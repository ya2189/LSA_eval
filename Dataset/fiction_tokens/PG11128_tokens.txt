freeman
preface
in
writing
the
following
story
the
author
has
had
in
view
no
purpose
other
than
that
of
affording
entertainment
to
such
readers
as
are
interested
in
problems
of
crime
and
their
solutions
and
the
story
itself
differs
in
no
respect
from
others
of
its
class
excepting
in
that
an
effort
has
been
made
to
keep
within
the
probabilities
of
ordinary
life
both
in
the
characters
and
in
the
incidents
nevertheless
it
may
happen
that
the
book
may
serve
a
useful
purpose
in
drawing
attention
to
certain
popular
misapprehensions
on
the
subject
of
and
their
evidential
value
misapprehensions
the
extent
of
which
may
be
judged
when
we
learn
from
the
newspapers
that
several
continental
commercial
houses
have
actually
substituted
for
signed
initials
the
facts
and
figures
contained
in
singleton
evidence
including
the
very
liberal
estimate
of
the
population
of
the
globe
are
of
course
taken
from
galton
great
and
important
work
on
to
which
the
reader
who
is
interested
in
the
subject
is
referred
for
much
curious
and
valuable
information
in
conclusion
the
author
desires
to
express
his
thanks
to
his
friend
bernard
bishop
for
the
assistance
rendered
to
him
in
certain
photographic
experiments
and
to
those
officers
of
the

very

the
words
set
in
four
panels
which
formed
a
frieze
beneath
the
pediment
of
a
fine
brick
portico
summarised
the
history
of
one
of
the
tall
houses
at
the
upper
end
of
king
bench
walk
and
as
i
somewhat
absently
read
over
the
inscription
my
attention
was
divided
between
admiration
of
the
exquisitely
finished
carved
brickwork
and
the
quiet
dignity
of
the
building
and
an
effort
to
reconstitute
the
dead
and
gone
richard
powell
and
the
stirring
times
in
which
he
played
his
part
i
was
about
to
turn
away
when
the
empty
frame
of
the
portico
became
occupied
by
a
figure
and
one
so
appropriate
in
its
wig
and
obsolete
habiliments
to
the
surroundings
that
it
seemed
to
complete
the
picture
and
i
lingered
idly
to
look
at
it
the
barrister
had
halted
in
the
doorway
to
turn
over
a
sheaf
of
papers
that
he
held
in
his
hand
and
as
he
replaced
the
red
tape
which
bound
them
together
he
looked
up
and
our
eyes
met
for
a
moment
we
regarded
one
another
with
the
incurious
gaze
that
casual
strangers
bestow
on
one
another
then
there
was
a
flash
of
mutual
recognition
the
impassive
and
rather
severe
face
of
the
lawyer
softened
into
a
genial
smile
and
the
figure
detaching
itself
from
its
frame
came
down
the
steps
with
a
hand
extended
in
cordial
greeting
my
dear
jervis
he
exclaimed
as
we
clasped
hands
warmly
this
is
a
great
and
delightful
surprise
how
often
have
i
thought
of
my
old
comrade
and
wondered
if
i
should
ever
see
him
again
and
lo
here
he
is
thrown
up
on
the
sounding
beach
of
the
inner
temple
like
the
proverbial
bread
cast
upon
the
waters
your
surprise
thorndyke
is
nothing
to
mine
i
replied
for
your
bread
has
at
least
returned
as
bread
whereas
i
am
in
the
position
of
a
man
who
having
cast
his
bread
upon
the
waters
sees
it
return
in
the
form
of
a
buttered
muffin
or
a
bath
bun
i
left
a
respectable
medical
practitioner
and
i
find
him
transformed
into
a
bewigged
and
begowned
limb
of
the
law
thorndyke
laughed
at
the
comparison
liken
not
your
old
friend
unto
a
bath
bun
said
he
say
rather
that
you
left
him
a
chrysalis
and
come
back
to
find
him
a
butterfly
but
the
change
is
not
so
great
as
you
think
hippocrates
is
only
hiding
under
the
gown
of
solon
as
you
will
understand
when
i
explain
my
metamorphosis
and
that
i
will
do
this
very
evening
if
you
have
no
engagement
i
am
one
of
the
unemployed
at
present
i
said
and
quite
at
your
service
then
come
round
to
my
chambers
at
seven
said
thorndyke
and
we
will
have
a
chop
and
a
pint
of
claret
together
and
exchange
autobiographies
i
am
due
in
court
in
a
few
minutes
do
you
reside
within
that
noble
old
portico
i
asked
no
replied
thorndyke
i
often
wish
i
did
it
would
add
several
inches
to
one
stature
to
feel
that
the
mouth
of
one
burrow
was
graced
with
a
latin
inscription
for
admiring
strangers
to
ponder
over
no
my
chambers
are
some
doors
further
down
number
and
he
turned
to
point
out
the
house
as
we
crossed
towards
crown
office
row
at
the
top
of
middle
temple
lane
we
parted
thorndyke
taking
his
way
with
fluttering
gown
towards
the
law
courts
while
i
directed
my
steps
westward
towards
adam
street
the
chosen
haunt
of
the
medical
agent
the
bell
of
the
temple
clock
was
telling
out
the
hour
of
seven
in
muffled
accents
as
though
it
apologised
for
breaking
the
studious
silence
as
i
emerged
from
the
archway
of
mitre
court
and
turned
into
king
bench
walk
the
paved
footway
was
empty
save
for
a
single
figure
pacing
slowly
before
the
doorway
of
number
in
which
though
the
wig
had
now
given
place
to
a
felt
hat
and
the
gown
to
a
jacket
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
my
friend
punctual
to
the
moment
as
of
old
said
he
meeting
me
what
a
blessed
virtue
is
punctuality
even
in
small
things
i
have
just
been
taking
the
air
in
fountain
court
and
will
now
introduce
you
to
my
chambers
here
is
my
humble
retreat
we
passed
in
through
the
common
entrance
and
ascended
the
stone
stairs
to
the
first
floor
where
we
were
confronted
by
a
massive
door
above
which
my
friend
name
was
written
in
white
letters
rather
a
forbidding
exterior
remarked
thorndyke
as
he
inserted
the
latchkey
but
it
is
homely
enough
inside
the
heavy
door
swung
outwards
and
disclosed
a
inner
door
which
thorndyke
pushed
open
and
held
for
me
to
pass
in
you
will
find
my
chambers
an
odd
mixture
said
thorndyke
for
they
combine
the
attractions
of
an
office
a
museum
a
laboratory
and
a
workshop
and
a
restaurant
added
a
small
elderly
man
who
was
decanting
a
bottle
of
claret
by
means
of
a
glass
syphon
you
forgot
that
sir
yes
i
forgot
that
polton
said
thorndyke
but
i
see
you
have
not
he
glanced
towards
a
small
table
that
had
been
placed
near
the
fire
and
set
out
with
the
requisites
for
our
meal
tell
me
said
thorndyke
as
we
made
the
initial
onslaught
on
the
products
of
polton
culinary
experiments
what
has
been
happening
to
you
since
you
left
the
hospital
six
years
ago
my
story
is
soon
told
i
answered
somewhat
bitterly
it
is
not
an
uncommon
one
my
funds
ran
out
as
you
know
rather
unexpectedly
when
i
had
paid
my
examination
and
registration
fees
the
coffer
was
absolutely
empty
and
though
no
doubt
a
medical
diploma
contains
to
use
johnson
phrase
the
potentiality
of
wealth
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
practice
between
the
potential
and
the
actual
i
have
in
fact
been
earning
a
subsistence
sometimes
as
an
assistant
sometimes
as
a
just
now
i
got
no
work
to
do
and
so
have
entered
my
name
on
turcival
list
of
eligibles
thorndyke
pursed
up
his
lips
and
frowned
it
a
wicked
shame
jervis
said
he
presently
that
a
man
of
your
abilities
and
scientific
acquirements
should
be
frittering
away
his
time
on
odd
jobs
like
some
wastrel
it
is
i
agreed
my
merits
are
grossly
undervalued
by
a
and
obtuse
generation
but
what
would
you
have
my
learned
brother
if
poverty
steps
behind
you
and
claps
the
occulting
bushel
over
your
thirty
thousand
luminary
your
brilliancy
is
apt
to
be
obscured
yes
i
suppose
that
is
so
grunted
thorndyke
and
he
remained
for
a
time
in
deep
thought
and
now
said
i
let
us
have
your
promised
explanation
i
am
positively
frizzling
with
curiosity
to
know
what
chain
of
circumstances
has
converted
john
evelyn
thorndyke
from
a
medical
practitioner
into
a
luminary
of
the
law
thorndyke
smiled
indulgently
the
fact
is
said
he
that
no
such
transformation
has
occurred
john
evelyn
thorndyke
is
still
a
medical
practitioner
what
in
a
wig
and
gown
i
exclaimed
yes
a
mere
sheep
in
wolf
clothing
he
replied
i
will
tell
you
how
it
has
come
about
after
you
left
the
hospital
six
years
ago
i
stayed
on
taking
up
any
small
appointments
that
were
going
assistant
demonstrator
or
curatorships
and
such
like
hung
about
the
chemical
and
physical
laboratories
the
museum
and
post
mortem
room
and
meanwhile
took
my
and
then
i
got
called
to
the
bar
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
coronership
but
soon
after
this
old
stedman
retired
unexpectedly
you
remember
stedman
the
lecturer
on
medical
jurisprudence
and
i
put
in
for
the
vacant
post
rather
to
my
surprise
i
was
appointed
lecturer
whereupon
i
dismissed
the
coronership
from
my
mind
took
my
present
chambers
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
anything
that
might
come
and
what
has
come
i
asked
why
a
very
curious
assortment
of
miscellaneous
practice
he
replied
at
first
i
only
got
an
occasional
analysis
in
a
doubtful
poisoning
case
but
by
degrees
my
sphere
of
influence
has
extended
until
it
now
includes
all
cases
in
which
a
special
knowledge
of
medicine
or
physical
science
can
be
brought
to
bear
upon
law
but
you
plead
in
court
i
observe
said
i
very
seldom
he
replied
more
usually
i
appear
in
the
character
of
that
of
judges
and
counsel
the
scientific
witness
but
in
most
instances
i
do
not
appear
at
all
i
merely
direct
investigations
arrange
and
analyse
the
results
and
prime
the
counsel
with
facts
and
suggestions
for
a
good
deal
more
interesting
than
acting
as
understudy
for
an
absent
said
i
a
little
enviously
but
you
deserve
to
succeed
for
you
were
always
a
deuce
of
a
worker
to
say
nothing
of
your
capabilities
yes
i
worked
hard
replied
thorndyke
and
i
work
hard
still
but
i
have
my
hours
of
labour
and
my
hours
of
leisure
unlike
you
poor
devils
of
general
practitioners
who
are
liable
to
be
dragged
away
from
the
dinner
table
or
roused
out
of
your
first
sleep
by
confound
it
all
who
can
that
be
for
at
this
moment
as
a
sort
of
commentary
on
his
there
came
a
smart
rapping
at
the
outer
door
must
see
who
it
is
i
suppose
he
continued
though
one
expects
people
to
accept
the
hint
of
a
closed
oak
he
strode
across
the
room
and
flung
open
the
door
with
an
air
of
by
no
means
gracious
inquiry
it
rather
late
for
a
business
call
said
an
apologetic
voice
outside
but
my
client
was
anxious
to
see
you
without
delay
come
in
lawley
said
thorndyke
rather
stiffly
and
as
he
held
the
door
open
the
two
visitors
entered
they
were
both
men
one
rather
foxy
in
appearance
and
of
a
typically
legal
aspect
and
the
other
a
fine
handsome
young
fellow
of
very
prepossessing
exterior
though
at
present
rather
pale
and
and
evidently
in
a
state
of
profound
agitation
i
am
afraid
said
the
latter
with
a
glance
at
me
and
the
dinner
table
that
our
visit
for
which
i
am
alone
responsible
is
a
most
unseasonable
one
if
we
are
really
inconveniencing
you
thorndyke
pray
tell
us
and
my
business
must
wait
thorndyke
had
cast
a
keen
and
curious
glance
at
the
young
man
and
he
now
replied
in
a
much
more
genial
tone
i
take
it
that
your
business
is
of
a
kind
that
will
not
wait
and
as
to
inconveniencing
us
why
my
friend
and
i
are
both
doctors
and
as
you
are
aware
no
doctor
expects
to
call
any
part
of
the
hours
his
own
unreservedly
i
had
risen
on
the
entrance
of
the
two
strangers
and
now
proposed
to
take
a
walk
on
the
embankment
and
return
later
but
the
young
man
interrupted
me
pray
do
go
away
on
my
account
he
said
the
facts
that
i
am
about
to
lay
before
thorndyke
will
be
known
to
all
the
world
by
this
time
so
there
is
no
occasion
for
any
show
of
secrecy
in
that
case
said
thorndyke
let
us
draw
our
chairs
up
to
the
fire
and
fall
to
business
forthwith
we
had
just
finished
our
dinner
and
were
waiting
for
the
coffee
which
i
hear
my
man
bringing
down
at
this
moment
we
accordingly
drew
up
our
chairs
and
when
polton
had
set
the
coffee
on
the
table
and
retired
the
lawyer
plunged
into
the
matter
without
preamble
chapter
ii
the
suspect
i
had
better
said
he
give
you
a
general
outline
of
the
case
as
it
presents
itself
to
the
legal
mind
and
then
my
client
reuben
hornby
can
fill
in
the
details
if
necessary
and
answer
any
questions
that
you
may
wish
to
put
to
him
reuben
occupies
a
position
of
trust
in
the
business
of
his
uncle
john
hornby
who
is
a
gold
and
silver
refiner
and
dealer
in
precious
metals
generally
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
outside
assay
work
carried
on
in
the
establishment
but
the
main
business
consists
in
the
testing
and
refining
of
samples
of
gold
sent
from
certain
mines
in
south
africa
about
five
years
ago
reuben
and
his
cousin
walter
another
nephew
of
john
hornby
left
school
and
both
were
articled
to
their
uncle
with
the
view
to
their
ultimately
becoming
partners
in
the
house
and
they
have
remained
with
him
ever
since
occupying
as
i
have
said
positions
of
considerable
responsibility
and
now
for
a
few
words
as
to
how
business
is
conducted
in
establishment
the
samples
of
gold
are
handed
over
at
the
docks
to
some
accredited
representative
of
the
firm
generally
either
reuben
or
walter
who
has
been
despatched
to
meet
the
ship
and
conveyed
either
to
the
bank
or
to
the
works
according
to
circumstances
of
course
every
effort
is
made
to
have
as
little
gold
as
possible
on
the
premises
and
the
bars
are
always
removed
to
the
bank
at
the
earliest
opportunity
but
it
happens
unavoidably
that
samples
of
considerable
value
have
often
to
remain
on
the
premises
all
night
and
so
the
works
are
furnished
with
a
large
and
powerful
safe
or
strong
room
for
their
reception
this
safe
is
situated
in
the
private
office
under
the
eye
of
the
principal
and
as
an
additional
precaution
the
caretaker
who
acts
as
occupies
a
room
directly
over
the
office
and
patrols
the
building
periodically
through
the
night
now
a
very
strange
thing
has
occurred
with
regard
to
this
safe
it
happens
that
one
of
hornby
customers
in
south
africa
is
interested
in
a
diamond
mine
and
although
transactions
in
precious
stones
form
no
part
of
the
business
of
the
house
he
has
from
time
to
time
sent
parcels
of
rough
diamonds
addressed
to
hornby
to
be
either
deposited
in
the
bank
or
handed
on
to
the
diamond
brokers
a
fortnight
ago
hornby
was
advised
that
a
parcel
of
stones
had
been
despatched
by
the
and
it
appeared
that
the
parcel
was
an
unusually
large
one
and
contained
stones
of
exceptional
size
and
value
under
these
circumstances
reuben
was
sent
down
to
the
docks
at
an
early
hour
in
the
hope
the
ship
might
arrive
in
time
for
the
stones
to
be
lodged
in
the
bank
at
once
unfortunately
however
this
was
not
the
case
and
the
diamonds
had
to
be
taken
to
the
works
and
locked
up
in
the
safe
who
placed
them
in
the
safe
asked
thorndyke
hornby
himself
to
whom
reuben
delivered
up
the
package
on
his
return
from
the
docks
yes
said
thorndyke
and
what
happened
next
well
on
the
following
morning
when
the
safe
was
opened
the
diamonds
had
disappeared
had
the
place
been
broken
into
asked
thorndyke
no
the
place
was
all
locked
up
as
usual
and
the
caretaker
who
had
made
his
accustomed
rounds
had
heard
nothing
and
the
safe
was
outwardly
quite
undisturbed
it
had
evidently
been
opened
with
keys
and
locked
again
after
the
stones
were
removed
and
in
whose
custody
were
the
keys
of
the
safe
inquired
thorndyke
hornby
usually
kept
the
keys
himself
but
on
occasions
when
he
was
absent
from
the
office
he
handed
them
over
to
one
of
his
nephews
whichever
happened
to
be
in
charge
at
the
time
but
on
this
occasion
the
keys
did
not
go
out
of
his
custody
from
the
time
when
he
locked
up
the
safe
after
depositing
the
diamonds
in
it
to
the
time
when
it
was
opened
by
him
on
the
following
morning
and
was
there
anything
that
tended
to
throw
suspicion
upon
anyone
asked
thorndyke
why
yes
said
lawley
with
an
uncomfortable
glance
at
his
client
unfortunately
there
was
it
seemed
that
the
person
who
abstracted
the
diamonds
must
have
cut
or
scratched
his
thumb
or
finger
in
some
way
for
there
were
two
drops
of
blood
on
the
bottom
of
the
safe
and
one
or
two
bloody
smears
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
in
addition
a
remarkably
clear
imprint
of
a
thumb
also
in
blood
asked
thorndyke
yes
the
thumb
had
apparently
been
put
down
on
one
of
the
drops
and
then
while
still
wet
with
blood
had
been
pressed
on
the
paper
in
taking
hold
of
it
or
otherwise
well
and
what
next
well
said
the
lawyer
fidgeting
in
his
chair
to
make
a
long
story
short
the
has
been
identified
as
that
of
reuben
hornby
ha
exclaimed
thorndyke
the
plot
thickens
with
a
vengeance
i
had
better
jot
down
a
few
notes
before
you
proceed
any
further
he
took
from
a
drawer
a
small
notebook
on
the
cover
of
which
he
wrote
reuben
hornby
and
then
laying
the
book
open
on
a
which
he
rested
on
his
knee
he
made
a
few
brief
notes
now
he
said
when
he
had
finished
with
reference
to
this
there
is
no
doubt
i
suppose
as
to
the
identification
none
whatever
replied
lawley
the
scotland
yard
people
of
course
took
possession
of
the
paper
which
was
handed
to
the
director
of
the
department
for
examination
and
comparison
with
those
in
their
collection
the
report
of
the
experts
is
that
the
does
not
agree
with
any
of
the
of
criminals
in
their
possession
that
it
is
a
very
peculiar
one
inasmuch
as
the
on
the
bulb
of
the
thumb
which
is
a
remarkably
distinct
and
characteristic
one
is
crossed
by
the
scar
of
a
deep
cut
rendering
identification
easy
and
infallible
that
it
agrees
in
every
respect
with
the
of
reuben
hornby
and
is
in
fact
his
beyond
any
possible
doubt
is
there
any
possibility
asked
thorndyke
that
the
paper
bearing
the
could
have
been
introduced
by
any
person
no
answered
the
lawyer
it
is
quite
impossible
the
paper
on
which
the
mark
was
found
was
a
leaf
from
hornby
memorandum
block
he
had
pencilled
on
it
some
particulars
relating
to
the
diamonds
and
laid
it
on
the
parcel
before
he
closed
up
the
safe
was
anyone
present
when
hornby
opened
the
safe
in
the
morning
asked
thorndyke
no
he
was
alone
answered
the
lawyer
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
diamonds
were
missing
and
then
he
observed
the
paper
with
the
on
it
on
which
he
closed
and
locked
the
safe
and
sent
for
the
police
is
it
not
rather
odd
that
the
thief
did
not
notice
the
since
it
was
so
distinct
and
conspicuous
no
i
think
not
answered
lawley
the
paper
was
lying
face
downwards
on
the
bottom
of
the
safe
and
it
was
only
when
he
picked
it
up
and
turned
it
over
that
hornby
discovered
the
apparently
the
thief
had
taken
hold
of
the
parcel
with
the
paper
on
it
and
the
paper
had
afterwards
dropped
off
and
fallen
with
the
marked
surface
downwards
probably
when
the
parcel
was
transferred
to
the
other
hand
you
mentioned
said
thorndyke
that
the
experts
at
scotland
yard
have
identified
this
as
that
of
reuben
hornby
may
i
ask
how
they
came
to
have
the
opportunity
of
making
the
comparison
ah
said
lawley
thereby
hangs
a
very
curious
tale
of
coincidences
the
police
of
course
when
they
found
that
there
was
so
simple
a
means
of
identification
as
a
wished
to
take
of
all
the
employees
in
the
works
but
this
hornby
refused
to
sanction
rather
quixotically
as
it
seems
to
me
saying
that
he
would
not
allow
his
nephews
to
be
subjected
to
such
an
indignity
now
it
was
naturally
these
nephews
in
whom
the
police
were
chiefly
interested
seeing
that
they
alone
had
had
the
handling
of
the
keys
and
considerable
pressure
was
brought
to
bear
upon
hornby
to
have
the
taken
however
he
was
obdurate
scouting
the
idea
of
any
suspicion
attaching
to
either
of
the
gentlemen
in
whom
he
had
reposed
such
complete
confidence
and
whom
he
had
known
all
their
lives
and
so
the
matter
would
probably
have
remained
a
mystery
but
for
a
very
odd
circumstance
you
may
have
seen
on
the
bookstalls
and
in
shop
windows
an
appliance
called
a
or
some
such
name
consisting
of
a
small
book
of
blank
paper
for
collecting
the
of
one
friends
together
with
an
inking
pad
i
have
seen
those
devices
of
the
evil
one
said
thorndyke
in
fact
i
have
one
which
i
bought
at
charing
cross
station
well
it
seems
that
some
months
ago
hornby
the
wife
of
john
hornby
purchased
one
of
these
toys
as
a
matter
of
fact
interrupted
reuben
it
was
my
cousin
walter
who
bought
the
thing
and
gave
it
to
her
well
that
is
not
material
said
lawley
though
i
observed
that
thorndyke
made
a
note
of
the
fact
in
his
book
at
any
rate
hornby
became
possessed
of
one
of
these
appliances
and
proceeded
to
fill
it
with
the
of
her
friends
including
her
two
nephews
now
it
happened
that
the
detective
in
charge
of
this
case
called
yesterday
at
hornby
house
when
the
latter
was
absent
from
home
and
took
the
opportunity
of
urging
her
to
induce
her
husband
to
consent
to
have
the
of
her
nephews
taken
for
the
inspection
of
the
experts
at
scotland
yard
he
pointed
out
that
the
procedure
was
really
necessary
not
only
in
the
interests
of
justice
but
in
the
interests
of
the
young
men
themselves
who
were
regarded
with
considerable
suspicion
by
the
police
which
suspicion
would
be
completely
removed
if
it
could
be
shown
by
actual
comparison
that
the
could
not
have
been
made
by
either
of
them
moreover
it
seemed
that
both
the
young
men
had
expressed
their
willingness
to
have
the
test
applied
but
had
been
forbidden
by
their
uncle
then
hornby
had
a
brilliant
idea
she
suddenly
remembered
the
and
thinking
to
set
the
question
at
rest
once
for
all
fetched
the
little
book
and
showed
it
to
the
detective
it
contained
the
prints
of
both
thumbs
of
reuben
among
others
and
as
the
detective
had
with
him
a
photograph
of
the
incriminating
mark
the
comparison
was
made
then
and
there
and
you
may
imagine
hornby
horror
and
amazement
when
it
was
made
clear
that
the
print
of
her
nephew
reuben
left
thumb
corresponded
in
every
particular
with
the
that
was
found
in
the
safe
at
this
juncture
hornby
arrived
on
the
scene
and
was
of
course
overwhelmed
with
consternation
at
the
turn
events
had
taken
he
would
have
liked
to
let
the
matter
drop
and
make
good
the
loss
of
the
diamonds
out
of
his
own
funds
but
as
that
would
have
amounted
practically
to
compounding
a
felony
he
had
no
choice
but
to
prosecute
as
a
result
a
warrant
was
issued
for
the
arrest
of
reuben
and
was
executed
this
morning
and
my
client
was
taken
forthwith
to
bow
street
and
charged
with
the
robbery
was
any
evidence
taken
asked
thorndyke
no
only
evidence
of
arrest
the
prisoner
is
remanded
for
a
week
bail
having
been
accepted
in
two
sureties
of
five
hundred
pounds
each
thorndyke
was
silent
for
a
space
after
the
conclusion
of
the
narrative
like
me
he
was
evidently
not
agreeably
impressed
by
the
manner
which
seemed
to
take
his
client
guilt
for
granted
a
position
indeed
not
entirely
without
excuse
having
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
what
have
you
advised
your
client
to
do
thorndyke
asked
presently
i
have
recommended
him
to
plead
guilty
and
throw
himself
on
the
clemency
of
the
court
as
a
first
offender
you
must
see
for
yourself
that
there
is
no
defence
possible
the
young
man
flushed
crimson
but
made
no
remark
but
let
us
be
clear
how
we
stand
said
thorndyke
are
we
defending
an
innocent
man
or
are
we
endeavouring
to
obtain
a
light
sentence
for
a
man
who
admits
that
he
is
guilty
lawley
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
question
can
be
best
answered
by
our
client
himself
said
he
thorndyke
directed
an
inquiring
glance
at
reuben
hornby
remarking
you
are
not
called
upon
to
incriminate
yourself
in
any
way
hornby
but
i
must
know
what
position
you
intend
to
adopt
here
i
again
proposed
to
withdraw
but
reuben
interrupted
me
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
go
away
jervis
he
said
my
position
is
that
i
did
not
commit
this
robbery
and
that
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
or
about
the
that
was
found
in
the
safe
i
do
not
of
course
expect
you
to
believe
me
in
the
face
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
against
me
but
i
do
nevertheless
declare
in
the
most
solemn
manner
before
god
that
i
am
absolutely
innocent
of
this
crime
and
have
no
knowledge
of
it
whatever
then
i
take
it
that
you
did
not
plead
said
thorndyke
certainly
not
and
i
never
will
replied
reuben
hotly
you
would
not
be
the
first
innocent
man
by
very
many
who
has
entered
that
plea
remarked
lawley
it
is
often
the
best
policy
when
the
defence
is
hopelessly
weak
it
is
a
policy
that
will
not
be
adopted
by
me
rejoined
reuben
i
may
be
and
probably
shall
be
convicted
and
sentenced
but
i
shall
continue
to
maintain
my
innocence
whatever
happens
do
you
think
he
added
turning
to
thorndyke
that
you
can
undertake
my
defence
on
that
assumption
it
is
the
only
assumption
on
which
i
should
agree
to
undertake
the
case
replied
thorndyke
and
if
i
may
ask
the
question
pursued
reuben
anxiously
do
you
find
it
possible
to
conceive
that
i
may
really
be
innocent
certainly
i
do
thorndyke
replied
on
which
i
observed
eyebrows
rise
perceptibly
i
am
a
man
of
facts
not
an
advocate
and
if
i
found
it
impossible
to
entertain
the
hypothesis
of
your
innocence
i
should
not
be
willing
to
expend
time
and
energy
in
searching
for
evidence
to
prove
it
nevertheless
he
continued
seeing
the
light
of
hope
break
out
on
the
face
of
the
unfortunate
young
man
i
must
impress
upon
you
that
the
case
presents
enormous
difficulties
and
that
we
must
be
prepared
to
find
them
insuperable
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
i
expect
nothing
but
a
conviction
replied
reuben
in
a
calm
and
resolute
voice
and
can
face
it
like
a
man
if
only
you
do
not
take
my
guilt
for
granted
but
give
me
a
chance
no
matter
how
small
of
making
a
defence
everything
shall
be
done
that
i
am
capable
of
doing
said
thorndyke
that
i
can
promise
you
the
long
odds
against
us
are
themselves
a
spur
to
endeavour
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
now
let
me
ask
you
have
you
any
cuts
or
scratches
on
your
fingers
reuben
hornby
held
out
both
his
hands
for
my
colleague
inspection
and
i
noticed
that
they
were
powerful
and
shapely
like
the
hands
of
a
skilled
craftsman
though
faultlessly
kept
thorndyke
set
on
the
table
a
large
condenser
such
as
is
used
for
microscopic
work
and
taking
his
client
hand
brought
the
bright
spot
of
light
to
bear
on
each
finger
in
succession
examining
their
tips
and
the
parts
around
the
nails
with
the
aid
of
a
pocket
lens
a
fine
capable
hand
this
said
he
regarding
the
member
approvingly
as
he
finished
his
examination
but
i
do
perceive
any
trace
of
a
scar
on
either
the
right
or
left
will
you
go
over
them
jervis
the
robbery
took
place
a
fortnight
ago
so
there
has
been
time
for
a
small
cut
or
scratch
to
heal
and
disappear
entirely
still
the
matter
is
worth
noting
he
handed
me
the
lens
and
i
scrutinised
every
part
of
each
hand
without
being
able
to
detect
the
faintest
trace
of
any
recent
wound
there
is
one
other
matter
that
must
be
attended
to
before
you
go
said
thorndyke
pressing
the
electric
by
his
chair
i
will
take
one
or
two
prints
of
the
left
thumb
for
my
own
information
in
response
to
the
summons
polton
made
his
appearance
from
some
lair
unknown
to
me
but
presumably
the
laboratory
and
having
received
his
instructions
retired
and
presently
returned
carrying
a
box
which
he
laid
on
the
table
from
this
receptacle
thorndyke
drew
forth
a
bright
copper
plate
mounted
on
a
slab
of
hard
wood
a
small
printer
roller
a
tube
of
ink
and
a
number
of
cards
with
very
white
and
rather
glazed
surfaces
now
hornby
said
he
your
hands
i
see
are
beyond
criticism
as
to
cleanliness
but
we
will
nevertheless
give
the
thumb
a
final
polish
accordingly
he
proceeded
to
brush
the
bulb
of
the
thumb
with
a
and
having
rinsed
it
in
water
dried
it
with
a
silk
handkerchief
and
gave
it
a
final
rub
on
a
piece
of
chamois
leather
the
thumb
having
been
thus
prepared
he
squeezed
out
a
drop
of
the
thick
ink
on
to
the
copper
plate
and
spread
it
out
with
the
roller
testing
the
condition
of
the
film
from
time
to
time
by
touching
the
plate
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
and
taking
an
impression
on
one
of
the
cards
when
the
ink
had
been
rolled
out
to
the
requisite
thinness
he
took
reuben
hand
and
pressed
the
thumb
lightly
but
firmly
on
to
the
inked
plate
then
transferring
the
thumb
to
one
of
the
cards
which
he
directed
me
to
hold
steady
on
the
table
he
repeated
the
pressure
when
there
was
left
on
the
card
a
beautifully
sharp
and
clear
impression
of
the
bulb
of
the
thumb
the
tiny
papillary
ridges
being
shown
with
microscopic
distinctness
and
even
the
mouths
of
the
sweat
glands
which
appeared
as
rows
of
little
white
dots
on
the
black
lines
of
the
ridges
this
manoeuvre
was
repeated
a
dozen
times
on
two
of
the
cards
each
of
which
thus
received
six
impressions
thorndyke
then
took
one
or
two
rolled
prints
prints
produced
by
rolling
the
thumb
first
on
the
inked
slab
and
then
on
the
card
by
which
means
a
much
larger
portion
of
the
surface
of
the
thumb
was
displayed
in
a
single
print
and
now
said
thorndyke
that
we
may
be
furnished
with
all
the
necessary
means
of
comparison
we
will
take
an
impression
in
blood
the
thumb
was
accordingly
cleansed
and
dried
afresh
when
thorndyke
having
pricked
his
own
thumb
with
a
needle
squeezed
out
a
drop
of
blood
on
to
a
card
there
said
he
with
a
smile
as
he
spread
the
drop
out
with
the
needle
into
a
little
shallow
pool
it
is
not
every
lawyer
who
is
willing
to
shed
his
blood
in
the
interests
of
his
client
he
proceeded
to
make
a
dozen
prints
as
before
on
two
cards
writing
a
number
with
his
pencil
opposite
each
print
as
he
made
it
we
are
now
said
he
as
he
finally
cleansed
his
client
thumb
furnished
with
the
material
for
a
preliminary
investigation
and
if
you
will
now
give
me
your
address
hornby
we
may
consider
our
business
concluded
for
the
present
i
must
apologise
to
you
lawley
for
having
detained
you
so
long
with
these
experiments
the
lawyer
had
in
fact
been
viewing
the
proceedings
with
hardly
concealed
impatience
and
he
now
rose
with
evident
relief
that
they
were
at
an
end
i
have
been
highly
interested
he
said
mendaciously
though
i
confess
i
do
not
quite
fathom
your
intentions
and
by
the
way
i
should
like
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
on
another
matter
if
reuben
would
not
mind
waiting
for
me
in
the
square
just
a
few
minutes
not
at
all
said
reuben
who
was
i
perceived
in
no
way
deceived
by
the
lawyer
pretence
do
hurry
on
my
account
my
time
is
my
own
at
present
he
held
out
his
hand
to
thorndyke
who
grasped
it
cordially
hornby
said
the
latter
do
not
be
unreasonably
sanguine
but
at
the
same
time
do
not
lose
heart
keep
your
wits
about
you
and
let
me
know
at
once
if
anything
occurs
to
you
that
may
have
a
bearing
on
the
case
the
young
man
then
took
his
leave
and
as
the
door
closed
after
him
lawley
turned
towards
thorndyke
i
thought
i
had
better
have
a
word
with
you
alone
he
said
just
to
hear
what
line
you
propose
to
take
up
for
i
confess
that
your
attitude
has
puzzled
me
completely
what
line
would
you
propose
asked
thorndyke
well
said
the
lawyer
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
the
position
seems
to
be
this
our
young
friend
has
stolen
a
parcel
of
diamonds
and
has
been
found
out
at
least
that
is
how
the
matter
presents
itself
to
me
that
is
not
how
it
presents
itself
to
me
said
thorndyke
drily
he
may
have
taken
the
diamonds
or
he
may
not
i
have
no
means
of
judging
until
i
have
sifted
the
evidence
and
acquired
a
few
more
facts
this
i
hope
to
do
in
the
course
of
the
next
day
or
two
and
i
suggest
that
we
postpone
the
consideration
of
our
plan
of
campaign
until
i
have
seen
what
line
of
defence
it
is
possible
to
adopt
as
you
will
replied
the
lawyer
taking
up
his
hat
but
i
am
afraid
you
are
encouraging
the
young
rogue
to
entertain
hopes
that
will
only
make
his
fall
the
harder
to
say
nothing
of
our
own
position
we
want
to
make
ourselves
ridiculous
in
court
you
know
i
do
certainly
agreed
thorndyke
however
i
will
look
into
the
matter
and
communicate
with
you
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
he
stood
holding
the
door
open
as
the
lawyer
descended
the
stairs
and
when
the
footsteps
at
length
died
away
he
closed
it
sharply
and
turned
to
me
with
an
air
of
annoyance
the
rogue
he
remarked
does
not
appear
to
me
to
have
been
very
happy
in
his
choice
of
a
solicitor
by
the
way
jervis
i
understand
you
are
out
of
employment
just
now
that
is
so
i
answered
would
you
care
to
help
me
as
a
matter
of
business
of
course
to
work
up
this
case
i
have
a
lot
of
other
work
on
hand
and
your
assistance
would
be
of
great
value
to
me
i
said
with
great
truth
that
i
should
be
delighted
then
said
thorndyke
come
round
to
breakfast
and
we
will
settle
the
terms
and
you
can
commence
your
duties
at
once
and
now
let
us
light
our
pipes
and
finish
our
yarns
as
though
agitated
clients
and
solicitors
had
no
existence
chapter
iii
a
lady
in
the
case
when
i
arrived
at
thorndyke
chambers
on
the
following
morning
i
found
my
friend
already
hard
at
work
breakfast
was
laid
at
one
end
of
the
table
while
at
the
other
stood
a
microscope
of
the
pattern
used
for
examining
of
on
the
wide
stage
of
which
was
one
of
the
cards
bearing
six
in
blood
a
condenser
threw
a
bright
spot
of
light
on
the
card
which
thorndyke
had
been
examining
when
i
knocked
as
i
gathered
from
the
position
of
the
chair
which
he
now
pushed
back
against
the
wall
i
see
you
have
commenced
work
on
our
problem
i
remarked
as
in
response
to
a
double
ring
of
the
electric
bell
polton
entered
with
the
materials
for
our
repast
yes
answered
thorndyke
i
have
opened
the
campaign
supported
as
usual
by
my
trusty
eh
polton
the
little
man
whose
intellectual
refined
countenance
and
dignified
bearing
seemed
oddly
out
of
character
with
the
that
he
carried
smiled
proudly
and
with
a
glance
of
affectionate
admiration
at
my
friend
replied
yes
sir
we
have
been
letting
the
grass
grow
under
our
feet
there
a
beautiful
negative
washing
upstairs
and
a
bromide
enlargement
too
which
will
be
mounted
and
dried
by
the
time
you
have
finished
your
breakfast
a
wonderful
man
that
jervis
my
friend
observed
as
his
assistant
retired
looks
like
a
rural
dean
or
a
chancery
judge
and
was
obviously
intended
by
nature
to
be
a
professor
of
physics
as
an
actual
fact
he
was
first
a
watchmaker
then
a
maker
of
optical
instruments
and
now
he
is
mechanical
factotum
to
a
medical
jurist
he
is
my
is
polton
takes
an
idea
before
you
have
time
to
utter
it
but
you
will
make
his
more
intimate
acquaintance
where
did
you
pick
him
up
i
asked
he
was
an
at
the
hospital
when
i
first
met
him
miserably
ill
and
broken
a
victim
of
poverty
and
undeserved
misfortune
i
gave
him
one
or
two
little
jobs
and
when
i
found
what
class
of
man
he
was
i
took
him
permanently
into
my
service
he
is
perfectly
devoted
to
me
and
his
gratitude
is
as
boundless
as
it
is
uncalled
for
what
are
the
photographs
he
was
referring
to
i
asked
he
is
making
an
enlarged
of
one
of
the
on
bromide
paper
and
a
negative
of
the
same
size
in
case
we
want
the
print
repeated
you
evidently
have
some
expectation
of
being
able
to
help
poor
hornby
said
i
though
i
can
not
imagine
how
you
propose
to
go
to
work
to
me
his
case
seems
as
hopeless
a
one
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
one
does
like
to
condemn
him
but
yet
his
innocence
seems
almost
unthinkable
it
does
certainly
look
like
a
hopeless
case
thorndyke
agreed
and
i
see
no
way
out
of
it
at
present
but
i
make
it
a
rule
in
all
cases
to
proceed
on
the
strictly
classical
lines
of
inductive
inquiry
collect
facts
make
hypotheses
test
them
and
seek
for
verification
and
i
always
endeavour
to
keep
a
perfectly
open
mind
now
in
the
present
case
assuming
as
we
must
that
the
robbery
has
actually
taken
place
there
are
four
conceivable
hypotheses
that
the
robbery
was
committed
by
reuben
hornby
that
it
was
committed
by
walter
hornby
that
it
was
committed
by
john
hornby
or
that
it
was
committed
by
some
other
person
or
persons
the
last
hypothesis
i
propose
to
disregard
for
the
present
and
confine
myself
to
the
examination
of
the
other
three
you
do
think
it
possible
that
hornby
could
have
stolen
the
diamonds
out
of
his
own
safe
i
exclaimed
i
incline
at
present
to
no
one
theory
of
the
matter
replied
thorndyke
i
merely
state
the
hypotheses
john
hornby
had
access
to
the
diamonds
therefore
it
is
possible
that
he
stole
them
but
surely
he
was
responsible
to
the
owners
not
in
the
absence
of
gross
negligence
which
the
owners
would
have
difficulty
in
proving
you
see
he
was
what
is
called
a
gratuitous
bailee
and
in
such
a
case
no
responsibility
for
loss
lies
with
the
bailee
unless
there
has
been
gross
negligence
but
the
my
dear
fellow
i
exclaimed
how
can
you
possibly
get
over
that
i
do
know
that
i
can
answered
thorndyke
calmly
but
i
see
you
are
taking
the
same
view
as
the
police
who
persist
in
regarding
a
as
a
kind
of
magical
touchstone
a
final
proof
beyond
which
inquiry
need
not
go
now
this
is
an
entire
mistake
a
is
merely
a
fact
a
very
important
and
significant
one
i
admit
but
still
a
fact
which
like
any
other
fact
requires
to
be
weighed
and
measured
with
reference
to
its
evidential
value
and
what
do
you
propose
to
do
first
i
shall
first
satisfy
myself
that
the
suspected
is
identical
in
character
with
that
of
reuben
hornby
of
which
however
i
have
very
little
doubt
for
the
experts
may
fairly
be
trusted
in
their
own
speciality
and
then
i
shall
collect
fresh
facts
in
which
i
look
to
you
for
assistance
and
if
we
have
finished
breakfast
i
may
as
well
induct
you
into
your
new
duties
he
rose
and
rang
the
bell
and
then
fetching
from
the
office
four
small
notebooks
laid
them
before
me
on
the
table
one
of
these
books
said
he
we
will
devote
to
data
concerning
reuben
hornby
you
will
find
out
anything
you
can
anything
mind
no
matter
how
trivial
or
apparently
irrelevant
in
any
way
connected
with
him
and
enter
it
in
this
book
he
wrote
on
the
cover
reuben
hornby
and
passed
the
book
to
me
in
this
second
book
you
will
in
like
manner
enter
anything
that
you
can
learn
about
walter
hornby
and
in
the
third
book
data
concerning
john
hornby
as
to
the
fourth
book
you
will
keep
that
for
stray
facts
connected
with
the
case
but
not
coming
under
either
of
the
other
headings
and
now
let
us
look
at
the
product
of
industry
he
took
from
his
assistant
hand
a
photograph
ten
inches
long
by
eight
broad
done
on
glazed
bromide
paper
and
mounted
flatly
on
stiff
card
it
showed
a
greatly
magnified
of
one
of
the
in
which
all
the
minute
details
such
as
the
orifices
of
the
sweat
glands
and
trifling
irregularities
in
the
ridges
which
in
the
original
could
be
seen
only
with
the
aid
of
a
lens
were
plainly
visible
to
the
naked
eye
moreover
the
entire
print
was
covered
by
a
network
of
fine
black
lines
by
which
it
was
divided
into
a
multitude
of
small
squares
each
square
being
distinguished
by
a
number
excellent
polton
said
thorndyke
approvingly
a
most
admirable
enlargement
you
see
jervis
we
have
photographed
the
in
contact
with
a
numbered
micrometer
divided
into
square
twelfths
of
an
inch
the
magnification
is
eight
diameters
so
that
the
squares
are
here
each
of
an
inch
in
diameter
i
have
a
number
of
these
micrometers
of
different
scales
and
i
find
them
invaluable
in
examining
cheques
doubtful
signatures
and
such
like
i
see
you
have
packed
up
the
camera
and
the
microscope
polton
have
you
put
in
the
micrometer
yes
sir
replied
polton
and
the
objective
and
the
everything
is
in
the
case
and
i
have
put
rapid
plates
into
the
in
case
the
light
should
be
bad
then
we
will
go
forth
and
beard
the
scotland
yard
lions
in
their
den
said
thorndyke
putting
on
his
hat
and
gloves
but
surely
said
i
you
are
not
going
to
drag
that
great
microscope
to
scotland
yard
when
you
only
want
eight
diameters
have
you
a
dissecting
microscope
or
some
other
portable
instrument
we
have
a
most
delightful
instrument
of
the
dissecting
type
of
polton
own
make
he
shall
show
it
to
you
but
i
may
have
need
of
a
more
powerful
instrument
and
here
let
me
give
you
a
word
of
warning
whatever
you
may
see
me
do
make
no
comments
before
the
officials
we
are
seeking
information
not
giving
it
you
understand
at
this
moment
the
little
brass
knocker
on
the
inner
door
the
outer
oak
being
open
uttered
a
timid
and
apologetic
who
the
deuce
can
that
be
muttered
thorndyke
replacing
the
microscope
on
the
table
he
strode
across
to
the
door
and
opened
it
somewhat
brusquely
but
immediately
whisked
his
hat
off
and
i
then
perceived
a
lady
standing
on
the
threshold
dr
thorndyke
she
inquired
and
as
my
colleague
bowed
she
continued
i
ought
to
have
written
to
ask
for
an
appointment
but
the
matter
is
rather
urgent
it
concerns
reuben
hornby
and
i
only
learned
from
him
this
morning
that
he
had
consulted
you
pray
come
in
said
thorndyke
jervis
and
i
were
just
setting
out
for
scotland
yard
on
this
very
business
let
me
present
you
to
my
colleague
who
is
working
up
the
case
with
me
our
visitor
a
tall
handsome
girl
of
twenty
or
thereabouts
returned
my
bow
and
remarked
with
perfect
my
name
is
gibson
miss
juliet
gibson
my
business
is
of
a
very
simple
character
and
need
not
detain
you
many
minutes
she
seated
herself
in
the
chair
that
thorndyke
placed
for
her
and
continued
in
a
brisk
and
manner
i
must
tell
you
who
i
am
in
order
to
explain
my
visit
to
you
for
the
last
six
years
i
have
lived
with
and
hornby
although
i
am
no
relation
to
them
i
first
came
to
the
house
as
a
sort
of
companion
to
hornby
though
as
i
was
only
fifteen
at
the
time
i
need
hardly
say
that
my
duties
were
not
very
onerous
in
fact
i
think
hornby
took
me
because
i
was
an
orphan
without
the
proper
means
of
getting
a
livelihood
and
she
had
no
children
of
her
own
three
years
ago
i
came
into
a
little
fortune
which
rendered
me
independent
but
i
had
been
so
happy
with
my
kind
friends
that
i
asked
to
be
allowed
to
remain
with
them
and
there
i
have
been
ever
since
in
the
position
of
an
adopted
daughter
naturally
i
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
their
nephews
who
spend
a
good
part
of
their
time
at
the
house
and
i
need
not
tell
you
that
the
horrible
charge
against
reuben
has
fallen
upon
us
like
a
thunderbolt
now
what
i
have
come
to
say
to
you
is
this
i
do
not
believe
that
reuben
stole
those
diamonds
it
is
entirely
out
of
character
with
all
my
previous
experience
of
him
i
am
convinced
that
he
is
innocent
and
i
am
prepared
to
back
my
opinion
in
what
way
asked
thorndyke
by
supplying
the
sinews
of
war
replied
miss
gibson
i
understand
that
legal
advice
and
assistance
involves
considerable
expense
i
am
afraid
you
are
quite
correctly
informed
said
thorndyke
well
reuben
pecuniary
resources
are
i
am
sure
quite
small
so
it
is
necessary
for
his
friends
to
support
him
and
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
nothing
shall
be
left
undone
that
might
help
to
prove
his
innocence
if
i
make
myself
responsible
for
any
costs
that
he
is
unable
to
meet
i
should
prefer
of
course
not
to
appear
in
the
matter
if
it
could
be
avoided
your
friendship
is
of
an
eminently
practical
kind
miss
gibson
said
my
colleague
with
a
smile
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
costs
are
no
affair
of
mine
if
the
occasion
arose
for
the
exercise
of
your
generosity
you
would
have
to
approach
reuben
solicitor
through
the
medium
of
your
guardian
hornby
and
with
the
consent
of
the
accused
but
i
do
not
suppose
the
occasion
will
arise
although
i
am
very
glad
you
called
as
you
may
be
able
to
give
us
valuable
assistance
in
other
ways
for
example
you
might
answer
one
or
two
apparently
impertinent
questions
i
should
not
consider
any
question
impertinent
that
you
considered
necessary
to
ask
our
visitor
replied
then
said
thorndyke
i
will
venture
to
inquire
if
any
special
relations
exist
between
you
and
mr
reuben
you
look
for
the
inevitable
motive
in
a
woman
said
miss
gibson
laughing
and
flushing
a
little
no
there
have
been
no
tender
passages
between
reuben
and
me
we
are
merely
old
and
intimate
friends
in
fact
there
is
what
i
may
call
a
tendency
in
another
direction
walter
hornby
do
you
mean
that
you
are
engaged
to
mr
walter
oh
no
she
replied
but
he
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
he
has
asked
me
in
fact
more
than
once
and
i
really
believe
that
he
has
a
sincere
attachment
to
me
she
made
this
latter
statement
with
an
odd
air
as
though
the
thing
asserted
were
curious
and
rather
incredible
and
the
tone
was
evidently
noticed
by
thorndyke
as
well
as
me
for
he
rejoined
of
course
he
has
why
not
well
you
see
replied
miss
gibson
i
have
some
six
hundred
a
year
of
my
own
and
should
not
be
considered
a
bad
match
for
a
young
man
like
walter
who
has
neither
property
nor
expectations
and
one
naturally
takes
that
into
account
but
still
as
i
have
said
i
believe
he
is
quite
sincere
in
his
professions
and
not
merely
attracted
by
my
money
i
do
not
find
your
opinion
at
all
incredible
said
thorndyke
with
a
smile
even
if
walter
were
quite
a
mercenary
young
man
which
i
take
it
he
is
not
miss
gibson
flushed
very
prettily
as
she
replied
oh
pray
do
not
trouble
to
pay
me
compliments
i
assure
you
i
am
by
no
means
insensible
of
my
merits
but
with
regard
to
walter
hornby
i
should
be
sorry
to
apply
the
term
to
him
and
yet
well
i
have
never
met
a
young
man
who
showed
a
stronger
appreciation
of
the
value
of
money
he
means
to
succeed
in
life
and
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
and
do
i
understand
that
you
refused
him
yes
my
feelings
towards
him
are
quite
friendly
but
not
of
such
a
nature
as
to
allow
me
to
contemplate
marrying
him
and
now
to
return
for
a
moment
to
reuben
you
have
known
him
for
some
years
i
have
known
him
intimately
for
six
years
replied
miss
gibson
and
what
sort
of
character
do
you
give
him
speaking
from
my
own
observation
of
him
she
replied
i
can
say
that
i
have
never
known
him
to
tell
an
untruth
or
do
a
dishonourable
deed
as
to
theft
it
is
merely
ridiculous
his
habits
have
always
been
inexpensive
and
frugal
he
is
unambitious
to
a
fault
and
in
respect
to
the
chance
his
indifference
is
as
conspicuous
as
keenness
he
is
a
generous
man
too
although
careful
and
industrious
thank
you
miss
gibson
said
thorndyke
we
shall
apply
to
you
for
further
information
as
the
case
progresses
i
am
sure
that
you
will
help
us
if
you
can
and
that
you
can
help
us
if
you
will
with
your
clear
head
and
your
admirable
frankness
if
you
will
leave
us
your
card
jervis
and
i
will
keep
you
informed
of
our
prospects
and
ask
for
your
assistance
whenever
we
need
it
after
our
fair
visitor
had
departed
thorndyke
stood
for
a
minute
or
more
gazing
dreamily
into
the
fire
then
with
a
quick
glance
at
his
watch
he
resumed
his
hat
and
catching
up
the
microscope
handed
the
camera
case
to
me
and
made
for
the
door
how
the
time
goes
he
exclaimed
as
we
descended
the
stairs
but
it
has
been
wasted
jervis
hey
no
i
suppose
not
i
answered
tentatively
you
suppose
not
he
replied
why
here
is
as
pretty
a
little
problem
as
you
could
desire
what
would
be
called
in
the
jargon
of
the
novels
a
psychological
problem
and
it
is
your
business
to
work
it
out
too
you
mean
as
to
miss
gibson
relations
with
these
two
young
men
thorndyke
nodded
is
it
any
concern
of
ours
i
asked
certainly
it
is
he
replied
everything
is
a
concern
of
ours
at
this
preliminary
stage
we
are
groping
about
for
a
clue
and
must
let
nothing
pass
unscrutinised
well
then
to
begin
with
she
is
not
wildly
infatuated
with
walter
hornby
i
should
say
no
agreed
thorndyke
laughing
softly
we
may
take
it
that
the
canny
walter
has
not
inspired
a
grand
passion
then
i
resumed
if
i
were
a
suitor
for
miss
gibson
hand
i
think
i
would
sooner
stand
in
reuben
shoes
than
in
walter
there
again
i
am
with
you
said
thorndyke
go
on
well
i
continued
our
fair
visitor
conveyed
to
me
the
impression
that
her
evident
admiration
of
reuben
character
was
tempered
by
something
that
she
had
heard
from
a
third
party
that
expression
of
hers
from
my
own
observation
seemed
to
imply
that
her
observations
of
him
were
not
in
entire
agreement
with
somebody
else
good
man
exclaimed
thorndyke
slapping
me
on
the
back
to
the
undissembled
surprise
of
a
policeman
whom
we
were
passing
that
is
what
i
had
hoped
for
in
you
the
capacity
to
perceive
the
essential
underneath
the
obvious
yes
somebody
has
been
saying
something
about
our
client
and
the
thing
that
we
have
to
find
out
is
what
is
it
that
has
been
said
and
who
has
been
saying
it
we
shall
have
to
make
a
pretext
for
another
interview
with
miss
gibson
by
the
way
why
did
you
ask
her
what
she
meant
i
asked
foolishly
thorndyke
grinned
in
my
face
why
did
you
he
retorted
no
i
rejoined
i
suppose
it
is
not
politic
to
appear
too
discerning
let
me
carry
the
microscope
for
a
time
it
is
making
your
arm
ache
i
see
thanks
said
he
handing
the
case
to
me
and
rubbing
his
fingers
it
is
rather
ponderous
i
ca
make
out
what
you
want
with
this
great
instrument
i
said
a
common
pocket
lens
would
do
all
that
you
require
besides
a
objective
will
not
magnify
more
than
two
or
three
diameters
two
with
the
closed
replied
thorndyke
and
the
brings
it
up
to
four
polton
made
them
both
for
me
for
examining
cheques
and
other
large
objects
but
you
will
understand
when
you
see
me
use
the
instrument
and
remember
you
are
to
make
no
comments
we
had
by
this
time
arrived
at
the
entrance
to
scotland
yard
and
were
passing
up
the
narrow
thoroughfare
when
we
encountered
a
uniformed
official
who
halted
and
saluted
my
colleague
ah
i
thought
we
should
see
you
here
before
long
doctor
said
he
genially
i
heard
this
morning
that
you
have
this
case
in
hand
yes
replied
thorndyke
i
am
going
to
see
what
can
be
done
for
the
defence
well
said
the
officer
as
he
ushered
us
into
the
building
given
us
a
good
many
surprises
but
you
give
us
a
bigger
one
if
you
can
make
anything
of
this
it
a
foregone
conclusion
i
should
say
my
dear
fellow
said
thorndyke
there
is
no
such
thing
you
mean
that
there
is
a
case
against
the
accused
put
it
that
way
if
you
like
replied
the
officer
with
a
sly
smile
but
i
think
you
will
find
this
about
the
hardest
nut
you
ever
tried
your
teeth
on
and
they
pretty
strong
teeth
too
i
say
that
you
had
better
come
into
singleton
office
and
he
conducted
us
along
a
corridor
and
into
a
large
room
where
we
found
a
gentleman
seated
at
a
large
writing
table
d
doctor
said
the
latter
rising
and
holding
out
his
hand
i
can
guess
what
you
come
for
want
to
see
that
eh
quite
right
answered
thorndyke
and
then
having
introduced
me
he
continued
we
were
partners
in
the
last
game
but
we
are
on
opposite
sides
of
the
board
this
time
yes
agreed
singleton
and
we
are
going
to
give
you
he
unlocked
a
drawer
and
drew
forth
a
small
portfolio
from
which
he
extracted
a
piece
of
paper
which
he
laid
on
the
table
it
appeared
to
be
a
sheet
torn
from
a
perforated
memorandum
block
and
bore
the
pencilled
inscription
handed
in
by
reuben
at
at
one
end
was
a
dark
glossy
made
by
the
falling
of
a
drop
and
this
was
smeared
slightly
apparently
by
a
finger
or
thumb
having
been
pressed
on
it
near
to
it
were
two
or
three
smaller
smears
and
a
remarkably
distinct
and
clean
print
of
a
thumb
thorndyke
gazed
intently
at
the
paper
for
a
minute
or
two
scrutinising
the
and
the
smears
in
turn
but
making
no
remark
while
singleton
watched
his
impassive
face
with
expectant
curiosity
not
much
difficulty
in
identifying
that
mark
the
official
at
length
observed
no
agreed
thorndyke
it
is
an
excellent
impression
and
a
very
distinctive
pattern
even
without
the
scar
yes
rejoined
singleton
the
scar
makes
it
absolutely
conclusive
you
have
a
print
with
you
i
suppose
yes
replied
thorndyke
and
he
drew
from
a
wide
the
enlarged
photograph
at
the
sight
of
which
singleton
face
broadened
into
a
smile
you
do
want
to
put
on
spectacles
to
look
at
that
he
remarked
not
that
you
gain
anything
by
so
much
enlargement
three
diameters
is
ample
for
studying
the
i
see
you
have
divided
it
up
into
numbered
squares
not
a
bad
plan
but
ours
or
rather
galton
for
we
borrowed
the
method
from
him
is
better
for
this
purpose
he
drew
from
the
portfolio
a
photograph
of
the
which
appeared
magnified
to
about
four
inches
in
length
the
print
was
marked
by
a
number
of
figures
written
minutely
with
a
pen
each
figure
being
placed
on
an
island
a
loop
a
bifurcation
or
some
other
striking
and
characteristic
portion
of
the
this
system
of
marking
with
reference
numbers
said
singleton
is
better
than
your
method
of
squares
because
the
numbers
are
only
placed
at
points
which
are
important
for
comparison
whereas
your
squares
or
the
intersections
of
the
lines
fall
arbitrarily
on
important
or
unimportant
points
according
to
chance
besides
we
ca
let
you
mark
our
original
you
know
though
of
course
we
can
give
you
a
photograph
which
will
do
as
well
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
let
me
take
a
photograph
presently
said
thorndyke
certainly
replied
singleton
if
you
would
rather
have
one
of
your
own
taking
i
know
you
do
care
to
take
anything
on
trust
and
now
i
must
get
on
with
my
work
if
you
will
excuse
me
inspector
johnson
will
give
you
any
assistance
you
may
require
and
see
that
i
do
pocket
the
original
added
thorndyke
with
a
smile
at
the
inspector
who
had
shown
us
in
oh
i
see
to
that
said
the
latter
grinning
and
as
singleton
returned
to
his
table
thorndyke
unlocked
the
microscope
case
and
drew
forth
the
instrument
what
are
you
going
to
put
it
under
the
microscope
exclaimed
singleton
looking
round
with
a
broad
smile
must
do
something
for
my
fee
you
know
replied
thorndyke
as
he
set
up
the
microscope
and
screwed
on
two
extra
objectives
to
the
triple
you
observe
that
there
is
no
deception
he
added
to
the
inspector
as
he
took
the
paper
from
singleton
table
and
placed
it
between
two
slips
of
glass
i
watching
you
sir
replied
the
officer
with
a
chuckle
and
he
did
watch
with
close
attention
and
great
interest
while
thorndyke
laid
the
glass
slips
on
the
microscope
stage
and
proceeded
to
focus
i
also
watched
and
was
a
good
deal
exercised
in
my
mind
by
my
colleague
proceedings
after
a
preliminary
glance
with
the
glass
he
swung
round
the
to
the
objective
and
slipped
in
a
more
powerful
and
with
this
power
he
examined
the
carefully
and
then
moved
the
into
the
field
of
vision
after
looking
at
this
for
some
time
with
deep
attention
he
drew
from
the
case
a
tiny
spirit
lamp
which
was
evidently
filled
with
an
alcoholic
solution
of
some
sodium
salt
for
when
he
lit
it
i
recognised
the
characteristic
yellow
sodium
flame
then
he
replaced
one
of
the
objectives
by
a
spectroscopic
attachment
and
having
placed
the
little
lamp
close
to
the
microscope
mirror
adjusted
the
spectroscope
evidently
my
friend
was
fixing
the
position
of
the
d
line
or
sodium
line
in
the
spectrum
having
completed
the
adjustments
he
now
examined
afresh
the
and
the
both
by
transmitted
and
reflected
light
and
i
observed
him
hurriedly
draw
one
or
two
diagrams
in
his
notebook
then
he
replaced
the
spectroscope
and
lamp
in
the
case
and
brought
forth
the
micrometer
a
slip
of
rather
thin
glass
about
three
inches
by
one
and
a
half
which
he
laid
over
the
in
the
place
of
the
upper
plate
of
glass
having
secured
it
in
position
by
the
clips
he
moved
it
about
comparing
its
appearance
with
that
of
the
lines
on
the
large
photograph
which
he
held
in
his
hand
after
a
considerable
amount
of
adjustment
and
readjustment
he
appeared
to
be
satisfied
for
he
remarked
to
me
i
think
i
have
got
the
lines
in
the
same
position
as
they
are
on
our
print
so
with
inspector
johnson
assistance
we
will
take
a
photograph
which
we
can
examine
at
our
leisure
he
extracted
the
camera
a
instrument
from
its
case
and
opened
it
then
having
swung
the
microscope
on
its
stand
into
a
horizontal
position
he
produced
from
the
camera
case
a
slab
of
mahogany
with
three
brass
feet
on
which
he
placed
the
camera
and
which
brought
the
latter
to
a
level
with
the
of
the
microscope
the
front
of
the
camera
was
fitted
with
a
short
sleeve
of
thin
black
leather
and
into
this
the
end
of
the
microscope
was
now
passed
the
sleeve
being
secured
round
the
barrel
of
the
microscope
by
a
stout
indiarubber
band
thus
producing
a
completely
connection
everything
was
now
ready
for
taking
the
photograph
the
light
from
the
window
having
been
concentrated
on
the
by
means
of
a
condenser
thorndyke
proceeded
to
focus
the
image
on
the
screen
with
extreme
care
and
then
slipping
a
small
leather
cap
over
the
objective
introduced
the
dark
slide
and
drew
out
the
shutter
i
will
ask
you
to
sit
down
and
remain
quite
still
while
i
make
the
exposure
he
said
to
me
and
the
inspector
a
very
little
vibration
is
enough
to
destroy
the
sharpness
of
the
image
we
seated
ourselves
accordingly
and
thorndyke
then
removed
the
cap
standing
motionless
watch
in
hand
while
he
exposed
the
first
plate
we
may
as
well
take
a
second
in
case
this
should
not
turn
out
quite
perfect
he
said
as
he
replaced
the
cap
and
closed
the
shutter
he
reversed
the
dark
slide
and
made
another
exposure
in
the
same
way
and
then
having
removed
the
micrometer
and
replaced
it
by
a
slip
of
plain
glass
he
made
two
more
exposures
there
are
two
plates
left
he
remarked
as
he
drew
out
the
second
dark
slide
i
think
i
will
take
a
record
of
the
on
them
he
accordingly
made
two
more
exposures
one
of
the
larger
and
one
of
the
smaller
smears
there
said
he
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
as
he
proceeded
to
pack
up
what
the
inspector
described
as
his
box
of
tricks
i
think
we
have
all
the
data
that
we
can
squeeze
out
of
scotland
yard
and
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
singleton
for
giving
so
many
facilities
to
your
natural
enemy
the
counsel
for
the
defence
not
our
natural
enemies
doctor
protested
singleton
we
work
for
a
conviction
of
course
but
we
do
throw
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
defence
you
know
that
perfectly
well
of
course
i
do
my
dear
sir
replied
thorndyke
shaking
the
official
by
the
hand
have
i
benefited
by
your
help
a
score
of
times
but
i
am
greatly
obliged
all
the
same
doctor
i
wish
you
luck
though
i
fear
you
will
find
it
go
this
time
we
shall
see
replied
thorndyke
and
with
a
friendly
wave
of
the
hand
to
the
inspector
he
caught
up
the
two
cases
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
building
chapter
iv
confidences
during
our
walk
home
my
friend
was
unusually
thoughtful
and
silent
and
his
face
bore
a
look
of
concentration
under
which
i
thought
i
could
detect
in
spite
of
his
habitually
impassive
expression
a
certain
suppressed
excitement
of
a
not
entirely
unpleasurable
kind
i
forbore
however
from
making
any
remarks
or
asking
questions
not
only
because
i
saw
that
he
was
preoccupied
but
also
because
from
my
knowledge
of
the
man
i
judged
that
he
would
consider
it
his
duty
to
keep
his
own
counsel
and
to
make
no
unnecessary
confidences
even
to
me
on
our
arrival
at
his
chambers
he
immediately
handed
over
the
camera
to
polton
with
a
few
curt
directions
as
to
the
development
of
the
plates
and
lunch
being
already
prepared
we
sat
down
at
the
table
without
delay
we
had
proceeded
with
our
meal
in
silence
for
some
time
when
thorndyke
suddenly
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
looked
into
my
face
with
a
smile
of
quiet
amusement
it
has
just
been
borne
in
upon
me
jervis
said
he
that
you
are
the
most
companionable
fellow
in
the
world
you
have
the
gift
of
silence
if
silence
is
the
test
of
companionability
i
answered
with
a
grin
i
think
i
can
pay
you
a
similar
compliment
in
even
more
emphatic
terms
he
laughed
cheerfully
and
rejoined
you
are
pleased
to
be
sarcastic
i
observe
but
i
maintain
my
position
the
capacity
to
preserve
an
opportune
silence
is
the
rarest
and
most
precious
of
social
accomplishments
now
most
men
would
have
plied
me
with
questions
and
babbled
comments
on
my
proceedings
at
scotland
yard
whereas
you
have
allowed
me
to
sort
out
without
interruption
a
mass
of
evidence
while
it
is
still
fresh
and
impressive
to
docket
each
item
and
stow
it
away
in
the
pigeonholes
of
my
brain
by
the
way
i
have
made
a
ridiculous
oversight
what
is
that
i
asked
the
i
never
ascertained
whether
the
police
have
it
or
whether
it
is
still
in
the
possession
of
mrs
hornby
does
it
matter
i
inquired
not
much
only
i
must
see
it
and
perhaps
it
will
furnish
an
excellent
pretext
for
you
to
call
on
miss
gibson
as
i
am
busy
at
the
hospital
this
afternoon
and
polton
has
his
hands
full
it
would
be
a
good
plan
for
you
to
drop
in
at
endsley
gardens
that
is
the
address
i
think
and
if
you
can
see
miss
gibson
try
to
get
a
confidential
chat
with
her
and
extend
your
knowledge
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
three
messieurs
hornby
put
on
your
best
bedside
manner
and
keep
your
weather
eye
lifting
find
out
everything
you
can
as
to
the
characters
and
habits
of
those
three
gentlemen
regardless
of
all
scruples
of
delicacy
everything
is
of
importance
to
us
even
to
the
names
of
their
tailors
and
with
regard
to
the
find
out
who
has
it
and
if
it
is
still
in
hornby
possession
get
her
to
lend
it
to
us
or
what
might
perhaps
be
better
get
her
permission
to
take
a
photograph
of
it
it
shall
be
done
according
to
your
word
said
i
i
will
furbish
up
my
exterior
and
this
very
afternoon
make
my
first
appearance
in
the
character
of
paul
pry
about
an
hour
later
i
found
myself
upon
the
doorstep
of
house
in
endsley
gardens
listening
to
the
jangling
of
the
bell
that
i
had
just
set
in
motion
miss
gibson
sir
repeated
the
parlourmaid
in
response
to
my
question
she
going
out
but
i
am
not
sure
whether
she
has
gone
yet
if
you
will
step
in
i
will
go
and
see
i
followed
her
into
the
and
threading
my
way
amongst
the
litter
of
small
tables
and
miscellaneous
furniture
by
which
ladies
nowadays
convert
their
special
domain
into
the
semblance
of
a
shop
let
go
my
anchor
in
the
vicinity
of
the
fireplace
to
await
the
parlourmaid
report
i
had
not
long
to
wait
for
in
less
than
a
minute
miss
gibson
herself
entered
the
room
she
wore
her
hat
and
gloves
and
i
congratulated
myself
on
my
timely
arrival
i
did
expect
to
see
you
again
so
soon
jervis
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
with
a
frank
and
friendly
manner
but
you
are
very
welcome
all
the
same
you
have
come
to
tell
me
something
on
the
contrary
i
replied
i
have
come
to
ask
you
something
well
that
is
better
than
nothing
she
said
with
a
shade
of
disappointment
wo
you
sit
down
i
seated
myself
with
caution
on
a
dwarf
chair
of
scrofulous
aspect
and
opened
my
business
without
preamble
do
you
remember
a
thing
called
a
indeed
i
do
she
replied
with
energy
it
was
the
cause
of
all
this
trouble
do
you
know
if
the
police
took
possession
of
it
the
detective
took
it
to
scotland
yard
that
the
experts
might
examine
it
and
compare
the
two
and
they
wanted
to
keep
it
but
hornby
was
so
distressed
at
the
idea
of
its
being
used
in
evidence
that
they
let
her
have
it
back
you
see
they
really
had
no
further
need
of
it
as
they
could
take
a
print
for
themselves
when
they
had
reuben
in
custody
in
fact
he
volunteered
to
have
a
print
taken
at
once
as
soon
as
he
was
arrested
and
that
was
done
so
the
is
now
in
hornby
possession
yes
unless
she
has
destroyed
it
she
spoke
of
doing
so
i
hope
she
has
not
said
i
in
some
alarm
for
thorndyke
is
extremely
anxious
for
some
reason
to
examine
it
well
she
will
be
down
in
a
few
minutes
and
then
we
shall
know
i
told
her
you
were
here
have
you
any
idea
what
thorndyke
reason
is
for
wanting
to
see
it
none
whatever
i
replied
thorndyke
is
as
close
as
an
oyster
he
treats
me
as
he
treats
every
one
else
he
listens
attentively
observes
closely
and
says
nothing
it
does
sound
very
agreeable
mused
miss
gibson
and
yet
he
seemed
very
nice
and
sympathetic
he
very
nice
and
sympathetic
i
retorted
with
some
emphasis
but
he
does
make
himself
agreeable
by
divulging
his
clients
secrets
i
suppose
not
and
i
regard
myself
as
very
effectively
snubbed
said
she
smiling
but
evidently
somewhat
piqued
by
my
not
very
tactful
observation
i
was
hastening
to
repair
my
error
with
apologies
and
when
the
door
opened
and
an
elderly
lady
entered
the
room
she
was
somewhat
stout
amiable
and
placid
of
mien
and
impressed
me
to
be
entirely
truthful
as
looking
rather
foolish
here
is
hornby
said
miss
gibson
presenting
me
to
her
hostess
and
she
continued
jervis
has
come
to
ask
about
the
you
have
destroyed
it
i
hope
no
my
dear
replied
hornby
i
have
it
in
my
little
bureau
what
did
jervis
wish
to
know
about
it
seeing
that
she
was
terrified
lest
some
new
and
dreadful
surprise
should
be
sprung
upon
her
i
hastened
to
reassure
her
my
colleague
thorndyke
is
anxious
to
examine
it
he
is
directing
your
nephew
defence
you
know
yes
yes
said
hornby
juliet
told
me
about
him
she
says
he
is
a
dear
do
you
agree
with
her
here
i
caught
miss
gibson
eye
in
which
was
a
mischievous
twinkle
and
noted
a
little
deeper
pink
in
her
cheeks
well
i
answered
dubiously
i
have
never
considered
my
colleague
in
the
capacity
of
a
dear
but
i
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
him
in
every
respect
that
no
doubt
is
the
masculine
equivalent
said
miss
gibson
recovering
from
the
momentary
embarrassment
that
hornby
artless
repetition
of
her
phrase
had
produced
i
think
the
feminine
expression
is
more
epigrammatic
and
comprehensive
but
to
return
to
the
object
of
jervis
visit
would
you
let
him
have
the
aunt
to
show
to
dr
thorndyke
oh
my
dear
juliet
replied
hornby
i
would
do
anything
anything
to
help
our
poor
boy
i
will
never
believe
that
he
could
be
guilty
of
theft
common
vulgar
theft
there
has
been
some
dreadful
mistake
i
am
convinced
there
has
i
told
the
detectives
so
i
assured
them
that
reuben
could
not
have
committed
the
robbery
and
that
they
were
totally
mistaken
in
supposing
him
to
be
capable
of
such
an
action
but
they
would
not
listen
to
me
although
i
have
known
him
since
he
was
a
little
child
and
ought
to
be
able
to
judge
if
anyone
is
diamonds
too
now
i
ask
you
what
could
reuben
want
with
diamonds
and
they
were
not
even
cut
here
hornby
drew
forth
a
handkerchief
and
mopped
her
eyes
i
am
sure
thorndyke
will
be
very
much
interested
to
see
this
little
book
of
yours
said
i
with
a
view
to
stemming
the
tide
of
her
reflections
oh
the
she
replied
yes
i
will
let
him
have
it
with
the
greatest
pleasure
i
am
so
glad
he
wishes
to
see
it
it
makes
one
feel
hopeful
to
know
that
he
is
taking
so
much
interest
in
the
case
would
you
believe
it
jervis
those
detective
people
actually
wanted
to
keep
it
to
bring
up
in
evidence
against
the
poor
boy
my
mind
you
but
i
put
my
foot
down
there
and
they
had
to
return
it
i
was
resolved
that
they
should
not
receive
any
assistance
from
me
in
their
efforts
to
involve
my
nephew
in
this
horrible
affair
then
perhaps
said
miss
gibson
you
might
give
jervis
the
and
he
can
hand
it
to
dr
thorndyke
of
course
i
will
said
hornby
instantly
and
you
need
not
return
it
jervis
when
you
have
finished
with
it
fling
it
into
the
fire
i
wish
never
to
see
it
again
but
i
had
been
considering
the
matter
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
highly
indiscreet
to
take
the
book
out
of
custody
and
this
i
now
proceeded
to
explain
i
have
no
idea
i
said
for
what
purpose
thorndyke
wishes
to
examine
the
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
he
may
desire
to
put
it
in
evidence
in
which
case
it
would
be
better
that
it
should
not
go
out
of
your
possession
for
the
present
he
merely
commissioned
me
to
ask
for
your
permission
to
take
a
photograph
of
it
oh
if
he
wants
a
photograph
said
hornby
i
could
get
one
done
for
him
without
any
difficulty
my
nephew
walter
would
take
one
for
us
i
am
sure
if
i
asked
him
he
is
so
clever
you
know
is
he
not
juliet
dear
yes
aunt
replied
miss
gibson
quickly
but
i
expect
thorndyke
would
rather
take
the
photograph
himself
i
am
sure
he
would
i
agreed
in
fact
a
photograph
taken
by
another
person
would
not
be
of
much
use
to
him
ah
said
hornby
in
a
slightly
injured
tone
you
think
walter
is
just
an
ordinary
amateur
but
if
i
were
to
show
you
some
of
the
photographs
he
has
taken
you
would
really
be
surprised
he
is
remarkably
clever
i
assure
you
would
you
like
us
to
bring
the
book
to
thorndyke
chambers
asked
miss
gibson
that
would
save
time
and
trouble
it
is
excessively
good
of
you
i
began
not
at
all
when
shall
we
bring
it
would
you
like
to
have
it
this
evening
we
should
very
much
i
replied
my
colleague
could
then
examine
it
and
decide
what
is
to
be
done
with
it
but
it
is
giving
you
so
much
trouble
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
said
miss
gibson
you
would
not
mind
coming
with
me
this
evening
would
you
aunt
certainly
not
my
dear
replied
hornby
and
she
was
about
to
enlarge
on
the
subject
when
miss
gibson
rose
and
looking
at
her
watch
declared
that
she
must
start
on
her
errand
at
once
i
also
rose
to
make
my
adieux
and
she
then
remarked
if
you
are
walking
in
the
same
direction
as
i
am
jervis
we
might
arrange
the
time
of
our
proposed
visit
as
we
go
along
i
was
not
slow
to
avail
myself
of
this
invitation
and
a
few
seconds
later
we
left
the
house
together
leaving
hornby
smiling
fatuously
after
us
from
the
open
door
will
eight
suit
you
do
you
think
miss
gibson
asked
as
we
walked
up
the
street
it
will
do
excellently
i
should
say
i
answered
if
anything
should
render
the
meeting
impossible
i
will
send
you
a
telegram
i
could
wish
that
you
were
coming
alone
as
ours
is
to
be
a
business
conference
miss
gibson
laughed
softly
and
a
very
pleasant
and
musical
laugh
it
was
yes
she
agreed
dear
hornby
is
a
little
diffuse
and
difficult
to
keep
to
one
subject
but
you
must
be
indulgent
to
her
little
failings
you
would
be
if
you
had
experienced
such
kindness
and
generosity
from
her
as
i
have
i
am
sure
i
should
i
rejoined
in
fact
i
am
after
all
a
little
diffuseness
of
speech
and
haziness
of
ideas
are
no
great
faults
in
a
generous
and
amiable
woman
of
her
age
miss
gibson
rewarded
me
for
these
highly
correct
sentiments
with
a
little
smile
of
approval
and
we
walked
on
for
some
time
in
silence
presently
she
turned
to
me
with
some
suddenness
and
a
very
earnest
expression
and
said
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
jervis
and
please
forgive
me
if
i
beg
you
to
put
aside
your
professional
reserve
just
a
little
in
my
favour
i
want
you
to
tell
me
if
you
think
thorndyke
has
any
kind
of
hope
or
expectation
of
being
able
to
save
poor
reuben
from
the
dreadful
peril
that
threatens
him
this
was
a
rather
pointed
question
and
i
took
some
time
to
consider
it
before
replying
i
should
like
i
replied
at
length
to
tell
you
as
much
as
my
duty
to
my
colleague
will
allow
me
to
but
that
is
so
little
that
it
is
hardly
worth
telling
however
i
may
say
this
without
breaking
any
confidence
thorndyke
has
undertaken
the
case
and
is
working
hard
at
it
and
he
would
most
assuredly
have
done
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
if
he
had
considered
it
a
hopeless
one
that
is
a
very
encouraging
view
of
the
matter
said
she
which
had
however
already
occurred
to
me
may
i
ask
if
anything
came
of
your
visit
to
scotland
yard
oh
please
do
think
me
encroaching
i
am
so
terribly
anxious
and
troubled
i
can
tell
you
very
little
about
the
results
of
our
expedition
for
i
know
very
little
but
i
have
an
idea
that
thorndyke
is
not
dissatisfied
with
his
morning
work
he
certainly
picked
up
some
facts
though
i
have
no
idea
of
their
nature
and
as
soon
as
we
reached
home
he
developed
a
sudden
desire
to
examine
the
thank
you
jervis
she
said
gratefully
you
have
cheered
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
and
i
wo
ask
you
any
more
questions
are
you
sure
i
am
not
bringing
you
out
of
the
way
not
at
all
i
answered
hastily
the
fact
is
i
had
hoped
to
have
a
little
chat
with
you
when
we
had
disposed
of
the
so
i
can
regard
myself
as
combining
a
little
business
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
if
i
am
allowed
to
accompany
you
she
gave
me
a
little
ironical
bow
as
she
inquired
and
in
short
i
may
take
it
that
i
am
to
be
pumped
come
now
i
retorted
you
have
been
plying
the
pump
handle
pretty
vigorously
yourself
but
that
is
not
my
meaning
at
all
you
see
we
are
absolute
strangers
to
all
the
parties
concerned
in
this
case
which
of
course
makes
for
an
impartial
estimate
of
their
characters
but
after
all
knowledge
is
more
useful
to
us
than
impartiality
there
is
our
client
for
instance
he
impressed
us
both
very
favourably
i
think
but
he
might
have
been
a
plausible
rascal
with
the
blackest
of
records
then
you
come
and
tell
us
that
he
is
a
gentleman
of
stainless
character
and
we
are
at
once
on
firmer
ground
i
see
said
miss
gibson
thoughtfully
and
suppose
that
i
or
some
one
else
had
told
you
things
that
seemed
to
reflect
on
his
character
would
they
have
influenced
you
in
your
attitude
towards
him
only
in
this
i
replied
that
we
should
have
made
it
our
business
to
inquire
into
the
truth
of
those
reports
and
ascertain
their
origin
that
is
what
one
should
always
do
i
suppose
said
she
still
with
an
air
of
deep
thoughtfulness
which
encouraged
me
to
inquire
may
i
ask
if
anyone
to
your
knowledge
has
ever
said
anything
to
reuben
disadvantage
she
pondered
for
some
time
before
replying
and
kept
her
eyes
bent
pensively
on
the
ground
at
length
she
said
not
without
some
hesitation
of
manner
it
is
a
small
thing
and
quite
without
any
bearing
on
this
affair
but
it
has
been
a
great
trouble
to
me
since
it
has
to
some
extent
put
a
barrier
between
reuben
and
me
and
we
used
to
be
such
close
friends
and
i
have
blamed
myself
for
letting
it
influence
me
perhaps
unjustly
in
my
opinion
of
him
i
will
tell
you
about
it
though
i
expect
you
will
think
me
very
foolish
you
must
know
then
that
reuben
and
i
used
until
about
six
months
ago
to
be
very
much
together
though
we
were
only
friends
you
understand
but
we
were
on
the
footing
of
relatives
so
there
was
nothing
out
of
the
way
in
it
reuben
is
a
keen
student
of
ancient
and
mediaeval
art
in
which
i
also
am
much
interested
so
we
used
to
visit
the
museums
and
galleries
together
and
get
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
from
comparing
our
views
and
impressions
of
what
we
saw
about
six
months
ago
walter
took
me
aside
one
day
and
with
a
very
serious
face
asked
me
if
there
was
any
kind
of
understanding
between
reuben
and
me
i
thought
it
rather
impertinent
of
him
but
nevertheless
i
told
him
the
truth
that
reuben
and
i
were
just
friends
and
nothing
more
that
is
the
case
said
he
looking
mighty
grave
would
advise
you
not
to
be
seen
about
with
him
quite
so
much
why
not
i
asked
very
naturally
the
fact
is
said
walter
reuben
is
a
confounded
fool
he
has
been
chattering
to
the
men
at
the
club
and
seems
to
have
given
them
the
impression
that
a
young
lady
of
means
and
position
has
been
setting
her
cap
at
him
very
hard
but
that
he
being
a
philosopher
above
the
temptations
that
beset
ordinary
mortals
is
superior
both
to
her
blandishments
and
her
pecuniary
attractions
i
give
you
the
hint
for
your
own
guidance
he
continued
i
expect
this
to
go
no
farther
you
must
be
annoyed
with
reuben
the
best
of
young
men
will
often
behave
like
prigs
and
donkeys
and
i
have
no
doubt
the
fellows
have
grossly
exaggerated
what
he
said
but
i
thought
it
right
to
put
you
on
your
guard
now
this
report
as
you
may
suppose
made
me
excessively
angry
and
i
wanted
to
have
it
out
with
reuben
then
and
there
but
walter
refused
to
sanction
this
was
no
use
in
making
a
scene
he
said
and
he
insisted
that
the
caution
was
given
to
me
in
strict
confidence
so
what
was
i
to
do
i
tried
to
ignore
it
and
treat
reuben
as
i
always
had
done
but
this
i
found
impossible
my
womanly
pride
was
much
too
deeply
hurt
and
yet
i
felt
it
the
lowest
depth
of
meanness
to
harbour
such
thoughts
of
him
without
giving
him
the
opportunity
to
defend
himself
and
although
it
was
most
unlike
reuben
in
some
respects
it
was
very
like
him
in
others
for
he
has
always
expressed
the
utmost
contempt
for
men
who
marry
for
a
livelihood
so
i
have
remained
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
and
am
there
still
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
have
done
i
rubbed
my
chin
in
some
embarrassment
at
this
question
needless
to
say
i
was
most
disagreeably
impressed
by
walter
hornby
conduct
and
not
a
little
disposed
to
blame
my
fair
companion
for
giving
an
ear
to
his
secret
disparagement
of
his
cousin
but
i
was
obviously
not
in
a
position
to
pronounce
offhand
upon
the
merits
of
the
case
the
position
appears
to
be
this
i
said
after
a
pause
either
reuben
has
spoken
most
unworthily
and
untruthfully
of
you
or
walter
has
lied
deliberately
about
him
yes
she
agreed
that
is
the
position
but
which
of
the
two
alternatives
appears
to
you
the
more
probable
that
is
very
difficult
to
say
i
answered
there
is
a
certain
kind
of
cad
who
is
much
given
to
boastful
rhodomontade
concerning
his
conquests
we
all
know
him
and
can
generally
spot
him
at
first
sight
but
i
must
say
that
reuben
hornby
did
not
strike
me
as
that
kind
of
man
at
all
then
it
is
clear
that
the
proper
course
for
walter
to
have
adopted
if
he
had
really
heard
such
rumours
was
to
have
had
the
matter
out
with
reuben
instead
of
coming
secretly
to
you
with
whispered
reports
that
is
my
feeling
miss
gibson
but
of
course
i
may
be
quite
wrong
i
gather
that
our
two
young
friends
are
not
inseparable
companions
oh
they
are
very
good
friends
but
you
see
their
interests
and
views
of
life
are
quite
different
reuben
although
an
excellent
worker
in
business
hours
is
a
student
or
perhaps
rather
what
one
would
call
a
scholar
whereas
walter
is
more
a
practical
man
of
affairs
decidedly
and
shrewd
he
is
undoubtedly
very
clever
as
hornby
said
he
takes
photographs
for
instance
i
suggested
yes
but
not
ordinary
amateur
photographs
his
work
is
more
technical
and
quite
excellent
of
its
kind
for
example
he
did
a
most
beautiful
series
of
of
sections
of
metalliferous
rocks
which
he
reproduced
for
publication
by
the
collotype
process
and
even
printed
off
the
plates
himself
i
see
he
must
be
a
very
capable
fellow
he
is
very
she
assented
and
very
keen
on
making
a
position
but
i
am
afraid
he
is
rather
too
fond
of
money
for
its
own
sake
which
is
not
a
pleasant
feature
in
a
young
man
character
is
it
i
agreed
that
it
was
not
excessive
keenness
in
money
affairs
proceeded
miss
gibson
oracularly
is
apt
to
lead
a
young
man
into
bad
ways
oh
you
need
not
smile
jervis
at
my
wise
saws
it
is
perfectly
true
and
you
know
it
the
fact
is
i
sometimes
have
an
uneasy
feeling
that
walter
desire
to
be
rich
inclines
him
to
try
what
looks
like
a
quick
and
easy
method
of
making
money
he
had
a
friend
a
horton
who
is
a
dealer
on
the
stock
exchange
and
who
rather
largely
i
believe
is
the
expression
used
although
it
seems
to
be
nothing
more
than
common
gambling
and
i
have
more
than
once
suspected
walter
of
being
concerned
in
what
horton
calls
little
flutter
that
does
strike
me
as
a
very
proceeding
i
remarked
with
the
impartial
wisdom
of
the
impecunious
and
therefore
untempted
no
she
agreed
it
is
but
your
gambler
always
thinks
he
is
going
to
win
though
you
must
let
me
give
you
the
impression
that
walter
is
a
gambler
but
here
is
my
destination
thank
you
for
escorting
me
so
far
and
i
hope
you
are
beginning
to
feel
less
like
a
stranger
to
the
hornby
family
we
shall
make
our
appearance
at
eight
punctually
she
gave
me
her
hand
with
a
frank
smile
and
tripped
up
the
steps
leading
to
the
street
door
and
when
i
glanced
back
after
crossing
the
road
she
gave
me
a
little
friendly
nod
as
she
turned
to
enter
the
house
chapter
v
the
so
your
net
has
been
sweeping
the
quiet
and
pleasant
waters
of
feminine
conversation
remarked
thorndyke
when
we
met
at
the
dinner
table
and
i
gave
him
an
outline
of
my
afternoon
adventures
yes
i
answered
and
here
is
the
catch
cleaned
and
ready
for
the
consumer
i
laid
on
the
table
two
of
my
notebooks
in
which
i
had
entered
such
facts
as
i
had
been
able
to
extract
from
my
talk
with
miss
gibson
you
made
your
entries
as
soon
as
possible
after
your
return
i
suppose
said
thorndyke
while
the
matter
was
still
fresh
i
wrote
down
my
notes
as
i
sat
on
a
seat
in
kensington
gardens
within
five
minutes
after
leaving
miss
gibson
good
said
thorndyke
and
now
let
us
see
what
you
have
collected
he
glanced
quickly
through
the
entries
in
the
two
books
referring
back
once
or
twice
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
silent
and
abstracted
then
he
laid
the
little
books
down
on
the
table
with
a
satisfied
nod
our
information
then
he
said
amounts
to
this
reuben
is
an
industrious
worker
at
his
business
and
in
his
leisure
a
student
of
ancient
and
medieval
art
possibly
a
babbling
fool
and
a
cad
or
on
the
other
hand
a
maligned
and
man
walter
hornby
is
obviously
a
sneak
and
possibly
a
liar
a
keen
man
of
business
perhaps
a
flutterer
round
the
financial
candle
that
burns
in
throgmorton
street
an
expert
photographer
and
a
competent
worker
of
the
collotype
process
you
have
done
a
very
excellent
day
work
jervis
i
wonder
if
you
see
the
bearing
of
the
facts
that
you
have
collected
i
think
i
see
the
bearing
of
some
of
them
i
answered
at
least
i
have
formed
certain
opinions
then
keep
them
to
yourself
so
that
i
need
not
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
unbosom
myself
of
my
own
views
i
should
be
very
much
surprised
if
you
did
thorndyke
i
replied
and
should
have
none
the
better
opinion
of
you
i
realise
fully
that
your
opinions
and
theories
are
the
property
of
your
client
and
not
to
be
used
for
the
entertainment
of
your
friends
thorndyke
patted
me
on
the
back
playfully
but
he
looked
uncommonly
pleased
and
said
with
evident
sincerity
i
am
really
grateful
to
you
for
saying
that
for
i
have
felt
a
little
awkward
in
being
so
reticent
with
you
who
know
so
much
of
this
case
but
you
are
quite
right
and
i
am
delighted
to
find
you
so
discerning
and
sympathetic
the
least
i
can
do
under
the
circumstances
is
to
uncork
a
bottle
of
pommard
and
drink
the
health
of
so
loyal
and
helpful
a
colleague
ah
praise
the
gods
here
is
polton
like
a
sacrificial
priest
accompanied
by
a
sweet
savour
of
roasted
flesh
rump
steak
i
ween
he
added
sniffing
food
meet
for
the
mighty
shamash
that
pun
was
fortuitous
i
need
not
say
or
a
ravenous
medical
jurist
can
you
explain
to
me
polton
how
it
is
that
your
rump
steak
is
better
than
any
other
steak
is
it
that
you
have
command
of
a
special
brand
of
ox
the
little
man
dry
countenance
wrinkled
with
pleasure
until
it
was
as
full
of
lines
as
a
of
clapham
junction
perhaps
it
is
the
special
treatment
it
gets
sir
he
replied
i
usually
bruise
it
in
the
mortar
before
cooking
without
breaking
up
the
fibre
too
much
and
then
i
heat
up
the
little
cupel
furnace
to
about
c
and
put
the
steak
in
on
a
tripod
thorndyke
laughed
outright
the
cupel
furnace
too
he
exclaimed
well
well
what
base
uses
but
i
do
know
that
it
is
a
base
use
after
all
anyhow
polton
open
a
bottle
of
pommard
and
put
a
couple
of
ten
by
eight
plates
in
your
dark
slides
i
am
expecting
two
ladies
here
this
evening
with
a
document
shall
you
bring
them
upstairs
sir
inquired
polton
with
an
alarmed
expression
i
expect
i
shall
have
to
answered
thorndyke
then
i
shall
just
smarten
the
laboratory
up
a
bit
said
polton
who
evidently
appreciated
the
difference
between
the
masculine
and
feminine
view
as
to
the
proper
appearance
of
working
premises
and
so
miss
gibson
wanted
to
know
our
private
views
on
the
case
said
thorndyke
when
his
voracity
had
become
somewhat
appeased
yes
i
answered
and
then
i
repeated
our
conversation
as
nearly
as
i
could
remember
it
your
answer
was
very
discreet
and
diplomatic
thorndyke
remarked
and
it
was
very
necessary
that
it
should
be
for
it
is
essential
that
we
show
the
backs
of
our
cards
to
scotland
yard
and
if
to
scotland
yard
then
to
the
whole
world
we
know
what
their
trump
card
is
and
can
arrange
our
play
accordingly
so
long
as
we
do
not
show
our
hand
you
speak
of
the
police
as
your
antagonists
i
noticed
that
at
the
this
morning
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
they
accepted
the
position
but
surely
their
business
is
to
discover
the
actual
offender
not
to
fix
the
crime
on
some
particular
person
that
would
seem
to
be
so
replied
thorndyke
but
in
practice
it
is
otherwise
when
the
police
have
made
an
arrest
they
work
for
a
conviction
if
the
man
is
innocent
that
is
his
business
not
theirs
it
is
for
him
to
prove
it
the
system
is
a
pernicious
one
especially
since
the
efficiency
of
a
police
officer
is
in
consequence
apt
to
be
estimated
by
the
number
of
convictions
he
has
secured
and
an
inducement
is
thus
held
out
to
him
to
obtain
a
conviction
if
possible
but
it
is
of
a
piece
with
legislative
procedure
in
general
lawyers
are
not
engaged
in
academic
discussions
or
in
the
pursuit
of
truth
but
each
is
trying
by
hook
or
by
crook
to
make
out
a
particular
case
without
regard
to
its
actual
truth
or
even
to
the
lawyer
own
belief
on
the
subject
that
is
what
produces
so
much
friction
between
lawyers
and
scientific
witnesses
neither
can
understand
the
point
of
view
of
the
other
but
we
must
not
sit
over
the
table
chattering
like
this
it
has
gone
seven
and
polton
will
be
wanting
to
make
this
room
presentable
i
notice
you
do
use
your
office
much
i
remarked
hardly
at
all
excepting
as
a
repository
for
documents
and
stationery
it
is
very
cheerless
to
talk
in
an
office
and
nearly
all
my
business
is
transacted
with
solicitors
and
counsel
who
are
known
to
me
so
there
is
no
need
for
such
formalities
all
right
polton
we
shall
be
ready
for
you
in
five
minutes
the
temple
bell
was
striking
eight
as
at
thorndyke
request
i
threw
open
the
oak
and
even
as
i
did
so
the
sound
of
footsteps
came
up
from
the
stairs
below
i
waited
on
the
landing
for
our
two
visitors
and
led
them
into
the
room
i
am
so
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
hornby
when
i
had
done
the
honours
of
introduction
i
have
heard
so
much
about
you
from
juliet
really
my
dear
aunt
protested
miss
gibson
as
she
caught
my
eye
with
a
look
of
comical
alarm
you
will
give
thorndyke
a
most
erroneous
impression
i
merely
mentioned
that
i
had
intruded
on
him
without
notice
and
had
been
received
with
undeserved
indulgence
and
consideration
you
did
put
it
quite
in
that
way
my
dear
said
hornby
but
i
suppose
it
does
matter
we
are
highly
gratified
by
miss
gibson
favourable
report
of
us
whatever
may
have
been
the
actual
form
of
expression
said
thorndyke
with
a
momentary
glance
at
the
younger
lady
which
covered
her
with
smiling
confusion
and
we
are
deeply
indebted
to
you
for
taking
so
much
trouble
to
help
us
it
is
no
trouble
at
all
but
a
great
pleasure
replied
hornby
and
she
proceeded
to
enlarge
on
the
matter
until
her
remarks
threatened
like
the
rippling
circles
produced
by
a
falling
stone
to
spread
out
into
infinity
in
the
midst
of
this
discourse
thorndyke
placed
chairs
for
the
two
ladies
and
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
fixed
a
stony
gaze
upon
the
small
handbag
that
hung
from
hornby
wrist
is
the
in
your
bag
interrupted
miss
gibson
in
response
to
this
mute
appeal
of
course
it
is
my
dear
juliet
replied
the
elder
lady
you
saw
me
put
it
in
yourself
what
an
odd
girl
you
are
did
you
think
i
should
have
taken
it
out
and
put
it
somewhere
else
not
that
these
handbags
are
really
very
secure
you
know
although
i
daresay
they
are
safer
than
pockets
especially
now
that
it
is
the
fashion
to
have
the
pocket
at
the
back
still
i
have
often
thought
how
easy
it
would
be
for
a
thief
or
a
pickpocket
or
some
other
dreadful
creature
of
that
kind
do
you
know
to
make
a
snatch
and
in
fact
the
thing
has
actually
happened
why
i
knew
a
lady
moggridge
you
know
juliet
no
it
was
moggridge
that
was
another
affair
it
was
dear
me
how
silly
of
me
now
what
was
her
name
ca
you
help
me
juliet
you
must
surely
remember
the
woman
she
used
to
visit
a
good
deal
at
the
i
think
it
was
the
or
else
it
was
those
people
you
know
had
you
better
give
thorndyke
the
interrupted
miss
gibson
why
of
course
juliet
dear
what
else
did
we
come
here
for
with
a
slightly
injured
expression
hornby
opened
the
little
bag
and
commenced
with
the
utmost
deliberation
to
turn
out
its
contents
on
to
the
table
these
included
a
laced
handkerchief
a
purse
a
a
visiting
list
a
packet
of
and
when
she
had
laid
the
article
on
the
table
she
paused
abruptly
and
gazed
into
miss
gibson
face
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
made
a
startling
discovery
i
remember
the
woman
name
she
said
in
an
impressive
voice
it
was
gudge
gudge
the
of
here
miss
gibson
made
an
unceremonious
dive
into
the
open
bag
and
fished
out
a
tiny
parcel
wrapped
in
notepaper
and
secured
with
a
silk
thread
thank
you
said
thorndyke
taking
it
from
her
hand
just
as
hornby
was
reaching
out
to
intercept
it
he
cut
the
thread
and
drew
from
its
wrappings
a
little
book
bound
in
red
cloth
with
the
word
thumbograph
stamped
upon
the
cover
and
was
beginning
to
inspect
it
when
hornby
rose
and
stood
beside
him
that
said
she
as
she
opened
the
book
at
the
first
page
is
the
of
a
miss
colley
she
is
no
connection
of
ours
you
see
it
is
a
little
smeared
she
said
reuben
jogged
her
elbow
but
i
do
think
he
did
at
any
rate
he
assured
me
he
did
not
and
you
know
ah
here
is
one
we
are
looking
for
interrupted
thorndyke
who
had
been
turning
the
leaves
of
the
book
regardless
of
hornby
rambling
comments
a
very
good
impression
too
considering
the
rather
rough
method
of
producing
it
he
reached
out
for
the
reading
lens
that
hung
from
its
nail
above
the
mantelpiece
and
i
could
tell
by
the
eagerness
with
which
he
peered
through
it
at
the
that
he
was
looking
for
something
a
moment
later
i
felt
sure
that
he
had
found
that
something
which
he
had
sought
for
though
he
replaced
the
lens
upon
its
nail
with
a
quiet
and
composed
air
and
made
no
remark
there
was
a
sparkle
of
the
eye
and
a
scarcely
perceptible
flush
of
suppressed
excitement
and
triumph
which
i
had
begun
to
recognise
beneath
the
impassive
mask
that
he
presented
to
the
world
i
shall
ask
you
to
leave
this
little
book
with
me
hornby
he
said
breaking
in
upon
that
lady
inconsequent
babblings
and
as
i
may
possibly
put
it
in
evidence
it
would
be
a
wise
precaution
for
you
and
miss
gibson
to
sign
your
names
as
small
as
possible
on
the
page
which
bears
reuben
that
will
anticipate
any
suggestion
that
the
book
has
been
tampered
with
after
leaving
your
hands
it
would
be
a
great
impertinence
for
anyone
to
make
any
such
suggestion
hornby
began
but
on
thorndyke
placing
his
fountain
pen
in
her
hand
she
wrote
her
signature
in
the
place
indicated
and
handed
the
pen
to
miss
gibson
who
signed
underneath
and
now
said
thorndyke
we
will
take
an
enlarged
photograph
of
this
page
with
the
not
that
it
is
necessary
that
it
should
be
done
now
as
you
are
leaving
the
book
in
my
possession
but
the
photograph
will
be
wanted
and
as
my
man
is
expecting
us
and
has
the
apparatus
ready
we
may
as
well
despatch
the
business
at
once
to
this
both
the
ladies
readily
agreed
being
in
fact
devoured
by
curiosity
with
regard
to
my
colleague
premises
and
we
accordingly
proceeded
to
invade
the
set
of
rooms
on
the
floor
above
over
which
the
ingenious
polton
was
accustomed
to
reign
in
solitary
grandeur
it
was
my
first
visit
to
these
mysterious
regions
and
i
looked
about
me
with
as
much
curiosity
as
did
the
two
ladies
the
first
room
that
we
entered
was
apparently
the
workshop
for
it
contained
a
small
woodworker
bench
a
lathe
a
bench
for
metal
work
and
a
number
of
mechanical
appliances
which
i
was
not
then
able
to
examine
but
i
noticed
that
the
entire
place
presented
to
the
eye
a
most
unworkmanlike
neatness
a
circumstance
that
did
not
escape
thorndyke
observation
for
his
face
relaxed
into
a
grim
smile
as
his
eye
travelled
over
the
bare
benches
and
the
floor
from
this
room
we
entered
the
laboratory
a
large
apartment
one
side
of
which
was
given
up
to
chemical
research
as
was
shown
by
the
shelves
of
reagents
that
covered
the
wall
and
the
flasks
retorts
and
other
apparatus
that
were
arranged
on
the
bench
like
ornaments
on
a
mantelpiece
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
was
a
large
copying
camera
the
front
of
which
carrying
the
lens
was
fixed
and
an
easel
or
copyholder
travelled
on
parallel
guides
towards
or
away
from
it
on
a
long
stand
this
apparatus
thorndyke
proceeded
to
explain
to
our
visitors
while
polton
was
fixing
the
thumbograph
in
a
holder
attached
to
the
easel
you
see
he
said
in
answer
to
a
question
from
miss
gibson
i
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
signatures
cheques
and
disputed
documents
of
various
kinds
now
a
skilled
eye
aided
by
a
can
make
out
very
minute
details
on
a
cheque
or
but
it
is
not
possible
to
lend
one
skilled
eye
to
a
judge
or
juryman
so
that
it
is
often
very
convenient
to
be
able
to
hand
them
a
photograph
in
which
the
magnification
is
already
done
which
they
can
compare
with
the
original
small
things
when
magnified
develop
quite
unexpected
characters
for
instance
you
have
handled
a
good
many
postage
stamps
i
suppose
but
have
you
ever
noticed
the
little
white
spots
in
the
upper
corner
of
a
penny
stamp
or
even
the
difference
in
the
foliage
on
the
two
sides
of
the
wreath
miss
gibson
admitted
that
she
had
not
very
few
people
have
i
suppose
excepting
continued
thorndyke
but
now
just
glance
at
this
and
you
will
find
these
unnoticed
details
forced
upon
your
attention
as
he
spoke
he
handed
her
a
photograph
which
he
had
taken
from
a
drawer
showing
a
penny
stamp
enlarged
to
a
length
of
eight
inches
while
the
ladies
were
marvelling
over
this
production
polton
proceeded
with
his
work
the
thumbograph
having
been
fixed
in
position
the
light
from
a
powerful
incandescent
gas
lamp
fitted
with
a
parabolic
reflector
was
concentrated
on
it
and
the
camera
racked
out
to
its
proper
distance
what
are
those
figures
intended
to
show
inquired
miss
gibson
indicating
the
graduation
on
the
side
of
one
of
the
guides
they
show
the
amount
of
magnification
or
reduction
thorndyke
explained
when
the
pointer
is
opposite
the
photograph
is
the
same
size
as
the
object
photographed
when
it
points
to
say
x
the
photograph
will
be
four
times
the
width
and
length
of
the
object
while
if
it
should
point
to
say
the
photograph
will
be
the
length
of
the
object
it
is
now
you
see
pointing
to
x
so
the
photograph
will
be
eight
times
the
diameter
of
the
original
by
this
time
polton
had
brought
the
camera
to
an
accurate
focus
and
when
we
had
all
been
gratified
by
a
glimpse
of
the
enlarged
image
on
the
focussing
screen
we
withdrew
to
a
smaller
room
which
was
devoted
to
bacteriology
and
microscopical
research
while
the
exposure
was
made
and
the
plate
developed
here
after
an
interval
we
were
joined
by
polton
who
bore
with
infinite
tenderness
the
dripping
negative
on
which
could
be
seen
the
grotesque
transparency
of
a
colossal
this
thorndyke
scrutinised
eagerly
and
having
pronounced
it
satisfactory
informed
hornby
that
the
object
of
her
visit
was
attained
and
thanked
her
for
the
trouble
she
had
taken
i
am
very
glad
we
came
said
miss
gibson
to
me
as
a
little
later
we
walked
slowly
up
mitre
court
in
the
wake
of
hornby
and
thorndyke
and
i
am
glad
to
have
seen
these
wonderful
instruments
too
it
has
made
me
realise
that
something
is
being
done
and
that
thorndyke
really
has
some
object
in
view
it
has
really
encouraged
me
immensely
and
very
properly
so
i
replied
i
too
although
i
really
know
nothing
of
what
my
colleague
is
doing
feel
very
strongly
that
he
would
not
take
all
this
trouble
and
give
up
so
much
valuable
time
if
he
had
not
some
very
definite
purpose
and
some
substantial
reasons
for
taking
a
hopeful
view
thank
you
for
saying
that
she
rejoined
warmly
and
you
will
let
me
have
a
crumb
of
comfort
when
you
can
wo
you
she
looked
in
my
face
so
wistfully
as
she
made
this
appeal
that
i
was
quite
moved
and
indeed
i
am
not
sure
that
my
state
of
mind
at
that
moment
did
not
fully
justify
my
colleague
reticence
towards
me
however
i
fortunately
had
nothing
to
tell
and
so
when
we
emerged
into
fleet
street
to
find
hornby
already
ensconced
in
a
hansom
i
could
only
promise
as
i
grasped
the
hand
that
she
offered
to
me
to
see
her
again
at
the
earliest
opportunity
a
promise
which
my
inner
consciousness
assured
me
would
be
strictly
fulfilled
you
seem
to
be
on
quite
confidential
terms
with
our
fair
friend
thorndyke
remarked
as
we
strolled
back
towards
his
chambers
you
are
an
insinuating
dog
jervis
she
is
very
frank
and
easy
to
get
on
with
i
replied
yes
a
good
girl
and
a
clever
girl
and
comely
to
look
upon
withal
i
suppose
it
would
be
superfluous
for
me
to
suggest
that
you
mind
your
eye
i
should
in
any
case
try
to
cut
out
a
man
who
is
under
a
cloud
i
replied
sulkily
of
course
you
would
hence
the
need
of
attention
to
the
ophthalmic
member
have
you
ascertained
what
miss
gibson
actual
relation
is
to
reuben
hornby
no
i
answered
it
might
be
worth
while
to
find
out
said
thorndyke
and
then
he
relapsed
into
silence
chapter
vi
committed
for
trial
thorndyke
hint
as
to
the
possible
danger
foreshadowed
by
my
growing
intimacy
with
juliet
gibson
had
come
upon
me
as
a
complete
surprise
and
had
indeed
been
resented
by
me
as
somewhat
of
an
impertinence
nevertheless
it
gave
me
considerable
food
for
meditation
and
i
presently
began
to
suspect
that
the
watchful
eyes
of
my
observant
friend
might
have
detected
something
in
my
manner
towards
miss
gibson
suggestive
of
sentiments
that
had
been
unsuspected
by
myself
of
course
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
any
real
feeling
could
have
been
engendered
by
so
ridiculously
brief
an
acquaintance
i
had
only
met
the
girl
three
times
and
even
now
excepting
for
business
relations
was
hardly
entitled
to
more
than
a
bow
of
recognition
but
yet
when
i
considered
the
matter
impartially
and
examined
my
own
consciousness
i
could
not
but
recognise
that
she
had
aroused
in
me
an
interest
which
bore
no
relation
to
the
part
that
she
had
played
in
the
drama
that
was
so
slowly
unfolding
she
was
undeniably
a
very
handsome
girl
and
her
beauty
was
of
a
type
that
specially
appealed
to
me
full
of
dignity
and
character
that
gave
promise
of
a
splendid
middle
age
and
her
personality
was
in
other
ways
not
less
attractive
for
she
was
frank
and
open
sprightly
and
intelligent
and
though
evidently
quite
was
in
nowise
lacking
in
that
womanly
softness
that
so
strongly
engages
a
man
sympathy
in
short
i
realised
that
had
there
been
no
such
person
as
reuben
hornby
i
should
have
viewed
miss
gibson
with
uncommon
interest
but
unfortunately
reuben
hornby
was
a
most
palpable
reality
and
moreover
the
extraordinary
difficulties
of
his
position
entitled
him
to
very
special
consideration
by
any
man
of
honour
it
was
true
that
miss
gibson
had
repudiated
any
feelings
towards
reuben
other
than
those
of
friendship
but
young
ladies
are
not
always
impartial
judges
of
their
own
feelings
and
as
a
man
of
the
world
i
could
not
but
have
my
own
opinion
on
the
matter
which
opinion
i
believed
to
be
shared
by
thorndyke
the
conclusions
to
which
my
cogitations
at
length
brought
me
were
first
that
i
was
an
egotistical
donkey
and
second
that
my
relations
with
miss
gibson
were
of
an
exclusively
business
character
and
must
in
future
be
conducted
on
that
basis
with
the
added
consideration
that
i
was
the
confidential
agent
for
the
time
being
of
reuben
hornby
and
in
honour
bound
to
regard
his
interests
as
paramount
i
am
hoping
said
thorndyke
as
he
held
out
his
hand
for
my
teacup
that
these
profound
reflections
of
yours
are
connected
with
the
hornby
affair
in
which
case
i
should
expect
to
hear
that
the
riddle
is
solved
and
the
mystery
made
plain
why
should
you
expect
that
i
demanded
reddening
somewhat
i
suspect
as
i
met
his
twinkling
eye
there
was
something
rather
disturbing
in
the
dry
quizzical
smile
that
i
encountered
and
the
reflection
that
i
had
been
under
observation
and
i
felt
as
much
embarrassed
as
i
should
suppose
a
might
feel
on
finding
itself
on
the
illuminated
stage
of
a
binocular
microscope
my
dear
fellow
said
thorndyke
you
have
not
spoken
a
word
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
you
have
devoured
your
food
with
the
relentless
regularity
of
a
and
you
have
from
time
to
time
made
the
most
damnable
faces
at
the
though
there
i
wager
the
was
even
with
you
if
i
may
judge
by
the
presentment
that
it
offers
of
my
own
countenance
i
roused
myself
from
my
reverie
with
a
laugh
at
thorndyke
quaint
conceit
and
a
glance
at
the
grotesquely
distorted
reflection
of
my
face
in
the
polished
silver
i
am
afraid
i
been
a
rather
dull
companion
this
morning
i
admitted
apologetically
by
no
means
replied
thorndyke
with
a
grin
on
the
contrary
i
have
found
you
both
amusing
and
instructive
and
i
only
spoke
when
i
had
exhausted
your
potentialities
as
a
silent
entertainer
you
are
pleased
to
be
facetious
at
my
expense
said
i
well
the
expense
was
not
a
very
heavy
one
he
retorted
i
have
been
merely
consuming
a
of
your
mental
activity
hallo
anstey
already
a
peculiar
knock
apparently
delivered
with
the
handle
of
a
on
the
outer
door
was
the
occasion
of
this
exclamation
and
as
thorndyke
sprang
up
and
flung
the
door
open
a
clear
musical
voice
was
borne
in
the
measured
cadences
of
which
proclaimed
at
once
the
trained
orator
hail
learned
brother
it
exclaimed
do
i
disturb
you
untimely
at
your
studies
here
our
visitor
entered
the
room
and
looked
round
critically
is
even
so
he
declared
physiological
chemistry
and
its
practical
applications
appears
to
be
the
subject
a
inquiry
into
the
properties
of
streaky
bacon
and
fried
eggs
do
i
see
another
learned
brother
he
peered
keenly
at
me
through
his
and
i
gazed
at
him
in
some
embarrassment
this
is
my
friend
jervis
of
whom
you
have
heard
me
speak
said
thorndyke
he
is
with
us
in
this
case
you
know
the
echoes
of
your
fame
have
reached
me
sir
said
anstey
holding
out
his
hand
i
am
proud
to
know
you
i
should
have
recognised
you
instantly
from
the
portrait
of
your
lamented
uncle
in
greenwich
hospital
anstey
is
a
wag
you
understand
explained
thorndyke
but
he
has
lucid
intervals
he
have
one
presently
if
we
are
patient
patient
snorted
our
eccentric
visitor
it
is
i
who
need
to
be
patient
when
i
am
dragged
into
police
courts
and
other
sinks
of
iniquity
to
plead
for
common
thieves
and
robbers
like
a
kennington
lane
advocate
you
been
talking
to
lawley
i
see
said
thorndyke
yes
and
he
tells
me
that
we
have
a
leg
to
stand
upon
no
we
got
to
stand
on
our
heads
as
men
of
intellect
should
but
lawley
knows
nothing
about
the
case
he
thinks
he
knows
it
all
said
anstey
most
fools
do
retorted
thorndyke
they
arrive
at
their
knowledge
by
intuition
a
deuced
easy
road
and
cheap
travelling
too
we
reserve
our
defence
i
suppose
you
agree
to
that
i
suppose
so
the
magistrate
is
sure
to
commit
unless
you
have
an
unquestionable
we
shall
put
in
an
but
we
are
not
depending
on
it
then
we
had
better
reserve
our
defence
said
anstey
and
it
is
time
that
we
wended
on
our
pilgrimage
for
we
are
due
at
lawley
at
ten
is
jervis
coming
with
us
yes
you
better
come
said
thorndyke
it
the
adjourned
hearing
of
poor
hornby
case
you
know
there
wo
be
anything
done
on
our
side
but
we
may
be
able
to
glean
some
hint
from
the
prosecution
i
should
like
to
hear
what
takes
place
at
any
rate
i
said
and
we
accordingly
sallied
forth
together
in
the
direction
of
lincoln
inn
on
the
north
side
of
which
lawley
office
was
situated
ah
said
the
solicitor
as
we
entered
i
am
glad
you
come
i
was
getting
anxious
it
does
do
to
be
late
on
these
occasions
you
know
let
me
see
do
you
know
walter
hornby
i
do
think
you
do
he
presented
thorndyke
and
me
to
our
client
cousin
and
as
we
shook
hands
we
viewed
one
another
with
a
good
deal
of
mutual
interest
i
have
heard
about
you
from
my
aunt
said
he
addressing
himself
more
particularly
to
me
she
appears
to
regard
you
as
a
kind
of
legal
maskelyne
and
cooke
i
hope
for
my
cousin
sake
that
you
will
be
able
to
work
the
wonders
that
she
anticipates
poor
old
fellow
he
looks
pretty
bad
does
he
i
glanced
at
reuben
who
was
at
the
moment
talking
to
thorndyke
and
as
he
caught
my
eye
he
held
out
his
hand
with
a
warmth
that
i
found
very
pathetic
he
seemed
to
have
aged
since
i
had
last
seen
him
and
was
pale
and
rather
thinner
but
he
was
composed
in
his
manner
and
seemed
to
me
to
be
taking
his
trouble
very
well
on
the
whole
cab
at
the
door
sir
a
clerk
announced
cab
repeated
lawley
looking
dubiously
at
me
we
want
an
omnibus
jervis
and
i
can
walk
walter
hornby
suggested
we
shall
probably
get
there
as
soon
as
you
and
it
does
matter
if
we
do
yes
that
will
do
said
lawley
you
two
walk
down
together
now
let
us
go
we
trooped
out
on
to
the
pavement
beside
which
a
was
drawn
up
and
as
the
others
were
entering
the
cab
thorndyke
stood
close
beside
me
for
a
moment
do
let
him
pump
you
he
said
in
a
low
voice
without
looking
at
me
then
he
sprang
into
the
cab
and
slammed
the
door
what
an
extraordinary
affair
this
is
walter
hornby
remarked
after
we
had
been
walking
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
a
most
ghastly
business
i
must
confess
that
i
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
how
is
that
i
asked
why
do
you
see
there
are
apparently
only
two
possible
theories
of
the
crime
and
each
of
them
seems
to
be
unthinkable
on
the
one
hand
there
is
reuben
a
man
of
the
most
scrupulous
honour
as
far
as
my
experience
of
him
goes
committing
a
mean
and
sordid
theft
for
which
no
motive
can
be
discovered
for
he
is
not
poor
nor
pecuniarily
embarrassed
nor
in
the
smallest
degree
avaricious
on
the
other
hand
there
is
this
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
experts
is
tantamount
to
the
evidence
of
an
that
he
did
commit
the
theft
it
is
positively
bewildering
do
you
think
so
as
you
put
it
i
answered
the
case
is
extraordinarily
puzzling
but
how
else
would
you
put
it
he
demanded
with
eagerness
i
mean
that
if
reuben
is
the
man
you
believe
him
to
be
the
thing
is
incomprehensible
quite
so
he
agreed
though
he
was
evidently
disappointed
at
my
colourless
answer
he
walked
on
silently
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
said
i
suppose
it
would
not
be
fair
to
ask
if
you
see
any
way
out
of
the
difficulty
we
are
all
naturally
anxious
about
the
upshot
of
the
affair
seeing
what
poor
old
reuben
position
is
naturally
but
the
fact
is
that
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
and
as
to
thorndyke
you
might
as
well
a
whitstable
native
as
put
questions
to
him
yes
so
i
gathered
from
juliet
but
i
thought
you
might
have
gleaned
some
notion
of
the
line
of
defence
from
your
work
in
the
laboratory
the
microscopical
and
photographic
work
i
mean
i
was
never
in
the
laboratory
until
last
night
when
thorndyke
took
me
there
with
your
aunt
and
miss
gibson
the
work
there
is
done
by
the
laboratory
assistant
and
his
knowledge
of
the
case
i
should
say
is
about
as
great
as
a
knowledge
of
the
books
that
he
is
helping
to
produce
no
thorndyke
is
a
man
who
plays
a
game
and
no
one
knows
what
cards
he
holds
until
he
lays
them
on
the
table
my
companion
considered
this
statement
in
silence
while
i
congratulated
myself
on
having
parried
with
great
adroitness
a
rather
inconvenient
question
but
the
time
was
not
far
distant
when
i
should
have
occasion
to
reproach
myself
bitterly
for
having
been
so
explicit
and
emphatic
my
uncle
condition
walter
resumed
after
a
pause
is
a
pretty
miserable
one
at
present
with
this
horrible
affair
added
to
his
own
personal
worries
has
he
any
special
trouble
besides
this
then
i
asked
why
have
you
heard
i
thought
you
knew
about
it
or
i
have
spoken
not
that
it
is
in
any
way
a
secret
seeing
that
it
is
public
property
in
the
city
the
fact
is
that
his
financial
affairs
are
a
little
entangled
just
now
indeed
i
exclaimed
considerably
startled
by
this
new
development
yes
things
have
taken
a
rather
awkward
turn
though
i
think
he
will
pull
through
all
right
it
is
the
usual
thing
you
know
investments
or
perhaps
one
should
say
speculations
he
appears
to
have
sunk
a
lot
of
capital
in
mines
thought
he
was
the
know
not
unnaturally
but
it
seems
he
was
after
all
and
the
things
have
gone
wrong
leaving
him
with
a
deal
more
money
than
he
can
afford
locked
up
and
the
possibility
of
a
dead
loss
if
they
do
revive
then
there
are
these
infernal
diamonds
he
is
not
morally
responsible
we
know
but
it
is
a
question
if
he
is
not
legally
responsible
though
the
lawyers
think
he
is
not
anyhow
there
is
going
to
be
a
meeting
of
the
creditors
and
what
do
you
think
they
will
do
oh
they
will
most
probably
let
him
go
on
for
the
present
but
of
course
if
he
is
made
accountable
for
the
diamonds
there
will
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
through
the
hoop
as
the
sporting
financier
expresses
it
the
diamonds
were
of
considerable
value
then
from
to
thirty
thousand
pounds
worth
vanished
with
that
parcel
i
whistled
this
was
a
much
bigger
affair
than
i
had
imagined
and
i
was
wondering
if
thorndyke
had
realised
the
magnitude
of
the
robbery
when
we
arrived
at
the
police
court
i
suppose
our
friends
have
gone
inside
said
walter
they
must
have
got
here
before
us
this
supposition
was
confirmed
by
a
constable
of
whom
we
made
inquiry
and
who
directed
us
to
the
entrance
to
the
court
passing
down
a
passage
and
elbowing
our
way
through
the
throng
of
idlers
we
made
for
the
solicitor
box
where
we
had
barely
taken
our
seats
when
the
case
was
called
unspeakably
dreary
and
depressing
were
the
brief
proceedings
that
followed
and
dreadfully
suggestive
of
the
helplessness
of
even
an
innocent
man
on
whom
the
law
has
laid
its
hand
and
in
whose
behalf
its
inexorable
machinery
has
been
set
in
motion
the
presiding
magistrate
emotionless
and
dry
dipped
his
pen
while
reuben
who
had
surrendered
to
his
bail
was
placed
in
the
dock
and
the
charge
read
over
to
him
the
counsel
representing
the
police
gave
an
abstract
of
the
case
with
the
air
of
a
describing
an
eligible
property
then
when
the
plea
of
not
guilty
had
been
entered
the
witnesses
were
called
there
were
only
two
and
when
the
name
of
the
first
john
hornby
was
called
i
glanced
towards
the
with
no
little
curiosity
i
had
not
hitherto
met
hornby
and
as
he
now
entered
the
box
i
saw
an
elderly
man
tall
florid
and
but
strained
and
wild
in
expression
and
displaying
his
uncontrollable
agitation
by
continual
nervous
movements
which
contrasted
curiously
with
the
composed
demeanour
of
the
accused
man
nevertheless
he
gave
his
evidence
in
a
perfectly
connected
manner
recounting
the
events
connected
with
the
discovery
of
the
crime
in
much
the
same
words
as
i
had
heard
lawley
use
though
indeed
he
was
a
good
deal
more
emphatic
than
that
gentleman
had
been
in
regard
to
the
excellent
character
borne
by
the
prisoner
after
him
came
singleton
of
the
department
at
scotland
yard
to
whose
evidence
i
listened
with
close
attention
he
produced
the
paper
which
bore
the
in
blood
which
had
previously
been
identified
by
hornby
and
a
paper
bearing
the
print
taken
by
himself
of
the
prisoner
left
thumb
these
two
he
stated
were
identical
in
every
respect
and
you
are
of
opinion
that
the
mark
on
the
paper
that
was
found
in
hornby
safe
was
made
by
the
prisoner
left
thumb
the
magistrate
asked
in
dry
and
tones
i
am
certain
of
it
you
are
of
opinion
that
no
mistake
is
possible
no
mistake
is
possible
your
worship
it
is
a
certainty
the
magistrate
looked
at
anstey
inquiringly
whereupon
the
barrister
rose
we
reserve
our
defence
your
worship
the
magistrate
then
in
the
same
placid
manner
committed
the
prisoner
for
trial
at
the
central
criminal
court
refusing
to
accept
bail
for
his
appearance
and
as
reuben
was
led
forth
from
the
dock
the
next
case
was
called
by
special
favour
of
the
authorities
reuben
was
to
be
allowed
to
make
his
journey
to
holloway
in
a
cab
thus
escaping
the
horrors
of
the
filthy
and
verminous
prison
van
and
while
this
was
being
procured
his
friends
were
permitted
to
wish
him
farewell
this
is
a
hard
experience
hornby
said
thorndyke
when
we
three
were
for
a
few
moments
left
apart
from
the
others
and
as
he
spoke
the
warmth
of
a
really
sympathetic
nature
broke
through
his
habitual
impassivity
but
be
of
good
cheer
i
have
convinced
myself
of
your
innocence
and
have
good
hopes
of
convincing
the
world
though
this
is
for
your
private
ear
you
understand
to
be
mentioned
to
no
one
reuben
wrung
the
hand
of
this
friend
in
need
but
was
unable
for
the
moment
to
speak
and
as
his
was
evidently
strained
to
the
breaking
point
thorndyke
with
a
man
natural
instinct
wished
him
a
hasty
and
passing
his
hand
through
my
arm
turned
away
i
wish
it
had
been
possible
to
save
the
poor
fellow
from
this
delay
and
especially
from
the
degradation
of
being
locked
up
in
a
jail
he
exclaimed
regretfully
as
we
walked
down
the
street
there
is
surely
no
degradation
in
being
merely
accused
of
a
crime
i
answered
without
much
conviction
however
it
may
happen
to
the
best
of
us
and
he
is
still
an
innocent
man
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
that
my
dear
jervis
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
to
be
mere
casuistry
he
rejoined
the
law
professes
to
regard
the
unconvicted
man
as
innocent
but
how
does
it
treat
him
you
heard
how
the
magistrate
addressed
our
friend
outside
the
court
he
would
have
called
him
hornby
you
know
what
will
happen
to
reuben
at
holloway
he
will
be
ordered
about
by
warders
will
have
a
number
label
fastened
on
to
his
coat
he
will
be
locked
in
a
cell
with
a
in
the
door
through
which
any
passing
stranger
may
watch
him
his
food
will
be
handed
to
him
in
a
tin
pan
with
a
tin
knife
and
spoon
and
he
will
be
periodically
called
out
of
his
cell
and
driven
round
the
exercise
yard
with
a
mob
composed
for
the
most
part
of
the
sweepings
of
the
london
slums
if
he
is
acquitted
he
will
be
turned
loose
without
a
suggestion
of
compensation
or
apology
for
these
indignities
or
the
losses
he
may
have
sustained
through
his
detention
still
i
suppose
these
evils
are
unavoidable
i
said
that
may
or
may
not
be
he
retorted
my
point
is
that
the
presumption
of
innocence
is
a
pure
fiction
that
the
treatment
of
an
accused
man
from
the
moment
of
his
arrest
is
that
of
a
criminal
however
he
concluded
hailing
a
passing
hansom
this
discussion
must
be
adjourned
or
i
shall
be
late
at
the
hospital
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
shall
get
some
lunch
and
then
call
on
miss
gibson
to
let
her
know
the
real
position
yes
that
will
be
kind
i
think
baldly
stated
the
news
may
seem
rather
alarming
i
was
tempted
to
thrash
the
case
out
in
the
police
court
but
it
would
not
have
been
safe
he
would
almost
certainly
have
been
committed
for
trial
after
all
and
then
we
should
have
shown
our
hand
to
the
prosecution
he
sprang
into
the
hansom
and
was
speedily
swallowed
up
in
the
traffic
while
i
turned
back
towards
the
police
court
to
make
certain
inquiries
concerning
the
regulations
as
to
visitors
at
holloway
prison
at
the
door
i
met
the
friendly
inspector
from
scotland
yard
who
gave
me
the
necessary
information
whereupon
with
a
certain
homely
little
french
restaurant
in
my
mind
i
bent
my
steps
in
the
direction
of
soho
chapter
vii
shoals
and
quicksands
when
i
arrived
at
endsley
gardens
miss
gibson
was
at
home
and
to
my
unspeakable
relief
hornby
was
not
my
veneration
for
that
moral
qualities
was
excessive
but
her
conversation
drove
me
to
the
verge
of
insanity
an
insanity
not
entirely
free
from
homicidal
tendencies
it
is
good
of
you
to
come
though
i
thought
you
would
miss
gibson
said
impulsively
as
we
shook
hands
you
have
been
so
sympathetic
and
human
both
you
and
thorndyke
so
free
from
professional
stiffness
my
aunt
went
off
to
see
lawley
directly
we
got
walter
telegram
i
am
sorry
for
her
i
said
and
was
on
the
point
of
adding
and
him
but
fortunately
a
glimmer
of
sense
restrained
me
she
will
find
him
dry
enough
yes
i
dislike
him
extremely
do
you
know
that
he
had
the
impudence
to
advise
reuben
to
plead
he
told
us
he
had
done
so
and
got
a
snubbing
from
thorndyke
for
his
pains
i
am
so
glad
exclaimed
miss
gibson
viciously
but
tell
me
what
has
happened
walter
simply
said
to
higher
court
which
we
agreed
was
to
mean
for
trial
has
the
defence
failed
and
where
is
reuben
the
defence
is
reserved
thorndyke
considered
it
almost
certain
that
the
case
would
be
sent
for
trial
and
that
being
so
decided
that
it
was
essential
to
keep
the
prosecution
in
the
dark
as
to
the
line
of
defence
you
see
if
the
police
knew
what
the
defence
was
to
be
they
could
revise
their
own
plans
accordingly
i
see
that
said
she
dejectedly
but
i
am
dreadfully
disappointed
i
had
hoped
that
thorndyke
would
get
the
case
dismissed
what
has
happened
to
reuben
this
was
the
question
that
i
had
dreaded
and
now
that
i
had
to
answer
it
i
cleared
my
throat
and
bent
my
gaze
nervously
on
the
floor
the
magistrate
refused
bail
i
said
after
an
uncomfortable
pause
well
consequently
reuben
has
been
er
detained
in
custody
you
do
mean
to
say
that
they
have
sent
him
to
prison
she
exclaimed
breathlessly
not
as
a
convicted
prisoner
you
know
he
is
merely
detained
pending
his
trial
but
in
prison
yes
i
was
forced
to
admit
in
holloway
prison
she
looked
me
stonily
in
the
face
for
some
seconds
pale
and
but
silent
then
with
a
sudden
catch
in
her
breath
she
turned
away
and
grasping
the
edge
of
the
laid
her
head
upon
her
arm
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
sobbing
now
i
am
not
in
general
an
emotional
man
nor
even
especially
impulsive
but
neither
am
i
a
stock
or
a
stone
or
an
effigy
of
wood
which
i
most
surely
must
have
been
if
i
could
have
looked
without
being
deeply
moved
on
the
grief
so
natural
and
unselfish
of
this
strong
brave
woman
in
effect
i
moved
to
her
side
and
gently
taking
in
mine
the
hand
that
hung
down
murmured
some
incoherent
words
of
consolation
in
a
particularly
husky
voice
presently
she
recovered
herself
somewhat
and
softly
withdrew
her
hand
as
she
turned
towards
me
drying
her
eyes
you
must
forgive
me
for
distressing
you
as
i
fear
i
have
she
said
for
you
are
so
kind
and
i
feel
that
you
are
really
my
friend
and
reuben
i
am
indeed
dear
miss
gibson
i
replied
and
so
i
assure
you
is
my
colleague
i
am
sure
of
it
she
rejoined
but
i
was
so
unprepared
for
this
i
can
not
say
why
excepting
that
i
trusted
so
entirely
in
thorndyke
and
it
is
so
horrible
and
above
all
so
dreadfully
suggestive
of
what
may
happen
up
to
now
the
whole
thing
has
seemed
like
a
nightmare
terrifying
but
yet
unreal
but
now
that
he
is
actually
in
prison
it
has
suddenly
become
a
dreadful
reality
and
i
am
overwhelmed
with
terror
oh
poor
boy
what
will
become
of
him
for
pity
sake
jervis
tell
me
what
is
going
to
happen
what
could
i
do
i
had
heard
thorndyke
words
of
encouragement
to
reuben
and
knew
my
colleague
well
enough
to
feel
sure
that
he
meant
all
he
had
said
doubtless
my
proper
course
would
have
been
to
keep
my
own
counsel
and
put
miss
gibson
off
with
cautious
ambiguities
but
i
could
not
she
was
worthy
of
more
confidence
than
that
you
must
not
be
unduly
alarmed
about
the
future
i
said
i
have
it
from
thorndyke
that
he
is
convinced
of
reuben
innocence
and
is
hopeful
of
being
able
to
make
it
clear
to
the
world
but
i
did
not
have
this
to
repeat
i
added
with
a
slight
qualm
of
conscience
i
know
she
said
softly
and
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
and
as
to
this
present
misfortune
i
continued
you
must
not
let
it
distress
you
too
much
try
to
think
of
it
as
of
a
surgical
operation
which
is
a
dreadful
thing
in
itself
but
is
accepted
in
lieu
of
something
which
is
immeasurably
more
dreadful
i
will
try
to
do
as
you
tell
me
she
answered
meekly
but
it
is
so
shocking
to
think
of
a
cultivated
gentleman
like
reuben
herded
with
common
thieves
and
murderers
and
locked
in
a
cage
like
some
wild
animal
think
of
the
ignominy
and
degradation
there
is
no
ignominy
in
being
wrongfully
accused
i
said
a
little
guiltily
i
must
own
for
thorndyke
words
came
back
to
me
with
all
their
force
but
regardless
of
this
i
went
on
an
acquittal
will
restore
him
to
his
position
with
an
unstained
character
and
nothing
but
the
recollection
of
a
passing
inconvenience
to
look
back
upon
she
gave
her
eyes
a
final
wipe
and
resolutely
put
away
her
handkerchief
you
have
given
me
back
my
courage
she
said
and
chased
away
my
terror
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
feel
your
goodness
nor
have
i
any
to
make
except
the
promise
to
be
brave
and
patient
henceforth
and
trust
in
you
entirely
she
said
this
with
such
a
grateful
smile
and
looked
withal
so
sweet
and
womanly
that
i
was
seized
with
an
overpowering
impulse
to
take
her
in
my
arms
instead
of
this
i
said
with
conscious
feebleness
i
am
more
than
thankful
to
have
been
able
to
give
you
any
encouragement
which
you
must
remember
comes
from
me
after
all
it
is
to
thorndyke
that
we
all
look
for
ultimate
deliverance
i
know
but
it
is
you
who
came
to
comfort
me
in
my
trouble
so
you
see
the
honours
are
divided
and
not
divided
quite
equally
i
fear
for
women
are
unreasoning
creatures
as
no
doubt
your
experience
has
informed
you
i
think
i
hear
my
aunt
voice
so
you
had
better
escape
before
your
retreat
is
cut
off
but
before
you
go
you
must
tell
me
how
and
when
i
can
see
reuben
i
want
to
see
him
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
poor
fellow
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
feel
that
his
friends
have
forgotten
him
even
for
a
single
instant
you
can
see
him
if
you
like
i
said
and
casting
my
good
resolutions
to
the
winds
i
added
i
shall
be
going
to
see
him
myself
and
perhaps
thorndyke
will
go
would
you
let
me
call
at
the
temple
and
go
with
you
should
i
be
much
in
the
way
it
is
rather
an
alarming
thing
to
go
to
a
prison
alone
it
is
not
to
be
thought
of
i
answered
if
you
will
call
at
the
temple
it
is
on
the
way
we
can
drive
to
holloway
together
i
suppose
you
are
resolved
to
go
it
will
be
rather
unpleasant
as
you
are
probably
aware
i
am
quite
resolved
what
time
shall
i
come
to
the
temple
about
two
if
that
will
suit
you
very
well
i
will
be
punctual
and
now
you
must
go
or
you
will
be
caught
she
pushed
me
gently
towards
the
door
and
holding
out
her
hand
said
i
have
thanked
you
half
enough
and
i
never
can
she
was
gone
and
i
stood
alone
in
the
street
up
which
yellowish
wreaths
of
fog
were
beginning
to
roll
it
had
been
quite
clear
and
bright
when
i
entered
the
house
but
now
the
sky
was
settling
down
into
a
colourless
grey
the
light
was
failing
and
the
houses
dwindling
into
dim
unreal
shapes
that
vanished
at
half
their
height
nevertheless
i
stepped
out
briskly
and
strode
along
at
a
good
pace
as
a
young
man
is
apt
to
do
when
his
mind
is
in
somewhat
of
a
ferment
in
truth
i
had
a
good
deal
to
occupy
my
thoughts
and
as
will
often
happen
both
to
young
men
and
old
those
matters
that
bore
most
directly
upon
my
own
life
and
prospects
were
the
first
to
receive
attention
what
sort
of
relations
were
growing
up
between
juliet
gibson
and
me
and
what
was
my
position
as
to
hers
it
seemed
plain
enough
she
was
wrapped
up
in
reuben
hornby
and
i
was
her
very
good
friend
because
i
was
his
but
for
myself
there
was
no
disguising
the
fact
that
i
was
beginning
to
take
an
interest
in
her
that
boded
ill
for
my
peace
of
mind
never
had
i
met
a
woman
who
so
entirely
realised
my
conception
of
what
a
woman
should
be
nor
one
who
exercised
so
great
a
charm
over
me
her
strength
and
dignity
her
softness
and
dependency
to
say
nothing
of
her
beauty
fitted
her
with
the
necessary
weapons
for
my
complete
and
utter
subjugation
and
utterly
subjugated
i
was
there
was
no
use
in
denying
the
fact
even
though
i
realised
already
that
the
time
would
presently
come
when
she
would
want
me
no
more
and
there
would
remain
no
remedy
for
me
but
to
go
away
and
try
to
forget
her
but
was
i
acting
as
a
man
of
honour
to
this
i
felt
i
could
fairly
answer
yes
for
i
was
but
doing
my
duty
and
could
hardly
act
differently
if
i
wished
to
besides
i
was
jeopardising
no
happiness
but
my
own
and
a
man
may
do
as
he
pleases
with
his
own
happiness
no
even
thorndyke
could
not
accuse
me
of
dishonourable
conduct
presently
my
thoughts
took
a
fresh
turn
and
i
began
to
reflect
upon
what
i
had
heard
concerning
hornby
here
was
a
startling
development
indeed
and
i
wondered
what
difference
it
would
make
in
hypothesis
of
the
crime
what
his
theory
was
i
had
never
been
able
to
guess
but
as
i
walked
along
through
the
thickening
fog
i
tried
to
fit
this
new
fact
into
our
collection
of
data
and
determine
its
bearings
and
significance
in
this
for
a
time
i
failed
utterly
the
red
filled
my
field
of
vision
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
to
me
as
to
everyone
else
but
thorndyke
this
fact
was
final
and
pointed
to
a
conclusion
that
was
unanswerable
but
as
i
turned
the
story
of
the
crime
over
and
over
there
came
to
me
presently
an
idea
that
set
in
motion
a
new
and
very
startling
train
of
thought
could
hornby
himself
be
the
thief
his
failure
appeared
sudden
to
the
outside
world
but
he
must
have
seen
difficulties
coming
there
indeed
was
the
on
the
leaf
which
he
had
torn
from
his
yes
but
who
had
seen
him
tear
it
off
no
one
the
fact
rested
on
his
bare
statement
but
the
well
it
was
possible
though
unlikely
still
possible
that
the
mark
might
have
been
made
accidentally
on
some
previous
occasion
and
forgotten
by
reuben
or
even
unnoticed
hornby
had
seen
the
thumbograph
in
fact
his
own
mark
was
in
it
and
so
would
have
had
his
attention
directed
to
the
importance
of
in
identification
he
might
have
kept
the
marked
paper
for
future
use
and
on
the
occasion
of
the
robbery
pencilled
a
dated
inscription
on
it
and
slipped
it
into
the
safe
as
a
sure
means
of
diverting
suspicion
all
this
was
improbable
in
the
highest
degree
but
then
so
was
every
other
explanation
of
the
crime
and
as
to
the
unspeakable
baseness
of
the
deed
what
action
is
too
base
for
a
gambler
in
difficulties
i
was
so
much
excited
and
elated
by
my
own
ingenuity
in
having
formed
an
intelligible
and
practicable
theory
of
the
crime
that
i
was
now
impatient
to
reach
home
that
i
might
impart
my
news
to
thorndyke
and
see
how
they
affected
him
but
as
i
approached
the
centre
of
the
town
the
fog
grew
so
dense
that
all
my
attention
was
needed
to
enable
me
to
thread
my
way
safely
through
the
traffic
while
the
strange
deceptive
aspect
that
it
lent
to
familiar
objects
and
the
obliteration
of
landmarks
made
my
progress
so
slow
that
it
was
already
past
six
when
i
felt
my
way
down
middle
temple
lane
and
crept
through
crown
office
row
towards
my
colleague
chambers
on
the
doorstep
i
found
polton
peering
with
anxious
face
into
the
blank
expanse
of
yellow
vapour
the
doctor
late
sir
said
he
detained
by
the
fog
i
expect
it
must
be
pretty
thick
in
the
borough
i
may
mention
that
to
polton
thorndyke
was
the
doctor
other
inferior
creatures
there
were
indeed
to
whom
the
title
of
doctor
in
a
way
appertained
but
they
were
of
no
account
in
polton
eyes
surnames
were
good
enough
for
them
yes
it
must
be
i
replied
judging
by
the
condition
of
the
strand
i
entered
and
ascended
the
stairs
glad
enough
of
the
prospect
of
a
warm
and
room
after
my
comfortless
groping
in
the
murky
streets
and
polton
with
a
final
glance
up
and
down
the
walk
reluctantly
followed
you
would
like
some
tea
sir
i
expect
said
he
as
he
let
me
in
though
i
had
a
key
of
my
own
now
i
thought
i
should
and
he
accordingly
set
about
the
preparations
in
his
deft
methodical
way
but
with
an
air
of
abstraction
that
was
unusual
with
him
the
doctor
said
he
should
be
home
by
five
he
remarked
as
he
laid
the
on
the
tray
then
he
is
a
defaulter
i
answered
we
shall
have
to
water
his
tea
a
wonderful
punctual
man
sir
is
the
doctor
pursued
polton
keeps
his
time
to
the
minute
as
a
rule
he
does
you
ca
keep
your
time
to
a
minute
in
a
particular
i
said
a
little
impatiently
for
i
wished
to
be
alone
that
i
might
think
over
matters
and
polton
nervous
flutterings
irritated
me
somewhat
he
was
almost
as
bad
as
a
female
housekeeper
the
little
man
evidently
perceived
my
state
of
mind
for
he
stole
away
silently
leaving
me
rather
penitent
and
ashamed
and
as
i
presently
discovered
on
looking
out
of
the
window
resumed
his
vigil
on
the
doorstep
from
this
coign
of
vantage
he
returned
after
a
time
to
take
away
the
and
thereafter
though
it
was
now
dark
as
well
as
foggy
i
could
hear
him
softly
flitting
up
and
down
the
stairs
with
a
gloomy
stealthiness
that
at
length
reduced
me
to
a
condition
as
nervously
apprehensive
as
his
own
chapter
viii
a
suspicious
accident
the
temple
clock
had
announced
in
soft
and
confidential
tones
that
it
was
a
quarter
to
seven
in
which
statement
it
was
stoutly
supported
by
its
colleague
on
our
mantelpiece
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
thorndyke
it
was
really
a
little
strange
for
he
was
the
soul
of
punctuality
and
moreover
his
engagements
were
of
such
a
kind
as
rendered
punctuality
possible
i
was
burning
with
impatience
to
impart
my
news
to
him
and
this
fact
together
with
the
ghostly
proceedings
of
polton
worked
me
up
to
a
state
of
nervous
tension
that
rendered
either
rest
or
thought
equally
impossible
i
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
lamp
below
glaring
redly
through
the
fog
and
then
opening
the
door
went
out
on
to
the
landing
to
listen
at
this
moment
polton
made
a
silent
appearance
on
the
stairs
leading
from
the
laboratory
giving
me
quite
a
start
and
i
was
about
to
retire
into
the
room
when
my
ear
caught
the
tinkle
of
a
hansom
approaching
from
paper
buildings
the
vehicle
drew
nearer
and
at
length
stopped
opposite
the
house
on
which
polton
slid
down
the
stairs
with
the
agility
of
a
harlequin
a
few
moments
later
i
heard
his
voice
ascending
from
the
hall
i
do
hope
sir
you
not
much
hurt
i
ran
down
the
stairs
and
met
thorndyke
coming
up
slowly
with
his
right
hand
on
polton
shoulder
his
clothes
were
muddy
his
left
arm
was
in
a
sling
and
a
black
handkerchief
under
his
hat
evidently
concealed
a
bandage
i
am
not
really
hurt
at
all
thorndyke
replied
cheerily
though
very
disreputable
to
look
at
just
came
a
cropper
in
the
mud
jervis
he
added
as
he
noted
my
dismayed
expression
dinner
and
a
are
what
i
chiefly
need
nevertheless
he
looked
very
pale
and
shaken
when
he
came
into
the
light
on
the
landing
and
he
sank
into
his
in
the
limp
manner
of
a
man
either
very
weak
or
very
fatigued
how
did
it
happen
i
asked
when
polton
had
crept
away
on
to
make
ready
for
dinner
thorndyke
looked
round
to
make
sure
that
his
henchman
had
departed
and
said
a
queer
affair
jervis
a
very
odd
affair
indeed
i
was
coming
up
from
the
borough
picking
my
way
mighty
carefully
across
the
road
on
account
of
the
greasy
slippery
mud
and
had
just
reached
the
foot
of
london
bridge
when
i
heard
a
heavy
lorry
coming
down
the
slope
a
good
deal
too
fast
considering
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
more
than
a
dozen
yards
ahead
and
i
stopped
on
the
kerb
to
see
it
safely
past
just
as
the
horses
emerged
from
the
fog
a
man
came
up
behind
and
lurched
violently
against
me
and
strangely
enough
at
the
same
moment
passed
his
foot
in
front
of
mine
of
course
i
went
sprawling
into
the
road
right
in
front
of
the
lorry
the
horses
came
stamping
and
sliding
straight
on
to
me
and
before
i
could
wriggle
out
of
the
way
the
hoof
of
one
of
them
smashed
in
my
hat
that
was
a
new
one
that
i
came
home
in
and
me
then
the
near
wheel
struck
my
head
making
a
dirty
little
scalp
wound
and
pinned
down
my
sleeve
so
that
i
could
pull
away
my
arm
which
is
consequently
barked
all
the
way
down
it
was
a
mighty
near
thing
jervis
another
inch
or
two
and
i
should
have
been
rolled
out
as
flat
as
a
starfish
what
became
of
the
man
i
asked
wishing
i
could
have
had
a
brief
interview
with
him
lost
to
sight
though
to
memory
dear
he
was
off
like
a
lamplighter
an
alcoholic
picked
me
up
and
escorted
me
back
to
the
hospital
it
must
have
been
a
touching
spectacle
he
added
with
a
dry
smile
at
the
recollection
and
i
suppose
they
kept
you
there
for
a
time
to
recover
yes
i
went
into
dry
dock
in
the
room
and
then
old
langdale
insisted
on
my
lying
down
for
an
hour
or
so
in
case
any
symptoms
of
concussion
should
appear
but
i
was
only
a
trifle
shaken
and
confused
still
it
was
a
queer
affair
you
mean
the
man
pushing
you
down
in
that
way
yes
i
ca
make
out
how
his
foot
got
in
front
of
mine
you
do
think
it
was
intentional
surely
i
said
no
of
course
not
he
replied
but
without
much
conviction
as
it
seemed
to
me
and
i
was
about
to
pursue
the
matter
when
polton
reappeared
and
my
friend
abruptly
changed
the
subject
after
dinner
i
recounted
my
conversation
with
walter
hornby
watching
my
colleague
face
with
some
eagerness
to
see
what
effect
this
new
information
would
produce
on
him
the
result
was
on
the
whole
disappointing
he
was
interested
keenly
interested
but
showed
no
symptoms
of
excitement
so
john
hornby
has
been
plunging
in
mines
eh
he
said
when
i
had
finished
he
ought
to
know
better
at
his
age
did
you
learn
how
long
he
had
been
in
difficulties
no
but
it
can
hardly
have
been
quite
sudden
and
unforeseen
i
should
think
not
thorndyke
agreed
a
sudden
slump
often
proves
disastrous
to
the
regular
stock
exchange
gambler
who
is
paying
differences
on
large
quantities
of
stock
but
it
looks
as
if
hornby
had
actually
bought
and
paid
for
these
mines
treating
them
as
investments
rather
than
speculations
in
which
case
the
depreciation
would
not
have
affected
him
in
the
same
way
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
for
certain
it
might
have
a
considerable
bearing
on
the
present
case
might
it
not
undoubtedly
said
thorndyke
it
might
bear
on
the
case
in
more
ways
than
one
but
you
have
some
special
point
in
your
mind
i
think
yes
i
was
thinking
that
if
these
embarrassments
had
been
growing
up
gradually
for
some
time
they
might
have
already
assumed
an
acute
form
at
the
time
of
the
robbery
that
is
well
considered
said
my
colleague
but
what
is
the
special
bearing
on
the
case
supposing
it
was
so
on
the
supposition
i
replied
that
hornby
was
in
actual
pecuniary
difficulties
at
the
date
of
the
robbery
it
seems
to
me
possible
to
construct
a
hypothesis
as
to
the
identity
of
the
robber
i
should
like
to
hear
that
hypothesis
stated
said
thorndyke
rousing
himself
and
regarding
me
with
lively
interest
it
is
a
highly
improbable
one
i
began
with
some
natural
shyness
at
the
idea
of
airing
my
wits
before
this
master
of
inductive
method
in
fact
it
is
almost
fantastic
never
mind
that
said
he
a
sound
thinker
gives
equal
consideration
to
the
probable
and
the
improbable
thus
encouraged
i
proceeded
to
set
forth
the
theory
of
the
crime
as
it
had
occurred
to
me
on
my
way
home
in
the
fog
and
i
was
gratified
to
observe
the
close
attention
with
which
thorndyke
listened
and
his
little
nods
of
approval
at
each
point
that
i
made
when
i
had
finished
he
remained
silent
for
some
time
looking
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
and
evidently
considering
how
my
theory
and
the
new
facts
on
which
it
was
based
would
fit
in
with
the
rest
of
the
data
at
length
he
spoke
without
however
removing
his
eyes
from
the
red
embers
this
theory
of
yours
jervis
does
great
credit
to
your
ingenuity
we
may
disregard
the
improbability
seeing
that
the
alternative
theories
are
almost
equally
improbable
and
the
fact
that
emerges
and
that
gratifies
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
is
that
you
are
gifted
with
enough
scientific
imagination
to
construct
a
possible
train
of
events
indeed
the
improbability
combined
of
course
with
possibility
really
adds
to
the
achievement
for
the
dullest
mind
can
perceive
the
obvious
as
for
instance
the
importance
of
a
you
have
really
done
a
great
thing
and
i
congratulate
you
for
you
have
emancipated
yourself
at
least
to
some
extent
from
the
great
obsession
which
has
possessed
the
legal
mind
ever
since
galton
published
his
monograph
in
that
work
i
remember
he
states
that
a
affords
evidence
requiring
no
corroboration
a
most
dangerous
and
misleading
statement
which
has
been
fastened
upon
eagerly
by
the
police
who
have
naturally
been
delighted
at
obtaining
a
sort
of
magic
touchstone
by
which
they
are
saved
the
labour
of
investigation
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
single
fact
that
evidence
requiring
no
corroboration
as
well
might
one
expect
to
make
a
syllogism
with
a
single
premise
i
suppose
they
would
hardly
go
so
far
as
that
i
said
laughing
no
he
admitted
but
the
kind
of
syllogism
that
they
do
make
is
this
crime
was
committed
by
the
person
who
made
this
john
smith
is
the
person
who
made
the
the
crime
was
committed
by
john
smith
well
that
is
a
perfectly
good
syllogism
is
it
i
asked
perfectly
he
replied
but
you
see
it
begs
the
whole
question
which
is
the
crime
committed
by
the
person
who
made
this
that
is
where
the
corroboration
is
required
that
practically
leaves
the
case
to
be
investigated
without
reference
to
the
which
thus
becomes
of
no
importance
not
at
all
rejoined
thorndyke
the
is
a
most
valuable
clue
as
long
as
its
evidential
value
is
not
exaggerated
take
our
present
case
for
instance
without
the
the
robbery
might
have
been
committed
by
anybody
there
is
no
clue
whatever
but
the
existence
of
the
narrows
the
inquiry
down
to
reuben
or
some
person
having
access
to
his
yes
i
see
then
you
consider
my
theory
of
john
hornby
as
the
perpetrator
of
the
robbery
as
quite
a
tenable
one
quite
replied
thorndyke
i
have
entertained
it
from
the
first
and
the
new
facts
that
you
have
gathered
increase
its
probability
you
remember
i
said
that
four
hypotheses
were
possible
that
the
robbery
was
committed
either
by
reuben
by
walter
by
john
hornby
or
by
some
other
person
now
putting
aside
the
other
person
for
consideration
only
if
the
first
three
hypotheses
fail
we
have
left
reuben
walter
and
john
but
if
we
leave
the
out
of
the
question
the
probabilities
evidently
point
to
john
hornby
since
he
admittedly
had
access
to
the
diamonds
whereas
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
the
others
had
the
however
transfers
the
suspicion
to
reuben
but
yet
as
your
theory
makes
evident
it
does
not
completely
clear
john
hornby
as
the
case
stands
the
balance
of
probabilities
may
be
stated
thus
john
hornby
undoubtedly
had
access
to
the
diamonds
and
therefore
might
have
stolen
them
but
if
the
was
made
after
he
closed
the
safe
and
before
he
opened
it
again
some
other
person
must
have
had
access
to
them
and
was
probably
the
thief
the
is
that
of
reuben
hornby
a
fact
that
establishes
a
probability
that
he
stole
the
diamonds
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
had
access
to
them
and
if
he
had
not
he
could
not
have
made
the
in
the
manner
and
at
the
time
stated
but
john
hornby
may
have
had
access
to
the
of
reuben
and
may
possibly
have
obtained
it
in
which
case
he
is
almost
certainly
the
thief
as
to
walter
hornby
he
may
have
had
the
means
of
obtaining
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
had
access
either
to
the
diamonds
or
to
hornby
memorandum
block
the
probabilities
in
his
case
therefore
are
very
slight
the
actual
points
at
issue
then
i
said
are
whether
reuben
had
any
means
of
opening
the
safe
and
whether
hornby
ever
did
actually
have
the
opportunity
of
obtaining
reuben
in
blood
on
his
memorandum
block
yes
replied
thorndyke
those
are
the
points
with
some
others
and
they
are
likely
to
remain
unsettled
reuben
rooms
have
been
searched
by
the
police
who
failed
to
find
any
skeleton
or
duplicate
keys
but
this
proves
nothing
as
he
would
probably
have
made
away
with
them
when
he
heard
of
the
being
found
as
to
the
other
matter
i
have
asked
reuben
and
he
has
no
recollection
of
ever
having
made
a
in
blood
so
there
the
matter
rests
and
what
about
hornby
liability
for
the
diamonds
i
think
we
may
dismiss
that
answered
thorndyke
he
had
undertaken
no
liability
and
there
was
no
negligence
he
would
not
be
liable
at
law
after
my
colleague
retired
which
he
did
quite
early
i
sat
for
a
long
time
pondering
upon
this
singular
case
in
which
i
found
myself
involved
and
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
puzzled
i
became
if
thorndyke
had
no
more
satisfactory
explanation
to
offer
than
that
which
he
had
given
me
this
evening
the
defence
was
hopeless
for
the
court
was
not
likely
to
accept
his
estimate
of
the
evidential
value
of
yet
he
had
given
reuben
something
like
a
positive
assurance
that
there
would
be
an
adequate
defence
and
had
expressed
his
own
positive
conviction
of
the
accused
man
innocence
but
thorndyke
was
not
a
man
to
reach
such
a
conviction
through
merely
sentimental
considerations
the
inevitable
conclusion
was
that
he
had
something
up
his
sleeve
that
he
had
gained
possession
of
some
facts
that
had
escaped
my
observation
and
when
i
had
reached
this
point
i
knocked
out
my
pipe
and
betook
myself
to
bed
chapter
ix
the
prisoner
on
the
following
morning
as
i
emerged
from
my
room
i
met
polton
coming
up
with
a
tray
our
bedrooms
were
on
the
attic
floor
above
the
laboratory
and
workshop
and
i
accordingly
followed
him
into
my
friend
chamber
i
sha
go
out
said
thorndyke
though
i
shall
come
down
presently
it
is
very
inconvenient
but
one
must
accept
the
inevitable
i
have
had
a
knock
on
the
head
and
although
i
feel
none
the
worse
i
must
take
the
proper
precautions
rest
and
a
low
diet
until
i
see
that
no
results
are
going
to
follow
you
can
attend
to
the
scalp
wound
and
send
round
the
necessary
letters
ca
you
i
expressed
my
willingness
to
do
all
that
was
required
and
applauded
my
friend
and
good
sense
indeed
i
could
not
help
contrasting
the
conduct
of
this
busy
indefatigable
man
cheerfully
resigning
himself
to
most
distasteful
inaction
with
the
fussy
behaviour
of
the
ordinary
patient
who
with
nothing
of
importance
to
do
can
hardly
be
prevailed
upon
to
rest
no
matter
how
urgent
the
necessity
accordingly
i
breakfasted
alone
and
spent
the
morning
in
writing
and
despatching
letters
to
the
various
persons
who
were
expecting
visits
from
my
colleague
shortly
after
lunch
a
very
spare
one
by
the
way
for
polton
appeared
to
include
me
in
the
scheme
of
reduced
diet
my
expectant
ear
caught
the
tinkle
of
a
hansom
approaching
down
crown
office
row
here
comes
your
fair
companion
said
thorndyke
whom
i
had
acquainted
with
my
arrangements
tell
hornby
from
me
to
keep
up
his
courage
and
for
yourself
bear
my
warning
in
mind
i
should
be
sorry
indeed
if
you
ever
had
cause
to
regret
that
you
had
rendered
me
the
very
valuable
services
for
which
i
am
now
indebted
to
you
do
keep
her
waiting
i
ran
down
the
stairs
and
came
out
of
the
entry
just
as
the
cabman
had
pulled
up
and
flung
open
the
doors
holloway
prison
main
entrance
i
said
as
i
stepped
up
on
to
the
footboard
there
ai
no
back
door
there
sir
the
man
responded
with
a
grin
and
i
was
glad
that
neither
the
answer
nor
the
grin
was
conveyed
to
my
you
are
very
punctual
miss
gibson
i
said
it
is
not
one
yet
yes
i
thought
i
should
like
to
get
there
by
two
so
as
to
have
as
long
a
time
with
him
as
is
possible
without
shortening
your
interview
i
looked
at
my
companion
critically
she
was
dressed
with
rather
more
than
her
usual
care
and
looked
in
fact
a
very
fine
lady
indeed
this
circumstance
which
i
noted
at
first
with
surprise
and
then
with
decided
approbation
caused
me
some
inward
discomfort
for
i
had
in
my
mind
a
very
distinct
and
highly
disagreeable
picture
of
the
visiting
arrangements
at
a
local
prison
in
one
of
the
provinces
at
which
i
had
acted
temporarily
as
medical
officer
i
suppose
i
said
at
length
it
is
of
no
use
for
me
to
the
question
of
the
advisability
of
this
visit
on
your
part
not
the
least
she
replied
resolutely
though
i
understand
and
appreciate
your
motive
in
wishing
to
do
so
then
said
i
if
you
are
really
decided
it
will
be
as
well
for
me
to
prepare
you
for
the
ordeal
i
am
afraid
it
will
give
you
a
terrible
shock
indeed
said
she
is
it
so
bad
tell
me
what
it
will
be
like
in
the
first
place
i
replied
you
must
keep
in
your
mind
the
purpose
of
a
prison
like
holloway
we
are
going
to
see
an
innocent
man
a
cultivated
and
honourable
gentleman
but
the
ordinary
inmates
of
holloway
are
not
innocent
men
for
the
most
part
the
remand
cases
on
the
male
side
are
professional
criminals
while
the
women
are
either
petty
offenders
or
chronic
inebriates
most
of
them
are
regular
customers
at
the
prison
such
is
the
idiotic
state
of
the
law
who
come
into
the
like
travellers
entering
a
familiar
hostelry
address
the
prison
officers
by
name
and
demand
the
usual
privileges
and
extra
comforts
the
for
instance
generally
ask
for
a
dose
of
bromide
to
steady
their
nerves
and
a
light
in
the
cell
to
keep
away
the
horrors
and
such
being
the
character
of
the
inmates
their
friends
who
visit
them
are
naturally
of
the
same
type
the
lowest
outpourings
of
the
slums
and
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
that
the
arrangements
of
the
prison
are
made
to
fit
its
ordinary
inmates
the
innocent
man
is
a
negligible
quantity
and
no
arrangements
are
made
for
him
or
his
visitors
but
shall
we
not
be
taken
to
reuben
cell
asked
miss
gibson
bless
you
no
i
answered
and
determined
to
give
her
every
inducement
to
change
her
mind
i
continued
i
will
describe
the
procedure
as
i
have
seen
it
and
a
very
dreadful
and
shocking
sight
i
found
it
i
can
tell
you
it
was
while
i
was
acting
as
a
prison
doctor
in
the
midlands
that
i
had
this
experience
i
was
going
my
round
one
morning
when
passing
along
a
passage
i
became
aware
of
a
strange
muffled
roar
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
is
that
noise
i
asked
the
warder
who
was
with
me
seeing
their
friends
he
answered
to
have
a
look
at
them
sir
he
unlocked
a
small
door
and
as
he
threw
it
open
the
distant
muffled
sound
swelled
into
a
deafening
roar
i
passed
through
the
door
and
found
myself
in
a
narrow
alley
at
one
end
of
which
a
warder
was
sitting
the
sides
of
the
alley
were
formed
by
two
immense
cages
with
stout
wire
bars
one
for
the
prisoners
and
the
other
for
the
visitors
and
each
cage
was
lined
with
faces
and
hands
all
in
incessant
movement
the
faces
mouthing
and
grimacing
and
the
hands
clawing
restlessly
at
the
bars
the
uproar
was
so
terrific
that
no
single
voice
could
be
distinguished
though
every
one
present
was
shouting
his
loudest
to
make
himself
heard
above
the
universal
din
the
result
was
a
very
strange
and
horrid
illusion
for
it
seemed
as
if
no
one
was
speaking
at
all
but
that
the
noise
came
from
outside
and
that
each
one
of
the
faces
low
vicious
faces
mostly
was
silently
grimacing
and
gibbering
snapping
its
jaws
and
glaring
furiously
at
the
occupants
of
the
opposite
cage
it
was
a
frightful
spectacle
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
at
the
zoo
it
seemed
as
if
one
ought
to
walk
up
the
alley
and
offer
nuts
and
pieces
of
paper
to
be
torn
to
pieces
horrible
exclaimed
miss
gibson
and
do
you
mean
to
say
that
we
shall
be
turned
loose
into
one
of
these
cages
with
a
herd
of
other
visitors
no
you
are
not
turned
loose
anywhere
in
a
prison
the
arrangement
is
this
each
cage
is
divided
by
partitions
into
a
number
of
small
boxes
or
apartments
which
are
numbered
the
prisoner
is
locked
in
one
box
and
his
visitor
in
the
corresponding
box
opposite
they
are
thus
confronted
with
the
width
of
the
alley
between
them
they
can
see
one
another
and
talk
but
can
not
pass
any
forbidden
articles
across
a
very
necessary
precaution
i
need
hardly
say
yes
i
suppose
it
is
necessary
but
it
is
horrible
for
decent
people
surely
they
ought
to
be
able
to
discriminate
why
not
give
it
up
and
let
me
take
a
message
to
reuben
he
would
understand
and
be
thankful
to
me
for
dissuading
you
no
no
she
said
quickly
the
more
repulsive
it
is
the
greater
the
necessity
for
me
to
go
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
think
that
a
trifling
inconvenience
or
indignity
is
enough
to
scare
his
friends
away
what
building
is
that
ahead
we
had
just
swung
round
from
caledonian
road
into
a
quiet
and
suburban
street
at
the
end
of
which
rose
the
tower
of
a
castellated
building
that
is
the
prison
i
replied
we
are
looking
at
it
from
the
most
advantageous
point
of
view
seen
from
the
back
and
especially
from
the
inside
it
is
a
good
deal
less
attractive
nothing
more
was
said
until
the
cab
drove
into
the
courtyard
and
set
us
down
outside
the
great
front
gates
having
directed
the
cabman
to
wait
for
us
i
rang
the
bell
and
we
were
speedily
admitted
through
a
wicket
which
was
immediately
closed
and
locked
into
a
covered
court
closed
in
by
a
second
gate
through
the
bars
of
which
we
could
see
across
an
inner
courtyard
to
the
actual
entrance
to
the
prison
here
while
the
necessary
formalities
were
gone
through
we
found
ourselves
part
of
a
numerous
and
very
motley
company
for
a
considerable
assemblage
of
the
prisoners
friends
was
awaiting
the
moment
of
admission
i
noticed
that
my
companion
was
observing
our
with
a
kind
of
horrified
curiosity
which
she
strove
however
and
not
unsuccessfully
to
conceal
and
certainly
the
appearance
of
the
majority
furnished
eloquent
testimony
to
the
failure
of
crime
as
a
means
of
worldly
advancement
their
present
position
was
productive
of
very
varied
emotions
some
were
silent
and
evidently
stricken
with
grief
a
larger
number
were
voluble
and
excited
while
a
considerable
proportion
were
quite
cheerful
and
even
inclined
to
be
facetious
at
length
the
great
iron
gate
was
unlocked
and
our
party
taken
in
charge
by
a
warder
who
conducted
us
to
that
part
of
the
building
known
as
the
wing
and
in
the
course
of
our
progress
i
could
not
help
observing
the
profound
impression
made
upon
my
companion
by
the
circumstance
that
every
door
had
to
be
unlocked
to
admit
us
and
was
locked
again
as
soon
as
we
had
passed
through
it
seems
to
me
i
said
as
we
neared
our
destination
that
you
had
better
let
me
see
reuben
first
i
have
not
much
to
say
to
him
and
shall
not
keep
you
waiting
long
why
do
you
think
so
she
asked
with
a
shade
of
suspicion
well
i
answered
i
think
you
may
be
a
little
upset
by
the
interview
and
i
should
like
to
see
you
into
your
cab
as
soon
as
possible
afterwards
yes
she
said
perhaps
you
are
right
and
it
is
kind
of
you
to
be
so
thoughtful
on
my
account
a
minute
later
accordingly
i
found
myself
shut
into
a
narrow
box
like
one
of
those
which
considerate
pawnbrokers
provide
for
their
more
diffident
clients
and
in
a
similar
but
more
intense
degree
pervaded
by
a
subtle
odour
of
uncleanness
the
woodwork
was
polished
to
an
unctuous
smoothness
by
the
friction
of
numberless
dirty
hands
and
soiled
garments
and
the
general
appearance
taken
in
at
a
glance
as
i
entered
was
such
as
to
cause
me
to
thrust
my
hands
into
my
pockets
and
studiously
avoid
contact
with
any
part
of
the
structure
but
the
floor
the
end
of
the
box
opposite
the
door
was
closed
in
by
a
strong
grating
of
wire
excepting
the
lower
three
feet
which
was
of
wood
and
looking
through
this
i
perceived
behind
a
second
grating
reuben
hornby
standing
in
a
similar
attitude
to
my
own
he
was
dressed
in
his
usual
clothes
and
with
his
customary
neatness
but
his
face
was
unshaven
and
he
wore
suspended
from
a
a
circular
label
bearing
the
characters
and
these
two
changes
in
his
exterior
carried
with
them
a
suggestiveness
as
subtle
as
it
was
unpleasant
making
me
more
than
ever
regretful
that
miss
gibson
had
insisted
on
coming
it
is
exceedingly
good
of
you
jervis
to
come
and
see
me
he
said
heartily
making
himself
heard
quite
easily
to
my
surprise
above
the
hubbub
of
the
adjoining
boxes
but
i
did
expect
you
here
i
was
told
i
could
see
my
legal
advisers
in
the
solicitor
box
so
you
could
i
answered
but
i
came
here
by
choice
because
i
have
brought
miss
gibson
with
me
i
am
sorry
for
that
he
rejoined
with
evident
disapproval
she
ought
to
have
come
among
these
i
told
her
so
and
that
you
would
like
it
but
she
insisted
i
know
said
reuben
that
the
worst
of
women
they
will
make
a
beastly
fuss
and
sacrifice
themselves
when
nobody
wants
them
to
but
i
must
be
ungrateful
she
means
it
kindly
and
she
a
deuced
good
sort
is
juliet
she
is
indeed
i
exclaimed
not
a
little
disgusted
at
his
cool
unappreciative
tone
a
most
girl
and
her
devotion
to
you
is
positively
heroic
the
faintest
suspicion
of
a
smile
appeared
on
the
face
seen
through
the
double
grating
on
which
i
felt
that
i
could
have
pulled
his
nose
with
pleasure
only
that
a
pair
of
tongs
of
special
construction
would
have
been
required
for
the
purpose
yes
he
answered
calmly
we
have
always
been
very
good
friends
a
rejoinder
of
the
most
extreme
acidity
was
on
my
lips
damn
the
fellow
what
did
he
mean
by
speaking
in
that
supercilious
tone
of
the
loveliest
and
sweetest
woman
in
the
world
but
after
all
one
can
not
trample
on
a
poor
devil
locked
up
in
a
jail
on
a
false
charge
no
matter
how
great
may
be
the
provocation
i
drew
a
deep
breath
and
having
recovered
myself
outwardly
at
least
said
i
hope
you
do
find
the
conditions
here
too
intolerable
oh
no
he
answered
it
beastly
unpleasant
of
course
but
it
might
easily
be
worse
i
do
mind
if
it
only
for
a
week
or
two
and
i
am
really
encouraged
by
what
thorndyke
said
i
hope
he
was
being
merely
soothing
you
may
take
it
that
he
was
not
what
he
said
i
am
sure
he
meant
of
course
you
know
i
am
not
in
his
confidence
nobody
is
but
i
gather
that
he
is
satisfied
with
the
defence
he
is
preparing
if
he
is
satisfied
i
am
said
reuben
and
in
any
case
i
shall
owe
him
an
immense
debt
of
gratitude
for
having
stood
by
me
and
believed
in
me
when
all
the
world
except
my
aunt
and
juliet
had
condemned
me
he
then
went
on
to
give
me
a
few
particulars
of
his
prison
life
and
when
he
had
chatted
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
i
took
my
leave
to
make
way
for
miss
gibson
her
interview
with
him
was
not
as
long
as
i
had
expected
though
to
be
sure
the
conditions
were
not
very
favourable
either
for
the
exchange
of
confidences
or
for
utterances
of
a
sentimental
character
the
consciousness
that
one
conversation
could
be
overheard
by
the
occupants
of
adjacent
boxes
destroyed
all
sense
of
privacy
to
say
nothing
of
the
disturbing
influence
of
the
warder
in
the
when
she
rejoined
me
her
manner
was
abstracted
and
very
depressed
a
circumstance
that
gave
me
considerable
food
for
reflection
as
we
made
our
way
in
silence
towards
the
main
entrance
had
she
found
reuben
as
cool
and
as
i
had
he
was
assuredly
a
very
calm
and
lover
and
it
was
conceivable
that
his
reception
of
the
girl
strung
up
as
she
was
to
an
acute
pitch
of
emotion
might
have
been
somewhat
in
the
nature
of
an
anticlimax
and
then
was
it
possible
that
the
feeling
was
on
her
side
only
could
it
be
that
the
priceless
pearl
of
her
love
was
cast
before
i
was
tempted
to
use
the
colloquial
singular
and
call
him
an
unappreciative
swine
the
thing
was
almost
unthinkable
to
me
and
yet
i
was
tempted
to
dwell
upon
it
for
when
a
man
is
in
love
and
i
could
no
longer
disguise
my
condition
from
myself
he
is
inclined
to
be
humble
and
to
gather
up
thankfully
the
treasure
that
is
rejected
of
another
i
was
brought
up
short
in
these
reflections
by
the
clank
of
the
lock
in
the
great
iron
gate
we
entered
together
the
gloomy
vestibule
and
a
moment
later
were
let
out
through
the
wicket
into
the
courtyard
and
as
the
lock
clicked
behind
us
we
gave
a
simultaneous
sigh
of
relief
to
find
ourselves
outside
the
precincts
of
the
prison
beyond
the
domain
of
bolts
and
bars
i
had
settled
miss
gibson
in
the
cab
and
given
her
address
to
the
driver
when
i
noticed
her
looking
at
me
as
i
thought
somewhat
wistfully
ca
i
put
you
down
somewhere
she
said
in
response
to
a
glance
from
me
i
seized
the
opportunity
with
thankfulness
and
replied
you
might
set
me
down
at
king
cross
if
it
is
not
delaying
you
and
giving
the
word
to
the
cabman
i
took
my
place
by
her
side
as
the
cab
started
and
a
prison
van
turned
into
the
courtyard
with
its
freight
of
squalid
misery
i
do
think
reuben
was
very
pleased
to
see
me
miss
gibson
remarked
presently
but
i
shall
come
again
all
the
same
it
is
a
duty
i
owe
both
to
him
and
to
myself
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
endeavour
to
dissuade
her
but
the
reflection
that
her
visits
must
almost
of
necessity
involve
my
companionship
enfeebled
my
will
i
was
fast
approaching
a
state
of
infatuation
i
was
so
thankful
she
continued
that
you
prepared
me
it
was
a
horrible
experience
to
see
the
poor
fellow
caged
like
a
wild
beast
with
that
dreadful
label
hanging
from
his
coat
but
it
would
have
been
overwhelming
if
i
had
not
known
what
to
expect
as
we
proceeded
her
spirits
revived
somewhat
a
circumstance
that
she
graciously
ascribed
to
the
enlivening
influence
of
my
society
and
i
then
told
her
of
the
mishap
that
had
befallen
my
colleague
what
a
terrible
thing
she
exclaimed
with
evidently
unaffected
concern
it
is
the
merest
chance
that
he
was
not
killed
on
the
spot
is
he
much
hurt
and
would
he
mind
do
you
think
if
i
called
to
inquire
after
him
i
said
that
i
was
sure
he
would
be
delighted
being
as
a
matter
of
fact
entirely
indifferent
as
to
his
sentiments
on
the
subject
in
my
delight
at
the
proposal
and
when
i
stepped
down
from
the
cab
at
cross
to
pursue
my
way
homewards
there
already
opened
out
before
me
the
prospect
of
the
renewal
of
this
and
all
too
dangerous
companionship
on
the
morrow
chapter
x
polton
is
mystified
a
couple
of
days
sufficed
to
prove
that
thorndyke
mishap
was
not
to
be
productive
of
any
permanent
ill
consequences
his
wounds
progressed
favourably
and
he
was
able
to
resume
his
ordinary
avocations
miss
gibson
visit
but
why
should
i
speak
of
her
in
these
formal
terms
to
me
when
i
thought
of
her
which
i
did
only
too
often
she
was
juliet
with
perhaps
an
adjective
thrown
in
and
as
juliet
i
shall
henceforth
speak
of
her
but
without
the
adjective
in
this
narrative
wherein
nothing
has
been
kept
back
from
the
reader
juliet
visit
then
had
been
a
great
success
for
my
colleague
was
really
pleased
by
the
attention
and
displayed
a
quiet
geniality
that
filled
our
visitor
with
delight
he
talked
a
good
deal
of
reuben
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
endeavouring
to
settle
in
his
own
mind
the
vexed
question
of
her
relations
with
and
sentiments
towards
our
unfortunate
client
but
what
conclusions
he
arrived
at
i
was
unable
to
discover
for
he
was
by
no
means
communicative
after
she
had
left
nor
was
there
any
repetition
of
the
visit
greatly
to
my
regret
since
as
i
have
said
he
was
able
in
a
day
or
two
to
resume
his
ordinary
mode
of
life
the
first
evidence
i
had
of
his
renewed
activity
appeared
when
i
returned
to
the
chambers
at
about
eleven
in
the
morning
to
find
polton
hovering
dejectedly
about
the
apparently
perpetrating
as
near
an
approach
to
a
spring
clean
as
could
be
permitted
in
a
bachelor
establishment
hallo
polton
i
exclaimed
have
you
contrived
to
tear
yourself
away
from
the
laboratory
for
an
hour
or
two
no
sir
he
answered
gloomily
the
laboratory
has
torn
itself
away
from
me
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
the
doctor
has
shut
himself
in
and
locked
the
door
and
he
says
i
am
not
to
disturb
him
it
will
be
a
cold
lunch
what
is
he
doing
in
there
i
inquired
ah
said
polton
that
just
what
i
should
like
to
know
i
fair
eaten
up
with
curiosity
he
is
making
some
experiments
in
connection
with
some
of
his
cases
and
when
the
doctor
locks
himself
in
to
make
experiments
something
interesting
generally
follows
i
should
like
to
know
what
it
is
this
time
i
suppose
there
is
a
keyhole
in
the
laboratory
door
i
suggested
with
a
grin
sir
he
exclaimed
indignantly
jervis
i
am
surprised
at
you
then
perceiving
my
facetious
intent
he
smiled
also
and
added
but
there
a
keyhole
if
you
like
to
try
it
though
i
wager
the
doctor
would
see
more
of
you
than
you
would
of
him
you
are
mighty
secret
about
your
doings
you
and
the
doctor
i
said
yes
he
answered
you
see
it
a
queer
trade
this
of
the
doctor
and
there
are
some
queer
secrets
in
it
now
for
instance
what
do
you
make
of
this
he
produced
from
his
pocket
a
leather
case
whence
he
took
a
piece
of
paper
which
he
handed
to
me
on
it
was
a
neatly
executed
drawing
of
what
looked
like
one
of
a
set
of
chessmen
with
the
dimensions
written
on
the
margin
it
looks
like
a
pawn
one
of
the
staunton
pattern
i
said
just
what
i
thought
but
it
is
i
got
to
make
of
them
and
what
the
doctor
is
going
to
do
with
them
fairly
beats
me
perhaps
he
has
invented
some
new
game
i
suggested
facetiously
he
is
always
inventing
new
games
and
playing
them
mostly
in
courts
of
law
and
then
the
other
players
generally
lose
but
this
is
a
puzzler
and
no
mistake
of
these
to
be
turned
up
in
the
boxwood
what
can
they
be
for
something
to
do
with
the
experiments
he
is
carrying
on
upstairs
at
this
very
moment
i
expect
he
shook
his
head
and
having
carefully
returned
the
drawing
to
his
said
in
a
solemn
tone
sir
there
are
times
when
the
doctor
makes
me
fairly
dance
with
curiosity
and
this
is
one
of
them
although
not
afflicted
with
a
curiosity
so
acute
as
that
of
polton
i
found
myself
speculating
at
intervals
on
the
nature
of
my
experiments
and
the
purpose
of
the
singular
little
objects
which
he
had
ordered
to
be
made
but
i
was
unacquainted
with
any
of
the
cases
on
which
he
was
engaged
excepting
that
of
reuben
hornby
and
with
the
latter
i
was
quite
unable
to
connect
a
set
of
boxwood
chessmen
moreover
on
this
day
i
was
to
accompany
juliet
on
her
second
visit
to
holloway
and
that
circumstance
gave
me
abundant
mental
occupation
of
another
kind
at
lunch
thorndyke
was
animated
and
talkative
but
not
communicative
he
had
some
work
in
the
laboratory
that
he
must
do
himself
he
said
but
gave
no
hint
as
to
its
nature
and
as
soon
as
our
meal
was
finished
he
returned
to
his
labours
leaving
me
to
pace
up
and
down
the
walk
listening
with
ridiculous
eagerness
for
the
sound
of
the
hansom
that
was
to
transport
me
to
the
regions
of
the
blest
and
incidentally
to
holloway
prison
when
i
returned
to
the
temple
the
was
empty
and
hideously
neat
as
the
result
of
polton
efforts
my
colleague
was
evidently
still
at
work
in
the
laboratory
and
from
the
circumstance
that
the
were
set
out
on
the
table
and
a
kettle
of
water
placed
in
readiness
on
the
by
the
fireplace
i
gathered
that
polton
also
was
full
of
business
and
anxious
not
to
be
disturbed
accordingly
i
lit
the
gas
and
made
my
tea
enlivening
my
solitude
by
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
events
of
the
afternoon
juliet
had
been
charming
as
she
always
was
frank
friendly
and
unaffectedly
pleased
to
have
my
companionship
she
evidently
liked
me
and
did
not
disguise
the
fact
why
should
she
indeed
but
treated
me
with
a
freedom
almost
affectionate
as
though
i
had
been
a
favourite
brother
which
was
very
delightful
and
would
have
been
more
so
if
i
could
have
accepted
the
relationship
as
to
her
feelings
towards
me
i
had
not
the
slightest
misgiving
and
so
my
conscience
was
clear
for
juliet
was
as
innocent
as
a
child
with
the
innocence
that
belongs
to
the
direct
straightforward
nature
that
neither
does
evil
itself
nor
looks
for
evil
motives
in
others
for
myself
i
was
past
praying
for
the
thing
was
done
and
i
must
pay
the
price
hereafter
content
to
reflect
that
i
had
trespassed
against
no
one
but
myself
it
was
a
miserable
affair
and
many
a
heartache
did
it
promise
me
in
the
lonely
days
that
were
to
come
when
i
should
have
said
to
the
temple
and
gone
back
to
my
old
nomadic
life
and
yet
i
would
not
have
had
it
changed
if
i
could
would
not
have
bartered
the
memories
for
dull
forgetfulness
but
other
matters
had
transpired
in
the
course
of
our
drive
than
those
that
loomed
so
large
to
me
in
the
egotism
of
my
love
we
had
spoken
of
hornby
and
his
affairs
and
from
our
talk
there
had
emerged
certain
facts
of
no
little
moment
to
the
inquiry
on
which
i
was
engaged
misfortunes
are
proverbially
sociable
juliet
had
remarked
in
reference
to
her
adopted
uncle
as
if
this
trouble
about
reuben
were
not
enough
there
are
worries
in
the
city
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
them
i
replied
that
walter
had
mentioned
the
matter
to
me
yes
said
juliet
rather
viciously
i
am
not
quite
clear
as
to
what
part
that
good
gentleman
has
played
in
the
matter
it
has
come
out
quite
accidentally
that
he
had
a
large
holding
in
the
mines
himself
but
he
seems
to
have
his
loss
as
the
phrase
goes
and
got
out
of
them
though
how
he
managed
to
pay
such
large
differences
is
more
than
we
can
understand
we
think
he
must
have
raised
money
somehow
to
do
it
do
you
know
when
the
mines
began
to
depreciate
i
asked
yes
it
was
quite
a
sudden
affair
what
walter
calls
slump
and
it
occurred
only
a
few
days
before
the
robbery
hornby
was
telling
me
about
it
only
yesterday
and
he
recalled
it
to
me
by
a
ridiculous
accident
that
happened
on
that
day
what
was
that
i
inquired
why
i
cut
my
finger
and
nearly
fainted
she
answered
with
a
shamefaced
little
laugh
it
was
rather
a
bad
cut
you
know
but
i
did
notice
it
until
i
found
my
hand
covered
with
blood
then
i
turned
suddenly
faint
and
had
to
lie
down
on
the
hearthrug
it
was
in
hornby
study
which
i
was
tidying
up
at
the
time
here
i
was
found
by
reuben
and
a
dreadful
fright
it
gave
him
at
first
and
then
he
tore
up
his
handkerchief
to
tie
up
the
wounded
finger
and
you
never
saw
such
an
awful
mess
as
he
got
his
hands
in
he
might
have
been
arrested
as
a
murderer
poor
boy
from
the
condition
he
was
in
it
will
make
your
professional
gorge
rise
to
learn
that
he
fastened
up
the
extemporised
bandage
with
red
tape
which
he
got
from
the
writing
table
after
rooting
about
among
the
sacred
papers
in
the
most
ruthless
fashion
when
he
had
gone
i
tried
to
put
the
things
on
the
table
straight
again
and
really
you
might
have
thought
some
horrible
crime
had
been
committed
the
envelopes
and
papers
were
all
smeared
with
blood
and
marked
with
the
print
of
gory
fingers
i
remembered
it
afterwards
when
reuben
was
identified
and
thought
that
perhaps
one
of
the
papers
might
have
got
into
the
safe
by
accident
but
hornby
told
me
that
was
impossible
he
tore
the
leaf
off
his
memorandum
block
at
the
time
when
he
put
away
the
diamonds
such
was
the
gist
of
our
conversation
as
the
cab
rattled
through
the
streets
on
the
way
to
the
prison
and
certainly
it
contained
matter
sufficiently
important
to
draw
away
my
thoughts
from
other
subjects
more
agreeable
but
less
relevant
to
the
case
with
a
sudden
remembrance
of
my
duty
i
drew
forth
my
notebook
and
was
in
the
act
of
committing
the
statements
to
writing
when
thorndyke
entered
the
room
do
let
me
interrupt
you
jervis
said
he
i
will
make
myself
a
cup
of
tea
while
you
finish
your
writing
and
then
you
shall
exhibit
the
day
catch
and
hang
your
nets
out
to
dry
i
was
not
long
in
finishing
my
notes
for
i
was
in
a
fever
of
impatience
to
hear
thorndyke
comments
on
my
latest
addition
to
our
store
of
information
by
the
time
the
kettle
was
boiling
my
entries
were
completed
and
i
proceeded
forthwith
to
retail
to
my
colleague
those
extracts
from
my
conversation
with
juliet
that
i
have
just
recorded
he
listened
as
usual
with
deep
and
critical
attention
this
is
very
interesting
and
important
he
said
when
i
had
finished
really
jervis
you
are
a
most
invaluable
coadjutor
it
seems
that
information
which
would
be
strictly
withheld
from
the
forbidding
jorkins
trickles
freely
and
unasked
into
the
ear
of
the
genial
spenlow
now
i
suppose
you
regard
your
hypothesis
as
having
received
very
substantial
confirmation
certainly
i
do
and
very
justifiably
you
see
now
how
completely
you
were
in
the
right
when
you
allowed
yourself
to
entertain
this
theory
of
the
crime
in
spite
of
its
apparent
improbability
by
the
light
of
these
new
facts
it
has
become
quite
a
probable
explanation
of
the
whole
affair
and
if
it
could
only
be
shown
that
hornby
memorandum
block
was
among
the
papers
on
the
table
it
would
rise
to
a
high
degree
of
probability
the
obvious
moral
is
never
disregard
the
improbable
by
the
way
it
is
odd
that
reuben
failed
to
recall
this
occurrence
when
i
questioned
him
of
course
the
bloody
were
not
discovered
until
he
had
gone
but
one
would
have
expected
him
to
recall
the
circumstance
when
i
asked
him
pointedly
if
he
had
never
left
bloody
on
any
papers
i
must
try
to
find
out
if
hornby
memorandum
block
was
on
the
table
and
among
the
marked
papers
i
said
yes
that
would
be
wise
he
answered
though
i
do
suppose
the
information
will
be
forthcoming
my
colleague
manner
rather
disappointed
me
he
had
heard
my
report
with
the
greatest
attention
he
had
discussed
it
with
animation
but
yet
he
seemed
to
attach
to
the
new
and
as
they
appeared
to
me
highly
important
facts
an
interest
that
was
academic
rather
than
practical
of
course
his
calmness
might
be
assumed
but
this
did
not
seem
likely
for
john
thorndyke
was
far
too
sincere
and
dignified
a
character
to
cultivate
in
private
life
the
artifices
of
the
actor
to
strangers
indeed
he
presented
habitually
a
calm
and
impassive
exterior
but
this
was
natural
to
him
and
was
but
the
outward
sign
of
his
even
and
judicial
habit
of
mind
no
there
was
no
doubt
that
my
startling
news
had
left
him
unmoved
and
this
must
be
for
one
of
two
reasons
either
he
already
knew
all
that
i
had
told
him
which
was
perfectly
possible
or
he
had
some
other
and
better
means
of
explaining
the
crime
i
was
turning
over
these
two
alternatives
not
unobserved
by
my
watchful
colleague
when
polton
entered
the
room
a
broad
grin
was
on
his
face
and
a
that
he
carried
like
a
tray
bore
neatly
turned
boxwood
pieces
thorndyke
at
once
entered
into
the
unspoken
jest
that
beamed
from
the
countenance
of
his
subordinate
here
is
polton
with
a
problem
for
you
jervis
he
said
he
assumes
that
i
have
invented
a
new
parlour
game
and
has
been
trying
to
work
out
the
moves
have
you
succeeded
yet
polton
no
sir
i
have
but
i
suspect
that
one
of
the
players
will
be
a
man
in
a
wig
and
gown
perhaps
you
are
right
said
thorndyke
but
that
does
take
you
very
far
let
us
hear
what
jervis
has
to
say
i
can
make
nothing
of
them
i
answered
polton
showed
me
the
drawing
this
morning
and
then
was
terrified
lest
he
had
committed
a
breach
of
confidence
and
i
have
been
trying
ever
since
without
a
glimmer
of
success
to
guess
what
they
can
be
for
h
grunted
thorndyke
as
he
sauntered
up
and
down
the
room
teacup
in
hand
to
guess
eh
i
like
not
that
word
in
the
mouth
of
a
man
of
science
what
do
you
mean
by
a
his
manner
was
wholly
facetious
but
i
professed
to
take
his
question
seriously
and
replied
by
a
guess
i
mean
a
conclusion
arrived
at
without
data
impossible
he
exclaimed
with
mock
sternness
nobody
but
an
utter
fool
arrives
at
a
conclusion
without
data
then
i
must
revise
my
definition
instantly
i
rejoined
let
us
say
that
a
guess
is
a
conclusion
drawn
from
insufficient
facts
that
is
better
said
he
but
perhaps
it
would
be
better
still
to
say
that
a
guess
is
a
particular
and
definite
conclusion
deduced
from
facts
which
properly
yield
only
a
general
and
indefinite
one
let
us
take
an
instance
he
continued
looking
out
of
the
window
i
see
a
man
walking
round
paper
buildings
now
suppose
i
say
after
the
fashion
of
the
inspired
detective
of
the
romances
man
is
a
stationmaster
or
inspector
that
would
be
a
guess
the
observed
facts
do
not
yield
the
conclusion
though
they
do
warrant
a
conclusion
less
definite
and
more
general
you
have
been
right
though
sir
exclaimed
polton
who
had
stepped
forward
with
me
to
examine
the
unconscious
subject
of
the
demonstration
that
gent
used
to
be
the
stationmaster
at
camberwell
i
remember
him
well
the
little
man
was
evidently
greatly
impressed
i
happen
to
be
right
you
see
said
thorndyke
but
i
might
as
easily
have
been
wrong
you
were
though
sir
said
polton
you
spotted
him
at
a
glance
in
his
admiration
of
the
result
he
cared
not
a
fig
for
the
correctness
of
the
means
by
which
it
had
been
attained
now
why
do
i
suggest
that
he
is
a
stationmaster
pursued
thorndyke
disregarding
his
assistant
comment
i
suppose
you
were
looking
at
his
feet
i
answered
i
seem
to
have
noticed
that
peculiar
gait
in
stationmasters
now
that
you
mention
it
quite
so
the
arch
of
the
foot
has
given
way
the
plantar
ligaments
have
become
stretched
and
the
deep
calf
muscles
weakened
then
since
bending
of
the
weakened
arch
causes
discomfort
the
feet
have
become
turned
outwards
by
which
the
bending
of
the
foot
is
reduced
to
a
minimum
and
as
the
left
foot
is
the
more
flattened
so
it
is
turned
out
more
than
the
right
then
the
turning
out
of
the
toes
causes
the
legs
to
splay
outward
from
the
knees
downwards
a
very
conspicuous
condition
in
a
tall
man
like
this
one
and
you
notice
that
the
left
leg
splays
out
more
than
the
other
but
we
know
that
depression
of
the
arch
of
the
foot
is
brought
about
by
standing
for
long
periods
continuous
pressure
on
a
living
structure
weakens
it
while
intermittent
pressure
strengthens
it
so
the
man
who
stands
on
his
feet
continuously
develops
a
flat
instep
and
a
weak
calf
while
the
professional
dancer
or
runner
acquires
a
high
instep
and
a
strong
calf
now
there
are
many
occupations
which
involve
prolonged
standing
and
so
induce
the
condition
of
flat
foot
waiters
hawkers
policemen
salesmen
and
station
officials
are
examples
but
the
waiter
gait
is
characteristic
a
quick
shuffling
walk
which
enables
him
to
carry
liquids
without
spilling
them
this
man
walks
with
a
long
swinging
stride
he
is
obviously
not
a
waiter
his
dress
and
appearance
in
general
exclude
the
idea
of
a
hawker
or
even
a
he
is
a
man
of
poor
physique
and
so
can
not
be
a
policeman
the
or
salesman
is
accustomed
to
move
in
relatively
confined
spaces
and
so
acquires
a
short
brisk
step
and
his
dress
tends
to
rather
exuberant
smartness
the
station
official
patrols
long
platforms
often
at
a
rapid
pace
and
so
tends
to
take
long
strides
while
his
dress
is
dignified
and
neat
rather
than
florid
the
characteristics
you
see
appear
in
the
subject
of
our
analysis
he
agrees
with
the
general
description
of
a
stationmaster
but
if
we
therefore
conclude
that
he
a
stationmaster
we
fall
into
the
fallacy
of
the
undistributed
middle
term
the
fallacy
that
haunts
all
brilliant
guessers
including
the
detective
not
only
of
romance
but
too
often
also
of
real
life
all
that
the
observed
facts
justify
us
in
inferring
is
that
this
man
is
engaged
in
some
mode
of
life
that
necessitates
a
good
deal
of
standing
the
rest
is
mere
it
wonderful
said
polton
gazing
at
the
now
distant
figure
perfectly
wonderful
i
should
never
have
known
he
was
a
stationmaster
with
this
and
a
glance
of
deep
admiration
at
his
employer
he
took
his
departure
you
will
also
observe
said
thorndyke
with
a
smile
that
a
fortunate
guess
often
brings
more
credit
than
a
piece
of
sound
reasoning
with
a
less
striking
result
yes
that
is
unfortunately
the
case
and
it
is
certainly
true
in
the
present
instance
your
reputation
as
far
as
polton
is
concerned
is
now
firmly
established
even
if
it
was
not
before
in
his
eyes
you
are
a
wizard
from
whom
nothing
is
hidden
but
to
return
to
these
little
pieces
as
i
must
call
them
for
the
lack
of
a
better
name
i
can
form
no
hypothesis
as
to
their
use
i
seem
to
have
no
as
the
nautical
phrase
goes
from
which
to
start
an
inquiry
i
have
even
the
material
for
ought
i
to
be
able
to
arrive
at
any
opinion
on
the
subject
thorndyke
picked
up
one
of
the
pieces
fingering
it
delicately
and
inspecting
with
a
critical
eye
the
flat
base
on
which
it
stood
and
reflected
for
a
few
moments
it
is
easy
to
trace
a
connection
when
one
knows
all
the
facts
he
said
at
length
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
the
materials
from
which
to
form
a
conjecture
perhaps
i
am
wrong
but
i
think
when
you
have
had
more
experience
you
will
find
yourself
able
to
work
out
a
problem
of
this
kind
what
is
required
is
constructive
imagination
and
a
rigorous
exactness
in
reasoning
now
you
are
a
good
reasoner
and
you
have
recently
shown
me
that
you
have
the
necessary
imagination
you
merely
lack
experience
in
the
use
of
your
faculties
when
you
learn
my
purpose
in
having
these
things
made
as
you
will
before
long
you
will
probably
be
surprised
that
their
use
did
not
occur
to
you
and
now
let
us
go
forth
and
take
a
brisk
walk
to
refresh
ourselves
or
perhaps
i
should
say
myself
after
the
day
labour
chapter
xi
the
ambush
i
am
going
to
ask
for
your
collaboration
in
another
case
said
thorndyke
a
day
or
two
later
it
appears
to
be
one
of
suicide
but
the
solicitors
to
the
office
have
asked
me
to
go
down
to
the
place
which
is
in
the
neighbourhood
of
barnet
and
be
present
at
the
and
the
inquest
they
have
managed
to
arrange
that
the
inquest
shall
take
place
directly
after
the
so
that
we
shall
be
able
to
do
the
whole
business
in
a
single
visit
is
the
case
one
of
any
intricacy
i
asked
i
do
think
so
he
answered
it
looks
like
a
common
suicide
but
you
can
never
tell
the
importance
of
the
case
at
present
arises
entirely
from
the
heavy
insurance
a
verdict
of
suicide
will
mean
a
gain
of
ten
thousand
pounds
to
the
so
naturally
the
directors
are
anxious
to
get
the
case
settled
and
not
inclined
to
boggle
over
a
little
expense
naturally
and
when
will
the
expedition
take
place
i
asked
the
inquest
is
fixed
for
what
is
the
matter
does
that
fall
foul
of
any
arrangement
of
yours
oh
nothing
of
any
importance
i
replied
hastily
deeply
ashamed
of
the
momentary
change
of
countenance
that
my
friend
had
been
so
quick
to
observe
well
what
is
it
persisted
thorndyke
you
have
got
something
on
it
is
nothing
i
tell
you
but
what
can
be
quite
easily
arranged
to
suit
your
plans
h
queried
thorndyke
with
an
exasperating
grin
yes
i
answered
turning
as
red
as
a
pickled
cabbage
since
you
are
so
beastly
inquisitive
miss
gibson
wrote
on
behalf
of
hornby
asking
me
to
dine
with
them
evening
and
i
sent
off
an
acceptance
an
hour
ago
and
you
call
that
of
any
importance
exclaimed
thorndyke
alas
and
likewise
alackaday
which
is
an
approximately
synonymous
expression
the
age
of
chivalry
is
past
indeed
of
course
you
must
keep
your
appointment
i
can
manage
quite
well
alone
we
should
be
back
early
enough
for
me
to
go
to
kensington
from
the
station
i
suppose
no
certainly
not
i
find
that
the
trains
are
very
awkward
we
should
not
reach
king
cross
until
nearly
one
in
the
morning
then
in
that
case
i
shall
write
to
miss
gibson
and
excuse
myself
oh
i
would
do
that
said
thorndyke
it
will
disappoint
them
and
really
it
is
not
necessary
i
shall
write
forthwith
i
said
firmly
so
please
do
try
to
dissuade
me
i
have
been
feeling
quite
uncomfortable
at
the
thought
that
all
the
time
i
have
been
in
your
employ
i
seem
to
have
done
nothing
but
idle
about
and
amuse
myself
the
opportunity
of
doing
something
tangible
for
my
wage
is
too
precious
to
be
allowed
to
slip
thorndyke
chuckled
indulgently
you
shall
do
as
you
please
my
dear
boy
he
said
but
do
imagine
that
you
have
been
eating
the
bread
of
idleness
when
you
see
this
hornby
case
worked
out
in
detail
you
will
be
surprised
to
find
how
large
a
part
you
have
taken
in
unravelling
it
your
worth
to
me
has
been
far
beyond
your
poor
little
salary
i
can
assure
you
it
is
very
handsome
of
you
to
say
that
i
said
highly
gratified
to
learn
that
i
was
really
of
use
and
not
as
i
had
begun
to
suspect
a
mere
object
of
charity
it
is
perfectly
true
he
answered
and
now
since
you
are
going
to
help
me
in
this
case
i
will
set
you
your
task
the
case
as
i
have
said
appears
to
be
quite
simple
but
it
never
does
to
take
the
simplicity
for
granted
here
is
the
letter
from
the
solicitors
giving
the
facts
as
far
as
they
are
known
at
present
on
the
shelves
there
you
will
find
casper
taylor
guy
and
ferrier
and
the
other
authorities
on
medical
jurisprudence
and
i
will
put
out
one
or
two
other
books
that
you
may
find
useful
i
want
you
to
extract
and
make
classified
notes
of
everything
that
may
bear
on
such
a
case
as
the
present
one
may
turn
out
to
be
we
must
go
prepared
to
meet
any
contingency
that
may
arise
this
is
my
invariable
practice
and
even
if
the
case
turns
out
to
be
quite
simple
the
labour
is
never
wasted
for
it
represents
so
much
experience
gained
casper
and
taylor
are
pretty
old
are
they
i
objected
so
is
suicide
he
retorted
drily
it
is
a
capital
mistake
to
neglect
the
old
authorities
were
strong
men
before
agamemnon
and
some
of
them
were
uncommonly
strong
let
me
tell
you
give
your
best
attention
to
the
venerable
casper
and
the
obsolete
taylor
and
you
will
not
be
without
your
reward
as
a
result
of
these
injunctions
i
devoted
the
remainder
of
the
day
to
the
consideration
of
the
various
methods
by
which
a
man
might
contrive
to
effect
his
exit
from
the
stage
of
human
activities
and
a
very
engrossing
study
i
found
it
and
the
more
interesting
in
view
of
the
problem
that
awaited
solution
on
the
morrow
but
yet
not
so
engrossing
but
that
i
was
able
to
find
time
to
write
a
long
rather
intimate
and
minutely
explanatory
letter
to
miss
gibson
in
which
i
even
mentioned
the
hour
of
our
return
as
showing
the
impossibility
of
my
keeping
my
engagement
not
that
i
had
the
smallest
fear
of
her
taking
offence
for
it
is
an
evidence
of
my
respect
and
regard
for
her
that
i
cancelled
the
appointment
without
a
momentary
doubt
that
she
would
approve
of
my
action
but
it
was
pleasant
to
write
to
her
at
length
and
to
feel
the
intimacy
of
keeping
her
informed
of
the
details
of
my
life
the
case
when
we
came
to
inquire
into
it
on
the
spot
turned
out
to
be
a
suicide
of
the
most
transparent
type
whereat
both
thorndyke
and
i
were
i
think
a
little
disappointed
he
at
having
apparently
done
so
little
for
a
very
substantial
fee
and
i
at
having
no
opportunity
for
applying
my
recently
augmented
knowledge
yes
said
my
colleague
as
we
rolled
ourselves
up
in
our
rugs
in
adjacent
corners
of
the
railway
carriage
it
has
been
a
flat
affair
and
the
whole
thing
could
have
been
managed
by
the
local
solicitor
but
it
is
not
a
waste
of
time
after
all
for
you
see
i
have
to
do
many
a
day
work
for
which
i
get
not
a
farthing
of
payment
nor
even
any
recognition
so
that
i
do
not
complain
if
i
occasionally
find
myself
receiving
more
payment
than
my
actual
services
merit
and
as
to
you
i
take
it
that
you
have
acquired
a
good
deal
of
valuable
knowledge
on
the
subject
of
suicide
and
knowledge
as
the
late
lord
bacon
remarked
with
more
truth
than
originality
is
power
to
this
i
made
no
reply
having
just
lit
my
pipe
and
feeling
uncommonly
drowsy
and
my
companion
having
followed
my
example
we
smoked
in
silence
becoming
more
and
more
somnolent
until
the
train
drew
up
in
the
terminus
and
we
turned
out
yawning
and
shivering
on
to
the
platform
bah
exclaimed
thorndyke
drawing
his
rug
round
his
shoulders
this
is
a
cheerless
hour
a
quarter
past
one
see
how
chilly
and
miserable
all
these
poor
devils
of
passengers
look
shall
we
cab
it
or
walk
i
think
a
sharp
walk
would
rouse
our
circulation
after
sitting
huddled
up
in
the
carriage
for
so
long
i
answered
so
do
i
said
thorndyke
so
let
us
away
hark
forward
and
also
tally
ho
in
fact
one
might
go
so
far
as
to
say
yoicks
that
gentleman
appears
to
favour
the
strenuous
life
if
one
may
judge
by
the
size
of
his
he
pointed
to
a
bicycle
that
was
drawn
up
by
the
kerb
in
the
approach
a
machine
of
the
type
with
an
enormous
indicating
a
gear
of
at
least
ninety
some
scorcher
or
amateur
racer
probably
i
said
who
takes
the
opportunity
of
getting
a
spin
on
the
wood
pavement
when
the
streets
are
empty
i
looked
round
to
see
if
i
could
identify
the
owner
but
the
machine
appeared
to
be
for
the
moment
taking
care
of
itself
cross
is
one
of
those
districts
of
which
the
inhabitants
are
slow
in
settling
down
for
the
night
and
even
at
a
quarter
past
one
in
the
morning
its
streets
are
not
entirely
deserted
here
and
there
the
glimmer
of
a
street
lamp
or
the
ray
from
a
tall
electric
light
reveals
the
form
of
some
nocturnal
prowler
creeping
along
with
stealthiness
or
bursting
into
unmelodious
song
not
greatly
desirous
of
the
society
of
these
roysterers
we
crossed
quickly
from
the
station
into
the
gray
inn
road
now
silent
and
excessively
dismal
in
aspect
and
took
our
way
along
the
western
side
we
had
turned
the
curve
and
were
crossing
manchester
street
when
a
series
of
yelps
from
ahead
announced
the
presence
of
a
party
of
whom
we
were
not
yet
able
to
see
however
for
the
night
was
an
exceptionally
dark
one
but
the
sounds
of
revelry
continued
to
increase
in
volume
as
we
proceeded
until
as
we
passed
sidmouth
street
we
came
in
sight
of
the
revellers
they
were
some
in
number
all
of
them
roughs
of
the
hooligan
type
and
they
were
evidently
in
boisterous
spirits
for
as
they
passed
the
entrance
to
the
royal
free
hospital
they
halted
and
battered
furiously
at
the
gate
shortly
after
this
exploit
they
crossed
the
road
on
to
our
side
whereupon
thorndyke
caught
my
arm
and
slackened
his
pace
let
them
draw
ahead
said
he
it
is
a
wise
precaution
to
give
all
hooligan
gangs
a
very
wide
berth
at
this
time
of
night
we
had
better
turn
down
heathcote
street
and
cross
mecklenburgh
square
we
continued
to
walk
on
at
reduced
speed
until
we
reached
heathcote
street
into
which
we
turned
and
so
entered
mecklenburgh
square
where
we
mended
our
pace
once
more
the
hooligan
pursued
thorndyke
as
we
walked
briskly
across
the
silent
square
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
ranging
from
highway
robbery
with
violence
and
paid
assassination
technically
known
as
down
to
the
criminal
folly
of
the
philanthropic
magistrate
who
seems
to
think
that
his
function
in
the
economy
of
nature
is
to
secure
the
survival
of
the
unfittest
there
goes
a
cyclist
along
guildford
street
i
wonder
if
that
is
our
strenuous
friend
from
the
station
if
so
he
has
slipped
past
the
hooligans
we
were
just
entering
doughty
street
and
as
thorndyke
spoke
a
man
on
a
bicycle
was
visible
for
an
instant
at
the
crossing
of
the
two
streets
when
we
reached
guildford
street
we
both
looked
down
the
long
vista
but
the
cyclist
had
vanished
we
had
better
go
straight
on
into
theobald
road
said
thorndyke
and
we
accordingly
pursued
our
way
up
the
fine
street
from
whose
tall
houses
our
footfalls
echoed
so
that
we
seemed
to
be
accompanied
by
an
invisible
multitude
until
we
reached
that
part
where
it
unaccountably
changes
its
name
and
becomes
john
street
there
always
seems
to
me
something
very
pathetic
about
these
old
bloomsbury
streets
said
thorndyke
with
their
faded
grandeur
and
dignified
seediness
they
remind
me
of
some
prim
and
aged
gentlewoman
in
reduced
circumstances
who
hallo
what
was
that
a
faint
sharp
thud
from
behind
had
been
followed
instantly
by
the
shattering
of
a
window
in
front
we
both
stopped
dead
and
remained
for
a
couple
of
seconds
staring
into
the
gloom
from
whence
the
first
sound
had
come
then
thorndyke
darted
diagonally
across
the
road
at
a
swift
run
and
i
immediately
followed
at
the
moment
when
the
affair
happened
we
had
gone
about
forty
yards
up
john
street
that
is
from
the
place
where
it
is
crossed
by
henry
street
and
we
now
raced
across
the
road
to
the
further
corner
of
the
latter
street
when
we
reached
it
however
the
little
thoroughfare
was
empty
and
as
we
paused
for
a
moment
no
sound
of
retreating
footsteps
broke
the
silence
the
shot
certainly
came
from
here
said
thorndyke
come
on
and
he
again
broke
into
a
run
a
few
yards
up
the
street
a
mews
turns
off
to
the
left
and
into
this
my
companion
plunged
motioning
me
to
go
straight
on
which
i
accordingly
did
and
in
a
few
paces
reached
the
top
of
the
street
here
a
narrow
thoroughfare
with
a
broad
smooth
pavement
bears
off
to
the
left
parallel
with
the
mews
and
as
i
arrived
at
the
corner
and
glanced
up
the
little
street
i
saw
a
man
on
a
bicycle
gliding
swiftly
and
silently
towards
little
james
street
with
a
mighty
shout
of
stop
thief
i
started
in
hot
pursuit
but
though
the
man
feet
were
moving
in
an
apparently
leisurely
manner
he
drew
ahead
at
an
astonishing
pace
in
spite
of
my
efforts
to
overtake
him
and
it
then
dawned
upon
me
that
the
slow
revolutions
of
his
feet
were
due
in
reality
to
the
unusually
high
gear
of
the
machine
that
he
was
riding
as
i
realised
this
and
at
the
same
moment
recalled
the
bicycle
that
we
had
seen
in
the
station
the
fugitive
swung
round
into
little
james
street
and
vanished
the
speed
at
which
the
man
was
travelling
made
further
pursuit
utterly
futile
so
i
turned
and
walked
back
panting
and
perspiring
from
the
unwonted
exertion
as
i
henry
street
thorndyke
emerged
from
the
mews
and
halted
on
seeing
me
cyclist
he
asked
laconically
as
i
came
up
yes
i
answered
riding
a
machine
geared
up
to
about
ninety
ah
he
must
have
followed
us
from
the
station
said
thorndyke
did
you
notice
if
he
was
carrying
anything
he
had
a
in
his
hand
i
did
see
anything
else
what
sort
of
i
could
see
very
distinctly
it
was
a
stoutish
stick
i
should
say
a
malacca
probably
and
it
had
what
looked
like
a
horn
handle
i
could
see
that
as
he
passed
a
street
lamp
what
kind
of
lamp
had
he
i
could
see
but
as
he
turned
the
corner
i
noticed
that
it
seemed
to
burn
very
dimly
a
little
vaseline
or
even
oil
smeared
on
the
outside
of
the
glass
will
reduce
the
glare
of
a
lamp
very
appreciably
my
companion
remarked
especially
on
a
dusty
road
ha
here
is
the
proprietor
of
the
broken
window
he
wants
to
know
you
know
we
had
once
more
turned
into
john
street
and
now
perceived
a
man
standing
on
the
wide
doorstep
of
the
house
with
the
shattered
window
looking
anxiously
up
and
down
the
street
do
either
of
you
gents
know
anything
about
this
here
he
asked
pointing
to
the
broken
pane
yes
said
thorndyke
we
happened
to
be
passing
when
it
was
done
in
fact
he
added
i
rather
suspect
that
the
missile
whatever
it
was
was
intended
for
our
benefit
oh
said
the
man
who
done
it
that
i
ca
say
replied
thorndyke
whoever
he
was
he
made
off
on
a
bicycle
and
we
were
unable
to
catch
him
oh
said
the
man
once
more
regarding
us
with
growing
suspicion
on
a
bicycle
hay
dam
funny
ai
it
what
did
he
do
it
with
that
is
what
i
should
like
to
find
out
said
thorndyke
i
see
this
house
is
empty
yes
it
empty
leastways
it
to
let
i
the
caretaker
but
that
got
to
do
with
it
merely
this
answered
thorndyke
that
the
object
stone
bullet
or
whatever
it
may
have
been
was
aimed
i
believe
at
me
and
i
should
like
to
ascertain
its
nature
would
you
do
me
the
favour
of
permitting
me
to
look
for
it
the
caretaker
was
evidently
inclined
to
refuse
this
request
for
he
glanced
suspiciously
from
my
companion
to
me
once
or
twice
before
replying
but
at
length
he
turned
towards
the
open
door
and
gruffly
invited
us
to
enter
a
paraffin
lamp
was
on
the
floor
in
a
recess
of
the
hall
and
this
our
conductor
took
up
when
he
had
closed
the
street
door
this
is
the
room
he
said
turning
the
key
and
thrusting
the
door
open
the
library
they
call
it
but
it
the
front
parlour
in
plain
english
he
entered
and
holding
the
lamp
above
his
head
stared
balefully
at
the
broken
window
thorndyke
glanced
quickly
along
the
floor
in
the
direction
that
the
missile
would
have
taken
and
then
said
do
you
see
any
mark
on
the
wall
there
as
he
spoke
he
indicated
the
wall
opposite
the
window
which
obviously
could
not
have
been
struck
by
a
projectile
entering
with
such
extreme
obliquity
and
i
was
about
to
point
out
this
fact
when
i
fortunately
remembered
the
great
virtue
of
silence
our
friend
approached
the
wall
still
holding
up
the
lamp
and
scrutinised
the
surface
with
close
attention
and
while
he
was
thus
engaged
i
observed
thorndyke
stoop
quickly
and
pick
up
something
which
he
deposited
carefully
and
without
remark
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
i
do
see
no
bruise
anywhere
said
the
caretaker
sweeping
his
hand
over
the
wall
perhaps
the
thing
struck
this
wall
suggested
thorndyke
pointing
to
the
one
that
was
actually
in
the
line
of
fire
yes
of
course
he
added
it
would
be
this
one
the
shot
came
from
henry
street
the
caretaker
crossed
the
room
and
threw
the
light
of
his
lamp
on
the
wall
thus
indicated
ah
here
we
are
he
exclaimed
with
gloomy
satisfaction
pointing
to
a
small
dent
in
which
the
was
turned
back
and
the
plaster
exposed
looks
almost
like
a
bullet
mark
but
you
say
you
did
hear
no
report
no
said
thorndyke
there
was
no
report
it
must
have
been
a
catapult
the
caretaker
set
the
lamp
down
on
the
floor
and
proceeded
to
grope
about
for
the
projectile
in
which
operation
we
both
assisted
and
i
could
not
suppress
a
faint
smile
as
i
noted
the
earnestness
with
which
thorndyke
peered
about
the
floor
in
search
of
the
missile
that
was
quietly
reposing
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
we
were
deep
in
our
investigations
when
there
was
heard
an
uncompromising
double
knock
at
the
street
door
followed
by
the
loud
pealing
of
a
bell
in
the
basement
bobby
i
suppose
growled
the
caretaker
here
a
blooming
fuss
about
nothing
he
caught
up
the
lamp
and
went
out
leaving
us
in
the
dark
i
picked
it
up
you
know
said
thorndyke
when
we
were
alone
i
saw
you
i
answered
good
i
applaud
your
discretion
he
rejoined
the
supposition
was
correct
when
he
returned
he
was
accompanied
by
a
burly
constable
who
saluted
us
with
a
cheerful
smile
and
glanced
facetiously
round
the
empty
room
our
boys
said
he
nodding
towards
the
broken
window
they
playful
lads
that
they
are
you
were
passing
when
it
happened
sir
i
hear
yes
answered
thorndyke
and
he
gave
the
constable
a
brief
account
of
the
occurrence
which
the
latter
listened
to
notebook
in
hand
well
said
he
when
the
narrative
was
concluded
if
those
hooligan
boys
are
going
to
take
to
catapults
they
make
things
lively
all
round
you
ought
to
run
some
of
in
said
the
caretaker
run
in
exclaimed
the
constable
in
a
tone
of
disgust
yes
and
then
the
magistrate
will
tell
to
be
good
boys
and
give
five
shillings
out
of
the
to
buy
illustrated
testaments
testament
them
the
worthless
varmints
he
rammed
his
notebook
fiercely
into
his
pocket
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
into
the
street
whither
we
followed
you
find
that
bullet
or
stone
when
you
sweep
up
the
room
he
said
as
he
turned
on
to
his
beat
and
you
better
let
us
have
it
good
night
sir
he
strolled
off
towards
henry
street
while
thorndyke
and
i
resumed
our
journey
southward
why
were
you
so
secret
about
that
projectile
i
asked
my
friend
as
we
walked
up
the
street
partly
to
avoid
discussion
with
the
caretaker
he
replied
but
principally
because
i
thought
it
likely
that
a
constable
would
pass
the
house
and
seeing
the
light
come
in
to
make
inquiries
and
then
then
i
should
have
had
to
hand
over
the
object
to
him
and
why
not
is
the
object
a
specially
interesting
one
it
is
highly
interesting
to
me
at
the
present
moment
replied
thorndyke
with
a
chuckle
because
i
have
not
examined
it
i
have
a
theory
as
to
its
nature
which
theory
i
should
like
to
test
before
taking
the
police
into
my
confidence
are
you
going
to
take
me
into
your
confidence
i
asked
when
we
get
home
if
you
are
not
too
sleepy
he
replied
on
our
arrival
at
his
chambers
thorndyke
desired
me
to
light
up
and
clear
one
end
of
the
table
while
he
went
up
to
the
workshop
to
fetch
some
tools
i
turned
back
the
table
cover
and
having
adjusted
the
gas
so
as
to
light
this
part
of
the
table
waited
in
some
impatience
for
my
colleague
return
in
a
few
minutes
he
bearing
a
small
vice
a
metal
saw
and
a
bottle
what
have
you
got
in
that
bottle
i
asked
perceiving
a
metal
object
inside
it
that
is
the
projectile
which
i
have
thought
fit
to
rinse
in
distilled
water
for
reasons
that
will
presently
appear
he
agitated
the
bottle
gently
for
a
minute
or
so
and
then
with
a
pair
of
dissecting
forceps
lifted
out
the
object
and
held
it
above
the
surface
of
the
water
to
drain
after
which
he
laid
it
carefully
on
a
piece
of
i
stooped
over
the
projectile
and
examined
it
with
great
curiosity
while
thorndyke
stood
by
regarding
me
with
almost
equal
interest
well
he
said
after
watching
me
in
silence
for
some
time
what
do
you
see
i
see
a
small
brass
cylinder
i
answered
about
two
inches
long
and
rather
thicker
than
an
ordinary
lead
pencil
one
end
is
conical
and
there
is
a
small
hole
at
the
apex
which
seems
to
contain
a
steel
point
the
other
end
is
flat
but
has
in
the
centre
a
small
square
projection
such
as
might
fit
a
i
notice
also
a
small
hole
in
the
side
of
the
cylinder
close
to
the
flat
end
the
thing
looks
like
a
miniature
shell
and
appears
to
be
hollow
it
is
hollow
said
thorndyke
you
must
have
observed
that
when
i
held
it
up
to
drain
the
water
trickled
out
through
the
hole
at
the
pointed
end
yes
i
noticed
that
now
take
it
up
and
shake
it
i
did
so
and
felt
some
heavy
object
rattle
inside
it
there
is
some
loose
body
inside
it
i
said
which
fits
it
pretty
closely
as
it
moves
only
in
the
long
diameter
quite
so
your
description
is
excellent
and
now
what
is
the
nature
of
this
projectile
i
should
say
it
is
a
miniature
shell
or
explosive
bullet
wrong
said
thorndyke
a
very
natural
inference
but
a
wrong
one
then
what
is
the
thing
i
demanded
my
curiosity
still
further
aroused
i
will
show
you
he
replied
it
is
something
much
more
subtle
than
an
explosive
bullet
which
would
really
be
a
rather
crude
appliance
admirably
thought
out
and
thoroughly
well
executed
we
have
to
deal
with
a
most
ingenious
and
capable
man
i
was
fain
to
laugh
at
his
enthusiastic
appreciation
of
the
methods
of
his
assassin
and
the
humour
of
the
situation
then
appeared
to
dawn
on
him
for
he
said
with
an
apologetic
smile
i
am
not
expressing
approval
you
must
understand
but
merely
professional
admiration
it
is
this
class
of
criminal
that
creates
the
necessity
for
my
services
he
is
my
patron
so
to
speak
my
ultimate
employer
for
the
common
crook
can
be
dealt
with
quite
efficiently
by
the
common
policeman
while
he
was
speaking
he
had
been
fitting
the
little
cylinder
between
two
pads
of
in
the
vice
which
he
now
screwed
up
tight
then
with
the
fine
metal
saw
he
began
to
cut
the
projectile
lengthwise
into
two
slightly
unequal
parts
this
operation
took
some
time
especially
since
he
was
careful
not
to
cut
the
loose
body
inside
but
at
length
the
section
was
completed
and
the
interior
of
the
cylinder
exposed
when
he
released
it
from
the
vice
and
held
it
up
before
me
with
an
expression
of
triumph
now
what
do
you
make
it
he
demanded
i
took
the
object
in
my
fingers
and
looked
at
it
closely
but
was
at
first
more
puzzled
than
before
the
loose
body
i
now
saw
to
be
a
cylinder
of
lead
about
half
an
inch
long
accurately
fitting
the
inside
of
the
cylinder
but
capable
of
slipping
freely
backwards
and
forwards
the
steel
point
which
i
had
noticed
in
the
hole
at
the
apex
of
the
conical
end
was
now
seen
to
be
the
pointed
termination
of
a
slender
steel
rod
which
projected
fully
an
inch
into
the
cavity
of
the
cylinder
and
the
conical
end
itself
was
a
solid
mass
of
lead
well
queried
thorndyke
seeing
that
i
was
still
silent
you
tell
me
it
is
not
an
explosive
bullet
i
replied
otherwise
i
should
have
been
confirmed
in
that
opinion
i
should
have
said
that
the
percussion
cap
was
carried
by
this
lead
plunger
and
struck
on
the
end
of
that
steel
rod
when
the
flight
of
the
bullet
was
suddenly
arrested
very
good
indeed
said
thorndyke
you
are
right
so
far
that
this
is
in
fact
the
mechanism
of
a
percussion
shell
but
look
at
this
you
see
this
little
rod
was
driven
inside
the
bullet
when
the
latter
struck
the
wall
let
us
replace
it
in
its
original
position
he
laid
the
end
of
a
small
flat
file
against
the
end
of
the
rod
and
pressed
it
firmly
when
the
rod
slid
through
the
hole
until
it
projected
an
inch
beyond
the
apex
of
the
cone
then
he
handed
the
projectile
back
to
me
a
single
glance
at
the
point
of
the
steel
rod
made
the
whole
thing
clear
and
i
gave
a
whistle
of
consternation
for
the
rod
was
a
fine
tube
with
a
sharply
pointed
end
the
infernal
scoundrel
i
exclaimed
it
is
a
hypodermic
needle
yes
a
veterinary
hypodermic
of
extra
large
bore
now
you
see
the
subtlety
and
ingenuity
of
the
whole
thing
if
he
had
had
a
reasonable
chance
he
would
certainly
have
succeeded
you
speak
quite
regretfully
i
said
laughing
again
at
the
oddity
of
his
attitude
towards
the
assassin
not
at
all
he
replied
i
have
the
character
of
a
player
but
even
the
most
man
can
hardly
make
a
on
himself
i
am
merely
appreciating
an
admirable
piece
of
mechanical
design
most
efficiently
carried
out
observe
the
completeness
of
the
thing
and
the
way
in
which
all
the
necessities
of
the
case
are
foreseen
and
met
this
projectile
was
discharged
from
a
powerful
the
form
provided
with
a
and
key
the
barrel
of
that
gun
was
rifled
how
do
you
know
that
i
asked
well
to
begin
with
it
would
be
useless
to
fit
a
needle
to
the
projectile
unless
the
latter
was
made
to
travel
with
the
point
forwards
but
there
is
direct
evidence
that
the
barrel
was
rifled
you
notice
the
little
square
projection
on
the
back
surface
of
the
cylinder
that
was
evidently
made
to
fit
a
washer
or
wad
probably
a
thin
plate
of
soft
metal
which
would
be
driven
by
the
pressure
from
behind
into
the
grooves
of
the
rifling
and
thus
give
a
spinning
motion
to
the
bullet
when
the
latter
left
the
barrel
the
wad
would
drop
off
leaving
it
free
i
see
i
was
wondering
what
the
square
projection
was
for
it
is
as
you
say
extremely
ingenious
highly
ingenious
said
thorndyke
enthusiastically
and
so
is
the
whole
device
see
how
perfectly
it
would
have
worked
but
for
a
mere
fluke
and
for
the
complication
of
your
presence
supposing
that
i
had
been
alone
so
that
he
could
have
approached
to
a
shorter
distance
in
that
case
he
would
not
have
missed
and
the
thing
would
have
been
done
you
see
how
it
was
intended
to
be
done
i
suppose
i
think
so
i
answered
but
i
should
like
to
hear
your
account
of
the
process
well
you
see
he
first
finds
out
that
i
am
returning
by
a
late
train
which
he
seems
to
have
done
and
he
waits
for
me
at
the
terminus
meanwhile
he
fills
the
cylinder
with
a
solution
of
a
powerful
alkaloidal
poison
which
is
easily
done
by
dipping
the
needle
into
the
liquid
and
sucking
at
the
small
hole
near
the
back
end
when
the
piston
will
be
drawn
up
and
the
liquid
will
follow
it
you
notice
that
the
upper
side
of
the
piston
is
covered
with
vaseline
introduced
through
the
hole
no
doubt
which
would
prevent
the
poison
from
coming
out
into
the
mouth
and
make
the
cylinder
secure
from
leakage
on
my
arrival
he
follows
me
on
his
bicycle
until
i
pass
through
a
sufficiently
secluded
neighbourhood
then
he
approaches
me
or
passes
me
and
waits
round
a
corner
and
shoots
at
pretty
close
range
it
does
matter
where
he
hits
me
all
parts
are
equally
vital
so
he
can
aim
at
the
middle
of
my
back
then
the
bullet
comes
spinning
through
the
air
point
foremost
the
needle
passes
through
the
clothing
and
enters
the
flesh
and
as
the
bullet
is
suddenly
stopped
the
heavy
piston
flies
down
by
its
own
great
momentum
and
squirts
out
a
jet
of
the
poison
into
the
tissues
the
bullet
then
disengages
itself
and
drops
on
to
the
ground
meanwhile
our
friend
has
mounted
his
bicycle
and
is
off
and
when
i
feel
the
prick
of
the
needle
i
turn
and
without
stopping
to
look
for
the
bullet
immediately
give
chase
i
am
of
course
not
able
to
overtake
a
man
on
a
racing
machine
but
still
i
follow
him
some
distance
then
the
poison
begins
to
take
effect
the
more
rapidly
from
the
violent
exercise
and
presently
i
drop
insensible
later
on
my
body
is
found
there
are
no
marks
of
violence
and
probably
the
escapes
observation
at
the
in
which
case
the
verdict
will
be
death
from
even
if
the
poison
and
the
puncture
are
discovered
there
is
no
clue
the
bullet
lies
some
streets
away
and
is
probably
picked
up
by
some
boy
or
passing
stranger
who
can
not
conjecture
its
use
and
who
would
never
connect
it
with
the
man
who
was
found
dead
you
will
admit
that
the
whole
plan
has
been
worked
out
with
surprising
completeness
and
foresight
yes
i
answered
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
fellow
is
a
most
infernally
clever
scoundrel
may
i
ask
if
you
have
any
idea
who
he
is
well
thorndyke
replied
seeing
that
as
carlyle
has
unkindly
pointed
out
clever
people
are
not
in
an
overwhelming
majority
and
that
of
the
clever
people
whom
i
know
only
a
very
few
are
interested
in
my
immediate
demise
i
am
able
to
form
a
fairly
probable
conjecture
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
for
the
present
i
shall
maintain
an
attitude
of
masterly
inactivity
and
avoid
the
night
air
but
surely
i
exclaimed
you
will
take
some
measures
to
protect
yourself
against
attempts
of
this
kind
you
can
hardly
doubt
now
that
your
accident
in
the
fog
was
really
an
attempted
murder
i
never
did
doubt
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
although
i
prevaricated
at
the
time
but
i
have
not
enough
evidence
against
this
man
at
present
and
consequently
can
do
nothing
but
show
that
i
suspect
him
which
would
be
foolish
whereas
if
i
lie
low
one
of
two
things
will
happen
either
the
occasion
for
my
removal
which
is
only
a
temporary
one
will
pass
or
he
will
commit
himself
will
put
a
definite
clue
into
my
hands
then
we
shall
find
the
the
bicycle
perhaps
a
little
stock
of
poison
and
certain
other
trifles
that
i
have
in
my
mind
which
will
be
good
confirmatory
evidence
though
insufficient
in
themselves
and
now
i
think
i
must
really
adjourn
this
meeting
or
we
shall
be
good
for
nothing
chapter
xii
it
might
have
been
it
was
now
only
a
week
from
the
date
on
which
the
trial
was
to
open
in
eight
days
the
mystery
would
almost
certainly
be
solved
if
it
was
capable
of
solution
for
the
trial
promised
to
be
quite
a
short
one
and
then
reuben
hornby
would
be
either
a
convicted
felon
or
a
free
man
clear
of
the
stigma
of
the
crime
for
several
days
past
thorndyke
had
been
in
almost
constant
possession
of
the
laboratory
while
his
own
small
room
devoted
ordinarily
to
bacteriology
and
microscopical
work
was
kept
continually
locked
a
state
of
things
that
reduced
polton
to
a
condition
of
the
most
extreme
nervous
irritation
especially
when
as
he
told
me
indignantly
he
met
anstey
emerging
from
the
holy
of
holies
grinning
and
rubbing
his
hands
and
giving
utterance
to
genial
but
unparliamentary
expressions
of
amused
satisfaction
i
had
met
anstey
on
several
occasions
lately
and
each
time
liked
him
better
than
the
last
for
his
whimsical
facetious
manner
covered
a
nature
as
it
often
does
that
was
serious
and
thoughtful
and
i
found
him
not
only
a
man
of
considerable
learning
but
one
also
of
a
lofty
standard
of
conduct
his
admiration
for
thorndyke
was
unbounded
and
i
could
see
that
the
two
men
collaborated
with
the
utmost
sympathy
and
mutual
satisfaction
but
although
i
regarded
anstey
with
feelings
of
the
liveliest
friendship
i
was
far
from
gratified
when
on
the
morning
of
which
i
am
writing
i
observed
him
from
our
window
crossing
the
gravelled
space
from
crown
office
row
and
evidently
bearing
down
on
our
chambers
for
the
fact
is
that
i
was
awaiting
the
arrival
of
juliet
and
should
greatly
have
preferred
to
be
alone
at
the
moment
seeing
that
thorndyke
had
already
gone
out
it
is
true
that
my
fair
enslaver
was
not
due
for
nearly
but
then
who
could
say
how
long
anstey
would
stay
or
what
embarrassments
might
arise
from
my
efforts
to
escape
by
all
of
which
it
may
be
perceived
that
my
disease
had
reached
a
very
advanced
stage
and
that
i
was
unequal
to
those
tactics
of
concealment
that
are
commonly
attributed
to
the
ostrich
a
sharp
rap
of
the
knocker
announced
the
arrival
of
the
disturber
of
my
peace
and
when
i
opened
the
door
anstey
walked
in
with
the
air
of
a
man
to
whom
an
hour
more
or
less
is
of
no
consequence
whatever
he
shook
my
hand
with
mock
solemnity
and
seating
himself
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
proceeded
to
roll
a
cigarette
with
exasperating
deliberation
i
infer
said
he
that
our
learned
brother
is
practising
parlour
magic
upstairs
or
peradventure
he
has
gone
on
a
journey
he
has
a
consultation
this
morning
i
answered
was
he
expecting
you
evidently
not
or
he
would
have
been
here
no
i
just
looked
in
to
ask
a
question
about
the
case
of
your
friend
hornby
you
know
it
comes
on
for
trial
next
week
yes
thorndyke
told
me
what
do
you
think
of
hornby
prospects
is
he
going
to
be
convicted
or
will
he
get
an
acquittal
will
be
entirely
passive
replied
anstey
but
here
he
slapped
his
chest
impressively
are
going
to
secure
an
acquittal
you
will
be
highly
entertained
my
learned
friend
and
mr
the
enemy
will
be
excessively
surprised
he
inspected
the
cigarette
with
a
critical
air
and
chuckled
softly
you
seem
pretty
confident
i
remarked
i
am
he
answered
though
thorndyke
considers
failure
possible
which
of
course
it
is
if
the
should
chance
to
be
filled
with
microcephalic
idiots
and
the
judge
should
prove
incapable
of
understanding
simple
technical
evidence
but
we
hope
that
neither
of
these
things
will
happen
and
if
they
do
not
we
feel
pretty
safe
by
the
way
i
hope
i
am
not
divulging
your
principal
secrets
well
i
replied
with
a
smile
you
have
been
more
explicit
than
thorndyke
ever
has
have
i
he
exclaimed
with
mock
anxiety
then
i
must
swear
you
to
secrecy
thorndyke
is
so
very
close
and
he
is
quite
right
too
i
never
cease
admiring
his
tactics
of
allowing
the
enemy
to
fortify
and
barricade
the
entrance
that
he
does
mean
to
attack
but
i
see
you
are
wishing
me
at
the
devil
so
give
me
a
cigar
and
i
will
go
though
not
to
that
particular
destination
will
you
have
one
of
thorndyke
special
brand
i
asked
malignantly
what
those
foul
trichinopolies
not
while
brown
paper
is
to
be
obtained
at
every
stationer
i
sooner
smoke
my
own
wig
i
tendered
my
own
case
from
which
he
selected
a
cigar
with
anxious
care
and
much
sniffing
then
he
bade
me
a
ceremonious
adieu
and
departed
down
the
stairs
blithely
humming
a
melody
from
the
latest
comic
opera
he
had
not
left
more
than
five
minutes
when
a
soft
and
elaborate
from
the
little
brass
knocker
brought
my
heart
into
my
mouth
i
ran
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
revealing
juliet
standing
on
the
threshold
may
i
come
in
she
asked
i
want
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
before
we
start
i
looked
at
her
with
some
anxiety
for
she
was
manifestly
agitated
and
the
hand
that
she
held
out
to
me
trembled
i
am
greatly
upset
jervis
she
said
ignoring
the
chair
that
i
had
placed
for
her
lawley
has
been
giving
us
his
views
of
poor
reuben
case
and
his
attitude
fills
me
with
dismay
hang
mr
lawley
i
muttered
and
then
apologised
hastily
what
made
you
go
to
him
miss
gibson
i
did
go
to
him
he
came
to
us
he
dined
with
us
last
night
he
and
walter
and
his
manner
was
gloomy
in
the
extreme
after
dinner
walter
took
him
apart
with
me
and
asked
him
what
he
really
thought
of
the
case
he
was
most
pessimistic
dear
sir
he
said
only
advice
i
can
give
you
is
that
you
prepare
yourself
to
contemplate
disaster
as
philosophically
as
you
can
in
my
opinion
your
cousin
is
almost
certain
to
be
convicted
said
walter
about
the
defence
i
understood
that
there
was
at
least
a
plausible
case
lawley
shrugged
his
shoulders
have
a
sort
of
that
will
go
for
nothing
but
i
have
no
evidence
to
offer
in
answer
to
that
of
the
prosecution
and
no
case
and
i
may
say
speaking
in
confidence
that
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
case
i
do
not
see
how
there
can
be
any
case
and
i
have
heard
nothing
from
thorndyke
to
lead
me
to
suppose
that
he
has
really
done
anything
in
the
matter
is
this
true
jervis
oh
do
tell
me
the
real
truth
about
it
i
have
been
so
miserable
and
terrified
since
i
heard
this
and
i
was
so
full
of
hope
before
tell
me
is
it
true
will
reuben
be
sent
to
prison
after
all
in
her
agitation
she
laid
her
hands
on
my
arm
and
looked
up
into
my
face
with
her
grey
eyes
swimming
with
tears
and
was
so
piteous
so
trustful
and
withal
so
bewitching
that
my
reserve
melted
like
snow
before
a
july
sun
it
is
not
true
i
answered
taking
her
hands
in
mine
and
speaking
perforce
in
a
low
tone
that
i
might
not
betray
my
emotion
if
it
were
it
would
mean
that
i
have
wilfully
deceived
you
that
i
have
been
false
to
our
friendship
and
how
much
that
friendship
has
been
to
me
no
one
but
myself
will
ever
know
she
crept
a
little
closer
to
me
with
a
manner
at
once
penitent
and
wheedling
you
are
not
going
to
be
angry
with
me
are
you
it
was
foolish
of
me
to
listen
to
lawley
after
all
you
have
told
me
and
it
did
look
like
a
want
of
trust
in
you
i
know
but
you
who
are
so
strong
and
wise
must
make
allowance
for
a
woman
who
is
neither
it
is
all
so
terrible
that
i
am
quite
unstrung
but
say
you
are
not
really
displeased
with
me
for
that
would
hurt
me
most
of
all
oh
delilah
that
concluding
stroke
of
the
shears
severed
the
very
last
lock
and
left
me
morally
speaking
as
bald
as
a
billiard
ball
henceforth
i
was
at
her
mercy
and
would
have
divulged
without
a
scruple
the
uttermost
secrets
of
my
principal
but
that
that
astute
gentleman
had
placed
me
beyond
the
reach
of
temptation
as
to
being
angry
with
you
i
answered
i
am
not
like
thorndyke
one
to
essay
the
impossible
and
if
i
could
be
angry
it
would
hurt
me
more
than
it
would
you
but
in
fact
you
are
not
to
blame
at
all
and
i
am
an
egotistical
brute
of
course
you
were
alarmed
and
distressed
nothing
could
be
more
natural
so
now
let
me
try
to
chase
away
your
fears
and
restore
your
confidence
i
have
told
you
what
thorndyke
said
to
reuben
that
he
had
good
hopes
of
making
his
innocence
clear
to
everybody
that
alone
should
have
been
enough
i
know
it
should
murmured
juliet
remorsefully
please
forgive
me
for
my
want
of
faith
but
i
continued
i
can
quote
you
the
words
of
one
to
whose
opinions
you
will
attach
more
weight
anstey
was
here
less
than
ago
do
you
mean
reuben
counsel
yes
and
what
did
he
say
oh
do
tell
me
what
he
said
he
said
in
brief
that
he
was
quite
confident
of
obtaining
an
acquittal
and
that
the
prosecution
would
receive
a
great
surprise
he
seemed
highly
pleased
with
his
brief
and
spoke
with
great
admiration
of
thorndyke
did
he
really
say
that
that
he
was
confident
of
an
acquittal
her
voice
was
breathless
and
unsteady
and
she
was
clearly
as
she
had
said
quite
unstrung
what
a
relief
it
is
she
murmured
incoherently
and
so
very
very
kind
of
you
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
laughed
a
queer
shaky
little
laugh
then
quite
suddenly
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
sobbing
hardly
conscious
of
what
i
did
i
drew
her
gently
towards
me
and
rested
her
head
on
my
shoulder
whilst
i
whispered
into
her
ear
i
know
not
what
words
of
consolation
but
i
am
sure
that
i
called
her
dear
juliet
and
probably
used
other
expressions
equally
improper
and
reprehensible
presently
she
recovered
herself
and
having
dried
her
eyes
regarded
me
somewhat
shamefacedly
blushing
hotly
but
smiling
very
sweetly
nevertheless
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
she
said
coming
here
and
weeping
on
your
bosom
like
a
great
baby
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
your
other
clients
do
not
behave
in
this
way
whereat
we
both
laughed
heartily
and
our
emotional
equilibrium
being
thus
restored
we
began
to
think
of
the
object
of
our
meeting
i
am
afraid
i
have
wasted
a
great
deal
of
time
said
juliet
looking
at
her
watch
shall
we
be
too
late
do
you
think
i
hope
not
i
replied
for
reuben
will
be
looking
for
us
but
we
must
hurry
i
caught
up
my
hat
and
we
went
forth
closing
the
oak
behind
us
and
took
our
way
up
king
bench
walk
in
silence
but
with
a
new
and
delightful
sense
of
intimate
comradeship
i
glanced
from
time
to
time
at
my
companion
and
noted
that
her
cheek
still
bore
a
rosy
flush
and
when
she
looked
at
me
there
was
a
sparkle
in
her
eye
and
a
smiling
softness
in
her
glance
that
stirred
my
heart
until
i
trembled
with
the
intensity
of
the
passion
that
i
must
needs
conceal
and
even
while
i
was
feeling
that
i
must
tell
her
all
and
have
done
with
it
tell
her
that
i
was
her
abject
slave
and
she
my
goddess
my
queen
that
in
the
face
of
such
a
love
as
mine
no
man
could
have
any
claim
upon
her
even
then
there
arose
the
still
small
voice
that
began
to
call
me
an
unfaithful
steward
and
to
remind
me
of
a
duty
and
trust
that
were
sacred
even
beyond
love
in
fleet
street
i
hailed
a
cab
and
as
i
took
my
seat
beside
my
fair
companion
the
voice
began
to
wax
and
speak
in
bolder
and
sterner
accents
christopher
jervis
it
said
what
is
this
that
you
are
doing
are
you
a
man
of
honour
or
nought
but
a
mean
pitiful
blackguard
you
the
trusted
agent
of
this
poor
misused
gentleman
are
you
not
planning
in
your
black
heart
how
you
shall
rob
him
of
that
which
if
he
is
a
man
at
all
must
be
more
to
him
than
his
liberty
or
even
his
honour
shame
on
you
for
a
miserable
weakling
have
done
with
these
philanderings
and
keep
your
covenants
like
a
gentleman
or
at
least
an
honest
man
at
this
point
in
my
meditations
juliet
turned
towards
me
with
a
coaxing
smile
my
legal
adviser
seems
to
be
revolving
some
deep
and
weighty
matter
she
said
i
pulled
myself
together
and
looked
at
her
at
her
sparkling
eyes
and
rosy
dimpling
cheeks
so
winsome
and
lovely
and
lovable
come
i
thought
i
must
put
an
end
to
this
at
once
or
i
am
lost
but
it
cost
me
a
very
agony
of
effort
to
do
it
which
agony
i
trust
may
be
duly
set
to
my
account
by
those
who
may
sit
in
judgement
on
me
your
legal
adviser
miss
gibson
i
said
and
at
that
miss
gibson
i
thought
she
looked
at
me
a
little
queerly
has
been
reflecting
that
he
has
acted
considerably
beyond
his
jurisdiction
in
what
respect
she
asked
in
passing
on
to
you
information
which
was
given
to
him
in
very
strict
confidence
and
in
fact
with
an
implied
promise
of
secrecy
on
his
part
but
the
information
was
not
of
a
very
secret
character
was
it
more
so
than
it
appeared
you
see
thorndyke
thinks
it
so
important
not
to
let
the
prosecution
suspect
that
he
has
anything
up
his
sleeve
that
he
has
kept
even
lawley
in
the
dark
and
he
has
never
said
as
much
to
me
as
anstey
did
this
morning
and
now
you
are
sorry
you
told
me
you
think
i
have
led
you
into
a
breach
of
trust
is
it
not
so
she
spoke
without
a
trace
of
petulance
and
her
tone
of
dignified
made
me
feel
a
veritable
worm
my
dear
miss
gibson
i
expostulated
you
entirely
misunderstand
me
i
am
not
in
the
least
sorry
that
i
told
you
how
could
i
have
done
otherwise
under
the
circumstances
but
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
have
taken
the
responsibility
of
communicating
to
you
what
is
really
a
professional
secret
and
that
you
are
to
consider
it
as
such
that
was
how
i
understood
it
replied
juliet
and
you
may
rely
upon
me
not
to
utter
a
syllable
on
the
subject
to
anyone
i
thanked
her
for
this
promise
and
then
by
way
of
making
conversation
gave
her
an
account
in
detail
of
anstey
visit
not
even
omitting
the
incident
of
the
cigar
and
are
thorndyke
cigars
so
extraordinarily
bad
she
asked
not
at
all
i
replied
only
they
are
not
to
every
man
taste
the
trichinopoly
cheroot
is
thorndyke
one
dissipation
and
i
must
say
he
takes
it
very
temperately
under
ordinary
circumstances
he
smokes
a
pipe
but
after
a
specially
heavy
day
work
or
on
any
occasion
of
festivity
or
rejoicing
he
indulges
in
a
trichinopoly
and
he
smokes
the
very
best
that
can
be
got
so
even
the
greatest
men
have
their
weaknesses
juliet
moralised
but
i
wish
i
had
known
thorndyke
sooner
for
hornby
had
a
large
box
of
trichinopoly
cheroots
given
to
him
and
i
believe
they
were
exceptionally
fine
ones
however
he
tried
one
and
did
like
it
so
he
transferred
the
whole
consignment
to
walter
who
smokes
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
cigars
so
we
talked
on
from
one
commonplace
to
another
and
each
more
conventional
than
the
last
in
my
nervousness
i
overdid
my
part
and
having
broken
the
ice
proceeded
to
smash
it
to
impalpable
fragments
endeavouring
merely
to
be
unemotional
and
to
avoid
undue
intimacy
of
manner
i
swung
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
became
almost
stiff
and
perhaps
the
more
so
since
i
was
writhing
with
the
agony
of
repression
meanwhile
a
corresponding
change
took
place
in
my
companion
at
first
her
manner
seemed
doubtful
and
bewildered
then
she
too
grew
more
distant
and
polite
and
less
disposed
for
conversation
perhaps
her
conscience
began
to
rebuke
her
or
it
may
be
that
my
coolness
suggested
to
her
that
her
conduct
had
not
been
quite
of
the
kind
that
would
have
commended
itself
to
reuben
but
however
that
may
have
been
we
continued
to
draw
farther
and
farther
apart
and
in
that
short
we
retraced
the
steps
of
our
growing
friendship
to
such
purpose
that
when
we
descended
from
the
cab
at
the
prison
gate
we
seemed
more
like
strangers
than
on
the
first
day
that
we
met
it
was
a
miserable
ending
to
all
our
delightful
comradeship
and
yet
what
other
end
could
one
expect
in
this
world
of
cross
purposes
and
things
that
might
have
been
in
the
extremity
of
my
wretchedness
i
could
have
wept
on
the
bosom
of
the
portly
warder
who
opened
the
wicket
even
as
juliet
had
wept
upon
mine
and
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
me
when
our
brief
visit
was
over
to
find
that
we
should
not
return
together
to
king
cross
as
was
our
wont
but
that
juliet
would
go
back
by
omnibus
that
she
might
do
some
shopping
in
oxford
street
leaving
me
to
walk
home
alone
i
saw
her
into
her
omnibus
and
stood
on
the
pavement
looking
wistfully
at
the
lumbering
vehicle
as
it
dwindled
in
the
distance
at
last
with
a
sigh
of
deepest
despondency
i
turned
my
face
homeward
and
walking
like
one
in
a
dream
retraced
the
route
over
which
i
had
journeyed
so
often
of
late
and
with
such
different
sensations
chapter
xiii
murder
by
post
the
next
few
days
were
perhaps
the
most
unhappy
that
i
have
known
my
life
indeed
since
i
had
left
the
hospital
had
been
one
of
many
disappointments
and
much
privation
unfulfilled
desires
and
ambitions
unrealised
had
combined
with
distaste
for
the
daily
drudgery
that
had
fallen
to
my
lot
to
embitter
my
poverty
and
cause
me
to
look
with
gloomy
distrust
upon
the
unpromising
future
but
no
sorrow
that
i
had
hitherto
experienced
could
compare
with
the
grief
that
i
now
felt
in
contemplating
the
irretrievable
ruin
of
what
i
knew
to
be
the
great
passion
of
my
life
for
to
a
man
like
myself
of
few
friends
and
deep
affections
one
great
emotional
upheaval
exhausts
the
possibilities
of
nature
leaving
only
the
capacity
for
feeble
and
ineffective
echoes
the
edifice
of
love
that
is
raised
upon
the
ruins
of
a
great
passion
can
compare
with
the
original
no
more
than
can
the
paltry
mosque
that
perches
upon
the
mound
of
jonah
with
the
glories
of
the
palace
that
lies
entombed
beneath
i
had
made
a
pretext
to
write
to
juliet
and
had
received
a
reply
quite
frank
and
friendly
in
tone
by
which
i
knew
that
she
had
not
as
some
women
would
have
done
set
the
blame
upon
me
for
our
temporary
outburst
of
emotion
and
yet
there
was
a
subtle
difference
from
her
previous
manner
of
writing
that
only
emphasised
the
finality
of
our
separation
i
think
thorndyke
perceived
that
something
had
gone
awry
though
i
was
at
great
pains
to
maintain
a
cheerful
exterior
and
keep
myself
occupied
and
he
probably
formed
a
pretty
shrewd
guess
at
the
nature
of
the
trouble
but
he
said
nothing
and
i
only
judged
that
he
had
observed
some
change
in
my
manner
by
the
fact
that
there
was
blended
with
his
usual
quiet
geniality
an
almost
insensible
note
of
sympathy
and
affection
a
couple
of
days
after
my
last
interview
with
juliet
an
event
occurred
which
served
certainly
to
relieve
the
tension
and
distract
my
thoughts
though
not
in
a
very
agreeable
manner
it
was
the
pleasant
reposeful
hour
after
dinner
when
it
was
our
custom
to
sit
in
our
respective
easy
chairs
and
as
we
smoked
our
pipes
discuss
some
of
the
many
topics
in
which
we
had
a
common
interest
the
postman
had
just
discharged
into
the
capacious
an
avalanche
of
letters
and
circulars
and
as
i
sat
glancing
through
the
solitary
letter
that
had
fallen
to
my
share
i
looked
from
time
to
time
at
thorndyke
and
noticed
as
i
had
often
done
before
with
some
surprise
a
curious
habit
that
he
had
of
turning
over
and
closely
scrutinising
every
letter
and
package
before
he
opened
it
i
observe
thorndyke
i
now
ventured
to
remark
that
you
always
examine
the
outside
of
a
letter
before
looking
at
the
inside
i
have
seen
other
people
do
the
same
and
it
has
always
appeared
to
me
a
singularly
foolish
proceeding
why
speculate
over
an
unopened
letter
when
a
glance
at
the
contents
will
tell
you
all
there
is
to
know
you
are
perfectly
right
he
answered
if
the
object
of
the
inspection
is
to
discover
who
is
the
sender
of
the
letter
but
that
is
not
my
object
in
my
case
the
habit
is
one
that
has
been
deliberately
cultivated
not
in
reference
to
letters
only
but
to
everything
that
comes
into
my
hands
the
habit
of
allowing
nothing
to
pass
without
a
certain
amount
of
conscious
attention
the
observant
man
is
in
reality
the
attentive
man
and
the
power
of
observation
is
simply
the
capacity
for
continuous
attention
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
found
in
practice
that
the
habit
is
a
useful
one
even
in
reference
to
letters
more
than
once
i
have
gleaned
a
hint
from
the
outside
of
a
letter
that
has
proved
valuable
when
applied
to
the
contents
here
for
instance
is
a
letter
which
has
been
opened
after
being
fastened
up
apparently
by
the
aid
of
steam
the
envelope
is
soiled
and
rubbed
and
smells
faintly
of
stale
tobacco
and
has
evidently
been
carried
in
a
pocket
along
with
a
pipe
why
should
it
have
been
opened
on
reading
it
i
perceive
that
it
should
have
reached
me
two
days
ago
and
that
the
date
has
been
skilfully
altered
from
the
thirteenth
to
the
fifteenth
the
inference
is
that
my
correspondent
has
a
highly
untrustworthy
clerk
but
the
correspondent
may
have
carried
the
letter
in
his
own
pocket
i
objected
hardly
replied
thorndyke
he
would
not
have
troubled
to
steam
his
own
letter
open
and
close
it
again
he
would
have
cut
the
envelope
and
addressed
a
fresh
one
this
the
clerk
could
not
do
because
the
letter
was
confidential
and
was
addressed
in
the
principal
handwriting
and
the
principal
would
have
almost
certainly
added
a
postscript
and
moreover
he
does
not
smoke
this
however
is
all
very
obvious
but
here
is
something
rather
more
subtle
which
i
have
put
aside
for
more
detailed
examination
what
do
you
make
of
it
he
handed
me
a
small
parcel
to
which
was
attached
by
string
a
typewritten
address
label
the
back
of
which
bore
the
printed
inscription
james
bartlett
and
sons
cigar
manufacturers
london
and
havana
i
am
afraid
said
i
after
turning
the
little
packet
over
and
examining
every
part
of
it
minutely
that
this
is
rather
too
subtle
for
me
the
only
thing
that
i
observe
is
that
the
typewriter
has
bungled
the
address
considerably
otherwise
this
seems
to
me
a
very
ordinary
packet
indeed
well
you
have
observed
one
point
of
interest
at
any
rate
said
thorndyke
taking
the
packet
from
me
but
let
us
examine
the
thing
systematically
and
note
down
what
we
see
in
the
first
place
you
will
notice
that
the
label
is
an
ordinary
luggage
label
such
as
you
may
buy
at
any
stationer
with
its
own
string
attached
now
manufacturers
commonly
use
a
different
and
more
substantial
pattern
which
is
attached
by
the
string
of
the
parcel
but
that
is
a
small
matter
what
is
much
more
striking
is
the
address
on
the
label
it
is
typewritten
and
as
you
say
typed
very
badly
do
you
know
anything
about
typewriters
very
little
then
you
do
not
recognise
the
machine
well
this
label
was
typed
with
a
blickensderfer
an
excellent
machine
but
not
the
form
most
commonly
selected
for
the
rough
work
of
a
manufacturer
office
but
we
will
let
that
pass
the
important
point
is
this
the
blickensderfer
company
make
several
forms
of
machine
the
smallest
and
lightest
of
which
is
the
literary
specially
designed
for
the
use
of
journalists
and
men
of
letters
now
this
label
was
typed
with
the
literary
machine
or
at
least
with
the
literary
typewheel
which
is
really
a
very
remarkable
circumstance
indeed
how
do
you
know
that
i
asked
by
this
asterisk
which
has
been
written
by
mistake
the
inexpert
operator
having
pressed
down
the
figure
lever
instead
of
the
one
for
capitals
the
literary
typewheel
is
the
only
one
that
has
an
asterisk
as
i
noticed
when
i
was
thinking
of
purchasing
a
machine
here
then
we
have
a
very
striking
fact
for
even
if
a
manufacturer
chose
to
use
a
in
his
factory
it
is
inconceivable
that
he
should
select
the
literary
form
in
preference
to
the
more
suitable
machine
yes
i
agreed
it
is
certainly
very
singular
and
now
pursued
thorndyke
to
consider
the
writing
itself
it
has
been
done
by
an
absolute
beginner
he
has
failed
to
space
in
two
places
he
has
written
five
wrong
letters
and
he
has
written
figures
instead
of
capitals
in
two
instances
yes
he
has
made
a
shocking
muddle
of
it
i
wonder
he
did
throw
the
label
away
and
type
another
precisely
said
thorndyke
and
if
we
wish
to
find
out
why
he
did
not
we
have
only
to
look
at
the
back
of
the
label
you
see
that
the
name
of
the
firm
instead
of
being
printed
on
the
label
itself
in
the
usual
manner
is
printed
on
a
separate
slip
of
paper
which
is
pasted
on
the
label
a
most
foolish
and
clumsy
arrangement
involving
an
immense
waste
of
time
but
if
we
look
closely
at
the
printed
slip
itself
we
perceive
something
still
more
remarkable
for
that
slip
has
been
cut
down
to
fit
the
label
and
has
been
cut
with
a
pair
of
scissors
the
edges
are
not
quite
straight
and
in
one
place
the
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
cut
made
with
scissors
can
be
seen
quite
plainly
he
handed
the
packet
to
me
with
a
through
which
i
could
distinctly
make
out
the
points
he
had
mentioned
now
i
need
not
point
out
to
you
he
continued
that
these
slips
would
ordinarily
have
been
trimmed
by
the
printer
to
the
correct
size
in
his
machine
which
would
leave
an
absolutely
true
edge
nor
need
i
say
that
no
sane
business
man
would
adopt
such
a
device
as
this
the
slip
of
paper
has
been
cut
with
scissors
to
fit
the
label
and
it
has
then
been
pasted
on
to
the
surface
that
it
has
been
made
to
fit
when
all
this
waste
of
time
and
trouble
which
in
practice
means
money
could
have
been
saved
by
printing
the
name
on
the
label
itself
yes
that
is
so
but
i
still
do
not
see
why
the
fellow
should
not
have
thrown
away
this
label
and
typed
another
look
at
the
slip
again
said
thorndyke
it
is
faintly
but
evenly
discoloured
and
to
me
has
the
appearance
of
having
been
soaked
in
water
let
us
for
the
moment
assume
that
it
has
been
that
would
look
as
if
it
had
been
removed
from
some
other
package
which
again
would
suggest
that
the
person
using
it
had
only
the
one
slip
which
he
had
soaked
off
the
original
package
dried
cut
down
and
pasted
on
the
present
label
if
he
pasted
it
on
before
typing
the
address
which
he
would
most
probably
have
done
he
might
well
be
unwilling
to
risk
destroying
it
by
soaking
it
a
second
time
you
think
then
there
is
a
suspicion
that
the
package
may
have
been
tampered
with
there
is
no
need
to
jump
to
conclusions
replied
thorndyke
i
merely
gave
this
case
as
an
instance
showing
that
careful
examination
of
the
outside
of
a
package
or
letter
may
lead
us
to
bestow
a
little
extra
attention
on
the
contents
now
let
us
open
it
and
see
what
those
contents
are
with
a
sharp
knife
he
divided
the
outside
cover
revealing
a
stout
cardboard
box
wrapped
in
a
number
of
advertisement
sheets
the
box
when
the
lid
was
raised
was
seen
to
contain
a
single
cigar
a
large
cheroot
packed
in
cotton
wool
a
by
jove
i
exclaimed
your
own
special
fancy
thorndyke
yes
and
another
anomaly
at
once
you
see
which
might
have
escaped
our
notice
if
we
had
not
been
on
the
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
see
said
i
you
will
think
me
an
awful
blockhead
but
i
do
perceive
anything
singular
in
a
cigar
manufacturer
sending
a
sample
cigar
you
read
the
label
i
think
replied
thorndyke
however
let
us
look
at
one
of
these
leaflets
and
see
what
they
say
ah
here
we
are
bartlett
and
sons
who
own
extensive
plantations
on
the
island
of
cuba
manufacture
their
cigars
exclusively
from
selected
leaves
grown
by
themselves
they
would
hardly
make
a
trichinopoly
cheroot
from
leaf
grown
in
the
west
indies
so
we
have
here
a
striking
anomaly
of
an
east
indian
cigar
sent
to
us
by
a
west
indian
grower
and
what
do
you
infer
from
that
principally
that
this
cigar
which
by
the
way
is
an
uncommonly
fine
specimen
and
which
i
would
not
smoke
for
ten
thousand
pounds
is
deserving
of
very
attentive
examination
he
produced
from
his
pocket
a
powerful
doublet
lens
with
the
aid
of
which
he
examined
every
part
of
the
surface
of
the
cigar
and
finally
both
ends
look
at
the
small
end
he
said
handing
me
the
cigar
and
the
lens
and
tell
me
if
you
notice
anything
i
focussed
the
lens
on
the
surface
of
leaf
and
explored
every
part
of
it
minutely
it
seems
to
me
i
said
that
the
leaf
is
opened
slightly
in
the
centre
as
if
a
fine
wire
had
been
passed
up
it
so
it
appeared
to
me
replied
thorndyke
and
as
we
are
in
agreement
so
far
we
will
carry
our
investigations
a
step
further
he
laid
the
cigar
down
on
the
table
and
with
the
keen
penknife
neatly
divided
it
lengthwise
into
two
halves
exclaimed
thorndyke
as
the
two
parts
fell
asunder
and
for
a
few
moments
we
stood
silently
regarding
the
dismembered
cheroot
for
about
half
an
inch
from
the
small
end
there
appeared
a
little
circular
patch
of
white
chalky
material
which
by
the
even
manner
in
which
it
was
diffused
among
the
leaf
had
evidently
been
deposited
from
a
solution
our
ingenious
friend
again
i
surmise
said
thorndyke
at
length
taking
up
one
of
the
halves
and
examining
the
white
patch
through
his
lens
a
thoughtful
soul
jervis
and
original
too
i
wish
his
talents
could
be
applied
in
some
other
direction
i
shall
have
to
remonstrate
with
him
if
he
becomes
troublesome
it
is
your
duty
to
society
thorndyke
i
exclaimed
passionately
to
have
this
infernal
scoundrel
arrested
instantly
such
a
man
is
a
standing
menace
to
the
community
do
you
really
know
who
sent
this
thing
i
can
form
a
pretty
shrewd
guess
which
however
is
not
quite
the
same
thing
but
you
see
he
has
not
been
quite
so
clever
this
time
for
he
has
left
one
or
two
traces
by
which
his
identity
might
be
ascertained
indeed
what
traces
has
he
left
ah
now
there
is
a
nice
little
problem
for
us
to
consider
he
settled
himself
in
his
easy
chair
and
proceeded
to
fill
his
pipe
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
about
to
discuss
a
matter
of
merely
general
interest
let
us
consider
what
information
this
ingenious
person
has
given
us
about
himself
in
the
first
place
he
evidently
has
a
strong
interest
in
my
immediate
decease
now
why
should
he
feel
so
urgent
a
desire
for
my
death
can
it
be
a
question
of
property
hardly
for
i
am
far
from
a
rich
man
and
the
provisions
of
my
will
are
known
to
me
alone
can
it
then
be
a
question
of
private
enmity
or
revenge
i
think
not
to
the
best
of
my
belief
i
have
no
private
enemies
whatever
there
remains
only
my
vocation
as
an
investigator
in
the
fields
of
legal
and
criminal
research
his
interest
in
my
death
must
therefore
be
connected
with
my
professional
activities
now
i
am
at
present
conducting
an
exhumation
which
may
lead
to
a
charge
of
murder
but
if
i
were
to
die
the
inquiry
would
be
carried
out
with
equal
efficiency
by
professor
spicer
or
some
other
toxicologist
my
death
would
not
affect
the
prospects
of
the
accused
and
so
in
one
or
two
other
cases
that
i
have
in
hand
they
could
be
equally
well
conducted
by
someone
else
the
inference
is
that
our
friend
is
not
connected
with
any
of
these
cases
but
that
he
believes
me
to
possess
some
exclusive
information
concerning
him
believes
me
to
be
the
one
person
in
the
world
who
suspects
and
can
convict
him
let
us
assume
the
existence
of
such
a
person
a
person
of
whose
guilt
i
alone
have
evidence
now
this
person
being
unaware
that
i
have
communicated
my
knowledge
to
a
third
party
would
reasonably
suppose
that
by
making
away
with
me
he
had
put
himself
in
a
position
of
security
here
then
is
our
first
point
the
sender
of
this
offering
is
probably
a
person
concerning
whom
i
hold
certain
exclusive
information
but
see
now
the
interesting
corollary
that
follows
from
this
i
alone
suspect
this
person
therefore
i
have
not
published
my
suspicions
or
others
would
suspect
him
too
why
then
does
he
suspect
me
of
suspecting
him
since
i
have
not
spoken
evidently
he
too
must
be
in
possession
of
exclusive
information
in
other
words
my
suspicions
are
correct
for
if
they
were
not
he
could
not
be
aware
of
their
existence
the
next
point
is
the
selection
of
this
rather
unusual
type
of
cigar
why
should
he
have
sent
a
trichinopoly
instead
of
an
ordinary
havana
such
as
bartletts
actually
manufacture
it
looks
as
if
he
were
aware
of
my
peculiar
predilection
and
by
thus
consulting
my
personal
tastes
had
guarded
against
the
chance
of
my
giving
the
cigar
to
some
other
person
we
may
therefore
infer
that
our
friend
probably
has
some
knowledge
of
my
habits
the
third
point
is
what
is
the
social
standing
of
this
gentle
stranger
whom
we
will
call
x
now
bartletts
do
not
send
their
advertisements
and
samples
to
thomas
richard
and
henry
they
send
chiefly
to
members
of
the
professions
and
men
of
means
and
position
it
is
true
that
the
original
package
might
have
been
annexed
by
a
clerk
office
boy
or
domestic
servant
but
the
probabilities
are
that
x
received
the
package
himself
and
this
is
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
obtain
access
to
a
powerful
alkaloidal
poison
such
as
this
undoubtedly
is
in
that
case
he
would
probably
be
a
medical
man
or
a
chemist
i
suggested
not
necessarily
replied
thorndyke
the
laws
relating
to
poisons
are
so
badly
framed
and
administered
that
any
person
who
has
the
necessary
knowledge
can
obtain
almost
any
poison
that
he
wants
but
social
position
is
an
important
factor
whence
we
may
conclude
that
x
belongs
at
least
to
the
middle
class
the
fourth
point
relates
to
the
personal
qualities
of
x
now
it
is
evident
from
this
instance
alone
that
he
is
a
man
of
exceptional
intelligence
of
considerable
general
information
and
both
ingenious
and
resourceful
this
cigar
device
is
not
only
clever
and
original
but
it
has
been
adapted
to
the
special
circumstances
with
remarkable
forethought
thus
the
cheroot
was
selected
apparently
for
two
excellent
reasons
first
that
it
was
the
most
likely
form
to
be
smoked
by
the
person
intended
and
second
that
it
did
not
require
to
have
the
end
cut
off
which
might
have
led
to
a
discovery
of
the
poison
the
plan
also
shows
a
certain
knowledge
of
chemistry
the
poison
was
not
intended
merely
to
be
dissolved
in
the
moisture
of
the
mouth
the
idea
evidently
was
that
the
steam
generated
by
the
combustion
of
the
leaf
at
the
distal
end
would
condense
in
the
cooler
part
of
the
cigar
and
dissolve
the
poison
and
the
solution
would
then
be
drawn
into
the
mouth
then
the
nature
of
the
poison
and
certain
similarities
of
procedure
seem
to
identify
x
with
the
cyclist
who
used
that
ingenious
bullet
the
poison
in
this
case
is
a
white
solid
the
poison
contained
in
the
bullet
was
a
solution
of
a
white
solid
which
analysis
showed
to
be
the
most
poisonous
of
all
akaloids
the
bullet
was
virtually
a
hypodermic
syringe
the
poison
in
this
cigar
has
been
introduced
in
the
form
of
an
alcoholic
or
ethereal
solution
by
a
hypodermic
syringe
we
shall
thus
be
justified
in
assuming
that
the
bullet
and
the
cigar
came
from
the
same
person
and
if
this
be
so
we
may
say
that
x
is
a
person
of
considerable
knowledge
of
great
ingenuity
and
no
mean
skill
as
a
mechanician
as
shown
by
the
manufacture
of
the
bullet
these
are
our
principal
facts
to
which
we
may
add
the
surmise
that
he
has
recently
purchased
a
blickensderfer
of
the
literary
form
or
at
least
fitted
with
a
literary
typewheel
i
do
quite
see
how
you
arrive
at
that
i
said
in
some
surprise
it
is
merely
a
guess
you
know
he
replied
though
a
probable
one
in
the
first
place
he
is
obviously
unused
to
typing
as
the
numerous
mistakes
show
therefore
he
has
not
had
the
machine
very
long
the
type
is
that
which
is
peculiar
to
the
blickensderfer
and
in
one
of
the
mistakes
an
asterisk
has
been
printed
in
place
of
a
letter
but
the
literary
typewheel
is
the
only
one
that
has
the
asterisk
as
to
the
age
of
the
machine
there
are
evident
signs
of
wear
for
some
of
the
letters
have
lost
their
sharpness
and
this
is
most
evident
in
the
case
of
those
letters
which
are
the
most
used
the
you
will
notice
for
instance
is
much
worn
and
occurs
more
frequently
than
any
other
letter
of
the
alphabet
hence
the
machine
if
recently
purchased
was
bought
but
i
objected
it
may
not
have
been
his
own
machine
at
all
that
is
quite
possible
answered
thorndyke
though
considering
the
secrecy
that
would
be
necessary
the
probabilities
are
in
favour
of
his
having
bought
it
but
in
any
case
we
have
here
a
means
of
identifying
the
machine
should
we
ever
meet
with
it
he
picked
up
the
label
and
handed
it
to
me
together
with
his
pocket
lens
look
closely
at
the
that
we
have
been
discussing
it
occurs
five
times
in
in
in
and
in
now
in
each
case
you
will
notice
a
minute
break
in
the
loop
just
at
the
summit
that
break
corresponds
to
a
tiny
dent
in
the
type
caused
probably
by
its
striking
some
small
hard
object
i
can
make
it
out
quite
distinctly
i
said
and
it
should
be
a
most
valuable
point
for
identification
it
should
be
almost
conclusive
thorndyke
replied
especially
when
joined
to
other
facts
that
would
be
elicited
by
a
search
of
his
premises
and
now
let
us
just
recapitulate
the
facts
which
our
friend
x
has
placed
at
our
disposal
first
x
is
a
person
concerning
whom
i
possess
certain
exclusive
information
second
he
has
some
knowledge
of
my
personal
habits
third
he
is
a
man
of
some
means
and
social
position
fourth
he
is
a
man
of
considerable
knowledge
ingenuity
and
mechanical
skill
fifth
he
has
probably
purchased
quite
recently
a
fitted
with
a
literary
typewheel
sixth
that
machine
whether
his
own
or
some
other
person
property
can
be
identified
by
a
characteristic
mark
on
the
small
if
you
will
note
down
those
six
points
and
add
that
x
is
probably
an
expert
cyclist
and
a
fairly
good
shot
with
a
rifle
you
may
possibly
be
able
presently
to
complete
the
equation
x
i
am
afraid
i
said
i
do
not
possess
the
necessary
data
but
i
suspect
you
do
and
if
it
is
so
i
repeat
that
it
is
your
duty
to
society
to
say
nothing
of
your
clients
whose
interests
would
suffer
by
your
death
to
have
this
fellow
laid
by
the
heels
before
he
does
any
mischief
yes
i
shall
have
to
interfere
if
he
becomes
really
troublesome
but
i
have
reasons
for
wishing
to
leave
him
alone
at
present
you
do
really
know
who
he
is
then
well
i
think
i
can
solve
the
equation
that
i
have
just
offered
to
you
for
solution
you
see
i
have
certain
data
as
you
suggest
which
you
do
not
possess
there
is
for
instance
a
certain
ingenious
gentleman
concerning
whom
i
hold
what
i
believe
to
be
exclusive
information
and
my
knowledge
of
him
does
not
make
it
appear
unlikely
that
he
might
be
the
author
of
these
neat
little
plans
i
am
much
impressed
i
said
as
i
put
away
my
notebook
after
having
jotted
down
the
points
that
thorndyke
had
advised
me
to
consider
i
am
much
impressed
by
your
powers
of
observation
and
your
capacity
for
reasoning
from
apparently
trivial
data
but
i
do
not
see
even
now
why
you
viewed
that
cigar
with
such
immediate
and
decided
suspicion
there
was
nothing
actually
to
suggest
the
existence
of
poison
in
it
and
yet
you
seemed
to
form
the
suspicion
at
once
and
to
search
for
it
as
though
you
expected
to
find
it
yes
replied
thorndyke
to
a
certain
extent
you
are
right
the
idea
of
a
poisoned
cigar
was
not
new
to
me
and
thereby
hangs
a
tale
he
laughed
softly
and
gazed
into
the
fire
with
eyes
that
twinkled
with
quiet
amusement
you
have
heard
me
say
he
resumed
after
a
short
pause
that
when
i
first
took
these
chambers
i
had
practically
nothing
to
do
i
had
invented
a
new
variety
of
practice
and
had
to
build
it
up
by
slow
degrees
and
the
natural
consequence
was
that
for
a
long
time
it
yielded
nothing
but
almost
unlimited
leisure
now
that
leisure
was
by
no
means
wasted
for
i
employed
it
in
considering
the
class
of
cases
in
which
i
was
likely
to
be
employed
and
in
working
out
theoretical
examples
and
seeing
that
crimes
against
the
person
have
nearly
always
a
strong
medical
interest
i
gave
them
special
attention
for
instance
i
planned
a
series
of
murders
selecting
royal
personages
and
great
ministers
as
the
victims
and
on
each
murder
i
brought
to
bear
all
the
special
knowledge
skill
and
ingenuity
at
my
command
i
inquired
minutely
into
the
habits
of
my
hypothetical
victims
ascertained
who
were
their
associates
friends
enemies
and
servants
considered
their
diet
their
residences
their
modes
of
conveyance
the
source
of
their
clothing
and
in
fact
everything
which
it
was
necessary
to
know
in
order
to
achieve
their
deaths
with
certainty
and
with
absolute
safety
to
the
murderer
how
deeply
gratified
and
flattered
those
great
personages
would
have
felt
i
remarked
if
they
had
known
how
much
attention
they
were
receiving
yes
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
somewhat
startling
to
the
prime
minister
for
instance
to
have
learned
that
he
was
being
watched
and
studied
by
an
attentive
observer
and
that
the
arrangements
for
his
decease
had
been
completed
down
to
the
minutest
detail
but
of
course
the
application
of
the
method
to
a
particular
case
was
the
essential
thing
for
it
brought
into
view
all
the
incidental
difficulties
in
meeting
which
all
the
really
interesting
and
instructive
details
were
involved
well
the
particulars
of
these
crimes
i
wrote
out
at
length
in
my
private
shorthand
in
a
journal
which
i
kept
for
the
purpose
and
which
i
need
not
say
i
locked
up
securely
in
my
safe
when
i
was
not
using
it
after
completing
each
case
it
was
my
custom
to
change
sides
and
play
the
game
over
again
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
board
that
is
to
say
i
added
as
an
appendix
to
each
case
an
analysis
with
a
complete
scheme
for
the
detection
of
the
crime
i
have
in
my
safe
at
the
present
moment
six
volumes
of
cases
fully
indexed
and
i
can
assure
you
that
they
are
not
only
highly
instructive
reading
but
are
really
valuable
as
works
of
reference
that
i
can
readily
believe
i
replied
laughing
heartily
nevertheless
at
the
grotesqueness
of
the
whole
proceeding
though
they
might
have
proved
rather
incriminating
documents
if
they
had
passed
out
of
your
possession
they
would
never
have
been
read
rejoined
thorndyke
my
shorthand
is
i
think
quite
undecipherable
it
has
been
so
made
intentionally
with
a
view
to
secrecy
and
have
any
of
your
theoretical
cases
ever
turned
up
in
real
life
several
of
them
have
though
very
imperfectly
planned
and
carried
out
as
a
rule
the
poisoned
cigar
is
one
of
them
though
of
course
i
should
never
have
adopted
such
a
conspicuous
device
for
presenting
it
and
the
incident
of
the
other
night
is
a
modification
for
the
worse
of
another
in
fact
most
of
the
intricate
and
artistic
crimes
with
which
i
have
had
to
deal
professionally
have
had
their
more
complete
and
elaborate
prototypes
in
my
journals
i
was
silent
for
some
time
reflecting
on
the
strange
personality
of
my
gifted
friend
and
the
singular
fitness
that
he
presented
for
the
part
he
had
chosen
to
play
in
the
drama
of
social
life
but
presently
my
thoughts
returned
to
the
peril
that
overshadowed
him
and
i
came
back
once
more
to
my
original
question
and
now
thorndyke
i
said
that
you
have
penetrated
both
the
motives
and
the
disguise
of
this
villain
what
are
you
going
to
do
is
he
to
be
put
safely
under
lock
and
key
or
is
he
to
be
left
in
peace
and
security
to
plan
some
other
and
perhaps
more
successful
scheme
for
your
destruction
for
the
present
replied
thorndyke
i
am
going
to
put
these
things
in
a
place
of
safety
you
shall
come
with
me
to
the
hospital
and
see
me
place
the
ends
of
the
cigar
in
the
custody
of
chandler
who
will
make
an
analysis
and
report
on
the
nature
of
the
poison
after
that
we
shall
act
in
whatever
way
seems
best
unsatisfactory
as
this
conclusion
appeared
i
knew
it
was
useless
to
raise
further
objections
and
accordingly
when
the
cigar
with
its
accompanying
papers
and
wrappings
had
been
deposited
in
a
drawer
we
dismissed
it
if
not
from
our
thoughts
at
least
from
our
conversation
chapter
xiv
a
startling
discovery
the
morning
of
the
trial
so
long
looked
forward
to
had
at
length
arrived
and
the
train
of
events
which
it
has
been
my
business
to
chronicle
in
this
narrative
was
now
fast
drawing
to
an
end
to
me
those
events
had
been
in
many
ways
of
the
deepest
moment
not
only
had
they
transported
me
from
a
life
of
monotonous
drudgery
into
one
charged
with
novelty
and
dramatic
interest
not
only
had
they
introduced
me
to
a
renascence
of
scientific
culture
and
revived
under
new
conditions
my
intimacy
with
the
comrade
of
my
student
days
but
far
more
momentous
than
any
of
these
they
had
given
me
the
vision
all
too
fleeting
of
happiness
untold
with
the
reality
of
sorrow
and
bitter
regret
that
promised
to
be
all
too
enduring
whence
it
happened
that
on
this
morning
my
thoughts
were
tinged
with
a
certain
greyness
a
chapter
in
my
life
that
had
been
both
bitter
and
sweet
was
closing
and
already
i
saw
myself
once
more
an
ishmaelite
and
a
wanderer
among
strangers
this
rather
egotistical
frame
of
mind
however
was
soon
dispelled
when
i
encountered
polton
for
the
little
man
was
in
a
veritable
twitter
of
excitement
at
the
prospect
of
witnessing
the
clearing
up
of
the
mysteries
that
had
so
severely
tried
his
curiosity
and
even
thorndyke
beneath
his
habitual
calm
showed
a
trace
of
expectancy
and
pleasurable
anticipation
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
making
certain
little
arrangements
on
your
behalf
he
said
as
we
sat
at
breakfast
of
which
i
hope
you
will
not
disapprove
i
have
written
to
hornby
who
is
one
of
the
witnesses
to
say
that
you
will
meet
her
at
lawley
office
and
escort
her
and
miss
gibson
to
the
court
walter
hornby
may
be
with
them
and
if
he
is
you
had
better
leave
him
if
possible
to
come
on
with
lawley
you
will
not
come
to
the
office
then
no
i
shall
go
straight
to
the
court
with
anstey
besides
i
am
expecting
superintendent
miller
from
scotland
yard
who
will
probably
walk
down
with
us
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
i
said
for
i
have
been
rather
uneasy
at
the
thought
of
your
mixing
in
the
crowd
without
some
kind
of
protection
well
you
see
that
i
am
taking
precautions
against
the
assaults
of
the
x
and
to
tell
the
truth
and
also
to
commit
a
flagrant
bull
i
should
never
forgive
myself
if
i
allowed
him
to
kill
me
before
i
had
completed
reuben
hornby
defence
ah
here
is
polton
that
man
is
on
wires
this
morning
he
has
been
wandering
in
and
out
of
the
rooms
ever
since
he
came
like
a
cat
in
a
new
house
it
quite
true
sir
said
polton
smiling
and
unabashed
so
it
no
use
denying
it
i
have
come
to
ask
what
we
are
going
to
take
with
us
to
the
court
you
will
find
a
box
and
a
portfolio
on
the
table
in
my
room
replied
thorndyke
we
had
better
also
take
a
microscope
and
the
micrometers
though
we
are
not
likely
to
want
them
that
is
all
i
think
a
box
and
a
portfolio
repeated
polton
in
a
speculative
tone
yes
sir
i
will
take
them
with
me
he
opened
the
door
and
was
about
to
pass
out
when
perceiving
a
visitor
ascending
the
stairs
he
turned
back
here
miller
from
scotland
yard
sir
shall
i
show
him
in
yes
do
he
rose
from
his
chair
as
a
tall
man
entered
the
room
and
saluted
casting
at
the
same
time
an
inquiring
glance
in
my
direction
good
morning
doctor
he
said
briskly
i
got
your
letter
and
make
such
of
it
but
i
have
brought
down
a
couple
of
men
and
a
uniform
man
as
you
suggested
i
understand
you
want
a
house
watched
yes
and
a
man
too
i
will
give
you
the
particulars
presently
that
is
if
you
think
you
can
agree
to
my
conditions
that
i
act
entirely
on
my
own
account
and
make
no
communication
to
anybody
well
of
course
i
would
rather
you
gave
me
all
the
facts
and
let
me
proceed
in
the
regular
way
but
if
you
make
conditions
i
have
no
choice
but
to
accept
them
seeing
that
you
hold
the
cards
perceiving
that
the
matter
in
hand
was
of
a
confidential
nature
i
thought
it
best
to
take
my
departure
which
i
accordingly
did
as
soon
as
i
had
ascertained
that
it
wanted
yet
to
the
time
at
which
hornby
and
juliet
were
due
at
the
lawyer
office
lawley
received
me
with
stiffness
that
bordered
on
hostility
he
was
evidently
deeply
offended
at
the
subordinate
part
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
play
in
the
case
and
was
at
no
great
pains
to
conceal
the
fact
i
am
informed
said
he
in
a
frosty
tone
when
i
had
explained
my
mission
that
hornby
and
miss
gibson
are
to
meet
you
here
the
arrangement
is
none
of
my
making
none
of
the
arrangements
in
this
case
are
of
my
making
i
have
been
treated
throughout
with
a
lack
of
ceremony
and
confidence
that
is
positively
scandalous
even
now
i
the
solicitor
for
the
defence
am
completely
in
the
dark
as
to
what
defence
is
contemplated
though
i
fully
expect
to
be
involved
in
some
ridiculous
fiasco
i
only
trust
that
i
may
never
again
be
associated
with
any
of
your
hybrid
practitioners
sutor
ultra
sir
is
an
excellent
motto
let
the
medical
cobbler
stick
to
his
medical
last
it
remains
to
be
seen
what
kind
of
boot
he
can
turn
out
on
the
legal
last
i
retorted
that
is
so
he
rejoined
but
i
hear
hornby
voice
in
the
outer
office
and
as
neither
you
nor
i
have
any
time
to
waste
in
idle
talk
i
suggest
that
you
make
your
way
to
the
court
without
delay
i
wish
you
good
morning
acting
on
this
very
plain
hint
i
retired
to
the
clerks
office
where
i
found
hornby
and
juliet
the
former
undisguisedly
tearful
and
terrified
and
the
latter
calm
though
pale
and
agitated
we
had
better
start
at
once
i
said
when
we
had
exchanged
greetings
shall
we
take
a
cab
or
walk
i
think
we
will
walk
if
you
do
mind
said
juliet
hornby
wants
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
before
we
go
into
court
you
see
she
is
one
of
the
witnesses
and
she
is
terrified
lest
she
should
say
something
damaging
to
reuben
by
whom
was
the
subpoena
served
i
asked
lawley
sent
it
replied
hornby
and
i
went
to
see
him
about
it
the
very
next
day
but
he
would
tell
me
anything
he
did
seem
to
know
what
i
was
wanted
for
and
he
was
at
all
nice
not
at
all
i
expect
your
evidence
will
relate
to
the
i
said
there
is
really
nothing
else
in
connection
with
the
case
that
you
have
any
knowledge
of
that
is
just
what
walter
said
exclaimed
hornby
i
went
to
his
rooms
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
him
he
is
very
upset
about
the
whole
affair
and
i
am
afraid
he
thinks
very
badly
of
poor
reuben
prospects
i
only
trust
he
may
be
wrong
oh
dear
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
is
to
be
sure
here
the
poor
lady
halted
to
mop
her
eyes
elaborately
to
the
surprise
and
manifest
scorn
of
a
passing
errand
boy
he
was
very
thoughtful
and
sympathetic
walter
i
mean
you
know
pursued
hornby
and
most
helpful
he
asked
me
all
i
knew
about
that
horrid
little
book
and
took
down
my
answers
in
writing
then
he
wrote
out
the
questions
i
was
likely
to
be
asked
with
my
answers
so
that
i
could
read
them
over
and
get
them
well
into
my
head
was
it
good
of
him
and
i
made
him
print
them
with
his
machine
so
that
i
could
read
them
without
my
glasses
and
he
did
it
beautifully
i
have
the
paper
in
my
pocket
now
i
did
know
walter
went
in
for
printing
i
said
has
he
a
regular
printing
press
it
is
a
printing
press
exactly
replied
hornby
it
is
a
small
thing
with
a
lot
of
round
keys
that
you
press
down
dickensblerfer
i
think
it
is
called
ridiculous
name
is
it
walter
bought
it
from
one
of
his
literary
friends
about
a
week
ago
but
he
is
getting
quite
clever
with
it
already
though
he
does
make
a
few
mistakes
still
as
you
can
see
she
halted
again
and
began
to
search
for
the
opening
of
a
pocket
which
was
hidden
away
in
some
occult
recess
of
her
clothing
all
unconscious
of
the
effect
that
her
explanation
had
produced
on
me
for
instantly
as
she
spoke
there
flashed
into
my
mind
one
of
the
points
that
thorndyke
had
given
me
for
the
identification
of
the
mysterious
x
he
has
probably
purchased
quite
recently
a
blickensderfer
fitted
with
a
literary
typewheel
the
coincidence
was
striking
and
even
startling
though
a
moment
reflection
convinced
me
that
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
coincidence
for
there
must
be
hundreds
of
blicks
on
the
market
and
as
to
walter
hornby
he
certainly
could
have
no
quarrel
with
thorndyke
but
would
rather
be
interested
in
his
preservation
on
reuben
account
these
thoughts
passed
through
my
mind
so
rapidly
that
by
the
time
hornby
had
run
her
pocket
to
earth
i
had
quite
recovered
from
the
momentary
shock
ah
here
it
is
she
exclaimed
triumphantly
producing
an
obese
morocco
purse
i
put
it
in
here
for
safety
knowing
how
liable
one
is
to
get
one
pocket
picked
in
these
crowded
london
streets
she
opened
the
bulky
receptacle
and
drew
it
out
after
the
manner
of
a
concertina
exhibiting
multitudinous
partitions
all
stuffed
with
pieces
of
paper
coils
of
tape
and
sewing
silk
buttons
samples
of
dress
materials
and
miscellaneous
rubbish
mingled
indiscriminately
with
gold
silver
and
copper
coins
now
just
run
your
eye
through
that
jervis
she
said
handing
me
a
folded
paper
and
give
me
your
advice
on
my
answers
i
opened
the
paper
and
read
the
committee
of
the
society
for
the
protection
of
paralysed
idiots
in
submitting
this
oh
that
is
it
i
have
given
you
the
wrong
paper
how
silly
of
me
that
is
the
appeal
of
you
remember
juliet
dear
that
troublesome
person
i
had
really
to
be
quite
rude
you
know
jervis
i
had
to
tell
him
that
charity
begins
at
home
although
thank
heaven
none
of
us
are
paralysed
but
we
must
consider
our
own
must
we
and
then
do
you
think
this
is
the
one
dear
interposed
juliet
in
whose
pale
cheek
the
ghost
of
a
dimple
had
appeared
it
looks
cleaner
than
most
of
the
others
she
selected
a
folded
paper
from
the
purse
which
hornby
was
holding
with
both
hands
extended
to
its
utmost
as
though
she
were
about
to
produce
a
burst
of
music
and
opening
it
glanced
at
its
contents
yes
this
is
your
evidence
she
said
and
passed
the
paper
to
me
i
took
the
document
from
her
hand
and
in
spite
of
the
conclusion
at
which
i
had
arrived
examined
it
with
eager
curiosity
and
at
the
very
first
glance
i
felt
my
head
swim
and
my
heart
throb
violently
for
the
paper
was
headed
evidence
respecting
the
thumbograph
and
in
every
one
of
the
five
small
e
that
occurred
in
that
sentence
i
could
see
plainly
by
the
strong
light
a
small
break
or
interval
in
the
summit
of
the
loop
i
was
thunderstruck
one
coincidence
was
quite
possible
and
even
probable
but
the
two
together
and
the
second
one
of
so
remarkable
a
character
were
beyond
all
reasonable
limits
of
probability
the
identification
did
not
seem
to
admit
of
a
doubt
and
yet
our
legal
adviser
appears
to
be
somewhat
preoccupied
remarked
juliet
with
something
of
her
old
gaiety
of
manner
and
in
fact
though
i
held
the
paper
in
my
hand
my
gaze
was
fixed
unmeaningly
on
an
adjacent
as
she
spoke
i
pulled
myself
together
and
scanning
the
paper
hastily
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
in
the
first
paragraph
matter
requiring
comment
i
observe
hornby
i
said
that
in
answer
to
the
first
question
did
you
obtain
the
thumbograph
you
say
do
not
remember
clearly
i
think
i
must
have
bought
it
at
a
railway
bookstall
now
i
understood
that
it
was
brought
home
and
given
to
you
by
walter
himself
that
was
what
i
thought
replied
hornby
but
walter
tells
me
that
it
was
not
so
and
of
course
he
would
remember
better
than
i
should
but
my
dear
aunt
i
am
sure
he
gave
it
to
you
interposed
juliet
do
you
remember
it
was
the
night
the
colleys
came
to
dinner
and
we
were
so
hard
pressed
to
find
amusement
for
them
when
walter
came
in
and
produced
the
yes
i
remember
quite
well
now
said
hornby
how
fortunate
that
you
reminded
me
we
must
alter
that
answer
at
once
if
i
were
you
hornby
i
said
i
would
disregard
this
paper
altogether
it
will
only
confuse
you
and
get
you
into
difficulties
answer
the
questions
that
are
put
as
well
as
you
can
and
if
you
remember
say
so
yes
that
will
be
much
the
wisest
plan
said
juliet
let
jervis
take
charge
of
the
paper
and
rely
on
your
own
memory
very
well
my
dear
replied
hornby
i
will
do
what
you
think
best
and
you
can
keep
the
paper
jervis
or
throw
it
away
i
slipped
the
document
into
my
pocket
without
remark
and
we
proceeded
on
our
way
hornby
babbling
inconsequently
with
occasional
outbursts
of
emotion
and
juliet
silent
and
abstracted
i
struggled
to
concentrate
my
attention
on
the
elder
lady
conversation
but
my
thoughts
continually
reverted
to
the
paper
in
my
pocket
and
the
startling
solution
that
it
seemed
to
offer
of
the
mystery
of
the
poisoned
cigar
could
it
be
that
walter
hornby
was
in
reality
the
miscreant
x
the
thing
seemed
incredible
for
hitherto
no
shadow
of
suspicion
had
appeared
to
fall
on
him
and
yet
there
was
no
denying
that
his
description
tallied
in
a
very
remarkable
manner
with
that
of
the
hypothetical
x
he
was
a
man
of
some
means
and
social
position
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
knowledge
and
mechanical
skill
though
as
to
his
ingenuity
i
could
not
judge
he
had
recently
bought
a
blickensderfer
which
probably
had
a
literary
typewheel
since
it
was
purchased
from
a
literary
man
and
that
machine
showed
the
characteristic
mark
on
the
small
the
two
remaining
points
indeed
were
not
so
clear
obviously
i
could
form
no
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
thorndyke
held
any
exclusive
information
concerning
him
and
with
reference
to
his
knowledge
of
my
friend
habits
i
was
at
first
inclined
to
be
doubtful
until
i
suddenly
recalled
with
a
pang
of
remorse
and
the
various
details
that
i
had
communicated
to
juliet
and
that
she
might
easily
in
all
innocence
have
handed
on
to
walter
i
had
for
instance
told
her
of
thorndyke
preference
for
the
trichinopoly
cheroot
and
of
this
she
might
very
naturally
have
spoken
to
walter
who
possessed
a
supply
of
them
again
with
regard
to
the
time
of
our
arrival
at
cross
i
had
informed
her
of
this
in
a
letter
which
was
in
no
way
confidential
and
again
there
was
no
reason
why
the
information
should
not
have
been
passed
on
to
walter
who
was
to
have
been
one
of
the
party
at
the
family
dinner
the
coincidence
seemed
complete
enough
in
all
truth
yet
it
was
incredible
that
reuben
cousin
could
be
so
blackhearted
a
villain
or
could
have
any
motive
for
these
dastardly
crimes
suddenly
a
new
idea
struck
me
mrs
hornby
had
obtained
access
to
this
typewriting
machine
and
if
hornby
could
do
so
why
not
john
hornby
the
description
would
for
the
most
part
fit
the
elder
man
as
well
as
the
younger
though
i
had
no
evidence
of
his
possessing
any
special
mechanical
skill
but
my
suspicions
had
already
fastened
upon
him
and
i
remembered
that
thorndyke
had
by
no
means
rejected
my
theory
which
connected
him
with
the
crime
at
this
point
my
reflections
were
broken
in
upon
by
hornby
who
grasped
my
arm
and
uttered
a
deep
groan
we
had
reached
the
corner
of
the
old
bailey
and
before
us
were
the
frowning
walls
of
newgate
within
those
walls
i
knew
though
i
did
not
mention
the
fact
that
reuben
hornby
was
confined
with
the
other
prisoners
who
were
awaiting
their
trial
and
a
glance
at
the
massive
masonry
stained
to
a
dingy
grey
by
the
grime
of
the
city
put
an
end
to
my
speculations
and
brought
me
back
to
the
drama
that
was
so
nearly
approaching
its
climax
down
the
old
thoroughfare
crowded
with
so
many
memories
of
hideous
tragedy
by
the
side
of
the
gloomy
prison
past
the
debtors
door
with
its
forbidding
spiked
wicket
past
the
gallows
gate
with
its
festoons
of
fetters
we
walked
in
silence
until
we
reached
the
entrance
to
the
sessions
house
here
i
was
not
a
little
relieved
to
find
thorndyke
on
the
for
us
for
hornby
in
spite
of
really
heroic
efforts
to
control
her
emotion
was
in
a
state
of
impending
hysteria
while
juliet
though
outwardly
calm
and
composed
showed
by
the
waxen
pallor
of
her
cheeks
and
a
certain
wildness
of
her
eyes
that
all
her
terror
was
reviving
and
i
was
glad
that
they
were
spared
the
unpleasantness
of
contact
with
the
policemen
who
guarded
the
various
entrances
we
must
be
brave
said
thorndyke
gently
as
he
took
hand
and
show
a
cheerful
face
to
our
friend
who
has
so
much
to
bear
and
who
bears
it
so
patiently
a
few
more
hours
and
i
hope
we
shall
see
restored
not
only
his
liberty
but
his
honour
here
is
anstey
who
we
trust
will
be
able
to
make
his
innocence
apparent
anstey
who
unlike
thorndyke
had
already
donned
his
wig
and
gown
bowed
gravely
and
together
we
passed
through
the
mean
and
grimy
portals
into
a
dark
hall
policemen
in
uniform
and
unmistakable
detectives
stood
about
the
various
entries
and
little
knots
of
people
and
unclean
for
the
most
part
lurked
in
the
background
or
sat
on
benches
and
diffused
through
the
stale
musty
air
that
distinctive
but
indescribable
odour
that
clings
to
police
vans
and
prison
reception
rooms
an
odour
that
in
the
present
case
was
pleasantly
mingled
with
the
suggestive
aroma
of
disinfectants
through
the
unsavoury
throng
we
hurried
and
up
a
staircase
to
a
landing
from
which
several
passages
diverged
into
one
of
these
passages
a
sort
of
dark
entry
furnished
with
a
gate
of
iron
bars
we
passed
to
a
black
door
on
which
was
painted
the
inscription
old
court
counsel
and
clerks
anstey
held
the
door
open
for
us
and
we
passed
through
into
the
court
which
at
once
struck
me
with
a
sense
of
disappointment
it
was
smaller
than
i
had
expected
and
plain
and
mean
to
the
point
of
sordidness
the
woodwork
was
poor
thinly
disguised
by
yellow
graining
and
slimy
with
dirt
wherever
a
dirty
hand
could
reach
it
the
walls
were
distempered
a
pale
greenish
grey
the
floor
was
of
bare
and
dirty
planking
and
the
only
suggestions
of
dignity
or
display
were
those
offered
by
the
canopy
over
the
judge
seat
lined
with
scarlet
baize
and
surmounted
by
the
royal
arms
the
scarlet
cushions
of
the
bench
and
the
large
circular
clock
in
the
gallery
which
was
embellished
with
a
gilded
border
and
asserted
its
importance
by
a
loud
aggressive
tick
following
anstey
and
thorndyke
into
the
well
of
the
court
we
were
ushered
into
one
of
the
seats
reserved
for
counsel
the
third
from
the
front
where
we
sat
down
and
looked
about
us
while
our
two
friends
seated
themselves
in
the
front
bench
next
to
the
central
table
here
at
the
extreme
right
a
barrister
presumably
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
was
already
in
his
place
and
absorbed
in
the
brief
that
lay
on
the
desk
before
him
straight
before
us
were
the
seats
for
the
jury
rising
one
above
the
other
and
at
their
side
the
above
us
on
the
right
was
the
judge
seat
and
immediately
below
it
a
structure
somewhat
resembling
a
large
pew
or
a
desk
surmounted
by
a
brass
rail
in
which
a
person
in
a
grey
wig
the
clerk
of
the
court
was
mending
a
quill
pen
on
our
left
rose
the
dock
suggestively
large
and
roomy
enclosed
at
the
sides
with
high
glazed
frames
and
above
it
near
the
ceiling
was
the
spectators
gallery
what
a
hideous
place
exclaimed
juliet
who
separated
me
from
hornby
and
how
sordid
and
dirty
everything
looks
yes
i
answered
the
uncleanness
of
the
criminal
is
not
confined
to
his
moral
being
wherever
he
goes
he
leaves
a
trail
of
actual
physical
dirt
it
is
not
so
long
ago
that
the
dock
and
the
bench
alike
used
to
be
strewn
with
medicinal
herbs
and
i
believe
the
custom
still
survives
of
furnishing
the
judge
with
a
nosegay
as
a
preventive
of
and
to
think
that
reuben
should
be
brought
to
a
place
like
this
juliet
continued
bitterly
to
be
herded
with
such
people
as
we
saw
downstairs
she
sighed
and
looked
round
at
the
benches
that
rose
behind
us
where
a
reporters
were
already
seated
and
apparently
in
high
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
a
sensational
case
our
conversation
was
now
interrupted
by
the
clatter
of
feet
on
the
gallery
stairs
and
heads
began
to
appear
over
the
wooden
parapet
several
junior
counsel
filed
into
the
seats
in
front
of
us
lawley
and
his
clerk
entered
the
attorney
bench
the
ushers
took
their
stand
below
the
a
police
officer
seated
himself
at
a
desk
in
the
dock
and
inspectors
detectives
and
miscellaneous
officers
began
to
gather
in
the
entries
or
peer
into
the
court
through
the
small
glazed
openings
in
the
doors
chapter
xv
the
experts
the
hum
of
conversation
that
had
been
gradually
increasing
as
the
court
filled
suddenly
ceased
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
dais
was
flung
open
counsel
solicitors
and
spectators
alike
rose
to
their
feet
and
the
judge
entered
closely
followed
by
the
lord
mayor
the
sheriff
and
various
civic
magnates
all
picturesque
and
gorgeous
in
their
robes
and
chains
of
office
the
clerk
of
arraigns
took
his
place
behind
his
table
under
the
dais
the
counsel
suspended
their
conversation
and
fingered
their
briefs
and
as
the
judge
took
his
seat
lawyers
officials
and
spectators
took
their
seats
and
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
dock
a
few
moments
later
reuben
hornby
appeared
in
the
enclosure
in
company
with
a
warder
the
two
rising
apparently
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
stepping
forward
to
the
bar
stood
with
a
calm
and
demeanour
glancing
somewhat
curiously
around
the
court
for
an
instant
his
eye
rested
upon
the
group
of
friends
and
seated
behind
the
counsel
and
the
faintest
trace
of
a
smile
appeared
on
his
face
but
immediately
he
turned
his
eyes
away
and
never
again
throughout
the
trial
looked
in
our
direction
the
clerk
of
arraigns
now
rose
and
reading
from
the
indictment
which
lay
before
him
on
the
table
addressed
the
prisoner
reuben
hornby
you
stand
indicted
for
that
you
did
on
the
ninth
or
tenth
day
of
march
feloniously
steal
a
parcel
of
diamonds
of
the
goods
and
chattels
of
john
hornby
are
you
guilty
or
not
guilty
not
guilty
replied
reuben
the
clerk
of
arraigns
having
noted
the
prisoner
reply
then
proceeded
the
gentlemen
whose
names
are
about
to
be
called
will
form
the
jury
who
are
to
try
you
if
you
wish
to
object
to
any
of
them
you
must
do
so
as
each
comes
to
the
book
to
be
sworn
and
before
he
is
sworn
you
will
then
be
heard
in
acknowledgment
of
this
address
which
was
delivered
in
clear
ringing
tones
and
with
remarkable
distinctness
reuben
bowed
to
the
clerk
and
the
process
of
the
jury
was
commenced
while
the
counsel
opened
their
briefs
and
the
judge
conversed
facetiously
with
an
official
in
a
fur
robe
and
a
massive
neck
chain
very
strange
to
unaccustomed
eyes
and
ears
was
the
effect
of
this
function
half
solemn
and
half
grotesque
with
an
effect
intermediate
between
that
of
a
religious
rite
and
that
of
a
comic
opera
above
the
hum
of
conversation
the
clerk
voice
arose
at
regular
intervals
calling
out
the
name
of
one
of
the
jurymen
and
as
its
owner
stood
up
the
court
usher
and
sacerdotal
of
aspect
advanced
and
proffered
the
book
then
as
the
juryman
took
the
volume
in
his
hand
the
voice
of
the
usher
resounded
through
the
court
like
that
of
a
priest
intoning
some
refrain
or
antiphon
an
effect
that
was
increased
by
the
rhythmical
and
archaic
character
of
the
formula
samuel
seppings
a
rose
and
taking
the
testament
in
his
hand
stood
regarding
the
usher
while
that
official
sang
out
in
a
solemn
monotone
you
shall
well
and
truly
try
and
true
deliverance
make
between
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
and
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
whom
you
shall
have
in
charge
and
a
true
verdict
give
according
to
the
evidence
so
help
you
god
james
piper
another
juryman
rose
and
was
given
the
book
to
hold
and
again
the
monotonous
arose
you
shall
well
and
truly
try
and
true
deliverance
make
etc
i
shall
scream
aloud
if
that
horrible
chant
goes
on
much
longer
juliet
whispered
why
do
they
all
swear
at
once
and
have
done
with
it
that
would
not
meet
the
requirements
i
answered
however
there
are
only
two
more
so
you
must
have
patience
and
you
will
have
patience
with
me
too
wo
you
i
am
horribly
frightened
it
is
all
so
solemn
and
dreadful
you
must
try
to
keep
up
your
courage
until
thorndyke
has
given
his
evidence
i
said
remember
that
until
he
has
spoken
everything
is
against
reuben
so
be
prepared
i
will
try
she
answered
meekly
but
i
ca
help
being
terrified
the
last
of
the
jurymen
was
at
length
sworn
and
when
the
clerk
had
once
more
called
out
the
names
one
by
one
the
usher
counting
loudly
as
each
man
answered
to
his
name
the
latter
officer
turned
to
the
court
and
spectators
and
proclaimed
in
solemn
tones
if
anyone
can
inform
my
lords
the
king
justices
the
or
the
king
serjeant
ere
this
inquest
be
now
taken
between
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
and
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
of
any
treason
murder
felony
or
misdemeanour
committed
or
done
by
him
let
him
come
forth
and
he
shall
be
heard
for
the
prisoner
stands
at
the
bar
upon
his
deliverance
this
proclamation
was
followed
by
a
profound
silence
and
after
a
brief
interval
the
clerk
of
arraigns
turned
towards
the
jury
and
addressed
them
collectively
gentlemen
of
the
jury
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
stands
indicted
by
the
name
of
reuben
hornby
for
that
he
on
the
ninth
or
tenth
of
march
feloniously
did
steal
take
and
carry
away
a
parcel
of
diamonds
of
the
goods
of
john
hornby
to
this
indictment
he
has
pleaded
that
he
is
not
guilty
and
your
charge
is
to
inquire
whether
he
be
guilty
or
not
and
to
hearken
to
the
evidence
when
he
had
finished
his
address
the
clerk
sat
down
and
the
judge
a
elderly
man
with
bushy
grey
eyebrows
and
a
very
large
nose
looked
attentively
at
reuben
for
some
moments
over
the
tops
of
his
then
he
turned
towards
the
counsel
nearest
the
bench
and
bowed
slightly
the
barrister
bowed
in
return
and
rose
and
for
the
first
time
i
obtained
a
complete
view
of
sir
hector
trumpler
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
his
appearance
was
not
prepossessing
nor
though
he
was
a
large
man
and
somewhat
florid
as
to
his
countenance
particularly
striking
except
for
a
general
air
of
untidiness
his
gown
was
slipping
off
one
shoulder
his
wig
was
perceptibly
awry
and
his
threatened
every
moment
to
drop
from
his
nose
the
case
that
i
have
to
present
to
you
my
lord
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
he
began
in
a
clear
though
unmusical
voice
is
one
the
like
of
which
is
but
too
often
met
with
in
this
court
it
is
one
in
which
we
shall
see
unbounded
trust
met
by
treacherous
deceit
in
which
we
shall
see
countless
benefactions
rewarded
by
the
basest
ingratitude
and
in
which
we
shall
witness
the
deliberate
renunciation
of
a
life
of
honourable
effort
in
favour
of
the
tortuous
and
precarious
ways
of
the
criminal
the
facts
of
the
case
are
briefly
as
follows
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
most
unwilling
prosecutor
gentlemen
is
john
hornby
who
is
a
metallurgist
and
dealer
in
precious
metals
hornby
has
two
nephews
the
orphan
sons
of
his
two
elder
brothers
and
i
may
tell
you
that
since
the
decease
of
their
parents
he
has
acted
the
part
of
a
father
to
both
of
them
one
of
these
nephews
is
walter
hornby
and
the
other
is
reuben
hornby
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
both
of
these
nephews
were
received
by
hornby
into
his
business
with
a
view
to
their
succeeding
him
when
he
should
retire
and
both
i
need
not
say
occupied
positions
of
trust
and
responsibility
now
on
the
evening
of
the
ninth
of
march
there
was
delivered
to
hornby
a
parcel
of
rough
diamonds
of
which
one
of
his
clients
asked
him
to
take
charge
pending
their
transfer
to
the
brokers
i
need
not
burden
you
with
irrelevant
details
concerning
this
transaction
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
the
diamonds
which
were
of
the
aggregate
value
of
about
thirty
thousand
pounds
were
delivered
to
him
and
the
unopened
package
deposited
by
him
in
his
safe
together
with
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
he
had
written
in
pencil
a
memorandum
of
the
circumstances
this
was
on
the
evening
of
the
ninth
of
march
as
i
have
said
having
deposited
the
parcel
hornby
locked
the
safe
and
shortly
afterwards
left
the
premises
and
went
home
taking
the
keys
with
him
on
the
following
morning
when
he
unlocked
the
safe
he
perceived
with
astonishment
and
dismay
that
the
parcel
of
diamonds
had
vanished
the
slip
of
paper
however
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
safe
and
on
picking
it
up
hornby
perceived
that
it
bore
a
smear
of
blood
and
in
addition
the
distinct
impression
of
a
human
thumb
on
this
he
closed
and
locked
the
safe
and
sent
a
note
to
the
police
station
in
response
to
which
a
very
intelligent
officer
inspector
sanderson
came
and
made
a
preliminary
examination
i
need
not
follow
the
case
further
since
the
details
will
appear
in
the
evidence
but
i
may
tell
you
that
in
effect
it
has
been
made
clear
beyond
all
doubt
that
the
on
that
paper
was
the
of
the
prisoner
reuben
hornby
he
paused
to
adjust
his
glasses
which
were
in
the
very
act
of
falling
from
his
nose
and
hitch
up
his
gown
while
he
took
a
leisurely
survey
of
the
jury
as
though
he
were
estimating
their
impressionability
at
this
moment
i
observed
walter
hornby
enter
the
court
and
take
up
a
position
at
the
end
of
our
bench
nearest
the
door
and
immediately
after
superintendent
miller
came
in
and
seated
himself
on
one
of
the
benches
opposite
the
first
witness
whom
i
shall
call
said
sir
hector
trumpler
is
john
hornby
hornby
looking
wild
and
agitated
stepped
into
the
and
the
usher
having
handed
him
the
testament
sang
out
the
evidence
you
shall
give
to
the
court
and
jury
sworn
between
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
and
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
shall
be
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
so
help
you
god
hornby
kissed
the
book
and
casting
a
glance
of
unutterable
misery
at
his
nephew
turned
towards
the
counsel
your
name
is
john
hornby
is
it
not
asked
sir
hector
it
is
and
you
occupy
premises
in
mary
axe
yes
i
am
a
dealer
in
precious
metals
but
my
business
consists
principally
in
the
assaying
of
samples
of
ore
and
quartz
and
bars
of
silver
and
gold
do
you
remember
what
happened
on
the
ninth
of
march
last
perfectly
my
nephew
reuben
the
prisoner
delivered
to
me
a
parcel
of
diamonds
which
he
had
received
from
the
purser
of
the
to
whom
i
had
sent
him
as
my
confidential
agent
i
had
intended
to
deposit
the
diamonds
with
my
banker
but
when
the
prisoner
arrived
at
my

the
banks

already
closed
so
i
had
to
put
the
parcel
for
the
night

say
that

not
in
any
way
responsible

the
delay

defend
the
prisoner

did
not
ask
if
you
were
present
when

whereupon
the
spectators
sniggered

the
judge
smiled
indulgently

wrote
in
pencil
on
a
leaf
of
my
pocket
memorandum
block
in
by
reuben

which
i
closed
the
safe
and
locked
it

anything
unusual
about

your
custody

the
interval
no
they
were
attached
to
a
which
i
always
wear
are
there

duplicates
of
those
keys
the
keys
of
the
safe
i
mean
no
there
are
no
duplicates
have
the
keys
ever
gone
out
of
your
possession
yes
if
i
have
had
to
be
absent
from
the
office
for
a
considerable
time
it
has
been
my
custom
to
hand
the
keys
to
one
of
my
nephews
whichever
has
happened
to
be
in
charge
at
the
time
and
never
to
any
other
person
never
to
any
other
person
what
did
you
observe
when
you
opened
the
safe
i
observed
that
the
parcel
of
diamonds
had
disappeared
did
you
notice
anything
else
yes
i
found
the
leaf
from
my
memorandum
block
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
safe
i
picked
it
up
and
turned
it
over
and
then
saw
that
there
were
smears
of
blood
on
it
and
what
looked
like
the
print
of
a
thumb
in
blood
the
was
on
the
as
the
paper
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
safe
what
did
you
do
next
i
closed
and
locked
the
safe
and
sent
a
note
to
the
police
station
saying
that
a
robbery
had
been
committed
on
my
premises
you
have
known
the
prisoner
several
years
i
believe
yes
i
have
known
him
all
his
life
he
is
my
eldest
brother
son
then
you
can
tell
us
no
doubt
whether
he
is
or
i
should
say
he
was
ambidextrous
but
he
uses
his
left
hand
by
preference
a
fine
distinction
hornby
a
very
fine
distinction
now
tell
me
did
you
ascertain
beyond
all
doubt
that
the
diamonds
were
really
gone
yes
i
examined
the
safe
thoroughly
first
by
myself
and
afterwards
with
the
police
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
diamonds
had
really
gone
when
the
detective
suggested
that
you
should
have
the
of
your
two
nephews
taken
did
you
refuse
i
refused
why
did
you
refuse
because
i
did
not
choose
to
subject
my
nephews
to
the
indignity
besides
i
had
no
power
to
make
them
submit
to
the
proceeding
had
you
any
suspicions
of
either
of
them
i
had
no
suspicions
of
anyone
kindly
examine
this
piece
of
paper
hornby
said
sir
hector
passing
across
a
small
oblong
slip
and
tell
us
if
you
recognise
it
hornby
glanced
at
the
paper
for
a
moment
and
then
said
this
is
the
memorandum
slip
that
i
found
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
safe
how
do
you
identify
it
by
the
writing
on
it
which
is
in
my
own
hand
and
bears
my
initials
is
it
the
memorandum
that
you
placed
on
the
parcel
of
diamonds
yes
was
there
any
or
on
it
when
you
placed
it
in
the
safe
no
was
it
possible
that
there
could
have
been
any
such
marks
quite
impossible
i
tore
it
from
my
memorandum
block
at
the
time
i
wrote
upon
it
very
well
sir
hector
trumpler
sat
down
and
anstey
stood
up
to
the
witness
you
have
told
us
hornby
said
he
that
you
have
known
the
prisoner
all
his
life
now
what
estimate
have
you
formed
of
his
character
i
have
always
regarded
him
as
a
young
man
of
the
highest
character
honourable
truthful
and
in
every
way
trustworthy
i
have
never
in
all
my
experience
of
him
known
him
to
deviate
a
from
the
strictest
honour
and
honesty
of
conduct
you
regarded
him
as
a
man
of
irreproachable
character
is
that
so
that
is
so
and
my
opinion
of
him
is
unchanged
has
he
to
your
knowledge
any
expensive
or
extravagant
habits
no
his
habits
are
simple
and
rather
thrifty
have
you
ever
known
him
to
bet
gamble
or
speculate
never
has
he
ever
seemed
to
be
in
want
of
money
no
he
has
a
small
private
income
apart
from
his
salary
which
i
know
he
does
not
spend
since
i
have
occasionally
employed
my
broker
to
invest
his
savings
apart
from
the
which
was
found
in
the
safe
are
you
aware
of
any
circumstances
that
would
lead
you
to
suspect
the
prisoner
of
having
stolen
the
diamonds
none
whatever
anstey
sat
down
and
as
hornby
left
the
mopping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
the
next
witness
was
called
inspector
sanderson
the
dapper
police
officer
stepped
briskly
into
the
box
and
having
been
duly
sworn
faced
the
prosecuting
counsel
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
prepared
for
any
contingency
do
you
remember
said
sir
hector
after
the
usual
preliminaries
had
been
gone
through
what
occurred
on
the
morning
of
the
tenth
of
march
yes
a
note
was
handed
to
me
at
the
station
at
it
was
from
john
hornby
and
stated
that
a
robbery
had
occurred
at
his
premises
in
mary
axe
i
went
to
the
premises
and
arrived
there
at
there
i
saw
the
prosecutor
john
hornby
who
told
me
that
a
parcel
of
diamonds
had
been
stolen
from
the
safe
at
his
request
i
examined
the
safe
there
were
no
signs
of
its
having
been
forced
open
the
locks
seemed
to
be
quite
uninjured
and
in
good
order
inside
the
safe
on
the
bottom
i
found
two
drops
of
blood
and
a
slip
of
paper
with
on
it
the
paper
bore
two
and
a
print
of
a
human
thumb
in
blood
is
this
the
paper
asked
the
counsel
passing
a
small
slip
across
to
the
witness
yes
replied
the
inspector
after
a
brief
glance
at
the
document
what
did
you
do
next
i
sent
a
message
to
scotland
yard
acquainting
the
chief
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
with
the
facts
and
then
went
back
to
the
station
i
had
no
further
connection
with
the
case
sir
hector
sat
down
and
the
judge
glanced
at
anstey
you
tell
us
said
the
latter
rising
that
you
observed
two
drops
of
blood
on
the
bottom
of
the
safe
did
you
notice
the
condition
of
the
blood
whether
moist
or
dry
the
blood
looked
moist
but
i
did
not
touch
it
i
left
it
undisturbed
for
the
detective
officers
to
examine
the
next
witness
called
was
sergeant
bates
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
he
stepped
into
the
box
with
the
same
ready
air
as
the
other
officer
and
having
been
sworn
proceeded
to
give
his
evidence
with
a
fluency
that
suggested
careful
preparation
holding
an
open
notebook
in
his
hand
but
making
no
references
to
it
on
the
tenth
of
march
at
i
received
instructions
to
proceed
to
mary
axe
to
inquire
into
a
robbery
that
had
taken
place
there
inspector
sanderson
report
was
handed
to
me
and
i
read
it
in
the
cab
on
my
way
to
the
premises
on
arriving
at
the
premises
at
i
examined
the
safe
carefully
it
was
quite
uninjured
and
there
were
no
marks
of
any
kind
upon
it
i
tested
the
locks
and
found
them
perfect
there
were
no
marks
or
indications
of
any
picklock
having
been
used
on
the
bottom
of
the
inside
i
observed
two
rather
large
drops
of
a
dark
fluid
i
took
up
some
of
the
fluid
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
found
it
to
be
blood
i
also
found
in
the
bottom
of
the
safe
the
burnt
head
of
a
wax
match
and
on
searching
the
floor
of
the
office
i
found
close
by
the
safe
a
used
wax
match
from
which
the
head
had
fallen
i
also
found
a
slip
of
paper
which
appeared
to
have
been
torn
from
a
perforated
block
on
it
was
written
in
pencil
in
by
reuben
at
there
were
two
smears
of
blood
on
the
paper
and
the
impression
of
a
human
thumb
in
blood
i
took
possession
of
the
paper
in
order
that
it
might
be
examined
by
the
experts
i
inspected
the
office
doors
and
the
outer
door
of
the
premises
but
found
no
signs
of
forcible
entrance
on
any
of
them
i
questioned
the
housekeeper
but
obtained
no
information
from
him
i
then
returned
to
headquarters
made
my
report
and
handed
the
paper
with
the
marks
on
it
to
the
superintendent
is
this
the
paper
that
you
found
in
the
safe
asked
the
counsel
once
more
handing
the
leaflet
across
yes
this
is
the
paper
what
happened
next
the
following
afternoon
i
was
sent
for
by
singleton
of
the
department
he
informed
me
that
he
had
gone
through
the
files
and
had
not
been
able
to
find
any
resembling
the
one
on
the
paper
and
recommended
me
to
endeavour
to
obtain
prints
of
the
thumbs
of
any
persons
who
might
have
been
concerned
in
the
robbery
he
also
gave
me
an
enlarged
photograph
of
the
for
reference
if
necessary
i
accordingly
went
to
mary
axe
and
had
an
interview
with
hornby
when
i
requested
him
to
allow
me
to
take
prints
of
the
thumbs
of
all
the
persons
employed
on
the
premises
including
his
two
nephews
this
he
refused
saying
that
he
distrusted
and
that
there
was
no
suspicion
of
anyone
on
the
premises
i
asked
if
he
would
allow
his
nephews
to
furnish
their
privately
to
which
he
replied
not
had
you
then
any
suspicion
of
either
of
the
nephews
i
thought
they
were
both
open
to
some
suspicion
the
safe
had
certainly
been
opened
with
false
keys
and
as
they
had
both
had
the
real
keys
in
their
possession
it
was
possible
that
one
of
them
might
have
taken
impressions
in
wax
and
made
counterfeit
keys
yes
i
called
on
hornby
several
times
and
urged
him
for
the
sake
of
his
nephews
reputations
to
sanction
the
taking
of
the
but
he
refused
very
positively
and
forbade
them
to
submit
although
i
understood
that
they
were
both
willing
it
then
occurred
to
me
to
try
if
i
could
get
any
help
from
hornby
and
on
the
fifteenth
of
march
i
called
at
hornby
private
house
and
saw
her
i
explained
to
her
what
was
wanted
to
clear
her
nephews
from
the
suspicion
that
rested
on
them
and
she
then
said
that
she
could
dispose
of
those
suspicions
at
once
for
she
could
show
me
the
of
the
whole
family
she
had
them
all
in
a
a
repeated
the
judge
what
is
a
anstey
rose
with
the
little
volume
in
his
hand
a
my
lord
said
he
is
a
book
like
this
in
which
foolish
people
collect
the
of
their
more
foolish
acquaintances
he
passed
the
volume
up
to
the
judge
who
turned
over
the
leaves
curiously
and
then
nodded
to
the
witness
yes
she
said
she
had
them
all
in
a
then
she
fetched
from
a
drawer
a
small
book
which
she
showed
to
me
it
contained
the
of
all
the
family
and
some
of
her
friends
is
this
the
book
asked
the
judge
passing
the
volume
down
to
the
witness
the
sergeant
turned
over
the
leaves
until
he
came
to
one
which
he
apparently
recognised
and
said
yes
this
is
the
book
hornby
showed
me
the
of
various
members
of
the
family
and
then
found
those
of
the
two
nephews
i
compared
them
with
the
photograph
that
i
had
with
me
and
discovered
that
the
print
of
the
left
thumb
of
reuben
hornby
was
in
every
respect
identical
with
the
shown
in
the
photograph
what
did
you
do
then
i
asked
hornby
to
lend
me
the
so
that
i
might
show
it
to
the
chief
of
the
department
to
which
she
consented
i
had
not
intended
to
tell
her
of
my
discovery
but
as
i
was
leaving
hornby
arrived
home
and
when
he
heard
of
what
had
taken
place
he
asked
me
why
i
wanted
the
book
and
then
i
told
him
he
was
greatly
astonished
and
horrified
and
wished
me
to
return
the
book
at
once
he
proposed
to
let
the
whole
matter
drop
and
take
the
loss
of
the
diamonds
on
himself
but
i
pointed
out
that
this
was
impossible
as
it
would
practically
amount
to
compounding
a
felony
seeing
that
hornby
was
so
distressed
at
the
idea
of
her
book
being
used
in
evidence
against
her
nephew
i
promised
her
that
i
would
return
it
to
her
if
i
could
obtain
a
in
any
other
way
i
then
took
the
to
scotland
yard
and
showed
it
to
singleton
who
agreed
that
the
print
of
the
left
thumb
of
reuben
hornby
was
in
every
respect
identical
with
the
on
the
paper
found
in
the
safe
on
this
i
applied
for
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
reuben
hornby
which
i
executed
on
the
following
morning
i
told
the
prisoner
what
i
had
promised
hornby
and
he
then
offered
to
allow
me
to
take
a
print
of
his
left
thumb
so
that
his
aunt
book
should
not
have
to
be
used
in
evidence
how
is
it
then
asked
the
judge
that
it
has
been
put
in
evidence
it
has
been
put
in
by
the
defence
my
lord
said
sir
hector
trumpler
i
see
said
the
judge
hair
of
the
dog
that
bit
him
the
is
to
be
applied
as
a
remedy
on
the
principle
that
similibus
well
when
i
arrested
him
i
administered
the
usual
caution
and
the
prisoner
then
said
am
innocent
i
know
nothing
about
the
robbery
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
sat
down
and
anstey
rose
to
you
have
told
us
said
he
in
his
clear
musical
voice
that
you
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
safe
two
rather
large
drops
of
a
dark
fluid
which
you
considered
to
be
blood
now
what
led
you
to
believe
that
fluid
to
be
blood
i
took
some
of
the
fluid
up
on
a
piece
of
white
paper
and
it
had
the
appearance
and
colour
of
blood
was
it
examined
microscopically
or
otherwise
not
to
my
knowledge
was
it
quite
liquid
yes
i
should
say
quite
liquid

appearance
had
it
on
paper

looked
like
a
clear
red
liquid
of
the
colour
of
blood
and
was
rather
thick
and
sticky

minutes

he
went
up
to
the
laboratory

came
next
hornby
and
walter
came
in
just
after
him
the
counsel

down

anstey

to
the

the
last
to
leave
the
premises
on
the
evening
of
the
ninth
i
am
not
sure
why
are
you
not
sure
i
had
to
take
a
note
and
a
parcel
to
a
firm
in
shoreditch
when
i
started
a
clerk
named
thomas
holker
was
in
the
outer
office
and
walter
hornby
was
in
the
private
office
when
i
returned
they
had
both
gone
was
the
outer
door
locked
yes
had
holker
a
key
of
the
outer
door
no
hornby
and
his
two
nephews
had
each
a
key
and
i
have
one
no
one
else
had
a
key
how
long
were
you
absent
about
of
an
hour
who
gave
you
the
note
and
the
parcel
walter
hornby
when
did
he
give
them
to
you
he
gave
them
to
me
just
before
i
started
and
told
me
to
go
at
once
for
fear
the
place
should
be
closed
before
i
got
there
and
was
the
place
closed
yes
it
was
all
shut
up
and
everybody
had
gone
anstey
resumed
his
seat
the
witness
shuffled
out
of
the
box
with
an
air
of
evident
relief
and
the
usher
called
out
henry
james
singleton
singleton
rose
from
his
seat
at
the
table
by
the
solicitors
for
the
prosecution
and
entered
the
box
sir
hector
adjusted
his
glasses
turned
over
a
page
of
his
brief
and
cast
a
steady
and
impressive
glance
at
the
jury
i
believe
singleton
he
said
at
length
that
you
are
connected
with
the
department
at
scotland
yard
yes
i
am
one
of
the
chief
assistants
in
that
department
what
are
your
official
duties
my
principal
occupation
consists
in
the
examination
and
comparison
of
the
of
criminals
and
suspected
persons
these
are
classified
by
me
according
to
their
characters
and
arranged
in
files
for
reference
i
take
it
that
you
have
examined
a
great
number
of
i
have
examined
many
thousands
of
and
have
studied
them
closely
for
purposes
of
identification
kindly
examine
this
paper
singleton
here
the
fatal
leaflet
was
handed
to
him
by
the
usher
have
you
ever
seen
it
before
yes
it
was
handed
to
me
for
examination
at
my
office
on
the
tenth
of
march
there
is
a
mark
upon
it
the
print
of
a
finger
or
thumb
can
you
tell
us
anything
about
that
mark
it
is
the
print
of
the
left
thumb
of
reuben
hornby
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
you
are
quite
sure
of
that
i
am
quite
sure
do
you
swear
that
the
mark
upon
that
paper
was
made
by
the
thumb
of
the
prisoner
i
do
could
it
not
have
been
made
by
the
thumb
of
some
other
person
no
it
is
impossible
that
it
could
have
been
made
by
any
other
person
at
this
moment
i
felt
juliet
lay
a
trembling
hand
on
mine
and
glancing
at
her
i
saw
that
she
was
deathly
pale
i
took
her
hand
in
mine
and
pressing
it
gently
whispered
to
her
have
courage
there
is
nothing
unexpected
in
this
thank
you
she
whispered
in
reply
with
a
faint
smile
i
will
try
but
it
is
all
so
horribly
unnerving
you
consider
sir
hector
proceeded
that
the
identity
of
this
admits
of
no
doubt
it
admits
of
no
doubt
whatever
replied
singleton
can
you
explain
to
us
without
being
too
technical
how
you
have
arrived
at
such
complete
certainty
i
myself
took
a
print
of
the
prisoner
thumb
having
first
obtained
the
prisoner
consent
after
warning
him
that
the
print
would
be
used
in
evidence
against
him
and
i
compared
that
print
with
the
mark
on
this
paper
the
comparison
was
made
with
the
greatest
care
and
by
the
most
approved
method
point
by
point
and
detail
by
detail
and
the
two
prints
were
found
to
be
identical
in
every
respect
now
it
has
been
proved
by
exact
calculations
which
calculations
i
have
personally
verified
the
chance
that
the
print
of
a
single
finger
of
any
given
person
will
be
exactly
like
the
print
of
the
same
finger
of
any
other
given
person
is
as
one
to
thousand
millions
that
is
to
say
that
since
the
number
of
the
entire
human
race
is
about
sixteen
thousand
millions
the
chance
is
about
one
to
four
that
the
print
of
a
single
finger
of
any
one
person
will
be
identical
with
that
of
the
same
finger
of
any
other
member
of
the
human
race
it
has
been
said
by
a
great
authority
and
i
entirely
agree
with
the
statement
that
a
complete
or
nearly
complete
accordance
between
two
prints
of
a
single
finger
affords
evidence
requiring
no
corroboration
that
the
persons
from
whom
they
were
made
are
the
same
now
these
calculations
apply
to
the
prints
of
ordinary
and
normal
fingers
or
thumbs
but
the
thumb
from
which
these
prints
were
taken
is
not
ordinary
or
normal
there
is
upon
it
a
deep
but
clean
linear
scar
the
scar
of
an
old
incised
wound
and
this
scar
passes
across
the
pattern
of
the
ridges
intersecting
the
latter
at
certain
places
and
disturbing
their
continuity
at
others
now
this
very
characteristic
scar
is
an
additional
feature
having
a
set
of
chances
of
its
own
so
that
we
have
to
consider
not
only
the
chance
that
the
print
of
the
left
thumb
should
be
identical
with
the
print
of
some
other
left
thumb
which
is
as
one
to
thousand
millions
but
the
further
chance
that
these
two
identical
should
be
traversed
by
the
impression
of
a
scar
identical
in
size
and
appearance
and
intersecting
the
ridges
at
exactly
the
same
places
and
producing
failures
of
continuity
in
the
ridges
of
exactly
the
same
character
but
these
two
chances
multiplied
into
one
another
yield
an
ultimate
chance
of
about
one
to
four
thousand
trillions
that
the
prisoner
left
thumb
will
exactly
resemble
the
print
of
some
other
person
thumb
both
as
to
the
pattern
and
the
scar
which
crosses
the
pattern
in
other
words
such
a
coincidence
is
an
utter
impossibility
sir
hector
trumpler
took
off
his
glasses
and
looked
long
and
steadily
at
the
jury
as
though
he
should
say
come
my
friends
what
do
you
think
of
that
then
he
sat
down
with
a
jerk
and
turned
towards
anstey
and
thorndyke
with
a
look
of
triumph
do
you
propose
to
the
witness
inquired
the
judge
seeing
that
the
counsel
for
the
defence
made
no
sign
no
my
lord
replied
anstey
thereupon
sir
hector
trumpler
turned
once
more
towards
the
defending
counsel
and
his
broad
red
face
was
illumined
by
a
smile
of
deep
satisfaction
that
smile
was
reflected
on
the
face
of
singleton
as
he
stepped
from
the
box
and
as
i
glanced
at
thorndyke
i
seemed
to
detect
for
a
single
instant
on
his
calm
and
immovable
countenance
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
smile
herbert
john
nash
a
plump
man
of
keen
though
studious
aspect
stepped
into
the
box
and
sir
hector
rose
once
more
you
are
one
of
the
chief
assistants
in
the
department
i
believe
mr
nash
i
am
have
you
heard
the
evidence
of
the
last
witness
i
have
do
you
agree
with
the
statements
made
by
that
witness
entirely
i
am
prepared
to
swear
that
the
print
on
the
paper
found
in
the
safe
is
that
of
the
left
thumb
of
the
prisoner
reuben
hornby
and
you
are
certain
that
no
mistake
is
possible
i
am
certain
that
no
mistake
is
possible
again
sir
hector
glanced
significantly
at
the
jury
as
he
resumed
his
seat
and
again
anstey
made
no
sign
beyond
the
entry
of
a
few
notes
on
the
margin
of
his
brief
are
you
calling
any
more
witnesses
asked
the
judge
dipping
his
pen
in
the
ink
no
my
lord
replied
sir
hector
that
is
our
case
upon
this
anstey
rose
and
addressing
the
judge
said
i
call
witnesses
my
lord
the
judge
nodded
and
made
an
entry
in
his
notes
while
anstey
delivered
his
brief
introductory
speech
my
lord
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
shall
not
occupy
the
time
of
the
court
with
unnecessary
appeals
at
this
stage
but
shall
proceed
to
take
the
evidence
of
my
witnesses
without
delay
there
was
a
pause
of
a
minute
or
more
during
which
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
rustle
of
papers
and
the
squeaking
of
the
quill
pen
juliet
turned
a
white
scared
face
to
me
and
said
in
a
hushed
whisper
this
is
terrible
that
last
man
evidence
is
perfectly
crushing
what
can
possibly
be
said
in
reply
i
am
in
despair
oh
poor
reuben
he
is
lost
jervis
he
has
a
chance
now
do
you
believe
that
he
is
guilty
i
asked
certainly
not
she
replied
indignantly
i
am
as
certain
of
his
innocence
as
ever
then
said
i
if
he
is
innocent
there
must
be
some
means
of
proving
his
innocence
yes
i
suppose
so
she
rejoined
in
a
dejected
whisper
at
any
rate
we
shall
soon
know
now
at
this
moment
the
usher
voice
was
heard
calling
out
the
name
of
the
first
witness
for
the
defence
edmund
horford
rowe
a
man
with
a
shaven
face
and
stepped
into
the
box
and
was
sworn
in
due
form
you
are
a
doctor
of
medicine
i
believe
said
anstey
addressing
the
witness
and
lecturer
on
medical
jurisprudence
at
the
south
london
hospital
i
am
have
you
had
occasion
to
study
the
properties
of
blood
yes
the
properties
of
blood
are
of
great
importance
from
a
point
of
view
can
you
tell
us
what
happens
when
a
drop
of
blood
say
from
a
cut
finger
falls
upon
a
surface
such
as
the
bottom
of
an
iron
safe
a
drop
of
blood
from
a
living
body
falling
upon
any
surface
will
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
solidify
into
a
jelly
which
will
at
first
have
the
same
bulk
and
colour
as
the
liquid
blood
will
it
undergo
any
further
change
yes
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
jelly
will
begin
to
shrink
and
become
more
solid
so
that
the
blood
will
become
separated
into
two
parts
the
solid
and
the
liquid
the
solid
part
will
consist
of
a
firm
tough
jelly
of
a
deep
red
colour
and
the
liquid
part
will
consist
of
a
pale
yellow
clear
watery
liquid
at
the
end
say
of
two
hours
what
will
be
the
condition
of
the
drop
of
blood
it
will
consist
of
a
drop
of
clear
nearly
colourless
liquid
in
the
middle
of
which
will
be
a
small
tough
red
clot
supposing
such
a
drop
to
be
taken
up
on
a
piece
of
white
paper
what
would
be
its
appearance
the
paper
would
be
wetted
by
the
colourless
liquid
and
the
solid
clot
would
probably
adhere
to
the
paper
in
a
mass
would
the
blood
on
the
paper
appear
as
a
clear
red
liquid
certainly
not
the
liquid
would
appear
like
water
and
the
clot
would
appear
as
a
solid
mass
sticking
to
the
paper
does
blood
always
behave
in
the
way
you
have
described
always
unless
some
artificial
means
are
taken
to
prevent
it
from
clotting
by
what
means
can
blood
be
prevented
from
clotting
or
solidifying
there
are
two
principal
methods
one
is
to
stir
or
whip
the
fresh
blood
rapidly
with
a
bundle
of
fine
twigs
when
this
is
done
the
fibrin
the
part
of
the
blood
that
causes
solidification
adheres
to
the
twigs
and
the
blood
that
remains
though
it
is
unchanged
in
appearance
will
remain
liquid
for
an
indefinite
time
the
other
method
is
to
dissolve
a
certain
proportion
of
some
alkaline
salt
in
the
fresh
blood
after
which
it
no
longer
has
any
tendency
to
solidify
you
have
heard
the
evidence
of
inspector
sanderson
and
sergeant
bates
yes
inspector
sanderson
has
told
us
that
he
examined
the
safe
at
and
found
two
drops
of
blood
on
the
bottom
sergeant
bates
has
told
us
that
he
examined
the
safe
two
hours
later
and
that
he
took
up
one
of
the
drops
of
blood
on
a
piece
of
white
paper
the
blood
was
then
quite
liquid
and
on
the
paper
it
looked
like
a
clear
red
liquid
of
the
colour
of
blood
what
should
you
consider
the
condition
and
nature
of
that
blood
to
have
been
if
it
was
really
blood
at
all
i
should
say
that
it
was
either
defibrinated
blood
that
is
blood
from
which
the
fibrin
has
been
extracted
by
whipping
or
that
it
had
been
treated
with
an
alkaline
salt
you
are
of
opinion
that
the
blood
found
in
the
safe
could
not
have
been
ordinary
blood
shed
from
a
cut
or
wound
i
am
sure
it
could
not
have
been
now
rowe
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
on
another
subject
have
you
given
any
attention
to
made
by
bloody
fingers
yes
i
have
recently
made
some
experiments
on
the
subject
will
you
give
us
the
results
of
those
experiments
my
object
was
to
ascertain
whether
fingers
wet
with
fresh
blood
would
yield
distinct
and
characteristic
prints
i
made
a
great
number
of
trials
and
as
a
result
found
that
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
obtain
a
clear
print
when
the
finger
is
wetted
with
fresh
blood
the
usual
result
is
a
mere
red
blot
showing
no
ridge
pattern
at
all
owing
to
the
blood
filling
the
furrows
between
the
ridges
but
if
the
blood
is
allowed
to
dry
almost
completely
on
the
finger
a
very
clear
print
is
obtained
is
it
possible
to
recognise
a
print
that
has
been
made
by
a
nearly
dry
finger
yes
quite
easily
the
blood
is
nearly
solid
and
adheres
to
the
paper
in
a
different
way
from
the
liquid
and
it
shows
minute
details
such
as
the
mouths
of
the
sweat
glands
which
are
always
obliterated
by
the
liquid
look
carefully
at
this
paper
which
was
found
in
the
safe
and
tell
me
what
you
see
the
witness
took
the
paper
and
examined
it
attentively
first
with
the
naked
eye
and
then
with
a
i
see
said
he
two
and
a
print
apparently
of
a
thumb
of
the
two
marks
one
is
a
blot
smeared
slightly
by
a
finger
or
thumb
the
other
is
a
smear
only
both
were
evidently
produced
with
quite
liquid
blood
the
was
also
made
with
liquid
blood
you
are
quite
sure
that
the
was
made
with
liquid
blood
quite
sure
is
there
anything
unusual
about
the
yes
it
is
extraordinarily
clear
and
distinct
i
have
made
a
great
number
of
trials
and
have
endeavoured
to
obtain
the
clearest
prints
possible
with
fresh
blood
but
none
of
my
prints
are
nearly
as
distinct
as
this
one
here
the
witness
produced
a
number
of
sheets
of
paper
each
of
which
was
covered
with
the
prints
of
bloody
fingers
and
compared
them
with
the
memorandum
slip
the
papers
were
handed
to
the
judge
for
his
inspection
and
anstey
sat
down
when
sir
hector
trumpler
rose
with
a
somewhat
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
to
you
say
that
the
blood
found
in
the
safe
was
defibrinated
or
artificially
treated
what
inference
do
you
draw
from
that
fact
i
infer
that
it
was
not
dropped
from
a
bleeding
wound
can
you
form
any
idea
how
such
blood
should
have
got
into
the
safe
none
whatever
you
say
that
the
is
a
remarkably
distinct
one
what
conclusion
do
you
draw
from
that
i
do
not
draw
any
conclusion
i
can
not
account
for
its
distinctness
at
all
the
learned
counsel
sat
down
with
rather
a
baffled
air
and
i
observed
a
faint
smile
spread
over
the
countenance
of
my
colleague
arabella
hornby
a
muffled
whimpering
from
my
neighbour
on
the
left
hand
was
accompanied
by
a
wild
rustling
of
silk
glancing
at
hornby
i
saw
her
stagger
from
the
bench
shaking
like
a
jelly
mopping
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
and
grasping
her
open
purse
she
entered
the
and
having
gazed
wildly
round
the
court
began
to
search
the
multitudinous
compartments
of
her
purse
the
evidence
you
shall
give
sang
out
the
usher
whereat
hornby
paused
in
her
search
and
stared
at
him
apprehensively
to
the
court
and
jury
sworn
between
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
and
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
shall
be
the
truth
certainly
said
hornby
stiffly
i
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
so
help
you
god
he
held
out
the
testament
which
she
took
from
him
with
a
trembling
hand
and
forthwith
dropped
with
a
resounding
bang
on
to
the
floor
of
the
diving
after
it
with
such
precipitancy
that
her
bonnet
jammed
violently
against
the
rail
of
the
box
she
disappeared
from
view
for
a
moment
and
then
rose
from
the
depths
with
a
purple
face
and
her
bonnet
flattened
and
cocked
over
one
ear
like
an
forage
cap
kiss
the
book
if
you
please
said
the
usher
suppressing
a
grin
by
an
heroic
effort
as
hornby
encumbered
by
her
purse
her
handkerchief
and
the
testament
struggled
to
unfasten
her
she
clawed
frantically
at
her
bonnet
and
having
dusted
the
testament
with
her
handkerchief
kissed
it
tenderly
and
laid
it
on
the
rail
of
the
box
whence
it
fell
instantly
on
to
the
floor
of
the
court
i
am
really
very
sorry
exclaimed
hornby
leaning
over
the
rail
to
address
the
usher
as
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
book
and
discharging
on
to
his
back
a
stream
of
coins
buttons
and
folded
bills
from
her
open
purse
you
will
think
me
very
awkward
i
afraid
she
mopped
her
face
and
replaced
her
bonnet
rakishly
on
one
side
as
anstey
rose
and
passed
a
small
red
book
across
to
her
kindly
look
at
that
book
mrs
hornby
i
rather
not
said
she
with
a
gesture
of
repugnance
it
is
associated
with
matters
of
so
extremely
disagreeable
a
character
do
you
recognise
it
do
i
recognise
it
how
can
you
ask
me
such
a
question
when
you
must
know
answer
the
question
interposed
the
judge
do
you
or
do
you
not
recognise
the
book
in
your
hand
of
course
i
recognise
it
how
could
i
fail
to
then
say
so
said
the
judge
i
have
said
so
retorted
hornby
indignantly
the
judge
nodded
to
anstey
who
then
continued
it
is
called
a
i
believe
yes
the
name
is
printed
on
the
cover
so
i
suppose
that
is
what
it
is
called
will
you
tell
us
hornby
how
the
came
into
your
possession
for
one
moment
hornby
stared
wildly
at
her
interrogator
then
she
snatched
a
paper
from
her
purse
unfolded
it
gazed
at
it
with
an
expression
of
dismay
and
crumpled
it
up
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
you
are
asked
a
question
said
the
judge
oh
yes
said
hornby
the
committee
of
the
society
no
that
is
the
wrong
one
i
mean
walter
you
know
at
least
i
beg
your
pardon
said
anstey
with
polite
gravity
you
were
speaking
of
the
committee
of
some
society
interposed
the
judge
what
society
were
you
referring
to
hornby
spread
out
the
paper
and
after
a
glance
at
it
replied
the
society
of
paralysed
idiots
your
worship
whereat
a
rumble
of
suppressed
laughter
arose
from
the
gallery
but
what
has
that
society
to
do
with
the
inquired
the
judge
nothing
your
worship
nothing
at
all
then
why
did
you
refer
to
it
i
am
sure
i
do
know
said
hornby
wiping
her
eyes
with
the
paper
and
then
hastily
exchanging
it
for
her
handkerchief
the
judge
took
off
his
glasses
and
gazed
at
hornby
with
an
expression
of
bewilderment
then
he
turned
to
the
counsel
and
said
in
a
weary
voice
proceed
if
you
please
mr
anstey
can
you
tell
us
hornby
how
the
came
into
your
possession
said
the
latter
in
persuasive
accents
i
thought
it
was
walter
and
so
did
my
niece
but
walter
says
it
was
not
and
he
ought
to
know
being
young
and
having
a
most
excellent
memory
as
i
had
myself
when
i
was
his
age
and
really
you
know
it
ca
possibly
matter
where
i
got
the
thing
but
it
does
matter
interrupted
anstey
we
wish
particularly
to
know
if
you
mean
that
you
wish
to
get
one
like
it
we
do
not
said
anstey
we
wish
to
know
how
that
particular
came
into
your
possession
did
you
for
instance
buy
it
yourself
or
was
it
given
to
you
by
someone
walter
says
i
bought
it
myself
but
i
thought
he
gave
it
to
me
but
he
says
he
did
not
and
you
see
never
mind
what
walter
says
what
is
your
own
impression
why
i
still
think
that
he
gave
it
to
me
though
of
course
seeing
that
my
memory
is
not
what
it
was
you
think
that
walter
gave
it
to
you
yes
in
fact
i
feel
sure
he
did
and
so
does
my
niece
walter
is
your
nephew
walter
hornby
yes
of
course
i
thought
you
knew
can
you
recall
the
occasion
on
which
the
was
given
to
you
oh
yes
quite
distinctly
we
had
some
people
to
dinner
some
people
named
colley
not
the
dorsetshire
colleys
you
know
although
they
are
exceedingly
nice
people
as
i
have
no
doubt
the
other
colleys
are
too
when
you
know
them
but
we
do
well
after
dinner
we
were
a
little
dull
and
rather
at
a
loss
because
juliet
my
niece
you
know
had
cut
her
finger
and
could
play
the
piano
excepting
with
the
left
hand
and
that
is
so
monotonous
as
well
as
fatiguing
and
the
colleys
are
not
musical
excepting
adolphus
who
plays
the
trombone
but
he
had
got
it
with
him
and
then
fortunately
walter
came
in
and
brought
the
and
took
all
our
and
his
own
as
well
and
we
were
very
much
amused
and
matilda
colley
that
is
the
eldest
daughter
but
one
said
that
reuben
jogged
her
elbow
but
that
was
only
an
excuse
exactly
interrupted
anstey
and
you
recollect
quite
clearly
that
your
nephew
walter
gave
you
the
on
that
occasion
oh
distinctly
though
you
know
he
is
really
my
husband
nephew
yes
and
you
are
sure
that
he
took
the
quite
sure
and
you
are
sure
that
you
never
saw
the
before
that
never
how
could
i
he
had
brought
it
have
you
ever
lent
the
to
anyone
no
never
no
one
has
ever
wanted
to
borrow
it
because
you
see
has
it
never
at
any
time
gone
out
of
your
possession
oh
i
would
say
that
in
fact
i
have
often
thought
though
i
hate
suspecting
people
and
i
really
do
suspect
anybody
in
particular
you
know
but
it
certainly
was
very
peculiar
and
i
ca
explain
it
in
any
other
way
you
see
i
kept
the
in
a
drawer
in
my
writing
table
and
in
the
same
drawer
i
used
to
keep
my
in
fact
i
do
still
and
it
is
there
at
this
very
moment
for
in
my
hurry
and
agitation
i
forgot
about
it
until
we
were
in
the
cab
and
then
it
was
too
late
because
lawley
yes
you
kept
it
in
a
drawer
with
your
that
was
what
i
said
well
when
hornby
was
staying
at
brighton
he
wrote
to
ask
me
to
go
down
for
a
week
and
bring
juliet
miss
gibson
you
know
with
me
so
we
went
and
just
as
we
were
starting
i
sent
juliet
to
fetch
my
from
the
drawer
and
i
said
to
her
we
might
take
the
with
us
it
might
come
in
useful
on
a
wet
day
so
she
went
and
presently
she
came
back
and
said
that
the
was
not
in
the
drawer
well
i
was
so
surprised
that
i
went
back
with
her
and
looked
myself
and
sure
enough
the
drawer
was
empty
well
i
did
think
much
of
it
at
the
time
but
when
we
came
home
again
as
soon
as
we
got
out
of
the
cab
i
gave
juliet
my
to
put
away
and
presently
she
came
running
to
me
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
auntie
she
said
the
thumbograph
is
in
the
drawer
somebody
must
have
been
meddling
with
your
writing
table
i
went
with
her
to
the
drawer
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
somebody
must
have
taken
it
out
and
put
it
back
while
we
were
away
who
could
have
had
access
to
your
writing
table
oh
anybody
because
you
see
the
drawers
were
never
locked
we
thought
it
must
have
been
one
of
the
servants
had
anyone
been
to
the
house
during
your
absence
no
nobody
except
of
course
my
two
nephews
and
neither
of
them
had
touched
it
because
we
asked
them
and
they
both
said
they
had
not
thank
you
anstey
sat
down
and
hornby
having
given
another
correcting
twist
to
her
bonnet
was
about
to
step
down
from
the
box
when
sir
hector
rose
and
bestowed
upon
her
an
intimidating
stare
you
made
some
reference
said
he
to
a
society
the
society
of
paralysed
idiots
i
think
whatever
that
may
be
now
what
caused
you
to
make
that
reference
it
was
a
mistake
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
i
know
it
was
a
mistake
you
referred
to
a
paper
that
was
in
your
hand
i
did
not
refer
to
it
i
merely
looked
at
it
it
is
a
letter
from
the
society
of
paralysed
idiots
it
is
nothing
to
do
with
me
really
you
know
i
do
belong
to
the
society
or
anything
of
that
sort
did
you
mistake
that
paper
for
some
other
paper
yes
i
took
it
for
a
paper
with
some
notes
on
it
to
assist
my
memory
what
kind
of
notes
oh
just
the
questions
i
was
likely
to
be
asked
were
the
answers
that
you
were
to
give
to
those
questions
also
written
on
the
paper
of
course
they
were
the
questions
would
not
have
been
any
use
without
the
answers
have
you
been
asked
the
questions
that
were
written
on
the
paper
yes
at
least
some
of
them
have
you
given
the
answers
that
were
written
down
i
do
think
i
have
in
fact
i
am
sure
i
have
because
you
see
ah
you
do
think
you
have
sir
hector
trumpler
smiled
significantly
at
the
jury
and
continued
now
who
wrote
down
those
questions
and
answers
my
nephew
walter
hornby
he
thought
you
know
never
mind
what
he
thought
who
advised
or
instructed
him
to
write
them
down
nobody
it
was
entirely
his
own
idea
and
very
thoughtful
of
him
too
though
jervis
took
the
paper
away
from
me
and
said
i
must
rely
on
my
memory
sir
hector
was
evidently
rather
taken
aback
by
this
answer
and
sat
down
suddenly
with
a
distinctly
chapfallen
air
where
is
this
paper
on
which
the
questions
and
answers
are
written
asked
the
judge
in
anticipation
of
this
inquiry
i
had
already
handed
it
to
thorndyke
and
had
noted
by
the
significant
glance
that
he
bestowed
on
me
that
he
had
not
failed
to
observe
the
peculiarity
in
the
type
indeed
the
matter
was
presently
put
beyond
all
doubt
for
he
hastily
passed
to
me
a
scrap
of
paper
on
which
i
found
when
i
opened
it
out
that
he
had
written
x
as
anstey
handed
the
rather
questionable
document
up
to
the
judge
i
glanced
at
walter
hornby
and
observed
him
to
flush
angrily
though
he
strove
to
appear
calm
and
unconcerned
and
the
look
that
he
directed
at
his
aunt
was
very
much
the
reverse
of
benevolent
is
this
the
paper
asked
the
judge
passing
it
down
to
the
witness
yes
your
worship
answered
hornby
in
a
tremulous
voice
whereupon
the
document
was
returned
to
the
judge
who
proceeded
to
compare
it
with
his
notes
i
shall
order
this
document
to
be
impounded
said
he
sternly
after
making
a
brief
comparison
there
has
been
a
distinct
attempt
to
tamper
with
witnesses
proceed
with
your
case
mr
anstey
there
was
a
brief
pause
during
which
hornby
tottered
across
the
court
and
resumed
her
seat
gasping
with
excitement
and
relief
then
the
usher
called
out
john
evelyn
thorndyke
thank
god
exclaimed
juliet
clasping
her
hands
oh
will
he
be
able
to
save
reuben
do
you
think
he
will
dr
jervis
there
is
someone
who
thinks
he
will
i
replied
glancing
towards
polton
who
clasping
in
his
arms
the
mysterious
box
and
holding
on
to
the
microscope
case
gazed
at
his
master
with
a
smile
of
ecstasy
polton
has
more
faith
than
you
have
miss
gibson
yes
the
dear
faithful
little
man
she
rejoined
well
we
shall
know
the
worst
very
soon
now
at
any
rate
the
worst
or
the
best
i
said
we
are
now
going
to
hear
what
the
defence
really
is
god
grant
that
it
may
be
a
good
defence
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
and
i
though
not
ordinarily
a
religious
man
murmured
amen
chapter
xvi
thorndyke
plays
his
card
as
thorndyke
took
his
place
in
the
box
i
looked
at
him
with
a
sense
of
unreasonable
surprise
feeling
that
i
had
never
before
fully
realised
what
manner
of
man
my
friend
was
as
to
his
externals
i
had
often
noted
the
quiet
strength
of
his
face
its
infinite
intelligence
its
attractiveness
and
magnetism
but
i
had
never
before
appreciated
what
now
impressed
me
most
that
thorndyke
was
actually
the
handsomest
man
i
had
ever
seen
he
was
dressed
simply
his
appearance
unaided
by
the
flowing
gown
or
wig
and
yet
his
presence
dominated
the
court
even
the
judge
despite
his
scarlet
robe
and
trappings
of
office
looked
commonplace
by
comparison
while
the
jurymen
who
turned
to
look
at
him
seemed
like
beings
of
an
inferior
order
it
was
not
alone
the
distinction
of
the
tall
figure
erect
and
dignified
nor
the
power
and
massive
composure
of
his
face
but
the
actual
symmetry
and
comeliness
of
the
face
itself
that
now
arrested
my
attention
a
comeliness
that
made
it
akin
rather
to
some
classic
mask
wrought
in
the
marble
of
pentelicus
than
to
the
eager
faces
that
move
around
us
in
the
hurry
and
bustle
of
a
life
at
once
strenuous
and
trivial
you
are
attached
to
the
medical
school
at
margaret
hospital
i
believe
dr
thorndyke
said
anstey
yes
i
am
the
lecturer
on
medical
jurisprudence
and
toxicology
have
you
had
much
experience
of
inquiries
a
great
deal
i
am
engaged
exclusively
in
work
you
heard
the
evidence
relating
to
the
two
drops
of
blood
found
in
the
safe
i
did
what
is
your
opinion
as
to
the
condition
of
that
blood
i
should
say
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
had
been
artificially
treated
probably
by
defibrination
can
you
suggest
any
explanation
of
the
condition
of
that
blood
i
can
is
your
explanation
connected
with
any
peculiarities
in
the
on
the
paper
that
was
found
in
the
safe
it
is
have
you
given
any
attention
to
the
subject
of
yes
a
great
deal
of
attention
be
good
enough
to
examine
that
paper
here
the
usher
handed
to
thorndyke
the
memorandum
slip
have
you
seen
it
before
yes
i
saw
it
at
scotland
yard
did
you
examine
it
thoroughly
very
thoroughly
the
police
officials
gave
me
every
facility
and
with
their
permission
i
took
several
photographs
of
it
there
is
a
mark
on
that
paper
resembling
the
print
of
a
human
thumb
there
is
you
have
heard
two
expert
witnesses
swear
that
that
mark
was
made
by
the
left
thumb
of
the
prisoner
reuben
hornby
i
have
do
you
agree
to
that
statement
i
do
not
in
your
opinion
was
the
mark
upon
that
paper
made
by
the
thumb
of
the
prisoner
no
i
am
convinced
that
it
was
not
made
by
the
thumb
of
reuben
hornby
do
you
think
that
it
was
made
by
the
thumb
of
some
other
person
no
i
am
of
opinion
that
it
was
not
made
by
a
human
thumb
at
all
at
this
statement
the
judge
paused
for
a
moment
pen
in
hand
and
stared
at
thorndyke
with
his
mouth
slightly
open
while
the
two
experts
looked
at
one
another
with
raised
eyebrows
by
what
means
do
you
consider
that
the
mark
was
produced
by
means
of
a
stamp
either
of
indiarubber
or
more
probably
of
chromicized
gelatine
here
polton
who
had
been
by
degrees
rising
to
an
erect
posture
smote
his
thigh
a
resounding
thwack
and
chuckled
aloud
a
proceeding
that
caused
all
eyes
including
those
of
the
judge
to
be
turned
on
him
if
that
noise
is
repeated
said
the
judge
with
a
stony
stare
at
the
horrified
offender
who
had
shrunk
into
the
very
smallest
space
that
i
have
ever
seen
a
human
being
occupy
i
shall
cause
the
person
who
made
it
to
be
removed
from
the
court
i
understand
then
pursued
anstey
that
you
consider
the
which
has
been
sworn
to
as
the
prisoner
to
be
a
forgery
yes
it
is
a
forgery
but
is
it
possible
to
forge
a
or
a
it
is
not
only
possible
but
quite
easy
to
do
as
easy
as
to
forge
a
signature
for
instance
much
more
so
and
infinitely
more
secure
a
signature
being
written
with
a
pen
requires
that
the
forgery
should
also
be
written
with
a
pen
a
process
demanding
very
special
skill
and
after
all
never
resulting
in
an
absolute
but
a
is
a
stamped
impression
the
being
the
stamp
and
it
is
only
necessary
to
obtain
a
stamp
identical
in
character
with
the
in
order
to
produce
an
impression
which
is
an
absolute
in
every
respect
of
the
original
and
totally
indistinguishable
from
it
would
there
be
no
means
at
all
of
detecting
the
difference
between
a
forged
and
the
genuine
original
none
whatever
for
the
reason
that
there
would
be
no
difference
to
detect
but
you
have
stated
quite
positively
that
the
on
this
paper
is
a
forgery
now
if
the
forged
print
is
indistinguishable
from
the
original
how
are
you
able
to
be
certain
that
this
particular
print
is
a
forgery
i
was
speaking
of
what
is
possible
with
due
care
but
obviously
a
forger
might
through
inadvertence
fail
to
produce
an
absolute
and
then
detection
would
be
possible
that
is
what
has
happened
in
the
present
case
the
forged
print
is
not
an
absolute
of
the
true
print
there
is
a
slight
discrepancy
but
in
addition
to
this
the
paper
bears
intrinsic
evidence
that
the
on
it
is
a
forgery
we
will
consider
that
evidence
presently
thorndyke
to
return
to
the
possibility
of
forging
a
can
you
explain
to
us
without
being
too
technical
by
what
methods
it
would
be
possible
to
produce
such
a
stamp
as
you
have
referred
to
there
are
two
principal
methods
that
suggest
themselves
to
me
the
first
which
is
rather
crude
though
easy
to
carry
out
consists
in
taking
an
actual
cast
of
the
end
of
the
finger
a
mould
would
be
made
by
pressing
the
finger
into
some
plastic
material
such
as
fine
modelling
clay
or
hot
sealing
wax
and
then
by
pouring
a
warm
solution
of
gelatine
into
the
mould
and
allowing
it
to
cool
and
solidify
a
cast
would
be
produced
which
would
yield
very
perfect
but
this
method
would
as
a
rule
be
useless
for
the
purpose
of
the
forger
as
it
could
not
ordinarily
be
carried
out
without
the
knowledge
of
the
victim
though
in
the
case
of
dead
bodies
and
persons
asleep
or
unconscious
or
under
an
anaesthetic
it
could
be
practised
with
success
and
would
offer
the
advantage
of
requiring
practically
no
technical
skill
or
knowledge
and
no
special
appliances
the
second
method
which
is
much
more
efficient
and
is
the
one
i
have
no
doubt
that
has
been
used
in
the
present
instance
requires
more
knowledge
and
skill
in
the
first
place
it
is
necessary
to
obtain
possession
of
or
access
to
a
genuine
of
this
a
photograph
is
taken
or
rather
a
photographic
negative
which
for
this
purpose
requires
to
be
taken
on
a
reversed
plate
and
the
negative
is
put
into
a
special
printing
frame
with
a
plate
of
gelatine
which
has
been
treated
with
potassium
bichromate
and
the
frame
is
exposed
to
light
now
gelatine
treated
in
this
way
chromicized
gelatine
as
it
is
called
has
a
very
peculiar
property
ordinary
gelatine
as
is
well
known
is
easily
dissolved
in
hot
water
and
chromicized
gelatine
is
also
soluble
in
hot
water
as
long
as
it
is
not
exposed
to
light
but
on
being
exposed
to
light
it
undergoes
a
change
and
is
no
longer
capable
of
being
dissolved
in
hot
water
now
the
plate
of
chromicized
gelatine
under
the
negative
is
protected
from
the
light
by
the
opaque
parts
of
the
negative
whereas
the
light
passes
freely
through
the
transparent
parts
but
the
transparent
parts
of
the
negative
correspond
to
the
black
marks
on
the
and
these
correspond
to
the
ridges
on
the
finger
hence
it
follows
that
the
gelatine
plate
is
acted
upon
by
light
only
on
the
parts
corresponding
to
the
ridges
and
in
these
parts
the
gelatine
is
rendered
insoluble
while
all
the
rest
of
the
gelatine
is
soluble
the
gelatine
plate
which
is
cemented
to
a
thin
plate
of
metal
for
support
is
now
carefully
washed
with
hot
water
by
which
the
soluble
part
of
the
gelatine
is
dissolved
away
leaving
the
insoluble
part
corresponding
to
the
ridges
standing
up
from
the
surface
thus
there
is
produced
a
in
relief
of
the
having
actual
ridges
and
furrows
identical
in
character
with
the
ridges
and
furrows
of
the
if
an
inked
roller
is
passed
over
this
relief
or
if
the
relief
is
pressed
lightly
on
an
inked
slab
and
then
pressed
on
a
sheet
of
paper
a
will
be
produced
which
will
be
absolutely
identical
with
the
original
even
to
the
little
white
spots
which
mark
the
orifices
of
the
sweat
glands
it
will
be
impossible
to
discover
any
difference
between
the
real
and
the
counterfeit
because
in
fact
no
difference
exists
but
surely
the
process
you
have
described
is
a
very
difficult
and
intricate
one
not
at
all
it
is
very
little
more
difficult
than
ordinary
carbon
printing
which
is
practised
successfully
by
numbers
of
amateurs
moreover
such
a
relief
as
i
have
described
which
is
practically
nothing
more
than
an
ordinary
process
block
could
be
produced
by
any
the
process
that
i
have
described
is
in
all
essentials
that
which
is
used
in
the
reproduction
of
drawings
and
any
of
the
hundreds
of
workmen
who
are
employed
in
that
industry
could
make
a
of
a
with
which
an
undetectable
forgery
could
be
executed
you
have
asserted
that
the
counterfeit
could
not
be
distinguished
from
the
original
are
you
prepared
to
furnish
proof
that
this
is
the
case
yes
i
am
prepared
to
execute
a
counterfeit
of
the
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
do
you
say
that
such
a
counterfeit
would
be
indistinguishable
from
the
original
even
by
the
experts
i
do
anstey
turned
towards
the
judge
would
your
lordship
give
your
permission
for
a
demonstration
such
as
the
witness
proposes
certainly
replied
the
judge
the
evidence
is
highly
material
how
do
you
propose
that
the
comparison
should
be
made
he
added
addressing
thorndyke
i
have
brought
for
the
purpose
my
lord
answered
thorndyke
some
sheets
of
paper
each
of
which
is
ruled
into
twenty
numbered
squares
i
propose
to
make
on
ten
of
the
squares
counterfeits
of
the
and
to
fill
the
remaining
ten
with
real
i
propose
that
the
experts
should
then
examine
the
paper
and
tell
the
court
which
are
the
real
and
which
are
the
false
that
seems
a
fair
and
efficient
test
said
his
lordship
have
you
any
objection
to
offer
sir
hector
sir
hector
trumpler
hastily
consulted
with
the
two
experts
who
were
sitting
in
the
attorney
bench
and
then
replied
without
much
enthusiasm
we
have
no
objection
to
offer
my
lord
then
in
that
case
i
shall
direct
the
expert
witnesses
to
withdraw
from
the
court
while
the
prints
are
being
made
in
obedience
to
the
judge
order
singleton
and
his
colleague
rose
and
left
the
court
with
evident
reluctance
while
thorndyke
took
from
a
small
portfolio
three
sheets
of
paper
which
he
handed
up
to
the
judge
if
your
lordship
said
he
will
make
marks
in
ten
of
the
squares
on
two
of
these
sheets
one
can
be
given
to
the
jury
and
one
retained
by
your
lordship
to
check
the
third
sheet
when
the
prints
are
made
on
it
that
is
an
excellent
plan
said
the
judge
and
as
the
information
is
for
myself
and
the
jury
it
would
be
better
if
you
came
up
and
performed
the
actual
stamping
on
my
table
in
the
presence
of
the
foreman
of
the
jury
and
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
and
defence
in
accordance
with
the
judge
direction
thorndyke
stepped
up
on
the
dais
and
anstey
as
he
rose
to
follow
leaned
over
towards
me
you
and
polton
had
better
go
up
too
said
he
thorndyke
will
want
your
assistance
and
you
may
as
well
see
the
fun
i
will
explain
to
his
lordship
he
ascended
the
stairs
leading
to
the
dais
and
addressed
a
few
words
to
the
judge
who
glanced
in
our
direction
and
nodded
whereupon
we
both
gleefully
followed
our
counsel
polton
carrying
the
box
and
beaming
with
delight
the
judge
table
was
provided
with
a
shallow
drawer
which
pulled
out
at
the
side
and
which
accommodated
the
box
comfortably
leaving
the
small
free
for
the
papers
when
the
lid
of
the
box
was
raised
there
were
displayed
a
copper
a
small
roller
and
the
pawns
which
had
so
puzzled
polton
and
on
which
he
now
gazed
with
a
twinkle
of
amusement
and
triumph
are
those
all
stamps
inquired
the
judge
glancing
curiously
at
the
array
of
handles
they
are
all
stamps
my
lord
replied
thorndyke
and
each
is
taken
from
a
different
impression
of
the
prisoner
thumb
but
why
so
many
asked
the
judge
i
have
multiplied
them
answered
thorndyke
as
he
squeezed
out
a
drop
of
ink
on
to
the
slab
and
proceeded
to
roll
it
out
into
a
thin
film
to
avoid
the
uniformity
of
a
single
stamp
and
i
may
say
he
added
that
it
is
highly
important
that
the
experts
should
not
be
informed
that
more
than
one
stamp
has
been
used
yes
i
see
that
said
the
judge
you
understand
that
sir
hector
he
added
addressing
the
counsel
who
bowed
stiffly
clearly
regarding
the
entire
proceeding
with
extreme
disfavour
thorndyke
now
inked
one
of
the
stamps
and
handed
it
to
the
judge
who
examined
it
curiously
and
then
pressed
it
on
a
piece
of
waste
paper
on
which
there
immediately
appeared
a
very
distinct
impression
of
a
human
thumb
marvellous
he
exclaimed
most
ingenious
too
ingenious
he
chuckled
softly
and
added
as
he
handed
the
stamp
and
the
paper
to
the
foreman
of
the
jury
it
is
well
thorndyke
that
you
are
on
the
side
of
law
and
order
for
i
am
afraid
that
if
you
were
on
the
other
side
you
would
be
one
too
many
for
the
police
now
if
you
are
ready
we
will
proceed
will
you
please
stamp
an
impression
in
square
number
three
thorndyke
drew
a
stamp
from
its
compartment
inked
it
on
the
slab
and
pressed
it
neatly
on
the
square
indicated
leaving
there
a
sharp
clear
the
process
was
repeated
on
nine
other
squares
a
different
stamp
being
used
for
each
impression
the
judge
then
marked
the
ten
corresponding
squares
of
the
other
two
sheets
of
paper
and
having
checked
them
directed
the
foreman
to
exhibit
the
sheet
bearing
the
false
to
the
jury
together
with
the
marked
sheet
which
they
were
to
retain
to
enable
them
to
check
the
statements
of
the
expert
witnesses
when
this
was
done
the
prisoner
was
brought
from
the
dock
and
stood
beside
the
table
the
judge
looked
with
a
curious
and
not
unkindly
interest
at
the
handsome
manly
fellow
who
stood
charged
with
a
crime
so
sordid
and
out
of
character
with
his
appearance
and
i
felt
as
i
noted
the
look
that
reuben
would
at
least
be
tried
fairly
on
the
evidence
without
prejudice
or
even
with
some
prepossession
in
his
favour
with
the
remaining
part
of
the
operation
thorndyke
proceeded
carefully
and
deliberately
the
was
rolled
afresh
for
each
impression
and
after
each
the
thumb
was
cleansed
with
petrol
and
thoroughly
dried
and
when
the
process
was
completed
and
the
prisoner
led
back
to
the
dock
the
twenty
squares
on
the
paper
were
occupied
by
twenty
which
to
my
eye
at
any
rate
were
identical
in
character
the
judge
sat
for
near
upon
a
minute
poring
over
this
singular
document
with
an
expression
between
a
frown
and
a
smile
at
length
when
we
had
all
returned
to
our
places
he
directed
the
usher
to
bring
in
the
witnesses
i
was
amused
to
observe
the
change
that
had
come
over
the
experts
in
the
short
interval
the
confident
smile
the
triumphant
air
of
laying
down
a
trump
card
had
vanished
and
the
expression
of
both
was
one
of
anxiety
not
unmixed
with
apprehension
as
singleton
advanced
hesitatingly
to
the
table
i
recalled
the
words
that
he
had
uttered
in
his
room
at
scotland
yard
evidently
his
scheme
of
the
game
that
was
to
end
in
an
easy
checkmate
had
not
included
the
move
that
had
just
been
made
singleton
said
the
judge
here
is
a
paper
on
which
there
are
twenty
ten
of
them
are
genuine
prints
of
the
left
thumb
and
ten
are
forgeries
please
examine
them
and
note
down
in
writing
which
are
the
true
prints
and
which
are
the
forgeries
when
you
have
made
your
notes
the
paper
will
be
handed
to
mr
nash
is
there
any
objection
to
my
using
the
photograph
that
i
have
with
me
for
comparison
my
lord
asked
singleton
i
think
not
replied
the
judge
what
do
you
say
mr
anstey
no
objection
whatever
my
lord
answered
anstey
singleton
accordingly
drew
from
his
pocket
an
enlarged
photograph
of
the
and
a
magnifying
glass
with
the
aid
of
which
he
explored
the
bewildering
array
of
prints
on
the
paper
before
him
and
as
he
proceeded
i
remarked
with
satisfaction
that
his
expression
became
more
and
more
dubious
and
worried
from
time
to
time
he
made
an
entry
on
a
memorandum
slip
beside
him
and
as
the
entries
accumulated
his
frown
grew
deeper
and
his
aspect
more
puzzled
and
gloomy
at
length
he
sat
up
and
taking
the
memorandum
slip
in
his
hand
addressed
the
judge
i
have
finished
my
examination
my
lord
very
well
nash
will
you
kindly
examine
the
paper
and
write
down
the
results
of
your
examination
oh
i
wish
they
would
make
haste
whispered
juliet
do
you
think
they
will
be
able
to
tell
the
real
from
the
false
i
ca
say
i
replied
but
we
shall
soon
know
they
looked
all
alike
to
me
nash
made
his
examination
with
exasperating
deliberateness
and
preserved
throughout
an
air
of
stolid
attention
but
at
length
he
too
completed
his
notes
and
handed
the
paper
back
to
the
usher
now
singleton
said
the
judge
let
us
hear
your
conclusions
you
have
been
sworn
singleton
stepped
into
the
and
laying
his
notes
on
the
ledge
faced
the
judge
have
you
examined
the
paper
that
was
handed
to
you
asked
sir
hector
trumpler
i
have
what
did
you
see
on
the
paper
i
saw
twenty
of
which
some
were
evident
forgeries
some
were
evidently
genuine
and
some
were
doubtful
taking
the
what
have
you
noted
about
them
singleton
examined
his
notes
and
replied
the
on
square
one
is
evidently
a
forgery
as
is
also
number
two
though
it
is
a
passable
imitation
three
and
four
are
genuine
five
is
an
obvious
forgery
six
is
a
genuine
seven
is
a
forgery
though
a
good
one
eight
is
genuine
nine
is
i
think
a
forgery
though
it
is
a
remarkably
good
imitation
ten
and
eleven
are
genuine
twelve
and
thirteen
are
forgeries
but
as
to
fourteen
i
am
very
doubtful
though
i
am
inclined
to
regard
it
as
a
forgery
fifteen
is
genuine
and
i
think
sixteen
is
also
but
i
will
not
swear
to
it
seventeen
is
certainly
genuine
eighteen
and
nineteen
i
am
rather
doubtful
about
but
i
am
disposed
to
consider
them
both
forgeries
twenty
is
certainly
a
genuine
as
singleton
evidence
proceeded
a
look
of
surprise
began
to
make
its
appearance
on
the
judge
face
while
the
jury
glanced
from
the
witness
to
the
notes
before
them
and
from
their
notes
to
one
another
in
undisguised
astonishment
as
to
sir
hector
trumpler
that
luminary
of
british
jurisprudence
was
evidently
completely
fogged
for
as
statement
followed
statement
he
pursed
up
his
lips
and
his
broad
red
face
became
overshadowed
by
an
expression
of
utter
bewilderment
for
a
few
seconds
he
stared
blankly
at
his
witness
and
then
dropped
on
to
his
seat
with
a
thump
that
shook
the
court
you
have
no
doubt
said
anstey
as
to
the
correctness
of
your
conclusions
for
instance
you
are
quite
sure
that
the
prints
one
and
two
are
forgeries
i
have
no
doubt
you
swear
that
those
two
prints
are
forgeries
singleton
hesitated
for
a
moment
he
had
been
watching
the
judge
and
the
jury
and
had
apparently
misinterpreted
their
surprise
assuming
it
to
be
due
to
his
own
remarkable
powers
of
discrimination
and
his
confidence
had
revived
accordingly
yes
he
answered
i
swear
that
they
are
forgeries
anstey
sat
down
and
singleton
having
passed
his
notes
up
to
the
judge
retired
from
the
box
giving
place
to
his
colleague
nash
who
had
listened
with
manifest
satisfaction
to
the
evidence
stepped
into
the
box
with
all
his
original
confidence
restored
his
selection
of
the
true
and
the
false
was
practically
identical
with
that
of
singleton
and
his
knowledge
of
this
fact
led
him
to
state
his
conclusions
with
an
air
that
was
authoritative
and
even
dogmatic
i
am
quite
satisfied
of
the
correctness
of
my
statements
he
said
in
reply
to
anstey
question
and
i
am
prepared
to
swear
and
do
swear
that
those
which
i
have
stated
to
be
forgeries
are
forgeries
and
that
their
detection
presents
no
difficulty
to
an
observer
who
has
an
expert
acquaintance
with
there
is
one
question
that
i
should
like
to
ask
said
the
judge
when
the
expert
had
left
the
box
and
thorndyke
had
it
to
continue
his
evidence
the
conclusions
of
the
expert
witnesses
manifestly
conclusions
arrived
at
by
individual
judgement
without
collusion
or
comparison
of
results
are
practically
identical
they
are
virtually
in
complete
agreement
now
the
strange
thing
is
this
their
conclusions
are
wrong
in
every
instance
here
i
nearly
laughed
aloud
for
as
i
glanced
at
the
two
experts
the
expression
of
smug
satisfaction
on
their
countenances
changed
with
lightning
rapidity
to
a
ludicrous
spasm
of
consternation
not
sometimes
wrong
and
sometimes
right
as
would
have
been
the
case
if
they
had
made
mere
guesses
but
wrong
every
time
when
they
are
quite
certain
they
are
quite
wrong
and
when
they
are
doubtful
they
incline
to
the
wrong
conclusion
this
is
a
very
strange
coincidence
thorndyke
can
you
explain
it
thorndyke
face
which
throughout
the
proceedings
had
been
as
expressionless
as
that
of
a
wooden
figurehead
now
relaxed
into
a
dry
smile
i
think
i
can
my
lord
he
replied
the
object
of
a
forger
in
executing
a
forgery
is
to
produce
deception
on
those
who
shall
examine
the
forgery
ah
said
the
judge
and
face
relaxed
into
a
dry
smile
while
the
jury
broke
out
into
unconcealed
grins
it
was
evident
to
me
continued
thorndyke
that
the
experts
would
be
unable
to
distinguish
the
real
from
the
forged
and
that
being
so
that
they
would
look
for
some
collateral
evidence
to
guide
them
i
therefore
supplied
that
collateral
evidence
now
if
ten
prints
are
taken
without
special
precautions
from
a
single
finger
it
will
probably
happen
that
no
two
of
them
are
exactly
alike
for
the
finger
being
a
rounded
object
of
which
only
a
small
part
touches
the
paper
the
impressions
produced
will
show
little
variations
according
to
the
part
of
the
finger
by
which
the
print
is
made
but
a
stamp
such
as
i
have
used
has
a
flat
surface
like
that
of
a
printer
type
and
like
a
type
it
always
prints
the
same
impression
it
does
not
reproduce
the
but
a
particular
print
of
the
finger
and
so
if
ten
prints
are
made
with
a
single
stamp
each
print
will
be
a
mechanical
repetition
of
the
other
nine
thus
on
a
sheet
bearing
twenty
of
which
ten
were
forgeries
made
with
a
single
stamp
it
would
be
easy
to
pick
out
the
ten
forged
prints
by
the
fact
that
they
would
all
be
mechanical
repetitions
of
one
another
while
the
genuine
prints
could
be
distinguished
by
the
fact
of
their
presenting
trifling
variations
in
the
position
of
the
finger
anticipating
this
line
of
reasoning
i
was
careful
to
make
each
print
with
a
different
stamp
and
each
stamp
was
made
from
a
different
and
i
further
selected
which
varied
as
widely
as
possible
when
i
made
the
stamps
moreover
when
i
made
the
real
i
was
careful
to
put
the
thumb
down
in
the
same
position
each
time
as
far
as
i
was
able
and
so
it
happened
that
on
the
sheet
submitted
to
the
experts
the
real
were
nearly
all
alike
while
the
forgeries
presented
considerable
variations
the
instances
in
which
the
witnesses
were
quite
certain
were
those
in
which
i
succeeded
in
making
the
genuine
prints
repeat
one
another
and
the
doubtful
cases
were
those
in
which
i
partially
failed
thank
you
that
is
quite
clear
said
the
judge
with
a
smile
of
deep
content
such
as
is
apt
to
appear
on
the
judicial
countenance
when
an
expert
witness
is
knocked
off
his
pedestal
we
may
now
proceed
mr
anstey
you
have
told
us
resumed
anstey
and
have
submitted
proofs
that
it
is
possible
to
forge
a
so
that
detection
is
impossible
you
have
also
stated
that
the
on
the
paper
found
in
safe
is
a
forgery
do
you
mean
that
it
be
a
forgery
or
that
it
actually
is
one
i
mean
that
it
actually
is
a
forgery
when
did
you
first
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
forgery
when
i
saw
it
at
scotland
yard
there
are
three
facts
which
suggested
this
conclusion
in
the
first
place
the
print
was
obviously
produced
with
liquid
blood
and
yet
it
was
a
beautifully
clear
and
distinct
impression
but
such
an
impression
could
not
be
produced
with
liquid
blood
without
the
use
of
a
slab
and
roller
even
if
great
care
were
used
and
still
less
could
it
have
been
produced
by
an
accidental
smear
in
the
second
place
on
measuring
the
print
with
a
micrometer
i
found
that
it
did
not
agree
in
dimensions
with
a
genuine
of
reuben
hornby
it
was
appreciably
larger
i
photographed
the
print
with
the
micrometer
in
contact
and
on
comparing
this
with
a
genuine
also
photographed
with
the
same
micrometer
in
contact
i
found
that
the
suspected
print
was
larger
by
the
fortieth
of
an
inch
from
one
given
point
on
the
to
another
given
point
i
have
here
enlargements
of
the
two
photographs
in
which
the
disagreement
in
size
is
clearly
shown
by
the
lines
of
the
micrometer
i
have
also
the
micrometer
itself
and
a
portable
microscope
if
the
court
wishes
to
verify
the
photographs
thank
you
said
the
judge
with
a
bland
smile
we
will
accept
your
sworn
testimony
unless
the
learned
counsel
for
the
prosecution
demands
verification
he
received
the
photographs
which
thorndyke
handed
up
and
having
examined
them
with
close
attention
passed
them
on
to
the
jury
the
third
fact
resumed
thorndyke
is
of
much
more
importance
since
it
not
only
proves
the
print
to
be
a
forgery
but
also
furnishes
a
very
distinct
clue
to
the
origin
of
the
forgery
and
so
to
the
identity
of
the
forger
here
the
court
became
hushed
until
the
silence
was
so
profound
that
the
ticking
of
the
clock
seemed
a
sensible
interruption
i
glanced
at
walter
who
sat
motionless
and
rigid
at
the
end
of
the
bench
and
perceived
that
a
horrible
pallor
had
spread
over
his
face
while
his
forehead
was
covered
with
beads
of
perspiration
on
looking
at
the
print
closely
i
noticed
at
one
part
a
minute
white
mark
or
space
it
was
of
the
shape
of
a
capital
s
and
had
evidently
been
produced
by
a
defect
in
the
paper
a
loose
fibre
which
had
stuck
to
the
thumb
and
been
detached
by
it
from
the
paper
leaving
a
blank
space
where
it
had
been
but
on
examining
the
paper
under
a
low
power
of
the
microscope
i
found
the
surface
to
be
perfect
and
intact
no
loose
fibre
had
been
detached
from
it
for
if
it
had
the
broken
end
or
at
least
the
groove
in
which
it
had
lain
would
have
been
visible
the
inference
seemed
to
be
that
the
loose
fibre
had
existed
not
in
the
paper
which
was
found
in
the
safe
but
in
the
paper
on
which
the
original
had
been
made
now
as
far
as
i
knew
there
was
only
one
undoubted
of
reuben
hornby
in
existence
the
one
in
the
at
my
request
the
was
brought
to
my
chambers
by
hornby
and
on
examining
the
print
of
reuben
hornby
left
thumb
i
perceived
on
it
a
minute
white
space
occupying
a
similar
position
to
that
in
the
red
and
when
i
looked
at
it
through
a
powerful
lens
i
could
clearly
see
the
little
groove
in
the
paper
in
which
the
fibre
had
lain
and
from
which
it
had
been
lifted
by
the
inked
thumb
i
subsequently
made
a
systematic
comparison
of
the
marks
in
the
two
i
found
that
the
dimensions
of
the
mark
were
proportionally
the
same
in
each
that
is
to
say
the
mark
in
the
print
had
an
extreme
length
of
of
an
inch
and
an
extreme
breadth
of
of
an
inch
while
that
in
the
red
was
larger
in
each
dimension
having
an
extreme
length
of
of
an
inch
and
an
extreme
breadth
of
of
an
inch
that
the
shape
was
identical
as
was
shown
by
superimposing
tracings
of
greatly
enlarged
photographs
of
each
mark
on
similar
enlargements
of
the
other
and
that
the
mark
intersected
the
ridges
of
the
in
the
same
manner
and
at
exactly
the
same
parts
in
the
two
prints
do
you
say
that
having
regard
to
the
facts
which
you
have
stated
it
is
certain
that
the
red
is
a
forgery
i
do
and
i
also
say
that
it
is
certain
that
the
forgery
was
executed
by
means
of
the
might
not
the
resemblances
be
merely
a
coincidence
no
by
the
law
of
probabilities
which
singleton
explained
so
clearly
in
his
evidence
the
adverse
chances
would
run
into
untold
millions
here
are
two
made
in
different
places
and
at
different
times
an
interval
of
many
weeks
intervening
each
of
them
bears
an
accidental
mark
which
is
due
not
to
any
peculiarity
of
the
thumb
but
to
a
peculiarity
of
the
paper
on
the
theory
of
coincidences
it
is
necessary
to
suppose
that
each
piece
of
paper
had
a
loose
fibre
of
exactly
identical
shape
and
size
and
that
this
fibre
came
by
accident
in
contact
with
the
thumb
at
exactly
the
same
spot
but
such
a
supposition
would
be
more
opposed
to
probabilities
even
than
the
supposition
that
two
exactly
similar
should
have
been
made
by
different
persons
and
then
there
is
the
further
fact
that
the
paper
found
in
the
safe
had
no
loose
fibre
to
account
for
the
mark
what
is
your
explanation
of
the
presence
of
defibrinated
blood
in
the
safe
it
was
probably
used
by
the
forger
in
making
the
for
which
purpose
fresh
blood
would
be
less
suitable
by
reason
of
its
clotting
he
would
probably
have
carried
a
small
quantity
in
a
bottle
together
with
the
pocket
slab
and
roller
invented
by
galton
it
would
thus
be
possible
for
him
to
put
a
drop
on
the
slab
roll
it
out
into
a
thin
film
and
take
a
clean
impression
with
his
stamp
it
must
be
remembered
that
these
precautions
were
quite
necessary
since
he
had
to
make
a
recognisable
print
at
the
first
attempt
a
failure
and
a
second
trial
would
have
destroyed
the
accidental
appearance
and
might
have
aroused
suspicion
you
have
made
some
enlarged
photographs
of
the
have
you
not
yes
i
have
here
two
enlarged
photographs
one
of
the
print
and
one
of
the
red
they
both
show
the
white
mark
very
clearly
and
will
assist
comparison
of
the
originals
in
which
the
mark
is
plainly
visible
through
a
lens
he
handed
the
two
photographs
up
to
the
judge
together
with
the
the
memorandum
slip
and
a
powerful
doublet
lens
with
which
to
examine
them
the
judge
inspected
the
two
original
documents
with
the
aid
of
the
lens
and
compared
them
with
the
photographs
nodding
approvingly
as
he
made
out
the
points
of
agreement
then
he
passed
them
on
to
the
jury
and
made
an
entry
in
his
notes
while
this
was
going
on
my
attention
was
attracted
by
walter
hornby
an
expression
of
terror
and
wild
despair
had
settled
on
his
face
which
was
ghastly
in
its
pallor
and
bedewed
with
sweat
he
looked
furtively
at
thorndyke
and
as
i
noted
the
murderous
hate
in
his
eyes
i
recalled
our
midnight
adventure
in
john
street
and
the
mysterious
cigar
suddenly
he
rose
to
his
feet
wiping
his
brow
and
steadying
himself
against
the
bench
with
a
shaking
hand
then
he
walked
quietly
to
the
door
and
went
out
apparently
i
was
not
the
only
onlooker
who
had
been
interested
in
his
doings
for
as
the
door
swung
to
after
him
superintendent
miller
rose
from
his
seat
and
went
out
by
the
other
door
are
you
this
witness
the
judge
inquired
glancing
at
sir
hector
trumpler
no
my
lord
was
the
reply
are
you
calling
any
more
witnesses
mr
anstey
only
one
my
lord
replied
anstey
the
prisoner
whom
i
shall
put
in
the
as
a
matter
of
form
in
order
that
he
may
make
a
statement
on
oath
reuben
was
accordingly
conducted
from
the
dock
to
the
and
having
been
sworn
made
a
solemn
declaration
of
his
innocence
a
brief
followed
in
which
nothing
was
elicited
but
that
reuben
had
spent
the
evening
at
his
club
and
gone
home
to
his
rooms
about
eleven
and
had
let
himself
in
with
his
latchkey
sir
hector
at
length
sat
down
the
prisoner
was
led
back
to
the
dock
and
the
court
settled
itself
to
listen
to
the
speeches
of
the
counsel
my
lord
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
anstey
commenced
in
his
clear
mellow
tones
i
do
not
propose
to
occupy
your
time
with
a
long
speech
the
evidence
that
has
been
laid
before
you
is
at
once
so
intelligible
so
lucid
and
so
conclusive
that
you
will
no
doubt
arrive
at
your
verdict
uninfluenced
by
any
display
of
rhetoric
either
on
my
part
or
on
the
part
of
the
learned
counsel
for
the
prosecution
nevertheless
it
is
desirable
to
disentangle
from
the
mass
of
evidence
those
facts
which
are
really
vital
and
crucial
now
the
one
fact
which
stands
out
and
dominates
the
whole
case
is
this
the
prisoner
connection
with
this
case
rests
solely
upon
the
police
theory
of
the
infallibility
of
apart
from
the
evidence
of
the
there
is
not
and
there
never
was
the
faintest
breath
of
suspicion
against
him
you
have
heard
him
described
as
a
man
of
unsullied
honour
as
a
man
whose
character
is
above
reproach
a
man
who
is
trusted
implicitly
by
those
who
have
had
dealings
with
him
and
this
character
was
not
given
by
a
casual
stranger
but
by
one
who
has
known
him
from
childhood
his
record
is
an
unbroken
record
of
honourable
conduct
his
life
has
been
that
of
a
straightforward
gentleman
and
now
he
stands
before
you
charged
with
a
miserable
paltry
theft
charged
with
having
robbed
that
generous
friend
the
brother
of
his
own
father
the
guardian
of
his
childhood
and
the
benefactor
who
has
planned
and
striven
for
his
charged
in
short
gentlemen
with
a
crime
which
every
circumstance
connected
with
him
and
every
trait
of
his
known
character
renders
utterly
inconceivable
now
upon
what
grounds
has
this
gentleman
of
irreproachable
character
been
charged
with
this
mean
and
sordid
crime
baldly
stated
the
grounds
of
the
accusation
are
these
a
certain
learned
and
eminent
man
of
science
has
made
a
statement
which
the
police
have
not
merely
accepted
but
have
in
practice
extended
beyond
its
original
meaning
that
statement
is
as
follows
complete
or
nearly
complete
accordance
between
two
prints
of
a
single
finger
affords
evidence
requiring
no
corroboration
that
the
persons
from
whom
they
were
made
are
the
same
that
statement
gentlemen
is
in
the
highest
degree
misleading
and
ought
not
to
have
been
made
without
due
warning
and
qualification
so
far
is
it
from
being
true
in
practice
that
its
exact
contrary
is
the
fact
the
evidence
of
a
in
the
absence
of
corroboration
is
absolutely
worthless
of
all
forms
of
forgery
the
forgery
of
a
is
the
easiest
and
most
secure
as
you
have
seen
in
this
court
consider
the
character
of
the
forger
his
skill
his
ingenuity
his
resource
think
of
the
forged
banknotes
of
which
not
only
the
engraving
the
design
and
the
signature
but
even
the
very
paper
with
its
private
watermarks
is
imitated
with
a
perfection
that
is
at
once
the
admiration
and
the
despair
of
those
who
have
to
distinguish
the
true
from
the
false
think
of
the
forged
cheque
in
which
actual
perforations
are
filled
up
of
which
portions
are
cut
out
bodily
and
replaced
by
indistinguishable
patches
think
of
these
and
then
of
a
of
which
any
apprentice
can
make
you
a
forgery
that
the
greatest
experts
can
not
distinguish
from
the
original
which
any
capable
amateur
can
imitate
beyond
detection
after
a
month
practice
and
then
ask
yourselves
if
this
is
the
kind
of
evidence
on
which
without
any
support
or
corroboration
a
gentleman
of
honour
and
position
should
be
dragged
before
a
criminal
court
and
charged
with
having
committed
a
crime
of
the
basest
and
most
sordid
type
but
i
must
not
detain
you
with
unnecessary
appeals
i
will
remind
you
briefly
of
the
salient
facts
the
case
for
the
prosecution
rests
upon
the
assertion
that
the
found
in
the
safe
was
made
by
the
thumb
of
the
prisoner
if
that
was
not
made
by
the
prisoner
there
is
not
only
no
case
against
him
but
no
suspicion
of
any
kind
now
was
that
made
by
the
prisoner
thumb
you
have
had
conclusive
evidence
that
it
was
not
that
differed
in
the
size
or
scale
of
the
pattern
from
a
genuine
of
the
prisoner
the
difference
was
small
but
it
was
fatal
to
the
police
theory
the
two
prints
were
not
identical
but
if
not
the
prisoner
what
was
it
the
resemblance
of
the
pattern
was
too
exact
for
it
to
be
the
of
another
person
for
it
reproduced
not
only
the
pattern
of
the
ridges
on
the
prisoner
thumb
but
also
the
scar
of
an
old
wound
the
answer
that
i
propose
to
this
question
is
that
it
was
an
intentional
imitation
of
the
prisoner
made
with
the
purpose
of
fixing
suspicion
on
the
prisoner
and
so
ensuring
the
safety
of
the
actual
criminal
are
there
any
facts
which
support
this
theory
yes
there
are
several
facts
which
support
it
very
strongly
first
there
are
the
facts
that
i
have
just
mentioned
the
red
disagreed
with
the
genuine
print
in
its
scale
or
dimensions
it
was
not
the
prisoner
but
neither
was
it
that
of
any
other
person
the
only
alternative
is
that
it
was
a
forgery
in
the
second
place
that
print
was
evidently
made
with
the
aid
of
certain
appliances
and
materials
and
one
of
those
materials
namely
defibrinated
blood
was
found
in
the
safe
in
the
third
place
there
is
the
coincidence
that
the
print
was
one
which
it
was
possible
to
forge
the
prisoner
has
ten
digits
eight
fingers
and
two
thumbs
but
there
were
in
existence
actual
prints
of
the
two
thumbs
whereas
no
prints
of
the
fingers
were
in
existence
hence
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
forge
a
print
of
any
of
the
fingers
so
it
happens
that
the
red
resembled
one
of
the
two
prints
of
which
forgery
was
possible
in
the
fourth
place
the
red
reproduces
an
accidental
peculiarity
of
the
print
now
if
the
red
is
a
forgery
it
must
have
been
made
from
the
print
since
there
exists
no
other
print
from
which
it
could
have
been
made
hence
we
have
the
striking
fact
that
the
red
is
an
exact
replica
including
accidental
peculiarities
of
the
only
print
from
which
a
forgery
could
have
been
made
the
accidental
mark
in
the
print
is
accounted
for
by
the
condition
of
the
paper
the
occurrence
of
this
mark
in
the
red
is
not
accounted
for
by
any
peculiarity
of
the
paper
and
can
be
accounted
for
in
no
way
excepting
by
assuming
the
one
to
be
a
copy
of
the
other
the
conclusion
is
thus
inevitable
that
the
red
is
a
reproduction
of
the
print
but
there
is
yet
another
point
if
the
red
is
a
forgery
reproduced
from
the
print
the
forger
must
at
some
time
have
had
access
to
the
now
you
have
heard
remarkable
story
of
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
and
its
still
more
mysterious
reappearance
that
story
can
have
left
no
doubt
in
your
minds
that
some
person
had
surreptitiously
removed
the
and
after
an
unknown
interval
secretly
replaced
it
thus
the
theory
of
forgery
receives
confirmation
at
every
point
and
is
in
agreement
with
every
known
fact
whereas
the
theory
that
the
red
was
a
genuine
is
based
upon
a
gratuitous
assumption
and
has
not
had
a
single
fact
advanced
in
its
support
accordingly
gentlemen
i
assert
that
the
prisoner
innocence
has
been
proved
in
the
most
complete
and
convincing
manner
and
i
ask
you
for
a
verdict
in
accordance
with
that
proof
as
anstey
resumed
his
seat
a
low
rumble
of
applause
was
heard
from
the
gallery
it
subsided
instantly
on
a
gesture
of
disapproval
from
the
judge
and
a
silence
fell
upon
the
court
in
which
the
clock
with
cynical
indifference
continued
to
record
in
its
brusque
monotone
the
passage
of
the
fleeting
seconds
he
is
saved
jervis
oh
surely
he
is
saved
juliet
exclaimed
in
an
agitated
whisper
they
must
see
that
he
is
innocent
now
have
patience
a
little
longer
i
answered
it
will
soon
be
over
now
sir
hector
trumpler
was
already
on
his
feet
and
after
bestowing
on
the
jury
a
stern
hypnotic
stare
he
plunged
into
his
reply
with
a
really
admirable
air
of
conviction
and
sincerity
my
lord
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
the
case
which
is
now
before
this
court
is
one
as
i
have
already
remarked
in
which
human
nature
is
presented
in
a
highly
unfavourable
light
but
i
need
not
insist
upon
this
aspect
of
the
case
which
will
already
no
doubt
have
impressed
you
sufficiently
it
is
necessary
merely
for
me
as
my
learned
friend
has
aptly
expressed
it
to
disentangle
the
actual
facts
of
the
case
from
the
web
of
casuistry
that
has
been
woven
around
them
those
facts
are
of
extreme
simplicity
a
safe
has
been
opened
and
property
of
great
value
abstracted
from
it
it
has
been
opened
by
means
of
false
keys
now
there
are
two
men
who
have
from
time
to
time
had
possession
of
the
true
keys
and
thus
had
the
opportunity
of
making
copies
of
them
when
the
safe
is
opened
by
its
rightful
owner
the
property
is
gone
and
there
is
found
the
print
of
the
thumb
of
one
of
these
two
men
that
was
not
there
when
the
safe
was
closed
the
man
whose
is
found
is
a
man
the
print
is
the
print
of
a
left
thumb
it
would
seem
gentlemen
as
if
the
conclusion
were
so
obvious
that
no
sane
person
could
be
found
to
contest
it
and
i
submit
that
the
conclusion
which
any
sane
person
would
arrive
at
the
only
possible
conclusion
is
that
the
person
whose
was
found
in
the
safe
is
the
person
who
stole
the
property
from
the
safe
but
the
was
admittedly
that
of
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
and
therefore
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
is
the
person
who
stole
the
diamonds
from
the
safe
it
is
true
that
certain
fantastic
attempts
have
been
made
to
explain
away
these
obvious
facts
certain
scientific
theories
have
been
propounded
and
an
exhibition
of
legerdemain
has
taken
place
which
i
venture
to
think
would
have
been
more
appropriate
to
some
place
of
public
entertainment
than
to
a
court
of
justice
that
exhibition
has
no
doubt
afforded
you
considerable
amusement
it
has
furnished
a
pleasing
relaxation
from
the
serious
business
of
the
court
it
has
even
been
instructive
as
showing
to
what
extent
it
is
possible
for
plain
facts
to
be
perverted
by
misdirected
ingenuity
but
unless
you
are
prepared
to
consider
this
crime
as
an
elaborate
hoax
as
a
practical
joke
carried
out
by
a
facetious
criminal
of
extraordinary
knowledge
skill
and
general
attainments
you
must
after
all
come
to
the
only
conclusion
that
the
facts
justify
that
the
safe
was
opened
and
the
property
abstracted
by
the
prisoner
accordingly
gentlemen
i
ask
you
having
regard
to
your
important
position
as
the
guardians
of
the
and
security
of
your
to
give
your
verdict
in
accordance
with
the
evidence
as
you
have
solemnly
sworn
to
do
which
verdict
i
submit
can
be
no
other
than
that
the
prisoner
is
guilty
of
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged
sir
hector
sat
down
and
the
jury
who
had
listened
to
his
speech
with
solid
attention
gazed
expectantly
at
the
judge
as
though
they
should
say
now
which
of
these
two
are
we
to
believe
the
judge
turned
over
his
notes
with
an
air
of
quiet
composure
writing
down
a
word
here
and
there
as
he
compared
the
various
points
in
the
evidence
then
he
turned
to
the
jury
with
a
manner
at
once
persuasive
and
confidential
it
is
not
necessary
gentlemen
he
commenced
for
me
to
occupy
your
time
with
an
exhaustive
analysis
of
the
evidence
that
evidence
you
yourselves
have
heard
and
it
has
been
given
for
the
most
part
with
admirable
clearness
moreover
the
learned
counsel
for
the
defence
has
collated
and
compared
that
evidence
so
lucidly
and
i
may
say
so
impartially
that
a
detailed
repetition
on
my
part
would
be
superfluous
i
shall
therefore
confine
myself
to
a
few
comments
which
may
help
you
in
the
consideration
of
your
verdict
i
need
hardly
point
out
to
you
that
the
reference
made
by
the
learned
counsel
for
the
prosecution
to
scientific
theories
is
somewhat
misleading
the
only
evidence
of
a
theoretical
character
was
that
of
the
experts
the
evidence
of
rowe
and
of
thorndyke
dealt
exclusively
with
matters
of
fact
such
inferences
as
were
drawn
by
them
were
accompanied
by
statements
of
the
facts
which
yielded
such
inferences
now
an
examination
of
the
evidence
which
you
have
heard
shows
as
the
learned
counsel
for
the
defence
has
justly
observed
that
the
entire
case
resolves
itself
into
a
single
question
which
is
this
the
that
was
found
in
hornby
safe
made
by
the
thumb
of
the
prisoner
or
was
it
not
if
that
was
made
by
the
thumb
then
the
prisoner
must
at
least
have
been
present
when
the
safe
was
unlawfully
opened
if
that
was
not
made
by
the
prisoner
thumb
there
is
nothing
to
connect
him
with
the
crime
the
question
is
one
of
fact
upon
which
it
will
be
your
duty
to
decide
and
i
must
remind
you
gentlemen
that
you
are
the
sole
judges
of
the
facts
of
the
case
and
that
you
are
to
consider
any
remarks
of
mine
as
merely
suggestions
which
you
are
to
entertain
or
to
disregard
according
to
your
judgement
now
let
us
consider
this
question
by
the
light
of
the
evidence
this
was
either
made
by
the
prisoner
or
it
was
not
what
evidence
has
been
brought
forward
to
show
that
it
was
made
by
the
prisoner
well
there
is
the
evidence
of
the
that
pattern
is
identical
with
the
pattern
of
the
prisoner
and
even
has
the
impression
of
a
scar
which
crosses
the
pattern
in
a
particular
manner
in
the
prisoner
there
is
no
need
to
enter
into
the
elaborate
calculations
as
to
the
chances
of
agreement
the
practical
fact
which
is
not
disputed
is
that
if
this
red
is
a
genuine
at
all
it
was
made
by
the
prisoner
thumb
but
it
is
contended
that
it
is
not
a
genuine
that
it
is
a
mechanical
imitation
in
fact
a
forgery
the
more
general
question
thus
becomes
narrowed
down
to
the
more
particular
question
this
a
genuine
or
is
it
a
forgery
let
us
consider
the
evidence
first
what
evidence
is
there
that
it
is
a
genuine
there
is
none
the
identity
of
the
pattern
is
no
evidence
on
this
point
because
a
forgery
would
also
exhibit
identity
of
pattern
the
genuineness
of
the
was
assumed
by
the
prosecution
and
no
evidence
has
been
offered
but
now
what
evidence
is
there
that
the
red
is
a
forgery
first
there
is
the
question
of
size
two
prints
could
hardly
be
made
by
the
same
thumb
then
there
is
the
evidence
of
the
use
of
appliances
do
not
ordinarily
provide
themselves
with
and
rollers
with
which
to
make
distinct
impressions
of
their
own
fingers
then
there
is
the
accidental
mark
on
the
print
which
also
exists
on
the
only
genuine
print
that
could
have
been
used
for
the
purpose
of
forgery
which
is
easily
explained
on
the
theory
of
a
forgery
but
which
is
otherwise
totally
incomprehensible
finally
there
is
the
strange
disappearance
of
the
and
its
strange
reappearance
all
this
is
striking
and
weighty
evidence
to
which
must
be
added
that
adduced
by
thorndyke
as
showing
how
perfectly
it
is
possible
to
imitate
a
these
are
the
main
facts
of
the
case
and
it
is
for
you
to
consider
them
if
on
careful
consideration
you
decide
that
the
red
was
actually
made
by
the
prisoner
thumb
then
it
will
be
your
duty
to
pronounce
the
prisoner
guilty
but
if
on
weighing
the
evidence
you
decide
that
the
is
a
forgery
then
it
will
be
your
duty
to
pronounce
the
prisoner
not
guilty
it
is
now
past
the
usual
luncheon
hour
and
if
you
desire
it
you
can
retire
to
consider
your
verdict
while
the
court
adjourns
the
jurymen
whispered
together
for
a
few
moments
and
then
the
foreman
stood
up
we
have
agreed
on
our
verdict
my
lord
he
said
the
prisoner
who
had
just
been
led
to
the
back
of
the
dock
was
now
brought
back
to
the
bar
the
clerk
of
the
court
stood
up
and
addressed
the
jury
are
you
all
agreed
upon
your
verdict
gentlemen
we
are
replied
the
foreman
what
do
you
say
gentlemen
is
the
prisoner
guilty
or
not
guilty
not
guilty
replied
the
foreman
raising
his
voice
and
glancing
at
reuben
a
storm
of
applause
burst
from
the
gallery
and
was
for
the
moment
disregarded
by
the
judge
hornby
laughed
aloud
a
strange
unnatural
laugh
and
then
crammed
her
handkerchief
into
her
mouth
and
so
sat
gazing
at
reuben
with
the
tears
coursing
down
her
face
while
juliet
laid
her
head
upon
the
desk
and
sobbed
silently
after
a
brief
space
the
judge
raised
an
admonitory
hand
and
when
the
commotion
had
subsided
addressed
the
prisoner
who
stood
at
the
bar
calm
and
though
his
face
bore
a
slight
flush
reuben
hornby
the
jury
after
duly
weighing
the
evidence
in
this
case
have
found
you
to
be
not
guilty
of
the
crime
with
which
you
were
charged
with
that
verdict
i
most
heartily
agree
in
view
of
the
evidence
which
has
been
given
i
consider
that
no
other
verdict
was
possible
and
i
venture
to
say
that
you
leave
this
court
with
your
innocence
fully
established
and
without
a
stain
upon
your
character
in
the
distress
which
you
have
recently
suffered
as
well
as
in
your
rejoicing
at
the
verdict
of
the
jury
you
have
the
sympathy
of
the
court
and
of
everyone
present
and
that
sympathy
will
not
be
diminished
by
the
consideration
that
with
a
less
capable
defence
the
result
might
have
been
very
different
i
desire
to
express
my
admiration
at
the
manner
in
which
that
defence
was
conducted
and
i
desire
especially
to
observe
that
not
you
alone
but
the
public
at
large
are
deeply
indebted
to
thorndyke
who
by
his
insight
his
knowledge
and
his
ingenuity
has
probably
averted
a
very
serious
miscarriage
of
justice
the
court
will
now
adjourn
until
two
the
judge
rose
from
his
seat
and
everyone
present
stood
up
and
amidst
the
clamour
of
many
feet
upon
the
gallery
stairs
the
door
of
the
dock
was
thrown
open
by
a
smiling
police
officer
and
reuben
came
down
the
stairs
into
the
body
of
the
court
chapter
xvii
at
last
we
had
better
let
the
people
clear
off
said
thorndyke
when
the
first
greetings
were
over
and
we
stood
around
reuben
in
the
court
we
do
want
a
demonstration
as
we
go
out
no
anything
but
that
just
now
replied
reuben
he
still
held
hornby
hand
and
one
arm
was
passed
through
that
of
his
uncle
who
wiped
his
eyes
at
intervals
though
his
face
glowed
with
delight
i
should
like
you
to
come
and
have
a
little
quiet
luncheon
with
me
at
my
chambers
all
of
us
friends
together
continued
thorndyke
i
should
be
delighted
said
reuben
if
the
programme
would
include
a
satisfactory
you
will
come
anstey
asked
thorndyke
what
have
you
got
for
lunch
demanded
anstey
who
was
now
disrobed
and
in
his
right
mind
that
is
to
say
in
his
usual
whimsical
character
that
question
savours
of
gluttony
answered
thorndyke
come
and
see
i
will
come
and
eat
which
is
better
answered
anstey
and
i
must
run
off
now
as
i
have
to
look
in
at
my
chambers
how
shall
we
go
asked
thorndyke
as
his
colleague
vanished
through
the
doorway
polton
has
gone
for
a
but
it
wo
hold
us
all
it
will
hold
four
of
us
said
reuben
and
jervis
will
bring
juliet
wo
you
jervis
the
request
rather
took
me
aback
considering
the
circumstances
but
i
was
conscious
nevertheless
of
an
unreasonable
thrill
of
pleasure
and
answered
with
alacrity
if
miss
gibson
will
allow
me
i
shall
be
very
delighted
my
delight
was
apparently
not
shared
by
juliet
to
judge
by
the
uncomfortable
blush
that
spread
over
her
face
she
made
no
objection
however
but
merely
replied
rather
coldly
well
as
we
sit
on
the
roof
of
the
cab
we
had
better
go
by
ourselves
the
crowd
having
by
this
time
presumably
cleared
off
we
all
took
our
way
downstairs
the
cab
was
waiting
at
the
kerb
surrounded
by
a
group
of
spectators
who
cheered
reuben
as
he
appeared
at
the
doorway
and
we
saw
our
friends
enter
and
drive
away
then
we
turned
and
walked
quickly
down
the
old
bailey
towards
ludgate
hill
shall
we
take
a
hansom
i
asked
no
let
us
walk
replied
juliet
a
little
fresh
air
will
do
us
good
after
that
musty
horrible
court
it
all
seems
like
a
dream
and
yet
what
a
relief
oh
what
a
relief
it
is
it
is
rather
like
the
awakening
from
a
nightmare
to
find
the
morning
sun
shining
i
rejoined
yes
that
is
just
what
it
is
like
she
agreed
but
i
still
feel
dazed
and
shaken
we
turned
presently
down
new
bridge
street
towards
the
embankment
walking
side
by
side
without
speaking
and
i
could
not
help
comparing
with
some
bitterness
our
present
stiff
and
distant
relations
with
the
intimacy
and
comradeship
that
had
existed
before
the
miserable
incident
of
our
last
meeting
you
do
look
so
jubilant
over
your
success
as
i
should
have
expected
she
said
at
length
with
a
critical
glance
at
me
but
i
expect
you
are
really
very
proud
and
delighted
are
you
delighted
yes
not
proud
why
should
i
be
proud
i
have
only
played
jackal
and
even
that
i
have
done
very
badly
that
is
hardly
a
fair
statement
of
the
facts
she
rejoined
with
another
quick
inquisitive
look
at
me
but
you
are
in
low
spirits
which
is
not
at
all
like
you
is
it
not
so
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
selfish
egotistical
brute
was
my
gloomy
reply
i
ought
to
be
as
gay
and
joyful
as
everyone
else
whereas
the
fact
is
that
i
am
chafing
over
my
own
petty
troubles
you
see
now
that
this
case
is
finished
my
engagement
with
thorndyke
terminates
automatically
and
i
relapse
into
my
old
life
a
dreary
repetition
of
journeying
amongst
strangers
and
the
prospect
is
not
inspiriting
this
has
been
a
time
of
bitter
trial
to
you
but
to
me
it
has
been
a
green
oasis
in
the
desert
of
a
colourless
monotonous
life
i
have
enjoyed
the
companionship
of
a
most
lovable
man
whom
i
admire
and
respect
above
all
other
men
and
with
him
have
moved
in
scenes
full
of
colour
and
interest
and
i
have
made
one
other
friend
whom
i
am
loth
to
see
fade
out
of
my
life
as
she
seems
likely
to
do
if
you
mean
me
said
juliet
i
may
say
that
it
will
be
your
own
fault
if
i
fade
out
of
your
life
i
can
never
forget
all
that
you
have
done
for
us
your
loyalty
to
reuben
your
enthusiasm
in
his
cause
to
say
nothing
of
your
many
kindnesses
to
me
and
as
to
your
having
done
your
work
badly
you
wrong
yourself
grievously
i
recognised
in
the
evidence
by
which
reuben
was
cleared
how
much
you
had
done
in
filling
in
the
details
towards
making
the
case
complete
and
convincing
i
shall
always
feel
that
we
owe
you
a
debt
of
the
deepest
gratitude
and
so
will
reuben
and
so
perhaps
more
than
either
of
us
will
someone
else
and
who
is
that
i
asked
though
with
no
great
interest
the
gratitude
of
the
family
was
a
matter
of
little
consequence
to
me
well
it
is
no
secret
now
replied
juliet
i
mean
the
girl
whom
reuben
is
going
to
marry
what
is
the
matter
dr
jervis
she
added
in
a
tone
of
surprise
we
were
passing
through
the
gate
that
leads
from
the
embankment
to
middle
temple
lane
and
i
had
stopped
dead
under
the
archway
laying
a
detaining
hand
upon
her
arm
and
gazing
at
her
in
utter
amazement
the
girl
that
reuben
is
going
to
marry
i
repeated
why
i
had
always
taken
it
for
granted
that
he
was
going
to
marry
you
but
i
told
you
most
explicitly
that
was
not
so
she
exclaimed
with
some
impatience
i
know
you
did
i
admitted
ruefully
but
i
thought
well
i
imagined
that
things
had
perhaps
not
gone
quite
smoothly
and
did
you
suppose
that
if
i
had
cared
for
a
man
and
that
man
had
been
under
a
cloud
i
should
have
denied
the
relation
or
pretended
that
we
were
merely
friends
she
demanded
indignantly
i
am
sure
you
would
i
replied
hastily
i
was
a
fool
an
idiot
by
jove
what
an
idiot
i
have
been
it
was
certainly
very
silly
of
you
she
admitted
but
there
was
a
gentleness
in
her
tone
that
took
away
all
bitterness
from
the
reproach
the
reason
of
the
secrecy
was
this
she
continued
they
became
engaged
the
very
night
before
reuben
was
arrested
and
when
he
heard
of
the
charge
against
him
he
insisted
that
no
one
should
be
told
unless
and
until
he
was
fully
acquitted
i
was
the
only
person
who
was
in
their
confidence
and
as
i
was
sworn
to
secrecy
of
course
i
tell
you
nor
did
i
suppose
that
the
matter
would
interest
you
why
should
it
imbecile
that
i
am
i
murmured
if
i
had
only
known
well
if
you
known
said
she
what
difference
could
it
have
made
to
you
this
question
she
asked
without
looking
at
me
but
i
noted
that
her
cheek
had
grown
a
shade
paler
only
this
i
answered
that
i
should
have
been
spared
many
a
day
and
night
of
needless
and
misery
but
why
she
asked
still
keeping
her
face
averted
what
had
you
to
reproach
yourself
with
a
great
deal
i
answered
if
you
consider
my
supposed
position
if
you
think
of
me
as
the
trusted
agent
of
a
man
helpless
and
deeply
wronged
a
man
whose
undeserved
misfortunes
made
every
demand
upon
chivalry
and
generosity
if
you
think
of
me
as
being
called
upon
to
protect
and
carry
comfort
to
the
woman
whom
i
regarded
as
virtually
that
man
betrothed
wife
and
then
if
you
think
of
me
as
proceeding
straightway
before
i
had
known
her
hours
to
fall
hopelessly
in
love
with
her
myself
you
will
admit
that
i
had
something
to
reproach
myself
with
she
was
still
silent
rather
pale
and
very
thoughtful
and
she
seemed
to
breathe
more
quickly
than
usual
of
course
i
continued
you
may
say
that
it
was
my
own
that
i
had
only
to
keep
my
own
counsel
and
no
one
would
be
any
the
worse
but
there
the
mischief
of
it
how
can
a
man
who
is
thinking
of
a
woman
morning
noon
and
night
whose
heart
leaps
at
the
sound
of
her
coming
whose
existence
is
a
blank
when
she
is
away
from
him
a
blank
which
he
tries
to
fill
by
recalling
again
and
again
all
that
she
has
said
and
the
tones
of
her
voice
and
the
look
that
was
in
her
eyes
when
she
spoke
how
can
he
help
letting
her
see
sooner
or
later
that
he
cares
for
her
and
if
he
does
when
he
has
no
right
to
there
is
an
end
of
duty
and
chivalry
and
even
common
honesty
yes
i
understand
now
said
juliet
softly
is
this
the
way
she
tripped
up
the
steps
leading
to
fountain
court
and
i
followed
cheerfully
of
course
it
was
not
the
way
and
we
both
knew
it
but
the
place
was
silent
and
peaceful
and
the
cast
a
pleasant
shade
on
the
gravelled
court
i
glanced
at
her
as
we
walked
slowly
towards
the
fountain
the
roses
were
mantling
in
her
cheeks
now
and
her
eyes
were
cast
down
but
when
she
lifted
them
to
me
for
an
instant
i
saw
that
they
were
shining
and
moist
did
you
never
guess
i
asked
yes
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
i
guessed
but
but
then
she
added
shyly
i
thought
i
had
guessed
wrong
we
walked
on
for
some
little
time
without
speaking
again
until
we
came
to
the
further
side
of
the
fountain
where
we
stood
listening
to
the
quiet
trickle
of
the
water
and
watching
the
sparrows
as
they
took
their
bath
on
the
rim
of
the
basin
a
little
way
off
another
group
of
sparrows
had
gathered
with
greedy
joy
around
some
fragments
of
bread
that
had
been
scattered
abroad
by
the
benevolent
templars
and
hard
by
a
more
pigeon
unmindful
of
the
crumbs
and
the
marauding
sparrows
puffed
out
his
breast
and
strutted
and
curtsied
before
his
mate
with
endearing
gurgles
juliet
had
rested
her
hand
on
one
of
the
little
posts
that
support
the
chain
by
which
the
fountain
is
enclosed
and
i
had
laid
my
hand
on
hers
presently
she
turned
her
hand
over
so
that
mine
lay
in
its
palm
and
so
we
were
standing
when
an
elderly
gentleman
of
dry
and
legal
aspect
came
up
the
steps
and
passed
by
the
fountain
he
looked
at
the
pigeons
and
then
he
looked
at
us
and
went
his
way
smiling
and
shaking
his
head
juliet
said
i
she
looked
up
quickly
with
sparkling
eyes
and
a
frank
smile
that
was
yet
a
little
shy
too
yes
why
did
he
smile
that
old
gentleman
when
he
looked
at
us
i
ca
imagine
she
replied
mendaciously
it
was
an
approving
smile
i
said
i
think
he
was
remembering
his
own
and
giving
us
his
blessing
perhaps
he
was
she
agreed
he
looked
a
nice
old
thing
she
gazed
fondly
at
the
retreating
figure
and
then
turned
again
to
me
her
cheeks
had
grown
pink
enough
by
now
and
in
one
of
them
a
dimple
displayed
itself
to
great
advantage
in
its
rosy
setting
can
you
forgive
me
dear
for
my
unutterable
folly
i
asked
presently
as
she
glanced
up
at
me
again
i
am
not
sure
she
answered
it
was
dreadfully
silly
of
you
but
remember
juliet
that
i
loved
you
with
my
whole
heart
as
i
love
you
now
and
shall
love
you
always
i
can
forgive
you
anything
when
you
say
that
she
answered
softly
here
the
voice
of
the
distant
temple
clock
was
heard
uttering
a
polite
protest
with
infinite
reluctance
we
turned
away
from
the
fountain
which
sprinkled
us
with
a
parting
benediction
and
slowly
retraced
our
steps
to
middle
temple
lane
and
thence
into
pump
court
you
have
said
it
juliet
i
whispered
as
we
came
through
the
archway
into
the
silent
deserted
court
have
i
dear
she
answered
but
you
know
it
do
you
you
know
i
do
yes
i
know
i
said
and
that
knowledge
is
all
my
heart
desire
she
laid
her
hand
in
mine
for
a
moment
with
a
gentle
pressure
and
then
drew
it
away
and
so
we
passed
through
into
the
cloisters
the
end
