among

this
one
will
always
occupy
a
particularly
warm
spot
in
my
heart
for
listen
reader
and
i
will
let
you
into
a
little
secret
riddle
creek
is
really
ridley
and
is
a
stream
flowing
through
one
of
the
most
charming
regions
in
delaware
county
pennsylvania
the
railroad
trestle
which
plays
such
an
important
part
in
the
first
chapter
forms
a
picturesque
feature
of
the
landscape
in
full
view
of
a
home
where
i
was
wont
to
spend
many
a
joyous
and
which
i
had
in
mind
whenever
i
mentioned
the
pellery
again
the
odd
little
house
on
seventh
street
philadelphia
described
in
chapter
xxvii
actually
existed
until
pulled
down
some
years
since
to
make
room
for
a
big
manufacturing
plant
i
used
to
visit
there
every
time
i
went
to
the
quaker
city
and
all
the
furnishings
mentioned
stand
out
vividly
in
my
recollection
to
this
day
even
to
the
guitar
off
in
one
corner
i
never
played
fish
pond
there
but
i
have
eaten
some
of
the
best
dinners
i
ever
tasted
in
that
famous
kitchen
below
stairs
which
had
to
serve
for
dining
room
as
well
that
kitchen
and
the
great
cat
who
used
to
sun
himself
in
the
shop
window
loom
large
in
my
memories
of
boyhood
matthew
white
york
chapter
i
the
man
on
the
bridge
there
i
believe
that
man
is
actually
going
to
try
to
cross
the
roy
pell
pulled
his
sister
eva
quickly
toward
him
as
he
spoke
so
that
she
could
look
up
between
the
trees
to
the
burdock
side
of
the
railway
bridge
almost
directly
above
their
heads
tyler
exclaimed
jess
who
had
a
better
view
from
where
she
sat
on
the
log
that
spanned
riddle
creek
roy
sure
to
happen
to
him
awfully
a
train
almost
due
added
eva
can
he
be
thinking
of
to
attempt
such
a
thing
and
jess
gave
a
shrill
scream
fallen
roy
said
never
a
word
he
quickly
passed
his
to
eva
ran
nimbly
across
the
tree
trunk
to
the
burdock
side
of
the
creek
and
then
started
to
climb
the
steep
bank
the
girls
sat
there
and
watched
him
breathlessly
now
and
then
darting
a
look
higher
up
at
the
spot
on
the
trestle
where
the
figure
that
had
dropped
still
lay
across
the
ties
as
if
too
badly
hurt
to
rise
the
two
pell
girls
and
their
twin
brothers
rex
and
roy
had
gone
down
to
sit
on
the
log
in
search
of
coolness
on
this
blazing
hot
july
afternoon
rex
had
been
giving
vent
to
his
disgust
because
he
able
to
accept
the
invitation
to
join
a
jolly
party
of
friends
for
a
trip
to
lake
george
and
down
the
lawrence
cause
why
lack
of
funds
ought
to
have
known
you
go
when
scott
asked
you
rex
roy
had
told
him
would
need
at
least
fifty
dollars
for
the
outing
and
that
sum
will
clothe
you
for
almost
a
year
and
clothes
with
you
rex
ought
to
be
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
suppose
i
might
as
well
go
and
tell
scott
about
it
and
have
it
over
with
rex
had
replied
creasing
his
handsome
forehead
into
a
frown
dare
say
be
calling
me
have
it
pretty
soon
it
was
only
two
months
ago
i
asked
for
a
bicycle
and
get
it
and
there
was
the
new
pair
of
skates
i
wanted
last
be
late
for
tea
eva
called
out
after
him
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
shore
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
trim
figure
till
it
was
hidden
by
the
trees
which
grew
thick
along
the
road
that
led
up
to
town
if
anybody
in
this
world
ought
to
have
money
it
is
that
good
looking
brother
of
ours
remarked
jess
with
a
sigh
appreciate
it
so
thoroughly
i
wonder
crabbed
this
afternoon
just
think
of
the
chance
for
a
good
time
had
to
let
slip
just
for
lack
of
a
little
dollars
a
little
money
jess
returned
roy
casting
his
line
know
it
to
us
but
it
is
to
most
of
the
people
we
know
scott
bowman
for
instance
do
you
suppose
we
shall
be
rich
roy
are
rich
now
at
least
you
and
eva
are
in
my
rich
eva
nearly
slipped
from
her
position
on
the
log
at
the
statement
yes
you
both
contented
dispositions
and
that
worth
a
small
fortune
why
have
you
left
yourself
out
roy
eva
wanted
to
know
you
who
never
grumble
are
satisfied
with
a
flash
came
into
the
eyes
that
made
him
really
handsome
for
the
moment
chafing
inwardly
all
the
while
at
having
to
be
idle
this
way
when
it
seems
there
ought
to
be
so
much
i
could
do
to
help
you
are
getting
ready
to
do
it
as
soon
as
you
finish
school
rejoined
his
sister
you
must
have
a
vacation
you
know
besides
think
how
much
you
do
to
help
i
only
do
a
little
copying
for
him
now
and
he
was
going
to
add
more
but
at
this
point
he
caught
that
glimpse
of
the
man
on
the
trestle
which
brought
about
the
interruption
in
the
talk
already
described
roy
soon
emerged
from
the
line
of
shade
in
his
climb
up
the
embankment
and
the
scorching
afternoon
sun
beat
down
on
him
mercilessly
but
he
did
not
cease
his
exertions
to
reach
the
top
as
quickly
as
possible
he
knew
that
a
train
for
the
city
would
be
along
very
soon
now
he
remembered
the
curve
just
beyond
the
bridge
the
engineer
could
not
see
whether
there
was
an
obstruction
in
the
way
until
he
should
be
too
close
on
it
to
stop
then
he
thought
of
tyler
and
of
how
nobody
liked
him
with
all
his
money
which
he
hoarded
like
a
miser
he
was
probably
crossing
the
bridge
now
to
take
the
train
for
the
city
from
marley
and
save
the
additional
five
cents
he
might
have
to
pay
if
he
boarded
it
at
burdock
which
was
much
nearer
his
home
but
he
was
human
he
was
an
old
man
he
was
helpless
now
doubtless
overcome
by
the
heat
and
there
was
nobody
about
but
roy
to
prevent
what
might
be
a
tragedy
on
he
toiled
the
loose
dirt
slid
out
from
under
his
feet
and
rattled
down
the
hillside
behind
him
the
perspiration
poured
from
his
face
in
streams
what
a
contrast
this
was
he
thought
to
sitting
there
over
the
creek
placidly
fishing
he
had
gained
the
top
now
and
scarcely
pausing
to
take
a
long
breath
he
ran
out
over
the
ties
till
he
reached
prostrate
form
he
had
fallen
fortunately
not
very
far
from
the
beginning
of
the
trestle
but
he
was
quite
unconscious
and
could
not
help
himself
roy
must
carry
him
away
from
his
dangerous
position
he
bent
to
his
task
which
was
not
such
an
arduous
one
as
might
be
supposed
tyler
was
little
more
than
a
bag
of
bones
weighing
not
as
much
as
did
roy
himself
the
latter
picked
him
up
as
carefully
as
he
could
not
daring
to
look
down
lest
he
should
grow
dizzy
then
he
began
to
bear
his
burden
back
to
he
had
almost
reached
the
ground
when
the
old
man
stirred
and
opened
his
eyes
he
started
to
struggle
but
roy
looked
down
at
him
and
spoke
sternly
quiet
tyler
he
said
you
will
have
us
both
over
the
the
miser
shuddered
but
he
made
no
reply
and
kept
perfectly
still
till
roy
placed
him
on
the
grass
in
the
shade
of
a
horse
chestnut
tree
the
boy
threw
himself
down
beside
him
and
began
to
fan
himself
with
his
straw
hat
the
next
minute
with
a
shrill
whistle
the
train
rushed
by
them
saved
my
life
roy
pell
said
tyler
after
the
skurrying
dust
raised
from
the
ballast
had
settled
into
place
are
a
brave
roy
made
no
reply
he
was
still
very
hot
and
he
was
thinking
that
his
whole
adventure
was
very
much
like
a
scene
in
a
book
ought
to
say
it
is
nothing
i
suppose
he
reflected
with
a
half
smile
then
that
be
the
truth
from
the
way
i
feel
now
it
was
a
good
missed
that
train
i
suppose
tyler
went
on
at
this
roy
wanted
to
laugh
it
sounded
so
ridiculous
and
yet
it
was
quite
characteristic
of
this
singular
old
man
but
young
pell
mopped
his
face
vigorously
with
his
handkerchief
to
hide
his
mirth
and
then
said
rising
to
his
feet
you
feel
all
right
tyler
i
guess
so
was
the
reply
and
the
old
man
started
to
get
up
too
but
he
immediately
fell
back
again
and
a
frightened
look
came
into
his
face
chapter
ii
in
the
home
you
hurt
yourself
tyler
asked
roy
anxiously
break
a
limb
when
you
fell
did
you
no
it
is
here
and
the
old
man
put
his
hand
up
to
his
head
sun
was
too
hot
for
you
went
on
roy
got
over
it
am
afraid
i
shall
never
get
over
it
roy
the
miser
looked
at
him
in
a
steady
way
that
would
have
frightened
some
boys
i
want
to
die
yet
not
till
i
have
made
my
will
i
must
have
a
lawyer
where
is
sydney
pell
that
brother
of
my
brother
a
boy
that
father
adopted
when
he
was
very
young
but
better
than
a
good
many
brothers
and
a
good
lawyer
too
would
you
like
to
see
him
be
back
on
the
i
should
like
to
see
him
if
it
be
too
late
what
time
is
it
now
you
got
a
watch
have
you
look
at
mine
and
tell
past
five
and
now
you
ought
to
be
taken
home
right
away
and
have
a
think
i
am
very
bad
then
again
the
frightened
look
came
into
the
old
face
of
course
not
lots
of
people
have
to
call
the
doctor
when
not
going
to
speak
of
dying
afraid
to
die
see
i
mind
telling
you
so
and
i
ought
to
be
i
done
very
much
good
in
the
world
there
anybody
i
can
think
of
will
be
sorry
to
have
me
go
that
the
way
to
live
roy
pell
you
ought
to
be
happy
so
happy
because
you
are
young
and
have
your
life
before
you
to
make
it
the
way
it
should
be
have
life
before
you
too
tyler
you
are
not
so
very
old
not
much
more
than
but
come
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
up
with
your
help

want
you
to
take
me
home
so
you
can
go
for
sydney
a
good
boy
you
say
one
i
can
trust
the
old
man
looked
in
face
closely
as
the
latter
bent
over
him
is
the
best
fellow
that
ever
lived
replied
roy
soberly
been
a
staff
to
my
mother
ever
since
father
died
and
has
almost
taken
his
place
to
us
yes
heard
that
what
your
father
did
for
him
years
ago
was
like
bread
cast
upon
the
waters
coming
back
after
many
days
let
me
see
how
old
are
you
i
tell
you
what
tyler
the
girls
are
down
under
the
bridge
wait
a
minute
till
i
call
down
to
them
to
send
syd
over
as
soon
as
he
comes
then
go
home
with
you
and
leave
right
very
good
to
me
roy
the
miser
sank
back
on
the
grass
while
roy
hurried
to
the
edge
of
the
bluff
and
making
a
trumpet
of
his
hands
called
down
jess
are
you
all
right
roy
came
back
the
answer
in
tones
but
a
little
done
up
going
home
with
him
and
he
wants
you
to
send
syd
over
as
soon
as
he
gets
back
some
business
matter
quite
important
and
we
may
both
be
late
for
tea
wait
do
you
understand
all
right
go
to
meet
syd
now
shall
we
send
the
doctor
too
roy
thought
a
minute
i
think
better
he
called
down
told
them
to
send
the
doctor
to
your
house
he
reported
to
tyler
he
half
expected
the
latter
to
raise
a
protest
but
he
right
he
said
feebly
do
for
one
of
the
witnesses
roy
bent
down
so
that
the
old
man
might
lean
on
his
shoulder
he
put
one
arm
about
his
back
to
steady
him
and
thus
supported
he
was
able
to
move
slowly
along
the
cinder
path
beside
the
track
did
you
attempt
to
walk
across
the
trestle
for
tyler
asked
roy
made
up
my
mind
suddenly
to
go
to
town
was
the
answer
time
to
go
around
by
the
turnpike
i
thought
i
could
get
across
before
the
train
came
seen
boys
go
over
not
a
boy
rejoined
roy
with
a
smile
not
a
boy
and
roy
could
feel
a
shudder
pass
through
the
arm
that
was
resting
on
his
shoulder
tyler
lived
in
a
house
not
far
from
the
burdock
station
an
old
woman
did
the
cooking
for
him
and
went
home
at
night
for
the
rest
he
dwelt
almost
like
a
hermit
and
so
far
as
any
one
knew
he
had
not
a
relative
in
the
world
but
the
report
had
gone
out
as
it
always
does
in
such
cases
that
he
was
very
rich
and
now
his
desire
to
see
a
lawyer
and
make
a
will
convinced
roy
that
for
once
rumor
must
be
right
wonder
how
much
got
and
to
whom
leave
it
he
asked
himself
but
now
they
were
within
sight
of
the
little
house
and
the
old
man
leaned
so
heavily
upon
him
that
all
his
attention
was
centered
on
getting
him
safely
to
the
end
of
their
journey
by
the
time
this
was
accomplished
tyler
was
so
completely
exhausted
that
he
dropped
down
on
the
first
chair
they
reached
you
are
rested
a
bit
said
roy
help
you
to
get
to
no
protested
the
old
man
many
people
die
in
their
beds
go
and
tell
ann
to
get
a
little
more
for
dinner
you
and
sydney
must
stay
and
eat
it
with
me
it
will
take
quite
a
time
to
have
my
will
drawn
up
find
her
in
the
the
woman
was
not
much
surprised
when
roy
told
her
of
the
condition
in
which
her
master
had
come
home
what
been
expecting
every
day
she
said
eat
enough
to
keep
a
bird
alive
amazed
to
think
he
should
ask
you
to
stop
to
dinner
little
enough
get
master
roy
but
do
my
the
house
was
a
bare
looking
place
furnished
only
with
the
merest
necessities
no
pictures
were
on
the
walls
no
books
on
the
tables
roy
wondered
what
the
old
man
did
to
pass
the
time
here
by
himself
there
was
not
even
a
sofa
for
him
to
lie
upon
he
asked
about
this
when
he
returned
to
the
front
room
better
come
in
and
lie
on
the
outside
of
your
bed
if
you
get
in
it
he
suggested
to
this
the
older
man
acceded
and
allowed
roy
to
assist
him
to
the
adjoining
apartment
where
he
slept
he
murmured
wasted
much
on
myself
you
see
that
will
leave
still
more
for
those
who
come
after
me
what
would
you
do
with
if
you
had
it
roy
pell
the
question
came
so
suddenly
and
in
such
contrasted
tones
to
the
mumble
in
which
the
miser
had
heretofore
been
speaking
that
for
the
moment
roy
was
too
startled
to
make
reply
not
raving
roy
pell
went
on
the
old
man
a
he
checked
himself
would
you
do
with
all
that
money
if
you
had
it
give
it
to
my
mother
answered
roy
boy
of
course
i
think
of
that
a
minor
and
not
selfish
rather
she
would
have
it
eh
than
that
it
should
be
held
by
her
in
trust
for
you
but
if
you
got
it
promise
to
see
that
it
was
spent
and
not
hoarded
as
i
have
hoarded
mine
promise
that
you
roy
by
this
time
began
to
think
that
the
partial
sunstroke
had
completely
unhinged
brain
already
a
little
out
of
plumb
yes
he
laughed
no
danger
of
our
hoarding
money
there
are
too
many
things
to
spend
it
on
for
squeezed
a
little
down
at
your
place
eh
we
can
get
along
returned
roy
hastily
we
do
much
branching
out
my
mother
has
only
the
income
from
insurance
and
then
the
place
which
we
own
with
the
taxes
to
the
old
man
now
relapsed
into
silence
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
suddenly
he
started
up
and
exclaimed
must
be
nearly
time
for
sydney
to
be
here
you
go
outside
and
watch
for
him
roy
was
very
glad
to
leave
the
miser
he
realized
that
perhaps
it
was
wrong
for
him
to
feel
that
way
but
then
believing
him
to
be
a
little
unbalanced
it
was
but
natural
that
he
should
be
sensible
of
some
constraint
in
his
presence
wonder
if
he
has
got
put
away
somewhere
he
asked
himself
when
he
reached
the
little
portico
talked
exactly
as
if
he
was
going
to
give
it
to
me
i
suppose
for
what
i
did
for
him
on
the
bridge
that
would
be
just
like
a
story
episode
so
much
like
one
that
no
chance
of
its
coming
true
but
what
would
rex
say
if
it
did
ah
here
comes
roy
left
the
porch
and
hurried
out
to
the
gate
to
meet
the
fellow
who
had
been
nearer
and
dearer
to
him
than
a
brother
as
far
back
as
he
could
remember
old
chap
he
said
as
they
met
and
he
turned
around
slipping
his
arm
within
that
of
the
tall
young
lawyer
was
a
shame
to
make
you
walk
all
that
distance
in
the
hot
sun
when
you
must
be
tired
out
from
your
day
in
town
but
a
job
at
the
end
of
the
a
cheerful
brother
too
added
the
other
rex
i
saw
him
over
at
the
station
he
takes
it
terribly
to
heart
that
he
can
not
go
off
with
the
bowmans
i
wish
i
were
rich
if
only
for
you
sakes
but
this
heroic
deed
i
hear
of
your
doing
for
old
tyler
positively
roy
proud
of
the
train
come
along
for
a
good
five
minutes
after
got
him
off
the
trestle
you
see
that
takes
a
good
deal
of
the
business
out
of
the
thing
but
come
on
inside
been
quite
anxious
to
see
you
made
him
lie
down
for
i
think
in
a
very
bad
chapter
iii
will
that
you
sydney
pell
called
out
tyler
as
soon
as
he
heard
footsteps
in
the
hallway
tyler
what
can
i
do
for
you
and
sydney
followed
roy
into
the
bedroom
can
make
my
will
replied
the
old
man
promptly
mean
that
i
am
going
to
die
right
away
he
added
hastily
had
a
warning
why
i
may
have
time
to
make
two
or
three
wills
before
i
give
up
the
he
laughed
hoarsely
and
started
to
get
up
but
he
was
weaker
than
he
supposed
and
fell
back
on
the
bed
with
a
little
gasp
just
as
he
had
done
out
by
the
trestle
exert
yourself
too
much
tyler
said
sydney
can
fix
the
thing
up
for
you
while
you
are
lying
right
here
i
think
i
saw
a
bottle
of
ink
and
some
paper
in
the
other
room
roy
can
help
me
bring
in
that
table
that
stands
there
and
then
i
can
take
down
whatever
you
wish
and
you
can
sign
it
but
you
will
want
ann
she
can
be
one
responded
the
old
man
i
told
the
girls
to
send
a
doctor
up
here
he
can
be
another
put
in
roy
then
he
added
when
all
was
arranged
suppose
i
had
better
go
you
can
go
out
and
watch
for
the
doctor
said
sydney
then
he
went
on
turning
to
tyler
when
they
were
alone
and
after
he
had
written
out
the
regulation
formal
preamble
am
the
miser
said
nothing
in
reply
for
a
minute
or
two
he
kept
interlocking
his
wasted
fingers
with
one
another
glancing
now
and
then
out
of
the
window
where
he
could
see
roy
pacing
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
cottage
finally
he
murmured
so
low
that
sydney
was
obliged
to
bend
forward
to
catch
the
words
you
be
surprised
to
hear
that
i
had
a
vast
amount
of
money
in
the
deposit
companies
in
philadelphia
tyler
replied
sydney
has
always
been
supposed
that
you
were
a
man
of
am
i
am
muttered
the
miser
have
something
like
half
a
million
and
yet
what
good
has
it
done
me
i
have
hoarded
it
just
for
the
sake
of
hoarding
it
began
to
come
to
me
when
i
was
quite
young
i
was
surprised
some
property
was
wanted
by
the
city
they
paid
me
well
for
it
i
invested
what
i
got
and
doubled
it
i
kept
on
making
money
till
i
loved
it
for
itself
alone
and
could
not
bear
to
part
with
it
even
on
the
chance
of
making
more
so
i
left
it
all
to
draw
interest
except
what
little
it
takes
to
support
me
in
the
poor
way
in
which
i
he
paused
and
sydney
adjudged
it
proper
to
inquire
you
have
no
relatives
no
one
dependent
on
you
have
outlived
them
all
was
the
reply
was
a
boy
though
who
was
once
in
my
employ
and
whom
i
came
to
think
a
good
deal
of
but
he
grew
up
and
went
into
stocks
and
tried
to
bear
the
market
against
me
i
never
forgave
maurice
darley
for
that
and
yet
i
loved
him
once
i
brought
him
up
out
of
the
gutter
as
it
were
and
there
was
a
time
when
he
loved
me
there
is
another
brother
in
your
family
whom
i
see
sometimes
and
who
reminds
me
of
as
we
call
mean
but
perhaps
he
would
not
have
done
for
me
what
roy
did
this
afternoon
you
have
heard
of
it
he
risked
his
life
for
mine
he
will
make
a
good
man
i
am
sure
of
it
and
he
is
unselfish
to
make
him
happy
you
must
make
others
happy
around
him
yes
i
will
do
it
quick
write
down
that
i
leave
all
my
fortune
unreservedly
is
his
full
name
full
name
sydney
had
dropped
his
pen
and
sat
staring
at
tyler
as
if
in
a
daze
your
fillmore
pell
sydney
repeated
the
name
mechanically
still
too
amazed
at
the
inference
he
must
draw
from
the
question
to
be
really
conscious
of
what
he
was
saying
you
a
fine
name
it
is
and
fitted
to
a
splendid
boy
then
no
i
had
determined
not
to
leave
it
to
him
what
is
his
name
she
must
have
it
all
outright
then
it
can
be
used
at
once
in
the
way
to
please
roy
best
now
full
name
fillmore
pell
i
suppose
as
a
lawyer
i
ought
not
to
express
any
surprise
at
what
you
are
doing
but
you
can
see
how
close
home
it
comes
to
me
tyler
you
know
the
relation
in
which
i
stand
to
this
family
with
whom
i
am
connected
by
no
ties
of
blood
but
who
have
been
so
good
to
you
have
deserved
it
young
man
i
am
not
leaving
money
to
a
family
of
whom
i
know
nothing
have
you
got
that
all
my
fortune
unreservedly
to
jessica
fillmore
pell
knows
something
of
this
and
if
people
think
it
strange
or
hint
that
i
am
out
of
my
head
to
leave
my
money
in
this
way
you
can
tell
them
what
he
did
for
me
this
afternoon
that
ought
to
satisfy
them
now
i
want
to
tell
you
where
my
money
is
invested
so
that
you
can
get
at
it
easily
for
i
want
you
sydney
to
be
one
of
my
executors
and
i
will
take
martin
for
the
other
here
he
comes
now
we
will
continue
this
business
roy
came
in
with
the
doctor
a
cheery
man
whom
everybody
in
the
neighborhood
liked
began
tyler
before
the
physician
could
say
anything
want
you
to
witness
my
will
roy
run
out
to
the
kitchen
and
get
ann
to
come
in
said
roy
appearing
in
the
rear
regions
tyler
wants
you
to
come
out
and
witness
his
the
poor
man
dying
then
exclaimed
the
woman
looking
frightened
no
he
mind
bothering
ann
about
that
now
said
the
doctor
presenting
himself
at
this
moment
roy
returned
to
the
bedroom
with
the
physician
where
he
found
that
tyler
had
decided
he
would
have
sydney
for
a
witness
in
place
of
ann
rather
have
a
man
he
explained
forgot
that
he
could
do
it
just
as
well
as
then
the
instrument
was
duly
signed
and
witnessed
am
perfectly
sane
you
can
declare
you
martin
asked
the
miser
when
the
thing
was
done
want
any
mistake
to
be
made
about
need
have
no
fear
on
that
score
ready
tyler
announced
ann
making
her
appearance
at
this
point
right
you
boys
go
out
and
eat
it
said
the
old
man
doctor
wants
to
see
me
i
suppose
ann
can
bring
me
a
little
broth
in
here
afterwards
and
about
signing
that
sydney
i
want
to
add
a
clause
leaving
something
to
ann
i
forgot
about
silently
the
two
pells
went
out
into
the
dining
room
and
in
almost
silence
they
ate
the
broth
which
the
housekeeper
placed
before
them
then
when
she
had
gone
out
sydney
said
know
how
much
tyler
is
worth
roy
do
you
told
me
something
like
i
know
whether
to
believe
it
or
not
a
great
sum
of
money
sydney
i
feel
awfully
queer
about
the
whole
thing
does
it
seem
all
right
to
you
that
he
should
leave
it
all
to
mother
just
because
of
the
little
thing
i
did
for
him
this
afternoon
i
want
to
seem
to
feel
that
she
to
have
it
but
the
whole
thing
seems
so
nearly
so
queer
as
a
great
many
wills
that
are
made
every
day
rejoined
sydney
worry
over
it
roy
he
added
with
a
laugh
look
as
if
you
had
been
convicted
of
some
crime
remember
you
got
the
money
yet
and
may
not
have
it
for
a
great
many
years
to
my
money
syd
to
be
left
to
if
it
been
for
you
she
have
it
but
by
the
way
you
had
better
get
home
as
soon
as
you
can
i
think
mother
is
inclined
to
worry
about
you
from
what
jess
said
i
can
stay
with
the
old
man
as
long
as
it
is
i
say
anything
about
that
will
syd
rather
you
either
just
it
is
best
to
keep
it
as
quiet
as
we
can
it
seems
strange
that
the
old
man
should
have
talked
so
freely
about
it
as
he
the
meal
was
soon
finished
and
the
two
starting
to
enter
the
bedroom
met
the
doctor
in
the
doorway
in
a
bad
way
he
whispered
to
sydney
shall
come
back
again
this
evening
come
roy
are
you
going
down
take
you
along
with
me
in
the
better
go
roy
urged
sydney
look
worn
out
tell
mother
stay
here
as
long
as
tyler
said
roy
stepping
into
the
bedroom
and
extending
his
hand
to
the
old
man
roy
pell
you
have
made
me
think
better
of
my
kind
in
fact
i
think
you
have
made
a
changed
man
of
me
would
you
mind
coming
up
to
see
me
of
course
i
mind
come
i
hope
be
better
in
the
morning
and
roy
went
off
with
the
doctor
roy
said
the
latter
as
they
drove
away
are
to
be
congratulated
you
have
brought
your
family
into
a
nice
little
inheritance
if
all
our
miserly
old
friend
says
is
it
returned
roy
please
congratulate
me
or
say
anything
about
it
just
roy
was
so
tired
when
he
got
home
that
he
did
not
give
very
spirited
answers
to
the
questions
his
family
showered
upon
him
he
went
to
bed
very
shortly
and
was
asleep
before
rex
came
to
take
his
place
beside
him
all
in
the
household
were
locked
in
slumber
when
sydney
let
himself
in
with
his
key
about
eleven
he
did
not
retire
he
went
into
the
library
got
out
some
law
books
and
sitting
down
at
the
table
appeared
as
if
about
to
do
some
work
but
he
did
not
pick
up
the
pen
he
sat
there
his
head
sunk
on
his
chest
with
a
look
of
misery
on
his
face
that
was
pitiable
to
see
chapter
iv
the
twin
brothers
the
pells
breakfasted
early
so
that
sydney
might
catch
the
express
for
the
city
on
the
morning
following
the
events
narrated
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
entire
family
were
gathered
at
the
table
with
the
exception
of
rex
who
was
invariably
late
and
sydney
himself
very
strange
remarked
pell
is
always
on
time
he
can
barely
catch
his
train
now
i
wish
you
roy
would
run
up
to
his
room
and
see
what
is
the
matter
he
may
be
roy
soon
ascended
the
two
flights
of
stairs
to
the
apartment
with
the
dormer
window
that
had
always
been
the
door
was
open
and
the
room
was
empty
the
bed
had
been
slept
in
but
the
suit
syd
had
worn
the
day
before
was
not
about
he
had
evidently
dressed
and
gone
wonder
if
he
can
be
up
at
thought
roy
he
returned
to
the
dining
room
with
his
report
is
very
odd
remarked
pell
is
not
like
sydney
to
go
off
in
that
way
but
he
will
explain
when
he
comes
home
he
may
have
been
obliged
to
go
to
town
at
seven
on
business
for
so
what
did
the
old
gentleman
want
with
syd
asked
jessie
turning
to
roy
were
so
sleepy
when
you
came
home
last
night
that
you
half
satisfy
our
wanted
him
to
make
his
will
answered
roy
did
he
went
on
jess
i
say
mother
i
better
go
and
stir
up
rex
afraid
gone
off
to
sleep
coming
now
i
hear
his
step
on
the
stairs
so
you
just
sit
still
and
answer
my
questions
not
half
through
yet
and
jess
checked
off
on
her
fingers
the
two
queries
to
which
she
had
already
had
responses
then
is
he
as
rich
as
we
all
thought
him
good
afternoon
to
you
rex
better
late
than
never
going
to
keep
you
company
by
taking
a
second
cup
of
coffee
mother
may
i
please
pell
what
is
the
matter
with
you
exclaimed
jess
been
like
the
same
fellow
since
you
climbed
up
to
that
trestle
yesterday
afternoon
you
seem
to
be
trying
to
keep
something
back
you
notice
it
mother
have
put
in
rex
before
pell
could
speak
get
a
word
out
of
him
before
he
went
to
sleep
last
night
one
would
think
had
a
trouble
like
mine
to
bear
and
rex
sighed
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
roy
glanced
over
at
him
quickly
what
would
this
luxury
loving
brother
of
his
say
if
he
only
knew
but
roy
did
not
dare
tell
yet
tyler
might
live
for
years
and
have
ample
opportunity
to
change
his
mind
about
his
will
yes
it
was
better
to
keep
the
matter
to
himself
as
long
as
he
could
queer
about
me
he
said
now
giving
such
short
answers
to
our
questions
about
the
old
miser
returned
jess
promptly
a
rule
tell
us
all
we
wanted
to
know
without
our
having
to
draw
it
out
as
if
we
were
pulling
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
all
about
your
experience
over
at
the
people
up
in
the
town
will
hear
about
your
being
there
and
will
expect
us
to
know
all
the
details
it
is
quite
an
event
for
a
queer
old
character
like
the
burdock
miser
to
make
a
people
when
they
make
their
wills
usually
tell
everybody
in
the
house
what
they
put
into
them
a
sort
of
confidential
matter
you
understand
wager
you
know
all
about
it
roy
broke
in
rex
suddenly
dropping
the
biscuit
he
was
buttering
and
staring
at
his
brother
fixedly
for
a
moment
be
surprised
if
the
old
fellow
had
made
you
his
heir
for
what
you
did
for
if
he
did
answered
roy
with
a
smile
enable
you
to
take
that
trip
to
canada
as
he
dead
yet
and
may
live
to
be
just
the
kind
that
do
hang
on
remarked
jess
that
nobody
seems
to
care
about
generally
reminds
me
mother
added
rex
i
go
on
this
trip
be
a
lot
of
money
saved
i
have
some
of
it
spent
for
a
new
tennis

need

smiled
a
little
sadly
though
dear
boy
she
rejoined
is
your
patent
method
of
manufacturing
money
again
you
conceive
a
desire
for
something
very
expensive
then
when
you
give
that
up
and
select
something
much
cheaper
you
imagine
that
you
have
saved
more
than
enough
to
pay
for
a
thundering
grind
to
be
decently
poor
any
rex
pushed
back
his
chair
suddenly
his
brow
clouded
with
a
frown
as
it
had
been
the
afternoon
before
down
on
the
log
poor
what
do
you
mean
by
that
rex
asked
eva
to
have
the
taste
and
wish
for
nice
things
and
the
privilege
of
going
with
nice
people
who
own
them
and
yet
not
be
able
to
have
them
yourself
i
sometimes
wish
i
was
like
black
pete
he
know
any
better
than
to
be
contented
if
he
makes
a
dollar
or
two
a
reggie
reggie
murmured
pell
sadly
this
one
of
her
boys
caused
her
more
anxiety
than
all
the
other
children
combined
he
was
so
proud
so
aspiring
and
yet
he
had
not
half
the
ability
of
roy
who
was
rather
overshadowed
by
the
dashing
winning
manner
for
rex
could
be
charming
when
he
so
minded
he
went
out
on
the
side
piazza
now
and
began
to
shy
strawberries
at
two
of
the
puppies
the
berries
had
just
been
picked
and
left
by
the
cook
on
the
window
sill
for
the
girls
to
hull
exclaimed
roy
severely
coming
out
upon
him
suddenly
you
ashamed
to
use
those
berries
in
that
way
roy
hated
waste
above
all
things
rex
checked
the
toss
he
was
about
to
make
and
transferred
the
berry
to
his
mouth
instead
your
majesty
any
objections
to
that
disposition
of
the
fruit
he
asked
with
an
assumption
of
the
courtliness
that
became
him
so
well
a
legitimate
disposition
at
any
rate
returned
roy
then
he
went
out
to
the
barn
to
feed
the
chickens
and
look
after
the
cow
for
the
pells
kept
no
hired
man
the
boys
attended
to
the
kitchen
least
roy
did
most
of
it
and
there
had
been
no
horses
kept
by
the
family
since
shortly
after
death
this
was
another
of
trials
of
living
in
the
country
without
a
horse
he
would
exclaim
then
to
have
the
stable
on
the
place
into
the
bargain
enough
to
make
the
horse
we
got
to
be
sure
he
had
plenty
of
rides
the
bowmans
who
came
down
to
marley
for
the
summer
were
very
fond
of
him
and
nearly
every
day
during
the
summer
scott
took
him
out
in
his
cart
but
rex
sighed
to
return
this
hospitality
all
of
his
friends
were
glad
to
come
down
to
the
pellery
as
rex
called
it
for
pell
was
a
great
favorite
and
the
young
people
were
lively
and
bright
rex
fretted
however
because
he
had
no
to
offer
them
he
was
feeling
particularly
gloomy
this
morning
having
exhausted
himself
in
regretting
the
good
time
he
would
lose
in
not
being
able
to
go
with
the
bowmans
he
had
taken
to
lamenting
his
condition
here
in
marley
during
vacation
with
scott
away
he
was
not
so
fond
of
reading
as
was
roy
and
without
plenty
of
congenial
society
he
was
apt
to
find
that
time
hung
heavy
on
his
hands
scott
had
gone
to
philadelphia
this
morning
to
make
some
purchases
for
his
journey
he
would
not
be
back
till
afternoon
rex
had
not
yet
planned
what
to
do
with
himself
in
the
meantime
are
you
going
he
called
out
presently
when
he
saw
roy
walking
down
toward
the
gate
to
to
see
how
he
is
want
to
come
believe
i
do
answered
rex
slowly
on
a
minute
till
i
get
my
roy
was
rather
surprised
that
his
brother
should
wish
to
go
he
wondered
just
how
tyler
would
like
his
bringing
him
then
he
remembered
what
the
miser
had
said
about
rex
reminding
him
somewhat
of
maurice
darley
and
thought
perhaps
he
might
be
glad
to
see
him
on
this
account
it
was
cooler
than
it
had
been
the
previous
day
the
country
about
marley
and
burdock
was
beautiful
extremely
rolling
and
rich
in
vegetation
so
the
walk
was
a
pleasant
one
did
tyler
really
have
syd
make
his
will
last
night
asked
rex
as
they
were
crossing
the
covered
bridge
over
the
creek
answered
roy
he
have
much
to
leave
went
on
rex
stooping
down
as
they
emerged
on
the
road
again
to
pluck
a
tall
blade
of
grass
which
he
began
to
munch
between
his
white
teeth
half
a
roy
thought
he
might
as
well
tell
this
he
knew
that
if
he
tried
to
evade
the
question
his
brother
would
be
apt
to
think
he
was
keeping
something
back
rex
stopped
stock
still
in
the
road
to
utter
the
exclamation
old
bag
of
bones
worth
half
a
million
dollars
think
more
likely
he
should
be
worth
that
amount
returned
roy
the
bowmans
for
instance
who
seem
to
spend
their
income
right
up
to
the
handle
you
know
everybody
has
always
thought
tyler
had
know
they
have
but
such
a
sum
as
that
rex
walked
on
again
knitting
his
brows
in
thought
there
was
silence
between
the
boys
while
they
ascended
the
hill
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
then
as
they
reached
the
top
rex
was
about
to
ask
another
question
when
roy
clutched
his
arm
suddenly
there
he
cried
that
undertaker
wagon
in
front
of
the
house
tyler
must
be
dead
chapter
v
breaking
the
news
cæsar
roy
come
over
you
rex
was
staring
in
amazement
at
his
brother
who
had
turned
quite
white
at
the
sight
of
the
wagon
standing
in
front
of
the
home
he
had
halted
and
gone
off
to
one
side
of
the
road
to
lean
against
a
tree
where
he
stood
now
mopping
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
any
idea
he
would
die
so
soon
he
said
seems
like
an
awful
shock
although
i
do
remember
that
martin
said
he
was
in
a
pretty
bad
way
and
he
asked
me
to
come
and
see
him
i
mean
tyler
did
i
wonder
when
he
luck
for
his
heirs
remarked
rex
cried
roy
starting
forward
as
if
to
place
his
hand
over
his
mouth
know
what
i
suppose
it
was
a
little
rough
when
the
old
scarcely
cold
perhaps
i
say
you
going
on
we
can
find
out
just
when
he
died
you
mechanically
roy
followed
his
brother
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
that
black
wagon
he
could
not
realize
it
yet
tyler
dead
so
soon
after
making
that
will
which
left
pell
all
his
money
no
more
poverty
for
them
the
stable
need
no
longer
be
empty
roy
checked
these
thoughts
with
a
half
suppressed
exclamation
of
disgust
it
seemed
sacrilegious
to
be
speculating
in
this
fashion
on
the
gain
from
the
death
of
the
old
man
who
had
been
so
fond
of
life
for
all
he
had
made
such
poor
use
of
it
they
were
now
close
enough
to
the
cottage
to
see
that
the
carriage
stood
there
just
behind
the
ominous
vehicle
belonging
to
green
the
doctor
himself
was
coming
out
of
the
house
seeing
the
boys
he
halted
till
they
came
up
with
him
doctor
when
did
it
happen
asked
roy
night
about
ten
was
the
answer
sydney
tell
you
i
seen
syd
since
i
left
him
here
yesterday
is
he
here
now
he
is
very
busy
in
town
seeing
about
the
arrangements
there
you
know
he
is
one
of
the
executors
things
take
queer
turns
in
this
world
of
ours
they
you
little
thought
at
this
time
yesterday
morning
that
before
hours
had
passed
you
would
be
the
means
of
bringing
a
great
fortune
into
the
family
but
i
must
hurry
off
to
do
what
i
can
for
the
living
is
nothing
that
i
can
do
for
him
is
there
roy
stepped
apart
from
his
brother
and
closer
to
the
doctor
to
ask
the
question
my
boy
was
the
answer
now
you
have
obeyed
his
last
request
of
you
it
is
not
your
fault
that
you
are
too
the
physician
drove
off
leaving
the
two
boys
standing
in
the
road
in
front
of
the
silent
cottage
for
the
undertaker
was
carrying
on
his
work
noiselessly
said
rex
suddenly
placing
a
hand
on
each
of
his
shoulders
and
looking
him
squarely
in
the
face
did
martin
mean
by
what
he
said
just
now
about
your
being
the
means
of
bringing
a
fortune
into
the
family
ask
anything
about
it
just
here
come
hurry
off
toward
home
tell
you
on
the
roy
slipped
his
arm
through
his
and
led
him
off
down
the
hill
then
said
rex
impatiently
when
they
had
reached
the
marley
turnpike
again
must
tell
me
did
tyler
leave
you
any
money
for
what
you
did
for
him
yesterday
replied
roy
in
a
kind
of
burst
he
left
his
whole
fortune
to
rex
did
not
stop
and
throw
up
his
hands
as
roy
had
half
expected
he
would
do
he
came
closer
to
his
brother
and
suddenly
passed
one
arm
about
his
neck
as
they
walked
on
together
and
drew
him
close
to
him
roy
he
said
owe
all
this
to
then
he
walked
off
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
dropped
down
on
the
grass
roy
came
over
to
take
his
place
beside
him
want
to
say
anything
about
it
before
he
explained
might
have
been
years
before
we
came
into
the
money
and
now
it
may
not
be
nearly
so
much
as
i
said
we
only
have
old
word
for
it
but
both
syd
and
martin
seemed
to
think
he
was
telling
the
mother
know
asked
rex
in
a
low
voice
he
seemed
to
be
quite
changed
since
he
had
heard
the
wonderful
news
his
manner
had
become
quiet
subdued
more
like
nobody
knows
but
you
and
syd
and
you
will
tell
mother
as
soon
as
you
get
back
i
suppose
i
had
realize
it
yet
roy
half
a
million
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
now
we
live
on
an
income
of
about
two
thousand
rex
brought
his
eyes
down
from
the
sky
where
he
had
been
allowing
them
to
soar
and
fixed
them
on
his
last
tan
shoes
they
were
whole
yet
but
had
lost
their
freshness
he
could
have
new
ones
now
he
reflected
without
waiting
for
these
old
ones
to
wear
out
did
he
come
to
do
it
roy
he
went
on
he
any
relatives
or
anybody
of
his
own
know
syd
can
tell
you
more
about
it
than
i
can
come
we
had
better
be
getting
the
boys
rose
and
resumed
their
walk
presently
rex
remarked
shall
we
get
hold
of
the
money
do
you
suppose
roy
know
talk
about
it
in
that
way
it
seems
roy
one
would
think
you
wished
we
got
it
what
makes
you
act
so
queer
about
the
thing
the
thing
itself
seems
queer
i
are
not
sorry
about
it
are
you
you
almost
act
no
not
sorry
but
i
seem
to
realize
it
i
can
now
had
a
little
chance
to
get
used
to
it
i
can
realize
that
it
means
a
new
tennis
suit
for
me
unlimited
pairs
of
shoes
horses
and
carriages
and
perhaps
my
trip
to
canada
with
the
go
on
in
that
strain
with
the
man
still
unburied
if
you
only
knew
how
it
reginald
looked
a
little
abashed
and
as
they
reached
a
fork
in
the
road
just
then
announced
that
he
was
going
up
in
the
town
to
see
his
friend
charlie
minturn
tell
him
about
this
roy
begged
do
you
take
me
for
returned
rex
in
his
most
dignified
manner
he
strode
on
up
the
hill
his
head
thrown
back
his
chin
the
least
bit
elevated
in
the
air
afraid
for
reggie
murmured
roy
as
he
kept
on
toward
the
pellery
suit
him
at
all
but
it
seems
to
me
riches
are
going
to
suit
him
too
the
girls
were
hulling
the
strawberries
on
the
side
porch
when
he
reached
the
house
mother
he
asked
as
he
came
up
and
sat
down
at
their
feet
to
market
replied
eva
have
you
and
rex
been
inquired
jess
saw
you
crossing
the
bridge
together
i
thought
the
crawfords
were
away
nobody
else
be
likely
to
go
and
see
over
in
tyler
replied
roy
asked
me
to
go
up
and
see
him
but
i
was
too
late
oh
roy
both
girls
uttered
the
exclamation
death
almost
always
horrifies
they
had
roy
tell
them
in
detail
all
about
the
talk
he
had
had
with
the
miser
the
previous
afternoon
but
he
said
nothing
about
the
will
he
thought
his
mother
ought
to
know
first
come
mother
and
rex
now
exclaimed
jess
presently
suppose
told
her
thought
roy
this
was
the
case
there
was
a
flush
in
cheeks
as
she
came
up
and
rex
exclaimed
as
soon
as
he
was
within
speaking
distance
knows
have
you
told
the
girls
yet
roy
a
look
of
annoyance
crossed
face
but
before
either
she
or
roy
could
say
anything
jess
sprang
to
her
feet
nearly
upsetting
the
bowl
of
strawberries
in
the
act
you
what
been
an
air
of
mystery
about
you
ever
since
you
left
the
creek
yesterday
course
there
has
exclaimed
rex
exuberantly
something
worth
being
mysterious
about
eh
brub
what
should
you
say
sisters
mine
if
i
should
tell
you
that
the
magic
wand
of
fortune
has
been
waved
over
the
pellery
which
will
transform
yonder
sober
fowls
into
gallant
steeds
these
homely
pups
into
expensive
hounds
of
the
hunt
rex
always
knew
he
had
gone
too
far
when
his
mother
spoke
like
that
he
ceased
abruptly
and
dashed
into
the
house
as
if
to
cut
himself
off
from
temptation
to
transgress
further
the
next
moment
they
heard
him
whistling
a
comic
opera
air
up
in
his
room
you
tell
me
what
all
this
means
you
this
from
jess
in
almost
a
desperate
tone
you
may
as
well
all
know
now
said
pell
sinking
into
a
chair
find
that
half
of
the
town
seems
to
be
aware
of
it
it
quick
mother
it
something
awful
is
it
not
awful
for
us
my
dears
it
is
just
this
your
brother
roy
touched
old
heart
by
what
he
did
for
him
yesterday
and
in
the
will
he
made
last
night
he
left
all
his
fortune
about
half
a
million
to
both
girls
sat
there
as
if
stricken
dumb
staring
at
their
mother
as
she
told
them
the
wonderful
news
chapter
vi
rex
goes
to
town
very
sorry
indeed
this
came
out
now
it
seems
unfeeling
to
talk
about
it
while
that
poor
old
body
is
above
ground
and
then
the
amount
of
the
fortune
he
possessed
may
be
grossly
this
was
summary
of
the
matter
delivered
several
times
during
that
afternoon
the
girls
took
the
thing
very
quietly
am
so
glad
on
account
eva
said
though
more
than
once
has
always
worked
so
hard
for
jess
seemed
dazed
by
the
possibility
of
the
new
order
of
things
while
roy
was
disinclined
to
talk
about
it
at
all
rex
however
made
up
for
the
apparent
apathy
of
the
others
at
lunch
he
wanted
to
know
when
they
were
going
to
move
course
we
want
to
go
on
staying
in
a
bandbox
of
a
place
like
this
when
mother
is
a
millionaire
he
said
half
a
one
jess
corrected
him
with
a
smile
no
matter
about
that

figuring
up
on
the
income
that

could
get

touching
the
principal

i
make
it
a
reggie
reggie

am
afraid

incorrigible
groaned
his
mother

of
the

in
doing
a
little
calculating
here
in
the
privacy
of
our
home

up
and
proclaim
it
from
the
you
may
be
reckoning
without
your

my
dear

interposed
jess
if

only
a
thousand

bank
instead
of
five
hundred
thousand
we
know
anything
certain
till
syd
comes
home
added
roy
wait
for
that
muttered
rex
under
his
breath
he
subsided
for
the
rest
of
his
meal
however
but
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
went
up
to
his
room
and
proceeded
to
go
through
all
the
pockets
of
his
different
suits
by
a
quarter
he
murmured
as
he
finally
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
jingled
the
small
change
he
had
collected
have
to
go
to
mother
after
he
glanced
up
at
a
stuck
in
the
mirror
hurriedly
changed
his
knockabout
suit
for
his
best
one
and
then
rushed
down
to
the
dining
room
where
pell
was
helping
eva
shell
peas
for
dinner
he
went
straight
up
to
her
and
put
his
arm
affectionately
about
her
neck
he
said
in
his
winning
way
want
to
run
up
to
the
city
for
this
afternoon
a
quarter
short
to
buy
my
ticket

please

in
uncertainty
i

see

sure
about

besides
it
will
keep
me
from
shocking
you
here
if
i
sydney
is
sure
to
be
very
busy
you
will
bother
him
by
going
to
the
i
he
never
lets
me
bother
him
besides
i
only
want
to
see
him
for
a
minute
you
know
i
been
in
town
since
school
closed
the
train
goes
in
twenty
minutes
and
come
back
with
syd
please
right
rex
you

go
but
remember
i
trust
you
not

annoy
sydney
you
will
find
my
purse
in
my
top
bureau
drawer
left
hand
are
the
best
mother
a
boy
ever
with
a
hasty
kiss
rex
was
off
secured
his
quarter
and
then
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
toward
the
family
struck
out
across
the
pasture
for
the
path
that
led
up
over
the
hill
in
a
short
cut
to
the
station
there
was
nobody
so
easy
to
get
along
with
as
long
as
you
allowed
him
to
have
his
own
way
is
a
crazy
notion
of
his
wanting
to
go
in
to
town
just
because
he
wait
till
syd
comes
out
remarked
roy
when
he
heard
of
it
at
the
same
time
he
felt
a
sensation
of
relief
to
think
that
his
impulsive
brother
was
out
of
marley
and
away
from
the
temptation
to
disquiet
the
family
by
telling
his
fellow
townsmen
what
he
meant
to
do
with
their
money
when
they
came
into
it
rex
meanwhile
was
enjoying
himself
hugely
he
saw
nobody
he
knew
at
this
unusual
hour
of
going
to
town
but
he
lay
back
in
his
seat
while
the
breeze
created
by
the
swift
motion
of
the
cars
rushed
refreshingly
past
him
and
built
air
castles
of
the
most
luxurious
description
must
be
so
he
told
himself
whenever
the
doubts
suggested
by
jess
arose
in
his
mind
to
trouble
him
martin
congratulated
roy
everybody
has
known
that
tyler
had
lots
of
money
when
the
train
reached
philadelphia
rex
hurried
off
to
the
law
office
where
syd
had
his
desk
it
was
some
distance
from
the
station
but
having
spent
all
his
money
for
his
excursion
ticket
he
had
none
left
for
car
fare
will
be
the
last
time
be
so
short
he
mused
a
smile
which
he
could
not
repress
playing
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
buoyed
up
by
this
reflection
he
did
not
so
much
mind
the
distance
nor
the
heat
which
he
found
much
more
oppressive
here
in
the
city
than
it
was
in
marley
he
reached
place
at
last
only
to
find
that
his
brother
was
out
and
that
the
boy
was
not
just
sure
when
he
would
be
back
be
here
before
he
goes
to
the
train
he
asked
rex
yes
sure
was
the
reply
satchel
is
here
with
the
books
he
always
come
back
again
rex
went
out
thinking
that
now
there
was
no
danger
of
his
ever
having
to
step
into
the
shoes
of
this
office
boy
syd
had
remarked
once
or
twice
that
he
thought
he
could
get
him
a
position
in
a
law
office
when
he
was
through
school
rex
wandered
along
the
street
aimlessly
for
a
while
if
it
been
midsummer
he
might
have
gone
over
to
spruce
and
walnut
and
called
on
some
of
his
friends
but
they
were
either
at
their
summer
homes
in
marley
or
off
traveling
he
was
therefore
reduced
to
walking
to
kill
time
choosing
the
shady
side
and
watching
for
any
incident
of
city
life
that
might
divert
his
mind
he
came
to
a
bicycle
emporium
presently
and
stood
for
some
time
in
front
of
it
trying
to
decide
which
wheel
he
should
select
when
he
came
to
purchase
as
he
hoped
to
do
very
shortly
now
the
dandy
kind
remarked
a
voice
over
his
shoulder
wizard
motor
you
can
ride
over
all
sorts
of
roads
with
rex
turned
and
saw
a
fellow
about
a
year
older
than
himself
he
had
a
red
face
and
wore
an
outing
shirt
that
was
not
as
fresh
as
it
might
have
been
rex
who
was
rather
fastidious
as
to
his
friends
simply
said
and
moved
on
the
fellow
noticed
the
look
which
accompanied
the
word
dude
he
muttered
too
good
to
talk
with
the
likes
me
get
even
with
he
waited
an
instant
and
then
followed
rex
at
a
distance
presently
something
that
he
espied
ahead
caused
him
to
scan
the
sidewalk
and
the
street
next
it
closely
then
he
stepped
out
into
the
roadway
and
picked
up
a
piece
of
coal
that
had
dropped
from
a
passing
cart
he
quickened
his
steps
and
nearly
caught
up
with
rex
just
as
the
latter
was
passing
a
chinese
laundry
for
your
life
runaway
team
behind
you
he
exclaimed
suddenly
darting
forward
and
calling
out
the
words
almost
in
ear
at
the
same
instant
he
flung
the
piece
of
coal
he
had
picked
up
straight
into
the
window
of
the
chinese
laundry
there
was
a
crash
of
glass
and
rex
connecting
the
sound
with
the
warning
he
had
received
immediately
took
to
his
heels
he
goes
called
out
the
red
faced
youth
to
the
chinaman
who
promptly
appeared
in
the
door
of
his
shop
the
almond
eyes
caught
sight
of
fleeing
figure
it
was
enough
he
dropped
his
iron
and
rushed
after
rex
the
conscienceless
hoodlum
joining
in
the
chase
rex
hearing
no
further
sound
to
tell
him
that
a
dangerous
runaway
was
close
upon
him
had
just
decided
to
slacken
his
pace
and
turn
around
to
investigate
when
he
felt
a
hand
laid
on
his
shoulder
got
you
crowed
a
wheezy
voice
in
his
ear
for
pleecy
rex
was
horrified
to
find
himself
in
the
grasp
of
a
chinese
laundryman
go
of
me
what
do
you
want
he
cried
struggling
to
get
free
breakee
glass
you
go
to
jailee
here
pleecyman
true
enough
among
the
crowd
that
had
hastily
collected
was
a
officer
him
let
me
go
exclaimed
rex
appealing
to
the
representative
of
the
law
do
anything
to
he
did
called
out
a
bystander
whose
sympathies
had
been
awakened
for
the
much
suffering
heathen
saw
him
running
for
all
he
was
worth
pretty
strong
evidence
it
the
policeman
appeared
to
think
so
for
he
came
up
and
caught
rex
by
the
arm
chapter
vii
humiliation
rex
never
felt
so
humiliated
in
his
life
here
he
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
captured
by
a
policeman
and
accused
by
a
miserable
chinaman
of
breaking
a
pane
of
glass
all
a
mistake
i
tell
you
he
cried
starting
to
wrest
himself
loose
from
the
grasp
and
then
suddenly
remaining
passive
as
he
reflected
that
this
was
undignified
did
you
run
for
then
questioned
the
policeman
he
told
me
fellow
with
the
red
face
and
rex
looked
around
in
the
throng
to
pick
out
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
but
that
individual
had
discreetly
disappeared
see
him
now
he
went
on
guess
you
put
in
the
bystander
who
had
already
spoken
you
run
every
time
anybody
tells
you
to
said
there
was
a
runaway
team
behind
me
then
i
heard
the
glass
break
he
must
have
thrown
the
stone
rex
tried
to
speak
calmly
but
he
was
boiling
over
with
rage
at
the
trick
which
he
now
realized
had
been
played
upon
him
wantee
new
glass
the
chinaman
insisted
how
fervently
rex
wished
at
that
moment
that
they
had
come
into
their
inheritance
he
would
have
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
drawn
out
a
five
dollar
bill
with
a
lordly
air
and
handed
it
over
with
the
words
this
i
break
the
glass
but
i
pity
the
poor
as
it
was
he
had
not
a
penny
about
him
it
was
difficult
to
keep
up
an
air
of
bravado
under
these
circumstances
the
crowd
was
growing
bigger
each
minute
the
policeman
looked
somewhat
perplexed
he
judged
from
appearance
that
he
was
not
a
hoodlum
who
would
be
likely
to
throw
a
stone
at
a
window
but
he
admitted
that
he
had
been
running
and
here
was
a
man
ready
to
swear
that
he
saw
him
throw
the
stone
is
your
name
he
asked
bemis
pell
replied
rex
promptly
he
was
proud
of
his
name
and
brought
it
out
now
with
a
kind
of
flourish
do
you
live
went
on
the
officer
while
the
crowd
pressed
closer
to
hear
the
replies
look
like
a
boy
who
would
break
windows
for
the
fun
of
course
i
and
when
my
brother
hears
of
this
outrage
raise
a
big
fuss
over
it
a
lawyer
and
knows
how
to
do
rex
feel
a
bit
humorous
when
he
made
this
assertion
but
there
was
something
in
it
that
struck
the
crowd
as
very
funny
a
good
many
laughed
and
the
policeman
tried
to
repress
a
smile
is
this
brother
of
yours
here
in
the
city
and
rex
gave
the
address
not
far
said
the
officer
go
round
there
and
see
if
you
have
told
us
a
straight
story
come
along
john
he
added
to
the
laundryman
rex
glowed
with
a
sense
of
triumph
for
a
minute
and
then
began
to
reflect
on
what
syd
would
say
at
seeing
him
appear
in
such
a
police
officer
and
a
chinaman
and
there
was
the
crowd
that
strung
on
behind
as
the
three
moved
off
wish
stayed
at
home
groaned
poor
rex
to
himself
however
he
tried
to
take
some
comfort
from
the
fact
that
the
arm
was
not
on
his
shoulder
people
they
passed
might
think
it
was
the
chinaman
who
was
under
arrest
then
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
be
glad
that
it
was
midsummer
with
no
chance
of
his
meeting
any
of
his
friends
he
was
trying
to
decide
what
he
should
do
in
case
syd
had
not
come
back
by
the
time
they
reached
the
office
when
just
as
they
turned
into
chestnut
street
a
familiar
voice
cried
out
rex
what
under
the
sun
it
was
scott
bowman
he
had
just
come
out
of
a
trunk
store
in
time
to
confront
the
sorry
procession
rex
wished
the
manhole
cover
over
which
he
was
passing
would
suddenly
give
way
and
precipitate
him
under
the
sidewalk
in
theatrical
trap
door
fashion
scott
was
the
last
person
in
all
the
world
whom
he
wished
to
see
you
come
near
me
scott
he
answered
you
want
to
be
disgraced
under
the
look
of
utter
and
complete
amazement
on
young
face
at
hearing
this
did
more
to
convince
the
officer
he
had
the
wrong
person
in
custody
than
anything
else
he
allowed
rex
to
stop
and
parley
with
his
friend
the
situation
was
explained
in
few
words
scott
was
a
year
older
than
rex
his
father
was
a
city
official
with
a
salary
of
ten
thousand
a
year
he
was
highly
indignant
when
he
heard
of
the
outrage
is
monstrous
he
said
and
announcing
who
he
was
demanded
that
rex
be
instantly
released
i
do
that
mr
bowman
if
that
is
really
your
name
responded
the
officer
somewhat
nettled
this
young
gentleman
happens
to
be
a
friend
of
yours
it
make
it
any
the
less
likely
that
he
broke
that
that
is
really
my
name
repeated
scott
highly
incensed
find
out
whether
that
is
my
name
or
not
when
i
report
this
affair
to
my
the
officer
smiled
so
did
a
number
in
the
crowd
rex
felt
that
his
former
humiliation
was
nothing
compared
to
that
which
he
was
now
undergoing
having
caused
his
friend
to
be
treated
in
this
insulting
fashion
on
said
the
policeman
and
the
line
of
march
to
office
was
resumed
scott
valiantly
falling
into
place
beside
rex
vowing
vengeance
on
the
entire
force
of
bluecoats
stay
with
me
scott
rex
implored
him
borne
enough
i
want
to
drag
you
down
into
the
mire
you
suppose
desert
a
friend
in
a
time
of
need
like
this
returned
scott
going
to
take
this
number
now
while
i
think
of
scott
fished
a
pencil
out
of
one
pocket
and
a
railroad
timetable
out
of
the
other
and
glancing
at
the
shield
on
the
breast
of
the
policeman
made
a
record
of
the
figures
on
it
in
a
very
conspicuous
manner
but
the
officer
did
not
tremble
with
apprehension
he
simply
turned
to
rex
and
observed
is
the
place
it
they
had
reached
the
building
in
which
sydney
had
his
office
this
is
the
place
replied
rex
slowly
he
was
thinking
how
dreadful
it
would
be
to
present
himself
before
syd
with
this
crowd
at
his
heels
know
whether
in
or
not
he
added
you
mind
going
up
and
finding
out
scott
course
i
i
know
just
where
the
room
is
and
bring
him
down
in
a
the
policeman
motioned
the
crowd
back
and
he
and
rex
and
the
patient
chinaman
went
into
the
marble
corridor
and
waited
while
the
throng
peered
in
at
them
from
the
doorway
and
a
new
one
began
to
gather
from
among
those
who
passed
to
and
fro
in
the
building
glad
i
never
knew
this
was
going
to
happen
to
me
reflected
rex
never
have
known
a
happy
day
if
i
he
had
no
fear
of
going
to
jail
he
felt
that
there
was
justice
enough
in
the
world
to
ward
that
off
but
the
ignominy
of
his
present
position
was
torture
enough
to
a
proud
spirit
like
his
ah
here
was
one
of
the
elevators
coming
down
with
scott
looking
eagerly
out
at
him
and
syd
was
with
him
but
was
it
syd
this
fellow
with
the
pallid
cheeks
and
deep
circles
under
the
eyes
yes
it
certainly
was
his
brother
for
he
stepped
out
ahead
of
scott
and
came
over
at
once
to
pass
his
arm
about
rex
in
gesture
of
protection
reginald
gave
an
almost
unconscious
sigh
of
relief
within
that
embrace
he
felt
that
he
was
safe
what
is
all
this
about
said
sydney
in
his
tone
addressing
the
officer
seems
you
have
arrested
my
brother
here
for
breaking
a
windows
did
you
see
him
throw
the
stone
but
a
gentleman
did
replied
the
officer
that
gentleman
now
he
was
not
to
be
found
he
had
dropped
out
of
the
procession
before
it
reached
chestnut
street
was
a
bystander
he
is
not
here

answered
the
policeman
think
the
boy
did
it
myself
but
he
admits
that
he
was
running
when
the
alarm
was
amounts
to
nothing
do
you
arrest
everybody
that
runs

the
street

why
you
were
running
rex

so
as
he
had
already
done

who
told
you
that
there
was
a
runaway

for
you

on
sydney

before
he
came
up
and
spoke
to
me
while
i
was
looking
in
a
store
window
at
some
you
answer
him
rex
hesitated
a
moment
i
exactly
like
his
looks
so
i
said
or
i
forget
which
now
and
went
seems
like
a
clear
case
of
the
wrong
man
officer
summed
up
sydney
was
that
hoodlum
who
broke
the
glass
just
for
the
sake
of
getting
my
brother
into
trouble
you
ought
to
see
that
plainly
enough
you
do

all
the
story
before

beg
the
young
pardon
come
john

to
look
elsewhere

your
tormentor

the
officer

the
arm
and
walked
out
with
him
chapter
viii
in
office
awfully
sorry
syd
began
rex
as
soon
as
the
three
were
left
alone
and
had
stepped
into
the
elevator
never
felt
so
disgraced
in
my
did
nothing
wrong
replied
syd
pressing
his
hand
against
his
forehead
for
an
instant
as
if
it
pained
him
what
are
you
doing
in
town
came
to
see
you
answered
rex
and
then
looked
at
scott
who
had
said
that
as
it
was
so
near
train
time
he
would
wait
and
go
to
the
station
with
the
pells
you
are
ill
he
went
on
the
next
instant
his
eyes
coming
back
to
the
face
is
the
matter
syd
all
right
responded
the
young
lawyer
he
forced
a
smile
to
his
lips
and
turning
to
scott
asked
when
the
bowmans
expected
to
start
on
their
trip
was
the
reply
too
bad
rex
come
with
us
i
was
counting
on
him
have
no
end
of
syd
suddenly
broke
in
rex
you
know
that
old
tyler
was
dead
or
did
he
die
before
you
came
home
last
night
a
sort
of
spasm
passed
over
face
but
they
were
just
stepping
out
of
the
elevator
and
neither
of
the
boys
noticed
it
he
died
before
i
left
he
answered
as
they
entered
his
rooms
which
he
shared
with
a
fellow
member
of
the
bar
who
was
now
away
got
some
last
things
to
attend
to
before
i
leave
you
fellows
make
yourselves
comfortable
in
there
and
be
ready
in
five
he
pointed
to
the
adjoining
room
where
rex
and
scott
at
once
established
themselves
in
the
window
and
looked
down
on
the
busy
street
far
below
them
know
tyler
was
dead
began
scott
heard
what
roy
did
for
him
on
the
bridge
though
by
george
that
was
plucky
but
by
the
way
the
matter
with
your
brother
sydney
he
looks
terribly
you
notice
it
course
i
did
and
spoke
about
it
working
too
hard
i
guess
i
say
scott
you
tell
anybody
about
my
adventure
this
afternoon
course
i
only
father
to
report
how
insulting
that
policeman
let
that
go
i
like
even
your
father
to
hear
it
i
feel
humiliated
enough
that
you
should
know
about
it
say
scott
rex
paused
suddenly
the
recollection
of
his
recent
experience
stung
him
whenever
it
came
up
in
his
mind
he
felt
that
scott
must
be
constantly
thinking
of
it
too
he
wanted
to
tell
him
something
that
would
banish
it
from
his
thoughts
my
boy
what
is
it
rejoined
scott
i
tell
you
something
will
you
promise
to
keep
it
a
secret
everybody
knows
it
as
they
will
probably
in
a
day
or
two
course
i
will
it
must
be
something
mighty
important
from
your
mysterious
air
old
is
awfully
eyes
were
fixed
on
trowsers
he
saw
that
they
were
a
new
pair
evidently
purchased
to
be
worn
on
the
trip
what
a
thing
it
was
to
have
money
so
that
you
could
get
extra
things
whenever
you
wanted
them
and
not
be
obliged
to
wait
till
you
could
afford
it
and
the
pells
would
even
be
richer
than
the
bowmans
rex
paused
so
long
while
he
was
thinking
over
all
this
that
scott
broke
in
with
what
is
it
keep
me
on
the
rack
so
i
tell
you
went
on
rex
some
people
know
it
in
marley
already
and
you
are
my
best
friend
you
know
old
man
tyler
left
his
money
to
mother
and
something
like
half
a
million
pell
scott
brought
out
these
words
with
strong
emphasis
then
seized
his
hand
and
wrung
it
heartily
said
rex
seeing
that
syd
was
coming
toward
them
seems
awful
to
be
congratulated
now
when
the
old
man
buried
yet
that
saying
sydney
had
hastened
forward
and
laid
his
hand
on
shoulder
rex
colored
syd
looked
so
very
serious
and
now
as
he
stood
there
in
the
full
glare
of
daylight
the
signs
of
suffering
on
his
face
were
plainly
apparent
you
are
ill
exclaimed
rex
forgetting
about
what
he
had
been
saying
ought
to
be
at
home
at
mind
about
me
reggie
tell
me
what
you
were
just
telling
think
it
was
any
harm
a
good
many
people
in
marley
know
it
now
i
was
telling
him
about
it
eyes
were
looking
steadily
unsmilingly
down
into
his
as
he
put
the
question
rex
was
really
frightened
now
he
had
never
seen
sydney
look
just
like
this
before
told
him
about
leaving
his
money
to
us
on
account
of
what
roy
had
done
he
faltered
eyes
closed
he
started
to
reel
backwards
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
scott
sprung
forward
and
caught
him
me
ease
him
down
in
the
chair
rex
he
called
out
scarcely
knowing
what
he
was
doing
reginald
took
hold
of
his
other
arm
and
between
them
the
two
boys
got
him
down
gently
into
a
chair
that
stood
near
the
window
dead
is
he
voice
was
hardly
more
than
a
whisper
as
he
put
the
awful
question
sydney
certainly
looked
almost
like
a
corpse
with
his
pallid
face
and
his
head
hanging
itself
lifelessly
over
on
one
side
it
was
a
trying
situation
for
the
two
boys
neither
of
them
had
had
the
slightest
experience
with
cases
of
this
sort
it
was
so
late
in
the
afternoon
that
the
offices
around
them
were
all
empty
he
is
not
dead
sure
of
that
scott
replied
who
as
the
senior
of
rex
by
some
eleven
months
felt
that
it
was
natural
for
the
other
to
seem
to
rely
upon
him
ought
to
have
a
doctor
at
once
we
leave
him
that
way
while
i
go
for
one
besides
i
know
where
to
do
i
our
doctor
is
clear
at
the
other
end
of
town
and
besides
down
at
atlantic
city
by
this
time
awful
it
oh
what
shall
we
do
scott
might
ring
for
an
ambulance
the
quickest
we
want
to
have
him
taken
to
the
hospital
come
help
me
get
him
out
of
that
chair
horrible
to
see
his
head
hang
over
like
where
can
we
put
him
no
lounge
about
is
there
but
we
might
let
him
lie
on
the
floor
on
that
rug
yonder
see
we
can
take
this
cushion
out
of
this
chair
for
a
with
much
difficulty
for
they
felt
that
they
must
go
about
the
work
of
transfer
with
the
greatest
care
the
unconscious
man
was
removed
and
placed
in
what
both
boys
considered
would
be
an
easier
position
for
him
but
when
he
was
stretched
out
at
their
feet
the
spectacle
was
such
an
ominous
one
that
rex
almost
wished
that
they
had
left
him
where
he
was
you
think
we
ought
to
throw
water
in
his
face
or
fan
him
or
something
he
asked
helplessly
know
what
we
ought
to
do
rex
except
i
think
we
ought
to
have
a
doctor
the
first
thing
i
tell
you
you
stay
here
with
him
and
go
down
and
find
a
drug
store
know
where
i
can
get
a
doctor
right
be
as
quick
as
you
scott
was
off
on
the
instant
and
rex
was
left
alone
with
the
unconscious
sydney
his
mind
was
filled
with
a
multitude
of
thoughts
in
regard
to
the
strange
seizure
was
he
reginald
responsible
for
it
what
if
he
had
not
come
to
philadelphia
would
it
have
happened
he
tried
to
console
himself
with
the
reflection
that
the
thing
was
bound
to
occur
any
way
and
that
it
was
providential
that
he
and
scott
were
present
to
give
aid
then
he
remembered
how
the
attack
had
come
on
at
the
very
moment
when
sydney
learned
that
he
rex
had
told
of
their
inheritance
from
the
miser
and
he
felt
more
dismal
than
ever
it
was
very
quiet
in
that
great
office
building
at
this
time
of
the
day
the
noise
of
the
car
bells
and
traffic
that
came
in
through
the
open
windows
from
the
street
far
below
only
made
the
stillness
within
more
marked
the
office
boy
had
taken
the
mail
and
gone
home
just
before
rex
and
scott
arrived
rex
glanced
up
at
the
clock
they
would
not
be
able
to
catch
the
express
now
how
good
scott
was
to
stay
with
him
he
would
pay
him
back
for
it
all
when
they
came
into
their
fortune
but
he
seemed
to
be
a
long
while
gone
rex
left
his
position
by
sydney
and
went
to
the
window
by
leaning
very
far
out
he
could
just
see
over
the
heavy
stone
still
to
the
street
below
but
it
was
quite
impossible
to
recognize
any
one
at
that
distance
he
wriggled
back
till
his
feet
touched
the
floor
again
and
then
returned
to
take
up
his
watch
by
sydney
once
more
he
wished
that
roy
was
with
him
though
they
were
twins
he
felt
that
his
brother
possessed
twice
the
self
reliance
in
emergencies
that
he
did
wonder
if
i
ought
to
telegraph
to
mother
was
his
next
thought
then
he
heard
the
door
of
the
elevator
slide
back
and
the
next
instant
scott
bowman
appeared
accompanied
by
a
short
man
with
side
whiskers
and
spectacles
chapter
ix
the
mystery
about
sydney
the
boys
stood
by
in
anxious
suspense
while
the
doctor
made
his
examination
is
utter
collapse
from
severe
mental
strain
he
said
after
a
minute
will
come
around
he
wrote
out
a
prescription
and
gave
it
to
scott
to
take
out
for
him
and
then
turned
to
rex
are
brother
i
believe
he
said
answered
rex
for
the
fact
that
there
was
no
blood
relation
between
them
was
one
that
very
seldom
recurred
to
the
minds
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
assign
some
cause
for
this
seizure
was
pell
excited
by
anything
in
particular
when
it
took
him
rex
hesitated
remembering
how
sydney
had
been
affected
by
learning
that
he
had
revealed
the
facts
about
will
to
scott
he
felt
that
he
ought
not
to
speak
of
the
matter
to
any
one
else
he
was
excited
by
family
affair
he
replied
hoping
this
was
all
he
need
say
on
the
matter
muttered
the
physician
and
he
not
only
took
another
critical
look
at
face
but
favored
rex
with
a
long
stare
too
he
be
well
enough
to
go
down
to
marley
asked
the
latter
live
out
of
town
then
returned
the
doctor
no
place
where
you
could
take
him
here
in
the
city
but
a
hotel
rejoined
rex
sure
my
mother
would
rather
have
him
at
this
point
sydney
stirred
and
opened
his
eyes
he
looked
first
at
the
doctor
frowned
deeply
and
then
as
rex
came
forward
within
his
range
of
vision
he
beckoned
the
boy
to
him
rex
hurried
over
and
knelt
by
his
side
is
that
asked
sydney
a
doctor
you
fainted
or
something
and
scott
went
out
to
get
him
how
do
you
feel
weak
but
ask
him
to
step
into
the
next
room
a
minute
i
want
to
speak
to
will
you
mind
waiting
in
the
next
room
a
minute
my
brother
wants
to
see
me
about
rex
was
afraid
the
physician
might
feel
offended
or
else
object
to
leaving
his
patient
but
he
said
certainly
and
then
came
over
to
take
a
close
look
at
the
young
lawyer
before
leaving
him
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
sydney
put
out
one
arm
and
passing
it
around
neck
drew
the
ear
close
to
his
mouth
i
say
anything
while
i
was
unconscious
he
whispered
replied
rex
mystified
at
all
but
what
does
all
this
mean
syd
what
is
worrying
you
so
terribly
let
it
worry
you
and
then
it
will
worry
me
less
what
time
is
it
past
we
ought
to
catch
the
six
not
strong
enough
to
go
now
objected
rex
as
pale
as
a
i
a
wan
smile
lit
up
face
for
an
instant
then
exercise
will
perhaps
bring
some
of
the
color
back
you
can
call
the
doctor
in
now
and
see
what
he
scott
arrived
with
the
filled
prescription
just
as
rex
brought
the
physician
back
into
the
room
sydney
objected
to
lying
on
the
floor
any
longer
and
they
helped
him
to
a
chair
you
can
go
home
if
you
do
any
walking
said
the
doctor
after
another
examination
right
i
can
go
down
in
the
elevator
get
a
carriage
from
the
hotel
across
the
street
and
ride
right
up
to
the
station
you
rush
down
and
engage
one
rex
scott
will
stay
here
and
help
the
doctor
down
with
me
then
he
can
go
along
with
us
lose
any
time
with
an
immensely
relieved
mind
rex
hurried
off
to
execute
the
commission
he
had
really
feared
at
one
time
that
sydney
was
going
to
die
he
was
rallying
rapidly
now
when
he
entered
the
coach
he
took
out
his
pocketbook
and
paid
the
doctor
for
his
services
owe
you
something
scott
he
added
after
they
had
started
what
you
got
at
the
drug
scott
protested
but
was
in
the
end
obliged
to
take
what
he
had
paid
out
been
an
exciting
afternoon
for
you
fellows
remarked
sydney
and
rex
could
not
help
but
notice
that
while
his
tone
was
light
his
face
was
still
pale
and
that
he
did
not
look
at
them
while
he
was
speaking
want
you
to
promise
me
one
thing
though
that
you
will
not
speak
of
my
fainting
spell
at
home
or
you
either
scott
i
have
a
particular
reason
for
asking
that
both
boys
promised
to
respect
his
wishes
and
then
sydney
quickly
changed
the
subject
to
the
trip
asking
at
what
hotels
they
were
going
to
stop
and
so
on
until
the
carriage
reached
the
station
he
seemed
so
much
better
by
this
time
that
when
he
met
a
friend
on
the
train
and
took
a
seat
with
him
rex
and
scott
almost
forgot
that
he
had
been
ill
they
found
places
together
near
by
but
neither
said
much
during
the
short
ride
rex
felt
that
scott
must
be
thinking
of
how
sydney
had
broken
in
upon
his
revelation
of
their
inheritance
and
wondering
what
it
could
mean
he
explain
it
so
he
thought
best
not
to
broach
the
subject
and
as
this
filled
so
large
a
part
of
his
thoughts
there
was
nothing
else
he
cared
to
talk
about
after
all
his
trip
to
philadelphia
had
not
been
productive
of
any
results
he
knew
no
more
now
than
when
he
started
about
the
extent
of
fortune
when
they
reached
marley
sydney
took
a
hack
that
always
waited
at
the
station
and
he
and
rex
rode
down
to
the
pellery
scott
living
close
to
the
station
in
the
other
direction
you
feel
all
right
syd
asked
rex
during
the
ride
sydney
nodded
without
making
any
reply
and
soon
they
reached
home
rex
was
unusually
silent
during
dinner
he
looked
up
in
surprised
fashion
when
he
learned
that
sydney
had
gone
off
without
his
breakfast
that
morning
sydney
explained
that
it
was
due
to
urgent
business
in
town
rex
wondered
what
the
family
would
think
if
they
knew
about
the
scene
at
the
office
that
afternoon
nobody
said
anything
about
tyler
after
sydney
had
admitted
that
he
died
before
he
left
him
the
previous
night
rex
was
the
one
most
likely
to
discourse
on
the
subject
but
now
he
had
his
reasons
for
not
broaching
it
the
next
morning
sydney
did
not
go
to
the
city
he
devoted
himself
to
making
arrangements
for
burial
the
death
was
published
in
all
the
philadelphia
papers
and
the
pells
expected
that
some
one
might
come
down
claiming
to
be
a
relative
but
no
one
appeared
and
on
saturday
the
funeral
was
held
in
the
little
house
in
burdock
all
the
pells
were
present
and
a
great
number
of
people
from
marley
the
news
that
the
miser
was
very
wealthy
and
had
left
all
his
money
except
a
small
legacy
to
his
servant
to
pell
spread
rapidly
and
created
a
great
sensation
everybody
connected
it
with
act
of
rescue
on
the
trestle
and
so
many
spoke
to
him
about
it
that
he
was
almost
afraid
to
show
himself
in
public
do
you
care
said
jess
when
he
complained
to
her
about
it
certainly
a
thing
you
are
ashamed
i
know
what
to
say
he
returned
sounds
silly
to
tell
them
it
anything
and
i
say
yes
i
think
it
was
a
very
brave
act
so
there
i
poor
boy
what
do
you
do
usually
to
get
around
it
by
telling
them
that
not
the
heir
but
mother
i
suppose
kind
of
mean
too
for
i
know
she
hates
to
be
spoken
to
about
it
as
much
as
i
the
pells
were
the
observed
of
all
observers
at
the
funeral
eva
had
declared
at
first
that
she
thought
they
ought
not
to
go
just
make
a
show
of
ourselves
she
said
was
very
unfortunate
all
this
got
out
before
tyler
was
but
pell
announced
that
respect
for
the
dead
demanded
their
presence
so
they
went
every
one
remarked
on
the
pallor
of
sydney
his
mother
had
worried
over
it
considerably
must
be
the
first
to
take
advantage
of
our
altered
circumstances
my
dear
boy
she
had
told
him
want
you
to
give
up
work
for
a
while
and
go
away
for
a
good
long
no
no
he
cried
out
in
such
terror
that
the
poor
woman
was
startled
he
noticed
it
and
tried
to
smile
as
he
went
on
course
all
this
business
about
the
tyler
will
has
been
an
extra
strain
on
me
but
that
will
soon
be
off
now
it
is
you
and
the
children
who
must
benefit
by
the
money
that
has
come
so
unexpectedly
you
will
make
me
oh
so
much
happier
if
you
will
not
count
me
in
on
it
you
will
not
need
my
help
now
and
my
income
will
be
abundant
for
my
own
seeing
that
he
felt
so
strongly
on
the
matter
pell
said
no
more
at
the
time
but
she
often
thought
of
that
talk
later
and
shivered
as
she
recalled
it
chapter
x
roy
makes
a
new
acquaintance
it
was
just
a
month
after
our
story
opened
that
july
afternoon
roy
was
fishing
from
the
tree
trunk
over
the
creek
again
but
he
was
alone
this
time
and
the
expression
on
his
face
was
almost
as
discontented
as
had
been
on
that
former
occasion
his
float
bobbed
under
two
or
three
times
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
fact
he
was
too
deeply
absorbed
in
thought
now
and
then
he
would
glance
up
at
the
trestle
far
above
him
and
something
very
like
a
sigh
would
pass
his
lips
there
was
a
snapping
of
twigs
on
the
marley
end
of
the
log
and
roy
turned
his
head
quickly
to
find
a
young
man
regarding
him
attentively
he
might
have
been
anywhere
from
to
thirty
he
had
a
small
brown
mustache
and
rather
a
dark
complexion
he
held
a
small
oblong
box
in
both
his
hands
roy
at
once
recognized
it
as
a
camera
and
realized
at
the
same
instant
that
it
was
pointed
at
him
as
their
eyes
met
the
stranger
flushed
slightly
but
said
in
a
pleasant
voice
hope
you
mind
being
taken
roy
did
mind
he
was
in
a
mood
just
now
to
object
to
everything
but
the
voice
was
such
an
agreeable
one
the
glance
of
his
eye
so
kindly
that
the
real
self
came
to
the
surface
through
his
temporarily
baser
one
and
he
replied
i
not
but
i
got
the
pleasant
look
the
photographers
tell
you
to
put
on
you
afraid
break
your
camera
the
answer
was
a
quick
snap
and
then
the
young
man
slung
the
camera
over
his
shoulder
and
stepping
out
on
the
tree
trunk
slipped
down
to
a
seat
beside
roy
have
a
very
cozy
retreat
here
he
remarked
the
fishing
know
to
tell
the
truth
i
thinking
of
my
line
at
all
and
almost
sorry
i
let
you
take
that
picture
i
see
what
you
wanted
it
for
any
way
i
hope
you
show
it
around
much
you
live
in
marley
do
you
glad
of
with
a
smile
nobody
i
know
will
be
apt
to
see
the
quite
a
modest
young
it
that
but
i
must
have
looked
so
disagreeable
at
that
particular
moment
at
least
i
must
have
done
so
if
my
looks
were
anything
like
my
if
i
remember
rightly
you
were
smiling
at
the
instant
i
pressed
the
button
you
know
you
were
saying
something
about
fearing
you
would
break
the
camera
and
a
smile
usually
goes
with
that
roy
looked
up
quickly
the
stranger
was
an
odd
one
he
had
a
queer
way
of
putting
things
roy
began
to
be
interested
you
taken
many
pictures
around
here
a
number
a
very
pretty
it
bridge
quite
adds
to
the
attractiveness
of
the
landscape
in
fact
that
is
the
reason
i
am
here
i
was
coming
through
on
the
train
and
as
we
crossed
the
prospect
of
this
little
valley
was
so
tempting
that
i
decided
to
stop
off
and
explore
i
am
very
glad
i
did
now
for
it
gave
me
the
added
pleasure
of
meeting
sounds
as
though
you
were
talking
to
a
girl
said
roy
it
well
as
i
am
particularly
fond
of
boys
i
suppose
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
the
same
sort
of
things
to
fond
of
boys
queer
i
know
any
one
liked
boys
except
their
mothers
and
now
and
then
a
girl
or
roy
laughed
a
little
as
he
added
this
last
and
the
stranger
joined
in
heartily
very
frank
he
remarked
what
boys
usually
are
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
like
them
they
generally
say
right
out
just
what
they
another
reason
the
man
with
the
camera
hesitated
an
instant
before
replying
then
he
said
going
to
be
frank
too
another
reason
i
like
boys
is
because
i
find
them
useful
to
to
you
repeated
roy
perplexed
as
a
matter
of
study
you
see
i
write
about
them
are
you
an
author
roy
turned
full
around
on
the
log
as
he
put
the
question
his
face
all
aglow
with
animation
suppose
what
i
must
call
myself
even
if
not
a
particularly
famous
tell
me
the
names
of
some
of
your
books
perhaps
read
the
young
man
smiled
at
his
eagerness
and
mentioned
a
story
which
had
been
christmas
present
two
years
before
you
write
that
he
exclaimed
then
you
are
charles
keeler
i
am
keeler
i
suppose
you
are
disappointed
in
me
most
people
are
when
they
see
the
people
who
write
books
they
have
was
a
splendid
story
roy
drew
in
a
long
breath
before
he
made
this
reply
he
was
still
looking
at
keeler
as
if
he
could
not
yet
quite
comprehend
the
thing
awfully
glad
to
meet
you
and
like
to
shake
the
greatest
of
pleasure
very
glad
you
liked
my
book
i
know
you
say
so
if
you
where
boys
are
superior
to
grown
people
they
are
almost
always
sincere
in
the
expression
of
their
you
know
never
seen
an
author
before
went
on
roy
who
had
wound
up
his
line
and
had
given
himself
over
to
a
full
enjoyment
of
this
unexpected
opportunity
see
how
you
do
it
i
hate
to
write
compositions
at
school
nearly
every
boy
i
know
does
did
you
when
i
had
to
write
on
subjects
that
were
assigned
by
the
teacher
i
used
to
count
the
lines
then
just
the
same
as
the
rest
of
the
fellows
but
when
they
let
me
write
a
story
i
see
how
you
can
i
should
think
never
know
what
to
say
keeler
smiled
showing
his
white
teeth
which
contrasted
so
strongly
with
the
deep
tan
on
his
complexion
that
all
comes
when
you
have
your
scheme
arranged
he
said
of
course
you
have
to
possess
a
natural
taste
for
the
work
you
suddenly
decide
that
you
would
like
to
be
an
author
and
then
study
for
it
as
you
might
learn
to
be
a
carpenter
or
a
like
poets
then
who
are
not
made
returned
roy
and
that
being
the
case
it
comes
natural
to
write
although
there
is
a
great
deal
of
hard
work
about
said
you
studied
boys
how
do
you
mean
take
yourself
for
example
when
i
saw
you
sitting
here
fishing
i
wanted
your
picture
so
i
could
look
at
it
some
day
and
perhaps
make
up
a
story
about
story
about
me
exclaimed
roy
then
he
added
in
a
sober
tone
believe
you
could
make
up
a
more
wonderful
story
than
something
that
has
really
happened
to
that
so
i
remember
now
you
said
you
were
very
much
disturbed
over
something
that
you
thought
would
make
you
look
i
came
down
here
because
i
was
at
odds
with
myself
and
everybody
else
i
wonder
what
do
with
a
hero
who
was
just
in
my
position
half
a
mind
to
tell
you
all
about
it
you
know
who
i
am
so
it
matter
do
you
live
in
philadelphia
in
new
york
just
at
then
i
believe
tell
you
but
you
must
promise
you
use
it
in
a
book
unless
i
tell
you
you
my
hand
on
it
and
once
more
hands
were
clasped
over
the
tree
trunk
you
must
promise
too
to
believe
everything
i
tell
you
some
of
it
will
seem
pretty
well
you
know
that
fact
is
stranger
than
fiction
so
worry
about
tell
you
everything
began
roy
with
a
quick
glance
up
at
the
trestle
first
have
to
go
back
a
little
and
say
that
almost
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
lived
in
that
house
you
can
see
down
yonder
with
the
peaked
roof
we
had
only
about
enough
money
to
keep
us
comfortable
for
father
died
when
i
was
a
little
fellow
and
there
were
five
of
us
children
but
we
had
good
times
and
i
was
looking
forward
to
the
future
when
i
would
be
a
man
and
rex
and
my
twin
give
mother
some
of
the
luxuries
with
what
we
should
earn
for
i
expected
that
by
that
time
sydney
would
be
married
and
have
a
home
of
his
own
not
bored
listening
to
all
this
are
you
a
more
exciting
part
coming
never
was
so
absorbed
in
a
story
in
my
life
my
dear
fellow
go
on
over
yonder
not
far
from
the
end
of
the
trestle
lived
an
old
never
mind
the
name
at
any
rate
he
was
sort
of
a
miser
or
rather
he
had
lots
of
money
which
he
never
spent
and
when
he
died
he
left
it
all
to
my
left
something
out
i
think
interrupted
keeler
and
there
was
a
smile
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
that
caused
roy
to
flush
deeply
chapter
xi
charles
keeler
why
you
go
on
asked
keeler
as
roy
paused
heard
something
about
the
affair
i
can
see
you
have
by
the
way
you
look
please
tell
me
what
it
a
very
little
was
the
reply
i
was
crossing
the
trestle
in
the
train
a
while
ago
i
heard
a
lady
behind
me
telling
a
gentleman
who
was
with
her
that
this
was
the
place
where
roy
pell
rescued
the
old
miser
so
now
you
see
i
know
who
you
are
but
i
hope
that
make
any
difference
about
your
telling
the
story
you
left
off
in
the
most
interesting
place
it
would
be
worse
than
the
serials
in
the
weekly
papers
for
i
look
forward
to
getting
the
continuation
next
roy
smiled
and
then
said
right
promised
not
to
use
it
unless
i
give
you
leave
you
know
but
i
want
you
to
think
of
me
as
a
regular
hero
because
i
lugged
that
old
man
off
the
bridge
there
would
have
been
plenty
of
time
for
me
to
have
run
down
to
burdock
and
stopped
the
train
and
got
help
there
but
i
really
think
of
no
that
the
part
interested
in
at
all
what
i
want
to
know
is
the
reason
you
seemed
so
glum
over
having
come
into
a
fortune
was
it
much
may
i
inquire
half
a
million
but
i
been
one
mite
happier
since
had
it
in
the
first
place
my
oldest
brother
has
been
sick
ever
since
we
know
the
matter
with
him
and
he
give
up
his
law
business
and
go
away
for
rest
as
mother
wants
him
to
he
says
he
has
got
too
much
to
do
looking
after
the
investing
of
her
money
then
rex
he
wants
so
many
things
that
he
settle
on
any
one
he
got
a
bicycle
almost
the
first
thing
and
now
tired
of
it
and
wants
a
horse
and
jess
says
no
good
of
getting
that
because
we
ought
to
go
to
europe
and
take
syd
with
eva
she
wants
to
go
to
vassar
and
mother
want
to
give
her
up
and
the
worst
of
it
all
is
sold
the
place
and
we
are
going
to
move
into
the
city
next
month
and
i
hate
to
leave
marley
although
the
rest
all
want
to
go
so
all
pulling
different
ways
and
nobody
a
bit
happy
for
if
got
what
he
wanted
he
has
to
remember
that
what
the
rest
want
i
had
a
fling
out
about
the
whole
thing
just
before
i
left
the
house
and
i
came
down
to
grumble
to
the
creek
why
funny
funny
inquired
keeler
as
roy
looked
up
with
a
half
smile
just
a
month
ago
since
rex
came
down
here
to
mope
because
we
have
money
enough
to
let
him
go
on
a
trip
to
canada
and
now
come
here
to
do
the
same
thing
because
come
into
a
you
care
for
the
money
remarked
the
author
if
going
to
break
up
a
family
the
way
it
has
ours
jess
used
to
be
awfully
lively
and
full
of
fun
and
now
all
the
time
talking
about
new
clothes
and
the
places
she
wants
to
go
and
how
going
to
have
her
room
decorated
in
the
new
i
thought
you
said
she
wanted
to
go
to
i
did
one
of
the
troubles
she
know
what
she
wants
one
thing
one
minute
and
another
the
your
mother
she
have
something
to
say
about
it
but
so
fond
of
us
all
she
wants
to
do
what
will
give
us
the
most
pleasure
and
of
course
when
we
all
want
different
things
pretty
hard
to
the
that
i
want
is
to
stay
right
here
in
marley
graduate
at
the
academy
here
next
june
and
then
all
my
friends
are
here
and
i
like
the
country
now
if
your
hero
in
a
story
was
in
a
fix
like
this
what
would
you
do
with
him
depends
on
the
sort
of
story
i
was
writing
if
it
was
one
with
a
motive
a
moral
so
to
speak
have
him
give
up
his
own
desire
and
say
be
perfectly
willing
to
do
what
the
rest
wanted
to
if
the
rest
wanted
to
do
different
things
rex
wanting
to
live
in
philadelphia
and
eva
thinking
it
would
be
ever
so
much
nicer
to
live
in
boston
and
jess
divided
half
of
the
time
between
new
york
and
europe
and
sydney
looking
as
if
drop
into
the
grave
right
off
if
we
do
something
then
roy
spoke
very
earnestly
and
keeler
did
not
smile
this
time
he
began
to
pick
at
the
bark
on
the
tree
trunk
and
did
not
reply
for
some
little
time
after
roy
had
paused
think
he
said
finally
in
that
case
i
should
have
had
my
hero
try
to
make
himself
contented
with
whichever
decision
was
arrived
at
half
a
million
ought
to
atone
for
a
great
many
i
know
a
lot
of
people
envy
us
broke
in
roy
minturn
says
i
ought
to
be
the
happiest
fellow
going
but
not
because
leave
marley
i
you
think
queer
for
me
to
tell
all
this
to
a
stranger
but
just
because
you
are
a
stranger
that
i
feel
that
i
can
do
it
you
can
understand
how
that
can
be
you
keeler
perfectly
but
i
think
you
attach
too
much
importance
to
your
feeling
for
marley
of
course
you
think
now
that
you
will
not
be
contented
elsewhere
because
you
do
not
yet
know
the
attractions
of
other
places
i
remember
when
i
was
in
my
teens
living
abroad
i
thought
i
could
not
be
happy
anywhere
but
in
paris
i
had
been
there
all
winter
and
when
spring
came
and
we
were
to
go
to
germany
i
felt
just
as
you
do
over
leaving
marley
but
when
we
were
settled
in
our
german
home
i
grew
to
like
it
just
as
i
had
paris
that
is
the
way
it
is
sure
to
be
with
done
me
lots
of
good
exclaimed
roy
should
never
have
thought
of
looking
at
things
that
way
so
lived
in
europe
rex
only
wants
to
travel
your
twin
brother
you
say
does
he
look
like
you
only
the
least
bit
he
is
the
good
looking
member
of
the
family
there
he
goes
now
on
his
wheel
would
you
like
to
meet
him
i
should
replied
keeler
heartily
would
seem
exactly
like
a
character
out
of
a
roy
put
his
fingers
between
his
lips
and
gave
a
peculiar
whistle
composed
of
three
distinct
notes
rex
who
was
just
passing
under
the
trestle
turned
around
in
his
saddle
and
when
he
saw
some
one
beside
his
brother
on
the
tree
trunk
he
made
a
half
circle
in
the
road
and
came
scudding
back
on
his
machine
he
ran
this
in
a
little
distance
among
the
trees
left
it
leaning
against
one
of
them
and
then
came
on
foot
to
the
edge
of
the
creek
his
bicycle
suit
was
very
becoming
to
him
roy
watched
face
and
saw
that
he
was
favorably
impressed
at
once
he
accomplished
the
introduction
mentioning
the
book
both
boys
had
read
rex
seemed
immensely
pleased
at
meeting
the
author
and
put
on
his
most
charming
manner
you
come
over
to
the
house
keeler
he
said
can
give
you
some
lemonade
and
like
you
to
see
the
view
of
the
trestle
from
our
are
very
kind
returned
the
young
man
looking
at
his
watch
i
am
afraid
i
shall
not
have
time
i
had
planned
to
take
the
next
train
in
to
town
i
have
only
about
twenty
minutes
in
which
to
catch
it
to
tea
then
and
go
up
some
time
this
evening
went
on
rex
am
sure
our
mother
would
be
delighted
to
meet
you
and
so
would
the
girls
they
roy
indeed
please
stay
roy
would
not
have
dared
to
make
this
request
if
he
had
been
left
to
himself
that
was
the
difference
in
character
of
the
two
brothers
one
was
impulsive
ready
to
do
anything
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
the
other
cautious
shrinking
sometimes
he
was
just
as
anxious
as
rex
to
extend
the
hospitality
of
the
pellery
to
their
new
acquaintance
but
felt
that
he
had
not
known
the
other
long
enough
to
warrant
him
in
doing
so
keeler
hesitated
he
was
in
his
element
now
in
the
society
of
two
boys
of
such
contrasted
temperaments
making
admirable
studies
was
going
back
to
new
york
he
said
i
suppose
i
could
put
it
off
till
then
you
can
stay
to
tea
at
the
pellery
exclaimed
rex
what
we
call
our
house
it
makes
it
seem
like
a
nest
you
know
if
you
mind
mount
my
wheel
and
run
on
ahead
to
tell
them
you
are
coming
so
that
we
can
receive
you
in
proper
there
was
no
opportunity
given
keeler
to
decline
rex
rushed
ahead
mounted
his
wheel
and
was
off
before
he
could
answer
will
stay
you
asked
roy
pleasure
if
you
think
it
will
not
inconvenience
your
mother
that
is
decidedly
important
you
do
not
know
but
i
may
be
some
moonshiner
from
the
cumberland
or
a
bandit
from
italy
my
complexion
certainly
answers
to
the
latter
description
you
see
you
have
only
my
word
for
who
i
really
guess
good
enough
laughed
roy
do
you
like
rex
does
i
suppose
we
ought
to
be
very
proud
of
him
and
we
are
but
then
we
are
afraid
for
him
at
the
same
time
what
a
boy
he
is
see
hunted
up
our
big
flag
and
hung
it
from
window
in
honor
of
your
coming
have
to
make
a
speech
chapter
xii
an
alarming
discovery
rex
come
down
to
the
gate
to
meet
them
sorry
that
mother
home
he
said
just
had
a
telegram
from
syd
that
takes
her
to
town
and
will
keep
her
there
with
him
all
night
some
business
connected
with
the
new
house
he
added
with
a
glance
at
roy
the
girls
are
home
and
will
be
delighted
to
receive
you
with
fitting
honors
he
went
on
he
did
not
say
that
he
had
had
quite
a
time
to
induce
them
to
appear
at
all
he
had
rushed
into
the
house
in
his
impetuous
way
announcing
that
roy
was
coming
along
with
a
young
man
they
had
met
down
at
the
creek
who
was
a
famous
author
and
was
so
nice
and
whom
they
had
invited
to
tea
we
know
him
rex
eva
had
exclaimed
in
considerable
dismay
to
bring
strange
people
to
the
house
in
that
but
just
the
same
thing
as
if
we
did
know
him
and
rex
went
on
to
explain
about
the
story
he
had
written
which
they
had
all
read
and
admired
is
he
nice
and
respectable
himself
jess
inquired
know
some
of
these
writers
are
horribly
poor
and
go
about
with
threadbare
clothes
he
might
not
be
the
right
sort
of
man
for
us
to
know
at
eva
exclaimed
severely
idea
of
your
thinking
that
because
people
are
poor
they
be
respectable
we
shall
be
very
glad
to
meet
your
friend
rex
and
jess
felt
that
she
was
in
such
disgrace
that
when
keeler
was
presented
she
tried
to
redeem
herself
by
being
excessively
friendly
and
this
was
not
difficult
for
her
to
do
he
was
certainly
very
different
from
what
she
had
expected
he
had
neither
long
hair
like
the
traditional
poet
nor
trousers
fringed
around
the
bottom
like
the
literary
hireling
of
grub
street
indeed
she
found
him
quite
handsome
he
dressed
almost
as
well
as
rex
did
and
he
was
a
most
interesting
talker
and
all
the
while
she
was
sensible
of
having
seen
his
face
somewhere
before
she
thought
at
first
it
might
have
been
in
a
portrait
painted
as
a
frontispiece
to
his
book
at
the
first
opportunity
she
slipped
off
to
the
room
and
looked
it
up
but
there
was
no
portrait
there
finally
she
decided
that
she
must
have
passed
him
in
the
street
in
the
city
some
time
and
resolved
to
think
no
more
about
it
eva
was
pleased
with
the
visitor
too
they
had
a
very
merry
supper
party
the
clash
of
opinions
about
what
to
do
with
their
money
was
stilled
for
the
time
while
they
all
listened
to
the
very
entertaining
stones
told
by
their
guest
he
was
it
seemed
on
his
way
home
from
the
oil
regions
of
pennsylvania
whither
he
had
gone
to
secure
the
local
color
for
a
new
story
in
fact
he
had
traveled
very
extensively
in
his
short
life
for
he
was
not
yet
thirty
at
one
time
he
had
lived
among
a
tribe
of
blacks
in
africa
at
another
been
a
member
of
a
party
of
exiled
russians
on
tramp
to
the
mines
of
siberia
he
was
telling
of
an
exciting
adventure
he
had
had
among
the
arabs
when
the
twinkling
lights
in
a
train
crossed
the
trestle
caused
him
to
come
to
a
sudden
pause
must
be
thinking
of
the
time
he
said
taking
out
his
watch
and
trying
to
see
the
figures
on
its
face
by
the
moonlight
want
to
miss
the
last
train
in
to
do
please
pleaded
rex
can
stay
here
just
as
well
as
not
syd
be
home
and
you
can
have
his
room
the
last
train
goes
in
half
an
hour
you
nearly
have
exhausted
your
stock
of
stories
by
then
please
should
be
very
glad
to
have
you
do
so
keeler
said
eva
this
is
trespassing
altogether
too
much
on
your
hospitality
he
returned
you
scarcely
know
me
and
i
come
prepared
i
left
philadelphia
this
morning
meaning
to
be
back
there
by
fix
you
out
said
rex
with
an
air
of
finality
go
on
with
your
arab
it
was
most
comfortable
on
that
porch
with
its
southern
exposure
the
fireflies
dancing
to
the
chirp
of
the
crickets
the
span
of
the
railroad
trestle
looking
like
a
fairy
bridge
against
the
background
of
the
sky
keeler
decided
to
stay
roy
wondered
what
the
others
would
think
if
they
knew
that
their
guest
was
aware
of
what
had
recently
befallen
the
family
he
should
most
decidedly
not
have
told
all
he
had
if
he
had
foreseen
what
was
coming
at
ten
eva
suggested
that
keeler
was
probably
tired
from
his
journey
so
the
boys
went
up
stairs
with
him
come
down
and
lock
up
roy
called
back
to
his
sisters
when
he
returned
in
a
few
minutes
leaving
rex
talking
bicycle
with
their
guest
he
found
the
girls
standing
in
the
library
over
a
large
book
which
they
had
open
on
the
table
before
them
there
exclaimed
jess
almost
in
a
tragic
tone
just
as
he
entered
she
was
pointing
at
something
in
the
upper
left
hand
corner
of
the
page
eva
started
as
she
looked
at
it
and
then
turned
a
frightened
face
toward
roy
come
here
she
said
the
matter
with
you
girls
he
exclaimed
look
as
if
each
seen
a
worse
than
that
answered
jess
in
a
sepulchral
tone
she
pointed
to
the
spot
on
which
gaze
had
been
riveted
picture
exclaimed
roy
what
it
says
underneath
went
on
jess
in
the
same
tone
roy
let
his
eyes
drop
to
the
printed
lines
beneath
the
portrait
which
was
one
of
six
which
adorned
the
page
this
is
what
he
read
martin
blakesley
george
confidence
book
is
this
asked
roy
his
voice
was
hard
he
hardly
recognized
it
himself
when
he
heard
it
criminals
of
the
united
states
replied
jess
brought
it
home
last
week
to
look
up
something
or
other
he
wanted
to
use
in
a
case
i
was
glancing
through
it
this
morning
and
saw
this
picture
then
i
knew
seen
keeler
somewhere
before
as
soon
as
i
laid
eyes
on
him
this
only
somebody
that
looks
like
him
said
eva
faintly
has
a
larger
mustache
than
that
had
plenty
of
time
to
grow
rejoined
jess
significantly
book
was
published
two
or
three
years
ago
see
here
is
his
history
no
and
she
began
to
look
over
the
pages
till
she
came
to
the
paragraphs
of
description
accompanying
the
portrait
the
three
heads
bent
over
the
page
eagerly
while
roy
in
a
low
voice
read
the
facts
about
no
he
had
been
in
jail
twice
it
seemed
his
last
term
having
expired
as
roy
figured
some
four
months
previous
he
was
noted
for
his
suave
manners
and
the
facility
with
which
he
imposed
on
strangers
the
man
murmured
jess
are
we
going
to
do
eva
stepped
back
to
the
sofa
and
sank
down
upon
it
as
if
every
bit
of
strength
had
gone
away
from
her
seem
possible
was
all
roy
could
say
for
the
moment
then
he
turned
back
to
the
picture
and
studied
it
long
and
intently
meanwhile
the
steady
murmur
of
voices
could
be
heard
from
above
rex
was
showing
keeler
the
treasures
in
their
room
had
better
go
up
and
ask
him
to
leave
then
said
roy
suddenly
no
no
that
will
precipitate
a
quarrel
exclaimed
jess
may
murder
us
do
you
want
me
to
do
then
asked
roy
see
that
you
can
do
anything
except
sit
up
with
eva
and
me
down
here
till
morning
sure
i
should
never
sleep
a
wink
if
i
went
to
hoping
yet
be
some
way
to
prove
we
are
mistaken
in
thinking
him
the
same
person
put
in
eva
might
take
this
book
up
roy
and
show
it
to
him
then
if
he
flush
when
he
saw
this
picture
know
it
was
all
if
it
poor
roy
might
be
stabbed
where
he
stood
added
jess
cheerfully
tell
you
we
might
cry
fire
and
scare
him
out
that
be
silly
jess
roy
admonished
her
and
then
he
returned
once
more
to
the
study
of
the
face
of
the
criminal
there
was
a
sudden
crash
up
stairs
jess
uttered
a
half
stifled
scream
roy
she
cried
go
and
see
he
may
have
killed
poor
rex
chapter
xiii
discussion
of
ways
and
means
roy
bounded
up
the
stairway
two
steps
at
a
time
he
was
conscious
that
both
his
sisters
had
walked
to
the
foot
of
it
and
were
looking
after
him
fearfully
then
he
heard
voice
evidently
his
brother
was
not
hurt
it
matter
in
the
least
rex
was
saying
was
an
old
thing
we
have
taken
it
with
us
to
the
new
he
and
keeler
were
bending
over
a
heap
of
fragments
on
the
floor
roy
stepped
into
the
room
and
saw
that
they
had
once
been
the
clock
that
stood
on
a
bracket
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
reaching
up
to
get
that
nest
we
stuck
behind
it
rex
explained
coat
sleeve
caught
on
the
clock
and
pulled
the
whole
thing
roy
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
then
almost
smiled
as
he
recalled
what
he
and
his
sisters
had
thought
for
a
minute
had
really
happened
he
bent
down
and
helped
the
others
to
pick
up
the
pieces
think
this
should
be
a
warning
to
me
to
go
to
bed
at
once
said
keeler
with
a
laugh
boys
i
shall
be
on
hand
for
eight
he
went
out
into
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
to
the
third
floor
where
roy
had
already
lighted
the
lamp
for
him
in
room
awfully
nice
fellow
he
roy
remarked
rex
rolling
the
fragments
of
the
clock
up
in
an
old
newspaper
roy
did
not
make
any
reply
he
had
sat
down
on
a
chair
by
the
bureau
on
which
he
was
resting
his
elbow
his
eyes
were
fixed
thoughtfully
on
the
book
rack
opposite
in
which
stood
the
volume
of
which
keeler
was
the
author
he
said
suddenly
on
got
to
go
down
any
way
with
this
rubbish
but
come
over
you
roy
you
look
as
sober
as
a
judge
in
a
criminal
show
you
in
the
library
was
all
reply
then
recollecting
that
the
girls
would
be
anxious
to
hear
his
report
he
hurried
out
and
down
the
stairs
eva
and
jess
were
still
standing
by
the
newel
post
they
asked
in
a
breath
was
only
the
old
clock
rex
knocked
down
keeler
has
gone
up
to
you
tell
rex
not
yet
here
he
comes
eva
went
out
and
showed
her
brother
where
to
deposit
the
contents
of
the
newspaper
then
she
brought
him
back
into
the
library
and
pointed
out
the
portrait
of
martin
blakesley
rex
understood
at
once
what
it
meant
for
he
had
been
looking
at
the
book
he
brought
out
this
low
whistle
and
then
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
companions
think
it
is
the
same
man
then
said
roy
looks
exactly
like
him
and
i
suppose
it
would
be
as
easy
for
him
to
take
the
name
keeler
as
any
other
there
is
a
charles
keeler
went
on
roy
know
these
men
would
dare
masquerade
around
the
country
as
such
famous
people
they
would
be
sure
to
be
found
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
asked
rex
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
though
he
had
himself
invited
keeler
to
the
house
he
was
now
putting
all
the
responsibility
on
his
brother
sit
down
and
talk
it
over
calmly
replied
roy
been
thinking
the
thing
over
and
i
see
what
harm
it
can
do
to
let
keeler
a
confidence
man
exclaimed
rex
and
jess
in
a
breath
may
have
reformed
continued
roy
plan
deliberately
to
come
to
this
house
nothing
he
has
said
or
done
since
he
has
been
here
has
made
us
suspect
him
of
being
anything
else
than
what
he
claimed
to
if
he
has
reformed
what
would
he
be
going
around
pretending
to
be
what
he
for
interrupted
jess
suppose
that
martin
blakesley
and
charles
keeler
the
author
are
one
and
the
same
person
do
you
roy
did
not
answer
for
a
minute
he
had
plainly
not
thought
of
this
side
of
the
matter
it
makes
me
creep
went
on
jess
feel
that
a
man
who
has
been
in
prison
twice
is
in
this
very
house
and
going
to
stay
here
all
night
going
to
stay
up
until
morning
i
think
sit
down
here
and
read
the
lives
of
these
criminals
it
will
be
an
appropriate
girls
stay
up
at
all
said
rex
and
i
will
stand
i
sleep
if
i
went
to
bed
declared
jess
know
as
i
can
ever
sleep
again
so
long
as
we
are
in
this
house
think
how
he
must
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
it
by
this
time
silly
you
talk
jess
interposed
eva
would
think
to
hear
you
that
keeler
was
a
common
burglar
as
roy
says
he
plan
to
come
here
and
like
as
not
go
away
in
the
morning
without
having
disturbed
us
in
the
standing
up
for
him
are
you
eva
well
i
thought
his
good
looks
were
making
an
impression
on
you
have
no
right
to
talk
in
that
way
not
standing
up
for
him
at
all
only
trying
to
get
you
to
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
in
a
sensible
nothing
sensible
in
inviting
a
jail
bird
to
the
house
and
having
him
stay
all
night
it
the
sort
of
thing
you
can
prepare
yourself
to
bear
up
under
in
dignified
i
go
up
to
town
and
get
the
constable
to
come
down
and
arrest
him
asked
rex
do
that
returned
roy
promptly
committed
any
if
we
wait
till
he
does
commit
one
it
will
be
like
locking
the
stable
door
after
the
horse
has
been
might
go
over
to
the
roy
and
get
will
to
come
and
stay
with
us
eva
suggested
rouse
them
up
at
this
hour
of
the
night
getting
on
to
be
eleven
and
it
would
be
a
pretty
reason
to
give
it
you
please
burton
we
invited
a
convict
to
spend
the
night
with
us
and
now
eva
resist
smiling
at
way
of
putting
it
rex
yawned
heavily
awfully
sleepy
he
said
and
you
and
rex
were
the
ones
who
were
to
stand
guard
jess
reminded
him
promptly
beginning
to
agree
with
eva
now
rex
returned
an
idea
that
man
intends
to
harm
any
of
us
perhaps
there
is
some
mistake
after
all
and
he
martin
blakesley
only
somebody
that
looks
like
go
to
bed
on
any
such
uncertainty
as
that
declared
jess
would
we
do
if
we
stayed
up
and
we
heard
him
coming
down
stairs
to
burglarize
the
house
rex
wanted
to
know
you
and
roy
shaking
in
your
boots
too
much
to
take
aim
you
might
bring
him
to
a
halt
by
pointing
pistol
at
his
suppose
we
could
ask
him
to
wait
first
till
we
ran
up
to
bureau
drawer
and
got
it
retorted
rex
with
fine
irony
sakes
there
he
is
right
in
the
room
with
the
only
weapon
got
in
the
house
and
jess
looked
really
terrified
now
one
of
you
think
to
take
it
out
you
think
to
tell
us
who
keeler
was
before
we
asked
him
to
stay
all
night
eva
retorted
said
you
knew
all
the
time
you
had
seen
him
somewhere
boys
had
no
business
to
pick
up
a
stranger
and
bring
him
to
the
house
in
this
way
jess
replied
do
you
suppose
mother
will
say
when
we
tell
her
tell
her
said
rex
tell
her
exclaimed
jess
she
finds
half
the
silver
gone
and
pistol
missing
i
suppose
we
can
say
that
the
cat
carried
them
i
pick
the
fellow
up
affirmed
rex
was
roy
he
called
to
me
to
come
and
meet
you
invited
him
to
the
house
roy
resist
adding
interposed
eva
quarreling
over
what
is
past
and
decide
what
we
must
do
in
the
present
for
my
part
i
think
we
are
in
any
personal
danger
if
the
man
up
stairs
is
the
same
one
described
in
the
book
he
has
evidently
remember
what
it
says
about
his
smooth
ways
interjected
jess
is
just
where
he
has
made
his
reputation
by
his
easy
way
of
crawling
into
tell
you
what
to
do
said
roy
and
rex
eva
go
up
to
bed
jess
and
i
will
stay
up
all
night
and
stand
what
good
will
that
do
you
if
you
any
weapons
rex
wanted
to
know
can
run
any
way
answered
jess
will
be
better
than
lying
still
to
be
murdered
in
our
after
some
further
discussion
the
matter
was
settled
in
this
way
chapter
xiv
what
happened
at
midnight
when
rex
and
eva
had
gone
up
stairs
and
jess
and
roy
were
left
to
themselves
in
the
parlor
the
brother
and
sister
looked
at
each
other
rather
soberly
for
the
first
few
minutes
you
very
sleepy
roy
asked
jess
presently
she
sat
by
the
table
still
with
that
book
about
criminals
open
before
her
but
she
had
not
looked
at
it
for
some
time
now
not
a
bit
shall
i
read
you
something
that
book
of
mark
we
finished
put
my
mind
to
listen
to
anything
i
never
was
so
nervous
in
my
life
and
getting
really
nothing
to
be
nervous
about
jess
i
have
no
doubt
that
keeler
is
in
bed
sound
asleep
by
this
time
with
no
thought
of
burglarizing
the
wish
i
could
think
so
but
i
of
something
else
then
when
are
we
going
to
leave
marley
first
of
september
the
new
house
is
a
beauty
you
seen
it
yet
have
you
and
i
know
as
i
ever
want
come
roy
it
is
ridiculous
your
being
so
set
or
staying
in
marley
we
can
come
out
here
in
the
summer
perhaps
although
prefer
to
go
must
have
been
nice
to
live
in
europe
for
a
while
as
keeler
did
you
get
so
well
acquainted
with
the
wonder
if
they
got
well
acquainted
with
him
remarked
jess
significantly
i
forgot
returned
roy
and
then
he
remembered
what
keeler
had
said
to
him
down
by
the
creek
about
trying
to
make
himself
contented
with
whatever
was
for
the
good
of
the
greatest
number
it
could
not
be
possible
that
a
man
who
could
give
such
excellent
advice
had
a
record
behind
him
like
martin
blakesley
you
want
me
to
read
to
you
roy
added
shall
we
do
then
what
do
you
say
to
a
game
of
authors
right
keeler
represented
so
i
guess
i
can
stand
roy
took
the
cards
from
the
drawer
of
the
bookcase
and
they
began
to
play
but
thoughts
wandered
and
roy
was
obliged
to
remind
her
to
take
her
turn
many
times
suddenly
she
held
up
a
finger
hushing
him
to
silence
you
hear
something
she
asked
in
a
tremulous
whisper
but
the
crickets
outside
and
the
splash
of
the
water
over
the
dam
he
replied
something
in
the
house
up
stairs
hear
it
now
like
the
creaking
of
a
roy
did
hear
it
this
time
plainly
rex
or
eva
he
said
reassuringly
it
see
nearly
midnight
they
were
asleep
long
ago
oh
roy
that
man
may
stop
on
the
way
down
and
murder
them
jess
had
risen
and
stood
there
staring
toward
the
doorway
into
the
hall
her
eyes
filled
with
terror
roy
rose
too
he
realized
that
the
noise
was
not
likely
to
be
made
by
his
brother
or
sister
and
the
servant
slept
in
the
rear
of
the
house
and
always
used
the
back
stairs
he
had
often
wondered
whether
he
would
be
brave
in
a
time
of
real
danger
as
fellows
in
the
books
he
read
were
he
did
not
feel
by
any
means
comfortable
now
but
he
was
not
actually
terrified
go
up
and
see
what
it
is
jess
he
said
and
started
toward
the
door
but
his
sister
flung
herself
upon
him
the
tears
starting
from
her
eyes
leave
me
or
i
shall
die
she
moaned
she
drew
him
back
toward
a
sofa
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
and
held
him
tightly
by
the
wrist
the
noise
from
above
drew
nearer
they
made
it
out
to
be
the
creaking
of
the
stairs
jess
was
trembling
frightfully
roy
could
almost
hear
her
teeth
chatter
he
wished
that
he
could
think
of
something
to
say
to
make
her
feel
less
terrified
he
was
sure
if
he
had
been
a
boy
in
a
book
he
could
have
thought
of
something
he
determined
to
ask
keeler
in
the
morning
what
would
be
the
proper
thing
under
the
circumstances
then
he
laughed
out
half
hysterically
as
he
realized
that
it
would
hardly
be
the
thing
to
mention
the
matter
to
keeler
jess
heard
the
laugh
and
it
frightened
her
more
than
ever
she
thought
roy
was
more
terrified
even
than
she
and
was
losing
control
of
himself
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
creak
of
descending
footsteps
roy
started
to
go
to
the
door
he
felt
that
he
could
not
remain
in
suspense
an
instant
longer
but
jess
held
him
back
roy
she
whispered
will
kill
and
at
that
instant
a
form
passed
the
doorway
it
was
keeler
he
had
on
his
trousers
shirt
and
shoes
but
nothing
else
his
hair
was
all
rumpled
and
one
hand
was
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
as
though
he
had
been
feeling
his
way
he
halted
for
an
instant
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
turned
his
face
toward
the
library
then
roy
saw
that
his
eyes
were
closed
walking
in
his
sleep
he
whispered
to
jess
must
go
and
wake
him
or
he
may
do
himself
some
him
alone
he
may
go
out
and
then
we
can
lock
the
door
against
would
you
be
as
cruel
as
that
he
asleep
he
may
be
only
going
to
find
out
at
any
rate
there
fumbling
with
the
lock
better
take
the
opportunity
to
go
up
jess
still
held
on
to
her
wrist
but
now
she
suffered
herself
to
be
led
across
the
floor
to
the
hall
reaching
which
she
let
go
and
sped
up
stairs
roy
turned
at
once
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
their
guest
some
way
his
fears
and
suspicions
of
the
man
had
all
departed
keeler
he
said
in
a
firm
tone
the
other
left
off
his
working
with
the
lock
and
a
tremor
ran
through
him
roy
slipped
his
hand
down
till
it
rested
under
the
elbow
into
the
library
and
sit
down
a
moment
he
said
gently
am
i
what
have
i
been
doing
roy
knew
that
the
man
was
awake
now
have
been
walking
in
your
sleep
he
replied
beg
your
pardon
did
you
dress
and
come
down
after
me
no
i
been
to
bed
roy
flushed
as
he
made
this
answer
and
at
this
moment
the
clock
on
the
mantel
chimed
out
twelve
strokes
you
in
the
habit
of
sitting
up
till
midnight
asked
keeler
he
paused
suddenly
his
gaze
had
fallen
on
that
book
of
criminals
jess
had
left
lying
open
on
the
table
what
appeared
to
be
his
own
portrait
stared
back
at
him
from
the
corner
of
the
right
hand
page
heart
almost
stood
still
for
a
second
as
he
saw
that
the
whole
thing
was
out
keeler
dropped
into
a
chair
by
the
table
still
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
that
picture
finally
he
raised
them
and
looked
at
roy
have
discovered
the
likeness
then
he
said
there
was
a
depth
of
misery
in
his
tone
that
went
straight
to
the
heart
he
said
oldest
brother
is
a
lawyer
you
know
he
brought
this
book
home
you
thought
i
was
this
man
went
on
keeler
know
what
else
to
think
answered
roy
in
a
low
voice
you
were
going
to
sit
up
all
night
to
make
sure
that
i
run
off
with
the
silver
the
smile
that
accompanied
these
words
was
a
very
sad
one
then
the
face
grew
suddenly
grave
again
and
without
waiting
for
roy
to
make
a
response
to
his
awkward
question
keeler
continued
blame
you
for
thinking
that
brother
martin
and
i
were
one
and
the
same
person
he
is
only
a
year
younger
than
i
and
people
could
never
tell
us
apart
when
we
were
boys
i
remember
we
used
to
help
them
out
by
wearing
sleeve
buttons
an
m
on
his
and
a
c
on
mine
were
left
orphans
when
very
young
and
mart
began
to
go
to
the
bad
at
once
it
commenced
with
robbing
nests
and
orchards
and
ended
with
the
confidence
game
for
which
he
was
last
sent
to
jail
that
is
the
reason
i
use
my
pen
name
always
i
wonder
if
you
believe
what
i
am
telling
keeler
i
do
responded
roy
heartily
am
sorry
i
stayed
went
on
the
author
should
not
have
run
the
risk
i
had
had
nobody
to
vouch
for
me
here
you
see
i
will
go
away
now
if
you
say
no
no
i
am
so
sorry
it
happened
it
was
only
the
merest
chance
we
found
out
anything
about
it
all
right
involuntarily
roy
put
out
his
hand
the
other
took
it
with
a
glad
light
in
his
eyes
then
roy
turned
out
the
lamp
and
they
both
went
up
stairs
it
was
many
a
week
before
the
young
people
of
the
pell
family
ceased
to
talk
among
themselves
over
their
singular
experience
with
charles
keeler
he
left
on
the
nine
express
the
next
morning
and
everybody
had
been
pleasant
to
him
at
the
breakfast
table
except
jess
who
did
not
come
down
roy
told
the
true
state
of
the
case
before
he
went
to
bed
that
night
and
the
explanation
was
very
gladly
received
by
both
rex
and
eva
may
be
so
jess
replied
take
my
breakfast
after
he
is
roy
told
sydney
about
the
occurrence
and
thought
at
first
from
his
looks
that
he
was
going
to
give
him
a
severe
rating
for
what
he
had
done
a
sort
of
convulsive
tremor
shook
his
frame
and
he
hastily
took
out
his
handkerchief
to
wipe
away
the
beads
of
perspiration
that
had
gathered
on
his
forehead
but
he
uttered
no
word
of
reproof
merely
said
that
the
boys
should
be
careful
about
the
friends
they
made
you
think
keeler
is
all
right
syd
asked
roy
as
it
turned
out
certainly
i
do
was
the
reply
it
might
have
been
for
his
part
roy
was
very
glad
of
the
meeting
since
he
had
had
that
interview
down
by
the
creek
he
had
been
much
more
reconciled
to
leaving
marley
if
i
had
the
burden
to
carry
about
with
me
that
keeler
has
he
often
told
himself
consciousness
that
my
brother
was
a
scoundrel
a
jailbird
chapter
xv
dudley
harrington
the
family
moved
into
their
city
home
early
in
september
and
a
beautiful
one
it
was
with
enough
ground
about
it
to
give
windows
on
all
sides
of
course
a
small
army
of
servants
was
necessary
to
the
running
of
such
a
dwelling
and
roy
eva
and
jess
had
many
laughable
experiences
at
first
in
accustoming
themselves
to
being
waited
on
but
rex
took
to
luxury
as
naturally
as
a
duck
to
water
he
seemed
to
be
growing
up
terribly
fast
since
a
fortune
had
come
into
the
family
he
insisted
on
having
a
latch
key
as
soon
as
they
moved
to
town
and
felt
very
much
aggrieved
because
his
mother
would
not
buy
him
a
dog
cart
you
are
too
young
my
son
pell
said
in
response
to
this
request
you
are
not
yet

shall
be
next
month
he
replied
i
know
perfectly
well
how
to
manage
a
horse
been
out
with
scott
so
he
had
had
scott
and
charlie
minturn
to
visit
him
just
as
soon
as
they
were
settled
and
took
solid
satisfaction
in
entertaining
them
in
the
style
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
at
their
homes
but
they
did
not
seem
to
have
any
better
time
than
they
used
to
do
down
at
at
marley
in
fact
they
had
enjoyed
it
there
because
things
were
different
now
it
was
rex
who
was
different
they
could
not
state
in
just
what
the
difference
lay
but
they
felt
it
and
when
they
had
gone
rex
realized
that
he
had
not
enjoyed
their
visit
as
much
as
he
had
expected
to
to
be
sure
the
was
there
at
the
thought
of
having
entertained
them
as
he
had
long
wished
to
be
able
to
do
but
then
there
had
seemed
a
constraint
which
had
not
existed
before
the
trouble
was
here
he
had
relied
on
externals
to
please
them
this
time
and
had
not
exerted
himself
personally
as
he
had
been
wont
to
do
in
fact
rex
was
not
at
heart
as
contented
as
he
had
expected
to
be
to
be
sure
he
had
now
all
the
clothes
he
wanted
shoes
galore
and
more
spending
money
than
any
boy
of
fifteen
ought
to
have
but
all
the
while
he
was
thinking
that
he
was
missing
something
and
he
was
not
exactly
sure
what
this
was
he
thought
he
had
discovered
one
of
the
things
toward
the
latter
part
of
september
when
the
people
who
occupied
the
adjoining
house
to
the
pells
returned
to
town
they
were
evidently
a
family
of
great
harringtons
rex
found
what
their
name
was
from
the
servants
there
was
a
young
man
in
the
harrington
he
was
about
twenty
and
affected
the
sharpest
crease
to
his
trousers
the
highest
puffs
to
his
neckties
carried
his
cane
with
the
handle
down
and
was
altogether
a
dude
of
the
latest
type
to
become
acquainted
with
this
splendid
youth
now
grew
to
be
reginald
one
absorbing
ambition
he
had
always
preferred
to
associate
with
boys
older
than
himself
to
be
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
a
young
man
out
of
his
teens
and
who
sported
a
mustache
that
was
far
advanced
in
the
budding
would
be
a
triumph
indeed
but
would
he
be
able
to
accomplish
his
purpose
although
he
was
tall
for
his
age
rex
could
not
hope
that
the
object
of
his
admiration
would
look
upon
him
as
anything
else
than
a
schoolboy
but
he
did
not
see
him
go
out
with
many
fellows
of
his
own
age
he
seemed
to
be
the
only
child
the
parents
were
elderly
people
and
the
son
was
a
good
deal
by
himself
rex
saw
him
sometimes
in
his
own
room
his
feet
on
the
table
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
the
floor
around
him
strewn
with
newspapers
wonder
if
he
ride
a
wheel
he
asked
himself
one
day
half
a
mind
to
ask
him
to
go
out
with
me
neighbors
there
be
anything
out
of
the
way
in
my
speaking
to
the
school
which
rex
and
roy
were
to
attend
did
not
open
till
the
first
of
october
so
the
boys
had
a
good
deal
of
time
on
their
hands
just
at
present
roy
spent
much
of
it
at
marley
visiting
his
friends
there
rex
was
thus
left
to
his
own
devices
on
one
of
these
days
of
absence
rex
was
riding
his
wheel
in
the
park
when
he
passed
dudley
harrington
also
mounted
on
a
silent
steed
instinctively
almost
rex
half
bowed
it
seemed
natural
to
do
so
when
this
fellow
lived
right
next
door
and
was
so
frequently
in
his
thoughts
he
was
half
alarmed
at
his
temerity
when
some
one
rode
up
by
his
side
and
said
day
for
wheeling
it
it
was
harrington
he
had
circled
about
and
caught
up
with
him
rex
was
so
overwhelmed
that
he
nearly
lost
his
balance
but
he
recovered
himself
in
an
instant
and
his
natural
repose
of
manner
asserted
itself
indeed
he
answered
was
wondering
if
you
had
a
wheel
most
fellows
have
one
this
mine
one
i
hired
i
keep
mine
at
new
a
yale
man
then
exclaimed
rex
prouder
than
ever
at
having
formed
this
acquaintance
go
back
next
week
was
the
answer
glad
enough
be
too
fearfully
slow
here
at
this
time
of
year
nobody
back
in
town
i
know
have
been
myself
only
the
governor
fell
sick
and
i
want
the
mater
to
come
on
alone
with
are
inquired
rex
respectfully
bless
you
no
only
sophomore
by
the
way
you
have
just
moved
into
that
house
next
door
you
about
three
weeks
there
was
a
stupid
lot
enough
there
before
you
a
set
of
old
maids
most
of
you
must
be
sociable
and
come
in
to
see
a
fellow
a
pool
table
you
out
there
rex
was
glad
a
man
in
a
buggy
stopped
suddenly
in
front
of
him
just
then
calling
for
this
diversion
in
subject
he
did
not
know
how
to
play
pool
and
did
not
care
to
confess
the
fact
just
then
when
they
were
riding
on
unhindered
again
he
begun
to
talk
about
yale
and
led
the
other
on
to
relate
several
of
his
first
year
experiences
by
the
time
they
struck
the
pavements
again
they
were
quite
well
acquainted
me
pell
it
said
harrington
as
they
dismounted
between
the
two
houses
and
harrington
put
out
his
hand
awfully
glad
to
have
met
you
pell
i
say
come
in
and
see
a
fellow
you
that
is
if
you
anything
better
to
rex
privately
thought
that
he
possibly
have
this
but
he
only
said
be
most
happy
to
the
friendship
thus
begun
progressed
very
rapidly
rex
speedily
learned
how
to
play
pool
but
of
this
he
said
nothing
at
home
harrington
seemed
to
have
taken
a
decided
fancy
to
the
fellow
who
did
not
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
proud
to
be
acquainted
with
him
one
source
of
regret
was
the
fact
that
they
were
so
soon
to
be
separated
say
reggie
said
harrington
suddenly
on
the
day
before
his
departure
you
come
over
to
new
haven
with
me
just
on
a
visit
i
mean
give
you
no
end
of
a
good
time
stop
a
night
in
new
york
on
the
way
oh
you
must
chapter
xvi
rex
determines
to
take
matters
into
his
own
hands
cup
of
joy
was
full
when
dudley
harrington
asked
him
to
go
to
new
haven
with
him
it
would
be
pleasure
indeed
to
go
anywhere
in
company
with
that
fascinating
young
gentleman
but
to
visit
a
college
town
in
his
company
to
be
introduced
as
his
would
be
bliss
indeed
thought
rex
but
on
top
of
this
realization
of
how
much
he
wanted
to
go
came
the
fear
that
he
could
not
obtain
permission
to
accept
it
was
a
humiliating
reminder
of
his
youth
rex
felt
to
reflect
that
he
must
ask
his
mother
before
coming
to
any
decision
love
to
go
harrington
he
said
let
you
know
about
it
in
the
morning
that
will
be
time
enough
it
leave
on
the
limited
at
five
i
think
get
our
dinner
on
board
and
be
ready
for
fun
in
new
york
when
we
get
there
i
say
why
you
decide
now
reggie
i
guess
i
can
go
stammered
rex
he
hated
to
confess
that
he
must
first
ask
leave
can
i
get
back
he
asked
by
saturday
or
you
can
stay
over
till
monday
with
me
if
you
will
we
never
do
much
the
first
of
the
term
and
got
plenty
of
room
in
my
the
pells
knew
that
rex
had
formed
the
acquaintance
of
harrington
they
also
knew
that
he
was
to
go
to
college
in
a
few
days
so
if
pell
feared
any
evil
influence
over
reginald
she
consoled
herself
with
the
thought
that
this
would
be
removed
in
a
very
short
time
now
when
rex
came
with
the
request
that
he
be
allowed
to
go
to
new
haven
with
his
new
friend
her
answer
was
a
prompt
and
decided
as
good
as
told
him
go
mother
he
pleaded
had
no
right
to
do
that
rejoined
pell
be
in
your
element
at
all
in
the
company
of
his
friends
and
of
course
you
are
sure
to
meet
a
great
many
of
in
my
element
in
his
company
had
me
over
there
every
day
since
we
got
acquainted
besides
just
think
never
been
to
new
york
in
my
life
since
i
was
a
baby
and
this
will
be
a
splendid
chance
for
me
to
see
it
i
can
pay
all
my
own
expenses
so
i
be
under
obligations
to
him
please
mother
i
go
on
that
trip
with
the
bowmans
and
now
after
school
commences
i
have
another
but
pell
was
firm
she
was
a
woman
quick
to
discern
character
and
she
had
seen
enough
of
dudley
harrington
through
the
windows
to
conclude
that
he
was
not
the
sort
of
person
to
whom
she
wished
to
intrust
an
impulsive
boy
like
rex
for
two
or
three
days
she
chided
herself
now
for
having
permitted
the
intimacy
to
go
as
far
as
it
had
rex
knew
that
it
was
useless
to
say
more
and
presently
went
to
his
room
here
he
threw
himself
on
his
sofa
and
brooded
over
his
troubles
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
the
most
unlucky
fellow
that
ever
lived
he
never
could
have
what
he
wanted
even
the
money
that
he
imagined
was
going
to
bring
so
much
happiness
failed
to
keep
to
the
agreement
as
he
looked
upon
it
just
wait
till
a
little
older
he
told
himself
make
up
for
lost
time
still
this
would
not
help
him
out
of
his
present
slough
of
despond
he
thought
of
how
lonesome
he
should
be
after
harrington
went
away
the
next
day
he
could
have
scott
or
charlie
minturn
up
to
see
him
to
be
sure
but
somehow
since
he
had
known
harrington
these
old
friends
had
not
seemed
so
entertaining
to
him
as
they
once
had
that
trip
to
new
haven
would
bridge
over
the
time
nicely
till
school
opens
he
told
himself
see
why
mother
let
me
but
he
knew
perfectly
well
what
the
reason
was
he
realized
that
harrington
had
habits
which
none
of
his
associates
had
ever
had
but
what
of
it
smoke
or
drink
if
i
want
to
he
argued
done
it
yet
besides
it
will
do
me
good
to
see
a
little
of
the
he
rose
from
the
sofa
lighted
the
gas
and
just
as
he
had
done
that
day
when
he
had
heard
who
was
heir
he
collected
the
money
from
his
different
pockets
and
counted
it
up
his
allowance
was
a
liberal
one
and
he
had
been
saving
up
to
buy
a
birthday
present
for
his
mother
dollars
and
forty
cents
he
repeated
to
himself
wonder
how
much
the
fare
will
he
put
on
his
hat
and
went
down
stairs
are
you
going
rex
asked
his
mother
as
he
passed
the
group
who
were
sitting
on
the
front
porch
for
it
was
a
sultry
evening
down
the
street
a
little
way
be
right
up
he
replied
wonder
if
people
ask
him
where
going
every
step
he
takes
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
strode
off
he
forgot
the
five
difference
in
their
ages
thought
only
of
the
surveillance
under
which
he
chafed
he
kept
on
till
he
reached
the
hotels
and
entering
one
of
them
he
hunted
around
till
he
found
a
railway
guide
a
short
consultation
of
this
apprized
him
of
the
fact
that
he
had
enough
to
pay
his
fare
to
new
haven
and
back
but
very
little
more
suppose
i
shall
have
no
expense
while
there
he
mused
guest
i
think
i
may
risk
it
and
if
i
get
stuck
help
me
out
though
hate
to
ask
for
rex
had
formed
a
resolution
he
had
determined
to
go
on
the
coveted
trip
without
his
consent
he
could
leave
a
note
explaining
where
he
was
it
would
not
be
half
as
terrible
a
thing
he
argued
as
for
a
fellow
to
run
away
from
home
and
not
mean
to
come
back
there
would
be
a
great
row
raised
about
it
he
supposed
but
meanwhile
he
would
have
had
a
good
time
and
the
worst
that
they
would
do
to
him
would
be
to
send
him
away
to
boarding
school
and
he
mind
that
very
much
he
thought
all
this
out
on
his
way
back
from
the
hotel
to
be
sure
he
would
have
to
use
the
money
he
had
been
saving
up
for
his
present
but
then
he
was
in
no
mood
to
give
her
anything
now
he
felt
some
twinges
as
his
thoughts
touched
on
this
point
but
at
that
moment
some
one
took
his
stand
in
front
of
him
and
exclaimed
or
give
the
it
was
harrington
answered
rex
promptly
decided
to
go
then
said
harrington
turning
around
to
walk
back
with
him
right
have
oceans
of
fun
meet
stout
and
cheever
in
new
york
and
we
can
just
paint
the
town
i
tell
rex
was
not
certain
that
he
would
do
any
town
painting
he
would
be
quite
content
to
be
in
company
can
go
if
it
cost
too
much
he
replied
thinking
it
best
to
be
frank
on
that
point
on
the
start
see
my
allowance
a
big
one
as
yet
and
i
dare
ask
for
any
ten
dollars
will
squeeze
through
easy
harrington
said
this
as
though
ten
dollars
was
no
harder
to
get
than
ten
cents
heart
sank
where
was
he
to
obtain
the
two
dollars
and
forty
cents
he
still
lacked
you
come
in
harrington
asked
as
rex
stopped
in
front
of
the
not
meet
you
at
the
station
at
a
quarter
to
the
matter
with
my
calling
here
for
you
and
our
going
up
together
have
to
go
down
town
first
and
start
from
rex
felt
that
this
was
a
very
lame
excuse
he
was
not
accustomed
to
telling
untruths
but
harrington
seemed
not
to
notice
right
just
as
you
say
he
replied
see
you
in
the
morning
any
night
rex
called
after
him
he
felt
that
his
not
going
home
with
harrington
was
a
good
stroke
of
policy
he
decided
to
add
another
to
it
by
sitting
with
the
family
a
while
before
he
went
up
to
his
room
wanted
to
know
if
you
come
down
and
see
him
rex
began
roy
as
his
brother
seated
himself
on
the
top
step
and
began
fanning
himself
with
his
hat
told
me
to
tell
you
to
come
down
on
the
prepared
to
stay
all
heart
gave
a
sudden
leap
circumstances
seemed
to
favor
his
plan
if
he
only
had
three
dollars
more
now
guess
he
said
you
going
roy
going
to
that
ratification
meeting
with
syd
night
you
know
if
you
go
down
to
marley
rex
better
come
with
us
there
are
to
be
some
fine
i
will
responded
rex
he
was
turning
over
in
his
mind
how
he
was
going
to
get
that
money
the
matter
of
his
getting
off
to
the
station
was
simple
enough
now
he
could
even
go
with
harrington
without
exciting
suspicion
it
would
be
supposed
he
was
bound
for
marley
what
a
web
of
deceit
he
was
planning
to
wind
about
himself
but
he
forcibly
put
this
thought
out
of
his
mind
whenever
it
obtruded
itself
he
would
have
time
enough
to
repent
when
he
came
back
chapter
xvii
rex

rex
had
crossed
the
hall
to
his
room
some
time
after
the

come

dollars
can
you
let
me
have
it
old
fellow
i
can
but
be
sure
to
give
it
back
to
me
monday
as
i
enough
to
get
the
present
i
have
set
my
heart
on
there
if
you
tell
about
yours
i
say
anything
about
mine
then
have
a
grand
surprise
party
all
around
on
the
roy
stepped
to
his
dressing
case
and
took
out
a
two
dollar
and
a
one
dollar
bill
which
he
handed
to
rex
ever
so
much
murmured
the
latter
night
and
he
hurried
back
to
his
own
room
he
had
never
felt
so
mean
in
his
life
not
only
had
he
just
obtained
money
under
false
pretenses
but
he
had
told
two
or
three
falsehoods
of
the
most
unblushing
description
very
readiness
to
oblige
him
added
to
his
weight
of
remorse
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
began
to
tuck
the
money
away
in
his
pocket
book
was
he
really
a
criminal
he
asked
himself
how
horrified
they
had
all
been
when
they
thought
charles
keeler
had
been
an
inmate
of
jails
was
it
any
worse
to
have
committed
a
crime
and
have
been
punished
for
it
than
to
commit
the
crime
and
not
be
found
out
for
a
moment
or
two
he
i
call
it
tempted
go
back
to
his
room
return
the
three
dollars
and
confess
the
whole
thing
then
he
thought
of
new
york
of
his
induction
to
a
college
town
of
his
promise
to
harrington
to
meet
him
at
the
station
i
must
go
now
he
reflected
can
call
it
sowing
my
wild
oats
and
he
undressed
as
quickly
as
possible
and
got
into
bed
as
if
fearful
that
his
repentant
tendencies
would
conquer
in
spite
of
him
he
was
very
quiet
the
next
day
about
ten
harrington
came
in
to
see
him
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
to
the
house
rex
had
not
asked
him
thinking
he
had
no
special
attractions
to
offer
him
pell
and
the
girls
were
out
shopping
roy
was
down
at
the
office
with
syd
rex
asked
harrington
if
he
would
like
to
come
up
in
his
room
course
i
would
a
generally
curious
about
the
inside
of
a
house
when
been
looking
on
the
outside
of
it
half
the
days
of
his
so
rex
took
him
up
stairs
he
admired
the
as
he
called
it
immensely
till
you
see
mine
at
yale
he
added
as
he
struck
a
match
to
light
his
inveterate
cigarette
do
much
fixing
up
at
home
here
here
so
little
by
the
way
you
mind
me
smoking
do
you
no
replied
rex
faintly
nevertheless
he
was
wondering
what
his
mother
would
say
if
the
odor
still
lingered
when
she
came
sydney
did
not
smoke
at
all
and
the
entire
family
abominated
cigarettes
pell
did
come
home
shortly
after
harrington
had
taken
his
departure
she
came
up
to
the
third
floor
to
put
away
some
flannels
she
had
bought
for
the
boys
she
said
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
have
been
rex
was
reading
by
the
window
and
he
turned
around
in
startled
disquiet
i
mother
he
replied
quickly
does
that
smell
of
cigarette
smoke
come
from
then
and
pell
coughed
and
then
came
up
close
to
look
her
son
in
the
eye
harrington
has
been
here
he
replied
was
are
sure
you
were
not
smoking
with
him
went
on
pell
adding
with
a
sudden
bending
down
over
him
rex
complied
glad
indeed
that
this
time
at
any
rate
there
was
nothing
he
wished
to
conceal
me
for
doubting
you
reggie
said
his
mother
as
she
lingered
an
instant
to
stroke
the
hair
back
from
his
forehead
once
more
rex
weakened
in
his
purpose
if
one
can
be
said
to
weaken
when
he
is
really
stronger
for
the
moment
to
resist
an
impulse
for
evil
but
then
he
reflected
that
now
he
had
the
money
and
the
opportunity
of
getting
off
to
the
station
without
being
questioned
the
facts
seemed
to
will
that
he
should
go
and
he
went
stopping
for
harrington
at
half
past
four
when
they
reached
the
station
he
found
that
he
had
to
pay
a
dollar
extra
for
the
privilege
of
riding
over
to
new
york
in
the
chicago
limited
but
it
was
very
select
to
travel
on
such
a
train
and
the
dinner
that
he
and
harrington
ate
en
route
was
one
long
to
be
remembered
in
fact
there
were
so
many
new
and
novel
sensations
and
impressions
received
from
this
first
stage
of
his
trip
that
rex
was
surprised
he
did
not
derive
more
solid
enjoyment
from
it
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
keep
out
of
his
mind
however
the
fact
that
he
was
now
supposed
to
be
at
marley
with
scott
bowman
he
had
come
away
without
leaving
behind
him
the
note
he
had
at
first
planned
to
write
must
come
to
yale
sure
reggie
harrington
told
him
you
get
ready
to
enter
next
fall
be
a
junior
then
and
can
look
out
for
you
you
wish
i
could
returned
rex
rather
more
soberly
than
the
nature
of
the
subject
seemed
to
warrant
he
was
thinking
that
it
would
be
so
much
pleasanter
to
go
to
new
haven
legitimately
than
in
his
present
stolen
fashion
when
they
arrived
at
new
york
harrington
said
he
would
go
at
once
to
the
hotel
where
he
was
to
meet
some
of
rex
wondered
whether
they
were
going
to
stop
at
this
hotel
over
night
and
if
to
how
much
it
would
cost
but
he
decided
he
would
not
ask
but
wait
and
find
out
it
was
nearly
eight
when
harrington
sent
up
his
card
to
ashley
stout
in
one
of
the
plainer
looking
hotels
on
upper
broadway
word
came
back
that
stout
was
in
his
room
on
the
fifth
floor
and
would
be
glad
to
have
harrington
come
up
on
reggie
said
the
philadelphian
rex
was
not
sure
whether
he
liked
harrington
to
call
him
reggie
sometimes
it
seemed
to
place
him
on
a
more
familiar
footing
with
the
collegian
and
at
other
times
he
had
a
suspicion
that
the
name
was
employed
merely
to
recall
to
the
younger
the
fact
of
the
difference
in
their
ages
stout
proved
to
be
a
young
man
with
a
red
face
a
very
unpleasant
complexion
and
an
abnormally
weak
voice
he
had
neither
coat
vest
nor
collar
on
and
his
eyes
looked
as
if
the
bell
knock
had
awakened
him
from
a
sound
sleep
to
see
you
harri
old
boy
he
said
shaking
harrington
vigorously
by
the
hand
appearances
was
just
taking
a
snooze
to
prepare
for
the
apologies
jack
let
me
introduce
my
friend
reginald
pell
a
neighbor
of
mine
at
home
going
up
to
yale
with
me
to
see
if
he
likes
it
well
enough
to
be
one
of
us
next
to
know
any
friend
of
sure
and
stout
gave
rex
a
hand
that
was
so
disagreeably
clammy
that
the
younger
lad
could
scarcely
resist
the
impulse
to
take
out
his
handkerchief
and
wipe
off
the
touch
of
it
from
the
conversation
that
ensued
he
ascertained
that
stout
came
from
somewhere
up
in
new
york
state
and
that
for
some
reason
or
other
he
appeared
to
be
quite
a
favorite
with
his
classmates
one
or
two
others
were
expected
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
the
hope
that
they
might
go
to
the
theater
was
now
quenched
in
breast
harrington
and
stout
talked
volubly
of
things
in
which
he
was
not
the
least
college
men
new
haven
girls
fraternity
affairs
and
the
like
rex
sat
there
listening
trying
to
look
as
if
he
were
having
a
good
time
but
failing
signally
however
this
made
no
difference
as
neither
harrington
nor
stout
paid
any
attention
to
him
presently
stout
began
to
complete
his
dressing
talking
all
the
while
although
he
was
not
angry
he
seemed
to
find
it
necessary
to
interlard
his
conversation
with
some
very
strong
and
unpleasant
sounding
expressions
and
once
or
twice
harrington
followed
his
example
in
fact
the
latter
did
not
appear
to
be
the
same
fellow
here
in
new
york
that
he
was
at
home
once
in
a
while
he
looked
at
rex
and
smiled
as
if
mutely
reminding
the
latter
that
he
owed
the
good
time
he
was
having
to
him
but
rex
found
it
harder
and
harder
to
smile
back
and
he
welcomed
a
knock
that
by
and
by
came
at
the
door
as
signalizing
change
of
some
sort
chapter
xviii
rex
sees
a
horrible
spectacle
three
new
fellows
followed
the
knock
into
the
room
they
were
noisily
greeted
by
stout
and
harrington
in
the
confusion
it
was
some
time
before
rex
was
introduced
tom
cheever
was
a
tall
youth
continually
feeling
of
his
upper
lip
as
if
to
see
if
his
mustache
had
arrived
dan
tilford
had
a
narrow
face
pallid
from
much
cigarette
smoking
and
an
eye
that
never
seemed
fixed
on
any
object
he
gazed
at
harry
atkins
was
a
handsome
fellow
of
eighteen
who
seemed
of
quieter
temperament
than
the
others
stout
gave
an
order
to
the
boy
who
had
shown
the
last
callers
up
and
the
lad
presently
appeared
staggering
under
a
big
bowl
of
what
stout
declared
was
the
new
york
could
brew
yourselves
fellows
he
cried
that
the
last
night
of
vacation
only
comes
once
a
the
room
was
already
filled
with
cigarette
smoke
two
or
three
of
these
cigarettes
had
been
offered
to
rex
but
he
had
declined
with
a
vacillating
now
thank
when
the
punch
was
passed
around
he
took
the
glass
that
was
handed
to
him
but
only
pretended
to
drink
he
did
not
care
for
liquor
he
knew
that
it
would
give
him
a
headache
he
was
having
a
terribly
stupid
time
as
it
was
it
was
not
worth
while
to
aggravate
it
by
the
addition
of
physical
suffering
he
was
appalled
at
the
swiftness
with
which
the
others
tossed
off
the
drink
it
seemed
scarcely
five
minutes
before
stout
was
calling
out
up
again
men
to
the
coming
year
may
none
of
us
be
plucked
and
ponies
be
he
took
up
glass
after
glass
and
refilled
it
rex
saw
what
was
coming
and
tried
to
be
prepared
for
it
pell
exclaimed
the
hospitable
host
drunk
a
drop
what
does
this
mean
drink
thank
you
stammered
rex
conscious
that
he
ought
to
look
the
other
straight
in
the
eye
as
he
made
this
response
but
dropping
his
handkerchief
so
that
he
might
have
an
excuse
to
stoop
down
and
pick
it
up
instead
yes
you
do
when
you
are
among
gentlemen
like
us
harrington
came
forward
hastily
to
say
this
the
others
held
their
glasses
half
way
to
their
lips
and
watched
for
the
outcome
with
interest
if
rex
were
the
hero
of
this
tale
it
would
doubtless
be
my
pleasant
duty
to
record
the
fact
that
he
lifted
the
glass
from
the
table
poured
the
contents
into
the
bowl
and
said
that
he
could
not
go
back
on
his
principles
but
rex
unfortunately
is
not
of
the
stuff
of
which
heroes
are
made
he
felt
that
he
would
rather
endure
a
headache
than
the
jeers
of
those
five
fellows
course
he
said
feebly
and
drank
off
the
glassful
at
one
draft
now
for
another
said
stout
promptly
filling
it
up
again
rex
had
never
signed
the
pledge
but
he
knew
that
his
mother
did
not
want
him
to
touch
liquor
and
it
had
been
no
deprivation
for
him
to
refrain
as
he
did
not
like
it
what
he
had
just
drunk
burnt
his
throat
like
fire
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
possibly
swallow
any
more
his
misery
showed
itself
in
his
face
atkins
who
was
standing
just
opposite
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
on
which
the
punch
bowl
had
been
placed
saw
it
say
pell
he
called
out
softly
here
a
he
stepped
over
to
the
open
window
which
looked
out
on
an
airshaft
wondering
what
he
wanted
rex
followed
him
the
others
were
busy
with
the
punch
want
that
i
know
whispered
atkins
want
any
more
either
look
as
he
spoke
he
dexterously
emptied
his
glass
out
of
the
window
rex
was
quick
to
follow
his
example
fellows
know
when
had
enough
he
said
somebody
ought
to
keep
a
level
head
on
his
shoulders
to
look
out
for
heart
sank
within
him
and
it
was
for
this
that
he
had
spent
the
money
he
had
been
saving
for
his
birthday
gift
for
this
he
had
deceived
this
mother
for
this
told
those
falsehoods
to
roy
you
fellows
ready
for
another
round
called
out
stout
looking
over
at
them
up
to
the
office
and
get
a
his
voice
already
began
to
sound
thick
must
go
and
pretend
to
join
them
atkins
whispered
so
glasses
were
filled
for
the
third
time
and
on
this
occasion
atkins
retired
with
rex
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
watching
his
opportunity
poured
his
punch
into
the
water
pitcher
rex
in
trying
to
do
likewise
let
slip
the
glass
and
it
fell
with
a
crash
into
the
basin
a
roar
of
laughter
greeted
the
incident
for
you
pell
cried
tom
cheever
to
infuse
a
little
life
into
the
party
right
my
boy
the
fellow
came
over
toward
rex
walking
a
little
unsteadily
and
with
such
a
leer
in
his
eye
that
rex
shrank
back
against
the
wall
at
that
moment
harrington
came
up
and
put
his
arm
around
neck
always
said
that
reggie
pell
was
a
gentleman
he
mumbled
you
can
see
it
for
his
clothes
fit
him
added
dan
tilford
as
a
special
mark
of
approval
they
imagine
having
no
end
of
sport
whispered
atkins
at
harrington
half
seas
over
he
was
so
far
over
indeed
that
he
was
very
ill
for
a
time
it
was
a
fearful
scene
pell
atkins
called
to
him
from
the
bed
where
he
had
gone
to
look
after
cheever
what
you
can
do
for
your
and
rex
went
over
to
harrington
and
tried
to
pilot
him
to
a
seat
then
he
held
the
head
and
shut
his
eyes
while
he
wondered
if
there
was
ever
such
a
donkey
on
the
face
of
the
earth
as
he
reginald
pell
to
do
all
that
he
had
done
for
this
if
it
been
close
on
to
midnight
he
would
have
gone
home
there
and
then
but
now
harrington
was
well
nigh
helpless
and
rex
knew
nothing
about
new
york
where
was
he
going
to
sleep
that
night
harrington
was
in
no
condition
to
have
questions
put
to
him
now
a
fixed
look
came
over
face
must
go
now
he
said
looking
around
for
his
hat
and
valise
not
going
off
and
leave
harrington
are
you
asked
atkins
do
anything
more
for
him
and
i
must
get
out
of
this
place
perhaps
call
in
the
morning
to
see
how
he
is
good
night
much
obliged
to
i
suppose
you
are
better
off
out
of
here
but
you
going
to
hire
a
room
in
the
hotel
i
want
to
get
as
far
away
from
the
place
as
rex
noticed
that
stout
was
looking
around
at
him
he
shut
the
door
quickly
and
hurried
off
he
breathed
a
great
sigh
of
relief
when
he
reached
the
open
air
he
turned
down
a
side
street
to
collect
his
thoughts
before
deciding
what
to
do
he
wandered
till
he
reached
the
middle
of
the
block
then
finding
his
valise
heavy
he
set
it
down
on
the
sidewalk
to
rest
a
minute
it
was
after
midnight
and
very
quiet
suddenly
he
felt
something
hit
him
in
the
face
and
then
for
a
minute
or
two
all
was
a
blank
to
him
chapter
xix
a
memorable
night
when
rex
came
to
his
senses
again
he
found
himself
leaning
against
a
brown
stone
stoop
his
head
felt
very
queer
wonder
if
it
can
be
the
effect
of
that
glass
of
punch
i
drank
he
asked
himself
then
he
glanced
down
at
the
sidewalk
and
saw
that
his
handsome
new
missing
a
terrible
fear
came
to
him
he
put
his
hand
to
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
yes
it
was
true
he
had
been
assaulted
and
robbed
in
the
street
his
money
his
return
ticket
to
philadelphia
were
gone
to
say
nothing
of
his
satchel
and
the
clothes
that
were
in
it
he
looked
helplessly
up
and
down
the
street
all
was
quiet
as
it
had
been
before
a
man
was
coming
toward
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
but
that
individual
could
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
robbing
him
no
the
thief
had
made
his
escape
long
since
and
it
was
hopeless
to
try
to
overtake
him
rex
had
one
thing
with
which
to
console
himself
his
silver
one
syd
had
recently
given
not
been
taken
he
thrust
his
hands
into
his
trousers
pockets
yes
there
was
some
loose
change
there
he
took
it
out
and
anxiously
counted
it
under
a
lamp
there
were
cents
all
told
and
now
the
question
arose
what
was
he
to
do
for
one
instant
the
expedient
of
returning
to
the
hotel
and
throwing
himself
on
the
good
will
of
those
he
had
left
there
suggested
itself
to
him
but
only
for
an
instant
the
recollection
of
the
scene
he
had
quitted
came
back
with
all
its
vividness
no
he
would
not
go
back
there
he
deserved
all
that
had
befallen
him
he
had
been
a
fool
ever
to
take
up
with
harrington
the
fellow
had
only
encouraged
him
because
it
flattered
his
vanity
to
be
looked
up
to
the
way
rex
had
looked
up
to
the
collegian
but
he
had
no
time
now
for
self
reproaches
he
must
decide
what
he
should
do
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
ten
minutes
to
one
he
did
not
remember
to
have
been
up
so
late
in
his
life
but
he
did
not
feel
sleepy
he
was
far
too
excited
for
that
i
could
only
get
back
to
philadelphia
was
his
thought
he
knew
that
the
single
fare
was
two
dollars
and
a
half
what
if
he
bought
a
ticket
to
a
place
as
far
as
his
cents
would
carry
him
he
would
be
that
much
nearer
home
at
any
rate
but
there
were
no
trains
at
this
time
of
night
what
should
he
do
with
himself
in
the
meantime
to
pay
for
a
lodging
would
only
still
further
deplete
his
scanty
stock
of
cash
poor
rex
felt
as
destitute
as
desolate
as
any
waif
in
all
that
great
city
he
had
been
cared
for
all
his
life
and
now
that
he
was
suddenly
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
he
felt
helpless
like
a
rudderless
bark
on
a
tossing
sea
for
all
he
was
much
more
ready
to
express
an
opinion
than
roy
he
had
not
half
the
push
and
energy
of
the
latter
who
although
quieter
was
nevertheless
the
more
determined
character
of
the
two
rex
walked
on
now
rapidly
till
he
reached
the
lighted
avenue
he
had
had
all
the
experience
he
wanted
of
lingering
in
the
side
street
he
halted
on
the
corner
and
looked
up
and
down
in
search
of
an
elevated
railroad
station
he
thought
he
had
better
get
down
to
where
the
train
started
so
that
he
might
be
ready
to
take
the
first
one
the
idea
of
telegraphing
home
had
already
occurred
to
him
but
he
dismissed
it
at
once
he
said
done
enough
harm
as
it
is
some
one
would
have
to
come
on
for
me
and
mother
would
worry
think
now
till
noon
and
perhaps
later
that
with
scott
perhaps
i
can
even
get
back
before
they
know
i
been
if
he
only
had
his
wheel
he
had
no
clear
idea
of
just
how
far
the
two
cities
were
apart
he
only
knew
that
it
taken
him
very
long
to
come
over
in
the
chicago
limited
he
found
the
station
of
the
elevated
and
after
waiting
a
long
time
he
boarded
a
train
the
people
scattered
through
the
cars
were
nearly
all
asleep
rex
dropped
off
himself
almost
as
soon
as
he
sank
into
a
seat
he
was
utterly
worn
out
the
next
thing
of
which
he
was
conscious
was
that
the
train
was
at
a
standstill
and
that
the
guard
was
shaking
him
with
the
words
wake
up
young
man
at
the
battery
the
train
go
any
rex
rubbed
his
eyes
it
took
him
an
instant
or
two
to
realize
where
he
was
the
guard
was
not
rough
with
him
do
you
want
to
go
he
asked
the
pennsylvania
station
answered
rex
come
too
far
you
ought
to
have
got
off
at
cortlandt
it
too
far
to
walk
back
asked
rex
mindful
of
his
small
supply
of
money
three
stations
you
can
keep
along
the
river
be
nearer
that
you
returned
rex
he
in
a
hurry
he
might
as
well
walk
but
he
was
terribly
sleepy
and
when
he
got
to
the
foot
of
the
stairway
he
became
rather
confused
he
heard
the
water
washing
against
the
sea
wall
he
walked
on
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
found
himself
standing
at
the
very
end
of
manhattan
island
looking
toward
the
bay
it
was
very
quiet
except
for
the
light
splash
of
the
waves
and
the
soft
sound
of
escaping
steam
from
an
engine
overhead
rex
was
not
certain
in
which
direction
he
ought
to
go
to
reach
the
ferry
there
seemed
to
be
water
on
both
sides
of
him
there
was
nobody
around
of
whom
to
inquire
except
a
tramp
or
two
asleep
on
one
of
the
benches
and
he
did
not
wish
to
go
near
them
he
turned
away
from
the
river
and
walked
off
through
battery
park
till
he
saw
a
policeman
the
latter
directed
him
how
to
go
looking
at
him
pretty
sharply
rex
hurried
off
but
presently
stopped
under
a
lamp
post
to
glance
at
his
watch
it
was
a
quarter
to
two
there
was
no
need
to
hurry
but
he
was
afraid
to
walk
slow
it
was
very
quiet
along
the
water
front
at
this
time
of
night
he
did
not
want
to
be
again
and
lose
his
watch
and
what
little
money
he
had
left
here
was
a
man
coming
toward
him
now
but
he
was
drunk
rex
was
not
afraid
of
him
he
was
only
filled
with
a
shame
that
sent
the
color
to
his
cheeks
why
was
dudley
harrington
any
better
than
this
reeling
sailor
and
harrington
had
been
his
ideal
he
reached
the
ferry
just
as
a
boat
went
out
he
fell
asleep
while
waiting
for
the
next
one
he
was
awakened
by
one
of
the
attendants
the
company
evidently
did
not
intend
to
allow
the
ferry
rooms
to
be
turned
into
a
free
lodging
house
the
ticket
office
was
not
open
on
the
new
york
side
so
rex
just
paid
his
ferriage
on
reaching
jersey
city
he
found
that
there
was
to
be
no
train
till
he
could
not
sleep
in
the
waiting
room
he
walked
out
in
the
streets
of
the
city
a
little
distance
but
was
so
tired
he
could
scarcely
drag
one
foot
after
the
other
he
was
so
sleepy
too
that
his
eyes
kept
closing
every
minute
then
he
was
afraid
of
meeting
a
footpad
he
did
not
know
where
to
go
to
hire
a
room
at
a
hotel
would
take
all
his
money
and
yet
he
could
not
walk
the
streets
all
night
ah
he
was
being
well
punished
for
all
his
sins
and
where
had
been
the
for
which
he
had
been
willing
to
commit
them
he
thought
of
roy
asleep
in
his
comfortable
bed
at
home
when
should
he
rex
ever
be
able
to
feel
as
cosy
in
mind
as
this
twin
brother
of
his
must
for
even
if
he
did
succeed
in
getting
home
without
something
terrible
befalling
him
there
remained
his
confession
to
make
for
he
must
tell
everything
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
that
but
this
was
in
the
future
meantime
the
present
must
be
provided
for
he
turned
and
walked
back
to
the
ferry
if
he
could
only
lie
down
somewhere
he
thought
there
was
a
boat
just
starting
out
he
paid
his
three
cents
and
went
aboard
he
fell
asleep
almost
as
soon
as
he
touched
the
seat
a
man
came
through
when
they
reached
new
york
woke
him
up
and
made
him
get
off
but
he
was
reckless
now
he
walked
out
to
the
street
but
immediately
turned
about
again
paid
another
ferriage
and
walked
on
the
boat
where
he
instantly
fell
asleep
once
more
and
he
kept
this
up
till
five
when
it
began
to
grow
light
then
he
went
ashore
to
the
station
in
jersey
city
and
bought
some
fruit
which
he
ate
for
his
breakfast
by
that
time
the
ticket
office
was
open
and
he
went
up
to
the
agent
and
asked
how
far
he
could
ride
for
fifty
cents
the
man
looked
at
him
closely
for
a
minute
way
he
inquired
then
want
to
go
to
philadelphia
rex
answered
frankly
all
his
pride
had
gone
now
only
got
fifty
cents
to
spend
on
the
ride
though
i
want
to
get
as
close
to
it
as
i
the
agent
named
a
town
and
passed
out
a
ticket
when
the
cars
were
opened
rex
lost
no
time
in
settling
himself
in
a
seat
he
put
his
ticket
in
his
hat
and
went
to
sleep
at
once
the
result
was
that
he
was
carried
past
his
stopping
place
and
the
station
at
which
he
was
set
off
was
a
few
miles
nearer
philadelphia
than
he
had
hoped
to
get
but
the
brakeman
told
him
that
the
quaker
city
was
still
fifty
miles
away
chapter
xx
the
crisis
miles
rex
repeated
these
words
to
himself
as
he
stood
on
the
platform
of
the
station
and
looked
after
the
swiftly
vanishing
cars
how
soon
that
train
would
cover
them
it
seemed
such
a
simple
thing
to
stay
on
board
and
be
carried
there
so
cruel
to
be
left
behind
simply
for
the
lack
of
a
little
more
money
it
was
still
quite
early
in
the
morning
people
were
coming
down
to
take
the
train
to
the
city
they
had
all
been
in
their
beds
and
had
a
good
sleep
doubtless
they
were
much
better
fitted
for
a
long
tramp
than
was
he
who
had
not
been
to
bed
at
all
but
he
must
set
off
at
once
he
asked
the
baggage
man
to
tell
him
the
road
to
philadelphia
there
it
is
in
front
of
you
replied
the
other
pointing
to
the
gleaming
steel
rails
no
i
mean
the
carriage
road
returned
rex
the
man
looked
surprised
but
gave
him
directions
how
to
find
it
and
presently
rex
was
tramping
down
its
dusty
length
i
can
never
get
there
by
nor
by
night
either
he
kept
saying
to
himself
i
shall
have
to
eat
and
my
money
will
not
hold
out
till
again
he
thought
of
time
to
sydney
but
where
should
he
stay
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
answer
then
he
remembered
how
ill
syd
still
looked
and
he
recalled
the
inquiry
that
afternoon
in
the
office
as
to
whether
he
had
had
a
shock
no
he
must
leave
telegraphing
as
the
very
last
resort
of
all
he
trudged
on
and
presently
saw
a
tramp
coming
towards
him
morning
said
the
fellow
halting
where
he
came
up
time
is
it
boss
rex
had
just
looked
at
his
watch
so
without
taking
it
out
he
told
the
time
the
man
took
a
step
closer
to
him
but
just
then
a
cloud
of
dust
appeared
in
the
road
and
a
buggy
came
into
view
the
tramp
moved
on
without
a
word
this
incident
did
not
tend
to
make
rex
any
more
comfortable
in
mind
and
now
his
body
was
beginning
to
rebel
his
stomach
felt
light
his
heart
heavy
and
his
limbs
appeared
to
be
weighted
with
lead
coming
to
a
spot
where
trees
grew
by
the
roadside
he
halted
and
stretched
himself
on
the
grass
to
rest
he
was
no
longer
sleepy
but
so
tired
he
felt
that
he
was
going
to
be
ill
the
thought
terrified
him
sick
out
here
on
the
highway
only
a
few
cents
in
his
pockets
and
not
a
friend
anywhere
about
it
was
growing
hot
and
he
was
getting
hungry
his
breakfast
had
been
a
very
light
one
the
last
regular
meal
he
had
eaten
was
on
the
chicago
limited
how
long
ago
that
seemed
now
he
took
out
his
money
and
counted
it
over
there
was
but
sixteen
cents
left
he
felt
that
he
could
eat
that
much
worth
for
his
very
next
meal
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
out
of
it
but
to
telegraph
home
and
he
had
better
do
it
he
decided
before
he
was
too
ill
to
attend
to
it
but
there
was
no
place
now
from
which
to
send
a
message
he
must
keep
on
till
he
came
to
the
next
town
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
had
taken
but
a
few
steps
when
some
one
came
up
from
behind
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
he
turned
quickly
in
fear
of
another
tramp
it
was
a
tramp
truly
but
a
mere
boy
not
much
older
than
himself
he
was
very
pale
and
sickly
looking
his
clothes
were
torn
in
two
or
three
places
and
his
shoes
were
worn
clear
down
to
the
uppers
he
did
not
speak
he
stood
there
looking
at
rex
amazement
depicted
in
his
gaze
made
a
mistake
he
stammered
out
at
last
thought
you
were
one
of
us
i
saw
you
lying
down
there
under
the
tree
your
shoes
were
all
dusty
i
knew
been
but
rex
did
not
feel
astonished
he
felt
so
ill
and
faint
that
his
head
swam
and
he
began
to
totter
have
to
lie
down
again
i
guess
he
said
weakly
he
had
just
time
to
move
aside
out
of
the
dust
when
he
fell
like
a
log
the
matter
are
you
sick
the
shabby
looking
youth
had
dropped
to
one
knee
beside
rex
and
was
looking
down
at
him
with
pitying
eyes
was
all
rex
had
strength
to
murmur
then
he
closed
his
eyes
and
did
not
care
what
became
of
him
the
strange
lad
let
his
other
knee
sink
to
the
earth
and
remained
in
this
attitude
for
several
minutes
gazing
earnestly
at
rex
chap
he
muttered
make
out
what
doing
tramping
the
country
this
way
he
look
poor
i
do
with
him
the
first
thing
to
be
done
evidently
was
to
get
him
out
of
the
sun
which
beat
down
on
the
spot
where
he
had
fallen
with
fierce
intensity
the
stranger
bent
over
and
exerting
all
his
strength
lifted
rex
in
his
arms
and
bore
him
back
along
the
road
to
the
grassy
strip
under
the
trees
where
he
had
recently
been
lying
rex
opened
his
eyes
for
an
instant
when
he
felt
himself
raised
from
the
ground
then
when
he
saw
the
pity
in
the
plain
face
looking
down
into
his
he
closed
them
again
with
a
little
sigh
and
now
once
more
the
strange
youth
sat
contemplating
the
boy
who
seemed
to
be
a
tramper
like
himself
but
who
in
every
other
respect
was
so
vastly
different
he
noted
the
fine
delicately
chiseled
features
the
smallness
of
his
feet
the
whiteness
and
smoothness
of
his
hands
he
had
seen
boys
like
this
before
but
he
had
never
before
touched
one
never
had
one
of
them
dependent
on
him
as
it
were
as
this
fellow
appeared
to
be
now
miles
harding
did
not
know
just
what
to
do
with
the
responsibility
and
yet
he
was
happy
at
having
it
he
felt
glad
that
he
had
been
able
to
do
that
little
thing
of
carrying
the
boy
from
the
sun
into
the
shade
it
was
not
often
that
he
was
able
to
do
anything
for
anybody
he
was
always
in
need
of
having
something
done
for
himself
he
tried
to
think
of
something
else
he
might
do
he
noticed
that
head
did
not
seem
to
rest
very
comfortably
he
took
off
his
coat
and
started
to
make
a
roll
of
it
for
a
pillow
but
he
stopped
when
he
had
it
half
finished
he
like
that
he
muttered
looking
down
at
the
garment
as
he
unrolled
it
again
it
had
been
made
for
a
man
there
were
rents
in
two
places
and
plentiful
sprinklings
of
grease
spots
the
day
was
growing
steadily
warmer
even
under
the
tree
one
felt
the
heat
catch
cold
without
his
own
miles
murmured
and
he
bent
over
rex
and
lifted
him
gently
while
he
tried
to
take
off
his
coat
rex
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
him
again
as
if
in
protest
was
going
to
make
a
pillow
for
you
out
of
your
coat
miles
explained
feel
able
to
walk
till
we
get
to
a
house
do
you
rex
slowly
shook
his
head
he
was
in
that
condition
which
sometimes
comes
to
those
in
seasickness
when
he
care
whether
he
lived
or
died
you
got
pain
went
on
miles
when
i
walk
answered
rex
then
as
if
talking
too
hurt
him
he
closed
his
eyes
and
sank
back
upon
the
pillow
the
other
made
for
him
out
of
his
coat
meantime
clouds
had
been
gathering
in
the
west
miles
had
been
too
much
occupied
with
his
unexpected
charge
to
notice
them
but
now
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
threatening
aspect
of
the
heavens
with
troubled
countenance
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
strode
out
into
the
middle
of
the
road
looking
first
in
one
direction
then
the
other
his
eye
brightened
as
he
saw
a
buggy
coming
from
the
westward
he
watched
impatiently
till
it
came
up
and
then
saw
that
it
contained
two
men
he
held
up
his
hand
as
a
signal
for
them
to
stop
but
the
driver
who
had
been
talking
earnestly
with
his
companion
cut
the
horse
with
his
whip
shook
his
head
and
drove
on
miles
remained
there
standing
in
the
road
a
hopeless
droop
coming
over
his
whole
figure
think
i
want
to
beg
of
them
i
suppose
he
told
himself
shall
i
do
already
the
sun
had
gone
under
the
cloud
masses
and
the
air
was
much
cooler
the
wind
rose
and
began
to
rustle
the
leaves
quite
a
distance
off
down
the
road
in
the
direction
whence
the
buggy
had
come
the
red
tops
of
two
chimneys
could
be
seen
peeping
above
the
trees
stay
here
in
the
rain
miles
muttered
must
try
to
get
him
to
that
he
turned
to
rex
again
he
took
the
coat
from
under
his
head
and
made
him
put
it
on
going
to
storm
he
said
going
to
carry
you
to
that
was
all
rex
had
strength
to
say
going
to
try
returned
miles
and
he
gathered
rex
up
in
his
arms
just
as
the
wind
came
sweeping
down
upon
them
in
a
gust
that
was
ominous
of
that
which
was
to
follow
chapter
xxi
miles
harding
it
was
physically
impossible
for
miles
harding
to
carry
rex
very
far
without
stopping
to
rest
the
life
of
a
tramp
with
insufficient
nourishment
was
not
calculated
to
strengthen
the
long
arms
which
could
easily
wrap
themselves
about
the
other
boy
but
had
little
power
to
retain
him
in
their
embrace
but
miles
fought
to
do
his
best
he
only
consented
to
stop
and
deposit
his
burden
on
the
grass
when
he
felt
that
did
he
not
do
so
he
would
be
compelled
to
drop
it
then
after
resting
a
moment
or
two
he
would
be
off
again
you
will
strain
yourself
rex
whispered
once
protestingly
but
only
answer
was
must
you
be
out
here
in
the
in
this
way
they
progressed
until
they
had
nearly
reached
the
house
then
the
rain
began
to
come
down
in
torrents
miles
made
a
last
desperate
effort
picking
rex
up
he
ran
the
intervening
distance
although
it
was
twice
as
far
as
he
usually
bore
his
burden
without
stopping
he
dashed
in
at
the
gate
and
then
so
exhausted
was
he
that
he
sank
down
beside
rex
when
he
deposited
the
latter
on
the
floor
of
the
piazza
he
lay
there
breathing
hard
while
the
rain
came
down
in
sheets
he
had
not
even
strength
to
turn
his
head
when
he
heard
the
screen
door
behind
him
open
and
some
one
come
out
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
the
question
was
put
by
a
very
sweet
girlish
voice
and
the
girl
who
put
it
was
herself
exceedingly
pretty
she
had
opened
the
door
that
led
out
from
the
wide
breezy
hall
and
stepped
upon
the
piazza
she
now
looked
down
upon
the
two
boys
lying
there
with
undisguised
astonishment
then
she
came
around
so
that
miles
could
see
her
beg
your
pardon
miss
he
said
stopping
between
every
three
or
four
words
to
take
breath
wanted
to
out
of
this
was
the
i
hope
you
he
ill
she
asked
face
was
turned
partly
towards
her
it
was
very
pale
now
but
florence
raynor
was
thinking
also
how
very
handsome
it
was
and
in
what
contrast
to
that
of
the
fellow
who
had
answered
her
very
sick
afraid
replied
miles
he
your
brother
went
on
florence
no
miles
hesitated
before
he
added
the
last
word
then
when
he
had
said
it
a
look
of
pride
came
into
his
eyes
for
an
instant
call
mother
said
the
girl
and
she
hurried
off
to
the
kitchen
where
raynor
was
making
cake
mama
she
exclaimed
noise
i
heard
was
two
tramps
who
had
come
in
on
our
piazza
out
of
the
rain
at
least
one
of
them
is
a
tramp
and
the
other
is
the
nicest
looking
boy
about
the
age
of
our
bert
sick
and
just
as
pale
but
dressed
very
well
and
i
understand
how
they
came
to
be
together
you
come
out
and
see
them
please
raynor
scraped
the
dough
from
her
lingers
and
followed
her
daughter
to
the
front
porch
miles
had
gone
over
to
take
head
on
his
knee
and
was
softly
stroking
the
hair
back
from
the
damp
forehead
yes
the
poor
fellow
is
very
ill
raynor
exclaimed
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
she
scarcely
gave
a
glance
at
miles
she
stood
for
one
instant
as
if
thinking
deeply
then
with
a
resolved
tone
she
turned
to
harding
you
help
me
get
him
up
stairs
and
in
bed
she
asked
guess
so
miles
replied
got
my
breath
back
now
i
have
to
carry
him
you
know
awfully
good
to
take
him
in
this
must
be
terribly
hard
hearted
to
turn
away
one
in
his
condition
between
them
they
lifted
rex
and
bore
him
into
the
house
and
up
the
broad
easy
stairs
to
a
little
room
at
the
head
of
them
must
get
these
wet
clothes
off
at
once
said
raynor
and
miles
stayed
there
to
help
her
they
put
him
to
bed
and
then
the
good
lady
declared
that
they
ought
to
have
a
doctor
me
go
for
one
miles
exclaimed
want
to
do
something
for
raynor
now
that
rex
no
longer
absorbed
her
entire
attention
turned
her
gaze
on
his
companion
miles
colored
beneath
it
you
think
fit
to
go
he
said
slowly
it
was
turn
to
color
now
she
saw
that
this
fellow
so
shabbily
dressed
was
of
very
sensitive
nature
a
happy
way
of
turning
the
thing
off
occurred
to
her
are
wet
too
she
said
it
is
raining
still
i
will
have
the
man
from
the
barn
she
hurried
off
down
stairs
to
call
him
miles
lingered
looking
toward
the
bed
where
lay
the
fellow
who
had
attracted
him
so
strongly
they
want
me
hanging
around
here
any
longer
he
mused
can
do
everything
for
him
there
is
to
be
done
but
i
want
to
leave
miles
nature
was
a
singular
one
for
a
boy
brought
up
as
he
had
been
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
when
he
was
hardly
more
than
twelve
he
had
received
some
pretty
hard
knocks
from
the
world
but
the
hardness
of
these
had
not
cultivated
a
like
hardness
in
him
whom
they
struck
his
temperament
had
always
been
a
sympathetic
one
he
had
many
times
received
harsh
treatment
that
would
never
have
come
to
him
by
seeking
to
protect
some
persecuted
cat
or
dog
thus
far
the
recipient
of
his
kindly
ministrations
had
always
been
some
dumb
animal
now
that
the
opportunity
had
offered
to
extend
these
to
a
human
being
miles
was
loath
to
put
it
aside
a
nice
fellow
he
is
he
murmured
wonder
where
he
belongs
just
then
florence
came
to
the
door
the
thought
instantly
flashed
into
brain
that
she
had
been
sent
there
to
see
that
he
did
not
steal
anything
but
he
was
accustomed
to
being
the
object
of
such
suspicions
and
yet
somehow
the
idea
that
he
should
be
hurt
him
more
than
usual
on
the
present
occasion
mother
would
like
to
see
you
down
stairs
said
florence
will
stay
here
with
miles
went
down
and
found
raynor
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
has
just
occurred
to
me
she
said
you
may
think
it
best
to
send
to
the
home
of
this
young
man
who
is
he
a
troubled
look
came
over
face
he
feared
that
what
he
was
about
to
say
would
settle
the
matter
once
for
all
about
his
being
allowed
to
stay
with
the
fellow
up
stairs
but
he
had
to
tell
the
truth
know
his
name
he
answered
fell
in
with
him
on
the
road
but
so
much
like
to
do
something
for
him
you
are
sure
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
have
already
done
a
great
deal
for
him
returned
raynor
as
i
understand
you
carried
him
in
here
out
of
the
rain
and
you
any
idea
where
he
belongs
i
saw
him
lying
on
the
grass
as
i
was
walking
along
the
road
i
was
going
to
trenton
to
try
and
get
a
job
in
the
potteries
there
but
like
to
find
out
how
he
gets
shall
sit
down
on
the
porch
here
while
i
take
your
coat
in
and
hang
it
by
the
stove
to
dry
send
tim
for
the
doctor
at
when
raynor
returned
up
stairs
a
little
later
florence
met
her
at
the
door
of
her
room
where
rex
had
been
carried
bert
being
away
at
boarding
school
very
sick
you
think
mama
she
asked
afraid
so
my
dear
i
want
to
do
all
i
can
for
him
i
help
thinking
how
grateful
i
should
be
to
have
any
one
do
as
much
for
our
see
what
nice
clothes
he
wears
went
on
florence
in
the
same
whispering
tone
do
you
suppose
he
ever
got
into
association
with
that
fellow
down
stairs
dear
cautioned
her
mother
those
poor
clothes
is
a
very
warm
is
he
going
to
stay
too
went
on
florence
wants
to
perhaps
we
can
find
something
for
him
to
do
about
the
you
think
honest
though
must
run
our
chances
on
that
he
is
certainly
very
different
from
most
fellows
of
his
the
doctor
arrived
inside
of
an
hour
he
made
an
examination
and
then
reported
that
rex
was
in
for
a
bad
case
of
intermittent
fever
may
not
be
able
to
be
moved
for
six
weeks
he
added
and
rex
knew
nothing
of
it
but
began
to
toss
in
the
delirium
of
his
fever
living
over
again
some
of
the
bitter
experiences
of
the
past
few
hours
chapter
xxii
searching
for
rex
train
did
rex
say
he
would
be
back
on
roy
this
was
the
question
asked
by
pell
at
the
breakfast
table
on
the
morning
that
rex
was
trudging
along
the
dusty
road
between
new
york
and
philadelphia
say
replied
roy
surely
be
home
by
lunch
though
scott
is
going
to
west
chester
with
his
mother
at
lunch
hour
arrived
and
still
no
reginald
but
pell
did
not
worry
he
had
so
many
friends
in
marley
that
there
were
plenty
of
places
where
he
might
have
gone
from
the
but
when
dinner
time
came
and
he
had
not
yet
appeared
the
entire
family
began
to
speculate
on
the
reasons
for
it
probably
at
the
minturns
said
sydney
when
informed
of
the
facts
may
have
persuaded
him
to
stay
over
another
night
with
should
have
sent
us
word
then
rejoined
his
mother
another
day
passed
and
by
this
time
pell
began
to
grow
seriously
alarmed
must
go
down
to
marley
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
roy
she
said
and
roy
went
repairing
first
to
the
he
found
scott
just
about
to
take
his
mother
out
in
his
cart
have
you
done
with
that
brother
of
mine
roy
began
when
greetings
had
been
exchanged
like
to
know
why
that
brother
of
yours
permit
himself
to
be
heard
from
returned
scott
promptly
show
up
wednesday
night
nor
send
me
any
message
explaining
why
he
come
echoed
roy
you
mean
to
say
that
rex

here
course
he
and
i
think
it
mighty
shabby
of
the
queerest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
said
roy
slowly
is
it
he
started
to
come
down
here
wednesday
afternoon
by
the
did
it
was
now
turn
to
look
astonished
you
say
he
never
got
here
went
on
roy
course
he
you
suppose
we
have
him
smuggled
away
somewhere
do
you
you
any
idea
where
your
brother
is
here
interrupted
mrs
bowman
were
sure
he
was
here
somewhere
in
marley
answered
roy
he
be
if
he
come
to
you
could
have
happened
to
the
fellow
said
scott
beginning
to
see
that
the
matter
was
more
serious
than
he
had
at
first
supposed
imagine
the
strangest
thing
i
ever
heard
roy
looked
really
worried
thought
he
might
possibly
be
at
the
but
he
have
gone
there
till
he
had
been
down
that
seat
behind
jump
in
and
drive
you
over
there
said
scott
but
charlie
had
not
seen
or
heard
from
rex
in
ten
days
nor
was
news
to
be
obtained
of
him
from
any
other
of
his
marley
friends
roy
went
home
seriously
alarmed
he
hated
to
bring
such
a
report
to
his
mother
but
he
knew
it
would
be
better
that
she
should
be
informed
of
all
the
facts
she
was
somewhat
stunned
at
first
at
the
tidings
but
quickly
rallied
must
find
him
she
said
has
happened
to
him
did
you
think
to
ask
apgar
if
he
remembered
seeing
rex
on
his
train
wednesday
night
apgar
was
the
conductor
on
the
express
go
down
to
the
station
and
ask
him
this
afternoon
before
he
goes
roy
returned
with
the
announcement
that
apgar
was
sure
rex
had
not
been
on
his
train
there
is
only
one
other
pell
looked
very
grave
as
she
spoke
is
that
mother
she
did
not
reply
at
once
reginald
was
very
dear
to
her
she
hated
to
expose
his
failings
even
to
his
own
brother
but
it
must
be
done
remember
roy
she
went
on
he
teased
me
to
let
him
go
to
new
haven
with
young
harrington
it
is
possible
he
may
have
gone
after
all
i
wish
you
would
go
in
next
door
and
see
if
you
can
find
roy
instantly
recalled
the
three
dollars
rex
had
borrowed
from
him
but
he
said
nothing
of
it
he
went
at
once
to
make
his
call
next
door
he
asked
for
harrington
telling
the
servant
that
he
wished
to
see
her
on
a
matter
of
importance
he
sent
up
his
name
roy
pell
are
the
young
man
my
son
speaks
of
said
harrington
when
she
appeared
in
the
great
drawing
room
and
put
up
her
lorgnette
to
survey
her
caller
that
is
reginald
my
brother
i
called
in
to
find
out
if
he
went
off
to
new
haven
with
your
you
know
nothing
of
his
whereabouts
yourselves
harrington
did
not
seek
to
conceal
her
surprise
roy
felt
humiliated
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
admit
the
fact
are
afraid
he
may
have
gone
off
without
my
leave
he
said
was
very
anxious
to
go
with
your
son
he
had
an
invitation
to
go
down
to
marley
the
same
day
we
thought
he
had
gone
but
we
find
now
that
he
has
not
been
mother
did
not
wish
him
to
go
with
dudley
you
say
there
was
a
trace
of
severity
in
tones
thought
he
had
better
not
he
is
much
older
than
rex
do
you
know
whether
or
not
they
went
off
together
heard
dudley
say
something
about
having
invited
young
pell
to
go
to
new
haven
with
him
they
went
to
the
station
rex
must
have
gone
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
troubled
you
roy
now
made
a
little
bow
and
he
hurried
off
he
wanted
that
three
dollars
from
me
to
spend
on
the
trip
he
was
saying
to
himself
that
have
been
enough
he
must
have
used
the
money
he
said
he
was
saving
up
for
present
ah
reggie
i
think
it
of
you
when
he
told
the
news
at
home
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
concerning
what
ought
to
be
done
about
it
him
alone
suggested
jess
feels
bad
enough
about
it
by
this
i
know
when
he
will
be
back
said
pell
eva
suggested
that
they
write
him
a
letter
in
care
of
young
harrington
and
request
him
to
come
home
at
once
but
it
was
idea
that
was
acted
on
a
telegraphic
dispatch
was
sent
to
dudley
harrington
yale
new
haven
reginald
pell
with
you
it
ran
the
answer
came
duly
he
is
the
family
looked
at
one
another
consternation
depicted
in
their
faces
sydney
tried
to
comfort
them
by
explaining
that
doubtless
harrington
was
inclined
to
be
very
literal
under
the
circumstances
and
that
rex
was
not
with
him
because
he
had
just
started
for
home
but
pell
was
not
content
to
rest
under
this
uncertainty
another
message
was
sent
to
new
haven
reading
thus
reginald
pell
start
away
from
philadelphia
with
you
the
response
to
this
was
one
word
the
pells
were
now
really
alarmed
it
was
decided
that
sydney
should
start
the
first
thing
saturday
morning
for
new
haven
but
friday
night
he
was
seized
with
another
of
his
bad
turns
which
had
been
growing
more
and
more
frequent
of
late
roy
offered
to
go
in
his
place
and
pell
consented
to
the
substitution
so
roy
set
out
and
reached
new
haven
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
he
would
have
enjoyed
the
trip
if
his
mind
had
not
been
so
worried
about
rex
he
found
room
with
little
trouble
he
heard
the
notes
of
the
banjo
issuing
from
inside
he
had
to
knock
hard
before
he
could
make
himself
heard
there
were
three
fellows
there
two
of
them
in
the
luxuriously
cushioned
window
seat
roy
was
a
little
dazzled
by
the
unexpected
splendor
of
the
room
he
knew
harrington
of
course
the
fellow
in
the
blue
striped
blazer
he
went
up
to
the
collegian
at
once
guess
you
know
me
he
said
roy
pell
brother
i
came
up
to
find
out
what
you
could
tell
me
about
the
three
fellows
exchanged
glances
he
home
answered
harrington
when
did
he
leave
new
haven
been
to
new
haven
replied
harrington
slowly
been
here
exclaimed
roy
did
you
leave
him
then
new
he
going
home
know
and
harrington
looked
confused
as
he
made
this
unsatisfactory
answer
chapter
xxiii
a
telegram
roy
saw
at
a
glance
that
something
was
being
concealed
from
him
is
it
you
know
where
rex
went
when
he
left
you
he
inquired
i
see
which
way
he
went
when
he
left
the
hotel
answered
harrington
supposed
though
he
went
home
and
am
surprised
to
hear
he
there
atkins
here
may
be
able
to
tell
you
more
than
i
can
atkins
this
is
roy
pell
the
pleasantest
faced
fellow
in
the
room
came
forward
and
put
out
his
hand
glad
to
meet
you
pell
he
said
wish
i
could
give
you
some
definite
information
about
your
brother
i
thought
with
harri
here
that
he
was
certainly
at
he
glanced
over
at
the
other
two
who
were
softly
strumming
their
banjoes
in
the
window
seat
across
the
hall
into
my
room
he
added
day
harrington
called
out
roy
and
followed
atkins
he
could
see
that
harrington
was
relieved
to
have
him
go
tell
you
the
straight
of
it
pell
began
atkins
when
he
had
invited
his
visitor
to
make
himself
comfortable
in
one
of
the
many
lounging
chairs
with
which
the
apartment
abounded
see
harrington
brought
your
brother
to
one
of
the
time
jollifications
some
of
the
fellows
think
they
must
have
before
coming
up
here
i
was
there
i
care
about
going
very
much
but
my
room
mate
would
go
and
i
went
to
take
care
of
him
more
than
anything
else
all
the
fellows
except
your
brother
and
myself
were
more
than
half
seas
over
before
midnight
he
became
disgusted
and
got
out
i
was
busy
with
cheever
and
have
time
to
question
him
naturally
harrington
feels
a
little
sore
over
the
thing
but
he
any
idea
your
brother
gone
home
till
he
got
your
do
you
suppose
he
is
all
this
time
roy
was
terribly
anxious
the
whole
affair
was
much
worse
than
he
had
anticipated
he
was
glad
of
one
thing
though
that
rex
had
been
disgusted
with
the
orgy
wish
i
could
tell
you
answered
atkins
managed
to
get
cheever
over
to
our
house
before
morning
i
know
what
harrington
said
about
young
disappearance
when
he
came
to
did
reggie
want
to
go
with
such
fellows
for
groaned
roy
the
wonder
to
me
is
why
harrington
ever
took
him
up
there
must
be
at
least
five
difference
in
their
harri
appeared
to
be
quite
fond
of
him
i
guess
your
brother
flattered
him
some
dudley
can
stand
a
deal
of
i
must
find
rex
sure
he
money
enough
to
keep
him
all
this
while
and
i
know
where
to
look
wish
i
could
help
you
returned
atkins
tell
you
what
do
get
ready
now
and
go
down
to
new
york
with
you
you
can
come
to
our
house
and
stay
over
sunday
with
me
my
father
is
a
lawyer
he
may
be
able
to
tell
us
what
to
do
what
do
you
say
awfully
kind
returned
roy
i
like
to
be
intruding
the
pater
likes
me
to
bring
fellows
with
me
i
going
this
week
but
that
matter
be
glad
to
see
me
come
you
roy
thanked
him
again
and
accepted
he
liked
the
genial
hearted
fellow
as
much
as
rex
had
done
on
the
way
down
atkins
told
him
of
the
devices
for
disposing
of
the
punch
suppose
the
glass
he
drank
went
to
his
head
so
as
to
do
him
any
injury
do
you
asked
roy
atkins
reassured
him
on
this
point
and
then
suggested
that
they
had
better
go
to
the
hotel
where
the
jollification
had
been
held
to
see
if
any
trace
of
rex
could
be
obtained
there
but
the
clerk
informed
them
that
no
such
person
had
hired
a
room
that
evening
they
discussed
the
matter
with
judge
atkins
without
telling
the
details
of
the
jollification
which
doubtless
he
was
astute
enough
to
guess
at
the
result
was
that
messages
were
sent
to
all
the
police
precincts
and
a
detective
was
put
on
the
case
roy
sent
a
telegram
to
his
mother
saturday
night
making
it
as
hopeful
as
he
could
but
his
own
heart
was
growing
heavier
and
heavier
atkins
did
his
best
to
cheer
him
up
and
under
other
circumstances
roy
would
have
had
a
most
enjoyable
time
but
he
could
not
keep
his
thoughts
from
rex
he
went
home
on
monday
fearful
of
the
meeting
with
his
mother
he
felt
at
times
as
if
the
worst
news
if
it
might
be
but
definite
would
be
better
to
carry
home
than
those
tidings
he
must
take
which
would
keep
them
all
in
such
awful
suspense
sydney
had
recovered
but
the
shock
of
announcement
threw
him
back
into
a
relapse
and
yet
he
insisted
on
seeing
roy
money
has
not
made
us
happy
after
all
has
it
roy
he
said
after
the
sad
affair
had
been
talked
over
was
afraid
that
it
syd
still
this
might
have
happened
just
the
same
you
have
not
been
well
though
old
fellow
since
that
night
you
came
over
to
burdock
to
make
the
old
you
noticed
that
roy
said
sydney
quickly
it
seems
as
you
say
that
we
must
pay
up
for
having
the
money
in
some
way
but
where
can
poor
rex
be
i
wonder
if
he
is
ashamed
or
afraid
to
come
home
anxiously
the
reports
from
the
detectives
were
awaited
but
when
they
came
they
were
only
depressing
positively
no
trace
of
the
missing
boy
could
be
found
advertisements
were
inserted
in
the
new
york
and
philadelphia
papers
but
nothing
came
of
them
the
family
were
by
this
time
well
nigh
distracted
they
had
not
even
the
poor
satisfaction
of
mourning
the
lost
as
one
dead
they
could
only
wait
and
hope
but
as
the
days
passed
into
a
week
this
last
seemed
futile
the
time
came
for
school
to
open
but
roy
had
little
heart
to
go
alone
still
he
must
attend
to
his
education
the
first
week
of
it
dragged
slowly
by
some
of
his
marley
friends
wanted
him
to
come
down
there
and
spend
his
saturday
he
had
not
yet
decided
friday
night
whether
he
wanted
to
go
when
the
door
bell
rang
and
a
messenger
appeared
with
a
telegram
for
roy
pell
it
was
dated
at
some
town
in
jersey
of
which
he
had
never
heard
and
was
very
brief
but
the
one
word
signed
to
it
was
worth
a
hundred
lines
for
that
name
was
safe
will
write
that
was
all
and
when
he
read
it
to
the
family
the
wild
exclamations
of
joy
were
succeeded
by
perplexed
impatience
he
tell
us
where
to
find
him
eva
wanted
to
know
he
send
word
to
mother
added
jess
does
he
not
explain
his
long
silence
said
fell
fearing
the
worst
sydney
was
away
at
harrisburg
and
roy
decided
that
instead
of
going
to
marley
the
following
day
he
would
find
out
where
this
new
jersey
town
was
and
hunt
up
rex
at
once
pell
wanted
to
go
with
him
but
roy
reminded
her
that
he
might
have
considerable
difficulty
in
tracing
rex
so
it
was
decided
that
she
wait
until
she
heard
from
him
from
a
railroad
time
table
roy
ascertained
where
he
must
go
and
by
the
first
train
he
could
get
in
the
morning
he
set
out
very
gentle
with
him
roy
his
mother
said
at
parting
his
sending
to
you
he
evidently
thinks
i
am
greatly
displeased
with
me
mother
roy
assured
her
with
a
smile
he
felt
very
happy
this
morning
happier
than
he
had
it
seemed
to
him
since
they
had
come
into
their
fortune
of
such
worth
is
sorrow
sometimes
to
make
a
contrast
by
which
to
intensify
joy
on
arriving
at
his
destination
he
went
to
the
man
in
the
ticket
office
and
put
the
following
inquiry
you
know
anybody
in
the
place
named
reginald
pell
was
the
reply
he
lived
here
long
he
really
live
here
my
twin
brother
you
see
and
i
have
a
telegram
from
him
but
he
say
where
he
was
staying
is
this
a
very
big
place
the
ticket
agent
smiled
it
exactly
a
metropolis
he
said
you
responded
roy
and
he
walked
out
of
the
rear
door
toward
the
dusty
road
thinking
he
was
not
going
to
have
such
an
easy
job
to
find
rex
after
all
if
he
was
in
the
town
where
he
was
supposed
to
be
the
station
was
built
at
a
little
distance
from
the
town
proper
roy
walked
on
along
a
board
walk
until
he
came
to
the
first
house
one
of
those
white
green
shuttered
affairs
whose
number
is
legion
in
the
rural
districts
a
woman
without
a
hat
on
was
sweeping
the
leaves
from
the
path
that
led
down
to
the
gate
the
lines
about
her
mouth
were
rather
stern
but
roy
made
up
his
mind
to
begin
with
her
chapter
xxiv
found
at
last
me
began
roy
leaning
over
the
gate
and
taking
off
his
broad
brimmed
straw
hat
you
know
a
boy
named
rex
pell
he
had
decided
that
this
would
be
the
shortest
way
of
getting
at
things
the
woman
looked
up
quickly
resting
her
chin
on
the
top
of
her
broom
handle
you
think
i
look
as
if
i
knew
much
about
boys
she
replied
i
and
i
want
me
said
roy
and
he
hurried
on
glad
to
get
away
the
next
house
was
a
larger
one
there
was
a
good
deal
of
piazza
around
it
and
some
pretensions
were
made
at
keeping
the
lawn
in
good
condition
knock
at
the
door
was
answered
so
promptly
that
he
was
fain
to
believe
that
some
one
must
have
been
peeping
through
the
shutters
watching
his
approach
a
tall
woman
with
light
hair
received
him
very
effusively
been
expecting
you
she
said
with
an
expansive
smile
thought
come
on
that
must
be
the
place
thought
roy
knows
rex
sent
the
dispatch
and
thought
some
of
us
would
come
suppose
like
to
go
straight
up
stairs
she
continued
when
she
had
taken
his
hat
and
hung
it
on
the
stand
in
the
hall
i
would
and
heart
sank
rex
must
be
sick
he
decided
and
not
able
to
leave
his
bed
he
followed
the
light
haired
woman
to
the
floor
above
where
she
threw
open
the
door
of
a
room
with
a
sort
of
flourish
roy
halted
on
the
threshold
there
was
a
double
bed
inside
but
nobody
on
it
nor
was
anybody
to
be
seen
in
the
apartment
is
my
brother
he
asked
brother
exclaimed
the
woman
did
not
understand
that
there
were
two
of
you
your
letter
mentioned
only
one
son
wait
i
will
there
must
be
some
mistake
roy
interposed
thought
my
brother
rex
pell
might
be
you
are
not
eric
levens
then
indeed
and
you
know
anything
about
my
brother
i
am
so
thought
you
were
the
young
gentleman
i
expected
who
was
to
look
at
this
room
to
see
whether
he
liked
it
well
enough
to
stay
while
his
father
went
to
europe
but
why
are
you
sorry
that
i
do
not
know
anything
about
your
brother
have
you
lost
him
a
sort
of
a
way
yes
and
roy
told
his
story
or
as
much
of
it
as
he
could
without
bringing
in
the
fact
of
having
run
away
from
home
i
guess
i
can
help
you
exclaimed
the
woman
when
he
had
finished
he
is
the
young
fellow
who
is
staying
at
the
i
heard
about
it
last
sunday
at
about
what
face
grew
pale
the
woman
looked
a
little
uncomfortable
be
too
anxious
she
replied
must
be
better
now
if
he
could
send
a
message
but
had
the
intermittent
fever
he
was
found
on
the
piazza
of
the
house
one
rainy
evening
about
ten
days
ago
by
florence
raynor
a
trampish
looking
young
fellow
had
carried
him
in
out
of
the
wet
and
they
say
been
devoted
to
him
ever
do
the
raynors
live
asked
roy
already
impatient
to
be
off
here
to
the
window
and
i
can
show
you
the
house
it
is
clear
at
the
end
of
this
street
beyond
all
the
others
you
can
just
see
the
chimneys
above
the
roy
was
soon
hurrying
away
in
the
direction
pointed
out
although
he
feared
that
rex
might
have
been
ill
the
certainty
of
it
made
his
heart
very
sore
for
his
brother
among
strangers
was
his
thought
wish
mother
had
come
with
a
young
girl
was
reading
on
the
piazza
when
he
opened
the
gate
and
walked
up
the
path
between
the
box
hedges
my
brother
rex
here
he
said
pausing
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
his
hat
in
his
hand
she
had
raised
her
head
as
the
gate
latch
clicked
and
now
their
eyes
met
even
in
that
moment
roy
noted
how
very
pretty
she
was
are
the
roy
that
he
sent
the
telegram
to
she
exclaimed
then
paused
suddenly
and
blushed
roy
and
had
a
hard
time
to
find
him
how
is
he
better
he
was
asleep
just
now
if
you
will
come
in
i
will
call
has
certainly
fallen
into
good
hands
thought
roy
when
he
was
left
alone
raynor
came
out
in
a
moment
and
greeted
roy
most
cordially
glad
you
came
she
said
will
do
your
brother
good
to
see
you
been
very
very
kind
to
him
answered
roy
it
any
trouble
because
we
all
took
to
him
so
it
was
a
pleasure
to
do
for
why
he
let
us
know
before
where
he
was
asked
roy
you
he
only
knew
himself
yesterday
had
a
hard
tug
of
it
and
not
a
scrap
or
a
card
could
we
find
about
him
only
the
letters
p
on
his
been
out
of
his
head
and
you
must
be
prepared
to
find
him
greatly
changed
but
come
around
again
all
right
the
doctor
says
go
up
now
and
see
if
he
is
awake
and
call
the
summons
to
ascend
came
a
few
minutes
later
and
presently
roy
found
himself
standing
by
his
bedside
raynor
considerately
withdrew
and
left
the
two
together
warning
them
that
she
should
be
back
in
ten
minutes
to
prevent
her
patient
from
becoming
unduly
excited
rex
had
changed
there
was
no
longer
any
plumpness
in
his
cheeks
and
his
face
was
very
white
but
so
were
his
teeth
and
his
eyes
were
as
lustrous
as
ever
he
uttered
the
one
word
in
a
weak
voice
and
held
tightly
in
both
of
his
the
hands
that
his
brother
extended
to
him
a
moment
of
the
precious
ten
was
lost
to
silence
as
the
two
looked
at
each
other
but
in
that
look
was
that
which
hours
of
speech
could
not
have
expressed
roy
read
in
it
true
repentance
a
pleading
for
forgiveness
and
rex
saw
that
there
was
no
chiding
for
him
from
those
at
home
only
love
and
pity
you
know
all
roy
the
very
worst
rex
then
whispered
think
of
that
now
reggie
it
is
all
right
i
want
to
talk
about
i
must
think
of
it
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
ever
since
i
came
to
my
senses
yesterday
did
you
know
that
i
told
you
lies
that
i
acted
them
that
i
took
the
money
i
had
been
saving
up
for
present
to
pay
the
expenses
of
this
wretched
trip
you
go
all
the
way
reggie
i
found
that
out
you
turned
back
what
happened
to
you
then
rex
told
the
terrible
tale
of
the
robbery
of
the
awful
night
he
had
passed
riding
back
and
forth
across
the
river
and
had
got
as
far
as
his
falling
asleep
on
the
train
when
raynor
appeared
and
smilingly
announced
that
time
was
up
will
tell
you
the
rest
roy
said
rex
the
best
fellow
i
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
if
it
been
for
him
and
raynor
too
when
i
get
well
they
must
all
come
to
philadelphia
and
give
them
the
very
best
there
was
a
touch
of
his
old
self
in
the
heartiness
with
which
he
uttered
these
words
coming
and
comforting
words
had
lifted
a
heavy
burden
from
his
heart
they
left
him
to
try
to
get
to
sleep
again
roy
went
down
stairs
with
raynor
ought
to
go
home
at
once
and
tell
my
mother
about
rex
he
said
not
send
a
message
and
stay
with
him
suggested
the
other
should
be
very
glad
to
have
you
there
is
plenty
of
room
in
the
house
or
send
word
for
your
mother
to
come
on
i
know
she
must
be
anxious
to
see
her
roy
hesitated
he
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
then
he
remembered
absence
and
reflected
that
the
girls
could
not
very
well
be
left
alone
he
decided
to
stay
himself
till
monday
and
to
send
word
that
rex
was
all
right
now
he
hurried
off
to
the
station
to
write
his
dispatch
and
came
back
as
quickly
to
the
he
recollected
that
he
had
not
yet
seen
the
miles
of
whom
rex
spoke
the
fellow
who
could
tell
him
the
continuation
of
his
adventures
he
asked
florence
whom
he
found
on
the
lawn
where
he
could
find
miles
out
in
the
field
now
she
replied
potatoes
but
almost
twelve
be
in
then
for
his
dinner
he
just
adores
that
brother
of
who
is
he
roy
persisted
he
told
us
his
story
yet
we
took
him
on
trust
and
turned
out
all
right
so
far
but
there
he
comes
me
said
roy
go
and
see
and
he
hurried
off
around
the
corner
of
the
house
the
next
minute
he
stood
face
to
face
with
the
youth
who
is
destined
to
play
a
highly
important
part
in
the
remainder
of
this
tale
chapter
xxv
miles
story
miles
knew
roy
at
once
is
miles
it
said
roy
in
his
pleasant
way
and
he
put
out
his
hand
but
wait
a
miles
hurried
to
the
pump
near
the
kitchen
door
he
gave
his
hands
a
douse
of
water
dried
them
quickly
on
a
roller
towel
in
the
woodshed
and
then
came
back
to
greet
the
brother
of
the
boy
of
whom
he
was
so
fond
got
the
telegram
all
right
then
he
said
was
so
weak
when
he
told
me
where
to
send
it
i
sure
get
it
quite
want
to
thank
you
for
all
you
did
for
him
went
on
roy
told
me
about
it
except
the
details
he
said
do
what
happened
to
him
after
he
got
out
of
the
train
but
let
me
keep
you
from
your
rather
talk
to
you
than
eat
said
miles
frankly
raynor
appeared
at
this
moment
and
compromised
matters
by
bringing
dinner
to
him
out
on
the
side
porch
roy
sat
by
and
listened
to
the
recital
most
modestly
given
of
the
facts
with
which
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
it
was
time
for
miles
to
return
to
his
work
when
it
was
finished
and
florence
came
to
summon
roy
to
their
own
dinner
he
queer
she
said
referring
to
miles
seems
so
quiet
and
talks
so
well
for
a
man
who
a
tramp
i
know
what
else
you
could
call
him
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
clothes
he
had
on
when
he
first
came
mamma
made
him
burn
looks
as
if
he
might
have
an
interesting
story
to
tell
commented
roy
get
him
to
tell
it
if
your
brother
is
well
enough
said
raynor
promised
that
we
should
hear
it
as
soon
as
rex
was
able
to
listen
roy
took
dinner
up
to
him
and
the
twins
had
an
hour
to
themselves
during
which
rex
went
more
into
detail
concerning
his
experiences
with
harrington
and
his
crowd
they
compared
notes
on
harry
atkins
and
then
fell
to
talking
of
miles
harding
something
more
than
a
common
tramp
rex
insisted
can
read
a
little
and
write
some
it
funny
how
much
he
thinks
of
me
when
i
done
a
thing
for
him
raynor
lets
him
come
up
and
sit
with
me
every
evening
when
his
work
is
done
of
course
i
know
this
till
yesterday
when
i
came
to
my
after
the
visit
about
three
rex
went
to
sleep
and
roy
played
a
game
of
tennis
with
florence
want
to
seem
glad
that
your
brother
is
sick
she
said
awfully
nice
to
have
company
i
get
so
lonely
when
bert
is
that
evening
they
all
assembled
in
raynor
was
a
widow
so
the
family
at
home
consisted
only
of
herself
and
miles
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
told
the
story
of
his
life
know
where
i
was
born
he
began
first
thing
i
can
remember
is
living
in
a
tenement
house
in
new
york
where
i
had
to
sleep
three
in
a
bed
with
the
two
morrisey
boys
morrisey
was
a
truckman
and
there
was
five
children
of
them
and
i
made
six
i
always
thought
i
was
a
morrisey
too
till
one
day
jimmy
he
got
mad
at
me
and
told
me
i
talk
so
big
because
i
was
only
living
on
charity
went
to
his
mother
and
asked
her
about
it
and
she
told
me
that
it
was
true
that
i
really
her
child
but
that
she
thought
as
much
of
me
as
if
i
was
and
that
there
any
charity
about
it
but
i
wanted
to
know
all
about
myself
and
at
last
she
said
that
been
given
to
morrisey
when
i
was
a
wee
baby
by
a
friend
of
his
who
afford
to
keep
me
and
who
made
him
vow
that
never
tell
where
i
came
from
only
found
it
out
by
accident
one
night
listening
to
his
father
and
mother
talking
when
they
thought
he
was
asleep
she
said
i
to
feel
bad
about
it
because
they
thought
everything
of
me
i
did
feel
bad
about
it
it
seemed
too
hard
when
the
morriseys
had
all
they
could
do
to
get
along
they
should
have
one
more
that
not
a
morrisey
feed
studied
as
hard
as
i
could
at
school
so
as
to
try
and
get
through
sooner
and
go
to
work
and
begin
to
pay
them
back
but
when
i
was
twelve
morrisey
was
kicked
to
death
by
a
horse
and
the
next
year
morrisey
married
a
man
who
took
her
and
the
children
out
to
dakota
to
live
wanted
me
to
go
along
but
i
knew
rollings
like
me
and
besides
i
wanted
to
stay
east
where
there
was
some
chance
of
my
finding
out
who
my
parents
were
i
got
a
place
as
cash
boy
in
a
japanese
store
and
boarded
with
some
people
who
lived
across
the
hall
from
where
the
morriseys
had
their
rooms
benton
used
to
get
drunk
and
when
he
was
that
way
beat
me
just
for
the
fun
of
it
it
seemed
to
me
then
when
they
cut
down
the
number
of
boys
employed
in
the
store
and
i
find
another
place
right
away
he
growled
so
about
my
not
paying
my
board
that
i
did
my
things
up
in
a
bundle
one
night
and
hid
myself
on
a
canal
boat
down
at
the
east
river
docks
captain
was
awful
mad
when
he
found
me
after
we
had
got
clear
up
the
north
river
he
gave
me
a
good
thrashing
and
then
said
he
was
going
to
drop
me
overboard
but
he
and
i
stayed
on
board
all
that
season
driving
mules
and
being
sworn
at
and
kicked
and
trounced
like
any
other
boy
on
the
canal
i
sometimes
wonder
why
i
wear
out
navigation
closed
i
was
set
adrift
and
had
a
hard
scrub
of
it
to
get
along
for
a
time
i
almost
starved
for
a
while
in
albany
trying
to
pick
up
odd
jobs
then
i
came
near
freezing
to
death
i
got
a
place
as
errand
boy
in
a
grocery
store
and
kept
that
till
some
money
was
missing
and
they
said
i
took
it
i
never
stole
in
my
life
morrisey
brought
me
up
too
well
for
me
to
do
that
but
i
prove
i
and
i
had
to
go
the
man
said
i
ought
to
consider
myself
lucky
i
sent
to
jail
that
i
had
a
worse
time
of
it
than
ever
whenever
i
applied
for
a
position
they
wanted
to
know
why
i
had
left
my
last
place
and
when
i
told
them
they
have
anything
to
do
with
me
came
the
days
when
sometimes
i
thought
i
might
as
well
steal
i
was
suffering
because
i
was
accused
of
doing
it
when
i
was
very
hungry
and
saw
chances
of
sneaking
apples
out
of
barrels
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
almost
a
right
to
do
it
but
i
never
did
always
turned
up
to
keep
me
from
starving
once
a
woman
stopped
me
in
the
street
and
gave
me
a
dollar
she
said
i
looked
so
hungry
she
go
by
me
without
doing
it
time
i
was
taken
sick
in
one
of
the
parks
something
like
rex
i
fell
down
in
a
kind
of
faint
and
when
i
came
to
i
was
in
a
hospital
and
i
stayed
there
quite
a
little
while
i
got
out
it
was
spring
and
i
thought
try
the
country
i
beg
only
asked
for
work
sometimes
i
got
it
many
more
times
i
and
then
if
they
give
me
work
offer
me
milk
or
a
cup
of
coffee
so
i
managed
to
pull
through
somehow
last
i
got
back
to
new
york
been
wanting
to
get
there
again
ever
since
the
thought
came
to
me
one
day
that
perhaps
some
friends
of
might
know
something
about
the
man
who
had
given
me
to
him
when
i
was
a
baby
a
good
deal
of
trouble
i
found
one
of
them
he
was
a
bricklayer
and
he
told
me
as
near
as
he
could
remember
the
man
who
gave
me
to
tim
morrisey
was
from
philadelphia
and
all
he
knew
i
wanted
to
go
to
philadelphia
what
good
will
that
do
you
miles
beesley
asked
find
out
any
more
there
nor
as
much
as
you
can
i
told
him
if
there
maybe
somebody
find
out
something
from
passing
me
in
the
an
idea
sure
enough
he
said
so
i
started
for
philadelphia
and
how
i
came
to
fall
in
with
miles
finished
his
story
with
this
word
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
had
done
it
on
purpose
planning
for
it
as
it
were
he
always
spoke
the
name
with
a
little
pause
before
it
as
if
it
were
something
sacred
rex
had
told
him
to
call
him
by
it
the
day
before
when
he
had
started
in
to
address
him
as
all
of
striving
after
premature
manhood
had
been
left
in
that
past
which
preceded
his
experiences
in
the
hotel
at
new
york
chapter
xxvi
in
winter
days
story
had
been
listened
to
with
the
closest
attention
by
all
the
little
party
just
like
a
chapter
out
of
a
book
florence
whispered
to
roy
wonder
if
ever
find
out
who
he
really
is
how
did
you
come
by
the
name
harding
roy
inquired
you
miles
morrisey
once
but
when
they
went
away
and
i
got
to
having
such
hard
knocks
from
the
world
i
want
to
drag
the
name
down
with
me
and
so
i
thought
harding
would
suit
me
pretty
well
and
took
rex
seemed
inclined
to
grow
excited
over
the
theme
so
raynor
proposed
an
immediate
adjournment
is
sunday
she
said
miles
can
have
a
long
day
with
in
the
course
of
this
long
day
the
wanderer
told
roy
why
he
had
been
so
drawn
to
rex
seen
lots
of
nice
looking
fellows
like
him
he
said
they
always
looked
down
on
me
and
kind
of
kept
off
as
if
they
want
me
to
touch
them
with
my
dirty
clothes
but
i
had
to
touch
rex
when
he
fell
over
and
he
seem
to
mind
rex
flushed
when
roy
told
him
this
afraid
i
seem
to
mind
because
i
was
too
far
gone
to
mind
anything
he
said
i
do
like
miles
and
would
like
to
do
all
i
can
for
roy
returned
home
monday
morning
and
pell
went
out
to
rex
that
night
he
improved
rapidly
and
within
a
fortnight
was
able
to
be
moved
to
philadelphia
it
was
pitiable
to
see
the
effect
of
the
parting
on
miles
the
raynors
had
found
him
very
capable
and
were
anxious
to
keep
him
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
stay
except
his
desire
to
be
where
rex
was
and
his
quixotic
notion
that
he
might
meet
his
father
or
mother
should
he
go
to
philadelphia
a
look
out
for
me
rex
he
said
if
you
hear
of
any
position
you
think
i
could
fill
let
me
rex
promised
and
after
he
got
home
told
his
mother
that
when
she
could
make
up
her
mind
to
completely
forgive
him
for
all
he
had
done
he
wished
that
she
would
think
of
something
they
could
do
for
miles
have
forgiven
you
already
reggie
was
the
reply
know
that
you
have
suffered
enough
not
to
need
any
other
lesson
now
why
not
make
miles
a
present
of
a
complete
outfit
he
take
it
all
right
then
when
he
is
properly
fitted
out
you
can
invite
him
on
here
for
thanksgiving
rex
talked
over
the
idea
with
roy
and
then
they
wrote
to
raynor
about
it
the
end
of
the
matter
was
that
they
procured
measure
and
sent
him
the
things
as
a
present
from
rex
the
invitation
for
thanksgiving
was
in
the
letter
that
accompanied
them
the
young
gratitude
was
beyond
the
power
of
expression
and
over
and
over
again
he
asked
raynor
if
she
thought
it
was
right
for
him
to
accept
the
invitation
course
it
is
right
she
told
him
would
not
have
asked
you
if
they
had
not
wanted
his
happiness
seemed
to
shine
out
of
every
feature
of
his
face
when
he
boarded
the
philadelphia
train
wednesday
afternoon
rex
met
him
at
the
station
and
was
surprised
to
see
what
a
good
looking
fellow
he
made
when
he
was
properly
rigged
out
make
some
awful
blunders
miles
confided
to
him
on
the
way
to
the
house
never
been
with
swell
folks
not
swell
rex
laughed
he
had
half
a
mind
to
let
him
know
then
and
there
where
they
got
their
money
but
decided
that
he
that
night
he
took
his
guest
to
the
theater
and
the
next
day
sydney
had
a
long
talk
with
him
his
manners
were
much
easier
among
the
unaccustomed
surroundings
than
rex
had
dared
to
hope
they
would
be
pell
was
very
much
attracted
by
him
and
both
girls
declared
he
was
in
his
talk
with
him
sydney
sought
to
draw
out
all
the
facts
he
could
about
the
morriseys
boy
you
had
the
fight
with
miles
he
i
think
you
told
rex
his
name
you
never
ask
him
any
questions
about
what
he
overheard
that
night
morrisey
seemed
not
to
want
me
to
talk
about
it
and
besides
i
never
would
have
asked
jimmy
after
what
had
ask
him
now
you
went
on
sydney
say
that
you
heard
his
mother
was
dead
he
seems
to
be
the
only
person
left
from
whom
you
can
get
a
ask
him
now
if
i
had
the
chance
miles
admitted
i
know
just
where
he
is
you
see
lost
track
of
the
morriseys
you
could
find
it
again
you
write
to
the
place
where
you
heard
they
were
last
where
was
that
good
do
that
and
when
you
have
found
out
all
you
can
from
jimmy
let
me
miles
promised
to
attend
to
this
but
since
he
had
fallen
in
with
rex
his
desire
to
hunt
up
his
parents
seemed
not
as
strong
as
it
had
been
he
went
back
to
the
raynors
enthusiastic
over
his
visit
and
talked
of
it
for
weeks
afterward
meanwhile
roy
and
rex
settled
down
to
their
school
life
the
change
made
in
rex
by
his
new
york
experience
was
quite
noticeable
while
retaining
all
his
dignity
of
manner
he
was
more
thoughtful
of
the
feelings
of
others
than
he
had
been
he
worried
a
good
deal
at
first
about
the
opinion
scott
bowman
must
have
of
him
and
truth
to
tell
scott
did
feel
a
little
sore
over
the
way
he
had
been
treated
the
two
boys
did
not
write
or
see
each
other
till
they
met
accidentally
in
the
street
at
christmas
time
rex
saw
scott
coming
and
grew
red
in
spite
of
himself
there
was
a
chance
he
felt
that
the
other
might
go
by
without
speaking
to
him
but
scott
halted
and
put
out
his
hand
rex
he
said
a
and
at
these
words
a
great
burden
was
lifted
from
mind
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
it
was
very
difficult
to
keep
at
odds
with
a
fellow
with
the
fascinating
personality
of
rex
pell
and
now
since
the
recent
change
in
him
he
was
more
attractive
than
ever
he
took
scott
home
to
lunch
with
him
and
related
in
detail
his
adventures
on
his
memorable
trip
the
fun
in
being
comes
in
he
concluded
at
christmas
time
pell
had
raynor
and
florence
in
for
a
visit
miles
heard
from
jimmy
morrisey
yet
rex
inquired
florence
replied
write
till
about
three
weeks
let
him
come
in
and
see
us
new
you
rex
went
on
indeed
if
you
would
like
to
have
miles
came
for
new
and
brought
the
information
that
he
had
heard
from
jimmy
morrisey
at
last
he
was
a
hall
boy
in
a
new
york
hotel
and
said
that
as
near
as
he
could
remember
the
name
he
had
heard
his
father
mention
that
night
in
his
talk
with
his
mother
was
darley
rex
wrote
the
name
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
put
it
away
to
show
to
sydney
on
his
return
from
his
florida
trip
for
his
health
had
been
growing
steadily
poorer
and
pell
had
persuaded
him
finally
to
go
south
with
a
friend
for
a
while
know
he
really
my
own
brother
rex
confided
to
miles
a
distant
relative
his
father
and
mother
died
when
he
was
very
miles
was
much
interested
on
hearing
this
it
served
in
some
way
to
establish
another
bond
between
himself
and
the
pells
let
you
know
what
syd
finds
out
about
this
as
soon
as
he
finds
out
anything
rex
told
miles
at
parting
miles
had
begun
to
attend
school
he
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
study
since
leaving
the
morriseys
he
was
naturally
quick
and
made
good
progress
know
too
much
by
spring
to
be
put
to
garden
work
again
raynor
had
said
when
she
was
in
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
him
worry
about
that
laughed
jess
that
time
he
may
have
found
his
parents
and
be
a
you
talk
jess
interposed
her
sister
he
ever
does
find
his
people
it
follow
that
they
will
be
wealthy
indeed
probably
never
have
been
given
to
the
morriseys
if
his
father
been
too
poor
to
support
eva
took
a
deep
interest
in
the
case
she
was
of
a
literary
turn
of
mind
and
wove
many
a
romance
in
her
busy
brain
about
the
early
history
of
this
strange
youth
who
seemed
so
extraordinarily
gentle
considering
his
rough
bringing
up
sydney
came
home
just
before
the
vacation
ended
syd
rex
suddenly
exclaimed
that
first
evening
as
they
were
all
seated
in
the
library
listening
to
florida
experiences
has
heard
from
this
morrisey
replied
sydney
he
learn
anything
of
importance
he
found
out
the
name
his
father
and
mother
used
when
they
were
talking
about
the
man
who
brought
miles
to
what
was
it
sydney
fell
back
in
his
chair
and
grew
as
white
as
a
ghost
chapter
xxvii
sydney
goes
on
a
mysterious
expedition
the
family
were
greatly
alarmed
at
collapse
pell
had
fondly
hoped
that
his
southern
trip
would
be
of
permanent
benefit
to
him
and
here
he
was
breaking
down
on
the
first
night
of
his
return
not
one
of
them
associated
his
seizure
in
any
way
with
the
subject
on
which
they
had
been
talking
except
rex
he
could
not
but
recall
a
somewhat
similar
attack
when
sydney
had
fainted
in
his
office
while
he
rex
was
telling
scott
bowman
of
their
inheritance
but
miles
affairs
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
what
did
it
all
mean
rex
asked
himself
as
he
sped
off
for
the
doctor
when
he
got
back
sydney
had
come
to
but
seemed
to
be
suffering
severely
and
yet
when
asked
if
he
was
in
pain
he
would
shake
his
head
and
beg
so
imploringly
that
they
would
leave
him
to
himself
that
the
fears
of
the
family
were
intensified
many
fold
the
doctor
was
utterly
nonplused
he
prescribed
a
quieting
potion
and
went
away
promising
to
return
again
in
the
morning
perhaps
you
had
better
humor
him
in
his
desire
to
be
left
alone
he
said
to
pell
of
course
arrange
to
be
near
in
case
another
collapse
the
household
separated
for
bed
that
night
with
sober
faces
been
like
himself
since
tyler
died
remarked
roy
lingering
at
the
door
of
room
rex
did
not
reply
immediately
he
stood
looking
at
his
brother
intently
for
an
instant
then
he
put
a
hand
on
shoulder
gently
pulled
him
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
down
a
minute
roy
he
said
gravely
want
to
tell
you
is
it
what
makes
you
look
so
solemn
reggie
is
it
anything
about
syd
about
syd
something
that
happened
last
summer
and
which
he
told
me
not
to
tell
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
ought
to
tell
in
a
few
words
then
rex
related
what
he
and
scott
bowman
had
witnessed
adding
an
account
of
what
sydney
had
said
to
him
when
he
asked
to
have
the
doctor
sent
out
of
the
room
queer
it
roy
rex
added
but
i
connect
it
with
the
present
can
i
that
makes
it
queerer
still
perhaps
better
not
say
anything
about
what
i
told
i
and
the
boys
sat
quiet
a
while
longer
discussing
the
mystery
of
this
affair
in
lowered
tones
meanwhile
sydney
in
his
room
across
the
hall
was
lying
in
his
bed
with
his
eyes
wide
open
staring
at
the
ceiling
now
and
then
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
on
which
the
perspiration
kept
gathering
is
nemesis
he
murmured
over
and
over
have
felt
that
it
would
come
and
now
at
last
it
has
appeared
and
through
rex
of
all
the
others
all
through
that
night
he
remained
thus
wakeful
he
watched
helplessly
the
gradual
breaking
of
the
dawn
knowing
that
he
had
not
slept
a
moment
and
feeling
that
he
must
have
this
physical
ill
to
bear
in
addition
to
the
mental
one
which
already
weighed
him
down
to
the
earth
but
he
had
come
to
the
turning
point
now
in
some
way
this
was
a
relief
even
though
the
prospect
immediately
ahead
of
him
was
such
a
fearsome
one
he
wished
that
he
could
go
up
to
the
office
without
seeing
any
of
the
family
as
he
had
done
that
other
morning
in
marley
but
he
could
not
do
this
now
they
would
worry
and
send
after
him
he
must
try
and
get
through
the
ordeal
of
facing
them
as
best
he
could
he
rose
at
the
usual
time
but
before
he
had
finished
dressing
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
voice
wanting
to
know
how
he
was
right
he
replied
and
then
as
his
brother
asked
if
he
might
come
in
he
opened
the
door
right
exclaimed
roy
after
one
look
at
his
face
syd
only
because
i
slept
sydney
hastened
to
assure
him
what
are
you
getting
up
for
roy
went
on
must
go
down
town
i
have
that
to
do
which
will
ease
my
mind
and
me
all
right
again
i
the
last
words
were
added
in
so
low
a
tone
as
to
be
scarcely
audible
syd
what
is
it
what
is
worrying
you
i
help
you
in
any
way
roy
you
can
not
now
will
your
oh
syd
you
do
not
know
what
you
roy
i
have
a
hard
task
to
perform
do
not
i
beg
of
you
make
it
roy
said
no
more
he
would
not
after
this
he
went
back
to
his
own
room
and
went
over
in
his
mind
all
that
had
befallen
them
since
they
had
been
what
the
world
called
wealthy
one
bit
happier
though
no
not
as
happy
he
added
for
himself
at
the
breakfast
table
sydney
insisted
that
he
felt
plenty
well
enough
to
go
to
the
office
you
see
mother
he
said
at
last
it
is
a
matter
of
the
mind
and
not
of
the
body
let
me
have
the
opportunity
of
easing
that
will
see
the
but
when
he
left
the
house
he
did
not
go
at
once
to
his
office
he
stopped
at
the
first
drug
store
he
passed
and
walked
up
to
the
little
stand
on
which
the
city
directory
was
kept
he
turned
the
pages
to
d
and
then
looked
up
darley
there
were
several
of
the
name
and
a
frown
contracted
his
brow
but
he
took
out
his
pencil
and
memorandum
book
and
made
a
note
of
the
various
addresses
then
he
went
on
but
soon
turned
into
a
street
that
would
not
take
him
to
the
office
he
boarded
a
car
and
rode
off
in
the
direction
of
south
street
in
the
course
of
twenty
minutes
he
was
waiting
for
his
ring
to
be
answered
at
the
door
of
a
very
modest
little
house
near
the
baltimore
tracks
but
after
he
had
been
admitted
he
did
not
remain
long
inside
must
try
another
he
muttered
consulting
his
memorandum
he
tried
several
others
but
with
equal
ill
success
the
quest
seemed
hopeless
may
be
nothing
in
it
after
all
he
murmured
that
does
not
lighten
my
load
here
and
he
pressed
his
hand
over
his
heart
all
that
day
he
kept
up
his
hunt
scarcely
stopping
to
get
a
little
lunch
at
noon
toward
nightfall
he
called
at
an
address
on
seventh
street
next
to
the
last
on
his
list
it
was
an
odd
looking
a
store
for
there
was
a
regular
shop
window
but
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
curtains
that
screened
off
the
interior
and
no
sign
and
the
door
when
he
tried
it
was
locked
but
there
was
a
bell
handle
close
beside
it
and
this
he
pulled
the
door
was
opened
after
quite
an
interval
to
a
mere
crack
and
the
voice
of
an
aged
woman
wanted
to
know
who
was
there
gentleman
to
see
david
darley
sydney
answered
see
him
came
back
the
reply
been
dead
these
five
then
went
on
sydney
pushing
against
the
door
to
prevent
any
possibility
of
its
being
shut
in
his
face
want
to
see
some
of
his
wife
or
daughter
or
any
of
them
either
was
the
reply
only
then
like
to
see
you
sydney
rejoined
feeling
that
this
too
was
to
be
a
wild
goose
chase
but
determined
nevertheless
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
do
you
want
to
see
me
about
went
on
the
old
lady
know
just
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
about
darley
are
you
any
relation
of
his
his
and
the
door
was
slowly
opened
but
only
wide
enough
to
admit
sydney
when
it
was
closed
behind
him
with
great
rapidity
he
looked
with
some
curiosity
at
the
person
who
admitted
him
she
was
very
small
not
much
above
his
waist
in
height
and
quite
old
with
snow
white
hair
and
a
very
peaceful
expression
of
face
that
contrasted
markedly
with
her
evident
fear
of
strangers
she
did
not
ask
sydney
to
be
seated
and
remained
standing
herself
taking
up
her
station
in
the
doorway
that
led
into
the
room
beyond
as
if
seeking
to
bar
out
any
intrusion
there
the
apartment
in
which
sydney
found
himself
was
a
very
pleasant
one
well
lighted
from
the
large
window
whose
upper
portion
was
undraped
there
were
some
pictures
on
the
walls
a
piano
stood
at
one
side
and
a
guitar
could
be
seen
off
in
one
corner
but
sydney
was
not
in
the
mood
to
take
many
notes
of
his
surroundings
he
proceeded
at
once
with
the
business
in
hand
david
darley
any
relation
to
maurice
darley
he
inquired
it
hurt
david
if
i
answer
replied
the
old
lady
cautiously
can
it
since
you
say
he
is
dead
sydney
responded
with
the
flicker
of
a
smile
then
answered
the
other
heaving
a
little
sigh
see
as
it
can
do
any
harm
for
me
to
say
that
david
was
his
last
burst
forth
sydney
with
something
between
a
shout
and
a
groan
he
put
his
hand
against
the
wall
as
if
to
steady
himself

the
strange

of
fox
all
the
suspicions
of
the
little
white
haired
old
lady
seemed
to
be
revived
by
manner
of
receiving
the
intelligence
she
gave
him
made
a
mistake
about
it
she
said
pinching
nervously
at
the
edges
of

apron
she
wore
may
be

dead
asked
sydney
paying
no
attention
to
her
disturbed

is
was
the
reply
did
you
see
him
last
went
on
sydney
do
you
know
i
ever
saw
him
asked
the
old
lady
quickly
sydney
began
to
lose
his
patience
seem
to
think
i
mean
you
some
harm
he
said
are
quite
wrong
there
it
is
a
matter
of
money
of
a
fortune
that
belongs
to
maurice
parley
if
i
can
find
the
old
lady
looked
at
him
keenly
what
caused
all
his
trouble
she
said
slowly
he
was
always
thinking
of
you
tell
me
where
he
is
now
sydney
went
on
in
a
coaxing
tone
appear
to
know
a
good
deal
about
do
i
show
it
a
terrified
look
came
into
the
old
eyes
her
fingers
clutched
tightly
at
each
side
of
the
doorway
over
which
she
had
mounted
guard
sydney
was
by
this
time
convinced
that
there
was
some
mystery
about
maurice
darley
which
the
woman
before
him
was
seeking
to
conceal
if
he
is
dead
the
old
lady
brought
this
out
with
a
sort
of
triumphant
tone
he
dead
sydney
returned
with
almost
the
same
manner
he
was
you
would
have
said
so
long
ago
you
see
i
can
understand
some
things
but
why
are
you
so
secret
about
him
tell
me
did
you
ever
hear
him
speak
of
a
tyler
hush
the
old
lady
put
her
fingers
over
her
lips
and
advanced
to
sydney
as
if
to
thrust
him
out
of
the
door
now
not
here
she
added
in
an
imploring
tone
sydney
was
compelled
to
back
out
of
the
door
into
the
street
but
he
held
it
open
partially
to
say
must
find
out
about
maurice
darley
it
is
for
his
good
not
mine
where
can
i
see
you
about
him
will
you
come
to
my
office
on
chestnut
street
no
i
go
away
the
old
lady
replied
she
was
glancing
backward
over
her
shoulder
every
instant
or
two
you
give
me
your
name
then
so
i
can
write
to
you
sydney
went
on
if
i
write
to
darley
here
will
you
give
it
to
him
only
write
to
me
hannah
fox
and
with
that
the
door
was
closed
in
his
face
sydney
lingered
in
front
of
it
a
second
he
had
a
blind
impulse
to
ring
the
bell
and
compel
her
to
open
it
again
but
he
knew
that
it
would
be
useless
so
he
turned
his
steps
slowly
toward
chestnut
street
and
went
to
his
office
he
found
that
his
absence
all
day
had
been
productive
of
not
a
little
harm
this
is
a
part
of
the
expiation
he
murmured
to
himself
he
put
aside
the
letters
waiting
to
be
answered
and
set
himself
to
the
task
of
composing
the
one
to
fox
it
took
him
a
long
while
to
write
it
he
tore
up
several
completed
ones
the
usual
hour
for
closing
the
office
arrived
the
boy
hovered
about
his
desk
seeming
to
hope
that
his
presence
would
remind
his
employer
that
it
was
time
to
go
home
sydney
looked
up
at
last
may
go
john
he
said
will
mail
but
when
the
boy
had
gone
he
read
over
what
he
had
written
then
tore
it
into
very
small
pieces
and
dropped
them
in
the
waste
paper
basket
then
he
took
a
fresh
sheet
and
began
again
he
was
half
way
down
the
first
page
when
the
door
opened
and
rex
came
in
he
exclaimed
you
coming
home
to
dinner
we
waited
till
seven
then
mother
grew
so
worried
that
i
came
down
to
see
if
anything
had
good
you
are
to
me
reggie
said
the
other
how
little
i
deserve
his
head
went
down
on
his
two
arms
upon
the
desk
his
frame
shook
as
if
with
sobbing
you
dear
old
fellow
talk
that
way
what
is
troubling
you
rex
had
put
his
arm
about
his
neck
his
forehead
pressed
close
against
the
bowed
head
reggie
if
you
only
knew
you
would
not
want
to
touch
sydney
lifted
his
head
suddenly
but
his
arms
were
still
crossed
over
the
half
written
letter
what
do
you
mean
rex
looked
at
his
brother
in
deep
perplexity
his
handsome
brow
wrinkled
with
the
anxiety
appearance
and
demeanor
were
causing
him
will
know
soon
enough
reggie
and
then
promise
me
that
you
will
try
to
think
of
me
as
friendly
as
you
can
not
give
away
utterly
to
your
contempt
it
was
partly
for
no
i
will
not
say
that
no
go
home
rex
tell
mother
i
am
all
right
and
will
be
back
some
time
and
not
to
you
ought
not
to
stay
here
and
work
syd
rex
persisted
are
not
fit
to
do
must
do
what
set
out
to
voice
was
almost
stern
as
he
made
this
reply
rex
saw
that
it
was
useless
to
linger
and
went
sadly
home
something
dreadful
had
evidently
come
over
sydney
what
it
was
he
did
not
pretend
to
know
but
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
tell
the
family
all
that
sydney
had
said
it
was
nearly
nine
that
night
before
the
young
lawyer
finished
the
letter
to
fox
to
suit
him
he
dropped
it
in
the
corner
letter
box
on
his
way
home
and
then
stepped
in
at
a
restaurant
to
at
least
go
through
the
form
of
eating
something
shall
i
tell
them
at
home
about
it
was
his
one
thought
and
the
ever
recurring
echo
to
it
was
yet
not
yet
almost
his
greatest
trial
of
the
day
was
forcing
himself
to
remain
in
the
library
a
half
hour
after
he
reached
the
house
and
trying
to
appear
himself
he
was
conscious
that
rex
was
watching
him
closely
but
it
was
natural
for
him
to
plead
fatigue
after
a
hard
work
he
locked
himself
in
his
room
after
he
reached
it
with
hands
tightly
pressed
against
his
forehead
he
sank
into
a
chair
foresaw
all
this
he
muttered
knew
that
i
must
always
suffer
that
what
i
did
was
done
for
others
is
no
excuse
and
now
they
must
suffer
he
slept
this
night
from
sheer
exhaustion
but
the
sleep
was
much
disturbed
by
dreams
in
all
of
which
a
white
haired
old
lady
with
the
face
of
a
fox
seemed
to
be
trying
to
do
him
some
bodily
injury
the
next
day
he
seemed
to
exist
for
nothing
but
the
arrival
of
the
mails
but
night
came
and
no
response
to
his
letter
to
fox
the
following
morning
he
tried
to
get
up
but
his
head
was
so
dizzy
that
he
was
forced
to
drop
back
on
the
pillow
again
fortunately
he
had
not
locked
his
door
this
time
so
that
when
they
came
to
inquire
about
him
they
were
able
to
get
in
it
was
roy
who
came
first
mail
from
the
office
was
all
sydney
had
strength
to
say
when
he
saw
him
i
will
bring
it
for
you
replied
roy
and
he
decided
to
give
up
school
for
the
day
the
doctor
was
summoned
again
and
prescribed
perfect
quiet
but
after
he
had
gone
sydney
asked
so
persistently
if
roy
had
come
with
his
letters
that
when
he
did
arrive
pell
thought
that
the
quickest
way
to
quiet
the
patient
was
to
let
him
come
in
with
them
only
want
to
see
one
of
them
sydney
whispered
quickly
as
rex
took
a
seat
by
the
bedside
some
dozen
letters
in
his
lap
one
syd
asked
roy
gently
is
from
an
old
fox
it
will
probably
be
in
a
plain
this
is
it
then
shall
i
open
it
and
see
no
give
it
to
me
replied
sydney
quickly
he
took
the
envelope
and
the
knife
roy
handed
to
him
but
his
fingers
trembled
so
that
he
could
do
nothing
shall
have
to
let
you
open
it
after
all
roy
he
said
and
handed
them
both
back
roy
slit
the
end
of
the
envelope
in
a
second
and
once
more
put
it
into
his
hands
with
dilated
eyes
and
breath
coming
in
brief
gasps
sydney
drew
out
the
inclosure
he
unfolded
it
and
looked
eagerly
at
the
signature
see
quite
clearly
rex
he
said
after
an
instant
that
fox
signed
to
this
hannah
sydney
turned
to
the
front
page
and
began
to
read
suddenly
he
gave
a
little
cry
see
the
words
roy
he
said
is
the
matter
with
my
sight
you
will
have
to
read
it
to
me
never
mind
if
some
of
the
things
it
says
sound
strange
to
you
i
will
explain
them
by
and
by
roy
took
the
letter
and
read
as
follows
sydney
pell
dear
sir
tomorrow
night
at
midnight
ring
knock
lightly
on
the
door
yours
truly
hannah
fox
that
is
murmured
sydney
can
i
go
chapter
xxix
a
midnight
visit
you
want
me
to
write
a
note
for
you
saying
you
come
said
roy
no
i
must
go
replied
sydney
you
roy
was
about
to
answer
then
he
checked
himself
and
said
instead
perhaps
you
will
be
well
enough
to
go
is
it
far
for
there
was
no
address
given
in
the
letter
not
very
it
is
right
in
the
city
here
but
you
write
for
me
the
old
lady
know
that
seen
her
letter
notice
the
difference
in
the
handwriting
but
midnight
what
a
queer
time
to
appoint
just
like
her
though
now
i
will
try
and
get
some
sleep
so
as
to
help
prepare
myself
for
the
receipt
of
the
letter
appeared
to
have
eased
mind
somewhat
for
he
slept
until
well
on
in
the
afternoon
and
then
he
woke
feeling
somewhat
better
can
go
roy
after
all
he
said
to
his
brother
cheerfully
but
roy
did
not
see
how
he
could
go
still
he
thought
it
was
best
not
to
say
anything
till
the
time
came
just
before
night
sydney
called
roy
to
the
bedside
a
coupé
for
me
to
be
here
at
half
past
eleven
he
said
you
are
not
fit
to
go
syd
the
other
could
not
help
but
respond
will
be
when
the
time
comes
was
the
reply
will
see
say
nothing
to
the
others
about
let
me
go
with
you
suggested
roy
perhaps
you
may
but
you
will
sit
in
the
carriage
now
go
out
and
order
it
roy
felt
somewhat
burdened
with
a
secret
to
keep
from
the
family
but
he
trusted
sydney
fully
so
he
felt
that
it
was
all
right
the
patient
grew
a
little
better
in
the
evening
at
half
past
eight
he
called
roy
to
him
and
whispered
had
better
lie
down
and
get
some
rest
now
take
my
alarm
clock
and
put
it
at
quarter
past
but
roy
knew
it
was
no
use
to
take
the
clock
he
was
sure
he
could
not
sleep
he
was
far
too
anxious
and
excited
for
that
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
in
his
own
room
and
tried
to
read
but
he
did
not
see
a
word
on
the
page
he
was
thinking
of
sydney
presently
rex
came
in
he
flung
himself
down
on
the
bed
exclaiming
i
feel
exactly
as
if
something
was
going
to
happen
i
get
to
sleep
so
no
use
in
my
going
to
bed
worried
about
syd
there
is
something
mighty
queer
about
much
better
roy
responded
encouragingly
i
know
but
his
actions
all
through
this
thing
that
worried
about
do
you
know
that
i
sometimes
think
here
rex
sat
up
on
the
bed
and
lowered
his
voice
sometimes
think
that
perhaps
there
was
a
touch
of
insanity
in
family
you
know
we
are
always
forgetting
that
he
one
of
it
anything
in
particular
makes
you
think
that
reggie
said
roy
wondering
what
rex
would
say
if
he
knew
about
that
expedition
yes
one
thing
taken
with
a
lot
of
other
things
and
he
proceeded
to
tell
of
what
sydney
had
said
to
him
at
the
office
when
he
went
down
there
the
previous
night
seems
to
have
the
idea
that
he
has
committed
some
crime
rex
went
on
really
think
that
we
ought
to
watch
him
seem
to
me
to
be
as
serious
as
that
responded
roy
as
you
say
we
ought
to
watch
him
rex
lay
quiet
for
a
time
thoughts
were
disturbing
ones
reginald
too
was
worrying
over
condition
but
that
note
from
hannah
fox
was
something
tangible
there
was
no
chimera
of
the
imagination
about
that
perhaps
it
was
a
real
anxiety
that
was
preying
on
mind
very
likely
something
connected
with
his
parentage
roy
had
not
thought
of
this
before
he
was
about
to
suggest
it
to
relieve
his
mind
when
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
rex
was
asleep
then
he
glanced
at
the
clock
on
the
bureau
and
saw
that
it
pointed
to
five
minutes
to
eleven
let
him
sleep
on
now
he
decided
be
sure
to
be
around
when
we
go
and
sure
syd
want
him
to
roy
went
across
the
hall
to
his
elder
room
he
found
him
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
bed
looking
very
pale
guess
have
to
help
me
dress
roy
he
said
with
a
sorry
sort
of
smile
better
send
a
telegram
roy
rejoined
be
any
handwriting
to
recognize
on
no
i
must
go
myself
you
will
understand
some
day
very
soon
why
i
feel
this
way
and
then
roy
you
may
pity
me
and
forgive
me
if
you
roy
thought
of
his
theory
talk
was
very
strange
but
not
stranger
than
this
midnight
proceeding
well
he
would
wait
until
he
had
seen
this
last
through
before
deciding
whether
or
not
he
ought
to
report
to
his
mother
he
helped
sydney
on
with
his
clothes
then
went
to
the
window
to
see
if
the
carriage
was
there
he
saw
it
standing
in
the
glare
of
a
street
lamp
it
was
just
half
past
eleven
he
started
to
his
own
room
to
get
his
coat
careful
to
make
no
noise
roy
sydney
cautioned
him
but
when
roy
entered
his
own
apartment
there
was
rex
sitting
up
on
the
bed
rubbing
his
eyes
roy
hoped
he
would
go
at
once
to
his
room
but
he
began
to
talk
about
the
strangeness
of
his
having
fallen
asleep
in
that
way
and
then
when
he
saw
what
time
it
was
wanted
to
know
why
roy
gone
to
bed
could
i
when
you
were
in
the
way
roy
answered
smilingly
and
just
then
sydney
called
to
him
softly
from
down
the
hall
you
coming
there
was
no
help
for
it
roy
went
to
the
closet
and
took
down
his
overcoat
where
are
you
going
this
time
of
night
roy
pell
demanded
rex
out
for
a
little
while
good
night
old
fellow
better
go
straight
to
look
here
rex
was
following
him
out
into
the
hall
is
mighty
queer
your
going
off
this
way
does
mother
know
about
it
rex
ceased
abruptly
he
had
come
face
to
face
with
sydney
all
dressed
for
the
street
what
are
you
doing
up
sydney
asked
and
to
rex
his
voice
sounded
cold
and
stern
fell
asleep
on
bed
but
where
are
you
two
going
not
fit
to
be
out
of
bed
syd
as
the
latter
reeled
and
made
a
quick
clutch
at
the
bannisters
help
me
down
stairs
with
him
and
make
any
roy
spoke
in
an
authoritative
tone
and
rex
meekly
obeyed
rex
had
better
come
along
too
i
ordered
a
coach
so
that
you
could
put
your
feet
up
be
plenty
of
roy
whispered
this
in
ear
as
they
went
slowly
down
the
stairs
right
just
as
you
say
i
suppose
it
make
much
difference
how
soon
you
all
know
you
may
come
along
if
you
like
said
roy
when
they
reached
the
lower
hall
and
sydney
was
sitting
on
the
settee
up
quickly
and
get
your
rex
eagerly
seized
the
opportunity
and
in
five
minutes
they
were
all
in
the
carriage
and
the
driver
had
started
for
seventh
street
sydney
was
considerably
exhausted
by
the
effort
he
had
already
made
he
lay
back
in
the
seat
breathing
heavily
you
know
where
we
are
going
and
what
for
rex
leaned
forward
to
whisper
in
ear
a
mystery
to
me
too
but
we
want
to
watch
out
carefully
that
no
harm
comes
to
syd
roy
whispered
back
when
the
carriage
halted
before
the
little
dwelling
where
fox
lived
roy
started
to
get
out
but
sydney
drew
him
back
i
must
be
alone
he
said
the
carriage
wait
here
till
i
come
but
he
had
scarcely
taken
a
step
from
the
carriage
when
his
weakness
overpowered
him
he
tottered
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
rex
sprung
out
and
caught
him
roy
was
at
his
other
side
in
an
instant
and
together
the
two
boys
supported
him
will
have
to
help
me
up
to
the
door
i
guess
he
whispered
faintly
ring
knock
there
was
no
one
passing
at
the
moment
nor
did
any
light
shine
from
the
interior
of
the
place
roy
knocked
against
the
glass
in
the
door
and
the
latter
was
opened
on
the
merest
crack
there
came
the
demand
in
a
quivering
old
voice
pell
i
am
ill
but
i
was
bound
to
come
my
two
brothers
are
with
me
they
help
me
in
to
a
seat
they
will
then
go
away
no
they
come
in
was
the
quick
response
must
be
no
noise
a
risk
to
have
you
can
you
open
the
door
wide
enough
to
help
me
in
returned
sydney
the
answer
was
the
swinging
back
of
the
door
and
the
reaching
out
of
the
old
arm
back
to
the
carriage
boys
and
wait
said
sydney
and
the
next
instant
he
had
disappeared
within
the
mysterious
dwelling
chapter

sydney
frees
his
mind
pretty
weak
you
this
was
remark
as
she
eased
sydney
down
into
a
rocking
chair
in
the
little
parlor
it
was
quite
dark
save
for
the
faint
light
that
came
in
from
the
street
lamp
over
the
curtain
pole
in
the
window
suppose
i
was
too
weak
to
venture
to
come
sydney
answered
i
felt
that
i
must
did
you
understand
all
that
i
meant
to
say
in
my
note
understand
that
you
know
of
a
great
sum
of
money
that
is
coming
to
maurice
darley
strange
very
is
it
did
you
know
anything
about
it
did
you
expect
it
there
was
a
note
of
alarm
in
tones
not
that
in
particular
but
you
must
tell
me
all
the
details
before
i
dare
to
tell
any
the
old
lady
seated
herself
on
a
low
chair
close
to
side
it
was
extremely
weird
this
confidential
talk
in
the
darkness
details
do
you
want
sydney
asked
proofs
that
there
is
really
something
to
this
fortune
maurice
has
talked
too
much
about
others
that
have
nothing
to
see
him
often
then
exclaimed
sydney
eagerly
here
commanded
the
old
lady
in
a
stern
whisper
he
is
here
he
is
in
the
back
room
yonder
i
am
so
afraid
he
will
hear
us
that
is
why
i
had
you
come
at
midnight
when
he
would
be
sound
why
can
i
not
see
him
he
is
in
his
mind
he
is
all
the
while
fancying
that
he
is
rich
a
talk
about
money
would
excite
him
so
that
i
fear
the
you
say
he
knew
tyler
sydney
remembered
and
spoke
this
name
very
softly
he
talks
of
him
continually
he
in
his
office
once
i
believe
more
question
has
this
darley
any
children
had
one
boy
but
it
must
have
died
when
a
baby
soon
after
darley
did
and
now
do
you
know
why
i
do
not
want
you
to
come
here
with
stories
of
riches
for
maurice
darley
daft
on
the
subject
already
i
do
not
want
him
to
go
so
far
that
they
will
take
him
away
from
are
fond
of
him
then
asked
sydney
is
all
i
have
if
he
goes
i
must
live
alone
it
is
my
delight
to
care
for
him
the
little
money
david
left
me
is
enough
for
my
simple
wants
maurice
lives
like
a
lord
in
his
fancies
why
do
you
want
to
come
and
disturb
us
in
our
content
i
must
sydney
broke
out
as
passionately
as
he
could
in
restrained
tones
you
understand
that
the
money
which
belongs
to
maurice
darley
i
have
been
diverting
to
other
uses
it
was
left
to
him
by
tyler
but
i
tore
up
the
will
he
made
it
about
three
hours
after
another
one
in
which
he
had
left
everything
to
the
woman
who
had
acted
as
a
mother
to
me
for
twenty
years
was
a
vacillating
old
man
i
felt
that
he
might
change
his
mind
back
again
if
he
should
live
three
hours
longer
so
when
he
was
dead
i
tore
up
the
last
will
i
alone
knew
what
it
contained
and
i
have
been
a
miserable
man
ever
sydney
bowed
his
head
on
his
hands
and
there
was
silence
in
the
little
room
for
a
moment
or
two
are
a
criminal
then
said
the
old
lady
presently
sydney
winced
at
the
term
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
a
sense
of
relief
as
one
does
after
taking
a
plunge
into
cold
water
at
any
rate
the
shock
of
the
first
contact
was
over
i
suppose
i
am
he
answered
i
am
ready
to
suffer
the
penalty
the
only
excuse
i
have
to
offer
is
the
fact
that
what
i
did
i
did
not
for
myself
but
for
those
i
love
who
have
done
so
much
for
me
and
now
it
is
not
joy
but
misery
i
shall
bring
are
repentant
though
murmured
the
old
lady
softly
is
not
as
if
you
were
hardened
and
only
gave
up
when
some
one
else
found
it
out
and
forced
you
to
there
is
hope
for
you
in
that
but
how
much
money
is
there
half
a
million
but
some
of
it
has
been
used
put
into
a
house
which
of
course
will
be
given
up
to
you
will
take
him
away
from
me
it
was
almost
a
wail
with
which
the
old
lady
said
this
you
can
come
with
him
of
it
will
be
his
taking
care
of
me
then
and
that
will
be
so
different
oh
why
did
you
come
to
disturb
us
she
seemed
quite
forgetful
for
the
time
of
the
presence
of
any
one
else
in
the
room
of
her
own
caution
to
sydney
to
speak
quietly
suddenly
she
appeared
to
recollect
this
latter
necessity
she
ceased
the
half
moaning
she
had
begun
and
clutched
arm
tightly
suppose
she
whispered
it
would
not
be
right
to
ask
you
to
keep
this
money
keep
it
sydney
replied
have
suffered
enough
from
it
how
can
you
give
it
to
a
man
who
is
not
in
his
right
mind
he
thinks
he
is
a
wealthy
man
i
have
given
him
a
quantity
of
gilt
paper
to
play
with
he
is
like
a
child
you
know
the
possession
of
real
money
will
not
make
him
any
there
is
the
son
suggested
sydney
told
you
he
was
am
not
so
sure
of
that
i
think
i
have
seen
him
would
he
not
be
about
seventeen
now
and
you
have
seen
him
it
was
with
difficulty
the
old
lady
kept
her
tones
within
bounds
you
can
not
be
sure
it
is
the
same
she
went
on
i
can
not
be
certain
but
i
am
pretty
he
looks
like
his
father
wait
i
think
i
can
find
a
picture
of
him
in
the
i
can
not
see
it
in
the
holding
it
close
to
the
window
you
can
get
the
ray
from
the
lamp
on
it
there
here
it
is
i
fox
took
the
portrait
to
the
front
of
the
room
and
parting
the
curtains
a
little
held
it
for
sydney
to
look
at
it
is
very
like
he
said
picture
must
have
been
taken
when
darley
was
quite
sat
for
it
before
he
was
married
but
where
is
this
boy
at
a
little
town
out
in
new
jersey
he
wants
to
find
his
comes
it
he
dead
the
old
lady
wanted
to
know
sydney
told
the
story
of
miles
harding
as
he
had
heard
it
from
rex
you
know
why
he
was
compelled
to
give
up
the
child
he
added
i
suppose
you
know
he
was
very
sick
once
and
he
lost
everything
that
was
what
unsettled
his
reason
but
to
think
he
should
have
given
out
that
the
child
was
dead
you
ever
hear
him
speak
of
the
morriseys
i
never
heard
the
name
before
but
i
should
like
to
see
this
boy
does
he
know
that
his
father
is
living
not
yet
you
see
i
did
not
hear
of
it
until
tonight
but
i
must
not
stay
longer
my
brothers
are
waiting
for
me
in
the
carriage
we
must
arrange
what
we
are
going
to
know
what
to
say
the
boy
ought
to
have
his
rights
we
fix
it
all
quietly
some
way
i
think
you
meant
to
do
i
did
i
did
everything
with
my
eyes
open
i
ought
to
suffer
for
it
the
only
trouble
is
that
those
i
love
will
suffer
with
me
but
you
think
the
restoration
of
fortune
will
bring
back
mind
know
i
tell
about
that
he
is
very
you
have
a
doctor
for
him
no
be
afraid
want
to
take
him
away
i
expect
selfish
about
it
but
bring
the
boy
here
he
is
old
enough
we
can
talk
it
over
with
him
and
maybe
his
father
will
recognize
can
come
any
time
then
said
sydney
now
i
know
who
you
night
then
i
shall
see
you
soon
again
i
feel
better
than
when
i
sydney
rose
and
walked
to
the
door
without
assistance
as
soon
as
the
boys
saw
him
they
hurried
out
to
help
him
into
the
carriage
within
three
minutes
they
were
driving
towards
home
and
a
church
clock
near
by
chimed
half
past
twelve
began
sydney
have
something
to
tell
you
i
was
not
glad
before
that
i
was
not
your
own
brother
i
am
glad
of
it
now
am
a
there
was
a
pause
no
one
spoke
there
was
no
sound
but
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
it
was
too
dark
to
see
the
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
twins
rex
was
leaning
partly
forward
one
hand
gripping
knee
he
could
think
of
nothing
save
the
night
keeler
had
spent
with
them
and
the
horror
they
had
had
of
him
before
they
found
out
that
it
was
his
brother
whose
picture
was
in
that
book
chapter
xxxi
the
confession
to
the
boys
the
carriage
had
gone
two
squares
before
the
silence
in
it
was
broken
then
roy
spoke
is
it
syd
he
said
am
sure
you
are
worrying
yourself
needlessly
over
magnifying
it
from
a
molehill
into
a
oh
boys
would
that
i
were
but
as
soon
as
i
tell
you
you
will
understand
it
all
and
i
shall
tell
you
a
minute
but
just
give
me
your
hand
each
of
you
that
i
may
feel
the
warm
pressure
of
your
confidence
you
know
the
worst
of
roy
and
rex
instantly
put
out
their
hands
syd
took
one
in
each
of
his
and
held
them
tight
for
an
instant
then
he
dropped
them
quickly
and
began
to
speak
rapidly
you
remember
roy
the
night
last
july
you
went
home
in
carriage
and
left
me
alone
with
tyler
the
will
that
left
all
his
money
to
mother
had
been
signed
and
witnessed
you
know
what
it
contained
i
felt
so
rejoiced
for
you
all
although
i
had
no
idea
then
that
there
was
a
chance
of
your
so
soon
coming
into
possession
sat
talking
to
the
old
man
for
an
hour
or
so
about
his
investments
and
the
various
savings
banks
in
which
his
money
was
deposited
finally
he
appeared
to
grow
restless
you
got
that
will
i
made
sydney
he
asked
pointed
it
out
to
him
where
it
lay
on
the
table
can
make
another
one
i
he
went
on
many
as
you
please
i
told
him
write
out
this
one
and
sign
it
he
said
and
he
dictated
a
document
that
left
every
penny
of
his
fortune
except
the
five
thousand
to
ann
and
a
thousand
he
left
to
you
roy
to
maurice
darley
if
living
or
his
heirs
if
dead
and
ann
can
witness
it
he
told
me
and
i
called
her
in
and
she
wrote
her
name
under
mine
named
myself
and
martin
as
executors
just
as
before
and
said
that
i
could
probably
find
maurice
darley
without
much
trouble
he
turned
over
in
bed
then
and
i
asked
him
where
darley
was
when
he
last
heard
from
him
but
he
did
not
answer
i
went
over
to
the
bed
and
looked
at
him
and
found
that
he
was
dead
the
temptation
flashed
into
my
mind
a
shame
i
thought
owing
to
the
caprice
of
a
foolish
old
man
these
people
who
have
been
so
good
to
me
should
be
deprived
of
the
fortune
which
had
just
been
left
to
them
this
darley
is
undoubtedly
rich
he
has
behaved
contemptibly
to
the
man
who
did
so
much
for
him
why
should
he
get
the
money
i
recollected
that
you
had
gone
into
the
kitchen
roy
earlier
in
the
evening
to
get
ann
to
sign
the
first
will
and
then
the
doctor
had
told
you
that
it
was
not
necessary
i
reasoned
that
she
would
undoubtedly
suppose
that
the
will
she
did
sign
was
the
only
one
that
had
been
made
because
i
was
sure
she
had
not
read
it
these
things
flashed
into
my
mind
within
a
few
seconds
of
time
as
i
stood
by
the
bedside
of
the
dead
man
my
determination
was
quickly
taken
i
knew
that
ann
had
gone
home
that
there
was
no
one
near
to
see
the
deed
took
the
new
will
and
held
it
in
the
flame
of
the
candle
till
it
was
entirely
consumed
then
i
blew
the
cinders
so
that
they
scattered
about
the
room
and
would
not
attract
syd
this
in
a
kind
of
gasp
from
roy
rex
said
nothing
he
was
sitting
upright
now
still
seeming
to
see
before
him
the
face
of
criminal
brother
i
knew
you
would
all
shrink
from
me
when
you
knew
went
on
sydney
he
spoke
in
a
voice
that
was
almost
hard
now
it
was
as
if
it
had
become
so
from
the
spurring
that
was
necessary
to
enable
him
to
make
his
confession
shrank
from
myself
as
soon
as
the
last
piece
of
tinder
had
vanished
from
the
candlestick
i
could
not
bear
to
stay
in
the
house
i
hurried
off
to
the
and
then
stopped
at
to
tell
him
that
the
miser
was
dead
said
something
about
the
good
fortune
that
had
come
to
us
so
quickly
i
shuddered
and
hurried
home
but
i
could
not
sleep
i
seemed
to
have
become
an
old
man
in
that
one
instant
while
i
held
that
sheet
of
paper
in
the
flame
of
the
the
reason
we
did
not
see
you
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
said
roy
softly
i
felt
that
i
could
not
face
you
all
just
that
is
why
you
looked
so
terrible
and
fainted
away
when
i
told
scott
bowman
about
our
inheritance
at
your
office
added
rex
i
was
planning
all
sorts
of
ways
to
fix
things
so
we
take
the
money
then
i
saw
it
was
too
late
now
you
know
what
has
been
on
my
mind
all
these
months
i
knew
that
my
health
was
being
undermined
by
the
strain
but
i
did
not
care
for
that
i
even
hoped
at
times
that
i
might
die
because
then
i
felt
that
you
need
never
was
it
anything
in
particular
that
made
you
tell
us
asked
rex
it
seems
very
strange
how
things
come
about
but
then
it
often
happens
so
do
you
remember
telling
me
the
name
of
the
man
who
left
your
friend
miles
with
the
and
it
was
darley
the
same
name
you
mentioned
just
now
and
you
fainted
then
just
as
you
did
that
time
at
the
office
you
mean
that
i
am
almost
certain
that
miles
morrisey
is
really
a
darley
the
son
of
maurice
darley
to
whom
all
this
money
belongs
when
i
suspected
this
i
knew
that
the
end
had
i
must
trace
the
thing
down
and
at
this
point
the
carriage
halted
before
the
door
of
the
house
rex
sprang
out
then
roy
and
both
boys
waited
to
help
sydney
but
he
made
no
movement
to
follow
them
you
going
to
get
out
syd
asked
roy
i
have
no
right
to
live
among
you
any
more
now
that
you
know
it
will
seem
like
having
a
convict
in
the
house
i
can
go
to
some
hotel
you
can
send
my
things
to
me
and
i
will
stay
there
this
is
settled
up
and
they
put
me
roy
stepped
into
the
carriage
and
put
his
face
so
close
to
that
the
latter
felt
the
smooth
flesh
against
his
growth
of
beard
old
fellow
whispered
roy
must
come
we
cast
you
off
besides
we
want
you
with
us
to
help
us
decide
what
to
be
so
good
to
me
roy
i
bear
but
as
he
spoke
sydney
got
out
and
the
three
went
up
the
steps
nothing
was
said
as
they
ascended
the
stairs
there
was
danger
of
disturbing
the
household
night
syd
said
roy
when
they
reached
the
top
he
put
out
his
hand
but
sydney
did
not
see
it
in
the
darkness
night
roy
he
responded
rex
said
nothing
but
when
door
closed
behind
him
he
drew
roy
into
his
room
with
him
must
stay
with
me
roy
he
said
and
he
began
taking
off
his
coat
you
speak
to
syd
before
we
came
in
reggie
roy
i
feel
awfully
sorry
for
him
but
committed
a
crime
and
i
help
but
think
all
the
while
of
face
was
pale
he
looked
almost
as
sydney
had
looked
at
one
time
are
we
going
to
do
rex
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
a
despairing
droop
to
the
shoulders
that
he
usually
carried
so
squarely
must
give
up
everything
to
the
rightful
where
shall
we
go
then
sold
our
house
in
marley
and
spent
the
money
we
got
for
it
be
worse
off
than
we
were
before
roy
oh
dear
why
did
you
ever
look
up
at
that
trestle
and
see
that
old
man
crawl
out
on
it
wished
i
before
now
replied
roy
gravely
money
made
us
happy
as
you
expected
it
would
and
now
see
what
misery
it
has
brought
but
i
suppose
wrong
for
me
to
regret
doing
what
i
did
and
think
so
hard
of
syd
reggie
remember
that
he
did
what
he
did
not
for
himself
but
for
try
my
best
but
i
feel
now
as
if
i
could
ever
touch
him
again
and
think
what
he
has
brought
us
to
poverty
after
just
giving
us
the
taste
of
the
twins
did
not
sleep
much
that
night
chapter
xxxii
a
hard
day
for
the
twins
roy
and
rex
slept
far
into
the
morning
which
was
saturday
they
were
awakened
finally
by
a
persistent
knocking
on
the
door
and
voice
you
boys
going
to
sleep
all
day
have
you
forgotten
we
were
all
going
to
marley
at
eleven
and
a
note
syd
left
for
you
rex
much
better
and
gone
to
the
office
get
up
now
or
we
save
right
responded
roy
and
he
shook
his
brother
and
told
him
about
note
wonder
what
about
murmured
rex
then
he
saw
it
on
the
carpet
where
jess
had
poked
it
under
the
door
he
snatched
it
up
eagerly
and
read
am
going
to
telegraph
for
miles
to
come
in
and
stay
over
sunday
he
must
be
told
while
he
is
here
he
will
get
to
the
house
in
time
for
wonder
if
he
expects
me
to
tell
him
muttered
rex
scott
be
mighty
queer
to
entertain
a
fellow
in
a
house
that
really
belongs
to
him
i
wonder
when
mother
and
the
girls
are
to
be
told
added
roy
you
suppose
syd
could
have
told
mother
already
but
there
was
no
sign
that
pell
knew
from
her
demeanor
when
she
poured
the
coffee
for
them
must
go
down
and
see
syd
about
it
said
roy
as
they
went
out
into
the
hall
together
have
to
go
to
marley
without
sure
i
want
to
go
added
rex
their
decision
carried
dismay
to
the
hearts
of
the
girls
must
go
boys
said
eva
minturns
have
invited
us
to
lunch
we
have
accepted
and
it
would
be
very
impolite
for
you
not
to
go
now
besides
jess
and
i
come
home
after
dark
you
knew
what
i
do
you
feel
like
going
either
returned
rex
not
heeding
the
warning
glance
cast
at
him
by
his
brother
do
you
know
rex
asked
jess
looking
from
one
twin
to
the
other
with
a
keen
gaze
is
something
between
those
two
she
added
turning
to
her
sister
take
roy
eva
and
take
rex
and
make
them
up
and
the
method
of
employed
was
to
tickle
the
boys
who
were
each
very
susceptible
to
this
form
of
torture
this
was
terrible
to
have
the
thing
turned
into
a
joke
when
it
was
so
fearfully
serious
roy
spoke
up
quickly
tell
you
in
a
little
while
now
girls
he
said
seriously
i
think
you
had
better
give
up
this
trip
to
what
excuse
will
we
send
the
minturns
roy
hesitated
this
was
a
poser
you
put
it
off
he
said
finally
as
a
makeshift
course
we
without
giving
a
reason
for
it
returned
jess
think
you
boys
are
just
as
mean
as
you
can
be
because
got
up
some
scheme
between
you
that
rather
do
than
go
with
us
you
just
jess
it
that
i
tell
you
now
come
rex
better
go
after
all
one
day
make
any
rex
objected
a
little
longer
but
was
at
last
won
over
suppose
we
could
tell
them
without
consent
he
said
when
he
and
roy
had
gone
up
stairs
to
get
their
coats
seem
exactly
like
dancing
on
our
own
not
so
bad
as
that
reggie
returned
roy
the
day
was
a
terribly
hard
one
to
both
boys
all
sorts
of
plans
were
discussed
and
adopted
for
future
good
times
charlie
and
ethel
minturn
were
invited
up
for
a
week
from
that
day
to
take
lunch
and
go
to
a
matinee
never
be
able
to
take
them
rex
found
opportunity
to
whisper
to
his
brother
wish
told
the
girls
about
it
this
do
i
but
i
like
to
till
syd
said
he
was
the
minturns
could
not
fail
to
notice
that
the
twins
had
something
on
their
minds
ethel
spoke
of
it
some
piece
of
mischief
be
bound
exclaimed
jess
whereupon
roy
and
rex
exchanged
glances
and
their
hearts
sank
lower
still
on
the
way
home
in
the
train
rex
announced
that
miles
morrisey
was
coming
that
evening
to
spend
sunday
with
them
i
thought
you
and
roy
were
going
to
a
meeting
of
your
school
society
returned
jess
it
been
for
that
we
could
have
stayed
to
dinner
at
the
scott
i
forgot
all
about
the
stylus
exclaimed
rex
it
matter
have
to
give
it
up
any
the
coming
of
night
seemed
to
bring
with
it
to
reginald
a
realizing
sense
of
all
that
the
new
order
of
things
would
mean
he
relapsed
into
thoughtfulness
in
the
midst
of
which
he
half
sprang
from
his
seat
with
an
inarticulate
exclamation
the
matter
rex
inquired
eva
nothing
he
responded
but
the
color
deepened
slightly
in
his
cheek
and
he
looked
furtively
at
roy
the
cause
of
his
start
was
the
remembrance
of
what
sydney
had
said
about
the
name
darley
having
caused
him
to
determine
to
confess
i
had
not
gone
off
with
harrington
that
time
was
inference
would
not
have
come
into
my
life
and
we
would
not
now
be
facing
but
the
blush
was
the
shame
at
the
idea
that
he
would
be
willing
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
crime
provided
he
did
not
know
about
it
always
feel
sorry
for
miles
when
he
comes
to
see
us
remarked
eva
asked
rex
quickly
he
seems
to
feel
embarrassed
as
though
he
were
out
of
place
he
in
the
least
he
has
very
nice
manners
and
sure
is
a
perfect
gentleman
but
what
he
needs
is
a
little
more
self
get
that
fast
enough
now
said
rex
and
then
looked
fixedly
away
from
the
scandalized
glance
he
knew
roy
was
directing
at
him
go
home
with
the
girls
if
wait
at
the
station
for
miles
rex
and
reginald
was
glad
to
be
left
alone
for
a
few
minutes
seem
as
if
it
could
be
so
he
mused
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
pavement
opposite
the
public
buildings
and
i
to
change
places
people
hurrying
to
catch
outgoing
trains
jostled
him
the
clang
of
the
cable
car
bells
sounded
every
few
seconds
the
noises
of
the
city
life
he
loved
were
all
about
him
shall
i
be
a
year
from
now
he
asked
himself
but
it
was
nearly
time
for
train
rex
turned
and
went
up
the
stairway
to
the
left
of
the
station
building
as
he
did
so
he
passed
a
familiar
face
coming
down
it
was
the
boy
who
got
him
into
trouble
with
the
chinaman
that
july
afternoon
six
months
before
but
rex
felt
no
resentment
now
that
was
the
only
trouble
i
had
to
think
about
he
told
himself
enviously
of
such
power
is
comparison
train
was
on
time
rex
saw
miles
standing
on
the
step
of
the
forward
car
ready
to
spring
off
at
the
first
opportunity
his
face
lighted
up
to
a
still
greater
radiance
at
sight
of
rex
waiting
for
him
think
come
to
meet
me
he
said
as
he
shook
hands
is
awfully
good
of
you
so
glad
to
see
there
was
no
doubt
of
this
one
could
read
it
at
once
in
the
way
he
looked
at
his
companion
suppose
you
were
surprised
to
get
telegram
remarked
rex
did
he
say
in
it
and
spend
sunday
with
rex
answered
the
other
was
here
only
a
little
while
ago
but
i
was
glad
enough
to
come
again
it
is
ever
so
kind
in
you
to
send
for
you
think
there
might
be
any
other
reason
for
our
sending
for
you
asked
rex
after
an
pause
a
troubled
look
crossed
face
what
do
you
mean
rex
you
remember
what
you
found
out
a
little
while
the
man
who
left
you
with
the
morriseys
my
father
has
your
brother
heard
anything
about
him
is
that
what
you
want
me
for
about
that
yes
not
sure
whether
your
father
has
been
found
but
something
else
has
been
found
that
belongs
to
what
is
that
asked
miles
eagerly
chapter
xxxiii
a
queer
fish
pond
party
miles
stared
at
rex
as
though
he
did
not
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
word
fortune
he
repeated
fortune
your
fortune
to
be
sure
returned
rex
i
understand
went
on
miles
can
i
have
a
fortune
enough
since
your
father
has
one
syd
knows
all
about
it
a
lucky
fellow
miles
somewhere
about
half
a
miles
looked
very
grave
for
half
a
minute
then
a
smile
broke
out
over
his
face
rex
he
said
see
through
your
joke
so
you
might
as
well
drop
it
you
to
have
made
the
sum
so
high
if
you
expected
me
to
believe
true
all
the
same
but
miles
still
shook
his
head
and
declared
he
should
wait
to
believe
till
sydney
told
him
all
about
it
wonder
if
syd
will
tell
him
the
whole
thing
tonight
rex
asked
himself
but
sydney
was
not
home
to
dinner
there
was
a
note
from
him
to
rex
however
asking
that
he
and
roy
and
miles
should
meet
him
at
the
continental
hotel
that
night
at
eight
this
threw
rex
into
a
great
state
of
excitement
he
knew
that
the
crisis
was
at
hand
roy
took
things
more
quietly
but
inwardly
he
was
none
the
less
excited
wants
us
to
meet
him
down
town
he
said
as
they
rose
from
the
table
he
had
been
waiting
for
rex
to
tell
miles
but
the
other
had
not
yet
brought
himself
to
do
it
are
you
going
jess
wanted
to
know
the
theater
indeed
responded
rex
then
he
folded
up
his
napkin
quickly
and
left
the
dining
room
this
visit
got
anything
to
do
with
my
father
miles
whispered
to
roy
as
they
went
out
into
the
hall
together
think
it
has
miles
but
i
know
much
more
about
it
than
you
there
was
not
much
said
by
the
three
boys
on
their
way
down
town
rex
was
in
one
of
his
silent
moods
and
made
no
effort
to
get
out
of
it
roy
tried
to
talk
but
there
was
such
a
weight
on
his
mind
that
he
made
but
poor
success
of
the
attempt
miles
was
far
too
excited
however
to
notice
the
difference
in
manner
of
the
twins
compared
with
their
usual
cordiality
they
found
sydney
waiting
for
them
in
the
corridor
of
the
hotel
he
was
looking
very
haggard
but
he
seemed
very
glad
to
see
miles
have
good
news
for
you
my
boy
he
said
and
bad
too
i
have
found
your
father
but
he
is
not
quite
do
you
mean
exclaimed
miles
while
roy
and
rex
looked
their
interest
mind
is
affected
sydney
went
on
hope
the
sight
of
you
may
have
a
favorable
effect
but
be
careful
not
to
be
excited
yourself
when
you
see
him
take
it
quite
as
a
matter
of
miles
drew
in
a
long
breath
it
was
going
to
be
rather
a
difficult
matter
for
him
to
take
easily
a
meeting
with
the
father
he
had
thought
never
to
see
is
he
he
asked
in
a
faint
tone
far
from
here
come
we
will
go
there
at
on
the
way
to
sydney
explained
that
he
and
the
old
lady
had
arranged
that
she
should
give
a
sort
of
party
at
which
darley
should
be
present
he
would
then
have
an
opportunity
to
study
miles
quietly
while
the
latter
was
engaged
in
playing
games
look
so
much
like
him
sydney
added
we
hope
he
may
recognize
miles
appeared
to
be
somewhat
astonished
when
they
halted
before
the
odd
little
home
in
seventh
street
but
he
said
nothing
and
the
next
moment
they
were
all
being
warmly
welcomed
by
fox
the
old
lady
was
so
excited
that
both
her
hands
and
voice
trembled
she
came
near
crying
when
she
first
saw
miles
but
she
greeted
him
exactly
as
she
had
the
twins
there
was
a
game
of
fish
pond
on
the
center
table
boys
she
said
your
they
all
drew
up
to
the
table
sydney
taking
a
rod
too
the
old
lady
stood
looking
on
behind
chair
presently
she
went
out
into
the
back
room
and
in
a
few
minutes
returned
accompanied
by
a
gentleman
who
did
not
look
to
be
over
he
was
dressed
very
handsomely
and
his
resemblance
to
miles
was
striking
darley
boys
said
fox
as
the
two
came
up
to
the
table
right
on
with
your
fishing
we
will
watch
she
had
taken
up
her
stand
this
time
behind
rex
who
was
sitting
just
opposite
miles
to
meet
you
boys
remarked
darley
in
a
pleasant
voice
is
the
market
rex
with
an
effort
collected
himself
sufficiently
to
answer
pretty
fair
pretty
fair
eh
went
on
the
other
at
it
though
bound
to
win
some
time
as
i
have
look
he
put
his
hand
in
the
side
pocket
of
his
coat
and
drew
forth
a
great
mass
of
chips
all
covered
with
gilt
paper
a
look
of
agony
was
on
face
it
was
almost
worse
than
finding
no
father
at
all
to
find
such
a
one
as
this
you
want
to
take
my
rod
and
fish
a
while
sir
he
said
feeling
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
longer
sit
still
you
you
are
very
kind
i
might
take
a
single
darley
stepped
around
to
take
seat
but
as
the
other
rose
they
were
face
to
face
and
very
close
to
each
other
for
an
instant
darley
put
out
both
hands
and
grasped
the
boy
by
the
shoulders
is
your
name
he
said
in
a
tone
that
was
quite
different
from
the
one
in
which
he
had
hitherto
spoken
it
was
much
more
decided
and
firmer
answered
the
other
trying
his
best
to
keep
his
excitement
down
he
could
see
fox
standing
just
behind
his
father
her
hands
clasped
together
in
an
agony
of
suspense
eh
well
you
look
as
if
your
name
ought
to
be
maurice
great
cæsar
he
look
like
me
fox
he
wheeled
around
so
suddenly
that
the
poor
old
lady
was
taken
quite
unawares
she
dropped
her
hands
quickly
to
her
sides
and
had
not
a
word
to
say
he
look
like
me
darley
now
appealed
to
sydney
who
managed
to
stammer
out
certainly
see
a
strong
resemblance
is
your
last
name
young
man
went
on
the
other
miles
hesitated
an
instant
he
was
about
to
say
darley
but
some
happy
instinct
prompted
him
to
substitute
darley
started
you
say
he
exclaimed
a
swift
change
passed
over
his
features
he
had
dropped
his
hand
from
shoulders
but
now
reached
forth
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
with
me
he
said
quietly
and
led
him
into
the
back
room
the
others
looked
at
one
another
without
speaking
no
one
thought
of
the
game
the
fish
lines
tangled
up
were
lying
in
the
pasteboard
pond
fox
had
sunk
down
on
the
sofa
her
head
covered
with
her
apron
from
the
inner
room
came
the
subdued
sound
of
voices
you
suppose
he
has
recognized
him
it
was
rex
who
at
length
broke
the
silence
and
he
spoke
in
an
awed
whisper
nobody
made
any
reply
for
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
from
the
rear
it
was
miles
his
face
was
handsomer
than
rex
had
ever
seen
it
it
was
lighted
up
with
joy
he
came
straight
to
rex
and
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
while
he
leaned
over
till
his
chin
rested
on
the
head
want
to
tell
you
first
rex
he
said
have
been
the
means
of
bringing
me
to
this
happiness
he
knows
me
his
mind
has
come
back
to
him
he
called
me
maurice
and
he
remembers
giving
me
to
the
morriseys
to
take
care
of
for
a
while
then
his
brain
went
back
on
him
and
he
thought
i
was
is
he
asked
rex
down
on
the
bed
he
is
utterly
exhausted
i
must
go
back
to
him
now
and
miles
hurried
off
again

this
time

fox
as
she

you
think
he
rex
began
and
came
to
a
sudden
stop
me
to
jail
syd
finished
for
him
may
he
has
a
right
to
do
it
i
deserve
to
go
oh
boys
i
wonder
how
you
can
bear
to
be
with
did
it
for
our
sakes
syd
responded
roy
but
rex
said
nothing
when
they
reached
the
house
they
found
eva
and
jess
in
the
parlor
entertaining
company
in
boys
eva
called
as
they
passed
the
door
roy
and
rex
obeyed
the
summons
leaving
sydney
to
go
up
to
pell
in
the
library
they
found
keeler
to
be
the
caller
rex
started
when
he
saw
who
it
was
where
is
miles
asked
jess
stayed
with
his
father
replied
rex
father
echoed
both
girls
has
he
found
him
answered
roy
found
him
a
story
for
you
keeler
a
regular
rex
began
to
look
nervous
he
feared
that
his
escapade
with
harrington
was
about
to
be
related
but
roy
skillfully
told
the
main
points
in
career
without
encroaching
on
this
keeler
stayed
until
ten
and
while
they
were
talking
and
laughing
in
the
parlor
the
twins
were
thinking
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
room
above
when
they
went
to
kiss
their
mother
good
night
they
saw
that
she
knew
the
girls
exclaimed
at
once
at
sight
of
her
face
are
ill
cried
eva
eva
rejoined
pell
is
worse
than
the
tears
welled
up
in
her
eyes
she
could
say
no
more
sydney
was
not
with
her
neither
was
he
in
his
room
the
girls
were
clamorous
to
know
what
was
the
matter
them
roy
i
pell
at
last
found
voice
to
say
rex
could
not
stay
to
hear
and
roy
never
suffered
as
he
did
in
the
few
moments
it
took
him
to
relate
his
foster
crime
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
as
cruel
as
to
drive
nails
into
the
fair
flesh
of
the
young
girls
and
yet
they
must
know
could
he
do
it
how
could
he
eva
murmured
again
and
again
he
jess
suddenly
exclaimed
nothing
to
show
for
second
will
i
mean
perhaps
something
wrong
with
his
brain
and
he
only
imagines
there
was
one
and
he
destroyed
but
roy
shook
his
head
there
was
ann
to
prove
if
necessary
that
she
had
signed
the
other
document
for
a
long
while
they
sat
there
it
seemed
as
if
black
despair
had
settled
upon
them
and
there
was
no
way
out
for
years
pell
had
leaned
upon
sydney
in
an
emergency
like
the
present
he
would
be
just
the
one
to
whom
she
would
go
for
counsel
and
had
failed
her
utterly
did
you
say
to
him
mother
asked
roy
after
a
while
you
kind
to
him
tried
to
be
i
tried
to
remember
that
he
had
done
all
for
our
sakes
but
i
feel
like
a
ship
without
a
roy
left
his
seat
near
eva
and
slipped
into
a
chair
next
his
mother
who
had
bowed
her
head
on
the
desk
in
front
of
her
she
had
been
writing
a
note
to
a
charitable
society
of
which
she
was
a
member
the
check
she
was
to
send
them
lay
all
signed
ready
to
be
inclosed
whispered
roy
using
the
pet
name
rex
had
invented
and
pressing
one
of
his
hands
tightly
in
his
have
us
we
are
growing
fast
i
am
sure
we
shall
get
you
my
his
mother
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
then
lifted
her
eyes
reverently
as
she
added
and
i
must
not
forget
that
there
is
one
who
is
always
a
friend
to
the
needy
and
now
children
we
must
go
to
bed
we
will
decide
what
to
roy
stopped
at
door
went
in
and
found
his
brother
tossing
in
bed
you
told
the
girls
he
asked
did
they
take
it
than
i
expected
they
what
are
we
going
to
do
roy
rex
went
on
stay
of
course
what
will
people
say
there
be
a
terrible
scandal
talk
that
way
rex
remember
that
you
and
i
are
the
ones
mother
must
depend
on
now
if
she
sees
us
looking
on
the
dark
side
make
it
so
much
the
harder
for
it
returned
rex
is
something
you
must
go
ahead
with
you
lay
it
down
when
you
get
tired
all
right
remember
what
you
say
roy
but
an
awful
come
rex
however
up
to
the
scratch
as
he
himself
would
have
expressed
it
nobly
the
next
day
nobody
went
to
church
and
about
half
past
eleven
the
door
bell
rang
and
darley
and
were
announced
miles
as
we
shall
continue
to
call
him
sent
up
word
to
know
if
he
could
come
up
to
room
you
know
asked
reginald
as
he
met
him
in
the
doorway
sydney
came
around
to
us
this
morning
i
understand
it
but
i
want
you
to
miles
hesitated
it
was
very
embarrassing
for
him
to
express
just
what
he
wanted
to
say
rex
helped
him
out
awfully
glad
for
you
old
fellow
he
said
heartily
i
want
you
to
worry
about
us
get
along
some
that
do
miles
persisted
it
been
for
you
i
might
have
been
a
common
tramp
now
and
never
found
my
if
it
been
for
you
i
would
probably
have
been
dead
long
ago
rex
retorted
you
see
not
and
i
want
that
we
should
till
i
give
you
what
i
think
you
ought
to
have
father
says
i
may
i
mean
if
you
do
that
never
speak
to
you
again
there
take
your
or
my
pride
conquered
miles
was
still
his
slave
never
say
another
word
about
it
rex
he
replied
meekly
and
for
the
first
time
reginald
felt
that
he
could
face
poverty
bravely
chapter
xxxv
a
fistic
encounter
it
is
summer
again
but
in
batemans
the
town
in
which
we
now
find
our
friends
the
pells
this
banner
season
of
the
year
does
not
deck
itself
with
all
the
attractions
that
caused
it
to
be
eagerly
looked
forward
to
in
marley
there
are
no
creek
no
hills
no
trees
nothing
but
board
walks
board
houses
board
fences
and
the
we
take
as
rex
would
conclude
the
sentence
and
these
are
the
same
in
summer
as
they
are
in
winter
except
that
they
are
all
hotter
and
more
unpleasant
than
ordinary
batemans
is
a
far
western
town
a
friend
of
was
putting
up
a
hotel
there
at
the
time
of
her
trouble
he
had
appealed
to
her
for
some
woman
to
run
it
want
a
man
he
wrote
are
too
many
men
out
here
now
i
want
somebody
who
will
give
home
comforts
which
i
want
to
make
a
speciality
of
in
place
of
a
pell
considered
it
a
providential
opportunity
she
replied
stating
that
she
would
take
it
herself
if
she
could
have
her
children
to
help
her
and
they
had
gone
out
there
in
february
darley
had
been
kindness
itself
he
not
only
refused
to
prosecute
sydney
but
wanted
to
settle
a
portion
of
his
fortune
on
the
pells
are
fully
entitled
to
this
he
said
is
through
you
that
my
boy
has
been
restored
to
but
pell
was
firm
as
rex
had
been
firm
is
enough
that
you
allow
us
the
time
in
which
to
make
our
plans
she
returned
rex
never
murmured
at
the
prospect
of
batemans
not
even
when
the
dreary
aspect
of
the
place
with
mud
two
feet
deep
in
its
streets
first
dawned
upon
him
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
rejoice
rather
that
his
new
lot
was
to
be
cast
so
far
away
from
all
his
old
friends
there
were
no
educational
facilities
in
batemans
at
least
none
of
which
the
twins
could
avail
themselves
then
they
found
plenty
to
do
in
helping
their
mother
rex
acted
as
clerk
made
out
the
bills
and
received
the
guests
roy
saw
to
the
purchasing
of
supplies
and
aided
his
brother
in
keeping
objectionable
characters
out
of
the
house
there
were
no
amusements
and
no
society
except
that
which
they
furnished
themselves
in
the
family
circle
roy
often
thought
if
he
had
had
this
life
to
look
forward
to
his
whole
previous
existence
would
have
been
embittered
but
now
that
he
was
living
it
strength
seemed
given
him
in
some
way
to
bear
the
burden
sydney
had
gone
to
england
they
asked
him
to
write
and
let
them
know
how
he
was
getting
along
but
he
would
not
promise
miles
wrote
regularly
to
rex
even
when
the
latter
did
not
reply
he
and
his
father
had
moved
into
the
handsome
home
next
the
with
fox
as
housekeeper
wonder
what
people
think
of
the
thing
rex
said
once
to
roy
there
had
been
no
publicity
about
the
transfer
only
a
few
people
knew
of
it
and
the
cause
on
this
july
day
on
which
we
are
writing
it
was
unusually
hot
the
heat
seemed
to
be
frying
in
the
air
it
was
a
day
of
all
others
on
which
to
keep
quiet
and
calm
but
this
was
the
day
on
which
the
waiters
of
the
homestead
house
had
chosen
to
go
out
on
strike
for
an
increase
of
wages
which
pell
was
not
empowered
to
give
them
they
threw
down
their
aprons
just
before
the
dinner
hour
at
one
mind
mother
said
roy
and
i
will
pitch
in
and
and
they
did
they
and
eva
and
jess
rex
was
just
carrying
a
tray
of
dishes
into
the
pantry
when
he
heard
a
louder
voice
than
usual
coming
from
one
of
the
tables
he
looked
around
he
saw
jess
flushed
to
her
hair
standing
behind
a
young
man
who
had
come
in
with
one
of
the
regular
guests
and
whom
he
had
not
noticed
before
now
give
you
a
nice
tip
if
do
it
for
me
rex
heard
the
fellow
say
he
thought
he
recognized
the
voice
he
put
his
tray
down
and
hurried
to
his
side
she
had
started
to
walk
away
but
the
man
had
caught
her
by
the
dress
and
held
her
fast
wants
me
to
go
to
the
saloon
across
the
street
and
bring
him
a
bottle
of
beer
said
jess
rex
stooped
quickly
and
disengaged
the
hand
with
no
gentle
touch
in
doing
so
he
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
it
was
ashby
stout
scott
little
pell
exclaimed
stout
then
he
added
quickly
here
youngster
what
right
have
you
to
send
that
girl
away
from
here
right
replied
rex
promptly
whistled
stout
under
his
breath
and
he
turned
to
driscoll
the
friend
with
whom
he
had
come
in
sammy
he
whispered
position
does
this
chap
hold
in
the
place
the
son
was
the
reply
having
accomplished
his
purpose
rex
went
on
took
up
his
tray
and
carried
it
into
the
pantry
his
eyes
still
flashed
from
anger
he
said
going
up
to
his
sister
must
not
go
into
that
dining
room
have
to
she
replied
got
lots
of
orders
to
mind
attend
to
yours
and
mine
too
not
going
to
have
that
ruffian
ogling
you
i
know
who
he
do
who
is
he
mind
it
is
enough
that
i
know
everything
bad
about
him
and
nothing
good
give
me
your
and
jess
complied
of
course
this
compelled
rex
to
wait
on
stout
but
he
gritted
his
teeth
and
went
through
with
the
process
in
dignified
silence
taking
no
notice
of
the
attempt
stout
made
to
draw
him
into
conversation
when
dinner
was
over
and
rex
was
back
in
his
place
behind
the
desk
making
up
accounts
stout
strolled
in
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
he
affected
to
be
examining
the
register
for
a
little
while
then
suddenly
looked
up
to
remark
say
pell
a
deuced
pretty
sister
of
i
say
that
rex
did
right
i
say
that
he
did
wrong
but
on
the
instant
and
without
a
word
he
leaned
forward
and
hit
ashby
stout
a
blow
on
the
chin
that
sent
him
staggering
backward
over
a
chair
that
stood
just
behind
him
there
happened
to
be
no
one
else
in
the
office
just
at
that
moment
so
stout
was
obliged
to
pick
himself
up
which
he
did
muttering
wrathfully
under
his
breath
while
rex
very
white
went
on
with
his
work
not
a
coward
sir
come
out
here
and
give
me
satisfaction
for
that
insult
so
spoke
stout
rex
closed
his
books
and
came
out
in
front
of
the
desk
allow
no
one
to
speak
of
my
sister
in
that
tone
he
said
i
allow
no
one
to
strike
me
blustered
stout
launching
out
a
blow
directly
at
face
rex
dodged
and
planted
another
blow
on
chin
then
they
both
went
at
it
sometimes
one
was
struck
sometimes
the
other
i
am
aware
that
this
is
contrary
to
all
precedents
in
story
writing
following
out
these
ashby
stout
should
have
gone
down
under
the
first
blow
and
then
been
glad
to
slink
off
without
risking
another
encounter
with
the
redoubtable
hero
but
then
as
i
think
i
have
remarked
once
before
rex
is
not
the
hero
of
this
story
he
is
a
boy
of
very
impulsive
nature
as
often
wrong
as
right
in
his
motives
perhaps
he
might
have
taken
a
wiser
method
of
standing
up
for
his
sister
on
the
present
occasion
be
this
as
it
may
he
did
not
regret
the
black
eye
he
went
up
to
his
room
to
bathe
a
little
while
later
and
while
the
battle
did
not
result
in
a
decisive
victory
for
either
side
it
was
noticeable
that
ashby
stout
did
not
again
accompany
driscoll
to
the
homestead
but
some
one
else
appeared
the
next
day
to
whom
rex
found
it
necessary
to
explain
how
he
came
by
his
battered
visage
chapter
xxxvi
miles
breaks
the
news
a
compromise
had
been
effected
with
the
striking
waiters
and
the
heat
had
lessened
a
little
in
its
intensity
the
two
things
together
with
the
nonappearance
of
ashby
stout
were
blessings
for
which
rex
had
to
be
grateful
but
when
the
stage
came
in
and
he
recognized
among
the
passengers
miles
darley
and
the
father
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
glad
or
not
they
were
links
connecting
him
with
that
past
life
which
he
was
trying
his
best
to
forget
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
only
by
forgetting
it
and
thus
doing
away
with
the
power
of
contrast
could
he
be
happy
in
the
present
dear
old
fellow
miles
rushed
forward
with
this
exclamation
and
fairly
took
rex
in
his
arms
he
had
grown
much
in
the
past
few
months
and
the
clothes
he
wore
set
off
his
figure
to
great
advantage
say
where
on
earth
did
you
come
from
said
rex
where
in
the
world
are
you
going
to
that
you
should
take
in
this
forsaken
place
polite
sure
laughed
miles
you
imagine
that
batemans
may
be
our
objective
point
because
certain
you
be
interested
in
saw
mills
and
the
only
thing
that
brings
people
i
can
be
interested
in
you
i
rex
missed
you
terribly
that
great
house
seems
so
lonely
with
only
three
of
us
in
you
have
stayed
there
in
the
summer
the
white
mountains
or
the
sea
of
places
you
could
have
gone
we
choose
to
come
here
instead
all
right
it
rex
course
it
is
old
fellow
and
now
i
see
that
the
best
way
in
which
i
can
entertain
you
is
to
tell
you
right
off
how
i
came
by
this
black
eye
which
rex
proceeded
at
once
to
do
for
you
my
little
game
cock
exclaimed
miles
when
he
had
heard
the
story
of
stout
your
friend
harrington
has
tried
to
scrape
acquaintance
with
me
but
he
got
beyond
the
scraping
stage
yet
i
wonder
what
stout
was
doing
out
in
the
lumber
business
i
believe
but
afraid
find
it
pretty
hot
had
so
many
cold
days
in
my
time
i
guess
i
can
stand
a
little
rex
was
not
the
only
one
of
the
pells
who
was
astonished
by
the
advent
of
the
darleys
their
coming
was
a
complete
surprise
to
the
entire
family
and
a
still
greater
cause
of
astonishment
was
the
prolongation
of
their
stay
they
rented
two
of
the
best
rooms
in
the
house
had
awnings
put
up
at
the
windows
and
wicker
furniture
sent
on
from
denver
darley
took
frequent
trips
to
neighboring
towns
it
was
understood
by
the
gossips
at
batemans
that
he
was
a
large
eastern
capitalist
looking
about
for
profitable
mining
investments
july
august
and
half
of
september
passed
and
still
the
darleys
remained
miles
was
supremely
content
for
he
was
with
rex
for
whom
his
admiration
appeared
to
increase
with
each
added
intimacy
miles
had
brought
his
books
and
they
studied
together
some
and
in
spite
of
the
forlornness
of
the
place
the
five
young
people
managed
to
have
a
pretty
good
time
one
afternoon
roy
and
rex
were
washing
the
omnibus
out
at
the
stable
the
driver
hearing
of
a
big
strike
that
had
been
made
at
a
mine
some
sixty
miles
away
threw
up
his
position
at
once
and
started
off
to
try
to
get
rich
at
a
hand
stroke
and
the
boys
were
forced
to
throw
themselves
into
the
breach
until
another
man
could
be
obtained
in
his
place
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
they
had
trained
themselves
to
expect
since
coming
to
batemans
miles
asked
roy
as
he
brought
a
fresh
pail
of
water
and
set
it
down
beside
his
brother
was
coming
out
but
his
father
called
him
into
his
miss
them
when
they
go
we
reggie
it
has
been
jolly
good
fun
to
have
miles
with
us
all
summer
you
ought
to
feel
quite
proud
to
think
you
are
a
strong
enough
magnet
to
keep
him
understand
it
at
all
why
they
should
have
stayed
returned
rex
he
did
not
speak
very
cheerfully
the
darleys
were
to
leave
the
very
next
week
it
was
impossible
but
that
rex
should
realize
vividly
to
what
they
were
returning
he
did
not
tell
roy
so
but
he
wished
they
had
not
come
there
was
only
one
wheel
of
the
omnibus
to
finish
when
miles
came
hurrying
toward
them
there
was
an
expression
on
his
face
which
neither
of
the
twins
could
comprehend
it
was
a
blending
of
fear
joy
and
stupefaction
let
me
help
he
said
as
he
came
up
want
you
fellows
to
hurry
and
get
through
something
to
tell
but
they
had
so
nearly
finished
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
undertake
have
you
got
to
tell
us
asked
rex
throwing
his
sponge
back
into
the
bucket
wish
i
knew
how
you
fellows
would
take
it
returned
miles
a
flush
creeping
over
his
face
us
and
find
out
rejoined
roy
with
a
smile
simply
delighted
myself
went
on
the
other
wonder
how
i
can
keep
my
two
feet
on
the
ground
it
seems
too
good
to
be
why
are
you
in
doubt
how
take
it
said
rex
pleases
you
ought
certainly
to
please
perhaps
this
unexpected
and
altogether
miles
darley
you
are
certainly
the
most
incomprehensible
fellow
this
afternoon
exclaimed
roy
it
about
about
the
pells
and
the
darleys
explained
miles
the
color
still
surging
in
his
cheeks
union
there
is
strength
you
know
you
guessed
it
yet
indeed
we
and
just
you
tell
us
right
out
what
it
is
without
any
more
fooling
and
rex
made
a
playful
dab
at
his
friend
with
the
big
sponge
right
here
goes
then
and
miles
drew
in
his
breath
mother
has
told
my
father
that
she
will
be
darley
and
that
makes
us
brothers
rex
you
see
and
all
going
back
to
philadelphia
you
like
it
miles
checked
himself
suddenly
for
roy
and
rex
stood
staring
at
him
as
if
struck
dumb
too
amazed
to
allow
any
expression
to
appear
on
their
faces
but
it
was
all
true
they
were
to
have
another
test
of
fortune
and
though
its
bringing
about
seemed
in
some
sense
to
deprive
the
boys
of
their
mother
they
knew
that
not
only
was
this
not
so
but
that
they
were
to
gain
a
father
thereby
a
brother
too
forget
that
miles
adds
at
my
side
the
end
