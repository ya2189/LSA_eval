a
hush
fell
on
the
waiting
throng
at
old
john
the
soft
babble
of
modulated
voices
died
suddenly
away
as
from
the
greenery
and
the
daisies
of
the
chancel
a
singer
voice
rose
sweet
and
clear
the
aisles
were
ready
for
the
coming
of
a
bride
feet
and
the
wedding
guests
imprisoned
behind
the
silken
bands
bent
forward
expectantly
to
hear
her
nuptial
song
that
song
as
was
most
meet
breathed
love
and
perfect
trust
when
it
was
finished
there
were
tears
in
many
eyes
women
hearts
are
very
tender
at
weddings
and
the
song
was
in
the
universal
key
in
the
vestibule
other
ears
were
bending
to
catch
the
strains
with
the
first
note
judge
kirtley
raised
his
hand
enjoining
silence
and
the
ushers
and
the
maids
fell
back
leaving
the
old
man
and
his
companion
listening
at
the
door
upon
his
arm
was
margaret
child
of
his
love
though
not
of
his
blood
she
was
the
daughter
of
his
old
friend
who
with
his
dying
breath
had
left
her
to
his
charge
he
had
been
faithful
to
his
trust
he
had
been
to
her
a
father
and
she
coming
into
his
childless
home
had
filled
a
daughter
place
it
would
be
lonely
enough
without
her
but
it
was
not
this
that
filled
his
mind
as
he
listened
to
the
song
he
was
thinking
with
the
sense
of
helplessness
that
comes
to
every
father
to
every
faithful
guardian
at
a
time
like
this
that
he
had
done
all
he
could
his
trust
was
over
a
moment
more
and
he
would
give
her
for
all
time
into
the
keeping
of
another
would
that
other
rise
to
meet
the
trust
this
was
the
question
reiterating
itself
in
his
soul
did
victor
de
jarnette
know
women
hearts
how
strong
they
were
to
bear
how
quick
to
bleed
was
his
a
hand
that
could
be
both
strong
and
gentle
none
other
he
knew
could
safely
guide
this
girl
of
his
margaret
was
and
impetuous
her
capacity
for
sorrow
and
for
joy
had
sometimes
made
him
stand
aghast
victor
de
jarnette
could
make
a
heaven
on
earth
for
her
or
he
did
not
finish
but
involuntarily
he
pressed
close
to
him
the
hand
and
margaret
looked
up
wonderingly
marveling
to
see
his
face
so
stern
there
was
no
shadow
on
her
sky
her
soul
was
in
tune
with
the
singer
rhapsody
the
song
ended
there
was
a
soft
bustle
in
the
vestibule
the
majestic
measures
of
lohengrin
filled
her
ears
the
bridesmaids
shook
out
their
plumage
and
moved
on
the
flower
girls
were
scattering
roses
for
her
path
and
with
uplifted
head
and
shining
eyes
margaret
varnum
went
forward
to
meet
her
lover
in
the
chancel
proud
erect
and
confident
stood
victor
de
jarnette
waiting
for
her
coming
in
his
black
eyes
was
the
triumph
of
possession
there
were
others
in
that
church
who
had
sought
to
win
margaret
varnum
and
he
did
not
forget
it
he
a
devilish
handsome
fellow
whispered
a
young
officer
in
the
south
transept
to
his
companion
yes
was
the
reply
with
the
primary
accent
on
the
adverb
eh
why
does
his
brother
take
part
in
it
asked
pennybacker
of
her
niece
as
best
man
or
usher
or
something
van
dorn
shrugged
her
shapely
shoulders
he
is
opposed
to
it
i
believe
not
to
margaret
especially
but
to
marriage
in
general
i
do
suppose
you
could
persuade
him
to
take
part
in
a
wedding
now
what
is
the
matter
with
the
man
demanded
her
aunt
he
does
look
like
a
crank
what
can
have
given
him
such
a
bias
as
this
her
niece
smiled
enigmatically
modesty
forbids
that
i
should
say
much
on
the
subject
my
dear
aunt
but
there
are
people
who
are
unkind
enough
to
lay
to
your
niece
charge
richard
de
jarnette
change
of
heart
she
certainly
remembers
when
he
held
altogether
different
views
do
you
mean
to
say
maria
oh
no
certainly
not
so
do
look
at
me
like
that
i
am
only
telling
you
what
people
say
ah
there
come
the
bridesmaids
is
that
pink
gown
a
dream
pennybacker
was
looking
past
the
bridal
party
to
the
front
pew
where
sat
victor
de
jarnette
elder
brother
stern
and
unbending
by
his
side
was
a
younger
man
who
spoke
to
him
from
time
to
time
in
a
light
way
as
if
to
cheer
him
but
his
pleasantries
elicited
scant
response
it
was
his
friend
semple
the
two
were
the
sole
occupants
of
the
pew
reserved
for
the
family
of
the
bridegroom
the
de
jarnette
brothers
were
singularly
alone
i
do
believe
it
thought
pennybacker
as
she
studied
the
face
he
does
look
to
me
like
a
man
who
would
lose
his
head
over
maria
poor
thing
as
pretty
as
she
is
some
women
can
make
an
offer
of
marriage
out
of
an
invitation
to
a
and
see
a
love
letter
in
a
note
beginning
dear
madam
still
you
ca
tell
maria
a
pretty
face
and
men
are
great
fools
there
was
not
a
flaw
in
the
matchless
ceremony
which
has
come
down
to
us
as
a
heritage
from
the
ages
not
a
faltering
note
in
either
voice
to
love
and
to
cherish
till
death
us
do
part
this
was
their
plighted
troth
the
church
challenge
rang
out
boldly
if
any
man
can
show
just
cause
why
these
two
persons
may
not
lawfully
be
joined
together
let
him
now
speak
or
else
hereafter
forever
hold
his
peace
a
stillness
fell
upon
the
place
but
no
man
spoke
at
that
most
searching
admonition
i
require
and
charge
you
both
as
ye
will
answer
in
the
dreadful
day
of
judgment
if
either
of
you
know
any
impediment
why
ye
may
not
be
lawfully
joined
together
ye
do
now
confess
it
they
searched
their
souls
but
if
they
found
impediment
it
stood
unconfessed
once
margaret
felt
her
lover
hand
close
suddenly
on
hers
and
then
relax
she
loved
him
for
his
vehemence
and
gave
an
answering
clasp
at
that
moment
those
near
the
door
looked
into
each
other
faces
with
startled
questioning
gaze
and
bent
their
heads
to
listen
no
sound
was
heard
above
the
rector
solemn
monotone
and
the
response
victor
wilt
thou
have
this
woman
to
thy
wedded
wife
the
straining
ears
relaxed
and
gave
heed
to
the
bridegroom
vow
wilt
thou
love
her
comfort
her
honor
and
keep
her
in
sickness
and
in
health
and
forsaking
all
others
keep
thee
only
unto
her
so
long
as
ye
both
shall
live
and
victor
de
jarnette
answered
resonantly
i
will
kneeling
they
asked
god
benediction
on
their
wedded
lives
then
down
the
aisle
in
radiant
happiness
they
led
the
train
one
flesh
if
there
be
aught
in
vows
for
evermore
did
you
hear
anything
during
that
ceremony
asked
john
jarvis
the
lawyer
of
his
wife
as
they
drove
away
she
looked
up
eagerly
yes
did
you
i
thought
i
did
what
was
it
do
you
think
it
sounded
to
me
like
a
knock
yes
and
then
a
cry
faint
but
like
a
woman
voice
they
spoke
in
guarded
tones
but
the
old
carriage
driver
who
had
been
in
the
family
for
twenty
years
and
was
a
privileged
character
heard
and
touched
his
hat
dat
was
a
crazy
woman
miss
de
say
tryin
to
git
in
widout
no
ticket
dey
run
in
yaas
miss
a
knot
of
men
who
had
likewise
heard
the
knock
discussed
it
as
they
walked
toward
pennsylvania
avenue
he
been
wild
said
one
raising
his
brow
and
his
companion
answered
with
easy
tolerance
oh
yes
of
course
but
he
has
sowed
his
wild
oats
and
now
he
is
ready
to
settle
down
a
lady
passing
caught
the
words
and
their
drift
did
you
ever
notice
she
said
thoughtfully
to
her
husband
who
walked
beside
her
that
people
always
say
well
he
has
sowed
his
wild
oats
as
if
that
finished
it
but
in
the
country
where
i
was
born
we
sow
our
oats
and
know
that
we
will
reap
i
imagine
oats
are
not
very
different
from
other
kinds
chapter
ii
the
elder
brother
some
of
him
lived
but
the
most
of
him
died
even
as
you
and
i
for
one
thing
he
is
too
young
said
richard
de
jarnette
at
a
man
is
still
a
boy
unless
he
has
had
more
to
develop
him
than
victor
has
ever
had
and
besides
and
there
he
stopped
it
was
the
evening
after
the
wedding
and
the
two
men
sat
in
the
library
of
richard
de
jarnette
k
street
house
it
had
seemed
rather
a
gloomy
place
until
the
genial
doctor
was
ushered
in
for
when
young
life
goes
out
of
a
home
by
way
of
the
wedding
route
it
leaves
almost
as
great
a
gap
as
if
there
had
been
a
funeral
the
elder
de
jarnette
permitted
himself
few
friends
other
than
those
in
business
circles
and
no
intimates
if
we
may
except
the
one
who
had
come
to
him
guided
by
love
instinct
he
and
semple
had
been
boys
together
in
college
had
had
their
maiden
love
affairs
about
the
same
time
and
had
recovered
from
them
with
about
the
same
expedition
they
knew
each
other
as
the
doctor
was
wont
to
remark
pleasantly
from
the
ground
up
but
the
doctor
even
while
saying
this
was
quite
aware
that
he
did
not
know
richard
de
jarnette
from
the
ground
down
that
is
to
say
to
the
roots
of
his
nature
he
occasionally
came
upon
unexpected
subterranean
passages
in
the
man
character
leading
he
knew
not
whither
for
when
upon
two
or
three
occasions
he
had
attempted
to
explore
these
interesting
byways
he
had
come
suddenly
upon
a
sign
which
said
so
plainly
that
the
wayfaring
man
though
a
fool
might
read
no
trespassing
allowed
and
semple
being
a
wise
man
and
not
a
fool
always
made
haste
to
vacate
when
he
saw
this
legend
he
knew
what
the
rest
of
their
world
knew
that
richard
de
jarnette
was
a
rising
business
man
of
strict
integrity
and
tireless
energy
and
he
knew
what
their
world
did
not
know
that
there
had
been
a
time
when
his
life
had
not
been
bounded
by
the
four
walls
of
his
office
or
the
prim
severity
of
a
home
presided
over
by
a
housekeeper
a
time
when
he
had
had
his
dreams
like
the
rest
then
when
he
had
not
much
more
than
made
his
masculine
début
into
society
he
had
suddenly
dropped
from
its
ranks
and
given
himself
thenceforward
wholly
to
business
there
had
been
some
speculation
about
the
cause
of
this
sudden
lapse
of
interest
even
among
his
male
acquaintances
and
more
of
course
among
those
of
the
sex
which
is
rightly
supposed
to
have
greater
curiosity
upon
these
subjects
but
it
is
a
very
busy
world
broken
ranks
in
any
procession
soon
fill
up
and
nobody
sought
him
out
in
his
seclusion
save
semple
he
had
never
been
a
very
successful
society
man
in
truth
having
few
of
the
social
gifts
which
are
there
more
imperative
than
either
character
or
learning
and
besides
he
had
no
real
love
for
it
and
people
rarely
excel
in
the
thing
to
which
they
are
indifferent
since
his
unceremonious
dropping
out
he
had
devoted
himself
exclusively
to
business
and
his
books
his
one
friend
was
semple
his
one
passion
his
love
for
his
young
who
had
shared
his
home
since
the
death
of
their
father
of
course
that
is
your
real
reason
for
opposing
this
marriage
de
jarnette
said
the
doctor
easily
i
understand
that
you
do
want
him
to
marry
at
all
and
you
know
it
de
jarnette
smiled
grimly
i
admit
it
i
have
made
no
pretence
of
denying
it
to
myself
and
since
you
seem
rather
skilful
at
diagnosis
i
suppose
it
is
not
worth
while
to
deny
it
to
you
the
truth
is
semple
the
explanatory
tone
had
in
it
almost
an
appeal
i
have
looked
out
for
this
boy
welfare
since
the
day
his
face
darkened
the
day
he
so
sorely
needed
it
i
i
suppose
i
have
got
in
the
habit
of
it
you
spoiled
him
there
no
doubt
of
that
agreed
his
companion
cheerfully
but
i
should
think
that
now
you
would
be
glad
to
see
his
future
in
the
hands
of
a
good
woman
like
margaret
varnum
it
is
a
safeguard
dick
one
that
you
and
i
have
availed
ourselves
of
it
is
true
but
still
a
safeguard
i
am
sure
of
it
you
are
sure
of
nothing
where
a
woman
is
concerned
declared
richard
de
jarnette
deliberately
you
may
think
you
are
listening
to
their
protestations
but
you
will
find
out
your
mistake
sooner
or
later
they
are
treacherous
bob
you
cast
your
pearls
before
them
and
when
they
find
they
are
not
diamonds
they
turn
and
rend
you
i
know
them
they
are
not
to
be
trusted
there
are
women
and
women
i
suppose
you
will
agree
that
there
are
several
varieties
of
men
there
is
slyter
for
instance
slyter
is
a
beast
said
de
jarnette
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
he
belongs
to
our
sex
we
ca
disown
him
much
as
we
would
like
to
but
we
would
hardly
wish
to
be
judged
by
him
if
you
belonged
to
my
profession
de
jarnette
you
would
know
women
better
and
do
them
more
justice
i
know
them
know
them
better
than
you
do
at
least
i
know
a
side
of
them
that
you
have
never
seen
because
you
have
never
been
to
school
to
them
semple
threw
his
head
back
and
blew
out
slowly
what
seemed
to
be
an
inexhaustible
volume
of
smoke
every
thought
seemed
concentrated
upon
it
when
the
last
of
it
had
floated
off
into
thin
air
he
remarked
quietly
you
have
never
quite
got
over
it
dick
he
had
deliberately
pushed
aside
the
sign
and
walked
into
the
forbidden
grounds
somewhat
to
his
surprise
for
he
hardly
knew
himself
how
it
would
be
taken
he
found
his
friend
walking
by
his
side
de
jarnette
flipped
the
ash
from
his
cigar
and
then
answered
composedly
i
have
got
over
it
so
entirely
that
the
sight
of
her
causes
no
more
commotion
in
my
breast
than
the
vision
of
the
scrub
lady
who
daily
puts
the
outer
hall
in
order
i
hope
you
are
wasting
no
sympathy
upon
me
i
have
even
any
bitterness
about
it
and
certainly
no
regret
it
has
simply
left
me
with
more
knowledge
of
women
that
is
all
and
that
is
worth
all
it
cost
it
is
what
has
rendered
me
immune
all
these
years
burnt
child
you
know
an
expression
of
curious
relief
came
into
the
physician
face
do
you
know
dick
i
have
always
had
a
lingering
ghost
of
a
fear
now
that
she
is
a
widow
and
it
would
be
possible
do
you
know
that
i
beg
you
will
not
do
me
the
injustice
of
the
thought
do
you
know
semple
the
incomprehensible
thing
about
it
now
to
me
is
that
i
should
ever
have
wasted
love
upon
her
i
have
asked
myself
a
hundred
times
what
it
was
i
thought
i
loved
and
where
it
had
gone
that
is
where
the
sting
of
it
comes
in
it
is
that
she
should
have
thrown
me
over
for
the
old
man
and
his
millions
but
that
i
should
have
known
from
the
first
that
she
was
oh
well
it
is
over
it
is
just
exactly
with
me
as
though
it
had
never
been
except
except
that
i
am
wiser
but
not
better
thought
the
physician
the
trouble
about
these
things
is
that
they
never
leave
a
man
the
same
something
is
always
burned
out
of
him
aloud
he
said
she
is
only
one
woman
dick
a
man
always
has
a
mother
richard
de
jarnette
face
softened
less
than
one
would
suppose
my
mother
was
but
a
name
to
me
he
said
she
died
in
giving
me
birth
i
have
then
by
her
birth
pangs
she
has
made
you
a
debtor
to
all
womankind
interrupted
the
doctor
a
little
sternly
and
if
she
gave
her
life
for
yours
i
do
not
acknowledge
the
indebtedness
his
host
returned
coldly
i
did
not
ask
to
be
brought
into
this
world
now
that
i
am
here
i
can
do
nothing
less
than
try
to
keep
myself
up
but
i
do
not
see
that
i
have
any
special
cause
for
gratitude
to
the
ones
who
imposed
this
responsibility
upon
me
if
your
mother
had
lived
de
jarnette
you
would
have
felt
differently
said
the
doctor
quietly
almost
gently
you
would
have
known
then
as
you
never
can
now
the
breadth
and
depth
of
a
devotion
you
forget
that
my
father
was
thoughtful
enough
to
provide
me
with
a
second
mother
and
since
i
recall
it
perhaps
you
may
remember
the
depth
of
that
mother
devotion
to
child
he
spoke
with
bitterest
satire
i
have
only
heard
rumors
about
it
answered
his
friend
i
tell
you
that
story
a
few
words
will
do
the
mother
that
my
father
gave
me
when
i
was
nine
years
old
set
herself
first
of
all
to
alienate
his
affections
from
me
his
child
and
succeeded
she
would
have
failed
if
he
had
been
your
mother
interjected
the
doctor
in
the
slight
pause
i
am
not
sure
of
that
though
i
mean
no
disrespect
to
a
mother
who
was
buried
too
deep
to
rescue
her
child
from
all
the
indignities
that
woman
heaped
upon
him
i
will
pass
quickly
over
that
semple
to
this
day
it
hurts
me
to
think
of
it
i
have
never
seen
a
man
cruel
to
a
child
since
without
wanting
to
kill
him
and
a
woman
was
it
the
same
after
her
own
child
came
it
was
worse
she
was
jealous
then
in
addition
to
being
vindictive
if
she
had
only
been
cruel
to
me
and
kind
to
him
i
believe
i
could
have
stood
it
for
i
loved
that
boy
as
i
have
loved
few
things
in
life
but
she
was
cruel
to
him
too
she
neglected
him
and
finally
well
you
know
how
it
ended
everybody
knows
the
dishonor
she
brought
on
the
name
of
de
jarnette
that
is
one
thing
i
hate
her
for
from
the
time
she
left
her
child
a
helpless
baby
of
four
years
i
have
had
no
faith
in
it
is
good
to
talk
about
it
sounds
well
it
is
all
right
till
the
test
comes
and
sometimes
the
test
never
does
come
but
if
it
does
they
fly
the
track
every
time
you
ca
depend
on
a
woman
they
are
treacherous
what
effect
did
her
going
away
have
on
your
father
in
his
relations
to
you
i
mean
did
it
bring
his
affections
back
to
you
no
you
would
suppose
it
would
have
had
that
effect
but
it
did
it
made
him
misanthropic
and
hard
he
could
not
bear
victor
in
his
sight
the
child
seemed
to
be
a
constant
reminder
of
the
mother
and
the
disgrace
she
had
brought
upon
him
then
it
was
that
i
got
into
the
habit
of
looking
out
for
him
my
father
was
a
hard
man
an
unforgiving
man
he
ruled
with
a
rod
of
iron
i
taken
many
a
whipping
that
would
have
fallen
upon
victor
small
as
he
was
if
i
had
lied
for
him
perhaps
you
would
have
done
him
better
service
to
have
let
them
fall
upon
him
the
doctor
was
thinking
you
see
how
it
is
bob
that
is
why
he
has
always
seemed
so
close
to
me
i
really
think
of
him
more
as
my
child
than
my
and
that
why
it
hurts
oh
well
if
he
had
only
waited
a
few
years
i
think
i
could
have
consented
to
it
with
a
better
grace
but
my
consent
was
asked
on
his
way
home
semple
looked
at
it
with
a
professional
eye
the
man
has
a
wrong
bias
he
said
at
last
it
was
a
case
of
malpractice
and
it
has
left
him
with
his
nature
out
of
joint
if
he
could
have
a
hard
enough
wrench
in
the
right
hands
it
might
be
but
where
is
the
surgeon
then
he
went
back
to
the
cause
women
are
accountable
for
a
deal
of
evil
in
this
world
and
it
does
all
come
by
generation
as
the
catechism
puts
it
oh
well
chapter
iii
pennybacker
of
missouri
two
or
three
weeks
after
the
wedding
pennybacker
sat
with
her
niece
in
the
elegantly
appointed
library
of
the
mansion
that
old
cornelius
van
dorn
had
left
to
his
bereaved
widow
van
dorn
had
enjoyed
her
crape
and
was
now
in
the
softly
alleviated
stage
of
violet
and
heliotrope
which
looked
so
well
on
her
that
she
was
tempted
to
prolong
indefinitely
this
twilight
of
her
grief
certainly
nothing
could
be
more
bewitching
than
the
lavender
housegown
which
enveloped
her
with
its
falls
and
cascades
of
soft
lace
and
its
coquettish
velvet
bows
she
was
smiling
complacently
just
now
at
this
reflection
in
the
mirror
as
she
leaned
on
the
mantel
no
i
do
believe
i
shall
take
off
my
mourning
for
another
year
she
said
half
aloud
turning
her
head
a
little
to
one
side
to
adjust
a
bow
in
her
hair
at
least
not
quite
then
perhaps
i
shall
have
a
season
of
grays
a
velvet
hat
with
long
feathers
and
a
cut
steel
ornament
soft
shades
are
certainly
becoming
to
me
and
i
dislike
to
see
people
rush
into
colors
immediately
as
if
they
had
no
feeling
at
all
the
widowed
lady
sighed
softly
as
was
her
wont
when
referring
to
her
bereavement
it
seemed
to
go
well
with
lavender
your
love
for
purple
maria
observed
pennybacker
ignoring
the
sentiment
of
these
remarks
and
grasping
promptly
their
salient
point
as
was
her
wont
is
an
inherited
one
your
mother
used
to
feel
when
she
had
on
a
new
purple
calico
or
lawn
that
she
was
about
as
fine
as
they
made
them
and
if
she
could
get
hold
of
a
purple
ribbon
aunt
mary
said
van
dorn
in
polite
exasperation
if
you
have
to
refer
to
those
old
days
and
what
you
wore
why
do
you
speak
of
muslins
and
organdies
instead
of
calicoes
and
such
things
because
they
were
not
muslins
and
organdies
they
were
calicoes
and
lawns
lawns
at
that
and
mighty
glad
we
were
to
get
them
well
ejaculated
van
dorn
in
marked
disgust
i
ca
see
any
good
in
constantly
advertising
the
fact
any
more
than
i
can
see
why
you
should
say
as
you
did
to
congressman
andrews
last
night
that
you
were
from
kingdom
pennybacker
lips
twitched
in
a
reminiscent
smile
i
did
that
to
be
explicit
he
wanted
to
know
what
part
of
callaway
i
was
from
and
i
had
to
tell
him
i
could
dodge
i
was
born
in
kingdom
i
thought
he
seemed
to
enjoy
hearing
about
it
enjoy
it
yes
at
your
expense
i
did
mind
maria
it
started
us
on
a
very
mirthful
talk
you
ought
to
be
thankful
that
i
did
tell
him
you
were
born
there
too
i
do
want
you
ever
to
tell
that
to
anybody
i
am
not
a
missourian
i
am
a
washingtonian
maria
said
pennybacker
firmly
you
are
a
missourian
it
is
too
late
now
for
you
to
select
a
birthplace
if
you
ever
get
into
statuary
hall
which
i
somewhat
doubt
you
will
have
to
be
written
down
from
kingdom
for
there
you
were
born
van
dorn
contented
herself
with
a
sniff
anyway
continued
pennybacker
argumentatively
i
do
see
why
one
would
rather
have
been
born
in
a
great
sovereign
state
like
missouri
an
empire
in
itself
than
in
a
little
two
by
four
asparagus
bed
set
like
a
patch
on
top
of
two
other
states
and
not
set
straight
at
that
i
never
had
any
opinion
of
people
who
are
ashamed
of
their
native
state
even
if
that
was
a
state
of
poverty
and
yours
was
a
state
of
affluence
if
you
call
calico
and
lawn
affluence
began
van
dorn
i
was
speaking
of
the
commonwealth
maria
pennybacker
explained
with
suspicious
mildness
a
state
of
affluence
written
with
a
capital
i
never
even
let
richard
de
jarnette
know
i
was
from
missouri
all
the
time
he
was
coming
to
see
me
i
told
him
my
mother
was
a
virginian
which
was
the
truth
and
that
i
was
a
washingtonian
which
was
oh
i
suppose
so
and
i
have
never
let
one
soul
know
aunt
mary
where
you
are
from
pennybacker
faced
her
you
have
well
if
i
were
not
going
home
i
should
make
a
point
of
telling
every
acquaintance
you
have
do
you
think
i
am
ashamed
of
missouri
i
should
as
soon
think
of
disowning
the
mother
that
bore
me
why
should
you
hesitate
to
tell
de
jarnette
where
you
were
from
i
thought
a
good
deal
about
his
opinion
in
those
days
and
is
he
as
provincial
as
all
that
he
has
always
lived
in
the
east
and
you
know
how
eastern
people
feel
about
the
west
i
know
how
they
feel
but
i
know
how
they
might
feel
if
they
knew
anything
about
it
if
the
world
fair
is
held
in
chicago
i
suspect
it
will
open
their
eyes
to
a
few
things
where
are
these
de
jarnettes
from
it
is
an
old
maryland
family
there
are
just
two
of
them
left
now
richard
and
victor
the
father
died
years
ago
leaving
a
large
estate
to
his
sons
then
richard
is
wealthy
in
his
own
right
his
property
comes
mainly
from
an
aunt
who
did
not
like
victor
mother
no
they
are
only
victor
has
nearly
so
much
money
as
richard
it
turns
out
that
richard
has
so
much
more
than
anybody
ever
supposed
he
had
years
ago
van
dorn
mouth
sank
into
a
slightly
regretful
droop
as
if
the
subject
had
its
stings
maria
you
remind
me
of
a
woman
i
used
to
know
in
missouri
whenever
a
girl
was
married
and
anybody
asked
this
old
lady
how
she
had
done
she
always
said
in
her
slow
drawl
i
really
do
know
how
much
the
man
is
worth
what
is
there
to
these
de
jarnettes
besides
money
i
want
to
know
something
about
margaret
chances
for
happiness
oh
it
is
a
fine
family
she
has
done
well
i
really
think
that
richard
has
shown
himself
sometimes
quite
hard
but
the
two
are
not
at
all
alike
victor
mother
was
a
french
woman
or
of
french
descent
that
is
where
he
gets
his
complexion
i
suppose
and
perhaps
his
morals
for
i
guess
he
has
been
pretty
fast
there
was
an
awful
scandal
about
his
mother
years
ago
i
heard
of
course
richard
never
mentioned
it
to
me
but
i
know
he
hates
her
like
poison
i
think
she
went
off
with
another
man
or
something
like
that
some
dreadful
thing
that
could
be
talked
about
above
your
breath
anyway
she
disappeared
and
never
came
back
left
her
child
and
all
that
the
story
goes
that
she
wanted
to
come
back
after
a
while
but
old
de
jarnette
never
forgave
her
i
think
they
really
are
very
unforgiving
richard
has
proved
so
yes
the
boys
were
raised
by
the
father
and
a
negro
nurse
they
have
a
beautiful
estate
out
here
in
maryland
elmhurst
richard
keeps
it
up
and
stays
out
there
in
the
summer
or
at
least
he
did
when
i
had
an
interest
in
him
which
was
ages
ago
how
old
is
victor
de
jarnette
he
just
came
into
his
money
last
winter
he
is
two
years
older
than
margaret
pennybacker
shook
her
head
too
young
entirely
richard
is
ten
years
older
than
victor
if
she
could
have
got
him
now
but
van
dorn
tossed
her
pretty
head
i
do
believe
anybody
will
ever
capture
richard
de
jarnette
unless
the
sentence
was
unfinished
but
she
looked
demurely
at
the
lavender
reflection
in
the
mirror
opposite
it
is
hard
for
a
woman
to
forget
a
man
who
has
once
been
at
her
feet
after
a
long
silence
pennybacker
who
had
evidently
been
pondering
something
said
abruptly
maria
where
did
you
say
margaret
new
home
was
i
think
i
shall
go
to
see
her
this
afternoon
why
aunt
mary
you
ca
she
is
at
home
until
september
but
i
am
going
away
tomorrow
i
ca
hang
around
here
till
september
and
i
am
an
old
old
friend
of
her
mother
do
you
think
she
would
excuse
the
informality
under
the
circumstances
certainly
not
you
ought
to
think
of
going
very
well
said
pennybacker
perhaps
you
are
right
what
did
you
say
was
her
number
i
may
want
to
write
to
her
some
time
she
acquiesced
in
the
proposed
restriction
of
her
movements
without
further
remonstrance
and
an
hour
later
sallied
forth
address
in
hand
to
find
margaret
de
jarnette
that
always
the
best
way
to
conduct
a
discussion
with
maria
she
said
to
herself
it
saves
time
and
temper
a
fairer
sight
than
washington
in
may
it
would
be
hard
to
find
too
many
of
our
great
cities
are
but
stupendous
aggregations
of
brick
and
mortar
of
flagstones
and
concrete
of
elevators
that
climb
to
dizzy
heights
and
dark
stairways
which
lead
to
a
teeming
most
of
them
if
called
upon
to
give
their
own
biographies
could
do
it
as
tersely
and
as
truthfully
as
did
topsy
and
in
her
immortal
words
i
jes
growed
but
fortunately
the
nation
capital
was
planned
and
wisely
planned
by
a
brain
which
beheld
with
the
eye
of
faith
while
yet
they
were
not
avenues
flung
out
across
the
checkerboard
of
streets
like
ribbons
radiating
in
all
directions
from
that
massive
pile
which
is
to
all
good
americans
in
spite
of
holmes
and
boston
claims
the
true
hub
of
our
special
universe
it
is
these
transverse
avenues
which
make
the
special
beauty
and
distinction
of
the
capital
city
not
in
themselves
alone
but
in
the
miniature
parks
and
triangular
bits
of
greenery
that
they
leave
in
their
wake
it
was
up
massachusetts
avenue
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
them
all
that
pennybacker
wended
her
way
consulting
from
time
to
time
a
card
she
held
in
her
hand
she
stopped
at
last
at
the
door
of
a
gray
stone
house
shaded
by
a
row
of
elms
the
parking
as
they
call
it
is
rather
wide
on
massachusetts
avenue
and
the
lawn
was
green
and
well
kept
there
was
an
air
of
quiet
elegance
about
the
place
that
pleased
pennybacker
the
exterior
is
all
that
can
be
desired
at
any
rate
she
commented
she
sent
up
her
card
and
waited
in
the
parlor
the
boy
returned
to
say
that
de
jarnette
would
be
down
immediately
when
he
was
gone
pennybacker
began
a
close
perusal
so
to
speak
of
her
surroundings
a
beautiful
room
she
announced
to
herself
at
length
a
beautiful
room
for
myself
i
do
know
that
i
like
this
persian
rug
as
well
as
i
would
a
good
body
brussels
that
covered
the
whole
floor
but
that
is
only
my
taste
you
have
to
get
used
to
bare
spots
on
a
floor
before
you
really
appreciate
them
i
suppose
well
if
happiness
lies
in
things
and
i
am
not
surer
of
anything
in
this
world
than
that
it
does
margaret
will
be
very
happy
here
i
wish
i
felt
sure
of
the
sentence
was
unfinished
at
this
moment
a
slight
lithe
figure
ran
swiftly
down
the
stairs
and
fell
upon
her
in
the
most
unceremonious
manner
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
you
are
the
pennybacker
from
missouri
who
was
my
mother
old
friend
are
you
i
have
heard
my
father
speak
of
you
so
often
you
take
a
different
view
of
it
from
my
niece
van
dorn
said
pennybacker
after
the
greetings
were
over
she
said
it
do
at
all
for
me
to
come
in
fact
i
ran
off
to
do
it
i
am
so
glad
you
did
laughed
margaret
i
would
have
missed
your
visit
for
anything
i
wish
you
could
have
been
at
my
wedding
i
was
i
have
made
it
a
point
in
a
long
life
never
to
miss
anything
that
i
can
see
legitimately
and
respectably
my
niece
secured
an
invitation
for
me
i
supposed
you
knew
was
that
for
you
i
remember
van
dorn
asking
permission
to
bring
a
friend
but
i
did
not
dream
that
it
was
anybody
i
ought
to
know
i
live
in
an
obscure
place
pennybacker
explained
and
maria
seems
to
associate
obscurity
with
disreputableness
it
is
one
of
her
little
peculiarities
not
to
wish
it
known
that
she
has
friends
in
missouri
oh
no
i
do
mind
then
dismissing
van
dorn
and
her
peculiarities
you
are
very
much
like
your
mother
my
dear
oh
do
you
think
so
i
am
always
glad
to
be
told
that
although
i
know
so
little
about
her
myself
do
you
think
i
look
like
her
or
is
it
my
manner
pennybacker
scanned
critically
the
bright
face
opposite
both
you
are
taller
i
think
but
you
have
her
supple
grace
i
noticed
it
as
you
ran
down
the
stairs
and
her
animation
i
am
glad
of
that
for
it
was
one
of
her
greatest
charms
margaret
laughed
i
afraid
i
have
too
much
animation
but
i
help
it
you
see
i
feel
things
rather
intensely
my
enjoyment
is
so
real
that
i
do
know
how
to
keep
from
showing
it
i
hope
you
will
never
learn
a
fresh
enthusiasm
about
everything
as
it
comes
and
a
capacity
to
enjoy
are
among
god
best
gifts
to
us
they
have
but
one
drawback
and
that
is
a
corresponding
capacity
for
suffering
said
pennybacker
with
sudden
gravity
as
she
looked
into
the
young
face
those
two
characteristics
often
go
together
but
do
be
afraid
to
enjoy
with
intensity
my
dear
it
is
about
that
as
it
is
with
brilliant
color
you
often
hear
girls
bewail
their
pink
cheeks
but
time
almost
always
tones
it
down
margaret
i
may
call
you
that
may
i
not
it
almost
seems
to
me
that
the
years
have
been
obliterated
and
that
your
mother
is
beside
me
oh
i
want
you
to
call
me
that
it
is
so
lovely
to
see
somebody
that
knew
my
mother
you
always
continued
friends
did
you
nothing
ever
came
between
you
nothing
not
even
death
she
seems
close
to
me
now
as
i
sit
looking
at
you
impulsively
margaret
threw
her
arms
around
her
mother
friend
oh
you
bring
her
closer
to
me
than
she
has
ever
been
in
all
my
life
tell
me
about
her
they
sat
long
together
the
older
woman
living
over
for
the
girl
the
life
of
the
mother
she
had
never
known
her
girlhood
the
marriage
the
brief
wedded
life
and
its
untimely
close
i
love
to
hear
you
tell
about
it
margaret
said
a
tender
light
in
her
eyes
i
have
known
so
little
of
my
mother
somehow
father
never
talked
with
me
much
about
her
i
think
it
hurt
him
to
remember
he
was
very
fond
of
her
pennybacker
said
and
she
of
him
i
never
knew
a
purer
love
match
nor
a
happier
married
life
and
yet
she
had
to
give
it
up
so
soon
oh
pennybacker
it
seems
to
me
the
thing
to
want
to
live
and
have
to
die
i
do
think
anything
could
be
harder
than
that
yes
there
is
something
harder
than
that
margaret
it
is
to
want
to
die
and
have
to
live
margaret
face
expressed
incredulity
her
head
was
thrown
back
with
a
gesture
that
was
habitual
with
her
and
her
eyes
shining
you
are
very
happy
margaret
said
pennybacker
softly
i
do
think
anybody
could
be
happier
it
almost
frightens
me
sometimes
to
think
how
happy
you
see
my
husband
she
said
it
in
the
pretty
hesitating
way
that
young
girls
use
who
have
not
yet
got
accustomed
to
the
word
my
husband
is
so
good
to
me
it
seems
so
blessed
to
have
somebody
tender
care
around
me
all
the
time
i
think
that
is
what
makes
a
woman
love
a
man
do
you
and
then
i
am
so
glad
to
have
a
home
i
have
never
had
a
home
since
father
died
i
mean
to
say
that
they
were
not
everything
to
me
at
judge
kirtley
that
friends
could
be
you
understand
that
but
they
were
not
my
very
own
nor
i
theirs
and
i
had
mourned
for
father
so
had
missed
him
so
desperately
i
thought
of
that
time
when
you
were
speaking
of
a
capacity
for
suffering
but
after
a
while
well
you
know
how
those
things
go
while
i
did
not
forget
him
after
a
while
the
world
did
not
seem
quite
so
black
and
gradually
yes
child
i
know
comes
grief
goes
we
know
not
how
that
is
just
it
exactly
that
is
lowell
is
it
then
when
victor
came
into
my
life
pennybacker
do
you
know
i
think
victor
is
going
to
be
so
much
like
father
in
his
home
i
hope
so
returned
pennybacker
but
the
face
of
the
bridegroom
at
john
rose
before
her
mental
vision
and
her
hope
was
without
the
element
of
faith
pennybacker
do
you
suppose
father
knows
i
hope
he
does
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
tell
you
this
for
fear
you
will
think
me
silly
but
sometimes
when
victor
has
just
gone
has
told
me
for
the
day
and
that
he
will
hurry
back
as
soon
as
he
can
and
all
that
you
know
and
it
rushes
over
me
so
the
blessedness
of
having
a
love
like
his
and
a
dear
home
that
is
to
be
ours
forever
i
am
my
heart
is
so
overflowing
with
joy
that
i
go
to
my
room
and
drop
down
by
the
couch
and
whisper
softly
i
am
so
happy
can
you
hear
me
dearest
she
dashed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
smiled
through
wet
lashes
i
know
it
is
foolish
pennybacker
and
i
ca
see
how
i
came
to
be
telling
it
all
to
you
but
i
feel
as
if
i
want
father
to
know
do
you
think
he
does
i
am
not
much
of
a
spiritualist
margaret
returned
pennybacker
guardedly
the
dye
from
which
my
religious
faith
took
its
color
was
very
blue
but
certainly
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
communion
between
the
living
and
the
dead
or
rather
the
living
here
and
the
living
there
it
would
come
in
answer
to
a
whisper
like
that
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
of
both
the
elder
woman
was
thinking
oh
i
hope
it
will
last
but
she
only
said
you
did
not
take
a
wedding
journey
no
victor
wanted
me
to
go
abroad
but
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
going
anywhere
just
at
first
i
was
so
eager
to
get
things
arranged
in
our
home
we
had
so
many
pretty
bridal
gifts
that
i
was
just
crazy
to
see
how
they
would
look
i
felt
that
i
would
rather
fix
up
this
home
than
do
anything
in
the
world
then
too
i
hated
to
go
away
at
this
time
of
the
year
of
course
we
will
go
later
but
may
is
so
beautiful
in
washington
yes
pennybacker
said
softly
with
all
her
practicality
and
candid
speech
there
was
an
unworked
vein
of
sentiment
about
her
yes
may
is
beautiful
everywhere
even
in
life
calendar
it
did
seem
that
in
that
home
there
was
not
one
thing
lacking
everything
was
there
that
heart
could
desire
taste
suggest
or
money
secure
and
the
mistress
pride
and
joy
in
it
all
were
so
spontaneous
so
exuberant
her
realization
of
the
blessedness
of
her
new
life
so
vivid
that
only
a
croaker
or
a
keen
student
of
human
life
would
have
had
a
thought
of
the
transitory
nature
of
all
things
and
yet
by
an
impulse
for
which
she
herself
could
not
account
pennybacker
turned
again
to
the
girl
to
whom
she
had
said
and
took
both
her
hands
my
dear
she
said
my
home
is
in
an
obscure
spot
one
can
hardly
find
it
on
the
map
but
for
you
its
doors
are
always
open
if
you
ever
need
a
friend
come
to
me
how
queer
mused
margaret
when
she
was
gone
i
wonder
how
she
came
to
say
that
well
with
all
her
oddity
i
like
her
chapter
iv
the
thorn
road
certainly
there
was
nothing
on
margaret
de
jarnette
horizon
at
present
that
was
a
forecast
of
falling
weather
the
skies
were
blue
the
air
clear
and
over
all
the
sunshine
of
love
and
trust
which
was
starting
every
plant
in
her
home
garden
to
budding
the
program
agreed
upon
in
those
days
was
carried
out
and
while
friends
were
wondering
where
the
two
had
gone
for
their
wedding
journey
they
were
quietly
settling
themselves
in
their
new
home
and
into
each
lives
to
margaret
the
place
on
massachusetts
avenue
was
the
house
beautiful
the
instinct
was
strong
within
her
and
she
took
a
delight
in
fashioning
her
nest
if
victor
pleasure
in
it
all
did
not
seem
so
keen
as
hers
she
did
not
perceive
it
when
he
came
at
night
she
flitted
from
one
room
to
another
convoying
him
along
to
show
him
how
this
straw
had
been
changed
and
this
wisp
of
hay
added
and
as
he
looked
and
listened
she
did
not
doubt
that
it
was
together
they
were
building
their
nest
the
evenings
of
that
matchless
may
and
june
were
full
of
peaceful
joy
long
drives
through
rock
creek
park
or
the
beautiful
winding
ways
of
the
soldiers
home
with
now
and
then
a
row
upon
the
river
past
old
georgetown
with
its
windows
blinking
at
the
setting
sun
and
back
again
when
it
lay
steeped
in
moonlight
and
they
floated
lazily
down
toward
the
monument
which
dominated
the
landscape
whichever
way
they
turned
heeding
not
time
nor
aught
else
so
that
only
they
were
together
and
away
from
all
the
world
ah
it
was
idyllic
while
it
lasted
but
it
palled
at
last
the
least
bit
upon
victor
and
then
they
sought
the
seashore
margaret
saying
to
herself
that
it
was
her
choice
to
go
at
the
seashore
as
it
chanced
there
was
a
gay
crowd
from
baltimore
that
victor
knew
and
things
gave
promise
of
being
very
pleasant
but
unfortunately
margaret
was
not
well
when
they
first
reached
the
place
nor
for
some
time
afterwards
not
ill
enough
to
hinder
victor
going
as
she
insisted
earnestly
but
in
a
way
that
kept
her
quiet
upon
the
hotel
piazza
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
take
the
jaunts
the
others
enjoyed
victor
demurred
at
first
saying
he
would
not
think
of
leaving
her
but
it
was
a
very
pleasant
party
and
men
are
always
in
demand
at
seaside
resorts
so
in
the
end
he
went
the
baltimore
party
was
not
going
to
remain
long
and
they
made
hay
with
a
zest
that
was
fatiguing
to
one
not
quite
robust
one
morning
as
margaret
sat
on
the
piazza
watching
the
waves
roll
in
and
back
in
and
back
with
a
ceaseless
energy
that
somehow
seemed
so
futile
always
trying
to
do
something
but
never
accomplishing
it
victor
came
out
from
the
and
threw
himself
at
her
feet
on
the
steps
how
are
you
feeling
by
this
time
sweetheart
he
asked
with
a
tenderness
that
somehow
seemed
to
belong
to
washington
and
the
maytime
rather
than
this
crowded
summer
hotel
it
brought
quick
tears
to
her
eyes
the
girl
was
very
weak
rather
better
thank
you
she
said
smiling
down
at
him
in
a
languid
way
that
belied
her
words
it
is
deucedly
unfortunate
about
your
having
this
little
attack
just
now
he
said
fanning
himself
with
his
hat
and
frowning
a
little
he
was
very
young
you
are
losing
so
many
good
times
i
am
living
on
the
memory
of
our
good
times
in
washington
margaret
said
which
was
truer
than
she
knew
oh
they
were
all
right
were
they
we
did
have
a
good
time
it
a
pity
that
kind
of
thing
ca
last
but
you
see
if
you
felt
equal
to
it
you
could
have
some
good
times
now
of
a
different
sort
dillingham
wants
us
to
go
on
a
yachting
trip
when
margaret
asked
it
rather
listlessly
it
going
to
be
an
awfully
jolly
party
they
are
going
for
an
trip
luncheon
on
the
yacht
and
all
that
how
do
you
feel
about
it
victor
i
could
not
possibly
go
i
am
not
well
enough
he
bit
his
lip
and
looked
annoyed
but
i
should
not
want
to
interfere
with
your
going
she
said
quickly
noticing
the
look
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
oh
no
i
stay
of
course
he
replied
i
could
go
off
for
a
good
time
and
leave
you
here
sick
it
would
be
right
but
it
is
unfortunate
as
i
was
saying
you
know
i
am
specially
fond
of
yachting
and
and
i
want
you
to
go
i
really
would
much
rather
you
would
he
made
some
faint
opposition
which
only
stimulated
her
determination
that
he
should
take
the
trip
at
last
he
said
well
i
know
perhaps
i
will
after
all
just
to
please
dillingham
he
was
anxious
that
i
should
go
to
even
up
the
party
and
margaret
thought
quickly
then
they
did
not
even
expect
me
to
go
you
are
sure
you
wo
be
lonely
without
anybody
to
talk
to
i
will
let
the
sea
talk
to
me
margaret
said
the
sea
talked
to
her
a
good
deal
that
summer
when
the
baltimore
party
was
gone
and
she
was
well
enough
to
go
about
victor
had
formed
the
acquaintance
of
certain
gentlemen
who
were
fond
of
cards
and
pool
and
she
had
many
leisure
hours
for
communion
with
it
what
it
told
her
she
never
repeated
if
she
said
anything
to
it
in
reply
it
was
with
silent
speech
until
one
day
as
she
stood
looking
out
over
its
lonely
wastes
she
suddenly
clasped
her
hands
and
pressed
them
to
her
breast
whispering
brokenly
he
is
so
from
father
they
went
back
in
september
margaret
gladly
in
their
own
home
they
would
fall
back
into
the
blissful
life
that
had
been
theirs
at
first
somehow
it
seemed
to
be
slipping
away
from
them
a
hotel
was
no
place
to
live
when
they
were
at
home
again
she
would
try
hard
to
get
it
back
why
should
her
husband
be
less
thoughtful
less
tender
of
her
now
than
then
now
when
she
needed
it
more
she
had
heard
of
married
people
growing
apart
even
when
there
seemed
to
be
no
special
trouble
between
them
oh
how
wretched
that
would
be
how
intolerable
they
must
not
do
that
she
would
make
his
home
bright
and
attractive
she
had
read
that
it
was
always
a
woman
fault
if
her
husband
interest
waned
it
was
because
she
did
not
meet
him
at
the
door
with
a
smile
and
have
his
slippers
warming
on
the
hearth
and
wear
a
white
dress
with
a
red
rose
at
the
belt
and
another
in
her
hair
but
then
one
could
hardly
remember
all
the
things
the
books
said
women
must
do
to
hold
the
love
their
husbands
had
poured
out
upon
them
so
unstintedly
before
marriage
one
cold
wet
disagreeable
night
in
october
margaret
had
a
fire
lighted
in
the
library
grate
it
was
the
first
one
on
their
own
hearth
and
she
had
not
yet
got
over
the
charm
of
first
things
it
seemed
to
her
when
they
came
into
the
room
that
she
had
never
seen
a
sweeter
more
attractive
place
do
you
remember
what
holmes
says
his
idea
of
comfort
is
she
asked
turning
to
victor
brightly
as
they
sat
down
before
the
glowing
coals
no
what
is
it
feet
on
a
fender
is
that
epigrammatic
and
and
full
of
tenderness
it
is
epigrammatic
all
right
i
ca
quite
see
the
tenderness
you
will
have
to
explain
she
shook
her
head
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
there
are
some
things
that
ca
be
explained
victor
the
humor
of
a
joke
for
instance
if
you
do
see
it
it
is
there
for
you
somehow
her
reply
embarrassed
him
he
felt
that
he
had
been
weighed
in
the
balance
and
found
wanting
and
he
could
not
see
why
you
quote
holmes
a
good
deal
do
you
yes
he
says
such
bright
things
and
she
added
eagerly
victor
let
us
read
some
together
this
winter
father
and
i
used
to
have
such
good
times
reading
together
victor
put
up
his
hand
as
if
to
ward
off
an
attack
really
margaret
do
you
think
you
are
asking
a
little
too
much
of
me
to
settle
down
to
evenings
of
reading
the
autocrat
if
you
would
suggest
having
some
people
in
to
play
cards
now
very
well
she
returned
quietly
we
will
have
some
people
in
to
play
cards
then
i
am
afraid
i
ca
count
upon
all
my
evenings
he
said
hastily
i
find
that
things
have
accumulated
in
my
absence
and
i
will
have
to
be
at
the
office
occasionally
at
night
not
often
but
sometimes
i
should
not
want
to
interfere
with
your
business
victor
but
well
what
the
rest
of
it
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
men
i
have
known
best
have
been
able
to
work
enough
in
the
day
and
give
their
evenings
to
their
families
she
paused
a
moment
during
which
she
thought
i
certainly
have
a
right
to
say
this
and
it
ought
to
be
said
i
am
not
complaining
we
ought
to
plan
out
our
life
together
aloud
she
continued
that
has
always
seemed
to
me
the
right
way
i
think
so
much
depends
now
upon
our
starting
right
he
rose
hastily
we
will
talk
that
over
some
other
time
i
really
have
to
go
down
i
have
promised
to
meet
a
man
you
do
object
you
will
not
be
afraid
i
shall
not
be
afraid
she
said
she
went
to
the
door
with
him
and
stood
looking
after
him
until
he
disappeared
when
she
came
back
she
was
shivering
a
little
she
sat
before
the
fire
and
looked
into
its
depths
then
she
raised
the
skirt
of
her
dainty
and
rested
her
slippered
feet
on
the
brass
that
was
burnished
until
it
shone
feet
on
a
fender
she
said
with
a
dreary
little
smile
she
reasoned
with
herself
afterwards
it
may
not
be
the
best
way
to
do
to
live
she
told
herself
but
i
hope
i
am
womanly
enough
not
to
be
jealous
of
my
husband
business
some
months
later
kirtley
remarked
to
her
husband
victor
de
jarnette
must
be
doing
very
well
in
his
business
margaret
tells
me
that
he
has
to
go
to
the
office
almost
every
night
of
late
there
is
such
a
rush
of
work
poor
child
she
is
not
well
and
is
nervous
at
being
alone
though
she
is
very
brave
about
it
i
think
he
should
be
at
home
more
just
now
a
man
of
his
means
even
if
he
has
to
sacrifice
his
business
somewhat
i
hope
he
will
not
become
too
mercenary
i
hardly
think
he
will
the
judge
responded
dryly
but
with
the
loyalty
of
one
man
for
another
even
when
that
other
is
unworthy
he
said
no
more
inwardly
he
was
groaning
just
as
i
feared
too
bad
that
young
man
had
a
good
case
and
he
is
letting
it
go
by
default
margaret
is
not
the
woman
to
stand
this
when
she
finds
out
it
is
an
evil
hour
for
a
man
when
a
woman
takes
to
her
hungry
heart
a
substitute
for
the
affection
he
withholds
but
when
the
thing
substituted
is
an
innocent
thing
it
is
a
godsend
to
the
woman
a
plant
if
denied
the
light
on
one
side
will
turn
this
way
and
that
when
it
can
not
get
it
in
any
direction
it
dies
as
the
months
went
by
margaret
passed
through
deep
and
changing
experiences
first
there
was
a
period
of
bewilderment
what
had
she
done
that
should
make
this
difference
in
victor
he
had
been
her
persistent
wooer
before
marriage
was
the
case
now
to
be
reversed
her
pride
revolted
but
her
instinct
told
her
that
if
the
fire
on
their
domestic
altar
was
not
to
die
out
she
would
be
the
one
to
fan
the
flame
she
deliberately
and
with
purpose
aforethought
set
herself
to
hold
her
husband
love
it
seemed
to
her
almost
humiliating
that
she
should
have
to
fight
this
fight
but
how
could
she
bear
a
loveless
home
that
she
was
only
in
part
successful
she
could
not
fail
to
see
the
plain
truth
being
that
victor
de
jarnette
was
restive
under
the
bonds
that
bound
him
to
one
woman
and
a
home
being
of
that
masculine
type
which
desires
the
pleasures
of
the
married
state
and
the
liberty
of
bachelorhood
he
did
not
intend
to
be
unkind
but
he
intended
to
have
his
liberty
and
the
two
involved
a
nice
adjustment
that
as
yet
margaret
had
not
learned
to
comprehend
to
this
period
of
bewilderment
and
baffled
endeavor
succeeded
one
of
apathy
her
sensibilities
seemed
blunted
what
was
at
first
a
sharp
intolerable
pain
became
later
a
dull
ache
nothing
seemed
to
matter
much
kirtley
was
concerned
and
told
her
she
needed
a
tonic
but
margaret
shook
her
head
it
was
a
comfort
anyway
to
find
that
she
did
not
care
as
much
as
she
did
at
first
that
she
told
herself
would
have
been
unbearable
that
would
have
been
against
nature
perhaps
she
would
get
so
after
a
while
that
she
would
not
care
at
all
she
had
seen
some
married
people
who
appeared
entirely
indifferent
to
each
other
the
woman
led
her
life
and
the
man
his
and
yet
they
got
along
at
least
respectably
after
all
she
thought
with
a
slight
shiver
it
must
be
a
gray
life
she
had
not
thought
that
hers
would
be
like
that
perhaps
it
was
just
her
physical
lassitude
that
made
her
feel
so
dead
she
lay
hours
at
a
time
on
the
couch
when
victor
was
gone
thinking
nothing
feeling
nothing
hoping
nothing
then
one
day
a
beautiful
thing
happened
to
margaret
a
soft
wind
rose
that
blew
away
the
deadly
miasma
fastening
upon
her
it
stirred
within
the
closed
chambers
of
her
heart
making
them
sweet
and
pure
again
and
softly
fanning
open
others
that
she
had
not
known
were
there
and
from
these
unsuspected
chambers
came
soft
voices
whispering
to
her
of
hope
that
was
not
dead
they
told
her
it
would
spring
again
and
a
sweet
tale
of
joy
that
was
to
be
something
so
untried
so
mysterious
that
the
very
thought
thrilled
her
as
in
all
her
life
she
had
never
been
thrilled
before
then
as
she
bent
to
listen
the
soft
whisperings
swelled
to
sweetest
music
and
a
heavenly
chorus
sang
blessed
blessed
blessed
art
thou
and
margaret
listening
with
rapt
ear
cried
out
in
ecstasy
from
the
great
deeps
of
her
lonely
heart
my
own
my
very
own
and
then
upon
her
knees
took
up
the
great
antiphonal
my
soul
doth
magnify
the
lord
ah
the
angel
of
the
annunciation
had
spoken
to
margaret
and
her
heart
was
singing
the
magnificat
chapter
v
a
white
life
for
two
months
came
and
went
months
in
which
they
each
tried
intermittently
to
regain
their
old
footing
of
love
and
faith
they
could
not
do
it
the
wife
at
least
knew
that
they
were
drifting
apart
she
wondered
sometimes
where
it
would
all
end
victor
had
told
margaret
one
morning
that
he
had
been
called
to
philadelphia
on
business
and
would
not
be
at
home
for
several
days
perhaps
a
friend
called
for
her
that
afternoon
to
drive
she
did
not
go
out
often
now
and
of
course
victor
had
no
thought
that
she
would
take
this
time
of
all
times
she
came
upon
him
in
rock
creek
park
he
too
was
driving
and
beside
him
was
a
woman
she
had
heard
lightly
spoken
of
he
did
not
see
her
nor
did
the
friend
see
him
it
was
but
a
moment
but
in
that
brief
space
she
had
pressed
to
her
lips
the
fruit
plucked
from
the
tree
of
knowledge
margaret
wondered
as
she
felt
the
world
swim
around
her
what
it
was
her
friend
was
saying
and
what
made
it
sound
so
far
off
and
whether
she
would
know
enough
to
answer
her
they
had
a
bitter
time
over
that
he
first
denied
then
attempted
to
explain
and
finally
fell
back
upon
her
foolish
jealousy
forgetting
that
it
is
a
poor
bloodless
type
of
woman
that
will
not
be
jealous
when
occasion
exists
from
that
time
on
she
had
been
steering
wildly
her
rudder
gone
the
storm
fell
on
her
with
as
little
warning
the
winter
passed
spring
came
it
was
almost
mayday
and
her
anniversary
victor
had
seemed
more
thoughtful
of
her
of
late
perhaps
her
weakness
appealed
even
to
him
soon
soon
she
told
herself
they
would
be
drawn
closer
together
by
their
common
joy
and
care
in
the
afternoon
she
was
called
to
the
telephone
it
was
her
de
jarnette
who
was
speaking
he
called
her
up
to
say
that
victor
would
not
be
home
to
dinner
and
perhaps
not
until
quite
late
he
had
had
to
go
to
baltimore
upon
a
business
matter
that
could
not
be
postponed
and
he
had
just
had
a
message
from
him
saying
that
he
richard
would
have
to
come
over
too
in
order
to
make
the
deal
go
through
there
was
a
possibility
a
bare
possibility
that
they
might
not
be
able
to
get
through
in
time
to
get
back
that
night
but
in
that
case
victor
would
telegraph
her
along
in
the
afternoon
he
was
telling
her
about
it
now
so
that
if
the
telegram
came
she
would
not
feel
alarmed
perhaps
she
had
better
telephone
to
judge
and
kirtley
to
come
over
and
stay
with
her
until
victor
got
back
oh
no
she
replied
she
would
not
be
at
all
afraid
she
sat
down
thinking
with
a
sudden
pang
how
strange
it
would
seem
to
have
somebody
looking
out
for
her
comfort
all
the
time
victor
often
stayed
out
as
late
as
that
suddenly
she
felt
appalled
to
perceive
how
certain
she
felt
that
this
was
the
truth
she
had
not
even
questioned
it
margaret
did
not
know
her
very
well
he
had
been
to
the
house
a
few
times
but
always
in
a
perfunctory
way
she
felt
that
he
would
have
prevented
the
marriage
if
he
could
and
this
had
always
stood
between
them
his
considerate
thoughtfulness
of
her
was
most
unexpected
toward
night
the
telegram
came
margaret
opened
it
without
looking
at
the
address
she
stared
at
it
uncomprehendingly
at
first
it
was
signed
by
the
woman
she
had
seen
in
rock
creek
park
and
it
should
have
gone
to
the
office
when
victor
de
jarnette
got
home
in
the
early
evening
his
wife
was
waiting
for
him
with
the
telegram
in
her
hand
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
narrative
to
give
that
interview
there
were
pointed
questions
and
evasive
answers
there
were
criminations
and
recriminations
on
one
side
and
shuffling
prevarication
and
finally
defiance
on
the
other
women
expect
too
much
victor
said
harshly
at
last
if
they
demanded
less
they
would
get
more
i
am
not
speaking
of
women
nor
of
unreasonable
demands
she
said
perhaps
they
do
i
do
know
but
victor
margaret
spoke
with
impassioned
pleading
ask
only
the
same
fidelity
i
give
is
that
too
much
she
faced
him
squarely
with
the
question
her
eyes
burning
into
his
very
soul
only
the
clock
tick
broke
the
silence
upon
his
answer
in
word
and
deed
hung
the
destiny
of
his
life
and
hers
of
his
home
and
hers
of
his
child
his
unborn
child
and
hers
is
that
too
much
she
repeated
he
temporized
it
is
more
than
most
women
get
i
can
tell
you
that
do
put
me
off
is
it
more
than
i
will
get
her
breast
was
heaving
and
her
breath
coming
hard
oh
margaret
do
go
into
heroics
he
cried
listen
to
reason
men
ca
be
bound
down
by
a
woman
code
of
morals
they
never
have
been
and
they
never
will
be
and
women
might
as
well
understand
it
then
marriage
is
a
lie
and
a
cheat
she
cried
with
vehemence
you
take
the
same
vows
that
we
do
and
you
take
them
saying
to
yourselves
that
you
will
keep
them
only
so
long
as
you
chose
and
will
break
them
at
your
will
but
we
poor
fools
we
speak
those
vows
with
bated
breath
and
souls
bared
before
god
and
mean
to
keep
them
strive
to
keep
them
even
when
is
it
such
a
struggle
he
asked
even
when
faith
in
you
is
dead
or
dying
yes
it
is
a
struggle
then
honor
and
obey
bah
well
he
said
stung
by
her
scorn
but
carrying
it
off
insolently
in
the
words
of
the
illustrious
tweed
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
had
he
been
man
enough
perhaps
even
had
he
been
old
enough
he
would
have
thought
of
the
danger
to
her
in
all
this
tumult
of
feeling
and
calmed
her
by
a
candid
meeting
of
the
question
she
had
forced
upon
him
but
he
maddened
her
with
his
flippant
manner
and
contemptuous
words
and
a
change
was
going
on
in
him
too
under
his
light
demeanor
his
anger
was
rising
there
was
bad
blood
in
victor
de
jarnette
false
cowardly
blood
and
it
was
beginning
to
assert
itself
i
am
going
to
do
this
she
said
in
a
low
concentrated
tone
i
demand
to
know
what
this
woman
is
to
you
i
have
a
right
to
know
and
know
you
shall
he
answered
meeting
her
gaze
with
defiant
eyes
in
which
every
evil
passion
had
burst
into
flame
since
i
am
to
be
badgered
and
run
to
earth
in
my
own
home
know
that
she
is
a
woman
i
love
and
shall
love
one
that
i
shall
go
to
when
and
where
and
as
i
please
the
de
jarnettes
are
not
ruled
by
their
women
then
choose
between
us
she
said
with
whitening
lips
for
i
swear
to
you
by
the
living
god
i
will
be
all
or
nothing
to
the
man
that
calls
me
wife
they
stood
facing
each
other
her
features
white
and
drawn
his
inflamed
with
passion
then
with
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
a
frightened
sense
of
her
own
helplessness
perhaps
or
possibly
a
surging
back
of
her
old
love
for
women
are
strange
beings
she
came
closer
to
him
and
stretched
out
her
hands
victor
oh
victor
he
thrust
her
aside
and
went
out
the
door
clanged
behind
him
waking
echoes
in
the
silent
house
and
margaret
suddenly
strengthless
dropped
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
her
face
buried
in
the
couch
she
sat
there
long
with
hopeless
eyes
staring
into
the
blackness
of
the
morrow
saying
now
and
then
brokenly
father
father
white
now
with
anger
furious
at
margaret
discovery
of
his
falseness
and
yet
more
furious
at
the
necessity
which
her
ultimatum
laid
upon
him
to
amend
his
ways
or
lose
his
wife
unholy
passion
for
her
rival
hot
within
him
and
the
vengeful
blood
of
his
race
coursing
tumultuously
through
his
veins
victor
de
jarnette
strode
down
massachusetts
avenue
almost
a
madman
not
for
him
was
the
soft
beauty
of
the
night
the
breath
of
flowers
the
light
of
stars
the
play
of
summer
breezes
among
the
leaves
his
heart
was
closed
to
the
sweet
influences
of
the
pleiades
that
heart
alas
out
of
which
are
the
issues
of
life
had
become
a
seething
cauldron
of
fierce
passions
he
did
not
go
immediately
to
his
office
in
fact
it
was
hours
before
he
did
when
at
last
he
reached
the
place
he
began
tearing
up
letters
and
clearing
up
his
desk
with
one
eye
on
the
clock
as
if
in
preparation
for
departure
or
a
new
incumbent
his
blood
was
still
at
fever
heat
and
his
thoughts
did
not
tend
to
cool
it
besides
the
law
of
heredity
was
against
him
what
he
was
doing
his
mother
before
him
had
done
she
too
had
felt
this
hot
surging
in
the
veins
and
had
given
it
free
course
a
fearful
heritage
is
ungoverned
blood
as
he
opened
a
drawer
to
put
away
some
papers
his
eye
fell
on
a
folded
document
he
looked
at
it
absently
at
first
hardly
aware
that
he
saw
it
then
as
the
innocent
looking
thing
forced
itself
upon
his
consciousness
he
took
it
up
and
read
it
how
well
he
remembered
the
day
it
was
written
a
sneer
curved
his
lips
at
the
thought
of
his
ecstatic
state
of
mind
at
that
time
fool
then
as
he
looked
at
the
paper
there
suddenly
leaped
into
his
mind
a
cruel
thought
and
into
his
face
the
quick
reflection
of
its
malevolence
he
stared
at
the
thing
he
held
i
do
it
he
cried
bringing
his
clenched
hand
down
upon
the
table
with
an
oath
i
show
her
do
do
it
victor
pleaded
john
jarvis
the
lawyer
a
half
hour
later
when
his
angry
client
had
made
his
wishes
known
do
do
it
my
god
man
it
would
be
too
cruel
too
brutally
cruel
brutal
or
not
swore
victor
de
jarnette
according
to
the
laws
of
this
district
i
can
do
it
and
by
god
i
will
wait
till
urged
the
lawyer
you
will
think
better
of
it
in
the
morning
there
may
never
be
a
victor
answered
recklessly
make
sure
of
it
now
if
you
wo
do
it
i
can
get
somebody
that
will
before
he
left
the
attorney
office
it
was
done
and
done
alas
in
due
and
proper
form
chapter
vi
a
friend
in
need
when
margaret
woke
next
morning
it
was
with
a
bewildered
sense
of
something
wrong
the
dull
ache
we
have
in
the
gray
dawn
before
returning
consciousness
brings
it
all
back
to
us
and
makes
it
a
sharp
pain
then
as
the
events
of
the
night
before
came
back
and
the
dread
of
forced
itself
upon
her
she
closed
her
eyes
in
a
sick
longing
to
go
to
sleep
and
never
wake
this
was
the
end
they
had
had
words
bitter
words
before
but
never
like
this
how
could
she
forget
his
cruel
thrusts
his
broken
faith
which
he
had
even
flaunted
in
her
face
how
could
the
barrier
between
them
which
her
passionate
challenge
had
raised
be
broken
down
she
must
be
all
or
nothing
yes
and
it
was
true
as
true
as
it
was
yesterday
and
would
be
for
all
time
only
his
hand
could
break
that
barrier
down
and
suppose
he
would
not
well
so
be
it
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
heart
was
numbed
and
could
never
be
warmed
into
life
again
there
rose
before
her
a
picture
she
had
seen
one
day
a
man
with
wretched
face
a
woman
who
had
cast
herself
on
a
couch
in
an
attitude
suggesting
the
abandon
of
despair
and
between
them
on
the
table
a
still
form
that
she
thought
at
first
glance
was
their
dead
baby
only
that
she
saw
the
wings
and
knew
that
it
was
love
dead
love
it
was
very
late
when
she
had
gone
to
bed
the
night
before
and
still
victor
had
not
come
she
had
fallen
immediately
into
the
deep
sleep
of
exhaustion
which
comes
to
us
sometimes
when
a
crisis
is
past
even
though
it
has
brought
the
worst
women
who
hang
sleepless
and
over
a
have
been
known
to
fall
into
a
sleep
like
that
of
death
when
all
is
over
their
wild
grief
swallowed
up
in
nature
merciful
oblivion
so
it
had
been
with
margaret
had
he
come
in
while
she
slept
she
stepped
to
her
husband
door
and
peeped
cautiously
in
the
bed
was
undisturbed
she
went
back
to
her
own
room
and
stood
there
shaking
as
with
an
ague
what
did
it
mean
then
she
sat
down
and
thought
thought
deeply
going
over
all
the
wretched
quarrel
trying
to
judge
between
them
to
see
where
if
anywhere
he
was
right
and
she
was
wrong
she
had
been
passionate
yes
and
had
said
bitter
things
but
they
were
true
and
she
told
herself
despairingly
it
was
not
the
things
they
the
trouble
lay
back
of
that
if
only
it
had
been
something
else
but
this
oh
how
could
she
compromise
the
words
of
that
odious
bomprey
came
to
her
men
are
naughty
creatures
my
dear
wise
women
learn
to
shut
their
eyes
why
must
they
shut
their
eyes
she
asked
fiercely
the
very
insinuation
was
dishonoring
to
both
but
was
the
woman
right
were
all
men
like
this
her
soul
grew
sick
then
no
no
she
told
herself
in
passionate
protest
it
was
not
true
she
would
not
believe
this
withering
blasting
thing
there
was
her
father
though
all
the
world
should
rise
up
and
say
there
was
no
truth
in
men
she
still
would
know
there
was
her
father
at
breakfast
she
said
quietly
de
jarnette
is
not
at
home
this
morning
we
will
not
wait
he
has
been
called
away
and
may
not
be
home
for
several
days
all
this
with
no
surprise
at
her
own
power
to
lie
without
compunction
when
the
meal
was
over
she
waited
to
give
directions
to
the
servants
as
usual
speaking
cheerfully
to
all
she
could
not
bear
the
pity
of
her
servants
her
maid
a
faithful
girl
came
to
her
in
her
room
could
she
let
her
go
home
for
a
while
her
mother
was
very
ill
and
needed
her
she
hated
to
leave
just
now
and
would
only
it
was
her
mother
yes
margaret
said
hastily
feeling
with
a
throb
of
loneliness
that
the
ties
of
blood
were
to
be
nourished
not
denied
then
when
the
girl
was
gone
she
felt
bereft
through
that
long
morning
margaret
waited
the
air
she
breathed
was
dead
and
deadening
she
gasped
sometimes
for
breath
it
was
the
close
oppressive
air
that
presages
a
storm
it
seemed
to
press
upon
her
so
she
went
once
to
the
window
expecting
without
knowing
why
to
see
the
lightning
and
to
hear
the
thunder
roll
and
felt
vague
surprise
to
see
the
leaves
stirred
by
the
breeze
and
over
all
the
sunlight
there
was
no
storm
she
moved
restlessly
about
her
room
putting
her
drawers
to
rights
with
a
strange
feeling
unformulated
even
to
herself
but
pressing
hard
that
she
must
put
her
house
in
order
for
the
end
was
near
in
the
upper
hall
near
her
door
was
the
telephone
she
went
once
to
it
took
the
receiver
down
and
then
returned
it
to
the
hook
turning
afterwards
resolutely
to
it
and
telling
herself
he
is
my
husband
it
certainly
is
my
right
to
know
then
to
the
one
who
answered
she
said
brightly
will
you
please
ask
de
jarnette
to
come
to
the
she
would
not
ask
if
he
was
there
to
her
excited
imagination
that
would
seem
to
imply
that
she
did
not
know
of
his
whereabouts
the
answer
came
is
that
you
de
jarnette
good
morning
madam
why
de
jarnette
has
come
in
yet
probably
somebody
stopped
him
on
the
way
down
yes
well
i
will
tell
him
when
he
comes
in
margaret
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
after
eleven
she
sat
down
faint
and
trembling
he
had
not
been
to
the
office
soon
after
this
judge
kirtley
called
to
see
her
on
some
matter
of
business
he
asked
her
casually
about
victor
and
she
answered
with
a
smile
and
a
steady
voice
feeling
all
the
time
that
if
he
said
another
word
she
must
go
to
him
and
fall
upon
his
breast
and
cry
aloud
then
was
she
pretty
well
ah
that
was
good
no
kirtley
was
in
bed
with
grippe
the
doctor
said
he
should
keep
her
there
a
good
while
well
she
must
take
good
care
of
herself
patting
her
cheek
and
when
he
was
gone
margaret
had
an
insane
desire
to
scream
it
seemed
to
her
that
everybody
was
leaving
her
where
was
victor
at
two
richard
de
jarnette
came
he
found
her
in
the
library
with
that
strange
restlessness
and
presentiment
of
coming
ill
which
possessed
her
she
was
looking
over
papers
in
her
desk
and
putting
things
in
place
a
waste
basket
beside
her
was
half
filled
with
old
letters
from
the
drawer
just
emptied
she
had
taken
a
revolver
of
peculiar
workmanship
it
was
one
belonging
to
her
husband
which
he
had
left
in
the
desk
she
was
taking
it
up
with
the
intention
of
carrying
it
to
his
room
but
when
the
servant
announced
de
jarnette
she
laid
it
hastily
on
the
top
of
the
desk
and
put
the
drawer
back
when
she
rose
to
meet
her
she
took
hold
of
the
desk
to
steady
herself
for
she
had
a
feeling
that
this
visit
was
upon
no
trifling
errand
as
she
did
so
her
hand
touched
the
revolver
and
she
drew
back
it
is
victor
she
said
i
was
putting
it
away
he
looked
at
the
revolver
taking
in
as
people
do
sometimes
in
the
crises
of
their
lives
the
details
of
its
curious
workmanship
he
wasted
no
time
in
formalities
he
had
come
to
ask
her
about
victor
did
she
know
anything
about
him
where
he
was
no
she
did
not
know
he
had
gone
away
she
was
controlling
herself
by
so
strong
an
effect
that
her
voice
sounded
hard
where
was
he
had
any
message
come
from
him
richard
de
jarnette
had
not
had
much
experience
in
dealing
with
women
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
telegram
and
handed
it
to
her
it
was
dated
new
york
she
held
it
with
unsteady
hand
and
read
wire
me
two
thousand
dollars
paris
credit
lyonnais
sail
victor
de
jarnette
she
grew
white
as
the
dead
you
knew
nothing
of
this
he
asked
nothing
and
can
you
give
me
no
idea
of
what
it
means
his
voice
was
tense
so
much
so
that
it
had
the
unfortunate
effect
of
making
his
words
sound
severe
margaret
stared
at
the
paper
feeling
the
earth
sway
beneath
her
feet
no
unless
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
we
quarreled
last
night
a
bitter
quarrel
quarreled
about
what
he
spoke
sharply
she
lifted
her
head
at
that
and
looked
full
at
him
about
something
that
concerns
only
ourselves
i
think
i
beg
your
pardon
you
are
quite
right
i
did
not
mean
to
intrude
but
only
to
find
out
if
i
could
the
meaning
of
this
incomprehensible
thing
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
i
would
like
to
serve
you
of
course
this
will
be
known
she
said
hesitatingly
if
if
it
could
be
kept
out
of
the
papers
i
should
be
glad
it
would
only
avert
publicity
for
a
little
while
but
i
might
be
stronger
then
to
bear
it
i
will
see
to
it
at
once
the
papers
will
say
if
you
desire
that
he
has
been
called
away
on
urgent
business
oh
yes
if
you
will
be
so
good
i
think
i
hope
and
still
i
do
not
know
that
it
can
ever
be
arranged
as
he
rose
to
go
he
said
after
an
awkward
silence
i
seem
unfortunate
in
my
questions
but
i
hope
you
will
not
misunderstand
me
has
he
left
you
money
oh
i
have
money
yes
all
i
need
i
do
not
misunderstand
you
you
are
very
kind
he
bowed
gravely
then
after
another
silence
of
course
you
know
that
this
will
mean
quite
an
absence
from
home
even
if
he
should
turn
around
and
come
back
as
soon
as
he
reaches
the
other
shore
he
was
adding
savagely
to
himself
as
he
will
when
he
hears
from
me
yes
i
know
murmured
margaret
faintly
have
you
not
some
elderly
friend
that
you
could
have
with
you
for
a
while
i
am
sure
victor
has
gone
off
only
in
a
spirit
of
pique
he
was
always
impulsive
and
headstrong
if
you
could
ask
some
such
person
she
shook
her
head
i
am
very
much
alone
she
said
her
childish
helplessness
would
have
touched
a
stone
you
see
i
have
no
relatives
and
kirtley
i
am
sure
she
would
have
come
is
she
was
twisting
the
telegram
with
nervous
fingers
feeling
again
that
mad
desire
to
scream
she
felt
sure
she
would
do
so
if
he
spoke
another
sympathetic
word
he
turned
his
eyes
away
i
really
think
you
should
have
some
older
woman
with
you
other
than
your
maid
just
now
my
maid
is
gone
she
said
a
lump
rising
in
her
throat
repeating
it
leaves
me
very
much
alone
that
settles
it
he
said
i
shall
send
my
housekeeper
to
you
from
elmhurst
she
is
reliable
and
kind
you
can
depend
upon
her
fully
she
has
always
lived
with
us
and
there
is
nothing
she
likes
so
well
as
to
mother
people
her
chin
quivered
like
a
child
i
i
think
i
mothering
she
said
he
beat
a
hasty
retreat
her
helplessness
wrung
his
heart
two
hours
later
mammy
cely
presented
herself
before
margaret
rotund
of
figure
dark
and
shining
of
face
and
but
in
her
kind
eyes
was
the
brooding
spirit
of
motherhood
mammy
cely
was
of
the
old
school
as
she
stood
there
in
her
clean
dark
gingham
white
apron
white
head
handkerchief
and
a
piece
of
like
immaculateness
crossing
her
breast
she
was
the
embodiment
of
a
past
civilization
an
archaic
reminder
of
the
old
régime
which
everybody
condemns
which
nobody
wants
revived
but
which
has
its
sacred
memories
of
friendships
between
high
and
low
that
come
as
all
memories
do
only
to
those
who
have
experienced
in
the
far
past
that
for
which
the
memory
stands
to
margaret
this
humble
friend
was
a
gift
from
heaven
but
all
this
time
mammy
cely
was
unobtrusively
taking
in
the
situation
that
child
done
stood
all
she
ken
now
she
was
saying
to
herself
pretty
soon
she

remarked

set
down
now
she
asked
the
frightened
girl
a
few
questions
putting
in
a
running
commentary
of
soothing
remarks
and
margaret
found
herself
settling

and
margaret
fell
weeping
into

that
night

down

shadow

the
black

chapter
vii
tried
as
by
fire
it
was
long
months
before
margaret
de
jarnette
looked
into
her
face
before
that
time
washington
squares
and
circles
and
triangles
those
blessed
breathing
spots
had
blossomed
out
from
hyacinths
to
flaunting
salvias
a
stately
gorgeous
lengthening
procession
proclaiming
to
those
who
understand
the
language
or
who
care
to
hear
he
hath
made
all
things
beautiful
in
its
time
gradually
the
soft
spring
air
had
yielded
to
the
power
that
always
wins
and
a
blistering
heat
had
fallen
on
the
city
the
fierce
rays
beating
down
upon
the
asphalt
streets
which
threw
them
back
defiantly
until
the
very
air
palpitated
with
the
conflict
then
even
the
asphalt
gave
it
up
and
lay
a
sodden
mass
no
longer
master
of
its
fate
but
meekly
yielding
to
the
impress
of
every
grinding
heel
the
leaves
hung
motionless
the
air
was
dead
and
one
remembered
apprehensively
that
some
day
the
earth
would
melt
with
fervent
heat
and
wondered
gasping
if
that
time
were
now
then
having
proved
his
power
old
sol
relaxed
his
grasp
and
turned
away
his
face
and
men
began
to
hope
again
and
to
remind
one
another
as
the
breeze
sprang
up
of
the
promise
given
with
the
bow
that
while
the
earth
remaineth
cold
and
heat
and
summer
and
winter
shall
not
cease
then
autumn
flung
her
gorgeous
banners
to
the
breeze
and
the
indians
kindled
their
campfires
in
the
west
and
shouting
children
ploughed
the
streets
where
the
yellow
poplar
leaves
came
down
and
like
a
carpet
lay
thus
passed
nature
shifting
panorama
which
waits
no
man
pleasure
stops
for
none
but
brings
all
to
an
end
at
last
to
margaret
they
had
been
months
of
sore
trial
of
hope
deferred
and
the
suspense
that
kills
the
rising
up
each
day
to
meet
the
mute
sympathy
of
real
friends
and
the
curiosity
of
those
called
friends
by
courtesy
who
made
her
rage
within
herself
and
left
her
powerless
to
resent
then
there
was
that
other
sort
who
came
to
her
prating
of
sympathy
but
telling
her
always
of
what
others
said
the
words
of
a
talebearer
are
as
wounds
these
went
down
into
the
innermost
parts
of
margaret
soul
but
through
it
all
she
carried
herself
with
a
dignity
and
poise
that
enforced
respect
and
in
time
silenced
even
gossip
to
all
these
invitations
to
confidence
she
made
no
response
she
could
not
stop
people
tongues
but
she
would
give
them
no
occasion
to
wag
by
any
word
of
hers
this
thing
had
been
between
her
and
her
husband
there
it
should
remain
so
when
marie
van
dorn
came
saying
effusively
you
poor
child
i
have
heard
and
came
to
you
as
soon
as
the
nurse
would
let
me
you
can
trust
me
my
dear
margaret
had
replied
quietly
thank
you
you
are
very
kind
to
come
to
see
me
i
shall
be
a
good
deal
housed
for
a
while
and
rather
lonely
in
de
jarnette
absence
what
do
you
hear
from
your
aunt
and
marie
had
made
but
a
short
call
to
judge
kirtley
who
had
come
as
soon
as
she
could
see
him
she
had
said
her
eyes
heavy
with
unshed
tears
i
would
trust
you
beyond
any
living
soul
but
this
is
not
a
thing
about
which
even
you
could
help
me
i
need
not
tell
you
there
is
something
wrong
you
know
that
it
may
come
right
i
can
not
tell
if
it
does
i
should
be
sorry
i
had
talked
if
it
does
not
the
case
would
not
be
helped
by
words
i
can
not
take
the
world
into
my
confidence
do
you
blame
me
no
dear
child
he
said
with
an
aching
of
his
great
heart
i
honor
you
if
more
women
took
this
stand
there
would
be
fewer
cases
of
domestic
trouble
in
the
courts
keep
your
own
counsel
but
when
you
need
me
speak
to
his
wife
that
night
he
said
margaret
is
a
rare
woman
not
one
in
a
hundred
at
her
age
would
see
this
as
she
does
and
have
the
strength
of
character
to
lock
everything
in
her
own
breast
well
for
my
part
replied
kirtley
who
felt
aggrieved
at
margaret
want
of
confidence
i
think
she
is
too
it
would
relieve
her
mind
to
talk
to
some
safe
confidant
it
would
relieve
the
mind
of
the
safe
confidant
more
her
husband
replied
astutely
margaret
is
all
right
you
know
what
seneca
says
you
wish
another
to
keep
your
secret
first
keep
it
yourself
i
wish
you
would
always
be
quoting
those
old
heathen
philosophers
to
me
said
kirtley
with
growing
irritation
she
had
fully
expected
to
hear
the
whole
story
when
her
husband
came
home
she
was
not
quite
sure
now
that
he
had
told
all
he
knew
the
judge
chuckled
my
dear
if
i
had
said
solomon
instead
of
seneca
i
have
no
doubt
you
would
have
thought
that
you
could
find
that
in
the
book
of
proverbs
it
is
sage
enough
to
be
there
another
proverb
is
doubtless
in
margaret
mind
the
substance
of
it
at
any
rate
and
i
will
relieve
your
perturbation
by
saying
that
this
is
accredited
to
the
talmud
and
may
have
more
weight
with
you
than
that
of
my
good
pagan
this
certainly
is
worthy
of
the
wise
man
friend
hath
a
friend
and
thy
friend
friend
hath
a
friend
so
be
discreet
margaret
certainly
knows
that
she
can
trust
us
returned
his
wife
indignantly
my
dear
is
the
better
word
implies
a
possibility
of
her
trying
and
that
i
suspect
she
is
not
going
to
do
for
the
present
let
her
alone
she
is
all
right
but
under
his
light
words
he
had
a
sore
heart
the
girl
was
very
dear
to
him
she
was
in
trouble
and
he
could
not
help
her
he
contented
himself
with
looking
closely
after
her
business
interests
his
friendship
being
of
the
rare
kind
which
is
willing
to
give
much
looking
not
for
a
return
and
with
dropping
in
often
to
see
her
and
the
baby
i
am
going
to
call
him
philip
varnum
she
said
to
him
on
one
of
these
occasions
you
must
help
me
to
make
him
worthy
of
the
name
it
was
all
she
said
but
he
understood
without
anything
more
that
she
expected
to
rear
the
child
without
the
help
of
his
father
of
richard
de
jarnette
margaret
saw
less
and
less
as
time
went
on
there
was
a
feeling
of
constraint
between
them
natural
enough
perhaps
under
the
circumstances
and
for
some
reason
growing
during
those
first
weeks
after
her
illness
he
had
come
often
to
the
house
had
shown
her
unobtrusive
kindnesses
and
done
thoughtful
things
that
added
to
her
comfort
always
in
a
way
evading
thanks
whenever
possible
sometimes
she
only
heard
of
them
through
mammy
cely
at
rare
intervals
he
even
held
the
boy
when
the
old
nurse
who
stood
in
awe
of
no
man
and
least
of
all
of
this
one
who
had
been
her
foster
child
had
put
it
into
his
arms
he
did
it
very
awkwardly
is
true
and
in
a
fashion
that
gave
margaret
nervous
chills
of
fright
lest
he
should
drop
him
or
do
some
other
dreadful
thing
but
manfully
as
one
who
has
a
duty
to
perform
and
does
it
with
set
teeth
one
day
when
mammy
cely
had
taken
the
child
away
he
asked
abruptly
you
find
her
useful
to
you
useful
mammy
cely
she
said
oh
i
think
i
could
not
live
without
her
i
know
so
little
about
children
then
in
sudden
alarm
she
faltered
were
you
thinking
of
taking
her
i
i
had
almost
forgotten
you
sent
her
to
me
she
looked
so
distressed
that
he
hastened
to
assure
her
that
the
woman
should
stay
as
long
as
she
was
needed
he
could
get
somebody
else
for
elmhurst
she
felt
so
profoundly
grateful
that
she
sung
the
praises
of
the
colored
woman
how
she
could
trust
her
as
she
could
not
trust
herself
because
mammy
cely
knew
so
much
more
and
how
she
was
sure
she
loved
baby
philip
as
if
he
were
her
own
these
and
other
words
of
confidence
which
afterwards
strangely
enough
recoiled
on
her
head
to
all
of
which
he
had
listened
bowing
gravely
and
looking
at
her
with
that
close
attention
which
always
made
her
forget
what
it
was
that
she
had
meant
to
say
somehow
he
had
a
deadening
effect
upon
her
speech
she
could
not
help
feeling
deep
down
in
her
heart
that
he
believed
her
responsible
for
his
brother
defection
it
was
natural
enough
that
he
should
try
to
excuse
him
he
had
always
done
that
mammy
cely
said
even
when
he
was
a
boy
and
had
often
taken
the
punishment
that
belonged
to
victor
rather
than
tell
he
had
been
very
very
fond
of
victor
she
said
yes
it
was
natural
enough
margaret
thought
but
still
it
did
not
conduce
to
conversation
and
she
was
glad
that
day
when
he
went
away
then
she
had
gone
to
the
nursery
another
person
and
taken
little
philip
and
clucked
to
him
and
touched
his
cheeks
to
make
him
smile
and
told
him
what
she
thought
of
his
uncle
richard
how
cold
he
was
how
silent
how
he
scared
her
how
he
palsied
her
tongue
or
else
made
her
say
things
she
did
not
mean
to
say
how
greatest
indignity
of
all
he
had
even
looked
askance
at
her
lamb
and
almost
turned
him
upside
down
but
how
he
had
left
them
mammy
cely
and
so
they
would
forgive
him
if
only
he
would
never
come
again
and
baby
philip
smiled
a
smile
cherubic
and
murmured
for
the
first
time
and
margaret
almost
smothered
him
with
kisses
and
was
sure
that
never
did
mother
have
a
comforter
so
sweet
a
confidant
so
safe
and
yet
so
sympathetic
where
does
a
baby
get
its
balm
in
that
gilead
whence
it
came
from
the
skilful
physician
who
knows
all
needs
and
uses
tiniest
instruments
sometimes
to
reach
hidden
wounds
who
knows
at
any
rate
into
sore
heart
was
coming
day
by
day
the
healing
that
proceeds
only
from
time
and
the
touch
of
little
hands
more
and
more
by
her
own
volition
her
world
was
coming
to
be
bounded
by
the
walls
of
her
baby
room
here
at
least
she
was
safe
from
the
thrusts
of
meddlesome
gossip
and
the
pin
pricks
of
gossip
handmaid
curiosity
here
she
could
live
the
simple
satisfying
life
that
maketh
rich
and
addeth
no
sorrow
that
she
was
not
willing
to
bear
chapter
viii
a
new
rôle
for
richard
in
all
these
months
margaret
had
not
once
heard
from
her
husband
rumors
had
come
to
her
that
he
had
not
gone
alone
but
even
this
she
could
not
verify
for
she
had
ended
the
subject
peremptorily
with
the
informant
who
brought
the
story
but
the
thorn
implanted
that
day
rankled
her
judgment
and
her
knowledge
of
him
told
her
it
was
true
the
fiction
of
her
husband
call
abroad
on
urgent
business
served
its
purpose
as
a
nominal
explanation
but
it
deceived
nobody
every
one
knew
that
victor
de
jarnette
had
no
large
business
interests
in
europe
or
anywhere
else
and
that
he
was
not
the
man
to
make
any
great
sacrifice
for
them
if
he
had
had
being
a
man
of
pleasure
more
than
of
affairs
the
knowing
raised
their
brows
and
smiled
the
sympathetic
said
poor
margaret
she
asked
richard
de
jarnette
only
once
if
he
had
ever
heard
no
he
said
he
had
not
he
had
written
and
would
let
her
know
when
the
answer
came
he
did
not
tell
her
that
his
letter
had
been
a
bitter
arraignment
of
victor
for
his
want
of
manliness
in
deserting
his
wife
as
he
had
done
and
a
stern
demand
that
he
should
for
the
sake
of
the
de
jarnette
name
if
for
no
better
reason
return
or
give
some
adequate
explanation
of
his
conduct
there
could
be
no
excuse
he
had
not
spared
him
failing
to
hear
from
this
he
wrote
again
this
time
adding
the
virile
argument
that
in
case
of
victor
failure
to
explain
his
conduct
he
should
at
once
revise
his
will
and
name
his
victor
apparently
forgotten
child
as
his
heir
instead
of
himself
he
felt
that
he
had
an
elder
brother
prerogative
to
counsel
and
also
the
right
of
an
outraged
de
jarnette
to
protest
against
the
dishonoring
of
his
name
as
child
and
man
richard
de
jarnette
had
been
slow
to
wrath
but
once
roused
there
was
a
tenacity
about
him
that
was
hard
to
shake
off
perhaps
that
last
clause
was
the
most
powerful
argument
he
used
the
younger
de
jarnette
had
a
great
abundance
of
money
of
his
own
but
richard
had
more
and
victor
had
always
expected
to
inherit
it
moreover
he
knew
that
his
brother
never
made
an
idle
threat
so
he
wrote
when
this
answer
to
his
peremptory
letter
was
read
by
richard
de
jarnette
it
put
a
somewhat
different
face
upon
the
matter
he
had
been
forced
to
this
victor
said
by
margaret
action
it
was
virtually
she
that
had
deserted
him
she
had
laid
upon
him
such
restrictions
as
no
man
would
for
a
moment
submit
to
she
had
been
unreasonable
exacting
and
jealous
to
a
degree
that
was
intolerable
if
you
only
knew
all
you
would
retract
your
harsh
words
victor
wrote
i
have
always
found
you
just
and
certainly
now
that
the
greatest
trouble
of
my
life
has
overtaken
me
i
can
not
believe
that
i
will
find
you
lacking
in
either
sympathy
or
understanding
and
thus
and
thus
and
thus
victor
was
always
a
ready
letter
writer
richard
de
jarnette
read
this
letter
very
thoroughly
and
as
he
read
a
wave
of
pity
swept
over
him
for
the
misguided
boy
he
was
little
more
than
a
boy
always
impulsive
passionate
and
but
to
the
brother
who
was
his
judge
always
and
affectionate
the
letter
had
its
effect
the
world
had
judged
victor
harshly
richard
thought
he
with
the
rest
he
more
than
all
the
rest
perhaps
it
might
be
as
he
said
that
had
they
known
but
then
the
damning
fact
remained
that
he
had
deserted
her
his
young
wife
in
her
time
of
need
no
nothing
could
palliate
that
nothing
he
took
up
the
letter
at
that
and
read
further
margaret
had
virtually
driven
him
forth
victor
went
on
and
richard
remembered
that
the
house
was
hers
built
by
money
her
father
had
left
in
trust
for
this
very
purpose
he
had
warned
victor
that
trouble
would
come
from
that
some
day
women
could
not
be
trusted
to
refrain
from
taunting
their
husbands
with
mine
and
thine
when
the
test
came
he
said
contemptuously
they
were
all
alike
and
where
was
the
man
that
would
stand
humiliation
like
that
certainly
his
name
was
not
de
jarnette
this
doubtless
lay
at
the
root
of
the
matter
and
was
perhaps
the
reason
that
margaret
was
so
reticent
about
the
cause
of
the
trouble
perhaps
oh
curse
the
thing
it
was
a
matter
for
him
to
meddle
with
of
course
not
but
it
needed
somebody
and
whom
else
did
they
have
it
ended
in
his
reaching
the
deliberate
and
most
unwelcome
conclusion
after
much
struggle
with
himself
that
it
was
his
duty
to
go
to
his
house
and
enter
upon
the
delicate
and
perilous
office
of
peacemaker
which
he
did
margaret
met
him
distantly
they
froze
each
other
he
had
heard
from
victor
he
told
her
bluntly
feeling
his
poverty
of
phrases
suited
to
womankind
her
lips
straightened
she
held
out
her
hand
could
she
see
the
letter
he
reflected
a
moment
the
letter
as
he
thought
of
it
did
not
seem
particularly
pacific
viewed
from
the
of
a
deserted
wife
so
he
answered
no
then
he
began
awkwardly
and
without
preliminaries
to
explain
he
had
come
to
see
if
things
could
not
be
arranged
between
them
patched
up
for
a
while
with
the
hope
that
time
would
bring
them
right
they
were
both
young
and
doubtless
both
had
been
somewhat
in
fault
she
interrupted
him
here
to
ask
pointedly
has
your
brother
told
you
anything
about
the
point
at
issue
he
was
forced
to
answer
that
he
had
not
then
you
are
not
competent
to
arbitrate
she
said
quietly
and
the
subject
was
not
easy
to
after
that
he
went
away
baffled
in
his
endeavors
berating
himself
for
a
blundering
fool
but
strengthened
in
the
belief
that
the
blame
was
not
all
on
one
side
the
girl
was
ice
as
he
thought
it
over
that
night
one
thing
came
back
to
him
again
and
again
she
had
said
this
is
a
thing
that
must
be
settled
without
a
and
day
it
will
what
did
she
mean
by
that
how
would
it
be
settled
she
had
looked
uncompromising
as
she
said
it
what
did
she
intend
to
do
get
a
divorce
of
course
she
could
get
it
on
the
palpable
ground
of
desertion
he
could
see
a
difference
in
her
attitude
toward
victor
as
the
months
went
by
at
first
there
had
been
a
reserve
a
suspension
of
judgment
then
apathy
and
of
late
growing
resentment
he
had
correctly
interpreted
her
states
of
mind
though
he
did
not
appreciate
the
cause
as
the
months
went
by
and
victor
did
not
come
did
not
write
did
not
once
even
ask
about
his
child
her
heart
hardened
against
him
this
ignoring
of
philip
seemed
worse
to
her
almost
than
his
treatment
of
herself
how
could
he
stay
away
from
his
child
how
could
he
be
false
to
a
helpless
little
thing
like
this
that
he
had
brought
into
the
world
how
could
he
then
she
would
snatch
little
philip
up
in
a
passion
of
tenderness
and
cry
in
her
heart
i
will
be
father
and
mother
both
to
you
my
baby
my
poor
little
forsaken
baby
as
the
months
went
by
the
chances
seemed
slighter
that
this
thing
would
ever
be
patched
up
as
richard
de
jarnette
had
said
she
asked
judge
kirtley
one
day
if
a
man
had
any
claim
upon
a
child
he
had
deserted
yes
he
told
her
without
comment
unless
the
mother
was
divorced
from
him
she
closed
her
lips
suddenly
and
said
no
more
she
had
read
in
the
paper
one
day
about
a
man
taking
his
child
away
from
its
mother
who
had
left
him
the
woman
was
a
catholic
and
could
not
have
recourse
to
divorce
to
protect
herself
margaret
thought
a
good
deal
about
this
incident
she
had
always
been
opposed
to
divorce
richard
de
jarnette
came
to
her
again
one
day
he
had
had
another
letter
from
victor
a
very
touching
one
it
had
seemed
to
him
as
he
read
it
with
margaret
cold
eyes
upon
him
it
seemed
less
so
victor
was
anxious
for
a
reconciliation
he
told
her
and
she
bowed
he
was
tired
of
his
expatriation
and
longed
for
home
she
smiled
and
for
a
sight
of
his
child
he
is
long
remembering
his
child
she
said
richard
de
jarnette
bit
his
lip
cursing
himself
for
having
come
on
this
errand
but
he
had
come
at
victor
earnest
request
and
he
would
not
abandon
the
case
i
recognize
the
justice
of
what
you
imply
he
returned
i
can
hardly
ask
for
him
any
leniency
on
your
part
but
after
all
the
child
is
victor
as
well
as
yours
and
is
his
heir
it
is
but
natural
that
he
should
wish
to
see
him
for
philip
sake
i
trust
that
in
some
way
your
differences
may
be
arranged
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
they
will
never
be
she
said
as
long
as
there
was
a
shadow
of
a
hope
that
i
had
misjudged
him
i
held
my
peace
not
even
to
you
would
i
say
aught
against
him
now
that
my
faith
in
him
is
dead
i
tell
you
plainly
i
shall
never
be
victor
de
jarnette
wife
again
you
asked
me
once
what
we
quarreled
about
i
will
tell
you
now
for
this
is
the
last
conversation
we
will
have
on
the
subject
he
was
untrue
to
me
her
eyes
blazed
the
night
we
quarreled
i
had
found
it
out
and
i
told
him
he
must
choose
between
us
he
chose
the
woman
who
was
not
his
wife
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
that
choice
is
irrevocable
this
was
enough
surely
this
enough
but
it
was
not
all
as
you
know
by
his
cruel
desertion
of
me
and
his
unborn
child
he
made
me
a
target
for
the
arrows
of
gossip
and
slander
do
you
ask
me
to
forget
all
this
do
you
mean
that
you
intend
to
secure
a
divorce
he
asked
her
plainly
no
i
shall
make
no
effort
to
secure
a
divorce
people
get
divorces
because
they
want
to
marry
again
i
have
had
enough
of
marriage
and
if
he
should
want
one
i
shall
not
oppose
it
all
that
i
want
now
is
to
live
out
my
own
life
what
is
left
of
it
in
my
own
way
with
my
child
he
sat
a
moment
in
thought
then
he
felt
constrained
to
say
i
trust
there
may
never
be
any
trouble
about
the
child
victor
is
reckless
and
determined
if
he
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
lay
claim
to
it
or
try
to
take
it
from
you
if
victor
de
jarnette
should
lay
a
finger
of
his
hand
upon
the
child
he
deserted
she
said
at
white
heat
i
should
kill
him
he
knew
of
course
that
this
was
mere
passionate
talk
she
was
justified
in
having
strong
feeling
he
thought
no
more
about
it
but
that
night
in
going
over
the
interview
what
she
had
said
that
other
time
came
back
to
him
it
is
a
thing
that
must
be
settled
without
a
she
had
said
and
some
day
it
will
be
what
did
she
mean
by
that
a
mere
separation
settled
nothing
he
feared
that
victor
might
give
her
trouble
about
the
child
chapter
ix
the
reaping
of
the
crop
oh
mammy
cely
look
he
is
standing
alone
margaret
was
sitting
on
the
floor
her
lips
parted
in
rapturous
delight
at
the
temerity
of
her
infant
son
who
was
rather
shakily
making
his
little
experiment
with
the
center
of
gravity
unfortunately
for
its
success
he
became
aware
at
the
critical
moment
of
the
sensation
he
was
creating
tottered
and
sank
in
a
heap
a
victim
like
many
another
who
essays
the
trial
of
his
powers
to
to
partial
mother
eyes
however
it
had
been
a
triumph
new
in
the
annals
of
the
world
and
margaret
caught
him
up
smothering
him
with
kisses
and
pouring
into
his
ears
the
most
extravagant
encomiums
ah
if
only
we
the
children
of
a
larger
growth
could
have
our
feeble
efforts
to
stand
upon
our
feet
to
make
some
progress
however
slight
along
the
way
to
utter
though
imperfectly
the
thoughts
that
cry
for
speech
if
we
in
all
this
could
have
a
tithe
of
the
wealth
of
sympathy
and
stimulating
praise
that
mothers
give
what
might
we
not
become
mammy
cely
looked
on
with
equal
pride
he
certainly
is
mighty
on
his
laigs
she
remarked
with
pride
he
gwineter
be
walkin
befo
long
that
chile
is
he
like
his
uncle
richard
he
gwineter
git
his
strengt
early
margaret
made
no
reply
to
this
the
truth
was
she
got
rather
tired
of
hearing
about
philip
uncle
richard
to
her
the
weeks
were
becoming
mere
pegs
on
which
to
hang
some
new
phase
of
the
child
development
there
was
such
an
astonishing
succession
of
first
things
yesterday
the
first
tooth
a
pearl
such
as
nobody
had
ever
seen
before
the
wonderful
feat
of
standing
alone
the
blissful
anticipation
of
the
first
step
the
next
day
perhaps
the
first
word
and
then
oh
what
a
world
of
companionship
that
would
let
her
into
life
was
closing
up
behind
her
but
opening
in
front
now
get
him
ready
mammy
cely
for
his
ride
i
want
him
to
be
out
all
he
can
this
fine
weather
a
little
later
you
know
well
what
is
it
she
interrupted
herself
to
ask
of
the
man
who
now
stood
at
the
door
he
had
a
scared
look
de
jarnette
is
down
stairs
miss
de
jarnette
what
in
the
world
has
he
come
for
at
this
time
of
day
wondered
margaret
tell
him
i
will
be
down
at
once
it
a
ai
r
r
richard
de
jarnette
miss
said
the
man
stammering
in
his
excitement
it
mr
victor
victor
and
announced
like
a
stranger
in
his
own
home
she
hardly
knew
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
as
she
answered
tell
him
i
will
be
down
at
once
at
the
door
of
the
parlor
she
stopped
her
heart
was
beating
so
tumultuously
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
would
suffocate
she
threw
her
head
back
as
one
who
struggles
for
breath
then
she
went
in
closing
the
door
behind
her
what
passed
in
that
interview
nobody
ever
knew
the
air
was
rife
the
next
day
with
what
it
might
have
been
but
the
only
thing
ever
reported
was
a
fragment
overheard
by
the
mulatto
who
answered
the
bell
and
who
at
that
particular
time
was
alert
to
do
his
duty
he
related
to
richard
de
jarnette
the
next
day
that
as
victor
opened
the
door
to
leave
the
parlor
he
heard
him
say
whatever
you
do
you
may
as
well
understand
now
that
i
shall
relinquish
my
claim
to
here
the
man
said
he
missed
something
because
it
was
spoken
in
a
lower
tone
but
he
was
sure
it
must
have
been
something
about
money
for
he
distinctly
heard
him
use
the
word
claim
from
that
interview
margaret
went
to
her
room
and
later
from
the
house
with
a
face
so
white
and
haggard
that
as
mammy
cely
related
to
richard
de
jarnette
who
called
enquiring
for
victor
a
half
hour
after
she
was
gone
she
was
actually
afraid
of
what
she
might
do
to
herself
she
seemed
sorter
desprit
marse
richard
she
concluded
with
the
freedom
of
an
old
family
servant
and
sorter
no

i
did
know
what
she
was
goin
to
do

she
says
look
lak
she
was
takin
somethin
mighty
hard
she
was
naturally
excited
over
de
jarnette
return
said
richard
but
he
left
the
house
abruptly
and
called
a
passing
cab
to
take
him
to
his
office
he
was
more
disturbed
at
what
he
had
heard
than
he
would
admit
to
mammy
cely
victor
had
had
a
long
talk
with
him
before
going
to
margaret
in
fact
he
had
gone
directly
to
richard
upon
reaching
the
city
the
night
before
a
fact
that
had
appealed
insensibly
to
richard
heart
he
had
not
seen
him
since
and
feeling
vaguely
uneasy
he
had
at
last
gone
to
the
massachusetts
avenue
house
hoping
to
find
him
there
and
hoping
also
that
by
that
time
things
might
have
been
satisfactorily
arranged
mammy
cely
account
of
margaret
condition
made
him
distinctly
apprehensive
it
did
not
look
as
if
a
reconciliation
had
taken
place
to
say
the
least
he
must
find
out
first
of
all
where
victor
was
the
office
of
de
jarnette
and
de
jarnette
loans
and
mortgages
was
in
the
third
story
of
the
conococheague
building
on
f
street
one
of
the
finest
in
washington
at
that
time
they
consisted
of
a
large
corner
room
a
smaller
room
at
the
side
of
this
communicating
with
it
which
was
victor
private
office
and
a
still
smaller
one
beyond
this
which
he
had
had
fitted
up
as
a
lavatory
all
three
opened
upon
the
corridor
victor
room
being
nearest
the
stairway
which
was
alongside
of
the
elevators
these
offices
were
furnished
in
the
most
luxurious
fashion
and
after
victor
de
jarnette
faultless
taste
the
workroom
of
the
firm
was
richard
private
office
across
the
hall
in
absence
his
rooms
had
been
unused
and
untouched
except
by
the
man
who
did
the
cleaning
richard
de
jarnette
had
returned
to
the
building
with
the
intention
of
going
directly
to
victor
room
but
when
he
opened
his
own
door
a
letter
left
by
the
postman
attracted
his
attention
and
he
waited
to
read
it
in
the
midst
of
the
reading
he
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
a
pistol
he
threw
the
letter
down
and
started
for
the
hall
it
had
seemed
to
come
from
victor
room
he
rushed
across
to
his
door
it
was
locked
in
a
moment
he
had
made
his
way
through
the
front
office
into
the
back
room
an
appalling
sight
met
his
eyes
victor
lay
on
the
floor
near
his
desk
the
blood
trickling
over
the
carpet
from
a
hidden
wound
and
over
him
with
a
revolver
in
her
hand
the
one
he
had
seen
on
her
desk
stood
margaret
as
richard
face
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
turned
a
ghastly
face
upon
him
what
is
it
who
did
it
she
gasped
i
i
picked
this
up
put
it
down
he
said
sternly
and
pushed
past
her
in
the
hall
hurrying
steps
were
heard
and
a
confusion
of
voices
people
were
trying
the
door
richard
de
jarnette
knelt
beside
a
dying
man
but
there
was
a
flash
of
recognition
in
the
dimming
eyes
victor
in
god
name
what
is
this
the
wounded
man
lips
moved
his
head
was
on
his
brother
arm
and
richard
ear
was
close
enough
to
catch
the
gasping
whisper
she
killed
me
dick
what
does
he
say
cried
margaret
the
words
had
been
too
faint
to
reach
her
but
she
saw
a
look
of
horror
come
into
richard
de
face
who
did
it
how
did
it
happen
the
room
was
filling
with
men
semple
whose
office
was
across
the
hall
was
examining
the
wound
in
every
man
there
is
a
divine
spark
of
manliness
it
is
not
always
apparent
sometimes
it
would
seem
to
have
burned
itself
out
with
the
fierce
fires
of
passion
sometimes
to
have
been
quenched
by
the
slow
drippings
that
come
from
the
fount
called
selfishness
oftener
perhaps
it
is
smothered
under
a
sodden
blanket
of
sensuality
and
low
desires
but
it
is
a
spark
of
the
divine
fire
and
when
the
right
wind
strikes
it
it
leaps
into
flame
at
the
sound
of
margaret
voice
victor
de
jarnette
struggled
to
rise
raise
me
up
he
panted
there
is
something
i
must
say
say
it
quickly
said
the
doctor
holding
a
handkerchief
to
stanch
the
blood
there
is
no
time
to
lose
to
richard
and
the
men
back
of
them
he
added
impressively
this
is
a
dying
statement
and
they
gave
close
heed
his
head
supported
by
richard
arm
victor
gathered
his
strength
for
one
supreme
effort
and
said
so
distinctly
that
all
in
the
room
heard
it
it
was
accidental
i
did
it
myself
i
was
cleaning
my
revolver
men
eyes
sought
his
desk
where
lay
a
handkerchief
which
had
evidently
been
used
for
the
purpose
it
went
off
in
my
hand
he
sank
back
on
a
pillow
taken
hastily
from
the
couch
it
was
one
that
margaret
had
made
for
him
before
they
were
married
in
the
harvard
colors
it
looked
ghastly
put
to
such
a
use
ca
you
do
something
asked
richard
de
jarnette
hoarsely
of
the
doctor
no
richard
he
said
gently
he
is
almost
gone
the
dying
man
opened
his
eyes
dick
his
voice
was
very
faint
yes
victor
take
care
of
m
then
as
if
some
sudden
thought
or
recollection
had
come
to
him
he
struggled
again
to
rise
whispering
wildly
the
will
richard
the
will
do
let
his
head
dropped
back
against
the
crimson
letters
that
which
it
was
in
his
heart
to
say
would
be
forever
unsaid
chapter
x
dust
to
dust
at
the
coroner
inquest
margaret
was
the
first
one
questioned
when
victor
de
jarnette
breathed
his
last
semple
had
taken
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
apparently
almost
stupefied
into
richard
room
there
to
await
the
summons
to
appear
before
the
coroner
who
was
immediately
notified
of
the
death
when
she
came
in
she
was
entirely
collected
though
very
pale
her
appearance
indicated
more
horror
at
what
had
occurred
than
grief
which
was
but
natural
under
the
circumstances
as
more
than
one
man
thought
recalling
the
past
year
when
questioned
she
stated
that
her
husband
had
been
with
her
through
the
afternoon
that
he
had
left
her
home
about
four
and
that
she
had
come
down
to
the
office
an
hour
or
so
later
she
had
gone
directly
to
the
door
of
the
main
office
and
just
before
reaching
it
had
heard
the
pistol
shot
she
ran
through
the
front
office
into
de
jarnette
private
room
feeling
sure
that
the
sound
had
come
from
there
she
had
found
him
on
the
floor
and
near
him
a
revolver
which
she
recognized
as
one
that
he
had
had
in
his
possession
for
several
years
here
suddenly
recalling
de
jarnette
peremptory
command
to
her
to
put
the
pistol
down
she
hesitated
and
looked
at
him
his
face
was
averted
she
went
on
saying
nothing
about
having
had
the
pistol
in
her
hand
nor
about
its
being
one
of
a
pair
that
her
husband
owned
though
this
fact
came
to
her
suddenly
she
had
not
had
time
to
question
him
she
said
nor
even
to
go
to
him
before
de
jarnette
came
in
had
she
heard
any
sound
at
the
other
door
no
she
had
heard
nothing
or
rather
she
had
been
so
to
come
upon
her
husband
in
this
condition
that
she
had
not
noticed
anything
richard
de
jarnette
stated
that
he
had
heard
the
shot
while
he
was
in
his
own
room
across
the
hall
and
had
hurried
at
once
to
the
outside
door
of
his
brother
room
finding
it
locked
he
had
run
around
through
the
main
office
and
found
things
just
as
de
jarnette
had
testified
the
door
was
locked
but
it
was
a
night
latch
he
got
up
to
show
one
might
have
gone
out
that
way
without
encountering
you
the
coroner
asked
and
de
jarnette
hesitating
and
weighing
his
words
thought
it
hardly
probable
though
possible
margaret
interrupted
timidly
here
to
say
that
since
he
spoke
of
the
door
she
recollected
hearing
something
just
as
she
came
in
that
sounded
like
the
closing
of
a
door
de
jarnette
turned
toward
her
and
with
his
hard
eyes
upon
her
margaret
faltered
that
perhaps
it
was
the
outer
door
of
the
lavatory
investigation
proved
that
that
door
was
bolted
on
the
inside
i
can
not
see
the
pertinence
of
this
line
of
inquiry
said
de
jarnette
at
length
almost
roughly
in
the
face
of
his
dying
statement
that
it
was
accidental
and
his
eyes
as
if
by
chance
turned
upon
his
the
elevator
boy
was
questioned
as
to
whether
any
suspicious
person
had
gone
down
about
that
time
he
could
not
remember
it
seemed
to
him
upon
further
thought
that
a
fat
old
lady
had
got
on
going
down
at
the
time
of
the
pistol
shot
but
so
many
people
went
up
and
down
all
the
time
he
could
be
sure
that
it
was
not
on
the
floor
below
semple
was
examined
as
to
the
wound
i
have
made
no
careful
examination
he
said
slowly
beyond
assuring
myself
that
nothing
could
be
done
for
him
and
later
that
life
was
extinct
i
have
not
thought
it
necessary
a
dozen
men
are
here
who
heard
him
say
it
was
accidental
and
from
a
weapon
in
his
own
hand
he
picked
up
the
cloth
used
in
cleaning
the
revolver
this
seems
to
substantiate
his
statement
as
to
how
he
happened
to
have
the
pistol
several
men
were
examined
as
to
the
statement
the
coroner
report
was
accidental
killing
from
a
weapon
in
the
hand
of
the
deceased
since
it
had
been
clearly
shown
to
be
accidental
no
jury
was
impaneled
it
was
margaret
wish
that
victor
should
be
buried
from
his
own
home
when
judge
kirtley
communicated
this
wish
to
richard
de
jarnette
he
was
surprised
to
find
him
averse
to
the
arrangement
he
preferred
that
he
should
be
buried
from
home
he
said
briefly
they
were
separated
and
there
was
no
use
keeping
up
a
pretence
that
they
were
not
the
judge
remonstrated
that
nobody
knew
what
had
passed
between
them
that
afternoon
not
even
de
jarnette
nor
how
it
would
have
gone
in
the
future
had
victor
lived
margaret
wish
to
have
him
buried
from
his
own
home
would
seem
to
indicate
that
there
had
been
a
reconciliation
at
any
rate
it
would
put
a
different
face
on
the
matter
to
the
world
and
make
it
easier
for
her
afterwards
yes
richard
agreed
grimly
it
might
make
things
easier
for
her
and
he
consented
the
burial
service
was
brief
and
wholly
impersonal
the
burial
was
private
margaret
went
to
the
carriage
on
the
arm
of
her
by
the
arrangement
of
the
undertaker
he
had
not
been
near
her
since
the
day
they
separated
at
the
close
of
the
coroner
inquest
victor
de
jarnette
body
had
lain
in
his
brother
house
two
days
and
nights
and
had
then
been
taken
to
the
house
on
massachusetts
avenue
the
morning
of
the
burial
this
was
the
most
that
de
jarnette
would
consent
to
whatever
was
thought
about
the
grief
of
the
wife
at
this
untimely
death
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
that
of
the
brother
richard
de
jarnette
had
aged
years
in
these
few
days
as
the
carriage
door
was
closed
upon
margaret
alone
judge
kirtley
stepped
up
to
the
undertaker
does
not
de
jarnette
ride
with
de
jarnette
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
no
sir
he
preferred
to
ride
in
the
second
carriage
alone
the
third
is
reserved
for
you
sir
i
will
trouble
you
to
open
that
door
said
the
judge
rather
stiffly
indicating
the
first
carriage
you
may
use
your
third
carriage
for
some
one
else
or
dismiss
it
i
shall
ride
with
de
jarnette
in
a
green
bank
at
oak
hill
he
was
laid
oak
hill
that
beautiful
silent
suburb
which
for
a
century
of
the
capital
life
the
shifting
heaving
kaleidoscopic
life
in
which
men
come
and
go
and
wax
and
wane
and
pass
into
obscurity
in
ceaseless
flow
has
steadily
gained
in
population
and
never
lost
a
passionate
turbulent
soul
was
victor
de
jarnette
not
wholly
bad
certainly
capable
of
much
that
was
generous
productive
of
little
that
was
worth
perpetuating
not
lacking
in
good
impulses
but
casting
them
oftener
than
otherwise
in
a
mould
of
wax
which
melted
at
the
first
hot
blast
of
passion
a
mixture
like
most
of
us
perhaps
of
good
and
evil
black
and
white
but
alas
the
evil
that
men
do
lives
after
them
the
good
is
oft
interred
with
their
bones
that
night
margaret
de
jarnette
sat
long
before
the
grate
fire
of
the
lonely
house
to
which
she
had
come
a
bride
looking
into
the
darkening
coals
and
seeing
nothing
looking
into
the
embers
of
a
dead
fire
within
and
finding
much
that
had
burned
out
she
lived
relentlessly
over
the
past
two
years
putting
to
herself
searching
questions
and
exacting
an
answer
to
every
one
going
down
into
black
depths
of
whose
existence
she
once
had
not
dreamed
and
coming
up
with
staring
frightened
eyes
from
which
the
scales
of
innocence
had
dropped
then
she
drew
a
long
shuddering
breath
that
book
is
closed
she
whispered
never
to
be
opened
again
my
girlhood
is
put
away
with
it
i
am
old
old
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
beside
her
sleeping
child
but
oh
my
baby
my
little
one
my
blessed
one
i
have
you
i
have
you
semple
richard
de
jarnette
said
abruptly
as
he
and
his
friend
sat
together
that
night
a
long
silence
had
fallen
between
them
could
a
wound
like
that
be
in
god
name
tell
me
the
truth
it
was
the
question
semple
had
been
dreading
for
three
days
he
had
thought
of
several
ways
to
evade
it
when
it
came
there
was
something
in
the
haggard
face
of
the
man
before
him
that
would
not
be
denied
no
he
said
simply
it
would
be
a
physical
impossibility
chapter
xi
the
will
it
was
two
weeks
or
more
after
the
burial
of
victor
de
jarnette
before
his
will
was
read
jarvis
the
attorney
in
whose
charge
it
had
been
left
had
been
absent
from
the
city
at
the
time
of
the
unfortunate
affair
and
the
hearing
of
the
will
had
of
necessity
been
postponed
until
his
return
this
was
a
matter
of
very
little
concern
to
margaret
it
seemed
to
her
rather
a
useless
formality
anyway
this
coming
together
to
hear
the
provisions
of
a
legal
instrument
that
could
have
but
one
outcome
the
money
would
go
to
philip
of
course
judge
kirtley
had
talked
to
her
about
her
dower
rights
and
a
child
part
and
several
other
things
that
she
did
not
in
the
least
understand
but
she
only
shook
her
head
she
had
a
great
abundance
of
money
she
told
him
for
her
own
needs
and
philip
too
for
that
matter
and
she
had
determined
to
turn
over
to
her
child
at
once
whatever
legally
came
to
her
she
had
a
shuddering
feeling
that
she
did
not
want
to
use
money
let
it
all
go
to
philip
in
fact
margaret
had
always
been
so
far
removed
from
any
care
in
regard
to
money
except
the
spending
of
it
that
her
ideas
on
the
subject
were
very
vague
and
impractical
she
had
always
had
all
the
money
she
wanted
or
could
possibly
use
and
what
would
anybody
want
with
more
than
that
avarice
is
the
vice
of
age
rather
than
of
youth
and
margaret
certainly
was
not
avaricious
she
had
spent
this
fortnight
in
adjusting
herself
to
new
conditions
when
the
first
horror
of
it
all
passed
she
became
aware
that
a
great
load
was
lifted
from
her
heart
there
was
nothing
to
do
there
was
no
choice
pressing
upon
her
everything
was
settled
and
that
by
no
act
of
hers
there
was
no
danger
now
of
trouble
about
philip
and
the
sharp
relief
she
experienced
at
this
thought
made
her
aware
of
what
a
fear
that
had
begun
to
be
no
that
was
over
now
thank
god
and
she
caught
up
the
child
in
a
passion
of
relief
there
was
something
infinitely
touching
about
the
girl
in
these
days
when
she
stood
looking
at
the
wreck
of
her
life
it
was
so
different
from
what
she
had
thought
it
would
be
so
different
she
wondered
vaguely
if
other
people
most
people
saw
their
ships
go
down
like
this
the
sea
around
her
was
filled
with
wreckage
there
was
nothing
now
but
to
gather
up
the
scattered
bits
and
with
such
courage
as
she
could
summon
piece
out
another
life
a
very
quiet
subdued
one
this
would
be
with
philip
as
its
center
it
would
be
colorless
perhaps
she
shivered
slightly
she
was
not
quite
and
color
had
not
lost
its
charm
but
it
would
at
least
be
peaceful
then
as
thought
projected
itself
into
the
future
and
she
saw
this
opening
bud
grow
to
the
perfect
flower
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
would
not
only
be
peaceful
but
satisfying
now
he
was
a
rolicking
boy
and
she
would
see
to
it
that
he
missed
none
of
life
pleasures
that
had
not
a
sting
now
he
was
a
lad
at
school
she
standing
by
his
side
thinking
his
thoughts
and
leading
him
on
to
think
hers
she
would
keep
very
very
close
to
him
her
little
philip
then
a
youth
at
college
could
she
let
him
go
away
for
that
and
now
a
man
fitted
for
useful
life
and
with
his
strong
arm
shielding
her
his
mother
who
had
shielded
him
smoothing
the
pathway
for
her
feet
as
she
went
down
life
hill
ah
through
it
all
how
she
would
guard
him
guide
him
carry
him
by
sheer
force
of
across
the
slippery
places
that
his
feet
would
find
his
father
and
her
thought
of
him
a
motherless
boy
grew
tender
his
father
had
missed
this
perhaps
if
he
had
had
it
well
she
would
make
it
up
to
philip
his
child
at
any
rate
she
would
try
to
keep
him
pure
this
with
a
sudden
sinking
sense
of
her
own
helplessness
the
first
regret
came
to
her
that
it
was
a
son
she
had
and
not
a
daughter
a
daughter
she
could
keep
with
her
while
a
son
must
of
necessity
go
out
into
the
world
and
the
world
she
thought
with
a
pang
was
so
full
of
peril
of
temptation
the
more
she
pondered
it
the
more
her
soul
was
girded
for
her
work
to
mould
a
life
this
was
what
was
left
her
well
was
it
not
enough
to
find
her
chief
happiness
not
in
living
her
own
but
in
fashioning
another
life
then
to
something
that
spoke
within
her
she
made
answer
yes
of
course
it
will
be
lonely
but
a
fragment
of
a
fugitive
poem
she
had
once
read
came
to
her
lonely
well
and
what
of
that
she
could
not
recall
the
next
two
lines
such
scraps
are
so
elusive
but
it
did
not
matter
the
trumpet
call
of
the
thing
was
in
the
last
line
work
may
be
done
in
loneliness
work
on
she
bowed
her
head
over
the
crib
on
which
lay
her
sleeping
child
she
took
his
soft
dimpled
hand
between
her
palms
yes
it
is
lonely
little
philip
she
whispered
brokenly
it
will
always
be
lonely
but
may
be
done
in
loneliness
i
begin
again
dear
and
map
out
another
life
and
we
will
live
it
together
you
and
i
and
we
will
make
it
just
as
sweet
and
full
a
life
as
we
can
for
have
you
and
you
have
me
we
wo
be
gloomy
or
sad
we
will
not
ourselves
be
nothing
shall
cast
a
shadow
over
this
little
life
we
are
going
to
live
it
is
ours
we
will
make
it
the
brightest
and
the
best
thing
we
can
we
have
a
right
to
be
happy
and
we
will
be
nobody
shall
keep
us
from
it
little
philip
it
was
in
this
mood
of
quiet
exaltation
that
she
went
down
stairs
to
the
reading
of
the
will
a
little
later
when
the
lawyer
came
she
had
not
seen
her
since
the
funeral
to
judge
kirtley
unspeakable
indignation
de
jarnette
had
not
even
returned
to
the
house
with
her
at
this
lack
of
civility
to
say
nothing
of
brotherly
kindness
she
was
surprised
and
hurt
but
she
clothed
herself
in
her
impenetrable
garment
of
silence
regarding
it
and
made
no
comment
judge
kirtley
had
not
been
so
reticent
to
his
wife
he
had
said
with
some
heat
he
is
the
most
incomprehensible
man
i
ever
saw
i
know
he
is
undemonstrative
by
nature
but
up
to
this
time
he
really
has
not
been
lacking
in
substantial
kindness
to
margaret
i
judge
so
from
what
she
tells
me
particularly
when
victor
first
went
away
and
she
most
needed
help
but
since
his
death
when
one
would
have
expected
him
to
stand
by
her
he
has
stood
aloof
i
ca
understand
it
he
certainly
is
not
an
emotional
man
nor
an
impulsive
one
there
is
something
back
of
this
can
she
have
offended
him
by
anything
she
has
said
and
still
she
has
been
so
very
reticent
no
said
the
judge
it
is
that
i
am
sure
i
have
sometimes
wondered
if
it
could
be
he
was
patting
his
foot
thoughtfully
and
talking
more
to
himself
than
to
her
that
he
had
some
suspicion
that
victor
death
was
by
his
own
hand
intentionally
i
mean
and
held
margaret
responsible
for
it
as
the
result
of
their
interview
and
what
that
was
we
will
never
know
said
his
wife
with
the
tone
of
one
airing
a
grievance
no
and
never
should
her
husband
responded
quickly
she
shows
her
sense
there
i
have
wondered
i
say
if
he
can
hold
such
a
thought
as
that
against
her
it
is
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
that
would
at
all
excuse
his
conduct
did
victor
make
a
dying
statement
that
it
was
accidental
yes
a
sworn
statement
no
but
a
dying
declaration
has
almost
as
much
weight
then
of
course
it
was
the
truth
would
that
be
perjury
or
something
like
that
to
make
a
false
statement
at
such
a
time
well
you
see
the
judge
responded
dryly
victor
de
jarnette
was
going
where
he
would
be
in
no
danger
of
being
tried
for
perjury
even
admitting
that
it
would
have
been
that
which
it
would
then
feeling
that
he
had
been
a
little
indiscreet
in
thus
thinking
aloud
before
the
wife
of
his
bosom
who
did
not
enjoy
quite
all
his
confidence
he
added
i
think
you
are
right
my
dear
it
was
a
foolish
thought
in
me
it
certainly
was
answered
kirtley
pursuing
the
advantage
of
this
concession
to
her
superior
wisdom
foolish
and
wild
of
course
it
was
an
accident
why
was
the
rag
there
that
he
had
been
cleaning
the
pistol
with
it
was
well
triumphantly
you
are
right
again
that
settles
it
said
the
judge
chuckling
to
himself
you
ought
to
have
been
a
lawyer
my
dear
or
a
detective
oh
i
can
see
a
thing
when
it
is
his
wife
said
modestly
the
three
gentlemen
de
jarnette
judge
kirtley
and
jarvis
were
in
the
library
when
margaret
entered
it
the
latter
being
nearest
the
door
rose
and
extended
his
hand
in
grave
courteous
greeting
de
jarnette
the
table
between
them
bowed
while
judge
kirtley
took
her
affectionately
by
the
hand
and
drew
her
to
a
chair
beside
him
she
was
clothed
in
black
relieved
by
white
at
neck
and
wrists
there
was
something
about
her
slight
girlish
form
and
youthful
face
that
made
the
attorney
with
the
legal
document
in
his
hand
draw
a
quick
deep
breath
and
give
an
unnoticed
movement
of
the
head
as
if
in
protest
and
are
you
well
asked
the
judge
patting
her
hand
and
smiling
into
her
eyes
there
is
something
very
to
a
novice
in
a
visit
from
a
lawyer
with
a
legal
document
in
his
hand
oh
yes
quite
well
thank
you
her
hands
were
cold
he
said
to
give
her
time
to
recover
herself
and
how
is
the
boy
her
face
lighted
up
as
from
a
burst
of
sunshine
doing
nicely
thank
you
growing
every
day
in
strength
and
accomplishments
why
he
actually
travels
around
chairs
faster
than
we
want
to
travel
after
him
that
right
he
lead
you
a
merry
chase
when
he
finds
out
his
powers
yes
and
he
is
finding
them
out
very
rapidly
he
is
going
to
be
a
real
boy
so
strong
and
active
he
is
great
company
for
you
judge
kirtley
said
and
will
be
more
as
time
goes
on
i
know
how
these
little
things
creep
into
one
heart
you
know
i
lost
my
boy
it
was
forty
years
since
then
but
his
eyes
grew
moist
as
he
thought
of
the
son
who
might
have
been
his
stay
and
was
but
a
tender
memory
her
hand
closed
over
his
it
must
be
very
hard
to
lose
a
child
she
said
softly
i
i
think
i
could
not
bear
that
they
come
so
they
were
talking
almost
in
an
undertone
richard
de
jarnette
had
left
the
room
to
speak
to
his
driver
at
the
door
the
lawyer
a
man
with
children
of
his
own
was
fumbling
over
the
papers
in
his
bag
saying
helplessly
oh
lord
lord
when
de
jarnette
returned
margaret
released
her
hand
gently
and
sat
upright
then
the
reading
began
the
will
was
dated
may
two
days
after
their
marriage
margaret
remembered
victor
coming
home
that
day
and
telling
her
that
he
had
made
it
and
had
left
everything
to
her
remembered
too
how
she
had
clung
passionately
to
him
in
the
superstitious
fear
of
what
a
will
might
bring
and
said
that
she
did
not
want
his
money
she
wanted
him
yes
the
date
was
the
same
and
as
the
reading
proceeded
she
saw
through
all
the
tiresome
verbiage
that
it
was
just
as
he
had
said
all
was
left
to
his
beloved
wife
margaret
richard
de
jarnette
was
named
as
executor
the
lawyer
paused
as
if
this
were
the
end
though
he
still
held
the
paper
a
little
unsteadily
before
him
it
seemed
to
judge
kirtley
watching
from
the
depths
of
his
chair
that
the
paper
shook
margaret
voice
broke
the
stillness
that
followed
the
reading
of
the
will
i
do
not
know
that
this
is
the
time
or
place
to
do
this
she
began
with
hesitation
but
when
this
will
was
written
there
was
no
child
now
that
there
is
i
wish
to
transfer
this
property
to
him
i
have
enough
margaret
the
judge
interrupted
the
law
takes
care
of
that
though
there
is
no
mention
of
a
child
he
would
share
with
you
i
want
him
to
have
it
all
she
said
i
i
could
not
keep
this
money
for
myself
i
would
not
wish
to
use
it
she
turned
to
look
at
judge
kirtley
who
was
at
her
right
and
as
she
did
so
met
richard
de
jarnette
steady
gaze
there
was
something
so
intent
so
inexplicable
in
his
eyes
a
look
so
like
hate
or
scorn
or
distrust
something
at
least
that
she
had
never
seen
there
before
that
involuntarily
she
dropped
her
eyes
what
had
she
said
what
made
him
look
like
that
there
was
something
in
that
look
that
froze
her
blood
judge
kirtley
as
her
lawyer
spoke
authoritatively
there
is
time
enough
to
attend
to
all
that
later
these
things
should
never
be
done
with
precipitation
and
margaret
who
had
not
yet
recovered
from
that
startling
look
into
richard
de
jarnette
heart
and
was
moreover
oppressed
with
the
fear
that
she
had
done
a
thing
judge
kirtley
disapproved
subsided
into
silence
the
voice
of
jarvis
was
heard
i
regret
to
say
he
remarked
slowly
and
with
his
eyes
bent
religiously
on
the
paper
that
there
is
a
codicil
to
this
will
bearing
date
of
april
of
the
following
year
no
one
can
deprecate
more
than
i
the
painful
duty
that
devolves
upon
me
of
reading
it
in
this
presence
judge
kirtley
sat
up
in
his
easy
chair
scenting
danger
it
was
unusual
for
an
attorney
to
apologize
for
a
will
but
margaret
was
motionless
she
was
thinking
of
the
date
it
was
the
day
victor
left
her
two
days
before
philip
was
born
then
the
attorney
read
my
beloved
brother
richard
de
jarnette
who
has
been
to
me
a
father
i
give
and
bequeath
the
custody
and
tuition
of
my
child
until
it
shall
be
of
full
age
and
i
direct
that
such
disposition
shall
be
good
and
effectual
against
all
and
every
person
or
persons
claiming
the
custody
and
tuition
of
said
for
a
moment
there
was
not
a
sound
it
was
margaret
again
who
broke
the
silence
she
turned
to
judge
kirtley
a
look
of
bewilderment
on
her
face
but
no
alarm
she
repeated
simply
what
does
it
mean
by
is
it
the
care
of
the
property
the
judge
face
looked
gray
in
its
rigidity
he
shook
his
head
slightly
and
then
motioned
toward
jarvis
de
jarnette
attorney
will
explain
he
said
briefly
margaret
turned
to
the
lawyer
who
still
held
the
paper
in
his
hand
you
see
i
am
very
ignorant
of
legal
terms
she
said
with
a
pitiful
little
attempt
at
apology
i
have
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
law
and
i
do
not
quite
understand
what
means
here
is
it
that
de
jarnette
is
by
this
codicil
appointed
philip
guardian
to
take
care
of
his
property
the
attorney
did
not
look
up
from
the
papers
he
was
fingering
indeed
as
she
looked
from
one
to
another
in
her
perplexity
margaret
saw
only
averted
faces
there
was
not
one
that
was
ready
to
look
into
her
anxious
pleading
eyes
de
jarnette
said
the
attorney
moistening
his
dry
lips
this
means
something
more
serious
than
that
or
rather
it
would
if
de
jarnette
were
inclined
to
insist
upon
the
letter
of
the
law
which
of
course
he
will
not
do
with
a
rather
imploring
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
gentleman
referred
to
de
jarnette
sat
unmoved
and
immovable
not
showing
by
the
change
of
a
muscle
that
he
heard
the
appeal
and
the
lawyer
went
on
custody
in
this
sense
does
not
mean
the
guardianship
of
property
but
of
the
person
there
was
another
silence
then
margaret
eyes
staring
breath
coming
hard
hands
clenched
and
face
white
as
death
spoke
do
you
mean
she
said
slowly
and
in
a
voice
that
trembled
with
suppressed
passion
that
my
child
has
been
willed
away
from
me
from
me
his
mother
that
this
man
or
any
man
can
have
the
right
by
law
to
take
him
from
me
baby
oh
no
you
do
mean
this
i
was
mad
to
think
of
it
but
you
see
i
am
so
inexperienced
but
de
jarnette
returned
the
lawyer
feeling
his
task
harder
even
than
he
had
feared
i
am
obliged
to
tell
you
much
as
i
regret
to
do
so
that
it
is
true
there
is
a
most
unfortunate
law
in
this
district
not
to
call
it
by
a
harsher
name
which
gives
a
father
the
right
to
will
away
his
child
even
from
its
mother
that
law
your
late
husband
unfortunately
knew
about
and
in
a
moment
of
great
anger
and
as
he
claimed
of
great
provocation
he
used
that
knowledge
as
we
have
seen
to
stab
the
woman
he
had
sworn
to
cherish
muttered
judge
kirtley
under
his
breath
then
reaching
for
the
will
he
asked
sternly
were
all
the
requirements
of
the
law
complied
with
in
regard
to
witnesses
yes
sir
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
nothing
has
been
omitted
that
would
give
validity
to
the
will
or
rather
to
this
codicil
then
i
am
constrained
to
say
blurted
the
judge
that
it
was
a
dastardly
thing
i
think
i
should
say
in
justice
to
myself
said
jarvis
a
little
stiffly
that
i
made
every
effort
to
dissuade
de
jarnette
from
doing
this
thing
i
urged
him
to
wait
until
the
next
day
knowing
him
to
be
an
impulsive
man
and
feeling
sure
that
he
would
wish
afterwards
to
undo
what
he
had
done
but
he
would
not
listen
to
me
i
hoped
that
i
could
get
him
to
change
the
will
when
he
returned
and
i
can
hardly
doubt
that
he
would
have
done
so
had
it
not
been
for
the
unfortunate
accident
that
ended
his
life
margaret
had
been
listening
breathlessly
as
jarvis
stopped
she
turned
to
speak
to
judge
kirtley
and
again
encountered
the
steady
gaze
of
richard
de
jarnette
black
eyes
it
seemed
so
strange
so
unaccountable
for
him
to
watch
her
so
that
before
she
could
control
it
if
indeed
control
is
ever
possible
she
felt
a
hot
tide
sweeping
up
from
neck
to
brow
and
the
consciousness
of
this
did
not
lessen
the
flow
then
it
passed
and
left
her
paler
than
before
it
was
annoying
but
it
did
not
stop
her
in
what
she
had
to
say
a
new
thought
had
come
to
her
while
jarvis
was
speaking
what
is
the
date
of
that
codicil
she
asked
april
i
thought
so
she
said
eagerly
well
do
you
see
how
that
date
changes
everything
even
if
my
if
de
jarnette
had
had
the
right
by
law
to
will
away
my
child
he
could
not
have
done
it
on
april
for
philip
was
not
born
till
two
days
afterward
his
birthday
is
may
second
she
said
it
exultantly
as
by
one
impulse
the
two
lawyers
looked
each
into
the
face
of
the
other
and
then
away
do
you
see
she
cried
desperately
not
comprehending
the
look
but
knowing
instinctively
that
something
was
wrong
do
you
see
the
difference
that
makes
when
that
will
was
made
this
child
was
a
part
of
my
body
my
very
breath
giving
him
life
do
you
see
oh
you
see
he
would
have
the
right
to
make
this
will
then
her
voice
was
becoming
strained
and
in
her
excitement
de
jarnette
began
jarvis
the
law
i
should
say
yes
the
law
judge
you
can
explain
this
to
her
better
than
i
can
she
turned
to
judge
kirtley
she
was
in
extremity
now
my
child
he
said
the
law
as
it
distinctly
states
recognizes
in
this
thing
no
difference
between
the
living
child
and
the
infant
ventre
sa
your
husband
according
to
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia
had
a
right
to
will
away
your
unborn
child
she
stared
at
him
incredulously
then
as
the
meaning
of
his
words
sank
into
her
quivering
soul
she
bent
toward
him
with
a
look
that
had
a
challenge
in
it
and
have
you
known
this
before
always
and
you
she
demanded
turning
to
jarvis
yes
he
admitted
it
is
a
part
of
our
imperfect
laws
the
whole
thing
should
have
been
revised
long
ago
it
is
a
disgrace
to
the
district
then
does
it
remain
upon
your
statute
books
she
cried
furiously
is
law
only
for
the
strong
do
we
the
weak
the
ones
who
need
it
most
do
we
find
in
it
only
something
to
mock
us
when
we
cry
to
it
her
timidity
was
all
gone
she
flung
her
questions
at
them
tumultuously
as
children
stand
and
beat
impotently
upon
a
door
that
will
not
open
to
them
i
tell
you
it
is
a
wicked
law
a
wicked
wicked
law
and
they
do
wickedly
who
let
it
stand
mother
have
no
right
to
her
unborn
child
shame
shame
upon
the
men
who
frame
such
laws
they
are
not
born
of
women
but
of
beasts
margaret
judge
kirtley
said
sternly
you
must
control
yourself
this
is
no
place
for
a
discussion
of
our
laws
however
imperfect
they
are
i
beg
your
pardon
she
answered
with
a
flush
and
a
return
to
her
usual
manner
in
this
insult
to
womanhood
and
motherhood
i
forgot
myself
i
shall
not
do
so
again
only
tell
me
that
i
need
not
fear
that
my
baby
is
safe
with
me
as
she
spoke
she
turned
full
upon
richard
de
jarnette
though
she
did
not
call
his
name
he
looked
at
her
impassively
de
jarnette
said
jarvis
nervously
folding
up
his
papers
and
placing
them
in
his
satchel
i
think
you
can
do
more
to
add
to
your
peace
of
mind
than
anybody
else
can
will
you
not
tell
her
plainly
your
intentions
in
the
matter
i
will
said
richard
de
jarnette
a
sudden
fire
leaping
to
his
eyes
which
were
upon
margaret
then
he
turned
to
the
attorney
i
accept
the
trust
my
brother
has
bequeathed
to
me
and
shall
claim
the
child
saying
which
he
rose
bowed
slightly
and
left
the
room
chapter
xii
a
losing
fight
it
was
as
if
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
from
a
clear
sky
margaret
dropped
back
like
one
shot
judge
kirtley
and
the
attorney
looked
after
the
disappearing
figure
and
then
at
each
other
before
they
had
time
to
recover
from
their
astonishment
margaret
started
up
in
a
quiver
of
excitement
where
has
he
gone
is
he
after
philip
before
they
could
remonstrate
she
was
out
of
the
room
and
hurrying
up
the
stairs
had
you
any
knowledge
sir
of
the
stand
de
jarnette
was
going
to
take
demanded
judge
kirtley
sternly
not
the
slightest
it
is
as
much
of
a
surprise
to
me
as
to
you
did
he
know
the
nature
of
this
will
before
coming
here
i
think
not
he
certainly
did
not
know
it
from
me
and
i
have
reason
to
think
that
he
did
not
see
his
brother
after
it
was
made
until
the
day
he
returned
which
was
the
day
of
his
death
i
believe
it
was
i
was
out
of
the
city
at
the
time
and
did
not
see
victor
de
jarnette
after
this
codicil
was
added
april
thirtieth
i
wish
to
god
i
had
i
think
perhaps
i
could
have
persuaded
him
then
to
alter
it
he
had
had
a
good
many
months
in
which
to
cool
down
he
was
a
fellow
you
know
you
say
you
tried
to
argue
him
out
of
doing
it
in
the
first
place
i
used
every
effort
in
my
power
but
he
would
listen
to
nothing
i
never
saw
a
man
so
carried
away
by
passion
well
by
the
lord
sir
said
the
judge
bringing
his
fist
down
upon
the
table
i
believe
i
should
have
refused
to
draw
up
that
will
the
attorney
flushed
i
did
so
at
first
he
returned
quietly
but
he
insisted
that
if
i
would
not
do
it
he
could
get
somebody
that
would
which
of
course
i
knew
was
true
i
thought
that
when
he
had
had
time
to
think
it
over
he
would
feel
ashamed
of
it
and
want
to
change
it
and
i
felt
that
if
it
were
between
us
two
i
should
be
in
a
better
position
to
try
to
bring
this
about
than
if
it
had
gone
entirely
out
of
my
hands
there
is
something
in
that
admitted
the
judge
i
had
the
least
idea
that
he
was
going
off
i
wrote
to
him
when
i
found
out
where
he
was
and
urged
him
to
make
a
new
will
over
there
but
he
replied
that
he
would
attend
to
it
when
he
got
home
i
really
think
he
intended
to
do
it
but
you
know
how
he
was
cut
off
yes
that
it
we
never
have
the
warning
we
suppose
we
will
have
we
know
that
other
people
drop
dead
but
we
never
expect
to
do
it
ourselves
i
hope
you
are
right
for
it
is
rather
hard
for
me
to
forgive
victor
de
jarnette
living
he
made
her
life
wretched
and
from
the
grave
he
has
reached
up
to
strike
her
he
could
not
have
given
a
crueler
blow
than
this
and
the
other
one
i
tell
you
jarvis
that
man
is
going
to
give
us
trouble
were
you
amazed
at
the
stand
he
took
astounded
i
can
not
fathom
his
motive
nor
i
returned
the
judge
helplessly
but
as
sure
as
you
are
a
living
man
he
means
business
i
would
tell
margaret
so
but
i
believe
there
will
be
any
from
this
we
have
to
fight
it
out
in
the
courts
poor
child
she
has
had
trouble
enough
to
break
the
spirit
of
an
ordinary
woman
do
you
know
the
de
jarnettes
intimately
asked
jarvis
i
was
wondering
what
would
be
the
best
way
to
reach
him
i
know
them
well
said
the
judge
energetically
better
than
i
wish
i
did
i
would
have
more
hope
of
a
peaceable
settlement
of
this
thing
if
i
knew
less
there
is
a
cruel
streak
in
the
de
jarnettes
you
have
seen
it
in
victor
and
i
have
seen
it
in
his
father
and
it
was
in
his
grandfather
before
him
they
never
forgive
and
they
never
forget
an
injury
to
any
of
the
blood
i
believe
that
is
why
richard
de
jarnette
had
taken
this
stand
i
think
he
must
consider
her
in
some
way
responsible
for
his
brother
going
wrong
you
know
there
are
men
who
always
charge
everything
to
a
woman
i
ca
see
anything
else
that
would
account
for
his
change
of
front
judge
the
attorney
said
hurriedly
he
was
expecting
margaret
at
any
moment
what
are
you
going
to
do
of
course
you
will
represent
de
jarnette
you
will
fight
fight
judge
kirtley
drew
his
somewhat
stooping
figure
up
to
its
full
measure
yes
sir
we
will
fight
to
the
death
i
am
an
old
war
horse
to
be
going
into
battle
but
i
hope
there
is
one
fight
left
in
me
see
anyway
i
should
not
like
to
be
your
opponent
sir
and
i
tell
you
this
shall
not
the
laws
of
the
district
are
against
us
said
judge
kirtley
reflectively
that
a
damnable
law
jarvis
the
whole
thing
is
rotten
answered
the
attorney
the
district
of
columbia
has
laws
on
her
statute
books
that
would
make
her
a
laughing
stock
for
civilized
communities
if
they
were
generally
known
this
is
one
of
the
most
infamous
but
there
are
others
just
as
unreasonable
the
whole
thing
ought
to
be
plowed
up
and
weeded
out
god
speed
the
day
i
suppose
that
child
will
hold
her
baby
in
her
arms
all
night
fearing
at
every
sound
that
richard
de
jarnette
is
coming
to
drag
him
away
from
her
and
i
do
feel
sure
that
he
would
if
he
got
a
chance
the
trouble
about
these
silent
fellows
is
that
you
never
know
what
they
are
going
to
do
next
what
will
be
his
next
move
do
you
suppose
have
the
will
probated
i
suppose
and
have
himself
confirmed
as
guardian
and
executor
and
then
oh
the
lord
knows
judge
i
do
what
could
a
man
do
with
a
child
of
that
age
it
is
spite
work
nothing
short
of
it
he
put
his
papers
carefully
away
do
you
think
de
jarnette
is
coming
down
i
shall
have
to
be
going
set
me
right
with
her
about
this
matter
will
you
i
regret
exceedingly
to
have
had
any
part
in
it
when
he
was
gone
judge
kirtley
sent
up
for
margaret
she
came
down
with
philip
in
her
arms
i
would
not
come
she
said
while
that
man
was
here
how
could
he
have
done
such
a
thing
and
oh
judge
kirtley
they
ca
take
him
from
me
can
they
is
there
such
a
cruel
law
as
that
it
seemed
crueler
to
him
than
ever
before
as
he
looked
at
the
slight
creature
clinging
to
her
child
there
really
is
such
a
law
i
have
never
seen
it
put
to
the
test
but
i
feel
sure
it
would
not
be
enforced
in
such
a
case
as
this
where
there
is
nothing
against
your
character
and
the
child
is
so
young
but
when
he
grows
older
she
said
quickly
could
he
take
him
then
that
would
have
to
be
tested
in
the
courts
margaret
you
may
feel
sure
of
my
doing
all
that
can
be
done
oh
i
do
i
do
but
it
is
so
dreadful
that
it
needs
to
be
done
why
should
he
want
philip
i
i
ca
understand
it
it
frightens
me
and
why
does
he
look
at
me
as
he
does
it
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
have
done
something
that
is
doubtless
all
imagination
but
how
long
have
you
noticed
this
the
judge
inquired
carelessly
ever
since
the
day
of
the
funeral
and
even
that
day
when
we
were
together
at
the
inquest
judge
kirtley
would
he
dare
to
harm
philip
if
he
could
get
hold
of
him
margaret
this
is
foolish
child
the
only
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
get
possession
of
the
child
as
testamentary
guardian
by
due
process
of
law
and
that
is
always
long
and
if
he
got
him
and
i
could
only
get
him
back
by
due
process
of
law
would
that
be
long
too
yes
that
might
be
longer
still
for
being
his
legal
guardian
he
would
have
the
law
presumably
on
his
side
but
my
dear
we
wo
cross
that
bridge
he
has
got
him
yet
i
do
believe
there
is
a
court
on
earth
certainly
not
in
this
district
that
would
take
your
child
from
you
cheer
up
we
fight
it
out
if
worst
comes
to
worst
she
did
not
smile
do
you
think
it
is
because
he
wants
the
money
i
have
thought
of
that
of
course
it
generally
is
because
of
money
that
most
of
the
deviltry
is
done
but
i
had
never
thought
he
was
that
kind
of
man
oh
i
hope
it
is
that
would
make
it
all
so
simple
ca
you
find
out
if
it
is
and
tell
him
to
take
it
all
of
it
i
do
want
the
money
only
he
must
give
up
all
claim
to
philip
nonsense
margaret
said
the
judge
testily
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
you
have
no
right
to
relinquish
this
money
either
your
own
or
philip
it
is
willed
to
you
and
it
ought
to
stand
yes
but
the
same
will
that
gives
me
the
money
gives
him
philip
oh
why
did
victor
do
this
wicked
thing
as
he
went
away
judge
kirtley
said
i
shall
go
to
de
jarnette
and
see
what
i
can
do
toward
settling
it
out
of
court
i
think
it
will
turn
out
all
right
i
have
great
faith
that
he
can
be
brought
to
see
it
in
the
right
light
and
if
he
ca
and
it
has
to
go
into
the
courts
margaret
looked
hopelessly
at
him
the
case
seemed
lost
already
so
powerful
and
fearful
a
thing
is
the
law
to
the
inexperienced
you
must
remember
always
that
in
any
proceedings
concerning
the
custody
of
children
even
in
the
absence
of
any
express
statute
the
court
is
obliged
to
consider
the
welfare
of
the
child
as
paramount
to
every
other
consideration
and
it
has
the
power
even
to
take
a
child
away
from
its
guardian
if
that
seems
best
for
the
child
but
in
this
case
it
seems
that
there
is
an
express
statute
or
law
or
whatever
it
is
said
margaret
who
had
been
listening
with
all
the
powers
of
a
mind
unused
to
legal
terms
and
technicalities
and
that
it
is
against
the
mother
that
does
not
make
it
certain
that
the
courts
would
sustain
the
will
the
court
is
always
apt
to
favor
the
claim
of
the
mother
unless
it
can
be
proved
that
she
is
an
improper
person
to
have
charge
of
it
so
cheer
up
my
child
she
was
standing
before
him
with
the
boy
who
laughed
and
crowed
unheeded
in
her
arms
but
if
he
should
come
when
you
are
gone
and
try
to
take
him
she
said
her
eyes
big
with
fright
what
could
i
do
margaret
he
will
not
come
you
need
not
fear
it
in
the
least
richard
de
jarnette
would
not
go
against
the
law
to
secure
your
child
even
if
he
can
not
be
persuaded
to
give
him
up
how
can
i
tell
what
is
law
she
cried
passionately
if
anybody
had
told
me
yesterday
that
the
law
gave
a
man
a
right
to
will
away
my
child
before
it
was
born
i
should
have
said
he
was
mad
and
when
this
other
man
comes
and
demands
that
child
as
he
will
i
know
he
will
how
am
i
to
know
that
the
law
does
not
give
him
the
power
to
take
him
because
i
am
telling
you
now
that
it
does
not
you
can
trust
me
if
you
ca
the
law
that
is
the
danger
to
be
feared
what
is
she
asked
quickly
just
what
i
was
telling
you
that
after
due
process
of
law
the
court
might
decide
in
favor
of
his
claim
if
he
should
press
it
and
i
believe
he
will
he
will
she
said
hopelessly
i
know
he
will
you
do
know
how
vindictively
he
looked
at
me
it
was
useless
to
argue
against
such
logic
as
this
and
he
went
away
when
he
was
gone
margaret
had
the
great
door
locked
and
bolted
and
gave
orders
that
no
one
should
be
admitted
that
night
she
slept
fitfully
philip
in
her
arms
chapter
xiii
the
wolf
blood
it
was
not
until
the
next
day
that
judge
kirtley
went
to
see
de
jarnette
i
will
give
him
an
opportunity
to
sleep
over
it
he
told
his
wife
a
man
sober
second
thought
is
always
in
the
morning
but
richard
de
jarnette
sleep
had
not
been
long
enough
nor
sound
enough
to
change
his
mind
the
stubbornness
of
the
man
is
incredible
the
judge
reported
when
he
got
home
he
going
to
make
us
trouble
i
can
see
that
he
makes
no
accusation
against
margaret
he
does
try
in
the
least
to
defame
her
character
but
he
says
his
brother
undoubtedly
had
sufficient
reasons
for
making
such
a
will
and
that
he
shall
carry
out
his
wishes
i
suppose
the
small
matter
of
margaret
having
borne
the
child
is
no
reason
why
he
should
consult
wishes
said
kirtley
indignantly
apparently
not
he
simply
ignores
her
what
could
he
do
with
a
baby
he
ca
take
care
of
it
i
ca
see
why
he
wants
it
it
is
that
he
wants
it
this
is
not
affection
but
for
some
reason
he
is
determined
that
margaret
shall
not
have
it
it
is
a
spirit
no
the
judge
said
thoughtfully
it
is
that
from
long
habit
his
judicial
mind
was
weighing
evidence
on
both
sides
i
am
convinced
that
he
has
some
reason
for
this
but
so
far
i
have
been
able
to
get
at
it
i
asked
him
plainly
if
he
had
anything
against
margaret
he
said
he
had
no
accusations
to
make
and
indeed
i
do
see
that
he
could
make
any
if
ever
in
a
case
like
this
a
woman
has
been
absolutely
blameless
that
woman
is
margaret
what
does
he
propose
to
do
with
the
child
i
asked
him
that
he
says
he
shall
leave
him
in
charge
of
the
old
woman
who
has
taken
care
of
him
all
his
life
but
he
intends
to
take
them
to
his
home
he
says
she
is
perfectly
competent
and
trustworthy
well
that
is
true
acknowledged
kirtley
i
never
saw
a
more
faithful
nurse
so
he
says
he
claims
that
margaret
has
herself
told
him
repeatedly
that
the
old
woman
knows
better
what
to
do
with
the
child
than
she
does
as
if
that
proved
anything
every
young
mother
has
to
learn
the
man
is
a
brute
will
he
take
philip
at
once
oh
no
a
will
must
always
be
admitted
to
probate
before
anybody
can
have
any
rights
under
it
and
when
it
is
we
will
be
there
to
contest
it
have
you
talked
with
margaret
no
she
is
to
come
to
the
office
this
afternoon
when
he
laid
the
case
before
her
there
margaret
listened
in
silence
her
excitement
of
the
day
before
was
gone
in
fact
judge
kirtley
would
have
been
glad
to
see
her
more
moved
than
she
was
her
calmness
seemed
almost
like
despair
i
knew
he
would
not
do
it
she
said
he
means
us
harm
well
just
for
the
present
my
dear
i
seem
to
have
been
unsuccessful
but
i
have
by
no
means
given
up
hope
of
its
being
compromised
what
reason
does
he
give
for
persisting
in
taking
philip
from
me
none
at
all
he
simply
falls
back
on
the
will
and
says
he
wants
to
carry
out
his
brother
wishes
there
is
some
reason
she
said
positively
he
hates
me
for
what
cause
i
can
not
tell
i
have
felt
it
since
the
day
victor
died
he
has
avoided
me
ever
since
i
am
of
and
yet
i
feel
powerless
before
a
fear
that
can
not
even
be
defined
why
should
he
hate
me
i
think
that
is
imagination
are
you
willing
to
talk
with
him
why
certainly
very
well
then
i
shall
arrange
for
you
to
see
him
in
his
private
office
then
they
fell
to
talking
about
the
will
and
margaret
said
hesitatingly
judge
kirtley
are
you
sure
it
would
make
any
difference
philip
not
being
born
when
the
will
was
made
i
mean
it
seems
as
if
it
must
make
a
difference
he
went
to
the
library
and
took
down
the
statute
book
turning
to
chapter
xxvii
section
one
and
read
sec
that
when
any
person
hath
or
shall
have
any
child
or
children
under
the
age
of
one
and
twenty
years
and
not
married
at
the
time
of
his
death
that
it
shall
and
may
be
lawful
to
and
for
the
father
of
such
child
or
children
whether
born
at
the
time
of
the
decease
of
the
father
or
at
that
time
in
sa
or
whether
such
father
be
within
the
age
of
one
and
twenty
years
or
of
full
age
by
his
deed
executed
in
his
lifetime
or
by
his
last
will
and
testament
in
writing
in
the
presence
of
two
or
more
credible
witnesses
in
such
manner
and
from
time
to
time
as
he
shall
respectively
think
fit
to
dispose
of
the
custody
and
tuition
of
such
child
or
children
for
and
during
such
time
as
he
and
they
shall
respectively
remain
under
the
age
of
one
and
twenty
years
or
any
lesser
time
to
any
person
or
persons
in
possession
or
remainder
other
than
popish
recusants
she
listened
carefully
as
he
closed
the
book
she
said
scathingly
i
do
wonder
they
put
it
in
a
foreign
tongue
that
would
sound
very
harsh
in
english
then
after
a
moment
she
asked
judge
kirtley
how
does
it
happen
that
such
an
infamous
law
was
ever
put
upon
our
statute
books
that
is
a
long
story
margaret
or
rather
there
are
links
in
the
chain
that
go
back
a
long
way
it
does
take
much
time
in
the
telling
he
was
glad
to
turn
her
thoughts
into
a
slightly
different
channel
you
see
when
maryland
ceded
the
district
of
columbia
to
the
united
states
for
a
permanent
seat
of
government
it
was
provided
by
an
act
of
congress
that
all
the
laws
of
the
state
of
maryland
as
they
then
existed
should
be
and
continued
in
force
in
the
district
or
at
least
such
part
of
it
as
had
been
ceded
by
that
state
did
maryland
have
such
a
law
asked
margaret
incredulously
yes
maryland
and
a
good
many
of
the
other
states
the
older
ones
particularly
they
have
been
gradually
modifying
these
laws
in
a
number
of
them
but
how
did
they
ever
happen
to
have
such
a
law
in
the
first
place
she
interrupted
i
did
not
dream
that
such
things
would
be
tolerated
in
this
age
the
explanation
is
simple
enough
when
the
english
emigrants
came
to
this
country
and
founded
commonwealths
they
brought
with
them
the
language
the
laws
and
the
institutions
of
the
mother
country
these
had
only
to
be
modified
and
adapted
to
changed
conditions
that
they
found
here
then
this
is
really
an
english
law
an
english
law
dating
back
to
the
time
of
charles
ii
it
was
originally
framed
to
prevent
the
catholics
from
obtaining
possession
of
the
children
of
a
protestant
father
i
believe
it
sounds
as
if
it
might
have
gone
back
to
the
dark
ages
said
margaret
indignantly
or
to
barbarism
it
seems
so
strange
that
i
have
never
heard
of
it
before
not
at
all
most
people
do
not
know
about
laws
until
they
are
touched
by
them
you
say
some
of
the
states
have
repealed
this
law
why
did
they
do
it
oh
they
found
it
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
age
i
suppose
i
guess
the
women
rights
people
prodded
them
up
a
little
maybe
judge
kirtley
said
margaret
after
a
pause
in
which
her
mind
had
gone
from
women
rights
to
women
wrongs
do
you
suppose
many
women
are
forced
to
give
up
their
children
under
this
law
not
many
of
your
kind
margaret
perhaps
not
many
of
any
kind
but
it
is
a
thing
well
known
that
many
brutal
men
know
of
this
law
and
hold
it
as
a
club
over
their
wives
a
lazy
negro
for
instance
will
often
make
his
wife
support
him
here
in
the
district
where
there
are
so
many
of
them
by
using
this
threat
oh
it
is
cruel
cruel
she
cried
her
voice
trembling
with
indignation
margaret
i
think
judging
from
your
face
just
now
that
if
you
were
a
man
you
would
say
of
this
law
as
lincoln
did
of
slavery
i
ever
get
a
chance
at
that
institution
hit
it
i
would
i
would
if
i
were
a
man
but
what
can
a
woman
do
but
suffer
some
of
them
learn
to
fight
he
said
enough
at
least
to
defend
their
young
it
was
in
her
mind
to
ask
him
further
questions
but
he
forestalled
them
you
better
go
home
now
child
and
think
no
more
about
it
for
a
while
i
will
see
de
jarnette
and
arrange
to
go
with
you
to
his
office
this
meeting
never
took
place
judge
kirtley
went
to
margaret
home
just
before
night
to
tell
her
that
de
jarnette
had
declined
to
talk
it
over
with
her
it
could
be
settled
much
more
satisfactorily
with
her
attorney
he
had
said
i
never
expected
him
to
do
it
margaret
said
shaking
as
with
a
chill
judge
kirtley
what
does
it
mean
why
does
he
shun
me
so
my
own
idea
margaret
is
that
he
is
afraid
to
risk
talking
it
over
with
you
for
fear
of
having
his
resolution
broken
down
by
your
tears
i
should
never
go
to
him
with
tears
said
margaret
with
flashing
eyes
i
think
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
for
you
not
to
go
remarked
judge
kirtley
prudently
i
believe
time
will
bring
it
right
anyway
and
do
let
your
fears
run
away
with
you
margaret
he
would
think
of
doing
anything
except
according
to
law
and
the
law
is
always
deliberate
after
the
will
is
filed
with
petition
for
probate
several
weeks
will
have
to
elapse
before
it
can
be
settled
even
if
it
is
settled
satisfactorily
to
all
concerned
if
we
find
there
is
going
to
be
trouble
this
will
give
us
time
to
decide
upon
our
line
of
procedure
we
may
have
to
contest
the
will
on
the
ground
that
it
is
unjust
no
a
will
can
be
contested
in
the
probate
court
only
on
the
ground
that
the
testator
was
of
unsound
mind
and
hence
incapable
of
making
a
will
or
that
he
was
unduly
influenced
by
the
way
have
you
ever
seen
anything
in
your
husband
that
would
lead
you
to
think
that
he
might
be
of
unsound
mind
no
said
margaret
after
a
moment
thought
not
a
thing
he
was
very
passionate
but
otherwise
perfectly
sane
and
have
you
any
reason
to
think
that
richard
de
jarnette
would
have
tried
to
influence
him
in
the
making
of
this
will
no
i
am
sure
he
would
never
have
done
it
it
would
not
have
been
in
the
least
like
him
well
margaret
said
the
judge
dryly
i
think
i
will
not
call
you
as
a
witness
in
this
case
just
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
the
unsound
mind
theory
might
be
successful
in
spite
of
what
you
say
these
fits
of
passion
that
you
speak
of
anger
is
a
madness
you
know
the
fact
that
his
mother
did
some
unexplained
things
and
then
his
unaccountable
desertion
of
you
well
we
will
see
it
seems
to
me
said
margaret
rather
timidly
that
the
plea
that
the
will
is
unjust
is
so
much
more
forcible
than
any
other
anybody
can
see
that
without
argument
it
is
very
true
but
the
law
recognizes
only
these
two
reasons
for
setting
aside
a
will
unfortunately
the
laws
of
this
district
permit
a
man
to
make
just
such
a
will
it
remains
for
us
only
to
prove
that
he
was
mentally
incapable
of
making
one
at
all
or
as
i
said
that
he
was
unduly
influenced
margaret
shook
her
head
and
sighed
she
did
not
believe
that
either
could
be
established
now
do
let
your
fears
run
away
with
you
margaret
be
sensible
de
jarnette
would
harm
philip
it
is
absurd
to
think
of
it
oh
i
afraid
there
is
no
telling
what
he
would
do
if
he
ever
got
hold
of
him
he
must
have
some
object
in
wanting
him
and
you
know
it
is
no
good
object
it
was
useless
to
reason
with
her
her
fears
had
placed
her
beyond
reason
he
went
away
promising
to
see
de
jarnette
again
when
he
was
gone
margaret
went
to
her
room
and
sat
down
her
strength
seemed
suddenly
gone
she
could
not
stand
her
head
was
dry
and
burning
and
her
hands
like
ice
a
thousand
fears
assailed
her
a
girl
of
shielded
from
contact
with
the
world
or
a
knowledge
of
its
wickedness
was
poorly
fitted
to
cope
with
such
fears
they
were
unreasonable
of
course
but
margaret
did
not
know
it
if
she
could
only
get
away
where
he
could
never
find
them
or
at
any
rate
until
philip
was
no
longer
a
baby
she
might
have
courage
to
face
it
when
he
was
a
few
years
older
but
a
baby
was
helpless
and
she
looked
despairingly
at
the
little
form
lying
there
in
the
unconscious
grace
of
sleep
the
soft
breath
parting
rosy
lips
and
the
moist
locks
clustering
in
rings
on
the
fair
forehead
oh
mammy
cely
she
cried
in
desperation
does
he
want
my
baby
the
black
woman
shook
her
head
there
had
been
no
secrecy
with
her
about
the
will
her
relations
with
the
mother
and
child
had
been
too
close
for
margaret
to
have
any
hesitation
about
telling
her
and
her
own
need
of
comfort
too
urgent
for
her
to
have
been
prudent
had
she
had
she
must
talk
to
somebody
so
mammy
cely
knew
the
whole
story
and
was
wrung
between
sympathy
for
margaret
and
loyalty
to
marse
richard
the
lord
knows
miss
margaret
she
said
shaking
her
head
it
beats
me
she
turned
away
and
began
arranging
the
shades
for
the
night
muttering
below
her
breath
as
she
did
so
hit
the
wolf
blood
that
what
it
is
what
did
you
say
mammy
cely
the
old
woman
made
no
reply
mammy
what
did
you
miss
margaret
i
do
want
to
tell
you
nothin
about
it
maybe
it
ai
so
anyway
maybe
what
is
so
margaret
curiosity
was
now
thoroughly
aroused
why
the
jarnettes
havin
wolf
hearts
that
what
they
used
to
say
i
do
know
but
i
reckon
it
so
i
thought
sho
marse
richard
was
gwineter
it
he
ain
never
showed
that
strain
befo
but
look
lak
it
a
curse
they
ca
git
shet
of
it
hit
there
fire
burn
it
and
water
ca
squinch
it
honey
it
was
marse
daddy
wha
sold
my
little
cass
away
from
me
your
baby
cried
margaret
in
horror
sold
your
baby
well
she
jes
as
you
might
say
a
baby
said
mammy
cely
with
scrupulous
exactness
but
she
was
the
onlies
one
i
had
and
when
a
mother
loses
a
child
specially
her
onlies
one
no
matter
how
old
it
is
it
her
baby
lak
she
always
goes
back
to
yaas
he
sold
her
down
south
it
more
than
thirty
years
sence
then
and
i
ai
never
seen
her
sence
oh
mammy
cely
how
could
you
it
mammy
cely
looked
at
her
with
dry
eyes
a
body
can
bear
a
heap
of
things
honey
they
think
they
ca
when
they
are
yo
age
i
bore
it
because
there
anything
else
to
do
that
why
people
bear
most
of
their
troubles
mammy
cely
tell
me
about
it
cried
margaret
impulsively
sit
down
and
tell
me
the
old
woman
took
the
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
crib
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
might
not
be
a
bad
thing
for
margaret
to
get
her
mind
upon
another
trouble
that
was
greater
than
her
own
perhaps
that
was
it
and
perhaps
she
wanted
to
tell
the
story
chapter
xiv
mammy
cely
story
i
have
always
lived
in
maryland
miss
margaret
aunt
cely
began
i
was

near

mighty
fine

was
they
no
po
white
trash
tell

what
with
the
old
dress
and
the
dirt
streaked
over
her
face
where
she
been
cryin
she
certainly
did
look
mo
lak
po
white
trash
than
a
decent
nigger
child
i
reckon
the
thought
so
too
for
he
tuk
a
good
look
at
her
and
he
says
ai
the
one
i
want
i
could
sell
her
to
nobody
miss
margaret
it
jes
seem
lak
my
heart
had
been

begun
to
bound
i
thought

got
her
off

but
what
do
you
suppose
that
child
done
then
she
looked
up
at

sorter
sassy

gal
you

pretty
but
mammy
done
cut
off
my
curls
miss
margaret
as
skeered
as
i
was
i
felt
lak
takin
that
child
and
shakin
her
good
here
she
was
in
the
worst
peril
a
gal
could
ever
be
in
and
losin
her
onlies
chance
of
gettin
out
because
she
was
afraid
a
would
think
she
was
ugly
i
declare
to
goodness
it
does
jes
look
lak
women
was
born
fools
anyway
most
of
would
rather
resk
fallin
into
the
hands
of
the
devil
hisself
than
to
resk
a
man
thinkin
they
ai
pretty
i
saw
in
a
minute
it
was
all
up
the
tuk
another
look
at
her
and
he
says
made
a
mistake
this
is
the
one
then
he
kinder
chuckled
to
hisself
and
says
a
cute
one
anyway
then
master
he
turned
to
me
and
says
i
sold
cass
get
her
ready
to
go
in
the
mornin
i
knowed
then
that
my
onlies
hope
was
in
him
and
i
got
down
on
my
knees
when
i
stopped
he
says
get
cass
ready
to
go
with
this
man
in
the
mornin
that
was
all
then
they
went
off
cass
went
cryin
kinder
sof
like
and
i
set
down
to
think
i
thought
once
i
take
her
and
we
steal
off
in
the
dark
and
hide
daytimes
and
travel
nights
tell
we
got
over
the
line
and
maybe
we
would
find
some
apples
or
something
to
live
on
i
thought
the
lord
would
keer
if
i
did
steal
ef
it
was
to
save
my
child
i
got
up
and
started
to
get
things
together
then
i
heared
the
bayin
of
old
man
dawson
hounds
and
i
set
down
again
i
thought
once
i
go
to
miss
julia
but
when
old
major
de
jarnette
had
that
look
on
his
face
there
anybody
that
dared
to
coax
him
not
even
miss
julia
of
course
it
worth
while
to
go
to
the
neighbors
major
de
jarnette
owned
us
and
he
had
a
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
to
sell
us
together
or
separate
the
neighbors
could
go
the
law
to
save
the
partin
of
mother
and
child
but
margaret
ef
i
been
a
white
woman
i
would
have
taken
that
child
and
margaret
looked
at
her
with
startled
eyes
but
the
old
woman
went
on
when
i
set
down
there
i
says
to
myself
will
have
my
child
there
ai
nobody
can
take
her
away
from
me
but
when
i
think
of
one
way
to
save
her
it
seemed
lak
there
was
a
stone
wall
set
right
down
in
front
of
me
then
when
i
turn
another
way
there
was
that
same
stone
wall
and
i
could
do
anything
but
beat
my
head
it
i
thought
and
thought
and
thought
tell
the
fire
went
out
and
cass
had
gone
to
sleep
on
the
flo
and
at
last
i
jes
says
out
loud
ai
no
use
i
got
it
to
stand
there
ai
nobody
can
help
me
honey
it
seemed
lak
i
could
git
my
breath
i
got
up
and
went
to
the
do
and
looked
out
the
stars
was
shinin
kinder
happy
like
and
when
i
looked
up
at
the
house
i
could
see
the
lights
all
glimmerin
and
hear
the
tinkle
of
miss
julia
piano
it
seemed
lak
they
wa
no
in
the
world
right
here
in
this
little
cabin
made
the
difference
i
said
shakin
my
fist
at
the
stars
and
the
lights
did
the
lord
mean
by
givin
me
a
white
woman
heart
and
then
givin
a
white
man
power
to
sell
my
child
away
from
me
he
did
know
he
did
keer
honey
the
lord
seemed
a
long
way
off
then
seem
lak
he
was
where
there
was
light
and
music
and
frien
too
and
did
know
my
heart
was
breakin
how
could
he
know
jes
then
some
words
come
into
my
mind
jes
lak
somebody
had
spoke
to
me
i
had
heared
down
in
old
figinny
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
son
to
die
i
could
remember
the
rest
but
i
jes
hung
on
to
that
much
and
said

over
and
over

but
i
set
down
in
the
chimly
corner
and

on

and
then

i
put

git
through
the
first
few
nights
then
i
laid
out

and
darned
her
stockin
and
blacked

and
when

another
thing
i

do
i
laid

and
tuk
her
in
my
arms
like
i
useter
when

blessed
night

las
time

little
head
on
this
old
breas
where

many
times
and
give
her
one
las
kiss
and
then
i
opened
the
do
ready
i
says
puttin
her
outside
and
then
i
shet
the
do
i
heared
the
overseer
it
was
him
that
had
come
with
the
man
say
she
do
seem
to
take
on
much
and
the
he
says
they
do
have
no
feelin
for
their
she
stopped
apparently
the
story
was
at
an
end
oh
mammy
cely
cried
margaret
wringing
her
hands
do
tell
me
you
never
saw
her
any
more
miss
margaret
i
never
laid
eyes
on
her
from
that
day
to
this
i
know
where
they
took
her
or
what
they
did
with
her
any
more
than
ef
the
ground
had
opened
and
swallowed
her
up
oh
i
am
glad
that
never
can
be
done
again
cried
margaret
vehemently
it
was
a
wicked
thing
to
put
so
much
power
in
any
hands
she
looked
down
at
her
own
sleeping
child
with
a
sudden
sinking
of
the
heart
and
then
into
the
impassive
face
of
the
black
woman
oh
mammy
cely
i
think
god
has
forgotten
us
honey
do
say
that
he
do
forget
then
modifying
this
statement
but
it
certainly
do
look
lak
his
remembry
is
a
heap
better
for
men
than
what
it
is
for
women
chapter
xv
instinct
triumphs
mammy
cely
story
made
a
deep
impression
on
margaret
in
her
excited
state
of
mind
she
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
it
if
the
whole
gamut
of
human
experiences
had
been
run
nothing
would
have
appealed
to
her
like
this
the
iniquity
of
the
thing
struck
her
with
a
force
that
was
almost
staggering
she
had
come
of
generations
of
who
had
never
known
anything
else
than
to
accept
conditions
as
they
found
them
and
do
for
their
dependent
ones
the
best
they
could
that
such
tragedies
as
this
had
ever
taken
place
among
them
had
never
occurred
to
her
personally
of
course
she
had
seen
nothing
of
slavery
but
she
had
spent
her
life
in
the
midst
of
the
negroes
of
washington
who
seemed
so
irresponsible
so
given
to
carousings
so
prone
to
appear
in
the
police
courts
that
she
had
never
thought
of
them
as
possessing
the
deeper
feelings
of
human
nature
they
seemed
a
people
apart
the
sad
little
story
to
which
she
had
listened
revealed
the
truth
god
had
made
all
women
hearts
alike
and
had
designated
the
color
of
their
skins
had
placed
them
in
stations
high
or
low
had
made
them
bond
or
free
and
when
he
made
them
mothers
he
touched
them
all
with
a
coal
from
the
same
altar
but
it
was
not
alone
the
pathos
of
the
story
deep
and
tragic
as
that
was
that
kept
her
night
after
night
with
eyes
staring
into
the
darkness
a
formless
terror
was
creeping
over
her
as
she
thought
of
the
author
of
the
black
woman
miseries
and
his
relationship
to
her
child
it
seemed
almost
as
if
philip
were
in
the
path
of
some
onrushing
tide
of
evil
propensities
inheritable
vices
that
might
sweep
him
away
from
her
into
an
abyss
from
which
she
could
never
rescue
him
of
course
the
wolf
blood
of
the
de
jarnettes
was
a
thing
to
smile
at
that
was
negro
superstition
but
the
sinister
fact
remained
that
the
man
who
had
sold
mammy
cely
child
was
the
father
of
the
one
who
was
trying
to
get
her
child
if
the
father
had
been
thus
cruel
what
could
be
expected
of
the
son
he
had
reared
and
to
whom
he
had
given
his
blood
with
the
curse
upon
it
there
seemed
something
awful
to
her
in
the
thought
of
that
curse
where
had
it
come
from
from
generations
of
dumb
suffering
mothers
who
could
do
nothing
but
call
down
maledictions
was
there
really
such
a
thing
as
invoking
a
curse
that
could
be
visited
from
father
to
son
she
sat
up
in
bed
to
get
her
breath
it
did
seem
as
if
she
would
suffocate
in
this
darkness
she
got
up
and
felt
for
the
matches
reaching
frantically
for
them
her
hands
shaking
her
teeth
chattering
as
the
gas
flared
up
she
felt
the
relief
that
comes
from
the
chasing
away
of
shadows
and
smiled
a
little
at
her
own
folly
she
turned
the
gas
low
what
was
that
noise
it
sounded
like
someone
at
the
front
door
judge
kirtley
had
said
they
would
never
try
to
take
philip
by
force
but
that
certainly
was
somebody
on
the
stairs
she
listened
with
every
nerve
tense
not
a
sound
but
the
stentorious
breathing
of
mammy
cely
in
the
room
beyond
she
had
slept
there
ever
since
the
baby
came
margaret
fell
back
on
the
pillow
with
relaxed
nerves
if
only
the
throbbing
in
her
head
would
stop
she
tossed
from
side
to
side
with
a
great
physical
longing
for
the
sleep
that
would
not
come
the
weeks
that
followed
were
hard
ones
for
margaret
she
was
worn
to
a
shadow
by
her
anxieties
and
the
law
delay
at
the
proper
time
judge
kirtley
had
gone
before
the
court
and
given
notice
that
de
jarnette
would
contest
the
will
on
the
ground
that
the
testator
was
of
unsound
mind
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
narrative
to
give
the
proceedings
of
that
trial
before
the
probate
court
it
is
only
the
result
that
concerns
us
it
may
be
said
in
passing
however
that
in
no
particular
did
de
jarnette
deviate
from
the
policy
he
had
adopted
at
the
first
of
simply
falling
back
upon
the
law
and
the
right
of
the
testator
to
make
such
a
will
bull
dog
tactics
judge
kirtley
called
them
to
a
brother
lawyer
not
a
word
as
to
the
unfitness
of
the
mother
to
rear
the
child
not
a
breath
affecting
her
character
the
burden
of
proof
was
with
the
contestants
and
the
contestants
unfortunately
were
short
of
proof
judge
kirtley
himself
did
not
believe
victor
de
jarnette
to
have
been
of
unsound
mind
jarvis
testified
with
great
reluctance
that
while
victor
de
jarnette
was
at
the
time
when
the
codicil
was
added
in
a
state
of
considerable
excitement
and
strong
feeling
he
saw
nothing
about
him
which
would
lead
him
jarvis
to
consider
him
of
unsound
mind
the
testimony
of
the
two
witnesses
to
the
will
was
to
the
same
effect
men
who
had
had
business
dealings
with
him
a
day
a
week
a
month
previously
were
called
to
the
and
with
one
voice
upheld
his
sanity
more
than
one
of
them
cast
a
pitying
glance
at
the
girlish
figure
back
of
judge
kirtley
and
gave
this
testimony
only
because
he
was
under
oath
servants
from
his
own
household
were
examined
as
to
whether
they
had
observed
anything
suspicious
in
their
employer
manner
or
actions
anything
that
would
incline
them
to
the
belief
that
he
was
of
unsound
mind
not
one
circumstance
pointing
toward
it
was
developed
to
all
this
counsel
for
the
contestant
could
only
offer
the
testimony
of
de
jarnette
as
to
his
state
of
passion
on
that
evening
the
unexplained
mystery
of
his
disappearance
just
before
the
birth
of
his
child
his
sensational
return
unannounced
and
his
tragic
death
this
he
said
had
been
attributed
to
accident
but
it
had
been
by
no
means
proved
that
it
was
not
by
intention
if
it
were
a
case
of
suicide
this
would
be
contributory
proof
at
least
that
he
was
not
himself
six
or
eight
months
after
the
time
of
the
making
of
the
will
the
case
of
his
mother
was
referred
to
briefly
judge
kirtley
giving
it
as
his
belief
that
no
woman
who
deserted
her
child
was
ever
in
her
right
mind
at
the
time
of
doing
it
as
judge
kirtley
spoke
of
the
possibility
of
her
husband
death
being
by
his
own
hand
margaret
involuntarily
raised
her
eyes
to
the
face
of
de
jarnette
she
was
startled
to
find
his
black
eyes
furtively
watching
her
as
on
that
day
in
her
own
library
a
hot
flush
swept
into
her
face
and
then
out
again
leaving
it
whiter
than
before
judge
kirtley
in
his
endeavors
to
keep
up
margaret
courage
had
dwelt
so
strongly
upon
the
improbability
of
the
child
being
awarded
to
de
jarnette
that
he
had
at
last
inspired
her
with
a
belief
that
the
right
would
win
as
the
case
proceeded
she
found
her
confidence
waning
but
she
was
totally
unprepared
for
the
decision
the
court
sustained
the
will
there
was
overwhelming
proof
that
the
testator
was
of
sound
mind
at
the
time
of
executing
the
will
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
looking
toward
undue
influence
and
no
charge
made
that
the
testamentary
guardian
was
an
improper
person
to
have
the
guardianship
of
the
child
the
law
while
an
ancient
one
was
explicit
as
to
the
right
of
a
husband
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
make
such
a
disposition
of
his
child
it
had
been
argued
that
it
was
a
cruel
and
unjust
law
but
it
might
be
said
in
reply
to
this
that
the
surest
way
to
the
repeal
of
a
bad
law
was
to
have
it
rigidly
enforced
therefore
etc
he
get
him
the
agonized
whisper
broke
the
stillness
that
fell
upon
the
as
the
decision
was
announced
they
took
her
home
more
dead
than
alive
it
is
a
foregone
conclusion
that
he
will
get
him
yet
my
child
judge
kirtley
told
her
as
he
helped
her
into
the
house
this
is
but
the
beginning
you
are
not
going
to
give
up
at
the
very
outset
are
you
keep
up
your
courage
margaret
you
think
you
do
care
to
have
kirtley
with
you
well
i
send
the
doctor
in
to
give
you
something
for
your
nerves
you
are
all
unstrung
there
there
here
auntie
as
mammy
cely
appeared
take
her
and
put
her
to
bed
this
has
been
hard
on
her
when
the
old
woman
followed
him
to
the
door
he
said
no
it
went
against
her
i
am
afraid
i
buoyed
her
up
a
little
too
much
this
is
the
reaction
look
after
her
in
her
darkened
room
margaret
lay
on
the
couch
and
tried
to
think
it
out
but
her
head
buzzed
so
and
she
was
so
frightfully
confused
after
a
while
maybe
she
could
but
not
now
not
now
when
she
went
to
bed
she
fell
into
fitful
sleep
her
dreams
were
worse
than
her
waking
fears
she
put
out
her
hand
every
now
and
then
to
touch
philip
and
be
sure
he
was
actually
there
as
she
tossed
thus
on
a
sleepless
bed
now
burning
with
fever
now
shaking
as
with
an
ague
mammy
cely
words
suddenly
recurred
to
her
with
startling
distinctness
if
i
had
been
a
white
woman
i
would
have
taken
that
child
and
gone
well
was
a
white
woman
she
lay
very
still
then
but
where
could
she
go
in
all
the
world
where
could
she
go
a
curious
thing
is
the
human
brain
it
has
its
crannies
and
where
it
lays
away
its
stores
as
a
housewife
piles
up
unused
linen
then
these
treasures
are
covered
up
by
other
and
later
accumulations
and
we
straightway
forget
that
they
exist
until
some
day
memory
without
ado
deftly
extricates
from
underneath
the
load
a
name
a
fact
a
story
and
holds
it
up
before
us
or
opening
but
a
crack
she
bids
us
listen
at
the
door
and
we
hear
perhaps
as
margaret
was
hearing
now
a
forgotten
voice
saying
an
obscure
spot
my
dear
you
can
hardly
find
it
on
the
map
but
if
you
ever
need
a
friend
come
to
me
her
trembling
ceased
her
heart
was
almost
brought
to
a
stop
by
the
sudden
force
of
a
hope
that
flung
itself
across
her
way
for
steadying
the
nerves
of
an
essentially
strong
person
suffering
temporary
collapse
there
is
nothing
like
an
emergency
requiring
action
it
is
the
helplessness
of
enforced
inactivity
that
saps
courage
and
bears
us
down
as
margaret
lay
there
holding
with
a
to
her
hope
she
felt
herself
thrilled
as
by
an
electric
current
strength
and
courage
came
flowing
back
to
the
heart
that
a
moment
before
had
been
at
she
thought
rapidly
then
she
got
up
and
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
not
quite
twelve
she
had
thought
it
was
nearly
morning
mammy
cely
was
in
her
usual
deep
sleep
but
margaret
took
the
precaution
to
close
her
door
with
swift
noiseless
steps
she
dressed
herself
and
taking
a
handbag
filled
it
with
baby
garments
she
stuffed
a
pocket
book
well
down
into
the
bag
having
first
taken
from
it
a
roll
of
bills
and
secreted
them
about
her
person
a
superstitious
thrill
passed
through
her
at
sight
of
the
money
it
was
much
more
than
she
was
in
the
habit
of
drawing
and
it
had
been
taken
from
the
bank
only
yesterday
the
teller
had
said
to
her
as
he
handed
it
to
her
de
jarnette
that
is
a
large
sum
to
have
in
the
house
i
should
not
let
the
amount
be
known
to
the
servants
or
to
anybody
what
had
prompted
her
to
draw
so
much
money
surely
it
was
god
leading
he
meant
her
to
escape
she
went
next
to
a
drawer
and
took
out
her
jewels
mostly
gifts
from
her
father
with
a
few
simple
things
that
were
her
mother
there
was
a
diamond
brooch
and
earrings
and
necklace
that
had
been
mother
she
had
forgotten
them
in
her
guilty
flight
and
they
had
come
to
margaret
she
put
them
back
into
the
drawer
and
with
them
some
gifts
of
victor
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
just
then
to
take
marking
the
box
plainly
the
de
jarnette
diamonds
and
locking
them
up
this
done
she
sat
down
with
the
clock
before
her
and
wrote
two
notes
one
a
very
brief
one
to
richard
de
jarnette
it
said
i
leave
you
the
de
jarnette
diamonds
i
would
willingly
give
up
the
de
jarnette
money
if
you
will
relinquish
your
claim
to
philip
but
i
shall
let
you
have
my
child
it
was
in
different
vein
that
she
wrote
to
judge
kirtley
he
must
forgive
her
for
going
she
could
help
it
she
simply
had
to
go
the
appeal
might
fail
as
this
had
the
world
was
so
large
she
was
sure
that
she
could
find
some
place
in
it
where
she
could
hide
away
and
be
at
peace
she
had
not
told
him
because
she
thought
it
might
be
better
for
a
while
for
him
not
to
know
then
too
she
had
felt
sure
that
he
would
try
to
dissuade
her
and
she
go
he
would
forgive
her
she
knew
he
had
been
a
father
to
her
here
the
page
was
blurred
and
the
letter
ended
abruptly
sealing
and
directing
both
she
placed
them
on
the
mantel
in
plain
sight
the
car
line
runs
past
dupont
circle
and
the
house
on
massachusetts
avenue
was
not
far
off
she
would
be
in
time
for
the
owl
car
which
would
take
her
to
the
and
station
she
would
not
risk
calling
a
carriage
when
she
finished
the
letters
margaret
took
up
her
bag
and
went
softly
down
the
great
stairway
a
dim
light
was
burning
in
the
hall
and
by
it
she
made
her
way
to
the
door
unlocking
it
and
drawing
back
the
heavy
bolts
there
was
no
sign
of
tremor
in
her
hand
no
fear
in
her
face
only
a
fierce
eagerness
to
be
gone
putting
the
bag
on
the
outside
and
leaving
the
door
ajar
that
there
might
be
no
delay
she
crept
noiselessly
up
the
stairs
again
the
old
woman
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
slept
heavily
recking
little
of
the
train
of
consequences
her
story
had
started
she
might
not
have
withheld
it
had
she
known
the
striking
of
the
clock
admonished
margaret
that
she
had
no
time
to
lose
she
caught
up
the
baby
bonneted
and
cloaked
against
the
cold
hushed
it
with
soft
whisperings
and
stole
down
the
stairs
she
did
not
stop
to
look
around
perhaps
she
did
not
dare
she
had
come
to
the
house
a
bride
she
was
leaving
it
a
fugitive
the
door
creaked
as
it
swung
back
on
its
massive
hinges
the
sound
startled
her
outside
the
street
was
silent
and
empty
the
city
was
sleeping
its
beauty
sleep
she
closed
the
door
softly
pressed
her
baby
close
to
her
breast
and
slipped
out
into
the
darkness
chapter
xvi
in
the
north
countree
richard
de
jarnette
was
sitting
down
to
a
late
breakfast
the
next
morning
when
his
telephone
bell
rang
he
answered
it
impatiently
as
was
natural
but
what
he
heard
there
caused
him
to
leave
his
hot
waffles
untouched
and
go
hurrying
over
to
the
house
on
massachusetts
avenue
at
margaret
door
he
met
judge
kirtley
brought
thither
by
a
similar
message
and
together
they
entered
the
house
it
was
evident
to
de
jarnette
that
judge
kirtley
surprise
was
as
unfeigned
as
his
own
the
servants
were
gathered
in
the
lower
hall
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
with
nobody
in
command
johnson
the
man
servant
related
how
he
had
found
the
front
door
unlocked
and
fearing
burglary
had
gone
straight
to
de
jarnette
room
and
knocked
and
knocked
without
rousing
anybody
then
mammy
cely
took
up
the
tale
telling
of
how
she
had
heard
johnson
knock
and
made
sure
she
had
overslept
of
how
she
had
gone
into
miss
margaret
room
and
found
it
in
confusion
and
nobody
there
there
were
two
letters
that
de
jarnette
cut
her
short
by
demanding
to
see
the
room
and
the
letters
they
found
every
evidence
of
a
hasty
flight
drawers
had
been
left
open
with
their
contents
tumbled
about
clothes
were
lying
on
the
floor
and
the
disordered
bed
showed
that
she
had
risen
from
it
to
go
the
two
men
read
their
letters
hastily
but
with
widely
different
emotions
de
jarnette
took
the
key
enclosed
with
his
and
opened
the
drawer
the
diamonds
were
there
as
she
had
said
he
locked
the
drawer
and
handed
the
key
to
judge
kirtley
as
her
legal
adviser
you
will
of
course
take
charge
of
the
place
these
things
should
be
put
in
safe
keeping
then
with
a
change
of
tone
that
was
not
pleasant
i
suppose
it
is
hardly
worth
while
to
enquire
of
you
where
she
has
gone
i
know
no
more
sir
about
where
she
has
gone
than
you
do
the
judge
answered
indignantly
you
can
see
for
yourself
handing
him
margaret
letter
then
he
added
sternly
his
face
working
with
emotion
i
only
know
that
she
has
become
a
homeless
fugitive
richard
de
jarnette
read
the
letter
but
his
face
did
not
soften
when
he
went
from
the
house
a
few
moments
later
it
was
to
call
a
cab
and
go
straight
to
the
detective
bureau
mammy
cely
stood
looking
after
him
as
he
went
away
i
wonder
ef
what
i
said
about
a
white
woman
chance
to
git
off
could
a
put
that
notion
in
miss
margaret
head
she
thought
with
some
perturbation
then
defiantly
well
i
do
keer
ef
it
did
she
got
a
heap
mo
right
to
that
chile
than
marse
richard
has
she
done
put
a
right
smart
of
herself
in
him
an
marse
richard
ai
nothin
but
his
gyarjeen
while
the
enginery
for
tracking
her
was
thus
being
set
in
motion
in
washington
margaret
with
her
child
in
her
arms
was
speeding
over
the
country
hundreds
of
miles
away
her
face
set
toward
the
west
every
mile
gave
her
an
added
sense
of
security
she
was
confident
that
richard
knew
nothing
of
pennybacker
existence
even
and
was
sure
too
that
she
had
been
able
to
get
away
without
leaving
a
clue
behind
her
at
the
station
it
had
been
by
a
happy
chance
was
it
chance
that
she
had
been
able
to
cover
her
tracks
there
she
had
gone
directly
to
the
lower
hoping
that
she
might
find
some
way
to
get
her
ticket
without
presenting
herself
before
the
ticket
agent
as
she
sat
pondering
this
a
negro
woman
came
in
and
sat
down
beside
her
a
sudden
thought
struck
margaret
are
you
going
on
this
next
train
she
asked
yes
the
woman
said
she
had
been
down
in
virginia
and
was
going
home
no
she
did
live
in
washington
she
lived
in
maryland
she
had
been
gone
ten
days
had
a
ticket
margaret
took
out
some
bills
would
you
mind
getting
my
ticket
for
me
to
cincinnati

ca

she
held
out
a
silver
dollar
and
the
woman
rose
with
alacrity
it
was
not
often
she
could
earn
a
dollar
as
easily
as
that
and
so
it
came
about
that
when
the
detective
in
de
jarnette
employ
questioned
the
agent
about
tickets
sold
the
night
before
that
official
could
remember
nothing
bearing
upon
the
case
no
woman
with
a
baby
had
presented
herself
at
the
window
that
evening
he
felt
quite
sure
margaret
had
decided
that
it
would
be
safer
to
get
a
ticket
to
cincinnati
another
to
louis
and
still
another
to
callaway
than
to
risk
a
through
ticket
to
her
destination
it
was
a
lucky
star
that
guided
margaret
de
jarnette
to
missouri
where
are
warm
hearts
and
hospitable
homes
she
found
there
the
two
things
that
she
was
in
desperate
need
of
a
refuge
and
a
friend
pennybacker
lived
on
a
farm
with
her
orphaned
granddaughter
bess
who
was
at
that
time
at
synodical
college
in
fulton
she
welcomed
margaret
with
all
the
warmth
of
a
great
heart
and
the
accumulated
love
of
two
generations
and
here
for
four
years
and
a
half
the
mother
and
child
found
a
shelter
from
the
storm
a
covert
so
secure
that
richard
de
jarnette
with
all
his
efforts
had
never
been
able
to
ferret
it
out
margaret
had
taken
every
precaution
to
lose
her
identity
the
name
of
de
jarnette
was
of
course
discarded
and
she
would
not
even
risk
varnum
she
was
known
in
the
neighborhood
as
osborne
a
friend
of
pennybacker
from
the
east
who
had
recently
been
bereaved
and
had
come
to
her
for
a
quiet
home
it
was
not
an
inquisitive
locality
and
a
word
from
pennybacker
as
to
the
depth
of
the
widowed
lady
grief
and
her
reluctance
to
have
it
referred
to
effectually
sealed
the
lips
of
the
kindly
folk
among
whom
her
lot
was
cast
bess
when
she
came
home
for
the
vacation
was
told
as
much
as
her
grandmother
thought
best
to
tell
and
no
more
we
take
her
in
on
probation
and
after
a
while
when
she
has
been
proved
into
full
communion
i
am
that
much
of
a
methodist
anyway
pennybacker
said
it
is
needless
to
say
that
long
before
this
bess
was
a
sister
in
full
fellowship
margaret
was
not
even
willing
to
let
her
safety
rest
upon
a
change
of
name
in
her
first
wild
fear
that
she
might
be
tracked
she
had
wanted
it
given
out
in
the
neighborhood
that
the
child
was
a
girl
but
upon
this
pennybacker
set
her
foot
down
hard
it
was
a
comparatively
easy
thing
she
admitted
to
change
the
sex
of
a
baby
and
it
did
seem
under
the
circumstances
that
it
would
be
a
most
innocent
and
inoffensive
lie
but
it
was
the
nature
of
some
lies
that
having
been
once
entered
into
they
must
be
persevered
in
to
the
bitter
end
margaret
would
find
that
having
become
entangled
in
this
one
the
sex
complications
would
grow
in
intricacy
as
the
years
went
by
so
that
was
given
up
the
girl
had
written
to
judge
kirtley
a
few
weeks
after
reaching
missouri
telling
him
of
her
new
home
and
her
plans
and
thereafter
pennybacker
received
new
york
drafts
at
regular
intervals
he
had
also
written
margaret
at
once
informing
her
of
de
jarnette
movements
so
far
as
they
could
be
ascertained
he
is
very
he
wrote
but
determined
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
keeping
up
a
still
hunt
all
the
time
by
the
way
of
course
you
must
know
that
you
have
laid
yourself
liable
to
action
against
you
on
a
charge
of
kidnapping
i
am
hoping
that
de
jarnette
feeling
against
you
may
wear
itself
out
in
time
but
in
the
meantime
take
every
precaution
margaret
was
wild
with
fear
after
this
and
kept
the
old
farmhouse
locked
night
and
day
philip
was
never
out
of
her
sight
but
as
months
and
finally
years
went
by
and
she
heard
nothing
more
it
seemed
that
richard
de
jarnette
must
have
given
up
the
search
when
philip
was
nearly
three
her
vigilance
relaxed
enough
to
permit
her
to
go
to
california
for
the
winter
with
pennybacker
bess
being
still
at
synodical
for
this
trip
margaret
had
insisted
upon
dressing
philip
in
girl
attire
it
was
done
half
in
jest
but
it
succeeded
admirably
for
a
child
of
three
is
too
young
to
object
to
such
a
metamorphosis
and
it
gave
margaret
great
comfort
she
felt
sure
that
de
jarnette
and
son
would
never
be
recognized
under
the
hotel
alias
of
osborne
and
daughter
so
successful
had
this
trip
been
that
pennybacker
urged
her
going
to
the
world
fair
the
next
summer
but
there
was
too
much
risk
there
margaret
decided
where
all
the
world
might
be
found
and
now
this
summer
some
four
years
since
her
midnight
flight
from
home
judge
kirtley
had
written
her
that
de
jarnette
counsel
had
told
him
privately
he
was
sure
that
de
jarnette
had
abandoned
all
hope
of
ever
finding
his
ward
and
had
given
up
the
search
she
grew
so
jubilant
and
buoyant
in
spirits
after
this
that
the
natural
instincts
of
a
young
woman
asserted
themselves
and
when
pennybacker
proposed
a
summer
at
mackinac
she
made
no
opposition
it
is
hardly
natural
for
a
girl
to
enjoy
for
its
own
sake
isolation
on
a
quiet
farm
she
and
bess
took
up
the
work
of
planning
for
mackinac
with
great
zest
but
there
was
one
thing
if
they
went
philip
must
go
as
a
girl
that
had
given
her
such
a
sense
of
security
on
the
california
trip
pennybacker
disapproved
strongly
i
tell
you
it
is
safe
it
may
get
you
into
no
end
of
trouble
i
shall
not
go
unless
we
can
go
that
way
margaret
finally
announced
and
that
settled
it
philip
was
told
that
his
going
depended
upon
his
keeping
the
secret
and
of
course
promised
implicit
obedience
but
philip
did
not
then
know
the
obloquy
which
attached
to
being
a
girl
nor
the
depth
of
humiliation
into
which
it
would
plunge
him
his
long
curls
which
had
never
been
cut
off
and
his
nickname
trottie
fortunately
a
sexless
one
aided
greatly
in
the
success
of
the
scheme
margaret
generally
called
him
dearest
anyway
and
pennybacker
baby
which
he
resented
on
the
lake
steamer
they
had
fallen
in
with
a
harcourt
a
young
man
from
the
east
whose
home
had
once
been
in
michigan
and
who
after
an
illness
had
been
remanded
by
his
physician
to
that
invigorating
region
of
balsams
and
cedars
for
a
rest
he
had
made
himself
useful
to
pennybacker
in
the
matter
of
baggage
just
as
they
were
starting
and
he
came
around
after
they
were
well
out
on
the
lake
courteously
solicitous
of
her
comfort
he
was
introduced
to
the
girls
and
took
some
pains
to
interest
the
child
who
showed
an
instant
liking
to
him
he
did
not
intrude
himself
upon
them
but
came
back
up
from
time
to
time
to
point
out
a
boat
in
sight
or
to
show
philip
the
gulls
which
at
dinner
time
followed
fast
and
furious
in
their
wake
finally
with
de
jarnette
permission
he
took
the
child
off
to
investigate
the
boat
saying
enthusiastically
when
he
returned
after
an
hour
i
never
saw
a
girl
show
so
much
interest
in
everything
why
she
was
as
intent
upon
finding
out
what
made
the
engine
go
as
a
boy
would
have
been
yes
i
understand
children
i
have
nephews
and
nieces
margaret
had
taken
philip
aside
after
this
and
held
an
earnest
conversation
with
him
at
the
end
of
which
the
child
nodded
several
times
not
very
joyously
which
all
goes
to
show
the
benumbing
influence
upon
the
human
mind
of
feminine
attire
and
exactly
how
it
works
a
friendship
begun
on
shipboard
culminates
rapidly
especially
when
it
is
under
the
fostering
influence
of
a
child
and
a
sensible
elderly
lady
who
is
sure
she
can
not
be
deceived
in
men
by
the
time
these
travelers
reached
their
desired
haven
they
seemed
like
old
friends
it
was
undeniable
that
harcourt
had
contributed
more
than
his
share
to
the
pleasure
of
the
trip
pennybacker
for
one
began
to
think
with
regret
of
the
time
when
he
would
leave
them
a
thing
that
harcourt
had
by
this
time
no
intention
of
doing
well
we
are
almost
there
now
he
said
coming
upon
them
as
they
stood
in
the
bow
watching
the
island
grow
in
distinctness
of
detail
did
you
ever
see
anything
finer
than
that
and
certainly
for
beauty
of
approach
the
island
of
mackinac
is
without
a
rival
have
you
decided
on
your
hotel
yet
mrs
pennybacker
he
asked
a
moment
later
yes
we
looked
it
up
a
little
and
think
we
shall
go
to
the
island
house
they
say
that
is
near
where
anne
lived
and
we
thought
we
would
like
that
how
fortunate
i
am
he
exclaimed
with
instant
choice
that
where
i
going
myself
bess
looked
away
toward
round
island
with
slightly
heightened
color
it
was
in
this
very
natural
way
that
he
attached
himself
to
their
party
it
proved
pleasant
for
them
all
with
the
child
he
was
prime
favorite
he
asked
bess
one
day
what
her
real
name
was
and
bess
forgetting
that
philippa
had
been
the
name
agreed
upon
in
case
the
question
were
ever
asked
and
remembering
varnum
had
answered
with
some
confusion
that
she
was
named
after
her
mother
well
naturally
he
had
laughed
i
suppose
you
mean
her
mother
in
the
raillery
that
ensued
bess
escaped
and
he
always
supposed
the
child
name
was
margaret
he
had
never
told
them
where
he
was
from
beyond
the
fact
that
he
was
a
michigan
man
until
their
intimacy
was
well
established
an
accidental
omission
evidently
since
he
had
told
them
almost
everything
else
in
his
frank
boyish
way
it
was
therefore
with
the
utmost
astonishment
that
margaret
one
day
heard
him
speak
of
washington
as
his
place
of
residence
washington
she
exclaimed
i
thought
michigan
was
your
home
it
was
formerly
but
for
several
years
i
have
lived
in
washington
how
many
years
she
asked
with
the
air
of
an
inquisitor
four
this
month
then
raising
his
right
hand
i
would
further
state
if
it
please
the
court
that
i
am
a
member
of
that
large
and
respectable
body
which
pours
out
of
the
departmental
halls
promptly
at
four
you
mean
you
are
a
clerk
in
one
of
the
departments
asked
pennybacker
margaret
was
thinking
well
i
glad
he
is
a
lawyer
or
a
business
man
that
is
my
humble
occupation
madam
i
hope
i
have
led
you
to
suppose
that
i
am
a
cabinet
officer
or
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
in
disguise
you
have
misled
me
into
thinking
you
other
than
you
are
pennybacker
replied
composedly
and
that
is
a
rollicking
boy
after
this
talk
margaret
was
most
circumspect
in
her
references
to
washington
it
seemed
as
if
harcourt
would
be
trustworthy
but
she
told
pennybacker
that
night
i
do
trust
anybody
the
four
were
sitting
on
the
piazza
of
the
island
house
one
day
late
in
the
summer
looking
out
over
the
straits
a
steamer
from
chicago
was
rounding
the
buoy
preparatory
to
making
the
harbor
and
they
were
watching
it
opposite
them
round
island
rose
from
the
waters
like
an
emerald
set
in
translucent
pearl
and
across
the
straits
to
the
south
and
miles
away
could
be
discerned
the
outline
of
the
mainland
a
dark
diagonal
smoke
line
across
the
sky
defined
the
path
of
the
patient
little
ferry
which
kept
up
communication
with
the
outer
world
and
the
fraying
out
of
the
line
at
the
further
end
into
an
indeterminate
bank
of
cloud
showed
which
way
it
was
going
far
off
to
the
left
where
the
waters
of
lake
michigan
merge
into
those
of
huron
was
another
faint
blur
on
the
horizon
to
the
initiated
versed
in
signs
and
seasons
it
stood
for
the
steamer
from
detroit
carriages
were
driving
swiftly
to
the
docks
to
meet
the
incoming
boat
for
mackinac
short
season
was
nearing
its
end
and
it
behooved
the
emptying
caravanseries
to
be
making
all
the
hay
they
could
the
group
on
the
piazza
watched
the
hacks
with
interest
two
of
them
laying
mild
wagers
on
the
results
i
bet
on
the
island
house
said
john
harcourt
the
caramels
against
a
cigar
i
to
select
it
come
now
and
i
on
the
mission
house
cried
bess
and
please
understand
that
i
am
to
specify
the
amount
of
caramels
we
watch
and
see
when
they
come
back
now
do
forget
to
look
in
the
meantime
suggested
pennybacker
let
talk
about
that
inland
trip
that
harcourt
has
been
expatiating
on
i
think
i
should
like
to
go
down
to
for
a
few
days
and
we
may
as
well
go
that
way
what
do
you
say
margaret
margaret
de
jarnette
who
had
been
leaning
over
the
railing
watching
the
child
at
play
on
the
lawn
below
looked
up
she
was
older
but
her
face
had
not
lost
its
beautiful
contour
and
she
had
the
same
queenly
way
of
lifting
her
head
upon
which
lay
great
masses
of
golden
brown
hair
the
glint
on
it
where
it
was
touched
by
the
sun
hinted
that
it
might
once
have
been
like
the
burnished
gold
of
the
child
long
curls
her
eyes
matched
her
hair
i
should
like
to
go
with
all
its
breaks
and
musical
repetitions
has
an
attractive
sound
it
seems
as
if
we
might
be
likely
to
drop
into
a
community
of
wigwams
there
that
would
be
strange
said
the
young
man
for
here
we
are
very
close
to
land
of
the
ojibways
to
the
land
of
osborne
harcourt
broke
in
suddenly
that
girl
of
yours
throws
exactly
like
a
boy
look
at
her
now
well
this
is
settling
the
question
said
pennybacker
hastily
harcourt
tell
us
some
of
the
points
of
this
inland
trip
john
harcourt
was
doing
this
very
enthusiastically
when
bess
catching
sight
of
the
returning
vehicles
cried
out
wait
a
minute
there
come
the
carriages
now
let
watch
all
right
first
carriage
mission
house
empty
please
note
half
a
dollar
if
you
please
i
never
smoke
less
than
fifty
cent
cigars
on
a
wager
well
you
can
just
get
me
a
pound
of
caramels
any
way
pouted
the
girl
for
the
island
house
has
just
one
lone
man
oh
come
that
a
hundred
per
cent
more
than
your
house
has
the
one
lone
man
was
the
object
of
their
most
interested
scrutiny
as
the
carriage
drew
up
from
their
seats
they
could
see
without
themselves
being
observed
why
y
said
harcourt
in
surprise
is
that
queer
i
seen
that
man
in
washington
who
is
he
asked
pennybacker
abruptly
his
name
is
smeltzer
he
is
on
the
detective
force
there
or
he
was
when
i
knew
him
does
he
know
you
i
doubt
if
he
would
remember
me
still
you
ca
tell
it
is
a
part
of
a
detective
stock
in
trade
to
remember
faces
why
he
did
some
work
for
a
friend
of
mine
once
and
i
used
to
see
him
sometimes
margaret
de
jarnette
leaned
over
the
piazza
rail
and
spoke
quietly
to
the
child
playing
below
dearest
come
to
mama
now
not
yet
mama
pleaded
the
child
yes
now
she
had
been
gone
but
a
few
minutes
when
pennybacker
followed
her
to
her
room
she
found
the
door
locked
and
the
young
woman
in
the
act
of
packing
a
suit
case
what
are
you
doing
margaret
i
am
going
away
from
this
place
the
girl
exclaimed
excitedly
somewhere
i
do
know
where
you
think
this
man
is
here
after
you
i
feel
sure
of
it
would
he
know
you
i
ca
tell
you
know
the
case
was
tried
in
washington
and
the
is
just
across
the
street
from
the
detective
bureau
he
may
have
been
in
the
and
as
harcourt
says
without
doubt
they
acquire
the
habit
of
noticing
faces
no
i
wo
take
any
chances
there
is
too
much
at
stake
i
am
going
to
get
aboard
the
first
boat
that
comes
and
go
anywhere
it
takes
me
i
think
i
shall
take
the
ferry
for
mackinaw
city
but
i
may
go
back
to
ignace
if
that
boat
is
in
first
the
mackinaw
ferry
will
be
in
first
said
pennybacker
it
will
be
here
inside
of
a
half
hour
then
after
a
moment
thought
margaret
why
do
we
all
go
down
to
with
you
now
why
yes
we
can
get
ready
if
you
can
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
pack
our
grips
we
need
give
up
our
rooms
we
tell
harcourt
that
it
a
sudden
inspiration
he
can
join
us
or
not
as
he
likes
speak
to
them
at
once
when
she
did
so
harcourt
remonstrated
vigorously
having
in
mind
the
inland
trip
but
without
avail
there
was
evidently
something
in
the
wind
that
he
did
not
understand
and
when
pennybacker
told
him
plainly
that
they
would
have
to
go
whether
he
found
it
convenient
to
accompany
them
or
not
he
gave
in
a
half
hour
later
found
them
all
ensconced
on
the
deck
of
the
ferry
margaret
with
her
black
veil
drawn
down
over
her
face
she
sat
where
she
could
watch
the
gangway
and
she
saw
every
passenger
that
got
on
she
did
not
feel
easy
till
the
plank
was
in
but
the
man
was
not
there
she
was
very
sure
of
that
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
as
the
boat
pushed
off
john
harcourt
saw
nothing
but
tragedy
in
the
wreck
of
his
plans
to
think
of
that
beautiful
inland
trip
going
to
the
like
this
he
grumbled
to
bess
as
they
sat
together
in
the
hot
dusty
car
enroute
for
i
do
pretend
to
understand
why
we
did
it
i
do
believe
they
know
themselves
you
did
have
to
come
said
bess
oh
well
chapter
xvii
in
the
somewhat
frayed
and
ragged
end
of
the
mitten
to
which
the
state
of
michigan
has
been
likened
is
a
modest
bay
indenting
the
edge
called
little
traverse
to
distinguish
it
from
another
further
down
where
a
greater
rent
has
been
raveled
out
into
this
bay
a
long
slim
finger
of
land
is
thrust
out
from
the
northern
shore
enclosing
in
its
crook
a
harbor
so
safe
and
possible
in
all
seas
that
from
the
earliest
navigation
of
these
waters
it
has
been
a
port
the
port
known
in
the
days
of
new
france
by
the
more
euphonious
name
of
croche
is
now
called
prosaically
harbor
springs
but
the
bay
by
the
most
fortunate
reversion
to
an
earlier
occupation
is
signifying
in
the
indian
tongue
from
which
it
is
derived
a
little
one
within
the
larger
bay
on
this
inner
bay
has
grown
up
among
the
white
birches
a
very
beautiful
little
summer
resort
and
it
was
here
that
margaret
de
jarnette
found
herself
after
her
flight
from
the
island
she
had
had
a
calm
night
and
had
waked
with
a
song
of
deliverance
on
her
lips
here
surely
in
this
peaceful
spot
was
nothing
which
could
molest
or
make
afraid
rising
early
she
had
dressed
herself
and
philip
and
together
they
had
slipped
past
pennybacker
door
and
on
out
upon
the
hotel
piazza
the
only
sound
of
life
was
the
clatter
in
the
kitchen
and
but
her
soul
was
so
full
of
relief
that
she
had
found
it
impossible
to
sleep
as
she
looked
out
over
the
bay
sparkling
in
the
morning
sun
her
joy
bubbled
over
and
the
words
of
an
old
anthem
rose
to
her
lips
she
sang
it
softly
but
triumphantly
as
she
and
philip
went
out
upon
the
pier
my
soul
is
escaped
like
a
bird
like
a
bird
from
the
snare
of
the
fowlers
my
soul
is
escaped
my
soul
is
escaped
my
soul
is
escaped
my
soul
is
escaped
there
was
a
jubilant
ascending
scale
at
the
last
good
morning
came
a
voice
from
behind
her
your
body
came
perilously
near
escaping
too
i
am
out
of
breath
trying
to
catch
up
with
you
i
was
glad
there
was
water
beyond
so
that
something
could
stop
you
it
was
john
harcourt
every
trace
of
last
night
bad
humor
gone
oh
good
morning
is
this
superb
i
do
often
sing
but
this
air
is
like
wine
i
think
it
went
to
my
head
but
then
i
did
expect
to
have
an
audience
this
time
of
the
morning
where
are
the
others
not
up
yet
they
are
losing
the
cream
of
the
day
are
they
then
turning
toward
the
water
what
place
is
that
across
the
bay
it
looks
like
quite
a
city
petoskey
named
for
an
old
ottawa
chief
of
this
locality
i
believe
and
that
place
over
at
our
right
is
harbor
point
i
noticed
it
last
night
the
lights
from
both
places
add
immeasurably
to
the
beauty
of
the
night
scene
especially
the
one
from
the
lighthouse
it
throws
a
shaft
of
glowing
red
across
the
water
did
you
notice
it
i
thought
i
never
saw
anything
so
lovely
as
this
bay
was
by
moonlight
it
is
beautiful
in
all
its
phases
i
have
heard
it
likened
to
the
bay
of
naples
come
and
take
a
morning
walk
with
me
what
do
you
say
it
will
give
you
an
appetite
for
the
broiled
whitefish
you
will
have
for
breakfast
can
i
go
without
my
hat
certainly
nobody
wears
hats
now
but
old
ladies
and
men
she
caught
the
spirit
of
the
hour
come
dearest
let
see
if
we
outwalk
him
philip
ran
up
ahead
in
great
glee
if
you
get
tired
young
lady
i
carry
you
harcourt
called
after
him
i
can
carry
my
own
was
the
proud
answer
that
will
fix
her
said
harcourt
i
never
saw
a
youngster
so
afraid
of
being
helped
they
walked
back
to
the
broad
walk
running
along
the
bay
front
and
turned
east
the
walk
was
some
distance
back
from
the
water
here
and
lay
between
clumps
of
white
birches
left
to
their
natural
irregularity
but
growing
so
thick
that
they
formed
a
shadowy
aisle
for
them
to
walk
through
now
i
will
be
showman
this
house
pointing
to
a
yellow
frame
house
with
verandas
on
three
sides
they
say
is
one
of
the
oldest
on
the
grounds
one
of
the
pioneers
in
fact
but
it
does
look
it
it
certainly
has
an
air
of
solid
comfort
and
its
owner
must
have
had
first
choice
of
sites
see
those
birches
there
at
the
east
she
broke
off
to
say
excitedly
oh
philip
look
did
you
see
that
dear
little
squirrel
there
running
up
the
tree
john
harcourt
said
to
himself
well
that
queer
he
did
not
refer
to
it
when
they
started
on
and
she
was
plainly
unaware
that
she
had
used
the
name
but
he
laid
it
away
in
his
memory
for
future
reference
philip
bess
had
said
in
gayest
mood
they
wandered
on
down
the
bay
until
they
came
to
roaring
brook
here
taking
philip
hand
harcourt
led
the
way
under
boughs
to
a
which
took
them
straight
into
solitudes
a
board
walk
which
seemed
almost
an
impertinence
in
its
newness
a
parvenue
except
for
its
considerateness
in
walking
around
instead
of
over
the
gentry
of
the
forest
followed
the
windings
of
a
stream
dark
and
shadowy
in
its
shallows
swam
schools
of
minnows
which
they
watched
from
the
rustic
bridges
and
flecks
of
sunlight
fell
upon
it
in
patches
here
and
there
they
were
in
a
tanglewood
of
tall
timber
mammoth
cedars
that
looked
centuries
old
and
lofty
elms
and
maples
and
hemlocks
lifting
their
heads
defiantly
but
it
was
a
pitiful
defiance
after
all
for
on
every
side
lay
fallen
giants
that
had
succumbed
as
they
must
one
day
succumb
to
a
force
stronger
than
themselves
and
their
stricken
forms
their
outstretched
arms
told
of
the
vanquishment
not
even
the
mosses
and
the
friendly
vines
clambering
from
limb
to
limb
could
hide
their
shame
oh
this
is
nature
tragedy
cried
margaret
he
had
observed
in
her
a
habit
of
endowing
inanimate
objects
with
life
and
suffering
or
rejoicing
with
them
they
had
to
give
up
they
simply
had
to
give
up
to
a
power
that
was
mightier
than
they
if
they
had
only
bent
he
said
they
might
have
been
standing
yet
how
can
an
oak
bend
she
cried
even
a
tree
must
live
according
to
its
nature
and
then
when
the
storm
overpowers
it
go
down
so
must
we
all
he
stood
idly
throwing
pieces
of
bark
into
the
black
depths
of
the
stream
and
watching
them
float
off
he
was
thinking
what
an
intense
creature
she
is
when
next
she
spoke
it
was
to
repeat
the
opening
lines
of
forest
hymn
her
hands
clasped
on
her
heaving
breast
and
her
head
thrown
back
it
would
not
have
surprised
him
much
if
she
had
dropped
to
her
knees
and
begun
crossing
herself
or
have
prostrated
herself
upon
the
walk
her
forehead
in
the
dust
it
is
not
altogether
flattering
to
my
vanity
he
mused
but
i
bet
a
nickel
she
has
forgotten
that
i
am
in
the
world
she
is
up
in
the
clouds
for
some
reason
and
yet
i
could
bring
her
down
with
a
word
one
little
word
a
boyish
impulse
came
over
him
to
try
it
he
called
softly
to
the
child
who
had
run
on
up
the
walk
philip
and
yet
more
softly
philip
she
turned
toward
him
with
a
look
of
such
abject
terror
that
he
repented
the
experiment
the
color
had
simply
dropped
from
her
face
leaving
it
white
and
rigid
why
do
you
call
him
why
do
you
use
that
name
she
asked
with
dry
lips
i
heard
you
say
it
i
she
said
incredulously
when
not
a
half
hour
ago
it
sounded
to
me
as
if
you
dropped
into
it
from
habit
she
laughed
uneasily
but
her
color
was
coming
back
her
name
is
philippa
you
probably
heard
me
say
that
and
thought
i
said
philip
she
she
does
often
get
her
real
name
he
was
looking
at
her
with
a
quizzical
smile
he
knew
from
bess
or
thought
he
did
that
the
child
name
was
margaret
you
do
lie
as
if
you
were
used
to
it
he
said
coolly
try
it
again
how
dare
you
talk
to
me
like
that
she
cried
and
by
what
right
do
you
question
me
i
have
questioned
you
what
you
have
told
has
been
told
voluntarily
i
hardly
think
you
would
stick
to
it
if
i
question
you
but
i
have
no
intention
of
doing
it
then
he
came
nearer
to
her
and
spoke
very
seriously
osborne
i
beg
your
pardon
for
speaking
as
i
did
my
foolish
habit
of
flippancy
has
misled
me
into
doing
a
thing
i
had
no
right
to
do
or
rather
into
speaking
in
a
manner
that
i
had
no
right
to
use
toward
you
i
really
think
that
my
friendship
for
you
which
you
have
not
forbidden
at
any
rate
does
give
me
the
right
to
put
you
on
your
guard
i
have
not
the
remotest
idea
of
the
reason
for
the
deception
that
you
are
practising
but
surely
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
keep
it
up
his
kindly
tone
and
the
manliness
of
his
apology
completely
disarmed
her
oh
she
said
clasping
her
hands
in
distress
it
is
because
there
is
so
much
at
stake
that
i
must
keep
it
up
i
am
driven
to
it
they
were
walking
along
the
woodsy
path
now
but
neither
was
noticing
tree
or
fern
or
stream
after
all
it
is
the
human
interest
that
overpowers
every
other
i
do
not
wish
to
force
your
confidence
but
if
i
could
help
you
she
shook
her
head
you
can
not
help
me
there
is
only
one
person
in
all
the
world
that
could
help
me
and
he
she
broke
off
abruptly
saying
later
harcourt
i
i
can
not
explain
but
will
you
not
trust
me
that
it
is
all
right
you
have
not
set
me
a
good
example
in
trust
he
said
looking
down
into
her
troubled
eyes
but
certainly
there
has
been
nothing
to
shake
my
confidence
in
you
except
in
your
judgment
if
the
time
ever
comes
that
i
can
help
you
you
know
where
to
find
me
she
put
out
her
hand
and
he
held
it
for
a
moment
in
his
then
looking
at
his
watch
he
said
i
think
it
is
time
we
are
getting
back
he
whistled
to
philip
who
was
still
proudly
walking
ahead
and
when
he
came
back
took
him
by
the
hand
and
relieved
the
situation
by
devoting
himself
entirely
to
the
child
showing
him
all
manner
of
wonderful
things
that
the
woods
contained
he
did
not
speak
to
margaret
again
until
they
were
in
the
bay
path
and
then
it
was
only
to
call
her
attention
to
the
different
kinds
of
evergreens
growing
along
the
road
and
to
show
her
how
to
identify
them
over
the
broiled
whitefish
at
breakfast
they
discussed
their
walk
and
plans
for
the
day
harcourt
was
his
old
irrepressible
self
and
margaret
equilibrium
was
restored
though
he
noticed
that
her
buoyancy
of
the
early
morning
was
gone
he
could
not
help
wondering
many
times
through
the
day
what
the
trouble
was
that
so
darkened
her
life
and
who
the
one
person
was
who
could
help
her
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
two
days
later
they
all
sat
on
the
piazza
talking
intermittently
it
seemed
very
pleasant
to
sit
idly
watching
the
changing
lights
on
the
water
and
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
wind
blowing
where
it
listed
around
them
was
the
faint
hum
of
the
insect
world
that
somehow
tells
us
summer
is
nearly
gone
one
by
one
they
had
declined
the
bay
trip
that
harcourt
had
proposed
he
turned
his
attention
then
to
an
acorn
basket
he
was
carving
for
philip
looking
up
after
a
while
to
remark
by
the
way
i
ran
across
that
man
smeltzer
up
at
the
station
a
little
while
ago
strange
that
he
should
come
to
a
place
like
this
for
his
vacation
is
it
you
think
now
did
you
talk
with
him
interrupted
pennybacker
looking
startled
yes
i
had
some
curiosity
to
see
if
he
would
remember
me
oh
yes
perfectly
is
he
registered
here
it
occurred
to
harcourt
that
pennybacker
was
taking
an
unusual
interest
in
smeltzer
must
be
i
guess
this
is
the
only
hotel
on
the
grounds
he
says
he
has
left
washington
i
rather
guess
from
something
he
said
that
he
is
with
the
pinkertons
margaret
had
risen
hastily
and
gone
to
the
end
of
the
porch
who
are
the
pinkertons
asked
bess
chapter
xviii
the
trail
of
the
serpent
where
is
philip
margaret
put
the
question
in
a
low
tense
voice
to
pennybacker
who
had
followed
her
he
was
down
there
at
the
spring
just
a
moment
ago
he
was
not
there
now
and
margaret
went
quickly
down
the
steps
and
looked
up
and
down
the
avenue
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
down
to
the
pier
he
was
nowhere
in
sight
she
turned
into
the
walk
leading
west
motioning
pennybacker
to
take
the
other
direction
well
my
audience
seems
to
have
melted
away
what
the
occasion
i
wonder
i
have
almost
lost
the
thread
of
my
discourse
you
were
talking
about
the
pinkertons
said
bess
who
was
herself
consumed
with
anxiety
but
kept
up
her
end
of
the
log
bravely
i
think
they
are
looking
for
philip
it
had
been
a
relief
to
them
all
to
drop
his
aliases
suppose
we
walk
up
towards
the
station
perhaps
he
is
there
harcourt
little
piece
of
news
had
thrown
margaret
into
the
greatest
alarm
what
but
a
purpose
and
that
a
menacing
one
would
bring
a
detective
from
washington
to
she
had
no
faith
in
smeltzer
change
of
residence
she
was
wondering
as
she
hurried
on
whether
she
would
know
him
if
she
should
come
upon
him
there
was
nothing
she
could
recall
about
his
appearance
except
that
he
wore
a
gray
suit
and
had
a
big
mustache
black
she
thought
where
was
philip
what
if
this
man
should
have
spirited
him
away
already
her
fears
proved
groundless
however
for
as
she
peered
anxiously
up
the
first
avenue
on
which
foot
of
beast
was
not
allowed
to
step
there
just
beyond
where
the
spring
set
round
with
ferns
bubbles
from
its
cement
confines
she
saw
him
standing
in
front
of
a
tiny
bungalow
it
was
a
modest
unpretentious
place
but
she
had
noticed
it
before
for
such
a
luxuriance
of
plant
life
enveloped
it
that
it
stood
out
with
a
distinction
all
its
own
even
in
this
place
of
beautiful
homes
a
curtain
of
climbing
nasturtiums
veiled
the
south
end
of
the
piazza
a
riotous
growth
of
scarlet
geraniums
and
foliage
plants
and
trailing
green
things
made
a
hanging
garden
round
the
porch
and
the
delicate
alleghany
vine
twined
itself
about
a
hardier
colleague
and
ran
races
with
it
up
the
posts
and
round
the
eaves
and
then
grown
tired
dropped
down
again
in
graceful
sprays
that
responded
to
every
wooing
breeze
those
flowers
grow
in
an
atmosphere
of
love
pennybacker
had
said
the
day
before
in
passing
by
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
their
roots
are
planted
in
the
soil
of
patient
care
and
intelligent
plant
knowledge
by
the
side
of
this
porch
garden
stood
a
little
lady
in
a
red
shawl
which
glowed
among
her
greens
and
matched
her
geraniums
and
at
her
side
his
hands
full
of
flowers
was
philip
why
dearest
cried
margaret
across
the
lawn
then
in
apology
to
the
lady
i
hope
my
little
one
has
not
troubled
you
not
in
the
least
she
stood
and
looked
so
longingly
at
the
flowers
that
i
called
her
in
even
then
she
only
said
you
think
you
could
spare
me
just
one
margaret
laughed
that
was
modest
certainly
but
a
little
suggestive
the
child
is
really
unusually
fond
of
flowers
i
thought
so
i
can
always
tell
when
the
true
love
is
there
i
often
hear
grown
people
say
am
fond
of
flowers
but
i
do
know
much
about
them
i
say
to
myself
have
the
true
love
or
you
would
know
then
looking
down
at
the
child
i
am
always
glad
to
share
with
those
who
have
it
especially
little
girls
that
ask
so
nicely
for
them
it
is
when
they
come
and
pick
them
without
asking
that
i
do
like
it
you
would
do
that
would
you
little
girl
philip
shook
his
head
and
looked
pleadingly
at
his
mother
the
look
being
interpreted
said
this
seems
to
be
a
very
pleasant
lady
i
just
tell
her
her
eyes
denied
him
you
have
a
beautiful
location
here
and
i
think
it
must
be
your
own
home
it
is
i
come
early
and
stay
late
is
a
lovely
spot
these
glimpses
of
the
water
are
charming
as
they
looked
down
toward
the
bay
her
grasp
on
philip
hand
tightened
he
looked
up
at
her
in
wonderment
and
tried
to
draw
away
but
she
held
him
as
in
a
vise
at
the
entrance
to
the
avenue
just
turning
into
it
was
a
man
with
a
big
mustache
and
a
gray
suit
she
was
sure
it
was
the
one
she
had
seen
at
the
island
house
he
was
headed
toward
her
come
dearest
we
must
go
no
not
that
way
and
with
a
hasty
word
to
their
surprised
acquaintance
of
the
bungalow
she
hurried
him
down
the
walk
leading
to
the
railroad
tracks
stopping
to
cast
a
glance
behind
her
as
she
turned
east
the
man
was
sauntering
up
the
walk
just
as
everybody
did
when
they
first
came
here
there
was
really
nothing
to
alarm
her
it
was
foolish
of
her
to
suppose
that
he
was
after
them
but
still
the
corner
turned
she
made
philip
run
to
keep
up
with
her
in
her
haste
at
the
corner
where
the
post
office
stands
she
turned
down
toward
the
hotel
but
the
boy
seeing
a
squirrel
across
the
street
escaped
from
her
grasp
and
ran
after
it
calling
him
sharply
margaret
followed
a
glance
back
showed
through
the
trees
a
glimpse
of
the
gray
suit
and
she
hurried
on
as
she
caught
up
with
philip
she
found
herself
in
front
of
a
pretty
cottage
close
to
the
walk
with
hanging
baskets
and
rustic
boxes
filled
with
ferns
around
its
many
porches
a
woman
was
sitting
at
a
table
writing
she
looked
up
at
the
child
with
a
smile
such
a
kind
gracious
smile
that
for
a
moment
margaret
contemplated
throwing
herself
on
her
mercy
and
begging
shelter
but
just
then
others
came
out
upon
the
porch
and
the
opportunity
was
past
they
had
come
now
to
the
back
of
the
yellow
house
that
harcourt
had
pointed
out
to
her
as
a
pioneer
she
had
noticed
it
often
since
philip
again
catching
sight
of
the
squirrel
in
the
clump
of
birches
with
the
hemlock
growing
sociably
in
their
midst
dashed
after
it
and
margaret
after
him
as
she
turned
into
the
yard
under
the
spreading
beech
trees
and
dodged
behind
them
a
backward
look
showed
her
the
man
in
the
gray
suit
standing
on
the
post
office
corner
looking
as
if
he
had
lost
a
clue
a
tall
lattice
divided
the
back
of
this
place
from
the
front
in
an
instant
margaret
had
caught
up
philip
and
dashed
to
the
other
side
of
it
she
was
leaning
weakly
against
it
and
philip
saying
why
mama
what
the
matter
when
a
door
opened
in
front
of
her
and
a
tall
lady
in
black
appeared
well
she
said
in
surprised
interrogative
which
was
not
in
the
least
aggressive
it
was
as
if
she
only
meant
to
understand
before
she
passed
judgment
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
but
my
little
b
my
little
girl
ran
into
your
yard
after
a
squirrel
and
i
came
to
get
her
i
i
feel
very
faint
would
you
mind
my
sitting
down
certainly
not
come
in
she
opened
the
door
through
which
she
had
come
out
and
margaret
who
had
supposed
the
door
led
into
the
house
found
herself
on
a
long
broad
porch
at
the
side
of
the
house
and
looking
out
upon
the
bay
in
front
there
were
curtains
on
the
east
side
and
it
was
a
homelike
place
with
rugs
and
rocking
chairs
and
tables
and
books
but
to
margaret
excited
imagination
it
was
but
a
place
where
one
could
be
spied
out
and
trapped
you
will
find
it
more
pleasant
here
nearer
the
front
the
lady
said
but
the
girl
drew
a
chair
into
the
furthest
corner
saying
something
about
the
wind
and
sat
down
with
philip
held
tightly
in
her
arms
then
desperate
with
the
fear
that
any
moment
might
bring
her
enemy
upon
her
she
asked
in
a
choking
voice
is
is
there
a
place
that
i
could
lie
down
why
certainly
come
right
in
and
lie
down
on
my
sofa
inside
the
room
which
had
a
glazed
door
and
a
broad
window
looking
out
over
the
water
margaret
hesitated
and
then
instead
of
lying
down
on
the
mahogany
sofa
drew
close
to
her
rescuer
i
am
not
ill
she
said
seizing
the
soft
hand
of
the
elder
woman
and
speaking
quickly
it
was
only
an
excuse
to
get
inside
but
i
am
in
deep
trouble
will
you
not
help
me
how
can
i
help
you
my
child
what
is
your
trouble
a
man
is
following
me
is
trying
to
get
my
child
i
do
know
whether
he
saw
me
come
in
here
or
not
but
if
he
comes
oh
do
not
let
him
get
us
he
shall
not
see
you
if
you
do
not
wish
to
be
seen
but
if
he
should
force
himself
in
he
will
not
try
that
i
think
then
with
gentle
courteous
directness
is
this
man
your
husband
has
he
any
right
to
the
child
oh
no
no
my
husband
she
hesitated
took
one
more
look
into
the
strong
forceful
face
before
her
and
trusted
it
my
husband
is
dead
i
have
time
to
explain
but
his
brother
is
trying
to
get
my
child
oh
there
that
man
now
for
a
step
was
heard
on
the
west
porch
and
coming
around
to
the
glazed
door
go
into
that
bedroom
said
the
lady
quickly
pointing
to
an
open
door
and
do
be
afraid
it
proved
to
be
a
boy
distributing
notices
as
the
lady
went
outside
to
pick
the
paper
up
she
looked
around
casually
the
was
nearly
in
and
several
persons
were
hurrying
down
the
pier
to
meet
it
a
man
in
a
gray
suit
was
standing
on
the
sidewalk
but
a
few
feet
from
her
west
porch
looking
as
if
he
were
undecided
about
something
as
she
turned
to
go
in
he
raised
his
hat
and
spoke
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
but
i
am
looking
for
a
lady
and
a
little
boy
friends
of
mine
that
i
have
got
separated
from
perhaps
you
have
i
saw
a
lady
and
a
little
child
pass
here
a
few
minutes
ago
she
said
quietly
are
they
the
ones
down
there
on
the
pier
i
do
see
very
well
he
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
a
woman
about
margaret
build
with
a
child
was
hurrying
toward
the
boat
with
hasty
thanks
he
started
after
them
when
margaret
trembling
came
out
from
the
inner
room
the
lady
had
taken
a
glass
that
she
always
kept
on
her
window
ledge
and
turned
it
on
the
man
hurrying
to
the
dock
what
sort
of
looking
man
was
this
there
was
something
about
her
quiet
manner
with
its
reserve
force
that
quieted
the
frightened
girl
he
had
a
black
mustache
a
very
long
one
and
wore
a
gray
suit
i
remember
anything
else
this
is
the
one
i
am
sure
well
he
asked
me
for
information
and
i
gave
it
to
him
i
should
not
have
volunteered
it
still
i
am
not
sure
but
it
was
a
falsehood
though
it
was
the
truth
i
really
suppose
a
thing
can
sometimes
be
both
do
you
here
your
eyes
are
younger
than
mine
take
the
glass
can
you
see
him
yes
cried
margaret
excitedly
the
boat
has
stopped
and
he
is
running
to
make
it
oh
he
wo
get
there
they
are
taking
in
the
plank
no
they
are
waiting
for
him
he
has
got
on
the
boat
is
pushing
off
and
there
is
a
soul
left
on
the
dock
then
you
are
safe
for
a
while
at
least
it
will
take
him
the
best
part
of
an
hour
to
get
back
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
i
must
leave
this
place
at
once
cried
margaret
can
you
tell
me
about
the
trains
yes
they
go
to
petoskey
every
half
hour
but
this
is
a
dummy
line
and
ends
at
petoskey
shall
you
risk
staying
there
the
place
is
very
accessible
from
no
i
should
dare
to
do
that
we
will
go
back
to
mackinac
as
soon
as
we
can
get
a
train
out
of
petoskey
i
should
lose
no
time
you
could
hardly
be
ready
for
the
next
train
which
comes
in
fifteen
minutes
but
if
you
make
the
one
following
it
will
connect
you
with
the
and
for
mackinac
oh
thank
you
so
much
it
is
such
a
help
to
know
this
at
parting
margaret
pressed
her
lips
to
the
elder
woman
soft
cheek
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
i
knew
i
could
trust
you
on
the
porch
philip
turned
back
a
chipmunk
had
just
run
up
the
steps
and
stood
looking
at
them
are
the
squirrels
your
children
he
asked
politely
my
children
she
was
not
used
to
the
fanciful
vagaries
of
a
brain
no
my
dear
i
have
any
children
oh
said
philip
disappointed
the
other
lady
said
the
flowers
were
children
and
i
thought
maybe
the
squirrels
were
yours
goodby
when
margaret
got
to
the
hotel
pennybacker
was
partly
packed
she
had
foreseen
what
the
next
move
would
be
john
harcourt
swore
softly
she
is
the
most
capricious
woman
i
ever
saw
he
declared
to
bess
on
the
dummy
now
we
cheated
out
of
that
inland
trip
again
suppose
you
stay
over
and
take
the
inland
trip
alone
she
suggested
then
you
could
make
sure
of
it
we
have
any
baggage
that
needs
attending
to
i
suppose
i
am
needed
only
in
the
capacity
of
baggage
tender
he
reproached
her
at
petoskey
after
putting
them
on
the
train
he
stepped
outside
and
delayed
his
coming
back
until
bess
began
to
wonder
if
he
had
taken
her
at
her
word
but
he
swung
himself
on
as
the
train
started
i
just
seen
smeltzer
out
on
the
platform
funny
how
i
run
across
that
fellow
he
on
his
way
to
chicago
says
is
too
slow
for
him
had
to
go
to
harbor
springs
to
get
a
drink
margaret
in
her
safe
corner
with
philip
close
beside
her
and
the
train
speeding
away
from
smeltzer
was
thinking
i
wonder
if
that
could
all
have
been
imagination
perhaps
he
was
the
man
at
all
chapter
xix
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
sea
the
morning
after
they
got
back
to
mackinac
margaret
invited
harcourt
to
take
a
walk
with
her
and
for
almost
the
first
time
since
he
had
known
her
she
left
philip
behind
bess
looked
at
them
a
little
wonderingly
when
they
went
out
and
still
more
so
when
they
returned
for
margaret
face
showed
traces
of
tears
and
john
harcourt
was
unusually
serious
she
had
led
the
way
to
the
fort
steps
and
on
the
top
landing
where
so
many
confidences
have
been
shared
she
told
him
her
story
she
had
agreed
with
pennybacker
the
night
before
that
the
time
had
come
now
when
he
should
be
told
it
seemed
almost
his
right
she
had
told
it
very
simply
not
striving
after
effect
but
the
pathos
of
that
story
was
in
the
situation
not
in
any
words
that
might
be
used
to
depict
it
harcourt
was
strongly
moved
by
what
he
heard
as
they
neared
the
hotel
on
their
return
she
said
to
him
i
am
known
here
only
as
osborne
perhaps
you
better
continue
to
call
me
so
let
me
call
you
margaret
he
begged
i
can
not
bear
to
call
you
by
a
false
name
and
i
do
not
dare
to
use
your
true
one
and
she
consented
for
she
felt
that
her
confidence
far
more
than
anything
that
he
could
call
her
had
set
the
seal
upon
their
friendship
after
this
he
fell
into
the
habit
of
looking
out
for
her
of
going
to
the
boats
when
they
came
in
and
haunting
the
hotels
true
smeltzer
had
told
him
he
was
on
his
way
to
chicago
but
he
had
not
implicit
confidence
in
that
gentleman
word
but
though
he
kept
up
a
close
surreptitious
watch
no
smeltzer
appeared
it
was
perhaps
a
week
after
this
that
the
party
with
the
exception
of
pennybacker
started
off
for
a
two
days
trip
up
to
the
soo
as
the
interesting
little
town
of
sault
sainte
marie
with
its
rapids
and
its
great
ship
canal
is
called
they
went
off
in
high
spirits
and
a
little
later
pennybacker
saw
their
handkerchiefs
waving
to
her
from
the
little
steamer
indeed
margaret
had
seemed
like
another
person
after
learning
that
smeltzer
was
on
his
way
to
chicago
that
proved
to
her
that
he
was
not
looking
for
her
or
that
he
had
given
up
the
search
in
this
part
of
the
country
at
any
rate
there
was
probably
no
safer
place
for
them
anywhere
now
than
right
here
the
boat
was
almost
ready
to
start
when
they
reached
it
and
they
lost
no
time
in
securing
good
places
on
the
landward
side
of
the
stern
where
they
could
see
all
that
was
to
be
seen
of
the
receding
island
this
took
them
away
from
the
dock
side
to
philip
great
distress
and
margaret
said
at
last
go
over
to
that
side
where
you
can
watch
them
if
you
want
to
philip
joyfully
obeyed
and
from
the
deck
looked
down
with
a
child
interest
on
the
moving
life
below
this
was
immensely
more
interesting
to
him
than
any
view
of
land
or
sea
could
be
he
was
not
alone
in
the
feeling
a
man
below
who
was
evidently
not
a
dock
hand
stood
idly
scanning
the
people
on
deck
a
little
child
with
long
curls
and
a
girl
hat
and
dress
leaned
over
the
railing
the
man
had
formed
the
habit
of
noticing
children
a
very
pleasant
habit
in
any
one
but
somewhat
unusual
in
a
man
of
his
type
hello
little
girl
he
called
up
philip
ignored
the
friendly
greeting
the
situation
was
very
cruel
it
was
bad
enough
to
have
to
wear
these
detestable
girl
clothes
but
to
be
taunted
with
femininity
by
a
person
he
had
never
in
his
life
seen
before
this
was
rather
too
much
his
mother
had
cautioned
him
never
to
speak
to
strangers
and
never
upon
any
account
to
disclose
the
secret
of
his
sex
but
his
mother
was
now
at
the
other
side
of
the
boat
and
he
felt
sure
he
was
leaving
this
man
for
good
the
was
even
now
drawing
in
her
cable
he
looked
around
him
dropped
his
voice
to
a
safe
pitch
and
announced
defiantly
as
the
boat
pulled
off
i
is
any
girl
i
a
boy
the
devil
you
are
the
man
said
whistling
softly
and
swung
himself
over
the
low
rail
the
marine
view
with
mackinac
receding
in
the
west
is
not
so
beautiful
as
the
approach
from
the
other
side
but
it
was
attractive
enough
to
enlist
the
close
attention
of
our
party
as
long
as
there
was
a
green
shore
in
sight
upon
my
word
said
harcourt
at
last
looking
off
to
the
north
there
is
the
that
tells
us
we
will
soon
be
at
our
first
i
go
down
and
see
what
the
chances
are
for
dinner
he
came
back
in
a
few
moments
and
drew
his
chair
close
to
margaret
i
do
want
to
alarm
you
unnecessarily
but
i
am
afraid
there
is
trouble
ahead
of
us
i
have
just
seen
that
fellow
smeltzer
again
yes
down
on
the
lower
deck
margaret
called
philip
to
her
and
caught
him
up
with
a
despairing
gesture
do
you
really
suppose
he
is
after
us
she
asked
with
dry
lips
i
am
afraid
he
is
i
should
have
said
anything
about
it
if
it
been
for
a
word
i
overheard
him
say
to
the
captain
about
his
being
an
officer
and
authorized
to
take
into
custody
when
he
reached
the
but
what
can
i
do
asked
margaret
there
is
no
possible
chance
now
to
get
away
i
think
said
harcourt
after
a
moment
thought
that
i
would
take
a
stateroom
and
keep
philip
out
of
sight
until
i
can
have
a
talk
with
the
man
i
will
try
to
make
an
opportunity
without
exciting
his
suspicions
if
i
find
out
definitely
that
it
is
you
he
was
talking
about
i
think
perhaps
it
might
be
well
for
you
to
invoke
the
assistance
and
do
lose
heart
we
have
the
day
before
us
in
which
to
concoct
some
scheme
to
outwit
him
but
on
the
water
margaret
said
despairingly
she
went
at
once
to
see
the
stewardess
about
a
room
philip
frightened
and
mystified
at
her
still
face
clinging
to
her
and
bess
following
not
much
less
alarmed
the
stewardess
was
a
buxom
irish
girl
and
if
ever
a
face
indicated
a
good
heart
it
was
norah
brannigan
looking
into
it
and
realizing
her
sore
need
of
a
friend
margaret
called
her
into
the
room
after
she
had
sent
bess
back
to
harcourt
took
the
woman
freckled
hand
and
poured
out
her
sorrows
and
her
fears
and
would
she
not
help
her
in
her
desperate
need
she
had
thrown
herself
upon
an
utter
stranger
but
she
had
not
read
amiss
the
honest
face
i
help
you
sure
mem
and
it
is
norah
brannigan
will
do
that
same
i
wud
do
it
for
the
swate
eyes
of

darlint
to
say

and
what

wantin
me

said
margaret
hurriedly
brought
face
to
face
with
the
emergency
by
norah
question
hide
us
anywhere
you
can
about
the
boat
down
in
the
hold
if
you
have
any
other
place
she
said
it
with
a
vague
remembrance
of
the
stowaways
crossing
the
ocean
thus
and
then
tell
him
that
we
are
not
here
that
we
have
fallen
overboard
anything
to
throw
him
off
the
track
then
with
sudden
fear

not
true

my
boy

shtandin
on
the
dock
to
this
blissed
child
jist
as
we

after

and
then
he
took
a
handspring
he
did
over
the
rail
philip
mama
mama
i
did
say
anything
only
only
it
ended
in
a
burst
of
weeping
only
what
philip
she
was
wild
with
anxiety

only
that
that
mama
i
thes
told

oh
philip
philip
while
mother
and
son
were
thus
reckoning
their
accounts
norah
brannigan
had
on
her
thinking
cap
and
this
article
on
the
head
of
an
irish
girl
often
covers
quick
wits
you
are
dead
sure
mem
that
this
man
will
get

child
once
we
reach
the
oh
yes

i
am
perfectly
certain
of
it
now
well
said
norah
brannigan
with
an
encouraging
wink
of
her
left
eye
what
the
matter
wid
givin
him
the
shlip
how
can
i
away
off
here
in
the
lake
margaret
asked
despairingly
we
are
not
in
the
lake
now
mem
nor
in
the
straits
of
mackinac
nayther
we
are
at
this
moment
enterin
mary
river
mem
and
sure
it
is
a
good
omen
that
it
is
named
for
a
mother
that
had
to
run
off
wid
her
own
child
pray
to
her
mem
pray
to
her
then
her
religious
sense
appeased
she
went
on
with
shrewd
acumen
and
wud
ye
take
a
chance
now
i
would
do
anything
anything
and
cud
the
or
whichever
it
is
by
that
time
she
was
looking
down
sternly
at
philip
winking
one
eye
at
margaret
meantime
cud
he
be
depinded
on
mem
because
added
norah
brannigan
cruelly
ef
he
should
turn
baby
now
and
git
skeered
and
cry
or
blab
she
spoke
slowly
that
he
might
take
it
all
in
and
philip
was
regarding
her
with
the
closest
attention
why
he
wud
upset
our
whole
kittle
o
fish
mem
philip
turned
to
his
mother
with
the
most
earnest
protestation
mama
i
i
wo
cwy
or
or
or
upset
any
fish
i
think
said
margaret
taking
the
little
face
between
her
palms
and
looking
searchingly
into
his
eyes
i
think
i
believe
that
he
can
be
depended
on
now
what
is
your
plan
the
stewardess
took
her
to
the
stateroom
window
and
pointed
over
to
the
mainland
at
the
left
ye
see
them
houses
and
the
shmoke
there
just
beyant
the
on
the
point
yes
yes
that
mem
is
detour
our
first
shtop
within
the
hour
we
be
there
and
well
and
there
said
norah
brannigan
with
a
nod
and
a
significant
closing
of
her
left
optic
is
where
we
give
him
the
shlip
oh
we
ca
we
ca
cried
margaret
in
despair
do
you
know
that
he
will
be
on
the
watch
for
everybody
that
leaves
the
boat
if
there
was
only
somebody
there
to
help
us
margaret
groaned
but
alone
sure
mem
and
there
is
who
michael
callaghan
and
who
is
michael
callaghan
a
dock
hand
at
detour
and
as
foine
a
as
ye
cud
wush
to
see
then
with
a
very
conscious
look
on
her
honest
face
and
what
michael
callaghan
wuddent
do
for
norah
brannigan
why
mem
it
ca
be
done
now
set
down
here
on
the
berth
darlint
and
let
me
tell
ye
me
plan
as
the
made
the
landing
at
detour
bess
and
john
harcourt
stood
on
deck
just
above
the
gangway
and
watched
the
scene
with
interest
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
bess
had
many
disturbing
qualms
of
conscience
at
enjoying
anything
while
margaret
shut
up
in
her
stateroom
was
in
such
straits
she
felt
that
she
ought
to
go
and
share
her
isolation
but
harcourt
had
pointed
out
that
if
smeltzer
happened
to
be
sauntering
around
it
would
be
better
for
it
to
appear
that
they
were
not
on
their
guard
he
convinced
her
that
there
would
be
ample
time
for
conference
and
sympathy
after
they
left
detour
and
she
might
as
well
see
what
was
to
be
seen
there
there
is
something
very
fascinating
about
watching
a
boat
unloading
at
a
country
landing
and
in
the
end
she
yielded
and
stayed
compounding
with
her
conscience
by
a
vow
to
go
the
minute
the
boat
started
again
detour
is
on
the
west
side
of
mary
river
and
has
an
unusually
broad
dock
with
a
warehouse
at
the
right
and
another
much
farther
back
on
the
left
this
makes
a
broad
frontage
which
was
unbroken
that
day
by
even
a
or
a
barrel
if
norah
brannigan
was
hoping
to
hide
her
proteges
behind
a
chance
pile
of
lumber
or
the
usual
impedimenta
of
a
dock
there
seemed
scant
hope
for
her
here
detour
had
all
the
time
there
was
and
used
it
in
taking
care
of
her
freight
the
road
trailed
off
up
the
hill
where
was
the
store
a
blacksmith
shop
and
a
somewhat
pretentious
hotel
on
the
dock
lounged
half
a
dozen
men
who
enlivened
the
time
of
waiting
by
sparring
with
one
another
a
coil
of
rope
was
thrown
out
to
one
of
them
who
caught
it
with
a
dextrous
hand
in
a
moment
the
great
cable
was
over
the
post
and
the
crunching
against
the
timbers
of
the
dock
then
the
gangway
was
shoved
out
and
the
passengers
were
going
off
how
many
do
you
say
will
get
off
said
harcourt
quick
oh
twenty
twenty
i
say
four
caramels
against
a
cigar
all
right
one
man
followed
by
a
dog
had
already
stepped
ashore
a
country
woman
in
a
blue
calico
with
a
dejected
looking
back
and
a
sunbonnet
followed
and
then
a
boy
that
was
all
the
dock
hands
brought
out
a
couple
of
plows
a
crated
sewing
machine
and
a
white
iron
bedstead
with
brass
knobs
then
they
went
aboard
and
reappeared
in
a
minute
with
a
line
of
wheelbarrows
loaded
with
soap
boxes
nail
kegs
etc
detour
evidently
bought
by
the
small
quantity
are
the
passengers
all
gone
asked
bess
incredulously
surely
that
is
all
that
all
i
won
as
usual
you
did
win
you
said
four
and
there
were
only
three
four

just
three

ca
count
there
were
four
passengers
two
men
one
woman
and
a
dog
there
fifty
cents

the
last
wheelbarrow
trundled
by
a
sturdy
irish
lad
had
in
it
a
with
a
apron
tied
neatly
over
it
look
out
there
moike
cried
the
stewardess
springing
to
the
side
of
the
basket
and
steadying
it
across
the
narrow
gangway
do
ye
drop
me
table
linen
or
ye
might
git
dropped
yeself
see
she
said
it
with
a
saucy
air
and
leaned
toward
him
threatening
a
friendly
cuff
which
he
dodged
while
the
man
in
front
looked
back
and
laughed
good
humoredly
give
it
to
him
he
said
she
just
wants
to
flirt
with
him
said
harcourt
that
the
way
you
all
make
fools
of
us
well
i
do
suppose
they
have
much
to
enliven
their
days
as
he
said
it
was
not
much
time
that
norah
had
with
her
sweetheart
that
day
but
it
was
enough
as
the
cable
was
pulled
in
she
called
out
gayly
put
them
clothes
in
the
warehouse
moike
till
the
comes
she
be
there
two
the
woman
in
the
blue
calico
was
toiling
up
the
dusty
street
she
had
not
waited
to
see
the
unloading
as
the
boat
headed
bess
started
up
i
go
and
see
about
margaret
i
feel
too
mean
for
anything
wait
just
a
minute
and
see
these
islands
are
they
pretty
they
were
indeed
and
of
assorted
sizes
some
tiny
disks
of
green
some
larger
with
low
grassy
banks
extending
out
from
the
copse
like
a
green
fringe
and
beyond
the
wooded
shores
of
joseph
which
looked
as
if
it
might
be
the
mainland
but
bess
would
not
stay
to
see
she
was
not
gone
long
when
she
came
back
she
looked
cautiously
around
and
went
close
up
to
him
margaret
is
gone
chapter
xx
gone
gone
where
do
talk
so
loud
she
got
off
at
detour
and
is
going
back
to
mackinac
on
the
down
boat
this
afternoon
why
how
could
she
have
got
off
at
detour
he
asked
incredulously
we
saw
every
living
soul
that
left
the
boat
there
was
only
one
woman
and
that
one
was
margaret
the
one
in
the
blue
calico
well
i
be
jiggered
he
said
most
inelegantly
we
are
two
babes
in
the
woods
are
we
i
hope
smeltzer
will
be
as
dead
easy
and
by
jove
i
think
he
was
for
i
saw
him
standing
right
by
that
gangway
as
she
went
off
talk
so
loud
they
went
then
up
into
the
bow
beyond
the
chance
of
being
overheard
and
he
asked
breathlessly
where
is
philip
and
why
did
she
leave
him
leave
him
why
she
would
leave
philip
any
more
than
she
would
leave
an
arm
he
went
with
her
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
he
said
severely
that
philip
too
walked
off
before
our
very
eyes
and
we
did
know
it
i
suppose
he
went
as
the
dog
do
you
remember
what
was
in
that
last
wheelbarrow
no
wait
let
me
think
was
that
the
one
with
the
in
it
that
the
stewardess
helped
the
man
off
with
she
said
it
was
her
table
linen
well
for
a
man
that
can
guess
at
the
number
of
passengers
and
their
destination
as
you
can
making
your
cigars
off
of
innocent
trusting
unsophisticated
damsels
you
certainly
are
at
times
most
astonishingly
dull
do
you
mean
to
say
that
philip
was
why
of
course
tied
down
snugly
under
the
blue
check
apron
well
by
george
he
was
game
and
that
stewardess
i
hope
she
will
get
her
reward
in
heaven
she
getting
a
part
of
it
on
earth
when
margaret
found
that
the
woman
would
take
money
for
her
help
she
took
off
her
watch
and
gave
it
to
her
telling
her
that
she
must
wear
it
because
it
was
hers
and
miss
brannigan
is
now
shut
up
in
a
stateroom
pinning
and
unpinning
in
a
most
ecstatic
state
of
mind
and
saying
probably
as
she
was
when
i
left
her
sure
mem
what
will
michael
callahan
think
of
me
now
wid
me
gould
watch
and
pin
did
she
leave
a
letter
or
anything
yes
just
a
note
for
me
most
of
it
was
taken
up
with
telling
me
how
sorry
she
was
to
leave
me
in
such
a
position
but
how
she
could
help
it
that
it
was
her
one
chance
and
she
must
take
it
that
norah
would
tell
me
all
the
details
and
that
i
would
know
by
the
time
the
letter
reached
me
whether
it
had
failed
mercy
if
she
only
gets
off
with
him
she
need
think
of
me
anyway
it
is
as
if
i
were
left
by
myself
of
course
grandma
will
be
uneasy
about
me
she
is
so
afraid
of
water
but
she
will
be
glad
i
am
with
you
i
know
that
because
i
heard
her
tell
margaret
one
day
that
she
knew
you
were
a
man
that
could
be
trusted
bet
i
am
thought
harcourt
looking
down
into
the
innocent
girlish
face
aloud
he
said
what
do
you
think
we
better
do
the
aspect
of
the
case
that
troubled
margaret
had
already
appealed
to
him
why
there
is
anything
we
can
do
but
go
on
is
there
nothing
that
i
can
see
unless
i
put
you
in
another
basket
and
chuck
you
off
at
sailor
encampment
that
the
only
stop
between
detour
and
the
soo
say
what
oh
nothing
it
was
not
worth
while
to
alarm
her
but
a
startling
thought
had
struck
him
suppose
smeltzer
finding
out
that
she
had
escaped
him
should
get
off
at
sailor
encampment
wait
for
the
down
boat
and
be
on
it
waiting
for
her
when
she
took
it
at
detour
then
he
felt
sure
that
the
quick
wit
that
had
thought
of
a
way
of
escape
in
the
first
place
would
have
thought
of
that
the
stewardess
was
acquainted
with
the
time
schedule
if
he
was
not
still
the
fear
haunted
him
until
they
had
left
sailor
encampment
behind
them
and
looking
down
he
saw
smeltzer
below
at
the
gangway
it
was
funny
the
way
smeltzer
hugged
the
gangway
when
they
made
a
landing
after
that
he
gave
himself
up
to
a
boyish
enjoyment
of
the
trip
they
were
there
without
a
chaperon
it
was
true
but
it
was
through
no
fault
of
either
one
and
it
was
all
right
the
trouble
almost
always
was
with
the
gossip
that
such
things
gave
rise
to
not
in
the
things
themselves
and
here
there
was
nobody
to
gossip
still
he
had
it
on
his
mind
and
said
to
bess
just
before
getting
into
sault
sainte
marie
you
any
acquaintances
here
that
you
could
spend
the
night
with
not
a
soul
would
you
like
for
me
to
look
you
up
a
quiet
boarding
house
why
no
i
think
not
just
for
one
night
we
start
down
early
in
the
morning
do
we
yes
after
a
pause
during
which
he
did
some
thinking
he
said
again
perhaps
i
better
take
you
to
the
iroquois
and
go
down
myself
to
the
house
just
below
i
forget
the
name
why
no
she
said
surprised
i
rather
go
where
you
go
i
think
grandma
would
want
me
to
be
at
a
hotel
alone
he
gave
it
up
then
when
they
reached
the
dock
smeltzer
was
the
first
man
to
step
ashore
he
took
his
station
beside
the
gangway
he
had
watched
it
from
the
time
they
had
left
mackinac
and
he
was
not
going
to
be
cheated
out
of
his
reward
now
there
was
an
exultant
look
in
his
eye
it
seemed
to
harcourt
as
from
the
upper
deck
he
watched
the
man
you
better
go
on
ahead
he
said
to
bess
and
among
the
first
i
will
catch
up
with
you
no
i
do
know
that
he
associates
me
at
all
with
your
party
and
i
do
even
know
that
he
would
recognize
you
as
belonging
to
it
but
it
is
just
as
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
he
saw
her
run
the
gauntlet
unchallenged
smeltzer
was
looking
for
a
woman
and
a
child
he
had
spent
the
last
few
minutes
before
the
boat
stopped
in
studying
a
picture
he
had
in
his
possession
one
after
another
passed
out
but
no
woman
and
child
harcourt
could
have
jumped
up
and
down
with
delight
to
see
smeltzer
look
of
anticipated
triumph
merge
slowly
into
anxiety
and
then
to
mystified
chagrin
nothing
but
a
realization
that
it
might
be
an
awkward
position
for
him
prevented
his
staying
to
witness
the
detective
interview
with
the
captain
that
one
was
impending
was
evident
from
the
man
face
the
last
passenger
to
leave
the
boat
was
harcourt
hello
smeltzer
you
here
you
did
get
off
to
chicago
no
said
smeltzer
curtly
starting
back
across
the
gangway
harcourt
hurried
on
after
bess
they
had
walked
but
a
little
way
when
she
said
in
great
perturbation
oh
i
left
my
umbrella
ca
we
go
back
for
it
they
had
reached
the
boat
and
he
was
stepping
aboard
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
sound
of
smeltzer
voice
in
altercation
with
the
captain
and
the
stewardess
as
they
stood
at
the
head
of
the
gangway
then
she
on
this
boat
they
heard
him
say
did
any
woman
get
off
at
detour
asked
the
captain
yis
sor
the
was
there
any
child
none
that
i
seen
what
was
in
that
demanded
smeltzer
with
sudden
suspicion
not
a
thing
but
me
sor
and
that
the
lord
truth
ef
i
was
to
die
fur
it
said
the
woman
whose
heart
it
would
to
lie
to
a
vilyan
like
that
come
on
said
harcourt
drawing
bess
back
we
better
get
out
of
this
you
and
i
ca
compete
with
we
are
not
in
her
class
buy
you
an
umbrella
if
you
need
it
of
course
they
stopped
at
the
locks
the
first
thing
everybody
does
it
was
while
they
were
standing
there
that
he
said
in
a
low
voice
look
over
to
the
other
side
that
smeltzer
rushing
for
the
station
and
the
train
has
just
gone
oh
has
it
yes
and
there
is
another
till
morning
i
have
just
enquired
that
will
give
her
twelve
or
fifteen
hours
the
start
she
ca
get
off
the
island
can
she
no
but
she
wo
lose
much
time
in
the
morning
i
wager
it
is
a
most
fascinating
occupation
watching
the
locks
at
the
soo
there
is
always
the
temptation
to
stay
for
one
more
performance
and
they
come
thick
and
fast
on
this
famous
ship
canal
they
stayed
till
the
throes
of
hunger
sent
them
across
the
park
to
the
hotel
she
stood
beside
him
as
he
registered
but
when
he
caught
her
eye
and
laughed
afterwards
she
did
not
respond
very
heartily
being
on
the
water
has
made
me
awfully
sleepy
she
said
at
the
dinner
table
i
think
i
shall
write
a
letter
to
grandma
and
go
to
bed
you
will
get
there
as
soon
as
the
letter
will
no
if
it
goes
down
in
the
morning
it
will
get
there
by
noon
that
will
be
some
help
it
is
moonlight
he
pleaded
let
go
over
to
the
locks
for
an
hour
or
so
no
i
sleepy
i
going
to
bed
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
had
in
some
way
offended
her
he
went
out
alone
after
she
had
gone
to
her
room
and
walked
up
and
down
the
sidewalk
between
the
park
and
the
locks
the
place
was
most
beautiful
by
moonlight
but
he
was
not
thinking
much
about
its
beauty
or
its
wonders
his
mind
was
dwelling
on
the
strangeness
of
their
position
on
bess
sweet
childish
womanliness
but
most
of
all
on
margaret
and
what
she
would
do
next
how
glad
he
would
be
if
he
were
only
able
to
dispel
the
shadow
that
had
fallen
upon
her
the
next
morning
as
they
stood
beside
the
locks
where
they
had
agreed
to
stay
until
the
boat
went
bess
asked
abruptly
why
did
you
write
our
names
on
the
hotel
register
harcourt
and
sister
i
did
like
that
very
well
because
it
seemed
as
if
i
as
if
we
had
done
something
you
were
ashamed
of
her
lips
were
in
a
pretty
childish
pout
he
placed
his
hand
on
his
heart
with
a
gesture
of
exaggerated
sentiment
i
did
that
because
i
wanted
to
make
sure
of
your
bearing
my
name
at
least
once
in
your
life
you
know
you
told
me
the
other
day
you
intended
to
be
an
old
maid
so
this
was
the
only
way
silly
she
said
blushing
and
looking
away
when
they
got
back
to
mackinac
that
night
bess
found
a
room
bearing
evidence
of
hasty
packing
and
a
letter
from
her
grandmother
my
dear
child
it
said
i
am
going
to
leave
you
for
a
little
while
margaret
needs
me
now
far
more
than
you
do
and
i
can
not
be
with
both
of
course
you
got
her
letter
and
know
what
she
did
and
why
when
she
came
in
last
night
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
i
certainly
hope
the
lord
will
reward
that
girl
according
to
her
works
and
smeltzer
too
of
course
we
will
have
to
go
away
at
once
we
shall
be
starting
somewhere
within
an
hour
where
i
do
not
know
we
will
go
where
the
lord
directs
and
stop
when
he
tells
us
to
as
soon
as
i
know
anything
further
i
will
let
you
know
it
in
the
meantime
you
must
stay
just
where
you
are
until
you
hear
have
everything
packed
and
ready
to
go
at
a
moment
notice
though
i
think
i
shall
write
instead
of
telegraphing
say
to
harcourt
for
me
and
tell
him
i
sincerely
hope
that
we
may
meet
again
some
time
ask
him
to
go
over
to
mackinaw
city
with
you
when
i
write
for
you
to
come
and
see
about
your
trunks
by
the
way
we
leave
ours
for
you
to
bring
it
would
be
easier
to
track
us
if
we
had
to
check
look
here
said
harcourt
when
he
had
got
this
far
in
the
letter
she
had
brought
it
directly
down
to
him
and
they
were
reading
it
in
the
parlor
do
you
suppose
she
expects
to
shake
me
like
this
well
anyway
said
bess
i
am
glad
i
am
not
entirely
alone
the
letter
ended
may
god
bless
you
my
child
and
keep
you
safe
from
all
harm
is
the
prayer
of
your
devoted
grandmother
there
was
a
yearning
note
in
the
closing
sentence
that
was
at
variance
with
the
confident
tone
of
the
earlier
part
in
truth
pennybacker
had
been
torn
between
loyalty
to
margaret
and
love
for
bess
well
said
john
harcourt
as
he
handed
the
letter
back
to
her
he
really
looked
more
cheerful
than
bess
felt
there
nothing
to
do
but
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
situation
suppose
we
take
a
walk
up
to
the
fort
in
the
morning
and
talk
it
over
they
had
time
to
talk
that
and
many
other
things
over
in
the
three
days
that
elapsed
before
the
letter
came
harcourt
felt
it
his
duty
to
amuse
and
interest
her
during
what
was
a
trying
period
of
waiting
and
was
unremitting
in
his
attentions
the
letter
came
at
last
she
read
it
on
the
porch
and
handed
it
to
him
it
had
got
to
the
point
now
where
she
gave
him
her
full
confidence
it
ran
south
haven
dear
bess
at
last
we
are
settled
and
i
embrace
the
first
opportunity
to
write
for
i
fear
you
have
been
consumed
with
anxiety
and
i
have
been
said
bess
when
he
looked
at
her
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
but
i
did
think
it
was
necessary
to
cry
my
eyes
out
well
to
begin
at
the
beginning
we
started
on
the
first
boat
that
left
the
island
for
mackinaw
city
a
very
few
minutes
after
my
letter
to
you
was
finished
and
were
soon
on
the
cars
headed
south
we
only
went
as
far
as
petoskey
however
for
i
remembered
that
there
we
could
take
the
pere
marquette
directly
to
chicago
which
would
save
time
we
bought
tickets
to
that
point
being
uncertain
about
our
plans
and
thinking
that
we
might
consider
it
best
to
go
straight
on
to
missouri
but
you
know
i
told
you
we
should
go
where
the
lord
directed
us
and
stop
when
he
said
so
well
just
before
we
reached
grand
junction
a
little
station
where
a
branch
of
the
michigan
central
crosses
the
pere
marquette
i
heard
some
people
behind
me
talking
about
south
haven
what
a
nice
place
it
was
but
how
it
was
almost
deserted
now
i
thought
to
myself
that
a
deserted
place
was
about
the
kind
we
wanted
so
i
asked
them
some
questions
about
how
to
get
there
and
found
that
we
were
right
at
the
place
where
a
decision
must
be
made
for
we
would
have
to
take
the
other
road
at
grand
junction
i
went
to
margaret
and
told
her
it
seemed
to
me
the
lord
said
stop
and
she
agreed
with
me
then
we
began
to
hustle
if
we
had
had
our
trunks
we
never
could
have
done
it
for
we
had
only
about
three
minutes
but
when
the
train
stopped
at
grand
junction
we
stepped
off
and
let
it
go
on
to
chicago
without
us
this
was
blind
number
one
we
figured
that
if
that
man
should
try
to
trace
the
two
women
that
bought
tickets
in
petoskey
he
would
be
likely
to
follow
them
to
chicago
and
there
he
would
lose
the
scent
south
haven
is
directly
west
of
grand
junction
and
kalamazoo
the
other
end
of
this
little
branch
road
is
directly
east
we
bought
two
tickets
to
kalamazoo
making
a
good
many
inquiries
of
the
agent
about
the
railroad
connections
there
to
different
points
that
funny
said
bess
if
they
were
going
to
south
haven
not
at
all
returned
harcourt
that
was
blind
number
two
now
you
will
find
that
they
discarded
those
tickets
and
boarded
the
train
for
the
west
yes
sir
that
just
what
they
did
she
said
looking
ahead
that
cute
in
grandma
well
the
letter
proceeded
having
put
him
on
a
wrong
trail
if
the
thing
were
ever
inquired
into
we
went
out
on
the
platform
and
waited
for
the
train
there
were
a
lot
of
people
waiting
who
called
themselves
and
had
been
off
for
some
that
made
it
easier
for
us
to
lose
ourselves
the
train
came
along
in
a
little
while
and
we
got
on
intimating
to
the
conductor
that
we
had
time
to
procure
tickets
and
paying
our
fare
to
south
haven
look
here
said
harcourt
this
thing
is
catching
if
she
keeps
on
there
be
another
one
in
miss
brannigan
class
we
are
now
comfortably
established
at
a
boarding
house
called
the
oakland
where
they
have
a
queer
little
in
the
basement
and
the
best
brown
bread
you
ever
put
in
your
mouth
we
think
we
shall
settle
down
here
for
several
weeks
i
do
like
the
idea
of
going
back
to
missouri
just
now
for
that
man
would
be
sure
to
follow
us
there
there
are
some
objections
to
being
named
pennybacker
instead
of
smith
i
want
you
to
come
on
immediately
then
followed
a
page
or
more
of
minute
directions
as
to
route
bills
etc
i
do
know
whether
i
have
money
enough
for
all
that
said
bess
wrinkling
her
brow
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
over
the
financial
problem
i
lend
it
to
you
if
you
have
how
could
i
get
it
back
to
you
that
so
i
guess
i
have
to
go
down
with
you
and
collect
it
myself
really
cried
bess
sure
your
grandmother
left
you
in
my
care
and
i
not
going
to
prove
recreant
to
a
trust
at
this
late
day
besides
i
got
three
more
weeks
to
put
in
somewhere
before
i
can
go
back
to
washington
i
guess
south
haven
will
do
as
well
as
anywhere
else
do
you
want
me
to
go
why
yes
i
love
to
have
you
go
i
do
know
anything
about
attending
to
trunks
i
almost
know
i
could
manage
three
a
postscript
to
this
letter
said
i
have
written
at
length
about
that
grand
junction
business
because
i
thought
harcourt
would
feel
interested
in
hearing
about
it
and
we
will
not
see
him
again
and
that
where
she
going
to
fool
herself
he
said
with
a
grin
chapter
xxi
in
the
toils
september
was
almost
over
and
wild
asters
fringed
the
low
banks
of
black
river
now
and
the
cardinal
flower
bent
its
stately
head
to
peer
suspiciously
into
the
still
waters
seeing
there
a
line
of
red
so
vivid
that
it
might
well
pass
for
a
rival
the
grapevines
in
their
late
luxuriance
ran
riot
climbing
over
the
underbrush
that
grew
down
to
the
river
brink
and
pushing
out
across
old
trees
that
had
been
undermined
and
lay
half
buried
a
menace
to
the
boatman
but
a
joy
with
all
this
greenery
over
them
to
a
eye
here
and
there
a
sumach
threw
in
a
needed
touch
of
color
or
a
maple
lifted
a
flaming
branch
they
were
much
upon
the
river
in
these
days
it
was
pleasant
to
get
away
from
the
people
though
there
were
not
many
left
south
haven
was
very
quiet
the
boatmen
were
laying
up
their
boats
preparatory
to
the
winter
painting
the
crowds
were
gone
the
steamers
had
taken
back
to
the
great
city
across
the
lake
regretful
loads
of
summer
visitors
who
could
not
tarry
to
see
the
river
in
its
autumn
glory
this
was
hard
for
those
who
went
but
very
pleasant
for
those
who
stayed
they
had
plenty
of
room
and
nothing
to
mar
the
tranquil
quiet
of
the
place
it
seemed
to
margaret
as
they
rowed
through
the
shadows
of
the
overhanging
boughs
that
the
very
spirit
of
peace
was
brooding
over
it
all
she
almost
forgot
that
there
was
such
a
man
as
richard
de
jarnette
living
to
cast
a
shadow
over
her
path
perhaps
she
would
never
cross
it
again
they
always
took
the
same
places
in
the
boat
harcourt
rowing
margaret
in
the
bow
and
bess
and
philip
in
the
stern
to
steer
pennybacker
would
seldom
go
this
left
her
to
herself
and
brought
harcourt
face
to
face
with
bess
the
girl
was
wonderfully
pretty
with
the
freshness
of
a
swaying
anemone
but
he
used
to
wonder
sometimes
why
margaret
never
steered
now
as
she
did
at
first
there
was
a
woman
reason
perhaps
rather
a
woman
intuition
back
of
it
she
and
he
had
been
sitting
one
evening
on
the
sands
watching
the
sun
go
down
while
bess
and
philip
wandered
up
the
beach
looking
for
lucky
stones
it
was
a
gorgeous
sunset
such
an
orgy
of
color
as
flamed
in
the
sky
befitted
the
ceremonious
passing
of
a
king
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
pigments
nature
palette
held
had
been
laid
upon
the
canvas
and
endowed
with
life
were
there
struggling
for
mastery
even
to
the
zenith
and
beyond
the
heavens
were
aglow
nor
was
it
all
overhead
a
band
of
gold
stretched
across
the
broad
expanse
from
the
sun
disk
to
the
lapping
waves
at
their
feet
and
on
each
side
the
shimmering
opalescent
waters
reflected
back
the
changing
tints
above
the
little
fruit
boat
on
its
daily
trip
back
from
glen
pier
was
crossing
the
golden
shaft
now
and
its
smoke
line
stood
out
against
the
yellow
sky
it
gave
the
needed
touch
of
life
to
complete
the
picture
they
sat
in
silence
it
was
not
a
time
for
words
margaret
susceptible
to
the
influence
of
color
as
many
persons
are
to
that
of
music
was
watching
it
with
a
joy
that
was
almost
pain
as
they
looked
the
yellow
tints
merged
into
the
blue
of
the
robin
egg
pinks
melted
into
lilacs
and
the
high
lights
paled
oh
let
us
go
she
said
let
us
go
before
it
fades
i
want
to
carry
it
with
me
forever
i
can
not
see
it
put
on
the
dust
and
ashes
of
defeat
it
always
makes
me
think
then
of
a
life
from
which
the
coloring
has
gone
out
he
caught
her
by
the
hand
he
too
was
stirred
to
the
depths
margaret
do
go
there
was
a
note
in
his
voice
that
she
had
never
heard
there
before
that
it
hurt
her
to
hear
now
it
is
not
always
over
when
the
sun
goes
down
sometimes
the
later
glory
is
beyond
that
of
the
first
wait
wait
for
the
after
glow
she
drew
her
hand
away
saying
quickly
i
must
go
to
philip
he
did
not
try
to
detain
her
nor
did
she
see
him
again
till
the
next
morning
when
he
was
in
his
usual
mood
of
hilarity
in
thinking
about
it
afterwards
she
felt
sure
that
he
had
had
no
thought
of
anything
but
the
sunset
no
thought
of
what
she
had
said
about
gray
lives
but
still
the
next
day
when
they
took
their
places
in
the
boat
she
had
stepped
into
the
bow
leaving
the
steering
to
bess
who
made
a
pretty
picture
with
philip
beside
her
grasping
with
both
chubby
hands
the
steering
rope
as
children
hold
the
lines
he
felt
that
it
was
his
right
to
steer
for
he
had
now
donned
masculine
attire
thanks
to
pennybacker
divested
of
his
restraining
garments
he
was
having
a
blissful
time
these
days
with
his
mud
turtles
down
at
donahue
dock
his
mother
watching
him
or
over
at
the
station
his
hand
held
close
in
hers
never
for
one
moment
was
he
out
of
her
sight
she
was
growing
to
love
the
place
as
much
as
philip
did
from
her
seat
in
the
bow
her
eyes
resting
upon
the
child
and
the
pleasant
healthful
nonsense
of
the
young
people
falling
lightly
on
her
ears
margaret
was
beginning
to
put
the
past
behind
her
and
to
live
in
the
present
perhaps
it
was
the
conviction
growing
stronger
as
the
weeks
went
by
that
they
had
eluded
smeltzer
perhaps
that
the
needed
companionship
of
youth
was
working
a
cure
or
it
may
have
been
only
that
here
she
was
so
close
to
nature
as
to
hold
communion
with
her
visible
forms
and
that
gradually
the
old
mother
had
glided
into
her
darker
musings
with
a
mild
and
healing
sympathy
that
stole
away
their
sharpness
ere
she
was
aware
one
day
they
had
gone
up
to
cold
spring
in
the
phylidy
as
the
captain
called
his
launch
with
the
intention
of
going
on
up
the
north
branch
pennybacker
was
with
them
this
time
they
were
out
for
an
all
jaunt
and
were
to
have
dinner
in
the
woods
they
secured
a
large
boat
at
cold
spring
piled
their
hampers
and
hammocks
in
and
started
off
in
high
spirits
trenchant
comments
on
all
they
encountered
making
fun
for
the
company
margaret
from
her
post
in
the
bow
looked
back
upon
the
track
they
made
as
they
turned
into
the
north
branch
the
place
stood
out
ever
afterward
in
her
memory
the
lily
pads
at
the
river
fork
and
the
towering
elms
on
the
south
shore
in
the
distance
the
sloping
grounds
of
the
hotel
they
had
left
behind
with
the
drooping
willow
over
the
spring
just
before
her
as
she
looked
back
the
railroad
bridge
across
the
south
branch
and
two
lovers
in
a
row
boat
gliding
under
it
into
the
shadows
beyond
it
was
such
a
tranquil
scene
it
took
her
out
into
the
clear
sunlight
it
stood
out
in
john
harcourt
memory
too
for
it
was
just
here
that
she
had
said
only
two
days
before
when
he
had
taken
her
alone
for
a
row
some
day
you
will
find
a
sweet
woodland
flower
that
has
never
been
trampled
on
plant
it
in
your
garden
and
then
tend
it
oh
tend
it
carefully
it
will
not
need
much
to
make
it
grow
only
the
sunshine
and
a
little
care
a
little
tender
handling
a
little
shielding
from
the
blast
or
from
the
heat
no
it
will
not
take
much
only
let
it
be
constant
it
is
neglect
that
kills
a
plant
the
doing
for
it
and
forgetting
it
it
was
as
near
as
she
had
ever
come
to
a
confidence
about
her
own
married
life
one
winds
about
and
in
and
out
on
the
north
branch
there
are
many
many
turns
particularly
as
one
gets
farther
up
they
were
rounding
one
of
these
points
when
margaret
still
looking
back
over
their
tortuous
track
saw
a
boat
in
the
distance
it
was
only
for
a
moment
and
then
another
bend
took
it
from
view
in
it
were
two
men
she
could
not
help
feeling
disturbed
though
she
said
nothing
she
would
not
be
constantly
obtruding
her
specter
upon
others
but
she
found
herself
watching
for
the
boat
at
every
turn
sometimes
she
could
see
only
a
white
hat
against
the
green
of
the
bank
they
rowed
on
and
on
they
were
going
to
the
head
of
navigation
harcourt
said
and
there
was
all
day
to
do
it
in
all
the
pay
he
claimed
was
his
dinner
but
by
the
time
he
got
this
floating
scow
of
old
virginny
to
a
landing
place
he
rather
thought
he
should
need
it
and
he
rested
on
his
oars
harcourt
said
margaret
in
a
low
tone
have
you
noticed
those
men
in
the
boat
i
mean
they
stopped
now
they
always
slow
up
when
you
do
the
shadow
was
upon
her
again
i
noticed
them
he
replied
quietly
they
are
probably
coming
up
here
to
fish
they
say
there
are
bass
in
the
north
branch
but
he
took
up
his
oars
they
landed
at
last
and
climbed
up
the
bank
the
ladies
going
toward
the
woods
to
find
a
place
for
hammocks
and
the
dinner
for
which
philip
was
clamoring
harcourt
stayed
behind
to
make
his
scow
fast
he
had
hardly
done
so
when
the
other
boat
pulled
around
the
bend
and
drew
up
beside
him
there
were
two
men
in
it
one
was
the
keeper
the
other
smeltzer
hello
smeltzer
was
harcourt
greeting
as
the
other
sprang
out
of
the
boat
and
stood
confronting
him
he
spoke
with
a
jaunty
good
fellowship
that
he
was
far
from
feeling
the
women
were
out
of
sight
but
his
strained
ear
could
detect
sounds
coming
from
their
direction
he
knew
that
philip
was
likely
to
appear
at
any
moment
on
the
bank
above
them
you
after
bass
too
he
rather
ostentatiously
displayed
his
fishing
tackle
smeltzer
came
directly
to
the
point
no
sir
i
not
after
bass
unless
you
might
call
it
calico
bass
i
after
the
woman
you
been
spiriting
around
the
country
i
guess
she
not
give
me
the
slip
this
time
my
good
man
said
harcourt
a
little
haughtily
i
think
you
are
suffering
under
a
misapprehension
we
are
innocent
tourists
out
for
a
picnic
you
get
your
picnic
all
right
before
you
get
through
but
you
may
not
be
able
to
run
it
to
suit
you
where
is
she
you
may
as
well
stand
aside
now
harcourt
i
mean
business
at
this
moment
the
thing
that
harcourt
had
been
fearing
happened
philip
appeared
on
the
bank
just
beyond
them
harcourt
motioned
him
back
with
a
quick
gesture
but
in
the
meantime
smeltzer
had
sprung
nimbly
up
the
bank
and
was
close
behind
the
frightened
child
harcourt
and
the
man
who
had
done
the
rowing
followed
when
they
reached
the
spot
that
had
been
selected
for
the
picnic
the
women
were
huddled
together
and
margaret
had
philip
in
her
arms
smeltzer
was
explaining
his
business
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
this
party
ladies
but
i
have
an
order
here
authorizing
me
to
take
de
jarnette
and
child
into
custody
and
bring
them
to
the
city
of
washington
an
order
from
whom
demanded
margaret
from
the
guardian
of
this
child
richard
de
jarnette
you
may
go
back
to
richard
de
jarnette
and
tell
him
that
i
do
not
acknowledge
his
right
to
control
either
me
or
my
child
i
refuse
to
go
when
smeltzer
replied
to
this
it
was
in
a
tone
so
reasonable
and
conciliatory
and
withal
so
earnest
that
it
alarmed
pennybacker
more
than
bluster
would
have
done
i
hope
you
will
not
persist
in
that
decision
de
jarnette
it
will
be
far
better
for
you
in
the
end
to
go
back
peaceably
with
me
de
jarnette
has
had
men
on
the
search
for
this
child
for
nearly
five
years
you
can
depend
upon
it
that
he
will
not
give
him
up
now
that
he
is
found
but
it
may
be
that
when
you
see
him
and
talk
it
over
with
him
you
may
be
able
to
come
to
some
sort
of
a
compromise
about
it
see
here
smeltzer
said
harcourt
you
ca
bulldoze
us
in
any
such
way
as
this
you
have
the
power
to
take
de
jarnette
or
her
child
back
to
washington
on
an
order
from
any
private
individual
and
you
know
it
if
you
propose
to
arrest
her
you
have
to
show
a
warrant
for
it
is
that
right
captain
that
right
sir
replied
the
captain
who
was
an
interested
spectator
i
have
said
anything
about
arresting
her
have
i
demanded
smeltzer
i
am
trying
to
persuade
her
to
go
peaceably
without
any
such
humiliation
you
may
as
well
give
it
up
she
said
for
i
shall
never
go
i
hope
you
will
think
better
of
that
de
jarnette
because
he
was
drawing
from
his
pocket
a
yellow
envelope
marked
union
telegraph
if
you
do
it
will
force
upon
me
a
very
painful
duty
he
took
a
dispatch
from
the
envelope
and
unfolded
it
slowly
i
located
you
last
night
saw
you
first
as
you
and
the
child
were
coming
down
from
the
they
had
been
there
as
they
had
often
gone
before
to
see
the
keeper
light
the
big
lantern
the
captain
was
very
fond
of
the
child
i
followed
you
and
found
out
where
you
were
staying
then
i
wired
de
jarnette
for
instructions
here
they
are
he
handed
her
the
dispatch
and
they
gathered
around
her
to
read
it
said
bring
her
back
peaceably
if
possible
if
she
refuses
to
come
swear
out
a
warrant
for
her
arrest
on
charge
of
kidnapping
de
jarnette
you
see
said
the
man
quietly
i
am
given
no
discretion
in
the
matter
if
you
refuse
to
go
with
me
i
swear
out
this
warrant
and
then
then
what
asked
margaret
with
white
lips
when
once
this
prosecution
is
begun
even
de
jarnette
can
not
stop
it
it
will
then
be
out
of
his
hands
and
the
law
will
have
to
take
its
course
margaret
drew
a
quick
sharp
breath
if
i
could
only
talk
with
judge
kirtley
why
ca
you
telegraph
him
suggested
pennybacker
then
turning
to
the
detective
you
would
of
course
allow
her
to
do
that
certainly
i
will
wait
any
reasonable
length
of
time
or
do
anything
you
suggest
that
will
further
the
peaceful
settlement
of
this
case
in
the
meantime
i
shall
have
to
keep
her
in
sight
as
they
were
preparing
to
take
to
the
boats
the
captain
came
up
to
margaret
i
just
want
to
say
to
you
madam
he
said
wrathfully
that
if
i
had
known
what
that
cuss
was
up
to
he
he
would
have
got
to
row
him
then
raising
his
voice
a
little
to
insure
its
carrying
as
far
as
the
detective
i
lost
a
leg
madam
fighting
men
but
i
never
got
down
yet
to
hunting
women
and
children
oh
captain
i
know
you
would
have
done
anything
to
harm
him
if
you
had
known
you
have
always
been
so
good
to
philip
mama
said
philip
anxiously
as
they
packed
the
baskets
for
their
return
ca
we
eat
the
picnic
on
the
way
home
it
was
a
sad
and
thoughtful
little
party
that
rowed
slowly
back
the
detective
discreetly
following
in
his
own
boat
for
margaret
at
the
first
appearance
of
smeltzer
there
had
been
a
moment
of
absolute
terror
that
had
now
given
place
to
dull
despondency
and
the
anguish
in
her
eyes
was
piteous
to
see
pennybacker
from
the
first
counseled
returning
to
washington
with
smeltzer
if
that
man
has
been
hunting
you
for
four
years
and
a
half
he
will
not
give
the
thing
up
now
that
you
are
found
the
detective
is
undoubtedly
right
about
that
but
it
may
be
as
he
says
that
you
can
make
terms
with
de
jarnette
when
you
see
him
oh
i
ca
i
know
i
ca
said
margaret
there
is
no
telling
where
a
determined
man
will
stop
harcourt
said
and
smeltzer
is
not
going
to
lose
you
again
then
they
fell
to
wording
the
telegram
when
the
party
reached
donohue
dock
smeltzer
followed
them
at
a
respectful
distance
up
the
street
to
the
oakland
you
will
excuse
my
going
with
you
to
your
he
said
to
harcourt
who
dropped
behind
to
ask
him
some
question
i
stayed
there
last
night
you
did
yes
sir
i
did
you
would
suppose
i
would
risk
another
detour
slip
would
you
say
i
want
to
find
out
some
time
how
you
found
us
all
right
after
we
get
up
to
the
oakland
i
tell
you
it
was
several
hours
after
the
telegram
was
sent
to
judge
kirtley
before
his
answer
was
received
much
of
the
time
was
spent
in
earnest
consultation
in
miss
crosby
little
parlor
and
a
part
of
it
by
margaret
in
throes
of
anguish
upstairs
as
she
made
plan
after
plan
only
to
be
brought
up
always
at
the
last
by
the
impossibility
of
eluding
smeltzer
a
poignant
recollection
of
mammy
cely
beating
her
head
a
stone
wall
rose
before
her
that
was
what
she
was
doing
whichever
way
she
turned
there
was
the
stone
wall
what
must
she
do
what
could
she
do
nothing
she
was
powerless
richard
de
jarnette
had
run
her
to
earth
at
last
she
clenched
her
hands
in
impotent
rage
until
the
nails
sank
into
the
delicate
flesh
if
she
goes
john
harcourt
was
saying
to
pennybacker
downstairs
i
shall
go
with
her
bess
looked
startled
it
is
time
i
am
getting
back
anyway
oh
yes
i
hope
she
will
consent
to
go
it
would
do
for
her
to
risk
prosecution
on
a
criminal
charge
at
the
hands
of
a
man
like
that
that
is
exactly
the
way
i
feel
about
it
i
think
i
will
go
up
and
talk
with
her
again
harcourt
sauntered
out
doors
to
where
smeltzer
quietly
stood
on
guard
now
then
he
said
i
ca
say
that
this
affair
redounds
much
to
my
glory
smeltzer
began
half
quizzically
except
that
i
got
her
but
the
thing
that
i
do
understand
is
why
if
you
were
going
to
find
us
at
all
you
did
do
it
sooner
the
old
lady
threw
me
off
the
track
that
why
but
we
may
as
well
begin
at
the
beginning
i
had
never
connected
you
with
my
game
till
i
saw
you
here
i
suppose
now
you
are
the
one
that
got
her
off
at
detour
you
do
me
too
much
honor
smeltzer
my
will
was
good
but
my
wits
were
lacking
you
may
lay
that
to
the
charge
of
miss
norah
brannigan
of
the
a
aha
i
mistrusted
that
she
had
a
hand
in
it
anyway
but
ca
she
lie
he
seemed
lost
in
admiration
of
norah
talents
go
on
with
your
tale
we
can
all
lie
when
occasion
calls
for
it
you
are
not
an
infant
at
it
yourself
well
grinned
smeltzer
i
found
at
the
soo
that
the
lady
had
given
me
the
slip
i
went
through
that
boat
from
top
to
bottom
the
stewardess
giving
me
all
the
help
in
her
power
and
assuring
me
she
had
seen
any
such
people
on
board
then
i
made
for
the
depot
i
saw
you
you
made
good
time
smeltzer
yes
well
when
i
found
the
train
gone
i
sat
down
and
figured
it
out
she
had
a
good
long
start
but
i
knew
she
could
leave
the
island
till
morning
and
i
would
take
the
first
train
down
myself
i
telegraphed
the
ticket
agents
of
the
and
and
the
at
petoskey
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
these
parties
description
following
and
note
their
destination
the
man
identified
them
all
right
and
said
he
sold
them
tickets
for
chicago
i
took
the
next
train
for
that
blooming
metropolis
telegraphing
ahead
for
another
man
to
be
there
when
they
got
off
and
hold
them
well
sir
when
i
reached
chicago
and
heard
report
no
such
parties
had
got
off
well
sir
i
fooled
away
a
day
or
two
in
chicago
then
all
at
once
it
came
to
me
that
we
had
crossed
a
railroad
away
back
there
somewhere
and
i
could
get
it
out
of
my
mind
you
know
men
in
my
business
get
into
the
habit
of
noticing
pretty
closely
i
observed
it
i
made
some
inquiries
and
went
back
to
grand
junction
agent
remembered
the
parties
perfectly
had
had
a
good
deal
of
talk
with
the
old
lady
about
roads
out
of
kalamazoo
had
to
show
to
her
on
the
map
yes
she
from
missouri
i
took
the
next
train
for
kalamazoo
perfectly
dead
sure
i
was
on
their
track
i
monkeyed
around
there
one
week
nice
place
but
i
tell
you
i
did
enjoy
it
i
got
a
lot
of
clues
there
from
hackmen
and
gatemen
that
were
sure
they
had
seen
these
people
but
a
pile
of
good
they
did
me
you
see
i
was
so
sure
they
were
in
kalamazoo
that
i
made
that
sort
of
headquarters
and
when
i
had
exhausted
one
lead
would
go
back
there
to
take
up
another
well
finally
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
go
back
over
this
little
south
haven
road
and
take
the
boat
for
chicago
i
got
here
about
four
yesterday
and
while
idling
away
the
time
at
the
station
before
the
boat
left
who
should
i
see
across
the
river
but
the
woman
and
child
i
had
been
scouring
the
country
for
fool
luck
said
harcourt
nothing
short
of
it
i
wonder
if
that
the
way
a
lot
of
you
fellows
rise
to
eminence
in
your
profession
say
do
you
think
she
is
going
back
without
that
warrant
ca
tell
i
hope
so
i
think
it
will
depend
somewhat
on
the
telegram
and
there
it
comes
now
pennybacker
was
at
the
door
to
receive
it
she
had
been
watching
for
it
behind
the
curtains
and
called
to
margaret
that
it
had
come
they
read
it
on
the
porch
smeltzer
with
a
delicacy
that
they
hardly
expected
from
him
had
turned
his
back
upon
them
and
appeared
absorbed
in
the
view
of
the
lake
the
telegram
ran
come
peaceably
by
all
means
will
try
to
arrange
matters
kirtley
tell
him
i
will
go
said
margaret
in
a
voice
of
despair
she
had
promised
pennybacker
that
the
telegram
should
decide
it
harcourt
returned
in
a
moment
to
say
that
smeltzer
would
be
glad
to
go
by
the
late
afternoon
train
if
they
could
be
ready
said
pennybacker
reflectively
that
wo
give
us
much
time
bess
can
you
be
ready
i
told
you
not
to
unpack
all
those
things
are
we
going
too
cried
bess
in
ecstasy
to
washington
then
catching
the
child
face
between
her
hands
and
giving
a
swift
sidelong
glance
beyond
oh
philip
second
son
of
margaret
wo
that
be
fine
she
punctuated
the
sentence
upon
the
rosy
lips
but
philip
brushed
the
marks
aside
considering
such
demonstration
decidedly
beneath
a
boy
aunt
mary
to
the
mute
questioning
of
margaret
sorrowful
face
pennybacker
replied
by
taking
the
girl
into
her
motherly
arms
and
saying
with
an
odd
mixture
of
scripture
phraseology
and
pennybacker
pluck
yes
child
it
is
thou
goest
i
will
go
from
this
time
on
if
you
want
me
i
going
to
see
this
thing
through
people
shall
be
my
people
and
thy
god
my
god
i
have
no
god
cried
margaret
passionately
then
fell
to
weeping
on
her
old
friend
neck
chapter
xxii
at
bay
unfortunately
matters
were
not
so
easily
arranged
in
washington
as
judge
kirtley
had
intimated
in
his
telegram
they
might
be
after
learning
of
the
situation
pennybacker
had
a
strong
suspicion
that
the
dispatch
was
intentionally
optimistic
nor
was
she
far
wrong
judge
kirtley
was
convinced
from
his
knowledge
of
de
jarnette
that
his
object
was
not
to
bring
punishment
upon
his
but
to
get
the
child
he
was
equally
convinced
however
that
when
de
jarnette
found
her
blocking
the
way
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
she
would
be
swept
aside
regardless
of
the
consequences
to
herself
he
was
therefore
exceedingly
anxious
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
her
forcing
his
hand
it
was
found
when
the
party
reached
washington
that
richard
de
jarnette
was
inexorable
and
as
judge
kirtley
explained
to
margaret
the
child
was
now
of
such
age
that
his
guardian
could
reasonably
claim
to
be
able
to
care
for
him
as
he
could
not
have
done
for
an
infant
the
situation
was
grave
they
had
gone
directly
to
the
massachusetts
avenue
house
which
had
been
closed
since
margaret
flight
except
for
the
periodical
visits
of
a
caretaker
it
had
been
kirtley
task
to
see
that
it
was
ready
for
the
sorrowful
no
i
am
not
going
to
maria
pennybacker
had
told
bess
margaret
needs
us
and
besides
maria
always
rubs
my
fur
the
wrong
way
and
just
now
i
want
it
to
lie
straight
several
days
elapsed
after
their
return
before
margaret
saw
anything
of
richard
de
jarnette
when
she
did
he
came
to
make
a
formal
demand
for
the
child
she
refused
absolutely
to
give
him
up
in
thinking
of
that
interview
when
he
was
gone
she
felt
depressingly
aware
that
she
had
done
her
cause
no
good
for
she
had
said
many
bitter
intemperate
things
being
under
great
provocation
to
them
all
he
listened
without
reply
until
she
had
spent
herself
then
he
said
my
dead
brother
will
gave
me
this
child
i
accept
it
as
a
sacred
trust
the
courts
have
sustained
that
will
and
my
claim
i
shall
have
the
child
i
beg
that
you
will
not
deceive
yourself
nor
let
any
one
else
deceive
you
into
thinking
that
my
determination
is
subject
to
change
you
will
never
get
him
she
said
unless
you
tear
him
by
force
from
my
arms
he
bowed
gravely
then
and
left
her
the
next
day
an
officer
appeared
at
the
massachusetts
avenue
house
with
a
paper
to
serve
upon
de
jarnette
habeas
corpus
proceedings
had
been
instituted
in
the
district
supreme
court
by
richard
de
jarnette
to
recover
the
custody
of
his
ward
philip
varnum
de
jarnette
margaret
varnum
de
jarnette
the
mother
of
the
child
was
named
as
respondent
in
the
suit
the
paper
was
an
order
duly
signed
requiring
the
respondent
to
show
cause
october
twelfth
at
why
writ
of
habeas
corpus
should
not
be
issued
october
twelfth
was
one
week
away
the
was
crowded
to
its
utmost
capacity
when
the
de
jarnette
case
was
called
a
contest
for
the
custody
of
a
child
rarely
fails
to
excite
interest
and
in
this
case
it
was
greatly
enhanced
by
the
social
position
and
financial
standing
of
the
litigants
besides
this
the
case
had
attracted
much
attention
because
of
the
legal
points
involved
the
daily
papers
had
done
their
best
to
prepare
the
public
for
this
trial
the
account
of
the
finding
of
the
child
after
years
of
search
had
been
given
in
full
with
one
notable
exception
from
the
smeltzer
point
of
view
the
details
of
the
sensational
will
case
were
revived
and
the
kidnapping
by
the
mother
on
the
night
following
the
decision
which
awarded
her
child
to
the
guardian
under
the
will
the
accident
by
which
victor
de
jarnette
lost
his
life
was
recalled
and
related
with
much
circumstantiality
and
some
enlargement
it
was
all
discussed
in
many
a
household
in
washington
during
the
week
preceding
the
trial
and
it
brought
to
the
a
good
attendance
that
day
women
were
there
in
unusual
numbers
drawn
thither
by
their
sympathies
as
well
as
their
curiosity
john
harcourt
looking
back
of
him
thought
he
had
never
seen
so
many
there
before
margaret
accompanied
by
pennybacker
bess
and
kirtley
sat
beside
the
old
judge
de
jarnette
by
his
counsel
this
by
a
chance
brought
the
two
who
were
fighting
for
the
child
side
by
side
while
philip
in
childish
ignorance
of
what
it
all
meant
sat
between
them
of
course
nothing
had
been
said
to
him
about
the
case
and
the
arguments
of
counsel
threw
no
enlightenment
upon
the
matter
to
him
but
there
was
one
book
that
philip
had
learned
to
read
if
he
did
not
know
anything
about
the
weighty
volumes
they
were
quoting
from
and
that
was
his
mother
face
he
saw
from
it
now
that
something
was
wrong
and
climbing
up
into
her
lap
he
took
her
cheeks
between
his
chubby
hands
and
kissed
her
gravely
on
lips
and
eyes
then
satisfied
at
the
faint
smile
his
caress
evoked
he
slid
down
to
the
floor
placed
his
chair
close
to
hers
and
laid
his
head
against
her
shoulder
the
little
byplay
was
not
lost
on
those
in
the
vicinity
and
the
clerk
looking
up
just
then
wondered
what
it
could
be
that
he
had
lost
the
women
spectators
and
some
of
the
men
were
wiping
their
eyes
there
had
been
a
fearful
strain
upon
margaret
in
these
last
few
days
the
journey
the
suspense
the
fear
of
how
it
would
terminate
were
almost
more
than
she
could
stand
up
against
she
had
a
strange
sudden
sense
of
unreality
she
looked
around
to
see
if
it
were
really
she
then
by
one
of
those
quick
reversions
that
the
mind
sometimes
makes
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
in
precisely
this
place
once
before
not
in
that
other
trial
but
in
one
just
like
this
that
pennybacker
sat
beside
her
then
as
now
that
philip
leaned
against
her
thus
and
that
a
man
was
saying
this
identical
thing
she
looked
around
at
the
court
officers
half
dazed
as
the
trial
proceeded
she
lost
hope
de
jarnette
attorney
was
making
out
such
a
clear
case
but
when
judge
kirtley
spoke
it
did
not
seem
that
there
was
room
for
doubt
as
to
how
it
would
go
she
get
the
child
he
closed
with
a
powerful
plea
for
a
mother
supreme
right
after
the
closing
of
the
arguments
the
judge
spoke
the
question
to
be
determined
he
said
is
not
one
of
sentiment
but
of
law
briefly
stated
it
is
this
whether
the
statute
of
charles
ii
chapter
section
is
in
force
in
this
district
to
the
extent
that
the
father
of
infant
children
may
be
deed
or
will
transfer
their
exclusive
custody
and
control
to
a
guardian
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
mother
his
wife
may
be
competent
willing
and
in
all
respects
qualified
to
maintain
educate
and
train
them
properly
there
has
been
both
in
and
out
of
court
a
good
deal
of
sentimental
declamation
indulged
in
in
regard
to
this
statute
and
it
has
been
reprobated
as
being
in
conflict
with
the
natural
rights
of
the
mother
and
in
conflict
with
the
present
civilization
of
the
people
but
while
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
courts
of
justice
and
especially
of
common
law
are
not
at
liberty
to
disregard
the
statute
and
act
upon
any
mere
feeling
of
repugnance
to
it
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
this
statute
of
charles
ii
has
been
in
force
in
england
for
more
than
two
centuries
and
that
it
is
still
in
force
there
and
has
stood
the
test
of
english
civilization
with
the
slight
modification
he
went
on
to
explain
that
the
chancellor
or
master
of
the
rolls
may
upon
petition
of
the
mother
where
the
infant
is
within
the
age
of
seven
years
order
that
such
infant
shall
be
delivered
to
and
remain
in
the
custody
of
the
mother
until
attaining
the
age
of
seven
provided
the
mother
be
a
fit
and
proper
person
to
have
the
custody
of
the
infant
there
may
be
reasons
he
continued
why
the
wife
should
not
be
selected
as
the
guardian
of
the
child
in
the
first
place
the
father
as
the
head
of
the
family
and
the
responsible
one
has
the
right
to
say
who
should
have
the
training
of
his
children
pennybacker
eyes
snapped
who
gave
him
that
right
she
asked
in
a
fierce
whisper
of
bess
who
was
the
nearest
at
hand
but
bess
not
knowing
the
answer
could
only
look
blank
the
judge
went
on
to
say
that
another
reason
was
the
probability
of
a
second
marriage
and
the
consequent
introduction
of
his
child
to
the
treatment
of
a
stranger
possibly
hard
and
unsympathetic
of
course
seldom
marry
commented
pennybacker
satirically
and
yet
another
reason
might
be
in
the
age
or
ill
health
to
say
nothing
of
the
mental
or
moral
unfitness
of
the
mother
he
proceeded
to
emphasize
just
here
that
while
no
stress
had
been
laid
upon
the
unfitness
in
the
present
case
on
account
of
mental
or
moral
incompetency
it
had
been
clearly
shown
by
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
that
she
was
guilty
of
wilfully
and
forcibly
kidnapping
and
abducting
said
child
after
the
will
devising
it
to
the
said
de
jarnette
had
been
admitted
to
probate
and
while
it
might
be
argued
that
this
was
an
unwitting
violation
of
the
law
still
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
act
showed
the
defendant
to
be
deficient
in
that
sound
judgment
which
would
make
her
a
safe
guardian
for
the
child
margaret
sat
looking
at
him
with
wild
startled
eyes
like
all
powers
of
appointment
he
continued
this
power
in
the
father
to
appoint
by
testament
a
guardian
to
his
children
is
liable
sometimes
to
be
exercised
in
what
might
appear
to
be
an
arbitrary
manner
and
in
disregard
of
the
feelings
of
the
mother
but
the
history
of
the
statute
does
not
show
this
to
have
been
frequently
the
case
in
reality
many
times
the
act
has
a
most
beneficent
operation
the
principle
of
the
statute
taking
it
all
in
all
appears
to
have
been
beneficial
to
the
family
relation
and
to
have
furnished
the
means
of
securing
the
welfare
of
the
children
which
after
all
is
the
thing
that
the
court
has
always
to
consider
if
not
so
it
could
hardly
have
been
retained
in
force
in
the
english
and
american
statute
law
to
the
present
day
concluding
he
said
in
this
subject
was
fully
discussed
before
the
court
of
bench
it
was
held
that
a
person
who
had
been
duly
appointed
under
charles
ii
chap
sec
by
the
will
of
the
father
to
be
guardian
of
his
child
stands
in
and
having
therefore
a
legal
right
to
the
custody
of
the
infant
may
in
order
to
obtain
possession
of
such
ward
claim
a
writ
of
which
a
common
law
court
has
no
discretion
to
refuse
if
the
applicant
be
a
fit
person
and
the
child
too
young
to
choose
for
itself
the
court
therefore
gives
the
custody
of
the
child
to
the
guardian
under
the
will
and
counsel
may
draw
a
decree
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
the
court
for
a
full
half
minute
there
was
silence
in

before
judge
kirtley
could
speak
or
put
out

hand
to
stop

margaret
de
jarnette
stood
up
white
as
the
dead
the
decision
may
be
according
to
the
law
she
said
in
a
low
tense
voice
the
law
made
by
men
for
men
but
it
will
not
stand
mark
that
her
head
was
thrown
back
now
and
her
eyes
blazed
for
it
is
against
nature
law
and
that
is
god
very
own
this
child
is
mine
i
bore
him
through
pain
of
body
and
anguish
of
soul
does
that
give
me
no
claim
upon
him
she
stretched
out
her
hands
in
an
unconscious
gesture
of
appeal
a
silence
like
that
of
the
grave
was
over
the
room
men
and
women
bent
forward
and
held
their
breath
in
their
eagerness
to
hear
the
judge
did
not
stop
her
the
probate
court
is
very
patient
with
women
and
that
is
not
all
she
went
on
oh
no
that
is
not
all
through
all
those
weary
months
days
of
pain
and
sleepless
nights
he
lay
part
of
my
body
his
very
life
entwined
with
mine
his
very
soul
fashioned
by
mine
his
being
absolutely
dependent
upon
mine
he
lay
there
i
say
close
to
my
heart
every
throb
was
for
you
tell
me
that
the
man
who
gave
him
only
life
and
a
name
and
then
deserted
him
the
words
were
pouring
out
tumultuously
now
that
this
man
has
the
right
to
will
that
child
away
from
me
his
mother
as
he
would
his
horse
or
his
dog
i
tell
you
it
is
a
lie
lie
he
has
no
such
right
the
child
is
mine
there
is
no
power
in
earth
or
heaven
or
hell
that
can
take
him
from
me
have
him

the
world
grew
black
before
her
she
swayed
backward
there
was
a
sudden
stir
and
it
was
richard

springing
forward
that
caught
her

she
fell
chapter

mothers
and
foster
mothers
from
the
she
was
carried
straight
to
the
hospital
the
doctor
summoned
hastily
to
attend
her
told
them
gravely
that
it
was
probably
the
beginning
of
an
attack
of
brain
fever
there
was
never
any
telling
where
that
would
end
the
strain
of
the
last
week
had
been
very
severe
she
should
have
the
most
skilful
and
experienced
nursing
that
could
be
secured
and
constant
medical
attention
then
too
as
judge
kirtley
hurriedly
explained
to
pennybacker
who
having
some
confidence
in
her
own
ability
as
a
nurse
and
a
country
woman
distrust
of
hospitals
had
urged
margaret
removal
to
her
own
home
at
the
hospital
she
would
be
spared
the
further
strain
of
seeing
the
child
taken
away
it
would
be
hard
for
her
to
come
back
to
a
house
without
him
but
not
such
an
ordeal
as
his
forcible
removal
would
be
after
this
pennybacker
said
no
more
with
judge
kirtley
she
herself
had
taken
margaret
to
the
hospital
the
girl
still
mercifully
oblivious
to
all
around
her
then
she
had
returned
to
massachusetts
avenue
to
get
philip
ready
for
his
removal
to
elmhurst
life
seemed
to
be
moving
on
pretty
rapidly
just
now
when
she
reached
the
house
the
child
was
gone
de
jarnette
had
come
for
him
almost
immediately
bess
reported
did
he
object
to
going
no
i
told
him
in
de
jarnette
presence
that
his
mama
was
sick
and
he
was
going
to
his
uncle
richard
for
a
little
visit
i
guess
i
emphasized
visit
maybe
i
think
margaret
had
prepared
philip
for
it
i
heard
her
tell
him
last
night
that
perhaps
he
would
go
to
his
uncle
richard
for
a
while
and
that
he
must
be
a
brave
little
boy
and
not
cry
i
know
i
think
she
lost
courage
last
night
perhaps
she
had
a
presentiment
of
how
it
was
to
be
i
am
glad
she
took
that
way
of
preparing
the
child
did
he
cry
no
but
his
chin
quivered
the
way
it
does
you
know
when
he
tries
to
keep
from
crying
poor
little
thing
grandma
said
bess
thoughtfully
i
do
believe
de
jarnette
is
going
to
be
unkind
to
philip
he
did
say
much
but
he
seemed
to
be
looking
out
for
him
asked
if
he
had
some
favorite
playthings
that
could
be
taken
along
you
would
imagine
his
thinking
of
such
a
thing
as
that
would
you
is
he
a
strange
man
incomprehensible
to
me
what
did
you
give
him
his
train
of
cars
and
the
little
red
wagon
and
grandma
i
gave
de
jarnette
that
picture
of
margaret
and
philip
together
the
one
you
know
that
we
call
madonna
that
is
the
sweetest
thing
she
ever
had
taken
with
philip
baby
face
pressed
up
against
hers
i
told
him
it
might
help
philip
at
night
to
have
it
to
look
at
if
he
was
homesick
bess
yes
i
did
i
knew
it
would
make
him
howl
i
hope
it
will
any
way
i
thought
the
picture
would
do
de
jarnette
good
bess
said
pennybacker
in
a
burst
of
grandmotherly
admiration
which
she
did
not
always
display
so
openly
for
a
young
girl
you
certainly
have
a
great
deal
of
sense
i
hope
philip
wo
be
too
brave
i
like
to
see
richard
de
jarnette
with
a
homesick
child
on
his
hands
and
if
he
does
have
one
i
miss
my
guess
there
maria
and
that
idiotic
little
poodle
oh
dear
i
did
hope
i
should
be
spared
that
looking
from
the
window
bess
saw
van
dorn
alighting
from
her
carriage
the
footman
holding
what
looked
like
a
silky
ball
with
dashes
of
pink
about
it
he
deposited
it
carefully
in
his
mistress
waiting
arms
that
toddlekyns
announced
pennybacker
i
asked
maria
the
other
day
why
she
did
give
the
thing
a
decent
christian
dog
name
sounds
to
me
like
a
weak
attenuated
cat
toddlekyns
was
in
reality
a
very
rare
variety
of
russian
poodle
upon
which
van
dorn
was
just
now
lavishing
the
wealth
of
her
unattached
affections
pennybacker
had
found
him
on
her
return
to
the
capital
occupying
so
large
a
space
in
the
center
of
the
van
dorn
stage
that
her
sense
of
proportion
had
been
greatly
outraged
she
never
passed
him
without
wishing
to
administer
a
surreptitious
kick
that
would
send
him
into
the
wings
the
years
had
dealt
kindly
with
van
dorn
or
perhaps
it
was
that
her
emotions
had
been
of
that
flabby
kind
that
do
not
leave
their
impress
on
the
face
she
gave
herself
careful
grooming
once
when
she
discovered
an
incipient
line
about
the
corner
of
her
eye
she
straightened
it
out
with
court
plaster
over
night
not
sleeping
much
in
consequence
and
massaged
it
for
two
hours
the
next
morning
excusing
herself
from
attending
divine
service
by
saying
firmly
a
woman
first
duty
is
to
herself
i
simply
will
have
wrinkles
i
thought
i
must
come
right
over
and
hear
all
about
it
she
exclaimed
sinking
gracefully
into
an
and
lifting
toddlekyns
to
her
lap
so
the
case
went
against
her
i
heard
something
about
it
from
somerville
and
she
will
really
have
to
give
him
up
too
bad
can
i
see
her
i
suppose
she
feels
dreadfully
just
at
first
at
the
hospital
you
do
say
so
brain
fever
why
they
always
die
of
that
they
well
i
feel
very
sorry
for
her
though
i
must
say
i
sympathize
with
richard
too
on
what
account
demanded
pennybacker
oh
because
everybody
is
so
down
on
him
it
has
almost
broken
off
the
intimacy
between
him
and
semple
they
say
good
for
dr
semple
well
i
do
know
i
suppose
i
am
than
some
people
i
can
always
see
both
sides
so
can
i
when
there
are
two
sides
this
case
has
but
one
well
said
van
dorn
in
an
argumentative
tone
that
was
new
to
her
anyway
i
think
it
was
very
natural
that
richard
should
want
to
carry
out
his
brother
wishes
but
she
cast
her
eyes
down
modestly
and
toyed
with
toddlekyns
silky
ears
would
you
almost
think
he
would
to
have
somebody
to
help
him
in
bringing
this
child
up
humph
came
from
her
aunt
he
has
mammy
cely
said
bess
innocently
oh
mammy
cely
an
old
negro
yes
but
anybody
that
has
a
child
to
rear
would
feel
the
need
i
should
think
of
a
sympathizing
well
i
care
think
if
richard
de
jarnette
is
really
going
to
take
philip
he
should
look
out
for
somebody
to
be
a
mother
to
him
and
i
think
he
had
better
let
him
stay
with
the
mother
the
lord
gave
him
cried
bess
indignantly
with
a
flash
of
her
grandmother
spirit
pennybacker
contented
herself
with
looking
keenly
at
her
niece
over
her
spectacles
there
was
something
about
the
look
that
embarrassed
van
dorn
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
do
sympathize
with
margaret
aunt
mary
she
began
it
is
that
at
all
i
feel
awfully
sorry
for
her
i
know
she
will
feel
lonely
at
first
i
thought
about
it
at
home
how
lonely
i
should
be
if
i
should
lose
toddlekyns
and
i
just
made
up
my
mind
to
let
her
have
him
for
a
few
days
till
the
worst
of
it
is
over
i
may
yet
when
she
gets
back
from
the
hospital
pennybacker
shut
her
lips
firmly
together
and
shook
her
head
i
would
do
it
maria
she
said
hastily
she
moved
over
to
the
window
and
took
up
her
knitting
leaving
van
dorn
to
bess
entertainment
it
was
hard
for
anything
to
hold
her
thoughts
long
away
from
the
child
of
her
adoption
she
had
come
back
from
the
hospital
sorely
troubled
about
her
and
was
falling
back
from
habit
upon
her
inevitable
resource
when
burdened
work
but
as
the
knitting
needles
flew
in
her
swift
fingers
her
thoughts
were
with
margaret
and
her
fight
against
fate
how
would
margaret
bear
it
now
that
the
hope
which
had
been
a
sheet
anchor
to
her
soul
was
gone
she
had
been
very
brave
through
it
all
even
in
these
last
trying
days
but
it
had
been
in
the
confident
belief
that
no
court
in
the
land
would
decree
against
her
with
that
prop
gone
upon
what
would
she
stay
her
soul
she
recalled
the
girl
passionate
outburst
in
the
with
apprehension
it
was
not
like
her
to
forget
time
and
place
and
the
proprieties
like
that
she
thought
of
the
doctor
words
you
never
can
tell
how
a
thing
like
this
will
end
knew
that
it
ended
sometimes
in
death
and
sometimes
in
pennybacker
did
not
finish
it
she
would
not
acknowledge
even
to
herself
the
fear
that
was
tugging
at
her
heart
margaret
had
been
under
a
fearful
mental
strain
would
she
be
able
to
stand
up
against
it
would
her
physical
vigor
be
such
as
to
enable
her
to
she
broke
off
again
in
her
thoughts
she
was
thinking
in
fragments
suppose
the
next
trial
of
the
case
in
whatever
form
it
would
come
should
go
against
her
too
had
she
the
strength
of
will
of
character
to
recast
her
life
still
another
time
and
live
it
out
without
her
child
she
had
been
amazed
at
the
buoyancy
of
the
girl
nature
which
had
enabled
her
to
rise
above
her
sorrows
and
thrust
them
beneath
her
feet
but
then
she
had
philip
now
aunt
mary
said
van
dorn
turning
to
her
and
breaking
in
upon
these
somber
thoughts
somewhat
abruptly
i
must
say
that
i
was
very
much
surprised
at
margaret
de
jarnette
conduct
in
the
somerville
was
telling
me
about
it
of
course
people
are
different
and
i
do
expect
everybody
to
have
my
high
standards
but
it
seems
to
me
that
her
allusions
were
decidedly
indelicate
not
to
say
coarse
somerville
says
she
was
actually
violent
i
should
call
it
anyway
she
said
or
or
some
of
those
things
that
nobody
ought
ever
to
say
but
a
man
somerville
did
seem
to
feel
so
but
i
am
surprised
at
margaret
such
bad
form
and
before
gentlemen
too
pennybacker
needles
clicked
she
was
knitting
fast
and
without
much
regard
to
stitches
dropped
those
needles
were
her
safety
valves
her
lips
just
now
indicated
that
steam
was
at
high
pressure
it
was
positively
no
use
to
talk
to
maria
of
course
it
is
hard
for
her
to
give
up
her
child
van
dorn
continued
with
the
air
of
one
willing
to
make
every
reasonable
concession
any
woman
can
understand
a
mother
feelings
come
here
darling
let
mama
tie
his
little
wibbons
but
to
say
maria
pennybacker
gave
her
yarn
a
jerk
that
sent
the
ball
on
one
of
its
perennial
journeys
across
the
room
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
it
is
not
very
becoming
in
you
to
criticise
margaret
de
jarnette
just
at
this
time
a
woman
who
has
never
been
anything
more
than

was
a

a
bride
nobody
had
ever
thought
it
worth
while
to
change
them
in
the
center
of
the
room
the
mahogany
table
was
piled
with
books
and
papers
mammy
cely
kept
the
place
beautifully
clean
but
she
was
forbidden
to
touch
the
table
the
very
books
on
the
shelves
belonged
to
another
century
the
english
poets
bound
in
sheep
hume
gibbon
johnson
dictionary
well
worn
josephus
history
of
the
reformation
and
kindred
sorts
and
on
the
lower
shelves
scott
bible
in
many
ponderous
tomes
and
the
comprehensive
commentary
on
one
shelf
in
the
secretary
were
a
few
volumes
that
spoke
a
woman
taste
at
a
time
when
women
must
not
read
the
virile
things
their
brothers
found
good
food
hemans
and
sigourney
in
blue
and
gold
a
flora
album
the
language
of
flowers
and
gift
books
and
annuals
in
resplendent
bindings
that
suggested
the
poverty
within
these
books
had
been
richard
mother
and
they
looked
cowed
and
overshadowed
by
the
masculine
array
that
lined
the
room
all
the
moneyed
de
jarnettes
had
been
planters
but
with
the
reading
habit
and
there
had
been
a
preacher
and
a
doctor
in
the
family
who
dying
without
issue
had
bequeathed
their
libraries
to
the
shelves
of
elmhurst
the
red
cover
of
the
book
that
richard
de
jarnette
held
in
his
hand
seemed
almost
an
impertinence
among
this
staid
respectable
assemblage
in
sheep
and
calf
it
looked
so
new
and
fresh
and
modern
but
while
it
was
all
this
it
was
not
holding
him
it
would
have
taken
more
even
than
dear
john
fiske
to
shut
out
from
his
ears
the
echo
of
this
day
doings
fragments
from
the
attorney
pleas
pennybacker
incisive
whisper
which
reached
his
ear
and
lodged
there
who
gave
him
that
right
he
tried
to
throw
it
all
aside
it
was
over
now
and
he
had
won
the
child
was
upstairs
safe
asleep
he
was
sick
and
tired
of
the
subject
he
would
get
his
mind
on
something
else
it
was
for
this
that
he
had
brought
out
virginia
and
her
neighbors
and
he
turned
resolutely
to
the
book
but
somehow
the
face
of
the
woman
he
had
defeated
rose
up
between
him
and
the
printed
page
he
could
not
see
the
words
for
it
for
one
brief
space
he
had
held
his
vanquished
enemy
passive
in
his
arms
her
head
against
his
breast
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
sight
of
her
face
as
she
lay
there
he
put
the
book
down
and
threw
his
head
back
against
the
chair
his
eyes
encountered
those
of
his
mother
fixed
upon
him
his
young
mother
whom
he
had
never
known
she
looked
down
upon
him
from
the
portrait
over
the
mantel
with
the
hateful
pertinacity
that
the
eyes
in
portraits
sometimes
show
they
followed
him
whichever
way
he
turned
they
were
very
sad
eyes
he
had
never
liked
to
look
at
the
portrait
on
that
account
his
mother
had
not
been
a
happy
woman
that
he
knew
from
mammy
cely
and
he
would
have
guessed
it
he
had
sometimes
thought
from
the
character
of
the
face
that
hung
beside
it
there
was
a
sternness
about
the
features
of
his
father
that
did
not
promise
much
for
a
happiness
richard
de
jarnette
was
not
an
imaginative
man
but
there
was
something
about
his
mother
eyes
that
in
all
these
years
he
had
never
seen
there
a
questioning
reproachful
look
they
had
never
followed
him
about
as
they
did
he
moved
impatiently
half
turning
away
from
the
portrait
and
took
up
his
book
again
he
read
on
resolutely
turning
page
after
page
with
regularity
he
would
not
give
up
to
such
folly
then
all
at
once
he
perceived
that
what
john
fiske
was
saying
was
in
a
voice
of
anguish
child
is
mine
i
bore
him
he
shut
the
book
he
could
not
evade
the
thing
and
after
all
what
was
there
to
evade
he
was
right
the
law
had
justified
him
in
what
he
had
done
and
the
courts
knew
less
about
the
case
than
he
did
too
that
was
another
thing
he
had
not
injured
her
reputation
in
any
way
he
had
seen
to
that
the
world
would
know
her
always
as
an
injured
wife
he
was
content
that
it
should
be
so
it
would
know
him
as
a
unnatural
monster
he
knew
that
because
a
candid
man
had
eased
an
mind
by
telling
him
so
even
semple
his
friend
his
own
familiar
friend
he
winced
now
as
one
does
when
a
bare
nerve
is
touched
had
avoided
him
as
they
left
the
only
those
who
have
few
friends
could
know
how
that
cut
well
let
the
world
think
what
it
chose
of
him
he
knew
he
was
right
he
could
have
justified
himself
before
them
all
but
it
would
have
been
at
her
expense
that
he
did
not
choose
to
do
he
had
heeded
his
dying
request
and
spared
her
victor
in
shielding
her
with
his
latest
breath
had
made
what
reparation
he
could
for
the
wrong
he
had
done
her
it
was
left
to
him
to
administer
justice
and
why
should
he
not
he
asked
himself
with
a
sudden
sense
of
bereavement
she
had
taken
from
him
his
best
beloved
he
had
done
no
more
by
her
and
he
knew
and
she
knew
why
he
had
done
it
that
was
enough
pity
no
had
she
had
pity
richard
de
jarnette
had
the
eyes
of
his
mother
but
his
mouth
as
it
tightened
now
looked
singularly
like
that
of
the
man
in
the
portrait
above
him
a
knock
broke
in
upon
his
perturbed
thoughts
and
mammy
cely
dark
face
appeared
marse
richard
well
he
was
impatient
at
the
i

strange
thing

old
child
he
said
looking
very
straight
at
her
mammy

long
as

he
tuk
right
smart
me
feed
the
chickens
and
put

hovels
but
marse
richard
when
dark
comes
it
the
nacher
of
a
child
to
want
its
mother
they
they
nachers
he
did
not
answer
her
in
his
ears
the
impassioned
cry
was
sounding
and
nature
law
is
god
very
own
in
his
perplexity
for
mammy
cely
was
persistently
though
humbly
waiting
for
instructions
richard
de
jarnette
remembered
the
picture
that
bess
had
given
him
with
a
faint
spasm
of
hope
he
took
it
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
in
the
hand
of
the
old
woman
here
show
him
this
let
him
take
it
to
bed
with
him
that
young
girl
that
came
on
with
his
mother
gave
it
to
me
she
said
it
might
help
him
if
he
was
homesick
mammy
cely
took
the
photograph
and
looked
at
it
with
interest
shaking
her
head
and
setting
her
lips
together
that
sholy
is
got
the
favor
of
miss
margaret
and
philip
too
look
at
the
little
thing
with
his
face
pressed
up
hers
what
he
wants
to
do
now
a
chile
do
want
no
mo
heaven
than
that
yes
sir
respectfully
i
reckon
that
do
him
a
heap
er
good
that
young
girl
certainly
was
thoughtful
she
was
so
there
was
the
slightest
drawing
down
of
the
corners
of
mammy
mouth
as
if
to
combat
a
tendency
they
had
to
go
up
richard
had
not
much
more
than
settled
himself
again
with
john
fiske
when
he
heard
mammy
cely
lumbering
down
the
stairs
marse
richard
well
what
do
you
want
now
his
tone
was
decidedly
irritated
i
reckon
you
have
to
come
the
picture
do
to
meet
the
case
hit
worse
an
mo
of
it
soon
as
he
seed
his
ma
face
he
busted
right
out
he
jes
howlin
now
very
reluctantly
de
jarnette
ascended
to
his
nephew
room
frightful
wails
corroborated
the
truth
of
mammy
cely
assertions
and
the
accuracy
of
her
descriptive
powers
the
sounds
stopped
abruptly
as
the
gentleman
entered
the
room
for
a
man
was
an
unknown
quantity
in
philip
experience
and
his
uncle
was
a
stranger
to
him
but
such
a
tempest
of
lamentation
can
not
be
shut
off
entirely
at
a
moment
notice
the
child
breath
came
in
convulsive
sobs
that
threatened
to
disrupt
his
little
body
what
is
the
matter
philip
asked
de
jarnette
sitting
down
by
the
bed
what
are
you
crying
about
i
i
want
my
my
my
you
ca
have
your
mama
now
she
is
here
but
i
my
mama
philip
did
you
hear
me
say
your
mama
was
not
here
de
jarnette
spoke
rather
sternly
then
with
full
confidence
in
his
reasoning
powers
he
proceeded
to
explain
that
his
mama
was
in
the
city
miles
and
miles
away
from
here
that
even
if
he
could
see
her
in
the
morning
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
it
that
if
he
was
a
good
little
boy
there
is
no
telling
what
imprudence
he
might
have
been
led
into
by
his
desire
for
peace
but
at
this
juncture
philip
who
had
been
quieted
for
a
while
by
the
strangeness
of
a
masculine
voice
broke
out
afresh
i
want
my
he
answerin
yo
argyments
the
same
way
he
did
mine
marse
richard
the
color
of
do
to
make
no
it
did
indeed
however
forcible
and
logical
was
de
line
of
reasoning
however
convincing
it
seemed
temporarily
no
sooner
was
it
ended
than
philip
with
a
child
insistent
iteration
made
reply
but
i
want
my
you
git
a
chile
in
that
frame
of
mind
moralized
mammy
cely
and
hits
reasonin
powers
is
mighty
weak
jes
as
well
try
to
argue
with
a
dose
of
ipecac
after
it
down
go
on
out
of
here
commanded
de
jarnette
pausing
in
his
strides
across
the
room
with
philip
in
his
arms
and
mammy
cely
retired
greatly
pleased
with
the
turn
affairs
were
taking
at
the
sound
of
the
closing
door
philip
broke
out
into
renewed
lamentations
his
only
friend
was
gone
philip
stop
your
crying
stop
i
say
in
his
desperation
de
jarnette
spoke
far
more
sternly
than
he
felt
philip
stopped
in
sheer
astonishment
but
his
mouth
and
chin
puckered
themselves
up
in
that
most
pitiful
of
all
things
a
child
attempts
at
self
control
i
is
been
use
to
scolding
he
said
reproachfully
i
do
want
to
scold
you
de
jarnette
hastened
to
say
for
there
were
signs
of
another
inundation
you
are
going
to
be
a
good
little
boy
now
and
is
it
bad
to
want
my
mama
asked
philip
no
but
it
is
foolish
to
keep
on
asking
for
what
you
ca
have
why
ca
i
have
my
mama
because
she
not
here
why
ai
she
here
because
she
is
at
the
hospital
what
for
she
sick
what
makes
her
sick
philip
if
you
will
go
to
sleep
now
i
will
bring
you
some
candy
in
the
morning
will
you
do
it
philip
considered
would
it
be
gum
dwops
yes
or
any
other
obtainable
variety
and
some
peanuts
too
and
popcorn
balls
i
rather
have
a
said
philip
with
interest
well
you
shall
have
a
too
and
some
ransacking
his
memory
for
childish
tastes
is
it
going
to
be
christmas
asked
his
nephew
beginning
to
feel
that
life
was
still
worth
living
yes
we
have
christmas
once
a
month
at
elmhurst
oftener
if
needed
are
you
santa
claus
asked
philip
in
an
awed
voice
i
a
friend
of
his
returned
richard
gravely
with
an
odd
sense
that
this
was
a
plagiarism
which
would
be
detected
but
there
is
nothing
like
the
trustingness
of
childhood
then
can
you
get
anything
you
want
from
santa
claus
for
little
boys
almost
anything
said
de
jarnette
cautiously
remembering
mothers
it
was
a
fruitful
vein
and
philip
worked
it
for
all
it
was
worth
when
at
last
his
eyelids
closed
over
the
bright
eyes
and
the
curly
head
lay
still
against
his
uncle
breast
santa
claus
friend
stood
committed
to
a
bushel
of
candy
a
bag
of
peanuts
some
pink
lemonade
a
balloon
showing
the
connection
of
ideas
a
dog
two
white
rabbits
a
sure
enough
engine
and
a
billy
goat
he
considered
peace
cheaply
purchased
at
that
he
would
have
impoverished
the
exchequer
rather
than
have
had
another
two
hours
of
conflict
is
he
likely
to
keep
this
up
long
he
asked
mammy
cely
whom
he
met
in
the
hall
just
as
he
had
laid
his
young
nephew
on
his
bed
and
from
the
room
he
wiped
his
brow
nervously
lord
marse
richard
sometimes
a
homesick
chile
will
carry
on
this
way
for
a
month
yes
sir
they
will
so
the
drops
broke
out
on
richard
forehead
he
wo
be
apt
to
have
a
return
of
it
will
he
you
ca
never
tell
said
mammy
cruelly
he
may
have
another
spell
inside
of
an
hour
ef
he
does
i
call
you
seems
lak
you
can
pacify
him
a
heap
better
than
what
i
can
yes
sir
chapter
xxv
the
madonna
picture
the
master
of
elmhurst
returned
to
it
the
next
night
loaded
down
he
might
have
passed
for
a
gentleman
delivering
his
own
groceries
in
the
toy
store
with
a
shuddering
recollection
of
what
it
was
to
be
void
of
material
from
which
to
fashion
a
bribe
he
had
made
purchases
right
and
left
one
would
have
thought
that
judiciously
doled
out
they
might
be
made
to
spread
out
over
the
month
of
weeping
that
mammy
cely
had
darkly
hinted
at
philip
had
not
waked
when
he
left
home
that
morning
and
there
had
been
no
opportunity
to
see
how
far
a
night
in
his
new
domicile
had
succeeded
in
reconciling
him
to
it
de
jarnette
had
what
he
himself
felt
was
an
almost
unreasonable
anxiety
about
it
before
he
came
to
live
with
him
the
personality
of
this
child
seemed
a
thing
of
no
moment
whatever
now
it
assumed
gigantic
proportions
what
if
philip
did
not
like
the
things
he
had
bought
for
him
what
if
he
refused
to
be
bought
by
them
he
shuddered
as
he
thought
of
last
night
and
the
possibility
of
its
duplication
before
leaving
home
that
morning
he
had
informed
his
housekeeper
that
he
had
shut
up
the
town
house
for
the
present
and
would
come
out
every
night
moreover
he
had
directed
that
philip
should
have
his
dinner
with
him
that
this
was
a
sacrifice
was
certainly
true
but
it
was
one
that
his
conscience
demanded
unsuspected
in
the
depths
of
richard
de
jarnette
nature
was
an
active
volcano
never
sending
up
fire
and
smoke
that
could
be
seen
of
men
but
keeping
up
a
low
rumbling
a
good
deal
of
the
time
it
was
this
that
had
brought
him
to
live
at
his
country
home
at
a
time
when
he
specially
desired
to
absent
himself
from
it
it
had
issued
the
fiat
that
he
must
forego
his
quiet
evening
meal
and
make
himself
a
martyr
to
a
child
presence
he
thought
of
it
with
anything
but
pleasure
but
so
ominous
was
the
rumbling
within
that
though
he
could
have
avoided
it
all
by
a
word
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
say
the
word
he
had
forcibly
taken
this
child
into
his
own
life
he
could
not
evade
the
responsibility
that
came
with
the
act
and
yet
richard
de
jarnette
was
considered
a
hard
man
the
dinner
proved
less
of
an
ordeal
than
he
had
expected
indeed
after
the
first
embarrassment
of
that
strange
small
presence
it
really
was
rather
interesting
he
was
so
unused
to
children
that
his
small
observations
seemed
rather
remarkable
he
did
not
know
that
the
only
way
a
child
learns
language
is
to
experiment
in
its
use
philip
was
a
child
with
a
natural
sense
of
propriety
having
been
reared
with
grown
people
he
had
a
somewhat
startling
use
of
words
but
for
the
same
reason
he
was
entirely
without
a
trace
of
pertness
he
had
been
accustomed
to
meeting
older
people
on
equal
terms
he
was
secretly
rather
ashamed
of
his
childishness
of
the
night
before
as
he
explained
to
mammy
cely
it
had
been
because
he
could
not
help
it
seated
at
the
table
with
freshly
brushed
locks
and
all
traces
of
tears
gone
he
looked
quite
the
little
gentleman
mammy
cely
had
cautioned
him
not
to
talk
too
much
but
philip
knew
enough
to
hold
up
his
end
of
the
conversation
well
philip
how
have
you
and
mammy
cely
got
along
pretty
well
said
philip
cheerfully
what
have
you
been
doing
to
amuse
yourself
philip
considered
he
had
done
a
great
many
things
for
mammy
cely
had
taken
a
day
off
to
amuse
and
entertain
him
i
ca
explain
it
he
said
at
length
i
forgot
the
number
what
he
meant
richard
never
knew
and
it
is
quite
likely
that
philip
had
no
very
definite
idea
himself
later
he
remembered
about
putting
the
chickens
in
the
hovels
which
he
related
with
animation
after
a
pause
he
asked
politely
do
you
have
any
turkles
around
here
turkeys
suggested
his
uncle
no
sir
turkles
we
had
a
gweat
many
in
sous
haven
i
had
four
only
got
away
and
lily
got
did
you
name
your
turtles
yes
sir
what
were
their
names
de
jarnette
was
surprised
at
his
interest
in
carrying
on
this
conversation
rose
and
lily
and
and
alcohol
said
philip
richard
gave
a
sudden
cough
is
that
rather
a
remarkable
combination
he
asked
gravely
i
think
alcohol
is
a
good
name
for
a
turkle
said
philip
positively
it
such
a
long
name
and
turkles
are
round
what
did
you
say
happened
to
lily
why
once
i
took
my
turkles
upstair
in
a
cup
so
i
would
have
them
as
soon
as
i
got
up
and
they
got
out
and
was
promenadin
around
and
in
the
morning
mama
did
see
and
she
stepped
on
lily
and
she
then
with
a
spasm
of
reminiscence
mama
do
turkles
when
richard
de
jarnette
went
into
his
library
that
night
it
was
with
a
strange
feeling
of
the
freshness
of
life
he
had
been
walking
up
and
down
the
garden
walks
for
an
hour
holding
his
nephew
by
the
hand
mammy
cely
had
come
for
him
at
last
saying
in
an
aside
i
gwineter
git
him
off
while
times
is
good
then
to
philip
tell
yo
uncle
richard
honey
uncle
wichard
he
said
obediently
philip
the
child
stood
as
if
waiting
he
waiting
fur
you
to
kiss
him
prompted
mammy
cely
he
ai
used
to
goin
off
bein
kissed
richard
de
jarnette
stooped
down
to
the
little
boy
who
put
his
arms
around
his
neck
as
if
that
were
the
only
way
to
do
philip
he
repeated
uncle
wichard
now
you
have
to
say
bless
my
boy
god
bless
my
boy
said
richard
de
jarnette
after
a
moment
surprised
delay
god
bless
my
mama
my
unker
wichard
philip
said
as
simply
as
he
said
it
every
night
and
went
away
quite
satisfied
an
hour
or
two
later
when
darkness
had
descended
upon
the
land
and
the
whippoorwill
was
sounding
his
lonely
call
mammy
cely
appeared
at
the
library
door
marse
richard
the
circus
done
let
in
he
has
begun
that
performance
again
well
replied
mammy
cely
conservatively
not
to
say
the
reely
pufformance
but
the
band
chunin
up
and
look
lak
you
the
i
ai
got
no
mo
to
say
now
than
one
of
the
spotted
ponies
or
the
clown
he
done
call
fur
it
was
inevitable
de
jarnette
laid
down
his
book
what
is
it
philip
he
asked
kindly
as
he
sat
down
by
the
bed
nothing
only
i
thes
it
was
lily
instead
of
got
away
it
was
that
got
squshed
oh
he
jes
makin
talk
marse
richard
explained
mammy
cely
in
an
undertone
he
ca
go
to
sleep
and
he
wants
you
to
stay
with
him
i
know
there
is
something
irresistible
in
a
child
turning
from
some
one
else
to
us
it
is
the
subtlest
kind
of
flattery
i
stay
with
him
a
while
go
on
if
you
want
to
he
half
wanted
to
try
the
experiment
of
managing
him
alone
when
she
was
gone
he
said
quietly
philip
would
you
rather
have
me
stay
with
you
than
mammy
cely
yes
sir
you
see
i
is
used
to
any
black
person
at
night
i
see
if
i
stay
with
you
will
you
be
a
brave
little
boy
and
not
cry
yes
sir
my
mama
told
me
i
must
be
bwave
but
one
little
hand
covered
his
lips
in
a
futile
attempt
to
shut
off
a
sob
i
afraid
i
ca
be
bwave
richard
de
jarnette
held
out
his
arms
coming
up
the
stairs
he
had
vowed
he
would
not
do
this
thing
do
you
want
to
sit
in
my
lap
yes
sir
in
his
uncle
protecting
embrace
the
nervous
child
said
stoutly
they
is
any
big
black
dogs
here
is
they
unker
wichard
no
indeed
and
they
is
anybody
trying
to
get
me
away
from
my
from
anybody
there
there
is
nothing
that
is
going
to
hurt
you
philip
was
the
grave
but
reassuring
reply
philip
lay
still
a
few
moments
in
relieved
content
then
he
enquired
seductively
you
do
know
any
stories
do
you
unker
wichard
adding
with
a
little
catch
in
his
voice
my
mama
always
tells
me
stories
stories
are
not
much
in
my
line
philip
but
perhaps
i
could
grind
out
one
i
know
i
could
go
to
sleep
on
one
said
philip
with
thrifty
providence
maybe
i
could
if
you
could
three
i
try
all
right
philip
settled
himself
for
solid
comfort
if
there
was
one
thing
that
he
loved
better
than
all
the
world
except
his
mother
it
was
a
good
story
this
is
a
story
about
a
dog
i
saw
on
pennsylvania
avenue
what
was
his
name
i
did
hear
his
name
was
it
rover
i
do
know
do
you
think
it
was
carlo
i
told
you
i
did
know
his
name
well
i
never
knew
any
people
told
stories
they
did
know
commented
his
auditor
thus
chastened
at
the
outset
richard
lost
that
confidence
which
is
the
prime
essential
to
success
in
the
gentle
art
of
he
proceeded
a
little
doubtfully
this
morning
philip
as
i
was
getting
on
a
car
what
car
one
on
pennsylvania
avenue
was
it
a
green
car
or
a
yellow
one
it
was
a
yellow
one
it
was
a
wed
car
no
it
was
a
yellow
one
oh
well
well
as
i
got
on
a
man
stepped
on
the
back
platform
and
his
dog
wanted
to
get
on
too
but
the
man
drove
him
back
and
then
got
on
thinking
i
suppose
that
the
dog
had
gone
home
but
instead
of
that
the
dog
ran
to
the
front
of
the
car
and
when
the
car
started
he
walked
in
and
stood
in
front
of
his
master
as
much
as
to
say
i
did
it
anyway
was
he
a
smart
dog
philip
was
silent
a
moment
did
he
say
anything
who
the
man
no
the
dog
why
certainly
not
did
he
wink
wink
no
what
did
the
man
say
he
did
say
anything
he
opened
his
paper
and
went
to
reading
philip
waited
what
the
rest
of
it
he
asked
at
length
there
is
any
more
that
the
end
of
the
story
he
said
it
in
rather
a
way
philip
raised
himself
to
a
sitting
posture
and
looked
his
uncle
straight
in
the
eye
unker
wichard
he
said
quietly
did
you
think
that
was
a
story
i
had
thought
so
acknowledged
de
jarnette
i
see
my
mistake
now
then
with
a
momentary
flash
of
spirit
he
enquired
what
wrong
with
that
story
any
way
it
do
begin
right
you
have
to
say
on
a
time
oh
you
do
well
if
you
know
my
story
better
than
i
do
suppose
you
tell
it
i
ca
said
philip
i
rather
tell
you
when
you
get
it
wrong
thus
unconsciously
enunciating
a
principle
of
criticism
as
old
as
time
if
all
the
critics
had
to
pass
a
novitiate
as
before
they
were
admitted
to
the
bar
as
there
is
danger
that
the
race
would
become
extinct
but
this
critic
was
not
through
and
then
unker
wichard
do
you
think
a
dog
that
do
say
anything
in
a
story
to
much
but
philip
dogs
do
talk
you
know
wolfs
talk
philip
was
reasoning
from
analogy
and
so
do
bears
you
the
old
papa
bear
saying
been
sitting
in
my
chair
and
the
little
baby
bear
saying
been
sitting
in
my
chair
suiting
his
tone
to
their
respective
ages
and
sizes
and
do
you
fox
and
brer
but
they
were
not
dogs
weakly
suggested
the
conscious
that
he
was
begging
the
question
the
dogs
talk
in
my
mama
stories
and
she
knows
their
names
too
unker
wichard
is
with
the
blue
eyes
filling
and
that
sentence
on
the
grieved
lips
richard
de
jarnette
felt
the
hair
of
his
flesh
rising
philip
he
said
hastily
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
red
riding
hood
this
was
philip
favorite
story
and
he
swallowed
his
tears
and
prepared
to
listen
de
jarnette
was
not
very
sure
of
his
ground
but
in
a
general
way
he
remembered
the
story
and
with
fatal
fatuity
trusted
to
be
able
to
supply
satisfactory
details
alas
for
the
success
of
such
a
scheme
a
memory
for
stories
is
verbal
and
circumstantial
and
a
deviation
is
a
crime
once
on
a
time
began
de
jarnette
he
was
sure
of
this
much
there
was
a
little
girl
named
red
riding
hood
i
do
know
why
she
was
named
that
it
was
almost
as
odd
a
name
for
a
girl
as
was
for
a
turtle
this
was
padding
he
had
perceived
that
his
other
story
was
too
condensed
it
was
she
had
a
little
red
cloak
with
a
hood
said
philip
that
part
of
the
story
of
course
i
had
thought
of
that
it
came
to
de
jarnette
whimsically
that
he
was
sharing
the
fate
of
all
padders
philip
had
instantly
picked
out
the
spurious
material
and
thrown
it
aside
well
this
little
girl
lived
with
her
mother
but
she
had
an
old
an
aunt
it
was
her
grandmother
corrected
his
audience
so
it
was
her
grandmother
do
hesitate
about
setting
me
right
any
time
philip
no
sir
i
wo
i
see
you
do
know
it
very
well
well
this
little
girl
went
over
one
day
to
take
her
aun
her
grandmother
some
flowers
unker
wichard
said
philip
in
a
tone
of
real
distress
it
flowers
it
was
a
pot
of
butter
i
believe
you
are
right
well
the
story
went
on
haltingly
and
with
many
corrections
and
amendments
it
seemed
incredible
to
philip
that
anybody
could
tell
a
story
so
poorly
once
when
the
thrilling
part
was
reached
detailing
the
colloquy
between
the
little
maid
and
the
wicked
wolf
de
jarnette
unhappily
dropped
into
the
indirect
quotation
a
thing
that
has
spoiled
many
a
dramatic
passage
in
the
so
when
the
little
girl
asked
the
wolf
what
made
his
eyes
so
large
he
told
her
it
was
so
that
he
could
see
everything
philip
had
been
sorely
tried
before
but
at
this
mangling
of
a
fine
thing
he
cried
out
in
utter
exasperation
unker
wichard
is
the
way
little
wed
widing
hood
says
what
makes
your
so
big
his
own
matched
the
wolf
and
then
the
old
wolf
says
the
better
my
dear
his
voice
was
terrible
to
hear
that
what
i
said
philip
in
substance
yes
but
you
did
say
it
like
you
believed
it
when
my
mama
tells
it
i
can
just
the
old
wolf
wichard
where
philip
i
have
finished
the
story
yet
in
his
alarm
he
threw
himself
into
the
remainder
of
the
narrative
with
a
frantic
eagerness
that
was
fairly
satisfactory
even
with
the
highly
dramatic
close
philip
found
no
fault
but
when
it
stopped
he
sat
with
muscles
tense
and
eyes
eager
he
was
plainly
waiting
for
something
else
well
he
said
de
jarnette
was
puzzled
well
that
the
end
philip
became
limp
my
mama
always
jumps
at
me
and
kisses
me
and
eats
me
up
he
announced
in
a
dignified
manner
he
felt
distinctly
defrauded
the
end
is
always
the
best
part
of
my
mama
stories
what
merciless
critics
children
are
how
by
instinct
they
see
the
weak
point
and
how
unerringly
they
strike
for
it
they
rocked
in
silence
for
a
while
and
then
philip
asked
in
a
polite
tone
in
which
there
was
still
a
note
of
hope
do
you
know
bible
stories
any
better
than
you
do
this
kind
unker
wichard
he
was
willing
to
give
his
uncle
another
chance
but
that
humiliated
gentleman
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
he
knew
even
less
about
bible
stories
than
the
kind
he
had
been
relating
then
i
guess
i
go
to
sleep
his
nephew
decided
with
unflattering
renunciation
but
sleep
was
hard
to
woo
i
do
shut
tight
and
tight
and
tight
but
they
fly
open
then
after
a
further
trial
unker
wichard
i
ca
never
go
to
sleep
without
kissing
mama
philip
suppose
you
tell
me
a
bible
story
suggested
de
jarnette
hurriedly
what
do
you
know
philip
reflected
a
story
of
his
telling
would
keep
his
uncle
there
just
the
same
i
know
in
the
bulwushes
that
will
do
nicely
wait
a
minute
let
me
turn
down
the
light
now
i
rock
you
while
you
tell
it
go
on
well
once
there
was
a
little
boy
named
moses
and
he
looked
thes
like
me
ought
you
to
say
upon
a
time
suggested
his
uncle
maliciously
why
no
sir
not
with
bible
stories
oh
you
have
to
say
there
was
a
little
boy
named
moses
and
my
mama
says
he
looked
thes
like
me
he
was
so
sweet
and
so
sweet
and
so
sweet
his
mama
used
ter
kiss
him
and
kiss
him
and
kiss
him
and
kiss
him
and
kiss
him
and
kiss
him
and
there
she
kissed
him
enough
now
go
on
well
there
was
a
wicked
man
in
that
country
and
he
was
going
to
take
all
the
little
chilwuns
from
their
mamas
where
was
that
country
i
do
know
sir
i
asked
mama
where
it
was
and
she
said
she
guessed
it
was
washington
humph
but
i
do
believe
it
was
though
gwandma
pennybacker
thes
laughed
the
way
she
does
when
mama
is
fooling
but
anyway
he
was
awful
bad
man
he
wanted
to
take
the
chilwuns
from
their
mamas
he
waited
a
moment
for
indorsement
of
this
sentiment
and
receiving
none
asked
ai
that
wicked
unker
wichard
supposed
to
be
yes
well
moses
mother
did
want
him
to
get
her
little
boy
so
she
hid
him
in
the
bulwushes
she
did
i
know
she
did
my
mama
said
so
she
set
the
basket
down
in
the
bulwushes
at
the
edge
of
the
wiver
black
wiver
wight
where
the
fwogs
and
the
turkles
was
unker
wichard
once
i
was
moses
indeed
in
a
former
incarnation
i
suppose
no
sir
it
was
in
a
carnation
at
all
it
was
in
a
basket
and
it
was
on
a
wiver
philip
what
are
you
talking
about
i
moses
my
mama
said
i
was
her
little
moses
we
was
on
a
boat
and
there
was
a
wicked
man
trying
to
get
me
and
my
mama
put
me
in
a
basket
and
richard
began
to
listen
with
interest
he
had
never
known
how
that
feat
had
been
accomplished
smeltzer
had
not
dilated
on
it
and
she
covered
me
up
in
the
basket
thes
like
moses
and
that
woman
my
mama
hugged
that
day
said
maybe
they
would
think
i
was
soiled
clothes
but
i
any
soiled
clothes
gwandma
pennybacker
said
i
was
even
clothes
and
i
kept
thes
as
still
mama
said
that
wicked
man
would
get
me
if
i
made
a
noise
what
did
they
do
with
you
why
that
woman
and
another
man
lifted
me
out
of
the
boat
and
took
me
somewhere
and
i
stayed
there
a
hundred
hours
and
then
the
boat
was
gone
and
another
boat
come
along
but
it
was
the
gwand
wapids
and
we
got
on
it
and
my
mama
thes
cried
and
cried
and
cried
was
that
funny
that
she
cried
when
we
had
got
away
but
she
did
put
me
down
with
the
fwogs
and
the
turkles
she
held
me
tight
and
tight
and
tight
the
recollection
of
that
sweet
embrace
was
too
much
for
him
unker
wichard
with
a
child
all
roads
lead
to
rome
the
story
ended
as
the
others
had
where
my
when
richard
de
jarnette
got
back
to
his
library
he
felt
as
if
he
had
had
a
nerve
tapped
if
this
was
to
continue
indefinitely
he
would
became
a
driveling
imbecile
the
plaint
had
such
a
haunting
piteous
ring
as
he
was
turning
over
the
papers
on
the
library
table
his
hand
accidentally
encountered
the
picture
bess
had
given
him
he
took
it
up
and
looked
at
it
it
was
margaret
at
her
best
the
roundness
of
curve
belonging
to
young
womanhood
was
still
there
but
when
he
thought
of
her
as
a
bride
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
face
had
in
it
a
subtle
something
that
the
bride
face
did
not
have
maternity
had
deepened
the
shadows
around
the
eyes
and
care
inseparable
from
maternity
had
added
lines
here
and
there
that
would
never
be
retouched
the
mouth
was
firmer
than
he
remembered
his
to
have
been
he
recalled
how
like
a
child
that
mouth
had
been
the
day
he
told
her
victor
was
gone
it
was
a
rare
face
in
contour
and
in
character
he
smiled
to
think
how
faces
like
figures
could
lie
yes
a
beautiful
face
but
not
one
especially
to
stir
a
man
it
was
pure
madonna
a
pair
of
chubby
arms
were
clasped
about
her
neck
and
to
her
softly
rounded
cheek
was
pressed
a
baby
face
so
like
her
own
and
yet
to
richard
eyes
so
like
another
baby
face
that
he
remembered
well
the
picture
was
good
of
philip
now
though
it
must
have
been
taken
well
perhaps
he
turned
the
picture
over
to
look
for
a
possible
date
for
grandma
pennybacker
it
said
in
margaret
writing
and
then
baby
philip
aged
two
below
this
was
a
newspaper
clipping
pasted
neatly
on
the
card
he
read
the
title
curiously
my
page
and
then
the
lines
it
seemed
to
have
been
put
there
as
though
the
picture
and
the
poem
belonged
together
long
years
ago
i
held
within
my
grasp
an
open
page
a
fair
white
goodly
page
whereon
to
write
a
life
i
filled
it
full
with
love
and
love
sweet
ministries
with
home
and
the
dear
homely
cares
which
make
most
full
a
woman
life
my
husband
sheltering
care
and
the
soft
prattle
of
a
baby
voice
and
then
in
very
peace
and
restfulness
i
closed
my
eyes
and
said
thank
thee
lord
for
life
he
turned
the
picture
over
and
looked
long
at
the
face
he
did
not
see
philip
this
time
what
was
this
thing
had
she
written
it
herself
or
only
found
it
somewhere
and
pasted
it
on
the
back
of
the
photograph
before
giving
it
away
perhaps
the
older
woman
had
put
it
there
he
read
on
a
moment
only
then
i
heard
happy
sheltered
life
but
is
not
thine
i
reached
my
hand
to
grasp
my
treasured
page
it
closed
upon
a
bare
blank
sheet
no
more
and
still
the
voice
said
he
looked
again
at
the
picture
this
sounded
as
if
it
might
be
an
echo
from
her
own
life
was
it
yet
he
had
always
thought
her
so
cold
through
falling
tears
that
blurred
the
page
and
hid
the
lines
with
fainting
heart
and
faltering
hand
i
took
the
pen
it
seemed
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
write
i
could
not
fill
the
page
one
bare
bald
word
came
to
me
as
i
wrote
that
word
was
duty
and
i
wrote
it
and
and
then
so
tender
is
our
god
so
kind
the
words
grew
luminous
beneath
my
pen
and
as
i
wrote
were
changed
to
and
was
it
then
the
same
fair
page
ah
no
this
had
a
margin
wide
and
deep
and
bare
with
many
a
name
erased
and
line
left
out
but
was
my
own
my
very
own
and
all
i
had
and
clutching
it
with
grip
i
held
it
to
me
as
i
wrote
once
more
there
came
to
him
the
very
sound
of
her
voice
as
she
said
passionately
to
him
the
day
he
tried
to
effect
a
reconciliation
all
i
want
now
is
to
be
allowed
to
live
my
own
life
with
my
child
a
whirlwind
came
a
tempest
fierce
and
wild
broke
on
my
helpless
head
and
bore
me
down
it
wrenched
my
page
away
and
beat
it
in
the
ground
and
then
it
passed
and
left
me
there
a
broken
prostrate
thing
but
ere
the
surge
and
roar
had
ceased
there
fell
upon
my
ear
the
same
word
lord
i
cried
can
i
write
my
page
is
gone
the
fragments
torn
and
soiled
and
beaten
to
the
earth
scrap
alone
i
hold
of
all
that
once
was
mine
the
voice
said
tenderly
that
thou
hast
and
write
i
listened
and
obeyed
i
took
the
scrap
so
pitifully
small
smoothed
out
the
crumpled
edges
and
began
and
as
i
wrote
oh
marvel
unforeseen
a
hand
invisible
divine
joined
on
another
scrap
and
smoothed
the
seam
and
made
it
ready
for
my
pen
and
thus
as
days
go
on
the
page
still
grows
is
not
the
one
i
fain
would
have
is
seamed
and
and
blurred
with
many
tears
is
not
the
one
i
planned
but
as
i
look
at
it
i
know
it
is
the
one
my
father
meant
for
me
and
so
because
he
bids
me
still
i
write
richard
de
jarnette
laid
the
picture
down
gently
and
went
outside
he
felt
bewildered
it
was
a
moonless
starless
night
for
an
hour
or
more
a
glowing
spark
moved
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
in
the
rose
garden
his
mother
had
planted
chapter
xxvi
face
to
face
it
was
weeks
before
margaret
emerged
from
the
shadow
of
death
that
fell
upon
her
that
day
in
the
when
she
did
she
looked
like
one
of
the
shades
the
fever
had
wrought
sad
ravages
it
too
bad
whispered
maria
van
dorn
to
bess
the
first
time
she
saw
her
a
woman
has
lost
all
when
she
lost
her
beauty
and
she
glanced
with
a
degree
of
satisfaction
at
her
own
fair
reflection
the
contrast
was
striking
maria
had
never
been
in
better
flesh
or
color
i
had
thought
of
that
said
bess
i
so
glad
to
see
her
alive
but
if
margaret
cheeks
were
hollow
and
the
rose
tint
gone
the
light
that
shone
above
them
was
undimmed
from
their
deep
setting
her
great
eyes
glowed
like
smouldering
coals
they
kept
her
at
the
hospital
as
long
as
they
could
delaying
the
upon
every
possible
pretext
when
at
last
she
came
the
house
was
swept
and
garnished
but
very
empty
she
went
from
room
to
room
they
had
removed
every
trace
of
a
presence
as
people
do
when
the
dead
are
laid
away
i
want
every
thing
put
back
in
its
place
she
said
his
bed
his
chair
his
playthings
they
must
be
ready
for
him
when
he
comes
then
as
pennybacker
looked
up
with
quick
apprehension
she
said
with
a
smile
no
it
is
not
fever
it
is
faith
i
thought
it
all
out
while
i
was
at
the
hospital
god
will
never
let
me
lose
my
child
when
judge
kirtley
came
she
talked
it
over
with
a
calm
cheerfulness
that
amazed
him
listening
to
his
report
of
what
had
been
done
and
putting
in
now
and
then
a
question
which
showed
her
mind
to
be
clear
and
alert
while
she
was
helpless
judge
kirtley
had
not
been
idle
his
next
move
he
told
her
would
be
to
attack
the
validity
of
the
law
upon
which
the
will
rested
since
the
will
itself
had
been
sustained
by
the
probate
court
and
that
decision
had
been
practically
reaffirmed
by
the
court
which
had
just
awarded
the
custody
of
the
child
to
the
guardian
and
they
had
no
new
evidence
to
offer
this
seemed
to
him
their
best
show
in
all
his
practice
he
had
never
known
a
case
of
this
kind
before
and
he
proposed
now
to
test
the
law
he
had
associated
with
himself
a
firm
of
successful
attorneys
in
middle
life
who
were
working
upon
the
case
with
much
interest
we
may
not
see
the
end
of
this
for
a
long
time
my
child
but
when
we
do
i
expect
to
have
a
decision
in
your
favor
it
will
be
she
said
it
with
such
implicit
confidence
that
he
felt
impelled
to
say
remembering
her
former
hopefulness
and
its
disastrous
overthrow
still
it
is
always
wise
to
look
the
possibility
of
defeat
in
the
face
no
she
said
i
will
not
look
the
possibility
of
defeat
in
the
face
some
day
i
will
get
him
it
seemed
almost
as
if
her
faith
were
inspired
the
court
had
provided
that
she
should
see
the
child
at
stated
intervals
he
told
her
philip
was
now
at
de
jarnette
country
home
and
was
he
was
informed
well
and
happy
her
lips
tightened
i
will
go
to
him
she
said
margaret
if
this
thing
could
be
settled
out
of
court
it
would
save
you
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
and
tedious
waiting
it
is
just
possible
that
having
been
successful
de
jarnette
might
be
in
a
compromising
frame
of
mind
sometimes
it
works
that
way
could
you
make
up
your
mind
to
see
him
yourself
i
can
make
up
my
mind
to
do
anything
that
is
necessary
she
said
it
seemed
to
the
old
judge
that
no
heart
of
flesh
and
blood
could
withstand
her
as
she
looked
that
day
sitting
by
the
window
of
his
office
the
next
afternoon
de
jarnette
saw
his
carriage
drive
slowly
down
the
street
and
stop
before
the
conococheague
building
harcourt
was
beside
her
he
was
much
at
the
massachusetts
avenue
house
these
days
and
pennybacker
encouraged
it
your
nonsense
will
do
her
good
just
now
she
told
him
she
needs
a
breeze
from
the
outside
world
that
will
freshen
the
air
without
blowing
directly
upon
her
after
this
he
fell
into
the
habit
of
dropping
in
at
odd
times
after
office
hours
and
occasionally
for
sunday
night
supper
de
jarnette
had
noticed
on
the
day
of
the
trial
when
margaret
lay
in
a
faint
that
he
came
directly
to
her
as
though
his
place
were
at
her
side
looking
at
them
now
as
they
sat
there
together
and
thinking
of
all
that
had
occurred
in
this
room
he
felt
somehow
bereft
anew
after
his
brother
death
he
had
given
up
his
own
room
across
the
hall
and
moved
into
the
one
victor
had
occupied
semple
had
urged
him
to
give
up
the
suite
and
go
somewhere
else
but
with
an
obstinacy
which
was
a
part
of
the
man
he
refused
on
the
floor
was
still
the
dark
spot
made
by
victor
de
jarnette
life
blood
his
brother
would
never
even
have
the
carpet
changed
only
the
luxurious
furnishings
of
the
room
had
given
place
to
the
plain
office
furniture
of
the
room
across
the
hall
it
was
here
that
he
received
margaret
if
he
had
planned
her
coming
he
would
have
received
her
here
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
in
the
room
since
the
day
her
husband
lay
dead
on
the
floor
instinctively
her
eyes
sought
the
place
and
richard
de
jarnette
watching
her
closely
saw
a
shudder
pass
through
her
the
same
expression
of
horror
that
convulsed
her
features
that
day
came
over
them
again
it
was
but
momentary
however
she
had
come
here
for
a
purpose
and
she
was
not
to
be
deterred
she
threw
her
soul
into
that
plea
you
come
to
me
here
he
said
at
length
in
a
tone
that
promised
little
in
this
room
to
urge
the
setting
aside
of
my
dead
will
why
should
i
not
you
know
he
had
no
right
to
make
such
a
will
no
moral
right
he
had
a
legal
right
he
said
cruelly
on
that
i
stand
then
looking
at
her
fixedly
and
speaking
with
slow
emphasis
as
if
weighing
every
word
and
giving
her
time
to
do
the
same
had
he
been
permitted
to
live
out
his
life
he
might
himself
have
changed
the
provisions
of
that
will
have
rescinded
that
which
you
feel
to
be
cruel
and
unnatural
that
which
i
do
not
say
was
cruel
and
unnatural
but
his
eyes
sought
the
brown
spot
on
the
floor
and
hers
followed
them
before
he
could
do
this
his
life
was
cut
off
by
his
own
hand
she
and
the
possibility
of
undoing
what
he
had
done
was
wrested
from
him
well
let
it
stand
she
looked
at
him
as
if
she
were
trying
to
fathom
his
meaning
but
his
face
was
inscrutable
then
she
rose
i
have
made
my
last
appeal
to
you
she
said
it
is
useless
to
humiliate
myself
further
i
came
here
hoping
against
hope
that
having
vindicated
before
the
world
your
legal
right
to
the
guardianship
and
custody
of
my
child
you
might
then
be
so
just
so
generous
as
to
give
him
back
into
the
keeping
of
his
natural
guardian
but
i
have
overrated
you
he
surprised
her
by
a
reply
to
this
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
he
asked
quietly
that
you
might
have
underrated
me
no
never
suppose
for
one
moment
for
purposes
of
argument
only
that
i
am
not
the
thing
you
think
me
that
i
would
not
drag
shrieking
children
from
their
mother
breasts
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
the
thing
can
you
then
conceive
no
reason
why
i
should
feel
that
i
and
not
you
he
was
looking
searchingly
at
her
now
his
eyes
narrowing
and
concentrating
their
gleam
upon
her
face
should
have
the
keeping
of
my
dead
brother
child
she
shook
her
head
slowly
wonderingly
i
can
conceive
no
reason
no
possible
reason
oh
i
have
made
mistakes
if
that
is
what
you
mean
but
they
were
the
mistakes
of
a
brute
mother
robbed
a
tigress
when
she
sees
a
cobra
hanging
near
does
not
wait
to
have
the
jungle
lord
high
magistrate
pass
upon
the
case
she
springs
and
falls
upon
it
or
despairing
of
that
snatches
up
her
cub
and
flees
with
it
to
a
place
of
safety
did
that
no
more
i
was
a
woman
i
could
not
strike
and
so
i
caught
up
my
child
and
fled
the
judge
says
i
broke
the
law
she
threw
back
her
head
with
the
old
imperious
gesture
i
say
i
kept
it
nature
law
implanted
by
a
greater
than
judge
or
jury
but
humanly
speaking
it
was
a
mistake
i
grant
you
that
i
should
have
stayed
and
trusted
to
the
chance
that
a
stone
might
melt
have
knelt
a
suppliant
at
your
feet
saying
sir
i
recognize
your
right
the
law
of
course
is
just
but
give
a
poor
girl
back
her
baby
richard
de
jarnette
sat
motionless
before
her
not
taking
his
eyes
from
her
face
not
indicating
in
any
way
that
he
felt
her
thrusts
if
this
was
acting
it
was
good
of
its
kind
dropping
her
tone
of
bitter
satire
she
went
on
yes
a
mistake
but
one
that
i
shall
not
make
again
i
was
then
scarcely
more
than
child
myself
a
child
fighting
against
a
strong
man
and
the
law
but
let
it
pass
now
i
am
a
woman
and
old
old
a
few
years
like
these
would
crowd
eternity
she
stopped
a
moment
and
then
went
on
she
was
not
through
yet
richard
de
jarnette
you
have
might
on
your
side
the
will
a
wicked
wicked
one
a
law
so
infamous
that
its
very
wording
reeks
to
high
heaven
and
the
decision
of
the
court
against
all
these
i
put
my
woman
patience
and
the
right
and
i
defy
you
i
shall
win
this
time
i
shall
be
patient
oh
so
patient
and
tireless
as
the
insects
on
a
coral
reef
it
will
be
long
perhaps
i
may
be
when
it
comes
but
some
day
again
she
threw
her
head
back
not
raising
her
voice
above
its
former
low
pitch
but
speaking
with
incisive
utterance
that
cut
the
air
some
day
shall
have
my
for
it
is
right
and
in
the
end
right
wins
she
made
a
movement
to
pass
out
but
he
stopped
her
by
a
gesture
one
moment
please
there
is
something
concerning
philip
about
which
i
would
like
to
speak
to
you
will
you
not
be
seated
thank
you
i
will
stand
he
raised
his
brows
slightly
and
went
on
while
i
have
declined
and
shall
decline
to
relinquish
my
right
to
the
custody
of
my
dead
brother
child
margaret
eyes
flashed
he
always
spoke
of
the
child
in
this
way
never
as
hers
i
think
you
know
i
do
not
wish
to
make
it
harder
for
you
than
is
necessary
the
court
has
granted
you
the
privilege
of
seeing
him
at
stated
times
for
reasons
that
it
is
not
necessary
at
this
time
to
give
i
prefer
that
those
meetings
should
be
at
my
home
rather
than
at
yours
the
boy
will
be
kept
for
the
present
at
elmhurst
under
the
care
of
his
old
nurse
whom
you
know
and
trust
margaret
bowed
assent
i
will
say
to
you
frankly
that
i
do
not
consider
it
for
the
best
good
that
your
visits
should
be
more
frequent
than
provided
by
the
court
in
other
words
you
want
him
to
forget
me
she
broke
in
bitterly
he
did
not
answer
the
but
the
trains
run
past
elmhurst
at
such
hours
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
make
the
trip
in
a
morning
or
afternoon
at
any
time
that
it
suits
your
convenience
to
be
there
at
luncheon
i
trust
you
will
feel
at
liberty
to
do
so
she
looked
at
him
in
amazement
then
she
said
proudly
pardon
me
i
could
hardly
bring
myself
to
do
that
de
jarnette
he
bowed
gravely
as
you
will
another
thing
the
station
is
some
distance
from
the
house
if
you
will
let
them
know
when
to
expect
you
the
carriage
will
always
be
there
to
meet
you
there
seemed
the
strangest
incongruity
in
this
iron
man
arranging
for
her
comfort
and
convenience
while
persistently
doing
the
one
thing
that
broke
her
heart
she
felt
suddenly
ashamed
of
her
ungraciousness
thank
you
she
said
for
your
courtesy
i
i
beg
that
you
will
pardon
my
rudeness
true
the
right
to
be
always
with
my
child
is
already
mine
i
do
not
relinquish
one
jot
or
tittle
of
that
claim
but
i
realize
that
you
have
done
more
than
the
law
required
of
you
for
this
i
thank
you
but
it
must
be
distinctly
understood
that
i
am
not
to
be
bought
off
by
it
nor
will
my
efforts
to
recover
my
child
be
relaxed
the
fight
is
on
between
us
and
i
warn
you
that
i
shall
give
it
up
never
is
a
long
time
he
said
as
he
opened
the
door
for
her
and
bowed
her
out
a
long
time
she
repeated
except
for
god
and
mothers
when
richard
de
jarnette
went
back
into
his
office
he
sat
down
with
his
long
legs
stretched
out
before
him
and
his
eyes
staring
at
the
brown
spot
on
the
carpet
for
a
long
long
time
he
did
not
stir
at
last
he
roused
himself
i
would
give
ten
years
of
my
life
he
said
to
know
chapter
xxvii
at
elmhurst
if
there
had
been
any
latent
doubts
in
the
minds
of
margaret
friends
as
to
her
force
of
character
they
were
dispelled
in
the
weeks
that
followed
she
had
come
back
from
the
hospital
wasted
in
flesh
but
resolute
of
soul
her
period
of
convalescence
had
been
a
season
of
gathering
strength
for
a
protracted
effort
she
would
waste
no
force
after
this
in
beating
her
wings
against
restraining
bars
it
almost
seemed
to
pennybacker
as
she
watched
her
that
she
had
had
a
new
birth
her
whole
nature
was
deepened
and
broadened
even
her
interview
with
de
jarnette
did
not
daunt
her
i
have
been
too
impatient
she
said
once
i
can
see
now
how
i
have
injured
my
cause
by
injudicious
haste
if
i
had
not
run
off
with
philip
i
might
have
him
now
i
know
judge
kirtley
thinks
that
prejudiced
my
cause
and
you
know
what
the
judge
said
still
it
was
instinct
yes
but
i
find
that
this
is
a
thing
about
which
i
must
use
more
than
instinct
oh
i
am
going
to
try
to
be
very
prudent
and
very
patient
i
do
want
to
do
anything
that
will
lose
me
one
point
margaret
said
pennybacker
plainly
you
are
losing
more
than
a
point
in
refusing
the
opportunity
that
richard
de
jarnette
puts
in
your
hands
a
whole
day
instead
of
an
hour
is
a
great
gain
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
not
only
accept
that
offer
but
you
will
thank
him
personally
or
by
letter
for
it
i
can
not
margaret
said
passionately
the
prudence
and
patience
she
had
felt
so
sure
of
cast
to
the
winds
i
will
not
be
indebted
to
him
for
one
thing
even
for
the
sake
of
being
with
philip
i
can
not
do
it
you
are
very
foolish
it
means
more
than
being
with
philip
how
could
it
possibly
help
me
in
any
other
way
there
is
a
principle
of
human
nature
involved
in
it
this
is
a
kindness
that
richard
de
jarnette
meant
to
do
you
you
will
acknowledge
that
but
well
a
kindness
done
always
disposes
the
heart
of
the
person
doing
it
toward
the
person
to
whom
it
is
done
i
do
want
his
heart
disposed
toward
me
cried
the
girl
he
is
a
cruel
despotic
man
i
hate
him
and
i
want
to
hate
him
pennybacker
looked
at
her
over
the
top
of
her
glasses
patience
has
hardly
had
her
perfect
work
with
you
yet
margaret
she
observed
dryly
it
was
true
as
margaret
had
said
that
she
did
not
want
any
favors
at
de
jarnette
hands
she
was
angry
with
him
for
placing
her
under
obligation
in
the
matter
of
the
carriage
angry
at
herself
for
allowing
him
to
do
it
and
angry
and
hurt
both
at
pennybacker
censure
they
ought
to
know
how
she
would
feel
she
told
herself
with
that
isolation
of
soul
which
comes
to
us
when
our
nearest
friends
fail
to
understand
but
when
she
found
herself
the
next
morning
at
the
little
country
station
a
mile
and
a
half
from
elmhurst
in
a
drizzling
rain
saw
a
solitary
carriage
in
waiting
and
heard
a
respectful
voice
that
belonged
to
a
past
age
saying
as
a
respectful
hat
was
raised
from
a
grizzled
old
head
is
you
de
lady
wha
goin
to
elmhurst
she
could
not
but
acknowledge
to
herself
that
her
knew
more
about
conditions
than
she
did
and
had
thoughtfully
prepared
for
them
yaas
the
old
driver
explained
as
she
stepped
into
the
carriage
marse
richard
he
say
you
be
comin
out
pretty
fur
a
while
an
i
was
to
keep
de
carriage
up
dem
days
so
you
could
have
it
whenuver
you
say
de
word
he
you
mos
likely
not
want
it
tell
evenin
i
shall
want
it
in
about
an
hour
she
said
with
a
sinking
sense
of
the
shortness
of
the
time
to
meet
the
noon
train
then
she
clenched
her
hands
in
a
swift
fierce
anger
that
this
man
should
be
able
to
impose
restrictions
upon
her
movements
when
she
reached
the
house
and
got
philip
in
her
arms
she
was
almost
sorry
she
had
committed
herself
how
quickly
the
time
was
flying
she
had
hoped
that
the
child
would
not
be
unhappy
but
she
was
mortally
afraid
of
his
ceasing
to
mourn
for
her
her
illness
had
kept
her
away
so
long
and
he
was
so
young
mammy
cely
with
intuitive
tact
dilated
upon
the
scenes
of
those
first
few
nights
when
he
had
refused
to
be
comforted
and
it
was
all
as
manna
to
her
hungry
soul
then
philip
expecting
commendation
said
but
i
do
cwy
any
more
mama
unker
wichard
bwings
me
candy
and
he
says
i
a
good
little
boy
now
philip
she
cried
despairingly
do
you
care
for
mama
as
you
did
at
first
do
you
still
want
her
at
night
it
seemed
to
her
she
could
not
bear
it
why
yes
mama
the
child
said
wonderingly
but
you
said
i
must
be
bwave
she
caught
him
to
her
arms
in
a
passion
of
jealousy
after
all
bravery
was
an
unnatural
virtue
in
a
child
oh
mammy
cely
she
begged
when
at
last
she
tore
herself
away
from
him
let
him
forget
me
i
aint
gwineter
let
him
forgit
you
miss
margaret
do
you
worry
i
think
of
i
gwinter
call
you
to
that
yaas
i
is
so
and
on
this
assurance
she
was
forced
to
rest
twice
a
week
the
court
had
said
those
visits
came
to
be
margaret
meat
and
drink
to
the
child
as
time
went
by
they
were
only
an
incident
in
his
daily
life
he
had
settled
into
the
routine
of
the
place
lonely
sometimes
but
finding
in
mammy
cely
and
uncle
tobe
companions
very
much
to
his
taste
every
old
negro
of
the
ancient
school
is
an
uncle
remus
to
some
child
and
uncle
tobe
was
no
exception
he
and
his
wife
aunt
dicey
lived
in
one
of
the
cabins
behind
the
house
as
they
had
done
before
the
war
they
had
been
pensioners
of
richard
de
jarnette
through
all
the
years
of
his
residence
in
washington
now
that
he
had
come
back
to
elmhurst
with
his
little
nephew
they
fell
into
line
as
cook
and
coachman
the
old
carriage
so
long
unused
was
brought
out
for
margaret
special
use
uncle
tobe
furbishing
it
up
for
the
occasion
with
tremulous
eagerness
it
seemed
to
him
almost
like
a
revival
of
the
old
days
when
miss
julia
had
to
be
driven
around
they
were
all
very
kind
to
the
child
he
fed
the
chickens
and
hunted
for
eggs
and
played
with
the
gourds
that
aunt
dicey
still
planted
and
hoarded
she
always
had
pomegranates
too
that
she
took
from
some
mysterious
place
about
her
bed
but
he
liked
the
gourds
best
because
they
were
of
so
many
different
sizes
that
he
could
play
they
were
almost
anything
he
followed
mammy
cely
about
incessantly
through
the
day
and
as
evening
came
on
would
run
down
through
the
lawn
with
the
big
elm
trees
in
it
to
meet
his
uncle
richard
de
jarnette
fell
into
the
habit
of
looking
for
the
solitary
little
figure
perched
on
the
post
of
the
big
gate
when
he
saw
him
philip
would
sing
out
hello
unker
wichard
and
then
dropping
to
the
ground
would
tug
manfully
to
open
the
gate
which
richard
by
a
performance
most
remarkable
to
philip
could
open
from
his
horse
it
was
such
a
manifest
mortification
to
the
child
not
to
be
able
to
do
this
from
the
ground
that
de
jarnette
sent
uncle
tobe
down
one
day
to
remedy
the
sagging
so
that
the
feat
could
be
accomplished
then
philip
joy
and
pride
knew
no
bounds
and
when
the
gate
was
opened
with
much
tugging
and
blowing
richard
would
lean
down
and
lift
the
child
in
front
of
him
for
a
canter
up
the
road
he
came
to
look
forward
to
it
with
almost
as
much
pleasure
as
philip
did
he
could
remember
when
victor
did
the
same
thing
the
day
margaret
came
mammy
cely
had
shown
her
philip
room
a
great
gloomy
unattractive
apartment
whose
windows
like
those
of
the
library
below
were
carefully
curtained
from
the
light
a
horrible
room
for
a
child
margaret
had
exclaimed
it
looks
like
a
prison
mammy
was
deeply
disappointed
for
her
part
she
could
see
nothing
the
matter
with
the
room
it
was
exactly
as
her
miss
julia
had
left
it
it
had
never
been
changed
even
by
the
second
de
jarnette
and
it
was
scrupulously
clean
she
had
herself
painted
the
hearth
that
morning
with
a
preparation
of
brickdust
and
milk
laid
on
with
a
rag
which
was
supposed
in
her
day
to
put
the
finishing
touch
to
an
apartment
with
an
open
fireplace
a
child
ought
to
have
cheerful
surroundings
and
light
margaret
had
said
pushing
back
the
heavy
curtain
and
this
paper
it
is
enough
to
give
him
the
horrors
mammy
cely
had
never
thought
any
of
these
things
about
the
room
but
the
next
morning
she
spoke
to
de
jarnette
as
he
was
starting
to
town
marse
richard
is
it
ever
occurred
to
yo
mind
that
philip
room
no
fittin
place
fur
him
to
stay
no
said
de
jarnette
in
surprise
what
is
the
matter
with
it
that
room
too
sorrowful
lookin
fur
a
chile
marse
richard
hit
ought
to
have
some
sort
of
hilarious
paper
on
the
walls
and
tarletan
curtains
or
somethin
that
will
let
in
the
sunshine
yaas
sir
needs
light
jes
like
plants
de
jarnette
listened
without
replying
but
he
turned
back
and
went
to
philip
room
it
certainly
was
rather
a
gloomy
place
he
reflected
though
he
had
never
thought
of
it
before
the
brussels
carpet
was
and
dark
and
worn
the
moths
having
consumed
a
yard
or
so
around
the
edge
loving
darkness
rather
than
light
because
their
deeds
were
evil
they
had
found
here
a
congenial
home
mammy
had
seen
to
it
that
the
curtains
were
closely
drawn
he
groped
his
way
across
the
room
and
shook
them
impatiently
remembering
that
a
child
needed
light
they
gave
out
a
musty
smell
then
he
looked
at
the
walls
the
paper
certainly
could
not
be
called
hilarious
he
looked
around
the
room
with
a
growing
discontent
and
uncertainty
of
himself
strange
that
an
old
negro
should
have
thought
of
all
this
he
could
see
now
that
it
was
no
place
for
a
child
but
he
had
been
into
that
room
time
and
again
and
it
had
never
occurred
to
women
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
instinct
for
these
things
he
made
no
comment
when
he
came
down
nor
did
mammy
cely
being
wise
in
her
generation
she
left
her
seed
to
germinate
but
he
said
to
her
one
morning
a
week
or
two
later
get
the
things
moved
out
of
philip
room
i
am
going
to
have
some
work
done
in
it
the
men
will
be
out
the
painters
and
were
hardly
through
when
a
load
of
furniture
came
out
from
washington
de
jarnette
being
in
doubt
as
to
the
exact
amount
of
hilarity
that
the
good
of
a
child
demanded
had
gone
to
a
decorator
and
put
the
matter
in
his
hands
then
to
a
furniture
store
telling
the
proprietor
that
he
wanted
suitable
furniture
and
drapery
for
a
child
room
which
must
be
light
and
cheerful
the
bedroom
suit
already
in
it
was
solid
mahogany
and
almost
priceless
as
an
antique
but
de
jarnette
gave
him
and
the
dealer
naturally
made
the
most
of
his
opportunity
there
was
a
scurrying
around
at
elmhurst
that
last
day
as
there
had
not
been
since
the
advent
of
the
second
de
jarnette
mammy
cely
was
bent
upon
having
all
in
readiness
by
the
time
philip
mother
came
de
jarnette
apparently
did
not
know
that
philip
had
a
mother
he
had
never
asked
any
questions
about
her
comings
or
her
goings
what
he
was
doing
was
for
philip
when
margaret
came
mammy
cely
took
her
with
great
pride
to
the
room
in
view
of
her
disapproval
before
there
was
every
reason
to
expect
approval
now
and
then
the
room
itself
commanded
it
on
the
walls
climbed
over
a
neutral
ground
clustering
thick
over
a
trellis
at
the
top
where
an
occasional
butterfly
and
humming
bird
poised
as
if
just
ready
to
fly
the
dark
stained
woodwork
had
given
place
to
an
ivory
white
a
pretty
matting
was
on
the
floor
and
over
this
a
cheery
rug
in
such
colors
as
a
child
might
like
while
the
four
great
windows
were
hung
with
simple
muslin
curtains
draped
high
to
let
in
the
autumn
light
margaret
stood
just
inside
the
room
and
surveyed
it
all
the
little
white
bed
the
diminutive
dresser
and
chiffonier
of
bird
eye
maple
where
last
week
had
been
the
heavy
mahogany
even
a
set
of
shelves
which
held
philip
rapidly
accumulating
treasures
and
see
mama
my
little
wocking
chair
that
unker
wichard
bwinged
me
said
philip
she
turned
away
with
mouth
so
stern
that
mammy
cely
asked
anxiously
did
they
fix
it
right
miss
margaret
somehow
the
room
had
not
been
the
success
she
had
hoped
the
human
heart
is
full
of
strange
contradictions
as
she
looked
at
all
these
things
just
what
she
herself
would
have
chosen
for
a
room
there
came
to
margaret
a
fierce
anger
that
he
her
enemy
should
have
done
it
he
was
trying
to
worm
himself
into
the
affections
trying
to
buy
his
love
she
had
gone
home
the
week
before
telling
of
that
gloomy
room
and
hugging
to
her
soul
this
grievance
robbed
of
it
she
felt
defrauded
a
sudden
thought
struck
her
did
you
tell
de
jarnette
what
i
said
no
declared
mammy
cely
not
doubting
that
what
she
said
was
gospel
truth
i
ai
tole
him
nothin
what
you
said
i
jes
mentioned
to
him
that
the
room
was
sorter
mournful
an
that
was
enough
miss
margaret
honey
it
look
to
me
lak
marse
richard
to
do
what
right
by
this
chile
bring
me
his
clothes
said
margaret
coldly
i
put
them
in
the
drawers
myself
she
did
not
mean
to
be
unkind
but
she
was
consumed
with
jealousy
but
before
she
had
disposed
of
the
things
in
the
various
drawers
she
felt
ashamed
of
this
unworthy
feeling
i
am
glad
it
is
changed
she
said
it
was
very
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
kind
or
good
or
thoughtful
but
mammy
cely
supplied
the
word
he
mighty
good
to
him
miss
margaret
ai
he
honey
yes
said
philip
he
bwings
me
candy
and
every
night
i
go
down
to
meet
him
can
open
the
big
gate
now
and
margaret
heart
felt
another
twinge
mama
brought
you
something
darling
a
dear
little
baby
to
hang
on
the
wall
he
will
be
company
for
you
it
was
a
madonna
picture
a
bodenhausen
with
the
flowing
tresses
and
the
deep
sad
eyes
philip
was
full
of
interest
in
the
baby
he
thes
been
havin
a
bath
he
explained
and
mammy
cely
who
had
little
knowledge
of
art
but
much
of
nature
commented
jes
look
at
the
creases
in
the
little
laig
aint
that
that
is
the
way
mama
used
to
hold
you
darling
when
you
were
a
dear
helpless
little
baby
i
am
going
to
hang
it
over
there
in
front
of
the
bed
so
you
can
see
it
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
it
looks
like
you
mama
he
said
thoughtfully
it
got
the
smile
of
you
the
smile
of
the
bodenhausen
is
very
sad
she
caught
him
passionately
to
her
arms
does
it
look
to
you
like
mama
then
every
morning
when
you
look
at
it
you
must
say
is
mama
and
little
philip
i
will
he
promised
eagerly
and
i
show
it
to
unker
wichard
philip
philip
she
felt
that
he
was
slipping
away
from
her
oh
mammy
cely
make
him
remember
me
i
will
miss
margaret
the
old
woman
declared
and
to
mystification
they
were
both
in
tears
the
baby
in
that
picture
is
white
and
my
baby
was
black
but
somehow
the
crease
in
that
little
laig
make
me
think
of
cass
ai
gwineter
let
him
furgit
you
no
in
their
interest
in
the
picture
and
all
it
stood
for
they
forgot
the
time
till
aunt
dicey
announced
dinner
margaret
looked
at
her
watch
in
dismay
the
noon
train
was
gone
go
on
down
to

miss
margaret
insisted
mammy
cely

things
in
this
world
you
think
you
ca
i
guess
that
so
said
margaret
i
used
to
think
then
with
sudden
helplessness
i
do
know
what
i
think
nowadays
well
i
stay
and
when
she
sat
down
to
the
cosy
meal
with
philip
across
from
her
and
mammy
cely
in
beaming
attendance
she
wondered
that
she
could
ever
have
been
so
blind
as
not
to
see
that
this
gave
her
an
advantage
that
an
stay
never
could
how
much
easier
to
keep
herself
in
remembrance
if
she
sat
thus
with
him
every
time
she
came
surely
richard
de
jarnette
could
not
have
thought
of
this
chapter
xxviii
hearts
and
skins
mammy
cely
said
philip
one
day
after
a
thoughtful
consideration
of
her
face
what
makes
you
black
i
ca
it
honey
god
made
me
that
way
the
child
looked
at
her
in
perplexity
well
what
did
he
do
it
for
there
was
no
answer
to
this
somewhat
difficult
question
and
he
continued
would
you
rather
be
white
i
ruther
be
white
replied
mammy
cely
but
when
the
lord
made
me
he
was
askin
my
druthers
oh
said
philip
wondering
what
her
druthers
were
but
adding
after
a
while
in
extenuation
of
the
almighty
ways
perhaps
he
forgot
it
he
felt
convinced
that
it
was
a
mistake
and
it
might
not
be
too
late
yet
to
remedy
it
he
determined
to
incorporate
into
his
nightly
prayer
for
her
a
petition
for
a
change
of
color
he
was
careful
never
to
voice
this
when
he
was
saying
his
prayers
to
her
for
he
wanted
it
to
come
to
her
as
a
surprise
every
morning
his
first
concern
was
to
see
whether
the
transformation
had
been
wrought
in
the
night
mammy
cely
could
not
understand
his
eager
look
into
her
face
each
day
and
his
subsequent
look
of
disappointment
still
he
prayed
on
one
day
a
sudden
thought
came
to
him
and
he
hunted
her
up
mammy
cely
i
know
now
what
will
make
you
white
well
the
lord
said
mammy
cely
to
herself
he
still
on
that
same
ole
string
then
with
animation
what
is
it
honey
what
gwineter
work
that
meracle
you
must
wash
in
the
blood
of
a
lamb
i
thes
about
it
and
it
will
make
you
whiter
than
the
snow
that
so
said
the
old
woman
reverently
bless
the
lord
i
gwineter
be
white
some
day
she
said
it
so
confidently
that
philip
was
still
looking
for
the
time
to
come
he
was
a
mature
child
for
his
years
like
most
children
reared
without
companions
of
their
own
age
to
de
jarnette
unaccustomed
as
he
was
to
children
it
seemed
sometimes
that
the
things
he
said
were
positively
uncanny
when
in
fact
they
were
but
the
natural
working
of
a
childish
brain
mammy
cely
told
him
what
philip
had
said
about
the
lamb
where
in
the
world
did
he
get
that
he
asked
wonderingly
i
reckon
he
had
heared
the
song
and
thought
it
meant
changin
of
the
skins
the
hearts
the
child
had
settled
down
now
in
his
new
home
and
seldom
made
any
protest
mammy
cely
was
very
good
to
him
and
he
followed
her
about
from
morning
till
night
his
uncle
richard
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
having
him
in
the
library
with
him
for
an
hour
after
dinner
a
privilege
which
philip
greatly
valued
and
did
not
abuse
he
seldom
cried
now
or
asked
for
his
mother
appearing
to
understand
instinctively
that
this
was
a
subject
which
his
uncle
would
not
like
but
he
talked
freely
of
sous
haven
and
the
life
there
the
boats
particularly
the
gwand
wapids
about
the
turtles
that
harcourt
caught
for
him
the
forts
he
made
him
and
the
bonfires
they
had
on
the
beach
harcourt
was
in
most
of
his
tales
and
richard
read
a
good
deal
between
the
lines
one
cool
autumn
night
philip
sat
in
front
of
the
library
fire
in
his
little
chair
that
richard
had
brought
out
for
him
unker
wichard
do
you
ever
woast
in
your
fire
i
never
have
no
i
think
this
would
make
a
dandy
beach
fire
said
philip
suggestively
we
used
to
woast
at
sous
haven
we
had
a
big
fire
on
the
beach
and
harcourt
and
me
worked
hard
and
hard
getting
brush
for
it
and
harcourt
got
us
some
sticks
and
we
woasted
in
the
fire
the
sticks
no
sir
the
and
gwamma
pennybacker
was
there
and
d
harcourt
chased
me
wound
the
fire
and
we
had
lots
of
fun
and
d
then
my
mama
and
harcourt
and
bess
singed
songs
that
the
way
you
have
a
woast
he
sat
still
for
a
moment
and
then
said
persuasively
unker
wichard
we
play
that
you
was
harcourt
and
the
big
chair
was
gwamma
pennybacker
and
the
little
one
was
bess
and
unker
wichard
what
could
we
have
for
mama
we
would
most
have
to
have
mama
it
was
a
dangerous
subject
we
arrange
about
that
said
richard
hastily
when
we
have
the
now
tell
me
what
you
been
doing
i
been
keeping
off
the
calves
philip
said
promptly
thinking
of
the
latest
feat
his
mind
was
easily
diverted
now
aha
and
have
you
learned
to
milk
no
sir
i
ca
make
them
little
things
go
de
jarnette
threw
his
head
back
with
a
laugh
that
woke
the
echoes
in
the
silent
old
room
his
nephew
surveyed
him
with
mild
wonder
aunt
dicey
can
though
he
added
how
does
she
do
it
oh
she
puts
her
bucket
down
and
gives
old
spot
a
slap
wiv
her
hand
and
says
over
an
d
then
she
stoops
down
and
groans
and
says
h
my
lord
and
then
well
then
she
thes
pulls
the
triggers
mammy
cely
coming
at
that
moment
to
take
philip
to
bed
stopped
short
in
the
doorway
she
had
not
heard
her
marse
richard
laugh
like
that
for
many
a
long
year
richard
found
himself
smiling
over
his
paper
when
they
were
gone
the
child
said
such
unexpected
things
he
recalled
the
beach
scene
too
philip
had
made
it
stand
out
vividly
he
hardly
thought
he
could
take
harcourt
place
in
about
an
hour
mammy
cely
returned
philip
was
restless
and
would
be
satisfied
with
nothing
but
his
uncle
richard
he
he
wants
to
say
his
prayers
to
you
his
prayers
repeated
de
jarnette
in
perplexity
there
were
always
some
new
developments
about
this
child
what
does
he
want
to
say
his
prayers
to
me
for
this
is
incipient
catholicism
marse
richard
a
chile
always
has
to
say
his
prayers
to
some
person
he
do
know
nothin
sayin
to
god
god
done
put
the
mother
of
a
chile
in
his
place
he
knows
how
is
and
when
the
mother
is
tuk
away
that
will
do
interrupted
de
jarnette
curtly
scuse
me
marse
richard
mammy
cely
returned
humbly
i
did
mean
nothin
yes
i
know
you
did
mean
anything
except
to
say
exactly
what
you
wanted
to
say
and
you
said
it
now
so
go
on
tell
him
i
will
be
there
after
a
little
he
added
as
she
left
the
room
he
felt
that
it
was
a
weakness
in
him
to
go
he
had
told
philip
that
he
must
never
send
for
him
again
if
he
went
now
he
would
probably
be
expected
to
do
so
every
night
and
that
he
certainly
should
not
do
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
refuse
the
child
request
tyranny
was
so
affectionate
so
gentle
the
flattery
of
it
was
so
insidious
that
it
was
simply
irresistible
besides
there
was
something
in
what
mammy
cely
had
said
well
philip
they
tell
me
you
got
balled
up
in
your
devotions
he
said
sitting
down
by
the
little
white
bed
sir
could
you
say
your
prayers
to
mammy
cely
no
sir
i
i
ca
say
very
good
to
any
black
person
in
the
next
room
mammy
cely
was
chuckling
to
herself
he
did
not
seem
very
particular
about
saying
them
to
any
white
person
he
talked
instead
about
all
the
things
he
could
think
of
to
ward
off
the
evil
hour
of
going
to
sleep
and
richard
his
heart
strangely
soft
toward
this
mite
of
humanity
who
wanted
him
and
called
for
him
defied
all
the
rules
of
hygiene
demanding
early
hours
and
let
him
talk
mammy
cely
was
gone
having
petitioned
to
go
down
to
sist
dicey
on
an
errand
it
was
her
policy
to
leave
uncle
and
child
together
as
much
as
possible
at
this
hour
at
length
de
jarnette
said
firmly
now
philip
you
really
must
go
to
sleep
i
have
to
say
my
pwayers
first
said
philip
i
ca
go
to
sleep
wivout
saying
my
pwayers
he
knew
that
this
was
an
exercise
which
could
be
prolonged
indefinitely
well
go
on
i
have
to
kneel
down
first
kneel
down
then
philip
slipped
out
of
bed
and
stood
before
him
i
have
to
put
my
head
on
somebody
lap
put
it
against
my
knee
i
ca
it
has
to
be
somefin
soft
kneel
down
by
the
bed
then
i
ca
say
my
pwayers
to
the
bed
philip
said
reproachfully
then
catching
sight
of
a
comforter
across
the
bed
he
suggested
maybe
you
could
make
a
lap
to
humor
him
de
jarnette
threw
the
comforter
across
his
knees
conveniently
spread
apart
philip
dropped
his
head
upon
the
manufactured
substitute
to
its
immediate
undoing
my
mama
lap
do
come
to
pieces
he
remarked
critically
wait
till
i
get
this
thing
under
my
feet
retorted
his
uncle
i
ought
to
be
able
to
make
a
lap
that
will
stand
you
now
sir
i
ready
for
you
it
sounded
like
a
challenge
his
nephew
hungry
for
a
romp
made
a
battering
ram
of
himself
and
again
the
lap
caved
in
when
it
was
reconstructed
philip
put
his
head
down
very
gently
increasing
the
pressure
with
every
word
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
i
pway
thee
lord
my
soul
there
was
a
gurgle
of
laughter
down
in
the
comforter
unker
wichard
it
giving
way
philip
you
rascal
you
making
it
give
way
wait
now
i
got
it
with
the
comforter
under
both
feet
he
made
a
lap
that
could
withstand
a
small
boy
even
and
philip
recognizing
the
fact
that
his
romp
was
over
folded
his
hands
and
bowed
his
head
saying
reverently
the
sweet
prayer
that
so
many
infant
lips
have
lisped
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
i
pray
thee
lord
my
soul
to
keep
if
i
should
die
before
i
wake
i
pray
thee
lord
my
soul
to
take
and
this
i
ask
for
jesus
sake
amen
it
came
into
richard
de
jarnette
mind
as
he
sat
thus
what
a
ridiculous
figure
he
would
cut
if
any
of
his
business
friends
should
see
him
at
this
moment
and
yet
strange
to
say
the
situation
was
not
all
ludicrous
to
him
he
had
never
listened
to
a
child
prayers
before
philip
he
said
softly
philip
raised
his
head
but
made
no
motion
to
raise
i
not
through
yet
i
have
said
the
bless
then
lowering
his
curly
head
again
he
repeated
in
an
entirely
conversational
tone
god
bless
my
mama
and
bwing
her
back
to
her
little
boy
and
god
bless
gwanma
pennybacker
and
god
bless
bess
and
make
her
a
good
girl
and
god
bless
mammy
cely
and
make
her
white
be
to
make
her
white
cause
she
wants
to
be
and
you
forgot
her
druthers
when
you
made
her
and
god
bless
uncle
wichard
and
take
away
his
stony
heart
he
stopped
suddenly
thinking
that
perhaps
he
ought
not
to
have
said
this
where
did
you
hear
that
philip
my
mama
said
so
unker
wichard
what
is
a
stony
heart
richard
de
jarnette
laughed
a
rather
mirthless
laugh
but
did
not
answer
the
question
i
suppose
your
mama
has
told
you
a
number
of
pleasant
things
about
me
he
said
and
his
tone
had
an
infusion
of
bitterness
in
it
the
opinion
of
this
midget
was
becoming
important
to
him
she
said
she
did
believe
that
anything
would
change
your
heart
but
gwanma
pennybacker
said
god
could
do
anything
he
could
change
it
and
i
must
ask
him
every
night
to
take
away
your
stony
heart
and
give
you
a
a
he
was
trying
very
hard
to
recall
the
words
a
heart
of
do
know
somefin
but
it
was
stone
i
am
afraid
you
have
two
rather
tough
propositions
philip
my
heart
and
mammy
cely
skin
but
she
turning
unker
wichard
the
child
declared
eagerly
she
is
i
saw
it
on
the
inside
of
her
hands
when
she
was
washing
they
are
white
now
then
earnestly
unker
wichard
yo
heart
stone
i
guess
my
heart
is
not
very
different
from
other
men
philip
though
it
would
be
hard
to
make
some
people
think
so
but
do
have
the
same
kind
of
hearts
the
child
persisted
he
had
got
up
from
his
knees
and
climbed
into
his
uncle
lap
he
looked
around
the
room
in
a
half
scared
way
and
said
almost
in
a
whisper
some
people
have
wolf
hearts
nonsense
they
do
honest
unker
wichard
philip
said
his
uncle
sternly
where
did
you
get
all
that
from
mammy
cely
says
so
i
asked
once
did
she
ever
have
any
little
child
like
me
and
she
said
once
she
did
but
a
man
with
a
wolf
heart
came
and
took
it
away
from
her
unker
wichard
do
people
that
take
little
chilwuns
from
their
mamas
gypsies
and
like
that
do
they
always
have
wolf
hearts
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
authority
philip
on
the
subject
i
have
never
known
anybody
with
a
wolf
heart
in
fact
there
is
no
such
thing
you
must
not
believe
all
mammy
cely
stories
the
boy
snuggled
down
closer
you
have
any
wolf
heart
have
you
unker
wichard
or
any
stone
heart
either
no
neither
one
philip
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
i
awful
glad
if
it
was
stone
i
feel
sure
it
would
hurt
you
sometimes
my
heart
thes
thumps
when
i
run
and
if
it
was
a
wolf
heart
maybe
you
might
hurt
somebody
else
like
that
other
man
the
organ
in
question
was
beating
rather
tumultuously
just
now
was
it
possible
that
it
was
giving
its
impassive
owner
a
few
unseen
blows
or
was
it
that
the
fair
head
of
his
nephew
was
pressing
upon
it
overhard
it
seems
to
me
you
have
been
having
a
good
deal
of
heart
talk
lately
commented
de
jarnette
grimly
i
think
i
be
looking
after
some
of
it
he
looked
after
it
the
next
day
by
demanding
sternly
of
mammy
cely
what
do
you
mean
by
telling
philip
all
this
stuff
about
men
with
wolf
hearts
do
you
know
he
will
believe
it
i
wo
have
him
frightened
with
your
stories
then
thinking
of
her
rooted
antipathy
to
his
father
he
added
and
i
wo
have
you
saying
anything
to
him
about
the
de
jarnettes
either
since
finding
from
the
child
talk
that
the
varnums
were
held
up
constantly
before
him
he
had
felt
a
growing
jealousy
for
the
de
jarnette
name
mammy
cely
replied
with
her
accustomed
freedom
i
ai
tole
him
the
jarnettes
havin
wolf
hearts
done
it
him
nobody
ever
heared
me
runnin
down
my
own
white
folks
which
was
true
but
she
had
never
acknowledged
the
family
into
which
she
had
been
adopted
as
hers
save
the
one
lone
descendant
of
her
young
mistress
richard
himself
the
rest
to
her
were
as
scythians
and
barbarians
i
suttingly
ai
gwine
do
it
to
they
offspringers
but
richard
was
not
entirely
satisfied
well
do
let
me
hear
of
his
getting
any
more
such
notions
in
his
head
marse
richard
how
i
gwineter
the
convolvolutions
of
that
brain
why
he
axed
me
the
other
day
is
you
god
asked
you
what
axed
me
you
god
yes
sir
he
did
hit
the
truth
as
i
here
his
ma
had
tole
him
there
nobody
could
help
now
but
god
it
was
one
er
them
days
she
looked
lak
she
was
gwineter
die
she
was
so
low
down
and
the
next
day
when
he
come
to
me
and
ax
me
would
i
take
him
to
his
mama
just
for
a
little
while
i
says
not
knowin
she
done

it
on
the
almighty
i
say
fur
your
uncle
richard
to
say
and
at
that
he
look
kinder
scared
and
he
crope
up
close
to
me

did
and
he
say
sorter
low
like
cely
is
uncle
richard
god
so
thar
now
marse
richard
you
done
stan
in
the
place
of
his
maker
to
that
chile
go
along
to
your
work
said
richard
de
jarnette
with
unwonted
roughness
which
mammy
cely
did
not
resent
in
fact
it
rather
pleased
her
she
looked
after
him
as
he
strode
across
the
lawn
i
reckon
i
to
it
right
now
she
observed
with
an
astute
nod
he
ai
gwineter
furgit
that
when
a
person
know
he
stands
in
the
place
of
god
to
a
he
gwineter
walk
straight
low
down
chapter
xxix
inasmuch
weeks
lengthened
into
months
and
the
days
grew
short
philip
was
still
praying
for
mammy
cely
and
his
uncle
richard
but
the
black
woman
skin
was
not
yet
white
and
uncle
richard
heart
was
unchanged
the
case
dragged
its
slow
length
along
the
law
procrastination
is
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
lay
mind
margaret
chafed
at
it
without
avail
we
can
not
hurry
it
judge
kirtley
told
her
and
you
would
gain
nothing
if
you
could
it
may
be
six
months
before
it
is
settled
during
this
enforced
inactivity
and
its
consequent
restlessness
margaret
had
gone
one
day
to
the
children
home
to
execute
an
errand
for
pennybacker
when
she
returned
that
observant
lady
looked
up
at
her
and
said
quietly
what
is
it
margaret
the
girl
face
was
glowing
aunt
mary
i
have
seen
the
most
beautiful
child
so
like
philip
at
the
home
yes
the
matron
brought
in
a
lot
of
little
boys
for
me
to
try
the
mittens
on
and
this
one
was
the
very
last
his
likeness
to
philip
struck
me
so
that
before
i
had
time
to
control
myself
i
had
caught
him
up
in
my
arms
and
was
crying
over
him
i
acted
like
a
baby
but
it
came
over
me
all
at
once
what
if
philip
should
ever
be
cast
upon
the
world
like
this
pennybacker
wiped
her
eyes
what
was
his
name
louis
louis
lesseur
i
should
think
he
was
just
about
philip
age
he
seemed
so
sweet
and
affectionate
i
took
him
to
drive
are
his
parents
living
his
mother
is
it
is
a
very
sad
case
the
matron
says
she
is
a
widow
has
no
friends
and
they
think
has
only
a
few
months
to
live
and
she
is
so
desperately
anxious
about
what
will
become
of
this
child
aunt
mary
yes
margaret
would
it
be
foolish
and
quixotic
in
me
to
take
him
i
have
more
money
than
i
shall
ever
need
for
myself
and
philip
has
his
own
how
could
i
ever
use
my
surplus
better
than
to
give
this
child
a
chance
in
life
it
might
be
foolish
margaret
as
the
world
counts
wisdom
but
it
would
be
a
folly
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
ye
have
done
it
unto
me
later
she
said
fearing
that
she
had
given
undue
encouragement
margaret
do
do
this
thing
hastily
or
without
sufficient
consideration
you
would
want
in
the
first
place
to
find
out
all
about
his
antecedents
i
should
go
to
see
the
mother
you
do
want
a
child
with
bad
blood
he
is
not
responsible
for
his
blood
margaret
said
quickly
no
but
you
would
rather
it
would
be
good
you
quoted
christ
words
a
moment
ago
do
you
suppose
he
ever
inquired
into
people
blood
before
he
helped
them
no
i
do
but
with
a
wisdom
born
of
a
study
of
the
world
not
of
the
scriptures
it
will
pay
you
to
do
it
then
you
ought
to
find
out
whether
he
and
philip
like
each
other
children
have
as
strong
likes
and
dislikes
as
grown
people
it
is
partly
on
philip
account
that
i
want
to
take
him
they
would
be
companions
besides
oh
aunt
mary
if
the
next
trial
should
fail
the
house
is
so
frightfully
still
the
following
day
she
took
little
louis
out
to
see
philip
the
two
played
beautifully
together
but
mammy
cely
looked
at
him
askance
her
race
is
always
on
the
lookout
for
poor
white
trash
no
he
look
lak
philip
she
said
he
got
the
favor
of
some
chile
i
seen
but
it
ai
philip
he
went
with
her
one
day
to
see
his
mother
it
brought
quick
tears
to
margaret
eyes
to
witness
the
meeting
she
came
back
full
of
pity
for
the
sick
girl
aunt
mary
i
do
believe
she
is
as
old
as
i
am
so
young
to
die
and
she
is
so
gentle
and
she
says
she
has
no
relatives
at
all
to
leave
him
to
her
husband
died
when
louis
was
a
year
old
and
i
think
she
said
that
neither
her
husband
nor
herself
had
brother
or
sister
poor
little
tot
he
is
literally
alone
in
the
world
and
the
world
so
big
aunt
mary
i
think
i
will
have
to
do
it
she
rather
feared
opposition
from
judge
kirtley
but
somewhat
to
her
surprise
he
acquiesced
in
the
proposed
plan
without
remonstrance
your
money
is
your
own
and
so
is
your
life
he
told
her
you
are
a
woman
now
accountable
to
nobody
to
pennybacker
he
said
afterwards
i
am
far
from
feeling
sure
about
the
outcome
of
it
all
we
are
doing
all
we
can
but
these
things
are
always
uncertain
if
it
should
go
against
her
it
will
be
a
good
thing
for
her
to
have
this
child
the
next
visit
to
the
home
decided
her
a
lady
from
chevy
chase
had
been
there
looking
for
a
little
boy
she
had
her
eye
on
louis
lesseur
i
told
her
reported
the
matron
that
we
had
given
the
refusal
of
him
to
another
lady
margaret
brows
came
together
in
a
quick
frown
this
seemed
like
bargaining
for
flesh
and
blood
if
you
could
make
your
decision
soon
i
will
make
it
now
she
said
i
am
ready
to
take
him
at
any
time
but
when
she
got
home
pennybacker
objected
strongly
to
the
suddenness
of
her
decision
go
and
see
the
mother
margaret
and
insist
upon
a
history
of
the
family
do
think
of
taking
him
without
that
caution
is
stronger
at
sixty
than
at
i
shall
take
him
whatever
the
family
history
is
yes
i
know
it
is
a
responsibility
and
so
is
not
taking
him
he
will
soon
be
a
motherless
child
and
my
arms
are
empty
aunt
mary
she
went
on
thoughtfully
i
never
used
to
think
about
these
things
as
i
do
now
but
i
can
not
see
a
helpless
child
these
days
without
my
whole
heart
going
out
to
him
is
it
because
i
am
older
or
is
it
philip
it
is
philip
margaret
this
is
the
way
god
takes
to
enlarge
our
sympathies
the
true
mother
heart
can
take
in
more
than
her
own
no
i
know
it
but
all
women
who
have
borne
children
are
not
true
mothers
and
sometimes
the
very
essence
of
maternity
bubbles
up
in
the
heart
of
one
who
has
never
found
a
mate
and
there
is
another
thing
when
sorrow
sits
at
our
fireside
and
talks
with
us
it
always
leaves
us
with
a
quicker
ear
to
catch
what
she
has
said
to
others
i
doubt
if
you
could
comprehend
this
poor
mother
anxieties
if
you
were
not
yourself
acquainted
with
grief
she
smiled
to
herself
an
hour
later
as
margaret
drove
off
to
the
hospital
eager
for
the
interview
that
would
settle
the
matter
for
taking
her
out
of
herself
she
said
this
is
almost
equal
to
the
whirl
of
society
to
a
little
white
bed
in
the
hospital
ward
margaret
went
upon
it
a
young
girl
beautiful
even
with
death
seal
upon
her
face
half
lay
half
sat
propped
up
with
pillows
her
eyes
from
the
contrast
with
her
white
face
seeming
preternaturally
bright
there
was
a
feverish
eagerness
of
speech
battling
with
a
shortness
of
breath
as
she
received
margaret
which
told
its
little
tale
of
the
flaring
up
of
life
flame
but
back
of
that
was
a
natural
vivacity
and
profuseness
of
gesture
even
in
her
weakness
that
hinted
at
gallic
blood
the
ward
was
a
lonely
one
over
its
portals
a
practiced
eye
could
read
all
hope
abandon
ye
who
enter
here
its
inmates
went
out
sometimes
but
they
never
returned
a
few
beds
away
an
old
woman
moaned
monotonously
she
was
near
enough
to
have
heard
their
conversation
but
the
sands
of
life
were
running
so
low
that
hearing
was
dulled
and
curiosity
blotted
out
it
was
a
safe
place
to
talk
if
one
had
anything
to
say
margaret
news
that
a
home
had
been
secured
for
little
louis
was
received
with
manifest
relief
and
is
it
a
good
woman
that
has
taken
him
the
mother
asked
clasping
her
hands
will
she
be
good
to
him
will
she
teach
him
to
be
good
i
am
sure
she
will
try
to
do
both
said
margaret
she
felt
a
disinclination
to
tell
the
girl
just
yet
that
she
herself
was
the
one
who
was
to
take
him
she
would
find
out
from
her
the
story
of
her
life
first
and
then
tell
her
but
she
is
anxious
to
know
something
more
about
the
child
would
she
found
it
difficult
to
phrase
her
sentence
would
you
be
willing
to
tell
this
lady
through
me
something
of
your
life
my
life
faltered
the
girl
her
eyes
growing
frightened
why
why
does
she
want
to
know
about
my
life
her
friends
think
that
she
should
know
something
of
the
little
boy
antecedents
it
was
pennybacker
word
not
hers
no
do
not
misunderstand
me
a
slight
flush
had
crept
into
the
sick
face
it
is
not
idle
curiosity
nor
is
it
that
she
doubts
you
this
lady
wishes
to
know
enough
to
satisfy
the
child
when
in
after
years
he
begins
to
want
to
know
something
about
his
own
history
there
is
pardon
me
i
feel
that
i
must
ask
there
is
no
blot
of
any
kind
upon
his
name
her
own
face
crimsoned
as
she
put
the
question
but
it
was
one
that
pennybacker
insisted
must
be
asked
and
indeed
as
she
talked
to
the
sick
girl
now
she
felt
herself
that
she
must
ask
it
a
child
taken
from
a
home
so
often
had
suspicion
cast
upon
its
parentage
the
greatest
kindness
she
could
do
him
was
to
have
a
plain
answer
to
a
direct
question
cruel
though
it
seemed
the
sick
girl
lay
very
still
when
at
last
she
spoke
she
looked
into
margaret
face
and
answered
there
is
no
blot
upon
his
name
her
breath
was
labored
she
put
her
hand
once
to
her
throat
then
summoning
her
strength
she
went
on
rapidly
he
was
born
in
lawful
wedlock
his
father
was
a
carpenter
a
plain
man
but
an
honorable
one
he
died
when
louis
was
a
year
old
of
pneumonia
we
were
poor
but
have
always
been
respectable
i
am
very
glad
to
know
this
said
margaret
filled
with
contrition
at
having
forced
her
to
say
it
i
hope
you
will
not
misunderstand
my
asking
about
it
the
friends
of
this
lady
are
more
importunate
about
this
thing
than
she
is
and
ask
me
anything
you
wish
said
the
woman
in
a
voice
strangely
quiet
and
contained
i
was
only
distressed
for
breath
a
moment
ago
i
can
tell
you
anything
now
some
other
time
said
margaret
rising
she
could
see
that
the
strength
had
been
overtaxed
i
will
go
now
and
see
about
the
little
boy
being
taken
to
his
new
home
and
the
thought
of
what
it
must
be
to
the
girl
to
feel
that
another
would
take
her
place
rushed
over
her
let
me
promise
you
for
his
new
mother
that
she
will
strive
to
make
him
all
that
you
would
have
him
all
that
you
would
have
made
him
had
you
been
spared
to
him
honorable
like
his
father
pure
and
true
as
his
mother
oh
madam
the
sick
girl
cried
and
caught
her
dress
oh
madam
but
margaret
gently
disengaged
herself
and
was
gone
at
the
office
she
stopped
a
moment
to
ask
some
questions
about
lesseur
ah
yes
poor
rosalie
the
doctor
said
she
talked
longer
with
him
than
she
intended
it
was
just
a
question
of
time
he
said
and
not
a
very
long
time
either
no
it
was
not
tuberculosis
though
it
seemed
something
like
it
it
was
a
form
of
bright
disease
with
that
malady
people
sometimes
simply
faded
away
it
was
probable
that
she
would
go
that
way
ah
he
was
very
glad
to
know
that
a
place
had
been
found
for
the
child
she
had
worried
so
about
that
as
margaret
was
stepping
into
her
carriage
an
attendant
came
hastily
down
the
steps
and
spoke
to
her
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
but
are
you
not
the
lady
who
has
been
visiting
lesseur
in
ward
five
i
am
the
nurse
has
just
been
down
to
say
that
her
patient
is
very
desirous
of
seeing
you
a
moment
before
you
go
upon
a
matter
of
some
moment
i
believe
very
well
i
will
go
back
rogers
you
may
wait
at
the
door
of
the
ward
the
nurse
said
to
her
you
had
scarcely
gone
madam
before
she
seemed
in
great
distress
and
bade
me
call
you
back
i
think
there
was
something
she
had
forgotten
to
say
oh
no
it
will
not
hurt
her
to
talk
and
again
at
the
little
white
bed
margaret
sat
down
the
girl
had
her
eyes
closed
and
her
lips
moved
as
if
in
prayer
or
preparation
for
something
she
had
to
say
rosalie
said
margaret
gently
with
a
sudden
impulse
using
the
first
name
was
there
something
you
wanted
to
say
to
me
the
girl
wrung
her
hands
my
poor
child
what
is
it
talk
freely
to
me
as
you
would
to
a
sister
oh
madam
it
breaks
my
heart
to
have
you
speak
so
tenderly
i
i
am
not
worthy
of
it
i
am
not
fit
to
touch
your
hand
i
i
told
you
falsely
when
i
said
there
was
no
blot
upon
my
little
louis
name
oh
madam
do
not
turn
away
from
him
he
is
innocent
though
he
is
the
child
of
shame
chapter
xxx
not
wisely
but
too
well
oh
it
was
pitiful
in
the
whole
city
full
friend
she
had
none
the
child
of
shame
margaret
drew
back
she
was
not
prepared
for
this
neither
was
she
prepared
when
the
test
came
to
take
into
her
home
and
her
life
a
little
waif
upon
whom
this
blight
had
fallen
so
little
do
we
know
ourselves
the
girl
her
understanding
quickened
by
her
anguish
of
mind
saw
the
gesture
and
interpreted
it
aright
you
cast
him
off
she
cried
oh
i
knew
you
would
that
is
why
i
told
you
falsely
i
did
not
mean
to
tell
you
the
truth
ever
but
oh
madam
when
you
said
that
she
this
lady
would
make
him
honorable
as
his
father
had
been
would
keep
him
pure
as
his
mother
was
pure
and
true
as
both
had
proved
i
felt
that
it
was
a
curse
i
had
drawn
down
upon
his
helpless
head
then
oh
then
i
could
not
keep
back
the
truth
his
father
was
not
honorable
nor
his
mother
pure
rosalie
said
margaret
calming
the
girl
with
the
quiet
womanliness
of
her
manner
do
you
want
to
tell
me
your
story
is
it
this
that
you
have
brought
me
back
to
hear
yes
oh
yes
let
me
tell
it
before
you
judge
me
it
is
for
the
sake
that
i
lied
it
is
for
his
sake
that
i
will
speak
the
truth
now
oh
it
is
the
truth
that
i
will
tell
you
now
go
on
said
margaret
eight
years
ago
the
sick
girl
said
mournfully
only
eight
years
i
was
little
rosalie
lesseur
beaumont
we
were
french
enough
to
have
the
names
though
we
had
always
lived
in
maryland
my
home
was
in
the
country
i
knew
nothing
about
the
city
and
its
wickedness
i
was
but
a
child
when
i
met
she
looked
up
appealingly
i
need
not
tell
you
his
name
no
said
margaret
hastily
there
is
no
need
that
i
should
know
the
sick
girl
threw
her
a
quick
glance
of
gratitude
it
is
a
thing
most
passing
strange
that
when
a
woman
finds
herself
betrayed
disgraced
branded
with
shame
and
thrust
out
into
that
utter
darkness
from
which
she
knows
there
can
never
be
recall
even
then
she
holds
inviolate
the
name
of
him
who
has
brought
her
low
i
think
if
i
had
had
a
mother
to
tell
me
things
it
might
have
been
different
but
i
had
lived
most
of
my
life
with
my
father
a
proud
cold
man
who
loved
me
perhaps
but
did
not
let
me
know
it
though
he
robbed
himself
of
the
very
necessaries
of
life
that
he
might
educate
me
i
was
to
be
a
teacher
that
was
his
ambition
and
mine
there
was
no
confidence
between
us
i
could
not
get
close
to
him
as
a
child
does
to
its
mother
i
met
this
man
when
i
was
off
at
school
he
was
so
different
from
the
country
boys
i
had
known
he
had
a
way
of
looking
in
my
eyes
and
saying
things
that
took
my
simple
silly
heart
by
storm
i
do
not
offer
it
in
excuse
but
madam
i
loved
him
as
i
had
never
loved
my
god
i
trusted
him
as
though
he
my
god
and
when
he
told
me
that
he
loved
me
and
wanted
me
to
be
his
wife
i
believed
him
he
could
not
marry
me
openly
just
now
he
said
but
if
i
would
go
with
him
to
washington
we
would
be
married
secretly
that
very
day
i
was
an
honest
girl
though
a
very
foolish
one
and
i
insisted
on
that
i
trusted
him
to
my
undoing
there
was
a
form
of
marriage
a
young
man
came
to
our
room
and
murmured
something
as
we
stood
before
him
he
did
not
look
like
a
minister
but
i
was
so
dazed
and
frightened
at
what
i
had
done
that
i
hardly
thought
of
it
then
madam
we
were
never
married
my
husband
for
so
i
believed
him
told
me
so
one
day
in
a
fit
of
anger
told
me
brutally
margaret
gripped
the
iron
rail
of
the
bed
that
day
i
took
the
last
cent
of
money
i
had
and
went
back
to
my
father
house
it
had
been
a
bitter
grief
to
him
that
i
had
brought
his
gray
hairs
to
shame
he
shut
his
door
upon
me
oh
madam
i
begged
my
way
then
back
to
washington
and
the
man
who
had
betrayed
me
and
begged
him
to
take
me
in
what
else
could
i
do
i
lived
with
him
in
open
sin
until
he
came
to
me
one
day
and
told
me
that
it
was
all
over
he
was
to
be
married
the
next
day
he
had
delayed
telling
me
because
he
hated
to
have
a
scene
but
he
had
decided
now
to
settle
down
and
live
a
correct
life
i
i
cried
standing
up
before
him
am
i
to
do
i
and
your
child
while
you
are
leading
a
correct
life
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
would
give
me
money
that
was
all
he
could
do
certainly
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
expect
he
had
not
asked
me
to
come
back
to
him
oh
madam
i
was
wild
was
wild
i
had
nowhere
to
go
to
hide
my
shame
my
father
house
was
closed
to
me
my
mother
dead
in
all
the
world
i
had
no
friend
it
was
my
fault
my
grievous
fault
i
know
that
well
and
then
i
have
been
told
it
often
since
if
i
had
been
a
modest
girl
and
staid
at
home
and
turned
away
from
all
his
tales
of
love
and
all
his
promises
this
never
would
have
come
to
me
they
said
oh
i
have
told
myself
that
many
times
with
bitterest
tears
but
lady
even
though
she
knows
it
is
her
fault
her
sin
that
has
brought
her
to
this
plight
still
is
hard
for
a
poor
girl
to
feel
her
pains
upon
her
and
know
she
has
no
friends
margaret
took
the
woman
thin
trembling
hand
between
her
two
strong
ones
and
held
it
close
it
hard
she
said
with
infinite
gentleness
hard
and
very
pitiful
the
world
is
full
of
hard
things
for
women
the
sick
girl
looked
up
with
a
startled
expression
surely
sin
with
its
sorrows
has
not
touched
you
my
poor
girl
the
sorrows
that
come
from
sin
do
not
stop
with
the
sinning
but
go
on
with
your
story
said
margaret
oh
yes
i
was
telling
you
why
i
was
so
desperate
that
day
i
thought
you
would
not
understand
i
think
a
madness
was
in
my
blood
you
see
it
was
very
hard
and
i
was
so
young
i
could
not
see
the
justice
of
it
i
had
been
his
toy
his
plaything
and
now
broken
and
useless
he
cast
me
into
the
mire
of
the
street
while
he
and
lady
my
sin
had
been
his
sin
too
he
would
marry
a
pure
girl
such
as
i
had
been
and
the
world
would
look
on
and
wish
him
joy
and
think
it
right
he
had
not
told
me
where
the
marriage
was
to
be
nor
who
the
girl
was
but
the
next
morning
i
went
to
his
home
and
waited
in
a
place
near
by
for
him
to
come
out
i
did
not
mean
to
speak
to
him
again
only
to
follow
him
for
hours
i
waited
i
was
faint
from
lack
of
food
but
i
was
afraid
to
leave
the
spot
for
fear
of
missing
him
at
last
a
gentleman
came
out
and
drove
off
and
then
the
man
i
loved
and
hated
a
carriage
was
waiting
and
he
was
driven
away
i
ran
after
it
i
would
have
hired
a
cab
only
i
had
no
money
i
could
not
run
so
very
fast
you
know
and
sometimes
i
almost
stumbled
and
fell
then
caught
myself
and
hurried
on
and
though
it
gained
on
me
i
kept
my
eye
on
the
carriage
at
sixteenth
street
it
turned
south
toward
the
square
and
then
i
knew
it
was
going
to
st
john
st
john
yes
you
know
the
place
it
is
near
lafayette
square
the
old
church
with
the
columns
in
front
when
i
got
there
out
of
breath
and
almost
dead
from
running
a
crowd
was
on
the
sidewalk
and
even
out
into
the
street
waiting
for
the
bridal
party
to
come
out
they
would
have
crowded
around
the
very
door
but
that
policemen
kept
them
back
i
elbowed
my
way
through
them
and
was
so
desperate
and
violent
that
they
made
way
for
me
thinking
i
was
some
crazy
woman
as
indeed
i
almost
think
myself
i
was
as
i
reached
the
door
a
policeman
caught
me
by
the
arm
but
i
jerked
away
and
cried
go
in
he
is
my
husband
mine
and
then
i
beat
upon
the
door
before
they
could
stop
me
and
screamed
again
is
my
husband
at
that
they
overpowered
me
and
dragged
me
off
somewhere
i
do
know
to
the
station
i
believe
that
night
my
baby
was
born
how
old
is
your
child
asked
margaret
her
voice
so
strained
and
hard
that
the
sick
woman
looked
up
surprised
six
years
have
i
tired
you
with
my
story
i
did
not
mean
to
be
so
long
go
on
it
interests
me
deeply
answered
margaret
with
irony
unnoticed
by
the
sick
woman
i
am
learning
that
we
all
are
bound
up
in
one
another
woes
and
wickedness
after
a
moment
she
asked
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
and
was
no
voice
lifted
to
save
this
girl
i
can
not
tell
i
never
saw
her
do
not
know
her
name
or
where
she
lived
but
this
i
know
that
in
time
he
would
be
false
to
her
as
he
was
false
to
me
it
was
not
in
him
to
be
let
us
not
talk
of
him
said
margaret
hastily
tell
me
about
yourself
how
did
you
live
oh
madam
ask
me
anything
but
that
break
my
heart
to
tell
that
tale
and
yours
to
hear
it
how
can
a
poor
girl
live
who
has
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
not
a
friend
i
went
from
door
to
door
asking
for
work
it
was
the
same
old
story
everywhere
i
went
they
looked
at
me
a
girl
of
seventeen
and
at
the
child
and
then
they
shook
their
heads
and
closed
the
door
one
day
when
i
was
desperate
i
got
a
piece
of
crepe
and
put
it
on
my
hat
and
i
said
my
husband
had
been
killed
and
would
they
give
a
poor
girl
work
the
child
was
good
he
seldom
cried
i
told
them
and
i
would
work
at
night
and
have
no
afternoon
off
to
make
up
for
his
being
there
if
only
they
would
try
me
then
they
asked
me
questions
what
was
my
husband
name
where
was
he
killed
and
how
simple
natural
questions
all
of
them
i
know
now
but
then
they
seemed
traps
to
catch
me
and
i
grew
confused
and
tripped
myself
and
then
they
shook
their
heads
just
as
before
and
shut
the
door
did
you
never
try
anything
but
housework
oh
yes
i
tried
the
others
first
they
would
not
have
me
in
the
stores
they
found
out
somehow
i
could
not
help
their
finding
out
i
do
know
how
they
did
it
but
they
did
there
was
always
somebody
to
tell
and
could
you
get
no
sewing
to
do
i
had
never
been
taught
to
sew
i
had
been
in
school
until
i
met
him
it
was
the
plan
always
that
i
should
be
a
teacher
of
course
i
could
not
even
think
of
that
afterwards
margaret
lips
tightened
why
did
you
not
go
to
him
this
man
she
cried
with
sudden
vehemence
and
demand
support
for
your
child
i
did
at
last
in
my
fierce
anger
that
day
i
had
said
i
never
would
that
i
would
starve
in
the
streets
before
i
would
take
a
penny
from
his
hands
but
madam
i
did
not
know
how
hard
be
to
starve
with
a
baby
at
your
breast
a
helpless
baby
growing
thinner
day
by
day
for
lack
of
mother
milk
that
had
dried
up
because
she
had
no
food
it
is
not
so
hard
this
starving
for
one
self
when
you
get
used
to
the
crusts
and
refuse
from
the
market
but
when
your
child
your
baby
fades
away
and
has
not
strength
to
cry
and
gets
that
pitiful
pinched
look
and
you
realize
that
it
too
is
starving
oh
madam
then
your
pride
is
gone
i
went
to
him
and
begged
food
for
his
child
he
gave
me
money
for
awhile
and
then
he
went
away
went
away
and
left
you
helpless
breathed
margaret
he
left
me
desperate
was
then
i
had
my
hardest
fight
oh
madam
i
sometimes
wonder
if
good
women
know
the
sheltered
favored
ones
who
will
not
have
us
in
their
homes
after
our
one
false
step
how
hard
it
is
then
for
us
to
keep
from
going
down
they
surely
can
not
know
how
we
are
tempted
by
our
poverty
and
want
of
work
you
see
there
are
so
many
pitfalls
for
our
feet
oh
there
are
hands
held
out
the
hands
that
drag
us
down
and
doors
that
open
but
they
are
the
gates
of
hell
she
sank
back
exhausted
but
after
a
moment
she
went
on
madam
i
was
often
hungry
in
those
days
was
oftener
cold
and
sometimes
had
not
where
to
lay
my
head
but
i
swear
to
you
i
kept
myself
from
evil
for
my
child
and
kept
my
then
one
day
a
fever
fell
upon
me
and
some
ladies
came
and
took
my
baby
to
the
children
home
and
me
to
the
hospital
it
was
typhoid
fever
caused
by
unsanitary
food
the
doctor
said
you
see
when
one
is
starving
she
can
not
stop
to
ask
if
this
or
that
is
sanitary
so
long
as
it
is
food
and
for
many
weeks
i
lay
delirious
i
was
just
ready
to
be
discharged
from
the
hospital
when
one
day
i
read
in
the
paper
that
this
man
had
come
back
to
washington
i
laid
the
paper
down
and
thought
long
and
hard
i
knew
that
he
was
wealthy
had
money
that
he
could
not
use
was
said
i
determined
to
go
to
him
and
ask
him
once
for
all
to
settle
on
me
or
his
child
a
sum
sufficient
to
support
us
in
a
humble
way
oh
a
humble
way
only
so
that
i
could
have
my
baby
with
me
and
be
sure
of
bread
you
do
not
think
that
was
too
much
to
ask
no
no
i
went
straight
to
him
from
the
hospital
i
think
perhaps
i
was
not
quite
myself
though
i
seemed
well
the
doctor
here
tells
me
i
have
asked
him
since
that
often
typhoid
leaves
a
patient
for
months
in
a
bewildered
state
of
mind
insanity
i
think
they
call
it
and
i
do
not
know
but
i
have
thought
that
perhaps
perhaps
it
was
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
vacancy
a
wistful
troubled
look
in
them
as
if
forgetful
of
her
auditor
she
were
laboring
upon
some
unsolved
problem
you
found
him
in
asked
margaret
gently
recalling
her
oh
yes
yes
i
found
him
in
he
was
sitting
at
his
desk
she
stopped
abruptly
margaret
was
leaning
forward
one
hand
clutching
the
rail
of
the
iron
bed
the
other
clenched
in
her
lap
go
on
she
said
hoarsely
the
sick
woman
looked
at
her
and
a
swift
change
passed
over
her
face
a
look
almost
of
veiled
cunning
coming
into
it
he
would
do
nothing
for
me
she
resumed
in
a
commonplace
voice
i
never
saw
him
again
he
died
soon
afterwards
i
heard
the
subject
seemed
finished
just
one
thing
more
margaret
lips
were
dry
she
hardly
knew
her
own
voice
did
did
he
die
a
natural
death
or
by
violence
for
just
a
moment
the
woman
hesitated
it
was
as
if
she
were
weighing
her
words
then
she
said
quietly
he
died
a
natural
death
margaret
drew
a
long
long
breath
tell
me
something
about
your
little
boy
she
said
almost
lightly
a
tenderness
came
into
the
woman
wan
face
at
mention
of
him
i
named
him
louis
louis
lesseur
that
was
my
mother
name
and
louis
is
for
my
little
brother
that
died
i
could
not
give
him
even
my
own
name
my
father
was
so
bitter
but
these
two
were
dead
and
is
he
very
dear
to
you
your
little
son
dear
o
madam
he
is
the
very
breath
of
life
to
me
and
yet
you
can
not
have
him
with
you
no
she
said
it
very
patiently
the
rules
of
both
hospital
and
home
forbid
but
sometimes
they
bring
him
to
me
for
a
little
while
as
the
sad
story
to
which
she
had
listened
had
progressed
a
determination
had
been
taking
form
in
margaret
de
jarnette
mind
she
bent
over
now
and
speaking
slowly
that
the
sick
woman
might
take
in
her
words
said
and
would
it
make
you
very
happy
if
you
could
have
him
all
the
time
if
you
could
lie
upon
a
couch
in
some
pleasant
sunny
room
a
quiet
house
we
say
where
you
would
not
be
disturbed
could
have
your
little
louis
in
this
room
with
you
every
day
to
talk
to
you
and
lean
against
you
as
he
talks
to
have
his
playthings
on
the
floor
and
play
that
you
and
he
were
this
and
that
perhaps
sometimes
when
you
were
very
well
even
to
have
his
crib
bed
in
your
room
and
tuck
him
in
and
watch
him
go
to
sleep
could
have
his
goodnight
kiss
and
hear
him
say
his
prayers
she
drew
the
picture
with
the
swift
sure
strokes
that
mothers
know
if
you
could
have
all
this
and
know
that
it
would
last
until
some
night
you
fall
asleep
to
waken
on
your
breast
would
it
make
you
very
happy
the
woman
looked
at
her
with
parted
lips
and
shining
eyes
oh
madam
it
would
be
heaven
then
enter
into
paradise
margaret
said
softly
you
mean
the
sick
girl
asked
incredulously
i
mean
that
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
my
home
if
you
will
go
and
let
you
have
your
little
louis
with
you
there
the
woman
caught
her
hand
and
kissed
it
passionately
then
with
quick
alarm
she
asked
but
madam
the
lady
would
she
be
willing
for
him
to
come
to
me
margaret
smiled
she
will
be
willing
another
fear
assailed
the
mother
perhaps
she
will
not
want
to
take
him
when
she
knows
his
mother
sin
she
will
hold
him
all
the
more
tenderly
because
of
what
his
mother
has
suffered
ah
is
she
then
so
good
so
kind
she
is
not
very
good
said
margaret
smiling
down
at
her
but
to
your
boy
she
promises
she
will
never
be
anything
but
kind
my
poor
girl
will
you
trust
her
a
sudden
light
broke
upon
the
sick
woman
you
she
cried
you
who
heard
it
all
and
took
my
hand
and
understood
you
a
look
of
awe
and
then
of
peace
ineffable
stole
over
her
face
oh
madam
i
know
god
has
forgiven
me

a

crusade
margaret
action
in
taking
a
dying
woman
into
her
home
that
she
might
give
her
the
blessedness
of
being
with
her
child
while
life
lasted
excited
little
comment
indeed
it
was
known
to
but
few
persons
social
life
in
the
capital
city
is
an
unstable
thing
congressional
circles
change
army
and
navy
people
move
away
there
are
the
ins
and
the
outs
with
every
administration
and
fortunes
rise
and
fall
there
as
elsewhere
margaret
found
her
world
greatly
narrowed
when
she
came
back
to
washington
after
years
of
absence
besides
the
few
friends
who
were
closest
to
her
had
become
accustomed
now
to
expect
the
unusual
it
is
the
beauty
of
an
unconventional
life
which
keeps
within
the
proprieties
that
when
one
has
made
it
definitely
clear
that
she
intends
to
follow
her
own
lead
she
finds
herself
by
that
act
lifted
above
the
realm
of
harassing
criticism
margaret
had
not
felt
it
necessary
to
take
even
her
own
small
world
into
her
confidence
we
wo
say
anything
to
maria
about
it
advised
pennybacker
she
would
understand
it
and
besides
what
maria
knows
might
just
as
well
be
put
in
the
evening
papers
she
gives
of
her
knowledge
without
stint
the
servants
knew
lesseur
as
a
sick
friend
of
de
jarnette
bess
as
an
unfortunate
woman
who
had
excited
sympathies
because
of
her
friendless
widowed
condition
that
is
enough
for
any
young
girl
to
know
said
pennybacker
to
whom
margaret
had
told
the
whole
story
we
tell
harcourt
the
same
judge
kirtley
was
a
little
inclined
to
question
the
wisdom
of
burdening
herself
with
a
dying
woman
but
pennybacker
had
said
to
him
impressively
judge
kirtley
the
time
has
come
when
you
and
i
may
well
off
the
shoes
from
off
our
feet
for
the
place
whereon
we
stand
is
holy
ground
the
lord
is
leading
margaret
in
ways
we
do
not
know
and
the
judge
said
no
more
watching
the
girl
closely
he
halfway
thought
it
was
true
two
rooms
in
the
third
story
where
she
could
be
quiet
and
have
the
sunlight
were
prepared
for
rosalie
lesseur
there
she
and
a
discreet
nurse
were
installed
and
there
she
lay
basking
in
the
sunshine
of
her
child
presence
and
the
knowledge
that
all
was
well
she
had
not
even
questioned
them
about
whose
house
she
was
entering
it
was
enough
that
it
was
her
chamber
of
peace
it
happened
that
the
day
after
she
was
settled
here
bess
came
into
the
room
with
a
big
bunch
of
yellow
daisies
which
she
laid
in
lap
for
osborne
with
harcourt
compliments
she
said
will
she
tell
him
what
they
recall
to
her
give
him
osborne
thanks
said
margaret
smiling
at
his
message
and
tell
him
they
remind
her
strikingly
of
the
susans
of
south
haven
from
this
rosalie
lesseur
naturally
supposed
that
her
benefactress
was
osborne
she
called
her
so
once
to
the
nurse
who
had
also
seen
the
flowers
presented
and
that
judicious
person
who
was
taciturn
by
nature
and
prudent
by
profession
did
not
see
fit
to
undeceive
her
perhaps
de
jarnette
had
some
reason
for
wishing
to
be
known
as
osborne
it
was
no
part
of
her
business
to
talk
and
since
rosalie
with
a
trace
of
inherited
frenchiness
always
addressed
margaret
as
madam
or
lady
sometimes
sweet
lady
dear
lady
her
misapprehension
in
regard
to
the
name
was
never
discovered
everything
that
could
be
done
for
the
sick
girl
comfort
was
done
the
child
came
in
and
out
at
will
he
was
a
sweet
lovable
boy
gentle
like
his
mother
and
easily
led
when
the
two
children
were
together
it
was
always
philip
that
took
the
lead
margaret
took
him
often
with
her
in
her
visits
to
elmhurst
thinking
it
was
well
for
philip
to
have
intercourse
with
other
children
it
added
greatly
to
the
happiness
of
both
but
mammy
cely
was
never
quite
reconciled
to
the
intimacy
you
ca
never
tell
nothin
these
here
she
would
say
rosalie
was
very
responsive
to
kindness
never
having
had
a
surfeit
of
it
and
was
so
grateful
for
everything
done
for
her
that
it
was
easy
to
keep
on
doing
margaret
fell
into
the
habit
of
being
much
with
her
reading
to
her
sitting
beside
her
with
her
sewing
talking
sometimes
but
often
simply
giving
her
the
comfort
of
her
presence
and
receiving
ah
well
nobody
can
give
of
herself
as
margaret
gave
and
not
receive
in
return
good
measure
pressed
down
and
running
over
pennybacker
too
was
kind
and
motherly
her
hand
often
rested
on
the
girl
forehead
with
the
line
on
her
lips
unspoken
was
so
young
and
then
she
had
no
bess
and
the
little
boy
were
the
greatest
friends
and
took
long
walks
together
often
going
to
the
zoo
because
the
child
of
course
was
fond
of
seeing
the
animals
and
bess
was
but
another
child
harcourt
frequently
accompanied
them
upon
these
tramps
to
take
care
of
the
children
he
said
but
with
the
responsibility
of
the
little
boy
upon
her
bess
really
seemed
quite
womanly
looking
after
him
with
a
little
assumption
of
motherliness
that
was
extremely
pretty
john
harcourt
used
to
think
he
watched
her
while
she
watched
the
animals
in
all
these
weeks
there
was
never
a
reference
to
rosalie
past
that
page
is
turned
rosalie
margaret
had
told
her
one
day
when
she
made
some
depreciating
reference
to
herself
let
us
never
speak
of
it
again
she
said
it
with
a
gentle
firmness
that
was
final
and
from
that
hour
rosalie
lesseur
looked
at
her
with
worshipful
eyes
the
creature
comforts
with
which
she
was
surrounded
the
material
kindness
which
had
been
showered
upon
her
the
blessedness
of
again
having
her
child
in
her
arms
all
these
were
enough
to
awaken
deepest
gratitude
but
what
could
be
said
of
a
magnanimity
a
compassion
which
blotted
out
her
transgressions
and
loved
her
freely
it
is
related
of
the
nurse
of
the
crimea
that
the
sick
soldiers
turned
to
kiss
her
shadow
as
it
passed
rosalie
could
have
fallen
at
margaret
feet
and
kissed
the
hem
of
her
garment
but
that
she
felt
her
unworthiness
one
afternoon
they
were
sitting
in
her
room
pennybacker
and
margaret
doing
the
talking
and
the
sick
girl
listening
she
never
talked
much
herself
but
she
liked
to
hear
them
she
was
feeling
unusually
bright
that
day
and
looked
actually
happy
for
the
conversation
was
about
philip
and
louis
and
the
rapidly
approaching
christmas
it
almost
seemed
that
god
peace
was
settling
upon
her
face
we
will
have
a
little
for
louis
in
here
margaret
was
saying
just
then
a
servant
appeared
at
the
door
with
a
card
a
lady
to
see
de
jarnette
margaret
looked
at
the
card
mary
s
belden
what
in
the
world
does
she
want
i
wonder
you
are
sure
she
asked
for
me
yes
madam
she
distinctly
said
de
jarnette
tell
her
i
will
be
down
at
once
who
is
mary
s
belden
asked
pennybacker
a
lady
who
is
quite
prominent
here
in
club
circles
women
clubs
i
mean
i
used
to
know
her
slightly
but
i
have
seen
her
since
been
back
oh
she
probably
wants
to
get
you
into
some
club
and
margaret
suppose
you
join
i
think
it
would
be
very
pleasant
for
you
it
gives
one
an
interest
outside
her
own
life
pennybacker
had
followed
margaret
to
the
door
when
she
returned
rosalie
had
slipped
from
the
pillows
and
was
lying
in
a
dead
faint
the
nurse
was
hastily
summoned
and
restoratives
applied
oh
she
said
faintly
as
consciousness
came
back
if
i
could
have
gone
then
it
was
only
a
sinking
spell
the
nurse
said
soothingly
adding
to
pennybacker
in
an
aside
she
is
liable
to
have
them
at
any
time
now
well
what
did
mary
belden
want
it
was
in
the
library
a
half
hour
later
to
secure
you
for
her
club
no
said
margaret
she
came
to
tell
me
of
a
meeting
to
be
held
the
last
of
the
week
in
the
interest
of
some
or
other
and
to
see
if
she
could
secure
my
what
movement
oh
i
do
know
i
declined
so
promptly
that
she
had
no
chance
to
tell
me
i
think
i
offended
her
but
i
ca
help
it
i
have
no
patience
with
all
these
women
meetings
pennybacker
pursed
her
lips
but
said
nothing
everybody
must
have
observed
from
his
own
experience
that
when
a
new
word
or
thought
comes
to
us
with
sufficient
force
to
make
an
impression
we
invariably
run
across
that
word
or
thought
again
within
hours
and
so
often
thereafter
that
the
wonder
arises
how
we
could
have
missed
it
all
this
time
taking
up
a
the
day
after
call
margaret
saw
a
notice
of
a
meeting
to
be
addressed
by
greuze
on
a
subject
of
great
moment
to
women
walking
down
f
street
that
afternoon
with
bess
she
overheard
two
ladies
discussing
it
at
least
she
supposed
it
was
that
one
of
them
asked
are
you
going
to
the
meeting
yes
the
other
replied
it
was
made
very
clear
to
us
at
the
pro
re
nata
that
we
ought
to
do
whatever
we
could
to
help
the
movement
along
you
see
they
had
passed
and
margaret
missed
the
rest
their
destination
was
a
milliner
establishment
their
object
a
winter
hat
for
bess
the
milliner
girl
was
trying
it
on
her
and
bess
perking
her
head
this
way
and
that
like
a
bird
and
turning
it
up
down
and
around
to
find
a
possible
objection
listening
meanwhile
to
an
occasional
suggestion
from
margaret
and
a
succession
of
compliments
from
the
saleswoman
when
margaret
ear
caught
a
fragment
that
floated
to
her
from
the
other
side
of
the
store
i
do
hope
ladies
the
proprietor
a
woman
was
saying
earnestly
that
you
will
give
it
the
support
of
your
presence
at
least
the
movement
is
a
most
important
one
for
women
in
trade
the
present
laws
margaret
how
is
this
would
you
like
this
feather
tipped
a
little
more
margaret
wanted
to
hear
what
it
was
about
the
laws
but
when
the
question
of
the
feather
was
decided
the
ladies
were
gone
how
could
the
suffrage
movement
help
a
milliner
the
thing
pursued
her
even
after
she
got
home
kirtley
came
in
toward
night
for
a
call
and
said
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
margaret
do
you
know
anything
about
this
movement
the
women
are
interesting
themselves
in
so
much
just
now
delamere
was
telling
me
about
it
yesterday
but
it
was
just
as
i
was
getting
off
the
cars
and
she
had
time
to
explain
it
to
me
she
urged
me
to
go
to
the
meeting
evening
said
i
would
find
out
all
about
it
then
have
you
heard
anything
about
it
yes
said
margaret
with
some
hesitation
i
heard
of
it
but
i
really
do
know
what
it
is
i
have
an
idea
that
it
is
the
suffrage
movement
do
you
think
so
indeed
delamere
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
i
am
sure
and
she
told
me
to
drum
up
everybody
i
could
are
you
going
yes
i
think
i
shall
my
curiosity
is
a
little
aroused
now
to
see
what
the
movement
really
is
margaret
was
trying
to
recall
something
she
heard
judge
kirtley
say
one
day
about
somebody
she
was
thinking
it
was
the
suffragists
prodding
the
legislatures
up
to
a
change
of
defective
laws
she
gave
a
faint
sigh
if
only
they
would
spend
their
time
and
energies
on
laws
affecting
flesh
and
blood
instead
of
forever
harping
upon
property
rights
and
suffrage
she
felt
judge
kirtley
had
just
told
her
that
there
had
been
a
postponement
of
the
case
it
was
not
likely
to
come
to
trial
for
months
yet
the
docket
was
so
full
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
when
her
case
would
be
reached
they
could
only
be
patient
and
wait
she
felt
that
she
could
not
be
patient
any
longer
her
heart
was
sick
with
waiting
it
would
soon
be
christmas
and
she
could
not
even
have
the
child
with
her
then
that
was
a
sore
spot
she
had
written
to
de
jarnette
asking
if
philip
might
not
be
allowed
to
come
to
her
house
for
the
holidays
it
did
not
seem
to
her
that
she
could
bear
it
to
spend
that
season
which
was
so
much
to
both
of
them
without
him
she
had
planned
that
philip
and
louis
should
hang
up
their
stockings
side
by
side
in
rosalie
room
and
in
the
evening
have
their
christmas
tree
there
de
jarnette
had
replied
briefly
but
courteously
that
he
was
sorry
not
to
grant
her
request
but
for
reasons
unnecessary
to
state
it
seemed
best
that
philip
should
spend
the
holidays
at
elmhurst
he
trusted
that
she
would
feel
at
liberty
to
come
to
him
there
for
the
day
if
she
so
desired
she
tore
the
letter
into
bits
furious
at
him
for
refusing
her
request
and
at
herself
for
making
it
why
had
she
humiliated
herself
to
ask
a
favor
at
his
hands
oh
when
would
it
all
be
over
she
thought
with
a
sick
longing
for
her
boy
when
would
she
be
freed
from
this
man
iron
hand
her
heart
was
sending
up
the
old
old
cry
how
long
o
lord
how
long
margaret
said
pennybacker
the
night
of
the
meeting
dropping
a
lump
of
sugar
into
her
coffee
as
she
spoke
i
can
tell
you
the
straight
of
this
thing
now
while
i
was
over
at
maria
this
afternoon
she
had
a
call
from
a
slyter
who
had
come
to
enlist
her
in
it
i
thought
she
was
on
rather
a
cold
trail
but
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
her
so
mrs
slyter
exclaimed
margaret
wonderingly
why
slyter
is
a
society
woman
of
what
interest
could
it
be
to
her
i
do
know
but
it
has
certainly
enlisted
her
what
did
slyter
have
to
say
about
it
she
says
it
is
a
concerted
effort
on
the
part
of
the
women
clubs
of
the
district
to
have
some
radical
changes
made
in
the
laws
relating
to
women
this
lecture
is
to
call
attention
to
the
necessity
for
such
changes
in
other
words
the
speaker
is
going
to
tell
the
women
what
their
wrongs
are
they
ca
have
been
very
hard
hit
if
they
do
know
without
being
told
said
margaret
a
little
scornfully
the
fact
that
people
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
were
taking
an
interest
in
the
gathering
of
the
evening
aroused
margaret
curiosity
in
regard
to
it
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
it
inclined
her
to
look
upon
a
woman
meeting
with
more
toleration
than
she
had
ever
supposed
she
could
feel
as
pennybacker
had
said
they
certainly
must
be
in
earnest
and
earnestness
always
commands
respect
even
if
the
zeal
it
induces
is
she
would
try
to
go
with
an
unbiased
mind
but
when
they
entered
the
hall
and
she
saw
a
woman
speaker
on
the
platform
her
inherited
conservatism
asserted
itself
it
seemed
a
bold
thing
for
a
woman
to
do
she
felt
that
she
was
doing
almost
a
disreputable
thing
to
come
here
her
father
would
not
have
approved
of
it
she
was
sure
he
had
always
felt
that
home
was
the
woman
kingdom
she
could
almost
hear
him
now
saying
queens
you
must
always
be
queens
to
your
lovers
queens
to
your
husbands
and
your
sons
queens
of
higher
mystery
to
the
world
beyond
which
bows
itself
and
will
forever
bow
before
the
myrtle
crown
and
the
stainless
scepter
of
womanhood
even
though
the
speaker
was
clothed
in
soft
raiment
and
did
not
seem
at
all
masculine
she
could
not
rid
herself
of
the
feeling
that
it
was
not
a
womanly
thing
for
her
to
be
here
on
this
platform
ruskin
was
right
when
he
said
but
alas
you
are
too
often
idle
and
careless
queens
grasping
at
majesty
in
the
least
things
while
you
abdicate
it
in
the
greatest
when
greuze
began
to
speak
it
was
in
no
receptive
mood
that
margaret
listened
but
rather
in
a
spirit
of
impatient
criticism
the
thing
seemed
so
far
apart
from
life
after
a
while
she
found
herself
wondering
with
rather
a
curious
interest
what
the
speaker
would
say
next
but
with
no
spark
struck
between
them
greuze
was
telling
of
the
laws
of
the
district
in
regard
to
married
women
and
their
property
rights
their
inability
to
buy
to
sell
and
to
hold
in
their
own
right
pennybacker
was
listening
intently
that
is
as
true
as
gospel
she
whispered
in
assent
to
some
assertion
that
struck
her
as
specially
forcible
i
known
a
hundred
cases
in
missouri
where
a
woman
property
was
simply
absorbed
by
her
husband
when
she
was
married
and
if
she
wanted
five
dollars
to
give
to
the
missionary
cause
in
after
years
she
had
to
go
to
him
for
it
and
he
always
thought
he
was
making
her
a
present
of
it
margaret
smiled
with
but
languid
interest
it
might
be
that
a
man
could
by
law
claim
his
wife
wages
and
get
them
that
a
woman
was
not
entitled
legally
even
to
the
clothes
she
wore
that
was
all
very
hard
but
the
world
was
full
of
hard
things
and
why
should
she
burden
herself
with
other
people
sorrows
and
wrongs
when
she
was
powerless
to
remedy
them
she
had
enough
of
her
own
what
if
women
had
not
the
right
to
sue
or
be
sued
this
might
be
important
in
the
abstract
to
the
people
who
theorized
but
it
all
seemed
far
away
and
irrelevant
these
things
must
touch
very
few
people
she
looked
at
her
watch
thinking
that
philip
had
been
in
bed
two
hours
now
perhaps
she
would
charge
mammy
cely
to
be
very
regular
about
his
hours
and
not
let
him
and
if
it
is
true
that
a
woman
has
an
inherent
right
to
the
money
she
has
earned
to
the
property
she
has
inherited
to
the
home
she
has
labored
with
heart
and
hand
to
make
what
shall
we
say
of
her
right
to
the
child
she
has
borne
margaret
sat
up
straight
with
nerves
and
muscles
tense
as
a
button
pressed
a
thousand
miles
away
starts
all
the
ponderous
machinery
so
had
this
sentence
been
the
electric
spark
to
put
her
in
instant
touch
with
the
speaker
and
her
subject
heart
soul
and
mind
were
alert
now
and
yet
there
are
laws
in
this
district
which
impliedly
deny
that
a
mother
has
an
equal
right
with
the
father
to
those
children
more
than
this
there
are
laws
which
give
that
father
a
right
to
will
away
from
her
her
child
nay
more
even
than
that
there
are
laws
which
give
him
the
power
to
will
away
her
child
do
you
say
that
our
statutes
need
no
revision
when
this
is
where
they
place
women
in
the
closing
years
of
our
vaunted
civilization
you
do
not
believe
that
this
is
true
study
the
laws
find
out
for
yourselves
do
not
take
my
word
for
it
but
let
me
tell
you
in
verification
of
my
statement
that
there
is
pending
even
now
in
the
courts
of
this
district
just
such
a
case
a
father
willed
away
his
child
from
its
mother
and
one
court
has
sustained
the
will
you
have
not
known
of
this
my
friend
that
is
because
it
has
not
touched
you
margaret
was
staring
at
her
with
fascinated
eyes
how
had
this
woman
known
was
it
her
cause
they
were
espousing
was
this
the
touch
of
nature
that
made
the
whole
world
kin
she
heard
as
in
a
dream
greuze
closing
words
we
do
all
honor
in
this
land
of
ours
to
the
brave
men
who
have
risked
their
lives
for
their
country
the
soldier
claim
to
a
gratitude
is
sung
everywhere
sometimes
not
in
washington
we
talk
of
it
not
in
empty
words
but
in
marble
stone
and
bronze
we
build
our
soldiers
home
for
the
disabled
veterans
we
employ
armies
of
men
for
the
disbursement
of
the
millions
we
pour
willingly
at
their
feet
when
we
can
do
no
more
we
lay
them
to
rest
in
our
beautiful
city
of
the
dead
and
deck
their
graves
with
laurel
is
this
all
nay
we
have
made
the
nation
capital
a
monumental
city
raising
memorials
on
every
hand
we
forget
and
we
do
well
to
honor
them
but
after
all
how
long
does
a
battle
last
or
a
war
even
though
it
be
a
fratricidal
conflict
kept
up
until
the
flower
of
the
land
is
cut
down
and
the
rivers
run
red
with
blood
not
long
not
long
as
god
counts
time
but
oh
my
friends
there
is
somewhere
a
brave
woman
fighting
the
battle
of
maternity
in
every
minute
of
time
and
has
been
since
the
world
began
and
they
always
met
it
and
always
meet
it
gallantly
and
gladly
they
have
not
marched
into
battle
with
the
pomp
and
panoply
of
war
with
flags
flying
drums
beating
and
the
cheers
of
comrades
in
their
ears
their
fight
has
been
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
watches
and
in
the
darkened
chamber
but
a
soldier
among
them
but
has
known
that
she
faced
and
this
great
army
of
mothers
all
over
the
world
in
all
the
ages
past
and
to
come
ask
no
pensions
crave
no
honors
expect
not
even
to
have
written
over
their
modest
tombs
lies
one
who
has
fought
a
good
fight
all
they
ask
is
the
same
rights
to
children
property
and
persons
that
their
husbands
and
fathers
have
always
enjoyed
when
the
lecture
was
over
margaret
went
straight
to
the
speaker
i
am
one
the
law
has
touched
she
said
let
me
help
chapter
xxxii
margaret
enlists
the
next
day
was
the
time
for
margaret
visit
to
philip
not
once
in
all
these
months
had
she
failed
him
not
once
had
the
dawn
of
that
day
come
without
bringing
first
of
all
to
her
mind
the
thought
i
shall
see
him
this
morning
however
her
waking
thought
was
not
of
her
child
but
of
the
cause
which
she
longed
so
passionately
to
help
she
had
made
an
engagement
the
night
before
to
meet
greuze
at
her
rooms
at
ten
she
would
postpone
her
visit
to
elmhurst
till
afternoon
that
the
way
it
goes
remarked
pennybacker
caustically
as
margaret
dressed
for
the
street
announced
this
plan
as
soon
as
the
poison
of
public
life
gets
into
a
woman
veins
it
appears
first
of
all
in
her
neglect
of
her
children
at
least
that
what
they
say
i
am
not
neglecting
my
child
margaret
declared
indignantly
i
am
only
trying
to
find
out
what
i
can
do
to
help
him
i
never
had
good
more
at
heart
than
i
have
this
minute
oh
margaret
you
got
it
bad
but
the
girl
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
respond
to
bantering
you
want
to
know
what
was
the
very
beginning
of
the
movement
you
say
said
greuze
as
she
and
margaret
sat
together
in
her
rooms
well
if
this
ever
grows
to
an
oak
de
jarnette
it
will
have
come
from
a
very
small
acorn
the
people
who
started
it
had
not
the
least
idea
of
its
ever
reaching
the
proportions
of
a
bill
before
congress
i
assure
you
for
i
was
in
at
the
start
you
see
a
few
of
us
last
year
undertook
the
study
of
civics
as
applied
to
local
affairs
we
have
found
many
laws
inimical
to
women
laws
of
whose
existence
most
of
those
ladies
had
never
dreamed
judge
kirtley
used
to
say
to
me
said
margaret
the
remark
coming
back
to
her
with
new
force
that
people
seldom
know
much
about
the
laws
under
which
they
live
until
they
are
touched
by
them
that
it
exactly
we
found
laws
in
force
here
in
this
district
that
we
were
amazed
to
know
were
in
existence
that
is
to
say
most
of
the
women
knew
nothing
about
them
a
few
whose
lives
or
work
had
brought
them
into
contact
with
law
knew
to
the
rest
they
were
a
revelation
well
the
need
of
the
revision
of
these
laws
was
laid
before
the
federation
of
women
clubs
of
the
district
and
they
at
once
took
it
up
our
plan
is
this
we
want
to
get
a
bill
through
congress
to
amend
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
to
married
women
to
make
parents
the
mother
equally
with
the
father
the
natural
guardians
of
their
children
and
for
other
purposes
of
like
character
we
hope
to
have
the
bill
introduced
early
in
the
session
and
then
every
woman
in
the
city
of
washington
who
is
interested
in
its
success
must
go
to
work
how
cried
margaret
tell
me
how
i
am
ready
and
anxious
to
work
if
i
only
knew
what
to
do
in
the
first
place
we
have
to
make
friends
for
this
bill
any
woman
who
has
influence
with
any
member
of
the
senate
must
use
it
now
i
say
senate
because
it
is
to
be
introduced
there
it
will
go
to
the
house
later
we
want
if
possible
to
get
personal
pledges
from
every
senator
that
he
will
vote
for
this
bill
when
it
comes
up
do
you
know
anybody
in
the
senate
your
case
is
so
directly
in
point
that
it
ought
to
make
you
a
powerful
advocate
yes
i
have
had
a
number
of
acquaintances
in
the
senate
my
father
was
thrown
much
with
public
men
and
was
in
the
habit
of
having
them
frequently
at
his
home
then
certainly
the
position
in
which
the
present
laws
have
placed
his
orphaned
daughter
will
appeal
to
them
think
up
every
one
my
dear
that
you
could
possibly
reach
this
movement
represents
five
thousand
women
and
to
make
it
a
success
everybody
that
can
do
anything
must
go
to
work
and
these
women
are
doing
all
this
in
order
to
secure
a
mother
right
to
her
child
ejaculated
margaret
with
a
growing
sense
of
her
own
narrowness
of
vision
why
bless
you
no
returned
greuze
that
is
only
one
item
in
the
bill
that
we
shall
present
you
could
get
a
bill
through
on
that
one
point
alone
people
ca
be
depended
upon
to
work
unless
their
own
personal
interests
are
concerned
it
is
a
selfish
world
my
dear
from
greuze
margaret
went
straight
to
belden
i
thought
you
did
not
understand
that
lady
said
but
now
that
you
do
we
will
put
our
shoulders
to
the
wheel
together
there
was
inspiration
in
the
ring
of
her
voice
yes
as
greuze
has
told
you
she
went
on
our
plan
is
to
canvass
the
senate
thoroughly
and
systematically
not
in
any
aggressive
way
that
would
antagonize
we
are
not
trying
to
exploit
ourselves
but
with
a
quiet
persistency
that
will
secure
the
votes
i
am
sure
you
can
be
of
great
service
to
us
just
here
oh
i
wish
i
could
be
cried
margaret
you
see
your
case
illustrates
so
perfectly
the
atrocious
medieval
character
of
some
of
our
laws
your
story
will
only
have
to
be
told
to
furnish
the
argument
they
can
not
say
to
you
as
they
have
said
to
us
these
laws
are
a
dead
letter
in
you
my
child
we
have
a
living
witness
to
the
fact
that
they
are
a
dead
letter
soon
after
the
christmas
recess
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
you
with
me
to
call
on
senator
southard
whom
we
are
specially
anxious
to
gain
i
remember
him
said
margaret
i
have
heard
my
father
speak
of
him
yes
perhaps
other
names
will
come
to
you
in
connection
with
your
father
they
did
for
six
years
she
had
put
the
senate
the
house
and
the
whole
body
politic
out
of
view
they
had
all
been
obscured
by
one
small
child
now
they
suddenly
assumed
gigantic
proportions
when
she
reached
the
carriage
her
directions
to
the
coachman
surprised
him
to
the
capitol
she
said
an
overwhelming
desire
was
upon
her
to
enter
the
senate
chamber
again
and
look
that
august
body
over
was
there
anybody
there
now
that
she
would
know
anybody
that
would
know
her
as
she
went
into
the
ladies
gallery
a
tourist
in
the
front
row
with
a
guidebook
in
her
hand
rose
to
go
margaret
slipped
into
the
vacated
seat
and
leaned
over
the
rail
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
there
since
she
used
to
come
with
her
father
then
she
always
sat
in
the
reserved
gallery
there
were
very
few
members
present
a
senator
from
the
west
was
making
a
speech
on
irrigation
to
which
nobody
seemed
to
be
paying
any
attention
not
even
president
whom
he
was
so
earnestly
apostrophizing
as
margaret
looked
at
him
more
closely
she
perceived
that
it
was
a
man
she
had
once
met
at
judge
kirtley
she
distinctly
remembered
the
occasion
and
judge
kirtley
saying
of
him
afterwards
that
he
was
a
man
it
had
seemed
to
her
then
faint
praise
now
seemed
a
cardinal
virtue
in
a
senator
perhaps
she
could
reach
him
through
judge
kirtley
and
there
was
senator
vest
of
missouri
why
was
it
possible
that
he
was
still
here
she
remembered
his
coming
to
her
father
house
when
she
was
a
young
girl
oh
so
many
years
ago
he
was
one
of
her
father
friends
she
had
heard
him
tell
often
of
senator
vest
eulogy
of
the
dog
which
by
its
touching
eloquence
brought
instantly
a
verdict
against
its
slayer
and
there
on
the
other
side
was
senator
hoar
of
massachusetts
who
had
once
written
a
plea
from
the
birds
to
be
presented
to
the
legislature
asking
protection
surely
if
the
hearts
of
these
men
were
open
to
dumb
animals
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
they
would
not
be
shut
to
a
mother
cry
finally
the
senator
who
felt
that
in
storage
reservoirs
for
the
western
waters
lay
the
safety
of
the
country
sat
down
gathered
up
his
papers
and
looked
around
blankly
at
the
empty
seats
chastened
perhaps
but
without
doubt
reflecting
that
his
great
effort
would
reach
the
eyes
of
his
constituents
even
though
the
ears
of
his
colleagues
had
failed
him
and
now
a
new
man
was
on
the
floor
the
comatose
senate
seemed
suddenly
to
have
regained
consciousness
people
leaned
over
the
railings
and
craned
their
necks
to
see
what
was
happening
below
the
senators
were
dropping
in
from
every
quarter
employees
were
lining
up
around
the
room
the
mysterious
button
which
announces
a
speaker
worth
hearing
or
a
question
of
moment
had
evidently
been
pressed
so
far
as
margaret
was
concerned
neither
the
man
nor
the
measure
was
of
the
least
importance
the
subject
might
have
been
the
condition
of
boribooligha
for
all
she
could
tell
about
it
to
her
it
was
an
occasion
to
look
into
the
faces
of
men
who
had
power
to
change
a
law
nothing
more
the
senate
is
not
subject
to
the
fluctuations
of
the
house
as
she
looked
down
upon
them
she
was
surprised
to
see
how
many
she
knew
and
every
familiar
face
gave
her
an
added
sense
of
potentiality
if
only
she
knew
how
to
begin
as
she
passed
through
the
corridor
going
home
she
ran
into
a
florid
little
man
apparently
hurrying
to
reach
the
chamber
before
the
speech
was
ended
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
i
did
observe
why
bless
my
soul
this
little
maggie
varnum
he
had
her
by
the
hand
my
old
daughter
senator
dalgleish
cried
margaret
with
such
genuine
delight
that
the
little
man
beamed
senator
though
he
was
it
is
very
charming
for
rotund
middle
age
to
find
itself
a
source
of
pleasure
to
youthful
grace
and
beauty
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
again
it
has
been
a
long
long
time
has
it
not
time
for
many
things
to
happen
he
sobered
suddenly
your
dear
father
yes
yes
well
it
comes
to
us
all
then
cheerfully
you
keep
your
girlish
looks
let
me
see
you
are
married
yes
margaret
said
slowly
and
widowed
ah
very
sad
very
sad
indeed
the
senator
shook
his
head
several
times
at
a
loss
for
appropriate
words
these
chance
meetings
after
years
develop
such
uncomfortable
topics
is
dalgleish
with
you
margaret
made
no
bid
for
his
sympathy
no
she
will
be
up
after
the
holiday
recess
in
the
meantime
i
am
playing
bachelor
at
the
raleigh
do
like
it
either
there
nothing
like
home
for
an
old
fellow
like
me
come
out
and
dine
with
me
night
suggested
margaret
with
a
sudden
inspiration
i
will
give
you
a
and
an
varnum
welcome
good
i
do
it
seven
you
say
all
right
and
the
place
margaret
handed
him
her
card
as
she
left
him
he
looked
at
it
h
m
de
jarnette
queer
name
seems
as
if
i
had
heard
it
before
de
jarnette
well
by
george
she
a
mighty
handsome
widow
to
the
and
margaret
glanced
at
her
watch
no
home
it
is
too
late
now
for
elmhurst
in
the
carriage
she
leaned
back
thinking
not
so
much
of
philip
and
his
disappointment
as
of
this
chance
meeting
and
the
opportunity
it
threw
in
her
way
it
was
better
to
have
found
this
man
than
to
have
seen
philip
she
was
launched
now
actually
launched
and
that
almost
without
intention
the
fates
certainly
had
favored
her
with
senator
dalgleish
at
her
own
fireside
anxious
to
hear
the
story
of
her
life
and
how
she
had
fared
it
ought
not
to
be
hard
to
enlist
his
sympathies
he
was
always
a
little
man
it
was
a
distinct
advantage
to
be
able
to
tell
that
story
in
her
own
home
when
he
had
been
a
guest
at
her
board
and
if
this
should
prove
advantageous
with
one
her
course
seemed
opening
up
before
her
she
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
bowling
up
massachusetts
avenue
and
deliberately
counted
her
assets
she
had
a
beautiful
home
and
means
to
open
it
whenever
there
was
anything
to
gain
by
doing
so
she
was
opening
it
for
a
distinct
purpose
then
she
had
social
position
or
at
least
she
had
and
that
of
a
kind
that
would
make
its
recovery
an
easy
thing
marie
van
dorn
had
been
right
about
that
well
social
standing
and
wealth
were
good
things
but
they
were
not
all
nor
were
they
the
things
she
chiefly
relied
upon
she
had
discovered
that
day
in
looking
the
senate
over
that
she
was
the
possessor
of
a
number
of
inherited
friendships
with
those
who
sat
in
the
seats
of
the
mighty
her
father
used
to
say
that
elderly
people
liked
to
be
sought
out
by
their
old
friends
children
well
she
would
seek
them
out
those
old
friendships
might
stand
her
now
in
good
stead
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
deliberately
appraised
her
father
friends
as
being
likely
to
be
worth
so
much
and
so
much
to
her
but
it
was
a
good
cause
then
she
had
youth
and
beauty
she
told
herself
this
as
coolly
and
impersonally
as
if
she
had
been
reckoning
up
the
points
of
a
rival
and
neither
was
to
be
ignored
she
had
enough
worldly
wisdom
to
know
that
she
did
not
say
to
herself
as
she
might
have
said
that
in
addition
to
and
far
beyond
these
was
another
possession
that
impalpable
intangible
something
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
we
call
personal
magnetism
that
subtle
power
which
attracts
and
holds
which
persuades
convinces
enlists
kindles
enthusiasm
from
its
own
flame
and
communicates
life
by
the
sheer
force
of
its
vital
touch
as
she
looked
over
her
armory
her
courage
rose
they
were
a
weapons
but
they
were
not
to
be
despised
her
spirit
was
girding
itself
for
the
conflict
there
was
a
positive
sense
of
exhilaration
in
the
thought
of
action
chapter
xxxiii
a
long
pull
and
a
strong
pull
that
session
saw
a
quiet
persistent
effective
campaign
waged
in
the
city
of
washington
many
women
living
there
now
will
remember
it
for
many
were
in
its
forefront
and
what
we
put
ourselves
into
we
do
not
forget
many
men
too
some
still
in
congressional
circles
and
some
by
the
mutations
of
time
and
politics
relegated
to
private
life
may
recall
it
not
a
few
for
the
generous
help
they
gave
but
a
greater
number
as
the
unjust
judge
kept
in
remembrance
the
cause
of
the
widow
whose
continual
coming
wearied
him
the
bill
entitled
an
act
to
amend
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
to
married
women
to
make
parents
the
natural
guardians
of
their
children
and
for
other
purposes
was
introduced
in
the
senate
early
in
january
and
referred
to
the
district
committee
then
the
trials
of
the
gentlemen
comprising
the
committee
not
to
say
the
whole
senate
began
the
beautiful
room
of
the
committee
on
the
district
became
the
mecca
to
which
many
a
pilgrimage
led
naturally
it
was
of
the
first
importance
to
enlist
the
committee
and
it
chanced
that
one
or
two
of
them
were
hard
to
enlist
being
by
nature
and
environment
conservative
and
doubtful
of
anything
that
looked
toward
change
women
had
always
fared
well
in
their
part
of
the
country
and
been
contented
and
they
could
see
no
reason
why
their
status
elsewhere
should
be
tampered
with
this
was
why
belden
had
been
anxious
to
take
margaret
to
see
senator
southard
who
was
one
of
the
committee
and
a
conservative
of
the
conservatives
yes
that
might
justly
be
called
a
campaign
for
it
was
a
connected
series
of
operations
forming
a
distinct
stage
in
a
war
as
the
dictionary
hath
it
and
moreover
all
the
methods
of
war
were
used
there
were
gallant
charges
of
battalions
led
by
experienced
generals
and
the
not
less
effective
guerrilla
warfare
in
which
each
fair
combatant
picked
off
her
man
with
any
weapon
that
was
at
hand
caring
not
for
the
rules
of
combat
but
only
that
he
fell
sieges
were
planned
and
carried
on
during
that
campaign
strategic
positions
were
captured
and
held
there
was
an
occasional
repulse
and
sometimes
danger
of
rout
but
the
forces
always
rallied
and
as
the
winter
passed
it
was
found
that
they
were
steadily
advancing
into
this
determined
but
entirely
womanly
warfare
margaret
threw
herself
with
all
the
ardor
of
her
tempestuous
soul
here
was
something
to
do
she
had
been
too
long
a
creature
simply
to
be
and
to
suffer
before
this
question
of
joint
guardianship
which
to
her
was
the
essence
of
the
bill
all
other
measures
up
before
congress
dwindled
into
insignificance
it
is
a
difficult
thing
for
women
to
sink
the
personal
sometimes
it
seems
difficult
for
men
also
to
margaret
the
passage
of
this
bill
meant
philip
in
her
arms
and
the
overthrow
of
her
enemy
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
to
doubt
that
it
would
give
her
philip
the
opportunity
afforded
by
her
chance
meeting
with
senator
dalgleish
had
been
diligently
followed
up
by
her
own
fireside
he
had
listened
to
the
tragedy
of
her
life
he
would
have
been
less
than
mortal
had
he
heard
it
unmoved
and
when
the
conversation
turned
from
her
wrongs
to
the
bill
which
if
it
became
a
law
would
right
such
wrongs
it
is
not
strange
that
he
was
easily
won
to
its
advocacy
and
ready
to
become
her
by
the
way
he
told
her
at
leaving
with
a
thoughtful
nod
of
the
head
his
colleague
was
a
new
man
in
washington
a
very
fine
man
though
somewhat
provincial
yes
this
was
his
first
term
his
wife
and
daughters
were
somewhat
unused
to
washington
life
and
might
appreciate
some
attention
as
he
would
himself
indeed
perhaps
if
she
would
call
certainly
margaret
said
cheerfully
she
would
be
glad
to
show
any
attention
in
her
power
to
friends
of
his
and
a
new
lead
was
opened
when
she
related
the
events
of
the
evening
to
pennybacker
that
lady
remarked
i
do
really
suppose
margaret
that
your
particular
case
is
any
harder
than
it
would
be
if
you
were
a
mother
of
forty
but
it
will
command
more
sympathy
some
time
in
january
margaret
went
with
belden
to
see
the
senator
from
the
west
who
was
making
the
speech
on
irrigation
the
day
she
was
in
the
senate
he
listened
in
silence
to
belden
presentation
of
the
case
and
then
said
frankly
ladies
you
need
waste
one
minute
on
me
in
the
first
place
i
believe
in
it
but
if
i
did
not
there
is
a
good
reason
why
i
should
support
this
measure
was
elected
by
women
i
should
dare
to
go
back
to
my
constituents
and
tell
them
i
voted
against
this
bill
and
into
margaret
mind
there
flashed
an
instant
recollection
of
pennybacker
words
once
perhaps
they
want
the
ballot
for
something
they
can
do
with
it
as
they
went
away
belden
remarked
to
her
it
is
not
the
western
states
we
have
to
fear
they
are
not
the
ones
that
have
the
narrow
constitutions
thought
has
advanced
since
the
launching
of
the
original
thirteen
it
is
from
the
older
states
that
the
trouble
will
come
we
want
if
possible
to
gain
senator
southard
that
will
be
a
triumph
indeed
for
he
is
really
opposed
to
it
on
principle
i
am
told
what
sort
of
man
is
senator
southard
i
mean
what
line
of
argument
would
be
most
apt
to
appeal
to
him
oh
he
is
a
man
and
opinionated
as
many
of
them
are
thinks
his
road
to
success
is
the
one
that
everybody
ought
to
take
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
yet
i
really
think
he
would
appreciate
a
good
sensible
argument
margaret
was
thinking
perhaps
i
can
get
aunt
mary
after
him
her
kind
she
broached
the
subject
to
pennybacker
that
night
talk
to
a
senator
she
exclaimed
why
margaret
i
never
could
do
it
in
the
world
my
tongue
would
cleave
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
do
you
believe
it
margaret
laughed
bess
i
never
seen
grandma
tongue
in
that
position
yet
nor
the
man
that
could
keep
it
there
you
never
seen
me
in
the
presence
of
a
senator
retorted
her
grandmother
except
a
mild
type
like
senator
dalgleish
but
in
spite
of
her
prompt
declination
she
found
herself
dwelling
much
upon
common
sense
reasons
for
the
passage
of
this
bill
reasons
which
might
appeal
to
an
elderly
man
amenable
to
homely
truth
not
that
she
had
any
idea
of
ever
using
them
no
indeed
she
knew
her
limitations
her
sphere
was
not
lobbying
but
one
day
when
greuze
had
come
by
for
reinforcements
to
visit
senator
black
and
margaret
was
at
elmhurst
pennybacker
put
on
her
best
bonnet
and
joined
the
crusade
taking
bess
who
was
frankly
anxious
to
go
with
her
you
will
do
for
filling
she
remarked
to
her
granddaughter
i
may
possibly
say
something
but
i
do
think
i
shall
an
audience
had
been
arranged
with
the
senator
and
he
received
them
most
courteously
seated
in
the
district
committee
room
the
ladies
of
the
delegation
presented
quite
an
imposing
appearance
greuze
presented
pennybacker
and
her
granddaughter
remarking
effectively
that
the
senator
would
see
that
this
was
a
cause
which
enlisted
the
and
the
alike
and
the
gray
hairs
nodded
assent
while
the
rosy
cheeks
grew
rosier
as
the
great
senator
gaze
rested
upon
them
the
speakers
for
this
occasion
had
been
decided
upon
beforehand
and
the
particular
line
of
argument
that
each
should
take
up
they
were
lucid
forcible
arguments
presented
by
people
who
knew
how
the
senator
gave
most
respectful
heed
to
them
in
all
this
discussion
bess
had
of
course
taken
no
part
her
office
was
purely
decorative
a
function
which
she
fulfilled
it
may
be
said
in
passing
as
fully
and
fragrantly
as
do
the
lilies
of
the
field
the
elderly
senator
whose
sight
was
not
yet
obscured
found
his
attention
wandering
from
the
logical
arguments
of
greuze
to
the
sweet
face
that
blossomed
at
her
side
perhaps
there
might
have
been
a
lurking
thought
in
the
minds
of
these
wise
sisters
that
it
would
be
so
that
the
sweet
innocence
and
beauty
of
her
youthful
femininity
might
prove
a
solvent
for
hearts
callous
to
the
logic
of
more
angular
maturity
just
now
bess
was
taking
an
almost
childish
interest
in
the
with
its
luxurious
appointments
and
its
vaulted
ceiling
with
the
brumidi
frescoes
she
had
always
supposed
a
was
bare
the
senator
found
his
eyes
turning
to
her
frequently
she
was
a
sweet
fresh
blossom
and
when
he
spoke
she
looked
at
him
reverently
being
young
as
though
his
utterances
were
the
oracles
of
god
secure
in
her
belief
that
she
was
only
there
to
swell
the
numbers
and
had
no
part
to
play
she
was
divested
of
all
and
played
it
to
perfection
then
the
senator
noticing
the
rose
pink
in
her
cheek
and
feeling
a
mischievous
desire
to
heighten
it
turned
to
her
suddenly
and
said
my
dear
young
lady
i
do
see
how
you
are
interested
in
this
bill
you
be
pretty
sure
to
get
your
rights
without
it
or
your
privileges
which
will
count
you
for
more
what
are
your
arguments
bess
caught
her
breath
and
drew
back
crimsoning
to
the
roots
of
her
fluffy
hair
that
she
should
be
called
upon
to
speak
had
not
entered
her
pretty
head
she
had
no
arguments
to
her
the
bill
itself
was
a
question
not
of
law
and
right
but
of
margaret
and
her
child
she
had
not
reached
the
age
for
generalizing
the
operations
of
her
mind
were
still
in
terms
of
instead
of
a
b
to
follow
the
genial
autocrat
but
there
was
no
coward
blood
in
bess
veins
though
she
was
pure
feminine
she
valiantly
took
up
the
gage
thrown
down
i
have
any
she
said
with
a
frank
laugh
the
other
ladies
have
the
argument
i
only
came
to
make
one
more
then
modestly
but
still
i
do
know
i
may
be
wrong
of
course
you
know
so
much
better
about
oh
everything
than
i
do
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does
concern
me
more
even
than
it
does
grandma
of
course
i
not
a
mother
but
i
hope
sometime
i
may
be
i
hate
awfully
to
think
i
never
should
the
senator
bowed
respectfully
to
her
womanhood
with
an
indulgent
smile
and
a
significant
wave
of
the
hand
toward
the
elder
ladies
the
gesture
said
you
see
there
is
the
whole
story
in
a
nutshell
this
is
woman
sphere
and
then
continued
bess
with
a
flash
of
her
bright
eyes
i
tell
you
i
would
want
any
old
law
interfering
with
my
child
and
giving
anybody
the
right
to
take
it
away
from
me
i
fight
like
a
well
that
what
they
did
to
margaret
who
is
margaret
asked
the
senator
finding
this
more
interesting
than
prosaic
arguments
oh
i
thought
you
knew
about
margaret
why
it
is
the
case
i
was
referring
to
a
moment
ago
senator
broke
in
greuze
a
little
impatiently
a
case
in
point
exactly
i
will
repeat
one
moment
blandly
interposed
the
gentleman
now
who
is
margaret
my
dear
why
margaret
is
our
friend
grandma
and
mine
the
one
whose
husband
willed
her
baby
away
from
her
i
do
know
why
i
sure
nobody
knows
but
it
was
in
the
will
and
so
it
had
to
stand
the
judge
said
because
that
was
the
law
you
must
have
heard
of
it
no
o
there
are
so
many
things
to
hear
you
know
but
it
interests
me
i
should
like
to
see
your
friend
perhaps
you
will
bring
her
here
to
talk
with
me
some
day
her
story
as
you
tell
it
seems
to
have
some
bearing
on
this
bill
bess
looked
around
at
her
grandmother
this
was
getting
in
rather
deep
for
one
who
had
come
only
as
filling
certainly
said
that
lady
with
affability
and
equal
promptness
you
can
go
over
some
day
i
will
go
with
at
this
attention
was
bestowed
upon
the
older
ladies
and
the
conference
proceeded
in
relating
this
occurrence
to
john
harcourt
that
night
pennybacker
wound
up
by
saying
with
a
suggestive
motion
of
the
head
toward
the
two
bright
faces
opposite
them
i
hardly
think
that
elderly
or
even
arguments
are
the
thing
needed
over
there
do
you
chapter
xxxiv
rescue
work
the
lead
thus
unexpectedly
opened
by
bess
was
promptly
followed
up
by
margaret
who
was
growing
quick
to
see
openings
and
to
take
advantage
of
them
at
her
suggestion
a
note
was
despatched
the
next
day
to
senator
black
asking
for
an
interview
at
the
hour
appointed
the
two
girls
chaperoned
by
pennybacker
were
there
it
would
be
hardly
possible
for
a
story
like
margaret
heard
from
the
quivering
lips
of
the
chief
actor
in
the
tragedy
and
listened
to
under
the
spell
of
her
sad
beautiful
eyes
to
fail
of
reaching
the
heart
of
a
man
like
senator
black
at
its
close
he
reached
over
and
took
her
hand
de
jarnette
he
said
with
genuine
feeling
you
have
suffered
greatly
let
me
assure
you
of
my
sincerest
sympathy
and
what
will
be
more
to
you
i
am
sure
of
my
cordial
support
of
this
bill
the
story
of
your
wrongs
under
the
old
law
has
done
for
your
cause
with
me
what
volumes
of
arguments
about
property
rights
could
not
have
effected
to
my
mind
a
mother
right
to
her
child
is
not
a
question
that
admits
of
discussion
you
can
rely
upon
me
to
do
what
i
can
for
you
i
shall
esteem
it
a
pleasure
to
introduce
you
to
some
of
my
colleagues
and
let
them
hear
your
story
also
she
was
expressing
her
earnest
thanks
for
this
offer
when
he
added
i
only
wish
it
were
possible
for
the
bill
to
do
for
you
personally
as
much
as
you
can
do
for
the
bill
somehow
the
words
chilled
the
glow
at
margaret
heart
what
did
he
mean
why
the
bill
would
do
everything
for
her
if
it
passed
before
she
could
recover
herself
sufficiently
to
ask
an
explanation
the
senator
had
gone
on
gallantly
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
toward
bess
you
certainly
have
an
able
pleader
in
this
young
lady
de
jarnette
i
am
not
sure
that
my
support
should
not
be
credited
at
least
half
to
her
and
bess
went
home
on
air
as
they
were
going
out
of
the
they
came
upon
richard
de
jarnette
face
to
face
he
was
just
going
in
they
passed
each
other
with
the
briefest
acknowledgment
of
acquaintance
what
do
you
suppose
he
is
doing
there
asked
margaret
much
startled
is
that
the
district
he
may
be
there
on
business
with
the
commissioners
he
is
there
to
fight
this
bill
i
know
it
well
there
one
good
thing
said
pennybacker
he
will
interview
senator
black
at
an
auspicious
moment
when
they
were
seated
in
the
carriage
margaret
said
thoughtfully
what
do
you
suppose
senator
black
meant
by
wishing
that
the
passage
of
the
bill
might
help
me
of
course
it
will
help
me
it
will
give
me
philip
if
it
passes
i
wondered
about
that
myself
pennybacker
replied
then
after
a
pause
she
said
casually
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
law
if
it
ever
becomes
one
will
apply
to
cases
that
occurred
before
it
was
enacted
is
there
why
no
said
margaret
with
a
startled
look
i
should
think
so
after
bess
even
had
thus
broken
into
the
senate
as
john
harcourt
expressed
it
in
his
congratulatory
speech
delivered
when
amid
her
blushes
the
story
was
repeated
to
him
pennybacker
felt
almost
cowardly
in
so
persistently
refraining
her
hand
figurative
for
tongue
it
really
had
not
been
so
dreadful
to
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
as
she
had
supposed
perhaps
she
owed
it
to
the
cause
or
to
margaret
at
any
rate
to
give
any
assistance
in
her
power
true
she
had
been
more
or
less
occupied
with
rosalie
since
margaret
had
taken
up
this
new
work
but
of
late
the
girl
had
taken
a
fancy
to
be
alone
more
anyway
she
certainly
would
not
miss
her
if
she
should
take
an
afternoon
off
so
one
day
late
in
the
winter
one
of
margaret
days
at
elmhurst
when
greuze
came
around
in
the
morning
to
drum
up
recruits
for
a
raid
on
senator
southard
in
the
afternoon
pennybacker
was
persuaded
into
going
they
were
to
meet
in
the
rotunda
and
proceed
in
a
body
to
the
senator
on
her
way
to
the
capitol
pennybacker
stopped
at
the
home
of
van
dorn
greuze
had
said
it
is
desirable
to
interest
as
many
women
as
possible
from
different
walks
of
life
in
the
passage
of
this
bill
women
who
will
make
the
committee
see
by
their
presence
and
their
persistency
how
vital
a
thing
it
is
to
them
there
is
some
truth
in
what
senator
southard
says
about
many
women
not
caring
it
is
to
the
indifference
of
the
women
themselves
that
most
of
the
failures
of
the
woman
cause
can
be
traced
we
must
get
a
number
to
go
not
necessarily
to
talk
judgment
must
be
exercised
in
the
selection
of
the
ones
to
do
that
but
to
give
the
moral
support
of
their
presence
pennybacker
determined
when
she
heard
this
that
she
would
try
to
induce
her
niece
to
go
with
them
maria
will
all
right
she
said
reflectively
recalling
whimsically
as
she
said
it
the
young
woman
who
had
once
shown
her
the
history
of
the
world
in
sixty
volumes
brilliantly
bound
in
red
and
gold
she
had
not
had
time
to
acquaint
herself
with
the
names
of
the
authors
but
the
friendly
agent
had
assured
her
that
they
were
the
proper
ones
and
she
said
to
pennybacker
with
considerable
pride
they
will
look
all
right
in
a
library
wo
they
yes
if
there
was
no
talking
to
be
done
maria
would
be
a
very
desirable
acquisition
but
the
matter
being
laid
before
her
it
appeared
that
she
could
not
be
acquired
i
should
be
willing
to
go
i
think
it
would
be
quite
interesting
to
meet
some
of
those
gentlemen
of
course
i
do
know
anything
about
the
bill
but
i
really
ca
do
you
know
i
am
going
to
give
toddlekyns
a
party
this
afternoon
a
birthday
party
he
is
eight
and
i
have
invited
eight
ladies
with
their
dogs
the
birthday
cake
has
just
come
in
is
it
lovely
i
am
going
to
have
eight
pink
candles
on
it
then
thompson
has
sent
me
the
cutest
gift
eight
lamb
chops
on
a
dish
with
a
ruff
of
paper
tied
with
pink
ribbon
around
each
bone
are
they
dear
she
asked
me
what
my
color
scheme
was
but
i
thought
of
course
it
was
flowers
i
did
think
of
such
a
thing
as
a
gift
like
this
so
appropriate
was
it
very
returned
pennybacker
dryly
i
have
often
given
a
plate
of
chops
myself
with
the
meat
removed
to
the
dog
next
door
but
i
have
never
thought
of
putting
on
the
i
will
do
so
when
i
get
home
i
want
to
go
back
with
all
the
washington
kinks
van
dorn
looked
at
her
suspiciously
saying
aunt
mary
i
can
not
understand
your
aversion
to
dogs
i
have
no
aversion
to
dogs
it
doglets
i
hate
i
do
call
that
thing
a
dog
look
at
him
now
toddlekyns
put
upon
his
feet
at
this
moment
looked
for
all
the
world
like
an
animated
decorated
monkey
muff
his
silky
tail
was
tied
with
a
blue
ribbon
and
a
long
forelock
combed
down
over
his
eyes
was
adorned
in
like
manner
his
face
and
legs
were
lost
in
a
mass
of
curling
silky
hair
and
really
it
was
difficult
for
one
confronting
toddlekyns
to
tell
whether
he
was
in
danger
of
a
head
end
or
rear
end
collision
now
a
real
dog
continued
pennybacker
reflectively
is
different
there
is
no
more
beautiful
sight
than
a
child
hanging
about
a
scotch
collie
or
a
big
newfoundland
a
might
hug
a
dog
and
i
would
think
it
was
all
right
i
do
wonder
that
a
shepherd
is
fond
of
an
animal
that
can
round
up
sheep
with
the
intelligence
of
a
man
a
mastiff
in
a
back
yard
one
that
has
to
be
chained
up
to
keep
him
from
chewing
up
any
intruder
has
something
almost
human
about
him
he
knows
that
his
home
is
his
castle
there
is
character
about
such
a
dog
as
that
and
the
bernards
why
maria
i
hope
i
am
not
irreverent
when
i
think
of
those
noble
creatures
plowing
through
snow
and
storm
to
rescue
some
poor
perishing
mortal
it
seems
to
me
almost
a
type
of
the
divine
love
that
came
to
seek
and
to
save
the
lost
it
does
indeed
but
it
a
far
cry
from
the
monks
and
dogs
of
bernard
to
the
idle
women
and
the
poodles
of
the
cities
the
very
best
people
said
van
dorn
firmly
make
much
of
dogs
it
is
the
thing
to
do
why
aunt
mary
the
bench
shows
of
new
york
are
simply
immense
i
know
it
i
read
about
them
there
certainly
is
something
strange
about
how
people
that
have
this
dog
craze
let
it
run
away
with
them
joel
bennett
used
to
tell
a
story
on
a
kansas
city
minister
who
was
very
fond
of
dogs
she
was
living
with
her
son
george
who
had
a
lot
of
them
and
was
a
good
hand
to
train
them
she
was
very
sick
at
one
time
and
this
minister
who
was
her
pastor
used
to
come
out
often
to
see
her
giving
spiritual
comfort
to
her
and
dog
talk
to
george
i
suppose
well
one
day
he
had
but
a
short
time
to
stay
having
to
catch
a
train
and
he
asked
her
if
there
was
any
special
subject
she
would
like
to
have
him
converse
upon
bennett
was
a
very
christian
so
she
said
yes
she
would
like
to
have
him
talk
to
her
about
the
plan
of
salvation
bennett
he
said
is
nothing
i
feel
so
sure
of
and
nothing
that
it
delights
me
more
to
talk
about
than
the
plan
of
salvation
just
then
george
came
in
with
one
of
the
dogs
naturally
they
fell
to
talking
about
it
bennett
used
to
say
with
a
twinkle
of
her
eye
was
the
last
i
heard
of
the
plan
of
salvation
she
smiled
to
herself
reminiscently
as
she
always
did
in
recalling
her
friend
how
is
margaret
asked
van
dorn
after
a
pause
the
dog
story
did
not
seem
to
require
comment
it
was
rather
pointless
but
she
politely
ignored
that
i
suppose
she
is
still
lonely
without
philip
or
does
she
get
over
it
i
ca
say
that
she
has
got
entirely
over
it
aunt
mary
i
do
know
that
you
will
agree
with
me
van
dorn
said
with
some
firmness
but
think
if
margaret
would
get
her
mind
on
something
besides
herself
society
or
something
of
that
kind
she
would
be
a
great
deal
better
off
or
philanthropy
would
be
a
good
thing
for
her
van
dorn
had
never
yet
been
told
about
rosalie
and
her
child
some
of
those
things
are
in
excellent
form
i
was
just
reading
as
you
came
in
about
one
that
seems
to
me
so
beautiful
so
so
inspiring
what
is
it
pennybacker
was
glad
to
know
of
any
phase
of
philanthropy
that
interested
her
niece
it
is
a
form
of
rescue
work
the
article
is
headed
refuge
for
homeless
dogs
i
read
it
to
you
a
recent
meeting
of
the
bullion
society
for
homeless
dogs
held
at
the
residence
of
sarah
holden
it
was
unanimously
agreed
to
change
the
original
name
of
the
organization
to
animal
rescue
league
of
washington
in
view
of
the
widened
scope
of
the
work
arrangements
were
completed
for
the
purchase
of
a
home
in
the
neighborhood
of
hyattsville
where
a
permanent
refuge
will
be
established
for
the
care
of
dogs
it
is
the
intention
of
the
league
to
remove
the
home
to
their
new
quarters
at
hyattsville
early
in
the
autumn
where
they
will
keep
open
house
throughout
the
year
is
that
a
beneficent
charity
she
exclaimed
a
rapt
expression
on
her
unlined
face
beneficent
fiddlesticks
returned
pennybacker
if
i
were
called
upon
to
characterize
that
proceeding
with
exactness
maria
i
should
call
it
sentimental
gush
gone
to
seed
what
are
they
going
to
save
these
dogs
from
a
dependent
old
age
or
a
life
of
shame
like
most
persons
of
her
calibre
van
dorn
was
deficient
in
a
sense
of
humor
she
missed
the
satirical
note
and
answered
literally
they
are
going
to
provide
a
home
for
the
homeless
and
befriend
the
friendless
that
sounds
well
it
is
christlike
exclaimed
van
dorn
with
more
enthusiasm
than
she
usually
exhibited
why
the
officers
elected
i
did
read
you
their
names
are
away
up
in
society
it
is
certainly
christlike
to
befriend
the
friendless
returned
pennybacker
ignoring
the
social
status
of
the
officers
elected
but
it
strikes
me
there
needs
to
be
a
modicum
of
sense
displayed
in
the
choice
of
subjects
as
i
remember
it
christ
always
gave
the
preference
to
those
that
do
not
perish
like
the
beasts
he
came
looking
after
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
israel
it
is
true
but
they
were
sheep
with
souls
i
do
seem
to
remember
that
he
spent
much
time
hunting
up
stray
dogs
indeed
the
only
case
i
recall
in
which
he
paid
attention
to
animals
at
all
was
in
the
gadarene
country
and
that
was
rather
disastrous
to
the
animals
you
remember
he
sacrificed
a
whole
herd
of
swine
two
thousand
in
number
mark
says
to
save
the
reason
of
one
poor
suffering
lunatic
i
think
that
was
about
the
right
proportion
to
my
mind
it
shows
the
relative
importance
he
attaches
to
the
two
how
christian
women
can
walk
around
here
in
the
southwest
quarter
of
washington
and
then
give
their
energies
to
rescuing
is
more
than
i
can
understand
when
she
had
got
a
block
or
so
away
from
the
house
she
opened
her
rather
tightly
set
lips
to
remark
to
herself
it
is
just
as
well
she
might
have
been
tempted
to
say
something
some
of
these
brilliantly
bound
volumes
do
have
such
fool
things
in
them
chapter
xxxv
pennybacker
talks
in
senator
southard
pennybacker
found
herself
surrounded
with
earnest
women
pleading
for
the
weak
and
helpless
of
their
own
sex
and
life
seemed
suddenly
to
have
widened
out
into
a
great
and
noble
thing
she
drew
long
breaths
as
one
does
in
stepping
from
the
confined
atmosphere
of
a
close
room
into
the
pure
free
air
of
heaven
it
was
glorious
to
be
alive
and
to
have
a
part
in
a
work
like
this
she
thanked
god
that
she
would
be
permitted
to
add
her
mite
to
the
efforts
making
up
the
sum
total
of
this
movement
for
the
betterment
of
estate
she
saw
her
duty
now
and
was
ready
to
do
it
if
opportunity
offered
she
would
no
longer
shrink
back
from
saying
her
word
opportunity
did
not
offer
until
late
in
the
interview
after
property
rights
and
business
rights
had
all
been
disposed
of
she
had
said
to
greuze
when
that
lady
had
urged
her
to
take
some
part
in
the
discussion
i
could
help
you
a
particle
until
it
comes
to
the
item
of
joint
guardianship
i
do
know
anything
about
those
other
questions
but
i
have
some
views
on
maternal
rights
and
maybe
i
could
make
them
understood
that
is
exactly
what
we
want
you
to
talk
about
said
greuze
these
other
women
who
have
studied
up
the
subject
can
attend
to
the
first
part
of
the
bill
but
when
it
comes
to
a
mother
rights
i
know
you
could
say
something
to
the
point
and
that
it
would
be
put
in
a
telling
way
it
is
an
insidious
kind
of
flattery
even
pennybacker
was
not
proof
against
it
as
they
made
their
way
through
the
corridors
leading
from
the
rotunda
to
the
she
was
figuratively
girding
up
her
loins
when
the
delegation
filed
into
his
senator
southard
felt
glad
that
it
was
here
he
was
to
receive
them
he
was
the
kind
of
man
that
relies
upon
office
furniture
and
green
covered
table
for
moral
support
in
an
encounter
with
the
opposite
sex
these
things
impress
women
some
women
and
the
of
a
depress
men
some
men
the
consciousness
that
they
had
invaded
his
territory
put
him
at
his
ease
he
listened
attentively
to
the
various
arguments
advanced
putting
in
a
word
here
and
there
bowing
assent
frequently
and
nodding
thoughtfully
as
a
new
train
of
thought
was
suggested
all
seemed
to
be
going
so
well
that
pennybacker
began
to
feel
that
her
word
would
be
superfluous
but
greuze
who
had
had
wider
experience
in
these
things
observed
that
the
senator
had
never
once
committed
himself
she
even
thought
she
could
discover
a
little
vein
of
combativeness
in
his
attitude
a
allaine
had
just
finished
a
forcible
plea
for
the
right
of
women
to
carry
on
business
in
their
own
names
ladies
said
the
senator
i
hope
you
will
pardon
me
when
i
say
that
i
seriously
question
the
expediency
of
a
woman
ever
entering
upon
a
business
career
we
are
not
here
senator
allaine
replied
quickly
to
argue
a
question
of
expediency
but
of
right
you
will
not
deny
that
it
should
be
lawful
for
a
woman
to
earn
her
bread
in
any
honest
way
even
if
it
be
not
expedient
the
senator
fell
back
upon
platitudes
man
is
the
natural
he
asserted
with
a
trace
just
a
trace
of
patronage
it
is
the
privilege
of
the
strong
to
provide
for
the
weak
in
these
days
of
late
marriages
retorted
allaine
with
a
laugh
men
seem
rather
reluctant
to
claim
their
privileges
and
in
the
meantime
a
woman
must
provide
for
herself
and
those
dependent
upon
her
or
go
to
the
wall
suppose
such
a
woman
should
ask
you
to
show
cause
why
she
should
not
do
it
in
her
own
way
what
would
you
tell
her
or
supposing
even
that
it
is
not
a
question
of
support
she
has
a
life
on
her
hands
which
must
be
filled
with
something
what
would
you
advise
her
to
turn
to
the
senator
was
not
ready
with
his
answer
to
this
question
and
a
small
lady
with
very
bright
black
eyes
occupied
his
time
george
william
curtis
says
tell
her
that
god
has
given
her
the
nursery
the
and
the
opera
and
that
if
these
fail
he
has
graciously
provided
the
kitchen
the
washtub
and
the
needle
the
senator
emerged
from
the
laugh
that
followed
not
to
answer
the
question
put
to
him
but
to
say
i
am
not
yet
convinced
ladies
that
it
is
the
wish
of
the
majority
of
the
women
of
this
district
that
this
bill
should
become
a
law
our
delegation
represents
five
thousand
women
protested
allaine
i
will
admit
that
this
is
a
large
and
representative
delegation
said
the
senator
with
a
complimentary
wave
of
his
hand
but
even
five
thousand
is
a
small
part
of
the
women
of
the
district
where
are
the
ninety
and
nine
that
do
not
come
forward
many
of
them
senator
are
too
ignorant
to
realize
their
own
wrongs
or
to
know
that
there
is
any
redress
for
them
it
is
because
of
that
very
ignorance
and
helplessness
that
we
are
here
to
plead
for
them
and
yet
it
is
true
as
senator
southard
says
said
greuze
and
we
may
as
well
admit
it
that
too
many
women
are
apathetic
about
these
things
i
was
once
myself
i
say
it
with
shame
and
confusion
of
face
for
i
see
things
very
differently
now
but
i
had
always
had
all
the
rights
i
wanted
and
did
not
know
how
many
people
there
were
in
the
world
who
were
not
so
fortunate
as
i
one
third
of
the
women
do
know
that
these
things
exist
because
they
have
never
been
touched
by
them
and
another
third
do
care
it
is
left
for
a
very
small
remnant
not
a
third
though
they
will
be
a
third
some
day
who
both
know
and
care
to
straighten
things
out
that
is
true
corroborated
pennybacker
who
had
as
yet
taken
no
part
in
the
discussion
i
went
by
for
a
lady
to
come
over
here
with
us
and
she
declined
promptly
said
she
had
more
important
work
at
home
she
illustrates
one
class
of
women
who
and
a
very
important
class
let
me
say
interposed
the
senator
promptly
associating
all
the
womanly
virtues
with
her
who
stayed
at
home
especially
with
her
who
stayed
away
from
the
a
class
which
it
is
to
be
hoped
for
the
good
of
the
nation
will
never
grow
smaller
or
less
powerful
i
trust
you
will
pardon
my
plainness
ladies
i
am
a
plain
man
and
must
talk
to
you
as
one
man
talks
to
another
or
as
a
man
may
always
safely
talk
to
earnest
women
said
greuze
the
senator
bowed
it
is
to
this
class
i
was
going
to
say
rather
than
to
those
who
go
outside
the
sacred
precincts
of
the
home
striving
to
stir
up
antagonism
between
the
sexes
seeking
even
as
your
honorable
body
is
doing
to
to
to
secure
a
mother
right
to
her
children
prompted
pennybacker
the
senator
frowned
seeking
to
influence
legislation
i
was
going
to
remark
it
is
to
such
noble
women
content
to
immolate
themselves
upon
the
altar
of
sacrifice
for
their
little
ones
to
find
their
broadest
field
of
endeavor
within
the
sanctuary
of
home
pennybacker
was
regarding
the
senator
with
marked
attention
had
he
known
her
better
he
might
not
have
considered
this
cause
for
unmixed
felicitation
as
it
was
he
felt
the
subtle
flattery
of
her
deferential
hanging
upon
his
every
word
and
stimulated
by
it
soared
higher
ah
ladies
i
can
not
refrain
from
expressing
the
belief
that
it
is
to
such
noble
women
that
we
must
look
for
the
regeneration
of
the
race
they
are
doing
a
great
work
as
somebody
remarked
i
can
not
at
this
moment
recall
exactly
who
it
was
that
said
it
but
if
you
were
going
to
say
that
they
were
doing
a
great
work
and
could
not
come
down
remarked
the
small
woman
with
the
bright
eyes
who
had
a
satirical
look
of
having
heard
this
before
it
was
nehemiah
and
he
said
it
to
sanballat
yes
yes
said
the
senator
who
was
a
trifle
weak
in
the
hebrew
prophets
that
it
exactly
are
doing
a
great
work
so
that
they
can
not
come
down
that
is
what
these
noble
women
who
stay
at
home
are
doing
observed
pennybacker
reflectively
this
one
was
having
a
dog
party
and
eight
other
noble
women
who
could
come
down
were
going
to
take
their
dogs
to
it
this
punctured
the
senator
oratorical
balloon
so
sharply
that
it
came
to
earth
with
a
thump
leaving
him
not
even
a
parachute
to
hang
to
and
while
it
was
in
collapse
pennybacker
whose
tongue
no
longer
clave
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
took
the
opportunity
to
remark
it
is
dangerous
to
generalize
senator
southard
unless
you
have
a
good
deal
of
data
i
have
observed
that
not
all
of
the
women
who
stay
away
from
public
gatherings
and
committee
meetings
do
so
because
of
their
devotion
to
their
children
some
of
them
have
any
children
and
have
they
ca
take
time
from
their
pleasures
to
be
bothered
with
babies
or
they
are
not
willing
to
give
up
the
apartment
house
where
they
can
have
every
comfort
every
luxury
except
children
some
of
them
substitute
dogs
and
give
dog
parties
but
the
women
we
are
talking
about
senator
southard
she
went
on
earnestly
are
not
of
that
kind
they
are
the
women
who
children
and
want
to
establish
their
legal
right
to
them
the
mother
part
of
this
bill
is
the
one
i
am
talking
for
it
may
be
that
a
married
woman
no
right
to
her
own
property
though
i
will
confess
that
it
beats
me
to
see
why
it
may
be
that
she
should
have
the
right
to
buy
sell
or
convey
property
so
far
as
that
is
concerned
a
good
many
married
ought
not
to
have
that
right
having
such
poor
business
judgment
that
their
wives
should
have
been
appointed
their
guardians
from
the
start
and
i
am
not
at
all
sure
but
i
should
agree
with
you
that
it
is
not
expedient
for
women
to
carry
on
business
i
think
a
good
deal
may
be
said
on
both
sides
of
that
question
you
need
look
at
me
that
way
allaine
i
expedient
of
course
it
should
be
lawful
no
there
is
room
for
an
honest
difference
of
opinion
on
all
these
points
but
when
it
comes
to
the
question
of
a
mother
having
an
equal
right
with
the
father
to
the
child
she
has
borne
i
can
not
see
how
there
can
be
two
opinions
there
to
my
mind
the
question
of
joint
guardianship
is
the
pith
of
this
bill
it
touches
women
at
their
tenderest
point
and
it
touches
them
every
one
greuze
nodded
slightly
to
a
lady
across
the
room
this
was
going
all
right
she
motioned
with
one
eye
to
the
senator
who
was
listening
with
respectful
attention
it
had
been
a
little
more
respectful
perhaps
since
pennybacker
had
agreed
with
him
as
to
the
inexpediency
of
a
woman
going
into
business
we
are
all
human
even
senators
pennybacker
had
lost
herself
in
her
subject
these
things
had
been
seething
in
her
soul
since
the
night
margaret
came
to
her
a
fugitive
now
that
her
tongue
was
loosed
she
was
glad
more
than
glad
to
give
them
utterance
think
of
a
mother
having
to
stand
and
plead
for
a
legal
right
to
the
child
she
has
borne
she
went
on
moving
her
chair
a
little
nearer
to
the
senator
when
you
come
right
down
to
it
who
has
a
right
that
approaches
hers
leaving
out
of
account
all
sentiment
all
thought
of
the
price
she
has
paid
for
ownership
in
her
offspring
and
looking
at
it
in
a
purely
practical
way
who
has
a
right
that
can
be
better
substantiated
who
is
it
that
risks
her
life
every
time
there
is
a
child
born
into
the
world
who
is
it
that
the
almighty
has
fitted
to
take
care
of
those
children
who
is
it
that
keeps
the
family
together
when
a
man
dies
and
leaves
a
lot
of
helpless
little
ones
what
does
a
woman
do
give
those
children
away
to
this
one
and
that
anybody
that
can
be
induced
by
love
or
money
to
take
them
ah
no
she
gets
out
her
sewing
machine
or
her
washtub
and
goes
to
work
she
does
know
any
other
way
she
does
want
any
other
way
it
may
be
but
a
poor
little
shack
that
she
has
to
keep
them
in
it
has
any
of
the
luxuries
of
the
apartment
house
but
it
has
the
children
and
it
is
a
home
and
makes
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
she
does
ask
any
help
about
it
either
it
is
often
pretty
short
commons
with
them
she
gives
them
meat
when
she
can
get
it
and
and
encouragement
when
she
ca
but
ten
chances
to
one
she
will
make
men
and
women
of
them
the
most
worthless
men
in
a
community
are
not
widow
sons
as
a
rule
did
you
ever
think
of
that
senator
southard
the
senator
nodded
reflectively
he
had
often
thought
of
it
this
was
a
hobby
he
was
a
widow
son
himself
as
it
happened
and
had
been
reared
in
just
such
a
school
though
he
was
leagues
and
leagues
away
from
it
now
there
rose
before
him
the
little
bowed
mother
in
black
who
had
struggled
for
him
at
her
machine
his
eyes
softened
as
he
thought
of
it
sometimes
continued
pennybacker
she
is
a
grade
beyond
the
and
the
scrubbing
brush
what
does
she
do
then
brushes
the
cobwebs
off
the
little
acquirements
the
public
school
or
the
seminary
gave
her
years
ago
and
finds
a
place
to
teach
or
scrapes
together
enough
money
to
buy
a
and
goes
to
work
she
may
have
to
be
away
from
them
through
the
day
but
you
never
hear
of
her
making
that
an
excuse
for
foisting
her
children
on
somebody
else
she
makes
some
shift
gets
somebody
to
stay
with
them
while
she
is
gone
or
does
something
and
keeps
them
by
the
way
senator
southard
speaking
of
scanty
equipment
do
you
know
of
anything
crueler
than
thrusting
a
woman
out
into
the
world
to
fight
for
herself
and
her
fatherless
children
with
no
weapons
but
a
point
and
a
it
is
getting
better
all
the
time
i
will
admit
but
education
in
my
day
was
like
teaching
a
boy
to
swim
and
a
girl
to
wade
and
then
taking
them
out
into
deep
water
and
shoving
them
both
overboard
of
course
the
boy
can
strike
out
it
was
intended
that
he
should
deep
water
helps
him
but
the
girl
beg
pardon
the
girl
you
think
generally
shoves
herself
out
in
these
days
not
always
often
the
swimmer
who
is
bearing
her
and
her
little
ones
up
goes
down
death
does
care
anything
about
sex
and
i
have
never
noticed
that
he
enquires
even
whether
a
man
can
be
spared
or
how
many
are
dependant
upon
him
he
just
sends
a
big
wave
over
him
and
down
he
goes
then
of
course
the
woman
who
has
been
carried
along
before
this
has
to
strike
out
with
one
hand
while
she
holds
the
children
up
with
the
other
often
she
ca
do
more
than
water
until
the
oldest
boy
is
able
to
swim
and
again
the
senator
mind
went
back
to
the
brave
little
mother
in
black
treading
water
that
was
about
what
it
was
she
could
hardly
keep
their
heads
above
the
waves
he
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
with
eyes
that
did
not
see
the
frescoing
they
were
filled
with
a
vision
of
the
little
unpainted
house
the
hollyhocks
the
kitchen
fire
around
which
they
had
all
crowded
she
would
not
let
one
of
them
go
the
scanty
table
the
patched
knees
and
she
had
never
lived
to
see
him
here
i
wonder
they
any
of
them
reach
the
shore
pennybacker
was
saying
when
he
came
back
to
the
i
do
believe
many
of
them
would
if
it
were
not
for
the
touch
of
little
hands
they
would
give
up
and
go
under
but
the
very
thing
that
you
would
think
would
drag
them
down
is
what
buoys
them
up
with
a
child
hand
clinging
to
her
hand
and
a
child
looking
into
hers
the
way
they
look
up
into
a
eyes
a
woman
to
struggle
she
ca
help
it
any
more
than
she
can
help
breathing
it
is
the
parent
instinct
i
suppose
said
the
senator
thoughtfully
i
do
know
it
does
seem
to
be
the
male
parent
instinct
his
first
motion
generally
is
to
disencumber
himself
a
can
give
his
children
away
and
not
half
try
pennybacker
had
been
borne
along
by
her
interest
in
the
subject
and
its
entirely
familiar
aspect
forgetting
her
companions
and
everything
else
but
the
senator
she
wanted
to
convince
the
other
ladies
telegraphed
approbation
to
one
another
as
she
proceeded
but
when
she
thus
began
to
turn
the
other
side
of
the
shield
for
some
reason
glances
of
disapproval
and
slight
frowns
began
to
pass
among
them
one
of
them
leaning
forward
to
lay
something
on
the
table
adopted
the
feminine
expedient
of
touching
pennybacker
foot
significantly
that
lady
turned
and
looked
at
her
with
the
obtuseness
of
a
man
at
his
own
and
then
proceeded
what
does
a
man
do
when
his
wife
dies
and
leaves
him
with
a
family
of
children
keep
them
together
as
she
does
no
indeed
he
knows
he
and
i
am
not
saying
that
he
can
for
little
children
and
the
care
of
them
belong
rightfully
and
naturally
to
women
and
that
is
why
we
are
trying
to
have
this
law
changed
so
as
to
give
her
a
legal
as
well
as
a
natural
right
to
them
what
does
he
do
why
he
gives
them
away
to
anybody
that
will
take
them
it
does
hurt
him
in
the
least
apparently
to
see
them
scattered
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
or
and
this
is
what
he
does
oftener
than
anything
else
there
was
now
marked
consternation
in
the
faces
of
the
ladies
behind
her
for
they
knew
as
well
as
she
did
what
men
do
oftener
than
anything
else
oftener
than
any
other
way
he
looks
around
for
some
girl
usually
the
youngest
he
can
find
that
will
have
him
somebody
of
course
that
does
know
one
thing
about
children
he
is
thinking
about
that
and
marries
her
just
as
soon
as
decency
allows
and
sometimes
sooner
well
she
has
done
it
now
whispered
greuze
to
the
lady
who
was
acquainted
with
sanballat
and
nehemiah
pennybacker
noticed
a
peculiar
look
on
the
senator
face
whether
of
amusement
embarrassment
or
offence
she
could
not
tell
and
was
made
dimly
conscious
by
a
glance
at
her
companions
that
something
was
wrong
but
she
had
thought
of
a
story
that
she
wanted
to
tell
and
was
not
to
be
suppressed
why
senator
southard
i
actually
heard
a
judge
in
the
supreme
court
of
this
district
defend
that
atrocious
law
of
charles
ii
by
which
a
man
has
the
right
to
will
his
children
away
from
the
mother
on
the
ground
that
women
were
likely
to
marry
again
likely
to
marry
again
will
you
think
of
that
i
wanted
to
rise
up
in
court
and
say
to
him
what
i
said
to
a
man
who
was
trying
to
prove
to
me
one
day
that
more
men
died
than
women
look
at
the
great
number
of
widows
on
south
street
he
said
compare
them
with
the
small
number
of
widowers
and
earth
i
said
is
owing
to
any
undue
mortality
among
the
men
it
is
because
they
wo
remain
widowers
the
senator
laughed
a
little
constrainedly
saying
that
he
guessed
they
could
deny
the
soft
impeachment
but
that
their
defense
was
in
the
attractiveness
of
the
other
sex
greuze
put
in
a
graceful
word
which
had
the
effect
to
switch
the
conversation
gently
to
another
track
without
perceptible
jar
and
the
conference
was
soon
at
an
end
out
in
the
corridor
with
the
door
of
the
safely
closed
they
gathered
excitedly
around
pennybacker
well
what
is
it
what
have
i
done
she
demanded
oh
groaned
greuze
you
killed
us
we
never
recover
from
this
do
you
know
that
is
exactly
what
he
did
married
a
girl
younger
than
his
daughter
and
in
less
than
a
year
pennybacker
jaw
dropped
i
ought
not
to
have
come
she
said
i
told
you
i
would
be
sure
to
say
something
you
ought
not
to
have
me
come
then
her
sense
of
humor
came
to
her
relief
well
there
one
comfort
it
was
the
truth
and
he
got
it
straight
chapter
xxxvi
margaret
resolve
while
pennybacker
was
thus
effectively
wielding
the
that
common
sense
and
observation
had
laid
ready
at
her
hand
margaret
bleeding
on
the
field
was
ready
to
give
up
the
fight
an
ambushed
foe
had
fallen
upon
her
and
borne
her
down
and
before
she
could
recover
herself
courage
who
had
been
through
it
all
her
strong
support
and
chiefest
counselor
had
turned
craven
and
fled
while
this
fitly
though
inadequately
describes
the
girl
condition
of
mind
as
she
sat
in
the
car
swiftly
traversing
the
short
distance
between
elmhurst
and
washington
there
was
nothing
in
her
outward
appearance
to
indicate
that
it
was
so
the
occupants
in
that
saw
in
margaret
a
young
woman
remarkable
for
nothing
perhaps
but
the
pronounced
beauty
of
her
face
and
her
rather
queenly
carriage
it
was
a
mild
surprise
to
see
a
woman
of
this
type
get
on
at
a
way
station
as
she
sat
intently
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
moving
panorama
of
winter
trees
seen
now
to
best
advantage
stripped
of
their
summer
garments
one
might
have
thought
her
a
devotee
of
nature
with
an
eye
and
heart
single
to
that
alone
but
the
oaks
and
the
elms
and
the
lesser
folk
of
the
were
in
reality
making
an
impression
on
a
retina
as
unseeing
as
though
back
of
it
there
were
no
brain
this
quiet
looking
lady
looking
out
at
the
wintry
landscape
with
such
apparent
appreciation
was
saying
to
herself
in
the
abandon
of
despair
is
it
true
can
it
be
true
a
phantom
shape
had
been
pursuing
margaret
de
jarnette
for
months
a
specter
of
evil
form
and
visage
it
had
given
her
just
a
glimpse
of
itself
now
and
then
it
was
quick
to
hide
behind
more
agreeable
forms
and
she
was
always
glad
to
lose
it
then
she
would
forget
it
until
some
day
it
would
start
up
before
her
like
a
grinning
death
head
for
a
brief
second
and
again
disappear
she
had
eluded
it
she
had
denied
its
existence
even
to
herself
but
she
knew
now
that
she
had
feared
it
from
the
first
and
refused
to
face
it
it
had
taken
bodily
shape
and
grappled
with
her
it
was
through
mammy
cely
that
the
incarnation
came
margaret
had
been
talking
to
the
old
woman
as
she
often
did
about
the
case
in
court
its
long
delay
and
finally
the
bill
and
the
relief
which
that
promised
even
if
the
case
in
court
failed
miss
margaret
said
mammy
cely
not
looking
at
her
but
speaking
in
a
voice
of
great
compassionateness
is
you
sho
that
bill
gwineter
you
why
certainly
margaret
answered
as
she
had
answered
pennybacker
when
she
had
asked
the
same
foolish
question
it
was
at
such
times
that
the
specter
rose
before
her
it
will
give
me
philip
mammy
cely
still
looked
away
marse
richard
that
bill
do
have
nothin
all
to
do
with
philip
maybe
he
do
know
she
added
but
rather
doubtfully
for
she
had
boundless
confidence
in
richard
knowledge
he
certainly
does
not
know
said
margaret
sharply
how
did
you
happen
to
be
talking
to
him
about
it
i
jes
accidently
mentioned
that
you
was
layin
off
to
take
philip
as
soon
as
the
bill
passed
and
he
the
bill
did
have
no
bearin
on
the
case
he
say
it
ca
ondo
a
thing
that
was
done
years
ago
margaret
felt
that
she
had
received
a
blow
a
sudden
recollection
of
senator
black
words
flashed
upon
her
and
she
grew
so
white
that
mammy
cely
prudently
refrained
from
any
more
discussion
of
the
subject
she
might
have
told
her
how
in
the
goodness
of
her
heart
she
had
gone
to
de
jarnette
hoping
to
stir
pity
in
his
breast
and
said
marse
richard
do
you
reckon
that
po
chile
gwineter
live
ef
this
here
bill
givin
her
philip
do
pass
and
how
he
had
answered
her
in
shocked
amazement
giving
her
philip
great
heavens
you
do
tell
me
she
is
expecting
that
he
really
looked
so
concerned
that
it
seemed
to
mammy
cely
as
if
the
emotion
she
had
been
trying
to
fan
into
flame
flared
up
for
a
moment
but
it
and
her
hope
went
out
together
as
he
added
coldly
if
that
is
what
she
is
working
for
she
might
as
well
give
it
up
that
bill
could
undo
what
was
done
years
ago
she
did
not
tell
margaret
all
this
however
contenting
herself
with
repeating
no
he
say
it
do
have
no
bearin
on
the
case
it
is
false
cried
margaret
with
vehement
iteration
he
find
that
it
will
have
some
bearing
on
the
case
before
we
are
through
her
anger
sustained
her
until
she
reached
the
station
then
when
she
had
kissed
philip
and
settled
back
weakly
in
her
seat
a
horrible
sinking
of
soul
came
over
her
what
if
it
were
true
looking
out
at
the
shivering
trees
and
the
leaden
sky
impassively
she
was
telling
herself
in
a
transport
of
feeling
and
of
fear
that
it
was
not
true
it
be
true
but
thinking
of
senator
black
strange
look
of
pity
and
his
stranger
words
i
wish
this
bill
could
do
as
much
for
you
de
jarnette
as
you
can
do
for
it
doubt
began
to
clutch
at
her
heart
was
this
what
he
meant
going
over
her
interviews
with
this
one
and
that
in
these
weeks
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
recall
traces
of
compassion
in
their
words
their
looks
as
they
talked
with
her
she
had
thought
then
it
was
pity
for
her
wrongs
was
it
for
her
blindness
why
had
nobody
told
her
had
she
no
friend
that
it
must
be
left
for
her
enemy
to
enlighten
her
why
had
they
let
her
go
on
working
for
this
thing
as
though
her
soul
salvation
had
depended
upon
it
only
to
find
out
when
all
was
done
that
it
was
but
an
abstract
law
something
that
would
be
useful
to
humanity
perhaps
but
left
her
desolate
as
before
humanity
what
was
humanity
to
a
mother
robbed
shame
smote
her
then
she
heard
the
voice
of
greuze
saying
of
a
fellow
worker
she
has
a
heart
big
enough
to
take
in
the
world
and
all
its
woes
but
then
belden
was
childless
perhaps
god
had
given
her
empty
hands
that
she
might
work
for
weak
ones
too
weighted
down
with
cares
to
help
themselves
well
he
had
emptied
her
arms
too
was
it
thus
that
the
great
heart
of
humanity
was
brought
to
throb
in
unison
she
felt
suddenly
strengthless
as
if
some
spring
of
life
were
broken
how
she
had
labored
for
this
thing
sparing
not
herself
in
any
way
giving
time
and
strength
and
travail
of
soul
to
the
furtherance
of
this
bill
and
to
what
purpose
only
an
hour
ago
she
was
planning
what
she
would
say
to
senator
blanton
when
she
went
to
see
him
she
had
been
so
successful
that
she
was
eager
to
try
her
powers
of
persuasion
again
it
was
a
joy
to
work
in
a
great
cause
like
this
now
the
zest
had
faded
out
of
life
as
the
color
out
of
an
evening
cloud
everything
was
stale
flat
and
unprofitable
what
profit
hath
a
man
of
all
his
labor
which
he
taketh
under
the
sun
came
suddenly
to
her
mind
with
a
force
never
felt
before
who
was
it
said
that
oh
yes
the
wise
man
of
course
she
had
often
heard
pennybacker
quote
the
words
well
he
wise
she
told
herself
scornfully
there
no
profit
and
the
wise
man
had
found
it
out
she
wondered
weakly
feeling
very
tired
all
at
once
if
he
had
discovered
it
before
he
had
worn
himself
out
the
train
moved
steadily
on
the
scene
constantly
shifted
but
she
did
not
see
de
jarnette
had
said
that
the
bill
would
not
give
her
philip
she
must
think
it
out
before
she
got
there
what
to
do
now
at
the
station
her
carriage
was
waiting
for
her
to
judge
kirtley
office
on
the
way
looking
absently
from
the
carriage
window
she
saw
a
lady
with
a
little
boy
about
philip
age
holding
to
her
hand
and
skipping
by
her
side
it
was
strange
but
all
the
children
seemed
to
be
about
philip
age
the
boy
was
telling
something
eagerly
and
she
could
catch
his
childish
treble
and
see
the
mother
smile
a
pang
shot
through
her
to
see
the
sweet
comradeship
between
the
two
did
the
woman
know
how
blest
she
was
on
the
street
in
full
view
of
the
capitol
they
passed
the
entrance
to
one
of
the
blind
alleys
that
still
disgrace
washington
a
drunken
man
piloted
by
a
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
another
clinging
to
her
skirts
was
making
toward
the
alley
the
man
insecure
of
footing
lurched
forward
almost
under
the
horses
feet
the
coachman
reined
them
in
suddenly
and
the
woman
jerked
the
man
back
with
an
oath
he
turned
and
struck
her
kicking
the
child
when
it
cried
with
fright
margaret
drew
a
quick
breath
here
here
under
the
very
shadow
of
the
dome
a
drunken
brutish
man
who
could
neither
protect
his
children
nor
take
care
of
himself
was
given
rights
to
those
children
that
the
mother
could
not
share
could
not
share
and
could
not
shake
off
unless
unless
the
bill
should
pass
she
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
and
closed
her
eyes
in
the
office
she
lost
no
time
in
circumlocution
judge
kirtley
she
asked
cutting
short
his
protestations
of
surprise
at
seeing
her
is
it
true
that
if
this
joint
guardianship
bill
passes
it
will
not
give
me
philip
give
you
philip
why
child
my
child
you
have
supposed
god
bless
my
soul
he
broke
off
abruptly
the
idea
that
her
ignorance
of
the
law
should
have
misled
her
into
supposing
that
the
bill
would
help
her
personally
except
so
far
as
it
might
influence
the
decision
of
the
court
when
her
case
came
up
had
never
occurred
to
him
she
had
thrown
herself
headlong
into
this
movement
without
asking
advice
from
anybody
but
he
had
supposed
that
it
was
from
her
rather
natural
sympathy
for
womankind
and
he
had
welcomed
it
as
a
diversion
to
her
in
the
trying
time
of
awaiting
action
by
the
court
in
fact
he
had
encouraged
her
efforts
he
was
wondering
now
blankly
if
that
encouragement
had
not
been
it
would
not
help
me
in
any
way
she
persisted
reading
the
answer
in
his
disturbed
face
he
answered
her
plainly
then
though
with
a
caution
the
fact
that
such
a
bill
had
been
passed
after
much
agitation
might
have
its
effect
upon
the
decision
of
the
court
when
your
case
comes
up
i
should
not
say
that
that
would
be
impossible
nor
even
improbable
but
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
it
could
affect
it
a
law
like
that
would
not
be
retroactive
it
is
better
for
you
to
know
this
now
margaret
she
sat
so
long
without
speaking
that
he
began
nervously
to
dread
a
or
an
outburst
such
as
she
used
to
give
way
to
he
had
no
need
to
fear
the
woman
before
him
was
not
the
girl
of
those
tempestuous
days
no
school
develops
us
so
swiftly
as
sorrow
school
with
the
little
nunnery
maid
who
talked
with
guinevere
she
had
learned
to
cry
her
cry
in
silence
and
have
done
but
it
would
help
other
women
in
years
to
come
she
said
at
last
in
a
voice
that
thrilled
with
feeling
women
who
can
not
fight
for
themselves
the
woman
of
the
street
was
before
her
who
do
not
have
a
friend
like
you
to
fight
for
them
unquestionably
if
that
bill
becomes
a
law
no
other
woman
in
this
district
will
ever
stand
where
you
do
pleading
for
her
child
she
stood
up
then
with
eyes
shining
and
head
thrown
back
then
let
me
do
what
i
can
she
cried
this
is
not
for
one
woman
but
for
many
oddly
enough
as
he
looked
at
her
there
came
into
his
mind
two
pictures
he
had
seen
on
her
own
walls
one
the
old
familiar
one
of
the
sitting
mother
clasping
to
her
heart
the
divine
child
as
if
she
would
keep
him
forever
within
her
sheltering
arms
the
other
with
face
illumined
and
a
larger
vision
that
took
in
the
whole
world
needs
holding
the
up
an
offering
to
humanity
the
woman
before
him
might
have
been
a
chair
madonna
yesterday
she
was
a
sistine
chapter
xxxvii
the
red
paper
spring
was
come
once
more
had
been
wrought
the
old
old
miracle
which
is
ever
new
and
every
hill
and
nestling
valley
around
washington
was
singing
the
resurrection
song
even
the
green
grass
at
margaret
feet
and
the
hyacinths
and
daffodils
as
she
moved
among
them
seemed
to
say
lo
the
winter
is
past
the
flowers
appear
on
the
earth
the
time
of
the
singing
of
birds
is
come
and
the
voice
of
the
turtle
is
heard
in
the
land
there
was
a
note
of
jubilance
in
it
all
perhaps
she
was
feeling
still
the
influence
of
the
easter
allelujahs
of
yesterday
perhaps
it
was
that
the
mellowness
of
the
warm
spring
air
had
somehow
got
into
her
very
soul
this
morning
and
swept
away
the
clouds
of
doubt
or
possibly
it
was
only
that
margaret
was
young
and
hope
springs
eternal
whatever
the
cause
the
girl
looked
out
upon
the
world
of
budding
nature
around
her
with
an
ecstacy
which
had
its
overtone
of
sadness
as
all
such
ecstacies
have
for
natures
like
hers
it
was
a
beautiful
world
a
beautiful
world
and
it
would
not
be
long
now
she
knelt
upon
the
grass
by
her
flower
beds
and
buried
her
face
in
the
sweet
fragrance
of
the
hyacinths
her
heart
was
strangely
open
this
easter
monday
to
the
influences
around
her
yes
spring
had
come
the
long
lonely
winter
was
gone
it
had
been
long
long
and
lonely
but
judge
kirtley
had
said
the
case
must
come
up
soon
and
when
it
did
she
surely
would
get
him
it
seemed
almost
certain
now
that
the
bill
would
pass
and
it
help
her
in
some
way
even
judge
kirtley
had
said
it
might
have
its
influence
with
the
court
then
her
thoughts
passed
to
pleasanter
things
for
philip
was
to
spend
a
whole
day
with
her
and
she
was
to
take
the
children
to
the
easter
monday
mammy
cely
had
laid
it
before
de
jarnette
that
any
child
living
within
going
distance
and
then
not
allowed
to
embrace
the
opportunity
was
jes
bodaciously
robbed
and
indeed
it
was
almost
true
for
it
is
a
festival
for
the
children
of
washington
in
which
white
black
and
brown
participate
mammy
cely
had
been
coloring
eggs
for
days
that
stood
out
afterwards
in
margaret
de
jarnette
mind
as
a
day
of
perfect
happiness
save
for
the
knowledge
that
it
must
soon
end
the
delight
of
the
children
at
the
animated
scene
on
the
white
lot
was
unbounded
that
of
pennybacker
and
bess
not
far
behind
it
even
harcourt
found
them
before
the
morning
was
over
and
found
them
in
a
characteristic
way
the
word
was
passed
quietly
around
that
the
president
would
appear
at
a
certain
time
on
the
south
portico
and
the
crowd
gathered
there
the
de
jarnette
party
happened
to
be
standing
near
a
policeman
when
a
distracted
mother
rushed
up
to
him
oh
have
you
seen
my
little
girl
i
lost
her
she
is
only
four
oh
what
shall
i
do
do
get
excited
the
policeman
said
with
a
soothing
gesture
she
has
been
taken
over
to
the
east
gate
oh
have
you
found
her
no
but
i
have
found
you
somebody
else
will
find
her
and
take
her
there
so
we
will
get
you
together
hardly
had
she
gone
on
her
way
rejoicing
before
another
appeared
in
like
distress
officer
i
lost
my
little
boy
oh
what
shall
i
do
he
had
on
a
blue
suit
and
he
is
so
timid
do
get
excited
the
man
said
you
will
find
him
over
at
the
east
entrance
etc
you
seem
to
have
plenty
to
do
said
pennybacker
oh
yes
they
lose
their
children
this
way
all
day
long
you
let
go
a
child
hand
in
a
crowd
like
this
and
he
is
lost
in
a
minute
bess
and
margaret
each
tightened
her
clutch
of
a
little
hand
the
crowd
was
very
dense
here
for
even
democratic
america
loves
to
see
its
chief
executive
pennybacker
had
pushed
a
little
ahead
of
the
policeman
and
was
looking
at
the
rounding
colonnade
when
she
heard
an
anxious
falsetto
voice
behind
her
oh
you
seen
an
old
lady
about
with
dress
and
spectacles
on
she
got
away
from
me
what
i
do
do
get
excited
you
find
her
over
at
the
east
entrance
said
the
policeman
in
his
mechanical
formula
he
was
struggling
with
the
crowd
and
had
not
quite
caught
the
description
pennybacker
turned
around
to
find
john
harcourt
doubled
up
with
laughter
you
rascal
you
die
of
some
sort
of
degeneracy
of
the
heart
long
before
i
for
hours
the
tide
set
in
through
the
east
entrance
and
swirled
and
ebbed
and
flowed
when
at
last
the
gates
closed
upon
the
throng
the
de
jarnette
party
sought
the
ellipse
where
the
children
had
been
promised
a
lunch
harcourt
and
bess
had
fallen
behind
the
others
as
they
reached
the
seats
beneath
the
trees
he
said
wheedlingly
to
pennybacker
i
do
think
your
little
girl
has
had
a
very
good
time
she
had
any
eggs
or
balloon
or
anything
suppose
you
let
me
give
her
a
row
up
the
river
just
to
keep
her
from
feeling
neglected
then
looking
at
the
basket
we
take
the
portion
that
falls
to
us
and
eat
it
on
the
way
when
the
two
were
gone
and
the
children
had
had
their
lunch
and
gone
off
to
play
the
two
ladies
sat
and
watched
them
how
nicely
they
play
together
remarked
margaret
yes
said
pennybacker
absently
margaret
i
am
quite
disturbed
about
rosalie
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
her
lately
what
is
the
trouble
has
she
had
any
more
of
those
fainting
spells
never
since
the
first
one
the
nurse
thought
she
was
likely
to
have
them
at
any
time
but
she
has
never
had
another
queer
what
caused
that
weakness
i
suppose
and
yet
she
grows
weaker
every
day
yes
margaret
somehow
she
has
never
seemed
the
same
to
me
since
that
day
you
know
how
happy
she
was
when
she
first
came
we
were
speaking
that
very
morning
i
remember
about
the
look
of
peace
that
had
come
into
her
face
yes
she
had
lost
that
distressed
expression
do
you
suppose
she
can
feel
hurt
at
my
being
with
her
so
little
these
days
no
it
is
that
sometimes
i
think
she
is
more
troubled
after
you
have
been
there
than
at
any
other
time
the
nurse
even
has
noticed
it
sometimes
i
think
she
has
something
on
her
mind
still
something
she
wants
to
tell
why
she
has
told
me
everything
it
ca
be
that
i
told
her
about
the
bill
one
day
feeling
that
it
would
do
her
good
to
have
something
new
to
think
about
she
seemed
to
feel
quite
a
little
interested
in
it
asks
me
from
time
to
time
how
it
is
getting
along
and
always
if
it
will
give
you
philip
she
seemed
greatly
troubled
over
what
judge
kirtley
said
a
mother
sympathy
i
suppose
poor
girl
i
guess
it
must
have
been
that
but
it
queer
it
was
that
very
day
that
i
heard
her
moaning
to
herself
she
did
know
i
was
in
the
room
and
i
went
to
her
and
said
what
is
it
that
troubles
you
she
looked
up
at
me
in
such
a
distressed
way
and
said
i
have
been
a
wicked
woman
if
i
could
only
confess
confess
that
was
what
she
said
i
said
child
confess
to
god
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
margaret
i
never
shall
forget
the
answer
she
gave
me
she
said
in
a
sort
of
despair
have
i
have
but
he
hides
his
face
poor
child
said
margaret
i
will
go
in
and
see
her
somehow
margaret
had
never
found
the
parting
from
philip
so
hard
as
it
was
i
have
such
an
unaccountable
dread
of
something
happening
to
him
she
said
i
have
never
felt
it
before
i
ai
gwineter
let
nothin
happen
to
him
miss
margaret
he
jes
as
safe
with
me
as
he
is
with
you
ai
i
tuk
good
keer
of
him
all
winter
the
child
did
look
the
picture
of
health
and
wholesomeness
his
cheeks
were
glowing
now
from
his
chase
of
louis
and
his
eyes
were
bright
but
at
the
mention
of
his
going
they
overflowed
mama
i
do
want
to
go
why
ca
i
stay
wiv
you
and
louis
oh
darling
it
broke
her
heart
to
send
him
away

shrinking
from

keeping

peremptory
gesture

the
station
i
certainly

take
care
of
this
child
for
fifteen
minutes
come
philip
while
they
were
waiting
in
the
house
on
north
capitol
de
jarnette
took
out
the
deed
he
had
to
deliver
and
was
looking
it
over
the
girl
who
opened
the
door
had
said
holton
would
be
in
in
a
moment
but
the
moment
lengthened
and
philip
catching
sight
of
a
child
peering
in
bashfully
from
the
hall
and
feeling
the
attraction
of
youth
for
youth
edged
out
toward
him
then
the
man
of
the
house
came
into
the
parlor
from
a
room
back
of
it
and
the
sound
of
voices
came
to
philip
he
was
very
sure
that
he
was
not
bothering
his
uncle
richard
now
and
he
was
by
nature
a
friendly
child
what
the
matter
wiv
your
hands
he
asked
the
other
child
a
little
younger
stood
bashfully
picking
at
his
palm
peelin
he
said
laconically
then
brightening
up
say
i
got
a
dog
when
richard
de
jarnette
and
the
man
stepped
into
the
hall
a
few
moments
later
philip
was
alone
the
boy
had
gone
to
get
the
dog
the
man
looked
startled
to
see
a
child
there
and
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
richard
took
philip
hand
said
hastily
and
what
the
man
called
after
them
was
not
heeded
as
they
went
out
of
the
yard
the
child
with
the
close
observation
of
his
age
asked
unker
wichard
what
do
they
have
a
wed
paper
for
de
jarnette
was
hurrying
with
such
rapid
strides
to
the
station
that
his
nephew
could
hardly
keep
up
with
him
he
was
intent
on
making
the
train
and
did
not
hear
and
in
his
hurrying
philip
forgot
all
about
the
red
paper
chapter
xxxviii
the
mother
comes
to
her
own
it
was
ten
days
or
more
after
this
that
de
jarnette
carriage
stood
at
the
door
ready
to
convey
her
to
the
capitol
it
was
confidently
expected
that
the
bill
would
come
up
now
within
a
few
days
and
there
were
a
good
many
working
bees
around
that
classic
edifice
belden
had
asked
de
jarnette
to
go
with
her
that
afternoon
since
her
talk
with
judge
kirtley
margaret
had
been
unremitting
in
her
labors
belden
told
pennybacker
that
she
had
never
done
more
efficient
work
there
was
something
very
touching
she
said
in
her
plea
so
simply
but
so
effectively
urged
it
will
not
help
me
but
it
will
help
other
women
it
almost
seems
said
pennybacker
in
repeating
this
to
judge
kirtley
only
the
day
before
as
if
this
thing
were
slowly
purging
her
of
self
she
is
being
tried
in
the
fire
but
she
will
come
out
of
it
with
the
dross
burned
away
i
never
have
seen
a
woman
grow
in
character
as
margaret
de
jarnette
has
in
this
trying
half
year
i
trust
she
may
get
her
reward
said
the
judge
but
there
is
no
telling
i
tremble
for
her
if
there
should
be
an
adverse
decision
there
is
one
thing
pennybacker
spoke
the
lord
is
preparing
margaret
for
whatever
he
is
preparing
her
her
ear
has
been
opened
to
sorrow
cry
and
her
hands
will
never
be
utterly
empty
again
moves
in
a
mysterious
way
his
wonders
to
perform
that
is
as
true
now
as
it
was
when
cowper
under
the
shadow
of
a
great
cloud
said
it
margaret
was
buttoning
her
gloves
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
she
had
just
come
down
from
rosalie
room
since
her
talk
with
pennybacker
on
the
ellipse
she
had
been
particularly
careful
not
to
neglect
the
poor
girl
and
had
tried
in
every
way
to
brighten
her
up
she
is
so
weak
and
her
situation
so
peculiar
that
she
might
easily
see
slights
that
were
never
intended
she
was
saying
to
herself
she
took
the
card
that
the
servant
handed
her
and
glanced
at
the
clock
with
a
shade
of
annoyance
she
would
just
have
time
to
meet
her
engagement
at
the
capitol
without
interruption
as
she
looked
at
the
card
her
face
blanched
it
read
richard
de
jarnette
in
the
parlor
she
hardly
waited
for
a
conventional
greeting
what
is
it
has
anything
happened
to
philip
yes
he
answered
gravely
philip
is
ill
not
alarmingly
so
i
hope
but
seriously
what
is
the
matter
with
him
how
long
has
he
been
sick
i
knew
nothing
of
it
till
yesterday
morning
though
mammy
cely
tells
me
he
was
restless
and
feverish
all
the
night
before
i
sent
for
the
doctor
at
once
and
he
got
a
nurse
there
by
noon
i
shall
get
another
one
a
night
nurse
two
nurses
what
do
they
think
it
is
the
doctor
pronounces
it
scarlet
fever
scarlet
fever
every
vestige
of
color
left
her
face
how
could
he
have
taken
scarlet
fever
has
he
been
exposed
to
it
then
rapidly
counting
back
it
must
have
been
at
the
since
she
had
answered
her
own
question
de
jarnette
apparently
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
do
so
she
looked
at
her
watch
and
moved
across
the
room
i
assure
you
that
he
shall
have
every
possible
care
but
i
felt
that
you
ought
to
know
if
you
should
wish
to
go
to
him
she
turned
as
she
reached
the
bell
and
looked
at
him
without
reply
tell
fanny
to
pack
a
few
things
suitable
for
the
sick
room
in
my
suit
case
she
said
to
the
servant
who
answered
and
be
quick
about
it
she
called
him
back
to
add
send
pennybacker
to
me
can
we
catch
the
three
train
she
asked
in
a
voice
so
contained
that
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
i
fear
not
and
the
next
does
not
go
till
five
if
i
notice
that
your
carriage
is
at
the
door
if
you
would
not
mind
the
ride
that
would
be
the
quickest
way
to
get
there
we
could
make
it
in
an
hour
by
good
driving
then
we
will
go
that
way
just
at
this
minute
pennybacker
came
in
she
sat
down
looking
her
surprise
at
seeing
de
jarnette
there
was
that
in
his
face
which
precluded
the
thought
of
his
being
here
for
any
trivial
reason
i
am
going
with
de
jarnette
to
elmhurst
said
margaret
with
preternatural
calmness
philip
is
ill
with
scarlet
fever
scarlet
fever
pennybacker
searching
eyes
were
upon
de
jarnette
how
in
the
world
could
he
have
been
exposed
to
scarlet
fever
probably
the
day
of
the
margaret
again
answered
for
him
i
leave
everything
with
you
i
shall
be
there
indefinitely
but
margaret
child
you
ought
not
to
go
alone
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
go
with
you
and
yet
i
do
see
how
i
can
leave
rosalie
she
is
in
that
condition
that
it
is
impossible
to
tell
when
the
end
will
come
she
may
linger
for
weeks
and
it
may
come
at
any
moment
you
ca
go
said
margaret
and
bess
can
not
go
for
she
is
too
much
of
a
child
herself
and
besides
she
has
never
had
scarlet
fever
no
there
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
go
alone
the
nurse
will
be
there
suggested
de
jarnette
oh
the
said
pennybacker
aunt
mary
if
she
grew
white
and
shut
her
lips
if
the
worst
comes
margaret
let
me
know
and
i
will
go
to
you
no
matter
what
happens
here
said
pennybacker
hastily
but
keep
up
a
good
courage
my
child
and
trust
in
god
arm
is
not
shortened
that
it
can
not
save
nor
his
ear
heavy
that
it
can
not
hear
de
jarnette
stepped
into
the
hall
he
knew
instinctively
that
margaret
would
not
want
him
here
now
when
they
were
in
the
carriage
and
pennybacker
standing
beside
it
he
turned
to
margaret
i
forgot
to
say
that
i
called
semple
for
philip
if
there
is
any
one
else
you
would
rather
have
i
should
be
glad
to
make
the
change
margaret
looked
disturbed
i
should
not
want
semple
he
is
too
young
and
besides
she
might
have
said
i
do
not
like
him
or
feel
easy
in
his
presence
for
all
this
was
true
but
she
finished
the
sentence
and
besides
i
would
rather
have
anderson
our
own
physician
de
jarnette
tucked
the
robe
around
margaret
and
turned
to
pennybacker
will
you
telephone
anderson
to
come
out
by
the
five
train
the
carriage
will
be
at
the
station
to
meet
him
ask
him
to
come
prepared
to
spend
the
night
if
necessary
no
not
in
consultation
to
take
charge
of
the
case
i
will
make
it
right
with
semple
they
were
soon
out
of
the
city
and
on
the
country
road
leading
to
elmhurst
drive
fast
rogers
margaret
had
said
as
they
started
they
made
no
pretence
of
keeping
up
conversation
they
were
together
only
for
the
understood
purpose
of
getting
to
the
child
as
quickly
as
possible
after
the
first
few
questions
and
answers
they
had
lapsed
into
a
silence
which
neither
felt
inclined
to
break
both
were
busy
with
their
thoughts
once
margaret
groping
blindly
for
possible
causes
said
you
do
know
of
any
way
in
which
he
could
have
been
exposed
i
i
think
it
must
have
been
the
day
after
of
the
he
said
probably
after
he
left
you
and
mammy
cely
promised
so
faithfully
to
look
after
him
she
said
reproachfully
i
really
think
said
de
jarnette
hesitatingly
he
would
have
given
a
good
slice
of
his
inheritance
to
have
been
able
to
lay
the
blame
upon
mammy
cely
but
remembering
her
insistent
faithfulness
and
goaded
by
his
conscience
he
could
not
do
other
than
to
tell
her
the
truth
that
if
philip
was
exposed
that
day
i
am
the
one
to
blame
margaret
was
looking
at
him
with
a
fixed
attention
which
compelled
explanation
i
i
took
him
with
me
against
her
remonstrances
i
feel
obliged
in
common
justice
to
say
to
a
house
where
i
had
business
he
begged
to
go
and
i
could
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
but
as
it
turned
out
it
was
most
unfortunate
i
have
reason
to
think
that
there
was
a
child
in
the
house
recovering
from
scarlet
fever
and
in
just
the
condition
semple
tells
me
to
communicate
it
and
there
was
no
card
she
asked
in
wonder
he
hesitated
they
tell
me
there
was
a
card
but
i
will
have
to
acknowledge
that
i
did
not
see
it
you
took
philip
in
spite
of
mammy
cely
remonstrances
into
a
house
infected
with
a
deadly
disease
she
said
slowly
and
failed
to
see
the
most
obvious
of
warnings
say
all
you
want
to
say
he
answered
miserably
you
can
not
blame
me
more
than
i
have
blamed
myself
six
months
before
she
would
have
taken
him
at
his
word
but
a
sudden
sense
of
the
futility
of
words
smote
her
perhaps
too
even
in
that
trying
moment
the
wretchedness
of
his
face
touched
her
recriminations
are
worse
than
useless
she
said
at
last
i
have
found
that
out
there
have
been
enough
of
them
between
us
in
god
name
let
us
work
together
for
once
and
try
to
save
him
you
are
more
than
generous
he
said
after
a
long
pause
how
much
more
quickly
does
thought
travel
than
foot
of
beast
was
leaping
forward
with
lightning
rapidity
she
was
at
philip
side
saw
him
gasping
dying
in
her
arms
stood
beside
his
casket
looking
down
upon
the
face
that
she
would
see
no
more
saw
a
solitary
woman
figure
sitting
by
a
little
grave
saying
this
is
the
end
then
it
seemed
as
if
she
heard
an
unknown
voice
saying
this
was
a
quarrel
that
god
alone
could
settle
and
he
has
done
it
in
his
own
way
she
drew
a
quick
breath
then
almost
like
a
child
gasping
sob
oh
anything
but
that
anything
let
him
but
live
the
wheels
moved
turned
on
monotonously
she
watching
them
nothing
could
be
so
bitter
and
so
hopeless
as
death
a
bible
story
that
she
had
heard
pennybacker
read
one
day
in
rosalie
room
came
suddenly
without
reason
into
her
mind
it
was
about
the
two
women
who
claimed
the
one
child
each
saying
this
is
my
son
that
liveth
and
thy
son
is
the
dead
it
had
seemed
to
her
a
cruel
test
that
solomon
the
wise
had
put
them
to
when
he
said
bring
me
a
sword
and
then
divide
the
living
child
in
two
and
give
half
to
the
one
and
half
to
the
other
and
while
the
false
claimant
said
yea
let
it
be
neither
mine
nor
thine
but
divide
it
surely
it
was
the
true
mother
the
one
whose
the
living
child
was
that
cried
out
with
yearning
oh
my
lord
give
her
the
living
child
and
in
no
wise
slay
oh
it
was
a
true
test
anything
but
death
but
death
a
shiver
passed
through
her
and
richard
de
jarnette
leaning
over
tucked
the
robe
around
her
without
speaking
only
once
did
he
open
his
lips
after
that
then
as
if
urged
by
the
impetus
of
some
kindred
fear
he
leaned
forward
and
spoke
to
the
coachman
drive
faster
mammy
cely
met
them
at
the
door
and
took
margaret
to
her
room
while
de
jarnette
went
directly
to
philip
he
was
possessed
of
a
wild
fear
that
the
child
might
be
dead
when
they
got
there
he
wondered
a
little
at
margaret
delay
why
did
she
not
go
directly
to
him
he
understood
it
five
minutes
later
when
she
came
quietly
in
clothed
in
her
garb
this
was
no
visit
she
had
come
to
stay
he
marveled
to
see
her
quiet
contained
manner
as
she
came
in
he
moved
instinctively
toward
the
door
feeling
himself
an
intruder
in
his
own
house
there
seemed
almost
profanation
in
his
witnessing
the
meeting
between
the
two
he
had
separated
but
he
did
not
go
soon
enough
to
miss
philip
glad
cry
mama
oh
nor
margaret
soothing
answer
which
was
cheery
as
well
yes
dearest
mama
come
to
stay
now
there
there
mama
knows
he
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
when
anderson
and
the
night
nurse
got
there
margaret
was
in
control
i
can
hardly
see
any
necessity
for
her
staying
she
said
when
after
the
doctor
examination
she
had
followed
him
down
to
the
library
where
richard
was
for
consultation
with
one
thoroughly
competent
nurse
to
direct
things
and
see
that
everything
is
right
i
would
rather
not
have
the
other
one
around
i
shall
be
with
him
all
the
time
any
way
with
the
second
nurse
here
that
will
not
be
necessary
urged
de
jarnette
it
is
desirable
to
have
you
here
but
between
them
they
can
do
all
the
nursing
and
save
you
that
is
why
i
got
this
second
one
you
have
done
all
that
money
can
do
margaret
said
coldly
but
there
are
some
things
money
can
not
do
one
of
them
is
to
fill
a
mother
place
at
a
sick
child
bed
i
shall
stay
in
philip
room
at
night
whether
they
wish
it
or
not
i
shall
not
leave
him
to
the
nurses
and
they
may
as
well
understand
it
i
only
meant
to
relieve
her
if
possible
explained
de
jarnette
to
the
doctor
when
she
was
gone
you
ca
very
well
relieve
a
mother
when
her
child
is
sick
de
jarnette
the
doctor
said
rather
dryly
it
is
in
giving
not
in
saving
herself
that
she
finds
comfort
let
her
have
her
own
way
so
in
a
great
at
philip
side
where
he
could
see
her
if
he
woke
she
lay
and
watched
the
hours
away
it
was
richard
big
leather
covered
chair
that
he
had
brought
up
for
her
when
he
found
she
would
not
be
persuaded
she
could
notice
the
odor
of
cigar
smoke
about
it
the
taper
burning
dimly
threw
into
relief
against
the
shadows
the
little
white
bed
where
lay
the
child
and
beyond
it
the
bookcase
where
his
unused
books
and
playthings
were
even
at
that
moment
she
noted
jealously
how
they
were
accumulating
the
ghostly
light
showed
her
the
morning
glories
on
the
lattice
and
the
humming
birds
that
philip
loved
and
the
sad
eyes
of
the
bodenhausen
the
nurse
wisely
provident
against
a
time
of
waking
was
dozing
in
her
chair
how
strange
it
was
to
be
here
in
this
house
the
house
of
her
enemy
the
man
whose
grip
had
been
on
her
heart
for
five
long
years
she
had
reason
to
hate
him
how
hard
and
unrelenting
he
had
been
how
bitterly
hard
and
yet
going
over
the
events
of
this
day
one
by
one
she
could
not
say
that
at
close
range
he
had
seemed
other
than
a
man
of
flesh
and
blood
chapter
xxxix
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
the
days
that
followed
there
was
fierce
battle
made
for
the
life
and
the
rival
claimants
fought
side
by
side
for
once
all
animosities
were
laid
aside
all
bitterness
forgotten
they
were
making
common
cause
now
against
man
implacable
foe
and
nothing
draws
us
together
like
a
community
of
interests
or
fears
physicians
nurses
servants
all
gave
their
best
aid
there
is
something
about
a
fight
with
death
that
instantly
fills
the
ranks
but
it
was
upon
these
two
that
the
stress
fell
and
they
shared
it
by
one
of
those
unaccountable
fancies
of
a
sick
person
philip
had
taken
a
dislike
to
the
nurse
and
would
let
her
do
nothing
for
him
the
other
one
had
been
sent
back
the
morning
after
she
came
do
you
think
we
had
better
change
asked
de
jarnette
of
the
doctor
still
the
nurse
seems
faithful
and
competent
it
is
a
most
unfortunate
notion
he
has
taken
children
have
very
poor
judgment
said
anderson
satirically
he
knew
how
matters
stood
with
the
de
jarnettes
and
was
not
on
the
side
of
the
testamentary
guardian
it
is
not
unusual
for
them
to
prefer
the
most
inexperienced
mother
to
a
competent
nurse
no
let
it
alone
it
will
work
itself
out
it
worked
itself
out
by
their
taking
almost
entire
charge
of
him
themselves
the
nurse
was
always
there
it
is
true
to
direct
to
warn
to
prepare
draughts
and
appliances
but
it
was
they
who
must
administer
for
philip
would
have
it
so
i
want
unker
wichard
to
hold
me
he
said
one
day
mama
will
hold
you
darling
margaret
answered
with
quick
jealousy
i
want
unker
wichard
to
hold
me
and
she
looked
on
while
richard
settled
himself
in
the
big
chair
and
took
the
child
in
his
arms
she
turned
away
as
she
saw
philip
look
of
content
it
is
because
de
jarnette
is
stronger
the
nurse
said
in
a
low
tone
seeing
margaret
look
children
love
a
man
strength
it
rests
them
i
want
mama
to
hold
my
hand
said
philip
from
the
depths
of
his
uncle
arms
and
margaret
taking
a
stool
sat
close
beside
the
big
chair
and
held
the
little
feverish
hand
he
dropped
asleep
at
last
and
fearing
to
wake
him
they
sat
thus
for
a
long
time
a
long
long
time
it
seemed
to
margaret
but
she
could
not
get
her
hand
away
without
his
clutching
it
and
murmuring
i
want
unker
wichard
sometimes
when
the
child
was
restless
richard
would
take
him
in
his
arms
and
walk
with
him
up
and
down
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
great
chamber
he
never
seemed
to
grow
weary
margaret
noticed
and
he
was
as
gentle
in
his
touch
as
a
woman
perhaps
there
was
something
as
the
nurse
had
said
in
the
combination
of
strength
and
gentleness
to
quiet
overwrought
nerves
she
began
to
have
a
comprehension
of
a
child
need
of
something
to
rest
upon
she
had
never
supposed
that
richard
de
jarnette
could
be
gentle
and
then
without
any
special
reason
her
thoughts
drifted
back
to
that
trying
time
when
she
first
found
out
that
she
was
a
deserted
wife
no
she
could
not
say
that
he
had
not
been
gentle
then
but
since
what
a
strange
man
he
was
so
full
of
inconsistencies
one
day
when
she
had
been
holding
philip
and
started
to
get
up
with
him
in
her
arms
he
this
hard
cold
man
who
had
not
spoken
two
words
to
her
that
day
stopped
her
with
a
word
and
before
she
could
resist
had
taken
the
child
from
her
saying
almost
sternly
do
ever
do
that
no
woman
is
strong
enough
to
get
up
with
a
child
of
his
size
in
her
arms
it
struck
her
as
a
very
strange
thing
that
he
should
thus
look
out
for
her
should
even
think
of
such
a
trifling
thing
but
she
gave
philip
up
to
him
without
comment
during
those
days
and
nights
of
anxiety
they
lived
in
and
for
the
boy
meals
came
and
went
and
they
ate
them
together
sometimes
in
silence
oftener
talking
of
him
days
dawned
to
be
filled
with
work
for
him
then
darkness
fell
and
covered
the
earth
with
its
pall
and
their
hearts
with
its
terrors
in
the
morning
they
said
would
god
it
were
night
and
in
the
night
would
god
it
were
morning
of
the
outer
world
they
heard
only
through
the
doctor
who
brought
them
daily
tidings
and
messages
of
encouragement
from
pennybacker
rosalie
was
slowly
failing
it
did
not
seem
possible
for
her
to
leave
her
now
unless
the
sentence
was
never
finished
de
jarnette
had
not
been
to
town
since
the
day
he
brought
margaret
out
he
had
voluntarily
chosen
to
go
into
quarantine
with
her
in
the
she
had
protested
at
first
but
without
avail
and
later
she
had
come
to
depend
upon
him
and
was
glad
to
have
him
there
it
seemed
to
divide
the
responsibility
he
do
seem
to
take
no
in
nothin
but
that
chile
mammy
cely
said
one
day
he
is
wropped
up
in
him
and
no
wonder
philip
the
onlies
one
of
his
fambly
left
and
for
once
margaret
forgot
to
be
angry
that
philip
was
thus
aligned
with
the
de
jarnettes
instead
of
the
varnums
everything
but
philip
was
thrust
into
the
background
now
i
have
good
news
for
you
de
jarnette
said
the
doctor
one
morning
as
he
put
his
thermometer
into
the
child
mouth
and
waited
philip
was
at
his
worst
that
day
and
he
wanted
to
get
her
thoughts
away
from
him
for
a
few
moments
at
least
and
leave
her
with
something
to
think
about
your
bill
has
passed
the
senate
has
it
she
answered
indifferently
then
with
an
impatience
that
could
hardly
wait
how
is
it
doctor
is
it
any
lower
i
wager
she
has
forgotten
already
what
i
said
to
her
the
doctor
communed
with
himself
women
are
all
alike
they
can
manage
the
affairs
of
the
nation
or
the
universe
until
their
children
get
sick
and
then
it
all
up
well
i
guess
that
the
way
the
lord
meant
to
be
one
afternoon
the
doctor
called
the
nurse
into
the
adjoining
room
and
talked
with
her
in
low
tones
when
he
came
back
he
said
cheerfully
i
believe
i
will
stay
at
elmhurst
de
jarnette
i
think
he
is
going
to
be
better
but
we
will
know
by
midnight
margaret
gripped
the
side
of
the
bed
the
doctor
does
not
usually
stay
when
the
patient
is
better
suspense
was
in
the
air
after
that
word
was
passed
to
the
cabin
that
the
crisis
had
come
and
uncle
tobe
and
his
wife
and
mammy
cely
were
having
a
there
at
nine
philip
was
sleeping
quietly
and
the
doctor
who
had
been
up
the
night
before
went
to
bed
call
me
if
there
is
any
change
he
said
to
the
nurse
and
at
twelve
whether
there
is
or
not
he
advised
margaret
to
do
the
same
but
she
shook
her
head
de
jarnette
the
nurse
said
in
a
low
tone
had
you
better
lie
down
now
you
may
be
needed
later
no
he
said
briefly
it
really
is
necessary
said
margaret
i
prefer
to
stay
she
did
not
combat
it
in
her
heart
she
was
glad
to
have
him
there
through
the
long
hours
they
sat
thus
one
on
each
side
of
philip
bed
the
nurse
watching
them
could
not
but
think
how
strange
it
all
was
midnight
and
the
doctor
brought
them
hope
he
is
doing
finely
nurse
i
could
ask
anything
better
then
to
margaret
who
stood
beside
him
he
said
feelingly
ignoring
de
jarnette
god
is
more
merciful
than
man
my
child
he
has
given
you
back
your
why
my
dear
for
margaret
was
clinging
to
him
weak
and
nerveless
her
head
on
his
fatherly
shoulder
there
there
here
nurse
look
after
her
she
is
all
unstrung
it
is
sleep
she
needs
the
nurse
said
and
no
wonder
and
margaret
allowed
herself
to
be
led
away
it
beats
everything
the
way
these
women
do
grumbled
the
doctor
you
think
they
are
till
the
danger
is
past
and
then
you
find
they
are
a
bundle
of
nerves
after
all
i
stumbled
over
that
old
negro
woman
of
yours
at
the
door
waiting
for
news
i
suppose
de
jarnette
went
to
the
door
name
er
god
marse
richard
how
is
he
i
did
dast
to
speak
when
i
saw
takin
miss
margaret
off
go
to
bed
said
richard
kindly
the
danger
is
past
the
doctor
says
we
may
as
well
go
to
bed
and
leave
him
to
the
nurse
now
said
the
doctor
just
behind
him
i
shall
stay
for
awhile
doctor
when
margaret
woke
from
that
sleep
of
exhaustion
the
first
faint
streaks
of
daylight
were
in
the
sky
she
had
thrown
herself
on
the
bed
dressed
as
she
was
and
slept
for
hours
she
started
up
and
hurried
to
room
a
wax
taper
was
burning
low
the
nurse
was
not
in
sight
and
at
first
she
thought
the
child
was
alone
she
stepped
quickly
to
the
bed
then
as
her
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
she
saw
a
figure
in
the
big
how
is
he
i
i
must
have
slept
a
long
time
he
has
hardly
stirred
poor
little
lamb
he
was
worn
out
too
where
is
the
nurse
i
sent
her
to
bed
there
was
no
use
in
both
of
us
sitting
up
and
she
was
tired
out
and
you
have
sat
here
alone
all
night
and
not
even
been
able
to
read
to
keep
yourself
awake
i
have
found
my
thoughts
quite
sufficient
he
said
chapter
xl
the
unexpected
happens
philip
convalescence
was
a
period
of
enforced
companionship
between
the
two
de
jarnette
had
to
wait
the
lifting
of
the
quarantine
before
he
could
go
back
to
the
city
even
the
court
had
to
wait
for
the
quarantine
the
case
would
have
come
on
before
this
had
it
not
been
for
postponement
on
account
of
it
nobody
had
defied
it
but
john
harcourt
he
had
done
so
twice
the
first
time
richard
received
him
and
took
his
message
to
margaret
watching
her
closely
as
she
read
it
mr
harcourt
oh
yes
i
think
i
will
go
down
if
he
is
afraid
i
to
see
him
he
heard
harcourt
say
a
moment
later
oh
hang
your
quarantine
margaret
i
to
come
margaret
it
had
come
to
that
the
next
time
harcourt
came
the
master
of
the
house
sent
a
servant
for
margaret
and
walked
in
the
garden
while
the
visitor
was
there
if
richard
and
margaret
had
been
companions
in
sorrow
they
certainly
were
now
in
joy
his
relief
that
his
negligence
had
not
been
visited
with
the
punishment
it
deserved
made
him
another
man
than
the
one
she
had
known
as
to
the
girl
she
was
bubbling
over
with
gladness
she
even
jested
with
him
calling
him
unker
wichard
once
then
blushing
at
the
familiarity
and
taking
herself
to
task
for
it
afterwards
but
after
all
she
told
herself
in
impatient
protest
they
had
fought
for
him
side
by
side
why
should
they
not
for
a
few
short
hours
at
least
rejoice
together
he
was
her
foeman
still
but
the
and
its
revelations
forbade
that
he
should
ever
seem
her
bitter
enemy
again
she
would
not
permit
herself
to
think
of
the
case
at
issue
between
them
philip
would
live
that
was
enough
now
let
and
its
complications
take
care
of
she
could
not
be
less
than
grateful
to
him
for
his
tenderness
to
philip
how
sweet
the
apple
blossoms
were
and
the
lilacs
the
bushes
that
richard
mother
planted
grown
to
great
trees
now
how
they
filled
the
air
with
their
fragrance
it
was
a
beautiful
world
oh
a
beautiful
world
a
reaction
came
of
course
as
time
passed
a
depression
natural
enough
perhaps
followed
the
jubilance
of
those
first
days
a
growing
unrest
possessed
her
she
was
not
quite
easy
about
philip
though
he
seemed
to
be
getting
well
the
doctor
came
only
every
other
day
now
or
had
until
the
last
few
days
again
philip
had
taken
a
fancy
just
a
passing
fancy
of
course
to
go
into
the
next
room
which
was
cool
and
dark
and
opened
into
his
she
came
upon
anderson
one
day
lifting
his
eyelids
the
next
day
he
brought
a
friend
out
with
him
she
need
not
be
alarmed
he
told
her
the
case
had
been
rather
an
unusual
one
and
he
had
spoken
to
hawes
about
it
that
was
all
but
he
asked
margaret
to
leave
them
to
themselves
for
a
while
which
seemed
strange
to
her
she
went
down
that
day
to
the
back
porch
where
mammy
cely
was
ironing
and
dropped
down
on
the
old
stone
step
it
was
not
philip
alone
that
troubled
her
this
morning
the
situation
was
pressing
upon
her
more
and
more
each
day
how
would
it
all
end
and
when
it
would
soon
be
time
for
the
quarantine
to
be
lifted
and
then
she
wished
sometimes
that
when
the
case
came
up
she
could
go
into
it
with
all
her
old
hatred
of
richard
de
jarnette
hot
within
her
but
she
knew
in
her
inmost
soul
that
she
never
could
sometimes
it
rose
tempestuously
as
of
old
and
sometimes
it
died
away
as
a
wind
dies
leaving
a
becalmed
ship
upon
a
lifeless
sea
what
was
the
matter
with
her
any
way
she
asked
herself
angrily
what
had
got
into
her
that
she
could
not
control
her
moods
and
why
should
richard
de
jarnette
make
it
all
so
much
harder
for
her
by
being
first
one
thing
and
then
another
he
was
a
regular
jekyll
and
mammy
cely
she
said
suddenly
in
pursuance
of
this
thought
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
all
of
us
two
persons
one
evil
and
the
other
good
sometimes
one
is
on
top
and
sometimes
the
other
i
get
tired
of
the
fight
that
so
honey
said
mammy
cely
never
pausing
in
her
work
jes
the
way
it
is
ef
you
was
standin
in
the
pulpit
you
that
doctrine
any
better
what
you
have
humph
do
i
know
the
good

fightin
the
bad
cely
in
me
for
forty
years

and

yaas
that
the
way
we
has
to
fight
a
few
days
after
this
margaret
was
sitting
at
the
window
in
room
late
in
the
afternoon
the
quarantine
had
been
raised
and
richard
had
gone
to
town
that
day
for
the
first
time
somehow
it
had
been
a
trying
day
philip
had
been
restless
without
him
she
had
been
telling
him
a
story
but
it
had
not
been
a
very
satisfactory
one
philip
had
had
to
make
frequent
suggestions
and
amendments
for
she
was
and
not
in
her
best
vein
her
eyes
wandered
down
the
long
avenue
of
elms
that
had
given
the
place
its
name
what
monarchs
they
were
well
might
they
be
called
the
kings
of
the
they
led
clear
down
to
the
gate
the
big
gate
that
philip
had
been
so
proud
to
open
for
his
uncle
how
jealous
she
had
been
over
that
and
how
foolishly
one
could
hardly
see
the
gate
from
this
window
she
leaned
further
out
yes
there
was
the
gate
and
mama
said
philip
are
you
looking
for
unker
wichard
no
she
said
with
a
sharpness
most
unusual
i
am
looking
at
the
elms
ai
it
most
time
for
unker
wichard
to
come
asked
philip
querulously
he
at
least
had
missed
him
his
mother
did
not
answer
except
to
say
as
mammy
cely
came
in
with
some
newly
hatched
chickens
to
show
him
i
run
down
and
get
you
some
lilacs
dearie
in
the
garden
laid
out
after
the
fashion
of
a
half
century
ago
were
the
lilac
trees
white
and
purple
now
in
their
glory
the
garden
kept
immaculate
by
uncle
tobe
unremitting
care
was
as
richard
de
jarnette
mother
had
left
it
with
beds
of
flowers
edged
with
box
at
the
further
end
of
it
was
an
arbor
covered
not
with
grapes
but
with
a
luxuriance
of
wistaria
the
long
clusters
of
which
hung
down
through
the
trellised
roof
the
old
wistaria
too
was
a
tree
gnarled
and
twisted
it
had
broken
down
several
arbors
mammy
cely
said
but
richard
would
not
have
it
destroyed
margaret
sat
on
the
seat
under
the
wistaria
she
had
torn
off
the
lilacs
ruthlessly
and
had
her
hot
face
buried
in
their
cool
depths
on
the
way
hither
she
had
seen
a
horseman
cantering
up
the
avenue
she
would
stay
here
until
he
had
left
philip
room
and
gone
downstairs
she
did
not
wish
to
see
him
she
would
be
glad
if
she
could
never
see
him
again
there
had
been
a
truce
between
them
yes
of
course
there
to
be
while
philip
was
so
ill
but
that
was
over
now
he
was
her
enemy
after
all
must
always
be
no
matter
which
way
the
thing
was
settled
it
was
best
that
she
should
see
as
little
of
him
as
possible
of
course
she
would
have
to
remain
here
as
long
as
philip
needed
her
her
heart
stood
still
at
the
thought
of
what
would
happen
when
he
did
not
need
her
but
she
would
manage
it
so
as
to
be
away
when
he
was
in
philip
room
that
would
be
better
far
better
then
looking
up
she
saw
the
man
she
was
planning
to
avoid
coming
down
the
walk
toward
her
i
am
looking
for
you
he
said
baring
his
head
sprinkled
with
gray
to
the
soft
spring
air
philip
said
you
were
among
the
lilacs
she
pointed
to
the
fragrant
mass
in
her
lap
glad
of
their
confirmation
how
has
he
been
better
i
think
yes
i
am
sure
he
is
better
he
sat
down
beside
her
that
sounds
as
if
you
were
keeping
something
back
what
is
it
his
voice
was
so
kind
that
foolish
tears
got
into
her
voice
i
feel
as
if
something
were
being
kept
back
from
me
she
said
passionately
that
is
just
what
the
trouble
is
it
it
seems
silly
in
me
to
go
to
you
with
every
little
thing
but
i
have
no
one
here
i
do
want
you
to
feel
that
anything
which
concerns
philip
is
too
little
or
too
great
to
come
to
me
with
he
said
gravely
remember
always
that
my
interest
in
him
is
second
only
to
your
own
now
what
is
it
well
if
philip
is
getting
along
so
well
and
he
certainly
seems
to
be
why
should
anderson
bring
other
doctors
out
here
to
see
him
other
doctors
he
repeated
with
a
startled
look
what
do
you
mean
i
told
you
about
the
one
who
was
here
a
few
days
ago
yes
i
think
you
said
anderson
told
you
there
were
some
features
about
the
case
that
made
it
an
unusual
one
and
that
he
brought
the
doctor
out
to
see
him
for
that
reason
he
did
but
he
brought
out
another
one
somebody
from
johns
hopkins
i
think
they
said
and
when
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
stay
in
the
room
this
time
anderson
sent
me
off
on
some
fool
errand
to
get
something
that
i
know
he
did
want
and
when
i
got
back
whatever
they
wanted
to
do
was
done
but
just
as
i
got
into
the
room
i
heard
this
man
say
long
as
it
affects
only
the
outer
circumference
of
something
i
could
not
catch
that
is
little
to
fear
but
if
and
then
he
saw
me
and
stopped
he
did
not
make
light
of
her
fears
he
met
them
with
sober
sense
i
should
worry
over
this
i
think
you
know
that
anderson
can
be
trusted
if
there
is
anything
you
need
to
know
he
will
tell
you
besides
you
are
not
even
sure
that
they
were
talking
about
philip
there
is
nothing
alarming
about
a
physician
taking
a
brother
practitioner
to
see
a
case
what
time
will
the
doctor
be
here
i
may
wait
and
see
him
myself
now
do
worry
over
it
any
more
how
easy
it
is
to
learn
to
rely
on
one
stronger
than
ourselves
margaret
went
back
to
the
house
strengthened
and
helped
richard
de
jarnette
had
calmed
her
fears
as
he
would
have
quieted
philip
she
felt
almost
humiliated
that
he
should
have
such
power
but
she
was
comforted
after
that
talk
in
the
arbor
it
did
not
seem
quite
practicable
to
put
into
effect
her
determination
to
absent
herself
when
he
was
in
room
in
fact
that
very
night
they
sat
before
the
open
fire
which
was
kindled
as
night
fell
she
with
philip
in
her
arms
and
he
in
his
across
from
her
and
though
there
was
not
much
conversation
between
them
there
was
companionship
in
his
presence
their
mutual
interest
in
philip
was
a
bond
between
them
now
that
she
was
so
isolated
from
her
friends
he
had
been
very
gentle
to
her
in
the
arbor
mama
sing
to
me
said
philip
and
margaret
sang
softly
the
cradle
songs
he
loved
they
made
a
sweet
picture
as
they
sat
thus
but
in
the
midst
of
her
songs
richard
got
up
abruptly
and
went
into
the
other
room
drawing
a
great
breath
when
he
got
there
the
nurse
had
been
reading
here
but
had
gone
he
stood
a
moment
looking
around
the
room
it
was
strangely
decorated
if
decoration
it
could
be
called
on
the
walls
were
madonna
pictures
of
every
name
and
age
in
his
present
mood
it
moved
him
strangely
to
see
them
it
seemed
as
if
in
her
desperate
fear
of
being
supplanted
she
had
tried
to
keep
always
before
philip
the
close
and
tender
bond
between
mother
and
child
nothing
else
could
explain
all
these
pictures
his
eyes
went
from
one
to
another
pausing
longest
before
that
one
of
modern
times
which
has
been
called
the
madonna
of
the
slums
that
seemed
to
him
the
truest
of
them
all
and
to
have
the
most
pathos
here
was
no
virgin
of
the
immaculate
conception
upheld
by
a
knowledge
of
her
mission
only
the
human
mother
bearing
on
her
arm
divinely
strong
the
sleeping
child
he
wanted
to
take
it
from
her
and
rest
her
arm
her
tired
arm
there
was
no
halo
here
nothing
but
the
shawl
the
insignia
of
the
lowly
about
the
patient
face
he
recalled
something
he
had
read
once
about
how
in
the
elder
days
of
art
the
masters
painted
a
nimbus
round
the
mother
head
leaving
her
face
often
inane
and
weak
but
how
later
with
a
deeper
insight
if
not
a
subtler
skill
he
put
the
halo
in
the
face
as
he
looked
at
the
pictures
with
this
thought
in
his
mind
his
eye
fell
on
the
photograph
of
margaret
and
philip
on
the
mantel
he
took
it
up
and
looked
at
it
yes
the
halo
was
there
as
surely
as
in
the
face
of
virgin
mother
they
all
had
it
he
turned
the
picture
to
the
wall
with
a
quick
frown
this
was
brave
preparation
he
was
making
for
the
trial
which
would
soon
be
on
now
as
he
turned
the
face
from
him
the
words
italicized
stood
out
from
the
printed
slip
scrap
alone
i
hold
of
all
that
once
was
he
pushed
the
picture
under
a
book
and
went
out
of
the
room
anderson
did
not
come
out
till
afternoon
but
when
he
did
the
baltimore
man
was
with
him
they
went
almost
directly
to
the
let
me
have
the
nurse
please
this
time
the
doctor
said
and
margaret
frightened
and
half
indignant
was
left
outside
with
richard
when
the
consultation
was
at
an
end
the
baltimore
man
would
not
sit
down
excusing
his
haste
on
the
ground
that
he
must
catch
a
train
de
jarnette
followed
him
into
the
hall
doctor
ca
stop
said
the
doctor
curtly
anderson
will
say
to
the
mother
all
that
needs
to
be
said
plainly
he
did
not
recognize
de
jarnette
rights
in
the
case
anderson
margaret
was
saying
when
he
stepped
back
into
the
room
what
is
it
i
know
for
a
moment
the
doctor
did
not
reply
when
he
did
it
was
not
in
answer
to
her
question
de
jarnette
will
you
sit
down
she
dropped
into
the
proffered
chair
there
was
something
in
his
voice
that
took
her
strength
de
jarnette
will
you
too
be
seated
i
have
something
of
of
importance
to
communicate
and
it
should
be
said
to
both
richard
de
jarnette
was
leaning
on
the
mantel
he
did
not
change
his
position
go
on
he
said
briefly
the
doctor
gave
a
slight
shrug
and
turned
his
back
upon
him
my
child
he
said
very
gently
i
want
to
talk
with
you
about
the
nature
of
this
disease
we
are
not
so
much
afraid
of
scarletina
or
scarlet
fever
as
you
call
it
as
we
used
to
be
we
know
better
how
to
manage
it
yes
murmured
margaret
not
knowing
to
what
all
this
tended
he
really
seems
to
be
recovering
more
quickly
than
i
had
even
hoped
but
ye
es
ye
es
continued
the
doctor
making
carefully
spaced
lines
on
a
scrap
of
paper
and
avoiding
her
eye
you
see
it
is
not
the
disease
that
we
are
most
afraid
of
that
is
generally
easy
enough
it
yields
to
treatment
but
it
is
the
complications
that
sometimes
arise
the
after
effects
he
was
looking
into
her
face
now
and
she
grew
white
to
the
lips
doctor
yes
with
a
slight
shake
of
the
head
it
is
the
after
effects
i
have
known
many
children
to
be
left
with
permanent
ear
or
eye
trouble
from
scarlet
fever
possibly
the
danger
may
be
averted
we
can
never
tell
at
first
but
mama
margaret
stepped
hastily
into
the
next
room
in
her
heart
which
had
divined
the
truth
she
was
thankful
for
a
reprieve
what
do
you
mean
asked
richard
de
jarnette
harshly
driven
by
a
great
fear
why
do
you
torture
her
so
say
plainly
what
you
mean
the
outraged
physician
turned
upon
him
savagely
i
mean
sir
he
said
with
some
stiffness
that
this
lady
child
who
has
unfortunately
been
allowed
to
contract
scarlet
fever
is
in
great
danger
of
going
blind
do
i
make
myself
plain
his
voice
was
low
but
so
intense
in
its
indignation
that
it
penetrated
to
the
room
beyond
richard
de
jarnette
staggered
back
as
from
a
blow
good
god
he
turned
abjectly
toward
the
doorway
between
the
two
rooms
where
stood
margaret
white
as
death
but
with
face
transfigured
was
her
opportunity
and
what
would
philip
do
without
her
if
with
a
swift
movement
she
fell
on
her
knees
at
his
feet
and
stretched
out
her
hands
richard
oh
richard
she
cried
her
heart
in
her
eyes
will
you
give
him
to
me
if
he
is
blind
the
old
doctor
turned
to
the
window
with
a
groan
and
richard
de
jarnette
have
you
ever
stood
before
a
monarch
of
the
forest
marked
for
the
woodman
ax
have
you
noted
its
majestic
spread
its
trunk
of
massive
girth
its
towering
branches
where
the
crow
whose
birth
was
in
their
tops
grew
old
and
died
have
you
stood
thus
and
marveled
not
that
so
magnificent
a
thing
could
fall
by
hand
of
puny
man
and
have
you
further
noted
how
it
stood
at
last
majestic
still
but
with
its
strength
so
sapped
and
its
potentiality
so
meshed
that
any
child
might
cause
its
overthrow
for
weeks
the
mighty
oak
of
this
man
pride
and
obstinacy
had
been
preparing
for
its
fall
weak
hands
they
were
which
had
given
the
blows
a
woman
and
a
child
no
one
suspected
that
its
strength
was
gone
he
least
of
all
but
when
the
crucial
moment
came
it
needed
but
a
baby
groping
touch
to
lay
it
low
he
took
her
hands
and
raised
her
to
her
feet
margaret
margaret
he
said
brokenly
from
this
hour
come
what
may
the
child
is
yours
the
door
closed
behind
him
and
the
sound
of
his
heavy
tread
echoed
through
the
hall
but
she
did
not
hear
the
old
doctor
wiped
his
eyes
looked
cautiously
around
and
stole
from
the
room
but
she
did
not
perceive
she
was
on
her
knees
beside
her
child
sobbing
as
though
her
heart
would
break
chapter
xli
under
the
wistaria
it
was
three
whole
days
before
margaret
saw
richard
de
jarnette
again
she
was
wounded
and
outraged
beyond
the
power
of
words
to
express
at
his
apparent
neglect
under
the
circumstances
it
seemed
almost
brutal
she
did
not
even
have
pennybacker
with
her
for
when
the
doctor
went
for
her
he
found
her
so
unwell
herself
that
he
had
not
told
her
about
philip
fearing
that
she
would
overtax
her
strength
to
go
to
them
margaret
agreed
with
him
that
this
was
best
but
her
heart
cried
out
for
somebody
to
lean
upon
as
night
came
on
she
found
herself
listening
for
his
step
with
an
eagerness
that
appalled
her
appalled
her
and
filled
her
with
rage
and
humiliation
as
well
but
she
did
not
hear
it
even
philip
felt
the
restlessness
which
comes
from
an
expected
presence
delayed
fretting
i
want
unker
wichard
to
hold
me
mama
will
hold
you
darling
uncle
richard
is
not
here
but
i
want
unker
wichard
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
heart
would
break
not
only
had
this
man
blighted
both
their
lives
but
he
had
stolen
her
place
in
the
heart
and
then
left
them
it
was
the
way
with
men
philip
was
so
insistent
that
mammy
cely
said
at
last
yo
uncle
richard
ai
gwine
come
back
honey
he
done
say
so
then
to
de
jarnette
no
i
do
know
whar
he
went
but
look
lak
he
was
powerful
anxious
to
git
away
for
some
cause
whatsomever
it
did
so
she
had
not
been
told
about
the
new
danger
the
doctor
came
out
early
the
next
day
and
had
a
plain
talk
with
her
he
is
threatened
with
choroiditis
an
affection
of
the
eyes
that
sometimes
follows
febrile
diseases
so
long
as
the
trouble
is
confined
to
the
outer
regions
of
the
choroid
it
was
not
dangerous
but
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
say
to
you
that
if
it
should
attack
the
central
field
of
vision
it
would
be
likely
to
result
in
gradual
blindness
but
he
has
many
things
in
his
favor
and
we
will
hope
for
the
best
in
the
meantime
he
should
be
under
the
care
of
a
specialist
i
do
not
feel
competent
to
treat
him
it
was
this
that
i
was
intending
to
say
to
you
yesterday
when
the
worst
was
forced
upon
you
by
your
unfortunately
overhearing
the
words
between
de
jarnette
and
myself
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
tried
to
get
helsor
a
washington
specialist
out
to
see
him
but
that
he
was
ill
and
could
not
come
he
had
wanted
to
get
expert
advice
before
saying
anything
to
alarm
her
etc
perhaps
it
might
be
a
good
plan
to
take
him
to
johns
hopkins
to
the
hospital
or
even
to
philadelphia
if
she
desired
he
would
go
with
her
and
make
arrangements
for
his
admission
what
did
she
think
about
it
she
felt
that
she
could
not
give
him
an
answer
now
that
she
was
the
sole
arbiter
of
philip
fortunes
she
was
strangely
loth
to
take
upon
herself
the
burden
of
decision
if
she
could
only
talk
it
over
with
with
pennybacker
she
told
herself
weakly
it
was
pennybacker
she
wanted
to
take
counsel
with
in
her
inmost
heart
the
one
we
can
not
delude
she
knew
it
was
richard
richard
de
jarnette
the
hot
blood
crimsoned
her
face
at
the
shame
of
it
in
these
weeks
in
the
sick
room
she
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
leaning
upon
his
judgment
which
was
always
calm
and
dispassionate
when
she
had
tried
to
excuse
this
to
the
doctor
he
had
replied
in
a
way
that
it
was
not
unnatural
nor
to
be
regretted
in
a
case
of
severe
illness
the
person
closest
to
the
patient
was
not
usually
the
one
that
had
the
best
judgment
she
reminded
herself
often
afterwards
of
this
saying
that
that
was
why
she
relied
so
on
him
now
that
he
was
gone
she
felt
strengthless
judge
kirtley
came
out
on
the
first
train
and
walked
over
from
the
station
to
tell
her
the
astounding
news
that
de
jarnette
had
thrown
up
the
case
he
had
been
to
his
judge
kirtley
office
late
the
afternoon
before
to
say
that
he
desired
to
have
the
case
settled
out
of
court
and
was
prepared
to
relinquish
all
claims
to
the
child
under
the
will
now
and
hereafter
did
he
tell
you
about
philip
philip
no
nothing
more
than
i
have
said
he
seemed
in
great
haste
to
get
away
for
some
reason
and
not
inclined
to
talk
what
is
it
about
philip
he
doing
all
right
is
he
when
he
heard
from
her
the
story
of
the
doctor
fears
and
of
renunciation
of
the
child
his
scorn
and
wrath
knew
no
bounds
the
cur
he
cried
the
cowardly
cur
then
to
his
amazement
margaret
turned
upon
him
it
is
not
that
she
said
firmly
with
an
intuitive
conviction
that
leaped
past
the
very
natural
view
the
judge
had
taken
it
was
not
the
fear
of
having
a
blind
child
to
take
care
of
that
led
him
to
this
step
it
was
something
else
what
demanded
the
judge
will
you
tell
me
what
no
she
said
i
can
not
tell
you
what
but
this
much
i
am
sure
of
it
was
not
that
judge
kirtley
took
off
his
glasses
polished
them
carefully
and
put
them
on
again
then
he
looked
over
them
into
the
face
of
his
client
well
margaret
the
ways
of
a
woman
and
the
working
of
a
woman
mind
are
truly
past
finding
out
you
defend
richard
de
jarnette
i
do
defend
him
she
cried
hotly
except
against
injustice
anybody
is
entitled
to
fair
play
especially
the
absent
you
have
always
urged
me
to
look
at
both
sides
yes
he
remarked
dryly
but
heretofore
you
have
never
been
able
to
do
it
she
could
not
have
told
why
she
did
it
now
she
protested
to
herself
that
it
was
only
in
common
justice
that
she
had
spoken
but
the
truth
is
that
love
is
the
great
discerner
it
had
cleared
her
vision
and
quickened
her
understanding
unacknowledged
feared
and
fought
against
as
the
feeling
was
in
the
desperate
spirit
which
recognized
this
as
a
death
struggle
it
was
yet
forcing
her
to
see
with
its
eyes
henceforth
her
judgments
of
this
man
would
be
whether
she
would
or
not
truer
juster
more
righteous
judgments
her
comprehension
of
motive
where
he
was
concerned
more
subtly
discriminating
it
is
the
of
love
it
was
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
before
he
came
three
nights
with
their
deadening
suffocating
pall
of
darkness
had
fallen
upon
her
darkness
and
the
that
drove
her
wild
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
he
was
gone
as
victor
had
then
as
suddenly
as
he
had
departed
he
appeared
before
her
one
afternoon
out
in
the
grape
arbor
whither
in
her
restlessness
she
had
gone
she
and
philip
both
loved
the
place
and
often
walked
there
when
she
came
to
see
him
running
races
sometimes
up
and
down
its
dim
aisles
through
which
the
sun
flickered
intermittently
now
that
the
wistaria
was
out
richard
de
jarnette
coming
home
unexpectedly
one
day
just
before
philip
was
taken
sick
heard
shrieks
of
childish
laughter
there
and
forgetting
that
it
was
day
at
elmhurst
went
down
to
find
out
what
made
his
nephew
so
uproariously
gay
what
he
saw
was
the
woman
who
to
him
had
always
been
cold
and
stately
chasing
the
child
shrieking
with
delight
up
and
down
and
in
and
around
the
arbor
catching
him
at
last
and
smothering
him
with
kisses
taking
toll
while
philip
releasing
himself
and
poising
in
ecstatic
anticipation
cried
coaxingly
do
it
again
they
had
not
seen
him
and
he
slipped
away
fairly
shocked
at
what
her
face
could
be
it
was
a
revelation
to
him
of
one
side
of
her
that
he
had
never
seen
somehow
it
intoxicated
him
but
if
he
was
intoxicated
by
a
look
he
was
sobered
by
a
thought
of
what
other
simple
natural
joys
had
he
deprived
her
and
the
child
mammy
cely
had
told
him
once
that
the
two
had
little
dinners
in
the
arbor
with
a
cloth
on
the
table
and
little
cakes
and
animal
crackers
that
she
had
brought
him
some
days
she
said
looks
lak
she
is
a
plumb
child
with
him
she
does
it
so
he
furgit
how
to
play
he
wondered
uneasily
afterwards
if
children
really
did
forget
how
to
play
as
he
came
down
the
leafy
arch
in
search
of
her
the
recollection
of
that
romp
pierced
him
like
a
knife
a
blind
child
would
never
play
like
that
so
soft
were
his
footfalls
on
the
thick
grass
that
he
was
nearly
upon
her
before
she
heard
him
then
turning
her
head
and
seeing
who
it
was
she
started
to
rise
do
get
up
he
said
taking
the
seat
beside
her
i
want
to
talk
with
you
if
the
face
that
looked
into
his
was
unresponsive
it
was
because
she
was
trying
so
hard
to
still
the
tumultuous
beating
of
her
heart
it
was
shameful
that
it
should
throb
so
at
sight
of
him
she
would
never
let
him
know
that
she
had
had
a
thought
of
him
in
all
these
interminable
days
but
when
he
spoke
again
so
gentle
was
his
voice
so
like
her
father
that
she
had
hard
work
to
keep
back
the
tears
margaret
my
child
did
you
think
i
had
gone
away
and
left
you
to
bear
it
alone
the
lump
in
her
throat
was
like
that
she
used
to
have
in
her
youthful
days
did
he
say
margaret
my
child
just
as
her
father
used
to
say
he
might
know
she
could
keep
from
crying
then
i
have
been
to
new
york
she
made
no
pretense
of
answering
him
it
seemed
inexpressibly
cruel
to
her
that
he
should
have
taken
this
time
to
go
to
new
york
unfeeling
that
he
should
tell
her
of
it
in
palliation
of
his
neglect
i
went
to
consult
an
oculist
at
the
word
oculist
all
thought
of
herself
of
him
was
gone
an
oculist
oh
what
did
he
say
nothing
definite
of
course
until
he
has
seen
him
he
will
be
down
in
the
morning
you
had
to
go
she
said
still
unreconciled
you
could
not
send
no
i
went
directly
from
here
to
helsor
a
fine
oculist
in
washington
i
thought
that
perhaps
i
could
get
him
out
here
before
night
when
i
reached
his
office
i
found
him
quite
sick
and
unable
to
leave
the
house
though
he
saw
me
he
was
not
able
to
take
any
cases
and
he
advised
me
to
go
personally
to
abelthorpe
of
new
york
and
if
possible
to
bring
him
down
here
to
examine
philip
did
you
see
him
she
asked
eagerly
yes
at
last
but
i
had
to
wait
two
days
to
do
it
he
had
been
called
out
of
the
city
and
was
not
back
until
yesterday
i
wrote
you
at
once
from
new
york
but
i
have
just
found
the
letter
on
my
table
with
some
other
mail
this
was
the
explanation
then
how
simple
it
was
and
his
haste
had
been
for
philip
sake
i
should
not
have
gone
if
there
had
been
any
other
way
but
helsor
thought
that
if
i
could
see
abelthorpe
personally
i
would
be
more
apt
to
secure
his
services
it
was
a
fortunate
thing
i
did
for
i
think
no
letter
however
urgent
would
have
brought
him
he
is
on
the
point
of
going
to
europe
when
i
explained
the
circumstances
however
and
named
the
fee
he
might
have
added
he
agreed
to
come
it
was
hard
waiting
margaret
knowing
that
you
were
alone
she
looked
away
from
him
fearing
that
he
might
see
the
wretchedness
of
those
days
graven
on
her
face
but
i
am
glad
i
did
he
went
on
to
tell
her
what
the
doctor
had
said
he
gave
me
great
hope
though
he
says
that
such
cases
require
care
and
patience
oh
i
will
give
him
that
i
will
give
up
my
life
to
him
willingly
gladly
if
only
perhaps
i
would
better
go
back
with
the
doctor
philip
will
be
able
to
travel
you
forget
that
he
is
just
starting
abroad
he
goes
in
a
very
few
days
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
hopeless
perplexity
that
wrung
his
heart
from
what
i
have
learned
of
abelthorpe
i
am
very
anxious
for
him
to
have
the
care
of
philip
case
i
am
aware
he
was
speaking
guardedly
as
one
who
does
not
feel
sure
of
his
ground
that
i
have
no
right
to
dictate
your
movements
in
the
matter
margaret
as
i
have
formally
relinquished
the
control
of
philip
but
i
hope
i
have
not
overstepped
the
bounds
i
have
arranged
with
abelthorpe
conditionally
of
course
that
if
you
are
willing
and
he
still
thinks
it
best
after
seeing
philip
that
you
will
go
abroad
with
him
so
that
he
can
take
charge
of
philip
at
once
as
his
attending
physician
to
go
abroad
she
faltered
yes
he
thinks
a
sea
voyage
may
do
him
good
says
they
rely
a
good
deal
upon
constitutional
treatment
and
but
i
could
not
go
alone
margaret
said
looking
up
at
him
hopelessly
her
heart
was
sinking
unaccountably
at
the
thought
of
drifting
out
into
the
great
world
with
a
sick
child
his
mouth
contracted
suddenly
he
looked
away
from
her
and
his
right
hand
out
of
sight
gripped
the
bench
on
which
they
sat
he
got
up
abruptly
and
walked
to
the
entrance
of
the
arbor
she
thought
he
was
listening
to
something
when
he
returned
his
features
were
as
immobile
as
usual
no
you
could
not
go
alone
but
pennybacker
i
am
sure
would
go
with
you
and
of
course
you
would
have
mammy
cely
she
found
herself
as
wax
in
his
hands
she
could
not
plan
for
herself
if
only
the
ocean
were
not
so
broad
there
is
one
thing
more
margaret
a
simple
matter
of
business
it
may
have
been
a
simple
matter
but
it
seemed
difficult
for
him
to
begin
it
when
philip
came
to
me
last
fall
he
said
speaking
gravely
but
in
a
tone
i
made
a
will
by
which
everything
i
had
was
to
go
to
him
at
my
death
i
have
since
taken
steps
to
settle
one
half
on
him
now
in
such
a
way
that
while
i
shall
still
have
the
care
of
it
the
income
will
be
immediately
available
for
his
use
no
answering
the
flush
that
swept
over
her
pale
face
i
have
not
forgotten
what
you
said
she
had
told
him
once
that
she
would
rather
philip
would
starve
than
be
dependant
on
him
but
you
ca
keep
a
man
from
doing
what
he
wants
to
with
his
own
it
is
settled
poor
little
chap
it
is
all
the
reparation
i
can
make
as
for
you
margaret
he
went
on
i
do
not
ask
you
to
forgive
me
i
do
not
expect
you
to
forgive
if
there
be
an
unpardonable
sin
i
think
i
have
committed
it
for
i
have
sinned
against
you
against
womanhood
and
against
nature
when
i
think
of
you
as
i
have
seen
you
every
minute
of
these
three
days
with
what
may
be
a
blind
child
in
your
arms
i
feel
that
the
pitying
mother
of
god
could
hardly
forgive
you
blame
yourself
unjustly
for
that
she
said
with
quick
generosity
it
might
have
happened
if
he
had
been
with
me
it
would
not
have
happened
if
he
had
been
with
you
you
would
have
looked
to
his
ways
you
would
not
have
been
so
immersed
in
business
that
you
would
have
neglected
a
signal
that
meant
danger
to
your
child
but
i
poor
blind
stubborn
fool
let
us
not
talk
about
it
any
more
she
said
gently
there
was
something
in
his
remorse
that
touched
her
deeply
it
is
done
and
it
can
not
be
undone
i
have
never
thought
it
was
from
any
lack
of
love
for
philip
you
simply
violated
a
law
of
nature
and
nature
laws
are
the
laws
of
god
he
never
intended
men
to
have
the
care
of
little
children
she
would
have
been
more
than
human
if
she
had
not
said
that
much
once
more
he
got
up
abruptly
walking
to
the
further
end
of
the
arbor
and
back
again
she
thought
she
had
angered
him
when
he
spoke
it
was
standing
the
green
pathway
between
them
instead
of
at
her
side
you
beaten
me
margaret
he
said
with
a
shake
of
the
head
he
was
looking
down
at
her
with
a
half
satirical
smile
on
his
lips
but
it
was
of
the
lips
only
there
was
no
lightening
of
the
gloom
in
the
eyes
bent
upon
her
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
complete
my
rout
has
been
she
looked
up
quickly
you
gave
him
to
me
voluntarily
yes
i
gave
him
to
you
voluntarily
and
therein
lies
your
victory
if
the
case
had
been
brought
to
issue
and
decided
against
me
there
would
have
been
excuse
for
my
defeat
as
it
is
i
have
simply
been
beaten
by
a
woman
and
the
almighty
it
is
hard
to
fight
against
the
almighty
yes
and
as
hard
i
find
to
fight
against
a
woman
in
the
right
perhaps
the
two
mean
the
same
thing
i
rather
think
they
do
then
a
tinge
of
bitterness
came
into
his
voice
of
course
the
world
your
world
and
mine
will
have
pleasant
things
to
say
about
this
latest
chapter
in
the
scandal
of
de
jarnette
de
jarnette
the
natural
inference
brutally
stated
will
be
that
i
gave
him
up
when
i
found
that
i
might
have
a
blind
child
on
my
hands
i
could
expect
them
to
say
otherwise
the
world
judges
by
appearances
and
appearances
are
certainly
against
me
well
i
do
care
much
about
what
it
thinks
the
world
and
i
have
never
been
on
very
good
terms
i
have
hated
it
and
it
has
hated
me
i
am
more
concerned
about
what
his
eyes
with
their
dumb
pleading
finished
the
sentence
and
she
answered
them
you
know
i
do
not
think
it
she
said
i
have
thought
hard
and
bitter
things
about
you
and
with
cause
but
not
that
i
have
never
for
one
moment
thought
that
he
took
a
step
across
the
arbor
with
outstretched
hand
grasping
the
one
she
gave
him
as
man
grasps
the
hand
of
man
then
dropping
it
he
went
back
to
his
place
opposite
her
you
have
a
right
to
think
hard
things
about
me
he
said
i
have
been
hard
i
never
intended
to
let
my
heart
soften
to
you
i
meant
to
hold
out
to
the
last
but
she
broke
the
silence
that
fell
upon
them
then
by
saying
there
is
one
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
before
i
go
away
and
this
may
be
our
last
talk
together
why
have
you
been
so
bitterly
cruel
to
me
he
looked
at
her
but
did
not
answer
at
first
she
went
on
i
thought
it
was
from
something
hard
in
your
nature
or
because
you
hated
me
or
bore
something
up
against
me
i
could
not
tell
what
but
since
we
have
been
together
over
philip
and
i
have
seen
how
gentle
you
are
with
him
it
does
not
seem
that
you
could
ever
have
been
wantonly
cruel
nor
that
you
quite
hated
me
what
was
the
reason
miss
margaret
miss
margaret
it
was
mammy
cely
voice
and
at
this
moment
her
rotund
form
appeared
at
the
entrance
to
the
arbor
here
a
letter
fur
you
will
you
tell
me
some
time
she
asked
insistently
as
the
woman
came
nearer
she
might
never
have
so
good
an
opportunity
again
harcourt
waitin
fur
you
miss
margaret
richard
de
jarnette
face
hardened
there
is
nothing
to
tell
he
said
she
took
the
letter
and
read
it
hastily
it
is
from
pennybacker
she
said
reading
aloud
with
an
awed
look
on
her
face
is
worse
i
think
this
is
the
end
she
wants
to
see
you
and
de
jarnette
together
and
will
not
be
denied
come
at
once
chapter
xlii
the
confessional
will
you
go
with
harcourt
and
myself
she
asked
there
will
be
plenty
of
room
i
think
no
i
will
go
by
train
and
meet
you
there
when
he
reached
the
house
on
massachusetts
avenue
she
had
not
yet
come
pennybacker
took
him
into
the
parlor
i
am
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
tell
you
something
of
the
history
before
margaret
comes
she
said
the
poor
child
has
something
on
her
mind
that
she
feels
she
must
tell
you
no
i
do
know
what
it
is
when
she
had
finished
that
pitiful
story
of
woman
trust
and
perfidy
his
face
was
haggard
he
could
guess
the
name
they
both
thought
that
her
talk
would
be
a
plea
for
the
child
margaret
came
at
last
and
they
were
taken
to
the
sick
girl
room
she
is
very
weak
whispered
pennybacker
at
the
door
but
perfectly
clear
in
mind
for
the
last
few
days
she
has
been
in
great
mental
distress
about
something
it
is
only
since
i
promised
her
to
send
for
you
both
that
she
has
been
quiet
let
her
do
the
talking
in
her
own
way
at
the
bedside
of
the
girl
de
jarnette
felt
a
great
wave
of
compassion
sweep
over
him
she
was
so
young
rosalie
this
is
de
jarnette
he
held
out
his
hand
but
she
would
not
take
it
and
he
passed
to
a
seat
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
where
he
could
see
her
without
being
himself
under
the
eyes
of
any
of
them
when
margaret
bent
over
her
smoothing
her
hair
patting
the
worn
cheek
and
smiling
into
her
eyes
the
mental
anguish
of
the
last
two
days
of
which
pennybacker
had
spoken
seemed
to
break
out
afresh
oh
madam
do
not
take
my
hand
it
is
stained
with
blood
if
when
you
have
heard
all
why
rosalie
my
poor
girl
margaret
said
soothingly
you
have
done
nothing
that
you
should
plead
to
me
for
forgiveness
your
greatest
sin
has
been
to
yourself
and
your
child
and
even
then
you
have
been
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
oh
madam
you
do
not
know
it
is
this
that
i
have
brought
you
to
this
room
to
hear
margaret
had
drawn
a
chair
to
the
bedside
thinking
that
the
girl
could
tell
her
story
whatever
it
was
better
to
her
than
to
a
stranger
what
is
it
rosalie
tell
me
then
if
it
will
ease
your
mind
in
the
least
what
have
you
ever
done
to
me
what
have
i
done
she
asks
me
what
i
have
done
oh
madam
look
away
from
me
and
listen
was
i
who
who
killed
him
she
is
delirious
said
margaret
in
an
undertone
and
laid
a
wet
cloth
on
her
head
but
richard
de
jarnette
bent
forward
watching
the
woman
with
a
quick
comprehension
that
took
in
all
she
said
and
was
supplying
more
i
am
not
delirious
said
rosalie
sadly
i
think
i
have
been
all
these
month
that
i
have
had
the
shelter
of
your
roof
and
eaten
your
bread
now
i
have
come
to
myself
and
whatever
the
result
you
must
know
the
truth
what
does
she
mean
asked
margaret
turning
to
the
others
let
her
tell
her
story
in
her
own
way
suggested
pennybacker
she
saw
that
the
girl
breath
was
becoming
labored
yes
listen
to
me
while
i
have
strength
to
talk
and
then
forgive
if
you
can
the
man
that
wrought
my
ruin
was
your
husband
and
i
killed
him
my
husband
died
by
accident
margaret
said
with
white
lips
he
said
so
with
his
dying
breath
then
he
spoke
falsely
even
in
death
said
the
woman
for
i
killed
him
but
do
you
remember
you
told
me
that
your
betrayer
died
from
natural
causes
i
told
you
that
he
died
a
natural
death
he
did
it
was
by
my
hand
let
her
go
on
margaret
you
know
that
day
you
came
to
the
hospital
and
wanted
to
take
my
boy
because
he
looked
like
yours
and
because
you
were
so
desolate
yes
and
then
you
heard
my
story
and
were
so
filled
with
pity
for
a
poor
sinning
girl
that
you
brought
me
to
your
own
home
and
put
my
child
into
my
empty
arms
and
said
much
of
life
joy
you
shall
have
oh
i
have
never
forgotten
those
words
do
you
remember
that
yes
said
margaret
it
was
because
your
own
heart
was
sore
that
you
wanted
to
bind
up
mine
but
i
did
not
know
oh
believe
me
i
did
not
know
into
whose
house
i
was
coming
i
had
not
heard
your
name
till
one
day
the
young
girl
called
you
osborne
i
had
not
even
thought
of
it
you
were
so
gentle
so
merciful
i
did
not
care
about
your
name
when
one
day
i
heard
a
servant
call
you
de
jarnette
i
fainted
i
was
very
weak
you
know
and
it
came
over
me
like
a
flash
whose
house
i
was
in
i
remember
that
time
said
pennybacker
in
an
undertone
to
de
jarnette
we
wondered
what
it
was
i
felt
after
that
that
i
must
go
away
the
sick
girl
said
i
felt
that
i
could
not
stay
under
your
roof
knowing
that
i
had
made
your
child
fatherless
but
then
i
thought
if
i
should
tell
you
you
would
send
my
louis
back
to
the
home
and
me
to
the
hospital
and
i
would
lose
him
again
just
as
he
was
getting
fond
of
me
i
tried
to
tell
but
i
could
not
can
you
tell
us
now
connectedly
just
what
you
did
and
how
it
was
de
jarnette
that
spoke
his
voice
sounded
stern
in
its
intensity
yes
that
was
what
i
wanted
to
do
that
was
why
i
sent
for
you
both
she
looked
up
helplessly
at
pennybacker
where
must
i
begin
i
have
told
him
rosalie
all
that
we
know
you
need
not
repeat
that
begin
where
you
went
to
de
jarnette
in
his
office
yes
i
will
try
very
hard
to
tell
it
connectedly
but
it
seems
to
come
to
me
in
bits
some
of
it
stands
out
so
much
more
distinctly
than
the
rest
she
lay
still
a
moment
thinking
then
fixing
her
preternaturally
bright
eyes
upon
him
and
speaking
slowly
she
began
i
had
been
sick
for
months
in
the
hospital
but
i
was
better
then
and
soon
would
have
to
go
away
i
did
not
know
where
i
could
go
and
i
worried
a
great
deal
about
it
i
was
sorry
no
not
sorry
either
for
there
was
my
baby
and
what
would
have
become
of
him
if
i
had
died
well
one
day
the
very
day
i
was
to
be
discharged
i
saw
in
a
paper
that
he
this
man
had
come
back
to
washington
after
thinking
it
over
i
determined
that
i
would
go
to
him
and
ask
him
to
settle
on
me
enough
money
to
let
me
take
the
child
and
go
away
somewhere
where
i
need
never
trouble
him
any
more
where
i
could
have
a
little
home
and
keep
my
baby
with
me
you
see
sir
it
was
not
that
i
was
unwilling
to
work
but
with
the
child
i
could
not
get
anything
to
do
richard
de
jarnette
gripped
the
iron
rail
smothering
a
groan
i
went
straight
to
him
from
the
hospital
he
was
sitting
at
his
desk
cleaning
his
revolver
a
pretty
thing
that
seemed
to
catch
my
eye
and
hold
it
while
we
talked
it
was
so
bright
and
shining
i
remember
thinking
that
the
price
of
it
would
pay
for
many
many
loaves
of
bread
i
told
him
what
i
wanted
but
i
think
something
must
have
gone
wrong
before
i
came
for
he
was
very
angry
said
he
had
thought
that
he
was
through
with
me
that
this
was
blackmail
sir
i
swear
to
you
i
did
not
know
what
blackmail
was
i
had
never
heard
the
word
she
waited
a
moment
to
recover
breath
and
then
went
on
oh
i
said
bitter
things
to
him
then
i
seemed
to
see
the
child
before
my
eyes
gasping
as
it
did
in
those
days
when
we
starved
before
the
fever
came
and
it
maddened
me
he
bade
me
leave
it
in
the
home
if
i
could
not
care
for
it
and
go
away
to
some
other
city
i
would
soon
forget
it
if
i
were
away
and
it
would
be
cared
for
by
the
district
i
its
mother
would
forget
he
said
that
he
would
give
me
money
to
go
away
from
washington
a
ticket
to
chicago
or
the
far
west
no
more
he
had
done
all
for
me
that
he
could
far
more
than
many
a
man
would
do
it
would
have
to
end
some
time
and
more
like
this
a
ticket
to
go
away
and
leave
my
child
this
was
his
cure
for
all
my
wrongs
margaret
stooped
over
and
took
the
sick
girl
hand
at
the
sweet
touch
of
sympathy
rosalie
turned
toward
her
the
words
coming
now
fast
and
feverishly
then
then
oh
madam
i
have
been
a
wicked
woman
i
did
not
mean
to
do
it
but
while
he
was
speaking
something
in
my
brain
seemed
to
burst
i
saw
strange
things
all
jumbled
up
together
in
a
flash
the
lilacs
in
our
yard
at
home
a
wretched
woman
of
the
street
with
painted
face
a
baby
left
upon
a
mountain
side
to
perish
as
i
had
read
in
my
history
the
spartans
left
them
and
whirling
everywhere
before
my
eyes
that
cursed
shining
pistol
worth
so
many
loaves
of
bread
she
stopped
overcome
by
the
recital
there
was
not
a
sound
but
the
tick
of
the
clock
on
the
mantel
they
were
all
in
the
fatal
office
said
richard
de
jarnette
with
a
white
set
face
go
on
then
i
ca
seem
to
remember
anything
clearly
then
except
that
i
caught
the
pistol
up
and
fired
i
think
he
must
have
started
up
for
he
fell
against
me
she
closed
her
eyes
and
a
shudder
ran
through
her
oh
h
i
have
seen
his
face
so
often
in
the
night
what
happened
then
go
on
urged
richard
fearing
that
her
strength
might
fail
it
was
but
a
moment
from
the
time
that
shot
was
fired
before
i
was
there
where
did
you
go
the
minute
i
fired
the
thought
came
to
me
of
my
own
danger
i
had
not
seemed
to
think
of
it
before
and
at
that
second
i
heard
somebody
trying
to
get
in
i
thought
they
were
coming
to
get
me
you
know
how
things
will
come
to
you
all
in
a
flash
i
remembered
that
there
was
a
night
latch
on
the
door
that
i
could
get
out
if
they
could
not
get
in
in
a
second
i
had
thrown
the
pistol
on
the
floor
and
was
in
the
hall
with
the
door
closed
behind
me
it
was
that
i
heard
breathed
margaret
i
i
heard
a
door
shut
it
was
just
a
step
around
to
the
side
hall
where
the
elevator
was
as
i
turned
the
corner
i
heard
somebody
running
from
the
room
across
the
hall
then
the
elevator
came
i
stepped
in
and
before
anybody
knew
what
was
the
matter
i
was
in
the
street
no
i
do
know
where
i
went
or
what
i
did
i
think
from
what
they
told
me
afterwards
that
i
went
back
to
the
hospital
and
they
took
me
in
at
any
rate
i
found
myself
there
when
i
knew
anything
again
long
afterwards
they
said
i
had
had
a
relapse
why
have
you
waited
so
long
to
tell
this
demanded
richard
de
jarnette
so
sternly
that
she
cowered
down
in
the
bed
oh
sir
i
was
afraid
to
tell
afraid
her
voice
sank
to
a
frightened
whisper
that
they
would
hang
me
will
they
do
it
now
no
said
pennybacker
constituting
herself
judge
and
jury
no
oh
i
have
been
frightfully
afraid
sometimes
i
have
put
my
fingers
around
my
throat
and
pressed
hard
to
see
rosalie
yes
and
then
i
always
gave
it
up
i
do
it
but
the
girl
went
on
turning
to
margaret
again
it
was
not
that
alone
i
think
i
could
have
got
so
after
a
while
that
i
would
have
dared
to
die
even
that
shameful
death
i
was
so
worn
out
with
it
all
the
struggle
and
the
remorse
but
for
my
child
sake
i
could
not
tell
i
felt
that
you
would
cast
him
off
if
you
knew
all
how
could
you
bear
him
in
your
home
when
when
and
if
you
turned
against
him
who
would
take
him
up
oh
madam
i
tried
to
tell
but
when
i
thought
of
him
i
could
not
to
keep
this
horrible
secret
that
was
eating
my
life
away
seemed
the
only
thing
left
that
i
could
do
for
him
rosalie
why
have
you
told
it
now
because
oh
madam
i
can
not
die
with
a
lie
upon
my
lips
a
lie
that
keeps
child
from
your
arms
my
child
from
my
arms
repeated
margaret
groping
for
her
meaning
why
rosalie
you
have
talked
enough
now
said
pennybacker
kindly
you
are
worn
out
one
moment
margaret
interrupted
then
dropping
to
her
knees
beside
the
sick
girl
she
took
her
hand
saying
solemnly
be
at
peace
i
promise
by
the
love
i
bear
my
own
child
that
i
will
be
a
mother
to
yours
from
this
day
he
shall
bear
his
father
name
oh
madam
de
jarnette
broke
the
silence
that
fell
on
them
then
there
is
no
need
that
this
should
ever
be
known
outside
of
ourselves
to
the
world
victor
de
jarnette
died
by
accident
so
let
it
rest
when
rosalie
spoke
again
it
was
only
to
murmur
as
if
to
herself
i
did
not
know
the
world
had
people
in
it
like
this
to
pennybacker
who
bent
over
her
with
a
reviving
draught
she
said
as
simply
as
a
child
would
say
it
do
you
think
god
will
forgive
me
now
as
a
father
pitieth
his
children
so
the
lord
pitieth
them
that
fear
him
was
the
instant
answer
knoweth
our
frame
he
remembereth
that
we
are
dust
to
margaret
it
was
an
assurance
of
infinite
compassion
but
the
sick
girl
started
up
crying
oh
not
as
a
father
not
that
my
father
shut
his
door
upon
me
my
child
father
cast
him
off
if
it
could
only
have
been
a
mother
rosalie
it
is
for
as
if
that
was
not
enough
the
dear
lord
says
one
whom
his
mother
comforteth
so
will
i
comfort
you
does
it
say
that
is
it
true
one
whom
his
mother
comforteth
oh
my
mother
would
have
comforted
me
she
would
have
taken
me
sinful
though
i
was
to
her
arms
she
would
have
she
closed
her
eyes
and
lay
still
then
they
saw
her
lips
move
one
whom
his
comforteth
pennybacker
motioned
them
silently
to
go
they
reached
the
lower
hall
before
either
spoke
then
margaret
said
not
raising
her
eyes
to
his
richard
if
god
can
so
forgive
may
not
we
he
was
silent
so
long
that
she
looked
up
at
him
in
wonder
his
face
was
gray
she
opened
her
lips
to
ask
him
if
he
were
ill
but
at
that
moment
something
in
his
look
palsied
the
words
her
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
her
breath
was
shut
off
an
instant
horrible
enlightenment
had
fallen
upon
her
then
you
thought
i
did
it
she
said
chapter
xliii
in
the
library
once
more
he
caught
her
hand
as
she
turned
from
him
margaret
for
god
sake
hear
me
before
you
go
opening
the
door
of
the
library
he
drew
her
in
and
closed
it
behind
them
she
dropped
into
a
chair
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
but
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
been
there
together
since
the
reading
of
the
will
and
the
benumbing
influence
of
that
hour
fell
on
him
like
a
nightmare
he
felt
that
he
could
never
make
her
hear
struggle
as
he
might
for
utterance
it
would
only
be
an
inarticulate
horrible
moan
at
last
if
he
could
but
have
heard
this
story
before
if
only
the
fatal
words
and
shall
claim
the
child
had
been
unsaid
how
different
all
would
be
how
frightfully
easy
to
utter
words
how
impossible
to
evade
the
avalanche
of
consequences
they
set
loose
from
his
place
by
the
mantel
with
one
arm
resting
on
it
he
regarded
her
in
silence
neither
evaded
the
other
now
they
knew
by
instinct
that
it
was
the
final
passage
between
them
go
on
she
said
let
me
hear
it
now
repeating
you
thought
i
did
it
not
scornfully
nor
even
in
reproach
but
as
one
who
is
in
a
maze
and
hunting
for
the
clue
i
thought
you
did
it
for
five
long
years
you
have
believed
me
a
murderess
and
have
given
me
no
opportunity
to
vindicate
myself
for
five
long
years
i
have
believed
you
a
murderess
and
have
given
you
no
chance
to
vindicate
yourself
it
seemed
almost
as
if
he
were
mocking
her
but
she
knew
from
the
wretchedness
of
his
face
that
he
was
simply
pleading
guilty
this
then
is
the
explanation
of
it
all
why
you
have
followed
me
so
pitilessly
why
margaret
listen
to
me
he
cried
throwing
off
the
incubus
that
was
upon
him
let
me
add
my
part
to
the
pitiful
story
you
heard
upstairs
before
you
pass
final
judgment
then
i
will
go
away
out
of
your
life
forever
you
can
not
go
away
out
of
my
life
forever
she
said
passionately
remembering
philip
it
is
too
late
for
that
when
one
thrusts
himself
into
the
life
of
another
he
can
not
leave
it
at
his
will
neither
can
he
escape
the
consequences
of
his
acts
by
turning
his
back
upon
them
true
too
true
he
answered
mournfully
there
was
a
note
of
such
utter
misery
in
his
voice
that
it
touched
her
heart
i
hope
you
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
not
one
word
of
that
poor
girl
story
was
ever
known
to
me
before
had
it
been
i
should
not
have
left
it
to
you
to
befriend
her
and
care
for
her
child
i
had
always
known
that
victor
was
wild
and
reckless
but
young
men
seldom
make
confidants
of
their
mentors
i
did
not
pry
into
his
affairs
i
think
perhaps
i
knew
in
a
general
way
that
they
would
not
bear
it
and
i
shrank
from
it
i
do
not
expect
you
to
understand
my
feeling
toward
victor
wayward
as
he
had
always
been
i
yet
loved
him
there
was
good
in
the
boy
i
believe
now
that
had
he
lived
you
might
have
won
him
to
a
better
life
i
had
hoped
until
that
hour
that
it
might
be
but
with
life
snuffed
out
his
day
was
done
and
it
was
your
hand
had
struck
him
down
she
shook
her
head
in
sorrowful
protest
i
know
i
know
but
to
me
in
all
these
years
it
was
your
hand
he
spoke
in
fragments
with
silences
in
between
you
asked
me
that
day
what
he
said
perhaps
if
i
should
tell
you
now
it
would
be
some
extenuation
at
least
she
looked
up
at
him
breathless
what
was
it
as
i
bent
over
him
he
said
killed
me
dick
margaret
sank
back
in
her
chair
and
it
was
rosalie
yes
rosalie
but
as
he
said
it
you
stood
above
him
with
a
smoking
revolver
in
your
hand
a
revolver
i
had
seen
here
on
your
table
but
a
few
months
before
she
opened
a
drawer
and
took
it
out
it
has
been
here
ever
since
he
had
a
pair
of
them
he
took
the
revolver
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
it
it
was
of
peculiar
workmanship
the
counterpart
of
one
now
in
his
own
possession
the
one
he
took
out
every
now
and
then
and
looked
at
he
drew
a
quick
sharp
breath
that
was
almost
a
groan
then
laid
it
down
saying
quietly
i
did
not
know
that
it
might
have
changed
everything
if
i
had
known
you
see
how
strong
it
made
the
case
against
you
and
then
his
saying
did
he
say
anything
else
she
questioned
eagerly
yes
he
said
prosecute
i
deserved
it
and
it
was
rosalie
she
repeated
it
was
rosalie
he
tried
to
save
oh
i
am
glad
he
said
that
glad
why
did
you
tell
her
there
will
be
time
for
that
he
marveled
that
she
could
think
now
of
rosalie
do
you
not
see
how
all
this
misled
me
i
see
you
thought
it
was
his
treatment
of
me
he
meant
yes
and
then
you
told
me
once
that
if
he
ever
tried
to
take
the
child
that
i
should
kill
him
i
remember
it
it
was
in
the
days
when
i
was
full
of
words
and
you
believed
i
did
it
as
god
hears
me
i
did
margaret
you
can
never
know
what
that
struggle
was
it
racked
me
his
blood
cried
to
me
day
and
night
as
i
watched
it
ebb
away
and
as
i
stood
beside
him
in
the
silent
house
that
i
thought
had
desolated
i
prayed
that
vengeance
might
fall
on
you
for
this
thing
as
for
me
i
was
bound
bound
by
his
dying
wish
and
his
dying
declaration
who
would
believe
me
if
i
charged
you
with
the
crime
and
even
if
proof
were
not
lacking
how
could
i
bring
you
to
justice
when
with
his
latest
breath
he
begged
that
i
would
spare
you
at
last
i
remembered
the
words
is
mine
i
will
repay
saith
the
lord
i
believe
in
that
god
vengeance
does
not
always
come
swiftly
but
it
comes
i
believed
that
some
day
it
would
fall
on
you
and
i
could
wait
she
stared
at
him
with
fascinated
eyes
half
feeling
in
the
tension
of
the
moment
that
she
was
the
guilty
thing
he
thought
her
the
waiting
was
not
long
when
the
will
was
read
the
will
that
by
the
accursed
law
of
this
district
had
power
to
take
your
child
from
you
and
give
him
to
me
i
saw
in
it
my
opportunity
they
say
there
is
the
beast
in
every
man
the
old
primordial
instinct
to
rend
and
kill
which
ages
of
training
and
leash
and
club
have
not
exterminated
i
do
not
know
sometimes
i
think
it
may
be
true
what
i
do
know
is
that
i
came
into
this
room
a
man
with
a
man
but
when
i
found
my
hand
upon
your
throat
found
that
time
had
come
something
within
me
that
i
did
not
know
was
there
leaped
up
and
fought
and
roared
i
could
not
hold
it
down
it
mastered
me
and
at
the
last
it
took
my
form
and
said
through
my
lips
shall
be
will
repay
and
i
will
repay
through
she
shrank
from
him
as
we
do
in
the
presence
of
the
mighty
elemental
forces
of
nature
it
seemed
to
me
in
my
distorted
state
of
mind
that
this
was
justice
and
that
i
was
the
instrument
to
mete
it
out
but
margaret
he
stretched
out
his
hands
toward
her
and
then
let
them
drop
it
was
not
true
in
my
arrogance
i
had
usurped
the
prerogative
of
almighty
god
and
he
has
punished
me
his
voice
sank
lower
and
lower
with
each
word
at
last
she
broke
the
silence
that
was
stifling
her
saying
wonderingly
and
with
hesitation
how
how
has
he
punished
you
i
think
i
do
not
understand
through
philip
do
you
mean
no
not
through
philip
not
through
philip
through
philip
mother
the
room
lapsed
into
silence
then
her
heart
was
beating
so
that
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
must
hear
the
throbs
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
his
meaning
i
count
it
part
of
my
humiliation
he
said
in
proud
and
i
will
not
spare
myself
that
i
must
come
at
the
last
to
the
woman
i
have
persecuted
the
woman
i
have
hunted
down
and
robbed
the
woman
i
have
in
my
heart
held
guilty
of
foul
crime
and
tell
her
that
love
she
did
not
stir
nor
look
at
him
then
his
mood
changed
and
from
his
stand
by
the
mantel
he
regarded
her
with
a
sort
of
grim
humor
this
surely
is
the
irony
of
fate
he
went
on
speaking
almost
as
if
in
soliloquy
that
i
should
come
to
with
tale
of
love
margaret
why
do
you
taunt
me
with
my
weakness
jeer
at
me
say
the
biting
scathing
things
you
must
want
to
say
this
certainly
is
your
opportunity
it
would
complete
your
victory
there
is
no
victory
she
said
in
a
dead
tone
it
is
all
defeat
he
was
filled
with
contrition
forgive
me
i
seem
to
have
an
infinite
capacity
for
being
cruel
and
yet
how
can
i
make
you
understand
that
i
would
give
all
i
hold
dear
if
i
could
have
the
right
to
shield
you
how
can
i
expect
you
to
believe
why
margaret
even
the
boy
the
boy
has
crept
into
my
heart
and
intrenched
himself
until
i
can
not
put
him
out
a
faint
pink
stole
over
her
eyelids
and
her
chin
moved
just
once
but
she
did
not
look
up
and
you
child
it
overmasters
me
every
fiber
of
my
being
cries
out
for
you
it
is
so
different
from
a
boy
paltry
passion
he
took
a
step
toward
her
as
though
driven
by
a
force
beyond
control
and
said
in
passionate
pleading
dearest
let
me
call
you
that
just
once
did
you
think
you
could
come
into
my
starved
life
in
the
close
intimate
even
though
enforced
comradeship
of
the
and
leave
that
life
just
as
you
found
it
could
show
me
the
love
and
sympathy
the
infinite
patience
and
tenderness
of
the
mother
a
thing
i
had
never
known
and
the
dignity
the
sweetness
the
charm
of
the
woman
did
you
think
that
you
could
thus
reveal
yourself
to
me
and
then
go
away
and
leave
me
the
same
man
i
had
been
you
never
thought
of
it
at
all
did
you
you
were
thinking
of
philip
always
philip
but
margaret
was
human
i
thought
of
you
and
while
you
rocked
the
child
and
sang
soft
cradle
songs
to
him
i
listened
and
dreamed
dreams
let
me
tell
them
to
you
just
once
for
their
very
wildness
i
dreamed
that
this
was
home
such
a
home
as
i
had
known
in
my
warped
life
only
in
dreams
and
that
we
had
made
it
you
and
i
that
the
song
on
your
lips
was
a
song
of
joy
and
that
i
had
taught
it
to
you
that
the
light
in
your
eyes
was
the
not
for
philip
but
for
me
that
it
was
child
upon
your
breast
that
no
do
not
trouble
to
remind
me
that
even
in
my
dreams
i
was
a
fool
but
my
god
if
only
i
could
have
had
the
chance
another
man
might
have
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
had
a
different
quality
a
yearning
compassion
that
had
in
it
something
of
the
maternal
but
margaret
that
was
before
i
knew
of
philip
new
danger
since
that
last
crushing
blow
has
fallen
upon
you
the
feeling
is
so
much
more
infinitely
tender
i
think
a
hundred
times
a
day
i
could
take
her
and
her
helpless
child
to
my
heart
and
hold
them
there
forever
if
i
could
bear
for
her
the
load
that
i
have
forced
upon
her
or
help
her
bear
it
if
i
could
go
with
her
upon
this
pitiful
quest
could
stand
beside
her
and
let
her
lean
upon
my
strength
could
comfort
her
she
put
her
elbow
on
the
table
and
rested
her
head
on
her
hand
two
big
tears
rose
and
struggled
under
her
closed
lids
she
needed
comforting
and
if
the
worst
comes
as
it
may
could
have
her
lay
her
head
upon
my
breast
and
weep
her
grief
out
there
the
drops
pushed
through
what
woman
oh
what
woman
in
her
time
of
sorrow
has
not
felt
need
of
such
a
refuge
margaret
if
i
could
thus
atone
i
feel
that
i
should
ask
no
more
of
earth
but
that
i
have
with
my
own
hand
barred
myself
forever
from
your
life
is
my
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
in
his
even
controlled
voice
taking
up
the
subject
they
had
talked
of
earlier
under
the
wistaria
and
telling
her
of
the
arrangements
he
had
made
the
doctor
had
suggested
the
sea
voyage
for
philip
and
had
also
urged
his
being
put
under
the
care
of
a
specialist
at
once
he
had
taken
the
liberty
of
engaging
passage
for
them
on
the
the
steamer
on
which
the
doctor
sailed
but
this
was
conditional
of
course
he
waited
a
moment
but
she
did
not
speak
and
he
went
on
rather
hurriedly
to
explain
that
he
had
done
this
because
he
knew
the
staterooms
might
all
be
taken
if
he
waited
to
communicate
with
her
it
was
only
by
their
having
been
surrendered
that
he
had
been
able
to
get
these
he
hoped
he
had
not
offended
her
by
his
action
in
the
matter
they
could

she
shook
her
head
not
taking
down
her
sheltering
hand
she
had
heard
this
last
as
one
hears
in
a
dream
thinking
dully
that
this
was
the
end
during
her
contest
with
him
she
had
been
nerved
to
fight
now
that
it
was
over
she
felt
strengthless
nerves
in
collapse
when
he
had
spoken
of
her
pitiful
quest
she
seemed
to
see
a
dreary
stretch
of
road
before
her
that
had
no
end
she
and
philip
were
on
it
toiling
along
going
she
knew
not
where
stumbling
falling
sometimes
but
getting
up
and
struggling
on
and
richard
behind
them
stretching
out
his
hands
if
if
oh
that
would
be
a
shameful
thing
the
man
that
had
stolen
her
child
a
monstrous
thing
then
something
rose
up
within
her
and
contended
fiercely
but
it
is
life
what
give
up
now
make
complete
surrender
and
in
such
a
way
oh
no
she
would
be
stronger
when
he
was
gone
the
shock
of
it
had
unnerved
her
that
was
all
she
got
up
then
and
stood
before
him
her
head
thrown
back
in
its
old
way
meaning
to
thank
him
courteously
and
in
conventional
phrase
for
what
he
had
done
speaking
in
the
effusive
fashion
which
says
so
much
and
means
so
little
you
are
very
kind
we
will
take
the
staterooms
and
go
at
once
thank
you
so
much
for
your
thoughtfulness
thus
would
she
build
up
the
wall
that
must
always
be
between
them
but
when
she
stood
before
him
and
looked
into
his
stern
set
face
remembering
all
he
had
said
to
her
somehow
the
road
stretched
out
interminably
before
her
and
what
she
did
was
to
reach
out
weak
hands
to
him
saying
brokenly
richard

smothering

sob
summoned

and
he
more
than

else
had
made
it
so
she
should
always
feel
grateful
to
him
and
love
him
for
that
as
a
friend
of
course
she
was
nothing
to
him
but
a

and
the
tightness
grew
to

she
was
putting
into

a
book
of

he
had
brought
her
to

him
by
