the
lone
star
ranger
by
zane
grey
to
captain
john
hughes
and
his
texas
rangers
it
may
seem
strange
to
you
that
out
of
all
the
stories
i
heard
on
the
rio
grande
i
should
choose
as
first
that
of
buck
duane
outlaw
and
gunman
but
indeed
ranger
coffee
story
of
the
last
of
the
duanes
has
haunted
me
and
i
have
given
full
rein
to
imagination
and
have
retold
it
in
my
own
way
it
deals
with
the
old
law
the
old
border
days
therefore
it
is
better
first
soon
perchance
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
writing
of
the
border
of
which
in
joe
sitter
laconic
speech
is
as
bad
an
wild
as
ever
in
the
north
and
east
there
is
a
popular
idea
that
the
frontier
of
the
west
is
a
thing
long
past
and
remembered
now
only
in
stories
as
i
think
of
this
i
remember
ranger
sitter
when
he
made
that
remark
while
he
grimly
stroked
an
unhealed
bullet
wound
and
i
remember
the
giant
vaughn
that
typical
son
of
stalwart
texas
sitting
there
quietly
with
bandaged
head
his
thoughtful
eye
boding
ill
to
the
outlaw
who
had
ambushed
him
only
a
few
months
have
passed
since
then
when
i
had
my
memorable
sojourn
with
you
and
yet
in
that
short
time
russell
and
moore
have
crossed
the
divide
like
rangers
gentlemen
i
have
the
honor
to
dedicate
this
book
to
you
and
the
hope
that
it
shall
fall
to
my
lot
to
tell
the
world
the
truth
about
a
strange
unique
and
misunderstood
body
of
men
the
texas
rangers
who
made
the
great
lone
star
state
habitable
who
never
know
peaceful
rest
and
sleep
who
are
passing
who
surely
will
not
be
forgotten
and
will
some
day
come
into
their
own
zane
grey
book
i
the
outlaw
chapter
i
so
it
was
in
him
then
an
inherited
fighting
instinct
a
driving
intensity
to
kill
he
was
the
last
of
the
duanes
that
old
fighting
stock
of
texas
but
not
the
memory
of
his
dead
father
nor
the
pleading
of
his
mother
nor
the
warning
of
this
uncle
who
stood
before
him
now
had
brought
to
buck
duane
so
much
realization
of
the
dark
passionate
strain
in
his
blood
it
was
the
recurrence
a
increased
in
power
of
a
strange
emotion
that
for
the
last
three
years
had
arisen
in
him
cal
bain
in
town
full
of
bad
whisky
an
huntin
for
you
repeated
the
elder
man
gravely
the
second
time
muttered
duane
as

to
himself

in
texas
these
days
my
boy

to
kill
here
it
stirred
in
duane
again
that
bursting
gush
of
blood
like
a
wind
of
flame
shaking
all
his
inner
being
and
subsiding
to
leave
him
strangely
chilled
me
what
for
he
asked
knows
there
ai
any
reason
but
what
that
to
do
with
most
of
the
shootin
these
days
did
five
cowboys
over
to
everall
kill
one
another
dead
all
because
they
got
to
jerkin
at
a
quirt
among
themselves

one
of

bad
there
a
lot
of
wild
cowboys
who
ambitious
for
a
reputation
they
talk
about
how
quick
they
are
on
the
draw
they
ape
bland
an
king

an
hardin
an
all
the
big
outlaws
they
make
threats
about
joinin
the
gangs
along
the
rio
grande
they
laugh
at
the
sheriffs
an
brag
about
how

the
rangers
cal
sure
not
much
for
you
to
bother
with
if
you
only
keep
out
of
his
mean
for
me
to

asked
duane
in
scorn

i
would
put
it
that

get
you
if
you
met
down
there
in

an
his
slick
hand
with
a
gun
what
i
most
afraid
of
is
that
you
kill
duane
was
silent
letting
his
uncle
earnest
words
sink
in
trying
to
realize
their
significance
texas
ever
recovers
from
that
fool
war
an
kills
off
these
outlaws
why
a
young
man
will
have
a
lookout
went
on
the
uncle
now
an
a
powerful
sight
of
a
fine
fellow
barrin
your
temper
you
a
chance
in
life
but
if
you
go
if
you
kill
a
man
you
ruined
then
you
kill
another
it
be
the
same
old
story
an
the
rangers
would
make
you
an
outlaw
the
rangers
mean
law
an
order
for
texas
this
business
does
work
with
them
if
you
resist
arrest
they
kill
you
if
you
submit
to
arrest
then
you
go
to
jail
an
mebbe
you
never
hang
muttered
duane
darkly
reckon
you
would
replied
the
old
man
be
like
your
father
he
was
ever
ready
to
draw
too
ready
in
times
like
these
with
the
texas
rangers
enforcin
the
law
your
dad
would
have
been
driven
to
the
river
an
son
i
afraid
you
a
chip
off
the
old
block
you
hold
in
keep
your
temper
run
away
from
trouble
because
it
only
result
in
you
gettin
the
worst
of
it
in
the
end
your
father
was
killed
in
a
an
it
was
told
of
him
that
he
shot
twice
after
a
bullet
had
passed
through
his
heart
think
of
the
terrible
nature
of
a
man
to
be
able
to
do
that
if
you
have
any
such
blood
in
you
never
give
it
a
you
say
is
all
very
well
uncle
returned
duane
the
only
way
out
for
me
is
to
run
and
i
wo
do
it
cal
bain
and
his
outfit
have
already
made
me
look
like
a
coward
he
says
i
afraid
to
come
out
and
face
him
a
man
simply
ca
stand
that
in
this
country
besides
cal
would
shoot
me
in
the
back
some
day
if
i
did
face
then
what
you
goin
to
do
inquired
the
elder
man
have
decided
but
you
comin
to
it
mighty
fast
that
damned
spell
is
in
you
you
different
i
remember
how
you
used
to
be
moody
lose
your
temper
an
talk
wild
never
was
much
afraid
of
you
then
but
now
you
gettin
cool
an
quiet
an
you
think
deep
an
i
do
like
the
light
in
your
eye
it
reminds
me
of
your
wonder
what
dad
would
say
to
me
if
he
were
alive
and
here
said
duane
do
you
think
what
could
you
expect
of
a
man
who
never
wore
a
glove
on
his
right
hand
for
twenty
years
he
hardly
have
said
much
dad
never
talked
but
he
would
have
done
a
lot
and
i
guess
i
go
and
let
cal
bain
find
then
followed
a
long
silence
during
which
duane
sat
with
downcast
eyes
and
the
uncle
appeared
lost
in
sad
thought
of
the
future
presently
he
turned
to
duane
with
an
expression
that
denoted
resignation
and
yet
a
spirit
which
showed
wherein
they
were
of
the
same
blood
got
a
fast
horse
the
fastest
i
know
of
in
this
country
after
you
meet
bain
hurry
back
home
i
have
a
packed
for
you
and
the
horse
with
that
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
into
the
house
leaving
duane
to
revolve
in
his
mind
his
singular
speech
buck
wondered
presently
if
he
shared
his
uncle
opinion
of
the
result
of
a
meeting
between
himself
and
bain
his
thoughts
were
vague
but
on
the
instant
of
final
decision
when
he
had
settled
with
himself
that
he
would
meet
bain
such
a
storm
of
passion
assailed
him
that
he
felt
as
if
he
was
being
shaken
with
ague
yet
it
was
all
internal
inside
his
breast
for
his
hand
was
like
a
rock
and
for
all
he
could
see
not
a
muscle
about
him
quivered
he
had
no
fear
of
bain
or
of
any
other
man
but
a
vague
fear
of
himself
of
this
strange
force
in
him
made
him
ponder
and
shake
his
head
it
was
as
if
he
had
not
all
to
say
in
this
matter
there
appeared
to
have
been
in
him
a
reluctance
to
let
himself
go
and
some
voice
some
spirit
from
a
distance
something
he
was
not
accountable
for
had
compelled
him
that
hour
of
duane
life
was
like
years
of
actual
living
and
in
it
he
became
a
thoughtful
man
he
went
into
the
house
and
buckled
on
his
belt
and
gun
the
gun
was
a
and
heavy
with
an
ivory
handle
he
had
packed
it
on
and
off
for
five
years
before
that
it
had
been
used
by
his
father
there
were
a
number
of
notches
filed
in
the
bulge
of
the
ivory
handle
this
gun
was
the
one
his
father
had
fired
twice
after
being
shot
through
the
heart
and
his
hand
had
stiffened
so
tightly
upon
it
in
the
that
his
fingers
had
to
be
pried
open
it
had
never
been
drawn
upon
any
man
since
it
had
come
into
duane
possession
but
the
cold
bright
polish
of
the
weapon
showed
how
it
had
been
used
duane
could
draw
it
with
inconceivable
rapidity
and
at
twenty
feet
he
could
split
a
card
pointing
edgewise
toward
him
duane
wished
to
avoid
meeting
his
mother
fortunately
as
he
thought
she
was
away
from
home
he
went
out
and
down
the
path
toward
the
gate
the
air
was
full
of
the
fragrance
of
blossoms
and
the
melody
of
birds
outside
in
the
road
a
neighbor
woman
stood
talking
to
a
countryman
in
a
wagon
they
spoke
to
him
and
he
heard
but
did
not
reply
then
he
began
to
stride
down
the
road
toward
the
town
wellston
was
a
small
town
but
important
in
that
unsettled
part
of
the
great
state
because
it
was
the
of
several
hundred
miles
of
territory
on
the
main
street
there
were
perhaps
fifty
buildings
some
brick
some
frame
mostly
adobe
and
of
the
lot
and
by
far
the
most
prosperous
were
saloons
from
the
road
duane
turned
into
this
street
it
was
a
wide
thoroughfare
lined
by
and
saddled
horses
and
vehicles
of
various
kinds
duane
eye
ranged
down
the
street
taking
in
all
at
a
glance
particularly
persons
moving
leisurely
up
and
down
not
a
cowboy
was
in
sight
duane
slackened
his
stride
and
by
the
time
he
reached
sol
white
place
which
was
the
first
saloon
he
was
walking
slowly
several
people
spoke
to
him
and
turned
to
look
back
after
they
had
passed
he
paused
at
the
door
of
white
saloon
took
a
sharp
survey
of
the
interior
then
stepped
inside
the
saloon
was
large
and
cool
full
of
men
and
noise
and
smoke
the
noise
ceased
upon
his
entrance
and
the
silence
ensuing
presently
broke
to
the
clink
of
mexican
silver
dollars
at
a
monte
table
sol
white
who
was
behind
the
bar
straightened
up
when
he
saw
duane
then
without
speaking
he
bent
over
to
rinse
a
glass
all
eyes
except
those
of
the
mexican
gamblers
were
turned
upon
duane
and
these
glances
were
keen
speculative
questioning
these
men
knew
bain
was
looking
for
trouble
they
probably
had
heard
his
boasts
but
what
did
duane
intend
to
do
several
of
the
cowboys
and
ranchers
present
exchanged
glances
duane
had
been
weighed
by
unerring
texas
instinct
by
men
who
all
packed
guns
the
boy
was
the
son
of
his
father
whereupon
they
greeted
him
and
returned
to
their
drinks
and
cards
sol
white
stood
with
his
big
red
hands
out
upon
the
bar
he
was
a
tall
texan
with
a
long
mustache
waxed
to
sharp
points
buck
was
his
greeting
to
duane
he
spoke
carelessly
and
averted
his
dark
gaze
for
an
instant
sol
replied
duane
slowly
sol
i
hear
there
a
gent
in
town
looking
for
me
there
is
buck
replied
white
came
in
heah
aboot
an
hour
ago
shore
he
was
some
riled
an
for
gore
told
me
confidential
a
certain
party
had
given
you
a
white
silk
scarf
an
he
was
on
wearin
it
home
spotted
with
him
queried
duane
an
sam
outcalt
an
a
little
cowpuncher
i
never
seen
before

coaxin
trim
to
leave
town
but
he
looked
on
the
glass
buck
an
he
heah
for
does
sheriff
oaks
lock
him
up
if
he
that
bad
went
away
with
the
rangers
there
been
another
raid
at
ranch
the
king
fisher
gang
likely
an
so
the
town
shore
wide
duane
stalked
outdoors
and
faced
down
the
street
he
walked
the
whole
length
of
the
long
block
meeting
many
people
farmers
ranchers
clerks
merchants
mexicans
cowboys
and
women
it
was
a
singular
fact
that
when
he
turned
to
retrace
his
steps
the
street
was
almost
empty
he
had
not
returned
a
hundred
yards
on
his
way
when
the
street
was
wholly
deserted
a
few
heads
protruded
from
doors
and
around
corners
that
main
street
of
wellston
saw
some
such
situation
every
few
days
if
it
was
an
instinct
for
texans
to
fight
it
was
also
instinctive
for
them
to
sense
with
remarkable
quickness
the
signs
of
a
coming
rumor
could
not
fly
so
swiftly
in
less
than
ten
minutes
everybody
who
had
been
on
the
street
or
in
the
shops
knew
that
buck
duane
had
come
forth
to
meet
his
enemy
duane
walked
on
when
he
came
to
within
fifty
paces
of
a
saloon
he
swerved
out
into
the
middle
of
the
street
stood
there
for
a
moment
then
went
ahead
and
back
to
the
sidewalk
he
passed
on
in
this
way
the
length
of
the
block
sol
white
was
standing
in
the
door
of
his
saloon
i
you
off
he
said
quick
and
bain
over
at
everall
if
he
you
bad
as
he
brags
show
duane
crossed
the
street
and
started
down
notwithstanding
statement
duane
was
wary
and
slow
at
every
door
nothing
happened
and
he
traversed
almost
the
whole
length
of
the
block
without
seeing
a
person
everall
place
was
on
the
corner
duane
knew
himself
to
be
cold
steady
he
was
conscious
of
a
strange
fury
that
made
him
want
to
leap
ahead
he
seemed
to
long
for
this
encounter
more
than
anything
he
had
ever
wanted
but
vivid
as
were
his
sensations
he
felt
as
if
in
a
dream
before
he
reached
everall
he
heard
loud
voices
one
of
which
was
raised
high
then
the
short
door
swung
outward
as
if
impelled
by
a
vigorous
hand
a
cowboy
wearing
wooley
chaps
burst
out
upon
the
sidewalk
at
sight
of
duane
he
seemed
to
bound
into
the
air
and
he
uttered
a
savage
roar
duane
stopped
in
his
tracks
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
sidewalk
perhaps
a
dozen
rods
from
everall
door
if
bain
was
drunk
he
did
not
show
it
in
his
movement
he
swaggered
forward
rapidly
closing
up
the
gap
red
sweaty
disheveled
and
hatless
his
face
distorted
and
expressive
of
the
most
malignant
intent
he
was
a
wild
and
sinister
figure
he
had
already
killed
a
man
and
this
showed
in
his
demeanor
his
hands
were
extended
before
him
the
right
hand
a
little
lower
than
the
left
at
every
step
he
bellowed
his
rancor
in
speech
mostly
curses
gradually
he
slowed
his
walk
then
halted
a
good
paces
separated
the
men
nothin
make
you
draw
you
he
shouted
fiercely
waitin
on
you
cal
replied
duane
bain
right
hand
stiffened
moved
duane
threw
his
gun
as
a
boy
throws
a
ball
underhand
a
draw
his
father
had
taught
him
he
pulled
twice
his
shots
almost
as
one
bain
big
colt
boomed
while
it
was
pointed
downward
and
he
was
falling
his
bullet
scattered
dust
and
gravel
at
duane
feet
he
fell
loosely
without
contortion
in
a
flash
all
was
reality
for
duane
he
went
forward
and
held
his
gun
ready
for
the
slightest
movement
on
the
part
of
bain
but
bain
lay
upon
his
back
and
all
that
moved
were
his
breast
and
his
eyes
how
strangely
the
red
had
left
his
face
and
also
the
distortion
the
devil
that
had
showed
in
bain
was
gone
he
was
sober
and
conscious
he
tried
to
speak
but
failed
his
eyes
expressed
something
pitifully
human
they
changed
rolled
set
blankly
duane
drew
a
deep
breath
and
sheathed
his
gun
he
felt
calm
and
cool
glad
the
fray
was
over
one
violent
expression
burst
from
him
fool
when
he
looked
up
there
were
men
around
him
center
said
one
another
a
cowboy
who
evidently
had
just
left
the
leaned
down
and
pulled
open
bain
shirt
he
had
the
ace
of
spades
in
his
hand
he
laid
it
on
bain
breast
and
the
black
figure
on
the
card
covered
the
two
just
over
bain
heart
duane
wheeled
and
hurried
away
he
heard
another
man
say
cal
got
what
he
deserved
buck
duane
first
gunplay
like
father
like
son
chapter
ii
a
thought
kept
repeating
itself
to
duane
and
it
was
that
he
might
have
spared
himself
concern
through
his
imagining
how
awful
it
would
be
to
kill
a
man
he
had
no
such
feeling
now
he
had
rid
the
community
of
a
drunken
bragging
quarrelsome
cowboy
when
he
came
to
the
gate
of
his
home
and
saw
his
uncle
there
with
a
mettlesome
horse
saddled
with
canteen
rope
and
bags
all
in
place
a
subtle
shock
pervaded
his
spirit
it
had
slipped
his
mind
the
consequence
of
his
act
but
sight
of
the
horse
and
the
look
of
his
uncle
recalled
the
fact
that
he
must
now
become
a
fugitive
an
unreasonable
anger
took
hold
of
him
d
d
fool
he
exclaimed
hotly
bain

much

dusted
my
boots
that
all
and
for
that
i

if
that
time
ever
comes
i
get
word
into
the
unsettled
country
it
reach
you
some
day
that
all
remember
be
a
man
duane
with
blurred
sight
and
contracting
throat
gripped
his
hand
and
bade
him
a
wordless
farewell
then
he
leaped
astride
the
black
and
rode
out
of
town
as
swiftly
as
was
consistent
with
a
care
for
his
steed
duane
put
a
distance
of
fifteen
or
eighteen
miles
behind
him
with
that
he
slowed
up
and
the
matter
of
riding
did
not
require
all
his
faculties
he
passed
several
ranches
and
was
seen
by
men
this
did
not
suit
him
and
he
took
an
old
trail
across
country
it
was
a
flat
region
with
a
poor
growth
of
mesquite
and
cactus
occasionally
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
low
hills
in
the
distance
he
had
hunted
often
in
that
section
and
knew
where
to
find
grass
and
water
when
he
reached
this
higher
ground
he
did
not
however
halt
at
the
first
favorable
but
went
on
and
on
once
he
came
out
upon
the
brow
of
a
hill
and
saw
a
considerable
stretch
of
country
beneath
him
it
had
the
gray
sameness
characterizing
all
that
he
had
traversed
he
seemed
to
want
to
see
wide
spaces
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
great
wilderness
lying
somewhere
beyond
to
the
southwest
it
was
sunset
when
he
decided
to
camp
at
a
likely
spot
he
came
across
he
led
the
horse
to
water
and
then
began
searching
through
the
shallow
valley
for
a
suitable
place
to
camp
he
passed
by
old
that
he
well
remembered
these
however
did
not
strike
his
fancy
this
time
and
the
significance
of
the
change
in
him
did
not
occur
at
the
moment
at
last
he
found
a
secluded
spot
under
cover
of
thick
mesquites
and
oaks
at
a
goodly
distance
from
the
old
trail
he
took
saddle
and
pack
off
the
horse
he
looked
among
his
effects
for
a
hobble
and
finding
that
his
uncle
had
failed
to
put
one
in
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
seldom
used
a
hobble
and
never
on
this
horse
he
cut
a
few
feet
off
the
end
of
his
lasso
and
used
that
the
horse
unused
to
such
hampering
of
his
free
movements
had
to
be
driven
out
upon
the
grass
duane
made
a
small
fire
prepared
and
ate
his
supper
this
done
ending
the
work
of
that
day
he
sat
down
and
filled
his
pipe
twilight
had
waned
into
dusk
a
few
wan
stars
had
just
begun
to
show
and
brighten
above
the
low
continuous
hum
of
insects
sounded
the
evening
carol
of
robins
presently
the
birds
ceased
their
singing
and
then
the
quiet
was
more
noticeable
when
night
set
in
and
the
place
seemed
all
the
more
isolated
and
lonely
for
that
duane
had
a
sense
of
relief
it
dawned
upon
him
all
at
once
that
he
was
nervous
watchful
sleepless
the
fact
caused
him
surprise
and
he
began
to
think
back
to
take
note
of
his
late
actions
and
their
motives
the
change
one
day
had
wrought
amazed
him
he
who
had
always
been
free
easy
happy
especially
when
out
alone
in
the
open
had
become
in
a
few
short
hours
bound
serious
preoccupied
the
silence
that
had
once
been
sweet
now
meant
nothing
to
him
except
a
medium
whereby
he
might
the
better
hear
the
sounds
of
pursuit
the
loneliness
the
night
the
wild
that
had
always
been
beautiful
to
him
now
only
conveyed
a
sense
of
safety
for
the
present
he
watched
he
listened
he
thought
he
felt
tired
yet
had
no
inclination
to
rest
he
intended
to
be
off
by
dawn
heading
toward
the
southwest
had
he
a
destination
it
was
vague
as
his
knowledge
of
that
great
waste
of
mesquite
and
rock
bordering
the
rio
grande
somewhere
out
there
was
a
refuge
for
he
was
a
fugitive
from
justice
an
outlaw
this
being
an
outlaw
then
meant
eternal
vigilance
no
home
no
rest
no
sleep
no
content
no
life
worth
the
living
he
must
be
a
lone
wolf
or
he
must
herd
among
men
obnoxious
to
him
if
he
worked
for
an
honest
living
he
still
must
hide
his
identity
and
take
risks
of
detection
if
he
did
not
work
on
some
distant
outlying
ranch
how
was
he
to
live
the
idea
of
stealing
was
repugnant
to
him
the
future
seemed
gray
and
somber
enough
and
he
was
years
old
why
had
this
hard
life
been
imposed
upon
him
the
bitter
question
seemed
to
start
a
strange
iciness
that
stole
along
his
veins
what
was
wrong
with
him
he
stirred
the
few
sticks
of
mesquite
into
a
last
flickering
blaze
he
was
cold
and
for
some
reason
he
wanted
some
light
the
black
circle
of
darkness
weighed
down
upon
him
closed
in
around
him
suddenly
he
sat
bolt
upright
and
then
froze
in
that
position
he
had
heard
a
step
it
was
behind
him
no
on
the
side
some
one
was
there
he
forced
his
hand
down
to
his
gun
and
the
touch
of
cold
steel
was
another
icy
shock
then
he
waited
but
all
was
silent
silent
as
only
a
wilderness
arroyo
can
be
with
its
low
murmuring
of
wind
in
the
mesquite
had
he
heard
a
step
he
began
to
breathe
again
but
what
was
the
matter
with
the
light
of
his
it
had
taken
on
a
strange
green
luster
and
seemed
to
be
waving
off
into
the
outer
shadows
duane
heard
no
step
saw
no
movement
nevertheless
there
was
another
present
at
that
vigil
duane
saw
him
he
lay
there
in
the
middle
of
the
green
brightness
prostrate
motionless
dying
cal
bain
his
features
were
wonderfully
distinct
clearer
than
any
cameo
more
sharply
outlined
than
those
of
any
picture
it
was
a
hard
face
softening
at
the
threshold
of
eternity
the
red
tan
of
sun
the
coarse
signs
of
drunkenness
the
ferocity
and
hate
so
characteristic
of
bain
were
no
longer
there
this
face
represented
a
different
bain
showed
all
that
was
human
in
him
fading
fading
as
swiftly
as
it
blanched
white
the
lips
wanted
to
speak
but
had
not
the
power
the
eyes
held
an
agony
of
thought
they
revealed
what
might
have
been
possible
for
this
man
if
he
lived
that
he
saw
his
mistake
too
late
then
they
rolled
set
blankly
and
closed
in
death
that
haunting
visitation
left
duane
sitting
there
in
a
cold
sweat
a
remorse
gnawing
at
his
vitals
realizing
the
curse
that
was
on
him
he
divined
that
never
would
he
be
able
to
keep
off
that
phantom
he
remembered
how
his
father
had
been
eternally
pursued
by
the
furies
of
accusing
guilt
how
he
had
never
been
able
to
forget
in
work
or
in
sleep
those
men
he
had
killed
the
hour
was
late
when
duane
mind
let
him
sleep
and
then
dreams
troubled
him
in
the
morning
he
bestirred
himself
so
early
that
in
the
gray
gloom
he
had
difficulty
in
finding
his
horse
day
had
just
broken
when
he
struck
the
old
trail
again
he
rode
hard
all
morning
and
halted
in
a
shady
spot
to
rest
and
graze
his
horse
in
the
afternoon
he
took
to
the
trail
at
an
easy
trot
the
country
grew
wilder
bald
rugged
mountains
broke
the
level
of
the
monotonous
horizon
about
three
in
the
afternoon
he
came
to
a
little
river
which
marked
the
boundary
line
of
his
hunting
territory
the
decision
he
made
to
travel
for
a
while
was
owing
to
two
facts
the
river
was
high
with
quicksand
bars
on
each
side
and
he
felt
reluctant
to
cross
into
that
region
where
his
presence
alone
meant
that
he
was
a
marked
man
the
through
which
the
river
wound
to
the
southwest
were
more
inviting
than
the
barrens
he
had
traversed
the
rest
or
that
day
he
rode
leisurely
at
sunset
he
penetrated
the
brakes
of
willow
and
cottonwood
to
spend
the
night
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
this
lonely
cover
he
would
feel
easy
and
content
but
he
did
not
every
feeling
every
imagining
he
had
experienced
the
previous
night
returned
somewhat
more
vividly
and
accentuated
by
newer
ones
of
the
same
intensity
and
color
in
this
kind
of
travel
and
camping
he
spent
three
more
days
during
which
he
crossed
a
number
of
trails
and
one
road
where
cattle
stolen
cattle
probably
had
recently
passed
thus
time
exhausted
his
supply
of
food
except
salt
pepper
coffee
and
sugar
of
which
he
had
a
quantity
there
were
deer
in
the
brakes
but
as
he
could
not
get
close
enough
to
kill
them
with
a
revolver
he
had
to
satisfy
himself
with
a
rabbit
he
knew
he
might
as
well
content
himself
with
the
hard
fare
that
assuredly
would
be
his
lot
somewhere
up
this
river
there
was
a
village
called
huntsville
it
was
distant
about
a
hundred
miles
from
wellston
and
had
a
reputation
throughout
southwestern
texas
he
had
never
been
there
the
fact
was
this
reputation
was
such
that
honest
travelers
gave
the
town
a
wide
berth
duane
had
considerable
money
for
him
in
his
possession
and
he
concluded
to
visit
huntsville
if
he
could
find
it
and
buy
a
stock
of
provisions
the
following
day
toward
evening
he
happened
upon
a
road
which
he
believed
might
lead
to
the
village
there
were
a
good
many
fresh
in
the
sand
and
these
made
him
thoughtful
nevertheless
he
followed
the
road
proceeding
cautiously
he
had
not
gone
very
far
when
the
sound
of
rapid
caught
his
ears
they
came
from
his
rear
in
the
darkening
twilight
he
could
not
see
any
great
distance
back
along
the
road
voices
however
warned
him
that
these
riders
whoever
they
were
had
approached
closer
than
he
liked
to
go
farther
down
the
road
was
not
to
be
thought
of
so
he
turned
a
little
way
in
among
the
mesquites
and
halted
hoping
to
escape
being
seen
or
heard
as
he
was
now
a
fugitive
it
seemed
every
man
was
his
enemy
and
pursuer
the
horsemen
were
fast
approaching
presently
they
were
abreast
of
duane
position
so
near
that
he
could
hear
the
creak
of
saddles
the
clink
of
spurs
he
crossed
the
river
below
said
one
man
reckon
you
right
bill
he
slipped
us
replied
another
rangers
or
a
posse
of
ranchers
in
pursuit
of
a
fugitive
the
knowledge
gave
duane
a
strange
thrill
certainly
they
could
not
have
been
hunting
him
but
the
feeling
their
proximity
gave
him
was
identical
to
what
it
would
have
been
had
he
been
this
particular
hunted
man
he
held
his
breath
he
clenched
his
teeth
he
pressed
a
quieting
hand
upon
his
horse
suddenly
he
became
aware
that
these
horsemen
had
halted
they
were
whispering
he
could
just
make
out
a
dark
group
closely
massed
what
had
made
them
halt
so
suspiciously
wrong
bill
said
a
man
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
idee
of
hearin
a
hoss
heave
you
a
ranger
and
on
killin
that
rustler
now
i
say
let
go
home
and
i
just
take
a
look
at
the
sand
replied
the
man
called
bill
duane
heard
the
clink
of
spurs
on
steel
stirrup
and
the
thud
of
boots
on
the
ground
there
followed
a
short
silence
which
was
broken
by
a
sharply
breathed
exclamation
duane
waited
for
no
more
they
had
found
his
trail
he
spurred
his
horse
straight
into
the
brush
at
the
second
crashing
bound
there
came
yells
from
the
road
and
then
shots
duane
heard
the
hiss
of
a
bullet
close
by
his
ear
and
as
it
struck
a
branch
it
made
a
peculiar
singing
sound
these
shots
and
the
proximity
of
that
lead
missile
roused
in
duane
a
quick
hot
resentment
which
mounted
into
a
passion
almost
ungovernable
he
must
escape
yet
it
seemed
that
he
did
not
care
whether
he
did
or
not
something
grim
kept
urging
him
to
halt
and
return
the
fire
of
these
men
after
running
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
he
raised
himself
from
over
the
pommel
where
he
had
bent
to
avoid
the
stinging
branches
and
tried
to
guide
his
horse
in
the
dark
shadows
under
mesquites
and
cottonwoods
he
was
hard
put
to
it
to
find
open
passage
however
he
succeeded
so
well
and
made
such
little
noise
that
gradually
he
drew
away
from
his
pursuers
the
sound
of
their
horses
crashing
through
the
thickets
died
away
duane
reined
in
and
listened
he
had
distanced
them
probably
they
would
go
into
camp
till
daylight
then
follow
his
tracks
he
started
on
again
walking
his
horse
and
peered
sharply
at
the
ground
so
that
he
might
take
advantage
of
the
first
trail
he
crossed
it
seemed
a
long
while
until
he
came
upon
one
he
followed
it
until
a
late
hour
when
striking
the
willow
brakes
again
and
hence
the
neighborhood
of
the
river
he
picketed
his
horse
and
lay
down
to
rest
but
he
did
not
sleep
his
mind
bitterly
revolved
the
fate
that
had
come
upon
him
he
made
efforts
to
think
of
other
things
but
in
vain
every
moment
he
expected
the
chill
the
sense
of
loneliness
that
yet
was
ominous
of
a
strange
visitation
the
peculiarly
imagined
lights
and
shades
of
the
night
these
things
that
presaged
the
coming
of
cal
bain
doggedly
duane
fought
against
the
insidious
phantom
he
kept
telling
himself
that
it
was
just
imagination
that
it
would
wear
off
in
time
still
in
his
heart
he
did
not
believe
what
he
hoped
but
he
would
not
give
up
he
would
not
accept
the
ghost
of
his
victim
as
a
reality
gray
dawn
found
him
in
the
saddle
again
headed
for
the
river
half
an
hour
of
riding
brought
him
to
the
dense
chaparral
and
willow
thickets
these
he
threaded
to
come
at
length
to
the
ford
it
was
a
gravel
bottom
and
therefore
an
easy
crossing
once
upon
the
opposite
shore
he
reined
in
his
horse
and
looked
darkly
back
this
action
marked
his
acknowledgment
of
his
situation
he
had
voluntarily
sought
the
refuge
of
the
outlaws
he
was
beyond
the
pale
a
bitter
and
passionate
curse
passed
his
lips
as
he
spurred
his
horse
into
the
brakes
on
that
alien
shore
he
rode
perhaps
twenty
miles
not
sparing
his
horse
nor
caring
whether
or
not
he
left
a
plain
trail
them
hunt
me
he
muttered
when
the
heat
of
the
day
began
to
be
oppressive
and
hunger
and
thirst
made
themselves
manifest
duane
began
to
look
about
him
for
a
place
to
halt
for
the
the
trail
led
into
a
road
which
was
hard
packed
and
smooth
from
the
tracks
of
cattle
he
doubted
not
that
he
had
come
across
one
of
the
roads
used
by
border
raiders
he
headed
into
it
and
had
scarcely
traveled
a
mile
when
turning
a
curve
he
came
upon
a
single
horseman
riding
toward
him
both
riders
wheeled
their
mounts
sharply
and
were
ready
to
run
and
shoot
back
not
more
than
a
hundred
paces
separated
them
they
stood
then
for
a
moment
watching
each
other
stranger
called
the
man
dropping
his
hand
from
his
hip
replied
duane
shortly
they
rode
toward
each
other
closing
half
the
gap
then
they
halted
again
seen
you
ai
no
ranger
called
the
rider
shore
i
he
laughed
loudly
as
if
he
had
made
a
joke
you
know
i
was
a
ranger
asked
duane
curiously
somehow
he
had
instantly
divined
that
his
horseman
was
no
officer
or
even
a
rancher
trailing
stolen
stock
said
the
fellow
starting
his
horse
forward
at
a
walk
ranger
never
git
ready
to
run
the
other
way
from
one
he
laughed
again
he
was
small
and
wiry
slouchy
of
attire
and
armed
to
the
teeth
and
he
bestrode
a
fine
bay
horse
he
had
quick
dancing
brown
eyes
at
once
frank
and
bold
and
a
coarse
bronzed
face
evidently
he
was
a
ruffian
duane
acknowledged
the
truth
of
the
assertion
and
turned
over
in
his
mind
how
shrewdly
the
fellow
had
guessed
him
to
be
a
hunted
man
name
luke
stevens
an
i
hail
from
the
river
who
you
said
this
stranger
duane
was
silent
reckon
you
buck
duane
went
on
stevens
heerd
you
was
a
damn
bad
man
with
a
this
time
duane
laughed
not
at
the
doubtful
compliment
but
at
the
idea
that
the
first
outlaw
he
met
should
know
him
here
was
proof
of
how
swiftly
facts
about
traveled
on
the
texas
border
buck
said
stevens
in
a
friendly
manner
ai
presumin
on
your
time
or
company
i
see
you
headin
fer
the
river
but
will
you
stop
long
enough
to
stake
a
feller
to
a
bite
of
grub
out
of
grub
and
pretty
hungry
myself
admitted
duane
pushin
your
hoss
i
see
wal
i
reckon
you
better
stock
up
before
you
hit
thet
stretch
of
he
made
a
wide
sweep
of
his
right
arm
indicating
the
southwest
and
there
was
that
in
his
action
which
seemed
significant
of
a
vast
and
barren
region
up
queried
duane
thoughtfully
a
feller
has
jest
got
to
eat
i
can
rustle
along
without
whisky
but
not
without
grub
thet
what
makes
it
so
embarrassin
these
parts
dodgin
your
shadow
now
i
on
my
way
to
mercer
a
little
town
up
the
river
a
ways
i
goin
to
pack
out
some
stevens
tone
was
inviting
evidently
he
would
welcome
companionship
but
he
did
not
openly
say
so
duane
kept
silence
however
and
then
stevens
went
on
in
this
here
country
two
a
crowd
it
safer
i
never
was
much
on
this
dodgin
though
i
done
it
of
necessity
it
takes
a
damn
good
man
to
travel
alone
any
length
of
time
why
i
been
thet
sick
i
was
jest
achin
fer
some
ranger
to
come
along
an
plug
me
give
me
a
pardner
any
day
now
mebbe
you
not
thet
kind
of
a
feller
an
i
shore
not
presumin
to
ask
but
i
just
declares
myself
mean
you
like
me
to
go
with
you
asked
duane
stevens
grinned
i
should
smile
i
be
particular
proud
to
be
braced
with
a
man
of
your
here
my
good
fellow
that
all
nonsense
declared
duane
in
some
haste
i
think
modesty
becomin
to
a
youngster
replied
stevens
hate
a
brag
an
i
no
use
fer
these
cowboys
thet
always
lookin
fer
trouble
an
talkin
buck
i
do
know
much
about
you
but
every
man
who
lived
along
the
texas
border
remembers
a
lot
about
your
dad
it
was
expected
of
you
i
reckon
an
much
of
your
rep
was
established
before
you
thronged
your
gun
i
jest
heerd
thet
you
was
lightnin
on
the
draw
an
when
you
cut
loose
with
a
gun
why
the
figger
on
the
ace
of
spades
would
cover
your
cluster
of
thet
the
word
thet
gone
down
the
border
it
the
kind
of
reputation
most
sure
to
fly
far
an
swift
ahead
of
a
man
in
this
country
an
the
safest
too
i
gamble
on
thet
it
the
land
of
the
draw
i
see
now
you
only
a
boy
though
you
shore
a
strappin
husky
one
now
buck
i
not
a
spring
chicken
an
i
been
long
on
the
dodge
mebbe
a
little
of
my
society
wo
hurt
you
none
you
need
to
learn
the
there
was
something
sincere
and
likable
about
this
outlaw
dare
say
you
right
replied
duane
quietly
i
go
to
mercer
with
next
moment
he
was
riding
down
the
road
with
stevens
duane
had
never
been
much
of
a
talker
and
now
he
found
speech
difficult
but
his
companion
did
not
seem
to
mind
that
he
was
a
jocose
voluble
fellow
probably
glad
now
to
hear
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
duane
listened
and
sometimes
he
thought
with
a
pang
of
the
distinction
of
name
and
heritage
of
blood
his
father
had
left
to
him
chapter
iii
late
that
day
a
couple
of
hours
before
sunset
duane
and
stevens
having
rested
their
horses
in
the
shade
of
some
mesquites
near
the
town
of
mercer
saddled
up
and
prepared
to
move
as
we
lookin
fer
grub
an
not
trouble
i
reckon
you
better
hang
up
out
here
stevens
was
saying
as
he
mounted
see
towns
an
sheriffs
an
rangers
are
always
lookin
fer
new
fellers
gone
bad
they
sort
of
forget
most
of
the
old
boys
except
those
as
are
plumb
bad
now
nobody
in
mercer
will
take
notice
of
me
reckon
there
been
a
thousand
men
run
into
the
river
country
to
become
outlaws
since
yours
truly
you
jest
wait
here
an
be
ready
to
ride
hard
mebbe
my
sin
will
go
operatin
in
spite
of
my
good
intentions
in
which
case
there
be
his
pause
was
significant
he
grinned
and
his
brown
eyes
danced
with
a
kind
of
wild
humor
have
you
got
any
money
asked
duane
exclaimed
luke
blankly
i
have
owned
a
piece
since
wal
fer
some
furnish
money
for
grub
returned
duane
for
whisky
too
providing
you
hurry
back
here
without
making
you
a
downright
good
pard
declared
stevens
in
admiration
as
he
took
the
money
give
my
word
buck
an
i
here
to
say
i
never
broke
it
yet
lay
low
an
look
fer
me
back
with
that
he
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
out
of
the
mesquites
toward
the
town
at
that
distance
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
mercer
appeared
to
be
a
cluster
of
low
adobe
houses
set
in
a
grove
of
cottonwoods
pastures
of
alfalfa
were
dotted
by
horses
and
cattle
duane
saw
a
driving
in
a
meager
flock
presently
stevens
rode
out
of
sight
into
the
town
duane
waited
hoping
the
outlaw
would
make
good
his
word
probably
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
elapsed
when
duane
heard
the
clear
reports
of
a
winchester
rifle
the
clatter
of
rapid
and
yells
unmistakably
the
kind
to
mean
danger
for
a
man
like
stevens
duane
mounted
and
rode
to
the
edge
of
the
mesquites
he
saw
a
cloud
of
dust
down
the
road
and
a
bay
horse
running
fast
stevens
apparently
had
not
been
wounded
by
any
of
the
shots
for
he
had
a
steady
seat
in
his
saddle
and
his
riding
even
at
that
moment
struck
duane
as
admirable
he
carried
a
large
pack
over
the
pommel
and
he
kept
looking
back
the
shots
had
ceased
but
the
yells
increased
duane
saw
several
men
running
and
waving
their
arms
then
he
spurred
his
horse
and
got
into
a
swift
stride
so
stevens
would
not
pass
him
presently
the
outlaw
caught
up
with
him
stevens
was
grinning
but
there
was
now
no
fun
in
the
dancing
eyes
it
was
a
devil
that
danced
in
them
his
face
seemed
a
shade
paler
jest
comin
out
of
the
store
yelled
stevens
plumb
into
a
rancher
who
knowed
me
he
opened
up
with
a
rifle
think
they
chase
they
covered
several
miles
before
there
were
any
signs
of
pursuit
and
when
horsemen
did
move
into
sight
out
of
the
cottonwoods
duane
and
his
companion
steadily
drew
farther
away
hosses
in
thet
bunch
to
worry
us
called
out
stevens
duane
had
the
same
conviction
and
he
did
not
look
back
again
he
rode
somewhat
to
the
fore
and
was
constantly
aware
of
the
rapid
thudding
of
hoofs
behind
as
stevens
kept
close
to
him
at
sunset
they
reached
the
willow
brakes
and
the
river
duane
horse
was
winded
and
lashed
with
sweat
and
lather
it
was
not
until
the
crossing
had
been
accomplished
that
duane
halted
to
rest
his
animal
stevens
was
riding
up
the
low
sandy
bank
he
reeled
in
the
saddle
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
duane
leaped
off
and
ran
to
the
outlaw
side
stevens
was
pale
and
his
face
bore
beads
of
sweat
the
whole
front
of
his
shirt
was
soaked
with
blood
shot
cried
duane
who
hell
said
i
was
would
you
mind
givin
me
a
lift
on
this
here
pack
duane
lifted
the
heavy
pack
down
and
then
helped
stevens
to
dismount
the
outlaw
had
a
bloody
foam
on
his
lips
and
he
was
spitting
blood
why
did
you
say
so
cried
duane
never
thought
you
seemed
all
luke
stevens
may
be
as
gabby
as
an
old
woman
but
sometimes
he
does
say
anythin
it
would
have
done
no
duane
bade
him
sit
down
removed
his
shirt
and
washed
the
blood
from
his
breast
and
back
stevens
had
been
shot
in
the
breast
fairly
low
down
and
the
bullet
had
gone
clear
through
him
his
ride
holding
himself
and
that
heavy
pack
in
the
saddle
had
been
a
feat
little
short
of
marvelous
duane
did
not
see
how
it
had
been
possible
and
he
felt
no
hope
for
the
outlaw
but
he
plugged
the
wounds
and
bound
them
tightly
name
was
brown
stevens
said
an
him
fell
out
over
a
hoss
i
stole
from
him
over
in
huntsville
we
had
a
then
wal
as
i
was
straddlin
my
hoss
back
there
in
mercer
i
seen
this
brown
an
seen
him
before
he
seen
me
could
have
killed
him
too
but
i
breakin
my
word
to
you
i
kind
of
hoped
he
would
spot
me
but
he
did
an
fust
shot
he
got
me
here
what
do
you
think
of
this
hole
pretty
bad
replied
duane
and
he
could
not
look
the
cheerful
outlaw
in
the
eyes
reckon
it
is
wal
i
had
some
bad
wounds
i
lived
over
guess
mebbe
i
can
stand
this
one
now
buck
get
me
some
place
in
the
brakes
leave
me
some
grub
an
water
at
my
hand
an
then
you
clear
you
here
alone
asked
duane
sharply
you
see
i
ca
keep
up
with
you
brown
an
his
friends
will
foller
us
across
the
river
a
ways
you
got
to
think
of
number
one
in
this
would
you
do
in
my
case
asked
duane
curiously
i
reckon
i
clear
out
an
save
my
hide
replied
stevens
duane
felt
inclined
to
doubt
the
outlaw
assertion
for
his
own
part
he
decided
his
conduct
without
further
speech
first
he
watered
the
horses
filled
canteens
and
water
bag
and
then
tied
the
pack
upon
his
own
horse
that
done
he
lifted
stevens
upon
his
horse
and
holding
him
in
the
saddle
turned
into
the
brakes
being
careful
to
pick
out
hard
or
grassy
ground
that
left
little
signs
of
tracks
just
about
dark
he
ran
across
a
trail
that
stevens
said
was
a
good
one
to
take
into
the
wild
country
we
better
keep
right
on
in
the
dark
till
i
drop
concluded
stevens
with
a
laugh
all
that
night
duane
gloomy
and
thoughtful
attentive
to
the
wounded
outlaw
walked
the
trail
and
never
halted
till
daybreak
he
was
tired
then
and
very
hungry
stevens
seemed
in
bad
shape
although
he
was
still
spirited
and
cheerful
duane
made
camp
the
outlaw
refused
food
but
asked
for
both
whisky
and
water
then
he
stretched
out
will
you
take
off
my
boots
he
asked
with
a
faint
smile
on
his
pallid
face
duane
removed
them
wondering
if
the
outlaw
had
the
thought
that
he
did
not
want
to
die
with
his
boots
on
stevens
seemed
to
read
his
mind
my
old
daddy
used
to
say
thet
i
was
born
to
be
hanged
but
i
was
an
dyin
with
your
boots
on
is
the
next
wust
way
to
a
chance
get
over
this
said
duane
but
i
want
to
be
correct
about
the
boots
an
say
pard
if
i
do
go
over
jest
you
remember
thet
i
was
appreciatin
of
your
then
he
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
sleep
duane
could
not
find
water
for
the
horses
but
there
was
an
abundance
of
grass
upon
which
he
hobbled
them
after
that
was
done
he
prepared
himself
a
meal
the
sun
was
getting
warm
when
he
lay
down
to
sleep
and
when
he
awoke
it
was
sinking
in
the
west
stevens
was
still
alive
for
he
breathed
heavily
the
horses
were
in
sight
all
was
quiet
except
the
hum
of
insects
in
the
brush
duane
listened
awhile
then
rose
and
went
for
the
horses
when
he
returned
with
them
he
found
stevens
awake
cheerful
as
usual
and
apparently
stronger
buck
i
still
with
you
an
good
fer
another
night
ride
he
said
about
all
i
need
now
is
a
big
pull
on
thet
bottle
help
me
will
you
there
thet
was
bully
i
ai
swallowin
my
blood
this
evenin
mebbe
i
bled
all
there
was
in
while
duane
got
a
hurried
meal
for
himself
packed
up
the
little
outfit
and
saddled
the
horses
stevens
kept
on
talking
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
hurry
to
tell
duane
all
about
the
country
another
night
ride
would
put
them
beyond
fear
of
pursuit
within
striking
distance
of
the
rio
grande
and
the
of
the
outlaws
when
it
came
time
for
mounting
the
horses
stevens
said
you
can
pull
on
my
boots
once
in
spite
of
the
laugh
accompanying
the
words
duane
detected
a
subtle
change
in
the
outlaw
spirit
on
this
night
travel
was
facilitated
by
the
fact
that
the
trail
was
broad
enough
for
two
horses
abreast
enabling
duane
to
ride
while
upholding
stevens
in
the
saddle
the
difficulty
most
persistent
was
in
keeping
the
horses
in
a
walk
they
were
used
to
a
trot
and
that
kind
of
gait
would
not
do
for
stevens
the
red
died
out
of
the
west
a
pale
afterglow
prevailed
for
a
while
darkness
set
in
then
the
broad
expanse
of
blue
darkened
and
the
stars
brightened
after
a
while
stevens
ceased
talking
and
drooped
in
his
saddle
duane
kept
the
horses
going
however
and
the
slow
hours
wore
away
duane
thought
the
quiet
night
would
never
break
to
dawn
that
there
was
no
end
to
the
melancholy
brooding
plain
but
at
length
a
grayness
blotted
out
the
stars
and
mantled
the
level
of
mesquite
and
cactus
dawn
caught
the
fugitives
at
a
green
on
the
bank
of
a
rocky
little
stream
stevens
fell
a
dead
weight
into
duane
arms
and
one
look
at
the
haggard
face
showed
duane
that
the
outlaw
had
taken
his
last
ride
he
knew
it
too
yet
that
cheerfulness
prevailed
my
feet
are
orful
tired
packin
them
heavy
boots
he
said
and
seemed
immensely
relieved
when
duane
had
removed
them
this
matter
of
the
outlaw
boots
was
strange
duane
thought
he
made
stevens
as
comfortable
as
possible
then
attended
to
his
own
needs
and
the
outlaw
took
up
the
thread
of
his
conversation
where
he
had
left
off
the
night
before
trail
splits
up
a
ways
from
here
an
every
branch
of
it
leads
to
a
hole
where
you
find
men
a
few
mebbe
like
yourself
some
like
me
an
gangs
of
rustlers
an
such
it
easy
livin
buck
i
reckon
though
that
you
not
find
it
easy
never
mix
in
you
be
a
lone
wolf
i
seen
that
right
off
wal
if
a
man
can
stand
the
loneliness
an
if
he
quick
on
the
draw
mebbe
it
is
the
best
shore
i
do
know
but
these
fellers
in
here
will
be
suspicious
of
a
man
who
goes
it
alone
if
they
get
a
chance
they
kill
stevens
asked
for
water
several
times
he
had
forgotten
or
he
did
not
want
the
whisky
his
voice
grew
perceptibly
weaker
quiet
said
duane
uses
up
your
i
talk
till
i
done
he
replied
doggedly
here
pard
you
can
gamble
on
what
i
tellin
you
an
it
be
useful
from
this
camp
we
you
meet
men
right
along
an
none
of
them
will
be
honest
men
all
the
same
some
are
others
i
lived
along
the
river
fer
twelve
years
there
three
big
gangs
of
outlaws
king
fisher
you
know
him
i
reckon
fer
he
half
the
time
livin
among
respectable
folks
king
is
a
pretty
good
feller
it
do
to
tie
up
with
him
ant
his
gang
now
there
cheseldine
who
hangs
out
in
the
rim
rock
way
up
the
river
he
an
outlaw
chief
i
never
seen
him
though
i
stayed
once
right
in
his
camp
late
years
he
got
rich
an
keeps
back
pretty
well
hid
but
bland
i
knowed
bland
fer
years
an
i
have
any
use
fer
him
bland
has
the
biggest
gang
you
ai
likely
to
miss
strikin
his
place
sometime
or
other
he
got
a
regular
town
i
might
say
shore
some
gamblin
an
goin
on
at
bland
camp
all
the
time
bland
has
killed
some
twenty
men
an
thet
not
countin
here
stevens
took
another
drink
and
then
rested
for
a
while
ai
likely
to
get
on
with
bland
he
resumed
presently
too
strappin
big
an
to
please
the
chief
fer
he
got
women
in
his
camp
then
he
be
jealous
of
your
possibilities
with
a
gun
shore
i
reckon
he
be
careful
though
bland
no
fool
an
he
loves
his
hide
i
reckon
any
of
the
other
gangs
would
be
better
fer
you
when
you
ai
goin
it
apparently
that
exhausted
the
fund
of
information
and
advice
stevens
had
been
eager
to
impart
he
lapsed
into
silence
and
lay
with
closed
eyes
meanwhile
the
sun
rose
warm
the
breeze
waved
the
mesquites
the
birds
came
down
to
splash
in
the
shallow
stream
duane
dozed
in
a
comfortable
seat
by
and
by
something
roused
him
stevens
was
once
more
talking
but
with
a
changed
tone
name
was
brown
he
rambled
fell
out
over
a
hoss
i
stole
from
him
in
huntsville
he
stole
it
fuss
brown
one
of
them
sneaks
afraid
of
the
open
he
steals
an
pretends
to
be
honest
say
buck
mebbe
you
meet
brown
some
day
you
an
me
are
pards
remember
if
i
ever
meet
him
said
duane
that
seemed
to
satisfy
the
outlaw
presently
he
tried
to
lift
his
head
but
had
not
the
strength
a
strange
shade
was
creeping
across
the
bronzed
rough
face
feet
are
pretty
heavy
shore
you
got
my
boots
off
duane
held
them
up
but
was
not
certain
that
stevens
could
see
them
the
outlaw
closed
his
eyes
again
and
muttered
incoherently
then
he
fell
asleep
duane
believed
that
sleep
was
final
the
day
passed
with
duane
watching
and
waiting
toward
sundown
stevens
awoke
and
his
eyes
seemed
clearer
duane
went
to
get
some
fresh
water
thinking
his
comrade
would
surely
want
some
when
he
returned
stevens
made
no
sign
that
he
wanted
anything
there
was
something
bright
about
him
and
suddenly
duane
realized
what
it
meant
you
stuck
to
me
the
outlaw
whispered
duane
caught
a
hint
of
gladness
in
the
voice
he
traced
a
faint
surprise
in
the
haggard
face
stevens
seemed
like
a
little
child
to
duane
the
moment
was
sad
elemental
big
with
a
burden
of
mystery
he
could
not
understand
duane
buried
him
in
a
shallow
arroyo
and
heaped
up
a
pile
of
stones
to
mark
the
grave
that
done
he
saddled
his
comrade
horse
hung
the
weapons
over
the
pommel
and
mounting
his
own
steed
he
rode
down
the
trail
in
the
gathering
twilight
chapter
iv
two
days
later
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
duane
dragged
the
two
horses
up
the
last
ascent
of
an
exceedingly
rough
trail
and
found
himself
on
top
of
the
rim
rock
with
a
beautiful
green
valley
at
his
feet
the
yellow
sluggish
rio
grande
shining
in
the
sun
and
the
great
wild
mountainous
barren
of
mexico
stretching
to
the
south
duane
had
not
fallen
in
with
any
travelers
he
had
taken
the
trail
he
had
come
across
where
it
had
led
him
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
except
that
here
was
the
river
and
probably
the
inclosed
valley
was
the
retreat
of
some
famous
outlaw
no
wonder
outlaws
were
safe
in
that
wild
refuge
duane
had
spent
the
last
two
days
climbing
the
roughest
and
most
difficult
trail
he
had
ever
seen
from
the
looks
of
the
descent
he
imagined
the
worst
part
of
his
travel
was
yet
to
come
not
improbably
it
was
two
thousand
feet
down
to
the
river
the
valley
green
with
alfalfa
and
cottonwood
and
nestling
down
amid
the
bare
walls
of
yellow
rock
was
a
delight
and
a
relief
to
his
tired
eyes
eager
to
get
down
to
a
level
and
to
find
a
place
to
rest
duane
began
the
descent
the
trail
proved
to
be
the
kind
that
could
not
be
descended
slowly
he
kept
dodging
rocks
which
his
horses
loosed
behind
him
and
in
a
short
time
he
reached
the
valley
entering
at
the
apex
of
the
wedge
a
stream
of
clear
water
tumbled
out
of
the
rocks
here
and
most
of
it
ran
into
his
horses
drank
thirstily
and
he
drank
with
that
fullness
and
gratefulness
common
to
the
desert
traveler
finding
sweet
water
then
he
mounted
and
rode
down
the
valley
wondering
what
would
be
his
reception
the
valley
was
much
larger
than
it
had
appeared
from
the
high
elevation
well
watered
green
with
grass
and
tree
and
farmed
evidently
by
good
hands
it
gave
duane
a
considerable
surprise
horses
and
cattle
were
everywhere
every
clump
of
cottonwoods
surrounded
a
small
adobe
house
duane
saw
mexicans
working
in
the
fields
and
horsemen
going
to
and
fro
presently
he
passed
a
house
bigger
than
the
others
with
a
porch
attached
a
woman
young
and
pretty
he
thought
watched
him
from
a
door
no
one
else
appeared
to
notice
him
presently
the
trail
widened
into
a
road
and
that
into
a
kind
of
square
lined
by
a
number
of
adobe
and
log
buildings
of
rudest
structure
within
sight
were
horses
dogs
a
couple
of
steers
mexican
women
with
children
and
white
men
all
of
whom
appeared
to
be
doing
nothing
his
advent
created
no
interest
until
he
rode
up
to
the
white
men
who
were
lolling
in
the
shade
of
a
house
this
place
evidently
was
a
store
and
saloon
and
from
the
inside
came
a
lazy
hum
of
voices
as
duane
reined
to
a
halt
one
of
the
loungers
in
the
shade
rose
with
a
loud
exclamation
me
if
thet
ai
luke
hoss
the
others
accorded
their
interest
if
not
assent
by
rising
to
advance
toward
duane
about
it
euchre
ai
thet
luke
bay
queried
the
first
man
as
your
nose
replied
the
fellow
called
euchre
ai
no
doubt
about
thet
then
laughed
another
nose
is
shore
plain
on
the
these
men
lined
up
before
duane
and
as
he
coolly
regarded
them
he
thought
they
could
have
been
recognized
anywhere
as
desperadoes
the
man
called
bosomer
who
had
stepped
forward
had
a
forbidding
face
which
showed
yellow
eyes
an
enormous
nose
and
a
skin
the
color
of
dust
with
a
thatch
of
sandy
hair
who
are
you
an
where
in
the
hell
did
you
git
thet
bay
hoss
he
demanded
his
yellow
eyes
took
in
stevens
horse
then
the
weapons
hung
on
the
saddle
and
finally
turned
their
glinting
hard
light
upward
to
duane
duane
did
not
like
the
tone
in
which
he
had
been
addressed
and
he
remained
silent
at
least
half
his
mind
seemed
busy
with
curious
interest
in
regard
to
something
that
leaped
inside
him
and
made
his
breast
feel
tight
he
recognized
it
as
that
strange
emotion
which
had
shot
through
him
often
of
late
and
which
had
decided
him
to
go
out
to
the
meeting
with
bain
only
now
it
was
different
more
powerful
who
are
you
asked
another
man
somewhat
more
civilly
name
duane
replied
duane
curtly
how
you
come
by
the
hoss
duane
answered
briefly
and
his
words
were
followed
by
a
short
silence
during
which
the
men
looked
at
him
bosomer
began
to
twist
the
ends
of
his
beard
he
dead
all
right
or
nobody
hev
his
hoss
an
guns
presently
said
euchre
duane
began
bosomer
in
low
stinging
tones
happen
to
be
luke
stevens
duane
looked
him
over
from
dusty
boots
to
his
slouchy
sombrero
that
look
seemed
to
inflame
bosomer
i
want
the
hoss
an
them

he
shouted
or
anybody
else
can
have
them
for
all
i
care

just
fetched
them
in
but

pack

mine
replied
duane
say
i
befriended

ca
use
a
civil
tongue

rejoined
the
outlaw
do

plug
stevens
an

hoss
an
jest
happened
to
stumble
down
here
have
to
take
my
word
that
all
replied
duane
sharply
ai
takin
your
word
savvy
thet
an
i
was
luke
pard
with
that
bosomer
wheeled
and
pushing
his
companions
aside
he
stamped
into
the
saloon
where
his
voice
broke
out
in
a
roar
duane
dismounted
and
threw
his
bridle
bosomer
is
shore
said
the
man
euchre
he
did
not
appear
unfriendly
nor
were
the
others
hostile
at
this
juncture
several
more
outlaws
crowded
out
of
the
door
and
the
one
in
the
lead
was
a
tall
man
of
stalwart
physique
his
manner
proclaimed
him
a
leader
he
had
a
long
face
a
flaming
red
beard
and
clear
cold
blue
eyes
that
fixed
in
close
scrutiny
upon
duane
he
was
not
a
texan
in
truth
duane
did
not
recognize
one
of
these
outlaws
as
native
to
his
state
bland
said
the
tall
man
authoritatively
you
and
you
doing
here
duane
looked
at
bland
as
he
had
at
the
others
this
outlaw
chief
appeared
to
be
reasonable
if
he
was
not
courteous
duane
told
his
story
again
this
time
a
little
more
in
detail
believe
you
replied
bland
at
once
i
know
when
a
fellow
is
reckon
you
on
the
right
trail
put
in
euchre
about
luke
wantin
his
boots
took
off
thet
satisfies
me
luke
hed
a
mortal
dread
of
dyin
with
his
boots
at
this
sally
the
chief
and
his
men
laughed
said
duane
buck
duane
queried
bland
you
a
son
of
that
duane
who
was
a
gunfighter
some
years
back
replied
duane
met
him
and
glad
i
did
said
bland
with
a
grim
humor
you
got
in
trouble
and
had
to
go
on
the
dodge
what
kind
of
trouble
a
do
you
mean
questioned
bland
he
seemed
eager
curious
speculative
it
ended
in
i
sorry
to
say
answered
duane
i
need
ask
the
son
of
duane
if
he
killed
his
man
went
on
bland
ironically
i
sorry
you
bucked
against
trouble
in
my
camp
but
as
it
is
i
guess
you
be
wise
to
make
yourself
you
mean
i
politely
told
to
move
on
asked
duane
quietly
exactly
that
said
bland
as
if
irritated
this
is
a
free
place
there
is
one
on
earth
every
man
is
equal
here
do
you
want
to
join
my
band
i
even
if
you
did
i
imagine
that
would
stop
bosomer
he
an
ugly
fellow
he
one
of
the
few
gunmen
i
met
who
wants
to
kill
somebody
all
the
time
most
men
like
that
are
fourflushes
but
bosomer
is
all
one
color
and
that
red
merely
for
your
own
sake
i
advise
you
to
hit
the
but
if
that
all
i
stay
returned
duane
even
as
he
spoke
he
felt
that
he
did
not
know
himself
bosomer
appeared
at
the
door
pushing
men
who
tried
to
detain
him
and
as
he
jumped
clear
of
a
last
reaching
hand
he
uttered
a
snarl
like
an
angry
dog
manifestly
the
short
while
he
had
spent
inside
the
saloon
had
been
devoted
to
drinking
and
talking
himself
into
a
frenzy
bland
and
the
other
outlaws
quickly
moved
aside
letting
duane
stand
alone
when
bosomer
saw
duane
standing
motionless
and
watchful
a
strange
change
passed
quickly
in
him
he
halted
in
his
tracks
and
as
he
did
that
the
men
who
had
followed
him
out
piled
over
one
another
in
their
hurry
to
get
to
one
side
duane
saw
all
the
swift
action
felt
intuitively
the
meaning
of
it
and
in
bosomer
sudden
change
of
front
the
outlaw
was
keen
and
he
had
expected
a
shrinking
or
at
least
a
frightened
antagonist
duane
knew
he
was
neither
he
felt
like
iron
and
yet
thrill
after
thrill
ran
through
him
it
was
almost
as
if
this
situation
had
been
one
long
familiar
to
him
somehow
he
understood
this
bosomer
the
outlaw
had
come
out
to
kill
him
and
now
though
somewhat
checked
by
the
stand
of
a
stranger
he
still
meant
to
kill
like
so
many
desperadoes
of
his
ilk
he
was
victim
of
a
passion
to
kill
for
the
sake
of
killing
duane
divined
that
no
sudden
animosity
was
driving
bosomer
it
was
just
his
chance
in
that
moment
murder
would
have
been
joy
to
him
very
likely
he
had
forgotten
his
pretext
for
a
quarrel
very
probably
his
faculties
were
absorbed
in
conjecture
as
to
duane
possibilities
but
he
did
not
speak
a
word
he
remained
motionless
for
a
long
moment
his
eyes
pale
and
steady
his
right
hand
like
a
claw
that
instant
gave
duane
a
power
to
read
in
his
enemy
eyes
the
thought
that
preceded
action
but
duane
did
not
want
to
kill
another
man
still
he
would
have
to
fight
and
he
decided
to
cripple
bosomer
when
bosomer
hand
moved
duane
gun
was
spouting
fire
two
shots
only
both
from
duane
gun
and
the
outlaw
fell
with
his
right
arm
shattered
bosomer
cursed
harshly
and
floundered
in
the
dust
trying
to
reach
the
gun
with
his
left
hand
his
comrades
however
seeing
that
duane
would
not
kill
unless
forced
closed
in
upon
bosomer
and
prevented
any
further
madness
on
his
part
chapter
v
of
the
outlaws
present
euchre
appeared
to
be
the
one
most
inclined
to
lend
friendliness
to
curiosity
and
he
led
duane
and
the
horses
away
to
a
small
adobe
shack
he
tied
the
horses
in
an
open
shed
and
removed
their
saddles
then
gathering
up
stevens
weapons
he
invited
his
visitor
to
enter
the
house
it
had
two
rooms
windows
without
coverings
bare
floors
one
room
contained
blankets
weapons
saddles
and
bridles
the
other
a
stone
fireplace
rude
table
and
bench
two
bunks
a
box
cupboard
and
various
blackened
utensils
yourself
to
home
as
long
as
you
want
to
stay
said
euchre
ai
rich
in
this
world
goods
but
i
own
what
here
an
i
stay
awhile
and
rest
i
pretty
well
played
out
replied
duane
euchre
gave
him
a
keen
glance
ahead
an
rest
i
take
your
horses
to
euchre
left
duane
alone
in
the
house
duane
relaxed
then
and
mechanically
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
face
he
was
laboring
under
some
kind
of
a
spell
or
shock
which
did
not
pass
off
quickly
when
it
had
worn
away
he
took
off
his
coat
and
belt
and
made
himself
comfortable
on
the
blankets
and
he
had
a
thought
that
if
he
rested
or
slept
what
difference
would
it
make
on
the
morrow
no
rest
no
sleep
could
change
the
gray
outlook
of
the
future
he
felt
glad
when
euchre
came
bustling
in
and
for
the
first
time
he
took
notice
of
the
outlaw
euchre
was
old
in
years
what
little
hair
he
had
was
gray
his
face
and
full
of
wrinkles
his
eyes
were
half
shut
from
long
gazing
through
the
sun
and
dust
he
stooped
but
his
thin
frame
denoted
strength
and
endurance
still
unimpaired
a
drink
or
a
smoke
he
asked
duane
shook
his
head
he
had
not
been
unfamiliar
with
whisky
and
he
had
used
tobacco
moderately
since
he
was
sixteen
but
now
strangely
he
felt
a
disgust
at
the
idea
of
stimulants
he
did
not
understand
clearly
what
he
felt
there
was
that
vague
idea
of
something
wild
in
his
blood
something
that
made
him
fear
himself
euchre
wagged
his
old
head
sympathetically
you
feel
a
little
sick
when
it
comes
to
shootin
i
run
what
your
age

duane

relief
in
talking

more
about

the
old
man

on
this
river

years

seen
hundreds
of
boys
come
in
on
the
dodge
most
of
them
though

i
bunked
with
bank
cashiers
forgers
plain
thieves
an
murderers
all
of
which
had
no
bizness

texas

the

for
a
peaceable
decent
feller
i
heard
you
tell
bland
you
would
join
his
gang
thet
not
make
him

a
likin

or
rustle

decent
feller

do
you
ca
herd

greasers

bland
men
would
shoot
at
you
in
the
fields
what
you
do
son
knows
replied
duane
hopelessly
make
my
money
last
as
long
as
possible
then
i
pretty
pore
but
you
never
starve
while
i
got
here
it
struck
duane
again
that
something
human
and
kind
and
eager
which
he
had
seen
in
stevens
duane
estimate
of
outlaws
had
lacked
this
quality
he
had
not
accorded
them
any
virtues
to
him
as
to
the
outside
world
they
had
been
merely
vicious
men
without
one
redeeming
feature
much
obliged
to
you
euchre
replied
duane
of
course
i
live
with
any
one
unless
i
can
pay
my
it
any
way
you
like
my
son
said
euchre
make
a
fire
an
i
set
about
gettin
grub
i
a
sourdough
buck
thet
man
does
live
who
can
beat
my
do
you
ever
pack
supplies
in
here
asked
duane
thinking
of
the
almost
inaccessible
nature
of
the
valley
comes
across
from
mexico
an
the
rest
down
the
river
thet
river
trip
is
a
bird
it
more
five
hundred
miles
to
any
supply
point
bland
has
mozos
greaser
boatmen
sometimes
too
he
gets
supplies
in
from
you
see
bland
sells
thousands
of
cattle
in
cuba
all
this
stock
has
to
go
down
by
boat
to
meet
the
on
earth
are
the
cattle
driven
down
to
the
river
asked
duane
not
my
secret
replied
euchre
shortly
is
i
do
know
i
rustled
cattle
for
bland
but
he
never
sent
me
through
the
rim
rock
with
duane
experienced
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
the
realization
that
interest
had
been
stirred
in
him
he
was
curious
about
bland
and
his
gang
and
glad
to
have
something
to
think
about
for
every
once
in
a
while
he
had
a
sensation
that
was
almost
like
a
pang
he
wanted
to
forget
in
the
next
hour
he
did
forget
and
enjoyed
helping
in
the
preparation
and
eating
of
the
meal
euchre
after
washing
and
hanging
up
the
several
utensils
put
on
his
hat
and
turned
to
go
out
along
or
stay
here
as
you
want
he
said
to
duane
stay
rejoined
duane
slowly
the
old
outlaw
left
the
room
and
trudged
away
whistling
cheerfully
duane
looked
around
him
for
a
book
or
paper
anything
to
read
but
all
the
printed
matter
he
could
find
consisted
of
a
few
words
on
and
an
advertisement
on
the
back
of
a
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
for
him
to
do
he
had
rested
he
did
not
want
to
lie
down
any
more
he
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
and
as
he
walked
he
fell
into
the
lately
acquired
habit
of
brooding
over
his
misfortune
suddenly
he
straightened
up
with
a
jerk
unconsciously
he
had
drawn
his
gun
standing
there
with
the
bright
cold
weapon
in
his
hand
he
looked
at
it
in
consternation
how
had
he
come
to
draw
it
with
difficulty
he
traced
his
thoughts
backward
but
could
not
find
any
that
was
accountable
for
his
act
he
discovered
however
that
he
had
a
remarkable
tendency
to
drop
his
hand
to
his
gun
that
might
have
come
from
the
habit
long
practice
in
drawing
had
given
him
likewise
it
might
have
come
from
a
subtle
sense
scarcely
thought
of
at
all
of
the
late
close
and
inevitable
relation
between
that
weapon
and
himself
he
was
amazed
to
find
that
bitter
as
he
had
grown
at
fate
the
desire
to
live
burned
strong
in
him
if
he
had
been
as
unfortunately
situated
but
with
the
difference
that
no
man
wanted
to
put
him
in
jail
or
take
his
life
he
felt
that
this
burning
passion
to
be
free
to
save
himself
might
not
have
been
so
powerful
life
certainly
held
no
bright
prospects
for
him
already
he
had
begun
to
despair
of
ever
getting
back
to
his
home
but
to
give
up
like
a
coward
to
let
himself
be
handcuffed
and
jailed
to
run
from
a
drunken
bragging
cowboy
or
be
shot
in
cold
blood
by
some
border
brute
who
merely
wanted
to
add
another
notch
to
his
gun
these
things
were
impossible
for
duane
because
there
was
in
him
the
temper
to
fight
in
that
hour
he
yielded
only
to
fate
and
the
spirit
inborn
in
him
hereafter
this
gun
must
be
a
living
part
of
him
right
then
and
there
he
returned
to
a
practice
he
had
long
discontinued
the
draw
it
was
now
a
stern
bitter
deadly
business
with
him
he
did
not
need
to
fire
the
gun
for
accuracy
was
a
gift
and
had
become
assured
swiftness
on
the
draw
however
could
be
improved
and
he
set
himself
to
acquire
the
limit
of
speed
possible
to
any
man
he
stood
still
in
his
tracks
he
paced
the
room
he
sat
down
lay
down
put
himself
in
awkward
positions
and
from
every
position
he
practiced
throwing
his
gun
practiced
it
till
he
was
hot
and
tired
and
his
arm
ached
and
his
hand
burned
that
practice
he
determined
to
keep
up
every
day
it
was
one
thing
at
least
that
would
help
pass
the
weary
hours
later
he
went
outdoors
to
the
cooler
shade
of
the
cottonwoods
from
this
point
he
could
see
a
good
deal
of
the
valley
under
different
circumstances
duane
felt
that
he
would
have
enjoyed
such
a
beautiful
spot
euchre
shack
sat
against
the
first
rise
of
the
slope
of
the
wall
and
duane
by
climbing
a
few
rods
got
a
view
of
the
whole
valley
assuredly
it
was
an
outlaw
settle
meet
he
saw
a
good
many
mexicans
who
of
course
were
hand
and
glove
with
bland
also
he
saw
enormous
crude
of
structure
moored
along
the
banks
of
the
river
the
rio
grande
rolled
away
between
high
bluffs
a
cable
sagging
deep
in
the
middle
was
stretched
over
the
wide
yellow
stream
and
an
old
scow
evidently
used
as
a
ferry
lay
anchored
on
the
far
shore
the
valley
was
an
ideal
retreat
for
an
outlaw
band
operating
on
a
big
scale
pursuit
scarcely
need
be
feared
over
the
broken
trails
of
the
rim
rock
and
the
open
end
of
the
valley
could
be
defended
against
almost
any
number
of
men
coming
down
the
river
access
to
mexico
was
easy
and
quick
what
puzzled
duane
was
how
bland
got
cattle
down
to
the
river
and
he
wondered
if
the
rustler
really
did
get
rid
of
his
stolen
stock
by
use
of
boats
duane
must
have
idled
considerable
time
up
on
the
hill
for
when
he
returned
to
the
shack
euchre
was
busily
engaged
around
the
glad
to
see
you
ai
so
pale
about
the
gills
as
you
was
he
said
by
way
of
greeting
in
an
we
soon
have
grub
ready
there
shore
one
consolin
fact
round
this
here
that
asked
duane
of
good
juicy
beef
to
eat
an
it
does
cost
a
short
it
costs
hard
rides
and
trouble
bad
conscience
and
life
too
does
it
ai
shore
about
the
bad
conscience
mine
never
bothered
me
none
an
as
for
life
why
thet
cheap
in
is
bland
asked
duane
quickly
changing
the
subject
do
you
know
about
him
do
know
who
he
is
or
where
he
hails
from
replied
euchre
always
been
somethin
to
interest
the
gang
he
must
have
been
a
young
man
when
he
struck
texas
now
he
i
remember
how
years
ago
he
was
an
not
rough
in
talk
or
act
like
he
is
now
bland
ai
likely
his
right
name
he
knows
a
lot
he
can
doctor
you
an
he
shore
a
knowin
feller
with
tools
he
the
kind
thet
rules
men
outlaws
are
always
ridin
in
here
to
join
his
gang
an
if
it
had
been
fer
the
gamblin
an
he
have
a
thousand
men
around
many
in
his
gang
now
reckon
there
short
of
a
hundred
now
the
number
varies
then
bland
has
several
small
camps
up
an
down
the
river
also
he
has
men
back
on
the
does
he
control
such
a
big
force
asked
duane
when
his
band
composed
of
bad
men
luke
stevens
said
he
had
no
use
for
bland
and
i
heard
once
somewhere
that
bland
was
a
it
he
is
a
devil
he
as
hard
as
flint
violent
in
temper
never
made
any
friends
except
his
men
dave
rugg
an
chess
alloway
bland
shoot
at
a
wink
he
killed
a
lot
of
fellers
some
fer
nothin
the
reason
thet
outlaws
gather
round
him
an
stick
is
because
he
a
safe
refuge
an
then
he
well
heeled
bland
is
rich
they
say
he
has
a
hundred
thousand
pesos
hid
somewhere
an
lots
of
gold
but
he
free
with
money
he
gambles
when
he
not
off
with
a
shipment
of
cattle
he
throws
money
around
an
the
fact
is
always
plenty
of
money
where
he
is
thet
what
holds
the
gang
dirty
bloody
money
a
wonder
he
has
been
killed
all
these
years
on
the
border
exclaimed
duane
replied
euchre
dryly
been
quicker
on
the
draw
than
the
other
fellers
who
hankered
to
kill
him
thet
euchre
reply
rather
chilled
duane
interest
for
the
moment
such
remarks
always
made
his
mind
revolve
round
facts
pertaining
to
himself
of
this
here
swift
wrist
game
went
on
euchre

considerable
talk
in

about

like
the
references
made
about
your

bland
was
honest
in
it
but
he
did
like
it
neither
some
of
the
fellers
allowed
your
draw
might
have
been
just
accident
but
most
of
them
figgered
different
an
they
all
shut
up
when
bland
told
who

what
your
dad
was
to
me
i
once
seen
your
dad
in
a
gunscrape
over
at

gave

was
rolling
a
slap
with
his
hand
manifestly
he
had
proclaimed
himself
a
champion
and
partner
of
duane
with
all
the
pride
an
old
man
could
feel
in
a
young
one
whom

likin
to

eat
now
an
afterward
we
go
out
so
the
gang
can
see
you
not
when
duane
went
out
with
euchre
the
sun
was
setting
behind
a
blue
range
of
mountains
across
the
river
in
mexico
the
valley
appeared
to
open
to
the
southwest
it
was
a
tranquil
beautiful
scene
somewhere
in
a
house
near
at
hand
a
woman
was
singing
and
in
the
road
duane
saw
a
little
mexican
boy
driving
home
some
cows
one
of
which
wore
a
bell
the
sweet
happy
voice
of
a
woman
and
a
whistling
barefoot
boy
these
seemed
utterly
out
of
place
here
euchre
presently
led
to
the
square
and
the
row
of
rough
houses
duane
remembered
he
almost
stepped
on
a
wide
imprint
in
the
dust
where
bosomer
had
confronted
him
and
a
sudden
fury
beset
him
that
he
should
be
affected
strangely
by
the
sight
of
it
have
a
look
in
here
said
euchre
duane
had
to
bend
his
head
to
enter
the
door
he
found
himself
in
a
very
large
room
inclosed
by
adobe
walls
and
roofed
with
brush
it
was
full
of
rude
benches
tables
seats
at
one
corner
a
number
of
kegs
and
barrels
lay
side
by
side
in
a
rack
a
mexican
boy
was
lighting
lamps
hung
on
posts
that
sustained
the
log
rafters
of
the
roof
only
feller
who
goin
to
put
a
close
eye
on
you
is
benson
said
euchre
runs
the
place
an
sells
drinks
the
gang
calls
him
jackrabbit
benson
because
he
always
got
his
eye
peeled
an
his
ear
cocked
do
notice
him
if
he
looks
you
over
buck
benson
is
scared
to
death
of
every
who
rustles
into
bland
camp
an
the
reason
i
take
it
is
because
he
done
somebody
dirt
he
hidin
not
from
a
sheriff
or
ranger
men
who
hide
from
them
do
act
like
jackrabbit
benson
he
hidin
from
some
guy
who
huntin
him
to
kill
him
wal
i
always
expectin
to
see
some
feller
ride
in
here
an
throw
a
gun
on
benson
ca
say
i
be
duane
casually
glanced
in
the
direction
indicated
and
he
saw
a
spare
gaunt
man
with
a
face
strikingly
white
beside
the
red
and
bronze
and
dark
skins
of
the
men
around
him
it
was
a
cadaverous
face
the
black
mustache
hung
down
a
heavy
lock
of
black
hair
dropped
down
over
the
brow
hollow
staring
eyes
looked
out
piercingly
the
man
had
a
restless
alert
nervous
manner
he
put
his
hands
on
the
board
that
served
as
a
bar
and
stared
at
duane
but
when
he
met
duane
glance
he
turned
hurriedly
to
go
on
serving
out
liquor
have
you
got
against
him
inquired
duane
as
he
sat
down
beside
euchre
he
asked
more
for
something
to
say
than
from
real
interest
what
did
he
care
about
a
mean
haunted
criminal
mebbe
i
replied
euchre
apologetically
an
outlaw
an
rustler
such
as
me
ca
be
touchy
but
i
never
stole
nothin
but
cattle
from
some
rancher
who
never
missed
anyway
thet
sneak
benson
he
was
the
means
of
puttin
a
little
girl
in
bland
queried
duane
now
with
real
attention
bland
great
on
women
i
tell
you
about
this
girl
when
we
get
out
of
here
some
of
the
gang
are
goin
to
be
sociable
an
i
talk
about
the
during
the
ensuing
a
number
of
outlaws
passed
by
duane
and
euchre
halted
for
a
greeting
or
sat
down
for
a
moment
they
were
all
gruff
merry
and
duane
replied
civilly
and
agreeably
when
he
was
personally
addressed
but
he
refused
all
invitations
to
drink
and
gamble
evidently
he
had
been
accepted
in
a
way
as
one
of
their
clan
no
one
made
any
hint
of
an
allusion
to
his
affair
with
bosomer
duane
saw
readily
that
euchre
was
well
liked
one
outlaw
borrowed
money
from
him
another
asked
for
tobacco
by
the
time
it
was
dark
the
big
room
was
full
of
outlaws
and
mexicans
most
of
whom
were
engaged
at
monte
these
gamblers
especially
the
mexicans
were
intense
and
quiet
the
noise
in
the
place
came
from
the
drinkers
the
loungers
duane
had
seen
some
of
the
famous
ones
in
san
antonio
and
el
paso
a
few
in
border
towns
where
license
went
unchecked
but
this
place
of
jackrabbit
benson
impressed
him
as
one
where
guns
and
knives
were
accessories
to
the
game
to
his
perhaps
rather
distinguishing
eye
the
most
prominent
thing
about
the
gamesters
appeared
to
be
their
weapons
on
several
of
the
tables
were
piles
of
silver
mexican
pesos
as
large
and
high
as
the
crown
of
his
hat
there
were
also
piles
of
gold
and
silver
in
united
states
coin
duane
needed
no
experienced
eyes
to
see
that
betting
was
heavy
and
that
heavy
sums
exchanged
hands
the
mexicans
showed
a
sterner
obsession
an
intenser
passion
some
of
the
americans
staked
freely
nonchalantly
as
befitted
men
to
whom
money
was
nothing
these
latter
were
manifestly
winning
for
there
were
brother
outlaws
there
who
wagered
coin
with
grudging
sullen
greedy
eyes
boisterous
talk
and
laughter
among
the
drinking
men
drowned
except
at
intervals
the
low
brief
talk
of
the
gamblers
the
clink
of
coin
sounded
incessantly
sometimes
just
low
steady
musical
rings
and
again
when
a
pile
was
tumbled
quickly
there
was
a
silvery
crash
here
an
outlaw
pounded
on
a
table
with
the
butt
of
his
gun
there
another
noisily
palmed
a
roll
of
dollars
while
he
studied
his
opponent
face
the
noises
however
in
benson
den
did
not
contribute
to
any
extent
to
the
sinister
aspect
of
the
place
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
grim
and
reckless
faces
from
the
bent
intent
heads
from
the
dark
lights
and
shades
there
were
bright
lights
but
these
served
only
to
make
the
shadows
and
in
the
shadows
lurked
unrestrained
lust
of
gain
a
spirit
ruthless
and
reckless
a
something
at
once
suggesting
lawlessness
theft
murder
and
hell
not
here
euchre
was
saying
left
today
on
one
of
his
trips

he
killed
his
sweetheart
father
got
run
out
of
staceytown
took
to
stealin
hosses
an
next
he
here
with
bland
another
boy
gone
wrong
an
now
shore
a
hard
euchre
went
on
calling
duane
attention
to
other
men
just
as
he
happened
to
glance
over
them
any
one
of
them
would
have
been
a
marked
man
in
a
respectable
crowd
here
each
took
his
place
with
more
or
less
distinction
according
to
the
record
of
his
past
wild
prowess
and
his
present
possibilities
duane
realizing
that
he
was
tolerated
there
received
in
careless
friendly
spirit
by
this
terrible
class
of
outcasts
experienced
a
feeling
of
revulsion
that
amounted
almost
to
horror
was
his
being
there
not
an
ugly
dream
what
had
he
in
common
with
such
ruffians
then
in
a
flash
of
memory
came
the
painful
proof
he
was
a
criminal
in
sight
of
texas
law
he
too
was
an
outcast
for
the
moment
duane
was
wrapped
up
in
painful
reflections
but
heavy
hand
clapping
with
a
warning
hold
on
his
arm
brought
him
back
to
outside
things
the
hum
of
voices
the
clink
of
coin
the
loud
laughter
had
ceased
there
was
a
silence
that
manifestly
had
followed
some
unusual
word
or
action
sufficient
to
still
the
room
it
was
broken
by
a
harsh
curse
and
the
scrape
of
a
bench
on
the
floor
some
man
had
risen
stacked
the
cards
you
that
twice
another
voice
replied
so
different
in
its
cool
ominous
tone
from
the
other
say
it
twice
returned
the
first
gamester
in
hot
haste
say
it
three
times
i
whistle
it
are
you
deaf
you
gent
you
stacked
the
cards
silence
ensued
deeper
than
before
pregnant
with
meaning
for
all
that
duane
saw
not
an
outlaw
moved
for
a
full
moment
then
suddenly
the
room
was
full
of
disorder
as
men
rose
and
ran
and
dived
everywhere
or
duck
yelled
euchre
close
to
duane
ear
with
that
he
dashed
for
the
door
duane
leaped
after
him
they
ran
into
a
jostling
mob
heavy
and
hoarse
yells
hurried
the
crowd
duane
was
with
out
into
the
darkness
there
they
all
halted
and
several
peeped
in
at
the
door
was
the
kid
callin
asked
one
outlaw
marsh
replied
another
reckon
them
fust
shots
was
bud
adios
kid
it
was
comin
to
him
went
on
yet
another
many
shots
or
four
i
heavy
an
one
light
thet
light
one
was
the
listen
there
the
kid
hollerin
now
he
ai
cashed
at
this
juncture
most
of
the
outlaws
began
to
file
back
into
the
room
duane
thought
he
had
seen
and
heard
enough
in
benson
den
for
one
night
and
he
started
slowly
down
the
walk
presently
euchre
caught
up
with
him
hurt
much
which
shore
some
strange
he
said
kid
young
fuller
thet
i
was
tellin
you
about
he
was
drinkin
an
losin
lost
his
nut
too
callin
bud
marsh
thet
way
bud
as
straight
at
cards
as
any
of
somebody
grabbed
bud
who
shot
into
the
roof
an
arm
was
knocked
up
he
only
hit
a
chapter
vi
next
morning
duane
found
that
a
moody
and
despondent
spell
had
fastened
on
him
wishing
to
be
alone
he
went
out
and
walked
a
trail
leading
round
the
river
bluff
he
thought
and
thought
after
a
while
he
made
out
that
the
trouble
with
him
probably
was
that
he
could
not
resign
himself
to
his
fate
he
abhorred
the
possibility
chance
seemed
to
hold
in
store
for
him
he
could
not
believe
there
was
no
hope
but
what
to
do
appeared
beyond
his
power
to
tell
duane
had
intelligence
and
keenness
enough
to
see
his
peril
the
danger
threatening
his
character
as
a
man
just
as
much
as
that
which
threatened
his
life
he
cared
vastly
more
he
discovered
for
what
he
considered
honor
and
integrity
than
he
did
for
life
he
saw
that
it
was
bad
for
him
to
be
alone
but
it
appeared
lonely
months
and
perhaps
years
inevitably
must
be
his
another
thing
puzzled
him
in
the
bright
light
of
day
he
could
not
recall
the
state
of
mind
that
was
his
at
twilight
or
dusk
or
in
the
dark
night
by
day
these
visitations
became
to
him
what
they
really
were
phantoms
of
his
conscience
he
could
dismiss
the
thought
of
them
then
he
could
scarcely
remember
or
believe
that
this
strange
feat
of
fancy
or
imagination
had
troubled
him
pained
him
made
him
sleepless
and
sick
that
morning
duane
spent
an
unhappy
hour
wrestling
decision
out
of
the
unstable
condition
of
his
mind
but
at
length
he
determined
to
create
interest
in
all
that
he
came
across
and
so
forget
himself
as
much
as
possible
he
had
an
opportunity
now
to
see
just
what
the
life
really
was
he
meant
to
force
himself
to
be
curious
sympathetic
and
he
would
stay
there
in
the
valley
until
its
possibilities
had
been
exhausted
or
until
circumstances
sent
him
out
upon
his
uncertain
way
when
he
returned
to
the
shack
euchre
was
cooking
dinner
buck
i
news
for
you
he
said
and
his
tone
conveyed
either
pride
in
his
possession
of
such
news
or
pride
in
duane
named
bradley
rode
in
this
mornin
he
heard
some
about
you
told
about
the
ace
of
spades
they
put
over
the
bullet
holes
in
thet
cowpuncher
bain
you
plugged
then
there
was
a
rancher
shot
at
a
twenty
miles
south
of
wellston
reckon
you
did
do
it
i
certainly
did
not
replied
duane
you
get
the
blame
it
ai
nothin
for
a
feller
to
be
saddled
with
he
never
made
an
buck
if
you
ever
get
famous
as
seems
likely
you
be
blamed
for
many
a
crime
the
border
make
an
outlaw
an
murderer
out
of
you
wal
thet
enough
of
thet
i
more
news

to
be
what

mornin

when
you
rode
in
she
shore

some
of
the
other
women
in
camp
they
always
want
to
meet
the
new
fellers
who
just
come
in
it
lonesome
for
women
here
an
they
like
to
hear
news
from
the
euchre
i
do
want
to
be
impolite
but
i
rather
not
meet
any
women
rejoined
duane
was
afraid
you
would
do
blame
you
much
women
are
hell
i
was
hopin
though
you
might
talk
a
little
to
thet
poor
lonesome
kid
inquired
duane
in
surprise
i
tell
you
about
jennie
the
girl
bland
holdin
here
the
one
jackrabbit
benson
had
a
hand
in
stealin
mentioned
a
girl
that
all
tell
me
now
replied
duane
abruptly
i
got
it
this
way
mebbe
it
straight
an
mebbe
it
ai
some
years
ago
benson
made
a
trip
over
the
river
to
buy
mescal
an
other
drinks
he
sneak
over
there
once
in
a
while
an
as
i
get
it
he
run
across
a
gang
of
greasers
with
some
gringo
prisoners
i
do
know
but
i
reckon
there
was
some
barterin
perhaps
murderin
anyway
benson
fetched
the
girl
back
she
was
more
dead
than
alive
but
it
turned
out
she
was
only
starved
an
scared
half
to
death
she
had
been
harmed
i
reckon
she
was
then
about
fourteen
years
old
benson
idee
he
said
was
to
use
her
in
his
den
sellin
drinks
an
the
like
but
i
never
went
much
on
jackrabbit
word
bland
seen
the
kid
right
off
and
took
her
bought
her
from
benson
you
can
gamble
bland
did
do
thet
from
notions
of
chivalry
i
ai
gainsayin
however
but
thet
jennie
was
better
off
with
kate
bland
she
been
hard
on
jennie
but
she
kept
bland
an
the
other

euchre

replied
duane
he
felt
euchre
eyes
upon
him
the
old
outlaw
however
had
no
more
to
say
in
the
afternoon
euchre
set
off
with
duane
and
soon
they
reached
bland
cabin
duane
remembered
it
as
the
one
where
he
had
seen
the
pretty
woman
watching
him
ride
by
he
could
not
recall
what
she
looked
like
the
cabin
was
the
same
as
the
other
adobe
structures
in
the
valley
but
it
was
larger
and
pleasantly
located
rather
high
up
in
a
grove
of
cottonwoods
in
the
windows
and
upon
the
porch
were
evidences
of
a
woman
hand
through
the
open
door
duane
caught
a
glimpse
of
bright
mexican
blankets
and
rugs
euchre
knocked
upon
the
side
of
the
door
that
you
euchre
asked
a
girl
voice
low
hesitatingly
the
tone
of
it
rather
deep
and
with
a
note
of
fear
struck
duane
he
wondered
what
she
would
be
like
it
me
jennie
where
mrs
bland
answered
euchre
went
over
to
deger
there
somebody
sick
replied
the
girl
euchre
turned
and
whispered
something
about
luck
the
snap
of
the
outlaw
eyes
was
added
significance
to
duane
come
out
or
let
us
come
in
here
the
young
man
i
was
you
about
euchre
said
i
ca
i
look
so
so
mind
how
you
look
interrupted
the
outlaw
in
a
whisper
ai
no
time
to
care
fer
thet
here
young
duane
jennie
he
no
rustler
no
thief
he
different
come
out
jennie
an
mebbe
he
euchre
did
not
complete
his
sentence
he
had
spoken
low
with
his
glance
shifting
from
side
to
side
but
what
he
said
was
sufficient
to
bring
the
girl
quickly
she
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
downcast
eyes
and
a
stain
of
red
in
her
white
cheek
she
had
a
pretty
sad
face
and
bright
hair
be
bashful
jennie
said
euchre
an
duane
have
a
chance
to
talk
a
little
now
i
go
fetch
mrs
bland
but
i
wo
be
with
that
euchre
went
away
through
the
cottonwoods
glad
to
meet
you
miss
miss
jennie
said
duane
mention
your
last
name
he
asked
me
to
come
over
to
duane
attempt
at
pleasantry
halted
short
when
jennie
lifted
her
lashes
to
look
at
him
some
kind
of
a
shock
went
through
duane
her
gray
eyes
were
beautiful
but
it
had
not
been
beauty
that
cut
short
his
speech
he
seemed
to
see
a
tragic
struggle
between
hope
and
doubt
that
shone
in
her
piercing
gaze
she
kept
looking
and
duane
could
not
break
the
silence
it
was
no
ordinary
moment
did
you
come
here
for
she
asked
at
last
see
you
replied
duane
glad
to
speak
euchre
thought
he
wanted
me
to
talk
to
you
cheer
you
up
a
bit
replied
duane
somewhat
lamely
the
earnest
eyes
embarrassed
him
good
he
the
only
person
in
this
awful
place
who
been
good
to
me
but
he
afraid
of
bland
he
said
you
were
different
who
are
you
duane
told
her
not
a
robber
or
rustler
or
murderer
or
some
bad
man
come
here
to
hide
i
not
replied
duane
trying
to
smile
why
are
you
here
on
the
dodge
you
know
what
that
means
i
got
in
a
at
home
and
had
to
run
off
when
it
blows
over
i
hope
to
go
you
ca
be
honest
here
i
i
know
what
these
outlaws
are
yes
you
she
kept
the
strained
gaze
upon
him
but
hope
was
kindling
and
the
hard
lines
of
her
youthful
face
were
softening
something
sweet
and
warm
stirred
deep
in
duane
as
he
realized
the
unfortunate
girl
was
experiencing
a
birth
of
trust
in
him
god
maybe
you
the
man
to
save
me
to
take
me
away
before
it
too
duane
spirit
leaped
i
am
he
replied
instantly
she
seemed
to
check
a
blind
impulse
to
run
into
his
arms
her
cheek
flamed
her
lips
quivered
her
bosom
swelled
under
her
ragged
dress
then
the
glow
began
to
fade
doubt
once
more
assailed
her
ca
be
you
only
after
me
too
like
bland
like
all
of
duane
long
arms
went
out
and
his
hands
clasped
her
shoulders
he
shook
her
at
me
straight
in
the
eye
there
are
decent
men
have
you
a
father
a
brother
dead
killed
by
raiders
we
lived
in
dimmit
county
i
was
carried
away
jennie
replied
hurriedly
she
put
up
an
appealing
hand
to
him
me
i
believe
i
know
you
good
it
was
only
i
live
so
much
in
fear
i
half
crazy
i
almost
forgotten
what
good
men
are
like
mister
duane
you
help
me
jennie
i
will
tell
me
how
what
must
i
do
have
you
any
plan
no
but
take
me
try
said
duane
simply
wo
be
easy
though
i
must
have
time
to
think
you
must
help
me
there
are
many
things
to
consider
horses
food
trails
and
then
the
best
time
to
make
the
attempt
are
you
watched
kept
prisoner
i
could
have
run
off
lots
of
times
but
i
was
afraid
i
only
have
fallen
into
worse
hands
euchre
has
told
me
that
mrs
bland
beats
me
half
starves
me
but
she
has
kept
me
from
her
husband
and
these
other
dogs
she
been
as
good
as
that
and
i
grateful
she
has
done
it
for
love
of
me
though
she
always
hated
me
and
lately
she
growing
jealous
there
was
a
man
came
here
by
the
name
of
spence
so
he
called
himself
he
tried
to
be
kind
to
me
but
she
would
let
him
she
was
in
love
with
him
she
a
bad
woman
bland
finally
shot
spence
and
that
ended
that
she
been
jealous
ever
since
i
hear
her
fighting
with
bland
about
me
she
swears
she
kill
me
before
he
gets
me
and
bland
laughs
in
her
face
then
i
heard
chess
alloway
try
to
persuade
bland
to
give
me
to
him
but
bland
does
laugh
then
just
lately
before
bland
went
away
things
almost
came
to
a
head
i
could
sleep
i
wished
mrs
bland
would
kill
me
i
certainly
kill
myself
if
they
ruin
me
duane
you
must
be
quick
if
you
save
realize
that
replied
he
thoughtfully
think
my
difficulty
will
be
to
fool
mrs
bland
if
she
suspected
me
she
have
the
whole
gang
of
outlaws
on
me
at
would
that
you
got
to
be
careful
and
kind
of
woman
is
she
inquired
duane
she
brazen
i
heard
her
with
her
lovers
they
get
drunk
sometimes
when
bland
away
she
got
a
terrible
temper
she
vain
she
likes
flattery
oh
you
could
fool
her
easy
enough
if
you
lower
yourself
to
to
make
love
to
her
interrupted
duane
jennie
bravely
turned
shamed
eyes
to
meet
his
girl
i
do
worse
than
that
to
get
you
away
from
here
he
said
bluntly
duane
she
faltered
and
again
she
put
out
the
appealing
hand
will
kill
duane
made
no
reply
to
this
he
was
trying
to
still
a
rising
strange
tumult
in
his
breast
the
old
emotion
the
rush
of
an
instinct
to
kill
he
turned
cold
all
over
alloway
will
kill
you
if
bland
does
went
on
jennie
with
her
tragic
eyes
on
duane
he
will
replied
duane
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
force
a
smile
but
he
achieved
one
better
take
me
off
at
once
she
said
me
without
risking
so
much
without
making
love
to
mrs
bland
if
i
can
there
i
see
euchre
coming
with
a
her
oh
she
must
see
me
with
a
moment
whispered
duane
as
jennie
slipped
indoors
settled
it
do
forget
i
find
some
way
to
get
word
to
you
perhaps
through
euchre
meanwhile
keep
up
your
courage
remember
i
save
you
somehow
we
try
strategy
first
whatever
you
see
or
hear
me
do
think
less
of
me
jennie
checked
him
with
a
gesture
and
a
wonderful
gray
flash
of
eyes
bless
you
with
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
heart
she
whispered
passionately
it
was
only
as
she
turned
away
into
the
room
that
duane
saw
she
was
lame
and
that
she
wore
mexican
sandals
over
bare
feet
he
sat
down
upon
a
bench
on
the
porch
and
directed
his
attention
to
the
approaching
couple
the
trees
of
the
grove
were
thick
enough
for
him
to
make
reasonably
sure
that
mrs
bland
had
not
seen
him
talking
to
jennie
when
the
outlaw
wife
drew
near
duane
saw
that
she
was
a
tall
strong
woman
rather
with
a
fullblown
bold
attractiveness
duane
was
more
concerned
with
her
expression
than
with
her
good
looks
and
as
she
appeared
unsuspicious
he
felt
relieved
the
situation
then
took
on
a
singular
zest
euchre
came
up
on
the
porch
and
awkwardly
introduced
duane
to
mrs
bland
she
was
young
probably
not
over
and
not
quite
so
prepossessing
at
close
range
her
eyes
were
large
rather
prominent
and
brown
in
color
her
mouth
too
was
large
with
the
lips
full
and
she
had
white
teeth
duane
took
her
proffered
hand
and
remarked
frankly
that
he
was
glad
to
meet
her
mrs
bland
appeared
pleased
and
her
laugh
which
followed
was
loud
and
rather
musical
duane
buck
duane
euchre
said
did
he
she
asked
corrected
duane
nickname
not
of
my
certainly
glad
to
meet
you
buckley
duane
she
said
as
she
took
the
seat
duane
offered
her
to
have
been
out
kid
fuller
lying
over
at
deger
you
know
he
was
shot
last
night
he
got
fever
when
bland
away
i
have
to
nurse
all
these
boys
and
it
sure
takes
my
time
have
you
been
waiting
here
alone
did
see
that
slattern
girl
of
mine
she
gave
him
a
sharp
glance
the
woman
had
an
extraordinary
play
of
feature
duane
thought
and
unless
she
was
smiling
was
not
pretty
at
all
been
alone
replied
duane
seen
anybody
but
a
girl
with
a
bucket
and
she
ran
when
she
saw
was
jen
said
mrs
bland
the
kid
we
keep
here
and
she
sure
hardly
pays
her
keep
did
euchre
tell
you
about
her
that
i
think
of
it
he
did
say
something
or
did
he
tell
you
about
me
bluntly
asked
mrs
bland
kate
replied
euchre
speaking
for
himself
need
worry
none
for
i
told
buck
nothin
but
evidently
the
outlaw
wife
liked
euchre
for
her
keen
glance
rested
with
amusement
upon
him
for
jen
i
tell
you
her
story
some
day
went
on
the
woman
a
common
enough
story
along
this
river
euchre
here
is
a
old
fool
and
jen
has
taken
him
seein
as
you
got
me
figgered
correct
replied
euchre
dryly
go
in
an
talk
to
jennie
if
i
go
ahead
jen
calls
you
her
best
friend
said
mrs
bland
amiably
always
fetching
some
mexican
stuff
and
that
why
i
when
euchre
had
shuffled
into
the
house
mrs
bland
turned
to
duane
with
curiosity
and
interest
in
her
gaze
told
me
about
did
he
say
queried
duane
in
pretended
alarm
you
need
think
he
done
you
dirt
bland
not
that
kind
of
a
man
he
said
there
a
young
fellow
in
camp
rode
in
here
on
the
dodge
he
no
criminal
and
he
refused
to
join
my
band
wish
he
would
slickest
hand
with
a
gun
i
seen
for
many
a
day
i
like
to
see
him
and
chess
meet
out
there
in
the
road
then
bland
went
on
to
tell
how
you
and
bosomer
came
did
you
say
inquired
duane
as
she
paused
why
i
asked
him
what
you
looked
like
she
replied
gayly
went
on
duane
chap
bland
said
bigger
than
any
man
in
the
valley
just
a
great
sunburned
boy
exclaimed
duane
sorry
he
led
you
to
expect
somebody
worth
i
not
disappointed
she
returned
archly
are
you
going
to
stay
long
here
in
camp
till
i
run
out
of
money
and
have
to
move
why
mrs
bland
face
underwent
one
of
the
singular
changes
the
smiles
and
flushes
and
glances
all
that
had
been
coquettish
about
her
had
lent
her
a
certain
attractiveness
almost
beauty
and
youth
but
with
some
powerful
emotion
she
changed
and
instantly
became
a
woman
of
discontent
duane
imagined
of
deep
violent
nature
tell
you
duane
she
said
earnestly
sure
glad
if
you
mean
to
bide
here
awhile
i
a
miserable
woman
duane
i
an
outlaw
wife
and
i
hate
him
and
the
life
i
have
to
lead
i
come
of
a
good
family
in
brownsville
i
never
knew
bland
was
an
outlaw
till
long
after
he
married
me
we
were
separated
at
times
and
i
imagined
he
was
away
on
business
but
the
truth
came
out
bland
shot
my
own
cousin
who
told
me
my
family
cast
me
off
and
i
had
to
flee
with
bland
i
was
only
eighteen
then
i
lived
here
since
i
never
see
a
decent
woman
or
man
i
never
hear
anything
about
my
old
home
or
folks
or
friends
i
buried
here
buried
alive
with
a
lot
of
thieves
and
murderers
can
you
blame
me
for
being
glad
to
see
a
young
fellow
a
gentleman
like
the
boys
i
used
to
go
with
i
tell
you
it
makes
me
feel
full
i
want
to
cry
i
sick
for
somebody
to
talk
to
i
have
no
children
thank
god
if
i
had
i
not
stay
here
i
sick
of
this
hole
i
lonely
there
appeared
to
be
no
doubt
about
the
truth
of
all
this
genuine
emotion
checked
then
halted
the
hurried
speech
she
broke
down
and
cried
it
seemed
strange
to
duane
that
an
outlaw
wife
and
a
woman
who
fitted
her
consort
and
the
wild
nature
of
their
surroundings
should
have
weakness
enough
to
weep
duane
believed
and
pitied
her
sorry
for
you
he
said
be
sorry
for
me
she
said
only
makes
me
see
the
the
difference
between
you
and
me
and
do
pay
any
attention
to
what
these
outlaws
say
about
me
they
ignorant
they
could
understand
me
you
hear
that
bland
killed
men
who
ran
after
me
but
that
a
lie
bland
like
all
the
other
outlaws
along
this
river
is
always
looking
for
somebody
to
kill
he
swears
not
but
i
do
believe
him
he
explains
that
gunplay
gravitates
to
men
who
are
the
real
thing
that
it
is
provoked
by
the
the
bad
men
i
do
know
all
i
know
is
that
somebody
is
being
killed
every
other
day
he
hated
spence
before
spence
ever
saw
bland
object
if
i
called
on
you
occasionally
inquired
duane
he
would
he
likes
me
to
have
friends
ask
him
yourself
when
he
comes
back
the
trouble
has
been
that
two
or
three
of
his
men
fell
in
love
with
me
and
when
half
drunk
got
to
fighting
you
not
going
to
do
not
going
to
get
half
drunk
that
certain
replied
duane
he
was
surprised
to
see
her
eyes
dilate
then
glow
with
fire
before
she
could
reply
euchre
returned
to
the
porch
and
that
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
duane
was
content
to
let
the
matter
rest
there
and
had
little
more
to
say
euchre
and
mrs
bland
talked
and
joked
while
duane
listened
he
tried
to
form
some
estimate
of
her
character
manifestly
she
had
suffered
a
wrong
if
not
worse
at
bland
hands
she
was
bitter
morbid
overemotional
if
she
was
a
liar
which
seemed
likely
enough
she
was
a
frank
one
and
believed
herself
she
had
no
cunning
the
thing
which
struck
duane
so
forcibly
was
that
she
thirsted
for
respect
in
that
better
than
in
her
weakness
of
vanity
he
thought
he
had
discovered
a
trait
through
which
he
could
manage
her
once
while
he
was
revolving
these
thoughts
he
happened
to
glance
into
the
house
and
deep
in
the
shadow
of
a
corner
he
caught
a
pale
gleam
of
jennie
face
with
great
staring
eyes
on
him
she
had
been
watching
him
listening
to
what
he
said
he
saw
from
her
expression
that
she
had
realized
what
had
been
so
hard
for
her
to
believe
watching
his
chance
he
flashed
a
look
at
her
and
then
it
seemed
to
him
the
change
in
her
face
was
wonderful
later
after
he
had
left
mrs
bland
with
a
meaning
manana
and
was
walking
along
beside
the
old
outlaw
he
found
himself
thinking
of
the
girl
instead
of
the
woman
and
of
how
he
had
seen
her
face
blaze
with
hope
and
gratitude
chapter
vii
that
night
duane
was
not
troubled
by
ghosts
haunting
his
waking
and
sleeping
hours
he
awoke
feeling
bright
and
eager
and
grateful
to
euchre
for
having
put
something
worth
while
into
his
mind
during
breakfast
however
he
was
unusually
thoughtful
working
over
the
idea
of
how
much
or
how
little
he
would
confide
in
the
outlaw
he
was
aware
of
euchre
scrutiny
began
the
old
man
at
last
you
make
out
with
the
kid
inquired
duane
tentatively
i
mean
what
you
an
she
talk
about
had
a
little
chat
you
know
you
wanted
me
to
cheer
her
euchre
sat
with
poised
and
narrow
eyes
studying
duane
you
cheered
her
all
right
what
i
afeared
of
is
mebbe
you
done
the
job
too
so
when
i
went
in
to
jen
last
night
i
thought
she
was
half
crazy
she
was
burstin
with
excitement
an
the
look
in
her
eyes
hurt
me
she
would
tell
me
a
darn
word
you
said
but
she
hung
onto
my
hands
an
showed
every
way
without
speakin
how
she
wanted
to
thank
me
fer
bringin
you
over
buck
it
was
plain
to
me
thet
you
either
gone
the
limit
or
else
you
been
kinder
prodigal
of
cheer
an
hope
i
hate
to
think
you
led
jennie
to
hope
more
ever
would
come
euchre
paused
and
as
there
seemed
no
reply
forthcoming
he
went
on
i
seen
some
outlaws
whose
word
was
good
mine
is
you
can
trust
me
i
trusted
you
did
i
takin
you
over
there
an
puttin
you
wise
to
my
tryin
to
help
thet
poor
kid
thus
enjoined
by
euchre
duane
began
to
tell
the
conversations
with
jennie
and
mrs
bland
word
for
word
long
before
he
had
reached
an
end
euchre
set
down
the
and
began
to
stare
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
story
his
face
lost
some
of
its
red
color
and
beads
of
sweat
stood
out
thickly
on
his
brow
if
thet
does
floor
me
he
ejaculated
blinking
at
duane
man
i
figgered
you
was
some
swift
an
sure
to
make
your
mark
on
this
river
but
i
reckon
i
missed
your
real
caliber
so
thet
what
it
means
to
be
a
man
i
guess
i
forgot
wal
i
old
an
even
if
my
heart
was
in
the
right
place
i
never
was
built
fer
big
stunts
do
you
know
what
it
take
to
do
all
you
promised
jen
have
any
idea
replied
duane
gravely
have
to
pull
the
wool
over
kate
bland
eyes
ant
even
if
she
falls
in
love
with
you
which
shore
likely
thet
wo
be
easy
an
she
kill
you
in
a
minnit
buck
if
she
ever
got
wise
you
mistaken
her
none
are
you
me
euchre
she
a
woman
i
fear
her
more
than
any
you
have
to
kill
bland
an
chess
alloway
an
rugg
an
mebbe
some
others
before
you
can
ride
off
into
the
hills
with
thet
ca
we
plan
to
be
nice
to
mrs
bland
and
then
at
an
opportune
time
sneak
off
without
any
see
how
on
earth
returned
euchre
earnestly
away
he
leaves
all
kinds
of
spies
an
scouts
watchin
the
valley
trails
they
all
got
rifles
you
could
git
by
them
but
when
the
boss
is
home
there
a
difference
only
of
course
him
an
chess
keep
their
eyes
peeled
they
both
stay
to
home
pretty
much
except
when
playin
monte
or
poker
over
at
benson
so
i
say
the
best
bet
is
to
pick
out
a
good
time
in
the
afternoon
drift
over
with
a
couple
of
hosses
choke
mrs
bland
or
knock
her
on
the
head
take
jennie
with
you
an
make
a
rush
to
git
out
of
the
valley
if
you
had
luck
you
might
pull
thet
stunt
without
throwin
a
gun
but
i
reckon
the
best
figgerin
would
include
dodgin
some
lead
an
leavin
at
least
bland
or
alloway
dead
behind
you
i
figgerin
of
course
thet
when
they
come
home
an
find
out
you
visitin
kate
frequent
they
jest
naturally
look
fer
results
chess
do
like
you
fer
no
reason
except
swift
on
the
draw
mebbe
swifter
him
thet
the
hell
of
this
business
no
one
can
ever
tell
who
the
swifter
of
two
gunmen
till
they
meet
thet
fact
holds
a
fascination
mebbe
you
learn
some
day
bland
would
treat
you
civil
onless
there
was
reason
not
to
then
i
do
believe
he
invite
himself
to
a
meetin
with
you
he
set
chess
or
rugg
to
put
you
out
of
the
way
still
bland
no
coward
an
if
you
came
across
him
at
a
bad
moment
you
have
to
be
quicker
you
was
with
right
i
meet
what
comes
said
duane
quickly
great
point
is
to
have
horses
ready
and
pick
the
right
moment
then
rush
the
trick
the
only
chance
fer
success
an
you
ca
do
it
have
to
i
would
ask
you
to
help
me
leave
you
behind
i
take
my
chances
replied
euchre
gruffly
goin
to
help
jennie
you
can
gamble
your
last
peso
on
thet
there
only
four
men
in
this
camp
who
would
shoot
me
bland
an
his
pards
an
thet
benson
if
you
happened
to
put
out
bland
and
chess
stand
a
good
show
with
the
other
two
anyway
i
old
an
tired
the
difference
if
i
do
git
plugged
i
can
risk
as
much
as
you
buck
even
if
i
am
afraid
of
you
said
correct
ready
the
right
minnit
then
rush
the
trick
thet
much
settled
now
figger
all
the
little
they
talked
and
planned
though
in
truth
it
was
euchre
who
planned
duane
who
listened
and
agreed
while
awaiting
the
return
of
bland
and
his
lieutenants
it
would
be
well
for
duane
to
grow
friendly
with
the
other
outlaws
to
sit
in
a
few
games
of
monte
or
show
a
willingness
to
spend
a
little
money
the
two
schemers
were
to
call
upon
mrs
bland
every
day
euchre
to
carry
messages
of
cheer
and
warning
to
jennie
duane
to
blind
the
elder
woman
at
any
cost
these
preliminaries
decided
upon
they
proceeded
to
put
them
into
action
no
hard
task
was
it
to
win
the
friendship
of
the
most
of
those
outlaws
they
were
used
to
men
of
a
better
order
than
theirs
coming
to
the
hidden
camps
and
sooner
or
later
sinking
to
their
lower
level
besides
with
them
everything
was
easy
come
easy
go
that
was
why
life
itself
went
on
so
carelessly
and
usually
ended
so
cheaply
there
were
men
among
them
however
that
made
duane
feel
that
terrible
inexplicable
wrath
rise
in
his
breast
he
could
not
bear
to
be
near
them
he
could
not
trust
himself
he
felt
that
any
instant
a
word
a
deed
something
might
call
too
deeply
to
that
instinct
he
could
no
longer
control
jackrabbit
benson
was
one
of
these
men
because
of
him
and
other
outlaws
of
his
ilk
duane
could
scarcely
ever
forget
the
reality
of
things
this
was
a
hidden
valley
a
robbers
den
a
rendezvous
for
murderers
a
wild
place
stained
red
by
deeds
of
wild
men
and
because
of
that
there
was
always
a
charged
atmosphere
the
merriest
idlest
most
careless
moment
might
in
the
flash
of
an
eye
end
in
ruthless
and
tragic
action
in
an
assemblage
of
desperate
characters
it
could
not
be
otherwise
the
terrible
thing
that
duane
sensed
was
this
the
valley
was
beautiful
sunny
fragrant
a
place
to
dream
in
the
mountaintops
were
always
blue
or
gold
rimmed
the
yellow
river
slid
slowly
and
majestically
by
the
birds
sang
in
the
cottonwoods
the
horses
grazed
and
pranced
children
played
and
women
longed
for
love
freedom
happiness
the
outlaws
rode
in
and
out
free
with
money
and
speech
they
lived
comfortably
in
their
adobe
homes
smoked
gambled
talked
laughed
whiled
away
the
idle
hours
and
all
the
time
life
there
was
wrong
and
the
simplest
moment
might
be
precipitated
by
that
evil
into
the
most
awful
of
contrasts
duane
felt
rather
than
saw
a
dark
brooding
shadow
over
the
valley
then
without
any
solicitation
or
encouragement
from
duane
the
bland
woman
fell
passionately
in
love
with
him
his
conscience
was
never
troubled
about
the
beginning
of
that
affair
she
launched
herself
it
took
no
great
perspicuity
on
his
part
to
see
that
and
the
thing
which
evidently
held
her
in
check
was
the
newness
the
strangeness
and
for
the
moment
the
fact
of
his
respect
for
her
duane
exerted
himself
to
please
to
amuse
to
interest
to
fascinate
her
and
always
with
deference
that
was
his
strong
point
and
it
had
made
his
part
easy
so
far
he
believed
he
could
carry
the
whole
scheme
through
without
involving
himself
any
deeper
he
was
playing
at
a
game
of
love
playing
with
life
and
deaths
sometimes
he
trembled
not
that
he
feared
bland
or
alloway
or
any
other
man
but
at
the
deeps
of
life
he
had
come
to
see
into
he
was
carried
out
of
his
old
mood
not
once
since
this
daring
motive
had
stirred
him
had
he
been
haunted
by
the
phantom
of
bain
beside
his
bed
rather
had
he
been
haunted
by
jennie
sad
face
her
wistful
smile
her
eyes
he
never
was
able
to
speak
a
word
to
her
what
little
communication
he
had
with
her
was
through
euchre
who
carried
short
messages
but
he
caught
glimpses
of
her
every
time
he
went
to
the
bland
house
she
contrived
somehow
to
pass
door
or
window
to
give
him
a
look
when
chance
afforded
and
duane
discovered
with
surprise
that
these
moments
were
more
thrilling
to
him
than
any
with
mrs
bland
often
duane
knew
jennie
was
sitting
just
inside
the
window
and
then
he
felt
inspired
in
his
talk
and
it
was
all
made
for
her
so
at
least
she
came
to
know
him
while
as
yet
she
was
almost
a
stranger
jennie
had
been
instructed
by
euchre
to
listen
to
understand
that
this
was
duane
only
chance
to
help
keep
her
mind
from
constant
worry
to
gather
the
import
of
every
word
which
had
a
double
meaning
euchre
said
that
the
girl
had
begun
to
wither
under
the
strain
to
burn
up
with
intense
hope
which
had
flamed
within
her
but
all
the
difference
duane
could
see
was
a
paler
face
and
darker
more
wonderful
eyes
the
eyes
seemed
to
be
entreating
him
to
hurry
that
time
was
flying
that
soon
it
might
be
too
late
then
there
was
another
meaning
in
them
a
light
a
strange
fire
wholly
inexplicable
to
duane
it
was
only
a
flash
gone
in
an
instant
but
he
remembered
it
because
he
had
never
seen
it
in
any
other
woman
eyes
and
all
through
those
waiting
days
he
knew
that
jennie
face
and
especially
the
warm
fleeting
glance
she
gave
him
was
responsible
for
a
subtle
and
gradual
change
in
him
this
change
he
fancied
was
only
that
through
remembrance
of
her
he
got
rid
of
his
pale
sickening
ghosts
one
day
a
careless
mexican
threw
a
lighted
cigarette
up
into
the
brush
matting
that
served
as
a
ceiling
for
benson
den
and
there
was
a
fire
which
left
little
more
than
the
adobe
walls
standing
the
result
was
that
while
repairs
were
being
made
there
was
no
gambling
and
drinking
time
hung
very
heavily
on
the
hands
of
some
outlaws
days
passed
by
without
a
brawl
and
bland
valley
saw
more
successive
hours
of
peace
than
ever
before
duane
however
found
the
hours
anything
but
empty
he
spent
more
time
at
mrs
bland
he
walked
miles
on
all
the
trails
leading
out
of
the
valley
he
had
a
care
for
the
condition
of
his
two
horses
upon
his
return
from
the
latest
of
these
tramps
euchre
suggested
that
they
go
down
to
the
river
to
the
could
run
ashore
this
mornin
said
euchre
low
an
makin
it
hard
fer
hosses
there
a
greaser
stuck
in
the
mud
i
reckon
we
might
hear
news
from
the
freighters
bland
supposed
to
be
in
nearly
all
the
outlaws
in
camp
were
assembled
on
the
riverbank
lolling
in
the
shade
of
the
cottonwoods
the
heat
was
oppressive
not
an
outlaw
offered
to
help
the
freighters
who
were
trying
to
dig
a
heavily
freighted
wagon
out
of
the
quicksand
few
outlaws
would
work
for
themselves
let
alone
for
the
despised
mexicans
duane
and
euchre
joined
the
lazy
group
and
sat
down
with
them
euchre
lighted
a
black
pipe
and
drawing
his
hat
over
his
eyes
lay
back
in
comfort
after
the
manner
of
the
majority
of
the
outlaws
but
duane
was
alert
observing
thoughtful
he
never
missed
anything
it
was
his
belief
that
any
moment
an
idle
word
might
be
of
benefit
to
him
moreover
these
rough
men
were
always
interesting
been
chased
across
the
river
said
one
he
deliverin
cattle
to
thet
cuban
ship
replied
another
deal
on
hey
big
rugg
says
the
boss
hed
an
order
fer
fifteen
that
order
take
a
year
to
hardin
is
in
cahoots
with
bland
between
they
fill
orders
bigger
what
hardin
was
rustlin
in
here
duane
could
not
possibly
attend
to
all
the
conversation
among
the
outlaws
he
endeavored
to
get
the
drift
of
talk
nearest
to
him
fuller
goin
to
cash
said
a
little
outlaw
jim
was
tellin
me
ai
it
thet
hole
was
bad
but
he
took
the
fever
rejoined
a
comrade
says
the
kid
might
pull
through
if
he
hed
kate
bland
ai
nursin
any
boys
these
days
she
got
a
laugh
followed
this
sally
then
came
a
penetrating
silence
some
of
the
outlaws
glanced
at
duane
they
bore
him
no
ill
will
manifestly
they
were
aware
of
mrs
bland
infatuation
to
me
you
said
thet
wal
it
happened
this
remark
drew
louder
laughter
and
more
significant
glances
at
duane
he
did
not
choose
to
ignore
them
any
longer
poke
all
the
fun
you
like
at
me
but
do
mention
any
name
again
my
hand
is
nervous
and
itchy
these
he
smiled
as
he
spoke
and
his
speech
was
drawled
but
the
good
humor
in
no
wise
weakened
it
then
his
latter
remark
was
significant
to
a
class
of
men
who
from
inclination
and
necessity
practiced
at
until
they
wore
callous
and
sore
places
on
their
thumbs
and
inculcated
in
the
very
deeps
of
their
nervous
organization
a
habit
that
made
even
the
simplest
and
most
innocent
motion
of
the
hand
end
at
or
near
the
hip
there
was
something
remarkable
about
a
hand
it
never
seemed
to
be
gloved
never
to
be
injured
never
out
of
sight
or
in
an
awkward
position
there
were
grizzled
outlaws
in
that
group
some
of
whom
had
many
notches
on
their
and
they
with
their
comrades
accorded
duane
silence
that
carried
conviction
of
the
regard
in
which
he
was
held
duane
could
not
recall
any
other
instance
where
he
had
let
fall
a
familiar
speech
to
these
men
and
certainly
he
had
never
before
hinted
of
his
possibilities
he
saw
instantly
that
he
could
not
have
done
better
hot
ai
it
remarked
bill
black
presently
bill
could
not
keep
quiet
for
long
he
was
a
typical
texas
desperado
had
never
been
anything
else
he
was
and
from
much
riding
a
wiry
little
man
all
muscle
with
a
square
head
a
hard
face
partly
black
from
scrubby
beard
and
red
from
sun
and
a
bright
roving
cruel
eye
his
shirt
was
open
at
the
neck
showing
a
grizzled
breast
there
any
guy
in
this
heah
outfit
sport
enough
to
go
swimmin
he
asked
gawd
bill
you
ai
agoin
to
wash
exclaimed
a
comrade
this
raised
a
laugh
in
which
black
joined
but
no
one
seemed
eager
to
join
him
in
a
bath
outfit
i
ever
rustled
with
went
on
bill
discontentedly
to
do
say
if
nobody
wants
to
swim
maybe
some
of
gamble
he
produced
a
dirty
pack
of
cards
and
waved
them
at
the
motionless
crowd
you
too
good
at
cards
replied
a
lanky
outlaw
jasper
you
say
thet
powerful
sweet
an
you
look
sweet
er
i
might
take
it
to
heart
replied
black
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
here
it
was
again
that
upflashing
passion
what
jasper
saw
fit
to
reply
would
mollify
the
outlaw
or
it
would
not
there
was
an
even
balance
offense
bill
said
jasper
placidly
without
moving
bill
grunted
and
forgot
jasper
but
he
seemed
restless
and
dissatisfied
duane
knew
him
to
be
an
inveterate
gambler
and
as
benson
place
was
out
of
black
was
like
a
fish
on
dry
land
if
are
afraid
of
the
cairds
what
will
you
bet
on
he
asked
in
disgust
i
play
you
a
game
of
mumbly
peg
fer
two
replied
one
black
eagerly
accepted
betting
to
him
was
a
serious
matter
the
game
obsessed
him
not
the
stakes
he
entered
into
the
mumbly
peg
contest
with
a
thoughtful
mien
and
a
corded
brow
he
won
other
comrades
tried
their
luck
with
him
and
lost
finally
when
bill
had
exhausted
their
supply
of
pieces
or
their
desire
for
that
particular
game
he
offered
to
bet
on
anything
thet
there
he
said
pointing
bet
he
scare
at
one
stone
or
he
wo
five
pesos
he
fly
or
he
wo
fly
when
some
one
chucks
a
stone
who
take
me
up
that
appeared
to
be
more
than
the
gambling
spirit
of
several
outlaws
could
withstand
thet
easy
money
said
one
goin
to
chuck
the
stone
asked
another
replied
bill
i
bet
you
i
can
scare
him
with
one
stone
said
the
first
outlaw
in
on
thet
jim
to
fire
the
darnick
chimed
in
the
others
the
money
was
put
up
the
stone
thrown
the
took
flight
to
the
great
joy
of
all
the
outlaws
except
bill
bet
he
come
back
to
thet
tree
inside
of
five
minnits
he
offered
imperturbably
hereupon
the
outlaws
did
not
show
any
laziness
in
their
alacrity
to
cover
bill
money
as
it
lay
on
the
grass
somebody
had
a
watch
and
they
all
sat
down
dividing
attention
between
the
timepiece
and
the
tree
the
minutes
dragged
by
to
the
accompaniment
of
various
jocular
remarks
anent
a
fool
and
his
money
when
four
and
minutes
had
passed
a
alighted
in
the
cottonwood
then
ensued
an
impressive
silence
while
bill
calmly
pocketed
the
fifty
dollars
it
had
the
same
dove
exclaimed
one
outlaw
excitedly
smaller
dustier
not
so
bill
eyed
the
speaker
loftily
you
have
to
ketch
the
other
one
to
prove
thet
sabe
pard
now
i
bet
any
gent
heah
the
fifty
i
won
thet
i
can
scare
thet
dove
with
one
no
one
offered
to
take
his
wager
then
i
bet
any
of
you
even
money
thet
you
ca
scare
him
with
one
not
proof
against
this
chance
the
outlaws
made
up
a
purse
in
no
wise
disconcerted
by
bill
contemptuous
allusions
to
their
banding
together
the
stone
was
thrown
the
dove
did
not
fly
thereafter
in
regard
to
that
bird
bill
was
unable
to
coax
or
scorn
his
comrades
into
any
kind
of
wager
he
tried
them
with
a
multiplicity
of
offers
and
in
vain
then
he
appeared
at
a
loss
for
some
unusual
and
seductive
wager
presently
a
little
ragged
mexican
boy
came
along
the
river
trail
a
particularly
starved
and
little
fellow
bill
called
to
him
and
gave
him
a
handful
of
silver
coins
speechless
dazed
he
went
his
way
hugging
the
money
bet
he
drops
some
before
he
gits
to
the
road
declared
bill
bet
he
runs
hurry
you
bill
failed
to
interest
any
of
his
companions
and
forthwith
became
sullen
and
silent
strangely
his
good
humor
departed
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
won
considerable
duane
watching
the
disgruntled
outlaw
marveled
at
him
and
wondered
what
was
in
his
mind
these
men
were
more
variable
than
children
as
unstable
as
water
as
dangerous
as
dynamite
i
bet
you
ten
you
ca
spill
whatever
in
the
bucket
thet
peon
packin
said
the
outlaw
called
jim
black
head
came
up
with
the
action
of
a
hawk
about
to
swoop
duane
glanced
from
black
to
the
road
where
he
saw
a
crippled
peon
carrying
a
tin
bucket
toward
the
river
this
peon
was
a
indian
who
lived
in
a
shack
and
did
odd
jobs
for
the
mexicans
duane
had
met
him
often
i
take
you
up
replied
black
something
perhaps
a
harshness
in
his
voice
caused
duane
to
whirl
he
caught
a
leaping
gleam
in
the
outlaw
eye
bill
thet
too
fur
a
shot
said
jasper
as
black
rested
an
elbow
on
his
knee
and
sighted
over
the
long
heavy
colt
the
distance
to
the
peon
was
about
fifty
paces
too
far
for
even
the
most
expert
shot
to
hit
a
moving
object
so
small
as
a
bucket
duane
marvelously
keen
in
the
alignment
of
sights
was
positive
that
black
held
too
high
another
look
at
the
hard
face
now
tense
and
dark
with
blood
confirmed
duane
suspicion
that
the
outlaw
was
not
aiming
at
the
bucket
at
all
duane
leaped
and
struck
the
leveled
gun
out
of
his
hand
another
outlaw
picked
it
up
black
fell
back
astounded
deprived
of
his
weapon
he
did
not
seem
the
same
man
or
else
he
was
cowed
by
duane
significant
and
formidable
front
sullenly
he
turned
away
without
even
asking
for
his
gun
chapter
viii
what
a
contrast
duane
thought
the
evening
of
that
day
presented
to
the
state
of
his
soul
the
sunset
lingered
in
golden
glory
over
the
distant
mexican
mountains
twilight
came
slowly
a
faint
breeze
blew
from
the
river
cool
and
sweet
the
late
cooing
of
a
dove
and
the
tinkle
of
a
cowbell
were
the
only
sounds
a
serene
and
tranquil
peace
lay
over
the
valley
inside
duane
body
there
was
strife
this
third
facing
of
a
desperate
man
had
thrown
him
off
his
balance
it
had
not
been
fatal
but
it
threatened
so
much
the
better
side
of
his
nature
seemed
to
urge
him
to
die
rather
than
to
go
on
fighting
or
opposing
ignorant
unfortunate
savage
men
but
the
perversity
of
him
was
so
great
that
it
dwarfed
reason
conscience
he
could
not
resist
it
he
felt
something
dying
in
him
he
suffered
hope
seemed
far
away
despair
had
seized
upon
him
and
was
driving
him
into
a
reckless
mood
when
he
thought
of
jennie
he
had
forgotten
her
he
had
forgotten
that
he
had
promised
to
save
her
he
had
forgotten
that
he
meant
to
snuff
out
as
many
lives
as
might
stand
between
her
and
freedom
the
very
remembrance
sheered
off
his
morbid
introspection
she
made
a
difference
how
strange
for
him
to
realize
that
he
felt
grateful
to
her
he
had
been
forced
into
outlawry
she
had
been
stolen
from
her
people
and
carried
into
captivity
they
had
met
in
the
river
fastness
he
to
instil
hope
into
her
despairing
life
she
to
be
the
means
perhaps
of
keeping
him
from
sinking
to
the
level
of
her
captors
he
became
conscious
of
a
strong
and
beating
desire
to
see
her
talk
with
her
these
thoughts
had
run
through
his
mind
while
on
his
way
to
mrs
house
he
had
let
euchre
go
on
ahead
because
he
wanted
more
time
to
compose
himself
darkness
had
about
set
in
when
he
reached
his
destination
there
was
no
light
in
the
house
mrs
bland
was
waiting
for
him
on
the
porch
she
embraced
him
and
the
sudden
violent
unfamiliar
contact
sent
such
a
shock
through
him
that
he
all
but
forgot
the
deep
game
he
was
playing
she
however
in
her
agitation
did
not
notice
his
shrinking
from
her
embrace
and
the
tender
incoherent
words
that
flowed
with
it
he
gathered
that
euchre
had
acquainted
her
of
his
action
with
black
might
have
killed
you
she
whispered
more
clearly
and
if
duane
had
ever
heard
love
in
a
voice
he
heard
it
then
it
softened
him
after
all
she
was
a
woman
weak
fated
through
her
nature
unfortunate
in
her
experience
of
life
doomed
to
unhappiness
and
tragedy
he
met
her
advance
so
far
that
he
returned
the
embrace
and
kissed
her
emotion
such
as
she
showed
would
have
made
any
woman
sweet
and
she
had
a
certain
charm
it
was
easy
even
pleasant
to
kiss
her
but
duane
resolved
that
whatever
her
abandonment
might
become
he
would
not
go
further
than
the
lie
she
made
him
act
you
love
me
she
whispered
yes
he
burst
out
eager
to
get
it
over
and
even
as
he
spoke
he
caught
the
pale
gleam
of
jennie
face
through
the
window
he
felt
a
shame
he
was
glad
she
could
not
see
did
she
remember
that
she
had
promised
not
to
misunderstand
any
action
of
his
what
did
she
think
of
him
seeing
him
out
there
in
the
dusk
with
this
bold
woman
in
his
arms
somehow
that
dim
sight
of
jennie
pale
face
the
big
dark
eyes
thrilled
him
inspired
him
to
his
hard
task
of
the
present
dear
he
said
to
the
woman
and
he
meant
his
words
for
the
girl
going
to
take
you
away
from
this
outlaw
den
if
i
have
to
kill
bland
alloway
rugg
anybody
who
stands
in
my
path
you
were
dragged
here
you
are
good
i
know
it
there
happiness
for
you
somewhere
a
home
among
good
people
who
will
care
for
you
just
wait
till
his
voice
trailed
off
and
failed
from
excess
of
emotion
kate
bland
closed
her
eyes
and
leaned
her
head
on
his
breast
duane
felt
her
heart
beat
against
his
and
conscience
smote
him
a
keen
blow
if
she
loved
him
so
much
but
memory
and
understanding
of
her
character
hardened
him
again
and
he
gave
her
such
commiseration
as
was
due
her
sex
and
no
more
that
good
of
you
she
whispered
it
too
late
i
done
for
i
ca
leave
bland
all
i
ask
is
that
you
love
me
a
little
and
stop
your
the
moon
had
risen
over
the
eastern
bulge
of
dark
mountain
and
now
the
valley
was
flooded
with
mellow
light
and
shadows
of
cottonwoods
wavered
against
the
silver
suddenly
the
of
hoofs
caused
duane
to
raise
his
head
and
listen
horses
were
coming
down
the
road
from
the
head
of
the
valley
the
hour
was
unusual
for
riders
to
come
in
presently
the
narrow
moonlit
lane
was
crossed
at
its
far
end
by
black
moving
objects
two
horses
duane
discerned
bland
whispered
the
woman
grasping
duane
with
shaking
hands
must
run
no
he
see
you
that
be
worse
it
bland
i
know
his
horse
you
said
he
would
mind
my
calling
here
protested
duane
with
me
it
be
all
so
she
replied
with
visible
effort
at
manifestly
she
had
a
great
fear
of
bland
i
could
only
think
then
she
dragged
duane
to
the
door
pushed
him
in
come
out
with
me
duane
you
stay
with
the
girl
i
tell
bland
you
in
love
with
her
jen
if
you
give
us
away
i
wring
your
the
swift
action
and
fierce
whisper
told
duane
that
mrs
bland
was
herself
again
duane
stepped
close
to
jennie
who
stood
near
the
window
neither
spoke
but
her
hands
were
outstretched
to
meet
his
own
they
were
small
trembling
hands
cold
as
ice
he
held
them
close
trying
to
convey
what
he
felt
that
he
would
protect
her
she
leaned
against
him
and
they
looked
out
of
the
window
duane
felt
calm
and
sure
of
himself
his
most
pronounced
feeling
besides
that
for
the
frightened
girl
was
a
curiosity
as
to
how
mrs
bland
would
rise
to
the
occasion
he
saw
the
riders
dismount
down
the
lane
and
wearily
come
forward
a
boy
led
away
the
horses
euchre
the
old
fox
was
talking
loud
and
with
remarkable
ease
considering
what
he
claimed
was
his
natural
cowardice
that
was
way
back
in
the
sixties
about
the
time
of
the
war
he
was
saying
cattle
was
nuthin
then
to
what
it
is
now
times
is
rougher
these
days
this
has
come
to
be
a
disease
men
have
an
itch
for
the
draw
same
as
they
used
to
have
fer
poker
the
only
real
gambler
outside
of
greasers
we
ever
had
here
was
bill
an
i
presume
bill
is
burnin
the
approaching
outlaws
hearing
voices
halted
a
rod
or
so
from
the
porch
then
mrs
bland
uttered
an
exclamation
ostensibly
meant
to
express
surprise
and
hurried
out
to
meet
them
she
greeted
her
husband
warmly
and
gave
welcome
to
the
other
man
duane
could
not
see
well
enough
in
the
shadow
to
recognize
bland
companion
but
he
believed
it
was
alloway
we
are
and
starved
said
bland
heavily
here
with
you
euchre
on
the
porch
duane
is
inside
at
the
window
with
jen
replied
mrs
bland
he
exclaimed
then
he
whispered
low
something
duane
could
not
catch
i
asked
him
to
come
said
the
chief
wife
she
spoke
easily
and
naturally
and
made
no
change
in
tone
has
been
ailing
she
gets
thinner
and
whiter
every
day
duane
came
here
one
day
with
euchre
saw
jen
and
went
loony
over
her
pretty
face
same
as
all
you
men
so
i
let
him
bland
cursed
low
and
deep
under
his
breath
the
other
man
made
a
violent
action
of
some
kind
and
apparently
was
quieted
by
a
restraining
hand
you
let
duane
make
love
to
jennie
queried
bland
incredulously
i
did
replied
the
wife
stubbornly
not
jen
in
love
with
him
if
he
takes
her
away
and
marries
her
she
can
be
a
decent
bland
kept
silent
a
moment
then
his
laugh
pealed
out
loud
and
harsh
did
you
get
that
well
by
god
what
do
you
think
of
my
wife
lyin
or
she
crazy
replied
alloway
and
his
voice
carried
an
unpleasant
ring
mrs
bland
promptly
and
indignantly
told
her
husband
lieutenant
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
ho
ho
rolled
out
bland
laugh
then
he
led
the
way
to
the
porch
his
spurs
clinking
the
weapons
he
was
carrying
rattling
and
he
flopped
down
on
a
bench
are
you
boss
asked
euchre
old
man
i
well
but
all
alloway
slowly
walked
on
to
the
porch
and
leaned
against
the
rail
he
answered
euchre
greeting
with
a
nod
then
he
stood
there
a
dark
silent
figure
mrs
bland
full
voice
in
eager
questioning
had
a
tendency
to
ease
the
situation
bland
replied
briefly
to
her
reporting
a
remarkably
successful
trip
duane
thought
it
time
to
show
himself
he
had
a
feeling
that
bland
and
alloway
would
let
him
go
for
the
moment
they
were
plainly
and
alloway
seemed
sullen
brooding
whispered
duane
was
clever
of
mrs
bland
we
keep
up
the
deception
any
day
now
be
ready
she
pressed
close
to
him
and
a
barely
audible
came
breathing
into
his
ear
night
jennie
he
said
aloud
you
feel
better
then
he
stepped
out
into
the
moonlight
and
spoke
bland
returned
the
greeting
and
though
he
was
not
amiable
he
did
not
show
resentment
jasper
as
i
rode
in
said
bland
presently
told
me
you
made
bill
black
mad
and
there
liable
to
be
a
fight
what
did
you
go
off
the

dead

on
my
chest
at
night
that

trouble

driven
to
it
to
forget
the
last
i
no

duane
made
me
doubt
interrupted
bland
with
a
laugh
made
me
a
rustler
you
do
know
yourself

young
you
got
a
temper
your
father
was
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
texas

any
other
career
for
you
instead
of
going

alone
a
lone
wolf
as
the
texans
say
why
not
make
friends
with
other
outlaws
you
live
euchre
squirmed
in
his
seat
i
been
givin
the
boy
egzactly
thet
same
line
of
talk
why
i
took
him
in
to
bunk
with
me
if
he
makes
pards
among
us
there
wo
be
any
more
trouble
an
he
be
a
grand
feller
fer
the
gang
seen
wild
bill
hickok
throw
a
gun
an
billy
the
kid
an
hardin
chess
here
all
the
fastest
men
on
the
border
an
with
apologies
to
present
company
i
here
to
say
duane
has
them
all
skinned
his
draw
is
different
you
ca
see
how
he
does
euchre
admiring
praise
served
to
create
an
effective
little
silence
alloway
shifted
uneasily
on
his
feet
his
spurs
jangling
faintly
and
did
not
lift
his
head
bland
seemed
thoughtful
about
the
only
qualification
i
have
to
make
me
eligible
for
your
band
said
duane
easily
good
enough
replied
bland
shortly
you
consider
the
idea
think
it
over
good
he
left
the
group
followed
by
euchre
when
they
reached
the
end
of
the
lane
and
before
they
had
exchanged
a
word
bland
called
euchre
back
duane
proceeded
slowly
along
the
moonlit
road
to
the
cabin
and
sat
down
under
the
cottonwoods
to
wait
for
euchre
the
night
was
intense
and
quiet
a
low
hum
of
insects
giving
the
effect
of
a
congestion
of
life
the
beauty
of
the
soaring
moon
the
ebony
canyons
of
shadow
under
the
mountain
the
melancholy
serenity
of
the
perfect
night
made
duane
shudder
in
the
realization
of
how
far
aloof
he
now
was
from
enjoyment
of
these
things
never
again
so
long
as
he
lived
could
he
be
natural
his
mind
was
clouded
his
eye
and
ear
henceforth
must
register
impressions
of
nature
but
the
joy
of
them
had
fled
still
as
he
sat
there
with
a
foreboding
of
more
and
darker
work
ahead
of
him
there
was
yet
a
strange
sweetness
left
to
him
and
it
lay
in
thought
of
jennie
the
pressure
of
her
cold
little
hands
lingered
in
his
he
did
not
think
of
her
as
a
woman
and
he
did
not
analyze
his
feelings
he
just
had
vague
dreamy
thoughts
and
imaginations
that
were
interspersed
in
the
constant
and
stern
revolving
of
plans
to
save
her
a
shuffling
step
roused
him
euchre
dark
figure
came
crossing
the
moonlit
grass
under
the
cottonwoods
the
moment
the
outlaw
reached
him
duane
saw
that
he
was
laboring
under
great
excitement
it
scarcely
affected
duane
he
seemed
to
be
acquiring
patience
calmness
strength
kept
you
pretty
long
he
said
till
i
git
my
breath
replied
euchre
he
sat
silent
a
little
while
fanning
himself
with
a
sombrero
though
the
night
was
cool
and
then
he
went
into
the
cabin
to
return
presently
with
a
lighted
pipe
night
he
said
and
his
tone
further
acquainted
duane
with
euchre
quaint
humor
night
for
by
gum
noticed
that
rejoined
duane
dryly
i
a
son
of
a
gun
if
i
did
stand
an
watch
bland
choke
his
wife
till
her
tongue
stuck
out
an
she
got
black
in
the
ejaculated
duane
to
die
if
i
did
buck
listen
to
this
here
yarn
when
i
got
back
to
the
porch
i
seen
bland
was
wakin
up
he
been
too
fagged
out
to
figger
much
alloway
an
kate
had
gone
in
the
house
where
they
lit
up
the
lamps
i
heard
kate
high
voice
but
alloway
never
chirped
not
the
talkin
kind
an
he
damn
dangerous
when
he
thet
way
bland
asked
me
some
questions
right
from
the
shoulder
i
was
ready
for
them
an
i
swore
the
moon
was
green
cheese
he
was
satisfied
bland
always
trusted
me
an
liked
me
too
i
reckon
i
hated
to
lie
black
thet
way
but
he
a
hard
man
with
bad
intentions
toward
jennie
an
him
any
day
we
went
into
the
house
jennie
had
gone
to
her
little
room
an
bland
called
her
to
come
out
she
said
she
was
undressin
an
he
ordered
her
to
put
her
clothes
back
on
then
buck
his
next
move
was
some
surprisin
he
deliberately
thronged
a
gun
on
kate
yes
sir
he
pointed
his
big
blue
colt
right
at
her
an
he
says
a
mind
to
blow
out
your
brains
ahead
says
kate
cool
as
could
be
lied
to
me
he
roars
laughed
in
his
face
bland
slammed
the
gun
down
an
made
a
grab
fer
her
she
fought
him
but
was
a
match
fer
him
an
he
got
her
by
the
throat
he
choked
her
till
i
thought
she
was
strangled
alloway
made
him
stop
she
flopped
down
on
the
bed
an
gasped
fer
a
while
when
she
come
to
them
hardshelled
cusses
went
after
her
trying
to
make
her
give
herself
away
i
think
bland
was
jealous
he
suspected
she
got
thick
with
you
an
was
foolin
him
i
reckon
thet
a
sore
feelin
fer
a
man
to
have
to
guess
pretty
nice
but
not
to
be
sure
bland
gave
it
up
after
a
while
an
then
he
cussed
an
raved
at
her

if
you
only
could
have
seen
her
she
thronged
up
her
head
an
her
eyes
were
full
of
fire
bland
seemed
dazed
at
sight
of
her
an
alloway
why
thet
little
skunk
of
an
outlaw
cried
right
out
he
was
hit
plumb
center
he
in
love
with
jen
an
the
look
of
her
then
was
enough
to
make
any
feller
quit
he
jest
slunk
out
of
the
room
i
told
you
mebbe
thet
he
been
tryin
to
git
bland
to

jen
to
him
so
even
a
tough
like
alloway
can
love
a
woman
stamped
up
an
down
the
room
he
sure

dyin
hard
he
said
once
more
turnin
to
her
swear
in
fear
of
your
life
thet
you
tellin
truth
kate
not
in
love
with
duane
she
let
him
come
to
see
you
there

nuthin
between
them
i
swear
answered
jennie
an
bland
sat
down
like
a
man
licked
to
bed
you
bland
choked
on
some
word
or
other
a
bad
one
i
reckon
an
he
positively
shook
in
his
chair
went
then
an
kate
began
to
have
hysterics
an
your
uncle
euchre
ducked
his
nut
out
of
the
door
an
come
duane
did
not
have
a
word
to
say
at
the
end
of
euchre
long
harangue
he
experienced
relief
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
expected
a
good
deal
worse
he
thrilled
at
the
thought
of
jennie
perjuring
herself
to
save
that
abandoned
woman
what
mysteries
these
feminine
creatures
were
there
where
our
little
deal
stands
now
resumed
euchre
meditatively
know
buck
as
well
as
me
thet
if
you
been
some
feller
who
had
shown
he
was
a
wonder
with
a
gun
you
now
be
full
of
lead
if
you
happen
to
kill
bland
an
alloway
i
reckon
you
be
as
safe
on
this
here
border
as
you
would
in
santone
such
is
gun
fame
in
this
land
of
the
chapter
ix
both
men
were
awake
early
silent
with
the
premonition
of
trouble
ahead
thoughtful
of
the
fact
that
the
time
for
the
action
was
at
hand
it
was
remarkable
that
a
man
as
loquacious
as
euchre
could
hold
his
tongue
so
long
and
this
was
significant
of
the
deadly
nature
of
the
intended
deed
during
breakfast
he
said
a
few
words
customary
in
the
service
of
food
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
he
seemed
to
come
to
an
end
of
deliberation
the
sooner
the
better
now
he
declared
with
a
glint
in
his
eye
more
time
we
use
up
now
the
less
surprised
bland
ready
when
you
are
replied
duane
quietly
and
he
rose
from
the
table
saddle
up
then
went
on
euchre
gruffly
on
them
two
packs
i
made
one
fer
each
saddle
you
ca
tell
mebbe
either
hoss
will
be
carryin
double
it
good
they
both
big
strong
hosses
guess
thet
was
a
wise
move
of
your
uncle
euchre
bringin
in
your
hosses
havin
them
ready
i
hope
you
not
going
to
get
in
bad
here
i
afraid
you
are
let
me
do
the
rest
now
said
duane
the
old
outlaw
eyed
him
sarcastically
be
turrible
now
would
it
if
you
want
to
know
why
i
in
bad
already
i
did
tell
you
thet
alloway
called
me
last
night
gettin
wise
pretty
you
going
with
me
queried
duane
suddenly
divining
the
truth
i
reckon
either
to
hell
or
safe
over
the
mountain
i
wisht
i
was
a
i
hate
to
leave
here
without
takin
a
peg
at
jackrabbit
benson
now
buck
you
do
some
hard
figgerin
while
i
go
nosin
round
it
pretty
early
which
all
the
euchre
put
on
his
sombrero
and
as
he
went
out
duane
saw
that
he
wore
a
belt
it
was
the
first
time
duane
had
ever
seen
the
outlaw
armed
duane
packed
his
few
belongings
into
his
saddlebags
and
then
carried
the
saddles
out
to
the
corral
an
abundance
of
alfalfa
in
the
corral
showed
that
the
horses
had
fared
well
they
had
gotten
almost
fat
during
his
stay
in
the
valley
he
watered
them
put
on
the
saddles
loosely
cinched
and
then
the
bridles
his
next
move
was
to
fill
the
two
canvas
that
done
he
returned
to
the
cabin
to
wait
at
the
moment
he
felt
no
excitement
or
agitation
of
any
kind
there
was
no
more
thinking
and
planning
to
do
the
hour
had
arrived
and
he
was
ready
he
understood
perfectly
the
desperate
chances
he
must
take
his
thoughts
became
confined
to
euchre
and
the
surprising
loyalty
and
goodness
in
the
hardened
old
outlaw
time
passed
slowly
duane
kept
glancing
at
his
watch
he
hoped
to
start
the
thing
and
get
away
before
the
outlaws
were
out
of
their
beds
finally
he
heard
the
shuffle
of
euchre
boots
on
the
hard
path
the
sound
was
quicker
than
usual
when
euchre
came
around
the
corner
of
the
cabin
duane
was
not
so
astounded
as
he
was
concerned
to
see
the
outlaw
white
and
shaking
sweat
dripped
from
him
he
had
a
wild
look
ours
buck
he
panted
do
look
it
replied
duane
turrible
sick
jest
killed
a
man
fust
one
i
ever
killed
asked
duane
startled
benson
an
sick
as
i
am
i
gloryin
in
it
i
went
round
up
the
road
saw
alloway
goin
into
deger
he
thick
with
the
degers
reckon
he
askin
questions
anyway
i
was
sure
glad
to
see
him
away
from
bland
an
he
did
see
me
when
i
dropped
into
there
was
nobody
there
but
jackrabbit
an
some
greasers
he
was
startin
to
work
benson
never
had
no
use
fer
me
an
he
up
an
said
he
would
give
a
piece
fer
my
life
i
asked
him
why
the
boss
an
chess
he
said
what
you
give
fer
your
own
life
i
asked
him
straightened
up
surprised
an
an
i
let
him
have
it
plumb
center
he
wilted
an
the
greasers
run
i
reckon
i
never
sleep
again
but
i
had
to
do
duane
asked
if
the
shot
had
attracted
any
attention
outside
did
see
anybody
but
the
greasers
an
i
sure
looked
sharp
back
i
cut
across
through
the
cottonwoods
past
bland
cabin
i
meant
to
keep
out
of
sight
but
somehow
i
had
an
idee
i
might
find
out
if
bland
was
awake
yet
sure
enough
i
run
plumb
into
beppo
the
boy
who
tends
bland
hosses
beppo
likes
me
an
when
i
inquired
of
his
boss
he
said
bland
had
been
up
all
night
fightin
with
the
senora
an
buck
how
i
figger
bland
could
let
up
last
night
he
was
sore
an
he
went
after
kate
again
tryin
to
wear
her
down
jest
as
likely
he
might
have
went
after
jennie
with
wuss
intentions
anyway
he
an
kate
must
have
had
it
hot
an
heavy
we
pretty
seems

duane
tersely
i
should
smiler

after
a
most
ride
home

be
fagged
out
this
mornin

thought
over
his
proposition
an

ready

his
band
or
you
ai
you
have
to
kill
him
an
it
save
time
to
go
fer
your
gun
on
sight
might
be
wise
too
fer
it
likely
he
do
thet
about
the
horses
fetch
them
an
come
along
about
two
minnits
behind
you
to
me
you
ought
to

the
time

mix
any
more
in
this
said
duane
earnestly
i
goin
you
heard
what
benson
told
me
alloway
would
give
me
the
benefit
of
any
doubts
buck
a
last
word
look
out
fer
thet
bland
woman
duane
merely
nodded
and
then
saying
that
the
horses
were
ready
he
strode
away
through
the
grove
accounting
for
the
short
cut
across
grove
and
field
it
was
about
five
minutes
walk
up
to
bland
house
to
duane
it
seemed
long
in
time
and
distance
and
he
had
difficulty
in
restraining
his
pace
as
he
walked
there
came
a
gradual
and
subtle
change
in
his
feelings
again
he
was
going
out
to
meet
a
man
in
conflict
he
could
have
avoided
this
meeting
but
despite
the
fact
of
his
courting
the
encounter
he
had
not
as
yet
felt
that
hot
inexplicable
rush
of
blood
the
motive
of
this
deadly
action
was
not
personal
and
somehow
that
made
a
difference
no
outlaws
were
in
sight
he
saw
several
mexican
herders
with
cattle
blue
columns
of
smoke
curled
up
over
some
of
the
cabins
the
fragrant
smell
of
it
reminded
duane
of
his
home
and
cutting
wood
for
the
stove
he
noted
a
cloud
of
creamy
mist
rising
above
the
river
dissolving
in
the
sunlight
then
he
entered
bland
lane
while
yet
some
distance
from
the
cabin
he
heard
loud
angry
voices
of
man
and
woman
bland
and
kate
still
quarreling
he
took
a
quick
survey
of
the
surroundings
there
was
now
not
even
a
mexican
in
sight
then
he
hurried
a
little
halfway
down
the
lane
he
turned
his
head
to
peer
through
the
cottonwoods
this
time
he
saw
euchre
coming
with
the
horses
there
was
no
indication
that
the
old
outlaw
might
lose
his
nerve
at
the
end
duane
had
feared
this
duane
now
changed
his
walk
to
a
leisurely
saunter
he
reached
the
porch
and
then
distinguished
what
was
said
inside
the
cabin
you
do
bland
by
heaven
i
fix
you
and
her
that
was
panted
out
in
kate
bland
full
voice
me
looser
i
going
in
there
i
tell
you
replied
bland
hoarsely
for
want
to
make
a
little
love
to
her
ha
ha
it
be
fun
to
have
the
laugh
on
her
new
lie
cried
kate
bland
not
saying
what
i
do
to
her
afterward
his
voice
grew
hoarser
with
passion
me
go
now
no
i
wo
let
you
go
you
choke
the
the
truth
out
of
her
you
kill
truth
hissed
bland
i
lied
jen
lied
but
she
lied
to
save
me
you
need
murder
her
for
bland
cursed
horribly
then
followed
a
wrestling
sound
of
bodies
in
violent
straining
contact
the
scrape
of
feet
the
jangle
of
spurs
a
crash
of
sliding
table
or
chair
and
then
the
cry
of
a
woman
in
pain
duane
stepped
into
the
open
door
inside
the
room
kate
bland
lay
half
across
a
table
where
she
had
been
flung
and
she
was
trying
to
get
to
her
feet
bland
back
was
turned
he
had
opened
the
door
into
room
and
had
one
foot
across
the
threshold
duane
caught
the
girl
low
shuddering
cry
then
he
called
out
loud
and
clear
with
swiftness
bland
wheeled
then
froze
on
the
threshold
his
sight
quick
as
his
action
caught
duane
menacing
unmistakable
position
bland
big
frame
filled
the
door
he
was
in
a
bad
place
to
reach
for
his
gun
but
he
would
not
have
time
for
a
step
duane
read
in
his
eyes
the
desperate
calculation
of
chances
for
a
fleeting
instant
bland
shifted
his
glance
to
his
wife
then
his
whole
body
seemed
to
vibrate
with
the
swing
of
his
arm
duane
shot
him
he
fell
forward
his
gun
exploding
as
it
hit
into
the
floor
and
dropped
loose
from
stretching
fingers
duane
stood
over
him
stooped
to
turn
him
on
his
back
bland
looked
up
with
clouded
gaze
then
gasped
his
last
you
killed
him
cried
kate
bland
huskily
knew
have
to
she
staggered
against
the
wall
her
eyes
dilating
her
strong
hands
clenching
her
face
slowly
whitening
she
appeared
shocked
half
stunned
but
showed
no
grief
called
duane
sharply
duane
came
a
halting
reply
come
out
hurry
she
came
out
with
uneven
steps
seeing
only
him
and
she
stumbled
over
bland
body
duane
caught
her
arm
swung
her
behind
him
he
feared
the
woman
when
she
realized
how
she
had
been
duped
his
action
was
protective
and
his
movement
toward
the
door
equally
as
significant
cried
mrs
bland
it
was
no
time
for
talk
duane
edged
on
keeping
jennie
behind
him
at
that
moment
there
was
a
pounding
of
hoofs
out
in
the
lane
kate
bland
bounded
to
the
door
when
she
turned
back
her
amazement
was
changing
to
realization
you
taking
jen
she
cried
her
voice
like
a
man
out
of
my
way
replied
duane
his
look
perhaps
without
speech
was
enough
for
her
in
an
instant
she
was
transformed
into
a
fury
hound
all
the
time
you
were
fooling
me
you
made
love
to
me
you
let
me
believe
you
swore
you
loved
me
now
i
see
what
was
queer
about
you
all
for
that
girl
but
you
ca
have
her
you
never
leave
here
alive
give
me
that
girl
let
me
get
at
her
she
never
win
any
more
men
in
this
she
was
a
powerful
woman
and
it
took
all
duane
strength
to
ward
off
her
onslaughts
she
clawed
at
jennie
over
his
upheld
arm
every
second
her
fury
increased
help
help
she
shrieked
in
a
voice
that
must
have
penetrated
to
the
remotest
cabin
in
the
valley
go
let
go
cried
duane
low
and
sharp
he
still
held
his
gun
in
his
right
hand
and
it
began
to
be
hard
for
him
to
ward
the
woman
off
his
coolness
had
gone
with
her
shriek
for
help
go
he
repeated
and
he
shoved
her
fiercely
suddenly
she
snatched
a
rifle
off
the
wall
and
backed
away
her
strong
hands
fumbling
at
the
lever
as
she
jerked
it
down
throwing
a
shell
into
the
chamber
and
cocking
the
weapon
duane
leaped
upon
her
he
struck
up
the
rifle
as
it
went
off
the
powder
burning
his
face
run
out
get
on
a
horse
he
said
jennie
flashed
out
of
the
door
with
an
iron
grasp
duane
held
to
the
he
had
grasped
it
with
his
left
hand
and
he
gave
such
a
pull
that
he
swung
the
crazed
woman
off
the
floor
but
he
could
not
loose
her
grip
she
was
as
strong
as
he
let
go
he
tried
to
intimidate
her
she
did
not
see
his
gun
thrust
in
her
face
or
reason
had
given
way
to
such
an
extent
to
passion
that
she
did
not
care
she
cursed
her
husband
had
used
the
same
curses
and
from
her
lips
they
seemed
strange
unsexed
more
deadly
like
a
tigress
she
fought
him
her
face
no
longer
resembled
a
woman
the
evil
of
that
outlaw
life
the
wildness
and
rage
the
meaning
to
kill
was
even
in
such
a
moment
terribly
impressed
upon
duane
he
heard
a
cry
from
outside
a
man
cry
hoarse
and
alarming
it
made
him
think
of
loss
of
time
this
demon
of
a
woman
might
yet
block
his
plan
go
he
whispered
and
felt
his
lips
stiff
in
the
grimness
of
that
instant
he
relaxed
his
hold
on
the
with
sudden
redoubled
irresistible
strength
she
wrenched
the
rifle
down
and
discharged
it
duane
felt
a
blow
a
shock
a
burning
agony
tearing
through
his
breast
then
in
a
frenzy
he
jerked
so
powerfully
upon
the
rifle
that
he
threw
the
woman
against
the
wall
she
fell
and
seemed
stunned
duane
leaped
back
whirled
flew
out
of
the
door
to
the
porch
the
sharp
cracking
of
a
gun
halted
him
he
saw
jennie
holding
to
the
bridle
of
his
bay
horse
euchre
was
astride
the
other
and
he
had
a
colt
leveled
and
he
was
firing
down
the
lane
then
came
a
single
shot
heavier
and
euchre
ceased
he
fell
from
the
horse
a
swift
glance
back
showed
to
duane
a
man
coming
down
the
lane
chess
alloway
his
gun
was
smoking
he
broke
into
a
run
then
in
an
instant
he
saw
duane
and
tried
to
check
his
pace
as
he
swung
up
his
arm
but
that
slight
pause
was
fatal
duane
shot
and
alloway
was
falling
when
his
gun
went
off
his
bullet
whistled
close
to
duane
and
thudded
into
the
cabin
duane
bounded
down
to
the
horses
jennie
was
trying
to
hold
the
plunging
bay
euchre
lay
flat
on
his
back
dead
a
in
his
shirt
his
face
set
hard
and
his
hands
twisted
round
gun
and
bridle
you
nerve
all
right
cried
duane
as
he
dragged
down
the
horse
she
was
holding
with
you
now
there
never
mind
long
stirrups
hang
on
somehow
he
caught
his
bridle
out
of
euchre
clutching
grip
and
leaped
astride
the
frightened
horses
jumped
into
a
run
and
thundered
down
the
lane
into
the
road
duane
saw
men
running
from
cabins
he
heard
shouts
but
there
were
no
shots
fired
jennie
seemed
able
to
stay
on
her
horse
but
without
stirrups
she
was
thrown
about
so
much
that
duane
rode
closer
and
reached
out
to
grasp
her
arm
thus
they
rode
through
the
valley
to
the
trail
that
led
up
over
the
steep
and
broken
rim
rock
as
they
began
to
climb
duane
looked
back
no
pursuers
were
in
sight
we
going
to
get
away
he
cried
exultation
for
her
in
his
voice
she
was
gazing
at
his
breast
as
in
turning
to
look
back
he
faced
her
duane
your
shirt
all
bloody
she
faltered
pointing
with
trembling
fingers
with
her
words
duane
became
aware
of
two
things
the
hand
he
instinctively
placed
to
his
breast
still
held
his
gun
and
he
had
sustained
a
terrible
wound
duane
had
been
shot
through
the
breast
far
enough
down
to
give
him
grave
apprehension
of
his
life
the
hole
made
by
the
bullet
bled
freely
both
at
its
entrance
and
where
it
had
come
out
but
with
no
signs
of
hemorrhage
he
did
not
bleed
at
the
mouth
however
he
began
to
cough
up
a
foam
as
they
rode
on
jennie
with
pale
face
and
mute
lips
looked
at
him
badly
hurt
jennie
he
said
i
guess
i
stick
it
woman
did
she
shoot
you
she
was
a
devil
euchre
told
me
to
look
out
for
her
i
quick
did
have
to
to
shivered
the
girl
no
he
replied
they
did
not
stop
climbing
while
duane
tore
a
scarf
and
made
compresses
which
he
bound
tightly
over
his
wounds
the
fresh
horses
made
fast
time
up
the
rough
trail
from
open
places
duane
looked
down
when
they
surmounted
the
steep
ascent
and
stood
on
top
of
the
rim
rock
with
no
signs
of
pursuit
down
in
the
valley
and
with
the
wild
broken
fastnesses
before
them
duane
turned
to
the
girl
and
assured
her
that
they
now
had
every
chance
of
escape
your
wound
she
faltered
with
dark
troubled
eyes
see
the
blood
dripping
from
your
back
i
take
a
lot
of
killing
he
said
then
he
became
silent
and
attended
to
the
uneven
trail
he
was
aware
presently
that
he
had
not
come
into
bland
camp
by
this
route
but
that
did
not
matter
any
trail
leading
out
beyond
the
rim
rock
was
safe
enough
what
he
wanted
was
to
get
far
away
into
some
wild
retreat
where
he
could
hide
till
he
recovered
from
his
wound
he
seemed
to
feel
a
fire
inside
his
breast
and
his
throat
burned
so
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
take
a
swallow
of
water
every
little
while
he
began
to
suffer
considerable
pain
which
increased
as
the
hours
went
by
and
then
gave
way
to
a
numbness
from
that
time
on
he
had
need
of
his
great
strength
and
endurance
gradually
he
lost
his
steadiness
and
his
keen
sight
and
he
realized
that
if
he
were
to
meet
foes
or
if
pursuing
outlaws
should
come
up
with
him
he
could
make
only
a
poor
stand
so
he
turned
off
on
a
trail
that
appeared
seldom
traveled
soon
after
this
move
he
became
conscious
of
a
further
thickening
of
his
senses
he
felt
able
to
hold
on
to
his
saddle
for
a
while
longer
but
he
was
failing
then
he
thought
he
ought
to
advise
jennie
so
in
case
she
was
left
alone
she
would
have
some
idea
of
what
to
do
i
give
out
soon
he
said
do
mean
what
you
think
but
i
drop
soon
my
strength
going
if
i
die
you
ride
back
to
the
main
trail
hide
and
rest
by
day
ride
at
night
that
trail
goes
to
water
i
believe
you
could
get
across
the
nueces
where
some
rancher
will
take
you
duane
could
not
get
the
meaning
of
her
incoherent
reply
he
rode
on
and
soon
he
could
not
see
the
trail
or
hear
his
horse
he
did
not
know
whether
they
traveled
a
mile
or
many
times
that
far
but
he
was
conscious
when
the
horse
stopped
and
had
a
vague
sense
of
falling
and
feeling
jennie
arms
before
all
became
dark
to
him
when
consciousness
returned
he
found
himself
lying
in
a
little
hut
of
mesquite
branches
it
was
well
built
and
evidently
some
years
old
there
were
two
doors
or
openings
one
in
front
and
the
other
at
the
back
duane
imagined
it
had
been
built
by
a
fugitive
one
who
meant
to
keep
an
eye
both
ways
and
not
to
be
surprised
duane
felt
weak
and
had
no
desire
to
move
where
was
he
anyway
a
strange
intangible
sense
of
time
distance
of
something
far
behind
weighed
upon
him
sight
of
the
two
packs
euchre
had
made
brought
his
thought
to
jennie
what
had
become
of
her
there
was
evidence
of
her
work
in
a
smoldering
fire
and
a
little
blackened
probably
she
was
outside
looking
after
the
horses
or
getting
water
he
thought
he
heard
a
step
and
listened
but
he
felt
tired
and
presently
his
eyes
closed
and
he
fell
into
a
doze
awakening
from
this
he
saw
jennie
sitting
beside
him
in
some
way
she
seemed
to
have
changed
when
he
spoke
she
gave
a
start
and
turned
eagerly
to
him
she
cried
how
you
jennie
and
how
am
i
he
said
finding
it
a
little
difficult
to
talk
i
all
right
she
replied
you
come
to
your
healed
but
you
been
sick
fever
i
guess
i
did
all
i
duane
saw
now
that
the
difference
in
her
was
a
whiteness
and
tightness
of
skin
a
hollowness
of
eye
a
look
of
strain
how
long
have
we
been
here
he
asked
she
took
some
pebbles
from
the
crown
of
his
sombrero
and
counted
them
nine
days
she
answered
days
he
exclaimed
incredulously
but
another
look
at
her
assured
him
that
she
meant
what
she
said
been
sick
all
the
time
you
nursed
me
men
did
come
along
here
are
the
horses
keep
them
grazing
down
in
a
gorge
back
of
here
there
good
grass
and
you
slept
any
little
lately
i
could
keep
lord
i
should
think
not
you
had
a
time
of
it
sitting
here
day
and
night
nursing
me
watching
for
the
outlaws
come
tell
me
all
about
nothing
much
to
want
to
know
anyway
just
what
you
did
how
you
ca
remember
very
well
she
replied
simply
must
have
ridden
forty
miles
that
day
we
got
away
you
bled
all
the
time
toward
evening
you
lay
on
your
horse
neck
when
we
came
to
this
place
you
fell
out
of
the
saddle
i
dragged
you
in
here
and
stopped
your
bleeding
i
thought
you
die
that
night
but
in
the
morning
i
had
a
little
hope
i
had
forgotten
the
horses
but
luckily
they
did
stray
far
i
caught
them
and
kept
them
down
in
the
gorge
when
your
wounds
closed
and
you
began
to
breathe
stronger
i
thought
you
get
well
quick
it
was
fever
that
put
you
back
you
raved
a
lot
and
that
worried
me
because
i
stop
you
anybody
trailing
us
could
have
heard
you
a
good
ways
i
know
whether
i
was
scared
most
then
or
when
you
were
quiet
and
it
was
so
dark
and
lonely
and
still
all
around
every
day
i
put
a
stone
in
your
you
saved
my
life
said
duane
do
know
maybe
i
did
all
i
knew
how
to
do
she
replied
saved
mine
more
than
my
their
eyes
met
in
a
long
gaze
and
then
their
hands
in
a
close
clasp
we
going
to
get
away
he
said
with
gladness
be
well
in
a
few
days
you
do
know
how
strong
i
am
we
hide
by
day
and
travel
by
night
i
can
get
you
across
the
then
she
asked
find
some
honest
then
she
persisted
he
began
slowly
as
far
as
my
thoughts
ever
got
it
was
pretty
hard
i
tell
you
to
assure
myself
of
so
much
it
means
your
safety
you
tell
your
story
you
be
sent
to
some
village
or
town
and
taken
care
of
until
a
relative
or
friend
is
you
she
inquired
in
a
strange
voice
duane
kept
silence
will
you
do
she
went
on
i
go
back
to
the
brakes
i
dare
show
my
face
among
respectable
people
i
an
no
criminal
she
declared
with
deep
passion
on
this
border
the
little
difference
between
an
out
law
and
a
criminal
does
count
for
wo
go
back
among
those
terrible
men
you
with
your
gentleness
and
sweetness
all
that
good
about
you
oh
duane
do
do
go
ca
go
back
to
the
outlaws
at
least
not
bland
band
no
i
go
alone
i
it
as
they
say
on
the
border
what
else
can
i
do
jennie
i
do
know
could
you
hide
could
you
slip
out
of
texas
go
far
away
could
never
get
out
of
texas
without
being
arrested
i
could
hide
but
a
man
must
live
never
mind
about
me
in
three
days
duane
was
able
with
great
difficulty
to
mount
his
horse
during
daylight
by
short
relays
he
and
jennie
rode
back
to
the
main
trail
where
they
hid
again
till
he
had
rested
then
in
the
dark
they
rode
out
of
the
canyons
and
gullies
of
the
rim
rock
and
early
in
the
morning
halted
at
the
first
water
to
camp
from
that
point
they
traveled
after
nightfall
and
went
into
hiding
during
the
day
once
across
the
nueces
river
duane
was
assured
of
safety
for
her
and
great
danger
for
himself
they
had
crossed
into
a
country
he
did
not
know
somewhere
east
of
the
river
there
were
scattered
ranches
but
he
was
as
liable
to
find
the
rancher
in
touch
with
the
outlaws
as
he
was
likely
to
find
him
honest
duane
hoped
his
good
fortune
would
not
desert
him
in
this
last
service
to
jennie
next
to
the
worry
of
that
was
realization
of
his
condition
he
had
gotten
up
too
soon
he
had
ridden
too
far
and
hard
and
now
he
felt
that
any
moment
he
might
fall
from
his
saddle
at
last
far
ahead
over
a
barren
stretch
of
dusty
ground
he
espied
a
patch
of
green
and
a
little
flat
red
he
headed
his
horse
for
it
and
turned
a
face
he
tried
to
make
cheerful
for
jennie
sake
she
seemed
both
happy
and
sorry
when
near
at
hand
he
saw
that
the
rancher
was
a
thrifty
farmer
and
thrift
spoke
for
honesty
there
were
fields
of
alfalfa
corrals
windmill
pumps
all
surrounding
a
neat
little
adobe
house
some
children
were
playing
in
the
yard
the
way
they
ran
at
sight
of
duane
hinted
of
both
the
loneliness
and
the
fear
of
their
isolated
lives
duane
saw
a
woman
come
to
the
door
then
a
man
the
latter
looked
keenly
then
stepped
outside
he
was
a
freckled
texan
stranger
he
called
as
duane
halted
down
you
an
your
woman
say
now
air
you
sick
or
shot
or
what
let
me
duane
reeling
in
his
saddle
bent
searching
eyes
upon
the
rancher
he
thought
he
saw
good
will
kindness
honesty
he
risked
all
on
that
one
sharp
glance
then
he
almost
plunged
from
the
saddle
the
rancher
caught
him
helped
him
to
a
bench
come
out
here
he
called
man
sick
no
he
shot
or
i
do
know
jennie
had
slipped
off
her
horse
and
to
duane
side
duane
appeared
about
to
faint
you
his
wife
asked
the
rancher
i
only
a
girl
he
saved
from
outlaws
oh
he
so
paler
duane
duane

exclaimed
the
rancher
excitedly

killed
bland
an
alloway

i
owe
him
a
good
turn
an
i
pay
it
young
the
rancher
wife
came
out
and
with
a
manner
at
once
kind
and
practical
essayed
to
make
duane
drink
from
a
flask
he
was
not
so
far
gone
that
he
could
not
recognize
its
contents
which
he
refused
and
weakly
asked
for
water
when
that
was
given
him
he
found
his
voice
i
duane
i
only
overdone
myself
just
all
in
the
wounds
i
got
at
bland
are
healing
will
you
take
this
girl
in
hide
her
awhile
till
the
excitement
over
among
the
outlaws
shore
will
replied
the
texan
i
remember
you
i
square
you
goin
to
do
rest
a
bit
then
go
back
to
the
man

both
of
you

my
nearest
neighbor

five
miles
off
we
do

much
risk
a
great
deal
both
outlaws
and
rangers
are
hunting

said
duane
seen
a
ranger
yet
in
these
parts
an
have
always
got
along
with
outlaws
mebbe
exceptin
bland
i
tell
you
i
owe
you
a
good
horses

betray
you
added
duane
hide
them
in
a
place
where
there
water
an
grass
nobody
goes
to
it
come
now
let
me
help
you
duane
last
fading
sensations
of
that
hard
day
were
the
strange
feel
of
a
bed
a
relief
at
the
removal
of
his
heavy
boots
and
of
jennie
soft
cool
hands
on
his
hot
face
he
lay
ill
for
three
weeks
before
he
began
to
mend
and
it
was
another
week
then
before
he
could
walk
out
a
little
in
the
dusk
of
the
evenings
after
that
his
strength
returned
rapidly
and
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
this
long
siege
that
he
recovered
his
spirits
during
most
of
his
illness
he
had
been
silent
moody
i
be
riding
off
soon
he
said
one
evening
ca
impose
on
this
good
man
andrews
much
longer
i
never
forget
his
kindness
his
wife
too
she
been
so
good
to
us
yes
jennie
you
and
i
will
have
to
say
very
hurry
away
she
replied
lately
jennie
had
appeared
strange
to
him
she
had
changed
from
the
girl
he
used
to
see
at
mrs
bland
house
he
took
her
reluctance
to
say
as
another
indication
of
her
regret
that
he
must
go
back
to
the
brakes
yet
somehow
it
made
him
observe
her
more
closely
she
wore
a
plain
white
dress
made
from
material
andrews
had
given
her
sleep
and
good
food
had
improved
her
if
she
had
been
pretty
out
there
in
the
outlaw
den
now
she
was
more
than
that
but
she
had
the
same
paleness
the
same
strained
look
the
same
dark
eyes
full
of
haunting
shadows
after
duane
realization
of
the
change
in
her
he
watched
her
more
with
a
growing
certainty
that
he
would
be
sorry
not
to
see
her
again
likely
we
wo
ever
see
each
other
again
he
said
strange
to
think
of
we
been
through
some
hard
days
and
i
seem
to
have
known
you
a
long
jennie
appeared
shy
almost
sad
so
duane
changed
the
subject
to
something
less
personal
andrews
returned
one
evening
from
a
several
days
trip
to
huntsville
everybody
talkie
about
how
you
cleaned
up
the
bland
outfit
he
said
important
and
full
of
news
some
exaggerated
to
what
you
told
me
but
you
shore
made
friends
on
this
side
of
the
nueces
i
reckon
there
ai
a
town
where
you
would
find
people
to
welcome
you
huntsville
you
know
is
some
divided
in
its
ideas
half
the
people
are
crooked
likely
enough
all
them
who
was
so
loud
in
praise
of
you
are
the
crookedest
for
instance
i
met
king
fisher
the
boss
outlaw
of
these
parts
well
king
thinks
he
a
decent
citizen
he
was
tellin
me
what
a
grand
job
yours
was
for
the
border
an
honest
cattlemen
now
that
bland
and
alloway
are
done
for
king
fisher
will
find
rustlin
easier
there
talk
of
hardin
movie
his
camp
over
to
bland
but
i
do
know
how
true
it
is
i
reckon
there
ai
much
to
it
in
the
past
when
a
big
outlaw
chief
went
under
his
band
almost
always
broke
up
an
scattered
there
no
one
left
who
could
run
thet
you
hear
of
any
outlaws
hunting
me
asked
duane
from
bland
outfit
is
huntin
you
thet
shore
replied
andrews
said
there
never
was
a
hoss
straddled
to
go
on
your
trail
nobody
had
any
use
for
bland
anyhow
his
men
would
be
afraid
to
trail
you
an
you
could
go
right
in
to
huntsville
where
you
be
some
popular
reckon
you
be
safe
too
except
when
some
of
them
fool
saloon
loafers
or
bad
cowpunchers
would
try
to
shoot
you
for
the
glory
in
it
them
kind
of
men
will
bob
up
everywhere
you
go
be
able
to
ride
and
take
care
of
myself
in
a
day
or
two
went
on
duane
i
go
i
like
to
talk
to
you
about
welcome
to
a
home
here
with
you
andrews
you
a
kind
man
but
i
want
jennie
to
get
farther
away
from
the
rio
grande
she
never
be
safe
here
besides
she
may
be
able
to
find
relatives
she
has
some
though
she
does
know
where
they
right
duane
whatever
you
think
best
i
reckon
now
you
better
take
her
to
some
town
go
north
an
strike
for
shelbyville
or
crockett
them
both
good
towns
i
tell
jennie
the
names
of
men
who
help
her
you
need
ride
into
town
at
place
is
nearer
and
how
far
is
it
i
reckon
about
two
days
ride
poor
stock
country
so
you
ai
liable
to
meet
rustlers
all
the
same
better
hit
the
trail
at
night
an
go
at
sunset
two
days
later
duane
and
jennie
mounted
their
horses
and
said
to
the
rancher
and
his
wife
andrews
would
not
listen
to
thanks
tell
you
i
beholden
to
you
yet
he
declared
what
can
i
do
for
you
asked
duane
may
come
along
here
again
some
down
an
come
in
then
or
you
no
friend
of
mine
i
reckon
there
ai
nothin
i
can
think
of
i
just
happen
to
remember
here
he
led
duane
out
of
earshot
of
the
women
and
went
on
in
a
whisper
i
used
to
be
got
skinned
by
a
man
named
brown
rodney
brown
he
lives
in
huntsville
an
he
my
enemy
i
never
was
much
on
fightin
or
i
fixed
him
brown
ruined
me
stole
all
i
had
he
a
hoss
cattle
thief
an
he
has
pull
enough
at
home
to
protect
him
i
reckon
i
need
say
any
this
brown
a
man
who
shot
an
outlaw
named
stevens
queried
duane
curiously
he
the
same
i
heard
thet
story
brown
swears
he
plugged
stevens
through
the
middle
but
the
outlaw
rode
off
an
nobody
ever
knew
for
stevens
died
of
that
shot
i
buried
him
said
duane
andrews
made
no
further
comment
and
the
two
men
returned
to
the
women
main
road
for
about
three
miles
then
where
it
forks
take
the
road
and
keep
on
straight
that
what
you
said
andrews
an
good
luck
to
you
both
duane
and
jennie
trotted
away
into
the
gathering
twilight
at
the
moment
an
insistent
thought
bothered
duane
both
luke
stevens
and
the
rancher
andrews
had
hinted
to
duane
to
kill
a
man
named
brown
duane
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
they
had
not
mentioned
it
let
alone
taken
for
granted
the
execution
of
the
deed
what
a
bloody
place
texas
was
men
who
robbed
and
men
who
were
robbed
both
wanted
murder
it
was
in
the
spirit
of
the
country
duane
certainly
meant
to
avoid
ever
meeting
this
rodney
brown
and
that
very
determination
showed
duane
how
dangerous
he
really
was
to
men
and
to
himself
sometimes
he
had
a
feeling
of
how
little
stood
between
his
sane
and
better
self
and
a
self
utterly
wild
and
terrible
he
reasoned
that
only
intelligence
could
save
him
only
a
thoughtful
understanding
of
his
danger
and
a
hold
upon
some
ideal
then
he
fell
into
low
conversation
with
jennie
holding
out
hopeful
views
of
her
future
and
presently
darkness
set
in
the
sky
was
overcast
with
heavy
clouds
there
was
no
air
moving
the
heat
and
oppression
threatened
storm
by
and
by
duane
could
not
see
a
rod
in
front
of
him
though
his
horse
had
no
difficulty
in
keeping
to
the
road
duane
was
bothered
by
the
blackness
of
the
night
traveling
fast
was
impossible
and
any
moment
he
might
miss
the
road
that
led
off
to
the
left
so
he
was
compelled
to
give
all
his
attention
to
peering
into
the
thick
shadows
ahead
as
good
luck
would
have
it
he
came
to
higher
ground
where
there
was
less
mesquite
and
therefore
not
such
impenetrable
darkness
and
at
this
point
he
came
to
where
the
road
split
once
headed
in
the
right
direction
he
felt
easier
in
mind
to
his
annoyance
however
a
fine
misty
rain
set
in
jennie
was
not
well
dressed
for
wet
weather
and
for
that
matter
neither
was
he
his
coat
which
in
that
dry
warm
climate
he
seldom
needed
was
tied
behind
his
saddle
and
he
put
it
on
jennie
they
traveled
on
the
rain
fell
steadily
if
anything
growing
thicker
duane
grew
uncomfortably
wet
and
chilly
jennie
however
fared
somewhat
better
by
reason
of
the
heavy
coat
the
night
passed
quickly
despite
the
discomfort
and
soon
a
gray
dismal
rainy
dawn
greeted
the
travelers
jennie
insisted
that
he
find
some
shelter
where
a
fire
could
be
built
to
dry
his
clothes
he
was
not
in
a
fit
condition
to
risk
catching
cold
in
fact
duane
teeth
were
chattering
to
find
a
shelter
in
that
barren
waste
seemed
a
futile
task
quite
unexpectedly
however
they
happened
upon
a
deserted
adobe
cabin
situated
a
little
off
the
road
not
only
did
it
prove
to
have
a
dry
interior
but
also
there
was
firewood
water
was
available
in
pools
everywhere
however
there
was
no
grass
for
the
horses
a
good
fire
and
hot
food
and
drink
changed
the
aspect
of
their
condition
as
far
as
comfort
went
and
jennie
lay
down
to
sleep
for
duane
however
there
must
be
vigilance
this
cabin
was
no
the
rain
fell
harder
all
the
time
and
the
wind
changed
to
the
north
a
norther
all
right
muttered
duane
or
three
and
he
felt
that
his
extraordinary
luck
had
not
held
out
still
one
point
favored
him
and
it
was
that
travelers
were
not
likely
to
come
along
during
the
storm
jennie
slept
while
duane
watched
the
saving
of
this
girl
meant
more
to
him
than
any
task
he
had
ever
assumed
first
it
had
been
partly
from
a
human
feeling
to
succor
an
unfortunate
woman
and
partly
a
motive
to
establish
clearly
to
himself
that
he
was
no
outlaw
lately
however
had
come
a
different
sense
a
strange
one
with
something
personal
and
warm
and
protective
in
it
as
he
looked
down
upon
her
a
slight
slender
girl
with
bedraggled
dress
and
disheveled
hair
her
face
pale
and
quiet
a
little
stern
in
sleep
and
her
long
dark
lashes
lying
on
her
cheek
he
seemed
to
see
her
fragility
her
prettiness
her
femininity
as
never
before
but
for
him
she
might
at
that
very
moment
have
been
a
broken
ruined
girl
lying
back
in
that
cabin
of
the
blands
the
fact
gave
him
a
feeling
of
his
importance
in
this
shifting
of
her
destiny
she
was
unharmed
still
young
she
would
forget
and
be
happy
she
would
live
to
be
a
good
wife
and
mother
somehow
the
thought
swelled
his
heart
his
act
as
it
had
been
was
a
noble
one
and
helped
him
to
hold
on
to
his
drifting
hopes
hardly
once
since
jennie
had
entered
into
his
thought
had
those
ghosts
returned
to
torment
him
she
would
be
gone
among
good
kind
people
with
a
possibility
of
finding
her
relatives
he
thanked
god
for
that
nevertheless
he
felt
a
pang
she
slept
more
than
half
the
day
duane
kept
guard
always
alert
whether
he
was
sitting
standing
or
walking
the
rain
pattered
steadily
on
the
roof
and
sometimes
came
in
gusty
flurries
through
the
door
the
horses
were
outside
in
a
shed
that
afforded
poor
shelter
and
they
stamped
restlessly
duane
kept
them
saddled
and
bridled
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
jennie
awoke
they
cooked
a
meal
and
afterward
sat
beside
the
little
fire
she
had
never
been
in
his
observation
of
her
anything
but
a
tragic
figure
an
unhappy
girl
the
farthest
removed
from
serenity
and
poise
that
characteristic
capacity
for
agitation
struck
him
as
stronger
in
her
this
day
he
attributed
it
however
to
the
long
strain
the
suspense
nearing
an
end
yet
sometimes
when
her
eyes
were
on
him
she
did
not
seem
to
be
thinking
of
her
freedom
of
her
future
time
you
be
in
shelbyville
he
said
will
you
be
she
asked
quickly
oh
i
be
making
tracks
for
some
lonesome
place
he
replied
the
girl
shuddered
been
brought
up
in
texas
i
remember
what
a
hard
lot
the
men
of
my
family
had
but
poor
as
they
were
they
had
a
roof
over
their
heads
a
hearth
with
a
fire
a
warm
bed
somebody
to
love
them
and
you
duane
oh
my
god
what
must
your
life
be
you
must
ride
and
hide
and
watch
eternally
no
decent
food
no
pillow
no
friendly
word
no
clean
clothes
no
woman
hand
horses
guns
trails
rocks
holes
these
must
be
the
important
things
in
your
life
you
must
go
on
riding
hiding
killing
until
you
meet
she
ended
with
a
sob
and
dropped
her
head
on
her
knees
duane
was
amazed
deeply
touched
girl
thank
you
for
that
thought
of
me
he
said
with
a
tremor
in
his
voice
do
know
how
much
that
means
to
she
raised
her
face
and
it
was
eloquent
beautiful
heard
tell
the
best
of
men
go
to
the
bad
out
there
you
wo
promise
me
you
wo
i
never
knew
any
man
like
you
i
i
we
may
never
see
each
other
again
after
i
never
forget
you
pray
for
you
and
i
never
give
up
trying
to
to
do
something
despair
it
never
too
late
it
was
my
hope
that
kept
me
alive
out
there
at
bland
before
you
came
i
was
only
a
poor
weak
girl
but
if
i
could
hope
so
can
you
stay
away
from
men
be
a
lone
wolf
fight
for
your
life
stick
out
your
exile
and
maybe
some
day
then
she
lost
her
voice
duane
clasped
her
hand
and
with
feeling
as
deep
as
hers
promised
to
remember
her
words
in
her
despair
for
him
she
had
spoken
wisdom
pointed
out
the
only
course
duane
vigilance
momentarily
broken
by
emotion
had
no
sooner
reasserted
itself
than
he
discovered
the
bay
horse
the
one
jennie
rode
had
broken
his
halter
and
gone
off
the
soft
wet
earth
had
deadened
the
sound
of
his
hoofs
his
tracks
were
plain
in
the
mud
there
were
clumps
of
mesquite
in
sight
among
which
the
horse
might
have
strayed
it
turned
out
however
that
he
had
not
done
so
duane
did
not
want
to
leave
jennie
alone
in
the
cabin
so
near
the
road
so
he
put
her
up
on
his
horse
and
bade
her
follow
the
rain
had
ceased
for
the
time
being
though
evidently
the
storm
was
not
yet
over
the
tracks
led
up
a
wash
to
a
wide
flat
where
mesquite
prickly
pear
and
grew
so
thickly
that
jennie
could
not
ride
into
it
duane
was
thoroughly
concerned
he
must
have
her
horse
time
was
flying
it
would
soon
be
night
he
could
not
expect
her
to
scramble
quickly
through
that
brake
on
foot
therefore
he
decided
to
risk
leaving
her
at
the
edge
of
the
thicket
and
go
in
alone
as
he
went
in
a
sound
startled
him
was
it
the
breaking
of
a
branch
he
had
stepped
on
or
thrust
aside
he
heard
the
impatient
pound
of
his
horse
hoofs
then
all
was
quiet
still
he
listened
not
wholly
satisfied
he
was
never
satisfied
in
regard
to
safety
he
knew
too
well
that
there
never
could
be
safety
for
him
in
this
country
the
bay
horse
had
threaded
the
aisles
of
the
thicket
duane
wondered
what
had
drawn
him
there
certainly
it
had
not
been
grass
for
there
was
none
presently
he
heard
the
horse
tramping
along
and
then
he
ran
the
mud
was
deep
and
the
sharp
thorns
made
going
difficult
he
came
up
with
the
horse
and
at
the
same
moment
crossed
a
multitude
of
fresh
he
bent
lower
to
examine
them
and
was
alarmed
to
find
that
they
had
been
made
very
recently
even
since
it
had
ceased
raining
they
were
tracks
of
horses
duane
straightened
up
with
a
cautious
glance
all
around
his
instant
decision
was
to
hurry
back
to
jennie
but
he
had
come
a
goodly
way
through
the
thicket
and
it
was
impossible
to
rush
back
once
or
twice
he
imagined
he
heard
crashings
in
the
brush
but
did
not
halt
to
make
sure
certain
he
was
now
that
some
kind
of
danger
threatened
suddenly
there
came
an
unmistakable
thump
of
horses
hoofs
off
somewhere
to
the
fore
then
a
scream
rent
the
air
it
ended
abruptly
duane
leaped
forward
tore
his
way
through
the
thorny
brake
he
heard
jennie
cry
again
an
appealing
call
quickly
hushed
it
seemed
more
to
his
right
and
he
plunged
that
way
he
burst
into
a
glade
where
a
smoldering
fire
and
ground
covered
with
footprints
and
tracks
showed
that
campers
had
lately
been
rushing
across
this
he
broke
his
passage
out
to
the
open
but
he
was
too
late
his
horse
had
disappeared
jennie
was
gone
there
were
no
riders
in
sight
there
was
no
sound
there
was
a
heavy
trail
of
horses
going
north
jennie
had
been
carried
off
probably
by
outlaws
duane
realized
that
pursuit
was
out
of
the
question
that
jennie
was
lost
chapter
x
a
hundred
miles
from
the
haunts
most
familiar
with
duane
deeds
far
up
where
the
nueces
ran
a
trickling
clear
stream
between
yellow
cliffs
stood
a
small
deserted
shack
of
covered
mesquite
poles
it
had
been
made
long
ago
but
was
well
preserved
a
door
faced
the
overgrown
trail
and
another
faced
down
into
a
gorge
of
dense
thickets
on
the
border
fugitives
from
law
and
men
who
hid
in
fear
of
some
one
they
had
wronged
never
lived
in
houses
with
only
one
door
it
was
a
wild
spot
lonely
not
fit
for
human
habitation
except
for
the
outcast
he
perhaps
might
have
found
it
hard
to
leave
for
most
of
the
other
wild
nooks
in
that
barren
country
down
in
the
gorge
there
was
sweet
water
grass
all
the
year
round
cool
shady
retreats
deer
rabbits
turkeys
fruit
and
miles
and
miles
of
deep
canyon
full
of
broken
rocks
and
impenetrable
thickets
the
scream
of
the
panther
was
heard
there
the
squall
of
the
wildcat
the
cough
of
the
jaguar
innumerable
bees
buzzed
in
the
spring
blossoms
and
it
seemed
scattered
honey
to
the
winds
all
day
there
was
continuous
song
of
birds
that
of
the
loud
and
sweet
and
mocking
above
the
rest
on
clear
days
and
rare
indeed
were
cloudy
days
with
the
subsiding
of
the
wind
at
sunset
a
hush
seemed
to
fall
around
the
little
hut
mountains
stood
gradually
to
fade
with
the
shading
of
light
at
this
quiet
hour
a
man
climbed
up
out
of
the
gorge
and
sat
in
the
westward
door
of
the
hut
this
lonely
watcher
of
the
west
and
listener
to
the
silence
was
duane
and
this
hut
was
the
one
where
three
years
before
jennie
had
nursed
him
back
to
life
the
killing
of
a
man
named
sellers
and
the
combination
of
circumstances
that
had
made
the
tragedy
a
memorable
regret
had
marked
if
not
a
change
at
least
a
cessation
in
duane
activities
he
had
trailed
sellers
to
kill
him
for
the
supposed
abducting
of
jennie
he
had
trailed
him
long
after
he
had
learned
sellers
traveled
alone
duane
wanted
absolute
assurance
of
jennie
death
vague
rumors
a
few
words
here
and
there
unauthenticated
stories
were
all
duane
had
gathered
in
years
to
substantiate
his
belief
that
jennie
died
shortly
after
the
beginning
of
her
second
captivity
but
duane
did
not
know
surely
sellers
might
have
told
him
duane
expected
if
not
to
force
it
from
him
at
the
end
to
read
it
in
his
eyes
but
the
bullet
went
too
unerringly
it
locked
his
lips
and
fixed
his
eyes
after
that
meeting
duane
lay
long
at
the
ranchhouse
of
a
friend
and
when
he
recovered
from
the
wound
sellers
had
given
him
he
started
with
two
horses
and
a
pack
for
the
lonely
gorge
on
the
nueces
there
he
had
been
hidden
for
months
a
prey
to
remorse
a
dreamer
a
victim
of
phantoms
it
took
work
for
him
to
find
subsistence
in
that
rocky
fastness
and
work
action
helped
to
pass
the
hours
but
he
could
not
work
all
the
time
even
if
he
had
found
it
to
do
then
in
his
idle
moments
and
at
night
his
task
was
to
live
with
the
hell
in
his
mind
the
sunset
and
the
twilight
hour
made
all
the
rest
bearable
the
little
hut
on
the
rim
of
the
gorge
seemed
to
hold
jennie
presence
it
was
not
as
if
he
felt
her
spirit
if
it
had
been
he
would
have
been
sure
of
her
death
he
hoped
jennie
had
not
survived
her
second
misfortune
and
that
intense
hope
had
burned
into
belief
if
not
surety
upon
his
return
to
that
locality
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
to
the
hut
he
had
found
things
just
as
they
had
left
them
and
a
poor
faded
piece
of
ribbon
jennie
had
used
to
tie
around
her
bright
hair
no
wandering
outlaw
or
traveler
had
happened
upon
the
lonely
spot
which
further
endeared
it
to
duane
a
strange
feature
of
this
memory
of
jennie
was
the
freshness
of
it
the
failure
of
years
toil
strife
to
dim
it
to
deaden
the
thought
of
what
might
have
been
he
had
a
marvelous
gift
of
visualization
he
could
shut
his
eyes
and
see
jennie
before
him
just
as
clearly
as
if
she
had
stood
there
in
the
flesh
for
hours
he
did
that
dreaming
dreaming
of
life
he
had
never
tasted
and
now
never
would
taste
he
saw
jennie
slender
graceful
figure
the
old
brown
ragged
dress
in
which
he
had
seen
her
first
at
bland
her
little
feet
in
mexican
sandals
her
fine
hands
coarsened
by
work
her
round
arms
and
swelling
throat
and
her
pale
sad
beautiful
face
with
its
staring
dark
eyes
he
remembered
every
look
she
had
given
him
every
word
she
had
spoken
to
him
every
time
she
had
touched
him
he
thought
of
her
beauty
and
sweetness
of
the
few
things
which
had
come
to
mean
to
him
that
she
must
have
loved
him
and
he
trained
himself
to
think
of
these
in
preference
to
her
life
at
bland
the
escape
with
him
and
then
her
recapture
because
such
memories
led
to
bitter
fruitless
pain
he
had
to
fight
suffering
because
it
was
eating
out
his
heart
sitting
there
eyes
wide
open
he
dreamed
of
the
old
homestead
and
his
mother
he
saw
the
old
home
life
sweetened
and
filled
by
dear
new
faces
and
added
joys
go
on
before
his
eyes
with
him
a
part
of
it
then
in
the
inevitable
reaction
in
the
reflux
of
bitter
reality
he
would
send
out
a
voiceless
cry
no
less
poignant
because
it
was
silent
fool
no
i
shall
never
see
mother
again
never
go
home
never
have
a
home
i
am
duane
the
lone
wolf
oh
god
i
wish
it
were
over
these
dreams
torture
me
what
have
i
to
do
with
a
mother
a
home
a
wife
no
boy
no
girl
will
ever
love
me
i
am
an
outlaw
an
outcast
dead
to
the
good
and
decent
world
i
am
alone
alone
better
be
a
callous
brute
or
better
dead
i
shall
go
mad
thinking
man
what
is
left
to
you
a
like
a
wolf
lonely
silent
days
lonely
nights
with
phantoms
or
the
trail
and
the
road
with
their
bloody
tracks
and
then
the
hard
ride
the
sleepless
hungry
ride
to
some
hole
in
rocks
or
brakes
what
hellish
thing
drives
me
why
i
end
it
all
what
is
left
only
that
damned
unquenchable
spirit
of
the
to
live
to
hang
on
to
miserable
life
to
have
no
fear
of
death
yet
to
cling
like
a
leach
to
die
as
seldom
die
with
boots
off
bain
you
were
first
and
you
long
avenged
change
with
you
and
sellers
you
were
last
and
you
avenged
and
you
others
you
avenged
lie
quiet
in
your
graves
and
give
me
peace
but
they
did
not
lie
quiet
in
their
graves
and
give
him
peace
a
group
of
specters
trooped
out
of
the
shadows
of
dusk
and
gathering
round
him
escorted
him
to
his
bed
when
duane
had
been
riding
the
trails
to
escape
pursuers
or
in
his
search
the
constant
action
and
toil
and
exhaustion
made
him
sleep
but
when
in
hiding
as
time
passed
gradually
he
required
less
rest
and
sleep
and
his
mind
became
more
active
little
by
little
his
phantoms
gained
hold
on
him
and
at
length
but
for
the
saving
power
of
his
dreams
they
would
have
claimed
him
utterly
how
many
times
he
had
said
to
himself
am
an
intelligent
man
not
crazy
i
in
full
possession
of
my
faculties
all
this
is
fancy
imagination
conscience
i
no
work
no
duty
no
ideal
no
hope
and
my
mind
is
obsessed
thronged
with
images
and
these
images
naturally
are
of
the
men
with
whom
i
have
dealt
i
ca
forget
them
they
come
back
to
me
hour
after
hour
and
when
my
tortured
mind
grows
weak
then
maybe
i
not
just
right
till
the
mood
wears
out
and
lets
me
so
he
reasoned
as
he
lay
down
in
his
comfortable
camp
the
night
was
above
the
darkly
shadowing
down
between
them
the
insects
hummed
and
chirped
and
thrummed
a
continuous
thick
song
low
and
monotonous
water
splashed
softly
over
stones
in
the
from
far
down
the
canyon
came
the
mournful
hoot
of
an
owl
the
moment
he
lay
down
thereby
giving
up
action
for
the
day
all
these
things
weighed
upon
him
like
a
great
heavy
mantle
of
loneliness
in
truth
they
did
not
constitute
loneliness
and
he
could
no
more
have
dispelled
thought
than
he
could
have
reached
out
to
touch
a
cold
bright
star
he
wondered
how
many
outcasts
like
him
lay
under
this
velvety
sky
across
the
fifteen
hundred
miles
of
wild
country
between
el
paso
and
the
mouth
of
the
river
a
vast
wild
territory
a
refuge
for
outlaws
somewhere
he
had
heard
or
read
that
the
texas
rangers
kept
a
book
with
names
and
records
of
outlaws
three
thousand
known
outlaws
yet
these
could
scarcely
be
half
of
that
unfortunate
horde
which
had
been
recruited
from
all
over
the
states
duane
had
traveled
from
camp
to
camp
den
to
den
to
and
he
knew
these
men
most
of
them
were
hopeless
criminals
some
were
avengers
a
few
were
wronged
wanderers
and
among
them
occasionally
was
a
man
human
in
his
way
honest
as
he
could
be
not
yet
lost
to
good
but
all
of
them
were
akin
in
one
sense
their
outlawry
and
that
starry
night
they
lay
with
their
dark
faces
up
some
in
packs
like
wolves
others
alone
like
the
gray
wolf
who
knew
no
mate
it
did
not
make
much
difference
in
duane
thought
of
them
that
the
majority
were
steeped
in
crime
and
brutality
more
often
than
not
stupid
from
rum
incapable
of
a
fine
feeling
just
lost
wild
dogs
duane
doubted
that
there
was
a
man
among
them
who
did
not
realize
his
moral
wreck
and
ruin
he
had
met
poor
half
witted
wretches
who
knew
it
he
believed
he
could
enter
into
their
minds
and
feel
the
truth
of
all
their
lives
the
hardened
outlaw
coarse
ignorant
bestial
who
murdered
as
bill
black
had
murdered
who
stole
for
the
sake
of
stealing
who
craved
money
to
gamble
and
drink
defiantly
ready
for
death
and
like
that
terrible
outlaw
helm
who
cried
out
on
the
scaffold
her
rip
the
wild
youngsters
seeking
notoriety
and
reckless
adventure
the
cowboys
with
a
notch
on
their
guns
with
boastful
pride
in
the
knowledge
that
they
were
marked
by
rangers
the
crooked
men
from
the
north
defaulters
forgers
murderers
all
men
not
fit
for
that
wilderness
and
not
surviving
the
dishonest
cattlemen
hand
and
glove
with
outlaws
driven
from
their
homes
the
old
grizzled
genuine
rustlers
all
these
duane
had
come
in
contact
with
had
watched
and
known
and
as
he
felt
with
them
he
seemed
to
see
that
as
their
lives
were
bad
sooner
or
later
to
end
dismally
or
tragically
so
they
must
pay
some
kind
of
earthly
penalty
if
not
of
conscience
then
of
fear
if
not
of
fear
then
of
that
most
terrible
of
all
things
to
restless
active
men
pain
the
pang
of
flesh
and
bone
duane
knew
for
he
had
seen
them
pay
best
of
all
moreover
he
knew
the
internal
life
of
the
of
that
select
but
by
no
means
small
class
of
which
he
was
representative
the
world
that
judged
him
and
his
kind
judged
him
as
a
machine
a
with
only
mind
enough
to
hunt
to
meet
to
slay
another
man
it
had
taken
three
endless
years
for
duane
to
understand
his
own
father
duane
knew
beyond
all
doubt
that
the
like
bland
like
alloway
like
sellers
men
who
were
evil
and
had
no
remorse
no
spiritual
accusing
nemesis
had
something
far
more
torturing
to
mind
more
haunting
more
murderous
of
rest
and
sleep
and
peace
and
that
something
was
abnormal
fear
of
death
duane
knew
this
for
he
had
shot
these
men
he
had
seen
the
quick
dark
shadow
in
eyes
the
presentiment
that
the
will
could
not
control
and
then
the
horrible
certainty
these
men
must
have
been
in
agony
at
every
meeting
with
a
possible
or
certain
foe
more
agony
than
the
hot
rend
of
a
bullet
they
were
haunted
too
haunted
by
this
fear
by
every
victim
calling
from
the
grave
that
nothing
was
so
inevitable
as
death
which
lurked
behind
every
corner
hid
in
every
shadow
lay
deep
in
the
dark
tube
of
every
gun
these
men
could
not
have
a
friend
they
could
not
love
or
trust
a
woman
they
knew
their
one
chance
of
holding
on
to
life
lay
in
their
own
distrust
watchfulness
dexterity
and
that
hope
by
the
very
nature
of
their
lives
could
not
be
lasting
they
had
doomed
themselves
what
then
could
possibly
have
dwelt
in
the
depths
of
their
minds
as
they
went
to
their
beds
on
a
starry
night
like
this
with
mystery
in
silence
and
shadow
with
time
passing
surely
and
the
dark
future
and
its
secret
approaching
every
hour
what
then
but
hell
the
hell
in
duane
mind
was
not
fear
of
man
or
fear
of
death
he
would
have
been
glad
to
lay
down
the
burden
of
life
providing
death
came
naturally
many
times
he
had
prayed
for
it
but
that
overdeveloped
superhuman
spirit
of
defense
in
him
precluded
suicide
or
the
inviting
of
an
enemy
bullet
sometimes
he
had
a
vague
scarcely
analyzed
idea
that
this
spirit
was
what
had
made
the
southwest
habitable
for
the
white
man
every
one
of
his
victims
singly
and
collectively
returned
to
him
for
ever
it
seemed
in
cold
passionless
accusing
domination
of
these
haunted
hours
they
did
not
accuse
him
of
dishonor
or
cowardice
or
brutality
or
murder
they
only
accused
him
of
death
it
was
as
if
they
knew
more
than
when
they
were
alive
had
learned
that
life
was
a
divine
mysterious
gift
not
to
be
taken
they
thronged
about
him
with
their
voiceless
clamoring
drifted
around
him
with
their
fading
eyes
chapter
xi
after
nearly
six
months
in
the
nueces
gorge
the
loneliness
and
inaction
of
his
life
drove
duane
out
upon
the
trails
seeking
anything
rather
than
to
hide
longer
alone
a
prey
to
the
scourge
of
his
thoughts
the
moment
he
rode
into
sight
of
men
a
remarkable
transformation
occurred
in
him
a
strange
warmth
stirred
in
him
a
longing
to
see
the
faces
of
people
to
hear
their
voices
a
pleasurable
emotion
sad
and
strange
but
it
was
only
a
precursor
of
his
old
bitter
sleepless
and
eternal
vigilance
when
he
hid
alone
in
the
brakes
he
was
safe
from
all
except
his
deeper
better
self
when
he
escaped
from
this
into
the
haunts
of
men
his
force
and
will
went
to
the
preservation
of
his
life
mercer
was
the
first
village
he
rode
into
he
had
many
friends
there
mercer
claimed
to
owe
duane
a
debt
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
there
was
a
grave
overgrown
by
brush
so
that
the
post
which
marked
it
was
scarcely
visible
to
duane
as
he
rode
by
he
had
never
read
the
inscription
but
he
thought
now
of
hardin
no
other
than
the
erstwhile
ally
of
bland
for
many
years
hardin
had
harassed
the
stockmen
and
ranchers
in
and
around
mercer
on
an
evil
day
for
him
he
or
his
outlaws
had
beaten
and
robbed
a
man
who
once
succored
duane
when
sore
in
need
duane
met
hardin
in
the
little
plaza
of
the
village
called
him
every
name
known
to
border
men
taunted
him
to
draw
and
killed
him
in
the
act
duane
went
to
the
house
of
one
jones
a
texan
who
had
known
his
father
and
there
he
was
warmly
received
the
feel
of
an
honest
hand
the
voice
of
a
friend
the
prattle
of
children
who
were
not
afraid
of
him
or
his
gun
good
wholesome
food
and
change
of
clothes
these
things
for
the
time
being
made
a
changed
man
of
duane
to
be
sure
he
did
not
often
speak
the
price
of
his
head
and
the
weight
of
his
burden
made
him
silent
but
eagerly
he
drank
in
all
the
news
that
was
told
him
in
the
years
of
his
absence
from
home
he
had
never
heard
a
word
about
his
mother
or
uncle
those
who
were
his
real
friends
on
the
border
would
have
been
the
last
to
make
inquiries
to
write
or
receive
letters
that
might
give
a
clue
to
duane
whereabouts
duane
remained
all
day
with
this
hospitable
jones
and
as
twilight
fell
was
loath
to
go
and
yielded
to
a
pressing
invitation
to
remain
overnight
it
was
seldom
indeed
that
duane
slept
under
a
roof
early
in
the
evening
while
duane
sat
on
the
porch
with
two
awed
and
sons
of
the
house
jones
returned
from
a
quick
visit
down
to
the
summarily
he
sent
the
boys
off
he
labored
under
intense
excitement
there
rangers
in
town
he
whispered
all
over
town
too
that
you
here
you
rode
in
long
after
sunup
lots
of
people
saw
you
i
do
believe
there
a
man
or
boy
that
squeal
on
you
but
the
women
might
they
gossip
and
these
rangers
are
handsome
fellows
devils
with
the
company
of
rangers
asked
duane
quickly
a
under
captain
macnelly
that
new
ranger
he
made
a
big
name
in
the
war
and
since
he
been
in
the
ranger
service
he
done
wonders
he
cleaned
up
some
bad
places
south
and
he
working
i
heard
of
him
describe
him
to
chap
but
wiry
and
tough
clean
face
black
mustache
and
hair
sharp
black
eyes
he
got
a
look
of
authority
macnelly
a
fine
man
duane
belongs
to
a
good
southern
family
i
hate
to
have
him
look
you
duane
did
not
speak
got
nerve
and
his
rangers
are
all
experienced
men
if
they
find
out
you
here
they
come
after
you
macnelly
no
but
he
would
hesitate
to
do
his
duty
even
if
he
faced
sure
death
which
he
would
in
this
case
duane
you
must
meet
captain
macnelly
your
record
is
clean
if
it
is
terrible
you
never
met
a
ranger
or
any
officer
except
a
rotten
sheriff
now
and
then
like
rod
still
duane
kept
silence
he
was
not
thinking
of
danger
but
of
the
fact
of
how
fleeting
must
be
his
stay
among
friends
already
fixed
up
a
pack
of
grub
went
on
jones
slip
out
to
saddle
your
horse
you
watch
he
had
scarcely
uttered
the
last
word
when
soft
swift
footsteps
sounded
on
the
hard
path
a
man
turned
in
at
the
gate
the
light
was
dim
yet
clean
enough
to
disclose
an
unusually
tall
figure
when
it
appeared
nearer
he
was
seen
to
be
walking
with
both
arms
raised
hands
high
he
slowed
his
stride
burt
jones
live
here
he
asked
in
a
low
hurried
voice
reckon
i
burt
what
can
i
do
for
you
replied
jones
the
stranger
peered
around
stealthily
came
closer
still
with
his
hands
up
is
known
that
buck
duane
is
here
captain
macnelly
camping
on
the
river
just
out
of
town
he
sends
word
to
duane
to
come
out
there
after
the
stranger
wheeled
and
departed
as
swiftly
and
strangely
as
he
had
come
me
duane
whatever
do
you
make
of
that
exclaimed
jones
new
one
on
me
replied
duane
thoughtfully
fool
thing
i
ever
heard
of
macnelly
doing
ca
make
head
nor
tails
of
it
i
have
said
offhand
that
macnelly
would
anybody
he
struck
me
as
a
square
man
sand
all
through
but
hell
he
must
mean
treachery
i
ca
see
anything
else
in
that
the
captain
wants
to
give
me
a
fair
chance
to
surrender
without
bloodshed
observed
duane
decent
of
him
if
he
meant
invites
you
out
to
his
camp
after
dark
something
strange
about
this
duane
but
macnelly
a
new
man
out
here
he
does
some
queer
things
perhaps
he
getting
a
swelled
head
well
whatever
his
intentions
his
presence
around
mercer
is
enough
for
us
duane
you
hit
the
road
and
put
some
miles
between
you
the
amiable
captain
before
daylight
i
go
out
there
and
ask
him
what
in
the
devil
he
messenger
he
sent
he
was
a
ranger
said
duane
he
was
and
a
nervy
one
it
must
have
taken
sand
to
come
bracing
you
that
way
duane
the
fellow
did
pack
a
gun
i
swear
to
that
pretty
odd
this
trick
but
you
ca
trust
it
hit
the
road
a
little
later
a
black
horse
with
muffled
hoofs
bearing
a
tall
dark
rider
who
peered
keenly
into
every
shadow
trotted
down
a
pasture
lane
back
of
jones
house
turned
into
the
road
and
then
breaking
into
swifter
gait
rapidly
left
mercer
behind
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
out
duane
drew
rein
in
a
forest
of
mesquite
dismounted
and
searched
about
for
a
glade
with
a
little
grass
here
he
staked
his
horse
on
a
long
lariat
and
using
his
saddle
for
a
pillow
his
for
covering
he
went
to
sleep
next
morning
he
was
off
again
working
south
during
the
next
few
days
he
paid
brief
visits
to
several
villages
that
lay
in
his
path
and
in
each
some
one
particular
friend
had
a
piece
of
news
to
impart
that
made
duane
profoundly
thoughtful
a
ranger
had
made
a
quiet
unobtrusive
call
upon
these
friends
and
left
this
message
buck
duane
to
ride
into
captain
macnelly
camp
some
time
after
duane
concluded
and
his
friends
all
agreed
with
him
that
the
new
ranger
main
purpose
in
the
nueces
country
was
to
capture
or
kill
buck
duane
and
that
this
message
was
simply
an
original
and
striking
ruse
the
daring
of
which
might
appeal
to
certain
outlaws
but
it
did
not
appeal
to
duane
his
curiosity
was
aroused
it
did
not
however
tempt
him
to
any
foolhardy
act
he
turned
southwest
and
rode
a
hundred
miles
until
he
again
reached
the
sparsely
settled
country
here
he
heard
no
more
of
rangers
it
was
a
barren
region
he
had
never
but
once
ridden
through
and
that
ride
had
cost
him
dear
he
had
been
compelled
to
shoot
his
way
out
outlaws
were
not
in
accord
with
the
few
ranchers
and
their
cowboys
who
ranged
there
he
learned
that
both
outlaws
and
mexican
raiders
had
long
been
at
bitter
enmity
with
these
ranchers
being
unfamiliar
with
roads
and
trails
duane
had
pushed
on
into
the
heart
of
this
district
when
all
the
time
he
really
believed
he
was
traveling
around
it
a
from
a
a
deliberate
attempt
to
kill
him
because
he
was
an
unknown
rider
in
those
parts
discovered
to
duane
his
mistake
and
a
hard
ride
to
get
away
persuaded
him
to
return
to
his
old
methods
of
hiding
by
day
and
traveling
by
night
he
got
into
rough
country
rode
for
three
days
without
covering
much
ground
but
believed
that
he
was
getting
on
safer
territory
twice
he
came
to
a
wide
green
with
willow
and
cottonwood
and
thick
as
chaparral
somewhere
through
the
middle
of
which
ran
a
river
he
decided
must
be
the
lower
nueces
one
evening
as
he
stole
out
from
a
covert
where
he
had
camped
he
saw
the
lights
of
a
village
he
tried
to
pass
it
on
the
left
but
was
unable
to
because
the
brakes
of
this
extended
in
almost
to
the
outskirts
of
the
village
and
he
had
to
retrace
his
steps
and
go
round
to
the
right
wire
fences
and
horses
in
pasture
made
this
a
task
so
it
was
well
after
midnight
before
he
accomplished
it
he
made
ten
miles
or
more
then
by
daylight
and
after
that
proceeded
cautiously
along
a
road
which
appeared
to
be
well
worn
from
travel
he
passed
several
thickets
where
he
would
have
halted
to
hide
during
the
day
but
for
the
fact
that
he
had
to
find
water
he
was
a
long
while
in
coming
to
it
and
then
there
was
no
thicket
or
clump
of
mesquite
near
the
waterhole
that
would
afford
him
covert
so
he
kept
on
the
country
before
him
was
ridgy
and
began
to
show
cottonwoods
here
and
there
in
the
hollows
and
yucca
and
mesquite
on
the
higher
ground
as
he
mounted
a
ridge
he
noted
that
the
road
made
a
sharp
turn
and
he
could
not
see
what
was
beyond
it
he
slowed
up
and
was
making
the
turn
which
was
between
high
banks
of
yellow
clay
when
his
mettlesome
horse
heard
something
to
frighten
him
or
shied
at
something
and
bolted
the
few
bounds
he
took
before
duane
iron
arm
checked
him
were
enough
to
reach
the
curve
one
flashing
glance
showed
duane
the
open
once
more
a
little
valley
below
with
a
wide
shallow
rocky
stream
a
clump
of
cottonwoods
beyond
a
somber
group
of
men
facing
him
and
two
dark
limp
strangely
grotesque
figures
hanging
from
branches
the
sight
was
common
enough
in
southwest
texas
but
duane
had
never
before
found
himself
so
unpleasantly
close
a
hoarse
voice
pealed
out
hell
there
another
one
ride
down
an
account
fer
yourself
yelled
another
up
right
jack
do
take
no
chances
plug
him
these
remarks
were
so
swiftly
uttered
as
almost
to
be
continuous
duane
was
wheeling
his
horse
when
a
rifle
cracked
the
bullet
struck
his
left
forearm
and
he
thought
broke
it
for
he
dropped
the
rein
the
frightened
horse
leaped
another
bullet
whistled
past
duane
then
the
bend
in
the
road
saved
him
probably
from
certain
death
like
the
wind
his
fleet
steed
wend
down
the
long
hill
duane
was
in
no
hurry
to
look
back
he
knew
what
to
expect
his
chief
concern
of
the
moment
was
for
his
injured
arm
he
found
that
the
bones
were
still
intact
but
the
wound
having
been
made
by
a
soft
bullet
was
an
exceedingly
bad
one
blood
poured
from
it
giving
the
horse
his
head
duane
wound
his
scarf
tightly
round
the
holes
and
with
teeth
and
hand
tied
it
tightly
that
done
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
riders
were
making
the
dust
fly
on
the
hillside
road
there
were
more
coming
round
the
cut
where
the
road
curved
the
leader
was
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
back
and
the
others
strung
out
behind
him
duane
needed
only
one
glance
to
tell
him
that
they
were
fast
and
cowboys
in
a
land
where
all
riders
were
good
they
would
not
have
owned
any
but
strong
swift
horses
moreover
it
was
a
district
where
ranchers
had
suffered
beyond
all
endurance
the
greed
and
brutality
of
outlaws
duane
had
simply
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
run
right
into
a
lynching
party
at
a
time
of
all
times
when
any
stranger
would
be
in
danger
and
any
outlaw
put
to
his
limit
to
escape
with
his
life
duane
did
not
look
back
again
till
he
had
crossed
the
ridgy
piece
of
ground
and
had
gotten
to
the
level
road
he
had
gained
upon
his
pursuers
when
he
ascertained
this
he
tried
to
save
his
horse
to
check
a
little
that
killing
gait
this
horse
was
a
magnificent
animal
big
strong
fast
but
his
endurance
had
never
been
put
to
a
grueling
test
and
that
worried
duane
his
life
had
made
it
impossible
to
keep
one
horse
very
long
at
a
time
and
this
one
was
an
unknown
quantity
duane
had
only
one
plan
the
only
plan
possible
in
this
case
and
that
was
to
make
the
where
he
might
elude
his
pursuers
in
the
willow
brakes
fifteen
miles
or
so
would
bring
him
to
the
river
and
this
was
not
a
hopeless
distance
for
any
good
horse
if
not
too
closely
pressed
duane
concluded
presently
that
the
cowboys
behind
were
losing
a
little
in
the
chase
because
they
were
not
extending
their
horses
it
was
decidedly
unusual
for
such
riders
to
save
their
mounts
duane
pondered
over
this
looking
backward
several
times
to
see
if
their
horses
were
stretched
out
they
were
not
and
the
fact
was
disturbing
only
one
reason
presented
itself
to
duane
conjecturing
and
it
was
that
with
him
headed
straight
on
that
road
his
pursuers
were
satisfied
not
to
force
the
running
he
began
to
hope
and
look
for
a
trail
or
a
road
turning
off
to
right
or
left
there
was
none
a
rough
and
country
extended
away
on
either
side
duane
believed
that
he
would
be
compelled
to
take
to
this
hard
going
one
thing
was
certain
he
had
to
go
round
the
village
the
river
however
was
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
and
once
in
the
willows
he
would
be
safe
far
ahead
caused
his
alarm
to
grow
he
watched
with
his
eyes
strained
he
hoped
to
see
a
wagon
a
few
stray
cattle
but
no
he
soon
descried
several
horsemen
shots
and
yells
behind
him
attested
to
the
fact
that
his
pursuers
likewise
had
seen
these
on
the
scene
more
than
a
mile
separated
these
two
parties
yet
that
distance
did
not
keep
them
from
soon
understanding
each
other
duane
waited
only
to
see
this
new
factor
show
signs
of
sudden
quick
action
and
then
with
a
muttered
curse
he
spurred
his
horse
off
the
road
into
the
brush
he
chose
the
right
side
because
the
river
lay
nearer
that
way
there
were
patches
of
open
sandy
ground
between
clumps
of
cactus
and
mesquite
and
he
found
that
despite
a
zigzag
course
he
made
better
time
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
locate
his
pursuers
they
would
come
together
he
decided
and
take
to
his
tracks
what
then
was
his
surprise
and
dismay
to
run
out
of
a
thicket
right
into
a
low
ridge
of
rough
broken
rock
impossible
to
get
a
horse
over
he
wheeled
to
the
left
along
its
base
the
sandy
ground
gave
place
to
a
harder
soil
where
his
horse
did
not
labor
so
here
the
growths
of
mesquite
and
cactus
became
scanter
affording
better
travel
but
poor
cover
he
kept
sharp
eyes
ahead
and
as
he
had
expected
soon
saw
moving
and
the
dark
figures
of
horses
they
were
half
a
mile
away
and
swinging
obliquely
across
the
flat
which
fact
proved
that
they
had
entertained
a
fair
idea
of
the
country
and
the
difficulty
without
an
instant
hesitation
duane
put
his
horse
to
his
best
efforts
straight
ahead
he
had
to
pass
those
men
when
this
was
seemingly
made
impossible
by
a
deep
wash
from
which
he
had
to
turn
duane
began
to
feel
cold
and
sick
was
this
the
end
always
there
had
to
be
an
end
to
an
outlaw
career
he
wanted
then
to
ride
straight
at
these
pursuers
but
reason
outweighed
instinct
he
was
fleeing
for
his
life
nevertheless
the
strongest
instinct
at
the
time
was
his
desire
to
fight
he
knew
when
these
three
horsemen
saw
him
and
a
moment
afterward
he
lost
sight
of
them
as
he
got
into
the
mesquite
again
he
meant
now
to
try
to
reach
the
road
and
pushed
his
mount
severely
though
still
saving
him
for
a
final
burst
rocks
thickets
bunches
of
cactus
washes
all
operated
against
his
following
a
straight
line
almost
he
lost
his
bearings
and
finally
would
have
ridden
toward
his
enemies
had
not
good
fortune
favored
him
in
the
matter
of
an
open
stretch
of
ground
here
he
saw
both
groups
of
pursuers
one
on
each
side
and
almost
within
their
sharp
yells
as
much
as
his
cruel
spurs
drove
his
horse
into
that
pace
which
now
meant
life
or
death
for
him
and
never
had
duane
bestrode
a
gamer
swifter
stancher
beast
he
seemed
about
to
accomplish
the
impossible
in
the
dragging
sand
he
was
far
superior
to
any
horse
in
pursuit
and
on
this
sandy
open
stretch
he
gained
enough
to
spare
a
little
in
the
brush
beyond
heated
now
and
thoroughly
terrorized
he
kept
the
pace
through
thickets
that
almost
tore
duane
from
his
saddle
something
weighty
and
grim
eased
off
duane
he
was
going
to
get
out
in
front
the
horse
had
speed
fire
stamina
duane
dashed
out
into
another
open
place
dotted
by
few
trees
and
here
right
in
his
path
within
stood
horsemen
waiting
they
yelled
they
spurred
toward
him
but
did
not
fire
at
him
he
turned
his
horse
faced
to
the
right
only
one
thing
kept
him
from
standing
his
ground
to
fight
it
out
he
remembered
those
dangling
limp
figures
hanging
from
the
cottonwoods
these
ranchers
would
rather
hang
an
outlaw
than
do
anything
they
might
draw
all
his
fire
and
then
capture
him
his
horror
of
hanging
was
so
great
as
to
be
all
out
of
proportion
compared
to
his
instinct
of
a
race
began
then
a
dusty
crashing
drive
through
gray
mesquite
duane
could
scarcely
see
he
was
so
blinded
by
stinging
branches
across
his
eyes
the
hollow
wind
roared
in
his
ears
he
lost
his
sense
of
the
nearness
of
his
pursuers
but
they
must
have
been
close
did
they
shoot
at
him
he
imagined
he
heard
shots
but
that
might
have
been
the
cracking
of
dead
snags
his
left
arm
hung
limp
almost
useless
he
handled
the
rein
with
his
right
and
most
of
the
time
he
hung
low
over
the
pommel
the
gray
walls
flashing
by
him
the
whip
of
twigs
the
rush
of
wind
the
heavy
rapid
pound
of
hoofs
the
violent
motion
of
his
horse
these
vied
in
sensation
with
the
smart
of
sweat
in
his
eyes
the
rack
of
his
wound
the
cold
sick
cramp
in
his
stomach
with
these
also
was
dull
raging
fury
he
had
to
run
when
he
wanted
to
fight
it
took
all
his
mind
to
force
back
that
bitter
hate
of
himself
of
his
pursuers
of
this
race
for
his
useless
life
suddenly
he
burst
out
of
a
line
of
mesquite
into
the
road
a
long
stretch
of
lonely
road
how
fiercely
with
hot
strange
joy
he
wheeled
his
horse
upon
it
then
he
was
sweeping
along
sure
now
that
he
was
out
in
front
his
horse
still
had
strength
and
speed
but
showed
signs
of
breaking
presently
duane
looked
back
pursuers
he
could
not
count
how
many
were
loping
along
in
his
rear
he
paid
no
more
attention
to
them
and
with
teeth
set
he
faced
ahead
grimmer
now
in
his
determination
to
foil
them
he
passed
a
few
scattered
where
horses
whistled
from
corrals
and
men
curiously
watched
him
fly
past
he
saw
one
rancher
running
and
he
felt
intuitively
that
this
fellow
was
going
to
join
in
the
chase
duane
steed
pounded
on
not
noticeably
slower
but
with
a
lack
of
former
smoothness
with
a
strained
convulsive
jerking
stride
which
showed
he
was
almost
done
sight
of
the
village
ahead
surprised
duane
he
had
reached
it
sooner
than
he
expected
then
he
made
a
discovery
he
had
entered
the
zone
of
wire
fences
as
he
dared
not
turn
back
now
he
kept
on
intending
to
ride
through
the
village
looking
backward
he
saw
that
his
pursuers
were
half
a
mile
distant
too
far
to
alarm
any
villagers
in
time
to
intercept
him
in
his
flight
as
he
rode
by
the
first
houses
his
horse
broke
and
began
to
labor
duane
did
not
believe
he
would
last
long
enough
to
go
through
the
village
saddled
horses
in
front
of
a
store
gave
duane
an
idea
not
by
any
means
new
and
one
he
had
carried
out
successfully
before
as
he
pulled
in
his
heaving
mount
and
leaped
off
a
couple
of
ranchers
came
out
of
the
place
and
one
of
them
stepped
to
a
fiery
bay
he
was
about
to
get
into
his
saddle
when
he
saw
duane
and
then
he
halted
a
foot
in
the
stirrup
duane
strode
forward
grasped
the
bridle
of
this
man
horse
done
but
not
killed
he
panted
with
stranger
i
shore
always
ready
to
trade
drawled
the
man
ai
you
a
little
swift
duane
glanced
back
up
the
road
his
pursuers
were
entering
the
village
duane
buck
duane
he
cried
menacingly
you
trade
hurry
the
rancher
turning
white
dropped
his
foot
from
the
stirrup
and
fell
back
reckon
i
trade
he
said
bounding
up
duane
dug
spurs
into
the
bay
flanks
the
horse
snorted
in
fright
plunged
into
a
run
he
was
fresh
swift
half
wild
duane
flashed
by
the
remaining
houses
on
the
street
out
into
the
open
but
the
road
ended
at
that
village
or
else
led
out
from
some
other
quarter
for
he
had
ridden
straight
into
the
fields
and
from
them
into
rough
desert
when
he
reached
the
cover
of
mesquite
once
more
he
looked
back
to
find
six
horsemen
within
of
him
and
more
coming
behind
them
his
new
horse
had
not
had
time
to
get
warm
before
duane
reached
a
high
sandy
bluff
below
which
lay
the
willow
brakes
as
far
as
he
could
see
extended
an
immense
flat
strip
of
willow
how
welcome
it
was
to
his
eye
he
felt
like
a
hunted
wolf
that
weary
and
lame
had
reached
his
hole
in
the
rocks
zigzagging
down
the
soft
slope
he
put
the
bay
to
the
dense
wall
of
leaf
and
branch
but
the
horse
balked
there
was
little
time
to
lose
dismounting
he
dragged
the
stubborn
beast
into
the
thicket
this
was
harder
and
slower
work
than
duane
cared
to
risk
if
he
had
not
been
rushed
he
might
have
had
better
success
so
he
had
to
abandon
the
horse
a
circumstance
that
only
such
sore
straits
could
have
driven
him
to
then
he
went
slipping
swiftly
through
the
narrow
aisles
he
had
not
gotten
under
cover
any
too
soon
for
he
heard
his
pursuers
piling
over
the
bluff
confident
brutal
they
crashed
into
the
willows
sid
heah
your
hoss
called
one
evidently
to
the
man
duane
had
forced
into
a
trade
if
you
locoed
gents
hold
up
a
little
i
tell
you
somethin
replied
a
voice
from
the
bluff
on
sid
we
got
him
corralled
said
the
first
speaker
mebbe
an
if
you
hev
it
liable
to
be
damn
hot
thet
feller
was
buck
duane
absolute
silence
followed
that
statement
presently
it
was
broken
by
a
rattling
of
loose
gravel
and
then
low
voices
ca
git
across
the
river
i
tell
you
came
to
duane
ears
corralled
in
the
brake
i
know
thet
then
duane
gliding
silently
and
swiftly
through
the
willows
heard
no
more
from
his
pursuers
he
headed
straight
for
the
river
threading
a
passage
through
a
willow
brake
was
an
old
task
for
him
many
days
and
nights
had
gone
to
the
acquiring
of
a
skill
that
might
have
been
envied
by
an
indian
the
rio
grande
and
its
tributaries
for
the
most
of
their
length
in
texas
ran
between
wide
low
flat
lands
covered
by
a
dense
growth
of
willow
cottonwood
mesquite
prickly
pear
and
other
growths
mingled
with
the
willow
and
altogether
they
made
a
matted
tangled
copse
a
thicket
that
an
inexperienced
man
would
have
considered
impenetrable
from
above
these
wild
brakes
looked
green
and
red
from
the
inside
they
were
gray
and
yellow
a
striped
wall
trails
and
glades
were
scarce
there
were
a
few
and
sometimes
little
paths
made
by
peccaries
the
jabali
or
wild
pigs
of
mexico
the
ground
was
clay
and
unusually
dry
sometimes
baked
so
hard
that
it
left
no
imprint
of
a
track
where
a
growth
of
cottonwood
had
held
back
the
encroachment
of
the
willows
there
usually
was
thick
grass
and
underbrush
the
willows
were
short
slender
poles
with
stems
so
close
together
that
they
almost
touched
and
with
the
leafy
foliage
forming
a
thick
covering
the
depths
of
this
brake
duane
had
penetrated
was
a
silent
dreamy
strange
place
in
the
middle
of
the
day
the
light
was
weird
and
dim
when
a
breeze
fluttered
the
foliage
then
slender
shafts
and
spears
of
sunshine
pierced
the
green
mantle
and
danced
like
gold
on
the
ground
duane
had
always
felt
the
strangeness
of
this
kind
of
place
and
likewise
he
had
felt
a
protecting
harboring
something
which
always
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
sympathy
of
the
brake
for
a
hunted
creature
any
unwounded
creature
strong
and
resourceful
was
safe
when
he
had
glided
under
the
low
rustling
green
roof
of
this
wild
covert
it
was
not
hard
to
conceal
tracks
the
springy
soil
gave
forth
no
sound
and
men
could
hunt
each
other
for
weeks
pass
within
a
few
yards
of
each
other
and
never
know
it
the
problem
of
sustaining
life
was
difficult
but
then
hunted
men
and
animals
survived
on
very
little
duane
wanted
to
cross
the
river
if
that
was
possible
and
keeping
in
the
brake
work
his
way
upstream
till
he
had
reached
country
more
hospitable
remembering
what
the
man
had
said
in
regard
to
the
river
duane
had
his
doubts
about
crossing
but
he
would
take
any
chance
to
put
the
river
between
him
and
his
hunters
he
pushed
on
his
left
arm
had
to
be
favored
as
he
could
scarcely
move
it
using
his
right
to
spread
the
willows
he
slipped
sideways
between
them
and
made
fast
time
there
were
narrow
aisles
and
washes
and
holes
low
down
and
paths
brushed
by
animals
all
of
which
he
took
advantage
of
running
walking
crawling
stooping
any
way
to
get
along
to
keep
in
a
straight
line
was
not
easy
he
did
it
by
marking
some
bright
sunlit
stem
or
tree
ahead
and
when
he
reached
it
looked
straight
on
to
mark
another
his
progress
necessarily
grew
slower
for
as
he
advanced
the
brake
became
wilder
denser
darker
mosquitoes
began
to
whine
about
his
head
he
kept
on
without
pause
deepening
shadows
under
the
willows
told
him
that
the
afternoon
was
far
advanced
he
began
to
fear
he
had
wandered
in
a
wrong
direction
finally
a
strip
of
light
ahead
relieved
his
anxiety
and
after
a
toilsome
penetration
of
still
denser
brush
he
broke
through
to
the
bank
of
the
river
he
faced
a
wide
shallow
muddy
stream
with
brakes
on
the
opposite
bank
extending
like
a
green
and
yellow
wall
duane
perceived
at
a
glance
the
futility
of
his
trying
to
cross
at
this
point
everywhere
the
sluggish
water
raved
quicksand
bars
in
fact
the
bed
of
the
river
was
all
quicksand
and
very
likely
there
was
not
a
foot
of
water
anywhere
he
could
not
swim
he
could
not
crawl
he
could
not
push
a
log
across
any
solid
thing
touching
that
smooth
yellow
sand
would
be
grasped
and
sucked
down
to
prove
this
he
seized
a
long
pole
and
reaching
down
from
the
high
bank
thrust
it
into
the
stream
right
there
near
shore
there
apparently
was
no
bottom
to
the
treacherous
quicksand
he
abandoned
any
hope
of
crossing
the
river
probably
for
miles
up
and
down
it
would
be
just
the
same
as
here
before
leaving
the
bank
he
tied
his
hat
upon
the
pole
and
lifted
enough
water
to
quench
his
thirst
then
he
worked
his
way
back
to
where
thinner
growth
made
advancement
easier
and
kept
on
till
the
shadows
were
so
deep
he
could
not
see
feeling
around
for
a
place
big
enough
to
stretch
out
on
he
lay
down
for
the
time
being
he
was
as
safe
there
as
he
would
have
been
beyond
in
the
rim
rock
he
was
tired
though
not
exhausted
and
in
spite
of
the
throbbing
pain
in
his
arm
he
dropped
at
once
into
sleep
chapter
xii
some
time
during
the
night
duane
awoke
a
stillness
seemingly
so
thick
and
heavy
as
to
have
substance
blanketed
the
black
willow
brake
he
could
not
see
a
star
or
a
branch
or
or
even
his
hand
before
his
eyes
he
lay
there
waiting
listening
sure
that
he
had
been
awakened
by
an
unusual
sound
ordinary
noises
of
the
night
in
the
wilderness
never
disturbed
his
rest
his
faculties
like
those
of
old
fugitives
and
hunted
creatures
had
become
trained
to
a
marvelous
keenness
a
long
low
breath
of
slow
wind
moaned
through
the
willows
passed
away
some
stealthy
beast
trotted
by
him
in
the
darkness
there
was
a
rustling
among
dry
leaves
a
fox
barked
lonesomely
in
the
distance
but
none
of
these
sounds
had
broken
his
slumber
suddenly
piercing
the
stillness
came
a
bay
of
a
bloodhound
quickly
duane
sat
up
chilled
to
his
marrow
the
action
made
him
aware
of
his
crippled
arm
then
came
other
bays
lower
more
distant
silence
enfolded
him
again
all
the
more
oppressive
and
menacing
in
his
suspense
bloodhounds
had
been
put
on
his
trail
and
the
leader
was
not
far
away
all
his
life
duane
had
been
familiar
with
bloodhounds
and
he
knew
that
if
the
pack
surrounded
him
in
this
impenetrable
darkness
he
would
be
held
at
bay
or
dragged
down
as
wolves
dragged
a
stag
rising
to
his
feet
prepared
to
flee
as
best
he
could
he
waited
to
be
sure
of
the
direction
he
should
take
the
leader
of
the
hounds
broke
into
cry
again
a
deep
ringing
bay
strange
ominous
terribly
significant
in
its
power
it
caused
a
cold
sweat
to
ooze
out
all
over
duane
body
he
turned
from
it
and
with
his
uninjured
arm
outstretched
to
feel
for
the
willows
he
groped
his
way
along
as
it
was
impossible
to
pick
out
the
narrow
passages
he
had
to
slip
and
squeeze
and
plunge
between
the
yielding
stems
he
made
such
a
crashing
that
he
no
longer
heard
the
baying
of
the
hounds
he
had
no
hope
to
elude
them
he
meant
to
climb
the
first
cottonwood
that
he
stumbled
upon
in
his
blind
flight
but
it
appeared
he
never
was
going
to
be
lucky
enough
to
run
against
one
often
he
fell
sometimes
flat
at
others
upheld
by
the
willows
what
made
the
work
so
hard
was
the
fact
that
he
had
only
one
arm
to
open
a
clump
of
stems
and
his
feet
would
catch
or
tangle
in
the
narrow
crotches
holding
him
fast
he
had
to
struggle
desperately
it
was
as
if
the
willows
were
clutching
hands
his
enemies
fiendishly
impeding
his
progress
he
tore
his
clothes
on
sharp
branches
and
his
flesh
suffered
many
a
prick
but
in
a
terrible
earnestness
he
kept
on
until
he
brought
up
hard
against
a
cottonwood
tree
there
he
leaned
and
rested
he
found
himself
as
nearly
exhausted
as
he
had
ever
been
wet
with
sweat
his
hands
torn
and
burning
his
breast
laboring
his
legs
stinging
from
innumerable
bruises
while
he
leaned
there
to
catch
his
breath
he
listened
for
the
pursuing
hounds
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
sound
from
them
this
however
did
not
deceive
him
into
any
hopefulness
there
were
bloodhounds
that
bayed
often
on
a
trail
and
others
that
ran
mostly
silent
the
former
were
more
valuable
to
their
owner
and
the
latter
more
dangerous
to
the
fugitive
presently
duane
ears
were
filled
by
a
chorus
of
short
ringing
yelps
the
pack
had
found
where
he
had
slept
and
now
the
trail
was
hot
satisfied
that
they
would
soon
overtake
him
duane
set
about
climbing
the
cottonwood
which
in
his
condition
was
difficult
of
ascent
it
happened
to
be
a
fairly
large
tree
with
a
fork
about
fifteen
feet
up
and
branches
thereafter
in
succession
duane
climbed
until
he
got
above
the
enshrouding
belt
of
blackness
a
pale
gray
mist
hung
above
the
brake
and
through
it
shone
a
line
of
dim
lights
duane
decided
these
were
bonfires
made
along
the
bluff
to
render
his
escape
more
difficult
on
that
side
away
round
in
the
direction
he
thought
was
north
he
imagined
he
saw
more
fires
but
as
the
mist
was
thick
he
could
not
be
sure
while
he
sat
there
pondering
the
matter
listening
for
the
hounds
the
mist
and
the
gloom
on
one
side
lightened
and
this
side
he
concluded
was
east
and
meant
that
dawn
was
near
satisfying
himself
on
this
score
he
descended
to
the
first
branch
of
the
tree
his
situation
now
though
still
critical
did
not
appear
to
be
so
hopeless
as
it
had
been
the
hounds
would
soon
close
in
on
him
and
he
would
kill
them
or
drive
them
away
it
was
beyond
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
any
men
could
have
followed
running
hounds
through
that
brake
in
the
night
the
thing
that
worried
duane
was
the
fact
of
the
bonfires
he
had
gathered
from
the
words
of
one
of
his
pursuers
that
the
brake
was
a
kind
of
trap
and
he
began
to
believe
there
was
only
one
way
out
of
it
and
that
was
along
the
bank
where
he
had
entered
and
where
obviously
all
night
long
his
pursuers
had
kept
fires
burning
further
conjecture
on
this
point
however
was
interrupted
by
a
crashing
in
the
willows
and
the
rapid
patter
of
feet
underneath
duane
lay
a
gray
foggy
obscurity
he
could
not
see
the
ground
nor
any
object
but
the
black
trunk
of
the
tree
sight
would
not
be
needed
to
tell
him
when
the
pack
arrived
with
a
pattering
rush
through
the
willows
the
hounds
reached
the
tree
and
then
high
above
crash
of
brush
and
thud
of
heavy
paws
rose
a
hideous
clamor
pursuers
far
off
to
the
south
would
hear
that
and
know
what
it
meant
and
at
daybreak
perhaps
before
they
would
take
a
short
cut
across
the
brake
guided
by
the
baying
of
hounds
that
had
treed
their
quarry
it
wanted
only
a
few
moments
however
till
duane
could
distinguish
the
vague
forms
of
the
hounds
in
the
gray
shadow
below
still
he
waited
he
had
no
shots
to
spare
and
he
knew
how
to
treat
bloodhounds
gradually
the
obscurity
lightened
and
at
length
duane
had
good
enough
sight
of
the
hounds
for
his
purpose
his
first
shot
killed
the
huge
brute
leader
of
the
pack
then
with
unerring
shots
he
crippled
several
others
that
stopped
the
baying
piercing
howls
arose
the
pack
took
fright
and
fled
its
course
easily
marked
by
the
howls
of
the
crippled
members
duane
reloaded
his
gun
and
making
certain
all
the
hounds
had
gone
he
descended
to
the
ground
and
set
off
at
a
rapid
pace
to
the
northward
the
mist
had
dissolved
under
a
rising
sun
when
duane
made
his
first
halt
some
miles
north
of
the
scene
where
he
had
waited
for
the
hounds
a
barrier
to
further
progress
in
shape
of
a
precipitous
rocky
bluff
rose
sheer
from
the
willow
brake
he
skirted
the
base
of
the
cliff
where
walking
was
comparatively
easy
around
in
the
direction
of
the
river
he
reached
the
end
finally
to
see
there
was
absolutely
no
chance
to
escape
from
the
brake
at
that
corner
it
took
extreme
labor
attended
by
some
hazard
and
considerable
pain
to
his
arm
to
get
down
where
he
could
fill
his
sombrero
with
water
after
quenching
his
thirst
he
had
a
look
at
his
wound
it
was
caked
over
with
blood
and
dirt
when
washed
off
the
arm
was
seen
to
be
inflamed
and
swollen
around
the
he
bathed
it
experiencing
a
soothing
relief
in
the
cool
water
then
he
bandaged
it
as
best
he
could
and
arranged
a
sling
round
his
neck
this
mitigated
the
pain
of
the
injured
member
and
held
it
in
a
quiet
and
restful
position
where
it
had
a
chance
to
begin
mending
as
duane
turned
away
from
the
river
he
felt
refreshed
his
great
strength
and
endurance
had
always
made
fatigue
something
almost
unknown
to
him
however
tramping
on
foot
day
and
night
was
as
unusual
to
him
as
to
any
other
riders
of
the
southwest
and
it
had
begun
to
tell
on
him
retracing
his
steps
he
reached
the
point
where
he
had
abruptly
come
upon
the
bluff
and
here
he
determined
to
follow
along
its
base
in
the
other
direction
until
he
found
a
way
out
or
discovered
the
futility
of
such
effort
duane
covered
ground
rapidly
from
time
to
time
he
paused
to
listen
but
he
was
always
listening
and
his
eyes
were
ever
roving
this
alertness
had
become
second
nature
with
him
so
that
except
in
extreme
cases
of
caution
he
performed
it
while
he
pondered
his
gloomy
and
fateful
situation
such
habit
of
alertness
and
thought
made
time
fly
swiftly
by
noon
he
had
rounded
the
wide
curve
of
the
brake
and
was
facing
south
the
bluff
had
petered
out
from
a
high
mountainous
wall
to
a
low
abutment
of
rock
but
it
still
held
to
its
steep
rough
nature
and
afforded
no
crack
or
slope
where
quick
ascent
could
have
been
possible
he
pushed
on
growing
warier
as
he
approached
the
finding
that
as
he
neared
the
river
on
this
side
it
was
imperative
to
go
deeper
into
the
willows
in
the
afternoon
he
reached
a
point
where
he
could
see
men
pacing
to
and
fro
on
the
bluff
this
assured
him
that
whatever
place
was
guarded
was
one
by
which
he
might
escape
he
headed
toward
these
men
and
approached
to
within
a
hundred
paces
of
the
bluff
where
they
were
there
were
several
men
and
several
boys
all
armed
and
after
the
manner
of
texans
taking
their
task
leisurely
farther
down
duane
made
out
black
dots
on
the
horizon
of
the
and
these
he
concluded
were
more
guards
stationed
at
another
outlet
probably
all
the
available
men
in
the
district
were
on
duty
texans
took
a
grim
pleasure
in
such
work
duane
remembered
that
upon
several
occasions
he
had
served
such
duty
himself
duane
peered
through
the
branches
and
studied
the
lay
of
the
land
for
several
hundred
yards
the
bluff
could
be
climbed
he
took
stock
of
those
careless
guards
they
had
rifles
and
that
made
vain
any
attempt
to
pass
them
in
daylight
he
believed
an
attempt
by
night
might
be
successful
and
he
was
swiftly
coming
to
a
determination
to
hide
there
till
dark
and
then
try
it
when
the
sudden
yelping
of
a
dog
betrayed
him
to
the
guards
on
the
bluff
the
dog
had
likely
been
placed
there
to
give
an
alarm
and
he
was
lustily
true
to
his
trust
duane
saw
the
men
run
together
and
begin
to
talk
excitedly
and
peer
into
the
brake
which
was
a
signal
for
him
to
slip
away
under
the
willows
he
made
no
noise
and
he
assured
himself
he
must
be
invisible
nevertheless
he
heard
shouts
then
the
cracking
of
rifles
and
bullets
began
to
zip
and
swish
through
the
leafy
covert
the
day
was
hot
and
windless
and
duane
concluded
that
whenever
he
touched
a
willow
stem
even
ever
so
slightly
it
vibrated
to
the
top
and
sent
a
quiver
among
the
leaves
through
this
the
guards
had
located
his
position
once
a
bullet
hissed
by
him
another
thudded
into
the
ground
before
him
this
shooting
loosed
a
rage
in
duane
he
had
to
fly
from
these
men
and
he
hated
them
and
himself
because
of
it
always
in
the
fury
of
such
moments
he
wanted
to
give
back
shot
for
shot
but
he
slipped
on
through
the
willows
and
at
length
the
rifles
ceased
to
crack
he
sheered
to
the
left
again
in
line
with
the
rocky
barrier
and
kept
on
wondering
what
the
next
mile
would
bring
it
brought
worse
for
he
was
seen
by
scouts
and
a
hot
fusillade
drove
him
to
run
for
his
life
luckily
to
escape
with
no
more
than
a
shoulder
later
that
day
still
undaunted
he
sheered
again
toward
the
and
found
that
the
nearer
he
approached
to
the
place
where
he
had
come
down
into
the
brake
the
greater
his
danger
to
attempt
to
run
the
blockade
of
that
trail
by
day
would
be
fatal
he
waited
for
night
and
after
the
brightness
of
the
fires
had
somewhat
lessened
he
assayed
to
creep
out
of
the
brake
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
foot
of
the
bluff
here
only
a
bank
and
had
begun
to
crawl
stealthily
up
under
cover
of
a
shadow
when
a
hound
again
betrayed
his
position
retreating
to
the
willows
was
as
perilous
a
task
as
had
ever
confronted
duane
and
when
he
had
accomplished
it
right
under
what
seemed
a
hundred
blazing
rifles
he
felt
that
he
had
indeed
been
favored
by
providence
this
time
men
followed
him
a
goodly
ways
into
the
brake
and
the
ripping
of
lead
through
the
willows
sounded
on
all
sides
of
him
when
the
noise
of
pursuit
ceased
duane
sat
down
in
the
darkness
his
mind
clamped
between
two
things
whether
to
try
again
to
escape
or
wait
for
possible
opportunity
he
seemed
incapable
of
decision
his
intelligence
told
him
that
every
hour
lessened
his
chances
for
escape
he
had
little
enough
chance
in
any
case
and
that
was
what
made
another
attempt
so
desperately
hard
still
it
was
not
love
of
life
that
bound
him
there
would
come
an
hour
sooner
or
later
when
he
would
wrench
decision
out
of
this
chaos
of
emotion
and
thought
but
that
time
was
not
yet
he
had
remained
quiet
long
enough
to
cool
off
and
recover
from
his
run
he
found
that
he
was
tired
he
stretched
out
to
rest
but
the
swarms
of
vicious
mosquitoes
prevented
sleep
this
corner
of
the
brake
was
low
and
near
the
river
a
for
the
they
sang
and
hummed
and
whined
around
him
in
an
horde
he
covered
his
head
and
hands
with
his
coat
and
lay
there
patiently
that
was
a
long
and
wretched
night
morning
found
him
still
strong
physically
but
in
a
dreadful
state
of
mind
first
he
hurried
for
the
river
he
could
withstand
the
pangs
of
hunger
but
it
was
imperative
to
quench
thirst
his
wound
made
him
feverish
and
therefore
more
than
usually
hot
and
thirsty
again
he
was
refreshed
that
morning
he
was
hard
put
to
it
to
hold
himself
back
from
attempting
to
cross
the
river
if
he
could
find
a
light
log
it
was
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
he
might
ford
the
shallow
water
and
bars
of
quicksand
but
not
yet
wearily
doggedly
he
faced
about
toward
the
bluff
all
that
day
and
all
that
night
all
the
next
day
and
all
the
next
night
he
stole
like
a
hunted
savage
from
river
to
bluff
and
every
hour
forced
upon
him
the
bitter
certainty
that
he
was
trapped
duane
lost
track
of
days
of
events
he
had
come
to
an
evil
pass
there
arrived
an
hour
when
closely
pressed
by
pursuers
at
the
extreme
southern
corner
of
the
brake
he
took
to
a
dense
thicket
of
willows
driven
to
what
he
believed
was
his
last
stand
if
only
these
human
bloodhounds
would
swiftly
close
in
on
him
let
him
fight
to
the
last
bitter
gasp
and
have
it
over
but
these
hunters
eager
as
they
were
to
get
him
had
care
of
their
own
skins
they
took
few
risks
they
had
him
cornered
it
was
the
middle
of
the
day
hot
dusty
oppressive
threatening
storm
like
a
snake
duane
crawled
into
a
little
space
in
the
darkest
part
of
the
thicket
and
lay
still
men
had
cut
him
off
from
the
bluff
from
the
river
seemingly
from
all
sides
but
he
heard
voices
only
from
in
front
and
toward
his
left
even
if
his
passage
to
the
river
had
not
been
blocked
it
might
just
as
well
have
been
on
fellers
down
hyar
called
one
man
from
the
bluff
him
corralled
at
last
shouted
another
ye
need
be
too
shore
we
thought
thet
more
once
taunted
another
seen
him
i
tell
thet
was
a
bill
found
fresh
tracks
an
blood
on
the
he
winged
we
need
on
thar
you
boys
came
a
shout
in
authoritative
tones
from
farther
up
the
bluff
slow
air
gittin
foolish
at
the
end
of
a
long
right
colonel
hold
back
there
nothin
shorer
than
somebody
be
stoppin
lead
pretty
quick
he
be
huntin
us
soon
surround
this
corner
an
starve
him
the
how
clearly
all
this
talk
pierced
duane
ears
in
it
he
seemed
to
hear
his
doom
this
then
was
the
end
he
had
always
expected
which
had
been
close
to
him
before
yet
never
like
now
god
whispered
duane
thing
for
me
to
do
now
is
go
out
meet
them
that
was
prompted
by
the
fighting
the
killing
instinct
in
him
in
that
moment
it
had
almost
superhuman
power
if
he
must
die
that
was
the
way
for
him
to
die
what
else
could
be
expected
of
buck
duane
he
got
to
his
knees
and
drew
his
gun
with
his
swollen
and
almost
useless
hand
he
held
what
spare
ammunition
he
had
left
he
ought
to
creep
out
noiselessly
to
the
edge
of
the
willows
suddenly
face
his
pursuers
then
while
there
was
a
beat
left
in
his
heart
kill
kill
kill
these
men
all
had
rifles
the
fight
would
be
short
but
the
marksmen
did
not
live
on
earth
who
could
make
such
a
fight
go
wholly
against
him
confronting
them
suddenly
he
could
kill
a
man
for
every
shot
in
his
gun
thus
duane
reasoned
so
he
hoped
to
accept
his
fate
to
meet
this
end
but
when
he
tried
to
step
forward
something
checked
him
he
forced
himself
yet
he
could
not
go
the
obstruction
that
opposed
his
will
was
as
insurmountable
as
it
had
been
physically
impossible
for
him
to
climb
the
bluff
slowly
he
fell
back
crouched
low
and
then
lay
flat
the
grim
and
ghastly
dignity
that
had
been
his
a
moment
before
fell
away
from
him
he
lay
there
stripped
of
his
last
shred
of
he
wondered
was
he
afraid
had
he
the
last
of
the
duanes
had
he
come
to
feel
fear
no
never
in
all
his
wild
life
had
he
so
longed
to
go
out
and
meet
men
face
to
face
it
was
not
fear
that
held
him
back
he
hated
this
hiding
this
eternal
vigilance
this
hopeless
life
the
damnable
paradox
of
the
situation
was
that
if
he
went
out
to
meet
these
men
there
was
absolutely
no
doubt
of
his
doom
if
he
clung
to
his
covert
there
was
a
chance
a
merest
chance
for
his
life
these
pursuers
dogged
and
unflagging
as
they
had
been
were
mortally
afraid
of
him
it
was
his
fame
that
made
them
cowards
duane
keenness
told
him
that
at
the
very
darkest
and
most
perilous
moment
there
was
still
a
chance
for
him
and
the
blood
in
him
the
temper
of
his
father
the
years
of
his
outlawry
the
pride
of
his
unsought
and
hated
career
the
nameless
inexplicable
something
in
him
made
him
accept
that
slim
chance
waiting
then
became
a
physical
and
mental
agony
he
lay
under
the
burning
sun
parched
by
thirst
laboring
to
breathe
sweating
and
bleeding
his
wound
was
like
a
prong
in
his
flesh
blotched
and
swollen
from
the
attack
of
flies
and
mosquitoes
his
face
seemed
twice
its
natural
size
and
it
ached
and
stung
on
one
side
then
was
this
physical
torture
on
the
other
the
old
hell
terribly
augmented
at
this
crisis
in
his
mind
it
seemed
that
thought
and
imagination
had
never
been
so
swift
if
death
found
him
presently
how
would
it
come
would
he
get
decent
burial
or
be
left
for
the
peccaries
and
the
coyotes
would
his
people
ever
know
where
he
had
fallen
how
wretched
how
miserable
his
state
it
was
cowardly
it
was
monstrous
for
him
to
cling
longer
to
this
doomed
life
then
the
hate
in
his
heart
the
hellish
hate
of
these
men
on
his
trail
that
was
like
a
scourge
he
felt
no
longer
human
he
had
degenerated
into
an
animal
that
could
think
his
heart
pounded
his
pulse
beat
his
breast
heaved
and
this
internal
strife
seemed
to
thunder
into
his
ears
he
was
now
enacting
the
tragedy
of
all
crippled
starved
hunted
wolves
at
bay
in
their
dens
only
his
tragedy
was
infinitely
more
terrible
because
he
had
mind
enough
to
see
his
plight
his
resemblance
to
a
lonely
wolf
dripping
snarling
in
a
last
instinctive
defiance
mounted
upon
the
horror
of
duane
thought
was
a
watching
listening
intensity
so
supreme
that
it
registered
impressions
which
were
creations
of
his
imagination
he
heard
stealthy
steps
that
were
not
there
he
saw
shadowy
moving
figures
that
were
only
leaves
a
hundred
times
when
he
was
about
to
pull
trigger
he
discovered
his
error
yet
voices
came
from
a
distance
and
steps
and
crackings
in
the
willows
and
other
sounds
real
enough
but
duane
could
not
distinguish
the
real
from
the
false
there
were
times
when
the
wind
which
had
arisen
sent
a
hot
pattering
breath
down
the
willow
aisles
and
duane
heard
it
as
an
approaching
army
this
straining
of
duane
faculties
brought
on
a
reaction
which
in
itself
was
a
respite
he
saw
the
sun
darkened
by
thick
slow
spreading
clouds
a
storm
appeared
to
be
coming
how
slowly
it
moved
the
air
was
like
steam
if
there
broke
one
of
those
dark
violent
storms
common
though
rare
to
the
country
duane
believed
he
might
slip
away
in
the
fury
of
wind
and
rain
hope
that
seemed
unquenchable
in
him
resurged
again
he
hailed
it
with
a
bitterness
that
was
sickening
then
at
a
rustling
step
he
froze
into
the
old
strained
attention
he
heard
a
slow
patter
of
soft
feet
a
tawny
shape
crossed
a
little
opening
in
the
thicket
it
was
that
of
a
dog
the
moment
while
that
beast
came
into
full
view
was
an
age
the
dog
was
not
a
bloodhound
and
if
he
had
a
trail
or
a
scent
he
seemed
to
be
at
fault
on
it
duane
waited
for
the
inevitable
discovery
any
kind
of
a
could
have
found
him
in
that
thicket
voices
from
outside
could
be
heard
urging
on
the
dog
rover
they
called
him
duane
sat
up
at
the
moment
the
dog
entered
the
little
shaded
covert
duane
expected
a
yelping
a
baying
or
at
least
a
bark
that
would
tell
of
his
a
strange
relief
swiftly
swayed
over
duane
the
end
was
near
now
he
had
no
further
choice
let
them
come
a
quick
fierce
exchange
of
shots
and
then
this
torture
past
he
waited
for
the
dog
to
give
the
alarm
but
the
dog
looked
at
him
and
trotted
by
into
the
thicket
without
a
yelp
duane
could
not
believe
the
evidence
of
his
senses
he
thought
he
had
suddenly
gone
deaf
he
saw
the
dog
disappear
heard
him
running
to
and
fro
among
the
willows
getting
farther
and
farther
away
till
all
sound
from
him
ceased
rover
called
a
voice
from
the
been
through
thet
black
a
rabbit
in
there
replied
another
thet
pup
no
good
scornfully
growled
another
man
a
hound
at
thet
clump
of
the
game
burn
the
brake
before
the
rain
the
voices
droned
off
as
their
owners
evidently
walked
up
the
ridge
then
upon
duane
fell
the
crushing
burden
of
the
old
waiting
watching
listening
spell
after
all
it
was
not
to
end
just
now
his
chance
still
persisted
looked
a
little
brighter
led
him
on
perhaps
to
forlorn
hope
all
at
once
twilight
settled
quickly
down
upon
the
willow
brake
or
else
duane
noted
it
suddenly
he
imagined
it
to
be
caused
by
the
approaching
storm
but
there
was
little
movement
of
air
or
cloud
and
thunder
still
muttered
and
rumbled
at
a
distance
the
fact
was
the
sun
had
set
and
at
this
time
of
overcast
sky
night
was
at
hand
duane
realized
it
with
the
awakening
of
all
his
old
force
he
would
yet
elude
his
pursuers
that
was
the
moment
when
he
seized
the
significance
of
all
these
fortunate
circumstances
which
had
aided
him
without
haste
and
without
sound
he
began
to
crawl
in
the
direction
of
the
river
it
was
not
far
and
he
reached
the
bank
before
darkness
set
in
there
were
men
up
on
the
bluff
carrying
wood
to
build
a
bonfire
for
a
moment
he
half
yielded
to
a
temptation
to
try
to
slip
along
the
close
in
under
the
willows
but
when
he
raised
himself
to
peer
out
he
saw
that
an
attempt
of
this
kind
would
be
liable
to
failure
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
a
plank
lying
beneath
him
lodged
against
some
willows
the
end
of
the
plank
extended
in
almost
to
a
point
beneath
him
quick
as
a
flash
he
saw
where
a
desperate
chance
invited
him
then
he
tied
his
gun
in
an
oilskin
bag
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
the
bank
was
steep
and
crumbly
he
must
not
break
off
any
earth
to
splash
into
the
water
there
was
a
willow
growing
back
some
few
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
bank
cautiously
he
pulled
it
down
bent
it
over
the
water
so
that
when
he
released
it
there
would
be
no
springing
back
then
he
trusted
his
weight
to
it
with
his
feet
sliding
carefully
down
the
bank
he
went
into
the
water
almost
up
to
his
knees
felt
the
quicksand
grip
his
feet
then
leaning
forward
till
he
reached
the
plank
he
pulled
it
toward
him
and
lay
upon
it
without
a
sound
one
end
went
slowly
under
water
and
the
farther
end
appeared
lightly
braced
against
the
overhanging
willows
very
carefully
then
duane
began
to
extricate
his
right
foot
from
the
sucking
sand
it
seemed
as
if
his
foot
was
incased
in
solid
rock
but
there
was
a
movement
upward
and
he
pulled
with
all
the
power
he
dared
use
it
came
slowly
and
at
length
was
free
the
left
one
he
released
with
less
difficulty
the
next
few
moments
he
put
all
his
attention
on
the
plank
to
ascertain
if
his
weight
would
sink
it
into
the
sand
the
far
end
slipped
off
the
willows
with
a
little
splash
and
gradually
settled
to
rest
upon
the
bottom
but
it
sank
no
farther
and
duane
greatest
concern
was
relieved
however
as
it
was
manifestly
impossible
for
him
to
keep
his
head
up
for
long
he
carefully
crawled
out
upon
the
plank
until
he
could
rest
an
arm
and
shoulder
upon
the
willows
when
he
looked
up
it
was
to
find
the
night
strangely
luminous
with
fires
there
was
a
bonfire
on
the
extreme
end
of
the
bluff
another
a
hundred
paces
beyond
a
great
flare
extended
over
the
brake
in
that
direction
duane
heard
a
roaring
on
the
wind
and
he
knew
his
pursuers
had
fired
the
willows
he
did
not
believe
that
would
help
them
much
the
brake
was
dry
enough
but
too
green
to
burn
readily
and
as
for
the
bonfires
he
discovered
that
the
men
probably
having
run
out
of
wood
were
keeping
up
the
light
with
oil
and
stuff
from
the
village
a
dozen
men
kept
watch
on
the
bluff
scarcely
fifty
paces
from
where
duane
lay
concealed
by
the
willows
they
talked
cracked
jokes
sang
songs
and
manifestly
considered
this
a
great
lark
as
long
as
the
bright
light
lasted
duane
dared
not
move
he
had
the
patience
and
the
endurance
to
wait
for
the
breaking
of
the
storm
and
if
that
did
not
come
then
the
early
hour
before
dawn
when
the
gray
fog
and
gloom
were
over
the
river
escape
was
now
in
his
grasp
he
felt
it
and
with
that
in
his
mind
he
waited
strong
as
steel
in
his
conviction
capable
of
withstanding
any
strain
endurable
by
the
human
frame
the
wind
blew
in
puffs
grew
wilder
and
roared
through
the
willows
carrying
bright
sparks
upward
thunder
rolled
down
over
the
river
and
lightning
began
to
flash
then
the
rain
fell
in
heavy
sheets
but
not
steadily
the
flashes
of
lightning
and
the
broad
flares
played
so
incessantly
that
duane
could
not
trust
himself
out
on
the
open
river
certainly
the
storm
rather
increased
the
watchfulness
of
the
men
on
the
bluff
he
knew
how
to
wait
and
he
waited
grimly
standing
pain
and
cramp
and
chill
the
storm
wore
away
as
desultorily
as
it
had
come
and
the
long
night
set
in
there
were
times
when
duane
thought
he
was
paralyzed
others
when
he
grew
sick
giddy
weak
from
the
strained
posture
the
first
paling
of
the
stars
quickened
him
with
a
kind
of
wild
joy
he
watched
them
grow
paler
dimmer
disappear
one
by
one
a
shadow
hovered
down
rested
upon
the
river
and
gradually
thickened
the
bonfire
on
the
bluff
showed
as
through
a
foggy
veil
the
watchers
were
mere
groping
dark
figures
duane
aware
of
how
cramped
he
had
become
from
long
inaction
began
to
move
his
legs
and
uninjured
arm
and
body
and
at
length
overcame
a
paralyzing
stiffness
then
digging
his
hand
in
the
sand
and
holding
the
plank
with
his
knees
he
edged
it
out
into
the
river
inch
by
inch
he
advanced
until
clear
of
the
willows
looking
upward
he
saw
the
shadowy
figures
of
the
men
on
the
bluff
he
realized
they
ought
to
see
him
feared
that
they
would
but
he
kept
on
cautiously
noiselessly
with
a
slowness
from
time
to
time
his
elbow
made
a
little
gurgle
and
splash
in
the
water
try
as
he
might
he
could
not
prevent
this
it
got
to
be
like
the
hollow
roar
of
a
rapid
filling
his
ears
with
mocking
sound
there
was
a
perceptible
current
out
in
the
river
and
it
hindered
straight
advancement
inch
by
inch
he
crept
on
expecting
to
hear
the
bang
of
rifles
the
spattering
of
bullets
he
tried
not
to
look
backward
but
failed
the
fire
appeared
a
little
dimmer
the
moving
shadows
a
little
darker
once
the
plank
stuck
in
the
sand
and
felt
as
if
it
were
settling
bringing
feet
to
aid
his
hand
he
shoved
it
over
the
treacherous
place
this
way
he
made
faster
progress
the
obscurity
of
the
river
seemed
to
be
enveloping
him
when
he
looked
back
again
the
figures
of
the
men
were
coalescing
with
the
surrounding
gloom
the
fires
were
streaky
blurred
patches
of
light
but
the
sky
above
was
brighter
dawn
was
not
far
off
to
the
west
all
was
dark
with
infinite
care
and
implacable
spirit
and
waning
strength
duane
shoved
the
plank
along
and
when
at
last
he
discerned
the
black
border
of
bank
it
came
in
time
he
thought
to
save
him
he
crawled
out
rested
till
the
gray
dawn
broke
and
then
headed
north
through
the
willows
chapter
xiii
how
long
duane
was
traveling
out
of
that
region
he
never
knew
but
he
reached
familiar
country
and
found
a
rancher
who
had
before
befriended
him
here
his
arm
was
attended
to
he
had
food
and
sleep
and
in
a
couple
of
weeks
he
was
himself
again
when
the
time
came
for
duane
to
ride
away
on
his
endless
trail
his
friend
reluctantly
imparted
the
information
that
some
thirty
miles
south
near
the
village
of
shirley
there
was
posted
at
a
certain
a
reward
for
buck
duane
dead
or
alive
duane
had
heard
of
such
notices
but
he
had
never
seen
one
his
friend
reluctance
and
refusal
to
state
for
what
particular
deed
this
reward
was
offered
roused
duane
curiosity
he
had
never
been
any
closer
to
shirley
than
this
rancher
home
doubtless
some
burglary
some
scrape
had
been
attributed
to
him
and
he
had
been
accused
of
worse
deeds
abruptly
duane
decided
to
ride
over
there
and
find
out
who
wanted
him
dead
or
alive
and
why
as
he
started
south
on
the
road
he
reflected
that
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
deliberately
hunted
trouble
introspection
awarded
him
this
knowledge
during
that
last
terrible
flight
on
the
lower
nueces
and
while
he
lay
abed
recuperating
he
had
changed
a
fixed
immutable
hopeless
bitterness
abided
with
him
he
had
reached
the
end
of
his
rope
all
the
power
of
his
mind
and
soul
were
unavailable
to
turn
him
back
from
his
fate
that
fate
was
to
become
an
outlaw
in
every
sense
of
the
term
to
be
what
he
was
credited
with
being
that
is
to
say
to
embrace
evil
he
had
never
committed
a
crime
he
wondered
now
was
crime
close
to
him
he
reasoned
finally
that
the
desperation
of
crime
had
been
forced
upon
him
if
not
its
motive
and
that
if
driven
there
was
no
limit
to
his
possibilities
he
understood
now
many
of
the
hitherto
inexplicable
actions
of
certain
noted
outlaws
why
they
had
returned
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
that
had
outlawed
them
why
they
took
such
strangely
fatal
chances
why
life
was
no
more
to
them
than
a
breath
of
wind
why
they
rode
straight
into
the
jaws
of
death
to
confront
wronged
men
or
hunting
rangers
vigilantes
to
laugh
in
their
very
faces
it
was
such
bitterness
as
this
that
drove
these
men
toward
afternoon
from
the
top
of
a
long
hill
duane
saw
the
green
fields
and
trees
and
shining
roofs
of
a
town
he
considered
must
be
shirley
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
he
came
upon
an
intersecting
road
there
was
a
placard
nailed
on
the
crossroad
duane
drew
rein
near
it
and
leaned
close
to
read
the
faded
print
reward
for
buck
duane
dead
or
alive
peering
closer
to
read
the
finer
more
faded
print
duane
learned
that
he
was
wanted
for
the
murder
of
jeff
aiken
at
her
ranch
near
shirley
the
month
september
was
named
but
the
date
was
illegible
the
reward
was
offered
by
the
woman
husband
whose
name
appeared
with
that
of
a
sheriff
at
the
bottom
of
the
placard
duane
read
the
thing
twice
when
he
straightened
he
was
sick
with
the
horror
of
his
fate
wild
with
passion
at
those
misguided
fools
who
could
believe
that
he
had
harmed
a
woman
then
he
remembered
kate
bland
and
as
always
when
she
returned
to
him
he
quaked
inwardly
years
before
word
had
gone
abroad
that
he
had
killed
her
and
so
it
was
easy
for
men
wanting
to
fix
a
crime
to
name
him
perhaps
it
had
been
done
often
probably
he
bore
on
his
shoulders
a
burden
of
numberless
crimes
a
dark
passionate
fury
possessed
him
it
shook
him
like
a
storm
shakes
the
oak
when
it
passed
leaving
him
cold
with
clouded
brow
and
piercing
eye
his
mind
was
set
spurring
his
horse
he
rode
straight
toward
the
village
shirley
appeared
to
be
a
large
pretentious
country
town
a
branch
of
some
railroad
terminated
there
the
main
street
was
wide
bordered
by
trees
and
commodious
houses
and
many
of
the
stores
were
of
brick
a
large
plaza
shaded
by
giant
cottonwood
trees
occupied
a
central
location
duane
pulled
his
running
horse
and
halted
him
plunging
and
snorting
before
a
group
of
idle
men
who
lounged
on
benches
in
the
shade
of
a
spreading
cottonwood
how
many
times
had
duane
seen
just
that
kind
of
lazy
texas
group
not
often
however
had
he
seen
such
placid
lolling
men
change
their
expression
their
attitude
so
swiftly
his
advent
apparently
was
momentous
they
evidently
took
him
for
an
unusual
visitor
so
far
as
duane
could
tell
not
one
of
them
recognized
him
had
a
hint
of
his
identity
he
slid
off
his
horse
and
threw
the
bridle
buck
duane
he
said
saw
that
placard
out
there
on
a
it
a
damn
lie
somebody
find
this
man
jeff
aiken
i
want
to
see
his
announcement
was
taken
in
absolute
silence
that
was
the
only
effect
he
noted
for
he
avoided
looking
at
these
villagers
the
reason
was
simple
enough
duane
felt
himself
overcome
with
emotion
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
put
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
hands
to
his
face
for
once
he
had
absolutely
no
concern
for
his
fate
this
ignominy
was
the
last
straw
presently
however
he
became
aware
of
some
kind
of
commotion
among
these
villagers
he
heard
whisperings
low
hoarse
voices
then
the
shuffle
of
rapid
feet
moving
away
all
at
once
a
violent
hand
jerked
his
gun
from
its
holster
when
duane
rose
a
gaunt
man
livid
of
face
shaking
like
a
leaf
confronted
him
with
his
own
gun
up
thar
you
buck
duane
he
roared
waving
the
gun
that
appeared
to
be
the
cue
for
pandemonium
to
break
loose
duane
opened
his
lips
to
speak
but
if
he
had
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
he
could
not
have
made
himself
heard
in
weary
disgust
he
looked
at
the
gaunt
man
and
then
at
the
others
who
were
working
themselves
into
a
frenzy
he
made
no
move
however
to
hold
up
his
hands
the
villagers
surrounded
him
emboldened
by
finding
him
now
unarmed
then
several
men
lay
hold
of
his
arms
and
pinioned
them
behind
his
back
resistance
was
useless
even
if
duane
had
had
the
spirit
some
one
of
them
fetched
his
halter
from
his
saddle
and
with
this
they
bound
him
helpless
people
were
running
now
from
the
street
the
stores
the
houses
old
men
cowboys
clerks
boys
ranchers
came
on
the
trot
the
crowd
grew
the
increasing
clamor
began
to
attract
women
as
well
as
men
a
group
of
girls
ran
up
then
hung
back
in
fright
and
pity
the
presence
of
cowboys
made
a
difference
they
split
up
the
crowd
got
to
duane
and
lay
hold
of
him
with
rough
businesslike
hands
one
of
them
lifted
his
fists
and
roared
at
the
frenzied
mob
to
fall
back
to
stop
the
racket
he
beat
them
back
into
a
circle
but
it
was
some
little
time
before
the
hubbub
quieted
down
so
a
voice
could
be
heard
up
will
he
was
yelling
us
a
chance
to
hear
somethin
easy
now
soho
there
ai
nobody
goin
to
be
hurt
right
everybody
quiet
now
let
see
what
come
this
cowboy
evidently
one
of
authority
or
at
least
one
of
strong
personality
turned
to
the
gaunt
man
who
still
waved
duane
gun
put
the
gun
down
he
said
might
go
off
here
give
it
to
me
now
what
wrong
who
this
roped
gent
an
what
he
done
the
gaunt
fellow
who
appeared
now
about
to
collapse
lifted
a
shaking
hand
and
pointed
thar
feller
he
buck
duane
he
panted
an
angry
murmur
ran
through
the
surrounding
crowd
rope
the
rope
throw
it
over
a
branch
string
him
up
cried
an
excited
villager
duane
buck
duane
him
the
cowboy
silenced
these
cries
how
do
you
know
this
fellow
is
buck
duane
he
asked
sharply
he
said
so
replied
the
man
called
abe
came
the
exclamation
incredulously
a
tarnal
fact
panted
abe
waving
his
hands
importantly
he
was
an
old
man
and
appeared
to
be
carried
away
with
the
significance
of
his
deed
like
to
rid
his
hoss
right
over
then
he
jumped
off
says
he
was
buck
duane
an
he
wanted
to
see
jeff
aiken
this
speech
caused
a
second
commotion
as
noisy
though
not
so
enduring
as
the
first
when
the
cowboy
assisted
by
a
couple
of
his
mates
had
restored
order
again
some
one
had
slipped
the
of
duane
rope
over
his
head
with
him
screeched
a
youth
the
mob
surged
closer
was
shoved
back
by
the
cowboys
if
you
ai
drunk
or
crazy
tell
thet
over
ordered
interlocutor
with
some
show
of
resentment
and
more
of
dignity
abe
reiterated
his
former
statement
he
buck
duane
hell
did
you
get
hold
of
his
gun
bluntly
queried
the
cowboy
he
set
down
thar
an
he
kind
of
hid
his
face
on
his
hand
an
i
grabbed
his
gun
an
got
the
drop
on
what
the
cowboy
thought
of
this
was
expressed
in
a
laugh
his
mates
likewise
grinned
broadly
then
the
leader
turned
to
duane
i
reckon
you
better
speak
up
for
yourself
he
said
that
stilled
the
crowd
as
no
command
had
done
buck
duane
all
said
duane
quietly
was
this
way
the
big
cowboy
seemed
to
vibrate
with
a
shock
all
the
ruddy
warmth
left
his
face
his
jaw
began
to
bulge
the
corded
veins
in
his
neck
stood
out
in
knots
in
an
instant
he
had
a
hard
stern
strange
look
he
shot
out
a
powerful
hand
that
fastened
in
the
front
of
duane
blouse
queer
here
but
if
you
duane
you
sure
in
bad
any
fool
ought
to
know
that
you
mean
it
then
in
to
shoot
up
the
town
eh
same
old
stunt
of
you
gunfighters
meant
to
kill
the
man
who
offered
a
reward
wanted
to
see
jeff
aiken
bad
huh
replied
duane
citizen
here
misrepresented
things
he
seems
a
little
off
his
he
is
somebody
is
that
sure
you
claim
buck
duane
then
all
his
doings
duane
yes
but
i
wo
stand
for
the
blame
of
things
i
never
did
that
why
i
here
i
saw
that
placard
out
there
offering
the
reward
until
now
i
never
was
within
half
a
day
ride
of
this
town
i
blamed
for
what
i
never
did
i
rode
in
here
told
who
i
was
asked
somebody
to
send
for
jeff
then
you
set
down
an
let
this
old
guy
throw
your
own
gun
on
you
queried
the
cowboy
in
amazement
guess
that
it
replied
duane
it
powerful
strange
if
you
really
buck
a
man
elbowed
his
way
into
the
circle
duane
i
recognize
him
i
seen
him
in
more
one
place
he
said
you
can
rely
on
what
i
tell
you
i
do
know
if
he
locoed
or
what
but
i
do
know
he
the
genuine
buck
duane
any
one
who
ever
seen
him
onct
would
never
forget
do
you
want
to
see
aiken
for
asked
the
cowboy
sibert
want
to
face
him
and
tell
him
i
never
harmed
his
i
innocent
that
we
send
for
aiken
an
he
hears
you
an
does
believe
you
what
then
he
wo
believe
me
why
then
my
case
so
bad
i
be
better
off
a
momentary
silence
was
broken
by
sibert
this
is
a
queer
deal
boys
reckon
we
better
send
for
went
fer
him
he
be
comin
soon
replied
a
man
duane
stood
a
head
taller
than
that
circle
of
curious
faces
he
gazed
out
above
and
beyond
them
it
was
in
this
way
that
he
chanced
to
see
a
number
of
women
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
some
were
old
with
hard
faces
like
the
men
some
were
young
and
comely
and
most
of
these
seemed
agitated
by
excitement
or
distress
they
cast
fearful
pitying
glances
upon
duane
as
he
stood
there
with
that
noose
round
his
neck
women
were
more
human
than
men
duane
thought
he
met
eyes
that
dilated
seemed
fascinated
at
his
gaze
but
were
not
averted
it
was
the
old
women
who
were
voluble
loud
in
expression
of
their
feelings
near
the
trunk
of
the
cottonwood
stood
a
slender
woman
in
white
wandering
glance
rested
upon
her
her
eyes
were
riveted
upon
him
a
woman
probably
who
did
not
want
to
see
him
hanged
comes
jeff
aiken
now
called
a
man
loudly
the
crowd
shifted
and
trampled
in
eagerness
duane
saw
two
men
coming
fast
one
of
whom
in
the
lead
was
of
stalwart
build
he
had
a
gun
in
his
hand
and
his
manner
was
that
of
fierce
energy
the
cowboy
sibert
thrust
open
the
jostling
circle
of
men
on
jeff
he
called
and
he
blocked
the
man
with
the
gun
he
spoke
so
low
duane
could
not
hear
what
he
said
and
his
form
hid
face
at
that
juncture
the
crowd
spread
out
closed
in
and
aiken
and
sibert
were
caught
in
the
circle
there
was
a
pushing
forward
a
pressing
of
many
bodies
hoarse
cries
and
flinging
hands
again
the
insane
tumult
was
about
to
break
out
the
demand
for
an
outlaw
blood
the
call
for
a
wild
justice
executed
a
thousand
times
before
on
bloody
soil
sibert
bellowed
at
the
dark
encroaching
mass
the
cowboys
with
him
beat
and
cuffed
in
vain
will
you
listen
broke
in
sibert
hurriedly
his
hand
on
the
other
man
arm
aiken
nodded
coolly
duane
who
had
seen
many
men
in
perfect
control
of
themselves
under
circumstances
like
these
recognized
the
spirit
that
dominated
aiken
he
was
white
cold
passionless
there
were
lines
of
bitter
grief
deep
round
his
lips
if
duane
ever
felt
the
meaning
of
death
he
felt
it
then
this
your
game
aiken
said
sibert
hear
me
a
minute
reckon
there
no
doubt
about
this
man
bein
buck
duane
he
seen
the
placard
out
at
the
he
rides
in
to
shirley
he
says
buck
duane
an
he
lookin
for
jeff
aiken
that
all
clear
enough
you
know
how
these
gunfighters
go
lookin
for
trouble
but
what
stumps
me
duane
sits
down
there
on
the
bench
and
lets
old
abe
strickland
grab
his
gun
ant
get
the
drop
on
him
more
that
he
gives
me
some
strange
talk
about
how
if
he
could
make
you
believe
innocent
he
better
be
dead
you
see
for
yourself
duane
ai
drunk
or
crazy
or
locoed
he
does
strike
me
as
a
man
who
rode
in
here
blood
so
i
reckon
you
better
hold
on
till
you
hear
what
he
has
to
then
for
the
first
time
the
giant
turned
his
gaze
upon
duane
he
had
intelligence
which
was
not
yet
subservient
to
passion
moreover
he
seemed
the
kind
of
man
duane
would
care
to
have
judge
him
in
a
critical
moment
like
this
said
duane
gravely
with
his
eyes
steady
on
aiken
buck
duane
i
never
lied
to
any
man
in
my
life
i
was
forced
into
outlawry
i
never
had
a
chance
to
leave
the
country
i
killed
men
to
save
my
own
life
i
never
intentionally
harmed
any
woman
i
rode
thirty
miles
deliberately
to
see
what
this
reward
was
who
made
it
what
for
when
i
read
the
placard
i
went
sick
to
the
bottom
of
my
soul
so
i
rode
in
here
to
find
you
to
tell
you
this
i
never
saw
shirley
before
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
have
killed
your
wife
last
september
i
was
two
hundred
miles
north
of
here
on
the
upper
nueces
i
can
prove
that
men
who
know
me
will
tell
you
i
murder
a
woman
i
have
any
idea
why
such
a
deed
should
be
laid
at
my
hands
it
just
that
wild
border
gossip
i
have
no
idea
what
reasons
you
have
for
holding
me
responsible
i
only
know
you
wrong

deceived
and
see
here
aiken
you
understand
i
a
miserable
man
i
about
broken
i
guess

more
for
life

anything
if
you
ca
look
me
in
the
eyes
man
to
man
and
believe
what
i
say
why
by
god
you
can
kill
me
aiken
heaved
a
great
breath
duane
whether
i
impressed
or
not
by
what
you
say
matter
you
had
accusers
justly
or
unjustly
as
will
soon
appear
the
thing
is
we
can
prove
you
innocent
or
guilty
my
girl
lucy
saw
my
wife
he
motioned
for
the
crowd
of
men
to
open
up
you
sibert
go
for
lucy
that
settle
this
duane
heard
as
a
man
in
an
ugly
dream
the
faces
around
him
the
hum
of
voices
all
seemed
far
off
his
life
hung
by
the
merest
thread
yet
he
did
not
think
of
that
so
much
as
of
the
brand
of
a
which
might
be
soon
sealed
upon
him
by
a
frightened
imaginative
child
the
crowd
trooped
apart
and
closed
again
duane
caught
a
blurred
image
of
a
slight
girl
clinging
to
sibert
hand
he
could
not
see
distinctly
aiken
lifted
the
child
whispered
soothingly
to
her
not
to
be
afraid
then
he
fetched
her
closer
to
duane
tell
me
did
you
ever
see
this
man
before
asked
aiken
huskily
and
low
he
the
one
who
came
in
the
house
that
day
struck
you
down
and
dragged
mama
aiken
voice
failed
a
lightning
flash
seemed
to
clear
duane
blurred
sight
he
saw
a
pale
sad
face
and
violet
eyes
fixed
in
gloom
and
horror
upon
his
no
terrible
moment
in
duane
life
ever
equaled
this
one
of
silence
of
suspense
ai
him
cried
the
child
then
sibert
was
flinging
the
noose
off
duane
neck
and
unwinding
the
bonds
round
his
arms
the
spellbound
crowd
awoke
to
hoarse
exclamations
there
my
locoed
gents
how
easy
you
hang
the
wrong
man
burst
out
the
cowboy
as
he
made
the
hiss
are
a
lot
of
wise
rangers
haw
haw
he
freed
duane
and
thrust
the
gun
back
in
duane
holster
abe
there
reckon
you
pulled
a
stunt
but
do
try
the
like
again
and
men
i
gamble
there
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
bad
work
buck
duane
named
for
which
all
he
never
done
clear
away
there
his
hoss
duane
the
road
open
out
of
sibert
swept
the
gaping
watchers
aside
and
pressed
duane
toward
the
horse
which
another
cowboy
held
mechanically
duane
mounted
felt
a
lift
as
he
went
up
then
the
cowboy
hard
face
softened
in
a
smile
reckon
it
ai
uncivil
of
me
to
say
hit
that
road
quick
he
said
frankly
he
led
the
horse
out
of
the
crowd
aiken
joined
him
and
between
them
they
escorted
duane
across
the
plaza
the
crowd
appeared
irresistibly
drawn
to
follow
aiken
paused
with
his
big
hand
on
duane
knee
in
it
unconsciously
probably
he
still
held
the
gun
a
word
with
you
he
said
believe
you
not
so
black
as
you
been
painted
i
wish
there
was
time
to
say
more
tell
me
this
anyway
do
you
know
the
ranger
captain
macnelly
do
not
replied
duane
in
surprise
met
him
only
a
week
ago
over
in
fairfield
went
on
aiken
hurriedly
declared
you
never
killed
my
wife
i
did
believe
him
argued
with
him
we
almost
had
hard
words
over
it
now
i
sorry
the
last
thing
he
said
was
you
ever
see
duane
do
kill
him
send
him
into
my
camp
after
dark
he
meant
something
strange
what
i
ca
say
but
he
was
right
and
i
was
wrong
if
lucy
had
batted
an
eye
i
have
killed
you
still
i
would
advise
you
to
hunt
up
macnelly
camp
he
clever
maybe
he
believes
there
no
treachery
in
his
new
ideas
of
ranger
tactics
i
tell
you
for
all
it
worth
may
god
help
you
further
as
he
did
this
day
duane
said
and
touched
the
horse
with
his
spurs
long
buck
called
sibert
with
that
frank
smile
breaking
warm
over
his
brown
face
and
he
held
his
sombrero
high
chapter
xiv
when
duane
reached
the
crossing
of
the
roads
the
name
fairfield
on
the
seemed
to
be
the
thing
that
tipped
the
oscillating
balance
of
decision
in
favor
of
that
direction
he
answered
here
to
unfathomable
impulse
if
he
had
been
driven
to
hunt
up
jeff
aiken
now
he
was
called
to
find
this
unknown
ranger
captain
in
duane
state
of
mind
clear
reasoning
common
sense
or
keenness
were
out
of
the
question
he
went
because
he
felt
he
was
compelled
dusk
had
fallen
when
he
rode
into
a
town
which
inquiry
discovered
to
be
fairfield
captain
macnelly
camp
was
stationed
just
out
of
the
village
limits
on
the
other
side
no
one
except
the
boy
duane
questioned
appeared
to
notice
his
arrival
like
shirley
the
town
of
fairfield
was
large
and
prosperous
compared
to
the
innumerable
hamlets
dotting
the
vast
extent
of
southwestern
texas
as
duane
rode
through
being
careful
to
get
off
the
main
street
he
heard
the
tolling
of
a
that
was
a
melancholy
reminder
of
his
old
home
there
did
not
appear
to
be
any
camp
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
but
as
duane
sat
his
horse
peering
around
and
undecided
what
further
move
to
make
he
caught
the
glint
of
flickering
lights
through
the
darkness
heading
toward
them
he
rode
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
come
upon
a
grove
of
mesquite
the
brightness
of
several
fires
made
the
surrounding
darkness
all
the
blacker
duane
saw
the
moving
forms
of
men
and
heard
horses
he
advanced
naturally
expecting
any
moment
to
be
halted
goes
there
came
the
sharp
call
out
of
the
gloom
duane
pulled
his
horse
the
gloom
was
impenetrable
man
alone
replied
duane
stranger
do
you
want
trying
to
find
the
ranger
struck
it
what
your
errand
want
to
see
captain
down
and
advance
slow
do
move
your
hands
it
dark
but
i
can
duane
dismounted
and
leading
his
horse
slowly
advanced
a
few
paces
he
saw
a
dully
bright
object
a
gun
before
he
discovered
the
man
who
held
it
a
few
more
steps
showed
a
dark
figure
blocking
the
trail
here
duane
halted
closer
stranger
let
have
a
look
at
you
the
guard
ordered
curtly
duane
advanced
again
until
he
stood
before
the
man
here
the
rays
of
light
from
the
fires
flickered
upon
duane
face
you
a
stranger
all
right
what
your
name
and
your
business
with
the
captain
duane
hesitated
pondering
what
best
to
say
captain
macnelly
i
the
man
he
been
asking
to
ride
into
his
camp
after
dark
finally
said
duane
the
ranger
bent
forward
to
peer
hard
at
this
night
visitor
his
manner
had
been
alert
and
now
it
became
tense
here
one
of
you
men
quick
he
called
without
turning
in
the
least
toward
the
what
up
pickens
came
the
swift
reply
it
was
followed
by
a
rapid
thud
of
boots
on
soft
ground
a
dark
form
crossed
the
gleams
from
the
then
a
ranger
loomed
up
to
reach
the
side
of
the
guard
duane
heard
whispering
the
purport
of
which
he
could
not
catch
the
second
ranger
swore
under
his
breath
then
he
turned
away
and
started
back
ranger
before
you
go
understand
this
my
visit
is
peaceful
friendly
if
you
let
it
be
mind
i
was
asked
to
come
here
after
duane
clear
penetrating
voice
carried
far
the
listening
rangers
at
the
heard
what
he
said
pickens
tell
that
fellow
to
wait
replied
an
authoritative
voice
then
a
slim
figure
detached
itself
from
the
dark
moving
group
at
the
and
hurried
out
be
foxy
cap
shouted
a
ranger
in
warning
up
all
of
you
was
the
reply
this
officer
obviously
captain
macnelly
soon
joined
the
two
rangers
who
were
confronting
duane
he
had
no
fear
he
strode
straight
up
to
duane
macnelly
he
said
you
my
man
do
mention
your
name
all
this
seemed
so
strange
to
duane
in
keeping
with
much
that
had
happened
lately
met
jeff
aiken
said
duane
sent
me
met
aiken
exclaimed
macnelly
sharp
eager
low
all
that
bully
then
he
appeared
to
catch
himself
to
grow
restrained
fall
back
leave
us
alone
a
the
rangers
slowly
withdrew
duane
it
you
he
whispered
eagerly
i
give
my
word
you
not
be
arrested
you
be
treated
fairly
will
you
come
into
camp
and
consult
with
me
i
sure
glad
to
meet
you
went
on
macnelly
and
he
extended
his
hand
amazed
and
touched
scarcely
realizing
this
actuality
duane
gave
his
hand
and
felt
no
unmistakable
grip
of
warmth
does
seem
natural
captain
macnelly
but
i
believe
i
glad
to
meet
you
said
duane
soberly
will
be
now
we
go
back
to
camp
keep
your
identity
mum
for
the
he
led
duane
in
the
direction
of
the
go
back
on
duty
he
ordered
beeson
you
look
after
this
when
duane
got
beyond
the
line
of
mesquite
which
had
hid
a
good
view
of
the
he
saw
a
group
of
perhaps
fifteen
rangers
sitting
around
the
fires
near
a
long
low
shed
where
horses
were
feeding
and
a
small
adobe
house
at
one
side
just
had
grub
but
i
see
you
get
some
then
we
talk
said
macnelly
taken
up
temporary
quarters
here
have
a
rustler
job
on
hand
now
when
you
eaten
come
right
into
the
duane
was
hungry
but
he
hurried
through
the
ample
supper
that
was
set
before
him
urged
on
by
curiosity
and
astonishment
the
only
way
he
could
account
for
his
presence
there
in
a
ranger
camp
was
that
macnelly
hoped
to
get
useful
information
out
of
him
still
that
would
hardly
have
made
this
captain
so
eager
there
was
a
mystery
here
and
duane
could
scarcely
wait
for
it
to
be
solved
while
eating
he
had
bent
keen
eyes
around
him
after
a
first
quiet
scrutiny
the
rangers
apparently
paid
no
more
attention
to
him
they
were
all
veterans
in
service
duane
saw
that
and
rugged
powerful
men
of
iron
constitution
despite
the
occasional
joke
and
sally
of
the
more
youthful
members
and
a
general
conversation
of
nature
duane
was
not
deceived
about
the
fact
that
his
advent
had
been
an
unusual
and
striking
one
which
had
caused
an
undercurrent
of
conjecture
and
even
consternation
among
them
these
rangers
were
too
well
trained
to
appear
openly
curious
about
their
captain
guest
if
they
had
not
deliberately
attempted
to
be
oblivious
of
his
presence
duane
would
have
concluded
they
thought
him
an
ordinary
visitor
somehow
of
use
to
macnelly
as
it
was
duane
felt
a
suspense
that
must
have
been
due
to
a
hint
of
his
identity
he
was
not
long
in
presenting
himself
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
and
have
a
chair
said
macnelly
motioning
for
the
one
other
occupant
of
the
room
to
rise
us
russell
and
close
the
door
i
be
through
these
reports
right
macnelly
sat
at
a
table
upon
which
was
a
lamp
and
various
papers
seen
in
the
light
he
was
a
soldierly
man
of
about
forty
years
and
with
a
bronzed
face
shrewd
stern
strong
yet
not
wanting
in
kindliness
he
scanned
hastily
over
some
papers
fussed
with
them
and
finally
put
them
in
envelopes
without
looking
up
he
pushed
a
toward
duane
and
upon
duane
refusal
to
smoke
he
took
a
cigar
rose
to
light
it
at
the
and
then
settling
back
in
his
chair
he
faced
duane
making
a
vain
attempt
to
hide
what
must
have
been
the
fulfilment
of
a
curiosity
i
been
hoping
for
this
for
two
years
he
began
duane
smiled
a
little
a
smile
that
felt
strange
on
his
face
he
had
never
been
much
of
a
talker
and
speech
here
seemed
more
than
ordinarily
difficult
macnelly
must
have
felt
that
he
looked
long
and
earnestly
at
duane
and
his
quick
nervous
manner
changed
to
grave
thoughtfulness
lots
to
say
but
where
to
begin
he
mused
you
had
a
hard
life
since
you
went
on
the
dodge
i
never
met
you
before
know
what
you
looked
like
as
a
boy
but
i
can
see
what
well
even
ranger
life
is
all
he
rolled
his
cigar
between
his
lips
and
puffed
clouds
of
smoke
hear
from
home
since
you
left
wellston
he
asked
abruptly
a
word
one
replied
duane
sadly
tough
i
glad
to
be
able
to
tell
you
that
up
to
just
lately
your
mother
sister
uncle
all
your
folks
i
believe
were
well
kept
posted
but
have
heard
duane
averted
his
face
a
moment
hesitated
till
the
swelling
left
his
throat
and
then
said
worth
what
i
went
through
to
hear
can
imagine
how
you
feel
about
it
when
i
was
in
the
war
but
get
down
to
the
business
of
this
he
pulled
his
chair
close
to
duane
had
word
more
than
once
in
the
last
two
years
that
i
wanted
to
see
you
times
i
remember
replied
duane
did
you
hunt
me
up
supposed
you
imagined
me
one
of
those
who
could
take
a
dare
and
expected
me
to
ride
up
to
your
camp
and
be
was
natural
i
suppose
went
on
macnelly
did
know
me
otherwise
you
would
have
come
i
been
a
long
time
getting
to
you
but
the
nature
of
my
job
as
far
as
you
concerned
made
me
cautious
duane
you
aware
of
the
hard
name
you
bear
all
over
the
southwest
in
a
while
i
jarred
into
realizing
replied
duane
the
hardest
barring
murrell
and
cheseldine
on
the
texas
border
but
there
this
difference
murrell
in
his
day
was
known
to
deserve
his
infamous
name
cheseldine
in
his
day
also
but
i
found
hundreds
of
men
in
southwest
texas
who
your
friends
who
swear
you
never
committed
a
crime
the
farther
south
i
get
the
clearer
this
becomes
what
i
want
to
know
is
the
truth
have
you
ever
done
anything
criminal
tell
me
the
truth
duane
it
wo
make
any
difference
in
my
plan
and
when
i
say
crime
i
mean
what
i
would
call
crime
or
any
reasonable
way
my
hands
are
clean
replied
duane
never
held
up
a
man
robbed
a
store
for
grub
stole
a
horse
when
you
needed
him
bad
never
anything
like
that
i
always
kept
out
of
that
just
when
pressed
the
i
damn
glad
macnelly
exclaimed
gripping
duane
hand
for
you
mother
sakel
but
all
the
same
in
spite
of
this
you
are
a
texas
outlaw
accountable
to
the
state
you
perfectly
aware
that
under
existing
circumstances
if
you
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
law
probably
hang
at
least
go
to
jail
for
a
long
what
kept
me
on
the
dodge
all
these
years
replied
duane
macnelly
removed
his
cigar
his
eyes
narrowed
and
glittered
the
muscles
along
his
brown
cheeks
set
hard
and
tense
he
leaned
closer
to
duane
laid
sinewy
pressing
fingers
upon
duane
knee
to
this
he
whispered
hoarsely
i
place
a
pardon
in
your
hand
make
you
a
free
honest
citizen
once
more
clear
your
name
of
infamy
make
your
mother
your
sister
proud
of
you
will
you
swear
yourself
to
a
service
any
service
i
demand
of
you
duane
sat
stock
still
stunned
slowly
more
persuasively
with
show
of
earnest
agitation
captain
macnelly
reiterated
his
startling
query
god
burst
from
duane
this
macnelly
you
ca
be
in
earnest
more
so
in
my
life
i
a
deep
game
i
playing
it
square
what
do
you
say
he
rose
to
his
feet
duane
as
if
impelled
rose
with
him
ranger
and
outlaw
then
locked
eyes
that
searched
each
other
souls
in
duane
read
truth
strong
fiery
purpose
hope
even
gladness
and
a
fugitive
mounting
assurance
of
victory
twice
duane
endeavored
to
speak
failed
of
all
save
a
hoarse
incoherent
sound
until
forcing
back
a
flood
of
speech
he
found
a
voice
service
every
service
macnelly
i
give
my
word
said
duane
a
light
played
over
macnelly
face
warming
out
all
the
grim
darkness
he
held
out
his
hand
duane
met
it
with
his
in
a
clasp
that
men
unconsciously
give
in
moments
of
stress
when
they
unclasped
and
duane
stepped
back
to
drop
into
a
chair
macnelly
fumbled
for
another
cigar
he
had
bitten
the
other
into
shreds
and
lighting
it
as
before
he
turned
to
his
visitor
now
calm
and
cool
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
had
justly
won
something
at
considerable
cost
his
next
move
was
to
take
a
long
leather
case
from
his
pocket
and
extract
from
it
several
folded
papers
your
pardon
from
the
governor
he
said
quietly
see
when
you
look
it
over
that
it
conditional
when
you
sign
this
paper
i
have
here
the
condition
will
be
he
smoothed
out
the
paper
handed
duane
a
pen
ran
his
forefinger
along
a
dotted
line
duane
hand
was
shaky
years
had
passed
since
he
had
held
a
pen
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
achieved
his
signature
buckley
duane
how
strange
the
name
looked
here
ends
the
career
of
buck
duane
outlaw
and
gunfighter
said
macnelly
and
seating
himself
he
took
the
pen
from
duane
fingers
and
wrote
several
lines
in
several
places
upon
the
paper
then
with
a
smile
he
handed
it
to
duane
makes
you
a
member
of
company
a
texas
that
it
burst
out
duane
a
light
breaking
in
upon
his
bewilderment
want
me
for
ranger
service
that
it
replied
the
captain
dryly
to
hear
what
that
service
is
to
be
i
been
a
busy
man
since
i
took
this
job
and
as
you
may
have
heard
i
done
a
few
things
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
political
influence
put
me
in
here
and
that
up
austin
way
there
a
good
deal
of
friction
in
the
department
of
state
in
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
ranger
service
is
any
good
whether
it
should
be
discontinued
or
not
i
on
the
party
side
who
defending
the
ranger
service
i
contend
that
it
made
texas
habitable
well
it
been
up
to
me
to
produce
results
so
far
i
have
been
successful
my
great
ambition
is
to
break
up
the
outlaw
gangs
along
the
river
i
have
never
ventured
in
there
yet
because
i
been
waiting
to
get
the
lieutenant
i
needed
you
of
course
are
the
man
i
had
in
mind
it
my
idea
to
start
way
up
the
rio
grande
and
begin
with
cheseldine
he
the
strongest
the
worst
outlaw
of
the
times
he
more
than
rustler
it
cheseldine
and
his
gang
who
are
operating
on
the
banks
they
doing
that
my
private
opinion
but
it
not
been
backed
up
by
any
evidence
cheseldine
does
leave
evidences
he
intelligent
cunning
no
one
seems
to
have
seen
him
to
know
what
he
looks
like
i
assume
of
course
that
you
are
a
stranger
to
the
country
he
dominates
it
five
hundred
miles
west
of
your
ground
there
a
little
town
over
there
called
fairdale
it
the
nest
of
a
rustler
gang
they
rustle
and
murder
at
will
nobody
knows
who
the
leader
is
i
want
you
to
find
out
well
whatever
way
you
decide
is
best
you
will
proceed
to
act
upon
you
are
your
own
boss
you
know
such
men
and
how
they
can
be
approached
you
will
take
all
the
time
needed
if
it
months
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
communicate
with
me
and
that
will
be
a
difficult
matter
for
cheseldine
dominates
several
whole
counties
you
must
find
some
way
to
let
me
know
when
i
and
my
rangers
are
needed
the
plan
is
to
break
up
cheseldine
gang
it
the
toughest
job
on
the
border
arresting
him
alone
is
to
be
heard
of
he
be
brought
out
killing
him
is
much
better
for
his
select
men
the
ones
he
operates
with
are
as
dangerous
to
the
community
as
he
is
we
want
to
kill
or
jail
this
choice
selection
of
robbers
and
break
up
the
rest
of
the
gang
to
find
them
to
get
among
them
somehow
to
learn
their
movements
to
lay
your
trap
for
us
rangers
to
spring
that
duane
is
your
service
to
me
and
god
knows
it
a
great
one
have
accepted
it
replied
duane
work
will
be
secret
you
are
now
a
ranger
in
my
service
but
no
one
except
the
few
i
choose
to
tell
will
know
of
it
until
we
pull
off
the
job
you
will
simply
be
buck
duane
till
it
suits
our
purpose
to
acquaint
texas
with
the
fact
that
you
a
ranger
you
see
no
date
on
that
paper
no
one
will
ever
know
just
when
you
entered
the
service
perhaps
we
can
make
it
appear
that
all
or
most
of
your
outlawry
has
really
been
good
service
to
the
state
at
that
i
believe
turn
out
macnelly
paused
a
moment
in
his
rapid
talk
chewed
his
cigar
drew
his
brows
together
in
a
dark
frown
and
went
on
man
on
the
border
knows
so
well
as
you
the
deadly
nature
of
this
service
it
a
thousand
to
one
that
you
be
killed
i
say
there
was
no
chance
at
all
for
any
other
man
beside
you
your
reputation
will
go
far
among
the
outlaws
maybe
that
and
your
nerve
and
your
will
pull
you
through
i
hoping
so
but
it
a
long
long
chance
against
your
ever
coming
not
the
point
said
duane
in
case
i
get
killed
out
there
what
that
to
me
interrupted
captain
macnelly
folks
will
know
at
once
of
your
pardon
and
your
ranger
duty
if
you
lose
your
life
out
there
i
see
your
name
cleared
the
service
you
render
known
you
can
rest
assured
of
am
satisfied
replied
duane
so
much
more
than
i
dared
to
it
settled
then
i
give
you
money
for
expenses
start
as
soon
as
you
like
the
sooner
the
better
i
hope
to
think
of
other
suggestions
especially
about
communicating
with
long
after
the
lights
were
out
and
the
low
hum
of
voices
had
ceased
round
the
duane
lay
wide
awake
eyes
staring
into
the
blackness
marveling
over
the
strange
events
of
the
day
he
was
humble
grateful
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
a
huge
and
crushing
burden
had
been
lifted
from
his
heart
he
welcomed
this
hazardous
service
to
the
man
who
had
saved
him
thought
of
his
mother
and
sister
and
uncle
jim
of
his
home
of
old
friends
came
rushing
over
him
the
first
time
in
years
that
he
had
happiness
in
the
memory
the
disgrace
he
had
put
upon
them
would
now
be
removed
and
in
the
light
of
that
his
wasted
life
of
the
past
and
its
probable
tragic
end
in
future
service
as
atonement
changed
their
aspects
and
as
he
lay
there
with
the
approach
of
sleep
finally
dimming
the
vividness
of
his
thought
so
full
of
mystery
shadowy
faces
floated
in
the
blackness
around
him
haunting
him
as
he
had
always
been
haunted
it
was
broad
daylight
when
he
awakened
macnelly
was
calling
him
to
breakfast
outside
sounded
voices
of
men
crackling
of
fires
snorting
and
stamping
of
horses
the
barking
of
dogs
duane
rolled
out
of
his
blankets
and
made
good
use
of
the
soap
and
towel
and
razor
and
brush
near
by
on
a
bench
things
of
rare
luxury
to
an
outlaw
on
the
ride
the
face
he
saw
in
the
mirror
was
as
strange
as
the
past
he
had
tried
so
hard
to
recall
then
he
stepped
to
the
door
and
went
out
the
rangers
were
eating
in
a
circle
round
a
tarpaulin
spread
upon
the
ground
said
macnelly
hands
with
buck
duane
he
on
secret
ranger
service
for
me
service
that
likely
make
you
all
hump
soon
mind
you
keep
mum
about
the
rangers
surprised
duane
with
a
roaring
greeting
the
warmth
of
which
he
soon
divined
was
divided
between
pride
of
his
acquisition
to
their
ranks
and
eagerness
to
meet
that
violent
service
of
which
their
captain
hinted
they
were
jolly
wild
fellows
with
just
enough
gravity
in
their
welcome
to
show
duane
their
respect
and
appreciation
while
not
forgetting
his
record
when
he
had
seated
himself
in
that
circle
now
one
of
them
a
feeling
subtle
and
uplifting
pervaded
him
after
the
meal
captain
macnelly
drew
duane
aside
the
money
make
it
go
as
far
as
you
can
better
strike
straight
for
el
paso
snook
around
there
and
hear
things
then
go
to
valentine

near
the

within
fifty

so

of

but
he
does
hide
all
the
time
in
the
rocks
only
after
some
daring
raid
or
cheseldine
got

stopped
with
an
air
of
finality
and
then
duane
slowly
rose
start
at
once
he
said
extending
his
hand
to
the
captain
wish
i
like
to
thank

do
thank

replied
macnelly
crushing
the
proffered

west
of
the
pecos
river
texas
extended
a
vast
wild
region
barren
in
the
north
where
the
llano
estacado
spread
its
shifting
sands
fertile
in
the
south
along
the
rio
grande
a
railroad
marked
an
undeviating
course
across
five
hundred
miles
of
this
country
and
the
only
villages
and
towns
lay
on
or
near
this
line
of
steel
unsettled
as
was
this
western
texas
and
despite
the
acknowledged
dominance
of
the
outlaw
bands
the
pioneers
pushed
steadily
into
it
first
had
come
the
lone
rancher
then
his
neighbors
in
near
and
far
valleys
then
the
hamlets
at
last
the
railroad
and
the
towns
and
still
the
pioneers
came
spreading
deeper
into
the
valleys
farther
and
wider
over
the
plains
it
was
desert
but
rich
soil
upon
which
water
acted
like
magic
there
was
little
grass
to
an
acre
but
there
were
millions
of
acres
the
climate
was
wonderful
cattle
flourished
and
ranchers
prospered
the
rio
grande
flowed
almost
due
south
along
the
western
boundary
for
a
thousand
miles
and
then
weary
of
its
course
turned
abruptly
north
to
make
what
was
called
the
big
bend
the
railroad
running
west
cut
across
this
bend
and
all
that
country
bounded
on
the
north
by
the
railroad
and
on
the
south
by
the
river
was
as
wild
as
the
staked
plains
it
contained
not
one
settlement
across
the
face
of
this
big
bend
as
if
to
isolate
it
stretched
the
ord
mountain
range
of
which
mount
ord
cathedral
mount
and
elephant
mount
raised
bleak
peaks
above
their
fellows
in
the
valleys
of
the
foothills
and
out
across
the
plains
were
ranches
and
farther
north
villages
and
the
towns
of
alpine
and
marfa
like
other
parts
of
the
great
lone
star
state
this
section
of
texas
was
a
world
in
itself
a
world
where
the
riches
of
the
rancher
were
ever
enriching
the
outlaw
the
village
closest
to
the
gateway
of
this
region
was
a
little
place
called
ord
named
after
the
dark
peak
that
loomed
some
miles
to
the
south
it
had
been
settled
originally
by
mexicans
there
were
still
the
ruins
of
adobe
missions
but
with
the
advent
of
the
rustler
and
outlaw
many
inhabitants
were
shot
or
driven
away
so
that
at
the
height
of
ord
prosperity
and
evil
sway
there
were
but
few
mexicans
living
there
and
these
had
their
choice
between
holding
with
the
outlaws
or
furnishing
target
practice
for
that
wild
element
toward
the
close
of
a
day
in
september
a
stranger
rode
into
ord
and
in
a
community
where
all
men
were
remarkable
for
one
reason
or
another
he
excited
interest
his
horse
perhaps
received
the
first
and
most
engaging
attention
horses
in
that
region
being
apparently
more
important
than
men
this
particular
horse
did
not
attract
with
beauty
at
first
glance
he
seemed
ugly
but
he
was
a
giant
black
as
coal
rough
despite
the
care
manifestly
bestowed
upon
him
long
of
body
ponderous
of
limb
huge
in
every
way
a
bystander
remarked
that
he
had
a
grand
head
true
if
only
his
head
had
been
seen
he
would
have
been
a
beautiful
horse
like
men
horses
show
what
they
are
in
the
shape
the
size
the
line
the
character
of
the
head
this
one
denoted
fire
speed
blood
loyalty
and
his
eyes
were
as
soft
and
dark
as
a
woman
his
face
was
solid
black
except
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
where
there
was
a
round
spot
of
white
mister
mind
tellin
me
his
name
asked
a
ragged
urchin
with
born
love
of
a
horse
in
his
eyes
replied
the
rider
there
fer
the
white
mark
ai
it
whispered
the
youngster
to
another
ai
he
a
whopper
biggest
hoss
i
ever
bullet
carried
a
huge
black
saddle
of
mexican
make
a
lariat
and
canteen
and
a
small
pack
rolled
into
a
tarpaulin
this
rider
apparently
put
all
care
of
appearances
upon
his
horse
his
apparel
was
the
ordinary
jeans
of
the
cowboy
without
vanity
and
it
was
torn
and
his
boots
showed
evidence
of
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
cactus
like
his
horse
this
man
was
a
giant
in
stature
but
rangier
not
so
heavily
built
otherwise
the
only
striking
thing
about
him
was
his
somber
face
with
its
piercing
eyes
and
hair
white
over
the
temples
he
packed
two
guns
both
low
down
but
that
was
too
common
a
thing
to
attract
notice
in
the
big
bend
a
close
observer
however
would
have
noted
a
singular
fact
this
rider
right
hand
was
more
bronzed
more
than
his
left
he
never
wore
a
glove
on
that
right
hand
he
had
dismounted
before
a
ramshackle
structure
that
bore
upon
its
wide
front
the
sign
there
were
horsemen
coming
and
going
down
the
wide
street
between
its
rows
of
old
stores
saloons
and
houses
ord
certainly
did
not
look
enterprising
americans
had
manifestly
assimilated
much
of
the
leisure
of
the
mexicans
the
hotel
had
a
wide
platform
in
front
and
this
did
duty
as
porch
and
sidewalk
upon
it
and
leaning
against
a
were
men
of
varying
ages
most
of
them
slovenly
in
old
jeans
and
slouched
sombreros
some
were
booted
belted
and
spurred
no
man
there
wore
a
coat
but
all
wore
vests
the
guns
in
that
group
would
have
outnumbered
the
men
it
was
a
crowd
seemingly
too
lazy
to
be
curious
good
nature
did
not
appear
to
be
wanting
but
it
was
not
the
frank
and
boisterous
kind
natural
to
the
cowboy
or
rancher
in
town
for
a
day
these
men
were
idlers
what
else
perhaps
was
easy
to
conjecture
certainly
to
this
arriving
stranger
who
flashed
a
keen
eye
over
them
they
wore
an
atmosphere
never
associated
with
work
presently
a
tall
man
with
a
drooping
sandy
mustache
leisurely
detached
himself
from
the
crowd
stranger
he
said
the
stranger
had
bent
over
to
loosen
the
cinches
he
straightened
up
and
nodded
then
thirsty
that
brought
a
broad
smile
to
faces
it
was
characteristic
greeting
one
and
all
trooped
after
the
stranger
into
the
hotel
it
was
a
dark
barn
of
a
place
with
a
bar
as
high
as
a
short
man
head
a
bartender
with
a
scarred
face
was
serving
drinks
up
gents
said
the
stranger
they
piled
over
one
another
to
get
to
the
bar
with
coarse
jests
and
oaths
and
laughter
none
of
them
noted
that
the
stranger
did
not
appear
so
thirsty
as
he
had
claimed
to
be
in
fact
though
he
went
through
the
motions
he
did
not
drink
at
all
name
jim
fletcher
said
the
tall
man
with
the
drooping
sandy
mustache
he
spoke
laconically
nevertheless
there
was
a
tone
that
showed
he
expected
to
be
known
something
went
with
that
name
the
stranger
did
not
appear
to
be
impressed
name
might
be
blazes
but
it
ai
he
replied
do
you
call
this
burg
this
heah
bears
the
handle
ord
is
thet
new
to
you
he
leaned
back
against
the
bar
and
now
his
little
yellow
eyes
clear
as
crystal
flawless
as
a
hawk
fixed
on
the
stranger
other
men
crowded
close
forming
a
circle
curious
ready
to
be
friendly
or
otherwise
according
to
how
the
tall
interrogator
marked
the
ord
a
little
strange
to
me
off
the
railroad
some
ai
it
funny
trails
fur
was
you
goin
reckon
i
was
goin
as
far
as
i
could
replied
the
stranger
with
a
hard
laugh
his
reply
had
subtle
reaction
on
that
listening
circle
some
of
the
men
exchanged
glances
fletcher
stroked
his
drooping
mustache
seemed
thoughtful
but
lost
something
of
that
piercing
scrutiny
ord
the
place
he
said
presently
heerd
of
the
big
bend
country
sure
have
an
was
makin
tracks
fer
it
replied
the
stranger
fletcher
turned
toward
a
man
in
the
outer
edge
of
the
group
come
in
this
individual
elbowed
his
way
in
and
was
seen
to
be
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
almost
pale
beside
those
bronzed
men
with
a
long
expressionless
face
thin
and
sharp
this
heah
fletcher
wheeled
to
the
stranger
you
call
yourself
hate
to
mention
what
i
been
callin
myself
this
sally
fetched
another
laugh
the
stranger
appeared
cool
careless
indifferent
perhaps
he
knew
as
the
others
present
knew
that
this
show
of
fletcher
this
pretense
of
introduction
was
merely
talk
while
he
was
looked
over
knell
stepped
up
and
it
was
easy
to
see
from
the
way
fletcher
relinquished
his
part
in
the
situation
that
a
man
greater
than
he
had
appeared
upon
the
scene
business
here
he
queried
curtly
when
he
spoke
his
expressionless
face
was
in
strange
contrast
with
the
ring
the
quality
the
cruelty
of
his
voice
this
voice
betrayed
an
absence
of
humor
of
friendliness
of
heart
replied
the
stranger
anybody
hereabouts
ridin
through
fer
back
country
eh
there
came
a
pause
the
stranger
appeared
to
grow
a
little
resentful
and
drew
himself
up
disdainfully
considerin
seem
so
damn
friendly
an
oncurious
down
here
in
this
big
bend
country
i
do
mind
sayin
yes
i
am
in
on
the
dodge
he
replied
with
deliberate
sarcasm
west
of
ord
out
el

mebbe
thet
so
knell
words
cut
the
air
stilled
the
room
from
way
down
the
river
thet
what
they
say
down
there
the
stranger
you
a
liar
with
swift
clink
of
spur
and
thump
of
boot
the
crowd
split
leaving
knell
and
the
stranger
in
the
center
wild
breed
of
that
ilk
never
made
a
mistake
in
judging
a
man
nerve
knell
had
cut
out
with
the
trenchant
call
and
stood
ready
the
stranger
suddenly
lost
his
every
semblance
to
the
rough
and
easy
character
before
manifest
in
him
he
became
bronze
that
situation
seemed
familiar
to
him
his
eyes
held
a
singular
piercing
light
that
danced
like
a
i
lied
he
said
i
ai
takin
offense
at
the
way
you
called
me
i
lookin
to
make
friends
not
enemies
you
do
strike
me
as
one
of
them
achin
to
kill
somebody
but
if
you
are
go
ahead
an
open
the
ball
you
see
i
never
throw
a
gun
on
them
fellers
till
they
go
fer
knell
coolly
eyed
his
antagonist
his
strange
face
not
changing
in
the
least
yet
somehow
it
was
evident
in
his
look
that
here
was
metal
which
rang
differently
from
what
he
had
expected
invited
to
start
a
fight
or
withdraw
as
he
chose
knell
proved
himself
big
in
the
manner
characteristic
of
only
the
genuine
gunman
i
pass
he
said
and
turning
to
the
bar
he
ordered
liquor
the
tension
relaxed
the
silence
broke
the
men
filled
up
the
gap
the
incident
seemed
closed
jim
fletcher
attached
himself
to
the
stranger
and
now
both
respect
and
friendliness
tempered
his
asperity
fer
want
of
a
better
handle
i
call
you
dodge
he
said
as
good
as
any
gents
line
up
again
an
if
you
ca
be
friendly
be
careful
such
was
buck
duane
debut
in
the
little
outlaw
hamlet
of
ord
duane
had
been
three
months
out
of
the
nueces
country
at
el
paso
he
bought
the
finest
horse
he
could
find
and
armed
and
otherwise
outfitted
to
suit
him
he
had
taken
to
unknown
trails
leisurely
he
rode
from
town
to
town
village
to
village
ranch
to
ranch
fitting
his
talk
and
his
occupation
to
the
impression
he
wanted
to
make
upon
different
people
whom
he
met
he
was
in
turn
a
cowboy
a
rancher
a
cattleman
a
a
boomer
a
and
long
before
he
reached
the
wild
and
inhospitable
ord
he
had
acted
the
part
of
an
outlaw
drifting
into
new
territory
he
passed
on
leisurely
because
he
wanted
to
learn
the
lay
of
the
country
the
location
of
villages
and
ranches
the
work
habit
gossip
pleasures
and
fears
of
the
people
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
the
one
subject
most
impelling
to
him
outlaws
he
never
mentioned
but
by
talking
all
around
it
sifting
the
old
ranch
and
cattle
story
he
acquired
a
knowledge
calculated
to
aid
his
plot
in
this
game
time
was
of
no
moment
if
necessary
he
would
take
years
to
accomplish
his
task
the
stupendous
and
perilous
nature
of
it
showed
in
the
slow
wary
preparation
when
he
heard
fletcher
name
and
faced
knell
he
knew
he
had
reached
the
place
he
sought
ord
was
a
hamlet
on
the
fringe
of
the
grazing
country
of
doubtful
honesty
from
which
surely
winding
trails
led
down
into
that
free
and
paradise
of
outlaws
the
big
bend
duane
made
himself
agreeable
yet
not
too
much
so
to
fletcher
and
several
other
men
disposed
to
talk
and
drink
and
eat
and
then
after
having
a
care
for
his
horse
he
rode
out
of
town
a
couple
of
miles
to
a
grove
he
had
marked
and
there
well
hidden
he
prepared
to
spend
the
night
this
proceeding
served
a
double
purpose
he
was
safer
and
the
habit
would
look
well
in
the
eyes
of
outlaws
who
would
be
more
inclined
to
see
in
him
the
fugitive
long
since
duane
had
fought
out
a
battle
with
himself
won
a
victory
his
outer
life
the
action
was
much
the
same
as
it
had
been
but
the
inner
life
had
tremendously
changed
he
could
never
become
a
happy
man
he
could
never
shake
utterly
those
haunting
phantoms
that
had
once
been
his
despair
and
madness
but
he
had
assumed
a
task
impossible
for
any
man
save
one
like
him
he
had
felt
the
meaning
of
it
grow
strangely
and
wonderfully
and
through
that
flourished
up
consciousness
of
how
passionately
he
now
clung
to
this
thing
which
would
blot
out
his
former
infamy
the
iron
fetters
no
more
threatened
his
hands
the
iron
door
no
more
haunted
his
dreams
he
never
forgot
that
he
was
free
strangely
too
along
with
this
feeling
of
new
manhood
there
gathered
the
force
of
imperious
desire
to
run
these
chief
outlaws
to
their
dooms
he
never
called
them
outlaws
but
rustlers
thieves
robbers
murderers
criminals
he
sensed
the
growth
of
a
relentless
driving
passion
and
sometimes
he
feared
that
more
than
the
newly
acquired
zeal
and
pride
in
this
ranger
service
it
was
the
old
terrible
inherited
killing
instinct
lifting
its
in
new
guise
but
of
that
he
could
not
be
sure
he
dreaded
the
thought
he
could
only
wait
another
aspect
of
the
change
in
duane
neither
passionate
nor
driving
yet
not
improbably
even
more
potent
of
new
significance
to
life
was
the
imperceptible
return
of
an
old
love
of
nature
dead
during
his
outlaw
days
for
years
a
horse
had
been
only
a
machine
of
locomotion
to
carry
him
from
place
to
place
to
beat
and
spur
and
goad
mercilessly
in
flight
now
this
giant
black
with
his
splendid
head
was
a
companion
a
friend
a
brother
a
loved
thing
guarded
jealously
fed
and
trained
and
ridden
with
an
intense
appreciation
of
his
great
speed
and
endurance
for
years
the
daytime
with
its
birth
of
sunrise
on
through
long
hours
to
the
ruddy
close
had
been
used
for
sleep
or
rest
in
some
rocky
hole
or
willow
brake
or
deserted
hut
had
been
hated
because
it
augmented
danger
of
pursuit
because
it
drove
the
fugitive
to
lonely
wretched
hiding
now
the
dawn
was
a
greeting
a
promise
of
another
day
to
ride
to
plan
to
remember
and
sun
wind
cloud
rain
sky
all
were
joys
to
him
somehow
speaking
his
freedom
for
years
the
night
had
been
a
black
space
during
which
he
had
to
ride
unseen
along
the
endless
trails
to
peer
with
through
gloom
for
the
moving
shape
that
ever
pursued
him
now
the
twilight
and
the
dusk
and
the
shadows
of
grove
and
canyon
darkened
into
night
with
its
train
of
stars
and
brought
him
calm
reflection
of
the
day
happenings
of
the
morrow
possibilities
perhaps
a
sad
brief
procession
of
the
old
phantoms
then
sleep
for
years
canyons
and
valleys
and
mountains
had
been
looked
at
as
retreats
that
might
be
dark
and
wild
enough
to
hide
even
an
outlaw
now
he
saw
these
features
of
the
great
desert
with
something
of
the
eyes
of
the
boy
who
had
once
burned
for
adventure
and
life
among
them
this
night
a
wonderful
afterglow
lingered
long
in
the
west
and
against
the
of
clear
sky
the
bold
black
head
of
mount
ord
reared
itself
aloft
beautiful
but
aloof
sinister
yet
calling
small
wonder
that
duane
gazed
in
fascination
upon
the
peak
somewhere
deep
in
its
corrugated
sides
or
lost
in
a
rugged
canyon
was
hidden
the
secret
stronghold
of
the
master
outlaw
cheseldine
all
down
along
the
ride
from
el
paso
duane
had
heard
of
cheseldine
of
his
band
his
fearful
deeds
his
cunning
his
widely
separated
raids
of
his
flitting
here
and
there
like
a
but
never
a
word
of
his
den
never
a
word
of
his
appearance
next
morning
duane
did
not
return
to
ord
he
struck
off
to
the
north
riding
down
a
rough
road
that
appeared
to
have
been
used
occasionally
for
as
he
had
ridden
in
from
the
west
this
northern
direction
led
him
into
totally
unfamiliar
country
while
he
passed
on
however
he
exercised
such
keen
observation
that
in
the
future
he
would
know
whatever
might
be
of
service
to
him
if
he
chanced
that
way
again
the
rough
wild
slope
down
from
the
foothills
gradually
leveled
out
into
plain
a
magnificent
grazing
country
upon
which
till
noon
of
that
day
duane
did
not
see
a
herd
of
cattle
or
a
ranch
about
that
time
he
made
out
smoke
from
the
railroad
and
after
a
couple
of
hours
riding
he
entered
a
town
which
inquiry
discovered
to
be
bradford
it
was
the
largest
town
he
had
visited
since
marfa
and
he
calculated
must
have
a
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
inhabitants
not
including
mexicans
he
decided
this
would
be
a
good
place
for
him
to
hold
up
for
a
while
being
the
nearest
town
to
ord
only
forty
miles
away
so
he
hitched
his
horse
in
front
of
a
store
and
leisurely
set
about
studying
bradford
it
was
after
dark
however
that
duane
verified
his
suspicions
concerning
bradford
the
town
was
awake
after
dark
and
there
was
one
long
row
of
saloons
in
full
blast
duane
visited
them
all
and
was
surprised
to
see
wildness
and
license
equal
to
that
of
the
old
river
camp
of
bland
in
its
palmiest
days
here
it
was
forced
upon
him
that
the
farther
west
one
traveled
along
the
river
the
sparser
the
respectable
settlements
the
more
numerous
the
hard
characters
and
in
consequence
the
greater
the
element
of
lawlessness
duane
returned
to
his
with
the
conviction
that
task
of
cleaning
up
the
big
bend
country
was
a
stupendous
one
yet
he
reflected
a
company
of
intrepid
and
rangers
could
have
soon
cleaned
up
this
bradford
the
innkeeper
had
one
other
guest
that
night
a
long
and
texan
who
reminded
duane
of
his
grandfather
this
man
had
penetrating
eyes
a
courtly
manner
and
an
unmistakable
leaning
toward
companionship
and
the
gentleman
introduced
himself
as
colonel
webb
of
marfa
and
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
duane
made
no
comment
about
himself
it
all
one
to
me
he
said
blandly
waving
his
hand
have
traveled
texas
is
free
and
this
frontier
is
one
where
it
healthier
and
just
as
friendly
for
a
man
to
have
no
curiosity
about
his
companion
you
might
be
cheseldine
of
the
big
bend
or
you
might
be
judge
little
of
el
all
one
to
me
i
enjoy
drinking
with
you
duane
thanked
him
conscious
of
a
reserve
and
dignity
that
he
could
not
have
felt
or
pretended
three
months
before
and
then
as
always
he
was
a
good
listener
colonel
webb
told
among
other
things
that
he
had
come
out
to
the
big
bend
to
look
over
the
affairs
of
a
deceased
brother
who
had
been
a
rancher
and
a
sheriff
of
one
of
the
towns
fairdale
by
name
no
affairs
no
ranch
not
even
his
grave
said
colonel
webb
i
tell
you
sir
if
hell
any
tougher
than
this
fairdale
i
want
to
expiate
my
sins
i
imagine
sheriffs
have
a
hard
row
to
hoe
out
here
replied
duane
trying
not
to
appear
curious
the
colonel
swore
lustily
brother
was
the
only
honest
sheriff
fairdale
ever
had
it
was
wonderful
how
long
he
lasted
but
he
had
nerve
he
could
throw
a
gun
and
he
was
on
the
square
then
he
was
wise
enough
to
confine
his
work
to
offenders
of
his
own
town
and
neighborhood
he
let
the
riding
outlaws
alone
else
he
would
have
lasted
at
all
what
this
frontier
needs
sir
is
about
six
companies
of
texas
duane
was
aware
of
the
colonel
close
scrutiny
you
know
anything
about
the
service
he
asked
used
to
ten
years
ago
when
i
lived
in
san
antonio
a
fine
body
of
men
sir
and
the
salvation
of
stone
does
entertain
that
opinion
said
duane
here
colonel
webb
exploded
manifestly
the
governor
was
not
his
choice
for
a
chief
executive
of
the
great
state
he
talked
politics
for
a
while
and
of
the
vast
territory
west
of
the
pecos
that
seemed
never
to
get
a
benefit
from
austin
he
talked
enough
for
duane
to
realize
that
here
was
just
the
kind
of
intelligent
honest
citizen
that
he
had
been
trying
to
meet
he
exerted
himself
thereafter
to
be
agreeable
and
interesting
and
he
saw
presently
that
here
was
an
opportunity
to
make
a
valuable
acquaintance
if
not
a
friend
a
stranger
in
these
parts
said
duane
finally
is
this
outlaw
situation
you
speak
of
damnable
sir
and
unbelievable
not
rustling
any
more
but
just
wholesale
in
which
some
big
cattlemen
supposed
to
be
honest
are
equally
guilty
with
the
outlaws
on
this
border
you
know
the
rustler
has
always
been
able
to
steal
cattle
in
any
numbers
but
to
get
rid
of
big
bunches
that
the
hard
job
the
gang
operating
between
here
and
valentine
evidently
have
not
this
trouble
nobody
knows
where
the
stolen
stock
goes
but
i
not
alone
in
my
opinion
that
most
of
it
goes
to
several
big
stockmen
they
ship
to
san
antonio
austin
new
orleans
also
to
el
paso
if
you
travel
the
between
here
and
marfa
and
valentine
you
see
dead
cattle
all
along
the
line
and
stray
cattle
out
in
the
scrub
the
herds
have
been
driven
fast
and
far
and
stragglers
are
not
rounded
business
eh
remarked
duane
are
these
er
big
colonel
webb
seemed
a
little
startled
at
the
abrupt
query
he
bent
his
penetrating
gaze
upon
duane
and
thoughtfully
stroked
his
pointed
beard
of
course
i
not
mention
opinions
are
one
thing
direct
accusation
another
this
is
not
a
healthy
country
for
the
when
it
came
to
the
outlaws
themselves
colonel
webb
was
disposed
to
talk
freely
duane
could
not
judge
whether
the
colonel
had
a
hobby
of
that
subject
or
the
outlaws
were
so
striking
in
personality
and
deed
that
any
man
would
know
all
about
them
the
great
name
along
the
river
was
cheseldine
but
it
seemed
to
be
a
name
detached
from
an
individual
no
person
of
veracity
known
to
colonel
webb
had
ever
seen
cheseldine
and
those
who
claimed
that
doubtful
honor
varied
so
diversely
in
descriptions
of
the
chief
that
they
confused
the
reality
and
lent
to
the
outlaw
only
further
mystery
strange
to
say
of
an
outlaw
leader
as
there
was
no
one
who
could
identify
him
so
there
was
no
one
who
could
prove
he
had
actually
killed
a
man
blood
flowed
like
water
over
the
big
bend
country
and
it
was
cheseldine
who
spilled
it
yet
the
fact
remained
there
were
no
to
connect
any
individual
called
cheseldine
with
these
deeds
of
violence
but
in
striking
contrast
to
this
mystery
was
the
person
character
and
action
of
poggin
and
knell
the
chief
lieutenants
they
were
familiar
figures
in
all
the
towns
within
two
hundred
miles
of
bradford
knell
had
a
record
but
as
gunman
with
an
incredible
list
of
victims
poggin
was
supreme
if
poggin
had
a
friend
no
one
ever
heard
of
him
there
were
a
hundred
stories
of
his
nerve
his
wonderful
speed
with
a
gun
his
passion
for
gambling
his
love
of
a
horse
his
cold
implacable
inhuman
wiping
out
of
his
path
any
man
that
crossed
it
is
a
name
a
terrible
name
said
colonel
webb
i
wonder
if
he
not
only
a
name
in
that
case
where
does
the
brains
of
this
gang
come
from
no
there
must
be
a
master
craftsman
behind
this
border
pillage
a
master
capable
of
handling
those
terrors
poggin
and
knell
of
all
the
thousands
of
outlaws
developed
by
western
texas
in
the
last
twenty
years
these
three
are
the
greatest
in
southern
texas
down
between
the
pecos
and
the
nueces
there
have
been
and
are
still
many
bad
men
but
i
doubt
if
any
outlaw
there
possibly
excepting
buck
duane
ever
equaled
poggin
you
heard
of
this
duane
a
little
replied
duane
quietly
from
southern
texas
buck
duane
then
is
known
out
here
man
where
is
his
name
known
returned
colonel
webb
kept
track
of
his
record
as
i
have
all
the
others
of
course
duane
being
a
lone
outlaw
is
somewhat
of
a
mystery
also
but
not
like
cheseldine
out
here
there
have
drifted
many
stories
of
duane
horrible
some
of
them
but
despite
them
a
sort
of
romance
clings
to
that
nueces
outlaw
he
killed
three
great
outlaw
leaders
i
believe
bland
hardin
and
the
other
i
forgot
hardin
was
known
in
the
big
bend
had
friends
there
bland
had
a
hard
name
at
del
this
man
duane
enjoys
rather
an
unusual
repute
west
of
the
pecos
inquired
duane
considered
more
of
an
enemy
to
his
kind
than
to
honest
men
i
understand
duane
had
many
friends
that
whole
counties
swear
by
him
secretly
of
course
for
he
a
hunted
outlaw
with
rewards
on
his
head
his
fame
in
this
country
appears
to
hang
on
his
matchless
and
his
enmity
toward
outlaw
chiefs
i
heard
many
a
rancher
say
wish
to
god
that
buck
duane
would
drift
out
here
i
give
a
hundred
pesos
to
see
him
and
poggin
meet
it
a
singular
thing
stranger
how
jealous
these
great
outlaws
are
of
each
indeed
all
about
them
is
singular
replied
duane
cheseldine
gang
been
busy
lately
this
section
has
been
free
of
rustling
for
months
though
unexplained
movements
of
stock
probably
all
the
stock
that
being
shipped
now
was
rustled
long
ago
cheseldine
works
over
a
wide
section
too
wide
for
news
to
travel
inside
of
weeks
then
sometimes
he
not
heard
of
at
all
for
a
spell
these
lulls
are
pretty
surely
indicative
of
a
big
storm
sooner
or
later
and
cheseldine
deals
as
they
grow
fewer
and
farther
between
certainly
get
bigger
more
daring
there
are
some
people
who
think
cheseldine
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
and
during
the
last
few
years
in
this
country
but
poor
reasoning
the
jobs
have
been
too
well
done
too
surely
covered
to
be
the
work
of
greasers
or
ordinary
your
view
of
the
outlook
how
all
this
going
to
wind
up
will
the
outlaw
ever
be
driven
out
asked
duane
there
will
always
be
outlaws
along
the
rio
grande
all
the
armies
in
the
world
could
comb
the
wild
brakes
of
that
fifteen
hundred
miles
of
river
but
the
sway
of
the
outlaw
such
as
is
enjoyed
by
these
great
leaders
will
sooner
or
later
be
past
the
criminal
element
flock
to
the
southwest
but
not
so
thick
and
fast
as
the
pioneers
besides
the
outlaws
kill
themselves
and
the
ranchers
are
slowly
rising
in
wrath
if
not
in
action
that
will
come
soon
if
they
only
had
a
leader
to
start
the
fight
but
that
will
come
there
talk
of
vigilantes
the
same
hat
were
organized
in
california
and
are
now
in
force
in
idaho
so
far
it
only
talk
but
the
time
will
come
and
the
days
of
cheseldine
and
poggin
are
duane
went
to
bed
that
night
exceedingly
thoughtful
the
long
trail
was
growing
hot
this
voluble
colonel
had
given
him
new
ideas
it
came
to
duane
in
surprise
that
he
was
famous
along
the
upper
rio
grande
assuredly
he
would
not
long
be
able
to
conceal
his
identity
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
would
soon
meet
the
chiefs
of
this
clever
and
bold
rustling
gang
he
could
not
decide
whether
he
would
be
safer
unknown
or
known
in
the
latter
case
his
one
chance
lay
in
the
fatality
connected
with
his
name
in
his
power
to
look
it
and
act
it
duane
had
never
dreamed
of
any
tendency
in
his
nature
but
now
he
felt
something
like
one
above
all
others
his
mind
fixed
on
poggin
poggin
the
brute
the
executor
of
cheseldine
will
but
mostly
upon
poggin
the
gunman
this
in
itself
was
a
warning
to
duane
he
felt
terrible
forces
at
work
within
him
there
was
the
stern
and
indomitable
resolve
to
make
macnelly
boast
good
to
the
governor
of
the
state
to
break
up
cheseldine
gang
yet
this
was
not
in
duane
mind
before
a
strange
grim
and
deadly
instinct
which
he
had
to
drive
away
for
fear
he
would
find
in
it
a
passion
to
kill
poggin
not
for
the
state
nor
for
his
word
to
macnelly
but
for
himself
had
his
father
blood
and
the
hard
years
made
duane
the
kind
of
man
who
instinctively
wanted
to
meet
poggin
he
was
sworn
to
macnelly
service
and
he
fought
himself
to
keep
that
and
that
only
in
his
mind
duane
ascertained
that
fairdale
was
situated
two
days
ride
from
bradford
toward
the
north
there
was
a
stage
which
made
the
journey
twice
a
week
next
morning
duane
mounted
his
horse
and
headed
for
fairdale
he
rode
leisurely
as
he
wanted
to
learn
all
he
could
about
the
country
there
were
few
ranches
the
farther
he
traveled
the
better
grazing
he
encountered
and
strange
to
note
the
fewer
herds
of
cattle
it
was
just
sunset
when
he
made
out
a
cluster
of
adobe
houses
that
marked
the
point
between
bradford
and
fairdale
here
duane
had
learned
was
stationed
a
comfortable
inn
for
wayfarers
when
he
drew
up
before
the
inn
the
landlord
and
his
family
and
a
number
of
loungers
greeted
him
laconically
the
stage
in
hey
remarked
one
she
comes
now
said
another
shore
is
drivin
far
down
the
road
duane
saw
a
cloud
of
dust
and
horses
and
a
lumbering
coach
when
he
had
looked
after
the
needs
of
his
horse
he
returned
to
the
group
before
the
inn
they
awaited
the
stage
with
that
interest
common
to
isolated
people
presently
it
rolled
up
a
large
and
dusty
vehicle
littered
with
baggage
on
top
and
tied
on
behind
a
number
of
passengers
alighted
three
of
whom
excited
duane
interest
one
was
a
tall
dark
man
and
the
other
two
were
ladies
wearing
long
gray
ulsters
and
veils
duane
heard
the
proprietor
of
the
inn
address
the
man
as
colonel
longstreth
and
as
the
party
entered
the
inn
duane
quick
ears
caught
a
few
words
which
acquainted
him
with
the
fact
that
longstreth
was
the
mayor
of
fairdale
duane
passed
inside
himself
to
learn
that
supper
would
soon
be
ready
at
table
he
found
himself
opposite
the
three
who
had
attracted
his
attention
i
envy
the
lucky
cowboys
longstreth
was
saying
ruth
was
a
girl
with
gray
or
hazel
eyes
crazy
to
ride
bronchos
she
said
duane
gathered
she
was
on
a
visit
to
western
texas
the
other
deep
voice
sweet
like
a
bell
made
duane
regard
her
closer
she
had
beauty
as
he
had
never
seen
it
in
another
woman
she
was
slender
but
the
development
of
her
figure
gave
duane
the
impression
she
was
twenty
years
old
or
more
she
had
the
most
exquisite
hands
duane
had
ever
seen
she
did
not
resemble
the
colonel
who
was
evidently
her
father
she
looked
tired
quiet
even
melancholy
a
finely
chiseled
oval
face
clear
skin
long
eyes
set
wide
apart
and
black
as
coal
beautiful
to
look
into
a
slender
straight
nose
that
had
something
nervous
and
delicate
about
it
which
made
duane
think
of
a
thoroughbred
and
a
mouth
by
no
means
small
but
perfectly
curved
and
hair
like
jet
all
these
features
proclaimed
her
beauty
to
duane
duane
believed
her
a
descendant
of
one
of
the
old
french
families
of
eastern
texas
he
was
sure
of
it
when
she
looked
at
him
drawn
by
his
rather
persistent
gaze
there
were
pride
fire
and
passion
in
her
eyes
duane
felt
himself
blushing
in
confusion
his
stare
at
her
had
been
rude
perhaps
but
unconscious
how
many
years
had
passed
since
he
had
seen
a
girl
like
her
thereafter
he
kept
his
eyes
upon
his
plate
yet
he
seemed
to
be
aware
that
he
had
aroused
the
interest
of
both
girls
after
supper
the
guests
assembled
in
a
big
where
an
open
fire
place
with
blazing
mesquite
sticks
gave
out
warmth
and
cheery
glow
duane
took
a
seat
by
a
table
in
the
corner
and
finding
a
paper
began
to
read
presently
when
he
glanced
up
he
saw
two
men
strangers
who
had
not
appeared
before
and
were
peering
in
from
a
doorway
when
they
saw
duane
had
observed
them
they
stepped
back
out
of
sight
it
flashed
over
duane
that
the
strangers
acted
suspiciously
in
texas
in
the
seventies
it
was
always
bad
policy
to
let
strangers
go
unheeded
duane
pondered
a
moment
then
he
went
out
to
look
over
these
two
men
the
doorway
opened
into
a
patio
and
across
that
was
a
little
dingy
here
duane
found
the
innkeeper
dispensing
drinks
to
the
two
strangers
they
glanced
up
when
he
entered
and
one
of
them
whispered
he
imagined
he
had
seen
one
of
them
before
in
texas
where
outdoor
men
were
so
rough
bronzed
bold
and
sometimes
grim
of
aspect
it
was
no
easy
task
to
pick
out
the
crooked
ones
but
duane
years
on
the
border
had
augmented
a
natural
instinct
or
gift
to
read
character
or
at
least
to
sense
the
evil
in
men
and
he
knew
at
once
that
these
strangers
were
dishonest
somethin
one
of
them
asked
leering
both
looked
duane
up
and
down
thanks
i
do
drink
duane
replied
and
returned
their
scrutiny
with
interest
tricks
in
the
big
bend
both
men
stared
it
had
taken
only
a
close
glance
for
duane
to
recognize
a
type
of
ruffian
most
frequently
met
along
the
river
these
strangers
had
that
stamp
and
their
surprise
proved
he
was
right
here
the
innkeeper
showed
signs
of
uneasiness
and
seconded
the
surprise
of
his
customers
no
more
was
said
at
the
instant
and
the
two
rather
hurriedly
went
out
boss
do
you
know
those
fellows
duane
asked
the
innkeeper
way
did
they
come
i
think
of
it
them
fellers
rid
in
from
both
corners
today
he
replied
and
he
put
both
hands
on
the
bar
and
looked
at
duane
nooned
heah
comin
from
bradford
they
said
an
trailed
in
after
the
when
duane
returned
to
the
colonel
longstreth
was
absent
also
several
of
the
other
passengers
miss
ruth
sat
in
the
chair
he
had
vacated
and
across
the
table
from
her
sat
miss
longstreth
duane
went
directly
to
them
me
said
duane
addressing
them
want
to
tell
you
there
are
a
couple
of
men
here
i
just
seen
them
they
mean
evil
tell
your
father
to
be
careful
lock
your
doors
bar
your
windows
cried
ruth
very
low
do
you
hear
you
we
be
careful
said
miss
longstreth
gracefully
the
rich
color
had
faded
in
her
cheek
saw
those
men
watching
you
from
that
door
they
had
such
bright
black
eyes
is
there
really
danger
here
think
so
was
duane
reply
soft
swift
steps
behind
him
preceded
a
harsh
voice
up
no
man
quicker
than
duane
to
recognize
the
intent
in
those
words
his
hands
shot
up
miss
ruth
uttered
a
little
frightened
cry
and
sank
into
her
chair
miss
longstreth
turned
white
her
eyes
dilated
both
girls
were
staring
at
some
one
behind
duane
around
ordered
the
harsh
voice
the
big
dark
stranger
the
bearded
one
who
had
whispered
to
his
comrade
in
the
and
asked
duane
to
drink
had
him
covered
with
a
cocked
gun
he
strode
forward
his
eyes
gleaming
pressed
the
gun
against
him
and
with
his
other
hand
dove
into
his
inside
coat
pocket
and
tore
out
his
roll
of
bills
then
he
reached
low
at
duane
hip
felt
his
gun
and
took
it
then
he
slapped
the
other
hip
evidently
in
search
of
another
weapon
that
done
he
backed
away
wearing
an
expression
of
fiendish
satisfaction
that
made
duane
think
he
was
only
a
common
thief
a
novice
at
this
kind
of
game
his
comrade
stood
in
the
door
with
a
gun
leveled
at
two
other
men
who
stood
there
frightened
speechless
a
move
on
bill
called
this
fellow
and
he
took
a
hasty
glance
backward
a
stamp
of
hoofs
came
from
outside
of
course
the
robbers
had
horses
waiting
the
one
called
bill
strode
across
the
room
and
with
brutal
careless
haste
began
to
prod
the
two
men
with
his
weapon
and
to
search
them
the
robber
in
the
doorway
called
and
disappeared
duane
wondered
where
the
innkeeper
was
and
colonel
longstreth
and
the
other
two
passengers
the
bearded
robber
quickly
got
through
with
his
searching
and
from
his
growls
duane
gathered
he
had
not
been
well
remunerated
then
he
wheeled
once
more
duane
had
not
moved
a
muscle
stood
perfectly
calm
with
his
arms
high
the
robber
strode
back
with
his
bloodshot
eyes
fastened
upon
the
girls
miss
longstreth
never
flinched
but
the
little
girl
appeared
about
to
faint
yap
there
he
said
low
and
hard
he
thrust
the
gun
close
to
ruth
then
duane
knew
for
sure
that
he
was
no
knight
of
the
road
but
a
plain
cutthroat
robber
danger
always
made
duane
exult
in
a
kind
of
cold
glow
but
now
something
hot
worked
within
him
he
had
a
little
gun
in
his
pocket
the
robber
had
missed
it
and
he
began
to
calculate
chances
money
jewelry
diamonds
ordered
the
ruffian
fiercely
miss
ruth
collapsed
then
he
made
at
miss
longstreth
she
stood
with
her
hands
at
her
breast
evidently
the
robber
took
this
position
to
mean
that
she
had
valuables
concealed
there
but
duane
fancied
she
had
instinctively
pressed
her
hands
against
a
throbbing
heart
out
with
it
he
said
harshly
reaching
for
her
dare
touch
me
she
cried
her
eyes
ablaze
she
did
not
move
she
had
nerve
it
made
duane
thrill
he
saw
he
was
going
to
get
a
chance
waiting
had
been
a
science
with
him
but
here
it
was
hard
miss
ruth
had
fainted
and
that
was
well
miss
longstreth
had
fight
in
her
which
fact
helped
duane
yet
made
injury
possible
to
her
she
eluded
two
lunges
the
man
made
at
her
then
his
rough
hand
caught
her
waist
and
with
one
pull
ripped
it
asunder
exposing
her
beautiful
shoulder
white
as
snow
she
cried
out
the
prospect
of
being
robbed
or
even
killed
had
not
shaken
miss
longstreth
nerve
as
had
this
brutal
tearing
off
of
half
her
waist
the
ruffian
was
only
turned
partially
away
from
duane
for
himself
he
could
have
waited
no
longer
but
for
her
that
gun
was
still
held
dangerously
upward
close
to
her
duane
watched
only
that
then
a
bellow
made
him
jerk
his
head
colonel
longstreth
stood
in
the
doorway
in
a
magnificent
rage
he
had
no
weapon
strange
how
he
showed
no
fear
he
bellowed
something
again
duane
shifting
glance
caught
the
robber
sudden
movement
it
was
a
kind
of
start
he
seemed
stricken
duane
expected
him
to
shoot
longstreth
instead
the
hand
that
clutched
miss
longstreth
torn
waist
loosened
its
hold
the
other
hand
with
its
cocked
weapon
slowly
dropped
till
it
pointed
to
the
floor
that
was
duane
chance
swift
as
a
flash
he
drew
his
gun
and
fired
thud
went
his
bullet
and
he
could
not
tell
on
the
instant
whether
it
hit
the
robber
or
went
into
the
ceiling
then
the
robber
gun
boomed
harmlessly
he
fell
with
blood
spurting
over
his
face
duane
realized
he
had
hit
him
but
the
small
bullet
had
glanced
miss
longstreth
reeled
and
might
have
fallen
had
duane
not
supported
her
it
was
only
a
few
steps
to
a
couch
to
which
he
half
led
half
carried
her
then
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
across
the
patio
through
the
bar
to
the
yard
nevertheless
he
was
cautious
in
the
gloom
stood
a
saddled
horse
probably
the
one
belonging
to
the
fellow
he
had
shot
his
comrade
had
escaped
returning
to
the
duane
found
a
condition
approaching
pandemonium
the
innkeeper
rushed
in
pitchfork
in
hands
evidently
he
had
been
out
at
the
barn
he
was
now
shouting
to
find
out
what
had
happened
joel
the
was
trying
to
quiet
the
men
who
had
been
robbed
the
woman
wife
of
one
of
the
men
had
come
in
and
she
had
hysterics
the
girls
were
still
and
white
the
robber
bill
lay
where
he
had
fallen
and
duane
guessed
he
had
made
a
fair
shot
after
all
and
lastly
the
thing
that
struck
duane
most
of
all
was
longstreth
rage
he
never
saw
such
passion
like
a
caged
lion
longstreth
stalked
and
roared
there
came
a
quieter
moment
in
which
the
innkeeper
shrilly
protested
what
you
ravin
aboot
nobody
hurt
an
thet
lucky
i
swear
to
god
i
had
nothin
to
do
with
them
fellers
ought
to
kill
you
anyhow
replied
longstreth
and
his
voice
now
astounded
duane
it
was
so
full
of
power
upon
examination
duane
found
that
his
bullet
had
furrowed
the
temple
torn
a
great
piece
out
of
his
scalp
and
as
duane
had
guessed
had
glanced
he
was
not
seriously
injured
and
already
showed
signs
of
returning
consciousness
him
out
of
here
ordered
longstreth
and
he
turned
to
his
daughter
before
the
innkeeper
reached
the
robber
duane
had
secured
the
money
and
gun
taken
from
him
and
presently
recovered
the
property
of
the
other
men
joel
helped
the
innkeeper
carry
the
injured
man
somewhere
outside
miss
longstreth
was
sitting
white
but
composed
upon
the
couch
where
lay
miss
ruth
who
evidently
had
been
carried
there
by
the
colonel
duane
did
not
think
she
had
wholly
lost
consciousness
and
now
she
lay
very
still
with
eyes
dark
and
shadowy
her
face
pallid
and
wet
the
colonel
now
that
he
finally
remembered
his
seemed
to
be
gentle
and
kind
he
talked
soothingly
to
miss
ruth
made
light
of
the
adventure
said
she
must
learn
to
have
nerve
out
here
where
things
happened
i
be
of
any
service
asked
duane
solicitously
i
guess
there
nothing
you
can
do
talk
to
these
frightened
girls
while
i
go
see
what
to
be
done
with
that
robber
he
replied
and
telling
the
girls
that
there
was
no
more
danger
he
went
out
miss
longstreth
sat
with
one
hand
holding
her
torn
waist
in
place
the
other
she
extended
to
duane
he
took
it
awkwardly
and
he
felt
a
strange
thrill
saved
my
life
she
said
in
grave
sweet
seriousness
no
duane
exclaimed
might
have
struck
you
hurt
you
but
no
saw
murder
in
his
eyes
he
thought
i
had
jewels
under
my
dress
i
could
bear
his
touch
the
beast
i
have
fought
surely
my
life
was
in
you
kill
him
asked
miss
ruth
who
lay
listening
no
he
not
badly
very
glad
he
alive
said
miss
longstreth
shuddering
intention
was
bad
enough
duane
went
on
was
a
ticklish
place
for
me
you
see
he
was
half
drunk
and
i
was
afraid
his
gun
might
go
off
fool
careless
he
was
you
say
you
did
save
me
miss
longstreth
returned
quickly
let
it
go
at
that
duane
responded
saved
you
me
all
about
it
asked
miss
ruth
who
was
fast
recovering
rather
embarrassed
duane
briefly
told
the
incident
from
his
point
of
view
you
stood
there
all
the
time
with
your
hands
up
thinking
of
nothing
watching
for
nothing
except
a
little
moment
when
you
might
draw
your
gun
asked
miss
ruth
guess
that
about
it
he
replied
said
miss
longstreth
thoughtfully
was
fortunate
for
us
that
this
gentleman
happened
to
be
here
papa
scouts
laughs
at
danger
he
seemed
to
think
there
was
no
danger
yet
he
raved
after
it
with
us
all
the
way
to
fairdale
please
asked
miss
ruth
sweetly
offering
her
hand
am
ruth
herbert
and
this
is
my
cousin
ray
traveling
that
way
replied
duane
in
great
confusion
he
did
not
know
how
to
meet
the
situation
colonel
longstreth
returned
then
and
after
bidding
duane
a
good
night
which
seemed
rather
curt
by
contrast
to
the
graciousness
of
the
girls
he
led
them
away
before
going
to
bed
duane
went
outside
to
take
a
look
at
the
injured
robber
and
perhaps
to
ask
him
a
few
questions
to
duane
surprise
he
was
gone
and
so
was
his
horse
the
innkeeper
was
dumfounded
he
said
that
he
left
the
fellow
on
the
floor
in
the
he
come
to
inquired
duane
he
asked
for
he
say
anything
else
to
me
i
heard
him
talkin
to
the
father
of
them
mean
colonel
longstreth
reckon
he
sure
was
some
riled
was
he
jest
as
if
i
was
to
blame
fer
that
of
a
did
you
make
of
the
old
gent
rage
asked
duane
watching
the
innkeeper
he
scratched
his
head
dubiously
he
was
sincere
and
duane
believed
in
his
honesty
i
doggoned
if
i
know
what
to
make
of
it
but
i
reckon
either
crazy
or
got
more
nerve
than
most
nerve
maybe
duane
replied
me
a
bed
now
once
in
bed
in
the
dark
duane
composed
himself
to
think
over
the
several
events
of
the
evening
he
called
up
the
details
of
the
holdup
and
carefully
revolved
them
in
mind
the
colonel
wrath
under
circumstances
where
almost
any
texan
would
have
been
cool
nonplussed
duane
and
he
put
it
down
to
a
choleric
temperament
he
pondered
long
on
the
action
of
the
robber
when
longstreth
bellow
of
rage
burst
in
upon
him
this
ruffian
as
bold
and
mean
a
type
as
duane
had
ever
encountered
had
from
some
cause
or
other
been
startled
from
whatever
point
duane
viewed
the
man
strange
indecision
he
could
come
to
only
one
conclusion
his
start
his
check
his
fear
had
been
that
of
recognition
duane
compared
this
effect
with
the
suddenly
acquired
sense
he
had
gotten
of
colonel
longstreth
powerful
personality
why
had
that
desperate
robber
lowered
his
gun
and
stood
paralyzed
at
sight
and
sound
of
the
mayor
of
fairdale
this
was
not
answerable
there
might
have
been
a
number
of
reasons
all
to
colonel
longstreth
credit
but
duane
could
not
understand
longstreth
had
not
appeared
to
see
danger
for
his
daughter
even
though
she
had
been
roughly
handled
and
had
advanced
in
front
of
a
cocked
gun
duane
probed
deep
into
this
singular
fact
and
he
brought
to
bear
on
the
thing
all
his
knowledge
and
experience
of
violent
texas
life
and
he
found
that
the
instant
colonel
longstreth
had
appeared
on
the
scene
there
was
no
further
danger
threatening
his
daughter
why
that
likewise
duane
could
not
answer
then
his
rage
duane
concluded
had
been
solely
at
the
idea
of
his
daughter
being
assaulted
by
a
robber
this
deduction
was
indeed
a
but
duane
put
it
aside
to
crystallize
and
for
more
careful
consideration
next
morning
duane
found
that
the
little
town
was
called
sanderson
it
was
larger
than
he
had
at
first
supposed
he
walked
up
the
main
street
and
back
again
just
as
he
arrived
some
horsemen
rode
up
to
the
inn
and
dismounted
and
at
this
juncture
the
longstreth
party
came
out
duane
heard
colonel
longstreth
utter
an
exclamation
then
he
saw
him
shake
hands
with
a
tall
man
longstreth
looked
surprised
and
angry
and
he
spoke
with
force
but
duane
could
not
hear
what
it
was
he
said
the
fellow
laughed
yet
somehow
he
struck
duane
as
sullen
until
suddenly
he
espied
miss
longstreth
then
his
face
changed
and
he
removed
his
sombrero
duane
went
closer
did
you
come
with
the
teams
asked
longstreth
sharply
me
i
rode
a
horse
good
and
hard
was
the
reply
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
then
longstreth
turned
to
his
daughter
here
the
cousin
i
told
you
about
you
used
to
play
with
him
ten
years
ago
floyd
lawson
floyd
my
daughter
and
my
niece
ruth
duane
always
scrutinized
every
one
he
met
and
now
with
a
dangerous
game
to
play
with
a
consciousness
of
longstreth
unusual
and
significant
personality
he
bent
a
keen
and
searching
glance
upon
this
floyd
lawson
he
was
under
thirty
yet
gray
at
his
temples
dark
with
lines
left
by
wildness
dissipation
shadows
under
dark
eyes
a
mouth
strong
and
bitter
and
a
square
chin
a
reckless
careless
handsome
sinister
face
strangely
losing
the
hardness
when
he
smiled
the
grace
of
a
gentleman
clung
round
him
seemed
like
an
echo
in
his
mellow
voice
duane
doubted
not
that
he
like
many
a
young
man
had
drifted
out
to
the
frontier
where
rough
and
wild
life
had
wrought
sternly
but
had
not
quite
effaced
the
mark
of
good
family
colonel
longstreth
apparently
did
not
share
the
pleasure
of
his
daughter
and
his
niece
in
the
advent
of
this
cousin
something
hinged
on
this
meeting
duane
grew
intensely
curious
but
as
the
stage
appeared
ready
for
the
journey
he
had
no
further
opportunity
to
gratify
it
chapter
xvi
duane
followed
the
stage
through
the
town
out
into
the
open
on
to
a
wide
road
showing
years
of
travel
it
headed
northwest
to
the
left
rose
a
range
of
low
bleak
mountains
he
had
noted
yesterday
and
to
the
right
sloped
the
sweep
of
ridge
and
flat
the
driver
pushed
his
team
to
a
fast
trot
which
gait
surely
covered
ground
rapidly
the
stage
made
three
stops
in
the
forenoon
one
at
a
place
where
the
horses
could
be
watered
the
second
at
a
belonging
to
cowboys
who
were
riding
after
stock
and
the
third
at
a
small
cluster
of
adobe
and
stone
houses
constituting
a
hamlet
the
driver
called
longstreth
named
after
the
colonel
from
that
point
on
to
fairdale
there
were
only
a
few
ranches
each
one
controlling
great
acreage
early
in
the
afternoon
from
a
duane
sighted
fairdale
a
green
patch
in
the
mass
of
gray
for
the
barrens
of
texas
it
was
indeed
a
fair
sight
but
he
was
more
concerned
with
its
remoteness
from
civilization
than
its
beauty
at
that
time
in
the
early
seventies
when
the
vast
western
third
of
texas
was
a
wilderness
the
pioneer
had
done
wonders
to
settle
there
and
establish
places
like
fairdale
it
needed
only
a
glance
for
duane
to
pick
out
colonel
ranch
the
house
was
situated
on
the
only
elevation
around
fairdale
and
it
was
not
high
nor
more
than
a
few
minutes
walk
from
the
edge
of
the
town
it
was
a
low
structure
made
of
red
adobe
bricks
and
covered
what
appeared
to
be
fully
an
acre
of
ground
all
was
green
about
it
except
where
the
fenced
corrals
and
numerous
barns
or
sheds
showed
gray
and
red
duane
soon
reached
the
shady
outskirts
of
fairdale
and
entered
the
town
with
mingled
feelings
of
curiosity
eagerness
and
expectation
the
street
he
rode
down
was
a
main
one
and
on
both
sides
of
the
street
was
a
solid
row
of
saloons
resorts
hotels
saddled
horses
stood
hitched
all
along
the
sidewalk
in
two
long
lines
with
a
buckboard
and
team
here
and
there
breaking
the
continuity
this
block
was
busy
and
noisy
from
all
outside
appearances
fairdale
was
no
different
from
other
frontier
towns
and
duane
expectations
were
scarcely
realized
as
the
afternoon
was
waning
he
halted
at
a
little
inn
a
boy
took
charge
of
his
horse
duane
questioned
the
lad
about
fairdale
and
gradually
drew
to
the
subject
most
in
mind
longstreth
has
a
big
outfit
eh
he
has
replied
the
lad
know
how
many
cowboys
always
comin
and
goin
i
ai
acquainted
with
half
of
movement
of
stock
these
days
always
movin
he
replied
with
a
queer
look
but
he
did
not
follow
up
that
look
with
the
affirmative
duane
expected
place
i
hear
fairdale
is
so
lively
as
sanderson
but
it
i
heard
it
was
fellow
down
there
was
talking
about
two
cowboys
who
were
i
heered
all
about
that
joe
bean
an
brick
higgins
they
belong
heah
but
they
ai
heah
much
longstreth
duane
did
not
want
to
appear
so
he
turned
the
talk
into
other
channels
after
getting
supper
duane
strolled
up
and
down
the
main
street
when
darkness
set
in
he
went
into
a
hotel
bought
cigars
sat
around
and
watched
then
he
passed
out
and
went
into
the
next
place
this
was
of
rough
crude
exterior
but
the
inside
was
comparatively
pretentious
and
ablaze
with
lights
it
was
full
of
men
coming
and
going
a
crowd
that
smelled
of
horses
and
smoke
duane
sat
down
for
a
while
with
wide
eyes
and
open
ears
then
he
hunted
up
the
bar
where
most
of
the
guests
had
been
or
were
going
he
found
a
great
square
room
lighted
by
six
huge
lamps
a
bar
at
one
side
and
all
the
taken
up
by
tables
and
chairs
this
was
the
only
gambling
place
of
any
size
in
southern
texas
in
which
he
had
noted
the
absence
of
mexicans
there
was
some
going
on
at
this
moment
duane
stayed
in
there
for
a
while
and
knew
that
strangers
were
too
common
in
fairdale
to
be
conspicuous
then
he
returned
to
the
inn
where
he
had
engaged
a
room
duane
sat
down
on
the
steps
of
the
dingy
little
restaurant
two
men
were
conversing
inside
and
they
had
not
noticed
duane
what
the
stranger
name
asked
one
did
say
replied
the
other
was
a
strappin
big
man
struck
me
a
little
odd
he
did
no
cattleman
him
how
you
size
him
like
one
of
them
cool
easy
quiet
texans
who
been
lookin
for
a
man
for
years
to
kill
him
when
he
found
you
are
laramie
and
between
you
an
me
i
hope
he
for
long
sh
interrupted
laramie
must
be
half
drunk
to
go
that
thereafter
they
conversed
in
too
low
a
tone
for
duane
to
hear
and
presently
laramie
visitor
left
duane
went
inside
and
making
himself
agreeable
began
to
ask
casual
questions
about
fairdale
laramie
was
not
communicative
duane
went
to
his
room
in
a
thoughtful
frame
of
mind
had
visitor
meant
he
hoped
some
one
had
come
to
kill
longstreth
duane
inferred
just
that
from
the
interrupted
remark
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
mayor
of
fairdale
duane
felt
it
and
he
felt
also
if
there
was
a
crooked
and
dangerous
man
it
was
this
floyd
lawson
the
innkeeper
laramie
would
be
worth
cultivating
and
last
in
thoughts
that
night
was
miss
longstreth
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
her
how
strangely
the
meeting
with
her
had
affected
him
it
made
him
remember
that
time
when
girls
had
been
a
part
of
his
life
what
a
sad
and
dark
and
endless
void
lay
between
that
past
and
the
present
he
had
no
right
even
to
dream
of
a
beautiful
woman
like
ray
longstreth
that
conviction
however
did
not
dispel
her
indeed
it
seemed
perversely
to
make
her
grow
more
fascinating
duane
grew
conscious
of
a
strange
unaccountable
hunger
a
something
that
was
like
a
pang
in
his
breast
next
day
he
lounged
about
the
inn
he
did
not
make
any
overtures
to
the
taciturn
proprietor
duane
had
no
need
of
hurry
now
he
contented
himself
with
watching
and
listening
and
at
the
close
of
that
day
he
decided
fairdale
was
what
macnelly
had
claimed
it
to
be
and
that
he
was
on
the
track
of
an
unusual
adventure
the
following
day
he
spent
in
much
the
same
way
though
on
one
occasion
he
told
laramie
he
was
looking
for
a
man
the
innkeeper
grew
a
little
less
furtive
and
reticent
after
that
he
would
answer
casual
queries
and
it
did
not
take
duane
long
to
learn
that
laramie
had
seen
better
days
that
he
was
now
broken
bitter
and
hard
some
one
had
wronged
him
several
days
passed
duane
did
not
succeed
in
getting
any
closer
to
laramie
but
he
found
the
idlers
on
the
corners
and
in
front
of
the
stores
unsuspicious
and
willing
to
talk
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
find
out
that
fairdale
stood
parallel
with
huntsville
for
gambling
drinking
and
fighting
the
street
was
always
lined
with
dusty
saddled
horses
the
town
full
of
strangers
money
appeared
more
abundant
than
in
any
place
duane
had
ever
visited
and
it
was
spent
with
the
abandon
that
spoke
forcibly
of
easy
and
crooked
acquirement
duane
decided
that
sanderson
bradford
and
ord
were
but
notorious
outposts
to
this
fairdale
which
was
a
secret
center
of
rustlers
and
outlaws
and
what
struck
duane
strangest
of
all
was
the
fact
that
longstreth
was
mayor
here
and
held
court
daily
duane
knew
intuitively
before
a
chance
remark
gave
him
proof
that
this
court
was
a
sham
a
farce
and
he
wondered
if
it
were
not
a
blind
this
wonder
of
his
was
equivalent
to
suspicion
of
colonel
longstreth
and
duane
reproached
himself
then
he
realized
that
the
reproach
was
because
of
the
daughter
inquiry
had
brought
him
the
fact
that
ray
longstreth
had
just
come
to
live
with
her
father
longstreth
had
originally
been
a
planter
in
louisiana
where
his
family
had
remained
after
his
advent
in
the
west
he
was
a
rich
rancher
he
owned
half
of
fairdale
he
was
a
on
a
large
scale
floyd
lawson
was
his
lieutenant
and
associate
in
deals
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fifth
day
of
duane
stay
in
fairdale
he
returned
to
the
inn
from
his
usual
stroll
and
upon
entering
was
amazed
to
have
a
young
fellow
rush
by
him
out
of
the
door
inside
laramie
was
lying
on
the
floor
with
a
bloody
bruise
on
his
face
he
did
not
appear
to
be
dangerously
hurt
snecker
he
hit
me
and
went
after
the
said
laramie
laboring
to
his
feet
you
hurt
much
queried
duane
guess
not
but
bo
need
to
have
soaked
me
i
been
robbed
before
without
i
take
a
look
after
bo
replied
duane
he
went
out
and
glanced
down
the
street
toward
the
center
of
the
town
he
did
not
see
any
one
he
could
take
for
the
innkeeper
assailant
then
he
looked
up
the
street
and
he
saw
the
young
fellow
about
a
block
away
hurrying
along
and
gazing
back
duane
yelled
for
him
to
stop
and
started
to
go
after
him
snecker
broke
into
a
run
then
duane
set
out
to
overhaul
him
there
were
two
motives
in
duane
action
one
of
anger
and
the
other
a
desire
to
make
a
friend
of
this
man
laramie
whom
duane
believed
could
tell
him
much
duane
was
light
on
his
feet
and
he
had
a
giant
stride
he
gained
rapidly
upon
snecker
who
turning
this
way
and
that
could
not
get
out
of
sight
then
he
took
to
the
open
country
and
ran
straight
for
the
green
hill
where
longstreth
house
stood
duane
had
almost
caught
snecker
when
he
reached
the
shrubbery
and
trees
and
there
eluded
him
but
duane
kept
him
in
sight
in
the
shade
on
the
paths
and
up
the
road
into
the
courtyard
and
he
saw
snecker
go
straight
for
house
duane
was
not
to
be
turned
back
by
that
singular
as
it
was
he
did
not
stop
to
consider
it
seemed
enough
to
know
that
fate
had
directed
him
to
the
path
of
this
rancher
longstreth
duane
entered
the
first
open
door
on
that
side
of
the
court
it
opened
into
a
corridor
which
led
into
a
plaza
it
had
wide
smooth
stone
porches
and
flowers
and
shrubbery
in
the
center
duane
hurried
through
to
burst
into
the
presence
of
miss
longstreth
and
a
number
of
young
people
evidently
she
was
giving
a
little
party
lawson
stood
leaning
against
one
of
the
pillars
that
supported
the
porch
roof
at
sight
of
duane
his
face
changed
remarkably
expressing
amazement
consternation
then
fear
in
the
quick
ensuing
silence
miss
longstreth
rose
white
as
her
dress
the
young
women
present
stared
in
astonishment
if
they
were
not
equally
perturbed
there
were
cowboys
present
who
suddenly
grew
intent
and
still
by
these
things
duane
gathered
that
his
appearance
must
be
disconcerting
he
was
panting
he
wore
no
hat
or
coat
his
big
showed
plainly
at
his
hip
sight
of
miss
longstreth
had
an
unaccountable
effect
upon
duane
he
was
plunged
into
confusion
for
the
moment
he
saw
no
one
but
her
longstreth
i
came
to
search
your
house
panted
duane
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
saying
yet
the
instant
he
spoke
he
realized
that
that
should
have
been
the
last
thing
for
him
to
say
he
had
blundered
but
he
was
not
used
to
women
and
this
girl
made
him
thrill
and
his
heart
beat
thickly
and
his
wits
go
scattering
my
house
exclaimed
miss
longstreth
and
red
succeeded
the
white
in
her
cheeks
she
appeared
astonished
and
angry
for
why
how
dare
you
this
is
unwarrantable
man
bo
snecker
assaulted
and
robbed
jim
laramie
replied
duane
hurriedly
chased
snecker
here
saw
him
run
into
the
oh
sir
you
must
be
mistaken
we
have
seen
no
one
in
the
absence
of
my
father
i
mistress
here
i
not
permit
you
to
lawson
appeared
to
come
out
of
his
astonishment
he
stepped
forward
do
be
bothered
now
he
said
to
his
cousin
making
a
bluff
i
settle
him
see
here
mister
you
clear
out
want
snecker
he
here
and
i
going
to
get
him
replied
duane
quietly
that
all
a
bluff
sneered
lawson
on
to
your
game
you
just
wanted
an
excuse
to
break
in
here
to
see
my
cousin
again
when
you
saw
the
company
you
invented
that
excuse
now
be
off
or
it
be
the
worse
for
duane
felt
his
face
burn
with
a
tide
of
hot
blood
almost
he
felt
that
he
was
guilty
of
such
motive
had
he
not
been
unable
to
put
this
ray
longstreth
out
of
his
mind
there
seemed
to
be
scorn
in
her
eyes
now
and
somehow
that
checked
his
embarrassment
longstreth
will
you
let
me
search
the
house
he
asked
i
regret
to
say
i
do
so
without
your
not
dare
she
flashed
she
stood
erect
her
bosom
swelling
me
yes
i
are
you
she
demanded
suddenly
a
texas
ranger
replied
duane
texas
ranger
she
echoed
floyd
lawson
dark
face
turned
pale
longstreth
i
do
need
warrants
to
search
houses
said
duane
sorry
to
annoy
you
i
prefer
to
have
your
permission
a
ruffian
has
taken
refuge
here
in
your
father
house
he
hidden
somewhere
may
i
look
for
him
you
are
indeed
a
duane
produced
his
papers
miss
longstreth
haughtily
refused
to
look
at
them
longstreth
i
come
to
make
fairdale
a
safer
cleaner
better
place
for
women
and
children
i
do
wonder
at
your
resentment
but
to
doubt
me
insult
me
some
day
you
may
be
floyd
lawson
made
a
violent
motion
with
his
hands
stuff
cousin
go
on
with
your
party
i
take
a
couple
of
cowboys
and
go
with
this
this
texas
said
duane
coolly
as
he
eyed
lawson
you
be
able
to
find
snecker
quicker
than
i
do
you
mean
demanded
lawson
and
now
he
grew
livid
evidently
he
was
a
man
of
fierce
quick
passions
quarrel
said
miss
longstreth
you
go
with
him
please
hurry
i
be
nervous
till
the
man
found
or
you
sure
there
not
they
started
with
several
cowboys
to
search
the
house
they
went
through
the
rooms
searching
calling
out
peering
into
dark
places
it
struck
duane
more
than
forcibly
that
lawson
did
all
the
calling
he
was
hurried
too
tried
to
keep
in
the
lead
duane
wondered
if
he
knew
his
voice
would
be
recognized
by
the
hiding
man
be
that
as
it
might
it
was
duane
who
peered
into
a
dark
corner
and
then
with
a
gun
leveled
said
out
he
came
forth
into
the
flare
a
tall
slim
youth
wearing
sombrero
blouse
and
trousers
duane
collared
him
before
any
of
the
others
could
move
and
held
the
gun
close
enough
to
make
him
shrink
but
he
did
not
impress
duane
as
being
frightened
just
then
nevertheless
he
had
a
clammy
face
the
pallid
look
of
a
man
who
had
just
gotten
over
a
shock
he
peered
into
duane
face
then
into
that
of
the
cowboy
next
to
him
then
into
lawson
and
if
ever
in
duane
life
he
beheld
relief
it
was
then
that
was
all
duane
needed
to
know
but
he
meant
to
find
out
more
if
he
could
you
asked
duane
quietly
snecker
he
said
you
hide
here
for
he
appeared
to
grow
sullen
i
be
as
safe
in
longstreth
as
what
you
do
with
him
lawson
queried
as
if
uncertain
now
the
capture
was
made
see
to
that
replied
duane
and
he
pushed
snecker
in
front
of
him
out
into
the
court
duane
had
suddenly
conceived
the
idea
of
taking
snecker
before
mayor
longstreth
in
the
court
when
duane
arrived
at
the
hall
where
court
was
held
there
were
other
men
there
a
dozen
or
more
and
all
seemed
excited
evidently
news
of
duane
had
preceded
him
longstreth
sat
at
a
table
up
on
a
platform
near
him
sat
a
grizzled
man
with
deep
eyes
and
this
was
hanford
owens
county
judge
to
the
right
stood
a
tall
angular
fellow
with
a
drooping
sandy
mustache
conspicuous
on
his
vest
was
a
huge
silver
shield
this
was
gorsech
one
of
longstreth
sheriffs
there
were
four
other
men
whom
duane
knew
by
sight
several
whose
faces
were
familiar
and
half
a
dozen
strangers
all
dusty
horsemen
longstreth
pounded
hard
on
the
table
to
be
heard
mayor
or
not
he
was
unable
at
once
to
quell
the
excitement
gradually
however
it
subsided
and
from
the
last
few
utterances
before
quiet
was
restored
duane
gathered
that
he
had
intruded
upon
some
kind
of
a
meeting
in
the
hall
you
break
in
here
for
demanded
longstreth
this
the
court
are
you
the
mayor
of
fairdale
interrogated
duane
his
voice
was
clear
and
loud
almost
piercing
replied
longstreth
like
flint
he
seemed
yet
duane
felt
his
intense
interest
arrested
a
criminal
said
duane
a
criminal
ejaculated
longstreth
who
you
a
ranger
replied
duane
a
significant
silence
ensued
charge
snecker
with
assault
on
laramie
and
attempted
robbery
if
not
murder
he
had
a
shady
past
here
as
this
court
will
know
if
it
keeps
a
this
i
hear
about
you
bo
get
up
and
speak
for
yourself
said
longstreth
gruffly
snecker
got
up
not
without
a
furtive
glance
at
duane
and
he
had
shuffled
forward
a
few
steps
toward
the
mayor
he
had
an
evil
front
but
not
the
boldness
even
of
a
rustler
ai
so
longstreth
he
began
loudly
went
in
laramie
place
fer
grub
some
feller
i
never
seen
before
come
in
from
the
hall
an
hit
laramie
an
wrestled
him
on
the
floor
i
went
out
then
this
big
ranger
chased
me
an
fetched
me
here
i
did
do
nothin
this
hankerin
to
arrest
somebody
thet
my
hunch
longstreth
said
something
in
an
undertone
to
judge
owens
and
that
worthy
nodded
his
great
bushy
head
you
discharged
said
longstreth
bluntly
the
rest
of
you
clear
out
of
he
absolutely
ignored
the
ranger
that
was
his
rebuff
to
duane
his
slap
in
the
face
to
an
interfering
ranger
service
if
longstreth
was
crooked
he
certainly
had
magnificent
nerve
duane
almost
decided
he
was
above
suspicion
but
his
nonchalance
his
air
of
finality
his
authoritative
assurance
these
to
duane
keen
and
practiced
eyes
were
in
significant
contrast
to
a
certain
tenseness
of
line
about
his
mouth
and
a
slow
paling
of
his
olive
skin
in
that
momentary
lull
duane
scrutiny
of
longstreth
gathered
an
impression
of
the
man
intense
curiosity
then
the
prisoner
snecker
with
a
cough
that
broke
the
spell
of
silence
shuffled
a
couple
of
steps
toward
the
door
on
called
duane
the
call
halted
snecker
as
if
it
had
been
a
bullet
i
saw
snecker
attack
laramie
said
duane
his
voice
still
ringing
has
the
court
to
say
to
that
court
has
this
to
say
west
of
the
pecos
we
not
aid
any
ranger
service
we
do
want
you
out
here
fairdale
does
need
a
lie
longstreth
retorted
duane
letters
from
fairdale
citizens
all
begging
for
ranger
longstreth
turned
white
the
veins
corded
at
his
temples
he
appeared
about
to
burst
into
rage
he
was
at
a
loss
for
quick
reply
floyd
lawson
rushed
in
and
up
to
the
table
the
blood
showed
black
and
thick
in
his
face
his
utterance
was
incoherent
his
uncontrollable
outbreak
of
temper
seemed
out
of
all
proportion
to
any
cause
he
should
reasonably
have
had
for
anger
longstreth
shoved
him
back
with
a
curse
and
a
warning
glare
your
warrant
to
arrest
snecker
shouted
longstreth
do
need
warrants
to
make
arrests
longstreth
you
ignorant
of
the
power
of
texas
come
none
of
your
damned
ranger
stunts
out
here
i
block
that
passionate
reply
of
longstreth
was
the
signal
duane
had
been
waiting
for
he
had
helped
on
the
crisis
he
wanted
to
force
longstreth
hand
and
show
the
town
his
stand
duane
backed
clear
of
everybody
i
call
on
you
all
cried
duane
piercingly
call
on
you
to
witness
the
arrest
of
a
criminal

of
fairdale

will
be
recorded

report

white
with
working
jaw
you
shown
your
hand
said
duane
in
a
voice
that
carried
far
and
held
those
who
heard
honest
citizen
of
fairdale
can
now
see
what
plain
yours
is
a
damn
poor
hand
you
going
to
hear
me
call
a
spade
a
spade
in
the
two
years
you
been
mayor
you
never
arrested
one
rustler
strange
when
fairdale
a
nest
for
rustlers
you
never
sent
a
prisoner
to
del
rio
let
alone
to
austin
you
have
no
jail
there
have
been
nine
murders
during
your
office
innumerable
and
holdups
not
one
arrest
but
you
have
ordered
arrests
for
trivial
offenses
and
have
punished
these
out
of
all
proportion
there
have
been
lawsuits
in
your
over
cattle
deals
property
lines
strange
how
in
these
lawsuits
you
or
lawson
or
other
men
close
to
you
were
always
involved
strange
how
it
seems
the
law
was
stretched
to
favor
your
interest
duane
paused
in
his
cold
ringing
speech
in
the
silence
both
outside
and
inside
the
hall
could
be
heard
the
deep
breathing
of
agitated
men
longstreth
was
indeed
a
study
yet
did
he
betray
anything
but
rage
at
this
interloper
here
plain
talk
for
you
and
fairdale
went
on
duane
do
accuse
you
and
your
court
of
dishonesty
i
say
strange
law
here
has
been
a
farce
the
motive
behind
all
this
laxity
is
plain
to
me
yet
but
i
call
your
hand
chapter
xvii
duane
left
the
hall
elbowed
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
went
down
the
street
he
was
certain
that
on
the
faces
of
some
men
he
had
seen
wonder
and
satisfaction
he
had
struck
some
kind
of
a
hot
trait
and
he
meant
to
see
where
it
led
it
was
by
no
means
unlikely
that
cheseldine
might
be
at
the
other
end
duane
controlled
a
mounting
eagerness
but
ever
and
anon
it
was
shot
through
with
a
remembrance
of
ray
longstreth
he
suspected
her
father
of
being
not
what
he
pretended
he
might
very
probably
would
bring
sorrow
and
shame
to
this
young
woman
the
thought
made
him
smart
with
pain
she
began
to
haunt
him
and
then
he
was
thinking
more
of
her
beauty
and
sweetness
than
of
the
disgrace
he
might
bring
upon
her
some
strange
emotion
long
locked
inside
duane
heart
knocked
to
be
heard
to
be
let
out
he
was
troubled
upon
returning
to
the
inn
he
found
laramie
there
apparently
none
the
worse
for
his
injury
are
you
laramie
he
asked
i
feelin
as
well
as
could
be
expected
replied
laramie
his
head
was
circled
by
a
bandage
that
did
not
conceal
the
lump
where
he
had
been
struck
he
looked
pale
but
was
bright
enough
was
a
good
crack
snecker
gave
you
remarked
duane
ai
accusin
bo
remonstrated
laramie
with
eyes
that
made
duane
thoughtful
i
accuse
him
i
caught
him
took
him
to
longstreth
court
but
they
let
him
laramie
appeared
to
be
agitated
by
this
intimation
of
friendship
here
laramie
went
on
duane
some
parts
of
texas
it
policy
to
be
policy
and
between
ourselves
i
want
you
to
know
i
lean
on
your
side
of
the
laramie
gave
a
quick
start
presently
duane
turned
and
frankly
met
his
gaze
he
had
startled
laramie
out
of
his
habitual
set
taciturnity
but
even
as
he
looked
the
light
that
might
have
been
amaze
and
joy
faded
out
of
his
face
leaving
it
the
same
old
mask
still
duane
had
seen
enough
like
a
bloodhound
he
had
a
scent
about
work
laramie
who
you
say
snecker
worked
for
did
say
so
now
ca
you
laramie
you
powerful
peevish
it
that
bump
on
your
head
who
does
snecker
work
for
he
works
at
all
which
sure
ai
often
he
rides
for
seems
to
me
that
longstreth
the
whole
circus
round
fairdale
i
was
some
sore
the
other
day
to
find
i
was
losing
good
money
at
longstreth
faro
game
sure
if
i
won
i
would
have
been
sore
ha
ha
but
i
was
surprised
to
hear
some
one
say
longstreth
owned
the
hope
so
owns
considerable
property
hereabouts
replied
laramie
constrainedly
again
laramie
like
every
other
fellow
i
meet
in
this
town
you
afraid
to
open
your
trap
about
longstreth
get
me
straight
laramie
i
do
care
a
damn
for
colonel
mayor
longstreth
and
for
cause
i
throw
a
gun
on
him
just
as
quick
as
on
any
rustler
in
cheap
replied
laramie
making
light
of
his
bluster
but
the
red
was
deeper
in
his
face
i
know
that
duane
said
usually
i
do
talk
then
not
well
known
that
longstreth
owns
the
hope
so
it
known
in
pecos
all
right
but
longstreth
name
connected
with
the
hope
so
blandy
runs
the
blandy
his
faro
game
crooked
or
i
a
locoed
bronch
not
that
we
do
have
lots
of
crooked
a
fellow
can
stand
for
them
but
blandy
mean
never
looks
you
in
the
eyes
that
hope
so
place
ought
to
be
run
by
a
good
fellow
like
you
replied
he
and
duane
imagined
his
voice
a
little
husky
you
hear
i
used
to
run
it
did
you
duane
said
quickly
reckon
i
built
the
place
made
additions
twice
owned
it
for
eleven
i
be
it
was
indeed
duane
turn
to
be
surprised
and
with
the
surprise
came
a
glimmering
sorry
you
not
there
now
did
you
sell
out
just
lost
the
laramie
was
bursting
for
relief
now
to
talk
to
tell
sympathy
had
made
him
soft
was
two
years
years
last
march
he
went
on
was
in
a
big
cattle
deal
with
longstreth
we
got
the
stock
an
my
share
eighteen
hundred
head
was
rustled
off
i
owed
longstreth
he
pressed
me
it
come
to
a
lawsuit
an
i
was
it
hurt
duane
to
look
at
laramie
he
was
white
and
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
duane
saw
the
bitterness
the
defeat
the
agony
of
the
man
he
had
failed
to
meet
his
obligations
nevertheless
he
had
been
swindled
all
that
he
suppressed
all
that
would
have
been
passion
had
the
man
spirit
not
been
broken
lay
bare
for
duane
to
see
he
had
now
the
secret
of
his
bitterness
but
the
reason
he
did
not
openly
accuse
longstreth
the
secret
of
his
reticence
and
fear
these
duane
thought
best
to
try
to
learn
at
some
later
time
luck
it
certainly
was
tough
duane
said
you
a
good
loser
and
the
wheel
turns
now
laramie
here
what
i
need
your
advice
i
got
a
little
money
but
before
i
lose
it
i
want
to
invest
some
buy
some
stock
or
buy
an
interest
in
some
rancher
herd
what
i
want
you
to
steer
me
on
is
a
good
square
rancher
or
maybe
a
couple
of
ranchers
if
there
happen
to
be
two
honest
ones
ha
ha
no
deals
with
ranchers
who
ride
in
the
dark
with
rustlers
i
a
hunch
fairdale
is
full
of
them
now
laramie
you
been
here
for
years
sure
you
must
know
a
couple
of
men
above
god
i
do
he
replied
feelingly
morton
an
si
zimmer
my
friends
an
neighbors
all
my
prosperous
days
an
friends
still
you
can
gamble
on
frank
and
si
but
if
you
want
advice
from
me
do
invest
money
in
stock
any
new
feller
buyin
stock
these
days
will
be
rustled
quicker
he
can
say
jack
robinson
the
pioneers
the
new
cattlemen
these
are
easy
pickin
for
the
rustlers
lord
knows
all
the
ranchers
are
easy
enough
pickin
but
the
new
fellers
have
to
learn
the
ropes
they
know
anythin
or
anybody
an
the
old
ranchers
are
wise
an
sore
fight
if
they
duane
put
in
as
he
paused
they
knew
who
was
rustling
the
stock
they
had
the
nerve
thet
so
then
what
make
them
fight
leader
thar
jim
boomed
a
big
voice
a
man
of
great
bulk
with
a
ruddy
merry
face
entered
the
room
morton
replied
laramie
introduce
you
to
my
guest
here
but
i
do
know
his
haw
thet
all
right
few
men
out
hyar
go
by
their
right
morton
put
in
duane
gave
me
a
hunch
you
be
a
good
man
to
tie
to
now
i
a
little
money
and
before
i
lose
it
i
like
to
invest
it
in
morton
smiled
broadly
on
the
square
duane
said
bluntly
you
fellows
never
size
up
your
neighbors
any
better
than
you
have
sized
me
well
you
wo
get
any
it
was
enjoyment
for
duane
to
make
his
remarks
to
these
men
pregnant
with
meaning
morton
showed
his
pleasure
his
interest
but
his
faith
held
aloof
got
some
money
will
you
let
me
in
on
some
kind
of
deal
will
you
start
me
up
as
a
stockman
with
a
little
herd
all
my
own
stranger
to
come
out
you
be
foolish
to
buy
cattle
now
i
do
want
to
take
your
money
an
see
you
lose
out
better
go
back
across
the
pecos
where
the
rustlers
ai
so
strong
i
have
had
more
hundred
herd
of
stock
for
ten
years
the
rustlers
let
me
hang
on
to
a
breedin
herd
kind
of
them
ai
it
of
kind
all
i
hear
is
rustlers
morton
replied
duane
with
impatience
see
i
have
ever
lived
long
in
a
county
who
heads
the
gang
anyway
morton
looked
at
duane
with
a
curiously
amused
smile
then
snapped
his
big
jaw
as
if
to
shut
in
impulsive
words
here
morton
it
stands
to
reason
no
matter
how
strong
these
rustlers
are
how
hidden
their
work
however
involved
with
supposedly
honest
men
they
ca
come
with
the
pioneers
an
they
last
till
thar
a
single
steer
left
he
declared
if
you
take
that
view
of
circumstances
i
just
figure
you
as
one
of
the
morton
looked
as
if
he
were
about
to
brain
duane
with
the
butt
of
his
whip
his
anger
flashed
by
then
evidently
as
unworthy
of
him
and
something
striking
him
as
funny
he
boomed
out
a
laugh
not
so
funny
duane
went
on
you
going
to
pretend
a
yellow
streak
what
else
will
i
think
he
repeated
i
know
men
of
nerve
and
here
they
not
any
different
from
those
in
other
places
i
say
if
you
show
anything
like
a
lack
of
sand
it
all
bluff
by
nature
you
got
nerve
there
are
a
lot
of
men
around
fairdale
who
afraid
of
their
shadows
afraid
to
be
out
after
dark
afraid
to
open
their
mouths
but
you
not
one
so
i
say
if
you
claim
these
rustlers
will
last
you
pretending
lack
of
nerve
just
to
help
the
popular
idea
along
for
they
ca
last
what
you
need
out
here
is
some
new
blood
savvy
what
i
mean
i
reckon
i
do
he
replied
looking
as
if
a
storm
had
blown
over
him
i
look
you
up
the
next
time
i
come
to
then
he
went
out
laramie
had
eyes
like
flint
striking
fire
he
breathed
a
deep
breath
and
looked
around
the
room
before
his
gaze
fixed
again
on
duane
he
replied
speaking
low
picked
the
right
men
now
who
in
the
hell
are
you
reaching
into
the
inside
pocket
of
his
buckskin
vest
duane
turned
the
lining
out
a
bright
silver
object
flashed
as
he
shoved
it
pocket
and
all
under
jim
hard
eyes
he
whispered
cracking
the
table
with
his
fist
sure
rung
true
to
do
you
know
who
boss
of
this
secret
gang
of
rustlers
hereabouts
asked
duane
bluntly
it
was
characteristic
of
him
to
come
sharp
to
the
point
his
voice
something
deep
easy
cool
about
him
seemed
to
steady
laramie
replied
laramie
anybody
know
went
on
duane
i
reckon
there
not
one
honest
native
who
you
have
your
suspicions
me
your
idea
about
this
crowd
that
hangs
round
the
saloons
the
a
bad
lot
replied
laramie
with
the
quick
assurance
of
knowledge
of
them
have
been
here
years
others
have
drifted
in
some
of
them
work
odd
times
they
rustle
a
few
steers
steal
rob
anythin
for
a
little
money
to
drink
an
gamble
jest
a
bad
lot
you
any
idea
whether
cheseldine
and
his
gang
are
associated
with
this
gang
here
knows
i
always
suspected
them
the
same
gang
none
of
us
ever
seen
cheseldine
an
thet
strange
when
knell
poggin
panhandle
smith
blossom
kane
and
fletcher
they
all
ride
here
often
no
poggin
does
come
often
but
the
others
do
for
thet
matter
they
around
all
over
west
of
the
i
puzzled
over
this
said
duane
do
men
apparently
honest
men
seem
to
be
so
here
is
that
a
fact
or
only
my
impression
a
sure
fact
replied
laramie
darkly
have
lost
cattle
property
in
fairdale
lost
them
honestly
or
otherwise
as
has
been
proved
an
in
some
cases
when
they
talked
hinted
a
little
they
was
found
dead
apparently
held
up
an
robbed
but
dead
dead
men
do
talk
thet
why
we
close
duane
felt
a
dark
somber
sternness
rustling
cattle
was
not
intolerable
western
texas
had
gone
on
prospering
growing
in
spite
of
the
hordes
of
rustlers
ranging
its
vast
stretches
but
a
cold
secret
murderous
hold
on
a
little
struggling
community
was
something
too
strange
too
terrible
for
men
to
stand
long
the
ranger
was
about
to
speak
again
when
the
clatter
of
hoofs
interrupted
him
horses
halted
out
in
front
and
one
rider
got
down
floyd
lawson
entered
he
called
for
tobacco
if
his
visit
surprised
laramie
he
did
not
show
any
evidence
but
lawson
showed
rage
as
he
saw
the
ranger
and
then
a
dark
glint
flitted
from
the
eyes
that
shifted
from
duane
to
laramie
and
back
again
duane
leaned
easily
against
the
counter
that
was
a
bad
break
of
yours
lawson
said
you
come
fooling
round
the
ranch
again
there
be
it
seemed
strange
that
a
man
who
had
lived
west
of
the
pecos
for
ten
years
could
not
see
in
duane
something
which
forbade
that
kind
of
talk
it
certainly
was
not
nerve
lawson
showed
men
of
courage
were
seldom
intolerant
with
the
matchless
nerve
that
characterized
the
great
gunmen
of
the
day
there
was
a
cool
unobtrusive
manner
a
speech
brief
almost
gentle
certainly
courteous
lawson
was
a
louisianian
of
french
extraction
a
man
evidently
who
had
never
been
crossed
in
anything
and
who
was
strong
brutal
passionate
which
qualities
in
the
face
of
a
situation
like
this
made
him
simply
a
fool
saying
again
you
used
your
ranger
bluff
just
to
get
near
ray
longstreth
lawson
sneered
you
if
you
come
up
there
again
there
be
right
but
not
the
kind
you
think
duane
retorted
his
voice
sharp
and
cold
longstreth
would
stoop
to
know
a
dirty
like
you
said
lawson
hotly
he
did
not
seem
to
have
a
deliberate
intention
to
rouse
duane
the
man
was
simply
rancorous
jealous
call
you
right
you
cheap
bluffer
you
you
damned
interfering
conceited
ranger
i
not
take
offense
because
you
seem
to
be
championing
your
beautiful
cousin
replied
duane
in
slow
speech
let
me
return
your
compliment
you
a
fine
southerner
why
you
only
a
cheap
damned
rustler
duane
hissed
the
last
word
then
for
him
there
was
the
truth
in
working
face
lawson
jerked
moved
meant
to
draw
but
how
slow
duane
lunged
forward
his
long
arm
swept
up
and
lawson
staggered
backward
knocking
table
and
chairs
to
fall
hard
in
a
posture
against
the
wall
draw
warned
duane
git
away
from
your
gun
yelled
laramie
but
lawson
was
crazed
with
fury
he
tugged
at
his
hip
his
face
corded
with
purple
welts
malignant
murderous
duane
kicked
the
gun
out
of
his
hand
lawson
got
up
raging
and
rushed
out
laramie
lifted
his
shaking
hands
you
wing
him
for
he
wailed
was
drawin
on
you
men
like
him
wo
do
out
fool
will
roar
and
butt
himself
with
all
his
gang
right
into
our
hands
he
just
the
man
i
needed
to
meet
besides
shooting
him
would
have
been
exclaimed
laramie
for
me
replied
duane
may
be
true
whoever
you
are
but

always
been
after

now
here

him

hot
together
you
approach
four
or
five
men
you
know
well
and
can
absolutely
trust
i
may

duane
went
from
place
to
place
corner
to
corner
bar
to
bar
watching
listening
recording
the
excitement
had
preceded
him
and
speculation
was
rife
he
thought
best
to
keep
out
of
it
after
dark
he
stole
up
to
longstreth
ranch
the
evening
was
warm
the
doors
were
open
and
in
the
twilight
the
only
lamps
that
had
been
lit
were
in
longstreth
big
at
the
far
end
of
the
house
when
a
buckboard
drove
up
and
longstreth
and
lawson
alighted
duane
was
well
hidden
in
the
bushes
so
well
screened
that
he
could
get
but
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
longstreth
as
he
went
in
for
all
duane
could
see
he
appeared
to
be
a
calm
and
quiet
man
intense
beneath
the
surface
with
an
air
of
dignity
under
insult
duane
chance
to
observe
lawson
was
lost
they
went
into
the
house
without
speaking
and
closed
the
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
porch
close
under
a
window
was
an
offset
between
step
and
wall
and
there
in
the
shadow
duane
hid
so
duane
waited
there
in
the
darkness
with
patience
born
of
many
hours
of
hiding
presently
a
lamp
was
lit
and
duane
heard
the
swish
of
skirts
happened
surely
ruth
he
heard
miss
longstreth
say
anxiously
just
met
me
in
the
hall
and
did
speak
he
seemed
pale
floyd
looked
like

once
he
did
try
to

something

this
had
been

what

emphatically
run
after
any

to

laughed
ray

replied
ruth
stubbornly
so
he
mushy
and
when
he
been
drinking
and
tries
to
kiss
me
i
hate
him
there
were
steps
on
the
hall
floor
girls
sounded
out
lawson
voice
minus
its
usual
gaiety
what
the
matter
asked
ray
presently
never
saw
papa
as
he
is
nor
you
so
so
worried
tell
me
what
has
happened
ray
we
had
a
jar
replied
lawson
with
a
blunt
expressive
laugh
echoed
both
the
girls
curiously
had
to
submit
to
a
damnable
outrage
added
lawson
passionately
as
if
the
sound
of
his
voice
augmented
his
feeling

about

cleared
his
throat
in

way
that
betrayed

duane
sunk
deeper
into
the
shadow
of
his
covert
and
stiffening
his
muscles
for
a
protected
spell
of
rigidity
prepared
to
listen
with
all
acuteness
and
intensity
just
one
word
from
this
lawson
inadvertently
uttered
in
a
moment
of
passion
might
be
the
word
duane
needed
for
his

at

began
lawson
rapidly
father
and
judge
owens
and
i
were
there
in
consultation
with
three
ranchers
from
out
of
town
then
that
damned
ranger
stalked
in
dragging
snecker
the
fellow
who
hid
here
in
the
house
he
had
arrested
snecker
for
alleged
assault
on
a
named
laramie
snecker
being
obviously
innocent
he
was
discharged
then
this
ranger
began
shouting
his
insults
law
was
a
farce
in
fairdale
the
court
was
a
farce
there
was
no
law
your
father
office
as
mayor
should
be
impeached
he
made
arrests
only
for
petty
offenses
he
was
afraid
of
the
rustlers
highwaymen
murderers
he
was
afraid
or
he
just
let
them
alone
he
used
his
office
to
cheat
ranchers
and
cattlemen
in
lawsuits
all
this
the
ranger
yelled
for
every
one
to
hear
a
damnable
outrage
your
father
ray
insulted
in
his
own
court
by
a
rowdy
ranger
cried
ray

in
mingled
distress
and
anger

are
all
a
low
set
many
of
them
worse
than
the
outlaws
they
hunt
some
of
them
were
outlaws
and
before
they
became
rangers
this
is
one
of
the
worst
of
the

he
keen

that
makes
him
more
to

for
he
is
to

he
wanted

cried
ray
longstreth
passionately
see
ray
this
fellow
like
all
rangers
seeks
notoriety
he
made
that
play
with
snecker
just
for
a
chance
to
rant
against
your
father
he
tried
to
inflame
all
fairdale
against
him
that
about

strangers
rode
into
fairdale
and
other
customers
new
to
duane
if
not
to
fairdale
helped
to
create
a
charged
and
waiting
atmosphere
the
saloons
did
unusual
business
and
were
never
closed
respectable
citizens
of
the
town
were
awakened
in
the
early
dawn
by
rowdies
carousing
in
the
streets
duane
kept
pretty
close
under
cover
during
the
day
he
did
not
entertain
the
opinion
that
the
first
time
he
walked
he
would
be
a
target
for
guns
things
seldom
happened
that
way
and
when
they
did
happen
so
it
was
more
accident
than
design
but
at
night
he
was
not
idle
he
met
laramie
morton
zimmer
and
others
of
like
character
a
secret
club
had
been
formed
and
all
the
members
were
ready
for
action
duane
spent
hours
at
night
watching
the
house
where
floyd
lawson
stayed
when
he
was
not
up
at
longstreth
at
night
he
was
visited
or
at
least
the
house
was
by
strange
men
who
were
swift
stealthy
mysterious
all
that
kindly
disposed
friends
or
neighbors
would
not
have
been
duane
had
not
been
able
to
recognize
any
of
these
night
visitors
and
he
did
not
think
the
time
was
ripe
for
a
bold
of
one
of
them
nevertheless
he
was
sure
such
an
event
would
discover
lawson
or
some
one
in
that
house
to
be
in
touch
with
crooked
men
laramie
was
right
not
hours
after
his
last
talk
with
duane
in
which
he
advised
quick
action
he
was
found
behind
the
little
bar
of
his
restaurant
with
a
in
his
breast
dead
no
one
could
be
found
who
had
heard
a
shot
it
had
been
deliberate
murder
for
upon
the
bar
had
been
left
a
piece
of
paper
rudely
scrawled
with
a
pencil
friends
of
rangers
look
for
the
this
roused
duane
his
first
move
however
was
to
bury
laramie
none
of
laramie
neighbors
evinced
any
interest
in
the
dead
man
or
the
unfortunate
family
he
had
left
duane
saw
that
these
neighbors
were
held
in
check
by
fear
laramie
was
ill
the
shock
of
her
death
was
hard
on
her
and
she
had
been
left
almost
destitute
with
five
children
duane
rented
a
small
adobe
house
on
the
outskirts
of
town
and
moved
the
family
into
it
then
he
played
the
part
of
provider
and
nurse
and
friend
after
several
days
duane
went
boldly
into
town
and
showed
that
he
meant
business
it
was
his
opinion
that
there
were
men
in
fairdale
secretly
glad
of
a
ranger
presence
what
he
intended
to
do
was
food
for
great
speculation
a
company
of
militia
could
not
have
had
the
effect
upon
the
wild
element
of
fairdale
that
duane
presence
had
it
got
out
that
he
was
a
gunman
lightning
swift
on
the
draw
it
was
death
to
face
him
he
had
killed
thirty
men
wildest
rumor
of
all
it
was
actually
said
of
him
he
had
the
of
buck
duane
or
of
poggin
at
first
there
had
not
only
been
great
conjecture
among
the
vicious
element
but
also
a
very
decided
checking
of
all
kinds
of
action
calculated
to
be
conspicuous
to
a
ranger
at
the
tables
at
the
bars
and
duane
heard
the
remarks
thet
ranger
after
what
he
do
fust
off
is
he
waitin
fer
somebody
who
to
draw
on
him
fust
an
go
to
hell
jest
about
how
soon
will
he
be
found
somewheres
full
of
lead
when
it
came
out
somewhere
that
duane
was
openly
cultivating
the
honest
citizens
to
array
them
in
time
against
the
other
element
then
fairdale
showed
its
several
times
duane
was
shot
at
in
the
dark
and
once
slightly
injured
rumor
had
it
that
poggin
the
gunman
was
coming
to
meet
him
but
the
lawless
element
did
not
rise
up
in
a
mass
to
slay
duane
on
sight
it
was
not
so
much
that
the
enemies
of
the
law
awaited
his
next
move
but
just
a
slowness
peculiar
to
the
frontier
the
ranger
was
in
their
midst
he
was
interesting
if
formidable
he
would
have
been
welcomed
at
at
the
bars
to
play
and
drink
with
the
men
who
knew
they
were
under
suspicion
there
was
a
rude
kind
of
good
humor
even
in
their
open
hostility
besides
one
ranger
or
a
company
of
rangers
could
not
have
held
the
undivided
attention
of
these
men
from
their
games
and
drinks
and
quarrels
except
by
some
decided
move
excitement
greed
appetite
were
rife
in
them
duane
marked
however
a
striking
exception
to
the
usual
run
of
strangers
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
seeing
snecker
had
gone
or
was
under
cover
again
duane
caught
a
vague
rumor
of
the
coming
of
poggin
yet
he
never
seemed
to
arrive
moreover
the
among
the
habitues
of
the
resorts
and
the
cowboys
who
came
in
to
drink
and
gamble
were
unusually
mild
in
comparison
with
former
conduct
this
lull
however
did
not
deceive
duane
it
could
not
last
the
wonder
was
that
it
had
lasted
so
long
duane
went
often
to
see
laramie
and
her
children
one
afternoon
while
he
was
there
he
saw
miss
longstreth
and
ruth
ride
up
to
the
door
they
carried
a
basket
evidently
they
had
heard
of
trouble
duane
felt
strangely
glad
but
he
went
into
an
adjoining
room
rather
than
meet
them
laramie
i
come
to
see
you
said
miss
longstreth
cheerfully
the
little
room
was
not
very
light
there
being
only
one
window
and
the
doors
but
duane
could
see
plainly
enough
laramie
lay
and
haggard
on
a
bed
once
she
had
evidently
been
a
woman
of
some
comeliness
the
ravages
of
trouble
and
grief
were
there
to
read
in
her
worn
face
it
had
not
however
any
of
the
hard
and
bitter
lines
that
had
characterized
her
husband
duane
wondered
considering
that
longstreth
had
ruined
laramie
how
laramie
was
going
to
regard
the
daughter
of
an
enemy
you
granger
longstreth
girl
queried
the
woman
with
her
bright
black
eyes
fixed
on
her
visitor
replied
miss
longstreth
simply
is
my
cousin
ruth
herbert
we
come
to
nurse
you
take
care
of
the
children
help
you
in
any
way
you
let
there
was
a
long
silence
you
look
a
little
like
longstreth
finally
said
laramie
you
not
at
all
like
him
you
must
take
after
your
mother
miss
longstreth
i
do
know
if
i
can
if
i
ought
accept
anything
from
you
your
father
ruined
my
i
know
replied
the
girl
sadly
all
the
more
reason
you
should
let
me
help
you
pray
do
refuse
it
will
mean
so
much
to
if
this
poor
stricken
woman
had
any
resentment
it
speedily
melted
in
the
warmth
and
sweetness
of
miss
longstreth
manner
duane
idea
was
that
the
impression
of
ray
longstreth
beauty
was
always
swiftly
succeeded
by
that
of
her
generosity
and
nobility
at
any
rate
she
had
started
well
with
laramie
and
no
sooner
had
she
begun
to
talk
to
the
children
than
both
they
and
the
mother
were
won
the
opening
of
that
big
basket
was
an
event
poor
starved
little
beggars
duane
feelings
seemed
too
easily
roused
hard
indeed
would
it
have
gone
with
jim
laramie
slayer
if
he
could
have
laid
eyes
on
him
then
however
miss
longstreth
and
ruth
after
the
nature
of
tender
and
practical
girls
did
not
appear
to
take
the
sad
situation
to
heart
the
havoc
was
wrought
in
that
household
the
needs
now
were
cheerfulness
kindness
help
action
and
these
the
girls
furnished
with
a
spirit
that
did
duane
good
laramie
who
dressed
this
baby
presently
asked
miss
longstreth
duane
peeped
in
to
see
a
dilapidated
youngster
on
her
knee
that
sight
if
any
other
was
needed
completed
his
full
and
splendid
estimate
of
ray
longstreth
and
wrought
strangely
upon
his
heart
ranger
replied
laramie
ranger
exclaimed
miss
longstreth
he
taken
care
of
us
all
since
since
laramie
choked
so
you
had
no
help
but
his
replied
miss
longstreth
hastily
women
too
bad
i
send
some
one
laramie
and
i
come
be
good
of
you
went
on
the
older
woman
see
jim
had
few
friends
that
is
right
in
town
and
they
been
afraid
to
help
us
afraid
they
get
what
poor
jim
awful
burst
out
miss
longstreth
passionately
brave
lot
of
friends
laramie
do
you
worry
any
more
we
take
care
of
you
here
ruth
help
me
whatever
is
the
matter
with
baby
dress
manifestly
miss
longstreth
had
some
difficulty
in
subduing
her
emotion
it
on
hind
side
before
declared
ruth
guess
ranger
has
dressed
many
did
the
best
he
could
said
laramie
only
knows
what
would
have
become
of
us
he
is
is
something
more
than
a
ranger
queried
miss
longstreth
with
a
little
break
in
her
voice
more
than
i
can
tell
replied
laramie
buried
jim
he
paid
our
debts
he
fetched
us
here
he
bought
food
for
us
he
cooked
for
us
and
fed
us
he
washed
and
dressed
the
baby
he
sat
with
me
the
first
two
nights
after
jim
death
when
i
thought
i
die
myself
he
so
kind
so
gentle
so
patient
he
has
kept
me
up
just
by
being
near
sometimes
i
wake
from
a
doze
an
seeing
him
there
i
know
how
false
were
all
these
tales
jim
heard
about
him
and
believed
at
first
why
he
plays
with
the
children
just
just
like
any
good
man
might
when
he
has
the
baby
up
i
just
ca
believe
he
a
bloody
gunman
as
they
say
he
good
but
he
is
happy
he
has
such
sad
eyes
he
looks
far
off
sometimes
when
the
children
climb
round
him
they
love
him
his
life
is
sad
nobody
need
tell
me
he
sees
the
good
in
things
once
he
said
somebody
had
to
be
a
ranger
well
i
say
god
for
a
ranger
like
him
duane
did
not
want
to
hear
more
so
he
walked
into
the
room
was
thoughtful
of
you
duane
said
are
needed
here
i
could
do
so
little
laramie
you
look
better
already
i
glad
and
here
baby
all
clean
and
white
baby
what
a
time
i
had
trying
to
puzzle
out
the
way
your
clothes
went
on
well
laramie
did
i
tell
you
friends
would
come
so
will
the
brighter
i
more
faith
than
i
had
replied
laramie
longstreth
daughter
has
come
to
me
there
for
a
while
after
death
i
thought
i
sink
we
have
nothing
how
could
i
ever
take
care
of
my
little
ones
but
i
gaining
courage
to
laramie
do
not

ranger

called
miss
longstreth
as
he
went
out
she
was
white
and
wonderful
she
stepped
out
of
the
door
close
to
him
have
wronged
you
she
said
impulsively
longstreth
how
can
you
say
that
he
returned
believed
what
my
father
and
floyd
lawson
said
about
you
now
i

i

me
very
glad
but
miss
longstreth
please
do
speak
of
wronging
me
i
have
been
a
a
gunman
i
am
a
ranger
and
much
said
of
me
is
true
my
duty
is
hard
on
others
sometimes
on
those
who
are
innocent
alas
but
god
knows
that
duty
is
hard
too
on
did
wrong
you
if
you
entered
my
home
again
i
would
think
it
an
honor
i
please
do
miss
longstreth
interrupted
duane
sir
my
conscience
flays
me
she
went
on
there
was
no
other
sound
like
her
voice
you
take
my
hand
will
you
forgive
me
she
gave
it
royally
while
the
other
was
there
pressing
at
her
breast
duane
took
the
proffered
hand
he
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
then
it
seemed
to
dawn
upon
him
that
there
was
more
behind
this
white
sweet
noble
intensity
of
her
than
just
the
making
amends
for
a
fancied
or
real
wrong
duane
thought
the
man
did
not
live
on
earth
who
could
have
resisted
her
then
honor
you
for
your
goodness
to
this
unfortunate
woman
she
said
and
now
her
speech
came
swiftly
she
was
all
alone
and
helpless
you
were
her
friend
it
was
the
deed
of
a
man
but
laramie
is
the
only
unfortunate
woman
in
the
world
i
too
am
unfortunate
ah
how
i
may
soon
need
a
friend
will
you
be
my
friend
i
so
alone
terribly
worried
i
fear
i
fear
oh
surely
i
need
a
friend
soon
soon
oh
i
afraid
of
what
you
find
out
sooner
or
later
i
want
to
help
you
let
us
save
life
if
not
honor
must
i
stand
alone
all
alone
will
you
will
you
be
her
voice
failed
it
seemed
to
duane
that
she
must
have
discovered
what
he
had
begun
to
suspect
that
her
father
and
lawson
were
not
the
honest
ranchers
they
pretended
to
be
perhaps
she
knew
more
her
appeal
to
duane
shook
him
deeply
he
wanted
to
help
her
more
than
he
had
ever
wanted
anything
and
with
the
meaning
of
the
tumultuous
sweetness
she
stirred
in
him
there
came
realization
of
a
dangerous
situation
must
be
true
to
my
duty
he
said
hoarsely
you
knew
me
you
know
i
could
never
ask
you
to
be
false
to
then
i
do
anything
for
thank
you
i
ashamed
that
i
believed
my
cousin
floyd
he
lied
he
lied
i
all
in
the
dark
strangely
distressed
my
father
wants
me
to
go
back
home
floyd
is
trying
to
keep
me
here
they
quarreled
oh
i
know
something
dreadful
will
happen
i
know
i
need
you
if
if
will
you
help
me
replied
duane
and
his
look
brought
the
blood
to
her
face
chapter
xix
after
supper
duane
stole
out
for
his
usual
evening
spying
the
night
was
dark
without
starlight
and
a
stiff
wind
rustled
the
leaves
duane
bent
his
steps
toward
the
longstreth
ranchhouse
he
had
so
much
to
think
about
that
he
never
knew
where
the
time
went
this
night
when
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
shrubbery
he
heard
lawson
footsteps
and
saw
longstreth
door
open
flashing
a
broad
bar
of
light
in
the
darkness
lawson
crossed
the
threshold
the
door
closed
and
all
was
dark
again
outside
not
a
ray
of
light
escaped
from
the
window
little
doubt
there
was
that
his
talk
with
longstreth
would
be
interesting
to
duane
he
tiptoed
to
the
door
and
listened
but
could
hear
only
a
murmur
of
voices
besides
that
position
was
too
risky
he
went
round
the
corner
of
the
house
this
side
of
the
big
adobe
house
was
of
much
older
construction
than
the
back
and
larger
part
there
was
a
narrow
passage
between
the
houses
leading
from
the
outside
through
to
the
patio
this
passage
now
afforded
duane
an
opportunity
and
he
decided
to
avail
himself
of
it
in
spite
of
the
very
great
danger
crawling
on
very
stealthily
he
got
under
the
shrubbery
to
the
entrance
of
the
passage
in
the
blackness
a
faint
streak
of
light
showed
the
location
of
a
crack
in
the
wall
he
had
to
slip
in
sidewise
it
was
a
tight
squeeze
but
he
entered
without
the
slightest
noise
as
he
progressed
the
passage
grew
a
very
little
wider
in
that
direction
and
that
fact
gave
rise
to
the
thought
that
in
case
of
a
necessary
and
hurried
exit
he
would
do
best
by
working
toward
the
patio
it
seemed
a
good
deal
of
time
was
consumed
in
reaching
a
when
he
did
get
there
the
crack
he
had
marked
was
a
foot
over
his
head
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
find
in
the
crumbling
walls
and
by
bracing
knees
on
one
side
back
against
the
other
hold
himself
up
once
with
his
eye
there
he
did
not
care
what
risk
he
ran
longstreth
appeared
disturbed
he
sat
stroking
his
mustache
his
brow
was
clouded
lawson
face
seemed
darker
more
sullen
yet
lighted
by
some
indomitable
resolve
settle
both
deals
lawson
was
saying
what
i
came
suppose
i
do
choose
to
talk
here
protested
longstreth
impatiently
never
before
made
my
house
a
place
to
waited
long
enough
this
place
as
good
as
any
you
lost
your
nerve
since
that
ranger
hit
the
town
first
now
will
you
give
ray
to
me
you
talk
like
a
spoiled
boy
give
ray
to
you
why
she
a
woman
and
i
finding
out
that
she
got
a
mind
of
her
own
i
told
you
i
was
willing
for
her
to
marry
you
i
tried
to
persuade
her
but
ray
has
any
use
for
you
now
she
liked
you
at
first
but
now
she
does
so
what
can
i
do
can
make
her
marry
me
replied
lawson
that
girl
do
what
she
does
want
to
it
could
be
done
even
if
i
tried
and
i
do
believe
i
try
i
have
the
highest
opinion
of
you
as
a
prospective
floyd
but
if
ray
loved
you
i
would
consent
we
all
go
away
together
before
this
damned
miserable
business
is
out
then
she
never
know
and
maybe
you
might
be
more
like
you
used
to
be
before
the
west
ruined
you
but
as
matters
stand
you
fight
your
own
game
with
her
and
i
tell
you
now
you
you
want
to
let
her
come
out
here
for
demanded
lawson
hotly
was
a
dead
mistake
i
lost
my
head
over
her
i
have
her
or
die
do
you
think
if
she
was
my
wife
i
soon
pull
myself
together
since
she
came
we
none
of
us
been
right
and
the
gang
has
put
up
a
holler
no
longstreth
we
got
to
settle
things
we
can
settle
what
ray
concerned
in
right
now
replied
longstreth
rising
on
we
ask
her
see
where
you
they
went
out
leaving
the
door
open
duane
dropped
down
to
rest
himself
and
to
wait
he
would
have
liked
to
hear
miss
longstreth
answer
but
he
could
guess
what
it
would
be
lawson
appeared
to
be
all
duane
had
thought
him
and
he
believed
he
was
going
to
find
out
presently
that
he
was
worse
the
men
seemed
to
be
absent
a
good
while
though
that
feeling
might
have
been
occasioned
by
duane
thrilling
interest
and
anxiety
finally
he
heard
heavy
steps
lawson
came
in
alone
he
was
humiliated
then
something
abject
in
him
gave
place
to
rage
he
strode
the
room
he
cursed
then
longstreth
returned
now
appreciably
calmer
duane
could
not
but
decide
that
he
felt
relief
at
the
evident
rejection
of
lawson
proposal
fuss
about
it
floyd
he
said
see
i
ca
help
it
pretty
wild
out
here
but
i
ca
rope
my
daughter
and
give
her
to
you
as
i
would
an
unruly
i
can
make
her
marry
me
declared
lawson
thickly
know
the
hold
i
got
on
you
the
deal
that
made
you
boss
of
this
rustler
gang
is
likely
i
forget
replied
longstreth
grimly
can
go
to
ray
tell
her
that
make
her
believe
i
tell
it
broadcast
tell
this
ranger
unless
she
marry
lawson
spoke
breathlessly
with
haggard
face
and
shadowed
eyes
he
had
no
shame
he
was
simply
in
the
grip
of
passion
longstreth
gazed
with
dark
controlled
fury
at
this
relative
in
that
look
duane
saw
a
strong
unscrupulous
man
fallen
into
evil
ways
but
still
a
man
it
betrayed
lawson
to
be
the
wild
and
passionate
weakling
duane
seemed
to
see
also
how
during
all
the
years
of
association
this
strong
man
had
upheld
the
weak
one
but
that
time
had
gone
for
ever
both
in
intent
on
longstreth
part
and
in
possibility
lawson
like
the
great
majority
of
evil
and
unrestrained
men
on
the
border
had
reached
a
point
where
influence
was
futile
reason
had
degenerated
he
saw
only
himself
floyd
ray
the
one
person
on
earth
who
must
never
know
i
a
rustler
a
thief
a
ruler
of
the
worst
gang
on
the
border
replied
longstreth
impressively
floyd
bowed
his
head
at
that
as
if
the
significance
had
just
occurred
to
him
but
he
was
not
long
at
a
loss
going
to
find
it
out
sooner
or
later
i
tell
you
she
knows
now
there
something
wrong
out
here
she
got
eyes
mark
what
i
has
changed
i
know
but
she
has
any
idea
yet
that
her
a
boss
rustler
ray
concerned
about
what
she
calls
my
duty
as
mayor
also
i
think
she
not
satisfied
with
my
explanations
in
regard
to
certain
lawson
halted
in
his
restless
walk
and
leaned
against
the
stone
mantelpiece
he
had
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
squared
himself
as
if
this
was
his
last
stand
he
looked
desperate
but
on
the
moment
showed
an
absence
of
his
usual
nervous
excitement
that
may
well
be
true
he
said
doubt
all
you
say
is
true
but
it
does
help
me
i
want
the
girl
if
i
do
get
her
i
reckon
we
all
go
to
hell
he
might
have
meant
anything
probably
meant
the
worst
he
certainly
had
something
more
in
mind
longstreth
gave
a
slight
start
barely
perceptible
like
the
switch
of
an
awakening
tiger
he
sat
there
head
down
stroking
his
mustache
almost
duane
saw
his
thought
he
had
long
experience
in
reading
men
under
stress
of
such
emotion
he
had
no
means
to
vindicate
his
judgment
but
his
conviction
was
that
longstreth
right
then
and
there
decided
that
the
thing
to
do
was
to
kill
lawson
for
duane
part
he
wondered
that
longstreth
had
not
come
to
such
a
conclusion
before
not
improbably
the
advent
of
his
daughter
had
put
longstreth
in
conflict
with
himself
suddenly
he
threw
off
a
somber
cast
of
countenance
and
he
began
to
talk
he
talked
swiftly
persuasively
yet
duane
imagined
he
was
talking
to
smooth
lawson
passion
for
the
moment
lawson
no
more
caught
the
fateful
significance
of
a
line
crossed
a
limit
reached
a
decree
decided
than
if
he
had
not
been
present
he
was
obsessed
with
himself
how
duane
wondered
had
a
man
of
his
mind
ever
lived
so
long
and
gone
so
far
among
the
exacting
conditions
of
the
southwest
the
answer
was
perhaps
that
longstreth
had
guided
him
upheld
him
protected
him
the
coming
of
ray
longstreth
had
been
the
of
dissension
too
impatient
concluded
longstreth
ruin
any
chance
of
happiness
if
you
rush
ray
she
might
be
won
if
you
told
her
who
i
am
she
hate
you
for
ever
she
might
marry
you
to
save
me
but
she
hate
you
that
is
the
way
wait
play
for
time
be
different
with
her
cut
out
your
drinking
she
despises
that
let
plan
to
sell
out
here
stock
ranch
property
and
leave
the
country
then
you
have
a
show
with
told
you
we
got
to
stick
growled
lawson
gang
stand
for
our
going
it
ca
be
done
unless
you
want
to
sacrifice
mean
the
men
go
without
their
knowing
leave
them
here
to
face
whatever
comes
mean
just
bad
enough
but
not
that
bad
returned
longstreth
i
get
the
gang
to
let
me
off
i
stay
and
face
the
music
all
the
same
lawson
did
it
ever
strike
you
that
most
of
the
deals
the
last
few
years
have
been
yours
if
i
had
rung
them
in
there
would
have
been
any
you
had
cold
feet
and
especially
since
this
ranger
has
been
call
it
cold
feet
if
you
like
but
i
call
it
sense
we
reached
our
limit
long
ago
we
began
by
rustling
a
few
cattle
at
a
time
when
rustling
was
laughed
at
but
as
our
greed
grew
so
did
our
boldness
then
came
the
gang
the
regular
trips
the
one
thing
and
another
till
before
we
knew
it
before
i
knew
it
we
had
shady
deals
holdups
and
murders
on
our
record
then
we
had
to
go
on
too
late
to
turn
back
reckon
we
all
said
that
none
of
the
gang
wants
to
quit
they
all
think
and
i
think
we
ca
be
touched
we
may
be
blamed
but
nothing
can
be
proved
we
too
where
you
dead
wrong
rejoined
longstreth
emphatically
imagined
that
once
not
long
ago
i
was
bullheaded
who
would
ever
connect
granger
longstreth
with
a
rustler
gang
i
changed
my
mind
i
begun
to
think
i
reasoned
out
things
we
crooked
and
we
ca
last
it
the
nature
of
life
even
here
for
conditions
to
grow
better
the
wise
deal
for
us
would
be
to
divide
equally
and
leave
the
country
all
of
you
and
i
have
all
the
stock
all
the
gain
protested
lawson
split
wo
that
settles
that
added
lawson
instantly
longstreth
spread
wide
his
hands
as
if
it
was
useless
to
try
to
convince
this
man
talking
had
not
increased
his
calmness
and
he
now
showed
more
than
impatience
a
dull
glint
gleamed
deep
in
his
eyes
stock
and
property
will
last
a
long
time
do
you
lots
of
good
when
this
ranger
hoarsely
croaked
lawson
the
ranger
name
was
a
match
applied
to
powder
i
told
you
he
be
dead
soon
any
time
same
as
laramie
is
you
mentioned
the
the
supposition
replied
longstreth
sarcastically
inquired
too
just
how
that
very
desired
event
was
to
be
brought
gang
will
lay
him
retorted
longstreth
in
turn
he
laughed
contemptuously
do
be
a
fool
you
been
on
the
border
for
ten
years
packed
a
gun
and
you
used
it
you
been
with
rustlers
when
they
killed
their
men
you
been
present
at
many
fights
but
you
never
in
all
that
time
saw
a
man
like
this
ranger
you
have
got
sense
enough
to
see
him
right
if
you
had
a
chance
neither
have
any
of
you
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
him
is
for
the
gang
to
draw
on
him
all
at
once
then
he
going
to
drop
some
of
you
say
that
like
a
man
who
would
care
much
if
he
did
drop
some
of
them
declared
lawson
and
now
he
was
sarcastic
tell
you
the
truth
i
would
returned
the
other
bluntly
pretty
sick
of
this
lawson
cursed
in
amazement
his
emotions
were
all
out
of
proportion
to
his
intelligence
he
was
not
at
all
duane
had
never
seen
a
vainer
or
more
arrogant
man
i
do
like
your
talk
he
said
you
do
like
the
way
i
talk
you
know
what
you
can
do
replied
longstreth
quickly
he
stood
up
then
cool
and
quiet
with
flash
of
eyes
and
set
of
lips
that
told
duane
he
was
dangerous
after
all
that
neither
here
nor
there
went
on
lawson
unconsciously
cowed
by
the
other
thing
is
do
i
get
the
girl
by
any
means
except
her
not
make
her
marry
me
no
replied
longstreth
his
voice
still
cold
right
then
i
make
evidently
longstreth
understood
the
man
before
him
so
well
that
he
wasted
no
more
words
duane
knew
what
lawson
never
dreamed
of
and
that
was
that
longstreth
had
a
gun
somewhere
within
reach
and
meant
to
use
it
then
heavy
footsteps
sounded
outside
tramping
upon
the
porch
duane
might
have
been
mistaken
but
he
believed
those
footsteps
saved
life
they
are
said
lawson
and
he
opened
the
door
five
masked
men
entered
they
all
wore
coats
hiding
any
weapons
a
big
man
with
burly
shoulders
shook
hands
with
longstreth
and
the
others
stood
back
the
atmosphere
of
that
room
had
changed
lawson
might
have
been
a
nonentity
for
all
he
counted
longstreth
was
another
man
a
stranger
to
duane
if
he
had
entertained
a
hope
of
freeing
himself
from
this
band
of
getting
away
to
a
safer
country
he
abandoned
it
at
the
very
sight
of
these
men
there
was
power
here
and
he
was
bound
the
big
man
spoke
in
low
hoarse
whispers
and
at
this
all
the
others
gathered
around
him
close
to
the
table
there
were
evidently
some
signs
of
membership
not
plain
to
duane
then
all
the
heads
were
bent
over
the
table
low
voices
spoke
queried
answered
argued
by
straining
his
ears
duane
caught
a
word
here
and
there
they
were
planning
and
they
were
brief
duane
gathered
they
were
to
have
a
rendezvous
at
or
near
ord
then
the
big
man
who
evidently
was
the
leader
of
the
present
convention
got
up
to
depart
he
went
as
swiftly
as
he
had
come
and
was
followed
by
his
comrades
longstreth
prepared
for
a
quiet
smoke
lawson
seemed
uncommunicative
and
unsociable
he
smoked
fiercely
and
drank
continually
all
at
once
he
straightened
up
as
if
listening
that
he
called
suddenly
duane
strained
ears
were
pervaded
by
a
slight
rustling
sound
be
a
rat
replied
longstreth
the
rustle
became
a
rattle
like
a
rattlesnake
to
me
said
lawson
longstreth
got
up
from
the
table
and
peered
round
the
room
just
at
that
instant
duane
felt
an
almost
inappreciable
movement
of
the
adobe
wall
which
supported
him
he
could
scarcely
credit
his
senses
but
the
rattle
inside
longstreth
room
was
mingling
with
little
dull
thuds
of
falling
dirt
the
adobe
wall
merely
dried
mud
was
crumbling
duane
distinctly
felt
a
tremor
pass
through
it
then
the
blood
gushed
back
to
his
heart
in
the
hell
exclaimed
longstreth
smell
dust
said
lawson
sharply
that
was
the
signal
for
duane
to
drop
down
from
his
perch
yet
despite
his
care
he
made
a
noise
you
hear
a
step
queried
longstreth
no
one
answered
but
a
heavy
piece
of
the
adobe
wall
fell
with
a
thud
duane
heard
it
crack
felt
it
shake
somebody
between
the
walls
thundered
longstreth
then
a
section
of
the
wall
fell
inward
with
a
crash
duane
began
to
squeeze
his
body
through
the
narrow
passage
toward
the
patio
him
yelled
lawson
side
he
going
that
way
yelled
longstreth
the
tramp
of
heavy
boots
lent
duane
the
strength
of
desperation
he
was
not
shirking
a
fight
but
to
be
cornered
like
a
trapped
coyote
was
another
matter
he
almost
tore
his
clothes
off
in
that
passage
the
dust
nearly
stifled
him
when
he
burst
into
the
patio
it
was
not
a
single
instant
too
soon
but
one
deep
gasp
of
breath
revived
him
and
he
was
up
gun
in
hand
running
for
the
outlet
into
the
court
thumping
footsteps
turned
him
back
while
there
was
a
chance
to
get
away
he
did
not
want
to
fight
he
thought
he
heard
someone
running
into
the
patio
from
the
other
end
he
stole
along
and
coming
to
a
door
without
any
idea
of
where
it
might
lead
he
softly
pushed
it
open
a
little
way
and
slipped
in
chapter
xx
a
low
cry
greeted
duane
the
room
was
light
he
saw
ray
longstreth
sitting
on
her
bed
in
her
with
a
warning
gesture
to
her
to
be
silent
he
turned
to
close
the
door
it
was
a
heavy
door
without
bolt
or
bar
and
when
duane
had
shut
it
he
felt
safe
only
for
the
moment
then
he
gazed
around
the
room
there
was
one
window
with
blind
closely
drawn
he
listened
and
seemed
to
hear
footsteps
retreating
dying
away
then
duane
turned
to
miss
longstreth
she
had
slipped
off
the
bed
half
to
her
knees
and
was
holding
out
trembling
hands
she
was
as
white
as
the
pillow
on
her
bed
she
was
terribly
frightened
again
with
warning
hand
commanding
silence
duane
stepped
softly
forward
meaning
to
reassure
her
she
whispered
wildly
and
duane
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
when
he
got
close
and
looked
into
her
eyes
he
understood
the
strange
dark
expression
in
them
she
was
terrified
because
she
believed
he
meant
to
kill
her
or
do
worse
probably
worse
duane
realized
he
must
have
looked
pretty
hard
and
fierce
bursting
into
her
room
with
that
big
gun
in
hand
the
way
she
searched
duane
face
with
doubtful
fearful
eyes
hurt
him
i
did
know
this
was
your
room
i
came
here
to
get
away
to
save
my
life
i
was
pursued
i
was
spying
on
on
your
father
and
his
men
they
heard
me
but
did
not
see
me
they
do
know
who
was
listening
they
after
me
her
eyes
changed
from
blank
gulfs
to
dilating
shadowing
quickening
windows
of
thought
then
she
stood
up
and
faced
duane
with
the
fire
and
intelligence
of
a
woman
in
her
eyes
me
now
you
were
spying
on
my
father
briefly
duane
told
her
what
had
happened
before
he
entered
her
room
not
omitting
a
terse
word
as
to
the
character
of
the
men
he
had
watched
god
so
it
that
i
knew
something
was
terribly
wrong
here
with
him
with
the
place
the
people
and
right
off
i
hated
floyd
lawson
oh
it
kill
me
if
if
it
so
much
worse
than
i
dreamed
what
shall
i
do
the
sound
of
soft
steps
somewhere
near
distracted
duane
attention
reminded
him
of
her
peril
and
now
what
counted
more
with
him
made
clear
the
probability
of
being
discovered
in
her
room
have
to
get
out
of
here
whispered
duane
she
replied
you
say
they
were
hunting
for
you
sure
are
he
returned
grimly
then
you
must
go
they
might
shoot
you
before
you
got
away
stay
if
we
hear
them
you
can
hide
i
turn
out
the
light
i
meet
them
at
the
door
you
can
trust
me
wait
till
all
quiets
down
if
we
have
to
wait
till
morning
then
you
can
slip
ought
to
stay
i
do
want
to
i
wo
duane
replied
perplexed
and
stubborn
you
must
it
the
only
safe
way
they
wo
come
they
should
it
an
even
chance
longstreth
search
every
room
and
corner
in
this
old
house
if
they
found
me
here
i
start
a
fight
you
might
be
hurt
then
the
fact
of
my
being
here
duane
did
not
finish
what
he
meant
but
instead
made
a
step
toward
the
door
white
of
face
and
dark
of
eye
she
took
hold
of
him
to
detain
him
she
was
as
strong
and
supple
as
a
panther
but
she
need
not
have
been
either
resolute
or
strong
for
the
clasp
of
her
hand
was
enough
to
make
duane
weak
yet
ray
came
longstreth
clear
voice
too
strained
too
eager
to
be
natural
i
in
bed
reading
good
night
instantly
replied
miss
longstreth
so
calmly
and
naturally
that
duane
marveled
at
the
difference
between
man
and
woman
then
she
motioned
for
duane
to
hide
in
the
closet
he
slipped
in
but
the
door
would
not
close
altogether
you
alone
went
on
longstreth
penetrating
voice
she
replied
went
to
the
door
swung
inward
with
a
swift
scrape
and
jar
longstreth
half
entered
haggard
behind
him
duane
saw
lawson
and
indistinctly
another
man
longstreth
barred
lawson
from
entering
which
action
showed
control
as
well
as
distrust
he
wanted
to
see
into
the
room
when
he
had
glanced
around
he
went
out
and
closed
the
door
then
what
seemed
a
long
interval
ensued
the
house
grew
silent
once
more
duane
could
not
see
miss
longstreth
but
he
heard
her
quick
breathing
how
long
did
she
mean
to
let
him
stay
hidden
there
hard
and
perilous
as
his
life
had
been
this
was
a
new
kind
of
adventure
he
had
divined
the
strange
softness
of
his
feeling
as
something
due
to
the
magnetism
of
this
beautiful
woman
it
hardly
seemed
possible
that
he
who
had
been
outside
the
pale
for
so
many
years
could
have
fallen
in
love
yet
that
must
be
the
secret
of
his
agitation
presently
he
pushed
open
the
closet
door
and
stepped
forth
miss
longstreth
had
her
head
lowered
upon
her
arms
and
appeared
to
be
in
distress
at
his
touch
she
raised
a
quivering
face
think
i
can
go
now
safely
he
whispered
then
if
you
must
but
you
may
stay
till
you
safe
she
replied
i
could
thank
you
enough
it
been
hard
on
me
this
finding
out
and
you
his
daughter
i
feel
strange
i
do
understand
myself
well
but
i
want
you
to
know
if
i
were
not
an
outlaw
a
ranger
i
lay
my
life
at
your
you
have
seen
so
so
little
of
me
she
faltered
the
same
it
true
and
that
makes
me
feel
more
the
trouble
my
coming
caused
will
not
fight
my
father
if
i
can
help
it
i
trying
to
get
out
of
his
way
you
spied
upon
am
a
ranger
miss
oh
i
am
a
rustler
daughter
she
cried
so
much
more
terrible
than
i
suspected
it
was
tricky
cattle
deals
i
imagined
he
was
engaged
in
but
only
i
had
strong
suspicions
tell
overheard
floyd
say
that
men
were
coming
to
arrange
a
meeting
for
my
father
at
a
rendezvous
near
ord
father
did
not
want
to
go
floyd
taunted
him
with
a
name
queried
duane
was
my
god
miss
longstreth
why
did
you
tell
me
that
difference
does
that
make
father
and
cheseldine
are
one
and
the
same
whispered
duane
hoarsely
gathered
so
much
myself
she
replied
miserably
longstreth
is
father
real
duane
felt
so
stunned
he
could
not
speak
at
once
it
was
the
girl
part
in
this
tragedy
that
weakened
him
the
instant
she
betrayed
the
secret
duane
realized
perfectly
that
he
did
love
her
the
emotion
was
like
a
great
flood
longstreth
all
this
seems
so
unbelievable
he
whispered
is
the
rustler
chief
i
come
out
here
to
get
he
only
a
name
your
father
is
the
real
man
i
sworn
to
get
him
i
bound
by
more
than
law
or
oaths
i
ca
break
what
binds
me
and
i
must
disgrace
you
wreck
your
lifer
why
miss
longstreth
i
believe
i
i
love
you
it
all
come
in
a
rush
i
die
for
you
if
i
could
how
fatal
terrible
this
is
how
things
work
out
she
slipped
to
her
knees
with
her
hands
on
his
wo
kill
him
she
implored
you
care
for
me
you
wo
kill
him
that
i
promise
with
a
low
moan
she
dropped
her
head
upon
the
bed
duane
opened
the
door
and
stealthily
stole
out
through
the
corridor
to
the
court
when
duane
got
out
into
the
dark
where
his
hot
face
cooled
in
the
wind
his
relief
equaled
his
other
feelings
the
night
was
dark
windy
stormy
yet
there
was
no
rain
duane
hoped
as
soon
as
he
got
clear
of
the
ranch
to
lose
something
of
the
pain
he
felt
but
long
after
he
had
tramped
out
into
the
open
there
was
a
lump
in
his
throat
and
an
ache
in
his
breast
all
his
thought
centered
around
ray
longstreth
what
a
woman
she
had
turned
out
to
be
he
seemed
to
have
a
vague
hopeless
hope
that
there
might
be
there
must
be
some
way
he
could
save
her
chapter
xxi
before
going
to
sleep
that
night
duane
had
decided
to
go
to
ord
and
try
to
find
the
rendezvous
where
longstreth
was
to
meet
his
men
these
men
duane
wanted
even
more
than
their
leader
if
longstreth
or
cheseldine
was
the
brains
of
that
gang
poggin
was
the
executor
it
was
poggin
who
needed
to
be
found
and
stopped
poggin
and
his
men
duane
experienced
a
strange
tigerish
thrill
it
was
thought
of
poggin
more
than
thought
of
success
for
macnelly
plan
duane
felt
dubious
over
this
emotion
next
day
he
set
out
for
bradford
he
was
glad
to
get
away
from
fairdale
for
a
while
but
the
hours
and
the
miles
in
no
wise
changed
the
new
pain
in
his
heart
the
only
way
he
could
forget
miss
longstreth
was
to
let
his
mind
dwell
upon
poggin
and
even
this
was
not
always
effective
he
avoided
sanderson
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
a
half
he
arrived
at
bradford
the
night
of
the
day
before
he
reached
bradford
no
the
mail
and
express
train
going
east
was
held
up
by
the
messenger
killed
over
his
safe
the
wounded
the
bags
carried
away
the
engine
of
no
came
into
town
minus
even
a
tender
and
engineer
and
fireman
told
conflicting
stories
a
posse
of
railroad
men
and
citizens
led
by
a
sheriff
duane
suspected
was
crooked
was
made
up
before
the
engine
steamed
back
to
pick
up
the
rest
of
the
train
duane
had
the
sudden
inspiration
that
he
had
been
cudgeling
his
mind
to
find
and
acting
upon
it
he
mounted
his
horse
again
and
left
bradford
unobserved
as
he
rode
out
into
the
night
over
a
dark
trail
in
the
direction
of
ord
he
uttered
a
short
grim
sardonic
laugh
at
the
hope
that
he
might
be
taken
for
a
he
rode
at
an
easy
trot
most
of
the
night
and
when
the
black
peak
of
ord
mountain
loomed
up
against
the
stars
he
halted
tied
his
horse
and
slept
until
dawn
he
had
brought
a
small
pack
and
now
he
took
his
time
cooking
breakfast
when
the
sun
was
well
up
he
saddled
bullet
and
leaving
the
trail
where
his
tracks
showed
plain
in
the
ground
he
put
his
horse
to
the
rocks
and
brush
he
selected
an
exceedingly
rough
roundabout
and
difficult
course
to
ord
hid
his
tracks
with
the
skill
of
a
fugitive
and
arrived
there
with
his
horse
winded
and
covered
with
lather
it
added
considerable
to
his
arrival
that
the
man
duane
remembered
as
fletcher
and
several
others
saw
him
come
in
the
back
way
through
the
lots
and
jump
a
fence
into
the
road
duane
led
bullet
up
to
the
porch
where
fletcher
stood
wiping
his
beard
he
was
hatless
vestless
and
evidently
had
just
enjoyed
a
morning
drink
dodge
said
fletcher
laconically
duane
replied
and
the
other
man
returned
the
greeting
with
interest
my
hoss
done
up
i
want
to
hide
him
from
any
chance
tourists
as
might
happen
to
ride
up
haw
haw
duane
gathered
encouragement
from
that
chorus
of
coarse
laughter
if
them
tourists
ai
too
durned
snooky
the
hoss
be
safe
in
the
shack
back
of
bill
here
feed
thar
too
but
you
hev
to
rustle
duane
led
bullet
to
the
place
indicated
had
care
of
his
welfare
and
left
him
there
upon
returning
to
the
tavern
porch
duane
saw
the
group
of
men
had
been
added
to
by
others
some
of
whom
he
had
seen
before
without
comment
duane
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
road
and
wherever
one
of
the
tracks
of
his
horse
showed
he
carefully
obliterated
it
this
procedure
was
attentively
watched
by
fletcher
and
his
companions
dodge
remarked
fletcher
as
duane
returned
safer
prayin
fer
duanes
reply
was
a
remark
as
loquacious
as
fletcher
to
the
effect
that
a
long
slow
monotonous
ride
was
conducive
to
thirst
they
all
joined
him
unmistakably
friendly
but
knell
was
not
there
and
most
assuredly
not
poggin
fletcher
was
no
common
outlaw
but
whatever
his
ability
it
probably
lay
in
execution
of
orders
apparently
at
that
time
these
men
had
nothing
to
do
but
drink
and
lounge
around
the
tavern
evidently
they
were
poorly
supplied
with
money
though
duane
observed
they
could
borrow
a
peso
occasionally
from
the
bartender
duane
set
out
to
make
himself
agreeable
and
succeeded
there
was
for
small
stakes
idle
jests
of
coarse
nature
much
bantering
among
the
younger
fellows
and
occasionally
a
mild
quarrel
all
morning
men
came
and
went
until
all
told
duane
calculated
he
had
seen
at
least
fifty
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
a
young
fellow
burst
into
the
saloon
and
yelled
one
word
from
the
scramble
to
get
outdoors
duane
judged
that
word
and
the
ensuing
action
was
rare
in
ord
the
hell
muttered
fletcher
as
he
gazed
down
the
road
at
a
dark
compact
bunch
of
horses
and
riders
time
i
ever
seen
thet
in
ord
we
gettin
popular
like
them
camps
out
of
valentine
wish
phil
was
here
or
poggy
now
all
you
gents
keep
quiet
i
do
the
the
posse
entered
the
town
trotted
up
on
dusty
horses
and
halted
in
a
bunch
before
the
tavern
the
party
consisted
of
about
twenty
men
all
heavily
armed
and
evidently
in
charge
of
a
cowboy
duane
experienced
considerable
satisfaction
at
the
absence
of
the
sheriff
who
he
had
understood
was
to
lead
the
posse
perhaps
he
was
out
in
another
direction
with
a
different
force
jim
fletcher
called
the
cowboy
replied
fletcher
at
his
short
dry
response
and
the
way
he
strode
leisurely
out
before
the
posse
duane
found
himself
modifying
his
contempt
for
fletcher
the
outlaw
was
different
now
we
tracked
a
man
to
all
but
three
miles
of
this
place
tracks
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
found
his
camp
then
he
hit
into
the
brush
an
we
lost
the
trail
did
have
no
tracker
with
us
think
he
went
into
the
mountains
but
we
took
a
chance
an
rid
over
the
rest
of
the
way
seein
ord
was
so
close
anybody
come
in
here
late
last
night
or
early
this
mornin
replied
fletcher
his
response
was
what
duane
had
expected
from
his
manner
and
evidently
the
cowboy
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
he
turned
to
the
others
of
the
posse
entering
into
a
low
consultation
evidently
there
was
difference
of
opinion
if
not
real
dissension
in
that
posse
i
tell
ye
this
was
a
chase
comin
way
out
here
protested
an
old
rancher
hoss
tracks
we
follored
like
any
of
them
we
seen
at
the
where
the
train
was
held
not
so
sure
of
that
replied
the
leader
guthrie
i
follored
tracks
all
my
life
you
could
keep
to
the
trail
this
feller
made
in
the
gim
me
time
an
i
could
thet
takes
time
an
heah
you
go
fer
election
but
it
a
wrong
lead
out
this
way
if
you
right
this
after
he
killed
his
pals
would
hev
rid
back
right
through
town
an
with
them
supposin
they
was
greasers
some
greasers
has
sense
an
when
it
comes
to
thievin
they
shore
we
sent
got
any
reason
to
believe
this
robber
who
murdered
the
greasers
is
a
greaser
himself
i
tell
you
it
was
a
slick
job
done
by
no
ordinary
sneak
did
you
hear
the
facts
one
greaser
hopped
the
engine
an
covered
the
engineer
an
fireman
another
greaser
kept
flashin
his
gun
outside
the
train
the
big
man
who
shoved
back
the
an
did
the
killin
he
was
the
real
gent
an
do
you
forget
some
of
the
posse
sided
with
the
cowboy
leader
and
some
with
the
old
cattleman
finally
the
young
leader
disgustedly
gathered
up
his
bridle
hell
thet
sheriff
shoved
you
off
this
trail
mebbe
he
hed
reasons
savvy
thet
if
i
hed
a
bunch
of
cowboys
with
me
i
tell
you
what
take
a
chance
an
clean
up
this
hole
all
the
while
jim
fletcher
stood
quietly
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
shore
treasurin
up
your
friendly
talk
he
said
the
menace
was
in
the
tone
not
the
content
of
his
speech
can
an
be
damned
to
you
fletcher
called
guthrie
as
the
horses
started
fletcher
standing
out
alone
before
the
others
of
his
clan
watched
the
posse
out
of
sight
fer
thet
poggy
was
here
he
said
as
they
disappeared
then
with
a
thoughtful
mien
he
strode
up
on
the
porch
and
led
duane
away
from
the
others
into
the
when
he
looked
into
duane
face
it
was
somehow
an
entirely
changed
scrutiny
where
you
hide
the
stuff
i
reckon
i
git
in
on
this
deal
seein
i
staved
off
duane
played
his
part
here
was
his
a
tiger
after
prey
he
seized
it
first
he
coolly
eyed
the
outlaw
and
then
disclaimed
any
knowledge
whatever
of
the
other
than
fletcher
had
heard
himself
then
at
fletcher
persistence
and
admiration
and
increasing
show
of
friendliness
he
laughed
occasionally
and
allowed
himself
to
swell
with
pride
though
still
denying
next
he
feigned
a
lack
of
consistent
and
seemed
to
be
wavering
under
fletcher
persuasion
and
grew
silent
then
surly
fletcher
evidently
sure
of
ultimate
victory
desisted
for
the
time
being
however
in
his
solicitous
regard
and
close
companionship
for
the
rest
of
that
day
he
betrayed
the
bent
of
his
mind
later
when
duane
started
up
announcing
his
intention
to
get
his
horse
and
make
for
camp
out
in
the
brush
fletcher
seemed
grievously
offended
do
you
stay
with
me
i
got
a
comfortable
over
here
did
i
stick
by
you
when
guthrie
an
his
bunch
come
up
supposin
i
hed
showed
down
a
cold
hand
to
him
you
be
swingin
somewheres
now
i
tell
you
dodge
it
ai
square
it
i
pay
my
debts
replied
duane
i
ca
put
up
here
all
night
if
i
belonged
to
the
gang
it
be
gang
asked
fletcher
bluntly
fletcher
beard
nodded
as
his
jaw
dropped
duane
laughed
run
into
him
the
other
day
knowed
him
on
sight
sure
he
the
rustler
when
he
seen
me
an
asked
me
what
reason
i
had
for
bein
on
earth
or
some
such
like
why
i
up
an
told
fletcher
appeared
staggered
in
hell
air
you
talkin
about
i
tell
you
once
cheseldine
he
calls
himself
longstreth
over
all
of
fletcher
face
not
covered
by
hair
turned
a
dirty
white
longstreth
he
whispered
hoarsely
almighty
you
braced
the
then
a
remarkable
transformation
came
over
the
outlaw
he
gulped
he
straightened
his
face
he
controlled
his
agitation
but
he
could
not
send
the
healthy
brown
back
to
his
face
duane
watching
this
rude
man
marveled
at
the
change
in
him
the
sudden
checking
movement
the
proof
of
a
wonderful
fear
and
loyalty
it
all
meant
cheseldine
a
master
of
men
air
you
queried
fletcher
in
a
queer
strained
voice
gave
me
a
handle
did
you
dodge
thet
as
good
as
any
shore
it
hits
me
hard
jim
i
been
pretty
lonely
for
years
an
i
in
need
of
pals
think
it
over
will
you
see
you
the
outlaw
watched
duane
go
off
after
his
horse
watched
him
as
he
returned
to
the
tavern
watched
him
ride
out
into
the
darkness
all
without
a
word
duane
left
the
town
threaded
a
quiet
passage
through
cactus
and
mesquite
to
a
spot
he
had
marked
before
and
made
ready
for
the
night
his
mind
was
so
full
that
he
found
sleep
aloof
luck
at
last
was
playing
his
game
he
sensed
the
first
slow
heave
of
a
mighty
crisis
the
end
always
haunting
had
to
be
sternly
blotted
from
thought
it
was
the
approach
that
needed
all
his
mind
he
passed
the
night
there
and
late
in
the
morning
after
watching
trail
and
road
from
a
ridge
he
returned
to
ord
if
jim
fletcher
tried
to
disguise
his
surprise
the
effort
was
a
failure
certainly
he
had
not
expected
to
see
duane
again
duane
allowed
himself
a
little
freedom
with
fletcher
an
attitude
hitherto
lacking
that
afternoon
a
horseman
rode
in
from
bradford
an
outlaw
evidently
well
known
and
liked
by
his
fellows
and
duane
heard
him
say
before
he
could
possibly
have
been
told
the
was
in
ord
that
the
loss
of
money
in
the
holdup
was
slight
like
a
flash
duane
saw
the
luck
of
this
report
he
pretended
not
to
have
heard
in
the
early
twilight
at
an
opportune
moment
he
called
fletcher
to
him
and
linking
his
arm
within
the
outlaw
he
drew
him
off
in
a
stroll
to
a
log
bridge
spanning
a
little
gully
here
after
gazing
around
he
took
out
a
roll
of
bills
spread
it
out
split
it
equally
and
without
a
word
handed
one
half
to
fletcher
with
clumsy
fingers
fletcher
ran
through
the
roll
hundred
he
exclaimed
thet
damn
handsome
of
you
considerin
the
job
was
nothin
interrupted
duane
makin
no
reference
to
a
job
here
or
there
you
did
me
a
good
turn
i
split
my
pile
if
thet
does
make
us
pards
good
turns
an
money
ai
no
use
in
this
fletcher
was
won
the
two
men
spent
much
time
together
duane
made
up
a
short
fictitious
history
about
himself
that
satisfied
the
outlaw
only
it
drew
forth
a
laughing
jest
upon
duane
modesty
for
fletcher
did
not
hide
his
belief
that
this
new
partner
was
a
man
of
achievements
knell
and
poggin
and
then
cheseldine
himself
would
be
persuaded
of
this
fact
so
fletcher
boasted
he
had
influence
he
would
use
it
he
thought
he
pulled
a
stroke
with
knell
but
nobody
on
earth
not
even
the
boss
had
any
influence
on
poggin
poggin
was
concentrated
ice
part
of
the
time
all
the
rest
he
was
bursting
hell
but
poggin
loved
a
horse
he
never
loved
anything
else
he
could
be
won
with
that
black
horse
bullet
cheseldine
was
already
won
by
duane
monumental
nerve
otherwise
he
would
have
killed
duane
little
by
little
the
next
few
days
duane
learned
the
points
he
longed
to
know
and
how
indelibly
they
etched
themselves
in
his
memory
cheseldine
was
on
the
far
slope
of
mount
ord
in
a
deep
valley
he
always
went
there
just
before
a
contemplated
job
where
he
met
and
planned
with
his
lieutenants
then
while
they
executed
he
basked
in
the
sunshine
before
one
or
another
of
the
public
places
he
owned
he
was
there
in
the
ord
den
now
getting
ready
to
plan
the
biggest
job
yet
it
was
a
but
where
fletcher
had
not
as
yet
been
advised
then
when
duane
had
pumped
the
now
amenable
outlaw
of
all
details
pertaining
to
the
present
he
gathered
data
and
facts
and
places
covering
a
period
of
ten
years
fletcher
had
been
with
cheseldine
and
herewith
was
unfolded
a
history
so
dark
in
its
bloody
regime
so
incredible
in
its
brazen
daring
so
appalling
in
its
proof
of
the
outlaw
sweep
and
grasp
of
the
country
from
pecos
to
rio
grande
that
duane
was
stunned
compared
to
this
cheseldine
of
the
big
bend
to
this
rancher
all
the
outlaws
duane
had
ever
known
sank
into
insignificance
the
power
of
the
man
stunned
duane
the
strange
fidelity
given
him
stunned
duane
the
intricate
inside
working
of
his
great
system
was
equally
stunning
but
when
duane
recovered
from
that
the
old
terrible
passion
to
kill
consumed
him
and
it
raged
fiercely
and
it
could
not
be
checked
if
that
poggin
if
that
knell
had
only
been
at
ord
but
they
were
not
and
duane
with
help
of
time
got
what
he
hoped
was
the
upper
hand
of
himself
chapter
xxii
again
inaction
and
suspense
dragged
at
duane
spirit
like
a
leashed
hound
with
a
keen
scent
in
his
face
duane
wanted
to
leap
forth
when
he
was
bound
he
almost
fretted
something
called
to
him
over
the
bold
wild
brow
of
mount
ord
but
while
fletcher
stayed
in
ord
waiting
for
knell
and
poggin
or
for
orders
duane
knew
his
game
was
again
a
waiting
one
but
one
day
there
were
signs
of
the
long
quiet
of
ord
being
broken
a
messenger
strange
to
duane
rode
in
on
a
secret
mission
that
had
to
do
with
fletcher
when
he
went
away
fletcher
became
addicted
to
thoughtful
moods
and
lonely
walks
he
seldom
drank
and
this
in
itself
was
a
striking
contrast
to
former
behavior
the
messenger
came
again
whatever
communication
he
brought
it
had
a
remarkable
effect
upon
the
outlaw
duane
was
present
in
the
tavern
when
the
fellow
arrived
saw
the
few
words
whispered
but
did
not
hear
them
fletcher
turned
white
with
anger
or
fear
perhaps
both
and
he
cursed
like
a
madman
the
messenger
a
lean
fellow
reminding
duane
of
the
cowboy
guthrie
left
the
tavern
without
even
a
drink
and
rode
away
off
to
the
west
this
west
mystified
and
fascinated
duane
as
much
as
the
south
beyond
mount
ord
where
were
knell
and
poggin
apparently
they
were
not
at
present
with
the
leader
on
the
mountain
after
the
messenger
left
fletcher
grew
silent
and
surly
he
had
presented
a
variety
of
moods
to
duane
observation
and
this
latest
one
was
provocative
of
thought
fletcher
was
dangerous
it
became
clear
now
that
the
other
outlaws
of
the
camp
feared
him
kept
out
of
his
way
duane
let
him
alone
yet
closely
watched
him
perhaps
an
hour
after
the
messenger
had
left
not
longer
fletcher
manifestly
arrived
at
some
decision
and
he
called
for
his
horse
then
he
went
to
his
shack
and
returned
to
duane
the
outlaw
looked
in
shape
both
to
ride
and
to
fight
he
gave
orders
for
the
men
in
camp
to
keep
close
until
he
returned
then
he
mounted
here
dodge
he
called
duane
went
up
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
fletcher
walked
his
horse
with
duane
beside
him
till
they
reached
the
log
bridge
when
he
halted
i
in
bad
with
knell
he
said
it
i
the
cause
of
friction
between
knell
an
poggy
knell
never
had
any
use
fer
me
but
poggy

he
left
duane
in
a
quandary
this
news
was
black
things
had
been
working
out
so
well
here
was
a
setback
at
the
moment
duane
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
but
certainly
he
had
no
idea
of
going
back
to
bradford
friction
between
the
two
great
lieutenants
of
cheseldine
open
hostility
between
one
of
them
and
another
of
the
chief
men
among
outlaws
that
sort
of
thing
was
deadly
serious
generally
such
matters
were
settled
with
guns
duane
gathered
encouragement
even
from
disaster
perhaps
the
disintegration
of
cheseldine
great
band
had
already
begun
but
what
did
knell
know
duane
did
not
circle
around
the
idea
with
doubts
and
hopes
if
knell
knew
anything
it
was
that
this
stranger
in
ord
this
new
partner
of
fletcher
was
no
less
than
buck
duane
well
it
was
about
time
thought
duane
that
he
made
use
of
his
name
if
it
were
to
help
him
at
all
that
name
had
been
macnelly
hope
he
had
anchored
all
his
scheme
to
duane
fame
duane
was
tempted
to
ride
off
after
fletcher
and
stay
with
him
this
however
would
hardly
be
fair
to
an
outlaw
who
had
been
fair
to
him
duane
concluded
to
await
developments
and
when
the
gang
rode
in
to
ord
probably
from
their
various
he
would
be
there
ready
to
be
denounced
by
knell
duane
could
not
see
any
other
culmination
of
this
series
of
events
than
a
meeting
between
knell
and
himself
if
that
terminated
fatally
for
knell
there
was
all
probability
of
duane
being
in
no
worse
situation
than
he
was
now
if
poggin
took
up
the
quarrel
here
duane
accused
himself
again
tried
in
vain
to
revolt
from
a
judgment
that
he
was
only
reasoning
out
excuses
to
meet
these
outlaws
meanwhile
instead
of
waiting
why
not
hunt
up
cheseldine
in
his
mountain
retreat
the
thought
no
sooner
struck
duane
than
he
was
hurrying
for
his
horse
he
left
ord
ostensibly
toward
bradford
but
once
out
of
sight
he
turned
off
the
road
circled
through
the
brush
and
several
miles
south
of
town
he
struck
a
narrow
trail
that
fletcher
had
told
him
led
to
cheseldine
camp
the
horse
tracks
along
this
trail
were
not
less
than
a
week
old
and
very
likely
much
more
it
wound
between
low
foothills
through
arroyos
and
gullies
lined
with
mesquite
cottonwood
and
in
an
hour
duane
struck
the
slope
of
mount
ord
and
as
he
climbed
he
got
a
view
of
the
rolling
country
partly
desert
partly
fertile
with
long
bright
lines
of
dry
winding
away
to
grow
dim
in
the
distance
he
got
among
broken
rocks
and
cliffs
and
here
the
open
land
disappeared
and
he
was
hard
put
to
it
to
find
the
trail
he
lost
it
repeatedly
and
made
slow
progress
finally
he
climbed
into
a
region
of
all
rock
benches
rough
here
smooth
there
with
only
an
occasional
scratch
of
iron
horseshoe
to
guide
him
many
times
he
had
to
go
ahead
and
then
work
to
right
or
left
till
he
found
his
way
again
it
was
slow
work
it
took
all
day
and
night
found
him
up
the
mountain
he
halted
at
a
little
with
grass
and
water
and
here
he
made
camp
the
night
was
clear
and
cool
at
that
height
with
a
sky
and
a
streak
of
stars
blinking
across
with
this
day
of
action
behind
him
he
felt
better
satisfied
than
he
had
been
for
some
time
here
on
this
venture
he
was
answering
to
a
call
that
had
so
often
directed
his
movements
perhaps
his
life
and
it
was
one
that
logic
or
intelligence
could
take
little
stock
of
and
on
this
night
lonely
like
the
ones
he
used
to
spend
in
the
nueces
gorge
and
memorable
of
them
because
of
a
likeness
to
that
old
he
felt
the
pressing
return
of
old
haunting
things
the
past
so
long
ago
wild
flights
dead
faces
and
the
places
of
these
were
taken
by
one
quiveringly
alive
white
tragic
with
its
dark
intent
speaking
eyes
ray
longstreth
that
last
memory
he
yielded
to
until
he
slept
in
the
morning
satisfied
that
he
had
left
still
fewer
tracks
than
he
had
followed
up
this
trail
he
led
his
horse
up
to
the
head
of
the
canyon
there
a
narrow
crack
in
low
cliffs
and
with
branches
of
cedar
fenced
him
in
then
he
went
back
and
took
up
the
trail
on
foot
without
the
horse
he
made
better
time
and
climbed
through
deep
clefts
wide
canyons
over
ridges
up
shelving
slopes
along
precipices
a
long
hard
climb
till
he
reached
what
he
concluded
was
a
divide
going
down
was
easier
though
the
farther
he
followed
this
dim
and
winding
trail
the
wider
the
broken
battlements
of
rock
above
him
he
saw
the
black
fringe
of
pinon
and
pine
and
above
that
the
bold
peak
bare
yellow
like
a
desert
butte
once
through
a
wide
gateway
between
great
escarpments
he
saw
the
lower
country
beyond
the
range
and
beyond
this
vast
and
clear
as
it
lay
in
his
sight
was
the
great
river
that
made
the
big
bend
he
went
down
and
down
wondering
how
a
horse
could
follow
that
broken
trail
believing
there
must
be
another
better
one
somewhere
into
cheseldine
he
rounded
a
jutting
corner
where
view
had
been
shut
off
and
presently
came
out
upon
the
rim
of
a
high
wall
beneath
like
a
green
gulf
seen
through
blue
haze
lay
an
amphitheater
walled
in
on
the
two
sides
he
could
see
it
lay
perhaps
a
thousand
feet
below
him
and
plain
as
all
the
other
features
of
that
wild
environment
there
shone
out
a
big
red
stone
or
adobe
cabin
white
water
shining
away
between
great
borders
and
horses
and
cattle
dotting
the
levels
it
was
a
peaceful
beautiful
scene
duane
could
not
help
grinding
his
teeth
at
the
thought
of
rustlers
living
there
in
quiet
and
ease
duane
worked
down
to
the
level
and
well
hidden
in
a
niche
he
settled
himself
to
watch
both
trail
and
valley
he
made
note
of
the
position
of
the
sun
and
saw
that
if
anything
developed
or
if
he
decided
to
descend
any
farther
there
was
small
likelihood
of
his
getting
back
to
his
camp
before
dark
to
try
that
after
nightfall
he
imagined
would
be
vain
effort
then
he
bent
his
keen
eyes
downward
the
cabin
appeared
to
be
a
crude
structure
though
large
in
size
it
had
of
course
been
built
by
outlaws
there
was
no
garden
no
cultivated
field
no
corral
excepting
for
the
rude
pile
of
stones
and
logs
plastered
together
with
mud
the
valley
was
as
wild
probably
as
on
the
day
of
discovery
duane
seemed
to
have
been
watching
for
a
long
time
before
he
saw
any
sign
of
man
and
this
one
apparently
went
to
the
stream
for
water
and
returned
to
the
cabin
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
wall
and
shadows
were
born
in
the
darker
places
of
the
valley
duane
began
to
want
to
get
closer
to
that
cabin
what
had
he
taken
this
arduous
climb
for
he
held
back
however
trying
to
evolve
further
plans
while
he
was
pondering
the
shadows
quickly
gathered
and
darkened
if
he
was
to
go
back
to
camp
he
must
set
out
at
once
still
he
lingered
and
suddenly
his
eye
caught
sight
of
two
horsemen
riding
up
the
valley
the
must
have
entered
at
a
point
below
round
the
huge
abutment
of
rock
beyond
duane
range
of
sight
their
horses
were
tired
and
stopped
at
the
stream
for
a
long
drink
duane
left
his
perch
took
to
the
steep
trail
and
descended
as
fast
as
he
could
without
making
noise
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
reach
the
valley
floor
it
was
almost
level
with
deep
grass
and
here
and
there
clumps
of
bushes
twilight
was
already
thick
down
there
duane
marked
the
location
of
the
trail
and
then
began
to
slip
like
a
shadow
through
the
grass
and
from
bush
to
bush
he
saw
a
bright
light
before
he
made
out
the
dark
outline
of
the
cabin
then
he
heard
voices
a
merry
whistle
a
coarse
song
and
the
clink
of
iron
he
smelled
fragrant
he
saw
moving
dark
figures
cross
the
light
evidently
there
was
a
wide
door
or
else
the
fire
was
out
in
the
open
duane
swerved
to
the
left
out
of
direct
line
with
the
light
and
thus
was
able
to
see
better
then
he
advanced
noiselessly
but
swiftly
toward
the
back
of
the
house
there
were
trees
close
to
the
wall
he
would
make
no
noise
and
he
could
scarcely
be
seen
if
only
there
was
no
but
all
his
outlaw
days
he
had
taken
risks
with
only
his
useless
life
at
stake
now
with
that
changed
he
advanced
stealthy
and
bold
as
an
indian
he
reached
the
cover
of
the
trees
knew
he
was
hidden
in
their
shadows
for
at
few
paces
distance
he
had
been
able
to
see
only
their
tops
from
there
he
slipped
up
to
the
house
and
felt
along
the
wall
with
his
hands
he
came
to
a
little
window
where
light
shone
through
he
peeped
in
he
saw
a
room
shrouded
in
shadows
a
lamp
turned
low
a
table
chairs
he
saw
an
open
door
with
bright
flare
beyond
but
could
not
see
the
fire
voices
came
indistinctly
without
hesitation
duane
stole
farther
along
all
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
cabin
peeping
round
he
saw
only
the
flare
of
light
on
bare
ground
retracing
his
cautious
steps
he
paused
at
the
crack
again
saw
that
no
man
was
in
the
room
and
then
he
went
on
round
that
end
of
the
cabin
fortune
favored
him
there
were
bushes
an
old
shed
a
all
the
cover
he
needed
at
that
corner
he
did
not
even
need
to
crawl
before
he
peered
between
the
rough
corner
of
wall
and
the
bush
growing
close
to
it
duane
paused
a
moment
this
excitement
was
different
from
that
he
had
always
felt
when
pursued
it
had
no
bitterness
no
pain
no
dread
there
was
as
much
danger
here
perhaps
more
yet
it
was
not
the
same
then
he
looked
he
saw
a
bright
fire
a
man
bending
over
it
whistling
while
he
handled
a
steaming
pot
over
him
was
a
roofed
shed
built
against
the
wall
with
two
open
sides
and
two
supporting
posts
duane
second
glance
not
so
blinded
by
the
sudden
bright
light
made
out
other
men
three
in
the
shadow
two
in
the
flare
but
with
backs
to
him
a
smoother
trail
by
long
odds
but
ai
so
short
as
this
one
right
over
the
mountain
one
outlaw
was
saying
eatin
you

ejaculated
another

rode
from
faraway
springs
where

never

you
a
long
time
to

but
i
guess
that
just
as
well
spoke
up
a
smooth
suave
voice
with
a
ring
in
it
longstreth

cheseldine

here
they
were

how
well
duane
remembered
the
names
all
here
the
big
men
of
cheseldine
gang
except
the
biggest
poggin
duane
had
holed
them
and
his
sensations
of
the
moment
deadened
sight
and
sound
of
what
was
before
him
he
sank
down
controlled
himself
silenced
a
mounting
exultation
then
from
a
position
he
peered
forth
again
the
outlaws
were
waiting
for
supper
their
conversation
might
have
been
that
of
cowboys
in
camp
ranchers
at
a
roundup
duane
listened
with
eager
ears
waiting
for
the
business
talk
that
he
felt
would
come
all
the
time
he
watched
with
the
eyes
of
a
wolf
upon
its
quarry
blossom
kane
was
the
messenger
who
had
so
angered
fletcher

a

dark

was
the

merry
profane
a
short
man
resembling
many

duane
had
known
particularly
luke
stevens
and
knell
who
sat
there
tall
slim
like
a
boy
in
build
like
a
boy
in
years
with
his
pale
smooth
expressionless
face
and
his
cold
gray
eyes
and
longstreth
who
leaned
against
the
wall
handsome
with
his
dark
face
and
beard
like
an
aristocrat
resembled
many
a
rich
louisiana
planter
duane
had
met
the
sixth
man
sat
so
much
in
the
shadow
that
he
could
not
be
plainly
discerned
and
though
addressed
his
name
was
not
mentioned
panhandle
smith
carried
pots
and
pans
into
the
cabin
and
cheerfully
called
out
you
gents
air
hungry
fer
grub
do
look
fer
me
to
feed
you
with
a
the
outlaws
piled
inside
made
a
great
bustle
and
clatter
as
they
sat
to
their
meal
like
hungry
men
they
talked
little
duane
waited
there
awhile
then
guardedly
got
up
and
crept
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
cabin
after
he
became
used
to
the
dark
again
he
ventured
to
steal
along
the
wall
to
the
window
and
peeped
in
the
outlaws
were
in
the
first
room
and
could
not
be
seen
duane
waited
the
moments
dragged
endlessly
his
heart
pounded
longstreth
entered
turned
up
the
light
and
taking
a
box
of
cigars
from
the
table
he
carried
it
out
you
fellows
go
outside
and
smoke
he
said
come
on
in
now
let
get
it
he
returned
sat
down
and
lighted
a
cigar
for
himself
he
put
his
booted
feet
on
the
table
duane
saw
that
the
room
was
comfortably
even
luxuriously
furnished
there
must
have
been
a
good
trail
he
thought
else
how
could
all
that
stuff
have
been
packed
in
there
most
assuredly
it
could
not
have
come
over
the
trail
he
had
traveled
presently
he
heard
the
men
go
outside
and
their
voices
became
indistinct
then
knell
came
in
and
seated
himself
without
any
of
his
chief
ease
he
seemed
preoccupied
and
as
always
cold
wrong
knell
why
did
you
get
here
sooner
queried
longstreth
damn

then
some
a
little
liquor
loosens
his
tongue
several
of
the
boys
rode
over
from
ord
an
one
of
them
went
to
poggin
an
says

any
new
man

he
rather
liked
the
way
this
new
part
of
jim
was
boosted
jim
an
poggin
always
hit
it
up
together
so
until
i
got
on
the
deal
jim
pard
was
already
in
the
gang
without
poggin
or

i
got
to
hard
just
where

dug
up
a
lot
of
old
papers
from
my
kit
an
went
over
them
letters
pictures
clippin
an
all
that
i
guess
i
had
a
pretty
good
notion
what
i
was
lookin
for
an
who
i
wanted
to
make
sure
of
at
last
i
found
it
an
i
knew
my
man
but
i
did
spring
it
on
poggin
oh
no
i
want
to
have
some
fun
with
him
when
the
time
comes
he
be
wilder
than
a
trapped
wolf
i
sent
blossom
over
to
ord
to
get
word
from
jim
an
when
he
verified
all
this
talk
i
sent
blossom
again
with
a
message
calculated
to
make
jim
hump
poggin
got
sore
said
he
wait
for
jim
an
i
could
come
over
here
to
see
you
about
the
new
job
he
meet
me
in
knell
had
spoken
hurriedly
and
low
now
and
then
with
passion
his
pale
eyes
glinted
like
fire
in
ice
and
now
his
voice
fell
to
a
whisper
do
you
think
fletcher
new
man
is
demanded
longstreth
duane
down
came
longstreth
boots
with
a
crash
then
his
body
grew
rigid
nueces
outlaw
that
who
killed
bland
alloway
knell
whispered
this
last
name
with
more
feeling
than
the
apparent
circumstance
demanded
and
hardin
the
best
one
of
the
rim
rock
fellows
buck
duane
longstreth
was
so
ghastly
white
now
that
his
black
mustache
seemed
outlined
against
chalk
he
eyed
his
grim
lieutenant
they
understood
each
other
without
more
words
it
was
enough
that
buck
duane
was
there
in
the
big
bend
longstreth
rose
presently
and
reached
for
a
flask
from
which
he
drank
then
offered
it
to
knell
he
waved
it
aside
began
the
chief
slowly
as
he
wiped
his
lips
gathered
you
have
some
grudge
against
this
buck
do
be
a
fool
now
and
do
what
poggin
or
almost
any
of
you
men
would
do
meet
this
buck
duane
i
reason
to
believe
he
a
texas
ranger
hell

say
exclaimed
knell
go
to
ord
and
give
jim
fletcher
a
hunch
he
get
poggin
and
they
fix
even
buck
right
i
do
my
best
but
if
i
run
into
duane
run
into
him
longstreth
voice
fairly
rang
with
the
force
of
its
passion
and
command
he
wiped
his
face
drank
again
from
the
flask
sat
down
resumed
his
smoking
and
drawing
a
paper
from
his
vest
pocket
he
began
to
study
it
i
glad
that
settled
he
said
evidently
referring
to
the
duane
matter
for
the
new
job
this
is
october

eighteenth

or

trail
till

within
sight

it
a
hundred
miles
from
bradford
to
val

about
the
same
from

two
in
the
afternoon
sharp
ride
into

up

clean
fast

details
knell
did
not
even
ask
for
the
dates
again
poggin
or
me
might
be
detained
he
asked
longstreth
bent
a
dark
glance
upon
his
lieutenant
never
can
tell
what
come
off
continued
knell
do
my
minute
you
see
poggin
tell
him
a
job
on
hand
steadies
him
and
i
say
again
look
to
it
that
nothing
happens
either
you
or
poggin
carry
the
job
through
but
i
want
both
of
you
in
it
break
for
the
hills
and
when
you
get
up
in
the
rocks
where
you
can
hide
your
tracks
head
for
mount
ord
when
all
quiet
again
i
join
you
here
that
all
call
in
the
like
a
swift
shadow
and
as
noiseless
duane
stole
across
the
level
toward
the
dark
wall
of
rock
every
nerve
was
a
strung
wire
for
a
little
while
his
mind
was
cluttered
and
clogged
with
whirling
thoughts
from
which
like
a
flashing
scroll
unrolled
the
long
baffling
order
of
action
the
game
was
now
in
his
hands
he
must
cross
mount
ord
at
night
the
feat
was
improbable
but
it
might
be
done
he
must
ride
into
bradford
forty
miles
from
the
foothills
before
eight
next
morning
he
must
telegraph
macnelly
to
be
in
val
verde
on
the
he
must
ride
back
to
ord
to
intercept
knell
face
him
be
denounced
kill
him
and
while
the
iron
was
hot
strike
hard
to
win
poggin
interest
as
he
had
wholly
won
fletcher
failing
that
last
he
must
let
the
outlaws
alone
to
bide
their
time
in
ord
to
be
free
to
ride
on
to
their
new
job
in
val
verde
in
the
mean
time
he
must
plan
to
arrest
longstreth
it
was
a
magnificent
outline
incredible
alluring
unfathomable
in
its
nameless
certainty
he
felt
like
fate
he
seemed
to
be
the
iron
consequences
falling
upon
these
doomed
outlaws
under
the
wall
the
shadows
were
black
only
the
tips
of
trees
and
crags
showing
yet
he
went
straight
to
the
trail
it
was
merely
a
grayness
between
borders
of
black
he
climbed
and
never
stopped
it
did
not
seem
steep
his
feet
might
have
had
eyes
he
surmounted
the
wall
and
looking
down
into
the
ebony
gulf
pierced
by
one
point
of
light
he
lifted
a
menacing
arm
and
shook
it
then
he
strode
on
and
did
not
falter
till
he
reached
the
huge
shelving
cliffs
here
he
lost
the
trail
there
was
none
but
he
remembered
the
shapes
the
points
the
notches
of
rock
above
before
he
reached
the
ruins
of
splintered
ramparts
and
jumbles
of
broken
walls
the
moon
topped
the
eastern
slope
of
the
mountain
and
the
mystifying
blackness
he
had
dreaded
changed
to
magic
silver
light
it
seemed
as
light
as
day
only
soft
mellow
and
the
air
held
a
transparent
sheen
he
ran
up
the
bare
ridges
and
down
the
smooth
slopes
and
like
a
goat
jumped
from
rock
to
rock
in
this
light
he
knew
his
way
and
lost
no
time
looking
for
a
trail
he
crossed
the
divide
and
then
had
all
downhill
before
him
swiftly
he
descended
almost
always
sure
of
his
memory
of
the
landmarks
he
did
not
remember
having
studied
them
in
the
ascent
yet
here
they
were
even
in
changed
light
familiar
to
his
sight
what
he
had
once
seen
was
pictured
on
his
mind
and
true
as
a
deer
striking
for
home
he
reached
the
canyon
where
he
had
left
his
horse
bullet
was
quickly
and
easily
found
duane
threw
on
the
saddle
and
pack
cinched
them
tight
and
resumed
his
descent
the
worst
was
now
to
come
bare
downward
steps
in
rock
sliding
weathered
slopes
narrow
black
gullies
a
thousand
openings
in
a
maze
of
broken
stone
these
duane
had
to
descend
in
fast
time
leading
a
giant
of
a
horse
bullet
cracked
the
loose
fragments
sent
them
rolling
slid
on
the
scaly
slopes
plunged
down
the
steps
followed
like
a
faithful
dog
at
duane
heels
hours
passed
as
moments
duane
was
equal
to
his
great
opportunity
but
he
could
not
quell
that
self
in
him
which
reached
back
over
the
lapse
of
lonely
searing
years
and
found
the
boy
in
him
he
who
had
been
worse
than
dead
was
now
grasping
at
the
skirts
of
life
which
meant
victory
honor
happiness
duane
knew
he
was
not
just
right
in
part
of
his
mind
small
wonder
that
he
was
not
insane
he
thought
he
tramped
on
downward
his
marvelous
faculty
for
covering
rough
ground
and
holding
to
the
true
course
never
before
even
in
flight
so
keen
and
acute
yet
all
the
time
a
spirit
was
keeping
step
with
him
thought
of
ray
longstreth
as
he
had
left
her
made
him
weak
but
now
with
the
game
clear
to
its
end
with
the
trap
to
spring
with
success
strangely
haunting
him
duane
could
not
dispel
memory
of
her
he
saw
her
white
face
with
its
sweet
sad
lips
and
the
dark
eyes
so
tender
and
tragic
and
time
and
distance
and
risk
and
toil
were
nothing
the
moon
sloped
to
the
west
shadows
of
trees
and
crags
now
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
him
the
stars
dimmed
then
he
was
out
of
the
rocks
with
the
dim
trail
pale
at
his
feet
mounting
bullet
he
made
short
work
of
the
long
slope
and
the
foothills
and
the
rolling
land
leading
down
to
ord
the
little
outlaw
camp
with
its
shacks
and
cabins
and
row
of
houses
lay
silent
and
dark
under
the
paling
moon
duane
passed
by
on
the
lower
trail
headed
into
the
road
and
put
bullet
to
a
gallop
he
watched
the
dying
moon
the
waning
stars
and
the
east
he
had
time
to
spare
so
he
saved
the
horse
knell
would
be
leaving
the
rendezvous
about
the
time
duane
turned
back
toward
ord
between
noon
and
sunset
they
would
meet
the
night
wore
on
the
moon
sank
behind
low
mountains
in
the
west
the
stars
brightened
for
a
while
then
faded
gray
gloom
enveloped
the
world
thickened
lay
like
smoke
over
the
road
then
shade
by
shade
it
lightened
until
through
the
transparent
obscurity
shone
a
dim
light
duane
reached
bradford
before
dawn
he
dismounted
some
distance
from
the
tracks
tied
his
horse
and
then
crossed
over
to
the
station
he
heard
the
clicking
of
the
telegraph
instrument
and
it
thrilled
him
an
operator
sat
inside
reading
when
duane
tapped
on
the
window
he
looked
up
with
startled
glance
then
went
swiftly
to
unlock
the
door
give
me
paper
and
pencil
quick
whispered
duane
with
trembling
hands
the
operator
complied
duane
wrote
out
the
message
he
had
carefully
composed
this
repeat
it
to
make
sure
then
keep
mum
i
see
you
again
the
operator
stared
but
did
not
speak
a
word
duane
left
as
stealthily
and
swiftly
as
he
had
come
he
walked
his
horse
a
couple
miles
back
on
the
road
and
then
rested
him
till
break
of
day
the
east
began
to
redden
duane
turned
grimly
in
the
direction
of
ord
when
duane
swung
into
the
wide
grassy
square
on
the
outskirts
of
ord
he
saw
a
bunch
of
saddled
horses
hitched
in
front
of
the
tavern
he
knew
what
that
meant
luck
still
favored
him
if
it
would
only
hold
but
he
could
ask
no
more
the
rest
was
a
matter
of
how
greatly
he
could
make
his
power
felt
an
open
conflict
against
odds
lay
in
the
balance
that
would
be
fatal
to
him
and
to
avoid
it
he
had
to
trust
to
his
name
and
a
presence
he
must
make
terrible
he
knew
outlaws
he
knew
what
qualities
held
them
he
knew
what
to
exaggerate
there
was
not
an
outlaw
in
sight
the
dusty
horses
had
covered
distance
that
morning
as
duane
dismounted
he
heard
loud
angry
voices
inside
the
tavern
he
removed
coat
and
vest
hung
them
over
the
pommel
he
packed
two
guns
one
belted
high
on
the
left
hip
the
other
swinging
low
on
the
right
side
he
neither
looked
nor
listened
but
boldly
pushed
the
door
and
stepped
inside
the
big
room
was
full
of
men
and
every
face
pivoted
toward
him
pale
face
flashed
into
duane
swift
sight
then
boldt
then
blossom
kane
then
panhandle
smith
then
fletcher
then
others
that
were
familiar
and
last
that
of
poggin
though
duane
had
never
seen
poggin
or
heard
him
described
he
knew
him
for
he
saw
a
face
that
was
a
record
of
great
and
evil
deeds
there
was
absolute
silence
the
outlaws
were
lined
back
of
a
long
table
upon
which
were
papers
stacks
of
silver
coin
a
bundle
of
bills
and
a
huge
gun
you
gents
lookin
for
me
asked
duane
he
gave
his
voice
all
the
ringing
force
and
power
of
which
he
was
capable
and
he
stepped
back
free
of
anything
with
the
outlaws
all
before
him
knell
stood
quivering
but
his
face
might
have
been
a
mask
the
other
outlaws
looked
from
him
to
duane
jim
fletcher
flung
up
his
hands
gawd
dodge
what
you
bust
in
here
fer
he
said
plaintively
and
slowly
stepped
forward
his
action
was
that
of
a
man
true
to
himself
he
meant
he
had
been
sponsor
for
duane
and
now
he
would
stand
by
him
fletcher
called
duane
and
his
voice
made
the
outlaw
jump
on
dodge
an
everybody
said
fletcher
me
talk
seein
i
in
wrong
his
persuasions
did
not
ease
the
strain
ahead
talk
said
poggin
fletcher
turned
to
duane
i
takin
it
on
myself
thet
you
meet
enemies
here
when
i
swore
you
meet
friends
it
my
fault
i
stand
by
you
if
you
let
jim
replied
duane
what
you
come
fer
without
the
signal
burst
out
fletcher
in
distress
he
saw
nothing
but
catastrophe
in
this
meeting
i
ai
pressin
my
company
none
but
when
i
wanted
bad
fletcher
stopped
him
with
a
raised
hand
then
he
turned
to
poggin
with
a
rude
dignity
he
my
pard
an
he
riled
i
never
told
him
a
word
make
him
sore
i
only
said
knell
had
no
more
use
fer
him
than
fer
me
now
what
you
say
goes
in
this
gang
i
never
failed
you
in
my
life
here
my
pard
i
vouch
fer
him
will
you
stand
fer
me
there
goin
to
be
hell
if
you
do
an
us
with
a
big
job
on
hand
while
fletcher
toiled
over
his
slow
earnest
persuasion
duane
had
his
gaze
riveted
upon
poggin
there
was
something
leonine
about
poggin
he
was
tawny
he
blazed
he
seemed
beautiful
as
fire
was
beautiful
but
looked
at
closer
with
glance
seeing
the
physical
man
instead
of
that
thing
which
shone
from
him
he
was
of
perfect
build
with
muscles
that
swelled
and
rippled
bulging
his
clothes
with
the
magnificent
head
and
face
of
the
cruel
fierce
jaguar
looking
at
this
strange
poggin
instinctively
divining
his
abnormal
and
hideous
power
duane
had
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
inward
quaking
fear
of
a
man
it
was
like
a
bell
ringing
within
him
and
numbing
his
heart
the
old
instinctive
firing
of
blood
followed
but
did
not
drive
away
that
fear
he
knew
he
felt
something
here
deeper
than
thought
could
go
and
he
hated
poggin
that
individual
had
been

with
a
big
hand
why
he
get
called
an
your
pard
can
set
in
the
every
eye
shifted
to
knell
he
was
dead
white
he
laughed
and
any
one
hearing
that
laugh
would
have
realized
his
intense
anger
equally
with
an
assurance
which
made
him
master
of
the
situation
you
a
gambler
you
are
the
hand
of
the
big
bend
he
said
with
stinging
scorn
bet
you
my
roll
to
a
greaser
peso
that
i
can
deal
you
a
hand
you
be
afraid
to
you
talkin
wild
growled
poggin
with
both
advice
and
menace
in
his
tone
there
anythin
you
hate
it
a
man
who
pretends
to
be
somebody
else
when
he
not
thet
so
poggin
nodded
in
wrath
jim
new
pard
this
man
dodge
he
not
who
he
seems
he
a
hell
of
a
lot
different
but
know
him
an
when
i
spring
his
name
on
you
poggin
you
freeze
to
your
gizzard
do
you
get
me
you
freeze
an
your
hand
be
stiff
when
it
ought
to
be
lightnin
all
because
you
realize
you
been
standin
there
five
minutes
five
minutes
alive
before
him
if
not
hate
then
assuredly
great
passion
toward
poggin
manifested
itself
in
knell
scornful
fiery
address
in
the
shaking
hand
he
thrust
before
poggin
face
in
the
ensuing
silent
pause
knell
panting
could
be
plainly
heard
the
other
men
were
pale
watchful
cautiously
edging
either
way
to
the
wall
leaving
the
principals
and
duane
in
the
center
of
the
room
his
name
then
you
said
poggin
violently
with
a
curse
strangely
knell
did
not
even
look
at
the
man
he
was
about
to
denounce
he
leaned
toward
poggin
his
hands
his
body
his
long
head
all
somewhat
expressive
of
what
his
face
disguised
duane
he
yelled
suddenly
the
name
did
not
make
any
great
difference
in
poggin
but
passionate
swift
utterance
carried
the
suggestion
that
the
name
ought
to
bring
poggin
to
quick
action
it
was
possible
too
that
manner
the
import
of
his
denunciation
the
meaning
back
of
all
his
passion
held
poggin
bound
more
than
the
surprise
for
the
outlaw
certainly
was
surprised
perhaps
staggered
at
the
idea
that
he
poggin
had
been
about
to
stand
sponsor
with
fletcher
for
a
famous
outlaw
hated
and
feared
by
all
outlaws
knell
waited
a
long
moment
and
then
his
face
broke
its
cold
immobility
in
an
extraordinary
expression
of
devilish
glee
he
had
hounded
the
great
poggin
into
something
that
gave
him
vicious
monstrous
joy

broke

stepped
back
from
the
comrade
he
hated
he
was
wet
shaking
haggard
but
magnificent
duane
do
you
remember
hardin
he
asked
in
scarcely
audible
voice
replied
duane
and
a
flash
of
insight
made
clear
attitude
met
him
forced
him
to
draw
killed
him
was
the
best
pard
i
ever
his
teeth
clicked
together
tight
and
his
lips
set
in
a
thin
line
the
room
grew
still
even
breathing
ceased
the
time
for
words
had
passed
in
that
long
moment
of
suspense
knell
body
gradually
stiffened
and
at
last
the
quivering
ceased
he
crouched
his
eyes
had
a
fire
duane
watched
them
he
waited
he
caught
the
thought
the
breaking
of
knell
rigidity
then
he
drew
through
the
smoke
of
his
gun
he
saw
two
red
spurts
of
flame
bullets
thudded
into
the
ceiling
he
fell
with
a
scream
like
a
wild
thing
in
agony
duane
did
not
see
knell
die
he
watched
poggin
and
poggin
like
a
stricken
and
astounded
man
looked
down
upon
his
prostrate
comrade
fletcher
ran
at
duane
with
hands
aloft
the
trail
you
liar
or
you
hev
to
kill
me
he
yelled
with
hands
still
up
he
shouldered
and
bodied
duane
out
of
the
room
duane
leaped
on
his
horse
spurred
and
plunged
away
chapter
xxiii
duane
returned
to
fairdale
and
camped
in
the
mesquite
till
the
of
the
month
the
few
days
seemed
endless
all
he
could
think
of
was
that
the
hour
in
which
he
must
disgrace
ray
longstreth
was
slowly
but
inexorably
coming
in
that
waiting
time
he
learned
what
love
was
and
also
duty
when
the
day
at
last
dawned
he
rode
like
one
possessed
down
the
rough
slope
hurdling
the
stones
and
crashing
through
the
brush
with
a
sound
in
his
ears
that
was
not
all
the
rush
of
the
wind
something
dragged
at
him
apparently
one
side
of
his
mind
was
unalterably
fixed
while
the
other
was
a
hurrying
conglomeration
of
flashes
of
thought
reception
of
sensations
he
could
not
get
calmness
by
and
by
almost
involuntarily
he
hurried
faster
on
action
seemed
to
make
his
state
less
oppressive
it
eased
the
weight
but
the
farther
he
went
on
the
harder
it
was
to
continue
had
he
turned
his
back
upon
love
happiness
perhaps
on
life
itself
there
seemed
no
use
to
go
on
farther
until
he
was
absolutely
sure
of
himself
duane
received
a
clear
warning
thought
that
such
work
as
seemed
haunting
and
driving
him
could
never
be
carried
out
in
the
mood
under
which
he
labored
he
hung
on
to
that
thought
several
times
he
slowed
up
then
stopped
only
to
go
on
again
at
length
as
he
mounted
a
low
ridge
fairdale
lay
bright
and
green
before
him
not
far
away
and
the
sight
was
a
conclusive
check
there
were
mesquites
on
the
ridge
and
duane
sought
the
shade
beneath
them
it
was
the
with
hot
glary
sun
and
no
wind
here
duane
had
to
have
out
his
fight
duane
was
utterly
unlike
himself
he
could
not
bring
the
old
self
back
he
was
not
the
same
man
he
once
had
been
but
he
could
understand
why
it
was
because
of
ray
longstreth
temptation
assailed
him
to
have
her
his
wife
it
was
impossible
the
thought
was
insidiously
alluring
duane
pictured
a
home
he
saw
himself
riding
through
the
cotton
and
rice
and
cane
home
to
a
stately
old
mansion
where
hounds
bayed
him
welcome
and
a
woman
looked
for
him
and
met
him
with
happy
and
beautiful
smile
there
might
there
would
be
children
and
something
new
strange
confounding
with
its
emotion
came
to
life
deep
in
duane
heart
there
would
be
children
ray
their
mother
the
kind
of
life
a
lonely
outcast
always
yearned
for
and
never
had
he
saw
it
all
felt
it
all
but
beyond
and
above
all
other
claims
came
captain
macnelly
it
was
then
there
was
something
cold
and
in
duane
soul
for
he
knew
whatever
happened
of
one
thing
he
was
sure
he
would
have
to
kill
either
longstreth
or
lawson
longstreth
might
be
trapped
into
arrest
but
lawson
had
no
sense
no
control
no
fear
he
would
snarl
like
a
panther
and
go
for
his
gun
and
he
would
have
to
be
killed
this
of
all
consummations
was
the
one
to
be
calculated
upon
duane
came
out
of
it
all
bitter
and
callous
and
sore
in
the
most
fitting
of
moods
to
undertake
a
difficult
and
deadly
enterprise
he
had
fallen
upon
his
old
strange
futile
dreams
now
rendered
poignant
by
reason
of
love
he
drove
away
those
dreams
in
their
places
came
the
images
of
the
longstreth
with
his
sharp
eyes
and
the
dark
lawson
and
then
returned
tenfold
more
thrilling
and
sinister
the
old
strange
passion
to
meet
poggin
it
was
about
one
when
duane
rode
into
fairdale
the
streets
for
the
most
part
were
deserted
he
went
directly
to
find
morton
and
zimmer
he
found
them
at
length
restless
somber
anxious
but
unaware
of
the
part
he
had
played
at
ord
they
said
longstreth
was
home
too
it
was
possible
that
longstreth
had
arrived
home
in
ignorance
duane
told
them
to
be
on
hand
in
town
with
their
men
in
case
he
might
need
them
and
then
with
teeth
locked
he
set
off
for
longstreth
ranch
duane
stole
through
the
bushes
and
trees
and
when
nearing
the
porch
he
heard
loud
angry
familiar
voices
longstreth
and
lawson
were
quarreling
again
how
duane
lucky
star
guided
him
he
had
no
plan
of
action
but
his
brain
was
equal
to
a
hundred
evolutions
he
meant
to
take
any
risk
rather
than
kill
longstreth
both
of
the
men
were
out
on
the
porch
duane
wormed
his
way
to
the
edge
of
the
shrubbery
and
crouched
low
to
watch
for
his
opportunity
longstreth
looked
haggard
and
thin
he
was
in
his
and
he
had
come
out
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
this
he
laid
on
a
table
near
the
wall
he
wore
no
belt
lawson
was
red
bloated
all
fiery
and
sweaty
from
drink
though
sober
on
the
moment
and
he
had
the
expression
of
a
desperate
man
in
his
last
stand
it
was
his
last
stand
though
he
was
ignorant
of
that
your
news
you
need
be
afraid
of
my
feelings
said
lawson
confessed
to
an
interest
in
this
ranger
replied
longstreth
duane
thought
lawson
would
choke
he
was
anyway
and
the
rush
of
blood
made
him
tear
at
the
soft
collar
of
his
shirt
duane
awaited
his
chance
patient
cold
all
his
feelings
shut
in
a
vise
why
should
your
daughter
meet
this
ranger
demanded
lawson
harshly
in
love
with
him
and
he
in
love
with
duane
reveled
in
lawson
condition
the
statement
might
have
had
the
force
of
a
juggernaut
was
longstreth
sincere
what
was
his
game
lawson
finding
his
voice
cursed
ray
cursed
the
ranger
then
longstreth
damned
selfish
fool
cried
longstreth
in
deep
bitter
scorn
you
think
of
is
yourself
your
loss
of
the
girl
think
once
of
me
my
home
my
life
then
the
connection
subtly
put
out
by
longstreth
apparently
dawned
upon
the
other
somehow
through
this
girl
her
father
and
cousin
were
to
be
betrayed
duane
got
that
impression
though
he
could
not
tell
how
true
it
was
certainly
lawson
jealousy
was
his
paramount
emotion
hell
with
you
burst
out
lawson
incoherently
he
was
frenzied
have
her
or
nobody
else
will
never
will
returned
longstreth
stridently
help
me
god
rather
see
her
the
ranger
wife
than
yours
while
lawson
absorbed
that
shock
longstreth
leaned
toward
him
all
of
hate
and
menace
in
his
mien
you
made
me
what
i
am
continued
longstreth
backed
you
shielded
you
you
cheseldine
if
the
truth
is
told
now
ended
i
quit
you
i
done
their
gray
faces
were
still
as
stones
duane
called
in
voice
as
he
stepped
out
both
done
they
wheeled
to
confront
duane
move
not
a
muscle
not
a
finger
he
warned
longstreth
read
what
lawson
had
not
the
mind
to
read
his
face
turned
from
gray
to
ashen
d
mean
yelled
lawson
fiercely
shrilly
it
was
not
in
him
to
obey
a
command
to
see
impending
death
all
quivering
and
strung
yet
with
perfect
control
duane
raised
his
left
hand
to
turn
back
a
lapel
of
his
open
vest
the
silver
star
flashed
brightly
lawson
howled
like
a
dog
with
barbarous
and
insane
fury
with
sheer
impotent
folly
he
swept
a
clawing
hand
for
his
gun
duane
shot
broke
his
action
before
lawson
ever
tottered
before
he
loosed
the
gun
longstreth
leaped
behind
him
clasped
him
with
left
arm
quick
as
lightning
jerked
the
gun
from
both
clutching
fingers
and
sheath
longstreth
protected
himself
with
the
body
of
the
dead
man
duane
saw
red
flashes
puffs
of
smoke
he
heard
quick
reports
something
stung
his
left
arm
then
a
blow
like
wind
light
of
sound
yet
shocking
in
impact
struck
him
staggered
him
the
hot
rend
of
lead
followed
the
blow
duane
heart
seemed
to
explode
yet
his
mind
kept
extraordinarily
clear
and
rapid
duane
heard
longstreth
work
the
action
of
lawson
gun
he
heard
the
hammer
click
fall
upon
empty
shells
longstreth
had
used
up
all
the
loads
in
lawson
gun
he
cursed
as
a
man
cursed
at
defeat
duane
waited
cool
and
sure
now
longstreth
tried
to
lift
the
dead
man
to
edge
him
closer
toward
the
table
where
his
own
gun
lay
but
considering
the
peril
of
exposing
himself
he
found
the
task
beyond
him
he
bent
peering
at
duane
under
lawson
arm
which
flopped
out
from
his
side
longstreth
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
man
who
meant
to
kill
there
was
never
any
mistaking
the
strange
and
terrible
light
of
eyes
like
those
more
than
once
duane
had
a
chance
to
aim
at
them
at
the
top
of
longstreth
head
at
a
strip
of
his
side
longstreth
flung
lawson
body
off
but
even
as
it
dropped
before
longstreth
could
leap
as
he
surely
intended
for
the
gun
duane
covered
him
called
piercingly
to
him
jump
for
the
gun
do
i
kill
you
sure
as
god
i
kill
you
longstreth
stood
perhaps
ten
feet
from
the
table
where
his
gun
lay
duane
saw
him
calculating
chances
he
was
game
he
had
the
courage
that
forced
duane
to
respect
him
duane
just
saw
him
measure
the
distance
to
that
gun
he
was
magnificent
he
meant
to
do
it
duane
would
have
to
kill
him
listen
cried
duane
swiftly
game
up
you
done
but
think
of
your
daughter
i
spare
your
life
i
try
to
get
you
freedom
on
one

her
sake

the
proofs

and
men

my
aid

to
demands
and
i

to
let
you

old
country

for
ray
sake
her
life
perhaps
her
happiness

queried
with
a
dark
and
terrible
earnestness

your
tracks

word
or

sake

second
now

kill
you
right
buck
duane
i
give
my
word
he
said
and
deliberately
walked
to
the
chair
and
fell
into
it
longstreth
looked
strangely
at
the
bloody
blot
on
duane
shoulder
come
the
girls
he
suddenly
exclaimed
you
help
me
drag
lawson
inside
they
must
see
duane
was
facing
down
the
porch
toward
the
court
and
corrals
miss
longstreth
and
ruth
had
come
in
sight
were
swiftly
approaching
evidently
alarmed
the
two
men
succeeded
in
drawing
lawson
into
the
house
before
the
girls
saw
him

only
you
could
have

me
sooner

over
him
the
last
time
and
i
came
near
driving

to
kill
me
too
duane
you
talked

of
it
for
ray
sake

minute

harder
than
facing
a
now
but
i
hope
it
turn
out
all
will
you
do
me
a
favor
he
asked
and
he
seemed
shamefaced
ray
and
ruth
think
lawson
shot
you
he
dead
it
ca
matter
duane
the
old
side
of
my
life
is
coming
back
it
been
coming
be
here
just
about
when
she
enters
this
room
and
by
god
i
change
places
with
lawson
if
i
could
you
said
that
longstreth
replied
duane
sure
lawson
plugged
me
it
our
just
then
ray
and
ruth
entered
the
room
duane
heard
two
low
cries
so
different
in
tone
and
he
saw
two
white
faces
ray
came
to
his
side
she
lifted
a
shaking
hand
to
point
at
the
blood
upon
his
breast
white
and
mute
she
gazed
from
that
to
her
father
cried
ray
wringing
her
hands
give
way
he
replied
huskily
you
girls
will
need
your
nerve
duane
is
badly
hurt
but
floyd
is
is
dead
listen
let
me
tell
it
quick
there
been
a
fight
it
it
was
lawson
it
was
gun
that
shot
duane
duane
let
me
off
in
fact
ray
he
saved
me
to
divide
my
property
return
so
far
as
possible
what
i
stolen
leave
texas
at
once
with
duane
under
arrest
he
says
maybe
he
can
get
macnelly
the
ranger
captain
to
let
me
go
for
your
sake
she
stood
there
realizing
her
deliverance
with
the
dark
and
tragic
glory
of
her
eyes
passing
from
her
father
to
duane
must
rise
above
this
said
duane
to
her
expected
this
to
ruin
you
but
your
father
is
alive
he
will
live
it
down
i
sure
i
can
promise
you
he
be
free
perhaps
back
there
in
louisiana
the
dishonor
will
never
be
known
this
country
is
far
from
your
old
home
and
even
in
san
antonio
and
austin
a
man
evil
repute
means
little
then
the
line
between
a
rustler
and
a
rancher
is
hard
to
draw
in
these
wild
border
days
rustling
is
stealing
cattle
and
i
once
heard
a
rancher
say
that
all
rich
cattlemen
had
done
a
little
stealing
your
father
drifted
out
here
and
like
a
good
many
others
he
succeeded
perhaps
just
as
well
not
to
split
hairs
to
judge
him
by
the
law
and
morality
of
a
civilized
country
some
way
or
other
he
drifted
in
with
bad
men
maybe
a
deal
that
was
honest
somehow
tied
his
hands
this
matter
of
land
water
a
few
stray
head
of
stock
had
to
be
decided
out
of
court
i
sure
in
his
case
he
never
realized
where
he
was
drifting
then
one
thing
led
to
another
until
he
was
face
to
face
with
dealing
that
took
on
crooked
form
to
protect
himself
he
bound
men
to
him
and
so
the
gang
developed
many
powerful
gangs
have
developed
that
way
out
here
he
could
not
control
them
he
became
involved
with
them
and
eventually
their
dealings
became
deliberately
and
boldly
dishonest
that
meant
the
inevitable
spilling
of
blood
sooner
or
later
and
so
he
grew
into
the
leader
because
he
was
the
strongest
whatever
he
is
to
be
judged
for
i
think
he
could
have
been
infinitely
chapter
xxiv
on
the
morning
of
the
duane
rode
into
bradford
in
time
to
catch
the
early
train
his
wounds
did
not
seriously
incapacitate
him
longstreth
was
with
him
and
miss
longstreth
and
ruth
herbert
would
not
be
left
behind
they
were
all
leaving
fairdale
for
ever
longstreth
had
turned
over
the
whole
of
his
property
to
morton
who
was
to
divide
it
as
he
and
his
comrades
believed
just
duane
had
left
fairdale
with
his
party
by
night
passed
through
sanderson
in
the
early
hours
of
dawn
and
reached
bradford
as
he
had
planned
that
fateful
morning
found
duane
outwardly
calm
but
inwardly
he
was
in
a
tumult
he
wanted
to
rush
to
val
verde
would
captain
macnelly
be
there
with
his
rangers
as
duane
had
planned
for
them
to
be
memory
of
that
tawny
poggin
returned
with
strange
passion
duane
had
borne
hours
and
weeks
and
months
of
waiting
had
endured
the
long
hours
of
the
outlaw
but
now
he
had
no
patience
the
whistle
of
the
train
made
him
leap
it
was
a
fast
train
yet
the
ride
seemed
slow
duane
disliking
to
face
longstreth
and
the
passengers
in
the
car
changed
his
seat
to
one
behind
his
prisoner
they
had
seldom
spoken
longstreth
sat
with
bowed
head
deep
in
thought
the
girls
sat
in
a
seat
near
by
and
were
pale
but
composed
occasionally
the
train
halted
briefly
at
a
station
the
latter
half
of
that
ride
duane
had
observed
a
running
parallel
with
the
railroad
sometimes
right
alongside
at
others
near
or
far
away
when
the
train
was
about
twenty
miles
from
val
verde
duane
espied
a
dark
group
of
horsemen
trotting
eastward
his
blood
beat
like
a
hammer
at
his
temples
the
gang
he
thought
he
recognized
the
tawny
poggin
and
felt
a
strange
inward
contraction
he
thought
he
recognized
the
blossom
kane
the
giant
boldt
the
panhandle
smith
and
fletcher
there
was
another
man
strange
to
him
was
that
knell
no
it
could
not
have
been
knell
duane
leaned
over
the
seat
and
touched
longstreth
on
the
shoulder
he
whispered
cheseldine
was
stiff
he
had
already
seen
the
train
flashed
by
the
outlaw
gang
receded
out
of
range
of
sight
you
notice
knell
was
with
them
whispered
duane
duane
did
not
speak
to
longstreth
again
till
the
train
stopped
at
val
verde
they
got
off
the
car
and
the
girls
followed
as
naturally
as
ordinary
travelers
the
station
was
a
good
deal
larger
than
that
at
bradford
and
there
was
considerable
action
and
bustle
incident
to
the
arrival
of
the
train
duane
sweeping
gaze
searched
faces
rested
upon
a
man
who
seemed
familiar
this
fellow
look
too
was
that
of
one
who
knew
duane
but
was
waiting
for
a
sign
a
cue
then
duane
recognized
him
macnelly
without
mustache
he
appeared
different
younger
when
macnelly
saw
that
duane
intended
to
greet
him
to
meet
him
he
hurried
forward
a
keen
light
flashed
from
his
eyes
he
was
glad
eager
yet
suppressing
himself
and
the
glances
he
sent
back
and
forth
from
duane
to
longstreth
were
questioning
doubtful
certainly
longstreth
did
not
look
the
part
of
an
outlaw
lord
i
glad
to
see
you
was
the
captain
greeting
then
at
closer
look
into
duane
face
his
warmth
fled
something
he
saw
there
checked
his
enthusiasm
or
at
least
its
utterance
shake
hand
with
cheseldine
said
duane
the
ranger
captain
stood
dumb
motionless
but
he
saw
instant
action
and
awkwardly
he
reached
for
the
outstretched
hand
of
your
men
down
here
queried
duane
sharply
they
macnelly
you
walk
with
him
we
ladies
in
the
party
i
come
behind
with
they
set
off
longstreth
walked
as
if
he
were
with
friends
on
the
way
to
dinner
the
girls
were
mute
macnelly
walked
like
a
man
in
a
trance
there
was
not
a
word
spoken
in
four
blocks
presently
duane
espied
a
stone
building
on
a
corner
of
the
broad
street
there
was
a
big
sign
the
hotel
said
macnelly
of
my
men
are
there
scattered
they
crossed
the
street
went
through
office
and
lobby
and
then
duane
asked
macnelly
to
take
them
to
a
private
room
without
a
word
the
captain
complied
when
they
were
all
inside
duane
closed
the
door
and
drawing
a
deep
breath
as
if
of
relief
he
faced
them
calmly
longstreth
you
and
miss
ruth
try
to
make
yourselves
comfortable
now
he
said
do
be
then
he
turned
to
his
captain
this
girl
is
the
daughter
of
the
man
i
brought
to
you
and
this
one
is
his
then
duane
briefly
related
longstreth
story
and
though
he
did
not
spare
the
rustler
chief
he
was
generous
i
went
after
longstreth
concluded
duane
was
either
to
kill
him
or
offer
him
freedom
on
conditions
so
i
chose
the
latter
for
his
daughter
sake
he
has
already
disposed
of
all
his
property
i
believe
he
live
up
to
the
conditions
he
to
leave
texas
never
to
return
the
name
cheseldine
has
been
a
mystery
and
now
it
a
few
moments
later
duane
followed
macnelly
to
a
large
room
like
a
hall
and
here
were
men
reading
and
smoking
duane
knew
them
rangers
macnelly
beckoned
to
his
men
here
he
many
men
have
you
asked
duane
macnelly
almost
embraced
duane
would
probably
have
done
so
but
for
the
dark
grimness
that
seemed
to
be
coming
over
the
man
instead
he
glowed
he
sputtered
he
tried
to
talk
to
wave
his
hands
he
was
beside
himself
and
his
rangers
crowded
closer
eager
like
hounds
ready
to
run
they
all
talked
at
once
and
the
word
most
significant
and
frequent
in
their
speech
was
macnelly
clapped
his
fist
in
his
hand
make
the
adjutant
sick
with
joy
maybe
we
wo
have
it
on
the
governor
we
show
them
about
the
ranger
service
duane
how
you
ever
do
it
captain
not
the
half
nor
the
quarter
of
this
job
done
the
gang
coming
down
the
road
i
saw
them
from
the
train
they
ride
into
town
on
the
dot
many
asked
macnelly
blossom
kane
panhandle
smith
boldt
jim
fletcher
and
another
man
i
do
know
these
are
the
picked
men
of
cheseldine
gang
bet
they
be
the
fastest
hardest
bunch
you
rangers
ever
that
the
hard
nut
to
crack
i
heard
their
records
since
i
been
in
val
verde
where
knell
they
say
he
a
boy
but
hell
and
blazes
exclaimed
macnelly
softly
then
he
grew
businesslike
cool
and
of
harder
aspect
it
your
game
i
only
a
ranger
under
orders
we
all
under
your
orders
we
absolute
faith
in
you
make
your
plan
quick
so
i
can
go
around
and
post
the
boys
who
not
understand
there
no
sense
in
trying
to
arrest
poggin
kane
and
that
lot
queried
duane
i
do
understand
that
replied
macnelly
bluntly
ca
be
done
the
drop
ca
be
got
on
such
men
if
you
meet
them
they
shoot
and
mighty
quick
and
straight
poggin
that
outlaw
has
no
equal
with
a
gun
unless
he
got
to
be
killed
quick
they
all
have
to
be
killed
they
all
bad
desperate
know
no
fear
are
lightning
in
well
duane
then
it
a
fight
that
be
easier
perhaps
the
boys
are
spoiling
for
a
fight
out
with
your
plan
one
man
at
each
end
of
this
street
just
at
the
edge
of
town
let
him
hide
there
with
a
rifle
to
block
the
escape
of
any
outlaw
that
we
might
fail
to
get
i
had
a
good
look
at
the
bank
building
well
situated
for
our
purpose
put
four
men
up
in
that
room
over
the
bank
four
men
two
at
each
open
window
let
them
hide
till
the
game
begins
they
want
to
be
there
so
in
case
these
foxy
outlaws
get
wise
before
they
down
on
the
ground
or
inside
the
bank
the
rest
of
your
men
put
inside
behind
the
counters
where
they
hide
now
go
over
to
the
bank
spring
the
thing
on
the
bank
officials
and
do
let
them
shut
up
the
bank
you
want
their
aid
let
them
make
sure
of
their
gold
but
the
clerks
and
cashier
ought
to
be
at
their
desks
or
window
when
poggin
rides
up
he
glance
in
before
he
gets
down
they
make
no
mistakes
these
fellows
we
must
be
slicker
than
they
are
or
lose
when
you
get
the
bank
people
wise
send
your
men
over
one
by
one
no
hurry
no
excitement
no
unusual
thing
to
attract
notice
in
the
right
that
great
tell
me
where
do
you
intend
to
wait
duane
heard
macnelly
question
and
it
struck
him
peculiarly
he
had
seemed
to
be
planning
and
speaking
mechanically
as
he
was
confronted
by
the
fact
it
nonplussed
him
somewhat
and
he
became
thoughtful
with
lowered
head
you
wait
duane
insisted
macnelly
with
keen
eyes
speculating
wait
in
front
just
inside
the
door
replied
duane
with
an
effort
demanded
the
captain
began
duane
slowly
will
get
down
first
and
start
in
but
the
others
wo
be
far
behind
they
not
get
swift
till
inside
the
thing
is
they
must
get
clear
inside
because
the
instant
they
do
they
pull
guns
that
means
death
to
somebody
if
we
can
we
want
to
stop
them
just
at
the
will
you
hide
asked
macnelly
the
idea
had
not
occurred
to
duane
a
doorway
a
sort
of
round
hall
a
vestibule
with
steps
leading
up
to
the
bank
there
a
door
in
the
vestibule
too
it
leads
somewhere
we
can
put
men
in
there
you
can
be
duane
was
silent
here
duane
began
macnelly
nervously
sha
take
any
undue
risk
here
you
hide
with
the
rest
of
us
the
word
was
wrenched
from
duane
macnelly
stared
and
then
a
strange
comprehending
light
seemed
to
flit
over
his
face
i
can
give
you
no
orders
he
said
distinctly
only
offering
advice
need
you
take
any
more
risks
you
done
a
grand
job
for
the
service
already
you
paid
me
a
thousand
times
for
that
pardon
you
redeemed
the
governor
the
the
whole
state
will
rise
up
and
honor
you
the
almost
up
we
kill
these
outlaws
or
enough
of
them
to
break
for
ever
their
power
i
say
as
a
ranger
need
you
take
more
risk
than
your
captain
still
duane
remained
silent
he
was
locked
between
two
forces
and
one
a
tide
that
was
bursting
at
its
bounds
seemed
about
to
overwhelm
him
finally
that
side
of
him
the
retreating
self
the
weaker
found
a
voice
you
want
this
job
to
be
sure
he
asked
told
you
the
way
i
alone
know
the
kind
of
men
to
be
met
just
what
i
do
or
where
i
be
i
ca
say
yet
in
meetings
like
this
the
moment
decides
but
i
be
there
macnelly
spread
wide
his
hands
looked
helplessly
at
his
curious
and
sympathetic
rangers
and
shook
his
head
you
done
your
work
laid
the
trap
is
this
strange
move
of
yours
going
to
be
fair
to
miss
longstreth
asked
macnelly
in
significant
low
voice
like
a
great
tree
chopped
at
the
roots
duane
vibrated
to
that
he
looked
up
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
mercilessly
the
ranger
captain
went
on
can
win
her
duane
oh
you
ca
fool
me
i
was
wise
in
a
minute
fight
with
us
from
cover
then
go
back
to
her
you
will
have
served
the
texas
rangers
as
no
other
man
has
i
accept
your
resignation
you
be
free
honored
happy
that
girl
loves
you
i
saw
it
in
her
eyes
she
but
duane
cut
him
short
with
a
fierce
gesture
he
lunged
up
to
his
feet
and
the
rangers
fell
back
dark
silent
grim
as
he
had
been
still
there
was
a
transformation
singularly
more
sinister
stranger
i
done
he
said
somberly
planned
do
we
agree
or
shall
i
meet
poggin
and
his
gang
alone
macnelly
cursed
and
again
threw
up
his
hands
this
time
in
baffled
chagrin
there
was
deep
regret
in
his
dark
eyes
as
they
rested
upon
duane
duane
was
left
alone
never
had
his
mind
been
so
quick
so
clear
so
wonderful
in
its
understanding
of
what
had
heretofore
been
intricate
and
elusive
impulses
of
his
strange
nature
his
determination
was
to
meet
poggin
meet
him
before
any
one
else
had
a
chance
poggin
first
and
then
the
others
he
was
as
unalterable
in
that
decision
as
if
on
the
instant
of
its
acceptance
he
had
become
stone
why
then
came
realization
he
was
not
a
ranger
now
he
cared
nothing
for
the
state
he
had
no
thought
of
freeing
the
community
of
a
dangerous
outlaw
of
ridding
the
country
of
an
obstacle
to
its
progress
and
prosperity
he
wanted
to
kill
poggin
it
was
significant
now
that
he
forgot
the
other
outlaws
he
was
the
gunman
the
the
passionate
and
terrible
his
father
blood
that
dark
and
fierce
strain
his
mother
spirit
that
strong
and
unquenchable
spirit
of
the
surviving
pioneer
these
had
been
in
him
and
the
killings
one
after
another
the
wild
and
haunted
years
had
made
him
absolutely
in
spite
of
his
will
the
gunman
he
realized
it
now
bitterly
hopelessly
the
thing
he
had
intelligence
enough
to
hate
he
had
become
at
last
he
shuddered
under
the
driving
ruthless
inhuman
of
the
gunman
long
ago
he
had
seemed
to
seal
in
a
tomb
that
horror
of
his
kind
the
need
in
order
to
forget
the
haunting
sleepless
presence
of
his
last
victim
to
go
out
and
kill
another
but
it
was
still
there
in
his
mind
and
now
it
stalked
out
worse
more
powerful
magnified
by
its
rest
augmented
by
the
violent
passions
peculiar
and
inevitable
to
that
strange
wild
product
of
the
texas
frontier
the
and
those
passions
were
so
violent
so
raw
so
base
so
much
lower
than
what
ought
to
have
existed
in
a
thinking
man
actual
pride
of
his
record
actual
vanity
in
his
speed
with
a
gun
actual
jealousy
of
any
rival
duane
could
not
believe
it
but
there
he
was
without
a
choice
what
he
had
feared
for
years
had
become
a
monstrous
reality
respect
for
himself
blindness
a
certain
honor
that
he
had
clung
to
while
in
outlawry
all
like
scales
seemed
to
fall
away
from
him
he
stood
stripped
bare
his
soul
naked
the
soul
of
cain
always
since
the
first
brand
had
been
forced
and
burned
upon
him
he
had
been
ruined
but
now
with
conscience
flayed
to
the
quick
yet
utterly
powerless
over
this
tiger
instinct
he
was
lost
he
said
it
he
admitted
it
and
at
the
utter
abasement
the
soul
he
despised
suddenly
leaped
and
quivered
with
the
thought
of
ray
longstreth
then
came
agony
as
he
could
not
govern
all
the
chances
of
this
fatal
meeting
as
all
his
swift
and
deadly
genius
must
be
occupied
with
poggin
perhaps
in
vain
as
men
whom
he
could
not
watch
would
be
close
behind
this
almost
certainly
must
be
the
end
of
buck
duane
that
did
not
matter
but
he
loved
the
girl
he
wanted
her
all
her
sweetness
her
fire
and
pleading
returned
to
torture
him
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
ray
longstreth
entered
she
said
softly
macnelly
sent
me
to
you
should
have
come
replied
duane
soon
as
he
told
me
i
would
have
come
whether
he
wished
it
or
not
you
left
me
all
of
us
stunned
i
had
no
time
to
thank
you
oh
i
all
my
soul
it
was
noble
of
you
father
is
overcome
he
expect
so
much
and
he
be
true
but
duane
i
was
told
to
hurry
and
here
i
selfishly
using
then
and
leave
me
you
must
unnerve
me
now
when
there
a
desperate
game
to
it
be
desperate
she
whispered
coming
close
to
him
it
ca
be
macnelly
had
sent
her
to
weaken
him
of
that
duane
was
sure
and
he
felt
that
she
had
wanted
to
come
her
eyes
were
dark
strained
beautiful
and
they
shed
a
light
upon
duane
he
had
never
seen
before
going
to
take
some
mad
risk
she
said
me
persuade
you
not
to
you
said
you
cared
for
me
and
i
oh
duane
do
you
know
the
low
voice
deep
sweet
as
an
old
chord
faltered
and
broke
and
failed
duane
sustained
a
sudden
shock
and
an
instant
of
paralyzed
confusion
of
thought
she
moved
she
swept
out
her
hands
and
the
wonder
of
her
eyes
dimmed
in
a
flood
of
tears
god
you
ca
care
for
me
he
cried
hoarsely
then
she
met
him
hands
outstretched
i
do
swift
as
light
duane
caught
her
and
held
her
to
his
breast
he
stood
holding
her
tight
with
the
feel
of
her
warm
throbbing
breast
and
the
clasp
of
her
arms
as
flesh
and
blood
realities
to
fight
a
terrible
fear
he
felt
her
and
for
the
moment
the
might
of
it
was
stronger
than
all
the
demons
that
possessed
him
and
he
held
her
as
if
she
had
been
his
soul
his
strength
on
earth
his
hope
of
heaven
against
his
lips
the
strife
of
doubt
all
passed
he
found
his
sight
again
and
there
rushed
over
him
a
tide
of
emotion
unutterably
sweet
and
full
strong
like
an
intoxicating
wine
deep
as
his
nature
something
glorious
and
terrible
as
the
blaze
of
the
sun
to
one
long
in
darkness
he
had
become
an
outcast
a
wanderer
a
gunman
a
victim
of
circumstances
he
had
lost
and
suffered
worse
than
death
in
that
loss
he
had
gone
down
the
endless
bloody
trail
a
killer
of
men
a
fugitive
whose
mind
slowly
and
inevitably
closed
to
all
except
the
instinct
to
survive
and
a
black
despair
and
now
with
this
woman
in
his
arms
her
swelling
breast
against
his
in
this
moment
almost
of
resurrection
he
bent
under
the
storm
of
passion
and
joy
possible
only
to
him
who
had
endured
so
much
you
care
a
little
he
whispered
unsteadily
he
bent
over
her
looking
deep
into
the
dark
wet
eyes
she
uttered
a
low
laugh
that
was
half
sob
and
her
arms
slipped
up
to
his
neck
littler
oh
duane
duane
a
great
deal
their
lips
met
in
their
first
kiss
the
sweetness
the
fire
of
her
mouth
seemed
so
new
so
strange
so
irresistible
to
duane
his
sore
and
hungry
heart
throbbed
with
thick
and
heavy
beats
he
felt
the
outcast
need
of
love
and
he
gave
up
to
the
enthralling
moment
she
met
him
returned
kiss
for
kiss
clasp
for
clasp
her
face
scarlet
her
eyes
closed
till
her
passion
and
strength
spent
she
fell
back
upon
his
shoulder
duane
suddenly
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
he
divined
then
that
she
had
understood
him
would
have
denied
him
nothing
not
even
her
life
in
that
moment
but
she
was
overcome
and
he
suffered
a
pang
of
regret
at
his
unrestraint
presently
she
recovered
and
she
drew
only
the
closer
and
leaned
upon
him
with
her
face
upturned
he
felt
her
hands
on
his
and
they
were
soft
clinging
strong
like
steel
under
velvet
he
felt
the
rise
and
fall
the
warmth
of
her
breast
a
tremor
ran
over
him
he
tried
to
draw
back
and
if
he
succeeded
a
little
her
form
swayed
with
him
pressing
closer
she
held
her
face
up
and
he
was
compelled
to
look
it
was
wonderful
now
white
yet
glowing
with
the
red
lips
parted
and
dark
eyes
alluring
but
that
was
not
all
there
was
passion
unquenchable
spirit
woman
resolve
deep
and
mighty
love
you
duane
she
said
my
sake
do
go
out
to
meet
this
outlaw
face
to
face
it
something
wild
in
you
conquer
it
if
you
love
duane
became
suddenly
weak
and
when
he
did
take
her
into
his
arms
again
he
scarcely
had
strength
to
lift
her
to
a
seat
beside
him
she
seemed
more
than
a
dead
weight
her
calmness
had
fled
she
was
throbbing
palpitating
quivering
with
hot
wet
cheeks
and
arms
that
clung
to
him
like
vines
she
lifted
her
mouth
to
his
whispering
me
she
meant
to
change
him
hold
him
duane
bent
down
and
her
arms
went
round
his
neck
and
drew
him
close
with
his
lips
on
hers
he
seemed
to
float
away
that
kiss
closed
his
eyes
and
he
could
not
lift
his
head
he
sat
motionless
holding
her
blind
and
helpless
wrapped
in
a
sweet
dark
glory
she
kissed
him
one
long
endless
kiss
or
else
a
thousand
times
her
lips
her
wet
cheeks
her
hair
the
softness
the
fragrance
of
her
the
tender
clasp
of
her
arms
the
swell
of
her
breast
all
these
seemed
to
inclose
him
duane
could
not
put
her
from
him
he
yielded
to
her
lips
and
arms
watching
her
involuntarily
returning
her
caresses
sure
now
of
her
intent
fascinated
by
the
sweetness
of
her
bewildered
almost
lost
this
was
what
it
was
to
be
loved
by
a
woman
his
years
of
outlawry
had
blotted
out
any
boyish
love
he
might
have
known
this
was
what
he
had
to
give
up
all
this
wonder
of
her
sweet
person
this
strange
fire
he
feared
yet
loved
this
mate
his
deep
and
tortured
soul
recognized
never
until
that
moment
had
he
divined
the
meaning
of
a
woman
to
a
man
that
meaning
was
physical
inasmuch
that
he
learned
what
beauty
was
what
marvel
in
the
touch
of
quickening
flesh
and
it
was
spiritual
in
that
he
saw
there
might
have
been
for
him
under
happier
circumstances
a
life
of
noble
deeds
lived
for
such
a
woman
go
do
go
she
cried
as
he
started
violently
must
dear
remember
i
loved
he
pulled
her
hands
loose
from
his
stepped
back
dearest
i
believe
i
come
back
he
whispered
these
last
words
were
falsehood
he
reached
the
door
gave
her
one
last
piercing
glance
to
fix
for
ever
in
memory
that
white
face
with
its
dark
staring
tragic
eyes
he
fled
with
that
moan
like
thunder
death
hell
in
his
ears
to
forget
her
to
get
back
his
nerve
he
forced
into
mind
the
image
of
the
the
like
a
jaguar
with
his
rippling
muscles
he
brought
back
his
sense
of
the
wonderful
presence
his
own
unaccountable
fear
and
hate
yes
poggin
had
sent
the
cold
sickness
of
fear
to
his
marrow
why
since
he
hated
life
so
poggin
was
his
supreme
test
and
this
abnormal
and
stupendous
instinct
now
deep
as
the
very
foundation
of
his
life
demanded
its
wild
and
fatal
issue
there
was
a
horrible
thrill
in
his
sudden
remembrance
that
poggin
likewise
had
been
taunted
in
fear
of
him
so
the
dark
tide
overwhelmed
duane
and
when
he
left
the
room
he
was
fierce
implacable
steeled
to
any
outcome
quick
like
a
panther
somber
as
death
in
the
thrall
of
his
strange
passion
there
was
no
excitement
in
the
street
he
crossed
to
the
bank
corner
a
clock
inside
pointed
the
hour
of
two
he
went
through
the
door
into
the
vestibule
looked
around
passed
up
the
steps
into
the
bank
the
clerks
were
at
their
desks
apparently
busy
but
they
showed
nervousness
the
cashier
paled
at
sight
of
duane
there
were
men
the
rangers
crouching
down
behind
the
low
partition
all
the
windows
had
been
removed
from
the
iron
grating
before
the
desks
the
safe
was
closed
there
was
no
money
in
sight
a
customer
came
in
spoke
to
the
cashier
and
was
told
to
come
duane
returned
to
the
door
he
could
see
far
down
the
street
out
into
the
country
there
he
waited
and
minutes
were
eternities
he
saw
no
person
near
him
he
heard
no
sound
he
was
insulated
in
his
unnatural
strain
at
a
few
minutes
before
half
past
two
a
dark
compact
body
of
horsemen
appeared
far
down
turning
into
the
road
they
came
at
a
sharp
trot
a
group
that
would
have
attracted
attention
anywhere
at
any
time
they
came
a
little
faster
as
they
entered
town
then
faster
still
now
they
were
four
blocks
away
now
three
now
two
duane
backed
down
the
middle
of
the
vestibule
up
the
steps
and
halted
in
the
center
of
the
wide
doorway
there
seemed
to
be
a
rushing
in
his
ears
through
which
pierced
sharp
ringing
of
iron
hoofs
he
could
see
only
the
corner
of
the
street
but
suddenly
into
that
shot
dusty
bay
horses
there
was
a
clattering
of
nervous
hoofs
pulled
to
a
halt
duane
saw
the
tawny
poggin
speak
to
his
companions
he
dismounted
quickly
they
followed
suit
they
had
the
manner
of
ranchers
about
to
conduct
some
business
no
guns
showed
poggin
started
leisurely
for
the
bank
door
quickening
step
a
little
the
others
close
together
came
behind
him
blossom
kane
had
a
bag
in
his
left
hand
jim
fletcher
was
left
at
the
curb
and
he
had
already
gathered
up
the
bridles
poggin
entered
the
vestibule
first
with
kane
on
one
side
boldt
on
the
other
a
little
in
his
rear
as
he
strode
in
he
saw
duane
fire
he
cried
something
inside
duane
burst
piercing
all
of
him
with
cold
was
it
that
fear
duane
echoed
kane
one
instant
poggin
looked
up
and
duane
looked
down
like
a
striking
jaguar
poggin
moved
almost
as
quickly
duane
threw
his
arm
the
guns
boomed
almost
together
duane
felt
a
blow
just
before
he
pulled
trigger
his
thoughts
came
fast
like
the
strange
dots
before
his
eyes
his
rising
gun
had
loosened
in
his
hand
poggin
had
drawn
quicker
a
tearing
agony
encompassed
his
breast
he
pulled
pulled
at
random
thunder
of
booming
shots
all
about
him
red
flashes
jets
of
smoke
shrill
yells
he
was
sinking
the
end
yes
the
end
with
fading
sight
he
saw
kane
go
down
then
boldt
but
supreme
torture
bitterer
than
death
poggin
stood
mane
like
a
lion
back
to
the
wall
grand
with
his
guns
spouting
red
all
faded
darkened
the
thunder
deadened
duane
fell
seemed
floating
there
it
drifted
ray
longstreth
sweet
face
white
with
dark
tragic
eyes
fading
from
his
sight
fading
chapter
xxv
light
shone
before
duane
eyes
thick
strange
light
that
came
and
went
for
a
long
time
dull
and
booming
sounds
rushed
by
filling
all
it
was
a
dream
in
which
there
was
nothing
a
drifting
under
a
burden
darkness
light
sound
movement
and
vague
obscure
sense
of
time
time
that
was
very
long
there
was
fire
creeping
consuming
fire
a
dark
cloud
of
flame
enveloped
him
rolled
him
away
he
saw
then
dimly
a
room
that
was
strange
strange
people
moving
about
over
him
with
faint
voices
far
away
things
in
a
dream
he
saw
again
clearly
and
consciousness
returned
still
unreal
still
strange
full
of
those
vague
and
things
then
he
was
not
dead
he
lay
stiff
like
a
stone
with
a
weight
ponderous
as
a
mountain
upon
him
and
all
his
bound
body
racked
in
slow
agony
a
woman
face
hovered
over
him
white
and
like
one
of
his
old
haunting
phantoms
yet
sweet
and
eloquent
then
a
man
face
bent
over
him
looked
deep
into
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
whisper
from
a
distance
duane
ah
he
knew
me
after
that
there
was
another
long
interval
of
darkness
when
the
light
came
again
clearer
this
time
the
same
man
bent
over
him
it
was
macnelly
and
with
recognition
the
past
flooded
back
duane
tried
to
speak
his
lips
were
weak
and
he
could
scarcely
move
them
he
whispered
his
first
real
conscious
thought
was
for
poggin
ruling
passion
eternal
instinct
is
dead
duane
shot
to
pieces
replied
macnelly
solemnly
a
fight
he
made
he
killed
two
of
my
men
wounded
others
god
he
was
a
tiger
he
used
up
three
guns
before

that
duane
the
whole
southwest
knows
your
story
you
need
never
again
be
ashamed
of
the
name
buck
duane
the
brand
outlaw
is
washed
out
texas
believes
you
been
a
secret
ranger
all
the
time
you
a
hero
and
now
think
of
home
your
mother
of
this
noble
girl
of
your
the
rangers
took
duane
home
to
wellston
a
railroad
had
been
built
since
duane
had
gone
into
exile
wellston
had
grown
a
noisy
crowd
surrounded
the
station
but
it
stilled
as
duane
was
carried
from
the
train
a
sea
of
faces
pressed
close
some
were
faces
he
remembered
schoolmates
friends
old
neighbors
there
was
an
upflinging
of
many
hands
duane
was
being
welcomed
home
to
the
town
from
which
he
had
fled
a
deadness
within
him
broke
this
welcome
hurt
him
somehow
quickened
him
and
through
his
cold
being
his
weary
mind
passed
a
change
his
sight
dimmed
then
there
was
a
white
house
his
old
home
how
strange
yet
how
real
his
heart
beat
fast
had
so
many
many
years
passed
familiar
yet
strange
it
was
and
all
seemed
magnified
they
carried
him
in
these
ranger
comrades
and
laid
him
down
and
lifted
his
head
upon
pillows
the
house
was
still
though
full
of
people
duane
gaze
sought
the
open
door
some
one
entered
a
tall
girl
in
white
with
dark
wet
eyes
and
a
light
upon
her
face
she
was
leading
an
old
lady
somber
and
sad
his
mother
she
was
feeble
but
she
walked
erect
she
was
pale
shaking
yet
maintained
her
dignity
the
some
one
in
white
uttered
a
low
cry
and
knelt
by
duane
bed
his
mother
flung
wide
her
arms
with
a
strange
gesture
man
they
not
brought
back
my
boy
this
man
his
father
where
is
my
son
my
son
oh
my
son
when
duane
grew
stronger
it
was
a
pleasure
to
lie
by
the
west
window
and
watch
uncle
jim
whittle
his
stick
and
listen
to
his
talk
the
old
man
was
broken
now
he
told
many
interesting
things
about
people
duane
had
known
people
who
had
grown
up
and
married
failed
succeeded
gone
away
and
died
but
it
was
hard
to
keep
uncle
jim
off
the
subject
of
guns
outlaws
fights
he
could
not
seem
to
divine
how
mention
of
these
things
hurt
duane
uncle
jim
was
childish
now
and
he
had
a
great
pride
in
his
nephew
he
wanted
to
hear
of
all
of
duane
exile
and
if
there
was
one
thing
more
than
another
that
pleased
him
it
was
to
talk
about
the
bullets
which
duane
carried
in
his
body
bullets
ai
it
he
asked
for
the
hundredth
time
in
that
last
scrap
by
gum
and
you
had
six
before
uncle
replied
duane
and
six
that
makes
eleven
by
gum
a
man
a
man
to
carry
all
that
lead
but
buck
you
could
carry
more
there
that
nigger
edwards
right
here
in
wellston
he
got
a
ton
of
bullets
in
him
does
seem
to
mind
them
none
and
there
cole
miller
i
seen
him
been
a
bad
man
in
his
day
they
say
he
packs
bullets
but
he
bigger
than
you
got
more
flesh
funny
was
it
buck
about
the
doctor
only
bein
able
to
cut
one
bullet
out
of
you
that
one
in
your
breastbone
it
was
a
caliber
an
unusual
cartridge
i
saw
it
and
i
wanted
it
but
miss
longstreth
would
part
with
it
buck
there
was
a
bullet
left
in
one
of
poggin
guns
and
that
bullet
was
the
same
kind
as
the
one
cut
out
of
you
by
gum
boy
it
have
killed
you
if
it
stayed
would
indeed
uncle
replied
duane
and
the
old
haunting
somber
mood
returned
but
duane
was
not
often
at
the
mercy
of
childish
old
uncle
jim
miss
longstreth
was
the
only
person
who
seemed
to
divine
duane
gloomy
mood
and
when
she
was
with
him
she
warded
off
all
suggestion
one
afternoon
while
she
was
there
at
the
west
window
a
message
came
for
him
they
read
it
together
you
have
saved
the
ranger
service
to
the
lone
star
state
macnelley
ray
knelt
beside
him
at
the
window
and
he
believed
she
meant
to
speak
then
of
the
thing
they
had
shunned
her
face
was
still
white
but
sweeter
now
warm
with
rich
life
beneath
the
marble
and
her
dark
eyes
were
still
intent
still
haunted
by
shadows
but
no
longer
tragic
glad
for
macnelly
sake
as
well
as
the
state
said
duane
she
made
no
reply
to
that
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
duane
shrank
a
little
pain
is
it
any
worse
she
asked
instantly
it
the
same
it
will
always
be
the
same
i
full
of
lead
you
know
but
i
do
mind
a
little
it
the
old
mood
the
fear
she
whispered
it
haunts
me
i
be
well
soon
able
to
go
out
then
that
that
hell
will
come
back
no
she
said
with
emotion
drunken
cowboy
some
fool
with
a
gun
will
hunt
me
out
in
every
town
wherever
i
go
he
went
on
miserably
duane
to
kill
buck
duane
do
speak
so
listen
you
remember
that
day
in
val
verde
when
i
came
to
you
plead
with
you
not
to
meet
poggin
oh
that
was
a
terrible
hour
for
me
but
it
showed
me
the
truth
i
saw
the
struggle
between
your
passion
to
kill
and
your
love
for
me
i
could
have
saved
you
then
had
i
known
what
i
know
now
now
i
understand
that
that
thing
which
haunts
you
but
you
never
have
to
draw
again
you
never
have
to
kill
another
man
thank
god
like
a
drowning
man
he
would
have
grasped
at
straws
but
he
could
not
voice
his
passionate
query
she
put
tender
arms
round
his
neck
you
have
me
with
you
always
she
replied
always
i
shall
be
between
you
and
that
that
terrible
it
seemed
with
the
spoken
thought
absolute
assurance
of
her
power
came
to
her
duane
realized
instantly
that
he
was
in
the
arms
of
a
stronger
woman
that
she
who
had
plead
with
him
that
fatal
day
we
be
married
and
leave
texas
she
said
softly
with
the
red
blood
rising
rich
and
dark
in
her
cheeks
we
will
though
you
laggard
in
asking
me
dear
suppose
he
replied
huskily
there
might
be
be
children
a
boy
a
boy
with
his
father
blood
pray
god
there
will
be
i
do
not
fear
what
you
fear
but
even
so
he
be
half
my
duane
felt
the
storm
rise
and
break
in
him
and
his
terror
was
that
of
joy
quelling
fear
the
shining
glory
of
love
in
this
woman
eyes
made
him
weak
as
a
child
how
could
she
love
him
how
could
she
so
bravely
face
a
future
with
him
yet
she
held
him
in
her
arms
twining
her
hands
round
his
neck
and
pressing
close
to
him
her
faith
and
love
and
beauty
these
she
meant
to
throw
between
him
and
all
that
terrible
past
they
were
her
power
and
she
meant
to
use
them
all
he
dared
not
think
of
accepting
her
sacrifice
ray
you
dear
noble
girl
i
poor
i
have
nothing
and
i
a
you
be
well
some
day
she
replied
listen
i
have
money
my
mother
left
me
well
off
all
she
had
was
her
father
do
you
understand
we
take
uncle
jim
and
your
mother
we
go
to
louisiana
to
my
old
home
it
far
from
here
there
a
plantation
to
work
there
are
horses
and
cattle
a
great
cypress
forest
to
cut
oh
you
have
much
to
do
you
forget
there
you
learn
to
love
my
home
it
a
beautiful
old
place
there
are
groves
where
the
gray
moss
blows
all
day
and
the
nightingales
sing
all
darling
cried
duane
brokenly
no
no
yet
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
he
was
yielding
to
her
that
he
could
not
resist
her
a
moment
longer
what
was
this
madness
of
love
be
happy
she
whispered
i
know
come
come
her
eyes
were
closing
and
she
lifted
sweet
tremulous
waiting
lips
with
bursting
heart
duane
bent
to
them
then
he
held
her
close
pressed
to
him
while
with
dim
eyes
he
looked
out
over
the
line
of
low
hills
in
the
west
down
where
the
sun
was
setting
gold
and
red
down
over
the
nueces
and
the
wild
brakes
of
the
rio
grande
which
he
was
never
to
see
again
it
was
in
this
solemn
and
exalted
moment
that
duane
accepted
happiness
and
faced
a
new
life
trusting
this
brave
and
tender
woman
to
be
stronger
than
the
dark
and
fateful
passion
that
had
shadowed
his
past
it
would
come
back
that
wind
of
flame
that
madness
to
forget
that
driving
relentless
instinct
for
blood
it
would
come
back
with
those
pale
drifting
haunting
faces
and
the
accusing
fading
eyes
but
all
his
life
always
between
them
and
him
rendering
them
powerless
would
be
the
faith
and
love
and
beauty
of
this
noble
woman
