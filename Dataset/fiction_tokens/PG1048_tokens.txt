the
ruling
passion
by
henry
van
dyke
a
writer
request
of
his
master
let
me
never
tag
a
moral
to
a
story
nor
tell
a
story
without
a
meaning
make
me
respect
my
material
so
much
that
i
dare
not
slight
my
work
help
me
to
deal
very
honestly
with
words
and
with
people
because
they
are
both
alive
show
me
that
as
in
a
river
so
in
a
writing
clearness
is
the
best
quality
and
a
little
that
is
pure
is
worth
more
than
much
that
is
mixed
teach
me
to
see
the
local
colour
without
being
blind
to
the
inner
light
give
me
an
ideal
that
will
stand
the
strain
of
weaving
into
human
stuff
on
the
loom
of
the
real
keep
me
from
caring
more
for
books
than
for
folks
for
art
than
for
life
steady
me
to
do
my
full
stint
of
work
as
well
as
i
can
and
when
that
is
done
stop
me
pay
what
wages
thou
wilt
and
help
me
to
say
from
a
quiet
heart
a
grateful
amen
preface
in
every
life
worth
writing
about
there
is
a
ruling
passion
very
pulse
of
the
unless
you
touch
that
you
are
groping
around
outside
of
reality
sometimes
it
is
romantic
love
natures
masterpiece
of
interested
benevolence
in
almost
all
lives
this
passion
has
its
season
of
empire
therefore
and
rightly
it
is
the
favourite
theme
of
the
storyteller
romantic
love
interests
almost
everybody
because
almost
everybody
knows
something
about
it
or
would
like
to
know
but
there
are
other
passions
no
less
real
which
also
have
their
place
and
power
in
human
life
some
of
them
come
earlier
and
sometimes
they
last
longer
than
romantic
love
they
play
alongside
of
it
and
are
mixed
up
with
it
now
checking
it
now
advancing
its
flow
and
tingeing
it
with
their
own
colour
just
because
love
is
so
universal
it
is
often
to
one
of
the
other
passions
that
we
must
look
for
the
distinctive
hue
the
individual
quality
of
a
granted
if
you
will
that
everybody
must
fall
in
love
or
ought
to
fall
in
love
how
will
he
do
it
and
what
will
he
do
afterwards
these
are
questions
not
without
interest
to
one
who
watches
the
human
drama
as
a
friend
the
answers
depend
upon
those
hidden
and
durable
desires
affections
and
impulses
to
which
men
and
women
give
themselves
up
for
rule
and
guidance
music
nature
children
honour
strife
revenge
money
pride
friendship
loyalty
duty
to
these
objects
and
others
like
them
the
secret
power
of
personal
passion
often
turns
and
the
life
unconsciously
follows
it
as
the
tides
in
the
sea
follow
the
moon
in
the
sky
when
circumstances
cross
the
ruling
passion
when
rocks
lie
in
the
way
and
winds
are
contrary
then
things
happen
characters
emerge
slight
events
are
significant
mere
adventures
are
transformed
into
a
real
plot
what
care
i
how
many
and
your
hero
may
pass
through
unless
i
know
him
for
a
man
he
is
but
a
puppet
strung
on
wires
his
kisses
are
wooden
and
his
wounds
bleed
sawdust
there
is
nothing
about
him
to
remember
except
his
name
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
dialect
kill
him
or
crown
him
what
difference
does
it
make
but
go
the
other
way
about
your
work
the
least
man
of
all
mankind
as
i
look
at
his
head
and
heart
find
how
and
why
he
differs
from
his
fellows
utterly
and
now
there
is
something
to
tell
with
a
meaning
if
you
tell
it
at
length
it
is
a
novel
a
painting
if
you
tell
it
in
brief
it
is
a
short
story
an
etching
but
the
subject
is
always
the
same
the
unseen
mysterious
ruling
passion
weaving
the
stuff
of
human
nature
into
patterns
wherein
the
soul
is
imaged
and
revealed
to
tell
about
some
of
these
ruling
passions
simply
clearly
and
concretely
is
what
i
want
to
do
in
this
book
the
characters
are
chosen
for
the
most
part
among
plain
people
because
their
feelings
are
expressed
with
fewer
words
and
greater
truth
not
being
costumed
for
social
effect
the
scene
is
laid
on
nature
stage
because
i
like
to
be

i
am

think

the

i
a
lover
of
music
i
he
entered
the
backwoods
village
of
bytown
literally
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
it
whirled
him
along
like
a
big
snowflake
and
dropped
him
at
the
door
of
moody
retreat
as
if
he
were
a
new
year
gift
from
the
north
pole
his
coming
seemed
a
mere
chance
but
perhaps
there
was
something
more
in
it
after
all
at
all
events
you
shall
hear
if
you
will
the
time
and
the
manner
of
his
arrival
it
was
the
last
night
of
december
some
years
ago
all
the
city
sportsmen
who
had
hunted
the
deer
under
bill
moody
direction
had
long
since
retreated
to
their
homes
leaving
the
little
settlement
on
the
border
of
the
adirondack
wilderness
wholly
under
the
social
direction
of
the
natives
the
annual
ball
was
in
full
swing
in
the
of
the
hotel
at
one
side
of
the
room
the
tables
and
chairs
were
piled
up
with
their
legs
projecting
in
the
air
like
a
thicket
of
very
dead
trees
the
huge
stove
in
the
southeast
corner
was
blushing
a
rosy
red
through
its
thin
coat
of
whitewash
and
exhaling
a
furious
dry
heat
flavoured
with
the
smell
of
baked
iron
at
the
north
end
however
winter
reigned
and
there
were
tiny
ridges
of
fine
snow
on
the
floor
sifted
in
by
the
wind
through
the
cracks
in
the
but
the
bouncing
girls
and
the
guides
and
lumbermen
who
filled
the
did
not
appear
to
mind
the
heat
or
the
cold
they
balanced
and
from
the
tropics
to
the
arctic
circle
they
swung
at
corners
and
made
all
through
the
temperate
zone
they
stamped
their
feet
and
did
until
the
floor
trembled
beneath
them
the
tin
on
the
walls
rattled
like
castanets
there
was
only
one
drawback
to
the
hilarity
of
the
occasion
the
band
which
was
usually
imported
from
sandy
river
forks
for
such
festivities
a
fiddle
a
cornet
a
flute
and
an
accordion
had
not
arrived
there
was
a
general
idea
that
the
in
which
the
musicians
were
to
travel
had
been
delayed
by
the
storm
and
might
break
its
way
through
the
and
arrive
at
any
moment
but
bill
moody
who
was
naturally
of
a
pessimistic
temperament
had
offered
a
different
explanation
tell
ye
old
baker
got
that
blame
band
down
to
his
hotel
at
the
falls
now
makin
play
fer
his
party
them
music
fellers
is
onsartin
ca
trust
to
keep
anythin
the
toon
and
they
do
alluz
keep
that
guess
we
might
uz
well
shet
up
this
ball
or
go
to
work
playin
at
this
proposal
a
thick
gloom
had
fallen
over
the
assembly
but
it
had
been
dispersed
by
serena
moody
cheerful
offer
to
have
the
small
melodion
brought
out
of
the
parlour
and
to
play
for
dancing
as
well
as
she
could
the
company
agreed
that
she
was
a
smart
girl
and
prepared
to
accept
her
performance
with
enthusiasm
as
the
dance
went
on
there
were
frequent
comments
of
approval
to
encourage
her
in
the
labour
of
love
doin
splendid
ai
she
said
the
other
girls
to
which
the
men
replied
bet
the
playin
reel
nice
and
good
fer
anybody
outside
o
city
but
serena
repertory
was
weak
though
her
spirit
was
willing
there
was
an
unspoken
sentiment
among
the
men
that
sweet
by
and
was
not
quite
the
best
tune
in
the
world
for
a
quadrille
a
hymn
no
matter
how
rapidly
it
was
rendered
seemed
to
fall
short
of
the
necessary
vivacity
for
a
polka
besides
the
wheezy
little
organ
positively
refused
to
go
faster
than
a
certain
gait
hose
ransom
expressed
the
popular
opinion
of
the
instrument
after
a
figure
in
which
he
and
his
partner
had
been
half
a
bar
ahead
of
the
music
from
start
to
finish
when
he
said
jolly
that
old
maloney
may
be
chock
full
o
relijun
and
but
it
ai
got
no
dance
into
it
no
more
a
this
was
the
situation
of
affairs
inside
of
moody
tavern
on
new
eve
but
outside
of
the
house
the
snow
lay
two
feet
deep
on
the
level
and
in
the
drifts
the
sky
was
at
last
swept
clean
of
clouds
the
shivering
stars
and
the
shrunken
moon
looked
infinitely
remote
in
the
black
vault
of
heaven
the
frozen
lake
on
which
the
ice
was
three
feet
thick
and
solid
as
rock
was
like
a
vast
smooth
bed
covered
with
a
white
counterpane
the
cruel
wind
still
poured
out
of
the
northwest
driving
the
dry
snow
along
with
it
like
a
mist
of
powdered
diamonds
enveloped
in
this
dazzling
pungent
atmosphere
half
blinded
and
bewildered
by
it
buffeted
and
yet
supported
by
the
onrushing
torrent
of
air
a
man
on
with
a
light
pack
on
his
shoulders
emerged
from
the
shelter
of
the
three
sisters
islands
and
staggered
straight
on
down
the
lake
he
passed
the
headland
of
the
bay
where
tavern
is
ensconced
and
probably
would
have
drifted
on
beyond
it
to
the
marsh
at
the
lower
end
of
the
lake
but
for
the
yellow
glare
of
the
windows
and
the
sound
of
music
and
dancing
which
came
out
to
him
suddenly
through
a
lull
in
the
wind
he
turned
to
the
right
climbed
over
the
low
wall
of
broken
that
bordered
the
lake
and
pushed
up
the
gentle
slope
to
the
open
passageway
by
which
the
two
parts
of
the
rambling
house
were
joined
together
crossing
the
porch
with
the
last
remnant
of
his
strength
he
lifted
his
hand
to
knock
and
fell
heavily
against
the
side
door
the
noise
heard
through
the
confusion
within
awakened
curiosity
and
conjecture
just
as
when
a
letter
comes
to
a
forest
cabin
it
is
turned
over
and
over
and
many
guesses
are
made
as
to
the
handwriting
and
the
authorship
before
it
occurs
to
any
one
to
open
it
and
see
who
sent
it
so
was
this
rude
knocking
at
the
gate
the
occasion
of
argument
among
the
rustic
revellers
as
to
what
it
might
portend
some
thought
it
was
the
arrival
of
the
belated
band
others
supposed
the
sound
betokened
a
descent
of
the
corey
clan
from
the
upper
lake
or
a
change
of
heart
on
the
part
of
old
dan
dunning
who
had
refused
to
attend
the
ball
because
they
would
not
allow
him
to
call
out
the
figures
the
guesses
were
various
but
no
one
thought
of
the
possible
arrival
of
a
stranger
at
such
an
hour
on
such
a
night
until
serena
suggested
that
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
open
the
door
then
the
unbidden
guest
was
discovered
lying
benumbed
along
the
threshold
there
was
no
want
of
knowledge
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
a
man
and
no
lack
of
ready
hands
to
do
it
they
carried
him
not
to
the
warm
stove
but
into
the
region
of
the
parlour
they
rubbed
his
face
and
his
hands
vigorously
with
snow
they
gave
him
a
drink
of
hot
tea
flavoured
with
whiskey
or
perhaps
it
was
a
drink
of
whiskey
with
a
little
hot
tea
in
it
and
then
as
his
senses
began
to
return
to
him
they
rolled
him
in
a
blanket
and
left
him
on
a
sofa
to
thaw
out
gradually
while
they
went
on
with
the
dance
naturally
he
was
the
favourite
subject
of
conversation
for
the
next
hour
is
he
anyhow
i
never
seen
before
where
he
come
from
asked
the
girls
dunno
said
bill
moody
did
say
much
talk
seemed
all
froze
up
frenchy
to
what
he
did
say
guess
he
must
a
come
from
canady
workin
on
a
lumber
job
up
raquette
river
way
got
bounced
out

all

this
summary
of
national
character
appeared
to
command
general
assent
said

ye
take
note
how
he
hung
on
to
that
pack
o
all
the
time
would
let
go

use

said
one
of
the
younger
boys
out
later
on
now
the
time
fer
dancin
whoop
up
so
the
sound
of
revelry
swept
on
again
in
full
flood
the
men
and
maids
went
careering
up
and
down
the
room
serena
willing
fingers
laboured
patiently
over
the
yellow
keys
of
the
reluctant
melodion
but
the
ancient
instrument
was
weakening
under
the
strain
the
bellows
creaked
the
notes
grew
more
and
more
asthmatic
the
was
the
tune
was
the
dance
and
it
was
a
preposterously
bad
fit
the
figure
was
tangled
up
like
a
after
trolling
all
day
without
a
swivel
the
dancers
were
doing
their
best
determined
to
be
happy
as
cheerful
as
possible
but
all
out
of
time
the
organ
was
whirring
and
gasping
and
groaning
for
breath
suddenly
a
new
music
filled
the
room
the
right
tune
the
real
old
joyful
musk
played
jubilantly
triumphantly
irresistibly
on
a
fiddle
the
melodion
gave
one
final
gasp
of
surprise
and
was
dumb
every
one
looked
up
there
in
the
parlour
door
stood
the
stranger
with
his
coat
off
his
violin
hugged
close
under
his
chin
his
right
arm
making
the
bow
fly
over
the
strings
his
black
eyes
sparkling
and
his
stockinged
feet
marking
time
to

a

to

woven
together
after
the
strangest
fashion
and
set
to
the
liveliest
cadence
it
was
a
magical
performance
no
one
could
withstand
it
they
all
danced
together
like
the
leaves
on
the
shivering
poplars
when
the
wind
blows
through
them
the
gentle
serena
was
swept
away
from
her
stool
at
the
organ
as
if
she
were
a
little
canoe
drawn
into
the
rapids
and
bill
moody
stepped
high
and
cut
that
had
been
forgotten
for
a
generation
it
was
long
after
midnight
when
the
dancers
paused
breathless
and
exhausted

breath

his
hand
passed
caressingly
over
the
smooth
brown
wood
of
the
violin
he
drew
it
up
close
to
his
face
again
as
if
he
would
have
kissed
it
while
his
eyes
wandered
timidly
around
the
circle
of
listeners
and
rested
at
last
with
a
question
in
them
on
the
face
of
the
moody
was
fairly
warmed
for
once
out
of
his
customary
temper
of
mistrust
and
indecision

spoke
up
promptly

way

to
have
a
lover
of
music
among
its
permanent
inhabitants
ii
jacques
dropped
into
his
place
and
filled
it
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
him
there
was
something
in
his
disposition
that
seemed
to
fit
him
for
just
the
role
that
was
vacant
in
the
social
drama
of
the
settlement
it
was
not
a
serious
important
responsible
part
like
that
of
a
farmer
or
a
or
a
professional
hunter
it
was
rather
an
addition
to
the
regular
programme
of
existence
something
unannounced
and
voluntary
and
therefore
not
weighted
with
too
heavy
responsibilities
there
was
a
touch
of
the
transient
and
uncertain
about
it
he
seemed
like
a
perpetual
visitor
and
yet
he
stayed
on
as
steadily
as
a
native
never
showing
from
the
first
the
slightest
wish
or
intention
to
leave
the
woodland
village
i
do
not
mean
that
he
was
an
idler
bytown
had
not
yet
arrived
at
that
stage
of
civilization
in
which
an
ornamental
element
is
supported
at
the
public
expense
he
worked
for
his
living
and
earned
it
he
was
full
of
a
quick
cheerful
industry
and
there
was
nothing
that
needed
to
be
done
about
moody
establishment
from
the
to
the
at
which
he
did
not
bear
a
hand
willingly
and
well
kin
work
like
a
beaver
said
bill
moody
talking
the
stranger
over
down
at
the
one
day
i
do
he
got
much
ambition
jess
does
his
work
and
takes
his
wages
and
then
gits
his
fiddle
out
and
ye
what
said
hose
ransom
who
set
up
for
the
village
philosopher
ai
got
no
that
what
makes
men
slack
he
do
know
what
it
means
to
rise
in
the
world
do
care
fer
anythin
ez
much
ez
he
does
fer
his
music
he
jess
like
a
bird
let
him
have
to
eat
and
a
chance
to
sing
and
he
all
right
he
about
a
house
of
his
own
and
a
barn
and
sich
things
hosea
illustration
was
suggested
by
his
own
experience
he
had
just
put
the
profits
of
his
last
summer
guiding
into
a
new
barn
and
his
imagination
was
already
at
work
planning
an
addition
to
his
house
in
the
shape
of
a
kitchen
but
in
spite
of
his
tone
of
contempt
he
had
a
kindly
feeling
for
the
unambitious
fiddler
indeed
this
was
the
attitude
of
pretty
much
every
one
in
the
community
a
few
men
of
the
rougher
sort
had
made
fun
of
him
at
first
and
there
had
been
one
or
two
attempts
at
rude
handling
but
jacques
was
determined
to
take
no
offence
and
he
was
so
so
obliging
so
pleasant
in
his
way
of
whistling
and
singing
about
his
work
that
all
unfriendliness
soon
died
out
he
had
literally
played
his
way
into
the
affections
of
the
village
the
winter
seemed
to
pass
more
swiftly
and
merrily
than
it
had
done
before
the
violin
was
there
he
was
always
ready
to
bring
it
out
and
draw
all
kinds
of
music
from
its
strings
as
long
as
any
one
wanted
to
listen
or
to
dance
it
made
no
difference
whether
there
was
a
roomful
of
listeners
or
only
a
couple
fiddlin
jack
was
just
as
glad
to
play
with
a
little
quiet
audience
he
loved
to
try
the
quaint
plaintive
airs
of
the
old
french
songs
la
claire
fontaine
canadien
errant
and
and
bits
of
simple
melody
from
the
great
composers
and
familiar
scotch
and
english
ballads
things
that
he
had
picked
up
heaven
knows
where
and
into
which
he
put
a
world
of
meaning
sad
and
sweet
he
was
at
his
best
in
this
vein
when
he
was
alone
with
serena
in
the
kitchen
she
with
a
piece
of
sewing
in
her
lap
sitting
beside
the
lamp
he
in
the
corner
by
the
stove
with
the
brown
violin
tucked
under
his
chin
wandering
on
from
one
air
to
another
and
perfectly
content
if
she
looked
up
now
and
then
from
her
work
and
told
him
that
she
liked
the
tune
serena
was
a
pretty
girl
with
smooth
silky
hair
end
eyes
of
the
colour
of
the
nodding
harebells
that
blossom
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
she
was
slight
and
delicate
the
neighbours
called
her
sickly
and
a
great
doctor
from
philadelphia
who
had
spent
a
summer
at
bytown
had
put
his
ear
to
her
chest
and
looked
grave
and
said
that
she
ought
to
winter
in
a
mild
climate
that
was
before
people
had
discovered
the
adirondacks
as
a
sanitarium
for
consumptives
but
the
inhabitants
of
bytown
were
not
in
the
way
of
paying
much
attention
to
the
theories
of
physicians
in
regard
to
climate
they
held
that
if
you
were
rugged
it
was
a
great
advantage
almost
a
virtue
but
if
you
were
sickly
you
just
had
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
get
along
with
the
weather
as
well
as
you
could
so
serena
stayed
at
home
and
adapted
herself
very
cheerfully
to
the
situation
she
kept
indoors
in
winter
more
than
the
other
girls
and
had
a
quieter
way
about
her
but
you
would
never
have
called
her
an
invalid
there
was
only
a
clearer
blue
in
her
eyes
and
a
smoother
lustre
on
her
brown
hair
and
a
brighter
spot
of
red
on
her
cheek
she
was
particularly
fond
of
reading
and
of
music
it
was
this
that
made
her
so
glad
of
the
arrival
of
the
violin
the
violin
master
knew
it
and
turned
to
her
as
a
sympathetic
soul
i
think
he
liked
her
eyes
too
and
the
soft
tones
of
her
voice
he
was
a
sentimentalist
this
little
canadian
for
all
he
was
so
merry
and
love
but
that
comes
later
you
get
your
fiddle
jack
said
serena
one
night
as
they
sat
together
in
the
kitchen
get
heem
in
kebeck
answered
jacques
passing
his
hand
lightly
over
the
instrument
as
he
always
did
when
any
one
spoke
of
it
nice
violon

you
jacques
one

said
serena
declining
to
commit
herself
but
pressing
on
gently
as
women
do
to
the
point
she
had
in
view
when
she
began
the
talk
you
any
more
foolish
than
a
man
that
keeps
on
what
he
do
like
but
what
made
you
come
away
from
the
boys
in
the
woods
and
travel
down
this
way
a
shade
passed
over
the
face
of
jacques
he
turned
away
from
the
lamp
and
bent
over
the
violin
on
his
knees
fingering
the
strings
nervously
then
he
spoke
in
a
changed
shaken
voice
tole
you
serene
you
ma
frien
don
you
me
dat
reason
of
it
no
more
dat
vair
bad
bad
bad
ah
ca
nevair
tole
dat
there
was
something
in
the
way
he
said
it
that
gave
a
check
to
her
gentle
curiosity
and
turned
it
into
pity
a
man
with
a
secret
in
his
life
it
was
a
new
element
in
her
experience
like
a
chapter
in
a
book
she
was
lady
enough
at
heart
to
respect
his
silence
she
kept
away
from
the
forbidden
ground
but
the
knowledge
that
it
was
there
gave
a
new
interest
to
jacques
and
his
music
she
embroidered
some
strange
romances
around
that
secret
while
she
sat
in
the
kitchen
sewing
other
people
at
bytown
were
less
forbearing
they
tried
their
best
to
find
out
something
about
fiddlin
jack
past
but
he
was
not
communicative
he
talked
about
canada
all
canadians
do
but
about
himself
no
if
the
questions
became
too
pressing
he
would
try
to
play
himself
away
from
his
inquisitors
with
new
tunes
if
that
did
not
succeed
he
would
take
the
violin
under
his
arm
and
slip
quickly
out
of
the
room
and
if
you
had
followed
him
at
such
a
time
you
would
have
heard
him
drawing
strange
melancholy
music
from
the
instrument
sitting
alone
in
the
barn
or
in
the
darkness
of
his
own
room
in
the
garret
once
and
only
once
he
seemed
to
come
near
betraying
himself
this
was
how
it
happened
there
was
a
party
at
moody
one
night
and
bull
corey
had
come
down
from
the
upper
lake
and
filled
himself
up
with
whiskey
bull
was
an
fellow
the
more
he
drank
up
to
a
certain
point
the
steadier
he
got
on
his
legs
and
the
more
necessary
it
seemed
for
him
to
fight
somebody
the
tide
of
his
pugnacity
that
night
took
a
straight
set
toward
fiddlin
jack
bull
began
with
musical
criticisms
the
fiddling
did
not
suit
him
at
all
it
was
too
quick
or
else
it
was
too
slow
he
failed
to
perceive
how
any
one
could
tolerate
such
music
even
in
the
infernal
regions
and
he
expressed
himself
in
plain
words
to
that
effect
in
fact
he
damned
the
performance
without
even
the
faintest
praise
but
the
majority
of
the
audience
gave
him
no
support
on
the
contrary
they
told
him
to
shut
up
and
jack
fiddled
along
cheerfully
then
bull
returned
to
the
attack
after
having
fortified
himself
in
the
and
now
he
took
national
grounds
the
french
were
in
his
opinion
a
most
despicable
race
they
were
not
a
patch
on
the
noble
american
race
they
talked
too
much
and
their
language
was
ridiculous
they
had
a
condemned
fool
habit
of
taking
off
their
hats
when
they
spoke
to
a
lady
they
ate
frogs
having
delivered
himself
of
these
sentiments
in
a
loud
voice
much
to
the
interruption
of
the
music
he
marched
over
to
the
table
on
which
fiddlin
jack
was
sitting
and
grabbed
the
violin
from
his
hands
gim
me
that
dam
fiddle
he
cried
i
see
if
there
a
frog
in
jacques
leaped
from
the
table
transported
with
rage
his
face
was
convulsed
his
eyes
blazed
he
snatched
a
from
the
dresser
behind
him
and
sprang
at
corey
dieu
he
shrieked
violon
ah
keel
you
beast
but
he
could
not
reach
the
enemy
bill
moody
long
arms
were
flung
around
the
struggling
fiddler
and
a
pair
of
brawny
guides
had
corey
pinned
by
the
elbows
hustling
him
backward
half
a
dozen
men
thrust
themselves
between
the
combatants
there
was
a
dead
silence
a
scuffling
of
feet
on
the
bare
floor
then
the
danger
was
past
and
a
tumult
of
talk
burst
forth
but
a
strange
alteration
had
passed
over
jacques
he
trembled
he
turned
white
tears
poured
down
his
cheeks
as
moody
let
him
go
he
dropped
on
his
knees
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
prayed
in
his
own
tongue
god
it
is
here
again
was
it
not
enough
that
i
must
be
tempted
once
before
must
i
have
the
madness
yet
another
time
my
god
show
the
mercy
toward
me
for
the
blessed
virgin
sake
i
am
a
sinner
but
not
the
second
time
for
the
love
of
jesus
not
the
second
time
ave
maria
gratia
plena
ora
pro
me
the
others
did
not
understand
what
he
was
saying
indeed
they
paid
little
attention
to
him
they
saw
he
was
frightened
and
thought
it
was
with
fear
they
were
already
discussing
what
ought
to
be
done
about
the
fracas
it
was
plain
that
bull
corey
whose
liquor
had
now
taken
effect
suddenly
and
made
him
as
limp
as
a
strip
of
cedar
bark
must
be
thrown
out
of
the
door
and
left
to
cool
off
on
the
beach
but
what
to
do
with
fiddlin
jack
for
his
attempt
at
knifing
a
detested
crime
he
might
have
gone
at
bull
with
a
gun
or
with
a
club
or
with
a
chair
or
with
any
recognized
weapon
but
with
a
that
was
a
serious
offence
arrest
him
and
send
him
to
jail
at
the
forks
take
him
out
and
duck
him
in
the
lake
lick
him
and
drive
him
out
of
the
town
there
was
a
multitude
of
counsellors
but
it
was
hose
ransom
who
settled
the
case
he
was
a
and
a
respected
philosopher
he
swung
his
broad
frame
in
front
of
the
fiddler
ye
what
we
do
jess
nothin
ai
bull
corey
the
and
the
mos
cuss
these
hull
woods
and
would
it
be
a
thing
ef
some
o
the
wind
was
let
out
him
general
assent
greeted
this
pointed
inquiry
fiddlin
jack
peacerble
long
he
was
let
alone
what
the
matter
with
lettin
him
alone
now
the
argument
seemed
to
carry
weight
hose
saw
his
advantage
and
clinched
it
he
given
us
a
lot
o
fun
here
this
winter
in
a
innercent
kind
way
with
his
old
fiddle
i
guess
there
ai
nothin
on
airth
he
loves
better
that
holler
piece
o
wood
and
the
toons
that
inside
o
it
it
jess
like
a
wife
or
a
child
to
him
where
that
fiddle
anyhow
some
one
had
picked
it
deftly
out
of
corey
hand
during
the
scuffle
and
now
passed
it
up
to
hose
frenchy
take
yer
and
i
want
you
boys
to
understand
ef
any
one
teches
that
fiddle
knock
hell
out
so
the
recording
angel
dropped
another
tear
upon
the
record
of
hosea
ransom
and
the
books
were
closed
for
the
night
iii
for
some
weeks
after
the
incident
of
the
violin
and
the
it
looked
as
if
a
permanent
cloud
had
settled
upon
the
spirits
of
fiddlin
jack
he
was
sad
and
nervous
if
any
one
touched
him
or
even
spoke
to
him
suddenly
he
would
jump
like
a
deer
he
kept
out
of
everybody
way
as
much
as
possible
sat
out
in
the
when
he
was
not
at
work
and
could
not
be
persuaded
to
bring
down
his
fiddle
he
seemed
in
a
fair
way
to
be
transformed
into
melancholy
it
was
serena
who
broke
the
spell
and
she
did
it
in
a
woman
way
the
simplest
way
in
the
world
by
taking
no
notice
of
it
you
goin
to
play
for
me
she
asked
one
evening
as
jacques
passed
through
the
kitchen
whereupon
the
evil
spirit
was
exorcised
and
the
violin
came
back
again
to
its
place
in
the
life
of
the
house
but
there
was
less
time
for
music
now
than
there
had
been
in
the
winter
as
the
snow
vanished
from
the
woods
and
the
frost
leaked
out
of
the
ground
and
the
ice
on
the
lake
was
honeycombed
breaking
away
from
the
shore
and
finally
going
to
pieces
altogether
in
a
warm
southeast
storm
the
sportsmen
retreat
began
to
prepare
for
business
there
was
a
garden
to
be
planted
and
there
were
boats
to
be
painted
the
rotten
old
wharf
in
front
of
the
house
stood
badly
in
need
of
repairs
the
fiddler
proved
himself
a
and
master
of
more
than
one
in
the
middle
of
may
the
anglers
began
to
arrive
at
the
retreat
a
quiet
sociable
friendly
set
of
men
most
of
whom
were
acquaintances
and
familiar
lovers
of
the
woods
they
belonged
to
the
adirondack
period
these
disciples
of
walton
they
were
not
very
rich
and
they
did
not
put
on
much
style
but
they
understood
how
to
have
a
good
time
and
what
they
did
not
know
about
fishing
was
not
worth
knowing
jacques
fitted
into
their
scheme
of
life
as
a
reel
fits
the
butt
of
a
good
rod
he
was
a
steady
oarsman
a
lucky
fisherman
with
a
real
genius
for
the
use
of
the
and
a
cheerful
companion
who
did
not
insist
upon
giving
his
views
about
artificial
flies
and
advice
about
casting
on
every
occasion
by
the
end
of
june
he
found
himself
in
steady
employment
as
a
guide
he
liked
best
to
go
with
the
anglers
who
were
not
too
energetic
but
were
satisfied
to
fish
for
a
few
hours
in
the
morning
and
again
at
sunset
after
a
long
rest
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
this
was
just
the
time
for
the
violin
and
if
jacques
had
his
way
he
would
take
it
with
him
carefully
tucked
away
in
its
case
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
when
the
pipes
were
lit
after
lunch
on
the
shore
of
round
island
or
at
the
mouth
of
cold
brook
he
would

sweet

until
the
declining
sun
drew
near
the
and
the
veery
rang
his
silver
bell
for

then
it
was
time
to
fish
again
and
the
flies
danced
merrily
over
the
water
and
the
great
speckled
trout
leaped
eagerly
to
catch
them

brought
a

of
guests
to
the
retreat
and
filled
the
ramshackle
old
house
to
overflowing
the
fishing
fell
off
but
there
were
picnics
and
in
abundance
and
jacques
was
in
demand
the
ladies
liked
him
his
manners
were
so
pleasant
and
they
took
a
great
interest
in
his
music
moody
bought
a
piano
for
the
parlour
that
summer
and
there
were
two
or
three
good
players
in
the
house
to
whom
jacques
would
listen
with
delight
sitting
on
a
pile
of
logs
outside
the
parlour
windows
in
the
warm
august
evenings
some
one
asked
him
whether
he
did
not
prefer
the
piano
to
the
violin
he
answered
very
decidedly

through
all
the
occupations
and
pleasures
of
the
summer
jacques
kept
as
near
as
he
could
to
serena
if
he
learned
a
new
tune
by
listening
to
the
piano
some
simple
artful
air
of
mozart
some
melancholy
echo
of
a
nocturne
of
chopin
some
tender
passionate
of
schubert
it
was
to
her
that
he
would
play
it
first
if
he
could
persuade
her
to
a
with
him
on
the
lake
sunday
evening
the
week
was
complete
he
even
learned
to
know
the
more
shy
and
delicate
that
she
preferred
and
would
come
in
from
a
day
guiding
with
a
tiny
bunch
of
belated
or
a
few
orchids
or
a
handful
of
nodding
stalks
of
the
fragrant
pyrola
for
her
so
the
summer
passed
and
the
autumn
with
its
longer
hunting
expeditions
into
the
depth
of
the
wilderness
and
by
the
time
winter
came
around
again
fiddlin
jack
was
well
settled
at
moody
as
a
regular
adirondack
guide
of
the
type
but
with
a
difference
he
improved
in
his
english
something
of
that
missing
quality
which
moody
called
ambition
and
to
which
hose
ransom
gave
the
name
of
imagination
seemed
to
awaken
within
him
he
saved
his
wages
he
went
into
business
for
himself
in
a
modest
way
and
made
a
good
turn
in
the
manufacture
of
deerskin
mittens
and
by
the
spring
he
had
nearly
three
hundred
dollars
laid
by
and
bought
a
piece
of
land
from
ransom
on
the
bank
of
the
river
just
above
the
village
the
second
summer
of
guiding
brought
him
in
enough
to
commence
building
a
little
house
it
was
of
logs
neatly
squared
at
the
corners
and
there
was
a
door
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
facade
with
a
square
window
at
either
side
and
another
at
each
end
of
the
house
according
to
the
common
style
of
architecture
at
bytown
but
it
was
in
the
roof
that
the
touch
of
distinction
appeared
for
this
jacques
had
modelled
after
his
memory
of
an
old
canadian
roof
there
was
a
delicate
concave
sweep
in
it
as
it
sloped
downward
from
the
peak
and
the
eaves
projected
pleasantly
over
the
front
door
making
a
strip
of
shade
wherein
it
would
be
good
to
rest
when
the
afternoon
sun
shone
hot
he
took
great
pride
in
this
effort
of
the
builder
art
one
day
at
the
beginning
of
may
when
the
house
was
nearly
finished
he
asked
old
moody
and
serena
to
stop
on
their
way
home
from
the
village
and
see
what
he
had
done
he
showed
them
the
kitchen
and
the
with
the
partitioned
off
from
it
and
sharing
half
of
its
side
window
here
was
a
place
where
a
door
could
be
cut
at
the
back
and
a
shed
built
for
a
summer
kitchen
for
the
coolness
you
understand
and
here
were
two
stoves
one
for
the
cooking
and
the
other
in
the
for
the
warming
both
of
the
newest
look

thus
the
imagination
of
jacques
unfolded
itself
and
his
ambition
appeared
to
be
making
plans
for
its
accomplishment
i
do
not
want
any
one
to
suppose
that
there
was
a
crisis
in
his
affair
of
the
heart
there
was
none
indeed
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
anybody
in
the
village
even
serena
herself
ever
dreamed
that
there
was
such
an
affair
up
to
the
point
when
the
house
was
finished
and
furnished
it
was
to
be
a
secret
between
jacques
and
his
violin
and
they
found
no
difficulty
in
keeping
it
bytown
was
a
yankee
village
jacques
was
after
all
nothing
but
a
frenchman
the
native
tone
of
religion
what
there
was
of
it
was
strongly
methodist
jacques
never
went
to
church
and
if
he
was
anything
was
probably
a
roman
catholic
serena
was
something
of
a
sentimentalist
and
a
great
reader
of
novels
but
the
international
had
not
yet
been
invented
and
the
idea
of
getting
married
to
a
foreigner
never
entered
her
head
i
do
not
say
that
she
suspected
nothing
in
the
wild
flowers
and
the
sunday
evening
and
the
music
she
was
a
woman
i
have
said
already
that
she
liked
jacques
very
much
and
his
violin
pleased
her
to
the
heart
but
the
new
building
by
the
river
i
am
sure
she
never
even
thought
of
it
once
in
the
way
that
he
did
well
in
the
end
of
june
just
after
the
furniture
had
come
for
the
house
with
the
curved
roof
serena
was
married
to
hose
ransom
he
was
a
young
widower
without
children
and
altogether
the
best
fellow
as
well
as
the
most
prosperous
in
the
settlement
his
house
stood
up
on
the
hill
across
the
road
from
the
lot
which
jacques
had
bought
it
was
painted
white
and
it
had
a
narrow
front
porch
with
a
fringe
around
the
edge
of
it
and
there
was
a
little
garden
fenced
in
with
white
palings
in
which
sweet
williams
and
pansies
and
blue
lupines
and
pink
were
planted
the
wedding
was
at
the
sportsmen
retreat
and
jacques
was
there
of
course
there
was
nothing
of
the
disconsolate
lover
about
him
the
noun
he
might
have
confessed
to
in
a
confidential
moment
of
intercourse
with
his
violin
but
the
adjective
was
not
in
his
line
the
strongest
impulse
in
his
nature
was
to
be
a
giver
of
entertaininent
a
source
of
joy
in
others
a
recognized
element
of
delight
in
the
little
world
where
he
moved
he
had
the
artistic
temperament
in
its
most
primitive
and
naive
form
nothing
pleased
him
so
much
as
the
act
of
pleasing
music
was
the
means
which
nature
had
given
him
to
fulfil
this
desire
he
played
as
you
might
say
out
of
a
certain
kind
of
selfishness
because
he
enjoyed
making
other
people
happy
he
was
selfish
enough
in
his
way
to
want
the
pleasure
of
making
everybody
feel
the
same
delight
that
he
felt
in
the
clear
tones
the
merry
cadences
the
tender
and
caressing
flow
of
his
violin
that
was
consolation
that
was
power
that
was
success
and
especially
was
he
selfish
enough
to
want
to
feel
his
ability
to
give
serena
a
pleasure
at
her
wedding
a
pleasure
that
nobody
else
could
give
her
when
she
asked
him
to
play
he
consented
gladly
never
had
he
drawn
the
bow
across
the
strings
with
a
more
magical
touch
the
wedding
guests
danced
as
if
they
were
enchanted
the
big
bridegroom
came
up
and
clapped
him
on
the
back
with
the
nearest
approach
to
a
gesture
of
affection
that
backwoods
etiquette
allows
between
men
you
the
boss
fiddler
o
this
hull
county
have
a
drink
now
i
guess
you
mighty
non
said
jacques
drink
only

dis
night
eef
i
drink
two
i
get
in
between
the
dances
and
while
the
supper
was
going
on
he
played
quieter
tunes
ballads
and
songs
that
he
knew
serena
liked
after
supper
came
the
final
reel
and
when
that
was
wound
up
with
immense
hilarity
the
company
ran
out
to
the
side
door
of
the
tavern
to
shout
a
noisy
farewell
to
the
bridal
buggy
as
it
drove
down
the
road
toward
the
house
with
the
white
palings
when
they
came
back
the
fiddler
was
gone
he
had
slipped
away
to
the
little
cabin
with
the
curved
roof
all
night
long
he
sat
there
playing
in
the
dark
every
tune
that
he
had
ever
known
came
back
to
him
grave
and
merry
light
and
sad
he
played
them
over
and
over
again
passing
round
and
round
among
them
as
a
leaf
on
a
stream
follows
the
eddies
now
backward
now
forward
and
returning
most
frequently
to
an
echo
of
a
certain
theme
from
chopin
you
remember
the
nocturne
in
g
minor
the
second
one
he
did
not
know
who
chopin
was
perhaps
he
did
not
even
know
the
name
of
the
music
but
the
air
had
fallen
upon
his
ear
somewhere
and
had
stayed
in
his
memory
and
now
it
seemed
to
say
something
to
him
that
had
an
especial
meaning
at
last
he
let
the
bow
fall
he
patted
the
brown
wood
of
the
violin
after
his
old
fashion
loosened
the
strings
a
little
wrapped
it
in
its
green
baize
cover
and
hung
it
on
the
wall
thou
there
thou
little
violin
he
murmured
is
now
that
i
shall
take
the
good
care
of
thee
as
never
before
for
thou
art
the
wife
of
jacques
tremblay
and
the
wife
of
ransom
she
is
a
friend
to
us
both
of
us
and
we
will
make
the
music
for
her
many
years
i
tell
thee
many
years
for
her
and
for
her
good
man
and
for
the
children
yes
but
serena
did
not
have
many
years
to
listen
to
the
playing
of
jacques
tremblay
on
the
white
porch
in
the
summer
evenings
with
abloom
in
the
garden
or
by
the
winter
fire
while
the
pale
blue
moonlight
lay
on
the
snow
without
and
the
yellow
lamplight
filled
the
room
with
homely
radiance
in
the
fourth
year
after
her
marriage
she
died
and
jacques
stood
beside
hose
at
the
funeral
there
was
a
child
a
little
boy
delicate
and
the
living
image
of
his
mother
jacques
appointed
himself
general
attendant
nurse
in
extraordinary
and
court
musician
to
this
child
he
gave
up
his
work
as
a
guide
it
took
him
too
much
away
from
home
he
was
tired
of
it
besides
what
did
he
want
of
so
much
money
he
had
his
house
he
could
gain
enough
for
all
his
needs
by
making
and
the
deerskin
mittens
at
home
then
he
could
be
near
little
billy
it
was
pleasanter
so
when
hose
was
away
on
a
long
trip
in
the
woods
jacques
would
move
up
to
the
white
house
and
stay
on
guard
his
fiddle
learned
how
to
sing
the
prettiest
slumber
songs
moreover
it
could
crow
in
the
morning
just
like
the
cock
and
it
could
make
a
noise
like
a
mouse
and
like
the
cat
too
and
there
were
more
tunes
inside
of
it
than
in
any
in
the
world
as
the
boy
grew
older
the
little
cabin
with
the
curved
roof
became
his
favourite
playground
it
was
near
the
river
and
fiddlin
jack
was
always
ready
to
make
a
boat
for
him
or
help
him
catch
minnows
in
the
the
child
had
a
taste
for
music
too
and
learned
some
of
the
old
canadian
songs
which
he
sang
in
a
curious
broken
patois
while
his
delighted
teacher
accompanied
him
on
the
violin
but
it
was
a
great
day
when
he
was
eight
years
old
and
jacques
brought
out
a
small
fiddle
for
which
he
had
secretly
sent
to
albany
and
presented
it
to
the
boy
see

dis

then
he
drew
the
bow
across
the
strings
and
dashed
into
a
medley
of
the
jolliest
airs
imaginable
the
boy
took
to
his
instruction
as
kindly
as
could
have
been
expected
school
interrupted
it
a
good
deal
and
play
with
the
other
boys
carried
him
away
often
but
after
all
there
was
nothing
that
he
liked
much
better
than
to
sit
in
the
little
cabin
on
a
winter
evening
and
pick
out
a
simple
tune
after
his
teacher
he
must
have
had
some
talent
for
it
too
for
jacques
was
very
proud
of
his
pupil
and
prophesied
great
things
of
him
know

the
fiddler
would

iv
thirty
years
brought
many
changes
to
bytown
the
wild
woodland
flavour
evaporated
out
of
the
place
almost
entirely
and
instead
of
an
independent
centre
of
rustic
life
it
became
an
annex
to
great
cities
it
was
exploited
as
a
summer
resort
and
discovered
as
a
winter
resort
three
or
four
big
hotels
were
planted
there
and
in
their
shadow
a
score
of
alternately
languished
and
flourished
the
summer
cottage
also
appeared
and
multiplied
and
with
it
came
many
of
the
peculiar
features
which
man
elaborates
in
his
struggle
toward
the
finest
civilization
afternoon
teas
and
amateur
theatricals
and
coats
and
a
casino
and
even
a
few
servants
in
livery
the
very
name
of
bytown
was
discarded
as
being
too
american
and
commonplace
an
indian
name
was
discovered
and
considered
much
more
romantic
and
appropriate
you
will
look
in
vain
for
bytown
on
the
map
now
nor
will
you
find
the
old
there
any
longer
wasting
a
vast
to
turn
its
dripping
wheel
and
cut
up
a
few
into
fragrant
boards
there
is
a
big
a
little
farther
up
the
river
which
rips
out
thousands
of
feet
of
lumber
in
a
day
but
there
are
no
more
only
sticks
of
spruce
which
the
old
lumbermen
would
have
thought
hardly
worth
cutting
and
down
below
the
dam
there
is
a
to
chew
up
the
little
trees
and
turn
them
into
paper
and
a
chair
factory
and
two
or
three
industrial
establishments
with
quite
a
little
colony
of
employed
in
them
as
workmen
hose
ransom
sold
his
place
on
the
hill
to
one
of
the
hotel
companies
and
a
huge
caravansary
occupied
the
site
of
the
house
with
the
white
palings
there
were
no
more
in
the
garden
there
were
beds
of
flaring
red
geraniums
which
looked
as
if
they
were
painted
and
across
the
circle
of
smooth
lawn
in

of
the
piazza
the
name
of

was
printed
in
alleged
ornamental

immensely
ugly

been
elevated
to
the
office
of

and
lived
in

street
little
billy

had
grown
up
into
a
very
interesting
young
man
with
a
decided
musical
genius
and
a
tenor
voice
which
being
discovered
by
an
enterprising
patron
of
genius
from
boston
billy
was
sent
away
to

to
learn
to
sing

day
you
will
hear
of
his
debut
in

house
with

he
was
still
the
favourite
musician
of
the
in
great
request
at
parties
and
weddings
but
he
had
extended
the
sphere
of
his
influence
a
little
he
was
not
willing
to
go
to
church
though
there
were
now
several
to
choose
from
but
a
young
minister
of
liberal
views
who
had
come
to
take
charge
of
the
new
episcopal
chapel
had
persuaded
jacques
into
the
to
lead
the
children
singing
with
his
violin
he
did
it
so
well
that
the
school
became
the
most
popular
in
the
village
it
was
much
pleasanter
to
sing
than
to
listen
to
long
addresses
jacques
grew
old
gracefully
but
he
certainly
grew
old
rapidly
his
beard
was
white
his
shoulders
were
stooping
he
suffered
a
good
deal
in
damp
days
from
rheumatism
fortunately
not
in
his
hands
but
in
his
legs
one
spring
there
was
a
long
spell
of
abominable
weather
just
between
freezing
and
thawing
he
caught
a
heavy
cold
and
took
to
his
bed
hose
came
over
to
look
after
him
for
a
few
days
the
old
fiddler
kept
up
his
courage
and
would
sit
up
in
the
bed
trying
to
play
then
his
strength
and
his
spirit
seemed
to
fail
together
he
grew
silent
and
indifferent
when
hose
came
in
he
would
find
jacques
with
his
face
turned
to
the
wall
where
there
was
a
tiny
brass
crucifix
hanging
below
the
violin
and
his
lips
moving
quietly
ye
want
the
fiddle
jack
i
like
ter
hear
some
o
them
tunes
but
the
artifice
failed
jacques
shook
his
head
his
mind
seemed
to
turn
back
to
the
time
of
his
first
arrival
in
the
village
and
beyond
it
when
he
spoke
at
all
it
was
of
something
connected
with
this
early
time
was
bad
taim
when
i
near

corey

nodded
gravely
was

dat
night
when
i
come
to

you
remember
dat
yes
hose
remembered
it
very
well
it
was
a
real
storm
but
befo
dose
taim
dere
was
wuss
taim
dan
dat
in
canada
nobody
don
know
dat
i
lak
to
tell
you
but
i
ca
no
it
is
not
possible
to
tell
dat
nevair
it
came
into
hose
mind
that
the
case
was
serious
jack
was
going
to
die
he
never
went
to
church
but
perhaps
the
might
count
for
something
he
was
only
a
frenchman
after
all
and
frenchmen
had
their
own
ways
of
doing
things
he
certainly
ought
to
see
some
kind
of
a
preacher
before
he
went
out
of
the
wilderness
there
was
a
canadian
priest
in
town
that
week
who
had
come
down
to
see
about
getting
up
a
church
for
the
french
people
who
worked
in
the
mills
perhaps
jack
would
like
to
talk
with
him
his
face
lighted
up
at
the
proposal
he
asked
to
have
the
room
tidied
up
and
a
clean
shirt
put
on
him
and
the
violin
laid
open
in
its
case
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
and
a
few
other
preparations
made
for
the
visit
then
the
visitor
came
a
tall
friendly
man
about
jacques
age
with
a
smooth
face
and
a
long
black
cassock
the
door
was
shut
and
they
were
left
alone
together
am
comforted
that
you
are
come
mon
pere
said
the
sick
man
i
have
the
heavy
heart
there
is
a
secret
that
i
have
kept
for
many
years
sometimes
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
it
must
be
told
at
the
last
but
now
it
is
the
time
to
speak
i
have
a
sin
to
confess
a
sin
of
the
most
grievous
of
the
most
the
listener
soothed
him
with
gracious
words
spoke
of
the
mercy
that
waits
for
all
the
penitent
urged
him
to
open
his
heart
without
delay
then
mon
pere
it
is
this
that
makes
me
fear
to
die
long
since
in
canada
before
i
came
to
this
place
i
have
killed
a
man
it
was
the
voice
stopped
the
little
round
clock
on
the
ticked
very
distinctly
and
rapidly
as
if
it
were
in
a
hurry
will
speak
as
short
as
i
can
it
was
in
the
camp
of
gautier
on
the
river
maurice
the
big
baptiste
lacombe
that
crazy
boy
who
wants
always
to
fight
he
mocks
me
when
i
play
he
snatches
my
violin
he
goes
to
break
him
on
the
stove
there
is
a
knife
in
my
belt
i
spring
to
baptiste
i
see
no
more
what
it
is
that
i
do
i
cut
him
in
the
neck
once
twice
the
blood
flies
out
he
falls
down
he
cries
die
i
grab
my
violin
from
the
floor
quick
then
i
run
to
the
woods
no
one
can
catch
me
a
blanket
the
axe
some
food
i
get
from
a
down
the
river
then
i
travel
travel
travel
through
the
woods
how
many
days
i
know
not
till
i
come
here
no
one
knows
me
i
give
myself
the
name
tremblay
i
make
the
music
for
them
with
my
violin
i
live
i
am
happy
i
forget
but
it
all
returns
to
me
now
at
the
last
i
have
murdered
is
there
a
forgiveness
for
me
mon
pere
the
priest
face
had
changed
very
swiftly
at
the
mention
of
the
camp
on
the
maurice
as
the
story
went
on
he
grew
strangely
excited
his
lips
twitched
his
hands
trembled
at
the
end
he
sank
on
his
knees
close
by
the
bed
and
looked
into
the
countenance
of
the
sick
man
searching
it
as
a
forester
searches
in
the
undergrowth
for
a
lost
trail
then
his
eyes
lighted
up
as
he
found
it
son
said
he
clasping
the
old
fiddler
hand
in
his
own
are
jacques
dellaire
and
i
do
you
know
me
now
i
am
baptiste
lacombe
see
those
two
scars
upon
my
neck
but
it
was
not
death
you
have
not
murdered
you
have
given
the
stroke
that
changed
my
heart
your
sin
is
forgiven
and
mine
also
by
the
mercy
of
god
the
round
clock
ticked
louder
and
louder
a
level
ray
from
the
setting
sun
red
gold
came
in
through
the
dusty
window
and
lay
across
the
clasped
hands
on
the
bed
a
sparrow
the
first
of
the
season
on
his
way
to
the
woods
beyond
the
lawrence
whistled
so
clearly
and
tenderly
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
repeating
to
these
two
exiles
the
name
of
their
homeland
sweet
canada
canada
canada
but
there
was
a
sweeter
sound
than
that
in
the
quiet
room
it
was
the
sound
of
the
prayer
which
begins
in
every
language
spoken
by
men
with
the
name
of
that
unseen
one
who
rules
over
life
chances
and
pities
its
discords
and
tunes
it
back
again
into
harmony
yes
this
prayer
of
the
little
children
who
are
only
learning
how
to
play
the
first
notes
of
life
music
turns
to
the
great
master
musician
who
knows
it
all
and
who
loves
to
bring
a
melody
out
of
every
instrument
that
he
has
made
and
it
seems
to
lay
the
soul
in
his
hands
to
play
upon
as
he
will
while
it
calls
him
our
father
some
day
perhaps
you
will
go
to
the
busy
place
where
bytown
used
to
be
and
if
you
do
you
must
take
the
street
by
the
river
to
the
white
wooden
church
of
jacques
it
stands
on
the
very
spot
where
there
was
once
a
cabin
with
a
curved
roof
there
is
a
gilt
cross
on
the
top
of
the
church
the
door
is
usually
open
and
the
interior
is
quite
gay
with
vases
of
china
and
brass
and
paper
flowers
of
many
colours
but
if
you
go
through
to
the
sacristy
at
the
rear
you
will
see
a
brown
violin
hanging
on
the
wall
pere
baptiste
if
he
is
there
will
take
it
down
and
show
it
to
you
he
calls
it
a
remarkable
instrument
one
of
the
best
of
the
most
sweet
but
he
will
not
let
any
one
play
upon
it
he
says
it
is
a
relic
ii
the
reward
of
virtue
i
when
the
good
priest
of
gerome
christened
patrick
mullarkey
he
lent
himself
unconsciously
to
an
innocent
deception
to
look
at
the
name
you
would
think
of
course
it
belonged
to
an
irishman
the
very
appearance
of
it
was
equal
to
a
certificate
of
membership
in
a
fenian
society
but
in
effect
from
the
toes
of
his
bottes
sauvages
to
the
ends
of
his
black
mustache
the
proprietor
of
this
name
was
a
frenchman
canadian
french
you
understand
and
therefore
even
more
proud
and
tenacious
of
his
race
than
if
he
had
been
born
in
normandy
somewhere
in
his
family
tree
there
must
have
been
a
graft
from
the
green
isle
a
wandering
lumberman
from
county
kerry
had
drifted
up
the
saguenay
into
the
lake
john
region
and
married
the
daughter
of
a
habitant
and
settled
down
to
forget
his
own
country
and
his
house
but
every
visible
trace
of
this
infusion
of
new
blood
had
vanished
long
ago
except
the
name
and
the
name
itself
was
transformed
on
the
lips
of
the
geromians
if
you
had
heard
them
speak
it
in
their
pleasant
droning
accent
moullarque
you
would
have
supposed
that
it
was
made
in
france
to
have
a
guide
with
such
a
name
as
that
was
as
good
as
being
abroad
even
when
they
cut
it
short
and
called
him
as
they
usually
did
it
had
a
very
foreign
sound
everything
about
him
was
in
harmony
with
it
he
spoke
and
laughed
and
sang
and
thought
and
felt
in
french
the
french
of
two
hundred
years
ago
the
language
of
samuel
de
champlain
and
the
sieur
de
monts
touched
with
a
strong
woodland
flavour
in
short
my
guide
philosopher
and
friend
pat
did
not
have
a
drop
of
irish
in
him
unless
perhaps
it
was
a
certain
well
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
when
you
have
heard
this
story
of
his
virtue
and
the
way
it
was
rewarded
it
was
on
the
shore
of
the
lac
a
la
belle
riviere
fifteen
miles
back
from
gerome
that
i
came
into
the
story
and
found
myself
as
commonly
happens
in
the
real
stories
which
life
is
always
bringing
out
in
periodical
form
somewhere
about
the
middle
of
the
plot
but
patrick
readily
made
me
acquainted
with
what
had
gone
before
indeed
it
is
one
of
life
greatest
charms
as
a
that
there
is
never
any
trouble
about
getting
a
brief
resume
of
the
argument
and
even
a
listener
who
arrives
late
is
soon
put
into
touch
with
the
course
of
the
narrative
we
had
hauled
our
canoes
and
over
the
terrible
road
that
leads
to
the
lake
with
much
creaking
and
groaning
of
wagons
and
complaining
of
men
who
declared
that
the
mud
grew
deeper
and
the
hills
steeper
every
year
and
vowed
their
customary
vow
never
to
come
that
way
again
at
last
our
tents
were
pitched
in
a
green
copse
of
balsam
trees
close
beside
the
water
the
delightful
sense
of
peace
and
freedom
descended
upon
our
souls
prosper
and
ovide
were
cutting
wood
for
the
francois
was
getting
ready
a
brace
of
partridges
for
supper
patrick
and
i
were
unpacking
the
provisions
arranging
them
conveniently
for
present
use
and
future
transportation
pat
said
i
as
my
hand
fell
on
a
large
square
parcel
is
some
superfine
tobacco
that
i
got
in
quebec
for
you
and
the
other
men
on
this
trip
not
like
the
damp
stuff
you
had
last
year
a
little
bad
smoke
and
too
many
bad
words
this
is
tobacco
to
burn
something
quite
particular
you
understand
how
does
that
please
you
he
had
been
rolling
up
a
piece
of
salt
pork
in
a
cloth
as
i
spoke
and
courteously
wiped
his
fingers
on
the
outside
of
the
bundle
before
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
the
package
of
tobacco
then
he
answered
with
his
unfailing
politeness
but
more
solemnly
than
usual
thousand
thanks
to
but
this
year
i
shall
not
have
need
of
the
good
tobacco
it
shall
be
for
the
the
reply
was
so
unexpected
that
it
almost
took
my
breath
away
for
pat
the
steady
smoker
whose
pipes
were
as
invariable
as
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
to
refuse
his
regular
rations
of
the
soothing
weed
was
a
thing
unheard
of
could
he
be
growing
proud
in
his
old
age
had
he
some
secret
supply
of
cigars
concealed
in
his
kit
which
made
him
scorn
the
golden
virginia
leaf
i
demanded
an
explanation
no
he
replied
is
not
that
most
assuredly
it
is
something
entirely
different
something
very
serious
it
is
a
reformation
that
i
commence
does
permit
that
i
should
inform
him
of
it
of
course
i
permitted
or
rather
warmly
encouraged
the
fullest
possible
unfolding
of
the
tale
and
while
we
sat
among
the
bags
and
boxes
and
the
sun
settled
gently
down
behind
the
firs
across
the
lake
and
the
evening
sky
and
the
waveless
lake
glowed
with
a
thousand
tints
of
deepening
rose
and
amber
patrick
put
me
in
possession
of
the
facts
which
had
led
to
a
moral
revolution
in
his
life
was
the
meelair
that
young
lady
not
very
young
but
active
like
the
youngest
the
one
that
i
conducted
down
the
grande
decharge
to
chicoutimi
last
year
after
you
had
gone
away
she
said
that
she
knew
intimately
no
doubt
you
have
a
good
remembrance
of
her
i
admitted
an
acquaintance
with
the
lady
she
was
the
president
of
several
societies
for
ethical
agitation
a
long
woman
with
short
hair
and
eyeglasses
and
a
great
thirst
for
tea
not
very
good
in
a
canoe
but
always
wanting
to
run
the
rapids
and
go
into
the
dangerous
places
and
talking
all
the
time
yes
that
must
have
been
the
one
she
was
not
a
bosom
friend
of
mine
to
speak
accurately
but
i
remembered
her
well
then
continued
patrick
was
this
demoiselle
who
changed
my
mind
about
the
smoking
but
not
in
a
moment
you
understand
it
was
a
work
of
four
days
and
she
spoke
much
first
day
it
was
at
the
island
house
we
were
trolling
for
ouananiche
and
she
was
not
pleased
for
she
lost
many
of
the
fish
i
was
smoking
at
the
stern
of
the
canoe
and
she
said
that
the
tobacco
was
a
filthy
weed
that
it
grew
in
the
devil
garden
and
that
it
smelled
bad
terribly
bad
and
that
it
made
the
air
sick
and
that
even
the
pig
would
not
eat
i
could
imagine
patrick
dismay
as
he
listened
to
this
dissertation
for
in
his
way
he
was
as
sensitive
as
a
woman
and
he
would
rather
have
been
upset
in
his
canoe
than
have
exposed
himself
to
the
reproach
of
offending
any
one
of
his
patrons
by
unpleasant
or
unseemly
conduct
did
you
do
then
pat
i
asked
i
put
out
the
pipe
what
could
i
do
otherwise
but
i
thought
that
what
the
demoiselle
meelair
has
said
was
very
strange
and
not
true
exactly
for
i
have
often
seen
the
tobacco
grow
and
it
springs
up
out
of
the
ground
like
the
wheat
or
the
beans
and
it
has
beautiful
leaves
broad
and
green
with
sometimes
a
red
flower
at
the
top
does
the
good
god
cause
the
filthy
weeds
to
grow
like
that
are
they
not
all
clean
that
he
has
made
the
potato
it
is
not
filthy
and
the
onion
it
has
a
strong
smell
but
the
demoiselle
meelair
she
ate
much
of
the
onion
when
we
were
not
at
the
island
house
but
in
the
camp
the
smell
of
the
tobacco
this
is
an
affair
of
the
taste
for
me
i
love
it
much
it
is
like
a
spice
when
i
come
home
at
night
to
the
where
the
boys
are
smoking
the
smell
of
the
pipes
runs
far
out
into
the
woods
to
salute
me
it
says
we
are
patrique
come
in
near
to
the
fire
the
smell
of
the
tobacco
is
more
sweet
than
the
smell
of
the
fish
the
pig
loves
it
not
assuredly
but
what
then
i
am
not
a
pig
to
me
it
is
good
good
good
do
you
find
it
like
that
i
had
to
confess
that
in
the
affair
of
taste
i
sided
with
patrick
rather
than
with
the
pig
i
said
my
boy
miss
miller
must
have
said
more
than
that
to
reform
replied
pat
the
second
day
we
were
making
the
lunch
at
midday
on
the
island
below
the
first
rapids
i
smoked
the
pipe
on
a
rock
apart
after
the
collation
mees
meelair
comes
to
me
and
says
my
man
do
you
comprehend
that
the
tobacco
is
a
poison
you
are
committing
the
murder
of
yourself
then
she
tells
me
many
things
about
the
nicoline
i
think
she
calls
him
how
he
goes
into
the
blood
and
into
the
bones
and
into
the
hair
and
how
quickly
he
will
kill
the
cat
and
she
says
very
strong
men
who
smoke
the
tobacco
shall
die
must
have
frightened
you
well
pat
i
suppose
you
threw
away
your
pipe
at
no
this
time
i
continue
to
smoke
for
now
it
is
mees
meelair
who
comes
near
the
pipe
voluntarily
and
it
is
not
my
offence
and
i
remember
while
she
is
talking
the
old
bonhomme
michaud
gerome
he
is
a
capable
man
when
he
was
young
he
could
carry
a
barrel
of
flour
a
mile
without
rest
and
now
that
he
has
years
he
yet
keeps
his
force
and
he
smokes
it
is
astonishing
how
that
old
man
smokes
all
the
day
except
when
he
sleeps
if
the
tobacco
is
a
poison
it
is
a
poison
of
the
slowest
like
the
tea
or
the
coffee
for
the
cat
it
is
quick
yes
but
for
the
man
it
is
long
and
i
am
still
young
only
the
third
day
the
third
day
was
the
worst
it
was
a
day
of
sadness
a
day
of
the
bad
chance
the
demoiselle
meelair
was
not
content
but
that
we
should
leap
the
rapide
des
cedres
in
canoe
it
was
rough
rough
all
and
the
big
rock
at
the
corner
boiling
like
a
kettle
but
it
is
the
ignorant
who
have
the
most
of
boldness
the
demoiselle
meelair
she
was
not
solid
in
the
canoe
she
made
a
jump
and
a
loud
scream
i
did
my
possible
but
the
sea
was
too
high
we
took
in
of
the
water
about
five
buckets
we
were
very
wet
after
that
we
make
the
camp
and
while
i
sit
by
the
fire
to
dry
my
clothes
i
smoke
for
comfort
meelair
she
comes
to
me
once
more
she
says
with
a
sad
voice
am
sorry
that
a
nice
man
so
good
so
brave
is
married
to
a
thing
so
bad
so
sinful
at
first
i
am
mad
when
i
hear
this
because
i
think
she
means
angelique
my
wife
but
immediately
she
goes
on
are
married
to
the
smoking
that
is
sinful
it
is
a
wicked
thing
christians
do
not
smoke
there
is
none
of
the
tobacco
in
heaven
the
men
who
use
it
can
not
go
there
ah
patrique
do
you
wish
to
go
to
the
hell
with
your
pipe
was
a
close
question
i
commented
miss
miller
is
a
plain
speaker
but
what
did
you
say
when
she
asked
you
that
said
replied
patrick
lifting
his
hand
to
his
forehead
i
must
go
where
the
good
god
pleased
to
send
me
and
that
i
would
have
much
joy
to
go
to
the
same
place
with
our
cure
the
pere
morel
who
is
a
great
smoker
i
am
sure
that
the
pipe
of
comfort
is
no
sin
to
that
holy
man
when
he
returns
some
cold
night
from
the
visiting
of
the
sick
it
is
not
sin
not
more
than
the
soft
chair
and
the
warm
fire
it
harms
no
one
and
it
makes
quietness
of
mind
for
me
when
i
see
the
cure
sitting
at
the
door
of
the
presbytere
in
the
evening
coolness
smoking
the
tobacco
very
peaceful
and
when
he
says
to
me
day
patrique
will
you
have
a
pipeful
i
can
not
think
that
is
wicked
no
there
was
a
warmth
of
sincerity
in
the
honest
fellow
utterance
that
spoke
well
for
the
character
of
the
cure
of
gerome
the
good
word
of
a
plain
fisherman
or
hunter
is
worth
more
than
a
degree
of
doctor
of
divinity
from
a
learned
university
i
too
had
grateful
memories
of
good
men
faithful
charitable
wise
devout
men
before
whose
virtues
my
heart
stood
uncovered
and
reverent
men
whose
lives
were
sweet
with
and
whose
words
were
like
stars
of
guidance
to
many
souls
and
i
had
often
seen
these
men
solacing
their
toils
and
inviting
pleasant
kindly
thoughts
with
the
pipe
of
peace
i
wondered
whether
miss
miller
ever
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
any
of
these
men
they
were
not
members
of
the
societies
for
ethical
agitation
but
they
were
profitable
men
to
know
their
very
presence
was
medicinal
it
breathed
patience
and
fidelity
to
duty
and
a
large
quiet
friendliness
then
i
asked
did
she
say
finally
to
turn
you
what
was
her
last
argument
come
pat
you
must
make
it
a
little
shorter
than
she
five
words
it
was
this
tobacco
causes
the
poverty
the
fourth
day
you
remind
yourself
of
the
long
below
the
rapide
gervais
it
was
there
all
the
day
she
spoke
to
me
of
the
money
that
goes
to
the
smoke
two
piastres
the
month
the
year
three
hundred
yes
with
the
interest
more
than
three
hundred
in
ten
years
two
thousand
piastres
in
the
life
of
the
man
but
she
comprehends
well
the
arithmetic
that
demoiselle
meelair
it
was
enormous
the
big
farmer
tremblay
has
not
more
money
at
the
bank
than
that
then
she
asks
me
if
i
have
been
at
quebec
no
if
i
would
love
to
go
of
course
yes
for
two
years
of
the
smoking
we
could
go
the
goodwife
and
me
to
quebec
and
see
the
grand
city
and
the
shops
and
the
many
people
and
the
cathedral
and
perhaps
the
theatre
and
at
the
asylum
of
the
orphans
we
could
seek
one
of
the
little
found
children
to
bring
home
with
us
to
be
our
own
for
knows
it
is
the
sadness
of
our
house
that
we
have
no
child
but
it
was
not
mees
meelair
who
said
that
no
she
would
not
understand
that
patrick
paused
for
a
moment
and
rubbed
his
chin
reflectively
then
he
continued
perhaps
it
seems
strange
to
you
also
that
a
poor
man
should
be
so
hungry
for
children
it
is
not
so
everywhere
not
in
america
i
hear
but
it
is
so
with
us
in
canada
i
know
not
a
man
so
poor
that
he
would
not
feel
richer
for
a
child
i
know
not
a
man
so
happy
that
he
would
not
feel
happier
with
a
child
in
the
house
it
is
the
best
thing
that
the
good
god
gives
to
us
something
to
work
for
something
to
play
with
it
makes
a
man
more
gentle
and
more
strong
and
a
woman
her
heart
is
like
an
empty
nest
if
she
has
not
a
child
it
was
the
darkest
day
that
ever
came
to
angelique
and
me
when
our
little
baby
flew
away
four
years
ago
but
perhaps
if
we
have
not
one
of
our
own
there
is
another
somewhere
a
little
child
of
nobody
that
belongs
to
us
for
the
sake
of
the
love
of
children
jean
boucher
my
cousin
at
joseph
has
taken
two
from
the
asylum
two
i
assure
you
for
as
soon
as
one
was
twelve
years
old
he
said
he
wanted
a
baby
and
so
he
went
back
again
and
got
another
that
is
what
i
should
like
to
pat
said
i
is
an
expensive
business
this
raising
of
children
you
should
think
twice
about
answered
patrick
think
a
hundred
times
and
always
the
same
way
it
costs
little
more
for
three
or
four
or
five
in
the
house
than
for
two
the
only
thing
is
the
money
for
the
journey
to
the
city
the
choice
the
arrangement
with
the
nuns
for
that
one
must
save
and
so
i
have
thrown
away
the
pipe
i
smoke
no
more
the
money
of
the
tobacco
is
for
quebec
and
for
the
little
found
child
i
have
already
eighteen
piastres
and
twenty
sous
in
the
old
box
of
cigars
on
the
at
the
house
this
year
will
bring
more
the
winter
after
the
next
if
we
have
the
good
chance
we
go
to
the
city
the
goodwife
and
me
and
we
come
home
with
the
little
boy
or
maybe
the
little
girl
does
approve
are
a
man
of
virtue
pat
said
i
since
you
will
not
take
your
share
of
the
tobacco
on
this
trip
it
shall
go
to
the
other
men
but
you
shall
have
the
money
instead
to
put
into
your
box
on
the
after
supper
that
evening
i
watched
him
with
some
curiosity
to
see
what
he
would
do
without
his
pipe
he
seemed
restless
and
uneasy
the
other
men
sat
around
the
fire
smoking
but
patrick
was
down
at
the
landing
fussing
over
one
of
the
canoes
which
had
been
somewhat
roughly
handled
on
the
road
coming
in
then
he
began
to
tighten
the
and
hauled
at
them
so
vigorously
that
he
loosened
two
of
the
stakes
then
he
whittled
the
blade
of
his
paddle
for
a
while
and
cut
it
an
inch
too
short
then
he
went
into
the
men
tent
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
sound
of
snoring
told
that
he
had
sought
refuge
in
sleep
at
eight
without
telling
a
single
caribou
story
or
making
any
plans
for
the
next
day
sport
ii
for
several
days
we
lingered
on
the
lake
of
the
beautiful
river
trying
the
fishing
we
explored
all
the
favourite
of
the
trout
at
the
mouths
of
the
streams
and
in
the
cool
but
we
did
not
have
remarkable
success
i
am
bound
to
say
that
patrick
was
not
at
his
best
that
year
as
a
fisherman
he
was
as
ready
to
work
as
interested
as
eager
as
ever
but
he
lacked
steadiness
persistence
patience
some
tranquillizing
influence
seemed
to
have
departed
from
him
that
placid
confidence
in
the
ultimate
certainty
of
catching
fish
which
is
one
of
the
chief
elements
of
good
luck
was
wanting
he
did
not
appear
to
be
able
to
sit
still
in
the
canoe
the
mosquitoes
troubled
him
terribly
he
was
just
as
anxious
as
a
man
could
be
to
have
me
take
plenty
of
the
largest
trout
but
he
was
too
much
in
a
hurry
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
did
not
think
i
cast
the
fly
as
well
as
i
did
formerly
and
that
i
was
too
slow
in
striking
when
the
fish
rose
he
was
distinctly
a
weaker
man
without
his
pipe
but
his
virtuous
resolve
held
firm
there
was
one
place
in
particular
that
required
very
cautious
angling
it
was
a
at
the
mouth
of
the
riviere
du
milieu
an
open
space
about
a
hundred
feet
long
and
fifteen
feet
wide
in
the
midst
of
the
and
surrounded
on
every
side
by
clear
shallow
water
here
the
great
trout
assembled
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
but
it
was
not
easy
to
get
them
you
must
come
up
delicately
in
the
canoe
and
make
fast
to
a
stake
at
the
side
of
the
pool
and
wait
a
long
time
for
the
place
to
get
quiet
and
the
fish
to
recover
from
their
fright
and
come
out
from
under
the
it
had
been
our
custom
to
calm
and
soothe
this
expectant
interval
with
incense
of
the
indian
weed
friendly
to
meditation
and
a
foe
of
haste
to
but
this
year
patrick
could
not
endure
the
waiting
after
five
minutes
he
would
say
the
fishing
is
bad
this
season
there
are
none
of
the
big
ones
here
at
all
let
us
try
another
place
it
will
go
better
at
the
riviere
du
cheval
there
was
only
one
thing
that
would
really
keep
him
quiet
and
that
was
a
conversation
about
quebec
the
glories
of
that
wonderful
city
entranced
his
thoughts
he
was
already
floating
in
imagination
with
the
vast
throngs
of
people
that
filled
its
splendid
streets
looking
up
at
the
stately
houses
and
churches
with
their
glittering
roofs
of
tin
and
staring
his
fill
at
the
magnificent
where
all
the
luxuries
of
the
world
were
displayed
he
had
heard
that
there
were
more
than
a
hundred
shops
separate
shops
for
all
kinds
of
separate
things
some
for
groceries
and
some
for
shoes
and
some
for
clothes
and
some
for
knives
and
axes
and
some
for
guns
and
many
shops
where
they
sold
only
jewels
gold
rings
and
diamonds
and
forks
of
pure
silver
was
it
not
so
he
pictured
himself
side
by
side
with
his
goodwife
in
the
salle
a
manger
of
the
hotel
richelieu
ordering
their
dinner
from
a
printed
bill
of
fare
side
by
side
they
were
walking
on
the
dufferin
terrace
listening
to
the
music
of
the
military
band
side
by
side
they
were
watching
the
wonders
of
the
play
at
the
theatre
de
du
nord
side
by
side
they
were
kneeling
before
the
gorgeous
altar
in
the
cathedral
and
then
they
were
standing
silent
side
by
side
in
the
asylum
of
the
orphans
looking
at
brown
eyes
and
blue
at
black
hair
and
yellow
curls
at
fat
legs
and
rosy
cheeks
and
laughing
mouths
while
the
mother
superior
showed
off
the
little
boys
and
girls
for
them
to
choose
this
affair
of
the
choice
was
always
a
delightful
difficulty
and
here
his
fancy
loved
to
hang
in
suspense
vibrating
between
rival
joys
once
at
the
riviere
du
milieu
after
considerable
discourse
upon
quebec
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
during
which
i
succeeded
in
hooking
and
playing
a
larger
trout
than
usual
as
the
fish
came
up
to
the
side
of
the
canoe
patrick
netted
him
deftly
exclaiming
with
an
abstracted
air
is
a
boy
after
all
i
like
that
our
camp
was
shifted
the
second
week
to
the
grand
lac
des
cedres
and
there
we
had
extraordinary
fortune
with
the
trout
partly
i
conjecture
because
there
was
only
one
place
to
fish
and
so
patrick
uneasy
zeal
could
find
no
excuse
for
keeping
me
in
constant
motion
all
around
the
lake
but
in
the
matter
of
weather
we
were
not
so
happy
there
is
always
a
conflict
in
the
angler
mind
about
the
weather
a
struggle
between
his
desires
as
a
man
and
his
desires
as
a
fisherman
this
time
our
prayers
for
a
good
fishing
season
were
granted
at
the
expense
of
our
suffering
human
nature
there
was
a
conjunction
in
the
zodiac
of
the
signs
of
aquarius
and
pisces
it
rained
as
easily
as
suddenly
as
penetratingly
as
miss
miller
talked
but
in
between
the
showers
the
trout
were
very
hungry
one
day
when
we
were
paddling
home
to
our
tents
among
the
birch
trees
one
of
these
unexpected
storms
came
up
and
patrick
thoughtful
of
my
comfort
as
ever
insisted
on
giving
me
his
coat
to
put
around
my
dripping
shoulders
the
paddling
would
serve
instead
of
a
coat
for
him
he
said
it
would
keep
him
warm
to
his
bones
as
i
slipped
the
garment
over
my
back
something
hard
fell
from
one
of
the
pockets
into
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
it
was
a
pipe
pat
i
cried
is
this
you
said
you
had
thrown
all
your
pipes
away
how
does
this
come
in
your
pocket
he
answered
is
different
this
is
not
the
pipe
pure
and
simple
it
is
a
souvenir
it
is
the
one
you
gave
me
two
years
ago
on
the
metabetchouan
when
we
got
the
big
caribou
i
could
not
reject
this
i
keep
it
always
for
the
at
this
moment
my
hand
fell
upon
a
small
square
object
in
the
other
pocket
of
the
coat
i
pulled
it
out
it
was
a
cake
of
virginia
leaf
without
a
word
i
held
it
up
and
looked
at
patrick
he
began
to
explain
eagerly
certainly
it
is
the
tobacco
but
it
is
not
for
the
smoke
as
you
suppose
it
is
for
the
virtue
for
the
i
call
this
my
little
piece
of
temptation
see
the
edges
are
not
cut
i
smell
it
only
and
when
i
think
how
it
is
good
then
i
speak
to
myself
the
little
found
child
will
be
better
it
will
last
a
long
time
this
little
piece
of
temptation
perhaps
until
we
have
the
boy
at
our
house
or
maybe
the
the
conflict
between
the
cake
of
virginia
leaf
and
patrick
virtue
must
have
been
severe
during
the
last
ten
days
of
our
expedition
for
we
went
down
the
riviere
des
ecorces
and
that
is
a
tough
trip
and
full
of
occasions
when
consolation
is
needed
after
a
long
hard
day
work
cutting
out
an
abandoned
portage
through
the
woods
or
tramping
miles
over
the
incredibly
shaggy
hills
to
some
outlying
pond
for
a
caribou
and
lugging
the
saddle
and
hind
quarters
back
to
the
camp
the
evening
pipe
after
supper
seemed
to
comfort
the
men
unspeakably
if
their
tempers
had
grown
a
little
short
under
stress
of
fatigue
and
hunger
now
they
became
cheerful
and
again
they
sat
on
logs
before
the
their
stockinged
feet
stretched
out
to
the
blaze
and
the
puffs
of
smoke
rose
from
their
lips
like
tiny
salutes
to
the
comfortable
flame
or
like
incense
burned
upon
the
altar
of
gratitude
and
contentment
patrick
i
noticed
about
this
time
liked
to
get
on
the
leeward
side
of
as
many
pipes
as
possible
and
as
near
as
he
could
to
the
smokers
he
said
that
this
kept
away
the
mosquitoes
there
he
would
sit
with
the
smoke
drifting
full
in
his
face
both
hands
in
his
pockets
talking
about
quebec
and
debating
the
comparative
merits
of
a
boy
or
a
girl
as
an
addition
to
his
household
but
the
great
trial
of
his
virtue
was
yet
to
come
the
main
object
of
our
trip
down
the
river
of
barks
the
terminus
ad
quem
of
the
expedition
so
to
speak
was
a
bear
now
the
bear
as
an
object
of
the
chase
at
least
in
canada
is
one
of
the
most
illusory
of
phantoms
the
manner
of
hunting
is
simple
it
consists
in
walking
about
through
the
woods
or
paddling
along
a
stream
until
you
meet
a
bear
then
you
try
to
shoot
him
this
would
seem
to
be
as
the
rev
leslie
called
his
book
against
the
deists
of
the
eighteenth
century
short
and
easie
but
in
point
of
fact
there
are
two
principal
difficulties
the
first
is
that
you
never
find
the
bear
when
and
where
you
are
looking
for
him
the
second
is
that
the
bear
sometimes
finds
you
when
but
you
shall
see
how
it
happened
to
us
we
had
hunted
the
whole
length
of
the
river
of
barks
with
the
utmost
pains
and
caution
never
going
out
even
to
pick
blueberries
without
having
the
rifle
at
hand
loaded
for
the
expected
encounter
not
one
bear
had
we
met
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
ursine
tribe
must
have
emigrated
to
labrador
at
last
we
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
where
it
empties
into
lake
kenogami
in
a
comparatively
civilized
country
with
several
in
full
view
on
the
opposite
bank
it
was
not
a
promising
place
for
the
chase
but
the
river
ran
down
with
a
little
fall
and
a
lively
cheerful
rapid
into
the
lake
and
it
was
a
capital
spot
for
fishing
so
we
left
the
rifle
in
the
case
and
took
a
canoe
and
a
rod
and
went
down
on
the
last
afternoon
to
stand
on
the
point
of
rocks
at
the
foot
of
the
rapid
and
cast
the
fly
we
caught
half
a
dozen
good
trout
but
the
sun
was
still
hot
and
we
concluded
to
wait
awhile
for
the
evening
fishing
so
we
turned
the
canoe
bottom
up
among
the
bushes
on
the
shore
stored
the
trout
away
in
the
shade
beneath
it
and
sat
down
in
a
convenient
place
among
the
stones
to
have
another
chat
about
quebec
we
had
just
passed
the
jewelry
shops
and
were
preparing
to
go
to
the
asylum
of
the
orphans
when
patrick
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
with
a
convulsive
grip
and
pointed
up
the
stream
there
was
a
huge
bear
like
a
very
big
wicked
black
sheep
with
a
pointed
nose
making
his
way
down
the
shore
he
shambled
along
lazily
and
unconcernedly
as
if
his
bones
were
loosely
tied
together
in
a
bag
of
fur
it
was
the
most
indifferent
and
disconnected
gait
that
i
ever
saw
nearer
and
nearer
he
sauntered
while
we
sat
as
still
as
if
we
had
been
paralyzed
and
the
gun
was
in
its
case
at
the
tent
how
the
bear
knew
this
i
can
not
tell
but
know
it
he
certainly
did
for
he
kept
on
until
he
reached
the
canoe
sniffed
at
it
suspiciously
thrust
his
sharp
nose
under
it
and
turned
it
over
with
a
crash
that
knocked
two
holes
in
the
bottom
ate
the
fish
licked
his
chops
stared
at
us
for
a
few
moments
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
gratitude
made
up
his
mind
that
he
did
not
like
our
personal
appearance
and
then
loped
leisurely
up
the
we
could
hear
him
cracking
the
underbrush
long
after
he
was
lost
to
sight
patrick
looked
at
me
and
sighed
i
said
nothing
the
french
language
as
far
as
i
knew
it
seemed
trifling
and
inadequate
it
was
a
moment
when
nothing
could
do
any
good
except
the
consolations
of
philosophy
or
a
pipe
patrick
pulled
the
from
his
pocket
then
he
took
out
the
cake
of
virginia
leaf
looked
at
it
smelled
it
shook
his
head
and
put
it
back
again
his
face
was
as
long
as
his
arm
he
stuck
the
cold
pipe
into
his
mouth
and
pulled
away
at
it
for
a
while
in
silence
then
his
countenance
began
to
clear
his
mouth
relaxed
he
broke
into
a
laugh
bear
he
cried
slapping
his
knee
beast
of
the
world
what
a
day
of
the
good
chance
for
her
he
but
she
was
glad
i
suppose
perhaps
she
has
some
cubs
he
bajette
iii
this
was
the
end
of
our
hunting
and
fishing
for
that
year
we
spent
the
next
two
days
in
voyaging
through
a
small
lakes
and
streams
in
a
farming
country
on
our
way
home
i
observed
that
patrick
kept
his
souvenir
pipe
between
his
lips
a
good
deal
of
the
time
and
puffed
at
vacancy
it
seemed
to
soothe
him
in
his
conversation
he
dwelt
with
peculiar
satisfaction
on
the
thought
of
the
money
in
the
on
the
at
gerome
eighteen
piastres
and
twenty
sous
already
and
with
the
addition
to
be
made
from
the
tobacco
not
smoked
during
the
past
month
it
would
amount
to
more
than
piastres
and
all
as
safe
in
the
as
if
it
were
in
the
bank
at
chicoutimi
that
reflection
seemed
to
fill
the
empty
pipe
with
fragrance
it
was
a
barmecide
smoke
but
the
fumes
of
it
were
potent
and
their
invisible
wreaths
framed
the
most
enchanting
visions
of
tall
towers
gray
walls
glittering
windows
crowds
of
people
regiments
of
soldiers
and
the
laughing
eyes
of
a
little
boy
or
was
it
a
little
girl
when
we
came
out
of
the
mouth
of
la
belle
riviere
the
broad
blue
expanse
of
lake
john
spread
before
us
calm
and
bright
in
the
radiance
of
the
sinking
sun
in
a
curve
on
the
left
eight
miles
away
sparkled
the
slender
steeple
of
the
church
of
gerome
a
thick
column
of
smoke
rose
from
somewhere
in
its
neighbourhood
is
on
the
beach
said
the
men
boys
of
the
village
accustom
themselves
to
burn
the
rubbish
there
for
a
but
as
our
canoes
danced
lightly
forward
over
the
waves
and
came
nearer
to
the
place
it
was
evident
that
the
smoke
came
from
the
village
itself
it
was
a
conflagration
but
not
a
general
one
the
houses
were
too
scattered
and
the
day
too
still
for
a
fire
to
spread
what
could
it
be
perhaps
the
blacksmith
shop
perhaps
the
bakery
perhaps
the
old
barn
of
the
little
tremblay
it
was
not
a
large
fire
that
was
certain
but
where
was
it
precisely
the
question
becoming
more
and
more
anxious
was
answered
when
we
arrived
at
the
beach
a
handful
of
boys
eager
to
be
the
bearers
of
news
had
spied
us
far
off
and
ran
down
to
the
shore
to
meet
us
patrique
they
shouted
in
english
to
make
their
importance
as
great
as
possible
in
my
eyes
kveek
yo
ees
hall
burn
cried
patrick
and
he
drove
the
canoe
ashore
leaped
out
and
ran
up
the
bank
toward
the
village
as
if
he
were
mad
the
other
men
followed
him
leaving
me
with
the
boys
to
unload
the
canoes
and
pull
them
up
on
the
sand
where
the
waves
would
not
chafe
them
this
took
some
time
and
the
boys
helped
me
willingly
ees
not
need
to
they
assured
me
to
patrique
moullarque
ees
hall
burn
seence
hour
lef
bot
de
as
soon
as
possible
however
i
piled
up
the
stuff
covered
it
with
one
of
the
tents
and
leaving
it
in
charge
of
the
steadiest
of
the
boys
took
the
road
to
the
village
and
the
site
of
the
maison
mullarkey
it
had
vanished
completely
the
walls
of
squared
logs
were
gone
the
low
curved
roof
had
fallen
the
with
the
vines
climbing
up
beside
it
had
sunken
out
of
sight
nothing
remained
but
the
dome
of
the
clay
oven
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
a
heap
of
smouldering
embers
patrick
sat
beside
his
wife
on
a
flat
stone
that
had
formerly
supported
the
corner
of
the
porch
his
shoulder
was
close
to
angelique
so
close
that
it
looked
almost
as
if
he
must
have
had
his
arm
around
her
a
moment
before
i
came
up
his
passion
and
grief
had
calmed
themselves
down
now
and
he
was
quite
tranquil
in
his
left
hand
he
held
the
cake
of
virginia
leaf
in
his
right
a
knife
he
was
cutting
off
delicate
slivers
of
the
tobacco
which
he
rolled
together
with
a
circular
motion
between
his
palms
then
he
pulled
his
pipe
from
his
pocket
and
filled
the
bowl
with
great
deliberation
a
misfortune
i
cried
pretty
house
is
gone
i
am
so
sorry
patrick
and
the
box
of
money
on
the
that
is
gone
too
i
fear
all
your
savings
what
a
terrible
misfortune
how
did
it
happen
can
not
tell
he
answered
rather
slowly
is
the
good
god
and
he
has
left
me
my
angelique
also
you
here
he
went
over
to
the
pile
of
ashes
and
pulled
out
a
fragment
of
charred
wood
with
a
live
coal
at
the
end
puff
puff
has
given
puff
puff
light
for
my
pipe
puff
puff
puff
the
fragrant
friendly
smoke
was
pouring
out
now
in
full
volume
it
enwreathed
his
head
like
drifts
of
cloud
around
the
rugged
top
of
a
mountain
at
sunrise
i
could
see
that
his
face
was
spreading
into
a
smile
of
ineffable
contentment
faith
said
i
can
you
be
so
cheerful
your
house
is
in
ashes
your
money
is
burned
up
the
voyage
to
quebec
the
visit
to
the
asylum
the
little
orphan
how
can
you
give
it
all
up
so
easily
he
replied
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
with
fingers
curling
around
the
bowl
as
if
they
loved
to
feel
that
it
was
warm
once
more
then
it
would
be
more
hard
i
suppose
to
give
it
up
not
easily
and
then
for
the
house
we
shall
build
a
new
one
this
fall
the
neighbours
will
help
and
for
the
voyage
to
quebec
without
that
we
may
be
happy
and
as
regards
the
little
orphan
i
will
tell
you
here
he
went
back
to
his
seat
upon
the
flat
stone
and
settled
himself
with
an
air
of
great
comfort
beside
his
partner
tell
you
in
confidence
angelique
demands
that
i
prepare
a
particular
furniture
at
the
new
house
yes
it
is
a
cradle
but
it
is
not
for
an
iv
it
was
late
in
the
following
summer
when
i
came
back
again
to
gerome
the
and
the
asters
were
all
in
bloom
along
the
village
street
and
as
i
walked
down
it
the
broad
golden
sunlight
of
the
short
afternoon
seemed
to
glorify
the
open
road
and
the
plain
square
houses
with
a
careless
homely
rapture
of
peace
the
air
was
softly
fragrant
with
the
odour
of
balm
of
gilead
a
yellow
warbler
sang
from
a
little
clump
of
tinkling
out
his
contented
song
like
a
chime
of
tiny
bells
sweet
sweet
sweeter
sweeter
sweetest
there
was
the
new
house
a
little
farther
back
from
the
road
than
the
old
one
and
in
the
place
where
the
heap
of
ashes
had
lain
a
primitive
garden
with
marigolds
and
lupines
and
zinnias
all
abloom
and
there
was
patrick
sitting
on
the
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
cool
of
the
day
yes
and
there
on
a
counterpane
spread
beside
him
an
infant
joy
of
the
house
of
mullarkey
was
sucking
her
thumb
while
her
father
was
humming
the
words
of
an
old
sainte
marguerite
veillez
ma
petite
endormez
ma
enfant
de
quinze
ans
quand
elle
aura
quinze
ans
passe
il
faudra
la
marier
avec
un
bonhomme
que
viendra
de
rome
patrick
i
cried
luck
to
you
is
it
a
girl
or
a
boy
he
answered
jumping
up
and
waving
his
pipe
is
a
girl
and
a
boy
sure
enough
as
i
entered
the
door
i
beheld
angelique
rocking
the
other
half
of
the
reward
of
virtue
in
the
new
cradle
iii
a
brave
heart
was
truly
his
name
raoul
vaillantcoeur
a
name
of
the
fine
sound
is
it
not
you
like
that
word
a
valiant
heart
it
pleases
you
eh
the
man
who
calls
himself
by
such
a
name
as
that
ought
to
be
a
brave
fellow
a
veritable
hero
well
perhaps
but
i
know
an
indian
who
is
called
le
blanc
that
means
white
and
a
white
man
who
is
called
lenoir
that
means
black
it
is
very
droll
this
affair
of
the
names
it
is
like
the
silence
for
a
few
moments
broken
only
by
the
ripple
of
water
under
the
bow
of
the
canoe
the
persistent
patter
of
the
rain
all
around
us
and
the
slish
slish
of
the
paddle
with
which
ferdinand
my
canadian
voyageur
was
pushing
the
down
the
lonely
length
of
lac
moise
i
knew
that
there
was
one
of
his
stories
on
the
way
but
i
must
keep
still
to
get
it
a
single
comment
a
word
that
would
raise
a
question
of
morals
or
social
philosophy
might
switch
the
narrative
off
the
track
into
a
swamp
of
abstract
discourse
in
which
ferdinand
would
lose
himself
presently
the
voice
behind
me
began
again
that
word
vaillant
with
us
in
canada
it
does
not
mean
always
the
same
as
with
you
sometimes
we
use
it
for
something
that
sounds
big
but
does
little
a
gun
that
goes
off
with
a
terrible
crack
but
shoots
not
straight
nor
far
when
a
man
is
like
that
he
is
fanfaron
he
shows
off
well
but
well
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
when
you
hear
what
happened
between
this
man
vaillantcoeur
and
his
friend
prosper
leclere
at
the
building
of
the
stone
tower
of
the
church
at
abbeville
you
remind
yourself
of
that
grand
church
with
the
tall
tower
yes
with
permission
i
am
going
to
tell
you
what
passed
when
that
was
made
and
you
shall
decide
whether
there
was
truly
a
brave
heart
in
the
story
or
not
and
if
it
went
with
the
thus
the
tale
began
in
the
vast
solitude
of
the
northern
forest
among
the
granite
peaks
of
the
ancient
laurentian
mountains
on
a
lake
that
knew
no
human
habitation
save
the
indian
wigwam
or
the
tent
how
it
rained
that
day
the
dark
clouds
had
collapsed
upon
the
hills
in
shapeless
folds
the
waves
of
the
lake
were
beaten
flat
by
the
lashing
strokes
of
the
storm
quivering
sheets
of
watery
gray
were
driven
before
the
wind
and
broad
curves
of
silver
bullets
danced
before
them
as
they
swept
over
the
surface
all
around
the
homeless
shores
the
evergreen
trees
seemed
to
hunch
their
backs
and
crowd
closer
together
in
patient
misery
not
a
bird
had
the
heart
to
sing
only
the
loon
laughed
his
crazy
challenge
to
the
elements
and
mocked
us
with
his
maniac
scream
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
a
thousand
miles
from
everywhere
and
everybody
cities
factories
libraries
colleges
theatres
palaces
what
had
we
dreamed
of
these
things
they
were
far
off
in
another
world
we
had
slipped
back
into
a
primitive
life
ferdinand
was
telling
me
the
naked
story
of
human
love
and
human
hate
even
as
it
has
been
told
from
the
beginning
i
can
not
tell
it
just
as
he
did
there
was
a
charm
in
his
speech
too
quick
for
the
pen
a
woodland
savour
not
to
be
found
in
any
ink
for
sale
in
the
shops
i
must
tell
it
in
my
way
as
he
told
it
in
his
but
at
all
events
nothing
that
makes
any
difference
shall
go
into
the
translation
unless
it
was
in
the
original
this
is
ferdinand
story
if
you
care
for
the
real
thing
here
it
is
i
there
were
two
young
men
in
abbeville
who
were
easily
the
cocks
of
the
woodland
walk
their
standing
rested
on
the
fact
that
they
were
the
strongest
men
in
the
parish
strength
is
the
thing
that
counts
when
people
live
on
the
edge
of
the
wilderness
these
two
were
well
known
all
through
the
country
between
lake
john
and
chicoutimi
as
men
of
great
capacity
either
of
them
could
shoulder
a
barrel
of
flour
and
walk
off
with
it
as
lightly
as
a
common
man
would
carry
a
side
of
bacon
there
was
not
a
of
difference
between
them
in
ability
but
there
was
a
great
difference
in
their
looks
and
in
their
way
of
doing
things
raoul
vaillantcoeur
was
the
biggest
and
the
handsomest
man
in
the
village
nearly
six
feet
tall
straight
as
a
fir
tree
and
black
as
a
in
december
he
had
natural
force
enough
and
to
spare
whatever
he
did
was
done
by
sheer
power
of
back
and
arm
he
could
send
a
canoe
up
against
the
heaviest
water
provided
he
did
not
get
mad
and
break
his
paddle
which
he
often
did
he
had
more
muscle
than
he
knew
how
to
use
prosper
leclere
did
not
have
so
much
but
he
knew
better
how
to
handle
it
he
never
broke
his
paddle
unless
it
happened
to
be
a
bad
one
and
then
he
generally
had
another
all
ready
in
the
canoe
he
was
at
least
four
inches
shorter
than
vaillantcoeur
broad
shoulders
long
arms
light
hair
gray
eyes
not
a
handsome
fellow
but
and
very
quiet
what
he
did
was
done
more
than
half
with
his
head
he
was
the
kind
of
a
man
that
never
needs
more
than
one
match
to
light
a
fire
but
vaillantcoeur
well
if
the
wood
was
wet
he
might
use
a
dozen
and
when
the
blaze
was
kindled
as
like
as
not
he
would
throw
in
the
rest
of
the
box
now
these
two
men
had
been
friends
and
were
changed
into
rivals
at
least
that
was
the
way
that
one
of
them
looked
at
it
and
most
of
the
people
in
the
parish
seemed
to
think
that
was
the
right
view
it
was
a
strange
thing
and
not
altogether
satisfactory
to
the
public
mind
to
have
two
strongest
men
in
the
village
the
question
of
comparative
standing
in
the
community
ought
to
be
raised
and
settled
in
the
usual
way
raoul
was
perfectly
willing
and
at
times
commonly
on
saturday
nights
very
eager
but
prosper
was
not
he
said
one
march
night
when
he
was
boiling
in
the
with
little
ovide
rossignol
who
had
a
lyric
passion
for
holding
the
coat
while
another
man
was
fighting
for
what
shall
i
fight
with
raoul
as
boys
we
have
played
together
once
in
the
rapids
of
the
belle
riviere
when
i
have
fallen
in
the
water
i
think
he
has
saved
my
life
he
was
stronger
then
than
me
i
am
always
a
friend
to
him
if
i
beat
him
now
am
i
stronger
no
but
weaker
and
if
he
beats
me
what
is
the
sense
of
that
certainly
i
shall
not
like
it
what
is
to
gain
down
in
the
store
of
old
girard
that
night
vaillantcoeur
was
holding
forth
after
a
different
fashion
he
stood
among
the
and
with
a
background
of
shelves
laden
with
calicoes
and
a
line
of
tin
pails
hanging
overhead
and
stated
his
view
of
the
case
with
vigour
he
even
pulled
off
his
coat
and
rolled
up
his
to
show
the
knotty
arguments
with
which
he
proposed
to
clinch
his
opinion
leclere
said
he
little
prosper
leclere
he
thinks
himself
one
of
the
strongest
a
fine
fellow
but
i
tell
you
he
is
a
coward
if
he
is
clever
yes
but
he
is
a
poltroon
he
knows
well
that
i
can
flatten
him
out
like
a
crepe
in
the
but
he
is
afraid
he
has
not
as
much
courage
as
the
you
stamp
on
the
bank
he
dives
he
swims
away
bah
about
that
time
he
cut
loose
the
jam
of
logs
in
the
rapide
des
cedres
said
old
girard
from
his
corner
vaillantcoeur
black
eyes
sparkled
and
he
twirled
his
mustache
fiercely
he
cried
was
nothing
any
man
with
an
axe
can
cut
a
log
but
to
fight
that
is
another
affair
that
demands
the
brave
heart
the
strong
man
who
will
not
fight
is
a
coward
some
day
i
will
put
him
through
the
mill
you
shall
see
what
that
small
leclere
is
made
of
sacredam
of
course
affairs
had
not
come
to
this
pass
all
at
once
it
was
a
long
history
beginning
with
the
time
when
the
two
boys
had
played
together
and
raoul
was
twice
as
strong
as
the
other
and
was
very
proud
of
it
prosper
did
not
care
it
was
all
right
so
long
as
they
had
a
good
time
but
then
prosper
began
to
do
things
better
and
better
raoul
did
not
understand
it
he
was
jealous
why
should
he
not
always
be
the
leader
he
had
more
force
why
should
prosper
get
ahead
why
should
he
have
better
luck
at
the
fishing
and
the
hunting
and
the
farming
it
was
by
some
trick
there
was
no
justice
in
it
raoul
was
not
afraid
of
anything
but
death
and
whatever
he
wanted
he
thought
he
had
a
right
to
have
but
he
did
not
know
very
well
how
to
get
it
he
would
start
to
chop
a
log
just
at
the
spot
where
there
was
a
big
knot
he
was
the
kind
of
a
man
that
sets
on
a
and
then
curses
his
luck
because
he
catches
nothing
besides
whatever
he
did
he
was
always
thinking
most
about
beating
somebody
else
but
prosper
eared
most
for
doing
the
thing
as
well
as
he
could
if
any
one
else
could
beat
him
well
what
difference
did
it
make
he
would
do
better
the
next
time
if
he
had
a
log
to
chop
he
looked
it
all
over
for
a
clear
place
before
he
began
what
he
wanted
was
not
to
make
the
chips
fly
but
to
get
the
wood
split
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
the
one
man
was
a
saint
and
a
hero
and
the
other
a
fool
and
a
ruffian
no
that
sort
of
thing
happens
only
in
books
people
in
abbeville
were
not
made
on
that
plan
they
were
both
plain
men
but
there
was
a
difference
in
their
hearts
and
out
of
that
difference
grew
all
the
trouble
it
was
hard
on
vaillantcoeur
of
course
to
see
leclere
going
ahead
getting
rich
clearing
off
the
mortgage
on
his
farm
laying
up
money
with
the
notary
bergeron
who
acted
as
banker
for
the
parish
it
was
hard
to
look
on
at
this
while
he
himself
stood
still
or
even
slipped
back
a
little
got
into
debt
had
to
sell
a
bit
of
the
land
that
his
father
left
him
there
must
be
some
cheating
about
it
but
this
was
not
the
hardest
morsel
to
swallow
the
great
thing
that
stuck
in
his
crop
was
the
idea
that
the
little
prosper
whom
he
could
have
whipped
so
easily
and
whom
he
had
protected
so
loftily
when
they
were
boys
now
stood
just
as
high
as
he
did
as
a
capable
man
perhaps
even
higher
why
was
it
that
when
the
price
brothers
down
at
chicoutimi
had
a
good
up
in
the
woods
on
the
belle
riviere
they
made
leclere
the
boss
instead
of
vaillantcoeur
why
did
the
cure
villeneuve
choose
prosper
and
not
raoul
to
steady
the
strain
of
the
biggest
pole
when
they
were
setting
up
the
derrick
for
the
building
of
the
new
church
it
was
rough
rough
the
more
raoul
thought
of
it
the
rougher
it
seemed
the
fact
that
it
was
a
man
who
had
once
been
his
protege
and
still
insisted
on
being
his
best
friend
did
not
make
it
any
smoother
would
you
have
liked
it
any
better
on
that
account
i
am
not
telling
you
how
it
ought
to
have
been
i
am
telling
you
how
it
was
this
vaillantcoeur
it
his
story
you
must
strike
your
balances
as
you
go
along
and
all
the
time
you
see
he
felt
sure
that
he
was
a
stronger
man
and
a
braver
man
than
prosper
he
was
hungry
to
prove
it
in
the
only
way
that
he
could
understand
the
sense
of
rivalry
grew
into
a
passion
of
hatred
and
the
hatred
shaped
itself
into
a
blind
headstrong
desire
to
fight
everything
that
prosper
did
well
seemed
like
a
challenge
every
success
that
he
had
was
as
hard
to
bear
as
an
insult
all
the
more
because
prosper
seemed
unconscious
of
it
he
refused
to
take
offence
went
about
his
work
quietly
and
cheerfully
turned
off
hard
words
with
a
joke
went
out
of
his
way
to
show
himself
friendly
and
in
reality
of
course
he
knew
well
enough
how
matters
stood
but
he
was
resolved
not
to
show
that
he
knew
if
he
could
help
it
and
in
any
event
not
to
be
one
of
the
two
that
are
needed
to
make
a
quarrel
he
felt
very
strangely
about
it
there
was
a
presentiment
in
his
heart
that
he
did
not
dare
to
shake
off
it
seemed
as
if
this
conflict
were
one
that
would
threaten
the
happiness
of
his
whole
life
he
still
kept
his
old
feeling
of
attraction
to
raoul
the
memory
of
the
many
happy
days
they
had
spent
together
and
though
the
friendship
of
course
could
never
again
be
what
it
had
been
there
was
something
of
it
left
at
least
on
prosper
side
to
struggle
with
this
man
strike
at
his
face
try
to
maim
and
disfigure
him
roll
over
and
over
on
the
ground
with
him
like
two
dogs
tearing
each
other
the
thought
was
hateful
his
gorge
rose
at
it
he
would
never
do
it
unless
to
save
his
life
then
well
then
god
must
be
his
judge
so
it
was
that
these
two
men
stood
against
each
other
in
abbeville
just
as
strongly
as
raoul
was
set
to
get
into
a
fight
just
so
strongly
was
prosper
set
to
keep
out
of
one
it
was
a
trial
of
strength
between
two
passions
the
passion
of
friendship
and
the
passion
of
fighting
two
or
three
things
happened
to
put
an
edge
on
raoul
hunger
for
an
fight
the
first
was
the
affair
at
the
shanty
on
lac
des
caps
the
like
sailors
have
a
way
of
putting
a
new
man
through
a
few
tricks
to
initiate
him
into
the
camp
leclere
was
bossing
the
job
with
a
gang
of
ten
men
from
raymond
under
him
vaillantcoeur
had
just
driven
a
team
in
over
the
snow
with
a
load
of
provisions
and
was
lounging
around
the
camp
as
if
it
belonged
to
him
it
was
sunday
afternoon
the
regular
time
for
fun
but
no
one
dared
to
take
hold
of
him
he
looked
too
big
he
expressed
his
opinion
of
the
camp
fun
in
this
shanty
he
i
suppose
that
little
leclere
he
makes
you
others
work
and
say
your
prayers
and
then
for
the
rest
you
can
sleep
he
well
i
am
going
to
make
a
little
fun
for
you
my
boys
come
prosper
get
your
hat
if
you
are
able
to
climb
a
he
snatched
the
hat
from
the
table
by
the
stove
and
ran
out
into
the
snow
in
front
of
the
shanty
a
birch
tall
smooth
very
straight
was
still
standing
he
went
up
the
trunk
like
a
bear
but
there
was
a
dead
balsam
that
had
fallen
against
the
birch
and
lodged
on
the
lower
branches
it
was
barely
strong
enough
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
light
man
up
this
slanting
ladder
prosper
ran
quickly
in
his
moccasined
feet
snatched
the
hat
from
raoul
teeth
as
he
swarmed
up
the
trunk
and
ran
down
again
as
he
neared
the
ground
the
balsam
shaken
from
its
lodgement
cracked
and
fell
raoul
was
left
up
the
tree
perched
among
the
branches
out
of
breath
luck
had
set
the
scene
for
the
lumberman
favourite
trick
him
down
chop
him
was
the
cry
and
a
trio
of
axes
were
twanging
against
the
birch
tree
while
the
other
men
shouted
and
laughed
and
pelted
the
tree
with
ice
to
keep
the
prisoner
from
climbing
down
prosper
neither
shouted
nor
chopped
but
he
grinned
a
little
as
he
watched
the
tree
quiver
and
shake
and
heard
the
rain
of
and
that
came
out
of
the
swaying
top
he
grinned
until
he
saw
that
a
more
blows
would
fell
the
birch
right
on
the
roof
of
the
shanty
you
crazy
he
cried
as
he
picked
up
an
axe
know
nothing
how
to
chop
you
kill
a
man
you
smash
the
cabane
let
go
he
shoved
one
of
the
boys
away
and
sent
a
few
mighty
cuts
into
the
side
of
the
birch
that
was
farthest
from
the
cabin
then
two
short
cuts
on
the
other
side
the
tree
shivered
staggered
cracked
and
swept
in
a
great
arc
toward
the
deep
by
the
brook
as
the
top
swung
earthward
raoul
jumped
clear
of
the
crashing
branches
and
landed
safely
in
the
of
snow
buried
up
to
his
neck
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
him
but
his
head
like
some
new
kind
of
sputtering
bad
words
well
this
was
the
first
thing
that
put
an
edge
on
hunger
to
fight
no
man
likes
to
be
chopped
down
by
his
friend
even
if
the
friend
does
it
for
the
sake
of
saving
him
from
being
killed
by
a
fall
on
the
it
is
easy
to
forget
that
part
of
it
what
you
remember
is
the
grin
the
second
thing
that
made
it
worse
was
the
bad
chance
that
both
of
these
men
had
to
fall
in
love
with
the
same
girl
of
course
there
were
other
girls
in
the
village
beside
marie
antoinette
girard
plenty
of
them
and
good
girls
too
but
somehow
or
other
when
they
were
beside
her
neither
raoul
nor
prosper
cared
to
look
at
any
of
them
but
only
at
her
eyes
were
so
much
darker
and
her
cheeks
so
much
more
red
bright
as
the
berries
of
the
in
september
her
hair
hung
down
to
her
waist
on
sunday
in
two
long
braids
brown
and
shiny
like
a
ripe
hazelnut
and
her
voice
when
she
laughed
made
the
sound
of
water
tumbling
over
little
stones
no
one
knew
which
of
the
two
lovers
she
liked
best
at
school
it
was
certainly
raoul
because
he
was
bigger
and
bolder
when
she
came
back
from
her
year
in
the
convent
at
roberval
it
was
certainly
prosper
because
he
could
talk
better
and
had
read
more
books
he
had
a
volume
of
songs
full
of
love
and
romance
and
knew
most
of
them
by
heart
but
this
did
not
last
forever
manners
had
been
polished
at
the
convent
but
her
ideas
were
still
those
of
her
own
people
she
never
thought
that
knowledge
of
books
could
take
the
place
of
strength
in
the
real
battle
of
life
she
was
a
brave
girl
and
she
felt
sure
in
her
heart
that
the
man
of
the
most
courage
must
be
the
best
man
after
all
for
a
while
she
appeared
to
persuade
herself
that
it
was
prosper
beyond
a
doubt
and
always
took
his
part
when
the
other
girls
laughed
at
him
but
this
was
not
altogether
a
good
sign
when
a
girl
really
loves
she
does
not
talk
she
acts
the
current
of
opinion
and
gossip
in
the
village
was
too
strong
for
her
by
the
time
of
the
affair
of
the
at
lac
des
caps
her
heart
was
swinging
to
and
fro
like
a
pendulum
one
week
she
would
walk
home
from
mass
with
raoul
the
next
week
she
would
loiter
in
the
front
yard
on
a
saturday
evening
and
talk
over
the
gate
with
prosper
until
her
father
called
her
into
the
shop
to
wait
on
customers
it
was
in
one
of
these
talks
that
the
pendulum
seemed
to
make
its
last
swing
and
settle
down
to
its
prosper
was
telling
her
of
the
good
crops
of
sugar
that
he
had
made
from
his
maple
grove
profit
will
be
large
more
than
sixty
piastres
and
with
that
i
shall
buy
at
chicoutimi
a
new
of
the
finest
a
veritable
wedding
carriage
if
you
if
i
shall
we
ride
together
his
left
hand
clasped
hers
as
it
lay
on
the
gate
his
right
arm
stole
over
the
low
picket
fence
and
went
around
the
shoulder
that
leaned
against
the
the
road
was
quite
empty
the
night
already
dark
he
could
feel
her
warm
breath
on
his
neck
as
she
laughed
you
if
i
if
what
why
so
many
ifs
in
this
fine
speech
of
whom
is
the
wedding
for
which
this
new
carriage
is
to
be
bought
do
you
know
what
raoul
vaillantcoeur
has
said
more
wedding
in
this
parish
till
i
have
thrown
the
little
prosper
over
my
shoulder
as
she
said
this
laughing
she
turned
closer
to
the
fence
and
looked
up
so
that
a
curl
on
her
forehead
brushed
against
his
cheek
who
told
you
he
said
that
heard
him
the
store
two
nights
ago
but
it
was
not
for
the
first
time
he
said
it
when
we
came
from
the
church
together
it
will
be
four
weeks
did
you
say
to
him
told
him
perhaps
he
was
mistaken
the
next
wedding
might
be
after
the
little
prosper
had
measured
the
road
with
the
back
of
the
longest
man
in
the
laugh
had
gone
out
of
her
voice
now
she
was
speaking
eagerly
and
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
with
quick
breaths
but
prosper
right
arm
had
dropped
from
her
shoulder
and
his
hand
gripped
the
fence
as
he
straightened
up
he
cried
was
bravely
said
and
i
could
do
it
yes
i
know
i
could
do
it
but
mon
dieu
what
shall
i
say
three
years
now
he
has
pushed
me
every
one
has
pushed
me
to
fight
and
you
but
i
can
not
i
am
not
capable
of
the
girl
hand
lay
in
his
as
cold
and
still
as
a
stone
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
coldly
not
not
because
of
the
old
friendship
because
he
pulled
me
out
of
the
river
long
ago
because
i
am
still
his
friend
because
now
he
hates
me
too
much
because
it
would
be
a
black
fight
because
shame
and
evil
would
come
of
it
whoever
won
that
is
what
i
fear
her
hand
slipped
suddenly
away
from
his
she
stepped
back
from
the
gate
you
have
fear
monsieur
leclere
truly
i
had
not
thought
of
that
it
is
strange
for
so
strong
a
man
it
is
a
little
stupid
to
be
afraid
i
hear
my
father
calling
me
perhaps
some
one
in
the
store
who
wants
to
be
served
you
must
tell
me
again
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
the
new
carriage
she
was
laughing
again
but
it
was
a
different
laughter
prosper
at
the
gate
did
not
think
it
sounded
like
the
running
of
a
brook
over
the
stones
no
it
was
more
the
noise
of
the
dry
branches
that
knock
together
in
the
wind
he
did
not
hear
the
sigh
that
came
as
she
shut
the
door
of
the
house
nor
see
how
slowly
she
walked
through
the
passage
into
the
store
ii
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
many
rainy
saturdays
that
spring
and
in
the
early
summer
the
trade
in
girard
store
was
so
brisk
that
it
appeared
to
need
all
the
force
of
the
establishment
to
attend
to
it
the
gate
of
the
front
yard
had
no
more
strain
put
upon
its
hinges
it
fell
into
a
stiff
propriety
of
opening
and
shutting
at
the
touch
of
people
who
understood
that
a
gate
was
made
merely
to
pass
through
not
to
lean
upon
that
summer
vaillantcoeur
had
a
new
hat
a
black
and
shiny
beaver
and
a
new
cravat
they
looked
fine
on
corpus
christi
day
when
he
and
walked
together
as
fiancee
you
would
have
thought
he
would
have
been
content
with
that
proud
he
certainly
was
he
stepped
like
the
cure
big
rooster
with
the
topknot
almost
as
far
up
in
the
air
as
he
did
along
the
ground
and
he
held
his
chin
high
as
if
he
liked
to
look
at
things
over
his
nose
but
he
was
not
satisfied
all
the
way
through
he
thought
more
of
beating
prosper
than
of
getting
and
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
had
beaten
him
yet
perhaps
the
girl
still
liked
prosper
a
little
perhaps
she
still
thought
of
his
romances
and
his
chansons
and
his
fine
smooth
words
and
missed
them
perhaps
she
was
too
silent
and
dull
sometimes
when
she
walked
with
raoul
and
sometimes
she
laughed
too
loud
when
he
talked
more
at
him
than
with
him
perhaps
those
raymond
fellows
still
remembered
the
way
his
head
stuck
out
of
that
cursed
and
joked
about
it
and
said
how
clever
and
quick
the
little
prosper
was
perhaps
ah
maudit
a
thousand
times
perhaps
and
only
one
way
to
settle
them
the
old
way
the
sure
way
and
all
the
better
now
because
must
be
on
his
side
she
must
understand
for
sure
that
the
bravest
man
in
the
parish
had
chosen
her
that
was
the
summer
of
the
building
of
the
grand
stone
tower
of
the
church
the
men
of
abbeville
did
it
themselves
with
their
own
hands
for
the
glory
of
god
they
were
keen
about
that
and
the
cure
was
the
keenest
of
them
all
no
sharing
of
that
glory
with
workmen
from
quebec
if
you
please
abbeville
was
only
forty
years
old
but
they
already
understood
the
glory
of
god
quite
as
well
there
as
at
quebec
without
doubt
they
could
build
their
own
tower
perfectly
and
they
would
besides
it
would
cost
less
vaillantcoeur
was
the
chief
carpenter
he
attended
to
the
affair
of
beams
and
timbers
leclere
was
the
chief
mason
he
directed
the
affair
of
dressing
the
stones
and
laying
them
that
required
a
very
careful
head
you
understand
for
the
tower
must
be
straight
in
the
floor
a
little
crookedness
did
not
matter
but
in
the
wall
that
might
be
serious
people
have
been
killed
by
a
falling
tower
of
course
if
they
were
going
into
church
they
would
be
sure
of
heaven
but
then
think
what
a
disgrace
for
abbeville
every
one
was
glad
that
leclere
bossed
the
raising
of
the
tower
they
admitted
that
he
might
not
be
brave
but
he
was
assuredly
careful
vaillantcoeur
alone
grumbled
and
said
the
work
went
too
slowly
and
even
swore
that
the
sockets
for
the
beams
were
too
shallow
or
else
too
deep
it
made
no
difference
which
that
bete
prosper
made
trouble
always
by
his
poor
work
but
the
friction
never
came
to
a
blaze
for
the
cure
was
pottering
about
the
tower
every
day
and
all
day
long
and
a
few
words
from
him
would
make
a
quarrel
go
off
in
smoke
my
boys
he
would
say
smooth
and
you
work
fast
the
logs
in
the
river
run
well
when
they
run
all
the
same
way
but
when
two
logs
cross
each
other
on
the
same
rock
psst
a
jam
the
whole
drive
is
hung
up
do
not
run
crossways
my
the
walls
rose
steadily
straight
as
a
steamboat
pipe
ten
twenty
thirty
forty
feet
it
was
time
to
put
in
the
two
lay
the
floor
of
the
belfry
finish
off
the
stonework
and
begin
the
pointed
wooden
spire
the
cure
had
gone
to
quebec
that
very
day
to
buy
the
shining
plates
of
tin
for
the
roof
and
a
beautiful
cross
of
gilt
for
the
pinnacle
leclere
was
in
front
of
the
tower
putting
on
his
overalls
vaillantcoeur
came
up
swearing
mad
three
or
four
other
workmen
were
standing
about
here
you
leclere
said
he
tried
one
of
the
yesterday
afternoon
and
it
would
go
the
templet
on
the
north
is
crooked
crooked
as
your
teeth
we
had
to
let
the
girder
down
again
i
suppose
we
must
trim
it
off
some
way
to
get
a
level
bearing
and
make
the
tower
weak
just
to
match
your
sacre
bad
work
eh
said
prosper
pleasant
and
quiet
enough
sorry
for
that
raoul
perhaps
i
could
put
that
templet
straight
or
perhaps
the
girder
might
be
a
little
warped
and
twisted
eh
what
suppose
we
measure
sure
enough
they
found
the
long
timber
was
not
half
seasoned
and
had
corkscrewed
itself
out
of
shape
at
least
three
inches
vaillantcoeur
sat
on
the
sill
of
the
doorway
and
did
not
even
look
at
them
while
they
were
measuring
when
they
called
out
to
him
what
they
had
found
he
strode
over
to
them
a
dam
lie
he
said
sullenly
leclere
you
slipped
the
string
none
of
your
sacre
cheating
i
have
enough
of
it
already
will
you
fight
you
cursed
sneak
prosper
face
went
gray
like
the
mortar
in
the
trough
his
fists
clenched
and
the
cords
on
his
neck
stood
out
as
if
they
were
ropes
he
breathed
hard
but
he
only
said
three
words
not
here
why
not
there
is
room
the
cure
is
away
why
not
here
is
the
house
of
le
bon
dieu
can
we
build
it
in
hate
you
make
an
excuse
then
come
to
girard
and
fight
again
prosper
held
in
for
a
moment
and
spoke
three
words
not
now
but
when
you
heart
of
a
hare
will
you
sneak
out
of
it
until
you
turn
gray
and
die
when
will
you
fight
little
i
have
forgotten
when
i
am
no
more
your
prosper
picked
up
his
trowel
and
went
into
the
tower
raoul
him
and
every
stone
of
his
building
from
foundation
to
cornice
and
then
went
down
the
road
to
get
a
bottle
of
cognac
an
hour
later
he
came
back
breathing
out
threatenings
and
slaughter
strongly
flavoured
with
raw
spirits
prosper
was
working
quietly
on
the
top
of
the
tower
at
the
side
away
from
the
road
he
saw
nothing
until
raoul
climbing
up
by
the
ladders
on
the
inside
leaped
on
the
platform
and
rushed
at
him
like
a
crazy
lynx
he
cried
hole
to
hide
in
here
rat
i
squeeze
the
lies
out
of
he
gripped
prosper
by
the
head
thrusting
one
thumb
into
his
eye
and
pushing
him
backward
on
the
scaffolding
blinded
half
maddened
by
the
pain
prosper
thought
of
nothing
but
to
get
free
he
swung
his
long
arm
upward
and
landed
a
heavy
blow
on
raoul
face
that
dislocated
the
jaw
then
twisting
himself
downward
and
sideways
he
fell
in
toward
the
wall
raoul
plunged
forward
stumbled
let
go
his
hold
and
pitched
out
from
the
tower
arms
spread
clutching
the
air
forty
feet
straight
down
a
moment
or
was
it
an
eternity
of
horrible
silence
then
the
body
struck
the
rough
stones
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
with
a
thick
soft
dunt
and
lay
crumpled
up
among
them
without
a
groan
without
a
movement
when
the
other
men
who
had
hurried
up
the
ladders
in
terror
found
leclere
he
was
peering
over
the
edge
of
the
scaffold
wiping
the
blood
from
his
eyes
trying
to
see
down
have
killed
him
he
muttered
friend
he
is
smashed
to
death
i
am
a
murderer
let
me
go
i
must
throw
myself
down
they
had
hard
work
to
hold
him
back
as
they
forced
him
down
the
ladders
he
trembled
like
a
poplar
but
vaillantcoeur
was
not
dead
no
it
was
incredible
to
fall
forty
feet
and
not
be
killed
they
talk
of
it
yet
all
through
the
valley
of
the
lake
john
it
was
a
miracle
but
vaillantcoeur
had
broken
only
a
nose
a
and
two
ribs
for
one
like
him
that
was
but
a
bagatelle
a
good
doctor
from
chicoutimi
a
few
months
of
nursing
and
he
would
be
on
his
feet
again
almost
as
good
a
man
as
he
had
ever
been
it
was
leclere
who
put
himself
in
charge
of
this
is
my
affair
he
said
fault
it
was
not
a
fair
place
to
fight
why
did
i
strike
i
must
attend
to
this
bad
sacre
bleu
they
answered
could
you
help
it
he
forced
you
you
did
not
want
to
be
killed
that
would
be
a
little
too
he
persisted
is
my
affair
girard
you
know
my
money
is
with
the
notary
there
is
plenty
raoul
has
not
enough
perhaps
not
any
but
he
shall
want
nothing
you
understand
nothing
it
is
my
affair
all
that
he
needs
but
you
shall
not
tell
him
no
that
is
prosper
had
his
way
but
he
did
not
see
vaillantcoeur
after
he
was
carried
home
and
put
to
bed
in
his
cabin
even
if
he
had
tried
to
do
so
it
would
have
been
impossible
he
could
not
see
anybody
one
of
his
eyes
was
entirely
destroyed
the
inflammation
spread
to
the
other
and
all
through
the
autumn
he
lay
in
his
house
drifting
along
the
edge
of
blindness
while
raoul
lay
in
his
house
slowly
getting
well
the
cure
went
from
one
house
to
the
other
but
he
did
not
carry
any
messages
between
them
if
any
were
sent
one
way
they
were
not
received
and
the
other
way
none
were
sent
raoul
did
not
speak
of
prosper
and
if
one
mentioned
his
name
raoul
shut
his
mouth
and
made
no
answer
to
the
cure
of
course
it
was
a
distress
and
a
misery
to
have
a
hatred
like
this
unhealed
was
a
blot
on
the
parish
it
was
a
shame
as
well
as
a
sin
at
last
it
was
already
winter
the
day
before
christmas
the
cure
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
put
forth
one
more
great
effort
you
my
son
he
said
to
prosper
am
going
this
afternoon
to
raoul
vaillantcoeur
to
make
the
reconciliation
you
shall
give
me
a
word
to
carry
to
him
he
shall
hear
it
this
time
i
promise
you
shall
i
tell
him
what
you
have
done
for
him
how
you
have
cared
for
him
never
said
prosper
shall
not
take
that
word
from
me
it
is
nothing
it
will
make
worse
trouble
i
will
never
send
then
said
the
priest
i
tell
him
that
you
forgive
him
not
that
answered
prosper
would
be
a
foolish
word
what
would
that
mean
it
is
not
i
who
can
forgive
i
was

from
the

yourself

shall
it
be

i
promise
you
that
he
shall

will
take
with
me

notary
and
the
good
man

and
the
little
marie
antoinette

shall
hear
an
answer
what
message

slowly

tell
him
just
this
i
prosper
leclere
ask
raoul
vaillantcoeur
that
he
will
forgive
me
for
not
fighting
with
him
on
the
ground
when
he
demanded
yes
the
message
was
given
in
precisely
those
words
marie
antoinette
stood
within
the
door
bergeron
and
girard
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
the
cure
spoke
very
clearly
and
firmly
vaillantcoeur
rolled
on
his
pillow
and
turned
his
face
away
then
he
sat
up
in
bed
grunting
a
little
with
the
pain
in
his
shoulder
which
was
badly
set
his
black
eyes
snapped
like
the
eyes
of
a
wolverine
in
a
corner
he
said
never
he
is
a
coward
i
will
never
forgive
a
little
later
in
the
afternoon
when
the
rose
of
sunset
lay
on
the
snowy
hills
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
of
leclere
house
he
cried
is
there
i
see
not
very
well
by
this
light
who
is
it
is
me
said
her
cheeks
rosier
than
the
snow
outside
but
me
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
tell
me
the
rest
about
that
new
carriage
do
you
remember
iii
the
voice
in
the
canoe
behind
me
ceased
the
rain
let
up
the
slish
slish
of
the
paddle
stopped
the
canoe
swung
sideways
to
the
breeze
i
heard
the
rap
rap
rap
of
a
pipe
on
the
gunwale
and
the
quick
scratch
of
a
match
on
the
under
side
of
the
thwart
are
you
doing
ferdinand
go
to
light
the
pipe
the
story
finished
yes
but
no
i
know
not
as
you
what
did
old
girard
say
when
his
daughter
broke
her
engagement
and
married
a
man
whose
eyes
were
spoiled
said
that
leclere
could
see
well
enough
to
work
with
him
in
the
what
did
vaillantcoeur
say
when
he
lost
his
girl
said
it
was
a
cursed
shame
that
one
could
not
fight
a
blind
what
did
say
said
she
had
chosen
the
bravest
heart
in
prosper
what
did
he
say
i
know
not
he
said
it
only
to
iv
the
gentle
life
do
you
remember
that
fair
little
wood
of
silver
birches
on
the
west
branch
of
the
neversink
somewhat
below
the
place
where
the
biscuit
brook
runs
in
there
is
a
mossy
terrace
raised
a
couple
of
feet
above
the
water
of
a
long
still
pool
and
a
very
pleasant
spot
for
a
on
the
shingly
beach
below
you
and
a
plenty
of
painted
trilliums
and
yellow
violets
and
white
to
adorn
your
woodland
banquet
if
it
be
spread
in
the
month
of
may
when
mistress
nature
is
given
over
to
embroidery
it
was
there
at
contentment
corner
that
ned
mason
had
promised
to
meet
me
on
a
certain
day
for
the
noontide
lunch
and
smoke
and
talk
he
fishing
down
biscuit
brook
and
i
down
the
west
branch
until
we
came
together
at
the
rendezvous
but
he
was
late
that
day
good
old
ned
he
was
occasionally
behind
time
on
a
trout
stream
for
he
went
about
his
fishing
very
seriously
and
if
it
was
fine
the
sport
was
a
natural
occasion
of
delay
but
if
it
was
poor
he
made
it
an
occasion
to
sit
down
to
meditate
upon
the
cause
of
his
failure
and
tried
to
overcome
it
with
many
subtly
reasoned
changes
of
the
fly
which
is
a
vain
thing
to
do
but
well
adapted
to
make
one
forgetful
of
the
flight
of
time
so
i
waited
for
him
near
an
hour
and
then
ate
my
half
of
the
sandwiches
and
boiled
eggs
smoked
a
solitary
pipe
and
fell
into
a
light
sleep
at
the
foot
of
the
biggest
birch
tree
an
old
and
trusty
friend
of
mine
it
seemed
like
a
very
slight
sound
that
roused
me
the
snapping
of
a
dry
twig
in
the
thicket
or
a
gentle
splash
in
the
water
differing
in
some
indefinable
way
from
the
steady
murmur
of
the
stream
something
it
was
i
knew
not
what
that
made
me
aware
of
some
one
coming
down
the
brook
i
raised
myself
quietly
on
one
elbow
and
looked
up
through
the
trees
to
the
head
of
the
pool
will
think
that
i
have
gone
down
long
ago
i
said
to
myself
will
just
lie
here
and
watch
him
fish
through
this
pool
and
see
how
he
manages
to
spend
so
much
time
about
but
it
was
not
ned
rod
that
i
saw
poking
out
through
the
bushes
at
the
bend
in
the
brook
it
was
such
an
affair
as
i
had
never
seen
before
upon
a
trout
stream
a
majestic
weapon
at
least
sixteen
feet
long
made
in
two
pieces
neatly
spliced
together
in
the
middle
and
all
painted
a
smooth
glistening
hopeful
green
the
line
that
hung
from
the
tip
of
it
was
also
green
but
of
a
paler
more
transparent
colour
quite
thick
and
stiff
where
it
left
the
rod
but
tapering
down
towards
the
end
as
if
it
were
twisted
of
strands
of
reduced
in
number
until
at
the
hook
there
were
but
two
hairs
and
the
hook
there
was
no
disguise
about
that
it
was
an
unabashed
and
well
baited
too
gently
the
line
swayed
to
and
fro
above
the
foaming
water
at
the
head
of
the
pool
quietly
the
bait
settled
down
in
the
foam
and
ran
with
the
current
around
the
edge
of
the
deep
eddy
under
the
opposite
bank
suddenly
the
line
straightened
and
tautened
sharply
the
tip
of
the
long
green
rod
sprang
upward
and
the
fisherman
stepped
out
from
the
bushes
to
play
his
fish
where
had
i
seen
such
a
figure
before
the
dress
was
strange
and
quaint
broad
low
shoes
gray
woollen
stockings
short
brown
breeches
tied
at
the
knee
with
ribbons
a
loose
brown
coat
belted
at
the
waist
like
a
norfolk
jacket
a
wide
rolling
collar
with
a
bit
of
lace
at
the
edge
and
a
soft
felt
hat
with
a
shady
brim
it
was
a
costume
that
with
all
its
oddity
seemed
wonderfully
fit
and
familiar
and
the
face
certainly
it
was
the
face
of
an
old
friend
never
had
i
seen
a
countenance
of
more
quietness
and
kindliness
and
twinkling
good
humour
met
sir
and
a
pleasant
day
to
you
cried
the
angler
as
his
eyes
lighted
on
me
you
i
have
hold
of
a
good
fish
i
pray
you
put
that
net
under
him
and
touch
not
my
line
for
if
you
do
then
we
break
all
well
done
sir
i
thank
you
now
we
have
him
safely
landed
truly
this
is
a
lovely
one
the
best
that
i
have
taken
in
these
waters
see
how
the
belly
shines
here
as
yellow
as
a
and
there
as
white
as
a
is
not
the
hand
of
divine
wisdom
as
skilful
in
the
colouring
of
a
fish
as
in
the
painting
of
the
manifold
blossoms
that
sweeten
these
wild
forests
it
is
said
i
this
is
the
biggest
trout
that
i
have
seen
caught
in
the
upper
waters
of
the
neversink
it
is
certainly
eighteen
inches
long
and
should
weigh
close
upon
two
pounds
and
a
than
that
he
answered
i
mistake
not
but
i
observe
that
you
call
it
a
trout
to
my
mind
it
seems
more
like
a
char
as
do
all
the
fish
that
i
have
caught
in
your
stream
look
here
upon
these
curious
that
run
through
the
dark
green
of
the
back
and
these
enamellings
of
blue
and
gold
upon
the
side
note
moreover
how
bright
and
how
many
are
the
red
spots
and
how
each
one
of
them
is
encircled
with
a
ring
of
purple
truly
it
is
a
fish
of
rare
beauty
and
of
high
esteem
with
persons
of
note
i
would
gladly
know
if
it
he
as
good
to
the
taste
as
i
have
heard
it
is
even
better
i
replied
you
shall
find
if
you
will
but
try
then
a
curious
impulse
came
to
me
to
which
i
yielded
with
as
little
hesitation
or
misgiving
at
the
time
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
seem
a
stranger
in
this
part
of
the
country
sir
said
i
unless
i
am
mistaken
you
are
no
stranger
to
me
did
you
not
use
to
go
in
the
new
river
with
honest
nat
and
roe
many
years
ago
and
did
they
not
call
you
izaak
walton
his
eyes
smiled
pleasantly
at
me
and
a
little
curve
of
merriment
played
around
his
lips
is
a
secret
which
i
thought
not
to
have
been
discovered
here
he
said
since
you
have
lit
upon
it
i
will
not
deny
now
how
it
came
to
pass
that
i
was
not
astonished
nor
dismayed
at
this
i
can
not
explain
but
so
it
was
and
the
only
feeling
of
which
i
was
conscious
was
a
strong
desire
to
detain
this
visitor
as
long
as
possible
and
have
some
talk
with
him
so
i
grasped
at
the
only
expedient
that
flashed
into
my
mind
then
sir
i
said
are
most
heartily
welcome
and
i
trust
you
will
not
despise
the
only
hospitality
i
have
to
offer
if
you
will
sit
down
here
among
these
birch
trees
in
contentment
corner
i
will
give
you
half
of
a
fisherman
luncheon
and
will
cook
your
char
for
you
on
a
board
before
an
open
if
you
are
not
in
a
hurry
though
i
belong
to
a
nation
which
is
reported
to
be
curious
i
will
promise
to
trouble
you
with
no
inquisitive
questions
and
if
you
will
but
talk
to
me
at
your
will
you
shall
find
me
a
ready
so
we
made
ourselves
comfortable
on
the
shady
bank
and
while
i
busied
myself
in
splitting
the
fish
and
pinning
it
open
on
a
bit
of
board
that
i
had
found
in
a
pile
of
driftwood
and
setting
it
up
before
the
fire
to
broil
my
new
companion
entertained
me
with
the
sweetest
and
friendliest
talk
that
i
had
ever
heard
speak
without
offence
sir
he
began
was
a
word
in
your
discourse
a
moment
ago
that
seemed
strange
to
me
you
spoke
of
being
a
hurry
and
that
is
an
expression
which
is
unfamiliar
to
my
ears
but
if
it
mean
the
same
as
being
in
haste
then
i
must
tell
you
that
this
is
a
thing
which
in
my
judgment
honest
anglers
should
learn
to
forget
and
have
no
dealings
with
it
to
be
in
haste
is
to
be
in
anxiety
and
distress
of
mind
it
is
to
mistrust
providence
and
to
doubt
that
the
issue
of
all
events
is
in
wiser
hands
than
ours
it
is
to
disturb
the
course
of
nature
and
put
overmuch
confidence
in
the
importance
of
our
own
endeavours
how
much
of
the
evil
that
is
in
the
world
cometh
from
this
plaguy
habit
of
being
in
haste
the
haste
to
get
riches
the
haste
to
climb
upon
some
pinnacle
of
worldly
renown
the
haste
to
resolve
mysteries
from
these
various
kinds
of
haste
are
begotten
no
small
part
of
the
miseries
and
afflictions
whereby
the
children
of
men
are
tormented
such
as
quarrels
and
strifes
among
those
who
would
one
another
in
business
envyings
and
jealousies
among
those
who
would
outshine
one
another
in
rich
apparel
and
costly
equipage
bloody
rebellions
and
cruel
wars
among
those
who
would
obtain
power
over
their
cloudy
disputations
and
bitter
controversies
among
those
who
would
fain
leave
no
room
for
modest
ignorance
and
lowly
faith
among
the
secrets
of
religion
and
by
all
these
miseries
of
haste
the
heart
grows
weary
and
is
made
weak
and
dull
or
else
hard
and
angry
while
it
dwelleth
in
the
midst
of
them
let
me
tell
you
that
an
angler
occupation
is
a
good
cure
for
these
evils
if
for
no
other
reason
because
it
gently
dissuadeth
us
from
haste
and
leadeth
us
away
from
feverish
anxieties
into
those
ways
which
are
pleasantness
and
those
paths
which
are
peace
for
an
angler
can
not
force
his
fortune
by
eagerness
nor
better
it
by
discontent
he
must
wait
upon
the
weather
and
the
height
of
the
water
and
the
hunger
of
the
fish
and
many
other
accidents
of
which
he
has
no
control
if
he
would
angle
well
he
must
not
be
in
haste
and
if
he
be
in
haste
he
will
do
well
to
unlearn
it
by
angling
for
i
think
there
is
no
surer
method
fair
tree
that
shadows
us
from
the
sun
hath
grown
many
years
in
its
place
without
more
unhappiness
than
the
loss
of
its
leaves
in
winter
which
the
succeeding
season
doth
generously
repair
and
shall
we
be
less
contented
in
the
place
where
god
hath
planted
us
or
shall
there
go
less
time
to
the
making
of
a
man
than
to
the
growth
of
a
tree
this
stream
floweth
wimpling
and
laughing
down
to
the
great
sea
which
it
knoweth
not
yet
it
doth
not
fret
because
the
future
is
hidden
and
doubtless
it
were
wise
in
us
to
accept
the
mysteries
of
life
as
cheerfully
and
go
forward
with
a
merry
heart
considering
that
we
know
enough
to
make
us
happy
and
keep
us
honest
for
a
man
should
be
well
content
if
he
can
see
so
far
ahead
of
him
as
the
next
bend
in
the
stream
what
lies
beyond
let
him
trust
in
the
hand
of
god
as
concerning
riches
wherein
should
you
and
i
be
happier
this
pleasant
afternoon
of
may
had
we
all
the
gold
in
croesus
his
coffers
would
the
sun
shine
for
us
more
bravely
or
the
flowers
give
forth
a
sweeter
breath
or
yonder
warbling
vireo
hidden
in
her
leafy
choir
send
down
more
pure
and
musical
descants
sweetly
attuned
by
natural
magic
to
woo
and
win
our
thoughts
from
vanity
and
hot
desires
into
a
harmony
with
the
tranquil
thoughts
of
god
and
as
for
fame
and
power
trust
me
sir
i
have
seen
too
many
men
in
my
time
that
lived
very
unhappily
though
their
names
were
upon
all
lips
and
died
very
sadly
though
their
power
was
felt
in
many
lands
too
many
of
these
great
ones
have
i
seen
that
spent
their
days
in
disquietude
and
ended
them
in
sorrow
to
make
me
envy
their
conditions
or
hasten
to
rival
them
nor
do
i
think
that
by
all
their
perturbations
and
fightings
and
runnings
to
and
fro
the
world
hath
been
much
bettered
or
even
greatly
changed
the
colour
and
complexion
of
mortal
life
in
all
things
that
are
essential
remain
the
same
under
cromwell
or
under
charles
the
goodness
and
mercy
of
god
are
still
over
all
his
works
whether
presbytery
or
episcopacy
be
set
up
as
his
interpreter
very
quietly
and
peacefully
have
i
lived
under
several
polities
civil
and
ecclesiastical
and
under
all
there
was
room
enough
to
do
my
duty
and
love
my
friends
and
go
and
let
me
tell
you
sir
that
in
the
state
wherein
i
now
find
myself
though
there
are
many
things
of
which
i
may
not
speak
to
you
yet
one
thing
is
clear
if
i
had
made
haste
in
my
mortal
concerns
i
should
not
have
saved
time
but
lost
it
for
all
our
affairs
are
under
one
sure
dominion
which
moveth
them
forward
to
their
concordant
end
wherefore
that
believeth
shall
not
make
haste
and
above
all
not
when
he
goeth
tell
me
i
pray
you
is
not
this
char
cooked
yet
methinks
the
time
is
somewhat
overlong
for
the
roasting
the
fragrant
smell
of
the
cookery
gives
me
an
eagerness
to
taste
this
new
dish
not
that
i
am
in
haste
but
it
is
done
and
well
done
too
marry
the
flesh
of
this
fish
is
as
red
as
and
as
sweet
as
if
he
had
fed
on
nothing
else
the
flavour
of
smoke
from
the
fire
is
but
slight
and
it
takes
nothing
from
the
perfection
of
the
dish
but
rather
adds
to
it
being
clean
and
delicate
i
like
not
these
french
cooks
who
make
all
dishes
in
disguise
and
set
them
forth
with
strange
foreign
savours
like
a
masquerade
give
me
my
food
in
its
native
dress
even
though
it
be
a
little
dry
if
we
had
but
a
cup
of
sack
now
or
a
glass
of
good
ale
and
a
pipeful
of
tobacco
you
have
an
abundance
of
the
fragrant
weed
in
your
pouch
sir
i
thank
you
very
heartily
you
entertain
me
like
a
prince
not
like
king
james
be
it
understood
who
despised
tobacco
and
called
it
a
image
and
pattern
of
hell
nor
like
the
czar
of
russia
who
commanded
that
all
who
used
it
should
have
their
noses
cut
off
but
like
good
queen
bess
of
glorious
memory
who
disdained
not
the
incense
of
the
pipe
and
some
say
she
used
one
herself
though
for
my
part
i
think
the
custom
of
smoking
one
that
is
more
fitting
for
men
whose
frailty
and
need
of
comfort
are
well
known
than
for
that
fairer
sex
whose
innocent
and
virgin
spirits
stand
less
in
want
of
creature
consolations
come
let
us
not
trouble
our
enjoyment
with
careful
discrimination
of
others
scruples
your
tobacco
is
rarely
good
i
warrant
it
comes
from
that
province
of
virginia
which
was
named
for
the
virgin
queen
and
while
we
smoke
together
let
me
call
you
for
this
hour
my
scholar
and
so
i
will
give
you
four
choice
rules
for
the
attainment
of
that
unhastened
quietude
of
mind
whereof
we
did
lately
discourse
you
shall
learn
to
desire
nothing
in
the
world
so
much
but
that
you
can
be
happy
without
it
you
shall
seek
that
which
you
desire
only
by
such
means
as
are
fair
and
lawful
and
this
will
leave
you
without
bitterness
towards
men
or
shame
before
god
you
shall
take
pleasure
in
the
time
while
you
are
seeking
even
though
you
obtain
not
immediately
that
which
you
seek
for
the
purpose
of
a
journey
is
not
only
to
arrive
at
the
goal
but
also
to
find
enjoyment
by
the
way
when
you
attain
that
which
you
have
desired
you
shall
think
more
of
the
kindness
of
your
fortune
than
of
the
greatness
of
your
skill
this
will
make
you
grateful
and
ready
to
share
with
others
that
which
providence
hath
bestowed
upon
you
and
truly
this
is
both
reasonable
and
profitable
for
it
is
but
little
that
any
of
us
would
catch
in
this
world
were
not
our
luck
better
than
our
deserts
to
these
four
rules
i
will
add
yet
another
fifth
when
you
smoke
your
pipe
with
a
good
conscience
trouble
not
yourself
because
there
are
men
in
the
world
who
will
find
fault
with
you
for
so
doing
if
you
wait
for
a
pleasure
at
which
no
soul
hath
ever
girded
you
will
wait
long
and
go
through
life
with
a
sad
and
anxious
mind
but
i
think
that
god
is
best
pleased
with
us
when
we
give
little
heed
to
scoffers
and
enjoy
his
gifts
with
thankfulness
and
an
easy
heart
scholar
i
have
almost
tired
myself
and
i
fear
more
than
almost
tired
you
but
this
pipe
is
nearly
burned
out
and
the
few
short
whiffs
that
are
left
in
it
shall
put
a
period
to
my
too
long
discourse
let
me
tell
you
then
that
there
be
some
men
in
the
world
who
hold
not
with
these
my
opinions
they
profess
that
a
life
of
contention
and
noise
and
public
turmoil
is
far
higher
than
a
life
of
quiet
work
and
meditation
and
so
far
as
they
follow
their
own
choice
honestly
and
with
a
pure
mind
i
doubt
not
that
it
is
as
good
for
them
as
mine
is
for
me
and
i
am
well
pleased
that
every
man
do
enjoy
his
own
opinion
but
so
far
as
they
have
spoken
ill
of
me
and
my
opinions
i
do
hold
it
a
thing
of
little
consequence
except
that
i
am
sorry
that
they
have
thereby
embittered
their
own
hearts
this
is
the
punishment
of
men
who
malign
and
revile
those
that
differ
from
them
in
religion
or
prefer
another
way
of
living
their
revilings
by
so
much
as
they
spend
their
wit
and
labour
to
make
them
shrewd
and
bitter
do
draw
all
the
sweet
and
wholesome
sap
out
of
their
lives
and
turn
it
into
poison
and
so
they
become
vessels
of
mockery
and
wrath
remembered
chiefly
for
the
evil
things
that
they
have
said
with
cleverness
be
sure
of
this
scholar
the
more
a
man
giveth
himself
to
hatred
in
this
world
the
more
will
he
find
to
hate
but
let
us
rather
give
ourselves
to
charity
and
if
we
have
enemies
and
what
honest
man
hath
them
not
let
them
be
ours
since
they
must
but
let
us
not
be
theirs
since
we
know
better
was
one
franck
a
trooper
of
cromwell
who
wrote
ill
of
me
saying
that
i
neither
understood
the
subjects
whereof
i
discoursed
nor
believed
the
things
that
i
said
being
both
silly
and
pretentious
it
would
have
been
a
pity
if
it
had
been
true
there
was
also
one
leigh
hunt
a
maker
of
many
books
who
used
one
day
a
bottle
of
ink
whereof
the
gall
was
transfused
into
his
blood
so
that
he
wrote
many
hard
words
of
me
setting
forth
selfishness
and
cruelty
and
hypocrisy
as
if
they
were
qualities
of
my
disposition
god
knew
even
then
whether
these
things
were
true
of
me
and
if
they
were
not
true
it
would
have
been
a
pity
to
have
answered
them
but
it
would
have
been
still
more
a
pity
to
be
angered
by
them
but
since
that
time
master
hunt
and
i
have
met
each
other
yes
and
master
franck
too
and
we
have
come
very
happily
to
a
better
understanding
me
scholar
it
is
the
part
of
wisdom
to
spend
little
of
your
time
upon
the
things
that
vex
and
anger
you
and
much
of
your
time
upon
the
things
that
bring
you
quietness
and
confidence
and
good
cheer
a
friend
made
is
better
than
an
enemy
punished
there
is
more
of
god
in
the
peaceable
beauty
of
this
little
than
in
all
the
angry
disputations
of
the
sects
we
are
nearer
heaven
when
we
listen
to
the
birds
than
when
we
quarrel
with
our
i
am
sure
that
none
can
enter
into
the
spirit
of
christ
his
evangel
save
those
who
willingly
follow
his
invitation
when
he
says
ye
yourselves
apart
into
a
lonely
place
and
rest
a
while
for
since
his
blessed
kingdom
was
first
established
in
the
green
fields
by
the
lakeside
with
humble
fishermen
for
its
subjects
the
easiest
way
into
it
hath
ever
been
through
the
of
a
lowly
and
grateful
fellowship
with
nature
he
that
feels
not
the
beauty
and
blessedness
and
peace
of
the
woods
and
meadows
that
god
hath
bedecked
with
flowers
for
him
even
while
he
is
yet
a
sinner
how
shall
he
learn
to
enjoy
the
unfading
bloom
of
the
celestial
country
if
he
ever
become
a
saint
no
sir
he
that
departeth
out
of
this
world
without
perceiving
that
it
is
fair
and
full
of
innocent
sweetness
hath
done
little
honour
to
the
miracles
of
divine
beneficence
and
though
by
mercy
he
may
obtain
an
entrance
to
heaven
it
will
be
a
strange
place
to
him
and
though
he
have
studied
all
that
is
written
in
men
books
of
divinity
yet
because
he
hath
left
the
book
of
nature
unturned
he
will
have
much
to
learn
and
much
to
forget
do
you
think
that
to
be
blind
to
the
beauties
of
earth
prepareth
the
heart
to
behold
the
glories
of
heaven
nay
scholar
i
know
that
you
are
not
of
that
opinion
but
i
can
tell
you
another
thing
which
perhaps
you
knew
not
the
heart
that
is
blest
with
the
glories
of
heaven
ceaseth
not
to
remember
and
to
love
the
beauties
of
this
world
and
of
this
love
i
am
certain
because
i
feel
it
and
glad
because
it
is
a
great
blessing
are
two
sorts
of
seeds
sown
in
our
remembrance
by
what
we
call
the
hand
of
fortune
the
fruits
of
which
do
not
wither
but
grow
sweeter
forever
and
ever
the
first
is
the
seed
of
innocent
pleasures
received
in
gratitude
and
enjoyed
with
good
companions
of
which
pleasures
we
never
grow
weary
of
thinking
because
they
have
enriched
our
hearts
the
second
is
the
seed
of
pure
and
gentle
sorrows
borne
in
submission
and
with
faithful
love
and
these
also
we
never
forget
but
we
come
to
cherish
them
with
gladness
instead
of
grief
because
we
see
them
changed
into
everlasting
joys
and
how
this
may
be
i
can
not
tell
you
now
for
you
would
not
understand
me
but
that
it
is
so
believe
me
for
if
you
believe
you
shall
one
day
see
it
yourself
come
now
our
friendly
pipes
are
long
since
burned
out
hark
how
sweetly
the
tawny
thrush
in
yonder
thicket
touches
her
silver
harp
for
the
evening
hymn
i
will
follow
the
stream
downward
but
do
you
tarry
here
until
the
friend
comes
for
whom
you
were
waiting
i
think
we
shall
all
three
meet
one
another
somewhere
after
i
watched
the
gray
hat
and
the
old
brown
coat
and
long
green
rod
disappear
among
the
trees
around
the
curve
of
the
stream
then
voice
sounded
in
my
ears
and
i
saw
him
standing
above
me
laughing
old
man
he
said
a
sound
sleeper
i
hope
you
had
good
luck
and
pleasant
a
friend
of
justice
i
it
was
the
black
patch
over
his
left
eye
that
made
all
the
trouble
in
reality
he
was
of
a
disposition
most
peaceful
and
propitiating
a
friend
of
justice
and
fair
dealing
strongly
inclined
to
a
domestic
life
and
capable
of
extreme
devotion
he
had
a
vivid
sense
of
righteousness
it
is
true
and
any
violation
of
it
was
apt
to
heat
his
indignation
to
the
when
this
occurred
he
was
strong
in
the
back
stiff
in
the
neck
and
fearless
of
consequences
but
he
was
always
open
to
friendly
overtures
and
ready
to
make
peace
with
honour
singularly
responsive
to
every
touch
of
kindness
desirous
of
affection
secretly
hungry
for
caresses
he
had
a
heart
framed
for
love
and
tranquillity
but
nature
saw
fit
to
put
a
black
patch
over
his
left
eye
wherefore
his
days
were
passed
in
the
midst
of
conflict
and
he
lived
the
strenuous
life
how
this
sinister
mark
came
to
him
he
never
knew
indeed
it
is
not
likely
that
he
had
any
idea
of
the
part
that
it
played
in
his
career
the
attitude
that
the
world
took
toward
him
from
the
beginning
an
attitude
of
aggressive
mistrust
the
role
that
he
was
expected
and
practically
forced
to
assume
in
the
drama
of
existence
the
role
of
a
hero
of
interminable
strife
must
have
seemed
to
him
altogether
mysterious
and
somewhat
absurd
but
his
part
was
fixed
by
the
black
patch
it
gave
him
an
aspect
so
truculent
and
forbidding
that
all
the
elements
of
warfare
gathered
around
him
as
hornets
around
a
sugar
barrel
and
his
appearance
in
public
was
like
the
raising
of
a
flag
for
battle
see
that
pichou
said
macintosh
the
hudson
bay
agent
at
mingan
see
yon
big
deevil
the
savages
call
him
pichou
because
he
ugly
as
a
lynx
comme
un
pichou
best
and
the
gurliest
tyke
on
the
north
shore
only
two
years
old
and
he
can
lead
a
team
already
but
man
he
just
daft
for
the
fighting
fought
his
mother
when
he
was
a
pup
and
lamed
her
for
life
fought
two
of
his
brothers
and
nigh
killed
both
every
dog
in
the
place
has
a
grudge
at
him
and
hell
loose
as
oft
as
he
takes
a
walk
i
loath
to
part
with
him
but
i
be
selling
him
gladly
for
fifty
dollars
to
any
man
that
wants
a
good
eh
and
a
bit
every
pichou
had
heard
his
name
and
came
trotting
up
to
the
corner
of
the
store
where
macintosh
was
talking
with
old
grant
the
chief
factor
who
was
on
a
tour
of
inspection
along
the
north
shore
and
dan
scott
the
agent
from
seven
islands
who
had
brought
the
chief
down
in
his
chaloupe
pichou
did
not
understand
what
his
master
had
been
saying
about
him
but
he
thought
he
was
called
and
he
had
a
sense
of
duty
and
besides
he
was
wishful
to
show
proper
courtesy
to
and
respectable
strangers
he
was
a
great
dog
thirty
inches
high
at
the
shoulder
with
straight
sinewy
legs
and
covered
with
thick
wavy
hair
from
the
tips
of
his
short
ears
to
the
end
of
his
bushy
tail
all
except
the
left
side
of
his
face
that
was
black
from
ear
to
nose
and
in
the
centre
of
this
his
eye
gleamed
like
fire
what
did
pichou
know
about
that
ominous
sign
no
one
had
ever
told
him
he
had
no
he
ran
up
to
the
porch
where
the
men
were
sitting
as
innocent
as
a
scholar
coming
to
the
superintendent
desk
to
receive
a
prize
but
when
old
grant
who
had
grown
pursy
and
nervous
from
long
living
on
the
fat
of
the
land
at
ottawa
saw
the
black
patch
and
the
gleaming
eye
he
anticipated
evil
so
he
hitched
one
foot
up
on
the
porch
crying
out
and
with
the
other
foot
he
planted
a
kick
on
the
side
of
the
dog
head
pichou
had
not
been
shaken
by
high
living
they
acted
with
absolute
precision
and
without
a
tremor
his
sense
of
justice
was
automatic
and
his
teeth
were
fixed
through
the
leg
of
the
chief
factor
boot
just
below
the
calf
for
two
minutes
there
was
a
small
chaos
in
the
post
of
the
honourable
hudson
bay
company
at
mingan
grant
howled
bloody
murder
macintosh
swore
in
three
languages
and
yelled
for
his
three
indians
and
two
wielded
sticks
and
but
order
did
not
arrive
until
dan
scott
knocked
the
burning
embers
from
his
big
pipe
on
the
end
of
the
dog
nose
pichou
gasped
let
go
his
grip
shook
his
head
and
loped
back
to
his
quarters
behind
the
barn
bruised
blistered
and
intolerably
perplexed
by
the
mystery
of
life
as
he
lay
on
the
sand
licking
his
wounds
he
remembered
many
strange
things
first
of
all
there
was
the
trouble
with
his
mother
she
was
a
labrador
husky
dirty
yellowish
gray
with
bristling
neck
sharp
fangs
and
green
eyes
like
a
wolf
her
name
was
babette
she
had
a
fiendish
temper
but
no
courage
his
father
was
supposed
to
be
a
huge
black
and
white
newfoundland
that
came
over
in
a
schooner
from
miquelon
perhaps
it
was
from
him
that
the
black
patch
was
inherited
and
perhaps
there
were
other
things
in
the
inheritance
too
which
came
from
this
nobler
strain
of
blood
pichon
unwillingness
to
howl
with
the
other
dogs
when
they
made
night
hideous
his
silent
dignified
ways
his
sense
of
fair
play
his
love
of
the
water
his
longing
for
human
society
and
friendship
but
all
this
was
beyond
pichou
horizon
though
it
was
within
his
nature
he
remembered
only
that
babette
had
taken
a
hate
for
him
almost
from
the
first
and
had
always
treated
him
worse
than
his
brothers
she
would
have
starved
him
if
she
could
once
when
he
was
half
grown
she
fell
upon
him
for
some
small
offence
and
tried
to
throttle
him
the
rest
of
the
pack
looked
on
snarling
and
slavering
he
caught
babette
by
the
and
broke
the
bone
she
hobbled
away
shrieking
what
else
could
he
do
must
a
dog
let
himself
be
killed
by
his
mother
as
for
his
brothers
was
it
fair
that
two
of
them
should
fall
foul
of
him
about
the
rabbit
which
he
had
tracked
and
caught
and
killed
he
would
have
shared
it
with
them
if
they
had
asked
him
for
they
ran
behind
him
on
the
trail
but
when
they
both
set
their
teeth
in
his
neck
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
lay
them
both
out
which
he
did
afterward
he
was
willing
enough
to
make
friends
but
they
bristled
and
cursed
whenever
he
came
near
them
it
was
the
same
with
everybody
if
he
went
out
for
a
walk
on
the
beach
vigneau
dogs
or
simard
dogs
regarded
it
as
an
insult
and
there
was
a
fight
men
picked
up
sticks
or
showed
him
the
of
their
when
he
made
friendly
approaches
with
the
children
it
was
different
they
seemed
to
like
him
a
little
but
never
did
he
follow
one
of
them
that
a
mother
did
not
call
from
the
marie
come
away
quick
that
bad
dog
will
bite
you
once
when
he
ran
down
to
the
shore
to
watch
the
boat
coming
in
from
the
the
purser
had
refused
to
let
the
boat
go
to
land
and
called
out
macintosh
you
git
no
malle
dis
trip
eef
you
not
call
avay
dat
true
the
minganites
seemed
to
take
a
certain
kind
of
pride
in
his
reputation
they
had
brought
chouart
big
brown
dog
gripette
down
from
the
sheldrake
to
meet
him
and
after
the
meeting
was
over
and
gripette
had
been
revived
with
a
bucket
of
water
everybody
except
chouart
appeared
to
be
in
good
humour
the
purser
of
the
steamer
had
gone
to
the
trouble
of
introducing
a
famous
from
quebec
on
the
trip
after
that
on
which
he
had
given
such
a
hostile
opinion
of
pichon
the
bulldog
intentions
were
unmistakable
he
expressed
them
the
moment
he
touched
the
beach
and
when
they
carried
him
back
to
the
boat
on
a
many
flattering
words
were
spoken
about
pichou
he
was
not
insensible
to
them
but
these
tributes
to
his
prowess
were
not
what
he
really
wanted
his
secret
desire
was
for
tokens
of
affection
his
position
was
honourable
but
it
was
intolerably
lonely
and
full
of
trouble
he
sought
peace
and
he
found
fights
while
he
meditated
dimly
on
these
things
patiently
trying
to
get
the
ashes
of
dan
scott
pipe
out
of
his
nose
his
heart
was
cast
down
and
his
spirit
was
disquieted
within
him
was
ever
a
decent
dog
so
mishandled
before
kicked
for
nothing
by
a
fat
stranger
and
then
beaten
by
his
own
master
in
the
of
the
post
grant
was
slowly
and
reluctantly
allowing
himself
to
be
convinced
that
his
injuries
were
not
fatal
during
this
process
considerable
scotch
whiskey
was
consumed
and
there
was
much
conversation
about
the
viciousness
of
dogs
grant
insisted
that
pichou
was
mad
and
had
a
devil
macintosh
admitted
the
devil
but
firmly
denied
the
madness
the
question
was
whether
the
dog
should
be
killed
or
not
and
over
this
point
there
was
like
to
be
more
bloodshed
until
dan
scott
made
his
contribution
to
the
argument
you
shoot
him
how
can
you
tell
whether
he
is
mad
or
not
i
give
thirty
dollars
for
him
and
take
him
you
do
said
grant
sail
alone
and
i
wait
for
the
steamer
never
a
step
will
i
go
in
the
boat
with
the
crazy
brute
that
bit
yourself
said
dan
scott
kicked
before
he
at
daybreak
he
whistled
the
dog
down
to
the
chaloupe
hoisted
sail
and
bore
away
for
seven
islands
there
was
a
secret
bond
of
sympathy
between
the
two
companions
on
that
voyage
in
an
open
boat
neither
of
them
realized
what
it
was
but
still
it
was
there
dan
scott
knew
what
it
meant
to
stand
alone
to
face
a
small
hostile
world
to
have
a
surfeit
of
fighting
the
station
of
seven
islands
was
the
hardest
in
all
the
district
of
the
ancient
postes
du
roi
the
indians
were
surly
and
crafty
they
knew
all
the
tricks
of
the
they
killed
out
of
season
and
understood
how
to
make
a
rusty
pelt
look
black
the
former
agent
had
accommodated
himself
to
his
customers
he
had
no
objection
to
shutting
one
of
his
eyes
so
long
as
the
other
could
see
a
chance
of
doing
a
stroke
of
business
for
himself
he
also
had
a
convenient
weakness
in
the
sense
of
smell
when
there
was
an
old
stock
of
pork
to
work
off
on
the
savages
but
all
of
dan
senses
were
strong
especially
his
sense
of
justice
and
he
came
into
the
post
resolved
to
play
a
straight
game
with
both
hands
toward
the
indians
and
toward
the
honourable
b
company
the
immediate
results
were
reproofs
from
ottawa
and
revilings
from
seven
islands
furthermore
the
free
traders
were
against
him
because
he
objected
to
their
selling
rum
to
the
savages
it
must
be
confessed
that
dan
scott
had
a
way
with
him
that
looked
pugnacious
he
was
quick
in
his
motions
and
carried
his
shoulders
well
thrown
back
his
voice
was
heavy
he
used
short
words
and
few
of
them
his
eyebrow
were
thick
and
they
met
over
his
nose
then
there
was
a
broad
white
scar
at
one
corner
of
his
mouth
his
appearance
was
not
prepossessing
but
at
heart
he
was
a
philanthropist
and
a
sentimentalist
he
thirsted
for
gratitude
and
affection
on
a
just
basis
he
had
studied
for
eighteen
months
in
the
medical
school
at
montreal
and
his
chief
delight
was
to
practise
gratuitously
among
the
sick
and
wounded
of
the
neighbourhood
his
ambition
for
seven
islands
was
to
make
it
a
northern
suburb
of
paradise
and
for
himself
to
become
a
physician
up
to
this
time
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
have
to
break
more
bones
than
he
could
set
and
the
closest
connection
of
seven
islands
appeared
to
be
with
purgatory
first
there
had
been
a
question
of
suzerainty
between
dan
scott
and
the
local
representative
of
the
astor
family
a
big
descendant
of
a
who
was
the
virtual
chief
of
the
indians
hunting
on
the
ste
marguerite
settled
by
arguments
then
there
was
a
controversy
with
napoleon
bouchard
about
the
right
to
put
a
on
a
certain
part
of
the
beach
settled
with
a
stick
after
napoleon
had
drawn
a
knife
then
there
was
a
running
warfare
with
virgile
and
ovide
boulianne
the
free
traders
who
were
his
rivals
in
dealing
with
the
indians
for
their
peltry
still
unsettled
after
this
fashion
the
record
of
his
relations
with
his
at
seven
islands
was
made
up
he
had
their
respect
but
not
their
affection
he
was
the
only
protestant
the
only
the
most
intelligent
man
as
well
as
the
hardest
hitter
in
the
place
and
he
was
very
lonely
perhaps
it
was
this
that
made
him
take
a
fancy
to
pichou
their
positions
in
the
world
were
not
unlike
he
was
not
the
first
man
who
has
wanted
sympathy
and
found
it
in
a
dog
alone
together
in
the
same
boat
they
made
friends
with
each
other
easily
at
first
the
remembrance
of
the
hot
pipe
left
a
little
suspicion
in
pichou
mind
but
this
was
removed
by
a
handsome
apology
in
the
shape
of
a
chunk
of
bread
and
a
slice
of
meat
from
dan
scott
lunch
after
this
they
got
on
together
finely
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
pichou
had
ever
spent
hours
away
from
other
dogs
it
was
also
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
treated
like
a
gentleman
all
that
was
best
in
him
responded
to
the
treatment
he
could
not
have
been
more
quiet
and
steady
in
the
boat
if
he
had
been
brought
up
to
a
seafaring
life
when
dan
scott
called
him
and
patted
him
on
the
head
the
dog
looked
up
in
the
man
face
as
if
he
had
found
his
god
and
the
man
looking
down
into
the
eye
that
was
not
disfigured
by
the
black
patch
saw
something
that
he
had
been
seeking
for
a
long
time
all
day
the
wind
was
fair
and
strong
from
the
southeast
the
chaloupe
ran
swiftly
along
the
coast
past
the
broad
mouth
of
the
river
with
its
cluster
of
white
cottages
past
the
bay
of
the
river
magpie
with
its
big
past
the
cliffs
of
and
the
turbulent
rocky
shores
of
the
sheldrake
past
the
silver
cascade
of
the
and
the
mist
of
the
hidden
fall
of
the
riviere
manitou
past
the
long
desolate
ridges
of
cap
cormorant
where
at
sunset
the
wind
began
to
droop
away
and
the
tide
was
contrary
so
the
chaloupe
felt
its
way
cautiously
toward
the
corner
of
the
coast
where
the
little
comes
tumbling
in
among
the
brown
rocks
and
found
a
haven
for
the
night
in
the
mouth
of
the
river
there
was
only
one
human
in
sight
as
far
as
the
eye
could
sweep
range
after
range
of
uninhabitable
hills
covered
with
the
skeletons
of
dead
forests
ledge
after
ledge
of
granite
thrust
out
like
fangs
into
the
foaming
waves
of
the
gulf
nature
with
her
teeth
bare
and
her
lips
scarred
this
was
the
landscape
and
in
the
midst
of
it
on
a
low
hill
above
the
murmuring
river
surrounded
by
the
blanched
trunks
of
fallen
trees
and
the
blackened
debris
of
wood
and
moss
a
small
square
palisade
of
spruce
and
a
patch
of
the
bright
green
leaves
and
white
flowers
of
the
dwarf
cornel
lavishing
their
beauty
on
a
lonely
grave
this
was
the
only
habitation
in
sight
the
last
home
of
the
englishman
jack
chisholm
whose
story
has
yet
to
be
told
in
the
shelter
of
this
hill
dan
scott
cooked
his
supper
and
shared
it
with
pichou
when
night
was
dark
he
rolled
himself
in
his
blanket
and
slept
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
with
the
dog
at
his
side
their
friendship
was
sealed
the
next
morning
the
weather
was
squally
and
full
of
sudden
anger
they
crept
out
with
difficulty
through
the
long
rollers
that
barred
the
tiny
harbour
and
beat
their
way
along
the
coast
at
moisie
they
must
run
far
out
into
the
gulf
to
avoid
the
treacherous
shoals
and
to
pass
beyond
the
furious
race
of
billows
that
poured
from
the
great
river
for
miles
into
the
sea
then
they
turned
and
made
for
the
group
of
mountains
and
scattered
rocks
that
nature
in
some
freak
of
fury
had
thrown
into
the
throat
of
seven
islands
bay
that
was
a
difficult
passage
the
black
shores
were
swept
by
headlong
tides
tusks
of
granite
tore
the
waves
baffled
and
perplexed
the
wind
flapped
and
whirled
among
the
cliffs
through
all
this
the
little
boat
buffeted
bravely
on
till
she
reached
the
point
of
the
gran
boule
then
a
strange
thing
happened
the
water
was
lumpy
the
evening
was
growing
thick
a
swirl
of
the
tide
and
a
shift
of
the
wind
caught
the
chaloupe
and
swung
her
suddenly
around
the
mainsail
jibed
and
before
he
knew
how
it
happened
dan
scott
was
overboard
he
could
swim
but
clumsily
the
water
blinded
him
choked
him
dragged
him
down
then
he
felt
pichou
gripping
him
by
the
shoulder
buoying
him
up
swimming
mightily
toward
the
chaloupe
which
hung
trembling
in
the
wind
a
few
yards
away
at
last
they
reached
it
and
the
man
climbed
over
the
stern
and
pulled
the
dog
after
him
dan
scott
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
shivering
dazed
until
he
felt
the
cold
nose
and
warm
breath
against
his
cheek
he
flung
his
arm
around
pichon
neck
said
you
were
mad
god
if
more
men
were
mad
like
you
ii
pichou
work
at
seven
islands
was
cut
out
for
him
on
a
generous
scale
it
is
true
that
at
first
he
had
no
regular
canine
labour
to
perform
for
it
was
summer
seven
months
of
the
year
on
the
north
shore
a
occupation
is
gone
he
is
the
idlest
creature
in
the
universe
but
pichou
being
a
had
to
win
his
footing
in
the
community
and
that
was
no
light
task
with
the
humans
it
was
comparatively
easy
at
the
outset
they
mistrusted
him
on
account
of
his
looks
virgile
boulianne
asked
did
you
buy
such
an
ugly
dog
ovide
who
was
the
wit
of
the
family
said
suppose
scott
got
a
present
for
taking
a
good
dog
said
dan
scott
him
well
and
he
treat
you
well
kick
him
and
i
kick
then
he
told
what
had
happened
off
the
point
of
gran
boule
the
village
decided
to
accept
pichou
at
his
master
valuation
moderate
friendliness
with
precautions
was
shown
toward
him
by
everybody
except
napoleon
bouchard
whose
distrust
was
permanent
and
took
the
form
of
a
stick
he
was
a
fat
fussy
man
fat
people
seemed
to
have
no
affinity
for
pichou
but
while
the
relations
with
the
humans
of
seven
islands
were
soon
established
on
a
fair
footing
with
the
canines
pichou
had
a
very
different
affair
they
were
not
willing
to
accept
any
recommendations
as
to
character
they
judged
for
themselves
and
they
judged
by
appearances
and
their
judgment
was
utterly
hostile
to
pichou
they
decided
that
he
was
a
proud
dog
a
fierce
dog
a
bad
dog
a
fighter
he
must
do
one
of
two
things
stay
at
home
in
the
yard
of
the
honourable
b
company
which
is
a
thing
that
no
dog
would
do
in
the
when
heads
are
strewn
along
the
beach
or
fight
his
way
from
one
end
of
the
village
to
the
other
which
pichou
promptly
did
leaving
enemies
behind
every
fence
huskies
never
forget
a
grudge
they
are
malignant
to
the
core
hatred
is
the
wine
of
cowardly
hearts
this
is
as
true
of
dogs
as
it
is
of
men
then
pichou
having
settled
his
foreign
relations
turned
his
attention
to
matters
at
home
there
were
four
other
dogs
in
dan
scott
team
they
did
not
want
pichou
for
a
leader
and
he
knew
it
they
were
bitter
with
jealousy
the
black
patch
was
loathsome
to
them
they
treated
him
disrespectfully
insultingly
grossly
affairs
came
to
a
head
when
pecan
a
rusty
gray
dog
who
had
great
ambitions
and
little
sense
disputed
pichou
tenure
of
a
certain
dan
scott
looked
on
placidly
while
the
dispute
was
terminated
then
he
washed
the
blood
and
sand
from
the
gashes
on
pecan
shoulder
and
patted
pichou
on
the
head
dog
he
said
the
there
was
no
further
question
about
pichou
leadership
of
the
team
but
the
obedience
of
his
followers
was
unwilling
and
sullen
there
was
no
love
in
it
imagine
an
english
captain
with
a
boer
company
campaigning
in
the
ashantee
country
and
you
will
have
a
fair
idea
of
position
at
seven
islands
he
did
not
shrink
from
its
responsibilities
there
were
certain
reforms
in
the
community
which
seemed
to
him
of
vital
importance
and
he
put
them
through
first
of
all
he
made
up
his
mind
that
there
ought
to
be
peace
and
order
on
the
village
street
in
the
yards
of
the
houses
that
were
strung
along
it
there
should
be
home
rule
and
every
dog
should
deal
with
trespassers
as
he
saw
fit
also
on
the
beach
and
around
the
and
under
the
racks
where
the
cod
were
drying
the
right
of
the
strong
jaw
should
prevail
and
differences
of
opinion
should
be
adjusted
in
the
way
but
on
the
sandy
road
bordered
with
a
broken
which
ran
between
the
houses
and
the
beach
courtesy
and
propriety
must
be
observed
visitors
walked
there
children
played
there
it
was
the
general
promenade
it
must
be
kept
peaceful
and
decent
this
was
the
first
law
of
the
dogs
of
seven
islands
if
two
dogs
quarrel
on
the
street
they
must
go
elsewhere
to
settle
it
it
was
highly
unpopular
but
pichou
enforced
it
with
his
teeth
the
second
law
was
equally
unpopular
no
stealing
from
the
honourable
b
company
if
a
man
bought
bacon
or
or
any
other
delicacy
and
stored
it
an
insecure
place
or
if
he
left
fish
on
the
beach
over
night
his
dogs
might
act
according
to
their
inclination
though
pichou
did
not
understand
how
honest
dogs
could
steal
from
their
own
master
he
was
willing
to
admit
that
this
was
their
affair
his
affair
was
that
nobody
should
steal
anything
from
the
post
it
cost
him
many
night
watches
and
some
large
battles
to
carry
it
out
but
he
did
it
in
the
course
of
time
it
came
to
pass
that
the
other
dogs
kept
away
from
the
post
altogether
to
avoid
temptations
and
his
own
team
spent
most
of
their
free
time
wandering
about
to
escape
discipline
the
third
law
was
this
strange
dogs
must
be
decently
treated
as
long
as
they
behave
decently
this
was
contrary
to
all
tradition
but
pichou
insisted
upon
it
if
a
strange
dog
wanted
to
fight
he
should
be
accommodated
with
an
antagonist
of
his
own
size
if
he
did
not
want
to
fight
he
should
be
politely
smelled
and
allowed
to
pass
through
this
law
originated
on
a
day
when
a
miserable
black
cur
a
cross
between
a
greyhound
and
a
strayed
into
seven
islands
from
heaven
knows
where
weary
desolate
and
bedraggled
all
the
dogs
in
the
place
attacked
the
homeless
beggar
there
was
a
howling
fracas
on
the
beach
and
when
pichou
arrived
the
trembling
cur
was
standing
up
to
the
neck
in
the
water
facing
a
semicircle
of
snarling
snapping
bullies
who
dared
not
venture
out
any
farther
pichou
had
no
fear
of
the
water
he
swam
out
to
the
stranger
paid
the
smelling
salute
as
well
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
encouraged
the
poor
creature
to
come
ashore
warned
off
the
other
dogs
and
trotted
by
the
wanderer
side
for
miles
down
the
beach
until
they
disappeared
around
the
point
what
reward
pichou
got
for
this
polite
escort
i
do
not
know
but
i
saw
him
do
the
gallant
deed
and
i
suppose
this
was
the
origin
of
the
and
law
of
strangers
rights
in
seven
islands
the
most
recalcitrant
subjects
with
whom
pichou
had
to
deal
in
all
these
matters
were
the
team
of
ovide
boulianne
there
were
five
of
them
and
up
to
this
time
they
had
been
the
best
team
in
the
village
they
had
one
virtue
under
the
whip
they
could
whirl
a
sledge
over
the
snow
farther
and
faster
than
a
horse
could
trot
in
a
day
but
they
had
innumerable
vices
their
leader
carcajou
had
a
fleece
like
a
merino
ram
but
under
this
coat
of
innocence
he
carried
a
heart
so
black
that
he
would
bite
while
he
was
wagging
his
tail
this
smooth
devil
and
his
four
followers
like
unto
himself
had
sworn
relentless
hatred
to
pichou
and
they
made
his
life
difficult
but
his
great
and
sufficient
consolation
for
all
toils
and
troubles
was
the
friendship
with
his
master
in
the
long
summer
evenings
when
dan
scott
was
making
up
his
accounts
in
the
store
or
studying
his
pocket
cyclopaedia
of
medicine
in
the
of
the
post
with
its
low
beams
and
mysterious
cupboards
pichou
would
lie
contentedly
at
his
feet
in
the
frosty
autumnal
mornings
when
the
brant
were
flocking
in
the
marshes
at
the
head
of
the
bay
they
would
go
out
hunting
together
in
a
skiff
and
who
could
lie
so
still
as
pichou
when
the
game
was
approaching
or
who
could
spring
so
quickly
and
joyously
to
retrieve
a
wounded
bird
but
best
of
all
were
the
long
walks
on
sunday
afternoons
on
the
yellow
beach
that
stretched
away
toward
the
moisie
or
through
the
behind
the
pointe
des
chasseurs
then
master
and
dog
had
fellowship
together
in
silence
to
the
dumb
companion
it
was
like
walking
with
his
god
in
the
garden
in
the
cool
of
the
day
when
winter
came
and
snow
fell
and
waters
froze
pichou
serious
duties
began
the
long
slim
cometique
with
its
curving
prow
and
its
runners
of
whalebone
was
put
in
order
the
harness
of
was
repaired
and
strengthened
the
dogs
even
the
most
vicious
of
them
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
doing
the
one
thing
that
they
could
do
best
each
one
strained
at
his
trace
as
if
he
would
drag
the
sledge
alone
then
the
long
tandem
was
straightened
out
dan
scott
took
his
place
on
the
low
seat
cracked
his
whip
shouted
pouitte
and
the
equipage
darted
along
the
snowy
track
like
a
arrow
pichou
was
in
the
lead
and
he
showed
his
metal
from
the
start
no
need
of
the
terrible
fouet
to
lash
him
forward
or
to
guide
his
course
a
word
was
enough
hoc
hoc
and
he
swung
to
the
right
avoiding
an
and
he
veered
to
the
left
dodging
a
heap
of
broken
ice
past
the
mouth
of
the
ste
marguerite
twelve
miles
past
les
jambons
twelve
miles
more
past
the
river
of
rocks
and
la
pentecote
fifteen
miles
more
into
the
little
hamlet
of
dead
point
behind
the
isle
of
the
wise
virgin
whither
the
amateur
doctor
had
been
summoned
by
telegraph
to
attend
a
patient
with
a
broken
arm
miles
for
the
first
day
run
not
bad
then
the
dogs
got
their
food
for
the
day
one
dried
fish
apiece
and
at
noon
the
next
day
reckless
of
bleeding
feet
they
flew
back
over
the
same
track
and
broke
their
fast
at
seven
islands
before
eight
the
ration
was
the
same
a
single
fish
always
the
same
except
when
it
was
varied
by
a
cube
of
ancient
potent
whale
flesh
which
a
dog
can
swallow
at
a
single
gulp
yet
the
dogs
of
the
north
shore
are
never
so
full
of
vigour
courage
and
joy
of
life
as
when
the
sledges
are
running
it
is
in
summer
when
food
is
plenty
and
work
slack
that
they
sicken
and
die
pichou
leadership
of
his
team
became
famous
under
his
discipline
the
other
dogs
developed
speed
and
steadiness
one
day
they
made
the
distance
to
the
godbout
in
a
single
journey
a
wonderful
run
of
over
eighty
miles
but
they
loved
their
leader
no
better
though
they
followed
him
faster
and
as
for
the
other
teams
especially
carcajou
they
were
still
firm
in
their
deadly
hatred
for
the
dog
with
the
black
patch
iii
it
was
in
the
second
winter
after
pichou
coming
to
seven
islands
that
the
great
trial
of
his
courage
arrived
late
in
february
an
indian
runner
on
snowshoes
staggered
into
the
village
he
brought
news
from
the
that
were
wintering
far
up
on
the
ste
marguerite
good
news
and
bad
first
they
had
already
made
a
good
hunting
for
the
pelletrie
that
is
to
say
they
had
killed
many
otter
some
fisher
and
beaver
and
four
silver
foxes
a
marvel
of
fortune
but
then
for
the
food
the
chase
was
bad
very
bad
no
caribou
no
hare
no
ptarmigan
nothing
for
many
days
provisions
were
very
low
there
were
six
families
together
then
la
grippe
had
taken
hold
of
them
they
were
sick
starving
they
would
probably
die
at
least
most
of
the
women
and
children
it
was
a
bad
job
dan
scott
had
peculiar
ideas
of
his
duty
toward
the
savages
he
was
not
romantic
but
he
liked
to
do
the
square
thing
besides
he
had
been
reading
up
on
la
grippe
and
he
had
some
new
medicine
for
it
capsules
from
montreal
very
powerful
quinine
phenacetine
and
morphine
he
was
as
eager
to
try
this
new
medicine
as
a
boy
is
to
fire
off
a
new
gun
he
loaded
the
cometique
with
provisions
and
the
with
capsules
harnessed
his
team
and
started
up
the
river
thermometer
thirty
degrees
below
zero
air
like
crystal
snow
six
feet
deep
on
the
level
the
first
day
journey
was
slow
for
the
going
was
soft
and
the
track
at
places
had
to
be
broken
out
with
camp
was
made
at
the
foot
of
the
big
fall
a
hole
in
snow
a
bed
of
boughs
a
hot
fire
and
a
blanket
stretched
on
a
couple
of
sticks
to
reflect
the
heat
the
dogs
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
and
pichou
close
to
his
master
in
the
morning
there
was
the
steep
hill
beside
the
fall
to
climb
alternately
soft
and
slippery
now
a
slope
of
glass
and
now
a
treacherous
drift
of
yielding
feathers
it
was
a
road
set
on
end
but
pichou
flattened
his
back
and
strained
his
loins
and
dug
his
toes
into
the
snow
and
would
not
give
back
an
inch
when
the
rest
of
the
team
balked
the
long
whip
slashed
across
their
backs
and
recalled
them
to
their
duty
at
last
their
leader
topped
the
ridge
and
the
others
struggled
after
him
before
them
stretched
the
great
of
the
river
a
straight
white
path
to
the
snow
was
smooth
and
level
and
the
crust
was
hard
enough
to
bear
pichou
settled
down
to
his
work
at
a
glorious
pace
he
seemed
to
know
that
he
must
do
his
best
and
that
something
important
depended
on
the
quickness
of
his
legs
on
through
the
glittering
solitude
on
through
the
silence
sped
the
cometique
between
the
interminable
walls
of
the
forest
past
the
mouths
of
nameless
rivers
under
the
shadow
of
grim
mountains
at
noon
dan
scott
boiled
the
kettle
and
ate
his
bread
and
bacon
but
there
was
nothing
for
the
dogs
not
even
for
pichou
for
discipline
is
discipline
and
the
best
of
will
not
run
well
after
he
has
been
fed
then
forward
again
along
the
lifeless
road
slowly
over
rapids
where
the
ice
was
rough
and
broken
swiftly
over
still
waters
where
the
way
was
level
until
they
came
to
the
foot
of
the
last
lake
and
camped
for
the
night
the
indians
were
but
a
few
miles
away
at
the
head
of
the
lake
and
it
would
be
easy
to
reach
them
in
the
morning
but
there
was
another
camp
on
the
ste
marguerite
that
night
and
it
was
nearer
to
dan
scott
than
the
indians
were
ovide
boulianne
had
followed
him
up
the
river
close
on
his
track
which
made
the
going
easier
that
sacre
bourgeois
suppose
that
i
allow
him
all
that
pelletrie
to
himself
and
the
compagnie
four
silver
fox
besides
otter
and
beaver
non
merci
i
take
some
provision
and
some
whiskey
i
go
to
make
trade
thus
spoke
the
shrewd
ovide
proving
that
commerce
is
no
less
daring
no
less
resolute
than
philanthropy
the
only
difference
is
in
the
motive
and
that
is
not
always
visible
ovide
camped
the
second
night
at
a
bend
of
the
river
a
mile
below
the
foot
of
the
lake
between
him
and
dan
scott
there
was
a
hill
covered
with
a
dense
thicket
of
spruce
by
what
magic
did
carcajou
know
that
pichou
his
old
enemy
was
so
near
him
in
that
vast
wilderness
of
white
death
by
what
mysterious
language
did
he
communicate
his
knowledge
to
his
companions
and
stir
the
sleeping
hatred
in
their
hearts
and
mature
the
conspiracy
of
revenge
pichou
sleeping
by
the
fire
was
awakened
by
the
fall
of
a
lump
of
snow
from
the
branch
of
a
shaken
evergreen
that
was
nothing
but
there
were
other
sounds
in
the
forest
faint
stealthy
inaudible
to
an
ear
less
keen
than
his
he
crept
out
of
the
shelter
and
looked
into
the
wood
he
could
see
shadowy
forms
stealing
among
the
trees
gliding
down
the
hill
five
of
them
wolves
doubtless
he
must
guard
the
provisions
by
this
time
the
rest
of
his
team
were
awake
their
eyes
glittered
they
stirred
uneasily
but
they
did
not
move
from
the
dying
fire
it
was
no
concern
of
theirs
what
their
leader
chose
to
do
out
of
hours
in
the
traces
they
would
follow
him
but
there
was
no
loyalty
in
their
hearts
pichou
stood
alone
by
the
sledge
waiting
for
the
wolves
but
these
were
no
wolves
they
were
assassins
like
a
company
of
soldiers
they
lined
up
together
and
rushed
silently
down
the
slope
like
lightning
they
leaped
upon
the
solitary
dog
and
struck
him
down
in
an
instant
before
dan
scott
could
throw
off
his
blanket
and
seize
the
loaded
butt
of
his
whip
pichou
throat
and
breast
were
torn
to
rags
his
poured
upon
the
snow
and
his
murderers
were
slinking
away
slavering
and
muttering
through
the
forest
dan
scott
knelt
beside
his
best
friend
at
a
glance
he
saw
that
the
injury
was
fatal
done
pichou
he
murmured
fought
a
good
and
the
dog
by
a
brave
effort
lifted
the
head
with
the
black
patch
on
it
for
the
last
time
licked
his
master
hand
and
then
dropped
back
upon
the
snow
contented
happy
dead
there
is
but
one
drawback
to
a
dog
friendship
it
does
not
last
long
enough
end
of
the
story
well
if
you
care
for
the
other
people
in
it
you
shall
hear
what
became
of
them
dan
scott
went
on
to
the
head
of
the
lake
and
found
the
indians
and
fed
them
and
gave
them
his
medicine
and
all
of
them
got
well
except
two
and
they
continued
to
hunt
along
the
ste
marguerite
every
winter
and
trade
with
the
honourable
b
company
not
with
dan
scott
however
for
before
that
year
was
ended
he
resigned
his
post
and
went
to
montreal
to
finish
his
course
in
medicine
and
now
he
is
a
respected
physician
in
ontario
married
three
children
useful
prosperous
but
before
he
left
seven
islands
he
went
up
the
ste
marguerite
in
the
summer
by
canoe
and
made
a
grave
for
pichou
bones
under
a
blossoming
ash
tree
among
the
ferns
and
wild
flowers
he
put
a
cross
over

i
swear
he
was

the

i
the
real
location
of
a
city
house
depends
upon
the
pictures
which
hang
upon
its
walls
they
are
its
neighbourhood
and
its
outlook
they
confer
upon
it
that
touch
of
life
and
character
that
power
to
beget
love
and
bind
friendship
which
a

house
receives
from
its
surrounding
landscape
the

that
embraces
it

stream
that
runs
near
it
and
the
shaded
paths
that
lead
to
and
from
its
door
by
this
magic
of
pictures
my
narrow
upright
slice
of
in
one
of
the
strata
on
the
eastward
slope
of
manhattan
island
is
transferred
to
an
open
and
agreeable
site
it
has
windows
that
look
toward
the
woods
and
the
sunset
watergates
by
which
a
little
boat
is
always
waiting
and
secret
passageways
leading
into
fair
places
that
are
frequented
by
persons

distinction
and
charm
no

obscures

outlets
no

no

snow
of

makes
them
impassable
they
are
always
free
and
through
them
i
go
out
and
in
upon
my
adventures
one
of
these
has
always
appeared
to
me
so
singular
that
i
would
like
if
it
were
possible
to
put
it
into
words
it
was
pierrepont
who
first
introduced
me
to
the
picture
pierrepont
the
of
whom
one
of
his
friends
said
that
he
was
like
bridge
of
paradise
because
he
was
so
hard
to
cross
to
which
another
added
that
there
was
also
a
resemblance
in
the
fact
that
he
led
to
a
region
of
beautiful
illusions
which
he
never
entered
he
is
one
of
those
enthusiastic
souls
who
are
always
discovering
a
new
writer
a
new
painter
a
new
view
from
some
old
wharf
by
the
river
a
new
place
to
obtain
picturesque
dinners
at
a
grotesque
price
he
swung
out
of
his
office
with
his
easy
stride
and
nearly
ran
me
down
as
i
was
plodding
through
the
languor
of
a
late
spring
afternoon
on
one
of
those
which
conscience
offers
as
a
sacrifice
to
digestion
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
cried
as
he
linked
his
arm
through
mine
look
outdone
tired
all
the
way
through
to
your
backbone
have
you
been

even
in

of

altogether

i
do
need
a
dinner
at
your

seven

the

suggests
that

not

let
us
go
home
together
and
have
a
and
a
dinner
of
herbs
with
just
a
reminiscence
of
the
stalled
ox
and
a
bout
at
backgammon
to
wind
up
the
evening
that
will
be
the
most
comfortable
you
mistake
me
said
he
am
not
thinking
of
any
creature
comforts
for
you
i
am
prescribing
for
your
mind
there
is
a
picture
that
i
want
you
to
see
not
a
coloured
photograph
nor
an
exercise
in
anatomical
drawing
but
a
real
picture
that
will
rest
the
eyes
of
your
heart
come
away
with
me
to
morgenstern
gallery
and
be
as
we
turned
into
the
lower
end
of
fifth
avenue
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
being
gently
floated
along
between
the
modest
and
dwellings
and
prim
respectable
churches
on
the
smooth
current
of
pierrepont
talk
about
his
picture
how
often
a
man
has
cause
to
return
thanks
for
the
enthusiasms
of
his
friends
they
are
the
little
fountains
that
run
down
from
the
hills
to
refresh
the
mental
desert
of
the
despondent
remember
falconer
continued
pierrepont
falconer
that
modest
quiet
proud
fellow
who
came
out
of
the
south
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
carried
off
the
landscape
prize
at
the
academy
last
year
and
then
disappeared
he
had
no
intimate
friends
here
and
no
one
knew
what
had
become
of
him
but
now
this
picture
appears
to
show
what
he
has
been
doing
it
is
an
evening
scene
a
revelation
of
the
beauty
of
sadness
an
idea
expressed
in
colours
or
rather
a
real
impression
of
nature
that
awakens
an
ideal
feeling
in
the
heart
it
does
not
define
everything
and
say
nothing
like
so
many
paintings
it
tells
no
story
but
i
know
it
fits
into
one
there
is
not
a
figure
in
it
and
yet
it
is
alive
with
sentiment
it
suggests
thoughts
which
can
not
be
put
into
words
do
you
love
the
pictures
that
have
that
power
of
suggestion
quiet
and
strong
like
homer
martin
up
at
the
century
with
its
sheltered
bay
heaving
softly
under
the
pallid
greenish
sky
of
evening
and
the
calm
steadfast
glow
of
the
lantern
brightening
into
readiness
for
all
the
perils
of
night
and
coming
storm
how
much
more
powerful
that
is
than
all
the
conventional
pictures
of
on
inaccessible
cliffs
with
white
foam
streaming
from
them
like
the
ends
of
a
schoolboy
comforter
in
a
gale
of
wind
i
tell
you
the
real
painters
are
the
fellows
who
love
pure
nature
because
it
is
so
human
they
do
need
to
exaggerate
and
they
do
dare
to
be
affected
they
are
not
afraid
of
the
reality
and
they
are
not
ashamed
of
the
sentiment
they
do
paint
everything
that
they
see
but
they
see
everything
that
they
paint
and
this
picture
makes
me
sure
that
falconer
is
one
of
by
this
time
we
had
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
house
where
morgenstern
lives
and
moves
and
makes
his
profits
and
were
admitted
to
the
shrine
of
the
commercial
apollo
and
the
muses
in
trade
it
has
often
seemed
to
me
as
if
that
little
house
were
a
silent
epitome
of
modern
art
criticism
an
automatic
indicator
or
perhaps
regulator
of
the
aesthetic
taste
of
new
york
on
the
first
floor
surrounded
by
all
the
newest
fashions
in
antiquities
and
you
will
see
the
art
of
the
works
of
painters
who
are
precisely
in
the
focus
of
advertisement
and
whose
names
call
out
an
instant
round
of
applause
in
the
on
the
floors
above
in
degrees
of
obscurity
deepening
toward
the
attic
you
will
find
the
art
of
yesterday
the
pictures
which
have
passed
out
of
the
glare
of
popularity
without
yet
arriving
at
the
mellow
radiance
of
old
masters
in
the
basement
concealed
in
huge
and
marked
fragile
you
will
find
the
art
of
the
paintings
of
the
men
in
regard
to
whose
names
styles
and
personal
traits
the
foreign
correspondents
and
prophetic
critics
in
the
newspapers
are
now
diffusing
in
the
public
mind
that
twilight
of
familiarity
and
ignorance
which
precedes
the
sunrise
of
marketable
fame
the
affable
and
sagacious
morgenstern
was
already
well
acquainted
with
the
waywardness
of
pierrepont
admiration
and
with
my
own
persistent
disregard
of
current
quotations
in
the
valuation
of
works
of
art
he
regarded
us
i
suppose
very
much
as
robin
hood
would
have
looked
upon
a
pair
of
plain
yeomen
who
had
strayed
into
his
lair
the
knights
of
capital
and
coal
barons
and
rich
merchants
were
his
natural
prey
but
toward
this
poor
but
honest
couple
it
would
be
worthy
only
of
a
gentile
robber
to
show
anything
but
courteous
and
fair
dealing
he
expressed
no
surprise
when
he
heard
what
we
wanted
to
see
but
smiled
tolerantly
and
led
the
way
not
into
the
realm
of
the
past
the
present
or
the
future
but
into
a
region
of
uncertain
fortunes
a
limbo
of
acknowledged
but
unrewarded
merits
a
large
back
room
devoted
to
the
works
of
american
painters
here
we
found
falconer
picture
and
the
dealer
with
that
instinctive
tact
which
is
the
best
part
of
his
business
capital
left
us
alone
to
look
at
it
it
showed
the
mouth
of
a
little
river
a
secluded
lagoon
where
the
shallow
tides
rose
and
fell
with
vague
lassitude
following
the
impulse
of
prevailing
winds
more
than
the
strong
attraction
of
the
moon
but
now
the
unsailed
harbour
was
quite
still
in
the
pause
of
the
evening
and
the
smooth
undulations
were
caressed
by
a
hundred
opalescent
hues
growing
deeper
toward
the
west
where
the
river
came
in
converging
lines
of
trees
stood
dark
against
the
sky
a
cleft
in
the
woods
marked
the
course
of
the
stream
above
which
the
reluctant
splendours
of
an
autumnal
day
were
dying
in
ashes
of
roses
while
three
tiny
clouds
poised
high
in
air
burned
red
with
the
last
glimpse
of
the
departed
sun
on
the
right
was
a
reedy
point
running
out
into
the
bay
and
behind
it
on
a
slight
rise
of
ground
an
antique
house
with
tall
white
pillars
it
was
but
dimly
outlined
in
the
gathering
shadows
yet
one
could
imagine
its
stately
formal
aspect
its
precise
garden
with
beds
of
flowers
and
straight
paths
bordered
with
box
and
a
little
arbour
overgrown
with
honeysuckle
i
know
not
by
what
subtlety
of
delicate
and
indescribable
touches
a
slight
inclination
in
one
of
the
pillars
a
broken
line
which
might
indicate
an
unhinged
gate
a
drooping
resignation
in
the
foliage
of
the
yellowing
trees
a
tone
of
sadness
in
the
blending
of
subdued
colours
the
painter
had
suggested
that
the
place
was
deserted
but
the
truth
was
unmistakable
an
air
of
loneliness
and
pensive
sorrow
breathed
from
the
picture
a
sigh
of
longing
and
regret
it
was
haunted
by
sad
sweet
memories
of
some
untold
story
of
human
life
in
the
corner
falconer
had
put
his
signature
and
on
the
border
of
the
picture
he
had
faintly
traced
some
words
which
we
made
out
at
last
spirit
haunts
the
year
last
pierrepont
took
up
the
quotation
and
completed
it
spirit
haunts
the
year
last
hours
dwelling
amid
these
yellowing
bowers
to
himself
he
talks
for
at
eventide
listening
earnestly
at
his
work
you
may
hear
him
sob
and
sigh
in
the
walks
earthward
he
boweth
the
heavy
stalks
of
the
mouldering
flowers
heavily
hangs
the
broad
sunflower
over
its
grave
i
the
earth
so
chilly
heavily
hangs
the
hollyhock
heavily
hangs
the
is
very
pretty
poetry
gentlemen
said
morgenstern
who
had
come
in
behind
us
is
it
not
a
little
vague
you
like
it
but
you
can
not
tell
exactly
what
it
means
i
find
the
same
fault
in
the
picture
from
my
point
of
view
there
is
nothing
in
it
to
make
a
paragraph
about
no
anecdote
no
experiment
in
technique
it
is
impossible
to
persuade
the
public
to
admire
a
picture
unless
you
can
tell
them
precisely
the
points
on
which
they
must
fix
their
admiration
and
that
is
why
although
the
painting
is
a
good
one
i
should
be
willing
to
sell
it
at
a
low
he
named
a
sum
of
money
in
three
figures
so
small
that
pierrepont
who
often
buys
pictures
by
proxy
could
not
conceal
his
surprise
i
should
consider
that
a
good
bargain
simply
for
investment
said
he
name
alone
ought
to
be
worth
more
than
that
ten
years
from
now
he
is
a
rising
pierrepont
replied
the
dealer
picture
is
worth
what
i
ask
for
it
for
i
would
not
commit
the
impertinence
of
offering
a
present
to
you
or
your
friend
but
it
is
worth
no
more
falconer
name
will
not
increase
in
value
the
catalogue
of
his
works
is
too
short
for
fame
to
take
much
notice
of
it
and
this
is
the
last
did
you
not
hear
of
his
death
last
fall
i
do
not
wonder
for
it
happened
at
some
place
down
on
long
island
a
name
that
i
never
saw
before
and
have
forgotten
now
there
was
not
even
an
obituary
in
the
besides
he
continued
after
a
pause
must
not
conceal
from
you
that
the
painting
has
a
blemish
it
is
not
always
visible
since
you
have
failed
to
detect
it
but
it
is
more
noticeable
in
some
lights
than
in
others
and
do
what
i
will
i
can
not
remove
it
this
alone
would
prevent
the
painting
from
being
a
good
investment
its
market
value
will
never
he
turned
the
canvas
sideways
to
the
light
and
the
defect
became
apparent
it
was
a
dim
oblong
white
blot
in
the
middle
distance
a
nebulous
blur
in
the
painting
as
if
there
had
been
some
chemical
impurity
in
the
pigment
causing
it
to
fade
or
rather
as
if
a
long
drop
of
some
acid
or
perhaps
a
splash
of
salt
water
had
fallen
upon
the
canvas
while
it
was
wet
and
bleached
it
i
knew
little
of
the
possible
causes
of
such
a
blot
but
enough
to
see
that
it
could
not
be
erased
without
painting
over
it
perhaps
not
even
then
and
yet
it
seemed
rather
to
enhance
than
to
weaken
the
attraction
which
the
picture
had
for
me
candour
does
you
credit
morgenstern
said
i
you
know
me
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
what
you
have
said
will
hardly
discourage
me
for
i
have
never
been
an
admirer
of
finish
in
works
of
art
nor
have
i
been
in
the
habit
of
buying
them
as
a
circassian
father
trains
his
daughters
with
an
eye
to
the
market
they
come
into
my
house
for
my
own
pleasure
and
when
the
time
arrives
that
i
can
see
them
no
longer
it
will
not
matter
much
to
me
what
price
they
bring
in
the
this
landscape
pleases
me
so
thoroughly
that
if
you
will
let
us
take
it
with
us
this
evening
i
will
send
you
a
check
for
the
amount
in
the
so
we
carried
off
the
painting
in
a
cab
and
all
the
way
home
i
was
in
the
pleasant
excitement
of
a
man
who
is
about
to
make
an
addition
to
his
house
while
pierrepont
was
conscious
of
the
glow
of
virtue
which
comes
of
having
done
a
favour
to
a
friend
and
justified
your
own
critical
judgment
at
one
stroke
after
dinner
we
hung
the
painting
over
the
in
the
room
called
the
study
because
it
was
consecrated
to
idleness
and
sat
there
far
into
the
night
talking
of
the
few
times
we
had
met
falconer
at
the
club
and
of
his
reticent
manner
which
was
broken
by
curious
flashes
of
impersonal
confidence
when
he
spoke
not
of
himself
but
of
his
art
from
this
we
drifted
into
memories
of
good
comrades
who
had
walked
beside
us
but
a
few
days
in
the
path
of
life
and
then
disappeared
yet
left
us
feeling
as
if
we
cared
more
for
them
than
for
the
men
whom
we
see
every
day
and
of
young
geniuses
who
had
never
reached
the
goal
and
of
many
other
glimpses
of
light
that
failed
until
the
lamp
was
low
and
it
was
time
to
say
ii
for
several
months
i
continued
to
advance
in
intimacy
with
my
picture
it
grew
more
familiar
more
suggestive
the
truth
and
beauty
of
it
came
home
to
me
constantly
yet
there
was
something
in
it
not
quite
apprehended
a
sense
of
strangeness
a
reserve
which
i
had
not
yet
penetrated
one
night
in
august
i
found
myself
practically
alone
so
far
as
human
intercourse
was
concerned
in
the
populous
weary
city
a
couple
of
hours
of
writing
had
produced
nothing
that
would
bear
the
test
of
sunlight
so
i
anticipated
judgment
by
tearing
up
the
spoiled
sheets
of
paper
and
threw
myself
upon
the
couch
before
the
empty
fireplace
it
was
a
dense
sultry
night
with
electricity
thickening
the
air
and
a
trouble
of
distant
thunder
rolling
far
away
on
the
rim
of
the
cloudy
sky
one
of
those
nights
of
restless
dulness
when
you
wait
and
long
for
something
to
happen
and
yet
feel
despondently
that
nothing
ever
will
happen
again
i
passed
through
a
region
of
aimless
thoughts
into
one
of
migratory
and
unfinished
dreams
and
dropped
from
that
into
an
empty
gulf
of
sleep
how
late
it
was
when
i
drifted
back
toward
the
shore
of
consciousness
i
can
not
tell
but
the
on
the
table
had
burned
out
and
the
light
of
the
gibbous
moon
was
creeping
in
through
the
open
windows
slowly
the
pale
illumination
crept
up
the
eastern
wall
like
a
tide
rising
as
the
moon
declined
now
it
reached
the
and
overflowed
the
bronze
heads
of
homer
and
the
indian
bacchus
and
the
egyptian
image
of
isis
with
the
infant
horus
now
it
touched
the
frame
of
the
picture
and
lapped
over
the
edge
now
it
rose
to
the
shadowy
house
and
the
dim
garden
in
the
midst
of
which
i
saw
the
white
blot
more
distinctly
than
ever
before
it
seemed
now
to
have
taken
a
new
shape
like
the
slender
form
of
a
woman
robed
in
flowing
white
and
as
i
watched
it
through
eyes
the
figure
appeared
to
move
and
tremble
and
wave
to
and
fro
as
if
it
were
a
ghost
a
haunted
picture
why
should
it
not
be
so
a
haunted
ruin
a
haunted
forest
a
haunted
ship
all
these
have
been
seen
or
imagined
and
reported
and
there
are
learned
societies
for
investigating
such
things
why
should
not
a
picture
have
a
ghost
in
it
my
mind
in
that
curiously
vivid
state
which
lies
between
waking
and
sleeping
went
through
the
form
of
careful
reasoning
over
the
question
if
there
may
be
some
subtle
connection
between
a
house
and
the
spirits
of
the
people
who
have
once
lived
in
it
and
wise
men
have
believed
this
why
should
there
be
any
impassable
gulf
between
a
picture
and
the
vanished
lives
out
of
which
it
has
grown
all
the
human
thought
and
feeling
which
have
passed
into
it
through
the
patient
toil
of
art
remain
forever
embodied
there
a
picture
is
the
most
living
and
personal
thing
that
a
man
can
leave
behind
him
when
we
look
at
it
we
see
what
he
saw
hour
after
hour
day
after
day
and
we
see
it
through
his
mood
and
impression
coloured
by
his
emotion
tinged
with
his
personality
surely
if
the
spirits
of
the
dead
are
not
extinguished
but
only
veiled
and
hidden
and
if
it
were
possible
by
any
means
that
their
presence
could
flash
for
a
moment
through
the
veil
it
would
be
most
natural
that
they
should
come
back
again
to
hover
around
the
work
into
which
their
experience
and
passion
had
been
woven
here
if
anywhere
they
would
the
pale
glimpses
of
the
here
if
anywhere
we
might
catch
fleeting
sight
as
in
a
glass
darkly
of
the
visions
that
passed
before
them
while
they
worked
this
much
of
my
train
of
reasoning
along
the
edge
of
the
dark
i
remember
sharply
but
after
this
all
was
confused
and
misty
the
shore
of
consciousness
receded
i
floated
out
again
on
the
ocean
of
forgotten
dreams
when
i
woke
it
was
with
a
quick
start
as
if
my
ship
had
been
made
fast
silently
and
suddenly
at
the
wharf
of
reality
and
the
bell
rang
for
me
to
step
ashore
but
the
vision
of
the
white
blot
remained
clear
and
distinct
and
the
question
that
it
had
brought
to
me
the
chain
of
thoughts
that
had
linked
themselves
to
it
lingered
through
the
morning
and
made
me
feel
sure
that
there
was
an
untold
secret
in
falconer
life
and
that
the
clew
to
it
must
be
sought
in
the
history
of
his
last
picture
but
how
to
trace
the
connection
every
one
who
had
known
falconer
however
slightly
was
out
of
town
there
was
no
clew
to
follow
even
the
name
gave
me
no
help
for
i
could
not
find
it
on
any
map
of
long
island
it
was
probably
the
fanciful
title
of
some
old
familiar
only
to
the
people
who
had
lived
there
but
the
very
remoteness
of
the
problem
its
lack
of
contact
with
the
practical
world
fascinated
me
it
was
like
something
that
had
drifted
away
in
the
fog
on
a
sea
of
unknown
and
fluctuating
currents
the
only
possible
way
to
find
it
was
to
commit
yourself
to
the
same
wandering
tides
and
drift
after
it
trusting
to
a
propitious
fortune
that
you
might
be
carried
in
the
same
direction
and
after
a
long
blind
unhurrying
chase
one
day
you
might
feel
a
faint
touch
a
jar
a
thrill
along
the
side
of
your
boat
and
peering
through
the
fog
lay
your
hand
at
last
without
surprise
upon
the
very
object
of
your
quest
iii
as
it
happened
the
means
for
such
a
quest
were
at
my
disposal
i
was
part
owner
of
a
boat
which
had
been
built
for
hunting
and
fishing
cruises
on
the
shallow
waters
of
the
great
south
bay
it
was
a
deliberate
but
not
inconvenient
craft
well
named
the
patience
and
my
turn
for
using
it
had
come
black
zekiel
the
captain
crew
and
cook
was
the
very
man
that
i
would
have
chosen
for
such
an
expedition
he
combined
the
indolent
of
the
negro
with
the
taciturnity
of
the
indian
and
knew
every
shoal
and
channel
of
the
tortuous
waters
he
asked
nothing
better
than
to
set
out
on
a
voyage
without
a
port
sailing
aimlessly
eastward
day
after
day
through
the
long
chain
of
landlocked
bays
with
the
sea
plunging
behind
the
on
our
right
and
the
shores
of
long
island
sleeping
on
our
left
anchoring
every
evening
in
some
little
cove
or
estuary
where
zekiel
could
sit
on
the
cabin
roof
smoking
his
pipe
and
meditating
on
the
vanity
and
comfort
of
life
while
i
pushed
off
through
the
mellow
dusk
to
explore
every
creek
and
bend
of
the
shore
in
my
light
canoe
there
was
nothing
to
hasten
our
voyage
the
three
weeks
vacation
was
all
but
gone
when
the
patience
groped
her
way
through
a
narrow
crooked
channel
in
a
wide
and
entered
the
last
of
the
series
of
bays
a
few
houses
straggled
down
a
point
of
land
the
village
of
quantock
lay
a
little
farther
back
beyond
that
was
a
belt
of
woods
reaching
to
the
water
and
from
these
the
road
emerged
to
cross
the
upper
end
of
the
bay
on
a
low
causeway
with
a
narrow
bridge
of
planks
at
the
central
point
here
was
our
ultima
thule
not
even
the
patience
could
thread
the
eye
of
this
needle
or
float
through
the
shallow
farther
to
the
east
we
anchored
just
in
front
of
the
bridge
and
as
i
pushed
the
canoe
beneath
it
after
supper
i
felt
the
indefinable
sensation
of
having
passed
that
way
before
i
knew
beforehand
what
the
little
boat
would
drift
into
the
broad
saffron
light
of
evening
fading
over
a
still
lagoon
two
converging
lines
of
pine
trees
running
back
into
the
sunset
a
grassy
point
upon
the
right
and
behind
that
a
neglected
garden
a
tangled
bower
of
honeysuckle
a
straight
path
bordered
with
box
leading
to
a
deserted
house
with
a
high
porch
yes
it
was
larmone
in
the
morning
i
went
up
to
the
village
to
see
if
i
could
find
trace
of
my
artist
visit
to
the
place
there
was
no
difficulty
in
the
search
for
he
had
been
there
often
the
people
had
plenty
of
recollections
of
him
but
no
real
memory
for
it
seemed
as
if
none
of
them
had
really
known
him
kinder
fellow
said
a
wrinkled
old
bayman
with
whom
i
walked
up
the
sandy
road
seen
him
a
good
deal
round
here
but
like
havin
any
with
him
he
allus
kep
himself
to
himself
pooty
much
used
ter
stay
round
ladoo
place
most
o
the
time
keepin
with
the
gal
i
guess
larmone
yaas
that
what
they
called
it
but
we
do
go
much
on
fancy
names
down
here
no
the
painter
didn
live
there
but
it
to
the
same
thing
las
summer
they
was
all
away
house
shet
up
painter
hangin
round
all
the
time
if
he
looked
fur
to
come
back
any
minnit
purfessed
to
be
paintin
but
i
don
see
he
did
much
lived
up
to
mort
halsey
died
there
too
year
ago
this
fall
guess
mis
halsey
can
tell
ye
most
of
any
one
at
the
with
wide
low
verandas
now
forsaken
by
the
summer
boarders
which
did
duty
for
a
village
inn
i
found
halsey
a
notable
housewife
with
a
strong
taste
for
ancestry
and
an
uncultivated
world
of
romance
still
brightening
her
soft
brown
eyes
she
knew
all
the
threads
in
the
story
that
i
was
following
and
the
interest
with
which
she
spoke
made
it
evident
that
she
had
often
woven
them
together
in
the
winter
evenings
on
patterns
of
her
own
judge
ledoux
had
come
to
quantock
from
the
south
during
the
war
and
built
a
house
there
like
the
one
he
used
to
live
in
there
were
three
things
he
hated
slavery
and
war
and
society
but
he
always
loved
the
south
more
than
the
north
and
lived
like
a
foreigner
polite
enough
but
very
retired
his
wife
died
after
a
few
years
and
left
him
alone
with
a
little
girl
claire
grew
up
as
pretty
as
a
picture
but
very
shy
and
delicate
about
two
years
ago
falconer
had
come
down
from
the
city
he
stayed
at
larmone
first
and
then
he
came
to
the
but
he
was
over
at
the
ledoux
house
almost
all
the
time
he
was
a
southerner
too
and
a
relative
of
the
family
a
real
gentleman
and
very
proud
though
he
was
poor
it
seemed
strange
that
he
should
not
live
with
them
but
perhaps
he
felt
more
free
over
here
every
one
thought
he
must
be
engaged
to
claire
but
he
was
not
the
kind
of
a
man
that
you
could
ask
questions
about
himself
a
year
ago
last
winter
he
had
gone
up
to
the
city
and
taken
all
his
things
with
him
he
had
never
stayed
away
so
long
before
in
the
spring
the
ledoux
had
gone
to
europe
claire
seemed
to
be
falling
into
a
decline
her
sight
seemed
to
be
failing
and
her
father
said
she
must
see
a
famous
doctor
and
have
a
change
of
air
falconer
came
back
in
may
continued
the
good
lady
if
he
expected
to
find
them
but
the
house
was
shut
up
and
nobody
knew
just
where
they
were
he
seemed
to
be
all
taken
aback
it
was
queer
if
he
did
know
about
it
intimate
as
he
had
been
but
he
never
said
anything
and
made
no
inquiries
just
seemed
to
be
waiting
as
if
there
was
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
we
would
have
told
him
in
a
minute
if
we
had
anything
to
tell
but
all
we
could
do
was
to
guess
there
must
have
been
some
kind
of
a
quarrel
between
him
and
the
judge
and
if
there
was
he
must
know
best
about
it
himself
summer
long
he
kept
going
over
to
the
house
and
wandering
around
in
the
garden
in
the
fall
he
began
to
paint
a
picture
but
it
was
very
slow
painting
he
would
go
over
in
the
afternoon
and
come
back
long
after
dark
damp
with
the
dew
and
fog
he
kept
growing
paler
and
weaker
and
more
silent
some
days
he
did
not
speak
more
than
a
dozen
words
but
always
kind
and
pleasant
he
was
just
dwindling
away
and
when
the
picture
was
almost
done
a
fever
took
hold
of
him
the
doctor
said
it
was
malaria
but
it
seemed
to
me
more
like
a
trouble
in
the
throat
a
kind
of
dumb
misery
and
one
night
in
the
third
quarter
of
the
moon
just
after
the
tide
turned
to
run
out
he
raised
up
in
the
bed
and
tried
to
speak
but
he
was
gone
tried
to
find
out
his
relations
but
there
did
seem
to
be
any
except
the
ledoux
and
they
were
out
of
reach
so
we
sent
the
picture
up
to
our
cousin
in
brooklyn
and
it
sold
for
about
enough
to
pay
falconer
summer
board
and
the
cost
of
his
funeral
there
was
nothing
else
that
he
left
of
any
value
except
a
few
books
perhaps
you
would
like
to
look
at
them
if
you
were
his
friend
never
saw
any
one
that
i
seemed
to
know
so
little
and
like
so
well
it
was
a
disappointment
in
love
of
course
and
they
all
said
that
he
died
of
a
broken
heart
but
i
think
it
was
because
his
heart
was
too
full
and
would
break
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
a
week
after
he
was
gone
there
was
a
notice
in
the
paper
that
claire
ledoux
had
died
suddenly
on
the
last
of
august
at
some
place
in
switzerland
her
father
is
still
away
travelling
and
so
the
whole
story
is
broken
off
and
will
never
be
finished
will
you
look
at
the
books
nothing
is
more
pathetic
to
my
mind
than
to
take
up
the
books
of
one
who
is
dead
here
is
his
name
with
perhaps
a
note
of
the
place
where
the
volume
was
bought
or
read
and
the
marks
on
the
pages
that
he
liked
best
here
are
the
passages
that
gave
him
pleasure
and
the
thoughts
that
entered
into
his
life
and
formed
it
they
became
part
of
him
but
where
has
he
carried
them
now
falconer
little
library
was
an
unstudied
choice
and
gave
a
hint
of
his
character
there
was
a
new
testament
in
french
with
his
name
written
in
a
slender
woman
hand
three
or
four
volumes
of
stories
cable
creole
days
allen
cardinal
page
old
virginia
and
the
like
and
amiel
and
lamartine
and
a
few
volumes
of
poetry
among
them
one
of
sidney
lanier
and
one
of
tennyson
earlier
poems
there
was
also
a
little
book
of
manuscript
notes
this
i
begged
permission
to
carry
away
with
me
hoping
to
find
in
it
something
which
would
throw
light
upon
my
picture
perhaps
even
some
message
to
be
carried
some
hint
or
suggestion
of
something
which
the
writer
would
fain
have
had
done
for
him
and
which
i
promised
myself
faithfully
to
perform
as
a
test
of
an
imagined
friendship
imagined
not
in
the
future
but
in
the
impossible
past
i
read
the
book
in
this
spirit
searching
its
pages
carefully
through
the
long
afternoon
in
the
solitary
cabin
of
my
boat
there
was
nothing
at
first
but
an
ordinary
diary
a
record
of
the
work
and
of
a
poor
student
of
art
then
came
the
date
of
his
first
visit
to
larmone
and
an
expression
of
the
pleasure
of
being
with
his
own
people
again
after
a
lonely
life
and
some
chronicle
of
his
occupations
there
studies
for
pictures
and
idle
days
that
were
summed
up
in
a
phrase
the
bay
or
the
after
this
the
regular
succession
of
dates
was
broken
and
there
followed
a
few
scraps
of
verse
irregular
and
unfinished
bound
together
by
the
thread
of
a
name
among
her
roses
ride
through
the
pines
with
claire
old
song
of
blue
flower
in
claire
it
was
not
poetry
but
such
an
unconscious
tribute
to
the
power
and
beauty
of
poetry
as
unfolds
itself
almost
inevitably
from
youthful
love
as
naturally
as
the
blossoms
unfold
from
the
apple
trees
in
may
if
you
pick
them
they
are
worthless
they
charm
only
in
their
own
time
and
place
a
date
told
of
his
change
from
larmone
to
the
village
and
this
was
written
below
it
heavy
a
sense
of
obligation
destroys
freedom
and
only
a
free
man
can
dare
to
then
came
a
number
of
fragments
indicating
trouble
of
mind
and
hesitation
the
sensitiveness
of
the
artist
the
delicate
scruples
of
the
lonely
idealist
the
morbid
pride
of
the
young
poor
man
contending
with
an
impetuous
passion
and
forcing
it
to
surrender
or
at
least
to
compromise
right
has
a
man
to
demand
everything
and
offer
nothing
in
return
except
an
ambition
and
a
hope
love
must
come
as
a
giver
not
as
a
knight
should
not
ask
to
wear
his
lady
colours
until
he
has
won
his
cophetua
and
the
very
fine
but
the
other
way
humiliating
woman
may
take
everything
from
a
man
wealth
and
fame
and
position
but
there
is
only
one
thing
that
a
man
may
accept
from
a
woman
something
that
she
alone
can
give
is
less
than
love
but
it
is
the
trellis
that
holds
love
up
from
the
ground
break
it
down
and
all
the
flowers
are
in
the
dust
the
fruit
is
so
the
man
thought
shone
through
everywhere
think
she
must
know
that
i
love
her
and
why
i
can
not
one
entry
was
written
in
a
clearer
stronger
hand
end
of
hesitation
the
longest
way
is
the
shortest
i
am
going
to
the
city
to
work
for
the
academy
prize
to
think
of
nothing
else
until
i
win
it
and
then
come
back
with
it
to
claire
to
tell
her
that
i
have
a
future
and
that
it
is
hers
if
i
spoke
of
it
now
it
would
be
like
claiming
the
reward
before
i
had
done
the
work
i
have
told
her
only
that
i
am
going
to
prove
myself
an
artist
and
to
live
for
what
i
love
best
she
understood
i
am
sure
for
she
would
not
lift
her
eyes
to
me
but
her
hand
trembled
as
she
gave
me
the
blue
flower
from
her
the
date
of
his
return
to
larmone
was
marked
but
the
page
was
blank
as
the
day
had
been
some
pages
of
dull
and
questioning
and
bewildered
regret
followed
it
possible
that
she
has
gone
away
without
a
word
without
a
sign
after
what
has
passed
between
us
it
is
not
fair
surely
i
had
some
what
claim
after
all
i
asked
for
nothing
and
was
it
not
pride
that
kept
me
silent
taking
it
for
granted
that
if
i
asked
she
would
give
was
a
mistake
she
did
not
understand
nor
was
my
fault
i
might
at
least
have
told
her
that
i
loved
her
though
she
could
not
have
answered
is
too
late
now
while
i
was
finishing
the
picture
i
saw
her
in
the
garden
her
spirit
all
in
white
with
a
blue
flower
in
her
belt
i
knew
she
was
dead
across
the
sea
i
tried
to
call
to
her
but
my
voice
made
no
sound
she
seemed
not
to
see
me
she
moved
like
one
in
a
dream
straight
on
and
vanished
is
there
no
one
who
can
tell
her
must
she
never
know
that
i
loved
her
the
last
thing
in
the
book
was
a
printed
scrap
of
paper
that
lay
between
the
leaves
irrevocable
the
gods
might
give
another
field
for
human
strife
man
must
live
one
life
ere
he
learns
to
live
ah
friend
in
thy
deep
grave
what
now
can
change
what
now
can
save
so
there
was
a
message
after
all
but
it
could
never
be
carried
a
task
for
a
friend
but
it
was
impossible
what
better
thing
could
i
do
with
the
poor
little
book
than
bury
it
in
the
garden
in
the
shadow
of
larmone
the
story
of
a
silent
fault
hidden
in
silence
how
many
of
life
deepest
tragedies
are
only
that
no
great
transgression
no
shock
of
conflict
no
sudden
catastrophe
with
its
answering
thrill
of
courage
and
resistance
only
a
mistake
made
in
the
darkness
and
under
the
guidance
of
what
seemed
a
true
and
noble
motive
a
failure
to
see
the
right
path
at
the
right
moment
and
a
long
wandering
beyond
it
a
word
left
unspoken
until
the
ears
that
should
have
heard
it
are
sealed
and
the
tongue
that
should
have
spoken
it
is
dumb
the
soft
clothed
the
night
with
clinging
darkness
the
faded
leaves
hung
slack
and
motionless
from
the
trees
waiting
for
their
fall
the
tense
notes
of
the
surf
beyond
the
vibrated
through
the
damp
air
like
chords
from
some
mighty
violono
large
warm
drops
wept
from
the
arbour
while
i
sat
in
the
garden
holding
the
poor
little
book
and
thinking
of
the
white
blot
in
the
record
of
a
life
that
was
too
proud
to
bend
to
the
happiness
that
was
meant
for
it
there
are
men
like
that
not
many
perhaps
but
a
few
and
they
are
the
ones
who
suffer
most
keenly
in
this
world
of
and
clouded
knowledge
there
is
a
pride
honourable
and
sensitive
that
imperils
the
realization
of
love
puts
it
under
a
spell
of
silence
and
reserve
makes
it
sterile
of
blossoms
and
impotent
of
fruits
for
what
is
it
after
all
but
a
subtle
spiritual
worship
of
self
and
what
was
falconer
resolve
not
to
tell
this
girl
that
he
loved
her
until
he
had
won
fame
and
position
but
a
secret
unconscious
setting
of
himself
above
her
for
surely
if
love
is
supreme
it
does
not
need
to
wait
for
anything
else
to
lend
it
worth
and
dignity
the
very
sweetness
and
power
of
it
lie
in
the
confession
of
one
life
as
dependent
upon
another
for
its
fulfilment
it
is
made
strong
in
its
very
weakness
it
is
the
only
thing
after
all
that
can
break
the
prison
bars
and
set
the
heart
free
from
itself
the
pride
that
hinders
it
enslaves
it
love
first
duty
is
to
be
true
to
itself
in
word
and
deed
then
having
spoken
truth
and
acted
verity
it
may
call
on
honour
to
keep
it
pure
and
steadfast
if
falconer
had
trusted
claire
and
showed
her
his
heart
without
reserve
would
she
not
have
understood
him
and
helped
him
it
was
the
pride
of
independence
the
passion
of
that
drew
him
away
from
her
and
divided
his
heart
from
hers
in
a
dumb
isolation
but
claire
was
not
she
also
in
fault
might
she
not
have
known
should
not
she
have
taken
for
granted
the
truth
which
must
have
been
so
easy
to
read
in
falconer
face
though
he
never
put
it
into
words
and
yet
with
her
there
was
something
very
different
from
the
pride
that
kept
him
silent
the
virgin
reserve
of
a
young
girl
heart
is
more
sacred
than
any
pride
of
self
it
is
the
maiden
instinct
which
makes
the
woman
always
the
shrine
and
never
the
pilgrim
she
is
not
the
seeker
but
the
one
sought
she
dares
not
take
anything
for
granted
she
has
the
right
to
wait
for
the
voice
the
word
the
avowal
then
and
not
till
then
if
the
pilgrim
be
the
chosen
one
the
shrine
may
open
to
receive
him
not
all
women
believe
this
but
those
who
do
are
the
ones
best
worth
seeking
and
winning
and
claire
was
one
of
them
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
mused
half
dreaming
on
the
unfinished
story
of
these
two
lives
that
had
missed
each
other
in
the
darkness
that
i
could
see
her
figure
moving
through
the
garden
beyond
where
the
pallid
bloom
of
the
tall
bent
to
the
fitful
breeze
her
robe
was
like
the
waving
of
the
mist
her
face
was
fair
and
very
fair
for
all
its
sadness
a
blue
flower
faint
as
a
shadow
on
the
snow
trembled
at
her
waist
as
she
paced
to
and
fro
along
the
path
i
murmured
to
myself
he
loved
her
and
she
loved
him
can
pride
be
stronger
than
love
perhaps
after
all
the
lingering
and
belated
confession
which
falconer
had
written
in
his
diary
might
in
some
way
come
to
her
perhaps
if
it
were
left
here
in
the
bower
of
honeysuckles
where
they
had
so
often
sat
together
it
might
be
a
sign
and
omen
of
the
meeting
of
these
two
souls
that
had
lost
each
other
in
the
dark
of
the
world
perhaps
ah
who
can
tell
that
it
is
not
so
for
those
who
truly
love
with
all
their
errors
with
all
their
faults
there
is
no
there
is
as
i
turned
from
the
garden
the
tense
note
of
the
surf
vibrated
through
the
night
the
pattering
drops
of
dew
rustled
as
they
fell
from
the
leaves
of
the
honeysuckle
but
underneath
these
sounds
it
seemed
as
if
i
heard
a
deep
voice
saying
and
a
woman
lips
whispering
vii
a
year
of
nobility
i
enter
the
marquis
the
marquis
sat
by
the
peeling
potatoes
to
look
at
him
you
never
would
have
taken
him
for
a
marquis
his
costume
was
a
pair
of
corduroy
trousers
a
blue
flannel
shirt
patched
at
elbows
with
gray
lumberman
boots
shapeless
with
loose
leather
legs
strapped
just
below
the
knee
and
wrinkled
like
the
hide
of
an
ancient
rhinoceros
and
a
soft
brown
hat
with
several
holes
in
the
crown
as
if
it
had
done
duty
at
some
time
in
its
history
as
an
impromptu
target
in
a
a
red
woollen
scarf
twisted
about
his
loins
gave
a
touch
of
colour
and
picturesqueness
it
was
not
exactly
a
court
dress
but
it
sat
well
on
the
powerful
sinewy
figure
of
the
man
he
never
gave
a
thought
to
his
looks
but
peeled
his
potatoes
with
a
dexterity
which
betrayed
a
of
the
humble
art
and
threw
the
skins
into
the
fire
you
he
said
to
young
winthrop
alden
who
sat
on
a
fallen
tree
near
him
mending
the
which
he
had
broken
in
the
morning
fishing
you
it
is
an
affair
of
the
most
strange
yet
of
the
most
certain
we
have
known
always
that
ours
was
a
good
family
the
name
tells
it
the
lamottes
are
of
la
haute
classe
in
france
but
here
in
canada
we
are
poor
yet
the
good
blood
dies
not
with
the
poverty
it
is
buried
hidden
but
it
remains
the
same
it
is
like
these
pataques
you
plant
good
ones
for
seed
you
get
a
good
crop
you
plant
bad
ones
you
get
a
bad
crop
but
we
did
not
know
about
the
title
in
our
family
no
we
thought
ours
was
a
an
it
was
a
great
surprise
to
us
but
it
is
certain
beyond
a
jean
lamotte
deep
voice
was
quiet
and
steady
it
had
the
tone
of
assured
conviction
his
bright
blue
eyes
above
his
ruddy
mustache
and
bronzed
cheeks
were
clear
and
tranquil
as
those
of
a
child
alden
was
immensely
interested
and
amused
he
was
a
member
of
the
boston
branch
of
the
society
for
ancestral
culture
and
he
recognized
the
favourite
tenet
of
his
sect
the
doctrine
that
will
he
was
also
a
harvard
man
knowing
almost
everything
and
believing
hardly
anything
heredity
was
one
of
the
few
unquestioned
articles
of
his
creed
but
the
form
in
which
this
familiar
confession
of
faith
came
to
him
on
the
banks
of
the
grande
decharge
from
the
lips
of
a
somewhat
ragged
and
distinctly
illiterate
canadian
guide
was
grotesque
enough
to
satisfy
the
most
modern
taste
for
new
sensations
he
listened
with
an
air
of
gravity
and
a
delighted
sense
of
the
humour
of
the
situation
did
you
find
it
out
he
asked
then
continued
jean
will
tell
you
how
the
news
came
to
me
it
was
at
gedeon
one
sunday
last
march
the
snow
was
good
and
hard
and
i
drove
in
ten
miles
on
the
lake
from
our
house
opposite
grosse
ile
after
mass
a
man
evidently
of
the
city
comes
to
me
in
the
stable
while
i
feed
the
horse
and
salutes
me
this
jean
lamotte
your
service
of
francois
louis
lamotte
no
other
but
he
is
dead
god
give
him
repose
been
looking
for
you
all
through
charlevoix
and
chicoutimi
you
find
me
then
and
to
you
says
i
a
little
short
for
i
was
beginning
to
be
shy
of
him
chut
says
he
very
friendly
suppose
you
have
time
to
talk
a
bit
how
would
you
like
to
be
a
marquis
and
have
a
castle
in
france
with
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
a
moment
i
think
i
will
lick
him
then
i
laugh
well
indeed
says
i
also
a
handful
of
stars
for
buckshot
and
the
new
moon
for
a
canoe
no
answers
the
man
am
earnest
monsieur
lamotte
i
want
to
talk
a
long
talk
with
you
do
you
permit
that
i
accompany
you
to
your
residence
you
know
that
little
of
logs
where
my
mother
lives
you
saw
it
last
summer
but
of
course
it
is
a
pretty
good
house
it
is
clean
it
is
warm
so
i
bring
the
man
home
in
the
sleigh
all
that
evening
he
tells
the
story
how
our
name
lamotte
is
really
de
la
motte
de
la
luciere
how
there
belongs
to
that
name
an
estate
and
a
title
in
france
now
thirty
years
with
no
one
to
claim
it
how
he
being
an
avocat
has
remarked
the
likeness
of
the
names
how
he
has
tracked
the
family
through
montmorency
and
quebec
in
all
the
parish
books
how
he
finds
my
etienne
de
la
motte
who
came
to
canada
two
hundred
years
ago
a
younger
son
of
the
marquis
de
la
luciere
how
he
has
the
papers
many
of
them
with
red
seals
on
them
i
saw
them
course
says
he
are
others
of
the
family
here
to
share
the
property
it
must
be
divided
but
it
is
large
enormous
millions
of
francs
and
the
largest
share
is
yours
and
the
title
and
a
castle
a
castle
larger
than
price
at
chicoutimi
with
carpets
and
electric
lights
and
coloured
pictures
on
the
wall
like
the
hotel
at
roberval
my
mother
heard
about
that
she
was
pleased
but
me
when
i
heard
that
i
was
a
marquis
i
knew
it
was
jean
blue
eyes
were
wide
open
now
and
sparkling
brightly
he
had
put
down
the
pan
of
potatoes
he
was
holding
his
head
up
and
talking
eagerly
alden
turned
away
his
face
to
light
his
pipe
and
hide
a
smile
he
get
any
money
out
of
you
came
slowly
between
the
puffs
of
smoke
answered
jean
course
there
must
be
money
to
carry
on
an
affair
of
this
kind
there
was
seventy
dollars
that
i
had
cleaned
up
on
the
last
winter
and
the
mother
had
forty
dollars
from
the
cow
she
sold
in
the
fall
a
hundred
and
ten
dollars
we
gave
him
that
he
has
gone
to
france
to
make
the
claim
for
us
next
spring
he
comes
back
and
i
give
him
a
hundred
dollars
more
when
i
get
my
property
five
thousand
dollars
more
it
is
little
enough
a
marquis
must
not
be
alden
swore
softly
in
english
under
his
breath
a
rustic
comedy
a
joke
on
human
nature
always
pleased
him
but
beneath
his
cynical
varnish
he
had
a
very
honest
heart
and
he
hated
cruelty
and
injustice
he
knew
what
a
little
money
meant
in
the
backwoods
what
hard
and
bitter
toil
it
cost
to
rake
it
together
what
sacrifices
and
privations
must
follow
its
loss
if
the
smooth
prospector
of
unclaimed
estates
in
france
had
arrived
at
the
camp
on
the
grande
decharge
at
that
moment
alden
would
have
introduced
him
to
the
most
unhappy
hour
of
his
life
but
with
jean
lamotte
it
was
by
no
means
so
easy
to
deal
alden
perceived
at
once
that
ridicule
would
be
worse
than
useless
the
man
was
far
too
much
in
earnest
a
jest
about
a
marquis
with
holes
in
his
hat
yes
jean
would
laugh
at
that
very
merrily
for
he
was
a
true
voyageur
but
a
jest
about
the
reality
of
the
marquis
that
struck
him
as
almost
profane
it
was
a
fixed
idea
with
him
argument
could
not
shake
it
he
had
seen
the
papers
he
knew
it
was
true
all
the
strength
of
his
vigorous
and
healthy
manhood
seemed
to
have
gone
into
it
suddenly
as
if
this
was
the
news
for
which
he
had
been
waiting
unconsciously
since
he
was
born
it
was
not
in
the
least
morbid
visionary
abstract
it
was
concrete
actual
and
so
far
as
alden
could
see
wholesome
it
did
not
make
jean
despise
his
present
life
on
the
contrary
it
appeared
to
lend
a
zest
to
it
as
an
interesting
episode
in
the
career
of
a
nobleman
he
was
not
restless
he
was
not
discontented
his
whole
nature
was
at
once
elated
and
calmed
he
was
not
at
all
feverish
to
get
away
from
his
familiar
existence
from
the
woods
and
the
waters
he
knew
so
well
from
the
large
liberty
of
the
unpeopled
forest
the
joyous
rush
of
the
great
river
the
splendid
breadth
of
the
open
sky
unconsciously
these
things
had
gone
into
his
blood
dimly
he
felt
the
premonitions
of
homesickness
for
them
all
but
he
was
lifted
up
to
remember
that
the
blood
into
which
these
things
had
entered
was
blue
blood
and
that
though
he
lived
in
the
wilderness
he
really
belonged
to
la
haute
classe
a
breath
of
romance
a
spirit
of
chivalry
from
the
days
when
the
courtiers
of
louis
xiv
sought
their
fortune
in
the
new
world
seemed
to
pass
into
him
he
spoke
of
it
all
with
a
kind
of
proud
simplicity
appears
curious
to
no
doubt
but
it
has
been
so
in
canada
from
the
beginning
there
were
many
nobles
here
in
the
old
time
frontenac
he
was
a
duke
or
a
prince
denonville
he
was
a
grand
seigneur
la
salle
vaudreuil
these
are
all
noble
counts
or
barons
i
know
not
the
difference
but
the
cure
has
told
me
the
names
and
the
old
jacques
cartier
the
father
of
all
when
he
went
home
to
france
i
have
heard
that
the
king
made
him
a
lord
and
gave
him
a
castle
why
not
he
was
a
capable
man
a
brave
man
he
could
sail
a
big
ship
he
could
run
the
rapids
of
the
great
river
in
his
canoe
he
could
hunt
the
bear
the
lynx
the
carcajou
i
suppose
all
these
men
marquises
and
counts
and
barons
i
suppose
they
all
lived
hard
and
slept
on
the
ground
and
used
the
axe
and
the
paddle
when
they
came
to
the
woods
it
is
not
the
fine
coat
that
makes
the
noble
it
is
the
good
blood
the
adventure
the
brave
thought
alden
is
the
real
thing
a
bit
of
the
seventeenth
century
lost
in
the
forest
for
two
hundred
years
it
is
like
finding
an
old
rapier
beside
an
indian
trail
i
suppose
the
fellow
may
be
the
descendant
of
some
gay
young
lieutenant
of
the
regiment
who
came
out
with
de
tracy
or
courcelles
an
amour
with
the
daughter
of
a
habitant
a
name
taken
at
random
who
can
unravel
the
skein
but
here
the
old
thread
of
chivalry
running
through
all
the
tangles
tarnished
but
this
was
what
he
said
to
himself
what
he
said
to
jean
was
jean
you
and
i
have
been
together
in
the
woods
for
two
summers
now
and
marquis
or
no
marquis
i
hope
this
is
not
going
to
make
any
difference
between
certainly
not
answered
jean
am
well
content
with
as
i
hope
is
content
with
me
while
i
am
au
bois
i
ask
no
better
than
to
be
your
guide
besides
i
must
earn
those
other
hundred
dollars
for
the
payment
in
the
alden
tried
to
make
him
promise
to
give
nothing
more
to
the
lawyer
until
he
had
something
sure
to
show
for
his
money
but
jean
was
politely
on
that
point
it
was
evident
that
he
felt
the
impossibility
of
meanness
in
a
marquis
why
should
he
be
sparing
or
cautious
that
was
for
the
merchant
not
for
the
noble
a
hundred
two
hundred
three
hundred
dollars
what
was
that
to
an
estate
and
a
title
nothing
risk
nothing
gain
he
must
live
up
to
his
role
meantime
he
was
ready
to
prove
that
he
was
the
best
guide
on
the
grande
decharge
and
so
he
was
there
was
not
a
man
in
all
the
lake
john
country
who
knew
the
woods
and
waters
as
well
as
he
did
far
up
the
great
rivers
peribonca
and
misstassini
he
had
pushed
his
birch
canoe
exploring
the
network
of
lakes
and
streams
along
the
desolate
height
of
land
he
knew
the
grand
brule
where
the
bears
roam
in
september
on
the
hills
among
the
wide
unharvested
fields
of
blueberries
he
knew
the
hidden
ponds
and
little
rivers
where
the
beavers
build
their
dams
and
raise
their
silent
like
venice
lost
in
the
woods
he
knew
the
vast
barrens
covered
with
stiff
silvery
moss
where
the
caribou
fed
in
the
winter
on
the
decharge
itself
that
tumultuous
flood
never
failing
never
freezing
by
which
the
great
lake
pours
all
its
gathered
waters
in
foam
and
fury
down
to
the
deep
still
gorge
of
the
saguenay
there
jean
was
at
home
there
was
not
a
curl
or
eddy
in
the
wild
course
of
the
river
that
he
did
not
understand
the
quiet
little
channels
by
which
one
could
drop
down
behind
the
islands
while
the
main
stream
made
an
impassable
fall
the
precise
height
of
the
water
at
which
it
was
safe
to
run
the
rapide
gervais
the
point
of
rock
on
the
brink
of
the
grande
chute
where
the
canoe
must
whirl
swiftly
in
to
the
shore
if
you
did
not
wish
to
go
over
the
cataract
the
exact
force
of
the
tourniquet
that
sucked
downward
at
one
edge
of
the
rapid
and
of
the
bouillon
that
boiled
upward
at
the
other
edge
as
if
the
bottom
of
the
river
were
heaving
and
the
narrow
line
of
the
filet
along
which
the
might
shoot
in
safety
the
treachery
of
the
smooth
oily
curves
where
the
brown
water
swept
past
the
edge
of
the
cliff
silent
gloomy
menacing
the
hidden
pathway
through
the
foam
where
the
canoe
could
run
out
securely
and
reach
a
favourite
haunt
of
the
ouananiche
the
fish
that
loves
the
wildest
water
all
these
secrets
were
known
to
jean
he
read
the
river
like
a
book
he
loved
it
he
also
respected
it
he
knew
it
too
well
to
take
liberties
with
it
the
camp
that
june
was
beside
the
rapide
des
cedres
a
great
ledge
stretched
across
the
river
the
water
came
down
in
three
leaps
brown
above
golden
at
the
edge
white
where
it
fell
below
on
the
left
bank
there
was
a
little
cove
behind
a
high
point
of
rocks
a
curving
beach
of
white
sand
a
gentle
slope
of
ground
a
tent
half
hidden
among
the
birches
and
balsams
down
the
river
the
main
channel
narrowed
and
deepened
high
banks
hemmed
it
in
on
the
left
islands
on
the
right
it
was
a
sullen
powerful
dangerous
stream
beyond
that
in
the
ile
maligne
reared
its
wicked
head
scarred
bristling
with
skeletons
of
dead
trees
on
either
side
of
it
the
river
broke
away
into
a
long
fury
of
rapids
and
falls
in
which
no
boat
could
live
it
was
there
on
the
point
of
the
island
that
the
most
famous
fishing
in
the
river
was
found
and
there
alden
was
determined
to
cast
his
fly
before
he
went
home
ten
days
they
had
waited
at
the
cedars
for
the
water
to
fall
enough
to
make
the
passage
to
the
island
safe
at
last
alden
grew
impatient
it
was
a
superb
morning
sky
like
an
immense
blue
gentian
air
full
of
fragrance
from
a
million
bells
of
pink
linnaea
sunshine
flattering
the
great
river
a
morning
when
danger
and
death
seemed
incredible
we
are
going
to
the
island
jean
the
water
must
be
low
enough
yet
i
am
sorry
but
it
is
not
alden
laughed
rather
unpleasantly
believe
you
are
afraid
i
thought
you
were
a
good
canoeman
am
that
said
jean
quietly
therefore
well
it
is
the
bad
canoeman
who
is
never
last
september
you
took
your
monsieur
to
the
island
and
gave
him
fine
fishing
why
wo
you
do
it
for
me
i
believe
you
want
to
keep
me
away
from
this
place
and
save
it
for
jean
face
flushed
has
no
reason
to
say
that
of
me
i
beg
that
he
will
not
repeat
alden
laughed
again
he
was
somewhat
irritated
at
jean
for
taking
the
thing
so
seriously
for
being
so
obstinate
on
such
a
morning
it
was
absurd
at
least
it
would
do
no
harm
to
make
an
effort
to
reach
the
island
if
it
proved
impossible
they
could
give
it
up
right
jean
he
said
take
it
back
you
are
only
timid
that
all
francois
here
will
go
down
with
me
we
can
manage
the
canoe
together
jean
can
stay
at
home
and
keep
the
camp
eh
francois
francois
the
second
guide
was
a
mush
of
vanity
and
good
nature
with
just
sense
enough
to
obey
jean
orders
and
just
jealousy
enough
to
make
him
jump
at
a
chance
to
show
his
independence
he
would
like
very
well
to
be
first
man
for
a
day
perhaps
for
the
next
trip
if
he
had
good
luck
he
grinned
and
nodded
his
head
ready
i
guess
we
can
do
but
while
he
was
holding
the
canoe
steady
for
alden
to
step
out
to
his
place
in
the
bow
jean
came
down
and
pushed
him
aside
to
bed
fool
he
muttered
shoved
the
canoe
out
into
the
river
and
jumped
lightly
to
his
own
place
in
the
stern
alden
smiled
to
himself
and
said
nothing
for
a
while
when
they
were
a
mile
or
two
down
the
river
he
remarked
i
see
you
changed
your
mind
jean
do
you
think
better
of
the
river
now
i
think
the
then
i
must
share
the
luck
with
you
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
it
is
no
shame
to
have
fear
the
shame
is
not
to
face
it
but
one
thing
i
ask
of
you
that
is
as
low
in
the
canoe
as
you
can
paddle
steady
and
do
not
dodge
when
a
wave
alden
was
half
inclined
to
turn
back
and
give
it
up
but
pride
made
it
difficult
to
say
the
word
besides
the
fishing
was
sure
to
be
superb
not
a
line
had
been
wet
there
since
last
year
it
was
worth
a
little
risk
the
danger
could
not
be
so
very
great
after
all
how
fair
the
river
ran
a
current
of
living
topaz
between
banks
of
emerald
what
but
good
luck
could
come
on
such
a
day
the
canoe
was
gliding
down
the
last
smooth
stretch
alden
lifted
his
head
as
they
turned
the
corner
and
for
the
first
time
saw
the
passage
close
before
him
his
face
went
white
and
he
set
his
teeth
the
branch
of
the
river
cleft
by
the
rocky
point
of
the
island
dropped
at
once
into
a
tumult
of
yellow
foam
and
raved
downward
along
the
northern
shore
the
branch
swerved
away
to
the
east
running
with
swift
silent
fury
on
the
lower
edge
of
this
desperate
race
of
brown
billows
a
huge
whirlpool
formed
and
dissolved
every
two
or
three
minutes
now
eddying
round
in
a
wide
backwater
into
a
rocky
bay
on
the
end
of
the
island
now
swept
away
by
the
rush
of
waves
into
the
white
rage
of
the
rapids
below
there
was
the
secret
pathway
the
trick
was
to
dart
across
the
current
at
the
proper
moment
catch
the
rim
of
the
whirlpool
as
it
swung
backward
and
let
it
sweep
you
around
to
the
end
of
the
island
it
was
easy
enough
at
low
water
but
now
the
smooth
waves
went
crowding
and
shouldering
down
the
slope
as
if
they
were
running
to
a
fight
the
river
rose
and
swelled
with
quick
uneven
passion
the
whirlpool
was
in
its
place
one
minute
the
next
it
was
blotted
out
everything
rushed
madly
downward
and
below
was
hell
jean
checked
the
boat
for
a
moment
quivering
in
the
strong
current
waiting
for
the
tourniquet
to
form
again
five
seconds
ten
seconds
he
cried
the
canoe
shot
obliquely
into
the
stream
driven
by
strong
quick
strokes
of
the
paddles
it
seemed
almost
to
leap
from
wave
to
wave
all
was
going
well
the
edge
of
the
whirlpool
was
near
then
came
the
crest
of
a
larger
wave
slap
into
the
boat
alden
shrank
involuntarily
from
the
cold
water
and
missed
his
stroke
an
eddy
caught
the
bow
and
shoved
it
out
the
whirlpool
receded
dissolved
the
whole
river
rushed
down
upon
the
canoe
and
carried
it
away
like
a
leaf
who
says
that
thought
is
swift
and
clear
in
a
moment
like
that
who
talks
about
the
whole
of
a
man
life
passing
before
him
in
a
flash
of
light
a
flash
of
darkness
thought
is
paralyzed
dumb
a
fool
that
is
about
all
it
can
say
and
if
the
moment
is
prolonged
it
says
the
same
thing
over
again
stunned
bewildered
impotent
then
the
rocking
waves
the
sinking
boat
the
roar
of
the
fall
the
swift
overturn
the
icy
blinding
strangling
water
god
jean
was
flung
shoreward
instinctively
he
struck
out
with
the
current
and
half
across
it
toward
a
point
of
rock
his
foot
touched
bottom
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
back
the
canoe
was
sweeping
past
bottom
upward
alden
underneath
it
jean
thrust
himself
out
into
the
stream
again
still
going
with
the
current
but
now
away
from
shore
he
gripped
the
canoe
flinging
his
arm
over
the
stern
then
he
got
hold
of
the
thwart
and
tried
to
turn
it
over
too
heavy
groping
underneath
he
caught
alden
by
the
shoulder
and
pulled
him
out
they
would
have
gone
down
together
but
for
the
boat
on
tight
gasped
jean
your
arm
over
the
canoe
the
other
side
alden
half
dazed
obeyed
him
the
torrent
carried
the
dancing
slippery
bark
past
another
point
just
below
it
there
was
a
little
eddy
cried
jean
strike
for
the
land
they
touched
the
black
gliddery
rocks
they
staggered
out
of
the
water
falling
and
rising
again
they
crawled
up
on
the
warm
moss
the
first
thing
that
alden
noticed
was
the
line
of
bright
red
spots
on
the
wing
of
a
fluttering
silently
through
the
branches
of
the
tree
above
him
he
lay
still
and
watched
it
wondering
that
he
had
never
before
observed
those
brilliant
sparks
of
colour
on
the
little
brown
bird
then
he
wondered
what
made
his
legs
ache
so
then
he
saw
jean
dripping
wet
sitting
on
a
stone
and
looking
down
the
river
he
got
up
painfully
and
went
over
to
him
he
put
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
you
saved
my
life
i
thank
you
marquis
said
jean
springing
up
beg
you
not
to
mention
it
it
was
nothing
a
narrow
shave
but
la
bonne
chance
and
after
all
you
were
right
we
got
to
the
island
but
now
how
to
get
off
ii
an
alliance
of
rivals
yes
of
course
they
got
off
the
next
day
at
the
foot
of
the
island
two
miles
below
there
is
a
place
where
the
water
runs
quieter
and
a
bateau
can
cross
from
the
main
shore
francois
was
frightened
when
the
others
did
not
come
back
in
the
evening
he
made
his
way
around
to
joseph
and
got
a
boat
to
come
up
and
look
for
their
bodies
he
found
them
on
the
shore
alive
and
very
hungry
but
all
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
story
nor
does
it
make
any
difference
how
alden
spent
the
rest
of
his
summer
in
the
woods
what
kind
of
fishing
he
had
or
what
moved
him
to
leave
five
hundred
dollars
with
jean
when
he
went
away
that
is
all
padding
leave
it
out
the
first
point
of
interest
is
what
jean
did
with
the
money
a
suit
of
clothes
a
new
stove
and
a
set
of
kitchen
utensils
for
the
log
house
opposite
grosse
ile
a
trip
to
quebec
a
little
game
of
in
the
back
room
of
the
hotel
du
nord
that
was
the
end
of
the
money
this
is
not
a
story
jean
was
no
saint
even
as
a
hero
he
had
his
weak
points
but
after
his
own
fashion
he
was
a
pretty
good
kind
of
a
marquis
he
took
his
headache
the
next
morning
as
a
matter
of
course
and
his
empty
pocket
as
a
trick
of
fortune
with
the
nobility
he
knew
very
well
such
things
often
happen
but
the
nobility
do
not
complain
about
it
they
go
ahead
as
if
it
was
a
bagatelle
before
the
week
was
out
jean
was
on
his
way
to
a
on
the
maurice
river
to
cook
for
a
crew
of
thirty
men
all
winter
the
cook
position
in
camp
is
curious
half
menial
half
superior
it
is
no
place
for
a
feeble
man
but
a
cook
who
is
strong
in
the
back
and
quick
with
his
fists
can
make
his
office
much
respected
wages
forty
dollars
a
month
duties
to
keep
the
kettle
always
hot
and
the
always
full
to
stand
the
jokes
of
the
camp
up
to
a
certain
point
and
after
that
to
whip
two
or
three
of
the
most
active
humourists
jean
performed
all
his
duties
to
perfect
satisfaction
naturally
most
of
the
jokes
turned
upon
his
great
expectations
with
two
of
the
principal
jokers
he
had
exchanged
the
usual
and
conclusive
form
of
repartee
flattened
them
out
literally
the
ordinary
badinage
he
did
not
mind
in
the
least
it
rather
pleased
him
but
about
the
first
of
january
a
new
hand
came
into
the
camp
a
big
fellow
from
three
rivers
pierre
lamotte
dit
theophile
with
him
it
was
different
there
seemed
to
be
something
serious
in
his
jests
about
it
was
not
fun
it
was
mockery
always
on
the
edge
of
anger
he
acted
as
if
he
would
be
glad
to
make
jean
ridiculous
in
any
way
finally
the
matter
came
to
a
head
something
happened
to
the
soup
one
sunday
morning
tobacco
probably
certainly
it
was
very
bad
only
fit
to
throw
away
and
the
whole
camp
was
mad
it
was
not
really
pierre
who
played
the
trick
but
it
was
he
who
sneered
that
the
camp
would
be
better
off
if
the
cook
knew
less
about
castles
and
more
about
cooking
jean
answered
that
what
the
camp
needed
was
to
get
rid
of
a
badreux
who
thought
it
was
a
joke
to
poison
the
soup
pierre
took
this
as
a
personal
allusion
and
requested
him
to
discuss
the
question
outside
but
before
the
discussion
began
he
made
some
general
remarks
about
the
character
and
pretensions
of
jean
marquis
said
he
bagoulard
gives
himself
out
for
a
marquis
he
is
nothing
of
the
kind
a
rank
humbug
there
is
a
title
in
the
family
an
estate
in
france
it
is
true
but
it
is
mine
i
have
seen
the
papers
i
have
paid
money
to
the
lawyer
i
am
waiting
now
for
him
to
arrange
the
matter
this
man
knows
nothing
about
it
he
is
a
fraud
i
will
fight
him
now
and
settle
the
if
a
bucket
of
had
been
thrown
over
jean
he
could
not
have
cooled
off
more
suddenly
he
was
dazed
another
marquis
this
was
a
complication
he
had
never
dreamed
of
it
overwhelmed
him
like
an
avalanche
he
must
have
time
to
dig
himself
out
of
this
difficulty
stop
he
cried
go
too
fast
this
is
more
serious
than
a
pot
of
soup
i
must
hear
about
this
let
us
talk
first
pierre
and
afterwards
the
camp
was
delighted
it
was
a
fine
comedy
two
fools
instead
of
one
the
men
pricked
up
their
ears
and
clamoured
for
a
full
explanation
a
debate
in
open
court
but
that
was
not
jean
way
he
had
made
no
secret
of
his
expectations
but
he
did
not
care
to
confide
all
the
details
of
his
family
history
to
a
crowd
of
fellows
who
would
probably
not
understand
and
would
certainly
laugh
pierre
was
wrong
of
course
but
at
least
he
was
in
earnest
that
was
something
affair
is
between
pierre
and
me
said
jean
shall
speak
of
it
by
in
the
forest
that
afternoon
where
the
great
rose
like
pillars
of
black
granite
from
a
marble
floor
and
the
branches
of
spruce
and
fir
wove
a
dark
green
roof
above
their
heads
these
two
stray
shoots
of
a
noble
stock
tried
to
untangle
their
family
history
it
was
little
that
they
knew
about
it
they
could
get
back
to
their
grandfathers
but
beyond
that
the
trail
was
rather
blind
where
they
crossed
neither
jean
nor
pierre
could
tell
in
fact
both
of
their
minds
had
been
empty
vessels
for
the
plausible
lawyer
to
fill
and
he
had
filled
them
with
various
and
windy
stuff
there
were
discrepancies
and
contradictions
denials
and
disputes
flashes
of
anger
and
clouds
of
suspicion
but
through
all
the
voluble
talk
somehow
or
other
the
two
men
were
drawing
closer
together
pierre
felt
jean
force
of
character
his
air
of
natural
leadership
his
bonhommie
he
thought
was
a
shame
for
that
lawyer
to
trick
such
a
fine
fellow
with
the
story
that
he
was
the
heir
of
the
jean
for
his
part
was
impressed
by
simplicity
and
firmness
of
conviction
he
thought
a
mean
thing
for
that
lawyer
to
fool
such
an
innocent
as
this
into
supposing
himself
the
inheritor
of
the
what
never
occurred
to
either
of
them
was
the
idea
that
the
lawyer
had
deceived
them
both
that
was
not
to
be
dreamed
of
to
admit
such
a
thought
would
have
seemed
to
them
like
throwing
away
something
of
great
value
which
they
had
just
found
the
family
name
the
papers
the
links
of
the
genealogy
which
had
been
so
convincingly
set
forth
all
this
had
made
an
impression
on
their
imagination
stronger
than
any
logical
argument
but
which
was
the
marquis
that
was
the
question
here
said
jean
at
last
what
value
is
it
that
we
fight
we
are
cousins
you
think
i
am
wrong
i
think
you
are
wrong
but
one
of
us
must
be
right
who
can
tell
there
will
certainly
be
something
for
both
of
us
blood
is
stronger
than
currant
juice
let
us
work
together
and
help
each
other
you
come
home
with
me
when
this
job
is
done
the
lawyer
returns
to
gedeon
in
the
spring
he
will
know
we
can
see
him
together
if
he
has
fooled
you
you
can
do
what
you
like
to
him
when
pardon
i
mean
if
i
get
the
title
i
will
do
the
fair
thing
by
you
you
shall
do
the
same
by
me
is
it
a
bargain
on
this
basis
the
compact
was
made
the
camp
was
much
amazed
not
to
say
disgusted
because
there
was
no
fight
efforts
were
made
at
intervals
through
the
winter
to
bring
on
a
crisis
but
nothing
came
of
it
the
rival
claimants
had
pooled
their
stock
they
acknowledged
the
tie
of
blood
and
ignored
the
clash
of
interests
together
they
faced
the
fire
of
jokes
and
stood
off
the
crowd
pierre
frowning
and
belligerent
jean
smiling
and
scornful
practically
they
bossed
the
camp
they
were
the
only
men
who
always
shaved
on
sunday
morning
this
was
regarded
as
foppish
the
popular
disappointment
deepened
into
a
general
sense
of
injury
in
march
when
the
cut
of
timber
was
finished
and
the
logs
were
all
hauled
to
the
edge
of
the
river
to
lie
there
until
the
ice
should
break
and
the
begin
the
time
arrived
for
the
camp
to
close
the
last
night
under
the
inspiration
drawn
from
sundry
bottles
which
had
been
smuggled
in
to
celebrate
the
occasion
a
plan
was
concocted
in
the
stables
to
humble
with
a
grand
display
of
humour
jean
was
to
be
crowned
as
marquis
with
a
bridle
and
blinders
pierre
was
to
be
anointed
as
count
with
a
dipperful
of
after
that
the
fun
would
be
impromptu
the
impromptu
part
of
the
programme
began
earlier
than
it
was
advertised
some
whisper
of
the
plan
had
leaked
through
the
chinks
of
the
wall
between
the
shanty
and
the
stable
when
the
crowd
came
shambling
into
the
cabin
snickering
and
nudging
one
another
jean
and
pierre
were
standing
by
the
stove
at
the
upper
end
of
the
long
table
with
the
canaille
shouted
jean
out
the
gang
responded
pierre
brandishing
they
charged
down
the
sides
of
the
table
the
mob
wavered
turned
and
were
lost
they
fled
tumbling
over
one
another
in
their
haste
to
escape
the
lamp
was
smashed
the
benches
were
upset
in
the
smoky
hall
a
furious
din
arose
as
if
sir
galahad
and
sir
percivale
were
once
more
hewing
their
way
through
the
castle
of
carteloise
fear
fell
upon
the
multitude
and
they
cried
aloud
grievously
in
their
dismay
the
blows
of
the
weapons
echoed
mightily
in
the
darkness
and
the
two
knights
laid
about
them
grimly
and
with
great
joy
the
door
was
too
narrow
for
the
flight
some
of
the
men
crept
under
the
lowest
berths
others
hid
beneath
the
table
two
endeavouring
to
escape
by
the
windows
stuck
fast
exposing
a
broad
and
undefended
mark
to
the
pursuers
here
the
last
strokes
of
the
conflict
were
delivered
for
the
marquis
cried
jean
bringing
down
his
weapon
with
a
sounding
whack
for
the
count
cried
pierre
making
his
pan
crack
like
the
blow
of
a
beaver
tail
when
he
dives
then
they
went
out
into
the
snowy
night
and
sat
down
together
on
the
sill
of
the
and
laughed
until
the
tears
ran
down
their
cheeks
faith
said
jean
was
like
the
ancient
time
it
is
from
the
good
wood
that
strong
paddles
are
made
eh
cousin
and
after
that
there
was
a
friendship
between
the
two
men
that
could
not
have
been
cut
with
the
sharpest
axe
in
quebec
iii
a
happy
ending
which
is
also
a
beginning
the
plan
of
going
back
to
gedeon
to
wait
for
the
return
of
the
lawyer
was
not
carried
out
several
of
the
little
gods
that
use
their
own
indiscretion
in
arranging
the
pieces
on
the
of
life
interfered
with
it
the
first
to
meddle
was
that
highly
irresponsible
deity
with
the
bow
and
arrows
who
has
no
respect
for
rank
or
age
but
reserves
all
his
attention
for
sex
when
the
camp
on
the
maurice
dissolved
jean
went
down
with
pierre
to
three
rivers
for
a
short
visit
there
was
a
snug
house
on
a
high
bank
above
the
river
a
couple
of
miles
from
the
town
a
wife
and
an
armful
of
children
gave
assurance
that
the
race
of
la
motte
de
la
luciere
should
not
die
out
on
this
side
of
the
ocean
there
was
also
a
little
alma
grenou
if
you
had
seen
her
you
would
not
have
wondered
at
what
happened
eyes
like
a
deer
face
like
a
mayflower
voice
like
the
string
in
a
she
was
the
picture
of
drummond
girl
in
nicer
girl
on
whole
comte
an
jus
got
eighteen
year
black
eye
black
hair
and
cheek
rosee
dat
lak
wan
fameuse
on
de
fall
but
do
spik
much
not
of
dat
kin
i
ca
say
she
love
me
at
with
her
jean
plunged
into
love
it
was
not
a
gradual
approach
like
gliding
down
a
smooth
stream
it
was
not
a
swift
descent
like
running
a
lively
rapid
it
was
a
veritable
plunge
like
going
over
a
chute
he
did
not
know
precisely
what
had
happened
to
him
at
first
but
he
knew
very
soon
what
to
do
about
it
the
return
to
lake
john
was
postponed
till
a
more
convenient
season
after
the
snow
had
melted
and
the
ice
had
broken
up
probably
the
lawyer
would
not
make
his
visit
before
that
if
he
arrived
sooner
he
would
come
back
again
he
wanted
his
money
that
was
certain
besides
what
was
more
likely
than
that
he
should
come
also
to
see
pierre
he
had
promised
to
do
so
at
all
events
they
would
wait
at
three
rivers
for
a
while
the
first
week
jean
told
alma
that
she
was
the
prettiest
girl
he
had
ever
seen
she
tossed
her
head
and
expressed
a
conviction
that
he
was
joking
she
suggested
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
the
same
thing
to
every
girl
the
second
week
he
made
a
long
stride
in
his
wooing
he
took
her
out
sleighing
on
the
last
remnant
of
the
snow
very
thin
and
bumpy
and
utilized
the
occasion
to
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
she
cried
tranquille
jean
boxed
his
ears
and
said
she
thought
he
must
be
out
of
his
mind
the
following
saturday
afternoon
he
craftily
came
behind
her
in
the
stable
as
she
was
milking
the
cow
and
bent
her
head
back
and
kissed
her
on
the
face
she
began
to
cry
and
said
he
had
taken
an
unfair
advantage
while
her
hands
were
busy
she
hated
him
then
said
he
still
holding
her
warm
shoulders
you
hate
me
i
am
going
home
the
sobs
calmed
down
quickly
she
bent
herself
forward
so
that
he
could
see
the
rosy
nape
of
her
neck
with
the
curling
tendrils
of
brown
hair
around
it
she
said
jean
do
you
love
me
for
sure
after
that
the
path
was
level
easy
and
very
quickly
travelled
on
sunday
afternoon
the
priest
was
notified
that
his
services
would
be
needed
for
a
wedding
the
first
week
in
may
pierre
consent
was
genial
and
hilarious
the
marriage
suited
him
exactly
it
was
a
family
alliance
it
made
everything
move
smooth
and
certain
the
property
would
be
kept
together
but
the
other
little
interfering
gods
had
not
yet
been
heard
from
one
of
them
who
had
special
charge
of
what
remained
of
the
soul
of
the
dealer
in
unclaimed
estates
put
it
into
his
head
to
go
to
three
rivers
first
instead
of
to
gedeon
he
had
a
good
many
clients
in
different
parts
of
the
country
temporary
clients
of
course
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
as
well
extract
another
fifty
dollars
from
pierre
lamotte
dit
theophile
before
going
on
a
longer
journey
on
his
way
down
from
montreal
he
stopped
in
several
small
towns
and
slept
in
beds
of
various
quality
another
of
the
little
deities
the
one
that
presides
over
unclean
villages
decidedly
a
false
god
but
sufficiently
powerful
arranged
a
surprise
for
the
travelling
lawyer
it
came
out
at
three
rivers
he
arrived
about
nightfall
and
slept
at
the
hotel
feeling
curiously
depressed
the
next
morning
he
was
worse
but
he
was
a
resolute
and
industrious
dog
after
his
own
fashion
so
he
hired
a
buggy
and
drove
out
through
the
mud
to
pierre
place
they
heard
the
wagon
stop
at
the
gate
and
went
out
to
see
who
it
was
the
man
was
hardly
recognizable
face
pale
lips
blue
eyes
dull
teeth
chattering
me
out
of
this
he
muttered
am
dying
god
sake
be
quick
they
helped
him
to
the
house
and
he
immediately
went
into
a
convulsion
from
this
he
passed
into
a
raging
fever
pierre
took
the
buggy
and
drove
posthaste
to
town
for
a
doctor
the
doctor
opinion
was
evidently
serious
but
his
remarks
were
him
in
this
room
give
him
ten
drops
of
this
in
water
every
hour
one
of
these
powders
if
he
becomes
violent
one
of
you
must
stay
with
him
all
the
time
only
one
you
understand
the
rest
keep
away
i
will
come
back
in
the
in
the
morning
the
doctor
face
was
yet
more
grave
he
examined
the
patient
carefully
then
he
turned
to
jean
who
had
acted
as
nurse
thought
so
said
he
must
all
be
vaccinated
immediately
there
is
still
time
i
hope
but
what
to
do
with
this
gentleman
god
knows
we
ca
send
him
back
to
the
town
he
has
the
that
was
a
pretty
prelude
to
a
wedding
festival
they
were
all
at
their
wit
end
while
the
doctor
scratched
their
arms
they
discussed
the
situation
excitedly
and
with
desperation
jean
was
the
first
to
stop
chattering
and
begin
to
think
is
that
old
cabane
of
poulin
up
the
road
it
is
empty
these
three
years
but
there
is
a
good
spring
of
water
one
could
patch
the
roof
at
one
end
and
put
up
a
said
the
doctor
some
one
to
take
care
of
him
it
will
be
a
long
job
and
a
bad
am
going
to
do
that
said
jean
is
my
place
this
gentleman
can
not
be
left
to
die
in
the
road
le
bon
dieu
did
not
send
him
here
for
that
the
head
of
the
here
he
stopped
a
moment
and
looked
at
pierre
who
was
silent
take
the
heavy
end
of
the
job
and
i
am
ready
for
said
the
doctor
again
but
alma
was
crying
in
the
corner
of
the
room
four
weeks
five
weeks
six
weeks
the
vigil
in
the
cabane
lasted
the
last
patches
of
snow
disappeared
from
the
fields
one
night
as
if
winter
had
picked
up
its
rags
and
vanished
the
willows
along
the
brook
turned
yellow
the
grass
greened
around
the
spring
scarlet
buds
flamed
on
the
swamp
maples
a
tender
mist
of
foliage
spread
over
the
woodlands
the
chokecherries
burst
into
a
glory
of
white
blossoms
the
bluebirds
came
back
fluting
and
the
robins
carolling
ballads
of
joy
and
the
blackbirds
creaking
merrily
the
priest
came
once
and
saw
the
sick
man
but
everything
was
going
well
it
was
not
necessary
to
run
any
extra
risks
every
week
after
that
he
came
and
leaned
on
the
fence
talking
with
jean
in
the
doorway
when
he
went
away
he
always
lifted
three
fingers
so
you
know
the
sign
it
is
a
very
pleasant
one
and
it
did
jean
heart
good
pierre
kept
the
cabane
well
supplied
with
provisions
leaving
them
just
inside
of
the
gate
but
with
the
milk
it
was
necessary
to
be
a
little
careful
so
the
can
was
kept
in
a
place
by
itself
under
the
oven
in
the
shade
and
beside
this
can
jean
would
find
every
day
something
particular
a
blossom
of
the
red
geranium
that
bloomed
in
the
farmhouse
window
a
piece
of
cake
with
plums
in
it
a
bunch
of
trailing
arbutus
once
it
was
a
little
bit
of
blue
ribbon
tied
in
a
certain
square
knot
so
perhaps
you
know
that
sign
too
that
did
jean
heart
good
also
but
what
kind
of
conversation
was
there
in
the
cabane
when
the
sick
man
delirium
had
passed
and
he
knew
what
had
happened
to
him
not
much
at
first
for
the
man
was
too
weak
after
he
began
to
get
stronger
he
was
thinking
a
great
deal
fighting
with
himself
in
the
end
he
came
out
pretty
well
for
a
lawyer
of
his
kind
perhaps
he
was
desirous
to
leave
the
man
whom
he
had
deceived
and
who
had
nursed
him
back
from
death
some
fragment
as
much
as
possible
of
the
dream
that
brightened
his
life
perhaps
he
was
only
anxious
to
save
as
much
as
he
could
of
his
own
reputation
at
all
events
this
is
what
he
did
he
told
jean
a
long
story
part
truth
part
lie
about
his
investigations
the
estate
and
the
title
were
in
the
family
that
was
certain
jean
was
the
probable
heir
if
there
was
any
heir
that
was
almost
sure
the
part
about
pierre
had
been
a
well
a
mistake
but
the
trouble
with
the
whole
affair
was
this
a
law
made
in
the
days
of
napoleon
limited
the
time
for
which
an
estate
could
remain
unclaimed
a
certain
number
of
years
and
then
the
government
took
everything
that
number
of
years
had
just
passed
by
the
old
law
jean
was
probably
a
marquis
with
a
castle
by
the
new
law
frankly
he
could
not
advise
a
client
to
incur
any
more
expense
in
fact
he
intended
to
return
the
amount
already
paid
a
hundred
and
ten
dollars
was
it
not
yes
and
fifty
dollars
for
the
six
weeks
of
nursing
voila
a
draft
on
montreal
a
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
as
good
as
gold
and
beside
that
there
was
the
incalculable
debt
for
this
great
kindness
to
a
sick
man
for
which
he
would
always
be
de
la
motte
grateful
debtor
the
lawyer
face
the
scars
still
red
and
angry
lit
up
with
a
curious
mixed
light
of
shrewdness
and
gratitude
jean
was
somewhat
moved
his
castle
was
in
ruins
but
he
remained
noble
by
the
old
law
that
was
something
a
few
days
later
the
doctor
pronounced
it
safe
to
move
the
patient
he
came
with
a
carriage
to
fetch
him
jean
well
fumigated
and
dressed
in
a
new
suit
of
clothes
walked
down
the
road
beside
them
to
the
gate
there
alma
met
him
with
both
hands
his
eyes
embraced
her
the
air
of
june
was
radiant
about
them
the
fragrance
of
the
woods
breathed
itself
over
the
broad
valley
a
song
sparrow
poured
his
heart
out
from
a
blossoming
lilac
the
world
was
large
and
free
and
very
good
and
between
the
lovers
there
was
nothing
but
a
little
gate
understand
said
the
doctor
smiling
as
he
tightened
up
the
reins
understand
that
there
is
a
title
in
your
family
de
la
motte
in
effect
that
you
are
a
marquis
is
true
said
jean
turning
his
head
least
so
i
do
i
said
the
doctor
you
had
better
go
in
monsieur
le
marquis
you
keep
madame
la
marquise
viii
the
keeper
of
the
light
at
long
distance
looking
over
the
blue
waters
of
the
gulf
of
lawrence
in
clear
weather
you
might
think
that
you
saw
a
lonely
perching
motionless
on
a
cobble
of
gray
rock
then
as
your
boat
drifted
in
following
the
languid
tide
and
the
soft
southern
breeze
you
would
perceive
that
the
cobble
of
rock
was
a
rugged
hill
with
a
few
bushes
and
stunted
trees
growing
in
the
crevices
and
that
the
gleaming
speck
near
the
summit
must
be
some
kind
of
a
building
if
you
were
on
the
coast
of
italy
or
spain
you
would
say
a
villa
or
a
then
as
you
floated
still
farther
north
and
drew
nearer
to
the
coast
the
desolate
hill
would
detach
itself
from
the
mainland
and
become
a
little
with
a
flock
of
smaller
islets
clustering
around
it
as
a
brood
of
wild
ducks
keep
close
to
their
mother
and
with
deep
water
nearly
two
miles
wide
flowing
between
it
and
the
shore
while
the
shining
speck
on
the
seaward
side
stood
out
clearly
as
a
low
whitewashed
dwelling
with
a
sturdy
round
tower
at
one
end
crowned
with
a
big
lantern
a
solitary
lighthouse
that
is
the
isle
of
the
wise
virgin
behind
it
the
long
blue
laurentian
mountains
clothed
with
unbroken
forest
rise
in
sombre
ranges
toward
the
height
of
land
in
front
of
it
the
waters
of
the
gulf
heave
and
sparkle
far
away
to
where
the
dim
peaks
of
anne
des
monts
are
traced
along
the
southern
horizon
sheltered
a
little
but
not
completely
by
the
island
breakwater
of
granite
lies
the
rocky
beach
of
dead
point
where
an
english
navy
was
wrecked
in
a
night
of
storm
a
hundred
years
ago
there
are
a
score
of
wooden
houses
a
tiny
chapel
a
hudson
bay
company
store
a
row
of
platforms
for
drying
fish
and
a
varied
assortment
of
boats
and
nets
strung
along
the
beach
now
dead
men
point
has
developed
into
a
centre
of
industry
with
a
life
a
tradition
a
social
character
of
its
own
and
in
one
of
those
houses
as
you
sit
at
the
door
in
the
lingering
june
twilight
looking
out
across
the
deep
channel
to
where
the
lantern
of
the
tower
is
just
beginning
to
glow
with
orange
radiance
above
the
shadow
of
the
island
in
that
place
in
that
mystical
hour
you
should
hear
the
story
of
the
light
and
its
keeper
i
when
the
lighthouse
was
built
many
years
ago
the
island
had
another
name
it
was
called
the
isle
of
birds
thousands
of
nested
there
the
handful
of
people
who
lived
on
the
shore
robbed
the
nests
and
slaughtered
the
birds
with
considerable
profit
it
was
perceived
in
advance
that
the
building
of
the
lighthouse
would
interfere
with
this
and
with
other
things
hence
it
was
not
altogether
a
popular
improvement
marcel
thibault
the
oldest
inhabitant
was
the
leader
of
the
opposition
lighthouse
said
he
good
will
it
be
for
us
we
know
the
way
in
and
out
when
it
makes
clear
weather
by
day
or
by
night
but
when
the
sky
gets
swampy
when
it
makes
fog
then
we
stay
with
ourselves
at
home
or
we
run
into
la
trinite
or
pentecote
we
know
the
way
what
the
stranger
boats
the
stranger
boats
need
not
to
come
here
if
they
know
not
the
way
the
more
fish
the
more
seals
the
more
everything
will
there
be
left
for
us
just
because
of
the
stranger
boats
to
build
something
that
makes
all
the
birds
wild
and
spoils
the
hunting
that
is
a
fool
work
the
good
god
made
no
stupid
light
on
the
isle
of
birds
he
saw
no
necessity
of
continued
thibault
puffing
slowly
at
his
pipe
those
stranger
boats
sometimes
they
are
lost
they
come
ashore
it
is
sad
but
who
gets
the
things
that
are
saved
all
sorts
of
things
good
to
put
into
our
houses
good
to
eat
good
to
sell
sometimes
a
boat
that
can
be
patched
up
almost
like
new
who
gets
these
things
eh
doubtless
those
for
whom
the
good
god
intended
them
but
who
shall
get
them
when
this
sacre
lighthouse
is
built
eh
tell
me
that
you
baptiste
fortin
represented
the
party
of
progress
in
the
little
parliament
of
the
beach
he
had
come
down
from
quebec
some
years
ago
bringing
with
him
a
wife
and
two
little
daughters
and
a
good
many
new
notions
about
life
he
had
good
luck
at
the
and
built
a
house
with
windows
at
the
side
as
well
as
in
front
when
his
third
girl
nataline
was
born
he
went
so
far
as
to
paint
the
house
red
and
put
on
a
kitchen
and
enclose
a
bit
of
ground
for
a
yard
this
marked
him
as
a
radical
an
innovator
it
was
expected
that
he
would
defend
the
building
of
the
lighthouse
and
he
did
thibault
he
said
talk
well
but
you
talk
too
late
it
is
of
a
past
age
your
talk
a
new
time
comes
to
the
cote
nord
we
begin
to
civilize
ourselves
to
hold
back
against
the
light
would
be
our
shame
tell
me
this
marcel
thibault
what
men
are
they
that
love
darkness
growled
thibault
is
a
little
strong
you
say
my
deeds
are
evil
no
answered
fortin
say
not
that
my
friend
but
i
say
this
lighthouse
means
good
good
for
us
and
good
for
all
who
come
to
this
coast
it
will
bring
more
trade
to
us
it
will
bring
a
boat
with
the
mail
with
newspapers
perhaps
once
perhaps
twice
a
month
all
through
the
summer
it
will
bring
us
into
the
great
world
to
lose
that
for
the
sake
of
a
few
birds
ca
sera
de
valeur
besides
it
is
impossible
the
lighthouse
is
coming
fortin
was
right
of
course
but
thibault
position
was
not
altogether
unnatural
nor
unfamiliar
all
over
the
world
for
the
past
hundred
years
people
have
been
kicking
against
the
sharpness
of
the
pricks
that
drove
them
forward
out
of
the
old
life
the
wild
life
the
free
life
grown
dear
to
them
because
it
was
so
easy
there
has
been
a
terrible
interference
with
and
other
things
all
over
the
world
the
great
something
that
bridges
rivers
and
tunnels
mountains
and
fells
forests
and
populates
deserts
and
opens
up
the
hidden
corners
of
the
earth
has
been
pushing
steadily
on
and
the
people
who
like
things
to
remain
as
they
are
have
had
to
give
up
a
great
deal
there
was
no
exception
made
in
favour
of
dead
men
point
the
isle
of
birds
lay
in
the
line
of
progress
the
lighthouse
arrived
it
was
a
very
good
house
for
that
day
the
keeper
dwelling
had
three
rooms
and
was
solidly
built
the
tower
was
thirty
feet
high
the
lantern
held
a
revolving
light
with
a
fresnel
lamp
burning
sperm
oil
there
was
one
of
stevenson
new
cages
of
dioptric
prisms
around
the
flame
and
once
every
minute
it
was
turned
by
clockwork
flashing
a
broad
belt
of
radiance
fifteen
miles
across
the
sea
all
night
long
that
big
bright
eye
was
opening
and
shutting
said
thibault
winks
like
a
the
department
of
marine
and
fisheries
sent
down
an
expert
from
quebec
to
keep
the
light
in
order
and
run
it
for
the
first
summer
he
took
fortin
as
his
assistant
by
the
end
of
august
he
reported
to
headquarters
that
the
light
was
all
right
and
that
fortin
was
qualified
to
be
appointed
keeper
before
october
was
out
the
certificate
of
appointment
came
back
and
the
expert
packed
his
bag
to
go
up
the
river
look
here
fortin
said
he
is
no
fishing
trip
do
you
think
you
are
up
to
this
job
suppose
said
fortin
now
do
you
remember
all
this
business
about
the
machinery
that
turns
the
lenses
that
the
main
thing
the
bearings
must
be
kept
well
oiled
and
the
weight
must
never
get
out
of
order
the
will
tell
you
when
it
is
running
right
if
anything
gets
hitched
up
the
crank
to
keep
it
going
until
you
can
straighten
the
machine
again
it
easy
enough
to
turn
it
but
you
must
never
let
it
stop
between
dark
and
daylight
the
regular
turn
once
a
minute
that
the
mark
of
this
light
if
it
shines
steady
it
might
as
well
be
out
yes
better
any
vessel
coming
along
here
in
a
dirty
night
and
seeing
a
fixed
light
would
take
it
for
the
cap
and
run
ashore
this
particular
light
has
got
to
revolve
once
a
minute
every
night
from
april
first
to
december
tenth
certain
can
you
do
it
said
fortin
the
way
i
like
to
hear
a
man
talk
now
you
got
oil
enough
to
last
you
through
till
the
tenth
of
december
when
you
close
the
light
and
to
run
on
for
a
month
in
the
spring
after
you
open
again
the
ice
may
be
late
in
going
out
and
perhaps
the
ca
get
down
before
the
middle
of
april
or
thereabouts
but
she
bring
plenty
of
oil
when
she
comes
so
you
be
all
right
said
fortin
i
said
it
all
i
guess
you
understand
what
you
got
to
do
and
good
luck
you
the
keeper
of
the
light
luck
said
fortin
am
going
to
keep
the
same
day
he
shut
up
the
red
house
on
the
beach
and
moved
to
the
white
house
on
the
island
with
his
wife
and
the
three
girls
alma
aged
seventeen
azilda
aged
fifteen
and
nataline
aged
thirteen
he
was
the
captain
and
was
the
mate
and
the
three
girls
were
the
crew
they
were
all
as
full
of
happy
pride
as
if
they
had
come
into
possession
of
a
great
fortune
it
was
the
day
of
october
a
had
silvered
the
island
the
afternoon
was
clear
and
beautiful
as
the
sun
sloped
toward
the
hills
of
the
mainland
the
whole
family
stood
out
in
front
of
the
lighthouse
looking
up
at
the
tower
him
well
my
children
said
baptiste
has
given
him
to
us
to
keep
and
to
keep
us
thibault
says
he
is
a
windigo
we
shall
see
that
he
is
a
friendly
windigo
every
minute
all
the
night
he
shall
wink
just
for
kindness
and
good
luck
to
all
the
world
till
the
ii
on
the
ninth
of
november
at
three
in
the
afternoon
baptiste
went
into
the
tower
to
see
that
the
clockwork
was
in
order
for
the
night
he
set
the
dial
on
the
machine
put
a
few
drops
of
oil
on
the
bearings
of
the
cylinder
and
started
to
wind
up
the
weight
it
rose
a
few
inches
gave
a
dull
click
and
then
stopped
dead
he
tugged
a
little
harder
but
it
would
not
move
then
he
tried
to
let
it
down
he
pushed
at
the
lever
that
set
the
clockwork
in
motion
he
might
as
well
have
tried
to
make
the
island
turn
around
by
pushing
at
one
of
the
little
spruce
trees
that
clung
to
the
rock
then
it
dawned
fearfully
upon
him
that
something
must
be
wrong
trembling
with
anxiety
he
climbed
up
and
peered
in
among
the
wheels
the
escapement
wheel
was
cracked
clean
through
as
if
some
one
had
struck
it
with
the
head
of
an
axe
and
one
of
the
pallets
of
the
spindle
was
stuck
fast
in
the
crack
he
could
knock
it
out
easily
enough
but
when
the
crack
came
around
again
the
pallet
would
catch
and
the
clock
would
stop
once
more
it
was
a
fatal
injury
baptiste
turned
white
then
red
gripped
his
head
in
his
hands
and
ran
down
the
steps
out
of
the
door
straight
toward
his
canoe
which
was
pulled
up
on
the
western
side
of
the
island
he
cried
has
done
this
let
me
catch
him
if
that
old
thibault
as
he
leaped
down
the
rocky
slope
the
setting
sun
gleamed
straight
in
his
eyes
it
was
poised
like
a
ball
of
fire
on
the
very
edge
of
the
mountains
five
minutes
more
and
it
would
be
gone
fifteen
minutes
more
and
darkness
would
close
in
then
the
giant
eye
must
begin
to
glow
and
to
wink
precisely
once
a
minute
all
night
long
if
not
what
became
of
the
keeper
word
his
faith
his
honour
no
matter
how
the
injury
to
the
clockwork
was
done
no
matter
who
was
to
be
blamed
or
punished
for
it
that
could
wait
the
question
now
was
whether
the
light
would
fail
or
not
and
it
must
be
answered
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
that
red
ray
of
the
vanishing
sun
was
like
a
blow
in
the
face
to
baptiste
it
stopped
him
short
dazed
and
bewildered
then
he
came
to
himself
wheeled
and
ran
up
the
rocks
faster
than
he
had
come
down
alma
he
shouted
as
he
dashed
past
the
door
of
the
house
of
you
to
me
in
the
tower
he
was
up
in
the
lantern
when
they
came
running
in
full
of
curiosity
excited
asking
twenty
questions
at
once
nataline
climbed
up
the
ladder
and
put
her
head
through
the
is
it
she
panted
has
hap
down
answered
her
father
down
all
at
once
wait
for
me
i
am
coming
i
will
the
explanation
was
not
altogether
lucid
and
scientific
there
were
some
bad
words
mixed
up
with
it
baptiste
was
still
hot
with
anger
and
the
unsatisfied
desire
to
whip
somebody
he
did
not
know
whom
for
something
he
did
not
know
what
but
angry
as
he
was
he
was
still
sane
enough
to
hold
his
mind
hard
and
close
to
the
main
point
the
crank
must
be
adjusted
the
machine
must
be
ready
to
turn
before
dark
while
he
worked
he
hastily
made
the
situation
clear
to
his
listeners
that
crank
must
be
turned
by
hand
round
and
round
all
night
not
too
slow
not
too
fast
the
dial
on
the
machine
must
mark
time
with
the
clock
on
the
wall
the
light
must
flash
once
every
minute
until
daybreak
he
would
do
as
much
of
the
labour
as
he
could
but
the
wife
and
the
two
older
girls
must
help
him
nataline
could
go
to
bed
at
this
nataline
short
upper
lip
trembled
she
rubbed
her
eyes
with
the
sleeve
of
her
dress
and
began
to
weep
silently
is
the
matter
with
you
said
her
mother
child
have
you
fear
to
sleep
alone
a
big
girl
like
you
she
sobbed
have
no
fear
but
i
want
some
of
the
growled
her
father
fun
nom
chien
she
calls
this
fun
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
as
she
stood
there
half
defiant
half
despondent
with
her
red
mouth
quivering
and
her
big
brown
eyes
sparkling
fire
then
he
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
here
my
little
he
said
drawing
her
to
him
and
kissing
her
are
a
good
girl
after
all
i
suppose
you
think
this
light
is
part
yours
eh
the
girl
nodded
you
shall
have
your
share
fun
and
all
you
shall
make
the
tea
for
us
and
bring
us
something
to
eat
perhaps
when
alma
and
fatigue
themselves
they
will
permit
a
few
turns
of
the
crank
to
you
are
you
content
run
now
and
boil
the
it
was
a
very
long
night
no
matter
how
easily
a
handle
turns
after
a
certain
number
of
revolutions
there
is
a
stiffness
about
it
the
stiffness
is
not
in
the
handle
but
in
the
hand
that
pushes
it
round
and
round
evenly
steadily
minute
after
minute
hour
after
hour
shoving
out
drawing
in
circle
after
circle
no
swerving
no
stopping
no
varying
the
motion
turn
after
turn
what
the
use
of
counting
watch
the
dial
go
to
sleep
no
for
god
sake
no
sleep
but
how
hard
it
is
to
keep
awake
how
heavy
the
arm
grows
how
stiffly
the
muscles
move
how
the
will
creaks
and
groans
batiscan
it
is
not
easy
for
a
human
being
to
become
part
of
a
machine
fortin
himself
took
the
longest
spell
at
the
crank
of
course
he
went
at
his
work
with
a
rigid
courage
his
anger
had
cooled
down
into
a
shape
that
was
like
a
bar
of
forged
steel
he
meant
to
make
that
light
revolve
if
it
killed
him
to
do
it
he
was
the
captain
of
a
company
that
had
run
into
an
ambuscade
he
was
going
to
fight
his
way
through
if
he
had
to
fight
alone
the
wife
and
the
two
older
girls
followed
him
blindly
and
bravely
in
the
habit
of
sheer
obedience
they
did
not
quite
understand
the
meaning
of
the
task
the
honour
of
victory
the
shame
of
defeat
but
fortin
said
it
must
be
done
and
he
knew
best
so
they
took
their
places
in
turn
as
he
grew
weary
and
kept
the
light
flashing
and
nataline
well
there
is
no
way
of
describing
what
nataline
did
except
to
say
that
she
played
the
fife
she
felt
the
contest
just
as
her
father
did
not
as
deeply
perhaps
but
in
the
same
spirit
she
went
into
the
fight
with
darkness
like
a
little
soldier
and
she
played
the
fife
when
she
came
up
from
the
kitchen
with
the
smoking
pail
of
tea
she
rapped
on
the
door
and
called
out
to
know
whether
the
windigo
was
at
home
she
ran
in
and
out
of
the
place
like
a
squirrel
she
looked
up
at
the
light
and
laughed
then
she
ran
in
and
reported
winks
she
said
winks
beautifully
keep
him
going
my
turn
now
she
refused
to
be
put
off
with
a
shorter
spell
than
the
other
girls
she
cried
can
do
it
as
well
as
you
you
think
you
are
so
much
older
well
what
of
that
the
light
is
part
mine
father
said
so
let
me
turn
when
the
first
glimmer
of
the
little
day
came
shivering
along
the
eastern
horizon
nataline
was
at
the
crank
the
mother
and
the
two
older
girls
were
half
asleep
baptiste
stepped
out
to
look
at
the
sky
he
cried
returning
can
stop
now
it
is
growing
gray
in
the
east
almost
not
yet
said
nataline
must
wait
for
the
first
red
a
few
more
turns
let
finish
it
up
with
a
she
shook
her
head
and
piped
up
the
refrain
of
the
old
canadian
chanson
roulant
ma
roulant
en
roulant
ma
and
to
that
cheerful
music
the
first
night
battle
was
carried
through
to
victory
the
next
day
fortin
spent
two
hours
in
trying
to
repair
the
clockwork
it
was
of
no
use
the
broken
part
was
indispensable
and
could
not
be
replaced
at
noon
he
went
over
to
the
mainland
to
tell
of
the
disaster
and
perhaps
to
find
out
if
any
hostile
hand
was
responsible
for
it
he
found
out
nothing
every
one
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
accident
perhaps
there
was
a
flaw
in
the
wheel
perhaps
it
had
broken
itself
that
was
possible
fortin
could
not
deny
it
but
the
thing
that
hurt
him
most
was
that
he
got
so
little
sympathy
nobody
seemed
to
care
whether
the
light
was
kept
burning
or
not
when
he
told
them
how
the
machine
had
been
turned
all
night
by
hand
they
were
astonished
they
cried
must
have
had
a
great
misery
to
do
but
that
he
proposed
to
go
on
doing
it
for
a
month
longer
until
december
tenth
and
to
begin
again
on
april
first
and
go
on
turning
the
light
by
hand
for
three
or
four
weeks
more
until
the
came
down
and
brought
the
necessary
tools
to
repair
the
machine
such
an
idea
as
this
went
beyond
their
horizon
you
are
crazy
baptiste
they
said
can
never
do
it
you
are
not
would
be
crazy
he
answered
i
did
not
see
what
i
must
do
that
light
is
my
charge
in
all
the
world
there
is
nothing
else
so
great
as
that
for
me
and
for
my
family
you
understand
for
us
it
is
the
chief
thing
it
is
my
ten
commandments
i
shall
keep
it
or
be
there
was
a
silence
after
this
remark
they
were
not
very
particular
about
the
use
of
language
at
dead
men
point
but
this
shocked
them
a
little
they
thought
that
fortin
was
swearing
a
shade
too
hard
in
reality
he
was
never
more
reverent
never
more
soberly
in
earnest
after
a
while
he
continued
want
some
one
to
help
me
with
the
work
on
the
island
we
must
be
up
all
the
nights
now
by
day
we
must
get
some
sleep
i
want
another
man
or
a
strong
boy
is
there
any
who
will
come
the
government
will
pay
or
if
not
i
will
pay
there
was
no
response
all
the
men
hung
back
the
lighthouse
was
still
unpopular
or
at
least
it
was
on
trial
fortin
pluck
and
resolution
had
undoubtedly
impressed
them
a
little
but
they
still
hesitated
to
commit
themselves
to
his
side
he
said
is
no
one
then
we
shall
manage
the
affair
en
famille
bon
soir
messieurs
he
walked
down
to
the
beach
with
his
head
in
the
air
without
looking
back
but
before
he
had
his
canoe
in
the
water
he
heard
some
one
running
down
behind
him
it
was
thibault
youngest
son
marcel
a
boy
of
sixteen
very
much
out
of
breath
with
running
and
shyness
fortin
he
stammered
you
do
you
think
am
i
big
enough
baptiste
looked
him
in
the
face
for
a
moment
then
his
eyes
twinkled
he
answered
are
bigger
than
your
father
but
what
will
he
say
to
this
says
blurted
out
marcel
he
says
that
he
will
say
nothing
if
i
do
not
ask
so
the
little
marcel
was
enlisted
in
the
crew
on
the
island
for
thirty
nights
those
six
people
a
man
and
a
boy
and
four
women
nataline
was
not
going
to
submit
to
any
distinctions
on
the
score
of
age
you
may
be
sure
for
a
full
month
they
turned
their
flashing
lantern
by
hand
from
dusk
to
the
fog
the
frost
the
hail
the
snow
beleaguered
their
tower
hunger
and
cold
sleeplessness
and
weariness
pain
and
discouragement
held
rendezvous
in
that
dismal
cramped
little
room
many
a
night
fife
of
fun
played
a
feeble
wheezy
note
but
it
played
and
the
crank
went
round
and
every
bit
of
glass
in
the
lantern
was
as
clear
as
polished
crystal
and
the
big
lamp
was
full
of
oil
and
the
great
eye
of
the
friendly
giant
winked
without
ceasing
through
fierce
storm
and
placid
moonlight
when
the
tenth
of
december
came
the
light
went
to
sleep
for
the
winter
and
the
keepers
took
their
way
across
the
ice
to
the
mainland
they
had
won
the
battle
not
only
on
the
island
fighting
against
the
elements
but
also
at
dead
men
point
against
public
opinion
the
inhabitants
began
to
understand
that
the
lighthouse
meant
something
a
law
an
order
a
principle
men
can
not
help
feeling
respect
for
a
thing
when
they
see
others
willing
to
fight
or
to
suffer
for
it
when
the
time
arrived
to
kindle
the
light
again
in
the
spring
fortin
could
have
had
any
one
that
he
wanted
to
help
him
but
no
he
chose
the
little
marcel
again
the
boy
wanted
to
go
and
he
had
earned
the
right
besides
he
and
nataline
had
struck
up
a
close
friendship
on
the
island
cemented
during
the
winter
by
various
hunting
excursions
after
hares
and
ptarmigan
marcel
was
a
skilful
setter
of
snares
but
nataline
was
not
content
until
she
had
won
consent
to
borrow
her
father
carabine
they
hunted
in
partnership
one
day
they
had
shot
a
fox
that
is
nataline
had
shot
it
though
marcel
had
seen
it
first
and
tracked
it
now
they
wanted
to
try
for
a
seal
on
the
point
of
the
island
when
the
ice
went
out
it
was
quite
essential
that
marcel
should
go
said
baptiste
to
his
wife
confidentially
boy
costs
less
than
a
man
why
should
we
waste
money
marcel
is
a
is
seldom
averse
to
economy
in
small
things
like
money
but
there
was
not
much
play
in
the
spring
session
with
the
light
on
the
island
it
was
a
bitter
job
december
had
been
compared
with
april
first
the
southeast
wind
kept
the
ice
driving
in
along
the
shore
then
the
northwest
wind
came
hurtling
down
from
the
arctic
wilderness
like
a
pack
of
wolves
there
was
a
of
four
days
and
nights
that
made
the
whole
world
earth
and
sky
and
sea
look
like
a
crazy
white
chaos
and
through
it
all
that
weary
dogged
crank
must
be
kept
turning
turning
from
dark
to
daylight
it
seemed
as
if
the
would
never
come
at
last
they
saw
it
one
fair
afternoon
april
the
creeping
slowly
down
the
coast
they
were
just
getting
ready
for
another
night
work
fortin
ran
out
of
the
tower
took
off
his
hat
and
began
to
say
his
prayers
the
wife
and
the
two
elder
girls
stood
in
the
kitchen
door
crossing
themselves
with
tears
in
their
eyes
marcel
and
nataline
were
coming
up
from
the
point
of
the
island
where
they
had
been
watching
for
their
seal
she
was
singing
pere
fille
que
moi
encore
sur
la
mer
il
when
she
saw
the
boat
she
stopped
short
for
a
minute
she
said
find
us
awake
and
if
they
come
faster
than
that
we
have
another
chance
to
show
them
how
we
make
the
light
wink
eh
then
she
went
on
with
her
song
mignonne
cecilia
ah
ah
ah
ah
cecilia
iii
you
did
not
suppose
that
was
the
end
of
the
story
did
you
no
an
story
does
not
end
like
that
broken
off
in
the
middle
with
a
bit
of
a
song
it
goes
on
to
something
definite
like
a
wedding
or
a
funeral
you
have
not
heard
yet
how
near
the
light
came
to
failing
and
how
the
keeper
saved
it
and
something
else
too
nataline
story
is
not
told
it
is
only
begun
this
first
part
is
only
the
introduction
just
to
let
you
see
what
kind
of
a
girl
she
was
and
how
her
life
was
made
if
you
want
to
hear
the
conclusion
we
must
hurry
along
a
little
faster
or
we
shall
never
get
to
it
nataline
grew
up
like
a
young
birch
tree
stately
and
strong
good
to
look
at
she
was
beautiful
in
her
place
she
fitted
it
exactly
her
bronzed
face
with
an
of
red
her
low
black
eyebrows
her
clear
eyes
like
the
brown
waters
of
a
woodland
stream
her
dark
curly
hair
with
little
tendrils
always
blowing
loose
around
the
pillar
of
her
neck
her
broad
breast
and
sloping
shoulders
her
firm
fearless
step
her
voice
rich
and
vibrant
her
straight
steady
looks
but
there
who
can
describe
a
thing
like
that
i
tell
you
she
was
a
girl
to
love
there
was
nothing
that
she
could
not
do
she
could
cook
she
could
swing
an
axe
she
could
paddle
a
canoe
she
could
fish
she
could
shoot
and
best
of
all
she
could
run
the
lighthouse
her
father
devotion
to
it
had
gone
into
her
blood
it
was
the
centre
of
her
life
her
law
of
god
there
was
nothing
about
it
that
she
did
not
understand
and
love
from
the
first
of
april
to
the
tenth
of
december
the
flashing
of
that
light
was
like
the
beating
of
her
heart
steady
even
unfaltering
she
kept
time
to
it
as
unconsciously
as
the
tides
follow
the
moon
she
lived
by
it
and
for
it
there
were
no
more
accidents
to
the
clockwork
after
the
first
one
was
repaired
it
ran
on
regularly
year
after
year
alma
and
azilda
were
married
and
went
away
to
live
one
on
the
south
shore
the
other
at
quebec
nataline
was
her
father
man
as
the
rheumatism
took
hold
of
him
and
lamed
his
shoulders
and
wrists
more
and
more
of
the
work
fell
upon
her
she
was
proud
of
it
at
last
it
came
to
pass
one
day
in
january
that
baptiste
died
he
was
not
gathered
to
his
fathers
for
they
were
buried
far
away
beside
the
montmorenci
and
on
the
rocky
coast
of
brittany
but
the
men
dug
through
the
snow
behind
the
tiny
chapel
at
dead
men
point
and
made
a
grave
for
baptiste
fortin
and
the
young
priest
of
the
mission
read
the
funeral
service
over
it
it
went
without
saying
that
nataline
was
to
be
the
keeper
of
the
light
at
least
until
the
came
down
again
in
the
spring
and
orders
arrived
from
the
government
in
quebec
why
not
she
was
a
woman
it
is
true
but
if
a
woman
can
do
a
thing
as
well
as
a
man
why
should
she
not
do
it
besides
nataline
could
do
this
particular
thing
much
better
than
any
man
on
the
point
everybody
approved
of
her
as
the
heir
of
her
father
especially
young
marcel
thibault
what
yes
of
course
you
could
not
help
guessing
it
he
was
nataline
lover
they
were
to
be
married
the
next
summer
they
sat
together
in
the
best
room
while
the
old
mother
was
rocking
to
and
fro
and
knitting
beside
the
kitchen
stove
and
talked
of
what
they
were
going
to
do
once
in
a
while
when
nataline
grieved
for
her
father
she
would
let
marcel
put
his
arm
around
her
and
comfort
her
in
the
way
that
lovers
know
but
their
talk
was
mainly
of
the
future
because
they
were
young
and
of
the
light
because
nataline
life
belonged
to
it
perhaps
the
government
would
remember
that
year
when
it
was
kept
going
by
hand
for
two
months
and
give
it
to
her
to
keep
as
long
as
she
lived
that
would
be
only
fair
certainly
it
was
hers
for
the
present
no
one
had
as
good
a
right
to
it
she
took
possession
without
a
doubt
at
all
events
while
she
was
the
keeper
the
light
should
not
fail
but
that
winter
was
a
bad
one
on
the
north
shore
and
particularly
at
dead
men
point
it
was
terribly
bad
the
summer
before
the
fishing
had
been
almost
a
dead
failure
in
june
a
wild
storm
had
smashed
all
the
salmon
nets
and
swept
most
of
them
away
in
july
they
could
find
no
caplin
for
bait
for
the
and
in
august
and
september
they
could
find
no
cod
the
few
bushels
of
potatoes
that
some
of
the
inhabitants
had
planted
rotted
in
the
ground
the
people
at
the
point
went
into
the
winter
short
of
money
and
very
short
of
food
there
were
some
supplies
at
the
store
pork
and
flour
and
molasses
and
they
could
run
through
the
year
on
credit
and
pay
their
debts
the
following
summer
if
the
fish
came
back
but
this
resource
also
failed
them
in
the
last
week
of
january
the
store
caught
fire
and
burned
up
nothing
was
saved
the
only
hope
now
was
the
in
february
and
march
and
april
that
at
least
would
bring
them
meat
and
oil
enough
to
keep
them
from
starvation
but
this
hope
failed
too
the
winds
blew
strong
from
the
north
and
west
driving
the
ice
far
out
into
the
gulf
the
chase
was
long
and
perilous
the
seals
were
few
and
wild
less
than
a
dozen
were
killed
in
all
by
the
last
week
in
march
dead
men
point
stood
face
to
face
with
famine
then
it
was
that
old
thibault
had
an
idea
is
sperm
oil
on
the
island
of
birds
said
he
the
lighthouse
plenty
of
it
gallons
of
it
it
is
not
very
good
to
taste
perhaps
but
what
of
that
it
will
keep
life
in
the
body
the
esquimaux
drink
it
in
the
north
often
we
must
take
the
oil
of
the
lighthouse
to
keep
us
from
starving
until
the
comes
how
shall
we
get
it
asked
the
others
is
locked
up
nataline
fortin
has
the
key
will
she
give
it
it
growled
thibault
of
a
name
of
course
she
will
give
it
she
must
is
not
a
life
the
life
of
all
of
us
more
than
a
light
a
committee
of
three
with
thibault
at
the
head
waited
upon
nataline
without
delay
told
her
their
plan
and
asked
for
the
key
she
thought
it
over
silently
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
refused
she
said
will
not
give
the
key
that
oil
is
for
the
lamp
if
you
take
it
the
lamp
will
not
be
lighted
on
the
first
of
april
it
will
not
be
burning
when
the
comes
for
me
that
would
be
shame
disgrace
worse
than
death
i
am
the
keeper
of
the
light
you
shall
not
have
the
they
argued
with
her
pleaded
with
her
tried
to
browbeat
her
she
was
a
rock
her
round
was
set
like
a
steel
trap
her
lips
straightened
into
a
white
line
her
eyebrows
drew
together
and
her
eyes
grew
black
she
cried
tell
you
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
all
in
this
house
i
will
share
with
you
but
not
one
drop
of
what
belongs
to
the
light
later
in
the
afternoon
the
priest
came
to
see
her
a
thin
pale
young
man
bent
with
the
hardships
of
his
life
and
with
sad
dreams
in
his
sunken
eyes
he
talked
with
her
very
gently
and
kindly
well
my
daughter
think
seriously
what
you
do
is
it
not
our
first
duty
to
save
human
life
surely
that
must
be
according
to
the
will
of
god
will
you
refuse
to
obey
it
nataline
was
trembling
a
little
now
her
brows
were
unlocked
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
and
ran
down
her
cheeks
she
was
twisting
her
hands
together
father
she
answered
desire
to
do
the
will
of
god
but
how
shall
i
know
it
is
it
not
his
first
command
that
we
should
love
and
serve
him
faithfully
in
the
duty
which
he
has
given
us
he
gave
me
this
light
to
keep
my
father
kept
it
he
is
dead
if
i
am
unfaithful
what
will
he
say
to
me
besides
the
is
coming
soon
i
have
thought
of
this
when
it
comes
it
will
bring
food
but
if
the
light
is
out
the
boat
may
be
lost
that
would
be
the
punishment
for
my
sin
no
mon
pere
we
must
trust
god
he
will
keep
the
people
i
will
keep
the
the
priest
looked
at
her
long
and
steadily
a
glow
came
into
his
face
he
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
shall
follow
your
conscience
he
said
quietly
be
with
you
that
evening
just
at
dark
marcel
came
she
let
him
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
she
felt
like
a
little
child
tired
and
weak
he
whispered
have
done
bravely
sweetheart
you
were
right
not
to
give
the
key
that
would
have
been
a
shame
to
you
but
it
is
all
settled
now
they
will
have
the
oil
without
your
fault
they
are
going
out
to
the
lighthouse
to
break
in
and
take
what
they
want
you
need
not
know
there
will
be
no
blame
she
straightened
in
his
arms
as
if
an
electric
shock
had
passed
through
her
she
sprang
back
blazing
with
anger
she
cried
a
thief
by
with
my
hand
behind
my
back
and
my
eyes
shut
never
do
you
think
i
care
only
for
the
blame
i
tell
you
that
is
nothing
my
light
shall
not
be
robbed
never
never
she
came
close
to
him
and
took
him
by
the
shoulders
their
eyes
were
on
a
level
he
was
a
strong
man
but
she
was
the
stronger
then
thibault
she
said
you
love
me
faith
he
gasped
do
you
know
i
listen
she
continued
is
what
you
are
going
to
do
you
are
going
down
to
the
shore
at
once
to
make
ready
the
big
canoe
i
am
going
to
get
food
enough
to
last
us
for
the
month
it
will
be
a
hard
pinch
but
it
will
do
then
we
are
going
out
to
the
island
in
less
than
an
hour
day
after
is
the
first
of
april
then
we
shall
light
the
lantern
and
it
shall
burn
every
night
until
the
boat
comes
down
you
hear
now
go
and
be
quick
and
bring
your
iv
they
pushed
off
in
the
black
darkness
among
the
fragments
of
ice
that
lay
along
the
shore
they
crossed
the
strait
in
silence
and
hid
their
canoe
among
the
rocks
on
the
island
they
carried
their
stuff
up
to
the
house
and
locked
it
in
the
kitchen
then
they
unlocked
the
tower
and
went
in
marcel
with
his
and
nataline
with
her
father
old
carabine
they
fastened
the
door
again
and
bolted
it
and
sat
down
in
the
dark
to
wait
presently
they
heard
the
grating
of
the
prow
of
the
barge
on
the
stones
below
the
steps
of
men
stumbling
up
the
steep
path
and
voices
mingled
in
confused
talk
the
glimmer
of
a
couple
of
lanterns
went
bobbing
in
and
out
among
the
rocks
and
bushes
there
was
a
little
crowd
of
eight
or
ten
men
and
they
came
on
carelessly
chattering
and
laughing
three
of
them
carried
axes
and
three
others
a
heavy
log
of
wood
which
they
had
picked
up
on
their
way
log
is
better
than
the
axes
said
one
it
in
your
hands
this
way
two
of
you
on
one
side
another
on
the
opposite
side
in
the
middle
then
swing
it
back
and
forwards
and
let
it
go
the
door
will
come
down
i
tell
you
like
a
sheet
of
paper
but
wait
till
i
give
the
word
then
swing
hard
one
two
cried
nataline
throwing
open
the
little
window
you
dare
to
touch
that
door
i
she
thrust
out
the
barrel
of
the
rifle
and
marcel
appeared
beside
it
the
old
rifle
was
not
loaded
but
who
knew
that
besides
both
barrels
of
the
were
full
there
was
amazement
in
the
crowd
outside
the
tower
and
consternation
and
then
anger
they
shouted
there
maudit
polisson
come
out
of
that
let
us
in
you
told

answered
marcel
i
was
mistaken
that

man
tries
to

the
gang
muttered
cursed
threatened
looked
at
the
guns
and
went
off
to
their
boat

you
will
do
one
of
them
called
out

a
murderess

mademoiselle

people
to
die
of
hunger
i
she
answered
is
as
the
good
god
pleases
no
matter
the
light
shall
they
heard
the
babble
of
the
men
as
they
stumbled
down
the
hill
the
grinding
of
the
boat
on
the
rocks
as
they
shoved
off
the
rattle
of
the
oars
in
the
rowlocks
after
that
the
island
was
as
still
as
a
graveyard
then
nataline
sat
down
on
the
floor
in
the
dark
and
put
her
face
in
her
hands
and
cried
marcel
tried
to
comfort
her
she
took
his
hand
and
pushed
it
gently
away
from
her
waist
marcel
she
said
now
not
that
please
marcel
come
into
the
house
i
want
to
talk
with
they
went
into
the
cold
dark
kitchen
lit
a
candle
and
kindled
a
fire
in
the
stove
nataline
busied
herself
with
a
score
of
things
she
put
away
the
poor
little
store
of
provisions
sent
marcel
for
a
pail
of
water
made
some
tea
spread
the
table
and
sat
down
opposite
to
him
for
a
time
she
kept
her
eyes
turned
away
from
him
while
she
talked
about
all
sorts
of
things
then
she
fell
silent
for
a
little
still
not
looking
at
him
she
got
up
and
moved
about
the
room
arranged
two
or
three
packages
on
the
shelves
shut
the
damper
of
the
stove
glancing
at
marcel
back
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
then
she
came
back
to
her
chair
pushed
her
cup
aside
rested
both
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
looked
marcel
square
in
the
face
with
her
clear
brown
eyes
friend
she
said
you
an
honest
man
un
brave
garcon
for
an
instant
he
could
say
nothing
he
was
so
puzzled
yes
nataline
he
answered
surely
i
let
me
speak
to
you
without
fear
she
continued
do
not
suppose
that
i
am
ignorant
of
what
i
have
done
this
night
i
am
not
a
baby
you
are
a
man
i
am
a
girl
we
are
shut
up
alone
in
this
house
for
two
weeks
a
month
god
knows
how
long
you
know
what
that
means
what
people
will
say
i
have
risked
all
that
a
girl
has
most
precious
i
have
put
my
good
name
in
your
marcel
tried
to
speak
but
she
stopped
him
me
finish
it
is
not
easy
to
say
i
know
you
are
honourable
i
trust
you
waking
and
sleeping
but
i
am
a
woman
there
must
be
no
we
have
other
work
to
do
the
light
must
not
fail
you
will
not
touch
me
you
will
not
embrace
me
not
once
till
after
the
boat
has
come
she
smiled
at
him
like
a
sunburned
angel
is
it
a
bargain
she
put
out
one
hand
across
the
table
marcel
took
it
in
both
of
his
own
he
did
not
kiss
it
he
lifted
it
up
in
front
of
his
face
swear
to
you
nataline
you
shall
be
to
me
as
the
blessed
virgin
the
next
day
they
put
the
light
in
order
and
the
following
night
they
kindled
it
they
still
feared
another
attack
from
the
mainland
and
thought
it
needful
that
one
of
them
should
be
on
guard
all
the
time
though
the
machine
itself
was
working
beautifully
and
needed
little
watching
nataline
took
the
night
duty
it
was
her
own
choice
she
loved
the
charge
of
the
lamp
marcel
was
on
duty
through
the
day
they
were
together
for
three
or
four
hours
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
it
was
not
a
desperate
vigil
like
that
affair
with
the
broken
clockwork
eight
years
before
there
was
no
weary
turning
of
the
crank
there
was
just
enough
work
to
do
about
the
house
and
the
tower
to
keep
them
busy
the
weather
was
fair
the
worst
thing
was
the
short
supply
of
food
but
though
they
were
hungry
they
were
not
starving
and
nataline
still
played
the
fife
she
jested
she
sang
she
told
long
fairy
stories
while
they
sat
in
the
kitchen
marcel
admitted
that
it
was
not
at
all
a
bad
arrangement
but
his
thoughts
turned
very
often
to
the
arrival
of
the
he
hoped
it
would
not
be
late
the
ice
was
well
broken
up
already
and
driven
far
out
into
the
gulf
the
boat
ought
to
be
able
to
run
down
the
shore
in
good
time
one
evening
as
nataline
came
down
from
her
sleep
she
saw
marcel
coming
up
the
rocks
dragging
a
young
seal
behind
him
he
shouted
is
plenty
of
meat
i
shot
it
out
at
the
end
of
the
island
about
an
hour
but
nataline
said
that
they
did
not
need
the
seal
there
was
still
food
enough
in
the
larder
on
shore
there
must
be
greater
need
marcel
must
take
the
seal
over
to
the
mainland
that
night
and
leave
it
on
the
beach
near
the
priest
house
he
grumbled
a
little
but
he
did
it
that
was
on
the
of
april
the
clear
sky
held
for
three
days
longer
calm
bright
halcyon
weather
on
the
afternoon
of
the
the
clouds
came
down
from
the
north
not
a
long
furious
tempest
but
a
brief
sharp
storm
with
considerable
wind
and
a
whirling
blinding
fall
of
april
snow
it
was
a
bad
night
for
boats
at
sea
confusing
bewildering
a
night
when
the
lighthouse
had
to
do
its
best
nataline
was
in
the
tower
all
night
tending
the
lamp
watching
the
clockwork
once
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
lantern
was
so
covered
with
snow
that
light
could
not
shine
through
she
got
her
long
brush
and
scraped
the
snow
away
it
was
cold
work
but
she
gloried
in
it
the
bright
eye
of
the
tower
winking
winking
steadily
through
the
storm
seemed
to
be
the
sign
of
her
power
in
the
world
it
was
hers
she
kept
it
shining
when
morning
came
the
wind
was
still
blowing
fitfully
off
shore
but
the
snow
had
almost
ceased
nataline
stopped
the
clockwork
and
was
just
climbing
up
into
the
lantern
to
put
out
the
lamp
when
marcel
voice
hailed
her
down
nataline
come
down
quick
make
haste
she
turned
and
hurried
out
not
knowing
what
was
to
come
perhaps
a
message
of
trouble
from
the
mainland
perhaps
a
new
assault
on
the
lighthouse
as
she
came
out
of
the
tower
her
brown
eyes
heavy
from
the
her
dark
face
pale
from
the
cold
she
saw
marcel
standing
on
the
rocky
knoll
beside
the
house
and
pointing
shoreward
she
ran
up
beside
him
and
looked
there
in
the
deep
water
between
the
island
and
the
point
lay
the
rocking
quietly
on
the
waves
it
flashed
upon
her
in
a
moment
what
it
meant
the
end
of
her
fight
relief
for
the
village
victory
and
the
light
that
had
guided
the
little
ship
safe
through
the
stormy
night
into
the
harbour
was
hers
she
turned
and
looked
up
at
the
lamp
still
burning
kept
you
she
cried
then
she
turned
to
marcel
the
colour
rose
quickly
in
her
cheeks
the
light
sparkled
in
her
eyes
she
smiled
and
held
out
both
her
hands
whispering
you
shall
keep
me
there
was
a
fine
wedding
on
the
last
day
of
april
and
from
that
time
the
island
took
its
new
name
the
isle
of
the
wise
virgin
