foreword
it
seems
not
only
proper
but
necessary
that
i
should
explain
how
the
material
for
this
story
was
obtained
and
why
it
happens
that
i
can
thus
set
down
exactly
what
noel
campbell
thought
and
did
during
certain
times
while
he
was
serving
the
patriot
cause
in
the
mohawk
valley
as
few
other
boys
could
have
done
at
some
time
in
noel
life
most
likely
after
he
was
grown
to
be
a
man
with
children
and
perhaps
grandchildren
of
his
own
he
wrote
many
letters
to
relatives
of
his
in
portsmouth
new
hampshire
wherein
he
told
with
considerable
of
detail
that
which
he
did
during
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
more
particularly
while
he
and
his
friends
were
fighting
against
that
wily
indian
sachem
thayendanega
these
letters
together
with
many
others
concerning
the
struggles
of
our
people
for
independence
came
into
my
keeping
a
long
while
ago
and
from
the
lines
written
by
noel
campbell
i
have
put
together
the
following
story
after
much
the
same
fashion
as
he
himself
set
it
down
when
the
work
was
begun
i
doubted
if
thayendanega
could
have
been
frightened
by
a
party
of
boys
who
were
playing
at
being
soldiers
and
refused
to
make
such
statement
until
quite
by
chance
i
found
the
following
in
lossing
of
the
revolution
it
was
a
sunny
morning
toward
the
close
of
may
when
brant
and
his
warriors
cautiously
moved
up
to
the
brow
of
the
lofty
hill
on
the
east
side
of
the
town
cherry
valley
to
reconnoitre
the
settlement
at
their
feet
he
was
astonished
and
chagrined
on
seeing
a
fortification
where
he
supposed
all
was
weak
and
defenceless
and
greater
was
his
disappointment
when
quite
a
large
and
garrison
appeared
upon
the
esplanade
in
front
of
colonel
campbell
house
these
soldiers
were
not
as
formidable
as
the
sachem
supposed
for
they
were
only
boys
who
full
of
the
martial
spirit
of
the
times
had
formed
themselves
into
companies
and
armed
with
wooden
guns
and
swords
held
regular
drills
each
day
he
mistook
the
boys
for
soldiers
and
considering
an
attack
dangerous
moved
his
party
to
a
in
a
deep
ravine
north
of
the
village
then
again
i
questioned
if
general
herkimer
would
have
sent
two
boys
as
messengers
even
though
an
old
and
experienced
soldier
went
with
them
when
he
must
have
had
under
his
command
many
men
grown
who
were
thoroughly
familiar
with
indian
warfare
as
if
to
combat
this
doubt
i
found
the
following
statement
by
one
who
has
written
much
concerning
the
struggles
of
the
colonists
for
freedom
as
soon
as
leger
approach
up
oneida
lake
was
known
to
general
herkimer
he
summoned
the
militia
of
tryon
county
to
the
succor
of
the
garrison
at
fort
schuyler
they
rendezvoused
at
fort
dayton
on
the
german
flats
and
on
the
day
when
the
indians
encircled
the
fort
herkimer
was
near
oriskany
with
more
than
eight
hundred
men
eager
to
face
the
enemy
he
sent
as
messengers
to
gansevoort
two
boys
and
a
man
informing
him
of
his
approach
and
requesting
him
to
apprise
him
of
the
arrival
of
the
couriers
by
discharging
three
guns
in
rapid
succession
which
he
knew
would
be
heard
at
oriskany
having
thus
proven
at
least
to
my
own
satisfaction
that
so
much
of
noel
story
was
true
i
set
about
verifying
the
other
portions
and
in
no
single
instance
did
i
find
that
he
had
drawn
upon
his
imagination
therefore
i
resolved
to
write
it
down
as
the
lad
himself
would
have
spoken
being
able
because
of
the
letters
to
put
myself
very
nearly
in
his
place
i
would
it
had
been
possible
to
say
more
concerning
thayendanega
and
sir
john
johnson
for
they
played
important
parts
in
the
making
of
mohawk
valley
history
but
noel
own
account
was
of
such
length
that
i
did
not
feel
warranted
in
adding
to
it
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief
the
tale
of
the
minute
boys
of
the
mohawk
valley
is
no
more
than
a
narration
of
facts
as
can
be
verified
by
reference
to
any
of
our
standard
histories
of
the
beginnings
of
this
nation
if
the
reader
can
find
in
the
reading
the
pleasure
i
have
had
in
interpreting
noel
campbell
odd
speech
and
smoothing
down
his
too
vigorous
language
then
will
he
be
richly
repaid
for
the
perusal

around

amid
the

upon

keep
unless
you
achin
to
have
a
bullet
through
the
back
chapter
i
young
soldiers
it
sounds
like
an
unreasonable
tale
or
something
after
the
style
of
a
to
say
that
a
party
of
lads
drilling
with
wooden
guns
were
able
without
being
conscious
of
the
fact
to
frighten
from
his
bloody
work
such
a
murderous
powerful
sachem
as
thayendanega
or
joseph
brant
to
use
his
english
name
but
such
is
the
undisputed
fact
it
was
the
month
of
may
in
the
year
of
our
lord
when
we
of
cherry
valley
in
the
province
of
new
york
learned
that
this
same
thayendanega
a
mohawk
indian
whose
father
was
chief
of
the
onondaga
nation
had
come
into
the
mohawk
valley
from
canada
with
a
large
force
of
indians
who
under
the
wicked
tutoring
of
sir
john
johnson
were
ripe
for
mischief
samuel
campbell
my
uncle
was
one
of
the
leading
patriots
in
that
section
of
the
province
and
it
was
well
known
that
the
johnsons
sir
john
and
guy
the
butlers
daniel
claus
and
in
fact
all
the
tories
nearabout
would
direct
that
the
first
blow
be
struck
at
cherry
valley
in
order
that
my
uncle
might
be
killed
or
made
prisoner
therefore
at
the
time
when
we
lads
frightened
joseph
brant
without
our
own
knowledge
we
were
in
daily
fear
of
being
set
upon
by
our
enemies
among
the
boys
of
the
settlement
i
noel
campbell
was
looked
upon
as
a
leader
simply
because
my
uncle
was
the
most
influential
whig
in
the
vicinity
and
my
particular
friend
and
comrade
was
jacob
sitz
son
of
peter
a
lad
who
could
easily
best
us
all
in
trials
of
strength
or
of
woodcraft
we
had
heard
of
the
minute
men
of
lexington
and
of
the
green
mountains
and
when
the
day
came
that
all
the
men
of
our
valley
banded
themselves
together
for
the
protection
of
their
homes
against
our
neighbors
the
tories
who
thirsted
for
patriot
blood
we
lads
decided
that
we
were
old
enough
to
do
our
share
in
whatsoever
might
be
afoot
therefore
it
was
that
two
score
of
us
formed
a
league
to
help
defend
the
settlements
and
gave
ourselves
the
name
of
minute
boys
of
the
mohawk
valley
there
was
then
living
in
cherry
valley
an
old
prussian
soldier
by
name
cornelius
braun
who
in
his
native
land
had
won
the
rank
of
sergeant
but
having
grown
too
old
for
very
active
military
duty
came
to
this
country
with
the
idea
of
making
a
home
for
himself
sergeant
corney
as
nearly
every
one
called
him
was
not
so
old
however
but
that
he
could
strike
a
blow
and
a
heavy
one
in
his
own
defence
and
when
he
learned
what
we
lads
proposed
to
do
he
offered
to
drill
us
in
the
manual
of
arms
we
were
not
overly
well
equipped
in
the
way
of
weapons
although
it
is
safe
to
say
that
each
of
us
had
a
firearm
of
some
sort
but
it
seemed
to
give
sergeant
corney
the
fidgets
to
see
us
carrying
such
a
motley
collection
of
guns
and
he
insisted
on
making
a
quantity
of
wooden
muskets
to
be
used
in
the
drill
to
the
end
that
we
might
present
a
more
soldierly
appearance
when
lined
up
before
him
therefore
it
was
that
when
we
came
each
day
on
the
green
in
front
of
my
uncle
house
to
go
through
such
manoeuvres
as
our
instructor
thought
necessary
we
had
in
our
hands
only
those
harmless
wooden
guns
i
was
the
captain
of
the
company
jacob
sitz
acted
as
lieutenant
and
all
the
others
were
privates
sergeant
corney
as
a
matter
of
course
was
the
on
a
certain
day
during
the
last
week
in
may
the
exact
date
i
have
forgotten
we
were
drilling
as
usual
with
sergeant
corney
finding
more
fault
than
ever
when
we
frightened
the
famous
thayendanega
away
from
an
attack
on
the
settlement
although
as
i
have
said
we
knew
nothing
about
it
until
many
months
afterward
it
seems
as
we
learned
later
that
the
villainous
brant
had
made
all
his
plans
for
an
attack
upon
cherry
valley
and
had
secretly
gained
a
position
on
the
hill
to
the
eastward
of
the
place
counting
on
waiting
there
until
nightfall
when
he
might
surprise
us
but
much
to
his
astonishment
he
saw
what
appeared
from
the
distance
to
be
a
large
body
of
soldiers
evidently
making
ready
for
serious
work
the
scoundrelly
redskin
was
not
so
brave
that
he
was
willing
to
make
an
attack
where
it
seemed
that
the
whigs
were
prepared
to
receive
him
and
like
the
cur
that
he
was
he
marched
his
force
to
a
in
a
deep
ravine
north
of
the
settlement
near
the
road
leading
to
the
mohawk
river
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
where
we
were
drilling
now
hardly
more
than
an
hour
before
it
is
probable
that
the
indians
got
their
first
glimpse
of
us
minute
boys
lieutenant
wormwood
had
arrived
from
fort
plain
with
information
to
my
uncle
that
a
force
of
patriot
soldiers
was
on
the
way
to
check
sir
john
plans
for
killing
all
who
did
not
quite
agree
with
him
in
politics
and
to
request
that
arrangements
be
made
to
care
for
the
men
during
such
time
as
they
might
remain
in
that
vicinity
when
late
in
the
afternoon
the
lieutenant
was
ready
to
return
to
fort
plain
jacob
father
peter
sitz
was
ordered
to
accompany
him
as
bearer
of
a
message
from
my
uncle
to
the
leader
of
the
patriot
force
and
the
two
men
set
off
on
horseback
we
lads
envying
them
because
it
seemed
a
fine
thing
to
ride
to
and
fro
over
the
country
summoning
this
man
or
that
to
his
duty
it
was
the
last
time
jacob
saw
his
father
until
after
many
days
had
passed
and
what
happened
to
the
two
horsemen
we
could
only
guess
when
the
lieutenant
lifeless
body
was
found
next
day
but
we
learned
the
particulars
later
it
seems
that
when
the
messengers
arrived
near
brant
being
forced
to
pass
by
where
the
indians
were
concealed
in
order
to
get
to
fort
plain
they
were
hailed
by
some
one
in
the
thicket
but
instead
of
replying
the
men
put
spurs
to
their
horses
the
savages
in
ambush
fired
a
volley
lieutenant
wormwood
was
killed
instantly
while
jacob
father
was
so
seriously
wounded
that
he
fell
from
his
horse
and
a
few
seconds
later
found
himself
a
prisoner
among
brant
wolves
when
the
tidings
of
this
tragedy
was
brought
into
the
settlement
jacob
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
as
might
have
been
expected
and
even
my
uncle
had
great
difficulty
in
preventing
the
distressed
lad
from
rushing
into
the
wilderness
with
the
poor
hope
that
he
might
be
able
to
effect
his
father
rescue
he
was
only
sixteen
years
of
age
two
months
older
than
i
but
within
an
hour
after
we
knew
beyond
a
peradventure
that
peter
sitz
was
a
prisoner
it
seemed
as
if
the
lad
had
grown
to
be
a
man
it
was
this
first
blow
against
the
settlement
of
cherry
valley
by
the
murderous
brant
which
brought
us
minute
boys
of
the
mohawk
valley
into
active
service
for
from
that
day
we
saw
as
much
of
warfare
as
did
our
elders
and
i
am
proud
to
be
able
to
set
down
the
fact
that
we
performed
good
work
although
we
failed
as
did
the
men
of
the
settlement
in
preventing
it
from
being
destroyed
a
year
and
a
half
later
while
the
fighting
force
of
the
population
was
absent
the
murder
of
lieutenant
wormwood
was
sufficient
evidence
that
the
tories
and
their
savage
allies
were
prepared
to
harry
us
and
within
a
very
few
minutes
after
the
body
of
the
officer
had
been
brought
in
the
men
made
ready
to
defend
their
homes
a
council
of
war
was
immediately
called
and
while
it
was
in
session
sergeant
corney
made
a
proposition
which
was
like
to
take
away
the
breath
from
those
who
looked
upon
us
of
the
minute
boys
as
mere
children
for
he
said
in
the
tone
of
one
who
knows
whereof
he
speaks
i
been
drillin
a
force
that
can
do
good
work
in
what
before
us
if
they
given
a
show
an
i
answer
for
half
a
dozen
of
guaranteein
they
show
themselves
to
be
men
are
you
speaking
of
the
lads
my
uncle
asked
in
surprise
and
the
old
man
replied
promptly
ay
that
i
am
sir
an
unless
all
signs
fail
there
never
one
of
who
bring
reproach
upon
the
settlement
what
is
your
plan
sergeant
braun
master
dunlap
the
preacher
asked
for
so
great
did
all
believe
the
danger
which
threatened
that
every
man
whether
or
crippled
had
been
summoned
to
the
council
it
ai
what
you
might
rightly
call
a
plan
sir
sergeant
corney
replied
it
only
an
idee
brought
out
by
the
fact
that
from
this
time
we
got
to
keep
a
close
watch
on
what
happenin
in
this
valley
unless
we
willin
to
be
murdered
in
our
beds
there
are
boys
enough
in
the
settlement
to
do
the
scoutin
leavin
the
elders
to
stand
by
for
defence
an
i
see
no
good
reason
why
they
should
perform
full
share
of
military
duty
think
you
a
lad
like
my
nephew
noel
could
render
any
valuable
assistance
at
such
a
time
as
this
my
uncle
asked
with
a
smile
as
if
believing
he
had
put
an
end
to
the
old
man
proposition
and
my
cheeks
reddened
with
excitement
and
fear
lest
sergeant
corney
should
allow
himself
to
be
backed
down
as
i
listened
intently
for
the
answer
it
was
not
long
in
coming
and
i
could
have
kissed
the
old
soldier
for
speaking
as
he
did
give
me
him
an
jacob
sitz
sir
an
i
guarantee
to
follow
thayendanega
an
his
precious
scoundrels
till
we
know
what
deviltry
they
got
in
mind
you
shall
have
full
charge
of
all
the
boys
in
the
settlement
and
we
will
see
if
you
can
make
good
your
boast
my
uncle
who
held
command
of
our
fighting
force
said
after
a
brief
pause
and
in
a
twinkling
sergeant
corney
left
the
building
beckoning
us
lads
to
follow
for
our
company
had
gathered
with
the
men
to
learn
what
was
to
be
done
the
old
soldier
did
not
need
very
much
time
in
which
to
lay
his
plans
in
fact
i
believe
he
had
mapped
out
the
whole
course
before
having
spoken
he
divided
our
company
into
squads
of
six
not
reckoning
in
either
jacob
or
me
and
these
he
gave
stations
at
different
points
within
a
mile
of
the
settlement
cautioning
every
one
to
be
on
the
alert
for
now
had
come
the
time
when
it
was
possible
for
them
to
prove
the
value
of
the
minute
boys
as
soldiers
it
was
to
be
their
duty
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
to
keep
careful
watch
lest
the
indians
creep
up
unawares
and
i
could
well
understand
that
never
one
would
shirk
his
duty
since
upon
their
vigilance
depended
the
lives
or
liberty
of
all
the
dwellers
nearabout
then
when
some
one
asked
why
neither
jacob
nor
i
had
been
assigned
to
sentinel
duty
sergeant
corney
replied
gravely
i
promised
that
with
two
lads
i
would
follow
thayendanega
gang
until
we
found
out
what
the
villains
were
about
as
all
of
you
well
know
within
the
hour
we
three
will
set
off
several
of
the
more
venturesome
lads
pleaded
their
right
to
take
part
in
the
dangerous
service
claiming
that
they
should
not
be
left
at
home
when
it
was
possible
to
make
names
for
themselves
among
men
but
to
all
these
entreaties
sergeant
corney
made
but
one
reply
it
was
colonel
campbell
himself
who
mentioned
noel
name
an
of
a
surety
he
has
the
right
to
say
who
shall
go
or
stay
as
for
jacob
have
any
of
you
a
better
claim
than
he
to
follow
the
murderers
this
silenced
the
eager
ones
but
i
would
have
been
glad
indeed
had
any
member
of
the
company
shown
that
he
had
a
better
right
to
accompany
the
old
soldier
than
i
for
of
a
verity
i
was
not
itching
to
hug
the
heels
of
those
savages
who
were
doing
the
bidding
of
the
tories
however
i
might
have
been
however
i
would
have
bitten
the
end
of
my
tongue
off
before
saying
that
which
should
show
to
my
comrades
that
i
was
more
than
willing
to
remain
behind
for
if
the
captain
of
the
minute
boys
showed
the
white
feather
what
might
not
have
been
excused
in
the
rank
and
file
never
one
of
all
that
company
raised
his
voice
against
my
right
to
follow
sergeant
corney
however
and
i
did
my
best
at
making
it
appear
that
the
work
in
hand
was
exactly
to
my
liking
even
the
dullest
among
us
understood
that
we
three
might
be
absent
from
the
settlement
many
days
and
yet
our
preparations
for
the
dangerous
journey
were
most
simple
i
ran
home
to
acquaint
my
mother
with
what
was
afoot
and
while
she
was
trying
to
keep
back
her
tears
lest
i
might
be
unnerved
for
the
duty
to
which
i
had
been
assigned
i
armed
myself
with
rifle
and
making
certain
each
weapon
was
in
proper
order
from
my
father
store
of
powder
and
balls
i
took
as
much
as
could
be
conveniently
carried
and
this
with
such
small
supply
of
corn
bread
and
salt
pork
as
filled
my
made
up
an
outfit
for
a
journey
from
which
it
was
reasonable
to
believe
i
might
never
return
mother
did
no
more
than
kiss
me
again
and
again
in
silence
when
i
was
ready
to
set
off
and
i
now
understand
that
she
did
not
dare
trust
herself
to
speak
which
i
venture
to
say
saved
me
from
much
sorrow
on
arriving
at
the
green
in
front
of
my
uncle
house
where
we
three
had
agreed
to
meet
i
found
that
jacob
outfit
was
even
less
than
mine
in
his
grief
because
of
his
father
fate
he
had
thought
only
of
his
weapons
and
ammunition
and
by
the
expression
on
his
face
i
knew
full
well
he
would
use
them
manfully
if
we
came
within
striking
distance
of
lieutenant
wormwood
murderers
sergeant
corney
was
equipped
in
much
the
same
fashion
as
was
i
and
immediately
after
my
arrival
he
said
impatiently
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
remain
here
many
minutes
as
if
to
show
ourselves
it
stands
us
in
hand
to
strike
the
trail
while
it
is
yet
warm
an
by
dallyin
the
people
will
come
to
believe
our
only
idee
is
to
look
we
really
are
it
is
for
you
to
say
when
we
shall
set
out
i
replied
envying
those
of
my
comrades
who
stood
near
at
hand
to
witness
the
departure
and
the
words
had
hardly
more
than
been
spoken
before
the
old
man
started
off
at
a
smart
pace
in
the
direction
of
the
thicket
where
lieutenant
wormwood
body
had
so
lately
been
found
as
a
matter
of
course
we
two
lads
followed
i
making
every
effort
to
keep
pace
with
him
lest
those
who
were
watching
should
suspect
i
was
not
as
brave
as
i
looked
and
in
a
few
moments
we
had
shut
out
from
view
the
houses
of
the
settlement
we
were
not
long
in
traversing
the
short
distance
which
led
us
to
the
tree
at
the
foot
of
which
the
officer
came
to
his
death
it
can
well
be
understood
that
we
did
not
linger
many
seconds
in
that
gruesome
locality
jacob
was
eager
to
push
on
hoping
even
against
hope
that
it
might
be
possible
for
him
to
rescue
his
father
sergeant
corney
had
no
desire
to
delay
lest
we
find
it
difficult
to
follow
the
trail
later
in
the
day
and
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
care
to
remain
in
that
place
where
were
such
evidences
as
might
soon
be
found
of
our
own
fate
thayendanega
had
apparently
given
no
heed
as
to
whether
his
movements
were
known
for
never
an
effort
had
been
made
to
cover
the
trail
and
we
followed
it
as
readily
as
if
it
had
been
blazed
when
we
had
travelled
rapidly
in
silence
for
two
full
hours
sergeant
corney
called
a
halt
saying
as
he
did
so
there
no
reason
why
we
should
push
on
so
fast
an
much
need
to
husband
our
strength
for
no
one
can
tell
how
soon
we
may
be
forced
to
take
part
in
a
scrimmage
we
have
a
bite
to
eat
for
i
overload
my
stomach
this
mornin
an
be
all
the
better
for
a
we
did
come
out
to
spend
our
time
in
eatin
jacob
said
moodily
and
i
understood
full
well
what
was
in
his
mind
we
can
loiter
when
we
have
come
up
with
the
savages
it
ai
in
the
plan
that
we
shall
get
too
close
at
their
heels
sergeant
corney
replied
as
he
drew
from
his
a
generous
supply
of
corn
bread
and
laid
a
good
half
of
it
in
front
of
my
comrade
it
may
not
be
in
your
plan
but
it
is
in
mine
jacob
said
sharply
giving
no
heed
to
the
food
we
shall
be
doin
our
duty
by
those
we
have
left
behind
if
we
hug
as
close
to
the
villains
as
is
possible
while
there
no
chance
i
can
serve
my
father
by
hangin
back
at
a
distance
an
it
in
your
mind
lad
that
we
might
do
him
a
good
turn
sergeant
corney
said
as
if
talking
to
himself
why
not
it
would
be
the
first
time
the
murderin
redskins
had
lost
a
prisoner
true
for
you
lad
an
i
know
full
well
how
you
feelin
but
the
question
is
whether
we
can
hope
for
anythin
while
there
sich
a
crowd
of
i
not
expectin
you
an
noel
will
run
your
heads
into
too
much
danger
jacob
said
passionately
i
know
you
would
help
father
if
the
chance
came
your
way
but
it
my
duty
to
take
every
risk
an
i
count
on
doin
so
even
though
we
part
company
within
the
hour
do
you
suppose
i
can
loiter
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
painted
devils
when
my
father
is
expectin
to
see
some
sign
that
i
doin
all
i
may
to
help
him
i
question
if
peter
sitz
expects
that
any
one
from
cherry
valley
will
follow
thayendanega
snakes
he
knows
their
strength
an
is
man
enough
to
understand
what
might
be
the
price
of
an
attempt
to
rescue
him
although
sergeant
corney
spoke
calmly
as
if
he
had
no
vital
interest
in
the
matter
i
knew
him
well
enough
to
feel
certain
he
was
even
then
trying
to
settle
in
his
own
mind
how
a
rescue
might
be
effected
but
jacob
was
so
blinded
by
his
grief
that
at
the
moment
i
believe
he
really
thought
we
would
let
him
push
ahead
alone
therefore
i
said
in
as
hearty
a
tone
as
was
possible
you
should
know
jacob
that
both
of
us
stand
ready
to
do
all
men
may
to
aid
your
father
an
you
may
be
certain
we
not
let
you
go
on
alone
but
just
now
sergeant
corney
must
be
our
leader
since
he
knows
better
than
you
an
i
put
together
what
ought
to
be
done
but
will
he
do
his
best
jacob
cried
in
a
passion
will
he
help
me
or
does
he
think
the
work
is
done
when
we
have
learned
where
joseph
brant
has
gone
on
his
work
of
bloodshed
i
waited
for
the
old
soldier
to
make
reply
to
this
demand
and
he
hesitated
so
long
that
i
began
to
fear
i
had
been
mistaken
as
to
that
which
i
had
supposed
was
in
his
mind
at
last
when
it
seemed
as
if
jacob
could
no
longer
restrain
his
impatience
sergeant
corney
said
speaking
slowly
as
if
weighing
well
each
word
i
will
do
my
best
heedin
not
my
own
safety
givin
no
thought
to
the
labor
or
difficulties
if
it
so
be
you
lads
are
minded
to
do
as
i
shall
say
without
questionin
when
it
seems
as
if
i
might
be
goin
wrong
i
would
have
interrupted
him
with
an
assurance
that
we
were
willing
to
serve
him
faithfully
but
he
checked
me
with
a
gesture
and
added
as
peter
sitz
would
were
he
in
my
place
so
will
i
he
was
my
friend
i
know
if
it
was
a
question
of
savin
the
lives
of
those
at
cherry
valley
or
turnin
his
back
on
me
what
he
would
do
an
even
so
shall
i
meanin
what
jacob
demanded
fiercely
meanin
that
while
we
can
do
our
duty
by
those
who
sent
us
we
will
strain
every
nerve
in
his
behalf
but
if
it
should
so
chance
that
their
safety
depended
upon
us
we
would
give
service
to
the
greatest
number
jacob
stared
as
if
not
understanding
what
the
old
man
had
said
and
i
made
haste
to
add
he
means
that
if
while
followin
brant
with
the
hope
of
aidin
your
father
we
found
out
that
danger
threatened
the
settlement
it
would
be
our
duty
to
warn
them
rather
than
hold
on
for
him
the
old
soldier
nodded
in
token
that
i
had
but
given
different
words
to
his
idea
and
jacob
replied
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
i
can
ask
for
nothin
more
if
it
so
happens
that
you
must
turn
back
i
can
keep
on
for
two
would
aid
the
settlement
as
much
as
three
ay
lad
you
shall
then
do
as
seems
best
to
you
sergeant
corney
said
solemnly
and
thus
it
was
settled
that
while
it
did
not
interfere
with
our
duty
as
minute
boys
of
the
mohawk
valley
all
our
efforts
should
be
for
the
relief
of
the
unfortunate
prisoner
although
at
the
time
i
had
little
hope
the
savages
would
allow
him
to
live
many
days
having
thus
pledged
himself
to
jacob
sergeant
corney
showed
no
further
disposition
to
husband
his
strength
but
led
us
on
the
march
once
more
and
this
time
at
a
pace
which
we
lads
found
difficult
to
maintain
without
actually
running
now
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
set
down
all
we
did
and
said
during
this
long
chase
it
would
be
of
no
interest
to
a
stranger
since
one
hour
was
much
like
another
until
we
were
come
near
to
the
indian
town
of
oghkwaga
where
brant
usually
made
his
headquarters
while
bent
on
such
cruel
work
as
that
of
harrying
the
settlers
who
favored
the
rebellion
against
the
king
and
it
is
not
necessary
i
should
write
down
here
the
fact
that
thayendanega
was
in
the
pay
of
the
british
it
seemed
much
as
if
the
indians
had
no
care
as
to
whether
they
were
being
followed
for
instead
of
sending
back
scouts
along
the
trail
as
brant
almost
always
did
the
party
remained
in
a
body
and
even
when
we
were
so
close
on
them
as
to
lie
down
within
view
of
their
at
night
we
never
saw
one
of
the
painted
villains
who
appeared
curious
to
know
if
any
person
was
in
the
rear
we
were
within
a
day
march
of
the
indian
town
and
had
lain
down
in
a
thicket
of
spruce
bushes
after
having
looked
in
vain
for
some
signs
of
a
prisoner
as
we
had
done
during
each
of
the
four
days
while
we
were
directly
behind
the
band
and
at
no
time
more
than
two
miles
distant
jacob
face
was
wrinkled
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
with
lines
drawn
by
sorrow
because
we
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
a
glimpse
of
his
father
and
it
was
evident
that
the
lad
was
beginning
to
fear
as
did
i
that
the
savages
finding
a
prisoner
too
troublesome
had
tortured
him
to
death
for
if
master
sitz
was
yet
alive
and
in
the
keeping
of
brant
followers
why
had
we
not
got
a
glimpse
of
him
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
grieve
so
deeply
lad
sergeant
corney
said
as
if
he
could
read
the
boy
thoughts
i
answer
for
it
that
your
father
is
as
much
alive
as
we
are
how
can
you
be
certain
of
that
jacob
asked
moodily
we
have
seen
every
one
of
their
camps
eh
of
course
jacob
replied
impatiently
an
have
you
noted
any
sign
of
a
prisoner
havin
been
tortured
a
tree
a
pile
of
rocks
near
the
fire
or
sich
other
like
thing
jacob
shook
his
head
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
calmly
of
such
a
possibility
no
you
have
an
we
know
without
bein
told
that
when
sich
devils
as
follow
joe
brant
get
a
prisoner
in
their
clutches
they
never
kill
him
without
torture
now
to
my
way
of
thinkin
we
can
count
to
a
certainty
that
he
alive
then
why
have
we
come
across
him
jacob
demanded
fiercely
this
is
the
fourth
time
we
had
their
camp
in
full
view
an
if
he
was
with
we
ought
to
have
seen
somethin
of
him
i
allow
you
right
lad
an
that
why
i
come
to
believe
that
been
sent
on
ahead
to
the
village
then
i
must
be
movin
jacob
cried
springing
suddenly
to
his
feet
i
should
have
had
sense
enough
to
guess
that
before
and
he
made
as
if
he
would
leave
us
but
sergeant
corney
pulled
him
back
by
the
wait
a
bit
it
was
on
my
tongue
end
to
propose
somethin
of
the
same
kind
but
we
ca
afford
to
take
the
chances
of
makin
a
move
till
yonder
nest
of
snakes
has
settled
down
for
the
night
an
hour
from
now
an
all
pull
out
jacob
could
not
well
have
made
complaint
after
this
and
he
settled
down
with
his
back
against
a
tree
to
wait
with
so
much
of
patience
as
he
could
summon
until
the
old
soldier
should
give
the
word
it
surprised
me
that
jacob
was
not
utterly
cast
down
by
the
possibility
that
his
father
had
already
been
carried
to
the
indian
village
for
once
there
we
could
not
hope
to
effect
a
rescue
but
since
this
thought
had
apparently
never
come
into
his
mind
it
was
not
for
me
to
add
to
his
distress
by
suggesting
it
well
we
remained
in
the
thicket
until
the
red
villains
had
quieted
down
for
the
night
and
then
sergeant
corney
led
us
toward
the
south
that
we
might
make
a
long
circle
around
the
encampment
when
would
come
the
most
dangerous
portion
of
our
task
thus
far
we
had
done
as
jacob
would
have
us
and
at
the
same
time
performed
our
full
duty
as
minute
boys
for
our
task
was
to
learn
what
brant
counted
on
doing
and
as
to
that
we
could
not
be
certain
until
he
was
in
the
village
but
now
that
the
old
soldier
was
leading
us
around
the
encampment
to
the
end
that
we
might
gain
a
position
between
brant
force
and
those
at
oghkwaga
i
said
to
myself
with
many
an
inward
shudder
that
we
were
like
to
join
jacob
father
after
a
different
fashion
than
we
had
counted
on
it
was
as
if
sergeant
corney
had
no
fear
as
to
what
might
happen
for
he
plunged
into
the
gloom
of
the
forest
like
a
man
who
walks
among
friends
and
jacob
followed
carelessly
all
his
thoughts
on
the
possible
whereabouts
of
the
prisoner
he
was
so
eager
to
see
apparently
i
was
the
only
member
of
the
party
who
gave
heed
to
his
steps
and
so
timid
had
i
become
through
looking
into
the
future
for
danger
that
it
was
only
with
difficulty
i
repressed
a
cry
of
alarm
when
sergeant
corney
came
to
a
sudden
halt
as
if
he
had
stumbled
upon
an
enemy
jacob
wrapped
in
his
own
gloomy
thoughts
halted
without
showing
signs
of
curiosity
or
surprise
but
i
pressed
forward
eagerly
until
standing
close
behind
the
old
soldier
and
then
i
understood
full
well
why
he
had
stopped
not
thirty
paces
from
where
we
remained
hidden
in
the
thicket
it
was
possible
to
see
the
gleam
of
a
and
to
hear
the
faint
hum
of
voices
as
if
a
large
party
was
near
at
hand
after
vainly
trying
to
peer
through
the
foliage
sergeant
corney
moved
cautiously
forward
two
or
three
paces
and
as
a
matter
of
course
i
followed
close
at
his
heels
far
enough
to
see
the
reflection
of
four
or
five
other
fires
as
if
those
around
them
had
no
fear
of
being
discovered
they
must
be
britishers
i
whispered
and
sergeant
corney
gripped
my
hand
as
if
to
say
that
he
was
of
the
same
idea
it
was
our
duty
however
to
know
exactly
who
it
was
encamped
so
near
brant
village
and
after
telling
jacob
in
a
whisper
of
what
we
had
seen
the
old
soldier
made
his
way
swiftly
through
the
thicket
my
comrade
and
i
copying
his
every
movement
then
when
i
had
decided
that
we
were
dangerously
near
a
large
force
of
the
king
soldiers
who
had
come
to
join
thayendanega
in
his
murderous
work
sergeant
corney
called
out
in
a
loud
tone
in
the
camp
here
come
friends
who
were
like
to
have
run
over
you
in
a
twinkling
the
command
was
aroused
and
before
i
had
fully
gathered
my
wits
which
had
been
scattered
by
the
old
soldier
hail
i
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
large
body
of
men
many
of
whom
i
had
seen
in
my
home
at
cherry
valley
and
now
that
i
may
not
dwell
too
long
on
a
commonplace
story
when
i
have
so
much
of
adventure
to
relate
let
me
say
that
we
had
stumbled
on
upwards
of
three
hundred
men
belonging
to
the
patriot
army
who
under
command
of
general
herkimer
were
bent
on
paying
a
friendly
visit
to
the
indian
village
as
we
soon
learned
general
herkimer
having
been
intimately
acquainted
with
brant
hoped
by
an
interview
to
persuade
the
sachem
to
join
the
patriots
or
at
least
to
remain
neutral
and
to
such
end
had
invited
the
chief
to
meet
him
at
unadilla
for
a
powwow
at
the
same
time
that
general
herkimer
had
set
out
to
find
brant
colonel
van
schaick
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
went
to
cherry
valley
even
as
poor
lieutenant
wormwood
had
announced
and
the
remainder
of
the
american
force
in
the
vicinity
was
encamped
at
the
proposed
rendezvous
lest
the
treacherous
chief
accept
the
invitation
simply
in
order
to
work
mischief
we
march
with
this
company
sergeant
corney
said
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
an
it
will
be
possible
to
have
a
look
at
the
village
without
runnin
too
many
chances
of
losin
our
hair
and
thus
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
our
troubles
were
over
for
i
doubted
not
but
that
general
herkimer
could
induce
the
savages
to
give
up
their
prisoner
and
we
would
soon
be
on
our
way
home
with
peter
sitz
as
a
companion
but
instead
we
were
just
at
the
beginning
of
our
difficulties
chapter
ii
the
powwow
when
we
had
learned
all
that
our
acquaintances
among
the
command
could
tell
us
jacob
insisted
that
sergeant
corney
see
general
herkimer
without
delay
in
order
to
learn
if
that
officer
would
so
far
interest
himself
in
the
fate
of
peter
sitz
as
to
make
inquiries
of
thayendanega
regarding
him
in
case
the
opportunity
offered
at
first
the
old
soldier
was
not
inclined
to
ask
for
an
interview
with
the
commander
claiming
that
his
own
rank
was
not
sufficiently
high
to
warrant
his
making
such
a
request
but
those
of
the
force
who
were
listening
to
our
conversation
insisted
that
the
general
was
not
a
stickler
for
rank
and
would
receive
a
private
soldier
with
as
much
consideration
as
the
commander
of
a
brigade
therefore
it
was
that
after
being
alternately
urged
and
entreated
for
half
an
hour
sergeant
corney
agreed
to
do
as
jacob
desired
and
straightway
set
about
seeking
the
leader
which
was
no
difficult
task
since
his
camp
was
a
of
fir
boughs
standing
hardly
more
than
fifty
feet
from
where
we
were
sitting
after
the
old
man
had
left
us
one
of
the
soldiers
asked
if
we
had
seen
any
tories
with
thayendanega
band
and
i
told
him
that
so
far
as
i
had
been
able
to
learn
the
only
white
man
among
them
was
peter
sitz
although
we
had
not
been
so
fortunate
as
to
see
him
why
did
you
want
to
know
jacob
asked
with
mild
curiosity
and
the
man
replied
it
struck
me
that
if
any
of
the
mohawk
valley
tories
were
with
brant
general
herkimer
would
stand
little
chance
of
doing
anything
to
aid
the
prisoner
why
do
you
say
that
the
general
would
hardly
be
able
to
do
anythin
of
the
kind
i
asked
surely
to
one
so
high
in
command
brant
would
listen
when
he
might
refuse
even
to
speak
with
one
of
less
rank
the
thought
was
not
in
my
mind
that
thayendanega
himself
would
be
opposed
to
our
commander
but
if
you
know
what
was
done
last
year
it
is
easy
to
understand
my
meaning
to
me
the
soldier
was
speaking
in
riddles
and
i
asked
for
an
explanation
whereupon
he
told
us
that
more
than
a
year
ago
when
the
johnsons
had
collected
a
large
force
of
men
nearabout
johnson
hall
and
among
them
fully
three
hundred
scotch
soldiers
general
schuyler
marched
with
nearly
three
thousand
militia
to
within
four
miles
of
the
settlement
demanding
that
sir
john
surrender
all
arms
ammunition
and
warlike
stores
in
his
possession
together
with
the
weapons
and
military
accoutrements
then
held
by
the
tories
and
indians
under
his
command
in
addition
to
which
the
baronet
was
required
to
give
his
parole
of
honor
that
he
would
not
attempt
any
act
against
the
patriot
cause
sir
john
was
at
first
furious
because
such
a
demand
had
been
made
but
badly
frightened
by
general
schuyler
display
of
force
he
finally
consented
since
he
could
do
nothing
better
and
the
colonists
marched
to
johnson
hall
where
the
surrender
was
made
then
it
was
that
general
herkimer
was
detailed
to
disarm
the
tories
in
the
valley
and
while
carrying
out
such
orders
quite
naturally
made
enemies
of
the
majority
of
them
therefore
it
was
according
to
the
belief
of
the
soldier
that
general
herkimer
would
have
little
or
no
weight
with
brant
so
far
as
rescuing
peter
sitz
was
concerned
if
there
chanced
at
the
moment
to
be
tories
near
at
hand
to
whisper
in
his
ear
just
now
it
seems
necessary
for
me
to
set
down
that
which
happened
after
sir
john
johnson
surrender
if
so
it
could
be
called
to
general
schuyler
and
i
can
best
do
it
by
copying
that
which
i
have
seen
in
a
printed
sheet
concerning
our
troubles
in
the
mohawk
valley
it
soon
afterward
became
evident
that
what
sir
john
had
promised
when
constrained
by
fear
would
not
be
performed
when
the
cause
of
that
fear
was
removed
he
violated
his
parole
of
honor
and
the
highlanders
began
to
be
as
bold
as
ever
in
their
oppressions
of
the
whigs
congress
thought
it
dangerous
to
allow
johnson
his
liberty
and
directed
schuyler
to
seize
his
person
and
to
proceed
vigorously
against
the
highlanders
in
his
vicinity
colonel
dayton
was
entrusted
with
the
command
of
the
expedition
for
the
purpose
and
in
may
he
proceeded
to
johnstown
the
baronet
had
friends
among
the
loyalists
in
albany
by
whom
he
was
timely
informed
of
the
intentions
of
congress
hastily
collecting
a
large
number
of
scotchmen
and
other
tories
he
fled
to
the
woods
by
the
way
of
the
sacandaga
where
it
is
supposed
they
were
met
by
indians
sent
from
canada
to
escort
them
thither
for
a
certain
time
afterward
in
one
of
his
speeches
thayendanega
said
went
in
a
body
to
the
town
then
in
possession
of
the
enemy
and
rescued
sir
john
johnson
bringing
him
fearlessly
through
the
streets
amid
perils
and
hardships
of
every
kind
the
baronet
and
his
companions
traversed
the
wilderness
between
the
headwaters
of
the
hudson
and
the
lawrence
and
after
nineteen
days
wanderings
arrived
at
montreal
sir
john
was
immediately
commissioned
a
colonel
in
the
british
service
he
raised
two
battalions
of
loyalists
called
the
johnson
greens
and
declared
himself
the
bitterest
and
most
implacable
enemy
of
the
americans
now
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
from
information
which
we
had
received
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
brant
had
come
to
place
himself
and
his
following
under
sir
john
command
and
that
before
many
days
were
passed
we
might
expect
the
mohawk
valley
would
be
overflowed
by
all
the
tories
who
had
previously
fled
to
canada
thus
it
can
be
understood
that
there
would
be
such
bloodshed
and
deeds
of
violence
as
had
never
before
been
known
in
the
province
of
new
york
with
this
in
mind
one
can
better
understand
why
sergeant
corney
made
the
reservation
which
he
did
when
promising
jacob
he
would
do
all
within
his
power
up
to
a
certain
point
to
aid
in
the
rescue
of
his
father
the
old
soldier
returned
from
his
interview
with
general
herkimer
at
about
the
same
time
our
newly
made
friend
finished
his
recital
of
what
had
been
done
in
and
around
johnson
hall
and
observing
the
look
of
satisfaction
on
the
sergeant
face
i
understood
even
before
he
spoke
that
his
mission
had
been
at
least
in
a
certain
degree
successful
it
is
all
right
lads
he
said
seating
himself
by
my
side
the
general
will
do
what
he
can
but
whether
that
be
much
or
little
depends
upon
the
way
in
which
thayendanega
receives
him
are
we
to
march
with
this
command
to
the
village
jacob
asked
ay
an
remain
with
it
so
long
as
suits
our
purpose
it
seemed
to
me
we
could
not
in
reason
ask
for
anything
more
that
we
were
now
in
the
best
possible
position
to
learn
what
brant
purpose
was
and
at
the
same
time
to
aid
peter
sitz
therefore
i
laid
down
to
rest
contented
in
mind
as
i
was
wearied
in
body
but
poor
jacob
feeling
as
if
he
might
in
some
way
wrong
his
father
by
seeking
repose
paced
to
and
fro
near
the
until
my
eyes
were
closed
in
slumber
the
soldiers
were
astir
at
an
early
hour
next
morning
but
before
the
column
could
be
set
in
motion
an
indian
strode
gravely
into
the
encampment
waving
a
bit
of
white
cloth
and
on
being
questioned
by
the
sentinels
announced
himself
as
a
messenger
sent
by
thayendanega
with
words
to
general
herkimer
the
fact
of
his
early
arrival
was
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
wily
sachem
had
known
of
the
movements
of
the
soldiers
for
a
certain
length
of
time
perhaps
several
days
and
this
might
explain
why
his
march
from
cherry
valley
had
been
so
steady
and
swift
it
goes
without
saying
that
every
man
in
the
encampment
was
eager
to
know
why
this
painted
messenger
had
come
and
i
confess
to
crowding
my
way
among
the
foremost
of
the
curious
in
order
to
hear
if
possible
all
that
was
said
the
indian
stood
like
a
statue
before
the
shelter
of
fir
boughs
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
until
general
herkimer
appeared
and
said
to
him
questioningly
you
have
come
from
captain
brant
it
is
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
set
it
down
that
some
time
before
this
thayendanega
had
been
given
a
commission
in
the
british
service
the
messenger
nodded
gravely
and
after
pausing
until
one
might
have
counted
ten
said
thayendanega
asks
why
so
many
white
soldiers
are
encamped
near
his
village
i
have
come
to
see
and
talk
with
my
brother
captain
brant
general
herkimer
replied
with
the
same
stiff
manner
as
that
assumed
by
the
messenger
and
do
all
these
men
want
to
talk
with
the
chief
too
they
have
come
to
bear
me
company
they
are
my
followers
as
captain
brant
has
his
and
do
they
also
call
thayendanega
ay
and
they
hope
he
a
brother
to
them
the
indian
turned
slowly
in
what
i
thought
a
most
offensive
manner
as
he
looked
around
at
the
faces
of
those
who
completely
encircled
him
and
then
would
have
moved
away
but
that
general
herkimer
asked
is
captain
brant
in
his
village
he
will
tell
his
white
brother
where
he
may
be
found
after
i
can
run
five
miles
meaning
that
you
will
go
from
me
to
him
and
return
the
general
asked
but
it
was
as
if
the
indian
did
not
hear
the
question
for
he
said
in
a
tone
which
to
me
was
one
of
menace
you
will
come
no
nearer
oghkwaga
until
thayendanega
shall
give
his
permission
having
said
this
he
turned
slowly
about
until
facing
the
direction
where
i
knew
brant
and
his
followers
encamped
the
night
previous
when
he
stalked
slowly
away
giving
no
more
heed
to
those
who
pressed
closely
to
him
than
if
he
was
the
only
person
in
that
vast
wilderness
to
jacob
this
enforced
halt
at
a
time
when
he
believed
it
was
vitally
necessary
he
should
be
making
search
for
his
father
was
most
painful
and
despite
all
sergeant
corney
and
i
could
say
or
do
to
relieve
his
distress
of
mind
the
poor
lad
paced
to
and
fro
as
i
was
told
he
had
during
the
long
hours
of
the
night
in
a
nervous
condition
pitiable
to
behold
when
half
an
hour
or
more
had
passed
the
old
soldier
said
to
me
in
a
more
kindly
tone
than
i
had
ever
suspected
he
could
use
the
lad
is
eatin
his
heart
out
an
all
to
no
purpose
ca
you
quiet
him
a
bit
noel
i
have
said
all
within
my
power
an
he
turns
a
deaf
ear
i
replied
sadly
then
i
shall
try
my
fist
at
it
and
the
old
man
went
up
to
my
comrade
taking
him
gently
by
the
hand
and
leading
him
into
the
thicket
just
beyond
view
of
the
encampment
there
the
two
seemingly
conversed
for
a
long
time
and
i
was
left
comparatively
alone
until
the
soldier
who
had
told
us
of
general
herkimer
doings
nearabout
johnson
hall
came
up
eager
to
get
some
idea
of
what
the
commander
might
be
able
to
do
with
this
joseph
brant
whose
name
stood
in
my
mind
for
all
that
was
horrible
in
the
way
of
cruelty
i
asked
how
it
was
that
general
herkimer
could
hope
to
influence
one
who
was
such
a
great
enemy
to
the
whigs
of
the
mohawk
valley
and
in
fact
to
all
white
men
save
those
who
wore
the
uniform
of
the
british
king
he
told
me
that
at
one
time
before
thayendanega
had
become
so
powerful
a
sachem
he
and
general
herkimer
were
near
neighbors
and
quite
intimate
friends
it
seems
from
the
story
this
soldier
told
me
that
sir
william
johnson
sir
john
father
sent
the
indian
boy
to
school
and
after
he
had
received
a
good
education
gave
him
employment
as
secretary
during
three
years
this
now
bloodthirsty
savage
acted
as
missionary
interpreter
and
it
was
said
he
did
very
much
for
the
religious
instruction
of
his
tribe
when
the
colonists
revolted
against
the
oppressive
rule
of
the
king
brant
took
the
same
side
as
did
his
patron
and
having
received
a
commission
some
have
said
it
was
a
captaincy
and
others
that
it
was
a
colonelcy
he
became
one
of
the
most
vengeful
enemies
we
who
were
devoted
to
the
cause
had
now
because
of
the
past
general
herkimer
hoped
to
turn
him
aside
from
his
chosen
path
when
he
was
just
coming
into
power
and
boy
though
i
was
it
seemed
to
me
a
hopeless
task
one
which
had
better
never
have
been
attempted
since
in
case
of
failure
it
would
show
to
thayendanega
that
the
whigs
of
the
valley
believed
him
an
enemy
who
should
be
placated
rather
than
resisted
however
that
was
none
of
my
affairs
and
i
was
not
so
forward
as
to
air
my
views
then
when
i
was
only
a
by
the
sufferance
of
the
commander
in
two
hours
from
the
time
he
left
our
camp
the
indian
messenger
returned
still
carrying
the
bit
of
white
cloth
and
came
among
us
as
if
expecting
we
would
bow
before
him
he
was
barely
civil
when
general
herkimer
advanced
to
receive
him
and
without
greeting
the
commander
he
pointed
toward
a
clearing
in
the
wilderness
half
a
mile
or
more
away
as
he
said
there
will
thayendanega
meet
his
brother
the
white
chief
and
without
firearms
general
herkimer
asked
when
the
next
sun
is
three
hours
old
thayendanega
will
come
with
forty
of
his
people
and
his
white
brother
will
bring
no
more
than
that
number
it
is
well
general
herkimer
replied
and
it
pleased
me
that
he
held
himself
yet
more
stiffly
than
did
the
messenger
say
to
my
brother
captain
brant
that
we
also
will
come
without
arms
and
he
and
i
shall
meet
as
we
met
years
ago
when
there
was
no
need
to
light
the
pipe
of
peace
because
neither
of
us
had
listened
to
the
songs
of
wicked
men
the
indian
stalked
away
as
before
and
when
he
was
gone
jacob
who
with
sergeant
corney
had
come
up
to
hear
what
was
being
said
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
affectionately
i
am
goin
to
be
more
of
a
man
noel
havin
come
to
understand
that
nothin
can
be
gained
by
or
impatience
but
it
is
hard
to
remain
here
idle
when
perhaps
my
father
may
at
this
moment
be
suffering
torture
if
it
was
some
one
else
father
jacob
you
would
say
that
there
was
no
danger
anything
of
the
kind
would
happen
while
brant
is
makin
ready
for
the
interview
with
general
herkimer
until
that
has
come
to
an
end
your
father
is
safe
an
perhaps
when
the
powwow
is
over
we
shall
have
him
with
us
so
sergeant
corney
has
been
tryin
to
make
me
believe
an
it
must
be
true
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
jacob
did
not
give
words
to
the
sorrow
which
was
in
his
heart
and
perhaps
it
would
have
been
wiser
had
he
not
tried
to
hold
his
peace
for
strive
as
he
might
again
and
again
i
could
see
how
earnestly
he
was
struggling
to
remain
silent
it
is
useless
for
me
to
attempt
to
set
down
all
that
we
did
or
said
while
awaiting
thayendanega
pleasure
as
a
matter
of
course
we
indulged
in
much
speculation
regarding
the
outcome
of
the
matter
and
discussed
at
great
length
the
possibility
of
general
herkimer
being
able
even
if
he
failed
in
other
desired
directions
to
set
free
the
prisoner
whom
joseph
brant
doubtless
intended
should
suffer
death
at
the
stake
we
passed
the
time
as
best
we
might
many
of
us
finding
it
quite
as
difficult
as
did
jacob
to
restrain
our
impatience
and
not
a
few
openly
declaring
their
belief
that
brant
was
holding
us
idle
simply
that
he
might
the
better
carry
out
some
murderous
scheme
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
did
seem
to
me
no
more
than
prudent
general
herkimer
should
send
out
scouts
to
discover
what
the
indians
were
doing
and
it
was
whispered
about
the
encampment
that
one
of
his
officers
had
suggested
that
such
a
precaution
be
taken
but
the
commander
flatly
refused
stating
as
his
reason
that
it
might
prove
fatal
to
all
his
hopes
if
the
sachem
should
learn
he
was
in
any
way
suspicious
because
of
the
delay
we
must
take
our
chances
remaining
here
idle
and
ignorant
of
what
they
may
be
doing
or
it
were
better
we
faced
about
on
the
homeward
march
at
once
the
general
was
reported
to
have
said
and
after
that
he
would
have
been
a
bold
man
indeed
who
suggested
any
other
course
well
the
day
passed
and
so
did
the
night
as
all
days
and
nights
will
whether
one
possesses
his
soul
with
patience
or
frets
against
that
which
he
can
not
remedy
and
general
herkimer
stood
in
the
opening
of
his
fir
camp
gazing
at
the
men
as
if
trying
to
decide
whom
he
should
take
with
him
to
the
powwow
when
jacob
stepped
out
in
full
view
in
order
to
attract
the
commander
attention
i
knew
that
he
made
this
move
with
the
hope
of
being
numbered
among
those
who
would
leave
camp
to
go
to
the
rendezvous
but
at
the
same
moment
i
feared
lest
the
general
might
be
displeased
because
of
his
forwardness
anything
can
be
forgiven
in
a
lad
who
burns
with
the
desire
to
aid
his
father
however
and
general
herkimer
beckoned
for
my
comrade
to
approach
i
could
not
hear
what
was
said
during
the
brief
conversation
but
it
was
easy
to
guess
the
purport
when
jacob
came
toward
me
with
sparkling
eyes
we
have
the
general
permission
to
go
with
him
to
meet
brant
he
cried
and
i
asked
with
perhaps
just
a
tinge
of
jealousy
meanin
you
an
sergeant
corney
eh
the
three
of
us
so
the
general
said
why
did
he
happen
to
count
me
in
he
asked
how
many
had
come
with
sergeant
corney
an
when
i
told
him
he
said
that
all
three
of
us
could
go
with
the
detachment
as
a
matter
of
course
we
went
taking
our
stations
at
the
head
of
the
column
just
behind
the
commander
and
when
the
word
to
march
had
been
given
i
began
to
regret
having
thus
been
favored
for
never
one
of
us
carried
a
weapon
of
any
kind
and
if
brant
was
in
the
humor
he
could
have
us
all
butchered
before
those
whom
we
had
left
behind
would
get
an
inkling
of
what
was
going
on
when
we
had
come
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
which
had
been
pointed
out
by
the
messenger
our
further
advance
was
stopped
by
two
indians
who
were
rigged
out
in
all
the
bravery
of
feathers
beads
and
robes
nothing
missing
in
their
toilet
save
the
and
told
to
remain
at
that
spot
until
the
sachem
and
his
party
arrived
it
was
treating
general
herkimer
rather
shabbily
so
i
thought
to
force
him
to
wait
like
a
child
until
the
master
was
ready
to
put
in
an
appearance
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
and
we
squatted
on
the
ferns
and
rocks
a
full
before
the
man
who
was
soon
to
be
the
great
sachem
of
the
six
nations
was
pleased
to
show
himself
thayendanega
had
gotten
himself
up
especially
for
the
occasion
and
a
more
gorgeous
redskin
i
never
saw
he
had
forty
or
more
savages
with
him
and
strutted
on
at
their
head
as
if
he
was
a
king
and
we
who
had
been
waiting
so
long
no
more
than
the
dirt
beneath
his
feet
then
suddenly
as
if
until
that
moment
he
had
the
slightest
idea
general
herkimer
was
anywhere
in
the
vicinity
he
sent
one
of
his
company
to
our
commander
he
himself
continuing
to
move
on
until
he
stood
in
the
very
centre
of
the
clearing
his
followers
ranged
themselves
behind
him
in
a
remaining
ten
or
twelve
feet
in
the
rear
and
when
the
general
went
to
meet
his
high
mightiness
our
people
took
up
their
stations
much
as
had
the
savages
thus
completely
surrounding
the
two
leaders
jacob
and
i
stood
where
we
could
see
all
that
was
taking
place
and
hear
a
portion
of
what
was
said
thayendanega
began
with
compliments
and
after
general
herkimer
had
replied
in
much
the
same
strain
the
murdering
villain
asked
bluntly
why
he
had
come
to
meet
my
old
neighbor
and
friend
general
herkimer
replied
whereupon
brant
asked
and
have
all
those
behind
you
come
on
a
friendly
visit
too
do
they
also
want
to
see
the
poor
indian
it
is
very
kind
the
general
changed
the
subject
of
the
conversation
by
speaking
of
the
past
and
wound
up
by
hinting
that
it
might
be
to
thayendanega
advantage
to
take
sides
with
the
colonists
against
the
king
but
he
must
soon
have
seen
that
he
was
not
making
much
headway
for
the
sachem
began
to
show
signs
of
anger
and
after
quite
a
long
confab
said
sharply
we
are
with
the
king
as
were
our
fathers
before
us
the
king
belts
are
yet
held
by
us
and
we
can
not
break
faith
you
are
resolute
now
in
your
rebellion
but
before
many
days
the
king
soldiers
will
humble
you
to
the
dust
when
this
had
been
said
colonel
cox
who
was
one
of
the
general
party
cried
sharply
and
heeding
not
the
fact
that
his
voice
was
raised
high
we
did
not
come
here
to
listen
to
threats
and
if
we
are
humbled
it
will
not
be
by
such
as
those
who
follow
joseph
brant
unfortunately
every
indian
in
the
clearing
heard
the
words
distinctly
and
in
a
twinkling
the
savages
were
running
to
and
fro
giving
vent
to
shrill
while
they
called
for
those
at
the
main
encampment
to
bring
their
weapons
the
colonel
incautious
words
were
as
a
lighted
match
to
gunpowder
and
for
the
instant
i
firmly
believed
we
would
pay
for
his
indiscretion
with
our
lives
chapter
iii
disappointment
during
this
time
of
confusion
when
the
life
of
every
white
man
in
the
clearing
was
literally
trembling
in
the
balance
general
herkimer
passed
the
word
from
one
to
another
that
we
were
all
to
stand
firm
without
show
of
fear
and
at
the
same
time
making
no
move
which
might
be
construed
as
in
enmity
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
remain
silent
and
motionless
while
the
painted
villains
were
running
to
and
fro
making
a
hideous
outcry
and
as
we
knew
full
well
aching
to
strike
us
down
i
know
that
as
for
myself
i
trembled
like
a
leaf
upon
an
so
violently
that
at
times
i
feared
the
howling
wretches
would
see
the
quivering
of
my
limbs
and
understand
that
already
was
i
getting
a
foretaste
of
the
death
which
they
would
have
dealt
out
but
for
the
restraining
presence
of
thayendanega
it
was
but
natural
i
should
look
toward
sergeant
corney
and
surely
if
there
was
one
man
in
that
clearing
who
obeyed
general
herkimer
command
it
was
he
a
graven
image
could
not
have
been
more
stolid
one
would
have
said
that
the
uproar
everywhere
around
was
as
the
rippling
of
waters
to
him
and
the
indians
of
less
consequence
than
the
dancing
shafts
of
sunlight
flickering
amid
the
leaves
when
they
are
stirred
by
the
morning
breeze
i
question
if
jacob
realized
anything
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
all
his
thoughts
were
centred
upon
the
one
idea
of
rescuing
his
father
while
there
was
yet
time
and
the
lad
waited
eagerly
for
the
conference
between
the
leaders
regarding
the
prisoner
to
be
begun
heeding
the
remainder
of
the
howling
gang
hardly
more
than
did
sergeant
corney
colonel
cox
the
cause
of
all
this
disturbance
was
even
more
terrified
than
i
as
could
be
told
by
the
expression
on
his
face
and
the
pressed
deeply
into
the
palms
of
his
hands
that
he
might
control
himself
in
obedience
to
orders
while
as
for
the
others
i
know
not
how
they
deported
themselves
at
that
instant
my
world
was
of
small
dimensions
consisting
of
only
so
much
earth
as
that
impassive
red
man
and
the
honest
patriot
officer
stood
upon
like
bees
the
angry
indians
swarmed
to
and
fro
between
the
encampment
and
our
place
of
meeting
until
all
were
armed
with
rifles
and
it
needed
but
the
lightest
word
to
convert
that
sunlit
clearing
into
a
theatre
of
the
bloodiest
deed
in
the
history
of
the
tribe
whose
wildest
delight
was
the
shedding
of
blood
not
until
his
followers
were
in
such
a
frenzied
condition
that
it
seemed
impossible
another
will
could
restrain
them
did
thayendanega
speak
and
then
in
a
few
words
of
the
indian
language
uttered
in
so
low
a
tone
that
i
could
not
distinguish
a
single
syllable
he
calmed
the
tempest
on
the
instant
until
those
who
had
been
howling
for
our
lives
became
like
lambs
when
all
was
hushed
once
more
the
sachem
said
to
general
herkimer
speaking
calmly
almost
indifferently
the
has
been
opened
across
the
country
as
far
as
esopus
and
the
tories
of
ulster
and
orange
will
join
with
the
braves
of
tribe
to
quell
this
revolt
against
the
king
who
is
their
father
now
it
was
that
general
herkimer
spoke
earnestly
pleadingly
do
not
allow
so
weighty
a
question
to
be
settled
without
further
consideration
captain
brant
why
should
not
you
and
i
discuss
it
calmly
as
we
have
in
the
olden
days
many
a
matter
which
was
not
so
grave
you
have
seen
how
well
inclined
my
young
men
are
toward
anything
of
that
kind
brant
said
with
a
cruel
smile
were
i
to
say
at
this
moment
that
we
would
consider
the
matter
in
council
it
might
not
be
possible
even
for
me
to
restrain
them
because
their
decision
has
already
been
made
the
hatchet
is
raised
but
surely
you
and
i
captain
brant
may
talk
of
it
among
ourselves
yes
that
can
be
done
thayendanega
replied
indifferently
and
if
it
gives
you
pleasure
to
indulge
in
what
can
be
of
no
profit
we
will
meet
here
again
morning
but
now
it
were
wiser
my
young
men
went
back
to
the
encampment
then
the
sachem
turned
as
if
to
move
away
and
general
herkimer
remembering
what
he
had
promised
sergeant
corney
and
jacob
said
in
a
friendly
tone
wait
one
moment
captain
brant
i
would
make
inquiries
concerning
a
prisoner
from
cherry
valley
whom
it
is
said
your
people
hold
at
this
moment
i
know
of
no
prisoner
in
our
encampment
brant
replied
stiffly
let
us
not
quibble
on
words
captain
whether
he
be
in
your
camp
here
or
at
oghkwaga
makes
no
difference
i
ask
if
you
will
tell
me
concerning
one
peter
sitz
who
but
a
few
days
since
when
lieutenant
wormwood
of
the
american
army
was
killed
in
ambush
your
people
made
a
prisoner
my
young
men
may
be
able
to
tell
you
somewhat
concerning
him
i
will
ask
them
and
will
you
as
a
favor
to
a
neighbor
and
an
old
friend
do
whatsoever
you
may
toward
releasing
the
unfortunate
man
general
herkimer
insisted
i
will
ask
my
young
men
was
all
the
reply
brant
would
make
and
then
the
powwow
was
brought
to
a
sudden
close
as
the
sachem
stalked
toward
the
encampment
followed
by
all
his
people
and
we
of
general
herkimer
party
were
left
alone
in
the
clearing
now
the
word
was
given
that
we
rejoin
the
main
body
quietly
and
in
double
file
with
no
man
straying
from
the
ranks
but
sergeant
corney
and
i
led
jacob
between
us
for
the
lad
was
frantic
with
grief
because
no
satisfaction
concerning
his
father
had
been
obtained
from
thayendanega
we
two
said
all
we
could
in
order
to
cheer
the
sorrowing
lad
and
that
all
was
little
neither
he
nor
we
nor
general
herkimer
himself
could
effect
anything
whatsoever
save
through
the
favor
of
the
mohawk
sachem
and
that
was
withheld
for
at
least
four
and
twenty
hours
with
the
chances
that
at
the
expiration
of
such
time
we
would
receive
nothing
better
from
the
wily
savage
than
a
refusal
to
answer
any
questions
i
shall
not
attempt
to
set
down
very
much
concerning
this
long
time
of
waiting
for
the
second
powwow
when
it
was
doubtful
if
we
would
be
allowed
to
leave
the
encampment
without
a
bloody
battle
even
general
herkimer
had
lost
all
hope
of
being
able
to
dissuade
joseph
brant
from
the
course
he
had
already
marked
out
for
himself
and
shared
with
his
men
the
suspicion
that
before
the
second
interview
was
come
to
an
end
we
would
be
the
victims
of
the
sachem
treachery
this
last
we
knew
from
the
information
which
was
whispered
about
the
encampment
to
the
effect
that
the
general
had
charged
one
of
the
soldiers
a
man
by
the
name
of
wagner
with
the
duty
of
selecting
two
others
that
the
three
might
stand
directly
behind
him
at
the
next
meeting
with
the
indians
and
at
the
first
show
of
hostilities
shoot
down
brant
and
the
two
sachems
next
him
in
authority
wagner
selected
george
and
abraham
herkimer
nephews
of
the
general
and
these
three
were
prepared
to
face
the
most
cruel
of
deaths
for
certain
it
was
that
if
they
were
obliged
to
make
an
attack
upon
the
mohawk
chieftain
every
indian
under
his
command
would
strive
most
earnestly
to
take
them
prisoners
in
order
that
they
be
made
to
suffer
death
by
torture
how
the
day
passed
i
hardly
know
the
soldiers
talked
among
themselves
in
whispers
as
men
do
in
the
presence
of
death
no
one
strayed
beyond
the
limits
of
the
encampment
but
all
waited
in
painful
suspense
for
that
hour
to
come
when
it
should
be
known
whether
joseph
brant
was
of
the
mind
that
we
might
return
to
our
homes
for
the
time
being
or
if
he
sought
immediately
to
compass
our
death
through
treachery
sergeant
corney
and
i
spent
our
time
in
trying
to
soothe
jacob
who
alternately
reproached
himself
for
remaining
idle
at
the
moment
when
he
should
be
straining
every
nerve
to
aid
his
father
and
relapsing
into
moody
silence
which
to
me
was
far
worse
than
the
angry
words
when
another
day
had
come
we
again
marched
into
the
clearing
the
three
who
had
been
selected
for
the
dangerous
duty
of
protecting
our
leader
in
case
of
an
outbreak
keeping
close
by
his
side
as
i
look
back
now
upon
what
was
afterward
done
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
that
peaceful
valley
of
ours
i
regret
most
sincerely
that
those
young
men
did
not
violate
the
unwritten
laws
and
usages
which
the
indians
themselves
were
ever
ready
to
cast
aside
when
it
suited
their
purpose
and
kill
the
bloodthirsty
brant
whether
his
men
showed
signs
of
enmity
or
not
on
this
occasion
we
had
not
long
to
wait
gathering
in
a
semicircle
behind
general
herkimer
as
before
we
were
hardly
in
position
when
thayendanega
clad
in
all
the
bravery
of
his
savage
garb
and
what
was
most
ominous
bedecked
in
strode
into
the
enclosure
followed
by
such
members
of
his
party
as
had
accompanied
him
the
day
previous
he
did
not
wait
for
greetings
but
began
boastfully
while
his
painted
fiends
were
yet
taking
their
places
by
saying
abruptly
i
have
five
hundred
warriors
with
me
armed
and
ready
for
battle
you
are
in
my
power
but
as
we
have
been
friends
and
neighbors
i
will
not
take
advantage
of
you
then
he
made
a
gesture
with
his
hand
and
on
the
instant
there
burst
from
amid
the
foliage
a
seemingly
endless
number
of
savages
all
painted
for
battle
who
coming
down
swiftly
upon
us
as
if
to
make
an
attack
uttered
wild
as
they
discharged
their
rifles
in
the
air
it
was
as
hideous
and
terrifying
a
sight
as
i
ever
witnessed
and
that
our
little
company
stood
its
ground
is
much
to
the
credit
of
every
man
among
us
thayendanega
remained
from
general
herkimer
and
within
two
feet
of
the
three
men
whose
duty
it
was
to
shoot
him
with
the
rifles
they
had
concealed
under
their
blankets
in
case
an
absolute
attack
was
made
and
there
watched
the
antics
of
his
painted
crew
until
perhaps
five
minutes
had
passed
when
the
savages
sank
down
upon
the
ground
as
if
exhausted
looking
like
so
many
images
of
demons
what
thayendanega
said
when
the
uproar
was
thus
stilled
i
can
not
rightly
set
down
for
my
brain
was
in
such
a
whirl
and
fear
so
strong
in
my
heart
as
to
prevent
me
from
taking
due
heed
of
all
that
was
passing
i
realized
only
that
death
was
literally
staring
us
in
the
face
as
sergeant
corney
afterward
told
me
brant
advised
general
herkimer
to
go
home
thanked
him
for
having
come
to
pay
the
visit
and
said
that
at
some
near
day
he
might
return
the
compliment
but
the
prisoner
general
herkimer
cried
when
the
sachem
would
have
stalked
away
with
a
great
assumption
of
dignity
my
young
men
will
make
no
reply
to
my
questions
brant
answered
unblushingly
although
he
must
have
known
beyond
a
peradventure
that
we
understood
full
well
he
was
lying
is
peter
sitz
yet
alive
general
herkimer
asked
sternly
there
has
been
no
prisoner
put
to
death
by
my
people
since
they
left
cherry
valley
thayendanega
replied
as
if
irritated
by
the
persistence
and
making
another
gesture
with
his
hand
he
sent
back
into
the
cover
of
the
forest
all
his
motley
crew
then
he
also
walked
away
as
if
fearing
our
commander
would
detain
him
with
yet
further
questions
and
the
powwow
to
take
part
in
which
three
hundred
men
had
marched
so
many
miles
was
come
to
an
end
without
other
result
than
the
knowledge
that
the
mohawk
chief
would
harry
us
of
the
valley
to
the
best
of
his
wicked
powers
thayendanega
had
hardly
gained
the
shelter
of
the
thicket
before
black
clouds
overspread
the
heavens
and
it
seemed
as
if
in
a
twinkling
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
sharp
flashes
of
lightning
zigzagged
across
the
sky
and
more
than
one
around
me
declared
it
was
a
portent
a
sign
a
token
of
the
tempest
which
was
about
to
break
upon
our
peaceful
homes
when
we
were
in
camp
once
more
and
general
herkimer
was
making
his
preparations
to
set
off
on
the
return
march
jacob
declared
that
he
alone
if
we
did
not
accompany
him
would
go
into
the
indian
village
and
there
make
inquiries
for
his
father
sergeant
corney
and
i
spent
a
long
hour
persuading
the
lad
of
his
folly
for
after
the
powwow
had
come
to
such
an
abrupt
end
there
was
no
question
whatsoever
but
that
thayendanega
would
kill
or
make
prisoner
of
every
white
man
who
crossed
his
path
for
a
time
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
we
two
hold
jacob
by
force
to
prevent
him
from
leaving
us
and
then
gradually
the
boy
came
to
understand
that
for
his
father
life
he
could
only
hope
in
the
mercy
of
god
since
even
had
general
herkimer
been
willing
to
risk
a
battle
in
which
he
would
have
been
greatly
outnumbered
by
the
savages
there
was
no
hope
he
might
effect
the
release
of
peter
sitz
sergeant
corney
had
an
interview
with
the
general
after
we
had
succeeded
in
quieting
jacob
to
a
certain
degree
and
the
commander
advised
that
we
return
home
without
delay
in
order
to
give
information
as
to
what
we
had
seen
but
he
did
us
three
the
honor
of
requesting
in
case
our
services
should
not
be
needed
immediately
at
cherry
valley
that
we
would
rejoin
his
force
which
was
to
be
stationed
at
the
mouth
of
oriskany
creek
without
delay
he
promised
that
we
should
have
every
opportunity
of
serving
the
patriot
cause
and
in
order
that
we
might
be
allowed
to
leave
cherry
valley
again
he
sent
a
written
message
to
my
uncle
of
the
purport
of
which
i
was
then
ignorant
we
meaning
sergeant
corney
jacob
and
myself
set
off
as
soon
as
the
conference
with
general
herkimer
was
at
an
end
on
the
long
journey
to
our
homes
knowing
that
the
advance
must
be
slow
and
cautious
for
we
had
heard
from
thayendanega
own
lips
that
he
was
fully
committed
to
the
work
of
harrying
the
patriots
as
i
look
back
upon
it
now
i
wonder
that
we
succeeded
in
traversing
the
wilderness
when
brant
force
was
so
near
at
hand
without
mishap
but
as
it
proved
we
had
more
difficulty
in
persuading
jacob
to
accompany
us
than
in
eluding
the
foe
whom
we
believed
might
spring
upon
us
at
any
moment
and
when
we
arrived
home
it
was
to
learn
that
the
danger
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
mohawk
valley
was
more
imminent
even
than
when
thayendanega
stalked
away
from
the
interview
with
general
herkimer
and
this
was
the
situation
as
i
afterward
read
it
in
printed
letters
a
few
days
after
this
conference
with
general
herkimer
brant
withdrew
his
warriors
from
the
susquehanna
and
joined
sir
john
johnson
and
john
butler
who
were
collecting
a
large
body
of
tories
and
refugees
at
oswego
preparatory
to
a
descent
upon
the
mohawk
and
schoharie
settlements
there
guy
johnson
and
other
officers
of
the
british
indian
department
summoned
a
grand
council
of
the
six
nations
they
were
invited
to
assemble
to
the
flesh
and
drink
the
blood
of
a
bostonian
in
other
words
to
feast
on
the
occasion
of
a
proposed
treaty
of
alliance
against
the
patriots
whom
the
savages
denominated
for
the
reason
that
boston
was
the
focus
of
the
rebellion
there
was
a
pretty
full
attendance
at
the
council
but
a
large
portion
of
the
sachems
adhered
faithfully
to
their
covenant
of
neutrality
made
with
general
schuyler
until
the
appeals
of
the
british
commissioners
to
their
avarice
overcame
their
sense
of
honor
the
commissioners
represented
the
people
of
the
king
to
be
numerous
as
the
forest
leaves
and
rich
in
every
possession
while
those
of
the
colonies
were
exhibited
as
few
and
poor
that
the
armies
of
the
king
would
soon
subdue
the
rebels
and
make
them
still
weaker
and
poorer
that
the
rum
of
the
king
was
as
abundant
as
the
waters
of
lake
ontario
and
that
if
the
indians
would
become
his
allies
during
the
war
they
should
never
want
for
goods
or
money
tawdry
articles
such
as
scarlet
cloths
beads
and
trinkets
were
then
displayed
and
presented
to
the
indians
which
pleased
them
greatly
and
they
concluded
an
alliance
by
binding
themselves
to
take
up
the
hatchet
against
the
patriots
and
to
continue
their
warfare
until
the
latter
were
subdued
to
each
indian
were
then
presented
a
brass
kettle
a
suit
of
clothes
a
gun
a
tomahawk
and
a
piece
of
gold
a
quantity
of
ammunition
and
a
promise
of
a
bounty
upon
every
scalp
he
should
bring
in
thayendanega
was
thenceforth
the
acknowledged
grand
sachem
of
the
six
nations
and
at
once
commenced
his
terrible
career
in
the
midst
of
our
border
settlements
i
had
no
more
than
time
to
tell
my
mother
what
i
had
seen
when
my
comrades
were
ready
to
set
out
for
oriskany
creek
counting
to
make
their
way
over
much
the
same
ground
we
had
just
traversed
my
uncle
colonel
campbell
gave
his
consent
to
our
departure
after
reading
general
herkimer
message
and
congratulated
me
who
deserved
no
praise
because
i
had
succeeded
in
so
far
winning
the
confidence
of
a
thorough
soldier
that
he
should
make
a
personal
request
for
the
services
of
myself
and
my
companions
it
was
not
in
our
minds
that
we
would
remain
very
long
with
our
new
commander
sergeant
corney
believed
general
herkimer
had
some
especial
matter
in
hand
in
which
he
thought
we
three
might
be
of
particular
service
and
when
that
was
done
we
would
be
allowed
to
return
home
therefore
it
was
that
we
still
counted
ourselves
minute
boys
of
the
mohawk
valley
and
left
our
company
in
charge
of
john
sammons
who
was
to
act
in
my
stead
until
i
came
back
it
pleased
jacob
that
we
were
to
return
to
that
portion
of
the
country
where
we
would
be
near
brant
forces
for
he
still
cherished
the
hope
of
being
able
to
aid
in
the
rescuing
of
his
father
if
peradventure
peter
sitz
yet
remained
in
this
world
our
stay
in
cherry
valley
was
of
no
more
than
two
hours
duration
but
we
learned
much
concerning
the
war
in
that
time
our
little
settlement
seemed
overrun
with
people
because
of
the
soldiers
quartered
there
regarding
whom
i
have
already
written
and
the
inhabitants
from
miles
around
who
had
come
to
find
a
place
of
refuge
already
had
word
been
brought
in
that
there
were
then
gathered
at
oswego
seven
hundred
indians
and
four
hundred
british
soldiers
under
command
of
sir
john
johnson
and
colonel
claus
and
at
oswegatchie
or
as
it
is
now
called
ogdensburg
were
six
hundred
tories
ready
to
join
johnson
force
all
that
stood
between
these
enemies
and
the
broad
bosom
of
the
mohawk
valley
was
fort
dayton
that
poor
apology
for
a
defence
and
fort
schuyler
not
yet
completely
built
and
illy
manned
that
this
last
named
fortification
could
withstand
an
assault
by
such
an
army
as
sir
john
was
evidently
making
ready
to
bring
against
it
few
believed
and
all
with
whom
i
talked
during
the
short
time
of
our
stay
at
home
were
looking
forward
to
the
future
with
the
gravest
fears
and
keenest
anxiety
when
already
weary
and
footsore
we
took
up
our
line
of
march
to
traverse
the
same
paths
over
which
we
had
just
come
my
company
of
minute
boys
insisted
on
accompanying
us
during
the
first
miles
of
the
tedious
journey
but
it
was
not
in
triumph
or
rejoicing
that
we
all
lads
of
cherry
valley
left
the
little
settlement
our
elders
were
disheartened
and
afraid
therefore
we
could
well
be
excused
for
gloomy
looks
and
timid
whisperings
as
we
spoke
of
what
might
take
place
before
i
was
able
to
resume
command
of
the
company
which
sergeant
corney
had
spent
so
many
hours
in
drilling
when
the
afternoon
was
spent
and
we
had
come
to
a
halt
that
we
might
take
leave
of
our
escort
sergeant
corney
seemed
to
think
it
necessary
he
should
do
what
he
might
toward
putting
courage
into
the
hearts
of
those
who
had
accompanied
us
by
saying
as
if
haranguing
a
full
army
you
lads
are
looked
upon
in
the
settlement
only
as
boys
and
yet
already
have
two
of
your
number
shown
that
they
could
stand
steady
facing
the
gravest
danger
without
flinching
now
is
the
time
when
you
may
prove
yourselves
men
as
i
believe
you
are
in
courage
and
ability
if
you
are
called
upon
to
confront
the
enemy
remember
that
there
is
nothing
more
glorious
than
to
die
in
defence
of
your
homes
and
your
country
there
is
no
way
by
which
you
can
earn
more
honor
than
to
have
it
said
of
you
gave
up
his
life
for
those
he
loved
better
be
shot
down
at
the
opening
of
an
action
than
to
live
through
it
in
such
a
manner
that
your
neighbors
can
point
the
finger
of
scorn
at
you
saying
goes
a
coward
the
old
man
ceased
speaking
abruptly
turned
about
without
word
or
sign
and
plunged
into
the
thicket
jacob
and
i
following
close
at
his
heels
chapter
iv
on
the
oriskany
as
we
three
plodded
wearily
on
day
after
day
all
our
senses
quickened
by
knowledge
of
the
many
dangers
with
which
we
were
surrounded
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
had
begun
our
work
in
behalf
of
the
cause
backward
as
if
this
going
to
and
fro
over
the
same
ground
was
a
wilful
waste
of
time
when
every
hour
was
so
precious
i
said
to
myself
again
and
again
that
if
general
herkimer
really
needed
such
services
as
we
could
render
it
would
have
been
better
had
we
remained
with
him
rather
than
spend
so
many
days
and
be
forced
to
such
severe
labor
as
was
required
for
the
march
to
cherry
valley
and
back
we
had
accomplished
nothing
of
importance
by
going
home
colonel
campbell
knew
even
more
regarding
brant
movements
than
we
could
tell
him
and
it
was
by
no
means
necessary
he
should
be
informed
immediately
as
to
the
result
of
general
herkimer
interview
with
the
mohawk
sachem
as
the
days
passed
and
our
every
effort
was
needed
to
enable
us
to
advance
without
absolutely
running
into
the
arms
of
the
savages
for
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
everywhere
in
the
wilderness
jacob
became
more
resigned
or
so
it
appeared
since
he
ceased
to
insist
that
this
or
that
impracticable
move
be
made
i
did
not
suppose
he
no
longer
mourned
for
his
father
but
believed
and
hoped
he
had
come
to
understand
we
could
not
do
anything
toward
effecting
a
rescue
until
all
the
circumstances
were
favorable
one
day
march
was
much
like
another
and
many
passed
before
we
were
with
general
herkimer
again
we
always
camped
in
a
thicket
taking
good
care
not
to
leave
a
trail
leading
up
to
the
place
and
in
this
last
task
we
did
not
consider
the
time
spent
as
wasted
for
on
every
hand
could
be
seen
signs
of
the
enemy
therefore
the
utmost
precaution
was
needed
all
of
us
gave
ourselves
over
to
slumber
as
soon
as
we
were
stretched
out
on
the
ground
for
however
careful
a
watch
might
have
been
kept
it
would
not
have
availed
if
the
enemy
was
bent
on
surprising
us
in
the
early
light
of
the
new
day
either
jacob
or
i
went
out
in
search
of
small
game
for
it
goes
without
saying
that
we
could
not
have
brought
from
home
a
sufficient
amount
of
food
to
sustain
us
during
all
the
time
we
spent
roaming
to
and
fro
between
cherry
valley
and
the
oriskany
if
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
get
so
much
meat
as
would
serve
for
one
or
more
meals
we
cooked
it
by
digging
a
hole
in
the
ground
building
therein
a
fire
and
screening
the
smoke
as
best
we
might
with
boughs
and
ferns
that
done
we
satisfied
our
hunger
while
creeping
slowly
onward
oftentimes
forced
to
spend
an
hour
or
more
in
making
a
détour
around
some
particularly
dangerous
locality
if
as
often
happened
we
failed
of
finding
game
we
buckled
our
belts
the
tighter
and
went
on
consoling
ourselves
with
the
hope
that
fortune
would
favor
us
before
nightfall
more
than
once
would
we
have
run
upon
a
party
of
savages
scouts
or
hunters
had
it
not
been
for
the
almost
excessive
precautions
sergeant
corney
insisted
on
taking
and
in
such
case
there
was
no
other
course
than
to
hide
as
best
we
might
and
wait
until
the
enemy
was
pleased
to
move
on
fortunately
we
did
not
come
face
to
face
with
the
redskins
therefore
a
detailed
story
of
our
march
would
be
dull
reading
for
it
could
only
be
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
until
the
hour
arrived
when
we
entered
general
herkimer
camp
on
the
oriskany
receiving
there
such
a
greeting
from
the
commander
himself
as
caused
me
to
believe
he
really
needed
us
for
some
important
task
you
have
done
well
to
get
back
alive
he
cried
with
a
laugh
it
is
pleasing
to
know
that
lads
can
do
what
many
of
their
elders
would
balk
at
so
colonel
campbell
was
willing
to
give
you
up
to
me
illustration
have
done
well
to
get
back
alive
he
made
no
protest
sir
i
replied
after
waiting
an
instant
for
one
of
my
companions
to
act
the
part
of
spokesman
an
hundred
and
fifty
soldiers
are
quartered
at
cherry
valley
and
they
with
the
many
who
have
made
of
the
settlement
a
place
of
refuge
are
in
such
numbers
that
three
would
neither
be
needed
or
missed
that
would
depend
on
what
stuff
the
three
were
made
according
to
my
way
of
thinking
i
have
some
work
here
which
you
can
do
better
than
any
one
else
of
whom
i
know
and
the
only
question
is
whether
you
are
willing
to
lay
your
shoulders
to
the
wheel
when
there
a
good
bit
of
danger
in
so
doing
we
have
come
sir
to
do
whatsoever
offered
an
if
the
task
which
you
have
in
mind
could
be
performed
with
safety
then
we
might
as
well
have
stayed
at
home
i
replied
and
sergeant
corney
nodded
to
show
that
we
were
of
one
mind
since
i
last
saw
you
the
enemy
has
gathered
in
strong
force
about
fort
schuyler
and
it
is
necessary
we
get
some
word
to
the
commandant
who
is
in
fact
besieged
that
should
be
sich
a
terrible
hard
job
sir
sergeant
corney
said
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
we
were
received
by
the
general
true
for
you
but
the
reason
why
i
have
sent
any
of
my
own
men
before
this
is
that
if
the
messenger
should
be
discovered
while
trying
to
get
inside
joseph
brant
would
know
for
a
certainty
that
we
on
the
outside
believed
the
garrison
to
be
hard
pressed
which
would
probably
work
no
end
of
mischief
for
at
present
the
enemy
has
every
reason
to
suppose
colonel
gansevoort
has
all
the
men
and
stores
he
can
possibly
need
why
should
he
think
differently
if
one
of
us
was
captured
while
tryin
to
communicate
with
the
besieged
sir
sergeant
corney
asked
curiously
because
you
have
every
reason
for
going
there
even
though
you
had
never
heard
that
the
fort
was
invested
i
could
not
repress
a
look
of
surprise
for
it
was
much
as
if
the
general
was
speaking
in
riddles
and
seeing
the
question
on
my
face
he
continued
it
is
only
natural
that
you
from
cherry
valley
should
be
searching
for
peter
sitz
and
the
indians
in
case
you
were
captured
would
perforce
believe
such
a
story
is
my
father
in
their
camp
sir
jacob
cried
eagerly
ay
lad
so
i
believe
otherwise
i
would
not
think
it
important
you
should
act
as
my
messengers
one
of
our
scouts
brought
in
word
that
brant
immediate
followers
had
a
white
prisoner
with
them
and
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
him
to
be
peter
sitz
for
since
we
saw
those
scoundrels
they
have
kept
out
of
mischief
because
of
being
in
camp
with
the
british
and
tory
soldiers
there
was
no
need
now
of
urging
jacob
to
undertake
the
mission
since
he
had
what
seemed
like
positive
information
of
his
father
whereabouts
he
would
have
gone
in
the
direction
of
the
besieged
fort
whether
general
herkimer
so
desired
or
opposed
it
as
for
my
part
having
really
given
up
all
hope
of
seeing
peter
sitz
again
in
this
world
the
probable
fact
of
his
being
alive
quickened
the
blood
in
my
veins
until
i
forgot
that
our
services
were
required
for
anything
save
the
rescue
of
the
prisoner
sergeant
corney
gave
no
token
either
of
joy
or
indifference
he
kept
in
mind
only
the
duties
of
a
soldier
and
prepared
himself
for
the
dangerous
mission
by
asking
can
you
tell
me
sir
what
force
the
enemy
have
in
front
of
fort
schuyler
near
one
thousand
seven
hundred
men
regulars
tories
and
indians
leger
is
in
nominal
command
but
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
sir
john
johnson
and
brant
have
much
the
same
authority
as
he
certain
it
is
that
they
and
none
other
can
control
their
followers
colonel
gansevoort
has
nearly
a
thousand
men
with
a
six
weeks
supply
of
provisions
and
ammunition
for
the
small
arms
but
there
is
in
the
fort
no
more
than
four
hundred
rounds
for
the
cannon
which
is
his
most
important
means
of
defence
the
situation
is
not
yet
critical
but
may
become
so
very
soon
and
we
have
more
chance
now
for
communicating
with
the
commandant
than
is
likely
to
be
the
case
a
week
hence
when
the
besiegers
have
settled
down
to
their
work
when
shall
we
set
out
sir
i
asked
as
the
general
ceased
speaking
as
soon
as
you
have
recovered
from
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
unless
you
are
eager
to
encounter
more
danger
than
is
absolutely
necessary
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
set
off
at
once
jacob
said
quickly
we
are
not
women
to
be
tired
out
by
a
bit
of
marchin
i
fancied
from
the
expression
on
the
general
face
that
it
pleased
him
because
my
comrade
showed
himself
so
eager
and
there
was
a
tinge
of
bitterness
in
my
heart
as
i
understood
that
whatever
good
to
the
cause
might
be
the
purpose
of
our
task
the
commander
was
in
a
certain
degree
trading
on
jacob
love
for
his
father
it
was
not
for
me
however
to
criticize
even
in
my
own
mind
anything
of
a
military
nature
which
might
be
on
foot
i
had
had
ample
time
since
the
powwow
with
thayendanega
to
decide
whether
or
no
i
would
serve
under
general
herkimer
and
having
come
to
a
decision
it
stood
me
in
hand
to
do
whatsoever
lay
before
me
without
question
i
held
much
the
same
opinion
as
did
jacob
however
although
not
because
of
the
same
reason
it
seemed
to
me
a
most
dangerous
undertaking
this
attempt
to
get
a
message
into
a
fort
which
was
besieged
by
so
large
a
body
of
men
but
since
it
must
be
done
unless
we
were
willing
to
show
the
white
feather
then
i
was
eager
to
be
at
it
for
danger
appears
greater
when
one
stands
idly
by
looking
at
it
from
the
distance
than
when
it
is
actually
encountered
sergeant
corney
who
had
evidently
been
turning
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
said
after
a
time
to
the
commander
it
strikes
me
sir
that
we
should
get
all
the
information
we
may
concernin
the
whereabouts
of
the
enemy
before
settin
out
not
that
i
am
askin
for
any
long
delay
he
added
quickly
observing
a
faint
expression
of
displeasure
on
the
general
face
i
would
mingle
among
the
men
to
learn
what
they
may
know
from
now
until
sunset
when
as
it
seems
to
me
our
journey
had
best
be
begun
by
startin
at
that
time
we
shall
arrive
before
sunrise
an
thus
have
all
the
day
in
which
to
lay
our
plans
for
approachin
the
fort
jacob
eyes
twinkled
with
satisfaction
when
he
heard
this
proposition
and
i
believed
he
was
thinking
that
if
we
lay
in
hiding
a
full
day
in
front
of
the
fortification
he
might
have
opportunity
to
learn
something
concerning
his
father
i
shall
leave
to
you
who
are
most
deeply
concerned
in
the
matter
the
method
of
doing
the
work
pick
up
all
the
information
you
can
and
when
you
are
ready
to
set
out
come
to
me
for
the
final
instructions
then
the
commander
as
if
to
show
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
and
sergeant
corney
beckoned
jacob
and
me
to
follow
him
reminding
us
when
we
were
comparatively
alone
of
the
promise
made
at
the
time
we
first
set
out
the
day
we
left
cherry
valley
on
brant
trail
you
lads
agreed
to
follow
me
without
questionin
even
when
it
seemed
as
if
i
might
be
goin
wrong
an
now
has
come
the
time
for
you
to
keep
that
well
in
mind
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
do
so
i
replied
promptly
i
doubt
not
but
that
you
who
are
versed
in
military
matters
could
direct
such
a
task
better
than
any
in
this
encampment
i
not
takin
that
much
praise
to
myself
lad
but
do
claim
because
of
havin
had
more
experience
to
be
better
fitted
for
the
work
after
we
are
once
arrived
than
are
you
i
will
go
even
so
far
as
to
say
that
on
the
trail
or
in
the
thicket
you
are
my
superiors
owin
to
havin
been
brought
up
to
work
which
except
in
this
country
would
be
considered
almost
unsoldierly
here
is
my
first
order
mingle
with
the
men
of
this
encampment
with
the
idea
of
fillin
your
stomachs
with
food
an
that
done
lie
down
to
sleep
until
i
shall
summon
you
sleep
jacob
exclaimed
angrily
think
you
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
sleep
now
when
we
know
that
the
moment
has
come
in
which
i
may
be
able
to
aid
my
father
ay
lad
but
you
must
whether
you
will
or
no
you
can
work
for
him
best
by
preparin
your
body
for
whatsoever
of
fatigue
we
may
be
called
upon
to
undergo
an
since
there
is
little
chance
we
shall
gain
any
rest
four
an
twenty
hours
after
leavin
here
it
stands
us
all
in
hand
to
be
prepared
for
the
exertion
are
you
countin
on
sleepin
jacob
asked
fiercely
i
am
more
accustomed
to
keepin
my
eyes
open
durin
a
long
time
than
are
you
but
if
it
so
be
i
have
the
chance
you
may
be
certain
i
shall
take
advantage
of
it
now
remember
eat
an
sleep
until
i
seek
you
out
then
the
old
man
left
us
and
watching
for
a
moment
we
saw
him
enter
into
conversation
with
this
soldier
and
that
until
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
bent
on
making
the
acquaintance
of
every
member
of
the
force
jacob
and
i
had
little
difficulty
in
finding
as
much
food
as
we
needed
after
having
explained
why
we
had
come
into
the
encampment
the
men
were
more
than
willing
to
divide
their
rations
with
us
and
we
might
literally
have
gorged
ourselves
with
the
best
in
the
camp
had
such
been
our
desire
it
was
one
thing
for
sergeant
corney
to
say
that
we
must
sleep
and
quite
another
for
us
to
obey
the
command
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
eyes
were
never
open
wider
than
when
i
threw
myself
down
upon
the
ground
by
the
side
of
jacob
striving
my
best
to
cross
over
into
dreamland
the
thought
of
attempting
to
force
our
way
through
such
an
army
as
general
leger
had
under
his
command
of
the
possibility
that
we
might
perhaps
come
across
peter
sitz
the
chances
that
colonel
gansevoort
would
be
forced
to
surrender
even
before
we
could
arrive
with
information
that
reinforcements
were
near
at
hand
and
in
fact
the
numberless
happenings
which
might
occur
to
change
the
entire
situation
served
to
drive
sleep
so
far
from
my
eyelids
that
i
despaired
of
being
able
to
summon
it
until
sheer
exhaustion
should
come
jacob
was
lying
with
closed
eyes
so
still
that
i
he
had
succeeded
in
obeying
sergeant
corney
commands
and
bent
on
moving
around
among
the
men
in
the
hope
of
thereby
changing
the
current
of
my
disagreeable
thoughts
i
crept
softly
from
his
side
lest
i
awaken
him
where
are
you
goin
he
asked
quietly
in
a
tone
which
told
me
he
had
been
no
nearer
slumber
than
i
i
can
not
sleep
an
that
a
fact
perhaps
after
walkin
around
a
bit
i
shall
feel
more
like
it
i
go
with
you
jacob
said
rising
to
his
feet
there
is
no
hope
i
can
sleep
although
i
am
willin
if
needs
be
to
make
it
appear
as
if
i
was
unconscious
taking
heed
not
to
go
near
sergeant
corney
whom
we
could
see
in
the
distance
jacob
went
from
one
group
of
soldiers
to
the
other
and
as
may
be
supposed
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
everywhere
was
the
possibility
that
fort
schuyler
could
hold
out
against
the
large
number
of
men
who
were
besieging
it
as
well
as
the
chances
of
general
command
being
able
to
enter
the
place
thus
it
was
we
learned
that
among
brant
following
were
savages
from
all
the
various
tribes
of
the
six
nations
except
the
oneidas
who
remained
faithful
to
their
agreement
to
be
neutral
during
the
war
it
was
said
that
the
besiegers
were
well
supplied
with
everything
necessary
for
the
accomplishment
of
their
purpose
including
a
large
amount
of
ready
money
and
general
leger
was
willing
to
pay
liberally
for
the
services
of
those
who
would
join
him
it
was
also
reported
the
information
having
been
brought
in
by
scouts
that
on
the
second
day
of
the
siege
the
british
commander
had
sent
to
the
fort
a
messenger
who
with
many
words
recited
the
love
of
the
king
for
those
who
remained
loyal
to
him
and
the
punishment
which
would
be
inflicted
upon
those
who
continued
in
rebellion
this
stream
of
bombast
was
concluded
by
direst
threats
in
case
the
garrison
held
out
against
the
demand
for
surrender
the
sum
and
substance
of
which
was
that
the
savages
would
be
allowed
to
commit
every
act
of
barbarity
their
ingenuity
could
devise
if
an
assault
should
become
necessary
nearly
all
the
defenders
of
the
fort
laughed
these
threats
and
promises
to
scorn
and
it
was
believed
that
gansevoort
men
would
hold
out
to
the
bitter
end
we
heard
very
much
in
addition
which
was
really
no
more
than
camp
gossip
and
it
is
not
necessary
i
set
it
down
here
before
the
close
of
the
day
both
jacob
and
i
really
succeeded
in
going
to
sleep
and
the
shadows
of
night
were
beginning
to
lengthen
when
we
were
aroused
by
sergeant
corney
i
reckon
i
heard
all
that
the
men
in
camp
have
to
tell
he
said
when
i
stood
upright
in
obedience
to
the
pressure
of
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
it
only
remains
to
get
our
instructions
from
general
herkimer
before
makin
the
attempt
to
have
speech
with
those
in
the
fort
have
you
seen
him
yet
i
asked
in
surprise
for
it
had
been
in
my
mind
that
the
old
man
would
make
every
preparation
before
summoning
us
no
lad
this
is
a
venture
in
which
we
share
the
dangers
equally
it
no
more
than
right
you
should
hear
all
which
may
pass
between
the
general
an
me
therefore
let
us
bring
the
business
to
an
end
as
speedily
as
may
be
well
we
presented
ourselves
before
the
commander
announcing
that
the
time
had
come
when
we
were
to
leave
camp
and
considering
all
the
risks
which
were
to
be
run
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
message
he
would
have
delivered
was
exceeding
brief
and
unimportant
as
compared
with
what
might
result
from
the
attempt
at
delivery
i
shall
not
give
you
a
written
message
lest
you
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
he
said
speaking
in
a
kindly
tone
and
looking
at
us
as
i
fancied
pityingly
much
as
one
would
at
those
who
had
been
selected
as
sacrifices
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
necessary
you
get
speech
with
colonel
gansevoort
and
to
such
end
make
disposal
of
yourselves
so
that
should
one
or
even
two
be
taken
or
killed
the
second
or
third
may
press
on
having
arrived
say
to
the
commandant
that
i
shall
leave
this
camp
morning
marching
slowly
toward
the
fort
and
immediately
after
he
has
received
the
information
he
is
to
fire
three
cannon
in
rapid
succession
thus
notifying
me
that
he
understands
the
situation
you
will
not
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
finish
the
journey
in
less
than
four
and
twenty
hours
and
by
that
time
i
shall
be
where
the
reports
of
the
guns
can
be
heard
once
the
signal
has
been
given
it
is
my
purpose
to
attack
the
enemy
and
colonel
gansevoort
is
to
make
a
sortie
at
the
same
time
when
it
is
to
be
hoped
our
forces
can
be
united
having
said
this
the
general
insisted
that
each
of
us
repeat
the
instructions
so
that
he
might
know
we
understood
them
thoroughly
and
then
clasping
us
by
hand
in
turn
he
bade
us
godspeed
i
wish
i
might
be
able
to
say
that
my
heart
was
stout
when
we
left
the
encampment
and
were
swallowed
up
by
the
shadows
of
the
thicket
but
such
was
not
the
case
i
realized
only
too
well
all
the
dangers
which
were
before
us
and
the
odds
against
our
being
able
to
obey
the
general
orders
at
the
same
time
i
knew
that
in
event
of
failure
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
retreat
but
we
would
find
ourselves
in
the
hands
of
an
enemy
whose
greatest
delight
consists
in
the
most
fiendish
murder
as
i
figured
it
out
of
a
hundred
chances
we
had
no
more
than
one
of
getting
into
the
fort
and
there
remained
ninety
and
nine
in
favor
of
our
falling
victims
to
brant
crew
we
had
but
just
set
out
when
i
observed
that
sergeant
corney
had
left
behind
him
every
superfluous
article
of
clothing
and
all
accoutrements
save
the
knife
in
his
belt
whereupon
i
asked
the
reason
for
thus
laying
himself
bare
to
the
enemy
you
lads
have
each
a
rifle
which
are
all
the
weapons
we
need
for
it
can
avail
us
nothing
to
make
a
fight
if
we
win
it
must
be
by
strategy
not
force
and
in
case
of
success
it
will
be
a
small
matter
to
provide
ourselves
with
other
arms
at
the
same
time
it
gives
me
courage
to
know
that
i
have
something
with
which
to
defend
myself
jacob
said
with
a
laugh
which
had
in
it
nothing
of
mirth
ay
lad
so
i
counted
otherwise
i
had
advised
that
you
follow
my
example
it
can
do
no
harm
to
take
whatsoever
you
will
for
that
which
hinders
may
readily
be
cast
aside
now
let
us
come
to
an
end
of
for
silence
is
our
safest
ally
as
the
old
man
had
said
either
jacob
or
i
should
have
known
more
of
woodcraft
than
did
he
but
on
this
night
i
dare
venture
to
assert
that
there
were
not
above
a
dozen
in
joseph
brant
following
who
could
have
made
their
way
through
the
thicket
with
less
noise
and
in
a
more
direct
course
than
did
he
from
general
herkimer
encampment
in
an
through
the
forest
to
fort
schuyler
was
not
more
than
seven
or
eight
miles
and
despite
our
slow
progress
for
one
can
not
travel
rapidly
when
striving
to
advance
without
so
much
as
the
breaking
of
a
twig
we
counted
on
arriving
in
front
of
the
enemy
lines
by
midnight
and
this
i
believe
we
did
the
first
intimation
we
had
that
our
journey
was
approaching
a
close
came
when
we
suddenly
saw
directly
in
our
line
of
advance
a
faint
light
amid
the
thicket
in
the
distance
and
sergeant
corney
who
had
been
leading
the
way
halted
quickly
you
lads
are
to
remain
here
while
i
find
out
what
portion
of
force
is
in
front
of
us
he
said
in
a
whisper
and
then
it
was
that
i
ventured
to
dispute
his
authority
having
as
i
believed
good
reason
for
so
doing
you
yourself
have
admitted
that
either
jacob
or
i
could
beat
you
out
at
work
of
this
kind
let
me
go
an
do
you
stay
here
then
it
was
that
jacob
insisted
on
performing
the
most
dangerous
portion
of
the
work
and
would
have
passed
by
me
in
the
darkness
to
avoid
a
controversy
but
that
i
clutched
him
by
the
arm
and
sergeant
corney
whispered
you
lads
shall
lead
the
way
and
i
will
follow
at
your
heels
but
remember
what
general
herkimer
impressed
upon
us
that
one
get
through
therefore
if
he
who
leads
is
captured
the
other
two
shall
leave
him
to
his
fate
for
the
life
of
a
single
human
being
is
not
to
be
counted
when
we
are
tryin
to
save
hundreds
it
was
not
a
time
nor
a
place
for
argument
and
in
token
of
agreement
with
him
i
took
up
the
lead
i
did
not
attempt
to
go
forward
rapidly
but
upon
the
ground
i
crept
onward
inch
by
inch
removing
carefully
with
my
hands
every
twig
or
dry
leaf
which
might
be
in
the
path
lest
by
the
lightest
rustling
of
the
branches
i
give
warning
to
the
enemy
of
our
approach
in
such
manner
it
was
not
possible
to
make
other
than
slow
progress
and
i
believe
fully
half
an
hour
was
spent
in
traversing
the
distance
of
a
dozen
yards
when
we
were
come
to
where
could
be
had
a
view
of
that
which
had
attracted
our
attention
nine
indians
were
lounging
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
river
that
we
knew
to
be
the
mohawk
around
a
small
fire
over
which
were
being
cooked
slices
of
fresh
meat
they
were
talking
earnestly
among
themselves
meanwhile
for
these
red
sneaks
of
the
forest
do
not
when
alone
maintain
that
silent
dignity
with
which
so
many
writers
ignorant
of
their
customs
try
to
invest
them
they
were
members
of
brant
own
tribe
as
i
knew
from
the
language
with
which
i
was
reasonably
familiar
and
after
a
few
moments
it
was
possible
to
gather
from
the
conversation
that
leger
had
interfered
in
some
way
with
their
plans
or
thwarted
their
desires
the
stream
was
not
so
wide
at
this
point
but
that
we
could
hear
fairly
well
what
they
said
it
seemed
necessary
i
should
learn
all
i
might
before
we
crept
past
the
small
encampment
and
never
dreaming
how
much
of
anguish
the
listening
might
cause
my
comrade
i
remained
silent
and
motionless
until
enough
had
been
said
to
convince
me
that
their
grievance
consisted
in
the
fact
that
they
had
not
been
allowed
to
indulge
in
the
amusement
of
torturing
a
prisoner
during
that
same
evening
then
it
flashed
upon
me
that
it
was
peter
sitz
of
whom
they
spoke
and
involuntarily
i
moved
backward
the
one
thought
in
my
mind
being
to
prevent
jacob
from
hearing
but
the
vigor
with
which
he
clutched
me
by
the
leg
told
that
it
was
too
late
the
lad
had
heard
as
much
as
i
and
to
his
mind
the
prisoner
spoken
of
could
be
none
other
than
his
father
for
a
moment
i
ceased
my
efforts
at
retreat
and
then
realizing
that
if
we
would
take
jacob
with
us
to
the
completion
of
general
commands
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
hear
anything
more
i
would
have
backed
away
rapidly
to
my
dismay
and
sorrow
however
he
held
me
as
if
in
a
grip
of
iron
and
despite
all
silent
efforts
on
my
part
i
was
forced
to
remain
chapter
divided
duty
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
blame
jacob
for
being
eager
to
learn
all
he
could
regarding
his
father
and
it
certainly
seemed
as
if
we
might
hear
that
which
would
at
least
tell
us
who
this
prisoner
was
that
they
were
so
keen
to
torture
but
surely
we
were
not
warranted
in
lingering
for
the
possible
saving
of
one
human
life
when
by
our
delay
hundreds
might
be
placed
in
gravest
danger
however
i
could
not
retreat
because
jacob
held
me
firmly
in
his
clutch
from
which
i
would
have
been
unable
to
release
myself
save
at
the
cost
of
betraying
our
whereabouts
with
the
hope
that
the
lad
might
soon
come
to
realize
that
we
must
be
attending
to
general
herkimer
business
i
remained
silent
and
motionless
straining
my
ears
to
hear
what
the
painted
snakes
were
saying
and
at
the
same
time
expecting
to
receive
a
silent
protest
from
sergeant
corney
because
of
remaining
inactive
when
the
moments
were
so
precious
in
less
than
a
single
minute
i
knew
that
the
savages
were
speaking
of
peter
site
and
the
tightening
of
jacob
grip
told
that
he
too
was
aware
of
the
fact
because
i
can
understand
only
a
few
words
here
or
there
of
brant
native
tongue
it
would
be
impossible
to
set
down
exactly
what
the
villains
said
but
i
caught
enough
to
understand
that
the
prisoner
in
whom
we
were
so
deeply
interested
was
not
far
distant
probably
at
the
main
encampment
and
thayendanega
was
protecting
him
at
least
from
the
torture
why
the
sachem
had
taken
such
an
interest
in
the
unfortunate
man
i
could
not
make
out
most
likely
the
savages
themselves
were
ignorant
on
that
point
it
appeared
to
me
from
the
conversation
that
there
was
much
hard
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
indians
because
they
were
not
allowed
to
indulge
in
an
amusement
which
had
been
countenanced
by
more
than
one
officer
of
the
british
army
and
i
fancied
that
thayendanega
great
sachem
though
he
now
was
of
the
six
nations
would
have
no
little
trouble
in
holding
his
precious
followers
in
check
when
i
had
learned
as
much
as
has
been
set
down
here
i
felt
a
tugging
at
my
shirt
and
knew
without
seeing
him
that
sergeant
corney
was
not
willing
to
remain
at
this
point
any
longer
the
savages
had
begun
to
speak
of
leger
and
what
he
might
succeed
in
doing
so
far
as
the
siege
was
concerned
therefore
it
did
not
seem
probable
we
would
hear
more
regarding
peter
sitz
this
much
jacob
must
have
understood
as
well
as
i
for
when
i
forced
myself
backward
pushing
vigorously
against
him
he
gave
way
and
we
thus
slowly
retreated
until
having
gained
such
a
distance
from
the
feasting
murderers
that
it
seemed
safe
to
rise
to
our
feet
to
what
were
you
listenin
sergeant
corney
asked
in
a
whisper
and
with
no
slight
show
of
anger
because
i
had
lingered
so
long
in
the
fewest
words
possible
i
told
him
what
we
had
heard
and
when
i
was
come
to
an
end
of
the
brief
recital
jacob
asked
as
if
believing
that
now
all
our
plans
would
be
changed
what
are
we
to
do
that
for
which
we
came
sergeant
corney
replied
decidedly
but
we
know
that
my
father
is
near
at
hand
and
if
thayendanega
grows
careless
or
indifferent
will
be
tortured
to
death
ay
lad
an
i
could
be
no
more
sorry
if
peter
sitz
was
my
brother
but
we
can
not
now
do
anything
to
aid
him
even
though
the
way
lay
clear
before
us
and
the
old
man
laid
his
hand
on
jacob
shoulder
as
if
to
give
emphasis
to
the
words
we
are
to
push
on
toward
the
fort
an
must
not
heed
any
other
duty
but
we
stand
as
much
chance
of
rescuing
my
father
as
we
do
of
speech
with
colonel
gansevoort
an
surely
you
will
not
leave
a
friend
to
be
tortured
to
death
jacob
said
pleadingly
and
speaking
incautiously
loud
lad
we
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
if
general
herkimer
was
in
your
father
place
i
would
turn
my
back
on
him
until
after
our
work
had
been
done
ca
you
see
that
by
loiterin
now
we
may
be
sacrificing
all
those
brave
fellows
who
are
making
ready
to
march
from
the
oriskany
in
the
hope
of
aiding
in
holdin
the
fort
that
is
your
final
word
jacob
asked
sharply
and
sergeant
corney
replied
feelingly
it
can
not
be
otherwise
we
are
bound
first
to
obey
orders
even
though
a
dozen
of
our
best
friends
were
bein
led
to
the
stake
an
then
you
will
obey
them
without
me
jacob
said
in
a
tone
which
i
knew
full
well
betokened
a
purpose
from
which
he
would
not
be
turned
by
words
two
will
stand
a
better
chance
of
gainin
the
fort
than
three
an
duty
calls
me
to
thayendanega
camp
but
surely
you
will
not
attempt
to
go
there
alone
i
cried
in
horror
even
though
you
should
come
face
to
face
with
your
father
you
could
not
hope
to
set
him
free
i
would
rather
die
by
his
side
than
have
him
believe
i
remained
idle
while
he
was
in
such
terrible
danger
if
you
can
not
be
persuaded
we
must
leave
you
an
that
without
delay
the
old
man
said
sadly
god
knows
i
would
do
all
a
man
might
to
aid
peter
sitz
but
if
he
was
here
at
this
minute
knowin
that
the
stake
was
bein
made
ready
for
him
he
would
say
that
we
were
bound
to
keep
on
toward
the
fort
regardless
of
his
fate
i
shall
go
to
him
jacob
replied
quietly
and
sergeant
corney
turned
aside
with
a
sigh
but
that
i
knew
beyond
a
peradventure
it
was
useless
i
would
have
said
all
in
my
power
to
keep
him
with
us
but
his
mind
was
fixed
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
could
not
well
blame
him
for
doing
as
i
would
have
done
regardless
of
any
duty
i
might
owe
to
general
herkimer
we
can
say
nothing
more
lad
sergeant
corney
said
to
me
inquiringly
and
i
shook
my
head
for
so
great
was
the
grief
in
my
heart
that
just
then
i
could
make
no
reply
i
believe
jacob
understood
how
keen
was
my
sorrow
at
thus
parting
when
the
chances
were
that
we
would
never
meet
again
in
this
world
for
as
if
to
put
an
end
to
the
agony
he
turned
abruptly
not
even
stopping
to
press
my
hand
and
in
an
instant
was
lost
to
view
amid
the
gloom
of
the
forest
already
had
our
venture
so
it
appeared
to
me
cost
the
life
of
one
of
our
small
party
and
mentally
i
reproached
myself
bitterly
for
having
left
cherry
valley
to
take
service
with
this
general
herkimer
who
could
as
well
have
sent
some
other
in
our
place
for
surely
all
in
his
command
were
not
known
to
thayendanega
following
i
as
captain
of
the
minute
boys
stationed
at
cherry
valley
could
not
have
been
accused
of
refusing
to
aid
the
cause
had
i
failed
to
serve
under
the
general
so
far
from
my
post
of
duty
as
it
was
however
we
had
come
a
long
distance
from
our
friends
and
already
sacrificed
a
life
uselessly
so
it
seemed
to
me
then
in
my
bitterness
of
spirit
come
lad
sergeant
corney
whispered
shaking
me
roughly
by
the
shoulder
as
if
he
would
drive
from
my
mind
the
painful
thoughts
we
can
not
do
as
jacob
would
have
us
and
there
is
an
end
of
that
matter
get
to
work
and
it
may
be
that
now
an
morning
but
one
of
us
will
remain
to
carry
the
message
i
had
never
before
heard
the
old
man
speak
in
so
despondent
a
tone
and
it
seemed
an
evil
omen
coming
as
the
words
did
when
we
were
ready
to
plunge
into
the
most
dangerous
portion
of
the
work
in
silence
i
led
the
way
once
more
making
such
a
détour
as
i
thought
would
carry
us
safely
past
that
party
of
savages
from
which
we
had
gained
such
painful
information
and
perhaps
half
an
hour
was
spent
in
advancing
at
a
snail
pace
but
in
the
direction
where
we
supposed
the
fort
stood
now
it
was
i
realized
that
some
one
well
acquainted
with
the
locality
should
have
been
sent
with
us
for
we
were
obliged
to
go
on
blindly
as
it
were
trusting
that
chance
and
what
we
might
see
of
the
disposition
of
the
enemy
forces
would
bring
us
to
the
point
we
desired
to
gain
for
neither
of
us
had
ever
visited
fort
schuyler
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
i
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
for
we
were
within
a
few
paces
of
half
a
dozen
white
men
as
could
be
told
even
in
the
darkness
by
the
outlines
of
their
clothing
these
last
appeared
to
be
stationed
at
that
point
for
none
of
them
made
any
attempt
to
go
away
during
the
two
or
three
minutes
i
remained
motionless
although
why
so
many
should
have
been
placed
there
as
sentinels
when
one
would
have
served
the
purpose
i
failed
to
understand
and
it
perplexed
me
not
a
little
for
it
was
necessary
that
we
should
know
whether
we
were
inside
the
lines
or
simply
confronting
their
outlying
pickets
there
was
nothing
for
it
however
but
to
crawl
backward
half
a
dozen
yards
and
then
make
another
détour
and
while
this
was
being
done
sergeant
corney
had
only
a
single
question
to
ask
which
was
as
to
whether
i
had
seen
white
men
or
indians
white
men
i
replied
and
no
less
than
half
a
dozen
standing
in
a
group
as
if
stationed
there
the
old
man
paused
an
instant
as
if
quite
as
much
perplexed
as
i
and
then
whispered
go
on
we
are
like
to
run
across
more
than
one
such
snag
an
what
is
worse
do
have
a
clear
idea
of
whether
we
shall
come
plump
on
to
the
fort
or
go
a
considerable
distance
to
one
side
of
it
again
i
advanced
making
an
even
wider
détour
than
before
and
in
ten
minutes
perhaps
we
were
come
upon
a
single
sentinel
a
soldier
who
stood
leaning
against
a
tree
as
if
and
i
was
less
careful
in
passing
him
because
he
did
not
appear
to
be
particularly
on
the
alert
again
and
again
we
nearly
stumbled
upon
a
squad
of
men
small
parties
of
indians
or
a
single
sentinel
until
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
all
force
must
be
distributed
throughout
the
thicket
and
i
began
to
despair
of
ever
making
our
way
through
now
we
were
where
it
seemed
as
dangerous
to
retreat
as
to
advance
and
i
strove
manfully
to
keep
from
my
mind
all
thoughts
of
the
perils
that
surrounded
us
lest
i
grow
at
the
very
time
when
all
my
courage
was
needed
if
we
would
save
our
lives
to
do
this
it
was
only
necessary
i
think
of
jacob
and
his
hazardous
venture
which
could
serve
no
good
purpose
even
though
he
succeeded
in
avoiding
the
enemy
therefore
my
mind
dwelt
on
the
perils
which
confronted
him
causing
me
in
a
measure
to
forget
where
i
myself
stood
to
go
on
in
such
a
manner
was
most
wearisome
and
i
was
at
the
end
of
my
strength
when
a
faint
lightness
in
the
eastern
sky
gave
warning
that
the
day
was
near
at
hand
at
the
same
moment
i
observed
this
fact
the
sergeant
gripped
me
by
the
arm
and
understanding
he
would
have
speech
with
me
i
halted
it
is
time
we
went
into
hidin
lad
although
i
did
count
we
would
come
within
sight
of
the
fort
before
bein
obliged
to
call
a
halt
where
can
we
hide
here
i
asked
bitterly
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
began
to
realize
for
the
first
time
since
the
general
had
explained
what
he
would
have
us
do
that
we
must
remain
concealed
from
view
during
all
the
hours
of
daylight
and
that
while
we
were
literally
surrounded
by
the
enemy
we
must
take
our
chances
in
the
first
dense
thicket
wherein
may
be
found
a
stout
tree
that
we
come
across
he
replied
an
now
instead
of
to
get
a
sight
of
the
fortification
turn
all
your
efforts
toward
a
this
promised
to
be
as
difficult
a
task
as
i
had
ever
undertaken
for
how
would
it
be
possible
in
the
darkness
to
say
whether
one
thicket
was
denser
than
another
and
without
spending
precious
time
in
the
examination
to
learn
if
there
was
a
stout
tree
within
any
certain
clump
of
bushes
because
the
sergeant
had
said
we
were
to
halt
where
was
a
tree
i
believed
he
proposed
spending
the
day
amid
the
branches
and
any
one
who
has
ever
been
in
a
forest
can
readily
understand
how
few
there
are
of
such
however
we
were
there
and
within
another
hour
must
be
screened
from
view
after
some
fashion
therefore
it
was
useless
to
grumble
or
say
this
or
that
movement
was
impossible
but
rather
i
should
do
the
best
i
might
and
trust
to
the
chapter
of
accidents
that
i
did
not
lead
my
companion
into
what
would
prove
to
be
a
trap
all
the
thicket
looked
dense
in
the
night
but
when
i
was
finally
come
to
a
clump
of
bushes
through
which
it
was
difficult
to
force
my
way
i
stopped
and
whispered
to
sergeant
corney
this
seems
to
be
such
a
place
as
you
would
have
but
who
can
say
whether
it
will
answer
our
purpose
so
much
the
worse
for
us
if
it
does
not
the
old
man
replied
grimly
make
your
way
in
an
if
there
be
no
tree
to
give
us
a
we
must
take
our
chances
on
the
ground
for
the
day
is
comin
on
apace
and
indeed
he
said
no
more
than
the
truth
already
was
it
possible
for
me
to
see
surrounding
objects
dimly
to
be
sure
but
more
clearly
than
when
we
first
began
searching
for
a
place
of
refuge
unless
we
were
concealed
from
view
within
half
an
hour
we
might
as
well
march
straight
to
the
nearest
sentinel
and
give
ourselves
up
as
prisoners
there
was
much
to
be
desired
in
this
thicket
which
we
had
chosen
by
chance
as
was
learned
when
we
were
well
within
it
several
large
trees
grew
amid
the
clump
of
bushes
to
be
sure
but
the
foliage
was
not
so
dense
that
one
who
passed
near
at
hand
with
reasonable
alertness
would
have
failed
to
discover
us
lurking
there
it
is
better
than
the
open
country
sergeant
corney
said
when
i
would
have
found
fault
with
our
blind
choice
we
will
burrow
amid
these
small
bushes
until
daylight
an
then
if
necessary
go
to
roost
i
had
in
my
pocket
a
small
piece
of
corn
bread
and
when
i
would
have
divided
it
with
the
old
man
he
showed
me
about
the
same
quantity
which
he
had
saved
in
event
of
just
such
an
emergency
and
we
munched
the
dry
food
with
no
very
keen
appetites
but
eating
at
this
the
first
opportunity
in
order
to
keep
up
our
strength
for
the
struggle
which
must
ensue
before
we
gained
speech
with
those
in
the
fort
my
sorrow
because
jacob
had
left
us
on
a
venture
from
which
i
did
not
believe
he
could
ever
return
was
so
great
that
i
felt
no
desire
for
food
but
ate
it
from
a
sense
of
duty
even
as
i
had
turned
my
back
on
my
comrade
when
he
needed
aid
one
does
not
make
haste
with
such
a
meal
and
when
i
had
swallowed
the
last
dry
crumbs
which
were
like
to
have
choked
me
the
day
had
fully
come
it
can
readily
be
imagined
that
we
crept
even
nearer
the
edge
of
the
thicket
than
was
really
safe
in
order
to
get
some
idea
of
our
position
and
to
my
great
surprise
and
delight
i
found
that
we
had
come
in
as
direct
a
course
as
if
we
had
followed
a
blazed
trail
there
before
us
and
less
than
three
hundred
yards
distant
was
the
fortification
over
which
was
floating
the
flag
made
from
capt
abraham
swartwout
cloak
and
because
we
were
on
high
ground
it
was
possible
to
see
the
americans
moving
about
within
bent
on
this
task
or
that
duty
after
one
hasty
glance
we
crept
back
into
the
middle
of
the
thicket
and
there
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
enemies
we
two
held
a
whispered
conversation
regarding
the
situation
it
was
only
natural
we
should
first
congratulate
each
other
on
our
good
fortune
in
having
come
unwittingly
to
the
very
spot
we
most
desired
to
gain
and
then
i
said
simply
giving
words
to
the
thoughts
which
had
entered
my
mind
as
i
gazed
upon
the
fortification
he
who
crosses
the
clearing
between
here
and
the
fort
even
though
it
be
in
the
night
needs
to
wriggle
along
like
a
snake
else
will
one
of
thayendanega
painted
beauties
lift
his
scalp
it
is
a
bit
open
jest
in
front
of
here
but
i
took
note
that
further
to
the
westward
was
a
little
more
of
green
sergeant
corney
said
half
to
himself
and
i
knew
he
was
picturing
in
his
mind
the
two
of
us
making
the
attempt
where
was
not
a
blade
of
grass
to
give
shelter
for
the
green
of
which
he
spoke
was
nothing
more
than
the
fragment
of
a
bush
near
the
stockade
how
are
we
to
attract
their
attention
providin
we
succeed
in
up
under
the
wall
i
asked
after
a
long
pause
and
he
replied
grimly
i
answer
that
question
after
you
told
me
how
we
goin
to
stop
shootin
at
us
while
we
tryin
to
get
across
then
it
was
i
understood
that
even
though
the
enemy
did
not
see
us
while
we
were
making
our
way
over
the
plain
the
sentinels
in
the
fort
were
doubtless
on
the
alert
against
just
such
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
indians
and
there
was
little
question
but
that
they
would
fire
at
any
moving
thing
which
came
within
their
line
of
vision
it
seems
to
me
that
we
be
between
two
fires
i
said
with
a
feeble
attempt
to
speak
in
a
jovial
tone
and
sergeant
corney
reply
was
much
like
a
bucket
of
cold
water
full
in
my
face
that
exactly
the
case
lad
an
i
countin
that
betwixt
we
be
peppered
in
fine
shape
else
there
are
some
mighty
poor
marksmen
hereabouts
why
did
you
tell
the
general
that
we
could
carry
his
message
did
you
think
of
all
this
at
the
time
ay
lad
it
was
pictured
in
my
mind
much
as
we
see
it
now
but
he
said
we
were
to
do
the
job
an
it
was
for
me
to
point
out
the
danger
why
not
if
you
felt
certain
we
would
be
shot
i
cried
angrily
because
a
soldier
has
good
reason
when
he
enlists
to
expect
he
stop
a
bullet
else
what
would
be
the
need
of
powder
an
ball
having
said
this
the
old
man
relapsed
into
silence
as
if
he
was
trying
to
figure
out
how
the
work
might
be
done
with
less
of
danger
and
i
sat
staring
at
him
in
a
rage
for
to
my
mind
he
had
much
the
same
as
compassed
his
own
death
and
mine
by
not
speaking
of
all
the
perils
in
our
path
now
it
was
that
i
almost
envied
jacob
his
position
it
is
true
the
odds
were
strongly
against
his
being
able
to
make
his
way
through
the
camp
without
being
captured
yet
it
was
possible
for
him
at
any
time
to
give
over
the
attempt
and
retrace
his
steps
whereas
we
were
absolutely
penned
up
in
the
thicket
where
retreat
was
even
more
perilous
than
advance
fume
and
fret
as
i
might
it
was
not
possible
to
mend
matters
and
i
stretched
myself
out
at
full
length
under
the
bushes
with
the
idea
in
mind
that
it
would
be
better
if
we
were
captured
at
once
for
then
we
would
be
spared
just
so
much
suspense
yet
when
sergeant
corney
suggested
that
we
were
not
as
well
hidden
from
view
as
we
should
be
i
was
alarmed
on
the
instant
how
that
day
was
passed
by
us
i
can
hardly
say
even
now
when
i
look
back
calmly
upon
all
the
incidents
which
were
then
so
terrifying
we
had
eaten
the
last
crumb
of
our
corn
bread
in
the
morning
without
appeasing
the
hunger
which
assailed
us
and
now
could
only
chew
the
twigs
of
the
bushes
striving
to
make
ourselves
believe
we
extracted
nourishment
therefrom
more
than
once
straggling
soldiers
or
indians
passed
near
where
we
were
hidden
but
no
one
thought
of
searching
the
thicket
for
those
who
were
friendly
to
the
garrison
because
none
save
idiots
like
ourselves
would
thus
have
ventured
into
the
lion
mouth
screened
as
we
were
from
the
lightest
breath
of
wind
it
was
cruelly
hot
in
that
tiny
streams
of
perspiration
ran
down
my
face
wetting
the
leaves
beneath
my
head
and
i
chewed
them
in
the
vain
hope
that
the
suspicion
of
moisture
might
serve
to
quench
my
thirst
i
rejoiced
when
the
sun
began
to
sink
in
the
west
even
though
it
was
as
i
believed
bringing
the
hour
of
my
death
so
much
the
nearer
but
i
soon
came
to
understand
that
sergeant
corney
was
not
disposed
to
make
the
perilous
venture
without
first
having
taken
all
possible
precautions
for
our
safety
when
the
day
was
within
an
hour
of
its
close
i
suddenly
became
aware
that
the
old
soldier
was
stripping
the
fringe
from
his
shirt
and
immediately
i
sat
bolt
upright
fancying
for
the
moment
that
he
had
lost
his
reason
what
are
you
doin
i
asked
sharply
and
he
replied
with
a
faint
smile
if
the
sentinel
who
stands
on
the
wall
of
the
fort
facin
us
is
to
his
business
as
a
soldier
should
then
there
a
chance
i
can
let
him
know
these
bushes
shelter
decent
people
while
speaking
he
had
been
cutting
cautiously
with
his
knife
one
of
the
longer
branches
which
helped
to
screen
us
from
view
and
when
it
had
been
severed
he
trimmed
it
with
infinite
care
as
if
our
welfare
depended
upon
its
being
smooth
and
clean
when
this
had
been
done
to
his
satisfaction
and
it
seemed
to
give
him
greatest
pleasure
to
keep
me
in
suspense
as
to
his
purpose
he
tied
to
the
smaller
end
of
the
stick
the
fringe
from
his
shirt
you
goin
to
creep
out
an
wave
that
i
cried
in
the
tone
of
one
who
has
made
a
great
discovery
you
can
set
it
down
as
a
fact
that
i
wo
creep
very
far
out
the
old
man
replied
with
a
smile
it
only
the
ghost
of
a
chance
that
anybody
will
take
heed
of
it
an
yet
there
no
harm
in
the
tryin
when
finally
he
crept
cautiously
out
toward
the
edge
of
the
thicket
i
watched
him
as
eagerly
as
if
all
our
troubles
would
be
over
in
case
we
succeeded
in
attracting
the
attention
of
those
in
the
fort
whereas
no
matter
how
many
of
our
friends
might
see
the
waving
fringe
we
would
still
be
in
the
same
danger
of
getting
a
bullet
from
the
besiegers
it
ai
any
ways
certain
that
some
of
these
sneakin
injuns
do
see
my
signal
before
one
of
the
garrison
does
in
which
case
we
wo
have
to
puzzle
our
heads
about
gettin
into
the
fort
but
if
they
should
jump
on
me
you
best
take
to
your
heels
there
a
bare
chance
you
might
give
the
slip
in
the
squabble
for
i
should
knock
under
while
there
was
any
fight
left
in
me
illustration
sergeant
corney
waved
the
bit
of
fringe
slowly
to
and
fro
then
peering
through
the
branches
i
could
see
the
sentinel
on
the
wall
near
the
and
it
goes
without
saying
that
i
watched
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
for
some
gesture
which
might
tell
that
he
understood
what
was
of
so
much
importance
to
us
it
was
fortunate
that
we
had
blindly
stumbled
upon
a
a
few
yards
in
advance
of
the
enemy
line
of
watchers
otherwise
the
scheme
could
never
have
been
successful
even
as
it
was
i
expected
each
instant
that
some
painted
snake
would
take
it
into
his
wicked
head
to
wander
around
in
front
of
the
thicket
when
the
game
would
come
to
a
speedy
end
sergeant
corney
waved
the
bit
of
fringe
slowly
to
and
fro
in
such
a
manner
that
the
dull
color
of
the
deerskin
might
offer
a
contrast
against
the
green
of
the
foliage
and
when
five
minutes
or
more
had
passed
without
any
movement
on
the
part
of
the
sentinel
i
said
to
myself
that
there
was
no
possibility
we
could
catch
the
man
eye
the
old
soldier
was
not
one
easily
discouraged
during
ten
minutes
more
he
continued
his
efforts
now
moving
the
stick
to
and
fro
and
again
giving
to
it
an
motion
and
then
at
the
very
moment
when
all
hope
had
fled
from
my
heart
i
saw
the
man
straighten
himself
suddenly
as
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
then
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
that
sergeant
corney
had
succeeded
in
his
purpose
for
the
soldier
waved
his
hand
twice
and
bent
over
as
if
speaking
to
some
one
on
the
inside
now
it
was
that
i
expected
the
old
man
would
return
to
my
side
and
chuckle
over
our
good
fortune
but
he
remained
at
the
edge
of
the
thicket
while
i
might
have
counted
twenty
and
then
a
second
member
of
the
garrison
had
clambered
up
beside
the
first
another
hand
was
waved
in
reply
and
then
having
finished
his
task
in
good
shape
sergeant
corney
crept
back
to
me
as
he
whispered
gleefully
i
reckon
we
need
fear
that
any
of
the
garrison
will
shoot
at
us
this
night
an
what
more
to
our
advantage
we
wo
be
called
on
to
lay
behind
the
walls
very
long
tryin
to
attract
attention
it
was
a
great
plan
i
replied
as
if
all
our
troubles
were
at
an
end
and
then
again
came
the
thought
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
us
to
creep
out
from
the
thicket
under
the
very
noses
of
those
who
were
on
guard
and
straightway
all
my
fears
returned
it
no
longer
seemed
to
me
as
if
we
had
gained
any
great
advantage
from
the
old
man
efforts
chapter
vi
between
the
lines
as
the
sun
slowly
sank
behind
the
hills
in
the
west
i
forgot
the
thirst
and
the
hunger
which
had
assailed
me
so
great
was
the
fear
in
my
mind
because
of
what
we
were
about
to
attempt
that
bodily
discomforts
seemed
as
nothing
it
was
a
most
daring
venture
we
were
to
make
and
one
wherein
the
chances
were
no
less
than
ninety
and
nine
out
of
an
hundred
that
we
would
be
killed
or
captured
before
having
well
started
on
the
enterprise
and
yet
the
attempt
must
be
made
however
we
might
be
for
as
i
have
already
said
there
was
as
much
danger
in
retreating
as
advancing
the
only
thing
in
our
favor
was
that
the
night
promised
to
be
dark
already
were
clouds
hiding
the
setting
sun
the
wind
was
growing
stronger
and
it
was
reasonable
to
believe
that
within
an
hour
the
heavens
would
be
covered
as
with
a
black
veil
after
having
succeeded
in
attracting
the
attention
of
the
sentinels
sergeant
corney
crept
back
to
my
side
lying
there
at
full
length
and
in
silence
i
believed
his
anxiety
as
to
the
outcome
of
this
mad
venture
was
so
great
that
he
did
not
dare
indulge
in
conversation
and
because
of
such
idea
was
i
even
more
cast
down
in
spirit
i
tried
to
count
the
seconds
in
order
to
have
some
knowledge
of
the
passage
of
time
but
could
not
fix
my
mind
upon
such
a
simple
act
when
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
night
was
considerably
more
than
i
whispered
tremblingly
to
my
companion
have
you
given
over
tryin
to
gain
the
fort
why
should
you
think
so
lad
he
asked
as
if
in
surprise
we
had
best
make
the
venture
after
midnight
rather
than
now
while
the
enemy
is
astir
so
great
was
my
fear
as
to
what
the
future
might
have
in
store
for
us
that
i
had
failed
to
hear
the
hum
of
voices
until
my
attention
was
thus
attracted
and
then
i
realized
that
it
was
yet
quite
early
in
the
evening
instead
of
well
toward
morning
as
i
had
supposed
because
he
did
not
speak
again
i
understood
that
sergeant
corney
was
not
inclined
for
conversation
and
i
lay
there
motionless
and
silent
until
it
was
as
if
twice
four
and
twenty
hours
had
passed
when
the
old
man
rising
to
a
sitting
posture
whispered
cautiously
i
reckon
lad
that
the
time
has
come
for
us
to
make
a
try
at
the
general
message
as
i
figger
it
we
had
best
bear
off
to
the
westward
strikin
the
fort
on
that
side
nearabout
where
the
fragment
of
a
bush
stands
than
to
push
on
for
the
main
gate
it
seems
reasonable
the
enemy
will
watch
that
part
of
the
works
closer
than
any
other
in
order
to
guard
against
a
sortie
an
if
colonel
gansevoort
has
been
told
of
our
signals
every
sentinel
will
be
on
the
alert
for
us
well
i
asked
as
he
ceased
speaking
for
an
instant
we
do
the
trick
after
this
fashion
you
shall
go
ahead
an
i
keep
two
or
three
paces
in
the
rear
why
do
you
propose
such
a
plan
as
that
i
asked
suspiciously
and
the
old
man
replied
hesitatingly
as
if
averse
to
having
his
reasons
known
in
case
they
see
us
before
we
are
well
on
our
way
he
who
is
in
advance
stands
the
best
show
of
escapin
but
why
should
my
chances
be
made
any
better
than
yours
i
asked
angrily
for
even
though
i
was
afraid
of
the
venture
it
was
not
in
my
mind
to
be
treated
like
a
child
as
seemed
to
be
the
case
when
the
old
man
was
considering
my
safety
rather
than
his
own
well
lad
there
are
two
reasons
to
my
way
of
figgerin
but
the
last
is
the
strongest
first
off
i
have
a
much
shorter
time
to
live
in
this
world
than
you
therefore
if
one
life
is
taken
it
had
best
be
mine
so
far
as
the
patriot
cause
is
concerned
then
agin
an
this
has
weight
to
it
in
case
we
are
chased
you
should
be
able
to
run
faster
than
me
an
we
must
bear
in
mind
the
fact
that
to
deliver
the
message
is
the
one
important
thing
our
lives
amount
to
very
little
compared
with
that
i
could
not
well
make
protest
after
this
explanation
and
in
fact
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
little
choice
of
position
if
the
enemy
discovered
us
at
any
time
while
we
were
between
the
lines
our
fate
was
certain
and
he
who
was
three
paces
in
advance
would
have
no
more
show
of
escaping
the
bullets
than
the
one
who
remained
in
the
rear
are
we
to
go
now
i
asked
striving
earnestly
to
prevent
my
voice
from
trembling
ay
lad
i
reckon
it
time
and
the
old
man
tightened
his
belt
as
he
spoke
throw
away
your
rifle
or
strap
it
on
your
back
where
there
no
chance
it
will
hinder
the
progress
an
once
havin
started
keep
your
mind
well
on
the
fact
that
we
must
get
there
heedin
not
what
lies
behind
then
he
gently
forced
me
to
the
edge
of
the
thicket
where
we
halted
an
instant
to
make
certain
there
was
no
one
in
the
immediate
vicinity
after
which
was
begun
such
an
advance
as
i
hope
never
to
be
forced
into
again
for
of
a
verity
it
was
strive
as
i
might
it
was
impossible
during
the
first
two
or
three
minutes
of
the
painful
journey
to
prevent
myself
from
fancying
that
half
a
dozen
of
thayendanega
painted
wolves
were
creeping
up
close
behind
me
enjoying
the
mental
torture
caused
by
my
suspense
and
then
suddenly
my
mind
was
cleared
of
fears
even
as
the
heavens
are
of
clouds
after
a
storm
as
i
ceased
to
think
of
what
lay
behind
remembering
that
my
efforts
be
successful
else
patriot
blood
might
flow
in
streams
we
were
lying
flat
upon
the
ground
pulling
ourselves
painfully
along
by
our
hands
and
pushing
with
our
toes
whenever
it
was
possible
to
get
a
leverage
on
the
hard
earth
moving
perhaps
no
more
than
twelve
inches
each
moment
had
leger
sentinels
kept
the
strict
watch
which
the
siege
demanded
of
them
we
would
not
have
gone
a
dozen
paces
before
being
discovered
but
that
we
did
move
out
from
the
thicket
without
causing
an
alarm
was
as
i
believe
due
to
the
fact
that
the
enemy
contented
themselves
with
watching
the
main
gate
of
the
fort
fancying
that
only
from
such
quarter
could
any
danger
menace
them
they
had
so
many
scouts
out
between
the
fort
and
oriskany
that
it
probably
seemed
to
be
an
absolute
impossibility
any
of
the
patriots
could
come
through
their
lines
undetected
however
it
may
be
we
did
succeed
in
crossing
that
open
space
without
being
seen
by
those
who
would
have
delighted
in
torturing
us
to
death
but
it
was
as
if
i
lived
a
full
lifetime
before
coming
within
the
deep
shadows
cast
by
the
walls
on
the
west
side
at
the
point
decided
upon
by
sergeant
corney
some
moments
before
we
arrived
i
understood
and
my
heart
literally
bounded
with
joy
that
those
on
the
inside
were
already
aware
of
our
approach
and
waiting
to
receive
us
for
we
heard
subdued
voices
from
the
sentinels
on
the
walls
as
if
they
were
giving
information
to
those
below
of
our
progress
it
a
big
thing
we
have
done
lad
sergeant
corney
said
as
he
drew
himself
up
by
my
side
while
both
of
us
hugged
the
earthworks
as
limpets
do
a
rock
it
stands
to
reason
we
be
in
danger
many
a
time
before
we
go
out
from
this
world
unless
it
so
chances
that
we
come
to
grief
here
but
i
dare
venture
to
say
we
never
be
nearer
death
than
we
have
been
since
leaving
the
thicket
the
relief
of
mind
was
so
great
and
the
knowledge
that
we
had
come
thus
far
undetected
under
the
very
eyes
of
a
watchful
enemy
was
so
overpowering
that
i
could
not
for
a
moment
make
reply
and
by
the
time
i
had
gathered
my
scattered
senses
scattered
through
very
joy
we
heard
voices
from
the
inside
which
told
that
the
men
were
seeking
to
learn
exactly
where
we
were
keep
right
on
till
you
come
to
the
i
heard
a
voice
whisper
and
the
words
had
little
or
no
meaning
to
me
for
i
was
not
familiar
with
the
names
of
different
portions
of
a
regular
fort
but
the
sergeant
seemed
to
understand
the
command
for
he
began
to
creep
in
a
southerly
direction
still
keeping
within
the
shadow
of
the
wall
until
we
arrived
where
was
a
stockade
this
as
i
afterward
came
to
know
was
the
which
as
yet
was
in
an
unfinished
condition
and
protected
by
a
stockade
of
logs
between
each
of
which
last
were
spaces
in
some
cases
two
or
three
inches
wide
by
lying
with
our
faces
against
these
narrow
openings
it
was
possible
to
hold
converse
with
those
on
the
inside
almost
as
well
as
if
we
were
within
the
walls
who
are
you
and
where
did
you
come
from
a
voice
asked
and
sergeant
corney
took
it
upon
himself
much
to
my
relief
to
act
as
spokesman
messengers
sent
by
general
herkimer
who
have
come
from
oriskany
when
did
you
leave
there
yesterday
we
thought
the
woods
were
overrun
with
indians
and
tories
so
they
are
but
by
some
lucky
chance
we
have
come
through
thus
far
in
safety
and
would
have
speech
with
the
commandant
i
am
colonel
gansevoort
my
people
saw
your
signal
this
afternoon
and
i
myself
have
been
watching
for
your
arrival
but
supposed
you
to
be
fugitives
for
i
never
dared
hope
there
was
a
possibility
of
reinforcements
so
near
at
hand
will
you
make
an
attempt
to
get
in
by
the
is
there
any
other
entrance
sir
yes
but
the
enemy
have
been
keeping
sharp
watch
there
since
noon
as
if
thinking
something
of
this
same
kind
might
be
attempted
we
will
deliver
our
message
sir
and
then
decide
what
to
do
the
old
man
said
grimly
the
words
had
best
be
repeated
now
for
we
may
be
unable
to
utter
them
half
an
hour
later
then
sergeant
corney
delivered
the
message
with
which
we
were
charged
and
during
a
full
minute
after
he
ceased
speaking
the
commandant
remained
silent
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
to
say
it
would
be
folly
to
give
him
now
the
signal
of
your
arrival
since
to
discharge
one
of
the
cannon
when
there
is
no
direct
target
in
sight
would
be
to
apprise
leger
of
all
the
facts
if
it
were
possible
for
you
to
return
i
would
say
that
we
will
signal
the
moment
my
men
are
ready
for
the
sortie
i
am
of
the
mind
that
there
will
be
no
more
danger
in
going
back
than
in
trying
to
enter
the
fort
sergeant
corney
said
half
to
himself
doubtless
the
enemy
are
watchin
the
so
closely
that
we
would
be
seen
tryin
to
gain
it
for
on
that
side
the
shadow
is
less
than
here
and
if
there
be
large
numbers
posted
to
prevent
an
entrance
then
must
we
come
to
grief
meaning
what
colonel
gansevoort
asked
with
no
slight
tinge
of
impatience
in
his
tone
as
if
he
did
not
care
to
hear
the
old
soldier
summing
up
all
the
situation
meanin
that
we
are
runnin
no
greater
risks
in
goin
back
to
general
herkimer
or
at
least
not
many
more
than
by
tryin
to
gain
admission
to
the
fort
it
will
simplify
matters
if
you
choose
to
return
but
i
would
not
ask
any
man
to
do
so
in
view
of
all
the
danger
what
do
you
say
lad
sergeant
corney
asked
laying
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
although
i
would
have
given
anything
i
possessed
to
have
been
at
that
moment
behind
the
walls
i
was
not
minded
to
show
that
my
courage
was
less
than
his
therefore
i
replied
it
is
for
you
to
say
accordin
to
the
agreement
we
made
but
i
would
not
set
off
against
your
wishes
because
of
the
danger
in
the
road
although
i
claim
it
would
be
quite
as
great
if
we
attempted
to
enter
the
fort
at
once
then
it
is
decided
you
will
return
to
general
herkimer
colonel
gansevoort
said
quickly
as
if
fearing
lest
we
might
repent
of
our
decision
tell
him
that
within
five
minutes
after
giving
the
signal
we
will
make
a
sortie
from
the
main
gate
in
the
direction
of
oriskany
an
if
it
should
be
that
we
did
get
through
alive
sergeant
corney
said
as
if
to
himself
and
the
commandant
replied
quickly
in
such
case
without
means
of
knowing
what
has
happened
to
you
we
shall
make
the
sortie
and
shed
much
blood
uselessly
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
before
you
start
the
old
soldier
hesitated
as
if
unable
to
think
of
anything
we
needed
and
i
remembering
the
hunger
which
had
assailed
us
while
we
lay
hidden
in
the
thicket
replied
if
it
so
be
you
could
spare
us
a
bit
of
corn
bread
we
would
be
the
better
able
to
make
a
hurried
journey
that
you
shall
have
and
in
plenty
the
commandant
said
as
if
relieved
at
knowing
our
wants
could
be
gratified
with
so
little
trouble
and
sergeant
corney
added
only
so
much
as
we
can
put
in
our
pockets
for
this
is
not
the
time
to
encumber
ourselves
even
with
provisions
some
of
the
soldiers
who
had
been
standing
near
by
hurried
away
returning
a
few
moments
later
with
as
much
bread
as
would
have
served
to
satisfy
our
hunger
for
a
week
at
least
when
such
a
quantity
as
we
needed
for
one
meal
had
been
pushed
out
between
the
logs
of
the
stockade
my
companion
whispered
to
the
commandant
we
shall
strike
into
the
thicket
to
the
westward
making
a
circle
to
the
south
around
the
fort
until
coming
to
the
road
leading
to
oriskany
crossing
the
river
just
below
here
and
now
sir
if
you
have
no
further
demands
we
will
go
may
god
have
you
in
his
keeping
the
colonel
said
fervently
and
without
waiting
to
hear
more
the
old
soldier
set
off
this
time
leaving
it
for
me
to
bring
up
the
rear
now
it
was
i
came
to
understand
that
the
rain
was
beginning
to
fall
the
wind
came
in
spiteful
gusts
betokening
a
storm
and
i
could
have
hugged
myself
with
glee
at
the
thought
that
the
elements
were
favoring
us
in
the
attempt
which
at
the
outset
had
seemed
doomed
to
failure
before
we
had
traversed
half
the
distance
from
the
fort
to
the
thicket
on
the
westerly
side
the
rain
was
falling
heavily
and
the
wind
whistling
at
such
a
rate
as
to
have
drowned
any
ordinary
noise
we
might
make
in
forcing
our
way
through
the
foliage
never
had
a
storm
which
promised
much
bodily
discomfort
been
so
warmly
welcomed
by
me
never
had
one
been
more
sadly
needed
by
those
who
fought
against
the
king
and
his
savage
followers
for
the
cause
of
american
liberty
it
is
well
known
that
indians
like
cats
are
averse
to
exposing
their
bodies
to
rain
and
when
we
set
out
on
the
return
i
had
but
little
fear
believing
that
every
one
of
thayendanega
followers
would
be
hugging
his
lodge
closely
while
the
tories
would
find
it
difficult
to
discern
us
from
any
great
distance
as
we
lay
prone
upon
the
ground
lest
i
spend
too
many
words
in
the
telling
of
it
let
me
say
in
short
that
we
gained
the
thicket
without
causing
an
alarm
and
what
was
really
strange
made
our
way
through
it
in
a
westerly
direction
for
fully
a
mile
without
meeting
any
living
being
then
it
was
that
sergeant
corney
came
to
a
halt
and
taking
the
corn
bread
from
his
pocket
began
to
munch
it
greedily
as
he
said
to
me
speaking
indistinctly
because
of
the
fulness
of
his
mouth
i
reckon
lad
we
passed
the
britishers
lines
an
can
begin
to
circle
southward
from
this
point
while
we
were
creeping
away
from
the
fort
beginning
the
second
journey
before
having
had
time
to
rest
from
the
first
i
had
said
to
myself
again
and
again
that
it
was
the
act
of
madmen
for
us
to
make
any
attempt
at
gaining
general
herkimer
forces
in
the
first
place
there
was
no
real
necessity
for
such
dangerous
labor
because
the
signal
could
have
been
given
by
colonel
gansevoort
at
a
reasonably
early
hour
next
morning
and
thus
our
commander
would
have
known
that
the
message
was
delivered
we
were
risking
our
lives
foolishly
and
when
the
old
soldier
spoke
of
making
a
circle
from
that
point
in
a
tone
which
told
that
he
was
very
well
contented
with
himself
and
what
he
had
done
i
lost
my
temper
and
replied
sharply
ay
we
have
got
through
the
lines
safely
because
of
the
storm
which
was
a
lucky
chance
in
our
favor
and
one
we
could
not
have
foreseen
when
you
were
so
foolish
as
to
propose
that
we
go
back
it
would
have
pleased
you
better
had
we
made
the
attempt
to
get
into
the
fort
ay
ten
times
over
for
then
instead
of
roaming
these
woods
taking
a
fool
chances
of
bein
shot
down
we
might
be
comfortable
and
in
safety
an
remained
there
so
long
as
pleased
colonel
gansevoort
for
once
inside
that
fort
we
placed
ourselves
under
his
command
well
and
why
not
i
asked
in
surprise
because
it
does
not
please
me
to
linger
when
there
is
other
work
to
be
done
but
there
was
no
real
need
of
undertakin
this
task
i
said
with
irritation
yet
it
gave
us
an
excuse
to
which
he
would
listen
for
leavin
when
had
we
told
the
truth
i
question
if
he
had
not
tried
to
stop
us
well
what
is
the
truth
i
cried
sharply
is
there
nothin
in
your
mind
that
we
are
bound
to
do
now
the
message
has
been
delivered
do
you
mean
to
aid
jacob
i
asked
as
a
sudden
light
began
to
dawn
on
me
ay
lad
all
of
that
neither
you
nor
i
would
have
let
him
gone
alone
in
the
hopeless
task
of
rescuin
his
father
had
it
not
been
that
duty
demanded
of
us
to
keep
our
faces
turned
toward
yonder
fort
now
we
have
done
that
which
general
herkimer
required
we
can
set
out
to
fulfil
our
duty
toward
the
lad
an
this
goin
back
on
the
road
to
oriskany
is
but
little
more
than
we
would
be
forced
to
do
in
order
to
gain
the
spot
where
we
parted
with
him
for
i
countin
that
he
was
then
near
by
the
place
where
his
father
is
held
prisoner
i
could
have
hugged
the
old
man
but
that
he
might
have
fancied
i
had
lost
my
senses
when
we
parted
with
jacob
there
was
no
thought
in
my
mind
that
sergeant
corney
had
the
slightest
idea
of
joining
in
what
was
a
most
desperate
venture
and
i
even
fancied
he
felt
a
certain
sense
of
relief
in
having
such
a
good
excuse
for
not
sticking
his
nose
into
the
indian
encampment
but
now
i
understood
that
all
the
while
he
held
firm
to
the
determination
to
do
whatsoever
he
might
toward
aiding
peter
sitz
and
i
began
to
feel
real
affection
for
the
noble
old
man
whether
we
might
be
able
to
find
jacob
or
not
and
the
chances
were
that
he
had
already
been
made
prisoner
we
could
say
to
ourselves
that
the
poor
lad
was
not
deserted
by
us
in
his
hour
of
need
and
if
the
worst
happened
it
would
be
no
slight
satisfaction
to
us
in
after
years
the
storm
increased
each
moment
and
we
were
soon
wetted
to
the
skin
but
hardly
conscious
of
the
discomfort
because
of
the
safety
which
this
downpour
brought
to
us
i
had
never
given
sergeant
corney
credit
for
any
great
knowledge
of
woodcraft
because
he
came
to
us
from
over
the
seas
where
his
life
had
been
spent
fighting
battles
in
the
open
and
could
not
be
expected
to
cope
with
the
savage
foe
as
did
our
people
who
had
always
been
accustomed
to
the
skulking
methods
of
warfare
practised
by
the
redskins
now
however
i
was
forced
to
give
him
credit
for
being
wiser
than
i
in
the
forest
since
in
the
darkness
and
amid
the
tumult
caused
by
the
wind
and
rain
he
made
the
détour
as
if
a
broad
trail
stretched
out
before
him
under
the
sunlight
and
we
around
the
fortification
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
or
more
without
varying
so
far
as
could
be
told
a
single
hair
from
the
true
course
not
until
we
were
come
to
the
trail
which
led
to
oriskany
did
the
old
man
halt
and
then
it
was
to
say
to
me
from
this
on
i
allowin
we
had
better
be
cautious
how
we
move
but
surely
there
is
no
danger
of
meetin
any
of
the
savages
now
i
said
like
a
simple
and
he
replied
with
a
laugh
true
for
you
lad
but
general
herkimer
was
to
begin
an
advance
on
the
mornin
after
we
left
camp
and
he
should
be
nearabout
to
run
upon
his
sentinels
in
the
darkness
might
not
be
agreeable
from
that
on
until
half
an
hour
had
passed
we
pressed
forward
cautiously
and
well
it
was
that
we
did
so
for
suddenly
i
came
upon
a
levelled
musket
which
would
have
been
discharged
but
for
my
crying
out
quickly
as
i
swerved
to
one
side
we
are
messengers
for
the
general
we
are
friends
you
come
from
an
odd
direction
if
that
be
true
was
the
reply
and
at
the
same
instant
a
vigorous
hand
seized
me
by
the
then
it
was
that
sergeant
corney
stepped
forward
as
he
asked
are
you
of
general
herkimer
force
how
much
will
it
benefit
you
to
get
such
information
nay
nay
friend
there
is
no
need
of
bein
overcautious
with
us
we
are
two
of
the
three
messengers
who
left
camp
at
oriskany
to
go
to
fort
schuyler
and
are
now
returnin
returnin
the
soldier
said
for
it
was
indeed
one
of
general
sentinels
whom
we
had
come
upon
it
must
please
you
to
skulk
around
among
the
tories
and
savages
if
after
having
once
gained
the
fort
you
come
back
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
done
my
friend
sergeant
corney
replied
gravely
and
for
the
good
reason
that
colonel
gansevoort
had
a
message
for
us
to
deliver
to
the
general
you
are
right
in
questioning
us
for
under
such
situations
a
soldier
had
best
be
overcautious
than
too
credulous
but
now
we
ask
to
be
sent
to
the
commander
have
you
seen
any
of
the
enemy
near
at
hand
the
man
asked
i
can
swear
there
are
none
within
half
a
mile
then
come
with
me
and
the
sentinel
deserted
his
post
to
lead
us
into
camp
a
proceeding
which
called
forth
harsh
criticisms
from
sergeant
corney
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
being
benefited
thereby
chapter
vii
insubordination
it
was
near
to
daybreak
when
we
followed
the
soldier
to
where
general
herkimer
lay
under
a
shelter
of
pine
boughs
but
owing
to
the
storm
the
gloom
was
quite
as
profound
as
at
any
time
during
the
night
to
my
surprise
the
general
came
out
from
his
poor
apology
for
a
tent
on
hearing
our
voices
although
we
spoke
cautiously
low
and
even
then
i
could
but
ask
myself
why
it
was
that
an
experienced
soldier
such
as
he
was
not
giving
more
heed
to
his
bodily
welfare
for
men
on
the
eve
of
encountering
a
strong
enemy
surely
need
all
the
repose
which
can
be
had
i
was
soon
to
understand
why
the
commander
slept
so
lightly
and
to
learn
for
the
first
time
that
even
patriots
may
be
insubordinate
general
herkimer
did
not
at
first
recognize
us
in
the
gloom
but
when
sergeant
corney
made
himself
known
the
leader
said
in
a
tone
of
bitter
disappointment
then
you
did
not
succeed
in
getting
there
ay
that
we
did
sir
the
old
soldier
replied
emphatically
but
colonel
gansevoort
had
the
desire
to
send
a
message
to
you
and
we
have
brought
it
hopin
to
be
excused
from
further
duty
for
a
short
time
what
had
gansevoort
to
say
general
herkimer
asked
impatiently
and
sergeant
corney
repeated
the
message
twice
over
in
order
that
there
should
be
no
misunderstanding
as
to
its
meaning
very
well
we
will
be
on
the
alert
if
these
hotheads
can
be
restrained
the
general
replied
and
his
words
were
a
riddle
to
me
until
half
an
hour
later
then
he
asked
what
the
old
soldier
meant
by
wishing
to
be
excused
from
duty
and
the
sergeant
in
the
fewest
words
possible
gave
him
an
account
of
our
proceedings
since
leaving
the
camp
at
oriskany
concluding
by
saying
there
is
no
question
but
that
jacob
sitz
will
make
his
way
through
the
indian
encampment
if
it
can
be
done
by
any
person
yet
the
lad
is
blinded
by
love
for
his
father
an
will
take
altogether
too
desperate
chances
unless
there
be
some
one
at
hand
who
can
restrain
him
is
it
in
your
mind
that
the
prisoner
may
be
taken
out
of
camp
general
herkimer
exclaimed
we
do
not
count
on
any
such
good
fortune
but
follow
the
lad
simply
that
he
may
know
he
has
not
been
forgotten
if
it
so
be
you
need
us
sir
we
will
wait
until
you
have
gained
the
fort
before
making
any
effort
to
join
him
no
no
it
was
not
from
such
motives
that
i
spoke
the
general
interrupted
hastily
with
a
force
as
large
as
this
two
men
would
not
make
much
of
a
count
either
way
go
where
you
please
sergeant
braun
and
when
you
are
once
more
at
liberty
report
to
me
we
reckon
on
resting
our
legs
a
bit
sir
before
settin
out
you
will
not
advance
for
some
time
to
come
sir
how
far
do
you
count
we
are
from
the
enemy
pickets
not
above
two
miles
sir
then
we
shall
remain
here
unless
matters
get
beyond
my
control
until
having
heard
the
signal
having
made
this
to
me
odd
remark
the
commander
disappeared
from
view
inside
the
shelter
of
boughs
and
sergeant
corney
led
me
a
dozen
yards
or
more
from
what
might
by
courtesy
have
been
called
headquarters
when
he
halted
to
say
gravely
it
appears
that
things
are
not
just
as
they
should
be
in
this
camp
lad
how
do
you
mean
i
asked
in
surprise
you
heard
what
the
general
said
ay
well
who
of
his
men
are
making
the
trouble
before
i
could
so
much
as
make
a
guess
at
the
proper
answer
i
must
needs
be
told
that
there
was
trouble
for
through
having
failed
to
understand
exactly
what
the
commander
meant
i
had
not
suspected
that
there
was
anything
serious
brewing
but
sergeant
corney
experienced
as
he
was
in
such
matters
seemed
to
know
as
if
he
had
been
informed
in
so
many
words
that
insubordination
was
rife
in
the
camp
and
at
a
time
when
it
was
in
the
highest
degree
necessary
the
men
should
move
in
harmony
since
i
could
not
even
so
much
as
hazard
a
guess
the
old
man
forgetting
his
weariness
and
the
need
of
gaining
repose
led
me
out
to
where
he
had
been
halted
by
the
sentinel
and
finding
him
at
his
post
began
his
investigations
by
saying
we
two
have
just
come
from
fort
schuyler
an
knowin
full
well
how
strong
a
force
is
in
front
of
the
place
have
a
better
idea
of
the
kind
of
work
in
hand
than
you
who
have
seen
the
enemy
did
the
general
send
you
over
here
to
tell
me
that
the
man
asked
in
a
certain
tone
of
irritation
and
sergeant
corney
replied
soothingly
not
a
bit
of
it
my
friend
but
while
we
were
having
an
interview
with
the
commander
it
struck
me
that
matters
here
were
not
just
as
pleasant
as
they
should
be
an
instead
of
awakenin
some
one
who
might
need
more
slumber
we
thought
to
come
to
you
for
an
explanation
of
what
that
we
can
not
say
but
there
is
a
question
i
would
ask
you
as
between
man
and
man
for
mayhap
the
lives
of
us
all
depend
upon
the
general
sense
of
good
fellowship
tell
me
plainly
is
there
insubordination
in
the
camp
i
know
not
if
you
may
call
it
by
that
name
the
sentinel
said
somewhat
moodily
but
certain
it
is
we
would
have
relieved
the
fort
four
and
twenty
hours
ago
had
general
herkimer
not
held
us
back
with
such
a
force
as
we
have
here
it
can
not
be
a
hard
matter
to
do
about
as
we
please
look
you
the
man
continued
growing
more
confidential
the
general
has
no
less
than
eight
hundred
men
under
his
command
and
what
may
not
a
company
of
that
number
do
very
much
my
friend
but
your
eight
hundred
would
be
weak
indeed
unless
the
advance
was
made
at
the
proper
time
and
in
a
soldierly
fashion
so
your
people
have
been
complaining
because
the
commander
holds
them
back
ay
and
with
good
cause
when
colonels
cox
and
paris
say
openly
that
it
is
cowardly
for
us
to
loiter
here
surely
there
must
be
some
reason
in
their
words
a
full
third
of
this
force
believe
we
should
have
come
in
front
of
fort
schuyler
yesterday
mornin
an
think
you
all
those
can
be
mistaken
an
only
general
herkimer
stand
in
the
right
then
it
insubordination
sergeant
corney
said
sadly
and
the
sentinel
replied
angrily
it
is
only
common
sense
and
a
desire
to
aid
the
cause
if
we
are
eager
to
begin
a
battle
which
will
drive
the
tories
and
their
painted
allies
from
the
valley
surely
that
man
is
a
criminal
who
would
hold
us
back
if
you
had
been
where
this
lad
and
i
have
just
come
from
able
to
see
what
was
seen
by
us
you
would
talk
in
a
different
strain
the
old
soldier
said
hotly
why
man
colonel
gansevoort
himself
sent
us
back
to
request
that
you
remain
here
until
he
signals
so
that
everything
may
be
prepared
for
your
comin
and
we
knowin
how
important
it
was
you
delay
until
the
proper
moment
risked
our
lives
twenty
times
over
in
the
effort
to
bring
the
word
then
colonel
gansevoort
is
as
great
a
coward
as
general
herkimer
for
we
are
of
sufficient
strength
to
march
whithersoever
we
will
sergeant
corney
turned
as
if
to
go
and
then
suddenly
wheeling
upon
the
sentinel
said
i
do
not
read
my
bible
as
a
man
should
but
yet
i
remember
that
in
it
can
be
found
these
words
die
for
want
of
wisdom
an
allowin
my
friend
if
you
have
any
desire
to
linger
in
this
world
that
you
take
the
statement
home
mighty
strong
with
this
cutting
remark
which
for
a
moment
i
feared
would
provoke
a
downright
quarrel
sergeant
corney
strode
off
into
the
darkness
i
following
meekly
at
his
heels
surely
there
can
be
nothing
which
would
work
harm
in
this
desire
of
the
men
to
go
forward
i
said
when
the
sergeant
had
come
to
a
halt
throwing
himself
down
under
a
tree
as
if
to
rest
it
should
be
a
good
sign
when
soldiers
are
eager
to
go
into
battle
insubordination
wherever
you
find
it
is
the
most
dangerous
condition
of
affairs
that
can
be
figgered
out
when
a
man
puts
himself
under
a
leader
whether
to
fight
or
to
till
the
land
an
then
sets
up
his
opinions
against
those
of
the
one
who
is
supposed
to
know
best
else
he
would
be
in
command
matters
have
come
to
a
mighty
dangerous
pass
instead
of
helpin
the
men
inside
the
fort
this
regiment
is
likely
to
bring
them
to
grief
unless
things
are
changed
an
that
right
soon
now
get
what
sleep
you
can
lad
before
the
encampment
is
astir
the
old
man
added
changing
his
tone
very
suddenly
and
before
i
could
obey
he
drew
out
his
rifle
from
the
where
he
had
left
it
when
we
set
off
for
the
fort
i
laid
myself
down
by
his
side
but
it
was
not
to
sleep
for
i
realized
that
the
old
soldier
would
not
have
spoken
in
such
a
tone
unless
matters
according
to
his
belief
had
been
in
a
most
serious
condition
i
was
still
speculating
upon
the
situation
sorrowing
because
the
men
would
at
such
a
time
while
the
lives
of
so
many
depended
upon
concerted
action
set
up
their
individual
opinions
against
those
who
had
been
put
in
authority
over
them
when
a
bustle
on
every
side
told
that
the
soldiers
were
awakening
to
a
day
of
noble
struggle
for
their
country
or
worse
than
criminal
bickerings
if
sergeant
corney
had
really
closed
his
eyes
in
slumber
which
i
doubted
he
was
now
awakened
by
the
many
noises
and
a
plan
of
action
must
have
been
presented
to
him
in
his
dreams
for
he
spoke
like
one
who
is
determined
upon
some
decided
course
as
he
said
to
me
now
lad
we
fill
ourselves
up
with
one
good
hearty
meal
if
it
so
be
this
mutinously
inclined
army
has
a
proper
store
of
provisions
and
then
it
is
for
us
to
decide
whether
we
stay
among
those
who
are
like
to
come
to
grief
if
they
have
their
own
way
or
push
out
for
ourselves
i
did
not
understand
fully
what
he
meant
but
it
was
sufficient
for
me
that
he
was
no
longer
in
doubt
as
to
what
was
best
and
right
willingly
did
i
obey
his
orders
for
my
stomach
was
uncomfortably
empty
there
was
no
lack
of
food
in
this
command
which
seemed
to
be
divided
against
itself
and
the
breakfast
would
have
been
to
me
most
enjoyable
but
for
the
sauce
with
which
it
was
served
every
man
tongue
was
loosened
as
if
its
owner
was
the
only
man
amid
all
the
company
who
knew
exactly
which
was
the
wisest
course
to
pursue
and
i
dare
venture
to
say
never
a
commander
had
under
him
at
a
critical
moment
such
as
this
certainly
was
so
many
recruits
only
once
during
the
brief
meal
was
sergeant
corney
asked
for
information
although
the
word
had
passed
around
the
encampment
that
he
and
i
were
but
just
come
from
fort
schuyler
and
then
it
was
that
the
old
soldier
gave
those
insubordinate
men
such
a
as
they
deserved
and
i
dare
say
had
never
before
received
but
storm
as
he
might
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
arguments
he
brought
up
in
favor
of
general
herkimer
carrying
out
the
plans
suggested
by
colonel
gansevoort
only
served
to
make
those
imitation
soldiers
more
fixed
in
their
opinions
and
for
all
this
unseemly
wrangling
when
it
was
almost
a
crime
to
raise
one
voice
against
an
order
of
the
commander
i
lay
the
blame
upon
the
two
colonels
cox
and
paris
who
instead
of
holding
their
men
firmly
in
check
as
was
their
duty
openly
declared
that
general
herkimer
was
in
the
wrong
thus
fomenting
what
promised
to
be
a
most
serious
disturbance
and
what
was
finally
paid
for
over
and
over
again
in
blood
it
was
perhaps
half
an
hour
after
daybreak
when
colonel
cox
the
same
officer
who
by
injudicious
use
of
his
tongue
had
compassed
the
death
of
us
all
during
the
powwow
with
thayendanega
approached
general
herkimer
while
the
latter
was
walking
slowly
around
the
encampment
as
if
on
a
tour
of
inspection
and
said
in
a
tone
so
loud
that
all
in
the
vicinity
might
hear
it
are
we
to
go
forward
sir
as
men
should
who
set
out
to
relieve
a
besieged
fort
or
must
we
loiter
here
until
the
enemy
has
worked
his
will
for
an
instant
the
general
made
no
reply
and
sergeant
corney
whispered
to
me
angrily
that
man
deserves
to
be
shot
an
all
the
more
so
because
he
is
high
in
command
i
seen
troops
in
many
a
tight
place
durin
my
life
but
never
before
heard
any
thin
that
quite
come
up
to
that
when
after
a
pause
of
fully
a
moment
general
herkimer
spoke
it
was
to
ask
do
you
know
that
messengers
have
come
from
gansevoort
asking
that
we
hold
our
hands
until
he
shall
give
the
signal
i
have
heard
that
it
is
pretended
such
a
message
has
come
colonel
cox
replied
in
a
most
offensive
tone
and
i
could
see
sergeant
corney
clenching
his
fists
tightly
as
if
thereby
the
better
to
hold
himself
in
check
for
surely
were
we
two
entitled
to
make
reply
to
such
an
implied
accusation
the
garrison
will
make
a
sortie
immediately
after
giving
the
signal
and
we
can
thus
go
into
action
with
some
hope
of
success
general
herkimer
said
mildly
and
firmly
to
advance
before
gansevoort
is
ready
would
be
to
imperil
the
lives
of
all
this
command
speaking
more
particularly
for
yourself
sir
i
suppose
colonel
paris
said
with
a
sneer
and
it
would
have
given
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
have
struck
him
down
for
that
insult
then
the
three
officers
still
disputing
or
i
should
have
said
the
two
colonels
still
insulting
their
commander
who
continued
to
bear
with
them
beyond
that
point
where
forbearance
ceases
to
be
a
virtue
passed
out
of
earshot
for
the
time
being
and
the
men
in
the
immediate
vicinity
took
up
the
subject
until
to
my
surprise
i
found
that
nearly
all
of
them
sided
with
the
insubordinate
colonels
five
minutes
later
the
three
officers
had
approached
so
near
where
sergeant
corney
and
i
were
sitting
that
we
could
hear
their
words
once
more
and
then
to
my
indignation
and
the
old
soldier
anger
colonel
cox
cried
in
a
fury
as
he
planted
himself
directly
in
front
of
the
commander
you
are
not
only
a
coward
sir
but
a
tory
i
shall
always
hold
that
general
herkimer
was
a
brave
man
because
after
a
severe
effort
which
was
evident
to
us
all
he
so
far
mastered
his
righteous
anger
as
to
say
quietly
i
am
placed
over
you
as
a
father
and
guardian
and
shall
not
lead
you
into
difficulties
from
which
i
may
not
be
able
to
extricate
you
unless
the
soldiers
of
the
command
had
been
literally
beside
themselves
such
words
would
have
brought
them
to
a
proper
frame
of
mind
but
as
it
was
the
temperate
reply
seemed
to
inflame
their
anger
and
on
the
moment
there
was
a
very
babel
of
outcries
amid
which
it
was
only
possible
to
distinguish
the
demand
that
the
force
be
led
toward
fort
schuyler
without
delay
regardless
of
any
message
which
the
sergeant
and
i
might
have
brought
i
could
see
rather
than
hear
for
the
tumult
was
exceeding
great
that
the
two
colonels
continued
to
demand
that
the
commander
follow
their
plans
rather
than
adhere
to
his
own
and
it
was
a
veritable
fishwoman
squabble
during
twenty
minutes
or
more
when
general
herkimer
apparently
lost
his
temper
for
the
first
time
and
cried
in
a
tone
so
loud
that
the
words
could
be
distinctly
heard
all
over
the
encampment
i
will
give
the
command
to
march
forward
and
you
shall
soon
see
that
those
who
have
been
boasting
loudest
of
their
courage
will
be
the
first
to
run
on
meeting
the
enemy
i
was
afraid
it
would
come
to
that
sergeant
corney
whispered
to
me
with
a
sigh
it
do
stand
to
reason
that
any
man
could
hold
his
temper
a
great
while
under
such
a
as
those
curs
gave
the
commander
an
i
predictin
that
every
mother
son
of
will
rue
this
mornin
work
immediately
the
unwilling
permission
for
them
to
do
as
they
pleased
had
been
given
the
men
set
about
making
ready
for
the
advance
as
if
each
moment
was
of
the
greatest
value
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
after
general
herkimer
had
been
bullied
into
agreeing
to
that
which
his
better
judgment
told
him
to
be
wrong
the
company
was
ready
for
the
march
are
we
to
go
with
them
i
asked
of
the
sergeant
believing
for
the
moment
that
it
would
be
wiser
for
us
to
form
an
independent
command
of
two
ay
lad
i
thinkin
that
we
had
best
stand
by
the
general
for
he
may
be
needin
us
before
this
mornin
work
is
done
an
we
be
a
great
deal
of
time
from
jacob
because
in
case
of
arrivin
before
colonel
gansevoort
is
ready
for
us
the
scrimmage
will
soon
be
over
the
two
colonels
who
were
responsible
for
this
unsoldierly
method
of
conducting
a
campaign
busied
themselves
with
getting
the
men
into
lines
and
all
the
while
telling
what
it
was
possible
for
them
to
do
to
leger
and
his
force
as
if
anything
of
value
could
be
done
when
the
idiots
did
not
have
sufficient
sense
to
make
inquiries
of
those
who
could
give
them
full
information
regarding
the
strength
of
the
enemy
whom
they
were
so
soon
to
meet
even
had
sergeant
corney
not
decided
to
follow
the
commander
before
the
line
of
march
had
been
arranged
he
would
have
done
so
later
because
general
herkimer
beckoned
us
to
approach
when
he
took
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
column
are
you
counting
on
coming
with
me
despite
the
unnecessary
danger
which
we
know
will
be
encountered
he
asked
and
sergeant
corney
replied
promptly
ay
sir
that
we
are
and
had
already
settled
it
in
our
own
minds
which
portion
of
the
besieging
troops
are
we
likely
to
meet
first
if
we
follow
the
trail
the
general
asked
thayendanega
camp
lies
southeasterly
from
the
fort
but
how
far
it
may
be
from
the
trail
i
can
not
say
at
this
moment
the
report
of
a
rifle
from
the
direction
of
where
the
outermost
sentinels
were
stationed
startled
every
one
including
those
bloodthirsty
colonels
and
for
a
moment
all
stood
silent
and
motionless
waiting
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
alarm
then
it
was
that
the
sentinel
with
whom
the
sergeant
and
i
had
already
spoken
came
running
into
camp
for
it
seemed
a
favorite
trick
of
his
to
desert
a
post
of
duty
whenever
inclination
prompted
it
was
colonel
cox
who
asked
advancing
did
you
fire
that
gun
ay
sir
i
saw
two
indians
in
the
thicket
coming
as
if
from
the
direction
of
this
camp
did
you
kill
either
of
them
i
do
not
think
i
even
scratched
the
wood
is
too
dense
for
much
good
shooting
colonel
cox
wheeled
around
as
if
the
information
was
of
no
especial
importance
when
even
a
boy
like
me
understood
somewhat
of
its
import
and
carelessly
saluting
the
commander
reported
that
the
troops
were
ready
for
the
word
to
march
the
general
who
was
mounted
spurred
his
horse
on
to
the
head
of
the
column
sergeant
corney
and
i
following
as
best
we
might
and
once
in
the
lead
he
gave
the
command
is
nothing
to
be
done
toward
finding
out
whether
the
indians
whom
the
sentinel
saw
succeeded
in
getting
back
to
their
own
camp
i
asked
of
my
companion
and
he
replied
grimly
with
what
was
very
like
a
smile
of
satisfaction
on
his
wrinkled
face
these
officers
who
have
so
much
wind
to
spare
in
camp
can
not
afford
the
time
to
consider
such
trifles
as
a
few
scouts
skulkin
around
to
make
certain
of
what
we
are
doin
an
we
are
like
to
find
ourselves
ambushed
i
cried
in
dismay
ay
that
what
we
are
lad
an
i
thinkin
there
will
be
no
way
out
of
the
difficulty
until
some
of
these
insubordinates
are
killed
off
which
will
be
greatly
to
the
advantage
of
the
command
accordin
to
my
way
of
thinkin
i
will
set
down
here
that
which
i
read
in
a
book
several
years
after
the
day
sergeant
corney
and
i
followed
general
herkimer
on
what
we
believed
to
be
a
most
and
hazardous
march
in
view
of
colonel
request
and
from
the
words
it
will
be
seen
that
i
am
not
the
only
person
who
lays
blame
of
all
that
happened
upon
those
imitation
soldiers
who
were
so
soon
to
show
themselves
cowards
the
morning
was
dark
sultry
and
lowering
general
herkimer
troops
composed
chiefly
of
the
militia
regiments
of
colonels
cox
paris
visscher
and
klock
were
quite
undisciplined
and
their
order
of
march
was
irregular
and
without
precaution
the
contentions
of
the
morning
had
delayed
their
advance
until
about
nine
and
the
hard
feelings
which
existed
between
the
commander
and
some
of
his
officers
caused
a
degree
of
insubordination
which
proved
fatal
in
its
consequences
a
deep
ravine
crossed
the
path
of
herkimer
in
a
north
and
south
direction
extending
from
the
high
grounds
on
the
south
to
the
river
and
curving
toward
the
east
in
semicircular
form
the
bottom
of
this
ravine
was
marshy
and
the
road
crossed
it
by
means
of
a
causeway
of
earth
and
logs
on
each
side
of
the
ravine
the
ground
was
nearly
level
and
heavily
timbered
a
thick
growth
of
underwood
particularly
along
the
margin
of
the
ravine
favored
the
concealment
of
the
enemy
all
the
colonels
of
this
small
army
were
on
horseback
a
fact
which
caused
me
no
little
astonishment
for
i
had
heard
my
uncle
say
again
and
again
and
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
he
was
a
brave
and
skilful
soldier
that
the
man
who
went
in
the
saddle
to
meet
savages
was
courting
his
own
death
so
great
was
my
indignation
against
these
men
who
had
badgered
the
commander
that
i
mentally
hugged
myself
with
delight
because
of
their
folly
not
only
in
thus
riding
but
in
moving
the
column
without
scouts
ahead
to
learn
the
whereabouts
of
the
enemy
or
to
ascertain
what
might
be
in
front
of
or
on
either
side
of
them
it
is
true
that
colonel
visscher
regiment
was
detailed
as
a
and
i
question
if
even
such
a
precaution
would
have
been
taken
but
for
the
fact
that
the
provision
and
ammunition
wagons
which
were
not
able
to
move
at
as
rapid
a
pace
as
the
men
needed
something
in
the
way
of
protection
it
was
not
until
we
had
advanced
half
a
mile
or
more
that
i
bethought
myself
of
the
position
in
the
column
which
sergeant
corney
and
i
occupied
because
of
attempting
to
follow
general
herkimer
closely
in
event
of
an
ambush
being
prepared
for
our
reception
and
i
confidently
expected
that
such
would
be
the
case
after
the
sentinel
had
seen
indians
lurking
nearabout
the
camp
we
two
would
be
in
a
most
dangerous
position
and
i
made
mention
of
that
which
was
in
my
mind
to
the
sergeant
ay
lad
you
may
be
right
an
yet
i
am
questionin
whether
we
shall
be
any
worse
off
here
than
further
in
the
rear
for
if
it
so
be
thayendanega
sneaks
count
on
ambushin
us
i
can
tell
you
to
a
dot
just
where
it
be
done
they
will
let
this
gang
of
men
you
ca
call
soldiers
after
what
we
have
seen
get
well
into
the
ravine
before
any
attack
consequently
it
will
be
about
the
centre
of
the
line
that
suffers
most
you
mean
that
if
trouble
comes
it
will
be
at
the
ravine
over
which
is
the
causeway
ay
lad
an
there
no
question
about
our
gettin
it
hot
there
chapter
viii
the
ambush
i
am
willing
to
confess
that
i
grew
more
and
more
frightened
as
we
neared
the
ravine
and
but
for
the
disgraceful
scenes
of
insubordination
which
occurred
earlier
in
the
morning
i
would
have
cried
out
against
the
folly
of
thus
going
blindly
into
such
trap
as
thayendanega
murderers
had
probably
prepared
for
us
as
it
was
however
i
would
not
let
these
mutinous
men
who
called
themselves
soldiers
see
that
we
from
cherry
valley
would
question
a
commander
orders
whatever
might
be
the
situation
and
i
held
my
peace
but
with
much
effort
and
inward
fear
there
was
little
attempt
made
by
these
representatives
of
the
tryon
county
militia
to
hold
in
military
formation
during
the
march
each
man
trying
to
outstrip
his
neighbor
as
if
this
advance
upon
a
foe
of
superior
strength
could
have
no
more
serious
consequences
than
that
some
might
be
left
behind
and
when
one
of
the
company
came
up
to
my
side
with
words
of
complaint
because
the
general
would
not
move
faster
than
a
walk
i
said
angrily
it
can
make
but
little
difference
if
you
are
not
killed
at
the
first
volley
for
the
savages
will
have
ample
time
to
finish
us
all
off
after
we
have
walked
into
their
trap
so
you
are
one
of
the
eh
the
man
cried
with
a
sneer
and
my
anger
was
too
great
to
permit
of
my
making
reply
but
sergeant
corney
who
had
heard
the
insulting
words
said
sharply
you
may
talk
to
that
lad
about
bein
after
you
have
shown
the
courage
he
has
within
the
past
four
an
twenty
hours
you
an
your
mutinous
comrades
prate
loudly
of
bravery
when
there
is
no
enemy
in
sight
but
i
lay
odds
that
not
one
out
of
an
hundred
like
you
would
dare
go
alone
from
here
to
the
fort
oh
you
are
the
messengers
who
claim
that
colonel
gansevoort
asked
us
to
remain
idle
until
he
should
give
the
signal
eh
the
fellow
said
in
an
offensive
tone
and
sergeant
corney
raised
his
rifle
clubwise
as
if
to
strike
him
down
but
held
his
hand
as
he
said
slowly
and
in
a
tone
which
was
full
of
menace
but
that
you
are
already
so
near
your
death
at
the
hands
of
the
enemy
i
would
make
certain
you
never
again
questioned
my
word
we
did
go
to
the
fort
while
you
were
engaged
in
the
manly
sport
of
badgerin
your
commander
an
old
soldier
who
knows
his
business
an
had
you
been
with
us
it
is
certain
you
never
made
the
attempt
to
get
back
go
on
to
your
death
you
fool
an
i
hope
it
do
come
so
soon
but
that
you
have
time
to
realize
you
did
all
in
your
power
to
bring
it
about
the
more
speedily
by
this
time
we
were
well
within
the
ravine
which
has
already
been
described
and
the
old
soldier
had
hardly
ceased
speaking
when
from
amid
the
foliage
ahead
and
on
every
side
came
a
circle
of
fire
like
unto
the
lightning
flash
followed
by
the
crackling
of
firearms
which
served
to
drown
the
from
every
portion
of
our
lines
we
had
marched
like
children
into
the
ambush
and
on
the
instant
a
blind
rage
took
possession
of
me
because
i
had
followed
the
mutineers
when
i
knew
full
well
to
what
they
were
hastening
even
as
the
flashes
of
light
sprang
out
from
among
the
leaves
i
saw
colonel
cox
he
who
was
responsible
for
all
that
flood
of
death
leap
high
in
the
air
only
to
fall
back
dead
and
at
the
same
moment
general
herkimer
horse
reared
and
screamed
in
a
it
was
as
if
every
second
man
of
the
command
fell
before
that
withering
fire
and
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
of
groans
screams
and
savage
could
be
heard
shouts
behind
us
telling
that
the
who
a
few
moments
previous
were
prating
of
their
bravery
had
turned
and
fled
like
cowards
that
they
were
more
than
the
would
have
beat
a
retreat
at
that
moment
but
for
the
fact
that
the
hemmed
us
in
so
that
flight
was
impossible
it
seemed
as
if
i
lived
a
full
hour
during
the
terrible
ten
seconds
that
elapsed
after
the
first
volley
was
fired
by
the
hidden
foe
and
then
i
heard
sergeant
corney
crying
in
my
ear
his
voice
sounding
as
if
afar
off
it
is
for
you
an
i
lad
to
look
after
the
general
he
is
wounded
then
it
was
that
i
realized
the
commander
was
pinned
to
the
earth
by
his
dead
horse
and
without
being
really
conscious
of
my
movements
i
ran
to
his
side
the
old
soldier
and
i
had
no
more
than
bent
over
general
herkimer
to
learn
how
we
could
best
release
him
from
his
dangerous
position
when
a
second
volley
came
from
amid
the
foliage
and
those
alleged
soldiers
of
the
command
who
were
yet
alive
ran
wildly
to
and
fro
like
frightened
chickens
seeking
some
way
of
escape
rather
than
standing
up
like
men
to
battle
for
their
own
lives
without
really
seeing
it
i
was
conscious
that
all
this
was
taking
place
around
us
and
then
i
heard
sergeant
corney
say
to
the
general
in
a
tone
that
a
bad
wound
in
your
knee
sir
ay
but
there
no
time
to
think
of
ourselves
just
now
the
cowards
must
be
brought
to
their
senses
or
every
one
of
them
will
be
shot
down
was
the
reply
of
the
man
whom
his
own
soldiers
had
taunted
with
cowardice
not
an
hour
previous
acting
under
sergeant
corney
commands
for
the
old
man
was
as
cool
as
if
he
had
been
born
amid
just
such
scenes
of
carnage
i
helped
raise
the
body
of
the
horse
until
it
was
possible
for
general
herkimer
to
roll
himself
out
from
beneath
the
dead
animal
and
while
we
worked
to
aid
him
the
commander
was
crying
to
his
men
to
stand
firm
if
they
would
save
their
own
lives
rally
there
he
shouted
yet
lying
unable
to
move
upon
the
ground
stand
firm
and
we
yet
have
a
good
chance
of
holding
our
own
all
the
while
sergeant
corney
and
i
worked
over
him
he
continued
to
cheer
the
frightened
men
until
by
the
time
we
had
dragged
him
to
where
he
could
sit
upright
with
his
back
against
a
huge
tree
placing
his
saddle
beneath
him
to
serve
as
a
prop
the
men
were
beginning
to
understand
that
the
only
chance
for
life
was
to
fight
desperately
the
wagons
in
the
rear
and
the
horde
of
savages
which
had
closed
in
upon
us
prevented
any
save
those
who
had
first
fled
from
retreating
and
by
the
time
a
full
third
of
the
command
had
been
killed
or
disabled
the
remainder
understood
that
it
would
be
well
to
turn
to
the
man
they
had
so
lately
reviled
for
possible
safety
sergeant
corney
and
i
gave
no
heed
to
what
was
going
on
around
us
until
we
had
bound
up
the
general
knee
in
such
a
manner
that
there
was
no
longer
danger
he
would
bleed
to
death
and
when
this
had
been
done
i
noted
that
our
people
had
taken
shelter
behind
the
trees
where
they
could
strike
a
blow
in
their
own
defence
the
indians
understanding
that
the
first
daze
of
terror
had
passed
away
leaving
their
intended
victims
in
condition
to
do
considerable
execution
fell
back
a
short
distance
to
where
they
could
find
shelter
and
thus
thanks
to
general
herkimer
it
was
no
longer
a
massacre
but
a
battle
when
sergeant
corney
and
i
had
done
all
we
could
to
render
the
commander
more
comfortable
we
took
our
share
in
the
fight
remaining
close
beside
general
herkimer
meanwhile
lest
the
indians
make
an
attempt
to
take
him
prisoner
within
half
an
hour
from
the
time
the
first
volley
had
been
fired
our
people
were
doing
good
execution
and
yet
the
enemy
line
was
closing
in
upon
us
slowly
but
surely
tire
out
lads
the
general
shouted
encouragingly
you
never
yet
saw
a
painted
snake
who
could
take
much
punishment
an
it
only
a
question
of
holding
your
own
awhile
longer
make
every
bullet
count
for
although
we
have
ammunition
in
plenty
there
is
no
good
reason
why
we
should
waste
any
then
the
commander
most
likely
in
order
to
set
his
men
an
example
of
coolness
rather
than
because
he
needed
the
fumes
of
tobacco
quietly
lighted
his
pipe
and
seeing
this
our
people
cheered
at
the
same
time
they
shot
down
every
form
that
was
exposed
to
view
illustration
out
lads
the
general
shouted
a
few
moments
later
general
herkimer
gave
the
word
that
our
force
form
a
circle
in
order
to
meet
the
foe
at
every
point
and
after
this
had
been
done
the
enemy
were
the
better
held
in
check
even
at
the
moment
i
was
surprised
when
i
found
myself
thinking
of
the
danger
to
which
jacob
must
be
exposed
rather
than
of
my
own
desperate
plight
while
on
the
alert
for
a
living
target
i
speculated
whether
he
was
yet
free
and
if
he
had
discovered
the
whereabouts
of
his
father
i
had
no
idea
as
to
the
flight
of
time
and
could
not
have
told
whether
we
had
spent
ten
minutes
or
sixty
in
that
struggle
for
life
when
without
warning
the
floodgates
of
heaven
were
opened
the
rain
came
down
literally
in
torrents
it
seemed
as
if
the
water
descended
in
solid
sheets
rather
than
drops
and
no
matter
how
bloodthirsty
a
man
might
have
been
he
could
no
more
have
continued
the
battle
than
if
he
had
been
in
the
river
savages
as
well
as
white
men
were
forced
to
cease
their
efforts
to
kill
and
for
a
time
we
crouched
beneath
such
poor
shelter
as
the
trees
afforded
but
drenched
to
the
skin
in
a
twinkling
general
herkimer
was
in
no
better
plight
than
those
who
were
the
most
exposed
the
fire
in
his
pipe
was
drowned
out
but
he
continued
to
hold
it
between
his
teeth
as
he
said
in
a
low
tone
to
sergeant
corney
pass
the
word
quietly
for
our
people
to
close
in
where
it
will
be
possible
to
hear
what
i
say
thus
far
i
noted
that
the
savages
have
watched
until
a
rifle
has
been
discharged
when
they
rush
up
and
use
their
hatchets
we
can
put
an
end
to
that
kind
of
butchery
the
old
soldier
did
as
he
had
been
bidden
moving
to
and
fro
without
fear
of
exposing
himself
for
the
downpour
was
so
great
that
no
man
could
have
loaded
a
musket
with
dry
powder
and
even
while
the
storm
continued
the
circle
was
contracted
until
the
commander
was
enclosed
by
a
living
hedge
then
it
was
that
orders
were
given
for
the
men
to
take
their
stations
in
couples
and
when
one
had
discharged
his
rifle
the
other
was
to
wait
until
the
indians
came
up
to
kill
the
supposedly
defenceless
soldier
when
a
second
bullet
would
be
ready
for
them
much
to
my
surprise
i
heard
general
herkimer
say
that
a
full
hour
had
elapsed
from
the
time
the
first
volley
had
been
fired
and
it
stiffened
the
courage
of
all
to
learn
that
we
had
been
able
to
hold
the
foe
in
check
so
long
immediately
the
summer
storm
had
so
far
that
the
weapons
could
be
loaded
the
battle
was
continued
raging
with
even
more
fury
than
before
as
the
enemy
tried
to
overwhelm
us
by
a
sudden
rush
and
in
a
very
few
seconds
the
painted
fiends
came
to
understand
that
it
was
no
longer
an
easy
matter
to
tomahawk
a
man
immediately
after
he
had
fired
a
shot
when
the
savages
found
that
their
tactics
were
guarded
against
it
seemed
as
if
they
lost
courage
and
gradually
fell
back
a
little
having
had
quite
as
much
of
whig
marksmanship
as
was
pleasing
because
we
could
no
longer
see
as
many
targets
before
us
the
fire
was
slackened
considerably
and
then
some
one
on
the
outer
lines
of
our
defensive
circle
shouted
they
are
bringin
up
the
tories
here
come
the
johnson
greens
although
i
was
standing
well
in
the
centre
of
our
force
it
was
possible
to
see
the
uniforms
of
that
band
of
renegades
which
sir
john
had
armed
and
equipped
that
they
might
kill
their
neighbors
as
the
men
came
up
to
take
the
place
of
the
retreating
redskins
and
if
anything
had
been
needed
to
stiffen
the
backs
of
our
people
surely
they
got
it
when
seeing
those
whom
they
had
once
called
friends
moving
into
line
to
compass
their
death
i
had
thought
that
the
men
under
general
herkimer
command
fought
bravely
after
the
cowards
were
weeded
out
and
those
who
were
left
understood
that
but
for
the
mutiny
in
camp
the
ambush
would
not
have
been
successful
but
now
they
seemed
like
veritable
tigers
as
the
tories
came
into
the
battle
there
was
no
longer
any
thought
of
fighting
from
behind
trees
but
each
man
pushed
forward
intent
only
on
vanquishing
the
renegades
until
none
save
sergeant
corney
and
i
were
left
to
guard
our
wounded
commander
i
will
set
down
here
that
account
of
the
battle
from
this
point
which
i
found
some
time
since
in
a
book
containing
the
story
of
the
fight
in
the
ravine
sometimes
called
the
battle
of
oriskany
major
watts
came
up
with
a
detachment
of
johnson
greens
to
support
them
the
savages
but
the
presence
of
these
men
mostly
refugees
from
the
mohawk
made
the
patriots
more
furious
and
mutual
resentments
as
the
parties
faced
and
recognized
each
other
seemed
to
give
new
strength
to
their
arms
they
leaped
upon
each
other
with
the
fierceness
of
tigers
and
fought
hand
to
hand
and
foot
to
foot
with
bayonets
and
knives
while
this
portion
of
the
battle
was
at
its
height
we
suddenly
heard
the
reports
of
firearms
from
the
direction
of
the
fort
and
my
heart
leaped
into
my
throat
for
i
understood
that
colonel
gansevoort
was
making
the
sortie
for
which
we
should
have
waited
nor
was
i
the
only
one
who
thus
realized
that
the
britishers
and
their
painted
allies
were
at
the
end
of
their
rope
so
far
as
this
fight
in
the
ravine
was
concerned
for
our
people
pressed
the
foe
yet
more
hotly
and
in
a
short
time
the
savages
raised
the
cry
of
oonah
oonah
which
told
that
they
had
had
enough
of
the
battle
so
far
as
my
experience
goes
and
i
have
had
considerable
from
first
to
last
indians
are
only
brave
when
they
have
the
advantage
but
let
the
tide
turn
against
them
and
they
are
veriest
cowards
hemmed
in
as
we
were
our
ranks
thinned
by
death
and
the
desertion
of
the
it
should
have
been
possible
for
the
enemy
to
cut
us
down
to
a
man
and
yet
the
retreating
cry
of
the
savages
sufficed
to
send
all
that
force
back
to
the
encampment
leaving
us
in
possession
of
the
field
even
though
we
might
not
rightly
be
called
victors
some
of
our
people
upon
whom
the
fever
of
battle
had
fastened
more
firmly
would
have
pursued
the
cowards
even
though
it
might
have
been
to
come
directly
upon
the
main
army
who
were
then
doubtless
engaged
in
checking
the
sortie
from
the
fort
but
general
herkimer
sent
a
squad
of
the
cooler
soldiers
after
them
with
the
result
that
the
valiant
johnson
greens
were
allowed
to
continue
their
retreat
unmolested
and
it
was
high
time
we
had
a
more
than
two
hundred
of
general
herkimer
force
lay
dead
among
the
trees
while
even
a
larger
number
were
so
seriously
wounded
as
to
be
unable
to
defend
themselves
therefore
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
act
in
concert
with
those
who
were
making
the
sortie
and
the
commander
issued
orders
to
fall
back
the
contents
of
the
were
thrown
out
to
make
room
for
our
wounded
and
while
the
uproar
of
the
battle
near
the
fort
rang
in
our
ears
we
retreated
from
that
valley
of
death
now
those
who
had
raised
their
voices
against
the
general
accusing
him
of
cowardice
did
all
within
their
power
to
make
atonement
by
their
care
of
him
and
willing
hands
bore
him
on
a
litter
that
he
might
be
spared
the
pain
of
transportation
in
the
lumbering
wagons
it
was
a
sorry
train
that
left
the
ravine
not
stopping
to
bury
the
dead
because
of
the
certainty
that
leger
army
would
come
to
finish
the
bloody
work
as
soon
as
the
force
from
the
fort
had
been
driven
back
and
when
it
was
in
motion
sergeant
corney
gripped
me
by
the
arm
as
he
said
our
road
is
not
in
that
direction
lad
yonder
men
may
take
the
repose
which
they
do
not
deserve
after
havin
brought
about
all
this
disaster
but
we
must
face
danger
once
more
an
perhaps
for
the
last
time
meanin
that
we
to
go
back
in
search
of
jacob
i
asked
feeling
for
the
moment
as
if
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
voluntarily
turn
my
face
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
now
that
i
was
no
longer
animated
by
the
fever
of
battle
ay
lad
our
duty
is
now
toward
him
havin
done
all
we
may
under
general
herkimer
command
as
i
figger
it
we
free
to
do
as
we
choose
for
we
can
no
longer
aid
those
who
are
goin
back
when
but
for
rankest
mutiny
they
might
have
entered
the
fort
amid
the
cheers
of
victory
if
colonel
gansevoort
is
forced
to
surrender
it
can
all
be
set
down
to
the
credit
of
those
who
howled
so
loudly
this
mornin
that
they
could
march
straight
through
the
enemy
lines
there
is
little
hope
we
can
find
jacob
after
so
long
a
time
has
passed
i
said
thinking
of
the
perils
that
must
necessarily
await
us
while
we
tried
to
make
our
way
through
thayendanega
camp
i
grant
you
that
lad
an
yet
we
are
bound
to
make
the
venture
or
let
it
be
said
that
we
deserted
a
comrade
when
he
needed
us
we
did
that
same
when
we
pressed
on
toward
the
fort
i
suggested
feebly
ay
an
because
we
were
in
duty
bound
to
carry
the
general
message
now
that
work
has
been
done
we
are
free
i
could
not
well
say
anything
more
against
his
plan
without
laying
myself
open
to
a
charge
of
cowardice
and
at
that
moment
i
really
was
a
coward
therefore
i
stood
ready
to
follow
him
there
were
provisions
in
plenty
strewn
on
the
ground
having
been
thrown
out
of
the
wagons
to
make
room
for
the
wounded
and
from
such
store
sergeant
corney
gathered
up
as
much
as
would
serve
us
during
four
and
twenty
hours
this
we
stuffed
into
the
pockets
of
our
shirts
filled
our
and
from
the
ammunition
on
the
dead
bodies
and
then
we
were
ready
to
leave
that
valley
of
death
all
this
while
it
was
possible
to
hear
the
din
of
that
battle
which
was
being
fought
near
the
fort
but
as
we
advanced
it
became
evident
that
the
conflict
was
subsiding
it
would
have
been
folly
for
the
besieged
to
do
other
than
beat
a
retreat
when
it
could
be
seen
that
general
herkimer
men
were
not
in
a
position
to
take
advantage
of
the
sortie
and
as
soon
as
might
be
the
brave
fellows
sought
the
shelter
of
the
fort
once
more
leaving
twenty
of
their
comrades
between
the
lines
as
victims
of
the
mutiny
among
the
tryon
county
militiamen
much
to
my
surprise
sergeant
corney
appeared
sadly
disappointed
when
the
tumult
of
battle
died
away
and
i
asked
if
he
believed
that
the
people
from
the
fort
should
have
made
an
attempt
to
inflict
more
punishment
upon
the
enemy
not
a
bit
of
it
lad
the
old
soldier
replied
promptly
they
have
already
done
more
than
could
have
been
expected
but
yet
i
had
a
hope
that
the
scrimmage
would
have
lasted
a
bit
longer
why
i
asked
in
surprise
because
we
stand
a
better
chance
of
circlin
around
to
where
we
left
jacob
while
the
villains
have
somethin
to
keep
busy
now
there
no
longer
any
need
to
fight
they
likely
keep
sharper
watch
yet
i
count
that
peter
sitz
if
they
have
killed
him
already
has
a
bigger
show
of
livin
a
spell
longer
than
he
had
last
night
why
because
it
stands
to
reason
that
thayendanega
beauties
have
taken
more
than
one
prisoner
an
will
have
a
better
supply
of
livin
material
for
the
stake
than
before
peter
may
be
lucky
enough
to
keep
his
hair
a
spell
longer
but
there
be
many
a
poor
wretch
who
taste
of
torture
this
night
an
perhaps
jacob
may
be
one
of
them
i
cried
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
and
from
that
moment
it
was
not
necessary
the
old
soldier
urge
me
forward
for
i
burned
with
the
desire
to
do
all
i
might
to
find
our
comrade
before
it
should
be
too
late
when
we
left
the
ravine
in
search
of
the
lad
it
was
necessary
we
advance
over
much
the
same
course
as
when
we
carried
general
herkimer
message
and
it
was
slightly
in
our
favor
that
we
knew
fairly
well
at
how
great
a
distance
from
the
general
encampment
of
the
enemy
we
must
keep
in
order
to
avoid
running
into
the
indians
then
again
it
seemed
probable
we
had
a
better
chance
of
making
our
way
around
this
circle
than
when
we
first
traversed
it
because
just
at
this
time
thayendanega
villains
had
received
such
a
drubbing
at
the
hands
of
the
patriots
as
would
most
likely
prevent
them
from
having
any
keen
desire
to
come
upon
more
white
men
it
was
also
probable
as
sergeant
corney
had
suggested
that
they
had
taken
a
number
of
prisoners
during
the
fight
with
the
garrison
of
the
fort
as
well
as
at
the
ravine
and
the
murderous
scoundrels
would
be
so
occupied
with
making
preparations
for
torturing
such
poor
unfortunates
as
to
neglect
their
duties
as
leger
allies
when
i
had
thus
viewed
the
situation
it
did
not
appear
such
a
difficult
matter
for
us
to
gain
a
station
to
the
southward
of
encampment
but
coming
across
jacob
was
quite
a
different
proposition
finding
a
needle
in
a
seemed
much
more
simple
than
running
upon
a
lad
who
was
doing
his
best
to
remain
hidden
from
view
unless
perchance
he
had
already
been
captured
it
ai
any
easy
job
figger
as
you
will
sergeant
corney
said
when
i
had
put
the
situation
before
him
from
my
point
of
view
but
i
that
we
goin
to
come
somewhere
near
succeedin
we
can
count
on
pretty
much
as
we
please
from
now
till
mornin
providin
we
do
stick
our
noses
into
the
camps
of
the
britishers
or
tories
for
you
can
set
it
down
as
a
fact
that
every
wretch
will
have
considerable
on
hand
this
night
the
only
trouble
will
be
that
we
may
have
to
keep
within
cover
while
they
torturin
some
poor
fellow
under
our
very
shadows
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
peter
an
jacob
sitz
are
the
only
white
men
we
after
an
shut
both
eyes
an
ears
to
every
one
else
suppose
jacob
has
been
made
prisoner
would
you
risk
your
life
to
save
him
the
old
man
made
no
reply
until
i
had
repeated
the
question
and
then
he
said
slowly
if
there
was
any
show
of
bein
able
to
work
the
trick
you
could
count
on
me
to
the
end
but
if
he
fallen
into
their
clutches
unless
some
wonderfully
big
turn
of
affairs
comes
in
our
path
we
would
be
only
throwin
away
the
lives
of
both
without
chance
of
helpin
him
i
heard
boasters
tellin
how
they
rescued
a
prisoner
from
an
indian
camp
but
i
never
believed
anything
of
the
kind
for
it
ai
to
be
done
more
one
time
in
a
thousand
an
then
you
have
to
find
a
lot
of
idjuts
to
work
on
sergeant
corney
had
used
a
good
many
words
in
replying
to
my
short
question
and
i
believed
he
had
done
so
to
the
end
that
i
might
not
fully
understand
what
he
meant
as
i
made
it
out
however
he
would
turn
his
back
on
poor
jacob
in
case
the
savages
had
him
in
their
power
and
i
asked
myself
again
and
again
what
course
i
should
pursue
in
such
a
situation
we
made
a
long
détour
around
the
in
order
to
avoid
as
much
as
possible
the
danger
of
stumbling
upon
the
enemy
scouts
and
when
the
afternoon
was
had
come
as
nearly
as
we
could
guess
to
a
point
due
south
from
thayendanega
camp
how
far
do
you
reckon
we
are
from
leger
force
i
asked
when
sergeant
corney
threw
himself
on
the
ground
within
shelter
of
a
clump
of
bushes
as
if
for
a
long
halt
three
miles
or
more
from
their
lines
of
sentinels
if
they
got
any
out
an
we
none
too
far
away
to
my
figgerin
after
sunset
we
work
in
toward
but
there
need
be
any
hurry
for
reckonin
that
we
do
want
to
do
much
work
till
after
midnight
if
jacob
is
still
free
to
do
as
he
pleases
there
little
danger
he
come
to
grief
now
an
mornin
unless
he
should
see
them
torturin
his
father
an
then
it
certain
he
make
a
fight
no
matter
how
great
the
odds
against
him
i
suggested
thinking
of
what
i
would
be
tempted
to
do
under
similar
circumstances
in
that
case
we
better
off
where
we
are
i
do
allow
that
a
lad
has
any
right
to
deliberately
throw
away
his
own
life
an
that
what
jacob
would
be
doin
if
he
showed
himself
when
the
villains
had
his
father
at
the
stake
he
could
stand
still
an
see
it
done
true
for
you
but
no
matter
how
he
might
feel
it
his
duty
to
think
of
his
mother
an
surely
she
would
say
that
it
was
better
one
came
home
than
for
both
to
be
killed
it
a
mighty
hard
outlook
i
said
with
a
sigh
you
right
an
at
the
same
time
you
ai
makin
matters
any
better
by
chewin
it
over
a
man
do
fit
himself
for
a
fight
by
figgerin
out
all
the
possible
horrors
an
you
think
we
have
a
fight
before
this
venture
is
ended
i
leave
it
to
you
if
somethin
of
the
kind
do
seem
reasonable
the
old
man
replied
grimly
and
then
he
set
about
making
a
dinner
from
the
supply
of
provisions
we
had
found
in
the
ravine
after
that
i
made
no
more
effort
to
keep
up
a
conversation
and
tried
very
hard
to
force
from
my
mind
any
speculations
regarding
jacob
and
his
father
but
with
poor
success
it
seemed
as
if
every
subject
had
some
bearing
upon
the
matter
and
so
disagreeable
was
the
constant
harking
back
to
what
was
beyond
my
control
that
i
really
felt
glad
when
the
shadows
of
night
began
to
lengthen
for
almost
any
kind
of
action
was
better
than
remaining
there
in
hiding
eating
one
heart
out
sergeant
corney
gave
no
sign
that
he
realized
night
had
come
until
i
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
and
then
he
said
ay
lad
the
time
is
drawin
nigh
but
i
reckon
that
we
be
wise
to
hold
on
as
we
are
a
spell
longer
then
he
lay
back
as
if
bent
on
going
to
sleep
and
i
held
my
peace
determined
to
say
no
more
even
though
he
remained
there
until
sunrise
it
must
have
been
ten
before
he
showed
signs
of
life
and
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
as
he
said
i
allow
that
we
better
be
movin
though
there
ai
any
great
need
of
hurryin
we
be
able
to
cover
three
miles
in
an
hour
an
even
then
be
a
bit
early
for
good
work
how
will
you
set
about
findin
jacob
i
asked
giving
words
to
the
question
which
had
been
in
my
mind
ever
since
we
came
to
a
halt
our
only
chance
is
to
keep
movin
nearabout
thayendanega
camp
trustin
to
accident
for
comin
across
him
sergeant
corney
strapped
his
rifle
on
his
back
as
if
believing
he
would
have
no
use
for
it
but
he
made
certain
his
knife
was
loose
in
its
sheath
and
i
understood
that
if
we
had
trouble
it
would
be
at
close
quarters
at
last
we
were
ready
and
this
time
the
sergeant
did
not
propose
that
i
lead
the
way
he
strode
off
in
advance
with
never
a
glance
backward
to
see
if
i
was
following
and
in
silence
we
went
on
toward
the
at
a
swift
pace
until
the
old
man
halted
to
say
in
a
whisper
there
should
be
sentinels
nearabout
unless
thayendanega
believes
he
has
killed
all
the
decent
men
in
the
mohawk
valley
so
have
your
wits
about
you
lad
for
a
mistake
now
will
cost
us
dearly
chapter
ix
the
indian
camp
i
claim
that
it
is
nothing
to
my
discredit
when
i
say
that
there
was
a
great
fear
in
my
heart
while
we
advanced
at
a
snail
pace
after
having
come
to
that
point
where
we
might
reasonably
expect
the
indian
sentinels
would
be
posted
in
the
darkness
moving
amidst
the
dense
foliage
where
it
required
the
utmost
care
to
avoid
betraying
one
whereabouts
advancing
blindly
into
you
knew
not
what
peril
was
well
calculated
to
make
even
the
most
courageous
feel
a
bit
timid
at
any
moment
we
might
literally
stumble
over
a
party
of
warriors
in
such
numbers
that
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
making
our
escape
and
in
case
we
should
come
face
to
face
with
no
more
than
four
or
five
of
the
enemy
it
would
be
useless
to
show
fight
because
of
the
hundreds
everywhere
around
who
could
be
summoned
to
the
assistance
of
their
comrades
before
we
had
advanced
an
hundred
paces
i
became
convinced
that
it
was
impossible
we
should
be
able
to
reconnoitre
the
camp
and
return
to
the
point
from
where
we
had
set
out
without
being
killed
or
what
was
worse
taken
prisoner
and
yet
had
i
known
for
a
certainty
that
such
fate
awaited
us
i
would
not
have
let
sergeant
corney
know
of
my
unwillingness
to
follow
him
sorely
did
i
blame
jacob
for
having
forced
us
into
such
a
position
of
danger
when
there
was
little
hope
any
good
could
be
effected
by
our
coming
and
more
than
once
i
promised
myself
that
if
by
any
fortunate
chance
i
succeeded
in
arriving
at
cherry
valley
again
no
one
could
tempt
me
to
leave
it
it
was
useless
however
to
mourn
over
what
could
not
be
cured
we
had
come
there
voluntarily
and
unless
both
of
us
were
willing
to
write
ourselves
down
as
cowards
must
perform
the
task
it
was
midnight
before
we
heard
anything
of
the
enemy
and
then
a
faint
hum
of
voices
in
the
distance
told
that
sergeant
corney
had
led
the
way
truly
and
wonderfully
well
never
again
would
i
say
that
he
was
not
thoroughly
versed
in
woodcraft
the
old
soldier
gripped
my
arm
to
make
certain
i
understood
that
we
had
come
near
to
the
enemy
and
then
inch
by
inch
we
moved
forward
halting
a
few
moments
every
time
we
incautiously
caused
a
rustling
among
the
foliage
illustration
three
or
four
hundred
indians
were
dancing
wildly
around
a
huge
fire
how
long
that
slow
progress
continued
i
can
not
rightly
say
but
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
morning
was
near
at
hand
when
we
were
arrived
having
miraculously
passed
such
stragglers
scouts
or
sentinels
as
might
have
been
in
the
vicinity
at
a
point
where
we
could
have
a
view
of
this
particular
portion
of
the
encampment
three
or
four
hundred
indians
were
dancing
wildly
around
a
huge
fire
while
half
as
many
more
were
feasting
preparing
their
own
food
by
cutting
it
from
the
carcasses
of
two
oxen
which
lay
near
at
hand
and
broiling
it
on
the
live
coals
i
knew
sufficient
of
savage
customs
to
understand
that
if
there
had
been
any
torturing
of
prisoners
during
the
evening
such
fiendish
work
was
at
an
end
and
that
which
we
were
witnessing
was
but
the
ending
of
the
barbarous
sport
now
it
was
that
i
mentally
thanked
sergeant
corney
for
having
delayed
so
long
before
starting
for
it
would
have
been
agony
indeed
had
we
been
forced
to
witness
the
horrible
spectacle
of
a
white
man
suffering
under
the
knives
and
by
the
fire
of
these
wolves
in
human
form
we
remained
there
stretched
out
at
full
length
on
the
ground
with
no
possibility
of
gaining
information
which
might
be
of
service
to
us
in
the
future
ten
minutes
or
more
and
then
suddenly
i
was
forced
to
exert
all
my
to
prevent
a
scream
of
fear
from
escaping
my
lips
for
what
was
unmistakably
a
human
foot
had
been
planted
directly
upon
my
leg
like
a
flash
after
i
succeeded
in
restraining
myself
from
giving
an
alarm
came
the
knowledge
i
know
not
how
that
he
who
had
stumbled
upon
me
was
no
less
frightened
than
i
and
clutching
sergeant
corney
leg
nervously
to
attract
his
attention
i
sprang
upon
the
newcomer
believing
him
to
be
some
indian
straggler
whom
it
was
absolutely
necessary
we
should
silence
in
order
to
save
our
own
lives
so
quick
had
been
my
motions
that
the
fellow
had
no
opportunity
to
get
away
save
at
the
cost
of
betraying
himself
to
us
and
by
what
seemed
to
be
the
most
fortunate
chance
i
succeeded
when
leaping
blindly
forward
in
gripping
him
by
the
throat
we
went
down
together
i
on
top
striving
most
earnestly
to
strangle
him
to
death
and
he
fighting
quite
as
strenuously
to
throw
off
my
hold
before
one
could
have
counted
ten
i
began
to
realize
that
this
stranger
who
was
at
my
mercy
appeared
quite
as
much
afraid
of
making
a
noise
as
did
i
and
involuntarily
my
grasp
was
loosened
ever
so
slightly
for
i
understood
that
had
it
been
an
indian
he
would
have
done
his
best
to
attract
the
attention
of
those
near
the
with
this
thought
came
the
knowledge
that
i
had
beneath
me
one
clad
much
like
myself
and
not
the
body
of
such
villains
as
marched
in
thayendanega
train
then
it
was
and
just
as
sergeant
corney
came
up
to
us
that
i
loosened
my
grasp
entirely
in
order
to
pass
my
hands
over
the
stranger
face
and
head
there
were
no
feathers
no
daubs
of
paint
which
should
have
been
apparent
to
the
touch
and
i
whispered
with
my
mouth
close
to
the
fellow
ear
while
yet
pinioning
his
arms
in
such
a
fashion
that
he
could
not
well
move
who
are
you
a
white
man
came
the
reply
the
words
sounding
thick
and
muffled
because
of
the
squeezing
which
the
speaker
throat
had
received
then
like
a
flash
came
to
me
that
which
i
should
have
suspected
before
it
was
my
comrade
for
whom
we
had
been
searching
that
i
was
grappling
with
and
just
as
the
old
soldier
knelt
by
my
side
knife
in
hand
to
put
an
end
to
the
struggle
i
whispered
for
the
darkness
was
so
intense
that
i
could
not
even
see
the
face
which
was
but
a
few
inches
from
my
own
are
you
jacob
sitz
ay
an
you
it
is
the
sergeant
an
noel
lad
an
right
glad
am
i
that
we
came
to
know
each
other
just
as
we
did
else
would
your
blood
have
been
on
our
hands
jacob
apparently
gave
no
heed
to
the
close
shave
which
had
been
his
so
great
was
the
delight
at
knowing
we
were
with
him
once
more
and
we
three
sat
with
our
heads
close
together
in
order
that
we
might
question
and
be
questioned
without
fear
of
betraying
our
whereabouts
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
i
asked
and
jacob
replied
softly
hangin
around
this
camp
twice
have
i
come
near
bein
discovered
of
a
verity
i
believed
when
you
clutched
my
throat
that
this
was
the
last
the
endin
of
it
all
have
you
seen
your
father
sergeant
corney
asked
and
the
lad
replied
triumphantly
ay
an
had
speech
with
him
where
is
he
in
a
lodge
near
thayendanega
an
until
there
has
been
no
great
danger
he
would
be
tortured
as
i
believe
because
of
the
promise
that
he
shall
not
be
killed
how
did
you
get
to
speak
with
him
i
asked
in
surprise
within
three
hours
after
leavin
you
i
was
hereabout
an
saw
him
that
night
i
crept
through
the
village
undiscovered
for
even
the
dogs
failed
to
bark
at
me
i
know
not
why
an
there
talked
with
my
father
as
i
now
talk
with
you
if
you
got
away
why
could
not
he
have
done
the
same
i
asked
surprised
that
jacob
should
have
succeeded
in
making
his
way
among
the
lodges
i
urged
him
to
make
the
attempt
but
he
claimed
that
there
was
no
hope
we
two
could
leave
the
village
undiscovered
first
he
was
bound
hand
foot
an
although
i
might
have
cut
my
way
through
the
lodge
to
release
him
from
the
fetters
he
forbade
it
because
of
the
risk
sayin
i
must
not
endanger
my
life
on
account
of
mother
an
insistin
that
at
some
future
time
escape
would
be
more
easy
than
then
he
ordered
me
to
go
home
at
once
providin
i
could
not
find
you
an
i
would
have
done
so
this
night
but
for
the
battle
of
the
mornin
why
did
that
stop
you
i
asked
surely
you
had
no
part
in
it
no
but
the
savages
were
so
infuriated
that
i
feared
even
thayendanega
himself
would
be
unable
to
prevent
the
wretches
from
leadin
my
father
to
the
stake
therefore
i
remained
on
watch
three
prisoners
have
been
murdered
in
a
most
barbarous
manner
but
yet
he
was
left
unmolested
in
the
lodge
have
you
somethin
to
eat
i
took
from
my
pocket
all
the
food
remaining
and
the
lad
devoured
it
like
one
famished
whereupon
sergeant
corney
asked
have
you
had
nothin
to
eat
since
we
left
you
i
gathered
some
roots
an
berries
but
not
enough
to
satisfy
my
hunger
an
yet
you
would
have
stayed
here
longer
in
danger
of
starvation
ay
until
havin
satisfied
myself
that
father
was
as
safe
as
one
can
be
who
remains
in
the
power
of
such
as
are
encamped
here
did
you
come
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
find
me
nothin
more
i
said
not
minded
to
let
him
know
that
if
he
could
show
any
reasonable
chance
of
rescuing
peter
sitz
it
was
our
purpose
to
give
him
aid
where
have
you
been
all
this
while
that
is
too
long
a
story
to
tell
now
sergeant
corney
interrupted
if
the
savages
are
not
likely
to
do
more
than
dance
from
now
till
mornin
we
may
as
well
find
a
shelter
in
which
to
spend
the
morrow
an
then
i
of
the
opinion
that
the
three
of
us
had
best
make
tracks
for
cherry
valley
as
jacob
father
advised
as
he
ceased
speaking
sergeant
corney
would
have
led
us
out
of
the
thicket
but
jacob
whispered
softly
not
half
a
mile
away
is
a
small
cave
no
more
than
a
hole
in
the
hillside
an
there
we
may
remain
hidden
durin
the
hours
of
daylight
lead
the
way
an
we
will
follow
the
old
man
said
in
a
tone
of
command
and
straightway
jacob
did
as
he
was
thus
ordered
knowing
as
the
lad
did
very
nearly
where
the
indians
might
be
found
we
advanced
with
reasonable
rapidity
until
having
come
to
the
place
of
which
he
had
spoken
it
was
indeed
no
more
than
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
so
small
that
when
we
three
were
lying
at
full
length
inside
with
our
heads
toward
the
opening
it
would
have
been
a
very
small
cat
who
could
have
found
a
chance
to
lie
down
comfortably
with
us
some
bushes
and
a
tangle
of
creeping
vines
hid
the
entrance
most
admirably
but
after
we
were
once
inside
i
questioned
to
myself
whether
we
had
not
been
reckless
in
coming
directly
to
this
place
without
taking
precautions
to
cover
our
footprints
for
should
a
savage
chance
to
see
our
trail
there
was
good
reason
for
believing
he
would
follow
it
up
however
we
were
there
and
the
mischief
might
not
be
undone
readily
therefore
i
held
my
peace
saying
mentally
that
if
sergeant
corney
and
jacob
were
satisfied
with
having
taken
no
especial
precautions
then
of
a
verity
ought
i
the
least
experienced
in
woodcraft
of
the
three
be
content
when
jacob
had
eaten
all
the
small
store
of
provisions
which
i
gave
him
without
having
apparently
satisfied
his
hunger
he
insisted
on
our
telling
him
what
we
had
done
since
he
left
us
and
i
related
the
story
much
as
it
is
set
down
here
spending
a
full
hour
in
the
recital
when
i
had
finally
come
to
an
end
the
old
soldier
proposed
that
as
soon
as
another
day
had
passed
we
should
turn
our
faces
toward
cherry
valley
for
after
receiving
the
commands
of
his
father
jacob
could
do
no
less
than
go
home
i
understood
full
well
that
the
lad
would
have
encountered
any
danger
or
suffered
every
privation
rather
than
leave
this
place
where
his
father
was
held
prisoner
even
though
there
was
little
or
no
hope
he
could
aid
him
but
yet
he
did
not
argue
against
the
plan
and
thus
was
it
settled
that
when
night
came
again
we
would
start
on
our
journey
save
for
the
fact
that
father
himself
insisted
i
should
go
no
one
could
force
me
to
leave
here
jacob
said
after
a
long
pause
and
sergeant
corney
added
soothingly
saying
that
which
i
question
if
he
himself
really
believed
you
can
do
no
better
lad
if
thayendanega
has
given
his
word
to
save
your
father
life
so
will
it
be
despite
all
the
howlin
wolves
in
his
followin
but
if
you
should
stay
here
and
be
discovered
tryin
to
rescue
him
there
is
little
doubt
that
it
would
result
in
the
death
of
both
with
that
we
fell
silent
once
more
and
i
was
right
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
sleep
jacob
insisted
that
the
old
soldier
and
i
give
ourselves
up
to
slumber
while
he
kept
guard
for
he
did
not
need
the
rest
as
much
as
we
therefore
it
was
that
i
slept
soundly
and
sweetly
until
a
full
hour
past
noon
and
when
i
awakened
the
sergeant
was
peering
out
through
the
leafy
curtain
in
front
of
the
cave
while
jacob
was
enjoying
his
turn
at
sleep
can
you
see
the
camp
i
asked
wriggling
forward
until
my
head
was
close
beside
his
and
then
it
was
not
necessary
he
should
make
reply
for
we
had
from
this
place
of
vantage
a
fairly
good
view
of
the
portion
of
leger
army
it
is
true
that
the
trees
and
bushes
screened
certain
portions
of
the
encampment
but
the
greater
number
of
the
lodges
were
in
a
clearing
and
sergeant
corney
pointed
out
to
me
that
shelter
which
jacob
had
told
him
was
the
one
where
his
father
was
confined
the
indians
were
lounging
about
lazily
some
stretched
at
full
length
sleeping
others
gathered
in
little
companies
squatting
on
the
ground
as
they
smoked
and
talked
and
not
a
few
moving
slowly
to
and
fro
but
never
one
who
appeared
to
have
any
business
on
hand
there
were
both
women
and
children
in
the
camp
which
struck
me
as
being
odd
for
when
savages
set
off
on
the
it
is
not
customary
for
them
to
take
their
families
but
i
explained
this
peculiar
state
of
affairs
to
myself
by
the
supposition
that
the
women
had
been
brought
that
they
might
do
the
work
which
is
deemed
unfitting
a
warrior
jacob
counts
on
payin
one
more
visit
to
his
father
before
we
start
sergeant
corney
said
to
me
when
having
wearied
with
gazing
at
the
scene
i
turned
away
to
what
end
i
asked
with
somewhat
of
irritation
for
it
did
not
seem
to
me
wise
the
lad
should
run
the
chances
of
capture
when
nothing
was
to
be
effected
by
taking
such
risks
only
that
he
may
speak
with
him
but
it
is
folly
i
said
sharply
it
has
been
possible
for
him
to
go
into
the
village
twice
but
of
a
certainty
it
can
not
be
done
many
times
in
safety
you
are
right
lad
an
yet
how
can
we
refuse
him
fancy
if
your
father
was
in
the
same
tight
place
an
ask
yourself
if
when
about
to
turn
your
back
on
him
perhaps
forever
the
desire
to
hold
converse
with
him
once
more
would
not
be
stronger
than
the
fear
of
disaster
to
this
i
could
make
no
reply
as
a
matter
of
course
yet
i
was
still
firmly
convinced
that
it
was
a
foolhardy
venture
if
there
had
been
a
possibility
of
his
doing
the
prisoner
any
good
then
would
i
have
said
that
we
would
stay
on
until
further
efforts
were
of
no
avail
as
it
was
however
peter
sitz
himself
had
said
it
was
wiser
for
jacob
to
go
and
surely
he
the
most
interested
and
the
most
experienced
in
such
matters
should
be
the
judge
i
held
my
tongue
even
though
rebelling
against
the
scheme
because
of
knowing
that
the
lad
was
prompted
only
by
love
and
yet
my
heart
grew
heavy
within
me
until
i
had
become
convinced
that
something
of
evil
would
follow
so
disturbed
was
i
in
mind
that
it
was
impossible
to
close
my
eyes
in
slumber
again
even
though
knowing
that
my
best
preparation
for
the
journey
would
consist
in
getting
all
the
rest
i
could
sergeant
corney
had
fallen
into
what
seemed
to
me
a
moody
silence
i
looked
out
now
and
then
at
the
painted
forms
of
those
human
wolves
who
would
lay
waste
our
happy
valley
and
wished
most
fervently
that
i
had
the
power
to
destroy
them
all
with
one
blow
when
one
has
seen
as
have
i
women
and
children
butchered
in
the
most
fiendish
manner
which
a
wicked
man
can
devise
he
can
not
consider
bloodthirsty
the
person
who
would
if
he
could
wipe
out
the
entire
race
it
would
only
be
an
act
of
mercy
to
the
colonists
who
lived
in
momentary
fear
not
so
much
of
sudden
death
as
of
barbarous
torture
jacob
slept
until
nightfall
and
when
he
awakened
the
first
thought
in
his
mind
was
to
set
off
on
his
dangerous
and
useless
venture
but
sergeant
corney
advised
that
he
wait
until
the
night
was
well
advanced
and
to
this
i
agreed
although
chafing
against
the
expenditure
of
time
because
he
would
but
have
ensured
his
own
capture
had
he
ventured
among
the
wretches
while
the
entire
encampment
was
astir
we
did
not
have
supper
for
the
very
good
reason
that
we
had
no
provisions
but
buckled
our
belts
a
bit
tighter
because
already
was
hunger
beginning
to
assail
us
as
we
waited
for
the
lengthening
of
the
night
jacob
went
over
in
detail
his
experiences
while
sergeant
corney
and
i
were
with
general
herkimer
and
this
served
to
make
the
time
seemingly
pass
more
swiftly
the
savages
evidently
had
no
fiendish
sport
on
their
programme
for
this
evening
most
likely
because
of
having
exhausted
themselves
the
night
previous
and
at
a
reasonably
early
hour
this
portion
of
leger
army
was
in
a
comparative
state
of
quietude
now
if
ever
is
the
time
when
you
can
go
lad
but
remember
that
i
advise
against
it
as
would
your
father
sergeant
corney
said
gravely
i
am
not
minded
to
argue
you
out
of
what
your
heart
is
set
upon
but
ask
that
you
give
the
matter
due
weight
before
goin
so
far
that
retreat
will
be
impossible
i
must
speak
with
my
father
once
more
jacob
said
in
a
tone
so
piteous
that
i
did
not
have
the
heart
to
make
any
protest
then
god
go
with
you
the
old
soldier
said
solemnly
and
in
a
twinkling
my
comrade
had
slipped
out
of
the
cave
being
lost
to
our
view
almost
immediately
amid
the
foliage
near
at
hand
when
we
were
thus
left
alone
a
silence
fell
upon
us
because
of
the
forebodings
in
my
heart
i
was
not
inclined
for
conversation
and
i
dare
venture
to
say
the
sergeant
held
his
peace
for
much
the
same
reason
during
half
an
hour
perhaps
we
listened
intently
fearing
each
instant
lest
we
hear
those
sounds
which
would
betoken
the
capture
of
jacob
and
then
did
it
seem
probable
he
had
succeeded
in
the
venture
at
least
so
far
as
gaining
the
village
was
concerned
regarding
him
i
had
no
further
anxiety
and
without
being
aware
that
slumber
was
weighing
heavily
upon
my
eyelids
i
fell
asleep
i
could
not
have
been
unconscious
many
moments
for
it
seemed
as
if
my
eyes
had
but
just
closed
when
i
was
aroused
by
the
pressure
of
sergeant
corney
hand
upon
my
arm
and
as
i
would
have
sprung
up
he
forced
me
down
whispering
the
savages
are
comin
this
way
an
it
looks
to
me
mightily
as
if
they
counted
on
stoppin
hereabouts
involuntarily
i
parted
the
vines
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
for
i
had
been
lying
with
my
head
close
upon
them
and
gazed
down
the
side
of
the
small
hill
where
it
was
possible
to
see
even
despite
the
gloom
of
the
night
no
less
than
ten
forms
coming
up
the
incline
as
if
following
a
trail
they
have
taken
jacob
an
he
has
told
them
where
we
are
i
said
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
not
meaning
to
cast
reproach
upon
the
lad
but
knowing
what
fiendish
means
those
wretches
employed
in
order
to
extort
information
we
would
have
heard
the
noise
of
a
squabble
if
he
had
been
captured
i
have
stood
watch
ever
since
he
left
sergeant
corney
said
decidedly
can
they
be
followin
our
trail
in
the
darkness
i
cried
and
my
companion
replied
grimly
drawing
his
rifle
nearer
to
him
it
makes
no
difference
to
us
lad
why
or
how
they
are
comin
the
question
is
whether
in
case
they
find
this
place
we
shall
fight
to
the
death
or
submit
without
resistance
it
was
a
question
i
could
not
answer
i
knew
full
well
that
we
could
not
hope
to
hold
the
cave
any
considerable
length
of
time
and
that
if
during
the
fight
we
killed
any
of
the
villains
our
end
at
the
stake
would
come
before
morning
even
though
thayendanega
himself
should
do
all
he
might
to
prevent
it
i
remained
silent
the
indians
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
each
instant
and
when
they
were
up
the
hill
within
perhaps
thirty
yards
of
the
mouth
of
the
cave
the
sergeant
said
as
if
speaking
to
himself
all
we
can
hope
for
if
we
should
put
up
a
fight
is
to
die
with
weapons
in
our
hands
for
death
in
some
form
would
come
to
us
within
a
few
hours
while
there
life
there
a
chance
meanin
that
we
had
best
give
ourselves
up
i
asked
in
alarm
ay
lad
that
is
my
idee
unless
you
can
show
me
something
better
there
was
little
time
for
reflection
already
were
the
indians
so
near
that
i
fancied
i
could
hear
them
breathing
i
knew
that
the
cave
had
no
other
outlet
than
this
one
at
which
we
crouched
but
also
that
two
determined
men
might
hold
half
an
hundred
in
check
as
long
as
their
ammunition
lasted
but
then
the
foremost
of
the
snakes
were
within
a
dozen
feet
of
us
when
i
whispered
with
tremulous
voice
it
shall
be
as
you
say
sergeant
illustration
with
upraised
hands
stepped
out
from
amid
the
screen
of
foliage
chapter
x
prisoners
i
believe
if
at
that
critical
moment
i
had
decided
it
was
best
we
hold
the
cave
against
the
foe
regardless
of
the
ultimate
consequence
sergeant
corney
would
have
done
my
bidding
but
immediately
i
declared
myself
willing
to
act
as
he
thought
best
the
old
man
threw
down
his
rifle
and
with
upraised
hands
stepped
out
from
amid
the
screen
of
foliage
into
the
very
arms
of
those
who
were
coming
up
the
slope
just
for
one
instant
there
was
in
my
mind
the
thought
that
i
might
slink
back
into
the
further
end
of
the
cave
and
possibly
escape
detection
unless
it
so
chanced
that
the
savages
knew
exactly
how
many
were
hidden
there
but
fortunately
before
there
was
time
to
do
anything
so
cowardly
a
realization
of
what
it
meant
to
thus
hang
back
when
i
had
spoken
the
words
which
sent
my
comrade
forward
came
upon
me
with
full
force
and
i
followed
him
so
closely
that
he
could
not
have
had
any
suspicion
of
that
which
for
the
merest
fraction
of
time
found
lodgment
in
my
heart
it
was
too
dark
for
me
to
see
the
look
of
triumph
on
the
faces
of
our
captors
but
i
knew
they
wore
such
expressions
because
of
the
cries
of
satisfaction
and
shouts
of
delight
which
burst
from
them
when
we
unarmed
stood
in
their
midst
i
was
satisfied
in
my
own
mind
that
they
had
seen
the
trail
even
in
the
darkness
which
had
been
made
when
we
three
entered
the
cave
or
by
jacob
as
he
went
out
and
had
followed
it
rather
from
curiosity
than
the
belief
that
white
men
were
in
the
vicinity
this
idea
of
mine
although
there
was
in
it
nothing
favoring
to
us
gave
me
no
little
relief
of
mind
for
it
led
to
the
conclusion
that
jacob
was
yet
free
after
the
first
outburst
of
rejoicing
at
having
taken
two
captives
at
a
time
and
in
a
place
where
they
least
expected
to
find
them
the
indians
set
about
securing
us
in
the
most
businesslike
manner
some
one
of
the
party
brought
strips
of
rawhide
by
which
our
hands
and
arms
were
bound
tightly
to
our
sides
and
with
so
large
a
surrounding
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
escape
even
had
we
been
unfettered
they
led
us
down
to
the
village
where
we
were
greeted
by
the
squaws
and
the
children
with
fiendish
cries
of
delight
i
knew
enough
of
savage
customs
to
understand
that
we
would
be
forced
to
submit
to
a
certain
amount
of
from
the
female
portion
of
the
band
before
the
warriors
decided
upon
our
fate
and
nerved
myself
to
bear
it
as
best
i
might
realizing
that
any
show
of
weakness
at
such
a
time
would
work
to
our
disadvantage
later
we
were
tied
to
a
tree
sergeant
corney
on
one
side
and
i
on
the
other
within
twenty
paces
of
thayendanega
lodge
where
the
light
of
the
shone
full
upon
us
the
braves
of
the
tribe
seated
themselves
in
a
circle
as
if
holding
a
council
to
determine
our
fate
while
the
squaws
and
the
young
boys
amused
themselves
by
holding
stout
sticks
in
the
fire
until
one
end
was
a
living
coal
and
then
placing
these
against
our
hands
until
the
pain
was
so
great
that
only
by
summoning
all
my
strength
of
will
could
i
prevent
myself
from
screaming
even
at
such
a
time
when
our
lives
were
literally
hanging
in
the
balance
i
found
somewhat
of
comfort
in
the
thought
that
sergeant
corney
was
with
me
and
not
very
far
away
peter
sitz
could
probably
see
us
it
may
be
difficult
to
understand
why
knowledge
of
that
kind
should
serve
to
cheer
one
at
such
a
horrible
moment
and
i
myself
can
not
explain
it
it
simply
remains
a
fact
that
i
seemed
in
less
danger
of
being
murdered
than
if
i
had
been
the
only
prisoner
in
the
encampment
it
plain
that
jacob
was
not
captured
else
we
would
see
him
near
by
sergeant
corney
said
to
me
and
i
tried
my
best
to
enter
into
conversation
with
him
to
the
end
that
i
might
in
some
slight
degree
take
my
mind
from
the
torture
which
perhaps
was
but
a
foretaste
of
what
i
would
be
forced
to
suffer
he
will
be
overcome
with
grief
on
knowin
that
by
lingerin
to
speak
once
more
with
his
father
we
were
captured
an
i
fear
the
lad
may
be
led
to
some
foolishly
reckless
move
i
said
at
the
same
moment
trying
to
stifle
a
groan
if
he
will
but
stop
a
moment
to
rigger
the
matter
out
he
understand
that
only
by
keepin
clear
of
this
camp
can
he
hope
to
help
us
the
old
man
replied
and
i
asked
sharply
do
you
really
believe
sergeant
that
any
one
can
aid
us
now
tut
tut
lad
do
not
give
yourself
up
for
dead
yet
awhile
so
long
as
there
life
there
a
chance
peter
sitz
has
been
in
the
clutches
of
these
villains
many
a
day
an
yet
to
jacob
story
he
as
sound
an
hearty
as
when
he
left
cherry
valley
ay
but
his
life
has
been
saved
because
joseph
brant
knew
him
before
the
dream
of
bein
made
great
sachem
of
the
six
nations
turned
that
redskin
into
the
most
bloodthirsty
of
savages
yet
had
you
been
in
peter
sitz
place
when
he
was
first
taken
prisoner
your
despair
would
likely
have
been
as
great
as
it
seems
to
be
now
i
knew
that
sergeant
corney
would
say
many
things
which
he
himself
did
not
believe
if
he
thought
thereby
he
might
strengthen
my
courage
for
the
terrible
ordeal
which
was
probably
before
us
therefore
his
words
of
cheer
had
less
weight
than
might
otherwise
have
been
the
case
not
until
it
seemed
to
me
every
square
inch
of
my
hands
had
been
burned
to
a
blister
and
there
was
a
livid
red
mark
across
my
forehead
where
an
old
hag
had
scorched
me
with
a
burning
brand
did
the
squaws
tire
of
their
cruel
sport
and
then
we
were
left
comparatively
alone
with
sufficient
of
pain
to
keep
us
so
keenly
alive
to
the
situation
that
weariness
of
body
did
not
make
itself
apparent
we
came
to
aid
jacob
and
now
ourselves
are
standing
in
need
of
assistance
i
said
bitterly
for
this
seemed
like
the
irony
of
fate
true
for
you
lad
an
yet
we
wo
look
at
it
in
that
light
but
for
marvellous
good
luck
we
would
have
been
made
prisoners
before
this
therefore
let
us
reckon
it
simply
as
the
fortune
of
war
and
not
count
jacob
the
cause
of
our
trouble
i
would
have
replied
yet
more
bitterly
than
before
but
for
the
fact
that
at
the
moment
it
so
chanced
my
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
lodge
wherein
our
comrade
had
said
his
father
was
held
prisoner
and
i
saw
the
flap
pulled
cautiously
aside
then
the
face
of
a
man
could
be
seen
close
to
the
ground
and
i
said
eagerly
to
my
companion
who
perforce
had
his
head
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
peter
sitz
is
lookin
at
us
i
would
he
had
remained
ignorant
of
our
whereabouts
sergeant
corney
muttered
and
i
asked
in
surprise
why
because
in
addition
to
his
own
sufferin
he
must
believe
that
been
brought
to
this
plight
through
tryin
to
aid
him
an
it
only
serves
to
make
his
troubles
greater
without
lessenin
ours
sergeant
corney
was
rapidly
becoming
a
hero
in
my
eyes
for
surely
it
is
a
brave
man
who
when
he
stands
in
most
imminent
danger
can
think
rather
of
others
than
himself
we
spoke
but
little
from
this
time
on
the
sergeant
and
i
the
rawhides
which
were
tied
so
tightly
as
to
nearly
stop
the
circulation
of
blood
were
eating
their
way
into
our
flesh
and
the
pain
thus
caused
became
greater
than
the
smarting
of
the
blisters
raised
by
the
burning
brands
we
knew
that
those
who
formed
that
circle
of
painted
forms
but
a
short
distance
away
were
deciding
whether
we
be
put
to
torture
immediately
or
reserved
for
some
especial
time
of
rejoicing
and
there
grew
upon
me
such
a
fascination
as
is
sometimes
brought
about
by
keenest
peril
until
i
almost
forgot
the
desperate
situation
as
i
watched
those
who
held
our
fate
in
their
hands
trying
to
discover
from
the
expression
on
their
hideous
faces
what
might
be
the
result
of
the
conference
as
the
moments
passed
i
sank
into
a
sort
of
apathy
until
it
was
as
if
some
other
lad
fate
trembled
in
the
balance
and
i
myself
was
looking
down
upon
the
encampment
from
a
secure
place
of
refuge
the
fires
burned
dim
one
by
one
thayendanega
heathens
stalked
away
to
his
lodge
until
the
council
was
finally
brought
to
a
close
a
deep
silence
came
over
the
encampment
as
if
all
save
that
white
face
which
i
could
see
just
beneath
the
flap
of
the
lodge
in
front
of
me
and
we
two
who
were
bound
to
the
tree
were
wrapped
in
slumber
we
can
count
on
remainin
alive
at
least
until
night
sergeant
corney
said
as
if
imparting
some
cheering
information
for
these
wretches
do
not
torture
a
prisoner
in
the
daytime
unless
some
change
is
made
speedily
i
will
not
be
in
their
power
for
of
a
verity
i
am
dyin
sergeant
corney
i
said
and
he
thinking
of
course
to
cheer
me
laughed
almost
merrily
as
he
replied
nonsense
lad
you
are
a
long
ways
from
bein
dead
i
allow
your
body
is
numbed
but
that
all
if
these
strips
of
rawhide
were
slackened
a
bit
you
soon
find
yourself
feelin
as
well
as
ever
save
perchance
for
the
blisters
upon
your
hands
if
we
stretch
them
a
bit
i
cried
trying
vainly
to
change
the
position
of
my
arms
ay
but
you
ca
lad
an
by
makin
the
effort
you
only
cause
them
to
bind
the
tighter
how
that
long
night
passed
i
can
not
well
say
the
agony
of
mind
together
with
the
bodily
pain
benumbed
all
my
senses
until
i
was
like
one
in
a
trance
hearing
nothing
seeing
nothing
save
the
gleam
of
that
white
face
beneath
the
flap
of
the
lodge
where
peter
sitz
kept
mournful
watch
upon
us
the
morning
came
and
like
one
under
the
influence
of
some
hideous
nightmare
i
became
aware
that
the
savages
were
loosening
the
rawhide
thongs
faintly
with
but
little
curiosity
regarding
the
matter
i
wondered
if
we
were
to
be
killed
at
once
regardless
of
the
usual
customs
of
such
wretches
when
the
bonds
had
been
removed
the
sergeant
and
i
sank
down
upon
the
ground
helpless
unable
to
move
hand
or
foot
and
in
that
condition
we
were
dragged
into
the
lodge
where
was
jacob
father
there
we
were
bound
quite
as
securely
and
cruelly
as
before
the
thongs
cutting
fresh
welts
into
our
wrists
and
ankles
but
the
relief
caused
by
the
change
of
position
was
so
great
that
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
every
reason
for
thankfulness
here
when
our
captors
had
made
certain
we
could
not
by
any
possibility
escape
we
were
left
alone
with
peter
sitz
and
his
first
question
was
as
to
why
we
had
ventured
within
reach
of
the
enemy
sergeant
corney
minded
to
save
our
neighbor
from
the
which
might
be
his
if
he
knew
we
were
in
such
plight
through
desire
to
aid
his
son
or
himself
replied
that
we
had
been
sent
into
the
vicinity
by
general
herkimer
and
then
explained
how
we
came
across
jacob
as
well
was
the
manner
in
which
we
had
been
taken
prisoners
will
they
torture
us
to
death
i
asked
giving
words
to
that
question
which
had
been
uppermost
in
my
mind
from
the
moment
we
saw
the
painted
sneaks
approaching
the
cave
and
master
sitz
replied
with
a
painful
effort
at
cheerfulness
it
for
you
to
believe
that
they
wo
lad
remember
how
long
i
been
in
their
power
an
yet
have
come
to
no
real
harm
so
far
as
life
is
concerned
although
this
bein
trussed
up
like
a
chicken
ready
for
the
roastin
is
by
no
means
pleasant
or
comfortable
then
it
was
that
sergeant
corney
minded
as
i
now
believe
only
to
change
the
subject
of
conversation
asked
master
sitz
why
it
was
we
had
failed
to
see
him
during
the
march
from
cherry
valley
to
the
indian
village
the
explanation
was
simple
and
at
the
same
time
served
to
show
to
my
mind
at
least
that
jacob
father
would
not
be
led
to
the
stake
it
seems
that
when
he
was
first
captured
at
the
time
lieutenant
wormwood
was
killed
he
came
face
to
face
with
thayendanega
and
that
savage
recognized
him
at
once
speaking
in
such
a
friendly
tone
that
master
sitz
immediately
appealed
for
mercy
the
sachem
declared
that
if
he
remained
with
the
war
party
it
might
be
impossible
to
save
him
and
even
went
so
far
in
his
friendliness
as
to
explain
that
it
were
better
he
be
sent
ahead
to
the
indian
village
for
having
once
arrived
at
that
place
there
was
little
fear
of
the
warriors
demanding
his
death
until
on
some
especial
occasion
therefore
within
half
an
hour
after
having
been
made
prisoner
master
sitz
was
being
hurried
forward
to
oghkwaga
under
charge
of
two
savages
and
was
well
on
his
journey
before
we
started
when
immediately
after
the
interview
with
general
herkimer
thayendanega
hurried
his
tribe
on
to
join
leger
forces
he
so
far
submitted
to
the
demands
of
his
followers
as
to
allow
them
to
take
peter
sitz
on
the
with
them
more
than
once
have
the
red
devils
insisted
on
torturin
me
but
each
time
joseph
brant
has
prevented
them
although
i
question
if
he
could
have
done
so
but
for
the
unfortunate
men
who
were
captured
in
the
battle
with
general
herkimer
troops
peter
sitz
ceased
speaking
very
suddenly
and
i
had
not
the
courage
to
ask
him
how
those
prisoners
suffered
i
could
imagine
that
they
came
to
a
most
horrible
end
and
knew
that
my
worst
picturing
of
it
would
fall
far
short
of
the
reality
then
jacob
father
spoke
of
the
possibility
that
we
might
escape
with
our
lives
but
it
was
evident
he
did
so
with
an
effort
and
i
had
it
in
mind
that
he
only
tried
to
cheer
me
while
he
was
convinced
that
his
end
as
well
as
ours
would
come
at
the
stake
before
the
siege
was
finished
and
now
i
do
not
propose
to
make
any
effort
at
giving
in
detail
all
that
occurred
while
we
lay
cruelly
bound
during
a
greater
portion
of
the
time
in
this
lodge
situate
almost
in
the
centre
of
the
indian
camp
for
eight
days
we
were
kept
thus
close
prisoners
without
a
ray
of
hope
and
then
came
the
unexpected
at
least
once
in
every
hours
and
sometimes
twice
the
bonds
were
taken
from
our
arms
that
we
might
feed
ourselves
on
such
food
as
savages
cast
to
their
dogs
perhaps
thrice
in
that
long
term
of
captivity
were
we
permitted
to
walk
around
the
lodge
and
save
for
that
short
respite
from
our
suffering
i
believe
of
a
verity
we
would
have
lost
the
use
of
our
limbs
suffering
oftentimes
the
keenest
pangs
of
thirst
and
believing
that
all
this
torture
was
the
preface
to
something
yet
worse
it
can
well
be
imagined
that
we
were
indeed
a
sorry
party
even
sergeant
corney
ceased
trying
to
animate
us
for
despair
had
seized
upon
him
when
we
did
hold
converse
among
ourselves
it
was
usually
regarding
jacob
we
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
of
the
lad
since
the
hour
he
left
us
in
the
cave
to
get
speech
with
his
father
and
it
was
to
me
wondrous
strange
that
he
who
had
been
so
eager
when
there
was
but
one
prisoner
had
apparently
lost
all
desire
to
render
aid
after
two
more
had
been
captured
during
the
first
two
or
three
days
we
believed
he
was
skulking
around
somewhere
near
at
hand
with
the
vain
hope
that
he
might
be
able
to
effect
our
escape
but
as
the
time
passed
on
it
became
certain
that
such
could
not
be
the
case
otherwise
he
would
have
succeeded
in
making
his
way
to
the
lodge
as
he
had
done
when
his
father
was
the
only
occupant
of
it
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
there
was
no
more
vigilant
guard
kept
after
we
were
taken
than
before
and
the
lad
must
have
succeeded
in
getting
speech
with
us
had
he
made
the
effort
during
those
times
when
the
savages
gave
themselves
up
to
dancing
or
feasting
as
occurred
at
least
once
in
every
eight
and
forty
hours
then
we
decided
he
had
gone
in
search
of
general
herkimer
men
thinking
to
enlist
a
sufficient
number
of
them
in
our
behalf
but
if
such
had
been
the
case
we
should
have
heard
something
from
him
at
least
when
eight
days
were
passed
and
after
that
time
we
made
no
mention
of
the
lad
believing
he
had
been
discovered
near
the
encampment
and
killed
outright
and
now
it
must
be
understood
that
during
all
this
time
leger
army
was
laying
close
siege
to
fort
schuyler
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
we
closely
confined
in
that
lodge
of
skins
had
a
fairly
good
idea
of
what
was
happening
more
than
one
of
the
indians
spoke
english
and
not
unfrequently
the
tories
or
british
officers
came
to
visit
thayendanega
in
his
own
lodge
when
we
could
overhear
a
goodly
portion
of
the
conversation
thus
it
was
we
knew
that
colonel
billinger
and
major
frey
officers
from
general
herkimer
force
who
had
been
taken
prisoners
by
some
of
the
british
during
the
battle
of
oriskany
had
been
compelled
under
threats
of
torture
to
write
a
letter
to
colonel
gansevoort
misrepresenting
leger
strength
and
advising
him
to
surrender
we
also
knew
that
this
letter
written
under
pressure
was
delivered
by
colonel
butler
who
went
to
the
fort
with
a
flag
of
truce
and
when
the
commandant
flatly
refused
to
surrender
the
tory
officer
threatened
that
in
case
it
became
necessary
to
take
the
fortification
by
force
the
women
and
children
inside
would
be
delivered
over
to
the
mercies
of
the
indians
fortunately
colonel
gansevoort
was
too
brave
a
man
to
be
frightened
by
such
threats
and
when
colonel
butler
told
him
that
burgoyne
had
already
taken
possession
of
albany
he
became
thoroughly
well
convinced
that
the
officer
was
deliberately
lying
to
him
at
all
events
he
refused
to
surrender
and
two
days
later
general
leger
sent
a
written
demand
the
reply
to
which
contained
the
emphatic
statement
that
it
was
colonel
gansevoort
determined
resolution
with
the
force
under
his
command
to
defend
the
fort
to
the
last
extremity
we
learned
also
through
different
friendly
visits
which
were
paid
to
joseph
brant
by
the
officers
that
general
leger
was
continuing
the
siege
in
true
military
fashion
advancing
by
parallels
slowly
but
surely
and
it
was
the
belief
of
all
our
enemies
that
they
must
of
a
necessity
soon
succeed
in
their
purpose
the
information
which
we
thus
obtained
did
not
tend
to
make
us
feel
any
more
comfortable
in
mind
in
case
the
fort
was
taken
the
utmost
we
could
hope
for
would
be
to
escape
death
but
at
the
cost
of
remaining
no
one
knows
how
long
as
slaves
to
the
savages
if
however
the
garrison
made
such
a
resistance
as
we
believed
they
would
and
then
were
finally
overcome
the
indians
being
allowed
to
wreak
vengeance
until
their
thirst
for
blood
was
satisfied
then
was
it
probable
we
would
go
to
the
stake
with
a
goodly
company
and
little
chance
of
escape
however
i
am
not
minded
to
set
down
here
all
our
fears
one
can
readily
understand
how
many
and
great
they
were
and
how
we
twisted
and
turned
each
additional
bit
of
information
which
we
gathered
by
eavesdropping
until
it
seemed
as
if
matters
which
had
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
our
condition
were
a
direct
and
deadly
menace
i
have
said
that
we
were
eight
days
closely
confined
in
this
one
lodge
and
then
came
the
night
when
we
were
lifted
from
out
the
mire
of
despair
into
which
we
had
fallen
so
suddenly
as
to
make
us
literally
dizzy
with
hope
during
the
afternoon
of
this
day
thayendanega
warriors
had
spent
their
time
laying
on
an
unusual
quantity
of
paint
and
arraying
themselves
to
the
last
feather
of
their
finery
therefore
we
knew
that
something
of
considerable
importance
was
on
foot
when
they
marched
out
of
the
encampment
the
leading
the
way
with
the
beating
of
drums
and
blowing
of
horns
we
believed
a
council
of
war
was
to
be
held
in
which
these
wretches
most
likely
to
tickle
their
vanity
had
been
invited
to
take
part
when
just
as
they
were
setting
out
the
rain
began
to
fall
heavily
and
the
wind
to
blow
in
a
manner
which
betokened
a
summer
storm
i
found
the
wildest
delight
in
picturing
to
myself
the
discomforts
which
would
be
theirs
unless
leger
had
tents
sufficient
to
provide
them
all
with
shelter
at
another
time
i
would
have
given
little
heed
to
such
a
trifling
matter
but
now
it
seemed
of
so
much
importance
that
i
spoke
to
my
companions
in
misery
regarding
it
picturing
the
bedraggled
condition
of
the
fine
feathers
after
they
had
become
thoroughly
saturated
and
was
talking
with
more
of
animation
than
at
any
time
since
having
been
made
prisoner
when
suddenly
a
sound
as
of
some
one
scratching
on
the
skin
of
the
lodge
caused
my
heart
to
bound
until
it
seemed
positive
its
furious
beatings
could
be
heard
a
long
distance
off
it
is
jacob
i
cried
speaking
incautiously
loud
a
warning
hiss
from
peter
sitz
brought
me
to
my
senses
and
in
a
fever
of
suspense
i
listened
for
the
sound
which
had
first
attracted
my
attention
to
be
repeated
the
silence
remained
unbroken
save
for
the
lightest
rustling
of
the
skins
until
in
the
dim
light
to
which
my
eyes
had
been
so
long
accustomed
i
saw
jacob
head
and
shoulders
inside
the
lodge
it
was
only
with
difficulty
i
restrained
myself
from
crying
aloud
with
joy
for
now
it
seemed
even
surrounded
by
enemies
though
we
were
that
because
my
comrade
had
come
were
we
rescued
chapter
xi
the
escape
so
great
was
my
delight
at
seeing
jacob
slowly
working
his
way
into
the
lodge
that
there
was
no
room
in
my
heart
for
surprise
i
entirely
forgot
to
be
astonished
because
after
so
long
a
time
he
had
returned
or
to
question
why
it
was
he
dared
venture
within
the
encampment
only
the
fact
that
he
was
there
presented
itself
to
my
mind
and
i
gave
no
heed
to
anything
else
i
struggled
violently
to
reach
the
dear
lad
intent
on
throwing
my
arms
around
him
in
order
to
show
how
deeply
i
felt
this
devotion
of
his
which
had
brought
him
back
perhaps
to
a
terrible
death
but
master
sitz
and
sergeant
corney
remained
silent
and
motionless
until
jacob
was
well
within
the
lodge
then
his
father
said
conveying
reproach
even
in
the
whisper
why
have
you
come
here
after
once
having
gotten
well
away
from
the
place
you
can
do
us
no
good
an
only
hope
to
add
to
the
savages
list
of
victims
they
have
not
got
me
yet
jacob
replied
cheerily
and
i
understood
that
his
courage
had
been
greatly
stiffened
since
the
night
he
crept
out
from
the
cave
there
a
big
powwow
goin
on
over
at
leger
camp
an
no
one
is
on
guard
hereabouts
this
is
the
time
when
if
ever
you
can
escape
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
lad
talked
the
veriest
nonsense
in
speaking
of
our
escape
by
simply
crawling
away
from
the
lodge
situate
as
it
was
in
the
very
midst
of
the
encampment
but
jacob
had
the
whole
plan
in
his
mind
and
was
not
to
be
disheartened
however
much
cold
water
we
might
throw
upon
it
it
may
seem
strange
but
such
is
the
fact
that
even
when
thus
surrounded
by
danger
my
curiosity
was
so
great
that
i
asked
him
even
before
he
had
time
to
explain
how
he
hoped
to
effect
our
rescue
where
he
had
been
so
long
at
cherry
valley
he
replied
as
if
a
journey
there
and
back
was
the
most
simple
thing
imaginable
meanin
that
you
have
been
home
since
the
night
you
left
the
cave
i
repeated
in
astonishment
ay
no
less
than
that
but
why
did
you
do
it
i
cried
speaking
so
loudly
as
to
call
forth
a
warning
groan
from
sergeant
corney
because
i
believed
it
might
be
possible
for
you
to
escape
providin
we
had
help
enough
near
at
hand
he
replied
and
i
said
even
more
mystified
than
before
surely
you
could
not
expect
to
get
help
for
us
from
cherry
valley
ay
and
that
is
just
what
i
did
is
my
uncle
here
no
indeed
he
believed
my
scheme
to
be
so
wild
that
he
would
hardly
listen
to
me
and
said
you
three
had
the
same
as
come
to
your
death
already
therefore
it
was
useless
to
raise
a
finger
in
your
behalf
while
there
were
so
many
hundred
people
near
at
hand
needin
assistance
who
then
did
you
expect
would
come
to
our
aid
i
asked
and
jacob
replied
with
what
sounded
very
like
a
chuckle
of
satisfaction
who
else
save
the
minute
boys
of
the
mohawk
valley
but
for
the
rawhide
ropes
which
held
me
so
cruelly
immovable
i
would
have
leaped
to
my
feet
in
astonishment
as
it
was
i
involuntarily
gave
so
violent
a
start
as
to
cause
myself
considerable
pain
and
then
asked
in
great
heat
why
do
you
play
upon
our
hopes
so
lately
raised
by
declaring
that
the
company
of
lads
is
here
not
a
bit
of
play
about
it
noel
jacob
replied
in
so
cheery
a
tone
that
my
heart
became
wondrously
light
four
an
twenty
of
our
company
with
john
sammons
still
acting
as
captain
are
within
an
hundred
yards
of
this
lodge
an
what
is
more
we
count
on
takin
you
away
with
us
before
another
day
shall
dawn
then
it
was
as
if
jacob
believed
he
had
satisfied
our
curiosity
so
much
as
was
necessary
at
such
a
time
for
without
delay
he
moved
from
one
to
the
other
deftly
cutting
the
rawhide
which
held
us
motionless
and
three
minutes
had
not
elapsed
from
the
time
he
first
showed
himself
inside
the
lodge
until
our
limbs
were
freed
we
were
no
longer
bound
but
yet
remained
helpless
i
could
move
neither
hand
nor
foot
struggle
as
i
might
it
was
as
if
my
limbs
were
dead
while
my
body
yet
remained
alive
but
jacob
who
had
in
his
wild
plan
considered
just
such
a
probability
set
about
chafing
my
arms
and
legs
until
the
feeling
began
to
return
he
performed
the
same
office
for
sergeant
corney
i
aiding
in
the
task
before
it
was
finished
but
a
good
ten
minutes
elapsed
before
we
had
command
of
our
limbs
and
then
it
was
that
even
master
sitz
began
to
believe
it
might
be
possible
for
us
to
escape
from
the
encampment
while
he
worked
over
us
jacob
understanding
that
we
were
being
literally
overwhelmed
with
curiosity
regarding
his
movements
during
the
long
absence
explained
that
he
was
but
a
short
distance
from
the
cave
when
we
were
made
prisoners
and
at
first
almost
gave
way
to
despair
because
of
what
seemed
to
him
the
hardest
stroke
which
an
ill
fortune
could
deliver
during
that
night
he
kept
us
in
view
until
learning
that
we
would
not
be
put
to
death
immediately
and
then
the
lad
searched
in
his
mind
for
some
plan
which
might
give
promise
however
slight
of
success
he
could
not
hope
that
those
in
the
fort
closely
besieged
as
they
were
would
be
willing
to
make
a
desperate
venture
in
order
to
aid
three
men
when
so
many
hundred
were
in
peril
and
even
though
the
chances
might
be
in
favor
of
colonel
gansevoort
being
ready
to
make
a
sortie
in
our
behalf
they
were
decidedly
against
jacob
being
able
to
communicate
with
the
garrison
then
it
was
he
bethought
himself
of
the
minute
boys
who
were
not
absolutely
needed
in
cherry
valley
after
the
hundred
and
fifty
soldiers
were
quartered
there
and
without
knowing
how
they
might
be
able
to
aid
him
in
the
almost
hopeless
task
he
set
off
at
full
speed
for
our
home
travelling
by
night
as
by
day
with
no
more
halts
than
were
absolutely
necessary
in
order
to
recruit
his
strength
colonel
campbell
my
uncle
was
much
averse
to
jacob
wild
plans
he
believed
that
because
of
the
danger
which
threatened
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
mohawk
valley
it
was
in
the
highest
degree
foolhardy
to
make
any
such
effort
toward
saving
the
lives
of
three
people
as
might
jeopardize
an
hundred
times
that
number
however
while
saying
flatly
it
was
a
scheme
and
not
worthy
the
attention
of
men
he
stated
that
he
would
not
put
any
obstruction
in
the
way
of
those
who
chose
to
make
the
hazard
save
to
state
openly
that
whosoever
left
on
such
a
mission
was
but
hastening
his
own
death
it
quickened
the
sluggish
blood
in
my
veins
when
jacob
said
that
after
he
had
summoned
the
minute
boys
and
explained
to
them
in
what
peril
we
three
were
never
one
showed
the
slightest
disinclination
to
do
as
he
proposed
john
sammons
the
lad
who
was
acting
as
captain
in
my
absence
insisted
that
it
was
plainly
the
duty
of
every
member
of
the
company
to
do
whatsoever
he
might
in
our
behalf
and
the
result
was
that
the
lad
had
been
in
cherry
valley
no
more
than
half
an
hour
before
every
member
of
the
company
was
armed
and
outfitted
for
the
perilous
venture
at
the
very
last
moment
however
eight
or
ten
of
the
number
were
dissuaded
by
their
parents
but
the
remainder
started
hotfoot
for
fort
schuyler
arriving
an
hour
before
this
last
day
had
dawned
the
only
plan
which
jacob
had
formed
in
his
mind
was
to
get
speech
with
us
as
speedily
as
possible
after
arriving
then
if
needs
be
he
would
make
a
dash
upon
the
encampment
and
trust
to
the
minute
boys
fighting
their
way
out
with
us
in
their
midst
fortunately
however
he
saw
very
speedily
after
daybreak
that
something
of
import
was
taking
place
and
wisely
waited
until
it
could
be
seen
that
every
warrior
was
making
ready
for
a
grand
powwow
now
so
he
told
us
the
minute
boys
were
waiting
hardly
more
than
an
hundred
yards
distant
and
if
it
should
be
possible
for
us
to
make
our
way
through
the
encampment
to
that
point
it
was
the
determination
of
every
lad
to
fight
to
the
best
of
his
ability
with
the
hope
of
being
able
to
retreat
meanwhile
in
case
the
indians
were
aroused
he
who
would
not
have
done
his
best
at
escaping
after
all
jacob
work
and
in
face
of
the
pluck
shown
by
our
comrades
deserved
of
a
verity
to
remain
prisoner
even
until
he
was
led
to
the
stake
but
as
can
well
be
imagined
neither
of
us
three
hung
back
from
the
hazard
for
surely
it
was
better
to
die
fighting
than
be
tortured
as
thayendanega
wolves
could
torture
a
human
being
master
sitz
made
one
stipulation
however
which
was
that
jacob
should
lead
the
way
as
we
crept
out
from
the
lodge
and
in
event
of
our
attempt
at
escape
being
discovered
while
we
were
yet
within
the
encampment
the
lad
was
to
save
himself
without
giving
heed
to
us
there
shall
not
be
another
victim
added
to
our
number
jacob
father
said
in
a
tone
of
determination
strike
out
for
your
comrades
in
case
the
alarm
is
given
my
boy
and
if
we
are
taken
again
leave
us
to
our
fate
jacob
made
no
reply
to
this
but
i
believed
that
if
the
need
arose
he
would
disobey
his
father
command
without
compunction
there
was
no
time
to
linger
at
any
moment
the
powwow
might
be
brought
to
an
end
or
some
warrior
return
to
the
encampment
therefore
it
stood
us
in
hand
to
move
quickly
and
so
we
did
not
until
jacob
was
well
outside
the
lodge
did
either
of
us
three
make
any
move
to
follow
him
and
then
sergeant
corney
would
have
pushed
me
under
the
skins
which
he
raised
slightly
but
that
i
hung
back
declaring
it
was
master
sitz
place
to
go
first
but
the
old
man
forced
me
forward
how
my
heart
beat
when
for
the
first
time
in
eight
days
i
had
full
command
of
my
limbs
and
wriggled
myself
out
into
the
clear
air
it
seemed
as
if
every
movement
of
my
arms
or
legs
caused
so
much
noise
that
the
few
who
remained
in
the
lodges
must
be
alarmed
and
that
i
moved
at
even
less
than
a
snail
pace
when
every
muscle
was
being
strained
in
the
effort
to
advance
rapidly
the
perspiration
came
out
upon
my
forehead
in
great
drops
caused
not
by
the
heat
but
by
the
mental
anguish
and
again
and
again
i
said
to
myself
that
jacob
had
labored
for
naught
since
it
would
be
impossible
i
could
crawl
undetected
even
over
the
short
distance
and
when
in
my
excited
frame
of
mind
it
seemed
as
if
the
escape
was
but
just
begun
i
found
myself
in
the
thicket
amid
those
lads
who
had
been
my
playmates
since
i
could
remember
while
each
strove
to
show
in
silence
how
delighted
he
was
that
i
had
come
safely
then
ensued
another
time
of
keenest
suspense
when
we
strained
our
ears
to
hear
the
lightest
sound
which
should
betoken
that
the
squaws
of
the
encampment
had
been
alarmed
and
once
more
our
hearts
leaped
up
in
joy
as
master
sitz
came
behind
the
screen
of
bushes
now
we
had
only
to
wait
for
sergeant
corney
and
having
seen
what
he
could
do
in
the
wilderness
i
had
no
doubt
but
that
he
would
succeed
in
his
purpose
which
he
soon
did
perhaps
no
more
than
half
an
hour
had
passed
from
the
time
we
first
saw
jacob
until
we
three
so
lately
prisoners
were
surrounded
by
that
brave
band
of
lads
who
by
calling
themselves
minute
boys
had
excited
the
mirth
of
the
elders
of
cherry
valley
and
yet
never
one
who
was
not
prepared
to
sacrifice
his
own
life
for
the
welfare
of
the
others
what
are
we
to
do
sergeant
corney
said
turning
to
me
as
if
i
should
resume
command
of
this
company
of
mine
and
i
replied
promptly
with
never
a
thought
of
claiming
my
rights
as
captain
it
is
for
you
to
lead
sergeant
an
we
will
obey
there
not
one
in
this
company
so
well
fitted
as
you
to
take
us
out
from
amid
the
dangers
which
surround
us
yet
my
idea
of
what
is
safest
may
seem
to
the
rest
of
you
like
veriest
folly
he
replied
as
if
he
would
shirk
the
responsibility
and
master
sitz
said
eagerly
it
all
seems
to
me
like
a
piece
of
folly
sergeant
corney
even
though
because
of
it
are
we
brought
out
from
the
power
of
our
enemies
you
can
do
no
more
hairbrained
things
than
has
already
been
done
by
my
son
then
if
the
command
be
left
to
me
we
shall
make
our
way
into
fort
schuyler
provided
that
be
possible
fort
schuyler
i
cried
in
dismay
ay
lad
an
we
shall
be
there
before
another
day
dawns
if
we
live
provided
we
make
the
start
but
why
not
put
as
many
miles
between
us
and
this
place
as
is
possible
i
cried
with
no
slight
show
of
irritation
for
the
imminence
of
the
danger
set
every
nerve
tingling
until
i
could
think
of
nothing
save
the
most
hurried
flight
it
stands
us
in
hand
to
go
there
first
because
they
are
in
need
of
our
help
and
secondly
because
we
shall
stand
a
better
show
of
finally
escaping
from
the
savages
how
do
you
make
that
out
john
sammons
asked
and
i
understood
from
his
tone
that
he
was
not
inclined
for
the
hazard
think
you
thayendanega
wolves
will
lose
the
prisoners
whom
they
counted
on
seeing
at
the
stake
without
some
effort
to
retake
them
the
old
man
asked
sharply
and
john
sammons
replied
all
that
we
understand
but
reckon
on
puttin
a
goodly
distance
between
us
an
yonder
encampment
before
mornin
unless
there
is
an
accident
the
escape
will
not
be
known
for
many
hours
and
then
should
we
have
so
much
the
lead
that
we
could
count
with
some
degree
of
assurance
upon
gaining
cherry
valley
in
that
i
do
not
agree
lad
an
for
many
reasons
we
can
not
advance
at
full
speed
because
it
will
be
necessary
to
spend
some
time
in
whether
there
be
an
enemy
in
the
road
but
the
savages
followin
the
trail
may
come
as
fast
as
their
legs
can
bring
them
therefore
will
they
travel
three
miles
to
our
two
ay
but
we
should
be
able
to
hold
in
good
play
as
many
as
may
overtake
us
that
must
be
accordin
to
the
fortunes
of
war
it
is
hardly
to
be
reckoned
that
we
could
fight
a
pitched
battle
without
losin
some
portion
of
our
company
and
i
would
have
this
brave
rescue
of
yours
accomplished
with
as
little
cost
as
may
be
therefore
have
i
in
mind
to
enter
fort
schuyler
i
can
not
truly
say
that
sergeant
corney
convinced
us
his
plan
was
the
best
but
certain
it
is
we
were
silenced
as
was
no
more
than
proper
since
it
stood
to
reason
he
knew
best
about
such
affairs
after
this
having
made
up
our
minds
that
we
must
attempt
the
perilous
task
came
the
question
of
how
it
should
be
done
and
on
this
point
the
old
soldier
gave
us
very
little
opportunity
for
discussion
it
is
my
plan
that
we
circle
around
the
encampment
even
beyond
leger
quarters
in
order
to
get
a
general
idea
of
what
may
be
goin
on
an
havin
arrived
at
the
road
westward
of
the
fortification
you
lads
shall
get
in
hidin
while
i
try
once
more
to
open
communication
with
the
garrison
why
should
you
go
alone
i
asked
we
might
remain
in
a
body
and
thus
save
just
so
much
time
if
one
can
do
the
trick
then
may
it
be
possible
for
two
or
a
dozen
yes
to
make
one
way
across
the
open
country
i
grant
you
but
remember
lad
how
long
it
would
have
taken
to
gain
admission
when
we
were
there
before
had
the
garrison
not
been
warned
that
we
were
in
the
vicinity
this
time
they
will
look
upon
us
as
enemies
until
we
are
near
enough
to
make
ourselves
known
and
such
a
force
as
is
here
would
appear
to
them
like
an
attackin
party
the
sergeant
was
right
as
i
now
understood
full
well
and
although
i
craved
not
the
dangerous
work
because
my
comrades
were
near
at
hand
i
desired
they
should
see
that
i
shirked
not
peril
however
all
seemed
to
understand
that
if
the
sergeant
plan
was
to
be
carried
out
he
should
arrange
the
details
and
therefore
i
held
my
peace
in
order
to
gain
the
westerly
side
of
the
fort
from
the
indian
encampment
in
the
vicinity
of
which
we
then
were
and
learn
what
might
be
going
on
at
leger
headquarters
it
would
be
necessary
to
cross
the
river
and
traverse
at
least
of
a
complete
circle
around
the
fortification
much
time
might
have
been
saved
had
we
crossed
the
mohawk
to
the
southward
without
venturing
near
the
camps
of
the
british
sergeant
corney
seemed
to
consider
that
it
was
more
important
to
get
a
general
idea
of
the
disposition
of
leger
forces
before
entering
the
fort
than
to
save
ourselves
so
much
labor
therefore
he
led
the
way
eastwardly
half
a
mile
or
more
until
we
were
come
to
the
narrowest
part
of
the
river
when
we
swam
over
afterward
heading
directly
for
the
main
encampment
of
the
besiegers
still
acting
under
sergeant
corney
directions
the
greater
part
of
the
company
kept
at
a
respectful
distance
when
we
were
come
within
the
vicinity
of
leger
headquarters
while
he
jacob
and
i
crept
forward
to
reconnoitre
because
of
the
many
fires
and
the
apparent
confidence
of
the
enemy
that
no
attempt
would
be
made
to
surprise
them
we
had
ample
opportunity
to
see
all
that
was
required
the
biggest
kind
of
a
feast
or
powwow
or
council
or
whatever
it
might
have
been
called
was
in
progress
and
so
deeply
interested
were
the
britishers
tories
and
indians
alike
that
i
believe
of
a
verity
we
could
have
approached
within
fifty
feet
and
not
been
discovered
save
by
purest
accident
whatever
they
got
on
hand
seems
to
be
somethin
that
last
well
through
the
night
sergeant
corney
said
as
he
lay
amid
the
bushes
watching
the
various
groups
of
men
both
white
and
red
if
colonel
gansevoort
could
only
know
what
goin
on
at
this
minute
i
allow
make
such
a
sortie
as
would
raise
this
siege
in
quick
order
we
have
a
better
night
for
enterin
the
fort
an
if
we
do
succeed
be
our
fault
or
through
the
blundering
of
some
fool
sentinel
to
one
who
had
not
been
in
this
vicinity
as
had
i
the
old
words
might
have
induced
the
belief
that
we
were
really
not
exposed
to
danger
in
making
the
proposed
venture
but
i
knew
full
well
he
believed
as
did
i
that
however
many
might
be
feasting
and
dancing
in
the
encampment
there
were
a
certain
number
watching
the
fort
and
if
one
of
them
should
catch
a
glimpse
of
us
the
business
would
be
at
an
end
right
speedily
when
sergeant
corney
had
satisfied
himself
with
a
scrutiny
of
the
camp
he
led
the
way
to
the
northward
where
the
minute
boys
were
in
hiding
and
arriving
there
explained
in
few
words
the
situation
to
the
end
that
they
might
be
encouraged
for
that
which
was
to
come
i
question
if
after
showing
the
bravery
they
already
had
the
lads
needed
any
words
to
stiffen
their
backs
but
it
pleased
the
old
soldier
to
make
it
appear
as
if
we
had
clear
sailing
before
us
and
did
no
real
harm
then
we
started
on
the
march
which
would
be
long
because
it
was
necessary
after
passing
the
encampment
to
make
considerable
of
a
détour
in
order
to
avoid
first
a
battery
of
three
guns
then
one
of
four
mortars
and
lastly
a
battery
of
three
more
guns
all
of
which
extended
northwesterly
from
leger
headquarters
after
this
distance
had
been
traversed
we
passed
within
less
than
two
hundred
feet
of
the
line
of
trenches
which
had
been
begun
as
an
approach
to
the
fort
and
then
bore
to
the
southward
again
crossing
the
albany
road
finally
at
perhaps
two
in
the
morning
we
arrived
at
a
broad
elevation
the
easternmost
slope
of
which
came
very
near
to
the
outer
walls
of
the
fort
here
it
would
be
necessary
to
advance
without
cover
for
perhaps
an
hundred
yards
and
it
was
this
last
and
most
dangerous
work
that
sergeant
corney
insisted
on
doing
himself
my
company
found
fairly
good
in
the
thicket
near
at
hand
jacob
and
i
creeping
out
to
the
edge
of
the
foliage
in
order
to
keep
watch
upon
the
old
soldier
as
he
made
his
way
like
a
snake
over
the
plain
which
was
almost
entirely
destitute
of
vegetation
he
set
off
without
delay
for
owing
to
the
lateness
of
the
hour
there
was
no
time
to
be
wasted
and
our
hearts
were
literally
in
our
mouths
as
we
watched
him
make
his
way
slowly
along
at
imminent
danger
each
second
of
being
fired
upon
by
the
sentinels
inside
the
fort
chapter
xii
in
the
fort
everything
was
in
our
favor
on
this
night
otherwise
sergeant
attempt
would
not
have
been
the
simple
matter
which
it
appears
as
set
down
by
me
true
it
is
we
had
previously
visited
the
fort
and
that
while
many
of
the
enemy
sentinels
were
on
the
alert
but
because
a
task
has
once
been
done
is
no
proof
that
it
may
be
accomplished
a
second
time
in
fact
it
is
by
trying
a
hazardous
venture
again
and
again
that
it
becomes
yet
more
dangerous
or
in
other
words
the
pitcher
that
goes
often
to
the
well
will
one
day
return
broken
i
question
if
there
could
have
been
found
in
the
entire
mohawk
valley
a
man
who
would
have
performed
the
task
better
than
did
sergeant
corney
the
night
was
not
particularly
dark
and
we
who
were
watching
from
the
undergrowth
knew
exactly
where
to
look
for
him
but
yet
there
were
many
times
when
i
failed
utterly
to
distinguish
his
form
although
as
i
have
already
said
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
of
vegetation
to
screen
his
movements
only
when
he
himself
to
make
certain
he
was
advancing
in
a
direct
course
could
we
see
him
and
when
after
perhaps
twenty
minutes
of
such
stealthy
approach
the
deeper
shadow
cast
by
the
fortification
itself
had
been
gained
he
was
entirely
lost
to
our
view
then
was
come
the
time
when
i
feared
most
for
his
safety
although
if
the
sentinel
had
failed
to
see
him
making
his
way
across
the
open
space
we
might
have
reasonable
hope
that
the
remainder
of
his
scheme
less
dangerous
could
be
worked
without
mishap
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
an
hour
elapsed
from
the
time
he
disappeared
before
we
saw
any
sign
of
him
again
the
minutes
passed
laggingly
although
while
there
was
no
outcry
we
knew
full
well
he
had
come
to
no
harm
but
yet
i
trembled
with
anxiety
until
we
finally
saw
a
figure
upon
the
wall
waving
its
arms
and
i
said
to
jacob
that
is
the
signal
for
us
to
advance
advance
where
he
asked
in
perplexity
surely
it
is
not
possible
for
us
to
get
in
at
any
point
we
can
at
least
hold
communication
with
those
inside
if
we
creep
to
the
new
portion
of
the
fort
which
as
yet
is
only
a
stockade
the
same
place
where
the
sergeant
and
i
had
converse
with
colonel
gansevoort
it
appears
as
i
finally
learned
that
the
sergeant
believed
i
would
have
sufficient
sense
to
understand
it
was
at
this
place
we
must
effect
an
entrance
if
anywhere
and
i
ought
to
have
known
at
the
time
for
after
waving
his
arms
to
attract
attention
he
walked
along
the
wall
disappearing
near
what
was
known
as
the
which
as
yet
were
enclosed
only
by
a
stockade
of
logs
to
summon
the
minute
boys
and
bring
them
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
was
but
the
work
of
a
few
moments
and
then
was
done
that
which
i
venture
to
say
has
seldom
been
accomplished
during
such
a
siege
as
was
then
in
progress
for
an
armed
party
of
nearly
thirty
to
cross
an
open
plain
supposedly
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
enemy
sentinels
without
being
discovered
is
something
of
which
to
boast
yet
we
minute
boys
of
the
mohawk
valley
did
it
without
raising
an
alarm
when
the
foremost
of
us
among
whom
i
was
gained
that
portion
of
the
fortification
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
the
sergeant
was
lowering
a
long
ladder
over
the
stockade
and
up
this
we
clambered
without
delay
the
entire
party
getting
inside
the
fort
within
two
minutes
after
the
ascent
was
begun
what
a
time
of
congratulation
that
was
the
garrison
pressed
around
to
praise
us
and
pat
themselves
on
the
head
because
we
had
come
at
what
was
for
them
an
opportune
time
not
only
was
the
fort
reinforced
by
no
inconsiderable
number
but
we
brought
with
us
fairly
good
information
as
to
the
condition
of
affairs
in
the
enemy
camp
the
men
were
yet
praising
and
thanking
us
for
having
come
at
such
a
time
when
an
officer
approached
with
the
word
that
colonel
gansevoort
wished
to
speak
with
the
leaders
of
the
party
that
means
you
noel
the
sergeant
said
patting
me
on
the
shoulder
the
colonel
quite
rightly
believes
that
we
can
give
him
valuable
information
an
is
eager
to
have
it
but
i
am
not
the
leader
of
the
party
i
said
finding
time
to
be
a
bit
bashful
now
that
the
imminent
danger
was
passed
who
is
if
not
the
captain
of
the
company
the
old
man
asked
with
a
smile
you
an
you
always
were
when
we
were
at
home
sergeant
corney
therefore
are
you
doubly
the
leader
now
after
having
brought
us
safely
in
from
the
encampment
the
old
soldier
flatly
refused
to
present
himself
as
being
in
command
of
the
minute
boys
and
there
is
no
saying
how
long
we
might
have
wrangled
among
ourselves
had
not
colonel
willett
impatient
to
see
us
come
up
just
at
that
moment
after
asking
a
few
questions
he
settled
the
matter
by
saying
if
you
lads
who
have
accomplished
so
much
which
men
might
well
have
feared
to
attempt
are
not
willing
that
one
should
have
more
praise
than
another
let
all
those
who
have
been
in
command
at
different
times
present
themselves
to
colonel
gansevoort
and
then
mayhap
we
shall
hear
that
for
which
we
are
so
eager
i
am
free
to
admit
that
it
was
childish
in
any
of
us
to
hang
back
at
such
a
moment
but
thanks
to
colonel
willett
the
matter
was
arranged
as
he
suggested
sergeant
corney
john
sammons
jacob
and
i
going
to
the
commandant
quarters
escorted
by
the
colonel
and
the
messenger
who
had
been
sent
for
us
there
was
no
real
occasion
for
us
to
have
been
timid
regarding
the
interview
with
the
commandant
of
fort
schuyler
for
a
more
pleasantly
spoken
man
it
was
never
my
good
fortune
to
come
in
contact
with
one
would
have
said
that
he
was
interested
personally
in
each
and
every
one
of
us
from
the
questions
he
asked
concerning
our
having
organized
a
company
of
minute
boys
how
we
had
been
drilled
and
such
like
homely
matters
then
having
shown
himself
to
be
a
friend
as
it
were
he
began
getting
that
information
which
was
necessary
for
the
safety
of
the
garrison
first
he
was
eager
to
learn
regarding
the
battle
of
oriskany
for
those
inside
the
fort
knew
nothing
whatsoever
of
that
disastrous
ambush
save
such
as
could
be
guessed
by
the
reports
of
the
firearms
and
the
bearing
of
the
indians
after
they
beat
a
retreat
sergeant
corney
flatly
refused
to
tell
the
story
insisting
that
i
was
the
better
able
to
do
so
and
in
the
presence
of
colonel
gansevoort
and
all
his
principal
officers
i
related
the
events
of
that
day
when
an
able
soldier
and
a
brave
man
was
forced
by
the
prating
of
cowards
to
lead
his
soldiers
where
he
knew
almost
beyond
a
peradventure
he
had
no
hope
of
winning
a
victory
then
jacob
and
i
in
turn
gave
an
account
of
what
had
been
done
bringing
our
story
up
to
the
time
when
sergeant
corney
took
the
lead
in
the
attempt
to
gain
the
fort
and
the
old
man
could
not
well
refuse
to
describe
what
he
had
seen
that
night
regarding
the
disposition
of
the
enemy
forces
that
colonel
gansevoort
and
his
officers
were
deeply
interested
in
our
recital
may
be
understood
by
the
fact
that
day
had
fully
come
before
we
were
at
an
end
of
our
stories
and
yet
never
one
of
them
had
shown
the
slightest
impatience
or
a
desire
to
cut
us
short
i
know
of
no
greater
favor
which
could
have
been
done
the
garrison
save
that
of
bringing
in
additional
stores
and
larger
reinforcements
than
what
has
come
to
us
through
you
colonel
gansevoort
said
when
we
had
imparted
all
our
information
i
hope
you
will
not
regret
having
made
this
effort
to
aid
us
and
if
it
so
be
an
opportunity
ever
offers
i
will
see
to
it
that
so
far
as
is
within
my
power
the
minute
boys
of
the
mohawk
valley
shall
receive
substantial
credit
from
their
because
of
services
rendered
we
will
give
you
as
good
quarters
as
we
have
but
if
the
rations
seem
scanty
now
and
then
you
must
remember
that
we
are
not
in
position
to
get
all
we
may
require
in
the
way
of
eatables
will
you
answer
me
one
question
sir
an
not
deem
it
impertinent
sergeant
corney
asked
with
a
degree
of
humility
such
as
i
had
never
before
seen
him
exhibit
an
hundred
if
you
please
we
can
hardly
refuse
anything
to
those
who
have
given
us
so
much
encouragement
this
night
as
have
you
and
your
comrades
i
would
like
to
know
sir
simply
from
curiosity
an
not
because
it
would
make
any
difference
with
my
desire
to
go
or
stay
if
you
have
a
good
show
of
holdin
the
fort
against
so
strong
a
force
as
is
under
command
i
believe
we
have
the
colonel
replied
thoughtfully
at
all
events
i
promise
you
that
we
will
not
surrender
but
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
i
shall
sally
out
at
night
with
the
idea
of
cutting
my
way
through
the
enemy
lines
our
provisions
are
running
low
the
enemy
has
advanced
by
parallels
within
an
hundred
and
fifty
yards
and
the
store
of
ammunition
is
by
no
means
as
great
as
we
could
wish
our
only
hope
is
that
general
schuyler
may
be
able
to
succor
us
if
a
company
of
thirty
boys
can
move
through
thayendanega
camp
spy
upon
the
british
and
force
their
way
into
this
fort
unharmed
then
of
a
surety
can
i
do
half
as
much
colonel
willett
said
vehemently
i
will
undertake
to
make
my
way
to
general
schuyler
setting
out
when
another
night
shall
have
come
and
i
will
go
with
you
an
officer
whom
i
afterward
came
to
know
was
lieutenant
stockwell
cried
heartily
whereupon
the
sergeant
puffed
up
because
of
what
we
had
already
done
declared
that
jacob
he
and
i
would
act
as
messengers
it
is
enough
for
you
to
have
shown
us
that
the
task
can
be
accomplished
colonel
willett
said
with
a
smile
i
have
been
the
first
to
volunteer
for
such
service
and
claim
the
right
to
go
at
this
point
the
commandant
suggested
in
the
most
friendly
manner
that
perhaps
we
who
had
lately
arrived
might
be
in
need
of
food
and
i
fancied
he
made
this
suggestion
in
order
to
be
rid
of
us
while
he
and
his
officers
discussed
the
proposition
at
all
events
we
left
headquarters
and
were
conducted
by
lieutenant
stockwell
to
a
portion
of
the
barracks
which
was
set
aside
especially
for
the
minute
boys
to
the
end
that
we
might
all
be
together
rations
shall
be
served
you
at
once
the
lieutenant
said
as
he
turned
to
leave
us
and
although
he
kept
his
word
it
was
past
noon
before
we
had
an
opportunity
to
break
our
fast
because
it
seemed
as
if
nearly
every
man
in
the
garrison
was
eager
to
hold
personal
converse
with
us
in
order
to
learn
what
he
might
concerning
the
besieging
army
no
matter
however
much
we
as
a
company
might
succeed
in
doing
in
the
future
certain
it
is
we
could
not
be
petted
or
praised
more
than
we
were
during
that
first
day
in
the
fort
we
had
not
accomplished
anything
remarkable
so
far
as
i
could
see
aided
by
all
the
circumstances
and
particularly
by
the
fact
that
force
had
concluded
to
hold
a
powwow
with
the
indians
on
that
certain
night
we
had
come
across
the
plain
when
at
another
time
and
under
other
conditions
we
might
have
made
an
hundred
attempts
without
succeeding
it
was
as
sergeant
corney
would
put
it
the
fortune
of
war
or
the
accident
of
war
which
enabled
us
to
do
as
we
had
done
and
only
the
old
soldier
himself
could
take
personal
credit
for
our
being
there
if
the
garrison
was
on
short
allowance
we
never
would
have
suspected
it
during
the
first
four
and
twenty
hours
of
our
stay
for
every
man
inside
the
walls
who
had
anything
in
the
way
of
food
which
he
thought
might
tempt
our
appetites
offered
it
to
us
and
the
wonder
of
it
all
is
that
we
were
not
so
puffed
up
with
pride
as
to
behave
very
foolishly
late
in
the
afternoon
on
the
day
after
we
arrived
colonel
willett
came
to
our
quarters
and
sitting
down
among
us
regardless
of
his
rank
and
high
attainments
as
a
military
officer
talked
in
the
most
neighborly
fashion
with
us
concerning
the
surrounding
country
the
different
routes
we
had
pursued
when
coming
to
or
going
from
the
fort
and
particularly
concerning
what
we
might
have
heard
regarding
the
movements
of
the
enemy
between
fort
schuyler
and
oswego
of
course
to
this
last
question
we
could
give
no
satisfactory
reply
but
certain
it
is
that
he
gained
very
much
of
useful
information
which
would
serve
him
in
his
attempt
to
reach
general
schuyler
having
come
to
an
end
of
his
inquiries
he
told
us
that
it
had
been
determined
between
himself
and
the
commandant
that
on
the
next
stormy
night
he
and
lieutenant
stockwell
would
make
an
effort
to
leave
the
fort
on
their
way
to
stillwater
where
it
seems
he
believed
the
general
would
be
found
sergeant
corney
begged
hard
to
be
allowed
to
accompany
the
two
officers
but
the
colonel
said
laughingly
you
will
remain
where
you
are
sir
unless
it
is
in
your
mind
to
leave
here
because
of
the
danger
which
threatens
already
have
you
done
enough
in
the
way
of
scouting
i
hope
you
do
not
think
sir
that
i
would
run
away
because
of
like
that
no
my
man
i
am
quite
certain
you
never
would
but
you
are
not
to
gain
all
the
credit
in
this
siege
for
i
count
on
taking
some
of
it
myself
unless
peradventure
the
enemy
treat
me
worse
than
they
did
you
then
the
colonel
left
us
and
right
glad
was
i
that
he
had
not
accepted
the
sergeant
offer
for
i
might
in
some
way
have
been
dragged
into
the
venture
and
of
a
verity
i
had
had
enough
in
that
line
of
work
to
last
me
so
long
as
i
might
live
it
is
all
very
well
when
a
fellow
is
beyond
reach
of
danger
to
speculate
upon
what
might
be
done
to
gain
a
name
for
himself
but
quite
another
matter
to
take
his
life
in
his
hand
any
oftener
than
may
be
absolutely
necessary
on
the
following
morning
i
presented
myself
to
the
commandant
with
a
complaint
having
been
prompted
thereto
by
sergeant
corney
we
had
not
yet
been
assigned
to
any
duty
and
each
member
of
the
garrison
seemed
particularly
averse
to
allowing
us
to
even
help
ourselves
there
was
not
a
member
of
our
company
who
wished
to
remain
there
idle
and
i
visited
headquarters
to
ask
that
we
might
be
called
upon
for
the
regular
garrison
work
the
same
as
if
we
were
enlisted
men
colonel
gansevoort
very
kindly
assured
me
that
there
was
no
real
reason
why
we
should
do
duty
while
the
force
was
so
large
but
promised
if
we
insisted
upon
it
to
consider
us
when
making
a
detail
exactly
as
he
would
any
of
the
others
colonel
willett
had
not
long
to
wait
before
beginning
his
perilous
journey
by
noon
of
the
second
day
after
our
arrival
the
wind
veered
around
into
the
south
bringing
heavy
clouds
across
the
sky
and
even
the
poorest
weather
prophets
among
us
knew
that
a
summer
storm
was
close
at
hand
once
during
the
afternoon
the
colonel
passed
near
where
i
was
furbishing
up
my
rifle
and
halted
to
say
the
lieutenant
and
i
count
on
leaving
the
fort
shortly
before
midnight
if
you
and
your
friends
have
any
desire
to
see
us
set
out
go
down
to
the
new
works
at
about
that
time
by
the
new
works
he
meant
the
stockade
over
which
we
had
come
and
i
hastened
to
impart
the
information
to
sergeant
corney
and
jacob
knowing
full
well
that
they
would
be
as
interested
in
the
venture
as
was
i
the
volunteer
messengers
could
not
have
asked
for
a
better
night
when
the
day
had
come
to
an
end
the
storm
burst
with
no
inconsiderable
fury
and
it
was
safe
to
predict
that
it
would
not
clear
away
before
sunrise
had
i
been
going
on
the
venture
i
would
have
set
out
much
before
the
appointed
time
because
while
the
rain
came
down
so
furiously
there
was
little
chance
the
enemy
sentinels
could
see
what
might
be
going
on
at
the
southerly
end
of
the
fortification
and
it
seemed
as
if
my
opinion
was
shared
by
colonel
willett
for
he
and
the
lieutenant
were
ready
to
leave
at
about
ten
i
considered
it
very
friendly
in
him
to
send
us
word
as
to
his
change
of
plans
that
we
might
not
miss
seeing
them
set
forth
and
thus
it
was
we
beheld
the
two
brave
men
as
they
imperilled
their
lives
voluntarily
and
solely
in
the
hope
of
aiding
their
comrades
they
carried
no
weapons
save
spears
wore
no
clothing
except
what
was
absolutely
necessary
for
comfort
and
stripped
to
the
lightest
possible
marching
trim
they
went
out
into
the
blackness
of
the
night
like
true
heroes
with
a
smile
and
a
jest
upon
their
lips
there
were
not
above
twenty
of
us
who
witnessed
the
departure
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
no
more
fervent
prayers
for
their
safety
could
have
been
offered
up
if
the
whole
garrison
had
bent
the
knee
the
darkness
of
night
had
literally
swallowed
them
up
and
the
downpour
of
rain
drowned
every
noise
that
might
have
been
made
by
their
advance
it
was
a
brave
venture
more
particularly
because
without
chance
of
being
accused
in
the
slightest
degree
of
cowardice
they
might
have
yielded
their
places
to
others
during
half
an
hour
or
more
we
remained
exposed
to
the
storm
as
we
listened
with
painful
intentness
for
some
sound
which
should
tell
us
that
they
had
been
discovered
and
when
at
the
end
of
that
time
we
had
heard
nothing
it
was
believed
they
were
on
their
way
in
safety
later
in
the
day
we
learned
that
it
was
colonel
willett
intention
to
push
on
to
german
flats
and
there
procuring
horses
ride
at
full
speed
down
the
valley
to
general
schuyler
headquarters
having
once
got
clear
of
the
fort
and
its
vicinity
as
we
believed
to
be
the
fact
the
only
thing
which
might
prove
the
undoing
of
the
venture
was
that
the
general
had
gone
to
some
other
section
of
the
country
and
they
would
not
succeed
in
finding
him
until
leger
had
accomplished
his
purpose
well
we
settled
down
to
garrison
duty
taking
our
turn
with
the
squads
of
from
fifty
to
an
hundred
men
who
remained
constantly
on
the
alert
to
shoot
such
of
the
enemy
as
might
be
sufficiently
obliging
as
to
show
themselves
and
ready
to
give
warning
of
any
signs
of
an
attack
this
last
was
not
believed
probable
the
officers
of
the
garrison
argued
that
neither
the
indians
nor
the
tories
could
be
depended
upon
to
make
a
direct
assault
on
such
a
fortification
as
fort
schuyler
and
that
all
leger
efforts
would
be
directed
toward
advancing
his
parallels
until
he
was
sufficiently
near
to
mine
and
yet
how
true
is
the
old
maxim
that
it
is
always
the
unexpected
which
happens
on
the
third
morning
after
we
had
entered
the
fort
sergeant
corney
and
i
were
on
duty
as
sharpshooters
and
before
we
had
been
upon
the
walls
many
moments
i
called
his
attention
to
what
seemed
like
an
unusual
hurrying
to
and
fro
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
it
was
as
if
they
were
making
ready
for
some
important
movement
and
according
to
my
way
of
thinking
that
could
only
mean
an
assault
improbable
as
our
officers
believed
it
to
be
as
a
matter
of
course
we
gave
immediate
information
to
the
officer
of
the
day
of
what
we
fancied
had
been
discovered
and
within
half
an
hour
more
there
could
no
longer
be
any
doubt
but
that
leger
had
made
up
his
mind
to
see
what
might
be
accomplished
by
a
direct
attack
i
was
disposed
to
make
light
of
the
matter
not
believing
it
possible
the
enemy
could
effect
anything
of
importance
but
lost
somewhat
of
my
confidence
on
observing
the
grave
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
officers
what
is
it
i
asked
of
sergeant
corney
do
they
fancy
for
a
moment
that
even
though
the
indians
should
be
willing
to
take
part
in
the
assault
the
fort
could
be
carried
no
lad
i
reckon
they
not
sich
fools
as
that
but
it
has
come
to
my
ears
that
ammunition
for
the
cannon
is
runnin
mighty
low
an
to
repel
an
attack
even
though
there
be
no
danger
come
from
it
will
be
a
serious
matter
even
then
i
failed
to
understand
what
the
old
soldier
meant
and
asked
him
to
explain
more
fully
which
he
did
then
i
came
to
realize
that
to
expend
our
ammunition
for
the
big
guns
at
that
time
might
result
disastrously
for
us
later
when
the
parallels
having
been
brought
nearer
an
assault
would
be
vastly
more
menacing
however
leger
had
the
right
to
do
whatsoever
he
might
and
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
wiser
course
had
he
known
exactly
the
amount
of
powder
in
our
magazine
the
gunners
were
sent
to
their
stations
the
remainder
of
the
force
disposed
here
or
there
as
they
might
be
the
most
useful
we
minute
boys
being
stationed
near
the
which
as
sergeant
corney
said
was
a
great
compliment
because
at
about
that
place
might
the
hottest
work
be
expected
it
was
not
pleasant
this
making
ready
for
a
battle
when
we
went
into
action
with
general
herkimer
it
was
done
quickly
we
suspected
something
of
the
kind
might
happen
but
were
not
certain
of
it
now
there
could
be
no
question
but
that
in
a
short
time
at
the
most
we
would
be
striving
to
kill
human
beings
and
unable
except
at
the
cost
of
being
branded
as
cowards
to
do
anything
toward
saving
our
own
lives
chapter
xiii
the
assault
if
i
have
not
spoken
of
peter
sitz
since
he
was
rescued
by
the
minute
boys
it
is
because
he
did
not
remain
in
the
barracks
with
us
from
cherry
valley
but
messed
with
some
of
his
acquaintances
from
german
flats
therefore
we
saw
very
little
of
him
until
the
garrison
was
mustered
to
repel
the
threatened
attack
then
i
noted
that
colonel
gansevoort
had
entrusted
to
him
the
charge
of
a
certain
portion
of
the
wall
nearly
opposite
where
the
minute
boys
were
stationed
and
because
he
had
been
placed
in
command
even
though
it
was
of
course
only
temporary
i
judged
and
truly
that
jacob
father
was
accounted
an
able
assistant
in
such
work
as
we
most
likely
had
before
us
sergeant
corney
remained
with
the
minute
boys
as
was
his
duty
i
believe
of
a
verity
my
company
would
have
grumbled
almost
as
loudly
as
had
general
herkimer
men
on
the
morning
before
the
fight
at
oriskany
had
the
old
soldier
taken
station
elsewhere
and
yet
it
would
have
been
but
natural
for
him
to
go
into
the
fight
side
by
side
with
those
of
the
garrison
who
were
most
experienced
in
warfare
as
i
have
said
we
were
given
a
post
which
had
in
it
no
inconsiderable
honor
since
it
was
at
that
point
where
the
most
fighting
might
be
expected
and
from
where
we
stood
it
was
possible
to
have
a
fairly
good
view
of
the
plain
immediately
surrounding
the
fort
within
twenty
minutes
after
the
alarm
was
first
given
we
could
see
the
british
and
tory
soldiers
forming
in
line
while
to
the
southward
below
the
bend
in
the
river
the
indians
were
crossing
hurriedly
which
last
fact
caused
me
to
say
to
the
sergeant
i
am
of
the
mind
that
the
savages
count
on
attacking
the
stockaded
portion
of
the
fortification
and
the
old
man
replied
ay
lad
an
one
might
have
guessed
that
without
stopping
to
see
from
which
direction
they
were
comin
thayendanega
may
prate
as
much
as
he
pleases
about
the
bravery
of
his
warriors
but
he
can
not
find
a
guard
among
the
whole
crowd
that
would
dare
march
up
to
a
direct
assault
upon
earthworks
what
portion
of
the
force
is
on
duty
in
the
stockade
jacob
asked
but
none
of
our
company
could
answer
him
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
colonel
gansevoort
had
stationed
there
those
of
his
men
who
were
most
experienced
in
savage
warfare
and
we
whose
duty
it
was
to
hold
the
walls
in
the
vicinity
of
the
had
no
need
to
trouble
our
heads
concerning
them
the
one
thing
which
puzzled
me
was
as
to
why
leger
was
making
this
attack
since
he
had
begun
to
approach
the
fort
by
parallels
i
was
eager
to
have
some
expert
opinion
as
to
whether
the
british
were
apparently
abandoning
the
slow
method
of
reducing
the
fortification
or
if
having
learned
perchance
that
we
were
running
short
of
ammunition
for
the
big
guns
they
were
making
an
attack
in
order
to
provoke
us
to
waste
powder
which
would
be
more
sadly
needed
at
some
later
day
therefore
it
was
that
i
asked
sergeant
corney
what
his
belief
was
regarding
the
matter
it
looks
to
me
much
as
if
colonel
willett
an
lieutenant
stockwell
had
been
captured
how
do
you
figure
that
out
because
an
assault
is
evidently
about
to
be
made
if
they
are
not
prisoners
the
enemy
has
learned
that
they
left
the
fort
i
was
still
in
darkness
as
to
why
he
arrived
at
such
conclusion
but
found
the
reason
exceedingly
plain
when
he
said
if
leger
knows
that
a
man
of
colonel
willett
rank
was
eager
to
take
the
chances
of
leaving
the
fortification
to
summon
assistance
he
must
believe
the
garrison
is
in
sore
straits
an
therefore
it
is
that
i
believe
the
mistake
was
made
in
allowin
him
to
go
out
when
there
were
plenty
of
others
here
willin
to
take
the
chances
it
grieved
me
sorely
to
think
that
the
brave
officer
might
be
at
that
moment
in
the
hands
of
the
savages
or
what
amounted
to
much
the
same
thing
in
the
custody
of
the
britishers
for
it
was
charged
openly
that
in
order
to
keep
the
indian
allies
in
good
temper
prisoners
taken
by
his
majesty
troops
were
often
delivered
over
to
the
wolves
for
torture
however
there
was
but
little
time
left
me
in
which
to
speculate
upon
this
painful
matter
for
even
as
sergeant
corney
and
i
spoke
together
the
british
troops
supported
by
the
johnson
greens
came
out
into
view
from
amid
the
encampment
marching
directly
toward
the
fort
there
is
more
in
this
than
an
ordinary
assault
i
heard
the
sergeant
mutter
as
he
looked
to
the
priming
of
his
musket
leger
would
not
expose
his
men
to
the
slaughter
which
must
follow
without
good
and
sufficient
cause
i
not
overly
given
to
praising
the
britishers
but
we
must
admit
that
he
who
in
command
here
is
a
thoroughly
good
soldier
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
would
have
been
conscious
of
a
certain
chill
along
my
spine
and
felt
my
knees
trembling
beneath
me
at
the
certainty
of
soon
being
engaged
in
a
life
or
death
struggle
but
after
my
experience
as
a
prisoner
there
was
but
one
thought
in
my
heart
and
that
of
repaying
the
enemy
for
some
of
the
sufferings
i
had
undergone
the
desire
for
revenge
was
greater
than
the
fear
of
death
before
many
moments
passed
sergeant
corney
hit
upon
what
i
firmly
believed
was
the
true
answer
to
my
question
of
why
an
assault
was
to
be
made
at
this
time
the
britishers
and
tories
advanced
in
good
order
until
facing
the
northerly
and
westerly
sides
of
the
fort
within
range
and
from
that
distance
poured
their
bullets
into
us
without
doing
much
execution
but
calling
for
strict
attention
on
our
part
lest
a
charge
be
made
for
the
ditch
was
not
so
wide
or
deep
but
that
a
body
of
trained
soldiers
could
have
overcome
the
obstacle
only
twice
were
the
guns
which
could
be
trained
in
that
direction
discharged
and
then
we
inflicted
no
slight
injury
upon
the
foe
but
colonel
gansevoort
soon
showed
that
he
was
far
too
prudent
a
commander
to
shoot
away
all
his
powder
at
one
time
even
though
it
was
possible
to
punish
the
enemy
severely
it
looked
much
as
if
the
king
forces
were
bent
on
continuing
the
battle
with
small
arms
at
short
range
for
they
discharged
their
pieces
as
rapidly
as
it
was
possible
to
reload
them
making
a
great
din
even
though
the
execution
was
slight
then
it
was
that
sergeant
corney
hit
upon
the
meaning
of
this
odd
move
without
a
word
he
leaped
down
from
the
wall
where
he
had
been
stationed
running
swiftly
toward
the
unfinished
portion
of
the
fortification
and
was
gone
no
more
than
three
or
four
minutes
when
he
returned
with
more
show
of
excitement
than
i
had
ever
known
him
to
exhibit
yonder
britishers
and
renegades
are
but
holding
our
attention
in
order
to
give
thayendanega
wolves
a
chance
to
scale
the
stockade
he
said
hurriedly
the
force
there
is
all
too
small
i
will
take
half
of
the
company
at
risk
of
disobeying
orders
to
that
point
while
you
go
with
all
speed
and
tell
the
commandant
what
i
have
learned
i
understood
the
situation
without
further
explanation
and
realizing
the
necessity
for
haste
went
as
rapidly
as
my
legs
would
carry
me
to
the
northeast
bastion
where
i
had
last
seen
colonel
gansevoort
fortunately
for
my
purpose
he
was
still
there
giving
directions
as
to
the
firing
of
the
guns
and
in
a
twinkling
i
had
acquainted
him
with
the
situation
as
described
by
sergeant
corney
at
the
same
time
explaining
that
half
the
minute
boys
had
been
withdrawn
from
near
the
the
sergeant
has
done
well
the
commandant
replied
ten
of
your
number
should
be
more
than
sufficient
there
if
matters
are
as
they
seem
tell
sergeant
braun
i
will
join
him
as
soon
as
possible
then
i
ran
with
all
speed
to
my
company
and
explaining
to
john
sammons
my
purpose
took
with
me
half
the
number
remaining
under
his
command
with
this
small
force
i
set
off
at
full
speed
and
we
arrived
none
too
soon
at
the
place
where
the
most
desperate
fighting
was
going
on
at
the
beginning
of
the
action
no
more
than
forty
men
had
been
stationed
in
the
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
entire
stockaded
portion
was
surrounded
by
a
dancing
horde
of
howling
maddened
indians
who
bringing
with
them
or
stout
branches
were
throwing
up
such
a
heap
of
odds
and
ends
as
admitted
of
their
gaining
the
top
of
the
logs
despite
the
fire
which
our
people
were
pouring
upon
them
it
must
be
set
down
here
that
there
were
no
cannon
in
this
unfinished
portion
of
the
fortification
the
rebellion
against
the
king
had
broken
out
before
this
very
necessary
adjunct
to
the
strength
of
the
fort
could
be
completed
and
consequently
it
was
the
weakest
portion
of
our
defence
when
i
arrived
with
my
comrades
at
this
point
our
people
were
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
the
savages
three
score
or
more
having
succeeded
in
effecting
an
entrance
and
it
needed
no
experienced
eye
to
say
that
unless
the
onrush
could
be
speedily
checked
the
capture
of
the
fort
might
be
effected
at
a
time
when
we
had
believed
leger
was
simply
making
a
feint
exactly
what
happened
during
the
next
i
am
unable
to
state
of
my
own
knowledge
for
i
had
no
sooner
entered
the
than
it
became
necessary
to
put
forth
every
effort
in
the
saving
of
my
own
life
a
gigantic
savage
discharged
his
musket
with
seemingly
true
aim
directly
at
my
head
but
strangely
enough
missed
the
target
and
then
he
came
at
me
hatchet
in
hand
with
such
fury
that
for
an
instant
it
seemed
as
if
i
was
at
his
mercy
so
excited
was
i
that
my
bullet
which
should
have
found
lodgment
in
his
heart
went
as
wild
as
had
his
and
then
was
i
forced
to
use
a
clubbed
musket
for
defence
had
any
one
asked
me
on
that
morning
if
i
believed
it
possible
to
withstand
the
attack
of
an
indian
the
two
of
us
using
the
weapons
i
have
just
described
my
answer
would
have
been
a
decided
no
and
yet
now
i
held
him
in
good
play
although
realizing
that
each
moment
i
was
growing
weaker
and
he
gaining
the
advantage
already
were
my
eyes
becoming
suffused
with
blood
my
brain
was
in
a
whirl
as
i
leaped
here
or
there
parrying
with
the
butt
of
the
musket
the
blows
of
his
hatchet
and
all
the
time
he
continued
to
press
me
nearer
and
nearer
toward
the
wall
where
my
resistance
would
have
been
overcome
within
a
very
short
time
i
wondered
why
it
was
that
colonel
gansevoort
delayed
in
the
coming
and
could
see
without
looking
in
any
direction
save
at
my
foe
that
the
number
of
savages
inside
the
stockade
was
increasing
each
moment
illustration
the
painted
villain
sank
down
upon
the
ground
only
a
brief
delay
now
on
the
part
of
the
commandant
and
they
would
gain
so
great
an
advantage
that
such
portion
of
the
garrison
as
could
be
withdrawn
from
the
walls
where
the
britishers
were
making
the
pretended
attack
would
not
be
able
to
dislodge
them
then
suddenly
at
the
very
moment
when
it
seemed
impossible
i
could
struggle
any
longer
the
painted
villain
sank
down
upon
the
ground
as
if
having
received
his
and
i
dimly
heard
sergeant
corney
cry
cheerily
that
was
a
narrow
squeak
lad
an
we
hope
there
be
many
more
of
before
the
last
one
comes
keep
yourself
well
in
hand
for
of
a
verity
our
work
is
cut
out
for
us
here
now
it
was
i
knew
that
a
shot
from
the
old
soldier
musket
had
put
an
end
to
the
combat
in
which
i
was
most
deeply
interested
and
i
strained
every
nerve
to
gather
myself
together
as
he
had
commanded
by
this
time
i
dare
venture
to
say
no
less
than
two
hundred
of
the
howling
demons
had
scaled
the
stockade
and
we
who
were
defending
this
weakest
portion
of
the
fortification
were
pressed
back
and
back
until
we
stood
massed
against
that
opening
which
gave
entrance
to
the
main
fortification
we
were
in
good
position
for
the
enemy
to
mow
us
down
with
bullets
and
in
such
close
formation
that
only
those
in
the
outermost
ranks
could
use
their
weapons
to
advantage
it
is
all
over
i
said
to
myself
realizing
that
within
a
very
few
moments
we
must
be
killed
or
disabled
under
such
a
fire
as
scoundrels
were
pouring
upon
us
then
from
our
rear
i
heard
ringing
cheers
the
trampling
of
many
feet
and
realized
that
assistance
had
come
at
the
most
critical
moment
sixty
seconds
later
we
had
all
been
slain
like
sheep
in
the
shambles
give
way
give
way
lads
in
front
i
heard
colonel
gansevoort
shout
and
hardly
understanding
the
words
instinctively
we
surged
either
side
of
the
passage
having
hardly
done
so
before
a
shower
of
came
hurtling
between
our
ranks
dealing
death
to
scores
of
the
wretches
stand
to
your
muskets
you
minute
boys
sergeant
corney
shouted
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
stiffened
my
courage
wonderfully
now
is
the
time
to
pay
back
some
of
our
old
scores
and
every
bullet
should
cut
short
a
life
from
among
those
who
would
harry
us
of
the
valley
he
had
hardly
more
than
ceased
speaking
when
a
great
uproar
could
be
heard
from
the
distance
and
without
turning
my
head
i
understood
that
the
british
regulars
and
the
johnson
greens
were
pressing
the
attack
on
the
west
and
the
front
in
order
to
hold
our
men
at
the
walls
that
we
might
not
be
able
to
regain
possession
of
the
stockade
now
the
fight
was
on
in
good
earnest
and
a
bloodier
one
or
a
more
desperate
struggle
i
hope
never
to
see
again
after
the
single
cannon
which
colonel
gansevoort
had
caused
to
be
brought
in
was
discharged
the
reinforcements
betook
themselves
to
their
muskets
for
our
frontiersmen
were
more
accustomed
to
the
use
of
small
arms
than
big
guns
and
the
tide
surged
this
way
and
that
with
the
fate
of
the
fort
trembling
more
than
once
in
the
balance
until
i
had
before
my
eyes
only
great
billows
of
feathered
forms
which
rose
and
fell
advanced
and
were
forced
back
until
i
was
bewildered
before
this
portion
of
the
fighting
had
come
to
an
end
fully
half
the
garrison
was
engaged
in
repelling
the
attack
of
thayendanega
forces
and
during
such
time
the
white
portion
of
the
enemy
army
might
have
made
a
successful
assault
upon
the
walls
i
verily
believe
but
for
the
cowardice
displayed
by
the
tories
how
long
we
struggled
there
hand
to
hand
stumbling
now
over
the
lifeless
forms
of
our
comrades
and
again
finding
our
way
checked
by
the
dead
bodies
of
the
savages
i
can
not
say
but
certain
it
is
that
we
finally
drove
the
last
of
the
hated
foe
over
the
stockade
and
gave
boasting
braves
such
a
lesson
as
they
would
not
need
to
have
repeated
for
many
days
i
was
not
less
wearied
with
the
carnage
than
those
around
me
even
sergeant
corney
to
whom
such
scenes
were
not
strange
leaned
against
a
portion
of
the
earthworks
as
if
for
support
while
he
dashed
the
perspiration
from
his
eyes
and
then
we
knew
by
the
sounds
that
the
battle
was
being
waged
severely
over
against
the
then
it
was
i
called
for
the
minute
boys
to
follow
me
as
i
ran
at
the
best
pace
possible
in
that
direction
for
there
was
our
post
of
duty
now
colonel
gansevoort
no
longer
husbanded
his
store
of
ammunition
intended
for
the
cannon
and
every
piece
in
the
northern
and
eastern
bastions
was
being
worked
with
the
utmost
rapidity
sending
among
the
tories
such
a
shower
of
iron
as
their
cowardly
hearts
could
not
hold
out
against
and
when
they
turned
with
cries
of
fear
to
flee
the
british
regulars
understanding
that
they
were
too
few
in
number
to
effect
anything
against
us
joined
in
the
retreat
the
assault
had
come
to
an
end
and
we
of
the
garrison
were
triumphant
but
at
such
an
expense
of
life
that
we
could
not
well
afford
many
more
such
victories
during
that
night
we
buried
our
dead
four
and
twenty
men
committing
them
to
the
dust
under
cover
of
darkness
lest
the
enemy
see
how
much
injury
he
had
inflicted
and
thank
god
never
a
member
of
my
company
who
could
not
answer
to
the
there
were
so
seriously
wounded
that
it
was
necessary
a
certain
force
be
told
off
from
among
the
garrison
to
play
the
part
of
nurses
and
when
to
the
number
of
disabled
is
added
those
who
were
to
care
for
them
it
can
be
seen
that
leger
struck
us
a
severe
blow
even
though
he
did
not
succeed
in
his
purpose
we
buried
our
comrades
in
the
just
under
the
stockade
they
had
defended
so
gallantly
and
threw
over
the
fence
of
logs
of
thayendanega
wolves
who
would
take
no
further
part
in
murder
and
rapine
it
is
positive
that
there
must
have
been
many
wounded
among
the
indians
some
so
severely
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
them
to
accompany
their
fellows
in
the
retreat
but
yet
we
found
none
that
had
any
life
in
them
when
we
searched
among
the
ghastly
evidences
of
the
fight
for
our
own
people
peter
sitz
declared
that
he
had
seen
one
of
the
wounded
savages
deliberately
kill
himself
with
a
knife
when
it
was
seen
that
the
assault
had
failed
and
i
doubt
not
but
that
several
did
the
same
rather
than
fall
into
our
hands
then
also
it
is
possible
in
the
heat
of
battle
and
remembering
what
these
human
wolves
had
done
to
the
women
and
children
of
the
settlements
which
had
been
attacked
some
of
our
men
had
sent
more
than
one
of
the
helpless
wretches
to
the
happy
hunting
grounds
i
count
myself
as
as
any
other
and
yet
it
would
not
have
troubled
my
conscience
had
i
put
a
few
wounded
villains
out
of
the
world
rather
than
let
them
live
to
commit
yet
more
murders
on
the
morning
after
the
assault
a
white
flag
was
raised
over
the
fort
and
when
leger
sent
in
hot
haste
a
messenger
to
learn
what
we
wanted
thinking
most
like
we
had
made
up
our
minds
to
surrender
he
was
informed
that
colonel
gansevoort
was
willing
to
grant
an
hour
truce
that
the
british
and
indian
dead
might
be
buried
this
the
enemy
accepted
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
never
one
of
thayendanega
beauties
came
forward
to
carry
off
the
slain
of
his
tribe
i
had
always
heard
it
said
that
the
redskins
would
brave
any
danger
rather
than
allow
a
dead
indian
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
an
enemy
but
certain
it
is
that
on
this
day
the
rascally
tories
dragged
away
the
bodies
with
not
even
a
squaw
to
help
them
within
the
time
set
we
were
rid
of
the
ghastly
evidence
of
the
battle
which
might
have
proven
a
menace
to
the
health
of
the
garrison
had
the
corpses
been
allowed
to
remain
unburied
while
the
weather
was
so
warm
and
during
all
the
coming
night
we
could
hear
distinctly
cries
of
lamentation
from
the
indian
camp
it
was
as
if
every
brave
squaw
and
papoose
howled
his
or
her
loudest
in
token
of
sorrow
and
three
of
us
within
the
fort
had
a
very
good
idea
of
what
would
have
been
our
fate
had
we
not
been
rescued
before
the
assault
this
would
have
been
our
last
night
on
earth
had
the
minute
boys
not
come
to
the
rescue
peter
sitz
said
to
me
as
we
stood
near
the
for
an
instant
listening
to
the
wild
cries
and
strong
man
though
he
was
i
took
note
of
the
fact
that
his
face
shone
pale
in
the
faint
light
it
did
not
need
that
i
should
strain
my
imagination
very
much
to
paint
a
mental
picture
of
our
condition
at
that
time
if
we
had
remained
in
the
power
of
the
savages
of
a
verity
we
would
have
tested
their
keenest
torture
before
death
came
to
our
relief
it
would
seem
as
if
that
company
of
ours
had
been
formed
to
some
purpose
an
not
all
of
them
were
children
i
said
minded
that
he
who
had
laughed
most
heartily
at
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
our
pretensions
should
give
credit
where
it
was
due
if
i
live
to
see
home
again
there
is
never
a
man
in
cherry
valley
who
shall
not
hear
from
me
what
i
owe
to
you
lads
do
forget
that
i
had
no
part
in
the
rescue
master
sitz
for
surely
i
was
trussed
up
as
stoutly
as
either
you
or
sergeant
corney
yet
but
for
your
persistence
we
would
never
have
thought
of
enlisting
the
boys
to
aid
in
our
defence
therefore
must
you
take
your
portion
of
the
praise
an
more
especially
since
it
is
said
by
sergeant
corney
himself
that
you
have
proven
yourself
a
man
at
every
time
when
danger
threatened
sergeant
corney
has
no
idea
how
my
knees
shook
beneath
me
when
as
he
believed
i
was
i
replied
with
a
careless
laugh
that
served
to
cloak
the
feeling
of
pride
which
rose
in
my
bosom
when
he
gave
good
words
to
the
minute
boys
while
weeping
over
our
dead
and
rejoicing
because
of
having
beaten
back
the
enemy
when
it
seemed
as
if
the
assault
was
about
to
be
successful
fear
regarding
the
safety
of
colonel
willett
and
lieutenant
stockwell
lay
heavily
upon
our
hearts
it
was
the
belief
of
nearly
all
the
garrison
that
the
two
officers
had
been
captured
and
if
such
had
been
the
case
there
could
be
no
question
but
that
they
suffered
a
terrible
death
at
the
stake
while
the
savages
were
mourning
over
their
loss
those
among
us
who
felt
convinced
that
the
messengers
had
succeeded
in
their
attempt
and
colonel
gansevoort
was
one
of
the
hopeful
ones
insisted
that
if
the
indians
had
tortured
any
prisoners
to
death
we
must
have
heard
yells
and
shouts
of
triumph
yet
the
night
wind
had
brought
to
our
ears
nothing
more
than
the
cries
of
sorrow
viewing
the
situation
in
the
brightest
light
possible
many
days
must
of
a
necessity
elapse
before
we
could
hope
for
any
good
results
from
their
brave
venture
and
if
in
the
meantime
the
enemy
pressed
us
sharply
we
would
be
in
hard
straits
more
particularly
since
so
much
of
our
ammunition
had
been
expended
in
defending
the
fort
against
that
first
assault
when
a
large
number
of
men
are
confined
in
a
limited
space
and
exposed
to
danger
it
needs
but
the
lightest
word
to
make
cowards
of
the
more
as
we
soon
had
good
proof
on
the
day
following
the
truce
after
the
enemy
had
buried
their
dead
work
on
the
parallels
was
continued
and
it
gave
me
no
little
satisfaction
to
see
that
the
tories
were
forced
to
perform
the
greater
portion
of
the
labor
as
i
have
already
said
these
trenches
extended
within
an
hundred
and
fifty
yards
of
the
fort
by
this
time
and
we
knew
only
too
well
that
it
was
not
within
our
power
to
prevent
their
being
advanced
as
near
as
the
enemy
saw
fit
to
carry
them
after
a
certain
time
mining
would
probably
be
begun
and
then
if
our
supply
of
ammunition
had
not
been
replenished
the
end
must
be
near
at
hand
when
leger
would
have
opportunity
to
carry
into
execution
his
threat
of
allowing
thayendanega
murderers
to
work
their
cruel
will
all
this
was
talked
over
and
commented
upon
by
our
people
as
the
days
wore
on
and
the
more
timid
seemed
to
find
delight
in
picturing
what
would
take
place
if
the
fort
was
captured
why
must
they
keep
harpin
on
that
possibility
all
the
time
i
asked
angrily
of
sergeant
corney
when
i
had
turned
away
in
disgust
from
a
group
of
men
who
were
painting
horrible
and
the
old
soldier
had
followed
me
to
the
beyond
sound
of
such
words
it
is
all
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
lad
the
old
man
said
grimly
look
about
an
you
see
that
them
as
are
makin
the
howl
over
what
the
injuns
may
do
are
the
among
us
it
all
done
for
one
purpose
what
can
that
be
i
asked
in
surprise
how
do
they
suppose
any
good
can
come
of
conjuring
up
everything
horrible
they
of
the
same
kidney
that
drove
general
herkimer
into
the
ambush
an
are
tryin
to
force
the
colonel
to
surrender
that
ca
be
possible
i
cried
sharply
there
never
one
among
them
who
does
not
know
full
well
what
the
result
will
be
if
colonel
gansevoort
surrenders
the
fort
leger
promises
would
be
as
the
idle
wind
when
thayendanega
followers
wanted
victims
for
the
stake
true
for
you
lad
an
yet
these
cowards
are
ready
to
howl
for
capitulation
rather
than
fight
as
men
should
in
the
presence
of
such
an
enemy
to
the
last
ditch
the
sergeant
replied
bitterly
i
could
not
believe
that
among
the
entire
garrison
might
be
found
one
soldier
who
would
willingly
consent
to
a
surrender
and
said
as
much
to
the
old
man
who
replied
grimly
i
have
been
around
here
for
the
past
four
an
twenty
hours
with
my
eyes
shut
an
my
ears
filled
with
moss
take
a
turn
about
the
works
listenin
to
all
that
is
said
an
you
find
i
not
wrong
in
my
figgerin
the
colonel
knows
as
well
as
do
i
what
in
the
wind
an
agree
never
to
eat
agin
if
he
ai
makin
ready
for
trouble
inside
the
fort
as
well
as
outside
i
remained
silent
a
full
minute
horrified
by
the
bare
possibility
and
then
asked
in
a
voice
which
trembled
despite
all
my
efforts
to
render
it
steady
think
you
they
can
force
him
against
his
will
as
the
militia
did
general
herkimer
it
is
my
belief
that
he
shoot
down
a
round
dozen
before
consentin
to
give
us
all
over
to
death
but
there
no
knowin
what
a
man
may
be
forced
into
when
pressure
enough
has
been
brought
to
bear
upon
him
at
this
moment
jacob
came
up
looking
like
his
old
self
now
that
his
father
was
safe
at
least
for
the
time
being
and
to
him
i
put
the
matter
much
as
i
had
had
it
from
the
sergeant
within
the
hour
i
have
heard
the
same
word
from
my
father
he
believes
there
are
a
full
hundred
of
the
garrison
who
when
they
have
worked
themselves
up
to
just
such
a
pitch
will
howl
for
surrender
even
then
i
refused
to
believe
in
what
was
as
yet
no
more
than
a
suspicion
and
sergeant
corney
said
impatiently
it
wo
cost
you
much
time
to
find
out
for
yourself
lad
take
a
couple
of
turns
around
an
i
guarantee
you
agree
that
peter
sitz
an
i
are
not
tryin
to
make
mountains
out
of
i
go
with
you
jacob
said
promptly
and
straightway
we
set
out
keeping
our
ears
open
whenever
we
came
within
speaking
distance
of
a
group
of
men
who
appeared
to
be
talking
earnestly
upon
some
particular
subject
it
was
not
necessary
that
we
should
go
twice
around
the
inside
of
the
fortification
for
before
we
completed
the
first
circuit
i
had
heard
enough
to
convince
me
that
sergeant
corney
instead
of
exaggerating
the
matter
had
not
made
his
statements
strong
enough
by
as
it
seemed
to
me
a
full
third
of
the
garrison
were
arguing
in
favor
of
surrender
giving
as
their
reasons
the
scanty
supply
of
powder
for
the
cannon
and
the
probability
that
leger
army
would
constantly
increase
as
the
tories
from
the
mohawk
valley
got
wind
of
what
was
going
on
i
was
sick
at
heart
and
literally
faint
with
fear
when
this
knowledge
was
forced
in
upon
me
for
i
knew
only
too
well
how
idle
would
be
all
the
promises
of
leger
if
the
savages
were
inclined
to
massacre
the
prisoners
that
were
surrendered
on
promises
of
fair
treatment
chapter
xiv
mutiny
i
had
thought
that
we
would
never
again
be
called
upon
to
witness
such
a
scene
as
that
in
general
herkimer
encampment
on
the
morning
when
those
who
later
were
the
first
to
show
the
white
feather
literally
drove
him
into
a
place
where
he
as
a
soldier
knew
it
was
not
safe
to
venture
until
all
the
arrangements
for
a
sortie
from
the
fort
were
completed
now
however
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
to
be
treated
to
a
second
dose
of
mutiny
and
this
one
more
serious
than
the
first
for
in
case
these
fools
in
the
fort
succeeded
in
badgering
colonel
gansevoort
as
the
others
had
the
general
then
would
nearly
a
thousand
men
be
given
over
to
the
savage
foe
whom
we
knew
full
well
would
show
no
mercy
to
me
the
strange
part
of
it
all
was
that
these
very
simpletons
who
were
howling
so
loudly
for
surrender
would
be
among
those
counted
as
prisoners
and
i
failed
utterly
to
understand
how
they
could
figure
themselves
as
being
better
off
in
the
power
of
thayendanega
wolves
than
in
the
fort
where
they
had
a
chance
of
fighting
to
the
death
even
to
this
day
it
seems
so
strange
that
i
would
not
dare
set
it
down
as
a
fact
unless
those
gentlemen
who
write
history
had
spoken
of
it
so
plainly
you
can
make
up
your
mind
that
those
fellows
who
are
lettin
out
the
most
noise
are
the
ones
who
got
a
cowardly
streak
in
somewhere
sergeant
corney
said
when
jacob
and
i
having
satisfied
ourselves
that
mutiny
was
rife
in
the
fort
went
to
him
for
the
purpose
of
talking
the
matter
over
the
greater
the
cowards
the
less
inclined
they
should
be
to
surrender
as
it
seems
to
me
i
replied
in
perplexity
ay
lad
that
the
way
it
looks
to
a
decent
man
but
sich
fellows
as
these
here
who
are
makin
a
row
are
the
ones
who
always
lookin
ahead
thinkin
matters
may
be
bettered
an
regardin
not
the
possibility
of
their
growin
worse
here
they
are
like
to
come
on
short
allowance
obleeged
to
take
their
turn
at
bein
shot
at
now
an
then
consequently
not
havin
the
heart
to
endure
even
the
lightest
sufferin
they
say
we
ca
be
any
worse
off
an
ought
to
surrender
but
they
know
the
nature
of
thayendanega
wolves
as
well
as
do
you
or
i
yes
they
did
know
yesterday
but
now
because
their
stomachs
are
not
quite
full
they
ready
to
admit
that
every
redskin
is
an
imitation
angel
think
you
they
can
badger
the
colonel
jacob
asked
thoughtfully
thus
repeating
my
question
in
different
words
i
will
say
to
you
as
i
did
to
noel
that
they
like
to
get
the
rough
end
of
it
before
drivin
him
into
a
mistake
we
who
are
not
inclined
to
be
mutinous
can
help
him
out
a
good
bit
in
this
matter
how
i
asked
in
perplexity
by
standin
out
stiffly
against
their
fool
talk
though
there
ai
much
chance
you
can
convince
with
words
but
if
one
or
half
a
dozen
for
that
matter
gives
me
an
openin
i
see
if
the
weight
of
my
fist
beat
some
sense
into
them
it
is
not
agreeable
to
set
down
the
details
of
such
a
disgraceful
scene
as
we
witnessed
during
the
next
four
and
twenty
hours
and
more
than
painful
to
describe
how
the
mutiny
was
finally
checked
it
must
be
done
however
if
i
would
write
fairly
the
part
which
we
minute
boys
of
the
mohawk
valley
took
in
the
troubles
and
triumphs
fort
schuyler
but
i
will
give
the
story
in
as
few
words
as
possible
it
so
chanced
that
during
this
day
the
rations
dealt
out
to
us
were
smaller
than
before
and
this
gave
the
fool
croakers
an
opportunity
of
airing
their
grievances
in
fine
style
those
who
should
have
been
steadily
attentive
to
their
duties
with
never
a
thought
in
their
minds
of
anything
save
besting
the
motley
crew
that
besieged
us
began
to
talk
openly
of
starvation
as
if
there
was
no
question
whatsoever
but
that
we
had
come
nearly
to
the
end
of
our
provisions
and
thus
as
i
believe
they
brought
over
to
their
way
of
thinking
many
who
never
would
have
listened
to
such
wild
talk
but
for
the
fact
that
it
seemed
probable
the
hour
of
surrender
must
be
near
at
hand
i
saw
to
it
that
none
of
the
minute
boys
sided
with
these
malcontents
while
sergeant
corney
and
peter
sitz
moved
here
and
there
throughout
the
day
trying
to
persuade
the
men
to
do
only
that
which
was
for
their
own
good
but
without
success
the
longer
such
talk
ran
through
the
garrison
the
stronger
it
became
until
shortly
before
sunset
the
mutiny
was
so
well
advanced
that
the
commandant
could
do
no
less
than
take
serious
notice
of
it
and
it
pleased
me
that
he
did
not
delay
save
for
the
sentinels
on
the
walls
the
entire
garrison
was
called
out
as
for
parade
and
having
been
clumsily
formed
in
a
hollow
square
colonel
gansevoort
surrounded
by
his
staff
of
officers
undertook
to
still
the
rising
tempest
he
began
by
saying
that
it
was
the
opinion
of
himself
and
his
staff
that
the
men
ought
to
know
exactly
the
condition
of
affairs
lest
they
be
led
astray
by
idle
fears
and
to
that
end
he
called
upon
the
quartermaster
for
a
detailed
statement
of
the
amount
of
eatables
then
on
hand
when
this
had
been
given
and
it
required
some
time
to
read
the
entire
list
he
announced
the
number
of
men
women
and
children
which
were
inside
the
walls
of
the
fort
figuring
out
that
by
slightly
decreasing
the
size
of
the
rations
it
would
be
possible
to
provide
every
person
with
food
during
three
weeks
at
least
true
it
is
the
supply
was
not
large
enough
to
admit
of
our
gorging
ourselves
but
i
dare
venture
to
say
that
many
there
would
have
lived
on
much
less
had
they
been
thrown
upon
their
own
resources
in
their
own
homes
then
he
told
how
many
times
the
big
guns
had
been
fired
during
the
late
assault
and
stated
that
we
had
two
hundred
and
fifty
rounds
of
ammunition
remaining
for
the
cannon
he
claimed
that
it
was
possible
for
us
to
hold
the
fort
even
though
we
did
not
use
the
heavy
weapons
and
showed
that
we
could
yet
put
up
as
much
of
a
fight
as
leger
army
would
be
able
to
stomach
after
all
these
details
he
described
to
the
men
what
would
likely
be
their
fate
in
event
of
surrender
declaring
that
we
had
every
reason
and
the
ability
to
hold
the
fort
if
we
were
so
minded
and
urged
us
to
be
men
rather
than
cowards
it
was
a
good
speech
and
one
which
should
have
put
heart
into
the
veriest
militiaman
that
ever
pretended
to
be
a
soldier
but
to
my
surprise
i
could
see
on
the
faces
of
those
who
had
talked
surrender
the
loudest
an
expression
telling
that
the
words
passed
by
them
as
does
the
wind
when
we
were
dismissed
the
contention
was
greater
than
before
the
colonel
spoke
and
i
began
to
believe
it
would
have
been
better
had
he
held
his
peace
for
surely
it
seemed
as
if
they
believed
his
words
of
cheer
were
but
proof
that
he
shared
their
fears
during
the
evening
one
of
the
bolder
poltroons
declared
it
was
the
duty
of
all
the
garrison
in
order
to
save
their
lives
to
force
colonel
gansevoort
to
do
as
they
desired
and
while
the
talk
was
the
hottest
sergeant
corney
broke
loose
as
he
afterward
expressed
it
this
lad
an
i
he
said
laying
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
after
attracting
the
attention
of
all
within
sound
of
his
voice
have
within
a
short
time
seen
just
such
scoundrelly
curs
as
you
are
provin
yourselves
to
be
we
have
heard
them
cry
out
against
a
commander
who
was
fitted
to
lead
brave
men
and
their
blood
is
not
yet
dry
on
the
banks
of
the
oriskany
they
forced
general
herkimer
into
an
ambush
against
his
better
judgment
against
his
will
an
at
the
first
volley
from
painted
wretches
they
turned
tail
until
that
time
i
had
thought
an
indian
was
the
meanest
specimen
of
humanity
on
the
face
of
the
earth
but
i
have
come
to
know
different
an
am
yet
gettin
fresh
proof
if
you
talk
so
boldly
of
what
leger
promises
are
worth
why
do
you
put
to
the
test
if
you
believe
death
by
starvation
awaits
you
here
an
that
all
the
heart
of
man
can
desire
is
to
be
found
among
yonder
yellin
imps
why
do
you
make
an
exchange
the
garrison
would
be
the
stronger
for
your
absence
an
if
it
so
be
any
man
here
wants
to
consort
with
the
red
wolves
i
who
pride
myself
on
never
yet
havin
disobeyed
a
military
order
will
stand
by
an
help
him
to
leave
the
fort
for
a
moment
after
the
old
man
ceased
speaking
i
fully
expected
he
would
be
set
upon
and
by
those
whom
he
had
so
severely
lashed
with
his
tongue
that
no
move
toward
open
violence
was
attempted
simply
gave
proof
that
they
were
the
cowards
he
had
accused
them
of
being
but
i
believed
it
was
possible
to
see
in
their
faces
that
his
ironical
advice
might
bear
fruit
and
so
i
told
him
when
the
opportunity
came
more
than
one
of
them
has
had
it
in
his
mind
to
desert
an
go
over
to
the
enemy
i
said
whereupon
he
replied
as
if
the
possibility
gave
him
great
satisfaction
i
wish
they
might
it
true
i
said
more
than
i
meant
when
declarin
my
willingness
to
help
get
away
but
i
promise
you
noel
campbell
that
my
hand
never
will
be
raised
to
stop
them
if
they
try
any
sich
fool
trick
when
my
lads
were
together
in
the
barracks
once
more
and
had
settled
down
for
the
night
none
of
us
having
been
detailed
for
the
thought
of
what
i
fancied
i
saw
on
the
faces
of
the
mutineers
troubled
me
not
a
little
and
instead
of
lying
down
to
sleep
with
the
majority
of
my
comrades
i
called
peter
sitz
and
sergeant
corney
aside
urging
that
one
or
the
other
go
to
colonel
gansevoort
for
the
purpose
of
telling
him
what
it
was
possible
some
of
the
garrison
might
attempt
to
do
before
morning
peter
sitz
claimed
that
since
he
was
not
a
soldier
he
had
no
right
to
make
what
might
seem
to
the
commandant
like
a
suggestion
and
shoved
all
the
responsibility
on
the
sergeant
the
old
man
declared
as
he
had
previously
that
the
men
might
do
as
they
pleased
that
if
it
was
possible
to
stop
them
by
a
single
word
his
lips
should
remain
closed
whereupon
i
suggested
that
if
the
men
should
desert
in
however
small
numbers
they
might
leave
some
portion
of
the
fortification
unguarded
which
would
work
to
the
peril
of
all
and
insisted
if
the
sergeant
would
not
do
what
he
might
to
prevent
the
desertion
it
was
at
least
our
duty
to
so
act
that
the
remainder
of
the
garrison
would
not
be
put
in
jeopardy
because
of
their
folly
not
until
i
had
spoken
at
some
length
would
the
old
soldier
give
any
heed
and
then
upon
a
suggestion
from
peter
sitz
he
said
this
much
i
willin
to
do
an
no
more
from
now
till
mornin
i
make
it
my
business
although
clearly
i
am
goin
beyond
the
bounds
of
ordinary
duty
to
move
to
an
fro
around
the
fort
an
will
summon
the
minute
boys
in
case
any
point
is
left
unguarded
both
jacob
and
i
proposed
to
share
the
labor
with
him
but
he
would
have
none
of
it
stay
where
you
are
he
said
for
i
not
minded
you
shall
do
that
which
may
disgruntle
the
commandant
when
he
learns
that
we
took
it
upon
ourselves
to
look
after
the
safety
of
the
garrison
without
orders
from
him
there
be
a
good
chance
for
a
row
i
stand
the
brunt
of
it
alone
without
draggin
you
lads
into
the
scrape
i
knew
from
the
expression
on
his
face
that
any
attempt
at
argument
with
him
at
the
time
would
be
useless
therefore
held
my
peace
but
had
it
in
mind
that
by
thus
interfering
he
might
be
committing
an
offence
such
as
the
commandant
would
not
readily
forget
if
any
number
of
men
should
desert
on
this
night
there
could
not
be
any
question
but
that
we
having
had
an
inkling
of
it
might
justly
be
held
accountable
but
yet
i
was
not
pleased
at
the
thought
of
doing
or
suffering
to
be
done
that
which
the
old
soldier
had
set
his
face
against
however
as
has
been
said
i
could
have
done
nothing
to
change
matters
save
by
going
to
the
commandant
and
therefore
remained
in
the
barracks
mightily
uncomfortable
in
mind
but
trying
my
best
at
holding
conversation
with
jacob
on
indifferent
subjects
the
majority
of
my
company
had
no
idea
of
what
might
be
done
that
night
therefore
they
lay
down
to
sleep
as
usual
jacob
and
i
seeking
the
open
air
after
we
found
it
was
impossible
to
take
interest
in
any
subject
save
that
which
lay
just
at
that
time
nearest
our
hearts
we
paced
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
barracks
taking
good
care
not
to
disturb
the
sleepers
until
perhaps
half
an
hour
before
midnight
and
then
the
sergeant
came
up
looking
much
like
a
man
who
has
just
settled
a
very
disagreeable
question
well
it
done
he
said
abruptly
an
at
this
time
i
reckon
there
be
less
fools
in
the
world
what
do
you
mean
i
cried
excitedly
for
although
expecting
to
hear
that
a
certain
number
of
men
had
deserted
i
could
not
but
feel
astonishment
when
the
suspicions
thus
became
a
certainty
five
of
the
cowards
have
deserted
countin
that
leger
will
receive
with
open
arms
they
had
a
good
deal
to
say
about
the
need
of
somethin
to
fill
up
their
stomachs
an
i
reckon
that
within
four
twenty
hours
sich
a
question
as
that
wo
give
any
further
trouble
how
did
they
go
jacob
asked
eagerly
out
through
the
an
over
the
stockade
how
did
it
happen
that
only
five
started
the
rest
of
the
mutinous
ones
were
not
quite
sich
fools
when
it
came
to
the
last
pinch
an
i
allowin
we
well
rid
of
those
who
have
gone
save
that
they
can
carry
information
to
leger
of
a
kind
he
be
glad
to
receive
that
was
a
possibility
which
i
had
failed
to
realize
until
this
moment
and
immediately
the
knowledge
came
i
understood
clearly
that
it
was
our
duty
to
have
notified
the
commandant
at
once
of
what
we
suspected
for
if
the
enemy
learned
that
we
were
on
short
allowance
and
with
a
scarcity
of
ammunition
as
he
certainly
would
from
these
men
who
were
bound
to
make
matters
appear
as
bad
as
possible
we
might
expect
more
than
one
vigorous
assault
within
a
very
short
time
did
you
stand
quietly
by
while
they
went
jacob
asked
in
a
tone
of
reproach
i
was
quite
sich
a
fool
as
that
lad
even
though
i
did
advise
to
go
i
kept
my
eye
on
the
gang
however
an
was
hidden
in
the
when
they
made
the
final
plans
those
who
had
been
left
behind
seemed
to
be
frightened
an
i
reckon
there
be
less
show
of
mutiny
in
this
fort
mornin
than
we
seen
in
the
past
four
an
twenty
hours
jacob
and
i
would
have
insisted
that
the
old
soldier
tell
us
more
regarding
the
desertion
although
it
was
evident
he
had
imparted
all
the
information
at
his
command
but
he
bent
on
getting
some
rest
before
morning
entered
the
barracks
and
we
could
hardly
do
better
than
follow
him
although
it
had
not
seemed
possible
i
would
close
my
eyes
in
slumber
that
night
with
so
much
which
was
disagreeable
to
keep
me
awake
i
did
fall
asleep
and
that
right
soon
after
i
lay
down
by
the
side
of
jacob
we
were
astir
very
early
next
morning
through
some
whim
of
sergeant
corney
who
insisted
that
the
minute
boys
should
be
the
first
to
make
an
appearance
and
i
left
the
barracks
fully
expecting
to
find
a
scene
of
confusion
outside
matters
were
much
as
they
had
been
the
night
previous
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
as
yet
the
commandant
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
five
of
his
men
had
gone
over
to
the
enemy
however
that
may
have
been
no
signs
of
disquietude
among
the
officers
were
apparent
until
the
sun
was
two
hours
or
more
high
and
then
half
a
dozen
men
belonging
to
the
same
company
as
those
who
had
deserted
were
summoned
to
headquarters
you
might
save
the
commandant
a
good
bit
of
trouble
by
telling
him
what
you
know
jacob
suggested
to
sergeant
corney
and
the
latter
replied
grimly
i
not
sich
a
fool
it
one
thing
to
let
a
lot
of
sneaks
get
away
when
you
think
the
garrison
will
be
the
better
off
without
an
quite
another
to
own
up
to
your
superior
officer
that
you
winked
at
desertion
i
keep
a
close
tongue
in
my
head
an
so
will
them
as
are
my
friends
with
this
the
old
man
walked
away
leaving
us
gazing
at
each
other
in
something
very
like
astonishment
for
we
understood
by
his
tone
that
he
was
much
the
same
as
threatening
us
in
case
we
should
take
it
upon
ourselves
to
tell
what
we
knew
regarding
the
matter
before
ten
all
of
the
garrison
were
aware
that
five
of
the
force
had
deserted
and
those
men
who
had
been
loudest
spoken
regarding
the
wisdom
of
surrendering
were
now
moving
about
very
uneasily
doubtless
fearing
they
might
be
called
upon
to
answer
for
some
of
the
unsoldierly
remarks
in
which
they
had
indulged
there
was
no
real
confusion
in
the
fort
but
a
general
air
of
disquietude
and
apprehension
which
i
thought
quite
wholesome
since
it
caused
every
man
to
do
his
duty
more
promptly
and
more
thoroughly
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
done
when
those
who
had
been
summoned
to
headquarters
appeared
on
the
once
more
they
were
surrounded
by
eager
comrades
all
anxious
to
know
what
had
been
said
to
them
but
they
could
give
very
little
definite
information
and
were
unwilling
to
talk
openly
regarding
the
matter
for
the
reason
as
i
fancied
that
some
of
them
being
privy
to
the
desertion
had
denied
such
fact
to
the
officers
well
by
noon
it
seemed
as
if
the
matter
had
entirely
blown
over
everything
went
along
much
as
on
the
day
previous
save
that
according
to
my
idea
there
was
a
more
healthy
tone
among
the
men
because
we
no
longer
heard
talk
of
surrender
and
i
suggested
that
perhaps
colonel
gansevoort
was
as
glad
to
be
rid
of
his
mutinous
soldiers
as
sergeant
corney
had
been
to
see
them
depart
it
goes
without
saying
that
all
of
us
whether
on
duty
or
not
kept
a
sharper
lookout
over
the
enemy
encampment
than
ever
before
for
there
was
good
reason
to
expect
that
leger
would
order
another
assault
but
not
one
of
us
dreamed
of
that
horrible
spectacle
which
was
to
be
presented
much
as
if
thayendanega
murderers
were
of
a
mind
to
give
deserters
such
a
lesson
as
could
never
be
forgotten
the
afternoon
passed
quietly
and
without
unusual
incident
but
when
the
sun
was
just
about
to
set
we
observed
the
indians
crossing
the
river
from
their
encampment
to
the
meadow
at
a
point
near
the
creek
where
it
was
possible
for
us
to
hold
them
in
plain
view
while
they
were
yet
beyond
range
of
any
except
the
heavier
guns
which
could
not
be
brought
to
bear
upon
them
the
first
movement
was
made
by
a
party
of
a
dozen
or
more
who
seemed
to
be
carrying
heavy
burdens
on
their
backs
and
this
was
such
an
unusual
thing
for
a
redskin
to
do
that
we
were
keenly
curious
this
first
squad
was
followed
by
a
veritable
swarm
of
the
painted
murderers
and
i
said
nervously
to
sergeant
corney
who
was
standing
near
me
at
the
moment
the
savages
are
goin
to
try
their
hand
at
an
assault
an
we
like
to
have
warm
work
before
mornin
there
little
fear
anything
of
that
kind
will
happen
lad
the
painted
devil
never
lived
who
was
willin
to
stand
up
an
fight
face
to
face
then
why
are
they
goin
out
of
their
encampment
like
a
swarm
of
bees
there
some
mischief
afoot
though
what
it
is
i
ca
rightly
make
out
perhaps
leger
has
summoned
to
another
powwow
in
order
that
they
may
know
of
our
condition
as
has
been
told
by
the
deserters
in
a
very
few
moments
it
was
positive
that
this
guess
was
not
correct
for
instead
of
crossing
the
creek
to
approach
the
british
encampment
the
indians
halted
when
they
were
about
midway
between
the
fort
the
camps
of
the
british
soldiers
and
the
quarters
of
the
tories
it
was
at
a
point
where
every
man
on
either
side
could
see
what
was
being
done
and
yet
so
far
away
that
save
by
a
sortie
no
one
could
molest
them
i
dare
venture
to
say
that
every
man
in
the
garrison
save
perhaps
the
officers
was
watching
intently
the
movements
of
thayendanega
gang
and
it
was
as
if
the
knowledge
of
what
was
about
to
be
done
burst
upon
us
all
at
the
same
instant
a
low
murmur
of
horror
involuntarily
came
from
our
lips
and
men
said
in
whispers
one
to
another
the
blood
suddenly
leaving
their
bronzed
faces
the
indians
are
going
to
torture
prisoners
by
this
time
we
could
see
that
two
stout
posts
had
been
set
firmly
in
the
earth
and
around
them
were
heaped
piles
of
light
wood
such
as
the
squaws
and
children
were
bringing
up
in
great
quantities
thayendanega
bloodthirsty
crew
was
bent
on
showing
us
what
would
be
our
fate
if
we
fell
into
their
clutches
when
the
first
shock
of
horror
had
passed
away
in
a
measure
there
came
the
question
as
to
who
might
be
the
victims
and
then
those
who
had
talked
mutiny
and
urged
their
fellows
on
to
rankest
insubordination
turned
pale
as
death
while
many
of
them
walked
totteringly
away
as
if
unable
to
control
their
limbs
we
all
believed
and
with
good
reason
that
those
unfortunates
who
were
to
suffer
death
at
the
hands
of
the
most
men
god
ever
made
were
none
other
than
the
deserters
from
our
ranks
during
the
assault
not
one
of
the
garrison
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
certain
it
was
that
the
besiegers
had
not
left
the
vicinity
of
the
fort
for
such
length
of
time
as
would
be
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
procure
captives
elsewhere
therefore
did
we
know
beyond
a
peradventure
who
the
victims
would
be
but
why
only
two
were
to
suffer
was
something
at
which
we
could
not
even
so
much
as
guess
i
saw
colonel
gansevoort
and
several
of
the
officers
come
out
from
headquarters
having
most
likely
been
informed
as
to
what
was
going
on
and
when
they
stood
where
it
was
possible
to
have
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
horrible
preparations
the
entire
garrison
of
fort
schuyler
were
assembled
as
spectators
can
not
something
be
done
for
the
poor
fellows
i
heard
a
man
behind
me
ask
in
a
quavering
tone
and
turning
i
saw
one
who
had
declared
most
vehemently
but
a
few
hours
previous
that
if
we
would
surrender
the
fort
we
could
be
assured
beyond
question
of
such
treatment
as
civilized
people
give
to
prisoners
of
war
no
one
answered
his
question
and
in
a
whisper
i
repeated
it
to
sergeant
corney
whereupon
he
shook
his
head
decidedly
the
commander
who
would
make
a
sortie
for
the
purpose
of
savin
only
two
lives
would
be
guilty
of
criminal
folly
the
old
soldier
said
emphatically
if
those
who
are
to
suffer
were
colonel
nearest
friends
still
must
he
remain
here
idle
rather
than
put
in
jeopardy
all
the
garrison
as
it
is
those
painted
devils
are
givin
us
sich
a
lesson
as
will
cause
every
man
here
to
fight
until
the
death
rather
than
so
much
as
hint
that
we
might
trust
to
the
enemy
promises
it
a
harsh
remedy
the
harshest
man
could
imagine
but
yet
there
are
an
hundred
or
more
lookin
on
at
this
minute
who
need
it
i
can
not
make
the
feeblest
attempt
at
describing
the
horror
which
took
possession
of
me
as
i
realized
that
we
could
make
no
effort
toward
saving
the
unfortunate
men
who
were
not
the
less
to
be
pitied
because
they
had
brought
about
their
own
misery
and
unable
longer
to
gaze
at
what
was
so
soon
to
be
such
a
terrible
scene
i
turned
away
with
a
mind
to
shut
myself
up
in
the
barracks
chapter
xv
the
torture
there
was
one
odd
thing
i
noted
while
turning
away
sick
at
heart
which
was
that
those
friends
of
the
deserters
the
men
whose
voices
had
been
raised
highest
against
colonel
gansevoort
because
he
would
not
surrender
the
fort
at
leger
bidding
had
no
word
to
say
now
that
their
friends
were
in
such
dire
distress
while
those
who
had
struggled
to
quell
the
mutiny
were
asking
loudly
if
it
were
not
possible
to
do
something
toward
saving
the
lives
of
the
unfortunate
men
twenty
or
more
of
the
bolder
spirits
among
whom
was
sergeant
corney
were
making
ready
to
ask
permission
of
the
commandant
to
their
creeping
out
of
the
fort
on
that
side
nearest
the
river
and
then
trying
by
a
sudden
dash
to
rescue
the
prisoners
even
the
slight
experience
which
i
had
had
in
savage
warfare
was
sufficient
to
show
me
that
there
was
nothing
which
we
could
do
in
behalf
of
the
wretched
men
and
any
plan
however
promising
could
not
fail
of
exposing
the
entire
garrison
to
the
keenest
peril
there
could
be
no
question
but
that
the
enemy
hoped
we
might
be
so
venturesome
as
to
sally
out
and
i
doubt
if
there
was
a
man
within
the
fortification
who
did
not
feel
convinced
that
leger
troops
were
ready
to
swoop
down
in
assault
at
the
first
show
of
our
having
sent
away
any
portion
of
our
force
all
knew
that
we
inside
the
fortification
were
powerless
to
aid
those
who
had
wilfully
gone
to
their
doom
and
none
better
than
those
same
brave
fellows
who
were
ready
to
risk
their
lives
in
behalf
of
comrades
who
would
have
worked
disaster
to
the
entire
garrison
yet
they
could
not
stand
idle
without
at
least
a
show
of
willingness
to
face
danger
in
the
hope
of
saving
life
the
one
lesson
which
all
of
us
learned
at
this
time
was
as
to
how
much
dependence
might
be
placed
upon
the
word
of
the
british
commander
he
had
declared
that
he
would
protect
all
who
came
to
him
promising
to
serve
the
king
and
yet
when
the
five
foolish
cowards
from
our
garrison
presented
themselves
they
were
given
over
to
the
merciless
savages
much
as
honest
people
give
to
their
children
i
had
turned
away
from
the
scene
sick
with
horror
even
though
the
fiendish
work
had
not
yet
begun
but
as
i
stood
near
the
barracks
trembling
in
every
limb
the
thought
came
that
perhaps
our
deserters
were
not
the
ones
for
whom
the
stakes
were
intended
of
course
it
would
be
equally
terrible
to
see
any
human
being
tortured
to
death
but
at
the
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
frightfulness
of
it
would
in
some
degree
be
lessened
if
it
were
strangers
who
suffered
and
straightway
i
went
back
to
the
walls
taking
station
by
the
side
of
jacob
as
i
strained
my
eyes
to
see
who
the
indians
led
out
where
is
the
sergeant
i
asked
in
a
whisper
gone
in
company
with
a
dozen
others
to
ask
permission
of
the
commandant
to
leave
the
fort
for
a
short
time
do
they
want
to
compass
their
own
death
i
asked
angrily
i
dare
venture
to
say
every
tory
in
yonder
encampment
is
ready
to
cut
off
any
who
from
motives
of
mercy
and
pity
venture
beyond
the
walls
ay
so
my
father
believes
he
says
that
colonel
gansevoort
can
not
in
justice
to
the
remainder
of
the
force
allow
such
a
sacrifice
of
life
as
would
result
from
a
sortie
but
we
are
not
yet
certain
that
it
is
our
deserters
who
are
to
be
put
to
death
i
suggested
and
at
the
moment
a
hoarse
cry
went
up
from
all
that
company
of
spectators
accompanied
by
from
the
warriors
and
hoots
and
yells
from
the
squaws
and
fiendish
children
the
unfortunate
men
were
being
brought
across
the
river
in
triumph
and
then
a
deep
hush
fell
upon
our
garrison
as
every
person
within
the
walls
bent
forward
anxiously
to
get
a
glimpse
of
those
who
were
being
carried
to
the
theatre
of
a
terrible
death
the
unfortunate
prisoners
were
yet
too
far
away
for
me
to
distinguish
their
features
when
a
soldier
standing
near
by
a
man
whom
i
recognized
as
one
of
those
who
had
howled
most
loudly
for
surrender
cried
with
a
groan
as
of
mortal
agony
there
is
seth
morton
this
was
the
name
of
one
of
the
deserters
and
there
was
no
longer
any
hope
but
that
the
savages
were
ready
to
show
us
how
our
own
people
could
die
at
this
moment
the
party
with
whom
sergeant
corney
had
gone
to
the
commandant
for
permission
to
attempt
a
rescue
came
up
and
but
one
glance
at
their
faces
was
needed
to
show
that
the
request
had
been
denied
he
would
let
you
go
i
whispered
as
the
old
man
stood
by
my
side
no
lad
an
we
should
have
had
better
sense
than
to
ask
him
a
commandant
who
would
agree
to
sich
a
plan
has
no
right
to
expect
his
troops
can
rely
upon
his
showin
good
judgment
in
a
tight
fix
what
did
he
say
he
talked
like
a
gentleman
who
speaks
with
his
friends
instead
of
roarin
out
that
we
were
all
kinds
of
idjuts
as
another
commander
might
have
done
he
told
us
exactly
what
would
be
the
result
if
any
of
us
attempted
to
leave
the
fort
an
wound
up
by
sayin
that
if
his
own
brother
was
in
the
hands
of
the
red
devils
he
would
not
consider
it
justice
by
the
garrison
even
to
let
one
man
venture
forth
he
only
told
us
the
truth
an
i
not
sorry
i
went
to
him
even
though
nothin
came
of
it
for
it
ai
cheerful
to
stand
still
without
makin
a
little
bit
of
a
try
while
sich
work
as
that
yonder
is
goin
on
when
the
prisoners
had
been
taken
across
the
stream
the
savages
lost
no
time
in
setting
about
their
terrible
work
and
although
so
many
years
have
elapsed
since
then
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
set
down
that
which
i
know
was
done
while
the
poor
fellows
were
being
bound
to
the
stakes
jacob
and
i
ran
into
the
barracks
where
we
remained
trying
to
shut
out
from
our
ears
the
yells
and
whoops
which
told
of
what
was
going
on
and
i
would
have
suffered
the
same
bitter
death
but
for
what
you
did
dear
lad
i
said
hardly
able
to
control
my
voice
do
think
of
it
noel
he
replied
soothingly
as
he
pressed
my
hand
an
above
everything
do
give
me
the
credit
all
our
company
had
a
part
in
that
rescue
ay
yet
they
never
known
of
our
peril
but
for
you
an
it
was
you
alone
when
they
were
arrived
who
braved
the
danger
of
coming
across
the
encampment
to
the
lodge
talk
of
somethin
else
noel
campbell
jacob
cried
fiercely
even
though
the
colonel
knows
best
what
should
be
done
it
seems
cowardly
for
us
to
be
sittin
here
in
safety
while
those
poor
fellows
are
sufferin
all
that
men
can
i
tried
to
do
as
he
would
have
me
but
one
can
readily
understand
that
at
such
a
time
it
would
be
impossible
to
think
of
anything
save
that
which
was
being
done
within
sight
of
all
the
garrison
it
seemed
to
me
like
a
very
long
time
before
the
sergeant
joined
us
and
then
i
knew
that
the
unfortunate
men
were
out
of
their
misery
at
last
they
have
paid
a
fearful
price
for
their
folly
the
old
man
said
solemnly
but
by
thus
dyin
they
ensured
the
holdin
of
this
fort
for
there
not
a
man
within
the
walls
who
would
delight
in
drawin
his
last
breath
at
the
post
of
duty
rather
than
take
the
chances
of
sich
protection
as
leger
has
shown
he
ready
to
give
we
have
no
more
mutiny
an
all
hands
will
be
starved
to
death
before
the
enemy
gets
possession
of
the
fortification
what
about
the
other
three
men
jacob
asked
in
a
whisper
not
daring
to
trust
his
voice
lest
it
should
betray
the
fear
in
his
heart
i
reckon
their
turn
will
come
soon
perhaps
night
thayendanega
red
men
ca
afford
to
waste
their
victims
but
hark
ye
lads
it
wo
do
for
you
to
moon
over
what
is
enough
to
turn
any
man
blood
to
water
take
a
brisk
walk
up
an
down
the
for
half
an
hour
an
then
come
to
bed
i
thinkin
we
may
have
a
bit
of
work
cut
out
for
us
within
the
next
four
an
twenty
hours
of
what
kind
i
asked
not
inclined
to
follow
the
old
man
advice
so
far
as
to
venture
out
while
the
howling
indians
were
making
night
something
of
which
to
be
afraid
it
stands
to
reason
that
before
the
deserters
were
turned
over
to
the
painted
wolves
leger
got
from
them
all
the
information
concernin
this
fort
which
they
could
give
the
british
general
now
knows
that
we
any
too
much
ammunition
for
the
cannon
an
it
be
odd
if
he
do
give
us
a
chance
to
spend
a
good
bit
more
of
it
this
seemed
a
plausible
line
of
reasoning
and
yet
i
was
not
in
the
lightest
degree
troubled
by
the
possibility
i
had
known
so
much
of
horror
during
the
past
few
hours
that
an
assault
however
desperate
was
something
to
be
courted
rather
than
feared
sergeant
corney
smoked
his
pipe
long
and
furiously
that
night
as
he
sat
in
the
barracks
giving
no
heed
as
to
whether
we
followed
his
advice
and
we
two
lads
sat
side
by
side
with
little
inclination
to
indulge
in
conversation
one
by
one
our
boys
and
trembling
entered
the
some
even
going
so
far
as
to
lie
down
but
positive
am
i
that
never
an
eye
was
closed
in
slumber
during
all
that
night
and
every
one
of
us
welcomed
the
first
rays
of
the
rising
sun
as
if
years
had
passed
since
he
last
showed
his
face
before
another
six
hours
passed
we
had
good
proof
that
those
who
deserted
gave
all
the
information
at
their
command
to
general
leger
regarding
the
condition
of
affairs
at
the
fort
and
yet
never
a
word
was
spoken
against
them
because
of
the
frightful
punishment
which
followed
their
treachery
from
what
our
party
of
minute
boys
had
seen
up
to
this
time
the
work
of
the
siege
was
not
pushed
vigorously
by
the
britishers
and
even
the
little
which
was
done
had
been
performed
by
the
tories
it
is
true
that
the
parallels
were
run
unpleasantly
near
the
fort
yet
had
the
besiegers
so
desired
there
would
have
been
twice
as
much
to
show
for
their
efforts
on
the
morning
after
two
of
the
deserters
had
been
tortured
to
death
it
began
to
look
as
if
our
people
would
have
little
time
for
idleness
the
enemy
trenches
were
filled
with
men
regulars
as
well
as
tories
all
of
whom
worked
with
a
will
and
at
different
points
sharpshooters
were
stationed
to
pick
off
our
sentinels
now
this
is
somethin
like
business
sergeant
corney
said
as
if
the
sense
of
additional
danger
was
most
pleasing
to
him
barry
leger
has
just
found
out
that
there
a
chance
of
takin
this
fort
by
storm
from
now
on
we
have
our
hands
full
jacob
and
i
were
in
the
barracks
trying
to
sleep
when
the
old
man
burst
in
upon
us
with
the
remark
i
have
set
down
and
as
he
spoke
he
began
furbishing
up
his
rifle
with
unusual
care
have
you
any
especial
work
on
hand
i
asked
looking
curiously
at
him
ay
lad
that
what
i
have
this
garrison
ai
in
any
very
great
danger
of
runnin
short
of
ammunition
for
the
small
arms
an
we
to
give
the
enemy
lead
in
the
place
of
iron
for
a
spell
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
somewhat
petulantly
for
it
seemed
as
if
the
old
man
was
making
sport
of
me
only
that
we
given
the
enemy
sharpshooters
a
chance
all
the
forenoon
without
interferin
to
any
great
extent
an
now
we
countin
on
our
turn
fifty
men
have
been
detailed
to
pick
off
as
many
of
force
as
we
can
draw
a
bead
on
i
reckon
workin
in
the
trenches
wo
be
a
healthy
job
from
this
time
on
colonel
gansevoort
allows
to
show
the
britishers
that
he
can
stir
his
stumps
if
needs
must
the
sergeant
left
the
barracks
without
giving
us
further
information
but
we
soon
learned
that
our
people
were
to
be
kept
sharply
up
to
their
work
instead
of
being
allowed
to
spend
five
hours
out
of
every
six
in
lounging
around
the
force
of
sharpshooters
to
which
sergeant
corney
was
assigned
had
been
stationed
on
the
north
and
east
sides
of
the
fort
where
they
could
command
a
view
of
the
british
and
tory
encampments
and
the
trenches
another
company
of
fifty
was
told
off
especially
for
the
while
we
minute
boys
were
ordered
to
keep
at
least
ten
of
our
number
constantly
on
watch
over
the
from
which
point
the
best
view
of
the
indian
encampment
could
be
had
yet
others
of
the
force
were
detailed
to
go
from
one
division
to
another
of
those
i
have
named
in
order
to
lend
a
hand
in
case
it
might
become
necessary
and
thus
it
was
we
no
longer
had
any
loungers
on
the
or
near
the
barracks
the
orders
were
that
every
effort
be
made
to
pick
off
such
of
the
enemy
as
offered
themselves
for
targets
and
before
the
day
had
come
to
an
end
leger
men
must
have
begun
to
understand
that
the
siege
of
fort
schuyler
was
no
longer
the
affair
which
it
had
been
my
lads
could
not
have
been
stationed
in
any
other
position
where
they
would
have
been
as
well
satisfied
for
thus
were
they
fighting
the
savages
who
had
threatened
to
ravage
the
mohawk
valley
and
every
time
we
made
a
successful
shot
it
was
much
as
if
we
struck
a
blow
in
defence
of
our
homes
thayendanega
braves
did
not
give
us
very
much
opportunity
to
display
our
skill
as
marksmen
however
within
five
minutes
after
the
curs
discovered
that
we
were
straining
every
effort
to
reduce
their
number
they
hugged
the
encampment
mighty
snug
and
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
general
leger
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
make
them
obey
any
order
which
might
necessitate
their
coming
within
our
line
of
fire
in
addition
to
this
slow
method
of
whipping
a
large
force
i
noted
the
fact
that
twenty
men
or
more
were
at
work
moving
one
of
the
guns
in
the
northwest
bastion
and
was
not
a
little
puzzled
to
make
out
why
such
a
piece
of
work
should
be
done
at
a
time
when
we
could
not
afford
to
use
the
cannon
any
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
my
surprise
was
not
lessened
when
the
laborers
with
great
difficulty
transferred
the
big
gun
directly
to
our
station
mounting
it
almost
directly
over
the
port
after
which
six
rounds
of
ammunition
were
brought
from
the
magazine
and
placed
where
it
could
be
got
at
handily
does
the
commandant
think
we
lads
can
handle
that
cannon
properly
i
asked
of
the
corporal
who
was
superintending
the
work
and
he
replied
with
a
laugh
of
satisfaction
i
reckon
he
was
thinkin
very
much
about
you
when
he
gave
orders
to
have
the
gun
moved
that
to
help
out
on
our
it
carry
a
ball
farther
an
with
truer
aim
than
any
other
piece
in
the
fort
as
i
know
havin
had
somewhat
to
do
with
all
of
what
do
you
mean
by
a
i
asked
in
perplexity
an
why
should
the
best
gun
be
brought
here
well
you
see
lad
the
chances
are
them
bloody
sneaks
will
soon
try
to
work
the
same
deviltry
which
we
had
to
look
at
idly
last
night
for
it
stands
to
reason
that
all
who
deserted
from
this
fort
fell
into
their
clutches
the
next
time
they
start
in
to
kill
a
man
by
inches
they
out
of
range
we
plump
a
ball
into
the
middle
of
the
gang
that
make
em
hop
a
bit
i
laughed
in
glee
at
the
prospect
of
turning
the
tables
on
the
bloodthirsty
wretches
but
very
shortly
came
the
thought
that
the
unfortunate
prisoners
would
be
in
as
much
danger
as
the
savages
and
this
i
suggested
to
the
corporal
whereupon
he
said
gravely
we
hope
the
first
shot
kills
as
many
as
are
trussed
up
to
the
stakes
lad
because
a
quick
death
is
the
only
favor
we
can
do
for
the
poor
fellows
it
would
indeed
be
a
mercy
to
kill
the
prisoners
if
we
could
not
save
their
lives
but
of
a
verity
we
were
come
to
hard
lines
when
it
was
to
be
hoped
our
missiles
would
slay
those
who
had
been
our
comrades
i
believed
all
the
garrison
were
better
content
now
that
colonel
gansevoort
was
finding
work
for
every
man
certainly
there
was
less
chance
for
searching
out
bugbears
when
they
were
busily
engaged
and
each
of
us
felt
a
grim
satisfaction
at
knowing
that
we
inflicted
some
punishment
on
the
enemy
however
slight
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
our
sharpshooters
found
all
the
targets
they
desired
else
had
we
wiped
leger
force
out
in
a
twinkling
but
there
were
in
the
white
portion
of
his
army
a
sufficient
number
who
scorned
to
show
fear
of
what
we
might
be
able
to
do
and
these
kept
our
men
so
engaged
that
the
reports
of
the
rifles
were
ringing
out
almost
without
intermission
as
i
have
already
said
we
minute
boys
had
but
little
opportunity
to
show
our
skill
after
the
first
hour
because
the
savages
kept
so
close
within
their
lodges
but
now
and
then
we
had
a
crack
at
a
painted
figure
and
seldom
missed
our
aim
as
the
day
wore
away
it
became
evident
that
the
indians
counted
on
torturing
the
remainder
of
their
prisoners
as
before
and
instead
of
suffering
from
the
sickness
of
horror
as
i
had
hours
previous
there
was
in
my
mind
a
most
pleasing
anticipation
of
what
would
be
the
result
half
an
hour
before
sunset
they
began
setting
up
new
posts
a
fact
which
told
that
leger
had
indeed
turned
over
to
them
all
the
deserters
word
was
passed
around
the
fort
that
the
commandant
counted
on
putting
an
end
to
their
cruel
sport
if
perchance
the
distance
was
not
greater
than
he
had
estimated
and
by
sunset
every
person
inside
the
walls
save
those
who
were
acting
as
sentinels
on
the
westerly
side
had
their
faces
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
indian
encampment
it
was
claimed
that
the
corporal
with
whom
i
had
previously
spoken
was
the
best
gunner
in
the
command
and
to
him
had
been
entrusted
the
work
of
sighting
the
cannon
he
had
already
charged
it
heavily
and
when
the
savages
began
setting
up
new
posts
he
knew
the
time
had
come
to
look
for
the
proper
range
the
corporal
had
no
need
to
call
for
a
crew
to
aid
him
an
hundred
pairs
of
hands
were
eagerly
whenever
he
signified
the
desire
to
have
this
thing
or
that
done
and
he
was
more
like
to
suffer
from
a
surplus
of
helpers
than
a
lack
it
looked
much
as
if
colonel
gansevoort
feared
that
while
our
attention
was
attracted
toward
the
fiendish
work
of
the
savages
the
british
and
tory
soldiers
might
make
an
assault
for
he
ordered
the
number
of
sentinels
doubled
and
all
the
spectators
to
be
in
line
weapons
in
hand
that
no
time
might
be
lost
in
case
it
became
necessary
to
move
them
from
one
point
to
another
thayendanega
wolves
did
not
count
on
keeping
us
waiting
very
long
but
as
soon
as
the
sun
had
set
began
crossing
the
river
with
their
unfortunate
prisoners
singing
and
shouting
as
if
the
capture
and
torturing
of
these
unarmed
men
was
some
signal
act
of
bravery
the
corporal
told
off
a
certain
number
of
those
nearest
to
act
as
crew
for
the
gun
explaining
to
them
just
how
they
should
set
about
the
task
of
recharging
when
once
it
had
been
discharged
and
then
the
remainder
of
the
spectators
save
we
minute
boys
who
were
entitled
to
remain
at
our
stations
were
forced
to
fall
back
that
they
might
not
impede
the
work
after
it
was
once
begun
by
this
time
colonel
gansevoort
himself
had
come
up
and
thus
we
understood
that
he
was
to
direct
the
firing
if
our
cannon
could
carry
a
missile
to
the
place
of
torture
then
certain
it
was
the
brutes
would
receive
a
lesson
well
calculated
to
surprise
those
who
were
left
alive
after
the
piece
had
been
discharged
the
commandant
did
not
wait
until
the
horrible
work
was
begun
but
once
the
stakes
were
surrounded
by
the
howling
screaming
dancing
mob
as
they
placed
the
prisoners
in
the
desired
positions
the
corporal
got
the
word
for
which
he
had
been
eagerly
waiting
a
puff
of
dense
white
smoke
a
report
which
was
almost
deafening
to
those
of
us
standing
near
by
rang
out
then
we
could
follow
the
flight
of
the
missile
in
the
air
until
it
struck
as
it
seemed
to
me
within
a
dozen
paces
of
those
bloodthirsty
villains
who
stood
on
the
outside
of
the
throng
and
rebounding
as
does
a
flat
stone
when
a
boy
drives
it
along
the
surface
of
the
water
it
plunged
into
the
very
midst
of
the
fiendish
crew
i
could
see
that
one
of
the
posts
had
been
carried
away
by
the
ball
but
whether
or
no
the
prisoner
was
killed
could
not
be
told
from
so
great
a
distance
and
while
he
was
surrounded
by
such
numbers
it
was
to
be
hoped
the
poor
fellow
had
gone
to
his
final
account
without
pain
as
would
have
been
the
case
had
the
huge
shot
struck
him
the
gunners
did
not
wait
to
see
the
result
of
their
work
but
instantly
the
cannon
was
discharged
every
man
sprang
to
the
task
allotted
him
and
the
savages
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
first
surprise
before
a
second
shot
came
hurtling
among
them
striking
down
half
a
score
before
it
rebounded
i
do
not
believe
forty
seconds
elapsed
before
the
gunners
were
ready
for
the
third
discharge
in
order
to
save
time
they
did
not
wait
to
swab
out
the
piece
and
the
only
preparation
make
by
them
was
to
clear
the
interior
of
smoke
to
tell
it
in
the
fewest
possible
words
the
corporal
had
for
his
target
nearly
the
entire
number
of
indians
who
had
attempted
to
witness
the
torture
while
we
fired
four
shots
and
not
until
then
did
the
crew
get
their
wits
about
them
sufficiently
to
beat
a
retreat
but
the
gun
was
discharged
twice
more
while
they
were
crossing
the
river
and
i
know
for
a
certainty
that
one
boat
was
swamped
while
the
ground
in
the
vicinity
of
the
posts
set
up
for
the
prisoners
seemed
literally
strewn
with
the
dead
and
the
dying
at
that
moment
while
we
were
making
the
air
ring
with
our
shouts
of
triumph
i
saw
a
figure
emerge
from
that
sinister
pile
of
dead
and
maimed
and
come
limpingly
in
the
direction
of
the
fort
moving
evidently
with
great
effort
and
slowly
at
first
i
believed
it
was
a
wounded
indian
who
was
so
crazed
with
pain
or
fear
as
not
to
be
aware
of
the
direction
in
which
he
was
proceeding
and
then
a
cry
went
up
from
the
soldiers
nearabout
me
reuben
cox
reuben
cox
was
he
one
of
the
deserters
i
asked
of
the
corporal
who
his
work
having
been
done
was
leaning
out
over
the
wall
to
watch
the
frightened
sneaks
as
they
scuttled
into
their
lodges
out
of
sight
ay
that
he
was
the
corporal
replied
an
it
looks
much
as
if
he
stood
a
chance
to
gain
the
fort
before
those
painted
beauties
dare
stick
their
noses
out
from
cover
as
we
watched
it
was
possible
to
see
that
the
man
arms
were
tied
behind
him
while
it
seemed
as
if
his
legs
were
fettered
in
some
way
yet
he
was
able
to
take
short
steps
and
in
his
eagerness
to
make
better
speed
he
fell
to
the
ground
again
and
again
rising
only
with
difficulty
the
fugitive
was
a
deserter
from
the
fort
one
who
had
doubtless
given
such
information
to
the
british
general
as
might
work
serious
harm
to
all
of
us
but
yet
never
a
cry
was
heard
from
our
garrison
save
such
as
expressed
hope
that
he
might
escape
the
terrible
doom
from
which
we
had
at
least
temporarily
saved
him
and
all
appeared
eager
for
him
to
gain
the
fortification
even
colonel
gansevoort
seemed
to
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
if
this
man
came
among
us
once
more
it
would
be
necessary
to
treat
him
as
a
deserter
but
to
check
if
possible
pursuit
from
the
british
and
tory
soldiers
he
lined
the
walls
with
men
under
command
to
fire
without
waiting
for
the
word
upon
any
of
the
enemy
who
might
approach
within
range
the
crews
of
the
guns
in
the
northeastern
bastion
were
sent
to
their
posts
of
duty
in
order
that
the
pieces
might
be
used
in
case
an
opportunity
presented
itself
and
in
fact
every
possible
effort
save
the
absolute
sallying
out
of
a
relief
party
was
made
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
man
who
by
all
military
laws
deserved
death
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
did
not
breathe
while
that
poor
struggling
creature
was
straining
every
effort
to
find
a
place
of
refuge
among
those
whom
he
had
wronged
it
was
as
if
the
distance
increased
even
as
he
came
toward
us
and
i
found
it
difficult
to
remain
silent
while
he
stumbled
fell
rose
and
fell
again
during
his
painful
flight
fifty
men
or
more
ran
to
the
ready
to
open
the
gates
if
he
should
draw
near
and
colonel
gansevoort
made
no
effort
to
check
them
i
believe
at
the
moment
that
he
entirely
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
this
man
could
no
longer
claim
the
right
of
entrance
having
forfeited
it
when
he
went
over
to
the
enemy
he
and
all
within
the
walls
saw
before
them
only
a
wretched
prisoner
striving
to
escape
from
those
who
would
torture
him
to
death
and
had
he
been
a
dear
friend
no
greater
anxiety
could
have
been
shown
for
his
safety
not
until
he
was
within
fifty
yards
of
the
walls
of
the
fort
did
a
shot
come
from
the
direction
of
the
indian
encampment
and
then
the
bullet
sped
wide
of
its
mark
from
the
camp
of
the
tories
a
squad
of
men
dashed
out
as
if
intent
on
cutting
off
the
poor
fellow
even
after
he
was
close
under
the
walls
but
a
gun
from
the
northeastern
bastion
hurled
a
shot
uncomfortably
near
sending
them
flying
back
beyond
range
and
five
minutes
later
reuben
cox
was
in
our
midst
as
nearly
dead
from
wounds
and
fatigue
as
he
ever
would
be
again
until
his
final
moment
had
come
chapter
xvi
short
allowance
five
men
had
deserted
from
the
fort
trusting
to
the
promises
made
by
general
leger
and
one
had
returned
after
having
suffered
more
than
death
rejoicing
because
he
was
able
to
be
once
again
with
those
whom
he
had
betrayed
at
the
moment
however
we
had
no
thought
of
the
deserter
but
saw
before
us
only
a
former
comrade
who
had
come
out
from
the
very
jaws
of
death
to
claim
protection
the
poor
fellow
had
been
cruelly
cut
on
the
legs
and
arms
by
the
savages
while
they
were
bringing
him
across
the
river
and
had
lost
much
blood
his
face
and
hands
were
covered
with
huge
blisters
and
it
was
not
necessary
either
sergeant
corney
or
i
should
ask
how
he
came
by
them
for
we
knew
through
bitterest
experience
what
the
squaws
and
children
would
do
when
a
white
man
was
at
their
mercy
not
until
a
full
hour
had
passed
could
reuben
cox
tell
his
story
and
even
then
he
was
in
such
a
sorry
plight
that
it
was
possible
for
him
to
speak
only
a
moment
at
a
time
but
before
morning
came
before
we
were
able
to
do
very
much
toward
relieving
his
sufferings
we
had
a
fairly
good
account
of
all
that
had
occurred
from
the
moment
the
five
foolish
men
clambered
over
the
stockade
until
our
cannon
had
done
its
work
of
mercy
it
seems
that
the
deserters
after
getting
outside
the
fort
decided
to
make
their
way
as
nearly
to
leger
quarters
as
might
be
possible
and
to
that
end
made
a
long
détour
to
the
westward
the
sun
had
risen
before
they
came
upon
a
sentinel
and
he
was
fortunately
as
it
seemed
to
them
one
of
the
british
regulars
their
story
was
soon
told
no
attempt
was
made
to
hide
the
fact
that
they
had
deserted
for
all
believed
that
such
a
statement
would
ensure
their
receiving
a
hearty
welcome
from
the
commander
much
to
their
surprise
however
the
british
soldiers
treated
them
with
the
utmost
contempt
and
no
slight
degree
of
harshness
the
tories
were
the
only
white
men
who
appeared
particularly
pleased
with
what
had
been
done
and
they
gave
the
fellows
a
friendly
reception
only
because
being
renegades
themselves
it
gladdened
them
to
know
there
were
others
in
the
valley
who
could
be
so
contemptible
as
a
matter
of
course
they
were
soon
taken
before
the
commander
that
he
might
question
them
but
even
he
evidently
looked
upon
them
with
no
slight
disgust
for
he
forced
them
to
remain
standing
while
in
his
presence
and
failed
to
give
any
instructions
as
to
how
they
should
be
quartered
or
fed
reuben
cox
admitted
with
many
a
groan
and
plea
for
mercy
that
he
and
his
companions
had
given
leger
all
the
information
concerning
the
fort
which
was
in
their
power
and
even
made
our
situation
appear
more
desperate
than
really
was
the
case
but
when
they
asked
for
permission
to
serve
the
king
under
his
command
he
roughly
told
them
to
present
themselves
to
sir
john
johnson
declaring
that
the
regulars
would
not
receive
them
as
just
at
that
moment
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
find
sir
john
and
more
hungry
than
they
had
ever
been
inside
fort
schuyler
they
wandered
about
until
arriving
face
to
face
with
a
party
of
indians
who
had
come
from
their
encampment
to
lounge
around
near
the
white
soldiers
from
whom
they
begged
rum
and
tobacco
that
meeting
sealed
their
fate
and
the
poor
wretches
came
to
understand
what
was
in
store
for
them
even
before
leger
had
agreed
that
they
might
be
turned
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
his
savage
allies
during
an
hour
they
did
their
best
to
escape
but
only
to
be
dragged
back
with
many
a
kick
and
blow
each
time
they
endeavored
to
sneak
out
of
the
encampment
as
nearly
as
the
unhappy
men
could
understand
there
was
a
long
angry
interview
between
sir
john
thayendanega
and
some
of
the
british
officers
before
the
matter
was
settled
and
then
they
were
delivered
up
to
the
indians
even
the
tories
shutting
their
ears
to
the
prayers
for
mercy
it
was
not
necessary
i
should
hear
what
he
had
to
say
about
the
treatment
the
deserters
received
in
the
indian
encampment
prior
to
being
led
out
to
the
stake
i
knew
full
well
what
suffering
must
have
been
theirs
before
the
hour
arrived
when
all
was
to
be
ended
i
had
had
some
slight
experience
as
a
prisoner
in
the
power
of
the
savages
and
even
then
could
not
listen
to
another
story
of
similar
treatment
without
severe
mental
pain
the
three
who
were
reserved
for
the
second
evening
entertainment
suffered
nearly
all
the
agonies
of
death
when
their
comrades
were
tortured
for
the
indians
forced
them
to
be
present
as
spectators
and
it
is
little
wonder
they
were
with
fear
when
their
turn
came
to
afford
amusement
for
those
who
found
their
greatest
delight
in
listening
to
screams
of
agony
from
helpless
victims
the
first
shot
from
the
fort
killed
two
of
the
deserters
outright
and
overturned
the
post
to
which
cox
was
being
bound
he
could
not
tell
very
much
about
the
execution
done
by
the
balls
for
at
first
he
believed
it
was
some
new
form
of
torture
which
the
savages
had
invented
but
when
the
painted
crew
fled
across
the
river
in
abject
fear
leaving
him
comparatively
at
liberty
he
began
to
understand
that
the
comrades
whom
he
had
wickedly
wronged
were
doing
what
they
could
to
aid
him
he
declared
that
there
were
no
less
than
twenty
dead
savages
lying
nearabout
the
place
when
he
started
for
the
fort
while
as
many
more
badly
wounded
were
putting
forth
every
effort
at
escaping
beyond
range
of
our
gun
all
this
was
repeated
to
me
by
sergeant
corney
who
had
heard
it
from
reuben
cox
himself
and
when
he
was
come
to
an
end
of
the
recital
i
asked
now
that
he
is
here
an
likely
to
live
what
will
be
done
with
him
that
what
i
ca
say
lad
an
i
of
the
belief
that
it
puzzles
the
commandant
not
a
little
desertion
in
the
face
of
an
enemy
is
punishable
by
death
the
world
over
an
rightly
for
a
soldier
can
commit
no
greater
crime
but
what
about
shootin
a
man
who
has
already
suffered
a
dozen
deaths
i
soon
came
to
know
that
the
question
i
had
asked
of
the
sergeant
was
being
discussed
by
all
the
garrison
many
of
the
men
declaring
that
reuben
cox
deserved
to
be
treated
as
any
other
deserter
while
a
large
number
claimed
that
the
sufferings
he
had
endured
should
be
considered
as
having
atoned
for
the
crime
the
arguments
became
so
warm
that
it
was
evident
colonel
gansevoort
would
be
forced
to
come
to
some
decision
regarding
the
matter
and
so
he
did
on
this
same
day
when
we
were
called
out
on
the
being
formed
in
a
hollow
square
then
it
was
that
the
commandant
laid
the
affair
before
us
without
comment
save
as
he
declared
that
neither
he
nor
his
staff
were
willing
to
settle
the
question
themselves
and
he
had
decided
to
leave
it
to
the
garrison
the
men
who
must
suffer
because
of
the
information
given
to
leger
if
it
so
chanced
that
the
british
commander
gained
any
advantage
through
it
discuss
it
thoroughly
among
yourselves
the
colonel
said
and
having
made
up
your
minds
as
to
what
punishment
should
be
dealt
out
to
cox
write
the
verdict
on
a
bit
of
paper
signing
your
names
thereto
and
leave
the
same
at
headquarters
whatsoever
the
majority
of
you
declare
just
to
all
concerned
shall
be
done
then
we
were
dismissed
from
parade
and
on
the
instant
there
ensued
such
a
buzzing
and
humming
that
one
might
have
thought
an
hundred
swarms
of
bees
had
taken
possession
of
the
fort
as
each
man
tried
to
impress
upon
his
neighbor
that
he
had
the
only
correct
solution
to
the
painful
question
our
minute
boys
were
all
of
the
same
mind
and
it
gave
me
no
little
satisfaction
to
know
that
my
company
were
of
the
mind
that
cox
had
been
fully
punished
for
his
without
any
delay
we
stated
our
views
in
few
words
at
the
top
of
a
sheet
of
paper
and
each
member
signed
his
name
after
which
i
carried
it
to
headquarters
it
was
colonel
gansevoort
himself
whom
i
saw
and
he
asked
after
glancing
over
the
list
of
names
how
does
it
happen
that
you
lads
arrived
at
a
decision
so
quickly
desertion
is
a
very
serious
offence
and
because
of
the
lesson
which
others
may
receive
should
be
punished
severely
true
sir
i
made
bold
to
say
but
among
those
who
signed
the
paper
are
two
who
were
prisoners
among
the
savages
and
while
not
havin
been
subjected
to
great
torture
they
have
a
fair
idea
of
what
cox
must
have
suffered
are
you
speaking
of
yourself
and
the
old
soldier
ay
sir
and
yet
because
of
what
cox
has
told
leger
you
may
soon
be
again
in
the
power
of
the
indians
that
can
never
be
sir
i
replied
gravely
we
know
full
well
you
will
not
surrender
however
sore
our
plight
therefore
the
savages
must
take
their
prisoners
in
a
fight
an
one
need
not
be
captured
alive
then
you
would
rather
die
with
a
musket
in
your
hands
than
fall
into
their
clutches
a
good
many
times
over
if
that
could
be
sir
and
so
great
was
the
horror
in
my
heart
through
simply
calling
the
possibility
to
mind
that
the
colonel
must
have
understood
i
spoke
no
more
than
the
truth
well
my
lad
i
will
tell
you
this
much
for
the
gratification
of
yourself
and
friends
when
it
comes
if
it
ever
does
that
i
am
convinced
because
of
lack
of
food
ammunition
or
any
other
contingency
that
we
can
not
hold
the
fort
i
will
lead
as
many
of
the
garrison
as
choose
to
follow
me
in
an
attempt
to
cut
our
way
through
the
enemy
lines
i
like
you
prefer
to
die
fighting
rather
than
at
the
stake
these
words
gave
me
greatest
relief
of
mind
even
though
to
do
as
the
colonel
promised
was
much
like
going
to
certain
death
and
i
asked
may
i
repeat
to
my
comrades
what
you
have
said
sir
ay
that
you
may
lad
and
unless
succor
comes
soon
i
shall
speak
quite
as
plainly
to
all
the
garrison
for
morning
the
rations
are
of
a
necessity
to
be
cut
down
which
will
give
our
discontented
men
good
chance
to
talk
of
starvation
it
would
have
given
me
greatest
satisfaction
to
ask
him
a
few
questions
concerning
our
supplies
which
when
he
made
the
statement
to
the
garrison
had
seemed
so
plentiful
but
fortunately
i
had
sense
enough
to
understand
that
for
a
lad
like
me
to
make
searching
inquiries
of
the
commandant
of
a
fort
was
something
which
the
most
officer
would
not
tolerate
for
an
instant
therefore
thanking
him
for
having
given
me
the
assurance
which
he
had
i
took
my
leave
going
with
all
speed
to
the
barracks
that
i
might
acquaint
sergeant
corney
with
what
i
had
heard
it
good
news
lad
though
not
much
different
from
what
i
come
to
expect
from
sich
a
soldier
as
the
commandant
now
we
nothin
in
particular
to
worry
about
seem
there
wo
be
any
question
of
advantage
of
the
britisher
offer
which
would
be
kept
in
the
case
of
all
hands
much
as
it
was
when
our
poor
fools
deserted
but
what
is
this
about
short
allowance
i
thought
it
was
proven
to
us
that
we
had
supplies
in
plenty
for
many
days
to
come
i
can
only
tell
you
what
the
commandant
said
i
reckon
he
explain
matters
when
he
tells
us
why
the
rations
are
short
an
that
he
have
to
do
in
order
to
satisfy
some
of
the
imitation
soldiers
we
got
in
this
fort
then
the
old
man
went
to
his
post
of
duty
and
i
rejoined
the
minute
boys
over
the
where
every
member
of
my
company
was
aching
to
get
a
fair
shot
at
one
of
thayendanega
curs
the
indians
were
not
inclined
to
show
themselves
on
this
morning
after
we
gave
our
i
fancy
they
had
come
to
understand
it
be
an
easy
matter
to
get
the
best
of
us
and
were
having
considerably
more
of
fighting
than
was
pleasing
never
one
of
the
painted
snakes
came
within
range
of
our
rifles
at
some
time
during
the
night
they
had
plucked
up
courage
enough
to
drag
off
their
wounded
and
if
they
visited
the
british
or
tory
camp
that
day
it
was
after
making
such
a
détour
through
the
thicket
as
kept
them
screened
from
our
view
in
the
trenches
the
white
portion
of
leger
army
worked
like
men
who
feel
the
whip
behind
them
and
our
people
succeeded
in
sending
six
to
the
hospital
or
their
last
without
receiving
a
scratch
such
a
siege
as
had
been
carried
on
during
the
past
eight
and
forty
hours
could
not
be
cheerful
amusement
and
i
began
to
have
an
idea
that
it
would
not
take
very
much
of
a
reverse
to
send
the
tories
flying
to
some
other
section
of
the
country
if
our
people
would
only
follow
the
example
set
them
by
colonel
gansevoort
it
seemed
certain
we
could
hold
the
fort
at
no
greater
cost
than
that
of
being
hungry
during
a
certain
length
of
time
when
another
day
had
come
and
the
rations
were
reduced
in
size
as
the
commandant
had
said
they
would
be
there
was
a
hum
of
dissatisfaction
all
over
the
fort
even
those
whom
we
counted
as
being
the
doing
their
full
share
of
grumbling
and
wholly
because
the
commandant
had
so
lately
told
them
that
we
had
sufficient
of
food
for
many
days
they
were
not
yet
done
with
the
business
of
deciding
what
punishment
should
be
dealt
out
to
cox
but
that
was
entirely
lost
sight
of
in
face
of
this
apparent
change
in
the
situation
it
seemed
as
if
the
store
of
provisions
must
be
very
low
indeed
else
the
rations
would
not
have
been
cut
down
so
soon
after
the
statements
made
by
the
quartermaster
it
is
true
that
there
was
no
mutinous
talk
to
be
heard
the
fate
of
the
deserters
had
taught
the
grumblers
a
lesson
that
would
not
soon
be
forgotten
but
much
was
said
that
did
not
tend
to
improve
the
discipline
at
noon
word
was
passed
among
the
men
that
the
last
of
the
votes
on
case
must
be
in
the
commandant
hands
within
two
hours
and
it
was
generally
understood
if
not
stated
as
a
fact
that
at
nightfall
we
would
hear
the
verdict
then
also
so
nearly
all
the
members
of
the
garrison
believed
colonel
gansevoort
would
explain
the
reason
for
putting
us
on
short
allowance
after
having
stated
that
we
had
food
in
plenty
therefore
it
was
the
men
went
about
their
work
as
usual
content
to
wait
until
night
but
the
commandant
would
have
been
unwise
to
keep
them
in
ignorance
longer
the
only
mistake
that
has
been
made
in
this
business
was
when
colonel
gansevoort
condescended
to
give
out
any
statement
while
the
men
were
ripe
for
mutiny
sergeant
corney
stopped
to
say
to
me
as
i
met
him
on
the
while
going
to
the
barracks
to
summon
some
of
the
lads
whose
time
for
had
come
if
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
had
been
put
under
arrest
an
such
as
the
deserters
strung
up
by
the
thumbs
four
lives
might
have
been
saved
an
there
would
be
any
foolish
talk
made
now
i
had
no
time
to
reply
to
the
old
man
for
having
thus
relieved
his
mind
he
passed
on
and
i
went
about
my
duties
the
britishers
and
tories
worked
in
the
trenches
the
savages
kept
well
out
of
sight
and
we
of
the
garrison
watched
eagerly
for
an
opportunity
to
send
home
a
bullet
where
it
would
do
the
most
good
until
nightfall
and
then
came
the
call
for
us
to
fall
into
line
the
fate
of
cox
had
been
decided
and
we
were
to
be
told
about
the
reduction
of
rations
therefore
nearly
every
man
wore
an
expression
of
anxious
expectation
sergeant
corney
was
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
he
apparently
had
no
particular
interest
in
either
matter
and
obeyed
the
call
as
if
he
did
so
only
because
it
was
necessary
as
on
the
previous
occasion
we
were
drawn
up
in
a
hollow
square
with
colonel
gansevoort
and
his
staff
inside
and
without
wasting
many
words
in
leading
up
to
the
subject
the
commandant
announced
that
the
majority
of
the
men
had
decided
there
was
no
need
of
further
punishment
for
reuben
cox
that
the
penalty
which
he
had
already
paid
was
a
sufficient
lesson
for
those
of
us
who
entertained
any
idea
of
trusting
to
the
promises
made
by
the
british
commander
then
he
spoke
of
our
being
put
on
short
allowance
and
straightway
the
men
pricked
up
their
ears
listening
intently
to
the
end
that
they
might
be
able
to
prove
the
quartermaster
had
told
a
deliberate
falsehood
you
were
told
that
we
had
food
sufficient
with
which
to
feed
all
inside
the
walls
for
a
term
of
three
weeks
he
said
speaking
slowly
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
as
to
his
words
the
statement
under
the
conditions
then
existing
was
true
but
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
since
that
time
general
leger
has
been
informed
of
our
situation
so
far
as
the
deserters
understood
it
the
result
of
his
learning
that
the
stock
of
provisions
is
not
as
great
as
it
should
be
has
been
the
increased
activity
of
the
foe
which
entails
much
severe
labor
upon
you
and
causes
him
to
guard
more
closely
against
the
succor
which
may
be
sent
us
therefore
my
officers
and
i
have
believed
it
wisest
to
say
to
ourselves
that
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
aid
from
the
outside
can
come
to
us
for
four
or
five
weeks
even
if
colonel
willett
and
lieutenant
stockwell
finally
succeed
in
finding
general
schuyler
because
it
must
arrive
in
sufficient
force
to
break
through
the
lines
leger
will
throw
around
us
now
in
order
that
we
may
safely
count
on
having
sufficient
food
to
sustain
life
during
at
least
five
weeks
it
has
been
decided
after
due
deliberation
to
put
the
entire
garrison
the
commandant
as
well
as
the
men
on
short
allowance
and
what
if
general
schuyler
has
so
much
on
his
hands
because
of
burgoyne
that
he
ca
come
to
our
relief
if
when
we
are
come
to
our
last
two
rations
we
get
no
definite
information
that
relief
is
near
at
hand
we
will
sally
out
at
night
and
cut
our
way
through
the
enemy
lines
colonel
gansevoort
cried
in
ringing
tones
and
straightway
sergeant
corney
set
about
clapping
his
hands
with
such
vigor
that
almost
before
the
men
were
aware
of
the
fact
they
were
applauding
the
commandant
heartily
in
the
midst
of
this
involuntary
token
of
the
officers
very
wisely
went
to
their
quarters
leaving
us
to
stew
over
the
situation
in
such
fashion
as
best
pleased
us
every
man
on
the
understood
full
well
that
if
he
would
save
his
life
it
stood
him
in
hand
to
get
back
to
his
post
of
duty
without
unnecessary
delay
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
those
whose
turn
it
was
to
go
on
duty
were
setting
about
the
regular
routine
as
laid
down
since
the
besiegers
displayed
unusual
activity
that
night
when
sergeant
corney
should
have
been
sleeping
he
came
to
my
post
and
the
two
of
us
discussed
the
situation
in
all
its
bearings
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
garrison
was
in
much
better
shape
than
it
would
have
been
but
for
the
horrible
lesson
thayendanega
villains
gave
us
regarding
their
treatment
of
prisoners
certain
it
was
that
we
would
hear
no
more
about
surrendering
therefore
we
need
not
fear
another
mutiny
and
as
the
old
man
said
grimly
if
the
men
want
more
to
eat
let
go
outside
to
get
it
for
it
do
any
good
to
whine
after
what
has
been
said
during
the
week
which
followed
every
man
did
his
full
duty
and
we
heard
very
little
grumbling
although
i
am
sorry
to
set
it
down
that
some
of
the
did
wag
their
tongues
more
than
was
seemly
but
on
the
whole
the
garrison
showed
themselves
to
be
fairly
good
soldiers
reuben
cox
was
able
to
move
about
on
the
fourth
day
after
he
succeeded
in
getting
inside
the
fort
and
as
i
saw
this
man
and
that
who
had
formerly
been
his
close
comrades
move
aside
lest
he
should
speak
to
them
i
decided
that
the
man
punishment
was
far
greater
than
any
we
could
have
inflicted
upon
him
death
according
to
my
way
of
thinking
would
have
been
far
preferable
to
being
thus
scorned
cox
must
have
had
some
such
thoughts
himself
for
coming
full
upon
the
commandant
one
day
the
two
being
not
above
twenty
paces
from
where
i
was
stationed
he
pleaded
piteously
to
leave
the
fort
in
order
that
he
might
do
what
he
could
toward
hurrying
forward
the
relief
for
which
we
were
hoping
you
would
not
live
to
get
two
hundred
yards
away
colonel
gansevoort
replied
speaking
not
unkindly
the
enemy
are
doubtless
on
the
alert
for
some
such
attempt
on
our
part
since
knowing
we
are
not
overly
burdened
with
food
i
would
like
to
make
the
try
sir
cox
said
in
a
pleading
tone
an
if
it
so
be
that
they
get
hold
of
me
again
it
be
better
to
die
in
their
hands
than
stay
here
where
every
man
looks
upon
me
as
somethin
to
be
despised
you
ca
be
surprised
cox
that
the
brave
fellows
whose
plight
has
been
rendered
more
desperate
by
what
you
and
your
companions
did
should
be
averse
to
making
friendly
with
you
i
not
surprised
sir
an
i
like
to
end
it
all
by
showin
that
still
got
man
enough
in
me
to
die
tryin
to
repair
the
mischief
been
done
the
only
way
to
make
atonement
is
by
doing
whatsoever
comes
to
your
hand
here
in
the
fort
there
like
to
be
plenty
of
fighting
ahead
of
us
and
you
should
be
able
to
do
more
than
your
share
could
it
be
fixed
sir
so
that
i
might
give
up
nearly
all
my
rations
to
those
who
need
the
most
the
poor
fellow
asked
in
a
tone
so
pitiful
and
weak
that
my
heart
really
went
out
in
sympathy
to
him
we
will
stand
or
fall
on
the
same
footing
my
man
the
colonel
said
as
he
walked
away
and
immediately
i
was
relieved
of
duty
i
made
it
my
business
to
repeat
the
conversation
to
every
man
i
came
across
we
were
all
so
near
death
just
then
that
it
surely
seemed
as
if
we
should
have
forgiveness
in
our
hearts
for
such
as
cox
lest
we
be
denied
that
same
boon
in
the
next
world
from
that
day
our
people
showed
less
aversion
for
the
repentant
deserter
and
of
a
verity
he
did
the
work
of
three
men
during
every
four
and
twenty
hours
thereafter
while
we
remained
in
fort
schuyler
in
just
eight
days
after
that
assault
when
the
indians
so
nearly
succeeded
in
gaining
a
foothold
in
the
another
attack
was
threatened
and
this
time
it
was
not
unexpected
we
had
been
punishing
so
severely
those
who
were
working
in
the
trenches
and
had
kept
the
savages
such
close
prisoners
in
their
own
encampment
that
it
seemed
only
natural
the
more
soldierly
of
the
men
in
army
should
insist
on
being
led
against
us
it
was
possible
for
us
to
tell
by
the
shouts
and
yells
that
on
a
certain
night
thayendanega
cowards
had
assembled
in
the
british
camp
for
a
powwow
although
they
had
taken
good
care
not
to
let
us
see
them
going
there
and
sergeant
corney
said
to
me
as
if
he
had
a
written
programme
of
the
entire
proceedings
we
will
have
redcoats
in
plenty
at
which
to
shoot
why
do
you
say
that
i
asked
in
surprise
i
eat
my
head
if
barry
leger
has
called
thayendanega
gang
together
with
the
idea
of
stiffenin
their
backs
so
they
be
willin
to
make
an
assault
the
regulars
have
been
gettin
mighty
uneasy
these
two
days
an
somethin
has
got
to
be
done
different
from
to
keep
in
good
spirits
wo
cox
fight
if
he
gets
another
show
at
the
beauties
who
came
so
near
killing
him
at
the
stake
i
cried
giving
words
to
the
first
thought
which
entered
my
mind
he
wo
get
the
chance
the
assault
will
be
made
before
night
an
never
a
feather
can
be
seen
why
are
you
so
positive
about
that
they
much
the
same
as
told
us
if
we
had
got
cowed
by
sendin
a
bullet
their
way
whenever
one
of
the
sneaks
showed
his
nose
they
been
cavortin
here
this
week
past
tryin
to
make
it
lively
for
us
i
tell
you
noel
we
can
count
the
painted
murderers
out
of
the
game
from
this
on
i
hope
you
may
be
right
i
said
with
a
sigh
for
if
leger
has
lost
as
many
of
his
army
as
thayendanega
crowd
represents
it
wo
be
such
a
desperate
venture
to
cut
our
way
through
his
lines
when
we
eaten
the
last
ration
do
stop
believin
that
general
schuyler
will
contrive
to
give
us
a
lift
i
countin
that
he
lookin
after
the
matter
now
the
sergeant
replied
and
then
he
walked
away
whistling
softly
as
if
the
thought
of
taking
part
against
another
assault
pleased
him
mightily
before
morning
came
i
understood
that
sergeant
corney
was
not
the
only
one
in
the
garrison
who
believed
the
enemy
would
soon
show
unusual
signs
of
life
the
howling
and
yelling
of
the
savages
at
the
powwow
continued
until
near
to
midnight
and
the
noise
had
hardly
more
than
died
away
when
the
commandant
came
to
where
i
was
stationed
halting
a
moment
to
gaze
in
the
direction
of
the
indian
camp
before
he
asked
have
you
seen
any
targets
in
this
direction
lately
it
has
been
a
good
many
days
since
any
of
the
crew
gave
us
a
chance
to
show
what
we
could
do
with
a
bullet
sir
how
long
are
you
on
duty
until
morning
sir
jacob
sitz
and
i
have
thought
best
to
stay
with
the
sentinels
of
our
company
during
all
the
hours
of
darkness
we
catch
a
now
and
then
so
it
is
like
doin
extra
work
your
lads
will
make
good
names
for
themselves
among
those
who
love
the
cause
if
they
keep
on
as
they
begun
the
colonel
said
in
the
most
kindly
tone
and
the
praise
made
me
as
proud
as
any
peacock
for
i
had
hoped
we
might
be
able
to
show
him
we
could
do
the
work
of
men
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
get
my
wits
together
quickly
enough
to
thank
him
as
i
should
have
done
and
immediately
he
said
as
if
speaking
to
one
of
his
officers
see
that
a
sharp
watch
be
kept
from
now
on
and
do
not
hesitate
to
raise
an
alarm
if
anything
unusual
is
seen
captain
campbell
i
am
certain
my
cheeks
reddened
when
he
thus
recognized
my
rank
yet
i
was
such
a
simple
that
i
could
only
stammer
you
must
have
in
mind
sir
somethin
the
same
as
has
sergeant
corney
he
has
lately
been
here
predicting
an
assault
for
the
sergeant
uses
his
ears
to
some
purpose
the
colonel
said
with
a
laugh
and
then
he
walked
away
leaving
me
with
a
determination
to
keep
guard
as
i
had
never
kept
it
before
chapter
xvii
perplexing
scenes
surely
if
ever
a
boy
had
been
warned
of
coming
danger
i
was
that
one
and
the
great
fear
in
my
mind
was
lest
at
the
critical
moment
i
fail
to
do
my
duty
it
seemed
as
if
the
commandant
had
much
the
same
as
told
me
he
was
depending
upon
the
minute
boys
to
bring
him
word
of
the
first
sign
or
sound
of
danger
and
i
was
nervously
afraid
lest
by
some
unlucky
chance
i
might
disappoint
him
after
having
dwelt
upon
the
matter
for
half
an
hour
or
more
giving
undue
prominence
to
my
own
responsibility
i
aroused
jacob
who
was
sleeping
in
an
angle
of
the
wall
hard
by
and
repeated
to
him
the
substance
of
the
conversations
with
colonel
gansevoort
and
sergeant
corney
well
i
do
know
why
we
should
be
in
a
better
position
than
any
other
to
know
what
may
be
goin
on
he
said
rubbing
his
eyes
sleepily
if
the
sergeant
has
the
rights
of
it
an
the
savages
are
done
with
the
siege
then
we
not
likely
to
see
much
from
this
point
but
we
not
certain
the
old
man
knows
better
than
any
one
else
he
has
figured
it
out
to
suit
himself
without
havin
definite
knowledge
the
commandant
has
much
the
same
as
praised
our
company
an
we
must
see
to
it
that
he
has
no
cause
to
blame
by
this
time
jacob
was
fully
awake
and
he
set
out
along
such
portion
of
the
wall
as
was
under
our
charge
straining
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
indian
encampment
but
without
seeing
anything
whatsoever
not
a
was
burning
and
i
failed
to
hear
even
the
howling
of
a
dog
which
was
something
so
unusual
as
to
cause
us
no
little
surprise
can
it
be
that
thayendanega
gang
has
deserted
general
st
leger
i
asked
in
a
whisper
the
sergeant
will
have
it
that
they
are
done
with
the
siege
in
which
case
it
would
be
surprisin
if
they
had
sneaked
away
there
no
such
good
news
as
that
jacob
said
with
a
laugh
but
puzzled
to
make
out
why
they
so
quiet
had
we
been
left
to
our
own
counsels
ten
minutes
longer
i
believe
i
might
have
been
tempted
to
waken
the
sergeant
which
would
have
given
him
an
opportunity
to
laugh
at
us
because
we
had
grown
nervous
over
the
absence
of
all
but
just
then
peter
sitz
approached
and
i
whispered
to
my
comrade
in
a
tone
of
relief
that
he
and
i
were
not
the
only
nervous
members
of
the
garrison
it
seems
as
if
all
hands
had
it
in
mind
that
we
need
lookin
after
jacob
replied
grimly
and
then
his
father
asked
if
we
had
seen
anything
unusual
since
the
powwow
came
to
an
end
it
what
we
neither
seen
nor
heard
that
puzzlin
us
sir
my
comrade
said
and
then
he
called
his
father
attention
to
the
remarkable
quiet
which
reigned
where
ordinarily
noises
of
some
kind
could
be
heard
during
every
hour
of
the
night
master
sitz
appeared
decidedly
disturbed
in
mind
yet
he
made
no
comment
and
after
listening
in
vain
five
minutes
or
more
he
walked
away
without
giving
heed
to
us
it
really
appeared
before
that
long
night
had
come
to
an
end
as
if
every
officer
in
the
fort
suspected
something
might
be
wrong
and
what
seemed
yet
more
strange
to
me
they
all
came
directly
to
our
post
instead
of
visiting
those
sentinels
who
if
the
savages
had
really
cut
loose
from
leger
should
have
been
in
the
best
positions
to
hear
or
see
the
first
signs
of
the
expected
assault
i
have
set
all
this
down
at
considerable
length
because
in
view
of
what
finally
occurred
it
was
much
as
if
our
people
had
a
premonition
of
that
which
was
to
come
the
night
passed
without
alarm
and
i
am
willing
to
take
my
oath
that
if
any
animal
as
large
as
a
dog
had
passed
within
an
hundred
yards
of
the
we
would
have
seen
it
the
entire
garrison
even
including
women
and
children
was
astir
when
the
first
gray
light
of
coming
day
appeared
in
the
eastern
sky
and
as
each
man
came
out
upon
the
i
noted
the
fact
that
he
had
all
his
weapons
with
him
of
course
these
details
are
of
no
particular
importance
and
yet
i
have
set
them
down
in
order
to
show
how
strong
was
the
belief
of
every
person
in
the
fort
that
something
unusual
was
about
to
happen
although
with
the
exception
of
the
powwow
held
in
leger
camp
the
evening
previous
we
had
seen
nothing
to
betoken
especial
activity
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
it
was
early
in
the
morning
the
men
had
not
yet
broken
their
fast
when
one
of
the
sentinels
shouted
here
they
come
here
they
come
i
expected
to
see
every
man
spring
toward
the
walls
in
order
to
learn
for
himself
what
had
caused
the
alarm
and
at
any
other
time
they
would
have
done
so
but
so
great
was
the
sense
of
impending
danger
that
instinctively
the
garrison
formed
in
line
ready
for
orders
i
had
not
yet
been
relieved
from
duty
and
therefore
remained
where
it
was
possible
to
have
a
fairly
good
view
of
all
the
encampments
occupied
by
the
enemy
near
the
quarters
of
the
british
regulars
i
could
see
the
men
drawn
up
in
line
as
if
making
ready
to
advance
and
in
the
tory
camp
there
was
a
bustle
and
confusion
such
as
might
have
been
made
by
soldiers
while
trying
to
copy
after
those
who
knew
their
business
but
the
indians
gave
no
signs
of
life
save
as
their
squaws
went
about
the
ordinary
camp
work
because
everything
had
been
so
suspiciously
quiet
in
this
last
quarter
during
the
night
i
more
than
half
expected
to
discover
that
they
had
withdrawn
under
cover
of
darkness
but
the
presence
of
the
women
and
children
told
i
was
mistaken
unless
the
entire
gang
had
spent
the
night
with
the
white
men
however
it
was
positive
these
exceedingly
brave
warriors
of
whom
thayendanega
boasted
had
no
idea
of
continuing
the
part
of
allies
during
this
day
at
least
a
plentiful
supply
of
ammunition
was
dealt
out
to
our
men
and
the
big
guns
were
served
as
if
our
magazine
was
filled
to
overflowing
after
which
the
garrison
went
to
quarters
reuben
cox
being
the
happiest
member
of
the
army
for
he
believed
the
time
was
near
at
hand
when
it
might
be
possible
for
him
to
wipe
out
some
of
the
stain
which
rested
upon
him
the
minute
boys
were
ordered
to
remain
at
their
post
over
the
much
to
my
disappointment
for
if
the
indians
did
not
take
part
in
the
assault
which
we
had
every
reason
to
believe
was
near
at
hand
then
would
our
duties
be
so
light
that
we
could
not
hope
to
win
much
credit
do
not
let
it
be
supposed
that
i
had
become
a
of
a
soldier
the
cold
chill
of
fear
still
crept
up
and
down
my
spine
whenever
i
thought
of
taking
part
in
an
engagement
but
i
was
becoming
so
nearly
a
man
as
to
desire
in
case
it
became
necessary
to
fight
that
i
might
gain
some
honor
for
standing
stiffly
when
really
my
heart
was
faint
we
remained
at
quarters
a
full
expecting
each
instant
to
see
the
long
lines
of
soldiers
emerge
from
amid
the
fringe
of
foliage
which
partially
screened
their
encampment
and
yet
the
advance
was
delayed
what
the
matter
jacob
asked
nervously
as
he
pressed
close
to
my
side
i
wish
i
knew
lad
was
my
reply
in
a
voice
that
was
not
overly
steady
this
waitin
while
others
are
gettin
ready
to
try
to
kill
a
fellow
is
not
to
my
likin
i
had
rather
have
a
full
hour
of
hot
fightin
than
such
idleness
when
we
know
that
soon
the
bullets
will
be
whistlin
around
our
ears
jacob
replied
and
just
then
john
sammons
came
up
as
he
said
i
reckon
they
goin
to
bring
their
with
this
time
it
looks
to
me
much
as
if
a
big
crowd
was
gatherin
in
the
rear
of
the
line
then
it
was
that
we
could
see
the
tories
running
to
and
fro
each
man
for
himself
and
in
a
twinkling
the
line
of
regulars
melted
away
there
was
no
longer
any
semblance
of
military
formation
to
be
seen
and
yet
certain
it
was
that
a
few
moments
previous
the
enemy
was
nearly
ready
for
an
assault
we
lads
were
not
the
only
ones
who
felt
disturbed
because
of
this
strange
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
i
could
see
that
colonel
gansevoort
and
all
his
officers
were
on
that
portion
of
the
wall
nearest
the
british
camp
gazing
earnestly
toward
it
while
our
men
moved
about
uneasily
as
if
having
forgotten
that
they
had
been
sent
to
their
several
posts
of
duty
strain
our
eyes
as
we
might
it
was
impossible
to
make
so
much
as
a
guess
regarding
what
could
be
the
cause
of
the
odd
proceedings
and
it
was
in
my
mind
to
go
in
search
of
sergeant
corney
to
ask
his
opinion
of
the
situation
when
john
sammons
cried
suddenly
look
there
the
sneaks
are
comin
out
at
last
i
reckon
the
britishers
have
been
waitin
for
but
one
glance
was
sufficient
to
show
me
that
john
had
spoken
truly
from
the
lodges
i
could
see
troops
of
savages
pouring
forth
with
every
token
of
excitement
like
a
swarm
of
hornets
and
that
something
unusual
was
afoot
might
be
told
by
the
fact
that
no
effort
was
made
to
keep
beyond
range
of
our
guns
as
the
befeathered
and
painted
horde
went
swiftly
toward
leger
quarters
i
was
determined
that
my
company
should
remain
at
its
post
no
matter
what
might
happen
until
we
got
the
word
that
it
was
no
longer
needed
there
fore
neither
jacob
nor
i
could
hear
the
speculations
of
the
men
as
to
what
had
happened
in
the
enemy
encampment
but
after
a
time
sergeant
corney
came
along
as
if
looking
for
us
and
on
seeing
the
minute
boys
standing
in
rank
while
all
the
remainder
of
the
garrison
were
flitting
here
and
there
like
flies
on
the
scent
of
molasses
he
said
grimly
here
a
sight
i
never
expected
to
see
in
this
blessed
country
where
private
soldiers
have
the
habit
of
commandin
their
superiors
why
you
lads
huntin
to
find
out
what
goin
on
we
were
ordered
here
an
to
be
ready
for
action
i
replied
not
a
little
pleased
to
hear
the
old
soldier
tone
of
approval
this
company
will
stay
where
it
is
until
i
have
permission
to
break
ranks
it
do
seem
to
be
the
military
fashion
for
americans
to
obey
a
command
so
strictly
an
i
afraid
you
settin
a
bad
example
to
them
who
demand
that
a
list
of
the
supplies
be
read
to
whenever
they
a
bit
out
of
sorts
there
a
chance
i
grow
proud
of
havin
licked
you
into
shape
if
you
do
change
your
ways
mighty
quick
i
do
fancy
you
came
here
just
to
see
why
we
stayed
on
duty
jacob
said
with
a
laugh
which
told
me
he
was
well
pleased
with
what
the
old
man
had
said
i
free
to
admit
that
i
did
expect
to
see
anythin
quite
so
soldierly
in
this
fort
an
that
the
fact
i
had
been
detailed
to
hang
headquarters
till
the
scrimmage
began
but
was
given
liberty
to
do
as
i
pleased
five
minutes
ago
consequently
i
came
here
to
find
out
why
the
fight
ai
on
we
expectin
you
to
answer
that
question
sergeant
you
never
been
backward
in
findin
fault
with
the
ways
of
american
soldiers
an
now
perhaps
you
can
tell
what
gone
wrong
with
the
britishers
i
wish
i
knew
lad
an
that
the
fact
it
looks
as
if
they
clean
forgot
we
waitin
for
an
as
for
them
precious
babies
of
thayendanega
they
gone
out
of
their
heads
completely
it
a
puzzle
all
an
i
reckon
the
commandant
is
as
much
in
the
dark
as
are
the
rest
of
us
ca
you
make
a
guess
jacob
asked
impatiently
not
a
bit
of
it
lad
but
it
certain
there
trouble
of
some
kind
at
barry
leger
quarters
an
i
of
the
mind
to
find
out
if
you
jacob
want
to
stir
yourselves
a
bit
how
do
you
count
on
doin
it
i
asked
in
surprise
to
believe
the
old
man
was
joking
look
at
the
indian
encampment
do
you
think
there
anybody
nearabout
that
place
who
keepin
an
eye
on
this
fort
even
the
squaws
have
gone
over
to
the
british
quarters
they
been
paddlin
across
the
river
for
the
last
jacob
replied
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
failed
to
see
a
living
being
outside
the
lodges
search
with
my
eyes
as
i
might
an
it
much
the
same
over
yonder
sergeant
corney
said
as
he
pointed
to
the
other
encampments
every
blessed
one
of
us
might
sneak
out
an
not
attract
any
attention
from
them
as
are
supposed
to
be
besiegin
us
well
i
asked
as
the
old
man
paused
well
if
you
an
jacob
feel
like
havin
a
look
around
i
ask
the
commandant
permission
to
do
a
little
scoutin
on
our
own
account
agreein
in
case
we
laid
by
the
heels
not
to
expect
any
help
from
this
garrison
do
you
mean
to
go
outside
the
fort
john
sammons
asked
his
eyes
opening
wide
in
surprise
you
guessed
it
the
first
time
sergeant
corney
replied
with
a
laugh
and
i
said
in
a
tone
of
conviction
the
commandant
never
will
give
you
permission
i
heard
him
refuse
reuben
cox
most
emphatically
but
that
was
when
everythin
seemed
to
be
runnin
smooth
an
cox
only
wanted
to
get
himself
killed
now
i
go
bail
that
colonel
gansevoort
is
more
eager
than
we
to
know
the
meanin
of
this
queer
business
an
will
jump
at
the
plan
you
know
better
after
you
asked
him
i
suggested
if
he
gives
permission
jacob
an
i
are
with
you
the
old
man
sauntered
away
as
if
he
had
nothing
of
importance
to
do
and
with
a
look
on
his
face
which
told
that
he
was
certain
of
getting
the
desired
permission
without
very
much
difficulty
the
thought
was
in
my
mind
that
he
would
receive
a
very
decided
answer
from
the
commandant
without
delay
and
after
a
fashion
that
would
not
be
pleasing
to
him
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
no
sane
officer
could
sanction
an
attempt
to
send
out
scouts
across
the
open
plain
in
the
clear
light
of
day
therefore
one
can
imagine
somewhat
of
my
surprise
when
word
came
for
jacob
and
me
to
report
at
headquarters
without
delay
can
it
be
possible
that
colonel
gansevoort
is
seriously
thinkin
of
allowin
the
sergeant
to
leave
the
fort
in
the
daytime
i
asked
of
my
comrade
as
we
went
rapidly
across
the
to
obey
the
summons
it
looks
like
it
for
a
fact
else
why
should
we
have
been
sent
for
beginnin
to
think
noel
that
you
said
to
his
wild
scheme
too
quickly
there
wo
be
any
child
play
in
tryin
to
get
from
the
fort
to
where
we
can
find
the
first
show
of
cover
meanin
that
you
not
willin
to
make
the
venture
i
asked
quickly
hoping
my
comrade
would
flatly
refuse
to
go
for
now
that
the
venture
seemed
countenanced
by
colonel
gansevoort
i
was
growing
mighty
i
would
stick
my
nose
into
a
good
deal
of
danger
before
bein
willin
to
go
back
on
a
promise
made
to
the
sergeant
jacob
replied
thoughtfully
if
he
has
told
the
commandant
that
we
are
minded
to
go
there
for
it
but
to
tackle
the
job
i
was
decidedly
disappointed
by
the
reply
and
yet
could
make
no
protest
since
i
was
the
one
who
had
spoken
for
us
both
when
the
old
man
broached
the
subject
and
in
silence
we
walked
on
until
having
come
to
the
door
of
the
colonel
quarters
the
sentinel
on
duty
there
had
evidently
received
orders
concerning
us
for
he
announced
that
we
were
to
go
in
at
once
and
i
pushed
jacob
ahead
as
we
entered
the
apartment
where
sergeant
corney
was
standing
in
a
soldierly
attitude
in
front
of
the
commandant
we
were
not
called
on
to
wait
many
seconds
before
learning
the
reason
for
the
summons
since
colonel
gansevoort
jumped
into
the
subject
by
saying
so
you
lads
are
keen
for
a
hazardous
venture
eh
i
would
have
given
much
if
at
that
moment
i
could
have
called
up
sufficient
courage
to
say
that
i
was
well
content
to
remain
within
the
walls
of
the
fort
but
instead
of
boldly
declaring
myself
i
remained
silent
until
jacob
said
with
only
a
faint
show
of
enthusiasm
we
told
sergeant
corney
that
we
would
go
with
him
to
find
out
what
may
be
the
trouble
in
general
leger
camp
if
so
be
you
gave
permission
sir
now
was
i
fully
committed
to
a
matter
which
was
by
no
means
to
my
liking
and
with
a
certain
sense
of
being
i
listened
to
that
which
followed
under
almost
any
other
circumstances
i
would
flatly
refuse
permission
for
any
man
to
leave
the
fort
but
now
it
seems
as
if
it
was
of
the
highest
importance
we
should
know
what
is
taking
place
in
the
enemy
camp
whatever
it
may
be
is
of
such
a
serious
nature
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
entire
encampment
so
entirely
that
no
attention
whatsoever
appears
to
be
paid
to
us
i
believe
that
by
leaving
through
the
you
can
make
your
way
to
the
rear
of
the
british
encampment
without
incurring
any
very
grave
danger
and
if
it
is
the
desire
of
you
lads
to
go
with
the
sergeant
you
have
my
permission
it
was
just
what
i
did
want
but
under
the
circumstances
i
could
do
no
less
than
look
as
if
he
had
granted
us
the
greatest
favor
possible
and
at
the
same
moment
it
would
have
done
me
solid
good
had
i
been
able
to
kick
the
sergeant
with
sufficient
vigor
to
convince
him
that
he
had
made
an
ass
of
himself
then
the
colonel
after
receiving
our
thanks
for
permission
to
run
our
heads
into
unnecessary
danger
went
on
to
explain
what
he
would
have
us
do
in
case
we
lived
long
enough
to
get
an
idea
of
that
which
was
going
on
in
the
enemy
camp
as
he
had
already
said
we
were
to
scale
the
stockade
in
the
and
then
making
a
détour
to
the
westward
gain
the
cover
of
such
shelter
as
might
be
found
on
the
high
lands
working
well
toward
the
ruins
of
fort
newport
before
trying
to
strike
across
to
and
behind
the
line
of
earthworks
which
leger
had
caused
to
be
thrown
up
early
in
the
siege
he
had
laid
out
a
long
journey
for
us
and
one
that
might
not
be
performed
before
nightfall
but
it
had
the
merit
of
being
comparatively
safe
until
we
were
in
the
vicinity
of
the
british
encampment
the
interview
was
brought
to
a
close
within
five
minutes
after
it
had
begun
and
then
we
were
at
liberty
to
make
our
preparations
for
that
which
might
result
in
our
death
by
torture
for
it
was
certain
that
if
the
indians
laid
hands
on
another
man
from
the
fort
they
would
take
good
care
he
was
neither
rescued
nor
killed
until
they
had
worked
their
cruel
will
upon
him
sergeant
corney
was
inclined
to
boast
of
having
succeeded
when
i
had
declared
he
must
fail
and
would
have
congratulated
himself
in
great
shape
while
we
were
crossing
the
on
our
way
to
the
barracks
but
that
i
said
curtly
that
man
who
exerts
himself
to
go
into
danger
will
one
day
find
himself
in
a
box
from
which
his
best
friends
ca
extricate
him
which
is
the
same
as
sayin
that
you
changed
your
mind
about
goin
out
scoutin
he
cried
sharply
looking
me
squarely
in
the
face
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
go
if
the
job
is
to
your
likin
both
jacob
an
i
must
keep
on
with
you
or
write
ourselves
down
as
cowards
but
at
the
same
time
we
have
the
right
to
think
it
a
foolish
venture
the
words
had
no
sooner
escaped
my
lips
than
i
regretted
having
spoken
and
without
delay
i
hastened
to
make
amends
by
explaining
that
i
was
in
truth
frightened
at
the
idea
of
venturing
into
that
nest
of
snakes
from
which
we
had
once
barely
gotten
away
with
our
lives
the
old
man
must
have
understood
that
i
spoke
rather
from
nervousness
than
because
i
was
really
in
anger
and
immediately
he
acted
as
if
nothing
unpleasant
had
been
said
but
began
to
discuss
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
wise
to
burden
ourselves
with
weapons
when
if
brought
to
bay
we
could
not
hope
to
fight
our
way
through
before
we
had
more
than
gained
the
barracks
half
the
men
in
the
fortification
had
some
knowledge
of
our
intentions
and
we
were
overwhelmed
alike
with
questions
and
suggestions
but
very
few
minutes
were
needed
in
which
to
make
ready
for
the
venture
and
when
we
came
out
of
the
barracks
all
three
of
us
had
rifles
strapped
upon
our
backs
in
such
a
manner
that
they
would
not
interfere
with
our
movements
in
case
it
became
necessary
to
trust
to
the
fleetness
of
our
feet
three
rounds
of
ammunition
for
each
one
sufficient
corn
bread
to
make
a
single
meal
and
completed
the
outfit
it
would
have
pleased
us
better
had
we
been
allowed
to
depart
unaided
but
a
full
half
of
the
garrison
appeared
to
think
it
absolutely
necessary
to
go
with
us
to
the
very
limits
of
the
fort
and
if
good
wishes
are
of
any
avail
at
such
a
time
then
were
we
certain
of
returning
in
good
condition
once
on
the
plain
outside
the
stockaded
portion
of
the
works
sergeant
corney
led
the
way
by
going
in
a
southerly
direction
for
a
distance
of
an
hundred
yards
or
more
and
then
striking
sharply
off
toward
the
west
where
was
to
be
found
the
nearest
cover
having
gained
the
line
of
foliage
which
fringed
the
high
tract
of
land
it
was
possible
to
march
off
at
a
smart
pace
without
need
of
taking
particular
heed
to
our
steps
and
we
travelled
rapidly
until
having
arrived
at
a
point
midway
between
our
and
the
ruins
of
fort
newport
here
where
i
allow
we
be
wise
to
change
the
commandant
plan
a
bit
the
old
man
said
coming
to
a
halt
for
the
first
time
since
we
set
out
we
ca
gain
very
much
in
lengthenin
the
journey
by
three
or
four
miles
an
i
in
favor
of
strikin
across
to
the
hill
from
here
the
statement
was
made
in
the
form
of
a
question
and
i
replied
that
it
suited
me
to
do
as
he
thought
best
for
when
colonel
gansevoort
mapped
out
the
route
i
believed
he
was
sending
us
on
a
longer
détour
than
was
necessary
we
crossed
the
albany
road
at
that
point
where
it
bends
in
toward
the
hill
walking
at
our
best
pace
and
once
behind
the
elevation
were
screened
from
view
of
the
enemy
camp
while
we
were
going
over
the
open
country
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
british
batteries
and
the
redoubts
thrown
up
to
cover
them
but
failed
to
see
any
signs
of
human
life
that
the
enemy
had
abandoned
these
posts
even
for
a
few
moments
seemed
incredible
and
yet
it
was
all
of
the
same
piece
with
what
we
could
see
in
their
camp
sergeant
corney
led
us
directly
into
the
redoubts
which
had
made
so
much
trouble
for
us
in
the
fort
and
had
we
been
disposed
we
might
have
loaded
ourselves
down
with
plunder
of
every
description
for
the
belongings
of
the
men
were
strewn
about
as
if
cast
aside
in
great
haste
it
was
not
safe
to
remain
many
moments
where
we
were
in
fact
i
came
near
to
believing
the
sergeant
had
lost
his
wits
when
he
led
us
into
the
british
nest
and
we
hurried
out
of
the
works
going
directly
toward
leger
quarters
until
we
were
sufficiently
near
to
see
men
moving
about
excitedly
when
he
struck
off
for
the
rear
of
the
encampment
where
could
be
found
such
cover
as
stout
bushes
and
small
would
afford
we
had
advanced
boldly
on
this
last
stage
of
the
journey
emboldened
to
do
so
by
the
evidences
of
panic
or
something
near
akin
to
it
which
we
saw
on
every
hand
and
trusting
to
the
possibility
that
if
seen
it
would
be
believed
that
we
belonged
to
the
encampment
the
sun
was
yet
an
hour
high
in
the
heavens
when
we
found
a
overlooking
the
camp
and
so
easy
of
accomplishment
had
been
our
task
with
nothing
of
danger
attaching
to
it
that
i
was
heartily
ashamed
of
having
displayed
in
the
sergeant
presence
neither
of
us
spoke
when
we
were
finally
come
to
where
we
could
have
a
fairly
good
view
of
the
scene
of
confusion
the
surprise
at
what
we
saw
and
the
perplexity
because
of
it
was
so
great
that
we
could
do
no
more
or
no
less
than
stare
in
bewilderment
at
this
army
every
member
of
which
appeared
to
have
suddenly
been
deprived
of
his
reason
the
foremost
scene
which
met
our
wondering
gaze
was
a
group
composed
of
general
leger
himself
sir
john
johnson
thayendanega
and
a
dozen
or
more
leading
sachems
of
the
six
nations
these
men
were
too
far
away
to
admit
of
our
hearing
the
spirited
conversation
which
was
going
on
it
appeared
to
me
at
times
that
the
commander
was
pleading
for
some
favor
and
again
that
he
threatened
but
the
savages
seemed
to
give
little
heed
to
his
words
then
sir
john
talked
for
several
moments
apparently
appealing
to
each
of
his
companions
in
turn
whereupon
one
of
the
sachems
spoke
excitedly
using
more
gestures
than
i
ever
saw
one
of
the
scoundrels
employ
and
when
he
was
come
to
an
end
all
the
savages
save
thayendanega
stalked
off
as
if
in
a
rage
our
stupefaction
was
complete
when
general
leger
made
a
peculiar
gesture
and
straightway
two
soldiers
led
forward
a
man
whose
vacant
look
proclaimed
him
to
be
one
of
those
unfortunates
whom
god
has
deprived
of
wits
and
in
his
wake
came
three
oneida
indians
it
was
enough
to
make
a
fellow
lose
a
full
year
growth
thus
seeing
his
majesty
general
in
such
company
but
when
the
oneidas
appeared
my
surprise
gave
way
to
fear
we
had
always
counted
and
with
good
cause
on
these
indians
being
friendly
to
our
people
who
were
struggling
to
throw
off
the
yoke
which
the
king
had
put
upon
us
yet
the
fact
that
they
were
in
the
encampment
apparently
on
friendly
terms
with
our
enemies
seemed
to
betoken
still
more
trouble
and
misery
for
us
of
the
valley
jacob
gripped
my
hand
tightly
as
the
oneidas
appeared
and
i
could
see
the
corners
of
the
sergeant
mouth
twitching
as
if
he
had
suddenly
lost
that
feeling
of
security
which
had
been
so
strong
upon
him
until
this
moment
then
the
foolish
man
began
to
tell
a
long
story
to
the
general
the
indians
added
a
word
now
and
then
and
even
thayendanega
began
to
wear
a
troubled
look
it
was
all
so
strange
and
unnatural
that
i
pinched
my
own
arm
more
than
once
to
make
certain
i
was
not
in
a
dream
chapter
xviii
close
quarters
the
scenes
shifted
before
us
as
if
they
had
been
painted
on
bubbles
which
were
blown
hither
and
thither
by
the
wind
even
as
we
gazed
at
the
leaders
of
the
army
while
they
stood
listening
to
the
foolish
man
as
if
believing
him
to
be
inspired
a
mob
of
tories
and
indians
surged
toward
that
portion
of
the
encampment
and
in
an
instant
leger
thayendanega
and
sir
john
johnson
were
blotted
out
from
our
view
nothing
could
have
happened
to
give
us
who
crouched
amid
the
stunted
bushes
a
more
vivid
idea
of
the
change
which
had
come
over
the
besieging
army
than
this
one
incident
when
the
commanders
at
whose
frowns
savages
as
well
as
white
men
cringed
were
treated
with
such
utter
lack
of
ceremony
i
fully
expected
to
hear
one
or
the
other
of
these
three
burst
into
a
towering
rage
and
order
the
immediate
punishment
of
those
who
had
offended
whereas
the
men
extricated
themselves
from
the
tangle
of
soldiers
and
savages
as
best
they
could
immediately
resuming
the
apparently
confidential
conversation
with
the
idiot
i
saw
sergeant
corney
shrug
his
shoulders
as
if
to
say
that
he
had
given
over
even
trying
to
guess
what
might
have
happened
and
then
he
beckoned
for
us
to
follow
as
he
crept
straight
away
from
the
to
us
perplexing
scene
there
was
little
need
for
us
to
give
much
heed
to
our
movements
so
far
as
concerned
making
a
noise
for
i
dare
venture
to
say
that
a
full
company
of
men
might
have
marched
boldly
past
without
raising
an
alarm
so
long
as
they
remained
hidden
from
view
when
we
were
twenty
yards
or
more
from
where
the
commanders
stood
trying
to
hold
their
position
against
the
drunken
tide
of
reds
and
whites
the
sergeant
halted
and
looked
at
us
lads
inquiringly
well
i
said
irritably
vexed
because
of
my
bewilderment
if
you
explain
the
situation
there
is
no
need
to
look
at
us
it
beats
anything
i
ever
heard
of
or
dreamed
about
have
they
all
lost
their
senses
somethin
is
goin
mightily
wrong
sergeant
corney
said
impressively
as
if
he
was
imparting
valuable
information
goin
wrong
jacob
repeated
i
should
say
it
had
already
gone
wrong
with
a
vengeance
ca
you
make
some
kind
of
a
guess
sergeant
not
a
bit
of
it
lad
this
business
lays
way
over
anythin
i
ever
saw
in
all
my
experience
as
a
soldier
there
one
thing
certain
howsomever
which
is
that
jest
now
an
hundred
of
our
people
could
walk
through
the
entire
encampment
without
bein
called
upon
to
spill
a
drop
of
blood
well
i
asked
again
as
the
old
man
ceased
speaking
colonel
gansevoort
must
know
how
mixed
up
is
this
army
we
can
go
back
an
tell
him
jacob
replied
promptly
i
reckon
we
might
walk
straight
out
toward
the
fort
an
never
a
man
here
would
give
heed
to
us
if
we
knew
exactly
what
had
happened
it
might
be
as
well
for
all
three
to
go
back
to
the
fort
but
there
no
knowin
when
matters
may
take
a
turn
an
we
must
keep
a
sharp
watch
lest
through
us
our
people
are
brought
into
a
trap
why
do
you
say
what
you
mean
without
talkin
all
around
the
subject
i
cried
nervously
what
have
you
got
in
your
mind
that
one
of
us
must
go
back
to
the
fort
while
the
others
stay
here
on
watch
to
give
the
alarm
in
case
this
army
suddenly
comes
to
its
senses
it
was
not
my
desire
to
travel
back
alone
to
carry
the
tidings
there
was
no
thought
in
my
mind
that
any
danger
might
threaten
while
the
enemy
was
in
such
a
state
of
confusion
and
i
was
most
eager
to
watch
these
apparently
crazy
people
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
come
at
a
solution
of
the
riddle
therefore
i
asked
sharply
who
do
you
think
should
go
back
do
either
of
you
lads
want
to
tackle
the
job
the
sergeant
asked
and
i
understood
by
his
tone
that
he
was
as
loath
to
leave
the
place
as
was
i
neither
of
us
made
reply
and
he
went
on
as
if
already
having
had
the
plan
fixed
in
his
mind
then
we
draw
lots
to
see
who
it
shall
be
as
the
matter
stands
we
know
full
well
that
the
commandant
must
be
told
of
what
we
have
seen
it
wo
require
two
hours
travelling
because
there
no
call
to
make
a
very
wide
circuit
an
in
case
these
fellows
pull
themselves
together
before
midnight
them
as
stays
on
watch
can
warn
our
people
fix
the
drawin
of
lots
to
suit
yourself
an
he
who
gets
the
worst
of
it
will
set
out
at
once
i
said
curtly
and
the
old
man
broke
off
three
small
twigs
which
he
held
in
his
closed
hand
i
have
taken
note
of
which
is
the
shortest
but
in
case
you
might
think
i
had
make
your
choice
an
the
one
which
is
left
shall
be
mine
he
who
gets
the
shortest
goes
back
eh
jacob
asked
and
i
replied
that
is
understood
take
the
first
choice
an
let
us
settle
this
business
as
soon
as
we
can
for
i
am
wild
to
get
over
yonder
where
i
can
see
the
king
army
playin
the
fool
if
it
so
be
that
i
not
forced
to
turn
back
jacob
drew
one
of
the
twigs
without
stopping
to
make
a
selection
i
took
the
second
and
sergeant
corney
opened
his
hand
to
show
the
third
they
were
all
so
nearly
of
a
length
that
we
were
forced
to
measure
each
in
order
to
learn
who
was
the
unfortunate
and
then
it
was
found
that
jacob
had
been
selected
to
play
the
part
of
messenger
disappointed
though
the
lad
must
have
been
he
did
not
make
any
delay
but
asked
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
what
shall
i
say
to
the
commandant
tell
him
what
you
have
seen
the
sergeant
replied
an
say
that
with
two
hundred
men
at
the
most
he
can
capture
the
whole
blessed
army
if
there
should
be
any
change
within
the
next
two
hours
one
or
both
of
us
will
hurry
back
goin
around
by
way
of
the
hill
opposite
the
batteries
the
same
course
we
came
therefore
if
he
sends
out
a
detachment
let
it
approach
by
that
route
immediately
the
old
man
ceased
speaking
jacob
wheeled
about
and
in
a
twinkling
was
lost
to
our
view
in
the
gloom
by
this
time
night
had
fully
come
and
i
knew
the
lad
would
be
in
no
danger
if
he
made
a
direct
line
for
the
fort
therefore
i
ceased
to
think
of
him
as
i
urged
my
companion
to
return
with
me
to
where
we
could
overlook
the
scene
of
confusion
we
went
back
at
once
without
giving
especial
heed
to
moving
noiselessly
and
soon
were
gazing
upon
the
wildest
oddest
scene
that
ever
a
military
encampment
presented
during
the
short
time
we
were
absent
the
men
had
built
small
fires
here
there
and
everywhere
around
and
now
that
which
had
at
first
looked
like
a
panic
began
to
present
the
appearance
of
an
orgy
we
saw
directly
in
front
of
general
leger
camp
a
dozen
or
more
indians
broaching
a
cask
of
rum
and
hardly
more
than
twenty
feet
away
were
a
lot
of
tories
drinking
from
bottles
which
had
evidently
been
plundered
from
the
commander
private
store
had
the
camp
been
in
the
possession
of
an
enemy
there
could
not
have
been
greater
evidences
of
lawlessness
and
again
and
again
i
asked
myself
what
could
have
happened
to
bring
about
such
a
condition
of
affairs
it
would
be
impossible
to
set
down
all
the
wild
pictures
we
saw
during
the
hour
which
followed
instead
of
recovering
from
their
panic
insubordination
or
whatever
it
may
have
been
the
men
were
momentarily
growing
more
disorderly
and
that
the
officers
made
no
effort
to
preserve
even
the
semblance
of
order
we
knew
from
seeing
them
from
time
to
time
moving
about
the
encampment
with
no
heed
to
what
was
being
done
the
three
commanders
however
remained
beyond
our
line
of
vision
and
because
no
one
save
the
rioting
soldiery
and
the
savages
entered
or
came
out
of
the
headquarters
tent
i
began
to
suspect
that
the
leaders
had
run
away
as
can
be
supposed
in
a
comparatively
short
time
the
indians
were
thoroughly
under
the
influence
of
the
enormous
amount
of
strong
drink
which
had
been
consumed
and
ripe
for
mischief
of
any
kind
one
of
the
tories
a
fellow
who
had
been
with
the
savages
himself
drinking
until
he
could
stand
only
with
difficulty
was
set
upon
by
two
of
the
feathered
wolves
murdered
and
scalped
before
our
eyes
without
an
alarm
being
raised
then
the
indians
began
a
waving
the
bloody
scalp
in
the
air
with
frenzied
gestures
as
they
circled
around
and
around
the
lifeless
body
and
many
of
the
drunken
white
men
applauded
heartily
although
it
must
be
set
down
in
extenuation
that
they
were
so
drunk
as
not
really
to
understand
what
had
taken
place
it
a
nice
kind
of
a
sergeant
corney
whispered
to
me
while
the
orgy
was
at
its
height
if
the
rum
holds
out
these
villains
will
settle
matters
among
themselves
so
that
colonel
gansevoort
wo
find
any
to
stand
against
him
when
he
arrives
to
this
i
could
make
no
reply
i
was
literally
sickened
by
the
horrible
scene
and
began
to
wish
most
fervently
that
i
had
been
the
one
to
draw
the
shortest
twig
for
it
was
by
no
means
agreeable
to
remain
there
idle
while
murder
was
being
done
even
though
it
was
a
bitter
enemy
who
had
thus
been
cowardly
done
to
death
the
savages
soon
brought
their
dance
to
an
end
as
they
stumbled
into
this
tent
and
that
searching
for
more
spirits
although
the
cask
was
not
yet
empty
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
suggesting
to
sergeant
corney
that
it
would
be
wise
to
move
back
among
the
bushes
lest
some
of
the
drunkards
come
upon
us
by
mistake
when
a
heavy
body
suddenly
fell
or
was
thrown
directly
upon
my
back
pinning
me
to
the
earth
my
first
thought
was
that
the
rioters
had
flung
some
heavy
piece
of
camp
equipage
into
the
bushes
at
random
and
then
the
blood
grew
cold
in
my
veins
as
i
felt
two
hands
clutching
at
my
throat
like
a
flash
of
light
came
the
knowledge
that
one
of
the
drunkards
an
indian
as
i
believed
had
stumbled
upon
me
accidentally
i
expected
each
second
to
hear
an
alarm
raised
which
would
bring
the
murderous
crew
to
the
spot
without
delay
when
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
the
result
for
the
sergeant
and
i
could
not
hold
out
many
moments
against
such
a
mob
even
though
every
one
of
them
was
intoxicated
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
that
which
rendered
my
situation
critical
was
the
fact
of
my
being
virtually
unarmed
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
rifle
was
strapped
to
my
back
and
even
though
i
had
been
unhampered
it
would
have
required
no
slight
time
in
which
to
unsling
it
my
knife
was
quite
as
useless
because
borne
to
the
earth
as
i
had
been
it
could
not
be
removed
from
my
belt
to
set
all
this
down
in
words
makes
it
appear
as
if
i
had
ample
time
in
which
to
think
over
the
situation
whereas
no
more
than
five
seconds
could
have
elapsed
before
the
sinewy
fingers
were
closed
so
tightly
about
my
throat
that
i
could
not
breathe
at
almost
the
same
instant
that
the
pressure
began
to
be
painful
before
a
single
cry
had
been
uttered
by
my
assailant
a
second
shock
was
felt
by
me
while
the
weight
which
pressed
me
down
to
the
earth
was
increased
and
dimly
i
understood
that
the
sergeant
had
leaped
upon
the
back
of
him
who
was
strangling
me
why
the
indian
made
no
cry
for
help
i
can
not
understand
except
that
he
was
too
drunk
to
realize
he
had
within
his
grasp
an
enemy
instead
of
one
of
his
own
company
certain
it
is
however
that
no
alarm
was
raised
even
when
the
sergeant
came
to
my
relief
and
in
silence
save
for
the
rustling
of
the
foliage
as
we
swayed
to
this
side
or
that
the
battle
was
continued
until
i
felt
the
cruel
fingers
about
my
throat
suddenly
relax
while
a
warm
liquid
of
a
peculiar
salty
odor
poured
down
over
my
neck
and
head
when
he
who
had
been
striving
to
kill
me
rolled
from
my
back
i
lay
motionless
unable
to
raise
a
hand
and
gasping
for
breath
until
sergeant
corney
lifted
me
up
as
he
whispered
in
my
ear
are
you
hurt
lad
only
choked
to
death
i
contrived
to
say
and
then
tried
to
struggle
to
my
feet
but
found
myself
yet
pinned
to
the
earth
by
the
lifeless
body
which
lay
across
my
legs
let
us
get
out
of
here
i
said
after
releasing
myself
from
the
sinister
weight
this
is
worse
than
such
an
ambush
as
we
fell
into
on
the
oriskany
ay
lad
i
reckon
you
right
as
to
that
but
it
strikes
me
we
bound
by
the
word
i
sent
the
commandant
to
stay
here
till
we
make
certain
these
reptiles
do
come
to
their
senses
while
he
spoke
the
sergeant
was
helping
me
retreat
yet
farther
among
the
bushes
for
my
knees
bent
beneath
me
owing
to
the
horror
of
it
all
as
well
as
the
rough
handling
i
had
received
the
old
man
was
not
willing
to
move
so
far
away
that
it
would
not
be
possible
to
have
a
fairly
good
view
of
what
might
be
going
on
but
we
did
walk
to
what
i
believed
was
a
comparatively
safe
distance
and
then
sat
down
upon
the
ground
on
the
alert
for
anything
more
of
the
same
kind
which
had
come
so
near
to
putting
me
out
of
the
world
it
was
a
close
shave
lad
an
be
a
lesson
to
sich
fools
as
we
shown
ourselves
never
to
carry
good
weapons
where
they
ca
be
got
hold
of
for
use
at
a
moment
notice
a
fellow
is
supposed
to
be
on
his
guard
against
drunkards
i
replied
curtly
caressing
my
throat
which
was
exceeding
sore
true
for
you
lad
but
i
free
to
say
that
while
we
had
considerable
experience
in
the
business
of
fightin
i
never
run
up
agin
quite
sich
a
mess
as
this
it
actually
gives
me
a
pain
because
i
make
head
or
tail
of
it
i
was
already
weary
with
trying
to
solve
the
problem
for
indeed
it
was
puzzling
to
even
make
a
guess
at
why
an
army
of
near
to
seventeen
hundred
men
had
been
thrown
into
such
a
state
of
panic
and
lawlessness
then
again
why
were
the
commanders
not
present
with
their
officers
to
check
these
proceedings
why
had
they
allowed
the
men
to
take
part
in
such
an
orgy
for
to
my
knowledge
leger
was
near
at
hand
when
the
first
cask
of
rum
was
broached
it
is
no
use
to
speculate
as
to
how
this
thing
came
about
i
said
but
it
strikes
me
that
you
ought
to
post
yourself
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
tell
colonel
gansevoort
or
whoever
he
sends
in
command
of
the
detachment
exactly
where
the
blow
may
best
be
struck
for
just
now
all
we
know
is
regardin
the
row
close
hereabout
you
never
spoke
a
truer
word
in
your
life
lad
the
old
man
said
excitedly
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
i
got
so
mixed
up
with
this
hubbub
tryin
to
make
out
how
it
came
about
as
to
have
clean
lost
sight
of
all
that
a
soldier
ought
to
do
jacob
has
been
gone
over
an
hour
an
we
have
as
much
more
time
to
find
out
how
things
are
in
the
rest
of
the
encampment
so
let
set
about
it
without
delay
the
scene
immediately
before
us
was
so
revolting
that
i
had
no
desire
to
gaze
at
it
longer
and
there
was
a
certain
sense
of
relief
in
my
mind
when
the
sergeant
prompted
by
me
had
thus
decided
upon
a
definite
course
of
action
with
so
much
of
confusion
and
drunkenness
everywhere
around
it
was
a
simple
matter
for
us
to
go
and
come
as
we
pleased
save
by
chance
we
might
stumble
upon
those
who
yet
remained
sober
for
all
the
men
i
had
thus
far
seen
except
the
leaders
themselves
were
in
such
a
maudlin
condition
as
to
be
unable
to
distinguish
friend
from
foe
we
had
already
learned
that
the
batteries
fronting
fort
schuyler
on
the
northeast
had
been
abandoned
and
it
was
only
necessary
to
get
a
view
of
the
remainder
of
the
british
encampment
there
was
little
need
to
visit
the
tory
quarters
for
as
it
seemed
to
me
all
those
renegades
were
present
taking
part
in
the
orgy
with
no
care
as
to
advancing
noiselessly
but
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
lest
we
come
upon
sober
men
the
sergeant
and
i
moved
about
at
will
finding
everywhere
the
same
condition
of
affairs
and
when
half
an
hour
had
passed
it
was
positive
our
people
might
come
into
the
enemy
lines
and
gather
up
prisoners
by
the
hundreds
without
being
molested
in
any
way
for
i
question
if
their
presence
would
have
been
suspected
during
all
this
time
of
inspection
we
saw
nothing
of
leger
sir
john
or
thayendanega
and
i
was
of
the
opinion
that
they
had
run
away
but
sergeant
corney
held
to
it
that
most
like
they
were
in
the
indian
encampment
proposing
that
we
cross
the
river
in
order
to
hunt
them
up
but
to
this
i
would
not
listen
according
to
my
mind
such
of
the
indians
as
remained
sober
if
there
were
any
would
be
in
their
own
lodges
and
because
we
had
had
such
singular
success
in
our
scout
thus
far
was
no
reason
why
we
might
not
suddenly
find
ourselves
face
to
face
with
the
gravest
danger
if
we
acted
the
fools
by
poking
our
noses
among
the
camps
of
the
savages
why
not
go
to
the
fort
i
asked
there
is
nothin
more
to
be
learned
here
we
know
to
a
certainty
that
the
greater
portion
of
all
the
tories
an
indians
are
hereabout
and
every
one
of
them
so
drunk
that
the
army
will
be
harmless
save
as
to
each
other
until
daybreak
let
us
go
back
by
way
of
the
batteries
an
we
can
reach
the
fort
almost
as
soon
as
will
jacob
if
perchance
he
went
to
the
northward
of
the
hill
the
sergeant
was
not
inclined
to
leave
the
encampment
immediately
although
he
agreed
that
we
could
learn
nothing
further
of
importance
it
was
as
if
the
scene
of
confusion
had
a
certain
fascination
for
him
he
finally
agreed
however
unwillingly
to
my
proposition
and
we
set
out
leisurely
on
the
return
being
forced
to
pass
once
more
in
the
rear
of
all
the
british
camps
because
of
having
continued
our
investigations
to
the
easternmost
line
of
tents
we
began
the
return
without
thought
of
haste
or
of
danger
and
were
come
midway
between
headquarters
and
the
most
southerly
battery
when
without
warning
we
arrived
face
to
face
with
a
party
of
six
tories
who
with
their
arms
around
each
other
necks
were
reeling
to
and
fro
in
the
most
convivial
fashion
on
what
was
probably
intended
to
be
a
pleasant
stroll
in
the
night
air
just
for
an
instant
i
was
startled
fearing
lest
we
might
be
discovered
and
find
ourselves
in
trouble
when
we
believed
we
were
safest
but
then
realizing
that
we
had
already
met
many
who
mistook
us
for
comrades
i
would
have
gone
on
but
that
sergeant
corney
halted
suddenly
unslung
the
rifle
from
his
back
and
presenting
it
full
at
the
drunken
renegades
said
in
a
low
stern
tone
we
are
prepared
to
shoot
one
or
all
at
a
moment
notice
if
you
make
the
slightest
resistance
the
orders
are
to
gather
in
every
mother
son
in
this
encampment
who
has
been
makin
a
fool
of
himself
an
i
reckon
you
come
in
that
class
about
face
an
the
first
who
so
much
as
yips
gets
a
bullet
through
the
head
the
fellows
must
have
believed
that
we
were
acting
under
orders
from
their
general
for
with
many
a
laugh
and
quip
they
obeyed
the
sergeant
order
as
promptly
as
a
party
of
small
boys
would
have
done
and
still
supporting
each
other
moved
toward
the
fort
we
two
following
directly
in
the
rear
i
could
have
laughed
aloud
at
the
comical
situation
here
were
two
scouts
who
had
gone
out
to
spy
upon
an
encampment
of
seventeen
hundred
men
marching
boldly
through
the
entire
place
and
taking
as
prisoners
six
soldiers
who
made
no
effort
whatsoever
to
defend
themselves
i
question
if
in
the
annals
of
warfare
there
be
found
anything
that
can
match
such
a
situation
are
you
goin
to
take
them
into
the
fort
sergeant
i
asked
in
a
whisper
and
he
replied
speaking
with
difficulty
because
of
his
mirth
why
not
lad
it
will
be
a
rare
lark
an
somethin
to
tell
about
in
the
days
to
come
that
we
took
out
from
almost
directly
in
front
of
leger
headquarters
six
men
marchin
into
a
fort
which
was
supposed
to
be
closely
invested
there
could
be
little
danger
attending
such
a
performance
save
perchance
we
might
come
upon
some
of
those
who
were
sober
and
that
risk
i
was
more
than
willing
to
take
for
the
sake
as
the
sergeant
had
said
of
being
able
to
tell
the
story
in
the
future
we
marched
our
prisoners
out
past
the
batteries
they
giving
no
heed
to
the
direction
we
were
going
evidently
fancying
we
were
taking
them
to
the
until
arriving
midway
between
the
fort
and
the
redoubts
illustration
unless
you
achin
to
have
a
bullet
through
the
back
then
somewhat
of
the
truth
seemed
to
dawn
upon
them
and
this
was
so
startling
as
to
restore
a
portion
of
their
befuddled
senses
the
entire
party
halted
as
if
with
one
accord
and
would
have
turned
to
look
at
us
but
that
the
sergeant
said
sharply
emphasizing
the
words
by
the
click
of
his
as
he
cocked
the
weapon
keep
unless
you
achin
to
have
a
bullet
put
through
the
back
of
every
blessed
one
in
the
gang
but
look
here
this
is
too
much
of
a
joke
one
of
them
cried
with
a
drunken
laugh
we
ca
go
very
far
on
this
course
without
bein
seen
by
the
rebels
you
been
seen
by
already
an
that
why
we
got
you
in
charge
we
count
on
movin
the
whole
of
leger
force
over
to
the
fort
in
squads
an
you
the
first
that
has
been
started
on
the
road
by
this
time
the
renegades
had
a
fairly
good
idea
of
the
situation
and
i
fully
expected
they
would
turn
upon
us
but
each
of
them
was
a
coward
if
they
wheeled
about
suddenly
taking
the
chances
that
one
might
be
killed
in
the
squabble
it
would
have
been
possible
to
overpower
us
even
though
they
were
without
firearms
but
it
was
the
probability
of
our
doing
some
considerable
execution
before
knocking
under
that
prevented
them
from
escaping
at
the
favorable
moment
i
walked
with
my
rifle
cocked
and
pointed
at
the
man
directly
in
front
of
me
prodding
him
with
the
muzzle
now
and
then
that
he
might
know
i
was
ready
for
action
and
sergeant
corney
kept
the
whole
party
moving
at
a
good
smart
pace
for
we
had
no
assurance
that
there
were
not
sober
men
enough
in
the
enemy
camp
to
play
the
mischief
with
our
bold
plan
before
we
were
hailed
by
the
sentinels
i
came
to
believe
that
every
member
of
the
besieging
army
was
more
or
less
incapacitated
for
duty
through
having
drank
too
much
rum
for
we
heard
nothing
whatsoever
from
any
one
in
the
enemy
camp
although
we
were
in
fairly
good
view
of
them
for
no
less
than
half
an
hour
when
the
sentinel
hailed
we
were
yet
half
a
distant
and
my
companion
answered
it
by
shouting
report
to
the
officer
of
the
day
that
captain
campbell
of
the
minute
boys
an
sergeant
braun
unattached
are
come
with
a
few
prisoners
as
sample
of
what
may
be
had
for
the
takin
this
reply
caused
some
mystification
among
the
sentinels
as
we
could
understand
by
the
hum
of
conversation
which
followed
but
the
old
man
did
not
call
a
halt
and
we
continued
straight
on
toward
the
i
feeling
more
than
a
bit
nervous
lest
the
sergeant
loud
words
might
have
been
heard
by
such
of
the
enemy
as
were
able
to
come
in
pursuit
when
we
had
come
near
the
gate
the
tories
now
well
sobered
by
fright
colonel
gansevoort
himself
hailed
and
again
the
sergeant
replied
but
this
time
in
a
respectful
tone
after
which
we
heard
the
command
to
open
the
port
a
throng
of
curious
laughing
men
crowded
around
as
we
marched
in
and
not
until
the
uniforms
of
our
prisoners
could
be
seen
did
they
believe
we
had
really
made
a
capture
it
was
a
squad
of
johnson
greens
which
we
had
run
across
so
fortunately
and
accidentally
and
none
of
leger
force
could
have
been
more
welcome
to
our
lads
than
they
for
that
organization
was
made
up
wholly
of
renegades
from
the
mohawk
valley
who
needed
such
a
lesson
as
we
were
now
in
position
to
give
them
with
such
proof
as
we
had
with
us
colonel
gansevoort
could
no
longer
doubt
the
report
which
had
already
been
brought
in
by
jacob
he
had
not
thought
it
possible
the
entire
force
of
the
enemy
could
be
in
a
helpless
condition
and
it
is
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
was
incredulous
the
prisoners
were
speedily
cared
for
in
such
a
fashion
that
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
their
escaping
and
then
the
commandant
summoned
all
three
of
us
who
had
visited
the
british
encampment
to
his
headquarters
that
we
might
tell
the
story
to
himself
and
the
officers
no
one
could
even
make
a
guess
as
to
what
had
happened
within
the
lines
but
there
was
not
a
man
present
who
did
not
believe
that
now
had
come
our
time
to
raise
the
siege
in
such
a
manner
that
the
fort
would
not
be
invested
again
for
many
days
to
come
when
your
messenger
came
in
with
his
report
he
admitted
that
you
had
seen
but
a
small
portion
of
the
encampment
therefore
i
hesitated
to
accept
it
as
a
fact
regarding
the
entire
army
but
now
after
you
have
made
a
tour
of
the
works
it
would
be
worse
than
folly
to
delay
the
commandant
said
to
the
sergeant
if
you
who
have
so
lately
returned
want
to
join
in
the
sortie
it
will
be
necessary
to
make
your
preparations
quickly
and
the
old
man
replied
grimly
the
advance
ca
be
made
any
too
soon
to
please
us
sir
chapter
xix
the
pursuit
no
more
than
three
hundred
men
were
sent
out
to
take
advantage
of
the
singular
state
of
affairs
which
we
the
scouts
had
reported
as
existing
in
the
british
camp
and
when
i
expressed
surprise
because
of
the
small
number
ordered
on
duty
sergeant
corney
replied
contentedly
if
you
an
i
told
the
truth
lad
as
we
know
we
did
then
a
detachment
of
three
hundred
is
way
off
more
than
enough
to
take
care
of
all
army
in
its
present
condition
but
if
we
made
a
mistake
or
if
in
some
way
it
turned
out
to
be
a
big
trick
intended
for
our
undoin
though
i
see
how
it
be
then
have
men
in
plenty
been
taken
from
the
garrison
here
all
of
which
means
that
you
entirely
satisfied
with
everything
this
night
i
said
with
a
laugh
for
the
capture
of
the
tories
had
pleased
me
so
thoroughly
that
my
mouth
was
stretched
in
a
grin
nearly
all
the
time
that
about
the
size
of
it
lad
though
in
this
case
i
could
find
anythin
to
be
disgruntled
with
however
soreheaded
i
might
be
the
colonel
is
sendin
out
men
in
plenty
it
was
captain
jackman
who
led
the
force
and
i
knew
full
well
that
if
it
was
possible
to
punish
the
britishers
he
was
the
one
above
all
others
to
tackle
the
job
for
a
braver
more
man
i
have
never
seen
it
is
well
that
i
make
the
story
short
so
far
as
our
own
movements
were
concerned
for
what
we
said
or
did
before
visiting
the
enemy
camp
in
force
is
of
very
little
importance
we
set
off
within
an
hour
after
sergeant
corney
and
i
brought
in
the
prisoners
and
were
marched
boldly
across
the
plain
on
a
for
the
batteries
without
hearing
a
single
note
of
alarm
it
seemed
to
me
that
even
the
noises
of
the
orgy
had
died
away
arriving
at
the
batteries
captain
jackman
ordered
thirty
of
his
force
to
take
possession
of
the
guns
and
hold
them
until
the
last
possible
moment
in
case
the
enemy
rallied
sufficiently
to
do
anything
toward
caring
for
their
own
safety
a
few
yards
farther
on
at
the
redoubts
covering
the
batteries
thirty
more
men
were
left
and
since
there
was
an
ample
supply
of
ammunition
for
the
big
guns
as
well
as
the
small
arms
we
who
were
entering
the
encampment
would
have
a
fine
support
in
case
of
trouble
all
these
precautions
were
proper
and
the
captain
would
have
been
a
poor
soldier
indeed
had
he
failed
to
take
them
but
as
was
soon
shown
they
were
needless
when
we
arrived
near
general
leger
quarters
we
saw
the
last
of
the
army
fleeing
as
if
in
the
direction
of
oneida
lake
no
longer
preserving
any
semblance
of
military
formation
but
each
man
for
himself
and
what
was
yet
more
puzzling
their
indian
allies
were
in
close
pursuit
striking
down
laggards
whenever
the
opportunity
offered
these
warriors
of
whom
thayendanega
had
been
so
proud
were
taking
tory
and
british
scalps
as
if
they
had
been
summoned
for
no
other
purpose
and
during
two
or
three
minutes
all
our
people
stood
as
if
suddenly
turned
into
graven
images
so
much
of
astonishment
and
bewilderment
was
caused
by
the
wonderful
change
in
affairs
captain
jackman
first
act
after
understanding
that
the
enemy
was
actually
in
retreat
with
their
former
allies
harassing
the
fleeing
men
to
the
best
of
their
ability
was
to
send
a
messenger
in
hot
haste
to
the
fort
with
the
word
that
he
counted
on
taking
his
entire
force
save
those
left
to
hold
the
batteries
and
redoubts
in
pursuit
and
advising
that
nearly
all
the
british
equipment
could
be
seized
upon
without
fear
of
interruption
then
we
began
the
pursuit
and
this
like
the
panic
in
the
camp
was
the
oddest
ever
known
british
regulars
and
tories
running
casting
aside
their
weapons
and
accoutrements
lest
they
be
impeded
in
the
unreasoning
flight
and
close
at
their
heels
the
savages
who
fell
upon
every
unarmed
man
they
saw
sometimes
killing
him
outright
but
in
many
cases
which
came
under
my
personal
observation
disabling
and
then
scalping
the
poor
wretch
leaving
him
to
a
lingering
death
more
than
once
did
the
frightened
soldiers
flee
toward
us
for
protection
and
again
and
again
we
lent
them
weapons
with
which
to
defend
themselves
against
their
late
friends
it
is
almost
impossible
to
give
any
details
of
that
pursuit
which
was
not
brought
to
an
end
until
we
were
close
upon
the
shore
of
oneida
lake
because
it
was
all
so
confusing
more
like
the
wildest
kind
of
a
wherein
each
man
was
trying
to
gain
the
lead
and
the
hindermost
frantic
with
fear
it
would
have
been
strange
indeed
had
our
people
been
able
to
hold
anything
like
a
military
formation
captain
jackman
yelled
himself
hoarse
trying
to
keep
us
together
and
when
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
on
the
point
of
succeeding
some
one
would
set
off
at
a
mad
pace
to
save
the
life
of
a
british
soldier
who
had
fallen
at
the
mercy
of
a
savage
at
first
we
turned
our
attention
to
taking
prisoners
but
before
having
left
the
main
encampment
a
mile
in
the
rear
the
indians
eager
for
scalps
began
to
grow
careless
of
what
we
might
do
and
then
we
paid
off
many
an
old
score
although
all
could
not
have
been
settled
had
we
slaughtered
every
last
one
of
them
during
that
time
of
pursuit
we
saw
nothing
of
the
leaders
and
i
had
come
to
believe
that
they
were
among
the
first
to
flee
when
suddenly
the
sergeant
in
whose
company
jacob
and
i
had
remained
pointed
out
amid
the
bushes
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
portmanteau
which
had
evidently
been
cast
aside
by
some
of
the
fugitives
in
the
excitement
of
the
chase
either
jacob
or
i
would
have
passed
it
by
as
being
of
no
particular
value
when
there
were
so
many
things
to
be
picked
up
but
the
old
man
was
too
good
and
experienced
a
soldier
not
to
realize
the
possibilities
of
the
find
and
heedless
of
all
the
wild
scenes
around
him
he
seized
upon
it
breaking
the
lock
with
a
rock
then
it
was
we
learned
that
the
apparently
valueless
case
was
none
other
than
the
or
official
portfolio
belonging
to
general
leger
himself
and
in
it
were
not
only
private
letters
and
documents
but
all
his
correspondence
and
papers
relating
to
the
campaign
such
as
afterward
served
to
show
that
the
king
officers
had
actually
hired
the
indians
to
murder
those
whom
they
called
rebels
i
reckon
we
captured
the
prize
of
the
day
the
sergeant
said
gleefully
after
making
certain
as
to
the
contents
of
the
case
this
is
of
more
value
than
a
score
of
prisoners
although
there
far
less
satisfaction
in
seizin
it
a
moment
later
the
old
man
began
to
understand
that
if
he
held
on
to
the
prize
he
would
be
left
far
behind
in
the
chase
by
our
people
because
it
was
far
too
cumbersome
to
be
carried
at
a
rapid
pace
and
then
he
regretted
having
found
it
i
believe
that
for
a
moment
he
had
it
in
his
mind
to
throw
the
heavy
portfolio
away
willing
to
lose
what
he
believed
to
be
the
most
valuable
of
all
the
plunder
that
might
be
found
rather
than
miss
the
excitement
of
the
chase
but
fortunately
just
then
john
sammons
came
limping
back
with
a
wound
in
the
leg
which
had
been
inflicted
by
a
savage
whom
he
afterward
succeeded
in
killing
it
the
toughest
kind
of
to
be
crippled
just
when
the
fun
is
the
hottest
he
said
after
explaining
how
the
wound
had
been
received
i
ca
go
on
an
i
do
want
to
miss
the
show
when
the
crazy
britishers
an
tories
arrive
at
the
shore
of
the
lake
it
looks
pretty
bad
sergeant
corney
said
when
he
had
made
the
most
careless
examination
of
the
wound
and
i
was
surprised
to
hear
him
speak
in
such
a
tone
for
it
was
not
his
custom
to
make
much
ado
over
any
injury
however
severe
i
reckon
you
better
hobble
back
to
the
fort
without
delay
an
once
there
look
well
to
it
that
you
wash
an
bandage
the
leg
well
i
i
have
to
go
sammons
replied
with
a
sigh
and
the
sergeant
made
haste
to
add
of
course
you
will
lad
an
i
got
here
that
which
will
ensure
you
a
warm
reception
by
colonel
gansevoort
take
this
case
to
him
an
be
glad
you
had
to
go
back
then
it
was
that
i
understood
why
the
old
man
was
so
solicitous
regarding
john
injury
sammons
took
up
the
bulky
portfolio
and
limped
back
in
the
direction
of
the
fort
the
sergeant
saying
with
a
peculiar
twinkle
of
the
eyes
as
the
lad
passed
beyond
earshot
now
i
reckon
there
nothin
to
prevent
us
from
goin
on
so
long
as
do
the
others
strike
out
lively
lads
we
wasted
too
much
time
already
then
we
tailed
on
behind
the
crowd
of
our
people
who
howled
and
yelled
as
if
at
a
fair
shooting
at
every
bunch
of
feathers
we
saw
amid
the
foliage
but
making
no
effort
to
capture
the
fugitives
lest
we
find
ourselves
so
hampered
that
further
advance
would
be
out
of
the
question
there
were
many
of
our
people
who
thought
much
as
we
did
on
that
day
otherwise
fort
schuyler
might
have
been
crowded
with
prisoners
before
morning
when
we
had
finally
come
within
sight
of
the
lake
it
was
to
find
the
foremost
of
our
party
drawn
up
in
something
approaching
military
order
captain
jackman
had
succeeded
in
bringing
them
to
a
halt
while
yet
half
a
mile
from
the
shore
and
this
was
done
because
the
british
and
tories
had
made
a
stand
while
their
boats
which
had
been
left
at
that
point
when
they
marched
to
the
investment
of
fort
schuyler
could
be
put
in
sailing
trim
we
of
the
american
army
were
far
too
few
in
numbers
to
risk
an
action
by
pressing
on
for
no
matter
how
demoralized
the
enemy
had
become
during
the
flight
it
was
more
than
probable
they
would
fight
with
desperation
now
safety
was
within
view
more
than
one
of
our
party
cried
out
in
anger
because
the
captain
displayed
too
much
caution
according
to
their
ideas
but
the
among
whom
was
sergeant
corney
declared
that
it
would
be
the
height
of
folly
for
us
to
throw
ourselves
upon
at
least
a
thousand
men
when
no
great
good
could
come
from
such
a
venture
and
much
of
disaster
to
the
cause
might
result
the
savages
had
no
such
reason
for
lagging
however
nor
did
they
intend
to
fall
upon
their
late
friends
in
a
manner
which
could
involve
them
in
a
pitched
battle
but
yet
they
did
a
large
amount
of
mischief
without
putting
their
precious
bodies
in
danger
wherever
a
squad
of
the
fugitives
was
withdrawn
from
the
main
body
making
ready
a
boat
the
painted
fiends
would
swoop
down
upon
it
performing
their
murderous
work
and
getting
away
with
a
fresh
supply
of
scalps
before
the
victims
friends
could
rush
to
their
assistance
i
saw
a
boat
laden
with
men
the
greater
number
of
whom
were
unarmed
because
of
having
thrown
away
their
weapons
during
the
flight
push
off
in
company
with
several
others
but
the
oarsmen
of
this
particular
craft
were
clumsy
and
she
drifted
down
the
shore
until
beyond
range
of
the
remainder
of
the
force
then
it
was
that
the
wolves
began
shooting
at
the
helpless
men
until
a
full
half
of
the
crew
were
wounded
after
which
thayendanega
beauties
swam
out
to
her
killing
and
scalping
all
on
board
this
is
but
a
single
instance
of
what
the
savages
did
during
that
mad
retreat
more
than
once
had
my
rifle
been
emptied
in
behalf
of
some
soldier
and
i
even
went
so
far
in
my
sympathy
for
the
white
men
that
i
saved
the
life
of
a
tory
who
would
have
been
killed
had
we
not
come
up
in
the
nick
of
time
after
rescuing
him
however
we
turned
the
fellow
over
to
a
squad
who
were
guarding
twenty
or
more
prisoners
thus
making
certain
he
would
not
be
left
at
liberty
to
work
mischief
among
our
people
the
following
brief
account
of
the
retreat
was
written
and
printed
by
one
who
took
every
care
to
learn
all
the
truth
regarding
the
affair
and
i
set
it
down
here
that
he
who
reads
may
know
i
have
not
exaggerated
the
story
for
the
purpose
of
shaming
the
enemy
the
indians
it
is
said
made
merry
at
the
precipitate
flight
of
the
whites
who
threw
away
their
arms
and
knapsacks
so
that
nothing
should
impede
their
progress
the
savages
also
gratified
their
passion
for
murder
and
plunder
by
killing
many
of
the
retreating
allies
on
the
borders
of
the
lake
and
stripping
them
of
every
article
of
value
they
also
plundered
them
of
their
boats
and
according
to
leger
more
formidable
than
the
enemy
they
had
to
expect
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
captain
jackman
gave
us
the
word
to
turn
back
he
would
have
returned
sooner
but
our
men
pleaded
for
permission
to
watch
the
fugitives
until
they
had
embarked
and
he
could
hardly
do
otherwise
than
remain
a
happy
company
it
was
that
marched
back
to
what
had
been
the
british
encampment
there
to
find
many
of
those
we
had
left
in
the
fort
busily
engaged
hauling
in
the
plunder
abandoned
by
his
valiant
army
to
the
fortification
now
we
had
ammunition
in
plenty
both
for
our
own
guns
and
those
we
brought
in
from
the
batteries
while
there
was
such
a
store
of
provisions
that
the
wagons
were
kept
busy
during
the
entire
night
transporting
it
we
feasted
from
sunset
until
sunrise
much
after
the
fashion
of
the
savages
for
it
made
a
fellow
feel
good
to
know
from
actual
test
that
there
was
no
longer
any
need
of
saving
every
scrap
of
food
against
that
day
when
it
might
be
necessary
to
fight
and
fast
at
the
same
time
even
though
we
had
not
thus
made
merry
i
question
if
there
was
a
man
among
us
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
who
could
have
closed
his
eyes
in
slumber
the
relief
of
mind
was
so
great
and
the
wonderment
because
of
what
had
happened
so
overpowering
that
we
were
able
to
do
nothing
save
discuss
the
matter
again
and
again
but
without
coming
to
any
satisfactory
solution
of
the
riddle
the
tory
encampment
which
was
a
long
distance
westward
from
quarters
presented
the
same
scene
of
confusion
and
evidences
of
hasty
departure
as
had
the
british
and
from
there
we
got
a
large
quantity
of
plunder
but
in
the
indian
camp
was
nothing
left
but
the
lodges
and
these
we
carted
into
the
fort
although
they
would
be
of
little
value
to
us
it
was
satisfying
to
despoil
thayendanega
snakes
even
though
only
to
a
slight
extent
when
another
day
had
come
colonel
gansevoort
brought
all
us
merrymakers
up
with
a
sharp
turn
by
forcing
us
to
perform
military
duty
once
more
the
stores
of
the
british
and
tories
had
all
been
brought
in
and
then
we
were
called
upon
to
level
the
earthworks
which
had
been
thrown
up
at
the
beginning
of
the
siege
lest
general
burgoyne
who
had
been
reported
as
possibly
coming
our
way
might
be
able
to
turn
them
to
his
own
advantage
and
our
discomfiture
it
was
downright
hard
work
to
handle
shovel
and
pick
hour
after
hour
under
the
burning
rays
of
the
summer
sun
but
no
fellow
cared
to
show
himself
indolent
after
having
had
such
rare
good
fortune
and
we
petitioned
the
commandant
to
let
us
continue
the
labor
throughout
the
night
to
the
end
that
it
might
the
sooner
be
performed
within
six
and
thirty
hours
after
we
had
returned
from
the
pursuit
matters
were
so
far
straightened
that
we
had
nothing
save
ordinary
garrison
duty
to
perform
and
we
lounged
around
discussing
the
exciting
and
mysterious
events
which
we
had
witnessed
until
i
dare
venture
to
say
that
every
man
was
absolutely
weary
with
so
much
messengers
had
been
sent
on
the
road
toward
stillwater
to
learn
if
possible
what
had
caused
such
a
panic
among
the
enemy
and
sergeant
corney
said
to
jacob
and
me
while
we
were
waiting
with
whatsoever
of
patience
we
could
command
for
some
definite
information
to
be
brought
in
we
must
get
out
of
this
lads
within
four
an
twenty
hours
after
the
matter
has
been
made
plain
an
we
know
somewhat
concernin
the
movements
of
our
friends
on
the
outside
how
surprised
the
people
of
cherry
valley
will
be
when
they
hear
all
that
we
can
tell
them
jacob
said
as
if
speaking
to
himself
an
is
it
in
your
mind
lad
that
we
to
go
back
there
rather
than
anywhere
else
where
else
could
we
go
i
asked
in
surprise
i
been
thinkin
that
we
might
do
our
people
at
home
more
good
by
marchin
the
minute
boys
to
where
they
could
be
of
real
service
than
goin
back
to
let
loaf
the
settlement
at
that
moment
the
old
soldier
was
called
away
to
attend
to
some
duty
and
jacob
and
i
had
ample
food
for
thought
as
we
turned
over
in
mind
what
he
had
said
before
the
day
had
come
to
an
end
we
had
reinforcements
when
we
no
longer
needed
them
in
plenty
company
after
company
of
soldiers
marched
in
from
the
direction
of
stillwater
and
through
the
earliest
arrivals
we
learned
that
twelve
hundred
men
under
general
benedict
arnold
had
been
sent
to
our
relief
to
our
great
joy
they
could
give
valuable
information
regarding
the
strange
behavior
of
leger
army
and
by
putting
together
this
and
that
bit
of
news
we
had
a
fairly
good
solution
to
the
puzzle
before
the
arrival
of
general
arnold
who
came
with
a
small
force
twenty
hours
behind
the
main
body
and
this
is
the
story
as
we
heard
it
from
one
source
and
another
until
there
could
be
no
question
but
that
we
had
all
the
facts
with
no
embellishments
colonel
willett
and
lieutenant
stockwell
succeeded
in
getting
past
the
several
encampments
without
being
discovered
and
made
their
way
to
german
flats
there
they
procured
horses
and
rode
at
full
speed
until
arriving
at
the
headquarters
of
general
schuyler
at
stillwater
now
it
must
be
understood
that
when
general
washington
heard
the
news

it

have
heard
it
said
by
those
who
knew
and

immediately
the

from

to

he
found
that
the

were
bitterly
opposed
to
weakening
the
force

at

by
sending
any
away
even
on
so
important
a
mission
as
that
of
aiding
the
beleaguered
garrison
here
is
what
i
have
seen
printed
regarding
the
matter
and
i
will
copy
it
lest
any
one
think
i
may
have
imagined
some
portion
of
this
contention
which
as
we
look
at
the
situation
now
seems
so
improbable
for
one
can
hardly
believe
that
any
officer
in
the
patriot
army
would
have
refused
at
such
a
time
to
aid
those
who
were

sorely
pressed

were

accordingly
twelve

that
after

he
had
only
reached

that
no

should
be
lost
and
that
everything
should
be
done
to
encourage
the
garrison
and
dishearten
the
enemy
he
had
recourse
to
a
stratagem
which
succeeded
beyond
his
utmost
anticipation
a
party
of
tory
spies
had
just
been
arrested
in
the
neighborhood
and
among
them
was
a
certain
yan
yost
cuyler
a
queer
fellow
not
devoid
of
cunning
whom
the
indians
regarded
with
that
mysterious
awe
with
which
fools
and
lunatics
are
wont
to
inspire
them
as
creatures
possessed
with

yan
yost
was
summarily
condemned
to
death
and
his
brother
and
mother
in
wild
alarm
hastened
to
the
camp
to
plead
for
his
life
arnold
for
awhile
was
inexorable

presently
offered
to
pardon
the
culprit
on
condition
that
he
should
go
and
spread
a
panic
in

joyfully
consented
and
started
off
forthwith
while

as

of
his

to
make
the

through

that

was
coming

carried

were
standing
about

consultation
yan
yost
came
running
in
with
a
dozen
in

in

said
that
he
had
barely
escaped
with

american
host
which
was
close
at
hand
as
many
knew
him

tale

and
when
interrogated
as
to
the
numbers
of
the
advancing

he
gave
a

chapter

enlisted
men
on
the
morning
after
general
arnold
arrival
when
we
learned
that
the
reinforcements
which
had
been
sent
to
us
at
fort
schuyler
were
to
be
marched
directly
back
to
the
main
army
then
at
stillwater
the
minute
boys
held
a
conference
to
decide
what
should
be
done
for
it
was
in
my
mind
that
each
member
of
the
company
had
a
right
to
discuss
freely
the
question
that
must
be
settled
without
delay
we
knew
that
peter
sitz
was
to
return
to
cherry
valley
as
soon
as
he
could
make
ready
for
the
journey
and
i
was
of
the
belief
that
jacob
desired
to
accompany
his
father
but
never
a
word
had
passed
between
us
on
the
subject
from
all
we
could
hear
concerning
affairs
in
the
mohawk
valley
it
seemed
much
as
if
the
senseless
panic
among
leger
force
had
resulted
in
breaking
up
the
combination
between
the
british
and
the
indians
in
which
case
thayendanega
would
not
be
able
to
ravage
the
country
nearabout
cherry
valley
as
he
had
doubtless
counted
on
when
i
considered
the
matter
with
a
sickness
for
home
in
my
heart
it
seemed
much
as
if
my
proper
place
was
with
my
parents
and
there
if
trouble
should
come
i
would
be
able
to
strike
a
blow
in
defence
of
those
i
loved
but
while
listening
to
the
conversation
of
the
soldiers
and
being
brought
to
understand
how
sorely
the
colonists
needed
the
aid
which
should
come
from
their
midst
i
said
to
myself
that
strong
hulking
lads
like
our
minute
boys
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
do
other
than
remain
in
the
service
doing
their
part
in
showing
the
king
that
we
would
have
no
more
of
his
misrule
it
seemed
to
me
that
sergeant
corney
was
averse
to
talking
with
any
of
us
concerning
the
future
for
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
we
must
decide
at
once
upon
some
course
he
kept
aloof
whenever
he
heard
two
or
three
discussing
the
question
of
what
we
minute
boys
ought
to
do
now
that
we
were
no
longer
needed
at
fort
schuyler
i
have
thus
set
down
that
which
was
in
my
mind
at
the
time
not
that
it
is
of
any
especial
importance
but
to
the
end
that
he
who
reads
may
understand
how
undecided
i
was
as
to
what
my
company
had
best
do
at
such
a
time
and
i
believe
every
person
will
realize
that
a
lad
love
for
country
must
be
great
when
it
prompts
him
to
turn
his
back
on
home
and
loved
ones
after
having
passed
through
as
many
dangers
as
had
our
boys
from
cherry
valley
during
the
evening
previous
i
had
notified
all
the
members
of
the
company
that
we
would
meet
in
the
barracks
at
eight
in
the
morning
to
decide
what
course
should
be
pursued
and
considerably
before
the
time
set
every
lad
was
in
waiting
but
sergeant
corney
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
we
had
come
to
consider
him
as
the
head
and
front
of
the
minute
boys
and
his
absence
at
such
an
important
time
seemed
odd
to
say
the
least
i
believe
he
has
it
in
mind
to
join
general
arnold
force
john
sammons
said
when
the
hour
for
the
conference
had
come
and
passed
without
the
sergeant
having
shown
himself
and
the
idea
of
such
a
possibility
brought
a
strange
sensation
of
loneliness
to
my
heart
then
jacob
suggested
that
the
old
man
might
have
been
detained
against
his
will
at
headquarters
and
i
proposed
that
the
lad
go
at
once
to
learn
if
such
was
the
case
he
did
not
absolutely
refuse
to
obey
what
might
have
been
considered
as
an
order
from
the
captain
but
tried
to
shift
the
duty
by
saying
it
would
be
of
more
avail
for
you
to
go
noel
if
so
be
the
old
man
really
has
it
in
mind
to
enlist
under
general
arnold
you
have
ever
been
a
favorite
of
his
whereas
i
am
little
more
than
an
outsider
who
has
caused
you
an
he
much
trouble
an
sufferin
the
lad
did
not
really
believe
his
own
statements
but
made
them
simply
to
shift
the
duty
to
my
shoulders
for
it
was
a
bold
and
might
be
considered
an
impertinent
act
for
us
to
presume
to
advise
or
urge
one
of
so
much
and
so
varied
experience
as
sergeant
corney
i
set
off
without
further
parley
and
to
my
great
surprise
found
the
old
man
on
the
talking
idly
with
peter
sitz
had
you
forgotten
that
the
company
was
called
together
at
eight
this
mornin
i
asked
as
if
in
surprise
not
a
bit
of
it
lad
then
why
did
you
come
to
the
barracks
i
knew
you
lads
had
somewhat
of
importance
to
decide
an
was
on
goin
where
i
might
be
said
to
have
influenced
you
but
do
you
reckon
yourself
as
belongin
any
longer
to
the
company
i
did
count
on
bein
able
to
pass
myself
off
for
a
boy
even
among
blind
men
the
old
soldier
said
with
a
laugh
and
i
cried
hotly
that
is
answerin
my
question
sergeant
is
there
any
good
reason
why
you
should
stand
stiffly
here
while
we
tryin
to
make
up
our
minds
what
to
do
yes
lad
i
believe
there
is
what
may
it
be
if
you
willin
to
tell
us
it
should
be
hard
to
guess
all
my
life
long
i
followed
as
another
man
follows
a
trade
an
i
not
the
one
who
ought
to
speak
when
lads
are
makin
up
their
minds
as
to
the
future
lest
i
say
that
which
pleases
me
an
may
not
be
the
best
thing
for
them
answer
me
one
question
squarely
sergeant
corney
without
beatin
about
the
bush
do
you
think
we
too
young
to
enlist
as
soldiers
if
it
so
be
the
lads
decide
that
the
minute
boys
ought
to
do
all
they
can
for
the
cause
not
a
bit
of
it
it
strikes
me
your
company
has
shown
that
it
may
be
of
value
in
any
army
an
i
go
bail
colonel
gansevoort
will
agree
with
me
what
say
you
peter
sitz
speakin
for
my
jacob
he
shown
that
his
services
are
not
to
be
despised
in
sich
warfare
as
we
like
to
have
in
the
valley
but
it
must
be
for
him
to
say
what
he
do
without
word
or
look
from
me
now
it
was
that
i
began
to
understand
what
these
two
were
driving
at
they
were
minded
that
we
of
the
company
should
decide
the
question
before
us
without
aid
from
them
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
that
in
their
opinion
the
minute
boys
ought
to
remain
where
they
could
do
the
best
service
for
the
colony
however
i
was
determined
that
they
should
be
present
while
we
discussed
the
matter
and
by
dint
of
much
coaxing
finally
succeeded
in
my
purpose
when
we
were
all
together
i
put
the
matter
before
the
lads
to
the
best
of
my
ability
asking
each
to
say
if
he
was
minded
to
go
home
at
once
or
whether
he
would
be
willing
to
regularly
enlist
in
the
american
army
and
before
any
other
could
speak
john
sammons
made
a
suggestion
which
showed
him
to
be
a
lad
of
rare
good
sense
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
first
learn
whether
wanted
in
the
army
there
hardly
one
among
us
of
an
age
to
be
taken
as
a
recruit
an
if
they
wo
let
us
enlist
as
a
full
company
allowin
our
own
officers
to
remain
in
command
i
for
my
part
would
rather
go
home
there
could
be
no
question
but
that
very
many
of
us
shared
john
ideas
and
then
came
the
question
as
to
how
we
might
learn
what
we
wanted
to
know
this
we
could
not
determine
upon
until
peter
sitz
said
quietly
most
likely
colonel
gansevoort
can
tell
you
in
short
order
but
if
he
ca
he
wo
be
long
in
findin
out
from
general
arnold
this
was
just
the
suggestion
we
needed
and
then
came
the
question
as
to
who
would
go
to
the
commandant
i
flatly
refused
because
it
would
look
too
much
as
if
i
was
eager
to
hold
my
rank
as
captain
and
after
considerable
it
was
decided
that
jacob
should
tackle
the
job
his
father
agreeing
to
go
with
him
to
headquarters
while
these
two
were
absent
we
talked
much
among
ourselves
and
i
soon
learned
that
every
member
of
the
company
was
willing
to
remain
in
service
if
it
could
be
done
as
regularly
enlisted
men
holding
together
as
a
separate
company
sergeant
corney
would
take
no
part
in
the
discussion
he
flatly
refused
to
give
an
opinion
until
after
the
matter
had
been
fully
decided
but
i
knew
full
well
the
old
man
would
remain
with
us
even
though
we
were
only
a
company
of
boys
then
jacob
and
his
father
returned
and
there
was
no
need
of
further
talk
the
commandant
says
that
we
have
only
to
present
ourselves
before
general
schuyler
in
order
to
be
enlisted
as
we
desire
jacob
reported
he
promises
to
write
a
letter
to
the
general
at
once
telling
him
of
how
much
service
we
have
been
here
in
the
fort
an
agrees
to
provide
us
with
provisions
for
the
march
with
two
to
haul
the
stores
we
to
have
from
the
plunder
gotten
out
of
leger
camp
all
we
may
need
in
way
of
an
outfit
so
that
we
really
show
up
before
the
commander
equipped
for
service
without
cost
to
the
colonies
thus
the
matter
was
settled
with
such
a
generous
offer
from
the
commandant
never
a
member
of
the
company
could
have
hung
back
had
he
so
desired
but
i
am
proud
to
say
that
each
and
every
one
of
them
was
eager
to
join
the
army
since
it
might
be
done
as
regular
soldiers
then
it
was
that
sergeant
corney
had
his
say
and
he
was
by
no
means
niggardly
with
words
first
he
congratulated
us
on
having
performed
such
good
service
that
the
commander
under
whom
we
served
was
pleased
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
give
us
a
good
and
then
declared
that
he
had
rather
enlist
with
us
than
in
any
regiment
of
the
army
if
we
had
decided
to
go
to
cherry
valley
it
was
his
purpose
to
join
general
arnold
force
but
now
that
he
could
remain
with
the
minute
boys
he
was
content
we
were
proud
lads
that
day
for
it
seemed
as
if
every
officer
and
soldier
in
the
fort
was
eager
to
give
us
some
word
of
praise
and
those
with
whom
we
had
served
watched
jealously
when
our
equipment
was
being
selected
from
the
plunder
of
the
british
camp
lest
we
might
not
get
the
best
of
everything
we
had
our
hands
full
of
business
making
ready
for
the
march
when
reuben
cox
came
shyly
up
to
where
sergeant
corney
and
i
were
looking
after
the
stowage
of
goods
in
the
wagons
and
said
to
me
in
a
as
if
fearing
others
might
hear
him
i
do
reckon
your
company
is
any
place
for
a
man
who
has
shown
himself
sich
a
sneak
as
i
am
eh
would
you
like
to
go
with
us
i
asked
in
surprise
and
pitying
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
the
man
who
was
so
deeply
repentant
that
i
would
captain
campbell
it
may
be
in
time
i
can
live
down
my
record
providin
there
be
any
one
who
look
to
what
i
may
do
instead
of
always
thinkin
of
what
i
have
done
but
the
men
in
the
fort
have
been
kind
to
you
of
late
cox
i
said
questioningly
ay
that
they
have
considerin
what
i
done
an
how
nearly
i
came
to
workin
the
worst
of
harm
to
all
hands
here
but
i
can
see
by
their
eyes
that
they
always
thinkin
i
may
play
the
same
dirty
game
agin
though
god
knows
i
stand
at
the
stake
with
never
a
whimper
till
the
life
was
burned
out
of
me
rather
than
do
one
of
them
another
wrong
had
i
felt
at
liberty
to
decide
the
matter
then
and
there
cox
would
have
been
a
member
of
the
minute
boys
without
further
parley
but
it
was
only
right
i
should
consult
the
others
therefore
i
told
him
to
come
again
within
an
hour
when
i
would
give
him
an
answer
he
thanked
me
humbly
and
was
about
to
go
away
when
sergeant
corney
took
him
by
the
hand
as
he
said
what
in
the
past
ca
be
brought
back
for
the
fixin
but
we
got
in
our
own
keepin
the
shapin
of
the
i
thinkin
you
wo
go
astray
agin
reuben
cox
an
whenever
i
see
a
chance
to
speak
a
good
word
for
you
it
shall
be
said
the
man
face
lighted
up
wonderfully
and
in
my
heart
i
thanked
the
old
sergeant
over
and
over
for
having
been
thus
kind
to
one
who
having
committed
the
worst
crime
possible
for
a
soldier
stood
ready
to
give
up
his
life
cheerfully
to
the
end
that
he
might
atone
i
called
the
lads
together
without
loss
of
time
repeating
to
them
what
cox
had
said
and
again
was
i
made
glad
when
they
agreed
without
hesitation
to
take
him
among
us
john
sammons
was
sent
to
bring
up
the
new
member
of
the
company
and
sergeant
corney
said
grimly
as
he
tried
without
avail
to
pucker
his
wrinkled
face
into
a
frown
at
this
rate
you
soon
lose
the
right
to
call
yourselves
minute
because
this
company
is
fast
becomin
a
refuge
for
the
aged
and
outcast
there
was
to
be
mourning
as
well
as
gladness
among
us
on
this
the
last
day
we
were
to
spend
in
fort
schuyler
toward
noon
a
messenger
from
the
general
commanding
came
in
bringing
with
him
the
sad
news
that
general
herkimer
was
dead
of
his
wounds
or
perhaps
i
should
say
because
of
his
wounds
as
we
were
told
the
general
was
safely
taken
to
his
home
after
the
battle
being
carried
on
a
litter
the
entire
distance
the
weather
was
very
warm
and
soon
the
wound
became
gangrenous
nine
days
after
his
arrival
a
young
french
surgeon
who
had
been
with
general
arnold
force
visited
the
house
and
claimed
that
the
injured
limb
should
be
cut
off
without
delay
as
the
only
means
of
saving
the
sufferer
life
the
family
doctor
objected
very
strongly
but
the
general
family
had
faith
in
the
frenchman
although
it
is
claimed
he
had
evidently
been
drinking
heavily
and
the
leg
was
cut
off
the
operation
was
performed
so
unskilfully
that
it
was
impossible
to
entirely
check
the
flow
of
blood
and
the
frenchman
indulging
in
more
wine
became
so
badly
intoxicated
that
even
had
he
known
how
it
would
have
been
beyond
his
power
to
take
the
proper
measures
there
was
no
other
surgeon
to
be
had
and
toward
the
close
of
the
day
when
the
brave
old
general
came
to
understand
that
his
end
was
very
near
he
asked
for
the
bible
from
which
he
read
aloud
the
psalm
immediately
afterward
sinking
back
upon
the
pillow
dead
murdered
if
ever
a
man
was
sergeant
corney
cried
when
the
sad
story
had
been
brought
to
an
end
and
i
was
of
the
same
opinion
there
are
several
forms
of
mutiny
and
some
of
them
are
called
by
other
names
but
all
as
dangerous
as
they
are
wicked
because
many
of
those
who
badgered
the
brave
old
soldier
to
his
death
paid
the
full
penalty
of
their
crime
in
the
ravine
under
the
hatchet
or
knife
of
the
savages
it
may
not
be
well
to
say
harsh
words
concerning
them
but
so
long
as
i
live
there
will
always
be
anger
in
my
heart
whenever
i
hear
their
names
mentioned
during
that
evening
after
everything
had
been
made
ready
for
the
march
at
an
early
hour
next
morning
we
lads
gave
to
peter
sitz
messages
for
the
loved
ones
at
cherry
valley
promising
that
we
would
never
bring
disgrace
upon
the
settlement
and
so
burdening
his
mind
with
this
matter
and
the
other
that
if
the
poor
man
remembered
but
the
half
of
all
the
words
we
entrusted
him
with
he
must
have
had
a
most
prodigious
memory
right
proud
was
i
when
i
marched
out
of
the
fort
next
morning
at
the
head
of
my
company
followed
by
the
two
but
yet
there
was
a
sorrow
in
my
heart
because
it
seemed
in
a
certain
degree
at
least
as
if
by
becoming
regularly
enlisted
men
we
gave
up
our
claim
to
the
name
of
minute
boys
of
the
mohawk
valley
those
under
whom
we
served
did
not
view
the
matter
in
the
same
light
i
did
however
for
we
kept
the
title
we
liked
best
during
all
the
time
we
served
in
the
army
it
would
please
me
to
set
down
here
an
account
of
the
adventures
which
were
ours
after
becoming
enlisted
men
but
it
must
not
be
done
else
i
might
never
bring
the
tale
to
a
close
for
we
saw
very
much
during
the
time
our
people
were
convincing
the
king
and
surely
did
our
duty
at
bemis
heights
otherwise
our
company
would
never
have
been
mentioned
in
the
flattering
terms
it
then
was
it
causes
me
most
profound
sorrow
to
say
that
our
company
was
far
away
fighting
for
the
cause
to
the
best
of
our
ability
when
our
homes
at
cherry
valley
were
destroyed
and
many
of
our
loved
ones
massacred
by
the
fiendish
savages
and
there
is
always
in
my
heart
a
cruel
joy
that
we
lads
who
had
been
trained
by
sergeant
corney
avenged
that
dastardly
act
of
thayendanega
in
such
manly
fashion
that
he
must
have
remembered
the
reprisals
to
his
dying
day
then
it
was
we
showed
ourselves
to
be
minute
boys
of
the
mohawk
valley
in
good
truth
however
we
may
have
been
spoken
of
elsewhere
and
if
it
so
be
the
good
god
spares
my
life
sufficiently
long
i
propose
to
set
down
the
story
of
that
vengeance
when
more
than
one
of
us
sorely
wounded
continued
the
chase
upheld
even
when
exhausted
nigh
unto
death
by
the
thoughts
of
what
our
loved
ones
had
been
made
to
suffer
by
that
wolf
in
human
shape
