speaking
of

said
gladys
evans
what
do
you
think
of
this
for
one
she
spread
out
a
bead
band
about
an
inch
and
a
half
wide
and
a
yard
or
more
long
in
which
she
had
worked
out
in
colors
the
main
events
of
her
summer
camping
trip
with
the
winnebago
camp
fire
girls
the
girls
dropped
their
hand
work
and
crowded
around
gladys
to
get
a
better
look
at
the
band
which
told
so
cleverly
the
story
of
their
wonderful
summer
oh
look
cried
sahwah
brewster
excitedly
pointing
out
the
figures
there
shadow
river
and
the
canoe
floating
upside
down
and
ed
roberts
serenading
gladys
only
it
turned
out
to
be
sherry
serenading
nyoda
and
the
hike
and
the
fourth
of
july
pageant
and
everything
the
winnebagos
were
loud
in
their
expressions
of
admiration
and
the
you
remembers
fell
thick
and
fast
as
they
recalled
the
events
depicted
in
the
bead
band
it
was
a
crisp
evening
in
october
and
the
winnebagos
were
having
their
work
meeting
at
the
bradford
house
as
the
guests
of
dorothy
bradford
or
hinpoha
as
she
was
known
in
the
winnebago
circle
here
were
all
the
girls
we
left
standing
on
the
boat
dock
at
loon
lake
looking
just
the
same
as
when
we
saw
them
last
a
trifle
less
sunburned
perhaps
but
just
as
full
of
life
and
spirit
scissors
needles
and
crochet
hooks
flew
fast
as
the
seven
girls
and
their
guardian
sat
around
the
cheerful
wood
fire
in
the
library
sahwah
was
tatting
gladys
and
migwan
were
embroidering
and
miss
kent
familiarly
known
as
nyoda
the
guardian
of
the
winnebago
group
was
mending
her
hose
as
she
laughingly
expressed
it
the
three
more
quiet
girls
in
the
circle
nakwisi
the
star
maiden
chapa
the
chipmunk
and
medmangi
the
medicine
man
girl
were
working
out
their
various
symbols
in
crochet
patterns
hinpoha
was
down
on
the
floor
popping
corn
over
the
glowing
logs
and
turning
over
a
row
of
apples
which
had
been
set
before
the
fireplace
to
warm
the
firelight
streaming
over
her
red
curls
made
them
shine
like
burning
embers
until
it
seemed
as
if
some
of
the
fire
had
escaped
from
the
grate
and
was
playing
around
her
face
every
few
minutes
she
reached
out
her
hand
and
dealt
a
gentle
slap
on
the
nose
of
bob
a
young
cocker
spaniel
attached
to
the
house
of
bradford
who
persistently
tried
to
take
the
apples
in
his
mouth
nyoda
finally
came
to
the
rescue
and
diverted
his
attention
by
giving
him
her
darning
egg
to
chew
the
room
was
filled
with
the
chatter
of
the
girls
sahwah
was
relating
with
many
giggles
how
she
had
gotten
into
a
scrape
at
school
and
old
professor
fuzzytop
made
me
bring
all
my
books
and
sit
up
at
that
little
table
beside
his
desk
for
a
week
of
course
i
did
mind
that
a
bit
because
then
i
could
see
what
in
the
room
was
doing
instead
of
just
the
few
around
me
the
only
thing
i
prayed
for
was
that
miss
muggins
would
come
in
and
see
me
because
she
has
taken
a
sort
of
fancy
to
me
and
makes
it
easy
for
me
in
latin
but
if
i
ever
fall
from
grace
she
wo
pass
me
but
of
all
the
luck
right
in
the
middle
of
the
fourth
hour
when
everybody
was
in
the
room
studying
in
she
walked
i
saw
her
as
she
opened
the
door
and
quick
as
a
wink
i
opened
up
the
big
dictionary
on
the
table
and
buried
my
nose
in
it
so
she
think
i
had
gone
up
there
of
my
own
accord
she
stopped
and
looked
at
me
then
patted
me
encouragingly
on
the
shoulder
and
remarked
what
a
studious
girl
i
was
i
thought
everybody
in
the
room
would
die
trying
not
to
laugh
but
nobody
gave
me
away
she
came
in
during
the
fourth
hour
for
several
days
after
that
and
every
time
i
flew
to
the
sheltering
arms
of
the
dictionary
and
she
always
made
some
approving
remark
out
loud
now
she
thinks
i
a
shark
and
i
have
a
better
than
ever
with
her
she
told
her
senior
session
room
that
there
was
a
girl
in
the
junior
room
who
was
so
keen
after
knowledge
that
no
matter
when
she
came
into
the
room
she
always
found
her
consulting
the
dictionary
sahwah
imitation
of
the
elderly
and
precise
miss
muggins
was
so
close
that
the
girls
shrieked
with
laughter
even
nyoda
who
was
a
faculty
and
should
have
been
the
ally
of
the
deluded
instructor
was
too
much
amused
to
say
a
word
by
the
way
sahwah
she
said
when
the
laughter
had
died
down
how
are
you
coming
on
in
latin
the
last
time
i
saw
you
your
cicero
had
a
strangle
hold
on
you
sahwah
made
a
fearful
grimace
and
recited
sarcastically
not
showers
to
larks
more
pleasing
not
sunshine
to
the
bee
not
sleep
to
toil
more
easing
than
latin
prose
to
me
the
flocks
shall
leave
the
mountains
the
dew
shall
flee
the
rose
the
nymphs
forsake
the
fountains
ere
i
forsake
my
prose
nyoda
laughed
and
shook
her
head
at
sahwah
and
migwan
otherwise
elsie
gardiner
looked
up
at
the
despiser
of
prose
composition
in
mild
wonderment
i
do
see
how
you
can
make
such
a
fuss
about
learning
latin
she
said
it
the
least
of
my
troubles
but
i
not
such
a
genius
as
you
answered
sahwah
and
my
head
stand
the
strain
her
mental
limitations
did
not
seem
to
cause
her
any
anxiety
however
for
she
hummed
a
merry
tune
as
she
drew
her
tatting
shuttle
in
and
out
migwan
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
looked
around
the
tastefully
furnished
room
with
quiet
enjoyment
this
library
in
the
bradford
house
was
a
delight
to
her
it
was
finished
in
dark
oak
and
the
walls
were
hung
with
a
rich
brown
paper
the
floor
was
polished
and
covered
with
oriental
rugs
whose
patterns
she
loved
to
trace
at
one
end
of
the
room
was
a
big
fireplace
and
on
each
side
of
it
a
cozy
seat
piled
with
tapestry
covered
cushions
over
the
fireplace
hung
two
slender
swords
the
property
of
some
departed
bradford
the
handsome
chairs
were
upholstered
in
brown
leather
to
match
the
other
furnishings
and
everything
in
the
room
from
the
italian
marble
psyche
on
its
pedestal
in
the
corner
to
the
softly
glowing
lamps
gave
the
impression
of
wealth
and
culture
migwan
contrasted
it
with
the
shabby
sitting
room
in
her
own
home
and
sighed
she
was
keenly
responsive
to
beautiful
surroundings
and
would
have
been
happy
to
stay
forever
in
this
library
but
beautiful
as
the
furnishings
were
they
were
the
least
part
of
the
attraction
the
real
drawing
card
were
the
books
that
filled
the
cases
on
three
sides
of
the
room
there
were
books
of
every
kind
fiction
poetry
history
travel
science
and
whole
sets
of
books
in
handsome
bindings
that
migwan
fairly
revelled
in
whenever
she
came
to
visit
hinpoha
herself
was
not
fond
of
reading
anything
but
fiction
and
although
she
had
the
freedom
of
all
the
cases
she
never
looked
at
anything
but
story
books
before
her
parents
went
to
europe
they
had
tried
making
her
keep
an
average
of
one
book
of
fiction
to
one
of
another
kind
in
the
hope
of
instilling
into
her
a
love
for
essays
and
history
but
in
the
absence
of
her
father
and
mother
history
and
essays
were
having
a
long
vacation
and
fiction
was
working
overtime
let
play
something
said
sahwah
when
the
apples
and
popcorn
had
disappeared
i
tired
of
sitting
still
ca
somebody
please
think
of
a
new
game
said
hinpoha
we
played
everything
we
know
until
i
sick
of
it
i
thought
of
one
the
other
day
said
gladys
quietly
i
named
it
the
fire
game
you
play
it
like
stage
coach
or
fruit
basket
only
instead
of
taking
parts
of
a
coach
or
names
of
fruits
you
take
articles
that
belong
to
the
camp
fire
like
bead
band
ring
moccasin
bracelet
fire
honor
beads
symbol
fringe
wohelo
hand
sign
bow
and
drill
mystic
fire
etc
then
somebody
tells
a
story
about
camp
fire
girls
and
every
time
one
of
those
articles
is
mentioned
every
one
must
get
up
and
turn
around
but
if
the
words
meeting
or
fire
are
mentioned
then
all
must
change
seats
and
the
story
teller
tries
to
get
a
seat
in
the
scramble
and
the
one
who
gets
left
out
has
to
go
on
with
the
story
good
cried
nyoda
let
play
it
you
tell
the
story
first
gladys
stood
up
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
began
once
upon
a
time
there
were
a
group
of
camp
fire
girls
called
the
winnebagos
and
they
went
to
school
in
the
professors
big
tepee
on
the
avenue
where
they
pursued
knowledge
for
all
they
were
worth
so
much
wisdom
did
they
imbibe
that
it
was
necessary
to
wear
a
head
band
to
keep
their
heads
from
splitting
open
wherever
they
went
they
were
immediately
recognized
by
their
rings
and
bracelets
and
were
pointed
out
as
dreadful
young
savages
the
professors
and
teachers
hoped
every
day
that
they
would
not
come
to
school
but
they
never
stayed
away
because
they
received
honor
beads
from
their
guardian
mother
for
not
being
absent
sometimes
it
seemed
as
if
the
tricks
they
did
in
class
room
could
only
have
been
accomplished
by
their
having
consulted
one
another
and
yet
it
was
impossible
to
catch
them
whispering
in
class
because
they
always
conversed
by
hand
signs
however
this
also
led
to
disaster
one
day
when
one
of
our
sisters
of
the
bow
and
drill
tried
to
make
the
hand
sign
for
and
raised
her
hand
above
her
head
the
big
chief
who
was
conducting
the
lesson
thought
she
wanted
something
and
said
benevolently
is
your
desire
she
replied
is
my
desire
to
become
a
camp
fire
girl
and
obey
the
law
of
the
camp
fire
which
is
to
seek
beauty
give
service
pursue
knowledge
be
trustworthy
hold
on
to
health
glorify
work
and
be
happy
said
the
big
chief
do
you
think
this
is
a
ceremonial
meeting
at
the
words
ceremonial
meeting
all
the
girls
jumped
up
to
change
places
and
in
the
scramble
a
vase
was
knocked
off
the
table
and
broken
every
one
sat
rooted
to
the
spot
with
fright
all
except
bob
who
fled
at
the
sound
of
the
crash
as
if
he
had
been
the
guilty
one
hinpoha
calmly
collected
the
pieces
and
carried
them
out
my
mother
will
be
extremely
grateful
to
you
for
this
when
she
comes
home
she
said
if
there
was
one
vase
in
the
house
she
hated
it
was
this
one
my
aunt
phoebe
brought
it
from
the
world
fair
in
chicago
and
thinks
it
the
chief
ornament
of
our
home
wo
mother
be
glad
when
she
finds
it
broken
and
she
can
prove
that
none
of
us
did
it
the
tension
relaxed
and
the
girls
breathed
easily
again
when
are
your
mother
and
father
coming
home
asked
nyoda
they
sailed
last
week
on
the
answered
hinpoha
were
you
worried
to
death
to
have
them
in
europe
so
long
with
the
war
going
on
asked
migwan
no
not
much
said
hinpoha
because
they
have
been
in
switzerland
all
the
while
which
is
safe
enough
and
as
they
are
coming
home
on
a
neutral
vessel
they
have
had
no
trouble
getting
passage
they
should
be
here
in
a
week
and
hinpoha
eyes
shone
with
a
great
glad
light
for
although
she
had
been
having
the
jolliest
time
imaginable
doing
as
she
pleased
in
the
house
which
was
in
the
care
of
aunt
grace
who
never
cared
a
bit
what
hinpoha
did
so
long
as
it
did
not
bother
her
she
missed
her
mother
sorely
and
could
hardly
wait
until
she
returned
nyoda
saw
the
transfigured
look
that
came
into
her
eyes
when
she
spoke
of
her
mother
home
coming
and
her
own
eyes
went
dim
for
her
mother
had
died
when
she
was
just
hinpoha
age
after
the
breaking
of
the
vase
the
game
stopped
and
the
girls
sat
down
again
in
a
quiet
circle
do
you
know
said
nyoda
that
bead
band
gladys
made
has
given
me
an
idea
why
ca
we
keep
a
personal
record
in
bead
work
it
would
be
a
great
deal
more
interesting
and
picturesque
than
keeping
a
diary
and
there
would
be
no
danger
of
your
little
sister
getting
hold
of
it
and
reading
your
secrets
out
loud
to
her
friends
it
a
great
idea
said
migwan
who
had
always
kept
a
diary
and
had
suffered
much
from
an
inquisitive
brother
and
sister
besides
said
sahwah
think
how
exciting
it
would
be
at
ceremonial
meetings
to
sit
with
your
life
story
hanging
around
your
neck
and
know
that
your
neighbor
was
just
breaking
neck
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
little
pictures
meant
would
old
fuzzytop
love
to
be
able
to
read
mine
though
and
sahwah
giggled
extravagantly
as
she
saw
in
her
mind
eye
the
bead
record
of
some
of
her
activities
in
the
junior
session
room
now
about
all
our
activities
continued
nyoda
are
covered
by
the
seven
points
of
the
camp
fire
law
so
that
everything
we
do
either
fulfills
or
breaks
the
law
what
do
you
say
if
we
register
our
commendable
doings
in
colors
but
record
the
event
in
black
every
time
we
break
the
law
the
girls
thought
this
would
be
a
fascinating
game
and
sahwah
remarked
that
she
must
send
to
the
outfitting
company
for
a
bunch
of
black
beads
directly
as
she
had
only
a
very
few
left
it
a
good
thing
we
did
keep
this
record
last
summer
said
gladys
with
a
thoughtful
look
in
her
eyes
or
mine
would
have
been
black
from
one
end
to
the
other
it
would
either
said
sahwah
vehemently
you
did
more
for
us
in
the
end
than
we
ever
did
for
you
and
my
sins
were
as
scarlet
as
yours
every
bit
since
that
terrible
day
in
camp
gladys
seemed
to
have
been
made
over
and
never
once
reverted
to
her
old
selfishness
and
superciliousness
so
that
she
now
had
the
love
and
esteem
of
every
one
of
the
winnebagos
all
mention
of
her
old
was
quickly
silenced
by
sahwah
who
now
adored
her
heart
and
soul
gladys
entrance
into
the
public
school
after
two
years
at
miss
russell
had
caused
quite
a
stir
among
the
girls
of
the
neighborhood
who
in
times
past
had
been
wont
to
consider
her
proud
and
haughty
but
her
simple
unaffected
manner
quickly
won
for
her
a
secure
place
in
the
affections
of
all
teachers
and
scholars
alike
loved
her
sahwah
was
still
counting
up
her
own
misdemeanors
at
camp
when
the
evans
automobile
came
for
gladys
and
reluctantly
all
the
girls
prepared
to
go
home
it
always
seemed
harder
to
break
away
from
hinpoha
house
than
from
any
of
the
others
in
spite
of
the
rich
furnishings
it
had
a
cozy
homey
atmosphere
of
being
used
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
no
guest
however
humble
ever
felt
awkward
or
out
of
place
there
thus
it
usually
happens
that
when
people
are
entirely
at
ease
in
their
own
surroundings
they
soon
make
others
feel
the
same
way
too
chapter
ii
a
sudden
misfortune
as
the
day
drew
near
for
the
return
of
her
mother
and
father
hinpoha
went
all
over
the
house
from
garret
to
cellar
seeing
that
everything
was
put
to
rights
she
and
the
other
winnebagos
took
a
trip
into
the
country
for
bittersweet
to
decorate
the
fireplace
in
the
library
and
in
her
father
study
upstairs
with
pardonable
pride
she
arranged
a
little
exhibition
of
the
craft
work
she
had
done
in
camp
and
the
sketches
she
had
made
of
the
lake
and
hills
on
the
table
in
her
mother
room
she
placed
a
work
basket
she
had
made
of
reed
and
lined
with
silk
gracious
sakes
child
said
her
aunt
from
her
rocking
chair
by
the
front
window
of
the
what
a
fuss
you
are
going
to
one
would
think
it
was
your
aunt
phoebe
who
was
coming
instead
of
your
mother
and
father
they
be
just
as
glad
to
see
you
if
the
house
as
neat
as
a
pin
from
top
to
bottom
and
aunt
grace
resumed
her
rocking
and
her
novel
as
unconcerned
about
the
imminent
return
of
the
travelers
as
if
it
were
nothing
more
than
the
daily
visit
of
the
milkman
nothing
short
of
an
earthquake
would
ever
shake
aunt
grace
out
of
her
settled
complacency
hinpoha
went
happily
on
seeing
that
every
tack
and
screw
was
in
place
and
arranging
the
books
in
the
cases
to
correspond
to
her
catalog
for
they
had
become
sadly
mixed
during
his
absence
she
even
took
out
a
volume
of
his
favorite
essays
and
pored
over
them
diligently
so
that
she
might
discuss
them
with
him
and
show
that
she
had
used
some
of
her
time
to
good
advantage
she
straightened
out
her
bureau
drawers
and
mended
all
her
clothes
and
stockings
when
everything
was
in
order
she
viewed
the
result
with
a
happy
feeling
at
the
pleasure
it
would
give
her
mother
when
she
saw
it
hinpoha
most
prominent
trait
in
times
past
had
not
been
neatness
nyoda
who
had
been
called
in
to
make
a
final
inspection
before
hinpoha
was
satisfied
wondered
if
all
the
girls
were
seeking
beauty
as
earnestly
as
hinpoha
was
she
envied
hinpoha
the
homecoming
of
her
mother
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
this
feeling
was
particularly
strong
one
afternoon
as
she
sat
in
the
school
room
after
the
close
of
school
looking
over
some
english
papers
it
was
the
anniversary
of
the
death
of
her
mother
and
she
sat
recalling
little
incidents
of
her
childhood
before
this
best
of
chums
had
been
taken
away
as
she
sat
there
half
dreaming
she
heard
voices
in
the
hall
before
her
door
have
you
heard
the
latest
asked
one
voice
no
said
the
second
voice
what
is
it
why
the
has
gone
down
answered
the
first
voice
struck
a
mine
in
the
ocean
at
the
word
francona
nyoda
started
up
that
was
the
boat
parents
were
coming
on
she
hurried
out
into
the
hall
after
the
two
teachers
what
did
you
say
about
the
she
asked
they
handed
her
the
extra
they
had
been
reading
and
she
saw
with
her
own
eyes
the
account
of
the
disaster
the
list
of
saved
was
pitifully
small
and
hinpoha
parents
were
not
among
them
soon
she
came
to
the
notation
among
the
lost
are
and
adam
bradford
prominent
cleveland
lawyer
and
his
wife
bradford
was
the
son
of
the
late
judge
bradford
and
a
man
about
town
of
what
little
avail
is
prominence
when
calamity
stretches
out
her
cruel
hands
well
known
and
obscure
gave
up
their
lives
together
and
found
a
grave
side
by
side
you
look
like
a
ghost
miss
kent
said
one
of
the
teachers
any
friends
of
yours
on
board
dorothy
bradford
mother
and
father
answered
nyoda
one
of
the
pupils
here
at
school
leaving
her
work
unfinished
she
hastened
to
hinpoha
house
the
news
had
just
been
learned
there
aunt
grace
had
fainted
and
was
being
revived
with
salts
hinpoha
flung
herself
on
nyoda
and
clung
to
her
like
a
drowning
person
between
neighbors
and
friends
coming
to
sympathize
and
reporters
from
the
newspapers
seeking
interviews
the
house
was
a
pandemonium
nyoda
saw
that
hinpoha
would
never
quiet
down
in
those
surroundings
and
took
her
away
to
her
own
apartment
of
all
the
friends
who
offered
consolation
nyoda
was
the
one
to
whom
hinpoha
turned
for
comfort
here
the
brilliant
young
college
woman
and
the
simple
girl
were
on
a
level
for
they
shared
a
common
experience
and
each
could
comprehend
the
other
sorrow
poor
hinpoha
she
had
need
of
all
the
consolation
that
nyoda
could
give
her
in
the
days
that
followed
full
of
bitterness
as
her
cup
was
there
was
to
be
added
yet
one
more
drop
the
drop
that
caused
it
to
run
over
aunt
phoebe
came
to
live
with
her
and
be
the
mistress
of
the
bradford
house
at
some
time
in
the
past
judge
bradford
and
his
sister
phoebe
had
been
named
joint
guardians
of
hinpoha
but
the
judge
was
now
dead
and
aunt
phoebe
was
the
sole
guardian
aunt
phoebe
was
a
spinster
of
the
type
usually
described
in
books
tall
and
spare
with
steely
blue
eyes
she
was
sixty
years
old
but
she
might
have
been
a
hundred
and
sixty
for
all
the
sympathy
she
had
with
youth
she
had
been
disappointed
in
love
when
she
was
twenty
and
had
never
thought
kindly
of
any
man
since
from
her
earliest
childhood
hinpoha
had
dreaded
the
very
name
of
aunt
phoebe
when
she
came
to
visit
a
restraint
fell
over
the
whole
house
the
usual
lively
chatter
at
the
dinner
table
was
hushed
and
aunt
phoebe
held
forth
in
solemn
tones
generally
berating
some
unfortunate
person
who
nearly
always
happened
to
be
a
good
friend
of
bradford
hinpoha
would
be
called
up
for
a
minute
examination
of
her
clothes
and
manners
and
would
invariably
do
something
which
was
not
right
in
her
great
aunt
eyes
she
had
a
vivid
recollection
of
going
tobogganing
down
the
long
front
walk
one
winter
day
her
jolly
mother
on
the
sled
with
her
steering
it
adroitly
around
the
corner
and
up
the
sidewalk
for
a
distance
after
leaving
the
slope
such
fun
they
were
having
that
they
did
not
look
to
see
if
the
road
was
clear
and
went
bumping
into
a
female
figure
that
was
coming
majestically
along
the
street
knocking
her
off
her
feet
and
into
a
snowdrift
it
was
aunt
phoebe
coming
to
make
a
formal
afternoon
call
she
sat
bolt
upright
in
the
snow
and
adjusted
her
lorgnette
to
see
if
by
any
chance
her
grandniece
could
be
one
of
those
rowdy
children
when
she
discovered
that
it
was
not
only
hinpoha
but
her
mother
as
well
frolicking
so
indecorously
she
was
speechless
bradford
started
to
make
an
abject
apology
but
the
sight
of
aunt
phoebe
sitting
in
the
snowdrift
with
her
lorgnette
was
too
much
for
her
and
she
went
off
into
a
peal
of
laughter
in
which
hinpoha
joined
gleefully
it
was
weeks
before
aunt
phoebe
could
be
coaxed
to
make
another
visit
and
this
was
the
woman
who
was
coming
to
take
the
place
of
hinpoha
beloved
mother
aunt
grace
left
the
day
she
came
there
was
not
enough
room
in
one
house
for
her
and
aunt
phoebe
with
aunt
phoebe
came
silky
a
wiggling
snapping
skye
terrier
he
gave
one
glance
at
genial
bob
who
was
rolling
on
his
back
before
the
fireplace
and
with
a
growl
fastened
his
teeth
into
his
neck
hinpoha
rescued
her
pet
and
bore
him
away
to
her
room
where
she
shed
tears
of
despair
while
he
licked
her
hand
sympathetically
aunt
phoebe
first
act
was
to
put
hinpoha
into
deep
mourning
hinpoha
objected
strenuously
but
there
was
no
help
and
she
went
to
school
swathed
from
head
to
foot
in
black
nyoda
was
wrathful
at
the
sight
for
if
there
was
one
point
she
felt
strongly
about
it
was
putting
children
into
mourning
among
the
gaily
dressed
girls
hinpoha
stood
out
like
some
dark
spirit
from
the
underworld
casting
a
gloom
wherever
she
went
where
is
that
beautiful
vase
i
brought
your
mother
from
the
fair
asked
aunt
phoebe
one
day
suddenly
missing
it
it
was
accidently
broken
at
our
last
camp
fire
meeting
answered
hinpoha
with
a
tightening
around
her
heart
when
she
thought
of
that
last
happy
gathering
camp
fire
said
aunt
phoebe
with
a
snort
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
are
mixed
up
in
any
such
foolishness
as
that
i
certainly
am
said
hinpoha
energetically
and
it
is
foolishness
either
i
learned
more
since
i
have
been
a
camp
fire
girl
than
i
did
in
all
the
years
before
well
you
may
consider
yourself
graduated
then
said
aunt
phoebe
drily
for
i
have
no
such
nonsense
about
me
i
can
teach
you
all
you
need
to
know
outside
of
what
you
learn
in
school
camp
fire
always
had
mother
fullest
approval
said
hinpoha
darkly
i
dare
say
returned
her
aunt
but
i
want
you
to
understand
once
for
all
that
i
wo
have
any
girls
holding
here
to
upset
the
house
and
break
valuable
ornaments
but
you
do
care
if
i
go
to
them
at
other
girls
houses
do
you
asked
hinpoha
the
fear
gripping
her
that
she
was
to
be
denied
the
consolation
of
these
weekly
gatherings
with
the
winnebagos
i
do
want
you
to
have
anything
to
do
with
that
camp
fire
business
said
aunt
phoebe
in
a
tone
of
finality
and
hinpoha
left
the
room
her
heart
swelling
with
bitterness
she
was
too
wise
to
argue
the
point
with
aunt
phoebe
and
resolved
to
depend
on
nyoda
to
show
her
the
way
she
dried
her
tears
and
went
down
to
the
living
room
and
began
to
play
softly
on
the
piano
it
had
been
her
mother
piano
the
wedding
gift
of
her
father
and
it
seemed
that
her
mother
spirit
hovered
over
it
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
touched
the
keys
since
that
awful
wednesday
when
the
world
had
been
turned
into
chaos
she
had
had
no
heart
to
play
but
the
sound
of
the
music
comforted
her
and
her
bitter
resentment
against
her
aunt
lost
some
of
its
sting
she
played
on
lost
in
memories
when
suddenly
the
sharp
voice
of
her
aunt
brought
her
back
to
earth
what
does
this
mean
cried
aunt
phoebe
playing
on
the
piano
when
your
father
and
mother
have
just
died
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
come
away
immediately
and
do
open
that
piano
again
until
our
period
of
mourning
is
over
she
closed
the
piano
and
locked
it
putting
the
key
into
her
bag
under
aunt
phoebe
management
the
house
soon
lost
its
look
of
inviting
friendliness
the
blinds
were
always
kept
drawn
so
that
even
on
the
brightest
days
the
rooms
had
a
gloomy
appearance
no
more
cheerful
wood
fires
crackled
and
glowed
in
the
grate
they
made
ashes
on
the
rugs
and
were
extravagant
as
the
house
was
heated
by
steam
the
bookcases
were
locked
and
hinpoha
was
forbidden
to
read
fiction
as
this
was
not
proper
when
one
was
in
mourning
you
will
become
acquainted
with
much
pleasant
literature
reading
to
me
while
i
crochet
she
said
when
hinpoha
rose
in
revolt
at
this
edict
the
pleasant
literature
which
aunt
phoebe
was
just
then
perusing
was
a
history
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
eleven
volumes
which
bored
hinpoha
so
it
nearly
gagged
her
besides
aunt
phoebe
constantly
found
fault
with
hinpoha
manner
of
reading
it
was
either
too
loud
or
not
loud
enough
either
too
fast
or
too
slow
but
it
was
never
right
that
reading
aloud
was
the
last
straw
to
hinpoha
after
sitting
still
a
whole
afternoon
getting
her
school
lessons
she
longed
to
move
about
after
supper
but
then
aunt
phoebe
expected
her
to
sit
still
the
entire
evening
and
entertain
her
with
the
activities
of
the
early
presbytery
after
nearly
a
week
of
this
deadly
dullness
hinpoha
was
ready
to
fly
and
yet
aunt
phoebe
was
not
conscious
that
there
was
anything
wrong
in
the
way
she
was
treating
hinpoha
she
cared
for
her
in
her
frozen
way
she
was
merely
trying
to
bring
her
up
in
the
way
she
herself
had
been
brought
up
by
a
maiden
aunt
not
taking
into
account
that
this
was
another
day
and
age
in
her
time
it
was
considered
the
proper
thing
to
shut
down
on
all
lightheartedness
after
a
death
in
the
family
and
she
was
adhering
steadfastly
to
the
old
principles
she
was
yet
to
learn
that
she
could
not
force
obsolete
customs
upon
a
girl
who
had
lived
for
sixteen
years
in
the
sunlight
of
modern
ideas
all
hinpoha
troubles
were
confided
to
nyoda
who
sympathized
with
her
entirely
but
bade
her
be
of
good
cheer
and
hope
for
the
time
when
aunt
phoebe
would
see
for
herself
that
the
new
way
was
best
and
above
all
to
win
the
respect
and
liking
of
her
aunt
the
first
thing
as
more
could
be
accomplished
in
this
way
than
by
being
antagonistic
i
do
suppose
you
could
go
for
a
long
walk
with
me
sunday
afternoon
said
nyoda
hinpoha
shook
her
head
sadly
we
do
do
anything
like
that
on
sunday
she
answered
with
resentment
flaming
in
her
eye
we
go
to
church
morning
and
evening
and
in
the
afternoon
i
am
supposed
to
read
the
bible
or
a
book
by
a
man
named
thomas
à
kempis
nyoda
turned
her
eyes
inward
with
such
a
comical
expression
that
hinpoha
forgot
her
troubles
for
a
moment
and
laughed
the
bible
and
thomas
à
kempis
said
nyoda
musingly
where
did
i
hear
those
two
mentioned
before
oh
i
have
it
did
you
ever
read
this
anywhere
to
memory
one
hundred
verses
of
the
bible
or
an
equal
amount
of
sacred
literature
such
as
thomas
à
kempis
hinpoha
hung
her
head
still
smiling
why
nyoda
she
said
there
a
chance
to
earn
an
honor
bead
that
i
probably
would
have
thought
of
otherwise
said
nyoda
an
ill
wind
you
know
and
while
you
are
doing
so
much
bible
reading
you
will
undoubtedly
come
across
something
about
the
wilderness
a
cedar
and
will
learn
that
most
waste
places
can
be
turned
into
blooming
gardens
if
we
only
know
how
thank
you
said
hinpoha
i
always
feel
less
forlorn
after
a
talk
with
you
her
face
brightened
but
immediately
fell
again
but
what
good
will
it
do
me
to
work
for
honors
she
said
sadly
aunt
phoebe
let
me
come
to
the
meetings
wo
she
really
asked
nyoda
in
surprise
hinpoha
nodded
near
to
tears
i
must
see
about
that
said
nyoda
resolutely
i
think
if
i
explain
the
mission
and
activities
of
camp
fire
she
will
not
object
to
your
belonging
she
probably
has
a
wrong
idea
of
what
it
means
accordingly
nyoda
came
on
aunt
phoebe
that
very
night
in
addition
to
being
very
pretty
nyoda
had
a
great
deal
of
dignity
and
when
she
put
on
her
formal
manner
she
looked
very
impressive
indeed
she
did
not
act
as
if
she
had
come
to
see
hinpoha
at
all
but
asked
for
miss
bradford
and
said
she
had
come
to
pay
her
respects
to
her
new
neighbor
she
listened
politely
to
aunt
phoebe
account
of
her
last
siege
of
rheumatism
admired
her
crochet
work
and
hoped
she
liked
this
street
as
well
as
her
former
neighborhood
she
said
she
had
often
seen
miss
bradford
name
in
the
papers
in
connection
with
various
charitable
organizations
and
was
very
glad
to
have
the
honor
of
meeting
the
sister
of
the
prominent
judge
aunt
phoebe
was
pleased
and
flattered
at
the
deference
paid
her
but
when
nyoda
announced
herself
as
the
leader
of
the
club
to
which
hinpoha
belonged
and
asked
permission
for
her
to
attend
the
meetings
she
refused
she
was
perfectly
polite
about
it
and
did
not
mention
her
antipathy
to
camp
fire
and
taking
refuge
behind
her
favorite
excuse
that
of
being
in
mourning
stated
that
she
did
not
wish
hinpoha
to
go
out
in
society
but
this
is
broke
in
hinpoha
desperately
a
meeting
of
a
club
partakes
of
a
social
nature
returned
her
aunt
and
is
not
to
be
thought
of
and
there
the
matter
rested
so
nyoda
had
to
depart
without
accomplishing
her
mission
hinpoha
utterly
crushed
followed
her
to
the
door
and
nyoda
gave
her
hand
a
reassuring
squeeze
do
despair
dear
she
whispered
hopefully
she
will
come
around
to
it
eventually
but
it
will
take
time
be
patient
and
in
the
meantime
read
this
and
she
slipped
into
her
hand
a
tiny
copy
of
the
desert
of
waiting
just
be
true
to
the
law
and
see
if
you
can
not
find
the
roses
among
the
thorns
and
from
them
distil
the
precious
ointment
that
will
open
the
door
of
the
city
of
your
desire
later
on
hinpoha
thrust
the
little
book
into
her
blouse
and
when
she
was
safe
in
her
own
room
read
it
from
cover
to
cover
when
she
finished
there
was
a
song
in
her
heart
again
and
a
light
in
her
eyes
resolutely
she
turned
her
face
to
the
east
and
began
her
long
sojourn
in
the
desert
of
waiting
nyoda
pondered
the
problem
for
a
long
while
that
night
and
the
next
day
she
went
to
call
on
gladys
mother
evans
had
taken
a
great
liking
to
the
popular
young
teacher
of
whom
gladys
was
so
fond
and
cordially
invited
her
to
spend
as
much
time
as
she
could
at
the
house
with
the
family
it
was
to
her
then
that
nyoda
appealed
for
advice
in
regard
to
hinpoha
evans
made
a
slight
grimace
when
the
facts
were
laid
before
her
if
that
is
just
like
phoebe
bradford
she
exclaimed
indignantly
trying
to
shut
up
that
poor
girl
like
a
nun
to
conform
to
some
ideas
of
hers
if
the
judge
were
alive
that
house
look
as
if
there
was
a
perpetual
funeral
going
on
i
certainly
will
call
and
see
if
i
can
do
anything
to
change
her
mind
although
i
doubt
very
much
if
that
could
be
accomplished
by
human
means
the
next
day
aunt
phoebe
was
agreeably
surprised
to
receive
a
call
from
evans
all
the
best
people
in
the
neighborhood
are
making
haste
to
call
on
the
sister
of
judge
bradford
she
reflected
complacently
evans
made
herself
very
agreeable
speaking
of
many
friends
they
had
in
common
and
finally
led
the
conversation
around
to
hinpoha
the
child
looks
very
pale
she
said
i
presume
the
death
of
her
parents
was
a
terrible
shock
to
her
aunt
phoebe
dabbed
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
the
hand
of
misfortune
has
fallen
heavily
upon
this
house
she
said
mournfully
it
has
indeed
thought
evans
aloud
she
said
you
must
not
let
the
girl
grieve
herself
sick
cheerful
company
is
what
she
needs
at
this
time
make
her
go
out
with
the
camp
fire
girls
as
much
as
possible
aunt
phoebe
drew
herself
up
rather
stiffly
i
do
not
approve
of
the
camp
fire
girls
she
said
not
approve
of
the
camp
fire
girls
echoed
evans
in
astonishment
why
what
wrong
with
them
just
what
the
great
objection
was
aunt
phoebe
was
not
prepared
to
say
but
she
remarked
that
such
nonsense
had
never
been
thought
of
in
her
day
and
of
course
she
added
hiding
behind
her
usual
argument
while
we
are
in
mourning
my
grandniece
will
not
go
out
to
any
gatherings
why
i
would
think
of
keeping
gladys
home
for
that
reason
said
evans
seeing
the
subterfuge
she
went
to
a
camp
fire
meeting
the
day
after
her
grandfather
funeral
it
not
like
going
to
a
social
function
you
know
aunt
phoebe
shook
her
head
but
her
policy
of
seclusion
for
hinpoha
was
getting
shaky
homer
evans
was
a
power
in
the
community
and
what
she
did
set
the
fashion
in
a
good
many
directions
aunt
phoebe
was
very
anxious
to
keep
her
as
a
permanent
acquaintance
and
if
evans
gave
her
sanction
to
this
camp
fire
business
she
wondered
if
she
had
not
better
swallow
her
prejudice
outwardly
at
least
for
she
declared
inwardly
that
she
had
never
heard
of
such
foolishness
in
all
her
born
days
when
evans
went
home
aunt
phoebe
had
actually
promised
that
after
three
months
hinpoha
might
attend
the
meetings
as
before
those
three
months
of
mourning
however
were
sacred
to
her
and
on
no
account
would
she
have
consented
to
allow
a
single
ray
of
cheer
to
enter
the
house
during
that
period
chapter
iii
some
trials
of
genius
the
sum
of
the
angles
of
a
triangle
is
equal
to
two
right
angles
migwan
drew
the
construction
lines
as
indicated
in
the
book
and
labored
valiantly
to
understand
why
the
angle
a
was
equal
to
its
alternate
dba
her
brow
puckered
into
a
studious
frown
geometry
was
not
her
long
suit
her
talents
running
to
literature
and
languages
outside
the
october
sun
was
shining
on
the
crimson
and
yellow
maples
making
the
long
street
a
scene
of
dazzling
splendor
the
carpet
of
dry
leaves
on
the
walk
and
sidewalk
tantalized
migwan
with
their
crisp
dryness
she
longed
to
be
out
swishing
and
crackling
through
them
she
sighed
and
stirred
impatiently
in
her
chair
wishing
heartily
that
euclid
had
died
in
his
cradle
i
ca
study
with
all
this
noise
going
on
she
groaned
flinging
her
pencil
and
compass
down
in
despair
indeed
it
would
have
taken
a
much
more
keenly
interested
person
than
migwan
to
have
concentrated
on
a
geometry
lesson
just
then
from
somewhere
upstairs
there
came
an
din
it
sounded
like
an
earthquake
in
a
tin
shop
mingled
with
the
noise
of
the
sky
falling
on
a
glass
roof
and
accompanied
by
the
tramping
of
an
army
a
noise
such
as
could
only
have
been
produced
by
an
extremely
large
elephant
or
an
extremely
small
boy
amusing
himself
indoors
migwan
rose
resolutely
and
mounted
the
stairs
to
the
room
overhead
where
her
brother
and
two
of
his
bosom
friends
were
holding
forth
tom
she
said
appealingly
would
you
and
the
boys
just
as
soon
play
outdoors
or
in
somebody
else
house
i
simply
ca
study
with
all
that
noise
going
on
but
the
others
have
no
punching
bag
said
tom
in
an
injured
tone
and
jim
brought
george
over
especially
to
practice
ca
you
take
the
punching
bag
over
to
jim
suggested
migwan
desperately
sure
said
jim
that
a
good
idea
so
the
boys
unscrewed
the
object
of
attraction
and
departed
with
it
their
pockets
bulging
with
ginger
cookies
which
migwan
gave
them
as
a
reward
for
their
trouble
silence
fell
on
the
house
and
migwan
returned
to
the
mastering
of
the
sum
of
the
angles
geometry
was
the
bane
of
her
existence
and
she
was
only
cheered
into
digging
away
at
it
by
the
thought
of
the
money
lying
in
her
name
in
the
bank
which
she
had
received
for
giving
the
clew
leading
to
little
raymond
bartlett
discovery
the
summer
before
and
which
would
pay
her
way
to
college
for
one
year
at
least
the
theorem
was
learned
at
last
so
that
she
could
make
a
recitation
on
it
even
if
she
did
not
understand
it
perfectly
and
migwan
left
it
to
take
up
a
piece
of
work
which
gave
her
as
much
pleasure
as
the
other
did
pain
this
was
the
writing
of
a
story
which
she
intended
to
send
away
to
a
magazine
she
wrote
it
in
the
back
of
an
old
notebook
and
when
she
was
not
working
at
it
she
kept
it
carefully
in
the
bottom
of
her
shirtwaist
box
where
the
prying
eyes
of
her
younger
sister
would
not
find
it
she
had
all
the
golden
dreams
and
aspirations
of
a
young
authoress
writing
her
first
story
and
her
days
were
filled
with
a
secret
delight
when
she
thought
of
the
riches
that
would
soon
be
hers
when
the
story
was
accepted
as
it
of
course
would
be
if
she
had
known
then
of
the
long
years
of
cruel
disillusionment
that
would
drag
their
weary
length
along
until
her
efforts
were
finally
crowned
with
success
it
is
doubtful
whether
she
would
have
stayed
in
out
of
the
october
sunshine
so
cheerfully
and
worked
with
such
enthusiasm
migwan
family
could
have
used
to
advantage
all
the
gold
which
she
was
dreaming
of
earning
after
her
father
died
her
mother
income
from
various
sources
amounted
to
only
about
dollars
a
month
which
is
not
a
great
amount
when
there
are
three
children
to
keep
in
school
and
it
was
a
struggle
all
the
way
around
to
make
both
ends
meet
gardiner
was
a
poor
manager
and
kept
no
accounts
and
so
took
no
notice
of
the
small
leaks
that
drained
her
purse
from
month
to
month
she
was
fond
of
reading
as
migwan
was
and
sat
up
until
midnight
every
night
burning
gas
then
the
next
morning
she
would
be
too
tired
to
get
up
in
time
to
get
the
children
off
to
school
and
they
would
depart
with
a
hasty
bite
according
to
their
own
fancy
or
without
any
breakfast
at
all
if
they
were
late
she
bought
clothes
when
she
could
have
made
them
herself
at
half
the
cost
and
generally
chose
light
colors
which
soiled
quickly
she
never
went
to
the
store
herself
depending
on
tom
or
betty
her
younger
daughter
to
do
her
marketing
and
in
consequence
paid
the
highest
prices
for
goods
thus
the
dollars
covered
less
ground
every
month
as
prices
mounted
and
little
bills
began
to
be
left
outstanding
part
of
the
income
was
from
a
house
which
rented
for
twenty
dollars
but
this
last
month
the
tenants
had
abruptly
moved
and
that
much
was
cut
off
migwan
as
she
was
began
to
be
worried
about
the
condition
of
their
affairs
and
worked
on
her
story
feverishly
that
it
might
be
turned
into
money
as
soon
as
possible
she
was
deep
in
the
intricacies
of
literary
construction
when
her
mother
entered
the
room
broom
in
hand
and
dust
cap
on
head
and
sank
into
a
chair
do
you
suppose
you
could
finish
this
sweeping
she
asked
migwan
my
back
aches
so
i
just
ca
stand
up
any
longer
why
ca
betty
do
it
asked
migwan
a
little
impatiently
for
she
thought
she
ought
not
be
disturbed
when
she
was
engaged
in
such
an
important
piece
of
work
betty
off
in
the
neighborhood
somewhere
said
her
mother
wearily
did
you
ever
see
her
around
when
there
was
any
work
to
be
done
migwan
was
filled
with
exasperation
that
was
the
way
things
always
went
at
their
house
tom
was
allowed
to
upset
the
place
from
one
end
to
the
other
without
ever
having
to
pick
up
his
things
betty
was
never
asked
to
do
any
housework
and
her
mother
left
the
saturday
dinner
dishes
standing
and
began
to
sweep
in
the
afternoon
and
then
was
unable
to
finish
migwan
was
just
about
to
suggest
a
search
for
the
errant
betty
when
she
remembered
the
give
service
part
of
the
camp
fire
law
she
rose
cheerfully
and
took
the
broom
from
her
mother
hand
lie
down
a
while
mother
she
said
plumping
up
the
pillows
on
the
couch
gardiner
sank
down
gratefully
and
migwan
put
away
her
story
and
went
at
the
sweeping
she
soon
turned
it
into
a
game
in
which
she
was
a
good
fairy
fighting
the
hosts
of
the
goblin
dust
and
must
have
them
completely
vanquished
by
four
or
her
magic
wand
which
had
for
the
time
being
taken
the
shape
of
a
broom
would
vanish
and
leave
her
weaponless
needless
to
say
she
was
in
complete
possession
of
the
field
when
the
clock
struck
the
charmed
hour
being
then
out
of
the
mood
to
continue
her
writing
she
passed
on
into
the
kitchen
and
attacked
the
fortress
of
dishes
which
she
razed
to
the
ground
completely
leaving
her
banner
in
the
form
of
the
dish
towel
flying
over
the
spot
what
are
you
planning
for
supper
she
asked
her
mother
looking
into
the
sitting
room
to
see
how
she
was
feeling
oh
dear
i
do
know
said
gardiner
i
had
given
it
a
thought
i
do
believe
there
anything
left
from
dinner
run
down
to
the
store
will
you
and
get
a
couple
of
porterhouse
steaks
there
a
dear
and
stop
at
the
baker
as
you
come
by
and
get
us
each
a
cream
puff
for
dessert
betty
is
so
fond
of
them
migwan
returned
to
the
kitchen
and
got
her
mother
pocketbook
there
was
just
cents
in
it
migwan
realized
with
a
shock
that
it
would
not
pay
for
what
her
mother
wanted
and
her
sensitive
nature
shrank
from
asking
to
have
things
charged
i
wo
buy
the
cream
puffs
she
decided
i
wonder
if
there
is
anything
in
the
house
i
could
make
into
a
dessert
search
revealed
nothing
but
a
bag
of
prunes
which
had
been
on
the
shelf
for
months
and
were
as
dry
as
a
bone
they
did
not
appeal
to
migwan
in
the
least
but
there
was
nothing
else
in
evidence
i
might
make
prune
whip
she
thought
rather
doubtfully
they
pretty
hard
but
i
can
soak
them
i
need
the
oven
to
make
prune
whip
so
i
will
bake
the
potatoes
too
she
hunted
around
for
the
potatoes
and
finally
found
them
in
a
small
paper
bag
buying
potatoes
two
quarts
at
a
time
must
be
rather
expensive
she
reflected
she
put
the
prunes
to
soak
and
the
potatoes
in
the
oven
and
went
down
to
the
store
how
much
is
porterhouse
steak
she
asked
before
she
had
the
butcher
cut
any
off
cents
a
pound
answered
the
man
behind
the
counter
migwan
gave
a
little
gasp
the
money
she
had
would
not
even
buy
a
pound
how
much
is
round
steak
she
inquired
came
the
reply
give
me
cents
worth
she
said
it
did
not
look
particularly
tender
and
migwan
thought
distressedly
how
her
mother
would
complain
when
she
found
round
steak
instead
of
porterhouse
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
she
said
to
herself
grimly
beggars
can
not
be
choosers
she
stopped
on
the
way
home
to
get
the
recipe
for
prune
whip
from
sahwah
sahwah
was
not
at
home
but
her
mother
gave
migwan
the
recipe
and
added
many
directions
as
to
the
proper
mixing
of
the
ingredients
is
is
there
any
way
of
making
tough
round
steak
tender
she
asked
timidly
just
a
little
ashamed
to
admit
that
they
had
to
eat
round
steak
there
certainly
is
answered
brewster
you
just
pound
all
the
flour
into
it
that
it
will
take
up
i
hardly
ever
buy
porterhouse
steaks
any
more
since
i
learned
that
trick
i
am
having
some
it
is
one
of
our
favorite
dishes
here
round
steak
prepared
in
this
way
is
known
in
the
restaurants
as
steak
and
commands
a
high
price
considerably
cheered
by
this
last
intelligence
migwan
sped
home
and
got
her
prune
dessert
into
the
oven
and
then
set
to
work
transforming
the
tough
steak
into
a
tender
morsel
what
kind
of
meat
is
this
asked
her
mother
when
they
had
taken
their
places
at
the
table
guess
said
migwan
it
tastes
like
tenderloin
said
her
mother
guess
again
said
migwan
gleefully
it
round
steak
the
butcher
must
be
buying
better
meat
than
usual
then
said
gardiner
i
never
got
such
round
steak
as
this
out
here
before
and
you
never
will
either
said
migwan
swelling
with
pride
if
you
leave
it
to
the
butcher
and
she
told
how
she
had
treated
the
steak
to
produce
the
present
result
i
never
heard
of
that
before
said
her
mother
amazed
at
this
simple
culinary
trick
next
the
prune
whip
was
brought
on
and
pronounced
good
by
every
one
and
bully
by
tom
who
ate
his
in
great
spoonfuls
i
see
i
have
to
let
you
get
the
meals
after
this
said
gardiner
to
migwan
you
have
a
knack
of
putting
things
together
which
i
have
not
migwan
was
too
tired
to
write
any
more
that
night
after
the
dishes
were
done
but
she
was
entirely
as
she
wove
into
her
bead
band
the
symbols
of
that
day
achievements
a
broom
and
a
frying
pan
she
had
learned
something
that
afternoon
besides
how
to
prepare
beefsteak
she
had
waked
up
to
the
careless
fashion
in
which
the
house
was
being
run
and
her
head
was
full
of
plans
for
cutting
down
expenses
monday
afternoon
on
her
way
home
from
school
migwan
saw
a
farmer
wagon
standing
in
front
of
the
brewsters
home
and
brewster
stood
at
the
curb
buying
her
winter
supply
of
potatoes
have
you
put
your
potatoes
in
yet
she
asked
as
migwan
came
along
migwan
stopped
i
do
believe
we
ever
bought
them
in
large
quantities
she
answered
how
much
are
they
a
bushel
cents
said
the
farmer
migwan
made
a
quick
mental
calculation
at
the
rate
they
had
been
buying
potatoes
in
lots
they
had
been
paying
a
dollar
and
cents
a
bushel
migwan
came
to
a
sudden
decision
are
they
all
good
she
asked
brewster
they
have
always
been
in
the
past
years
answered
sahwah
mother
and
i
have
bought
my
potatoes
from
this
man
for
the
last
six
winters
how
many
would
it
take
for
a
family
of
four
asked
migwan
about
five
bushels
answered
brewster
all
right
said
migwan
to
the
man
bring
five
bushels
over
to
this
address
the
potatoes
were
duly
deposited
in
the
gardiner
cellar
without
asking
the
advice
of
gardiner
which
was
the
only
safe
way
of
getting
things
done
for
had
she
been
consulted
she
would
surely
have
wanted
to
wait
a
while
and
then
would
have
kept
putting
it
off
until
it
was
too
late
it
was
the
same
way
with
flour
and
sugar
migwan
found
that
her
mother
had
been
buying
these
in
small
quantities
at
an
exorbitant
price
and
calmly
took
matters
into
her
own
hands
ordering
a
whole
barrel
of
flour
because
there
was
more
in
a
barrel
even
than
in
four
sacks
a
certain
large
store
was
offering
a
liberal
discount
that
week
on
fifty
pounds
of
sugar
and
migwan
took
advantage
of
this
sale
also
then
she
had
a
terrified
counting
up
those
three
items
potatoes
flour
and
sugar
had
used
up
every
cent
of
that
week
income
leaving
nothing
at
all
for
running
expenses
all
other
supplies
would
have
to
be
bought
on
credit
migwan
made
a
careful
estimate
of
the
necessary
expenses
for
the
coming
week
and
pare
down
as
she
might
the
sum
was
nearly
fifteen
dollars
the
loss
of
the
rent
money
was
making
itself
keenly
felt
mother
she
said
quietly
looking
up
from
her
account
book
we
live
on
dollars
a
month
we
must
rent
the
house
again
immediately
gardiner
made
a
gesture
of
despair
the
sign
has
been
up
nearly
a
month
and
if
people
do
make
inquiries
i
ca
help
it
have
you
been
in
the
house
since
the
last
people
moved
out
asked
migwan
no
said
gardiner
what
good
would
that
do
i
have
the
time
to
go
all
the
way
over
to
the
east
side
to
look
at
that
old
house
people
know
it
for
rent
and
if
they
want
it
they
take
it
without
my
sitting
over
there
waiting
for
them
nevertheless
migwan
made
the
long
trip
the
very
next
day
after
school
to
look
at
the
property
it
no
wonder
no
one
has
been
making
inquiries
for
it
she
said
when
she
returned
the
rent
sign
was
gone
and
i
found
it
later
when
i
was
going
back
up
the
street
some
boys
had
used
it
to
make
the
end
piece
of
a
wagon
then
the
plumbing
is
bad
and
the
cellar
is
flooded
and
the
water
will
not
run
off
in
the
kitchen
sink
these
must
have
been
the
repairs
the
old
tenants
wanted
made
when
you
told
them
you
had
no
money
to
fix
the
house
and
so
they
moved
i
do
blame
them
at
all
then
there
is
another
thing
i
thought
of
when
i
was
looking
through
the
rooms
you
know
that
big
unfinished
space
over
the
kitchen
well
i
thought
why
ca
we
make
a
furnished
room
of
that
there
is
space
enough
to
build
a
large
room
and
a
bathroom
for
part
of
it
is
just
above
the
bathroom
downstairs
a
large
furnished
room
with
a
private
bath
would
bring
in
ten
dollars
a
month
it
is
just
at
the
head
of
the
back
stairs
and
the
side
door
where
the
back
stairs
connect
with
the
cellar
way
could
be
used
as
a
private
entrance
so
the
tenants
of
the
house
would
not
be
disturbed
in
the
least
it
would
cost
over
a
hundred
dollars
to
do
it
most
likely
but
we
could
borrow
the
money
from
my
college
fund
and
the
extra
rent
would
soon
pay
it
back
migwan
eyes
were
shining
with
ambition
gardiner
shook
her
head
wearily
we
never
could
do
it
she
answered
something
would
surely
happen
to
upset
our
plans
but
migwan
was
not
to
be
waved
aside
she
had
seen
a
vision
of
increased
income
and
meant
to
make
it
come
true
she
argued
the
merits
of
her
idea
until
gardiner
was
too
tired
of
the
subject
to
argue
back
and
agreed
that
if
miss
kent
approved
the
step
she
would
give
her
consent
nyoda
was
therefore
called
into
consultation
she
looked
at
the
house
and
saw
no
reason
why
the
improvements
could
not
be
made
to
advantage
the
house
was
in
a
good
neighborhood
and
furnished
rooms
were
always
in
demand
she
advised
the
step
and
gave
gardiner
the
names
of
several
contractors
whom
she
knew
to
be
reliable
gardiner
was
a
little
breathless
at
the
speed
with
which
things
were
moving
but
there
was
no
stopping
migwan
once
she
was
started
a
contractor
was
engaged
and
work
begun
on
the
house
one
week
from
the
day
migwan
had
thought
of
the
plan
meanwhile
financial
matters
at
home
were
in
bad
shape
and
gardiner
willingly
gave
over
the
distribution
of
the
family
budget
to
migwan
she
herself
was
utterly
unable
to
cope
with
the
problem
and
migwan
surprised
even
herself
by
the
efficient
way
in
which
she
managed
things
by
planning
menus
with
the
greatest
care
and
omitting
meat
from
the
bill
of
fare
to
a
great
extent
she
made
it
possible
to
live
on
their
slender
income
until
the
rent
would
begin
to
come
in
again
whatever
have
you
done
with
yourself
asked
gladys
at
the
weekly
meeting
of
the
camp
fire
of
late
you
rush
home
from
school
as
if
you
were
pursued
migwan
only
laughed
and
said
she
had
had
uncommonly
hard
problems
to
solve
these
last
few
weeks
the
other
girls
of
course
did
not
know
the
exact
state
of
the
gardiner
finances
and
never
dreamed
that
migwan
was
having
a
struggle
even
to
stay
in
high
school
she
was
such
a
fine
girl
and
was
so
sparkling
and
witty
all
the
time
that
it
was
hard
to
connect
her
with
poverty
and
worry
let
all
go
to
the
matinee
next
saturday
afternoon
suggested
gladys
the
bird
is
going
to
be
played
the
girls
agreed
eagerly
and
asked
gladys
to
get
seats
for
them
all
but
migwan
who
said
nothing
do
you
want
to
go
migwan
they
asked
not
this
time
migwan
answered
in
a
casual
tone
there
is
something
else
i
have
to
do
saturday
afternoon
the
girls
accepted
this
explanation
readily
it
never
occurred
to
them
that
migwan
could
not
afford
to
go
what
is
this
mysterious
something
you
are
always
doing
asked
gladys
teasingly
girls
i
believe
migwan
is
writing
a
book
she
has
retired
from
polite
society
altogether
migwan
smiled
blandly
at
her
but
made
no
answer
at
home
that
night
however
she
felt
very
indeed
she
was
only
human
after
all
and
wanted
dreadfully
to
go
to
the
matinee
with
the
girls
gladys
would
take
them
all
to
schiller
afterward
for
a
parfait
and
bring
them
home
in
style
in
her
machine
it
did
not
seem
fair
that
she
should
be
cut
off
from
every
pleasure
that
involved
the
spending
of
a
little
money
this
was
her
last
year
in
high
school
the
year
which
should
be
the
happiest
but
she
must
resolutely
turn
her
face
away
from
all
those
little
festivities
that
add
such
touches
of
color
to
the
memory
fabric
of
school
days
she
knew
that
at
the
merest
hint
of
her
circumstances
to
gladys
or
nyoda
they
would
have
gladly
paid
her
way
everywhere
the
group
went
but
migwan
pride
forbade
this
if
she
could
not
afford
to
go
to
places
she
would
stay
at
home
and
nobody
would
be
any
the
wiser
nevertheless
a
few
tears
would
come
at
the
thought
of
the
good
time
she
was
missing
and
she
had
no
heart
to
work
on
her
story
she
said
to
herself
fiercely
winking
the
tears
back
crying
because
you
ca
do
as
you
would
like
all
the
time
you
lots
better
off
than
poor
hinpoha
this
very
minute
even
if
she
is
rich
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
the
thought
of
hinpoha
who
would
likewise
miss
the
jolly
party
comforted
her
somewhat
and
she
dried
her
tears
and
fell
to
writing
with
a
will
now
nyoda
although
she
did
not
know
just
how
hard
pressed
the
gardiners
were
at
that
time
rather
surmised
something
of
the
kind
and
wondered
after
she
left
the
girls
if
that
were
not
the
reason
for
migwan
not
planning
to
go
to
the
matinee
she
remembered
migwan
saying
some
time
before
that
she
wanted
very
much
to
see
the
bluebird
when
it
came
she
knew
it
would
never
do
to
offer
to
pay
migwan
way
migwan
was
too
proud
for
that
she
lay
awake
a
long
time
over
it
and
finally
formulated
a
plan
the
next
morning
when
migwan
came
to
school
she
saw
a
conspicuous
notice
on
the
bulletin
board
lost
handbag
containing
book
of
lecture
notes
and
ticket
for
saturday
afternoon
performance
of
the
bluebird
finder
may
keep
theater
ticket
if
he
or
she
will
return
notebook
to
miss
moore
room
migwan
read
the
notice
and
passed
on
as
did
the
other
pupils
that
morning
in
english
class
nyoda
sent
migwan
to
an
unused
lecture
room
to
get
an
english
book
she
had
left
there
when
migwan
opened
the
door
she
stumbled
over
something
on
the
floor
it
was
a
lady
handbag
she
opened
it
and
found
miss
moore
notebook
and
the
theater
ticket
inside
miss
moore
was
overjoyed
at
the
return
of
the
notebook
and
insisted
on
her
keeping
the
ticket
which
migwan
at
first
declined
to
accept
my
dear
child
said
miss
moore
if
you
knew
what
trouble
i
had
collecting
those
notes
you
would
think
too
that
it
was
worth
the
price
of
a
theater
ticket
to
get
them
back
and
when
migwan
back
was
turned
she
winked
solemnly
at
nyoda
by
a
curious
coincidence
that
seat
was
directly
behind
those
occupied
by
the
other
winnebagos
chapter
iv
another
kitchen
the
night
of
the
last
camp
fire
meeting
gladys
and
nyoda
might
have
been
seen
in
close
consultation
the
first
pleasant
saturday
said
nyoda
remember
it
my
treat
said
gladys
the
first
week
in
november
was
as
balmy
as
may
with
every
promise
of
fine
weather
on
saturday
accordingly
nyoda
gathered
all
the
winnebagos
around
her
desk
on
thursday
and
made
an
announcement
sahwah
forgot
that
she
was
in
a
class
room
and
started
to
raise
a
joyful
whoop
but
nyoda
stifled
it
in
time
by
putting
her
hand
over
her
mouth
i
ca
help
it
cried
sahwah
we
going
on
a
trip
up
the
river
i
going
to
paddle
the
once
more
the
plan
suggested
by
gladys
and
just
announced
by
nyoda
was
this
the
following
saturday
they
would
charter
a
launch
big
enough
to
hold
them
all
and
follow
the
course
of
the
cuyahoga
river
upstream
to
the
dam
at
the
falls
where
they
would
land
and
cook
their
dinner
over
an
open
fire
they
would
tow
the
sahwah
birchbark
canoe
behind
the
launch
and
some
time
during
the
day
would
manage
to
let
every
one
go
for
a
paddle
the
winnebagos
thrilled
with
pleasurable
anticipation
all
but
hinpoha
who
crept
sadly
away
for
she
could
not
bear
to
hear
about
the
fun
that
was
being
planned
when
she
could
not
have
a
part
in
it
one
desire
of
her
heart
was
being
fulfilled
and
she
was
getting
thin
what
a
whole
summer
of
rigid
dieting
had
not
been
able
to
accomplish
was
brought
to
pass
by
a
few
weeks
of
mental
suffering
and
her
clothes
were
beginning
to
hang
on
her
her
appetite
began
to
fail
her
and
her
aunt
noticing
this
bought
her
a
big
bottle
of
tonic
which
taken
before
meals
killed
any
small
desire
for
food
she
may
have
had
then
aunt
phoebe
decided
that
the
walk
to
school
was
too
much
for
her
and
had
her
taken
and
called
for
in
the
machine
much
to
disgust
for
that
walk
was
her
chief
joy
these
days
after
a
week
of
the
tonic
her
soul
rebelled
against
the
nauseous
dose
and
when
the
first
bottle
was
empty
and
aunt
phoebe
sent
her
to
get
it
refilled
she
refilled
it
herself
with
a
mixture
of
licorice
candy
and
water
which
produced
a
black
syrup
similar
in
appearance
to
the
original
medicine
but
minus
the
bad
taste
and
the
stigma
of
patent
medicine
a
thing
which
the
winnebagos
had
promised
their
guardian
they
would
not
take
as
this
was
deceiving
her
aunt
she
felt
obliged
to
put
a
blot
on
her
head
in
the
form
of
a
black
record
but
she
was
so
inwardly
amused
at
it
that
her
appetite
improved
of
its
own
accord
and
aunt
phoebe
remarked
in
a
gratified
way
that
she
had
never
known
the
equal
of
mullin
modifier
as
a
tonic
migwan
finished
her
story
copied
it
carefully
on
foolscap
and
sent
it
away
to
a
magazine
confident
that
in
a
very
short
time
she
would
behold
it
in
print
and
the
payment
she
would
receive
for
it
would
keep
her
in
spending
money
throughout
the
school
year
so
with
a
light
and
merry
heart
she
set
out
for
gladys
house
on
saturday
morning
where
the
girls
were
all
to
meet
for
the
outing
it
was
one
of
those
days
in
late
autumn
when
the
earth
still
decked
in
her
brilliant
garments
seems
to
lie
spellbound
in
the
sunshine
as
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
the
coming
of
winter
the
girls
clad
in
blue
skirts
and
white
middies
and
heavy
sweaters
were
whirled
down
to
the
dock
in
the
evans
automobile
with
the
tied
upright
at
the
back
the
launch
was
waiting
for
them
at
one
of
the
big
boat
docks
sandwiched
in
between
two
immense
lake
steamers
nothing
could
have
been
a
greater
contrast
to
their
trip
up
the
shadow
river
the
summer
before
than
this
excursion
on
that
other
trip
they
had
been
the
only
living
beings
on
the
horizon
and
nature
was
supreme
everywhere
but
here
they
were
fairly
engulfed
by
the
works
of
man
the
tiny
craft
nosed
her
way
among
giant
steamers
freighters
coal
barges
lighters
fire
boats
tugs
scows
and
all
the
other
kinds
of
vessels
that
crowd
the
of
a
great
lake
port
viewed
from
below
the
steel
structure
of
the
viaduct
over
the
river
stretched
out
like
the
monstrous
skeleton
of
some
prehistoric
beast
whistles
shrieked
deafeningly
in
their
ears
and
trains
pounded
jarringly
over
railroad
bridges
a
bridge
began
to
descend
over
their
very
heads
over
where
the
new
bridge
was
being
constructed
men
stood
on
slender
girders
high
in
the
air
catching
rivets
that
were
being
tossed
them
while
an
automatic
riveting
hammer
filled
the
air
with
its
clamor
everywhere
was
bustle
and
confusion
and
noise
noise
noise
and
in
the
midst
of
this
tumult
the
tiny
launch
filled
with
laughing
girls
threaded
its
way
up
the
black
river
flying
the
winnebago
banner
while
behind
it
trailed
a
birchbark
canoe
with
sahwah
squatting
calmly
in
the
stern
leaning
her
back
against
her
paddle
many
times
they
had
to
bury
their
noses
in
their
handkerchiefs
to
shut
out
the
smells
that
assailed
them
on
every
side
on
they
chugged
past
the
lumber
yards
with
their
acres
of
stacked
boards
some
of
which
had
come
from
the
very
neighborhood
of
camp
winnebago
past
the
chemical
works
pouring
out
its
darkly
polluted
streams
into
the
river
ugh
said
gladys
with
a
shiver
to
think
that
that
stuff
flows
on
into
the
lake
and
we
drink
lake
water
it
seems
like
a
different
world
altogether
said
migwan
looking
out
across
the
miles
of
flats
she
was
perfectly
fascinated
by
the
rolling
mills
with
their
rows
of
black
stacks
standing
out
against
the
sky
like
organ
pipes
and
by
the
long
trains
of
cars
curving
through
the
valley
like
huge
worms
the
divisions
giving
the
effect
of
body
sections
while
the
winnebagos
were
gliding
along
among
scenes
strange
and
new
hinpoha
was
vainly
trying
to
comfort
herself
for
having
to
stay
at
home
by
catching
in
a
bottle
the
bees
which
were
crawling
in
and
out
of
the
cosmos
blossoms
in
the
garden
interesting
as
the
bees
were
however
they
could
not
keep
her
thoughts
from
turning
to
the
winnebagos
afloat
on
the
river
and
it
was
a
very
doleful
face
that
bent
over
the
flowers
her
dismal
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
sharp
voice
of
aunt
phoebe
calling
her
to
come
in
what
is
it
she
asked
listlessly
as
she
came
up
on
the
porch
evans
is
here
said
her
aunt
in
the
doorway
and
she
has
asked
to
see
you
hinpoha
was
very
glad
to
see
evans
who
rose
smilingly
and
took
her
hands
in
hers
how
thin
you
are
getting
child
she
exclaimed
smoothing
back
the
red
curls
i
do
believe
you
get
out
enough
by
the
way
she
said
to
aunt
phoebe
may
i
borrow
this
girl
for
i
have
considerable
driving
about
to
do
and
it
is
rather
tiresome
going
alone
gladys
has
gone
on
an
boat
ride
aunt
phoebe
could
not
very
well
refuse
for
driving
about
in
a
machine
with
an
older
woman
was
a
very
proper
form
of
recreation
indeed
in
her
estimation
hinpoha
flew
upstairs
and
deposited
her
bottle
of
bees
on
the
table
in
her
room
for
future
observation
and
started
off
with
evans
we
will
not
be
back
for
lunch
and
possibly
not
for
supper
said
mother
as
she
bade
aunt
phoebe
a
gracious
but
it
will
not
be
long
after
that
and
now
for
a
grand
spin
she
said
as
she
started
the
car
and
sent
it
crackling
through
the
dry
leaves
on
the
pavement
now
i
see
why
the
indians
named
this
river
or
said
migwan
as
they
rounded
bend
after
bend
in
the
stream
it
coils
back
on
itself
like
a
snake
and
i
have
already
counted
seven
coils
within
the
city
limits
i
did
believe
it
when
the
captain
of
a
freighter
told
me
that
there
was
a
place
in
the
river
which
his
boat
could
pass
because
two
sharp
turns
came
so
near
together
but
now
i
see
how
that
could
easily
be
possible
as
the
launch
steadily
up
the
river
the
water
gradually
became
less
black
and
the
factories
along
the
shore
gave
way
to
open
stretches
of
country
by
noon
they
reached
the
dam
and
went
ashore
to
look
for
a
place
to
build
a
fire
they
were
in
a
deep
gorge
its
steep
sides
thickly
covered
with
flaming
maples
and
oaks
and
brilliant
sumachs
stretching
on
either
side
as
far
as
they
could
reach
it
too
gorgeous
to
seem
real
said
nyoda
shading
her
eyes
and
looking
down
the
valley
where
mother
nature
keep
her
pot
of
dyes
in
the
summer
time
high
up
along
the
top
of
one
of
the
cliffs
a
narrow
road
wound
along
and
as
nyoda
stood
looking
into
the
distance
she
saw
an
automobile
coming
along
this
road
when
it
was
directly
above
her
it
stopped
and
two
people
got
out
a
woman
and
a
girl
the
sunlight
fell
on
a
mass
of
red
curls
on
the
girl
head
hinpoha
exclaimed
nyoda
in
amazement
from
above
came
floating
down
a
yodel
the
familiar
winnebago
call
the
girls
all
looked
up
in
surprise
to
see
hinpoha
scrambling
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
aiding
evans
to
descend
why
called
gladys
running
up
to
meet
her
the
surprise
at
the
meeting
was
mutual
evans
spinning
along
the
country
roads
had
no
idea
she
was
hard
on
the
trail
of
her
daughter
and
the
other
winnebagos
until
she
came
suddenly
upon
them
after
they
had
gotten
out
of
the
launch
ca
you
stay
and
spend
the
day
with
us
now
that
you
here
they
pleaded
hinpoha
longing
soul
looked
out
of
her
eyes
but
she
answered
afraid
not
aunt
phoebe
would
approve
did
she
say
you
could
asked
sahwah
no
said
hinpoha
for
i
never
even
asked
her
if
i
might
go
along
with
you
in
the
launch
i
knew
it
would
be
no
use
oh
please
stay
tempted
some
of
the
girls
your
aunt
never
know
the
difference
oh
i
could
do
that
said
hinpoha
in
a
tone
of
horror
a
little
approving
smile
crept
around
the
corners
of
nyoda
eyes
as
she
heard
hinpoha
so
resolutely
bidding
satan
get
behind
her
evans
was
genuinely
sorry
they
had
encountered
the
girls
because
it
made
it
so
much
harder
for
hinpoha
i
wonder
she
said
musingly
if
i
drove
on
to
a
house
in
the
road
and
telephoned
your
aunt
that
she
would
let
you
stay
you
might
try
said
hinpoha
doubtfully
evans
thought
it
was
worth
trying
she
found
a
house
with
a
telephone
and
got
aunt
phoebe
on
the
wire
with
the
utmost
tact
she
explained
how
they
had
met
the
girls
accidently
and
that
she
had
taken
a
notion
that
she
would
like
to
spend
the
day
with
them
but
of
course
she
could
not
do
so
unless
hinpoha
would
be
allowed
to
stay
with
her
as
she
had
charge
of
her
for
the
day
what
was
aunt
phoebe
to
do
she
was
not
equal
to
telling
the
admired
evans
to
forego
her
pleasure
because
of
hinpoha
and
gave
a
grudging
consent
to
her
keeping
her
niece
with
her
on
the
condition
that
she
would
bring
her
home
in
the
machine
and
not
let
her
come
back
in
the
launch
with
the
winnebagos
jubilant
they
returned
to
the
girls
in
the
gorge
and
told
the
good
news
cheer
for
evans
cried
sahwah
and
the
winnebagos
gave
it
with
a
hearty
good
will
hinpoha
with
sahwah
close
beside
her
began
i
searching
for
firewood
industriously
it
seems
just
like
last
summer
she
said
chopping
sticks
with
sahwah
hatchet
the
two
had
wandered
off
a
short
distance
from
the
others
following
a
tiny
footpath
suddenly
they
came
upon
a
huge
rock
formation
that
looked
like
an
immense
fireplace
about
forty
feet
wide
and
twenty
or
more
feet
high
under
that
great
stone
arch
a
dozen
spits
each
big
enough
to
hold
a
whole
ox
might
easily
have
swung
sahwah
and
hinpoha
looked
at
it
in
amazement
and
then
called
for
the
other
girls
to
come
and
see
why
that
the
maid
kitchen
said
evans
when
she
arrived
on
the
scene
i
been
here
before
just
why
it
should
be
called
the
kitchen
is
more
than
i
can
tell
for
it
looks
like
the
fireplace
belonging
to
the
of
all
giantesses
let
build
our
fire
inside
of
it
said
nyoda
the
original
maid
had
a
convenience
that
did
usually
go
with
open
fireplaces
said
gladys
and
that
is
running
water
and
she
held
her
cup
under
a
tiny
stream
that
trickled
out
between
two
rocks
cold
as
ice
and
clear
as
crystal
would
this
be
a
grand
place
for
a
ceremonial
meeting
said
migwan
as
they
all
stood
round
the
blazing
fire
roasting
wieners
and
bacon
the
kitchen
had
a
floor
of
smooth
slabs
of
rock
and
the
arch
of
the
fireplace
formed
a
roof
over
their
heads
while
its
wide
opening
afforded
them
a
wonderful
view
of
the
gorge
whenever
you
want
to
come
here
again
just
say
so
said
evans
and
i
bring
you
down
in
the
machine
evans
was
enjoying
herself
as
much
as
any
of
the
girls
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
cooked
wieners
and
bacon
over
an
open
fire
on
green
sticks
and
she
was
perfectly
delighted
with
the
experience
if
my
husband
could
only
see
me
now
she
said
laughing
like
a
girl
as
she
dropped
her
last
wiener
in
the
dirt
and
calmly
washed
it
off
in
the
trickling
stream
how
good
this
hot
cocoa
tastes
she
exclaimed
drinking
down
a
whole
cupful
without
stopping
what
kind
is
it
camp
fire
girl
cocoa
answered
the
girls
what
kind
is
that
asked
evans
it
is
a
brand
that
is
put
up
by
a
new
york
firm
for
the
camp
fire
girls
to
sell
answered
nyoda
why
have
we
never
had
any
of
this
at
our
house
asked
evans
turning
to
gladys
you
have
always
insisted
that
you
would
use
no
other
kind
than
van
horn
replied
gladys
so
i
thought
there
would
be
no
use
in
mentioning
it
i
like
this
better
than
van
horn
said
her
mother
is
there
any
to
be
had
now
there
certainly
is
answered
nyoda
we
are
trying
to
dispose
of
a
lot
to
pay
our
annual
dues
let
me
have
a
dozen
cans
said
evans
i
will
serve
camp
fire
girl
cocoa
to
my
civic
club
next
wednesday
afternoon
i
here
a
terrific
shriek
from
migwan
brought
them
all
to
their
feet
she
had
been
poking
about
in
the
corner
of
the
kitchen
when
something
had
suddenly
jumped
out
at
her
unfolded
itself
like
a
fan
and
was
whirling
around
her
head
it
a
bat
cried
sahwah
and
they
all
laughed
heartily
at
migwan
fright
the
bat
wheeled
around
blind
in
the
daylight
and
went
bumping
against
the
girls
causing
them
to
run
in
alarm
lest
it
should
get
entangled
in
their
hair
it
finally
found
its
way
back
to
the
dark
corner
of
the
kitchen
and
hung
itself
up
neatly
the
way
migwan
had
found
it
and
the
dinner
proceeded
what
kind
of
a
bat
was
it
asked
gladys
must
have
been
a
said
sahwah
dodging
the
acorn
that
hinpoha
threw
at
her
for
making
a
pun
tell
us
a
new
game
to
play
nyoda
said
gladys
or
sahwah
will
go
right
on
making
puns
here
is
one
i
thought
of
on
the
way
down
answered
nyoda
think
of
all
the
things
that
you
know
are
manufactured
in
cleveland
or
form
an
important
part
of
the
shipping
industry
then
we
go
around
the
circle
naming
them
in
alphabetical
order
each
girl
may
have
ten
seconds
in
which
to
think
when
her
turn
comes
and
if
she
misses
she
is
out
of
the
game
she
may
only
come
in
again
by
supplying
a
word
when
another
has
missed
before
the
next
girl
in
the
circle
can
think
of
one
and
let
the
two
that
hold
out
the
longest
have
the
first
ride
in
the
canoe

back
to
sahwah
zerolene
she
said
what
that
they
all
cried
i
do
know
she
answered
but
i
saw
it
on
one
of
the
big
oil
tanks
as
we
passed
sahwah
and
nyoda
won
the
right
to
take
the
first
paddle
in
the
they
carried
the
canoe
on
their
heads
portage
fashion
around
the
dam
and
launched
it
up
above
where
the
confined
waters
had
spread
out
into
a
wide
pond
oh
what
a
joy
to
dip
a
paddle
again
sighed
sahwah
blissfully
sending
the
flying
through
the
water
with
long
vigorous
strokes
i
love
to
paddle
all
the
way
home
she
had
completely
forgotten
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
school
and
lessons
in
the
world
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
river
and
this
was
a
joyous
homecoming
time
to
go
back
and
let
the
rest
have
a
turn
said
nyoda
reluctantly
sahwah
steered
the
canoe
around
and
returned
to
the
waiting
group
evans
watched
with
interest
as
gladys
and
hinpoha
pushed
out
from
shore
could
this
be
her
once
frail
daughter
who
had
despised
all
strenuous
sports
and
hated
water
above
all
things
who
was
swinging
her
paddle
so
lustily
and
steering
the
so
skilfully
what
was
this
strange
something
that
the
camp
fire
had
instilled
into
her
she
caught
her
breath
with
the
beauty
of
it
as
the
girls
glided
along
between
the
radiant
banks
the
two
paddles
flashing
in
and
out
in
perfect
rhythm
they
were
singing
a
favorite
boating
song
and
their
voices
floated
back
on
the
breeze
through
the
mystic
haze
of
the
autumn
days
like
a
phantom
ghost
i
glide
where
the
big
moose
sees
the
crimson
trees
mirrored
on
the
silver
tide
and
the
blood
red
sun
when
day
is
done
sinks
below
the
hill
the
night
hawk
swoops
the
lily
droops
and
all
the
world
is
still
sahwah
lingered
on
the
river
after
the
others
had
gone
in
a
body
to
try
to
climb
to
the
top
of
the
rocky
fireplace
she
was
all
alone
in
the
and
sent
it
darting
around
like
a
water
spider
on
the
surface
of
the
stream
so
absorbed
was
she
in
the
joy
of
paddling
that
she
did
not
see
a
sign
on
a
tree
beside
the
river
which
warned
people
in
boats
to
go
no
further
than
that
point
neither
did
she
realize
the
significance
of
the
quicker
progress
which
the
was
making
when
she
did
realize
that
she
was
getting
dangerously
near
the
edge
of
the
dam
and
attempted
to
turn
back
she
discovered
to
her
horror
that
it
was
impossible
to
turn
back
the
was
being
swept
helplessly
and
irresistibly
onward
recent
rains
had
swollen
the
stream
and
the
water
was
pouring
over
the
dam
sahwah
screamed
aloud
when
she
saw
the
peril
in
which
she
was
nyoda
and
evans
and
the
girls
standing
up
on
the
rocks
turned
and
saw
her
help
was
out
of
the
question
frozen
to
the
spot
they
saw
her
rushing
along
to
that
descent
of
waters
gladys
moaned
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
below
the
falls
the
great
rocks
jutted
out
jagged
and
bare
any
boat
going
over
would
be
dashed
to
pieces
the
shot
forward
gaining
speed
with
every
second
the
roar
of
the
falls
filled
sahwah
ears
not
ten
feet
from
the
brink
a
rock
jutted
up
a
little
above
the
surface
just
enough
to
divide
the
current
into
two
streams
when
the
reached
this
point
it
turned
sharply
and
was
hurled
into
the
current
nearest
the
shore
on
the
bank
right
at
the
brink
of
the
falls
stood
a
great
willow
tree
its
long
branches
drooping
far
out
over
the
water
it
was
one
chance
in
a
million
and
sahwah
saw
it
as
she
passed
under
the
tree
she
reached
up
and
caught
hold
of
a
branch
seized
it
firmly
and
jumped
clear
of
the
canoe
which
went
over
the
falls
almost
under
her
feet
then
swinging
along
by
her
arms
she
reached
the
shore
and
stood
in
safety
it
had
all
happened
so
quickly
the
girls
could
hardly
comprehend
it
gladys
who
had
hidden
her
eyes
to
shut
out
the
dreadful
sight
heard
an
incredulous
shout
from
the
girls
and
looked
down
to
see
the
landing
on
the
rocks
below
empty
and
sahwah
standing
on
the
bank
how
did
you
ever
manage
to
do
it
gasped
hinpoha
when
they
had
surrounded
her
with
exclamations
of
joy
and
amazement
you
a
heroine
again
you
nothing
of
the
sort
said
nyoda
it
was
sheer
foolhardiness
or
carelessness
that
got
you
into
that
scrape
a
girl
who
does
know
enough
to
keep
out
of
the
current
is
to
be
trusted
with
a
canoe
no
matter
what
a
fine
paddler
she
is
i
certainly
thought
better
of
you
than
that
sahwah
i
never
used
to
have
the
slightest
anxiety
when
you
were
on
the
water
i
had
such
a
perfect
trust
in
your
common
sense
but
now
i
can
never
feel
quite
sure
of
you
again
sahwah
hung
her
head
in
shame
for
she
felt
the
truth
of
nyoda
words
i
think
you
can
trust
me
after
this
she
said
humbly
i
have
learned
my
lesson
she
was
not
likely
to
forget
the
horror
of
the
moment
when
she
had
heard
the
water
roaring
over
the
dam
and
thought
her
time
had
come
sahwah
liked
to
be
thought
clever
as
well
as
daring
and
it
was
certainly
far
from
clever
to
run
blindly
into
danger
as
she
had
done
she
sank
dejectedly
down
on
the
bank
feeling
disgraced
forever
in
the
eyes
of
the
winnebagos
girls
said
evans
wishing
to
take
their
minds
off
the
fright
they
had
received
do
you
know
that
we
are
not
many
miles
from
one
of
the
model
dairy
farms
of
the
world
i
could
take
you
over
in
the
car
and
bring
you
back
here
in
time
to
go
home
in
the
launch
let
do
it
nyoda
begged
all
the
winnebagos
and
into
the
machine
they
piled
when
they
were
still
far
in
the
distance
they
could
see
the
high
towers
of
the
barns
rising
in
the
air
we
nearly
there
said
evans
here
is
the
beginning
to
the
cement
fence
that
runs
all
the
way
around
the
farm
evans
knew
some
of
the
people
in
charge
of
the
farm
and
they
had
no
difficulty
gaining
admittance
that
visit
to
the
carter
farm
was
a
one
the
girls
walked
through
the
long
stables
exclaiming
at
everything
they
saw
why
there
an
electric
fan
in
each
stall
gasped
migwan
and
the
windows
are
screened
oo
look
at
the
darling
calf
gurgled
hinpoha
on
her
knees
before
one
of
the
stalls
caressing
a
baby
it
does
look
a
bit
like
its
mother
observed
nyoda
comparing
it
with
the
cow
standing
beside
it
that
is
its
mother
that
its
nurse
said
the
man
who
was
showing
them
around
its
what
said
nyoda
then
the
man
explained
that
the
milk
from
the
blooded
cows
was
too
valuable
to
be
fed
to
calves
as
it
commanded
a
high
price
on
the
market
and
so
a
herd
of
common
cows
were
kept
to
feed
the
aristocratic
babies
the
lovely
little
creatures
were
as
tame
as
kittens
and
allowed
the
girls
to
fondle
them
to
their
hearts
content
sometimes
a
pair
of
polished
horns
would
come
poking
between
a
calf
and
the
visitors
and
a
cow
would
view
the
proceedings
with
a
comically
anxious
face
and
then
it
was
easy
to
tell
which
calf
was
with
its
mother
in
one
of
the
largest
stalls
they
saw
the
champion
guernsey
of
the
world
her
coat
was
like
satin
and
her
horns
were
polished
until
they
shone
she
did
not
seem
to
be
in
the
least
set
up
on
account
of
her
great
reputation
and
thrust
out
her
nose
in
the
friendliest
manner
possible
to
be
patted
and
fussed
over
she
eyed
gladys
who
stood
next
to
her
with
amiable
curiosity
and
then
suddenly
licked
her
face
evans
watched
gladys
in
surprise
instead
of
quivering
all
over
with
disgust
as
she
would
have
a
year
ago
she
simply
laughed
and
patted
the
cow
nose
what
is
going
to
happen
said
evans
to
herself
gladys
is
afraid
of
cows
any
more
but
the
most
interesting
part
came
when
the
cows
were
milked
they
were
driven
into
another
barn
for
this
performance
and
their
heads
fastened
into
sort
of
metal
hoops
suspended
from
the
ceiling
these
turned
in
either
direction
and
caused
them
no
discomfort
but
kept
them
standing
in
one
place
the
milking
was
done
with
machines
run
by
electricity
and
took
only
a
short
time
when
the
girls
had
watched
the
process
as
long
as
they
wished
they
were
taken
to
see
the
prize
hogs
and
chickens
and
then
went
through
the
hot
houses
there
were
rows
and
rows
of
glass
houses
filled
with
grapes
the
great
bunches
hanging
down
from
the
roof
and
threatening
to
fall
with
their
own
weight
and
one
did
fall
just
as
they
were
going
through
and
came
smashing
down
in
the
path
at
their
feet
nakwisi
ran
to
pick
it
up
and
the
guide
said
she
might
have
it
adding
that
such
a
bunch
unbruised
sold
for
cents
in
the
city
market
oh
how
delicious
cried
nakwisi
tasting
the
grapes
and
dividing
them
among
the
girls
evans
bought
a
basketful
and
let
them
eat
all
they
wanted
in
some
of
the
hothouses
tangerines
were
growing
and
in
some
persimmons
while
others
were
given
over
to
the
raising
of
roses
carnations
and
rare
orchids
it
was
a
trip
through
fairyland
for
the
girls
and
they
could
hardly
tear
themselves
away
when
the
time
came
there
is
something
else
i
must
show
you
while
we
are
in
the
neighborhood
said
evans
as
they
passed
through
akron
does
anybody
know
what
two
historical
things
are
near
here
nobody
knew
evans
began
humming
john
brown
body
lies
in
the
grave
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
asked
gladys
everything
with
one
of
them
said
evans
did
you
know
that
john
brown
owner
of
the
said
body
was
born
in
akron
and
there
is
a
monument
here
to
his
memory
oh
how
lovely
cried
migwan
let
us
see
it
so
evans
drove
them
over
to
the
monument
and
they
all
stood
around
it
and
sang
john
body
in
his
honor
now
what
the
other
thing
they
asked
i
believe
i
know
said
nyoda
does
the
old
portage
trail
run
through
here
somewhere
that
it
said
evans
then
nyoda
told
them
about
the
portage
path
of
indian
days
before
the
canal
was
built
that
extended
from
lake
erie
to
the
ohio
river
the
part
that
runs
through
akron
is
still
called
portage
path
said
evans
and
the
girls
were
eager
to
see
it
why
it
nothing
but
a
paved
street
exclaimed
migwan
in
disappointment
when
they
had
reached
the
historical
spot
that
all
it
is
now
answered
evans
but
it
is
built
over
the
old
portage
trail
and
some
of
these
old
trees
undoubtedly
shaded
the
original
path
in
the
minds
of
the
girls
the
handsome
residences
faded
from
sight
and
in
place
of
the
wide
street
they
saw
the
narrow
path
trailing
off
through
the
forest
with
dusky
forms
stealing
along
it
on
their
long
journey
southward
it
time
to
strike
our
own
trail
now
said
nyoda
breaking
the
silence
and
they
started
back
to
the
river
every
one
was
anxious
to
make
it
as
pleasant
as
possible
for
hinpoha
and
the
jests
came
thick
and
fast
as
they
drove
along
who
is
the
best
latin
scholar
here
asked
nyoda
i
am
said
sahwah
mischievously
then
you
can
undoubtedly
tell
me
what
caesar
said
on
the
fourth
of
july
said
nyoda
i
do
seem
to
recollect
said
sahwah
then
read
for
yourself
said
nyoda
scribbling
a
few
words
on
a
leaf
from
her
notebook
and
handing
it
to
her
what
this
said
sahwah
spelling
out
the
words
on
the
paper
was
written
crudis
enim
rufus
albus
et
sahwah
tried
to
translate
who
raw
for
answered
migwan
and
said
sahwah
what
that
from
answered
migwan
expiravi
it
means
is
blown
is
continued
sahwah
and
is
migwan
nodded
and
sahwah
went
back
to
the
beginning
and
began
to
read
raw
for
red
white
and
have
nyoda
shouted
that
last
word
is
not
she
said
i
have
it
cried
migwan
jumping
up
it
raw
for
the
red
white
and
blew
for
the
red
white
and
blue
such
wit
said
sahwah
laughing
with
the
rest
now
i
make
a
motto
for
sahwah
said
migwan
seizing
the
pencil
migwan
was
a
senior
and
took
french
and
having
a
sudden
inspiration
she
wrote
de
lieu
rhone
que
nous
the
girls
could
not
translate
it
and
nyoda
puzzled
over
it
for
a
long
time
i
do
seem
to
be
able
to
make
anything
out
of
it
she
said
at
length
do
try
to
translate
it
said
migwan
just
read
it
out
loud
nyoda
complied
and
sahwah
caught
it
immediately
it
your
own
canoe
she
cried
thus
laughing
and
joking
they
followed
the
road
back
to
the
dam
and
embarked
in
the
launch
with
all
speed
for
the
sun
was
already
sinking
beneath
the
treetops
and
they
had
a
ride
ahead
of
them
evans
took
hinpoha
back
in
the
machine
and
delivered
her
to
her
aunt
safe
and
sound
at
eight
with
many
expressions
of
pleasure
at
the
fun
she
had
had
with
the
camp
fire
girls
which
were
intended
as
seeds
to
be
planted
in
aunt
phoebe
mind
i
think
your
mother
a
perfect
dear
said
sahwah
to
gladys
on
the
trip
home
i
used
to
be
frightened
to
death
of
her
because
she
always
looked
so
and
proper
but
she
is
like
that
at
all
she
a
regular
camp
fire
girl
chapter
a
coasting
party
the
memory
of
that
happy
day
sustained
hinpoha
through
many
of
the
trials
that
came
to
her
in
the
days
that
followed
it
seemed
that
everything
she
did
brought
down
the
wrath
of
her
aunt
in
some
way
or
another
for
instance
she
left
a
bottle
of
bees
standing
on
the
table
in
her
room
and
aunt
phoebe
dog
silky
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
going
into
the
room
and
chewing
hinpoha
painted
paddle
knocked
the
bottle
over
and
let
the
bees
out
getting
badly
stung
in
the
process
then
there
was
a
scene
with
aunt
phoebe
because
she
had
brought
the
bees
in
this
and
a
dozen
more
incidents
of
a
similar
nature
made
hinpoha
despair
of
ever
gaining
the
good
will
of
her
aunt
thus
the
autumn
wore
away
to
winter
and
as
yet
the
desert
of
waiting
had
borne
nothing
but
thorns
gladys
progress
through
school
was
like
the
advance
of
a
conquering
hero
although
she
had
just
entered
this
fall
she
was
already
one
of
the
most
popular
girls
in
school
she
had
that
fair
delicate
prettiness
which
invariably
appeals
to
boys
and
an
open
unaffected
manner
which
endeared
her
to
the
girls
beside
her
very
lovable
personality
she
had
a
background
which
was
almost
certain
to
insure
popularity
to
a
girl
she
was
rich
and
lived
in
a
great
house
on
a
fashionable
avenue
she
had
a
little
electric
car
all
her
own
and
she
wore
the
smartest
clothes
of
any
girl
in
school
her
fame
as
a
dancer
soon
spread
and
she
was
in
constant
demand
at
school
entertainments
nyoda
watched
her
a
trifle
anxiously
at
first
she
was
just
a
little
afraid
that
gladys
head
would
be
turned
with
all
the
homage
paid
her
or
that
blinded
by
her
present
success
she
would
lose
the
deeper
meanings
of
life
and
be
nothing
but
a
butterfly
after
all
but
she
need
not
have
feared
gladys
experience
in
camp
had
kindled
a
fire
in
her
that
would
never
be
extinguished
as
long
as
life
guarded
the
flame
having
changed
her
camp
fire
name
from
butterfly
to
real
woman
she
was
anxious
to
prove
her
right
to
the
name
so
she
worked
diligently
to
win
new
honors
which
made
her
efficient
in
the
home
as
well
as
those
which
helped
her
to
shine
in
society
evans
was
returning
from
an
afternoon
card
party
she
was
tired
and
her
head
ached
and
she
felt
out
of
sorts
a
remark
which
she
had
overheard
during
the
afternoon
stayed
in
her
mind
and
made
her
cross
two
ladies
on
the
other
side
of
a
large
screen
near
which
she
was
sitting
were
discussing
a
campaign
in
which
they
were
interested
to
raise
funds
for
a
certain
philanthropy
i
am
going
to
ask
evans
if
she
would
not
like
to
subscribe
one
hundred
dollars
said
the
one
lady
so
much
asked
the
other
in
an
uncertain
voice
i
do
believe
i
would
if
i
were
you
why
not
asked
the
first
lady
have
you
heard
replied
the
second
lady
with
the
air
of
imparting
a
delicious
secret
that
evans
is
on
the
verge
of
financial
ruin
no
replied
the
second
in
a
tone
of
lively
interest
i
have
who
told
you
so
a
great
many
people
are
saying
so
continued
the
first
do
you
know
that
they
took
their
daughter
out
of
the
private
school
she
had
been
attending
and
sent
her
to
public
school
this
year
they
must
be
hard
up
if
they
ca
pay
school
bills
any
more
it
certainly
looks
like
it
said
the
first
lady
possibly
i
had
better
not
ask
evans
for
any
subscription
at
all
it
might
embarrass
her
poor
thing
the
voices
trailed
off
and
evans
was
left
feeling
decidedly
annoyed
she
was
the
kind
of
woman
who
rarely
discussed
other
people
affairs
and
likewise
disliked
having
her
own
discussed
by
other
people
the
thought
that
some
folks
might
misconstrue
gladys
entering
the
public
school
to
mean
that
her
father
was
about
to
fail
in
business
first
amused
and
then
irritated
her
nothing
like
that
could
be
farther
from
correct
but
the
thought
came
to
her
that
such
rumors
floating
around
might
have
some
effect
on
evans
standing
in
the
business
world
she
began
to
wonder
if
after
all
it
had
not
been
a
mistake
to
take
gladys
out
of
miss
russell
school
in
the
middle
of
her
course
thinking
cynical
thoughts
about
the
gossiping
abilities
of
most
people
she
drove
up
the
long
driveway
and
entered
the
house
the
long
hall
with
its
wide
staircase
and
large
splendidly
furnished
rooms
opening
on
either
side
struck
her
as
being
cold
and
gloomy
the
polished
chairs
and
tables
shone
dully
in
the
fast
waning
light
of
the
december
afternoon
cheerless
and
unfriendly
looking
the
house
suddenly
seemed
to
her
to
be
less
a
home
than
a
collection
of
furniture
for
the
moment
she
almost
hated
the
wealth
which
made
it
necessary
to
maintain
this
vast
and
magnificent
display
the
women
she
had
played
cards
with
that
afternoon
seemed
shallow
and
artificial
life
was
decidedly
uninteresting
just
then
she
went
upstairs
and
took
off
her
wraps
and
came
down
again
aimlessly
gladys
was
nowhere
in
sight
which
made
the
house
seem
lonelier
than
ever
for
with
gladys
around
there
would
have
been
somebody
to
talk
to
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
paused
she
could
hear
some
one
singing
in
a
distant
part
of
the
house
happy
anyway
she
said
with
a
sigh
if
she
feels
like
singing
in
that
hot
kitchen
a
desire
for
company
led
her
out
to
the
kitchen
it
was
not
katy
however
who
greeted
her
when
she
opened
the
door
it
was
gladys
gladys
with
a
big
apron
on
and
her
sleeves
rolled
up
just
taking
from
the
oven
a
pan
of
golden
brown
muffins
the
room
was
filled
with
the
delicious
odor
of
freshly
baked
dough
gladys
looked
up
with
a
smile
when
she
saw
her
mother
in
the
doorway
how
do
you
like
the
new
cook
she
asked
katy
went
home
sick
this
afternoon
and
i
thought
i
would
get
supper
myself
the
kitchen
looked
so
cheerful
and
inviting
that
evans
came
in
and
sat
down
gladys
began
mixing
up
potatoes
for
croquettes
ca
i
do
something
asked
her
mother
why
yes
said
gladys
bringing
out
another
apron
and
tying
it
around
her
waist
you
heat
the
fat
to
fry
these
in
evans
and
gladys
had
never
had
such
a
good
time
together
gladys
had
planned
the
entire
menu
and
her
mother
meekly
followed
her
directions
as
to
what
to
do
next
she
and
gladys
frolicked
around
the
kitchen
with
increasing
hilarity
as
the
supper
progressed
never
before
had
there
existed
such
a
comradeship
between
them
do
you
think
this
is
seasoned
right
asked
evans
holding
out
a
spoonful
of
white
sauce
for
gladys
to
taste
a
little
more
salt
said
gladys
judicially
evans
had
forgotten
her
irritation
of
the
afternoon
the
conversation
which
had
aroused
her
ire
before
now
struck
her
as
humorous
if
davis
and
jones
could
only
see
me
now
she
thought
with
an
inward
chuckle
doing
my
own
cooking
the
plan
of
sending
gladys
back
to
miss
russell
the
first
of
the
year
faded
from
her
mind
send
gladys
away
why
she
was
just
beginning
to
enjoy
her
company
another
plan
presented
itself
to
her
mind
in
the
christmas
vacation
gladys
should
give
a
party
which
would
forever
dispel
any
doubts
about
the
soundness
of
their
financial
standing
her
brain
was
already
at
work
on
the
details
gladys
should
have
a
dress
from
madame
charmant
in
new
york
they
would
have
waldstein
from
the
symphony
orchestra
with
a
half
dozen
of
his
best
players
furnish
the
music
there
would
be
expensive
prizes
and
favors
for
the
games
davis
and
jones
would
have
a
chance
to
alter
their
opinions
when
their
daughters
brought
home
accounts
of
the
affair
she
planned
the
whole
thing
while
she
was
eating
her
supper
after
supper
gladys
washed
the
dishes
and
her
mother
wiped
them
and
they
put
them
away
together
then
gladys
began
to
get
ready
to
go
to
camp
fire
meeting
and
evans
reluctantly
prepared
to
go
out
for
the
evening
the
nearer
ready
she
was
the
more
disinclined
she
felt
to
go
those
jamieson
musicales
are
always
such
a
bore
she
said
to
herself
wearily
they
never
have
good
singers
my
gladys
could
do
better
than
any
of
them
and
they
are
interminable
father
looks
tired
to
death
and
i
know
he
would
rather
stay
at
home
gladys
she
called
looking
into
her
daughter
room
where
is
your
camp
fire
meeting
at
the
brewsters
answered
gladys
do
you
ever
have
visitors
continued
her
mother
why
yes
answered
gladys
we
often
do
do
you
mind
if
you
have
one
asked
evans
certainly
not
replied
gladys
well
then
i
coming
along
said
her
mother
will
you
cried
gladys
oh
goody
the
winnebagos
were
surprised
and
delighted
when
evans
appeared
with
gladys
since
that
outing
she
had
held
a
very
warm
place
in
their
affections
come
in
mother
called
sahwah
you
might
as
well
join
the
group
too
we
have
one
guest
this
is
evans
gladys
mother
she
said
when
her
mother
appeared
after
hastily
brushing
back
her
hair
and
putting
on
a
white
apron
the
two
women
held
out
their
hands
in
formal
greeting
and
then
changed
their
minds
and
fell
on
each
other
necks
why
molly
richards
exclaimed
evans
why
helen
adamson
gasped
brewster
the
winnebagos
looked
on
mystified
you
ca
introduce
me
to
your
mother
said
evans
to
sahwah
laughing
at
her
look
of
surprise
we
were
good
friends
when
we
were
younger
than
you
do
you
remember
the
time
she
said
turning
back
to
brewster
when
you
drew
a
picture
of
miss
scully
in
your
history
and
she
found
it
and
made
you
stand
up
in
front
of
the
room
and
hold
it
up
so
the
whole
class
could
see
it
do
you
remember
the
time
returned
brewster
when
we
ran
away
from
school
to
see
the
lilliputian
bazaar
and
your
mother
was
there
and
walked
you
out
by
the
ear
thus
the
flow
of
reminiscences
went
on
how
little
i
thought
said
evans
when
i
first
saw
sarah
ann
going
around
with
gladys
that
she
was
your
daughter
how
little
i
thought
said
brewster
when
gladys
began
coming
here
that
she
was
daughter
how
many
more
of
these
girls
mothers
are
our
old
schoolmates
i
wonder
said
evans
let
meet
them
and
find
out
said
brewster
here
you
girls
she
said
every
one
of
you
go
home
and
get
your
mother
delightedly
the
girls
obeyed
and
the
mothers
came
a
little
backward
some
of
them
a
little
shy
pathetically
eager
and
decidedly
breathless
mother
gardiner
had
known
brewster
in
her
girlhood
and
nakwisi
mother
had
known
evans
and
chapa
and
mothers
had
known
each
other
what
a
happy
reunion
that
was
and
what
a
chorus
of
do
you
remembers
rose
on
every
side
tears
mingled
with
the
laughter
when
they
spoke
of
the
death
of
bradford
whom
most
of
them
had
known
in
their
school
days
do
you
remember
said
one
of
the
mothers
how
we
used
to
go
coasting
down
the
reservoir
hill
you
girls
have
never
seen
the
old
reservoir
it
was
levelled
off
years
ago
i
enjoy
going
coasting
yet
said
brewster
let
said
evans
the
snow
is
just
right
girls
and
mothers
hurried
into
their
coats
and
out
into
the
frosty
air
the
street
sloped
down
sharply
and
the
middle
of
the
road
was
filled
with
flying
bobsleds
as
the
young
people
of
the
neighborhood
took
advantage
of
the
snowy
crust
sahwah
brought
out
her
brother
bob
which
he
was
not
using
this
evening
and
piled
the
whole
company
on
behind
her
she
could
steer
as
well
as
a
boy
down
the
long
street
they
shot
from
one
patch
of
light
into
another
as
they
passed
the
lamp
posts
the
mothers
shrieked
with
excitement
and
held
on
for
dear
life
oh
panted
brewster
when
they
came
to
a
standstill
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
is
there
anything
in
the
world
half
so
exciting
and
delightful
as
coasting
down
they
went
again
and
again
laughing
all
the
way
and
causing
many
another
bobload
to
look
around
and
wonder
who
the
jolly
ladies
were
most
of
the
mothers
lost
their
breath
in
the
swift
rush
and
had
to
be
helped
up
the
hill
to
the
starting
point
once
sahwah
turned
too
short
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
and
upset
the
whole
sledful
into
a
deep
pile
of
snow
from
which
they
emerged
looking
like
snowmen
sputtered
brewster
the
snow
is
all
going
down
inside
of
my
collar
sarah
ann
you
wretch
you
deserve
to
have
your
face
washed
for
that
she
picked
up
a
great
lump
of
snow
and
hurled
it
deftly
at
sahwah
head
it
struck
its
mark
and
flew
all
to
pieces
much
of
it
going
down
the
back
of
her
neck
this
coasting
is
all
right
said
gardiner
but
oh
that
walk
up
hill
evans
spied
her
machine
standing
in
front
of
the
brewster
house
and
it
gave
her
an
idea
why
not
tie
the
bob
to
the
machine
she
said
and
go
for
a
regular
ride
this
suggestion
was
hailed
with
great
joy
and
carried
out
with
alacrity
would
you
like
to
drive
mother
asked
gladys
no
indeed
said
her
mother
i
out
you
get
in
and
drive
it
yourself
gladys
complied
with
migwan
up
beside
her
for
company
and
away
they
flew
up
one
street
and
down
another
and
through
the
park
and
just
as
they
were
going
around
a
curve
sahwah
who
sat
at
the
front
end
of
the
sled
untied
the
rope
and
away
went
the
machine
around
the
corner
and
left
them
stranded
in
the
snow
gladys
felt
the
release
of
the
trailer
but
pretended
that
she
knew
nothing
about
it
and
drove
ahead
at
full
speed
and
traveling
in
a
circle
came
up
behind
the
marooned
voyagers
and
surprised
them
with
a
hearty
laugh
this
time
she
towed
them
back
to
sahwah
house
where
they
drank
hot
cocoa
to
warm
themselves
up
and
all
declared
they
had
never
had
such
fun
in
their
lives
and
to
think
how
near
i
came
to
missing
this
said
evans
as
she
and
gladys
were
driving
home
and
she
shivered
when
she
remembered
how
she
had
almost
gone
to
the
musicale
chapter
vi
gladys
upholds
the
family
credit
evans
confided
her
plans
for
a
christmas
week
party
to
gladys
the
day
following
the
snow
frolic
and
gladys
was
delighted
with
the
idea
she
dearly
loved
to
entertain
her
friends
the
frock
was
ordered
from
new
york
and
evans
and
gladys
spent
long
hours
working
out
the
details
of
the
affair
rumors
of
the
party
and
the
dress
gladys
was
to
have
leaked
out
to
the
winnebagos
and
from
them
to
the
whole
class
every
one
was
on
tiptoe
to
find
out
who
would
be
invited
davis
and
jones
hearing
the
talk
about
the
coming
function
began
to
wonder
if
they
were
on
the
right
track
after
all
in
regard
to
the
evans
fortune
two
weeks
before
christmas
the
invitations
came
out
girls
and
boys
mostly
from
the
high
school
class
were
asked
what
a
flutter
of
satisfaction
there
was
among
those
who
had
been
invited
and
what
a
disappointment
among
those
who
had
not
been
and
what
consultations
about
dresses
among
the
favored
ones
this
question
was
an
acute
one
with
migwan
she
had
not
had
a
new
party
dress
for
several
years
and
in
the
present
state
of
their
finances
she
could
not
get
one
now
she
looked
at
the
old
one
faded
and
spotted
and
shook
her
head
despairingly
i
foresee
where
miss
migwan
develops
a
sudden
illness
on
the
night
of
the
party
she
said
with
tight
lips
unless
i
hear
from
my
story
in
time
as
if
in
answer
to
her
thoughts
the
story
came
back
the
very
next
day
there
was
no
letter
from
the
editor
concerning
the
merits
or
faults
of
the
piece
only
a
printed
rejection
slip
but
that
stated
that
only
typewritten
manuscripts
would
be
considered
migwan
air
castle
tumbled
about
her
ears
she
had
no
typewriter
and
knew
no
one
who
had
her
experience
did
not
include
a
knowledge
of
public
stenographers
and
even
if
she
had
thought
of
that
way
out
the
expense
would
have
prevented
her
from
having
her
story
copied
her
dream
of
fame
and
wealth
was
and
the
world
was
stale
flat
and
unprofitable
the
house
was
not
yet
rented
as
the
repairs
had
been
delayed
again
and
again
it
would
be
another
month
at
least
before
that
would
be
a
paying
proposition
hearing
the
other
girls
talk
about
gladys
party
all
the
time
filled
her
with
desperation
she
began
to
shun
the
winnebagos
the
keen
zest
went
out
of
her
studying
and
even
her
beloved
latin
lost
its
savor
nyoda
finally
noticed
it
migwan
failed
to
recite
in
english
class
for
two
days
in
succession
which
was
an
thing
nyoda
thought
that
migwan
had
her
head
so
full
of
the
coming
party
that
she
was
neglecting
her
lessons
and
said
so
half
banteringly
as
migwan
lingered
after
class
to
pick
up
some
papers
she
had
dropped
on
the
floor
that
was
the
last
straw
and
migwan
burst
into
tears
nyoda
was
all
sympathy
in
a
moment
now
nyoda
happened
to
have
the
seeing
eye
with
which
some
people
are
blessed
and
had
surmised
from
certain
little
signs
she
had
observed
that
migwan
had
written
something
or
other
and
sent
it
away
to
a
magazine
she
knew
only
too
well
what
the
outcome
would
be
and
her
heart
ached
when
she
thought
of
coming
disappointment
therefore
when
migwan
quickly
recovering
her
composure
said
calmly
it
nothing
nyoda
i
simply
tried
to
do
something
and
failed
nyoda
asked
quietly
did
your
story
come
back
migwan
looked
at
her
in
amazement
how
did
you
know
i
had
written
any
story
she
asked
oh
a
little
bird
told
me
replied
nyoda
lightly
cheer
up
all
the
famous
authors
had
their
first
work
rejected
you
have
achieved
the
first
mark
of
fame
migwan
smiled
wanly
her
tragedies
always
seemed
to
lose
their
sting
in
the
light
of
nyoda
optimism
she
told
her
about
the
necessity
for
a
typewriter
i
could
have
told
you
that
to
begin
with
if
you
had
asked
my
humble
advice
replied
nyoda
but
if
a
miserable
writing
machine
is
all
that
stands
between
you
and
fame
and
fortune
your
fortune
is
already
made
the
woman
whose
rooms
i
am
living
in
has
one
in
her
possession
it
belongs
to
her
son
i
believe
but
as
he
is
at
present
in
china
there
is
no
danger
of
his
wanting
it
for
some
time
she
has
offered
to
let
me
use
it
on
several
occasions
and
i
doubt
but
what
we
can
make
some
arrangement
to
accommodate
you
the
world
seemed
a
pretty
good
place
of
habitation
after
all
to
migwan
that
day
when
she
went
home
from
school
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
no
dress
to
wear
to
the
party
the
situation
began
to
appear
faintly
humorous
to
her
here
was
all
the
interest
centered
on
what
gladys
was
going
to
wear
when
all
the
time
the
real
vital
question
was
what
was
going
to
wear
what
a
commotion
there
would
be
if
the
other
winnebagos
knew
the
truth
her
thoughts
began
to
beat
themselves
into
rhythm
as
she
walked
home
through
the
crunching
snow
broke
broke
broke
and
such
clothes
in
the
windows
i
see
and
i
would
that
my
purse
could
answer
the
demands
that
are
made
on
she
o
well
for
the
millionaire
wife
who
can
pay
eighty
bones
for
a
shawl
and
well
for
the
african
maids
who
do
need
any
clothes
at
all
and
the
pennies
they
all
go
to
the
grocer
and
so
do
the
dimes
but
o
for
the
little
crepe
meteor
dress
i
saw
down
in
oppenheim
broke
broke
broke
and
such
styles
in
the
windows
i
see
what
would
i
not
give
for
the
rest
of
the
month
for
the
salary
of
john
d
would
you
just
as
soon
run
up
to
the
attic
and
get
the
blanket
sheets
out
of
the
trunk
asked
her
mother
when
she
had
finished
her
dinner
i
was
cold
in
bed
last
night
migwan
went
up
promptly
she
found
the
sheets
and
laid
them
out
and
was
then
seized
with
a
desire
to
rummage
among
the
things
in
the
trunk
she
pawed
over
old
valentines
bonnets
of
a
day
lace
mitts
and
all
the
useless
relics
that
are
usually
found
in
mother
trunk
that
had
been
mother
down
at
the
bottom
however
there
was
a
paper
package
of
considerable
size
migwan
opened
it
carefully
and
brought
to
view
a
dress
made
of
white
brocaded
satin
yellowed
with
age
a
sudden
inspiration
struck
her
and
laying
it
carefully
on
top
of
the
blankets
she
ran
downstairs
to
her
mother
what
is
this
dress
she
asked
eagerly
gardiner
face
lighted
tenderly
when
she
saw
it
why
that
my
wedding
dress
she
said
oh
said
migwan
in
a
disappointed
tone
laying
the
dress
down
what
did
you
want
with
it
asked
her
mother
why
i
thought
if
it
was
just
a
dress
replied
migwan
i
could
make
it
over
to
wear
to
gladys
party
but
of
course
if
it
is
your
wedding
dress
you
would
care
to
have
it
changed
i
do
see
why
not
said
gardiner
it
no
good
as
it
is
never
had
it
on
since
my
wedding
day
the
material
in
that
dress
cost
two
dollars
a
yard
and
is
better
than
what
you
get
at
that
price
nowadays
a
sudden
recollection
illumined
her
face
the
night
of
the
party
is
my
wedding
anniversary
she
said
there
could
be
a
better
occasion
to
wear
it
would
you
really
be
willing
to
have
me
cut
it
up
asked
migwan
rapturously
clasping
her
hands
that
afternoon
her
head
really
was
so
full
of
party
plans
that
she
forgot
to
get
her
lessons
the
dress
was
laid
out
on
the
dining
room
table
and
examined
as
to
its
possibilities
i
do
know
but
what
it
would
be
best
to
dye
it
some
pretty
shade
of
green
or
blue
said
gardiner
after
thinking
the
matter
over
it
is
too
yellow
to
use
as
it
is
and
there
is
no
time
to
bleach
it
properly
so
it
was
ripped
up
and
dyed
nile
green
a
shade
which
was
particularly
becoming
to
migwan
there
was
enough
goods
in
the
train
to
make
the
entire
dress
so
there
was
no
need
to
do
any
piecing
instead
of
avoiding
the
subject
of
the
party
migwan
now
joined
happily
in
the
discussions
and
asked
questions
right
and
left
about
the
best
style
in
which
to
make
her
dress
she
said
nothing
about
the
former
function
of
that
particular
piece
of
goods
extravagant
migwan
said
sahwah
getting
a
satin
dress
for
the
party
my
mother
made
me
get
silk
poplin
gladys
dress
had
arrived
from
new
york
but
she
would
not
breathe
a
word
in
regard
to
it
and
the
girls
were
wild
with
curiosity
only
hinpoha
was
allowed
to
behold
its
glories
as
a
consolation
for
not
being
able
to
come
to
the
party
of
course
hinpoha
had
been
sworn
to
secrecy
regarding
it
but
that
did
not
keep
her
from
rhapsodizing
about
it
on
general
principles
and
pitching
the
girls
curiosity
still
higher
now
there
was
one
girl
who
had
been
invited
to
the
party
who
said
very
little
about
it
this
was
emily
meeks
who
sat
beside
gladys
in
the
session
room
emily
had
also
entered
the
class
this
fall
but
unlike
gladys
her
path
had
not
been
marked
by
triumphs
she
was
timid
and
retiring
and
after
being
three
months
in
the
class
was
little
better
known
than
she
had
been
at
first
the
truth
was
that
emily
was
an
orphan
working
her
way
through
high
school
by
taking
care
of
the
children
of
one
of
the
professors
after
school
hours
and
had
neither
money
nor
time
to
spend
in
the
company
of
her
classmates
gladys
was
sorry
for
her
because
she
always
looked
so
sad
and
lonely
and
thinking
to
give
her
one
good
time
at
least
to
treasure
up
in
the
memory
of
her
school
days
invited
her
to
the
party
emily
accepted
the
invitation
gratefully
the
night
of
the
party
came
at
last
migwan
dress
was
finished
and
when
she
was
finally
arrayed
in
it
she
could
compare
favorably
with
the
wealthiest
girl
in
the
crowd
she
even
wore
her
mother
white
satin
wedding
slippers
with
the
little
gold
buckles
which
fitted
her
perfectly
she
skipped
away
happily
with
a
kiss
to
her
mother
who
was
tired
out
with
her
labors
gladys
had
relented
at
the
last
minute
and
promised
the
winnebagos
that
if
they
would
come
a
half
hour
early
they
might
help
her
dress
that
was
because
the
winnebagos
were
closer
kin
to
her
than
the
rest
of
the
girls
and
it
would
be
a
shame
to
have
any
one
else
see
the
dress
first
so
they
all
gathered
in
gladys
room
where
the
dress
lay
on
the
bed
it
was
of
light
blue
chiffon
exquisitely
hand
embroidered
in
butterflies
they
gasped
not
daring
to
touch
it
there
goes
the
bell
exclaimed
gladys
and
i
not
even
dressed
some
of
the
boys
i
hear
their
voices
she
said
presently
after
listening
for
the
sounds
from
below
run
down
will
you
girls
and
entertain
them
until
i
come
the
winnebagos
departed
to
act
the
part
of
hostesses
for
their
friend
and
gladys
got
hurriedly
into
her
dress
before
she
was
ready
to
go
down
she
heard
a
large
group
of
girls
arriving
then
another
delegation
of
boys
the
orchestra
had
begun
playing
gladys
foot
tapped
the
floor
in
time
to
the
music
as
she
fastened
up
the
dress
just
wait
until
they
see
me
dance
the
butterfly
dance
she
was
thinking
with
innocent
pride
she
clasped
the
butterflies
on
her
shoulders
in
place
and
with
a
last
survey
of
herself
in
the
glass
she
set
forth
to
greet
her
guests
when
she
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
the
bell
rang
again
and
she
paused
to
see
who
it
was
from
the
hall
upstairs
she
could
get
a
view
of
the
entire
reception
room
without
being
seen
herself
the
last
comer
was
emily
meeks
whom
the
maid
was
relieving
of
her
wraps
she
was
all
alone
apparently
at
a
loss
what
to
do
in
company
and
dressed
in
a
white
skirt
and
middy
blouse
gladys
could
see
the
coldly
amused
glances
some
of
the
girls
were
bestowing
on
her
and
the
indifference
with
which
she
was
being
treated
by
the
boys
why
did
she
come
dressed
in
such
a
fashion
gladys
felt
a
little
indignant
at
her
then
she
reflected
that
emily
probably
had
nothing
else
to
wear
and
besides
it
did
make
any
difference
if
one
was
dressed
so
plainly
there
were
enough
brightly
dressed
girls
to
make
the
brilliant
scene
that
she
loved
but
at
the
same
time
a
thought
struck
her
which
made
her
decidedly
uncomfortable
it
was
how
would
you
like
to
be
the
odd
one
in
the
crowd
and
have
all
the
others
take
notice
of
you
because
you
match
your
surroundings
to
face
a
battery
of
eyes
that
were
amused
or
scornful
or
pitying
according
to
the
disposition
of
the
owner
of
the
eyes
to
feel
lonesome
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
and
wish
you
were
miles
away
with
one
foot
on
the
top
step
gladys
hesitated
in
her
mind
there
rose
a
picture
the
picture
of
her
first
night
in
camp
when
she
had
seen
a
camp
fire
ceremonial
for
the
first
time
when
she
felt
lonesome
and
far
away
and
out
of
place
again
she
saw
the
figures
circling
around
the
fire
and
heard
the
words
of
their
song
whose
hand
above
this
blaze
is
lifted
shall
be
with
magic
touch
engifted
to
warm
the
hearts
of
lonely
mortals
who
stand
without
their
open
portals
whoso
shall
stand
by
this
hearthstone
flame
fanned
shall
never
stand
alone
and
later
the
flame
had
been
given
into
her
keeping
and
she
was
supposed
to
possess
the
magic
touch
to
warm
lonely
hearts
she
glanced
at
herself
in
the
long
mirror
in
the
hall
and
was
struck
afresh
by
the
beauty
of
the
dress
the
shade
of
blue
was
just
the
right
one
to
bring
out
the
tint
of
her
eyes
and
the
gold
of
her
hair
from
head
to
foot
she
was
a
vision
of
loveliness
such
as
delighted
her
dainty
nature
one
interpretation
of
seek
beauty
was
to
always
dress
as
beautifully
and
becomingly
as
possible
her
mother
was
impatiently
waiting
for
her
to
come
down
and
show
herself
then
she
looked
over
the
railing
again
emily
meeks
had
withdrawn
from
the
groups
of
laughing
girls
and
boys
and
had
crept
into
a
corner
by
herself
the
words
of
the
fire
song
echoed
again
in
her
ears
shall
stand
by
this
hearthstone
flame
fanned
shall
never
stand
alone
gladys
turned
and
fled
to
her
room
and
resolutely
began
to
unclasp
the
fasteners
of
her
butterfly
dress
a
ripple
of
astonishment
went
through
the
rooms
downstairs
when
she
descended
clad
in
a
white
linen
skirt
and
a
middy
blouse
all
the
girls
had
heard
about
the
dress
from
new
york
and
were
impatient
to
see
it
frances
jones
and
caroline
davis
stood
right
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
waiting
for
gladys
to
come
down
so
they
would
not
lose
a
detail
of
it
and
evans
was
watching
them
to
see
what
effect
the
butterfly
dress
would
have
on
them
when
gladys
came
down
dressed
in
a
white
skirt
and
middy
she
could
not
believe
her
eyes
she
hurried
forward
and
asked
in
a
low
voice
what
was
the
matter
with
the
new
dress
nothing
mother
said
gladys
sweetly
with
such
a
beautiful
smile
that
her
mother
dropped
back
in
perplexity
gladys
advanced
straight
to
emily
meeks
and
greeted
her
first
of
all
with
a
friendly
cordiality
that
put
her
at
her
ease
at
once
emily
who
had
been
dismayed
when
she
found
herself
so
conspicuous
among
all
the
brightly
gowned
girls
was
reassured
when
she
saw
gladys
similarly
clad
and
never
found
out
about
that
quick
change
of
costume
that
had
taken
place
after
her
coming
the
other
girls
of
course
understood
this
fine
little
act
of
courtesy
and
shamefacedly
began
to
include
emily
in
their
conversation
and
merrymaking
so
if
evans
had
counted
on
gladys
dress
that
night
to
testify
to
the
soundness
of
the
evans
fortune
she
was
destined
to
be
disappointed
but
on
the
other
hand
if
inborn
courtesy
is
a
sign
of
high
birth
and
breeding
then
gladys
had
proven
herself
to
be
a
princess
of
the
royal
blood
chapter
vii
hard
times
for
poets
true
to
her
word
nyoda
brought
it
about
that
migwan
might
use
the
typewriter
which
belonged
to
her
landlady
and
every
evening
after
her
lessons
were
learned
she
worked
diligently
to
master
the
keys
in
a
week
or
so
she
managed
to
copy
her
story
and
sent
it
out
again
it
came
back
as
promptly
as
before
with
the
same
kind
of
rejection
slip
she
sent
it
to
another
magazine
and
began
writing
a
new
one
she
worked
feverishly
and
far
beyond
her
strength
the
room
where
the
typewriter
was
was
directly
below
nyoda
sitting
room
and
hearing
the
machine
still
rattling
after
ten
one
night
she
calmly
walked
in
and
pulled
migwan
away
from
the
keys
migwan
protested
it
past
closing
time
said
nyoda
firmly
but
i
must
finish
this
page
said
migwan
you
must
nothing
of
the
kind
said
nyoda
forcing
migwan
into
her
coat
on
to
health
does
not
mean
work
yourself
to
death
hereafter
you
stop
writing
at
nine
or
i
will
take
the
typewriter
away
from
you
oh
may
i
stay
until
half
past
nine
asked
migwan
coaxingly
no
ma
said
nyoda
emphatically
nine
is
the
time
that
a
bargain
as
long
as
you
keep
your
part
of
it
you
may
use
the
typewriter
but
as
soon
as
you
step
over
the
line
i
go
back
on
my
part
now
remember
checkee
no
shirtee
and
migwan
perforce
had
to
submit
the
stories
came
back
as
fast
as
they
were
sent
out
and
migwan
began
to
have
new
sidelights
on
the
charmed
life
supposedly
led
by
authors
and
authoresses
the
struggle
to
get
along
without
getting
into
debt
was
becoming
an
acute
one
with
the
gardiner
family
tom
delivered
papers
during
the
week
and
helped
out
in
a
grocery
store
on
saturday
and
his
earnings
helped
slightly
but
not
much
midwinter
taxes
on
two
houses
ate
up
more
than
two
weeks
income
with
almost
superhuman
ingenuity
migwan
apportioned
their
expenses
so
the
money
covered
them
this
she
had
to
do
practically
alone
for
her
mother
was
as
helpless
before
a
column
of
figures
as
she
would
have
been
in
a
flood
meat
practically
disappeared
from
the
table
the
big
bag
of
nuts
which
tom
had
gathered
in
the
fall
and
which
they
had
thought
of
only
as
a
treat
to
pass
around
in
the
evening
now
became
a
prominent
part
of
the
menu
dried
peas
and
beans
boiled
and
made
into
soup
made
their
appearance
on
the
table
several
times
a
week
cornbread
was
another
standby
long
years
afterward
migwan
would
shudder
at
the
sight
of
either
bean
soup
or
cornbread
she
nearly
wore
out
the
cook
book
looking
for
new
ways
in
which
to
serve
potatoes
squash
turnips
onions
and
parsnips
she
soon
discovered
that
most
provisions
could
be
bought
a
few
cents
cheaper
in
the
market
than
in
the
stores
so
every
saturday
afternoon
she
made
a
trip
downtown
with
a
big
market
basket
and
bought
the
supply
of
butter
eggs
and
vegetables
at
first
the
necessity
for
spending
carfare
cut
into
her
profits
but
she
got
around
this
in
an
adroit
way
that
promised
well
for
her
future
ability
to
handle
her
affairs
to
the
best
advantage
she
tried
a
little
publicity
work
to
swing
things
around
to
suit
her
purpose
she
simply
exalted
the
joys
of
marketing
until
the
other
winnebagos
were
crazy
to
do
the
family
marketing
too
as
soon
as
gladys
caught
the
fever
her
object
was
accomplished
for
gladys
took
all
the
girls
to
market
in
her
big
car
and
brought
all
their
purchases
home
so
migwan
accomplished
her
own
ends
and
gave
the
winnebagos
a
new
opportunity
to
pursue
knowledge
at
the
same
time
at
christmas
time
she
had
also
fallen
back
on
her
ingenuity
to
produce
the
gifts
she
wished
to
give
there
was
no
money
at
all
to
be
spent
for
this
purpose
migwan
took
a
careful
stock
of
the
resources
of
the
house
the
only
promising
thing
she
found
was
a
leather
skin
which
hinpoha
had
given
her
the
summer
before
for
helping
her
write
up
the
weekly
count
in
hiawatha
meter
which
was
outside
of
hinpoha
range
of
talents
she
considered
the
possibilities
of
that
skin
carefully
it
must
yield
seven
articles
a
present
for
each
of
the
winnebagos
she
decided
on
book
covers
she
wrote
up
seven
different
incidents
of
the
summer
camping
trip
in
verse
and
copied
them
with
the
typewriter
on
rough
yellow
drawing
paper
thinking
to
decorate
each
sheet
but
migwan
had
little
artistic
ability
and
soon
saw
that
her
decorations
were
not
beautiful
enough
to
adorn
christmas
gifts
after
spoiling
several
pages
she
gave
up
in
disgust
and
threw
the
spoiled
pages
into
the
grate
the
next
morning
she
was
cleaning
out
the
grate
and
found
the
pieces
of
paper
only
partially
burned
around
the
edges
she
suddenly
had
an
idea
the
fire
had
burned
a
neat
and
artistic
brown
border
around
the
writing
why
not
burn
all
her
sheets
around
the
edges
accordingly
she
set
to
work
with
a
candle
and
in
a
short
time
had
her
pages
decorated
in
an
odd
and
original
way
which
could
not
fail
to
appeal
to
a
camp
fire
girl
then
she
pasted
the
irregular
pieces
of
yellow
paper
on
straight
pages
of
heavy
brown
paper
which
brought
out
the
burned
edges
beautifully
on
the
cover
of
each
book
she
painted
the
symbol
of
the
girl
for
whom
it
was
intended
and
on
the
inside
of
the
back
cover
she
painted
her
own
the
winnebagos
were
delighted
with
the
books
and
took
greater
pride
in
showing
them
to
their
friends
than
they
did
their
more
expensive
presents
that
piece
of
ingenuity
was
bread
cast
on
the
water
for
migwan
nyoda
came
to
her
one
day
while
she
was
working
her
head
off
on
the
typewriter
could
the
authoress
be
persuaded
to
desist
from
her
labors
for
a
while
she
asked
tiptoeing
around
the
room
in
a
ridiculous
effort
to
be
quiet
which
convulsed
migwan
speak
said
migwan
your
wish
is
already
granted
nyoda
sat
down
you
remember
that
cunning
little
book
you
made
me
for
christmas
she
asked
migwan
nodded
well
continued
nyoda
i
was
showing
it
to
professor
green
the
other
night
and
he
was
quite
carried
away
with
it
he
has
a
quantity
of
notes
he
took
on
a
hunting
trip
last
fall
and
wants
to
know
if
you
will
make
them
into
a
book
like
that
for
him
there
will
be
quite
a
bit
of
work
connected
with
it
as
all
the
material
will
have
to
be
copied
on
the
typewriter
and
arranged
in
good
order
and
he
is
willing
to
pay
two
and
a
half
dollars
for
your
services
would
you
be
willing
to
do
it
would
she
be
willing
to
do
it
would
she
see
two
and
a
half
dollars
lying
in
the
street
and
not
pick
it
up
the
professor
notes
were
speedily
secured
and
she
set
to
work
happily
to
transform
them
into
an
artistic
record
book
her
sister
betty
grumbled
a
good
deal
these
days
because
she
was
asked
to
do
so
much
of
the
housework
before
migwan
took
to
typewriting
at
night
betty
had
been
in
the
habit
of
staying
out
of
the
house
until
supper
was
ready
and
then
getting
up
from
the
table
and
going
out
again
immediately
leaving
migwan
to
get
supper
and
wash
the
dishes
it
was
easier
to
do
the
work
herself
than
to
argue
with
betty
about
it
and
if
she
appealed
to
her
mother
gardiner
always
said
just
leave
the
dishes
and
i
do
them
alone
so
rather
than
have
her
mother
do
them
migwan
generally
washed
and
wiped
them
alone
but
now
that
she
was
working
so
hard
she
needed
the
whole
afternoon
to
get
her
lessons
in
and
insisted
that
betty
should
help
get
supper
and
wipe
dishes
afterwards
for
once
gardiner
took
sides
with
migwan
and
commanded
betty
to
do
her
share
of
the
work
in
consequence
betty
developed
a
fierce
resentment
against
migwan
literary
efforts
and
taunted
her
continually
with
her
failure
to
make
anything
of
it
since
she
had
been
working
on
professor
green
book
migwan
had
done
nothing
at
all
in
the
house
and
her
usual
saturday
work
fell
to
betty
gardiner
was
not
feeling
well
of
late
and
could
do
no
sweeping
so
betty
found
herself
with
a
good
day
work
ahead
of
her
one
saturday
morning
instead
of
playing
that
the
dirt
was
a
host
of
evil
sprits
as
migwan
did
which
she
could
vanquish
with
the
aid
of
her
magic
broom
betty
went
at
it
sullenly
and
with
a
firm
determination
to
do
as
little
as
possible
and
get
through
just
as
quickly
as
she
could
she
made
up
her
mind
that
when
migwan
went
to
market
in
the
afternoon
she
would
go
along
with
her
in
the
automobile
so
by
going
hastily
over
the
surface
of
things
she
got
through
by
three
and
when
gladys
called
for
migwan
betty
came
running
out
too
with
her
coat
and
hat
on
dressed
in
her
best
dress
where
are
you
going
asked
migwan
along
with
you
answered
betty
i
afraid
we
ca
take
you
said
migwan
there
is
enough
room
oh
i
squeeze
in
said
betty
lightly
now
seven
girls
with
market
baskets
in
addition
to
the
driver
are
somewhat
of
a
crowd
and
there
really
was
no
room
for
betty
in
the
machine
besides
betty
was
a
great
tease
and
the
girls
dreaded
to
have
her
with
them
so
no
one
said
a
word
of
encouragement
you
ca
come
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
said
migwan
rather
crossly
she
was
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
and
get
the
marketing
done
betty
stamped
her
foot
and
snatching
migwan
market
basket
she
ran
around
the
corner
of
the
house
with
it
migwan
ran
after
her
and
forcibly
recovering
the
basket
hit
betty
over
the
head
with
it
several
times
then
she
jumped
into
the
automobile
and
the
driver
started
off
leaving
betty
standing
looking
after
the
rapidly
disappearing
car
and
working
herself
into
a
terrible
temper
she
ran
into
the
house
and
slammed
the
door
with
such
a
jar
that
the
vases
on
the
mantel
rattled
and
threatened
to
fall
down
she
threw
her
hat
and
coat
on
the
floor
and
stamped
on
them
in
a
perfect
fury
on
the
sitting
room
table
lay
the
pages
of
the
book
which
migwan
was
making
for
professor
green
the
edges
were
already
burned
and
they
were
ready
to
be
pasted
on
the
brown
mat
betty
eyes
suddenly
snapped
when
she
saw
them
here
was
a
fine
chance
to
be
revenged
on
migwan
with
an
exclamation
of
triumph
she
seized
the
leaves
tore
them
in
half
and
threw
them
into
the
grate
standing
by
until
they
were
consumed
to
ashes
and
laughing
spitefully
the
while
migwan
came
in
briskly
with
her
basket
of
provisions
betty
looked
up
slyly
from
the
book
she
was
reading
but
said
not
a
word
migwan
went
into
the
sitting
room
and
betty
heard
her
moving
around
mother
called
migwan
up
the
stairway
where
did
you
put
the
pages
of
my
book
i
left
them
on
the
sitting
room
table
i
did
touch
them
replied
her
mother
i
have
been
downstairs
since
you
went
out
betty
said
migwan
sternly
did
you
hide
my
work
betty
laughed
mockingly
but
made
no
reply
make
haste
and
give
them
back
commanded
migwan
i
have
no
time
to
waste
betty
still
maintained
a
provoking
silence
and
migwan
began
looking
through
the
table
drawers
for
the
missing
leaves
betty
watched
her
with
malicious
glee
you
may
look
a
while
before
you
find
them
she
said
meaningly
they
hidden
in
a
nice
safe
place
migwan
stood
and
faced
her
exasperated
beyond
endurance
betty
gardiner
she
said
angrily
stop
this
nonsense
at
once
and
tell
me
where
those
pages
are
well
if
you
really
curious
to
know
answered
betty
smiling
wickedly
i
tell
you
they
and
she
pointed
to
the
grate
betty
gasped
migwan
turning
white
you
do
mean
that
burned
them
that
what
i
do
mean
said
betty
coolly
i
show
you
if
you
can
treat
me
like
a
baby
migwan
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
she
could
hardly
believe
that
those
fair
pages
which
represented
so
many
hours
of
patient
work
had
been
swept
away
in
one
moment
of
passion
blindly
she
turned
and
putting
on
her
wraps
walked
from
the
house
without
a
word
it
seemed
to
her
that
fate
had
decreed
that
nothing
which
she
undertook
should
succeed
discouragement
settled
down
on
her
like
a
black
pall
with
the
ability
to
do
things
which
should
set
her
above
her
fellows
she
was
being
relentlessly
pursued
by
some
strange
fatality
which
marked
every
effort
of
hers
a
failure
she
walked
aimlessly
up
street
after
street
without
any
idea
where
she
was
going
entirely
oblivious
to
her
surroundings
wandering
thus
she
discovered
that
she
was
in
the
park
and
had
come
out
on
the
high
bluff
of
the
lake
she
stood
moodily
looking
down
at
the
vast
field
of
ice
that
such
a
short
time
before
had
been
tossing
waves
the
lake
to
all
appearances
was
frozen
solid
out
as
far
as
the
crib
there
was
a
curious
stillness
in
the
air
as
when
the
clock
had
stopped
due
to
the
absence
of
the
noise
made
by
the
waves
dashing
on
the
rocks
nothing
had
ever
appealed
so
to
migwan
as
did
the
absolute
silence
and
solitude
of
that
frozen
lake
her
bruised
young
spirit
was
weary
of
contact
with
people
and
found
balm
in
this
icy
desert
where
there
was
so
sound
of
a
human
voice
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
there
was
not
a
living
being
in
sight
a
skating
carnival
in
the
other
end
of
the
park
drew
the
attention
of
all
who
were
abroad
on
this
saturday
afternoon
and
kept
them
away
from
the
lake
front
a
desire
to
be
enveloped
in
this
solitude
came
over
migwan
to
get
her
feet
off
the
earth
altogether
she
half
slid
and
half
climbed
down
the
cliff
and
walked
out
on
the
ice
before
her
the
grey
horizon
line
stretched
vast
and
unbroken
and
she
walked
out
toward
it
lost
in
dreaming
sometimes
the
floor
under
her
feet
was
smooth
and
polished
as
a
pane
of
glass
and
sometimes
it
was
rough
and
covered
with
hummocks
where
the
water
had
frozen
in
the
wind
in
migwan
fancy
this
was
not
the
lake
she
was
walking
on
it
was
one
of
the
great
swiss
glaciers
those
grey
clouds
there
standing
out
against
the
black
ones
they
were
the
mountains
and
she
was
taking
her
perilous
journey
through
the
mountain
pass
the
ice
cracked
slightly
under
her
feet
but
she
did
not
notice
she
was
a
swiss
guide
taking
a
party
of
tourists
across
the
glacier
underneath
this
floor
of
ice
were
the
bodies
of
those
travelers
who
had
fallen
into
the
crevices
she
was
telling
the
tourists
the
stories
of
the
famous
disasters
and
they
were
shuddering
at
her
tale
the
ice
cracked
again
under
her
feet
but
her
mind
soaring
in
flights
of
fancy
took
no
heed
her
imagination
took
another
turn
now
she
was
knollys
in
the
famous
story
waiting
for
the
body
of
her
husband
to
be
given
up
by
the
glacier
the
long
years
of
waiting
passed
and
she
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
glacier
watching
the
miracle
unfold
before
her
eyes
the
glacier
was
making
queer
cracking
noises
as
it
descended
and
it
sounded
as
though
there
was
water
underneath
it
she
could
hear
it
lapping
a
sound
rang
out
on
the
still
air
that
startled
migwan
like
the
report
of
a
pistol
followed
immediately
by
another
she
came
to
her
senses
with
a
rush
with
hardly
a
moment
warning
the
ice
on
which
she
was
standing
broke
away
from
the
main
mass
and
began
to
move
struck
motionless
by
fright
she
had
not
the
presence
of
mind
to
jump
back
to
the
larger
field
a
wave
washed
in
between
separating
her
by
several
feet
from
the
solid
ice
the
cake
she
was
on
began
to
heave
and
fall
sickeningly
there
was
another
cracking
sound
and
the
edge
of
the
solid
body
of
ice
broke
up
into
dozens
of
floating
cakes
that
ground
and
pounded
each
other
as
the
waves
set
them
in
motion
every
drop
of
blood
receded
from
migwan
heart
as
she
realized
what
had
happened
she
screamed
aloud
once
and
then
knew
the
futility
of
it
her
voice
could
not
reach
to
the
shore
lake
and
sky
and
horizon
line
now
mocked
her
with
their
silence
the
cake
of
ice
lurching
and
tipping
began
floating
out
to
sea
on
this
wintry
afternoon
sahwah
left
the
house
in
a
far
different
mood
from
that
which
had
carried
migwan
blindly
over
the
ground
her
eyes
were
sparkling
with
the
joy
of
life
and
her
cheeks
were
glowing
in
the
cold
she
wore
a
heavy
reefer
sweater
and
a
knitted
cap
under
her
arm
was
her
latest
plaything
a
pair
of
skis
by
her
side
walked
dick
albright
one
of
the
boys
in
her
class
whom
she
considered
especially
good
fun
dick
also
had
a
pair
of
skis
the
two
of
them
were
bound
for
the
park
to
practice
making
descents
from
the
hillsides
sahwah
was
absolutely
happy
and
chattered
like
one
of
the
sparrows
that
were
flocking
on
the
lawns
and
streets
her
chief
interest
in
life
just
now
was
the
school
basketball
team
of
which
she
was
a
member
soon
very
soon
would
come
the
big
game
with
the
carnegie
mechanics
which
would
decide
the
championship
of
the
city
sahwah
was
the
star
forward
for
the
washington
high
team
and
it
was
no
secret
that
the
winning
of
that
game
depended
upon
her
to
a
great
extent
sahwah
was
the
idol
of
the
athletically
inclined
portion
of
the
school
dick
thought
there
never
was
such
a
player
for
a
girl
sahwah
was
full
of
basketball
talk
now
and
made
shrewd
comments
on
the
good
and
bad
points
of
both
teams
weighing
the
chances
of
each
with
great
care
mechanicals
center
is
shorter
than
ours
we
have
the
advantage
there
one
of
their
forwards
is
good
and
the
other
is
and
one
of
our
guards
is
weak
on
the
whole
we
about
evenly
matched
fine
chance
mechanicals
have
with
you
in
the
game
said
dick
the
only
thing
i
afraid
of
said
sahwah
with
a
thoughtful
pucker
is
marie
lanning
you
know
joe
lanning
cousin
she
to
guard
me
and
she
a
head
taller
do
worry
you
manage
all
right
said
dick
sahwah
laughed
it
was
pleasant
to
be
looked
up
to
as
the
hope
of
the
school
if
you
only
do
get
sick
said
dick
do
be
afraid
answered
sahwah
i
wo
get
sick
but
if
i
get
my
physics
notebook
finished
by
the
first
of
february
i
not
be
eligible
for
the
game
and
that
no
joke
fizzy
said
nobody
would
get
a
passing
grade
this
month
who
did
have
that
old
notebook
finished
and
you
know
what
that
means
there
really
is
any
danger
of
your
not
getting
it
in
is
there
asked
dick
breathlessly
not
if
i
keep
at
it
answered
sahwah
and
dick
breathed
easy
again
to
allow
yourself
to
be
declared
ineligible
for
a
game
on
account
of
studies
when
the
school
was
depending
on
you
to
win
that
game
would
have
been
a
crime
too
awful
to
contemplate
the
snow
on
the
hills
in
the
park
had
a
hard
crust
which
made
it
just
right
for
skiing
sahwah
and
dick
made
one
descent
after
another
sometimes
tripping
over
the
point
of
a
ski
and
landing
in
a
sprawling
heap
but
more
often
sailing
down
in
perfect
form
with
a
breathless
rush
that
last
leap
of
yours
was
a
beauty
said
sahwah
admiringly
i
think
i
learning
said
dick
modestly
i
you
to
go
down
the
big
hill
on
the
lake
front
said
sahwah
her
eyes
sparkling
with
mischief
dick
knew
what
that
particular
hill
was
like
but
boylike
he
could
not
refuse
a
dare
given
by
a
girl
do
you
want
to
see
me
do
it
he
said
stoutly
all
right
i
will
do
said
sahwah
frightened
at
what
she
had
driven
him
to
do
you
break
your
neck
i
did
really
mean
to
dare
you
to
do
it
but
dick
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
down
that
cliff
hill
just
to
show
sahwah
that
he
could
and
nothing
could
turn
him
aside
now
come
along
he
said
i
can
make
it
and
he
started
off
toward
the
lake
front
at
a
brisk
pace
but
when
he
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
in
question
he
stood
still
and
stared
out
over
the
lake
hello
he
said
in
surprise
somebody
having
trouble
out
there
on
the
ice
sahwah
came
and
stood
beside
him
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
to
see
what
was
happening
at
that
distance
she
did
not
recognize
migwan
the
ice
is
breaking
cried
dick
who
was
and
saw
the
girl
on
the
floating
ice
cake
like
a
whirlwind
he
sped
down
the
hillside
dropped
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
like
a
plummet
and
shot
nearly
a
hundred
feet
out
over
the
glassy
surface
of
the
lake
without
pausing
an
instant
sahwah
was
after
him
she
had
a
dizzy
sensation
of
falling
off
the
earth
when
she
made
the
jump
from
the
hillside
which
was
a
greater
distance
than
she
had
ever
dropped
before
but
it
was
over
so
quickly
that
she
had
no
time
to
lose
her
breath
before
she
was
on
solid
ground
again
and
taking
the
long
slide
over
the
lake
in
a
short
time
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
broken
ice
migwan
gasped
sahwah
when
she
saw
who
the
girl
on
the
floating
cake
was
they
could
not
get
very
near
her
as
the
edge
of
the
solid
mass
was
continually
breaking
away
and
there
was
a
strip
of
moving
pieces
between
them
and
her
fasten
the
skis
together
and
make
a
long
pole
said
sahwah
and
then
she
can
take
hold
of
one
end
of
it
and
we
can
pull
her
toward
us
said
sahwah
good
idea
said
dick
and
proceeded
to
lash
the
long
strips
together
with
the
straps
aided
by
sundry
strings
and
handkerchiefs
then
there
were
several
moments
of
suspense
until
migwan
came
within
reach
of
the
pole
she
simply
had
to
wait
until
she
floated
near
enough
to
grasp
it
which
the
perverse
ice
cake
seemed
to
have
no
intention
of
doing
the
right
combination
of
wind
and
wave
came
at
last
however
and
drove
her
in
toward
the
shore
she
was
still
beyond
the
end
of
the
pole
jump
onto
the
next
cake
called
sahwah
migwan
obeyed
in
fear
and
trembling
it
took
still
another
jump
before
she
could
reach
the
lifesaver
she
was
now
separated
from
the
broken
mass
at
the
edge
of
the
solid
ice
by
about
six
feet
with
migwan
clinging
fast
to
the
pole
dick
began
to
pull
in
gently
so
as
not
to
pull
her
off
the
ice
and
the
cake
began
to
move
across
this
open
space
until
it
was
close
beside
the
nearer
mass
of
broken
pieces
then
supported
by
the
improvised
hand
rail
migwan
leaped
from
one
cake
to
the
next
and
so
made
her
way
back
to
the
solid
part
it
was
an
exciting
process
for
the
pieces
tipped
and
heaved
when
she
stepped
on
them
and
bobbed
up
and
down
and
some
turned
over
just
as
her
feet
left
them
eliza
crossing
the
ice
said
sahwah
giggling
nervously
migwan
sank
down
exhausted
when
she
felt
the
solid
mass
under
her
feet
and
knew
that
the
danger
was
over
she
was
chilled
through
and
through
and
more
than
one
wave
had
splashed
over
the
floating
ice
while
she
was
on
it
and
soaked
her
shoes
and
stockings
sahwah
took
this
in
at
a
glance
get
up
she
said
sharply
and
run
run
all
the
way
home
if
you
do
want
to
get
pneumonia
it
your
only
chance
taking
hold
of
her
hands
dick
and
sahwah
ran
along
beside
her
making
her
keep
up
the
pace
when
she
pleaded
fatigue
more
dead
than
alive
she
reached
home
but
warm
from
head
to
foot
sahwah
rolled
her
in
hot
blankets
and
administered
hot
drinks
with
a
practiced
hand
neither
gardiner
nor
betty
were
at
home
migwan
soon
dropped
off
to
sleep
and
woke
feeling
entirely
well
thanks
to
sahwah
taking
her
in
hand
she
emerged
from
the
experience
without
even
a
sign
of
a
cold
with
heroic
patience
and
courage
she
began
again
the
weary
task
of
typing
and
burning
all
the
pages
of
professor
green
book
and
finished
it
this
time
without
mishap
the
money
she
received
for
it
all
went
into
the
family
purse
not
a
cent
did
she
spend
on
herself
not
long
after
this
migwan
had
a
taste
of
fame
she
had
a
poem
printed
in
the
paper
it
happened
in
this
way
at
the
sunbeam
nursery
one
morning
nyoda
saw
her
surrounded
by
a
group
of
breathlessly
listening
children
and
joined
the
circle
to
hear
the
story
migwan
was
telling
she
had
apparently
just
finished
and
the
childish
voices
were
calling
out
from
all
sides
tell
it
again
nyoda
listened
with
interest
as
migwan
with
a
solemn
expression
and
impressive
voice
recited
the
tragic
tale
of
the
goop
who
would
wash
gunther
augustus
agricola
gunn
he
was
a
goop
if
there
ever
was
one
slapped
his
small
sister
he
could
reach

mouths
at
the

befell

agricola
g
for
gunther
augustus
unlike

i
hope
had
an
inborn
aversion
to
water
and
soap
he
fought
when
they
washed
him
he
squirmed
and
he
twisted
he
shrieked
scratched
and
wriggled
until
they
desisted
he
would
not
be
combed
it
was
no
use
to
try
o
he
was
a
goop
they
could
all
testify
so
gunther
went
dirty
unwashed
and
uncombed
with
hands
black
as
pitch
through
the
garden
he
roamed
when
suddenly
a
monstrous
black
shadow
fell
him
and
the
woman
who
scrubs
dirty
goops
stood
before
him
her
waist
was
a
washcloth
her
skirt
was
a
towel
she
looked
down
at
him
with
a
horrible
scowl
one
hand
was
a
brush
and
the
other
a
comb
her
forehead
was
soap
and
her
pompadour
foam
her
foot
was
a
shoebrush
and
on
it
did
grow
a
shiny
steel
nail
file
in
place
of
a
toe
gunther
augustus
agricola
gunn
he
had
a
fright
if
he
ever
had
one

she
seized
him

he
did
shriek
and
threw
him
headforemost
right
into
the
creek
rubbed
soap
in
his
eyes
dirty
goops
o

and
in
combing
the
snarls
pulled
out
handfuls
of
hair
scrubbed
the
skin
off
his
nose
brushed
his
teeth
till
they
bled

his
ears
rapped
his
knuckles
and
gleefully
said

there
be
a
difference
when

done
after
that
young
agricola
strove
hard
to
see

very
how

could
be

feet
at
the
door
tipped
his
hat
to
the
preacher

his
small
sister

could
reach
her
stood
still
while
they
washed
him
and
combed
out
his
hair
his
garments
he
folded
and
laid
on
a
chair
gunter
augustus
agricola
gunn
he
was
a
saint
if
there
ever
was
one
where
did
you
get
that
poem
asked
nyoda
i
wrote
it
myself
answered
migwan
good
work
said
nyoda
will
you
give
me
a
copy
nyoda
showed
the
poem
to
professor
green
and
professor
green
showed
it
to
a
friend
who
was
column
editor
of
one
of
the
big
dailies
and
one
fine
morning
the
poem
appeared
in
the
paper
with
migwan
full
name
and
address
at
the
bottom
elsie
gardiner
adams
the
gardiners
did
not
happen
to
take
that
particular
paper
and
migwan
knew
nothing
of
it
until
she
reached
school
and
was
congratulated
on
all
sides
professor
green
who
had
taken
a
great
interest
in
migwan
since
she
had
worked
up
his
hunting
notes
in
such
a
striking
style
and
regarded
her
as
his
special
protégé
was
anxious
to
have
the
whole
school
know
what
a
gifted
girl
she
was
he
had
a
conference
with
the
principal
and
as
a
result
migwan
was
asked
to
read
her
poem
at
the
rhetorical
exercises
in
the
auditorium
that
day
when
she
finished
the
applause
was
deafening
and
with
blushing
cheeks
and
downcast
eyes
she
ran
from
the
stage
there
were
distinguished
visitors
at
school
that
day
representatives
of
a
national
organization
who
had
come
to
address
the
scholars
and
they
came
up
to
migwan
after
she
had
read
her
poem
to
be
introduced
and
offer
congratulations
teachers
stopped
her
in
the
hall
to
tell
her
how
bright
she
was
and
the
other
pupils
regarded
her
with
great
respect
migwan
was
the
lion
of
the
hour
she
hurried
home
on
flying
feet
and
danced
into
the
house
waving
the
paper
oh
mother
she
called
as
soon
as
she
was
inside
the
door
guess
what
i
got
to
show
you
her
mother
was
not
in
the
kitchen
and
she
ran
through
the
house
looking
for
her
oh
mother
she
called
oh
moth
why
what
the
matter
she
asked
stopping
in
surprise
in
the
sitting
room
door
gardiner
lay
on
the
couch
and
beside
her
sat
the
family
doctor
betty
stood
by
looking
very
much
frightened
gardiner
looked
up
as
migwan
came
in
it
nothing
she
said
trying
to
speak
lightly
just
a
little
spell
mother
has
to
go
to
the
hospital
said
betty
in
a
scared
voice
just
a
little
operation
said
gardiner
hastily
as
migwan
looked
ready
to
drop
nothing
serious
very
migwan
hour
of
triumph
was
completely
forgotten
in
the
anxiety
of
the
next
few
days
her
mother
rallied
slowly
from
the
operation
and
it
looked
as
though
she
would
have
to
remain
in
the
hospital
a
long
time
it
was
impossible
to
meet
this
added
expense
from
their
little
income
and
migwan
setting
her
teeth
bravely
drew
the
remainder
of
her
college
money
from
the
bank
to
pay
the
hospital
and
surgeon
bills
then
she
set
to
work
with
redoubled
zeal
to
write
something
which
would
sell
so
far
everything
she
had
sent
out
had
come
back
promptly
for
a
long
time
certain
advertisements
in
the
magazines
had
been
holding
her
attention
they
read
something
like
this
write
moving
picture
plays
bring
to
each
we
teach
you
how
by
an
infallible
method
anybody
can
do
it
full
particulars
sent
for
a
postage
stamp
migwan
had
seen
quite
a
few
picture
plays
many
of
them
miserably
poor
and
felt
that
she
could
write
better
ones
than
some
or
at
least
just
as
good
she
wrote
to
the
address
given
in
one
of
the
advertisements
asking
for
full
particulars
back
came
a
letter
couched
in
the
most
glowing
terms
which
migwan
was
not
experienced
enough
to
recognize
as
a
multigraphed
copy
which
stated
that
the
writer
had
noticed
in
her
letter
of
inquiry
a
literary
ability
well
worth
cultivating
and
he
would
feel
himself
highly
honored
to
be
allowed
to
teach
her
to
write
moving
picture
plays
a
field
in
which
she
would
speedily
gain
fame
and
fortune
he
would
throw
open
the
gates
of
success
for
her
for
the
nominal
fee
of
thirty
dollars
with
five
dollars
extra
for
stationery
etc
his
regular
fee
was
dollars
but
it
was
not
often
that
he
came
across
so
much
ability
as
she
had
and
he
considered
the
pleasure
he
would
derive
from
the
correspondence
course
worth
five
dollars
to
him
would
she
not
send
the
first
payment
of
five
dollars
by
return
mail
so
that
his
enjoyment
might
begin
as
soon
as
possible
migwan
read
the
letter
through
with
a
beating
heart
until
she
came
to
the
price
when
her
heart
sank
into
her
shoes
to
pay
thirty
dollars
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
she
wrote
to
several
more
advertisements
and
received
much
the
same
answer
from
all
of
them
there
was
only
one
which
she
could
consider
at
all
this
one
offered
no
correspondence
course
but
advertised
a
book
giving
all
the
details
of
scenario
writing
history
of
the
picture
play
form
where
to
sell
your
plays
all
in
one
comprehensive
volume
the
price
of
the
book
was
three
dollars
migwan
hesitated
a
long
time
over
this
last
one
but
the
subtle
language
of
the
advertisement
drew
her
back
again
and
again
like
a
magnet
and
finally
overcame
her
doubts
it
will
pay
for
itself
many
times
when
i
have
learned
to
write
plays
she
reflected
so
she
took
three
precious
dollars
from
the
housekeeping
money
and
sent
for
the
book
she
did
not
ask
nyoda
advice
this
time
somehow
she
shrank
from
telling
her
about
it
in
three
days
the
book
arrived
the
comprehensive
volume
was
a
pamphlet
containing
exactly
pages
it
could
not
have
sold
for
more
than
ten
or
fifteen
cents
in
a
book
store
the
first
five
pages
were
devoted
to
a
description
of
the
phenomenal
sale
of
the
first
edition
of
the
book
two
more
enlarged
upon
the
unfillable
demand
of
the
motion
picture
companies
for
scenarios
while
the
remainder
of
the
book
was
given
over
to
the
technique
of
scenario
writing
migwan
read
it
through
eagerly
and
did
gain
an
idea
of
the
form
in
which
a
play
should
be
cast
although
the
information
was
meagre
enough
three
dollars
was
an
outrageous
price
to
pay
for
the
book
thought
migwan
but
she
comforted
herself
with
the
thought
that
by
means
of
it
she
would
soon
lift
the
family
out
of
their
difficulties
she
set
to
work
with
a
cheery
heart
writing
picture
plays
was
easier
than
writing
stories
on
account
of
the
skeleton
form
in
which
they
were
cast
which
made
it
unnecessary
to
strive
for
excellence
of
literary
style
she
finished
the
first
one
in
two
nights
and
sent
it
off
with
high
hopes
the
company
she
sent
it
to
was
listed
in
the
book
as
greatly
in
need
of
scenarios
and
taking
about
everything
sent
to
them
she
was
filled
with
a
secret
elation
and
went
about
the
house
singing
like
a
lark
until
betty
who
had
been
moping
like
an
owl
since
her
mother
went
to
the
hospital
was
quite
cheered
up
what
are
you
so
happy
about
she
asked
curiously
you
act
as
if
somebody
had
left
you
a
fortune
maybe
they
have
replied
migwan
mysteriously
wait
and
see
her
joy
was
however
for
the
play
came
back
even
more
promptly
than
the
stories
had
undaunted
she
sent
it
out
again
and
again
the
reasons
given
for
rejection
would
have
been
amusing
if
migwan
had
not
felt
so
disappointed
one
said
there
was
insufficient
plot
one
said
the
plot
was
too
complicated
one
said
it
was
too
long
for
a
and
the
next
said
it
was
too
short
even
for
a
two
places
kept
the
return
postage
she
had
enclosed
and
sent
the
manuscript
back
collect
scenario
writing
became
a
rather
expensive
amusement
instead
of
a
bringer
of
fortune
in
spite
of
all
this
she
kept
on
writing
scenarios
for
the
fascination
of
the
game
had
her
in
its
grip
and
she
would
never
be
satisfied
until
she
succeeded
lessons
were
thrust
into
the
background
of
her
mind
by
the
throng
of
leaders
inserts
synopses
that
flashed
through
her
head
continually
to
write
steadily
night
after
night
after
the
lessons
had
been
gotten
out
of
the
way
was
a
great
tax
on
her
young
strength
nyoda
was
inflexible
about
her
stopping
typewriting
at
nine
but
she
went
home
and
wrote
by
hand
until
midnight
nyoda
was
over
at
the
house
one
afternoon
when
migwan
was
settling
down
to
get
her
lessons
and
saw
her
take
a
dose
from
a
phial
what
are
you
taking
medicine
for
she
asked
oh
this
is
just
something
to
tone
me
up
replied
migwan
what
is
it
insisted
nyoda
it
strychnine
said
migwan
strychnine
said
nyoda
in
a
horrified
voice
who
taught
you
to
take
strychnine
as
a
stimulant
mabel
collins
did
answered
migwan
she
said
she
always
took
it
when
she
had
a
dance
on
for
every
night
in
the
week
and
could
keep
up
any
other
way
and
it
made
her
feel
fine
mabel
collins
belonged
to
what
the
class
called
the
fast
bunch
i
have
a
talk
with
mabel
collins
said
nyoda
with
a
resolute
gleam
in
her
eye
and
remember
no
more
of
this
for
you
i
knew
girls
in
college
who
took
strychnine
to
keep
themselves
going
through
examinations
or
other
occasions
of
great
physical
strain
and
they
have
suffered
for
it
ever
since
if
you
are
doing
so
much
that
you
up
any
other
way
than
by
taking
powerful
medicines
it
is
time
you
down
fresh
air
and
regular
sleep
are
all
the
tonic
you
need
you
stay
away
from
that
typewriter
for
a
whole
week
and
go
to
bed
at
nine
every
night
i
coming
down
to
tuck
you
in
now
remember
and
with
this
solemn
warning
nyoda
left
her
chapter
viii
sahwah
makes
a
basket
the
game
between
the
washington
high
school
and
the
carnegie
mechanics
institute
which
was
to
decide
the
girls
basketball
championship
of
the
city
was
scheduled
for
the
of
february
up
until
this
year
washington
high
had
never
come
within
sight
of
the
championship
then
this
season
something
had
happened
to
the
varsity
team
which
had
made
it
a
power
to
be
reckoned
with
among
the
schools
of
the
city
that
something
was
sahwah
thanks
to
her
playing
washington
high
had
not
lost
a
single
game
so
far
her
being
put
on
the
team
was
purely
due
to
chance
sahwah
was
a
junior
and
the
varsity
team
were
all
seniors
she
was
a
member
of
the
scrub
or
practice
team
and
an
ardent
devotee
of
the
sport
during
one
of
the
early
games
of
the
season
sahwah
was
sitting
on
the
side
lines
attentively
watching
every
bit
of
play
the
game
was
going
against
the
washington
due
to
the
fact
that
their
forwards
were
too
slow
to
break
through
the
guarding
of
the
rival
team
sahwah
saw
the
weakness
and
tingled
with
a
desire
to
get
into
the
game
and
do
some
speed
work
as
by
a
miracle
the
chance
was
given
her
one
of
the
forwards
strained
her
finger
slightly
and
was
taken
from
the
game
her
substitute
who
had
been
sitting
next
to
sahwah
had
left
her
seat
and
gone
to
the
other
end
of
the
gymnasium
the
instructor
who
was
acting
as
referee
in
her
excitement
mistook
sahwah
for
the
substitute
and
called
her
out
on
the
floor
sahwah
wondered
but
obeyed
instantly
and
went
into
the
game
as
forward
then
the
spectators
began
to
sit
up
and
take
notice
sahwah
had
not
been
two
minutes
on
the
floor
when
she
made
a
basket
right
between
the
arms
of
the
tall
guard
the
ripple
of
surprise
had
hardly
died
away
before
she
had
made
another
then
the
baskets
followed
thick
and
fast
in
five
minutes
of
play
she
had
tied
the
score
the
guards
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
when
they
saw
this
lithe
girl
slipping
like
an
eel
through
their
defense
and
caging
the
ball
with
a
sure
hand
every
time
the
game
ended
with
an
overwhelming
victory
for
the
washingtons
and
there
was
a
new
star
forward
on
the
horizon
sahwah
was
changed
from
the
practice
team
to
the
varsity
from
that
time
forward
washington
high
forged
steadily
ahead
in
the
race
for
the
championship
and
as
yet
had
no
defeat
on
its
record
however
washington
had
a
formidable
rival
in
the
carnegie
mechanics
institute
which
was
also
undefeated
so
far
the
mechanicals
were
slightly
older
girls
and
were
known
as
a
whirlwind
team
sahwah
who
foresaw
long
ago
that
the
supreme
struggle
would
be
between
the
washingtons
and
the
mechanicals
attended
the
games
played
by
the
mechanicals
whenever
she
could
and
studied
their
style
of
playing
star
players
every
one
was
her
deduction
but
weak
on
team
work
sahwah
was
not
so
dazzled
by
her
own
excellence
as
a
player
that
she
could
not
recognize
greatness
in
a
rival
and
she
readily
admitted
that
one
of
the
girls
who
guarded
for
the
mechanicals
was
the
best
guard
she
had
ever
seen
this
was
marie
lanning
whose
cousin
joe
was
in
sahwah
class
at
washington
high
sahwah
knew
instinctively
that
when
the
struggle
came
she
would
go
up
against
this
girl
the
game
would
really
be
between
these
two
washington
hope
lay
in
sahwah
ability
to
make
baskets
and
the
hope
of
the
mechanicals
was
marie
ability
to
keep
her
from
making
them
so
she
studied
marie
guarding
until
she
knew
the
places
where
she
could
break
through
marie
lanning
also
knew
that
it
was
sahwah
she
would
have
to
deal
with
but
there
was
a
difference
in
the
attitude
of
the
girls
toward
each
other
sahwah
regarded
marie
as
her
opponent
but
she
respected
her
prowess
she
had
no
personal
resentment
against
marie
for
being
a
good
guard
she
looked
upon
her
as
an
enemy
merely
because
she
belonged
to
a
rival
school
marie
on
the
other
hand
actually
hated
sahwah
before
sahwah
appeared
on
the
scene
she
had
been
the
greatest
player
in
the
athletic
association
the
heroine
of
every
game
she
was
pointed
out
everywhere
she
went
as
marie
lanning
the
basketball
player
now
some
of
her
glory
was
dimmed
for
another
star
had
risen
sarah
ann
brewster
the
whirlwind
forward
of
the
washington
high
team
was
threatening
to
overshadow
her
it
was
a
distinctly
personal
matter
with
her
sahwah
wanted
to
win
that
game
so
her
school
would
have
the
championship
marie
wanted
to
win
it
for
her
own
glory
she
did
not
really
believe
that
sahwah
was
as
great
as
she
was
made
out
it
was
only
because
she
had
never
run
against
a
great
guard
that
she
had
been
able
to
roll
up
the
score
for
washington
so
many
times
well
she
would
find
out
a
thing
or
two
when
she
played
the
mechanicals
marie
reflected
complacently
she
had
never
seen
sahwah
play
and
if
any
one
had
suggested
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
watch
her
tactics
she
would
have
been
very
scornful
she
was
confident
in
her
own
powers
then
there
came
a
rather
important
game
of
washington
high
on
a
night
when
marie
was
visiting
her
cousin
joe
he
had
tickets
for
the
game
and
took
her
along
now
for
the
first
time
she
beheld
her
foe
after
watching
sahwah
marvelous
shots
at
the
basket
and
the
confusion
of
the
girl
who
was
guarding
her
marie
began
to
feel
uneasy
it
now
seemed
to
her
that
sahwah
powers
had
been
underestimated
in
the
reports
instead
of
the
game
ended
just
as
all
the
others
had
done
with
a
great
score
for
washington
high
and
sahwah
the
idol
of
the
hour
marie
looked
on
with
a
slight
sneer
when
sahwah
after
the
game
was
over
frankly
congratulated
the
losing
team
on
their
playing
which
had
been
pretty
good
throughout
do
you
know
said
sahwah
straightforwardly
that
if
you
had
had
a
little
better
team
work
i
do
believe
we
could
have
beaten
you
any
day
we
could
have
won
with
you
in
the
game
said
one
of
the
losers
the
way
you
can
shoot
that
ball
into
the
basket
without
being
at
all
puffed
up
by
this
compliment
sahwah
proceeded
to
make
her
point
my
throwing
the
ball
into
the
basket
was
what
won
the
game
she
said
simply
it
was
the
fact
that
i
had
it
to
throw
it
all
due
to
the
girls
who
see
that
i
get
it
it
team
work
that
wins
every
time
and
not
individual
starring
thus
was
sahwah
in
the
habit
of
disclaiming
the
credit
of
victory
joe
brought
up
marie
lanning
and
introduced
her
so
this
is
my
deadly
enemy
said
sahwah
pleasantly
marie
acknowledged
the
introduction
politely
but
while
her
lips
smiled
her
eyes
had
a
steely
glitter
sahwah
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
admiring
friends
at
this
time
and
there
was
no
chance
for
further
conversation
and
she
did
not
become
aware
of
marie
animosity
we
meet
again
sahwah
said
meaningly
with
a
pleasant
laugh
as
marie
and
joe
turned
to
go
that
is
she
added
with
a
humorous
twinkle
if
i
do
go
down
in
my
studies
and
get
myself
debarred
from
playing
fine
chance
of
your
going
down
said
joe
oh
i
do
know
laughed
sahwah
it
all
depends
on
whether
i
get
my
physics
notebook
in
by
the
first
a
shout
of
laughter
greeted
this
remark
the
idea
of
sahwah
getting
herself
debarred
on
account
of
her
studies
was
too
funny
for
words
well
said
joe
to
marie
when
they
were
outside
the
building
the
girl
you
going
to
have
to
play
against
what
do
you
think
of
her
in
his
heart
joe
thought
that
his
cousin
marie
would
have
no
trouble
holding
sahwah
down
she
a
great
deal
faster
than
i
thought
said
marie
with
a
thoughtful
frown
but
you
can
beat
her
ca
you
asked
joe
anxiously
you
got
to
i
staked
my
whole
winter
allowance
that
you
would
win
the
championship
i
did
know
that
you
were
in
the
habit
of
betting
said
marie
a
little
disdainfully
i
never
did
before
said
joe
but
some
of
the
fellows
were
saying
that
nobody
could
hold
out
against
that
brewster
girl
and
i
said
i
bet
my
cousin
could
and
so
we
talked
back
and
forth
until
i
offered
to
bet
real
money
on
you
marie
was
flattered
at
this
as
her
kind
would
be
i
can
beat
her
she
said
but
there
was
fear
in
her
heart
oh
if
she
would
only
be
debarred
from
the
game
she
exclaimed
eagerly
but
sahwah
had
no
intentions
of
being
put
out
on
that
score
she
applied
herself
assiduously
to
the
making
of
the
notebook
that
was
required
as
the
resume
of
the
half
year
work
she
finished
it
a
whole
day
ahead
of
time
and
then
was
so
pleased
with
herself
that
she
decided
to
celebrate
the
event
come
over
to
the
house
she
said
to
various
of
her
girl
and
boy
friends
in
school
that
day
entertaining
in
honor
of
my
physics
notebook
when
the
guests
arrived
the
notebook
was
enthroned
on
a
gilded
easel
on
the
parlor
table
and
decorated
with
a
wreath
of
flowers
and
a
card
bearing
the
inscription
endlich
the
very
ridiculousness
of
the
whole
affair
was
enough
to
make
every
one
have
a
good
time
the
winnebagos
were
there
and
some
of
their
brothers
and
cousins
and
dick
albright
and
joe
lanning
and
several
more
boys
from
the
class
naturally
much
of
the
conversation
turned
on
the
coming
game
and
sahwah
was
solemnly
assured
that
she
would
forfeit
their
friendship
forever
if
she
did
not
win
the
championship
for
the
school
school
spirit
ran
high
and
songs
and
yells
were
practiced
until
the
neighbors
groaned
joe
lanning
joined
in
the
yells
with
as
much
vigor
as
any
no
one
knew
that
he
was
secretly
on
the
side
of
the
mechanicals
sahwah
notebook
came
in
for
inspection
and
much
admiration
for
she
was
good
at
physics
and
her
drawings
were
to
be
envied
i
see
you
have
a
list
of
all
the
problems
the
class
has
done
this
year
said
dick
albright
looking
through
the
notebook
do
you
mind
if
i
copy
them
from
your
list
i
lost
the
one
fizzy
gave
us
in
class
and
it
take
me
all
night
to
pick
them
out
from
the
ones
in
the
book
certainly
you
may
said
sahwah
cordially
take
it
along
with
you
and
bring
it
to
school
in
the
morning
it
be
all
right
as
long
as
i
get
it
in
by
that
time
but
do
forget
it
whatever
you
do
unless
you
want
to
see
me
put
out
of
the
game
joe
lanning
wished
fervently
that
dick
would
forget
to
bring
it
the
party
broke
up
and
the
boys
and
girls
prepared
to
depart
what
car
do
you
take
dick
asked
one
of
the
boys
i
do
think
i
take
any
said
dick
i
just
run
around
the
corner
with
this
lady
he
said
indicating
migwan
and
then
i
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
is
it
pretty
far
asked
some
one
else
not
the
way
i
go
answered
dick
i
take
the
short
cut
through
the
railway
tunnel
joe
lanning
eyes
gleamed
suddenly
the
were
all
said
and
sahwah
shut
the
door
and
set
the
furniture
straight
before
she
went
to
bed
did
your
friends
stay
rather
late
asked
her
mother
from
upstairs
no
said
sahwah
i
do
think
so
it
only
why
the
clock
has
stopped
she
finished
after
a
look
at
the
mantel
i
do
know
what
time
it
is
get
the
time
from
the
telephone
operator
said
her
mother
and
set
the
clock
sahwah
picked
up
the
receiver
there
was
a
strange
buzzing
noise
on
the
wire
puzzled
at
first
she
soon
recognized
what
it
was
it
was
the
sound
of
joe
lanning
wireless
joe
lived
directly
back
of
sahwah
on
the
next
street
and
the
aerial
of
his
wireless
apparatus
was
fastened
to
the
telephone
pole
in
the
brewsters
yard
joe
was
sending
and
the
vibrations
were
being
picked
up
by
the
telephone
wires
and
carried
to
her
ear
when
she
had
the
receiver
down
sahwah
understood
the
wireless
code
the
boys
used
and
in
fact
had
both
sent
and
received
messages
she
knew
it
was
joe
custom
to
listen
for
the
time
every
night
as
it
was
flashed
out
from
the
station
at
arlington
and
then
send
it
to
his
friend
abraham
goldstein
a
young
jewish
lad
in
the
class
who
also
had
a
wireless
then
the
two
would
send
each
other
messages
and
verify
them
the
next
day
oh
what
fun
thought
sahwah
i
can
get
arlington
time
she
asked
the
operator
to
look
up
a
new
number
for
her
to
keep
her
off
the
line
and
then
got
out
paper
and
pencil
to
take
down
the
message
as
it
went
out
as
she
deciphered
it
she
gasped
in
astonishment
she
had
expected
a
message
something
on
this
order
hello
abraham
how
are
you
arlington
says
ten
bells
how
the
weather
in
your
neck
of
the
woods
instead
the
words
were
entirely
different
she
could
not
believe
her
eyes
as
she
made
them
out
albright
going
through
railway
tunnel
hold
him
up
get
notebook
away
keep
brewster
out
of
game
her
senses
reeled
as
she
understood
the
meaning
of
the
message
that
joe
was
plotting
against
her
when
he
pretended
to
be
a
friend
cut
her
to
the
quick
for
a
moment
her
lip
quivered
then
her
nature
asserted
itself
there
was
a
thing
to
do
and
she
must
do
it
dick
must
be
kept
from
going
through
the
tunnel
turning
out
the
lights
downstairs
she
crept
noiselessly
out
of
the
house
found
her
brother
bicycle
on
the
porch
and
pedaled
off
after
dick
she
knew
exactly
the
way
he
would
take
from
migwan
house
he
would
go
up
adams
to
locust
street
and
from
there
to
th
avenue
and
keep
on
going
until
he
came
to
the
dark
tunnel
sahwah
nearly
burst
with
indignation
when
she
thought
of
joe
cowardly
conduct
he
was
calmly
getting
abraham
to
do
the
dirty
work
for
him
so
he
would
never
be
suspected
of
having
anything
to
do
with
it
in
case
dick
recognized
abraham
she
could
see
how
the
thing
would
work
out
abraham
lived
just
the
other
side
of
the
tunnel
all
he
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
stand
in
the
shadow
of
the
tunnel
jump
out
on
dick
as
he
came
through
seize
the
notebook
from
his
hand
and
run
away
before
dick
knew
what
had
happened
there
would
be
no
need
of
fighting
or
hurting
him
but
joe
end
would
be
accomplished
and
washington
would
lose
the
game
the
fact
that
he
was
a
traitor
to
the
school
hurt
sahwah
ten
times
worse
than
the
injury
he
was
trying
to
do
her
even
if
his
cousin
on
the
other
side
he
belongs
to
washington
she
repeated
over
and
over
to
herself
down
locust
street
she
flew
and
along
deserted
th
avenue
it
was
bitterly
cold
riding
but
she
took
no
notice
far
ahead
of
her
she
could
see
dick
walking
briskly
toward
the
fatal
tunnel
pedaling
for
dear
life
she
caught
up
with
him
when
he
was
still
some
distance
from
it
whatever
is
the
matter
he
asked
startled
as
she
flung
herself
breathless
from
the
wheel
beside
him
the
notebook
she
said
joe
trying
to
get
it
away
from
you
got
abraham
goldstein
waiting
in
the
tunnel
to
snatch
it
as
you
go
by
dick
gave
vent
to
a
long
whistle
of
astonishment
of
all
the
underhand
tricks
he
exclaimed
when
the
full
significance
of
joe
act
was
borne
in
on
him
he
was
stupefied
to
think
that
joe
was
a
traitor
to
the
school
that
fix
his
chances
of
getting
into
the
he
said
vehemently
his
name
is
coming
up
next
week
to
be
voted
on
just
wait
until
i
tell
what
i
know
about
him
dick
retraced
his
steps
and
took
sahwah
home
where
he
left
the
precious
notebook
in
her
keeping
to
prevent
any
possibility
of
its
getting
lost
before
she
could
hand
it
in
and
then
took
the
streetcar
and
rode
home
the
roundabout
way
arriving
there
in
safety
abraham
waited
out
in
the
cold
tunnel
for
several
hours
and
then
gave
it
up
and
went
home
feeling
decidedly
out
of
temper
with
joe
lanning
and
his
intrigues
the
game
was
held
in
the
washington
high
gymnasium
the
gallery
and
all
available
floor
space
were
packed
long
before
the
commencement
of
the
game
the
carnegie
mechanics
came
out
in
a
body
to
witness
their
team
win
the
championship
joe
lanning
was
there
entirely
composed
though
inwardly
raging
at
the
failure
of
his
trick
which
he
attributed
to
dick
changing
his
mind
about
walking
home
never
dreaming
that
sahwah
had
intercepted
his
message
and
his
treachery
was
known
although
his
sympathies
were
with
the
mechanicals
he
stood
with
the
washingtons
and
yelled
their
yells
as
loudly
as
any
the
mechanicals
as
the
visiting
team
came
out
on
the
floor
first
and
had
the
first
practice
they
were
fine
looking
girls
every
one
of
them
with
their
dazzling
white
middies
and
blue
ties
they
were
greeted
with
a
ringing
cheer
from
their
rooters
marie
lanning
held
up
her
head
and
looked
when
she
heard
the
familiar
yell
thundered
at
the
team
it
was
meant
mostly
for
herself
she
was
sure
she
smiled
proudly
and
graciously
in
the
direction
whence
the
yell
had
proceeded
quiet
had
hardly
fallen
on
the
crowd
when
there
was
heard
the
sound
of
singing
from
the
upper
end
of
the
gymnasium
where
the
door
to
the
dressing
rooms
was
the
tune
was
old
black
joe
we
coming
we
coming
star
players
every
one
we
going
to
win
the
championship
for
washington
washington
rooters
caught
up
the
yell
and
made
the
roof
ring
heart
swelled
when
she
heard
it
not
with
the
feeling
that
they
were
singing
to
her
but
with
pride
because
she
belonged
to
a
team
which
called
out
this
expression
of
loyalty
then
came
individual
cheers
with
her
name
at
the
head
of
the
list
one
two
four
who
are
for
brewster
not
even
then
was
sahwah
puffed
up
the
washington
high
team
wore
black
bloomers
and
red
ties
they
were
a
brilliant
sight
as
they
marched
in
with
their
hands
on
each
shoulders
the
teams
took
their
places
a
hush
fell
on
the
crowd
the
referee
whistle
sounded
the
ball
went
up
washington
center
knocked
it
toward
her
basket
sahwah
darting
out
from
under
the
basket
caught
it
sent
it
flying
back
to
center
center
threw
it
to
the
other
washington
forward
sahwah
jumped
directly
behind
marie
lanning
received
the
ball
from
the
other
forward
and
shot
the
basket
time
one
minute
from
the
sending
up
of
the
ball
the
washington
team
machine
was
working
splendidly
a
deafening
roar
greeted
the
first
score
marie
bit
her
lip
angrily
she
had
vowed
to
keep
washington
from
scoring
but
sahwah
had
not
watched
marie
play
for
nothing
she
saw
that
she
put
up
a
wonderful
guard
when
confronting
her
girl
but
she
was
not
always
quick
in
turning
around
sahwah
plan
of
action
was
to
keep
away
from
her
as
much
as
possible
and
to
get
hold
of
the
ball
when
she
was
behind
back
and
throw
for
the
basket
before
marie
could
turn
around
guarding
is
only
effective
when
you
have
some
one
to
guard
and
marie
discovered
she
was
really
playing
a
game
of
tag
with
sahwah
who
was
continually
running
away
from
her
with
the
wonderful
team
work
which
the
washington
team
had
developed
and
their
perfect
understanding
of
each
movements
sahwah
could
get
widely
separated
from
marie
and
be
sure
to
receive
the
ball
at
just
the
right
moment
to
throw
a
basket
twice
she
made
it
three
times
four
times
pandemonium
reigned
guard
her
marie
shrieked
the
mechanicals
the
score
stood
to
in
favor
of
washington
at
the
end
of
the
first
five
minutes
marie
was
white
with
rage
was
this
a
girl
she
was
trying
to
guard
or
was
it
an
eel
she
would
get
her
cornered
with
the
ball
sahwah
would
measure
marie
height
with
her
eye
locate
the
basket
with
a
brief
glance
stiffen
her
muscles
for
a
jump
and
then
as
marie
stood
ready
to
beat
down
the
ball
as
it
rose
in
the
air
sahwah
would
suddenly
relax
twist
into
some
inconceivable
position
shoot
the
ball
low
to
center
and
be
a
dozen
feet
away
before
marie
could
get
her
hands
down
from
the
air
s
brewster
sang
the
washington
rooters
in
ecstasy
it
was
maddening
there
was
no
hope
of
keeping
her
from
scoring
the
time
came
when
sahwah
and
marie
both
had
their
hands
on
the
ball
at
the
same
time
and
it
called
for
a
as
the
ball
rose
in
the
air
marie
struck
out
as
if
to
send
it
flying
to
center
but
instead
of
that
her
hand
clenched
with
a
heavy
ring
on
one
finger
struck
sahwah
full
on
the
nose
it
was
purely
accidental
as
every
one
could
see
sahwah
staggered
back
dizzily
seeing
stars
her
nose
began
to
bleed
furiously
she
was
taken
from
the
game
and
her
substitute
put
in
a
groan
went
up
from
the
washington
students
as
she
was
led
out
followed
by
a
suppressed
cheer
from
the
carnegie
mechanics
marie
met
joe
eye
with
a
triumphant
gleam
in
her
own
sahwah
was
beside
herself
at
the
thing
which
had
happened
to
her
the
game
and
the
championship
were
lost
to
washington
the
hope
of
the
team
was
gone
the
girl
who
took
her
place
was
far
inferior
both
in
skill
in
throwing
the
ball
and
in
tactics
she
could
not
make
a
single
basket
the
score
rolled
up
on
the
mechanicals
side
now
it
was
tied
sahwah
trying
to
stanch
the
blood
that
flowed
in
a
steady
stream
heard
the
roar
that
followed
the
tying
of
the
score
and
ground
her
teeth
in
misery
the
mechanicals
were
scoring
steadily
now
the
first
half
ended
to
in
their
favor
but
if
marie
had
expected
to
be
the
heroine
of
the
game
now
that
sahwah
was
out
of
it
she
was
disappointed
the
girl
who
had
taken
sahwah
place
required
no
skilful
guarding
she
would
not
have
made
any
baskets
anyhow
and
there
was
no
chance
for
a
brilliant
display
of
marie
powers
marie
stood
still
on
the
floor
after
the
first
half
ended
listening
to
the
cheers
and
expecting
her
name
to
be
shouted
above
the
rest
but
nothing
like
that
happened
the
yells
were
for
the
team
in
general
while
the
washingtons
loyal
to
sahwah
to
the
last
cheered
her
to
the
echo
the
noise
penetrated
to
the
dressing
room
where
she
lay
on
a
mat
ach
du
lieber
lieber
ach

lieber
lieber
brewster
no
ja
bum

ach

lieber

sahwah
raised
her
head
another
cheer
rent
the
air
s
brewster
sahwah
sat
up
brewster
brewster
we
want
brewster
thundered
the
gallery
sahwah
sprang
to
her
feet
like
a
knight
of
old
who
expiring
on
the
battlefield
heard
the
voice
of
his
lady
love
and
recovered
miraculously
sahwah
regained
her
strength
with
a
rush
when
she
heard
the
voice
of
her
beloved
school
calling
her
when
the
teams
came
out
for
the
second
half
sahwah
came
out
with
them
the
gallery
rocked
with
the
joy
of
the
washingtonians
the
whistle
sounded
the
ball
went
up
the
machine
was
in
working
order
again
washington
was
jubilant
carnegie
mechanics
was
equally
confident
now
that
it
was
in
the
lead
sahwah
played
like
a
whirlwind
she
shot
the
ball
into
the
basket
right
through
marie
hands
once
twice
the
score
was
again
tied
to
shouted
the
scorekeeper
through
her
megaphone
like
the
roar
of
the
waves
of
the
sea
rose
the
yell
of
the
washingtonians
who
tied
the
score
when
the
score
was
rolling
who
tied
the
score
when
the
score
was
rolling
brewster
yes
well
i
guess
tied
the
score
when
the
score
was
rolling
then
sahwah
luck
turned
and
she
could
make
no
more
baskets
she
began
to
feel
weak
again
and
fumbled
the
ball
more
than
once
marie
laughed
sneeringly
when
sahwah
failed
to
score
on
a
foul
the
game
was
drawing
to
a
close
two
more
minutes
to
play
called
the
referee
the
ball
was
under
the
mechanicals
basket
the
washington
guards
got
possession
of
it
and
passed
it
forward
to
sahwah
who
threw
for
the
basket
and
missed
the
ball
came
down
right
in
the
hands
of
marie
the
mechanicals
were
excellently
placed
to
pass
it
by
several
stages
down
to
their
basket
instead
of
throwing
it
to
center
however
she
tried
to
make
a
grandstand
play
and
threw
it
the
entire
length
of
the
gymnasium
to
the
waiting
forward
it
fell
short
and
there
was
a
wild
scramble
to
secure
it
washington
got
it
one
minute
to
play
called
the
referee
a
score
must
be
made
now
by
one
side
or
the
other
or
the
game
would
end
in
a
tie
the
washington
guard
located
sahwah
the
mechanicals
closed
in
around
her
so
that
she
could
not
get
away
by
herself
marie
towered
over
her
triumphantly
at
last
had
come
the
chance
to
use
her
famous
method
of
guarding
the
crowd
in
the
gallery
leaned
forward
tense
and
silent
the
mechanicals
forwards
ran
back
under
their
basket
to
be
in
position
to
throw
the
ball
in
when
marie
should
send
it
down
to
them
the
washington
guard
threw
the
ball
toward
the
massed
group
in
the
center
of
the
floor
as
a
tiger
leaps
to
its
prey
sahwah
with
a
mighty
spring
jumped
high
in
the
air
and
caught
the
ball
over
the
heads
of
the
blocking
guards
before
the
mechanicals
had
recovered
from
their
surprise
she
sent
it
whirling
toward
the
distant
basket
it
rolled
around
the
rim
hesitated
for
one
breathless
instant
and
then
dropped
neatly
through
the
netting
it
was
a
record
throw
from
the
field
time
up
called
the
referee
score
to
in
favor
of
washington
high
shouted
the
scorekeeper
the
emotions
of
the
washington
rooters
found
vent
in
a
prolonged
cheer
then
the
crowd
surged
across
the
floor
and
surrounded
sahwah
and
she
was
borne
in
triumph
from
the
gymnasium
joe
lanning
and
his
cousin
marie
avoiding
the
merry
throng
left
the
building
with
long
faces
and
never
a
word
to
say
chapter
ix
the
thessalonian
play
it
was
the
custom
each
year
for
the
thessalonians
the
boys
literary
society
of
washington
high
school
to
give
a
play
in
the
school
auditorium
this
year
the
play
was
to
be
a
translation
of
drama
marie
latour
after
a
careful
consideration
of
the
talents
of
their
various
girl
friends
gladys
was
asked
to
play
the
leading
role
and
sahwah
was
also
given
a
part
in
the
cast
it
was
the
play
where
the
unfortunate
marie
latour
pursued
by
enemies
hides
her
child
in
a
hollow
statue
of
joan
of
arc
in
order
to
produce
the
piece
a
large
statue
of
the
maid
of
orleans
was
made
to
order
it
was
constructed
of
some
inexpensive
composition
and
painted
to
look
like
bronze
in
the
one
scene
a
halo
appears
around
the
head
of
the
maid
while
she
is
sheltering
the
child
this
effect
was
produced
by
a
circle
of
tiny
lights
worked
by
a
storage
battery
inside
the
statue
for
the
sake
of
convenience
in
installing
the
electric
apparatus
and
the
wiring
one
half
of
the
skirt
it
was
the
statue
representing
joan
in
clothes
not
the
one
in
armor
was
made
in
the
form
of
a
door
which
opened
on
hinges
the
base
of
the
statue
was
of
wood
it
was
not
finished
until
the
day
before
the
play
and
was
used
for
the
first
time
at
the
dress
rehearsal
when
it
was
left
standing
on
the
stage
joe
lanning
was
in
rather
a
dark
mood
these
days
in
the
first
place
he
had
lost
his
winter
allowance
of
pocket
money
by
staking
it
on
the
mechanics
game
after
this
he
was
treated
coolly
by
a
large
number
of
his
classmates
and
not
knowing
that
the
story
of
his
treachery
was
being
privately
circulated
around
the
school
he
could
not
guess
the
reason
the
keenest
desire
of
his
life
was
to
be
made
a
member
of
the
thessalonian
literary
society
and
if
he
had
kept
his
record
unsmirched
he
would
have
been
taken
in
at
the
february
election
he
confidently
expected
to
be
elected
and
was
already
planning
in
his
mind
the
things
he
would
do
and
say
at
the
meetings
and
what
girls
he
would
take
to
the
thessalonian
dances
he
received
a
rude
shock
when
the
election
came
and
went
and
he
was
not
taken
in
he
knew
from
reliable
sources
that
his
name
was
coming
up
to
be
voted
on
and
it
was
not
very
flattering
to
realize
that
he
had
been
blackballed
from
an
eager
interest
in
all
thessalonian
doings
his
feeling
changed
to
bitter
resentment
against
the
society
just
now
the
thessalonian
play
was
the
topic
of
the
hour
and
the
very
mention
of
it
almost
made
him
ill
if
he
had
been
elected
he
would
have
been
an
usher
at
the
play
with
the
other
new
members
and
worn
the
club
colors
in
his
buttonhole
to
be
admired
by
the
girls
and
envied
by
the
other
fellows
but
now
there
was
none
of
that
charmed
fellowship
for
him
he
nourished
his
feeling
of
bitterness
and
hatred
until
his
scheming
mind
began
to
grope
for
some
way
of
spoiling
the
success
of
the
play
as
usual
he
turned
to
his
friend
abraham
goldstein
who
was
about
the
only
one
who
had
not
shown
any
coolness
together
they
watched
their
chance
the
play
progressed
toward
perfection
the
dress
rehearsal
had
been
held
the
day
of
the
first
night
had
arrived
the
stage
was
set
and
the
statue
of
the
maid
of
orleans
was
in
place
joe
poking
around
the
back
of
the
stage
saw
the
statue
and
received
his
evil
inspiration
just
about
the
time
the
play
was
given
there
was
being
held
in
the
school
an
exhibition
of
paintings
a
famous
and
very
valuable
collection
had
been
loaned
by
a
friend
of
the
school
for
the
benefit
of
the
students
of
drawing
the
paintings
were
on
display
in
one
of
the
girls
club
rooms
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
building
hinpoha
took
great
pleasure
in
examining
them
and
spent
a
long
time
over
them
every
day
after
school
was
closed
on
the
day
of
the
play
she
went
up
as
usual
to
the
club
room
for
an
hour
before
going
home
reluctantly
she
tore
herself
away
when
she
realized
that
the
afternoon
was
passing
as
she
returned
to
the
cloakroom
where
her
wraps
were
she
was
surprised
to
find
emily
meeks
there
emily
started
guiltily
when
hinpoha
entered
and
made
a
desperate
effort
to
finish
wrapping
up
something
she
had
in
her
hand
but
her
nervousness
got
into
her
fingers
and
made
them
tremble
so
that
the
object
she
held
fell
to
the
floor
as
it
fell
the
wrapper
came
open
and
hinpoha
could
see
what
it
was
it
was
one
of
the
water
colors
of
the
exhibition
collection
one
of
the
smallest
and
most
exquisite
ones
hinpoha
gasped
with
astonishment
when
she
caught
emily
in
the
act
of
stealing
it
emily
meeks
was
the
last
person
in
the
world
hinpoha
would
ever
have
accused
of
stealing
anything
emily
turned
white
and
red
by
turns
and
leaned
against
the
wall
trembling
yes
i
stole
it
she
said
in
a
kind
of
desperation
something
in
her
voice
took
the
scorn
out
of
hinpoha
face
she
looked
at
her
curiously
why
did
you
try
to
steal
emily
she
asked
gently
emily
burst
into
tears
and
sank
to
her
knees
you
would
understand
she
sobbed
maybe
i
would
said
hinpoha
softly
try
it
and
see
haltingly
emily
told
her
tale
in
a
moment
folly
she
had
promised
to
buy
a
set
of
books
from
an
agent
and
had
signed
a
paper
pledging
herself
to
pay
for
it
within
three
months
the
price
was
five
dollars
at
the
time
she
thought
she
could
save
enough
out
of
her
meager
wages
to
pay
it
but
found
that
she
could
not
the
time
was
up
several
months
ago
and
the
agent
was
threatening
her
with
a
lawsuit
if
she
did
not
pay
up
this
month
fearing
that
the
people
with
whom
she
lived
would
be
angry
if
they
heard
of
the
affair
and
would
turn
her
out
of
her
home
into
the
streets
for
to
her
a
lawsuit
was
something
vague
and
terrible
and
she
thought
she
would
have
to
go
to
jail
when
it
was
found
she
could
not
pay
she
grew
desperate
and
being
alone
in
the
room
with
the
paintings
for
an
instant
she
had
seized
the
opportunity
and
carried
one
out
under
her
middy
blouse
she
intended
to
sell
it
and
pay
for
the
books
hinpoha
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
emily
distress
she
was
very
tender
hearted
and
was
easily
touched
by
other
people
troubles
if
i
lent
you
five
dollars
to
pay
for
the
books
would
you
take
it
she
asked
emily
started
up
like
a
condemned
prisoner
who
is
pardoned
on
the
way
to
execution
i
pay
it
back
she
cried
if
i
have
to
go
out
scrubbing
to
earn
the
money
and
you
wo
say
anything
about
the
picture
she
said
clasping
her
hands
beseechingly
if
i
put
it
back
where
i
got
it
no
said
hinpoha
with
all
the
conviction
of
her
loyal
young
nature
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
i
will
never
say
anything
about
it
oh
you
an
angel
straight
from
heaven
exclaimed
emily
first
time
i
heard
of
a
angel
laughed
hinpoha
emily
stooped
to
pick
up
the
painting
and
restore
it
to
its
place
when
she
caught
her
breath
in
dismay
she
had
dropped
a
tear
on
the
picture
and
made
a
light
spot
on
the
dark
brown
trunk
of
a
tree
it
was
conspicuously
noticeable
and
would
be
sure
to
call
forth
the
strictest
inquiry
emily
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
it
my
punishment
she
groaned
for
trying
to
steal
now
i
ruined
the
honor
of
the
school
we
promised
to
send
those
pictures
back
unharmed
if
white
would
let
us
have
them
her
dismay
was
intense
hinpoha
examined
the
spot
carefully
do
you
know
she
said
i
believe
i
could
fill
in
that
place
with
dark
color
so
it
would
never
be
noticed
the
bark
of
the
tree
has
a
rough
appearance
and
the
slight
unevenness
around
the
edges
of
the
spot
will
never
be
noticed
do
worry
all
will
yet
be
well
if
hinpoha
would
have
let
her
emily
would
have
gone
down
on
her
knees
to
her
come
we
must
make
haste
said
hinpoha
you
go
right
home
and
i
will
take
the
picture
into
our
club
room
and
fix
it
up
and
then
slip
upstairs
with
it
and
nobody
will
ever
be
any
the
wiser
it
a
good
thing
there
nobody
up
there
now
emily
took
her
departure
vowing
undying
gratitude
to
hinpoha
and
hinpoha
took
her
paints
from
her
desk
and
went
into
her
own
club
room
which
was
on
the
third
floor
and
with
infinite
pains
matched
the
shade
of
the
tree
trunk
and
repaired
the
damage
her
efforts
were
crowned
with
better
success
even
than
she
had
hoped
for
and
with
thankfulness
in
her
heart
at
the
talent
which
could
thus
be
turned
to
account
to
help
a
friend
out
of
trouble
she
surveyed
the
little
painting
looking
just
as
it
did
when
loaned
to
the
school
she
carried
it
carefully
upstairs
but
at
the
door
of
the
exhibition
room
she
paused
in
dismay
a
whole
group
of
teachers
and
their
friends
were
looking
at
the
paintings
and
it
was
impossible
to
put
the
one
back
without
being
noticed
irresolutely
she
turned
away
and
retraced
her
steps
to
the
third
floor
intending
to
wait
in
her
club
room
until
the
coast
was
clear
but
alas
in
coming
out
hinpoha
had
left
the
door
open
the
club
rooms
were
generally
kept
locked
while
she
was
going
upstairs
a
number
of
students
coming
out
from
late
practice
in
the
gymnasium
spied
the
open
door
and
went
in
to
look
around
it
was
impossible
for
hinpoha
to
go
in
there
with
that
picture
in
her
hand
the
only
thing
to
do
if
she
did
not
wish
to
get
into
trouble
was
to
get
rid
of
it
immediately
delay
was
getting
dangerous
she
was
standing
near
the
back
entrance
of
the
stage
when
she
was
looking
for
a
place
to
hide
the
picture
beside
the
stage
entrance
there
was
a
little
room
containing
all
the
lighting
switches
for
the
stage
various
battery
boxes
and
other
electrical
equipment
together
with
a
motley
collection
of
stage
properties
quick
as
a
flash
hinpoha
opened
the
door
of
this
room
darted
in
and
hid
the
picture
in
a
roll
of
cheesecloth
when
she
came
out
one
of
the
teachers
was
standing
directly
before
the
door
pointing
out
to
a
friend
the
construction
of
the
stage
have
we
a
new
electrician
he
inquired
genially
as
he
saw
her
coming
out
of
the
electric
room
hinpoha
laughed
at
his
pleasantry
but
she
was
flushed
and
uncomfortable
from
the
excitement
of
the
last
moment
hinpoha
was
a
poor
dissembler
she
went
upstairs
until
the
art
room
was
empty
of
visitors
and
then
returned
swiftly
to
the
electric
room
for
the
picture
she
slipped
it
under
her
middy
blouse
where
it
was
safe
from
detection
and
sped
upstairs
with
it
as
she
crossed
the
hall
to
the
stairs
she
met
the
same
teacher
the
second
time
well
you
must
be
an
electrician
he
said
that
twice
you
rushed
out
of
there
in
such
a
businesslike
manner
hinpoha
laughed
but
flushed
painfully
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
eyes
could
look
right
through
her
middy
and
see
the
picture
underneath
this
time
the
coast
was
clear
in
the
room
where
the
pictures
were
and
she
deposited
the
adventurous
water
color
safely
she
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
relief
when
she
realized
that
the
danger
was
over
and
she
had
nothing
more
to
conceal
she
trudged
home
through
the
snow
with
a
warm
feeling
that
she
had
been
the
means
of
saving
a
friend
from
disgrace
sahwah
who
was
in
the
play
and
had
a
right
to
go
up
on
the
stage
which
was
all
ready
set
for
the
first
scene
ran
in
to
see
how
things
looked
late
in
the
afternoon
the
school
was
practically
empty
all
the
rest
of
the
cast
had
gone
home
to
get
some
sleep
to
fit
them
for
the
ordeal
of
the
coming
performance
and
the
teachers
who
had
been
looking
at
the
paintings
had
also
left
the
rest
of
the
building
was
in
darkness
as
twilight
had
already
fallen
one
set
of
lights
was
burning
on
the
stage
sahwah
had
no
special
business
on
the
stage
she
was
simply
curious
to
see
what
it
looked
like
sahwah
never
stopped
to
analyze
her
motives
for
doing
things
she
paused
to
admire
the
statue
of
joan
of
arc
standing
in
all
the
majesty
of
its
height
this
was
the
first
chance
she
had
had
to
examine
it
leisurely
in
the
rehearsal
the
night
before
she
had
merely
seen
it
in
a
general
way
as
she
whisked
off
and
on
the
stage
in
her
part
the
construction
of
the
thing
fascinated
her
and
she
opened
the
door
in
the
skirt
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
about
the
inner
workings
of
the
miraculous
halo
she
saw
how
the
thing
was
done
and
then
became
interested
in
the
inside
of
the
statue
itself
there
was
plenty
of
room
in
it
to
conceal
a
person
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
sahwah
got
inside
and
drew
the
door
shut
after
her
trying
to
imagine
herself
a
fugitive
hiding
in
there
there
were
no
openings
in
the
skirt
part
but
up
above
the
waist
line
there
were
various
holes
to
admit
air
it
no
fun
hiding
in
a
statue
if
you
ca
see
what
going
on
outside
thought
sahwah
and
so
she
stood
up
straight
as
in
this
position
her
eyes
would
come
on
a
level
with
one
of
the
holes
she
could
see
out
without
being
seen
herself
just
as
if
she
were
looking
through
the
face
piece
of
a
suit
of
armor
the
fun
she
got
out
of
this
sport
however
soon
changed
to
dismay
when
she
tried
to
get
down
again
it
had
taken
some
squeezing
to
get
her
head
into
the
upper
space
and
now
she
found
that
she
was
wedged
securely
in
she
could
not
move
her
head
one
particle
what
was
worse
a
quantity
of
cotton
wool
which
had
been
put
inside
the
upper
part
of
the
body
for
some
reason
or
other
was
dislodged
by
her
squeezing
in
and
pressed
against
her
mouth
forming
an
effective
silencer
thus
while
she
could
see
out
over
the
stage
she
could
not
call
out
for
help
her
hands
were
pinioned
down
at
her
sides
and
by
standing
up
she
had
brought
her
knees
into
a
narrow
place
so
that
they
were
wedged
together
and
she
could
not
attract
attention
by
kicking
here
was
a
pretty
state
of
affairs
the
benign
maid
of
orleans
had
sahwah
in
as
merciless
a
grip
as
that
with
which
the
famous
iron
maiden
of
medieval
times
crushed
out
the
lives
of
its
victims
sahwah
knew
that
her
failure
to
come
from
school
would
call
out
a
search
but
who
would
ever
look
for
her
in
the
statue
on
the
stage
her
only
hope
was
to
wait
until
the
play
was
in
progress
and
the
door
was
opened
to
conceal
the
child
then
another
thought
startled
her
into
a
perspiration
she
was
in
the
opening
scene
of
the
play
if
she
was
not
there
the
play
could
not
commence
they
would
spend
the
evening
searching
for
her
and
the
statue
would
not
be
opened
what
would
they
do
about
the
play
the
house
was
sold
out
and
the
people
would
come
to
see
the
performance
and
there
would
be
none
all
on
account
of
her
stupidity
in
wedging
herself
inside
of
the
statue
sahwah
called
herself
severe
names
as
she
languished
in
her
prison
fortunately
there
were
enough
holes
in
the
thing
to
supply
plenty
of
ventilation
otherwise
it
might
have
gone
hard
with
her
the
cramped
position
became
exceedingly
tiresome
she
tried
by
forcing
her
weight
against
the
one
side
or
the
other
to
throw
the
statue
over
thinking
that
it
would
attract
attention
in
this
way
and
some
one
would
be
likely
to
open
it
but
the
heavy
wooden
base
to
which
it
was
fastened
held
it
secure
sahwah
was
caught
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
the
minutes
passed
like
hours
sounds
died
away
in
the
building
as
the
last
of
the
lingerers
on
the
downstairs
floor
took
themselves
off
through
the
front
entrance
she
could
hear
the
slam
of
the
heavy
door
and
then
a
shout
as
one
boy
hailed
another
in
greeting
then
silence
over
everything
a
quarter
or
maybe
a
half
hour
dragged
by
on
leaden
feet
suddenly
without
noise
or
warning
two
figures
appeared
on
the
stage
coming
on
through
the
back
entrance
sahwah
heart
beat
joyfully
here
was
some
one
to
look
over
the
scenery
again
and
if
she
could
only
attract
their
attention
they
would
liberate
her
she
made
a
desperate
effort
and
wrenched
her
mouth
open
to
call
only
to
get
it
full
of
fuzzy
cotton
wool
that
nearly
choked
her
there
was
no
hope
then
but
that
they
would
open
the
door
of
the
statue
and
find
her
accidentally
she
could
hear
the
sound
of
talking
in
low
voices
the
boys
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
statue
where
she
could
not
see
them
let
it
down
easy
she
heard
one
of
them
say
better
get
around
on
the
other
side
said
a
second
voice
the
boy
thus
spoken
to
moved
around
until
he
was
directly
before
the
opening
in
front
of
sahwah
eyes
with
a
start
she
recognized
joe
lanning
what
business
had
joe
lanning
on
the
stage
at
this
time
he
was
not
in
the
play
and
he
did
not
belong
to
the
thessalonian
society
there
was
only
one
explanation
joe
was
up
to
some
mischief
again
she
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
other
voice
belonged
to
abraham
goldstein
and
thus
indeed
it
proved
for
a
moment
later
he
moved
around
so
as
to
come
into
range
of
her
vision
the
two
withdrew
a
few
paces
and
looked
at
the
statue
holding
a
hasty
colloquy
in
inaudible
tones
and
then
joe
mounting
a
chair
laid
hold
of
the
maid
just
above
the
waist
line
while
abraham
seized
the
wooden
base
sahwah
felt
her
head
going
down
and
her
feet
going
up
the
boys
were
carrying
the
statue
off
the
stage
and
out
through
the
back
entrance
over
the
little
bridge
at
the
back
of
the
stage
and
into
the
hall
it
was
the
queerest
ride
sahwah
had
ever
taken
the
boys
paused
before
the
elevator
which
seemed
to
be
standing
ready
with
the
door
open
will
she
go
in
asked
abraham
i
afraid
not
answered
joe
well
have
to
carry
her
downstairs
sahwah
shuddered
would
she
go
down
head
first
or
feet
first
they
carried
her
head
first
and
she
was
dizzy
with
the
rush
of
blood
to
her
head
before
the
two
long
flights
were
accomplished
at
the
foot
of
the
last
flight
they
laid
the
statue
down
the
hall
was
in
total
darkness
what
are
you
doing
asked
the
voice
of
joe
abraham
was
apparently
producing
something
from
somewhere
in
a
minute
joe
was
laughing
good
stunt
he
said
approvingly
where
did
you
get
them
swiped
them
out
of
room
where
all
the
stuff
for
the
play
is
joe
flashed
a
small
pocket
electric
light
and
by
its
glimmer
sahwah
could
see
him
adjusting
a
false
beard
the
one
that
was
to
be
worn
by
the
villain
in
the
play
abraham
was
apparently
disguising
himself
in
a
similar
fashion
this
accomplished
they
picked
up
the
statue
again
and
carried
it
down
the
half
flight
of
stairs
to
the
back
entrance
of
the
school
for
some
mysterious
reason
this
door
was
open
just
outside
stood
an
automobile
truck
at
the
back
of
the
school
lay
the
wide
athletic
field
extending
for
several
acres
the
nearest
street
was
all
of
four
blocks
away
in
the
darkness
it
was
impossible
to
see
across
this
stretch
of
space
and
distinguish
the
actions
of
the
two
conspirators
in
the
event
people
should
be
passing
along
this
street
even
if
the
truck
itself
were
seen
that
would
cause
no
comment
for
deliveries
were
constantly
being
made
at
the
rear
entrance
of
the
school
the
statue
was
lifted
into
the
truck
covered
with
a
piece
of
canvas
and
joe
and
abraham
sprang
to
the
driver
seat
and
started
the
machine
sahwah
very
nearly
suffocated
under
that
canvas
fortunately
the
ride
was
a
short
one
in
about
seven
or
eight
minutes
she
felt
the
bump
as
they
turned
into
a
driveway
and
then
the
truck
came
to
a
stop
the
boys
jumped
down
from
the
seat
opened
a
door
which
slid
back
with
a
scraping
noise
like
a
barn
door
and
then
lifted
the
statue
from
the
truck
and
carried
it
into
a
building
from
the
light
of
their
pocket
flashes
sahwah
could
make
out
that
she
was
in
a
barn
which
was
evidently
unused
it
was
entirely
empty
setting
the
statue
in
a
corner
the
boys
went
out
closing
the
door
after
them
sahwah
was
left
in
total
darkness
and
in
a
ten
times
worse
position
than
she
had
been
in
before
on
the
stage
at
school
there
was
some
hope
of
the
statue
being
opened
eventually
but
here
she
could
remain
for
weeks
before
being
discovered
sahwah
began
to
wonder
just
how
long
she
could
hold
out
before
she
starved
she
was
hungry
already
she
closed
her
eyes
with
weariness
from
her
strained
position
and
it
is
possible
that
she
dozed
off
for
a
few
moments
in
fact
that
was
what
she
did
do
she
dreamed
that
she
was
at
the
circus
and
all
the
wild
animals
had
broken
loose
and
were
running
about
the
audience
she
could
hear
the
roar
of
the
lions
and
the
screeching
of
the
tigers
she
woke
up
with
a
start
and
thought
for
a
moment
that
her
dream
was
true
the
barn
was
full
of
wild
animals
which
were
roaring
and
chasing
each
other
around
then
her
senses
cleared
and
she
recognized
the
heavy
bark
of
a
large
dog
and
the
startled
of
a
cat
the
dog
was
chasing
the
cat
around
the
barn
she
felt
the
slight
thud
as
the
cat
leaped
up
and
found
refuge
on
top
of
the
statue
she
could
hear
it
spitting
at
the
dog
and
knew
that
its
back
was
arched
in
an
attitude
of
defiance
the
dog
barked
furiously
down
below
then
overcome
by
rage
he
made
a
wild
jump
for
the
cat
and
lunged
his
heavy
body
against
the
side
of
the
statue
it
toppled
over
against
the
corner
for
an
instant
sahwah
thought
she
was
going
to
be
killed
but
the
corner
of
the
barn
saved
the
statue
from
falling
over
altogether
it
simply
leaned
back
at
a
slight
angle
but
there
was
something
different
in
her
position
now
at
first
she
did
not
know
what
it
was
before
this
her
feet
were
standing
squarely
on
the
wooden
base
of
the
statue
but
now
they
were
slipping
around
and
seemed
to
be
dangling
then
she
realized
what
had
happened
the
shock
of
the
dog
onslaught
had
knocked
the
statue
clear
off
the
base
and
had
also
contrived
to
loosen
her
knees
a
little
to
her
joy
she
found
that
she
could
move
her
feet
could
walk
for
all
the
statue
was
immense
it
was
light
and
wedged
into
it
as
she
was
she
balanced
the
upper
part
of
it
perfectly
she
moved
out
from
the
corner
the
dog
was
still
barking
furiously
and
circling
around
the
barn
after
the
cat
then
the
cat
found
a
paneless
window
by
which
she
had
entered
and
disappeared
into
the
night
the
dog
who
had
also
entered
by
that
window
when
chasing
the
cat
had
been
helped
on
the
outside
by
a
box
which
stood
under
the
sill
but
there
was
no
such
aid
on
the
inside
and
he
did
not
attempt
to
make
the
jump
from
the
floor
but
stood
barking
until
the
place
shook
just
then
a
voice
was
heard
on
the
outside
lion
lion
it
called
where
are
you
lion
barked
in
answer
come
out
of
that
barn
commanded
the
voice
of
a
small
boy
lion
answered
again
in
the
only
way
he
knew
how
wait
a
minute
lion
i
coming
said
the
small
boy
sahwah
heard
some
one
fumbling
at
the
door
and
then
it
was
drawn
open
the
light
from
a
street
lamp
streamed
in
it
fell
directly
on
the
statue
as
sahwah
took
another
step
forward
the
boy
saw
the
apparition
and
fled
in
terror
followed
by
the
dog
leaving
the
door
wide
open
sahwah
hastened
to
the
door
here
she
encountered
a
difficulty
the
statue
was
nine
feet
high
and
the
door
was
only
about
eight
naturally
the
statue
could
not
bend
it
had
been
carried
in
in
a
horizontal
position
sahwah
reflected
a
moment
her
powers
of
observation
were
remarkably
good
and
she
could
sense
things
that
went
on
around
her
without
having
to
see
them
she
had
noticed
that
when
the
boys
carried
the
statue
into
the
barn
they
had
had
to
climb
up
into
the
doorway
the
inclined
entrance
approach
had
undoubtedly
rotted
away
she
figured
that
this
step
up
had
been
a
foot
at
least
her
ingenious
mind
told
her
that
by
standing
close
to
the
edge
of
the
doorway
and
jumping
down
she
would
come
clear
of
the
doorway
she
put
this
theory
to
trial
immediately
the
scheme
worked
she
landed
on
her
feet
on
the
ground
with
the
top
of
the
statue
free
in
the
air
as
fast
as
she
could
she
made
her
way
up
the
driveway
her
hands
were
still
pinioned
at
her
sides
as
she
passed
the
house
in
front
of
the
barn
she
could
see
by
the
street
light
that
it
was
empty
a
grand
scheme
it
would
have
been
indeed
if
it
had
worked
hiding
the
statue
in
the
unused
barn
where
it
would
not
have
been
discovered
for
weeks
or
possibly
months
of
course
sahwah
readily
admitted
joe
did
not
know
that
she
was
in
the
statue
his
object
had
merely
been
to
spoil
the
play
and
a
very
effective
method
he
had
taken
too
for
the
play
without
the
statue
of
joan
of
arc
would
have
been
nothing
sahwah
stood
still
on
the
street
and
tried
to
get
her
bearings
she
was
in
an
unfamiliar
neighborhood
she
walked
up
the
street
coming
toward
her
was
a
man
sahwah
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
without
a
doubt
he
would
see
the
trouble
she
was
in
and
free
her
now
sahwah
did
not
know
it
but
in
the
scramble
with
the
dog
the
button
had
been
pushed
which
worked
the
halo
the
neighborhood
she
was
in
was
largely
inhabited
by
foreigners
and
the
man
coming
toward
her
was
a
hungarian
who
had
not
been
long
in
this
country
taking
his
way
homeward
with
never
a
thought
in
his
mind
but
his
dinner
he
suddenly
looked
up
to
see
the
gigantic
figure
of
a
woman
bearing
down
on
him
brandishing
a
gleaming
sword
and
with
a
dim
halo
playing
around
her
head
for
an
instant
he
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
and
then
with
a
wild
yell
he
ran
across
the
street
darted
between
two
houses
and
disappeared
over
the
back
fence
then
began
a
series
of
encounters
which
threw
sahwah
into
hysterics
twenty
years
later
when
she
happened
to
remember
them
intent
only
on
her
own
liberation
she
was
at
the
time
unconscious
of
the
terrifying
figure
she
presented
and
hastened
along
at
the
top
of
her
speed
everywhere
the
people
fled
before
her
in
the
extremity
of
terror
on
all
sides
she
could
hear
shrieks
of
war
war
it
is
a
sign
of
war
in
one
street
through
which
she
passed
lived
a
simple
slovak
priest
he
was
sorely
torn
over
the
sad
conflict
raging
in
europe
and
was
undecided
whether
he
should
preach
a
sermon
advocating
peace
at
all
costs
or
preparation
for
fighting
he
debated
the
question
back
and
forth
in
his
mind
and
unable
to
come
to
any
decision
in
the
narrow
confines
of
his
little
house
walked
up
and
down
on
the
cold
porch
seeking
for
light
in
the
matter
oh
for
a
sign
from
heaven
he
sighed
such
as
came
to
the
saints
of
old
to
solve
their
troublesome
questions
scarcely
had
the
wish
passed
through
his
mind
when
a
vision
appeared
down
the
dark
street
came
rushing
the
heroic
image
of
joan
of
arc
with
sword
uplifted
her
head
shining
with
the
refulgence
of
the
halo
at
his
gate
she
paused
and
stood
a
long
time
looking
at
him
sahwah
thought
that
he
would
come
down
and
help
her
out
instead
he
fell
on
his
knees
on
the
porch
and
bowed
his
head
crying
out
something
in
a
foreign
tongue
seeing
that
expectation
of
help
from
that
quarter
was
useless
sahwah
ran
on
and
turned
a
nearby
corner
when
the
priest
lifted
his
head
again
the
vision
was
gone
it
is
to
be
war
then
he
muttered
i
have
a
divine
command
to
bid
my
people
take
up
arms
in
battle
this
was
the
origin
of
the
military
demonstration
which
took
place
in
the
slovak
settlement
the
following
sunday
which
ended
in
such
serious
rioting
sahwah
running
onward
suddenly
found
herself
in
the
very
middle
of
the
road
where
two
carlines
crossed
each
other
this
was
a
very
congested
corner
and
a
policeman
was
stationed
there
to
direct
the
traffic
this
policeman
however
on
this
cold
february
day
found
mike
saloon
on
the
corner
a
much
pleasanter
place
than
the
middle
of
the
road
and
paid
one
visit
after
another
while
the
traffic
directed
itself
this
last
time
he
had
stayed
inside
much
longer
than
he
had
intended
to
having
become
involved
in
an
argument
with
the
proprietor
of
the
place
and
coming
to
himself
with
a
guilty
start
he
hurried
out
to
resume
his
duties
on
the
sidewalk
he
stood
as
if
paralyzed
in
the
middle
of
the
road
in
his
place
stood
an
enormously
tall
woman
directing
the
traffic
with
a
gleaming
sword
mother
av
hiven
he
muttered
superstitiously
it
one
of
the
saints
come
down
to
look
after
the
job
i
jumped
and
waiting
to
strike
me
dead
when
i
come
back
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
fled
up
the
street
without
once
looking
over
his
shoulder
and
thus
sahwah
went
from
place
to
place
vainly
looking
for
some
one
who
would
pull
her
out
of
the
statue
and
leaving
everywhere
she
went
a
trail
of
superstitious
terror
such
as
had
never
been
known
in
the
annals
of
the
city
for
a
week
the
papers
were
full
of
the
mysterious
appearance
of
the
armed
woman
which
was
taken
as
a
presumptive
augury
of
war
many
affirmed
that
she
had
stopped
them
on
the
street
and
commanded
them
in
tones
of
thunder
to
take
up
arms
to
save
the
country
from
destruction
and
promising
to
lead
them
to
victory
when
the
time
for
battle
came
many
of
the
foreigners
believed
to
their
dying
day
that
they
had
seen
a
vision
from
heaven
sahwah
at
last
got
her
bearings
and
found
that
she
was
not
a
great
distance
from
the
school
so
she
took
her
way
thither
where
she
might
encounter
some
one
who
was
connected
with
the
play
and
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
statue
a
secret
which
was
being
closely
guarded
from
the
public
that
the
effect
might
be
greater
she
nearly
wept
with
joy
when
she
saw
dick
albright
just
about
to
enter
the
building
although
he
was
startled
almost
out
of
a
year
growth
at
the
sight
of
the
statue
which
he
supposed
to
be
standing
on
the
stage
in
the
building
running
up
the
front
steps
after
him
he
did
not
disappear
into
space
as
had
all
of
the
others
she
had
met
after
the
first
fright
he
suspected
some
practical
joke
and
stood
still
to
see
what
would
happen
next
sahwah
knew
that
the
only
thing
visible
of
her
was
her
feet
and
that
she
could
not
explain
matters
with
her
voice
so
coming
close
to
dick
she
stretched
out
her
foot
as
far
as
possible
now
sahwah
with
her
riotous
love
of
color
had
bright
red
buttons
on
her
black
shoes
the
only
set
like
them
in
the
school
dick
recognized
the
buttons
and
knew
that
it
was
sahwah
in
the
statue
he
still
thought
she
was
playing
a
joke
and
laughed
uproariously
sahwah
grew
desperate
she
must
make
him
understand
that
she
wanted
him
to
pull
her
out
the
broad
stone
terrace
before
the
door
was
covered
with
a
light
fall
of
snow
with
the
point
of
her
toe
she
traced
in
the
snow
the
words
pull
me
out
dick
now
took
in
the
situation
he
opened
the
door
of
the
statue
and
with
some
difficulty
succeeded
in
extricating
sahwah
from
her
precarious
position
together
they
carried
the
maid
into
the
building
and
up
the
stairs
and
set
her
in
place
on
the
stage
she
had
just
been
missed
by
the
arriving
players
and
the
place
was
in
an
uproar
sahwah
told
what
had
happened
that
afternoon
and
the
adventures
she
had
had
in
getting
back
to
the
school
while
her
listeners
exclaimed
incredulously
there
was
no
longer
time
to
go
home
for
supper
so
sahwah
ran
off
to
the
green
room
to
begin
making
up
for
her
part
in
the
play
chapter
x
who
cut
the
wire
the
house
was
packed
on
this
the
first
night
of
the
thessalonian
play
it
was
already
long
past
time
for
the
performance
to
begin
the
orchestra
finished
the
overture
and
waited
a
few
minutes
then
began
another
selection
they
played
this
through
and
there
was
still
no
indication
of
the
curtain
going
up
they
played
a
third
piece
the
house
became
restless
and
began
to
clap
for
the
appearance
of
the
performers
no
sign
from
the
stage
behind
the
curtain
there
was
pandemonium
when
everything
was
about
ready
to
begin
it
was
discovered
that
none
of
the
stage
lights
would
work
neither
the
foot
lights
nor
the
big
cluster
up
over
the
center
of
the
stage
nor
any
of
the
side
lights
could
be
turned
on
a
hasty
examination
of
the
wiring
led
to
the
discovery
that
the
wires
which
supplied
the
current
had
been
cut
in
the
room
where
the
switchboard
was
the
plaster
had
been
broken
into
in
order
to
reach
them
this
was
the
reason
that
the
play
was
not
beginning
the
president
of
the
thessalonians
came
out
in
front
and
explained
to
the
audience
that
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
lights
which
would
cause
a
delay
in
the
rising
of
the
curtain
but
the
trouble
was
being
fixed
and
he
begged
the
indulgence
of
the
house
for
a
few
minutes
the
orchestra
filled
in
the
time
by
playing
lively
marches
while
the
boys
behind
the
scenes
worked
feverishly
to
mend
the
severed
wires
and
the
curtain
went
up
a
whole
hour
after
scheduled
time
the
first
act
went
off
famously
gladys
was
a
born
actress
and
sustained
the
difficult
role
of
well
the
part
where
she
defies
her
tyrannical
father
brought
down
the
house
sahwah
came
in
for
her
share
of
applause
too
seeing
her
composed
manner
and
hearing
her
calm
voice
no
one
in
the
audience
could
ever
have
guessed
the
strenuous
experience
she
had
just
been
through
in
the
second
scene
marie
driven
from
her
home
wanders
around
in
the
streets
with
her
child
until
faint
from
hunger
she
sinks
to
the
ground
the
scene
is
laid
before
the
wall
of
her
father
large
estate
and
she
falls
at
his
very
gates
gladys
made
the
scene
very
realistic
and
the
audience
sat
tense
and
sympathetic
moaned
marie
latour
a
crust
to
keep
the
life
in
me
and
my
child
she
lay
weakly
in
the
road
unable
to
rise
she
moaned
again
at
this
moment
there
suddenly
descended
as
from
the
very
heavens
a
ham
sandwich
on
the
end
of
a
string
it
dangled
within
an
inch
of
her
nose
gladys
was
petrified
the
audience
sat
up
in
surprise
and
a
ripple
of
laughter
ran
through
the
house
it
was
such
an
unexpected
anticlimax
that
some
one
was
playing
a
practical
joke
gladys
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
and
she
was
furious
at
this
ridiculous
interruption
of
her
big
scene
in
the
play
marie
loses
consciousness
and
is
found
by
a
peasant
and
it
is
on
this
occurrence
that
the
rest
of
the
play
hinges
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
ham
sandwich
in
response
to
her
cry
for
food
was
fatal
to
the
pathos
of
the
scene
the
rest
of
the
cast
standing
in
the
wings
saw
what
had
happened
and
were
at
their
wits
end
but
gladys
was
equal
to
the
occasion
moving
her
head
wearily
and
passing
her
hand
over
her
eyes
she
murmured
faintly
but
audibly
cruel
cruel
mirage
to
taunt
me
thus
vanish
thou
image
of
a
fevered
brain
thou
absurd
memory
come
not
to
mock
me
the
actors
in
the
wings
taking
their
cue
from
her
speech
found
the
string
to
which
the
sandwich
was
tied
and
jerked
it
the
sandwich
vanished
from
the
sight
of
the
audience
the
scene
was
saved
the
spectators
simply
passed
it
over
as
a
more
or
less
clumsy
attempt
to
portray
a
vision
of
a
disordered
brain
the
string
on
the
sandwich
had
been
passed
over
certain
rigging
above
the
stage
that
moved
the
scenery
and
on
through
a
little
ventilator
that
came
out
on
the
fourth
floor
from
which
point
the
manipulator
had
been
able
to
listen
to
the
speeches
on
the
stage
and
time
the
drop
of
the
sandwich
by
the
time
the
thessalonian
boys
had
traced
the
string
to
its
end
the
perpetrator
of
the
joke
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
had
fled
as
soon
as
the
thing
had
been
lowered
the
scene
ended
without
further
calamity
in
the
third
scene
the
one
in
the
peasant
hut
there
is
a
cat
on
the
stage
the
presence
of
this
cat
was
the
signal
for
further
trouble
in
one
of
the
tense
passages
where
marie
latour
is
pleading
with
the
son
of
the
peasant
to
flee
for
his
life
before
the
agents
of
her
father
come
and
capture
them
both
and
the
cat
lies
asleep
on
the
hearth
there
was
a
sudden
uproar
and
a
dog
bounded
through
the
entrance
of
the
stage
the
cat
rushed
around
in
terror
and
finally
ran
up
the
curtain
the
lovers
parted
hastily
and
tried
to
capture
the
dog
but
eluding
their
pursuit
he
jumped
over
the
footlights
into
the
orchestra
landing
with
a
crash
on
the
keys
of
the
piano
and
then
out
into
the
audience
nyoda
and
three
or
four
of
the
winnebagos
sitting
together
near
the
front
on
the
first
floor
of
the
auditorium
recognized
the
dog
with
a
good
deal
of
surprise
it
was
bob
hinpoha
black
cocker
spaniel
how
he
had
gotten
in
was
a
mystery
for
hinpoha
herself
was
not
there
nyoda
called
to
him
sharply
and
he
came
to
her
wagging
his
tail
and
allowed
himself
to
be
put
out
with
the
best
nature
in
the
world
but
the
scene
had
been
spoiled
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
nyoda
as
well
as
a
number
of
the
other
teachers
sat
with
brows
knitted
going
over
the
various
things
that
had
happened
to
interrupt
that
play
as
yet
they
did
not
know
about
the
attempt
to
steal
the
statue
which
sahwah
had
accidentally
nipped
in
the
bud
but
the
following
week
when
the
play
was
all
over
and
the
various
occurrences
had
been
made
known
there
was
a
day
of
reckoning
at
washington
high
school
joe
lanning
and
abraham
goldstein
were
called
up
before
the
principal
and
confronted
with
sahwah
who
told
to
their
infinite
amazement
every
move
they
had
made
in
carrying
off
the
statue
at
first
they
denied
everything
as
a
story
gotten
up
to
spite
them
but
when
sahwah
led
the
way
to
the
barn
where
she
had
been
confined
and
triumphantly
produced
the
base
of
the
statue
they
saw
that
further
denial
was
useless
and
admitted
their
guilt
they
also
confessed
to
being
the
authors
of
the
sandwich
joke
and
the
ones
who
had
brought
in
the
dog
both
were
expelled
from
school
but
the
thing
which
the
principal
and
teachers
considered
the
bigger
crime
the
cutting
of
the
wires
at
the
back
of
the
stage
was
still
a
mystery
joe
and
abraham
complicity
in
the
statue
affair
furnished
them
with
a
complete
alibi
in
regard
to
the
other
it
was
proven
beyond
a
doubt
that
they
had
not
been
in
the
building
in
the
early
part
of
the
afternoon
nor
after
they
had
carried
off
the
statue
until
after
the
wires
had
been
cut
then
who
had
cut
the
wires
that
was
the
question
that
agitated
the
school
it
was
too
big
a
piece
of
vandalism
to
let
slip
the
principal
jackson
was
determined
to
run
down
the
offender
joe
and
abraham
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
affair
and
there
was
no
clue
the
whole
school
was
up
in
arms
about
the
matter
then
things
took
a
rather
unexpected
turn
in
one
of
the
meetings
where
the
matter
was
being
discussed
one
of
the
teachers
wardwell
suddenly
got
to
his
feet
he
had
just
recollected
something
i
remember
he
said
seeing
dorothy
bradford
coming
out
of
the
electric
room
late
on
the
afternoon
of
the
play
she
came
out
twice
once
about
three
and
once
about
four
each
time
she
seemed
embarrassed
about
meeting
me
and
turned
scarlet
there
was
a
murmur
of
surprise
among
the
teachers
nyoda
sat
up
very
straight
the
next
day
hinpoha
was
summoned
to
the
office
unsuspectingly
she
went
she
had
been
summoned
before
always
on
matters
of
more
or
less
congenial
business
she
found
jackson
wardwell
and
nyoda
together
in
the
private
office
miss
bradford
began
jackson
without
preliminary
wardwell
tells
me
he
saw
you
coming
out
of
the
electric
room
on
the
afternoon
of
the
play
in
view
of
what
happened
that
night
the
presence
of
anybody
in
that
room
looks
suspicious
will
you
kindly
state
what
you
did
in
there
nyoda
listened
with
an
untroubled
heart
sure
of
an
innocent
and
convincing
reason
why
hinpoha
had
been
in
that
room
hinpoha
taken
completely
by
surprise
was
speechless
to
nyoda
astonishment
and
dismay
she
turned
fiery
red
hinpoha
always
blushed
at
the
slightest
provocation
in
the
stress
of
the
moment
she
could
not
think
of
a
single
excuse
for
having
gone
into
the
electric
room
telling
the
real
reason
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
because
she
had
promised
to
shield
emily
meeks
i
left
something
in
there
she
stammered
and
went
back
after
it
you
carried
nothing
in
your
hands
either
time
when
you
came
out
said
wardwell
hinpoha
was
struck
dumb
she
was
a
poor
hand
at
deception
and
was
totally
unable
to
bluff
anything
through
i
did
say
i
carried
anything
out
she
said
in
an
agitated
voice
i
went
in
after
something
and
it
was
there
what
was
it
asked
jackson
i
ca
tell
you
said
hinpoha
how
did
you
happen
to
leave
anything
in
the
electric
room
persisted
jackson
what
were
you
doing
in
there
in
the
first
place
i
went
in
to
see
if
i
had
left
something
there
said
poor
hinpoha
floundering
desperately
in
the
attempt
to
tell
a
plausible
tale
and
yet
not
lie
deliberately
then
realizing
that
she
was
contradicting
herself
and
getting
more
involved
all
the
time
she
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
sat
silent
and
miserable
nyoda
expression
of
amazement
and
concern
was
an
added
torture
you
admit
then
that
you
were
in
the
electric
room
twice
on
thursday
afternoon
doing
something
which
you
can
not
explain
said
jackson
slowly
hinpoha
nodded
mutely
she
never
for
an
instant
wavered
in
her
loyalty
to
emily
there
is
another
thing
continued
jackson
that
seems
to
point
to
the
fact
that
you
were
in
league
with
those
who
wished
to
spoil
the
play
it
was
your
dog
that
was
let
out
on
the
stage
in
pursuit
of
the
cat
i
know
it
was
said
hinpoha
feeling
that
she
was
being
drawn
helplessly
into
a
net
from
which
there
was
no
escape
but
that
my
fault
i
have
the
slightest
idea
how
he
got
there
it
was
pure
chance
that
he
was
coaxed
into
the
building
that
may
all
be
said
jackson
with
frowning
wrinkles
around
the
corners
of
his
eyes
but
it
looks
suspicious
you
certainly
do
think
i
cut
those
wires
do
you
said
hinpoha
incredulously
jackson
looked
wise
you
were
not
at
the
play
yourself
were
you
he
asked
no
answered
hinpoha
why
were
you
pursued
jackson
have
you
anything
against
the
thessalonian
society
no
not
at
all
said
hinpoha
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
i
am
not
going
to
anything
this
winter
she
looked
down
at
her
black
dress
expressively
not
trusting
her
voice
to
speak
further
continued
jackson
you
were
seen
in
the
company
of
joe
lanning
the
day
before
these
things
happened
now
hinpoha
had
walked
home
from
school
with
joe
that
wednesday
she
had
done
it
merely
because
she
was
too
courteous
to
snub
him
flatly
when
he
had
caught
up
with
her
on
the
street
she
despised
him
just
as
the
rest
of
the
class
did
and
avoided
him
whenever
she
could
but
when
brought
face
to
face
with
him
she
had
not
the
hardihood
to
refuse
his
company
that
this
innocent
act
should
be
misconstrued
into
meaning
that
she
was
mixed
up
in
his
doings
seemed
monstrous
yet
jackson
apparently
believed
this
to
be
the
truth
things
seemed
to
be
closing
around
her
to
jackson
her
guilt
was
perfectly
clear
she
was
a
friend
of
joe
lanning
she
had
lent
him
her
dog
to
work
mischief
on
the
stage
she
admitted
being
in
the
electric
room
and
refused
to
tell
what
she
had
been
doing
there
well
he
said
crisply
somebody
cut
those
wires
thursday
afternoon
and
only
one
person
was
seen
going
in
and
out
of
the
electric
room
during
that
time
and
that
person
is
yourself
you
admit
that
you
were
in
there
doing
something
which
will
not
bear
explanation
it
looks
pretty
suspicious
does
it
i
did
do
it
hinpoha
declared
stoutly
in
her
distress
she
did
not
dare
meet
nyoda
eyes
what
was
nyoda
thinking
of
her
anyhow
and
so
continued
jackson
not
heeding
her
denial
until
you
can
give
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
your
presence
in
the
electric
room
last
thursday
i
must
consider
that
you
had
something
to
do
with
the
cutting
of
those
wires
i
have
been
asked
by
the
board
of
education
to
look
into
the
matter
thoroughly
and
to
punish
the
culprit
with
expulsion
from
school
as
all
evidence
points
to
you
as
the
guilty
person
i
shall
be
obliged
under
the
circumstances
to
expel
you
hinpoha
sat
as
if
turned
to
stone
the
wild
beating
of
her
heart
almost
suffocated
her
expelled
from
school
but
even
with
that
terrible
sentence
ringing
in
her
ears
it
never
entered
her
head
to
betray
emily
if
this
was
to
be
the
price
of
loyalty
then
she
would
pay
the
price
there
was
no
other
way
she
had
not
been
clever
enough
to
explain
her
presence
in
the
electric
room
to
the
satisfaction
of
jackson
and
yet
breathe
no
word
of
the
real
situation
and
this
was
the
result
her
head
whirled
from
the
sudden
calamity
which
had
overwhelmed
her
her
thoughts
were
chaos
she
hardly
heard
when
jackson
said
curtly
you
may
go
as
one
in
a
dream
she
walked
out
of
the
office
nyoda
came
out
with
her
of
all
things
said
wardwell
to
jackson
when
they
were
left
alone
to
think
that
a
girl
should
have
done
that
thing
it
seems
strange
too
mused
jackson
that
she
should
have
been
able
to
do
it
you
would
hardly
look
for
a
girl
to
be
cutting
electric
wires
would
you
it
takes
some
skill
to
do
that
where
did
she
learn
how
to
do
it
those
camp
fire
girls
said
wardwell
emphatically
know
everything
i
do
know
where
they
learn
it
but
they
do
nyoda
led
hinpoha
into
one
of
the
empty
club
rooms
and
sat
down
beside
her
now
my
dear
she
said
quietly
will
you
please
tell
me
the
whole
story
it
is
absurd
of
course
to
accuse
you
of
cutting
those
wires
but
what
were
you
doing
in
that
room
all
you
have
to
do
is
give
a
satisfactory
explanation
and
the
accusation
will
be
withdrawn
nyoda
voice
was
friendly
and
sympathetic
and
it
was
a
sore
temptation
to
hinpoha
to
tell
her
the
whole
thing
just
as
it
happened
but
she
had
promised
emily
not
to
tell
a
living
soul
and
a
promise
was
a
promise
with
hinpoha
nyoda
she
said
steadily
i
in
that
electric
room
twice
on
thursday
afternoon
i
carried
something
in
and
i
carried
it
out
again
but
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
was
not
even
to
save
yourself
from
being
expelled
asked
nyoda
curiously
not
even
to
save
myself
from
being
expelled
said
hinpoha
steadfastly
and
nyoda
baffled
gave
it
up
but
of
one
thing
she
was
sure
whatever
silly
thing
hinpoha
had
done
that
she
was
ashamed
to
confess
she
had
never
in
the
world
cut
those
wires
it
was
simply
impossible
for
her
to
have
done
such
a
thing
entirely
convinced
on
this
point
nyoda
went
back
to
jackson
and
told
him
her
belief
begging
him
not
to
put
his
threat
of
expulsion
into
execution
but
jackson
was
obdurate
there
was
something
under
the
surface
of
which
nyoda
knew
nothing
all
the
year
there
had
been
a
certain
lawless
element
in
the
school
which
was
continually
breaking
out
in
open
defiance
of
law
and
order
jackson
had
been
totally
unable
to
cope
with
the
situation
he
had
been
severely
criticised
for
not
having
succeeded
in
stamping
out
this
disorder
and
was
accused
of
not
being
able
to
control
his
scholars
the
events
connected
with
the
giving
of
the
play
had
been
widely
published
it
was
impossible
to
keep
them
a
secret
and
jackson
had
been
taken
to
task
by
those
above
him
in
the
educational
department
for
not
being
able
to
find
out
who
had
cut
the
wires
smarting
under
this
censure
he
had
determined
to
fix
the
blame
at
an
early
date
at
all
costs
and
when
the
opportunity
came
of
fastening
a
suspicion
onto
hinpoha
he
had
seized
it
eagerly
and
intended
to
publish
far
and
wide
that
he
had
found
the
guilty
one
therefore
he
met
nyoda
appeal
with
stony
indifference
i
shall
consider
her
guilty
until
she
has
proven
her
innocence
he
maintained
obstinately
and
you
will
find
that
i
am
right
that
is
nothing
but
a
story
about
going
in
there
for
something
she
had
left
you
noticed
how
she
contradicted
herself
half
a
dozen
times
in
as
many
minutes
she
is
the
guilty
one
all
right
and
in
sore
distress
nyoda
left
him
the
axe
fell
and
hinpoha
was
expelled
from
school
if
lightning
had
fallen
on
a
clear
day
and
cleft
the
roof
open
the
pupils
could
not
have
been
more
dumbfounded
hinpoha
was
the
very
last
one
any
one
would
have
suspected
of
cutting
wires
in
fact
many
were
openly
incredulous
but
jackson
took
care
to
make
all
the
damaging
facts
public
and
hinpoha
fair
name
was
dragged
in
the
mud
emily
meeks
was
one
who
stood
loyal
to
hinpoha
she
was
ignorant
that
it
was
to
shield
her
hinpoha
had
refused
to
tell
what
she
was
doing
in
the
electric
room
as
she
had
gone
home
before
hinpoha
had
retouched
the
picture
but
she
refused
to
believe
that
her
angel
as
she
always
thought
of
hinpoha
could
be
guilty
of
any
wrong
doing
as
for
hinpoha
herself
life
was
not
worth
living
the
scene
with
aunt
phoebe
when
she
heard
of
her
disgrace
was
too
painful
to
record
here
suffice
to
say
that
hinpoha
was
regarded
as
a
criminal
of
the
worst
type
and
was
never
allowed
to
forget
for
one
instant
that
she
had
disgraced
the
name
of
bradford
forever
it
was
awful
not
to
be
going
to
school
and
getting
lessons
those
days
at
home
were
nightmares
that
she
remembered
to
the
end
of
her
life
with
a
shudder
the
only
ray
of
comfort
she
had
was
the
fact
that
nyoda
and
the
winnebagos
stood
by
her
stanchly
i
can
bear
it
she
said
to
nyoda
forlornly
knowing
that
you
believe
in
me
but
if
you
ever
went
back
on
me
i
could
live
nyoda
urged
her
no
more
to
tell
her
secret
for
she
suspected
that
it
concerned
some
one
else
whom
hinpoha
would
not
expose
and
trusted
to
time
to
solve
the
mystery
and
remove
the
stain
from
hinpoha
name
the
excitement
over
school
settled
down
into
its
old
rut
joe
father
sent
him
away
to
military
school
and
abraham
father
began
to
use
his
influence
to
have
him
reinstated
goldstein
put
forth
such
a
touching
plea
about
abraham
having
been
led
astray
by
joe
lanning
and
being
no
more
than
a
tool
in
his
hands
and
abraham
promised
so
faithfully
that
he
would
never
deviate
from
the
path
of
virtue
again
now
that
his
evil
genius
was
removed
if
they
would
only
let
him
come
back
and
graduate
that
he
was
given
the
chance
nothing
new
came
up
about
the
cutting
of
the
wires
except
that
the
end
of
a
knife
blade
was
found
on
the
floor
under
the
place
where
the
hole
had
been
made
in
the
wall
there
were
no
marks
of
identification
on
it
and
nothing
was
done
about
it
one
day
dick
albright
in
the
physics
room
on
the
third
floor
of
the
building
stood
by
the
window
and
looked
across
at
a
friend
of
his
who
was
standing
at
the
window
of
the
chemistry
room
the
two
rooms
faced
each
other
across
an
open
space
in
the
back
of
the
building
which
was
designed
to
let
more
light
into
certain
rooms
this
space
was
only
open
at
the
third
and
fourth
floors
the
second
floor
was
roofed
over
with
a
skylight
at
this
point
it
was
after
school
hours
and
dick
was
alone
in
the
room
so
apparently
was
his
friend
dick
raised
the
window
and
called
across
the
space
to
the
other
boy
who
raised
his
window
and
answered
him
from
talking
back
and
forth
they
passed
to
throwing
a
ball
of
twine
to
each
other
once
dick
failed
to
catch
it
and
falling
short
of
the
window
it
rolled
down
upon
the
roof
of
the
second
story
dick
promptly
climbed
out
of
the
window
and
sliding
down
the
waterspout
reached
the
roof
and
went
in
pursuit
of
the
ball
one
of
the
windows
opening
from
the
third
story
onto
this
open
space
was
that
in
the
electric
room
and
it
was
under
this
window
that
the
ball
came
to
a
standstill
as
dick
stooped
to
pick
it
up
he
found
a
knife
lying
beside
it
he
brought
it
along
with
him
and
climbed
back
into
his
room
then
he
pulled
it
out
and
looked
at
it
it
was
an
ordinary
pocket
knife
with
a
horn
handle
on
one
side
of
the
handle
there
was
a
plate
bearing
the
name
boyd
frank
boyd
knife
said
dick
to
himself
he
must
have
dropped
it
out
of
the
window
idly
he
opened
the
blade
it
was
broken
off
about
half
an
inch
from
the
point
dick
began
to
turn
things
over
in
his
mind
a
piece
of
a
knife
blade
had
been
found
in
the
electric
room
a
knife
with
a
broken
blade
had
been
found
on
the
roof
under
the
window
of
the
electric
room
that
knife
belonged
to
frank
boyd
the
inference
was
very
simple
frank
had
climbed
in
the
window
of
the
electric
room
from
the
roof
of
the
second
story
and
cut
the
wires
and
then
climbed
out
again
and
so
was
not
seen
coming
out
of
the
room
into
the
hall
in
climbing
out
he
had
dropped
the
knife
without
noticing
it
he
had
already
left
a
piece
of
the
blade
inside
frank
boyd
was
one
of
the
lawless
spirits
who
had
caused
much
of
the
trouble
all
through
the
year
he
had
also
been
blackballed
at
the
last
election
of
the
thessalonian
society
it
was
very
easy
to
believe
that
he
would
try
to
do
something
to
spite
the
thessalonians
dick
hastened
down
to
jackson
office
with
the
knife
and
asked
him
to
fit
the
broken
piece
to
the
shortened
blade
it
fitted
perfectly
beyond
a
doubt
it
was
frank
boyd
and
not
hinpoha
who
had
cut
the
wires
in
the
electric
room
the
next
morning
frank
was
confronted
with
the
evidence
of
the
knife
and
confessed
his
guilt
he
had
been
in
league
with
joe
lanning
and
cutting
the
wires
had
been
his
part
of
the
job
he
had
done
it
in
the
early
part
of
the
evening
while
the
actors
were
making
up
for
their
parts
getting
in
and
out
of
the
window
just
as
dick
had
figured
out
no
one
had
detected
him
in
the
act
and
the
lucky
incident
of
hinpoha
having
been
seen
coming
out
of
the
electric
room
turned
all
suspicion
away
from
him
justice
in
his
case
was
tardy
but
certain
and
frank
boyd
was
expelled
and
hinpoha
was
reinstated
jackson
in
his
elation
over
having
caught
the
real
culprit
and
effectually
breaking
up
the
rowdy
ring
was
gracious
enough
to
make
a
public
apology
to
hinpoha
so
the
blot
was
wiped
off
her
scutcheon
and
emily
secret
was
still
intact
for
no
one
ever
asked
again
what
hinpoha
had
been
doing
in
the
electric
room
on
the
afternoon
of
the
thessalonian
play
chapter
xi
another
coasting
party
this
is
the
terrible
hunger
moon
the
lean
gray
wolf
can
hardly
bay
quoted
hinpoha
as
she
threw
out
a
handful
of
crumbs
for
the
birds
the
ground
was
covered
with
ice
and
snow
and
the
wintry
winds
whistled
through
the
bare
trees
in
the
yard
ruffling
up
the
feathers
of
the
poor
little
sparrows
huddling
on
the
branches
gladys
stood
beside
hinpoha
watching
the
hungry
little
winter
citizens
flying
hastily
down
to
their
feast
what
is
bob
barking
at
she
asked
pausing
to
listen
i
go
and
find
out
said
hinpoha
from
the
porch
she
could
see
bob
standing
under
an
evergreen
tree
in
the
back
yard
barking
up
at
it
with
all
his
might
hinpoha
came
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
hush
bob
she
commanded
throwing
a
snowball
at
him
she
picked
her
way
through
the
deep
snow
to
the
tree
oh
gladys
come
here
she
called
gladys
came
out
and
joined
her
what
is
it
she
asked
huddled
up
in
the
low
branches
of
the
tree
was
a
great
ghostly
looking
bird
white
as
the
snow
under
their
feet
its
eyes
were
closed
and
it
was
apparently
asleep
hinpoha
stretched
out
her
hand
and
touched
its
feathers
it
woke
up
with
a
start
and
looked
at
her
with
great
round
eyes
full
of
alarm
it
an
owl
said
hinpoha
in
amazement
a
snowy
owl
it
must
have
flown
across
the
lake
from
canada
they
do
sometimes
when
the
food
is
scarce
and
the
cold
too
intense
up
there
the
owl
blinked
and
closed
his
eyes
again
the
glare
of
the
sun
on
the
snow
blinded
him
he
acted
stupid
and
half
frozen
and
sat
crouched
close
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
making
no
effort
to
fly
away
how
tame
he
is
said
gladys
he
does
seem
to
mind
us
in
the
least
hinpoha
tried
to
stroke
him
but
he
jerked
away
and
tumbled
to
the
ground
one
wing
was
apparently
broken
bob
made
a
leap
for
the
bird
as
he
fell
but
hinpoha
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
dragged
him
into
the
house
when
she
returned
the
owl
was
making
desperate
efforts
to
get
up
into
the
tree
again
by
jumping
but
without
success
hinpoha
caught
him
easily
in
spite
of
his
struggles
and
bore
him
into
the
house
there
was
an
empty
cage
down
in
the
cellar
which
had
once
housed
a
parrot
and
into
this
the
creature
was
put
that
wing
will
heal
again
and
then
we
can
let
him
go
said
hinpoha
had
it
better
be
tied
down
suggested
gladys
he
flutters
it
so
much
with
infinite
pains
hinpoha
tied
the
broken
wing
down
to
the
bird
side
using
strips
of
gauze
bandage
for
the
purpose
the
owl
made
no
sound
they
fixed
a
perch
in
the
cage
and
he
stepped
decorously
up
on
it
and
regarded
them
with
an
intense
mournful
gaze
is
he
spooky
looking
said
gladys
shivering
and
turning
away
he
gives
me
the
creeps
what
will
we
feed
him
asked
hinpoha
do
owls
eat
crumbs
asked
gladys
hinpoha
shook
her
head
that
is
enough
i
always
read
that
they
catch
mice
and
things
like
that
to
eat
she
brightened
up
there
are
several
mice
in
the
trap
now
i
saw
them
when
i
brought
up
the
cage
she
sped
down
cellar
and
returned
with
three
mice
in
a
trap
ugh
said
gladys
in
disgust
as
hinpoha
pulled
them
out
by
the
tails
she
put
them
in
the
cage
with
the
owl
and
he
pecked
at
them
hungrily
what
will
your
aunt
say
when
she
sees
him
asked
gladys
i
do
know
said
hinpoha
doubtfully
aunt
phoebe
was
away
for
the
afternoon
and
so
had
not
been
in
a
position
to
interfere
thus
far
maybe
i
had
better
take
the
cage
home
with
me
suggested
gladys
no
said
hinpoha
firmly
i
want
him
myself
i
tell
you
what
do
i
put
the
cage
up
in
the
attic
and
she
never
know
i
have
him
i
can
slip
up
and
feed
him
it
would
be
better
for
him
up
there
anyway
it
too
warm
for
him
downstairs
he
used
to
a
cold
climate
so
snowy
as
they
had
christened
him
was
established
by
a
window
under
the
eaves
on
the
third
floor
where
he
could
look
out
at
the
trees
for
which
he
would
be
pining
aunt
phoebe
always
took
a
nap
after
lunch
and
this
gave
hinpoha
a
chance
to
run
up
and
look
at
her
patient
she
fed
him
on
chicken
feed
and
mice
when
there
were
any
never
did
he
show
the
slightest
sign
of
friendliness
or
recognition
when
she
hovered
over
him
but
continued
to
stare
sorrowfully
at
her
with
an
unblinking
eye
if
he
liked
his
new
lodging
under
the
cozy
eaves
he
made
no
mention
of
it
and
if
he
pined
for
his
winter
palace
in
the
canadian
forest
he
was
equally
uncommunicative
hinpoha
longed
to
poke
him
in
order
to
make
him
give
some
expression
of
feeling
but
at
all
events
he
did
not
struggle
against
his
captivity
and
hinpoha
reflected
judicially
that
after
all
it
was
a
good
thing
that
he
had
such
a
stolid
personality
for
a
calm
frame
of
mind
aids
the
recovery
of
the
patient
and
he
would
not
be
likely
to
keep
his
wing
from
healing
by
dashing
it
against
the
side
of
the
cage
it
seemed
almost
as
though
he
knew
his
presence
in
the
house
was
a
secret
and
was
in
league
with
hinpoha
not
to
betray
himself
so
aunt
phoebe
lived
downstairs
in
blissful
ignorance
of
the
feathered
boarder
in
the
attic
she
was
suffering
from
a
cold
that
week
and
was
more
than
usually
exacting
she
finally
took
to
her
bed
in
an
room
with
a
mustard
plaster
and
an
electric
heating
pad
expressing
her
intention
of
staying
there
until
her
cold
was
cured
but
you
ought
to
have
some
fresh
air
protested
hinpoha
you
smother
in
there
with
all
that
heat
you
leave
that
window
shut
said
aunt
phoebe
crossly
all
this
foolishness
about
open
windows
makes
me
tired
it
a
pity
if
a
young
girl
has
to
tell
her
elders
what
best
for
them
now
bring
the
history
of
the
presbyterian
church
and
read
that
seventh
chapter
over
again
my
mind
was
preoccupied
last
night
and
i
did
not
hear
it
distinctly
this
was
aunt
phoebe
excuse
for
having
fallen
asleep
during
the
reading
so
poor
hinpoha
had
to
sit
in
that
stifling
room
and
read
until
she
thought
she
would
faint
aunt
phoebe
fell
asleep
presently
however
to
her
great
relief
and
she
stole
out
softly
leaving
the
door
open
behind
her
so
that
some
air
could
get
in
from
the
hall
aunt
phoebe
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
feeling
decidedly
uncomfortable
she
was
nearly
baked
with
the
heat
that
was
being
applied
on
all
sides
she
turned
off
the
heating
pad
and
threw
back
one
of
the
covers
and
as
she
grew
more
comfortable
sleep
began
to
hover
near
she
was
just
sinking
off
into
a
doze
when
she
suddenly
started
up
in
terror
there
was
a
presence
in
the
room
something
white
was
moving
silently
toward
the
bed
aunt
phoebe
was
terribly
superstitious
and
believed
in
ghosts
as
firmly
as
she
believed
in
the
gospel
she
always
expected
to
see
a
sheeted
figure
standing
in
the
hall
some
night
its
hand
outstretched
in
solemn
warning
but
this
ghost
was
more
terrifying
than
any
she
had
ever
imagined
it
was
not
in
the
form
of
a
being
at
all
just
a
formless
thing
that
moved
with
strange
jerks
and
starts
sometimes
rising
at
least
a
foot
in
the
air
the
hair
stood
up
straight
on
aunt
phoebe
head
and
her
lips
became
so
dry
they
cracked
then
her
heart
almost
stopped
beating
altogether
the
ghost
rose
in
the
air
and
stood
on
her
bed
where
it
continued
its
uncanny
movements
aunt
phoebe
folded
her
hands
and
began
to
pray
the
ghost
sailed
upward
once
more
and
stood
on
the
foot
board
of
her
bed
aunt
phoebe
prayed
harder
hoot
said
the
ghost
aunt
phoebe
moaned
hoot
said
the
ghost
aunt
phoebe
tried
to
scream
but
her
throat
was
paralyzed
hoot
said
the
ghost
aunt
phoebe
found
her
voice
she
screeched
in
tones
that
could
have
been
heard
a
block
hinpoha
jumped
clear
out
of
bed
in
one
leap
and
reached
aunt
room
in
one
more
visions
of
burglars
and
fire
were
in
her
mind
hastily
she
turned
on
the
light
aunt
phoebe
was
sitting
up
in
bed
still
screaming
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
and
on
the
footboard
of
the
bed
sat
snowy
blinking
in
the
sudden
light
hinpoha
stood
frozen
to
the
spot
how
had
the
bird
gotten
out
snowy
she
stammered
the
owl
looked
at
her
with
his
old
solemn
stare
and
then
slowly
he
winked
one
eye
stop
screaming
aunt
phoebe
said
hinpoha
it
nothing
but
an
owl
exclaimed
aunt
phoebe
faintly
how
could
an
owl
get
in
here
with
all
the
doors
and
windows
shut
but
i
left
your
door
open
when
i
went
out
said
hinpoha
and
snowy
must
have
gotten
out
of
his
cage
and
come
down
the
attic
stairs
must
have
gotten
out
of
his
cage
echoed
aunt
phoebe
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
have
an
owl
in
a
cage
somewhere
in
this
house
there
was
no
use
denying
the
fact
any
more
as
snowy
had
given
himself
away
so
completely
and
hinpoha
told
about
finding
the
snowy
owl
in
the
yard
and
putting
it
up
in
the
cage
what
next
gasped
aunt
phoebe
i
suppose
i
shall
wake
up
some
morning
and
find
a
boa
constrictor
in
my
bed
i
sorry
he
frightened
you
so
said
hinpoha
contritely
but
i
see
that
he
does
get
out
again
i
may
keep
him
until
his
wing
heals
may
i
she
asked
pleadingly
i
suppose
there
no
getting
around
you
sighed
aunt
phoebe
sinking
back
on
her
pillow
if
it
was
a
bird
you
be
having
something
else
only
keep
him
out
of
my
sight
hinpoha
caught
the
owl
and
carried
him
out
with
many
flutters
and
pecks
the
cage
door
stood
open
and
the
wires
were
bent
out
showing
where
his
powerful
bill
had
pecked
until
he
gained
his
freedom
hinpoha
fastened
him
in
again
and
he
stepped
decorously
up
on
his
perch
and
sat
there
in
such
a
dignified
attitude
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
him
capable
of
breaking
jail
and
entering
a
lady
bedroom
aunt
phoebe
spent
the
next
day
in
bed
recovering
from
her
fright
this
was
the
night
of
the
camp
fire
meeting
which
hinpoha
had
been
given
permission
to
attend
she
had
been
in
such
a
fever
of
anticipation
all
week
that
aunt
phoebe
was
surprised
when
she
came
into
her
room
after
supper
and
sat
down
with
the
history
of
the
presbyterian
church
well
are
you
going
to
that
precious
meeting
of
yours
she
asked
sharply
i
think
said
hinpoha
slowly
that
i
had
better
stay
at
home
with
you
i
wo
die
without
you
said
aunt
phoebe
drily
i
can
ring
for
mary
if
i
want
anything
a
mighty
struggle
was
going
on
inside
of
hinpoha
first
she
saw
in
her
mind
eye
her
beloved
winnebagos
having
a
meeting
at
nyoda
house
the
place
where
she
best
loved
to
go
to
meetings
waiting
to
welcome
her
back
into
their
midst
with
open
arms
and
then
she
saw
this
cross
old
woman
her
aunt
sick
and
lonesome
left
alone
in
the
house
with
a
maid
who
despised
her
with
the
cup
of
enjoyment
raised
to
her
lips
she
set
it
down
again
i
think
i
would
stay
with
you
aunt
phoebe
she
said
simply
and
in
the
desert
of
waiting
there
blossomed
a
fragrant
rose
the
deferred
celebration
for
hinpoha
return
into
the
winnebago
fold
was
held
the
following
week
with
the
joy
of
the
returned
pilgrim
she
took
her
place
in
the
council
circle
and
once
more
joined
in
singing
burn
fire
burn
and
mystic
fire
and
this
time
when
nyoda
called
the
roll
and
pronounced
the
name
hinpoha
she
was
answered
by
a
joyous
kolah
instead
of
the
sorrowful
silence
which
had
followed
that
name
for
so
many
weeks
february
froze
thawed
snowed
and
sleeted
itself
off
the
calendar
and
march
set
in
like
a
roaring
lion
with
a
worse
snowstorm
than
even
the
snow
moon
had
produced
venturesome
treebuds
who
loved
the
warm
sun
like
aunt
phoebe
loved
her
heating
pad
and
who
had
crept
out
of
their
dark
blankets
one
balmy
day
in
february
to
be
nearer
the
genial
heat
giver
shivered
until
their
sap
froze
in
their
veins
and
a
phoebe
bird
who
had
nested
under
the
eaves
of
the
bradford
porch
the
year
before
coming
back
to
his
summer
residence
according
to
the
date
marked
on
his
calendar
huddled
disconsolately
beside
the
old
nest
feeling
sure
that
he
would
contract
bronchitis
before
the
wife
of
his
bosom
arrived
to
join
him
hinpoha
listened
to
his
disgruntled
pewit
phoebe
pewit
phoebe
and
made
haste
to
throw
him
some
crumbs
it
seemed
like
a
delicious
joke
to
her
that
he
should
be
calling
so
plaintively
for
his
phoebe
not
knowing
that
there
was
a
phoebe
on
the
premises
all
the
while
and
one
day
the
little
mate
came
and
both
birds
forgot
the
snow
and
cold
in
the
joy
of
their
reunion
phoebes
consider
it
extremely
indecorous
to
travel
in
mixed
company
just
like
aunt
phoebe
thought
hinpoha
humorously
so
the
females
linger
behind
for
several
days
after
the
males
start
north
and
join
them
in
the
seclusion
of
their
own
homes
hinpoha
heart
sang
in
sympathy
with
the
joy
of
the
reunited
lovers
sahwah
had
come
over
to
get
her
lessons
with
hinpoha
and
as
she
turned
the
leaves
of
her
cicero
a
little
red
heart
dropped
out
on
the
floor
hinpoha
stooped
to
pick
it
up
what
this
she
asked
with
interest
sahwah
blushed
ned
roberts
you
remember
ned
roberts
up
at
camp
sent
it
to
me
for
a
valentine
hinpoha
went
back
in
her
thoughts
to
the
dance
at
the
mountain
lake
camp
the
summer
before
where
she
had
had
such
a
royal
good
time
how
far
removed
that
time
seemed
now
i
wonder
if
sherry
ever
writes
to
nyoda
she
said
musingly
i
do
believe
he
does
said
sahwah
for
nyoda
has
never
said
anything
if
they
could
have
seen
nyoda
at
that
very
moment
reading
a
certain
letter
and
thrusting
it
into
her
bureau
drawer
with
a
pile
of
others
bearing
the
same
they
would
really
have
had
something
to
gossip
about
did
you
ever
see
such
a
snowfall
in
march
said
hinpoha
looking
out
the
window
at
the
white
landscape
it
must
be
perfectly
grand
coasting
said
sahwah
ever
with
an
eye
for
sport
dick
albright
promised
he
would
take
us
out
on
his
new
bob
the
next
time
there
was
snow
and
this
is
the
next
time
and
will
probably
be
the
last
time
do
you
suppose
you
could
come
along
i
doubt
it
said
hinpoha
aunt
phoebe
thinks
coasting
is
too
rough
did
i
ever
tell
you
the
time
mother
and
i
coasted
down
the
walk
and
ran
into
aunt
phoebe
sahwah
laughed
heartily
over
the
story
poor
aunt
phoebe
she
said
wiping
the
tears
of
laughter
from
her
eyes
she
is
bound
to
get
all
the
shocks
that
flesh
is
heir
to
as
she
was
walking
home
through
the
snow
that
afternoon
some
one
came
up
behind
her
and
took
her
books
from
her
hand
it
was
dick
albright
good
afternoon
miss
brewster
he
said
formally
good
afternoon
albright
said
sahwah
in
the
same
tone
her
eyes
dancing
in
her
head
then
she
burst
out
oh
dick
wo
you
take
us
coasting
night
this
is
positively
the
last
snow
of
the
season
sure
said
dick
take
you
if
you
want
to
sahwah
shook
her
head
nothing
doing
to
quote
your
own
elegant
phrase
she
said
i
a
german
test
on
morning
and
consequently
have
an
engagement
with
my
friend
wilhelm
tell
i
simply
got
to
get
above
in
this
test
or
go
below
passing
for
the
month
i
got
through
last
month
without
ever
looking
at
it
but
it
wo
work
again
this
month
how
did
you
do
it
asked
dick
why
answered
sahwah
when
it
came
to
the
test
and
we
were
asked
to
tell
the
story
of
the
book
i
simply
wrote
down
ca
tell
you
that
one
but
i
can
tell
another
just
as
good
and
i
did
old
frühlingslied
was
so
floored
by
my
cheek
that
he
passed
me
but
he
has
had
a
watchful
eye
on
me
ever
since
dick
laughed
outright
i
never
saw
anything
like
you
he
said
swinging
her
books
around
in
his
hand
the
red
heart
fell
out
into
the
snow
dick
picked
it
up
who
your
friend
he
said
deliberately
reading
the
name
and
immediately
filled
with
jealous
pangs
dick
liked
sahwah
better
than
any
girl
in
school
her
irrepressible
fun
loving
nature
held
him
fascinated
sahwah
liked
dick
too
but
no
better
than
she
liked
most
of
the
boys
in
the
class
sahwah
was
a
poor
hand
to
regard
a
boy
as
a
beau
boys
were
good
things
to
skate
with
or
play
ball
or
go
rowing
with
they
came
in
handy
when
there
were
heavy
things
to
lift
and
all
that
but
in
none
of
these
things
did
one
seem
to
have
any
advantage
over
the
others
so
it
was
immaterial
to
her
which
one
she
had
a
good
time
with
the
good
time
was
the
main
thing
to
her
sahwah
had
a
fifteen
year
old
brother
and
she
knew
what
a
boy
was
under
his
white
collar
and
boiled
shirt
there
was
no
silly
sentimentality
in
her
spicy
she
was
a
royal
good
companion
when
there
was
any
fun
going
on
but
it
was
about
as
easy
to
get
soft
with
her
as
with
a
stone
fence
post
she
was
a
master
hand
at
ridicule
and
the
boys
knew
this
and
respected
her
accordingly
in
spite
of
all
this
admiration
of
her
remained
steadfast
and
he
would
have
attempted
to
jump
over
the
moon
if
she
had
dared
him
to
do
it
hence
the
valentine
signed
ned
roberts
piqued
him
sahwah
had
ordered
him
not
to
send
her
one
and
he
had
meekly
obeyed
it
hurt
him
to
think
any
one
else
had
the
right
to
do
it
who
your
friend
he
repeated
as
he
handed
her
the
heart
oh
somebody
said
sahwah
enjoying
the
opportunity
of
teasing
him
and
that
was
all
he
could
get
out
of
her
in
spite
of
numerous
questions
you
surely
go
coasting
night
he
said
as
he
left
her
in
front
of
her
house
i
surely
will
said
sahwah
flashing
him
a
brilliant
smile
i
would
miss
it
for
the
world
if
ever
a
girl
had
the
power
to
allure
and
torment
a
boy
that
girl
was
sahwah
the
house
belonging
to
the
gardiners
was
now
rented
together
with
the
furnished
room
and
brought
in
thirty
dollars
a
month
which
made
housekeeping
much
smoother
sailing
for
migwan
but
the
fact
still
remained
that
the
money
which
was
to
have
put
her
into
college
the
next
year
was
spent
and
there
was
no
present
prospect
of
replacing
it
her
mother
was
now
home
from
the
hospital
and
fully
on
the
road
to
recovery
and
migwan
tried
to
make
her
happiness
over
this
fact
overbalance
her
disappointment
at
her
own
loss
none
of
her
stories
or
picture
plays
had
been
accepted
and
of
late
she
had
had
to
give
up
writing
for
with
her
mother
sick
most
of
the
housework
fell
on
her
shoulders
although
she
maintained
a
bright
and
cheery
exterior
she
went
about
mourning
in
secret
for
her
lost
career
as
she
called
it
and
the
heart
went
out
of
her
studying
she
was
walking
soberly
through
the
hall
at
school
one
morning
when
she
heard
somebody
call
out
oh
miss
gardiner
come
here
a
minute
it
was
professor
green
standing
in
the
door
of
his
class
room
there
is
something
i
want
to
tell
you
about
he
said
smiling
down
at
her
when
she
came
up
to
him
you
like
to
study
history
pretty
well
do
you
migwan
nodded
next
to
latin
history
was
her
favorite
study
well
resumed
professor
green
here
is
a
chance
for
you
to
do
something
with
it
you
remember
that
professor
parsons
who
lectured
to
the
school
on
various
historical
subjects
last
winter
you
know
he
is
a
perfect
crank
on
having
boys
and
girls
learn
history
he
has
now
offered
a
prize
of
to
the
boy
or
girl
in
the
graduating
class
of
this
high
school
who
can
pass
the
best
examination
in
ancient
medieval
and
modern
history
you
have
had
all
three
of
those
subjects
have
you
not
yes
said
migwan
eagerly
the
examination
is
to
take
place
the
last
week
in
april
continued
professor
green
word
to
the
wise
is
sufficient
you
are
one
of
the
best
students
of
history
in
the
class
migwan
went
away
after
thanking
him
for
telling
her
about
it
feeling
as
if
she
were
treading
on
air
there
was
no
doubt
in
her
mind
about
her
ability
to
learn
history
as
there
was
about
geometry
she
had
an
amazing
memory
for
dates
and
events
and
in
her
imaginative
mind
the
happenings
of
centuries
ago
took
form
and
color
and
stood
out
as
vividly
as
if
she
saw
them
passing
by
in
review
her
heart
beat
violently
when
she
thought
that
she
had
as
good
a
chance
if
not
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
class
of
winning
that
prize
this
would
pay
her
tuition
in
the
local
university
for
the
first
year
she
resolved
to
throw
her
fruitless
writing
to
the
winds
and
put
all
her
strength
into
her
history
the
world
stretched
out
before
her
a
blooming
sunny
meadow
instead
of
a
stagnant
fen
and
exultantly
she
sang
to
herself
one
of
the
pageant
songs
of
the
camp
fire
girls
darkness
behind
us
peace
around
us
joy
before
us
white
flame
forever
that
morning
the
announcement
of
the
prize
examination
was
made
to
the
whole
class
and
abraham
goldstein
also
resolved
that
he
would
win
that
the
snow
lasted
over
another
day
and
the
next
night
sahwah
and
dick
albright
and
a
half
dozen
other
girls
and
boys
went
coasting
it
was
bright
moonlight
and
the
air
was
clear
and
crisp
just
cold
enough
to
keep
the
snow
hard
and
not
cold
enough
to
chill
them
as
they
sat
on
the
bob
the
place
where
they
went
coasting
was
down
the
long
lake
drive
in
the
park
an
unbroken
stretch
of
over
half
a
mile
halfway
down
the
slope
the
land
rose
up
in
a
thank
you
marm
and
when
the
bob
struck
this
it
shot
into
the
air
and
came
down
again
in
the
path
with
a
thrilling
leap
which
never
failed
to
make
the
girls
shriek
migwan
was
there
in
the
crowd
and
gladys
and
one
or
two
more
of
the
winnebagos
dick
albright
was
in
his
element
as
he
steered
the
bob
down
the
long
white
lane
for
sahwah
sat
right
behind
him
shouting
merry
nonsense
into
his
ear
now
let
me
steer
she
commanded
when
they
had
gone
down
a
couple
of
times
do
you
do
it
dick
said
one
of
the
other
boys
she
never
steer
us
around
the
bend
dick
hesitated
there
was
a
sharp
turn
in
the
road
right
near
the
bottom
of
the
descent
and
as
the
bob
had
acquired
a
high
degree
of
speed
by
the
time
it
reached
this
point
it
required
quick
work
to
make
the
turn
if
you
do
let
me
steer
just
once
i
never
speak
to
you
again
dick
albright
said
sahwah
with
flashing
eyes
dick
wavered
the
chances
were
that
sahwah
would
land
them
safely
at
the
bottom
and
he
thought
it
worth
the
risk
of
a
possible
spill
to
stay
in
her
good
graces
all
right
go
ahead
he
said
i
believe
you
can
do
it
all
right
be
careful
when
you
come
to
the
turn
that
all
sahwah
slid
in
behind
the
steering
wheel
and
they
started
off
the
sled
traveled
faster
than
it
did
before
but
sahwah
negotiated
both
the
thank
you
marm
and
the
turn
with
as
much
skill
as
dick
himself
could
have
done
it
and
danced
a
triumphant
war
dance
when
she
had
brought
the
bob
safely
to
a
stop
there
now
smarty
she
said
to
the
boy
who
had
mistrusted
her
powers
you
see
that
a
girl
can
do
it
as
well
as
a
boy
certainly
can
said
dick
no
less
pleased
than
she
herself
at
her
success
and
you
may
steer
the
bob
the
rest
of
the
evening
if
you
want
to
sahwah
engineered
two
or
three
more
trips
and
then
the
excitement
lost
its
tang
for
her
as
the
element
of
danger
was
removed
for
the
turn
had
no
difficulties
for
her
let
coast
down
the
side
of
the
hill
once
she
suggested
no
thanks
said
migwan
eyeing
the
steep
slope
that
rose
beside
the
drive
oh
come
on
pleaded
sahwah
it
more
fun
to
go
down
a
steep
hill
you
go
so
much
faster
it
lands
you
in
a
snowbank
at
the
bottom
but
it
perfectly
safe
none
of
the
boys
and
girls
appeared
anxious
to
go
sahwah
jumped
up
and
down
with
impatience
oh
you
slowpokes
she
exclaimed
rather
crossly
then
she
turned
to
dick
albright
dick
she
said
will
you
come
with
me
even
if
the
others
wo
dick
shook
his
head
it
dangerous
he
answered
you
afraid
said
sahwah
tauntingly
i
not
said
dick
hotly
you
are
too
said
sahwah
all
right
if
you
afraid
but
i
know
some
one
who
would
be
now
sahwah
had
no
one
definite
in
mind
when
she
said
this
last
it
was
simply
an
effort
to
make
dick
feel
small
but
dick
immediately
took
it
as
a
reference
to
the
unknown
ned
roberts
who
had
sent
her
the
valentine
and
his
jealousy
got
the
better
of
his
discretion
all
right
he
said
firmly
determined
to
measure
up
to
this
pattern
of
dauntlessness
come
on
if
you
want
to
i
go
with
you
the
two
climbed
up
the
steep
hill
dragging
the
bob
after
them
when
sahwah
was
sitting
behind
the
steering
wheel
poised
at
the
top
and
ready
to
make
the
swift
descent
she
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
the
sharp
incline
it
looked
so
much
worse
from
the
top
than
from
the
bottom
she
would
have
drawn
back
and
given
it
up
but
sahwah
had
a
stubborn
pride
that
shrank
from
saying
she
was
afraid
to
do
anything
she
had
undertaken
shove
off
she
commanded
gritting
her
chattering
teeth
together
the
bob
shot
downward
like
a
cannon
ball
in
spite
of
her
terror
sahwah
enjoyed
the
sensation
she
held
firmly
on
to
the
steering
wheel
and
made
for
the
great
bank
of
snow
which
had
been
thrown
up
by
the
men
cleaning
the
foot
walks
at
that
moment
an
automobile
turned
into
the
lake
drive
and
its
blinding
lights
shone
full
into
sahwah
eyes
dazzled
she
turned
her
head
away
at
the
same
time
jerking
the
steering
wheel
to
the
right
the
bob
swerved
sharply
to
one
side
and
crashed
into
a
tree
the
force
of
the
impact
threw
dick
clear
of
the
sled
and
he
rolled
head
over
heels
down
the
hill
landing
in
the
snow
at
the
bottom
badly
shaken
but
otherwise
unhurt
sahwah
lay
motionless
in
the
snow
beside
the
wreck
of
the
bob
chapter
xii
hoffman
the
girls
and
boys
crowded
around
her
with
frightened
faces
is
she
killed
they
asked
each
other
in
terrified
tones
it
all
my
fault
said
dick
albright
nearly
beside
himself
i
should
have
known
better
than
to
let
her
go
she
did
think
of
the
danger
but
i
did
and
i
should
have
prevented
her
was
there
ever
such
a
fool
as
i
gladys
and
migwan
were
kneeling
beside
sahwah
and
opening
her
coat
she
is
not
dead
said
gladys
feeling
her
pulse
we
must
get
her
home
she
is
possibly
only
stunned
sahwah
moved
slightly
and
groaned
but
she
did
not
open
her
eyes
a
passing
automobile
was
hailed
and
she
was
carried
to
it
as
carefully
as
possible
and
taken
home
a
slight
concussion
of
the
brain
said
the
hastily
summoned
doctor
after
he
had
made
his
examination
and
a
fractured
hip
the
hip
can
be
fixed
all
right
but
the
concussion
may
be
worse
than
it
looks
that
is
an
ugly
contusion
on
her
head
the
next
few
days
were
anxious
ones
in
the
brewster
home
sahwah
gave
no
sign
of
returning
consciousness
and
her
fever
rose
steadily
brewster
felt
her
hair
turning
gray
with
the
suspense
and
the
winnebagos
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
poor
dick
was
frantic
yet
he
dared
not
show
himself
at
the
house
for
fear
every
one
would
point
an
accusing
finger
at
him
as
the
one
responsible
for
the
misfortune
but
sahwah
true
to
her
usual
habit
of
always
doing
the
unexpected
thing
progressed
along
just
the
opposite
lines
from
those
prophesied
by
the
physician
after
a
few
days
her
fever
abated
and
the
danger
from
the
concussion
was
over
sahwah
head
had
demonstrated
itself
to
be
of
a
superior
solidness
of
construction
but
the
hip
which
at
first
had
not
given
them
a
moment
uneasiness
steadfastly
refused
to
mend
benson
looked
puzzled
then
grave
the
splintered
end
of
that
hip
bone
began
to
be
a
nightmare
to
him
he
called
in
another
doctor
for
consultation
the
new
doctor
set
it
in
a
different
way
nearly
killing
sahwah
with
the
pain
although
she
struggled
valiantly
to
be
brave
and
bear
it
in
silence
nyoda
never
forgot
that
tortured
smile
with
which
sahwah
greeted
her
when
she
came
in
after
the
process
was
over
a
week
or
two
passed
and
the
bones
still
made
no
effort
to
knit
another
consulting
physician
was
called
in
a
prominent
surgeon
he
ordered
sahwah
removed
to
the
hospital
where
he
made
half
a
dozen
pictures
of
her
hip
the
joint
was
so
badly
inflamed
and
swollen
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
just
where
the
trouble
lay
sahwah
fumed
and
fretted
with
impatience
at
having
to
stay
in
bed
so
long
surgeon
after
surgeon
examined
the
fracture
and
shook
their
heads
at
last
a
long
consultation
was
held
at
the
close
of
which
and
brewster
were
called
into
the
council
of
physicians
we
have
discovered
said
lord
a
man
high
up
in
the
profession
who
was
considered
the
final
authority
that
the
ball
joint
of
your
hip
has
been
fractured
in
such
a
way
that
it
can
never
heal
there
is
one
inevitable
result
of
this
condition
and
that
is
tuberculosis
of
the
bone
if
not
arrested
this
will
in
time
communicate
itself
to
the
bones
of
the
upper
part
of
the
body
and
terminate
fatally
there
is
only
one
way
to
prevent
this
outcome
and
that
is
amputation
of
the
limb
before
the
disease
gets
a
hold
on
the
system
you
mean
cut
her
leg
off
asked
brewster
faintly
yes
said
lord
shortly
he
was
a
man
of
few
words
sahwah
was
stunned
when
she
heard
the
verdict
of
the
surgeons
she
knew
little
about
disease
and
it
seemed
wildly
impossible
to
her
that
this
limb
of
hers
which
had
been
so
strong
and
supple
a
month
ago
would
become
an
agent
of
death
if
not
amputated
she
was
in
an
agony
of
mind
never
to
swim
again
never
to
run
and
jump
and
slide
and
skate
and
dance
always
to
go
about
on
crutches
before
the
prospect
of
being
crippled
for
life
her
active
nature
shrank
in
unutterable
horror
death
seemed
preferable
to
her
she
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
in
such
anguish
that
the
watchers
by
the
bedside
could
not
stand
by
and
see
it
after
a
day
of
acute
mental
suffering
her
courage
began
to
rear
its
head
and
she
made
up
her
mind
that
if
this
terrible
thing
had
to
be
done
she
might
as
well
go
through
with
it
as
bravely
as
possible
she
resigned
herself
to
her
fate
and
urged
her
parents
to
give
their
consent
to
the
operation
poor
brewster
was
nearly
out
of
her
mind
with
worry
over
the
affair
when
will
you
do
it
asked
sahwah
struggling
to
keep
her
voice
steady
in
about
a
week
said
lord
when
you
get
a
little
stronger
nyoda
went
home
heartsick
from
the
hospital
that
day
sahwah
had
asked
her
to
write
to
hoffman
her
old
friend
in
camp
and
tell
him
the
news
with
a
shaking
hand
she
wrote
the
letter
poor
old
hoffman
she
said
to
herself
how
badly
he
will
feel
when
he
hears
that
sahwah
is
hurt
and
he
can
do
nothing
to
help
her
sahwah
had
never
dreamed
how
many
friends
she
had
until
this
misfortune
overcame
her
boys
and
girls
as
well
as
old
people
and
little
children
horrified
at
the
calamity
came
by
the
dozen
to
offer
cheer
and
comfort
her
room
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
flowers
even
old
fuzzytop
whom
sahwah
had
tormented
nearly
to
death
came
to
offer
his
sympathy
and
present
a
potted
tulip
stiff
and
precise
miss
muggins
came
to
say
how
she
missed
her
from
the
latin
class
aunt
phoebe
forgave
all
the
jokes
she
had
made
at
her
expense
and
sent
over
a
crocheted
dressing
jacket
made
of
fleecy
wool
do
feel
so
badly
nyoda
dear
she
said
one
day
as
nyoda
sat
beside
her
in
the
depths
of
despair
the
usual
jolly
teacher
had
now
no
cheery
word
to
offer
the
prospect
of
the
gay
dancing
sahwah
on
crutches
for
the
remainder
of
her
life
was
an
appalling
tragedy
i
can
act
out
little
tin
soldier
quite
realistically
then
went
on
sahwah
her
mind
already
at
work
to
find
the
humor
of
the
situation
but
nyoda
sat
staring
miserably
at
the
flowers
on
the
dresser
telegram
for
miss
brewster
said
the
nurse
appearing
in
the
doorway
a
telegram
for
me
asked
sahwah
curiously
stretching
out
her
hand
for
the
envelope
she
tore
it
open
eagerly
and
read
do
operate
until
i
come
dr
hoffman
he
coming
cried
sahwah
hoffman
is
coming
he
said
if
i
ever
broke
a
bone
again
he
would
come
and
set
it
poor
doctor
how
disappointed
he
be
when
he
finds
he
ca
it
hoffman
arrived
the
next
day
vell
vell
missis
sahvah
he
said
anxiously
as
he
saw
her
lying
so
ominously
still
on
the
bed
you
haf
not
been
trying
to
push
somevon
across
de
top
of
lake
erie
haf
you
sahwah
smiled
faintly
a
ray
of
sunlight
seemed
to
have
entered
the
room
with
the
doctor
also
a
gust
of
wind
he
had
thrown
his
hat
right
into
a
bouquet
of
flowers
and
his
hair
stood
on
end
and
his
tie
was
askew
with
the
haste
he
had
made
in
getting
to
the
hospital
from
the
train
now
about
this
hip
yes
he
said
in
a
businesslike
tone
without
any
ceremony
he
brushed
the
nurse
aside
and
unwrapped
the
bandages
ach
so
he
said
feeling
of
the
joint
with
a
practised
hand
you
did
a
good
job
missis
sahvah
you
make
out
of
your
bone

doctors

a
vonder
dey

to

his
voice
rose
to
a
regular
roar
lord
coming
in
at
that
moment
stopped
in
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
this
strange
doctor
standing
over
his
patient
for
vy
did
you
want
to
amputate
her
leg
off
shouted
hoffman
at
him
dancing
up
and
down
in
front
of
him
and
shaking
his
finger
under
his
nose
it
is
no
more
diseased
dan

lord
looking
at
him
as
though
he
thought

were
an
escaped
lunatic
dis

hoffman
handing

a

i
like
to
see
you
do
it
said
lord
patience
my
friend
said
hoffman
first
ve
make
a
little
plaster
cast
when
brewster
came
in
the
afternoon
she
found
a
strange
doctor
in
command
and
lord
and
the
nurses
obeying
his
orders
as
if
hypnotized
when
she
went
home
that
night
hope
had
come
to
life
again
in
her
heart
where
it
had
been
dead
for
more
than
a
week
hoffman
spent
the
afternoon
having
photographs
of
the
joint
made
and
sat
up
all
night
trying
to
figure
out
how
those
bones
could
be
set
so
they
would
knit
and
still
not
leave
the
joint
stiff
by
morning
he
had
the
solution
the
next
day
the
day
the
limb
was
to
have
been
amputated
an
operation
of
a
very
different
nature
took
place
hoffman
looking
more
like
a
pastry
cook
in
his
operating
clothes
than
anything
else
bustled
around
the
operating
room
keeping
the
nurses
and
assisting
physicians
on
the
jump
who
the
dutchman
that
doing
the
bossing
asked
a
pert
young
interne
of
one
of
the
doctors
shut
up
answered
the
doctor
addressed
that
hoffman
of
the
in
berlin
and
the
royal
college
of
vienna
he
was
professor
of
anatomy
in
the
do
you
remember
he
said
turning
to
one
of
the
other
doctors
he
a
wizard
at
bonesetting
he
performed
that
operation
on
count
youngest
son
that
kept
him
from
being
a
cripple
the
younger
doctor
looked
at
hoffman
with
a
sudden
respect
the
case
in
question
was
a
famous
one
in
surgical
annals
lord
angry
as
he
was
at
hoffman
arraignment
of
him
before
the
nurses
and
visitors
was
yet
a
big
enough
man
to
realize
that
he
had
a
chance
to
learn
something
from
this
sarcastic
intruder
who
had
so
unceremoniously
taken
his
case
out
of
his
hands
and
swallowing
his
wrath
asked
permission
to
witness
the
operation
ach
yes
to
be
sure
said
hoffman
with
his
old
geniality
you
must
not
mind
that
i
vas
so
cross
yesterday
he
went
on
it
vas
because
i
vas
so
impatient
ven
i
hear
you
vanted
to
amputate
dot
girl
leg
off
but
i
forget
he
said
magnanimously
you
do
not
know
how
to
set
de
badly
splintered
bones
so
dey
vill
knit
as
i
do
bring
all
de
doctors
in
you
vant
to
and
all
de
nurses
too
ve
vill
haf
a
thus
it
was
that
the
large
operating
room
of
the
hospital
was
crowded
to
the
very
edge
of
the
sterile
field
with
eager
medical
men
glad
of
the
chance
to
watch
hoffman
at
work
who
is
that
young
girl
in
here
asked
lord
impatiently
as
the
anaesthetic
was
about
to
be
administered
some
friend
of
the
patient
explained
the
head
nurse
hoffman
let
her
in
himself
the
young
girl
in
question
was
medmangi
hoffman
knew
all
about
her
ambition
to
become
a
doctor
and
allowed
her
to
come
into
the
operating
room
so
she
began
her
career
by
witnessing
one
of
the
most
inspired
operations
of
a
widely
famed
surgeon
when
sahwah
came
out
of
the
ether
she
felt
as
if
she
were
held
in
a
vise
what
the
matter
she
asked
dreamily
i
feel
so
stiff
and
queer
it
the
cast
they
put
you
in
answered
her
mother
sahwah
moved
her
arms
carefully
to
see
if
they
were
in
working
order
yet
lightly
she
touched
the
hard
substance
that
surrounded
her
hip
bone
they
did
cut
it
off
did
they
she
asked
in
sudden
terror
she
could
not
tell
by
the
feeling
whether
she
had
two
legs
or
one
hoffman
coming
in
in
time
to
hear
the
question
snorted
violently
do
talk
such
nonsense
missis
sahvah
he
said
waving
his
hands
emphatically
dot
limb
is
still
vere
it
belongs
and
vill
be
as
good
as
ever
ven
de
cast
comes
off
the
watchers
around
the
bed
that
day
wore
very
different
expressions
from
what
they
had
worn
all
week
just
since
yesterday
despair
had
given
way
to
hope
and
hope
to
assurance
her
mother
and
father
and
nyoda
hovered
over
the
bed
with
radiant
faces
and
the
winnebagos
after
seeing
sahwah
favorable
condition
with
their
own
eyes
retired
to
gladys
barn
to
celebrate
the
rules
of
the
hospital
forbade
the
amount
of
noise
they
felt
they
must
make

his
first

migwan
in
high
spirits
resolved
the
rules
in
her
french
grammar
into
poetry
as
she
learned
them
regular
lessons
were
gotten
out
of
the
way
as
quickly
as
possible
these
days
to
give
more
time
to
the
study
of
history
and
to
migwan
studying
history
meant
not
merely
the
memorizing
of
a
number
of
facts
attached
to
dates
which
might
or
might
not
stay
in
her
mind
at
the
crucial
time
it
was
the
bringing
to
life
of
bygone
races
and
people
and
putting
herself
in
their
places
and
living
along
with
them
the
events
described
on
the
pages
taking
it
in
this
way
migwan
had
a
very
clear
and
vivid
picture
of
the
things
she
was
learning
and
her
answers
to
questions
showed
such
a
thorough
knowledge
of
her
subject
that
she
was
regarded
as
a
grind
at
history
while
the
truth
was
that
she
did
less
grinding
than
the
rest
of
the
class
who
merely
memorized
figures
and
facts
without
calling
in
the
aid
of
the
imagination
so
migwan
learned
her
new
history
and
reviewed
her
old
and
was
as
happy
as
the
day
was
long
as
the
time
approached
for
the
examination
she
felt
more
sure
of
herself
every
day
the
long
hours
of
patient
study
were
about
to
be
rewarded
and
she
would
bring
honor
to
the
winnebagos
by
winning
the
parsons
prize
that
little
point
about
bringing
honor
to
the
winnebagos
was
keenly
felt
by
migwan
ever
since
sahwah
had
covered
herself
with
undying
glory
in
the
game
with
the
carnegie
mechanics
migwan
felt
a
longing
to
distinguish
herself
in
some
way
also
sahwah
fame
was
widespread
and
when
any
of
the
winnebagos
happened
to
mention
that
they
belonged
to
that
particular
group
some
one
was
sure
to
say
the
winnebago
camp
fire
oh
yes
it
was
one
of
your
number
who
won
the
basketball
championship
for
the
school
by
making
a
record
jump
for
the
ball
was
it
the
whole
group
lived
in
the
reflected
glory
of
sahwah
the
sunfish
now
thought
migwan
resolutely
they
would
have
something
else
to
be
proud
about
in
the
future
people
would
say
the
winnebagos
oh
yes
it
was
one
of
your
girls
who
carried
off
the
parsons
prize
in
history
migwan
thrilled
with
the
joy
of
it
and
plunged
more
deeply
into
the
pages
before
her
she
was
a
different
girl
nowadays
from
the
pale
one
who
had
sat
up
night
after
night
during
the
winter
desperately
trying
to
add
something
to
the
scanty
income
by
the
labor
of
pen
and
typewriter
now
she
was
always
happy
and
sparkling
and
performed
her
household
tasks
with
such
a
will
that
her
languid
mother
lying
and
watching
her
was
likewise
filled
with
an
ambition
to
be
up
and
doing
she
was
never
cross
with
betty
these
days
no
matter
how
many
fits
of
temper
that
young
lady
indulged
in
professor
green
often
stopped
her
in
the
hall
to
ask
her
how
she
was
getting
along
in
her
preparation
and
offered
to
lend
her
reference
books
which
would
help
her
in
her
study
everybody
seemed
to
be
anxious
for
her
to
win
the
prize
and
willing
to
give
her
all
the
help
possible
migwan
did
not
make
the
mistake
of
studying
until
late
the
night
before
the
examination
she
went
to
bed
at
nine
so
as
to
be
in
fit
condition
when
she
closed
her
books
after
the
final
study
she
knew
all
that
was
to
be
learned
from
them
the
examination
was
held
in
the
senior
session
room
after
the
close
of
school
five
pupils
participated
one
was
abraham
goldstein
another
was
george
curtis
who
liked
migwan
very
well
and
hated
abraham
cordially
the
other
two
were
girls
they
all
sat
in
one
row
of
seats
migwan
first
then
george
then
abraham
and
behind
him
the
two
girls
the
lists
of
questions
were
given
out
i
hardly
need
to
say
said
the
teacher
in
attendance
that
the
honor
system
will
be
in
force
during
this
examination
migwan
made
an
effort
to
still
the
wild
beating
of
her
heart
and
read
the
questions
through
they
all
appeared
easy
to
her
as
she
had
had
such
a
thorough
preparation
george
curtis
groaned
to
himself
as
he
looked
them
over
for
there
were
two
which
he
saw
at
a
glance
he
would
be
unable
to
answer
abraham
read
his
and
looked
thoughtful
migwan
wrote
rapidly
with
a
sure
and
inspired
pen
until
she
came
to
the
last
question
there
she
halted
in
dismay
the
question
was
in
the
ancient
history
group
and
read
in
part
who
was
the
invader
of
israel
before
sennacherib
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
not
think
of
the
name
of
the
assyrian
invader
last
night
the
whole
thing
had
been
as
clear
as
crystal
in
her
mind
she
thought
until
the
perspiration
stood
out
on
her
forehead
she
tried
every
method
of
suggestion
that
she
knew
but
all
in
vain
the
name
still
eluded
her
while
she
was
trying
so
desperately
to
recall
the
name
george
curtis
in
the
seat
behind
was
watching
her
by
chance
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
paper
and
saw
the
figure
followed
by
an
empty
space
so
he
knew
that
it
was
the
tenth
question
she
was
having
trouble
with
this
happened
to
be
one
he
knew
and
he
had
just
written
it
out
in
a
bold
black
hand
he
was
out
of
the
race
for
the
prize
for
there
were
two
whole
questions
left
out
on
his
sheet
by
certain
signs
of
distress
from
the
two
girls
behind
him
he
knew
that
they
too
were
out
and
it
now
lay
between
migwan
and
abraham
abraham
was
not
very
well
liked
by
the
boys
since
the
affair
of
the
statue
george
despised
him
utterly
and
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
his
winning
that
prize
he
watched
his
chance
it
came
at
last
the
teacher
dropped
her
pencil
behind
her
desk
and
in
the
instant
when
she
was
picking
it
up
he
reached
out
and
pulled
migwan
hair
sharply
when
she
turned
around
in
surprise
he
framed
with
his
lips
the
name
sargon
she
understood
it
perfectly
then
came
a
mental
struggle
which
matched
sahwah
terrific
physical
one
that
day
in
camp
on
one
side
college
stood
with
its
doors
wide
open
to
welcome
her
she
heard
the
plaudits
of
her
friends
who
expected
and
wanted
her
to
win
the
prize
she
saw
the
joy
in
her
mother
face
when
she
heard
the
news
she
heard
the
heartfelt
congratulations
of
nyoda
and
the
winnebagos
who
would
share
in
her
glory
on
the
other
hand
she
heard
just
five
ugly
words
echoing
in
her
ears
did
win
it
honestly
she
tried
to
stifle
the
voice
of
science
i
knew
it
perfectly
all
the
time
she
said
to
herself
and
it
only
slipped
my
mind
for
an
instant
but
you
forgot
said
the
voice
and
if
he
had
told
you
you
would
have
known
miserably
she
argued
the
question
back
and
forth
it
she
did
win
the
prize
abraham
would
and
he
could
well
afford
to
go
to
college
without
the
money
he
cheat
if
he
had
the
chance
she
told
herself
that
does
help
you
any
pricked
the
accuser
you
talk
about
the
honor
of
the
winnebagos
if
you
use
that
information
you
would
be
dishonoring
the
winnebagos
you
a
cheat
you
a
cheat
it
said
tauntingly
and
a
little
sparrow
on
the
window
sill
outside
took
up
the
mocking
refrain
cheat
cheat
stung
as
though
some
one
had
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
her
migwan
flung
down
her
pen
in
despair
and
resolutely
blotted
her
paper
she
handed
in
her
examination
with
the
last
half
of
the
last
question
unanswered
and
fled
from
the
room
with
unseeing
eyes
and
in
the
instant
when
george
was
trying
to
tell
migwan
the
answer
abraham
who
had
also
forgotten
the
name
of
sargon
glanced
over
toward
paper
and
saw
it
written
out
in
his
easily
readable
hand
without
a
qualm
he
wrote
it
down
on
his
own
paper
with
a
triumphant
flourish
there
was
great
surprise
throughout
the
school
a
few
days
later
when
the
grades
of
the
examination
were
made
public
elsie
gardiner
abraham
goldstein
winner
of
the
parsons
cash
prize
of
migwan
felt
like
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
earth
after
losing
that
history
prize
she
shrank
from
meeting
the
friends
who
had
so
confidently
expected
her
to
win
it
and
her
own
thoughts
were
too
painful
to
be
left
alone
with
if
hinpoha
had
been
wandering
in
the
desert
of
waiting
for
the
past
few
months
migwan
was
sunk
deep
in
the
slough
of
despond
she
was
at
the
age
when
death
seemed
preferable
to
defeat
and
she
wished
miserably
that
she
would
fall
ill
of
some
mortal
disease
and
never
have
to
face
the
world
again
with
failure
written
on
her
forehead
oh
why
she
wailed
in
anguish
of
spirit
as
has
many
an
older
and
wiser
person
when
confronted
with
this
same
unanswerable
question
why
was
i
given
this
glimpse
of
paradise
only
to
have
the
gate
slammed
in
my
face
that
spectre
of
the
winter
before
the
belief
that
success
would
never
be
hers
gripped
her
again
with
its
icy
hand
and
was
it
any
wonder
twice
now
the
means
to
enter
college
had
been
within
her
reach
and
twice
it
had
been
swept
away
in
a
single
day
but
while
migwan
was
thus
learning
by
hard
experience
that
there
is
many
a
slip
twixt
the
cup
and
the
lip
she
was
also
to
learn
from
that
same
schoolmistress
the
truth
of
the
old
saying
three
times
and
out
in
the
meantime
however
the
skies
were
as
gray
as
the
wings
of
the
thunderbird
and
life
was
like
a
jangling
discord
struck
on
a
piano
long
out
of
tune
but
even
if
we
rather
be
dead
than
alive
as
long
as
we
alive
there
remain
certain
duties
which
have
to
be
performed
regardless
of
the
state
of
our
emotional
barometers
and
migwan
discovered
with
a
start
one
day
that
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
letters
in
her
top
bureau
drawer
waiting
to
be
answered
it
a
shame
she
said
to
herself
as
she
looked
them
over
i
have
written
to
the
bartletts
since
last
november
the
bartletts
were
the
parents
of
the
little
boy
who
was
traced
by
the
aid
of
her
timely
snapshot
she
opened
letter
and
glanced
over
it
to
put
herself
in
the
mood
for
answering
it
she
laughed
sardonically
as
she
read
bartlett
confident
that
migwan
was
going
to
use
the
reward
money
to
go
to
college
discussed
the
merits
of
different
courses
and
advised
migwan
above
all
things
with
her
talent
for
writing
to
put
the
emphasis
on
literature
and
history
migwan
took
a
certain
grim
delight
in
telling
bartlett
what
had
happened
to
her
ambition
to
go
to
college
she
had
a
homeric
sense
of
humor
that
could
see
the
point
when
the
gods
were
playing
pranks
on
helpless
mortals
she
told
the
story
simply
and
frankly
without
any
literary
style
such
as
was
usually
present
in
her
letters
to
a
high
degree
neither
did
she
bewail
her
lot
and
seek
sympathy
for
migwan
was
no
craven
then
having
told
bartlett
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
give
up
thoughts
of
college
for
several
years
at
least
as
her
duty
to
her
mother
came
before
her
ambition
and
had
sealed
and
sent
away
the
letter
it
suddenly
came
over
her
that
the
writing
she
had
done
all
winter
and
which
she
now
considered
a
waste
of
time
had
done
something
for
her
after
all
it
had
taught
her
the
use
of
the
typewriter
a
knowledge
which
she
could
turn
to
account
during
the
summertime
and
by
working
in
an
office
somewhere
she
could
possibly
earn
enough
money
to
enter
college
in
the
fall
after
all
and
up
went
migwan
spirits
again
like
a
and
went
soaring
among
the
clouds
like
the
swallows
chapter
xiv
an
automobile
and
a
driver
along
in
the
last
week
of
may
nyoda
on
a
shopping
tour
downtown
dropped
into
a
restaurant
for
a
bit
of
lunch
as
she
was
sitting
down
to
the
table
another
young
woman
came
and
sat
down
opposite
her
the
two
glanced
at
each
other
why
elizabeth
kent
exclaimed
the
latest
arrival
why
norma
williamson
exclaimed
nyoda
recognizing
an
old
college
friend
not
norma
williamson
any
more
said
the
friend
blushing
as
she
drew
off
her
glove
and
displayed
the
rings
on
her
fourth
finger
norma
bates
what
are
you
doing
to
pass
the
time
away
asked
the
pretty
little
matron
when
she
had
exhausted
her
own
experiences
of
the
last
few
years
nyoda
told
her
about
her
teaching
and
the
guardianship
of
the
winnebagos
camp
fire
girls
said
bates
how
delightful
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
best
things
that
ever
happened
to
girls
if
i
were
not
so
frightfully
busy
i
would
take
a
group
too
i
may
yet
but
i
wish
you
would
bring
your
girls
out
to
visit
us
we
living
on
the
lake
shore
for
the
summer
camp
fire
girls
would
certainly
know
how
to
have
a
good
time
at
our
place
we
have
a
launch
and
a
sailboat
and
horses
to
ride
and
a
tennis
court
ca
you
come
out
next
saturday
nyoda
thought
perhaps
they
could
i
tell
you
what
to
do
said
bates
warming
to
the
scheme
come
out
friday
after
school
and
stay
until
sunday
night
that
will
give
the
girls
more
chance
to
do
things
we
have
plenty
of
room
the
same
hospitable
norma
williamson
as
of
old
said
nyoda
smiling
at
her
do
you
remember
how
we
girls
used
to
flock
to
your
room
in
college
and
when
it
was
apparently
as
fall
as
it
could
get
you
would
always
make
room
for
one
more
i
love
to
have
people
visit
me
said
bates
simply
by
the
way
said
nyoda
as
she
rose
to
depart
how
do
you
get
to
bates
villa
take
the
interurban
car
replied
bates
and
get
off
at
stop
the
limited
leaves
the
interurban
station
at
four
that
would
be
a
good
car
to
come
on
all
right
said
nyoda
extending
her
hand
in
farewell
we
be
there
the
news
of
the
invitation
to
spend
a
in
the
country
was
received
with
a
shout
by
the
winnebagos
their
only
regret
was
that
sahwah
would
be
unable
to
go
never
mind
sahwah
comforted
nyoda
bates
wants
us
to
come
out
again
when
the
water
is
warm
enough
to
go
in
bathing
and
by
that
time
your
hip
will
be
all
right
on
friday
after
school
was
out
nyoda
and
gladys
left
the
building
together
you
are
coming
home
with
me
as
we
planned
until
it
is
time
to
take
the
car
asked
nyoda
i
afraid
i
have
to
go
home
first
after
all
said
gladys
i
came
away
in
such
a
hurry
this
morning
that
i
forgot
my
sweater
and
my
tennis
shoes
and
i
really
must
have
them
you
come
home
with
me
but
on
arriving
at
the
evans
house
they
found
nobody
home
gladys
rang
and
waited
and
rang
again
but
there
was
no
answer
gladys
frowned
with
vexation
i
simply
must
have
that
sweater
and
those
shoes
she
said
there
no
use
in
waiting
until
some
one
comes
home
it
be
too
late
mother
has
gone
for
the
day
and
father
is
out
of
town
and
if
katy
has
been
given
a
day
off
she
wo
be
at
home
until
evening
we
have
to
break
into
the
house
that
all
there
is
to
it
feeling
like
burglars
they
tried
all
the
windows
on
the
first
floor
and
the
basement
everything
was
locked
tightly
gladys
began
to
feel
desperate
do
you
suppose
i
had
better
break
the
pantry
window
she
asked
or
possibly
one
of
the
cellar
ones
i
pay
for
it
out
of
my
allowance
i
think
the
pantry
window
would
be
the
best
because
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
cellar
stairs
is
likely
to
be
locked
and
we
might
not
be
able
to
get
upstairs
if
we
did
get
into
the
cellar
nyoda
was
inspecting
the
upper
windows
of
the
house
there
is
one
open
a
little
she
said
the
one
over
the
side
entrance
gladys
abandoned
her
idea
of
breaking
the
pantry
window
and
bent
her
energies
to
reaching
the
open
one
with
the
aid
of
nyoda
she
climbed
up
the
post
of
the
little
side
porch
swung
herself
over
the
edge
of
the
roof
and
raised
the
window
stop
where
you
are
called
a
commanding
voice
gladys
and
nyoda
both
started
guiltily
a
man
was
running
across
the
lawn
from
the
next
estate
stop
or
i
call
the
police
he
said
coming
upon
the
drive
he
looked
much
disconcerted
when
nyoda
and
gladys
both
burst
into
a
ringing
peal
of
laughter
oh
it
too
funny
for
anything
said
gladys
wiping
her
eyes
to
be
caught
breaking
into
your
own
house
you
a
good
man
whoever
you
are
for
keeping
an
eye
on
the
house
she
said
to
the
arrester
but
the
joke
is
on
you
this
time
this
is
my
father
house
i
gladys
evans
give
him
one
of
my
cards
out
of
my
purse
nyoda
so
he
believe
it
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
man
convinced
that
gladys
had
a
right
to
enter
the
evans
house
by
the
window
if
she
chose
the
new
gardener
next
door
and
i
did
know
you
and
it
always
looks
suspicious
to
see
such
you
did
perfectly
right
said
gladys
as
he
went
back
to
his
work
laughing
extravagantly
over
their
being
taken
for
housebreakers
gladys
climbed
into
the
window
and
went
downstairs
opening
the
front
door
a
crack
she
gave
a
low
whistle
which
she
fondly
believed
to
be
a
signal
nyoda
answered
with
a
similar
whistle
is
that
you
diamond
dick
she
asked
in
a
thrilling
whisper
who
stands
without
asked
gladys
it
is
i
pete
hissed
nyoda
give
the
countersign
commanded
gladys
six
buckets
of
blood
replied
nyoda
in
a
curdling
voice
gladys
admitted
her
into
the
house
and
they
both
sat
down
on
the
stairs
and
shrieked
with
laughter
oh
i
can
hardly
wait
until
we
get
down
to
the
car
so
we
can
tell
the
other
girls
said
gladys
caught
in
the
act
my
fair
name
is
ruined
now
for
some
dinner
i
hungry
for
a
pickle
she
said
as
they
foraged
in
the
pantry
for
something
to
eat
wait
a
minute
until
i
go
down
cellar
and
get
some
as
she
opened
the
door
of
the
cool
cellar
she
started
back
in
surprise
on
the
floor
lay
katy
the
maid
unconscious
an
overturned
chair
beside
her
and
a
shattered
light
globe
told
how
she
had
tried
to
screw
a
new
bulb
into
the
fixture
in
the
ceiling
and
had
tipped
over
with
the
chair
striking
her
head
on
the
cement
floor
nyoda
come
down
here
called
gladys
nyoda
hastened
down
together
they
laid
the
unconscious
girl
on
a
pile
of
carpet
and
tried
to
revive
her
after
a
few
minutes
work
nyoda
went
upstairs
and
called
the
ambulance
to
take
katy
to
the
hospital
when
she
had
been
examined
by
a
surgeon
and
pronounced
badly
stunned
but
not
seriously
injured
gladys
and
nyoda
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
and
left
her
in
the
care
of
the
hospital
we
had
enough
excitement
to
last
a
month
said
gladys
as
they
hastened
tack
to
the
house
the
second
time
to
get
the
sweater
and
shoes
i
all
tired
out
so
am
i
said
nyoda
we
have
just
time
enough
to
make
that
four
car
and
none
to
spare
said
gladys
as
they
rode
toward
town
in
the
as
if
everything
were
conspiring
against
them
a
heavy
truck
loaded
with
boxes
got
caught
in
the
right
in
front
of
them
and
blocked
traffic
for
ten
minutes
gladys
and
nyoda
looked
tragically
at
each
other
at
this
delay
nyoda
held
up
her
watch
significantly
it
was
ten
minutes
to
four
just
then
gladys
spied
a
man
she
knew
in
an
automobile
slowly
passing
the
car
she
called
to
him
through
the
open
window
will
you
take
us
in
if
we
get
off
the
car
she
asked
trying
to
make
the
four
limited
certainly
agreed
the
obliging
friend
the
transfer
of
seats
was
soon
made
how
much
time
have
you
asked
the
friend
as
he
shoved
in
the
spark
ten
minutes
replied
gladys
we
make
it
said
the
friend
dodging
between
the
vehicles
that
were
standing
around
the
disabled
truck
helping
to
pull
it
from
the
getting
into
a
clear
road
he
opened
the
throttle
and
they
proceeded
like
the
wind
for
about
six
blocks
then
for
no
apparent
reason
the
car
slowed
down
and
with
a
whining
whir
of
machinery
came
to
a
dead
stop
i
afraid
i
ca
make
good
my
promise
to
catch
that
car
said
the
friend
in
a
vexed
tone
after
vainly
trying
to
start
the
car
for
several
minutes
i
have
to
be
towed
to
a
garage
nyoda
and
gladys
jumped
out
hailed
a
passing
and
reached
the
station
just
five
minutes
too
late
the
limited
had
already
pulled
out
five
girls
with
red
ties
repeated
the
crossing
policeman
when
they
made
inquiries
to
find
out
if
the
other
girls
had
gone
and
left
them
they
all
got
on
the
limited
there
was
no
doubt
about
their
having
gone
then
you
know
you
said
if
any
were
late
they
get
left
said
gladys
whoever
was
here
for
the
car
was
to
go
and
not
wait
wo
they
laugh
though
at
you
being
the
late
one
there
wo
be
another
limited
for
two
hours
said
nyoda
impatiently
and
the
local
takes
twice
as
long
to
get
there
i
telephone
bates
that
we
missed
this
car
but
will
come
out
on
the
next
limited
missed
the
car
said
bates
when
they
had
her
on
the
wire
that
too
bad
but
you
wo
have
to
wait
for
the
other
limited
our
driver
is
in
town
with
the
automobile
and
he
can
bring
you
out
he
in
morrison
now
ordering
some
supplies
and
the
car
is
at
the
corner
of
th
avenue
and
l
street
just
get
into
the
car
and
it
be
all
right
john
always
calls
me
up
before
he
starts
for
home
and
i
tell
him
about
you
it
a
blue
car
rather
bright
with
a
cane
streamer
much
cheered
by
the
thought
of
an
automobile
ride
through
the
country
instead
of
a
wait
and
the
prospect
of
being
packed
like
sardines
into
the
crowded
interurban
car
nyoda
and
gladys
moved
down
to
the
corner
of
th
avenue
and
l
street
and
found
the
car
just
as
bates
had
said
with
a
sigh
of
comfort
they
settled
down
on
the
cushions
our
struggles
are
over
said
nyoda
leaning
back
luxuriously
and
counting
over
the
various
things
that
had
happened
to
them
since
leaving
school
at
noon
in
a
few
moments
the
driver
appeared
touched
his
hat
respectfully
to
the
two
girls
in
the
tonneau
and
got
into
the
front
seat
without
any
comment
he
had
his
orders
from
bates
it
just
like
norma
williamson
to
have
a
blue
car
with
blue
cushions
said
nyoda
as
they
sped
through
the
streets
toward
the
city
limits
she
was
always
so
fond
of
blue
in
college
and
this
cane
streamer
is
just
the
finishing
touch
she
always
liked
things
trimmed
up
gaily
a
pleasant
thing
for
the
winnebagos
that
i
met
her
that
day
she
be
a
regular
fairy
godmother
to
us
talking
happily
about
the
fun
they
would
have
on
this
party
they
rode
along
the
pleasant
country
roads
bordered
with
flowering
apple
trees
and
drank
in
the
air
with
unbounded
delight
could
anything
be
lovelier
than
the
country
in
may
sighed
nyoda
would
it
be
a
joke
said
gladys
if
we
were
to
get
there
ahead
of
the
others
after
missing
the
car
would
they
stare
though
to
find
us
waiting
for
them
we
must
be
nearly
there
now
the
automobile
left
the
main
road
and
turned
down
toward
the
lake
that
must
be
the
place
continued
gladys
as
a
white
house
came
into
view
far
in
the
distance
i
do
see
any
of
the
girls
waiting
for
us
said
nyoda
i
declare
i
believe
we
here
first
oh
what
a
joke
the
estate
through
which
they
were
driving
was
a
very
large
one
much
of
it
covered
with
great
trees
the
house
was
painted
white
and
perched
directly
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
the
automobile
halted
before
the
porch
and
nyoda
and
gladys
got
out
a
woman
evidently
a
servant
came
to
the
screen
door
and
held
it
open
motioning
them
to
come
in
neither
bates
nor
any
of
the
girls
were
in
evidence
the
servant
said
nothing
i
believe
they
all
hiding
on
us
said
nyoda
getting
a
sudden
light
on
this
apparently
neglectful
reception
i
know
norma
tricks
of
old
if
we
could
only
think
of
some
way
to
turn
the
laugh
on
them
the
servant
who
had
admitted
them
led
the
way
to
an
inner
room
and
opened
a
door
stepping
aside
to
let
them
go
first
then
she
followed
and
closed
the
door
after
them
they
found
that
they
were
in
an
elevator
the
woman
pushed
a
button
and
they
began
to
rise
of
all
things
an
elevator
in
a
country
house
said
gladys
they
rose
to
a
height
which
must
have
equalled
the
third
story
of
the
house
although
they
passed
no
open
floor
they
came
to
a
halt
before
an
opening
covered
with
an
iron
grating
to
the
girls
it
looked
like
the
ordinary
elevator
entrance
at
a
touch
from
the
woman
the
grating
moved
aside
and
they
stepped
out
into
the
room
the
elevator
descended
noiselessly
and
nyoda
and
gladys
were
alone
it
a
tower
room
said
gladys
the
chamber
they
were
in
was
square
about
fifteen
by
fifteen
furnished
as
a
bedroom
through
a
door
which
opened
at
one
side
they
could
see
a
luxurious
tiled
bath
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
chamber
were
tinted
a
deep
violet
and
the
covers
on
the
bed
dresser
table
and
the
upholstery
of
the
chairs
were
of
the
same
shade
the
lamp
globes
hanging
from
the
ceiling
were
deep
purple
what
an
extraordinary
color
to
decorate
a
room
in
said
nyoda
i
wonder
if
this
is
where
we
are
going
to
sleep
where
can
bates
be
i
wonder
she
said
getting
rather
impatient
for
the
joke
to
be
sprung
just
at
this
time
gladys
made
a
discovery
there
was
only
one
window
in
the
room
curtained
with
heavy
cretonne
purple
to
match
the
rest
of
the
hangings
drawing
the
curtain
aside
to
look
out
at
the
landscape
she
suddenly
stood
still
frozen
to
the
spot
at
her
exclamation
nyoda
turned
around
and
also
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
window
was
what
does
it
mean
asked
gladys
in
a
horrified
voice
the
two
hastened
back
to
the
elevator
entrance
and
looked
for
the
button
to
summon
the
elevator
there
was
none
they
called
down
the
shaft
repeatedly
but
there
was
no
answer
as
they
stood
listening
for
sounds
from
below
they
heard
the
automobile
which
had
brought
them
start
up
and
drive
away
from
the
house
after
that
there
was
not
another
sound
of
any
kind
an
unnamable
terror
seized
them
both
each
read
the
other
fear
in
her
eyes
rushing
to
the
window
they
looked
out
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
lake
stretching
out
before
them
calm
and
smiling
in
the
may
sunshine
the
boom
of
the
waves
sounded
directly
beneath
them
and
they
knew
that
the
tower
was
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
bluff
this
is
not
norma
bates
house
said
nyoda
in
a
frightened
voice
she
said
that
they
were
a
hundred
feet
back
from
the
lake
whose
house
is
it
then
asked
gladys
i
ca
imagine
said
nyoda
it
all
a
mistake
somewhere
but
that
was
the
bates
automobile
all
right
that
we
got
into
said
gladys
yes
said
nyoda
reflectively
bright
blue
with
a
cane
streamer
standing
at
the
corner
of
th
avenue
and
l
street
was
it
the
right
one
she
asked
suddenly
putting
her
hands
to
her
head
that
driver
never
said
a
word
just
got
in
and
drove
off
what
on
earth
are
we
into
gladys
face
suddenly
went
as
white
as
chalk
nyoda
she
gasped
clutching
the
other
girl
arm
what
is
it
asked
nyoda
you
read
every
day
in
the
papers
of
girls
disappearing
said
gladys
faintly
never
to
be
heard
of
again
have
we
have
we
disappeared
i
do
know
said
nyoda
with
thoughts
whirling
she
turned
away
from
the
window
toward
the
elevator
not
a
sound
of
any
kind
had
been
heard
and
yet
when
she
turned
around
there
was
the
elevator
up
again
with
the
same
woman
in
it
who
had
brought
them
up
instead
of
opening
the
door
however
she
pressed
something
and
a
little
slide
opened
at
about
the
height
of
her
head
through
this
she
passed
a
supper
tray
which
she
set
on
a
shelf
on
the
wall
at
the
side
of
the
elevator
gladys
and
nyoda
hastened
toward
her
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
asked
nyoda
the
woman
made
no
answer
in
whose
house
are
we
demanded
nyoda
still
no
reply
answer
me
said
nyoda
sharply
the
woman
pointed
to
her
ears
and
shook
her
head
then
pointed
to
her
lips
and
shook
her
head
she
deaf
and
dumb
exclaimed
nyoda
the
woman
pressed
a
button
and
the
elevator
sank
from
sight
nyoda
and
gladys
faced
each
other
in
consternation
the
mystery
was
becoming
deeper
beyond
a
doubt
they
were
not
in
bates
house
beyond
a
doubt
they
were
the
victims
of
some
mistake
but
how
was
the
mistake
to
be
cleared
up
if
they
could
not
make
themselves
understood
they
looked
the
room
over
thoroughly
for
some
clew
to
the
mystery
they
found
none
there
was
no
door
leading
from
the
room
except
the
one
opening
into
the
bath
there
was
no
door
leading
out
from
the
bath
to
any
other
room
neither
was
there
any
window
the
little
room
was
lighted
by
electricity
as
in
the
other
room
everything
here
was
the
tiled
walls
the
floor
the
calcimined
ceiling
the
light
globe
the
enameled
medicine
chest
the
outside
of
the
bathtub
and
even
a
little
stool
were
all
the
same
shade
the
wonder
of
the
girls
increased
momentarily
can
this
be
real
asked
nyoda
looking
around
her
in
a
daze
or
are
we
in
the
middle
of
some
nightmare
pinch
me
to
see
if
i
awake
we
awake
all
right
said
gladys
then
have
we
dropped
back
into
one
of
the
novels
of
dumas
can
this
be
the
year
imprisoned
in
a
lonely
tower
with
no
window
except
one
over
the
lake
and
that
window
barred
how
did
we
get
here
anyway
she
asked
wearily
her
head
spinning
with
the
effort
to
make
head
or
tail
out
of
their
position
let
see
just
how
was
it
we
missed
the
limited
telephoned
bates
and
she
told
us
that
her
automobile
was
at
the
corner
of
th
avenue
and
l
street
a
bright
blue
automobile
with
a
cane
streamer
and
we
should
get
in
and
the
driver
would
come
and
take
us
out
to
bates
villa
we
went
down
to
the
corner
found
the
automobile
got
in
and
the
driver
came
and
drove
off
and
we
landed
here
her
temples
throbbed
as
she
tried
to
recall
anything
out
of
the
way
in
the
business
but
no
light
came
the
whole
thing
was
mysterious
inexplicable
grotesque
had
we
better
eat
something
suggested
gladys
gently
it
evidently
is
their
intention
to
starve
us
whatever
they
are
keeping
us
here
for
you
are
right
said
nyoda
and
she
lifted
the
tray
down
from
the
shelf
the
dishes
and
silver
were
of
good
quality
but
the
knives
were
so
dull
that
it
was
impossible
to
cut
anything
with
them
after
vainly
trying
to
make
an
impression
on
a
piece
of
meat
gladys
threw
her
knife
aside
impatiently
they
certainly
never
made
those
knives
to
cut
with
she
said
at
her
remark
nyoda
raised
her
head
suddenly
she
thought
she
saw
a
ray
of
light
on
the
situation
gladys
she
said
do
you
know
what
kind
of
people
they
give
dull
knives
to
it
insane
people
this
room
was
undoubtedly
designed
for
some
one
afflicted
in
that
way
that
is
why
the
window
is
barred
and
there
is
no
door
and
why
the
room
is
done
in
lavender
lavender
has
a
soothing
and
depressing
effect
on
nerves
and
would
probably
keep
an
insane
person
from
becoming
violent
we
got
here
through
some
awful
mistake
gladys
shuddered
violently
how
horrible
she
said
i
suppose
that
woman
actually
considers
us
insane
how
long
do
you
suppose
they
will
keep
us
here
only
until
they
find
out
their
mistake
answered
nyoda
which
i
hope
will
be
soon
i
shall
write
a
note
and
give
it
to
the
woman
when
she
comes
up
again
both
their
spirits
revived
when
they
arrived
at
this
theory
and
they
returned
to
their
supper
with
good
appetites
i
wish
i
could
cut
this
meat
sighed
gladys
then
she
brightened
i
have
my
wohelo
knife
in
my
handbag
she
said
rising
and
going
over
to
the
bed
where
her
coat
lay
she
stopped
in
disappointment
when
she
opened
the
bag
the
knife
was
not
there
i
remember
now
she
said
i
took
it
out
just
before
we
left
home
and
must
have
forgotten
to
put
it
back
in
again
we
left
in
such
a
hurry
what
will
the
girls
think
anyway
when
we
fail
to
arrive
at
the
bates
said
nyoda
they
probably
telephone
to
town
said
gladys
and
mother
will
know
i
did
get
there
and
she
will
be
frantic
she
lost
all
her
appetite
with
a
rush
when
this
thought
came
to
her
they
waited
impatiently
for
the
return
of
the
woman
with
the
tray
nyoda
wrote
a
note
and
had
it
ready
for
her
it
read
there
has
been
some
mistake
we
are
not
the
persons
you
intended
to
keep
here
but
the
woman
did
not
come
darkness
fell
outside
the
window
and
they
lighted
the
lights
in
the
room
but
still
there
was
no
movement
of
the
elevator
they
spent
the
evening
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
discussing
the
mysterious
situation
in
which
they
found
themselves
until
from
sheer
weariness
they
lay
down
on
the
bed
they
did
not
undress
and
they
left
the
lights
burning
intending
to
watch
for
the
return
of
the
woman
they
set
the
tray
on
the
floor
at
some
distance
from
the
elevator
can
it
be
possible
said
gladys
that
it
was
only
this
afternoon
that
we
broke
into
our
house
it
seems
years
ago
nyoda
lay
staring
at
the
elevator
shaft
awaiting
the
return
of
the
cage
this
purple
glare
over
everything
hurts
my
eyes
she
said
she
closed
them
a
minute
to
get
relief
when
she
opened
them
again
there
was
a
broad
streak
of
light
coming
in
through
the
window
the
lights
were
out
in
the
room
and
the
tray
had
disappeared
from
the
floor
gladys
lay
sound
asleep
her
head
pillowed
on
her
arm
nyoda
started
up
and
was
on
the
point
of
rousing
gladys
no
i
let
her
sleep
she
thought
it
a
good
thing
she
can
she
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
through
the
bars
at
the
sun
rising
over
the
water
there
was
the
same
old
lake
with
which
she
had
been
familiar
all
her
life
with
the
cliffs
jutting
out
in
points
one
always
a
little
farther
out
than
the
other
to
form
the
great
curve
of
the
shore
line
she
must
have
passed
this
place
dozens
of
times
while
riding
in
the
lake
boats
here
was
a
scene
she
had
admired
many
times
from
the
open
shore
and
now
she
was
looking
at
it
from
behind
bars
a
prisoner
it
was
too
grotesque
to
be
true
she
turned
pensively
toward
the
bed
and
noticed
with
a
start
that
a
tray
containing
breakfast
for
two
stood
on
the
shelf
beside
the
elevator
and
yet
she
had
not
heard
a
sound
gladys
was
still
asleep
on
the
bed
as
nyoda
stood
looking
down
at
her
she
woke
up
and
stared
around
the
room
uncomprehendingly
she
could
not
place
herself
at
first
then
at
the
sight
of
the
violet
room
the
events
of
yesterday
came
back
to
her
they
ate
breakfast
with
what
appetite
they
could
and
then
sat
down
close
beside
the
elevator
shaft
to
be
sure
and
see
the
when
she
came
for
it
seemed
impossible
to
detect
her
visit
when
they
had
their
backs
turned
while
they
waited
they
examined
the
iron
grating
for
the
door
opening
but
found
none
there
was
apparently
no
break
in
the
anywhere
no
hinge
no
slide
arrangement
did
we
come
into
the
room
through
there
or
did
we
only
imagine
it
asked
nyoda
completely
baffled
surely
we
did
come
through
that
little
grating
that
opens
on
top
did
we
i
declare
i
getting
so
bewildered
that
if
any
one
told
us
we
did
come
in
that
way
i
would
dispute
them
almost
while
she
was
speaking
the
elevator
cage
shot
rapidly
and
noiselessly
into
view
and
the
opened
the
slide
to
take
the
tray
instead
of
giving
it
to
her
however
they
gave
her
the
note
first
she
took
it
and
read
it
and
then
looked
at
the
two
girls
in
silence
maybe
she
would
write
something
if
you
gave
her
a
pencil
suggested
gladys
nyoda
handed
the
woman
a
pencil
through
the
iron
she
wrote
something
on
the
bottom
of
the
paper
and
handed
it
back
to
nyoda
nyoda
took
the
piece
of
paper
and
read
is
no
mistake
about
your
being
as
she
stood
in
astonishment
the
elevator
sank
from
view
chapter
xv
the
escape
no
mistake
about
our
being
here
gasped
nyoda
her
knees
failed
her
and
she
sank
weakly
to
the
floor
what
can
that
mean
are
we
kidnapped
do
you
suppose
we
are
being
held
for
ransom
it
too
horrible
said
gladys
passing
her
hand
over
her
eyes
such
things
happen
in
novels
but
not
in
real
life
and
yet
said
nyoda
musingly
if
you
read
the
newspapers
you
see
that
stranger
things
happen
in
reality
than
in
fiction
if
we
being
held
for
ransom
said
gladys
then
mother
and
father
will
find
out
where
i
am
she
was
more
troubled
about
the
worry
her
disappearance
would
cause
her
parents
than
about
any
evil
which
might
befall
herself
they
rushed
to
the
window
to
see
if
any
boat
was
passing
which
they
could
signal
not
a
sign
of
anything
whoever
had
constructed
this
tower
had
considered
a
great
many
things
built
in
the
middle
of
an
extensive
estate
and
hidden
on
three
sides
by
tall
trees
it
was
not
visible
from
the
road
at
all
the
barred
window
in
the
tower
could
only
be
seen
from
the
lake
side
so
that
if
some
one
should
wander
through
the
grounds
the
appearance
of
the
house
itself
would
excite
no
suspicion
at
some
distance
on
each
side
of
the
tower
a
long
rocky
pier
extended
far
out
into
the
water
it
was
not
a
landing
pier
for
the
rocks
were
piled
unevenly
on
each
other
these
rocks
changed
the
current
of
the
water
and
made
boating
in
the
vicinity
dangerous
so
that
launches
and
sailboats
gave
the
place
a
wide
berth
then
on
the
outside
of
the
barred
window
clearing
it
by
about
two
feet
there
was
an
ornamental
wooden
trellis
on
which
vines
grew
which
effectually
screened
the
barred
window
from
detection
on
the
lake
side
all
these
excellent
points
of
construction
were
borne
in
on
the
girls
as
they
circled
the
room
again
and
again
looking
for
some
way
of
escape
discouraged
and
heartsick
they
finally
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
faced
each
other
when
the
woman
brought
their
dinner
they
made
a
further
attempt
to
get
from
her
the
meaning
of
their
being
held
there
but
in
vain
to
all
their
written
questions
she
simply
wrote
i
can
tell
you
nothing
the
afternoon
dragged
slowly
by
the
girls
getting
more
dejected
all
the
time
i
believe
this
violet
color
is
affecting
me
already
said
nyoda
i
never
felt
so
depressed
and
melancholy
it
the
same
way
with
me
said
gladys
if
there
was
only
one
bright
spot
to
relieve
the
monotony
said
nyoda
it
would
be
so
bad
how
about
our
middy
ties
asked
gladys
they
bright
red
and
ought
to
inspire
courage
she
took
the
ties
from
her
little
satchel
and
spread
them
out
over
a
chair
that
better
said
nyoda
i
feel
more
cheerful
already
after
staring
intently
at
the
flaming
square
of
silk
for
a
while
her
mental
activity
began
to
revive
and
she
commenced
to
turn
over
in
her
mind
plans
for
their
escape
acting
on
this
latest
impulse
she
wrote
a
letter
addressed
to
a
friend
of
hers
and
sealed
and
stamped
it
when
the
brought
their
supper
she
drew
a
diamond
ring
from
her
finger
laid
it
beside
the
letter
and
wrote
on
a
piece
of
paper
the
ring
is
yours
if
you
will
mail
this
letter
the
woman
shook
her
head
nyoda
drew
off
another
ring
a
handsome
ruby
surrounded
by
seed
pearls
and
tiny
diamonds
the
woman
gazed
steadfastly
at
it
and
nyoda
thought
she
saw
a
longing
look
in
her
eyes
she
turned
the
ring
so
the
stone
sparkled
in
the
light
the
woman
lips
parted
and
her
hand
crept
toward
the
letter
nyoda
turned
the
ring
in
the
light
once
more
by
the
look
in
the
woman
face
she
knew
that
she
had
gained
her
point
in
another
moment
she
would
accept
the
bribe
just
then
the
throbbing
sound
of
a
motor
was
heard
on
the
drive
the
woman
started
violently
jerked
her
hand
back
and
sent
the
elevator
down
in
haste
with
a
gesture
of
despair
nyoda
threw
the
letter
down
on
the
dresser
do
you
suppose
she
really
is
deaf
asked
gladys
she
seemed
to
hear
that
sound
maybe
she
heard
it
said
nyoda
and
then
again
she
may
have
felt
the
vibrations
who
do
you
suppose
has
come
they
spent
the
evening
in
a
thrill
of
expectation
but
were
undisturbed
without
lighting
the
lights
they
stood
looking
at
the
stars
through
the
openings
in
the
trellis
at
last
nyoda
turned
from
the
window
and
snapped
on
the
switch
as
she
did
so
she
noticed
that
the
elevator
cage
had
been
up
and
was
just
going
down
as
it
sank
out
of
sight
she
saw
that
the
occupant
was
a
man
soon
afterward
they
heard
the
throb
of
the
motor
again
and
then
the
sound
of
a
car
driving
away
where
did
you
put
the
red
ties
asked
gladys
the
next
morning
i
did
take
them
said
nyoda
the
ties
had
disappeared
from
the
chair
overnight
from
sheer
nervousness
nyoda
began
twisting
up
her
felt
outing
hat
in
her
hands
as
she
did
so
she
came
upon
something
hard
in
the
inside
of
the
crown
investigating
she
drew
out
her
wohelo
knife
i
had
forgotten
i
had
it
in
there
she
said
i
put
that
pocket
in
my
hat
just
for
fun
and
slipped
the
knife
in
to
see
if
it
would
go
in
why
is
it
that
a
knife
in
one
hand
inspires
a
desire
to
cut
something
nyoda
immediately
began
examining
the
room
for
a
possible
means
of
escape
with
the
aid
of
the
knife
opening
the
window
she
inspected
the
setting
of
the
bars
closely
they
were
set
only
into
the
wooden
window
sill
gladys
she
whispered
excitedly
i
believe
we
can
cut
the
wood
away
from
these
bars
and
push
them
out
and
what
then
asked
gladys
jump
said
nyoda
jump
into
the
lake
and
swim
away
not
daring
to
make
any
attempt
in
the
daytime
for
fear
of
the
mysteriously
silent
visits
of
the
who
never
came
at
any
regular
time
they
waited
until
after
dark
and
then
gladys
sat
close
beside
the
elevator
shaft
watching
for
the
slightest
indication
of
the
approaching
car
nyoda
meanwhile
hacked
away
at
the
window
casing
cutting
and
splitting
it
away
from
the
bars
she
worked
feverishly
for
several
hours
and
succeeded
in
freeing
the
ends
of
three
of
the
bars
which
would
be
enough
to
let
them
through
just
then
gladys
gave
a
warning
hiss
the
elevator
cord
was
moving
nyoda
drew
the
shade
down
over
the
window
and
closed
the
purple
curtains
over
it
and
both
girls
jumped
into
bed
and
pulled
the
covers
over
them
they
had
undressed
so
as
to
avert
suspicion
the
next
moment
the
elevator
door
opened
silently
but
whether
it
moved
up
or
down
or
side
wise
they
could
not
make
out
and
the
stepped
into
the
room
guided
by
a
she
picked
up
gladys
red
petticoat
from
the
chair
and
departed
as
silently
as
she
had
come
as
soon
as
the
elevator
had
sunk
out
of
sight
the
girls
were
back
at
work
again
throwing
all
her
weight
against
the
bars
nyoda
bent
them
out
and
upward
the
wood
that
held
them
at
the
top
splintering
with
the
strain
then
leaning
out
she
began
to
cut
away
the
trellis
which
was
in
the
way
it
was
built
out
from
the
sill
and
had
no
supports
on
the
ground
and
the
vines
which
were
on
it
came
around
the
corner
of
the
house
looking
down
she
could
see
that
they
were
indeed
right
above
the
lake
without
a
foot
of
ground
at
the
bottom
of
the
tower
no
other
part
of
the
house
was
visible
from
this
angle
the
waves
roared
and
dashed
on
the
cliff
below
and
a
strong
wind
was
blowing
from
the
west
it
looks
as
if
a
storm
were
coming
said
nyoda
in
a
low
tone
the
night
was
wearing
away
fast
and
the
girls
knew
that
it
was
safer
to
escape
under
cover
of
darkness
about
three
in
the
morning
the
storm
broke
a
terrific
thunder
shower
the
tower
swayed
in
the
wind
and
at
each
crash
they
held
their
breath
thinking
that
the
house
had
been
struck
the
spray
from
the
waves
as
they
were
flung
against
the
rocks
often
came
in
through
the
open
window
both
girls
looked
down
into
the
boiling
sea
beneath
them
and
drew
back
with
a
shudder
wait
until
the
storm
is
over
said
gladys
it
may
be
daylight
then
said
nyoda
howling
like
an
imprisoned
giant
the
wind
hurled
itself
against
the
side
of
the
tower
there
one
thing
about
it
said
nyoda
we
never
can
swim
in
those
waves
with
skirts
on
i
going
to
have
a
bathing
suit
taking
the
blankets
from
the
bed
she
made
them
into
straight
narrow
sacks
cutting
various
holes
in
them
so
as
to
leave
the
arms
and
limbs
free
when
the
storm
had
abated
somewhat
they
prepared
for
the
plunge
the
first
faint
streaks
of
dawn
were
showing
in
the
east
gladys
crept
out
on
the
sill
and
then
shrank
back
the
surface
of
the
water
seemed
miles
below
her
i
ca
do
it
nyoda
she
panted
yes
you
can
said
nyoda
patting
her
on
the
shoulder
you
going
to
lose
your
nerve
at
this
stage
of
the
game
are
you
your
courage
to
the
sticking
point
we
have
our
fate
in
our
own
hands
now
hesitates
is
lost
but
the
water
is
so
far
away
shuddered
gladys
what
of
that
said
nyoda
it
perfectly
safe
to
jump
the
water
is
very
deep
along
the
shore
here
think
just
one
leap
and
then
we
out
of
this
gladys
still
hung
back
you
go
first
she
pleaded
nyoda
made
a
motion
to
go
and
then
stopped
no
she
said
firmly
rather
you
went
first
you
might
be
afraid
to
follow
me
afterward
brace
up
remember
you
a
winnebago
this
had
its
effect
and
without
allowing
herself
to
stop
to
think
gladys
tossed
her
bundle
of
clothes
out
of
the
window
and
closing
her
eyes
dropped
from
the
sill
there
was
a
wild
moment
of
suspense
as
she
sank
downward
through
the
gloom
and
then
she
struck
the
water
and
it
rolled
over
her
head
it
was
icy
cold
and
for
a
minute
she
felt
numb
then
the
waves
parted
over
her
head
and
she
felt
the
wind
blowing
against
her
face
a
great
splash
beside
her
terrified
her
for
an
instant
and
then
she
remembered
that
it
was
nyoda
jumping
in
after
her
in
a
moment
a
head
came
up
nearby
and
nyoda
inquired
calmly
how
she
enjoyed
the
bathing
it
said
gladys
with
chattering
teeth
now
for
a
little
pleasure
swim
said
nyoda
striking
out
while
they
were
swimming
away
the
storm
broke
the
second
time
the
thunder
sounded
in
their
ears
like
cannon
and
the
vivid
lightning
flashes
lit
up
the
shore
for
miles
around
by
its
light
they
could
see
that
they
were
nearing
one
of
the
long
stone
piers
climbing
up
on
this
they
rested
until
they
had
their
breath
back
again
although
it
was
a
rather
exciting
rest
for
the
waves
were
going
high
over
the
pier
and
threatened
to
wash
them
off
every
moment
the
shore
line
along
here
was
peculiarly
rugged
and
forbidding
instead
of
a
beach
high
cliffs
rose
perpendicularly
out
of
deep
water
and
afforded
nowhere
a
landing
place
the
girls
swam
slowly
and
easily
fearing
to
spend
their
strength
before
they
could
reach
shallow
water
often
turning
over
to
float
and
gain
a
few
moments
rest
in
this
way
the
waves
were
very
rough
and
tossed
them
about
a
great
deal
but
the
wind
was
west
and
they
were
swimming
toward
the
east
and
as
the
natural
current
of
the
lake
was
eastward
toward
niagara
their
progress
was
helped
rather
than
retarded
by
the
force
of
the
water
the
storm
abated
and
the
sun
began
to
rise
over
the
lake
gilding
the
crest
of
the
waves
still
no
sign
of
a
beach
i
ca
go
much
further
said
gladys
faintly
both
girls
were
nearly
spent
when
nyoda
spied
a
strip
of
yellow
in
the
distance
which
put
new
strength
into
them
putting
forth
their
last
efforts
they
headed
toward
it
trembling
with
weakness
and
breathless
from
being
buffeted
about
so
much
they
gained
the
narrow
beach
and
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
rolled
out
onto
the
sand

associate
and
intimate
friend
nathan
scovill
an
earnest
discussion
was
in
progress
the
theme
of
which
was
apparently
drawn
from
a
paper
which
was
spread
out
on
the
desk
between
them
i
tell
you
it
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
said
scovill
we
can
clean
up
a
cool
half
million
on
it
before
the
public
wakes
up
and
when
they
do
we
can
take
a
trip
to
hawaii
or
manila
for
our
health
until
the
business
is
forgotten
you
put
in
ten
thousand
now
and
you
be
on
easy
street
for
the
rest
of
your
life
but
i
tell
you
i
have
the
ten
thousand
to
put
in
answered
thurston
crossly
i
have
one
thousand
that
last
deal
finished
me
borrow
some
said
scovill
impatiently
ca
get
any
more
credit
said
thurston
gloomily
the
office
furniture
is
attached
already
scovill
scowled
then
he
went
carefully
over
the
ground
again
dwelling
on
the
ease
of
making
money
without
working
for
it
by
the
simple
method
of
swindling
the
public
and
enlarging
on
the
joys
of
life
as
a
rich
man
think
man
he
said
in
conclusion
think
what
missing
thurston
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
and
thought
of
what
he
was
missing
and
he
also
thought
of
something
else
a
peculiar
calculating
expression
appeared
in
his
eyes
and
around
the
corners
of
his
mouth
there
is
some
money
to
be
had
he
said
slowly
if
i
can
get
hold
of
it
where
asked
scovill
eagerly
if
it
to
be
had
you
may
rest
assured
we
get
hold
of
it
by
hook
or
crook
you
remember
john
rogers
asked
thurston
scovill
nodded
when
he
died
he
left
his
daughters
a
fortune
in
stocks
continued
thurston
yes
inquired
scovill
encouragingly
well
said
thurston
with
a
glitter
in
his
eye
i
was
appointed
guardian
of
those
two
girls
scovill
whistled
meaning
to
say
he
began
that
i
have
the
managing
of
their
property
until
they
come
of
age
finished
thurston
our
fortune
made
said
scovill
shaking
him
by
the
hand
the
only
thing
is
said
thurston
scratching
his
head
reflectively
that
the
oldest
girl
comes
of
age
in
june
and
there
might
be
an
awkward
inquiry
just
at
the
wrong
time
we
ca
afford
to
have
any
investigations
begun
inside
of
the
next
six
months
if
we
expect
to
carry
through
the
other
scheme
any
breath
of
scandal
would
wreck
our
prospects
scovill
face
fell
he
saw
only
too
clearly
the
truth
of
the
other
words
but
where
thurston
came
to
a
halt
in
front
of
a
dead
wall
scovill
scheming
mind
saw
the
loophole
but
just
suppose
he
said
slowly
that
there
should
be
any
investigation
when
the
oldest
girl
comes
of
age
suppose
she
should
never
put
in
a
claim
for
her
property
what
do
you
mean
asked
thurston
something
like
this
said
scovill
if
she
were
to
be
kept
shut
up
somewhere
for
a
year
or
so
until
you
have
had
time
to
make
your
fortune
it
would
be
too
late
to
hurt
you
with
a
disclosure
after
that
where
nobody
asks
questions
there
is
no
need
of
answering
thurston
saw
the
point
but
he
did
see
how
it
was
going
to
be
done
it
was
scovill
who
thought
out
the
whole
scheme
he
had
a
large
piece
of
land
far
outside
the
city
limits
on
the
lake
front
there
was
an
unoccupied
house
on
the
property
here
the
girl
could
be
kept
locked
up
on
the
pretext
that
she
was
insane
with
a
certain
woman
he
knew
as
keeper
a
he
shared
a
secret
with
her
and
could
use
this
knowledge
to
force
her
to
serve
him
the
whole
thing
was
very
simple
but
how
are
we
going
to
keep
the
one
locked
up
away
from
the
other
asked
thurston
her
sister
would
have
the
whole
country
searching
for
her
then
take
them
both
said
scovill
promptly
that
make
matters
simpler
yet
you
say
they
have
no
relatives
and
are
now
away
in
school
nothing
could
be
easier
we
build
a
room
they
ca
get
out
of
once
they
in
and
when
it
finished
you
invite
them
to
your
house
for
a
visit
they
think
they
coming
to
see
you
but
it
out
there
to
that
house
they
go
and
they
not
come
back
in
a
hurry
in
the
meantime
you
get
hold
of
those
stocks
and
bonds
sell
them
and
put
the
money
in
this
venture
and
come
out
a
rich
man
when
you
ready
to
clear
out
of
the
country
you
can
let
the
girls
out
and
they
wo
be
any
worse
off
than
when
they
went
in
except
that
they
wo
have
a
cent
bit
by
bit
the
plan
was
perfected
thurston
took
a
sudden
interest
in
his
orphan
wards
to
the
extent
of
writing
to
the
school
where
they
were
attending
and
asking
when
it
closed
for
the
summer
when
he
was
informed
that
school
closed
the
last
week
in
may
he
invited
the
two
girls
genevieve
and
antoinette
rogers
to
spend
the
first
weeks
of
their
vacation
at
his
home
he
had
not
seen
either
of
them
since
they
were
little
children
they
graciously
accepted
the
invitation
but
on
the
day
they
were
to
arrive
thurston
found
that
some
private
business
of
his
very
urgently
required
his
presence
in
another
city
and
left
scovill
to
see
to
the
landing
of
the
birds
in
the
trap
scovill
met
the
unsuspecting
girls
at
the
train
explaining
with
many
expressions
of
regret
the
enforced
absence
of
their
guardian
took
them
to
dinner
in
a
fine
hotel
and
showed
them
the
sights
of
the
town
with
all
the
cordiality
of
a
sincere
friend
of
their
host
who
was
doing
his
best
to
make
up
for
his
not
being
there
he
won
their
hearts
completely
they
were
simple
girls
who
had
been
brought
up
in
a
strict
church
school
and
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
large
city
were
all
wonderful
to
them
now
thanks
to
scovill
activities
the
trap
was
all
set
the
tower
was
built
with
its
room
at
the
top
without
any
door
and
its
barred
window
and
the
was
installed
on
the
place
and
given
instructions
to
act
as
guard
to
two
girls
who
were
mentally
unbalanced
furnishing
the
room
in
violet
was
the
last
touch
of
his
cunning
brain
because
he
knew
the
depressing
effect
it
would
have
on
the
inmates
he
gave
strict
orders
to
the
keeper
to
remove
any
sign
of
a
bright
color
as
this
might
cause
them
to
become
violent
scovill
had
left
directions
for
his
automobile
to
be
at
a
certain
place
at
four
to
convey
them
to
the
house
in
the
country
now
for
reasons
of
his
own
scovill
did
not
wish
to
be
the
last
one
seen
in
the
company
of
the
two
girls
in
case
his
plans
should
go
wrong
and
some
one
would
start
an
inquiry
for
them
therefore
he
gave
his
driver
private
instructions
to
drive
like
the
wind
with
two
girls
who
should
be
placed
in
the
car
and
under
no
condition
to
let
them
out
of
the
car
accordingly
when
they
were
all
a
little
weary
of
he
steered
them
gently
toward
the
corner
of
th
avenue
and
l
street
where
the
car
was
to
wait
for
them
half
a
block
off
he
saw
that
it
was
in
place
so
pulling
out
his
watch
and
suddenly
remembering
that
he
had
an
important
engagement
for
that
very
minute
he
courteously
took
his
leave
and
pointed
out
the
car
they
were
to
get
into
telling
them
that
it
was
thurston
and
would
take
them
to
his
home
you
ca
miss
it
girls
he
said
pointing
with
his
finger
it
that
bright
blue
one
with
the
streamer
antoinette
and
genevieve
thanked
him
kindly
for
showing
them
such
a
good
time
and
entered
the
car
he
had
indicated
scovill
withdrew
into
a
doorway
and
watched
them
in
a
few
moments
the
driver
appeared
saw
the
two
girls
in
the
machine
touched
his
hat
to
them
and
taking
his
place
behind
the
wheel
drove
rapidly
off
in
the
opposite
direction
scovill
rubbed
his
hands
together
as
he
watched
the
car
disappear
it
was
a
way
he
had
when
his
plans
were
turning
out
nicely
minutes
later
his
driver
called
up
from
the
country
house
to
say
that
he
had
brought
the
girls
out
in
safety
scovill
smiled
blandly
so
far
everything
had
played
into
his
hands
when
thurston
returned
the
following
day
he
announced
the
fact
to
him
that
the
birds
were
safe
in
the
trap
then
he
left
town
for
a
protracted
stay
thurston
made
one
trip
out
to
the
house
to
behold
the
thing
for
himself
riding
up
in
the
elevator
he
saw
the
girls
standing
by
the
barred
window
of
their
prison
when
they
lit
the
light
he
descended
in
haste
so
as
not
to
be
seen
by
them
then
he
also
left
town
for
a
while
the
winnebagos
who
were
all
in
time
for
the
limited
except
nyoda
and
gladys
boarded
the
car
without
them
and
amused
themselves
during
the
ride
by
thinking
up
ways
to
tease
the
tardy
ones
when
they
should
arrive
on
the
next
car
pretty
bates
met
them
at
the
car
stop
with
the
news
that
nyoda
and
gladys
were
coming
out
in
the
automobile
and
when
they
thought
it
was
time
for
them
to
arrive
they
all
lined
up
in
the
road
where
the
drive
turned
off
and
were
ready
to
sing
a
funny
song
which
migwan
had
made
up
about
not
getting
there
on
time
the
blue
car
came
in
sight
and
the
girls
ranged
themselves
straight
across
the
road
so
it
could
not
pass
until
the
entire
song
had
been
sung
with
mouths
open
ready
to
sing
they
stopped
in
astonishment
the
two
girls
in
the
tonneau
were
strangers
they
smiled
bashfully
at
the
row
of
maidens
with
the
bright
red
ties
bates
stepped
forward
whom
have
you
brought
us
john
she
asked
why
you
said
there
be
two
girls
in
the
car
when
i
came
out
answered
the
driver
and
there
were
oh
is
there
any
mistake
asked
one
of
the
strange
girls
our
names
are
genevieve
and
antoinette
rogers
we
come
up
from
seaville
to
visit
our
guardian
thurston
he
could
meet
us
and
another
gentleman
pointed
out
his
automobile
and
said
the
driver
would
take
us
out
to
thurston
country
place
and
we
got
in
and
he
brought
us
here
this
is
bates
villa
said
bates
you
undoubtedly
got
into
our
car
by
mistake
i
sorry
this
is
not
the
right
place
said
antoinette
in
a
tone
of
frank
regret
i
was
so
glad
when
i
saw
all
you
girls
and
thought
you
were
to
be
our
friends
you
will
be
very
welcome
guests
until
your
guardian
comes
for
you
said
bates
in
her
gracious
way
the
winnebagos
were
much
amused
to
think
that
gladys
and
nyoda
had
missed
their
chance
to
ride
out
in
the
automobile
and
added
another
verse
to
the
song
to
be
sung
when
they
should
arrive
on
the
next
limited
bates
found
thurston
name
in
the
telephone
book
and
called
his
residence
but
could
get
no
answer
now
scovill
had
introduced
himself
to
genevieve
and
antoinette
as
mr
adams
they
did
not
know
his
initials
and
attempts
to
get
him
on
the
wire
were
futile
the
girls
all
went
down
to
the
when
it
was
time
for
the
next
limited
a
regular
fusilade
of
jests
and
jibes
were
prepared
for
nyoda
and
gladys
the
limited
appeared
and
thundered
by
without
stopping
not
on
this
one
said
the
girls
what
on
earth
could
have
happened
here
comes
another
car
said
hinpoha
they
running
a
nyoda
and
gladys
must
be
on
this
one
the
second
car
whizzed
by
with
a
deafening
clatter
and
a
cloud
of
dust
maybe
they
not
coming
said
one
of
the
girls
and
disappointment
was
visible
on
every
face
this
jolly
party
would
not
be
complete
without
their
beloved
guardian
and
gladys
bates
telephoned
to
the
evans
house
in
town
but
there
was
nobody
home
she
tried
the
house
where
nyoda
lived
but
got
no
satisfaction
for
the
landlady
merely
said
that
miss
kent
had
not
been
home
since
leaving
for
school
in
the
morning
the
evening
passed
off
as
merrily
as
possible
and
the
girls
rose
the
next
morning
feeling
sure
that
nyoda
and
gladys
would
be
out
on
the
first
car
but
the
day
passed
with
no
sign
of
them
they
telephoned
to
the
evans
again
and
this
time
they
got
evans
gladys
has
arrived
there
she
asked
in
a
frightened
voice
she
was
at
home
last
night
where
can
she
be
wonder
gave
way
to
anxiety
on
all
sides
and
there
was
no
more
thought
of
fun
they
must
be
out
at
thurston
of
course
suggested
antoinette
rogers
renewed
efforts
were
made
to
get
into
communication
with
thurston
but
in
vain
no
answer
came
from
the
number
which
was
opposite
his
name
in
the
telephone
book
genevieve
and
antoinette
were
highly
embarrassed
at
being
obliged
to
stay
with
strangers
and
were
not
a
little
mystified
over
the
of
their
guardian
the
days
passed
in
frightful
suspense
for
the
parents
and
friends
of
the
missing
girls
the
aid
of
the
police
was
called
in
but
they
could
find
no
clue
early
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
evans
was
called
to
the
phone
and
was
overjoyed
to
hear
gladys
voice
on
the
wire
she
and
nyoda
were
at
a
house
on
the
lake
shore
and
would
be
home
soon
there
was
a
happy
that
morning
nyoda
and
gladys
told
the
almost
unbelievable
tale
of
their
imprisonment
and
escape
from
the
tower
after
lying
exhausted
on
the
beach
for
a
time
they
had
walked
until
they
came
to
a
house
where
they
were
warmed
and
lent
dry
clothes
for
they
had
lost
their
bundles
in
the
waves
and
that
what
would
have
become
of
us
said
antoinette
rogers
with
a
shudder
when
nyoda
and
gladys
had
finished
their
story
if
we
had
not
made
a
mistake
and
gotten
into
the
wrong
automobile
the
police
were
informed
of
the
matter
and
as
soon
as
thurston
returned
to
his
place
of
business
he
was
arrested
and
charged
with
the
conspiracy
to
abduct
and
forcibly
detain
his
two
wards
at
first
he
denied
any
knowledge
of
the
affair
but
the
proof
was
overwhelming
nyoda
accompanied
a
delegation
of
police
and
witnesses
in
a
motor
boat
to
the
foot
of
the
tower
and
showed
them
the
bars
and
the
very
place
where
they
had
jumped
into
the
water
and
later
they
raided
the
house
from
the
land
side
the
deaf
mute
was
nowhere
to
be
found
she
had
fled
when
she
discovered
that
her
charges
had
escaped
and
was
never
heard
of
again
they
ascended
in
the
elevator
but
were
unable
to
find
the
contrivance
which
opened
the
door
into
the
room
so
cunningly
was
it
devised
and
had
to
be
content
with
looking
through
the
into
the
lavender
room
the
rogers
girls
who
were
taken
away
from
the
guardianship
of
thurston
went
to
stay
with
friends
in
cincinnati
thurston
was
left
to
pay
the
penalty
of
his
villainy
alone
for
scovill
had
made
good
his
escape
before
the
plot
was
disclosed
thus
nyoda
and
gladys
all
unknowingly
were
the
cause
of
a
great
crime
being
averted
and
were
regarded
as
heroines
forevermore
by
the
winnebagos
and
their
friends

was
hard
which
was
the
reason
hinpoha
had
had
no
success
in
cutting
it
and
the
knife
in
aunt
phoebe
hand
slipped
and
plunged
into
her
wrist
the
blood
spurted
high
in
the
air
aunt
phoebe
screamed
i
bleeding
to
death
hinpoha
did
not
scream
she
took
a
handkerchief
and
calmly
made
a
tourniquet
above
the
gash
twisting
it
tight
with
a
lead
pencil
then
she
telephoned
for
josephy
aunt
phoebe
physician
he
was
out
frantically
she
tried
doctor
after
doctor
but
not
a
single
one
was
to
be
had
at
once
hoffman
she
knew
was
at
the
hospital
one
of
the
doctors
she
had
telephoned
was
said
to
be
making
a
call
on
the
street
where
she
lived
and
she
ran
down
there
but
he
had
already
left
running
back
toward
the
house
she
collided
sharply
with
a
man
on
the
street
it
was
hoffman
who
was
obligingly
coming
up
to
deliver
a
message
from
sahwah
come
quickly
she
cried
catching
hold
of
his
hand
and
starting
to
run
aunt
phoebe
will
bleed
to
death
hoffman
hurried
to
the
spot
and
tied
up
the
severed
artery
who
put
on
de
tourniquet
he
asked
i
did
replied
hinpoha
good
vork
good
vork
said
hoffman
approvingly
if
it
had
not
ben
for
dat
it
vould
haf
been
too
late
ven
i
came
where
did
you
learn
to
do
that
asked
aunt
phoebe
camp
fire
first
aid
class
replied
hinpoha
humph
said
aunt
phoebe
but
she
did
some
thinking
nevertheless
and
was
fully
aware
that
it
was
hinpoha
prompt
action
which
had
saved
her
from
bleeding
to
death
her
arm
was
tied
up
for
some
days
afterward
and
she
was
unable
to
use
it
hinpoha
waited
on
her
with
angelic
patience
i
changed
my
mind
about
this
camp
fire
business
said
aunt
phoebe
abruptly
one
day
more
sense
to
it
than
i
thought
if
you
want
to
have
meetings
here
i
have
no
objection
hinpoha
nearly
swooned
but
managed
to
say
gratefully
thank
you
aunt
phoebe
hinpoha
began
to
wonder
as
she
was
thus
thrown
into
closer
contact
with
her
aunt
whether
aunt
phoebe
austere
tastes
came
from
her
having
such
a
narrow
nature
or
because
she
had
never
known
anything
different
she
could
not
help
noticing
that
there
were
woefully
few
friends
who
came
to
see
her
during
her
indisposition
the
daily
visit
of
the
doctor
was
about
the
only
break
in
the
monotony
from
a
fierce
dislike
feelings
changed
to
pity
i
wonder
if
aunt
phoebe
is
ever
lonesome
she
thought
i
do
see
how
she
can
help
being
a
line
of
her
fire
song
was
ringing
in
her
ears
whose
hand
above
this
blaze
is
lifted
shall
be
with
magic
touch
engifted
to
warm
the
hearts
of
lonely
mortals
i
wonder
if
i
could
bring
something
else
into
her
life
thought
hinpoha
at
least
i
going
to
try
aunt
phoebe
never
read
anything
but
religious
books
all
her
life
i
like
to
read
her
a
corking
good
story
once
timidly
she
essayed
it
would
you
like
to
have
me
read
you
something
else
before
we
begin
the
next
volume
she
asked
when
the
third
volume
conveniently
came
to
an
end
do
as
you
like
said
aunt
phoebe
who
was
profoundly
bored
hinpoha
accordingly
brought
out
the
count
of
monte
cristo
which
she
had
been
reading
when
the
ban
went
on
fiction
and
it
was
not
long
before
aunt
phoebe
was
as
excited
over
the
mystery
as
she
was
romance
long
dead
in
her
heart
began
to
show
signs
of
coming
to
life
hinpoha
looking
for
a
certain
little
shawl
to
put
around
aunt
shoulders
one
afternoon
opened
up
the
big
cedar
chest
that
stood
in
her
room
she
had
never
seen
inside
of
it
before
the
shawl
was
not
there
but
there
were
quantities
of
table
and
bed
linens
all
elaborately
embroidered
and
whole
sets
of
undergarments
trimmed
with
the
wonderfully
fine
crochet
work
at
which
aunt
phoebe
was
a
master
hand
what
can
all
these
things
be
wondered
hinpoha
aunt
phoebe
certainly
never
uses
them
a
little
further
down
she
came
upon
a
filmy
white
dress
and
a
veil
fastened
onto
a
wreath
then
she
knew
this
was
her
aunt
wedding
outfit
the
garments
she
had
fashioned
in
her
girlhood
in
preparation
for
the
marriage
which
was
destined
never
to
take
place
a
week
before
the
wedding
the
had
run
away
with
another
girl
the
pathos
of
aunt
phoebe
blighted
romance
struck
hinpoha
amidships
as
sahwah
would
have
expressed
it
and
she
wept
over
the
linens
in
the
cedar
chest
poor
aunt
phoebe
no
wonder
she
was
sour
and
crabbed
hinpoha
forgave
her
all
her
crossness
and
tartness
of
manner
and
thought
of
her
only
with
pity
her
romantic
nature
thrilled
at
the
thought
of
the
blighted
love
affair
and
her
aunt
became
a
sort
of
heroine
in
her
eyes
she
yearned
to
comfort
her
and
make
her
happy
downstairs
aunt
phoebe
sat
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
it
was
from
aunt
grace
hinpoha
mother
sister
out
in
california
aunt
grace
had
no
children
and
was
lonely
and
was
asking
if
hinpoha
could
come
and
live
with
her
aunt
phoebe
pondered
of
late
there
had
been
growing
on
her
a
conviction
that
she
was
not
a
suitable
person
to
bring
up
a
young
girl
she
certainly
had
not
succeeded
in
making
her
grandniece
love
her
aunt
phoebe
really
was
lonely
and
she
did
care
for
hinpoha
but
she
did
not
know
how
to
make
her
care
for
her
her
experiment
had
been
a
failure
well
she
would
send
hinpoha
out
to
california
with
her
aunt
grace
whom
hinpoha
adored
and
she
would
live
on
by
herself
the
prospect
suddenly
seemed
rather
dismal
and
she
confessed
that
hinpoha
had
been
a
great
deal
of
company
for
her
but
she
would
not
stand
in
the
way
of
her
happiness
her
mind
was
made
up
she
pictured
the
joy
with
which
hinpoha
would
receive
the
news
and
it
brought
her
another
pang
at
the
supper
table
she
told
hinpoha
that
after
school
was
out
she
was
to
go
west
and
live
with
aunt
grace
and
then
sat
cynically
watching
the
unbelieving
delight
which
flashed
into
her
face
at
this
announcement
but
after
the
first
flush
of
rapture
hinpoha
reconsidered
in
her
eye
she
saw
aunt
phoebe
living
on
alone
unloving
and
unloved
to
a
lonesome
old
age
again
she
saw
the
cedar
chest
with
its
pathetic
wedding
garments
again
the
words
of
the
fire
song
came
into
her
mind
do
i
have
to
go
to
aunt
grace
she
asked
not
unless
you
want
to
said
her
aunt
wondering
then
i
think
i
rather
stay
with
you
said
hinpoha
do
you
really
mean
it
asked
aunt
phoebe
incredulously
the
ice
was
melting
in
her
heart
and
something
was
beginning
to
sing
hinpoha
slipped
out
of
her
chair
and
going
around
behind
aunt
phoebe
put
her
arms
around
her
neck
the
gate
of
aunt
phoebe
heart
swung
wide
open
reaching
out
her
arms
she
drew
hinpoha
down
into
her
lap
my
dear
little
girl
she
said
my
dear
little
girl
and
the
of
suddenly
blossomed
with
a
thousand
roses
and
hinpoha
saw
lying
fair
before
her
in
the
sunlight
the
of
her
heart
migwan
was
once
more
in
the
dumps
the
heavy
strain
under
which
she
had
been
working
all
winter
coupled
with
the
constant
worry
and
disappointment
produced
the
inevitable
result
and
she
broke
down
she
was
chosen
a
commencement
speaker
and
the
added
work
of
writing
a
graduating
essay
was
the
last
straw
she
might
be
able
to
attend
the
graduating
exercises
of
her
class
said
the
doctor
but
she
was
not
to
go
to
school
any
more
and
of
course
there
was
to
be
no
speech
prepared
he
would
not
hear
of
her
working
in
an
office
during
the
summer
so
her
last
hope
of
going
to
college
in
the
fall
went
glimmering
but
really
this
last
disappointment
did
not
affect
her
as
strongly
as
the
others
had
done
she
was
getting
used
to
having
everything
she
touched
crumble
to
dust
and
besides
she
felt
too
tired
to
care
which
way
things
went
any
more
thus
the
month
of
may
brought
widely
different
experiences
to
the
various
girls
and
went
on
its
way
giving
them
into
the
keeping
of
the
rose
moon
on
one
of
the
rarest
of
rare
days
that
ever
a
poet
dreamed
of
as
belonging
to
june
the
winnebagos
found
themselves
skimming
over
the
country
roads
on
a
saturday
afternoon
frolic
there
were
three
automobile
loads
altogether
for
all
the
mothers
were
along
besides
aunt
phoebe
and
hoffman
it
was
a
double
occasion
for
celebration
for
besides
being
the
rose
moon
ceremonial
meeting
it
was
the
day
when
sahwah
was
to
lay
aside
her
crutches
permanently
the
cast
had
been
removed
several
weeks
before
and
the
splintered
joint
was
found
to
be
as
good
as
ever
and
migwan
although
she
did
not
know
it
yet
had
more
cause
to
celebrate
than
all
the
rest
put
together
taken
all
in
all
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
a
merrier
crowd
than
that
which
sped
over
the
smooth
yellow
road
on
this
perfect
summer
day
and
many
a
bird
balancing
himself
on
a
blossoming
twig
ceased
his
ecstatic
outpouring
of
melody
to
listen
to
the
blithe
chorus
of
these
earth
birds
as
they
sang
hey
ho
for
merry
june
and
let
the
hills
and
dales
resound
each
machineful
trying
its
best
to
outdo
the
others
and
when
they
came
to
a
sunny
hill
thickly
starred
with
snowy
daisies
they
stopped
the
automobiles
and
picked
great
armfuls
of
the
blossoms
and
aunt
phoebe
and
hoffman
wandered
off
by
themselves
to
the
other
side
of
the
hill
in
search
of
larger
and
finer
ones
migwan
mother
sitting
on
the
hillside
with
the
warm
sweet
breeze
blowing
in
her
face
felt
the
joy
of
health
and
strength
returning
with
a
rush
oh
she
sighed
blissfully
to
evans
who
sat
beside
her
i
have
had
such
a
good
time
since
we
all
went
coasting
that
night
i
declare
i
impatient
for
winter
to
return
so
we
can
do
it
again
who
says
we
have
to
wait
for
winter
before
we
can
go
coasting
said
hinpoha
who
had
overheard
the
remark
you
just
watch
this
child
climbing
to
the
top
of
the
hill
she
beat
a
path
down
the
slope
and
then
sat
calmly
down
with
her
feet
stretched
out
before
her
and
slid
down
as
swiftly
as
if
the
hill
had
been
covered
with
ice
she
had
no
sooner
accomplished
the
feat
than
all
the
winnebagos
were
at
the
top
of
the
hill
eager
to
try
it
they
came
down
all
in
a
row
each
with
her
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
girl
ahead
of
her
so
that
it
looked
like
a
real
toboggan
then
evans
tried
it
pulling
with
her
stout
brewster
who
puffed
like
an
engine
and
got
stuck
half
way
down
and
had
to
be
pushed
the
rest
of
the
way
then
hoffman
and
aunt
phoebe
returned
from
their
ramble
and
the
mothers
hastily
collected
their
dignity
and
their
hairpins
breathless
but
bubbling
over
with
the
fun
of
it
whoever
has
not
slid
down
a
grassy
hillside
in
june
has
certainly
missed
a
joy
out
of
his
life
they
had
frolicked
so
long
in
the
daisy
field
that
there
was
no
time
to
go
on
to
the
place
where
they
had
intended
to
cook
their
supper
and
they
had
to
stay
right
there
aunt
phoebe
had
her
first
taste
of
camp
cookery
on
this
occasion
and
was
delighted
beyond
words
with
the
experience
as
was
doctor
hoffman
sometime
you
and
i
vill
go
camping
and
you
vill
make
someting
like
dis
mein
liebchen
he
said
to
aunt
phoebe
indicating
the
slumgullion
the
group
sat
petrified
at
the
term
he
had
used
in
addressing
her
and
aunt
phoebe
blushed
fiery
red
hoffman
saw
that
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag
laughing
sheepishly
he
spoke
dis
lady
he
said
laying
his
hand
on
aunt
phoebe
has
promised
to
be
mein
vife
hinpoha
dropped
her
plate
in
her
surprise
aunt
phoebe
she
cried
incredulously
throwing
her
arms
around
her
then
her
face
fell
you
are
going
away
and
leave
me
she
asked
anxiously
no
dear
answered
aunt
phoebe
the
doctor
is
going
to
make
his
home
here
and
we
will
keep
you
with
us
always
and
hinpoha
though
still
dazed
by
the
news
she
had
just
heard
breathed
easy
again
when
the
last
bit
of
slumgullion
was
eaten
and
doctor
hoffman
had
scraped
out
the
kettle
the
winnebagos
retired
to
the
other
side
of
the
hill
to
don
their
ceremonial
costumes
and
the
rest
of
the
company
found
comfortable
seats
on
the
ground
from
which
to
watch
the
coming
performance
as
migwan
was
wriggling
into
her
gown
a
letter
fell
to
the
ground
the
mail
man
had
handed
it
to
her
just
as
she
was
starting
off
with
the
crowd
and
she
had
thrust
it
into
her
blouse
to
read
later
being
dressed
a
few
minutes
ahead
of
the
rest
she
tore
open
the
envelope
while
she
was
waiting
for
them
if
the
other
girls
had
been
watching
her
as
she
read
it
they
would
have
seen
her
clasp
her
hands
together
suddenly
and
draw
in
her
breath
sharply
just
then
clear
wohelo
call
sounded
and
she
went
with
the
rest
into
the
circle
around
the
fire
the
doctor
noted
with
a
thrill
of
artistic
pleasure
how
each
girl
as
she
came
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
stood
silhouetted
against
the
red
line
of
the
sun
for
an
instant
a
ripple
of
tender
amusement
went
among
the
watchers
as
althea
was
borne
in
clad
in
her
little
ceremonial
dress
and
headband
as
this
was
the
big
council
meeting
of
the
year
it
was
more
elaborately
staged
than
the
ordinary
ceremonial
meeting
instead
of
a
large
fire
being
kindled
in
the
center
of
the
circle
the
first
thing
four
fires
were
laid
one
in
the
center
and
three
small
ones
around
it
in
the
form
of
a
triangle
the
girls
were
divided
into
three
groups
to
represent
work
health
and
love
each
group
in
turn
tried
to
light
the
big
fire
in
the
center
but
in
vain
it
went
out
every
time
sorrowfully
the
groups
returned
to
their
own
small
woodpiles
which
they
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
light
suddenly
a
little
bent
old
woman
appeared
from
somewhere
and
stood
beside
the
work
group
shivering
with
cold
the
stranger
is
cold
said
one
of
the
work
maidens
we
must
light
our
fire
for
her
sake
even
if
it
is
not
worth
while
for
ourselves
the
fire
was
lighted
and
the
little
old
woman
stretched
out
her
hands
to
the
cheerful
blaze
until
she
was
warmed
through
then
with
a
blessing
on
the
work
maidens
she
went
her
way
faint
with
hunger
she
stopped
beside
the
health
maidens
and
begged
a
bite
of
food
we
must
light
our
fire
and
cook
something
for
this
hungry
stranger
said
one
of
the
health
maidens
even
if
it
is
not
worth
lighting
for
ourselves
so
they
lit
their
fire
and
solemnly
broiled
a
wiener
which
the
little
old
lady
devoured
eagerly
and
passed
on
likewise
giving
them
her
blessing
when
she
came
to
the
love
group
it
was
quite
dark
and
she
begged
a
light
from
them
that
she
might
find
her
way
up
the
mountain
so
they
lit
their
fire
and
handed
her
a
torch
upon
which
she
straightened
up
and
threw
off
her
poor
cloak
and
revealed
herself
as
a
young
and
beautiful
maiden
the
good
fairy
who
inhabited
those
parts
holding
her
torch
aloft
she
began
to
dance
in
and
out
among
the
three
fires
as
lightly
as
a
wandering
night
breeze
suddenly
she
stooped
to
the
health
fire
and
picked
up
a
burning
brand
then
darting
to
the
work
fire
she
picked
up
a
burning
brand
then
running
to
the
great
pile
of
firewood
in
the
center
of
the
circle
she
flung
all
three
down
together
the
mingled
fires
of
work
health
and
love
kindled
the
fire
of
wohelo
which
each
one
separately
had
failed
to
light
and
as
the
flames
mounted
in
the
big
fire
the
little
fires
were
scattered
and
stamped
out
and
the
girls
sprang
to
their
feet
singing
burn
fire
burn
a
round
of
applause
followed
this
masterly
presentation
and
nyoda
who
had
worked
it
out
was
called
on
to
make
a
speech
a
fine
little
bit
of
not
planned
for
by
nyoda
was
staged
when
sahwah
dramatically
cast
her
crutches
into
the
fire
of
health
now
this
meeting
was
the
time
when
the
diaries
were
to
be
finished
and
the
most
interesting
looking
one
was
to
be
interpreted
if
the
girl
was
willing
to
do
so
what
tales
were
worked
out
in
the
bands
belonging
to
migwan
hinpoha
sahwah
gladys
and
nyoda
nyoda
hesitated
a
long
time
trying
to
decide
which
looked
the
most
interesting
hinpoha
or
migwan
and
finally
decided
on
migwan
nothing
loth
migwan
told
the
story
of
her
hard
time
during
the
winter
and
the
girls
in
the
circle
and
the
visitors
alike
were
stirred
by
the
account
of
the
party
dress
and
the
family
budget
and
the
returned
manuscripts
and
the
vanishing
college
fund
there
is
one
incident
not
yet
recorded
she
said
as
she
came
to
the
end
of
the
figures
on
the
band
and
i
really
think
this
ought
to
be
told
with
the
rest
from
the
beaded
pocket
of
her
ceremonial
gown
she
drew
the
letter
which
she
had
read
while
the
girls
were
dressing
it
was
from
bartlett
the
mother
of
little
raymond
and
read
as
follows
to
say
i
was
touched
to
the
heart
by
your
story
of
where
the
college
money
went
is
putting
it
mildly
if
any
one
ever
put
up
a
brave
fight
against
circumstances
you
have
i
showed
the
letter
to
my
husband
and
he
was
as
much
affected
as
i
and
curiously
enough
a
letter
which
we
had
received
earlier
in
the
day
and
which
had
caused
us
much
vexation
contained
news
of
a
certain
state
of
affairs
which
is
going
to
give
us
a
chance
to
help
you
out
of
your
difficulty
we
own
a
small
farm
just
outside
of
cleveland
and
for
years
this
has
been
worked
for
us
by
a
man
and
his
wife
just
this
week
this
man
is
leaving
our
employ
to
take
up
some
other
line
of
work
leaving
the
farm
without
a
caretaker
at
a
critical
time
when
the
spring
vegetables
are
all
up
and
need
attention
now
our
proposition
is
this
believing
that
as
a
camp
fire
girl
you
know
a
great
deal
about
growing
things
we
are
going
to
ask
you
to
take
charge
of
the
place
for
the
summer
and
will
gladly
allow
you
whatever
profit
you
may
make
from
the
sale
of
vegetables
and
small
fruits
if
you
will
see
that
the
peach
crop
is
brought
through
in
good
shape
and
keep
the
trees
from
being
destroyed
by
bugs
we
will
attend
to
the
marketing
of
the
peaches
ourselves
when
the
time
comes
good
luck
to
you
if
you
want
to
undertake
the
job
your
loving
friend
mabel
e
bartlett
we
have
no
objection
if
you
wish
to
use
the
house
for
a
camp
fire
club
house
during
the
summer
a
rousing
cheer
burst
from
the
group
around
the
fire
when
they
heard
this
solution
of
migwan
problem
by
this
time
the
full
moon
was
climbing
over
the
top
of
the
hill
and
waking
up
the
sleeping
daisies
and
the
little
company
rose
reluctantly
and
wandered
back
to
the
automobiles
that
stood
by
the
roadside
looking
back
at
the
peaceful
hillside
they
had
just
left
it
seemed
that
the
nodding
daisies
and
the
murmuring
brook
and
the
rustling
grasses
all
echoed
the
song
the
girls
had
sung
around
the
fire
just
before
the
council
came
to
a
close
darkness
behind
us
peace
around
us
joy
before
us
light
o
light
