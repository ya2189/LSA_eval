a
little
pilgrim
by
margaret
o
wilson
oliphant
a
little
pilgrim
i
in
the
unseen
she
had
been
talking
of
dying
only
the
evening
before
with
a
friend
and
had
described
her
own
sensations
after
a
long
illness
when
she
had
been
at
the
point
of
death
i
suppose
she
said
that
i
was
as
nearly
gone
as
any
one
ever
was
to
come
back
again
there
was
no
pain
in
it
only
a
sense
of
sinking
down
down
through
the
bed
as
if
nothing
could
hold
me
or
give
me
support
enough
but
no
pain
and
then
they
had
spoken
of
another
friend
in
the
same
circumstances
who
also
had
come
back
from
the
very
verge
and
who
described
her
sensations
as
those
of
one
floating
upon
a
summer
sea
without
pain
or
suffering
in
a
lovely
nook
of
the
mediterranean
blue
as
the
sky
these
soft
and
soothing
images
of
the
passage
which
all
men
dread
had
been
talked
over
with
low
voices
yet
with
smiles
and
a
grateful
sense
that
the
warm
precincts
of
the
cheerful
day
were
once
more
familiar
to
both
and
very
cheerfully
she
went
to
rest
that
night
talking
of
what
was
to
be
done
on
the
morrow
and
fell
asleep
sweetly
in
her
little
room
with
its
shaded
light
and
curtained
window
and
little
pictures
on
the
dim
walls
all
was
quiet
in
the
house
soft
breathing
of
the
sleepers
soft
murmuring
of
the
spring
wind
outside
a
wintry
moon
very
clear
and
full
in
the
skies
a
little
town
all
hushed
and
quiet
everything
lying
defenceless
unconscious
in
the
safe
keeping
of
god
how
soon
she
woke
no
one
can
tell
she
woke
and
lay
quite
still
half
roused
half
hushed
in
that
soft
languor
that
attends
a
happy
waking
she
was
happy
always
in
the
peace
of
a
heart
that
was
humble
and
faithful
and
pure
but
yet
had
been
used
to
wake
to
a
consciousness
of
little
pains
and
troubles
such
as
even
to
her
meekness
were
sometimes
hard
to
bear
but
on
this
morning
there
were
none
of
these
she
lay
in
a
kind
of
hush
of
happiness
and
ease
not
caring
to
make
any
further
movement
lingering
over
the
sweet
sensation
of
that
waking
she
had
no
desire
to
move
nor
to
break
the
spell
of
the
silence
and
peace
it
was
still
very
early
she
supposed
and
probably
it
might
be
hours
yet
before
any
one
came
to
call
her
it
might
even
be
that
she
should
sleep
again
she
had
no
wish
to
move
she
lay
at
such
luxurious
ease
and
calm
but
by
and
by
as
she
came
to
full
possession
of
her
waking
senses
it
appeared
to
her
that
there
was
some
change
in
the
atmosphere
in
the
scene
there
began
to
steal
into
the
air
about
her
the
soft
dawn
as
of
a
summer
morning
the
lovely
blueness
of
the
first
opening
of
daylight
before
the
sun
it
could
not
be
the
light
of
the
moon
which
she
had
seen
before
she
went
to
bed
and
all
was
so
still
that
it
could
not
be
the
bustling
wintry
day
which
comes
at
that
time
of
the
year
late
to
find
the
world
awake
before
it
this
was
different
it
was
like
the
summer
dawn
a
soft
suffusion
of
light
growing
every
moment
and
by
and
by
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
not
in
the
little
room
where
she
had
lain
down
there
were
no
dim
walls
or
roof
her
little
pictures
were
all
gone
the
curtains
at
her
window
the
discovery
gave
her
no
uneasiness
in
that
delightful
calm
she
lay
still
to
think
of
it
all
to
wonder
yet
undisturbed
it
half
amused
her
that
these
things
should
be
changed
but
did
not
rouse
her
yet
with
any
shock
of
alteration
the
light
grew
fuller
and
fuller
round
growing
into
day
clearing
her
eyes
from
the
sweet
mist
of
the
first
waking
then
she
raised
herself
upon
her
arm
she
was
not
in
her
room
she
was
in
no
scene
she
knew
indeed
it
was
scarcely
a
scene
at
all
nothing
but
light
so
soft
and
lovely
that
it
soothed
and
caressed
her
eyes
she
thought
all
at
once
of
a
summer
morning
when
she
was
a
child
when
she
had
woke
in
the
deep
night
which
yet
was
day
early
so
early
that
the
birds
were
scarcely
astir
and
had
risen
up
with
a
delicious
sense
of
daring
and
of
being
all
alone
in
the
mystery
of
the
sunrise
in
the
unawakened
world
which
lay
at
her
feet
to
be
explored
as
if
she
were
eve
just
entering
upon
eden
it
was
curious
how
all
those
childish
sensations
long
forgotten
came
back
to
her
as
she
found
herself
so
unexpectedly
out
of
her
sleep
in
the
open
air
and
light
in
the
recollection
of
that
lovely
hour
with
a
smile
at
herself
so
different
as
she
now
knew
herself
to
be
she
was
moved
to
rise
and
look
a
little
more
closely
about
her
and
see
where
she
was
when
i
call
her
a
little
pilgrim
i
do
not
mean
that
she
was
a
child
on
the
contrary
she
was
not
even
young
she
was
little
by
nature
with
as
little
flesh
and
blood
as
was
consistent
with
mortal
life
and
she
was
one
of
those
who
are
always
little
for
love
the
tongue
found
diminutives
for
her
the
heart
kept
her
in
a
perpetual
youth
she
was
so
modest
and
so
gentle
that
she
always
came
last
so
long
as
there
was
any
one
whom
she
could
put
before
her
but
this
little
body
and
the
soul
which
was
not
little
and
the
heart
which
was
big
and
great
had
known
all
the
round
of
sorrows
that
fill
a
woman
life
without
knowing
any
of
its
warmer
blessings
she
had
nursed
the
sick
she
had
entertained
the
weary
she
had
consoled
the
dying
she
had
gone
about
the
world
which
had
no
prize
or
recompense
for
her
with
a
smile
her
little
presence
had
been
always
bright
she
was
not
clever
you
might
have
said
she
had
no
mind
at
all
but
so
wise
and
right
and
tender
a
heart
that
it
was
as
good
as
genius
this
is
to
let
you
know
what
this
little
pilgrim
had
been
she
rose
up
and
it
was
strange
how
like
she
felt
to
the
child
she
remembered
in
that
still
summer
morning
so
many
years
ago
her
little
body
which
had
been
worn
and
racked
with
pain
felt
as
light
and
unconscious
of
itself
as
then
she
took
her
first
step
forward
with
the
same
sense
of
pleasure
yet
of
awe
suppressed
delight
and
daring
and
wild
adventure
yet
perfect
safety
but
then
the
recollection
of
the
little
room
in
which
she
had
fallen
asleep
came
quickly
strangely
over
her
confusing
her
mind
i
must
be
dreaming
i
suppose
she
said
to
herself
regretfully
for
it
was
all
so
sweet
that
she
wished
it
to
be
true
her
movement
called
her
attention
to
herself
and
she
found
that
she
was
dressed
not
in
her
as
she
had
lain
down
but
in
a
dress
she
did
not
know
she
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
at
it
and
wonder
she
had
never
seen
it
before
she
did
not
make
out
how
it
was
made
or
what
stuff
it
was
but
it
fell
so
pleasantly
about
her
it
was
so
soft
and
light
that
in
her
confused
state
she
abandoned
that
subject
with
only
an
additional
sense
of
pleasure
and
now
the
atmosphere
became
more
distinct
to
her
she
saw
that
under
her
feet
was
a
greenness
as
of
close
velvet
turf
both
cool
and
warm
cool
and
soft
to
touch
but
with
no
damp
in
it
as
might
have
been
at
that
early
hour
and
with
flowers
showing
here
and
there
she
stood
looking
round
her
not
able
to
identify
the
landscape
because
she
was
still
confused
a
little
and
then
walked
softly
on
all
the
time
afraid
lest
she
should
awake
and
lose
the
sweetness
of
it
all
and
the
sense
of
rest
and
happiness
she
felt
so
light
so
airy
as
if
she
could
skim
across
the
field
like
any
child
it
was
bliss
enough
to
breathe
and
move
with
every
organ
so
free
after
more
than
fifty
years
of
hard
service
in
the
world
to
feel
like
this
even
in
a
dream
she
smiled
to
herself
at
her
own
pleasure
and
then
once
more
yet
more
potently
there
came
back
upon
her
the
appearance
of
her
room
in
which
she
had
fallen
asleep
how
had
she
got
from
there
to
here
had
she
been
carried
away
in
her
sleep
or
was
it
only
a
dream
and
would
she
by
and
by
find
herself
between
the
four
dim
walls
again
then
this
shadow
of
recollection
faded
away
once
more
and
she
moved
forward
walking
in
a
soft
rapture
over
the
delicious
turf
presently
she
came
to
a
little
mound
upon
which
she
paused
to
look
about
her
every
moment
she
saw
a
little
farther
blue
hills
far
away
extending
in
long
sweet
distance
an
indefinite
landscape
but
fair
and
vast
so
that
there
could
be
seen
no
end
to
it
not
even
the
line
of
the
horizon
save
at
one
side
where
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
shadowy
gateway
and
something
dim
beyond
she
turned
from
the
brightness
to
look
at
this
and
when
she
had
looked
for
some
time
she
saw
what
pleased
her
still
more
though
she
had
been
so
happy
before
people
coming
in
they
were
too
far
off
for
her
to
see
clearly
but
many
came
each
apart
one
figure
only
at
a
time
to
watch
them
amused
her
in
the
delightful
leisure
of
her
mind
who
were
they
she
wondered
but
no
doubt
soon
some
of
them
would
come
this
way
and
she
would
see
then
suddenly
she
seemed
to
hear
as
if
in
answer
to
her
question
some
one
say
those
who
are
coming
in
are
the
people
who
have
died
on
earth
died
she
said
to
herself
aloud
with
a
wondering
sense
of
the
inappropriateness
of
the
word
which
almost
came
the
length
of
laughter
in
this
sweet
air
with
such
a
sense
of
life
about
to
suggest
such
an
idea
was
almost
ludicrous
she
was
so
occupied
with
this
that
she
did
not
look
round
to
see
who
the
speaker
might
be
she
thought
it
over
amused
but
with
some
new
confusion
of
the
mind
then
she
said
perhaps
i
have
died
too
with
a
laugh
to
herself
at
the
absurdity
of
the
thought
yes
said
the
other
voice
echoing
that
gentle
laugh
of
hers
you
have
died
too
she
turned
round
and
saw
another
standing
by
her
a
woman
younger
and
fairer
and
more
stately
than
herself
but
of
so
sweet
a
countenance
that
our
little
pilgrim
felt
no
shyness
but
recognized
a
friend
at
once
she
was
more
occupied
looking
at
this
new
face
and
feeling
herself
at
once
so
much
happier
though
she
had
been
so
happy
before
in
finding
a
companion
who
would
tell
her
what
everything
was
than
in
considering
what
these
words
might
mean
but
just
then
once
more
the
recollection
of
the
four
walls
with
their
little
pictures
hanging
and
the
window
with
its
curtains
drawn
seemed
to
come
round
her
for
a
moment
so
that
her
whole
soul
was
in
a
confusion
and
as
this
vision
slowly
faded
away
though
she
could
not
tell
which
was
the
vision
the
darkened
room
or
this
lovely
light
her
attention
came
back
to
the
words
at
which
she
had
laughed
and
at
which
the
other
had
laughed
as
she
repeated
them
died
was
it
possible
that
this
could
be
the
meaning
of
it
all
died
she
said
looking
with
wonder
in
her
companion
face
which
smiled
back
to
her
but
do
you
mean
you
can
not
mean
i
have
never
been
so
well
i
am
so
strong
i
have
no
trouble
anywhere
i
am
full
of
life
the
other
nodded
her
beautiful
head
with
a
more
beautiful
smile
and
the
little
pilgrim
burst
out
in
a
great
cry
of
joy
and
said
is
this
all
is
it
over
is
it
all
over
is
it
possible
that
this
can
be
all
were
you
afraid
of
it
the
other
said
there
was
a
little
agitation
for
the
moment
in
her
heart
she
was
so
glad
so
relieved
and
thankful
that
it
took
away
her
breath
she
could
not
get
over
the
wonder
of
it
to
think
one
should
look
forward
to
it
so
long
and
wonder
and
be
even
unhappy
trying
to
divine
what
it
will
be
and
this
all
ah
but
the
angel
was
very
gentle
with
you
said
the
young
woman
you
were
so
tender
and
worn
that
he
only
smiled
and
took
you
sleeping
there
are
other
ways
but
it
is
always
wonderful
to
think
it
is
over
as
you
say
the
little
pilgrim
could
do
nothing
but
talk
of
it
as
one
does
after
a
very
great
event
are
you
sure
quite
sure
it
is
so
she
said
it
would
be
dreadful
to
find
it
only
a
dream
to
go
to
sleep
again
and
wake
up
there
this
thought
troubled
her
for
a
moment
the
vision
of
the
bedchamber
came
back
but
this
time
she
felt
it
was
only
a
vision
were
you
afraid
too
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
never
thought
of
it
at
all
the
beautiful
stranger
said
i
did
not
think
it
would
come
to
me
but
i
was
very
sorry
for
the
others
to
whom
it
came
and
grudged
that
they
should
lose
the
beautiful
earth
and
life
and
all
that
was
so
sweet
my
dear
cried
the
pilgrim
as
if
she
had
never
died
oh
but
this
is
far
sweeter
and
the
heart
is
so
light
and
it
is
happiness
only
to
breathe
is
it
heaven
here
it
must
be
heaven
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
heaven
we
have
so
many
things
to
learn
they
can
not
tell
you
every
thing
at
once
said
the
beautiful
lady
i
have
seen
some
of
the
people
i
was
sorry
for
and
when
i
told
them
we
laughed
as
you
and
i
laughed
just
now
for
pleasure
that
makes
me
think
said
the
little
pilgrim
if
i
have
died
as
you
say
which
is
so
strange
and
me
so
living
if
i
have
died
they
will
have
found
it
out
the
house
will
be
all
dark
and
they
will
be
breaking
their
hearts
oh
how
could
i
forget
them
in
my
selfishness
and
be
happy
i
so
while
they
she
sat
down
hastily
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
wept
the
other
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
then
kissed
her
for
comfort
and
cried
too
the
two
happy
creatures
sat
there
weeping
together
thinking
of
those
they
had
left
behind
with
an
exquisite
grief
which
was
not
unhappiness
which
was
sweet
with
love
and
pity
and
oh
said
the
little
pilgrim
what
can
we
do
to
tell
them
not
to
grieve
can
not
you
send
can
not
you
speak
can
not
one
go
to
tell
them
the
heavenly
stranger
shook
her
head
it
is
not
well
they
all
say
sometimes
one
has
been
permitted
but
they
do
not
know
you
she
said
with
a
pitiful
look
in
her
sweet
eyes
my
mother
told
me
that
her
heart
was
so
sick
for
me
she
was
allowed
to
go
and
she
went
and
stood
by
me
and
spoke
to
me
and
i
did
not
know
her
she
came
back
so
sad
and
sorry
that
they
took
her
at
once
to
our
father
and
there
you
know
she
found
that
it
was
all
well
all
is
well
when
you
are
there
ah
said
the
little
pilgrim
i
have
been
thinking
of
other
things
of
how
happy
i
was
and
of
but
never
of
the
father
just
as
if
i
had
not
died
the
other
smiled
upon
her
with
a
wonderful
smile
do
you
think
he
will
be
offended
our
father
as
if
he
were
one
of
us
she
said
and
then
the
little
pilgrim
in
her
sudden
grief
to
have
forgotten
him
became
conscious
of
a
new
rapture
unexplainable
in
words
she
felt
his
understanding
to
envelop
her
little
spirit
with
a
soft
and
clear
penetration
and
that
nothing
she
did
or
said
could
ever
be
misconceived
more
will
you
take
me
to
him
she
said
trembling
yet
glad
clasping
her
hands
and
once
again
the
other
shook
her
head
they
will
take
us
both
when
it
is
time
she
said
we
do
not
go
at
our
own
will
but
i
have
seen
our
brother
oh
take
me
to
him
the
little
pilgrim
cried
let
me
see
his
face
i
have
so
many
things
to
say
to
him
i
want
to
ask
him
oh
take
me
to
where
i
can
see
his
face
and
then
once
again
the
heavenly
lady
smiled
i
have
seen
him
she
said
he
is
always
about
now
here
now
there
he
will
come
and
see
you
perhaps
when
you
are
not
thinking
but
when
he
pleases
we
do
not
think
here
of
what
we
will
the
little
pilgrim
sat
very
still
wondering
at
all
this
she
had
thought
when
a
soul
left
the
earth
that
it
went
at
once
to
god
and
thought
of
nothing
more
except
worship
and
singing
of
praises
but
this
was
different
from
her
thoughts
she
sat
and
pondered
and
wondered
she
was
baffled
at
many
points
she
was
not
changed
as
she
expected
but
so
much
like
herself
still
still
perplexed
and
feeling
herself
foolish
not
understanding
toiling
after
a
something
which
she
could
not
grasp
the
only
difference
was
that
it
was
no
trouble
to
her
now
she
smiled
at
herself
and
at
her
dullness
feeling
sure
that
by
and
by
she
would
understand
and
do
you
wonder
too
she
said
to
her
companion
which
was
a
speech
such
as
she
used
to
make
upon
the
earth
when
people
thought
her
little
remarks
disjointed
and
did
not
always
see
the
connection
of
them
but
her
friend
of
heaven
knew
what
she
meant
i
do
nothing
but
wonder
she
said
for
it
is
all
so
natural
not
what
we
thought
is
it
long
since
you
have
been
here
the
pilgrim
said
i
came
before
you
but
how
long
or
how
short
i
can
not
tell
for
that
is
not
how
we
count
we
count
only
by
what
happens
to
us
and
nothing
yet
has
happened
to
me
except
that
i
have
seen
our
brother
my
mother
sees
him
always
that
means
she
has
lived
here
a
long
time
and
well
is
it
possible
to
live
ill
in
heaven
the
little
pilgrim
eyes
grew
large
as
if
they
were
going
to
have
tears
in
them
and
a
little
shadow
seemed
to
come
over
her
but
the
other
laughed
softly
and
restored
all
her
confidence
i
have
told
you
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
heaven
or
not
no
one
does
ill
but
some
do
little
and
some
do
much
just
as
it
used
to
be
do
you
remember
in
dante
there
was
a
lazy
spirit
that
stayed
about
the
gates
and
never
got
farther
but
perhaps
you
never
read
that
i
was
not
clever
said
the
little
pilgrim
wistfully
no
i
never
read
it
i
wish
i
had
known
more
upon
which
the
beautiful
lady
kissed
her
again
to
give
her
courage
and
said
it
does
not
matter
at
all
it
all
comes
to
you
whether
you
have
known
it
or
not
then
your
mother
came
here
long
ago
said
the
pilgrim
ah
then
i
shall
see
my
mother
too
oh
very
soon
as
soon
as
she
can
come
but
there
are
so
many
things
to
do
sometimes
we
can
go
and
meet
those
who
are
coming
but
it
is
not
always
so
i
remember
that
she
had
a
message
she
could
not
leave
her
business
you
may
be
sure
or
she
would
have
been
here
then
you
know
my
mother
oh
and
my
dearest
father
too
we
all
know
each
other
the
lady
said
with
a
smile
and
you
did
you
come
to
meet
me
only
out
of
kindness
though
i
do
not
know
you
the
little
pilgrim
said
i
am
nothing
but
an
idler
said
the
beautiful
lady
making
acquaintance
i
am
of
little
use
as
yet
i
was
very
hard
worked
before
i
came
here
and
they
think
it
well
that
we
should
sit
in
the
sun
and
take
a
little
rest
and
find
things
out
then
the
little
pilgrim
sat
still
and
mused
and
felt
in
her
heart
that
she
had
found
many
things
out
what
she
had
heard
had
been
wonderful
and
it
was
more
wonderful
still
to
be
sitting
here
all
alone
save
for
this
lady
yet
so
happy
and
at
ease
she
wanted
to
sing
she
was
so
happy
but
remembered
that
she
was
old
and
had
lost
her
voice
and
then
remembered
again
that
she
was
no
longer
old
and
perhaps
had
found
it
again
and
then
it
occurred
to
her
to
remember
how
she
had
learned
to
sing
and
how
beautiful
her
sister
voice
was
and
how
heavenly
to
hear
her
which
made
her
remember
that
this
dear
sister
would
be
weeping
not
singing
down
where
she
had
come
from
and
immediately
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
oh
she
said
i
never
thought
we
should
cry
when
we
came
here
i
thought
there
were
no
tears
in
heaven
did
you
think
then
that
we
were
all
turned
into
stone
cried
the
beautiful
lady
it
says
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
our
faces
which
is
not
like
saying
there
are
to
be
no
tears
upon
which
the
little
pilgrim
glad
that
it
was
permitted
to
be
sorry
though
she
was
so
happy
allowed
herself
to
think
upon
the
place
she
had
so
lately
left
and
she
seemed
to
see
her
little
room
again
with
all
the
pictures
hanging
as
she
had
left
them
and
the
house
darkened
and
the
dear
faces
she
knew
all
sad
and
troubled
and
to
hear
them
saying
over
to
each
other
all
the
little
careless
words
she
had
said
as
if
they
were
out
of
the
scriptures
and
crying
if
any
one
but
mentioned
her
name
and
putting
on
crape
and
black
dresses
and
lamenting
as
if
that
which
had
happened
was
something
very
terrible
she
cried
at
this
and
yet
felt
half
inclined
to
laugh
but
would
not
because
it
would
be
disrespectful
to
those
she
loved
one
thing
did
not
occur
to
her
and
that
was
that
they
would
be
carrying
her
body
which
she
had
left
behind
her
away
to
the
grave
she
did
not
think
of
this
because
she
was
not
aware
of
the
loss
and
felt
far
too
much
herself
to
think
that
there
was
another
part
of
her
being
buried
in
the
ground
from
this
she
was
aroused
by
her
companion
asking
her
a
question
have
you
left
many
there
she
said
no
one
said
the
little
pilgrim
to
whom
i
was
the
first
on
earth
but
they
loved
me
all
the
same
and
if
i
could
only
only
let
them
know
but
i
left
one
to
whom
i
was
the
first
on
earth
said
the
other
with
tears
in
her
beautiful
eyes
and
oh
how
glad
i
should
be
to
be
less
happy
if
he
might
be
less
sad
and
you
can
not
go
you
can
not
go
to
him
and
tell
him
oh
i
wish
cried
the
little
pilgrim
but
then
she
paused
for
the
wish
died
all
away
in
her
heart
into
a
tender
love
for
this
poor
sorrowful
man
whom
she
did
not
know
this
gave
her
the
sweetest
pang
she
had
ever
felt
for
she
knew
that
all
was
well
and
yet
was
so
sorry
and
would
have
willingly
given
up
her
happiness
for
his
all
this
the
lady
read
in
her
eyes
or
her
heart
and
loved
her
for
it
and
they
took
hands
and
were
silent
together
thinking
of
those
they
had
left
as
we
upon
earth
think
of
those
who
have
gone
from
us
but
only
with
far
more
understanding
and
far
greater
love
and
have
you
never
been
able
to
do
anything
for
him
our
pilgrim
said
then
the
beautiful
lady
face
flushed
all
over
with
the
most
heavenly
warmth
and
light
her
smile
ran
over
like
the
bursting
out
of
the
sun
oh
i
will
tell
you
she
said
there
was
a
moment
when
he
was
very
sad
and
perplexed
not
knowing
what
to
think
there
was
something
he
could
not
understand
nor
could
i
understand
nor
did
i
know
what
it
was
until
it
was
said
to
me
may
go
and
tell
him
and
i
went
in
the
early
morning
before
he
was
awake
and
kissed
him
and
said
it
in
his
ear
he
woke
up
in
a
moment
and
understood
and
everything
was
clear
to
him
afterward
i
heard
him
say
is
true
that
the
night
brings
counsel
i
had
been
troubled
and
distressed
all
day
long
but
in
the
morning
it
was
quite
clear
to
me
and
the
other
answered
brain
was
refreshed
and
that
made
your
judgment
clear
but
they
never
knew
it
was
i
that
was
a
great
delight
the
dear
souls
they
are
so
foolish
she
cried
with
the
sweetest
laughter
that
ran
into
tears
one
cries
because
one
is
so
happy
it
is
just
a
silly
old
habit
she
said
and
you
were
not
grieved
it
did
not
hurt
you
that
he
did
not
know
oh
not
then
not
then
i
did
not
go
to
him
for
that
when
you
have
been
here
a
little
longer
you
will
see
the
difference
when
you
go
for
yourself
out
of
impatience
because
it
still
seems
to
you
that
you
must
know
best
and
they
do
know
you
then
it
strikes
to
your
heart
but
when
you
go
to
help
them
ah
she
cried
when
he
comes
how
much
i
shall
have
to
tell
him
thought
it
was
sleep
when
it
was
i
when
you
woke
so
fresh
and
clear
it
was
i
that
kissed
you
you
thought
it
your
duty
to
me
to
be
sad
afterward
and
were
angry
with
yourself
because
you
had
wronged
me
of
the
first
thoughts
of
your
waking
when
it
was
all
me
all
through
i
begin
to
understand
said
the
little
pilgrim
but
why
should
they
not
see
us
and
why
should
not
we
tell
them
it
would
seem
so
natural
if
they
saw
us
it
would
make
them
so
happy
and
so
sure
upon
this
the
lady
shook
her
head
the
worst
of
it
is
not
that
they
are
not
sure
it
is
the
parting
if
this
makes
us
sorry
here
how
can
they
escape
the
sorrow
of
it
even
if
they
saw
us
for
we
must
be
parted
we
can
not
go
back
to
live
with
them
or
why
should
we
have
died
and
then
we
must
all
live
our
lives
they
in
their
way
we
in
ours
we
must
not
weigh
them
down
but
only
help
them
when
it
is
seen
that
there
is
need
for
it
all
this
we
shall
know
better
by
and
by
you
make
it
so
clear
and
your
face
is
so
bright
said
our
little
pilgrim
gratefully
you
must
have
known
a
great
deal
and
understood
even
when
you
were
in
the
world
i
was
as
foolish
as
i
could
be
said
the
other
with
her
laugh
that
was
as
sweet
as
music
yet
thought
i
knew
and
they
thought
i
knew
but
all
that
does
not
matter
now
i
think
it
matters
for
look
how
much
you
have
showed
me
but
tell
me
one
thing
more
how
was
it
said
to
you
that
you
must
go
and
tell
him
was
it
some
one
who
spoke
was
it
her
face
grew
so
bright
that
all
the
past
brightness
was
as
a
dull
sky
to
this
it
gave
out
such
a
light
of
happiness
that
the
little
pilgrim
was
dazzled
i
was
wandering
about
she
said
to
see
this
new
place
my
mother
had
come
back
between
two
errands
she
had
and
had
come
to
see
me
and
tell
me
everything
and
i
was
straying
about
wondering
what
i
was
to
do
when
suddenly
i
saw
some
one
coming
along
as
it
might
be
now
she
paused
and
looked
up
and
the
little
pilgrim
looked
up
too
with
her
heart
beating
but
there
was
no
one
then
she
gave
a
little
sigh
and
turned
and
listened
again
i
had
not
been
looking
for
him
or
thinking
you
know
my
mind
is
too
light
i
am
pleased
with
whatever
is
before
me
and
i
was
so
curious
for
my
mother
had
told
me
many
things
when
suddenly
i
caught
sight
of
him
passing
by
he
was
going
on
and
when
i
saw
this
a
panic
seized
me
lest
he
should
pass
and
say
nothing
i
do
not
know
what
i
did
i
flung
myself
upon
his
robe
and
got
hold
of
it
or
at
least
i
think
so
i
was
in
such
an
agony
lest
he
should
pass
and
never
notice
me
but
that
was
my
folly
he
pass
as
if
that
could
be
and
what
did
he
say
to
you
cried
the
little
pilgrim
her
heart
almost
aching
it
beat
so
high
with
sympathy
and
expectation
the
lady
looked
at
her
for
a
little
without
saying
anything
i
can
not
tell
you
she
said
any
more
than
i
can
tell
if
this
is
heaven
it
is
a
mystery
when
you
see
him
you
will
know
it
will
be
all
you
have
ever
hoped
for
and
more
besides
for
he
understands
everything
he
knows
what
is
in
our
hearts
about
those
we
have
left
and
why
he
sent
for
us
before
them
there
is
no
need
to
tell
him
anything
he
knows
he
will
come
when
it
is
time
and
after
you
have
seen
him
you
will
know
what
to
do
then
the
beautiful
lady
turned
her
eyes
toward
the
gate
and
while
the
little
pilgrim
was
still
gazing
disappeared
from
her
and
went
to
comfort
some
other
stranger
they
were
dear
friends
always
and
met
often
but
not
again
in
the
same
way
when
she
was
thus
left
alone
again
the
little
pilgrim
sat
still
upon
the
grassy
mound
quite
tranquil
and
happy
without
wishing
to
move
there
was
such
a
sense
of
in
her
that
she
liked
to
sit
there
and
look
about
her
and
breathe
the
delightful
air
like
the
air
of
a
summer
morning
without
wishing
for
anything
how
idle
i
am
she
said
to
herself
in
the
very
words
she
had
often
used
before
she
died
but
then
she
was
idle
from
weakness
and
now
from
happiness
she
wanted
for
nothing
to
be
alive
was
so
sweet
there
was
a
great
deal
to
think
about
in
what
she
had
heard
but
she
did
not
even
think
about
that
only
resigned
herself
to
the
delight
of
sitting
there
in
the
sweet
air
and
being
happy
many
people
were
coming
and
going
and
they
all
knew
her
and
smiled
upon
her
and
those
who
were
at
a
distance
would
wave
their
hands
this
did
not
surprise
her
at
all
for
though
she
was
a
stranger
she
too
felt
that
she
knew
them
all
but
that
they
should
be
so
kind
was
a
delight
to
her
which
words
could
not
tell
she
sat
and
mused
very
sweetly
about
all
that
had
been
told
her
and
wondered
whether
she
too
might
go
sometimes
and
with
a
kiss
and
a
whisper
clear
up
something
that
was
dark
in
the
mind
of
some
one
who
loved
her
i
that
never
was
clever
she
said
to
herself
with
a
smile
and
chiefly
she
thought
of
a
friend
whom
she
loved
who
was
often
in
great
perplexity
and
did
not
know
how
to
guide
herself
amid
the
difficulties
of
the
world
the
little
pilgrim
half
laughed
with
delight
and
then
half
cried
with
longing
to
go
as
the
beautiful
lady
had
done
and
make
something
clear
that
had
been
dark
before
to
this
friend
as
she
was
thinking
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
some
one
came
up
to
her
crossing
over
the
flowery
greenness
leaving
the
path
on
purpose
this
was
a
being
younger
than
the
lady
who
had
spoken
to
her
before
with
flowing
hair
all
crisped
with
touches
of
sunshine
and
a
dress
all
white
and
soft
like
the
feathers
of
a
white
dove
there
was
something
in
her
face
different
from
that
of
the
other
by
which
the
little
pilgrim
knew
somehow
without
knowing
how
that
she
had
come
here
as
a
child
and
grown
up
in
this
celestial
place
she
was
tall
and
fair
and
came
along
with
so
musical
a
motion
as
if
her
foot
scarcely
touched
the
ground
that
she
might
have
had
wings
and
the
little
pilgrim
indeed
was
not
sure
as
she
watched
whether
it
might
not
perhaps
be
an
angel
for
she
knew
that
there
were
angels
among
the
blessed
people
who
were
coming
and
going
about
but
had
not
been
able
yet
to
find
one
out
she
knew
that
this
was
coming
to
her
and
turned
towards
her
with
a
smile
and
a
throb
at
her
heart
of
expectation
but
when
the
heavenly
maiden
drew
nearer
her
face
though
it
was
so
fair
looked
to
the
pilgrim
like
another
face
which
she
had
known
very
well
indeed
like
the
homely
and
troubled
face
of
the
friend
of
whom
she
had
been
thinking
and
so
she
smiled
all
the
more
and
held
out
her
hands
and
said
i
am
sure
i
know
you
upon
which
the
other
kissed
her
and
said
we
all
know
each
other
but
i
have
seen
you
often
before
you
came
here
and
knelt
down
by
her
among
the
flowers
that
were
growing
just
in
front
of
some
tall
lilies
that
grew
over
her
and
made
a
lovely
canopy
over
her
head
there
was
something
in
her
face
that
was
like
a
child
her
mouth
so
soft
as
if
it
had
never
spoken
anything
but
heavenly
words
her
eyes
brown
and
golden
as
if
they
were
filled
with
light
she
took
the
little
pilgrim
hands
in
hers
and
held
them
and
smoothed
them
between
her
own
these
hands
had
been
very
thin
and
worn
before
but
now
when
the
pilgrim
looked
at
them
she
saw
that
they
became
softer
and
whiter
every
moment
with
the
touch
of
this
immortal
youth
i
knew
you
were
coming
said
the
maiden
when
my
mother
has
wanted
me
i
have
seen
you
there
and
you
were
thinking
of
her
now
that
was
how
i
found
you
do
you
know
then
what
one
thinks
said
the
little
pilgrim
with
wondering
eyes
it
is
in
the
air
and
when
it
concerns
us
it
comes
to
us
like
the
breeze
but
we
who
are
the
children
here
we
feel
it
more
quickly
than
you
are
you
a
child
said
the
little
pilgrim
or
are
you
an
angel
sometimes
you
are
like
a
child
but
then
your
face
shines
and
you
are
like
you
must
have
some
name
for
it
here
there
is
nothing
among
the
words
i
know
and
then
she
paused
a
little
still
looking
at
her
and
cried
oh
if
she
could
but
see
you
little
margaret
that
would
do
her
most
good
of
all
then
the
maiden
margaret
shook
her
lovely
head
what
does
her
most
good
is
the
will
of
the
father
she
said
at
this
the
little
pilgrim
felt
once
more
that
thrill
of
expectation
and
awe
oh
child
you
have
seen
him
she
cried
and
the
other
smiled
have
you
forgotten
who
they
are
that
always
behold
his
face
we
have
never
had
any
fear
or
trembling
we
are
not
angels
and
there
is
no
other
name
we
are
the
children
there
is
something
given
to
us
beyond
the
others
we
have
had
no
other
home
oh
tell
me
tell
me
the
little
pilgrim
cried
upon
this
margaret
kissed
her
putting
her
soft
cheek
against
hers
and
said
it
is
a
mystery
it
can
not
be
put
into
words
in
your
time
you
will
know
when
you
touch
me
you
change
me
and
i
grow
like
you
the
pilgrim
said
ah
if
she
could
see
us
together
you
and
me
and
will
you
go
to
her
soon
again
and
do
you
see
them
always
what
they
are
doing
and
take
care
of
them
it
is
our
father
who
takes
cares
of
them
and
our
lord
who
is
our
brother
i
do
his
errands
when
i
am
able
sometimes
he
will
let
me
go
sometimes
another
according
as
it
is
best
who
am
i
that
i
should
take
care
of
them
i
serve
them
when
i
may
but
you
do
not
forget
them
the
pilgrim
said
with
wistful
eyes
we
love
them
always
said
margaret
she
was
more
still
than
the
lady
who
had
first
spoken
with
the
pilgrim
her
countenance
was
full
of
a
heavenly
calm
it
had
never
known
passion
nor
anguish
sometimes
there
was
in
it
a
look
of
vision
sometimes
the
simplicity
of
a
child
but
what
are
we
in
comparison
for
he
loves
them
more
than
we
do
when
he
keeps
us
from
them
it
is
for
love
we
must
each
live
our
own
life
but
it
is
hard
for
them
sometimes
said
the
little
pilgrim
who
could
not
withdraw
her
thoughts
from
those
she
had
left
they
are
never
forsaken
said
the
angel
maiden
but
oh
there
are
worse
things
than
sorrow
the
little
pilgrim
said
there
is
wrong
there
is
evil
margaret
will
not
he
send
you
to
step
in
before
them
to
save
them
from
wrong
it
is
not
for
us
to
judge
said
the
young
margaret
with
eyes
full
of
heavenly
wisdom
our
brother
has
it
all
in
his
hand
we
do
not
read
their
hearts
like
him
sometimes
you
are
permitted
to
see
the
battle
the
little
pilgrim
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
i
could
not
i
could
not
unless
i
knew
they
were
to
win
the
day
they
will
win
the
day
in
the
end
but
sometimes
when
it
was
being
lost
i
have
seen
in
his
face
a
something
i
can
not
tell
more
love
than
before
something
that
seemed
to
say
child
my
child
would
that
i
could
do
it
for
thee
my
child
oh
that
is
what
i
have
always
felt
cried
the
pilgrim
clasping
her
hands
her
eyes
were
dim
her
heart
for
a
moment
almost
forgot
its
blessedness
but
he
could
oh
little
margaret
he
could
you
have
forgotten
if
thou
wilt
thou
canst
the
child
of
heaven
looked
at
her
mutely
with
sweet
grave
eyes
in
which
there
was
much
that
confused
her
who
was
a
stranger
here
and
once
more
softly
shook
her
head
is
it
that
he
will
not
then
said
the
other
with
a
low
voice
of
awe
our
lord
who
died
he
listen
said
the
other
i
hear
his
step
on
the
way
the
little
pilgrim
rose
up
from
the
mound
on
which
she
was
sitting
her
soul
was
confused
with
wonder
and
fear
she
had
thought
that
an
angel
might
step
between
a
soul
on
earth
and
sin
and
that
if
one
but
prayed
and
prayed
the
dear
lord
would
stand
between
and
deliver
the
tempted
she
had
meant
when
she
saw
his
face
to
ask
him
to
save
was
not
he
born
did
not
he
live
and
die
to
save
the
angel
maiden
looked
at
her
all
the
while
with
eyes
that
understood
all
her
perplexity
and
her
doubt
but
spoke
not
thus
it
was
that
before
the
lord
came
to
her
the
sweetness
of
her
first
blessedness
was
obscured
and
she
found
that
here
too
even
here
though
in
a
moment
she
should
see
him
there
was
need
for
faith
young
margaret
who
had
been
kneeling
by
her
rose
up
too
and
stood
among
the
lilies
waiting
her
soft
countenance
shining
her
eyes
turned
towards
him
who
was
coming
upon
her
there
was
no
cloud
nor
doubt
she
was
one
of
the
children
of
that
land
familiar
with
his
presence
and
in
the
air
there
was
a
sound
such
as
those
who
hear
it
alone
can
describe
a
sound
as
of
help
coming
and
safety
like
the
sound
of
a
deliverer
when
one
is
in
deadly
danger
like
the
sound
of
a
conqueror
like
the
step
of
the
dearest
beloved
coming
home
as
it
came
nearer
the
fear
melted
away
out
of
the
beating
heart
of
the
pilgrim
who
could
fear
so
near
him
her
breath
went
away
from
her
her
heart
out
of
her
bosom
to
meet
his
coming
oh
never
fear
could
live
where
he
was
her
soul
was
all
confused
but
it
was
with
hope
and
joy
she
held
out
her
hands
in
that
amaze
and
dropped
upon
her
knees
not
knowing
what
she
did
he
was
going
about
his
father
business
not
lingering
yet
neither
making
haste
and
the
calm
and
peace
which
the
little
pilgrim
had
seen
in
the
faces
of
the
blessed
were
but
reflections
from
the
majestic
gentleness
of
the
countenance
to
which
all
quivering
with
happiness
and
wonder
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
many
things
there
had
been
in
her
mind
to
say
to
him
she
wanted
to
ask
for
those
she
loved
some
things
which
perhaps
he
had
overlooked
she
wanted
to
say
send
me
it
seemed
to
her
that
here
was
the
occasion
she
had
longed
for
all
her
life
oh
how
many
times
had
she
wished
to
be
able
to
go
to
him
to
fall
at
his
feet
to
show
him
something
which
had
been
left
undone
something
which
perhaps
for
her
asking
he
would
remember
to
do
but
when
this
dream
of
her
life
was
fulfilled
and
the
little
pilgrim
kneeling
and
all
shaken
and
trembling
with
devotion
and
joy
was
at
his
feet
lifting
her
face
to
him
seeing
him
hearing
him
then
she
said
nothing
to
him
at
all
she
no
longer
wanted
to
say
anything
or
wanted
anything
except
what
he
chose
or
had
power
to
think
of
anything
except
that
all
was
well
and
everything
everything
as
it
should
be
in
his
hand
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
that
she
had
ever
hoped
for
was
fulfilled
when
she
met
the
look
in
his
eyes
at
first
it
seemed
too
bright
for
her
to
meet
but
next
moment
she
knew
it
was
all
that
was
needed
to
light
up
the
world
and
in
it
everything
was
clear
her
trembling
ceased
her
little
frame
grew
inspired
though
she
still
knelt
her
head
rose
erect
drawn
to
him
like
the
flower
to
the
sun
she
could
not
tell
how
long
it
was
nor
what
was
said
nor
if
it
was
in
words
all
that
she
knew
was
that
she
told
him
all
that
ever
she
had
thought
or
wished
or
intended
in
all
her
life
although
she
said
nothing
at
all
and
that
he
opened
all
things
to
her
and
showed
her
that
everything
was
well
and
no
one
forgotten
and
that
the
things
she
would
have
told
him
of
were
more
near
his
heart
than
hers
and
those
to
whom
she
wanted
to
be
sent
were
in
his
own
hand
but
whether
this
passed
with
words
or
without
words
she
could
not
tell
her
soul
expanded
under
his
eyes
like
a
flower
it
opened
out
it
comprehended
and
felt
and
knew
she
smote
her
hands
together
in
her
wonder
that
she
could
have
missed
seeing
what
was
so
clear
and
laughed
with
a
sweet
scorn
at
her
folly
as
two
people
who
love
each
other
laugh
at
the
little
misunderstanding
that
has
parted
them
she
was
bold
with
him
though
she
was
so
timid
by
nature
and
ventured
to
laugh
at
herself
not
to
reproach
herself
for
his
divine
eyes
spoke
no
blame
but
smiled
upon
her
folly
too
and
then
he
laid
a
hand
upon
her
head
which
seemed
to
fill
her
with
currents
of
strength
and
joy
running
through
all
her
veins
and
then
she
seemed
to
come
to
herself
saying
loud
out
and
that
i
will
and
that
i
will
and
lo
she
was
kneeling
on
the
warm
soft
sod
alone
and
hearing
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
as
he
went
about
his
father
business
filling
all
the
air
with
echoes
of
blessing
and
all
the
people
who
were
coming
and
going
smiled
upon
her
and
she
knew
they
were
all
glad
for
her
that
she
had
seen
him
and
got
the
desire
of
her
heart
some
of
them
waved
their
hands
as
they
passed
and
some
paused
a
moment
and
spoke
to
her
with
tender
congratulations
they
seemed
to
have
the
tears
in
their
eyes
for
joy
remembering
every
one
the
first
time
they
had
themselves
seen
him
and
the
joy
of
it
so
that
all
about
there
sounded
a
concord
of
happy
thoughts
all
echoing
to
each
other
she
has
seen
the
lord
why
did
she
say
and
that
i
will
and
that
i
will
with
such
fervor
and
delight
she
could
not
have
told
but
yet
she
knew
the
first
thing
was
that
she
had
yet
to
wait
and
believe
until
all
things
should
be
accomplished
neither
doubting
nor
fearing
but
knowing
that
all
should
be
well
and
the
second
was
that
she
must
delay
no
longer
but
rise
up
and
serve
the
father
according
to
what
was
given
her
as
her
reward
when
she
had
recovered
a
little
of
her
rapture
she
rose
from
her
knees
and
stood
still
for
a
little
to
be
sure
which
way
she
was
to
go
and
she
was
not
aware
what
guided
her
but
yet
turned
her
face
in
the
appointed
way
without
any
doubt
for
doubt
was
now
gone
away
forever
and
that
fear
that
once
gave
her
so
much
trouble
lest
she
might
not
be
doing
what
was
best
as
she
moved
along
she
wondered
at
herself
more
and
more
she
felt
no
longer
as
at
first
like
the
child
she
remembered
to
have
been
venturing
out
in
the
awful
lovely
stillness
of
the
morning
before
any
one
was
awake
but
she
felt
that
to
move
along
was
a
delight
and
that
her
foot
scarcely
touched
the
grass
and
her
whole
being
was
instinct
with
such
lightness
of
strength
and
life
that
it
did
not
matter
to
her
how
far
she
went
nor
what
she
carried
nor
if
the
way
was
easy
or
hard
the
way
she
chose
was
one
of
those
which
led
to
the
great
gate
and
many
met
her
coming
from
thence
with
looks
that
were
somewhat
bewildered
as
if
they
did
not
yet
know
whither
they
were
going
or
what
had
happened
to
them
upon
whom
she
smiled
as
she
passed
them
with
soft
looks
of
tenderness
and
sympathy
knowing
what
they
were
feeling
but
did
not
stop
to
explain
to
them
because
she
had
something
else
that
had
been
given
her
to
do
for
this
is
what
always
follows
in
that
country
when
you
meet
the
lord
that
you
instantly
know
what
it
is
that
he
would
have
you
do
the
little
pilgrim
thus
went
on
and
on
toward
the
gate
which
she
had
not
seen
when
she
herself
came
through
it
having
been
lifted
in
his
arms
by
the
great
death
angel
and
set
down
softly
inside
so
that
she
did
not
know
it
or
even
the
shadow
of
it
as
she
drew
nearer
the
light
became
less
bright
though
very
sweet
like
a
lovely
dawn
and
she
wondered
to
herself
to
think
that
she
had
been
here
but
a
moment
ago
and
yet
so
much
had
passed
since
then
and
still
she
was
not
aware
what
was
her
errand
but
wondered
if
she
was
to
go
back
by
these
same
gates
and
perhaps
return
where
she
had
been
she
went
up
to
them
very
closely
for
she
was
curious
to
see
the
place
through
which
she
had
come
in
her
sleep
as
a
traveller
goes
back
to
see
the
city
gate
with
its
bridge
and
portcullis
through
which
he
has
passed
by
night
the
gate
was
very
great
of
a
wonderful
curious
architecture
having
strange
delicate
arches
and
canopies
above
some
parts
of
them
seemed
cut
very
clean
and
clear
but
the
outlines
were
all
softened
with
a
sort
of
mist
and
shadow
so
that
it
looked
greater
and
higher
than
it
was
the
lower
part
was
not
one
great
doorway
as
the
pilgrim
had
supposed
but
had
innumerable
doors
all
separate
and
very
narrow
so
that
but
one
could
pass
at
a
time
though
the
arch
inclosed
all
and
seemed
filled
with
great
folding
gates
in
which
the
smaller
doors
were
set
so
that
if
need
arose
a
vast
opening
might
be
made
for
many
to
enter
of
the
little
doors
many
were
shut
as
the
pilgrim
approached
but
from
moment
to
moment
one
after
another
would
be
pushed
softly
open
from
without
and
some
one
would
come
in
the
little
pilgrim
looked
at
it
all
with
great
interest
wondering
which
of
the
doors
she
herself
had
come
by
but
while
she
stood
absorbed
by
this
a
door
was
suddenly
pushed
open
close
by
her
and
some
one
flung
forward
into
the
blessed
country
falling
upon
the
ground
and
stretched
out
wild
arms
as
though
to
clutch
the
very
soil
this
sight
gave
the
pilgrim
a
great
surprise
for
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
heard
any
sound
of
pain
or
seen
any
sight
of
trouble
since
she
entered
here
in
that
moment
she
knew
what
it
was
that
the
dear
lord
had
given
her
to
do
she
had
no
need
to
pause
to
think
for
her
heart
told
her
and
she
did
not
hesitate
as
she
might
have
done
in
the
other
life
not
knowing
what
to
say
she
went
forward
and
gathered
this
poor
creature
into
her
arms
as
if
it
had
been
a
child
and
drew
her
quite
within
the
land
of
peace
for
she
had
fallen
across
the
threshold
so
as
to
hinder
any
one
entering
who
might
be
coming
after
her
it
was
a
woman
and
she
had
flung
herself
upon
her
face
so
that
it
was
difficult
for
the
little
pilgrim
to
see
what
manner
of
person
it
was
for
though
she
felt
herself
strong
enough
to
take
up
this
in
her
arms
and
carry
her
away
yet
she
forbore
seeing
the
will
of
the
stranger
was
not
so
for
some
time
this
woman
lay
moaning
with
now
and
then
a
great
sob
shaking
her
as
she
lay
the
little
pilgrim
had
taken
her
by
both
her
arms
and
drawn
her
head
to
rest
upon
her
own
lap
and
was
still
holding
the
hands
which
the
poor
creature
had
thrown
out
as
if
to
clutch
the
ground
thus
she
lay
for
a
little
while
as
the
little
pilgrim
remembered
she
herself
had
lain
not
wishing
to
move
wondering
what
had
happened
to
her
then
she
clutched
the
hands
which
grasped
her
and
said
muttering
you
are
some
one
new
have
you
come
to
save
me
oh
save
me
oh
save
me
do
let
me
die
this
was
very
strange
to
the
little
pilgrim
and
went
to
her
heart
she
soothed
the
stranger
holding
her
hands
warm
and
light
and
stooping
over
her
dear
she
said
you
must
try
and
not
be
afraid
you
say
so
said
the
woman
because
you
are
well
and
strong
you
know
what
it
is
to
be
seized
in
the
middle
of
your
life
and
told
that
you
got
to
die
oh
i
have
been
a
sinful
creature
i
am
not
fit
to
die
ca
you
give
me
something
that
will
cure
me
what
is
the
good
of
doctors
and
nurses
if
they
can
not
save
a
poor
soul
that
is
not
fit
to
die
at
this
the
little
pilgrim
smiled
upon
her
always
holding
her
fast
and
said
why
are
you
so
afraid
to
die
the
woman
raised
her
head
to
see
who
it
was
who
put
such
a
strange
question
to
her
you
are
some
one
new
she
said
i
have
never
seen
you
before
is
there
any
one
that
is
not
afraid
to
die
would
like
to
have
to
give
your
account
all
in
a
moment
without
any
time
to
prepare
but
you
have
had
time
to
prepare
said
the
pilgrim
oh
only
a
very
very
little
time
and
i
never
thought
it
was
true
i
am
not
an
old
woman
and
i
am
not
fit
to
die
and
i
poor
oh
if
i
were
rich
i
would
bribe
you
to
give
me
something
to
keep
me
alive
wo
you
do
it
for
pity
wo
you
do
it
for
pity
when
you
are
as
bad
as
i
am
oh
you
will
perhaps
call
for
some
one
to
help
you
and
find
nobody
like
me
i
will
help
you
for
love
said
the
little
pilgrim
some
one
who
loves
you
has
sent
me
the
woman
lifted
herself
up
a
little
and
shook
her
head
there
is
nobody
that
loves
me
then
she
cast
her
eyes
round
her
and
began
to
tremble
again
for
the
touch
of
the
little
pilgrim
had
stilled
her
oh
where
am
i
she
said
they
have
taken
me
away
they
have
brought
me
to
a
strange
place
and
you
are
new
oh
where
have
they
taken
me
where
am
i
where
am
i
she
cried
have
they
brought
me
here
to
die
then
the
little
pilgrim
bent
over
her
and
soothed
her
you
must
not
be
so
much
afraid
of
dying
that
is
all
over
you
need
not
fear
that
any
more
she
said
softly
for
here
where
you
now
are
we
have
all
died
the
woman
started
up
out
of
her
arms
and
then
she
gave
a
great
shriek
that
made
the
air
ring
and
cried
out
dead
am
i
dead
with
a
shudder
and
convulsion
throwing
herself
again
wildly
with
outstretched
hands
upon
the
ground
this
was
a
great
and
terrible
work
for
the
little
pilgrim
the
first
she
had
ever
had
to
do
and
her
heart
failed
her
for
a
moment
but
afterward
she
remembered
our
brother
who
sent
her
and
knew
what
was
best
she
drew
closer
to
the
and
took
her
hand
again
try
she
said
in
a
soft
voice
and
think
a
little
do
you
feel
now
so
ill
as
you
were
do
not
be
frightened
but
think
a
little
i
will
hold
your
hand
and
look
at
me
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
the
poor
creature
shuddered
again
and
then
she
turned
her
face
and
looked
doubtfully
with
great
dark
eyes
dilated
and
the
brow
and
cheek
so
curved
and
puckered
round
them
that
they
seemed
to
glow
out
of
deep
caverns
her
face
was
full
of
anguish
and
fear
but
as
she
looked
at
the
little
pilgrim
her
troubled
gaze
softened
of
her
own
accord
she
clasped
her
other
hand
upon
the
one
that
held
hers
and
then
she
said
with
a
gasp
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
that
was
not
true
that
you
said
you
are
one
of
the
sisters
and
you
want
to
frighten
me
and
make
me
repent
you
do
repent
the
pilgrim
said
oh
cried
the
poor
woman
what
has
the
like
of
you
to
do
with
me
now
i
look
at
you
i
never
saw
any
one
that
was
like
you
before
do
you
hate
me
do
you
loathe
me
i
do
myself
it
so
ugly
to
go
wrong
i
think
now
i
would
almost
rather
die
and
be
done
with
it
you
will
say
that
is
because
i
am
going
to
get
better
i
feel
a
great
deal
better
now
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
get
over
it
oh
i
am
better
i
could
get
up
out
of
bed
and
walk
about
yes
but
i
am
not
in
bed
where
have
you
brought
me
never
mind
it
is
a
fine
air
i
shall
soon
get
well
here
the
pilgrim
was
silent
for
a
little
holding
her
hands
and
then
she
said
tell
me
how
you
feel
now
in
her
soft
voice
the
woman
had
sat
up
and
was
gazing
round
her
it
is
very
strange
she
said
it
is
all
confused
i
think
upon
my
mother
and
the
old
prayers
i
used
to
say
for
a
long
long
time
i
always
said
my
prayers
but
now
got
hardened
they
say
oh
i
was
once
as
fresh
as
any
one
it
all
comes
over
me
now
i
feel
as
if
i
were
young
again
just
come
out
of
the
country
i
am
sure
that
i
could
walk
the
little
pilgrim
raised
her
up
holding
her
by
her
hands
and
she
stood
and
gazed
round
about
her
making
one
or
two
doubtful
steps
she
was
very
pale
and
the
light
was
dim
her
eyes
peered
into
it
with
a
scared
yet
eager
look
she
made
another
step
then
stopped
again
i
am
quite
well
she
said
i
could
walk
a
mile
i
could
walk
any
distance
what
was
that
you
said
oh
i
tell
you
i
am
better
i
am
not
going
to
die
you
will
never
never
die
said
the
little
pilgrim
are
you
not
glad
it
is
all
over
oh
i
was
so
glad
and
all
the
more
you
should
be
glad
if
you
were
so
much
afraid
but
this
woman
was
not
glad
she
shrank
away
from
her
companion
then
came
close
to
her
again
and
gripped
her
with
her
hands
it
is
your
fun
she
said
or
just
to
frighten
me
perhaps
you
think
it
will
do
me
no
harm
as
i
am
getting
so
well
you
want
to
frighten
me
to
make
me
good
but
i
mean
to
be
good
without
that
i
do
i
do
when
one
is
so
near
dying
as
i
have
been
and
yet
gets
better
for
i
am
going
to
get
better
yes
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
the
little
pilgrim
made
no
reply
but
stood
by
looking
at
her
charge
not
feeling
that
anything
was
given
her
to
say
and
she
was
so
new
to
this
work
that
there
was
a
little
trembling
in
her
lest
she
should
not
do
everything
as
she
ought
and
the
woman
looked
round
with
those
anxious
eyes
gazing
all
about
the
light
did
not
brighten
as
it
had
done
when
the
pilgrim
herself
first
came
to
this
place
for
one
thing
they
had
remained
quite
close
to
the
gate
which
no
doubt
threw
a
shadow
the
woman
looked
at
that
and
then
turned
and
looked
into
the
dim
morning
and
did
not
know
where
she
was
and
her
heart
was
confused
and
troubled
where
are
we
she
said
i
do
not
know
where
it
is
they
must
have
brought
me
here
in
my
sleep
where
are
we
how
strange
to
bring
a
sick
woman
away
out
of
her
room
in
her
sleep
i
suppose
it
was
the
new
doctor
she
went
on
looking
very
closely
in
the
little
pilgrim
face
then
paused
and
drawing
a
long
breath
said
softly
it
has
done
me
good
it
is
better
air
it
is
a
new
kind
of
cure
but
though
she
spoke
like
this
she
did
not
convince
herself
her
eyes
were
wild
with
wondering
and
fear
she
gripped
the
pilgrim
arm
more
and
more
closely
and
trembled
leaning
upon
her
why
do
you
speak
to
me
she
said
why
do
you
tell
me
oh
i
do
know
how
to
live
in
this
place
what
do
you
do
how
do
you
speak
i
am
not
fit
for
it
and
what
are
you
i
never
saw
you
before
nor
any
one
like
you
what
do
you
want
with
me
why
are
you
so
kind
to
me
why
why
and
here
she
went
off
into
a
murmur
of
questions
why
why
always
holding
fast
by
the
little
pilgrim
always
gazing
round
her
groping
as
it
were
in
the
dimness
with
her
great
eyes
i
have
come
because
our
dear
lord
who
is
our
brother
sent
me
to
meet
you
and
because
i
love
you
the
little
pilgrim
said
love
me
the
woman
cried
throwing
up
her
hands
but
no
one
loves
me
i
have
not
deserved
it
here
she
grasped
her
close
again
with
a
sudden
clutch
and
cried
out
if
this
is
what
you
say
where
is
god
are
you
afraid
of
him
the
little
pilgrim
said
upon
which
the
woman
trembled
so
that
the
pilgrim
trembled
too
with
the
quivering
of
her
frame
then
loosed
her
hold
and
fell
upon
her
face
and
cried
hide
me
hide
me
i
have
been
a
great
sinner
hide
me
that
he
may
not
see
me
and
with
one
hand
she
tried
to
draw
the
pilgrim
dress
as
a
veil
between
her
and
something
she
feared
how
should
i
hide
you
from
him
who
is
everywhere
and
why
should
i
hide
you
from
your
father
the
little
pilgrim
said
this
she
said
almost
with
indignation
wondering
that
any
one
could
put
more
trust
in
her
who
was
no
better
than
a
child
than
in
the
father
of
all
but
then
she
said
look
into
your
heart
and
you
will
see
you
are
not
so
much
afraid
as
you
think
this
is
how
you
have
been
accustomed
to
frighten
yourself
but
now
look
into
your
heart
you
thought
you
were
very
ill
at
first
but
not
now
and
you
think
you
are
afraid
but
look
into
your
heart
there
was
a
silence
and
then
the
woman
raised
her
head
with
a
wonderful
look
in
which
there
was
amazement
and
doubt
as
if
she
had
heard
some
joyful
thing
but
dared
not
yet
believe
that
it
was
true
once
more
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
once
more
raised
it
again
her
eyes
softened
a
long
sigh
or
gasp
like
one
taking
breath
after
drowning
shook
her
breast
then
she
said
i
think
that
is
true
but
if
i
am
not
afraid
it
is
because
i
am
bad
it
is
because
i
am
hardened
oh
should
not
i
fear
him
who
can
send
me
away
into
the
lake
that
burns
into
the
pit
and
here
she
gave
a
great
cry
but
held
the
little
pilgrim
all
the
while
with
her
eyes
which
seemed
to
plead
and
ask
for
better
news
then
there
came
into
the
pilgrim
heart
what
to
say
and
she
took
the
woman
hand
again
and
held
it
between
her
own
that
is
the
change
she
said
that
comes
when
we
come
here
we
are
not
afraid
any
more
of
our
father
we
are
not
all
happy
perhaps
you
will
not
be
happy
at
first
but
if
he
says
to
you
even
to
that
place
you
speak
of
you
will
know
that
it
is
well
and
you
will
not
be
afraid
you
are
not
afraid
now
oh
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
you
are
not
happy
but
you
are
not
afraid
you
know
it
is
the
father
do
not
say
god
that
is
far
off
father
said
the
little
pilgrim
holding
up
the
woman
hand
clasped
in
her
own
and
there
came
into
her
soul
an
ecstasy
and
tears
that
were
tears
of
blessedness
fell
from
her
eyes
and
all
about
her
there
seemed
to
shine
a
light
when
she
came
to
herself
the
woman
who
was
her
charge
had
come
quite
close
to
her
and
had
added
her
other
hand
to
that
the
pilgrim
held
and
was
weeping
and
saying
i
am
not
afraid
with
now
and
then
a
gasp
and
sob
like
a
child
who
after
a
passion
of
tears
has
been
consoled
yet
goes
on
sobbing
and
can
not
quite
forget
and
is
afraid
to
own
that
all
is
well
again
then
the
pilgrim
kissed
her
and
bade
her
rest
a
little
for
even
she
herself
felt
shaken
and
longed
for
a
little
quiet
and
to
feel
the
true
sense
of
the
peace
that
was
in
her
heart
she
sat
down
beside
her
upon
the
ground
and
made
her
lean
her
head
against
her
shoulder
and
thus
they
remained
very
still
for
a
little
time
saying
no
more
it
seemed
to
the
little
pilgrim
that
her
companion
had
fallen
asleep
and
perhaps
it
was
so
after
so
much
agitation
all
this
time
there
had
been
people
passing
entering
by
the
many
doors
and
most
of
them
paused
a
little
to
see
where
they
were
and
looked
round
them
then
went
on
and
it
seemed
to
the
little
pilgrim
that
according
to
the
doors
by
which
they
entered
each
took
a
different
way
while
she
watched
another
came
in
by
the
same
door
as
that
at
which
the
woman
who
was
her
charge
had
come
in
and
he
too
stumbled
and
looked
about
him
with
an
air
of
great
wonder
and
doubt
when
he
saw
her
seated
on
the
ground
he
came
up
to
her
hesitating
as
one
in
a
strange
place
who
does
not
want
to
betray
that
he
is
bewildered
and
has
lost
his
way
he
came
with
a
little
pretence
of
smiling
though
his
countenance
was
pale
and
scared
and
said
drawing
his
breath
quick
i
ought
to
know
where
i
am
but
i
have
lost
my
head
i
think
will
you
tell
me
which
is
the
way
what
way
cried
the
little
pilgrim
for
her
strength
was
gone
from
her
and
she
had
no
word
to
say
to
him
he
looked
at
her
with
that
bewilderment
on
his
face
and
said
i
find
myself
strange
strange
i
ought
to
know
where
i
am
but
it
is
scarcely
daylight
yet
it
is
perhaps
foolish
to
come
out
so
early
in
the
morning
this
he
said
in
his
confusion
not
knowing
where
he
was
nor
what
he
said
i
think
all
the
ways
lead
to
our
father
said
the
little
pilgrim
though
she
had
not
known
this
till
now
and
the
dear
lord
walks
about
them
all
here
you
never
go
astray
upon
this
the
stranger
looked
at
her
and
asked
in
a
faltering
voice
are
you
an
angel
still
not
knowing
what
he
said
oh
no
no
i
am
only
a
pilgrim
she
replied
may
i
sit
by
you
a
little
said
the
man
he
sat
down
drawing
long
breaths
as
though
he
had
gone
through
great
fatigue
and
looked
about
with
wondering
eyes
you
will
wonder
but
i
do
not
know
where
i
am
he
said
i
feel
as
if
i
must
he
dreaming
this
is
not
where
i
expected
to
come
i
looked
for
something
very
different
do
you
think
there
can
have
been
any
mistake
oh
never
that
she
said
there
are
no
mistakes
here
then
he
looked
at
her
again
and
said
i
perceive
that
you
belong
to
this
country
though
you
say
you
are
a
pilgrim
i
should
be
grateful
if
you
would
tell
me
does
one
live
here
and
is
this
all
is
there
no
no
but
i
do
know
what
word
to
use
all
is
so
strange
different
from
what
i
expected
do
you
know
that
you
have
died
yes
yes
i
am
quite
acquainted
with
that
he
said
hurriedly
as
if
it
had
been
an
idea
he
disliked
to
dwell
upon
but
then
i
expected
is
there
no
one
to
tell
you
where
to
go
or
what
you
are
to
be
or
to
take
any
notice
of
you
the
little
pilgrim
was
startled
by
this
tone
she
did
not
understand
its
meaning
and
she
had
not
any
word
to
say
to
him
she
looked
at
him
with
as
much
bewilderment
as
he
had
shown
when
he
approached
her
and
replied
faltering
there
are
a
great
many
people
here
but
i
have
never
heard
if
there
is
any
one
to
tell
you
what
does
it
matter
how
many
people
there
are
if
you
know
none
of
them
he
said
we
all
know
each
other
she
answered
him
but
then
paused
and
hesitated
a
little
because
this
was
what
had
been
said
to
her
and
of
herself
she
was
not
assured
of
it
neither
did
she
know
at
all
how
to
deal
with
this
stranger
to
whom
she
had
not
any
commission
it
seemed
that
he
had
no
one
to
care
for
him
and
the
little
pilgrim
had
a
sense
of
compassion
yet
of
trouble
in
her
heart
for
what
could
she
say
and
it
was
very
strange
to
her
to
see
one
who
was
not
content
here
ah
but
there
should
be
some
one
to
point
out
the
way
and
tell
us
which
is
our
circle
and
where
we
ought
to
go
he
said
and
then
he
too
was
silent
for
a
while
looking
about
him
as
all
were
fain
to
do
on
their
first
arrival
finding
everything
so
strange
there
were
people
coming
in
at
every
moment
and
some
were
met
at
the
very
threshold
and
some
went
away
alone
with
peaceful
faces
and
there
were
many
groups
about
talking
together
in
soft
voices
but
no
one
interrupted
the
other
and
though
so
many
were
there
each
voice
was
as
clear
as
if
it
had
spoken
alone
and
there
was
no
tumult
of
sound
as
when
many
people
assemble
together
in
the
lower
world
the
little
pilgrim
wondered
to
find
herself
with
the
woman
resting
upon
her
on
one
side
and
the
man
seated
silent
on
the
other
neither
having
it
appeared
any
guide
but
only
herself
who
knew
so
little
how
was
she
to
lead
them
in
the
paths
which
she
did
not
know
and
she
was
exhausted
by
the
agitation
of
her
struggle
with
the
woman
whom
she
felt
to
be
her
charge
but
in
this
moment
of
silence
she
had
time
to
remember
the
face
of
the
lord
when
he
gave
her
this
commission
and
her
heart
was
strengthened
the
man
all
this
time
sat
and
watched
looking
eagerly
all
about
him
examining
the
faces
of
those
who
went
and
came
and
sometimes
he
made
a
little
start
as
if
to
go
and
speak
to
some
one
he
knew
but
always
drew
back
again
and
looked
at
the
little
pilgrim
as
if
he
had
said
this
is
the
one
who
will
serve
me
best
he
spoke
to
her
again
after
a
while
and
said
i
suppose
you
are
one
of
the
guides
that
show
the
way
no
said
the
little
pilgrim
anxiously
i
know
so
little
it
is
not
long
since
i
came
here
i
came
in
the
early
morning
why
it
is
morning
now
you
could
not
come
earlier
than
it
is
now
you
mean
yesterday
i
think
said
the
pilgrim
that
yesterday
is
the
other
side
there
is
no
yesterday
here
he
looked
at
her
with
the
keen
look
he
had
to
understand
her
the
better
and
then
he
said
no
division
of
time
i
think
that
must
be
monotonous
it
will
be
strange
to
have
no
night
but
i
suppose
one
gets
used
to
everything
i
hope
though
there
is
something
to
do
i
have
always
lived
a
very
busy
life
perhaps
this
is
just
a
little
pause
before
we
go
to
be
to
have
to
get
our
appointed
place
he
had
an
uneasy
look
as
he
said
this
and
looked
at
her
with
an
anxious
curiosity
which
the
little
pilgrim
did
not
understand
i
do
not
know
she
said
softly
shaking
her
head
i
have
so
little
experience
i
have
not
been
told
of
an
appointed
place
the
man
looked
at
her
very
strangely
i
did
not
think
he
said
that
i
should
have
found
such
ignorance
here
is
it
not
well
known
that
we
must
all
appear
before
the
of
god
there
words
seemed
to
cause
a
trembling
on
the
still
air
and
the
woman
on
the
other
side
raised
herself
suddenly
up
clasping
her
hands
and
some
of
those
who
had
just
entered
heard
the
words
and
came
and
crowded
about
the
little
pilgrim
some
standing
some
falling
down
upon
their
knee
all
with
their
faces
turned
towards
her
she
who
had
always
been
so
simple
and
small
so
little
used
to
teach
she
was
frightened
with
the
sight
of
all
these
strangers
crowding
hanging
upon
her
lips
looking
to
her
for
knowledge
she
knew
not
what
to
do
or
what
to
say
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
oh
she
said
i
do
not
know
anything
about
a
i
know
that
our
father
is
here
and
that
when
we
are
in
trouble
we
are
taken
to
him
to
be
comforted
and
that
our
dear
lord
our
brother
is
among
us
every
day
and
every
one
may
see
him
listen
she
said
standing
up
suddenly
among
them
feeling
strong
as
an
angel
i
have
seen
him
though
i
am
nothing
so
little
as
you
see
and
often
silly
never
clever
as
some
of
you
are
i
have
seen
him
and
so
will
all
of
you
there
is
no
more
that
i
know
of
she
said
softly
clasping
her
hands
when
you
see
him
it
comes
into
your
heart
what
you
must
do
and
then
there
was
a
murmur
of
voices
about
her
some
saying
that
was
best
and
some
wondering
if
that
were
all
and
some
crying
if
he
would
but
come
now
while
the
little
pilgrim
stood
among
them
with
her
face
shining
and
they
all
looked
at
her
asking
her
to
tell
them
more
to
show
them
how
to
find
him
but
this
was
far
above
what
she
could
do
for
she
too
was
not
much
more
than
a
stranger
and
had
little
strength
she
would
not
go
back
a
step
nor
desert
those
who
were
so
anxious
to
know
though
her
heart
fluttered
almost
as
it
had
used
to
do
before
she
died
what
with
her
longing
to
tell
them
and
knowing
that
she
had
no
more
to
say
but
in
that
land
it
is
never
permitted
that
one
who
stands
bravely
and
fails
not
shall
be
left
without
succor
for
it
is
no
longer
needful
there
to
stand
even
to
death
since
all
dying
is
over
and
all
souls
are
tested
when
it
was
seen
that
the
little
pilgrim
was
thus
surrounded
by
so
many
that
questioned
her
there
suddenly
came
about
her
many
others
from
the
brightness
out
of
which
she
had
come
who
one
going
to
one
hand
and
one
to
another
safely
led
them
into
the
ways
in
which
their
course
lay
so
that
the
pilgrim
was
free
to
lead
forth
the
woman
who
had
been
given
her
in
charge
and
whose
path
lay
in
a
dim
but
pleasant
country
outside
of
that
light
and
gladness
in
which
the
pilgrim
home
was
but
she
said
you
are
not
to
fear
or
be
cast
down
because
he
goes
likewise
by
these
ways
and
there
is
not
a
corner
in
all
this
land
but
he
is
to
be
seen
passing
by
and
he
will
come
and
speak
to
you
and
lay
his
hand
upon
you
and
afterwards
everything
will
be
clear
and
you
will
know
what
you
are
to
do
stay
with
me
till
he
comes
oh
stay
with
me
the
woman
cried
clinging
to
her
arm
unless
another
is
sent
the
little
pilgrim
said
and
it
was
nothing
to
her
that
the
air
was
less
bright
there
for
her
mind
was
full
of
light
so
that
though
her
heart
still
fluttered
a
little
with
all
that
had
passed
she
had
no
longing
to
return
nor
to
shorten
the
way
but
went
by
the
lower
road
sweetly
with
the
stranger
hanging
upon
her
who
was
stronger
and
taller
than
she
thus
they
went
on
and
the
pilgrim
told
her
all
she
knew
and
everything
that
came
into
her
heart
and
so
full
was
she
of
the
great
things
she
had
to
say
that
it
was
a
surprise
to
her
and
left
her
trembling
when
suddenly
the
woman
took
away
her
clinging
hand
and
flew
forward
with
arms
and
a
cry
of
joy
the
little
pilgrim
stood
still
to
see
and
on
the
path
before
them
was
a
child
coming
towards
them
singing
with
a
look
such
as
is
never
seen
but
upon
the
faces
of
children
who
have
come
here
early
and
who
behold
the
face
of
the
father
and
have
never
known
fear
nor
sorrow
the
woman
flew
and
fell
at
the
child
feet
and
he
put
his
hand
upon
her
and
raised
her
up
and
called
her
mother
then
he
smiled
upon
the
little
pilgrim
and
led
her
away
now
she
needs
me
no
longer
said
the
pilgrim
and
it
was
a
surprise
to
her
and
for
a
moment
she
wondered
in
herself
if
it
was
known
that
this
child
should
come
so
suddenly
and
her
work
be
over
and
also
how
she
was
to
return
again
to
the
sweet
place
among
the
flowers
from
which
she
had
come
but
when
she
turned
to
look
if
there
was
any
way
she
found
one
standing
by
such
as
she
had
not
yet
seen
this
was
a
youth
with
a
face
just
touched
with
manhood
as
at
the
moment
when
the
boy
ends
when
all
is
still
fresh
and
pure
in
the
heart
but
he
was
taller
and
greater
than
a
man
i
am
sent
he
said
little
sister
to
take
you
to
the
father
because
you
have
been
very
faithful
and
gone
beyond
your
strength
and
he
took
the
little
pilgrim
by
the
hand
and
she
knew
he
was
an
angel
and
immediately
the
sweet
air
melted
about
them
into
light
and
a
hush
came
upon
her
of
all
thought
and
all
sense
attending
till
she
should
receive
the
blessing
and
her
new
name
and
see
what
is
beyond
telling
and
hear
and
understand
ii
the
little
pilgrim
goes
up
higher
when
the
little
pilgrim
came
out
of
the
presence
of
the
father
she
found
herself
in
the
street
of
a
great
city
but
what
she
saw
and
heard
when
she
was
with
him
it
is
not
given
to
the
tongue
of
mortal
to
say
for
it
is
beyond
words
and
beyond
even
thought
as
the
mystery
of
love
is
not
to
be
spoken
but
to
be
felt
even
in
the
lower
earth
so
but
much
less
is
that
great
mystery
of
the
love
of
the
father
to
be
expressed
in
sound
the
little
pilgrim
was
very
happy
when
she
went
into
that
sacred
place
but
there
was
a
great
awe
upon
her
and
it
might
even
be
said
that
she
was
afraid
but
when
she
came
out
again
she
feared
nothing
but
looked
with
clear
eyes
upon
all
she
saw
loving
them
but
no
more
overawed
by
them
having
seen
that
which
is
above
all
when
she
came
forth
again
to
her
common
life
for
it
is
not
permitted
save
for
those
who
have
attained
the
greatest
heights
to
dwell
there
she
had
no
longer
need
of
any
guide
but
came
alone
knowing
where
to
go
and
walking
where
it
pleased
her
with
reverence
and
a
great
delight
in
seeing
and
knowing
all
that
was
around
but
no
fear
it
was
a
great
city
but
it
was
not
like
the
great
cities
which
she
had
seen
she
understood
as
she
passed
along
how
it
was
that
those
who
had
been
dazzled
but
by
a
passing
glance
had
described
the
walls
and
the
pavement
as
gold
they
were
like
what
gold
is
beautiful
and
clear
of
a
lovely
color
but
softer
in
tone
than
metal
ever
was
and
as
cool
and
fresh
to
walk
upon
and
to
touch
as
if
they
had
been
velvet
grass
the
buildings
were
all
beautiful
of
every
style
and
form
that
it
is
possible
to
think
of
yet
in
great
harmony
as
if
every
man
had
followed
his
own
taste
yet
all
had
been
so
combined
and
grouped
by
the
master
architect
that
each
individual
feature
enhanced
the
effect
of
the
rest
some
of
the
houses
were
greater
and
some
smaller
but
all
of
them
were
rich
in
carvings
and
pictures
and
lovely
decorations
and
the
effect
was
as
if
the
richest
materials
had
been
employed
marbles
and
beautiful
sculptured
stone
and
wood
of
beautiful
tints
though
the
little
pilgrim
knew
that
these
were
not
like
the
marble
and
stone
she
had
once
known
but
heavenly
representatives
of
them
far
better
than
they
there
were
people
at
work
upon
them
building
new
houses
and
making
additions
and
a
great
many
painters
painting
upon
them
the
history
of
the
people
who
lived
there
or
of
others
who
were
worthy
that
commemoration
and
the
streets
were
full
of
pleasant
sound
and
of
crowds
going
and
coming
and
the
commotion
of
much
business
and
many
things
to
do
and
this
movement
and
the
brightness
of
the
air
and
the
wonderful
things
that
were
to
be
seen
on
every
side
made
the
pilgrim
gay
so
that
she
could
have
sung
with
pleasure
as
she
went
along
and
all
who
met
her
smiled
and
every
group
exchanged
greetings
as
they
passed
along
all
knowing
each
other
many
of
them
as
might
be
seen
had
come
there
as
she
did
to
see
the
wonders
of
the
beautiful
city
and
all
who
lived
there
were
ready
to
tell
them
whatever
they
desired
to
know
and
show
them
the
finest
houses
and
the
greatest
pictures
and
this
gave
a
feeling
of
holiday
and
pleasure
which
was
delightful
beyond
description
for
all
the
busy
people
about
were
full
of
sympathy
with
the
strangers
bidding
them
welcome
inviting
them
into
their
houses
making
the
warmest
fellowship
and
friends
were
meeting
continually
on
every
side
but
the
pilgrim
had
no
sense
that
she
was
forlorn
in
being
alone
for
all
were
friends
and
it
pleased
her
to
watch
the
others
and
see
how
one
turned
this
way
and
one
another
every
one
finding
something
that
delighted
him
above
all
other
things
she
herself
took
a
great
pleasure
in
watching
a
painter
who
was
standing
upon
a
balcony
a
little
way
above
her
painting
upon
a
great
fresco
and
when
he
saw
this
he
asked
her
to
come
up
beside
him
and
see
his
work
she
asked
him
a
great
many
questions
about
it
and
why
it
was
that
he
was
working
only
at
the
draperies
of
the
figures
and
did
not
touch
their
faces
some
of
which
were
already
finished
and
seemed
to
be
looking
at
her
as
living
as
she
was
out
of
the
wall
while
some
were
merely
outlined
as
yet
he
told
her
that
he
was
not
a
great
painter
to
do
this
or
to
design
the
great
work
but
that
the
master
would
come
presently
who
had
the
chief
responsibility
for
we
have
not
all
the
same
genius
he
said
and
if
i
were
to
paint
this
head
it
would
not
have
the
gift
of
life
as
that
one
has
but
to
stand
by
and
see
him
put
it
in
you
can
not
think
what
a
happiness
that
is
for
one
knows
every
touch
and
just
what
effect
it
will
have
though
one
could
not
do
it
one
self
and
it
is
a
wonder
and
a
delight
perpetual
that
it
should
be
done
the
little
pilgrim
looked
up
at
him
and
said
that
is
very
beautiful
to
say
and
do
you
never
wish
to
be
like
him
to
make
the
lovely
living
faces
as
well
as
the
other
parts
is
not
this
lovely
too
he
said
and
showed
her
how
he
had
just
put
in
a
billowy
robe
buoyed
out
with
the
wind
and
sweeping
down
from
the
shoulders
of
a
stately
figure
in
such
free
and
graceful
folds
that
she
would
have
liked
to
take
it
in
her
hand
and
feel
the
silken
texture
and
then
he
told
her
how
absorbing
it
was
to
study
the
mysteries
of
color
and
the
differences
of
light
there
is
enough
in
that
to
make
one
happy
he
said
it
is
thought
by
some
that
we
will
all
come
to
the
higher
point
with
work
and
thought
but
that
is
not
my
feeling
and
whether
it
is
so
or
not
what
does
it
matter
for
our
father
makes
no
difference
and
all
of
us
are
necessary
to
everything
that
is
done
and
it
is
almost
more
delight
to
see
the
master
do
it
than
to
do
it
with
one
own
hand
for
one
thing
your
own
work
may
rejoice
you
in
your
heart
but
always
with
a
little
trembling
because
it
is
never
so
perfect
as
you
would
have
it
whereas
in
your
master
work
you
have
full
content
because
his
idea
goes
beyond
yours
and
as
he
makes
every
touch
you
can
feel
is
right
that
is
complete
that
is
just
as
it
ought
to
be
do
you
understand
what
i
mean
he
said
turning
to
her
with
a
smile
i
understand
it
perfectly
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
together
with
the
delight
of
accord
do
you
think
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
are
so
happy
here
you
understand
at
half
a
word
not
everybody
he
said
and
smiled
upon
her
like
a
brother
for
we
are
not
all
alike
even
here
were
you
a
painter
she
said
in
in
the
other
in
the
old
times
i
was
one
of
those
that
strove
for
the
mastery
and
sometimes
grudged
we
remember
these
things
at
times
he
said
gravely
to
make
us
more
aware
of
the
blessedness
of
being
content
it
is
long
since
then
she
said
with
some
wistfulness
upon
which
he
smiled
again
so
long
he
said
that
we
have
worn
out
most
of
our
links
to
the
world
below
we
have
all
come
away
and
those
who
were
after
us
for
generations
but
you
are
a
and
are
they
all
with
you
are
you
all
together
do
you
live
as
in
the
old
time
upon
this
the
painter
smiled
but
not
so
brightly
as
before
not
as
in
the
old
time
he
said
nor
are
they
all
here
some
are
still
upon
the
way
and
of
some
we
have
no
certainty
only
news
from
time
to
time
the
angels
are
very
good
to
us
they
never
miss
an
occasion
to
bring
us
news
for
they
go
everywhere
you
know
yes
said
the
little
pilgrim
though
indeed
she
had
not
known
it
till
now
but
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
it
had
come
to
her
mind
by
nature
and
she
had
never
needed
to
be
told
they
are
so
the
painter
said
and
more
than
that
they
are
very
curious
about
men
and
women
they
have
known
it
all
from
the
beginning
and
it
is
a
wonder
to
them
there
is
a
friend
of
mine
an
angel
who
is
more
wise
in
men
hearts
than
any
one
i
know
and
yet
he
will
say
to
me
sometimes
do
not
understand
you
you
are
wonderful
they
like
to
find
out
all
we
are
thinking
it
is
an
endless
pleasure
to
them
just
as
it
is
to
some
of
us
to
watch
the
people
in
the
other
worlds
do
you
mean
where
we
have
come
from
said
the
little
pilgrim
not
always
there
we
in
this
city
have
been
long
separated
from
that
country
for
all
that
we
love
are
out
of
it
but
not
here
the
little
pilgrim
cried
again
with
a
little
sorrow
a
pang
that
she
knew
was
going
to
be
put
away
in
her
heart
but
coming
coming
said
the
painter
cheerfully
and
some
were
here
before
us
and
some
have
arrived
since
they
are
everywhere
but
some
in
trouble
some
in
trouble
she
cried
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
we
suppose
so
he
said
gravely
for
some
are
in
that
place
which
once
was
called
among
us
the
place
of
despair
you
mean
and
though
the
little
pilgrim
had
been
made
free
of
fear
at
that
word
which
she
would
not
speak
she
trembled
and
the
light
grew
dim
in
her
eyes
well
said
her
new
friend
and
what
then
the
father
sees
through
and
through
it
as
he
does
here
they
can
not
escape
him
so
that
there
is
love
near
them
always
i
have
a
son
he
said
then
sighed
a
little
but
smiled
again
who
is
there
the
little
pilgrim
at
this
clasped
her
hands
with
a
piteous
cry
nay
nay
he
said
little
sister
my
friend
i
was
telling
you
of
the
angel
brought
me
news
of
him
just
now
indeed
there
was
news
of
him
through
all
the
city
did
you
not
hear
all
the
bells
ringing
but
perhaps
that
was
before
you
came
the
angels
who
know
me
best
came
one
after
another
to
tell
me
and
our
lord
himself
came
to
wish
me
joy
my
son
had
found
the
way
the
little
pilgrim
did
not
understand
this
and
almost
thought
that
the
painter
must
be
mistaken
or
dreaming
she
looked
at
him
very
anxiously
and
said
i
thought
that
those
unhappy
never
came
out
any
more
the
painter
smiled
at
her
in
return
and
said
had
you
children
in
the
old
time
she
paused
a
little
before
she
replied
i
had
children
in
love
she
said
but
none
that
were
born
mine
it
is
the
same
he
said
it
is
the
same
and
if
one
of
them
had
sinned
against
you
injured
you
done
wrong
in
any
way
would
you
have
cast
him
off
or
what
would
you
have
done
oh
said
the
little
pilgrim
again
with
a
vivid
light
of
memory
coming
into
her
face
which
showed
she
had
no
need
to
think
of
this
as
a
thing
that
might
have
happened
but
knew
i
brought
him
home
i
nursed
him
well
again
i
prayed
for
him
night
and
day
did
you
say
cast
him
off
when
he
had
most
need
of
me
then
i
never
could
have
loved
him
she
cried
the
painter
nodded
his
head
and
his
hand
with
the
pencil
in
it
for
he
had
turned
from
his
picture
to
look
at
her
then
you
think
you
love
better
than
our
father
he
said
and
turned
to
his
work
and
painted
a
new
fold
in
the
robe
which
looked
as
if
a
soft
air
had
suddenly
blown
into
it
and
not
the
touch
of
a
skilful
hand
this
made
the
pilgrim
tremble
as
though
in
her
ignorance
she
had
done
something
wrong
after
that
there
came
a
great
joy
into
her
heart
oh
how
happy
you
have
made
me
she
cried
i
am
glad
with
all
my
heart
for
you
and
your
son
then
she
paused
a
little
and
added
but
you
said
he
was
still
there
it
is
true
for
the
land
of
darkness
is
very
confusing
they
tell
me
for
want
of
the
true
light
and
our
dear
friends
the
angels
are
not
permitted
to
help
but
if
one
follows
them
that
shows
the
way
you
may
be
in
that
land
yet
on
your
way
hither
it
was
very
hard
to
understand
at
first
said
the
painter
there
are
some
sketches
i
could
show
you
no
one
has
ever
made
a
picture
of
it
though
many
have
tried
but
i
could
show
you
some
sketches
if
you
wish
to
see
to
this
the
little
pilgrim
look
was
so
plain
an
answer
that
the
painter
laid
down
his
pallet
and
his
brush
and
left
his
work
to
show
them
to
her
as
he
had
promised
they
went
down
from
the
balcony
and
along
the
street
until
they
came
to
one
of
the
great
palaces
where
many
were
coming
and
going
here
they
walked
through
some
vast
halls
where
students
were
working
at
easels
doing
every
kind
of
beautiful
work
some
painting
pictures
some
preparing
drawings
planning
houses
and
palaces
the
pilgrim
would
have
liked
to
pause
at
every
moment
to
see
one
lovely
thing
or
another
but
the
painter
walked
on
steadily
till
he
came
to
a
room
which
was
full
of
sketches
some
of
them
like
pictures
in
little
with
many
figures
some
of
them
only
a
representation
of
a
flower
or
the
wing
of
a
bird
these
are
all
the
master
he
said
sometimes
the
sight
of
them
will
be
enough
to
put
something
great
into
the
mind
of
another
in
this
corner
are
the
sketches
i
told
you
of
there
were
two
of
them
hanging
together
upon
the
wall
and
at
first
it
seemed
to
the
little
pilgrim
as
if
they
represented
the
flames
and
fire
of
which
she
had
read
and
this
made
her
shudder
for
the
moment
but
then
she
saw
that
it
was
a
red
light
like
a
stormy
sunset
with
masses
of
clouds
in
the
sky
and
a
low
sun
very
fiery
and
dazzling
which
no
doubt
to
a
hasty
glance
must
have
looked
with
its
dark
shadows
and
high
lurid
lights
like
the
fires
of
the
bottomless
pit
but
when
you
looked
down
you
saw
the
reality
what
it
was
the
country
that
lay
beneath
was
full
of
tropical
foliage
but
with
many
stretches
of
sand
and
dry
plains
and
in
the
foreground
was
a
town
that
looked
very
prosperous
and
crowded
though
the
figures
were
very
minute
the
subject
being
so
great
but
no
one
to
see
it
would
have
taken
it
for
anything
but
a
busy
and
wealthy
place
in
a
thunderous
atmosphere
with
a
storm
coming
on
in
the
next
there
was
a
section
of
a
street
with
a
great
banqueting
hall
open
to
the
view
and
many
people
sitting
about
the
table
you
could
see
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
laughter
and
conversation
going
on
some
very
noisy
groups
but
others
that
sat
more
quietly
in
corners
and
conversed
and
some
who
sang
and
every
kind
of
entertainment
the
little
pilgrim
was
very
much
astonished
to
see
this
and
turned
to
the
painter
who
answered
her
directly
though
she
had
not
spoken
we
used
to
think
differently
once
there
are
some
who
are
there
and
do
not
know
it
they
think
only
it
is
the
old
life
over
again
but
always
worse
and
they
are
led
on
in
the
ways
of
evil
but
they
do
not
feel
the
punishment
until
they
begin
to
find
out
where
they
are
and
to
struggle
and
wish
for
other
things
the
little
pilgrim
felt
her
heart
beat
very
wildly
while
she
looked
at
this
and
she
thought
upon
the
rich
man
in
the
parable
who
though
he
was
himself
in
torment
prayed
that
his
brother
might
be
saved
and
she
said
to
herself
our
dear
lord
would
never
leave
him
there
who
could
think
of
his
brother
when
he
was
himself
in
such
a
strait
and
when
she
looked
at
the
painter
he
smiled
upon
her
and
nodded
his
head
then
he
led
her
to
the
other
corner
of
the
room
where
there
were
other
pictures
one
of
them
was
of
a
party
seated
round
a
table
and
an
angel
looking
on
the
angel
had
the
aspect
of
a
traveller
as
if
he
were
passing
quickly
by
and
had
but
paused
a
moment
to
look
and
one
of
the
men
glancing
up
suddenly
saw
him
the
picture
was
dim
but
the
startled
look
upon
this
man
face
and
the
sorrow
on
the
angel
appeared
out
of
the
misty
background
with
such
truth
that
the
tears
came
into
the
little
pilgrim
eyes
and
she
said
in
her
heart
oh
that
i
could
go
to
him
and
help
him
the
other
sketches
were
dimmer
and
dimmer
you
seemed
to
see
out
of
the
darkness
gleaming
lights
and
companies
of
revellers
out
of
which
here
and
there
was
one
trying
to
escape
and
then
the
wide
plains
in
the
night
and
the
white
vision
of
the
angel
in
the
distance
and
here
and
there
by
different
paths
a
fugitive
striving
to
follow
oh
sir
said
the
little
pilgrim
how
did
you
learn
to
do
it
you
have
never
been
there
it
was
the
master
not
i
and
i
can
not
tell
you
if
he
has
ever
been
there
when
the
father
has
given
you
that
gift
you
can
go
to
many
places
without
leaving
the
one
where
you
are
and
then
he
has
heard
what
the
angels
say
and
will
they
all
get
safe
at
the
last
and
even
that
great
spirit
he
that
fell
from
heaven
the
painter
shook
his
head
and
said
it
is
not
permitted
to
you
and
me
to
know
such
great
things
perhaps
the
wise
will
tell
you
if
you
ask
them
but
for
me
i
ask
the
father
in
my
heart
and
listen
to
what
he
says
that
is
best
the
little
pilgrim
said
and
she
asked
the
father
in
her
heart
and
there
came
all
over
her
such
a
glow
of
warmth
and
happiness
that
her
soul
was
satisfied
she
looked
in
the
painter
face
and
laughed
for
joy
and
he
put
out
his
hands
as
if
welcoming
some
one
and
his
countenance
shone
and
he
said
my
son
had
a
great
gift
he
was
a
master
born
though
it
was
not
given
to
me
he
shall
paint
it
all
for
us
so
that
the
heart
shall
rejoice
and
you
will
come
again
and
see
after
that
it
happened
to
the
little
pilgrim
to
enter
into
another
great
palace
where
there
were
many
people
reading
and
some
sitting
at
their
desks
and
writing
and
some
consulting
together
with
many
great
volumes
stretched
out
open
upon
the
tables
one
of
these
who
was
seated
alone
looked
up
as
she
paused
wondering
at
him
and
smiled
as
every
one
did
and
greeted
her
with
such
a
friendly
tone
that
the
pilgrim
who
always
had
a
great
desire
to
know
came
nearer
to
him
and
looked
at
the
book
then
begged
his
pardon
and
said
she
did
not
know
that
books
were
needed
here
and
then
he
told
her
that
he
was
one
of
the
historians
of
the
city
where
all
the
records
of
the
world
were
kept
and
that
it
was
his
business
to
work
upon
the
great
history
and
to
show
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
father
in
everything
that
had
happened
and
how
each
event
came
in
its
right
place
and
do
you
get
it
out
of
books
she
asked
for
she
was
not
learned
nor
wise
and
knew
but
little
though
she
always
loved
to
know
the
books
are
the
records
he
said
and
there
are
many
here
that
were
never
known
to
us
in
the
old
days
for
the
angels
love
to
look
into
these
things
and
they
can
tell
us
much
for
they
saw
it
and
in
the
great
books
they
have
kept
there
is
much
put
down
that
was
never
in
the
books
we
wrote
for
then
we
did
not
know
we
found
out
about
the
kings
and
the
state
and
tried
to
understand
what
great
purposes
they
were
serving
but
even
these
we
did
not
know
for
those
purposes
were
too
great
for
us
not
knowing
the
end
from
the
beginning
and
the
hearts
of
men
were
too
great
for
us
we
comprehended
the
evil
sometimes
but
never
fathomed
the
good
and
how
could
we
know
the
lesser
things
which
were
working
out
god
way
for
some
of
these
even
the
angels
did
not
know
and
it
has
happened
to
me
that
our
lord
himself
has
come
in
sometimes
to
tell
me
of
one
that
none
of
us
had
discovered
oh
said
the
little
pilgrim
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
should
like
to
have
been
that
one
that
was
not
known
even
to
the
angels
but
only
to
himself
the
historian
smiled
it
was
my
brother
he
said
the
pilgrim
looked
at
him
with
great
wonder
your
brother
and
you
did
not
know
him
and
then
he
turned
over
the
pages
and
showed
her
where
the
story
was
you
know
he
said
that
we
who
live
here
are
not
of
your
time
but
have
lived
and
lived
here
till
the
old
life
is
far
away
and
like
a
dream
there
were
great
tumults
and
fightings
in
our
time
and
it
was
settled
by
the
prince
of
the
place
that
our
town
was
to
be
abandoned
and
all
the
people
left
to
the
mercy
of
an
enemy
who
had
no
mercy
but
every
day
as
he
rode
out
he
saw
at
one
door
a
child
a
little
fair
boy
who
sat
on
the
steps
and
sang
his
little
song
like
a
bird
this
child
was
never
afraid
of
anything
when
the
horses
pranced
past
him
and
the
troopers
pushed
him
aside
he
looked
up
into
their
faces
and
smiled
and
when
he
had
anything
a
piece
of
bread
or
an
apple
or
a
plaything
he
shared
it
with
his
playmates
and
his
little
face
and
his
pretty
voice
and
all
his
pleasant
ways
made
that
corner
bright
he
was
like
a
flower
growing
there
everybody
smiled
that
saw
him
i
have
seen
such
a
child
the
little
pilgrim
said
but
we
made
no
account
of
him
said
the
historian
the
lord
of
the
place
came
past
him
every
day
and
always
saw
him
singing
in
the
sun
by
his
father
door
and
it
was
a
wonder
then
and
it
has
been
a
wonder
ever
since
why
having
resolved
upon
it
that
prince
did
not
abandon
the
town
which
would
have
changed
all
his
fortune
after
much
had
been
made
clear
to
me
since
i
began
to
study
but
not
this
till
the
lord
himself
came
to
me
and
told
me
the
prince
looked
at
the
child
till
he
loved
him
and
he
reflected
how
many
children
there
were
like
this
that
would
be
murdered
or
starved
to
death
and
he
could
not
give
up
the
little
singing
boy
to
the
sword
so
he
remained
and
the
town
was
saved
and
he
became
a
great
king
it
was
so
secret
that
even
the
angels
did
not
know
it
but
without
that
child
the
history
would
not
have
been
complete
and
is
he
here
the
little
pilgrim
said
ah
said
the
historian
that
is
more
strange
still
for
that
which
saved
him
was
also
to
his
harm
he
is
not
here
he
is
elsewhere
the
little
pilgrim
face
grew
sad
but
then
she
remembered
what
she
had
been
told
but
you
know
she
said
that
he
is
coming
i
know
that
our
father
will
never
forsake
him
and
that
everything
that
is
being
accomplished
in
him
is
well
is
it
well
to
suffer
is
it
well
to
live
in
that
dark
stormy
country
oh
that
they
were
all
here
and
happy
like
you
he
shook
his
head
a
little
and
said
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
got
here
and
as
for
suffering
that
matters
little
you
get
experience
by
it
you
are
more
accomplished
and
fit
for
greater
work
in
the
end
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
we
are
permitted
to
wander
and
sometimes
one
goes
to
the
edge
of
despair
she
looked
at
him
with
such
wondering
eyes
that
he
answered
her
without
a
word
yes
he
said
i
have
been
there
and
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
something
in
his
eyes
which
she
had
not
remarked
before
not
only
the
great
content
that
was
everywhere
but
a
deeper
light
and
the
air
of
a
judge
who
knew
both
good
and
evil
and
could
see
both
sides
and
understood
all
both
to
love
and
to
hate
little
sister
he
said
you
have
never
wandered
far
it
is
not
needful
for
such
as
you
love
teaches
you
and
you
need
no
more
but
when
we
have
to
be
trained
for
an
office
like
this
to
make
the
way
of
the
lord
clear
through
all
the
generations
reason
is
that
we
should
see
everything
and
learn
all
that
man
is
and
can
be
these
things
are
too
deep
for
us
we
stumble
on
and
know
not
till
after
but
now
to
me
it
is
all
clear
she
looked
at
him
again
and
again
while
he
spoke
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
saw
in
him
such
great
knowledge
and
tenderness
as
made
her
glad
and
how
he
could
understand
the
follies
that
men
had
done
and
fathom
what
real
meaning
was
in
them
and
disentangle
all
the
threads
he
smiled
as
she
gazed
at
him
and
answered
as
if
she
had
spoken
what
was
evil
perishes
and
what
was
good
remains
almost
everywhere
there
is
a
little
good
we
could
not
understand
all
if
we
had
not
seen
all
and
shared
all
and
the
punishment
too
she
said
wondering
more
and
more
he
smiled
so
joyfully
that
it
was
like
laughter
pain
is
a
great
angel
he
said
the
reason
we
hated
him
in
the
old
days
was
because
he
tended
to
death
and
decay
but
when
it
is
towards
life
he
leads
we
fear
him
no
more
the
welcome
thing
of
all
in
the
land
of
darkness
is
when
you
see
him
first
and
know
who
he
is
for
by
this
you
are
aware
that
you
have
found
the
way
the
little
pilgrim
did
nothing
but
question
with
her
anxious
eyes
for
this
was
such
a
wonder
to
her
and
she
could
not
understand
but
he
only
sat
musing
with
a
smile
over
the
things
he
remembered
and
at
last
he
said
if
this
is
so
interesting
to
you
you
shall
read
it
all
in
another
place
in
the
room
where
we
have
laid
up
our
own
experiences
in
order
to
serve
for
the
history
afterwards
but
we
are
still
busy
upon
the
work
of
the
earth
there
is
always
something
new
to
be
discovered
and
it
is
essential
for
the
whole
world
that
the
chronicle
should
be
full
i
am
in
great
joy
because
it
was
but
just
now
that
our
lord
told
me
about
that
child
everything
was
imperfect
without
him
but
now
it
is
clear
you
mean
your
brother
and
you
are
happy
though
you
are
not
sure
if
he
is
happy
the
little
pilgrim
said
it
is
not
to
be
happy
that
we
live
said
he
and
then
we
are
all
happy
so
soon
as
we
have
found
the
way
she
would
have
asked
him
more
but
that
he
was
called
to
a
consultation
with
some
others
of
his
kind
and
had
to
leave
her
waving
his
hand
to
her
with
a
tender
kindness
which
went
to
her
heart
she
looked
after
him
with
great
respect
scarcely
knowing
why
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
man
who
had
been
in
the
land
of
darkness
and
made
his
way
out
of
it
must
be
more
wonderful
than
any
other
she
looked
round
for
a
little
upon
the
great
library
full
of
all
the
books
that
had
ever
been
written
and
where
people
were
doing
their
work
examining
and
reading
and
making
extracts
every
one
with
looks
of
so
much
interest
that
she
almost
envied
them
though
it
was
a
generous
delight
in
seeing
people
so
happy
in
their
occupation
and
a
desire
to
associate
herself
somehow
in
it
rather
than
any
grudging
of
their
satisfaction
that
was
in
her
mind
she
went
about
all
the
courts
of
this
palace
alone
and
everywhere
saw
the
same
work
going
on
and
everywhere
met
the
same
kind
looks
even
when
the
greatest
of
all
looked
up
from
his
work
and
saw
her
he
would
give
her
a
friendly
greeting
and
a
smile
and
nobody
was
too
wise
to
lend
an
ear
to
the
little
visitor
or
to
answer
her
questions
and
this
was
how
it
was
that
she
began
to
talk
to
another
who
was
seated
at
a
great
table
with
many
more
and
who
drew
her
to
him
by
something
that
was
in
his
looks
though
she
could
not
have
told
what
it
was
it
was
not
that
he
was
kinder
than
the
rest
for
they
were
all
kind
she
stood
by
him
a
little
and
saw
how
he
worked
and
would
take
something
from
one
book
and
something
from
another
putting
them
ready
for
use
and
it
did
not
seem
any
trouble
to
do
this
work
but
only
pleasure
and
the
very
pen
in
his
hand
was
like
a
winged
thing
as
if
it
loved
to
write
when
he
saw
her
watching
him
he
looked
up
and
showed
her
the
beautiful
book
out
of
which
he
was
copying
which
was
all
illuminated
with
lovely
pictures
this
is
one
of
the
volumes
of
the
great
history
he
said
there
are
some
things
in
it
which
are
needed
for
another
and
it
is
a
pleasure
to
work
at
it
if
you
will
come
here
you
will
be
able
to
see
the
page
while
i
write
then
the
little
pilgrim
asked
him
some
questions
about
the
pictures
and
he
answered
her
describing
and
explaining
them
for
they
were
in
the
middle
of
the
history
and
she
did
not
understand
what
it
was
when
she
said
i
ought
not
to
trouble
you
for
you
are
busy
he
laughed
so
kindly
that
she
laughed
too
for
pleasure
and
he
said
there
is
no
trouble
here
when
we
are
not
allowed
to
work
as
sometimes
happens
that
makes
us
not
quite
so
happy
but
it
is
very
seldom
that
it
happens
so
is
it
for
punishment
she
said
and
then
he
laughed
out
with
a
sound
which
made
all
the
others
look
up
smiling
and
if
they
had
not
all
looked
so
tenderly
at
her
as
at
a
child
who
has
made
such
a
mistake
as
it
is
pretty
for
the
child
to
make
she
would
have
feared
she
had
said
something
wrong
but
she
only
laughed
at
herself
too
and
blushed
a
little
knowing
that
she
was
not
wise
and
to
put
her
at
her
ease
again
he
turned
the
leaf
and
showed
her
other
pictures
and
the
story
which
went
with
them
from
which
he
was
copying
something
and
he
said
this
is
for
another
book
to
show
how
the
grace
of
the
father
was
beautiful
in
some
homes
and
families
it
is
not
the
great
history
but
connected
with
it
and
there
are
many
who
love
that
better
than
the
story
which
is
more
great
then
the
pilgrim
looked
in
his
face
and
said
what
i
want
most
is
to
know
about
your
homes
here
it
is
all
home
here
he
said
and
smiled
and
then
as
he
met
her
wistful
looks
he
went
on
to
tell
her
that
he
and
his
brothers
were
not
always
there
we
have
all
our
occupations
he
said
and
sometimes
i
am
sent
to
inquire
into
facts
that
have
happened
of
which
the
record
is
not
clear
for
we
must
omit
nothing
and
sometimes
we
are
told
to
rest
and
take
in
new
strength
and
sometimes
but
oh
forgive
me
cried
the
little
pilgrim
you
had
some
who
were
more
dear
to
you
than
all
the
world
in
the
old
time
and
the
others
all
looked
up
again
at
the
question
and
looked
at
her
with
tender
eyes
and
said
to
the
man
whom
she
questioned
speak
he
made
a
little
pause
before
he
spoke
and
he
looked
at
one
here
and
there
and
called
to
them
patience
brother
and
courage
brother
and
then
he
said
those
whom
we
loved
best
are
nearly
all
with
us
but
some
have
not
yet
come
oh
said
the
little
pilgrim
but
how
then
do
you
bear
it
to
be
parted
so
long
so
long
then
one
of
those
to
whom
the
first
speaker
had
called
out
patience
rose
and
came
to
her
smiling
and
he
said
i
think
every
hour
that
perhaps
she
will
come
and
the
joy
will
be
so
great
that
thinking
of
that
makes
the
waiting
short
and
nothing
here
is
long
for
it
never
ends
and
it
will
be
so
wonderful
to
hear
her
tell
how
the
father
has
guided
her
that
it
will
be
a
delight
to
us
all
and
she
will
be
able
to
explain
many
things
not
only
for
us
but
for
all
and
we
love
each
other
so
that
this
separation
is
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
what
is
to
come
it
was
beautiful
to
hear
this
but
it
was
not
what
the
little
pilgrim
expected
for
she
thought
they
would
have
told
her
of
the
homes
to
which
they
all
returned
when
their
work
was
over
and
a
life
which
was
like
the
life
of
the
old
time
but
of
this
they
said
nothing
only
looking
at
her
with
smiling
eyes
as
at
the
curious
questions
of
a
child
and
there
were
many
other
things
she
would
have
asked
but
refrained
when
she
looked
at
them
feeling
as
if
she
did
not
yet
understand
when
one
of
them
broke
forth
suddenly
in
a
louder
voice
and
said
the
little
sister
knows
only
the
little
language
and
the
beginning
of
days
she
has
not
learned
the
mysteries
and
what
love
is
and
what
life
is
and
another
cried
it
is
sweet
to
hear
it
again
and
they
all
gathered
round
her
with
tender
looks
and
began
to
talk
to
each
other
and
tell
her
as
men
will
tell
of
the
games
of
their
childhood
of
things
that
happened
which
were
in
the
old
time
after
this
the
little
pilgrim
went
out
again
into
the
beautiful
city
feeling
in
her
heart
that
everything
was
a
mystery
and
that
the
days
would
never
be
long
enough
to
learn
all
that
had
yet
to
be
learned
but
knowing
now
that
this
too
was
the
little
language
and
pleased
with
the
sweet
thought
of
so
much
that
was
to
come
for
one
had
whispered
to
her
as
she
went
out
that
the
new
tongue
and
every
explanation
as
she
was
ready
for
it
would
come
to
her
through
one
of
those
whom
she
loved
best
which
is
the
usage
of
that
country
and
when
the
stranger
has
no
one
there
that
is
very
dear
then
it
is
an
angel
who
teaches
the
greater
language
and
that
is
what
happens
often
to
the
children
who
are
brought
up
in
that
heavenly
place
when
she
reached
the
street
again
she
was
so
pleased
with
this
thought
that
it
went
out
of
her
mind
to
ask
her
way
to
the
great
library
where
she
was
to
read
the
story
of
the
historian
journey
through
the
land
of
darkness
indeed
she
forgot
that
land
altogether
and
thought
only
of
what
was
around
her
in
the
great
city
which
is
beyond
everything
that
eye
has
seen
or
that
ear
has
heard
or
that
it
has
entered
into
the
imagination
to
conceive
and
now
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
much
more
familiar
with
the
looks
of
the
people
and
could
distinguish
between
those
who
belonged
to
the
city
and
those
who
were
visitors
like
herself
and
also
could
tell
which
they
were
who
had
entered
into
the
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
and
which
were
like
herself
only
acquainted
with
the
beginning
of
days
and
it
came
to
her
mind
she
could
not
tell
how
that
it
was
best
not
to
ask
questions
but
to
wait
until
the
beloved
one
should
come
who
would
teach
her
the
first
words
for
in
the
mean
time
she
did
not
feel
at
all
impatient
or
disturbed
by
her
want
of
knowledge
but
laughed
a
little
at
herself
to
suppose
that
she
could
find
out
everything
and
went
on
looking
round
her
and
saying
a
word
to
every
one
she
met
and
enjoying
the
holiday
looks
of
all
the
strangers
and
the
sense
she
had
in
her
heart
of
holiday
too
she
was
walking
on
in
this
pleasant
way
when
she
heard
a
sound
that
was
like
silver
trumpets
and
saw
the
crowd
turn
towards
an
open
space
in
which
all
the
beautiful
buildings
were
shaded
with
fine
trees
and
flowers
were
springing
at
the
very
edge
of
the
pavements
the
strangers
all
hastened
along
to
hear
what
it
was
and
she
with
them
and
some
also
of
the
people
of
the
place
and
as
the
little
pilgrim
found
herself
walking
by
a
woman
who
was
of
these
last
she
asked
her
what
it
was
and
the
woman
told
her
it
was
a
poet
who
had
come
to
say
to
them
what
had
been
revealed
to
him
and
that
the
two
with
the
silver
trumpets
were
angels
of
the
musicians
order
whose
office
it
was
to
proclaim
everything
that
was
new
that
the
people
should
know
and
many
of
those
who
were
at
work
in
the
palaces
came
out
and
joined
the
crowd
and
the
painter
who
had
showed
the
little
pilgrim
his
picture
and
many
whose
faces
she
began
to
be
acquainted
with
the
poet
stood
up
upon
a
beautiful
pedestal
all
sculptured
in
stone
and
with
wreaths
of
living
flowers
hung
upon
it
and
when
the
crowd
had
gathered
in
front
of
him
he
began
his
poem
he
told
them
that
it
was
not
about
this
land
or
anything
that
happened
in
it
which
they
knew
as
he
did
but
that
it
was
a
story
of
the
old
time
when
men
were
walking
in
darkness
and
when
no
one
knew
the
true
meaning
even
of
what
he
himself
did
but
had
to
go
on
as
if
blindly
stumbling
and
groping
with
their
hands
and
oh
brethren
he
said
though
all
is
more
beautiful
and
joyful
here
where
we
know
yet
to
remember
the
days
when
we
knew
not
and
the
ways
when
all
was
uncertain
and
the
end
could
not
be
distinguished
from
the
beginning
is
sweet
and
dear
and
that
which
was
done
in
the
dim
twilight
should
be
celebrated
in
the
day
and
our
father
himself
loves
to
hear
of
those
who
having
not
seen
loved
and
who
learned
without
any
teacher
and
followed
the
light
though
they
did
not
understand
and
then
he
told
them
the
story
of
one
who
had
lived
in
the
old
time
and
in
that
air
which
seemed
to
be
made
of
sunshine
and
amid
all
those
stately
palaces
he
described
to
them
the
little
earth
which
they
had
left
behind
the
skies
that
were
covered
with
clouds
and
the
ways
that
were
so
rough
and
stony
and
the
cruelty
of
the
oppressor
and
the
cries
of
those
that
were
oppressed
and
he
showed
the
sickness
and
the
troubles
and
the
sorrow
and
danger
and
how
death
stalked
about
and
tore
heart
from
heart
and
how
sometimes
the
strongest
would
fail
and
the
truest
fall
under
the
power
of
a
lie
and
the
tenderest
forget
to
be
kind
and
how
evil
things
lurked
in
every
corner
to
beguile
the
dwellers
there
and
how
the
days
were
short
and
the
nights
dark
and
life
so
little
that
by
the
time
a
man
had
learned
something
it
was
his
hour
to
die
what
can
a
soul
do
that
is
born
there
he
cried
for
war
is
there
and
fighting
and
perplexity
and
darkness
and
no
man
knows
if
that
which
he
does
will
be
for
good
or
evil
or
can
tell
which
is
the
best
way
or
know
the
end
from
the
beginning
and
those
he
loves
the
most
are
a
mystery
to
him
and
their
thoughts
beyond
his
reach
and
clouds
are
between
him
and
the
father
and
he
is
deceived
with
false
gods
and
false
teachers
who
make
him
to
love
a
lie
the
people
who
were
listening
held
their
breath
and
a
shadow
like
a
cloud
fell
on
them
and
they
remembered
and
knew
that
it
was
true
but
the
next
moment
their
hearts
rebelled
and
one
and
another
would
have
spoken
and
the
little
pilgrim
herself
had
almost
cried
out
and
made
her
plea
for
the
dear
earth
which
she
loved
when
he
suddenly
threw
forth
his
voice
again
like
a
great
song
oh
dear
mother
earth
he
cried
oh
little
world
and
great
forgive
thy
son
for
lovely
thou
art
and
dear
and
the
sun
of
god
shines
upon
thee
and
the
sweet
dews
fall
and
there
were
we
born
and
loved
and
died
and
are
come
hence
to
bless
the
father
and
the
son
for
in
no
other
world
though
they
are
so
vast
is
it
given
to
any
to
know
the
lord
in
the
darkness
and
follow
him
groping
and
make
way
through
sin
and
death
and
overcome
the
evil
and
conquer
in
his
name
at
which
there
was
a
great
sound
of
weeping
and
of
triumph
and
the
little
pilgrim
could
not
contain
herself
but
cried
out
too
in
joy
as
if
for
a
deliverance
and
then
the
poet
told
his
tale
and
as
he
told
them
of
the
man
who
was
poor
and
sorrowful
and
alone
and
how
he
loved
and
was
not
loved
again
and
trusted
and
was
betrayed
and
was
tempted
and
drawn
into
the
darkness
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
perish
but
when
hope
was
almost
gone
turned
again
from
the
edge
of
despair
and
confronted
all
his
enemies
and
fought
and
conquered
the
people
followed
every
word
with
great
outcries
of
love
and
pity
and
wonder
for
each
one
as
he
listened
remembered
his
own
career
and
that
of
his
brethren
in
the
old
life
and
admired
to
think
that
all
the
evil
was
past
and
wondered
that
out
of
such
tribulation
and
through
so
many
dangers
all
were
safe
and
blessed
here
and
there
were
others
that
were
not
of
them
who
listened
some
seated
at
the
windows
of
the
palaces
and
some
standing
in
the
great
square
people
who
were
not
like
the
others
whose
bearing
was
more
majestic
and
who
looked
upon
the
crowd
all
smiling
and
weeping
with
wonder
and
interest
but
had
no
knowledge
of
the
cause
and
listened
as
it
were
to
a
tale
that
is
told
the
poet
and
his
audience
were
as
one
and
at
every
period
of
the
story
there
was
a
deep
breathing
and
pause
and
every
one
looked
at
his
neighbor
and
some
grasped
each
other
hands
as
they
remembered
all
that
was
in
the
past
but
the
strangers
listened
and
gazed
and
observed
all
as
those
who
listen
and
are
instructed
in
something
beyond
their
knowledge
the
little
pilgrim
stood
all
this
time
not
knowing
where
she
was
so
intent
was
she
upon
the
tale
and
as
she
listened
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
her
own
life
was
rolling
out
before
her
and
she
remembered
the
things
that
had
been
and
perceived
how
all
had
been
shaped
and
guided
and
trembled
a
little
for
the
brother
who
was
in
danger
yet
knew
that
all
would
be
well
the
woman
who
had
been
at
her
side
listened
too
with
all
her
heart
saying
to
herself
as
she
stood
in
the
crowd
he
has
left
nothing
out
the
little
days
they
were
so
short
and
the
skies
would
change
all
in
a
moment
and
one
heart
with
them
how
he
brings
it
all
back
and
she
put
up
her
hand
to
dry
away
a
tear
from
her
eyes
though
her
face
all
the
time
was
shining
with
the
recollection
the
little
pilgrim
was
glad
to
be
by
the
side
of
a
woman
after
talking
with
so
many
men
and
she
put
out
her
hand
and
touched
the
cloak
that
this
lady
wore
and
which
was
white
and
of
the
most
beautiful
texture
with
gold
threads
woven
in
it
or
something
that
looked
like
gold
do
you
like
she
said
to
think
of
the
old
time
the
woman
turned
and
looked
down
upon
her
for
she
was
tall
and
stately
and
immediately
took
the
hand
of
the
little
pilgrim
into
hers
and
held
it
without
answering
till
the
poet
had
ended
and
come
down
from
the
place
where
he
had
been
standing
he
came
straight
through
the
crowd
to
where
this
lady
stood
and
said
something
to
her
you
did
well
to
tell
me
looking
at
her
with
love
in
his
eyes
not
the
tender
sweetness
of
all
those
kind
looks
around
but
the
love
that
is
for
one
the
little
pilgrim
looked
at
them
with
her
heart
beating
and
was
very
glad
for
them
and
happy
in
herself
for
she
had
not
seen
this
love
before
since
she
came
into
the
city
and
it
had
troubled
her
to
think
that
perhaps
it
did
not
exist
any
more
i
am
glad
the
lady
said
and
gave
him
her
other
hand
but
here
is
a
little
sister
who
asks
me
something
and
i
must
answer
her
i
think
she
has
but
newly
come
she
has
a
face
full
of
the
morning
the
poet
said
it
did
the
little
pilgrim
good
to
feel
the
touch
of
the
warm
soft
hand
and
she
was
not
afraid
but
lifted
her
eyes
and
spoke
to
the
lady
and
to
the
poet
it
is
beautiful
what
you
said
to
us
sometimes
in
the
old
time
we
used
to
look
up
to
the
beautiful
skies
and
wonder
what
there
was
above
the
clouds
but
we
never
thought
that
up
here
in
this
great
city
you
would
be
thinking
of
what
we
were
doing
and
making
beautiful
poems
all
about
us
we
thought
that
you
would
sing
wonderful
psalms
and
talk
of
things
high
high
above
us
the
little
sister
does
not
know
what
the
meaning
of
the
earth
is
the
poet
said
it
is
but
a
little
speck
but
it
is
the
centre
of
all
let
her
walk
with
us
and
we
will
go
home
and
you
will
tell
her
ama
for
i
love
to
hear
you
talk
will
you
come
with
us
the
lady
said
and
the
little
pilgrim
heart
leaped
up
in
her
to
think
she
was
now
going
to
see
a
home
in
this
wonderful
city
and
they
went
along
hand
in
hand
and
though
they
were
three
together
and
many
were
coming
and
going
there
was
no
difficulty
for
every
one
made
way
for
them
and
there
was
a
little
murmur
of
pleasure
as
the
poet
passed
and
those
who
had
heard
his
poem
made
obeisance
to
him
and
thanked
him
and
thanked
the
father
for
him
that
he
was
able
to
show
them
so
many
beautiful
things
and
they
walked
along
the
street
which
was
shining
with
color
and
saw
as
they
passed
how
the
master
painter
had
come
to
his
work
and
was
standing
upon
the
balcony
where
the
little
pilgrim
had
been
and
bringing
out
of
the
wall
under
his
hand
faces
which
were
full
of
life
and
which
seemed
to
spring
forth
as
if
they
had
been
hidden
there
let
us
wait
a
little
and
see
him
working
the
poet
said
and
all
round
about
the
people
stopped
on
their
way
and
there
was
a
soft
cry
of
pleasure
and
praise
all
through
the
beautiful
street
and
the
painter
with
whom
the
little
pilgrim
had
talked
before
came
and
stood
behind
her
as
if
he
had
been
an
old
friend
and
called
out
to
her
at
every
new
touch
to
mark
how
this
and
that
was
done
she
did
not
understand
as
he
did
but
she
saw
how
beautiful
it
was
and
she
was
glad
to
have
seen
the
great
painter
as
she
had
been
glad
to
hear
the
great
poet
it
seemed
to
the
little
pilgrim
as
if
everything
happened
well
for
her
and
that
no
one
had
ever
been
so
blessed
before
and
to
make
it
all
more
sweet
this
new
friend
this
great
and
sweet
lady
always
held
her
hand
and
pressed
it
softly
when
something
more
lovely
appeared
and
even
the
pictured
faces
on
the
wall
seemed
to
beam
upon
her
as
they
came
out
one
by
one
like
the
stars
in
the
sky
then
the
three
went
on
again
and
passed
by
many
more
beautiful
palaces
and
great
streets
leading
away
into
the
light
till
you
could
see
no
further
and
they
met
with
bands
of
singers
who
sang
so
sweetly
that
the
heart
seemed
to
leap
out
of
the
pilgrim
breast
to
meet
with
them
for
above
all
things
this
was
what
she
had
loved
most
and
out
of
one
of
the
palaces
there
came
such
glorious
music
that
everything
she
had
seen
and
heard
before
seemed
as
nothing
in
comparison
and
amid
all
these
delights
they
went
on
and
on
but
without
wearying
till
they
came
out
of
the
streets
into
lovely
walks
and
alleys
and
made
their
way
to
the
banks
of
a
great
river
which
seemed
to
sing
too
a
soft
melody
of
its
own
and
here
there
were
some
fair
houses
surrounded
by
gardens
and
flowers
that
grew
everywhere
and
the
doors
were
all
open
and
within
everything
was
lovely
and
still
and
ready
for
rest
if
you
were
weary
the
little
pilgrim
was
not
weary
but
the
lady
placed
her
upon
a
couch
in
the
porch
where
the
pillars
and
the
roof
were
all
formed
of
interlacing
plants
and
flowers
and
there
they
sat
with
her
and
talked
and
explained
to
her
many
things
they
told
her
that
the
earth
though
so
small
was
the
place
in
all
the
world
to
which
the
thoughts
of
those
above
were
turned
and
not
only
of
us
who
have
lived
there
but
of
all
our
brothers
in
the
other
worlds
for
we
are
the
race
which
the
father
has
chosen
to
be
the
example
in
every
age
there
is
one
that
is
the
scene
of
the
struggle
and
the
victory
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
chronicles
are
made
and
that
we
are
all
placed
here
to
gather
the
meaning
of
what
has
been
done
among
men
and
i
am
one
of
those
the
lady
said
that
go
back
to
the
dear
earth
and
gather
up
the
tale
of
what
our
little
brethren
are
doing
i
have
not
to
succor
like
some
others
but
only
to
see
and
bring
the
news
and
he
makes
them
into
great
poems
as
you
have
heard
and
sometimes
the
master
painter
will
take
one
and
make
of
it
a
picture
and
there
is
nothing
that
is
so
delightful
to
us
as
when
we
can
bring
back
the
histories
of
beautiful
things
but
oh
said
the
little
pilgrim
what
can
there
be
on
earth
so
beautiful
as
the
meanest
thing
that
is
here
then
they
both
smiled
upon
her
and
said
it
is
more
beautiful
than
the
most
beautiful
thing
here
to
see
how
under
the
low
skies
and
in
the
short
days
a
soul
will
turn
to
our
father
and
sometimes
said
ama
when
i
am
watching
one
will
wander
and
stray
and
be
led
into
the
dark
till
my
heart
is
sick
then
come
back
and
make
me
glad
sometimes
i
cry
out
within
myself
to
the
father
and
say
my
father
it
is
enough
and
it
will
seem
to
me
that
it
is
not
possible
to
stand
by
and
see
his
destruction
and
then
while
you
are
gazing
while
you
are
crying
he
will
recover
and
return
and
go
on
again
and
to
the
angels
it
is
more
wonderful
than
to
us
for
they
have
never
lived
there
and
all
the
other
worlds
are
eager
to
hear
what
we
can
tell
them
for
no
one
knows
except
the
father
how
the
battle
will
turn
or
when
it
will
all
be
accomplished
and
there
are
some
who
tremble
for
our
little
brethren
for
to
look
down
and
see
how
little
light
there
is
and
how
no
one
knows
what
may
happen
to
him
next
makes
them
afraid
who
never
were
there
the
little
pilgrim
listened
with
an
intent
face
clasping
her
hands
and
said
but
it
never
could
be
that
our
father
should
be
overcome
by
evil
is
not
that
known
in
all
the
worlds
then
the
lady
turned
and
kissed
her
and
the
poet
broke
forth
in
singing
and
said
faith
is
more
heavenly
than
heaven
it
is
more
beautiful
than
the
angels
it
is
the
only
voice
that
can
answer
to
our
father
we
praise
him
we
glorify
him
we
love
his
name
but
there
is
but
one
response
to
him
through
all
the
worlds
and
that
is
the
cry
of
the
little
brothers
who
see
nothing
and
know
nothing
but
believe
that
he
will
never
fail
at
this
the
little
pilgrim
wept
for
her
heart
was
touched
but
she
said
we
are
not
so
ignorant
for
we
have
our
lord
who
is
our
brother
and
he
teaches
us
all
that
we
require
to
know
upon
this
the
poet
rose
and
lifted
up
his
hands
and
sang
again
a
great
song
it
was
in
the
other
language
which
the
little
pilgrim
still
did
not
understand
but
she
could
make
out
that
it
sounded
like
a
great
proclamation
that
he
was
wise
as
he
was
good
and
called
upon
all
to
see
that
the
lord
had
chosen
the
only
way
and
the
sound
of
the
poet
voice
was
like
a
great
trumpet
sounding
bold
and
sweet
as
if
to
tell
this
to
those
who
were
far
away
for
you
must
know
said
the
lady
ama
who
all
the
time
held
the
pilgrim
hand
that
it
is
permitted
to
all
to
judge
according
to
the
wisdom
that
has
been
given
them
and
there
are
some
who
think
that
our
dear
lord
might
have
found
another
way
and
that
wait
sometimes
with
trembling
lest
he
should
fail
but
not
among
us
who
have
lived
on
earth
for
we
know
and
it
is
our
work
to
show
to
all
the
worlds
that
his
way
never
fails
and
how
wonderful
it
is
and
beautiful
above
all
that
heart
has
conceived
and
thus
we
justify
the
ways
of
god
who
is
our
father
but
in
the
other
worlds
there
are
many
who
will
continue
to
fear
until
the
history
of
the
earth
is
all
ended
and
the
chronicles
are
made
complete
and
will
that
be
long
the
little
pilgrim
cried
feeling
in
her
heart
that
she
would
like
to
go
to
all
the
worlds
and
tell
them
of
our
lord
and
of
his
love
and
how
the
thought
of
him
makes
you
strong
and
it
troubled
her
a
little
to
hear
her
friends
speak
of
the
low
skies
and
the
short
days
and
the
dimness
of
that
dear
country
which
she
had
left
behind
in
which
there
were
so
many
still
whom
she
loved
upon
this
ama
shook
her
head
and
said
that
of
that
day
no
one
knew
not
even
our
lord
but
only
the
father
and
then
she
smiled
and
answered
the
little
pilgrim
thought
when
we
go
back
she
said
it
is
not
as
when
we
lived
there
for
now
we
see
all
the
dangers
of
it
and
the
mysteries
which
we
did
not
see
before
it
was
by
the
father
dear
love
that
we
did
not
see
what
was
around
us
and
about
us
while
we
lived
there
for
then
our
hearts
would
have
fainted
and
that
makes
us
wonder
now
that
any
one
endures
to
the
end
you
are
a
great
deal
wiser
than
i
am
said
the
little
pilgrim
but
though
our
hearts
had
fainted
how
could
we
have
been
overcome
for
he
was
on
our
side
at
this
neither
of
them
made
any
reply
at
first
but
looked
at
her
and
at
length
the
poet
said
that
she
had
brought
many
thoughts
back
to
his
mind
and
how
he
had
himself
been
almost
worsted
when
one
like
her
came
to
him
and
gave
strength
to
his
soul
for
that
he
was
on
our
side
was
the
only
thing
she
knew
he
said
and
all
that
could
be
learned
or
discovered
was
not
worthy
of
naming
beside
it
and
this
i
must
tell
when
next
i
speak
to
the
people
and
how
our
little
sister
brought
it
to
my
mind
and
then
they
paused
from
this
discourse
and
the
little
pilgrim
looked
round
upon
the
beautiful
houses
and
the
fair
gardens
and
she
said
you
live
here
and
do
you
come
home
at
night
but
i
do
not
mean
at
night
i
mean
when
your
work
is
done
and
are
they
poets
like
you
that
dwell
all
about
in
these
pleasant
places
and
the
she
would
have
said
the
children
but
stopped
not
knowing
if
perhaps
it
might
be
unkind
to
speak
of
the
children
when
she
saw
none
there
upon
this
the
lady
smiled
once
more
and
said
the
door
stands
open
always
so
that
no
one
is
shut
out
and
the
children
come
and
go
when
they
will
they
are
children
no
longer
and
they
have
their
appointed
work
like
him
and
me
and
you
are
always
among
those
you
love
the
pilgrim
said
upon
which
they
smiled
again
and
said
we
all
love
each
other
and
the
lady
held
her
hand
in
both
of
hers
and
caressed
it
and
softly
laughed
and
said
you
know
only
the
little
language
when
you
have
been
taught
the
other
you
will
learn
many
beautiful
things
she
rested
for
some
time
after
this
and
talked
much
with
her
new
friends
and
then
there
came
into
the
heart
of
the
little
pilgrim
a
longing
to
go
to
the
place
which
was
appointed
for
her
and
which
was
her
home
and
to
do
the
work
which
had
been
given
her
to
do
and
when
the
lady
saw
this
she
rose
and
said
that
she
would
accompany
her
a
little
upon
her
way
but
the
poet
bid
her
farewell
and
remained
under
the
porch
with
the
green
branches
shading
him
and
the
flowers
twining
round
the
pillars
and
the
open
door
of
this
beautiful
house
behind
him
when
she
looked
back
upon
him
he
waved
his
hand
to
her
as
if
bidding
her
and
the
lady
by
her
side
looked
back
too
and
waved
her
hand
and
the
little
pilgrim
felt
tears
of
happiness
come
to
her
eyes
for
she
had
been
wondering
with
a
little
disappointment
to
see
that
the
people
in
the
city
except
those
who
were
strangers
were
chiefly
alone
and
not
like
those
in
the
old
world
where
the
husband
and
wife
go
together
it
consoled
her
to
see
again
two
who
were
one
the
lady
pressed
her
hand
in
answer
to
her
thought
and
bade
her
pause
a
moment
and
look
back
into
the
city
as
they
passed
the
end
of
the
great
street
out
of
which
they
came
and
then
the
pilgrim
was
more
and
more
consoled
for
she
saw
many
who
had
before
been
alone
now
walking
together
hand
in
hand
it
is
not
as
it
was
ama
said
for
all
of
us
have
work
to
do
which
is
needed
for
the
worlds
and
it
is
no
longer
needful
that
one
should
sit
at
home
while
the
other
goes
forth
for
our
work
is
not
for
our
life
as
of
old
or
for
ourselves
but
for
the
father
who
has
given
us
so
great
a
trust
and
little
sister
you
must
know
that
though
we
are
not
so
great
as
the
angels
nor
as
many
that
come
to
visit
us
from
the
other
worlds
yet
we
are
nearer
to
him
for
we
are
in
his
secret
and
it
is
ours
to
make
it
clear
the
little
pilgrim
heart
was
very
full
to
hear
this
but
she
said
i
was
never
clever
nor
knew
much
it
is
better
for
me
to
go
away
to
my
little
and
help
the
strangers
who
do
not
know
the
way
whatever
is
your
work
is
the
best
the
lady
said
but
though
you
are
so
little
you
are
in
the
father
secret
too
for
it
is
nature
to
you
to
know
what
the
others
can
not
be
sure
of
that
we
must
have
the
victory
at
the
last
so
that
we
have
this
between
us
the
father
and
we
and
though
all
are
his
children
we
are
of
the
kindred
of
god
because
of
our
lord
who
is
our
brother
and
then
the
lady
ama
kissed
her
and
bade
her
when
she
returned
to
the
great
city
either
for
rest
or
for
love
or
because
the
father
sent
for
her
that
she
should
come
to
the
house
by
the
river
for
we
are
friends
for
ever
she
said
and
so
threw
her
white
veil
over
her
head
and
was
gone
upon
her
mission
whither
the
little
pilgrim
did
not
know
and
now
she
found
herself
at
a
distance
from
the
great
city
which
shone
in
the
light
with
its
beautiful
towers
and
roofs
and
all
its
monuments
softly
fringed
with
trees
and
set
in
a
heavenly
firmament
and
the
pilgrim
thought
of
those
words
that
described
this
lovely
place
as
a
bride
adorned
for
her
husband
and
did
not
wonder
at
him
who
had
said
that
her
streets
were
of
gold
and
her
gates
of
pearl
because
gold
and
pearls
and
precious
jewels
were
as
nothing
to
the
glory
and
the
beauty
of
her
the
little
pilgrim
was
glad
to
have
seen
these
wonderful
things
and
her
mind
was
like
a
cup
running
over
with
almost
more
than
it
could
contain
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
never
could
be
a
time
when
she
should
want
for
wonder
and
interest
and
delight
so
long
as
she
had
this
to
think
of
yet
she
was
not
sorry
to
turn
her
back
upon
the
beautiful
city
but
went
on
her
way
singing
in
unutterable
content
and
thinking
over
what
the
lady
had
said
that
we
were
in
god
secret
more
than
all
the
great
worlds
above
and
even
the
angels
because
of
knowing
how
it
is
that
in
darkness
and
doubt
and
without
any
open
vision
a
man
may
still
keep
the
right
way
the
path
lay
along
the
bank
of
the
river
which
flowed
beside
her
and
made
the
air
full
of
music
and
a
soft
air
blew
across
the
running
stream
and
breathed
in
her
face
and
refreshed
her
and
the
birds
sang
in
all
the
trees
and
as
she
passed
through
the
villages
the
people
came
out
to
meet
her
and
asked
of
her
if
she
had
come
from
the
city
and
what
she
had
seen
there
and
everywhere
she
found
friends
and
kind
voices
that
gave
her
greeting
but
some
would
ask
her
why
she
still
spoke
the
little
language
though
it
was
sweet
to
their
ears
and
others
when
they
heard
it
hastened
to
call
from
the
houses
and
the
fields
some
among
them
who
knew
the
other
tongue
but
a
little
and
who
came
and
crowded
round
the
little
pilgrim
and
asked
her
many
questions
both
about
the
things
she
had
been
seeing
and
about
the
old
time
and
she
perceived
that
the
village
folk
were
a
simple
folk
not
learned
and
wise
like
those
she
had
left
and
that
though
they
lived
within
sight
of
the
great
city
and
showed
every
stranger
the
beautiful
view
of
it
and
the
glory
of
its
towers
yet
few
among
them
had
travelled
there
for
they
were
so
content
with
their
fields
and
their
river
and
the
shade
of
their
trees
and
the
birds
singing
and
their
simple
life
that
they
wanted
no
change
though
it
pleased
them
to
receive
the
little
pilgrim
and
they
brought
her
into
their
villages
rejoicing
and
called
every
one
to
see
her
and
they
told
her
that
they
had
all
been
poor
and
labored
hard
in
the
old
time
and
had
never
rested
so
that
now
it
was
the
father
good
pleasure
that
they
should
enjoy
great
peace
and
consolation
among
the
fields
and
on
the
riverside
so
that
there
were
many
who
even
now
had
little
occupation
except
to
think
of
the
father
goodness
and
to
rest
and
they
told
her
how
the
lord
himself
would
come
among
them
and
sit
down
under
a
tree
and
tell
them
one
of
his
parables
and
make
them
all
more
happy
than
words
could
say
and
how
sometimes
he
would
send
one
out
of
the
beautiful
city
with
a
poem
or
tale
to
say
to
them
and
bands
of
lovely
music
more
lovely
than
anything
beside
except
the
sound
of
the
lord
own
voice
and
what
is
more
wonderful
the
angels
themselves
come
often
and
listen
to
us
they
said
when
we
begin
to
talk
and
remind
each
other
of
the
old
time
and
how
we
suffered
heat
and
cold
and
were
bowed
down
with
labor
and
bending
over
the
soil
and
how
sometimes
the
harvest
would
fail
us
and
sometimes
we
had
not
bread
and
sometimes
would
hush
the
children
to
sleep
because
there
was
nothing
to
give
them
and
how
we
grew
old
and
weary
and
still
worked
on
and
on
we
are
those
who
were
old
a
number
of
them
called
out
to
her
with
a
murmuring
sound
of
laughter
one
looking
over
another
shoulder
and
one
woman
said
the
angels
say
to
us
you
never
think
the
father
had
forsaken
you
and
the
lord
forgotten
you
and
all
the
rest
answered
as
in
a
chorus
there
were
moments
that
we
thought
this
but
all
the
time
we
knew
that
it
could
not
be
and
the
angels
wonder
at
us
said
another
all
this
they
said
crowding
one
before
another
every
one
anxious
to
say
something
and
sometimes
speaking
together
but
always
in
accord
and
then
there
was
a
sound
of
laughter
and
pleasure
both
at
the
strange
thought
that
the
lord
could
have
forgotten
them
and
at
the
wonder
of
the
angels
over
their
simple
tales
and
immediately
they
began
to
remind
each
other
and
say
do
you
remember
and
they
told
the
little
pilgrim
a
hundred
tales
of
the
hardships
and
troubles
they
had
known
all
smiling
and
radiant
with
pleasure
and
at
every
new
account
the
others
would
applaud
and
rejoice
feeling
the
happiness
all
the
more
for
the
evils
that
were
past
and
some
of
them
led
her
into
their
gardens
to
show
her
their
flowers
and
to
tell
her
how
they
had
begun
to
study
and
learn
how
colors
were
changed
and
form
perfected
and
the
secrets
of
the
growth
and
of
the
germ
of
which
they
had
been
ignorant
and
others
arranged
themselves
in
choirs
and
sang
to
her
delightful
songs
of
the
fields
and
accompanied
her
out
upon
her
way
singing
and
answering
to
each
other
the
difference
between
the
simple
folk
and
the
greatness
of
the
others
made
the
little
pilgrim
wonder
and
admire
and
she
loved
them
in
her
simplicity
and
turned
back
many
a
time
to
wave
her
hand
to
them
and
to
listen
to
the
lovely
simple
singing
as
it
went
further
and
further
away
it
had
an
evening
tone
of
rest
and
quietness
and
of
protection
and
peace
he
leadeth
me
by
the
green
pastures
and
beside
the
quiet
waters
she
said
to
herself
and
her
heart
swelled
with
pleasure
to
think
that
it
was
those
who
had
been
so
old
and
so
weary
and
poor
who
had
this
rest
to
console
them
for
all
their
sorrows
and
as
she
went
along
not
only
did
she
pass
through
many
other
villages
but
met
many
on
the
way
who
were
travelling
towards
the
great
city
and
would
greet
her
sweetly
as
they
passed
and
sometimes
stop
to
say
a
pleasant
word
so
that
the
little
pilgrim
was
never
lonely
wherever
she
went
but
most
of
them
began
to
speak
to
her
in
the
other
language
which
was
as
beautiful
and
sweet
as
music
but
which
she
could
not
understand
and
they
were
surprised
to
find
her
ignorant
of
it
not
knowing
that
she
was
but
a
into
these
lands
and
there
were
many
things
that
could
not
be
told
but
in
that
language
for
the
earthly
tongue
had
no
words
to
express
them
the
little
pilgrim
was
a
little
sad
not
to
understand
what
was
said
to
her
but
cheered
herself
with
the
thought
that
it
should
be
taught
to
her
by
one
whom
she
loved
best
the
way
by
the
riverside
was
very
cheerful
and
bright
with
many
people
coming
and
going
and
many
villages
some
of
them
with
a
bridge
across
the
stream
some
withdrawn
among
the
fields
but
all
of
them
bright
and
full
of
life
and
with
sounds
of
music
and
voices
and
footsteps
and
the
little
pilgrim
felt
no
weariness
and
moved
along
as
lightly
as
a
child
taking
great
pleasure
in
everything
she
saw
and
answering
all
the
friendly
greetings
with
all
her
heart
yet
glad
to
think
that
she
was
approaching
ever
nearer
to
the
country
where
it
was
ordained
that
she
should
dwell
for
a
time
and
succor
the
strangers
and
receive
those
who
were
newly
arrived
and
she
consoled
herself
with
the
thought
that
there
was
no
need
of
any
language
but
that
which
she
knew
as
this
went
through
her
mind
making
her
glad
she
suddenly
became
aware
of
one
who
was
walking
by
her
side
a
lady
who
was
covered
with
a
veil
white
and
shining
like
that
which
ama
had
worn
in
the
beautiful
city
it
hung
about
this
head
so
that
it
was
not
easy
to
see
her
face
but
the
sound
of
her
voice
was
very
sweet
in
the
pilgrim
ear
yet
startled
her
like
the
sound
of
something
which
she
knew
well
but
could
not
remember
and
as
there
were
few
who
were
going
that
way
she
was
glad
and
said
let
us
walk
together
if
that
pleases
you
and
the
stranger
said
it
is
for
that
i
have
come
which
was
a
reply
which
made
the
little
pilgrim
wonder
more
and
more
though
she
was
very
glad
and
joyful
to
have
this
companion
upon
her
way
and
then
the
lady
began
to
ask
her
many
questions
not
about
the
city
or
the
great
things
she
had
seen
but
about
herself
and
what
the
dear
lord
had
given
her
to
do
i
am
little
and
weak
and
i
can
not
do
much
the
little
pilgrim
said
it
is
nothing
but
pleasure
it
is
to
welcome
those
that
are
coming
and
tell
them
sometimes
they
are
astonished
and
do
not
know
i
was
so
myself
i
came
in
my
sleep
and
understood
nothing
but
now
that
i
know
it
is
sweet
to
tell
them
that
they
need
not
fear
i
was
glad
the
lady
said
that
you
came
in
your
sleep
for
sometimes
the
way
is
dark
and
hard
and
you
are
little
and
tender
when
your
brother
comes
you
will
be
the
first
to
see
him
and
show
him
the
way
my
brother
is
he
coming
the
little
pilgrim
cried
and
then
she
said
with
a
wistful
look
but
we
are
all
brethren
and
you
mean
only
one
of
those
who
are
the
children
of
our
father
you
must
forgive
me
that
i
do
not
know
the
higher
speech
but
only
what
is
natural
for
i
have
not
yet
been
long
here
he
whom
i
mean
is
called
and
here
the
lady
said
a
name
which
was
the
true
name
of
a
brother
born
whom
the
pilgrim
loved
above
all
others
she
gave
a
cry
and
then
she
said
trembling
i
know
your
voice
but
i
can
not
see
your
face
and
what
you
say
makes
me
think
of
many
things
no
one
else
has
covered
her
face
when
she
has
spoken
to
me
i
know
you
and
yet
i
can
not
tell
who
you
are
the
woman
stood
for
a
little
without
saying
a
word
and
then
very
softly
in
a
voice
which
only
the
heart
heard
she
called
the
little
pilgrim
by
her
name
mother
cried
the
pilgrim
with
such
a
cry
of
joy
that
it
echoed
all
about
in
the
sweet
air
and
flung
herself
upon
the
veiled
lady
and
drew
the
veil
from
her
face
and
saw
that
it
was
she
and
with
this
sight
there
came
a
revelation
which
flooded
her
soul
with
happiness
for
the
face
which
had
been
old
and
feeble
was
old
no
longer
but
fair
in
the
maturity
of
day
and
the
figure
that
had
been
bent
and
weary
was
full
of
a
tender
majesty
and
the
arms
that
clasped
her
about
were
warm
and
soft
with
love
and
life
and
all
that
had
changed
their
relations
in
the
other
days
and
made
the
mother
in
her
weakness
seem
as
a
child
and
transferred
all
protection
and
strength
to
the
daughter
was
gone
for
ever
and
the
little
pilgrim
beheld
in
a
rapture
one
who
was
her
sister
and
equal
yet
ever
above
her
more
near
to
her
than
any
though
all
were
so
near
one
of
whom
she
herself
was
a
part
yet
another
and
who
knew
all
her
thoughts
and
the
way
of
them
before
they
arose
in
her
and
to
see
her
face
as
in
the
days
of
her
prime
and
her
eyes
so
clear
and
wise
and
to
feel
once
more
that
which
is
different
from
the
love
of
all
that
which
is
still
most
sweet
where
all
is
sweet
the
love
of
one
was
like
a
crown
to
her
in
her
happiness
the
little
pilgrim
could
not
think
for
joy
nor
say
a
word
but
held
this
dear
mother
hands
and
looked
in
her
face
and
her
heart
soared
away
to
the
father
in
thanks
and
joy
they
sat
down
by
the
roadside
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
while
the
river
ran
softly
by
and
everything
was
hushed
out
of
sympathy
and
kindness
and
questioned
each
other
of
all
that
had
been
and
was
to
be
and
the
little
pilgrim
told
all
the
little
news
of
home
and
of
the
brothers
and
sisters
and
the
children
that
had
been
born
and
of
those
whose
faces
were
turned
towards
this
better
country
and
the
mother
smiled
and
listened
and
would
have
heard
all
over
and
over
although
many
things
she
already
knew
but
why
should
i
tell
you
for
did
not
you
watch
over
us
and
see
all
we
did
and
were
not
you
near
us
always
the
little
pilgrim
said
how
could
that
be
said
the
mother
for
we
are
not
like
our
lord
to
be
everywhere
we
come
and
go
where
we
are
sent
but
sometimes
we
knew
and
sometimes
saw
and
always
loved
and
whenever
our
hearts
were
sick
for
news
it
was
but
to
go
to
him
and
he
told
us
everything
and
now
my
little
one
you
are
as
we
are
and
have
seen
the
lord
and
this
has
been
given
us
to
teach
our
child
once
more
and
show
you
the
heavenly
language
that
you
may
understand
all
both
the
little
and
the
great
then
the
pilgrim
lifted
her
head
from
her
mother
bosom
and
looked
in
her
face
with
eyes
full
of
longing
you
said
she
said
the
mother
did
nothing
but
smile
then
lifted
her
eyes
and
looked
along
the
beautiful
path
of
the
river
to
where
some
one
was
coming
to
join
them
and
the
little
pilgrim
cried
out
again
in
wonder
and
joy
and
presently
found
herself
seated
between
them
her
father
and
her
mother
the
two
who
had
loved
her
most
in
the
other
days
they
looked
more
beautiful
than
the
angels
and
all
the
great
persons
whom
she
had
seen
for
still
they
were
hers
and
she
was
theirs
more
than
all
the
angels
and
all
the
blessed
could
be
and
thus
she
learned
that
though
the
new
may
take
the
place
of
the
old
and
many
things
may
blossom
out
of
it
like
flowers
yet
that
the
old
is
never
done
away
and
then
they
sat
together
telling
of
everything
that
had
befallen
and
all
the
little
tender
things
that
were
of
no
import
and
all
the
great
changes
and
noble
ways
and
the
wonders
of
heaven
above
and
the
earth
beneath
for
all
were
open
to
them
both
great
and
small
and
when
they
had
satisfied
their
souls
with
these
her
father
and
mother
began
to
teach
her
the
other
language
smiling
often
at
her
faltering
tongue
and
telling
her
the
same
thing
over
and
over
till
she
learnt
it
and
her
father
called
her
his
little
foolish
one
as
he
had
done
in
the
old
days
and
at
last
when
they
had
kissed
her
and
blessed
her
and
told
her
how
to
come
home
to
them
when
she
was
weary
they
gave
her
as
the
father
had
permitted
them
with
joy
and
blessing
her
new
name
the
little
pilgrim
was
tired
with
happiness
and
all
the
wonder
and
pleasure
and
as
she
sat
there
in
the
silence
leaning
upon
those
who
were
so
dear
to
her
the
soft
air
grew
sweeter
and
sweeter
about
her
and
the
light
faded
softly
into
a
dimness
of
tender
indulgence
and
privilege
for
her
because
she
was
still
little
and
weak
and
whether
that
heavenly
suspense
of
all
her
faculties
was
sleep
or
not
she
knew
not
but
it
was
such
as
in
all
her
life
she
had
never
known
when
she
came
back
to
herself
it
was
by
the
sound
of
many
voices
calling
her
and
many
people
hastening
past
and
beckoning
to
her
to
join
them
come
come
they
said
little
sister
there
has
been
great
trouble
in
the
other
life
and
many
have
arrived
suddenly
and
are
afraid
come
come
and
help
them
come
and
help
them
and
she
sprang
up
from
her
soft
seat
and
found
that
she
was
no
longer
by
the
riverside
or
within
sight
of
the
great
city
or
in
the
arms
of
those
she
loved
but
stood
on
one
of
the
flowery
paths
of
her
own
and
saw
her
fellows
hastening
towards
the
gates
where
there
seemed
a
great
crowd
and
she
was
no
longer
weary
but
full
of
life
and
strength
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
take
them
up
in
her
arms
those
trembling
strangers
and
carry
them
straight
to
the
father
so
strong
was
she
and
light
and
full
of
force
and
above
all
the
gladness
she
had
felt
and
all
her
pleasure
in
what
she
had
seen
and
more
happy
even
than
the
meeting
with
those
she
loved
most
was
her
happiness
how
as
she
went
along
as
light
as
the
breeze
to
receive
the
strangers
she
was
so
eager
that
she
began
to
sing
a
song
of
welcome
as
she
hastened
on
oh
welcome
welcome
she
cried
and
as
she
sang
she
knew
it
was
one
of
the
heavenly
melodies
which
she
had
heard
in
the
great
city
and
she
hastened
on
her
feet
flying
over
the
flowery
ways
thinking
how
the
great
worlds
were
all
watching
and
the
angels
looking
on
and
the
whole
universe
waiting
till
it
should
be
proved
to
them
that
the
dear
lord
the
brother
of
us
all
had
chosen
the
perfect
way
and
that
over
all
evil
and
the
sorrow
he
was
the
conqueror
alone
and
the
little
pilgrim
voice
though
it
was
so
small
echoed
away
through
the
great
firmament
to
where
the
other
worlds
were
watching
to
see
what
should
come
and
cheered
the
anxious
faces
of
some
great
lords
and
princes
far
more
great
than
she
who
were
of
a
nobler
race
than
man
for
it
was
said
among
the
stars
that
when
such
a
little
sound
could
reach
so
far
it
was
a
token
that
the
lord
had
chosen
aright
and
that
his
method
must
be
the
best
and
it
breathed
over
the
earth
like
some
one
saying
courage
to
those
whose
hearts
were
failing
and
it
dropped
down
down
into
the
great
confusions
and
traffic
of
the
land
of
darkness
and
startled
many
like
the
cry
of
a
child
calling
and
calling
and
never
ceasing
come
and
come
and
come
