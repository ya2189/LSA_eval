that
do

slow
joe
burke
was
singing
driving
south
his
rig
was
a
blue
ford
pickup
with
a
battered
cap
on
the
back
batman
all
six
inches
of
him
was
propped
upright
on
the
dash
joe
followed
signs
to
the
weston
priory
climbing
through
woods
and
out
onto
an
open
plateau
a
cluster
of
wooden
buildings
stood
near
a
pond
a
monk
was
raking
leaves
from
a
path
that
curved
around
the
pond
like
a
trotter
track
joe
got
out
stretched
and
entered
a
gift
shop
by
the
parking
lot
a
middle
aged
woman
seated
next
to
the
cash
register
closed
her
book
where
is
everybody
rehearsing
she
smiled
slightly
and
remained
silent
lovely
day
joe
said
yes
is
it
he
bought
a
cassette
made
by
the
monks
a
bit
stagy
batman
he
said
climbing
into
the
truck
and
closing
the
door
we
must
continue
to
seek
truth
and
contend
with
the
forces
of
evil
batman
stared
resolutely
ahead
joe
cut
over
to
the
interstate
when
he
reached
the
highway
he
played
the
cassette
resonant
voices
and
a
single
guitar
encouraging
sappy
ingrid
had
declared
impatiently
joe
smiled
she
was
free
of
his
taste
in
music
now
had
been
for
a
year
and
a
half
at
brattleboro
he
turned
off
the
highway
rented
a
motel
room
and
walked
into
town
he
found
a
brew
pub
where
he
sat
at
a
corner
table
with
a
pint
of
ruby
brown
ale
cool
and
fresh
the
malt
veiled
with
lacy
astringent
hops
he
had
another
and
watched
the
bartender
talk
on
the
telephone
her
elbows
and
breasts
on
the
bar
a
vertical
worry
line
dropping
between
her
eyes
she
was
about
his
daughter
kate
age
the
room
began
to
fill
the
nasal
sound
of
new
york
mixing
with
flat
new
england
tones
the
connecticut
river
valley
narrows
in
brattleboro
a
gateway
to
upper
new
england
for
new
yorkers
he
was
going
through
in
the
other
direction
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do
next
what
do
you
do
at
when
the
kids
are
grown
the
same
things
all
over
again
he
took
out
a
notebook
and
remembered
the
drive
the
blue
sky
the
red
and
gold
ridges
small
fields
tilting
greenly
in
their
arms
on
such
a
day
one
could
almost
be
forgiven
he
wrote
a
blonde
woman
with
a
wry
smile
an
experienced
charmer
sat
down
at
the
next
table
he
considered
having
another
ale
making
friends
with
her
and
starting
a
new
life
in
brattleboro
or
over
the
mountain
in
bennington
but
he
knew
that
he
was
fooling
himself
it
was
too
familiar
he
might
as
well
have
stayed
in
maine
got
ta
go
he
said
to
her
sadly
she
raised
her
eyebrows
acknowledging
the
human
condition
and
he
walked
back
to
the
motel
at
the
edge
of
town
trees
were
dark
behind
a
body
of
water
that
was
platinum
and
still
fish
broke
the
surface
with
soft
slaps
in
the
centers
of
expanding
circles
ansel
adams
might
have
caught
the
many
shades
of
silver
just
before
the
lights
went
out
the
next
afternoon
joe
was
across
the
hudson
driving
through
the
mountains
on
roads
that
were
more
crowded
than
he
remembered
there
were
many
new
houses
and
the
trees
were
larger
he
stopped
on
the
hill
by
his
grandparents
old
house
in
woodstock
captain
ben
had
retired
during
the
depression
to
that
rocky
hillside
and
made
a
homely
paradise
of
gardens
and
fruit
trees
a
slow
silent
job
emily
was
beside
him
canning
cooking
and
mothering
they
said
you
could
grow
pears
around
there
we
ate
a
lot
of
pears
joe
thought
and
plums
apples
rhubarb
strawberries
asparagus
the
house
smelled
of
geraniums
from
the
solar
greenhouse
that
his
grandfather
built
onto
the
dining
room
long
before
anyone
ever
heard
of
a
solar
greenhouse
captain
ben
was
a
son
of
an
old
virginia
family
who
in
better
days
had
owned
monticello
lined
a
living
room
shelf
noblesse
oblige
came
with
mother
milk
you
are
born
privileged
you
have
an
obligation
he
had
a
company
garden
when
he
was
serving
in
the
philippines
men
who
got
out
of
line
did
time
weeding
and
afterwards
ate
fresh
vegetables
once
a
year
he
would
go
to
town
and
whip
the
touring
chess
master
who
was
playing
people
at
once
pawn
to
four
he
taught
joe
control
the
center
joe
opened
with
pawn
to
queen
knight
four
bringing
a
smile
learn
the
hard
way
huh
he
died
when
joe
was
in
seventh
grade
and
joe
spent
his
high
school
years
with
his
grandmother
well
cared
for
but
living
more
or
less
alone
she
remarried
about
the
time
joe
graduated
the
new
husband
moved
to
the
attic
and
joe
moved
out
the
house
that
joe
remembered
had
disappeared
inside
a
gaudy
renovation
but
the
mountains
had
changed
what
is
it
about
land
joe
wondered
it
gets
inside
you
deep
as
your
loves
maybe
deeper
he
ate
dinner
in
town
he
saw
aaron
shultis
across
the
street
but
aaron
did
recognize
him
after
years
joe
drove
back
into
the
hills
and
parked
by
a
narrow
lane
across
from
the
one
room
schoolhouse
where
he
had
gone
to
fifth
grade
he
fell
asleep
in
a
cradle
of
memories
fucking
sally
in
this
very
spot
apple
fights
bb
gun
fights
the
sound
of
the
schoolhouse
bell
calling
them
out
of
the
woods
after
a
long
recess
a
steady
rain
was
bringing
down
the
leaves
when
joe
woke
up
he
drove
over
to
morgan
house
and
pounded
on
the
door
when
morgan
opened
joe
could
smell
breakfast

brings
you
out
in
the
rain

of
these
days
i

morgan
said

my
father
just
laughed
i
think
he
was
trying
to
tell
me

but
did
know
how
hard
to
communicate
at
this
point
i
suppose
morgan
said

he
riding
on
the
dash
joe
gave
morgan

the
damnedest
thing
i
bought
a
tape
of
chesapeake
bay
sea
chanteys
a
while
back
one
of
the
voices
was
familiar
i
looked
on
the
picture
of
the
group
and
there
was
jason
i
had
even
noticed
best
banjo
player
i
ever

joe

why
do
you
take
it
i
pick
up
another
good
deal

france

fine
morgan
took
a
piece
of
bacon
she
and
wes
have
stuck

with

and
i
feel
warm
and
safe
when
i
with
wes
joe
shook
his
head
knowing
what
i
do
now
about

is
i
say
she
made
the
mainstream
choice
she
have
had
rice
and
beans
with
me
red
beans
and
rice
are
bad
morgan
said
true
we
could
have
gone
the
distance
though
strange
how
you
know
these
things
not
that
i
have
had
good
relationships
since
i
mean
sally
and
i
had
kate
and
then
i
had
the
chance
to
be
part
of
maxie
life
i
would
trade
that
for
anything
but
so
your
love
life
morgan
eyebrows
raised
prospects
are
bright
he
said
prospects
plural
singular
he
said
yok
excellent
and
the
book
how
that
coming
along
slowly
my
publisher
annoyed
but
he
used
to
delays
and
houses
of
the
hudson
are
going
anywhere
i
wish
that
were
true
morgan
said
they
going
downhill
on
the
other
hand
if
they
were
i
would
have
any
work
rot
joe
said
your
enemy
neglect
morgan
said
they
finished
breakfast
and
hauled
joe
footlocker
to
the
barn
going
to
have
a
book
shop
when
i
retire
morgan
said
the
fortress
and
the
cork
joe
said
putting
down
one
end
of
the
footlocker
in
a
room
filled
with
books
two
good
strategies
strong
walls
or
travel
light
bob
up
and
down
in
the
heavy
weather
you
always
did
travel
light
morgan
said
but
you
probably
do
bob
as
well
as
you
did
joe
hopped
on
both
feet
to
demonstrate
his
buoyancy
thanks
for
the
reminder
departures
required
gallantry
good
eggs
listen
if
you
get
a
chance
give
daisy
my
love
tell
her
nothing
changed
morgan
nodded
and
they
walked
out
to
the
truck
take
care
of
yourself
joe
said
hang
in
there
good
luck
morgan
said
joe
drove
down
the
mountain
in
the
rain
when
he
reached
route
he
turned
towards
phoenicia
his
old
high
school
district
covered
a
thousand
square
miles
half
an
hour
later
as
he
crossed
its
western
boundary
he
felt
a
twinge
of
nostalgia
and
relief
it
was
like
graduating
again
his
mind
was
free
to
drift
forward
at
tech
school
in
the
air
force
he
used
to
spend
friday
and
saturday
nights
in
the
bx
with
a
guy
named
shannon
the
bx
was
always
jammed
with
drinking
cheap
beer
and
eating
french
fries
one
man
tried
to
keep
up
with
the
empties
and
the
dirty
dishes
he
was
bald
slow
moving
friendly
and
particular
his
cart
was
organized
to
hold
as
much
as
possible
on
each
trip
it
seemed
like
the
original
dead
end
job
but
he
did
it
well
never
flustered
taking
pride
in
his
cart
and
the
tables
that
were
clean
for
moments
he
told
joe
once
that
he
was
saving
money
to
buy
tools
so
that
he
could
help
in
his
friend
garage
as
joe
drove
the
rain
and
fog
lifted
revealing
lonely
bays
and
wooded
hillsides
route
curved
endlessly
along
the
banks
of
the
pepacton
reservoir
joe
had
the
highest
entrance
score
they
ever
recorded
in
that
air
force
tech
school
sergeant
quimby
told
him
reading
it
unbelieving
joe
was
an
athlete
a
most
likely
to
succeed
guy
yet
there
he
was
every
weekend
in
the
bx
with
shannon
fascinated
by
the
aging
bus
boy
loading
his
cart
and
shannon
he
was
from
ten
mile
creek
south
of
pittsburgh
what
had
happened
to
him
joe
decided
to
cut
through
cat
hollow
and
over
to
roscoe
on
route
he
followed
west
taking
his
time
enjoying
the
october
colors
he
had
lunch
in
hancock
and
stayed
overnight
in
a
motel
outside
painted
post
the
next
afternoon
he
was
in
ten
mile
creek
coal
country
a
black
hill
in
the
distance
the
highest
point
around
turned
out
to
be
a
slag
pile
containers
suspended
from
cable
were
hauled
up
the
pile
tipped
over
and
returned
upside
down
the
top
of
a
silo
last
sign
of
a
buried
barn
waited
a
few
feet
above
a
spreading
shoulder
of
slag
the
air
was
gritty
and
had
a
sulfurous
tang
he
stopped
outside
an
american
legion
hall
and
walked
into
a
dimly
lit
bar
in
one
corner
a
fat
man
sat
upright
before
a
video
poker
machine
only
his
right
hand
moved
as
he
inserted
quarters
one
after
another
joe
sat
at
the
bar
three
stools
down
from
a
short
guy
who
was
staring
over
the
top
of
a
half
empty
glass
of
beer
the
bartender
moved
a
step
in
his
direction
and
waited
i
have
a
beer
joe
said
putting
a
five
dollar
bill
in
front
of
him
the
bartender
was
about
forty
he
had
a
blonde
crew
cut
and
a
face
like
a
poker
chip
robert
redford
run
into
a
door
he
set
the
beer
down
made
change
and
resumed
his
position
it
was
oddly
as
though
he
had
moved
at
all
i
was
in
the
service
with
a
guy
named
shannon
long
time
ago
said
he

head

the
navy
bobby

a

around

at
the
bartender
they
had
a
committee

the
bartender
said

he
out
there
cashing

joe
said

more
floyd
the
gambler
said
putting
a
twenty
on
the
bar
the
bartender
laid
two
quarter
rolls
soundlessly
next
to
the
bill
and
asked
you
come
around
just
to
look
up
bobby
shannon
i
ah

after
joe
meant
after

well

least
compared
to
these
guys
the
bartender
said
beware
of
gnawing
the
ideogram
of
nothingness
your
teeth
will
crack
swallow
it
whole
and
you
a
treasure
beyond
the
hope
of
buddha
and
the
mind
the
east
breeze
fondles
the
horses
ears
how
sweet

of

instant

the

joe
watched
the
toddler
with
an
ice
cream
cone
in
honolulu
the
girl
veering
her
bike
into
a
maine
hedge
the
leaving
home
the
seattle
executive
as
she
took
a
large
bite
mmmm

said
with
her
mouth
full
mmm
ivar

lately
she
asked
not

a
couple
of
months
he
still
in
new
zealand
i
had
a
card
from
auckland
in
august
kate
said
sounded
like
he
was
having
a
good
trip
how
your
mom
doing
fine
she
got
a
new
job
working
for
a
mineral
exploration
outfit
have
you
seen
ingrid
not
recently
joe
said
she
doing
well
at
least
she
was
the
last
time
i
saw
her
she
been
selling
her
jewelry
and
her
classes
keep
her
busy
same
as
ever
she
has
a
new
boyfriend
oh
good
i
love
ingrid
she
always
sends
a
christmas
card
and
tells
me
how
maxie
doing
kate
had
known
max
since
he
was
eight
they
had
become
brother
and
sister
even
though
there
was
no
blood
relationship
they
had
been
especially
close
when
kate
lived
with
ingrid
max
and
him
during
her
high
school
years
kate
had
been
lucky
joe
thought
to
have
had
two
mothers
or
a
mother
and
a
half
his
own
mother
had
died
when
he
was
seven
it
was
long
ago
but
he
could
remember
well
enough
that
he
never
liked
her
very
much
after
lunch
joe
watched
kate
walk
with
long
strides
toward
her
office
hair
bouncing
on
her
shoulders
strong
he
thought
proudly
he
checked
in
at
the
edgewater
lay
down
on
the
bed
and
did
wake
up
until
four
the
days
were
getting
shorter
a
salty
breeze
drove
layers
of
cloud
across
the
sound
as
joe
walked
down
alaskan
way
to
the
elliot
bay
book
company
the
ocean
was
to
his
right
but
he
was
headed
south
instead
of
north
as
he
would
have
been
on
the
east
coast
it
took
days
in
seattle
to
stop
thinking
that
he
was
going
the
wrong
way
the
bookstore
was
well
lit
and
cheerful
a
tall
woman
with
dark
hair
and
hammered
silver
earrings
was
browsing
in
a
corner
she
wore
a
caramel
colored
that
showed
a
black
elongated
figure
above
the
name
caffe
ladro
her
shoulders
were
wide
the
cotton
draped
comfortably
around
high
flat
breasts
and
fell
a
distance
to
her
hips
she
appeared
to
be
in
her
forties
joe
hoped
that
she
did
have
blue
eyes
two
types
of
women
got
to
joe
immediately
one
was
black
irish
blue
eyed
he
looked
into
those
eyes
something
slipped
and
he
was
calling
for
fire
night
and
vikings
to
ax
the
other
was
blonde
with
translucent
skin
full
breasted
and
silent
the
blondes
were
anima
projections
when
he
was
he
had
a
disastrous
affair
and
afterwards
discovered
the
explanation
in
a
book
by
jung
a
man
loses
touch
with
his
female
side
and
then
sees
an
unlucky
woman
who
resembles
the
inner
image
of
his
lost
self
pow
he
is
on
her
has
to
have
her
irrational
trembling
dry
throat
pounding
heart
out
of
an
anima
projection
women
do
it
too
of
course
the
other
way
around
yes
the
woman
asked
she
had
brown
eyes
oh
god
joe
said
excuse
me
i
was
thinking
about
anima
projection
psychology
in
there
she
pointed
to
another
room
this
is
cooking
ah
yes
well
joe
turned
away
the
floor
was
slick
with
banana
peels
he
made
it
around
the
corner
and
took
a
breath
too
old
for
this
he
said
to
himself
he
drifted
through
several
rooms
and
found
in
one
by
hazlitt
a
book
he
heard
about
for
years
he
was
interested
in
the
economy
because
his
small
savings
were
mostly
in
the
stock
market
he
picked
up
a
copy
of
vic
methods
of
a
wall
street
by
victor
sperandeo
by
the
time
he
chose
a
tape
of
slack
key
guitar
by
cyril
pahinui
gabby
son
it
was
dark
on
his
way
out
he
averted
his
eyes
from
the
cooking
section
but
he
need
have
the
woman
was
gone
the
edgewater
hotel
bar
has
floor
to
ceiling
windows
on
the
water
joe
ate
a
sandwich
and
watched
huge
ferries
slide
through
the
night
brilliant
against
the
black
water
they
made
the
portland
maine
ferries
look
like
life
boats
joe
went
to
bed
early
slept
fitfully
and
spent
the
next
day
walking
reading
and
exercising
his
back
was
what
it
was
too
many
years
in
front
of
a
computer
monitor
if
he
kept
at
the
yoga
exercises
it
did
bother
him
but
a
real
work
would
be
the
end
for
a
long
time
he
could
do
whatever
the
kids
could
and
then
he
could
it
made
a
divide
between
them
and
even
sometimes
between
the
past
and
present
memory
was
suspect
did
he
really
do
that
you
did
dad
you
really
did
fortunately
kate
was
there
confirming
the
past
regaling
jackson
with
stories
from
the
old
days
they
were
eating
seafood
linguini
in
her
apartment
jackson
listened
as
he
twirled
pasta
with
his
fork
and
spoon
he
was
tall
and
thin
pleasant
his
hair
was
dark
pulled
back
into
a
short
pony
tail
he
drank
a
lot
of
wine
without
seeming
to
be
much
affected
his
eyes
got
brighter
they
considered
kate
new
painting
which
was
propped
up
on
a
side
table
a
young
woman
stood
in
a
barn
door
looking
out
at
a
rainy
morning
and
an
apple
tree
in
full
white
bloom
her
hair
was
long
and
brown
her
bare
feet
interacted
with
paint
splattered
floor
boards
she
seemed
to
dance
without
moving
lot
going
on
jackson
said
lot
of
life
in
there
for
an
old
guy
joe
said
what
do
you
think
for
a
frame
jackson
considered
simple
but
with
relief
to
give
it
a
little
more
depth
be
more
inside
the
barn
definitely
simple
kate
said
i
see
what
you
mean
joe
said
that
will
be
my
part
kate
getting
it
framed
i
could
do
that
jackson
said
hey
great
let
me
know
what
it
costs
jackson
lifted
a
hand
no
problem
i
got
a
friend
with
a
frame
shop
that
quite
a
chess
set
joe
said
pointing
to
a
low
table
by
a
bookcase
the
pieces
were
hand
carved
and
had
a
warm
waxed
shine
they
were
slightly
larger
than
usual
and
looked
as
though
they
were
meant
to
be
handled
jackson
made
those
last
winter
kate
said
he
just
makes
this
stuff
like
knitting
or
something
jackson
looked
embarrassed
dad
how
long
are
you
going
to
be
in
seattle
the
question
had
been
floating
in
the
back
of
joe
mind
the
answer
crystallized
not
long
they
waited
for
him
to
continue
i
know
what
i
going
to
do
really
but
i
feeling
jumpy
i
let
you
know
you
got
my
address
i
check
in
every
so
often
he
wanted
to
keep
his
uncertainty
away
from
kate
it
was
so
much
that
he
wanted
to
shield
her
but
more
that
he
needed
to
confront
the
future
unhindered
by
old
patterns
of
relating
and
response
stick
around
kate
said
the
longer
the
better
jackson
smiled
neutrally
a
good
time
to
leave
joe
thought
very
nice
to
meet
you
jackson
he
said
he
hugged
kate
and
left
feeling
that
they
were
a
good
match
on
the
way
off
the
hill
he
noticed
the
caffe
ladro
and
remembered
the
woman
in
the
bookstore
the
next
morning
he
thought
about
checking
out
of
the
edgewater
but
he
had
no
plan
he
registered
for
another
night
and
drove
back
to
the
queen
anne
district
he
had
a
latte
and
a
bagel
in
the
caffe
ladro
and
bought
a
he
was
hoping
the
woman
would
come
in
her
name
would
be
moira
they
would
have
an
animated
discussion
which
would
reveal
his
fate
she
did
show
must
have
been
busy
probably
making
a
lemon
meringue
pie
he
went
back
to
the
hotel
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
in
his
room
filson
was
in
seattle
he
remembered
he
looked
for
the
address
in
the
phone
book
and
found
that
it
was
a
short
bus
ride
away
he
had
a
wool
filson
jacket
that
he
worn
for
years
every
so
often
he
sewed
a
button
tighter
filson
stuff
is
understated
and
invincible
it
would
be
like
a
visit
to
the
temple
a
temple
angel
slim
with
long
blonde
hair
asked
if
she
could
help
not
just
yet
joe
said
and
wandered
down
aisles
of
tin
cloth
pants
wax
impregnated
jackets
with
wool
liners
vests
and
virgin
wool
sweaters
he
stood
a
long
time
in
front
of
the
duffel
bags
and
assorted
luggage
he
was
tempted
by
a
carry
on
bag
with
a
heavy
leather
handle
but
in
the
end
he
bought
a
bag
that
reminded
him
of
his
air
force
awol
bag
flat
bottomed
with
a
humped
top
and
a
single
massive
brass
zipper
the
canvas
twill
was
doubled
around
the
sides
and
bottom
the
handles
and
the
shoulder
strap
were
made
of
dark
bridle
leather
it
was
the
fort
knox
of
awol
bags
while
he
was
at
it
he
bought
a
belt
made
of
the
same
heavy
leather
might
as
well
have
the
best
he
said
to
the
angel
repeating
the
filson
motto
when
he
was
back
in
his
room
he
unsnapped
the
new
belt
buckle
and
replaced
it
with
the
one
he
had
worn
for
twenty
years
the
words
he
had
scratched
on
it
with
a
dremel
power
tool
were
nearly
rubbed
away
eating
a
plum
the
roar
of
centuries
kokee
once
a
year
the
islanders
are
allowed
to
pick
plums
in
kokee
in
a
park
on
the
rim
of
a
deep
canyon
the
trees
are
old
with
thick
limbs
he
remembered
a
young
hawaiian
woman
on
a
low
limb
stretched
out
reaching
for
plums
brown
skin
black
hair
dark
green
leaves
fruit
the
ocean
gray
and
blue
for
thousands
of
miles
in
all
directions
echoing
silence
it
was
like
being
in
a
shell
or
a
giant
ear
joe
put
on
his
new
belt
and
went
down
to
the
hotel
bar
he
ordered
an
ale
and
watched
a
boxing
match
on
a
large
tv
pit
bull
salvatori
was
wearing
down
a
fighter
named
fanatuua
he
was
sagging
his
body
blotchy
the
bell
rang
and
fanatuua
collapsed
back
against
a
padded
corner
post
a
trainer
squirted
something
into
his
mouth
and
rubbed
his
chest
while
his
manager
talked
in
his
ear
fanatuua
nodded
once
the
bell
rang
again
and
pit
bull
was
on
him
lefts
rights
uppercuts
trying
to
end
it
at
some
point
in
life
joe
thought
how
people
lose
becomes
more
interesting
than
how
they
win
fanatuua
would
go
down
seemed
calm
almost
as
though
he
were
there
he
was
covering
up
weaving
slowly
from
side
to
side
maybe
he
was
fighting
the
clock
not
the
man
maybe
if
he
made
it
through
eight
rounds
he
would
have
earned
his
money
maybe
he
was
out
on
his
feet
the
philly
crowd
yelled
for
a
knockout
the
referee
watched
closely
fanatuua
stepped
forward
moved
pit
bull
back
threw
a
combination
that
did
no
damage
maybe
he
was
fighting
for
his
family
joe
thought
maybe
he
was
married
to
one
of
the
samoan
women
who
come
to
hawaii
to
work
in
the
polynesian
cultural
center
and
study
at
the
mormon
school
in
laie
they
walk
slowly
across
the
grass
books
in
their
arms
flowers
in
their
dark
hair
he
ought
to
make
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
from
this
fight
maybe
he
give
it
to
his
father
the
chief
who
was
proud
of
him
who
would
know
what
to
do
with
it
his
hands
dropped
pit
bull
drove
him
into
the
ropes
with
an
overhand
right
the
camera
zoomed
to
fanatuua
face
sweat
a
small
cut
his
eyes
were
bright
his
mouth
was
set
in
a
slight
smile
he
was
not
afraid
pit
bull
smashed
him
four
times
the
ref
jumped
in
and
separated
them
tko
pit
bull
ran
around
the
ring
fists
in
the
air
and
hugged
fanatuua
fanatuua
tapped
him
twice
on
the
back
and
walked
to
his
corner
maybe
he
was
thinking
that
salvatori
won
might
be
the
champ
soon
but
could
knock
him
out
maybe
he
was
thinking
about
home
joe
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
remembered
his
new
bag
he
pictured
himself
packing
it
and
realized
that
he
was
going
to
hawaii
that
was
why
he
bought
the
bag
although
he
had
known
it
at
the
time
there
were
complications
the
truck
what
to
bring
what
to
do
when
he
got
there
but
that
was
where
he
was
going
as
the
plane
banked
over
diamond
head
green
at
that
time
of
year
tears
came
to
joe
eyes
hawaii
is
so
beautiful
so
far
out
to
sea
that
he
felt
lucky
just
to
be
there
when
he
stepped
from
the
plane
the
light
perfume
of
plumeria
and
the
warm
breeze
were
like
old
friends
he
had
credit
cards
and
a
few
bucks
in
the
market
but
he
might
have
been
thirty
again
driving
a
cab
hoping
for
a
load
to
the
kahala
and
a
big
tip
he
rode
the
city
bus
into
waikiki
the
filson
bag
on
his
lap
and
rented
a
room
for
a
week
on
kuhio
avenue
a
concrete
block
room
with
a
four
foot
lanai
a
tiny
refrigerator
and
a
hot
plate
an
hour
later
he
was
beneath
the
banyan
tree
at
the
moana
beach
bar
gilbert
was
still
tending
bar
gilbert
you
have
changed
a
bit
gilbert
was
from
honolulu
medium
sized
with
dark
hair
and
dark
eyes
he
could
have
been
from
anywhere
his
square
features
were
professionally
neutral
his
smile
was
quick
and
ironic
under
control
your
eyes
going
gilbert
said
joe
ordered
a
mai
tai
for
old
time
sake
sunset
is
a
three
hour
show
in
waikiki
joe
stayed
until
the
end
the
last
high
smudge
of
crimson
snuffed
out
in
darkness
the
pacific
reduced
to
the
sound
of
waves
collapsing
along
the
beach
on
his
way
back
to
the
hotel
a
woman
in
a
mini
skirt
asked
if
he
wanted
a
date
not
tonight
but
if
i
did
i
be
here
tomorrow
she
had
large
teeth
a
big
smile
he
want
a
date
let
alone
that
kind
of
date
but
he
felt
a
rush
of
warmth
it
hard
not
to
like
someone
who
is
willing
to
hold
you
even
if
only
for
money
the
warmth
followed
him
into
bed
and
softened
the
sounds
of
car
horns
and
distant
sirens
in
the
morning
he
had
a
solid
hangover
he
trudged
out
of
waikiki
to
the
shopping
center
and
ate
breakfast
in
a
coffee
shop
that
served
the
best
portuguese
sausage
on
the
island
made
he
was
told
by
an
elderly
couple
whose
identity
was
secret
he
bought
a
bus
pass
valid
for
the
rest
of
november
the
honolulu
bus
system
reaches
around
the
island
across
the
island
up
the
ridges
and
deep
into
the
separate
valley
neighborhoods
workers
and
students
commute
by
bus
kids
give
up
their
seats
to
the
elderly
joe
quartered
around
the
city
like
a
hunting
dog
years
earlier
the
state
bird
was
said
to
be
the
crane
now
it
was
an
endangered
species
the
city
was
quieter
he
found
himself
returning
to
makiki
a
neighborhood
of
low
rise
apartment
buildings
and
condominiums
on
a
steep
hillside
half
an
hour
walk
in
different
directions
to
the
university
and
to
the
ala
moana
shopping
center
it
was
beautiful
there
at
night
the
buildings
lit
above
and
below
each
other
like
modern
cliff
dwellings
a
week
after
he
arrived
he
rented
a
one
bedroom
apartment
on
liholiho
street
telling
the
realtor
that
he
had
a
degree
from
the
university
which
was
true
and
that
he
was
retired
which
did
sound
right
he
amended
it
was
a
bare
bones
apartment
on
the
third
floor
with
a
lanai
that
faced
mauka
toward
the
mountain
joe
bought
a
plastic
chair
a
round
cafe
table
and
an
hibachi
for
the
lanai
batman
made
himself
comfortable
on
the
table
joe
constructed
a
table
in
the
room
from
pine
boards
and
milk
crates
he
bought
a
foam
camping
mattress
sheets
a
light
comforter
a
pillow
and
a
reading
lamp
for
the
bedroom
for
the
kitchen
he
bought
a
toaster
a
tea
kettle
a
pot
for
cooking
rice
and
a
wok
he
set
up
a
minimalist
home
one
plate
a
bowl
and
a
mug
chopsticks
he
splurged
on
an
eight
inch
chef
knife
after
a
week
of
moving
the
plastic
chair
in
and
out
he
bought
a
straight
backed
wooden
chair
for
inside
he
bought
an
exercise
mat
which
he
left
spread
out
in
the
main
room
it
was
fun
to
start
over
in
this
way
owning
only
what
he
needed
for
his
new
life
whatever
that
was
going
to
be
after
some
consideration
he
bought
a
compact
sound
system
and
a
tv
for
news
and
sports
he
ate
rice
and
fish
bought
vegetables
at
the
farmers
market
and
walked
on
the
beach
the
beach
belongs
to
the
people
in
hawaii
it
can
not
be
owned
or
sealed
off
he
bought
a
few
aloha
shirts
and
spent
days
at
the
university
the
main
library
downtown
the
shopping
center
and
occasionally
waikiki
in
a
month
he
had
a
tan
and
his
pidgin
had
come
back
kate
had
learned
to
talk
on
the
island
she
spoke
pidgin
from
deep
down
joe
pidgin
was
only
half
way
there
if
the
locals
are
in
doubt
they
will
ask
anything
in
order
to
hear
you
speak
in
a
few
words
they
know
how
long
you
been
around
joe
did
mind
the
test
usually
he
got
points
for
trying
kate
wanted
him
to
visit
during
the
holidays
but
he
decided
against
it
he
was
just
getting
used
to
the
island
and
he
did
feel
like
traveling
the
day
after
christmas
he
was
at
the
moana
leaning
back
with
a
beer
and
thinking
about
sperandeo
book
on
stock
trading
when
someone
asked
caffe
ladro
the
woman
he
seen
in
seattle
was
standing
a
few
feet
away
looking
at
his
ah
moira
he
said
standing
up
she
was
trying
to
place
him
winifred
she
said
i
saw
you
in
the
elliot
bay
book
company
he
said
last
month
moira
was
a
guess
oh
yes
something
funny
you
had
a
projection
very
funny
joe
said
winifred
my
name
is
joe
joe
burke
why
not
come
sit
talk
story
i
given
up
on
men
she
said
to
someone
listening
in
the
banyan
very
sensible
joe
said
she
hesitated
and
sat
i
love
this
tree
she
said
placing
her
sun
glasses
on
the
table
between
them
did
someone
write
about
it
or
under
it
he
offered
stevenson
she
said
or
was
it
mark
twain
her
eyes
were
intensely
brown
with
radiating
streaks
of
garnet
it
a
literary
banyan
joe
said
so
what
brings
you
to
hawaii
i
used
to
live
here
joe
said
i
stopped
computer
programming
and
i
stopped
being
married
again
it
seemed
natural
to
come
back
hawaii
gets
to
you
she
said
winifred
lived
in
manoa
she
was
a
photographer
joe
would
have
bet
that
she
was
some
kind
of
artist
he
found
them
wherever
he
went
her
sister
lived
on
queen
anne
hill
in
seattle
close
to
kate
and
the
caffe
ladro
her
father
arthur
soule
was
a
professor
retired
in
vermont
lot
of
soules
on
the
maine
coast
joe
said
and
a
coffin
clan
the
line
is
every
soule
there
a
coffin
so
my
father
has
told
me
win
winifred
what
do
you
prefer
to
be
called
either
works
is
what
horses
do
my
father
sometimes
calls
me
freddy
how
about
mo
no
one
calls
me
mo
excellent
i
shall
be
the
first
she
had
large
features
a
wide
serious
mouth
that
turned
slightly
up
or
down
at
the
corners
down
in
this
case
i
thought
of
you
as
moira
joe
explained
mysterious
celt
born
for
the
luck
of
the
burkes
born
to
be
bad
she
said
you
can
think
of
me
any
way
you
like
joe
burke
i
must
be
going
bye
she
twirled
her
sun
glasses
smiled
once
and
left
he
watched
to
see
if
she
would
swing
her
ass
a
little
for
his
benefit
but
she
did
her
eyes
stayed
with
him
large
and
sensitive
clear
she
was
nearly
six
feet
tall
and
broad
across
the
shoulders
her
hands
were
as
big
as
his
not
the
happiest
of
campers
he
said
to
himself
he
went
back
to
thinking
about
victor
sperandeo
book
as
a
trader
vic
made
a
living
playing
cards
in
new
york
then
he
moved
into
the
big
casino
on
wall
street
his
book
was
straight
exposition
written
without
pretense
joe
had
read
other
books
about
the
market
there
were
many
different
approaches
and
specialties
day
trading
intermediate
and
long
term
investing
stocks
bonds
currencies
and
commodities
sperandeo
was
someone
he
could
relate
to
personally
a
maverick
there
were
other
market
gurus
who
made
sense
to
him
john
train
and
warren
buffett
especially
they
espoused
a
strategy
think
before
you
buy
and
then
once
having
bought
continue
to
buy
on
dips
and
hold
unless
the
company
changed
fundamentally
for
the
worse
sperandeo
was
more
of
a
trader
joe
was
torn
between
the
two
approaches
discount
brokerages
had
just
become
available
on
the
internet
one
could
trade
without
having
to
actually
live
in
new
york
on
line
discussion
groups
argued
about
stocks
hours
a
day
he
decided
to
buy
a
computer
three
hours
later
joe
paid
the
cab
fare
and
carried
his
new
system
up
to
the
apartment
one
box
at
a
time
he
had
it
working
in
an
hour
and
went
to
bed
pleased
with
himself
the
following
day
he
opened
an
account
with
a
service
provider
for
internet
access
there
was
an
message
from
kate
waiting
at
his
old
address
in
maine
joe
had
agreed
to
pay
kate
mechanic
a
month
to
store
the
truck
and
had
asked
him
to
go
over
it
change
the
oil
and
do
whatever
needed
doing
joe
replied
that
the
check
would
be
in
the
mail
and
wished
her
a
happy
new
year
the
internet
is
amazing
he
thought
the
message
was
in
maine
kate
was
in
seattle
he
was
in
honolulu
and
could
be
anywhere
damn
batman
we
global
on
impulse
he
found
a
number
listed
for
soule
and
called
her
on
the
old
fashioned
telephone
after
a
recorded
message
and
a
beep
he
said
mo
this
is
joe
burke
i
having
adventures
want
to
have
lunch
he
left
his
number
and
hung
up
when
he
returned
from
a
walk
the
red
message
light
was
blinking
joe
thanks
for
asking
but
no
i
not
an
adventure
she
made
an
amused
sound
call
me
again
sometime
when
you
grown
up
click
joe
called
back
immediately
hi
i
grew
up
he
said
when
she
answered
a
woman
on
tv
just
explained
it
to
me
you
have
to
transcend
the
grieving
child
within
hmmm
mo
said
pie
joe
continued
what
the
name
of
that
place
on
hausten
street
where
they
have
great
pie
the
place
with
a
fish
pond
the
willows
back
in
time
i
afraid
you
have
to
go
back
in
time
to
eat
there
they
closed
two
or
three
years
ago
damn
how
about
keo
tomorrow
or
thereabouts
his
best
offer
you
have
to
be
seriously
repulsed
by
someone
to
turn
down
keo
ulua
with
black
bean
sauce
i
going
to
regret
this
she
said
great
no
i
mean
we
have
a
nice
lunch
see
you
there
joe
bailed
before
she
could
change
her
mind
joe
put
down
his
fork
lemon
grass
he
said
with
satisfaction
mo
was
eating
rapidly
she
raised
her
eyebrows
so
what
have
you
been
up
to
she
asked
breaking
off
a
piece
of
spring
roll
i
bought
a
computer
ughh
joe
laughed
i
hate
them
really
but
they
good
tools
i
bought
it
for
the
internet
so
i
can
trade
stocks
i
remembering
mo
said
between
bites
what
they
say
about
how
to
make
a
small
fortune
on
wall
street
how
that
well
you
start
with
a
large
one
ha
ha
that
one
method
i
ca
use
i
should
have
eaten
breakfast
she
said
what
is
the
damned
internet
anyway
mo
i
have
to
warn
you
the
last
ten
people
that
asked
me
questions
like
that
are
lying
face
down
i
can
take
it
she
said
it
a
way
of
moving
information
around
joe
said
that
require
a
dedicated
phone
line
the
telephone
system
works
like
a
string
stretched
between
tin
cans
two
people
monopolize
the
string
until
they
done
the
internet
is
different
info
is
coded
and
split
into
small
packets
each
packet
is
numbered
and
addressed
it
heads
toward
its
destination
by
any
route
that
is
open
it
does
have
to
travel
with
its
sister
packets
a
program
at
the
receiving
end
collects
the
packets
and
reassembles
them
correctly
no
need
to
dedicate
one
string
to
one
conversation
at
a
time
joe
paused
for
breath
the
internet
is
a
lot
of
fat
strings
with
packets
zipping
through
each
year
the
strings
get
fatter
and
the
packets
zip
faster
where
did
you
learn
this
stuff
right
up
the
road
at
the
university
i
actually
have
a
degree
in
it
you
do
look
the
type
mo
said
you
say
the
nicest
things
the
internet
is
here
to
stay
years
ago
when
i
was
a
student
i
typed
an
algebra
equation
into
a
computer
it
was
beamed
from
an
antenna
on
top
of
the
engineering
building
to
a
satellite
and
then
down
to
an
antenna
at
mit
in
massachusetts
a
few
seconds
later
blak
blak
blak
the
answer
came
out
of
the
printer
back
from
mit
that
was
state
of
the
art
a
marvel
now
my
god
joe
paused
i
going
to
make
money
on
it
is
that
what
you
want
to
do
joe
make
money
some
anyway
what
do
you
really
like
to
do
mo
took
a
mouthful
of
rice
her
eyes
were
wide
open
looking
directly
at
him
uh
i
like
to
write
about
things
aha
she
said
how
do
you
get
by
he
asked
i
do
all
right
with
photography
commercial
work
i
teach
a
couple
of
courses
when
i
get
the
chance
i
do
my
own
stuff
i
have
a
show
every
couple
of
years
if
i
can
the
only
photographer
besides
ansel
adams
and
that
i
can
remember
is
the
hungarian
guy
kertesz
mo
looked
at
him
sharply
his
pictures
of
new
york
are
so
still
joe
said
like
etchings
but
they
awake
there
is
always
something
tracks
in
the
snow
a
falling
leaf
something
that
echoes
time
wonderful
she
agreed
i
love
his
early
paris
shots
you
know
about
kertesz
you
full
of
surprises
my
father
is
a
painter
so
you
grew
up
with
it
actually
i
was
raised
by
my
grandparents
my
mother
died
when
i
was
a
kid
did
you
ever
hear
of
franz
griessler
the
painter
yes
i
seen
some
of
his
work
i
met
him
once
want
to
hear
about
it
sure
how
about
dessert
absolutely
they
ordered
i
used
to
drive
a
charley
cab
a
woman
flagged
me
down
in
the
shopping
center
one
day
she
was
holding
a
flat
package
in
both
hands
wiggling
her
fingers
she
was
slim
intense
in
her
late
thirties
with
high
coloring
and
black
hair
pulled
into
a
bun
she
was
damned
good
looking
hapa
asian
french
maybe
she
lived
nearby
just
behind
the
pagoda
but
the
package
was
clumsy
to
carry
it
was
a
drawing
of
hers
we
got
to
talking
and
she
asked
if
i
ever
modeled
had
you
nope
she
talked
me
into
it
the
next
day
i
drove
her
to
franz
griessler
studio
way
up
the
mountain
on
round
top
drive
and
sat
for
her
drawing
class
what
was
he
like
short
square
close
cut
gray
hair
powerful
guy
lili
that
was
her
name
told
me
afterwards
that
he
was
hard
to
believe
i
was
very
tense
at
first
i
thought
for
a
few
minutes
that
i
could
do
it
could
just
sit
there
with
people
looking
at
me
drops
of
sweat
started
to
form
over
my
eyebrows
i
wanted
to
run
away
but
something
happened
i
began
to
enjoy
listening
to
the
charcoal
scratching
and
the
small
noises
people
made
as
they
concentrated
the
sweat
disappeared
i
felt
part
of
a
tradition
i
felt
that
i
belonged
the
waitress
brought
dessert
and
cleared
the
table
at
break
time
franz
showed
me
his
studio
he
was
working
on
a
portrait
a
seated
matron
silver
hair
a
lot
of
greens
sage
purple
lilac
colors
her
hands
were
partially
sketched
folded
in
her
lap
a
diagonal
grid
of
pencil
lines
mapped
the
unpainted
portions
of
the
canvas
into
large
diamonds
the
jewelry
always
the
jewelry
i
hate
it
franz
said
looking
at
indications
of
bracelets
and
rings
i
asked
him
what
the
pencil
lines
were
for
composition
always
i
start
with
them
joe
stretched
and
finished
his
coconut
banana
dessert
mo
looked
thoughtful
what
became
of
the
babe
i
saw
her
across
the
street
a
few
weeks
later
i
do
think
she
noticed
me
every
so
often
i
look
at
the
mountain
and
remember
that
studio
especially
at
night
you
can
see
a
couple
of
lights
way
up
there
you
know
what
i
keep
seeing
he
answered
his
own
question
those
diagonal
pencil
lines
mmm
mo
pushed
her
plate
away
thank
you
joe
it
was
a
nice
lunch
as
they
left
the
restaurant
she
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
when
the
going
gets
tough
the
tough
get
going
right
she
was
looking
at
him
as
though
he
were
a
sixth
grader
right
he
said
and
they
went
in
different
directions
on
kapahulu
avenue
joe
took
the
long
way
home
around
the
zoo
and
through
waikiki
he
did
know
what
to
make
of
mo
she
was
a
good
listener
she
seem
to
be
involved
with
anyone
it
was
a
shame
to
let
that
body
of
hers
go
to
waste
joe
had
started
the
day
at
to
catch
the
market
opening
on
the
east
coast
by
the
time
he
got
back
he
was
tired
and
already
anticipating
the
next
day
trading
precious
metals
were
hot
he
was
making
money
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
in
cyberspace
of
claude
ogier
a
knowledgeable
gold
bug
from
quebec
who
issued
a
constant
stream
of
communications
about
the
latest
mining
developments
claude
was
preparing
to
launch
a
newsletter
working
into
it
joe
was
up
in
six
weeks
by
following
his
advice
southwest
precious
metals
was
attracting
a
lot
of
interest
they
claimed
an
area
of
desert
basin
that
was
filled
to
a
depth
of
meters
with
material
eroded
from
an
adjacent
range
a
mountainous
area
that
had
been
mined
for
gold
in
the
last
century
the
deposit
known
as
dirt
contained
gold
silver
and
platinum
in
small
concentrations
small
that
is
by
the
ounce
by
the
square
kilometer
southwest
was
sitting
on
the
find
of
the
decade
the
problem
lay
in
the
extraction
there
a
lot
of
gold
in
the
pacific
too
in
the
salt
water
but
no
one
has
figured
out
how
to
extract
it
economically
arguments
raged
on
the
internet
gold
and
platinum
are
rarely
found
in
the
same
deposit
conventional
fire
assay
methods
are
ineffective
on
desert
dirt
the
samples
could
have
been
fraudulently
salted
a
prestigious
independent
auditor
was
engaged
to
evaluate
the
deposit
various
explanations
were
advanced
to
counter
the
objections
seasoned
investors
said
that
these
companies
were
scams
nineteen
times
out
of
twenty
so
why
bother
at
all
optimists
brought
up
investor
resistance
to
heap
leaching
an
extraction
method
that
had
made
fortunes
in
the
several
mutual
funds
bought
big
positions
after
sending
their
mining
aces
to
investigate
first
hand
the
price
was
beginning
to
rise
on
larger
volume
the
day
after
joe
had
lunch
with
mo
he
bought
shares
of
spm
at
the
next
morning
the
price
was
bid
asked
a
press
release
announced
that
an
experimental
extraction
technique
had
yielded
results
that
were
higher
than
expected
tests
were
continuing
with
larger
samples
joe
jumped
on
the
ask
and
bought
more
shares
damn
it
batman
we
got
a
live
one
the
price
spiked
to
before
profit
taking
knocked
it
down
it
closed
at
after
heavy
trading
for
several
months
the
price
continued
to
move
up
as
larger
samples
processed
with
the
new
technique
yielded
consistently
higher
results
he
bought
more
shares
at
when
the
price
rose
over
claude
shocked
the
online
bulls
by
selling
most
of
his
shares
but
claude
joe
wrote
if
the
extraction
method
is
as
cheap
as
most
people
think
it
will
be
shares
will
go
to
easy
to
him
do
worry
mon
ami
claude
answered
i
still
have
a
position
if
that
comes
to
be
i
have
my
original
investment
returned
with
a
profit
and
my
heart
keeps
the
normal
beat
joe
thought
about
buying
more
but
held
back
one
detail
bothered
him
the
ceo
a
thirty
year
mining
pro
claimed
to
have
a
degree
from
an
obscure
college
in
the
northwest
several
investors
had
tried
unsuccessfully
to
verify
this
joe
the
company
to
inquire
but
received
no
answer
kate
had
an
academic
friend
in
seattle
who
checked
and
was
unable
to
find
a
record
of
graduation
the
closest
any
one
could
come
was
to
determine
that
he
had
gone
to
school
there
for
at
least
three
years
the
college
had
gone
through
many
changes
over
the
years
degree
requirements
were
different
records
had
been
moved
many
times
they
failed
to
pin
it
down
joe
did
care
whether
or
not
someone
had
a
degree
it
is
what
one
can
do
that
matters
but
he
cared
if
someone
lied
about
it
lying
is
a
bad
sign
spm
stock
broke
above
and
began
to
correct
the
short
sellers
piled
on
selling
borrowed
stock
driving
the
price
down
in
order
to
frighten
investors
into
dumping
their
shares
the
price
held
in
the
range
for
a
few
weeks
and
then
quickly
fell
to
and
then
the
short
position
grew
larger
by
the
day
the
bulls
argued
that
all
those
borrowed
shares
had
to
be
bought
back
sooner
or
later
and
that
the
upcoming
positive
mining
audit
would
trigger
a
massive
short
squeeze
that
would
quickly
put
the
price
over
the
company
continued
to
release
good
news
when
the
audit
report
was
finally
released
it
verified
only
the
original
assay
results
a
year
old
and
made
no
mention
of
the
extraction
yields
the
company
made
bland
assurances
about
ongoing
efforts
to
improve
the
extraction
technique
but
there
were
no
hard
numbers
and
they
were
running
out
of
development
capital
trading
in
spm
was
suspended
when
it
resumed
the
stock
cratered
to
below
in
seconds
joe
waited
for
a
bounce
clamped
his
jaw
and
sold
out
at
just
below
the
high
of
the
day
over
the
next
few
months
the
price
dropped
to
a
nickel
and
the
company
went
bankrupt
joe
was
in
shock
he
had
lost
plus
commissions
half
his
savings
as
he
thought
it
over
he
realized
the
mistakes
he
made
he
broken
the
primary
law
of
diversity
you
should
never
have
all
your
eggs
in
one
basket
secondly
he
had
wavered
between
the
attitudes
of
the
trader
and
the
long
term
investor
ignoring
the
safeguards
of
each
approach
if
you
are
trading
you
must
wait
for
good
entry
points
and
you
must
exit
immediately
if
the
price
moves
against
you
gains
more
than
compensate
for
losses
if
the
losses
are
strictly
limited
furthermore
victor
sperandeo
had
cautioned
never
to
give
back
more
than
half
your
profits
they
are
too
hard
to
come
by
at
one
point
joe
had
been
ahead
it
hurt
to
remember
if
you
are
a
long
term
investor
on
the
other
hand
you
must
know
that
the
company
is
sound
joe
failed
to
follow
through
on
his
investigation
of
the
ceo
he
had
been
too
cheap
to
go
to
the
annual
meeting
where
he
would
not
have
found
the
qualities
he
looked
for
in
management
he
had
been
neither
trader
nor
investor
he
had
been
a
loser
not
only
that
he
had
spent
months
staring
into
his
monitor
living
on
the
internet
reading
the
wall
journal
every
day
and
barrons
every
weekend
and
dreaming
about
how
he
would
invest
he
asked
himself
how
he
could
have
been
so
stupid
so
inept
he
went
to
a
korean
bar
gorgeous
women
paraded
continuously
past
his
table
when
he
tired
of
sitting
with
one
the
next
slid
in
against
him
and
put
her
hand
on
his
leg
buy
me
drink
you
want
the
music
was
loud
hypnotic
they
danced
they
accepted
mastercard
joe
staggered
home
with
further
losses
he
was
in
deepest
shambles
when
the
phone
rang
ugh
hlo
hi
joe
max

it

it
all

max
said
smiling
right
right
always
wanted
to
go
there
supposed
to
be
a
great
place
the
kiwi
man
awesome
max
was
short
with
wide
shoulders
and
large
dark
brown
eyes
he
had
filled
out
since
his
school
days
but
he
had
the
same
earnest
expression
max
had
gotten
through
the
university
of
vermont
studying
this
and
that
anthropology
mostly
but
he
gone
walkabout
instead
of
buckling
down
to
graduate
school
joe
had
been
glad
at
the
time
and
now
he
could
see
why
max
was
calmer
more
sure
of
himself
after
a
couple
of
years
of
knocking
around
let
go
get
some
breakfast
lunch
max
said
at
the
coffee
shop
on
king
street
joe
asked
remember
that
week
we
spent
on
kauai
that
was
a
good
time
yeah
the
na
pali
coast
max
said
some
place
joe
said
the
whole
damn
island
should
be
a
world
park
i
remember
that
story
you
told
us
about
the
leper
who
would
go
to
the
colony
koolau
joe
said
he
defeated
the
british
navy
they
could
get
him
he
warned
them
too
one
sick
guy
with
a
rifle
against
marines
and
cannon
he
killed
what
three
of
them
before
they
gave
up
he
was
doing
anything
just
he
and
his
lover
in
the
valley
yeah
max
said
one
of
the
great
love
stories
joe
said
made
for
hollywood
she
stayed
with
him
until
he
died
and
never
caught
leprosy
a
few
years
later
she
climbed
back
over
the
pali
and
started
all
over
again
lived
a
long
life
if
i
were
a
drinking
man
i
propose
a
toast
to
her
and
all
women
like
her
women
max
said
just
like
a
grown
up
holding
out
his
coffee
mug
they
clinked
mugs
so
what
next
joe
asked
i
been
thinking
look
at
this
max
reached
into
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
little
wooden
box
deep
red
with
a
dramatic
black
grain
he
removed
a
rubber
band
placed
the
box
on
the
table
and
lifted
off
the
top
the
box
was
rectangular
with
an
oval
center
a
thin
piece
of
stone
lay
in
the
oval
tawny
and
flaked
it
an
arrowhead
found
it
in
vermont
joe
put
the
arrowhead
in
his
palm
and
looked
at
the
indentations
near
the
base
and
at
the
rounded
but
definite
point
the
slight
weight
of
it
shocked
him
whoever
made
it
had
felt
the
same
weight
it
had
been
in
his
or
her
palm
as
well
i
carried
it
around
in
my
wallet
and
then
when
i
was
in
new
zealand
i
made
the
box
out
of
kauri
wood
beautiful
wood
joe
said
the
oval
is
perfect
for
the
arrowhead
max
nodded
i
going
to
make
things
he
said
that
what
i
want
to
do
furniture
maybe
good
idea
joe
put
the
arrowhead
back
in
its
box
i
going
to
stop
and
see
kate
when
i
get
to
the
mainland
max
said
check
out
her
new
boyfriend
jackson
he
into
working
with
his
hands

guy
joe
had
an
idea

island
max
was
starting
to
look
excited
it
registered
and
the
insurance
is
good
for
another
six
or
seven
months
here
joe
found
the
registration
in
his
wallet
and
gave
it
to
him
just
take
this
that
way
all
you
have
to
do
is
put
gas
in
it
and
go
when
it
expires
i
send

a
bill
of

a
bed
in
the
back
too
really
sure
keep
the
tools
just
leave
my
clothes
at
kate
max
sat
back
and
considered
he
stretched
his
arm
forward
and
slowly
slid
the
arrowhead
across
the
table
swap
he
said
oh
max
i
ca
max
shook
his
head
that
the
deal
well
joe
put
the
top
on
the
box
wrapped
the
rubber
band
around
it
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
they
walked
to
waikiki
and
hung
out
for
another
day
before
max
caught
a
plane
to
seattle
at
the
airport
joe
thought
of
mo
and
asked
max
if
he
ever
had
a
professor
at
vermont
named
soule
soule
sounds
familiar
an
old
guy
yeah
soule
he
gave
a
couple
of
guest
lectures
in
an
economics
class
i
remember
now
he
was
steamed
about
the
romans
they
had
tax
laws
that
screwed
everything
up
then
the
currency
collapsed
he
was
interesting
about
that
his
daughter
lives
here
i
met
her
by
accident
max
flight
was
announced
for
boarding
there
it
is
joe
said
sorry
to
see
you
go
but
you
headed
in
the
right
direction
that
a
joke
you
see
a
cookie
fortune
taped
to
the
dash
in
the
truck
that
what
it
says
but
you
are
actually
listen
that
truck
has
two
gas
tanks
there
a
switch
you
see
it
joe
thanks
take
care
of
yourself
man
you
too
max
and
he
was
gone
that
the
way
it
is
with
kids
joe
thought
damn
it
batman
he
said
when
he
got
home
much
later
that
day
you
and
me
they
do
have
a
chance
that
night
he
dreamt
of
a
campfire
and
coyotes
calling
in
the
night
two
girls
with
clear
asian
faces
and
long
black
hair
were
waiting
at
a
bus
stop
on
king
street
one
was
about
fourteen
carrying
school
books
the
other
was
several
years
older
heavier
joe
stopped
at
coco
ordered
coffee
and
tried
to
describe
the
girls
in
a
notebook
they
were
so
beautiful
so
similar
sisters
maybe
yet
different
the
older
was
a
woman
really
hours
went
by
like
minutes
as
he
searched
for
the
right
words
he
wandered
into
waikiki
and
sat
on
a
bench
by
the
beach
a
woman
with
smooth
brown
skin
walked
into
the
water
her
body
was
like
a
torpedo
in
a
blue
one
piece
suit
she
went
out
a
few
yards
waited
and
dove
quietly
under
a
bobbing
up
on
the
other
side
the
locals
live
in
the
water
joe
thought
they
do
fight
it
he
remembered
a
story
in
the
advertiser
about
a
sampan
that
sank
in
the
pacific
a
fisherman
rescued
hours
later
was
asked
by
a
reporter
what
did
you
do
all
that
time
out
there
with
no
life
jacket
wen
sleep
when
i
got
tired
he
said
he
was
one
of
those
big
laughing
hawaiians
who
float
like
buoys
heads
up
out
of
the
water
joe
strolled
through
the
zoo
the
gorilla
was
famous
he
sat
near
the
front
of
his
cage
mugging
at
tourists
carrying
on
drawing
them
closer
as
they
took
pictures
locals
grinned
from
the
sides
when
enough
people
had
gathered
the
gorilla
would
sneak
one
hand
behind
and
below
him
and
without
warning
blast
the
tourists
with
a
shit
ball
that
hit
the
bars
and
scattered
for
maximum
effect
he
would
leap
to
his
feet
mightily
pleased
as
the
crowd
screamed
and
the
locals
bent
over
laughing
the
elephants
were
patient
and
knowing
joe
trusted
elephants
and
dolphins
sometimes
he
walked
all
the
way
to
the
kahala
to
watch
the
dolphins
zoom
around
their
salt
water
pool
they
came
right
to
him
at
the
edge
of
the
pool
wiggling
excited
as
puppies
he
walked
up
kapahulu
avenue
and
stopped
at
zippy
where
he
had
a
bowl
of
saimin
and
worked
on
the
description
of
the
two
girls
at
home
in
the
mail
there
was
a
card
from
mo
announcing
a
show
of
her
photographs
the
print
on
the
card
was
deeply
silvered
it
showed
the
base
of
a
banyan
tree
by
a
bus
stop
high
roots
radiated
out
and
sank
below
the
sidewalk
a
man
was
asleep
cradled
between
two
roots
a
lunch
box
by
his
waist
one
arm
stretched
out
along
the
top
of
a
root
fingers
dangling
the
angles
of
his
knees
and
elbows
blending
with
the
bends
in
the
roots
not
bad
batman
joe
said
next
friday
the
days
before
mo
opening
passed
quickly
on
friday
joe
walked
down
ward
avenue
to
a
gallery
and
camera
shop
and
for
once
he
early
empty
wine
bottles
a
few
pupus
on
bare
trays
a
glass
punch
bowl
paper
cups
and
napkins
were
scattered
across
white
tables
conversation
hummed
and
collided
around
the
room
a
blues
guitar
kept
time
in
the
background
mo
was
smiling
down
at
a
bearded
professorial
type
how
do
you
do
a
young
japanese
man
shook
joe
hand
thanks
for
the
invitation
joe
said
flashing
the
card
are
you
a
friend
of
winifred
yes
joe
burke
wendell
sasaki
nice
place
you
have
here
joe
said
a
couple
entered
and
wendell
excused
himself
joe
drifted
along
a
wall
of
photographs
there
were
several
of
old
sugar
mill
buildings
and
one
taken
of
the
sky
through
the
branches
of
a
koa
tree
there
was
a
large
one
of
the
city
at
night
lights
running
high
up
the
ridges
his
favorite
showed
two
young
women
walking
toward
the
camera
on
kalakaua
avenue
the
light
was
gray
one
had
her
arm
around
the
other
shoulders
they
were
bent
forward
laughing
their
bodies
and
clothes
were
used
and
tired
but
their
faces
were
innocent
flooded
with
relief
the
night
was
over
most
of
the
subjects
were
conventional
it
was
the
detail
and
the
light
on
them
that
was
interesting
they
were
all
black
and
white
but
one
a
of
bamboo
stalks
and
leaves
what
do
you
think
mo
asked
from
behind
him
i
like
it
joe
turned
partially
how
come
it
the
only
one
in
color
i
have
problems
with
color
mo
said
it
always
off
but
in
this
case
there
are
really
only
two
colors
bamboo
and
that
tender
green
they
both
off
in
the
same
way
so
the
relationship
works
and
the
color
is
so
much
of
the
story
wendell
sasaki
called
her
over
to
confer
with
the
couple
joe
stood
in
front
of
the
picture
of
the
young
hookers
if
that
what
they
were
looking
at
them
seemed
more
helpful
than
talking
to
anyone
mo
worked
the
crowd
after
a
time
joe
thanked
the
owner
waved
at
mo
and
left
all
artists
love
light
he
thought
walking
up
ward
avenue
mo
was
no
exception
the
next
day
he
called
mo
nice
show
thanks
you
have
won
the
joe
burke
award
excellence
in
photography
why
never
did
i
dream
she
said
in
a
southern
drawl
lunch
joe
honey
she
dropped
the
drawl
i
busy
today
let
see
how
about
tuesday
i
want
to
check
something
out
on
the
windward
side
we
could
eat
over
there
good
deal
on
tuesday
she
picked
him
up
by
the
sandbox
on
the
lower
level
of
the
shopping
center
as
they
drove
toward
the
pali
joe
said
sentimental
about
that
sandbox
kate
used
to
play
there
he
was
surprised
to
see
pain
flicker
on
mo
face
what
the
matter
i
had
a
child
once
he
died
when
he
was
two
from
a
condition
my
husband
forgot
to
tell
me
ran
in
his
family
his
nerves
did
work
how
awful
i
do
think
about
it
much
mo
said
they
were
silent
for
a
few
minutes
so
what
have
you
been
doing
losing
money
i
got
completely
involved
in
the
market
i
made
a
major
mistake
but
i
learned
a
lot
i
show
you
where
i
took
the
bamboo
picture
she
said
turning
onto
the
old
pali
road
she
turned
again
and
stopped
by
a
weathered
concrete
bridge
they
got
out
and
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
where
a
tall
grove
had
grown
from
the
bank
below
mo
put
her
elbows
on
the
side
wall
of
the
bridge
and
leaned
out
midway
up
the
grove
joe
leaned
out
beside
her
a
breeze
stirred
and
they
were
enveloped
by
melodious
knocking
a
hundred
percussionists
set
free
wow
joe
said
a
bamboo
orchestra
i
never
heard
that
before
they
listened
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
drove
through
the
pali
tunnel
emerging
high
over
kaneohe
bay
planes
of
pure
light
green
turquoise
dark
blue
just
another
day
in
paradise
he
said
kailua
is
paradise
exactly
i
got
to
stop
a
moment
in
town
and
then
we
go
over
to
kaneohe
sure
they
wound
down
off
the
pali
and
joe
waited
while
mo
accomplished
her
errand
she
drove
along
oneawa
street
past
the
racquet
club
joe
pointed
see
that
hedge
i
planted
it
a
tall
oleander
hedge
curved
along
the
club
drive
a
hundred
small
bushes
joe
said
took
me
almost
all
day
your
roots
in
hawaii
yok
i
used
to
live
there
with
sally
and
kate
i
was
the
manager
how
old
is
kate
hard
to
believe
where
are
we
going
tops
that
pretty
exciting
we
can
eat
breakfast
again
i
hope
she
there
a
picture
i
thinking
about
mo
pulled
into
the
tops
parking
lot
and
they
sat
at
the
counter
joe
did
need
to
look
at
the
plastic
menu
he
read
it
dozens
of
times
in
the
ala
moana
tops
a
tall
woman
wearing
a
cook
apron
stood
in
front
of
the
grill
her
black
hair
gathered
behind
her
head
was
held
by
a
tortoise
shell
comb
her
face
was
long
and
utterly
calm
eggs
homefries
and
burgers
sizzled
in
front
of
her
she
dropped
slices
of
bread
into
an
industrial
toaster
flipped
and
scrambled
stirred
and
buttered
served
and
cleaned
with
untroubled
movements
of
her
arms
and
hands
occasionally
she
turned
or
moved
a
step
sideways
without
changing
expression
she
was
like
a
reflection
of
herself
in
a
still
pond
something
else
joe
said
how
am
i
going
to
get
a
picture
of
that
mo
asked
i
do
know
mo
swiveled
on
her
stool
i
got
to
stop
staring
you
could
ask
her
to
model
i
suppose
so
but
then
you
mean
in
some
other
setting
yeah
joe
said
naked
in
a
waterfall
i
help
mo
ignored
him
part
of
it
is
the
contrast
with
the
grill
but
all
this
other
clutter
joe
shook
his
head
how
can
she
be
so
busy
and
so
serene
at
the
same
time
i
do
think
i
can
catch
it
mo
said
but
i
going
to
try
jade
willow
lady
joe
said
on
the
way
back
over
the
pali
what
i
call
her
i
have
to
admit
mo
i
like
looking
at
things
why
do
we
go
over
to
kauai
some
time
day
trip
catch
an
early
plane
drive
around
look
at
things
and
be
back
by
dinner
mo
pursed
her
lips
and
i
have
a
client
over
there
i
could
write
it
off
it
would
be
nice
to
see
the
canyon
i
have
to
go
to
the
mainland
next
week
how
about
the
week
after
say
friday
that
would
give
me
time
to
get
something
done
before
we
went
sounds
good
closest
flight
to
seven
two
weeks
from
friday
which
airline
mo
asked
i
do
know
aloha
it
easier
for
my
books
if
i
get
my
own
ticket
she
said
great
if
i
do
hear
from
you
i
see
you
at
the
terminal
good
luck
with
jade
willow
lady
mo
dropped
him
off
at
the
shopping
center
and
drove
into
traffic
without
looking
back
he
took
the
escalator
to
the
upper
level
and
walked
into
shirokya
drawn
by
japanese
muzak
and
pretty
packaging
the
japanese
were
incapable
of
bad
design
he
thought
it
was
in
their
genes
or
something
or
maybe
it
was
just
that
they
cared
he
almost
bought
a
porcelain
doll
to
keep
batman
company
on
the
lanai
but
he
decided
that
might
be
pushy
he
called
aloha
and
bought
a
ticket
for
the
flight
to
kauai
he
and
mo
had
agreed
on
a
return
time
but
the
seemed
most
likely
it
was
nearing
pupu
hour
at
the
chart
house
he
walked
over
in
time
to
get
a
table
by
the
open
windows
ordered
a
glenlivet
and
stretched
out
to
enjoy
the
view
of
masts
in
the
marina
the
trade
wind
kept
up
an
aluminum
chatter
not
as
nice
as
the
spirit
of
the
bamboo
grove
but
pleasant
in
its
own
way
at
the
next
table
three
boat
owners
in
their
thirties
were
drinking
talking
story
and
laughing
loudly
as
the
first
group
of
well
dressed
office
women
came
through
the
door
one
of
the
men
leaned
back
in
his
chair
a
grin
spread
his
mustache
across
his
red
face
bogeys
three
he
announced
the
squadron
adjusted
for
combat
most
would
become
prisoners
of
war
joe
thought
he
been
one
himself
not
unhappily
perhaps
it
was
the
habit
of
being
coupled
that
was
pushing
him
in
mo
direction
she
was
as
natural
as
sally
his
first
wife
or
as
cheerful
as
ingrid
she
was
more
independent
focused
more
like
him
in
some
ways
too
bad
about
her
child
that
explained
some
of
the
seriousness
in
her
face
she
was
bowled
over
by
the
great
joe
burke
but
she
was
interested
he
pulled
back
on
the
stick
and
began
to
climb
if
a
globe
is
turned
in
just
the
right
way
nothing
can
be
seen
but
the
pacific
and
the
far
off
edges
of
continents
the
hawaiian
islands
are
specks
in
the
middle
of
this
immensity
kauai
is
a
hundred
miles
from
oahu
practically
next
door
the
aloha
airlines
jet
climbed
and
then
descended
into
lihue
before
joe
had
time
to
finish
a
glass
of
juice
green
sugar
cane
and
red
earth
swept
past
lowering
wings
a
bump
a
screech
of
tires
and
they
were
down
taxiing
to
the
small
terminal
mo
put
away
a
small
day
planner
in
which
she
had
been
making
notes
canyon
first
she
asked
banana
pancakes
hard
to
explore
on
an
empty
stomach
i
brought
some
fruit
she
said
they
rented
a
toyota
sedan
and
joe
drove
into
lihue
too
early
for
saimin
he
said
too
bad
there
a
great
place
hamura
biz
people
from
honolulu
have
been
known
to
fly
over
for
lunch
to
cure
their
hangovers
he
parked
by
kenny
this
wo
take
long
they
ordered
breakfast
when
i
lived
here
joe
said
there
was
only
one
traffic
light
on
the
island
and
it
was
on
a
highway
it
was
in
the
middle
of
a
cane
field
for
the
trucks
it
changing
fast
mo
said
too
beautiful
not
to
be
discovered
if
they
stop
the
sugar
subsidies
it
all
over
joe
pushed
his
empty
plate
away
mo
was
wearing
a
black
sweatshirt
tan
jeans
and
running
shoes
he
had
on
his
filson
bush
jacket
levis
and
his
all
purpose
clarks
shoes
they
looked
good
together
he
thought
and
ms
competent
did
you
notice
the
kentucky
fried
chicken
place
on
the
way
in
to
lihue
he
asked
yes
i
helped
landscape
it
me
and
whistling
ed
swaney
he
was
a
sheriff
in
he
quit
after
the
watts
riots
he
had
a
whistling
show
on
a
radio
station
over
there
fifteen
minutes
a
week
really
yup
he
was
a
mighty
muscle
man
thirty
years
older
than
i
was
i
could
barely
keep
up
with
him
the
good
thing
about
whistling
ed
was
that
he
did
talk
much
giving
you
free
rein
yok
no
i
did
talk
either
so
we
got
along
well
anyway
we
went
from
one
posh
house
to
the
next
cutting
grass
and
trimming
trees
the
owners
treated
him
with
great
respect
i
finally
figured
out
why
he
was
always
sweating
i
gave
it
a
name
swaney
law
if
sweating
they
ca
shit
on
you
they
drove
down
to
nawiliwili
harbor
and
along
a
back
road
through
cane
fields
that
followed
a
line
of
mountains
narrow
green
valleys
cut
into
the
mountains
mysteriously
shaded
there
was
a
sense
of
two
cultures
of
a
border
at
the
edge
of
the
sugar
cane
that
was
crossed
cautiously
if
at
all
they
came
to
the
poipu
resort
district
and
then
headed
up
to
the
canyon
rim
where
joe
had
picked
plums
they
stood
at
the
lookout
above
a
three
thousand
foot
drop
and
ten
miles
of
rugged
red
and
gold
walls
flecked
with
green
mountain
goats
bits
of
white
chased
each
other
up
and
down
vertical
slopes
incredible
mo
said
focusing
her
camera
it
looks
like
they
playing
tag
joe
said
so
free
they
drove
to
the
end
of
the
road
and
peered
into
the
mist
obscuring
kalalau
valley
where
koolau
the
leper
remained
buried
clouds
swirled
and
lifted
revealing
glimpses
of
tree
tops
steep
ridges
and
once
a
small
curve
of
beach
far
below
i
almost
like
it
better
this
way
mo
said
when
you
ca
see
it
all
at
once
brrrrr
they
piled
into
the
car
and
drove
back
down
to
the
sunny
fields
on
the
leeward
side
they
passed
through
road
cuts
hundreds
of
yards
of
flaming
bougainvillea
on
both
sides
and
by
small
plantation
houses
painted
green
corrugated
roofs
rusted
to
the
same
red
tones
as
the
soil
stop
mo
commanded
from
time
to
time
joe
stretched
while
she
took
pictures
they
drove
through
the
built
up
area
between
lihue
and
kapaa
and
parked
outside
a
medical
complex
five
minutes
ten
maybe
mo
said
the
client
she
explained
when
she
returned
rob
wilcox
he
a
fan
buys
my
stuff
for
his
clinic
and
for
his
own
collection
great
joe
said
is
there
a
mrs
wilcox
no
she
flushed
slightly
they
parked
by
the
beach
in
anahola
ate
bananas
and
an
orange
and
decided
to
stretch
their
legs
mo
walked
strangely
on
the
sand
holding
her
shoes
in
one
hand
her
pelvis
tipped
back
she
shifted
her
weight
stiffly
from
one
leg
to
the
other
in
an
exaggerated
prance
that
said
you
should
be
so
lucky
as
to
even
look
at
me
but
no
one
else
was
on
the
beach
she
did
seem
conscious
of
the
change
joe
looked
away
curled
peacefully
along
the
beach
as
far
as
he
could
see
they
sat
on
the
soft
sand
and
mo
took
off
her
sweatshirt
joe
lay
back
with
his
head
on
his
shoes
and
admired
her
breasts
high
and
shapely
beneath
a
gray
steady
he
said
to
himself
the
woman
barely
likes
you
who
was
she
anyway
she
took
good
pictures
he
knew
that
he
fell
asleep
for
a
moment
mo
took
over
the
driving
they
were
well
around
the
island
past
kilauea
when
joe
asked
the
tahiti
nui
do
you
know
it
in
hanalei
a
restaurant
bar
yup
with
a
porch
i
want
to
have
a
beer
on
the
porch
mo
looked
at
her
watch
plenty
of
time
joe
said
which
flight
are
you
on
she
said
mine
is
quarter
to
six
we
still
have
time
maybe
i
can
get
on
the
early
one
they
drove
over
a
stream
that
curved
through
sparkling
green
rice
paddies
shortly
afterwards
they
stopped
by
the
tahiti
nui
they
sat
on
a
wooden
porch
and
looked
across
the
humpy
patched
blacktop
road
to
a
steep
hillside
densely
green
and
silent
happiness
joe
said
touching
mo
glass
with
his
by
some
accounts
hawaii
is
the
most
isolated
land
mass
in
the
world
kauai
is
the
farthest
out
of
the
inhabited
islands
and
here
we
are
at
the
end
of
the
road
it
stops
right
over
there
ca
make
it
around
the
na
pali
coast
he
drank
his
beer
and
waved
at
the
view
is
it
great
mo
end
of
the
road
go
any
farther
how
relaxing
can
you
get
nowhere
to
go
but
back
when
we
feel
like
it
at
three
mo
said
she
took
a
picture
of
the
road
and
one
of
an
orange
cat
curled
on
an
old
sofa
next
to
the
table
i
had
a
cat
like
that
once
joe
said
she
turned
and
took
one
of
him
joe
burke
at
the
end
of
the
road
she
offered
in
explanation
a
long
way
from
where
i
started
you
were
from
woodstock
right
joe
nodded
were
you
at
the
festival
no
i
was
running
a
laundromat
that
year
i
leased
it
from
an
old
friend
whose
wife
was
sick
of
cleaning
it
i
could
get
away
it
was
no
big
deal
there
had
been
little
festivals
for
years
we
called
them
music
all
night
sleep
in
a
field
i
had
no
idea
it
was
going
to
be
so
huge
and
anyway
it
was
actually
in
woodstock
it
was
about
forty
miles
away
did
you
go
i
could
mo
said
i
was
in
vienna
in
a
convent
school
my
father
was
on
sabbatical
it
was
awful
my
sister
beth
was
already
in
college
i
wish
i
could
have
heard
jimi
hendrix
spangled
a
major
moment
joe
said
when
hendrix
died
the
hot
radio
station
in
honolulu
scheduled
that
piece
for
twelve
noon
they
asked
everyone
to
open
their
windows
and
crank
up
the
volume
that
was
when
i
was
driving
a
cab
you
could
hear
hendrix
blasting
all
over
the
city
mo
looked
at
her
watch
again
it
that
time
joe
damn
shame
he
said
they
said
goodbye
to
the
cat
and
mo
drove
them
back
to
lihue
where
joe
had
no
trouble
changing
his
flight
fun
day
he
said
as
they
parted
in
honolulu
bye
joe
she
smiled
i
call
you
she
lifted
a
hand
in
acknowledgment
thanks
for
the
warmth
and
commitment
he
thought
he
had
given
up
chasing
women
some
time
after
sally
and
before
ingrid
a
kind
woman
had
taken
him
in
hand
after
a
heartbreak
and
explained
joe
you
ca
earn
love
love
is
free
someone
loves
you
or
they
do
god
knows
why
she
had
been
so
sad
and
so
earnest
that
he
knew
it
was
true
shortly
thereafter
a
flashbulb
went
off
if
you
earn
love
then
if
someone
does
love
you
there
nothing
you
can
do
about
it
what
a
liberation
he
was
going
to
run
after
mo
a
relationship
might
be
around
the
corner
or
not
he
was
all
that
sure
he
wanted
one
anyway
call
her
in
a
couple
of
weeks
joe
was
going
to
run
out
of
money
in
less
than
a
year
he
began
reading
the
sunday
classifieds
an
experience
that
made
him
sweat
and
put
a
knot
in
his
stomach
on
a
monday
two
weeks
after
the
trip
to
kauai
he
followed
up
an
ad
for
a
programming
job
at
a
downtown
insurance
company
the
offices
were
bright
and
modern
the
staff
was
energetic
he
left
depressed
he
could
have
done
the
work
in
his
sleep
but
he
could
pretend
to
want
to
be
on
board
the
woman
who
interviewed
him
was
too
decent
joe
bring
himself
to
try
and
con
her
he
knew
that
if
he
were
hired
six
to
twelve
months
later
he
would
be
out
on
the
street
again
unable
to
keep
his
head
down
and
his
mouth
shut
the
next
morning
as
he
was
taking
a
shower
replaying
the
scene
at
the
insurance
company
he
bent
over
for
the
soap
something
split
in
his
back
it
was
like
being
hit
by
an
ax
he
managed
to
get
out
of
the
bathroom
and
lower
himself
to
the
floor
he
lay
still
for
half
an
hour
getting
his
breath
on
his
side
drawing
his
knees
up
he
pushed
himself
along
the
floor
a
few
inches
at
a
time
he
made
it
to
his
mattress
and
slid
under
the
comforter
changing
positions
was
painful
he
could
sleep
for
only
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
by
evening
he
was
too
thirsty
to
stay
where
he
was
he
pushed
himself
to
the
front
of
the
kitchen
sink
and
got
to
his
knees
gasping
holding
on
with
one
hand
he
reached
for
his
mug
with
the
other
and
filled
it
with
water
he
drank
and
then
refilled
it
and
placed
it
on
the
floor
he
opened
the
cabinet
under
the
sink
and
pulled
out
an
old
pie
plate
he
lowered
himself
to
the
floor
and
rested
before
he
pushed
himself
back
to
the
bed
dragging
along
the
water
and
the
pie
plate
he
was
able
to
pee
into
the
plate
while
he
lay
on
one
side
he
made
it
through
the
night
moving
as
little
as
possible
music
would
be
nice
he
thought
in
the
morning
forget
it
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
lie
still
and
not
panic
it
all
right
batman
he
called
to
the
lanai
he
thought
about
crawling
to
the
telephone
and
knocking
it
to
the
floor
with
the
broom
but
who
would
he
call
when
the
pie
plate
filled
he
inched
along
the
floor
dragging
it
into
the
bathroom
spilling
some
but
managing
to
reach
up
and
pour
most
of
it
into
the
toilet
he
shoved
himself
into
the
kitchen
for
more
water
holding
to
the
chair
by
the
table
he
was
able
to
reach
a
bunch
of
bananas
two
bananas
and
water
got
him
through
the
second
day
on
the
third
day
hanging
on
to
the
bedroom
door
frame
he
pulled
himself
slowly
to
his
feet
he
was
able
to
limp
to
the
bathroom
supporting
himself
with
the
sponge
mop
he
took
aspirin
and
shuffled
back
to
his
mattress
with
bread
and
a
piece
of
cheddar
cheese
he
ate
like
a
king
wishing
that
he
turned
on
the
radio
the
pain
was
less
intense
in
the
morning
aspirin
had
helped
him
sleep
for
four
or
five
hours
he
was
able
to
stand
up
slowly
turn
on
the
radio
and
reassure
batman
he
leaned
against
a
wall
and
stared
at
a
shaft
of
sunlight
falling
on
the
carpet
he
remained
there
motionless
without
words
pain
had
emptied
him
completely
the
disk
jockey
played
a
cyril
pahinui
cut
familiar
notes
cascaded
into
the
sunlight
ringing
and
humble
celebrating
and
accepting
the
only
life
we
know
it
all
right
joe
thought
as
his
isolation
broke
down
for
thine
is
the
kingdom
he
said
to
a
presence
in
the
sunshine
thankful
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
three
days
later
he
made
it
down
the
hill
to
the
store
and
back
he
exercised
regularly
and
began
to
feel
stronger
his
walks
were
longer
from
time
to
time
he
drank
too
much
but
he
was
generally
under
control
fortunately
he
had
a
little
time
before
he
ran
out
of
money
he
had
no
idea
what
to
do
but
he
knew
that
he
was
going
to
program
computers
for
an
insurance
company
the
back
pain
hell
was
a
clear
warning
not
to
repeat
his
old
patterns
in
the
past
he
would
drift
around
trying
to
write
things
run
out
of
money
and
then
abandon
the
writing
in
a
rush
to
join
a
work
group
pay
bills
and
pretend
he
was
like
the
others
in
the
group
it
never
worked
out
he
had
to
find
another
way
late
one
morning
he
was
at
the
wailana
coffee
shoppe
when
a
young
woman
sat
down
across
from
him
she
was
blonde
lightly
tanned
her
face
was
composed
nearly
immobilized
with
eye
shadow
liner
and
rich
red
lipstick
she
had
an
air
of
sadness
that
was
at
cross
purpose
to
her
youth
and
to
the
perfection
of
her
makeup
she
ate
breakfast
and
left
untroubled
by
joe
attention
for
the
thousandth
time
he
wished
he
could
draw
but
words
were
his
best
tools
it
was
more
than
the
woman
appearance
that
he
wanted
to
capture
he
wanted
to
know
how
he
felt
about
her
writing
was
a
way
of
finding
out
for
the
rest
of
the
day
as
he
walked
in
the
city
he
fiddled
with
words
starting
over
and
over
the
next
morning
he
returned
to
the
wailana
the
beauty
was
there
but
he
could
remember
her
well
enough
to
keep
writing
a
woman
sat
next
to
him
at
the
counter
he
paid
no
attention
until
she
asked
him
to
pass
the
ketchup
she
was
having
home
fries
with
her
eggs
nothing
like
home
fries
joe
said
stick
to
your
ribs
she
said
blushing
slightly
she
had
nice
ribs
large
breasts
pushed
against
a
white
blouse
doing
if
you
do
mind
my
asking
you
look
so
intense
i
was
trying
to
describe
someone
are
you
a
writer

joe
said

name
is
alison
alison
carl
have
you
been
here
long
in
hawaii
i

about
six
months
i
used
to
live
here
she
had
short
sandy
colored
hair
a
blunt
nose
and
a
wide
mouth
no
makeup
she
chewed
toast
with
a
satisfied
expression
i
doing
post
graduate
work
at
the
center
i
saw
the
dalai
lama
yesterday
joe
sat
straighter
no
kidding
what
was
he
like
cute
like
a
little
rock
she
was
compact
a
high
energy
type
what
your
name
joe
burke
he
took
evasive
action
alison
i
too
old
for
you
she
looked
downcast
for
a
moment
and
then
raised
her
eyebrows
hopefully
can
you
walk
i
can
there
she
said
winningly
taking
a
large
forkful
of
potatoes
what
you
mean
i
think
is
that
you
think
i
too
young
for
you
it
a
compliment
really
men
have
trouble
saying
what
they
think
sometimes
she
seemed
pleased
like
a
what
are
you
studying
joe
asked
buddhism
i
have
a
doctorate
in
comparative
religion
i
was
a
pastor
for
a
while
and
then
i
worked
at
a
seminary
i
was
canned
fired
yup
they
were
hypocrites
she
said
sadly
what
do
you
do
nothing
right
now
i
used
to
program
computers
design
software
when
i
lived
here
i
did
a
lot
of
stuff
drove
a
cab
delivered
newspapers
managed
a
tennis
club
i
ended
up
going
to
the
university
alison
sipped
coffee
let
get
this
over
with
she
said
i
how
old
are
you
joe
she
noted
his
surprise
with
equanimity
you
see
she
said
you
one
too
a
younger
than
you
looker
alison
he
said
more
firmly
it
has
been
nice
to
meet
you
but
i
must
be
going
much
to
do
goodbye
joe
thank
you
for
talking
to
me
he
did
want
to
wait
for
change
so
he
left
a
large
tip
and
walked
up
ala
moana
boulevard
relieved
but
with
the
odd
feeling
that
he
was
walking
toward
her
rather
than
away
at
that
afternoon
the
phone
rang
hi
joe
it
alison
i
was
bad
this
morning
i
sorry
i
do
know
what
got
into
me
what
do
you

you
were
busy
and
i
bothered
you
i
been
lonely
i
guess
i
realize
i
do
meet
people
like
you
very
often
that
was
flattering
joe
made
a
soothing
noise
how
about

joe
dutch
treat

was
surprised
uh
when
tonight
of
course
i
want
to
be
high
in
the

the
city
lights

ancient
old
days
i
will
wear
a
skirt

a
couple
of
hours
a
long
stretch
joe
said
but
then
he
felt
bad
why
not
they
agreed
to
meet
at
he
ironed
a
pair
of
pants
and
an
aloha
shirt
mumbling
to
himself
about
what
a
pain
in
the
ass
it
was
but
by
the
time
he
stepped
off
the
elevator
he
was
feeling
better
it
was
nice
to
be
liked
joe
was
overly
punctual
and
used
to
waiting
for
women
he
forgave
them
it
was
a
genetic
condition
associated
with
the
willingness
to
walk
slowly
in
front
of
onrushing
traffic
and
also
somehow
with
the
inability
to
have
money
ready
at
checkout
counters
alison
was
waiting
for
him
you
supposed
to
be
late
he
said
she
smiled
prettily
she
was
wearing
a
teal
colored
silk
tunic
over
a
chino
skirt
her
hair
was
brushed
back
a
small
opal
swung
from
each
ear
something
glittered
around
her
eyes
you
look
terrific
thank
you
they
sat
at
a
table
with
a
view
of
the
mountains
i
drink
much
she
said
as
he
ordered
a
glenlivet
and
water
i
do

single
malt

was
so
great
to
be
in
honolulu
where
we
know
anyone
my
feet
did
feel
the
pavement
for
a
year
but
we
had
a
hard
time
food
stamps
and
all
that
even
welfare
for
a
while
things
settled
down
when
i
started
driving
a
charley
cab
and
sally
cleaned
houses
cleaning
houses
is
bad
work
cash
anybody
gives
you
a
hard
time

just
go
somewhere
else
here
looking
at
you
they
touched
glasses
sally
had
a
couple
of
steady
gigs
where
she
liked
the
people
and
knew
what
she
was
supposed
to
do
every
week
his
mind
was
moving
back
some
amazing
things
did
happen
oh
good
alison
said
one
afternoon
i
went
over
to
kahala
to
pick
up
sally
at
a
cleaning
job
she
was
disturbed
sally
was
a
sweetheart
but
she
did
talk
much
after
six
years
of
marriage
i
knew
i
had
to
ask
if
i
wanted
to
know
what
was
going
on
she
described
a
scene
between
her
boss
heiress
to
the
cannon
towel
fortune
and
her
boss
daughter
the
daughter
told
her
mother
that
a
nice
man
had
come
into
her
room
during
the
night
had
sat
on
her
bed
and
talked
to
her
the
mother
explained
that
dreams
sometimes
seemed
real
the
daughter
said
that
it
was
a
dream
they
argued
there
were
tears
and
the
daughter
ran
upstairs
joe
paused
sally
thought
that
the
mother
had
handled
it
badly
what
did
you
think
alison
asked
what
did
i
know
anyway
time
flew
by

never
do
anything
but

a
tennis
club
on
the
other

i
walked
into

alison

was
trying
to
understand

whiskey
i
became

one
they
always
writing
about
in
the
paper
i
did
want
any
trouble
with
the
law
but

me
curiosity

out
several
nights
later
mike
and
i
were
seated
at
a
table
in
crazy
horse
a
topless
bar
that
catered
to
marines

was
short
and
stocky
intense
after
a
couple
of
beers
i
said

heard
you
were
the
cat
burglar
that
right
so
he
said

been
adopted
by
a
couple

relationship

worked

going
along
an
upstairs
hallway
and
i
looked
through
a
door
a
little
girl
was
sitting
up
in
bed
watching
me
i
did
want
to
scare
her
you
know
how
they
are
big
eyes
and
all
so
i
went
in
and
sat
on
her
bed
i
told
her
not
to
worry
i
was
just
doing
my
job
looking
for
things
at
night
i
told
her
that
her
job
was
to
get
a
good
sleep
have
good
dreams
and
be
ready
to
have
a
great
day
when
she
woke
up
she
settled
back
down
and
smiled
you
know
i
patted
the
bed
and
left
some
kind
of
bird
let
go
with
a
giant
scrawk
and
i
got
the
hell
out
of
there
down
over
the
lanai
in
back
not
going
to
believe
this
mike
i
said
i
told
him
about
the
six
foot
bird
cage
in
the
atrium
of
that
kahala
beach
house
and
the
little
girl
who
stuck
to
her
story
alison
bounced
in
her
chair
and
clapped
good
for
her
that
was
twenty
years
ago
joe
said
mike
got
caught
the
girl
probably
has
her
own
children
now
you
must
tell
her
alison
said
she
should
know
the
truth
is
important
alison
had
a
point
joe
had
felt
guilty
about
that
before
the
house
is
still
there
he
said
maybe
i
see
what
happened
to
them
if
they
moved
maybe
you
could
find
out
where
and
send
a
letter
aha
joe
said
as
dinner
arrived
he
had
gone
crazy
and
ordered
steak
alison
bent
over
her
scampi
and
inhaled
deeply
garlic
she
sighed
garlic
they
touched
glasses
again
dark
ruby
light
circled
and
glanced
through
his
cabernet
sauvignon
by
dessert
alison
had
told
him
that
she
was
from
a
small
town
near
madison
wisconsin
that
her
father
had
been
an
inventor
that
her
mother
was
still
alive
aging
and
in
need
of
care
my
father
was
hurt
in
an
accident
at
work
i
had
to
take
care
of
him
when
i
was
in
school
my
mother
always
had
other
jobs
he
was
strict
i
could
go
out
like
the
other
girls
i
was
taken
in
by
our
church
they
gave
me
a
scholarship
so
you
went
from
home
to
the
church
life
and
you
never
got
married
never
met
anyone
willing
joe
anyone
right
that
is
she
bent
over
the
table
and
lowered
her
voice
i
a
virgin
can
you
imagine
what
a
head
turned
in
their
direction
and
joe
lowered
his
voice
to
match
hers
how
on
earth
i
believe
in
the
sacrament
of
marriage
joe
technically
i
not
a
virgin
because
of
something
that
happened
a
long
time
ago
but
actually
i
am
one
he
blinked
several
times
as
she
continued
i
had
a
boyfriend
for
five
years
he
was
divorced
he
was
afraid
of
commitment
joe
joe
took
a
large
swallow
of
wine
we
used
to
fool
around
nothing
below
the
waist
she
added
gurmpph
he
cleared
his
throat
no
one
seemed
to
be
paying
any
attention
alison
was
still
leaning
forward
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
swelling
breast
and
the
curve
of
black
lace
that
rose
and
disappeared
behind
her
blouse
coffee
joe
said
we
must
have
coffee
it
had
grown
dark
gradually
and
alison
had
her
wish
to
look
at
city
lights
honolulu
lies
on
a
narrow
plain
between
the
mountains
and
the
pacific
sharp
ridges
descend
toward
the
water
the
ridge
faces
have
been
developed
at
night
they
are
like
jeweled
fingers
reaching
high
separated
by
vast
darknesses
beautiful
joe
swept
his
hand
toward
the
window
even
nicer
than
i
hoped
alison
said
i
did
mean
to
embarrass
you
joe
i
not
embarrassed
it
seems
like
a
waste
that
all
that
sweet
they
had
coffee
and
took
a
cab
to
her
apartment
not
far
from
the
university
was
it
so
bad
being
normal
she
asked
no
he
admitted
she
leaned
over
and
kissed
him
quickly
on
the
cheek
he
felt
like
uncle
thanked
for
a
birthday
present
there
she
said
and
got
out
night
joe
goodnight
alison
the
cab
driver
remained
silent
oh
yeah
joe
said
liholiho
street
the
young
beauty
with
the
makeup
was
not
at
the
wailana
the
next
morning
joe
ate
a
waffle
and
stared
across
the
counter
at
the
seat
where
she
had
been
as
he
reached
for
his
notebook
he
realized
why
she
was
sad
she
was
a
perfect
frozen
in
time
she
would
never
be
younger
more
beautiful
or
more
beautifully
made
up
to
answer
a
man
fantasy
and
it
was
enough
we
must
begin
again
he
said
to
himself
identifying
with
her
begin
again
without
shame
sometimes
you
have
to
start
over
even
go
backwards
in
order
to
go
forward
in
a
different
direction
he
wrote
the
words
down
and
nodded
it
was
a
poem
he
imagined
someone
reading
his
words
someone
he
did
know
it
was
a
good
feeling
lost
mail
that
what
a
poem
is
he
decided
he
made
up
his
mind
to
submit
it
to
the
university
literary
publication
he
had
tried
before
to
be
published
without
success
but
he
not
put
much
effort
into
it
written
for
himself
really
he
walked
home
prepared
the
lost
mail
and
left
a
message
for
mo
let
have
lunch
an
from
kate
was
waiting
for
him
dad
the
big
step
jackson
and
i

decided
to

island
to
be
a
central
gathering
place

of
the

have
anything

joe
reeled
around
the
apartment
and
then
back
congratulations
i
be
there
more
congratulations
love
dad
he
pulled
an
electric
broom
from
the
back
of
his
closet
and
began
pushing
it
back
and
forth
across
the
carpet
jackson
was
a
good
fellow
kate
was
happy
he
had
never
met
jackson
parents
he
was
going
to
have
to
be
respectable
where
was
san
juan
island
anyway
reservations
the
last
dust
crumb
had
disappeared
into
the
electric
broom
when
joe
stopped
pacing
he
put
the
vacuum
cleaner
away
and
decided
that
the
sensible
thing
to
do
was
to
take
a
walk
the
phone
rang
hi
joe
uh
hey
there
it
was
alison
i
enjoyed
dinner
last
night
so

said
but
i
got
a
lot
to
do
me

be
fun
joe
i
thinking
about
the
end
of
the

he
said
pushing
it
ahead

pick
you
up

get

your
place
he
gave
directions
and
then
suggested
that

instead
that
way
i
can
get
some
writing
done
early
and
it
wo
matter
if

kind
with
the
bumper
tires
lashed
around
if
they
have
them
she
said
see
you
saturday
joe
put
a
new
notebook
in
his
back
pocket
and
left
for
the
second
walk
of
the
day
he
found
the
san
juan
islands
in
an
atlas
at
the
main
library
they
were
small
off
the
northernmost
coast
of
washington
he
strolled
to
the
columbia
inn
and
ate
a
reuben
sandwich
it
would
be
good
to
see
everyone
and
to
meet
jackson
family
all
he
had
to
do
was
show
up
in
shape
and
not
drink
too
much
he
would
buy
an
outfit
that
could
travel
in
the
filson
bag
a
camera
the
edgewater
he
thought
stay
there
thursday
stay
on
the
island
friday
and
saturday
nights
and
then
go
back
to
the
edgewater
on
sunday
that
would
break
up
the
trip
he
made
a
list
and
then
he
began
to
write
about
mike
and
the
little
girl
the
message
light
was
blinking
when
he
got
home
joe
are
you
there
it
was
mo
no
i
afraid
lunch
will
have
to
wait
my
sister
has
talked
me
into
going
on
a
retreat
with
her
i
going
to
combine
the
trip
with
work
and
then
we
both
going
to
vermont
for
my
fiftieth
wedding
anniversary
i
wo
be
back
until
labor
day
she
paused
maybe
we
can
get
together
then
bye
damn
joe
had
been
hoping
that
she
would
be
a
buffer
against
alison
attention
he
made
tea
sat
at
the
computer
and
began
to
enter
the
cat
burglar
story
the
next
days
were
filled
with
writing
and
shopping
his
money
was
draining
away
but
kate
wedding
was
important
how
could
he
skimp
the
san
juan
islands
would
probably
be
cool
in
september
he
bought
a
silk
and
wool
blend
jacket
olive
gray
and
brown
in
a
quiet
weave
a
pair
of
lightweight
wool
pants
neutral
gray
green
a
silvery
tan
italian
dress
shirt
and
a
dark
brown
tie
complemented
the
jacket
he
bought
an
olympus
camera
that
had
a
sliding
lens
cover
and
would
fit
in
a
pocket
his
shoes
had
been
twice
and
were
ragged
he
bought
another
pair
the
same
style
trusty
clarks
the
outfit
was
expensive
but
he
wanted
to
dress
honestly
i
want
to
feel
like
myself
he
told
alison
on
saturday
i
sure
your
daughter
will
be
proud
of
you
alison
said
the
clothes
should
last
if
i
do
climb
a
tree
or
fall
into
a
vat
of
red
wine
they
were
headed
out
of
town
toward
nanakuli
it
was
raining
on
and
off
the
weather
was
likely
to
be
better
on
the
leeward
side
how
your
course
joe
asked
interesting
zen
is
so
different
in
its
practice
from
christianity
i
mean
it
makes
me
want
to
go
to
japan
and
visit
the
monasteries
find
a
teacher
you
need
a
teacher
to
learn
what
counts
to
become
one
yourself
alison
was
so
positive
that
joe
found
it
hard
to
imagine
her
having
had
job
troubles
why
did
you
get
fired
if
you
do
mind
my
asking
it
was
troubling
i
did
my
undergraduate
work
at
a
bible
college
but
i
well
educated
joe
i
have
a
masters
in
communication
from
columbia
and
a
phd
the
students
were
trained
to
go
out
and
do
the
lord
work
but
they
were
only
getting
one
point
of
view
in
their
education
the
books
in
the
curriculum
dealt
with
science
from
a
fundamentalist
point
of
view
presenting
arguments
as
though
they
were
objective
and
unbiased
the
students
graduated
thinking
that
they
were
educated
when
they
really
were
it
made
them
confident
and
more
able
to
face
the
work
but
i
did
like
it
the
lord
is
not
afraid
of
different
points
of
view
joe
joe
had
not
met
any
one
on
such
comfortable
terms
with
the
lord
she
was
absolutely
unaffected
it
funny
she
said
what
triggered
the
final
blow
up
was
an
editing
job
i
did
on
an
article
for
the
school
publication
the
writer
one
of
the
trustees
insisted
on
capitalizing
the
word
in
places
where
it
was
not
appropriate
good
heavens
joe
said
alison
giggled
really
in
the
light
of
eternity
what
difference
does
it
make
i
think
they
lost
a
good
person
joe
said
i
did
my
best
she
said
i
brought
lunch
great
they
drove
up
a
narrow
rocky
valley
and
ate
by
the
side
of
the
road
in
the
company
of
two
horses
alison
had
packed
a
bottle
of
wine
to
wash
down
sandwiches
of
red
peppers
goat
cheese
and
watercress
you
went
to
a
lot
of
trouble
joe
said
terrific
sandwiches
i
should
have
brought
glasses
for
the
wine
we
roughing
it
joe
said
pouring
more
into
his
paper
cup
i
wrote
the
cat
burglar
story
he
remembered
oh
good
yeah
i
took
it
to
the
house
in
kahala
an
old
guy
answered
the
door
and
told
me
that
the
family
had
sold
him
the
house
and
moved
to
california
he
was
nice
he
gave
me
their
address
so
i
sent
the
story
you
were
right
it
was
my
responsibility
it
felt
good
to
drop
the
letter
in
the
mail
hope
it
gets
to
her
alison
clapped
her
hands
the
horses
ears
picked
up
i
used
to
work
with
someone
who
lived
around
here
joe
said
the
horses
reminded
me
her
name
was
lovena
her
family
took
care
of
horses
where
did
you
work
in
a
warehouse
she
was
slim
like
a
boy
with
short
black
hair
and
brown
skin
she
was
strong
beautiful
really
i
was
falling
in
love
with
her
but
i
was
married
alison
sighed
lovena
was
great
very
shy
and
quiet
hard
working
sometimes
she
talked
to
me
when
the
orders
were
packed
and
shipped
she
talked
about
horses
and
barracuda
and
manta
rays
i
guess
there
one
time
of
year
when
mantas
come
into
shallow
water
to
mate
or
lay
eggs
or
something
people
can
step
on
them
by
accident
and
get
hurt
joe
paused
remembering
when
lovena
said
or
the
words
were
just
names
they
were
respectful
a
was
important
important
as
any
life
what
happened
to
her
do
know
i
quit
i
hated
to
say
goodbye
in
fact
the
last
day
there
i
asked
if
i
could
come
see
her
she
was
feeling
bad
too
she
looked
me
in
the
eye
and
said
and
you
bring
your
wife
and
that
pretty
little
girl
with
you
good
for
her
alison
said
mmm
it
looks
like
the
rain
might
be
stopping
let
find
a
beach
alison
suggested
yes
joe
corked
the
wine
and
called
to
the
horses
say
hi
to
lovena
for
me
will
you
alison
drove
out
to
the
highway
and
they
spent
the
afternoon
poking
around
reaching
the
end
of
the
road
and
turning
back
neither
was
in
a
hurry
to
return
to
the
city
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
were
standing
in
a
beach
park
as
the
sun
slipped
toward
the
horizon
i
think
a
front
just
went
through
joe
said
wow
a
dark
cloud
layer
caught
fire
lit
from
below
by
the
setting
sun
purple
and
crimson
flares
rolled
across
the
bottom
of
the
ragged
sky
two
hundred
yards
away
a
painted
flagpole
split
the
clouds
with
a
brilliant
white
line
it
was
like
a
crack
in
the
universe
a
glimpse
of
the
beyond
alison
moved
closer
and
they
stared
at
the
energy
that
seemed
to
pour
through
the
crack
too
much
joe
said
oh
joe
they
walked
to
the
rental
car
in
the
parking
lot
and
got
in
he
reached
for
her
it
was
spontaneous
and
all
wrong
alison
was
not
the
right
woman
they
hugged
their
bodies
twisting
awkwardly
in
the
small
seats
as
they
tried
to
get
closer
as
they
clung
to
each
other
ordinary
as
cloth
as
dogs
in
a
parking
lot
joe
was
unexpectedly
transported
with
relief
he
was
a
tiny
speck
in
a
universe
of
stars
and
specks
and
emptiness
nothing
kept
happening
to
him
like
a
tap
in
the
head
like
shells
falling
away
he
could
have
howled
with
laughter
or
cried
in
utter
gratitude
if
it
mattered
would
you
drive
alison
asked
sure
they
rode
in
silence
back
to
honolulu
joe
stopped
by
his
building
and
got
out
of
the
car
alison
opened
her
door
and
came
around
to
the
driver
side
joe
put
his
arms
around
her
and
she
settled
her
head
against
his
chest
they
stood
for
a
moment
bye
joe
said
she
turned
her
face
up
he
took
her
shoulders
in
his
hands
kissed
her
quietly
and
turned
away
bye
joe
he
waved
and
walked
slowly
inside
is
happening
here
but
you
do
know
what
it
is
do
you
the
dylan
line
echoed
in
his
mind
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
it
was
true
something
was
happening
it
did
feel
like
love
exactly
or
sex
exactly
he
was
still
shocked
by
the
freedom
and
relief
that
had
overwhelmed
him
in
the
parking
lot
three
days
later
alison
cooked
dinner
for
them
in
her
apartment
they
were
sitting
on
her
couch
when
joe
tried
to
describe
what
he
had
felt
during
their
hug
by
the
beach
sounds
like
what
the
zen
people
call
satori
she
said
i
do
know
he
said
i
think
i
been
messed
up
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
front
of
her
blouse
help
yourself
she
said
comfortably
he
undid
four
buttons
slid
down
on
the
couch
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
breast
his
mind
began
to
sign
off
as
her
nipple
responded
slow
spasms
moved
up
his
body
stopping
his
breath
and
tightening
his
stomach
muscles
alison
tuned
right
in
moving
with
him
sighing
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
lying
on
her
bed
marriage
considerations
and
the
rule
suspended
she
came
easily
and
gratefully
they
were
like
two
thirsty
people
sharing
a
glass
of
water
alison
got
up
some
time
later
joe
was
lying
with
his
eyes
closed
arms
outstretched
when
he
felt
a
washcloth
gently
but
firmly
applied
he
jumped
just
cleaning
up
she
said
cheerfully
go
back
to
sleep
joe
pictured
his
apartment
he
rolled
over
on
his
side
alison
he
said
yes
you
take
to
this
like
a
duck
to
water
it
must
be
the
swedish
she
said
seriously
alison
that
was
wonderful
but
i
have
to
go
home
oh
she
was
disappointed
are
you
sure
yes
joe
he
dressed
hugged
her
and
stepped
outside
widely
separated
streetlights
cast
circles
of
blue
light
hedges
and
trees
were
dark
green
in
the
shadows
he
was
only
forty
minutes
from
home
and
he
wanted
to
walk
in
the
cool
air
alison
was
going
to
make
up
for
lost
time
she
was
in
love
with
him
and
linking
fast
he
did
want
to
hurt
her
complications
he
told
batman
on
duty
at
his
post
on
the
lanai
nothing
we
ca
handle
but
he
was
so
sure
the
following
saturday
joe
was
on
alison
couch
again
her
need
to
be
coupled
was
stronger
than
his
need
to
be
alone
she
must
have
known
that
a
future
together
was
unlikely
but
she
did
care
she
was
in
love
joe
could
bring
himself
to
disappoint
her
besides
he
enjoyed
her
company
and
the
small
mole
below
her
left
ear
and
her
smell
which
reminded
him
of
a
field
after
rain
they
began
eating
dinner
together
every
other
night
but
joe
continued
to
go
home
afterwards
often
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
it
was
a
compromise
he
wanted
to
wake
up
in
his
own
bed
stick
to
his
habits
take
his
notebook
to
a
coffee
shop
and
keep
at
his
writing
the
weeks
sped
by
as
he
wrote
a
longer
story
based
on
mike
the
cat
burglar
it
was
not
successful
when
he
strayed
from
the
facts
as
he
remembered
them
he
felt
false
and
uncertain
he
had
the
uneasy
feeling
that
he
did
know
what
he
was
doing
one
afternoon
toward
the
end
of
august
he
and
alison
rode
the
nuuanu
bus
to
the
end
of
the
line
and
walked
to
the
bamboo
grove
that
mo
had
shown
him
they
stood
on
the
bridge
and
listened
to
the
rhythmic
hypnotic
knocking
it
so
romantic
joe
alison
leaned
against
him
yes
she
said
you
know
i
got
to
go
home
mmm
my
flight
is
wednesday
he
sighed
so
soon
are
you
going
to
stay
in
honolulu
joe
he
sensed
the
proposal
behind
the
question
it
was
tempting
to
follow
her
to
merge
lives
to
be
a
normal
husband
and
give
up
his
frustrating
search
for
something
he
did
understand
he
spoke
slowly
the
words
formed
themselves
for
the
time
being
he
said
this
damn
story
writing
is
any
good
you
must
give
up
she
looked
at
him
seriously
a
hint
of
tear
in
each
eye
i
ca
he
said
i
think
it
who
i
am
he
meant
i
not
going
to
come
with
you
and
be
your
man
oh
joe
her
tears
came
and
she
put
her
arms
around
him
they
held
each
other
as
the
bamboo
played
wo
you
be
lonely
yes
he
squeezed
her
i
miss
you
on
wednesday
a
version
of
poured
down
from
invisible
airport
speakers
joe
placed
a
pikake
and
ginger
lei
around
neck
i
love
that
song
he
said
pulling
away
even
muzak
ca
ruin
it
did
you
know
it
was
written
by
queen
liliuokalani
can
you
imagine
any
of
our
politicians
leaving
anything
as
good
joe
will
you
come
see
me
in
wisconsin
you
like
it
madison
is
very
cultural
alison
was
going
to
try
until
the
end
he
hesitated
she
bit
her
lower
lip
do
say
no
joe
just
do
say
no
he
hung
his
head
take
care
alison
it
had
been
a
good
time
sex
had
continued
between
them
as
straightforward
and
trusting
as
the
rest
of
their
relationship
but
alison
needed
to
be
in
wisconsin
taking
care
of
her
mother
and
she
needed
a
husband
not
his
part
time
attention
you
are
sorry
are
you
he
asked
oh
no
you
are
my
lover
man
and
she
smiled
because
it
was
a
joke
between
them
in
the
light
of
eternity
what
difference
does
it
make
she
threw
her
arms
around
him
then
turned
quickly
and
left
for
her
departure
gate
he
went
directly
to
the
moana
i
need
a
drink
gilbert
you
in
the
right
place
for
the
first
time
since
he
landed
in
hawaii
joe
was
lonely
alison
had
given
him
something
and
he
missed
it
already
what
was
it
her
directness
it
was
how
to
be
a
gift
he
watched
the
young
and
the
not
so
young
prowl
along
the
beach
bodies
glistening
with
tanning
oil
none
were
for
him
morgan
was
coming
through
for
a
night
he
remembered
and
mo
was
due
back
soon
he
could
talk
to
them
anyway
he
trudged
home
anesthetized
wished
batman
a
good
sleep
and
lowered
himself
onto
his
mattress
the
next
day
his
poem
was
returned
in
the
mail
rejected
without
comment
the
day
after
that
he
reached

on
the

to

in

morgan
with
a
new
haircut
looking
somewhat
larger
than

in
a
short

shirt
wearing
chinos
rather
than

striding
along
with
a
small
blonde
woman

to
the

of
the

went
over
to
the
international
marketplace
and
lost
himself
in
wandering
groups
of
tourists
a
balding
caricaturist
with
rimless
glasses
bantered
with
a
line
of
haoles
waiting
to

what

a
few
pen
strokes

a

around

untouched
on
the
tee
tennis
a
racquet
appeared
with
strings
burst
by
an
opponent
serve
two
or
three
minutes
and
he
was
done
asking
each
person
name
titling
the
drawing
beneath
its
head
signing
it
and
wrapping
it
in
clear
plastic
he
was
magician
and
entertainer
eyes
blue
and
shrewd
working
hard
keeping
the
crowd
alive
it
was
six
before
joe
realized

he

wearing
linen
slacks
and
an
open
weave
cotton
sweater
she
rarely
used
make
up
touches
of
eye
shadow
made
her
seem
especially
dressed
up
morgan
and
edie
walked
down
the
wide
back
steps
of
the
hotel
and
across
the
courtyard
beneath
the
banyan
tree
joe
waved
more
friends
he
said
they
moved
to
a
table
did
your
window
open
oh
yes
edie
said
nodding
it
was
very
satisfying
her
face
was
open
and
cheerful
her
eyebrows
curved
her
cheeks
curved
her
mouth
curved
widely
around
and
up
at
the
corners
beneath
the
curves
she
had
a
strong
head
so
morgan
waikiki
diamond
head
joe
stretched
out
his
arm
yes
morgan
said
in
his
most
approving
manner
what

you
do
here
edie
asked
mo
i
have
a
small
photography
business
how
wonderful
edie
said
i
am
one
corner
of
mouth
twitched
mo
sipped
her
lillet
me

joe
said
i
paid
cents
for
biology
drawings
in
high
school
my
worms

like
accordions
i
understand
you
are
a
builder
and
a
writer
mo
said
turning
to
morgan
i
suppose
so
he
said
damned
good
one
joe
said
what
is
your
book
about
houses
of
the
hudson
valley
mo
smiled
broadly
that
morgan
joe
thought
he
states
the
title
of
his
book
a
simple
fact
and
manages
to
imply
that
the
universe
is
a
lunatic
misunderstanding
that
we
are
all
waiting
at
the
wrong
bus
stop
have
you
been
working
on
it
long
mo
asked
nine
years
i
could
eat
a
edie
said
they
ended
up
at
the
restaurant
john
dominis
at
a
table
with
too
many
glasses
sea
bass
snapper
and
salads
desserts
no
one
wanted
to
stop
morgan
told
a
long
story
that
began
with
a
knock
on
his
door
one
winter
afternoon
a
jehovah
witness
had
wandered
up
the
mountain
to
proselytize
morgan
was
so
glad
to
see
someone
that
he
invited
him
in
and
had
a
conversation
about
the
bible
given
their
assumptions
morgan
said
i
thought
i
might
discuss
their
conclusions
the
following
week
the
witness
returned
with
help
pots
of
tea
hours
later
the
witness
and
his
help
left
baffled
promising
to
return
with
an
elder
by
spring
much
of
the
energy
was
directed
at
rebutting
the
doctrinal
challenge
from
the
mountains
morgan
was
invited
to
headquarters
where
an
informal
truce
was
reached
they
are
an
efficient
organization
in
many
ways
morgan
said
grandly
poor
bastards
joe
said
morgan
is
difficult
in
debate
mo
he
got
out
of
the
draft
by
writing
so
many
complicated
letters
questioning
selective
service
procedures
that
they
finally
figured
it
would
be
easier
to
classify
him
a
successful
campaign
morgan
said
better
than
mine
joe
said
could
have
been
worse
morgan
reminded
him
true
joe
explained
to
edie
and
mo
that
he
enlisted
in
the
air
force
and
decided
midway
through
his
hitch
that
war
was
wrong
that
people
should
kill
each
other
vietnam
was
heating
up
the
colonel
at
my
listened
to
my
speech
smiled
at
two
lieutenants
who
were
doing
legal
training
and
said
burke
you
may
persist
in
your
attitude
and
i
will
sentence
you
to
one
year
at
fort
leavenworth
federal
penitentiary
and
a
bad
conduct
discharge
or
you
can
keep
your
mouth
shut
serve
the
rest
of
your
enlistment
and
i
will
sentence
you
to
thirty
days
in
the
stockade
a
five
hundred
dollar
fine

gavel
the
son
of
a
bitch
i
was
twenty
i
was
stubborn
i
had
no
idea
what
a
federal
pen
was
like
i
opened
my
mouth
for
another
statement
of
principle
and
a
voice
sounded
in
my
head
only
happened
to
me
twice
it
said
asshole
people
kill
each
other
they
have
always
killed
each
other
what
do
you
think
doing
the
voice
saved
me
days
i
said
the
colonel
smacked
his
gavel
and
read
the
sentence
for
the
record
sir
i
said

the
bx

just
park
it
behind
the
barracks
two
ap
took
me
by
the
elbows
and
marched
me
to
the
stockade
a
near
thing
edie
said
it
was
a
senseless
war

joe
said
and
it
was
the
poor
boys
from
kentucky
who
died
in
it
and
the
vietnamese
mo
added
they
were
silent
it
was
so
bad
in
the
stockade
joe
said
we
got
to
watch
tv
for
an
hour
each
afternoon
perry
mason
the
guys
were
always
yelling
for
longer
sentences

she
used
to
give
him
a
hard
time
at
the
commissary
he
called
her
a
bitch
one
afternoon
and
she
complained
to
her
husband
ninety
days
they
add
it
to

of
your
hitch

so
you
had
to
serve
thirty
extra
days

i
got
five
days
off
for
good
behavior
it
cooled
me
down
i
got
through
the
rest
of
my
hitch
without
any
problems
they
settled
the
bill
joe
put
half
on
his
credit
card
and
morgan
asked
what
he
was
doing
for
money
nothing
joe
said
you
ca
spend
more
than
you
earn
forever

good
point

not
quite
broke

learning
languages
it
was
something
i
did
just
to
get
by
given
it
up
oh
good
she
said
he
drew
them
a
map
of
lihue
showing
the
way
to
hamura
saimin
miss
it
they
made
their
way
back
to
the
moana
and
said
goodbye
mo
dropped
joe
off
at
liholiho
street
just
before
they
parted
he
thought
he
saw
her
hesitate
he
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
that
she
was
naked
turning
away
from
him
in
bed
to
another
man
he
touched
the
base
of
her
back
where
it
curved
toward
him
and
rubbed
a
few
small
farewell
circles
morgan
was
right
of
course
sooner
or
later
he
was
going
to
run
out
of
money
things
were
going
well
he
was
satisfied
with
the
cat
burglar
story
and
he
was
lonely
he
decided
to
write
a
story
about
alphonse
and
the
cannery
alphonse
was
a
slim
dark
middle
aged
filipino
with
a
thin
straight
mustache
he
had
watched
joe
stack
empty
pallets
with
a
yellow
hyster
and
then
he
motioned
joe
out
of
the
seat
the
forklift
engine
roared
his
hands
blurred
pallets
leaped
into
perfect
piles
ten
feet
high
alphonse
cut
the
engine
and
climbed
down
eyes
bright
he
was
somewhere
between
ten
and
a
hundred
times
faster
than
joe
the
cannery
whistle
blew
coffee
break
alphonse
smiled
nodded
and
turned
for
the
cafeteria
joe
followed
alphonse
was
joe
trainer
wherever
they
went
in
the
cannery
people
called
to
him
he
lifted
a
hand
smiled
and
kept
going
he
was
universally
popular
but
he
rarely
spoke
to
anyone
he
focused
on
the
work
how
to
do
it
better
how
to
do
it
faster
joe
was
in
a
welfare
job
training
program
he
hated
the
whistle
that
told
them
when
they
could
stop
and
when
they
must
start
he
hated
the
gray
industrial
paint
and
the
numbing
future
less
work
for
someone
else
profit
alphonse
had
no
future
not
only
that
he
was
twenty
years
older
than
joe
he
worked
joe
into
the
ground
every
day
and
when
he
waved
with
a
small
smile
and
walked
away
at
the
end
of
the
shift
his
head
was
high
and
he
seemed
untouched
alphonse
had
his
own
standards
his
own
integrity
and
somehow
he
was
stronger
than
the
whole
gray
clanking
cannery
stronger
than
profit
stronger
than
loss
joe
wrote
but
the
story
was
any
good
it
was
true
as
far
as
it
went
but
it
was
a
story
what
is
a
story
anyway
joe
realized
that
he
did
know
when
maxie
was
about
fifteen
joe
used
to
quiz
him
on
joe
maxims
joe
women
maxie
uh
women
women
all
women
are
pear
shaped
joe
handing
maxie
a
quarter
very
good
very
good
and
now
for
a
dollar
grand
prize
an
educated
man
maxie
damn
an
educated
man
umm
knows
what
he
does
know
joe
right
joe
position
was
that
educated
people
know
at
least
one
subject
well
enough
so
that
they
realize
by
comparison
when
they
do
know
another
this
was
heavy
for
fifteen
but
max
was
game
the
idea
is
to
know
when
you
do
know
what
you
doing
then
you
can
go
ask
someone
or
buy
a
good
book
and
find
out
joe
explained
maxie
nodded
agreement
winnings
crumpled
firmly
in
one
hand
so
go
find
out
what
a
story
is
joe
told
himself
he
began
reading
books
on
fiction
but
they
were
much
help
for
a
change
of
pace
he
looked
up
arthur
soule
on
the
internet
and
discovered
that
a
book
written
on
roman
taxation
was
still
available
joe
ordered
it
and
when
it
arrived
he
found
it
interesting
and
clearly
written
there
was
a
small
picture
of
soule
on
the
book
jacket
patrician
with
a
large
jaw
and
thinning
hair
mo
was
a
chip
off
the
old
block
a
few
days
before
kate
wedding
the
phone
rang
as
he
was
heading
out
the
door
hi
joe
mornin
mo
that
a
snappy
opening
he
said
maybe
we
should
have
a
radio
program
but
it
would
have
to
be
in
the
morning
she
said
when
i
work
me
too
good
point
that
settled
no
show
i
was
wondering
if
you
might
want
to
come
over
for
lunch
sure
i
have
an
ulterior
motive
two
actually
leaky
faucets
say
no
more
i
was
born
to
plumb
see
you
around
noon
then
yup
wait
a
minute
where
she
gave
him
directions
to
a
small
street
on
the
ewa
side
of
manoa
valley
no
problem
he
said
putting
the
phone
down
trouble
in
gotham
batman
lady
needs
help
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
this
was
a
test
no
doubt
about
it
a
dragon
to
slay
he
had
left
his
slayer
pliers
in
his
truck
however
along
with
the
rest
of
his
tools
they
now
belonged
to
maxie
and
were
somewhere
in
new
england
he
walked
to
the
shopping
center
and
bought
a
toolkit
cased
in
aluminum
with
foam
cut
out
for
each
individual
tool
it
looked
like
a
briefcase
he
went
to
sears
for
a
package
of
faucet
washers
and
some
thread
sealer
joe
burke
executive
plumber
he
announced
at
mo
door
well
come
right
in
she
looked
rested
he
took
off
his
shoes
and
advanced
into
a
clean
living
room
furnished
with
a
long
couch
an
armchair
a
wooden
rocking
chair
a
gray
rug
several
expensively
framed
photographs
and
two
floor
lamps
orchids
hung
by
a
large
window
lush
greenery
rose
steeply
behind
the
house
nice
mighty
nice
the
house
was
small
built
above
and
behind
a
separate
garage
that
fronted
the
street
steps
led
up
to
a
porch
and
the
door
through
which
he
entered
the
air
was
cool
and
quiet
the
house
seemed
to
breathe
in
a
wooded
space
just
large
enough
for
it
and
for
the
walls
of
vegetation
on
either
side
that
separated
it
from
its
neighbors
a
sense
of
privacy
lay
in
the
living
room
like
an
expensive
gift
mo
led
him
into
a
neatly
organized
kitchen
i
know
who
he
is
joe
pointed
at
a
photograph
of
her
father
that
hung
above
a
table
ah
yes
my
father
do
i
look
so
much
like
him
very
similar
in
the
eyes
and
mouth
what
else
was
there
professor
soule
she
said
i
read
his
book
joe
confessed
pretty
good
writer
an
expression
both
arrogant
and
helpless
flashed
across
her
face
clear
joe
added
yes
he
a
worker
her
expression
neutralized
joe
put
a
hand
behind
his
ear
i
do
hear
any
dripping
let
me
show
you
the
kitchen
does
drip
all
the
time
the
bathroom
is
the
worst
joe
leaned
over
the
bathroom
sink
thumped
it
and
listened
to
its
heartbeat
operation
iss
required
he
opened
the
aluminum
case
snazzo
so
shiny
she
said
staring
at
the
tools
i
fix
the
salad
joe
shut
the
water
off
and
began
dismantling
a
faucet
eventually
reaching
the
washer
held
by
a
brass
screw
he
replaced
both
washers
in
the
bathroom
and
both
in
the
kitchen
as
new
he
said
washing
his
hands
wonderful
she
carried
a
dark
salad
bowl
one
step
down
into
a
dining
room
that
had
a
tile
floor
and
large
windows
i
eat
in
the
kitchen
usually
but
when
i
have
company
it
nice
to
be
out
here
should
we
have
more
light
it
sprinkling
again
she
switched
on
a
paper
globe
suspended
over
the
table
i
do
know
i
like
the
natural
light
she
switched
it
off
and
lit
a
sage
colored
candle
there
that
better
we
had
this
end
of
the
porch
extended
and
made
into
a
dining
room
when
it
clear
you
can
see
across
the
valley
who
we
it
was
thurston
really
it
was
thurston
house
we
lived
together
for
eight
years
he
ran
off
with
his
secretary
to
texas
oh
ran
is
the
right
word
thurston
did
run
anywhere
he
was
rather
deliberate
actually
he
gave
me
a
deal
on
the
house
that
was
good
joe
said
i
did
want
him
to
go
men
just
ca
keep
their
thing
in
their
pants
she
said
angrily
joe
remembered
that
silence
was
golden
mo
reached
for
a
baguette
of
french
bread
and
broke
it
sharply
joe
took
a
piece
and
investigated
the
cheese
chevre
yes
finest
kind
yummy
salad
fresh
olive
oil
manoa
lettuce
avocado
scallions
a
hint
of
lime
or
maybe
meyer
lemon
delicious
with
the
crusty
bread
vino
she
nodded
and
he
poured
them
each
a
glass
of
sauvignon
blanc
from
a
half
empty
bottle
here
to
your
cozy
place
he
toasted
mo
raised
her
glass
and
sipped
i
had
fun
last
week
with
your
friends
she
said
quite
a
character
that
morgan
i
had
a
card
from
them
in
kauai
they
found
hamura
mo
listened
as
she
chewed
salad
yeah
we
go
way
back
joe
said
what
did
you
think
of
edie
dynamite
mo
said
she
got
me
thinking
about
writing
a
story
i
tried
but
i
not
satisfied
he
told
mo
about
alphonse
i
been
reading
about
fiction
i
not
really
getting
it
schools
can
be
useful
she
suggested
sometimes
it
good
to
be
around
others
doing
the
same
kind
of
work
i
like
to
go
to
a
seminar
once
in
a
while
the
trouble
is
it
costs
so
much
have
you
heard
of
goddard
in
vermont
i
have
they
offer
mfa
programs
or
close
to
it
it
an
idea
i
think
about
it
time
slipped
by
mo
told
stories
about
summers
on
nantucket
where
her
grandmother
had
a
twelve
room
cottage
on
the
water
so
that
where
she
developed
her
beach
strut
joe
thought
mo
father
had
slyly
dominated
the
family
even
though
her
mother
had
all
the
money
mo
was
ambivalent
toward
her
father
she
was
proud
of
his
intellect
and
accomplishments
but
she
had
an
inside
view
of
what
he
had
taken
from
every
one
around
him
and
the
price
he
himself
had
paid
for
academic
success
she
was
looking
for
a
way
to
be
like
him
without
being
like
him
joe
decided
mo
tried
her
new
espresso
machine
she
was
having
dinner
guests
the
following
evening
joe
visited
the
bathroom
and
noticed
that
she
had
left
open
the
door
to
her
bedroom
the
bed
was
freshly
made
with
lilac
purple
sheets
a
huge
white
flower
by
georgia
waited
on
the
wall
he
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
listen
to
music
but
he
did
say
anything
he
was
tuning
into
mo
way
of
inhabiting
her
space
her
large
eyes
quiet
he
talked
about
kate
and
max
and
then
fell
silent
so
how
your
love
life
she
asked
suddenly
her
eyebrows
were
raised
she
bent
forward
making
herself
smaller
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
i
had
a
home
you
a
good
looking
man
joe
burke
just
the
right
amount
of
gray
in
your
mustache
aristocrat
rebel
how
did
your
nose
get
that
crook
in
it
by
the
way
i
been
meaning
to
ask
oh
that
joe
said
the
rebounding
wars
in
high
school
she
had
surprised
him
he
thought
she
was
moving
away
from
him
and
now
he
sensed
the
outlines
of
an
offer
the
second
one
in
two
months
he
and
mo
could
be
lovers
he
would
ride
shotgun
do
things
her
way
and
she
would
do
her
best
for
him
in
time
left
over
from
her
busy
life
the
lilac
sheets
beckoned
but
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
the
offer
if
it
had
been
one
was
gone
swept
off
the
table
with
the
crumbs
she
brushed
with
one
hand
into
the
other
she
stood
and
said
the
ladies
better
watch
it
i
still
have
work
to
do
today
i
got
some
orders
i
trying
to
get
out
by
the
weekend
again
he
was
surprised
but
he
went
on
as
though
nothing
had
happened
she
drove
him
home
his
tool
case
on
his
lap
i
call
you
when
i
get
back
from
the
wedding
he
said
with
his
hand
on
her
car
door
have
fun
she
said
and
pulled
away
with
a
thoughtful
frown
joe
walked
up
the
stairs
to
his
apartment
what
did
she
want
what
did
he
want
he
did
know
he
had
to
admit
probably
that
was
why
the
offer
vanished
he
paid
attention
to
the
plumbing
and
flunked
passion
joe
slung
the
aluminum
case
across
the
room
onto
the
mattress
the
tools
in
their
foam
cushion
did
even
rattle
i
kept
my
goddamned
thing
in
my
goddamned
pants
batman
batman
maintained
a
dignified
silence
the
next
day
joe
went
to
a
bookstore
and
wrote
down
the
addresses
of
several
graduate
schools
that
offered
programs
at
home
he
hunted
around
on
the
internet
and
found
a
writers
group
that
discussed
the
pros
and
cons
of
different
programs
montpelier
also
in
vermont
was
well
regarded
he
polished
up
his
wrote
a
long
letter
explaining
why
an
programmer
wanted
to
write
fiction
signed
a
check
threw
in
some
poems
for
good
measure
and
officially
applied
to
montpelier
he
walked
to
the
moana
and
watched
the
sunset
it
had
been
a
year
since
he
arrived
in
hawaii
had
he
really
left
maine
or
was
this
just
an
extended
visit
that
was
coming
to
an
end
joe
liked
maine
portland
was
a
comfortable
little
city
the
standard
bakery
fresh
ale
at
gritty
lattes
at
a
dozen
different
coffee
shops
he
remembered
the
small
man
who
pushed
a
shopping
cart
down
the
street
in
all
seasons
accepting
joe
returnable
bottles
with
a
grateful
smile
always
saluting
as
though
joe
were
a
superior
should
he
go
back
to
maine
or
to
woodstock
he
had
many
old
friends
in
woodstock
daisy
morgan
had
passed
along
her
best
wishes
joe
looked
down
the
beach
at
the
lights
circling
the
base
of
diamond
head
did
he
want
to
go
back
east
it
felt
better
to
sit
under
the
banyan
tree
and
watch
it
get
dark
it
seemed
a
more
forward
direction
whatever
happened
he
decided
to
say
goodbye
to
maine
and
to
woodstock
but
he
could
no
wonder
we
say
see
you
he
thought
anything
but
goodbye
aloha
is
a
much
better
word
hello
and
goodbye
gladness
and
grief
love
all
of
it
the

joe
walked
to
the
elliot
bay
book
company
and
asked
a
woman
at
the
cash
register
if
he
could
buy
a
gift
certificate
for
a
wedding
present
he
added
we
can
do
that
how
much
for
a
thousand
dollars
this
would
leave
him
seriously
low
but
to
hell
with
it
she
struggled
with
the
computer
i
lied

ca

that
the
computer

for
jackson
umm

jackson

he
would
explain
that
he
was
trying
to
tell
them
how
to
split
it
he
walked
back
to
the
hotel
and
began
writing
a
story
in
the
bar
where
he
had
watched
fanatuua
earn
his
money
across
the
room
a
sturdy
woman
seated
in
a
wheelchair
studied
him
through
thick
glasses
two
hours
flew
by
like
minutes
she
was
gone
when
he
got
up
from
the
table
in
the
morning
he
put
on
jeans
and
his
best
aloha
shirt
walked
to
the
pier
next
to
the
hotel
and
boarded
the
victoria
clipper

and
nearly
to
vancouver
island
in
canada
the
catamaran
hummed
along
while
passengers
sunned
themselves
took
pictures
and
moved
about
the
cabins
the
captain
announced
the
islands
as
washington
banana
belt
free

the
rain

friday

checked
in
at
the
friday

inn
where
kate
had
made
reservations
the
house

had
rented

in

a
few
miles
from

down
toward
the
ferry
to
look
for
a
cab
and
was
hailed
from
across
the
street
it
was
max

decided
to
have
an
ale
in
a
brew
pub
on
the

but
in
max

he
lapsed
into
old
habits
the

he
might
have
been
just
away

a
business
trip

joe
a
photograph
of

at
the
base
of
a
mountain

near
londonderry
in
vermont
eight
acres
at
the
far
corner
of
this
farm
he
pointed
with
his
finger
just
at
the
end
of
this
highest
field
a
piece
that
runs
up
the
hill
one
of
my

a
tent
platform
and

handed
joe
another
picture
at
the
top
of
a
clearing
a
long
log
projected
out
from
under
a
ledge
it
was
supported
by
two
shorter
logs
lashed
together
in
an
x
standing
upright
on
the
end
of
the
log
was
a
prehistoric
figure
with
straight
arms
and
large
rocks
for
hands
the
hands
extended
out
and
below
its
feet
stone
man

narrow
head

piece
of
slate
i
split
the
end
of
the
log

his
head
part
way
down
the
split
and
lashed
it
like

tomahawk

through
open
country
and
along
a
dirt
road
to
a
house
at
the
top
of
a
heathery
field
that
sloped
broadly
down
to
the
water
hedges
enclosed
a
back
lawn
where
a
long
table
was
covered
with
a
white
cloth
several
chairs
were
positioned
on
the
grass
by
an
aluminum
keg
kate
was
in
the
kitchen
preparing
the
buffet
directing
a
small
army
of
friends
dad

a
hug
nice

introduced
him
to

monica
names
blurred

a
great
event
kate
he
cut
a
piece
of
cheddar
and
broke
off
the
end
of
a
loaf
of
french
bread
he
pointed
at
a
quart
mason
jar
this
pear
and
ginger
chutney
yumm
he
walked
out
on
the
front
porch
jackson
was
throwing
a
frisbee
to
a
border
collie
honey
colored
white
at
the
throat
scrambling
and
leaping
against
a
background
of
blue
gray
water
boats
and
a
distant
wooded
shore
joe
could
remember
nothing
in
his
life
as
assured
and
as
photogenic
he
was
happy
for
kate
and
jackson
this
weekend
was
a
parent
reward
he
accepted
it
gratefully
yet
it
was
hard
to
relax
he
had
social
duties
and
besides
he
was
increasingly
something
other
or
more
than
a
parent
jackson
rubbed
the
dog
head
and
threw
the
frisbee
as
far
as
he
could
he
came
over
and
shook
hands
congratulations

stout
man
waiting
at

to
sally
she

rangy
and
athletic
gino
came
only
to
her
ear
but
he
was
solidly
built
and
did
not
seem
smaller
his
eyes
were
dark
and
rather
impenetrable
going
for
seven
sally
said

one
of
your

max
was
standing
in
front
of
an
oil
painting
at
the
far
end
of
the
living
room
gino
and
joe
went
over
for
sure
joe
said
he
had
seen
it
before
wedding
present
kate
called
from
the
kitchen
we
brought
it
over
to
make
the
house
seem
more
like
home
it
was
a
deer
isle
scene
an
apple
tree
in
full
bloom
crowded
by
woods
behind
it
leaned
over
the
edge
of
a
field
and
a
stock
car
that
was
missing
its
hood
and
engine
the
wheels
were
twisted
strangely
in
the
grass
a
large
yellow
was
painted
on
a
blue
door
white
blossoms
lay
scattered
on
the
wreck
day
is
the
name
of
the
painting
kate
said
coming

good
max
said
i
think
he
getting
better
joe
said
is
he
coming
kate
by
the
way
no
he
said
he
wanted
to
but
he
was
feeling
up
to
the
trip
very
artistic
gino
said
and
this
too
he
held
up
a
knight
from
jackson
chess
set
which
was
laid
out
on
a
table
beneath
the
painting
he
spun
the
piece
slowly
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
jackson
made
those
joe
said
very
nice
do
you
play
chess
joe
yes
but
how
about
a
game
joe
did
want
to
play
he
had
been
too
well
taught
and
he
wanted
to
drink
and
drift
around
on
the
porch
yes
gino
picked
up
the
board
and
carried
it
to
an
outside
table
joe
followed
reluctantly
wine
joe
wine
for
chess
the
merlot
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
cheerfully
joe
gave
up
and
fetched
a
bottle
and
two
glasses
from
the
kitchen
corkscrew
joe
said
to
himself
but
before
he
could
move
gino
held
up
an
elegantly
curved
pocket
knife
and
corkscrew
he
had
the
cork
out
by
the
time
joe
sat
down
families
he
toasted
joe
nodded
the
wine
was
soft
and
bursting
with
flavor
oh
boy
joe
said
a
small
estate
a
good
year
gino
said
he
held
out
his
fists
a
pawn
hidden
in
each
joe
pointed
received
white
and
opened
pawn
to
four
gino
took
a
sip
of
wine
and
began
a
sicilian
defense
monica
or
jesse
was
taking
her
turn
throwing
the
frisbee
for
the
dog
about
ten
moves
into
a
slowly
developing
game
gino
reached
forward
drove
his
bishop
through
joe
position
and
leaned
back
joe
was
shocked
he
did
want
to
look
at
gino
he
did
need
to
the
real
man
was
on
the
board
he
cleared
his
throat
and
breathed
deeply
gino
had
taken
his
knight
it
was
a
forced
exchange
he
had
no
choice
but
to
take
bishop
and
wreck
his
own
defense
gino
gathered
for
attack
and
joe
went
into
full
retreat
playing
for
time
hoping
for
a
mistake
twenty
moves
later
he
conceded
ah
nice
game
joe
gino
tossed
off
the
rest
of
his
wine
we
must
have
another
joe
said
after
i
have
a
brain
transplant
and
read
a
few
books
ha
ha
very
artistic
gino
repeated
holding
up
a
bishop
joe
retreated
to
the
kitchen
for
a
piece
of
bread
jesus
christ
he
said
to
sally
in
a
low
voice
you
lasted
longer
than
most
she
said
i
thought
i
saw
him
think
a
couple
of
times
rolf
appeared
and
clunked
a
jar
down
on
the
counter
capers
he
said
what
for
crab
cakes
kate
said
more
people
arrived
kate
friends
continued
to
pile
food
and
dishes
on
the
table
in
the
back
yard
one
couple
brought
an
enormous
smoked
salmon
jackson
parents
showed
up
joe
was
happy
to
see
two
more
people
over
fifty
hi
i
joe
father
of
the
bride
he
said
extending
his
hand
i
gunnar
this
is
bonnie
gunnar
arendal
was
wide
shouldered
a
few
inches
shorter
than
joe
he
had
a
high
forehead
blue
eyes
a
strong
nose
and
a
trim
blonde
mustache
his
hair
was
swept
back
gray
at
the
temples
bonnie
was
spare
compact
and
deeply
tanned
her
hair
was
dark
and
short
fine
lines
crisscrossed
her
face
a
handsome
builder
and
a
power
elf
jackson
tells
me
you
a
builder
down
in
the
bay
area
yes
i
did
a
little
of
that
when
i
was
a
kid
i
could
pick
up
a
bundle
of
shingles
now
they
are
getting
any
lighter
gunnar
said
mildly
what
do
you
do
bonnie
asked
used
to
program
computers
gave
it
up
now
i
learning
how
to
write
oh
what
kind
of
writing
stories
bonnie
could
live
without
her
mysteries
gunnar
said
it
true
she
said
hi
dad
mom
you
met
joe
jackson
put
an
arm
around
each
of
them
hello
dear
bonnie
said
the
food
is
mostly
out
jackson
said
beer
wine
hard
stuff
help
yourselves
joe
could
see
where
jackson
got
his
energy
and
talent
people
make
more
sense
when
you
met
their
parents
jackson
and
kate
would
have
problems
joe
thought
who
does
but
they
were
a
good
match
and
off
to
a
fine
start
what
more
could
a
parent
ask
he
staked
out
a
position
by
the
keg
and
had
a
sociable
time
he
kept
expecting
to
see
ingrid
but
she
did
appear
finally
a
couple
of
hours
after
dark
he
hitched
a
ride
into
town
and
went
to
bed
he
slept
restlessly
and
dreamed
that
a
group
of
beautiful
young
people
were
enjoying
themselves
on
a
lawn
he
was
watching
through
thick
glass
he
could
hear
them
joe
slept
late
at
the
friday
harbor
inn
he
walked
down
the
hill
and
ate
pancakes
in
the
midst
of
an
argument
about
a
town
construction
project
money
politics
it
was
comfortably
familiar
he
went
back
to
bed
and
did
wake
up
until
noon
his
new
clothes
had
survived
nicely
folded
at
the
bottom
of
the
filson
bag
the
shirt
was
in
its
original
box
he
removed
the
pins
dressed
and
tied
his
tie
several
times
before
he
got
it
right
he
took
a
bus
to
the
county
park
the
bus
sped
through
shady
woods
up
and
down
hills
and
past
horses
grazing
in
uneven
fields
it
stopped
at
a
resort
by
a
narrow
harbor
choked
with
pleasure
boats
three
women
boarded
as
the
bus
left
the
harbor
they
told
the
driver
about
a
tourist
who
had
died
of
a
heart
attack
pedaling
his
bicycle
up
that
very
hill
an
hour
earlier
he
was
in
his
fifties
one
said
too
soon
another
said
cheerfully
grover
and
henry
are
playing
golf
but
they
walking
said
the
third
the
driver
stopped
at
the
turnoff
to
the
park
joe
skipped
out
gratefully
the
grim
reaper
was
sure
to
stay
with
the
interested
audience
there
was
a
parking
lot
and
a
grassy
area
by
the
water
jackson
and
several
friends
were
carrying
folding
tables
and
chairs
up
a
rocky
path
joe
took
two
chairs
and
followed
them
to
a
clearing
on
a
bluff
above
the
water
chairs
were
arranged
in
the
traditional
bride
and
groom
groups
a
center
aisle
leading
towards
the
edge
of
the
bluff
rows
of
champagne
glasses
covered
most
of
a
table
set
up
beside
the
chairs
coolers
waited
auspiciously
on
the
ground
behind
the
tables
you
guys
have
thought
of
everything
joe
said
to
jackson
kate
could
run
nato
he
said
probably
run
it
better
joe
said
gorgeous
view
we
were
camping
out
here
last
year
and
we
thought
it
would
be
the
perfect
place
to
get
married
they
returned
for
the
last
of
the
chairs
a
musician
arrived
carrying
a
guitar
case
and
a
battery
powered
amp
he
unpacked
and
began
plunking
away
at
bach
and
vivaldi
a
minister
with
a
neatly
trimmed
beard
stood
by
a
large
madrone
oak
he
was
well
dressed
quiet
and
to
the
point
of
disappearance
joe
who
was
finding
himself
increasingly
fond
of
people
over
fifty
engaged
him
in
conversation
he
looked
as
though
he
been
created
whole
that
morning
in
the
image
of
the
northwest
but
he
admitted
to
being
from
vermont
that
was
as
far
as
joe
could
get
the
minister
evaded
all
questions
about
his
youth
as
though
he
had
left
a
bad
record
behind
or
maybe
just
an
uncouth
one
hi
stranger
joe
turned
to
the
familiar
voice
ingrid
he
said
opening
his
arms
she
advanced
and
held
him
tightly
for
a
moment
before
backing
away
with
a
satisfied
smile
you
are
looking
well
joe
said
and
do
tell
me
it
because
of
your
happy
sex
life
it
the
mediterranean
diet
olive
oil
he
said
ingrid
had
lost
a
few
pounds
although
she
need
to
her
thick
blonde
hair
was
cut
short
and
away
from
her
even
features
her
expression
was
practical
and
dominated
by
eyes
the
color
of
transparent
jade
you
do
look
so
bad
yourself
she
said
ah
well
more
serious
she
said
more
gray
in
your
mustache
thinner
time
getting
shorter
tell
me
about
it
i
so
happy
for
kate
yes

joe
bent
over
and
looked
at
her
earrings
a
tiny
woman
swung
from
a
trapeze
on
one
ear
an
elephant

patiently

other
pretty

he
too
sad
for
a
wedding
the
chairs
were
filling
joe
took
his
seat
next
to
sally
in
the
front
row
ingrid
sat
behind
them
with
max
a
bridesmaid
six
months
pregnant
wearing
a
light
blue
flowered
dress
stood
prettily
on
the
bluff
her
hands
clasped
around
lace
and
a
bouquet
of
white
roses
after
some
minutes
of
suspense
kate
and
jackson
walked
down
the
aisle
kate
was
lovely
in
white
jackson
wore
a
smashing
gray
suit
sally
wiped
away
a
tear
the
minister
smiled
gravely
vows
were
exchanged
spectacular
rings
made
by
jackson
and
a
friend
were
pushed
on
kate
and
jackson
kissed
cameras
flashed
simple
and
touching
a
rainbow
or
a
pod
of
breaching
orcas
would
have
been
too
much
they
moved
to
the
champagne
table
and
drank
toasts
before
departing
in
a
convoy
for
the
yacht
club
in
friday
harbor
designated
cleaners
stayed
behind
they
would
join
them
later
in
the
club
a
long
table
took
up
most
of
the
main
room
vases
of
flowers
were
regularly
spaced
along
the
white
tablecloth
places
were
set
for
at
least
sixty
people
name
cards
at
each
setting
in
a
corner
of
the
room
band
instruments
waited
by
empty
stools
joe
repaired
to
the
bar
in
the
next
room
a
short
intense
woman
pouted
when
he
ordered
glenlivet
that
so
easy
are
you
bored
want
to
practice
something
complicated
no
that
all
right
she
put
the
whiskey
in
front
of
him
with
a
quick
smile
one
scotch
and
then
wine
if
he
did
go
back
to
the
hard
stuff
after
dinner
he
survive
roasted
yellow
pepper
soup
was
followed
by
a
salad
of
spinach
and
scallops
salmon
with
a
thyme
sauce
and
risotto
with
wild
mushrooms
wine
servers
patrolled
vigilantly
joe
had
a
conversation
about
education
with
a
teacher
kate
had
met
on
a
vacation
in
tibet
there
were
sentimental
toasts
and
then
the
band
began
to
play
he
remembered
that
he
could
dance
and
he
took
a
turn
around
the
floor
with
the
mother
of
the
bride
sally
and
he
moved
easily
together
out
of
old
habit
time
went
backwards
and
then
into
slow
motion
as
the
band
worked
through
hits
of
the
and
joe
danced
with
anyone
available
and
when
no
one
was
available
he
danced
alone
occasionally
he
went
outside
on
a
long
porch
to
cool
off
in
a
fine
drizzle
that
was
drifting
in
from
the
harbor
a
group
gathered
around
the
wedding
cake
on
a
table
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
sally
and
ingrid
stood
together
looking
mellow
and
nostalgic
gunnar
and
bonnie
were
talking
with
friends
max
was
taking
pictures
it
was
time
to
go
joe
realized
he
had
told
kate
earlier
that
he
would
fade
away
at
the
appropriate
time
he
walked
through
the
bar
and
said
to
the
woman
who
had
served
him
the
scotch
your
little
girl
only
gets
married
once
he
went
out
the
door
and
down
the
steps
are
you
from
around
here
seattle
joe
turned
and
looked
back
up
at
the
bartender
who
had
followed
him
onto
the
porch
hawaii
uh
what
do
you
do
she
was
urgent
he
remembered
that
she
had
been
watching
him
dance
i
a
poet
he
said
the
words
fell
through
the
air
like
a
sentence
oh
a
good
one
i
sure
there
are
only
a
couple
of
us
joe
said
drunkenly
i
got
to
go
now
a
musician
on
break
watching
from
a
corner
of
the
porch
drew
on
his
cigarette
the
glow
lit
his
face
a
witness
someone
joe
would
never
know
i
got
to
go
joe
said
he
turned
and
walked
into
the
dark
and
the
rain
leaving
the
younger
generation
and
most
of
his
life
behind
joe
was
thirsty
the
next
day
fuzzy
but
not
totaled
dancing
had
worked
off
a
lot
of
the
booze
he
caught
the
clipper
back
to
seattle
and
sat
silently
for
three
hours
while
images
and
conversations
flowed
through
his
mind
the
wedding
had
been
a
great
success
well
organized
yes
but
mostly
because
kate
and
jackson
were
a
good
match
and
because
they
and
their
friends
all
had
the
same
attitude
let
have
a
good
time
let
do
it
right
it
was
a
relief
after
the
weddings
he
been
to
that
were
dominated
by
ancient
family
feuds
and
personal
problems
on
the
other
hand
no
flying
plates
no
loud
exits
no
sobbing
he
wondered
if
maybe
he
had
missed
something
it
was
too
bad
that
his
father
and
ann
had
been
there
probably
he
should
call
and
see
how
they
were
kate
would
check
in
no
doubt
she
and
his
father
had
a
warm
and
easy
relationship
the
clipper
docked
and
he
checked
in
at
his
home
away
from
home
his
mind
was
too
busy
for
sleep
so
he
took
his
notebook
down
to
the
bar
and
sipped
a
beer
by
the
window
the
writer
a
voice
said
in
a
husky
contralto
joe
looked
up
the
woman
in
a
wheelchair
who
had
watched
him
on
thursday
was
rolling
slowly
by
hi
joe
said
her
face
was
sad
and
intense
her
eyes
were
large
brown
and
circular
behind
round
glasses
her
hair
was
light
brown
shoulder
length
her
coloring
was
warm
slightly
flushed
whether
from
makeup
or
not
he
could
tell
she
wore
a
light
cotton
blouse
with
bark
colored
buttons
down
the
front
her
lap
was
covered
by
a
blanket
with
a
southwestern
motif
she
stopped
i
saw
you
in
here
the
other
night
what
are
you
writing
if
you
do
mind
my
asking
oh
nothing
he
said
closing
the
notebook
just
notes
my
daughter
got
married
this
weekend
ah
want
a
beer
or
something
he
felt
like
talking
she
turned
towards
the
table
and
he
moved
a
chair
out
of
the
way
thank
you
the
bartender
came
over
the
usual
she
said
he
brought
her
a
glistening
martini
i
like
a
vodka
martini
about
this
time
was
it
a
nice
wedding
very
out
on
the
san
juan
lovely
here
to
their
happiness
it
was
what
joe
had
spent
the
last
two
days
doing
he
drank
the
last
of
his
beer
and
ordered
another

was
working
on
a
story

other
night

offered

heater

isabelle
said
although
no
one
can
really

seemed
quite
experienced
in
her
early
forties
maybe
you
want
to
know
the
trouble
i
having
joe
asked
she
looked
amused

he
added

i
ca

the
jump
into
fiction
i
use
something
from
real
life
and
then
if
i
leave
anything
out

liar

said
looking
across
the
gray
water

quilt

of
patches
this
person

that
person
love
a
cat
you
knew
you
make
up
the
quilt
the
design
but
the
strength
of
it
its
integrity
comes
from
the
patches
she
finished
her
martini
joe
eyes
opened
wide
i
have
to
think
about
that
the
quilt
the
thing
she
said
offhandedly
you
have
to
care
about
it
she
swiveled
her
chair
and
held
her
arm
in
the
air
another
round
she
said
on
me
he
agreed
and
considered
what
she
said
a
patchwork
quilt

he
asked
they

joe
switched
to
wine
isabelle
started
laughing
more
apparently
she
had
all
the
money
she
needed
to
live
in
hotels
traveling
slowly
around
a
familiar
route
it
seemed
like
an
hour
but
it
was
probably
two
hours
later
when
she
pushed
back
from
the
table
time
to
move
she
said
hey
it
been
fun
he
was
letting
go
after
the
long
weekend
and
was
sorry
to
see
her
leave
she
smiled
slightly
how
about
a
nightcap
joe
sure
she
reached
into
a
small
bag
and
handed
him
a
key
card
i
really
have
to
go
back
to
my
room

asked

another
one
of
these
cards

you
call

room
she
wheeled
away
and
joe
leaned
back
in
his
chair
it
was
dark
outside
rain
trickled
down
the
windows
softening
the
harbor
lights
he
was
tired
of
being
alone
he
stared
at
the
harbor
and
savored
the
feeling
of
companionship
a
circle
of
two
in
league
against
a
rainy
night
was
it
marx
who
said
that
the
smallest
indivisible
human
unit
was
two
he
could
remember
he
knocked
and
entered
when
isabelle
answered
the
wheelchair
was
empty
at
the
end
of
the
bed
he
walked
past
the
bathroom
and
stopped
by
the
bed
isabelle
was
under
the
covers
propped
up
against
several
pillows
she
had
changed
into
a
white
nightgown
and
brushed
out
her
hair
good
timing
joe
i
ready
for
a
glass
of
wine
coming
up
he
said
embarrassed
he
opened
the
bottle
poured
two
glasses
and
brought
one
over
to
her
there
was
a
small
table
and
chair
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
oh
joe
come
here
so
we
can
talk
she
patted
the
bed
beside
her
as
though
he
were
a
cat
or
a
little
boy
take
off
your
shoes
you
might
as
well
be
comfortable
he
obeyed
slowly
there
was
a
dream
like
quality
in
the
room
a
scent
of
honeysuckle
she
pointed
a
remote
control
and
skipped
through
radio
stations
until
she
found
jazz
adult
music
he
said
balancing
his
wine
and
sliding
next
to
her
all
music
is
adult
she
said
with
the
possible
exception
of
disco
even
country
he
added
especially
country
this
job
and
shove
it
ha
you
all
right
isabelle
they
touched
glasses

this
coltrane

strange
joe
said
most
sax
players
sound
the
same
then
one
grabs
you
what
is
it
about
coltrane
deep
stuff
she
said
so
where

joe
on
her
way
back

both
were

of

and

yep

of

isabelle

he

the
wreck
that

up
he

a
bad
boy
she
said
smiling
sadly
i
sorry
if
it
had
happened
there
it
would
have
been
somewhere
else
she
seemed
to
say
the
words
more
bravely
than
she
felt
them
let
have
some
more
wine
then
he
hunched
himself
off
the
bed
and
refilled
their
glasses
you
a
handsome
guy
joe
good
manners
tougher
than
you
look
episcopal
i
bet

episcopal

pay
much
attention

it
true
that
episcopalians

baptized
in
harvey
bristol
cream

true
lucky
joe
she
took
another
drink
of
wine
i
know
something
about
you
tough
guys
oh

you
really
just
bad
boys
and
you
need

she
reached
for
a
book
on
the
bedside
table
i
am
revisiting
of
green
by
lucie
maude
montgomerie
good
grief
joe
said
isabelle
opened
to
the
first
page
and
began
reading
calmly
joe
stretched
his
legs
and
looked
at
the
ceiling
it
had
been
a
long
few
days
despite
himself
he
was
drawn
into
the
story
her
voice
was
low
and
soothing
he
nearly
fell
asleep
and
spilled
the
last
of
his
wine
isabelle
took
the
glass
from
his
hand
and
turned
out
the
light
your
hands
are
cold
she
said
get
under
the
covers
with
one
arm
she
pushed
him
sideways
and
held
up
the
blanket
and
sheet
he
rolled
under
and
next
to
her
she
took
his
hand
and
rested
it
on
her
stomach
that
better
she
said
he
registered
distantly
that
he
was
in
bed
with
a
woman
he
did
know
but
her
warm
body
and
the
soft
cotton
nightgown
under
his
hand
made
that
unimportant
it
was
a
good
place
to
be
he
snuggled
closer
and
she
sighed
he
began
to
caress
her
stomach
slowly
she
sighed
again
and
moved
her
hips
closer
his
fingertips
brushed
lightly
across
her
breasts
she
tipped
her
head
back
careful
she
warned
in
a
constricted
voice
he
continued
slowly
turning
on
his
side
and
pushing
his
face
against
her
upper
arm
he
brought
his
hand
down
and
stroked
lightly
along
the
curves
of
her
stomach
isabelle
placed
her
hand
on
his
and
pushed
it
lower
down
over
her
pelvis
he
moved
closer
and
rubbed
where
she
guided
her
body
tensed
he
stretched
out
fully
aroused
against
her
hip
her
breath
came
harder
it
was
important
now
what
was
happening
he
urged
her
on
she
made
a
loud
animal
sound
through
clenched
teeth
and
then
arched
and
let
out
a
series
of
sweet
whispered
collapses
bella
he
said
into
her
arm
bella
oh
you
are
such
a
bad
boy
joe
such
a
bad
boy
she
lay
still
a
few
moments
regaining
her
breath
and
then
reached
down
and
began
pulling
at
his
belt
oh
take
this
off
he
slid
out
of
his
clothes
there
she
said
there
he
was
lying
on
his
back
as
she
began
to
stroke
him
bella
you
called
me
i
like
that
she
said
stroking
bella
he
said
now
short
of
breath
himself
bella
she
stopped
you
like
your
bella
do
you
yes
she
started
again

off

over

chest
and
neck

as

fell

she
took
his
hand
and
pushed

over
the
warm
sperm

nightgown
and
pulled
his
hand
to
her
stomach

writhing
and
slippery
she
pushed
his
hand
to
his
chest
and
pulled
it
back
again
make
me
beautiful
she
said
in
a
smaller
voice
all
over
joe
tried
he
passed
out
in
the
morning
he
awoke
to
the
sounds
of
animated
conversation
he
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
waiting
for
his
brain
to
unscramble
his
head
was
pounding
gradually
he
realized
that
he
was
in
bed
next
to
isabelle
and
that
she
was
watching
tv
he
was
in
bad
shape
physically
but
he
felt
freer
than
he
had
in
a
long
time
top
of
the
mornin
he
said
lifting
his
head
and
opening
his
eyes
i
was
just
going
to
wake
you
up
isabelle
said
he
had
to
blink
and
focus
she
was
pale
and
looked
upset
her
arms
were
folded
in
front
of
her
shielding
her
breasts
i
ordered

joe
he
staggered
up
and
figured
out
how
to
put
on
his
pants
socks
and
shoes
took
a
little
doing
picking
up
speed
she
kept
watching
the
tv
isabelle
she
turned
her
head
and
shushed
him
with
one
finger
to
her
lips
just
go
joe
she
said
tightly
she
meant
it
but
he
did
even
know
her
last
name
isabelle
i
in
the
book
give
me
a
call
she
smiled
joe
could
tell
whether
she
was
glad
that
he
wanted
her
to
call
or
whether
she
was
forgiving
him
for
things
he
did
understand
he
wanted
to
hug
her
but
he
knew
that
he
should
she
changed
channels
he
blew
her
a
slow
kiss
and
left
the
room
waiter
pushed
a
stainless
steel
cart
past
him
in
the
hall
as
he
tried
to
remember
his
room
number
he
thought
it
was
he
want
to
go
down
to
the
lobby
and
admit
to
the
desk
clerk
that
he
was
too
messed
up
to
remember
his
room
number
he
took
the
elevator
up
one
floor
go
for
it
he
told
himself
and
slid
the
card
into
the
lock
a
green
light
flashed
yes
he
entered
his
room
and
considered
the
bed
still
made
what
the
hell
might
as
well
keep
going
he
thought
he
showered
and
lugged
the
filson
bag
down
to
the
restaurant
where
he
ate
a
waffle
with
strawberries
drank
coffee
and
two
glasses
of
water
he
assessed
the
situation
you
in
seattle
joe
airport
take
bus
save
money
it
was
a
smiley
morning
the
waitress
and
the
desk
clerk
were
in
good
moods
the
trolley
driver
was
singing
the
sun
was
shining
that
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
he
got
off
the
trolley
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
caught
a
city
bus
to
seatac
he
was
hours
early
and
had
saved
thirty
bucks
by
not
taking
a
taxi
he
snoozed
and
spaced
out
all
the
way
to
hawaii
and
home
hi
batman
where
the
party
batman
maintained
a
tolerant
silence
joe
took
two
aspirin
and
slept
for
fourteen
hours
friday
morning
joe
walked
to
the
farmer
market
and
bought
onions
bok
choy
lettuce
and
carrots
the
prices
were
good
the
locals
were
cheerful
it
was
a
good
deal
for
everyone
it
was
late
september
and
there
were
fewer
tourists
around
a
lone
conga
beat
tumbled
and
surged
across
kapiolani
park
the
smell
of
grilling
teriyaki
drifted
across
the
grass
small
cumulus
clouds
blew
out
to
sea
joe
sat
on
the
last
beach
before
diamond
head
a
place
where
he
and
sally
and
kate
had
often
come
on
weekends
an
older
man
the
age
joe
was
now
used
to
park
his
car
and
carry
a
rubber
raft
to
the
water
his
dog
would
jump
into
the
raft
and
the
man
would
push
it
out
swimming
slowly
until
they
were
a
hundred
yards
offshore
he
would
climb
into
the
raft
and
write
in
a
notebook
while
his
dog
rested
and
kept
watch
the
deeply
tanned
man
and
the
black
raft
floated
up
and
down
a
dark
silhouette
on
the
glinty
ocean
occasionally
the
man
paddled
to
keep
from
drifting
too
far
down
the
beach
probably
now
if
he
still
alive
joe
thought
time
to
get
serious
the
words
appeared
like
a
banner
in
joe
mind
to
his
surprise
he
had
told
the
woman
at
the
san
juan
yacht
club
that
he
was
a
poet
the
words
were
true
as
he
spoke
them
he
had
defined
himself
for
better
or
worse
whether
he
wrote
stories
or
poems
matter
he
could
do
both
what
mattered
was
to
get
to
work
isabelle
was
on
to
something
with
the
patchwork
quilt
the
faces
and
feelings
that
he
described
were
important
but
as
patches
he
needed
to
carry
his
writing
further
and
work
on
the
quilt
isabelle
he
shook
his
head
feeling
a
slight
flush
she
was
a
sharpie
no
doubt
about
it
she
got
right
to
him
but
she
was
well
down
the
alcoholic
road
she
did
have
to
work
she
did
have
children
joe
could
see
what
would
bring
her
back
it
was
the
drinking
so
much
that
put
him
off
it
was
the
lack
of
pride
or
purpose
or
will
power
that
the
drinking
implied
just
as
well
he
thought
that
there
was
an
ocean
between
them
you
could
define
adult
life
as
the
struggle
not
to
drink
too
much
he
said
to
mo
at
hee
hing
the
following
week
he
was
telling
her
about
isabelle
leaving
out
the
sex
there
too
much
to
do
to
feel
awful
all
the
time
she
said
quite
right
but
some
people
do
get
hangovers
they
just
a
little
fuzzy
in
the
morning
ingrid
was
like
that
i
ca
take
it
tea
that
the
stuff
he
said
drinking
from
a
small
round
cup
so
what
have
you
been
doing
oh
the
usual
she
said
i
been
over
to
kauai
a
few
times
i
got
a
decent
shot
of
the
cook
at
tops
jade
willow
lady
joe
said
yes
i
framing
a
large
one
for
my
next
show
whenever
that
is
i
anxious
to
see
it
i
forgot
to
tell
you
after
we
talked
last
i
checked
out
graduate
schools
and
applied
to
montpelier
they
accepted
me
for
the
semester
that
starts
right
after
christmas
congratulations
yeah
pretty
good
huh
joe
burke
software
bum
goes
for
an
mfa
but
i
not
sure
i
should
why
not
pretty
expensive
joe
said
what
would
it
cost
a
semester
times
four
he
frowned
i
got
enough
to
get
started
but
i
run
out
before
the
second
semester
there
loan
money
for
graduate
school
mo
said
i
guess
it
does
make
sense
from
a
financial
point
of
view
never
get
a
teaching
job
but
i
think
i
could
learn
something
you
have
to
make
a
commitment
mo
said
firmly
the
winter
residency
is
in
florida
for
preference
i
requested
older
women
of
independent
means
they
can
be
difficult
mo
said
how
come
florida
i
thought
the
school
was
in
vermont
the
summer
session
is
in
vermont
i
think
it
was
a
faculty
decision
they
leased
a
hotel
in
the
panhandle
joe
scratched
his
head
i
know
one
way
of
looking
at
it
is
that
part
of
the
money
would
pay
for
a
vacation
in
florida
it
way
over
near
alabama
i
never
been
in
that
part
of
the
state
mo
placed
her
chopsticks
neatly
across
her
plate
and
wiped
her
mouth
with
a
napkin
she
began
to
fidget
well
onward
joe
said
you
want
to
go
exploring
sometime
look
at
things
mmm
she
looked
out
the
window
i
awfully
busy
for
the
next
while
he
sighed
dramatically
i
just
have
to
go
myself
maybe
when
i
get
back
from
florida
give
me
a
call
she
said
they
left
as
usual
in
opposite
directions
on
kapahulu
avenue
she
was
like
a
figure
on
a
japanese
fan
slowly
unfolding
then
snapped
shut
let
it
be
he
thought
he
spent
the
next
few
days
working
on
a
story
about
the
time
he
and
morgan
found
a
cache
of
dynamite
hidden
by
the
weathermen
a
radical
group
in
the
late
he
described
the
lost
note
that
led
them
to
a
deserted
house
at
the
end
of
a
road
the
cold
cloudy
december
afternoon
the
shock
of
discovering
a
duffel
bag
in
the
crawl
space
under
the
house
the
cardboard
tubes
of
explosive
the
tangle
of
blasting
caps
and
the
ominous
silence
but
as
he
went
on
to
write
about
the
fbi
the
local
lawyer
and
the
lawyer
wife
he
began
to
lose
focus
one
thing
led
to
another
was
he
writing
a
story
or
a
novel
again
he
realized
that
he
had
a
lot
to
learn
he
was
worried
about
money
but
he
put
off
looking
for
a
job
he
could
decide
whether
or
not
to
go
to
florida
how
many
hours
could
he
work
if
he
became
a
full
time
student
one
evening
he
swung
through
his
door
stood
by
the
blinking
red
light
on
his
answering
machine
and
heard
ann
say
in
a
sad
voice
joe
i
sorry
to
have
to
shock
you
like
this
your
father
died
yesterday
please
call
me
if
you
get
in
by
eleven
or
so
our
time
damn
he
said
damn
it
was
past
midnight
maine
time
he
got
a
reduced
fare
to
boston
for
the
following
afternoon
on
an
emergency
basis
and
began
putting
things
into
his
filson
bag
and
then
taking
them
out
he
could
feel
anything
he
gave
up
packing
lowered
himself
to
his
mattress
and
waited
a
long
time
for
sleep
in
the
morning
he
called
ann
to
tell
her
that
he
would
be
there
the
next
day
in
the
afternoon
she
said
that
she
give
him
the
details
when
he
got
there
his
father
had
died
of
a
heart
attack
he
told
her
to
keep
her
chin
up
and
said
that
he
call
kate
kate
hi
dad
honey
i
got
bad
news
your
grandfather
died
the
day
before
yesterday
she
let
out
a
small
cry
and
was
silent
i
just
found
out
ann
called
i
going
out
there
for
a
couple
of
days
oh
poor
grandpa
i
had
a
dream
about
him
last
week
he
was
standing
by
the
painting
he
gave
me
the
one
of
the
woman
in
the
barn
door
and
he
was
smiling
at
me
very
loving
and
kind
oh
she
sobbed
and
her
voice
got
farther
away
as
though
she
had
dropped
her
arms
i
sorry
honey
he
had
a
good
life
joe
said
helplessly
he
pau
hana
now
she
said
yeah
joe
said
i
call
you
when
i
get
back
huh
dad
bye
honey
bye
dad
he
packed
two
changes
of
clothes
a
sweater
and
a
jacket
it
was
nearly
november
practically
winter
in
maine
so
long
batman
hold
the
fort
it
was
a
relief
to
trot
down
the
stairs
and
get
moving
at
midnight
boston
time
he
emerged
stiffly
from
the
plane
and
walked
into
logan
terminal
he
rented
a
small
car
and
stopped
for
the
night
at
the
first
motel
he
came
to
on
route
joe
opened
his
eyes
blinked
and
realized
that
he
was
in
a
motel
in
massachusetts
he
drove
to
portland
and
stopped
at
becky
on
the
waterfront
several
regulars
were
in
their
usual
seats
one
of
the
waitresses
had
gained
a
few
pounds
joe
ate
breakfast
and
sat
over
a
second
cup
of
coffee
enjoying
the
voices
and
feeling
that
he
changed
since
he
left
maine
he
felt
better
tougher
and
more
himself
but
he
was
sad
for
his
father
and
he
had
a
sense
of
loss
for
things
left
behind
his
maine
life
no
longer
quite
remembered
he
left
a
big
tip
and
hit
the
road
deer
isle
is
out
between
penobscot
bay
and
jericho
bay
it
a
romantic
place
softer
than
the
rest
of
maine
the
light
is
warmer
probably
that
was
what
attracted
his
father
joe
thought
he
took
the
fast
route
through
augusta
and
belfast
three
and
a
half
hours
later
the
deer
isle
bridge
came
suddenly
into
view
high
too
thin
an
arrow
shot
gracefully
over
eggemoggin
reach
joe
could
not
drive
over
it
without
remembering
that
its
sister
bridge
in
tacoma
shook
itself
to
pieces
by
he
was
bumping
down
his
father
road
the
barn
seemed
empty
when
he
stopped
in
front
ann
came
out
of
the
house
to
meet
him
she
was
wearing
a
denim
skirt
and
a
black
blouse
her
blonde
hair
was
braided
and
wound
behind
her
head
they
had
a
long
wordless
hug
ann
had
always
been
nice
to
him
and
he
was
glad
to
be
there
to
be
a
supportive
presence
she
sighed
and
stepped
back
how
nice
to
see
you
joe
brendan
here
he
flew
in
yesterday
hi
joe
brendan
his
half
brother
came
through
the
front
door
they
patted
each
other
on
the
arms
a
compromise
between
hugging
and
shaking
hands
brendan
a
sad
day
joe
said
yes
he
was
eleven
years
younger
than
joe
healthy
blonde
like
ann
and
squarely
built
like
their
father
his
stylish
short
haircut
regular
features
and
white
teeth
were
made
for
soap
opera
if
his
face
had
been
less
triangular
his
small
chin
set
in
front
of
a
strong
neck
gave
him
a
power
lifter
look
he
was
wearing
chinos
and
a
tight
fitting
short
sleeved
shirt
with
an
insignia
over
one
pocket
joe
stretched
the
sky
was
covered
with
an
even
layer
of
gray
cloud
it
was
unseasonably
warm
good
to
get
out
of
the
car
he
said
drove
up
from
boston
i
got
a
flight
to
bangor
yesterday
brendan
said

the
house

in
the
living
room

against
joe
ankle
jeremy

ann

my
last

did
realize
it
until
i
was
in
new
hampshire

great
friends
with
your
father

after
a
while
he

and
white

champion
mouser
as
if
to
take

bow
georgia
took
three
steps
in
from
the
hall
and
sat
at
the
edge
of
the
rug
since
we
all
here
ann
said
we
might
as
well

a
family
conference

a
glass

toasted
they
raised
their
glasses

and
were
silent

moment
i
have
something
to
tell
you

ann
looked
troubled
i
found
your
father
in
that
small
clearing
in
the
woods
on
his
regular
path
the
walk
he
took
most
days
after
lunch

one
thing
that
i
wanted
to
tell
you
both
it
was
very
strange
your
father
was
lying
on
that
flat
piece
of
ledge
he
was
stark
naked
i
knew
right
away
that
he
was
not
alive
i
did
want
anyone
to
see
him
like
that
so
i
dressed
him
before
i
came
back
the
memory
silenced
her
for
a
moment
why
would
he
be
like
that
i
thought
you
might
have
an
idea
i
understand
brendan
and
joe
looked
at
each
other
it
surprised
joe
to
realize
that
they
did
understand
that
they
were
in
fact
brothers
mother
you
said
it
was
hot
almost
like
summer
brendan
the
sun
must
have
felt
good
one
last
day
joe
said
sadly
he
could
have
taken
his
clothes
off
after
the
heart
attack
ann
said
do
you
think
he
felt
it
coming
we
never
know
mother
if
he
felt
it
coming
why
would
he
have
come
home
i
sure
he
would
have
tried
joe
said
she
was
struggling
with
being
excluded
or
not
being
included
in
a
final
intimacy
it
such
a
beautiful
spot
joe
said
maybe
he
just
wanted
to
lie
there
and
look
at
the
sky
yes
i
suppose
she
said
she
straightened
on
the
couch
and
pushed
the
question
to
the
back
of
her
mind
to
deal
with
later
he
was
lucky
to
have
you
for
so
many
years
joe
said
this
was
easier
for
him
to
offer
than
for
brendan
who
had
had
every
nuance
and
tension
between
his
parents
pressed
on
him
since
birth
thank
you
joe
now
we
must
talk
about
the
will
she
walked
to
a
writing
table
that
stood
in
a
bow
window
and
returned
with
checks
in
her
hand
the
estate
goes
to
me
with
the
exception
of
ten
thousand
dollars
to
each
of
you
and
ten
thousand
to
kate
she
gave
joe
two
checks
and
handed
the
other
to
brendan
this
is
coming
out
of
the
insurance
which
i
supposed
to
get
next
week
so
if
you
will
hold
these
until
the
first
of
the
month
she
smiled
there
a
stipulation
the
money
must
be
spent
within
one
year
on
something
that
makes
you
feel
good
that
should
be
hard
brendan
said
thank
you
joe
said
i
really
was
expecting
the
money
in
the
family
had
always
been
ann
although
his
father
paintings
had
begun
to
sell
in
recent
years
additionally
joe
you
are
to
have
this
drawing
of
your
mother
she
pointed
to
a
framed
drawing
that
was
propped
up
on
the
writing
table
and
first
choice
of
any
painting
in
the
barn
that
very
nice
joe
said
your
father
always
said
you
should
have
this
drawing
it
was
one
of
his
favorite
pieces
from
the
early
years
i
take
it
with
me
how
long
are
you
going
to
be
staying
she
asked
i
thought
i
take
off
the
day
after
tomorrow
i
just
wanted
to
see
you
and
brendan
and
i
be
here
all
week
brendan
said
if
anything
needs
doing
we
not
going
to
have
a
ceremony
he
did
want
one
ann
said
she
looked
down
at
the
floor
for
a
moment
and
then
raised
her
head
going
to
bake
something
if
you
boys
will
excuse
me
friends
are
going
to
start
coming
by
i
want
to
have
something
to
offer
them
chocolate
chips
asked
brendan
she
left
without
answering
and
they
finished
their
wine
in
silence
might
as
well
pick
a
painting
joe
said
brendan
came
with
him
to
the
barn
when
they
were
inside
brendan
said
the
old
goat
joe
spotted
his
father
special
stash
of
laphroaig
and
reached
for
it
to
the
old
goat
he
said
and
took
a
healthy
swallow
he
passed
the
bottle
to
brendan
you
all
right
brendan
brendan
drank
and
cleared
his
throat
yowsir
joe
searched
through
paintings
mostly
oils
and
chose
a
small
one
unframed
that
had
been
done
earlier
that
year
a
spring
scene
of
the
woods
at
the
edge
of
the
field
behind
the
barn
the
leaves
were
just
out
and
his
father
had
captured
the
delicate
early
green
chartreuse
that
is
gone
in
a
week
the
young
leaves
were
modestly
and
unashamedly
tender
there
was
nice
work
with
interarching
birches
among
the
other
trees
and
in
the
meeting
of
the
woods
and
the
field
but
the
light
on
the
leaves
was
the
main
act
a
good
one
brendan
said
not
too
big
easy
to
mail
i
bet
you
could
carry
it
on
the
plane
if
you
packed
it
brendan
said
they
rummaged
around
and
found
a
shipping
box
just
large
enough
for
the
painting
and
the
drawing
good
idea
joe
said
now
i
even
have
the
money
to
frame
it
how
are
you
doing
these
days
by
the
way
not
bad
i
teaching
a
course
at
a
community
college
of
course
the
bay
area
is
expensive
wheeler
making
the
big
bucks
it
a
full
time
job
just
keeping
him
out
of
trouble
making
sure
he
eats
right
and
so
on
brendan
grinned
i
ca
imagine
what
the
house
is
going
to
be
like
when
i
get
back
wheeler
has
put
anything
away
since
he
was
born
he
just
picks
things
up
and
carries
them
to
different
places
creative
chaos
joe
said
great
until
you
need
the
garlic
press
i
with
you
joe
said
i
hate
looking
for
things
wheeler
is
an
excellent
fellow
though
he
pictured
wheeler
very
tall
hawk
nosed
wearing
glasses
bent
over
an
architectural
drawing
the
top
of
his
head
seeming
to
glow
oh
i
could
survive
without
him
brendan
said
taking
another
swallow
of
laphroaig
he
was
a
hard
man
our
father
maybe
you
know
not
having
lived
with
him
and
all
i
suppose
so
joe
said
did
he
give
you
a
hard
time
when
you
umm
came
out
no
brendan
said
he
was
fine
about
that
works
he
said
it
was
the
art
thing
that
any
other
way
of
life
was
less
worthy
helping
in
the
community
working
with
people
he
could
see
that
as
important
it
would
have
been
for
him
i
guess
brendan
shrugged
i
can
draw
you
know
but
i
never
got
off
on
it
joe
reached
out
and
patted
him
on
the
back
not
knowing
what
to
say
they
went
into
the
house
and
joe
packed
the
drawing
with
the
oil
painting
he
put
the
box
on
the
back
seat
of
the
rental
car
and
stopped
to
pick
a
few
strawberries
from
the
patch
of
everbearing
plants
by
the
end
of
the
barn
i
love
those
strawberry
plants
he
said
to
ann
in
the
kitchen
october
and
they
still
working
your
father
loved
them
too
joe
prowled
around
the
bookshelves
and
found
an
arthur
upfield
mystery
that
he
had
read
great
stuff
he
said
later
as
they
ate
a
light
dinner
of
soup
and
salad
off
to
yet
another
corner
of
australia
while
napoleon
bonaparte
gets
his
man
the
keen
senses
of
the
aboriginal
combined
with
the
rational
faculties
of
the
white
man
brendan
said
of
a
is
the
one
i
remember
ann
said
year
after
year
the
lake
shrinking
the
birds
the
fish
she
shuddered
more
wine
mother
yes
a
little
the
next
day
passed
quietly
brendan
split
and
joe
stacked
a
large
pile
of
firewood
ann
went
shopping
they
took
naps
brendan
and
joe
went
out
for
dinner
to
the
fisherman
friend
now
that
a
haddock
plate
joe
said
finest
kind
brendan
agreed
la
nouvelle
cuisine
has
not
reached
stonington
they
had
coffee
and
mammoth
pieces
of
pie
ann
seems
to
be
taking
it
pretty
well
joe
said
she
a
trooper
brendan
said
what
was
your
mother
like
you
know
i
grew
up
with
that
drawing
whenever
i
saw
you
i
always
felt
the
similarity
joe
leaned
back
in
his
chair
surprised
well
she
was
a
trooper
she
was
talented
i
guess
do
you
think
of
her
often
hardly
ever
not
very
good
memories
like
joe
sipped
coffee
she
was
always
leaving
me
places
once
when
i
was
six
she
left
me
with
an
old
couple
in
new
york
they
were
very
old
they
made
me
stay
in
a
playpen
for
a
week
a
week
yeah
it
was
torture
i
was
used
to
having
the
run
of
the
block
it
was
summer
the
playpen
was
by
a
window
where
i
could
see
the
street
that
was
good
anyway
i
remember
the
dust
floating
in
the
room
how
awful
brendan
said
memories
rushed
into
joe
mind
as
though
a
lock
had
been
picked
i
used
to
listen
to
radio
shows
every
day
at
five
sergeant
preston
of
the
yukon
and
his
great
dog
king
on
king
aroofroofroof
joe
looked
around
the
dining
room
and
lowered
his
voice
i
found
a
dime
on
the
couch
one
afternoon
and
showed
it
to
my
mother
did
you
get
that
she
wanted
to
know
found
it
on
the
couch
lie
to
me
she
said
stole
it
did
you
maggie
told
me
the
kids
were
taking
money
from
little
sean
tell
me
the
truth
i
found
it
on
the
couch
lying
it
five
sergeant
preston
not
listening
to
the
radio
until
you
tell
me
the
truth
joe
made
a
face
i
was
so
desperate
to
hear
sergeant
preston
that
i
told
her
i
stole
the
dime
brendan
was
silent
she
would
believe
me
joe
said
that
was
the
worst
she
would
believe
me
brendan
looked
at
the
napkin
joe
had
crumpled
in
one
hand
and
he
shook
his
head
i
guess
joe
said
putting
the
napkin
ball
on
the
table
if
i
wanted
to
be
adult
about
it
i
say
she
was
too
high
strung
one
of
these
people
with
major
league
talent
but
without
the
courage
to
use
it
too
bad
brendan
said
we
know
people
like
that
in
san
francisco
he
was
genuinely
sympathetic
i
glad
we
had
a
chance
to
talk
joe
said
on
their
way
out
right
on
joe
made
ann
and
brendan
promise
to
visit
him
in
hawaii
ann
told
them
that
she
had
decided
to
stay
on
in
the
house
at
least
for
a
while
she
needed
time
to
adjust
she
had
friends
on
the
island
and
money
enough
to
cope
with
the
coming
winter
joe
said
that
he
would
be
leaving
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
that
they
should
bother
getting
up
to
say
goodbye
he
slept
restlessly
and
dressed
at
first
light
ann
was
already
up
you
must
have
coffee
at
least
she
said
it
smells
great
thanks
he
poured
milk
from
a
little
pitcher
into
a
mug
decorated
with
a
maine
public
radio
logo
just
like
your
father
ann
said
ready
to
go
in
the
morning
mmm
delicious
goodbye
jeremy
he
said
to
the
cat
who
was
rubbing
against
his
ankle
anxious
to
be
let
out
well
get
going
then
take
the
mug
keep
it
maybe
it
will
remind
you
of
maine
and
help
bring
you
back
thanks
ann
it
was
very
good
to
see
you
and
brendan
take
care
of
yourself
he
leaned
forward
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
she
followed
him
outside
and
picked
up
jeremy
holding
him
tawny
and
orange
against
her
white
bathrobe
as
joe
drove
away
he
bought
a
doughnut
in
bucksport
and
took
the
coastal
route
for
old
time
sake
he
stopped
for
breakfast
at
moody
in
waldoboro
had
changed
much
in
twenty
years
they
extended
the
dining
room
the
area
had
gotten
larger
waitresses
ran
chattering
back
and
forth
to
the
kitchen
unimpressed
as
ever
with
anyone
who
did
not
live
in
lincoln
county
he
ate
bacon
eggs
toast
and
homefries
taking
his
time
the
whirlwind
visit
to
deer
isle
was
still
sinking
in
he
was
having
trouble
accepting
that
his
father
was
dead
it
was
good
of
him
to
have
left
the
money
and
joe
was
very
glad
to
have
the
painting
and
the
drawing
of
his
mother
first
choice
that
had
been
a
message
of
some
kind
he
like
brendan
felt
that
his
father
had
been
disappointed
in
him
for
not
living
a
more
artistic
life
too
late
to
talk
about
it
now
overboard
and
gone
by
as
they
said
on
deer
isle
he
was
a
hard
man
brendan
had
said
in
the
barn
brendan
was
right
although
you
had
to
know
his
father
well
to
realize
it
what
with
the
big
smile
the
blarney
and
all
montpelier
joe
decided
the
creative
writing
program
that
was
the
thing
to
do
it
would
be
carrying
on
something
of
his
father
in
him
and
the
inheritance
would
take
care
of
his
immediate
money
problems
when
he
left
moody
he
was
still
sad
but
at
least
he
had
a
plan
he
stopped
in
portland
for
the
night
thinking
that
there
was
no
telling
when
he
be
back
he
decided
not
to
look
up
ingrid
she
was
off
and
into
her
new
life
he
got
a
room
at
the
holiday
inn
and
walked
around
the
west
end
his
old
neighborhood
houses
were
being
restored
coffee
shops
had
opened
all
over
the
place
popeye
the
bar
with
the
tail
of
a
light
plane
sticking
out
from
its
roof
was
just
the
same
as
he
walked
up
gray
street
joe
saw
the
small
man
who
used
to
collect
his
returnable
bottles
he
was
on
his
knees
in
front
of
dominic
a
large
church
that
had
been
closed
and
put
up
for
sale
by
the
catholic
bureaucracy
his
shopping
cart
was
beside
him
half
full
of
cans
and
bottles
the
day
had
turned
sharply
cold
joe
felt
a
rush
of
complicated
emotion
how
could
this
man
with
nothing
kneeling
on
the
sidewalk
before
an
empty
church
be
so
complete
or
so
realized
joe
wanted
to
salute
him
as
he
used
to
in
the
old
days
after
he
handed
over
the
bottles
but
he
did
not
disturb
him
he
went
instead
to
a
coffee
shop
and
tried
to
describe
the
scene
later
the
sun
was
setting
as
he
passed
dominic
joe
stood
for
a
few
minutes
and
watched
a
glowing
veil
withdraw
inexorably
up
the
red
brick
tower
of
the
church
it
was
as
though
the
bottle
saint
had
gone
and
the
service
was
over
joe
felt
like
crying
but
he
was
too
cold
and
alone
he
ate
dinner
in
giobbi
a
local
bar
and
restaurant
with
dark
booths
along
two
walls
a
messy
meeting
was
in
progress
at
tables
that
had
been
pushed
together
in
the
center
of
the
room
joe
held
pizza
in
one
hand
and
wrote
in
his
notebook
with
the
other
while
men
in
late
middle
age
joked
and
argued
a
man
at
one
end
of
the
tables
clinked
his
glass
one
thing
we
got
ta
take
care
of
he
said
clink
clink
one
piece
of
business
clink
the
group
fell
quiet
now
he
cleared
his
throat
now
you
all
know
agnes
sure
she
been
good
to
us
all
right
yes
yes
agnes
now
some
of
you
may
not
know
the
story
about
her
there
were
several
questioning
sounds
and
the
group
fell
silent
this
is
what
happened
about
seventy
years
ago
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
of
the
church
it
was
a
wild
rainy
morning
and
the
father
asked
one
of
the
nuns
to
see
who
it
was
she
opened
the
door
no
one
was
there
only
a
basket
she
brought
the
basket
in
out
of
the
rain
and
said
a
baby
father
all
wrapped
in
a
sheet
the
father
thought
must
take
care
of
it
he
said
it
a
boy
or
a
girl
the
nun
bent
over
unwrapped
the
baby
and
said
girl
father
bless
her
must
have
a
name
father
said
is
a
child
of
god
that
we
know
agnes
will
be
her
name
he
looked
at
the
window
and
said
not
much
of
a
day
out
we
will
call
her
agnes
grayborn
so
the
nuns
took
her
and
raised
her
and
agnes
has
worked
all
her
life
for
the
church
and
now
boys
we
had
to
sell
the
building
where
agnes
lives
she
has
no
place
to
go
voices
raised
and
mumbled
a
hand
came
up
halfway
down
the
group
i
got
ta
small
place
in
one
of
mine
i
take
care
of
it
least
we
can
do
thanks
tony
yes
clapping
agnes
glasses
were
held
up
well
all
right
joe
thought
he
left
and
walked
toward
the
holiday
inn
every
once
in
a
while
things
work
out
the
way
they
should
he
felt
his
resolve
to
keep
going
it
was
in
him
like
a
fist
i
too
am
a
hard
man
he
said
sunny
honolulu
joe
was
relieved
to
be
back
he
wrote
to
kate
enclosing
her
inheritance
check
and
explaining
his
father
stipulation
concerning
the
money
no
problem
she
back
we
out
every
weekend
looking
at
houses
joe
paid
his
montpelier
tuition
and
put
some
money
in
the
bank
but
he
could
resist
buying
shares
of
a
company
that
he
been
following
on
the
internet
an
italian
whose
father
was
in
the
steel
business
had
developed
a
new
type
of
composite
steel
stainless
steel
tubes
were
packed
with
crushed
recycled
carbon
steel
and
then
rolled
under
heat
and
pressure
bonding
the
whole
together
the
resulting
composite
or
cladded
steel
had
the
outer
resistance
of
stainless
but
was
much
cheaper
there
was
a
huge
market
for
rebar
to
be
used
in
concrete
exposed
to
the
weather
particularly
in
marine
environments
and
in
roads
that
were
salted
during
the
winter
the
italian
joined
forces
with
a
british
financier
who
had
a
good
reputation
they
entered
a
joint
venture
with
a
korean
firm
that
subsequently
withdrew
support
for
reasons
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
quality
of
the
product
their
venture
went
bankrupt
but
the
two
hung
in
there
and
repurchased
the
mill
that
they
had
established
in
wales
they
issued
stock
for
operating
capital
and
began
to
produce
test
quantities
of
the
new
steel
joe
bought
the
stock
at
roughly
the
value
of
the
existing
mill
and
property
if
the
were
multiplied
by
the
number
of
shares
outstanding
his
thinking
was
that
he
was
getting
the
life
work
of
the
italian
for
nothing
and
that
the
product
was
bound
to
catch
on
eventually
for
a
small
added
expense
the
life
of
a
bridge
could
be
effectively
doubled
the
brit
had
a
track
record
of
success
he
owned
a
significant
fraction
of
the
company
and
sold
a
single
share
the
company
would
either
license
the
process
to
a
steel
giant
or
be
bought
outright
joe
was
fairly
sure
of
this
the
question
was
when
he
had
learned
his
lesson
with
southwest
precious
metals
and
he
bought
for
the
long
haul
an
investment
not
a
trade
definitely
fun
he
said
in
the
direction
of
maine
and
his
father
whom
he
thought
of
as
still
being
somewhere
near
the
barn
on
thanksgiving
after
his
second
annual
dinner
of
parrot
fish
and
black
bean
sauce
joe
returned
home
and
pushed
the
play
button
on
the
answering
machine
he
heard
piano
chords
an
intro
and
then
rich
low
voice
joe
where
are
you
tonight
a
few
bars
of
melody
followed
joe
she
broke
off
with
a
strained
laugh
and
hung
up
uh
oh
joe
said
she
sounded
drunk
and
far
away
as
though
she
were
trying
to
sing
across
an
ocean
he
did
think
that
she
was
on
the
island
good
thing
he
said
to
himself
but
he
was
sad
for
her
the
old
johnny
cash
song
went
through
his
mind
got
to
walk
that
lonesome
valley
you
got
to
walk
it
by
she
was
in
trouble
for
sure
the
phone
rang
he
hesitated
and
picked
it
up
on
the
third
ring

air
of
invincible
solidity

hair

closely
trimmed

casual

on
his
way

conference

protocols

the
century

gave

my
joe

an
programmer

jason
nodded
sympathetically
joe
was
confused
the
best
banjo
player
he
ever
heard
was
returning
from
an
international
data
conference
in
high
school
jason
was
a
football
player
and
a
star
in
the
drama
club
i

joe
said
it
was
burning
out
my
brain
i
never
much
liked
it

jason
said
how

you
get
into
the
info
game
one
thing
leads
to
another
he
said
you
pitch
in
give
a
hand
go
with
the
flow
he
expanded
as
he
talked
his
jaw
was
set
as
he
carved
into
his
mauna
kea
half
a
papaya
beneath
eruptions
of
granola
fruit
and
yogurt

me
in

frowned

joe
said

joe
said
jason
sighed
yeah

a
crap

on
guy
joe
was
sorry
to
see
him
leave
jason
had
carried
his
talent
for
theater
into
the
business
world
he
had
taken
on
the
role
of
front
man
and
image
projector
his
job
was
to
walk
the
walk
talking
the
talk
while
his
colleagues
fried
their
brains
in
the
midnight
hours
no
doubt
he
done
it
with
his
usual
wholeheartedness
he
earned
his
toys
and
if
the
banjo
was
in
the
back
seat
took
second
place
what
difference
did
it
make
so
long
as
he
was
contributing
and
doing
his
best
too
bad
about
wes
joe
thought
daisy
was
strong
hang
in
there
babe
he
said
he
sent
them
a
christmas
card
a
beach
scene
by
a
local
artist
a
large
hawaiian
woman
in
a
flowered
dress
lay
on
her
side
in
four
inches
of
water
three
small
children
playing
on
her
held
fast
as
a
tiny
wave
broke
before
them
joe
kept
to
his
routine
writing
each
day
the
steel
company
dropped
to
on
light
trading
he
thought
about
buying
more
but
he
held
back
for
his
father
painting
he
chose
a
linen
mat
and
a
natural
cherry
frame
he
hung
the
painting
over
his
table
and
watched
the
light
moving
from
outside
the
frame
onto
the
green
leaves
and
into
the
woods
behind
might
as
well
have
the
best
batman
he
said
he
put
the
drawing
of
his
mother
above
an
unfinished
pine
bookcase
that
he
bought
to
hold
the
books
that
had
accumulated
on
the
floor
he
bought
two
towels
a
set
of
count
sheets
and
pillow
cases
and
a
le
creuset
saucepan
he
stopped
short
of
buying
a
real
bed
although
it
was
no
longer
unthinkable
he
received
a
package
of
stories
from
montpelier
written
by
the
ten
students
in
his
assigned
workshop
group
one
account
of
a
young
and
world
weary
gay
woman
was
sweet
and
clear
most
of
the
students
seemed
to
be
in
their
twenties
or
thirties
his
back
gave
him
a
scare
one
morning
as
he
bent
over
to
tie
his
shoes
but
he
stood
up
slowly
and
the
pain
went
away
he
bought
a
yoga
book
written
for
people
with
back
problems
and
began
to
exercise
he
spent
the
holidays
alone
kate
and
jackson
were
visiting
parents
max
was
busy
on
christmas
eve
he
strolled
through
waikiki
exchanging
ironic
smiles
with
other
missing
persons
in
one
of
the
hotel
lobbies
a
filipino
with
a
deep
tan
sang
roasting
chestnuts
on
an
open
fire
two
days
later
joe
slung
the
filson
bag
over
his
shoulder
his
apartment
was
clean
festive
even
with
christmas
cards
taped
to
the
kitchen
door
frame
back
soon
batman
he
said
joe
flew
to
florida
and
spent
the
night
in
tallahassee
he
rented
a
car
and
took
the
coastal
route
through
apalachicola
and
panama
city
toward
fort
walton
beach
apalachicola
was
a
sleepy
caribbean
place
palm
trees
dirt
alleys
low
concrete
buildings
built
for
hurricanes
he
munched
fried
shrimp
and
sipped
a
glass
of
beer
at
a
restaurant
by
the
slow
moving
mouth
of
the
apalachicola
river
a
solitary
pelican
waited
on
a
sunny
piling
a
hundred
writers
in
one
spot
i
do
know
he
thought
he
envied
the
pelican
learn
as
much
as
you
can
he
told
himself
the
school
had
rented
space
in
a
community
built
on
a
barrier
island
that
separated
the
gulf
from
a
wide
bay
you
a
day
early
see
your
unit
is
ready
we
can
let
you
in
the
woman
behind
the
registration
counter
gave
him
a
key
and
a
paper
pass
show
this
at
the
gate
she
said
gate
across
the
highway
over
there
she
pointed
through
the
front
windows
joe
drove
across
and
held
the
pass
out
the
car
window
a
security
guard
motioned
him
through
and
he
followed
a
blacktop
road
along
the
edge
of
a
golf
course
passing
clusters
of
houses
that
had
been
built
at
the
same
time
from
the
same
ten
designs
expanses
of
grass
were
broken
by
strips
of
pine
trees
and
mounds
of
tended
shrubbery
he
stopped
and
checked
the
map
he
been
given
two
older
men
bounced
low
drives
down
a
fairway
they
followed
their
balls
silently
dragging
golf
bags
behind
them
on
two
wheeled
carts
with
long
curved
handles
joe
unit
was
empty
and
impersonal
first
come
first
served
he
decided
he
hung
his
shirts
in
the
master
bedroom
closet
spread
the
rest
of
his
stuff
on
the
bed
and
fled
he
walked
past
landscaped
ponds
and
drainage
canals
to
the
conference
center
where
they
were
to
eat
and
attend
readings
joe
introduced
himself
and
was
told
that
meals
would
begin
the
following
morning
at
books
written
by
the
faculty
were
for
sale
in
a
room
arranged
as
a
temporary
store
he
picked
up
copies
of
writing
by
each
of
the
other
workshop
groups
his
preference
for
housemates
was
not
honored
walter
a
lawyer
from
california
and
jamie
a
newly
retired
military
officer
from
new
hampshire
arrived
the
next
day
walter
had
been
expensively
educated
but
his
mother
was
a
singer
and
he
had
inherited
her
talent
after
graduation
he
toured
for
years
with
a
rock
band
before
settling
down
to
appellate
work
and
raising
a
family
he
was
determined
to
write
a
novel
to
lead
another
life
jamie
was
a
sensitive
type
who
hid
behind
a
thick
layer
of
masculinity
we
call
him
man
one
of
the
women
later
told
joe
derisively
she
was
good
looking
the
good
looking
ones
did
trust
jamie
jamie
was
masculine
he
had
been
shot
in
vietnam
had
trained
for
special
forces
dirty
missions
and
had
flown
carrier
jets
he
was
good
at
games
in
shape
for
his
forties
dressed
for
a
magazine
cover
at
all
times
and
endlessly
charming
he
was
also
drunk
for
the
entire
residency
but
he
managed
to
get
through
it
without
being
thrown
out
montpelier
administration
was
no
challenge
to
jamie
after
the
pentagon
where
his
final
assignment
was
to
impress
members
of
congress
with
new
weapons
and
the
military
can
do
attitude
one
look
at
the
toys
and
they
would
come
in
their
pants
never
lost
an
appropriation
ha
ha
ha
his
glance
drifted
out
the
window
to
the
wetlands
behind
the
house
he
told
joe
of
a
tracheotomy
in
the
jungle
a
soldier
shot
and
dying
in
his
arms
he
died
happy
he
thought
i
was
going
to
save
him
joe
had
no
wish
to
compare
masculinity
with
jamie
joe
lived
in
the
reverse
disguise
his
strength
hidden
beneath
layers
of
sensitivity
he
spent
more
time
with
walter
besides
eugenie
one
of
the
faculty
had
fallen
for
jamie
and
was
with
him
as
often
as
she
could
find
him
the
students
were
divided
into
two
groups
fiction
and
poetry
joe
was
in
fiction
and
glad
of
it
as
he
came
to
meet
more
students
the
poets
were
high
strung
they
tended
to
lapse
into
proud
and
delicate
silences
the
fiction
writers
were
gregarious
given
to
loud
laughter
round
tables
in
the
dining
room
usually
filled
with
one
group
or
the
other
on
their
second
day
the
students
were
scheduled
to
meet
with
faculty
members
joe
and
walter
traipsed
about
the
development
and
talked
to
half
a
dozen
of
the
most
interesting
teachers
joe
asked
whether
they
considered
themselves
artists
and
if
so
what
they
understood
that
to
mean
one
rubbed
his
forehead
and
said
it
was
a
good
morning
he
had
at
least
thought
about
it
generally
yes
the
faculty
members
considered
themselves
artists
but
mumble
mumble
they
accepted
the
status
and
the
authority
but
they
were
confused
about
the
responsibility
that
art
did
or
did
not
entail
one
of
the
more
widely
published
professors
had
read
a
story
the
previous
night
joe
asked
him
if
he
felt
that
it
was
good
enough
to
write
a
story
which
posed
questions
but
made
no
attempt
to
answer
them
in
this
manner
over
the
course
of
two
days
joe
pissed
everybody
off
as
a
reward
he
was
assigned
to
roland
the
most
intimidating
faculty
member
joe
had
always
identified
with
artists
but
art
meant
painting
in
what
way
were
writers
artists
he
did
intend
to
annoy
the
faculty
he
was
trying
to
get
his
money
worth
workshops
were
carefully
choreographed
each
student
writing
was
scheduled
for
uninterrupted
discussion
led
by
two
faculty
members
the
writer
was
not
allowed
to
speak
until
the
discussion
was
complete
everyone
else
in
the
group
was
expected
to
contribute
day
after
day
joe
group
analyzed
and
explored
stories
avoiding
judgments
about
their
quality
did
developments
in
the
story
make
sense
in
terms
of
earlier
events
which
characters
were
convincing
what
was
the
story
about
the
faculty
was
good
at
this
and
the
new
students
improved
as
days
went
by
students
who
had
been
there
a
few
semesters
set
a
good
example
joe
thought
hard
about
what
to
say
in
each
session
he
became
more
aware
of
story
as
a
form
or
structure
independent
of
the
characters
and
setting
he
still
did
get
it
he
did
know
what
a
story
was
but
he
was
discouraged
he
had
learned
from
designing
computer
systems
that
there
was
always
a
period
of
absorbing
information
before
he
could
see
the
big
picture
his
own
story
was
praised
for
the
occasional
good
sentence
and
criticized
for
its
lack
of
structure
the
best
part
of
it
was
a
description
that
joe
copied
from
memory
a
late
evening
with
daisy
do
hold
back
she
had
said
he
had
begun
to
shake
in
her
arms
deep
uncontrollable
shaking
that
took
him
all
the
way
back
to
some
wordless
time
when
he
was
a
baby
daisy
held
him
until
he
was
reborn
as
a
man
clean
as
the
sun
beyond
fear
no
one
in
the
group
mentioned
this
scene
but
several
of
the
women
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
one
night
joe
heard
voices
in
the
living
room
and
stumbled
out
half
asleep
to
see
what
was
happening
eugenie
and
jamie
were
close
together
on
the
couch
he
excused
himself
and
went
back
to
bed
two
days
later
he
came
back
after
a
reading
and
there
was
jamie
in
the
center
of
the
living
room
weaving
slightly
holding
a
tennis
racquet
you
have
to
feel
it
he
said
flexing
his
wrist
like
a
friend
oh
i
understand
eugenie
said
her
face
flushed
and
happy
like
my
cello
joe
slipped
by
closed
his
bedroom
door
and
put
his
head
between
two
pillows
the
days
blurred
together
jamie
was
more
and
more
out
of
it
when
it
came
time
to
leave
walter
and
eva
a
cheerful
recovering
alcoholic
who
had
been
in
joe
workshop
helped
scrape
jamie
stuff
together
after
a
tearful
farewell
from
eugenie
they
assisted
jamie
into
the
rental
car
eugenie
is
facing
major
heartbreak
the
stuff
of
literature
eva
said
eugenie

i
joseph
conrad
jamie
explained
apologetically
sprawled
against
the
side
window
as
they
passed
eglin
air

thundered
up
up
and
away
looka
those
beauties
pulling
g
he
said
when
they
parted
at
the
terminal
eva
surprised
joe
with
a
kiss
she
had
a
lover
in
vermont
or
did
she
it
was
too
late
for
joe
to
figure
it
out
he
boarded
his
plane
feeling
that
in
his
pursuit
of
fiction
he
had
missed
a
good
person
roland
had
assigned
him
a
long
reading
list
of
contemporary
stories
and
french
criticism
some
of
this
is
a
little
esoteric
you
can
handle
it
he
said
roland
was
impressed
that
joe
had
made
a
living
as
an
independent
computer
programmer
joe
was
to
mail
in
a
criticism
of
each
book
along
with
short
stories
of
his
own
there
was
a
lot
to
sort
through
cleo
who
had
written
about
the
gay
woman
had
impressed
him
she
had
short
black
hair
deep
brown
eyes
that
were
intelligent
and
sympathetic
and
a
clear
spirit
she
reminded
him
of
maxie
arrowhead
in
its
kauri
wood
box
am
i
missing
something
here
eva
had
said
in
joe
ear
one
afternoon
is
she
friggin
beautiful
or
what
friggin
beautiful
joe
said
like
her
writing
jesus
eva
said
it
works
that
way
sometimes
joe
said
i
seen
it
in
paintings
beautiful
people
can
do
beautiful
work
they
are
afraid
of
it
they
used
to
it
eva
looked
at
him
she
was
herself
although
not
in
cleo
league
joe
head
was
spinning
from
two
weeks
of
conversation
at
breakfast
lunch
dinner
and
points
in
between
it
was
a
relief
to
be
in
the
plane
seated
next
to
an
elderly
woman
who
had
no
interest
in
writing
he
had
scheduled
a
stopover
in
san
francisco
but
when
he
arrived
he
could
bring
himself
to
call
brendan
he
was
too
tired
to
socialize
he
spent
a
day
walking
about
the
city
and
was
able
to
buy
almost
all
of
the
books
on
his
reading
list
he
would
have
to
wait
for
any
of
them
to
be
delivered
to
honolulu
after
an
uneventful
flight
and
a
satisfying
view
of
diamond
head
joe
climbed
the
stairs
to
his
apartment
a
cloth
shopping
bag
filled
with
paperbacks
in
one
hand
his
filson
bag
in
the
other
yo
batman
new
books
mo
swirled
special
noodles
around
in
her
bowl
so
did
you
find
out
what
a
story
joe
handed
her
a
manila
envelope
here
one
he
said
a
story
is
about
change
is
of
change
it
obvious
i
guess
but
i
could
see
it
my
instructor
roland
finally
said
joe
for
god
sake
in
a
story
sooner
or
later
something
has
to
happen
to
somebody
joe
shook
his
head
i
kept
trying
to
stop
time
like
a
painter
i
got
it
now
stories
model
take
place
in
time
the
meaning
is
embodied
in
the
movement
like
a
dance
you
ca
separate
them
he
sipped
tea
the
school
has
been
good
but
i
stopping
after
this
semester
too
expensive

joe
cheeks
flushed
slowly
so
that
was
why
she
had
been
so
hard
to
reach
rob
and
i
have
known
each
other
a
long
time

i
tell

she
said
into
the
middle
distance
but
she
shrugged
and
smiled
ca
wait
to
read
your
story
they
split
the
bill
and
left
hee
hing
promising
to
get
together
soon
joe
went
straight
to
the
moana
gilbert
i
got
trouble
what
her
name
good
old
gilbert
joe
was
upset
he
had
thought
of
mo
as
a
possible
partner
or
lover
he
had
leaned
on
her
without
realizing
it
it
was
to
be
wilcox
was
it
always
about
money
no
that
was
fair
he
had
another
drink
and
began
to
feel
freer
we
all
grown
up
here
he
said
in
the
direction
of
the
beach
he
ordered
one
for
the
road
and
toasted
your
problem
now
wilcox
to
hell
with
it
he
declared
the
day
over
and
ambled
up
kalakaua
avenue
smiling
at
strangers
when
he
got
home
he
found
a
letter
with
three
british
stamps
and
a
london
return
address
it
was
from
sarah
the
girl
who
had
stuck
to
her
story
about
mike
the
cat
burglar
she
had
married
a
brit
and
had
two
children
of
her
own
i
read
your
letter
to
my
daughters
and
told
them
that
parents
sometimes
make
mistakes
i
can
remember
it
as
clearly
as
if
it
were
yesterday
she
wrote
i
hope
mike
has
found
another
way
to
make
a
living
please
do
thank
him
for
being
nice
if
you
should
see
him
the
thought
of
sarah
reading
his
words
to
her
children
filled
joe
with
pleasure
he
immediately
wrote
to
alison
thanking
her
for
encouraging
him
to
write
and
deliver
the
story
a
week
later
a
square
envelope
arrived
from
madison
wisconsin
it
was
a
wedding
announcement

joe
knocked
on
his
wooden
table
top
and
wished
her
luck
he
sent
her
a
lavish
congratulations
card
a
month
later
joe
finished
his
last
school
assignment
we
on
our
own
batman
he
said
carrying
the
packet
for
roland
out
the
door
he
kept
writing
and
submitted
stories
to
the
paris
review
manoa
ploughshares
and
the
new
yorker
things
happened
in
each
of
them
he
was
making
progress
but
he
was
satisfied
the
stories
were
rejected
with
form
letters
sometimes
not
even
form
letters
form
scraps
fortunately
there
was
more
in
the
mail
than
rejection
slips
kate
and
jackson
found
a
house
in
the
ballard
section
of
seattle
mo
sent
an
invitation
to
an
opening
party
for
her
new
business
max
sent
pictures
of
stone
man
watching
over
the
valley
joe
taped
the
pictures
on
the
wall
near
his
father
painting
his
steel
company
stock
fell
to
down
by
a
third
of
his
original
investment
buy
more
he
thought
but
he
was
afraid
of
running
out
of
money
and
being
forced
to
sell
at
a
loss
he
kicked
himself
for
buying
so
much
at
if
he
bought
half
as
much
he
could
have
picked
up
some
of
these
bargain
shares
remember
that
he
told
himself
you
have
to
buy
it
all
at
once
joe
settled
more
deeply
into
his
routine
one
morning
in
a
coffee
shop
he
looked
up
and
realized
that
a
young
woman
was
watching
him
from
a
corner
table
he
had
seen
her
before
sitting
in
the
same
corner
sketching
she
was
in
her
late
teens
slightly
built
her
hair
was
shoulder
length
a
fresh
mahogany
brushed
back
from
her
face
she
had
artist
eyes
open
and
steady
similar
in
color
to
her
hair
but
lighter
she
caught
him
looking
and
smiled
a
knowing
smile
for
someone
so
young
her
teeth
were
so
white
and
her
look
was
so
proud
and
gentle
so
female
that
he
felt
a
sharp
pain
it
was
like
being
pierced
by
a
thin
hot
wire
he
smiled
back
as
best
he
could
and
left
quickly
the
next
morning
the
young
woman
looked
at
him
calmly
from
her
usual
seat
in
the
corner
of
the
coffee
shop
i
did
a
drawing
of
you
would
you
like
it
sure
joe
rose
from
his
table
and
walked
over
she
handed
him
a
pencil
drawing
that
showed
him
sitting
head
forward
looking
down
the
lines
were
simplified
but
intense
his
head
was
like
a
hatchet
about
to
strike
it
embarrassed
joe
to
realize
that
this
maniacal
stranger
was
him
or
her
perception
of
him
there
was
life
in
it
it
is
very
good
she
said
i
like
it
thanks
i
trade
i
give
you
some
writing
she
seemed
pleased
she
had
signed
the
drawing
in
one
corner
rhiannon
that
a
beautiful
name
i
never
heard
it
before
it
welsh
oh
i
joe
burke
irish
he
meant
it
as
a
joke
but
it
sounded
in
his
ears
like
a
warning
or
an
acknowledgment
of
kinship
so
you
work
around
here
club
the
clothing
boutique
on
the
corner
i
do
start
until
ten
but
i
like
to
get
up
early
get
out
of
the
apartment
that
explained
her
stylish
outfits
she
put
her
sketch
book
her
pencils
and
her
cd
player
into
a
backpack
and
waved
goodbye
the
next
day
he
gave
her
four
poems
handwritten
on
heavy
stock
that
he
bought
in
the
art
store
next
to
the
coffee
shop
awesome
she
said
putting
them
carefully
in
her
pack
i
starting
a
novel
he
said
i
could
never
write
a
book
do
you
live
around
here
my
mother
has
a
place
on
wilder
avenue
not
far
from
me
on
liholiho
she
smiled
her
unsettling
smile
and
began
drawing
their
conversations
were
short
each
felt
the
need
for
privacy
the
back
tables
of
the
coffee
shop
became
their
studio
for
an
hour
or
two
nearly
every
morning
gradually
joe
saw
that
rhiannon
was
beautiful
she
had
no
spectacular
features
it
was
the
whole
combo
working
together
that
was
beautiful
hair
eyes
mouth
clear
skin
proud
compact
walk
feeling
flickered
on
her
face
like
firelight
she
was
stubborn
joe
could
see
that
but
at
the
same
time
she
laughed
at
herself
they
were
a
lot
alike
and
she
knew
it
that
was
why
her
smile
troubled
him
to
deny
her
was
to
deny
himself
the
coffee
shop
was
cheerful
in
the
early
morning
many
of
the
customers
were
young
and
worked
in
the
surrounding
shops
rhiannon
joked
with
them
but
maintained
a
friendly
distance
once
a
young
man
came
over
to
her
table
and
said
i
been
watching
you
draw
he
was
important
about
it
as
though
he
were
a
judge
of
drawing
yes
she
said
hobby
or
are
you
a
student
or
a
professional
or
something
hobby
she
said
and
went
back
to
work
the
judge
bent
over
her
table
nice
he
said
rhiannon
said
nothing
and
he
retreated
joe
avoided
her
eyes
he
could
feel
her
glance
and
he
was
starting
to
grin
one
morning
she
asked
for
the
bathroom
key
the
gal
behind
the
counter
tossed
the
key
toward
the
bathroom
door
it
was
attached
to
a
large
key
ring
and
crashed
loudly
on
the
floor
one
of
your
most
valued
customers
rhiannon
protested
bending
over
for
the
key
when
she
emerged
from
the
bathroom
she
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
five
foot
three
and
threw
the
key
back
on
the
floor
joe
could
help
laughing
she
was
so
intense
and
funny
about
it
she
had
said
her
mother
had
a
place
so
he
guessed
that
her
father
was
around
her
parents
were
probably
divorced
maybe
not
so
long
ago
she
was
too
self
possessed
not
to
have
been
well
loved
as
a
child
on
the
day
of
mo
business
opening
rhiannon
announced
that
she
had
the
afternoon
off
joe
had
the
invitation
to
the
opening
in
his
shoulder
bag
and
showed
it
to
her
she
a
terrific
photographer

said

to
go
rhiannon
looked
down
at
her
black
cotton
pants
and
touched
her
i
have
to
change
it
not
until
four
she
a
working
gal
it
wo
be
fancy
rhiannon
looked
at
him
as
though
he
were
retarded
and
agreed
to
meet
him
there
at
later
joe
went
home
and
changed
into
one
of
his
better
aloha
shirts
he
waited
for
rhiannon
at
the
bus
stop
nearest
to
mo
but
she
surprised
him
by
getting
out
of
a
charley
cab
in
front
of
the
door
yo
rhiannon
he
trotted
up
i
thought

by

quick
hug

back
and
he
introduced

hand
was
palm
up
ready
to
reach
it
was
as
though
she
had
seen
mo
with
the
camera
and
had
paused
as
she
was
turning
toward
the
grill
light
fell
on
her
face
through
wisps
of
steam
the
print
was
taller
than
it
was
wide
cropped
below
her
forearms
the
background
was
distinct
but
shaded
the
light
was
all
on
her
face
as
she
considered
her
balance
in
the
act
of
maintaining
it
she
was
magnificent
she
rose
above
time
by
letting
it
go
holding
nothing
back
he
uh
painted
a
girl
a
young
woman
in
much
the
same
way
although
she
was
cooking
anything
awesome
rhiannon
said
jade
willow
lady
who
she
cooks
at
tops
in
kaneohe
mo
and
i
went
to
look
at
her
once
that
what
i
called
her
so
beautiful
rhiannon
said
joe
went
for
more
wine
as
he
maneuvered
to
the
table
he
noticed
a
man
about
seventy
with
a
familiar
profile
joe
realized
that
he
was
mo
father
excuse
me
joe
said
reaching
for
a
bottle
of
sauvignon
blanc
i
was
just
thinking
about
taxes
during
the
reign
of
caesar
augustus
would
you
have
an
opinion
on
that
ha
ha
a
lot
depended
on
who
was
doing
the
collecting
are
you
looking
for
a
system
to
replace
the
it
time
do
you
think
i
joe
burke
a
friend
of
your
daughter
i
read
your
book
arthur
soule
he
said
shaking
hands
you
got
endurance
i
enjoyed
it
actually
he
took
a
sip
of
wine
i
come
to
believe
that
systems
matter
less
than
the
people
who
run
them
he
had
a
dapper
air
amused
and
ironic
i
could
agree
more
joe
said
the
two
carried
on
getting
into
the
stock
market
and
economics
in
general
arthur
seconded
henry
hazlitt
argument
that
selective
tax
breaks
were
almost
always
counterproductive
when
seen
in
the
context
of
the
society
as
a
whole
from
time
to
time
joe
looked
for
rhiannon
she
was
moving
slowly
about
the
main
room
studying
each
picture
and
talking
with
men
who
were
circling
her
like
bees
when
he
and
arthur
ran
out
of
conversation
he
caught
her
eye
and
pointed
questioningly
at
the
door
she
nodded
and
they
slipped
out
into
the
early
evening
air
i
walk
you
home
if
you
headed
that
way
he
offered
i
suppose
i
am
she
said
that
was
fun
you
looked
like
you
were
having
fun
i
noticed
wendell
sasaki
paid
you
a
lot
of
attention
he
nice
he
has
a
gallery
did
he
tell
you
yes
he
said
to
come
by
any
time
i
bet
he
did
joe
teased
she
pulled
a
light
cotton
sweater
from
her
bag
and
put
it
on
with
lithe
movements
it
cooling
off
she
said
good
pictures
huh
i
liked
them
rhiannon
said
but
i
do
know
anything
about
photography
winifred
is
very
nice
mo
that
what
i
call
her
she
is
is
she
your
girlfriend
no
joe
laughed
he
was
going
to
brush
off
the
question
but
he
saw
that
rhiannon
was
serious
almost
he
said
we
are
too
much
the
same
i
think
too
pigheaded
or
or
something
connected
to
rob
the
guy
we
met
when
we
first
went
in
rhiannon
brightened
the
afternoon
cumulus
clouds
had
dissipated
in
a
pale
blue
sky
pink
wisps
of
cirrus
trailed
to
the
west
they
walked
down
kapiolani
boulevard
and
turned
up
keaumoku
did
you
go
to
school
here
he
asked
roosevelt
i
graduated
last
year

do
sound
like
you

here
all
your
life

years
rhiannon
said

parents

divorced
and
i
came
out
here
with
my
mom

joe
said

and
upstate
new
york

in
new
haven
i

those
old
yale
buildings

rhiannon
agreed
my
father

think
much
of
yalies
good
man
joe
said
so
what
does
your
mom
do
she
works
in
marketing
rhiannon
said
abruptly
what
wrong
with
that
oh
nothing

along
right
now
i
do
like
her
boyfriend
uh
oh
that

joe
said
he
such
a
creep
i
get
my
own
apartment
but
i
leaving
never
had
an
apartment
it
fun
joe
said
do
what
you
want
but
you
have
to
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
beds
and
toasters
and
things
actually
i
do
even
have
a
bed
i
sleep
on
a
camping
mattress
i
would
mind
that
rhiannon
said
would
you
show
me
your
place
some
time
sure
people
should
do
what
they
want
to
she
said
fiercely
damn
right
although
it
not
so
easy
sometimes
the
more
they
talked
the
more
comfortable
he
felt
with
her
well
she
sighed
when
they
reached
her
apartment
building
good
night
joe
good
night
rhiannon
see
you
in
the
morning
i
be
there
summer
was
almost
gone
joe
and
rhiannon
crossed
the
boulevard
at
the
ewa
end
of
ala
moana
park
and
walked
toward
the
beach
the
weather
was
warm
and
overcast
for
a
change
rhiannon
chattered
about
her
upcoming
trip
to
see
her
father
in
connecticut
joe
made
his
standard
suggestion
to
pack
only
one
bag
he
offered
the
use
of
his
filson
but
she
wanted
her
own
and
besides
she
was
sure
when
she
was
coming
back
they
were
relaxed
with
each
other
joe
from
habit
and
rhiannon
from
instinct
sometimes
love
is
easy
he
thought
it
just
a
given
just
there
why
deny
it
even
so
he
was
afraid
to
touch
her
to
open
the
door
to
pain
and
loss
and
sexual
inadequacy
old
age
was
coming
soon
enough
he
did
have
to
have
his
nose
rubbed
in
it
an
admiring
whistle
cut
through
his
thoughts
three
young
men
were
standing
by
a
tree
in
front
of
them
and
to
their
right
joe
nudged
rhiannon
to
the
left
changing
direction
but
she
would
have
none
of
it
she
kept
her
direction
and
held
her
head
high
right
here
baby
one
of
them
was
slim
and
tense
two
were
heavier
they
were
eighteen
or
nineteen
rhiannon
age
they
moved
to
block
the
walk
joe
and
rhiannon
stopped
fucking
haole
one
said
coming
up
to
them
he
pushed
joe
hard
time
slowed
joe
sensed
rhiannon
reaching
into
her
bag
as
joe
stepped
back
from
the
shove
the
slim
one
slipped
to
the
side
i
going
down
anyway
joe
thought
he
held
the
shover
eyes
smiled
slightly
and
jammed
him
under
the
chin
with
the
heel
of
his
hand
driving
him
back
and
turning
him
he
grabbed
at
joe
but
joe
drove
him
face
down
into
the
gravel
joe
scrambled
sideways
and
was
spinning
toward
the
others
when
the
lights
went
out
he
came
up
from
a
deep
hole
and
opened
his
eyes
he
closed
them
and
opened
them
again
more
slowly
rhiannon
was
looking
into
his
face
far
above
her
a
cop
was
looking
down
joe
remembered
the
young
guys
he
lifted
his
head
it
joe
they
gone
he
put
his
head
back
down
for
a
moment
and
then
rolled
to
his
side
he
stood
up
with
help
from
rhiannon
he
was
bruised
and
bleeding
from
a
scrape
on
his
cheek
but
nothing
seemed
broken
he
let
out
a
breath
what
happened
i
called
on
my
cell
phone
i
was
just
going
by
the
cop
said
you
lucky
they
ran
when
they
saw
the
cruiser
rhiannon
said
my
partner
too
fat
to
catch
them
officer
watanabe
said
you
going
to
be
all
right
i
think
so
joe
said
touching
the
back
of
his
head
he
looked
at
rhiannon
are
you
yes
she
said
did
they
take
anything
no
you
want
to
come
down
to
headquarters
and
try
identify
them
kids
joe
said
i
guess
not
i
should
have
stayed
out
of
this
end
of
the
park
up
to
you
officer
wanatabe
said
he
wrote
down
their
addresses
thanks
joe
said
that
what
we
here
for
we
hang
around
ask
a
few
questions
joe
and
rhiannon
crossed
over
to
the
shopping
center
he
congratulated
her
on
having
a
cell
phone
i
should
have
had
pepper
spray
she
said
angrily
i
getting
some
today
i
going
home
joe
you
sure
you
do
want
your
face
looked
at
they
kicked
you
after
that
one
guy
hit
you
with
something
the
little
one
he
was
so
little
the
skinny
one
yeah
rhiannon
said
they
the
ones
you
got
to
watch
joe
said
i
go
home
and
clean
up
take
a
couple
of
aspirin
take
it
easy
i
know
rhiannon
said
i
make
you
dinner
joe
could
talk
her
out
of
it
at
five
she
was
standing
at
his
door
holding
a
grocery
bag
she
was
wearing
square
cut
black
cotton
pants
and
a
maroon
sweatshirt
pushed
up
on
her
forearms
her
hair
was
brushed
back
joe
was
shocked
again
at
how
untouched
and
beautiful
she
was
he
smelled
freshly
baked
bread
smells
good
i
did
know
how
hungry
you
be
i
made
a
quiche
you
can
warm
it
up
tomorrow
if
you
do
want
it
are
you
kidding
he
led
her
into
the
apartment
and
she
took
possession
of
the
kitchen
area
i
got
something
for
you
joe
said
he
handed
her
a
book
on
vermeer
oooh
she
said
my
contribution
to
your
education
cool
thanks
within
minutes
a
meal
appeared
on
the
table
how
do
you
cook
without
pans
joe
a
pot
and
a
wok
what
more
do
you
need
really
joe
she
sniffed
his
olive
oil
i
knew
i
should
have
brought
some
she
said
he
uncorked
a
bottle
of
chianti
and
gave
her
the
house
glass
i
use
the
mug
happy
days
happy
days
joe
they
began
on
the
quiche
joe
put
down
his
fork
after
the
first
bite
this
is
damned
good
rhiannon
nodded
calmly
i
love
this
she
said
reaching
for
maxie
box
she
opened
it
it
an
arrowhead
from
vermont
my
stepson
max
found
it
she
weighed
the
arrowhead
in
her
palm
as
he
had
max
made
the
box
he
was
in
new
zealand
it
a
special
wood
from
there
kauri
it
called
rhiannon
placed
the
arrowhead
back
in
its
oval
and
turned
the
box
around
looking
at
it
from
each
side
joe
pointed
at
the
picture
of
stone
man
he
did
that
too
rhiannon
leaned
over
the
table
and
looked
closely
at
the
photograph
her
eyes
opened
wider
awesome
he
balances
there
and
watches
over
the
valley
his
hands
are
weights
man
maxie
calls
him
looks
like
new
england
yup
vermont
londonderry
i
know
where
londonderry
is
she
said
my
father
took
us
skiing
there
good
old
maxie
max
mueller
you
should
look
him
up
when
you
go
back
east
i
will
she
said
when
are
you
going
a
week
from
tomorrow
oh
yes
i
had
the
ticket
for
two
months
he
poured
them
more
wine
rhiannon
leaned
back
in
the
plastic
chair
looked
at
the
painting
over
the
table
and
then
studied
the
drawing
above
the
bookshelf
my
father
did
those
joe
said
he
did
the
painting
last
year
not
long
before
he
died
the
drawing
is
of
my
mother
she
was
much
older
than
you
are
she
was
beautiful
rhiannon
said
not
as
beautiful
as
you
joe
said
factually
i
could
do
that
she
said
pointing
at
the
drawing
she
indicated
the
oil
but
i
could
do
that
color
ups
the
ante
joe
said
awesome
she
said
still
looking
at
the
oil
takes
time
joe
said
there
about
fifty
years
practice
between
the
two
and
then
gone
all
that
experience
gone
rhiannon
said
got
ta
do
it
while
we
can
joe
said
god
what
a
good
dinner
i
hate
to
see
you
go
rhiannon
do
you
get
lonely
she
asked
an
appealing
smile
spread
across
her
face
joe
imagined
her
clothes
dropping
away
saw
her
naked
her
clean
tight
skin
touches
of
private
color
at
her
breasts
the
subtle
curve
where
she
would
swell
with
pregnancy
he
shook
his
head
more
to
clear
it
than
to
say
no
batman
he
said
batman
keeps
me
company
although
i
do
worry
about
him
sometimes
he
younger
than
i
am
joe
could
i
stay
for
the
week
until
my
plane
she
spoke
quietly
and
held
him
with
her
large
dark
eyes
he
should
have
seen
it
coming
but
he
was
surprised
umm
with
me
she
nodded
oh
rhiannon
you
think
i
too
young
she
said
no
that
not
it
rhiannon
you
are
not
too
young
he
searched
for
words
it
not
you
it
me
i
too
old
he
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
wine
there
was
a
time
when
i
would
have
crawled
around
the
island
for
you
on
my
hands
and
knees
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain
she
stood
turned
once
around
and
sat
down
again
you
do
have
to
it
all
right
and
besides
you
wounded
she
pointed
at
the
on
his
cheek
i
not
that
wounded
i
changing
did
you
ever
see
a
chameleon
change
color
no
she
said
i
had
one
on
that
branch
right
out
there
he
pointed
through
the
glass
of
the
lanai
door
it
was
brown
each
time
i
looked
it
was
a
little
less
brown
and
a
little
more
green
you
could
barely
see
it
change
rhiannon
looked
impatient
when
it
was
completely
green
it
jumped
onto
a
leaf
that
was
the
same
color
joe
paused
it
writing
i
want
to
do
now
i
ready
to
jump
i
probably
kick
myself
for
the
rest
of
my
life
he
said
but
i
calling
a
cab
to
take
you
home
rhiannon
gathered
her
things
they
rode
the
elevator
down
in
silence
but
as
they
waited
for
the
cab
she
sighed
and
leaned
against
joe
he
put
his
arm
around
her
you
have
to
take
love
where
you
find
it
she
said
my
father
told
me
that
joe
squeezed
her
tighter
your
father
right
the
cabbie
pulled
in
joe
gave
him
the
address
and
double
the
fare
keep
the
change
huh
thanks
brah
rhiannon
rolled
down
the
window
and
turned
her
face
to
him
she
held
his
eyes
until
the
cab
turned
out
into
the
street
joe
walked
up
the
stairs
feeling
heavier
with
each
step
scent
lingered
in
the
apartment
he
did
want
to
bother
batman
with
his
troubles
so
he
put
on
and
finished
the
chianti
he
felt
terrible
he
had
denied
love
in
order
to
protect
himself
and
his
precious
writing
he
was
a
selfish
asshole
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
it
was
a
good
thing
that
he
was
out
of
wine
in
the
morning
he
returned
to
their
cafe
if
rhiannon
wanted
she
could
see
him
there
without
making
a
big
deal
about
it
she
did
not
appear
a
week
later
he
arrived
home
in
the
afternoon
to
see
a
box
by
the
door
he
knew
immediately
that
it
was
from
her
he
opened
it
and
found
an
object
wrapped
in
white
tissue
paper
he
unwound
the
paper
and
found
a
doll
she
was
dressed
in
a
kimono
and
had
japanese
features
an
eternal
bittersweet
look
she
was
gorgeous
a
note
read
her
name
is
sumoko
i
made
her
for
batman
i
leaving
today
love
rhiannon
joe
took
the
doll
and
a
napoleon
bonaparte
mystery
out
on
the
lanai
batman
someone
is
here
to
meet
you
he
laid
the
book
on
the
table
and
put
sumoko
and
batman
next
to
each
other
on
their
backs
with
the
book
as
a
pillow
looking
towards
the
mountain
we
see
what
happens
he
said
to
himself
and
to
rhiannon
who
was
probably
at
thirty
thousand
feet
what
a
sweetheart
he
slid
the
lanai
door
closed
and
made
himself
sit
at
the
computer
and
enter
what
he
had
written
earlier
as
he
worked
he
forgot
about
himself
and
sumoko
he
was
pleasantly
surprised
later
to
see
her
with
batman
they
seemed
to
be
getting
along
morgan
father
an
historian
once
told
joe
that
habits
are
a
best
friends
joe
stuck
to
his
practice
of
writing
all
morning
in
coffee
shops
and
then
walking
home
and
entering
the
words
into
his
computer
by
he
had
a
clean
printout
ready
for
the
next
day
he
exercised
and
spent
quiet
evenings
reading
watching
the
news
and
thinking
about
the
next
day
work
he
stopped
going
to
the
cafe
where
he
had
met
rhiannon
a
month
went
by
and
he
made
progress
he
was
feeling
good
when
he
happened
to
meet
mo
one
day
at
the
shopping
center
he
asked
if
she
wanted
to
have
lunch
she
consulted
her
little
red
book
and
turned
over
a
page
a
week
from
friday
too
long
i
ca
live
without
you
how
about
a
drink
under
the
boardwalk
he
said
bursting
into
song
under
the
banyan
tree
she
sighed
and
gave
in
tomorrow
she
offered
five
a
little
after
good
deal
joe
arrived
early
and
had
a
congenial
visit
with
gilbert
it
was
september
and
the
beach
was
uncrowded
joe
felt
as
much
as
a
haole
can
that
it
was
his
island
that
he
had
a
right
to
be
there
mo
showed
up
and
ordered
a
lillet
on
the
rocks
happy
to
have
closed
shop
for
the
day
slow
but
promising
she
said
of
her
business
he
complimented
her
on
the
jade
willow
lady
picture
i
was
lucky
she
said
it
took
some
darkroom
work
to
get
it
right
but
i
was
lucky
with
the
shot
i
only
took
four
i
was
so
afraid
of
disturbing
her
i
gave
her
a
print
she
was
surprised
pleased
i
think
i
love
to
have
one
i
put
it
up
in
my
apartment
and
be
reminded
to
eat
out
once
in
awhile
of
course
mo
said
you
named
her
do
you
need
reminding
to
eat
out
homey
joe
he
said
i
working
my
ass
off
i
loved
your
story
by
the
way
she
said
i
could
see
that
balding
bus
boy
carefully
loading
his
cart
but
i
wanted
more
yeah
joe
said
i
ca
tell
you
how
many
times
i
thought
of
that
guy
did
i
tell
you
that
i
started
a
novel
no
mo
said
you
right
about
the
stories
they
are
enough
it
a
new
experience
for
me
a
novel
it
taking
everything
i
got
mo
nodded
and
clapped
slowly
juggling
she
said
huh
i
was
remembering
a
story
jung
told
about
a
juggler
who
was
feeling
bad
because
he
had
nothing
to
offer
the
virgin
mary
at
a
festival
he
asked
the
village
priest
what
to
do
the
priest
told
him
that
he
must
juggle
for
the
blessed
virgin
so
he
did
and
was
filled
with
grace
it
was
joe
turn
to
clap
my
nephew
actually
does
juggle
mo
said
i
want
to
dress
him
in
a
red
and
yellow
medieval
costume
and
take
pictures
he
uses
long
sticks
they
extend
his
arms
and
make
him
seem
more
like
a
dancer
than
a
juggler
so
fluid
and
precise
at
the
same
time
all
you
need
is
the
costume
joe
said
and
my
nephew
he
going
to
school
in
north
carolina
she
drank
and
smiled
to
herself
you
changed
she
said
you
look
calmer
what
happened
to
prettylocks
i
ca
remember
her
name
rhiannon
she
went
back
east
to
see
her
father
he
changed
the
subject
speaking
of
fathers
how
is
yours
rolling
along
she
said
we
going
to
get
together
at
my
over
the
holidays
i
planning
to
visit
kate
joe
said
maybe
we
should
get
together
at
the
caffe
ladro
mo
smiled
noncommittally
and
they
parted
on
a
friendly
note
she
had
said
anything
about
rob
wilcox
and
he
had
asked
he
and
mo
were
going
to
connect
with
work
and
art
it
seemed
the
personal
or
the
intimate
would
stay
in
the
background
nothing
wrong
with
that
joe
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
home
several
days
later
the
phone
rang
joe
picked
it
up
on
the
second
ring
hi
joe
max
hey
how
are
you
good
the
reason
i
calling
is
i
got
a
call
last
week
from
a
woman
asking
if
she
could
come
see
stone
man
rhiannon
joe
said
yeah
rhiannon
she
said
that
she
saw
the
picture
of
stone
man
at
your
place
so
what
happened
joe
asked
she
showed
up
she
was
great
she
made
a
drawing
of
stone
man
and
hung
out
for
awhile
joe
heard
familiar
music
in
the
background
what
the
music
chesapeake
bay
sea
chanteys
the
cassette
was
in
your
truck
ha
ha
that
what
i
thought
the
banjo
player
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
i
listened
to
that
tape
all
across
the
country
there
a
song
on
there
about
how
you
counted
a
lucky
drudger
if
you
ever
get
your
pay
he
sang
the
words
right
max
said
so
did
you
like
her
rhiannon
yeah
she
said
she
come
back
in
two
weeks
and
cook
me
a
decent
meal
if
i
wanted
she
was
critical
of
the
kitchen
like
a
little
countess
or
something
joe
laughed
her
father
a
chef
i
guess
you
lucky
drudger
you
remember
my
maxim
about
what
to
do
when
you
really
attracted
to
a
woman
tell
her
max
said
and
added
where
my
quarter
i
invest
it
for
you
she
the
real
thing
max
joe
paused
when
you
see
her
tell
her
sumoko
and
batman
are
spending
a
lot
of
time
together
cool
max
said
who
sumoko
she
explain
good
old
max
maybe
he
and
rhiannon
would
get
together
impossible
to
predict
joe
thought
but
he
could
keep
his
fingers
crossed
a
month
after
maxie
call
two
years
after
he
had
left
portland
joe
made
coffee
and
read
the
beginning
of
his
novel
he
squared
the
pages
and
leaned
back
it
was
the
best
he
could
do
given
what
he
knew
about
the
story
so
far
when
he
finished
the
first
draft
he
would
start
over
and
add
things
to
better
frame
the
questions
that
the
story
answered
and
he
would
take
things
out
that
did
matter
the
phone
rang
joe
the
voice
was
husky
like
isabelle
but
it
turned
up
at
the
corners
and
had
texas
in
it
daisy
yes
i
in
san
francisco
wes
died
in
july
i
know
joe
said
i
sorry
i
just
heard
i
was
going
to
write
i
be
in
honolulu
tomorrow
i
wondered
when
will
you
be
here
in
the
afternoon
i
on
my
way
to
auckland
to
visit
adam
my
son
adam
i
thought
i
would
break
up
the
trip
and
maybe
get
to
see
you
she
was
staying
at
the
moana
on
morgan
recommendation
they
agreed
to
meet
at
five
joe
was
in
a
mild
state
of
shock
when
he
put
down
the
phone
there
was
no
unfinished
business
between
them
he
had
offered
her
everything
he
had
and
she
had
chosen
wes
it
had
been
clean
and
terrible
honest
and
final
now
thirty
years
later
here
they
were
again
here
where
deep
down
he
knew
his
face
was
still
buried
in
her
hair
his
lips
by
her
ear
do
you
know
how
many
of
us
there
are
in
the
world
not
very
many
she
said
would
always
say
joe
worked
the
rest
of
the
day
out
of
habit
but
he
did
not
sleep
well
he
was
half
an
hour
early
at
the
moana
wearing
his
best
blue
aloha
shirt
his
mustache
trimmed
his
fingers
drumming
on
the
bar
gilbert
brought
him
a
glenlivet
and
left
him
alone
at
five
minutes
to
five
daisy
walked
out
of
the
hotel
and
down
the
wide
steps
he
knew
her
first
by
her
walk
tall
and
careful
and
then
as
she
approached
by
her
face
which
was
fuller
more
deeply
lined
but
still
good
humored
and
direct
they
embraced
beneath
the
banyan
she
fit
in
his
arms
and
against
his
shoulder
as
comfortably
as
ever
joe
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
that
was
sappy
so
he
said
nothing
she
stepped
back
and
looked
closely
at
him
they
exchanged
compliments
sat
at
a
round
table
and
began
to
catch
up
she
told
him
about
wes
how
he
had
refused
to
quit
smoking
and
had
succumbed
to
lung
cancer
her
daughter
and
granddaughter
were
back
living
at
home
recovering
from
a
divorce
adam
was
working
on
a
timber
plantation
joe
told
her
about
kate
max
and
his
two
marriages
no
regrets
they
agreed
how
could
you
regret
a
life
which
produced
your
children
joe
told
her
about
his
writing
and
how
he
would
face
running
out
of
money
when
it
happened
he
did
need
much
as
long
as
he
could
keep
writing
he
could
drive
a
cab
again
or
work
in
a
bookstore
and
besides
he
brightened
remembering
his
steel
company
he
was
four
thousand
dollars
ahead
in
the
market
daisy
hair
was
light
brown
and
streaked
with
gray
her
eyes
were
grayish
blue
she
smiled
often
they
drank
and
then
ate
sandwiches
occasionally
pausing
in
their
conversation
to
watch
the
pacific
grow
dark
when
they
were
done
joe
walked
with
her
up
the
steps
and
into
the
lobby
i
love
the
moana
he
said
once
when
ingrid
and
max
and
i
were
on
vacation
maxie
disappeared
in
there
he
pointed
to
the
men
room
when
i
went
in
to
check
on
him
he
was
on
the
floor
pushing
his
toy
rifle
ahead
of
him
crawling
out
from
under
the
last
door
in
the
line
he
had
locked
them
all
from
the
inside
joe
laughed
stalling
what
did
you
do
she
asked
told
him
is
the
most
difficult
maneuver
let
get
out
of
here
i
do
think
i
ready
for
sex
daisy
said
quietly
it
overrated
joe
said
and
then
it
not
as
if
we
have
been
there
disappointment
hovered
how
about
a
back
rub
she
read
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
said
that
would
be
nice
oh
good
they
entered
the
elevator
relieved
to
be
still
together
he
took
off
his
shoes
in
her
room
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
daisy
slid
next
to
him
and
turned
on
her
side
he
rubbed
her
shoulders
and
upper
back
for
a
long
time
but
she
did
not
relax
he
reached
over
and
turned
out
the
light
she
said
nothing
he
continued
and
then
without
thinking
he
put
his
teeth
on
the
muscle
above
one
of
her
shoulder
blades
and
shook
her
slightly
she
winced
and
he
bit
harder
she
cried
out
and
spun
around
drawing
him
tightly
to
her
hold
me
she
said
hold
me
he
put
his
arms
around
her
as
she
began
to
shake
and
sob
she
beat
softly
on
his
back
with
her
fists
and
he
held
her
more
tightly
gradually
her
shaking
eased
and
she
breathed
more
evenly
without
speaking
they
undressed
and
lay
side
by
side
she
had
helped
him
once
in
a
similar
way
how
strange
he
thought
and
how
right
i
been
brave
she
said
i
bet
you
have
her
hand
moved
down
his
stomach
almost
as
an
afterthought
she
urged
him
over
on
top
of
her
and
guided
him
into
her
they
lay
complete
sometime
later
out
of
no
particular
necessity
he
began
to
move
slowly
in
and
out
it
was
better
than
talking
reassuring
i
am
right
here
he
was
saying
i
love
you
he
went
on
and
on
oh
she
cried
oh
oh
oh
her
head
fell
back
on
the
pillow
oh
and
then
joe
she
put
her
hands
on
his
buttocks
and
pulled
him
deeper
into
her
joe
he
gave
in
near
the
top
of
the
wave
that
picked
him
up
he
put
his
mouth
on
her
open
mouth
and
felt
her
calling
drawing
him
over
he
poured
into
her
tumbling
giving
her
everything
my
hero
daisy
said
she
was
leaning
on
one
elbow
and
looking
into
his
face
it
was
morning
nah
joe
said
i
thought
i
forgotten
how
no
way
he
said
waking
up
do
you
look
great
you
look
like
a
little
girl
i
got
a
favor
to
ask
she
said
i
want
to
remember
you
like
this
i
can
get
myself
to
the
airport
uh
when
will
i
see
you
again
joe
asked
i
going
home
through
france
she
said
you
know
i
have
a
studio
on
the
property
in
woodstock
woodstock
joe
groaned
maybe
you
like
to
spend
some
of
the
winter
out
here
they
were
too
experienced
to
let
the
future
spoil
the
moment
they
smooched
joe
took
a
shower
he
dressed
and
they
talked
for
a
few
minutes
before
he
hugged
her
goodbye
beautiful
he
said
goodbye
launcelot
lochinvar
he
started
toward
the
door
and
turned
back
a
step
toward
her
strider
he
said
strider
she
drawled
smiling
they
let
go
of
each
other
with
the
total
release
that
binds
across
any
space
or
time
joe
walked
along
kalakaua
avenue
it
was
still
early
most
of
the
tourists
were
in
bed
or
eating
breakfast
daisy
how
unexpected
how
great
he
was
going
to
live
in
her
studio
she
had
her
life
and
he
had
his
now
but
he
would
see
her
again
he
was
pretty
sure
of
that
what
was
between
them
was
real
and
had
remained
this
long
it
going
to
go
away
he
sang
scarlet
ribbons
several
times
and
was
good
and
hungry
by
the
time
he
reached
the
shopping
center
portuguese
sausage
coffee
ah
the
waitress
fiftyish
smiled
at
him
as
though
she
understood
perfectly
where
he
had
just
been
life
was
so
fine
in
fact
that
after
breakfast
he
put
off
going
home
and
wandered
over
to
fisherman
wharf
he
sat
with
his
feet
dangling
over
the
water
and
watched
a
man
fish
his
line
went
out
between
two
sampans
the
san
carlos
and
the
woniya
he
had
short
grizzled
hair
and
a
round
head
with
compact
asian
features
he
was
sitting
on
his
heels
motionless
he
could
have
been
or
a
small
cardboard
box
on
the
ground
next
to
him
was
neatly
packed
a
can
of
soda
a
knife
a
bag
that
probably
held
his
lunch
the
sound
of
traffic
on
ala
moana
was
muted
the
sun
was
full
but
not
yet
hot
the
straight
dark
fishing
line
met
the
end
of
its
reflection
wavering
on
the
green
harbor
water
he
fished
in
silence
for
nearly
an
hour
joe
finally
stood
up
and
stretched
three
days
now
not
biting
the
man
said
you
get
huh
joe
said
and
watched
him
turn
back
toward
his
line
he
would
never
give
up
the
image
of
his
bony
head
his
quiet
eyes
on
the
water
stayed
with
joe
he
wrote
it
down
when
he
got
home
and
in
the
morning
after
he
ate
a
bowl
of
cereal
he
crossed
out
words
and
added
a
few
holding
the
fisherman
in
front
of
him
while
he
was
imagining
the
fisherman
the
aging
bus
boy
appeared
with
his
cart
alphonse
jumped
off
his
fork
lift
whistling
ed
swaney
walked
over
sweating
jade
willow
lady
turned
toward
him
from
the
grill
the
bottle
saint
kneeled
they
watched
him
with
interest
and
concern
my
teachers
he
realized
with
a
rush
of
feeling
my
teachers
all
this
time
and
i
did
know
he
heard
a
noise
at
the
door
never
mind
batman
i
get
it
but
no
one
was
there
not
even
a
baby
in
a
basket
the
morning
air
was
vibrant
doves
called
his
teachers
and
so
many
before
him
had
done
their
best
he
bent
his
head
aloha
joe
burke
said
and
took
his
stand
beside
them
every
story
is
a
love
story
a
red
mg
came
racketing
around
the
corner
it
passed
stopped
and
reversed
one
front
fender
swinging
freely
where
you
going
the
driver
had
wild
eyes
and
a
two
day
growth
woodstock
get
in

patrick
lowered
himself
into
the
small
seat
holding
his
awol
bag
on
his
lap
whisky
in
the
jar
the
driver
sang
to
himself
shifting
through
gears
musharingumgoogee
wak
for
the
he
turned
and
shouted
over
the
engine
where
you
coming
from
wiesbaden
germany

patrick
shouted
back
wak
for
the
good
beer
the
krauts
they
flew
off
bumps
and
jolted
around
curves
for
five
or
six
miles
conversation
was
impossible
they
passed
a
golf
course
rolling
and
open
before
a
dark
wall
of
mountain
then
climbed
a
hill
by
three
gas
stations
woodstock
the
driver
shouted
stopping
at
a
narrow
triangular
green
thanks
for
the
ride
the
sound
of
the
mg
diminished
in
the
distance
as
patrick
looked
around
at
trees
a
neatly
painted
white
church
and
a
row
of
stores
he
walked
in
the
direction
that
the
mg
had
gone
until
he
reached
a
field
about
a
mile
from
the
green
he
turned
back
and
stopped
at
a
house
that
had
a
large
porch
and
a
sign
announcing
rooms
an
older
woman
answered
his
ring
her
hair
was
white
elaborately
piled
above
her
head
i
like
to
rent
a
room
if
you
have
any
vacancies
hmmph
she
was
shorter
than
patrick
but
seemed
to
be
looking
down
at
him
this
is
a
quiet
house
yes
no
smoking
yes
she
opened
the
door
and
showed
him
a
corner
room
with
a
matching
bed
and
bureau
and
a
small
rocking
chair
bathroom
down
the
hall
he
paid
for
a
week
and
signed
the
guest
register
yes
she
handed
him
two
keys
i
lock
the
front
door
after
dark
patrick
nodded
and
retreated
to
the
room
he
unpacked
his
clothes
and
a
paperback
copy
of
the
origin
of
species
which
he
placed
on
the
bedside
table
he
lay
on
the
bed
a
few
minutes
adjusting
to
his
new
home
then
left
closing
the
door
silently
behind
him
in
town
he
decided
to
try
the
cafe
espresso
he
walked
down
wide
stone
steps
crossed
a
patio
and
entered
an
open
door
two
people
at
the
end
of
a
small
bar
leaned
towards
each
other
laughing
and
talking
in
lowered
tones
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
a
young
man
was
practicing
on
an
upright
piano
patrick
sat
at
a
window
table
and
waited
until
a
tall
woman
emerged
from
the
kitchen
she
wore
bead
necklaces
a
tight
gray
jersey
and
a
wrap
around
red
and
orange
indian
print
skirt
a
thick
blonde
braid
hung
to
her
waist
patrick
ordered
rice
and
vegetables
and
watched
her
hips
move
to
a
gentle
repeating
melody
from
the
piano
the
player
varied
the
tempo
and
the
emphasis
working
further
into
the
piece
exploring
its
edges
without
losing
its
rhythmic
heart
a
man
in
his
thirties
with
a
round
face
and
curly
hair
came
in
and
sat
at
the
next
table
he
placed
black
and
white
stones
on
a
go
board
studying
each
move
that
is
go
is
it
i
read
about
it
patrick
offered
go
is
an
ancient
japanese
game
the
player
said
without
looking
up
it
requires
intelligence
and
concentration
that
leaves
me
out
patrick
said
the
couple
at
the
bar
walked
out
as
the
woman
passed
through
the
door
she
looked
back
at
patrick
and
smiled
her
eyes
were
gray
her
shoulders
her
weight
evenly
balanced
she
was
about
his
age
he
smiled
back
surprised
women
did
usually
pay
attention
to
patrick
he
was
compact
medium
sized
he
had
hair
and
a
square
face
with
high
cheekbones
and
traces
of
freckles
his
blue
eyes
were
set
deeply
behind
thick
eyebrows
he
had
been
called
cute
a
couple
of
times
mostly
he
got
sympathetic
smiles
as
women
pushed
past
him
going
for
the
tall
dark
and
handsomes
or
the
ones
with
money
or
the
major
losers
it
was
a
mystery
to
him
how
people
got
coupled
up
my
name
is
eve
the
waitress
said
in
a
luxurious
voice
as
she
bent
forward
with
his
plate
she
had
goddess
breasts
and
smelled
of
patchouli
i
patrick
he
said
and
choked
king
of
repartee
he
added
regaining
his
voice
she
smiled
as
if
she
had
known
him
deeply
in
another
life
and
then
she
swayed
away
into
the
kitchen
the
go
player
remained
immersed
in
study
an
air
of
relief
emanating
from
his
face
perhaps
he
was
recovering
from
the
attentions
of
dark
beauties
with
trust
funds
do
be
jealous
patrick
told
himself
when
the
gods
want
a
good
laugh
they
give
you
what
you
want
try
me
another
voice
in
him
said
long
dark
hair
he
ate
dinner
and
began
to
confront
the
next
problem
he
had
a
few
travelers
checks
in
reserve
but
he
always
found
work
before
he
had
to
cash
them

had
paid
for
his
own
flight
back
to
wiesbaden
come

patrick
checked
around
the
cafe
for
a
pay
phone
wondering
whether
there
was
a
listing
for
his
father
friend
no
phone
on
his
way
out
of
the
cafe
he
changed
his
mind
and
ordered
a
beer
at
the
bar
the
room
was
filling
a
van
morrison
album
had
replaced
the
piano
player
attractive
women
crowded
around
guys
who
wore
hammer
hooks
and
stanley
tapes
like
jewelry
on
their
belts
totems
of
a
better
way
feels
good
to

up
he
said
to
the
guy
next
to
him

happening

hey
parker

a
heavyset
fellow

over
he
had
a
pleasant
ironic
expression
for
what
there
were
white
paint
stains
on
his
blue
shirt
says
he
looking
for
work
patrick
patrick
extended
his
hand
parker
ives
he
looked
patrick
over
as
they
shook
hands
ladders
patrick
wasps
he
said

patrick
asked

yes
parker
drained
the
glass
of
beer
he
was
holding
tomorrow
he
put
his
glass
on
the
bar
and
left
parker
all
right
my
name
is
claude
by
the
way
aieee
claude
a
thin
blonde
with
green
eye
shadow
and
exaggerated
cherry
red
lipstick
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
excuse
me
patrick
two
young
women
entered
and
came
over
to
the
bar
one
of
them
bent
over
removed
a
sandal
and
shook
it
she
had
waist
length
dark
brown
hair
and
was
wearing
levi
and
a
blue
chambray
shirt
she
had
long
legs
and
long
arms
that
made
interesting
angles
out
from
the
crouching
curve
of
her
hips
there
she
said
straightening
the
top
three
buttons
of
her
shirt
were
undone
sensitive
patrick
thought
her
eyes
were
unusually
clear
light
hazel
with
flecks
of
gray
and
green
her
blonde
friend
was
shorter
narrow
waisted
and
well
built
the
blonde
caught
him
looking
patrick
reddening
thought
he
saw
a
flash
of
understanding
she
was
a
thinker
might
even
have
read
a
book
lately
in
patrick
second
year
at
florida
state
a
biology
professor
named
ted
williams
had
turned
him
on
to
science
patrick
was
an
army
brat
he
had
lived
in
florida
the
philippines
panama
and
germany
he
spoke
passable
spanish
and
german
his
parents
were
readers
patrick
had
been
around
books
all
his
life
and
felt
as
though
he
were
ahead
of
the
other
students
once
he
found
a
direction
that
he
wanted
to
learn
more
about
science
he
decided
to
go
right
at
it
he
did
have
to
be
a
university
student
to
read
the
books
it
would
be
cheaper
and
besides
people
were
on
the
move
work
was
easy
to
come
by
his
father
raised
in
the
depression
and
caught
up
in
world
war
ii
had
stayed
in
the
army
never
underestimate
the
importance
of
a
good
billet
he
had
told
patrick
more
than
once
an
edict
laid
on
him
by
sergeant
donald
a
mythic
presence
from
the
days
before
officer
candidate
school
patrick
father
never
tired
of
quoting
sergeant
donald
as
they
moved
from
base
to
base
his
parents
were
patient
and
generally
good
humored
about
military
life
they
escaped
into
books
when
patrick
announced
that
he
was
dropping
out
his
father
seemed
to
think
it
was
fine
do
burn
any
bridges
pat
you
can
go
back
to
school
later
if
you
want
or
come
work
with
me
his
father
was
about
to
retire
from
the
army
and
was
planning
to
settle
in
florida
and
work
for
himself
as
a
handyman
when
his
father
was
reading
he
enjoyed
fixing
things
he
looked
forward
to
becoming
a
sort
of
major
to
the
rescue
the
tools
the
truck
the
little
boxes
of
washers
and
screws
and
finishing
nails
the
retirement
checks
punctually
in
the
mail
patrick
mother
fussed
about
patrick
eating
habits
but
she
really
worried
patrick
sister
molly
had
earned
a
commercial
pilot
license
before
she
settled
down
in
atlanta
to
teach
english
married
to
a
hard
working
good
old
boy
patrick
his
mother
felt
would
find
his
own
way
if
he
ate
right
and
got
enough
sleep
both
parents
suggested
books
for
his
reading
list
patrick
was
well
along
in
the
list
when
he
finished
books
he
mailed
them
to
molly
for
safekeeping
building
the
library
he
would
tell
himself
as
he
doled
out
postage
money
another
few
days
and
he
would
send
the
darwin
he
was
still
looking
at
the
blonde
she
smiled
slightly
and
he
said
i
patrick
amber
she
said

friend

nodded
at
them

and
moved
a
step

said

laughed

month
willow
said
in
a
low
voice
there
was
a
brief
drop
in
the
noise
level
as
the
piano
player
crossed
the
room
with
quick
steps
and
went
out
the
door

to

added
for
patrick

full
day

willow
lifted
one
hand
amber
patrick
said
to
himself
walking
back
to
his
room
frieda
had
gone
to
bed
with
him
a
couple
of
times
during
his
last
summer
in
germany
he
gotten
lucky
once
at
a
party
in
tallahassee
that
was
it
no
one
like
amber
his
eyes
opened
wider
as
he
remembered
her
he
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
imagining
the
warm
solid
body
under
her
white
blouse
his
mind
spun
out
and
he
cleared
his
throat
he
shook
his
head
got
control
of
himself
and
walked
faster
a
man
playing
a
blues
harp
passed
him
on
the
other
side
of
tinker
street
the
blues
pulsed
up
into
the
evening
sky
mournful
and
elaborate
a
peacock
tail
of
sound
feelings
stirred
for
which
patrick
had
no
words
he
pumped
one
fist
in
the
air
like
a
brother
and
turned
aside
to
the
rooming
house
he
likes
you
as
usual
willow
said
and
of
course
you
do
care
you
are
such
a
bitch
sometimes
i
am
not
i
ca
help
it
if
he
likes
me
amber
made
a
tiny
swaggering
move
with
her
breasts
anyway
he
likes
you
just
as
much
well
why
does
he
look
at
me
if
you
wear
something
besides
jeans
and
work
shirts
pants
and
short
skirts
clung
to
perfect
legs
her
blouses
were
tight
she
was
averagely
good
looking
her
face
was
open
and
energetic
her
hair
was
chestnut
tending
to
blonde
shoulder
length
and
wavy
men
found
themselves
looking
at
her
talking
to
her
and
then
the
more
they
looked
the
more
they
saw
she
was
faster
than
they
were
she
adjusted
effortlessly
in
flight
becoming
more
serious
or
more
carefree
more
cerebral
or
more
passionate
under
their
gaze
men
are
so
stupid
willow
said
do
you
think
they
cute
sometimes
even
ahnree
with
his
tan
and
those
big
white
towels
he
wraps
around
his
belly
at
the
pool
old
god
do
you
think
he
fifty
but
he
has
those
big
round
dark
eyes
ahnree
had
picked
up
amber
the
second
day
they
were
in
town
when
i
see
someone
so
special
i
know
i
must
paint
you
my
name
is
ahnree
he
had
said
with
great
dignity
ahnree
willow
asked
as
in
matisse
he
said
it
is
an
honor
such
a
name
a
curse
but
never
mind
he
smiled
gallantly
gigi
willow
said
to
herself
no
one
should
copy
maurice
chevalier
they
get
the
eyes
and
the
teeth
but
they
do
have
the
engine
no
fire
engine
inside
the
doors
no
fire
engine
she
said
to
amber
huh
ahnree
had
said
something
to
amber
and
amber
was
asking
why
they
should
try
living
in
his
studio
you
will
find
it
most
private
ahnree
said
it
is
some
distance
from
the
main
house
in
return
a
bit
of
modeling
say
once
a
week
say
you
will
he
pleaded
only
if
it
is
all
right
with
willow
amber
said
kicking
willow
in
the
ankle
ah
willow
ahnree
said
wrenching
his
eyes
from
amber
who
was
becoming
ever
more
elusive
more
of
a
muse
where
is
this
place
willow
asked
a
short
drive
up
the
mountain
an
easy
ride
on
a
bicycle
in
fact
i
have
several
bicycles
if
you
do
mind
the
old
fashioned
kind
with
baskets
on
the
handlebars
and
what
do
i
have
to
do
amber
kicked
her
again
ahnree
considered
you
may
mow
the
lawn
around
the
studio
and
if
you
wish
attend
a
little
to
the
flowers
willow
had
given
in
and
it
had
been
fine
ahnree
had
left
them
alone
and
amber
seemed
to
enjoy
modeling
it
not
so
bad
being
admired
she
told
willow
well
willow
said
coming
back
to
the
present
you
knocked
patrick
out
with
that
bit
about
foggy
mornings
on
the
galapagos
islands
can
i
help
it
if
my
father
is
a
darwin
freak
he
practically
made
me
go
with
him
christ
willow
said
he
likes
you
i
telling
you
amber
said
gee
maybe
he
let
me
hold
his
hand
someday
comfort
his
broken
heart
she
smiled
to
soften
the
edge
in
her
tone
and
they
pedaled
toward
home
in
the
early
evening
light
willow
liked
patrick
he
thought
for
himself
and
his
eyes
were
cute
a
penetrating
blue
that
changed
from
hard
to
soft
he
was
the
right
height
and
looked
strong
underneath
that
funny
european
work
shirt
her
imagination
slowed
at
his
belt
she
had
shared
sleeping
bags
with
aaron
at
a
but
it
had
been
dark
it
had
been
pleasant
enough
i
mean
she
wrote
in
her
journal
but
men
bodies
were
basically
terra
incognita
what
she
knew
of
sex
was
a
fuzzy
blend
of
michelangelo
and
the
diaries
of
anais
nin
there
were
plenty
of
men
around
it
was
that
it
was
just
that
none
of
them
turned
her
on
she
tired
of
their
talk
and
endless
competition
she
rather
listen
to
the
beethoven
quartets
that
was
another
thing
about
patrick
what
did
he
say
rattled
his
cage
that
was
it
exactly
her
perfect
brother
david
said
he
liked
beethoven
david
always
said
what
he
was
supposed
to
but
he
never
listened
to
beethoven
he
liked
the
beatles
for
sake
i
mean
yes
they
wrote
some
catchy
melodies
but
really
they
were
a
long
way
from
dylan
let
alone
beethoven
willow
indignation
carried
her
to
the
top
of
the
last
hill
before
ahnree
driveway
she
got
off
her
bike
and
waited
for
amber
they
walked
up
the
bumpy
dirt
road
one
on
each
side
of
the
grass
strip
in
the
middle
as
they
passed
the
main
house
they
got
on
their
bikes
and
pedaled
to
the
studio
along
the
edge
of
a
small
steep
hay
field
rich
in
clover
and
wildflowers
surrounded
by
trees
the
studio
was
made
of
dark
weathered
wood
it
had
a
deep
glow
to
willow
perhaps
because
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
lived
anywhere
other
than
home
or
the
university
she
slept
on
a
screened
porch
that
looked
into
the
woods
behind
the
house
amber
had
the
bedroom
the
central
room
had
a
cathedral
ceiling
and
a
skylight
that
faced
north
it
was
furnished
with
an
old
couch
a
coffee
table
and
two
armchairs
drawn
up
by
a
stone
fireplace
they
ate
at
a
large
table
in
the
kitchen
the
room
through
which
one
entered
the
house
ahnree
explained
to
amber
that
skylights
faced
north
so
that
the
light
for
painting
would
be
more
even
the
changes
more
gradual
painters
had
been
settling
in
woodstock
for
generations
there
were
many
such
houses
hard
to
keep
warm
in
the
winter
but
ahnree
pointed
out
with
a
shrug
if
one
is
in
san
miguel
mexico
right
willow
asked
amber
right
i
guess
he
goes
there
every
winter
amber
had
spent
her
time
meeting
people
and
going
to
parties
she
already
had
one
guy
chasing
her
showing
up
unannounced
and
hanging
around
willow
usually
excused
herself
and
read
on
her
bed
an
outside
door
led
to
the
porch
the
door
was
solid
and
blocked
most
of
the
noise
from
inside
the
house
when
she
was
reading
she
took
walks
and
rode
her
bike
into
town
for
groceries
she
was
learning
to
cook
you
would
have
killed
a
robin
if
you
hit
it
with
her
first
loaf
of
seven
grain
bread
but
she
was
getting
the
hang
of
it
she
had
developed
a
wicked
lasagna
mornings
after
the
lasagna
pan
was
as
empty
as
the
chianti
bottle
or
bottles
on
this
particular
evening
she
threw
a
salad
together
avocado
feta
cheese
a
few
scallions
red
leaf
lettuce
lemon
juice
and
a
yummy
portuguese
olive
oil
that
had
recommended
ann
was
middle
aged
with
a
red
face
and
a
bad
leg
she
sat
behind
the
cash
register
talking
loudly
with
customers
denouncing
the
government
and
its
stupid
war
she
liked
young
people
and
extended
credit
when
they
were
short
of
money
she
had
a
metal
box
with
cards
in
it
alphabetized
by
name
willow
watched
her
accept
payments
and
cross
out
numbers
at
the
bottom
of
little
columns
while
customers
waited
proudly
with
bags
containing
cigarettes
potato
chips
and
quarts
of
milk
if
someone
was
charging
he
usually
a
he
would
mumble
thanks
and
pick
his
way
out
guiltily
while
ann
added
another
number
to
his
column
i
got
to
get
a
job
soon
willow
said
taking
another
bite
of
salad
what
for
amber
father
made
a
deposit
every
month
to
her
account
while
you
in
school
he
told
her
i
want
to
i
mean
i
do
want
to
keep
living
on
your
money
it
not
my
money
i
did
earn
it
yeah
but
they
had
taken
a
bus
to
sacramento
and
caught
a
train
east
the
day
after
finals
the
idea
swept
them
off
their
feet
they
were
just
now
a
month
later
realizing
that
they
were
actually
somewhere
else
after
a
day
of
walking
around
the
village
in
new
york
they
took
a
bus
to
woodstock
they
got
out
in
front
of
the
news
shop
and
here
they
were
their
parents
were
thrilled
but
amber
convinced
her
father
on
the
phone
that
she
was
having
a
good
time
and
was
in
control
of
herself
willow
resorted
to
a
stream
of
postcards
maple
trees
in
october
scenes
of
the
ashokan
reservoir
and
one
of
the
tiny
old
catholic
church
peeping
out
of
the
trees
father
francis
built
it
himself
with
the
help
of
his
boys
i
mean
acolytes
she
wrote
a
kindly
old
fraud
who
presides
over
his
two
acres
with
tottering
good
humor
dispensing
advice
and
tea
to
wanderers
amber
and
i
went
to
a
wedding
there
last
week
lots
of
flowers
lousy
cake
it
halfway
up
a
mountain
called
love
willow
what
would
you
do
amber
asked
i
do
know
i
do
think
i
waitress
material
i
mean
god
i
wish
i
were
i
like
food
but
i
too
dreamy
i
mean
i
want
to
do
something
well
you
do
want
to
work
at
night
anyway
amber
said
no
when
it
got
dark
willow
would
just
as
soon
go
to
bed
with
a
book
she
was
an
early
riser
go
with
the
flow
amber
said
something
will
turn
up
i
guess
willow
collected
the
dishes
washed
them
and
went
out
to
the
porch
to
her
comfortable
bed
a
warm
safe
cave
she
undressed
and
snuggled
into
her
pillows
darwin
she
thought
she
imagined
patrick
aboard
beagle
your
muffin
sir
she
presented
him
with
a
gorgeous
cinnamon
apple
muffin
on
a
tin
plate
aye
aye
someone
said
as
she
fell
asleep
in
the
morning
she
went
for
a
walk
gathered
wildflowers
for
the
kitchen
table
and
mixed
a
batch
of
bread
placing
it
to
rise
in
the
sun
covered
with
a
dishcloth
she
made
coffee
and
ate
a
bagel
amber
appeared
yawning
and
rubbing
her
eyes
she
poured
herself
a
cup
of
coffee
and
they
discussed
the
day
possibilities
art
wanted
amber
to
help
him
prepare
a
barnwarming
party
he
had
just
bought
a
barn
that
he
planned
to
make
into
a
house
willow
was
invited
art
was
considerate
and
rather
handsome
willow
conceded
but
she
thought
she
stay
home
how
are
you
going
to
meet
people
that
way
amber
asked
i
already
meeting
people
she
said
i
bored
with
people
amber
shook
her
head
do
you
think
i
ought
to
let
my
hair
get
longer
this
coffee
is
so
good
long
hair
is
a
pain
willow
said
dismissively
although
she
was
proud
of
hers
and
brushed
it
thoroughly
every
day
with
your
body
who
needs
distraction
i
do
know
i
look
so
conventional
this
was
dangerous
territory
amber
was
in
fact
conventional
she
was
a
little
wild
maybe
but
she
was
on
the
pill
and
she
did
get
attached
for
long
she
kept
her
options
open
her
grades
were
surprisingly
good
willow
own
record
at
stanford
was
ordinary
the
courses
were
all
so
canned
just
right
for
her
perfect
brother
who
was
a
year
behind
her
and
practically
in
law
school
already
willow
did
the
minimum
but
she
was
into
it
there
had
to
be
more
to
life
than
the
accepted
opinion
about
george
eliot
christ
you
were
lucky
if
you
got
to
read
james
joyce
never
mind
henry
miller
willow
adored
henry
miller
all
right
i
am
conventional
amber
said
breaking
into
reverie
and
i
going
to
have
a
damned
good
time
while
i
at
it
willow
poured
the
last
of
the
coffee
into
their
cups
amber
really
awake
willow
knew
at
ten
or
eleven
her
eyes
would
open
the
rest
of
the
way
slightly
startled
slightly
pleased
to
have
survived
the
transition
amber
eyes
were
a
dark
mediterranean
brown
if
i
were
gay
willow
thought
i
could
go
for
amber
she
so
fierce
underneath
that
easy
chameleon
surface
she
knows
what
she
wants
and
she
gets
it
amber
stretched
and
went
back
into
her
room
emerging
when
art
honked
the
horn
in
his
pickup
willow
waved
at
art
and
watched
amber
skip
into
the
truck
elaborately
casual
a
barnwarmer
dream
willow
punched
down
the
bread
and
left
it
to
rise
again
amber
would
get
fucked
tonight
she
thought
or
not
but
she
have
the
choice
willow
washed
the
few
dishes
and
dried
them
as
she
tried
to
think
about
sex
it
was
becoming
a
more
persistent
question
or
urge
or
need
these
days
she
wandered
out
to
the
porch
kicked
off
her
sandals
and
lay
on
the
bed
she
imagined
art
standing
by
the
door
he
melted
down
and
changed
into
patrick
oh
to
hell
with
it
she
said
and
took
off
her
pants
she
ran
her
fingers
lightly
back
and
forth
between
her
legs
while
patrick
watched
she
drew
up
her
knees
she
let
them
fall
open
what
are
you
looking
at
she
teased
patrick
in
a
low
voice
i
a
romantic
he
said
earnestly
well
if
you
a
romantic
why
are
you
naked
with
a
rose
in
your
teeth
patrick
left
as
she
continued
to
play
with
herself
in
a
moment
he
was
back
naked
a
long
stemmed
red
rose
held
carefully
between
his
teeth
he
was
nicely
muscled
with
a
flat
stomach
she
motioned
him
closer
with
one
hand
he
approached
slowly
and
she
held
out
her
hand
for
the
rose
he
gave
it
to
her
good
patrick
she
said
and
struck
him
lightly
across
the
stomach
thorns
left
three
tiny
drops
of
blood
he
gasped
and
drew
in
his
stomach
his
eyes
opened
wider
and
softened
what
do
you
want
she
asked
to
please
you
she
looked
at
the
rose
weighed
it
in
her
hand
to
get
the
feel
of
it
and
looked
back
at
patrick
he
did
not
run
away
he
was
willing
to
suffer
for
her
his
mouth
was
slightly
open
and
he
had
a
large
erection
she
indicated
the
end
of
the
bed
with
the
rose
and
slid
down
pulling
a
pillow
with
her
for
her
head
patrick
moved
around
in
front
of
her
she
pointed
at
the
flagstones
of
the
porch
floor
so
please
me
he
got
on
his
knees
and
she
placed
her
heels
on
his
back
willow
knees
were
slowly
opening
and
closing
as
she
rubbed
harder
her
long
slim
back
arched
patrick
ahhh
she
cried
softly
ahhhhhhh
ahhhh
ahhh
her
feet
slid
out
and
her
legs
collapsed
on
the
bed
she
was
warm
and
wet
and
out
of
breath
she
opened
her
eyes
the
air
was
bright
almost
vivid
patrick
had
disappeared
she
would
reward
him
another
time
laundry
she
thought
cheerfully
a
crow
called
twice
she
rolled
over
on
her
side
and
watched
a
squirrel
jump
onto
the
trunk
of
a
maple
and
wait
tail
curled
listening
squirrelie
she
said
yes
she
sat
up
swinging
her
feet
down
to
the
cool
flagstones
yes
she
said
shower
squirrelie
ran
up
the
tree
out
of
view
willow
made
a
pile
of
clothes
on
the
cotton
coverlet
and
took
the
bundle
to
the
washing
machine
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
she
pulled
off
her
and
walked
into
the
bathroom
where
she
regarded
herself
in
the
mirror
before
getting
into
the
shower
her
breasts
were
too
small
she
thought
as
hot
water
ran
deliciously
down
her
back
but
they
were
pretty
her
long
waist
and
long
legs
gave
her
body
a
flowing
athletic
line
i
do
have
an
adequate
ass
she
said
to
herself
soaping
it
she
was
continually
unsure
as
to
whether
she
should
throw
it
around
or
wait
until
the
right
one
discovered
it
for
himself
you
are
so
beautiful
the
right
one
said
unable
to
lift
his
eyes
she
swayed
modestly
i
have
these
three
tasks
she
said
and
burst
out
laughing
in
the
shower
the
bread
god
she
washed
her
hair
and
went
on
with
the
day
amber
returned
and
was
unable
to
convince
her
to
go
to
the
party
shortly
after
amber
left
willow
considered
the
house
clean
her
hair
brushed
and
the
rest
of
the
day
free
she
put
a
paperback
copy
of
sur
and
the
oranges
of
hieronymus
in
her
bag
and
rode
out
past
ahnree
he
was
drinking
something
by
the
pool
accompanied
by
a
placid
looking
blonde
in
her
forties
willow
waved
and
then
bumped
down
to
the
blacktop
road
where
she
picked
up
speed
and
breezed
downhill
into
town
her
hair
fluttering
nicely
behind
her
she
was
early
enough
to
get
a
table
on
the
patio
in
front
of
the
depresso
she
ordered
a
cup
of
coffee
and
read
her
book
looking
up
now
and
then
to
watch
the
regulars
gather
and
the
tourists
walk
uncomfortably
back
and
forth
her
porch
the
clean
house
and
the
baked
bread
were
satisfyingly
present
what
are
you
reading
god
patrick
was
standing
a
few
feet
away
she
held
the
book
so
that
he
could
read
the
cover
i
come
for
my
reward
he
said
she
dropped
the
book
a
cold
one
after
a
day
of
scraping
paint
he
continued
reaching
down
and
handing
her
the
book
henry
miller
i
heard
he
was
good
yes
willow
said
recovering
well
do
let
me
keep
you
from
your
reward
you
deserve
it
right
patrick
said
uncertainly
willow
right
she
nodded
where
amber
she
at
a
barnwarming
party
breaking
hearts
this
was
definitely
disloyal
aha
patrick
said
talk
to
you
later
willow
smiled
and
went
back
to
her
book
i
hate
him
she
thought
amber
too
she
drank
the
rest
of
her
coffee
time
to
leave
but
she
could
bring
herself
to
get
on
her
bike
and
pedal
home
she
went
inside
and
ordered
a
beer
at
the
bar
patrick
was
in
deep
conversation
with
a
rugged
good
looking
regular
named
wendell
they
seemed
to
be
talking
about
chisels
jesus
bob
dylan
was
sitting
with
bernard
and
marylou
the
owners
at
a
round
table
near
the
kitchen
door
they
were
laughing
loudly
bernard
has
a
handsome
mustache
willow
thought
dylan
looked
like
he
was
winding
up
for
an
intense
night
he
was
so
intuitive
he
always
caught
her
looking
and
usually
ignored
her
once
he
gave
her
a
quick
little
shake
of
his
head
it
a
fucked
up
world
we
got
ta
do
something
he
seemed
to
be
saying
he
was
on
the
edge
of
control
major
chutzpah
willow
could
get
her
father
to
understand
dylan
her
father
was
a
brahms
expert
how
could
he
a
generational
difference
he
suggested
willow
had
snorted
angry
with
him
for
evading
the
argument
far
be
it
from
me
to
suggest
that
he
is
a
nihilist
simultaneously
outdated
and
immature
not
to
mention
noisy
her
father
continued
well
at
least
he
was
treating
her
like
a
child
he
is
writing
american
masterpieces
she
said
god
help
us
her
father
was
grinning
and
they
left
it
at
that
claude
came
in
and
gave
her
his
big
smile
and
automatic
wink
he
was
handsome
and
could
get
away
with
anything
she
thought
damn
him
but
she
had
to
admit
that
she
liked
him
i
mean
he
liked
himself
everyone
in
the
place
liked
him
how
could
she
not
claude
began
talking
to
sue
a
painter
who
was
usually
with
a
sad
charmer
named
jim
as
she
was
thinking
about
jim
he
came
through
the
door
he
and
sue
exchanged
smiles
and
private
greetings
but
they
did
not
hug
he
seemed
more
interested
in
getting
a
drink
as
fast
as
he
could
problems
willow
thought
wendell
introduced
patrick
to
a
guy
named
joe
the
three
sat
at
a
table
and
began
talking
about
the
war
patrick
waved
willow
over
you
know
willow
he
asked
the
others
seen
you
around
wendell
said
joe
nodded
he
had
looked
willow
over
on
previous
occasions
in
the
depresso
he
was
tall
and
alert
in
his
he
had
dark
hair
blue
eyes
and
a
mustache
they
had
never
spoken
but
willow
had
the
feeling
that
he
knew
more
about
her
than
she
did
about
him
what
do
you
think
about
vietnam
patrick
asked
willow
as
she
sat
down
they
waited
while
she
considered
i
think
we
ought
to
take
care
of
our
own

a
gap
between

along
the
bar

was
beginning
to
feel
at
home
in
the
depresso
amber
had
come
in
twice
during
the
week
once
with
willow
and
once
with
a
builder
named
art
she
had
smiled
at
patrick
but
she
was
available
although
her
smile
seemed
to
indicate
that
any
day
she
might
be
i
on
her
list
patrick
thought
smiling
back
he
finished
the
darwin
book
and
started
introduction
to
by
alfred
north
whitehead
one
evening
in
the
depresso
sue
came
over
to
his
table
and
asked
what
he
was
reading
listen
to
this
he
said
operations
of
thought
are
like
cavalry
charges
in
battle
they
are
strictly
limited
in
number
they
require
fresh
horses
they
must
be
made
only
at
decisive
moments
sue
wrinkled
her
nose
too
much
she
sat
down
i
mean
this
book
is
a
classic
what
is
math
anyway
right
here
patrick
said

the
cover

from

sue
giggled

he

pile
of
books
and
a
lies
on
the
couch
and
reads
all
day
she
looked
around
and
sighed
later
patrick
she
left
relaxed
and
alert
like
a
fox
on
the
move
the
next
night
she
sat
at
his
table
again
it
hot
she
said

a
beer

i
get
thirsty
staring
at
white
all
day
patrick
said

patrick
surprised
himself
where
i
know
a
place
i
do
have
a
car
i
got
my
roommate
for
the
night
when
they
got
into
the
car
sue
twisted
and
reached
past
patrick
to
arrange
something
on
the
back
seat
behind
him
she
was
sweating
slightly
and
he
was
astonished
by
her
sweet
rich
smell
strange
he
said
we
got
the
same
smell
how
can
that
be
same
genes
i
mostly
irish
what
are
you
half
polish
half
ojibwa
she
said
she
drove
to
shady
and
followed
the
sawkill
creek
to
a
spot
where
she
could
pull
off
the
road
she
led
patrick
through
trees
and
down
a
steep
path
to
the
stream
it
was
nearly
dark
as
they
walked
over
rocks
to
a
bend
where
a
deeper
pool
curved
along
the
outer
bank
sue
crossed
below
the
pool
to
a
shingle
of
rocks
and
boulders
and
kicked
off
her
sandals
here
she
said
patrick
noticed
the
orange
glow
of
cigarettes
on
the
opposite
bank
but
he
could
see
the
faces
behind
them
he
forgot
about
them
when
sue
pulled
her
up
over
her
head
and
stepped
out
of
her
jeans
and
underwear
patrick
her
body
was
compact
and
tanned
one
curve
flowed
naturally
into
the
next
he
stripped
awkwardly
thinking
that
there
was
a
first
time
for
everything
and
followed
her
into
the
icy
water
she
swam
up
and
down
diving
and
surfacing
blowing
water
black
hair
sleek
behind
her
ears
patrick
did
a
few
somersaults
and
floated
feeling
the
heat
of
the
day
drain
out
of
his
body
oooh
she
said
walking
out
of
the
water
and
onto
the
rocks
build
a
fire
they
broke
dead
branches
took
a
few
pages
from
patrick
pocket
notebook
and
started
the
fire
with
her
lighter
patrick
stood
in
front
of
the
small
blaze
sue
sat
on
her
jeans
her
knees
drawn
up
to
her
breasts
hey
turd
face
where
come
from
under
a
fucking
rock
patrick
spun
around
he
saw
a
white
face
in
the
dark
a
man
standing
behind
a
low
line
of
boulders
fifteen
feet
away
fucking
idiot
the
voice
was
twisted
nearly
screaming
his
eyes
were
distorted
he
was
beefy
too
big
to
mess
with
fucking
queer
he
took
a
step
forward
patrick
became
oddly
calm
there
was
a
rock
by
his
ankle
the
size
of
a
grapefruit
he
slowly
flexed
his
knees
and
looked
into
the
man
eyes
scoop
the
rock
and
smash
his
face
one
motion
the
man
yelled
again
patrick
held
his
eyes
time
slowed
a
stick
snapped
behind
patrick
and
the
hair
rose
on
the
back
of
his
neck
sue
had
moved
he
was
trapped
he
did
dare
turn
his
head
let
get
the
hell
out
of
here
a
voice
said
behind
him
fuck
him
let
get
out
of
here
go
get
a
beer
he
an
asshole
yeah
fuck
him
let
go
get
a
beer
the
white
face
hesitated
and
turned
away
the
two
crashed
through
the
woods
swearing
and
shouting
patrick
put
his
clothes
on
as
fast
as
he
could
i
was
going
to
kill
him
he
said
in
shock
i
mean
i
knew
how
it
was
already
in
me
sue
smiled
get
dressed
sue
what
if
they
come
back
she
got
to
her
feet
and
stood
naked
on
the
rocks
as
though
she
were
in
her
bedroom
firelight
flickering
up
her
body
he
put
out
the
fire
while
she
dressed
his
heart
was
still
pounding
as
they
climbed
up
the
bank
and
walked
quickly
to
the
car
did
you
see
the
other
guy
he
was
in
the
dark
sue
said
i
could
see
him
he
sounded
local
patrick
said
he
saved
the
scene
that
guy
was
flipped
out
gone
sounded
like
he
was
from
north
carolina
or
some
place
down
there
he
was
gone
it
was
a
relief
to
be
on
the
road
i
need
a
beer
he
said
when
they
reached
town
patrick
see
you
sue
said
stopping
in
front
of
the
depresso
he
paused
you
are
really
beautiful
she
made
a
wry
smile
that
said
i
already
know
that
night
patrick
the
next
day
during
coffee
break
he
told
wilson
what
had
happened
chicks
wilson
said
i
never
knew
i
could
kill
somebody
patrick
said
i
mean
i
not
the
violent
type
but
it
was
all
inside
me
like
it
was
or
something
i
never
looked
at
that
rock
but
i
knew
it
was
there
wilson
sighed
knife
comes
in
handy
sometimes
he
said
patrick
took
a
folding
opinel
out
of
his
pocket
too
small
wilson
said
his
hand
brushed
the
black
handle
of
the
hunting
knife
he
wore
on
his
belt
bad
shit
he
said
he
stood
up
got
ta
put
the
paint
on
the
wall
patrick
that
night
sue
did
not
show
up
at
the
depresso
a
week
later
she
came
into
the
bar
with
jim
laughing
and
having
a
good
time
she
waved
at
patrick
like
an
old
friend
but
she
did
say
anything
to
him
he
felt
less
isolated
seeing
her
he
had
touched
her
but
he
knew
her
smell
and
what
she
looked
like
underneath
those
clothes
on
saturday
parker
invited
him
to
a
party
at
his
house
when
patrick
arrived
the
downstairs
was
full
of
people
talking
loudly
and
drinking
steadily
he
learned
that
parker
too
was
a
drop
out
from
harvard
and
that
the
mercedes
had
belonged
to
his
mother
you
know
patrick
said
to
him
after
a
few
beers
when
people
talk
i
get
the
feeling
i
missing
something
it
like
they
saying
one
thing
but
really
talking
about
something
else
it
like
there
another
layer
underneath
everything
you
learning
parker
said
desperation
crossed
his
face
he
looked
as
though
he
might
get
in
his
car
and
drive
away
forever
instead
he
smiled
helplessly
and
went
for
another
drink
patrick
met
wife
elaine
a
short
cheerful
woman
with
a
plain
face
and
an
extravagant
body
wilson
was
making
pronouncements
about
the
paintings
on
parker
walls
mentioning
painters
patrick
had
never
heard
of
parker
two
sons
were
running
about
having
a
great
time
parker
and
his
wife
hildy
were
both
stout
blondes
with
fair
complexions
and
blue
eyes
their
boys
were
stamped
from
the
same
mold
patrick
could
see
them
someday
hauling
ladders
driving
elegant
old
cars
and
charming
housewives
joe
burke
showed
up
and
introduced
patrick
to
his
lady
sally
daffodil
he
called
her
she
was
tall
and
athletic
with
a
grace
and
coloring
that
was
like
the
flower
they
were
a
good
pair
patrick
thought
funny
and
open
yet
he
sensed
reserves
in
them
that
ran
deep
patrick
was
used
to
the
company
of
so
many
sharp
people
in
one
room
gino
canzoni
came
in
the
foreman
of
parker
other
larger
crew
he
was
tall
and
ironic
he
had
a
rep
on
the
crew
for
fearlessness
at
great
heights
my
wife
cree
he
said
to
patrick
she
was
dark
with
slender
intelligent
features
she
had
a
blinding
smile
the
charm
and
pain
and
hint
of
wildness
in
her
smile
obliterated
patrick
defenses
hi
he
said
she
accepted
his
surrender
welcome
to
town
she
said
gaily
he
felt
included
gino
and
joe
had
grown
up
in
woodstock
and
were
old
friends
the
group
stood
around
telling
stories
before
gino
took
me
to
meet
his
family
cree
said
he
told
his
mother
that
he
had
fallen
for
an
older
woman
from
the
midwest
give
her
something
to
worry
about
gino

months

laughed

on
the
same
week
that

safe

a
bit
restless

model
patrick
asked

cree
said
and
led
sally
away
parker
put
on
a
dixieland
album
vassar
gino
was
a
dartmouth
graduate
joe
burke
was
doing
carpentry
work
but
had
dropped
out
of
hamilton
college
he
and
gino
were
writers
of
some
kind
patrick
felt
that
he
had
stumbled
into
an
alternative
world
the
more
educated
you
were
the
less
money
you
made
or
something
he
did
understand
this
world
it
attracted
him
and
put
him
off
it
was
free
in
a
way
that
seemed
good
but
it
was
threatening
somehow
there
was
something
overripe
about
it
he
went
outside
and
had
a
hamburger
served
to
him
by
the
older
boy
the
smell
of
meat
cooking
on
the
grill
was
delicious
smoke
rose
drawing
patrick
eyes
up
the
dark
green
mountain
to
the
ridge
line
an
walk
above
them
so
how
do
you
like
our
fair
town
hildy
asked
very
fair
it
is
patrick
said
good
burger
plenty
more
where
that
came
from
patrick
heard
a
trace
of
europe
in
her
voice
are
you
from
woodstock
i
was
born
in
the
netherlands
she
said
we
came
over
not
long
after
the
war
i
used
to
live
in
germany
patrick
said
very
different
ja
hildy
said
and
yelled
at
alden
the
youngest
to
get
away
from
the
road
she
turned
back
to
patrick
what
brings
you
to
woodstock
i
heard
it
was
an
interesting
place
my
father
lived
here
for
a
couple
of
years
once
there
are
a
lot
of
artists
hildy
said
musicians
too
and
writers
they
all
artists
i
guess
parker
likes
having
people
on
his
crew
he
can
talk
to
are
you
a
painter
nope
i
not
anything
yet
hildy
looked
at
him
hmmm
she
said
i
a
mother
and
a
cook
i
think
i
could
learn
to
cook
patrick
said
sure
you
could
it
just
takes
practice
and
you
have
to
love
it
that
the
secret
ingredient
you
have
to
love
it
alden
patrick
finished
his
burger
thanked
parker
and
hildy
and
walked
down
the
road
as
the
sounds
of
the
party
faded
behind
him
he
began
to
relax
he
had
realized
how
tense
he
been
what
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
himself
parties
are
for
fun
right
but
he
had
to
admit
that
it
had
been
fun
not
really
interesting
but
not
fun
what
is
fun
is
it
when
you
do
care
what
happens
he
turned
down
rock
city
road
toward
town
if
you
did
care
at
all
you
would
be
interested
in
what
happened
it
would
matter
how
could
that
be
fun
but
if
you
cared
a
lot
you
would
be
too
tense
to
have
fun
i
guess
he
thought
you
have
to
care
a
little
enough
to
be
interested
but
not
too
much
he
tended
to
be
on
or
off
he
cared
intensely
or
he
did
care
at
all
in
this
case
he
thought
he
cared
too
much
he
wanted
a
woman
he
was
just
as
good
as
joe
burke
or
gino
canzoni
they
had
women
beauties
they
were
citizens
or
writers
or
artists
or
whatever
they
were
who
was
he
patrick
could
answer
that
question
he
just
knew
that
he
was
as
good
as
they
were
that
meant
that
somehow
someday
he
would
show
up
at
a
party
with
someone
like
amber
and
make
jokes
and
have
fun
this
was
a
cheerful
thought
but
in
the
meantime
he
had
to
learn
more
science
and
art
what
the
hell
was
art
all
about
by
the
time
he
reached
town
patrick
was
singing
songs
from
a
burl
ives
record
that
his
mother
used
to
play
when
patrick
was
a
little
boy
can
there
be
a
cherry
that
has
no
stone
how
can
there
be
a
baby
with
no
cryin
willow
lifted
groceries
from
the
bicycle
basket
took
them
inside
and
set
them
on
the
counter
with
a
satisfying
thump
onions
garlic
a
green
pepper
a
red
pepper
basil
a
can
of
coconut
milk
a
can
of
chicken
stock
a
small
can
of
curry
paste
chicken
lettuce
and
two
bottles
of
gewurztraminer
the
wine
was
extravagant
no
doubt
about
that
but
for
once
it
was
her
money
ann
had
given
her
a
job
mornings
at
the
deli
willow
took
her
first
pay
directly
to
the
grand
union
supermarket
she
had
been
to
the
library
and
copied
a
recipe
for
curry
and
the
name
of
the
recommended
wine
she
put
the
wine
in
the
refrigerator
amber
owed
art
a
meal
and
willow
had
volunteered
to
cook
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
warm
too
early
to
start
she
was
tempted
to
lie
down
and
read
but
instead
she
took
a
straw
hat
from
a
peg
by
the
door
and
walked
outside
bees
were
buzzing
in
the
roses
the
tops
of
the
trees
were
dark
against
a
bright
blue
sky
her
feet
led
her
into
the
pine
woods
on
the
far
side
of
the
studio
where
a
deep
layer
of
pine
needles
softened
her
steps
she
walked
for
five
minutes
and
stopped
in
the
distance
a
chainsaw
snarled
twice
and
was
silent
the
air
was
still
and
resinous
small
sounds
filtered
through
the
branches
above
her
a
young
chickadee
flew
toward
her
pausing
briefly
on
low
branches
willow
remained
motionless
the
tiny
black
and
white
bird
hopped
and
flew
directly
to
her
shoulder
she
felt
its
thin
claws
shift
as
its
head
turned
first
one
way
then
the
other
it
rested
a
moment
as
willow
filled
with
a
mixture
of
elation
and
deep
humility
a
quick
whirring
of
wings
and
the
chickadee
was
ten
yards
farther
on
its
way
willow
remained
still
her
eyes
misty
her
mouth
slightly
open
she
let
the
special
feeling
spread
through
to
her
fingertips
and
the
soles
of
her
feet
no
words
for
this
she
thought
as
if
in
answer
the
chickadee
called
that
it
willow
said
to
herself
two
notes
descending
a
major
third
she
repeated
the
two
notes
in
her
mind
the
call
and
the
feeling
and
the
quiet
beating
of
her
heart
wove
together
like
a
shawl
to
be
saved
for
the
future
hers
her
god
she
said
she
was
thirsty
she
continued
slowly
through
the
woods
working
her
way
downhill
at
some
point
she
would
meet
the
lower
road
and
she
could
walk
back
to
the
beginning
of
ahnree
driveway
she
came
to
the
top
of
a
ledge
which
she
followed
until
she
found
a
place
to
scramble
down
at
the
base
of
the
ledge
she
straightened
and
listened
banjo
notes
were
picking
their
way
through
the
trees
an
easy
deliberate
rhythm
drew
her
along
and
down
the
hill
farther
from
ahnree
drive
the
notes
grew
louder
willow
could
see
a
clearing
and
part
of
a
roof
line
through
the
trees
someone
was
playing
in
the
back
yard
she
paused
the
player
was
practicing
getting
into
it
further
and
further
my
day
for
music
she
thought
when
it
stopped
she
clapped
with
pleasure
and
emerged
from
the
trees
onto
a
rough
lawn
the
banjo
player
was
sitting
under
a
birch
tree
on
a
wooden
kitchen
chair
right
on
excuse
me
she
said
i
was
walking
and
i
stopped
to
listen
where
am
i
cripple
creek
he
said
and
smiled
my
back
yard
my
mother
actually
he
was
tall
and
thin
with
shoulder
length
reddish
hair
and
a
wispy
mustache
that
was
supposed
to
make
him
look
older
his
hands
were
large
long
fingers
wrapped
around
the
neck
of
the
banjo
he
was
holding
upright
on
his
lap
i
willow
i
live
up
there
in
ahnree
studio
she
pointed
up
the
mountain
ah
yes
ahnree
i
martin
lower
byrdcliffe
road
is
just
down
at
the
end
of
the
driveway
willow
could
decide
whether
he
was
shy
or
busy
he
seemed
to
be
telling
her
to
hoof
it
the
devil
made
me
do
it
that
what
she
told
amber
later
i
can
play
cripple
creek
oh
yeah
he
held
the
banjo
toward
her
not
on
that
do
you
have
a
violin
umm
fiddle
strangely
enough
he
stood
up
leaned
the
banjo
against
the
chair
and
said
be
right
back
now
what
have
i
done
willow
asked
herself
she
had
touched
a
violin
in
two
years
he
brought
her
an
old
violin
nothing
special
but
the
strings
and
the
bow
were
in
good
shape
she
played
a
few
notes
been
a
while
she
said
she
played
the
first
bars
of
such
an
easy
melody
it
sounded
horrible
she
stopped
just
a
second
she
took
two
deep
breaths
and
let
the
feel
come
back
to
her
she
played
one
long
slow
note
listening
better
she
played
the
note
again
she
played
two
notes
her
body
began
to
wake
up
it
was
surprising
how
you
played
the
violin
with
your
whole
body
i
mean
god
she
been
playing
since
she
was
three
she
began
again
more
slowly
she
had
now
forgotten
martin
she
played
it
through
then
again
a
little
faster
yes
she
thought
and
took
it
at
a
tempo
close
to
the
one
she
heard
through
the
trees
halfway
through
she
heard
a
few
tentative
notes
from
the
banjo
she
smiled
eased
back
and
let
martin
lead
they
played
until
they
had
managed
a
decent
version
and
stopped
there
was
another
burst
of
applause
a
woman
with
short
blonde
hair
and
a
heart
shaped
face
was
clapping
by
the
corner
of
the
house
hi
mom
this
is
my
mother
heidi
ah
willow
how
do
you
do
his
mother
said
very
nice
willow
appeared
out
of
the
woods
martin
said
ah
his
mother
said
a
wood
nymph
this
is
the
time
of
year
although
i
must
say
musical
wood
nymphs
are
rare
well
willow
said
handing
the
violin
and
bow
to
martin
i
off
to
gather
mushrooms
back
to
my
dwelling
of
twigs
and
pine
cones
she
smiled
at
martin
mother
the
pretty
bitch
and
walked
into
the
woods
without
looking
back
damned
if
she
was
going
to
go
down
their
driveway
a
few
moments
later
she
heard
as
if
in
apology
or
was
he
just
going
back
to
work
there
was
something
familiar
about
martin
an
intangible
set
to
his
attitude
a
stubbornness
she
thought
back
over
her
friends
but
could
come
up
with
the
match
memory
is
strange
she
thought
all
in
there
but
you
lose
the
keys
the
entry
ways
it
like
a
city
that
keeps
growing
and
growing
i
mean
you
have
to
go
back
and
back
to
the
old
neighborhoods
lennie
rosenbloom
rosenbloom
to
her
encouraging
but
firm
as
she
struggled
through
that
mozart
sonata
his
hurt
smile
directing
her
to
feel
the
music
he
was
shorter
than
martin
and
his
hair
was
sandy
colored
god
the
light
on
his
neck
and
chest
she
was
so
close
to
blushing
all
the
time
that
she
had
to
act
like
a
zombie
to
keep
herself
under
control
played
like
one
too
god
no
it
was
rosenbloom
the
road
appeared
beyond
a
clump
of
bushes
she
pushed
through
and
turned
toward
ahnree
she
had
walked
farther
than
she
thought
by
the
time
she
reached
the
driveway
she
was
worrying
about
dinner
she
planned
as
she
hurried
up
the
hill
toward
the
studio
first
the
onions
and
the
peppers
get
them
going
in
the
large
cast
iron
frying
pan
second
the
chicken
cut
in
chunks
then
the
chicken
stock
and
the
coconut
milk
the
curry
and
the
basil
whoops
forgot
the
rice
start
that
right
after
the
onions
and
the
peppers
give
it
time
to
steam
a
little
and
not
be
so
wet
she
placed
the
straw
hat
on
its
peg
drank
a
large
glass
of
water
and
played
a
rolling
she
sang
along
as
she
cut
up
onions
be
on
your
whack
whack
does
it
feel
whack
whack
amber
and
art
arrived
in
the
middle
of
listen
to
that
she
said
as
bob
dylan
harmonica
blew
out
the
pain
and
isolation
damn
art
said
that
smells
good
listen
willow
said
turning
up
the
volume
send
me
no
more
letters
no
not
unless
you
mail
them
from
desolation
dylan
intensity
the
smell
of
curry
amber
perfect
body
next
to
art
shoulders
and
her
own
unnamed
passion
coalesced
into
another
moment
she
would
never
forget
too
much
she
said
when
the
piece
ended
want
some
wine
she
busied
herself
with
dinner
earlier
with
the
chickadee
on
her
shoulder
she
was
a
child
of
the
universe
now
she
felt
reborn
as
an
adult
it
was
so
lonely
and
sad
so
terminal
she
looked
at
amber
and
art
they
did
not
appear
to
be
in
crisis
art
was
lighting
up
a
joint
willow
took
a
few
hits
out
of
politeness
she
did
mind
getting
high
once
in
awhile
but
the
smoke
in
her
lungs
felt
foreign
and
unhealthy
amber
who
smoked
cigarettes
occasionally
dragged
away
with
gusto
the
little
pothead
art
was
following
her
around
with
his
eyes
as
though
he
were
chained
she
served
and
poured
they
ate
and
drank
the
evening
got
blurry
willow
told
them
about
the
chickadee
and
about
playing
yeah
art
said
he
lives
in
a
house
behind
his
mother
she
got
money
or
the
family
does
do
know
much
about
martin
he
went
to
private
school
was
only
around
summers
his
father
was
a
pilot
he
died
about
ten
years
ago
he
plays
banjo
pretty
well
willow
said
yeah
i
guess
how
come
you
stopped
playing
the
violin
willow
scratched
one
knee
i
love
the
old
greats
she
said
i
mean
they
are
great
souls
but
they
were
your
soul
art
said
no
i
mean
they
are
but
they
are
she
put
her
hands
behind
her
head
into
her
hair
and
paused
spreading
her
arms
out
slowly
letting
long
dark
strands
run
through
her
fingers
and
fan
across
her
shoulders
she
shook
her
head
i
did
want
to
be
stuck
in
that
scene
forever
doors
were
closing
willow
father
is
a
music
prof
amber
said
my
mother
plays
too
willow
said
a
nice
jewish
musical
family
with
perfect
children
who
know
how
to
get
along
what
wrong
with
getting
along
amber
smiled
meaningfully
in
direction
maybe
you
could
sing
you
look
a
little
like
joan
baez
art
was
a
decent
guy
really
and
he
had
those
shoulders
willow
ears
were
buzzing
i
wish
she
said
you
got
any
coltrane
the
guy
was
full
of
surprises
we
do
she
rose
slowly
and
flipped
through
the
albums
that
amber
had
borrowed
from
ahnree
night
music
she
said
putting
it
on
the
stereo
amber
was
smiling
broadly
and
wiggling
her
toes
ice
cream
she
said
willow
remembered
that
she
had
to
work
in
the
morning
bedtime
for
me
she
said
amber
promised
to
do
the
dishes
great
dinner
art
said
she
closed
the
porch
door
behind
her
and
stepped
out
of
her
clothes
feeling
the
cool
night
air
on
her
skin
she
stretched
reaching
high
with
her
fingers
and
then
slid
her
hands
appraisingly
down
her
sides
and
hips
this
feeling
of
aloneness
this
new
sense
of
herself
so
bad
whatever
it
was
it
was
real
she
pulled
a
blue
broadcloth
nightshirt
over
her
head
and
lay
in
bed
drifting
away
from
the
muffled
tenor
sax
out
toward
the
trees
and
the
summer
night
the
quiet
lured
her
not
so
much
for
itself
although
it
was
wonderful
but
for
what
might
arise
within
it
in
the
morning
art
truck
was
gone
amber
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
the
dishes
were
dry
upside
down
in
neat
piles
willow
ate
a
bowl
of
cold
cereal
with
milk
and
then
rode
into
town
the
first
thing
she
did
at
ann
was
to
make
a
pot
of
coffee
drinking
too
much
wine
gave
her
a
headache
but
dope
left
her
head
filled
with
a
dull
cloudiness
that
drove
her
nuts
it
did
hurt
but
she
could
think
it
was
as
if
she
watched
a
dumb
television
show
all
night
dumb
dumb
dumb
she
sang
i
dumb
dumb
dumb
dumb
where
my
bass
man
she
asked
the
coffee
pot
there
we
go
she
said
as
coffee
began
running
into
the
silex
pot
dumb
dumb
deedoo
so
it
a
canary
i
hired
tweet
what
are
you
doing
up
could
sleep
smelled
the
coffee
we
had
a
late
delivery
see
if
you
can
get
the
stuff
out
before
it
gets
busy
tweet
tweet
ann
acted
grumpy
was
grumpy
especially
early
in
the
day
but
there
was
no
edge
to
it
the
feeling
was
directed
more
at
herself
willow
did
what
she
was
told
without
resentment
agreeing
with
ann
pronouncements
whenever
possible
ann
was
around
that
much
the
whole
idea
was
that
willow
would
open
the
deli
and
let
her
sleep
ann
took
a
cup
of
coffee
upstairs
grumbling
about
the
pentagon
and
johnson
war
willow
began
pricing
cans
of
delicacies
stocking
was
easy
it
was
the
little
price
stickers
that
slowed
her
down
she
was
in
the
back
room
looking
down
into
a
carton
when
a
voice
called
out
anybody
home
she
saw
a
familiar
head
of
red
hair
patrick
she
realized
as
she
came
to
the
front
of
the
store
hi
i
was
in
the
back
now
that
was
intelligent
she
thought
patrick
was
considering
the
meat
and
cheese
on
display
in
the
counter
cooler
is
it
patrick
brilliant
he
straightened
and
turned
himself
he
said
good
morning
willow
what
are
you
doing
here
working
natch
she
saw
him
start
to
grin
probably
he
thought
she
was
a
little
rich
girl
oh
he
said
could
you
make
me
a
roast
beef
sandwich
to
go
white
wheat
pumpernickel
light
rye
dark
rye
dark
rye
you
want
some
horseradish
in
there
mayo
what
patrick
rubbed
his
chin
hell
of
a
decision
he
said
he
turned
his
face
up
to
the
universe
for
guidance
horseradish
horseradish
she
said
firmly
and
a
little
mayo
on
the
other
side
i
wrap
the
pickle
separately
so
it
wo
get
soggy
pickles
are
supposed
to
be
soggy
he
was
grinning
again
the
sandwich
patrick
ah
he
was
altogether
pleased
with
himself
she
made
the
sandwich
mumbling
like
a
junior
ann
and
at
the
last
moment
included
an
extra
pickle
there
she
said
as
he
gave
her
a
five
dollar
bill
the
edge
of
his
palm
brushed
her
fingers
she
put
the
change
on
the
counter
between
them
not
wanting
to
touch
him
again
she
was
still
feeling
his
hand
pleasantly
hard
against
hers
and
she
wanted
to
go
on
enjoying
it
off
you
go
she
said
got
ta
put
the
paint
on
the
wall
that
what
wilson
says
he
took
the
bag
and
the
change
maybe
i
see
you
and
amber
at
the
depresso
damn
him
maybe
she
gave
him
her
best
mona
lisa
smile
and
flicked
some
hair
back
over
her
shoulder
a
horn
honked
speaking
of
wilson
he
said
thanks
he
cute
she
thought
her
hand
was
still
warm
where
he
had
touched
her
like
the
ocean
his
eyes
darkened
the
deeper
she
looked
the
next
morning
patrick
was
back
good
sandwich
he
said
he
meant
it
and
she
felt
a
warm
stirring
god
not
a
blush
let
do
that
again
she
had
wanted
him
to
think
of
her
as
a
useless
rich
girl
now
she
did
want
to
be
mother
earth
she
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
and
closed
it
confusing
fortunately
he
had
turned
to
the
drinks
cooler
she
made
the
sandwich
including
the
extra
pickle
and
took
his
money
from
the
counter
as
she
reached
toward
him
with
the
change
her
arm
dipped
and
her
hand
rested
for
a
moment
on
his
palm
thanks
willow
have
to
run
bye
he
was
out
the
door
and
into
an
old
blue
pickup
before
she
could
think
of
anything
else
to
say
it
was
me
she
thought
i
did
do
that
it
was
my
arm
like
a
damned
dowsing
rod
two
guys
came
in
for
coffee
and
bagels
a
steady
flow
of
customers
kept
her
occupied
by
noon
she
was
over
the
embarrassment
but
she
was
on
alert
at
dinner
she
said
to
amber
my
goddamn
arm
was
out
of
control
amber
clapped
oh
great
willow
said
i
groping
strangers
and
you
think
everything
fine
it
is
fine
you
just
need
to
get
laid
that
all
and
how
can
you
call
patrick
a
stranger
you
known
him
for
a
month
get
laid
that
your
solution
for
everything
no
no
it
a
help
it
takes
the
pressure
off
and
it
interesting
willow
men
are
so
different
now
we
not
talking
babies
here
amber
took
a
bite
of
bread
mmm
this
bread
she
swallowed
yumm
you
getting
it
those
first
couple
of
loaves
were
kind
of
a
workout
you
could
get
some
good
men
willow
they
around
you
need
a
strategy
i
pass
out
numbers

room
in
a
quarter
of
the
upper
level
leaving
the
rest
open
you
see
them
the
finished
barn
and
the
design
together
sort
of
turning
into
each
other
neat
idea
willow
said
i

oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
amber
said
there

big
party

mountain
at
a
place
called

willow
said
if
i
have
any
numbers
left
patrick
held
the
brush
handle
between
his
palms
and
walked
to
the
middle
of
the
van
slyke
lawn
rubbing
his
hands
back
and
forth
spinning
the
brush
until
it
was
dry
see
if
you
can
finish
the
garage
by
four
parker
had
said
good
deal
it
could
be
later
than
three
the
paint
cans
were
stacked
by
the
ladder
and
the
folded
drop
cloths
he
put
the
brush
on
top
of
the
cans
took
the
rag
and
the
putty
knife
out
of
his
back
pockets
and
stepped
back
amazing
how
much
better
a
paint
job
looks
from
twenty
feet
away
he
thought
looks
good
hendrik
said
from
the
kitchen
door
yes
patrick
said
where
your
wheels
parker
going
to
pick
me
up
have
a
beer
while
you
wait
excellent
patrick
said
hendrik
went
into
the
kitchen
and
reappeared
with
two
bottles
of
heineken
he
waved
patrick
over
to
a
picnic
table
and
opened
the
bottles
with
a
pocket
knife
he
was
a
strong
man
with
a
brooding
expression
and
a
flattened
nose
he
looked
like
someone
who
might
have
painted
a
famous
picture
of
a
boxer
happy
days
hendrik
said
prosit
there
are
few
things
better
than
the
first
swallow
of
cold
beer
after
a
day
work
yes
patrick
said
looks
good
hendrik
repeated
have
to
keep
after
these
old
houses
you
got
a
nice
one
is
that
your
studio
over
there
yep
could
i
ask
you
a
question
sure
what
is
art
anyway
hendrik
raised
his
eyebrows
he
took
several
long
swallows
of
heineken
i
met
a
lot
of
artists
in
this
town
patrick
went
on
and
i
realized
that
i
do
understand
it
bunch
of
bullshit
mostly
patrick
waited
hendrik
looked
at
him
and
sighed
he
took
another
swallow
of
heineken
and
indicated
the
valley
with
one
hand
everybody
wants
to
be
an
artist
he
said
doctors
i
saw
a
clinic
the
other
day
said
arts
group
on
the
building
he
burped
it
like
this
patrick
there
art
capital
a
fine
art
it
called
sometimes
and
there
everything
else
so
what
is
this
art
hendrik
shook
his
head
he
went
into
the
house
and
came
out
with
two
more
beers
let
start
with
everything
else
he
said
it
easier
he
pried
off
the
bottle
caps
everything
else
is
commercial
art
calendar
graphics
or
posters
or
paintings
of
lighthouses
fall
foliage
the
streets
of
paris
that
kind
of
stuff
done
in
familiar
styles
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
it
is
art
it
craft
he
drank
it
craft
because
the
painters
know
what
they
doing
when
they
start
some
of
the
paintings
seem
magical
but
it
trick
magic
they
know
how
to
get
the
rabbit
out
of
the
hat
an
artist
capital
a
does
know
what
in
the
hat
or
how
to
get
it
out
hmm
patrick
said
a
guy
in
vermont
came
up
with
that
comparison
robert
francis
like
this
patrick
an
artist
needs
to
make
a
picture
that
expresses
how
he
feels
about
something
or
someone
or
some
place
since
every
artist
is
different
good
paintings
true
paintings
are
original
true
yeah
true
to
the
artist
feelings
hendrik
said
true
patrick
said
turning
the
word
over
in
his
mind
it
not
so
easy
what
the
hell
i
show
you
hendrik
got
up
and
led
patrick
to
his
studio
look
there
he
said
pointing
at
a
wall
covered
with
charcoal
drawings
of
a
nude
julie
van
slyke
fifteen
years
younger
those
are
studies
i
made
before
i
did
the
painting
you
can
see
how
i
kept
circling
around
the
central
idea
this
line
here
he
moved
one
hand
through
the
air
as
though
he
were
stroking
her
hip
once
i
got
it
right
it
was
mostly
a
matter
of
color
not
a
bad
painting
as
it
turned
out
patrick
saw
what
hendrik
meant
through
a
light
haze
of
embarrassment
he
took
a
drink
from
his
bottle
of
heineken
and
acted
grown
up
van
slyke
was
leaning
forward
she
had
unexpectedly
exotic
breasts
that
hung
and
then
swelled
upwards
the
thing
is
it
can
take
a
while
before
you
get
it
sometimes
you
never
get
it
i
been
working
on
this
one
all
year
hendrik
walked
over
to
a
heavy
wooden
easel
a
canvas
half
painted
half
sketched
in
pencil
showed
a
young
man
sitting
by
a
fireplace
and
holding
a
guitar
his
chair
was
sideways
to
the
fire
his
body
and
guitar
were
turned
toward
the
painter
there
was
a
wine
bottle
on
the
floor
next
to
the
chair
no
glass
patrick
said
he
drinking
alone
why
is
he
turned
who
is
he
looking
at
maybe
if
i
knew
that
i
could
paint
the
goddamned
thing
oh
patrick
said
i
like
it
so
far
anyway
pretty
intense
hendrik
are
you
there
with
patrick
van
slyke
voice
came
loudly
through
an
intercom
hendrik
made
a
face
went
over
to
the
door
and
pressed
a
plastic
button
yes
dear
parker
is
here
for
patrick
be
right
there
hendrik
said
they
walked
side
by
side
to
the
main
house
patrick
felt
himself
looking
at
van
slyke
differently
he
was
seeing
her
partly
through
hendrik
eyes
as
hendrik
had
painted
her
she
was
more
female
patrick
asked
what
art
is
hendrik
explained
are
you
clear
on
that
now
van
slyke
asked
as
she
took
the
empty
bottles
from
their
hands
parker
was
grinning
on
the
sideline
umm
it
over
there
patrick
said
waving
at
the
studio
of
course
it
is
van
slyke
said
without
changing
expression
what
wonderful
crews
you
have
parker
the
place

marvelous
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
do
the
studio

on
on
my
list
parker
promised

get
the
ladder
on
the
rack
thanks
for
the
heineken
patrick
said
to
hendrik
good
job
hendrik
said
goodbye
patrick
i
hope
that
we
see
you
again
van
slyke
smiled
and
waited
for
his
reaction
bye
he
said
they
hustled
off
on
their
way
down
the
mountain
he
felt
the
mood
lighten
whew
he
said

the
depresso

patrick
see
you
in
the
morning
patrick
skipped
down
the
stone
steps
to
the
depresso
patio
willow
was
reading
at
a
table
leaning
back
her
long
legs
stretched
out
before
her
crossed
at
the
ankles
hey
willow

patted
his
stomach

she
said

the
matter

the
most
amazing
questions
well
i
asked
hendrik
van
slyke
and
he
showed
me
his
studio
modest
hendrik
he
was
modest
in
a
frustrated
way
he
showed
me
a
painting
that
been
working
on
all
year
said
he
could
get
it
he
said
that
art
had
to
be
true
he
did
willow
clapped
her
hand
over
her
mouth
patrick
looked
at
her
you
think
i
a
moron
she
took
her
hand
away
i
am
but
i
a
persistent
moron
he
took
a
swallow
of
beer
true
he
said
i
know
about
true
in
science
what
is
true
can
be
verified
what
is
true
is
true
for
everybody
but
hendrik
true
is
only
true
for
hendrik
especially
true
for
hendrik
willow
said
so
it
a
different
kind
of
true
patrick
finished
different
from
science
willow
said
but
useful
useful
patrick
thought
like
beethoven
or
dylan
true
she
said
patrick
watched
people
on
the
sidewalk
there
more
he
said
after
a
moment
there
more
about
this
art
and
science
stuff
i
understand
it
yet
what
the
matter
he
asked
for
the
second
time
willow
was
wiping
tears
from
her
cheeks
it
not
your
fault
she
said
she
stood
suddenly
i
going
now
she
pedaled
away
with
her
book
in
the
basket
what
did
i
say
he
wondered
he
went
inside
scratching
his
head
sue
and
jim
were
at
the
bar
he
thought
about
his
usual
dinner
of
rice
and
vegetables
to
hell
with
it
deanie
he
said
to
himself
and
went
back
outside
willow
was
gone
he
walked
past
the
news
shop
and
ann
deli
and
turned
down
the
hill
to
deanie
for
a
celebratory
steak
still
wondering
what
had
upset
willow
the
dining
room
was
comfortably
filled
cheerful
without
being
noisy
a
bar
stretched
the
length
of
one
end
of
the
room
sam
was
there
by
himself
and
said
hello
patrick
excused
himself
as
soon
as
he
could
and
sat
at
a
small
table
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
sam
was
always
mouthing
off
about
the
government
and
asking
everyone
where
he
could
score
some
grass
he
was
nervous
in
a
way
that
put
patrick
off
patrick
did
want
to
hassle
with
anyone
who
worked
for
parker
so
he
kept
his
mouth
shut
and
avoided
him
meat
he
said
to
sam
i
got
this
craving
for
meat
got
to
have
it
yeah
man
sam
eyes
darted
around
as
patrick
escaped
medium
rare
patrick
ordered
and
by
god
that
what
he
was
served
delicious
he
ate
slowly
each
bite
a
eating
out
was
important
to
patrick
while
he
was
working
he
worked
hard
concentrating
dinner
was
a
time
to
relax
to
think
and
to
look
around
he
enjoyed
being
in
the
midst
of
people
without
necessarily
having
to
talk
to
anyone
the
deanie
crowd
was
straighter
than
the
depresso
crowd
and
local
business
people
mixed
with
musicians
and
artists
the
waitresses
were
the
pies
were
particularly
good
this
was
patrick
third
dinner
at
deanie
he
was
beginning
to
feel
more
at
home
in
woodstock
his
landlady
gert
had
become
more
friendly
patrick
was
willing
to
help
with
little
things
around
the
house
that
probably
had
something
to
do
with
it
she
was
a
reader
too
he
discovered
they
talked
about
books
the
other
day
asked
her
what
she
was
reading
every
story
is
a
love
story
is
it
patrick
she
had
chuckled
comfortably
and
continued
reading
he
did
know
what
to
make
of
that
did
she
mean
every
story
about
anything
or
every
story
a
writer
felt
was
worth
the
effort
she
had
said
it
as
though
it
were
self
evident
as
though
he
should
be
pestering
her
for
an
explanation
or
maybe
he
was
supposed
to
figure
it
out
for
himself
wonderful
pie
he
said
to
the
waitress
we
make
a
lot
of
them
she
said
patrick
left
a
big
tip
and
walked
slowly
toward
home
he
had
an
urge
for
a
hershey
bar
as
he
passed
ann
ann
took
his
change
without
comment
willow
makes
a
good
sandwich
he
said
you
like
her
do
you
she
said
accusingly
he
did
know
what
to
say
ann
glared
at
him
you
young
people
think
we
do
feel
anything
well
you
wrong
what
your
name
patrick
we
have
feelings
too
you
think
we
were
young
once
sorry
he
said
unsure
night
he
moved
toward
the
door
remember
that
patrick
she
flung
at
his
back
another
upset
woman
what
was
getting
into
everybody
he
looked
into
the
window
of
the
depresso
sue
and
jim
were
there
the
go
player
who
had
annoyed
him
on
his
first
night
in
town
was
sitting
on
a
stool
in
a
corner
playing
a
banjo
the
metallic
beat
followed
him
a
short
distance
up
tinker
street
a
sort
of
urban
bluegrass
it
was
a
relief
to
go
quietly
to
bed
with
his
book
on
mathematics
the
next
morning
it
was
pouring
patrick
trudged
to
the
news
shop
where
parker
declared
a
washout
gino
as
senior
man
got
to
work
on
an
inside
job
everyone
else
was
off
for
the
day
the
group
milled
around
joking
with
a
drunk
who
kept
coming
in
and
out
clapping
people
on
the
back
breathing
beer
fumes
in
their
faces
and
saying
how

they

billy
escorted
them
to
the
open

the
steps
into
the
rain
quack

patrick
said

took
him
along
the
street
to
ann
where
he
hesitated
and
then
went
in
hi
willow

out
willow
looked
up
no
one

in
the
deli
patrick
i
sorry

abruptly
last

she
smiled
at
him
reprovingly
anyway
i
ca

without

sandwiches
how

today
he
stowed
the
sandwich
in
a
small
army
surplus
backpack
that
he
bought
after
his
first
week
in
town
what
are
you
going

reading
a
great
book
on
mathematics
there
supposed
to
be
a

this

saturday
on
the
mountain
mead
meadow
wherever

good
time

it
every

a
while
anyway
maybe
i
see
you
there
patrick
said
day
after
tomorrow
the
rain
should
be
over
by
then
willow
seemed
pleased
and
patrick
left
for
the
library
hard
to
figure
he
thought
last
night
she
would
talk
to
me
this
morning
she
invites
me
to
a
party
he
thought
he
go
if
he
could
find
it
maybe
art
would
fall
off
the
mountain
the
library
was
pleasant
and
well
lit
the
science
section
was
a
bit
out
of
date
there
were
many
expensive
art
books
locked
in
a
big
case
the
children
room
was
large
and
cheerful
with
a
painted
wooden
riding
horse
in
one
corner
he
read
for
an
hour
and
thought
of
writing
to
his
parents
but
he
had
looked
up
his
father
friend
he
wanted
to
do
that
before
he
wrote
so
he
asked
for
a
telephone
book
heidi
merrill
was
listed
with
an
address
on
lower
byrdcliffe
road
there
was
no
pay
phone
in
the
library
so
he
walked
over
to
the
woodstock
laundromat
joe
burke
was
folding
clothes
standing
at
a
counter
beside
a
tall
slender
woman
with
long
hair
she
was
teasing
him
about
his
folding
he
leaned
and
said
something
softly
in
her
ear
that
made
her
laugh
her
voice
was
low
and
appealing
it
sounded
to
patrick
as
though
it
had
started
in
texas
and
traveled
around
the
world
before
it
got
to
the
laundromat
the
energy
between
the
two
was
intense
and
relaxed
at
the
same
time
patrick
stared
hello
patrick
joe
said
turning
this
is
daisy
hello
patrick
daisy
echoed
she
looked
at
him
with
calm
gray
eyes
and
then
picked
up
her
basket
of
clothes
well
she
said
onward
joe
said
yes
their
eyes
met
and
she
left
walking
as
though
she
were
going
slightly
uphill
patrick
felt
suddenly
lonely
so
patrick
what
happening
patrick
looked
back
from
the
door
oh
i
trying
to
find
someone
named
heidi
merrill
do
you
know
where
she
lives
sure
do
going
right
by
there
if
you
want
a
lift
what
the
hell
patrick
thought
nothing
else
to
do
it
does
matter
if
she
home
or
not
good
deal
they
drove
out
of
library
lane
passing
billy
at
the
entrance
to
tinker
street
joe
rolled
his
window
all
the
way
open
hey
billy
want
a
lift
quack
you
want
me
to
miss
my
shower
as
they
drove
through
town
patrick
said
i
met
him
this
morning
in
the
news
shop
quite
a
character
yeah
we
go
way
back
joe
said
used
to
take
me
pickerel
fishing
billy
did
one
of
my
heroes
he
just
got
out
of
the
slammer
what
did
he
do
one
of
the
state
cops
dusty
rhodes
drove
his
cruiser
into
driveway
to
check
him
out
for
something
or
other
about
three
in
the
morning
the
way
billy
tells
it
he
woke
up
with
a
headache
listening
to
a
siren
he
looked
out
his
upstairs
bedroom
window
damn
flashing
light
hurt
my
eyes
billy
said
so
he
shot
it
out
with
a
dusty
arrested
him
for
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
and
the
judge
asked
him
what
he
had
to
say
for
himself
honor
billy
said
do
you
think
if
i
wanted
to
hit
dusty
i
have
missed
him
the
judge
gave
him
six
months
he
seems
like
a
good
guy
patrick
said
he
is
that
the
merrill
road
there
patrick
thanked
joe
and
walked
fifty
yards
through
trees
to
a
rambling
house
with
clapboard
siding
stained
brown
there
was
a
second
smaller
house
or
studio
some
distance
behind
and
to
the
right
a
green
cadillac
at
least
ten
years
old
gleamed
in
front
of
the
house
patrick
knocked
on
the
screen
door
a
woman
with
a
heart
shaped
face
wheat
colored
hair
and
clear
eyes
answered
his
knock
yes
good
morning

heidi
merrill
she
nodded
my
name
is
patrick
she
straightened
my
father

that

asked
me
to
say

a
surprise
you
must
tell
brian
that

in
she
led
patrick
to
a
spacious
kitchen
where
she
poured
coffee
into
mugs
so
patrick
how

month

martin
my

he
lives
in
the
studio
behind
the
house
she
looked
at
him
closely

an
intercom
much
like
the
van
slyke
martin
martin
can
you
come
over
patrick
is
here
his
father

an
old
friend
a
voice
crackled
through
the
speaker
just
a
minute
patrick
looked
around
nice
house
he
said
we
been
here
many
years
there
was
a
defensive
note
in
her
voice
that
surprised
him
as
he
was
telling
her
about
his
job
a
tall
man
in
his
late
twenties
pushed
open
the
kitchen
door
he
walked
directly
over
holding
out
his
hand
patrick
yes

said
standing
and
shaking
hands

ignored
his
mother
and
stared
at

thought

clapped
his
hands
together
and

patrick
imagined
him
playing
the
fiddle

large
hands

the
fiddle
martin
was
like
a
softer
version
of
his
dad

and
thin
heidi

closely

to
feel

little
logging

down
through
the
woods
a
little
ways
across
a
wet
spot
and
up
onto
the
meadow
thanks
patrick
waved
and
watched
him
drive
away
neat
car
he
said
hello
to
gert
and
ate
his
sandwich
on
the
porch
thinking
hard
he
started
to
write
a
letter
to
his
parents
but
he
crumpled
it
after
the
first
paragraph
he
went
inside
gert
was
busy
in
the
back
of
the
house
he
hesitated
and
then
picked
up
the
telephone
and
called
home
collect
by
good
luck
his
father
answered
dad
this
is
pat
pat
where
are
you
i
in
woodstock
great
town
i
just
looked
up
heidi
and
martin
merrill

his
father
voice
sounded
far
away
fine
they
got
a
big
place
she
nice
makes
good
coffee
martin
plays
the
fiddle
patrick
paused
his
hands
dad
they
are
just
like
yours
like
mine
he
reminds
me
of
you
patrick
ran
out
of
words
there
was
a
brief
silence
it
a
long
story
pat
i
tell
you
about
it
the
next
time
we
get
together
martin
is
your
patrick
let
out
his
breath
i
was
wondering
i
did
say
anything
his
father
was
silent
for
a
moment
maybe
that
best
pat
we
would
want
to
upset
anybody
only
a
couple
of
people
know
come
see
us
at
christmas
in
costa
rica
or
florida
wherever
we
end
up
talk
about
it
basically
heidi
was
afraid
she
never
have
a
baby
dad
look
i
got
to
go
thanks
for
telling
me
i
wo
say
anything
i
let
you
know
about
christmas
say
hi
to
mom
patrick
hung
up
softly
he
stood
for
several
seconds
and
then
went
back
out
on
the
porch
where
he
sat
down
again
and
watched
the
rain
i
be
damned
he
thought
his
father
must
have
been
about
his
age
when
he
was
in
woodstock
patrick
saw
him
in
a
new
way
heidi
must
have
been
incredible
she
was
still
good
looking
it
was
cool
to
have
a
brother
but
it
was
strange
not
to
be
able
to
say
anything
martin
did
seem
like
a
bad
guy
for
someone
who
had
it
easy
patrick
the
window
at
the
end
of
the
upstairs
hall
is
stuck
could
you
close
it
for
me
glad
to
keep
it
quiet
he
thought
climbing
the
stairs
maybe
talk
about
it
at
christmas
see
what
happens
willow
followed
amber
and
art
across
a
small
stream
much
farther
she
asked
art
pointed
through
the
trees
to
a
small
rise
right
up
there
they
emerged
onto
a
meadow
that
dropped
abruptly
into
a
narrow
valley
willow
could
see
nothing
but
mountain
after
mountain
in
the
distance
no
roads
no
houses
an
upright
piano
stood
by
itself
in
the
meadow
the
last
point
of
local
focus
before
her
eyes
leaped
into
the
space
beyond
and
below
wow
amber
and
art
chose
a
place
not
far
from
a
fire
where
a
dozen
people
were
sitting
and
standing
laughing
drinking
beer
willow
removed
her
pack
she
spread
a
blanket
and
weighed
it
down
with
the
pack
which
held
a
bottle
of
water
two
bottles
of
wine
a
paperback
copy
of
lawrence
durrell
justine
and
a
loaf
of
her
best
honey
walnut
bread
art
went
immediately
to
the
keg
too
much
amber
said
looking
at
the
view
i
wonder
if
patrick
will
show
willow
said
did
you
tell
him
where
it
was
i
did
give
him
directions
but
guys
on
his
crew
would
know
he
come
amber
said
and
if
he
does
that
his
problem
how
did
they
get
the
piano
up
here
she
asked
art
who
was
back
holding
three
paper
cups
of
beer
carried
it
he
said
four
guys
one
on
each
corner
they
bring
it
in
every
year
it
angus
he
has
a
band
plays
dixieland
and
early
jazz
oooh
willow
said
stride
piano
she
had
grown
up
listening
to
scott
joplin
jelly
roll
morton
and
fats
waller
her
father
nod
to
modernity
straight
from
bach
he
used
to
say

sipped
her
beer
martin
merrill
arrived
hey

art
hi
willow
hey
martin
this
is
amber
where
your
fiddle

in
the
car
maybe
we
get
to
a
little
cripple
creek
later
willow
flushed
i
think
i
retired
she
said
not
allowed
martin
was
having
trouble
keeping
his
eyes
off
amber
who
had
shifted
to
ground
midway
between
a
barnwarmer
dream
and
a
folksinger
groupie
here
we
go
again
willow
thought
how
that
chevy
running
art
asked
good

art
said
people
were
arriving
steadily
it

five
the
heat
of
the
day
was
easing
a
strong
looking
man
in
his
thirties
with
a
short
beard
and
dark
curly
hair
began
to
play
the
piano
his
back
straight
yo
angus
someone
called
martin
went
for
a
refill
and
returned
a
few
minutes
later
as
willow
was
looking
around
the
meadow
she
stop
herself
every
few
minutes
she
checked
again
looking
for
someone
martin
asked
yeah

guy
i
met
patrick
patrick
yes
i
be
damned
i
met
him
the
other
day
patrick
she
thought
martin
reminded
her
of
patrick
that
who
it
was
more
people
arrived
a
soprano
sax
joined
the
piano
a
man
with
gray
hair
set
up
a
drum
kit
joe
burke
stood
near
the
piano
with
a
blonde
leggy
like
me
willow
thought
but
better
looking
they
came
over
and
sat
down
joe
introduced
her
his
wife
sally
he
reached
into
a
paper
bag
and
handed
everyone
a
sparkler
it
the
he
said
they
lit
the
sparklers
and
sat
more
or
less
in
a
circle
waving
them
and
drinking
beer
my
country
is
of
thee
amber
said
old
glory
martin
added
patriots
a
familiar
voice
patrick
had
come
up
behind
her
hey
patrick
martin
stood
waved
at
patrick
and
wandered
toward
the
kegs
patrick
sat
down
next
to
willow
joe
handed
him
a
sparkler
willow
leaned
back
on
her
elbows
the
strains
of
james
and
a
heavy
beat
from
the
drummer
mingled
with
the
smell
of
burning
sparklers
and
the
sweeter
smell
of
marijuana
it
good
to
be
a
citizen
patrick
said
willow
inspected
him
for
signs
of
irony
none
they
talked
briefly
about
the
war
which
they
were
all
against
it
seemed
far
away
a
bad
dream
maybe
we
should
get
active
patrick
suggested
demonstrate
or
something
joe
leaned
forward
you
want
to
watch
it
he
said
what
do
you
mean
i
had
kind
of
a
shock
last
week
joe
said
you
know
ox
he
looked
at
the
others
sure
art
said
he
was
in
school
with
us
he
a
state
trooper
joe
explained
had
narcs
around
for
a
few
years
now
busting
people
for
the
evil
weed
shit
heads
art
said
like
we
really
have
a
drug
problem
we
spot
the
narcs
joe
said
anyway
i
was
having
a
beer
with
ox
in
buckman
and
he
told
me
to
watch
my
ass
he
told
me
there
was
a
list
of
radicals
at
headquarters
subversives
watching
you
all
i
can
say
joe
shook
his
head
i
mean
i
a
veteran
for
christ
sake
you
a
dropout
art
said
joe
started
to
smile
look
who
talking
so
who
watching
martin
asked
somebody
is
joe
said
ox
would
have
told
me
if
he
worried
fbi
cia
martin
a
commie
pinko
art
said
is
he
on
the
list
should
be
joe
said
what
about
morgan
and
gino
subversives
for
sure
down
the
pentagon
joe
raised
his
cup
down
the
pentagon
echoed
across
the
valley
patrick
amber
said
you
can
turn
off
the
tape
recorder
patrick
took
a
paper
bag
from
his
pack
and
held
up
a
block
of
cheddar
he
shook
it
by
his
ear
was
on
he
said
might
as
well
eat
it
then
sally
said
they
ate
and
drank
and
wandered
around
the
meadow
a
washtub
bass
joined
the
music
willow
did
exactly
follow
patrick
but
she
managed
to
be
in
his
general
vicinity
she
returned
to
her
blanket
and
read
until
the
light
started
to
go
there
was
a
book
discussion
patrick
talked
about
a
math
book
that
he
was
reading
and
joe
got
started
on
significant
digits
of
all
things
you
understand
the
principle
he
said
natch
art
said
but
here
is
morgan
in
case
anyone
needs
a
refresher
willow
tried
to
remember
high
school
physics
while
she
watched
morgan
sit
down
deliberately
he
had
powerful
shoulders
and
a
sensitive
expression
morgan
what
are
significant
digits
ah
morgan
said
the
concept
is
that
in
scientific
computation
the
result
can
not
be
more
accurate
than
the
least
accurate
quantity
or
measurement
involved
there
was
light
applause
morgan
drank
deeply
just
so
said
joe
and
did
i
have
a
hell
of
a
time
understanding
that
i
thought
you
could
make
an
answer
as
accurate
as
you
wanted
you
want
seven
decimal
places
no
problem
patrick
was
sitting
forward
listening
intensely
i
finally
got
the
idea
and
i
never
forgot
it
joe
went
on
well
there
i
was
in
weather
school
in
the
air
force
and
their
dew
point
calculation
gave
an
answer
that
was
more
precise
than
one
of
the
measurements
decimal
points
are
meaningless
i
said
to
the
sergeant
yeah
right
next
thing
you
know
i
in
front
of
the
base
commander
he
says
may
have
a
point
but
it
a
goddamn
small
one
are
you
an
airman
or
a
goddamn
philosopher
burke
sir
i
said
airman
burke
art
toasted
willow
was
impressed
she
thought
about
stanford
the
academic
cliques
the
gorgeous
football
players
the
socialites
they
were
good
at
what
they
did
they
were
judged
by
how
they
performed
in
their
groups
they
lived
by
accepted
rules
these
people
in
mead
meadow
were
just
as
sharp
just
as
physical
in
a
different
way
maybe
a
better
way
and
just
as
easy
and
confident
they
were
all
of
the
aboves
they
were
free
they
were
alive
or
more
alive
in
a
different
way
a
shiver
ran
up
her
back
she
opened
a
bottle
of
wine
the
band
was
tighter
into
the
saints
come
marching
as
the
light
faded
the
uninhabited
range
of
mountains
before
them
became
darker
and
more
mysterious
unexpectedly
comforting
the
mountains
were
timeless
or
in
a
different
flow
of
time
this
is
what
they
saw
patrick
said
the
first
people
he
pointed
across
the
valley
do
you
want
some
wine
she
held
up
the
bottle
change
of
pace
he
said
sure
cabernet
sauvigon
she
said
with
new
authority
your
basic
meadow
red
the
firelight
cast
shadows
the
group
seemed
smaller
and
more
vulnerable
the
first
people
patrick
repeated
they
were
the
first
people
now
she
realized
she
bit
down
on
her
lip
her
heart
broke
open
like
a
swollen
peach
there
a
little
bread
left
she
said
god
she
was
crying
again
you
cry
a
lot
he
said
oh
fuck
you
patrick
she
poured
herself
more
wine
i
do
mind
it
he
said
seriously
look
do
you
want
to
go
she
asked
sure
amber
was
over
by
the
band
she
was
staying
all
night
or
going
over
to
art
willow
told
her
that
she
was
leaving
and
she
and
patrick
picked
their
way
slowly
through
the
woods
i
got
to
get
a
little
flashlight
patrick
said
as
they
splashed
across
the
stream
when
they
came
out
onto
the
road
a
patrol
car
was
parked
in
the
middle
two
cops
were
ticketing
a
long
line
of
cars
and
trucks
that
were
pulled
off
to
the
side
what
the
matter
willow
asked
blocking
the
road
obstructing
traffic
they
are
not
what
traffic
this
is
the
top
of
the
mountain
for
sake
you
want
to
give
us
a
hard
time
he
was
threatening
patrick
pulled
her
away
let
go
willow
have
you
been
drinking
lady
i
would
want
to
see
you
driving
we
walking
willow
glared
at
the
cops
and
let
patrick
guide
her
down
the
road
the
band
was
working
on
a
dixie
version
of
the
the
sax
floated
high
over
the
tree
tops
into
the
night
she
looked
back
one
of
the
cops
was
answering
a
radio
call
the
other
was
still
ticketing
they
were
trying
to
ruin
everything
why
patrick
groups
he
said
after
a
moment
tribalism
they
afraid
of
change
when
they
get
their
backs
up
willow
you
got
to
work
around
them
if
you
challenge
them
they
get
worse
it
weird
but
the
more
powerful
people
are
the
more
frightened
they
are
usually
you
think
it
would
be
the
other
way
around
we
got
to
fight
back
willow
said
we
do
by
existing
the
starlight
was
sufficient
for
them
to
walk
down
the
middle
of
the
road
they
were
quiet
and
then
they
talked
and
then
they
were
quiet
again
one
person
who
had
been
at
the
party
stopped
and
offered
a
ride
but
they
decided
to
keep
walking
patrick
told
her
about
his
parents
and
his
sister
molly
nice
people
she
wondered
where
he
got
the
hard
edge
she
sensed
beneath
the
surface
the
irish
were
his
parents
closet
rebels
maybe
probably
it
was
from
hard
knocks
for
what
from
who
for
being
honest
that
was
it
from
people
who
cut
corners
with
the
truth
to
get
ahead
or
get
along
they
were
the
same
that
way
at
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
they
turned
down
reynold
lane
to
route
and
then
up
the
glasco
turnpike
to
the
byrdcliffe
road
at
driveway
willow
said
might
as
well
walk
me
home
my
mission
patrick
said
at
the
door
she
suggested
that
they
kill
the
bottle
and
patrick
followed
her
in
she
filled
two
glasses
they
flopped
into
chairs
at
the
kitchen
table
she
should
have
been
exhausted
but
she
was
when
the
wine
was
gone
patrick
stood
before
he
spoke
she
asked
him
for
a
hug
and
before
he
answered
she
went
to
him
and
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
his
arms
went
uncertainly
around
her
she
pressed
the
whole
length
of
her
body
against
him
molding
herself
to
his
shape
his
shoulders
were
broader
than
they
looked
as
his
arms
tightened
she
felt
herself
loosen
and
grow
warm
he
took
a
deep
breath
they
were
losing
control
patrick
she
said
patrick
she
pulled
away
and
took
his
hand
let
go
out
here
she
led
him
to
the
porch
and
kicked
off
her
shoes
still
holding
his
hand
she
pulled
him
down
onto
the
bed
she
kissed
him
lightly
with
open
lips
he
was
warm
and
tasted
of
wine
and
beer
my
shoes
he
said
she
kissed
him
again
sliding
her
lips
to
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
back
as
he
bent
forward
to
take
off
his
shoes
she
unbuttoned
her
shirt
and
removed
it
she
stretched
full
length
on
the
bed
naked
to
the
waist
and
held
out
her
arms
she
heard
his
quick
intake
of
breath
and
felt
his
palm
on
her
breast
willow
she
pushed
up
against
his
hand
and
began
to
move
slowly
from
side
to
side
there
was
no
more
thinking
only
a
rush
of
feeling
she
pulled
him
into
her
and
encouraged
him
to
take
her
fuck
her
fill
her
with
his
hot
hard
energy
as
he
came
and
collapsed
she
hugged
him
with
her
arms
and
her
legs
surrounding
him
with
warmth
keeping
him
safe
she
remained
awake
savoring
the
moments
it
was
the
right
time
of
the
month
no
worries
there
her
own
need
for
orgasm
was
alive
and
well
like
a
promise
she
stroked
the
back
of
his
head
and
he
mumbled
something
in
his
sleep
god
they
were
together
she
was
still
herself
but
now
she
was
something
else
too
she
had
a
pang
of
sadness
for
squirrelie
alone
out
there
squirrelie
she
awoke
snuggled
against
patrick
back
she
reached
around
and
began
to
caress
him
he
was
inside
her
before
he
was
fully
awake
she
held
him
tightly
and
as
she
began
to
peak
she
begged
him
not
to
stop
she
was
driving
the
train
and
patrick
responded
baby
she
called
ohhhh
she
opened
like
an
exploding
flower
another
orgasm
rolled
through
her
and
then
another
and
another
completions
irreversible
she
cried
in
wonder
and
fell
back
as
he
came
adding
to
the
warm
flood
in
which
she
floated
some
time
later
she
said
the
big
bang
theory
i
get
it
patrick
rolled
out
of
bed
and
dressed
i
got
to
go
willow
he
said
she
wanted
him
to
stay
she
wanted
to
make
a
good
breakfast
for
them
she
wanted
to
talk
with
him
for
hours
but
a
deeper
voice
surprising
her
said
bye
patrick
he
looked
at
her
intently
for
a
moment
bye
patrick
she
repeated
softly
patrick
took
a
quick
step
and
kicked
a
pebble
into
the
woods
along
ahnree
driveway
it
would
be
fun
to
practice
corner
kicks
again
willow
was
intense
nice
too
dynamite
in
bed
who
would
have
thought
it
he
blasted
another
pebble
between
two
trees
goal
it
was
going
to
be
hot
later
breakfast
in
the
news
shop
would
be
a
good
thing
coffee
a
fried
egg
sandwich
willow
legs
wrapped
around
him
and
he
relaxed
for
a
moment
remembering
her
hair
against
his
cheek
and
over
his
shoulders
where
she
had
covered
him
he
felt
a
new
sweetness
inside
his
head
swam
too
much
he
said
to
the
fans
in
the
woods
and
ran
twenty
yards
to
wake
up
billy
jakes
slapped
him
on
the
back
in
the
news
shop
long
night
huh
patrick
long
night
billy
just
as
well
he
did
have
to
work
today
he
took
a
bite
of
his
fried
egg
sandwich
and
thought
about
the
first
people
and
the
view
from
mead
meadow
the
green
of
the
mountains
was
so
fresh
empty
as
one
of
the
new
canvases
stacked
against
hendrik
studio
wall
the
first
people
had
done
well
really
they
deserved
a
celebration
it
was
a
righteous
fourth
martin
was
there
at
first
where
had
he
gone
patrick
wanted
to
know
more
about
him
the
music
was
great
and
then
those
cops
they
were
really
the
losers
the
ones
left
out
or
behind
why
did
that
have
to
be
officer
allen
ha
ha
ha
patrick
turned
and
saw
billy
put
an
arm
around
one
of
the
cops
who
had
been
on
the
mountain
the
larger
one
got
ta
smoke
i
innocent

obliged
allen

took
a
deep
drag
i

you
drinking
on
the
street
i
going
to
lock
you
up
i
am
much
obliged
billy
began
to
cough
he
went
outside
and
officer
allen
waved
his
arm
as
if
to
clear
the
air
there
was
a
polite
silence
punctuated
by
billy
coughs
which
grew
fainter
as
he
moved
down
the
sidewalk
officer
allen
left
with
a
newspaper
and
a
supply
of
marlboros
gert
was
sitting
on
the
porch
when
patrick
arrived
home
morning
gert
she
looked
him
over
and
smiled
broadly
good
morning
i
a
job
for
you
if
you
a
mind
to
do
it
well
i
was
going
to
work
on
the
unified
field
theory
but
the
big
bang
theory
he
started
to
smile
and
found
himself
turning
red
are
we
in
a
good
mood
gert
said
what
needs
doing
the
attic
i
been
cleaning
and
i
need
some
boxes
brought
down
to
the
shed
they
too
heavy
for
me
she
led
him
up
two
flights
of
stairs
and
pointed
out
a
group
of
boxes
fred
is
coming
to
haul
them
away
some
time
next
week
it
time
to
get
rid
of
things
no
problem
is
that
where
you
keep
your
gold
patrick
pointed
at
a
small
iron
bound
chest
secured
by
a
black
lock
right
out
of
treasure
island
he
said
other
treasures
gert
said
could
you
move
it
over
there
by
those
books
good
just
cover
it
with
the
same
sheet
thank
you
patrick
made
ten
trips
to
the
shed
feeling
better
with
each
trip
entering
the
attic
was
like
going
back
in
time
emerging
in
the
sunlight
and
walking
across
the
lawn
was
a
return
to
the
present
a
promise
of
future
i
cut
the
grass
before
it
gets
hot
he
said
now
patrick
i
want
you
to
keep
track
of
your
time

need
gert
i
mean
if
you
wanted
me

be
different
he

gert
but
he
did
want
to
be
on
call
very
well
patrick
perhaps
you
take
a
glass
of
lemonade
she
often
seemed
amused
by
him
i
will
he
said
he
took
a
nap
in
the
afternoon
and
walked
into
town
refreshed
and
hungry
the
depresso
was
mostly
empty
he
ordered
vegetarian
chili
cornbread
and
a
heineken
thanks
eve
she
smiled
enigmatically
her
mind
elsewhere
she
too
was
from
michigan
like
sue
and
claude
an
odd
coincidence
patrick
had
never
been
in
michigan
but
he
imagined
deep
woods
eve
swayed
like
a
tall
pine
as
she
walked
she
was
older
than
willow
she
had
three
children
patrick
had
seen
one
in
her
arms
and
the
others
swarming
up
her
legs
outside
on
the
patio
she
seemed
to
pace
herself
energy
for
the
kids
energy
for
the
customers
somehow
remaining
beautiful
and
ready
for
more
ready
for
a
different
life
maybe
usually
patrick
could
take
his
eyes
from
her
long
strong
body
but
tonight
he
saw
her
more
completely
a
woman
who
had
to
work
too
hard
dylan
came
out
of
the
kitchen
and
began
to
play
a
low
and
rolling
melody
patrick
felt
an
equality
between
them
dylan
played
the
melody
over
and
over
with
simple
variations
searching
for
something
hunting
in
the
charged
space
between
dylan
music
and
eve
beauty
patrick
thought
about
significant
digits
joe
burke
was
on
to
something
the
rubber
met
the
road
at
significant
digits
mathematics
met
reality
accuracy
significant
accuracy
was
limited
to
the
precision
of
the
worst
measurement
involved
it
did
matter
that
you
could
calculate
an
equation
to
any
number
of
decimal
places
the
answer
could
be
more
accurate
than
the
wobble
the
plus
or
minus
in
the
coarsest
measurement
to
not
understand
this
was
to
think
that
mathematics
was
reality
mathematics
was
a
tool
physical
relationships
that
were
measurable
could
be
expressed
in
equations
but
the
equations
were
models
not
reality
you
had
to
keep
the
distinction
in
mind
or
you
would
think
you
knew
things
more
precisely
than
you
did
dylan
disappeared
into
the
kitchen
and
patrick
ordered
another
beer
models
the
word
expanded
in
his
mind
models
sue
was
a
model
amber
was
a
model
equations
were
models
van
slyke
had
been
a
model
of
what
herself
hendrik
lover
women
in
general
it
was
really
the
painting
that
was
the
model
van
slyke
had
modeled
for
the
model
patrick
mind
began
to
spin
he
continued
his
line
of
thought
mathematics
was
a
tool
for
making
models
so
was
painting
science
and
art
had
that
in
common
they
made
models
of
physical
reality
and
of
a
personal
or
human
reality
it
was
all
about
model
making
got
it
he
looked
around
the
room
got
it
no
one
seemed
to
notice
that
he
had
just
figured
out
a
biggie
probably
they
all
knew
it
already
he
finished
his
beer
and
went
home
leaving
eve
a
big
tip
the
next
morning
he
thought
of
willow
as
he
was
closing
the
front
door
behind
him
chives
were
blooming
by
the
shed
he
picked
a
handful
of
purple
blossoms
and
carried
them
to
ann
deli
top
o
the
mornin
he
said
to
willow
who
was
behind
the
counter
oooh
she
said
chives
she
put
them
in
a
small
glass
with
water
and
set
them
on
the
counter
she
motioned
patrick
to
the
back
of
the
deli
where
she
put
her
arms
around
him
patrick
mmmm
the
hug
was
warm
and
intense
but
there
was
work
a
sandwich
breakfast
good
morning
she
said
happily
letting
him
go
i
need
a
sandwich
got
to
go
to
work
roast
beef
she
made
the
sandwich
while
patrick
chose
a
pint
of
orange
juice
and
a
banana
want
to
meet
me
at
the
depresso
later
he
asked
i
ca
tonight
she
said
oh
he
was
surprised
by
his
disappointment
tomorrow
she
offered
good
around
five
that
was
better
oh
willow
he
turned
in
the
doorway
i
been
thinking
about
science
and
art
again
i
be
brave
she
promised
patrick
skipped
into
the
news
shop
feeling
much
better
parker
put
him
on
a
job
on
the
wittenberg
road
working
with
gino
crew
there
was
a
lot
of
scraping
to
be
done
patrick
rolled
a
bandanna
the
way
wilson
did
and
stripped
to
the
waist
by
break
time
he
was
sweating
and
relaxed
a
large
section
of
one
side
done
parker
passed
out
cups
of
coffee
patrick
ate
his
banana
talk
jumped
from
the
war
to
cars
to
women
to
growing
grass
to
ibm
there
was
an
ibm
plant
in
kingston
it
had
become
a
symbol
of
the
culture
moving
in
a
bad
direction
made
good
money
it
was
conceded
but
they
had
to
wear
white
shirts
and
ties
they
were
considered
sell
outs
one
step
removed
from
robots
gino
told
a
story
about
a
friend
of
his
who
had
struggled
through
a
university
degree
in
engineering
he
was
halfway
through
dropped
out
and
got
drafted
he
also
got
married
but
he
could
live
off
base
until
he
was
finished
with
a
training
program
in
alabama
cleo
his
wife
had
an
apartment
in
town
and
eddie
stayed
too
late
one
night
the
main
gate
closed
he
had
to
be
in
formation
or
whatever
they
call
it
early
in
the
morning
before
he
could
get
back
on
base
gino
sipped
coffee
there
was
a
river
along
one
side
of
the
base
he
walked
into
it
at
night
pitch
black
snakes
alligators
and
started
swimming
he
made
it
gino
shook
his
head
after
he
got
out
of
the
army
he
went
back
to
the
university
and
got
a
job
at
ibm
he
was
until
one
night
at
buckman
eddie
father
is
a
builder
and
some
of
his
crew
were
in
there
they
got
on
him
eddie
like
that
neon
tan
eddie
watch
it
he
hit
you
with
his
slide
rule
so
eddie
had
a
few
beers
went
home
and
said
tan
cleo
that
it
fuck
it
that
was
the
end
of
ibm
for
eddie
doing
great
now
he
building
out
in
california
right
on
pretty
good
catcher
was
he
damned
good
eddie
was
one
of
the
saved
patrick
was
beginning
to
feel
that
way
too
it
was
good
to
be
and
not
have
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
gino
got
to
his
feet
and
stretched
what
a
man
sit
down
gino
no
compassion
it
lonely
at
the
top
gino
said
trudging
toward
a
ladder
that
evening
in
the
depresso
patrick
finished
the
mathematics
book
he
planned
to
mail
it
to
molly
on
saturday
when
he
usually
checked
the
post
office
for
mail
his
parents
and
molly
were
the
only
people
who
wrote
to
him
they
were
used
to
mailing
to
general
delivery
wherever
he
was
living
he
had
given
them
gert
address
and
anyway
summer
was
going
to
last
forever
he
was
sure
how
long
he
be
around
woodstock
willow
he
could
really
think
about
her
she
was
too
new
too
big
or
something
he
felt
the
sweetness
again
and
was
glad
that
they
were
getting
together
the
next
night
patrick
looked
out
the
depresso
window
and
saw
a
red
chevy
convertible
passing
with
its
top
down
willow
was
riding
on
the
passenger
side
her
hair
blowing
martin
willow
so
that
why
she
could
meet
me
he
realized
she
looked
as
though
she
were
having
a
good
time
what
do
i
do
now
he
wondered
the
next
afternoon
willow
was
at
the
depresso
before
him
absorbed
in
a
paperback
hi
there
patrick
said
she
looked
up
and
smiled
hi
patrick
i
brought
my
largest
handkerchief
what
are
you
reading
by
lawrence
durrell
i
saw
you
go
by
with
martin
yesterday
oh
yeah
martin
took
me
for
a
drive
and
showed
me
his
studio
he
has
been
making
recordings
patrick
looked
at
her
directly
and
tried
to
keep
his
face
calm
do
you
like
him
i
do
he
nice
he
asked
me
a
lot
of
questions
he
seemed
to
me
patrick
admitted
patrick
are
you
jealous
umm
tell
you
what
she
said
walk
me
home
tonight
and
i
show
you
how
much
i
like
him
patrick
started
to
smile
it
a
deal
the
sun
came
out
from
behind
a
cloud
willow
covered
his
hand
with
hers
for
a
moment
and
he
felt
reconnected
i
like
you
he
said
now
do
go
overboard
patrick
they
ate
dinner
and
walked
to
byrdcliffe
taking
turns
pushing
bike
amber
was
at
art
they
had
the
house
to
themselves
they
listened
to
dylan
and
finished
a
bottle
of
wine
patrick
undressed
for
bed
with
a
surprising
lack
of
embarrassment
it
seemed
natural
they
clung
to
each
other
and
stayed
awake
late
talking
and
watching
the
new
moon
rise
willow
told
him
about
her
parents
and
her
brother
and
her
dissatisfaction
with
school
if
you
could
do
anything
you
wanted
what
would
you
do
he
asked
her
i
think
i
travel
and
read
a
lot
decide
what
to
do
and
then
do
it
somewhere
but
do
it
right
you
know
yeah
patrick
said
it
the
only
way
babies
too
some
day
speaking
of
which
if
we
going
to
keep
this
up
you
better
get
some
of
those
thingies
patrick
grunted
that
will
be
a
trip
he
said
trojans
right
big
tips
they
do
care
at
the
drug
store
willow
said
very
big
tips
only
for
you
patrick
said
exactly
they
had
to
hurry
in
the
morning
to
get
to
the
deli
in
time
patrick
took
his
sandwich
to
the
news
shop
ate
breakfast
and
rode
to
the
wittenberg
job
with
wilson
when
he
thought
of
willow
during
the
day
he
felt
easy
and
excited
at
the
same
time
he
could
actually
talk
to
her
she
understood
immediately
his
point
that
science
and
art
were
modeling
processes
better
yet
she
saw
that
modeling
itself
was
fundamental
an
attempt
to
understand
what
was
out
there
and
express
it
with
whatever
tools
you
could
use
sleeping
with
her
was
so
great
sex
just
the
comfort
of
being
next
to
her
it
was
such
a
new
experience
that
he
would
forget
for
an
hour
and
then
remember
with
a
rush
of
pleasure
there
was
a
police
car
in
front
of
gert
when
wilson
dropped
him
off
after
work
what
happening
patrick
asked
you
staying
here
yes

the
cop
wrote
his
name
down
in
a
small
notebook
willett
been
taken
to
the
hospital
he
said
oh
no
patrick
said
sick
heart
attack
maybe
the
cop
said
where
is
the
hospital
kingston
damn
patrick
said
hope
for
the
best
the
cop
said
putting
his
notebook
away
all
you
can
do
she
been
around
here
a
long
time
patrick
went
inside
the
house
felt
empty
there
was
only
one
other
roomer
at
the
moment
a
middle
aged
guy
who
kept
to
himself
a
high
school
teacher
from
the
city
apparently
he
spent
a
month
in
woodstock
every
summer
bob
he
was
around
patrick
washed
and
walked
into
town
he
finished
a
beer
quickly
and
checked
the
crowd
gathering
in
the
depresso
claude
was
at
the
end
of
the
bar
patrick
approached
him

the
morning
patrick
left
and
started
up
the
truck
three
minutes
later
he
was
passing
the
golf
course
heading
for
kingston
on
route
kingston
hospital
was
easy
to
find
but
gert
was
there
he
drove
into
the
general
area
where
he
thought
he
find
the
benedictine
trying
to
remember
claude
directions
he
was
about
to
stop
and
ask
when
he
saw
it
on
a
hill
gert
had
been
admitted
patrick
explained
the
situation
and
was
allowed
to
see
her
but
only
for
a
minute
or
two
she
was
pale
and
looked
fragile
an
oxygen
tube
crossed
her
face
below
her
nose
patrick
went
up
close
hi
gert
she
raised
her
eyebrows
in
greeting
and
whispered
something
he
could
hear
he
bent
closer
call
ginger
patrick
nodded
and
said
i
will
ginger
was
her
niece
she
lived
in
louis
patrick
yes

chest
treasure
chest
do
let
her
see

of

but

she
smiled
faintly
and
shook
her
head
no

love
she
whispered
for
a
moment
she
looked
young
i
take
care
of
it
gert
she
nodded
and
closed
her
eyes
patrick
left
stepping
carefully
around
monitors
he
thanked
the
nurse
and
went
out
to
the
parking
lot
it
was
still
light
an
ambulance
pulled
up
to
an
admissions
door
it
did
seem
right
that
things
outside
should
be
so
normal
he
sat
unmoving
for
five
minutes
and
then
realized
that
he
was
hungry
the
park
diner
was
on
the
way
out
of
kingston
heading
towards
woodstock
when
patrick
was
upset
he
ate
to
settle
himself
down
he
had
a
steak
sandwich
apple
pie
and
coffee
he
was
still
in
shock
how
could
someone
be
running
around
one
day
and
then
be
totaled
the
next
probably
she
was
older
than
she
looked
damn
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
home
and
call
her
niece
climbing
the
hill
to
the
village
green
patrick
had
an
urge
to
drive
to
willow
but
he
decided
against
it
he
had
to
call
gert
niece
and
it
was
his
truck
he
parked
behind
mower
market
and
walked
directly
home
he
found
the
number
in
a
small
book
that
gert
kept
by
the
phone
ginger
yes
this
is
patrick
calling
from
woodstock
i
hate
to
tell
you
this
but
gert
is
in
the
hospital
ginger
said
that
she
would
come
as
soon
as
possible
she
thanked
him
and
hung
up
what
else
could
he
do
he
left
a
note
for
bob
explaining
the
situation
and
walked
back
into
town
he
kept
seeing
gert
that
clear
shake
of
her
head
no
claude
had
left
the
depresso
patrick
reconsidered
driving
to
willow
and
again
decided
that
he
should
he
drank
a
beer
and
went
home
as
he
settled
into
bed
he
realized
that
even
though
he
had
seen
willow
she
had
been
there
in
some
sense
he
could
have
seen
her
if
he
had
she
would
have
been
helpful
thinking
of
that
was
as
good
as
having
her
next
to
him
in
bed
but
it
was
still
good
more
than
he
was
used
to
night
baby
he
said
and
fell
asleep
willow
brought
home
strawberries
and
made
a
shortcake
real
whipped
cream

of

reached
into
the
refrigerator

her
lips

champagne

a
revelation

patrick
patrick

whole

she
said
let
this
be
a
formal
announcement
i
hereby
renounce
stanford
and
the
privileges
associated
thereunto
and
all
obligation
to
write
useless
papers
and
all
requirements
to
be
stuck
in
crowded
rooms
with
people
who
are
dumb
bored
or
lying
how
sweet
of
you
amber
said
present
company
excepted
of
course
i
would
think
long
and
hard
on
this
one
amber
said
it
the
privileges
part
and
your
family
will
freak
out
what
are
you
going
to
do
willow
put
on
the
stereo
that
it
she
said
that
the
point
i
do
know
what
i
going
to
do
but
i
going
to
find
out
i
going
to
do
what
i
want
and
not
what
someone
else
wants
is
it
patrick
has
he
caused
you
to
lose
your
mind
completely
amber
smiled
as
she
asked
and
willow
saw
that
amber
had
already
accepted
this
new
reality
and
was
being
a
good
friend
playing
devil
advocate
it
about
finding
my
mind
amber
came
over
and
hugged
her
i
make
enough
for
both
of
us
she
said
willow
felt
a
weight
lift
from
her
shoulders
she
had
been
thinking
about
this
all
day
but
it
had
felt
real
until
she
told
amber
it
was
as
though
a
door
opened
a
breeze
blew
around
the
back
of
her
mind
and
the
light
was
brighter
she
began
to
cry
hold
that
door
she
said
hold
the
bottle
is
what
i
hold
amber
said
squeezing
her
they
each
knew
that
they
had
come
to
a
fork
in
the
road
and
that
the
distance
between
them
would
inevitably
broaden
they
talked
late
into
the
night
amber
volunteered
to
reassure
willow
parents
when
she
returned
to
california
and
willow
promised
to
write
letters
from
the
wild
world
willow
went
to
bed
tired
but
feeling
honest
and
sure
of
herself
a
new
ball
game
squirrelie
she
said
turning
her
head
toward
the
woods
in
the
morning
she
waited
anxiously
for
patrick
in
the
deli
she
rehearsed
various
greetings
but
when
he
came
through
the
door
she
took
one
look
and
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
gert
is
in
the
hospital
oh
no
your
nice
landlady
patrick
nodded
is
it
serious
patrick
raised
his
arms
and
let
out
a
breath
yes
he
said
i
called
her
niece
in
louis
she
coming
today
i
think
i
need
a
sandwich
maybe
we
could
meet
later
sure
i
be
at
the
depresso
if
you
do
show
up
i
figure
you
could
make
it
he
looked
relieved
she
made
him
an
enormous
sandwich
and
wished
that
she
could
hug
him
but
another
customer
was
waiting
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
patrick
sad
his
expression
was
calm
resigned
almost
delicate
the
energy
she
was
accustomed
to
seeing
in
his
face
seemed
to
have
drawn
back
turned
inward
as
though
it
were
trained
on
maintaining
his
balance
i
hope
i
see
you
later
she
said
his
answering
smile
included
her
in
his
balance
if
that
what
it
was
she
felt
more
certain
than
ever
that
she
was
moving
in
the
right
direction
on
her
way
home
she
stopped
to
talk
with
ahnree
who
was
seated
in
a
director
chair
on
his
lawn
he
was
sketching
an
apple
tree
nice
day
huh
ahnree
mmm
yes
willow
pretty
she
pointed
at
the
drawing
i
thought
you
only
painted
women
ahnree
looked
up
from
his
labor
one
must
take
a
break
occasionally
it
is
good
for
the
eye
he
selected
another
colored
pencil
and
rubbed
a
few
darker
patches
into
the
ground
beneath
the
tree
tone
willow
yes
tone
normally
she
would
have
continued
on
her
way
at
this
point
hell
normally
she
would
have
waved
and
not
stopped
in
the
first
place
ahnree
put
down
his
pencil
carefully
and
are
you
content
here
willow
a
bit
surprising
sometimes
ahnree
i
am
she
said
emphatically
i
love
the
flowers
it
is
a
wonderful
place
pour
ahnree
smiled
god
this
blushing
had
to
stop
right
she
said
patrick
she
added
ah
patrick
is
he
the
one
with
the
red
hair
yes
marvelous
ahnree
said
looking
back
at
the
apple
tree
ahnree
he
looked
back
at
her
amber
said
that
you
said
i
might
use
your
piano
some
time
of
course
willow
of
course
amber
told
me
that
you
were
musical
he
rubbed
his
stomach
i
am
often
out
in
the
middle
of
the
day
just
let
yourself
in
thanks
ahnree
you
are
a
sweetheart
no
matter
what
they
say
about
you
at
the
museum
of
modern
art
his
face
darkened
those
idiots
just
kidding
she
skipped
away
he
was
decent
really
she
pedaled
to
the
studio
ate
a
carrot
that
was
getting
old
cut
up
an
apple
and
ate
that
with
a
piece
of
cheddar
and
made
a
mug
of
tea
which
she
balanced
on
her
stomach
as
she
lay
on
her
bed
she
did
have
a
violin
and
she
was
sure
what
she
be
getting
into
if
she
started
going
over
to
tom
merrill
she
played
piano
well
enough
to
fool
around
to
maybe
get
at
what
she
was
feeling
her
eyes
closed
and
without
opening
them
she
lowered
the
half
empty
mug
to
the
stone
floor
an
hour
later
she
brushed
her
hair
and
put
on
a
slinky
black
she
folded
a
sweater
weighed
it
down
with
a
book
in
the
bike
basket
and
coasted
down
the
mountain
her
favorite
table
was
empty
a
good
sign
she
ordered
a
beer
and
put
the
book
on
the
table
but
she
did
not
read
it
preferring
to
watch
cars
and
people
pass
by
enjoying
a
feeling
of
community
i
mean
i
live
here
she
thought
i
not
going
back
the
words
still
thrilled
her
patrick
arrived
minutes
later
looking
pretty
much
as
he
had
in
the
morning
how
are
ya
she
asked
not
wanting
to
throw
herself
at
him
thirsty
gert
died
damn
yeah
this
morning
i
just
called
she
pushed
her
bottle
in
his
direction
and
watched
him
take
two
long
swallows
thanks
he
said
ginger
that
her
niece
is
supposed
to
arrive
tonight
she
staying
at
the
house
so
i
said
i
be
there
i
sorry
patrick
i
am
too
i
keep
seeing
gert
lying
in
that
hospital
bed
all
alone
he
paused
strange
thing
happened
she
asked
me
not
to
let
her
niece
have
a
chest
that
was
in
the
attic
it
was
like
her
last
wish
she
said
the
chest
was
hers
my
love
she
said
she
was
whispering
i
could
barely
hear
her
when
she
said
it
her
face
changed
and
she
looked
like
a
girl
oh
patrick
she
seemed
almost
happy
i
think
she
was
happy
maybe
she
was
so
alone
willow
said
patrick
spread
his
hands
palms
up
anyway
i
promised
about
the
chest
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
she
asked
thanks
eve
patrick
took
his
beer
and
considered
go
home
i
guess
wait
what
about
the
chest
is
it
big
not
very
patrick
said
could
you
hide
it
somewhere
i
guess
i
could
put
it
under
my
bed
and
pretend
that
it
was
mine
but
the
niece
may
have
seen
it
before
you
right
patrick
said
you
could
put
it
under
the
bed
with
a
garbage
bag
around
it
just
to
hide
it
then
we
could
figure
out
how
to
move
it
later
bring
it
up
to
my
house
or
take
it
to
the
dump
i
do
know
about
the
dump
patrick
said
it
would
be
like
throwing
her
away
no
dump
willow
said
the
garbage
bag
is
a
good
idea
that
what
i
do
so
he
stood
i
miss
you
love
that
he
meant
what
was
underneath
she
wiggled
in
her
chair
pleased
i
got
the
day
off
tomorrow
she
told
him
i
love
to
see
you
good
deal
here
after
work
they
agreed
and
she
watched
him
leave
walking
slowly
she
wanted
to
tell
him
about
her
decision
but
he
had
a
lot
on
his
mind
it
could
wait
until
tomorrow
also
that
would
give
her
another
day
to
make
sure
it
was
for
real
she
knew
it
was
but
it
would
hurt
to
sleep
on
it
one
more
night
in
the
morning
she
wrote
to
the
dean
at
stanford
requesting
a
leave
of
absence
willow
clara
brown
she
signed
it
it
my
name
damnit
she
said
to
herself
every
one
has
always
called
me
i
help
it
if
dad
is
a
brahms
freak
i
mean
there
nothing
wrong
with
clara
but
willow
is
my
name
she
was
working
herself
up
to
call
home
writing
the
letter
first
made
the
decision
more
of
a
fait
accompli
even
though
she
had
mailed
it
she
rode
her
bike
into
town
and
dropped
the
letter
through
the
slot
inside
the
post
office
that
that
she
said
and
felt
better

from

her
mother

i
requested
a
leave
of

willow
waited
your

after

had
his

silence
willow
braced
for
where
did
we
go
wrong
and
what
the
matter
with
stanford
baby

sure
the
sure
came
from
a
deep

with
a
similar
place
in
willow

believe
it

actually
talked
to
me
like

far
out
amber
said
i

good
idea
willow
jumped
to
her
feet
and
paced
the
room
but
my
father
i
ca
send

to
her
and
not
say
anything
to

this

willow
said
before
i
meet
patrick
she
wrote
a
short
note
to
go
with
the
album
her
father
would
be
relieved
to
know
that
she
had
requested
a
leave
of
absence
and
would
be
in
good
standing
at
the
university
she
told
him
that
she
needed
time
to
find
her
own
direction
he
would
think
that
she
was
making
a
mistake
but
at
least
he
would
hear
it
from
her
directly
and
would
recognize
that
she
was
serious
she
added
that
there
was
a
guy
in
town
who
played
piano
like
fats
waller
love
willow
she
rode
back
to
the
village
and
ordered
flowers
for
her
mother
the
book
and
record
shop
packaged
the
dylan
album
for
her
she
slipped
in
the
note
and
made
her
second
trip
of
the

post
office

to
the
depresso

patrick
said
when

slowly
across
patrick
face
what

you
going
to
do

you
dinner
at
deanie
patrick
was
surprisingly
formal
at
dinner
he
ordered
carefully
and
ate
slowly
looking
around
the
restaurant
with
pleasure
what
a
sweetie
willow
could
get
over
how
comfortable
she
felt
this
was
like

good
place
to
be
i

it

be
fun
here
in
the
winter
she
said
a
lot

patrick
said
they
were
agreeing
without
actually
discussing
it
to
spend
the
winter
together
patrick
walked
her
all
the
way
home
and
then
walked
back
after
a
long
hug
which
stayed
with
her
as
she
slipped
beneath
her
covers
on
the
porch
how
good
is
this
she
asked
herself
very
good
as
she
and
patrick
passed
through
town
a
voice
had
come
out
of
a
doorway
patrick
old
buddy

up
the
street

billy
behind

believe
it
when
i
saw
you
at
the
school
it
so
weird
cree
said
it
seems
like
yesterday
we
were
sitting
around
in
woodstock
and
then
in
another
way
it
seems
like
forever
i
brought
you
something
willow
handed
a
sheet
of
paper
to
cree
patrick
got
in
touch
with
gino
last
year
and
gino
sent
this
to
him
i
copied
it
for
you
aesthetic
muses
too
are
easily
bored
and
sometimes
prefer
a
tickle
to
a
grand
assault
you
have
filled
the
cathedral
with
flowers
organist
and
choirmaster
poised
you
stand
there
expectant
dressed
in
your
best
suit
you
may
find
that
yawning
somnolent
with
incense
she
has
slipped
away
around
the
corner
to
a
restaurant
where
a
painter
having
sketched
the
waiter
on
a
paper
napkin
uses
it
to
blot
the
marinara
sauce
from
his
blue
silk
tie
cree
read
and
wrinkled
her
nose
that
gino
all
right
i
think
happy
in
the
maine
woods
his
relationship
is
good
he
does
make
any
money
but
what
else
is
new
she
shook
her
head
well
we
got
bart
made
anyway
go
bart
willow
said
so
how
your
business
every
time
i
think
it
going
to
die
it
surprises
me
and
comes
back
to
life
must
be
fun
going
to
italy
on
buying
trips
it
is
fun
sometimes
and
deductible
how
does
patrick
like
it
at
the
university
he
enjoys
it
willow
said
he
likes
the
research
best
but
he
does
mind
the
teaching
the
kids
love
him
of
course
they
do
cree
said
now
i
trying
to
remember
you
into
music
i
was
i
mean
i
am
i
love
it
but
i
do
perform
or
anything
bart
is
pretty
good
on
the
piano
i
thinking
of
changing
to
a
better
teacher
i
grew
up
on
lessons
willow
said
i
think
i
had
too
many
when
i
was
in
woodstock
i
used
to
go
up
to
ahnree
and
play
his
piano
try
to
write
songs
i
found
that
i
could
it
was
a
great
disappointment
it
was
like
i
was
too
grooved
in
the
classical
i
could
get
loose
could
get
away
from
it
i
guess
if
i
were
really
talented
i
would
have
blown
it
off
and
done
my
own
thing
she
paused
i
would
push
it
too
hard
nudge
maybe
scone
cree
face
lit
up
as
she
bit
into
the
scone
mighty
fine
she
said
that
what
i
do
best
willow
said
it
a
wonder
i
can
still
see
my
feet
i
starting
a
cafe
in
january
spectacular
i
be
there
you
look
terrific
i
the
blimp
think
about
the
music
lessons
thanks
willow
they
watched
the
mustangs
struggle
the
other
team
was
doing
most
of
the
attacking
what
your
little
one
like
dylan
right
after
bob
willow
said
he
more
even
tempered
than
martin
but
he
pretty
intense
quiet
he
got
a
thing
for
cats
which
i
take
to
be
a
good
sign
the
attackers
lined
up
for
a
corner
kick
what
ever
happened
to
joe
burke
oh
joe
cree
smiled
he
was
something
he
and
sally
went
to
hawaii
to
live
then
they
broke
up
he
in
maine
they
had
a
daughter
remarried
i
think
he
was
interesting
willow
said
yeah
if
the
situation
had
been
a
little
different
she
raised
one
eyebrow
i
do
think
he
ever
found
a
place
where
he
fit
in
the
good
old
days
cree
said
when
you
showed
up
in
woodstock
you
had
a
friend
amber
willow
said
was
she
from
the
bay
area
yep
she
in
vancouver
washington
now
she
a
pediatrician
she
married
a
developer
with
pots
of
money
they
have
two
spoiled
kids
she
was
gorgeous
cree
said
she
hanging
in
there
willow
said
a
line
of
men
was
following
her
around
in
the
mall
the
last
time
i
saw
her
men
cree
shook
her
head
they
come
in
handy
at
a
picnic
as
my
mother
used
to
say
you
got
the
last
good
one
patrick
is
a
sweetie
as
long
as
you
put
the
pliers
back
jesus
willow
said
there
was
a
great
commotion
from
the
attackers
as
they
ran
back
towards
their
own
goal
holding
their
arms
in
the
air
mustangs
down
oh
dear
we
will
conquer
cree
said
martin
going
to
be
upset
he
planning
to
be
a
world
cup
goalie
he
carries
himself
like
patrick
where
did
the
name
come
from
my
father

is
martin
and
also
you
got
to
keep
this
to
yourself
cree

closer

you
remember
martin
merrill
in
woodstock
lived
on
the
byrdcliffe
road
played
banjo
and
fiddle

said
he
was
around
a
lot
he
had
a
glamorous
mother
right
right
willow
sipped
coffee
one
night
patrick
and
i
were
in
the
depresso
about
a
week
before
we
left
town
we
decided
to
get
married
and
move
to
tallahassee
so
patrick
could
go
back
to
school
we
were
celebrating
martin
came
in
and
we
told
him
our
plans
he
was
happy
about
it
and
said
he
had
a
wedding
present
for
us
patrick
said
to
him
present
all
right
we
do
even
have
a
date
i
said

patrick
said
parents
already
fear
the
worst
i
said

to
call
my
father
patrick
said
well
when
patrick
said
that
martin
leaned
across
the
table
mean
our
father
do
you
i
thought
patrick
was
going
to
fall
off
his
chair
his
mouth
opened
and
nothing
came
out
it
easy
martin
said
no
big
deal
hell

heard
my
mom
talking
she
and
her
best
friend
were
drinking
they
thought
i

asleep
she
never
said
anything
i
guess
she
was
worried
that
the
family
would
throw
her
out
or
disown
her
or
something
martin
looked
sad
remember
things
like
that
when
you

there
was
something
similar
about
you

i
said
patrick
held
his
hands
across
the
table
extending
his
fingers
hands
he
said
martin
spread
his
fingers
to
compare

they
clasped
hands

a
moment
figured

said
of
the
way
you
kept
watching
me
