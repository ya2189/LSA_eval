george
wotton
gently
pushing
the
swing
doors
of
the
public
bar
of
the
king
head
an
inch
apart
applied
an
eye
to
the
aperture
in
the
hope
of
discovering
a
moneyed
friend
his
gaze
fell
on
the
only
man
in
the
bar
a
greybeard
of
sixty
whose
face
and
rough
clothing
spoke
of
the
sea
with
a
faint
sigh
he
widened
the
opening
and
passed
through
mornin
ben
he
said
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness

a
drop
with
me
said
the
other
heartily
got
any
money
about

wotton
shook
his
head
and
his
face
fell
clearing
somewhat
as
the
other
handed
him
his
mug
drink
it
all
up
george
he
said
his
friend
complied
a
more
tactful
man
might
have
taken
longer
over
the
job
but
benjamin
davis
who
appeared
to
be
labouring
under
some
strong
excitement
took
no
notice
i
had
a
shock
george
he
said
regarding
the
other
steadily

news
of
my
old
woman

said
wotton
calmly
wot

said
davis
solemnly
she

i
went
off
to
sea
one
fine
morning
and
that
was
the
last
i
ever
see

wotton
with
mild
interest
no
said
his
friend
but
i
did
we
been
married
three
years
three
long
years
and
i
had
enough
of
it
awful
temper
she
had
the
last
words
i
ever
heard
say
was
that
wotton
took
up
the
mug
and
after
satisfying
himself
as
to
the
absence
of
contents
put
it
down
again
and
yawned
i
should
worry
about
it
if
i
was
you
he
remarked
she
hardly
likely
to
find
you
now
and
if
she
does
she
wo
get
much
davis
gave
vent
to
a
contemptuous
laugh
get
much
he
repeated
it
her
what
got
it
i
met
a
old
shipmate
of
mine
this
morning
what
i
seen
for
ten
years
and
he
told
me

acrost
only
a
month
ago
after
she
left
me
but
you
said

exclaimed
his
listening
friend
same
thing
said
davis
impatiently
after
she
left
me
to
work
myself
to
death
at
sea
running
here
and
there
at
the
orders
of
a
pack
scuts
aft
she
went
into
service
and
stayed
in
one
place
for
fifteen
years
then

for
twenty
years
while

been
working
myself
to

and
bone

living
in
comfort
and
idleness
lines
said
wotton
shaking
his
head
it
do
bear
thinking
of
why
did
she
advertise
for
me
said
davis
raising
his
voice
that
what
i
want
to
know
advertisements
is
cheap
enough
why
she
advertise
i
should
come
at
once
if
she
said
anything
about
money
wotton
shook
his
head
again
she
did
want

he
said
slowly
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
demanded
the
other
it
was
dooty

his
friend

along
time
and
she
has
lost
love
for

those
days
yes

davis
i

much
what
about

that
ai
the
question

other

a
home
and
money
it
do
matter
about

my
advice
you
wo

of

away
from
her
say
you
was
cast
away
at
sea
and
when
you
came
back
years
afterwards
you
could
find
her
davis
pondered
for
some
time
in
sulky
silence
it
would
be
as
well
he
said
at
last
but
i
stand
no
nonsense
mind
if
you
like
i
come
with
you
said
wotton
i
ai
got
nothing
to
do
i
could
tell
i
was
cast
away
with
you
if
you
liked
anything
to
help
a
pal
davis
took
two
inches
of
soiled
clay
pipe
from
his
pocket
and
puffed
thoughtfully
you
can
come
he
said
at
last
if
you
only
got
a
copper
or
two
we
could
ride
it
down
clapham
way
wotton
smiled
feebly
and
after
going
carefully
through
his
pockets
shook
his
head
and
followed
his
friend
outside
i
wonder
whether
she
be
pleased
he
remarked
as
they
walked
slowly
along
she
might
be
women
are
funny
creatures
so
faithful
i
knew
one
whose
husband
used
to
knock
about
dreadful
and
after
he
died
she
was
so
true
to
his
memory
she
would
marry
again
davis
grunted
and
with
a
longing
eye
at
the
omnibuses
passing
over
london
bridge
asked
a
policeman
the
distance
to
clapham
never
mind
said
wotton
as
his
friend
uttered
an
exclamation
you
have
money
in
your
pocket
soon
davis
face
brightened
and
a
watch
and
chain
too
he
said
and
smoke
your
cigar
of
a
sunday
said
wotton
and
have
a
chair
and
a
glass
for
a
friend
davis
almost
smiled
and
then
suddenly
remembering
his
wasted
twenty
years
shook
his
head
grimly
over
the
friendship
that
attached
itself
to
and
glasses
of
ale
and
said
that
there
was
plenty
of
it
about
more
friendship
than
glasses
of
ale
and
perhaps
at
clapham
they
inquired
the
way
of
a
small
boy
and
after
following
the
road
indicated
retraced
their
steps
cheered
by
a
faint
but
bloodthirsty
hope
of
meeting
him
again
a
friendly
baker
put
them
on
the
right
track
at
last
both
gentlemen
eyeing
the
road
with
a
mixture
of
concern
and
delight
it
was
a
road
of
trim
villas
each
with
a
front
garden
and
curtained
windows
at
the
gate
of
a
house
with
the
word
blairgowrie
inscribed
in
huge
gilt
letters
on
the
fanlight
davis
paused
for
a
moment
uneasily
and
then
walking
up
the
path
followed
by
wotton
knocked
at
the
door
he
retired
a
step
in
disorder
before
the
apparition
of
a
maid
in
cap
and
apron
a
sharp
not
sounded
in
his
ears
and
the
door
closed
again
he
faced
his
friend
gasping
i
should
give
her
the
sack
first
thing
said
wotton
davis
knocked
again
and
again
the
maid
reappeared
and
after
surveying
them
through
the
glass
opened
the
door
a
little
way
and
parleyed
i
want
to
see
your
missis
said
davis
fiercely
what
for
demanded
the
girl
you
tell
said
davis
inserting
his
foot
just
in
time
you
tell
that
there
two
gentlemen
here
what
have
brought
news
of
her
husband
and
look
sharp
about
it
they
was
cast
away
with
said
wotton
on
a
desert
island
said
davis
he
pushed
his
way
in
followed
by
his
friend
and
a
head
that
had
been
leaning
over
the
banisters
was
suddenly
withdrawn
for
a
moment
he
stood
irresolute
in
the
tiny
passage
and
then
with
a
husband
boldness
he
entered
the
front
room
and
threw
himself
into
an
wotton
after
a
scared
glance
around
the
room
seated
himself
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
most
uncomfortable
chair
he
could
find
and
coughed
nervously
illustration
you
tell
that
there
two
gentlemen
here
what
have
brought
news
of
her
husband
better
not
be
too
sudden
with
her
he
whispered
you
do
want
her
to
faint
or
anything
of
that
sort
do
let
know
who
you
are
at
first
let
her
find
it
out
for
herself
davis
who
was
also
suffering
from
the
stiff
grandeur
of
his
surroundings
nodded
you
better
start
in
case
she
reckernizes
my
voice
he
said
slowly
pitch
it
in
strong
about
me
and
i
was
always
wondering
what
had
to
her
you
in
luck
that
wot
you
are
said
his
friend
enviously
only
seen
furniture
like
thiss
in
shop
windows
before
here
she
comes
he
started
and
both
men
tried
to
look
at
their
ease
as
a
stiff
rustling
sounded
from
the
stairs
then
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
old
lady
with
white
hair
swept
into
the
room
and
stood
regarding
them
davis
unprepared
for
the
changes
wrought
by
years
stared
at
her
aghast
the
black
silk
dress
the
gold
and
huge
cameo
brooch
did
not
help
to
reassure
him
afternoon
said
wotton
in
a
thin
voice
the
old
lady
returned
the
greeting
and
crossing
to
a
chair
and
seating
herself
in
a
very
upright
fashion
regarded
him
calmly
we
we
called
to
see
you
about
a
dear
old
pal
friend
i
mean
continued
wotton
one
o
the
best
the
best
yes
said
the
old
lady
he
been
missing
said
wotton
watching
closely
for
any
symptoms
of
fainting
for
years
years
much
against
his
left
young
and
handsome
wife
to
go
for
a
sea
and
was
shipwrecked
and
cast
away
on
a
desert
island
yes
said
the
old
lady
again
i
was
cast
away
with
said
wotton
both
of
us
was
cast
away
with
him
he
indicated
davis
with
his
hand
and
the
old
lady
after
a
glance
at
that
gentleman
turned
to
wotton
again
we
was
on
that
island
for
longer
than
i
like
to
think
of
continued
wotton
who
had
a
wholesome
dread
of
dates
but
we
was
rescued
at
last
and
ever
since
then
he
has
been
hunting
high
and
low
for
his
wife
it
very
interesting
murmured
the
old
lady
but
what
has
it
got
to
do
with
me
wotton
gasped
and
cast
a
helpless
glance
at
his
friend
you
ai
heard
his
name
yet
he
said
impressively
wot
would
you
say
if
i
said
it
was
ben
davis
i
should
say
it
was
true
said
the
old
lady
promptly
not
true
said
wotton
catching
his
breath
painfully
wish
i
may
die
about
the
desert
island
continued
the
old
lady
calmly
the
story
that
i
heard
was
that
he
went
off
like
a
cur
and
left
his
young
wife
to
do
the
best
she
could
for
herself
i
suppose
he
heard
since
that
she
has
come
in
for
a
bit
of
money
money
repeated
wotton
in
a
voice
that
he
fondly
hoped
expressed
artless
surprise
money
money
said
the
old
lady
and
i
suppose
he
sent
you
two
gentlemen
round
to
see
how
the
land
lay
she
was
looking
full
at
davis
as
she
spoke
and
both
men
began
to
take
a
somewhat
sombre
view
of
the
situation
you
did
know
him
else
you
would
talk
like
that
said
wotton
i
do
suppose
you
know
if
you
was
to
see
him
now
i
do
suppose
i
should
said
the
other
you
reckernize
his
voice
said
davis
breaking
silence
at
last
wotton
held
his
breath
but
the
old
lady
merely
shook
her
head
thoughtfully
it
was
a
disagreeable
voice
when
his
wife
used
to
hear
it
she
said
at
last
always
when
it
was
swearing
wotton
glanced
at
his
friend
and
raising
his
eyebrows
slightly
gave
up
his
task
might
ha
been
faults
on
both
sides
said
davis
gruffly
you
were
all
that
you
should
ha
been
you
know
me
said
his
hostess
raising
her
voice
illustration
do
you
know
me
mary
yes
you
said
davis
rising
do
you
know
me
mary
why
i
knew
you
the
moment
you
come
into
the
room
he
moved
towards
her
awkwardly
but
she
rose
in
her
turn
and
drew
back
if
you
touch
me
i
scream
she
said
firmly
how
dare
you
why
i
never
seen
you
before
in
my
life
it
ben
davis
it
right
enough
said
wotton
meekly
hold
your
tongue
said
the
old
lady
look
at
me
commanded
davis
sternly
look
at
me
straight
in
the
eye
do
talk
nonsense
said
the
other
sharply
look
you
in
the
eye
indeed
i
do
want
to
look
in
your
eye
what
would
people
think
let
think
wot
they
like
said
davis
recklessly
this
is
a
nice
after
being
away
years
most
of
it
on
a
desert
island
put
in
wotton
pathetically
and
now
i
come
back
resumed
davis
come
back
to
stop
he
hung
his
cap
on
a
vase
on
the
mantelpiece
that
reeled
under
the
shock
and
dropping
into
his
chair
again
crossed
his
legs
and
eyed
her
sternly
her
gaze
was
riveted
on
his
dilapidated
boots
she
looked
up
and
spoke
mildly
you
not
my
husband
she
said
you
made
a
mistake
i
think
you
had
better
go
ho
said
davis
with
a
hard
laugh
indeed
and
do
you
know
i
not
for
the
best
of
reasons
was
the
reply
besides
how
can
you
prove
that
you
are
years
is
a
long
time
on
a
desert
island
said
wotton
rapidly
you
be
surprised
slow
the
time
passes
i
was
there
with
and
i
can
lay
my
hand
on
my
and
assure
you
that
that
is
your
husband
nonsense
said
the
old
lady
vigorously
rubbish
i
can
prove
it
said
davis
fixing
her
with
a
glittering
eye
do
you
remember
the
serpent
i
tattooed
on
my
leg
for
a
garter
if
you
do
go
at
once
said
the
old
lady
hastily
i
send
for
the
police
you
used
to
admire
it
said
davis
reproachfully
i
remember
once
if
you
say
another
word
said
the
other
in
a
fierce
voice
i
send
straight
off
for
the
police
you
and
your
serpents
i
tell
my
husband
of
you
that
what
i
do
your
what
roared
davis
springing
to
his
feet
my
husband
he
wo
stand
any
of
your
nonsense
i
can
tell
you
better
go
before
he
comes
in
said
davis
taking
a
long
breath
oh
so
you
been
and
got
married
again
you
that
your
love
for
your
husband
as
was
cast
away
while
trying
to
earn
a
living
for
you
that
why
you
do
want
me
is
it
we
see
i
wait
for
him
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
said
the
other
with
great
dignity
i
only
been
married
once
davis
passed
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
eyes
in
a
dazed
fashion
and
stared
at
her
is
is
somebody
passing
himself
off
as
me
he
demanded
if
he
is
i
you
both
up
for
bigamy
certainly
not
but
but
davis
turned
and
looked
blankly
at
his
friend
wotton
met
his
gaze
with
dilated
eyes
you
say
you
recognize
me
as
your
wife
said
the
old
lady
certainly
said
davis
hotly
it
very
curious
said
the
other
very
but
are
you
sure
look
again
davis
thrust
his
face
close
to
hers
and
stared
hard
she
bore
his
scrutiny
without
flinching
i
positive
certain
said
davis
taking
a
breath
that
very
curious
said
the
old
lady
but
then
i
suppose
we
are
a
bit
alike
you
see
davis
being
away
i
looking
after
her
house
for
a
bit
my
name
happens
to
be
smith
davis
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
and
falling
back
a
step
stared
at
her
we
all
make
mistakes
urged
wotton
after
a
long
silence
and
ben
sight
ai
wot
it
used
to
be
he
strained
it
looking
out
for
a
sail
when
we
was
on
that
desert
when
when
she
be
back
inquired
davis
finding
his
voice
at
last
the
old
lady
affected
to
look
puzzled
but
i
thought
you
were
certain
that
i
was
your
wife
she
said
smoothly
my
mistake
said
davis
ruefully
years
is
a
long
time
and
people
change
a
bit
i
have
myself
for
one
thing
i
must
say
i
did
expect
to
find
so
stout
stout
repeated
the
other
quickly
not
that
i
mean
you
too
stout
said
davis
hurriedly
for
people
that
like
stoutness
that
is
my
wife
used
to
a
very
good
figger
wotton
nodded
he
used
to
rave
about
it
on
that
des
when
will
she
be
back
inquired
davis
interrupting
him
smith
shook
her
head
i
ca
say
she
replied
moving
towards
the
door
when
she
off
holidaying
i
never
know
when
she
return
shall
i
tell
her
you
called
tell
her
i
certainly
said
davis
with
great
vehemence
come
in
a
week
time
and
see
if
she
back
she
might
be
away
for
months
said
the
old
lady
moving
slowly
to
the
passage
and
opening
the
street
door
she
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
stood
watching
them
through
the
glass
as
they
passed
disconsolately
into
the
street
then
she
went
back
into
the
parlour
and
standing
before
the
mantelpiece
looked
long
and
earnestly
into
the
mirror
davis
returned
a
week
later
alone
and
pausing
at
the
gate
glanced
in
dismay
at
a
bill
in
the
window
announcing
that
the
house
was
to
be
sold
he
walked
up
the
path
still
looking
at
it
and
being
admitted
by
the
trim
servant
was
shown
into
the
parlour
and
stood
in
a
dispirited
fashion
before
smith
not
back
yet
he
inquired
gruffly
the
old
lady
shook
her
head
what
what
is
that
bill
for
demanded
davis
jerking
his
thumb
towards
it
she
is
thinking
of

house

smith

the
result

inquired
davis
frowning
smith
shook
her
head
again
and
it
would
be

telling
you
she
said
what
she
has
got
is
her
own
and
the
law
wo

touch
a
penny
of
it
without
her
consent
you
must
have
treated
her
badly

davis
why

hit
me
over
the

head

davis

the
old
lady

the
other

he
leaned
forward
and
holding
his
chilled
hands
over
the
fire
stood
for
some
time
deep
in
thought

know
what
it
is
he
said
at
last
but
there
a
something
about
you
that
reminds
me
of
her

ai
your
voice
she
had
a
very
nice
voice
when

was
in
a
temper
and

smith
sharply

patched
in
a
dozen
places
and
your

feet
i
do
know
what
the
servant
must
think

davis
in
a
startled
voice

the
old
lady
that

a
bad

a
poor
devil

in
his
face

said
the
old
woman
in
a
changed
voice
davis
through
the
door
started
as
though
he
had
been
shot
and
facing
about
stood
eyeing
her
in
dumb
bewilderment
if

take
you
back
again
repeated
his
wife

going
to
behave
yourself
it
is
the
same
voice

same
face
said
the
old
woman

a
broomhandle
handy
davis
made
an
odd
noise
in
his
throat
if
you

been
so
down
on
your
luck
said
his
wife
blinking
her
eyes
rapidly

davis
stood
gaping
at
her
if

his
wife
speaking
very
slowly

going
to
behave
yourself

davis

voice
at
last
