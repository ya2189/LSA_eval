extensive

did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the
copyright
on
this
publication
was
renewed
when
marsy
gras
shot
off
its
skyrockets
mars
observatory
gave
it
the
works
fireworks
sunset
on
mars
is
a
pale
washed
out
watery
sort
of
procedure
that
is
hardly
worth
looking
at
the
shadows
of
the
cactus
lengthen
the
sun
goes
down
without
the
slightest
hint
of
color
or
display
and
everything
is
dark
about
once
a
year
there
is
one
cloud
that
turns
pink
briefly
but
even
the
travel
books
devote
more
space
describing
the
new
sign
adorning
the
canal
casino
than
they
do
on
the
sunset
the
night
sky
is
something
else
again
each
new
crop
of
tourists
goes
to
bed
at
sunrise
the
day
after
arrival
with
stiff
necks
from
looking
up
all
night
the
craters
of
the
moons
are
visible
to
the
naked
eye
and
even
a
cheap
pair
of
opera
glasses
can
pick
out
the
buildings
of
the
deimos
space
station
a
typical
comment
from
a
sightseer
is
just
think
fred
we
were
way
up
there
only
twelve
hours
ago
at
fairly
frequent
intervals
the
moons
eclipse
the
local
chamber
of
commerce
joins
with
the
gambling
casinos
to
use
these
occasions
as
excuses
for
a
celebration
the
marsy
gras
includes
floats
costumes
liquor
women
gambling
and
finishes
off
with
a
display
of
fireworks
and
a
stiff
note
of
protest
from
the
nearby
mars
observatory
the
day
after
a
particularly
noisy
glaring
fireworks
display
the
top
brass
at
the
observatory
called
an
emergency
meeting
the
topic
was
not
a
new
one
but
fresh
evidence
in
the
form
of
several
photographic
plates
showing
skyrocket
trails
and
a
galaxy
of
aerial
cracker
explosions
was
presented
i
maintain
they
fire
them
in
our
direction
on
purpose
one
scientist
declared
this
was
considered
to
be
correct
because
the
other
directions
around
town
were
oil
refineries
and
the
homes
of
the
casino
owners
why
do
we
just
move
the
observatory
way
out
in
the
desert
a
technician
demanded
it
would
be
much
of
a
job
it
would
be
a
tremendous
job
said
morton
the
physicist
if
not
for
the
glare
of
city
lights
on
earth
we
would
have
had
to
move
our
telescopes
to
the
moon
if
not
for
the
gravel
falling
out
of
the
sky
on
the
moon
making
it
necessary
to
resurface
the
reflectors
every
week
we
would
have
had
to
move
to
mars
viewing
conditions
here
are
just
about
perfect
except
for
the
immense
cost
of
transporting
the
equipment
building
materials
workmen
and
paying
us
triple
time
for
working
so
far
from
home
why
did
you
ever
figure
the
cost
of
a
single
photographic
plate
what
with
salaries
freight
to
and
from
earth
maintenance
and
all
the
rest
it
enormous
then
why
do
we
cut
down
the
cost
of
ruined
exposures
asked
the
technician
by
moving
the
observatory
away
from
town
because
morton
explained
we
have
to
bring
in
crews
to
tear
the
place
down
other
crews
to
move
it
still
more
crews
to
rebuild
it
not
to
mention
unavoidable
breakage
and
replacement
which
involve
more
freight
from
earth
at
per
pound
well
you
figure
it
out
so
we
ca
move
and
we
ca
afford
ruined
plates
said
the
scientist
who
had
considered
himself
a
target
for
the
fireworks
then
what
the
answer
the
usual
suggestion
was
proposed
that
a
delegation
approach
the
town
council
to
follow
up
the
letter
of
protest
a
search
through
the
past
meetings
minutes
showed
that
this
had
never
accomplished
anything
up
to
date
a
recent
arrival
to
the
observatory
mentioned
that
their
combined
brain
power
should
be
enough
to
beat
the
games
and
thus
force
the
casino
owners
who
were
the
real
offenders
out
of
business
one
of
the
scientists
who
had
already
tried
that
very
scheme
on
a
small
scale
reported
his
results
he
proved
with
his
tabulations
that
in
this
instance
science
in
the
guise
of
the
law
of
averages
was
unfortunately
against
them
morton
rose
to
his
feet
the
other
men
listened
to
his
plan
at
first
with
shocked
horror
then
with
deep
interest
and
finally
in
wild
exultation
the
meeting
broke
up
with
most
of
the
members
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
it
lucky
morton
is
a
physicist
said
one
of
the
directors
no
astronomer
would
ever
have
thought
of
that
a
few
days
later
a
modest
little
ad
appeared
in
the
weekly
publication
what
to
do
in
marsport
it
did
not
try
to
compete
with
any
of
the
casino
ads
all
of
which
featured
pretty
girls
but
it
had
a
unique
heading
free
for
the
first
time
ever
your
horoscope
scientifically
cast
by
the
staff
of
the
famous
mars
observatory
learn
your
luck
your
future
write
or
call
mars
observatory
no
charge
no
obligation
since
the
horoscopes
being
offered
were
about
the
only
things
on
mars
that
did
cost
the
tourists
any
money
the
response
was
great
the
recipient
of
a
horoscope
found
a
mimeographed
folder
which
contained
three
pages
describing
the
present
positions
of
the
planets
where
to
look
for
earth
in
the
sky
and
what
science
hoped
to
learn
the
next
time
mercury
was
in
transit
the
fourth
page
held
the
kicker
it
said
that
while
the
tourist
luck
would
be
better
than
average
at
most
of
the
gambling
houses
he
would
lose
consistently
if
he
played
at
harvey
club
within
two
days
the
only
people
playing
at
harvey
were
the
shills
the
following
day
the
visitors
to
the
observatory
included
harvey
the
gambler
was
welcomed
with
mingled
respect
for
his
money
and
contempt
for
his
occupation
he
was
taken
immediately
to
see
morton
who
greeted
him
with
a
sly
smile
harvey
conversation
was
brief
and
to
the
point
how
much
he
asked
waving
a
horoscope
under
morton
nose
just
a
promise
said
the
scientist
harvey
said
nothing
but
looked
sullen
you
are
on
the
town
council
morton
continued
now
the
next
time
the
question
of
tourist
entertainment
is
discussed
we
want
you
to
vote
a
fireworks
display
he
then
explained
how
important
plates
had
been
ruined
by
skyrocket
trails
harvey
listened
with
great
interest
especially
when
morton
flatly
stated
that
each
casino
in
turn
would
get
the
same
publicity
in
the
horoscopes
the
council
members
are
all
for
the
tourists
harvey
commented
and
you
guys
are
supposed
to
be
nuts
like
all
scientists
but
i
do
like
you
say
he
reached
into
his
pocket
here
fifty
bucks
use
it
for
a
full
page
ad
this
time
and
do
the
desert
sands
casino
in
your
next
horoscope
and
say
before
i
go
can
i
look
through
the
telescope
i
never
seemed
to
have
the
time
before
at
weekly
intervals
morton
did
the
desert
sands
paradise
the
martian
gardens
and
the
two
moons
club
from
each
owner
he
extracted
the
same
promise
to
vote
against
the
fireworks
at
the
council
meetings
the
technique
was
settling
down
to
a
routine
each
victim
came
made
the
promise
paid
for
the
following
week
ad
named
the
next
casino
and
was
taken
on
a
tour
of
the
observatory
then
disaster
struck
it
took
the
form
of
an
interplanetary
telegram
from
harvard
observatory
their
parent
organization
it
read
earth
newspapers
carrying
accounts
of
horoscopes
published
by
your
organization
very
unscientific
must
stop
at
once
find
other
solution
l
k
bell
director
morton
was
eating
alone
in
the
staff
dining
room
when
he
noticed
a
familiar
face
beside
him
harvey
he
said
guess
you
come
down
to
gloat
over
our
misfortune
no
professor
said
harvey
you
got
my
promise
to
help
you
boys
and
i
stick
by
you
it
a
rotten
shame
too
you
just
about
made
it
the
rest
of
the
club
owners
saw
the
writing
on
the
wall
and
were
going
to
cooperate
with
you
when
the
telegram
came
all
of
us
got
contacts
in
the
telegraph
office
so
they
heard
about
it
soon
as
it
arrived
and
stayed
away
morton
said
yes
i
supposed
they
would
there
not
much
we
can
do
now
there
are
thirteen
members
on
the
council
harvey
continued
and
you
got
five
of
us
if
that
telegram
had
only
come
one
day
later
no
more
fireworks
but
i
got
an
idea
morton
pushed
aside
his
empty
coffee
cup
and
stood
up
let
get
out
in
the
fresh
air
the
town
council
was
adding
insult
to
injury
by
staging
one
of
the
biggest
fireworks
displays
ever
it
consisted
of
practically
all
skyrockets
morton
expressed
wonder
at
their
supply
harvey
explained
that
they
were
made
right
on
mars
he
went
on
to
tell
his
idea
i
was
real
interested
in
everything
when
you
took
me
around
the
first
time
i
was
here
the
gambler
said
the
same
goes
for
the
other
boys
who
saw
the
place
most
of
us
meant
to
come
out
here
and
look
around
sometime
but
you
people
work
nights
and
us
mostly
working
nights
too
we
never
got
around
to
it
how
about
arranging
an
exclusive
tour
sometime
just
for
the
club
operators
and
their
help
then
when
they
see
everything
you
could
offer
to
name
a
star
after
them
or
something
if
i
had
already
promised
i
be
willing
to
promise
just
to
be
able
to
point
in
the
sky
and
say
harvey
star
morton
smiled
gently
that
a
wonderful
idea
he
said
but
i
do
think
it
would
work
any
stars
worth
looking
at
with
the
naked
eye
already
have
names
the
only
ones
we
could
name
after
people
are
so
far
away
that
it
would
take
an
exposure
of
several
hours
just
to
see
them
on
a
photographic
plate
you
would
be
able
to
point
yours
out
at
all
besides
harvard
observatory
would
stand
for
this
idea
either
it
would
make
as
much
sense
to
them
as
you
naming
a
poker
chip
after
me
he
sighed
but
in
any
case
we
would
like
to
have
all
the
owners
over
some
time
it
might
improve
relations
somewhat
the
two
of
them
watched
a
rocket
wobble
all
over
the
sky
before
exploding
let
go
back
inside
said
the
physicist
maybe
we
can
arrange
that
tour
for
sunday
sunday
afternoon
the
visitors
presumably
softened
up
by
what
one
of
the
chemists
thought
were
martinis
were
seated
in
the
lecture
hall
listening
to
morton
concluding
remarks
one
of
the
technicians
is
working
on
a
gadget
with
a
photocell
that
closes
the
shutter
on
the
film
when
a
rocket
goes
up
morton
was
saying
it
should
cut
down
the
exposure
time
a
great
deal
right
now
every
night
may
be
significant
if
the
plates
from
any
one
night
are
spoiled
we
may
not
be
able
to
duplicate
them
for
a
martian
year
mankind
is
preparing
the
first
trip
to
another
star
and
the
work
of
mars
observatory
is
necessary
to
insure
the
success
of
that
trip
you
gentlemen
are
rightly
the
leaders
of
mars
and
so
it
is
up
to
you
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
success
will
be
possible
he
sat
down
to
a
smattering
of
applause
the
visitors
except
harvey
then
left
it
did
go
over
professor
said
harvey
i
know
said
morton
that
washes
out
that
plan
he
turned
to
the
gambler
you
the
only
person
i
can
trust
with
this
he
said
how
would
you
like
to
help
me
make
some
fireworks
one
week
later
the
two
men
had
everything
ready
that
night
as
quietly
as
possible
they
moved
to
a
position
behind
a
fence
near
the
skyrocket
launching
racks
morton
was
carrying
a
compass
a
flashlight
and
a
small
clinometer
harvey
was
struggling
with
two
large
skyrockets
he
whispered
what
if
we
miss
or
they
go
off
too
soon
or
something
nonsense
harvey
said
morton
he
busied
himself
with
the
flashlight
and
compass
and
carefully
aimed
one
of
the
rockets
you
forget
i
am
a
physicist
he
then
aimed
the
other
rocket
and
checked
elevation
with
the
clinometer
the
fuels
are
standard
and
i
worked
out
the
trajectories
on
the
computer
ready
with
your
match
these
are
going
to
explode
in
the
canal
and
get
everybody
in
the
canal
casino
all
wet
he
peeked
over
the
fence
to
see
how
the
regular
display
was
doing
here
comes
their
finale
ready
set
light
covered
by
the
launching
of
the
last
of
the
official
display
their
two
rockets
arced
up
and
away
one
of
them
did
explode
in
the
canal
and
most
of
the
casino
patrons
did
get
wet
but
the
other
wobbled
off
to
the
right
landed
on
the
roof
of
harvey
bachelor
home
and
burned
it
to
the
ground
morton
sat
numbly
in
front
of
his
typewriter
staring
at
a
letter
he
could
seem
to
find
the
right
words
for
what
he
wished
to
say
he
tried
to
derive
inspiration
from
a
glossy
photograph
lying
on
the
table
beside
him
it
had
what
looked
like
another
skyrocket
trail
on
it
before
he
could
answer
it
the
door
opened
and
harvey
walked
in
accompanied
by
two
men
with
muscles
i
have
seen
you
since
the
accident
professor
he
said
i
been
trying
to
write
you
a
letter
said
morton
to
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
about
what
happened
and
i
also
have
to
thank
you
for
getting
that
law
against
fireworks
through
the
council
i
am
extremely
sorry
it
took
your
house
burning
down
to
convince
them
i
keep
my
promises
said
harvey
one
of
the
men
with
muscles
turned
the
radio
on
loud
we
trying
to
get
up
a
collection
among
the
staff
to
help
pay
for
your
losses
said
morton
but
the
director
suggested
a
more
permanent
kind
of
remembrance
he
picked
up
the
photograph
this
will
be
one
of
the
brightest
objects
in
the
sky
in
a
few
months
it
be
back
again
for
thousands
of
years
but
it
will
be
around
for
a
good
while
we
just
discovered
it
and
it
is
our
privilege
to
call
it
comet
that
nice
said
harvey
the
first
of
the
two
men
went
around
pulling
down
blinds
the
other
went
into
the
bathroom
and
starting
filling
the
tub
well
said
the
physicist
looking
tired
and
old
i
guess
nothing
more
i
can
say
oh
yes
there
is
professor
said
harvey
with
a
sudden
grin
on
his
face
he
turned
to
his
muscle
men
you
two
guys
cut
out
the
comedy
and
bring
it
in
now
the
two
men
followed
his
instructions
you
see
professor
the
gambler
continued
i
took
a
beating
on
the
house
but
the
other
club
boys
chipped
in
and
made
up
all
my
losses
so
i
do
need
your
money
at
all
besides
i
have
two
things
to
thank
for
first
i
heard
about
the
comet
from
one
of
your
men
and
it
the
nicest
thing
anybody
ever
done
for
me
one
of
his
men
came
back
with
what
looked
like
a
round
candy
box
second
that
fire
was
the
best
publicity
stunt
i
could
get
it
made
the
papers
back
on
earth
and
all
the
new
tourists
are
packing
into
the
harvey
club
even
the
other
operators
are
playing
my
tables
that
why
i
want
you
to
have
this
he
handed
morton
the
box
it
read
harvey
club
in
the
center
and
doctor
morton
poker
chip
around
the
edge
across
the
bottom
it
said
five
thousand
that
dollars
in
it
professor
said
harvey
do
spend
it
all
in
one
place
