me
live
out
my
years
in
heat
of
blood
let
me
lie
drunken
with
the
wine
let
me
not
see
this
built
of
mud
go
toppling
to
the
dust
a
vacant
shrine
chapter
i
the
one
opened
the
door
with
a
and
went
in
followed
by
a
young
fellow
who
awkwardly
removed
his
cap
he
wore
rough
clothes
that
smacked
of
the
sea
and
he
was
manifestly
out
of
place
in
the
spacious
hall
in
which
he
found
himself
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
his
cap
and
was
stuffing
it
into
his
coat
pocket
when
the
other
took
it
from
him
the
act
was
done
quietly
and
naturally
and
the
awkward
young
fellow
appreciated
it
understands
was
his
thought
see
me
through
all
he
walked
at
the
heels
with
a
swing
to
his
shoulders
and
his
legs
spread
unwittingly
as
if
the
level
floors
were
tilting
up
and
sinking
down
to
the
heave
and
lunge
of
the
sea
the
wide
rooms
seemed
too
narrow
for
his
rolling
gait
and
to
himself
he
was
in
terror
lest
his
broad
shoulders
should
collide
with
the
doorways
or
sweep
the
from
the
low
mantel
he
recoiled
from
side
to
side
between
the
various
objects
and
multiplied
the
hazards
that
in
reality
lodged
only
in
his
mind
between
a
grand
piano
and
a
piled
high
with
books
was
space
for
a
half
a
dozen
to
walk
abreast
yet
he
essayed
it
with
trepidation
his
heavy
arms
hung
loosely
at
his
sides
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
those
arms
and
hands
and
when
to
his
excited
vision
one
arm
seemed
liable
to
brush
against
the
books
on
the
table
he
lurched
away
like
a
frightened
horse
barely
missing
the
piano
stool
he
watched
the
easy
walk
of
the
other
in
front
of
him
and
for
the
first
time
realized
that
his
walk
was
different
from
that
of
other
men
he
experienced
a
momentary
pang
of
shame
that
he
should
walk
so
uncouthly
the
sweat
burst
through
the
skin
of
his
forehead
in
tiny
beads
and
he
paused
and
mopped
his
bronzed
face
with
his
handkerchief
on
arthur
my
boy
he
said
attempting
to
mask
his
anxiety
with
facetious
utterance
is
too
much
all
at
once
for
yours
truly
give
me
a
chance
to
get
my
nerve
you
know
i
want
to
come
i
guess
your
to
see
me
all
right
was
the
reassuring
answer
be
frightened
at
us
just
homely
a
letter
for
he
stepped
back
to
the
table
tore
open
the
envelope
and
began
to
read
giving
the
stranger
an
opportunity
to
recover
himself
and
the
stranger
understood
and
appreciated
his
was
the
gift
of
sympathy
understanding
and
beneath
his
alarmed
exterior
that
sympathetic
process
went
on
he
mopped
his
forehead
dry
and
glanced
about
him
with
a
controlled
face
though
in
the
eyes
there
was
an
expression
such
as
wild
animals
betray
when
they
fear
the
trap
he
was
surrounded
by
the
unknown
apprehensive
of
what
might
happen
ignorant
of
what
he
should
do
aware
that
he
walked
and
bore
himself
awkwardly
fearful
that
every
attribute
and
power
of
him
was
similarly
afflicted
he
was
keenly
sensitive
hopelessly
and
the
amused
glance
that
the
other
stole
privily
at
him
over
the
top
of
the
letter
burned
into
him
like
a
he
saw
the
glance
but
he
gave
no
sign
for
among
the
things
he
had
learned
was
discipline
also
that
went
to
his
pride
he
cursed
himself
for
having
come
and
at
the
same
time
resolved
that
happen
what
would
having
come
he
would
carry
it
through
the
lines
of
his
face
hardened
and
into
his
eyes
came
a
fighting
light
he
looked
about
more
unconcernedly
sharply
observant
every
detail
of
the
pretty
interior
registering
itself
on
his
brain
his
eyes
were
wide
apart
nothing
in
their
field
of
vision
escaped
and
as
they
drank
in
the
beauty
before
them
the
fighting
light
died
out
and
a
warm
glow
took
its
place
he
was
responsive
to
beauty
and
here
was
cause
to
respond
an
oil
painting
caught
and
held
him
a
heavy
surf
thundered
and
burst
over
an
outjutting
rock
lowering
covered
the
sky
and
outside
the
line
of
surf
a
heeled
over
till
every
detail
of
her
deck
was
visible
was
surging
along
against
a
stormy
sunset
sky
there
was
beauty
and
it
drew
him
irresistibly
he
forgot
his
awkward
walk
and
came
closer
to
the
painting
very
close
the
beauty
faded
out
of
the
canvas
his
face
expressed
his
bepuzzlement
he
stared
at
what
seemed
a
careless
daub
of
paint
then
stepped
away
immediately
all
the
beauty
flashed
back
into
the
canvas
trick
picture
was
his
thought
as
he
dismissed
it
though
in
the
midst
of
the
multitudinous
impressions
he
was
receiving
he
found
time
to
feel
a
prod
of
indignation
that
so
much
beauty
should
be
sacrificed
to
make
a
trick
he
did
not
know
painting
he
had
been
brought
up
on
chromos
and
lithographs
that
were
always
definite
and
sharp
near
or
far
he
had
seen
oil
paintings
it
was
true
in
the
show
windows
of
shops
but
the
glass
of
the
windows
had
prevented
his
eager
eyes
from
approaching
too
near
he
glanced
around
at
his
friend
reading
the
letter
and
saw
the
books
on
the
table
into
his
eyes
leaped
a
wistfulness
and
a
yearning
as
promptly
as
the
yearning
leaps
into
the
eyes
of
a
starving
man
at
sight
of
food
an
impulsive
stride
with
one
lurch
to
right
and
left
of
the
shoulders
brought
him
to
the
table
where
he
began
affectionately
handling
the
books
he
glanced
at
the
titles
and
the
names
read
fragments
of
text
caressing
the
volumes
with
his
eyes
and
hands
and
once
recognized
a
book
he
had
read
for
the
rest
they
were
strange
books
and
strange
authors
he
chanced
upon
a
volume
of
swinburne
and
began
reading
steadily
forgetful
of
where
he
was
his
face
glowing
twice
he
closed
the
book
on
his
forefinger
to
look
at
the
name
of
the
author
swinburne
he
would
remember
that
name
that
fellow
had
eyes
and
he
had
certainly
seen
color
and
flashing
light
but
who
was
swinburne
was
he
dead
a
hundred
years
or
so
like
most
of
the
poets
or
was
he
alive
still
and
writing
he
turned
to
the
yes
he
had
written
other
books
well
he
would
go
to
the
free
library
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
try
to
get
hold
of
some
of
stuff
he
went
back
to
the
text
and
lost
himself
he
did
not
notice
that
a
young
woman
had
entered
the
room
the
first
he
knew
was
when
he
heard
voice
saying
this
is
the
book
was
closed
on
his
forefinger
and
before
he
turned
he
was
thrilling
to
the
first
new
impression
which
was
not
of
the
girl
but
of
her
words
under
that
muscled
body
of
his
he
was
a
mass
of
quivering
sensibilities
at
the
slightest
impact
of
the
outside
world
upon
his
consciousness
his
thoughts
sympathies
and
emotions
leapt
and
played
like
lambent
flame
he
was
extraordinarily
receptive
and
responsive
while
his
imagination
pitched
high
was
ever
at
work
establishing
relations
of
likeness
and
difference
eden
was
what
he
had
thrilled
who
had
been
called
or
eden
or
just
all
his
life
and
it
was
certainly
going
some
was
his
internal
comment
his
mind
seemed
to
turn
on
the
instant
into
a
vast
camera
obscura
and
he
saw
arrayed
around
his
consciousness
endless
pictures
from
his
life
of
and
forecastles
camps
and
beaches
jails
and
and
slum
streets
wherein
the
thread
of
association
was
the
fashion
in
which
he
had
been
addressed
in
those
various
situations
and
then
he
turned
and
saw
the
girl
the
phantasmagoria
of
his
brain
vanished
at
sight
of
her
she
was
a
pale
ethereal
creature
with
wide
spiritual
blue
eyes
and
a
wealth
of
golden
hair
he
did
not
know
how
she
was
dressed
except
that
the
dress
was
as
wonderful
as
she
he
likened
her
to
a
pale
gold
flower
upon
a
slender
stem
no
she
was
a
spirit
a
divinity
a
goddess
such
sublimated
beauty
was
not
of
the
earth
or
perhaps
the
books
were
right
and
there
were
many
such
as
she
in
the
upper
walks
of
life
she
might
well
be
sung
by
that
chap
swinburne
perhaps
he
had
had
somebody
like
her
in
mind
when
he
painted
that
girl
iseult
in
the
book
there
on
the
table
all
this
plethora
of
sight
and
feeling
and
thought
occurred
on
the
instant
there
was
no
pause
of
the
realities
wherein
he
moved
he
saw
her
hand
coming
out
to
his
and
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
as
she
shook
hands
frankly
like
a
man
the
women
he
had
known
did
not
shake
hands
that
way
for
that
matter
most
of
them
did
not
shake
hands
at
all
a
flood
of
associations
visions
of
various
ways
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
women
rushed
into
his
mind
and
threatened
to
swamp
it
but
he
shook
them
aside
and
looked
at
her
never
had
he
seen
such
a
woman
the
women
he
had
known
immediately
beside
her
on
either
hand
ranged
the
women
he
had
known
for
an
eternal
second
he
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
portrait
gallery
wherein
she
occupied
the
central
place
while
about
her
were
limned
many
women
all
to
be
weighed
and
measured
by
a
fleeting
glance
herself
the
unit
of
weight
and
measure
he
saw
the
weak
and
sickly
faces
of
the
girls
of
the
factories
and
the
simpering
boisterous
girls
from
the
south
of
market
there
were
women
of
the
cattle
camps
and
swarthy
women
of
old
mexico
these
in
turn
were
crowded
out
by
japanese
women
stepping
mincingly
on
wooden
clogs
by
eurasians
delicate
featured
stamped
with
degeneracy
by
women
and
all
these
were
blotted
out
by
a
grotesque
and
terrible
nightmare
shuffling
creatures
from
the
pavements
of
whitechapel
hags
of
the
stews
and
all
the
vast
following
of
harpies
and
filthy
that
under
the
guise
of
monstrous
female
form
prey
upon
sailors
the
scrapings
of
the
ports
the
scum
and
slime
of
the
human
pit
you
sit
down
eden
the
girl
was
saying
have
been
looking
forward
to
meeting
you
ever
since
arthur
told
us
it
was
brave
of
he
waved
his
hand
deprecatingly
and
muttered
that
it
was
nothing
at
all
what
he
had
done
and
that
any
fellow
would
have
done
it
she
noticed
that
the
hand
he
waved
was
covered
with
fresh
abrasions
in
the
process
of
healing
and
a
glance
at
the
other
hand
showed
it
to
be
in
the
same
condition
also
with
quick
critical
eye
she
noted
a
scar
on
his
cheek
another
that
peeped
out
from
under
the
hair
of
the
forehead
and
a
third
that
ran
down
and
disappeared
under
the
starched
collar
she
repressed
a
smile
at
sight
of
the
red
line
that
marked
the
chafe
of
the
collar
against
the
bronzed
neck
he
was
evidently
unused
to
stiff
collars
likewise
her
feminine
eye
took
in
the
clothes
he
wore
the
cheap
and
unaesthetic
cut
the
wrinkling
of
the
coat
across
the
shoulders
and
the
series
of
wrinkles
in
the
sleeves
that
advertised
bulging
biceps
muscles
while
he
waved
his
hand
and
muttered
that
he
had
done
nothing
at
all
he
was
obeying
her
behest
by
trying
to
get
into
a
chair
he
found
time
to
admire
the
ease
with
which
she
sat
down
then
lurched
toward
a
chair
facing
her
overwhelmed
with
consciousness
of
the
awkward
figure
he
was
cutting
this
was
a
new
experience
for
him
all
his
life
up
to
then
he
had
been
unaware
of
being
either
graceful
or
awkward
such
thoughts
of
self
had
never
entered
his
mind
he
sat
down
gingerly
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
greatly
worried
by
his
hands
they
were
in
the
way
wherever
he
put
them
arthur
was
leaving
the
room
and
martin
eden
followed
his
exit
with
longing
eyes
he
felt
lost
alone
there
in
the
room
with
that
pale
spirit
of
a
woman
there
was
no
upon
whom
to
call
for
drinks
no
small
boy
to
send
around
the
corner
for
a
can
of
beer
and
by
means
of
that
social
fluid
start
the
amenities
of
friendship
flowing
have
such
a
scar
on
your
neck
eden
the
girl
was
saying
did
it
happen
i
am
sure
it
must
have
been
some
mexican
with
a
knife
miss
he
answered
moistening
his
parched
lips
and
clearing
his
throat
was
just
a
fight
after
i
got
the
knife
away
he
tried
to
bite
off
my
baldly
as
he
had
stated
it
in
his
eyes
was
a
rich
vision
of
that
hot
starry
night
at
salina
cruz
the
white
strip
of
beach
the
lights
of
the
sugar
steamers
in
the
harbor
the
voices
of
the
drunken
sailors
in
the
distance
the
jostling
stevedores
the
flaming
passion
in
the
face
the
glint
of
the
in
the
starlight
the
sting
of
the
steel
in
his
neck
and
the
rush
of
blood
the
crowd
and
the
cries
the
two
bodies
his
and
the
locked
together
rolling
over
and
over
and
tearing
up
the
sand
and
from
away
off
somewhere
the
mellow
tinkling
of
a
guitar
such
was
the
picture
and
he
thrilled
to
the
memory
of
it
wondering
if
the
man
could
paint
it
who
had
painted
the
on
the
wall
the
white
beach
the
stars
and
the
lights
of
the
sugar
steamers
would
look
great
he
thought
and
midway
on
the
sand
the
dark
group
of
figures
that
surrounded
the
fighters
the
knife
occupied
a
place
in
the
picture
he
decided
and
would
show
well
with
a
sort
of
gleam
in
the
light
of
the
stars
but
of
all
this
no
hint
had
crept
into
his
speech
tried
to
bite
off
my
nose
he
concluded
the
girl
said
in
a
faint
far
voice
and
he
noticed
the
shock
in
her
sensitive
face
he
felt
a
shock
himself
and
a
blush
of
embarrassment
shone
faintly
on
his
sunburned
cheeks
though
to
him
it
burned
as
hotly
as
when
his
cheeks
had
been
exposed
to
the
open
in
the
such
sordid
things
as
stabbing
affrays
were
evidently
not
fit
subjects
for
conversation
with
a
lady
people
in
the
books
in
her
walk
of
life
did
not
talk
about
such
they
did
not
know
about
them
either
there
was
a
brief
pause
in
the
conversation
they
were
trying
to
get
started
then
she
asked
tentatively
about
the
scar
on
his
cheek
even
as
she
asked
he
realized
that
she
was
making
an
effort
to
talk
his
talk
and
he
resolved
to
get
away
from
it
and
talk
hers
was
just
an
accident
he
said
putting
his
hand
to
his
cheek
night
in
a
calm
with
a
heavy
sea
running
the
carried
away
next
the
tackle
the
lift
was
wire
it
was
around
like
a
snake
the
whole
watch
was
to
grab
it
i
rushed
in
got
she
said
this
time
with
an
accent
of
comprehension
though
secretly
his
speech
had
been
so
much
greek
to
her
and
she
was
wondering
what
a
was
and
what
meant
man
swineburne
he
began
attempting
to
put
his
plan
into
execution
and
pronouncing
the
long
he
repeated
with
the
same
mispronunciation
she
corrected
the
chap
he
stammered
his
cheeks
hot
again
long
since
he
died
i
heard
that
he
was
she
looked
at
him
curiously
did
you
make
his
acquaintance
never
clapped
eyes
on
him
was
the
reply
i
read
some
of
his
poetry
out
of
that
book
there
on
the
table
just
before
you
come
in
how
do
you
like
his
poetry
and
thereat
she
began
to
talk
quickly
and
easily
upon
the
subject
he
had
suggested
he
felt
better
and
settled
back
slightly
from
the
edge
of
the
chair
holding
tightly
to
its
arms
with
his
hands
as
if
it
might
get
away
from
him
and
buck
him
to
the
floor
he
had
succeeded
in
making
her
talk
her
talk
and
while
she
rattled
on
he
strove
to
follow
her
marvelling
at
all
the
knowledge
that
was
stowed
away
in
that
pretty
head
of
hers
and
drinking
in
the
pale
beauty
of
her
face
follow
her
he
did
though
bothered
by
unfamiliar
words
that
fell
glibly
from
her
lips
and
by
critical
phrases
and
that
were
foreign
to
his
mind
but
that
nevertheless
stimulated
his
mind
and
set
it
tingling
here
was
intellectual
life
he
thought
and
here
was
beauty
warm
and
wonderful
as
he
had
never
dreamed
it
could
be
he
forgot
himself
and
stared
at
her
with
hungry
eyes
here
was
something
to
live
for
to
win
to
to
fight
and
die
for
the
books
were
true
there
were
such
women
in
the
world
she
was
one
of
them
she
lent
wings
to
his
imagination
and
great
luminous
canvases
spread
themselves
before
him
whereon
loomed
vague
gigantic
figures
of
love
and
romance
and
of
heroic
deeds
for
a
pale
woman
a
flower
of
gold
and
through
the
swaying
palpitant
vision
as
through
a
fairy
mirage
he
stared
at
the
real
woman
sitting
there
and
talking
of
literature
and
art
he
listened
as
well
but
he
stared
unconscious
of
the
fixity
of
his
gaze
or
of
the
fact
that
all
that
was
essentially
masculine
in
his
nature
was
shining
in
his
eyes
but
she
who
knew
little
of
the
world
of
men
being
a
woman
was
keenly
aware
of
his
burning
eyes
she
had
never
had
men
look
at
her
in
such
fashion
and
it
embarrassed
her
she
stumbled
and
halted
in
her
utterance
the
thread
of
argument
slipped
from
her
he
frightened
her
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
strangely
pleasant
to
be
so
looked
upon
her
training
warned
her
of
peril
and
of
wrong
subtle
mysterious
luring
while
her
instincts
rang
through
her
being
impelling
her
to
hurdle
caste
and
place
and
gain
to
this
traveller
from
another
world
to
this
uncouth
young
fellow
with
lacerated
hands
and
a
line
of
raw
red
caused
by
the
unaccustomed
linen
at
his
throat
who
all
too
evidently
was
soiled
and
tainted
by
ungracious
existence
she
was
clean
and
her
cleanness
revolted
but
she
was
woman
and
she
was
just
beginning
to
learn
the
paradox
of
woman
i
was
was
i
saying
she
broke
off
abruptly
and
laughed
merrily
at
her
predicament
was
saying
that
this
man
swinburne
failed
a
great
poet
that
was
as
far
as
you
got
miss
he
prompted
while
to
himself
he
seemed
suddenly
hungry
and
delicious
little
thrills
crawled
up
and
down
his
spine
at
the
sound
of
her
laughter
like
silver
he
thought
to
himself
like
tinkling
silver
bells
and
on
the
instant
and
for
an
instant
he
was
transported
to
a
far
land
where
under
pink
cherry
blossoms
he
smoked
a
cigarette
and
listened
to
the
bells
of
the
peaked
pagoda
calling
devotees
to
worship
thank
you
she
said
fails
when
all
is
said
because
he
is
well
indelicate
there
are
many
of
his
poems
that
should
never
be
read
every
line
of
the
really
great
poets
is
filled
with
beautiful
truth
and
calls
to
all
that
is
high
and
noble
in
the
human
not
a
line
of
the
great
poets
can
be
spared
without
impoverishing
the
world
by
that
thought
it
was
great
he
said
hesitatingly
little
i
read
i
had
no
idea
he
was
such
scoundrel
i
guess
that
crops
out
in
his
other
are
many
lines
that
could
be
spared
from
the
book
you
were
reading
she
said
her
voice
primly
firm
and
dogmatic
must
missed
he
announced
i
read
was
the
real
goods
it
was
all
lighted
up
shining
it
shun
right
into
me
lighted
me
up
inside
like
the
sun
or
a
searchlight
the
way
it
landed
on
me
but
i
guess
i
up
much
on
poetry
he
broke
off
lamely
he
was
confused
painfully
conscious
of
his
inarticulateness
he
had
felt
the
bigness
and
glow
of
life
in
what
he
had
read
but
his
speech
was
inadequate
he
could
not
express
what
he
felt
and
to
himself
he
likened
himself
to
a
sailor
in
a
strange
ship
on
a
dark
night
groping
about
in
the
unfamiliar
running
rigging
well
he
decided
it
was
up
to
him
to
get
acquainted
in
this
new
world
he
had
never
seen
anything
that
he
get
the
hang
of
when
he
wanted
to
and
it
was
about
time
for
him
to
want
to
learn
to
talk
the
things
that
were
inside
of
him
so
that
she
could
understand
was
bulking
large
on
his
horizon
she
was
saying
read
he
broke
in
impulsively
spurred
on
to
exhibit
and
make
the
most
of
his
little
store
of
book
knowledge
desirous
of
showing
her
that
he
was
not
wholly
a
stupid
clod
psalm
of
life
i
guess
she
nodded
her
head
and
smiled
and
he
felt
somehow
that
her
smile
was
tolerant
pitifully
tolerant
he
was
a
fool
to
attempt
to
make
a
pretence
that
way
that
longfellow
chap
most
likely
had
written
countless
books
of
poetry
me
miss
for
in
that
way
i
guess
the
real
facts
is
that
i
know
much
about
such
things
it
in
my
class
but
to
make
it
in
my
it
sounded
like
a
threat
his
voice
was
determined
his
eyes
were
flashing
the
lines
of
his
face
had
grown
harsh
and
to
her
it
seemed
that
the
angle
of
his
jaw
had
changed
its
pitch
had
become
unpleasantly
aggressive
at
the
same
time
a
wave
of
intense
virility
seemed
to
surge
out
from
him
and
impinge
upon
her
think
you
could
make
it
your
class
she
finished
with
a
laugh
are
very
her
gaze
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
muscular
neck
heavy
corded
almost
bronzed
by
the
sun
spilling
over
with
rugged
health
and
strength
and
though
he
sat
there
blushing
and
humble
again
she
felt
drawn
to
him
she
was
surprised
by
a
wanton
thought
that
rushed
into
her
mind
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
could
lay
her
two
hands
upon
that
neck
that
all
its
strength
and
vigor
would
flow
out
to
her
she
was
shocked
by
this
thought
it
seemed
to
reveal
to
her
an
undreamed
depravity
in
her
nature
besides
strength
to
her
was
a
gross
and
brutish
thing
her
ideal
of
masculine
beauty
had
always
been
slender
gracefulness
yet
the
thought
still
persisted
it
bewildered
her
that
she
should
desire
to
place
her
hands
on
that
sunburned
neck
in
truth
she
was
far
from
robust
and
the
need
of
her
body
and
mind
was
for
strength
but
she
did
not
know
it
she
knew
only
that
no
man
had
ever
affected
her
before
as
this
one
had
who
shocked
her
from
moment
to
moment
with
his
awful
grammar
i
no
invalid
he
said
it
comes
down
to
i
can
digest
but
just
now
got
dyspepsia
most
of
what
you
was
i
digest
never
trained
that
way
you
see
i
like
books
and
poetry
and
what
time
had
read
but
never
thought
about
the
way
you
have
why
i
talk
about
like
a
navigator
adrift
on
a
strange
sea
without
chart
or
compass
now
i
want
to
get
my
mebbe
you
can
put
me
right
how
did
you
learn
all
this
ben
going
to
school
i
fancy
and
by
studying
she
answered
went
to
school
when
i
was
a
kid
he
began
to
object
but
i
mean
high
school
and
lectures
and
the
gone
to
the
university
he
demanded
in
frank
amazement
he
felt
that
she
had
become
remoter
from
him
by
at
least
a
million
miles
going
there
now
taking
special
courses
in
he
did
not
know
what
meant
but
he
made
a
mental
note
of
that
item
of
ignorance
and
passed
on
long
would
i
have
to
study
before
i
could
go
to
the
university
he
asked
she
beamed
encouragement
upon
his
desire
for
knowledge
and
said
depends
upon
how
much
studying
you
have
already
done
you
have
never
attended
high
school
of
course
not
but
did
you
finish
grammar
school
had
two
years
to
run
when
i
left
he
answered
i
was
always
honorably
promoted
at
the
next
moment
angry
with
himself
for
the
boast
he
had
gripped
the
arms
of
the
chair
so
savagely
that
every
was
stinging
at
the
same
moment
he
became
aware
that
a
woman
was
entering
the
room
he
saw
the
girl
leave
her
chair
and
trip
swiftly
across
the
floor
to
the
newcomer
they
kissed
each
other
and
with
arms
around
each
waists
they
advanced
toward
him
that
must
be
her
mother
he
thought
she
was
a
tall
blond
woman
slender
and
stately
and
beautiful
her
gown
was
what
he
might
expect
in
such
a
house
his
eyes
delighted
in
the
graceful
lines
of
it
she
and
her
dress
together
reminded
him
of
women
on
the
stage
then
he
remembered
seeing
similar
grand
ladies
and
gowns
entering
the
london
theatres
while
he
stood
and
watched
and
the
policemen
shoved
him
back
into
the
drizzle
beyond
the
awning
next
his
mind
leaped
to
the
grand
hotel
at
yokohama
where
too
from
the
sidewalk
he
had
seen
grand
ladies
then
the
city
and
the
harbor
of
yokohama
in
a
thousand
pictures
began
flashing
before
his
eyes
but
he
swiftly
dismissed
the
kaleidoscope
of
memory
oppressed
by
the
urgent
need
of
the
present
he
knew
that
he
must
stand
up
to
be
introduced
and
he
struggled
painfully
to
his
feet
where
he
stood
with
trousers
bagging
at
the
knees
his
arms
and
ludicrous
his
face
set
hard
for
the
impending
ordeal
chapter
ii
the
process
of
getting
into
the
dining
room
was
a
nightmare
to
him
between
halts
and
stumbles
jerks
and
lurches
locomotion
had
at
times
seemed
impossible
but
at
last
he
had
made
it
and
was
seated
alongside
of
her
the
array
of
knives
and
forks
frightened
him
they
bristled
with
unknown
perils
and
he
gazed
at
them
fascinated
till
their
dazzle
became
a
background
across
which
moved
a
succession
of
forecastle
pictures
wherein
he
and
his
mates
sat
eating
salt
beef
with
and
fingers
or
scooping
thick
out
of
pannikins
by
means
of
battered
iron
spoons
the
stench
of
bad
beef
was
in
his
nostrils
while
in
his
ears
to
the
accompaniment
of
creaking
timbers
and
groaning
bulkheads
echoed
the
loud
of
the
eaters
he
watched
them
eating
and
decided
that
they
ate
like
pigs
well
he
would
be
careful
here
he
would
make
no
noise
he
would
keep
his
mind
upon
it
all
the
time
he
glanced
around
the
table
opposite
him
was
arthur
and
brother
norman
they
were
her
brothers
he
reminded
himself
and
his
heart
warmed
toward
them
how
they
loved
each
other
the
members
of
this
family
there
flashed
into
his
mind
the
picture
of
her
mother
of
the
kiss
of
greeting
and
of
the
pair
of
them
walking
toward
him
with
arms
entwined
not
in
his
world
were
such
displays
of
affection
between
parents
and
children
made
it
was
a
revelation
of
the
heights
of
existence
that
were
attained
in
the
world
above
it
was
the
finest
thing
yet
that
he
had
seen
in
this
small
glimpse
of
that
world
he
was
moved
deeply
by
appreciation
of
it
and
his
heart
was
melting
with
sympathetic
tenderness
he
had
starved
for
love
all
his
life
his
nature
craved
love
it
was
an
organic
demand
of
his
being
yet
he
had
gone
without
and
hardened
himself
in
the
process
he
had
not
known
that
he
needed
love
nor
did
he
know
it
now
he
merely
saw
it
in
operation
and
thrilled
to
it
and
thought
it
fine
and
high
and
splendid
he
was
glad
that
morse
was
not
there
it
was
difficult
enough
getting
acquainted
with
her
and
her
mother
and
her
brother
norman
arthur
he
already
knew
somewhat
the
father
would
have
been
too
much
for
him
he
felt
sure
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
worked
so
hard
in
his
life
the
severest
toil
was
play
compared
with
this
tiny
nodules
of
moisture
stood
out
on
his
forehead
and
his
shirt
was
wet
with
sweat
from
the
exertion
of
doing
so
many
unaccustomed
things
at
once
he
had
to
eat
as
he
had
never
eaten
before
to
handle
strange
tools
to
glance
surreptitiously
about
and
learn
how
to
accomplish
each
new
thing
to
receive
the
flood
of
impressions
that
was
pouring
in
upon
him
and
being
mentally
annotated
and
classified
to
be
conscious
of
a
yearning
for
her
that
perturbed
him
in
the
form
of
a
dull
aching
restlessness
to
feel
the
prod
of
desire
to
win
to
the
walk
in
life
whereon
she
trod
and
to
have
his
mind
ever
and
again
straying
off
in
speculation
and
vague
plans
of
how
to
reach
to
her
also
when
his
secret
glance
went
across
to
norman
opposite
him
or
to
any
one
else
to
ascertain
just
what
knife
or
fork
was
to
be
used
in
any
particular
occasion
that
features
were
seized
upon
by
his
mind
which
automatically
strove
to
appraise
them
and
to
divine
what
they
in
relation
to
her
then
he
had
to
talk
to
hear
what
was
said
to
him
and
what
was
said
back
and
forth
and
to
answer
when
it
was
necessary
with
a
tongue
prone
to
looseness
of
speech
that
required
a
constant
curb
and
to
add
confusion
to
confusion
there
was
the
servant
an
unceasing
menace
that
appeared
noiselessly
at
his
shoulder
a
dire
sphinx
that
propounded
puzzles
and
conundrums
demanding
instantaneous
solution
he
was
oppressed
throughout
the
meal
by
the
thought
of
irrelevantly
insistently
scores
of
times
he
wondered
when
they
would
come
on
and
what
they
looked
like
he
had
heard
of
such
things
and
now
sooner
or
later
somewhere
in
the
next
few
minutes
he
would
see
them
sit
at
table
with
exalted
beings
who
used
and
he
would
use
them
himself
and
most
important
of
all
far
down
and
yet
always
at
the
surface
of
his
thought
was
the
problem
of
how
he
should
comport
himself
toward
these
persons
what
should
his
attitude
be
he
wrestled
continually
and
anxiously
with
the
problem
there
were
cowardly
suggestions
that
he
should
make
believe
assume
a
part
and
there
were
still
more
cowardly
suggestions
that
warned
him
he
would
fail
in
such
course
that
his
nature
was
not
fitted
to
live
up
to
it
and
that
he
would
make
a
fool
of
himself
it
was
during
the
first
part
of
the
dinner
struggling
to
decide
upon
his
attitude
that
he
was
very
quiet
he
did
not
know
that
his
quietness
was
giving
the
lie
to
words
of
the
day
before
when
that
brother
of
hers
had
announced
that
he
was
going
to
bring
a
wild
man
home
to
dinner
and
for
them
not
to
be
alarmed
because
they
would
find
him
an
interesting
wild
man
martin
eden
could
not
have
found
it
in
him
just
then
to
believe
that
her
brother
could
be
guilty
of
such
when
he
had
been
the
means
of
getting
this
particular
brother
out
of
an
unpleasant
row
so
he
sat
at
table
perturbed
by
his
own
unfitness
and
at
the
same
time
charmed
by
all
that
went
on
about
him
for
the
first
time
he
realized
that
eating
was
something
more
than
a
utilitarian
function
he
was
unaware
of
what
he
ate
it
was
merely
food
he
was
feasting
his
love
of
beauty
at
this
table
where
eating
was
an
aesthetic
function
it
was
an
intellectual
function
too
his
mind
was
stirred
he
heard
words
spoken
that
were
meaningless
to
him
and
other
words
that
he
had
seen
only
in
books
and
that
no
man
or
woman
he
had
known
was
of
large
enough
mental
caliber
to
pronounce
when
he
heard
such
words
dropping
carelessly
from
the
lips
of
the
members
of
this
marvellous
family
her
family
he
thrilled
with
delight
the
romance
and
beauty
and
high
vigor
of
the
books
were
coming
true
he
was
in
that
rare
and
blissful
state
wherein
a
man
sees
his
dreams
stalk
out
from
the
crannies
of
fantasy
and
become
fact
never
had
he
been
at
such
an
altitude
of
living
and
he
kept
himself
in
the
background
listening
observing
and
pleasuring
replying
in
reticent
monosyllables
saying
miss
and
miss
to
her
and
and
to
her
mother
he
curbed
the
impulse
arising
out
of
his
to
say
sir
and
sir
to
her
brothers
he
felt
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
and
a
confession
of
inferiority
on
his
would
never
do
if
he
was
to
win
to
her
also
it
was
a
dictate
of
his
pride
god
he
cried
to
himself
once
just
as
good
as
them
and
if
they
do
know
lots
that
i
i
could
learn
a
few
myself
all
the
same
and
the
next
moment
when
she
or
her
mother
addressed
him
as
eden
his
aggressive
pride
was
forgotten
and
he
was
glowing
and
warm
with
delight
he
was
a
civilized
man
that
was
what
he
was
shoulder
to
shoulder
at
dinner
with
people
he
had
read
about
in
books
he
was
in
the
books
himself
adventuring
through
the
printed
pages
of
bound
volumes
but
while
he
belied
description
and
appeared
a
gentle
lamb
rather
than
a
wild
man
he
was
racking
his
brains
for
a
course
of
action
he
was
no
gentle
lamb
and
the
part
of
second
fiddle
would
never
do
for
the
dominance
of
his
nature
he
talked
only
when
he
had
to
and
then
his
speech
was
like
his
walk
to
the
table
filled
with
jerks
and
halts
as
he
groped
in
his
polyglot
vocabulary
for
words
debating
over
words
he
knew
were
fit
but
which
he
feared
he
could
not
pronounce
rejecting
other
words
he
knew
would
not
be
understood
or
would
be
raw
and
harsh
but
all
the
time
he
was
oppressed
by
the
consciousness
that
this
carefulness
of
diction
was
making
a
booby
of
him
preventing
him
from
expressing
what
he
had
in
him
also
his
love
of
freedom
chafed
against
the
restriction
in
much
the
same
way
his
neck
chafed
against
the
starched
fetter
of
a
collar
besides
he
was
confident
that
he
could
not
keep
it
up
he
was
by
nature
powerful
of
thought
and
sensibility
and
the
creative
spirit
was
restive
and
urgent
he
was
swiftly
mastered
by
the
concept
or
sensation
in
him
that
struggled
in
to
receive
expression
and
form
and
then
he
forgot
himself
and
where
he
was
and
the
old
tools
of
speech
he
out
once
he
declined
something
from
the
servant
who
interrupted
and
pestered
at
his
shoulder
and
he
said
shortly
and
emphatically
on
the
instant
those
at
the
table
were
keyed
up
and
expectant
the
servant
was
smugly
pleased
and
he
was
wallowing
in
mortification
but
he
recovered
himself
quickly
the
kanaka
for
he
explained
it
just
come
out
naturally
spelt
he
caught
her
curious
and
speculative
eyes
fixed
on
his
hands
and
being
in
explanatory
mood
he
said
just
come
down
the
coast
on
one
of
the
pacific
mail
steamers
she
was
behind
time
around
the
puget
sound
ports
we
worked
like
niggers
storing
freight
if
you
know
what
that
means
how
the
skin
got
knocked
it
that
she
hastened
to
explain
in
turn
hands
seemed
too
small
for
your
his
cheeks
were
hot
he
took
it
as
an
exposure
of
another
of
his
deficiencies
he
said
depreciatingly
big
enough
to
stand
the
strain
i
can
hit
like
a
mule
with
my
arms
and
shoulders
they
are
too
strong
when
i
smash
a
man
on
the
jaw
the
hands
get
smashed
he
was
not
happy
at
what
he
had
said
he
was
filled
with
disgust
at
himself
he
had
loosed
the
guard
upon
his
tongue
and
talked
about
things
that
were
not
nice
was
brave
of
you
to
help
arthur
the
way
you
you
a
stranger
she
said
tactfully
aware
of
his
discomfiture
though
not
of
the
reason
for
it
he
in
turn
realized
what
she
had
done
and
in
the
consequent
warm
surge
of
gratefulness
that
overwhelmed
him
forgot
his
tongue
at
all
he
said
guy
do
it
for
another
that
bunch
of
hoodlums
was
for
trouble
arthur
none
they
butted
in
on
then
i
butted
in
on
them
poked
a
few
where
some
of
the
skin
off
my
hands
went
along
with
some
of
the
teeth
of
the
gang
i
missed
it
for
anything
when
i
he
paused
on
the
verge
of
the
pit
of
his
own
depravity
and
utter
worthlessness
to
breathe
the
same
air
she
did
and
while
arthur
took
up
the
tale
for
the
twentieth
time
of
his
adventure
with
the
drunken
hoodlums
on
the
and
of
how
martin
eden
had
rushed
in
and
rescued
him
that
individual
with
frowning
brows
meditated
upon
the
fool
he
had
made
of
himself
and
wrestled
more
determinedly
with
the
problem
of
how
he
should
conduct
himself
toward
these
people
he
certainly
had
not
succeeded
so
far
he
of
their
tribe
and
he
talk
their
lingo
was
the
way
he
put
it
to
himself
he
fake
being
their
kind
the
masquerade
would
fail
and
besides
masquerade
was
foreign
to
his
nature
there
was
no
room
in
him
for
sham
or
artifice
whatever
happened
he
must
be
real
he
talk
their
talk
just
yet
though
in
time
he
would
upon
that
he
was
resolved
but
in
the
meantime
talk
he
must
and
it
must
be
his
own
talk
toned
down
of
course
so
as
to
be
comprehensible
to
them
and
so
as
not
to
shock
them
too
much
and
furthermore
he
claim
not
even
by
tacit
acceptance
to
be
familiar
with
anything
that
was
unfamiliar
in
pursuance
of
this
decision
when
the
two
brothers
talking
university
shop
had
used
several
times
martin
eden
demanded
is
norman
said
higher
form
of
what
is
math
was
the
next
question
which
somehow
brought
the
laugh
on
norman
arithmetic
was
the
answer
martin
eden
nodded
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
apparently
illimitable
vistas
of
knowledge
what
he
saw
took
on
tangibility
his
abnormal
power
of
vision
made
abstractions
take
on
concrete
form
in
the
alchemy
of
his
brain
trigonometry
and
mathematics
and
the
whole
field
of
knowledge
which
they
betokened
were
transmuted
into
so
much
landscape
the
vistas
he
saw
were
vistas
of
green
foliage
and
forest
glades
all
softly
luminous
or
shot
through
with
flashing
lights
in
the
distance
detail
was
veiled
and
blurred
by
a
purple
haze
but
behind
this
purple
haze
he
knew
was
the
glamour
of
the
unknown
the
lure
of
romance
it
was
like
wine
to
him
here
was
adventure
something
to
do
with
head
and
hand
a
world
to
straightway
from
the
back
of
his
consciousness
rushed
the
thought
to
win
to
her
that
spirit
sitting
beside
the
glimmering
vision
was
rent
asunder
and
dissipated
by
arthur
who
all
evening
had
been
trying
to
draw
his
wild
man
out
martin
eden
remembered
his
decision
for
the
first
time
he
became
himself
consciously
and
deliberately
at
first
but
soon
lost
in
the
joy
of
creating
in
making
life
as
he
knew
it
appear
before
his
eyes
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
crew
of
the
smuggling
schooner
when
she
was
captured
by
a
revenue
cutter
he
saw
with
wide
eyes
and
he
could
tell
what
he
saw
he
brought
the
pulsing
sea
before
them
and
the
men
and
the
ships
upon
the
sea
he
communicated
his
power
of
vision
till
they
saw
with
his
eyes
what
he
had
seen
he
selected
from
the
vast
mass
of
detail
with
an
touch
drawing
pictures
of
life
that
glowed
and
burned
with
light
and
color
injecting
movement
so
that
his
listeners
surged
along
with
him
on
the
flood
of
rough
eloquence
enthusiasm
and
power
at
times
he
shocked
them
with
the
vividness
of
the
narrative
and
his
terms
of
speech
but
beauty
always
followed
fast
upon
the
heels
of
violence
and
tragedy
was
relieved
by
humor
by
interpretations
of
the
strange
twists
and
quirks
of
minds
and
while
he
talked
the
girl
looked
at
him
with
startled
eyes
his
fire
warmed
her
she
wondered
if
she
had
been
cold
all
her
days
she
wanted
to
lean
toward
this
burning
blazing
man
that
was
like
a
volcano
spouting
forth
strength
robustness
and
health
she
felt
that
she
must
lean
toward
him
and
resisted
by
an
effort
then
too
there
was
the
counter
impulse
to
shrink
away
from
him
she
was
repelled
by
those
lacerated
hands
grimed
by
toil
so
that
the
very
dirt
of
life
was
ingrained
in
the
flesh
itself
by
that
red
chafe
of
the
collar
and
those
bulging
muscles
his
roughness
frightened
her
each
roughness
of
speech
was
an
insult
to
her
ear
each
rough
phase
of
his
life
an
insult
to
her
soul
and
ever
and
again
would
come
the
draw
of
him
till
she
thought
he
must
be
evil
to
have
such
power
over
her
all
that
was
most
firmly
established
in
her
mind
was
rocking
his
romance
and
adventure
were
battering
at
the
conventions
before
his
facile
perils
and
ready
laugh
life
was
no
longer
an
affair
of
serious
effort
and
restraint
but
a
toy
to
be
played
with
and
turned
carelessly
to
be
lived
and
pleasured
in
and
carelessly
to
be
flung
aside
play
was
the
cry
that
rang
through
her
toward
him
if
so
you
will
and
place
your
two
hands
upon
his
neck
she
wanted
to
cry
out
at
the
recklessness
of
the
thought
and
in
vain
she
appraised
her
own
cleanness
and
culture
and
balanced
all
that
she
was
against
what
he
was
not
she
glanced
about
her
and
saw
the
others
gazing
at
him
with
rapt
attention
and
she
would
have
despaired
had
not
she
seen
horror
in
her
horror
it
was
true
but
none
the
less
horror
this
man
from
outer
darkness
was
evil
her
mother
saw
it
and
her
mother
was
right
she
would
trust
her
judgment
in
this
as
she
had
always
trusted
it
in
all
things
the
fire
of
him
was
no
longer
warm
and
the
fear
of
him
was
no
longer
poignant
later
at
the
piano
she
played
for
him
and
at
him
aggressively
with
the
vague
intent
of
emphasizing
the
impassableness
of
the
gulf
that
separated
them
her
music
was
a
club
that
she
swung
brutally
upon
his
head
and
though
it
stunned
him
and
crushed
him
down
it
incited
him
he
gazed
upon
her
in
awe
in
his
mind
as
in
her
own
the
gulf
widened
but
faster
than
it
widened
towered
his
ambition
to
win
across
it
but
he
was
too
complicated
a
plexus
of
sensibilities
to
sit
staring
at
a
gulf
a
whole
evening
especially
when
there
was
music
he
was
remarkably
susceptible
to
music
it
was
like
strong
drink
firing
him
to
audacities
of
feeling
drug
that
laid
hold
of
his
imagination
and
went
through
the
sky
it
banished
sordid
fact
flooded
his
mind
with
beauty
loosed
romance
and
to
its
heels
added
wings
he
did
not
understand
the
music
she
played
it
was
different
from
the
and
blatant
brass
bands
he
had
heard
but
he
had
caught
hints
of
such
music
from
the
books
and
he
accepted
her
playing
largely
on
faith
patiently
waiting
at
first
for
the
lilting
measures
of
pronounced
and
simple
rhythm
puzzled
because
those
measures
were
not
long
continued
just
as
he
caught
the
swing
of
them
and
started
his
imagination
attuned
in
flight
always
they
vanished
away
in
a
chaotic
scramble
of
sounds
that
was
meaningless
to
him
and
that
dropped
his
imagination
an
inert
weight
back
to
earth
once
it
entered
his
mind
that
there
was
a
deliberate
rebuff
in
all
this
he
caught
her
spirit
of
antagonism
and
strove
to
divine
the
message
that
her
hands
pronounced
upon
the
keys
then
he
dismissed
the
thought
as
unworthy
and
impossible
and
yielded
himself
more
freely
to
the
music
the
old
delightful
condition
began
to
be
induced
his
feet
were
no
longer
clay
and
his
flesh
became
spirit
before
his
eyes
and
behind
his
eyes
shone
a
great
glory
and
then
the
scene
before
him
vanished
and
he
was
away
rocking
over
the
world
that
was
to
him
a
very
dear
world
the
known
and
the
unknown
were
commingled
in
the
that
thronged
his
vision
he
entered
strange
ports
of
lands
and
trod
among
barbaric
peoples
that
no
man
had
ever
seen
the
scent
of
the
spice
islands
was
in
his
nostrils
as
he
had
known
it
on
warm
breathless
nights
at
sea
or
he
beat
up
against
the
southeast
trades
through
long
tropic
days
sinking
coral
islets
in
the
turquoise
sea
behind
and
lifting
coral
islets
in
the
turquoise
sea
ahead
swift
as
thought
the
pictures
came
and
went
one
instant
he
was
astride
a
broncho
and
flying
through
the
painted
desert
country
the
next
instant
he
was
gazing
down
through
shimmering
heat
into
the
whited
sepulchre
of
death
valley
or
pulling
an
oar
on
a
freezing
ocean
where
great
ice
islands
towered
and
glistened
in
the
sun
he
lay
on
a
coral
beach
where
the
cocoanuts
grew
down
to
the
surf
the
hulk
of
an
ancient
wreck
burned
with
blue
fires
in
the
light
of
which
danced
the
dancers
to
the
barbaric
of
the
singers
who
chanted
to
tinkling
and
rumbling
it
was
a
sensuous
tropic
night
in
the
background
a
volcano
crater
was
silhouetted
against
the
stars
overhead
drifted
a
pale
crescent
moon
and
the
southern
cross
burned
low
in
the
sky
he
was
a
harp
all
life
that
he
had
known
and
that
was
his
consciousness
was
the
strings
and
the
flood
of
music
was
a
wind
that
poured
against
those
strings
and
set
them
vibrating
with
memories
and
dreams
he
did
not
merely
feel
sensation
invested
itself
in
form
and
color
and
radiance
and
what
his
imagination
dared
it
objectified
in
some
sublimated
and
magic
way
past
present
and
future
mingled
and
he
went
on
oscillating
across
the
broad
warm
world
through
high
adventure
and
noble
deeds
to
and
with
her
winning
her
his
arm
about
her
and
carrying
her
on
in
flight
through
the
empery
of
his
mind
and
she
glancing
at
him
across
her
shoulder
saw
something
of
all
this
in
his
face
it
was
a
transfigured
face
with
great
shining
eyes
that
gazed
beyond
the
veil
of
sound
and
saw
behind
it
the
leap
and
pulse
of
life
and
the
gigantic
phantoms
of
the
spirit
she
was
startled
the
raw
stumbling
lout
was
gone
the
clothes
battered
hands
and
sunburned
face
remained
but
these
seemed
the
through
which
she
saw
a
great
soul
looking
forth
inarticulate
and
dumb
because
of
those
feeble
lips
that
would
not
give
it
speech
only
for
a
flashing
moment
did
she
see
this
then
she
saw
the
lout
returned
and
she
laughed
at
the
whim
of
her
fancy
but
the
impression
of
that
fleeting
glimpse
lingered
and
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
beat
a
stumbling
retreat
and
go
she
lent
him
the
volume
of
swinburne
and
another
of
was
studying
browning
in
one
of
her
english
courses
he
seemed
such
a
boy
as
he
stood
blushing
and
stammering
his
thanks
that
a
wave
of
pity
maternal
in
its
prompting
welled
up
in
her
she
did
not
remember
the
lout
nor
the
imprisoned
soul
nor
the
man
who
had
stared
at
her
in
all
masculineness
and
delighted
and
frightened
her
she
saw
before
her
only
a
boy
who
was
shaking
her
hand
with
a
hand
so
calloused
that
it
felt
like
a
and
rasped
her
skin
and
who
was
saying
jerkily
greatest
time
of
my
life
you
see
i
used
to
things
he
looked
about
him
helplessly
people
and
houses
like
this
all
new
to
me
and
i
like
hope
call
again
she
said
as
he
was
saying
good
night
to
her
brothers
he
pulled
on
his
cap
lurched
desperately
through
the
doorway
and
was
gone
what
do

think
of
him
arthur
demanded
is
most
interesting
a
whiff
of
ozone

answered

i
asked

afternoon

and
i

three
years
older

the
thought
in
her
mind
as
she
kissed
her
brothers
goodnight
chapter
iii
as
martin
eden
went
down
the
steps
his
hand
dropped
into
his
coat
pocket
it
came
out
with
a
brown
rice
paper
and
a
pinch
of
mexican
tobacco
which
were
deftly
rolled
together
into
a
cigarette
he
drew
the
first
whiff
of
smoke
deep
into
his
lungs
and
expelled
it
in
a
long
and
lingering
exhalation
god
he
said
aloud
in
a
voice
of
awe
and
wonder
god
he
repeated
and
yet
again
he
murmured
god
then
his
hand
went
to
his
collar
which
he
ripped
out
of
the
shirt
and
stuffed
into
his
pocket
a
cold
drizzle
was
falling
but
he
bared
his
head
to
it
and
unbuttoned
his
vest
swinging
along
in
splendid
unconcern
he
was
only
dimly
aware
that
it
was
raining
he
was
in
an
ecstasy
dreaming
dreams
and
reconstructing
the
scenes
just
past
he
had
met
the
woman
at
woman
that
he
had
thought
little
about
not
being
given
to
thinking
about
women
but
whom
he
had
expected
in
a
remote
way
he
would
sometime
meet
he
had
sat
next
to
her
at
table
he
had
felt
her
hand
in
his
he
had
looked
into
her
eyes
and
caught
a
vision
of
a
beautiful
spirit
no
more
beautiful
than
the
eyes
through
which
it
shone
nor
than
the
flesh
that
gave
it
expression
and
form
he
did
not
think
of
her
flesh
as
flesh
was
new
to
him
for
of
the
women
he
had
known
that
was
the
only
way
he
thought
her
flesh
was
somehow
different
he
did
not
conceive
of
her
body
as
a
body
subject
to
the
ills
and
frailties
of
bodies
her
body
was
more
than
the
garb
of
her
spirit
it
was
an
emanation
of
her
spirit
a
pure
and
gracious
crystallization
of
her
divine
essence
this
feeling
of
the
divine
startled
him
it
shocked
him
from
his
dreams
to
sober
thought
no
word
no
clew
no
hint
of
the
divine
had
ever
reached
him
before
he
had
never
believed
in
the
divine
he
had
always
been
irreligious
scoffing
at
the
and
their
immortality
of
the
soul
there
was
no
life
beyond
he
had
contended
it
was
here
and
now
then
darkness
everlasting
but
what
he
had
seen
in
her
eyes
was
soul
that
could
never
die
no
man
he
had
known
nor
any
woman
had
given
him
the
message
of
immortality
but
she
had
she
had
whispered
it
to
him
the
first
moment
she
looked
at
him
her
face
shimmered
before
his
eyes
as
he
walked
along
and
serious
sweet
and
sensitive
smiling
with
pity
and
tenderness
as
only
a
spirit
could
smile
and
pure
as
he
had
never
dreamed
purity
could
be
her
purity
smote
him
like
a
blow
it
startled
him
he
had
known
good
and
bad
but
purity
as
an
attribute
of
existence
had
never
entered
his
mind
and
now
in
her
he
conceived
purity
to
be
the
superlative
of
goodness
and
of
cleanness
the
sum
of
which
constituted
eternal
life
and
promptly
urged
his
ambition
to
grasp
at
eternal
life
he
was
not
fit
to
carry
water
for
knew
that
it
was
a
miracle
of
luck
and
a
fantastic
stroke
that
had
enabled
him
to
see
her
and
be
with
her
and
talk
with
her
that
night
it
was
accidental
there
was
no
merit
in
it
he
did
not
deserve
such
fortune
his
mood
was
essentially
religious
he
was
humble
and
meek
filled
with
and
abasement
in
such
frame
of
mind
sinners
come
to
the
penitent
form
he
was
convicted
of
sin
but
as
the
meek
and
lowly
at
the
penitent
form
catch
splendid
glimpses
of
their
future
lordly
existence
so
did
he
catch
similar
glimpses
of
the
state
he
would
gain
to
by
possessing
her
but
this
possession
of
her
was
dim
and
nebulous
and
totally
different
from
possession
as
he
had
known
it
ambition
soared
on
mad
wings
and
he
saw
himself
climbing
the
heights
with
her
sharing
thoughts
with
her
pleasuring
in
beautiful
and
noble
things
with
her
it
was
a
he
dreamed
refined
beyond
any
grossness
a
free
comradeship
of
spirit
that
he
could
not
put
into
definite
thought
he
did
not
think
it
for
that
matter
he
did
not
think
at
all
sensation
usurped
reason
and
he
was
quivering
and
palpitant
with
emotions
he
had
never
known
drifting
deliciously
on
a
sea
of
sensibility
where
feeling
itself
was
exalted
and
spiritualized
and
carried
beyond
the
summits
of
life
he
staggered
along
like
a
drunken
man
murmuring
fervently
aloud
god
by
god
a
policeman
on
a
street
corner
eyed
him
suspiciously
then
noted
his
sailor
roll
did
you
get
it
the
policeman
demanded
martin
eden
came
back
to
earth
his
was
a
fluid
organism
swiftly
adjustable
capable
of
flowing
into
and
filling
all
sorts
of
nooks
and
crannies
with
the
hail
he
was
immediately
his
ordinary
self
grasping
the
situation
clearly
a
beaut
it
he
laughed
back
know
i
was
out
be
singing
next
was
the
diagnosis
i
gim
me
a
match
catch
the
next
car
he
lighted
his
cigarette
said
good
night
and
went
on
that
rattle
you
he
ejaculated
under
his
breath
copper
thought
i
was
he
smiled
to
himself
and
meditated
guess
i
was
he
added
i
think
a
do
he
caught
a
telegraph
avenue
car
that
was
going
to
berkeley
it
was
crowded
with
youths
and
young
men
who
were
singing
songs
and
ever
and
again
barking
out
college
yells
he
studied
them
curiously
they
were
university
boys
they
went
to
the
same
university
that
she
did
were
in
her
class
socially
could
know
her
could
see
her
every
day
if
they
wanted
to
he
wondered
that
they
did
not
want
to
that
they
had
been
out
having
a
good
time
instead
of
being
with
her
that
evening
talking
with
her
sitting
around
her
in
a
worshipful
and
adoring
circle
his
thoughts
wandered
on
he
noticed
one
with
eyes
and
a
mouth
that
fellow
was
vicious
he
decided
on
shipboard
he
would
be
a
sneak
a
whiner
a
tattler
he
martin
eden
was
a
better
man
than
that
fellow
the
thought
cheered
him
it
seemed
to
draw
him
nearer
to
her
he
began
comparing
himself
with
the
students
he
grew
conscious
of
the
muscled
mechanism
of
his
body
and
felt
confident
that
he
was
physically
their
master
but
their
heads
were
filled
with
knowledge
that
enabled
them
to
talk
her
talk
thought
depressed
him
but
what
was
a
brain
for
he
demanded
passionately
what
they
had
done
he
could
do
they
had
been
studying
about
life
from
the
books
while
he
had
been
busy
living
life
his
brain
was
just
as
full
of
knowledge
as
theirs
though
it
was
a
different
kind
of
knowledge
how
many
of
them
could
tie
a
lanyard
knot
or
take
a
wheel
or
a
lookout
his
life
spread
out
before
him
in
a
series
of
pictures
of
danger
and
daring
hardship
and
toil
he
remembered
his
failures
and
scrapes
in
the
process
of
learning
he
was
that
much
to
the
good
anyway
later
on
they
would
have
to
begin
living
life
and
going
through
the
mill
as
he
had
gone
very
well
while
they
were
busy
with
that
he
could
be
learning
the
other
side
of
life
from
the
books
as
the
car
crossed
the
zone
of
scattered
dwellings
that
separated
oakland
from
berkeley
he
kept
a
lookout
for
a
familiar
building
along
the
front
of
which
ran
the
proud
sign
cash
store
martin
eden
got
off
at
this
corner
he
stared
up
for
a
moment
at
the
sign
it
carried
a
message
to
him
beyond
its
mere
wording
a
personality
of
smallness
and
egotism
and
petty
underhandedness
seemed
to
emanate
from
the
letters
themselves
bernard
higginbotham
had
married
his
sister
and
he
knew
him
well
he
let
himself
in
with
a
and
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
second
floor
here
lived
his
the
grocery
was
below
there
was
a
smell
of
stale
vegetables
in
the
air
as
he
groped
his
way
across
the
hall
he
stumbled
over
a
left
there
by
one
of
his
numerous
nephews
and
nieces
and
brought
up
against
a
door
with
a
resounding
bang
pincher
was
his
thought
miserly
to
burn
two
worth
of
gas
and
save
his
he
fumbled
for
the
knob
and
entered
a
lighted
room
where
sat
his
sister
and
bernard
higginbotham
she
was
patching
a
pair
of
his
trousers
while
his
lean
body
was
distributed
over
two
chairs
his
feet
dangling
in
dilapidated
over
the
edge
of
the
second
chair
he
glanced
across
the
top
of
the
paper
he
was
reading
showing
a
pair
of
dark
insincere
eyes
martin
eden
never
looked
at
him
without
experiencing
a
sense
of
repulsion
what
his
sister
had
seen
in
the
man
was
beyond
him
the
other
affected
him
as
so
much
vermin
and
always
aroused
in
him
an
impulse
to
crush
him
under
his
foot
day
beat
the
face
off
of
him
was
the
way
he
often
consoled
himself
for
enduring
the
existence
the
eyes
and
cruel
were
looking
at
him
complainingly
martin
demanded
with
had
that
door
painted
only
last
week
higginbotham
half
whined
half
bullied
you
know
what
union
wages
are
you
should
be
more
martin
had
intended
to
reply
but
he
was
struck
by
the
hopelessness
of
it
he
gazed
across
the
monstrous
sordidness
of
soul
to
a
chromo
on
the
wall
it
surprised
him
he
had
always
liked
it
but
it
seemed
that
now
he
was
seeing
it
for
the
first
time
it
was
cheap
that
was
what
it
was
like
everything
else
in
this
house
his
mind
went
back
to
the
house
he
had
just
left
and
he
saw
first
the
paintings
and
next
her
looking
at
him
with
melting
sweetness
as
she
shook
his
hand
at
leaving
he
forgot
where
he
was
and
bernard
existence
till
that
gentleman
demanded
a
ghost
martin
came
back
and
looked
at
the
beady
eyes
sneering
truculent
cowardly
and
there
leaped
into
his
vision
as
on
a
screen
the
same
eyes
when
their
owner
was
making
a
sale
in
the
store
eyes
smug
and
oily
and
flattering
martin
answered
seen
a
ghost
good
night
good
night
he
started
to
leave
the
room
tripping
over
a
loose
seam
in
the
slatternly
carpet
bang
the
door
higginbotham
cautioned
him
he
felt
the
blood
crawl
in
his
veins
but
controlled
himself
and
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
higginbotham
looked
at
his
wife
exultantly
ben
he
proclaimed
in
a
hoarse
whisper
told
you
he
she
nodded
her
head
resignedly
eyes
was
pretty
shiny
she
confessed
he
have
no
collar
though
he
went
away
with
one
but
mebbe
he
have
a
couple
of
stand
up
straight
asserted
her
husband
watched
him
he
walk
across
the
floor
without
you
heard
yourself
almost
fall
down
in
the
think
it
was
over
cart
she
said
see
it
in
the
voice
and
wrath
began
to
rise
all
day
he
effaced
himself
in
the
store
reserving
for
the
evening
with
his
family
the
privilege
of
being
himself
tell
you
that
precious
brother
of
yours
was
his
voice
was
cold
sharp
and
final
his
lips
stamping
the
enunciation
of
each
word
like
the
die
of
a
machine
his
wife
sighed
and
remained
silent
she
was
a
large
stout
woman
always
dressed
slatternly
and
always
tired
from
the
burdens
of
her
flesh
her
work
and
her
husband
got
it
in
him
i
tell
you
from
his
father
higginbotham
went
on
accusingly
croak
in
the
gutter
the
same
way
you
know
she
nodded
sighed
and
went
on
stitching
they
were
agreed
that
martin
had
come
home
drunk
they
did
not
have
it
in
their
souls
to
know
beauty
or
they
would
have
known
that
those
shining
eyes
and
that
glowing
face
betokened
first
vision
of
love
a
fine
example
to
the
children
higginbotham
snorted
suddenly
in
the
silence
for
which
his
wife
was
responsible
and
which
he
resented
sometimes
he
almost
wished
she
would
oppose
him
more
he
does
it
again
got
to
get
out
understand
i
put
up
with
his
innocent
children
with
his
higginbotham
liked
the
word
which
was
a
new
one
in
his
vocabulary
recently
gleaned
from
a
newspaper
column
what
it
is
no
other
name
for
still
his
wife
sighed
shook
her
head
sorrowfully
and
stitched
on
higginbotham
resumed
the
newspaper
he
paid
last
board
he
shot
across
the
top
of
the
newspaper
she
nodded
then
added
still
has
some
is
he
to
sea
again
his
spent
i
guess
she
answered
was
over
to
san
francisco

looking
for
a
ship
but

money
yet
particular
about
the
kind
of
ship
he
signs
not
for
a
like
him
to
put
on
airs
higginbotham
snorted
him
said
something
about
a
schooner
ready
to
go
off
to
some
outlandish
place
to
look
for
buried
treasure
that
sail
on
her
if
his
money
held
he
only
wanted
to
steady
down
give
him
a
job
the
wagon
her
husband
said
but
with
no
trace
of
benevolence
in
his
voice
his
wife
looked
alarm
and
interrogation
is
to
work
for
carruthers
they
paid
i
could

cried
out

she
sniffled

a
good
her
husband
glared
at
her
this
was
unqualified
defiance

worth
his
salt
he
could
take

he
snorted

board
just
the
same

the
retort

brother
so
long
as

time

he
demanded
higginbotham
made
no
reply
her
revolt
faded
away
her
spirit
wilting
down
into
her
tired
flesh
her
husband
was
triumphant
he
had
her
his
eyes
snapped
vindictively
while
his
ears
joyed
in
the
sniffles
she
emitted
he
extracted
great
happiness
from
squelching
her
and
she
squelched
easily
these
days
though
it
had
been
different
in
the
first
years
of
their
married
life
before
the
brood
of
children
and
his
incessant
nagging
had
sapped
her
energy
you
tell
all
he
said
i
just
want
to
tell
you
before
i
forget
it

your
mind

wash

she
objected
weakly
up
early
then
do
it
first
i
start
out
till

he
crinkled
the
paper
viciously
and
resumed
his
reading
chapter
iv
martin
eden
with
blood
still
crawling
from
contact
with
his
felt
his
way
along
the
unlighted
back
hall
and
entered
his
room
a
tiny
cubbyhole
with
space
for
a
bed
a
and
one
chair
higginbotham
was
too
thrifty
to
keep
a
servant
when
his
wife
could
do
the
work
besides
the
room
enabled
them
to
take
in
two
boarders
instead
of
one
martin
placed
the
swinburne
and
browning
on
the
chair
took
off
his
coat
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
a
screeching
of
asthmatic
springs
greeted
the
weight
of
his
body
but
he
did
not
notice
them
he
started
to
take
off
his
shoes
but
fell
to
staring
at
the
white
plaster
wall
opposite
him
broken
by
long
streaks
of
dirty
brown
where
rain
had
leaked
through
the
roof
on
this
befouled
background
visions
began
to
flow
and
burn
he
forgot
his
shoes
and
stared
long
till
his
lips
began
to
move
and
he
murmured
he
had
not
thought
a
simple
sound
could
be
so
beautiful
it
delighted
his
ear
and
he
grew
intoxicated
with
the
repetition
of
it
it
was
a
talisman
a
magic
word
to
conjure
with
each
time
he
murmured
it
her
face
shimmered
before
him
suffusing
the
foul
wall
with
a
golden
radiance
this
radiance
did
not
stop
at
the
wall
it
extended
on
into
infinity
and
through
its
golden
depths
his
soul
went
questing
after
hers
the
best
that
was
in
him
was
out
in
splendid
flood
the
very
thought
of
her
ennobled
and
purified
him
made
him
better
and
made
him
want
to
be
better
this
was
new
to
him
he
had
never
known
women
who
had
made
him
better
they
had
always
had
the
counter
effect
of
making
him
beastly
he
did
not
know
that
many
of
them
had
done
their
best
bad
as
it
was
never
having
been
conscious
of
himself
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
that
in
his
being
that
drew
love
from
women
and
which
had
been
the
cause
of
their
reaching
out
for
his
youth
though
they
had
often
bothered
him
he
had
never
bothered
about
them
and
he
would
never
have
dreamed
that
there
were
women
who
had
been
better
because
of
him
always
in
sublime
carelessness
had
he
lived
till
now
and
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
had
always
reached
out
and
dragged
at
him
with
vile
hands
this
was
not
just
to
them
nor
to
himself
but
he
who
for
the
first
time
was
becoming
conscious
of
himself
was
in
no
condition
to
judge
and
he
burned
with
shame
as
he
stared
at
the
vision
of
his
infamy
he
got
up
abruptly
and
tried
to
see
himself
in
the
dirty
over
the
he
passed
a
towel
over
it
and
looked
again
long
and
carefully
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
really
seen
himself
his
eyes
were
made
for
seeing
but
up
to
that
moment
they
had
been
filled
with
the
ever
changing
panorama
of
the
world
at
which
he
had
been
too
busy
gazing
ever
to
gaze
at
himself
he
saw
the
head
and
face
of
a
young
fellow
of
twenty
but
being
unused
to
such
appraisement
he
did
not
know
how
to
value
it
above
a
forehead
he
saw
a
mop
of
brown
hair
with
a
wave
to
it
and
hints
of
curls
that
were
a
delight
to
any
woman
making
hands
tingle
to
stroke
it
and
fingers
tingle
to
pass
caresses
through
it
but
he
passed
it
by
as
without
merit
in
her
eyes
and
dwelt
long
and
thoughtfully
on
the
high
square
forehead
to
penetrate
it
and
learn
the
quality
of
its
content
what
kind
of
a
brain
lay
behind
there
was
his
insistent
interrogation
what
was
it
capable
of
how
far
would
it
take
him
would
it
take
him
to
her
he
wondered
if
there
was
soul
in
those
eyes
that
were
often
quite
blue
of
color
and
that
were
strong
with
the
briny
airs
of
the
deep
he
wondered
also
how
his
eyes
looked
to
her
he
tried
to
imagine
himself
she
gazing
into
those
eyes
of
his
but
failed
in
the
jugglery
he
could
successfully
put
himself
inside
other
minds
but
they
had
to
be
men
whose
ways
of
life
he
knew
he
did
not
know
her
way
of
life
she
was
wonder
and
mystery
and
how
could
he
guess
one
thought
of
hers
well
they
were
honest
eyes
he
concluded
and
in
them
was
neither
smallness
nor
meanness
the
brown
sunburn
of
his
face
surprised
him
he
had
not
dreamed
he
was
so
black
he
rolled
up
his
and
compared
the
white
underside
of
the
arm
with
his
face
yes
he
was
a
white
man
after
all
but
the
arms
were
sunburned
too
he
twisted
his
arm
rolled
the
biceps
over
with
his
other
hand
and
gazed
underneath
where
he
was
least
touched
by
the
sun
it
was
very
white
he
laughed
at
his
bronzed
face
in
the
glass
at
the
thought
that
it
was
once
as
white
as
the
underside
of
his
arm
nor
did
he
dream
that
in
the
world
there
were
few
pale
spirits
of
women
who
could
boast
fairer
or
smoother
skins
than
than
where
he
had
escaped
the
ravages
of
the
sun
his
might
have
been
a
mouth
had
not
the
full
sensuous
lips
a
trick
under
stress
of
drawing
firmly
across
the
teeth
at
times
so
tightly
did
they
draw
the
mouth
became
stern
and
harsh
even
ascetic
they
were
the
lips
of
a
fighter
and
of
a
lover
they
could
taste
the
sweetness
of
life
with
relish
and
they
could
put
the
sweetness
aside
and
command
life
the
chin
and
jaw
strong
and
just
hinting
of
square
aggressiveness
helped
the
lips
to
command
life
strength
balanced
sensuousness
and
had
upon
it
a
tonic
effect
compelling
him
to
love
beauty
that
was
healthy
and
making
him
vibrate
to
sensations
that
were
wholesome
and
between
the
lips
were
teeth
that
had
never
known
nor
needed
the
care
they
were
white
and
strong
and
regular
he
decided
as
he
looked
at
them
but
as
he
looked
he
began
to
be
troubled
somewhere
stored
away
in
the
recesses
of
his
mind
and
vaguely
remembered
was
the
impression
that
there
were
people
who
washed
their
teeth
every
day
they
were
the
people
from
up
in
her
class
she
must
wash
her
teeth
every
day
too
what
would
she
think
if
she
learned
that
he
had
never
washed
his
teeth
in
all
the
days
of
his
life
he
resolved
to
get
a
and
form
the
habit
he
would
begin
at
once
it
was
not
by
mere
achievement
that
he
could
hope
to
win
to
her
he
must
make
a
personal
reform
in
all
things
even
to
and
though
a
starched
collar
affected
him
as
a
renunciation
of
freedom
he
held
up
his
hand
rubbing
the
ball
of
the
thumb
over
the
calloused
palm
and
gazing
at
the
dirt
that
was
ingrained
in
the
flesh
itself
and
which
no
brush
could
scrub
away
how
different
was
her
palm
he
thrilled
deliciously
at
the
remembrance
like
a
he
thought
cool
and
soft
as
a
snowflake
he
had
never
thought
that
a
mere
hand
could
be
so
sweetly
soft
he
caught
himself
imagining
the
wonder
of
a
caress
from
such
a
hand
and
flushed
guiltily
it
was
too
gross
a
thought
for
her
in
ways
it
seemed
to
impugn
her
high
spirituality
she
was
a
pale
slender
spirit
exalted
far
beyond
the
flesh
but
nevertheless
the
softness
of
her
palm
persisted
in
his
thoughts
he
was
used
to
the
harsh
callousness
of
factory
girls
and
working
women
well
he
knew
why
their
hands
were
rough
but
this
hand
of
hers
it
was
soft
because
she
had
never
used
it
to
work
with
the
gulf
yawned
between
her
and
him
at
the
awesome
thought
of
a
person
who
did
not
have
to
work
for
a
living
he
suddenly
saw
the
aristocracy
of
the
people
who
did
not
labor
it
towered
before
him
on
the
wall
a
figure
in
brass
arrogant
and
powerful
he
had
worked
himself
his
first
memories
seemed
connected
with
work
and
all
his
family
had
worked
there
was
gertrude
when
her
hands
were
not
hard
from
the
endless
housework
they
were
swollen
and
red
like
boiled
beef
what
of
the
washing
and
there
was
his
sister
marian
she
had
worked
in
the
cannery
the
preceding
summer
and
her
slim
pretty
hands
were
all
scarred
with
the
besides
the
tips
of
two
of
her
fingers
had
been
left
in
the
cutting
machine
at
the
factory
the
preceding
winter
he
remembered
the
hard
palms
of
his
mother
as
she
lay
in
her
coffin
and
his
father
had
worked
to
the
last
fading
gasp
the
horned
growth
on
his
hands
must
have
been
half
an
inch
thick
when
he
died
but
her
hands
were
soft
and
her
hands
and
her
this
last
came
to
him
as
a
surprise
it
was
tremendously
indicative
of
the
highness
of
their
caste
of
the
enormous
distance
that
stretched
between
her
and
him
he
sat
back
on
the
bed
with
a
bitter
laugh
and
finished
taking
off
his
shoes
he
was
a
fool
he
had
been
made
drunken
by
a
face
and
by
a
soft
white
hands
and
then
suddenly
before
his
eyes
on
the
foul
appeared
a
vision
he
stood
in
front
of
a
gloomy
tenement
house
it
was
in
the
east
end
of
london
and
before
him
stood
margey
a
little
factory
girl
of
fifteen
he
had
seen
her
home
after
the
she
lived
in
that
gloomy
tenement
a
place
not
fit
for
swine
his
hand
was
going
out
to
hers
as
he
said
good
night
she
had
put
her
lips
up
to
be
kissed
but
he
going
to
kiss
her
somehow
he
was
afraid
of
her
and
then
her
hand
closed
on
his
and
pressed
feverishly
he
felt
her
callouses
grind
and
grate
on
his
and
a
great
wave
of
pity
welled
over
him
he
saw
her
yearning
hungry
eyes
and
her
female
form
which
had
been
rushed
from
childhood
into
a
frightened
and
ferocious
maturity
then
he
put
his
arms
about
her
in
large
tolerance
and
stooped
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
her
glad
little
cry
rang
in
his
ears
and
he
felt
her
clinging
to
him
like
a
cat
poor
little
starveling
he
continued
to
stare
at
the
vision
of
what
had
happened
in
the
long
ago
his
flesh
was
crawling
as
it
had
crawled
that
night
when
she
clung
to
him
and
his
heart
was
warm
with
pity
it
was
a
gray
scene
greasy
gray
and
the
rain
drizzled
greasily
on
the
pavement
stones
and
then
a
radiant
glory
shone
on
the
wall
and
up
through
the
other
vision
displacing
it
glimmered
her
pale
face
under
its
crown
of
golden
hair
remote
and
inaccessible
as
a
star
he
took
the
browning
and
the
swinburne
from
the
chair
and
kissed
them
just
the
same
she
told
me
to
call
again
he
thought
he
took
another
look
at
himself
in
the
glass
and
said
aloud
with
great
solemnity
eden
the
first
thing
you
go
to
the
free
library
read
up
on
etiquette
understand
he
turned
off
the
gas
and
the
springs
shrieked
under
his
body
got
to
quit
martin
old
boy
got
to
quit
he
said
aloud
then
he
dozed
off
to
sleep
and
to
dream
dreams
that
for
madness
and
audacity
rivalled
those
of
chapter
he
awoke
next
morning
from
rosy
scenes
of
dream
to
a
steamy
atmosphere
that
smelled
of
soapsuds
and
dirty
clothes
and
that
was
vibrant
with
the
jar
and
jangle
of
tormented
life
as
he
came
out
of
his
room
he
heard
the
slosh
of
water
a
sharp
exclamation
and
a
resounding
smack
as
his
sister
visited
her
irritation
upon
one
of
her
numerous
progeny
the
squall
of
the
child
went
through
him
like
a
knife
he
was
aware
that
the
whole
thing
the
very
air
he
breathed
was
repulsive
and
mean
how
different
he
thought
from
the
atmosphere
of
beauty
and
repose
of
the
house
wherein
ruth
dwelt
there
it
was
all
spiritual
here
it
was
all
material
and
meanly
material
here
alfred
he
called
to
the
crying
child
at
the
same
time
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
trousers
pocket
where
he
carried
his
money
loose
in
the
same
large
way
that
he
lived
life
in
general
he
put
a
quarter
in
the
hand
and
held
him
in
his
arms
a
moment
soothing
his
sobs
run
along
and
get
some
candy
and
forget
to
give
some
to
your
brothers
and
sisters
be
sure
and
get
the
kind
that
lasts
his
sister
lifted
a
flushed
face
from
the
and
looked
at
him
ben
enough
she
said
just
like
you
no
idea
of
the
value
of
money
the
eat
himself
all
right
sis
he
answered
jovially
take
care
of
itself
if
you
so
busy
kiss
you
good
he
wanted
to
be
affectionate
to
this
sister
who
was
good
and
who
in
her
way
he
knew
loved
him
but
somehow
she
grew
less
herself
as
the
years
went
by
and
more
and
more
baffling
it
was
the
hard
work
the
many
children
and
the
nagging
of
her
husband
he
decided
that
had
changed
her
it
came
to
him
in
a
flash
of
fancy
that
her
nature
seemed
taking
on
the
attributes
of
stale
vegetables
smelly
soapsuds
and
of
the
greasy
dimes
nickels
and
quarters
she
took
in
over
the
counter
of
the
store
along
get
your
breakfast
she
said
roughly
though
secretly
pleased
of
all
her
wandering
brood
of
brothers
he
had
always
been
her
favorite
declare
i
kiss
you
she
said
with
a
sudden
stir
at
her
heart
with
thumb
and
forefinger
she
swept
the
dripping
suds
first
from
one
arm
and
then
from
the
other
he
put
his
arms
round
her
massive
waist
and
kissed
her
wet
steamy
lips
the
tears
welled
into
her
so
much
from
strength
of
feeling
as
from
the
weakness
of
chronic
overwork
she
shoved
him
away
from
her
but
not
before
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
moist
eyes
find
breakfast
in
the
oven
she
said
hurriedly
ought
to
be
up
now
i
had
to
get
up
early
for
the
washing
now
get
along
with
you
and
get
out
of
the
house
early
it
be
nice
what
of
tom
nobody
but
bernard
to
drive
the
martin
went
into
the
kitchen
with
a
sinking
heart
the
image
of
her
red
face
and
slatternly
form
eating
its
way
like
acid
into
his
brain
she
might
love
him
if
she
only
had
some
time
he
concluded
but
she
was
worked
to
death
bernard
higginbotham
was
a
brute
to
work
her
so
hard
but
he
could
not
help
but
feel
on
the
other
hand
that
there
had
not
been
anything
beautiful
in
that
kiss
it
was
true
it
was
an
unusual
kiss
for
years
she
had
kissed
him
only
when
he
returned
from
voyages
or
departed
on
voyages
but
this
kiss
had
tasted
of
soapsuds
and
the
lips
he
had
noticed
were
flabby
there
had
been
no
quick
vigorous
such
as
should
accompany
any
kiss
hers
was
the
kiss
of
a
tired
woman
who
had
been
tired
so
long
that
she
had
forgotten
how
to
kiss
he
remembered
her
as
a
girl
before
her
marriage
when
she
would
dance
with
the
best
all
night
after
a
hard
work
at
the
laundry
and
think
nothing
of
leaving
the
dance
to
go
to
another
hard
work
and
then
he
thought
of
ruth
and
the
cool
sweetness
that
must
reside
in
her
lips
as
it
resided
in
all
about
her
her
kiss
would
be
like
her
or
the
way
she
looked
at
one
firm
and
frank
in
imagination
he
dared
to
think
of
her
lips
on
his
and
so
vividly
did
he
imagine
that
he
went
dizzy
at
the
thought
and
seemed
to
rift
through
clouds
of
filling
his
brain
with
their
perfume
in
the
kitchen
he
found
jim
the
other
boarder
eating
mush
very
languidly
with
a
sick
look
in
his
eyes
jim
was
a
apprentice
whose
weak
chin
and
hedonistic
temperament
coupled
with
a
certain
nervous
stupidity
promised
to
take
him
nowhere
in
the
race
for
bread
and
butter
you
eat
he
demanded
as
martin
dipped
dolefully
into
the
cold
oatmeal
mush
you
drunk
again
last
night
martin
shook
his
head
he
was
oppressed
by
the
utter
squalidness
of
it
all
ruth
morse
seemed
farther
removed
than
ever
was
jim
went
on
with
a
boastful
nervous
giggle
was
loaded
right
to
the
neck
oh
she
was
a
daisy
billy
brought
me
martin
nodded
that
he
heard
was
a
habit
of
nature
with
him
to
pay
heed
to
whoever
talked
to
him
poured
a
cup
of
lukewarm
coffee
to
the
lotus
club
dance
jim
demanded
to
have
beer
if
that
temescal
bunch
comes
be
a
i
care
though
my
lady
friend
just
the
same
cripes
but
got
a
taste
in
my
mouth
he
made
a
wry
face
and
attempted
to
wash
the
taste
away
with
coffee
know
julia
martin
shook
his
head
my
lady
friend
jim
explained
a
peach
introduce
you

martin

the

martin
shoved
his
plate
away
and
got
up
to
the
dance
the
other
called
after
him
i
think
not
he
answered
he
went
downstairs
and
out
into
the
street
breathing
great
breaths
of
air
he
had
been
suffocating
in
that
atmosphere
while
the
chatter
had
driven
him
frantic
there
had
been
times
when
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
refrain
from
reaching
over
and
mopping
face
in
the
the
more
he
had
chattered
the
more
remote
had
ruth
seemed
to
him
how
could
he
herding
with
such
cattle
ever
become
worthy
of
her
he
was
appalled
at
the
problem
confronting
him
weighted
down
by
the
incubus
of
his
station
everything
reached
out
to
hold
him
sister
his
house
and
family
jim
the
apprentice
everybody
he
knew
every
tie
of
life
existence
did
not
taste
good
in
his
mouth
up
to
then
he
had
accepted
existence
as
he
had
lived
it
with
all
about
him
as
a
good
thing
he
had
never
questioned
it
except
when
he
read
books
but
then
they
were
only
books
fairy
stories
of
a
fairer
and
impossible
world
but
now
he
had
seen
that
world
possible
and
real
with
a
flower
of
a
woman
called
ruth
in
the
midmost
centre
of
it
and
thenceforth
he
must
know
bitter
tastes
and
longings
sharp
as
pain
and
hopelessness
that
tantalized
because
it
fed
on
hope
he
had
debated
between
the
berkeley
free
library
and
the
oakland
free
library
and
decided
upon
the
latter
because
ruth
lived
in
oakland
who
could
tell
library
was
a
most
likely
place
for
her
and
he
might
see
her
there
he
did
not
know
the
way
of
libraries
and
he
wandered
through
endless
rows
of
fiction
till
the
girl
who
seemed
in
charge
told
him
that
the
reference
department
was
upstairs
he
did
not
know
enough
to
ask
the
man
at
the
desk
and
began
his
adventures
in
the
philosophy
alcove
he
had
heard
of
book
philosophy
but
had
not
imagined
there
had
been
so
much
written
about
it
the
high
bulging
shelves
of
heavy
tomes
humbled
him
and
at
the
same
time
stimulated
him
here
was
work
for
the
vigor
of
his
brain
he
found
books
on
trigonometry
in
the
mathematics
section
and
ran
the
pages
and
stared
at
the
meaningless
formulas
and
figures
he
could
read
english
but
he
saw
there
an
alien
speech
norman
and
arthur
knew
that
speech
he
had
heard
them
talking
it
and
they
were
her
brothers
he
left
the
alcove
in
despair
from
every
side
the
books
seemed
to
press
upon
him
and
crush
him
he
had
never
dreamed
that
the
fund
of
human
knowledge
bulked
so
big
he
was
frightened
how
could
his
brain
ever
master
it
all
later
he
remembered
that
there
were
other
men
many
men
who
had
mastered
it
and
he
breathed
a
great
oath
passionately
under
his
breath
swearing
that
his
brain
could
do
what
theirs
had
done
and
so
he
wandered
on
alternating
between
depression
and
elation
as
he
stared
at
the
shelves
packed
with
wisdom
in
one
miscellaneous
section
he
came
upon
a
he
turned
the
pages
reverently
in
a
way
it
spoke
a
kindred
speech
both
he
and
it
were
of
the
sea
then
he
found
a
and
books
by
lecky
and
marshall
there
it
was
he
would
teach
himself
navigation
he
would
quit
drinking
work
up
and
become
a
captain
ruth
seemed
very
near
to
him
in
that
moment
as
a
captain
he
could
marry
her
if
she
would
have
him
and
if
she
would
live
a
good
life
among
men
because
of
her
and
he
would
quit
drinking
anyway
then
he
remembered
the
underwriters
and
the
owners
the
two
masters
a
captain
must
serve
either
of
which
could
and
would
break
him
and
whose
interests
were
diametrically
opposed
he
cast
his
eyes
about
the
room
and
closed
the
lids
down
on
a
vision
of
ten
thousand
books
no
no
more
of
the
sea
for
him
there
was
power
in
all
that
wealth
of
books
and
if
he
would
do
great
things
he
must
do
them
on
the
land
besides
captains
were
not
allowed
to
take
their
wives
to
sea
with
them
noon
came
and
afternoon
he
forgot
to
eat
and
sought
on
for
the
books
on
etiquette
for
in
addition
to
career
his
mind
was
vexed
by
a
simple
and
very
concrete
problem
you
meet
a
young
lady
and
she
asks
you
to
call
how
soon
can
you
was
the
way
he
worded
it
to
himself
but
when
he
found
the
right
shelf
he
sought
vainly
for
the
answer
he
was
appalled
at
the
vast
edifice
of
etiquette
and
lost
himself
in
the
mazes
of
conduct
between
persons
in
polite
society
he
abandoned
his
search
he
had
not
found
what
he
wanted
though
he
had
found
that
it
would
take
all
of
a
time
to
be
polite
and
that
he
would
have
to
live
a
preliminary
life
in
which
to
learn
how
to
be
polite
you
find
what
you
wanted
the
man
at
the
desk
asked
him
as
he
was
leaving
sir
he
answered
have
a
fine
library
the
man
nodded
should
be
glad
to
see
you
here
often
are
you
a
sailor
sir
he
answered
come
now
how
did
he
know
that
he
asked
himself
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
and
for
the
first
block
along
the
street
he
walked
very
stiff
and
straight
and
awkwardly
until
he
forgot
himself
in
his
thoughts
whereupon
his
rolling
gait
gracefully
returned
to
him
chapter
vi
a
terrible
restlessness
that
was
akin
to
hunger
afflicted
martin
eden
he
was
famished
for
a
sight
of
the
girl
whose
slender
hands
had
gripped
his
life
with
a
grasp
he
could
not
steel
himself
to
call
upon
her
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
call
too
soon
and
so
be
guilty
of
an
awful
breach
of
that
awful
thing
called
etiquette
he
spent
long
hours
in
the
oakland
and
berkeley
libraries
and
made
out
application
blanks
for
membership
for
himself
his
sisters
gertrude
and
marian
and
jim
the
consent
being
obtained
at
the
expense
of
several
glasses
of
beer
with
four
cards
permitting
him
to
draw
books
he
burned
the
gas
late
in
the
room
and
was
charged
fifty
cents
a
week
for
it
by
higginbotham
the
many
books
he
read
but
served
to
whet
his
unrest
every
page
of
every
book
was
a
into
the
realm
of
knowledge
his
hunger
fed
upon
what
he
read
and
increased
also
he
did
not
know
where
to
begin
and
continually
suffered
from
lack
of
preparation
the
commonest
references
that
he
could
see
plainly
every
reader
was
expected
to
know
he
did
not
know
and
the
same
was
true
of
the
poetry
he
read
which
maddened
him
with
delight
he
read
more
of
swinburne
than
was
contained
in
the
volume
ruth
had
lent
him
and
he
understood
thoroughly
but
surely
ruth
did
not
understand
it
he
concluded
how
could
she
living
the
refined
life
she
did
then
he
chanced
upon
poems
and
was
swept
away
by
the
lilt
and
swing
and
glamour
with
which
familiar
things
had
been
invested
he
was
amazed
at
the
sympathy
with
life
and
at
his
incisive
psychology
was
a
new
word
in
vocabulary
he
had
bought
a
dictionary
which
deed
had
decreased
his
supply
of
money
and
brought
nearer
the
day
on
which
he
must
sail
in
search
of
more
also
it
incensed
higginbotham
who
would
have
preferred
the
money
taking
the
form
of
board
he
dared
not
go
near
neighborhood
in
the
daytime
but
night
found
him
lurking
like
a
thief
around
the
morse
home
stealing
glimpses
at
the
windows
and
loving
the
very
walls
that
sheltered
her
several
times
he
barely
escaped
being
caught
by
her
brothers
and
once
he
trailed
morse
down
town
and
studied
his
face
in
the
lighted
streets
longing
all
the
while
for
some
quick
danger
of
death
to
threaten
so
that
he
might
spring
in
and
save
her
father
on
another
night
his
vigil
was
rewarded
by
a
glimpse
of
ruth
through
a
window
he
saw
only
her
head
and
shoulders
and
her
arms
raised
as
she
fixed
her
hair
before
a
mirror
it
was
only
for
a
moment
but
it
was
a
long
moment
to
him
during
which
his
blood
turned
to
wine
and
sang
through
his
veins
then
she
pulled
down
the
shade
but
it
was
her
had
learned
that
and
thereafter
he
strayed
there
often
hiding
under
a
dark
tree
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
smoking
countless
cigarettes
one
afternoon
he
saw
her
mother
coming
out
of
a
bank
and
received
another
proof
of
the
enormous
distance
that
separated
ruth
from
him
she
was
of
the
class
that
dealt
with
banks
he
had
never
been
inside
a
bank
in
his
life
and
he
had
an
idea
that
such
institutions
were
frequented
only
by
the
very
rich
and
the
very
powerful
in
one
way
he
had
undergone
a
moral
revolution
her
cleanness
and
purity
had
reacted
upon
him
and
he
felt
in
his
being
a
crying
need
to
be
clean
he
must
be
that
if
he
were
ever
to
be
worthy
of
breathing
the
same
air
with
her
he
washed
his
teeth
and
scrubbed
his
hands
with
a
kitchen
till
he
saw
a
in
a
window
and
divined
its
use
while
purchasing
it
the
clerk
glanced
at
his
nails
suggested
a
and
so
he
became
possessed
of
an
additional
he
ran
across
a
book
in
the
library
on
the
care
of
the
body
and
promptly
developed
a
penchant
for
a
bath
every
morning
much
to
the
amazement
of
jim
and
to
the
bewilderment
of
higginbotham
who
was
not
in
sympathy
with
such
notions
and
who
seriously
debated
whether
or
not
he
should
charge
martin
extra
for
the
water
another
stride
was
in
the
direction
of
creased
trousers
now
that
martin
was
aroused
in
such
matters
he
swiftly
noted
the
difference
between
the
baggy
knees
of
the
trousers
worn
by
the
working
class
and
the
straight
line
from
knee
to
foot
of
those
worn
by
the
men
above
the
working
class
also
he
learned
the
reason
why
and
invaded
his
kitchen
in
search
of
irons
and
he
had
misadventures
at
first
hopelessly
burning
one
pair
and
buying
another
which
expenditure
again
brought
nearer
the
day
on
which
he
must
put
to
sea
but
the
reform
went
deeper
than
mere
outward
appearance
he
still
smoked
but
he
drank
no
more
up
to
that
time
drinking
had
seemed
to
him
the
proper
thing
for
men
to
do
and
he
had
prided
himself
on
his
strong
head
which
enabled
him
to
drink
most
men
under
the
table
whenever
he
encountered
a
chance
shipmate
and
there
were
many
in
san
francisco
he
treated
them
and
was
treated
in
turn
as
of
old
but
he
ordered
for
himself
root
beer
or
ginger
ale
and
endured
their
chaffing
and
as
they
waxed
maudlin
he
studied
them
watching
the
beast
rise
and
master
them
and
thanking
god
that
he
was
no
longer
as
they
they
had
their
limitations
to
forget
and
when
they
were
drunk
their
dim
stupid
spirits
were
even
as
gods
and
each
ruled
in
his
heaven
of
intoxicated
desire
with
martin
the
need
for
strong
drink
had
vanished
he
was
drunken
in
new
and
more
profound
ruth
who
had
fired
him
with
love
and
with
a
glimpse
of
higher
and
eternal
life
with
books
that
had
set
a
myriad
maggots
of
desire
gnawing
in
his
brain
and
with
the
sense
of
personal
cleanliness
he
was
achieving
that
gave
him
even
more
superb
health
than
what
he
had
enjoyed
and
that
made
his
whole
body
sing
with
physical
one
night
he
went
to
the
theatre
on
the
blind
chance
that
he
might
see
her
there
and
from
the
second
balcony
he
did
see
her
he
saw
her
come
down
the
aisle
with
arthur
and
a
strange
young
man
with
a
football
mop
of
hair
and
eyeglasses
the
sight
of
whom
spurred
him
to
instant
apprehension
and
jealousy
he
saw
her
take
her
seat
in
the
orchestra
circle
and
little
else
than
her
did
he
see
that
pair
of
slender
white
shoulders
and
a
mass
of
pale
gold
hair
dim
with
distance
but
there
were
others
who
saw
and
now
and
again
glancing
at
those
about
him
he
noted
two
young
girls
who
looked
back
from
the
row
in
front
a
dozen
seats
along
and
who
smiled
at
him
with
bold
eyes
he
had
always
been
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
give
rebuff
in
the
old
days
he
would
have
smiled
back
and
gone
further
and
encouraged
smiling
but
now
it
was
different
he
did
smile
back
then
looked
away
and
looked
no
more
deliberately
but
several
times
forgetting
the
existence
of
the
two
girls
his
eyes
caught
their
smiles
he
could
not
himself
in
a
day
nor
could
he
violate
the
intrinsic
kindliness
of
his
nature
so
at
such
moments
he
smiled
at
the
girls
in
warm
human
friendliness
it
was
nothing
new
to
him
he
knew
they
were
reaching
out
their
hands
to
him
but
it
was
different
now
far
down
there
in
the
orchestra
circle
was
the
one
woman
in
all
the
world
so
different
so
terrifically
different
from
these
two
girls
of
his
class
that
he
could
feel
for
them
only
pity
and
sorrow
he
had
it
in
his
heart
to
wish
that
they
could
possess
in
some
small
measure
her
goodness
and
glory
and
not
for
the
world
could
he
hurt
them
because
of
their
outreaching
he
was
not
flattered
by
it
he
even
felt
a
slight
shame
at
his
lowliness
that
permitted
it
he
knew
did
he
belong
in
class
that
there
would
be
no
overtures
from
these
girls
and
with
each
glance
of
theirs
he
felt
the
fingers
of
his
own
class
clutching
at
him
to
hold
him
down
he
left
his
seat
before
the
curtain
went
down
on
the
last
act
intent
on
seeing
her
as
she
passed
out
there
were
always
numbers
of
men
who
stood
on
the
sidewalk
outside
and
he
could
pull
his
cap
down
over
his
eyes
and
screen
himself
behind
some
shoulder
so
that
she
should
not
see
him
he
emerged
from
the
theatre
with
the
first
of
the
crowd
but
scarcely
had
he
taken
his
position
on
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
when
the
two
girls
appeared
they
were
looking
for
him
he
knew
and
for
the
moment
he
could
have
cursed
that
in
him
which
drew
women
their
casual
edging
across
the
sidewalk
to
the
curb
as
they
drew
near
apprised
him
of
discovery
they
slowed
down
and
were
in
the
thick
of
the
crowd
as
they
came
up
with
him
one
of
them
brushed
against
him
and
apparently
for
the
first
time
noticed
him
she
was
a
slender
dark
girl
with
black
defiant
eyes
but
they
smiled
at
him
and
he
smiled
back
he
said
it
was
automatic
he
had
said
it
so
often
before
under
similar
circumstances
of
first
meetings
besides
he
could
do
no
less
there
was
that
large
tolerance
and
sympathy
in
his
nature
that
would
permit
him
to
do
no
less
the
girl
smiled
gratification
and
greeting
and
showed
signs
of
stopping
while
her
companion
arm
linked
in
arm
giggled
and
likewise
showed
signs
of
halting
he
thought
quickly
it
would
never
do
for
her
to
come
out
and
see
him
talking
there
with
them
quite
naturally
as
a
matter
of
course
he
swung
in
the
one
and
walked
with
her
there
was
no
awkwardness
on
his
part
no
numb
tongue
he
was
at
home
here
and
he
held
his
own
royally
in
the
badinage
bristling
with
slang
and
sharpness
that
was
always
the
preliminary
to
getting
acquainted
in
these
affairs
at
the
corner
where
the
main
stream
of
people
flowed
onward
he
started
to
edge
out
into
the
cross
street
but
the
girl
with
the
black
eyes
caught
his
arm
following
him
and
dragging
her
companion
after
her
as
she
cried
on
bill
yer
rush
not
to
shake
us
so
sudden
as
all
that
he
halted
with
a
laugh
and
turned
facing
them
across
their
shoulders
he
could
see
the
moving
throng
passing
under
the
street
lamps
where
he
stood
it
was
not
so
light
and
unseen
he
would
be
able
to
see
her
as
she
passed
by
she
would
certainly
pass
by
for
that
way
led
home
her
name
he
asked
of
the
giggling
girl
nodding
at
the
one
ask
her
was
the
convulsed
response
what
is
it
he
demanded
turning
squarely
on
the
girl
in
question
told
me
yours
yet
she
retorted
never
asked
it
he
smiled
you
guessed
the
first
rattle
bill
all
right
all
go
with
she
looked
him
in
the
eyes
her
own
sharply
passionate
and
inviting
is
it
honest
again
she
looked
all
the
centuries
of
woman
since
sex
began
were
eloquent
in
her
eyes
and
he
measured
her
in
a
careless
way
and
knew
bold
now
that
she
would
begin
to
retreat
coyly
and
delicately
as
he
pursued
ever
ready
to
reverse
the
game
should
he
turn
fainthearted
and
too
he
was
human
and
could
feel
the
draw
of
her
while
his
ego
could
not
but
appreciate
the
flattery
of
her
kindness
oh
he
knew
it
all
and
knew
them
well
from
a
to
z
good
as
goodness
might
be
measured
in
their
particular
class
for
meagre
wages
and
scorning
the
sale
of
self
for
easier
ways
nervously
desirous
for
some
small
pinch
of
happiness
in
the
desert
of
existence
and
facing
a
future
that
was
a
gamble
between
the
ugliness
of
unending
toil
and
the
black
pit
of
more
terrible
wretchedness
the
way
whereto
being
briefer
though
better
paid
he
answered
nodding
his
head
pete
bill
no
she
queried
bill
at
all
the
other
broke
in
do
you
know
he
demanded
never
laid
eyes
on
me
need
to
to
know
was
the
retort
bill
what
is
it
the
first
girl
asked
do
he
confessed
she
reached
out
to
his
arm
and
shook
him
playfully
knew
you
was
but
you
look
good
to
me
just
the
he
captured
the
hand
that
invited
and
felt
on
the
palm
familiar
markings
and
distortions
you
chuck
the
cannery
he
asked
yeh
know
and
cheh
a
the
girls
chorussed
and
while
he
exchanged
the
stupidities
of
stupid
minds
with
them
before
his
inner
sight
towered
the
of
the
library
filled
with
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
he
smiled
bitterly
at
the
incongruity
of
it
and
was
assailed
by
doubts
but
between
inner
vision
and
outward
pleasantry
he
found
time
to
watch
the
theatre
crowd
streaming
by
and
then
he
saw
her
under
the
lights
between
her
brother
and
the
strange
young
man
with
glasses
and
his
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
he
had
waited
long
for
this
moment
he
had
time
to
note
the
light
fluffy
something
that
hid
her
queenly
head
the
tasteful
lines
of
her
wrapped
figure
the
gracefulness
of
her
carriage
and
of
the
hand
that
caught
up
her
skirts
and
then
she
was
gone
and
he
was
left
staring
at
the
two
girls
of
the
cannery
at
their
tawdry
attempts
at
prettiness
of
dress
their
tragic
efforts
to
be
clean
and
trim
the
cheap
cloth
the
cheap
ribbons
and
the
cheap
rings
on
the
fingers
he
felt
a
tug
at
his
arm
and
heard
a
voice
saying
up
bill
the
matter
with
you
was
you
he
asked
the
dark
girl
answered
with
a
toss
of
her
head
was
only
i
was
be
a
good
idea
if
you
could
dig
up
a
gentleman
indicating
her
companion
then
we
could
go
off
have
soda
somewhere
or
coffee
or
he
was
afflicted
by
a
sudden
spiritual
nausea
the
transition
from
ruth
to
this
had
been
too
abrupt
ranged
side
by
side
with
the
bold
defiant
eyes
of
the
girl
before
him
he
saw
clear
luminous
eyes
like
a
gazing
at
him
out
of
unplumbed
depths
of
purity
and
somehow
he
felt
within
him
a
stir
of
power
he
was
better
than
this
life
meant
more
to
him
than
it
meant
to
these
two
girls
whose
thoughts
did
not
go
beyond
and
a
gentleman
friend
he
remembered
that
he
had
led
always
a
secret
life
in
his
thoughts
these
thoughts
he
had
tried
to
share
but
never
had
he
found
a
woman
capable
of
a
man
he
had
tried
at
times
but
had
only
puzzled
his
listeners
and
as
his
thoughts
had
been
beyond
them
so
he
argued
now
he
must
be
beyond
them
he
felt
power
move
in
him
and
clenched
his
fists
if
life
meant
more
to
him
then
it
was
for
him
to
demand
more
from
life
but
he
could
not
demand
it
from
such
companionship
as
this
those
bold
black
eyes
had
nothing
to
offer
he
knew
the
thoughts
behind
and
of
something
else
but
those
eyes
offered
all
he
knew
and
more
than
he
could
guess
they
offered
books
and
painting
beauty
and
repose
and
all
the
fine
elegance
of
higher
existence
behind
those
black
eyes
he
knew
every
thought
process
it
was
like
clockwork
he
could
watch
every
wheel
go
around
their
bid
was
low
pleasure
narrow
as
the
grave
that
palled
and
the
grave
was
at
the
end
of
it
but
the
bid
of
the
eyes
was
mystery
and
wonder
unthinkable
and
eternal
life
he
had
caught
glimpses
of
the
soul
in
them
and
glimpses
of
his
own
soul
too
only
one
thing
wrong
with
the
programme
he
said
aloud
got
a
date
the
eyes
blazed
her
disappointment
sit
up
with
a
sick
friend
i
suppose
she
sneered
a
real
honest
date
he
faltered
a
not
me
she
asked
earnestly
he
looked
her
in
the
eyes
and
answered
straight
all
right
but
why
we
meet
some
other
time
you
told
me
your
name
yet
where
live
she
replied
softening
toward
him
her
hand
pressing
his
arm
while
her
body
leaned
against
his
connolly
and
i
live
at
fifth
he
talked
on
a
few
minutes
before
saying
good
night
he
did
not
go
home
immediately
and
under
the
tree
where
he
kept
his
vigils
he
looked
up
at
a
window
and
murmured
date
was
with
you
ruth
i
kept
it
for
chapter
vii
a
week
of
heavy
reading
had
passed
since
the
evening
he
first
met
ruth
morse
and
still
he
dared
not
call
time
and
again
he
nerved
himself
up
to
call
but
under
the
doubts
that
assailed
him
his
determination
died
away
he
did
not
know
the
proper
time
to
call
nor
was
there
any
one
to
tell
him
and
he
was
afraid
of
committing
himself
to
an
irretrievable
blunder
having
shaken
himself
free
from
his
old
companions
and
old
ways
of
life
and
having
no
new
companions
nothing
remained
for
him
but
to
read
and
the
long
hours
he
devoted
to
it
would
have
ruined
a
dozen
pairs
of
ordinary
eyes
but
his
eyes
were
strong
and
they
were
backed
by
a
body
superbly
strong
furthermore
his
mind
was
fallow
it
had
lain
fallow
all
his
life
so
far
as
the
abstract
thought
of
the
books
was
concerned
and
it
was
ripe
for
the
sowing
it
had
never
been
jaded
by
study
and
it
bit
hold
of
the
knowledge
in
the
books
with
sharp
teeth
that
would
not
let
go
it
seemed
to
him
by
the
end
of
the
week
that
he
had
lived
centuries
so
far
behind
were
the
old
life
and
outlook
but
he
was
baffled
by
lack
of
preparation
he
attempted
to
read
books
that
required
years
of
preliminary
specialization
one
day
he
would
read
a
book
of
antiquated
philosophy
and
the
next
day
one
that
was
so
that
his
head
would
be
whirling
with
the
conflict
and
contradiction
of
ideas
it
was
the
same
with
the
economists
on
the
one
shelf
at
the
library
he
found
karl
marx
ricardo
adam
smith
and
mill
and
the
abstruse
formulas
of
the
one
gave
no
clew
that
the
ideas
of
another
were
obsolete
he
was
bewildered
and
yet
he
wanted
to
know
he
had
become
interested
in
a
day
in
economics
industry
and
politics
passing
through
the
city
hall
park
he
had
noticed
a
group
of
men
in
the
centre
of
which
were
half
a
dozen
with
flushed
faces
and
raised
voices
earnestly
carrying
on
a
discussion
he
joined
the
listeners
and
heard
a
new
alien
tongue
in
the
mouths
of
the
philosophers
of
the
people
one
was
a
tramp
another
was
a
labor
agitator
a
third
was
a
student
and
the
remainder
was
composed
of
wordy
workingmen
for
the
first
time
he
heard
of
socialism
anarchism
and
single
tax
and
learned
that
there
were
warring
social
philosophies
he
heard
hundreds
of
technical
words
that
were
new
to
him
belonging
to
fields
of
thought
that
his
meagre
reading
had
never
touched
upon
because
of
this
he
could
not
follow
the
arguments
closely
and
he
could
only
guess
at
and
surmise
the
ideas
wrapped
up
in
such
strange
expressions
then
there
was
a
restaurant
waiter
who
was
a
theosophist
a
union
baker
who
was
an
agnostic
an
old
man
who
baffled
all
of
them
with
the
strange
philosophy
that
is
is
and
another
old
man
who
discoursed
interminably
about
the
cosmos
and
the
and
the
martin
head
was
in
a
state
of
addlement
when
he
went
away
after
several
hours
and
he
hurried
to
the
library
to
look
up
the
definitions
of
a
dozen
unusual
words
and
when
he
left
the
library
he
carried
under
his
arm
four
volumes
madam
doctrine
and
poverty
quintessence
of
socialism
and
of
religion
and
unfortunately
he
began
on
the
every
line
bristled
with
words
he
did
not
understand
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
the
dictionary
was
in
front
of
him
more
often
than
the
book
he
looked
up
so
many
new
words
that
when
they
recurred
he
had
forgotten
their
meaning
and
had
to
look
them
up
again
he
devised
the
plan
of
writing
the
definitions
in
a
and
filled
page
after
page
with
them
and
still
he
could
not
understand
he
read
until
three
in
the
morning
and
his
brain
was
in
a
turmoil
but
not
one
essential
thought
in
the
text
had
he
grasped
he
looked
up
and
it
seemed
that
the
room
was
lifting
heeling
and
plunging
like
a
ship
upon
the
sea
then
he
hurled
the
and
many
curses
across
the
room
turned
off
the
gas
and
composed
himself
to
sleep
nor
did
he
have
much
better
luck
with
the
other
three
books
it
was
not
that
his
brain
was
weak
or
incapable
it
could
think
these
thoughts
were
it
not
for
lack
of
training
in
thinking
and
lack
of
the
with
which
to
think
he
guessed
this
and
for
a
while
entertained
the
idea
of
reading
nothing
but
the
dictionary
until
he
had
mastered
every
word
in
it
poetry
however
was
his
solace
and
he
read
much
of
it
finding
his
greatest
joy
in
the
simpler
poets
who
were
more
understandable
he
loved
beauty
and
there
he
found
beauty
poetry
like
music
stirred
him
profoundly
and
though
he
did
not
know
it
he
was
preparing
his
mind
for
the
heavier
work
that
was
to
come
the
pages
of
his
mind
were
blank
and
without
effort
much
he
read
and
liked
stanza
by
stanza
was
impressed
upon
those
pages
so
that
he
was
soon
able
to
extract
great
joy
from
chanting
aloud
or
under
his
breath
the
music
and
the
beauty
of
the
printed
words
he
had
read
then
he
stumbled
upon
and
of
fable
side
by
side
on
a
library
shelf
it
was
illumination
a
great
light
in
the
darkness
of
his
ignorance
and
he
read
poetry
more
avidly
than
ever
the
man
at
the
desk
in
the
library
had
seen
martin
there
so
often
that
he
had
become
quite
cordial
always
greeting
him
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
when
he
entered
it
was
because
of
this
that
martin
did
a
daring
thing
drawing
out
some
books
at
the
desk
and
while
the
man
was
stamping
the
cards
martin
blurted
out
something
like
to
ask
the
man
smiled
and
paid
attention
you
meet
a
young
lady
she
asks
you
to
call
how
soon
can
you
call
martin
felt
his
shirt
press
and
cling
to
his
shoulders
what
of
the
sweat
of
the
effort
say
any
time
the
man
answered
but
this
is
different
martin
objected
you
see
this
way
maybe
she
be
there
she
goes
to
the
call
i
said
what
i
meant
martin
confessed
falteringly
while
he
made
up
his
mind
to
throw
himself
wholly
upon
the
mercy
just
a
rough
sort
of
a
fellow
i
never
seen
anything
of
society
this
girl
is
all
that
i
i
anything
that
she
is
you
think
the
fool
do
you
he
demanded
abruptly
no
not
at
all
i
assure
you
the
other
protested
request
is
not
exactly
in
the
scope
of
the
reference
department
but
i
shall
be
only
too
pleased
to
assist
martin
looked
at
him
admiringly
i
could
tear
it
off
that
way
be
all
right
he
said
beg
pardon
mean
if
i
could
talk
easy
that
way
polite
all
the
said
the
other
with
comprehension
is
the
best
time
to
call
the
afternoon
too
close
to
or
the
evening
or
sunday
tell
you
the
librarian
said
with
a
brightening
face
call
her
up
on
the
telephone
and
find
do
it
he
said
picking
up
his
books
and
starting
away
he
turned
back
and
asked
to
a
young
for
instance
miss
lizzie
you
say
or
smith
the
librarian
stated
authoritatively
you
come
to
know
her
so
it
was
that
martin
eden
solved
the
problem
down
any
time
be
at
home
all
afternoon
was
reply
over
the
telephone
to
his
stammered
request
as
to
when
he
could
return
the
borrowed
books
she
met
him
at
the
door
herself
and
her
eyes
took
in
immediately
the
creased
trousers
and
the
certain
slight
but
indefinable
change
in
him
for
the
better
also
she
was
struck
by
his
face
it
was
almost
violent
this
health
of
his
and
it
seemed
to
rush
out
of
him
and
at
her
in
waves
of
force
she
felt
the
urge
again
of
the
desire
to
lean
toward
him
for
warmth
and
marvelled
again
at
the
effect
his
presence
produced
upon
her
and
he
in
turn
knew
again
the
swimming
sensation
of
bliss
when
he
felt
the
contact
of
her
hand
in
greeting
the
difference
between
them
lay
in
that
she
was
cool
and
while
his
face
flushed
to
the
roots
of
the
hair
he
stumbled
with
his
old
awkwardness
after
her
and
his
shoulders
swung
and
lurched
perilously
once
they
were
seated
in
the
he
began
to
get
on
easily
by
far
than
he
had
expected
she
made
it
easy
for
him
and
the
gracious
spirit
with
which
she
did
it
made
him
love
her
more
madly
than
ever
they
talked
first
of
the
borrowed
books
of
the
swinburne
he
was
devoted
to
and
of
the
browning
he
did
not
understand
and
she
led
the
conversation
on
from
subject
to
subject
while
she
pondered
the
problem
of
how
she
could
be
of
help
to
him
she
had
thought
of
this
often
since
their
first
meeting
she
wanted
to
help
him
he
made
a
call
upon
her
pity
and
tenderness
that
no
one
had
ever
made
before
and
the
pity
was
not
so
much
derogatory
of
him
as
maternal
in
her
her
pity
could
not
be
of
the
common
sort
when
the
man
who
drew
it
was
so
much
man
as
to
shock
her
with
maidenly
fears
and
set
her
mind
and
pulse
thrilling
with
strange
thoughts
and
feelings
the
old
fascination
of
his
neck
was
there
and
there
was
sweetness
in
the
thought
of
laying
her
hands
upon
it
it
seemed
still
a
wanton
impulse
but
she
had
grown
more
used
to
it
she
did
not
dream
that
in
such
guise
love
would
epitomize
itself
nor
did
she
dream
that
the
feeling
he
excited
in
her
was
love
she
thought
she
was
merely
interested
in
him
as
an
unusual
type
possessing
various
potential
excellencies
and
she
even
felt
philanthropic
about
it
she
did
not
know
she
desired
him
but
with
him
it
was
different
he
knew
that
he
loved
her
and
he
desired
her
as
he
had
never
before
desired
anything
in
his
life
he
had
loved
poetry
for
sake
but
since
he
met
her
the
gates
to
the
vast
field
of
had
been
opened
wide
she
had
given
him
understanding
even
more
than
bulfinch
and
gayley
there
was
a
line
that
a
week
before
he
would
not
have
favored
with
a
second
own
mad
lover
dying
on
a
but
now
it
was
ever
insistent
in
his
mind
he
marvelled
at
the
wonder
of
it
and
the
truth
and
as
he
gazed
upon
her
he
knew
that
he
could
die
gladly
upon
a
kiss
he
felt
himself
own
mad
lover
and
no
accolade
of
knighthood
could
have
given
him
greater
pride
and
at
last
he
knew
the
meaning
of
life
and
why
he
had
been
born
as
he
gazed
at
her
and
listened
his
thoughts
grew
daring
he
reviewed
all
the
wild
delight
of
the
pressure
of
her
hand
in
his
at
the
door
and
longed
for
it
again
his
gaze
wandered
often
toward
her
lips
and
he
yearned
for
them
hungrily
but
there
was
nothing
gross
or
earthly
about
this
yearning
it
gave
him
exquisite
delight
to
watch
every
movement
and
play
of
those
lips
as
they
enunciated
the
words
she
spoke
yet
they
were
not
ordinary
lips
such
as
all
men
and
women
had
their
substance
was
not
mere
human
clay
they
were
lips
of
pure
spirit
and
his
desire
for
them
seemed
absolutely
different
from
the
desire
that
had
led
him
to
other
lips
he
could
kiss
her
lips
rest
his
own
physical
lips
upon
them
but
it
would
be
with
the
lofty
and
awful
fervor
with
which
one
would
kiss
the
robe
of
god
he
was
not
conscious
of
this
transvaluation
of
values
that
had
taken
place
in
him
and
was
unaware
that
the
light
that
shone
in
his
eyes
when
he
looked
at
her
was
quite
the
same
light
that
shines
in
all
eyes
when
the
desire
of
love
is
upon
them
he
did
not
dream
how
ardent
and
masculine
his
gaze
was
nor
that
the
warm
flame
of
it
was
affecting
the
alchemy
of
her
spirit
her
penetrative
virginity
exalted
and
disguised
his
own
emotions
elevating
his
thoughts
to
a
chastity
and
he
would
have
been
startled
to
learn
that
there
was
that
shining
out
of
his
eyes
like
warm
waves
that
flowed
through
her
and
kindled
a
kindred
warmth
she
was
subtly
perturbed
by
it
and
more
than
once
though
she
knew
not
why
it
disrupted
her
train
of
thought
with
its
delicious
intrusion
and
compelled
her
to
grope
for
the
remainder
of
ideas
partly
uttered
speech
was
always
easy
with
her
and
these
interruptions
would
have
puzzled
her
had
she
not
decided
that
it
was
because
he
was
a
remarkable
type
she
was
very
sensitive
to
impressions
and
it
was
not
strange
after
all
that
this
aura
of
a
traveller
from
another
world
should
so
affect
her
the
problem
in
the
background
of
her
consciousness
was
how
to
help
him
and
she
turned
the
conversation
in
that
direction
but
it
was
martin
who
came
to
the
point
first
wonder
if
i
can
get
some
advice
from
you
he
began
and
received
an
acquiescence
of
willingness
that
made
his
heart
bound
remember
the
other
time
i
was
here
i
said
i
talk
about
books
things
because
i
know
how
well
ben
a
lot
of
ever
since
ben
to
the
library
a
whole
lot
but
most
of
the
books
tackled
have
ben
over
my
head
mebbe
better
begin
at
the
i
never
had
no
advantages
worked
pretty
hard
ever
since
i
was
a
kid
since
ben
to
the
library
with
new
eyes
at
at
new
books
just
about
concluded
that
i
ben
reading
the
right
kind
you
know
the
books
you
find
in
the
same
got
in
this
house
for
instance
well
the
sort
of
matter
ben
accustomed
to
and
i
just
a
brag
of
ben
different
from
the
people
herded
with
not
that
any
better
than
the
sailors
i
travelled
with
was
for
a
short
time
you
know
i
always
liked
books
read
everything
i
could
lay
hands
on
i
guess
i
think
differently
from
most
of
to
come
to
what
at
i
was
never
inside
a
house
like
this
when
i
come
a
week
ago
saw
all
this
you
your
mother
brothers
i
liked
it
heard
about
such
things
read
about
such
things
in
some
of
the
books
when
i
looked
around
at
your
house
why
the
books
come
true
but
the
thing
after
is
i
liked
it
i
wanted
it
i
want
it
now
i
want
to
breathe
air
like
you
get
in
this
that
is
filled
with
books
and
pictures
and
beautiful
things
where
people
talk
in
low
voices
are
clean
their
thoughts
are
clean
the
air
i
always
breathed
was
mixed
up
with
grub
an
booze
all
they
talked
about
too
why
when
you
was
the
room
to
kiss
your
mother
i
thought
it
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
i
ever
seen
seen
a
whole
lot
of
life
somehow
seen
a
whole
lot
more
of
it
than
most
of
them
that
was
with
me
i
like
to
see
i
want
to
see
more
i
want
to
see
it
different
i
got
to
the
point
yet
here
it
is
i
want
to
make
my
way
to
the
kind
of
life
you
have
in
this
house
more
in
life
than
booze
hard
work
about
now
how
am
i
to
get
it
where
do
i
take
hold
begin
to
work
my
passage
you
know
i
can
make
most
men
sick
when
it
comes
to
hard
work
once
i
get
started
work
night
day
mebbe
you
think
funny
me
you
about
all
this
i
know
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
ought
to
ask
but
i
know
anybody
else
i
could
arthur
mebbe
i
ought
to
ask
him
if
i
his
voice
died
away
his
firmly
planned
intention
had
come
to
a
halt
on
the
verge
of
the
horrible
probability
that
he
should
have
asked
arthur
and
that
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
ruth
did
not
speak
immediately
she
was
too
absorbed
in
striving
to
reconcile
the
stumbling
uncouth
speech
and
its
simplicity
of
thought
with
what
she
saw
in
his
face
she
had
never
looked
in
eyes
that
expressed
greater
power
here
was
a
man
who
could
do
anything
was
the
message
she
read
there
and
it
accorded
ill
with
the
weakness
of
his
spoken
thought
and
for
that
matter
so
complex
and
quick
was
her
own
mind
that
she
did
not
have
a
just
appreciation
of
simplicity
and
yet
she
had
caught
an
impression
of
power
in
the
very
groping
of
this
mind
it
had
seemed
to
her
like
a
giant
writhing
and
straining
at
the
bonds
that
held
him
down
her
face
was
all
sympathy
when
she
did
speak
you
need
you
realize
yourself
and
it
is
education
you
should
go
back
and
finish
grammar
school
and
then
go
through
to
high
school
and
that
takes
money
he
interrupted
she
cried
had
not
thought
of
that
but
then
you
have
relatives
somebody
who
could
assist
you
he
shook
his
head
father
and
mother
are
dead
two
sisters
one
married
the
get
married
soon
i
suppose
then
a
string
of
brothers
the
youngest
they
never
helped
nobody
just
knocked
around
over
the
world
out
for
number
one
the
oldest
died
in
india
two
are
in
south
africa
now
on
a
whaling
voyage
with
a
does
trapeze
work
i
guess
just
like
them
taken
care
of
myself
since
i
was
when
my
mother
died
got
to
study
by
myself
i
guess
what
i
want
to
know
is
where
to
should
say
the
first
thing
of
all
would
be
to
get
a
grammar
your
grammar
she
had
intended
saying
but
she
amended
it
to
not
particularly
he
flushed
and
sweated
know
i
must
talk
a
lot
of
slang
words
you
understand
but
then
the
only
words
i
to
speak
got
other
words
in
my
mind
picked
up
from
books
but
i
pronounce
so
i
use
what
you
say
so
much
as
how
you
say
it
you
mind
my
being
frank
do
you
i
want
to
hurt
no
he
cried
while
he
secretly
blessed
her
for
her
kindness
away
got
to
know
sooner
know
from
you
than
anybody
then
you
say
it
should
be
you
say
for
you
use
the
double
the
double
negative
he
demanded
then
added
humbly
see
i
even
understand
your
afraid
i
explain
that
she
smiled
double
negative
me
you
say
helped
is
a
negative
is
another
negative
it
is
a
rule
that
two
negatives
make
a
positive
helped
means
that
not
helping
nobody
they
must
have
helped
pretty
clear
he
said
never
thought
of
it
before
but
it
mean
they
have
helped
somebody
does
it
seems
to
me
that
helped
just
naturally
fails
to
say
whether
or
not
they
helped
somebody
i
never
thought
of
it
before
and
never
say
it
she
was
pleased
and
surprised
with
the
quickness
and
surety
of
his
mind
as
soon
as
he
had
got
the
clew
he
not
only
understood
but
corrected
her
error
find
it
all
in
the
grammar
she
went
on
something
else
i
noticed
in
your
speech
you
say
when
you
is
a
contraction
and
stands
for
two
words
do
you
know
them
he
thought
a
moment
then
answered
she
nodded
her
head
and
said
you
use
when
you
mean
he
was
puzzled
over
this
and
did
not
get
it
so
quickly
me
an
illustration
he
asked
she
puckered
her
brows
and
pursed
up
her
mouth
as
she
thought
while
he
looked
on
and
decided
that
her
expression
was
most
adorable
do
to
be
change
to
not
and
it
reads
do
not
do
to
be
hasty
which
is
perfectly
he
turned
it
over
in
his
mind
and
considered
it
jar
on
your
ear
she
suggested
say
that
it
does
he
replied
judicially
you
say
say
that
it
she
queried
sounds
wrong
he
said
slowly
for
the
other
i
make
up
my
mind
i
guess
my
ear
had
the
yours
is
no
such
word
as
she
said
prettily
emphatic
martin
flushed
again
you
say
for
she
continued
for
and
the
way
you
chop
your
endings
is
something
do
you
mean
he
leaned
forward
feeling
that
he
ought
to
get
down
on
his
knees
before
so
marvellous
a
mind
do
i
chop
complete
the
endings
spells
you
pronounce
it
spells
sometimes
you
pronounce
it
and
sometimes
you
leave
off
the
and
then
you
slur
by
dropping
initial
letters
and
diphthongs
spells
you
pronounce
well
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
over
all
of
them
what
you
need
is
the
grammar
get
one
and
show
you
how
to
as
she
arose
there
shot
through
his
mind
something
that
he
had
read
in
the
etiquette
books
and
he
stood
up
awkwardly
worrying
as
to
whether
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
and
fearing
that
she
might
take
it
as
a
sign
that
he
was
about
to
go
the
way
eden
she
called
back
as
she
was
leaving
the
room
is
you
used
it
several
times
you
booze
he
laughed
slang
it
means
whiskey
that
will
make
you
another
thing
she
laughed
back
use
when
you
are
impersonal
is
very
personal
and
your
use
of
it
just
now
was
not
precisely
what
you
just
see
you
said
just
now
to
me
and
that
will
make
you
me
drunk
you
see
it
would
it
of
course
she
smiled
it
would
be
nicer
not
to
bring
me
into
it
substitute
for
and
see
how
much
better
it
when
she
returned
with
the
grammar
she
drew
a
chair
near
wondered
if
he
should
have
helped
her
with
the
sat
down
beside
him
she
turned
the
pages
of
the
grammar
and
their
heads
were
inclined
toward
each
other
he
could
hardly
follow
her
outlining
of
the
work
he
must
do
so
amazed
was
he
by
her
delightful
propinquity
but
when
she
began
to
lay
down
the
importance
of
conjugation
he
forgot
all
about
her
he
had
never
heard
of
conjugation
and
was
fascinated
by
the
glimpse
he
was
catching
into
the
of
language
he
leaned
closer
to
the
page
and
her
hair
touched
his
cheek
he
had
fainted
but
once
in
his
life
and
he
thought
he
was
going
to
faint
again
he
could
scarcely
breathe
and
his
heart
was
pounding
the
blood
up
into
his
throat
and
suffocating
him
never
had
she
seemed
so
accessible
as
now
for
the
moment
the
great
gulf
that
separated
them
was
bridged
but
there
was
no
diminution
in
the
loftiness
of
his
feeling
for
her
she
had
not
descended
to
him
it
was
he
who
had
been
caught
up
into
the
clouds
and
carried
to
her
his
reverence
for
her
in
that
moment
was
of
the
same
order
as
religious
awe
and
fervor
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
intruded
upon
the
holy
of
holies
and
slowly
and
carefully
he
moved
his
head
aside
from
the
contact
which
thrilled
him
like
an
electric
shock
and
of
which
she
had
not
been
aware
chapter
viii
several
weeks
went
by
during
which
martin
eden
studied
his
grammar
reviewed
the
books
on
etiquette
and
read
voraciously
the
books
that
caught
his
fancy
of
his
own
class
he
saw
nothing
the
girls
of
the
lotus
club
wondered
what
had
become
of
him
and
worried
jim
with
questions
and
some
of
the
fellows
who
put
on
the
glove
at
were
glad
that
martin
came
no
more
he
made
another
discovery
of
in
the
library
as
the
grammar
had
shown
him
the
of
language
so
that
book
showed
him
the
of
poetry
and
he
began
to
learn
metre
and
construction
and
form
beneath
the
beauty
he
loved
finding
the
why
and
wherefore
of
that
beauty
another
modern
book
he
found
treated
poetry
as
a
representative
art
treated
it
exhaustively
with
copious
illustrations
from
the
best
in
literature
never
had
he
read
fiction
with
so
keen
zest
as
he
studied
these
books
and
his
fresh
mind
untaxed
for
twenty
years
and
impelled
by
maturity
of
desire
gripped
hold
of
what
he
read
with
a
virility
unusual
to
the
student
mind
when
he
looked
back
now
from
his
the
old
world
he
had
known
the
world
of
land
and
sea
and
ships
of
and
seemed
a
very
small
world
and
yet
it
blended
in
with
this
new
world
and
expanded
his
mind
made
for
unity
and
he
was
surprised
when
at
first
he
began
to
see
points
of
contact
between
the
two
worlds
and
he
was
ennobled
as
well
by
the
loftiness
of
thought
and
beauty
he
found
in
the
books
this
led
him
to
believe
more
firmly
than
ever
that
up
above
him
in
society
like
ruth
and
her
family
all
men
and
women
thought
these
thoughts
and
lived
them
down
below
where
he
lived
was
the
ignoble
and
he
wanted
to
purge
himself
of
the
ignoble
that
had
soiled
all
his
days
and
to
rise
to
that
sublimated
realm
where
dwelt
the
upper
classes
all
his
childhood
and
youth
had
been
troubled
by
a
vague
unrest
he
had
never
known
what
he
wanted
but
he
had
wanted
something
that
he
had
hunted
vainly
for
until
he
met
ruth
and
now
his
unrest
had
become
sharp
and
painful
and
he
knew
at
last
clearly
and
definitely
that
it
was
beauty
and
intellect
and
love
that
he
must
have
during
those
several
weeks
he
saw
ruth
half
a
dozen
times
and
each
time
was
an
added
inspiration
she
helped
him
with
his
english
corrected
his
pronunciation
and
started
him
on
arithmetic
but
their
intercourse
was
not
all
devoted
to
elementary
study
he
had
seen
too
much
of
life
and
his
mind
was
too
matured
to
be
wholly
content
with
fractions
cube
root
parsing
and
analysis
and
there
were
times
when
their
conversation
turned
on
other
last
poetry
he
had
read
the
latest
poet
she
had
studied
and
when
she
read
aloud
to
him
her
favorite
passages
he
ascended
to
the
topmost
heaven
of
delight
never
in
all
the
women
he
had
heard
speak
had
he
heard
a
voice
like
hers
the
least
sound
of
it
was
a
stimulus
to
his
love
and
he
thrilled
and
throbbed
with
every
word
she
uttered
it
was
the
quality
of
it
the
repose
and
the
musical
soft
rich
indefinable
product
of
culture
and
a
gentle
soul
as
he
listened
to
her
there
rang
in
the
ears
of
his
memory
the
harsh
cries
of
barbarian
women
and
of
hags
and
in
lesser
degrees
of
harshness
the
strident
voices
of
working
women
and
of
the
girls
of
his
own
class
then
the
chemistry
of
vision
would
begin
to
work
and
they
would
troop
in
review
across
his
mind
each
by
contrast
multiplying
glories
then
too
his
bliss
was
heightened
by
the
knowledge
that
her
mind
was
comprehending
what
she
read
and
was
quivering
with
appreciation
of
the
beauty
of
the
written
thought
she
read
to
him
much
from
princess
and
often
he
saw
her
eyes
swimming
with
tears
so
finely
was
her
aesthetic
nature
strung
at
such
moments
her
own
emotions
elevated
him
till
he
was
as
a
god
and
as
he
gazed
at
her
and
listened
he
seemed
gazing
on
the
face
of
life
and
reading
its
deepest
secrets
and
then
becoming
aware
of
the
heights
of
exquisite
sensibility
he
attained
he
decided
that
this
was
love
and
that
love
was
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
and
in
review
would
pass
along
the
corridors
of
memory
all
previous
thrills
and
burnings
he
had
known
drunkenness
of
wine
the
caresses
of
women
the
rough
play
and
give
and
take
of
physical
contests
they
seemed
trivial
and
mean
compared
with
this
sublime
ardor
he
now
enjoyed
the
situation
was
obscured
to
ruth
she
had
never
had
any
experiences
of
the
heart
her
only
experiences
in
such
matters
were
of
the
books
where
the
facts
of
ordinary
day
were
translated
by
fancy
into
a
fairy
realm
of
unreality
and
she
little
knew
that
this
rough
sailor
was
creeping
into
her
heart
and
storing
there
pent
forces
that
would
some
day
burst
forth
and
surge
through
her
in
waves
of
fire
she
did
not
know
the
actual
fire
of
love
her
knowledge
of
love
was
purely
theoretical
and
she
conceived
of
it
as
lambent
flame
gentle
as
the
fall
of
dew
or
the
ripple
of
quiet
water
and
cool
as
the
of
summer
nights
her
idea
of
love
was
more
that
of
placid
affection
serving
the
loved
one
softly
in
an
atmosphere
and
of
ethereal
calm
she
did
not
dream
of
the
volcanic
convulsions
of
love
its
scorching
heat
and
sterile
wastes
of
parched
ashes
she
knew
neither
her
own
potencies
nor
the
potencies
of
the
world
and
the
deeps
of
life
were
to
her
seas
of
illusion
the
conjugal
affection
of
her
father
and
mother
constituted
her
ideal
of
and
she
looked
forward
some
day
to
emerging
without
shock
or
friction
into
that
same
quiet
sweetness
of
existence
with
a
loved
one
so
it
was
that
she
looked
upon
martin
eden
as
a
novelty
a
strange
individual
and
she
identified
with
novelty
and
strangeness
the
effects
he
produced
upon
her
it
was
only
natural
in
similar
ways
she
had
experienced
unusual
feelings
when
she
looked
at
wild
animals
in
the
menagerie
or
when
she
witnessed
a
storm
of
wind
or
shuddered
at
the
lightning
there
was
something
cosmic
in
such
things
and
there
was
something
cosmic
in
him
he
came
to
her
breathing
of
large
airs
and
great
spaces
the
blaze
of
tropic
suns
was
in
his
face
and
in
his
swelling
resilient
muscles
was
the
primordial
vigor
of
life
he
was
marred
and
scarred
by
that
mysterious
world
of
rough
men
and
rougher
deeds
the
outposts
of
which
began
beyond
her
horizon
he
was
untamed
wild
and
in
secret
ways
her
vanity
was
touched
by
the
fact
that
he
came
so
mildly
to
her
hand
likewise
she
was
stirred
by
the
common
impulse
to
tame
the
wild
thing
it
was
an
unconscious
impulse
and
farthest
from
her
thoughts
that
her
desire
was
to
the
clay
of
him
into
a
likeness
of
her
image
which
image
she
believed
to
be
the
finest
in
the
world
nor
was
there
any
way
out
of
her
inexperience
for
her
to
know
that
the
cosmic
feel
she
caught
of
him
was
that
most
cosmic
of
things
love
which
with
equal
power
drew
men
and
women
together
across
the
world
compelled
stags
to
kill
each
other
in
the
rutting
season
and
drove
even
the
elements
irresistibly
to
unite
his
swift
development
was
a
source
of
surprise
and
interest
she
detected
unguessed
finenesses
in
him
that
seemed
to
bud
day
by
day
like
flowers
in
congenial
soil
she
read
browning
aloud
to
him
and
was
often
puzzled
by
the
strange
interpretations
he
gave
to
mooted
passages
it
was
beyond
her
to
realize
that
out
of
his
experience
of
men
and
women
and
life
his
interpretations
were
far
more
frequently
correct
than
hers
his
conceptions
seemed
naive
to
her
though
she
was
often
fired
by
his
daring
flights
of
comprehension
whose
was
so
wide
among
the
stars
that
she
could
not
follow
and
could
only
sit
and
thrill
to
the
impact
of
unguessed
power
then
she
played
to
longer
at
probed
him
with
music
that
sank
to
depths
beyond
her
his
nature
opened
to
music
as
a
flower
to
the
sun
and
the
transition
was
quick
from
his
and
jingles
to
her
classical
display
pieces
that
she
knew
nearly
by
heart
yet
he
betrayed
a
democratic
fondness
for
wagner
and
the
overture
when
she
had
given
him
the
clew
to
it
claimed
him
as
nothing
else
she
played
in
an
immediate
way
it
personified
his
life
all
his
past
was
the
motif
while
her
he
identified
somehow
with
the
motif
and
from
the
exalted
state
this
elevated
him
to
he
swept
onward
and
upward
into
that
vast
of
where
good
and
evil
war
eternally
sometimes
he
questioned
and
induced
in
her
mind
temporary
doubts
as
to
the
correctness
of
her
own
definitions
and
conceptions
of
music
but
her
singing
he
did
not
question
it
was
too
wholly
her
and
he
sat
always
amazed
at
the
divine
melody
of
her
pure
soprano
voice
and
he
could
not
help
but
contrast
it
with
the
weak
pipings
and
shrill
quaverings
of
factory
girls
and
untrained
and
with
the
raucous
shriekings
from
throats
of
the
women
of
the
seaport
towns
she
enjoyed
singing
and
playing
to
him
in
truth
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
had
a
human
soul
to
play
with
and
the
plastic
clay
of
him
was
a
delight
to
mould
for
she
thought
she
was
moulding
it
and
her
intentions
were
good
besides
it
was
pleasant
to
be
with
him
he
did
not
repel
her
that
first
repulsion
had
been
really
a
fear
of
her
undiscovered
self
and
the
fear
had
gone
to
sleep
though
she
did
not
know
it
she
had
a
feeling
in
him
of
proprietary
right
also
he
had
a
tonic
effect
upon
her
she
was
studying
hard
at
the
university
and
it
seemed
to
strengthen
her
to
emerge
from
the
dusty
books
and
have
the
fresh
of
his
personality
blow
upon
her
strength
strength
was
what
she
needed
and
he
gave
it
to
her
in
generous
measure
to
come
into
the
same
room
with
him
or
to
meet
him
at
the
door
was
to
take
heart
of
life
and
when
he
had
gone
she
would
return
to
her
books
with
a
keener
zest
and
fresh
store
of
energy
she
knew
her
browning
but
it
had
never
sunk
into
her
that
it
was
an
awkward
thing
to
play
with
souls
as
her
interest
in
martin
increased
the
remodelling
of
his
life
became
a
passion
with
her
is
butler
she
said
one
afternoon
when
grammar
and
arithmetic
and
poetry
had
been
put
aside
had
comparatively
no
advantages
at
first
his
father
had
been
a
bank
cashier
but
he
lingered
for
years
dying
of
consumption
in
arizona
so
that
when
he
was
dead
butler
charles
butler
he
was
called
found
himself
alone
in
the
world
his
father
had
come
from
australia
you
know
and
so
he
had
no
relatives
in
california
he
went
to
work
in
a
have
heard
him
tell
of
it
many
times
he
got
three
dollars
a
week
at
first
his
income
is
at
least
thirty
thousand
a
year
how
did
he
do
it
he
was
honest
and
faithful
and
industrious
and
economical
he
denied
himself
the
enjoyments
that
most
boys
indulge
in
he
made
it
a
point
to
save
so
much
every
week
no
matter
what
he
had
to
do
without
in
order
to
save
it
of
course
he
was
soon
earning
more
than
three
dollars
a
week
and
as
his
wages
increased
he
saved
more
and
more
worked
in
the
daytime
and
at
night
he
went
to
night
school
he
had
his
eyes
fixed
always
on
the
future
later
on
he
went
to
night
high
school
when
he
was
only
seventeen
he
was
earning
excellent
wages
at
setting
type
but
he
was
ambitious
he
wanted
a
career
not
a
livelihood
and
he
was
content
to
make
immediate
sacrifices
for
his
ultimate
gain
he
decided
upon
the
law
and
he
entered
office
as
an
office
of
that
got
only
four
dollars
a
week
but
he
had
learned
how
to
be
economical
and
out
of
that
four
dollars
he
went
on
saving
she
paused
for
breath
and
to
note
how
martin
was
receiving
it
his
face
was
lighted
up
with
interest
in
the
youthful
struggles
of
butler
but
there
was
a
frown
upon
his
face
as
well
say
they
was
pretty
hard
lines
for
a
young
fellow
he
remarked
dollars
a
week
how
could
he
live
on
it
you
can
bet
he
have
any
frills
why
i
pay
five
dollars
a
week
for
board
now
about
it
you
can
lay
to
that
he
must
have
lived
like
a
dog
the
food
he
cooked
for
himself
she
interrupted
a
little
kerosene
food
he
ate
must
have
been
worse
than
what
a
sailor
gets
on
the
ships
than
which
there
much
that
can
be
possibly
think
of
him
now
she
cried
enthusiastically
of
what
his
income
affords
him
his
early
denials
are
paid
for
a
martin
looked
at
her
sharply
one
thing
bet
you
he
said
it
is
that
butler
is
now
in
his
fat
days
he
fed
himself
like
that
for
years
years
on
a
stomach
i
bet
his
none
too
good
now
for
her
eyes
dropped
before
his
searching
gaze
bet
got
dyspepsia
right
now
martin
challenged
he
has
she
confessed
i
bet
martin
dashed
on
solemn
serious
as
an
old
owl
care
a
rap
for
a
good
time
for
all
his
thirty
thousand
a
year
bet
not
particularly
joyful
at
others
have
a
good
time
i
right
she
nodded
her
head
in
agreement
and
hastened
to
explain
he
is
not
that
type
of
man
by
nature
he
is
sober
and
serious
he
always
was
can
bet
he
was
martin
proclaimed
dollars
a
week
four
dollars
a
week
a
young
boy
for
himself
on
an
up
money
all
day
all
night
just
never
never
a
good
time
never
how
to
have
a
good
course
his
thirty
thousand
came
along
too
his
sympathetic
imagination
was
flashing
upon
his
inner
sight
all
the
thousands
of
details
of
the
existence
and
of
his
narrow
spiritual
development
into
a
man
with
the
swiftness
and
of
multitudinous
thought
charles
whole
life
was
telescoped
upon
his
vision
you
know
he
added
feel
sorry
for
butler
he
was
too
young
to
know
better
but
he
robbed
himself
of
life
for
the
sake
of
thirty
thousand
a
year
clean
wasted
upon
him
why
thirty
thousand
lump
sum
buy
for
him
right
now
what
ten
cents
he
was
up
would
have
bought
him
when
he
was
a
kid
in
the
way
of
candy
peanuts
or
a
seat
in
nigger
it
was
just
such
uniqueness
of
points
of
view
that
startled
ruth
not
only
were
they
new
to
her
and
contrary
to
her
own
beliefs
but
she
always
felt
in
them
germs
of
truth
that
threatened
to
unseat
or
modify
her
own
convictions
had
she
been
fourteen
instead
of
she
might
have
been
changed
by
them
but
she
was
conservative
by
nature
and
upbringing
and
already
crystallized
into
the
cranny
of
life
where
she
had
been
born
and
formed
it
was
true
his
bizarre
judgments
troubled
her
in
the
moments
they
were
uttered
but
she
ascribed
them
to
his
novelty
of
type
and
strangeness
of
living
and
they
were
soon
forgotten
nevertheless
while
she
disapproved
of
them
the
strength
of
their
utterance
and
the
flashing
of
eyes
and
earnestness
of
face
that
accompanied
them
always
thrilled
her
and
drew
her
toward
him
she
would
never
have
guessed
that
this
man
who
had
come
from
beyond
her
horizon
was
in
such
moments
flashing
on
beyond
her
horizon
with
wider
and
deeper
concepts
her
own
limits
were
the
limits
of
her
horizon
but
limited
minds
can
recognize
limitations
only
in
others
and
so
she
felt
that
her
outlook
was
very
wide
indeed
and
that
where
his
conflicted
with
hers
marked
his
limitations
and
she
dreamed
of
helping
him
to
see
as
she
saw
of
widening
his
horizon
until
it
was
identified
with
hers
i
have
not
finished
my
story
she
said
worked
so
father
says
as
no
other
office
boy
he
ever
had
butler
was
always
eager
to
work
he
never
was
late
and
he
was
usually
at
the
office
a
few
minutes
before
his
regular
time
and
yet
he
saved
his
time
every
spare
moment
was
devoted
to
study
he
studied
and
and
he
paid
for
lessons
in
shorthand
by
dictating
at
night
to
a
court
reporter
who
needed
practice
he
quickly
became
a
clerk
and
he
made
himself
invaluable
father
appreciated
him
and
saw
that
he
was
bound
to
rise
it
was
on
suggestion
that
he
went
to
law
college
he
became
a
lawyer
and
hardly
was
he
back
in
the
office
when
father
took
him
in
as
junior
partner
he
is
a
great
man
he
refused
the
united
states
senate
several
times
and
father
says
he
could
become
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
any
time
a
vacancy
occurs
if
he
wants
to
such
a
life
is
an
inspiration
to
all
of
us
it
shows
us
that
a
man
with
will
may
rise
superior
to
his
is
a
great
man
martin
said
sincerely
but
it
seemed
to
him
there
was
something
in
the
recital
that
jarred
upon
his
sense
of
beauty
and
life
he
could
not
find
an
adequate
motive
in
life
of
pinching
and
privation
had
he
done
it
for
love
of
a
woman
or
for
attainment
of
beauty
martin
would
have
understood
own
mad
lover
should
do
anything
for
the
kiss
but
not
for
thirty
thousand
dollars
a
year
he
was
dissatisfied
with
career
there
was
something
paltry
about
it
after
all
thirty
thousand
a
year
was
all
right
but
dyspepsia
and
inability
to
be
humanly
happy
robbed
such
princely
income
of
all
its
value
much
of
this
he
strove
to
express
to
ruth
and
shocked
her
and
made
it
clear
that
more
remodelling
was
necessary
hers
was
that
common
insularity
of
mind
that
makes
human
creatures
believe
that
their
color
creed
and
politics
are
best
and
right
and
that
other
human
creatures
scattered
over
the
world
are
less
fortunately
placed
than
they
it
was
the
same
insularity
of
mind
that
made
the
ancient
jew
thank
god
he
was
not
born
a
woman
and
sent
the
modern
missionary
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
it
made
ruth
desire
to
shape
this
man
from
other
crannies
of
life
into
the
likeness
of
the
men
who
lived
in
her
particular
cranny
of
life
chapter
ix
back
from
sea
martin
eden
came
homing
for
california
with
a
desire
his
store
of
money
exhausted
he
had
shipped
before
the
mast
on
the
schooner
and
the
solomon
islands
after
eight
months
of
failure
to
find
treasure
had
witnessed
the
breaking
up
of
the
expedition
the
men
had
been
paid
off
in
australia
and
martin
had
immediately
shipped
on
a
vessel
for
san
francisco
not
alone
had
those
eight
months
earned
him
enough
money
to
stay
on
land
for
many
weeks
but
they
had
enabled
him
to
do
a
great
deal
of
studying
and
reading
his
was
the
mind
and
behind
his
ability
to
learn
was
the
indomitability
of
his
nature
and
his
love
for
ruth
the
grammar
he
had
taken
along
he
went
through
again
and
again
until
his
unjaded
brain
had
mastered
it
he
noticed
the
bad
grammar
used
by
his
shipmates
and
made
a
point
of
mentally
correcting
and
reconstructing
their
crudities
of
speech
to
his
great
joy
he
discovered
that
his
ear
was
becoming
sensitive
and
that
he
was
developing
grammatical
nerves
a
double
negative
jarred
him
like
a
discord
and
often
from
lack
of
practice
it
was
from
his
own
lips
that
the
jar
came
his
tongue
refused
to
learn
new
tricks
in
a
day
after
he
had
been
through
the
grammar
repeatedly
he
took
up
the
dictionary
and
added
twenty
words
a
day
to
his
vocabulary
he
found
that
this
was
no
light
task
and
at
wheel
or
lookout
he
steadily
went
over
and
over
his
lengthening
list
of
pronunciations
and
definitions
while
he
invariably
memorized
himself
to
sleep
did
anything
i
were
and
things
were
phrases
with
many
variations
that
he
repeated
under
his
breath
in
order
to
accustom
his
tongue
to
the
language
spoken
by
ruth
and
with
the
and
pronounced
emphatically
he
went
over
thousands
of
times
and
to
his
surprise
he
noticed
that
he
was
beginning
to
speak
cleaner
and
more
correct
english
than
the
officers
themselves
and
the
in
the
cabin
who
had
financed
the
expedition
the
captain
was
a
norwegian
who
somehow
had
fallen
into
possession
of
a
complete
shakespeare
which
he
never
read
and
martin
had
washed
his
clothes
for
him
and
in
return
been
permitted
access
to
the
precious
volumes
for
a
time
so
steeped
was
he
in
the
plays
and
in
the
many
favorite
passages
that
impressed
themselves
almost
without
effort
on
his
brain
that
all
the
world
seemed
to
shape
itself
into
forms
of
elizabethan
tragedy
or
comedy
and
his
very
thoughts
were
in
blank
verse
it
trained
his
ear
and
gave
him
a
fine
appreciation
for
noble
english
withal
it
introduced
into
his
mind
much
that
was
archaic
and
obsolete
the
eight
months
had
been
well
spent
and
in
addition
to
what
he
had
learned
of
right
speaking
and
high
thinking
he
had
learned
much
of
himself
along
with
his
humbleness
because
he
knew
so
little
there
arose
a
conviction
of
power
he
felt
a
sharp
gradation
between
himself
and
his
shipmates
and
was
wise
enough
to
realize
that
the
difference
lay
in
potentiality
rather
than
achievement
what
he
could
do
could
do
but
within
him
he
felt
a
confused
ferment
working
that
told
him
there
was
more
in
him
than
he
had
done
he
was
tortured
by
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
world
and
wished
that
ruth
were
there
to
share
it
with
him
he
decided
that
he
would
describe
to
her
many
of
the
bits
of
south
sea
beauty
the
creative
spirit
in
him
flamed
up
at
the
thought
and
urged
that
he
recreate
this
beauty
for
a
wider
audience
than
ruth
and
then
in
splendor
and
glory
came
the
great
idea
he
would
write
he
would
be
one
of
the
eyes
through
which
the
world
saw
one
of
the
ears
through
which
it
heard
one
of
the
hearts
through
which
it
felt
he
would
and
prose
fiction
and
description
and
plays
like
shakespeare
there
was
career
and
the
way
to
win
to
ruth
the
men
of
literature
were
the
giants
and
he
conceived
them
to
be
far
finer
than
the
butlers
who
earned
thirty
thousand
a
year
and
could
be
supreme
court
justices
if
they
wanted
to
once
the
idea
had
germinated
it
mastered
him
and
the
return
voyage
to
san
francisco
was
like
a
dream
he
was
drunken
with
unguessed
power
and
felt
that
he
could
do
anything
in
the
midst
of
the
great
and
lonely
sea
he
gained
perspective
clearly
and
for
the
first
time
he
saw
ruth
and
her
world
it
was
all
visualized
in
his
mind
as
a
concrete
thing
which
he
could
take
up
in
his
two
hands
and
turn
around
and
about
and
examine
there
was
much
that
was
dim
and
nebulous
in
that
world
but
he
saw
it
as
a
whole
and
not
in
detail
and
he
saw
also
the
way
to
master
it
to
write
the
thought
was
fire
in
him
he
would
begin
as
soon
as
he
got
back
the
first
thing
he
would
do
would
be
to
describe
the
voyage
of
the
he
would
sell
it
to
some
san
francisco
newspaper
he
would
not
tell
ruth
anything
about
it
and
she
would
be
surprised
and
pleased
when
she
saw
his
name
in
print
while
he
wrote
he
could
go
on
studying
there
were
hours
in
each
day
he
was
invincible
he
knew
how
to
work
and
the
citadels
would
go
down
before
him
he
would
not
have
to
go
to
sea
a
sailor
and
for
the
instant
he
caught
a
vision
of
a
steam
yacht
there
were
other
writers
who
possessed
steam
yachts
of
course
he
cautioned
himself
it
would
be
slow
succeeding
at
first
and
for
a
time
he
would
be
content
to
earn
enough
money
by
his
writing
to
enable
him
to
go
on
studying
and
then
after
some
time
very
indeterminate
time
he
had
learned
and
prepared
himself
he
would
write
the
great
things
and
his
name
would
be
on
all
lips
but
greater
than
that
infinitely
greater
and
greatest
of
all
he
would
have
proved
himself
worthy
of
ruth
fame
was
all
very
well
but
it
was
for
ruth
that
his
splendid
dream
arose
he
was
not
a
but
merely
one
of
mad
lovers
arrived
in
oakland
with
his
snug
in
his
pocket
he
took
up
his
old
room
at
bernard
and
set
to
work
he
did
not
even
let
ruth
know
he
was
back
he
would
go
and
see
her
when
he
finished
the
article
on
the
it
was
not
so
difficult
to
abstain
from
seeing
her
because
of
the
violent
heat
of
creative
fever
that
burned
in
him
besides
the
very
article
he
was
writing
would
bring
her
nearer
to
him
he
did
not
know
how
long
an
article
he
should
write
but
he
counted
the
words
in
a
article
in
the
sunday
supplement
of
the
francisco
and
guided
himself
by
that
three
days
at
white
heat
completed
his
narrative
but
when
he
had
copied
it
carefully
in
a
large
scrawl
that
was
easy
to
read
he
learned
from
a
rhetoric
he
picked
up
in
the
library
that
there
were
such
things
as
paragraphs
and
quotation
marks
he
had
never
thought
of
such
things
before
and
he
promptly
set
to
work
writing
the
article
over
referring
continually
to
the
pages
of
the
rhetoric
and
learning
more
in
a
day
about
composition
than
the
average
schoolboy
in
a
year
when
he
had
copied
the
article
a
second
time
and
rolled
it
up
carefully
he
read
in
a
newspaper
an
item
on
hints
to
beginners
and
discovered
the
iron
law
that
manuscripts
should
never
be
rolled
and
that
they
should
be
written
on
one
side
of
the
paper
he
had
violated
the
law
on
both
counts
also
he
learned
from
the
item
that
papers
paid
a
minimum
of
ten
dollars
a
column
so
while
he
copied
the
manuscript
a
third
time
he
consoled
himself
by
multiplying
ten
columns
by
ten
dollars
the
product
was
always
the
same
one
hundred
dollars
and
he
decided
that
that
was
better
than
seafaring
if
it
been
for
his
blunders
he
would
have
finished
the
article
in
three
days
one
hundred
dollars
in
three
days
it
would
have
taken
him
three
months
and
longer
on
the
sea
to
earn
a
similar
amount
a
man
was
a
fool
to
go
to
sea
when
he
could
write
he
concluded
though
the
money
in
itself
meant
nothing
to
him
its
value
was
in
the
liberty
it
would
get
him
the
presentable
garments
it
would
buy
him
all
of
which
would
bring
him
nearer
swiftly
nearer
to
the
slender
pale
girl
who
had
turned
his
life
back
upon
itself
and
given
him
inspiration
he
mailed
the
manuscript
in
a
flat
envelope
and
addressed
it
to
the
editor
of
the
francisco
he
had
an
idea
that
anything
accepted
by
a
paper
was
published
immediately
and
as
he
had
sent
the
manuscript
in
on
friday
he
expected
it
to
come
out
on
the
following
sunday
he
conceived
that
it
would
be
fine
to
let
that
event
apprise
ruth
of
his
return
then
sunday
afternoon
he
would
call
and
see
her
in
the
meantime
he
was
occupied
by
another
idea
which
he
prided
himself
upon
as
being
a
particularly
sane
careful
and
modest
idea
he
would
write
an
adventure
story
for
boys
and
sell
it
to
he
went
to
the
free
and
looked
through
the
files
of
serial
stories
he
found
were
usually
published
in
that
weekly
in
five
instalments
of
about
three
thousand
words
each
he
discovered
several
serials
that
ran
to
seven
instalments
and
decided
to
write
one
of
that
length
he
had
been
on
a
whaling
voyage
in
the
arctic
voyage
that
was
to
have
been
for
three
years
and
which
had
terminated
in
shipwreck
at
the
end
of
six
months
while
his
imagination
was
fanciful
even
fantastic
at
times
he
had
a
basic
love
of
reality
that
compelled
him
to
write
about
the
things
he
knew
he
knew
whaling
and
out
of
the
real
materials
of
his
knowledge
he
proceeded
to
manufacture
the
fictitious
adventures
of
the
two
boys
he
intended
to
use
as
joint
heroes
it
was
easy
work
he
decided
on
saturday
evening
he
had
completed
on
that
day
the
first
instalment
of
three
thousand
to
the
amusement
of
jim
and
to
the
open
derision
of
higginbotham
who
sneered
throughout
at
the
person
they
had
discovered
in
the
family
martin
contented
himself
by
picturing
his
surprise
on
sunday
morning
when
he
opened
his
and
saw
the
article
on
the
early
that
morning
he
was
out
himself
to
the
front
door
nervously
racing
through
the
newspaper
he
went
through
it
a
second
time
very
carefully
then
folded
it
up
and
left
it
where
he
had
found
it
he
was
glad
he
had
not
told
any
one
about
his
article
on
second
thought
he
concluded
that
he
had
been
wrong
about
the
speed
with
which
things
found
their
way
into
newspaper
columns
besides
there
had
not
been
any
news
value
in
his
article
and
most
likely
the
editor
would
write
to
him
about
it
first
after
breakfast
he
went
on
with
his
serial
the
words
flowed
from
his
pen
though
he
broke
off
from
the
writing
frequently
to
look
up
definitions
in
the
dictionary
or
to
refer
to
the
rhetoric
he
often
read
or
a
chapter
at
a
time
during
such
pauses
and
he
consoled
himself
that
while
he
was
not
writing
the
great
things
he
felt
to
be
in
him
he
was
learning
composition
at
any
rate
and
training
himself
to
shape
up
and
express
his
thoughts
he
toiled
on
till
dark
when
he
went
out
to
the
and
explored
magazines
and
weeklies
until
the
place
closed
at
ten
this
was
his
programme
for
a
week
each
day
he
did
three
thousand
words
and
each
evening
he
puzzled
his
way
through
the
magazines
taking
note
of
the
stories
articles
and
poems
that
editors
saw
fit
to
publish
one
thing
was
certain
what
these
multitudinous
writers
did
he
could
do
and
only
give
him
time
and
he
would
do
what
they
could
not
do
he
was
cheered
to
read
in
in
a
paragraph
on
the
payment
of
magazine
writers
not
that
rudyard
kipling
received
a
dollar
per
word
but
that
the
minimum
rate
paid
by
magazines
was
two
cents
a
word
was
certainly
first
class
and
at
that
rate
the
three
thousand
words
he
had
written
that
day
would
bring
him
sixty
wages
on
the
sea
on
friday
night
he
finished
the
serial
thousand
words
long
at
two
cents
a
word
he
calculated
that
would
bring
him
four
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
not
a
bad
work
it
was
more
money
than
he
had
ever
possessed
at
one
time
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
spend
it
all
he
had
tapped
a
gold
mine
where
this
came
from
he
could
always
get
more
he
planned
to
buy
some
more
clothes
to
subscribe
to
many
magazines
and
to
buy
dozens
of
reference
books
that
at
present
he
was
compelled
to
go
to
the
library
to
consult
and
still
there
was
a
large
portion
of
the
four
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
unspent
this
worried
him
until
the
thought
came
to
him
of
hiring
a
servant
for
gertrude
and
of
buying
a
bicycle
for
marian
he
mailed
the
bulky
manuscript
to
and
on
saturday
afternoon
after
having
planned
an
article
on
he
went
to
see
ruth
he
had
telephoned
and
she
went
herself
to
greet
him
at
the
door
the
old
familiar
blaze
of
health
rushed
out
from
him
and
struck
her
like
a
blow
it
seemed
to
enter
into
her
body
and
course
through
her
veins
in
a
liquid
glow
and
to
set
her
quivering
with
its
imparted
strength
he
flushed
warmly
as
he
took
her
hand
and
looked
into
her
blue
eyes
but
the
fresh
bronze
of
eight
months
of
sun
hid
the
flush
though
it
did
not
protect
the
neck
from
the
gnawing
chafe
of
the
stiff
collar
she
noted
the
red
line
of
it
with
amusement
which
quickly
vanished
as
she
glanced
at
his
clothes
they
really
fitted
him
was
his
first
suit
he
seemed
slimmer
and
better
modelled
in
addition
his
cloth
cap
had
been
replaced
by
a
soft
hat
which
she
commanded
him
to
put
on
and
then
complimented
him
on
his
appearance
she
did
not
remember
when
she
had
felt
so
happy
this
change
in
him
was
her
handiwork
and
she
was
proud
of
it
and
fired
with
ambition
further
to
help
him
but
the
most
radical
change
of
all
and
the
one
that
pleased
her
most
was
the
change
in
his
speech
not
only
did
he
speak
more
correctly
but
he
spoke
more
easily
and
there
were
many
new
words
in
his
vocabulary
when
he
grew
excited
or
enthusiastic
however
he
dropped
back
into
the
old
slurring
and
the
dropping
of
final
consonants
also
there
was
an
awkward
hesitancy
at
times
as
he
essayed
the
new
words
he
had
learned
on
the
other
hand
along
with
his
ease
of
expression
he
displayed
a
lightness
and
facetiousness
of
thought
that
delighted
her
it
was
his
old
spirit
of
humor
and
badinage
that
had
made
him
a
favorite
in
his
own
class
but
which
he
had
hitherto
been
unable
to
use
in
her
presence
through
lack
of
words
and
training
he
was
just
beginning
to
orientate
himself
and
to
feel
that
he
was
not
wholly
an
intruder
but
he
was
very
tentative
fastidiously
so
letting
ruth
set
the
pace
of
sprightliness
and
fancy
keeping
up
with
her
but
never
daring
to
go
beyond
her
he
told
her
of
what
he
had
been
doing
and
of
his
plan
to
write
for
a
livelihood
and
of
going
on
with
his
studies
but
he
was
disappointed
at
her
lack
of
approval
she
did
not
think
much
of
his
plan
see
she
said
frankly
must
be
a
trade
like
anything
else
not
that
i
know
anything
about
it
of
course
i
only
bring
common
judgment
to
bear
you
hope
to
be
a
blacksmith
without
spending
three
years
at
learning
the
is
it
five
years
now
writers
are
so
much
better
paid
than
blacksmiths
that
there
must
be
ever
so
many
more
men
who
would
like
to
write
to
then
may
not
i
be
peculiarly
constituted
to
write
he
queried
secretly
exulting
at
the
language
he
had
used
his
swift
imagination
throwing
the
whole
scene
and
atmosphere
upon
a
vast
screen
along
with
a
thousand
other
scenes
from
his
that
were
rough
and
raw
gross
and
bestial
the
whole
composite
vision
was
achieved
with
the
speed
of
light
producing
no
pause
in
the
conversation
nor
interrupting
his
calm
train
of
thought
on
the
screen
of
his
imagination
he
saw
himself
and
this
sweet
and
beautiful
girl
facing
each
other
and
conversing
in
good
english
in
a
room
of
books
and
paintings
and
tone
and
culture
and
all
illuminated
by
a
bright
light
of
steadfast
brilliance
while
ranged
about
and
fading
away
to
the
remote
edges
of
the
screen
were
antithetical
scenes
each
scene
a
picture
and
he
the
onlooker
free
to
look
at
will
upon
what
he
wished
he
saw
these
other
scenes
through
drifting
vapors
and
swirls
of
sullen
fog
dissolving
before
shafts
of
red
and
garish
light
he
saw
cowboys
at
the
bar
drinking
fierce
whiskey
the
air
filled
with
obscenity
and
ribald
language
and
he
saw
himself
with
them
drinking
and
cursing
with
the
wildest
or
sitting
at
table
with
them
under
smoking
kerosene
lamps
while
the
chips
clicked
and
clattered
and
the
cards
were
dealt
around
he
saw
himself
stripped
to
the
waist
with
naked
fists
fighting
his
great
fight
with
liverpool
red
in
the
forecastle
of
the
and
he
saw
the
bloody
deck
of
the
that
gray
morning
of
attempted
mutiny
the
mate
kicking
in
on
the
the
revolver
in
the
old
hand
spitting
fire
and
smoke
the
men
with
faces
of
brutes
screaming
vile
blasphemies
and
falling
about
then
he
returned
to
the
central
scene
calm
and
clean
in
the
steadfast
light
where
ruth
sat
and
talked
with
him
amid
books
and
paintings
and
he
saw
the
grand
piano
upon
which
she
would
later
play
to
him
and
he
heard
the
echoes
of
his
own
selected
and
correct
words
then
may
i
not
be
peculiarly
constituted
to
write
no
matter
how
peculiarly
constituted
a
man
may
be
for
blacksmithing
she
was
laughing
never
heard
of
one
becoming
a
blacksmith
without
first
serving
his
would
you
advise
he
asked
forget
that
i
feel
in
me
this
capacity
to
explain
it
i
just
know
that
it
is
in
must
get
a
thorough
education
was
the
answer
or
not
you
ultimately
become
a
writer
this
education
is
indispensable
for
whatever
career
you
select
and
it
must
not
be
slipshod
or
sketchy
you
should
go
to
high
he
began
but
she
interrupted
with
an
afterthought
course
you
could
go
on
with
your
writing
would
have
to
he
said
grimly
she
looked
at
him
prettily
puzzled
for
she
did
not
quite
like
the
persistence
with
which
he
clung
to
his
notion
without
writing
there
be
any
high
school
i
must
live
and
buy
books
and
clothes
you
forgotten
that
she
laughed
you
born
with
an
income
rather
have
good
health
and
imagination
he
answered
can
make
good
on
the
income
but
the
other
things
have
to
be
made
good
he
almost
said
then
amended
his
sentence
to
to
be
made
good
for
say
good
she
cried
sweetly
petulant
slang
and
he
flushed
and
stammered
right
and
i
only
wish
correct
me
every
like
to
she
said
haltingly
have
so
much
in
you
that
is
good
that
i
want
to
see
you
he
was
clay
in
her
hands
immediately
as
passionately
desirous
of
being
moulded
by
her
as
she
was
desirous
of
shaping
him
into
the
image
of
her
ideal
of
man
and
when
she
pointed
out
the
opportuneness
of
the
time
that
the
entrance
examinations
to
high
school
began
on
the
following
monday
he
promptly
volunteered
that
he
would
take
them
then
she
played
and
sang
to
him
while
he
gazed
with
hungry
yearning
at
her
drinking
in
her
loveliness
and
marvelling
that
there
should
not
be
a
hundred
suitors
listening
there
and
longing
for
her
as
he
listened
and
longed
chapter
x
he
stopped
to
dinner
that
evening
and
much
to
satisfaction
made
a
favorable
impression
on
her
father
they
talked
about
the
sea
as
a
career
a
subject
which
martin
had
at
his
and
morse
remarked
afterward
that
he
seemed
a
very
young
man
in
his
avoidance
of
slang
and
his
search
after
right
words
martin
was
compelled
to
talk
slowly
which
enabled
him
to
find
the
best
thoughts
that
were
in
him
he
was
more
at
ease
than
that
first
night
at
dinner
nearly
a
year
before
and
his
shyness
and
modesty
even
commended
him
to
morse
who
was
pleased
at
his
manifest
improvement
is
the
first
man
that
ever
drew
passing
notice
from
ruth
she
told
her
husband
has
been
so
singularly
backward
where
men
are
concerned
that
i
have
been
worried
morse
looked
at
his
wife
curiously
mean
to
use
this
young
sailor
to
wake
her
up
he
questioned
mean
that
she
is
not
to
die
an
old
maid
if
i
can
help
it
was
the
answer
this
young
eden
can
arouse
her
interest
in
mankind
in
general
it
will
be
a
good
very
good
thing
he
commented
suppose
we
must
suppose
sometimes
my
dear
he
arouses
her
interest
too
particularly
in
him
morse
laughed
is
three
years
older
than
he
and
besides
it
is
impossible
nothing
will
ever
come
of
it
trust
that
to
and
so
rôle
was
arranged
for
him
while
he
led
on
by
arthur
and
norman
was
meditating
an
extravagance
they
were
going
out
for
a
ride
into
the
hills
sunday
morning
on
their
wheels
which
did
not
interest
martin
until
he
learned
that
ruth
too
rode
a
wheel
and
was
going
along
he
did
not
ride
nor
own
a
wheel
but
if
ruth
rode
it
was
up
to
him
to
begin
was
his
decision
and
when
he
said
good
night
he
stopped
in
at
a
cyclery
on
his
way
home
and
spent
forty
dollars
for
a
wheel
it
was
more
than
a
wages
and
it
reduced
his
stock
of
money
amazingly
but
when
he
added
the
hundred
dollars
he
was
to
receive
from
the
to
the
four
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
that
was
the
least
could
pay
him
he
felt
that
he
had
reduced
the
perplexity
the
unwonted
amount
of
money
had
caused
him
nor
did
he
mind
in
the
course
of
learning
to
ride
the
wheel
home
the
fact
that
he
ruined
his
suit
of
clothes
he
caught
the
tailor
by
telephone
that
night
from
store
and
ordered
another
suit
then
he
carried
the
wheel
up
the
narrow
stairway
that
clung
like
a
to
the
rear
wall
of
the
building
and
when
he
had
moved
his
bed
out
from
the
wall
found
there
was
just
space
enough
in
the
small
room
for
himself
and
the
wheel
sunday
he
had
intended
to
devote
to
studying
for
the
high
school
examination
but
the
article
lured
him
away
and
he
spent
the
day
in
the
fever
of
the
beauty
and
romance
that
burned
in
him
the
fact
that
the
of
that
morning
had
failed
to
publish
his
article
did
not
dash
his
spirits
he
was
at
too
great
a
height
for
that
and
having
been
deaf
to
a
summons
he
went
without
the
heavy
sunday
dinner
with
which
higginbotham
invariably
graced
his
table
to
higginbotham
such
a
dinner
was
advertisement
of
his
worldly
achievement
and
prosperity
and
he
honored
it
by
delivering
platitudinous
sermonettes
upon
american
institutions
and
the
opportunity
said
institutions
gave
to
any
man
to
rise
in
his
case
which
he
pointed
out
unfailingly
being
from
a
clerk
to
the
ownership
of
cash
store
martin
eden
looked
with
a
sigh
at
his
unfinished
on
monday
morning
and
took
the
car
down
to
oakland
to
the
high
school
and
when
days
later
he
applied
for
the
results
of
his
examinations
he
learned
that
he
had
failed
in
everything
save
grammar
grammar
is
excellent
professor
hilton
informed
him
staring
at
him
through
heavy
spectacles
you
know
nothing
positively
nothing
in
the
other
branches
and
your
united
states
history
is
is
no
other
word
for
it
abominable
i
should
advise
professor
hilton
paused
and
glared
at
him
unsympathetic
and
unimaginative
as
one
of
his
own
he
was
professor
of
physics
in
the
high
school
possessor
of
a
large
family
a
meagre
salary
and
a
select
fund
of
knowledge
sir
martin
said
humbly
wishing
somehow
that
the
man
at
the
desk
in
the
library
was
in
professor
place
just
then
i
should
advise
you
to
go
back
to
the
grammar
school
for
at
least
two
years
good
martin
was
not
deeply
affected
by
his
failure
though
he
was
surprised
at
shocked
expression
when
he
told
her
professor
advice
her
disappointment
was
so
evident
that
he
was
sorry
he
had
failed
but
chiefly
so
for
her
sake
see
i
was
right
she
said
know
far
more
than
any
of
the
students
entering
high
school
and
yet
you
pass
the
examinations
it
is
because
what
education
you
have
is
fragmentary
sketchy
you
need
the
discipline
of
study
such
as
only
skilled
teachers
can
give
you
you
must
be
thoroughly
grounded
professor
hilton
is
right
and
if
i
were
you
go
to
night
school
a
year
and
a
half
of
it
might
enable
you
to
catch
up
that
additional
six
months
besides
that
would
leave
you
your
days
in
which
to
write
or
if
you
could
not
make
your
living
by
your
pen
you
would
have
your
days
in
which
to
work
in
some
but
if
my
days
are
taken
up
with
work
and
my
nights
with
school
when
am
i
going
to
see
you
first
thought
though
he
refrained
from
uttering
it
instead
he
said
seems
so
babyish
for
me
to
be
going
to
night
school
but
i
mind
that
if
i
thought
it
would
pay
but
i
think
it
will
pay
i
can
do
the
work
quicker
than
they
can
teach
me
it
would
be
a
loss
of
he
thought
of
her
and
his
desire
to
have
i
afford
the
time
i
the
time
to
spare
in
is
so
much
that
is
she
looked
at
him
gently
and
he
was
a
brute
to
oppose
her
and
do
them
without
laboratory
study
and
find
algebra
and
geometry
almost
hopeless
without
instruction
you
need
the
skilled
teachers
the
specialists
in
the
art
of
imparting
he
was
silent
for
a
minute
casting
about
for
the
least
vainglorious
way
in
which
to
express
himself
think
bragging
he
began
intend
it
that
way
at
all
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
i
am
what
i
may
call
a
natural
student
i
can
study
by
myself
i
take
to
it
kindly
like
a
duck
to
water
you
see
yourself
what
i
did
with
grammar
and
learned
much
of
other
would
never
dream
how
much
and
only
getting
started
wait
till
i
he
hesitated
and
assured
himself
of
the
pronunciation
before
he
said
getting
my
first
real
feel
of
things
now
beginning
to
size
up
the
say
up
she
interrupted
get
a
line
on
things
he
hastily
amended
mean
anything
in
correct
english
she
objected
he
floundered
for
a
fresh
start
driving
at
is
that
beginning
to
get
the
lay
of
the
out
of
pity
she
forebore
and
he
went
on
seems
to
me
like
a
whenever
i
go
into
the
library
i
am
impressed
that
way
the
part
played
by
teachers
is
to
teach
the
student
the
contents
of
the
in
a
systematic
way
the
teachers
are
guides
to
the
all
not
something
that
they
have
in
their
own
heads
they
make
it
up
create
it
all
in
the
and
they
know
their
way
about
in
it
and
their
business
to
show
the
place
to
strangers
who
might
else
get
lost
now
i
get
lost
easily
i
have
the
bump
of
location
i
usually
know
where
wrong
now
say
right
he
said
gratefully
i
am
but
where
am
i
mean
where
am
i
oh
yes
in
the
well
some
she
corrected
persons
need
guides
most
persons
do
but
i
think
i
can
get
along
without
them
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
the
now
and
on
the
edge
of
knowing
my
way
about
what
charts
i
want
to
refer
to
what
coasts
i
want
to
explore
and
from
the
way
i
line
it
up
explore
a
whole
lot
more
quickly
by
myself
the
speed
of
a
fleet
you
know
is
the
speed
of
the
slowest
ship
and
the
speed
of
the
teachers
is
affected
the
same
way
they
go
any
faster
than
the
ruck
of
their
scholars
and
i
can
set
a
faster
pace
for
myself
than
they
set
for
a
whole
travels
the
fastest
who
travels
alone
she
quoted
at
him
but
travel
faster
with
you
just
the
same
was
what
he
wanted
to
blurt
out
as
he
caught
a
vision
of
a
world
without
end
of
sunlit
spaces
and
starry
voids
through
which
he
drifted
with
her
his
arm
around
her
her
pale
gold
hair
blowing
about
his
face
in
the
same
instant
he
was
aware
of
the
pitiful
inadequacy
of
speech
god
if
he
could
so
frame
words
that
she
could
see
what
he
then
saw
and
he
felt
the
stir
in
him
like
a
throe
of
yearning
pain
of
the
desire
to
paint
these
visions
that
flashed
unsummoned
on
the
mirror
of
his
mind
ah
that
was
it
he
caught
at
the
hem
of
the
secret
it
was
the
very
thing
that
the
great
writers
and
did
that
was
why
they
were
giants
they
knew
how
to
express
what
they
thought
and
felt
and
saw
dogs
asleep
in
the
sun
often
whined
and
barked
but
they
were
unable
to
tell
what
they
saw
that
made
them
whine
and
bark
he
had
often
wondered
what
it
was
and
that
was
all
he
was
a
dog
asleep
in
the
sun
he
saw
noble
and
beautiful
visions
but
he
could
only
whine
and
bark
at
ruth
but
he
would
cease
sleeping
in
the
sun
he
would
stand
up
with
open
eyes
and
he
would
struggle
and
toil
and
learn
until
with
eyes
unblinded
and
tongue
untied
he
could
share
with
her
his
visioned
wealth
other
men
had
discovered
the
trick
of
expression
of
making
words
obedient
servitors
and
of
making
combinations
of
words
mean
more
than
the
sum
of
their
separate
meanings
he
was
stirred
profoundly
by
the
passing
glimpse
at
the
secret
and
he
was
again
caught
up
in
the
vision
of
sunlit
spaces
and
starry
it
came
to
him
that
it
was
very
quiet
and
he
saw
ruth
regarding
him
with
an
amused
expression
and
a
smile
in
her
eyes
have
had
a
great
visioning
he
said
and
at
the
sound
of
his
words
in
his
own
ears
his
heart
gave
a
leap
where
had
those
words
come
from
they
had
adequately
expressed
the
pause
his
vision
had
put
in
the
conversation
it
was
a
miracle
never
had
he
so
loftily
framed
a
lofty
thought
but
never
had
he
attempted
to
frame
lofty
thoughts
in
words
that
was
it
that
explained
it
he
had
never
tried
but
swinburne
had
and
tennyson
and
kipling
and
all
the
other
poets
his
mind
flashed
on
to
his
he
had
never
dared
the
big
things
the
spirit
of
the
beauty
that
was
a
fire
in
him
that
article
would
be
a
different
thing
when
he
was
done
with
it
he
was
appalled
by
the
vastness
of
the
beauty
that
rightfully
belonged
in
it
and
again
his
mind
flashed
and
dared
and
he
demanded
of
himself
why
he
could
not
chant
that
beauty
in
noble
verse
as
the
great
poets
did
and
there
was
all
the
mysterious
delight
and
spiritual
wonder
of
his
love
for
ruth
why
could
he
not
chant
that
too
as
the
poets
did
they
had
sung
of
love
so
would
he
by
god
and
in
his
frightened
ears
he
heard
his
exclamation
echoing
carried
away
he
had
breathed
it
aloud
the
blood
surged
into
his
face
wave
upon
wave
mastering
the
bronze
of
it
till
the
blush
of
shame
flaunted
itself
from
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
your
pardon
he
stammered
was
sounded
as
if
you
were
praying
she
said
bravely
but
she
felt
herself
inside
to
be
withering
and
shrinking
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
heard
an
oath
from
the
lips
of
a
man
she
knew
and
she
was
shocked
not
merely
as
a
matter
of
principle
and
training
but
shocked
in
spirit
by
this
rough
blast
of
life
in
the
garden
of
her
sheltered
maidenhood
but
she
forgave
and
with
surprise
at
the
ease
of
her
forgiveness
somehow
it
was
not
so
difficult
to
forgive
him
anything
he
had
not
had
a
chance
to
be
as
other
men
and
he
was
trying
so
hard
and
succeeding
too
it
never
entered
her
head
that
there
could
be
any
other
reason
for
her
being
kindly
disposed
toward
him
she
was
tenderly
disposed
toward
him
but
she
did
not
know
it
she
had
no
way
of
knowing
it
the
placid
poise
of
years
without
a
single
love
affair
did
not
fit
her
with
a
keen
perception
of
her
own
feelings
and
she
who
had
never
warmed
to
actual
love
was
unaware
that
she
was
warming
now
chapter
xi
martin
went
back
to
his
article
which
would
have
been
finished
sooner
if
it
had
not
been
broken
in
upon
so
frequently
by
his
attempts
to
write
poetry
his
poems
were
love
poems
inspired
by
ruth
but
they
were
never
completed
not
in
a
day
could
he
learn
to
chant
in
noble
verse
rhyme
and
metre
and
structure
were
serious
enough
in
themselves
but
there
was
over
and
beyond
them
an
intangible
and
evasive
something
that
he
caught
in
all
great
poetry
but
which
he
could
not
catch
and
imprison
in
his
own
it
was
the
elusive
spirit
of
poetry
itself
that
he
sensed
and
sought
after
but
could
not
capture
it
seemed
a
glow
to
him
a
warm
and
trailing
vapor
ever
beyond
his
reaching
though
sometimes
he
was
rewarded
by
catching
at
shreds
of
it
and
weaving
them
into
phrases
that
echoed
in
his
brain
with
haunting
notes
or
drifted
across
his
vision
in
misty
wafture
of
unseen
beauty
it
was
baffling
he
ached
with
desire
to
express
and
could
but
gibber
prosaically
as
everybody
gibbered
he
read
his
fragments
aloud
the
metre
marched
along
on
perfect
feet
and
the
rhyme
pounded
a
longer
and
equally
faultless
rhythm
but
the
glow
and
high
exaltation
that
he
felt
within
were
lacking
he
could
not
understand
and
time
and
again
in
despair
defeated
and
depressed
he
returned
to
his
article
prose
was
certainly
an
easier
medium
following
the
he
wrote
an
article
on
the
sea
as
a
career
another
on
and
a
third
on
the
northeast
trades
then
he
tried
as
an
experiment
a
short
story
and
before
he
broke
his
stride
he
had
finished
six
short
stories
and
despatched
them
to
various
magazines
he
wrote
prolifically
intensely
from
morning
till
night
and
late
at
night
except
when
he
broke
off
to
go
to
the
draw
books
from
the
library
or
to
call
on
ruth
he
was
profoundly
happy
life
was
pitched
high
he
was
in
a
fever
that
never
broke
the
joy
of
creation
that
is
supposed
to
belong
to
the
gods
was
his
all
the
life
about
odors
of
stale
vegetables
and
soapsuds
the
slatternly
form
of
his
sister
and
the
jeering
face
of
a
dream
the
real
world
was
in
his
mind
and
the
stories
he
wrote
were
so
many
pieces
of
reality
out
of
his
mind
the
days
were
too
short
there
was
so
much
he
wanted
to
study
he
cut
his
sleep
down
to
five
hours
and
found
that
he
could
get
along
upon
it
he
tried
four
hours
and
a
half
and
regretfully
came
back
to
five
he
could
joyfully
have
spent
all
his
waking
hours
upon
any
one
of
his
pursuits
it
was
with
regret
that
he
ceased
from
writing
to
study
that
he
ceased
from
study
to
go
to
the
library
that
he
tore
himself
away
from
that
of
knowledge
or
from
the
magazines
in
the
that
were
filled
with
the
secrets
of
writers
who
succeeded
in
selling
their
wares
it
was
like
severing
heart
strings
when
he
was
with
ruth
to
stand
up
and
go
and
he
scorched
through
the
dark
streets
so
as
to
get
home
to
his
books
at
the
least
possible
expense
of
time
and
hardest
of
all
was
it
to
shut
up
the
algebra
or
physics
put
and
pencil
aside
and
close
his
tired
eyes
in
sleep
he
hated
the
thought
of
ceasing
to
live
even
for
so
short
a
time
and
his
sole
consolation
was
that
the
alarm
clock
was
set
five
hours
ahead
he
would
lose
only
five
hours
anyway
and
then
the
jangling
bell
would
jerk
him
out
of
unconsciousness
and
he
would
have
before
him
another
glorious
day
of
nineteen
hours
in
the
meantime
the
weeks
were
passing
his
money
was
ebbing
low
and
there
was
no
money
coming
in
a
month
after
he
had
mailed
it
the
adventure
serial
for
boys
was
returned
to
him
by
the
rejection
slip
was
so
tactfully
worded
that
he
felt
kindly
toward
the
editor
but
he
did
not
feel
so
kindly
toward
the
editor
of
the
francisco
after
waiting
two
whole
weeks
martin
had
written
to
him
a
week
later
he
wrote
again
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
went
over
to
san
francisco
and
personally
called
upon
the
editor
but
he
did
not
meet
that
exalted
personage
thanks
to
a
cerberus
of
an
office
boy
of
tender
years
and
red
hair
who
guarded
the
portals
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
week
the
manuscript
came
back
to
him
by
mail
without
comment
there
was
no
rejection
slip
no
explanation
nothing
in
the
same
way
his
other
articles
were
tied
up
with
the
other
leading
san
francisco
papers
when
he
recovered
them
he
sent
them
to
the
magazines
in
the
east
from
which
they
were
returned
more
promptly
accompanied
always
by
the
printed
rejection
slips
the
short
stories
were
returned
in
similar
fashion
he
read
them
over
and
over
and
liked
them
so
much
that
he
could
not
puzzle
out
the
cause
of
their
rejection
until
one
day
he
read
in
a
newspaper
that
manuscripts
should
always
be
typewritten
that
explained
it
of
course
editors
were
so
busy
that
they
could
not
afford
the
time
and
strain
of
reading
handwriting
martin
rented
a
typewriter
and
spent
a
day
mastering
the
machine
each
day
he
typed
what
he
composed
and
he
typed
his
earlier
manuscripts
as
fast
as
they
were
returned
him
he
was
surprised
when
the
typed
ones
began
to
come
back
his
jaw
seemed
to
become
squarer
his
chin
more
aggressive
and
he
bundled
the
manuscripts
off
to
new
editors
the
thought
came
to
him
that
he
was
not
a
good
judge
of
his
own
work
he
tried
it
out
on
gertrude
he
read
his
stories
aloud
to
her
her
eyes
glistened
and
she
looked
at
him
proudly
as
she
said
it
grand
you
those
sort
of
yes
he
demanded
impatiently
the
did
you
like
it
grand
was
the
reply
grand
thrilling
too
i
was
all
worked
he
could
see
that
her
mind
was
not
clear
the
perplexity
was
strong
in
her
face
so
he
waited
say
mart
after
a
long
pause
did
it
end
did
that
young
man
who
spoke
so
get
her
and
after
he
had
explained
the
end
which
he
thought
he
had
made
artistically
obvious
she
would
say
what
i
wanted
to
know
why
you
write
that
way
in
the
story
one
thing
he
learned
after
he
had
read
her
a
number
of
stories
namely
that
she
liked
happy
endings
story
was
perfectly
grand
she
announced
straightening
up
from
the
with
a
tired
sigh
and
wiping
the
sweat
from
her
forehead
with
a
red
steamy
hand
it
makes
me
sad
i
want
to
cry
there
is
too
many
sad
things
in
the
world
anyway
it
makes
me
happy
to
think
about
happy
things
now
if
married
her
mind
mart
she
queried
apprehensively
just
happen
to
feel
that
way
because
tired
i
guess
but
the
story
was
grand
just
the
same
perfectly
grand
where
are
you
to
sell
it
a
horse
of
another
color
he
laughed
if
you
sell
it
what
do
you
think
get
for
it
a
hundred
dollars
that
would
be
the
least
the
way
prices
i
do
hope
sell
it
money
eh
then
he
added
proudly
wrote
it
in
two
days
fifty
dollars
a
he
longed
to
read
his
stories
to
ruth
but
did
not
dare
he
would
wait
till
some
were
published
he
decided
then
she
would
understand
what
he
had
been
working
for
in
the
meantime
he
toiled
on
never
had
the
spirit
of
adventure
lured
him
more
strongly
than
on
this
amazing
exploration
of
the
realm
of
mind
he
bought
the
on
physics
and
chemistry
and
along
with
his
algebra
worked
out
problems
and
demonstrations
he
took
the
laboratory
proofs
on
faith
and
his
intense
power
of
vision
enabled
him
to
see
the
reactions
of
chemicals
more
understandingly
than
the
average
student
saw
them
in
the
laboratory
martin
wandered
on
through
the
heavy
pages
overwhelmed
by
the
clews
he
was
getting
to
the
nature
of
things
he
had
accepted
the
world
as
the
world
but
now
he
was
comprehending
the
organization
of
it
the
play
and
interplay
of
force
and
matter
spontaneous
explanations
of
old
matters
were
continually
arising
in
his
mind
levers
and
purchases
fascinated
him
and
his
mind
roved
backward
to
and
blocks
and
tackles
at
sea
the
theory
of
navigation
which
enabled
the
ships
to
travel
unerringly
their
courses
over
the
pathless
ocean
was
made
clear
to
him
the
mysteries
of
storm
and
rain
and
tide
were
revealed
and
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
made
him
wonder
whether
he
had
written
his
article
on
the
northeast
trade
too
soon
at
any
rate
he
knew
he
could
write
it
better
now
one
afternoon
he
went
out
with
arthur
to
the
university
of
california
and
with
bated
breath
and
a
feeling
of
religious
awe
went
through
the
laboratories
saw
demonstrations
and
listened
to
a
physics
professor
lecturing
to
his
classes
but
he
did
not
neglect
his
writing
a
stream
of
short
stories
flowed
from
his
pen
and
he
branched
out
into
the
easier
forms
of
kind
he
saw
printed
in
the
he
lost
his
head
and
wasted
two
weeks
on
a
tragedy
in
blank
verse
the
swift
rejection
of
which
by
half
a
dozen
magazines
dumfounded
him
then
he
discovered
henley
and
wrote
a
series
of
on
the
model
of
they
were
simple
poems
of
light
and
color
and
romance
and
adventure
lyrics
he
called
them
and
he
judged
them
to
be
the
best
work
he
had
yet
done
there
were
thirty
and
he
completed
them
in
a
month
doing
one
a
day
after
having
done
his
regular
work
on
fiction
which
work
was
the
equivalent
to
a
work
of
the
average
successful
writer
the
toil
meant
nothing
to
him
it
was
not
toil
he
was
finding
speech
and
all
the
beauty
and
wonder
that
had
been
pent
for
years
behind
his
inarticulate
lips
was
now
pouring
forth
in
a
wild
and
virile
flood
he
showed
the
to
no
one
not
even
to
the
editors
he
had
become
distrustful
of
editors
but
it
was
not
distrust
that
prevented
him
from
submitting
the
they
were
so
beautiful
to
him
that
he
was
impelled
to
save
them
to
share
with
ruth
in
some
glorious
time
when
he
would
dare
to
read
to
her
what
he
had
written
against
that
time
he
kept
them
with
him
reading
them
aloud
going
over
them
until
he
knew
them
by
heart
he
lived
every
moment
of
his
waking
hours
and
he
lived
in
his
sleep
his
subjective
mind
rioting
through
his
five
hours
of
surcease
and
combining
the
thoughts
and
events
of
the
day
into
grotesque
and
impossible
marvels
in
reality
he
never
rested
and
a
weaker
body
or
a
less
firmly
poised
brain
would
have
been
prostrated
in
a
general
his
late
afternoon
calls
on
ruth
were
rarer
now
for
june
was
approaching
when
she
would
take
her
degree
and
finish
with
the
university
bachelor
of
arts
he
thought
of
her
degree
it
seemed
she
fled
beyond
him
faster
than
he
could
pursue
one
afternoon
a
week
she
gave
to
him
and
arriving
late
he
usually
stayed
for
dinner
and
for
music
afterward
those
were
his
days
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
in
such
contrast
with
that
in
which
he
lived
and
the
mere
nearness
to
her
sent
him
forth
each
time
with
a
firmer
grip
on
his
resolve
to
climb
the
heights
in
spite
of
the
beauty
in
him
and
the
aching
desire
to
create
it
was
for
her
that
he
struggled
he
was
a
lover
first
and
always
all
other
things
he
subordinated
to
love
greater
than
his
adventure
in
the
world
of
thought
was
his
the
world
itself
was
not
so
amazing
because
of
the
atoms
and
molecules
that
composed
it
according
to
the
propulsions
of
irresistible
force
what
made
it
amazing
was
the
fact
that
ruth
lived
in
it
she
was
the
most
amazing
thing
he
had
ever
known
or
dreamed
or
guessed
but
he
was
oppressed
always
by
her
remoteness
she
was
so
far
from
him
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
approach
her
he
had
been
a
success
with
girls
and
women
in
his
own
class
but
he
had
never
loved
any
of
them
while
he
did
love
her
and
besides
she
was
not
merely
of
another
class
his
very
love
elevated
her
above
all
classes
she
was
a
being
apart
so
far
apart
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
draw
near
to
her
as
a
lover
should
draw
near
it
was
true
as
he
acquired
knowledge
and
language
that
he
was
drawing
nearer
talking
her
speech
discovering
ideas
and
delights
in
common
but
this
did
not
satisfy
his
yearning
his
imagination
had
made
her
holy
too
holy
too
spiritualized
to
have
any
kinship
with
him
in
the
flesh
it
was
his
own
love
that
thrust
her
from
him
and
made
her
seem
impossible
for
him
love
itself
denied
him
the
one
thing
that
it
desired
and
then
one
day
without
warning
the
gulf
between
them
was
bridged
for
a
moment
and
thereafter
though
the
gulf
remained
it
was
ever
narrower
they
had
been
eating
luscious
black
cherries
with
a
juice
of
the
color
of
dark
wine
and
later
as
she
read
aloud
to
him
from
princess
he
chanced
to
notice
the
stain
of
the
cherries
on
her
lips
for
the
moment
her
divinity
was
shattered
she
was
clay
after
all
mere
clay
subject
to
the
common
law
of
clay
as
his
clay
was
subject
or
clay
her
lips
were
flesh
like
his
and
cherries
dyed
them
as
cherries
dyed
his
and
if
so
with
her
lips
then
was
it
so
with
all
of
her
she
was
woman
all
woman
just
like
any
woman
it
came
upon
him
abruptly
it
was
a
revelation
that
stunned
him
it
was
as
if
he
had
seen
the
sun
fall
out
of
the
sky
or
had
seen
worshipped
purity
polluted
then
he
realized
the
significance
of
it
and
his
heart
began
pounding
and
challenging
him
to
play
the
lover
with
this
woman
who
was
not
a
spirit
from
other
worlds
but
a
mere
woman
with
lips
a
cherry
could
stain
he
trembled
at
the
audacity
of
his
thought
but
all
his
soul
was
singing
and
reason
in
a
triumphant
paean
assured
him
he
was
right
something
of
this
change
in
him
must
have
reached
her
for
she
paused
from
her
reading
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
his
eyes
dropped
from
her
blue
eyes
to
her
lips
and
the
sight
of
the
stain
maddened
him
his
arms
all
but
flashed
out
to
her
and
around
her
in
the
way
of
his
old
careless
life
she
seemed
to
lean
toward
him
to
wait
and
all
his
will
fought
to
hold
him
back
were
not
following
a
word
she
pouted
then
she
laughed
at
him
delighting
in
his
confusion
and
as
he
looked
into
her
frank
eyes
and
knew
that
she
had
divined
nothing
of
what
he
felt
he
became
abashed
he
had
indeed
in
thought
dared
too
far
of
all
the
women
he
had
known
there
was
no
woman
who
would
not
have
her
and
she
had
not
guessed
there
was
the
difference
she
was
different
he
was
appalled
by
his
own
grossness
awed
by
her
clear
innocence
and
he
gazed
again
at
her
across
the
gulf
the
bridge
had
broken
down
but
still
the
incident
had
brought
him
nearer
the
memory
of
it
persisted
and
in
the
moments
when
he
was
most
cast
down
he
dwelt
upon
it
eagerly
the
gulf
was
never
again
so
wide
he
had
accomplished
a
distance
vastly
greater
than
a
bachelorship
of
arts
or
a
dozen
bachelorships
she
was
pure
it
was
true
as
he
had
never
dreamed
of
purity
but
cherries
stained
her
lips
she
was
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
universe
just
as
inexorably
as
he
was
she
had
to
eat
to
live
and
when
she
got
her
feet
wet
she
caught
cold
but
that
was
not
the
point
if
she
could
feel
hunger
and
thirst
and
heat
and
cold
then
could
she
feel
love
for
a
man
well
he
was
a
man
and
why
could
he
not
be
the
man
up
to
me
to
make
good
he
would
murmur
fervently
will
be
man
i
will
make
myself
man
i
will
make
chapter
xii
early
one
evening
struggling
with
a
sonnet
that
twisted
all
awry
the
beauty
and
thought
that
trailed
in
glow
and
vapor
through
his
brain
martin
was
called
to
the
telephone
a
voice
a
fine
higginbotham
who
had
called
him
jeered
martin
went
to
the
telephone
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
felt
a
wave
of
warmth
rush
through
him
as
he
heard
voice
in
his
battle
with
the
sonnet
he
had
forgotten
her
existence
and
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
his
love
for
her
smote
him
like
a
sudden
blow
and
such
a
voice
and
sweet
like
a
strain
of
music
heard
far
off
and
faint
or
better
like
a
bell
of
silver
a
perfect
tone
no
mere
woman
had
a
voice
like
that
there
was
something
celestial
about
it
and
it
came
from
other
worlds
he
could
scarcely
hear
what
it
said
so
ravished
was
he
though
he
controlled
his
face
for
he
knew
that
ferret
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
it
was
not
much
that
ruth
wanted
to
that
norman
had
been
going
to
take
her
to
a
lecture
that
night
but
that
he
had
a
headache
and
she
was
so
disappointed
and
she
had
the
tickets
and
that
if
he
had
no
other
engagement
would
he
be
good
enough
to
take
her
would
he
he
fought
to
suppress
the
eagerness
in
his
voice
it
was
amazing
he
had
always
seen
her
in
her
own
house
and
he
had
never
dared
to
ask
her
to
go
anywhere
with
him
quite
irrelevantly
still
at
the
telephone
and
talking
with
her
he
felt
an
overpowering
desire
to
die
for
her
and
visions
of
heroic
sacrifice
shaped
and
dissolved
in
his
whirling
brain
he
loved
her
so
much
so
terribly
so
hopelessly
in
that
moment
of
mad
happiness
that
she
should
go
out
with
him
go
to
a
lecture
with
him
martin
soared
so
far
above
him
that
there
seemed
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
than
die
for
her
it
was
the
only
fit
way
in
which
he
could
express
the
tremendous
and
lofty
emotion
he
felt
for
her
it
was
the
sublime
abnegation
of
true
love
that
comes
to
all
lovers
and
it
came
to
him
there
at
the
telephone
in
a
whirlwind
of
fire
and
glory
and
to
die
for
her
he
felt
was
to
have
lived
and
loved
well
and
he
was
only
and
he
had
never
been
in
love
before
his
hand
trembled
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
he
was
weak
from
the
organ
which
had
stirred
him
his
eyes
were
shining
like
an
and
his
face
was
transfigured
purged
of
all
earthly
dross
and
pure
and
holy
dates
outside
eh
his
sneered
know
what
that
means
be
in
the
police
court
but
martin
could
not
come
down
from
the
height
not
even
the
bestiality
of
the
allusion
could
bring
him
back
to
earth
anger
and
hurt
were
beneath
him
he
had
seen
a
great
vision
and
was
as
a
god
and
he
could
feel
only
profound
and
awful
pity
for
this
maggot
of
a
man
he
did
not
look
at
him
and
though
his
eyes
passed
over
him
he
did
not
see
him
and
as
in
a
dream
he
passed
out
of
the
room
to
dress
it
was
not
until
he
had
reached
his
own
room
and
was
tying
his
necktie
that
he
became
aware
of
a
sound
that
lingered
unpleasantly
in
his
ears
on
investigating
this
sound
he
identified
it
as
the
final
snort
of
bernard
higginbotham
which
somehow
had
not
penetrated
to
his
brain
before
as
front
door
closed
behind
them
and
he
came
down
the
steps
with
her
he
found
himself
greatly
perturbed
it
was
not
unalloyed
bliss
taking
her
to
the
lecture
he
did
not
know
what
he
ought
to
do
he
had
seen
on
the
streets
with
persons
of
her
class
that
the
women
took
the
arms
but
then
again
he
had
seen
them
when
they
and
he
wondered
if
it
was
only
in
the
evening
that
arms
were
taken
or
only
between
husbands
and
wives
and
relatives
just
before
he
reached
the
sidewalk
he
remembered
minnie
minnie
had
always
been
a
stickler
she
had
called
him
down
the
second
time
she
walked
out
with
him
because
he
had
gone
along
on
the
inside
and
she
had
laid
the
law
down
to
him
that
a
gentleman
always
walked
on
the
he
was
with
a
lady
and
minnie
had
made
a
practice
of
kicking
his
heels
whenever
they
crossed
from
one
side
of
the
street
to
the
other
to
remind
him
to
get
over
on
the
outside
he
wondered
where
she
had
got
that
item
of
etiquette
and
whether
it
had
filtered
down
from
above
and
was
all
right
it
do
any
harm
to
try
it
he
decided
by
the
time
they
had
reached
the
sidewalk
and
he
swung
behind
ruth
and
took
up
his
station
on
the
outside
then
the
other
problem
presented
itself
should
he
offer
her
his
arm
he
had
never
offered
anybody
his
arm
in
his
life
the
girls
he
had
known
never
took
the
arms
for
the
first
several
times
they
walked
freely
side
by
side
and
after
that
it
was
arms
around
the
waists
and
heads
against
the
shoulders
where
the
streets
were
unlighted
but
this
was
different
she
that
kind
of
a
girl
he
must
do
something
he
crooked
the
arm
next
to
it
very
slightly
and
with
secret
tentativeness
not
invitingly
but
just
casually
as
though
he
was
accustomed
to
walk
that
way
and
then
the
wonderful
thing
happened
he
felt
her
hand
upon
his
arm
delicious
thrills
ran
through
him
at
the
contact
and
for
a
few
sweet
moments
it
seemed
that
he
had
left
the
solid
earth
and
was
flying
with
her
through
the
air
but
he
was
soon
back
again
perturbed
by
a
new
complication
they
were
crossing
the
street
this
would
put
him
on
the
inside
he
should
be
on
the
outside
should
he
therefore
drop
her
arm
and
change
over
and
if
he
did
so
would
he
have
to
repeat
the
manoeuvre
the
next
time
and
the
next
there
was
something
wrong
about
it
and
he
resolved
not
to
caper
about
and
play
the
fool
yet
he
was
not
satisfied
with
his
conclusion
and
when
he
found
himself
on
the
inside
he
talked
quickly
and
earnestly
making
a
show
of
being
carried
away
by
what
he
was
saying
so
that
in
case
he
was
wrong
in
not
changing
sides
his
enthusiasm
would
seem
the
cause
for
his
carelessness
as
they
crossed
broadway
he
came
face
to
face
with
a
new
problem
in
the
blaze
of
the
electric
lights
he
saw
lizzie
connolly
and
her
giggly
friend
only
for
an
instant
he
hesitated
then
his
hand
went
up
and
his
hat
came
off
he
could
not
be
disloyal
to
his
kind
and
it
was
to
more
than
lizzie
connolly
that
his
hat
was
lifted
she
nodded
and
looked
at
him
boldly
not
with
soft
and
gentle
eyes
like
but
with
eyes
that
were
handsome
and
hard
and
that
swept
on
past
him
to
ruth
and
itemized
her
face
and
dress
and
station
and
he
was
aware
that
ruth
looked
too
with
quick
eyes
that
were
timid
and
mild
as
a
but
which
saw
in
a
look
that
was
a
flutter
on
and
past
the
girl
in
her
cheap
finery
and
under
the
strange
hat
that
all
girls
were
wearing
just
then
a
pretty
girl
ruth
said
a
moment
later
martin
could
have
blessed
her
though
he
said
know
i
guess
all
a
matter
of
personal
taste
but
she
strike
me
as
being
particularly
there
one
woman
in
ten
thousand
with
features
as
regular
as
hers
they
are
splendid
her
face
is
as
as
a
cameo
and
her
eyes
are
you
think
so
martin
queried
absently
for
to
him
there
was
only
one
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
and
she
was
beside
him
her
hand
upon
his
arm
i
think
so
if
that
girl
had
proper
opportunity
to
dress
eden
and
if
she
were
taught
how
to
carry
herself
you
would
be
fairly
dazzled
by
her
and
so
would
all
would
have
to
be
taught
how
to
speak
he
commented
else
most
of
the
men
understand
her
sure
you
understand
a
quarter
of
what
she
said
if
she
just
spoke
you
are
as
bad
as
arthur
when
you
try
to
make
your
forget
how
i
talked
when
you
first
met
me
i
have
learned
a
new
language
since
then
before
that
time
i
talked
as
that
girl
talks
now
i
can
manage
to
make
myself
understood
sufficiently
in
your
language
to
explain
that
you
do
not
know
that
other
language
and
do
you
know
why
she
carries
herself
the
way
she
does
i
think
about
such
things
now
though
i
never
used
to
think
about
them
and
i
am
beginning
to
why
does
she
has
worked
long
hours
for
years
at
machines
when
body
is
young
it
is
very
pliable
and
hard
work
will
mould
it
like
putty
according
to
the
nature
of
the
work
i
can
tell
at
a
glance
the
trades
of
many
workingmen
i
meet
on
the
street
look
at
me
why
am
i
rolling
all
about
the
shop
because
of
the
years
i
put
in
on
the
sea
if
put
in
the
same
years
with
my
body
young
and
pliable
i
be
rolling
now
but
be
and
so
with
that
girl
you
noticed
that
her
eyes
were
what
i
might
call
hard
she
has
never
been
sheltered
she
has
had
to
take
care
of
herself
and
a
young
girl
take
care
of
herself
and
keep
her
eyes
soft
and
gentle
yours
for
think
you
are
right
ruth
said
in
a
low
voice
it
is
too
bad
she
is
such
a
pretty
he
looked
at
her
and
saw
her
eyes
luminous
with
pity
and
then
he
remembered
that
he
loved
her
and
was
lost
in
amazement
at
his
fortune
that
permitted
him
to
love
her
and
to
take
her
on
his
arm
to
a
lecture
who
are
you
martin
eden
he
demanded
of
himself
in
the
that
night
when
he
got
back
to
his
room
he
gazed
at
himself
long
and
curiously
who
are
you
what
are
you
where
do
you
belong
you
belong
by
rights
to
girls
like
lizzie
connolly
you
belong
with
the
legions
of
toil
with
all
that
is
low
and
vulgar
and
unbeautiful
you
belong
with
the
oxen
and
the
drudges
in
dirty
surroundings
among
smells
and
stenches
there
are
the
stale
vegetables
now
those
potatoes
are
rotting
smell
them
damn
you
smell
them
and
yet
you
dare
to
open
the
books
to
listen
to
beautiful
music
to
learn
to
love
beautiful
paintings
to
speak
good
english
to
think
thoughts
that
none
of
your
own
kind
thinks
to
tear
yourself
away
from
the
oxen
and
the
lizzie
connollys
and
to
love
a
pale
spirit
of
a
woman
who
is
a
million
miles
beyond
you
and
who
lives
in
the
stars
who
are
you
and
what
are
you
damn
you
and
are
you
going
to
make
good
he
shook
his
fist
at
himself
in
the
glass
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
to
dream
for
a
space
with
wide
eyes
then
he
got
out
and
algebra
and
lost
himself
in
quadratic
equations
while
the
hours
slipped
by
and
the
stars
dimmed
and
the
gray
of
dawn
flooded
against
his
window
chapter
xiii
it
was
the
knot
of
wordy
socialists
and
philosophers
that
held
forth
in
the
city
hall
park
on
warm
afternoons
that
was
responsible
for
the
great
discovery
once
or
twice
in
the
month
while
riding
through
the
park
on
his
way
to
the
library
martin
dismounted
from
his
wheel
and
listened
to
the
arguments
and
each
time
he
tore
himself
away
reluctantly
the
tone
of
discussion
was
much
lower
than
at
table
the
men
were
not
grave
and
dignified
they
lost
their
tempers
easily
and
called
one
another
names
while
oaths
and
obscene
allusions
were
frequent
on
their
lips
once
or
twice
he
had
seen
them
come
to
blows
and
yet
he
knew
not
why
there
seemed
something
vital
about
the
stuff
of
these
thoughts
their
logomachy
was
far
more
stimulating
to
his
intellect
than
the
reserved
and
quiet
dogmatism
of
morse
these
men
who
slaughtered
english
gesticulated
like
lunatics
and
fought
one
ideas
with
primitive
anger
seemed
somehow
to
be
more
alive
than
morse
and
his
crony
butler
martin
had
heard
herbert
spencer
quoted
several
times
in
the
park
but
one
afternoon
a
disciple
of
appeared
a
seedy
tramp
with
a
dirty
coat
buttoned
tightly
at
the
throat
to
conceal
the
absence
of
a
shirt
battle
royal
was
waged
amid
the
smoking
of
many
cigarettes
and
the
expectoration
of
much
wherein
the
tramp
successfully
held
his
own
even
when
a
socialist
workman
sneered
is
no
god
but
the
unknowable
and
herbert
spencer
is
his
martin
was
puzzled
as
to
what
the
discussion
was
about
but
when
he
rode
on
to
the
library
he
carried
with
him
a
interest
in
herbert
spencer
and
because
of
the
frequency
with
which
the
tramp
had
mentioned
principles
martin
drew
out
that
volume
so
the
great
discovery
began
once
before
he
had
tried
spencer
and
choosing
the
of
to
begin
with
he
had
failed
as
abjectly
as
he
had
failed
with
madam
blavatsky
there
had
been
no
understanding
the
book
and
he
had
returned
it
unread
but
this
night
after
algebra
and
physics
and
an
attempt
at
a
sonnet
he
got
into
bed
and
opened
morning
found
him
still
reading
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
sleep
nor
did
he
write
that
day
he
lay
on
the
bed
till
his
body
grew
tired
when
he
tried
the
hard
floor
reading
on
his
back
the
book
held
in
the
air
above
him
or
changing
from
side
to
side
he
slept
that
night
and
did
his
writing
next
morning
and
then
the
book
tempted
him
and
he
fell
reading
all
afternoon
oblivious
to
everything
and
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
that
was
the
afternoon
ruth
gave
to
him
his
first
consciousness
of
the
immediate
world
about
him
was
when
bernard
higginbotham
jerked
open
the
door
and
demanded
to
know
if
he
thought
they
were
running
a
restaurant
martin
eden
had
been
mastered
by
curiosity
all
his
days
he
wanted
to
know
and
it
was
this
desire
that
had
sent
him
adventuring
over
the
world
but
he
was
now
learning
from
spencer
that
he
never
had
known
and
that
he
never
could
have
known
had
he
continued
his
sailing
and
wandering
forever
he
had
merely
skimmed
over
the
surface
of
things
observing
detached
phenomena
accumulating
fragments
of
facts
making
superficial
little
all
and
everything
quite
unrelated
in
a
capricious
and
disorderly
world
of
whim
and
chance
the
mechanism
of
the
flight
of
birds
he
had
watched
and
reasoned
about
with
understanding
but
it
had
never
entered
his
head
to
try
to
explain
the
process
whereby
birds
as
organic
flying
mechanisms
had
been
developed
he
had
never
dreamed
there
was
such
a
process
that
birds
should
have
come
to
be
was
unguessed
they
always
had
been
they
just
happened
and
as
it
was
with
birds
so
had
it
been
with
everything
his
ignorant
and
unprepared
attempts
at
philosophy
had
been
fruitless
the
medieval
metaphysics
of
kant
had
given
him
the
key
to
nothing
and
had
served
the
sole
purpose
of
making
him
doubt
his
own
intellectual
powers
in
similar
manner
his
attempt
to
study
evolution
had
been
confined
to
a
hopelessly
technical
volume
by
romanes
he
had
understood
nothing
and
the
only
idea
he
had
gathered
was
that
evolution
was
a
theory
of
a
lot
of
little
men
possessed
of
huge
and
unintelligible
vocabularies
and
now
he
learned
that
evolution
was
no
mere
theory
but
an
accepted
process
of
development
that
scientists
no
longer
disagreed
about
it
their
only
differences
being
over
the
method
of
evolution
and
here
was
the
man
spencer
organizing
all
knowledge
for
him
reducing
everything
to
unity
elaborating
ultimate
realities
and
presenting
to
his
startled
gaze
a
universe
so
concrete
of
realization
that
it
was
like
the
model
of
a
ship
such
as
sailors
make
and
put
into
glass
bottles
there
was
no
caprice
no
chance
all
was
law
it
was
in
obedience
to
law
that
the
bird
flew
and
it
was
in
obedience
to
the
same
law
that
fermenting
slime
had
writhed
and
squirmed
and
put
out
legs
and
wings
and
become
a
bird
martin
had
ascended
from
pitch
to
pitch
of
intellectual
living
and
here
he
was
at
a
higher
pitch
than
ever
all
the
hidden
things
were
laying
their
secrets
bare
he
was
drunken
with
comprehension
at
night
asleep
he
lived
with
the
gods
in
colossal
nightmare
and
awake
in
the
day
he
went
around
like
a
somnambulist
with
absent
stare
gazing
upon
the
world
he
had
just
discovered
at
table
he
failed
to
hear
the
conversation
about
petty
and
ignoble
things
his
eager
mind
seeking
out
and
following
cause
and
effect
in
everything
before
him
in
the
meat
on
the
platter
he
saw
the
shining
sun
and
traced
its
energy
back
through
all
its
transformations
to
its
source
a
hundred
million
miles
away
or
traced
its
energy
ahead
to
the
moving
muscles
in
his
arms
that
enabled
him
to
cut
the
meat
and
to
the
brain
wherewith
he
willed
the
muscles
to
move
to
cut
the
meat
until
with
inward
gaze
he
saw
the
same
sun
shining
in
his
brain
he
was
entranced
by
illumination
and
did
not
hear
the
whispered
by
jim
nor
see
the
anxiety
on
his
face
nor
notice
the
rotary
motion
of
bernard
finger
whereby
he
imparted
the
suggestion
of
wheels
revolving
in
his
head
what
in
a
way
most
profoundly
impressed
martin
was
the
correlation
of
all
knowledge
he
had
been
curious
to
know
things
and
whatever
he
acquired
he
had
filed
away
in
separate
memory
compartments
in
his
brain
thus
on
the
subject
of
sailing
he
had
an
immense
store
on
the
subject
of
woman
he
had
a
fairly
large
store
but
these
two
subjects
had
been
unrelated
between
the
two
memory
compartments
there
had
been
no
connection
that
in
the
fabric
of
knowledge
there
should
be
any
connection
whatever
between
a
woman
with
hysterics
and
a
schooner
carrying
a
or
heaving
to
in
a
gale
would
have
struck
him
as
ridiculous
and
impossible
but
herbert
spencer
had
shown
him
not
only
that
it
was
not
ridiculous
but
that
it
was
impossible
for
there
to
be
no
connection
all
things
were
related
to
all
other
things
from
the
farthermost
star
in
the
wastes
of
space
to
the
myriads
of
atoms
in
the
grain
of
sand
under
foot
this
new
concept
was
a
perpetual
amazement
to
martin
and
he
found
himself
engaged
continually
in
tracing
the
relationship
between
all
things
under
the
sun
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
sun
he
drew
up
lists
of
the
most
incongruous
things
and
was
unhappy
until
he
succeeded
in
establishing
kinship
between
them
between
love
poetry
earthquake
fire
rattlesnakes
rainbows
precious
gems
monstrosities
sunsets
the
roaring
of
lions
illuminating
gas
cannibalism
beauty
murder
lovers
fulcrums
and
tobacco
thus
he
unified
the
universe
and
held
it
up
and
looked
at
it
or
wandered
through
its
byways
and
alleys
and
jungles
not
as
a
terrified
traveller
in
the
thick
of
mysteries
seeking
an
unknown
goal
but
observing
and
charting
and
becoming
familiar
with
all
there
was
to
know
and
the
more
he
knew
the
more
passionately
he
admired
the
universe
and
life
and
his
own
life
in
the
midst
of
it
all
fool
he
cried
at
his
image
in
the
wanted
to
write
and
you
tried
to
write
and
you
had
nothing
in
you
to
write
about
what
did
you
have
in
you
childish
notions
a
few
sentiments
a
lot
of
undigested
beauty
a
great
black
mass
of
ignorance
a
heart
filled
to
bursting
with
love
and
an
ambition
as
big
as
your
love
and
as
futile
as
your
ignorance
and
you
wanted
to
write
why
just
on
the
edge
of
beginning
to
get
something
in
you
to
write
about
you
wanted
to
create
beauty
but
how
could
you
when
you
knew
nothing
about
the
nature
of
beauty
you
wanted
to
write
about
life
when
you
knew
nothing
of
the
essential
characteristics
of
life
you
wanted
to
write
about
the
world
and
the
scheme
of
existence
when
the
world
was
a
chinese
puzzle
to
you
and
all
that
you
could
have
written
would
have
been
about
what
you
did
not
know
of
the
scheme
of
existence
but
cheer
up
martin
my
boy
write
yet
you
know
a
little
a
very
little
and
on
the
right
road
now
to
know
more
some
day
if
lucky
you
may
come
pretty
close
to
knowing
all
that
may
be
known
then
you
will
he
brought
his
great
discovery
to
ruth
sharing
with
her
all
his
joy
and
wonder
in
it
but
she
did
not
seem
to
be
so
enthusiastic
over
it
she
tacitly
accepted
it
and
in
a
way
seemed
aware
of
it
from
her
own
studies
it
did
not
stir
her
deeply
as
it
did
him
and
he
would
have
been
surprised
had
he
not
reasoned
it
out
that
it
was
not
new
and
fresh
to
her
as
it
was
to
him
arthur
and
norman
he
found
believed
in
evolution
and
had
read
spencer
though
it
did
not
seem
to
have
made
any
vital
impression
upon
them
while
the
young
fellow
with
the
glasses
and
the
mop
of
hair
will
olney
sneered
disagreeably
at
spencer
and
repeated
the
epigram
is
no
god
but
the
unknowable
and
herbert
spencer
is
his
but
martin
forgave
him
the
sneer
for
he
had
begun
to
discover
that
olney
was
not
in
love
with
ruth
later
he
was
dumfounded
to
learn
from
various
little
happenings
not
only
that
olney
did
not
care
for
ruth
but
that
he
had
a
positive
dislike
for
her
martin
could
not
understand
this
it
was
a
bit
of
phenomena
that
he
could
not
correlate
with
all
the
rest
of
the
phenomena
in
the
universe
but
nevertheless
he
felt
sorry
for
the
young
fellow
because
of
the
great
lack
in
his
nature
that
prevented
him
from
a
proper
appreciation
of
fineness
and
beauty
they
rode
out
into
the
hills
several
sundays
on
their
wheels
and
martin
had
ample
opportunity
to
observe
the
armed
truce
that
existed
between
ruth
and
olney
the
latter
chummed
with
norman
throwing
arthur
and
martin
into
company
with
ruth
for
which
martin
was
duly
grateful
those
sundays
were
great
days
for
martin
greatest
because
he
was
with
ruth
and
great
also
because
they
were
putting
him
more
on
a
par
with
the
young
men
of
her
class
in
spite
of
their
long
years
of
disciplined
education
he
was
finding
himself
their
intellectual
equal
and
the
hours
spent
with
them
in
conversation
was
so
much
practice
for
him
in
the
use
of
the
grammar
he
had
studied
so
hard
he
had
abandoned
the
etiquette
books
falling
back
upon
observation
to
show
him
the
right
things
to
do
except
when
carried
away
by
his
enthusiasm
he
was
always
on
guard
keenly
watchful
of
their
actions
and
learning
their
little
courtesies
and
refinements
of
conduct
the
fact
that
spencer
was
very
little
read
was
for
some
time
a
source
of
surprise
to
martin
spencer
said
the
man
at
the
desk
in
the
library
yes
a
great
but
the
man
did
not
seem
to
know
anything
of
the
content
of
that
great
mind
one
evening
at
dinner
when
butler
was
there
martin
turned
the
conversation
upon
spencer
morse
bitterly
arraigned
the
english
agnosticism
but
confessed
that
he
had
not
read
while
butler
stated
that
he
had
no
patience
with
spencer
had
never
read
a
line
of
him
and
had
managed
to
get
along
quite
well
without
him
doubts
arose
in
mind
and
had
he
been
less
strongly
individual
he
would
have
accepted
the
general
opinion
and
given
herbert
spencer
up
as
it
was
he
found
explanation
of
things
convincing
and
as
he
phrased
it
to
himself
to
give
up
spencer
would
be
equivalent
to
a
navigator
throwing
the
compass
and
chronometer
overboard
so
martin
went
on
into
a
thorough
study
of
evolution
mastering
more
and
more
the
subject
himself
and
being
convinced
by
the
corroborative
testimony
of
a
thousand
independent
writers
the
more
he
studied
the
more
vistas
he
caught
of
fields
of
knowledge
yet
unexplored
and
the
regret
that
days
were
only
hours
long
became
a
chronic
complaint
with
him
one
day
because
the
days
were
so
short
he
decided
to
give
up
algebra
and
geometry
trigonometry
he
had
not
even
attempted
then
he
cut
chemistry
from
his
retaining
only
physics
am
not
a
specialist
he
said
in
defence
to
ruth
am
i
going
to
try
to
be
a
specialist
there
are
too
many
special
fields
for
any
one
man
in
a
whole
lifetime
to
master
a
tithe
of
them
i
must
pursue
general
knowledge
when
i
need
the
work
of
specialists
i
shall
refer
to
their
that
is
not
like
having
the
knowledge
yourself
she
protested
it
is
unnecessary
to
have
it
we
profit
from
the
work
of
the
specialists
what
they
are
for
when
i
came
in
i
noticed
the
at
work
specialists
and
when
they
get
done
you
will
enjoy
clean
chimneys
without
knowing
anything
about
the
construction
of
i
am
she
looked
at
him
curiously
and
he
felt
a
reproach
in
her
gaze
and
manner
but
he
was
convinced
of
the
rightness
of
his
position
thinkers
on
general
subjects
the
greatest
minds
in
the
world
in
fact
rely
on
the
specialists
herbert
spencer
did
that
he
generalized
upon
the
findings
of
thousands
of
investigators
he
would
have
had
to
live
a
thousand
lives
in
order
to
do
it
all
himself
and
so
with
darwin
he
took
advantage
of
all
that
had
been
learned
by
the
florists
and
right
martin
olney
said
know
what
after
and
ruth
she
know
what
she
is
after
for
herself
yes
olney
rushed
on
heading
off
her
objection
know
you
call
it
general
culture
but
it
matter
what
you
study
if
you
want
general
culture
you
can
study
french
or
you
can
study
german
or
cut
them
both
out
and
study
esperanto
get
the
culture
tone
just
the
same
you
can
study
greek
or
latin
too
for
the
same
purpose
though
it
will
never
be
any
use
to
you
it
will
be
culture
though
why
ruth
studied
saxon
became
clever
in
it
was
two
years
ago
all
that
she
remembers
of
it
now
is
that
sweet
aprile
with
his
schowers
that
the
way
it
goes
given
you
the
culture
tone
just
the
same
he
laughed
again
heading
her
off
know
we
were
in
the
same
you
speak
of
culture
as
if
it
should
be
a
means
to
something
ruth
cried
out
her
eyes
were
flashing
and
in
her
cheeks
were
two
spots
of
color
is
the
end
in
that
is
not
what
martin
do
you
know
do
you
want
martin
olney
demanded
turning
squarely
upon
him
martin
felt
very
uncomfortable
and
looked
entreaty
at
ruth
what
do
you
want
ruth
asked
will
settle
of
course
i
want
culture
martin
faltered
love
beauty
and
culture
will
give
me
a
finer
and
keener
appreciation
of
she
nodded
her
head
and
looked
triumph
and
you
know
it
was
comment
after
career
not
culture
it
just
happens
that
culture
in
his
case
is
incidental
to
career
if
he
wanted
to
be
a
chemist
culture
would
be
unnecessary
martin
wants
to
write
but
afraid
to
say
so
because
it
will
put
you
in
the
why
does
martin
want
to
write
he
went
on
he
rolling
in
wealth
why
do
you
fill
your
head
with
saxon
and
general
culture
because
you
have
to
make
your
way
in
the
world
your
father
sees
to
that
he
buys
your
clothes
for
you
and
all
the
rest
what
rotten
good
is
our
education
yours
and
mine
and
and
soaked
in
general
culture
and
if
our
daddies
went
broke
be
falling
down
on
examinations
the
best
job
you
could
get
ruth
would
be
a
country
school
or
music
teacher
in
a
pray
what
would
you
do
she
asked
a
blessed
thing
i
could
earn
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
day
common
labor
and
i
might
get
in
as
instructor
in
cramming
say
might
mind
you
and
i
might
be
chucked
out
at
the
end
of
the
week
for
sheer
martin
followed
the
discussion
closely
and
while
he
was
convinced
that
olney
was
right
he
resented
the
rather
cavalier
treatment
he
accorded
ruth
a
new
conception
of
love
formed
in
his
mind
as
he
listened
reason
had
nothing
to
do
with
love
it
mattered
not
whether
the
woman
he
loved
reasoned
correctly
or
incorrectly
love
was
above
reason
if
it
just
happened
that
she
did
not
fully
appreciate
his
necessity
for
a
career
that
did
not
make
her
a
bit
less
lovable
she
was
all
lovable
and
what
she
thought
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
lovableness
that
he
replied
to
a
question
from
olney
that
broke
in
upon
his
train
of
thought
was
saying
that
i
hoped
you
be
fool
enough
to
tackle
latin
is
more
than
culture
ruth
broke
in
is
are
you
going
to
tackle
it
olney
persisted
martin
was
sore
beset
he
could
see
that
ruth
was
hanging
eagerly
upon
his
answer
am
afraid
i
have
time
he
said
finally
like
to
but
i
have
see
not
seeking
culture
olney
exulted
trying
to
get
somewhere
to
do
but
mental
training
mind
discipline
what
makes
disciplined
ruth
looked
expectantly
at
martin
as
if
waiting
for
him
to
change
his
judgment
know
the
players
have
to
train
before
the
big
game
and
that
is
what
latin
does
for
the
thinker
it
and
bosh
what
they
told
us
when
we
were
kids
but
there
is
one
thing
they
tell
us
then
they
let
us
find
it
out
for
ourselves
olney
paused
for
effect
then
added
what
they
tell
us
was
that
every
gentleman
should
have
studied
latin
but
that
no
gentleman
should
know
unfair
ruth
cried
knew
you
were
turning
the
conversation
just
in
order
to
get
off
clever
all
right
was
the
retort
fair
too
the
only
men
who
know
their
latin
are
the
apothecaries
the
lawyers
and
the
latin
professors
and
if
martin
wants
to
be
one
of
them
i
miss
my
guess
but
all
that
got
to
do
with
herbert
spencer
anyway
just
discovered
spencer
and
wild
over
him
why
because
spencer
is
taking
him
somewhere
spencer
take
me
anywhere
nor
you
we
got
anywhere
to
go
get
married
some
day
and
have
nothing
to
do
but
keep
track
of
the
lawyers
and
business
agents
who
will
take
care
of
the
money
my
going
to
leave
onley
got
up
to
go
but
turned
at
the
door
and
delivered
a
parting
shot
leave
martin
alone
ruth
he
knows
best
for
himself
look
at
what
done
already
he
makes
me
sick
sometimes
sick
and
ashamed
of
myself
he
knows
more
now
about
the
world
and
life
and
place
and
all
the
rest
than
arthur
or
norman
or
i
or
you
too
for
that
matter
and
in
spite
of
all
our
latin
and
french
and
saxon
and
ruth
is
my
teacher
martin
answered
chivalrously
is
responsible
for
what
little
i
have
olney
looked
at
ruth
and
his
expression
was
malicious
suppose
be
telling
me
next
that
you
read
spencer
on
her
you
and
she
know
anything
more
about
darwin
and
evolution
than
i
do
about
king
mines
that
jawbreaker
definition
about
something
or
other
of
that
you
sprang
on
us
the
other
indefinite
incoherent
homogeneity
thing
spring
it
on
her
and
see
if
she
understands
a
word
of
it
that
culture
you
see
well
tra
la
and
if
you
tackle
latin
martin
i
have
any
respect
for
and
all
the
while
interested
in
the
discussion
martin
had
been
aware
of
an
irk
in
it
as
well
it
was
about
studies
and
lessons
dealing
with
the
rudiments
of
knowledge
and
the
schoolboyish
tone
of
it
conflicted
with
the
big
things
that
were
stirring
in
the
grip
upon
life
that
was
even
then
crooking
his
fingers
like
talons
with
the
cosmic
thrills
that
made
him
ache
and
with
the
inchoate
consciousness
of
mastery
of
it
all
he
likened
himself
to
a
poet
wrecked
on
the
shores
of
a
strange
land
filled
with
power
of
beauty
stumbling
and
stammering
and
vainly
trying
to
sing
in
the
rough
barbaric
tongue
of
his
brethren
in
the
new
land
and
so
with
him
he
was
alive
painfully
alive
to
the
great
universal
things
and
yet
he
was
compelled
to
potter
and
grope
among
schoolboy
topics
and
debate
whether
or
not
he
should
study
latin
in
hell
has
latin
to
do
with
it
he
demanded
before
his
mirror
that
night
wish
dead
people
would
stay
dead
why
should
i
and
the
beauty
in
me
be
ruled
by
the
dead
beauty
is
alive
and
everlasting
languages
come
and
go
they
are
the
dust
of
the
and
his
next
thought
was
that
he
had
been
phrasing
his
ideas
very
well
and
he
went
to
bed
wondering
why
he
could
not
talk
in
similar
fashion
when
he
was
with
ruth
he
was
only
a
schoolboy
with
a
tongue
when
he
was
in
her
presence
me
time
he
said
aloud
give
me
time
time
time
was
his
unending
plaint
chapter
xiv
it
was
not
because
of
olney
but
in
spite
of
ruth
and
his
love
for
ruth
that
he
finally
decided
not
to
take
up
latin
his
money
meant
time
there
was
so
much
that
was
more
important
than
latin
so
many
studies
that
clamored
with
imperious
voices
and
he
must
write
he
must
earn
money
he
had
had
no
acceptances
twoscore
of
manuscripts
were
travelling
the
endless
round
of
the
magazines
how
did
the
others
do
it
he
spent
long
hours
in
the
free
going
over
what
others
had
written
studying
their
work
eagerly
and
critically
comparing
it
with
his
own
and
wondering
wondering
about
the
secret
trick
they
had
discovered
which
enabled
them
to
sell
their
work
he
was
amazed
at
the
immense
amount
of
printed
stuff
that
was
dead
no
light
no
life
no
color
was
shot
through
it
there
was
no
breath
of
life
in
it
and
yet
it
sold
at
two
cents
a
word
twenty
dollars
a
newspaper
clipping
had
said
so
he
was
puzzled
by
countless
short
stories
written
lightly
and
cleverly
he
confessed
but
without
vitality
or
reality
life
was
so
strange
and
wonderful
filled
with
an
immensity
of
problems
of
dreams
and
of
heroic
toils
and
yet
these
stories
dealt
only
with
the
commonplaces
of
life
he
felt
the
stress
and
strain
of
life
its
fevers
and
sweats
and
wild
this
was
the
stuff
to
write
about
he
wanted
to
glorify
the
leaders
of
forlorn
hopes
the
mad
lovers
the
giants
that
fought
under
stress
and
strain
amid
terror
and
tragedy
making
life
crackle
with
the
strength
of
their
endeavor
and
yet
the
magazine
short
stories
seemed
intent
on
glorifying
the
butlers
the
sordid
and
the
commonplace
little
love
affairs
of
commonplace
little
men
and
women
was
it
because
the
editors
of
the
magazines
were
commonplace
he
demanded
or
were
they
afraid
of
life
these
writers
and
editors
and
readers
but
his
chief
trouble
was
that
he
did
not
know
any
editors
or
writers
and
not
merely
did
he
not
know
any
writers
but
he
did
not
know
anybody
who
had
ever
attempted
to
write
there
was
nobody
to
tell
him
to
hint
to
him
to
give
him
the
least
word
of
advice
he
began
to
doubt
that
editors
were
real
men
they
seemed
cogs
in
a
machine
that
was
what
it
was
a
machine
he
poured
his
soul
into
stories
articles
and
poems
and
intrusted
them
to
the
machine
he
folded
them
just
so
put
the
proper
stamps
inside
the
long
envelope
along
with
the
manuscript
sealed
the
envelope
put
more
stamps
outside
and
dropped
it
into
the
it
travelled
across
the
continent
and
after
a
certain
lapse
of
time
the
postman
returned
him
the
manuscript
in
another
long
envelope
on
the
outside
of
which
were
the
stamps
he
had
enclosed
there
was
no
human
editor
at
the
other
end
but
a
mere
cunning
arrangement
of
cogs
that
changed
the
manuscript
from
one
envelope
to
another
and
stuck
on
the
stamps
it
was
like
the
slot
machines
wherein
one
dropped
pennies
and
with
a
metallic
whirl
of
machinery
had
delivered
to
him
a
stick
of
or
a
tablet
of
chocolate
it
depended
upon
which
slot
one
dropped
the
penny
in
whether
he
got
chocolate
or
gum
and
so
with
the
editorial
machine
one
slot
brought
checks
and
the
other
brought
rejection
slips
so
far
he
had
found
only
the
latter
slot
it
was
the
rejection
slips
that
completed
the
horrible
machinelikeness
of
the
process
these
slips
were
printed
in
stereotyped
forms
and
he
had
received
hundreds
of
many
as
a
dozen
or
more
on
each
of
his
earlier
manuscripts
if
he
had
received
one
line
one
personal
line
along
with
one
rejection
of
all
his
rejections
he
would
have
been
cheered
but
not
one
editor
had
given
that
proof
of
existence
and
he
could
conclude
only
that
there
were
no
warm
human
men
at
the
other
end
only
mere
cogs
well
oiled
and
running
beautifully
in
the
machine
he
was
a
good
fighter
and
stubborn
and
he
would
have
been
content
to
continue
feeding
the
machine
for
years
but
he
was
bleeding
to
death
and
not
years
but
weeks
would
determine
the
fight
each
week
his
board
bill
brought
him
nearer
destruction
while
the
postage
on
forty
manuscripts
bled
him
almost
as
severely
he
no
longer
bought
books
and
he
economized
in
petty
ways
and
sought
to
delay
the
inevitable
end
though
he
did
not
know
how
to
economize
and
brought
the
end
nearer
by
a
week
when
he
gave
his
sister
marian
five
dollars
for
a
dress
he
struggled
in
the
dark
without
advice
without
encouragement
and
in
the
teeth
of
discouragement
even
gertrude
was
beginning
to
look
askance
at
first
she
had
tolerated
with
sisterly
fondness
what
she
conceived
to
be
his
foolishness
but
now
out
of
sisterly
solicitude
she
grew
anxious
to
her
it
seemed
that
his
foolishness
was
becoming
a
madness
martin
knew
this
and
suffered
more
keenly
from
it
than
from
the
open
and
nagging
contempt
of
bernard
higginbotham
martin
had
faith
in
himself
but
he
was
alone
in
this
faith
not
even
ruth
had
faith
she
had
wanted
him
to
devote
himself
to
study
and
though
she
had
not
openly
disapproved
of
his
writing
she
had
never
approved
he
had
never
offered
to
show
her
his
work
a
fastidious
delicacy
had
prevented
him
besides
she
had
been
studying
heavily
at
the
university
and
he
felt
averse
to
robbing
her
of
her
time
but
when
she
had
taken
her
degree
she
asked
him
herself
to
let
her
see
something
of
what
he
had
been
doing
martin
was
elated
and
diffident
here
was
a
judge
she
was
a
bachelor
of
arts
she
had
studied
literature
under
skilled
instructors
perhaps
the
editors
were
capable
judges
too
but
she
would
be
different
from
them
she
would
not
hand
him
a
stereotyped
rejection
slip
nor
would
she
inform
him
that
lack
of
preference
for
his
work
did
not
necessarily
imply
lack
of
merit
in
his
work
she
would
talk
a
warm
human
being
in
her
quick
bright
way
and
most
important
of
all
she
would
catch
glimpses
of
the
real
martin
eden
in
his
work
she
would
discern
what
his
heart
and
soul
were
like
and
she
would
come
to
understand
something
a
little
something
of
the
stuff
of
his
dreams
and
the
strength
of
his
power
martin
gathered
together
a
number
of
carbon
copies
of
his
short
stories
hesitated
a
moment
then
added
his
they
mounted
their
wheels
on
a
late
june
afternoon
and
rode
for
the
hills
it
was
the
second
time
he
had
been
out
with
her
alone
and
as
they
rode
along
through
the
balmy
warmth
just
chilled
by
she
to
refreshing
coolness
he
was
profoundly
impressed
by
the
fact
that
it
was
a
very
beautiful
and
world
and
that
it
was
good
to
be
alive
and
to
love
they
left
their
wheels
by
the
roadside
and
climbed
to
the
brown
top
of
an
open
knoll
where
the
sunburnt
grass
breathed
a
harvest
breath
of
dry
sweetness
and
content
work
is
done
martin
said
as
they
seated
themselves
she
upon
his
coat
and
he
sprawling
close
to
the
warm
earth
he
sniffed
the
sweetness
of
the
tawny
grass
which
entered
his
brain
and
set
his
thoughts
whirling
on
from
the
particular
to
the
universal
has
achieved
its
reason
for
existence
he
went
on
patting
the
dry
grass
affectionately
quickened
with
ambition
under
the
dreary
downpour
of
last
winter
fought
the
violent
early
spring
flowered
and
lured
the
insects
and
the
bees
scattered
its
seeds
squared
itself
with
its
duty
and
the
world
do
you
always
look
at
things
with
such
dreadfully
practical
eyes
she
interrupted
been
studying
evolution
i
guess
only
recently
that
i
got
my
eyesight
if
the
truth
were
it
seems
to
me
you
lose
sight
of
beauty
by
being
so
practical
that
you
destroy
beauty
like
the
boys
who
catch
butterflies
and
rub
the
down
off
their
beautiful
he
shook
his
head
has
significance
but
i
never
knew
its
significance
before
i
just
accepted
beauty
as
something
meaningless
as
something
that
was
just
beautiful
without
rhyme
or
reason
i
did
not
know
anything
about
beauty
but
now
i
know
or
rather
am
just
beginning
to
know
this
grass
is
more
beautiful
to
me
now
that
i
know
why
it
is
grass
and
all
the
hidden
chemistry
of
sun
and
rain
and
earth
that
makes
it
become
grass
why
there
is
romance
in
the
of
any
grass
yes
and
adventure
too
the
very
thought
of
it
stirs
me
when
i
think
of
the
play
of
force
and
matter
and
all
the
tremendous
struggle
of
it
i
feel
as
if
i
could
write
an
epic
on
the
grass
well
you
talk
she
said
absently
and
he
noted
that
she
was
looking
at
him
in
a
searching
way
he
was
all
confusion
and
embarrassment
on
the
instant
the
blood
flushing
red
on
his
neck
and
brow
hope
i
am
learning
to
talk
he
stammered
seems
to
be
so
much
in
me
i
want
to
say
but
it
is
all
so
big
i
find
ways
to
say
what
is
really
in
me
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
all
the
world
all
life
everything
had
taken
up
residence
inside
of
me
and
was
clamoring
for
me
to
be
the
spokesman
i
i
describe
feel
the
bigness
of
it
but
when
i
speak
i
babble
like
a
little
child
it
is
a
great
task
to
transmute
feeling
and
sensation
into
speech
written
or
spoken
that
will
in
turn
in
him
who
reads
or
listens
transmute
itself
back
into
the
selfsame
feeling
and
sensation
it
is
a
lordly
task
see
i
bury
my
face
in
the
grass
and
the
breath
i
draw
in
through
my
nostrils
sets
me
quivering
with
a
thousand
thoughts
and
fancies
it
is
a
breath
of
the
universe
i
have
breathed
i
know
song
and
laughter
and
success
and
pain
and
struggle
and
death
and
i
see
visions
that
arise
in
my
brain
somehow
out
of
the
scent
of
the
grass
and
i
would
like
to
tell
them
to
you
to
the
world
but
how
can
i
my
tongue
is
tied
i
have
tried
by
the
spoken
word
just
now
to
describe
to
you
the
effect
on
me
of
the
scent
of
the
grass
but
i
have
not
succeeded
i
have
no
more
than
hinted
in
awkward
speech
my
words
seem
gibberish
to
me
and
yet
i
am
stifled
with
desire
to
tell
oh
he
threw
up
his
hands
with
a
despairing
is
impossible
it
is
not
understandable
it
is
incommunicable
you
do
talk
well
she
insisted
think
how
you
have
improved
in
the
short
time
i
have
known
you
butler
is
a
noted
public
speaker
he
is
always
asked
by
the
state
committee
to
go
out
on
stump
during
campaign
yet
you
talked
just
as
well
as
he
the
other
night
at
dinner
only
he
was
more
controlled
you
get
too
excited
but
you
will
get
over
that
with
practice
why
you
would
make
a
good
public
speaker
you
can
go
you
want
to
you
are
masterly
you
can
lead
men
i
am
sure
and
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
succeed
at
anything
you
set
your
hand
to
just
as
you
have
succeeded
with
grammar
you
would
make
a
good
lawyer
you
should
shine
in
politics
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
you
from
making
as
great
a
success
as
butler
has
made
and
minus
the
dyspepsia
she
added
with
a
smile
they
talked
on
she
in
her
gently
persistent
way
returning
always
to
the
need
of
thorough
grounding
in
education
and
to
the
advantages
of
latin
as
part
of
the
foundation
for
any
career
she
drew
her
ideal
of
the
successful
man
and
it
was
largely
in
her
image
with
a
few
unmistakable
lines
and
touches
of
color
from
the
image
of
butler
he
listened
eagerly
with
receptive
ears
lying
on
his
back
and
looking
up
and
joying
in
each
movement
of
her
lips
as
she
talked
but
his
brain
was
not
receptive
there
was
nothing
alluring
in
the
pictures
she
drew
and
he
was
aware
of
a
dull
pain
of
disappointment
and
of
a
sharper
ache
of
love
for
her
in
all
she
said
there
was
no
mention
of
his
writing
and
the
manuscripts
he
had
brought
to
read
lay
neglected
on
the
ground
at
last
in
a
pause
he
glanced
at
the
sun
measured
its
height
above
the
horizon
and
suggested
his
manuscripts
by
picking
them
up
had
forgotten
she
said
quickly
i
am
so
anxious
to
he
read
to
her
a
story
one
that
he
flattered
himself
was
among
his
very
best
he
called
it
wine
of
life
and
the
wine
of
it
that
had
stolen
into
his
brain
when
he
wrote
it
stole
into
his
brain
now
as
he
read
it
there
was
a
certain
magic
in
the
original
conception
and
he
had
adorned
it
with
more
magic
of
phrase
and
touch
all
the
old
fire
and
passion
with
which
he
had
written
it
were
reborn
in
him
and
he
was
swayed
and
swept
away
so
that
he
was
blind
and
deaf
to
the
faults
of
it
but
it
was
not
so
with
ruth
her
trained
ear
detected
the
weaknesses
and
exaggerations
the
overemphasis
of
the
tyro
and
she
was
instantly
aware
each
time
the
tripped
and
faltered
she
scarcely
noted
the
rhythm
otherwise
except
when
it
became
too
pompous
at
which
moments
she
was
disagreeably
impressed
with
its
amateurishness
that
was
her
final
judgment
on
the
story
as
a
though
she
did
not
tell
him
so
instead
when
he
had
done
she
pointed
out
the
minor
flaws
and
said
that
she
liked
the
story
but
he
was
disappointed
her
criticism
was
just
he
acknowledged
that
but
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
not
sharing
his
work
with
her
for
the
purpose
of
schoolroom
correction
the
details
did
not
matter
they
could
take
care
of
themselves
he
could
mend
them
he
could
learn
to
mend
them
out
of
life
he
had
captured
something
big
and
attempted
to
imprison
it
in
the
story
it
was
the
big
thing
out
of
life
he
had
read
to
her
not
and
semicolons
he
wanted
her
to
feel
with
him
this
big
thing
that
was
his
that
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
grappled
with
his
own
brain
and
placed
there
on
the
page
with
his
own
hands
in
printed
words
well
he
had
failed
was
his
secret
decision
perhaps
the
editors
were
right
he
had
felt
the
big
thing
but
he
had
failed
to
transmute
it
he
concealed
his
disappointment
and
joined
so
easily
with
her
in
her
criticism
that
she
did
not
realize
that
deep
down
in
him
was
running
a
strong
undercurrent
of
disagreement
next
thing
called
he
said
unfolding
the
manuscript
has
been
refused
by
four
or
five
magazines
now
but
still
i
think
it
is
good
in
fact
i
know
what
to
think
of
it
except
that
caught
something
there
maybe
it
affect
you
as
it
does
me
a
short
two
thousand
dreadful
she
cried
when
he
had
finished
is
horrible
unutterably
horrible
he
noted
her
pale
face
her
eyes
wide
and
tense
and
her
clenched
hands
with
secret
satisfaction
he
had
succeeded
he
had
communicated
the
stuff
of
fancy
and
feeling
from
out
of
his
brain
it
had
struck
home
no
matter
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
it
had
gripped
her
and
mastered
her
made
her
sit
there
and
listen
and
forget
details
is
life
he
said
life
is
not
always
beautiful
and
yet
perhaps
because
i
am
strangely
made
i
find
something
beautiful
there
it
seems
to
me
that
the
beauty
is
tenfold
enhanced
because
it
is
why
the
poor
she
broke
in
disconnectedly
then
she
left
the
revolt
of
her
thought
unexpressed
to
cry
out
it
is
degrading
it
is
not
nice
it
is
nasty
for
the
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
heart
stood
still
he
had
never
dreamed
it
he
had
not
meant
it
the
whole
sketch
stood
before
him
in
letters
of
fire
and
in
such
blaze
of
illumination
he
sought
vainly
for
nastiness
then
his
heart
began
to
beat
again
he
was
not
guilty
you
select
a
nice
subject
she
was
saying
know
there
are
nasty
things
in
the
world
but
that
is
no
she
talked
on
in
her
indignant
strain
but
he
was
not
following
her
he
was
smiling
to
himself
as
he
looked
up
into
her
virginal
face
so
innocent
so
penetratingly
innocent
that
its
purity
seemed
always
to
enter
into
him
driving
out
of
him
all
dross
and
bathing
him
in
some
ethereal
effulgence
that
was
as
cool
and
soft
and
velvety
as
starshine
know
there
are
nasty
things
in
the
he
cuddled
to
him
the
notion
of
her
knowing
and
chuckled
over
it
as
a
love
joke
the
next
moment
in
a
flashing
vision
of
multitudinous
detail
he
sighted
the
whole
sea
of
nastiness
that
he
had
known
and
voyaged
over
and
through
and
he
forgave
her
for
not
understanding
the
story
it
was
through
no
fault
of
hers
that
she
could
not
understand
he
thanked
god
that
she
had
been
born
and
sheltered
to
such
innocence
but
he
knew
life
its
foulness
as
well
as
its
fairness
its
greatness
in
spite
of
the
slime
that
infested
it
and
by
god
he
was
going
to
have
his
say
on
it
to
the
world
saints
in
could
they
be
anything
but
fair
and
pure
no
praise
to
them
but
saints
in
that
was
the
everlasting
wonder
that
was
what
made
life
worth
while
to
see
moral
grandeur
rising
out
of
cesspools
of
iniquity
to
rise
himself
and
first
glimpse
beauty
faint
and
far
through
eyes
to
see
out
of
weakness
and
frailty
and
viciousness
and
all
abysmal
brutishness
arising
strength
and
truth
and
high
spiritual
he
caught
a
stray
sequence
of
sentences
she
was
uttering
tone
of
it
all
is
low
and
there
is
so
much
that
is
high
take
he
was
impelled
to
suggest
hall
and
would
have
done
so
had
not
his
vision
gripped
him
again
and
left
him
staring
at
her
the
female
of
his
kind
who
out
of
the
primordial
ferment
creeping
and
crawling
up
the
vast
ladder
of
life
for
a
thousand
thousand
centuries
had
emerged
on
the
topmost
rung
having
become
one
ruth
pure
and
fair
and
divine
and
with
power
to
make
him
know
love
and
to
aspire
toward
purity
and
to
desire
to
taste
martin
eden
who
too
had
come
up
in
some
amazing
fashion
from
out
of
the
ruck
and
the
mire
and
the
countless
mistakes
and
abortions
of
unending
creation
there
was
the
romance
and
the
wonder
and
the
glory
there
was
the
stuff
to
write
if
he
could
only
find
speech
saints
in
heaven
were
only
saints
and
could
not
help
themselves
but
he
was
a
man
have
strength
he
could
hear
her
saying
it
is
untutored
a
bull
in
a
china
shop
he
suggested
and
won
a
smile
you
must
develop
discrimination
you
must
consult
taste
and
fineness
and
dare
too
much
he
muttered
she
smiled
approbation
and
settled
herself
to
listen
to
another
story
know
what
make
of
this
he
said
apologetically
a
funny
thing
afraid
i
got
beyond
my
depth
in
it
but
my
intentions
were
good
bother
about
the
little
features
of
it
just
see
if
you
catch
the
feel
of
the
big
thing
in
it
it
is
big
and
it
is
true
though
the
chance
is
large
that
i
have
failed
to
make
it
he
read
and
as
he
read
he
watched
her
at
last
he
had
reached
her
he
thought
she
sat
without
movement
her
eyes
steadfast
upon
him
scarcely
breathing
caught
up
and
out
of
herself
he
thought
by
the
witchery
of
the
thing
he
had
created
he
had
entitled
the
story
and
it
was
the
apotheosis
of
of
the
adventure
of
the
storybooks
but
of
real
adventure
the
savage
taskmaster
awful
of
punishment
and
awful
of
reward
faithless
and
whimsical
demanding
terrible
patience
and
heartbreaking
days
and
nights
of
toil
offering
the
blazing
sunlight
glory
or
dark
death
at
the
end
of
thirst
and
famine
or
of
the
long
drag
and
monstrous
delirium
of
rotting
fever
through
blood
and
sweat
and
stinging
insects
leading
up
by
long
chains
of
petty
and
ignoble
contacts
to
royal
culminations
and
lordly
achievements
it
was
this
all
of
it
and
more
that
he
had
put
into
his
story
and
it
was
this
he
believed
that
warmed
her
as
she
sat
and
listened
her
eyes
were
wide
color
was
in
her
pale
cheeks
and
before
he
finished
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
almost
panting
truly
she
was
warmed
but
she
was
warmed
not
by
the
story
but
by
him
she
did
not
think
much
of
the
story
it
was
intensity
of
power
the
old
excess
of
strength
that
seemed
to
pour
from
his
body
and
on
and
over
her
the
paradox
of
it
was
that
it
was
the
story
itself
that
was
freighted
with
his
power
that
was
the
channel
for
the
time
being
through
which
his
strength
poured
out
to
her
she
was
aware
only
of
the
strength
and
not
of
the
medium
and
when
she
seemed
most
carried
away
by
what
he
had
written
in
reality
she
had
been
carried
away
by
something
quite
foreign
to
a
thought
terrible
and
perilous
that
had
formed
itself
unsummoned
in
her
brain
she
had
caught
herself
wondering
what
marriage
was
like
and
the
becoming
conscious
of
the
waywardness
and
ardor
of
the
thought
had
terrified
her
it
was
unmaidenly
it
was
not
like
her
she
had
never
been
tormented
by
womanhood
and
she
had
lived
in
a
dreamland
of
tennysonian
poesy
dense
even
to
the
full
significance
of
that
delicate
delicate
allusions
to
the
grossnesses
that
intrude
upon
the
relations
of
queens
and
knights
she
had
been
asleep
always
and
now
life
was
thundering
imperatively
at
all
her
doors
mentally
she
was
in
a
panic
to
shoot
the
bolts
and
drop
the
bars
into
place
while
wanton
instincts
urged
her
to
throw
wide
her
portals
and
bid
the
deliciously
strange
visitor
to
enter
in
martin
waited
with
satisfaction
for
her
verdict
he
had
no
doubt
of
what
it
would
be
and
he
was
astounded
when
he
heard
her
say
is
is
beautiful
she
repeated
with
emphasis
after
a
pause
of
course
it
was
beautiful
but
there
was
something
more
than
mere
beauty
in
it
something
more
stingingly
splendid
which
had
made
beauty
its
handmaiden
he
sprawled
silently
on
the
ground
watching
the
grisly
form
of
a
great
doubt
rising
before
him
he
had
failed
he
was
inarticulate
he
had
seen
one
of
the
greatest
things
in
the
world
and
he
had
not
expressed
it
did
you
think
of
he
hesitated
abashed
at
his
first
attempt
to
use
a
strange
word
the
he
asked
was
confused
she
answered
is
my
only
criticism
in
the
large
way
i
followed
the
story
but
there
seemed
so
much
else
it
is
too
wordy
you
clog
the
action
by
introducing
so
much
extraneous
was
the
major
he
hurriedly
explained
big
underrunning
the
cosmic
and
universal
thing
i
tried
to
make
it
keep
time
with
the
story
itself
which
was
only
superficial
after
all
i
was
on
the
right
scent
but
i
guess
i
did
it
badly
i
did
not
succeed
in
suggesting
what
i
was
driving
at
but
learn
in
she
did
not
follow
him
she
was
a
bachelor
of
arts
but
he
had
gone
beyond
her
limitations
this
she
did
not
comprehend
attributing
her
incomprehension
to
his
incoherence
were
too
voluble
she
said
it
was
beautiful
in
he
heard
her
voice
as
from
far
off
for
he
was
debating
whether
he
would
read
her
the
he
lay
in
dull
despair
while
she
watched
him
searchingly
pondering
again
upon
unsummoned
and
wayward
thoughts
of
marriage
want
to
be
famous
she
asked
abruptly
a
little
bit
he
confessed
is
part
of
the
adventure
it
is
not
the
being
famous
but
the
process
of
becoming
so
that
counts
and
after
all
to
be
famous
would
be
for
me
only
a
means
to
something
else
i
want
to
be
famous
very
much
for
that
matter
and
for
that
your
sake
he
wanted
to
add
and
might
have
added
had
she
proved
enthusiastic
over
what
he
had
read
to
her
but
she
was
too
busy
in
her
mind
carving
out
a
career
for
him
that
would
at
least
be
possible
to
ask
what
the
ultimate
something
was
which
he
had
hinted
at
there
was
no
career
for
him
in
literature
of
that
she
was
convinced
he
had
proved
it
with
his
amateurish
and
sophomoric
productions
he
could
talk
well
but
he
was
incapable
of
expressing
himself
in
a
literary
way
she
compared
tennyson
and
browning
and
her
favorite
prose
masters
with
him
and
to
his
hopeless
discredit
yet
she
did
not
tell
him
her
whole
mind
her
strange
interest
in
him
led
her
to
temporize
his
desire
to
write
was
after
all
a
little
weakness
which
he
would
grow
out
of
in
time
then
he
would
devote
himself
to
the
more
serious
affairs
of
life
and
he
would
succeed
too
she
knew
that
he
was
so
strong
that
he
could
not
only
he
would
drop
writing
wish
you
would
show
me
all
you
write
eden
she
said
he
flushed
with
pleasure
she
was
interested
that
much
was
sure
and
at
least
she
had
not
given
him
a
rejection
slip
she
had
called
certain
portions
of
his
work
beautiful
and
that
was
the
first
encouragement
he
had
ever
received
from
any
one
will
he
said
passionately
i
promise
you
miss
morse
that
i
will
make
good
i
have
come
far
i
know
that
and
i
have
far
to
go
and
i
will
cover
it
if
i
have
to
do
it
on
my
hands
and
he
held
up
a
bunch
of
manuscript
are
the
when
you
get
home
turn
them
over
to
you
to
read
at
your
leisure
and
you
must
be
sure
to
tell
me
just
what
you
think
of
them
what
i
need
you
know
above
all
things
is
criticism
and
do
please
be
frank
with
will
be
perfectly
frank
she
promised
with
an
uneasy
conviction
that
she
had
not
been
frank
with
him
and
with
a
doubt
if
she
could
be
quite
frank
with
him
the
next
time
chapter
xv
first
battle
fought
and
finished
martin
said
to
the
ten
days
later
there
will
be
a
second
battle
and
a
third
battle
and
battles
to
the
end
of
time
he
had
not
finished
the
sentence
but
looked
about
the
mean
little
room
and
let
his
eyes
dwell
sadly
upon
a
heap
of
returned
manuscripts
still
in
their
long
envelopes
which
lay
in
a
corner
on
the
floor
he
had
no
stamps
with
which
to
continue
them
on
their
travels
and
for
a
week
they
had
been
piling
up
more
of
them
would
come
in
on
the
morrow
and
on
the
next
day
and
the
next
till
they
were
all
in
and
he
would
be
unable
to
start
them
out
again
he
was
a
rent
behind
on
the
typewriter
which
he
could
not
pay
having
barely
enough
for
the
board
which
was
due
and
for
the
employment
office
fees
he
sat
down
and
regarded
the
table
thoughtfully
there
were
ink
stains
upon
it
and
he
suddenly
discovered
that
he
was
fond
of
it
old
table
he
said
spent
some
happy
hours
with
you
and
been
a
pretty
good
friend
when
all
is
said
and
done
you
never
turned
me
down
never
passed
me
out
a
rejection
slip
never
complained
about
working
he
dropped
his
arms
upon
the
table
and
buried
his
face
in
them
his
throat
was
aching
and
he
wanted
to
cry
it
reminded
him
of
his
first
fight
when
he
was
six
years
old
when
he
punched
away
with
the
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
while
the
other
boy
two
years
his
elder
had
beaten
and
pounded
him
into
exhaustion
he
saw
the
ring
of
boys
howling
like
barbarians
as
he
went
down
at
last
writhing
in
the
throes
of
nausea
the
blood
streaming
from
his
nose
and
the
tears
from
his
bruised
eyes
little
shaver
he
murmured
just
as
badly
licked
now
beaten
to
a
pulp
down
and
but
the
vision
of
that
first
fight
still
lingered
under
his
eyelids
and
as
he
watched
he
saw
it
dissolve
and
reshape
into
the
series
of
fights
which
had
followed
six
months
later
that
was
the
boy
had
whipped
him
again
but
he
had
blacked
eye
that
time
that
was
going
some
he
saw
them
all
fight
after
fight
himself
always
whipped
and
exulting
over
him
but
he
had
never
run
away
he
felt
strengthened
by
the
memory
of
that
he
had
always
stayed
and
taken
his
medicine
had
been
a
little
fiend
at
fighting
and
had
never
once
shown
mercy
to
him
but
he
had
stayed
he
had
stayed
with
it
next
he
saw
a
narrow
alley
between
ramshackle
frame
buildings
the
end
of
the
alley
was
blocked
by
a
brick
building
out
of
which
issued
the
rhythmic
thunder
of
the
presses
running
off
the
first
edition
of
the
he
was
eleven
and
was
thirteen
and
they
both
carried
the
that
was
why
they
were
there
waiting
for
their
papers
and
of
course
had
picked
on
him
again
and
there
was
another
fight
that
was
indeterminate
because
at
quarter
to
four
the
door
of
the
was
thrown
open
and
the
gang
of
boys
crowded
in
to
fold
their
papers
lick
you
he
heard
promise
and
he
heard
his
own
voice
piping
and
trembling
with
unshed
tears
agreeing
to
be
there
on
the
morrow
and
he
had
come
there
the
next
day
hurrying
from
school
to
be
there
first
and
beating
by
two
minutes
the
other
boys
said
he
was
all
right
and
gave
him
advice
pointing
out
his
faults
as
a
scrapper
and
promising
him
victory
if
he
carried
out
their
instructions
the
same
boys
gave
advice
too
how
they
had
enjoyed
the
fight
he
paused
in
his
recollections
long
enough
to
envy
them
the
spectacle
he
and
had
put
up
then
the
fight
was
on
and
it
went
on
without
rounds
for
thirty
minutes
until
the
door
was
opened
he
watched
the
youthful
apparition
of
himself
day
after
day
hurrying
from
school
to
the
alley
he
could
not
walk
very
fast
he
was
stiff
and
lame
from
the
incessant
fighting
his
forearms
were
black
and
blue
from
wrist
to
elbow
what
of
the
countless
blows
he
had
warded
off
and
here
and
there
the
tortured
flesh
was
beginning
to
fester
his
head
and
arms
and
shoulders
ached
the
small
of
his
back
ached
ached
all
over
and
his
brain
was
heavy
and
dazed
he
did
not
play
at
school
nor
did
he
study
even
to
sit
still
all
day
at
his
desk
as
he
did
was
a
torment
it
seemed
centuries
since
he
had
begun
the
round
of
daily
fights
and
time
stretched
away
into
a
nightmare
and
infinite
future
of
daily
fights
why
be
licked
he
often
thought
that
would
put
him
martin
out
of
his
misery
it
never
entered
his
head
to
cease
fighting
to
allow
to
whip
him
and
so
he
dragged
himself
to
the
alley
sick
in
body
and
soul
but
learning
the
long
patience
to
confront
his
eternal
enemy
who
was
just
as
sick
as
he
and
just
a
bit
willing
to
quit
if
it
were
not
for
the
gang
of
newsboys
that
looked
on
and
made
pride
painful
and
necessary
one
afternoon
after
twenty
minutes
of
desperate
efforts
to
annihilate
each
other
according
to
set
rules
that
did
not
permit
kicking
striking
below
the
belt
nor
hitting
when
one
was
down
panting
for
breath
and
reeling
offered
to
call
it
quits
and
martin
head
on
arms
thrilled
at
the
picture
he
caught
of
himself
at
that
moment
in
the
afternoon
of
long
ago
when
he
reeled
and
panted
and
choked
with
the
blood
that
ran
into
his
mouth
and
down
his
throat
from
his
cut
lips
when
he
tottered
toward
spitting
out
a
mouthful
of
blood
so
that
he
could
speak
crying
out
that
he
would
never
quit
though
could
give
in
if
he
wanted
to
and
did
not
give
in
and
the
fight
went
on
the
next
day
and
the
next
days
without
end
witnessed
the
afternoon
fight
when
he
put
up
his
arms
each
day
to
begin
they
pained
exquisitely
and
the
first
few
blows
struck
and
received
racked
his
soul
after
that
things
grew
numb
and
he
fought
on
blindly
seeing
as
in
a
dream
dancing
and
wavering
the
large
features
and
burning
eyes
of
he
concentrated
upon
that
face
all
else
about
him
was
a
whirling
void
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
world
but
that
face
and
he
would
never
know
rest
blessed
rest
until
he
had
beaten
that
face
into
a
pulp
with
his
bleeding
knuckles
or
until
the
bleeding
knuckles
that
somehow
belonged
to
that
face
had
beaten
him
into
a
pulp
and
then
one
way
or
the
other
he
would
have
rest
but
to
quit
him
martin
to
quit
was
impossible
came
the
day
when
he
dragged
himself
into
the
alley
and
there
was
no
nor
did
come
the
boys
congratulated
him
and
told
him
that
he
had
licked
but
martin
was
not
satisfied
he
had
not
licked
nor
had
licked
him
the
problem
had
not
been
solved
it
was
not
until
afterward
that
they
learned
that
father
had
died
suddenly
that
very
day
martin
skipped
on
through
the
years
to
the
night
in
the
nigger
heaven
at
the
auditorium
he
was
seventeen
and
just
back
from
sea
a
row
started
somebody
was
bullying
somebody
and
martin
interfered
to
be
confronted
by
blazing
eyes
fix
you
after
de
show
his
ancient
enemy
hissed
martin
nodded
the
bouncer
was
making
his
way
toward
the
disturbance
meet
you
outside
after
the
last
act
martin
whispered
the
while
his
face
showed
undivided
interest
in
the
dancing
on
the
stage
the
bouncer
glared
and
went
away
a
gang
he
asked
at
the
end
of
the
act
i
got
to
get
one
martin
announced
between
the
acts
he
mustered
his
fellows
he
knew
from
the
nail
works
a
railroad
fireman
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
boo
gang
along
with
as
many
more
from
the
dread
gang
when
the
theatre
let
out
the
two
gangs
strung
along
inconspicuously
on
opposite
sides
of
the
street
when
they
came
to
a
quiet
corner
they
united
and
held
a
council
of
war
street
bridge
is
the
place
said
a
fellow
belonging
to
gang
kin
fight
in
the
middle
under
the
electric
light
whichever
way
the
bulls
come
in
we
kin
sneak
the
other
agreeable
to
me
martin
said
after
consulting
with
the
leaders
of
his
own
gang
the
eighth
street
bridge
crossing
an
arm
of
san
antonio
estuary
was
the
length
of
three
city
blocks
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
and
at
each
end
were
electric
lights
no
policeman
could
pass
those
unseen
it
was
the
safe
place
for
the
battle
that
revived
itself
under
eyelids
he
saw
the
two
gangs
aggressive
and
sullen
rigidly
keeping
apart
from
each
other
and
backing
their
respective
champions
and
he
saw
himself
and
stripping
a
short
distance
away
lookouts
were
set
their
task
being
to
watch
the
lighted
ends
of
the
bridge
a
member
of
the
boo
gang
held
coat
and
shirt
and
cap
ready
to
race
with
them
into
safety
in
case
the
police
interfered
martin
watched
himself
go
into
the
centre
facing
and
he
heard
himself
say
as
he
held
up
his
hand
warningly
no
in
this
understand
they
but
scrap
no
up
the
sponge
this
is
a
to
a
finish
understand
to
get
wanted
to
demur
could
see
that
old
perilous
pride
was
touched
before
the
two
gangs
come
on
he
replied
the
good
of
de
rag
about
it
cheh
to
de
then
they
fell
upon
each
other
like
young
bulls
in
all
the
glory
of
youth
with
naked
fists
with
hatred
with
desire
to
hurt
to
maim
to
destroy
all
the
painful
thousand
gains
of
man
in
his
upward
climb
through
creation
were
lost
only
the
electric
light
remained
a
milestone
on
the
path
of
the
great
human
adventure
martin
and
were
two
savages
of
the
stone
age
of
the
squatting
place
and
the
tree
refuge
they
sank
lower
and
lower
into
the
muddy
abyss
back
into
the
dregs
of
the
raw
beginnings
of
life
striving
blindly
and
chemically
as
atoms
strive
as
the
of
the
heavens
strives
colliding
recoiling
and
colliding
again
and
eternally
again
we
are
animals
martin
muttered
aloud
as
he
watched
the
progress
of
the
fight
it
was
to
him
with
his
splendid
power
of
vision
like
gazing
into
a
kinetoscope
he
was
both
onlooker
and
participant
his
long
months
of
culture
and
refinement
shuddered
at
the
sight
then
the
present
was
blotted
out
of
his
consciousness
and
the
ghosts
of
the
past
possessed
him
and
he
was
martin
eden
just
returned
from
sea
and
fighting
on
the
eighth
street
bridge
he
suffered
and
toiled
and
sweated
and
bled
and
exulted
when
his
naked
knuckles
smashed
home
they
were
twin
whirlwinds
of
hatred
revolving
about
each
other
monstrously
the
time
passed
and
the
two
hostile
gangs
became
very
quiet
they
had
never
witnessed
such
intensity
of
ferocity
and
they
were
awed
by
it
the
two
fighters
were
greater
brutes
than
they
the
first
splendid
velvet
edge
of
youth
and
condition
wore
off
and
they
fought
more
cautiously
and
deliberately
there
had
been
no
advantage
gained
either
way
fight
martin
heard
some
one
saying
then
he
followed
up
a
feint
right
and
left
was
fiercely
countered
and
felt
his
cheek
laid
open
to
the
bone
no
bare
knuckle
had
done
that
he
heard
mutters
of
amazement
at
the
ghastly
damage
wrought
and
was
drenched
with
his
own
blood
but
he
gave
no
sign
he
became
immensely
wary
for
he
was
wise
with
knowledge
of
the
low
cunning
and
foul
vileness
of
his
kind
he
watched
and
waited
until
he
feigned
a
wild
rush
which
he
stopped
midway
for
he
had
seen
the
glint
of
metal
up
yer
hand
he
screamed
brass
knuckles
you
hit
me
with
both
gangs
surged
forward
growling
and
snarling
in
a
second
there
would
be
a
fight
and
he
would
be
robbed
of
his
vengeance
he
was
beside
himself
guys
keep
out
he
screamed
hoarsely
say
understand
they
shrank
away
from
him
they
were
brutes
but
he
was
the
a
thing
of
terror
that
towered
over
them
and
dominated
them
is
my
scrap
they
to
be
no
in
gim
me
them
sobered
and
a
bit
frightened
surrendered
the
foul
weapon
passed
to
him
you
in
behind
the
push
there
martin
went
on
as
he
tossed
the
knuckles
into
the
water
seen
you
i
was
what
you
was
up
to
if
you
try
anything
like
that
again
beat
cheh
to
death
understand
they
fought
on
through
exhaustion
and
beyond
to
exhaustion
immeasurable
and
inconceivable
until
the
crowd
of
brutes
its
sated
terrified
by
what
it
saw
begged
them
impartially
to
cease
and
ready
to
drop
and
die
or
to
stay
on
his
legs
and
die
a
grisly
monster
out
of
whose
features
all
likeness
to
had
been
beaten
wavered
and
hesitated
but
martin
sprang
in
and
smashed
him
again
and
again
next
after
a
seeming
century
or
so
with
weakening
fast
in
a
of
blows
there
was
a
loud
snap
and
right
arm
dropped
to
his
side
it
was
a
broken
bone
everybody
heard
it
and
knew
and
knew
rushing
like
a
tiger
in
the
extremity
and
raining
blow
on
blow
gang
surged
forward
to
interfere
dazed
by
the
rapid
succession
of
blows
martin
warned
them
back
with
vile
and
earnest
curses
sobbed
out
and
groaned
in
ultimate
desolation
and
despair
he
punched
on
with
his
left
hand
only
and
as
he
punched
doggedly
only
as
from
a
remote
distance
he
heard
murmurs
of
fear
in
the
gangs
and
one
who
said
with
shaking
voice
a
scrap
fellows
murder
we
ought
to
stop
but
no
one
stopped
it
and
he
was
glad
punching
on
wearily
and
endlessly
with
his
one
arm
battering
away
at
a
bloody
something
before
him
that
was
not
a
face
but
a
horror
an
oscillating
hideous
gibbering
nameless
thing
that
persisted
before
his
wavering
vision
and
would
not
go
away
and
he
punched
on
and
on
slower
and
slower
as
the
last
shreds
of
vitality
oozed
from
him
through
centuries
and
aeons
and
enormous
lapses
of
time
until
in
a
dim
way
he
became
aware
that
the
nameless
thing
was
sinking
slowly
sinking
down
to
the
rough
of
the
bridge
and
the
next
moment
he
was
standing
over
it
staggering
and
swaying
on
shaky
legs
clutching
at
the
air
for
support
and
saying
in
a
voice
he
did
not
recognize
want
any
more
say
want
any
more
he
was
still
saying
it
over
and
over
entreating
threatening
to
know
if
it
wanted
any
more
he
felt
the
fellows
of
his
gang
laying
hands
on
him
patting
him
on
the
back
and
trying
to
put
his
coat
on
him
and
then
came
a
sudden
rush
of
blackness
and
oblivion
the
tin
on
the
table
ticked
on
but
martin
eden
his
face
buried
on
his
arms
did
not
hear
it
he
heard
nothing
he
did
not
think
so
absolutely
had
he
relived
life
that
he
had
fainted
just
as
he
fainted
years
before
on
the
eighth
street
bridge
for
a
full
minute
the
blackness
and
the
blankness
endured
then
like
one
from
the
dead
he
sprang
upright
eyes
flaming
sweat
pouring
down
his
face
shouting
licked
you
it
took
me
eleven
years
but
i
licked
you
his
knees
were
trembling
under
him
he
felt
faint
and
he
staggered
back
to
the
bed
sinking
down
and
sitting
on
the
edge
of
it
he
was
still
in
the
clutch
of
the
past
he
looked
about
the
room
perplexed
alarmed
wondering
where
he
was
until
he
caught
sight
of
the
pile
of
manuscripts
in
the
corner
then
the
wheels
of
memory
slipped
ahead
through
four
years
of
time
and
he
was
aware
of
the
present
of
the
books
he
had
opened
and
the
universe
he
had
won
from
their
pages
of
his
dreams
and
ambitions
and
of
his
love
for
a
pale
wraith
of
a
girl
sensitive
and
sheltered
and
ethereal
who
would
die
of
horror
did
she
witness
but
one
moment
of
what
he
had
just
lived
moment
of
all
the
muck
of
life
through
which
he
had
waded
he
arose
to
his
feet
and
confronted
himself
in
the
so
you
arise
from
the
mud
martin
eden
he
said
solemnly
you
cleanse
your
eyes
in
a
great
brightness
and
thrust
your
shoulders
among
the
stars
doing
what
all
life
has
done
letting
the
and
tiger
and
wresting
highest
heritage
from
all
powers
that
he
looked
more
closely
at
himself
and
laughed
bit
of
hysteria
and
melodrama
eh
he
queried
never
mind
you
licked
and
lick
the
editors
if
it
takes
twice
eleven
years
to
do
it
in
you
stop
here
got
to
go
on
to
a
finish
you
chapter
xvi
the
went
off
jerking
martin
out
of
sleep
with
a
suddenness
that
would
have
given
headache
to
one
with
less
splendid
constitution
though
he
slept
soundly
he
awoke
instantly
like
a
cat
and
he
awoke
eagerly
glad
that
the
five
hours
of
unconsciousness
were
gone
he
hated
the
oblivion
of
sleep
there
was
too
much
to
do
too
much
of
life
to
live
he
grudged
every
moment
of
life
sleep
robbed
him
of
and
before
the
clock
had
ceased
its
clattering
he
was
head
and
ears
in
the
washbasin
and
thrilling
to
the
cold
bite
of
the
water
but
he
did
not
follow
his
regular
programme
there
was
no
unfinished
story
waiting
his
hand
no
new
story
demanding
articulation
he
had
studied
late
and
it
was
nearly
time
for
breakfast
he
tried
to
read
a
chapter
in
fiske
but
his
brain
was
restless
and
he
closed
the
book
witnessed
the
beginning
of
the
new
battle
wherein
for
some
time
there
would
be
no
writing
he
was
aware
of
a
sadness
akin
to
that
with
which
one
leaves
home
and
family
he
looked
at
the
manuscripts
in
the
corner
that
was
it
he
was
going
away
from
them
his
pitiful
dishonored
children
that
were
welcome
nowhere
he
went
over
and
began
to
rummage
among
them
reading
snatches
here
and
there
his
favorite
portions
he
honored
with
reading
aloud
as
he
did
his
completed
the
day
before
and
tossed
into
the
corner
for
lack
of
stamps
won
his
keenest
approbation
understand
he
murmured
maybe
the
editors
who
understand
nothing
wrong
with
that
they
publish
worse
every
month
everything
they
publish
is
everything
after
breakfast
he
put
the
in
its
case
and
carried
it
down
into
oakland
owe
a
month
on
it
he
told
the
clerk
in
the
store
you
tell
the
manager
going
to
work
and
that
be
in
in
a
month
or
so
and
straighten
he
crossed
on
the
ferry
to
san
francisco
and
made
his
way
to
an
employment
office
kind
of
work
no
trade
he
told
the
agent
and
was
interrupted
by
a
dressed
rather
foppishly
as
some
workingmen
dress
who
have
instincts
for
finer
things
the
agent
shook
his
head
despondently
eh
said
the
other
i
got
to
get
somebody
he
turned
and
stared
at
martin
and
martin
staring
back
noted
the
puffed
and
discolored
face
handsome
and
weak
and
knew
that
he
had
been
making
a
night
of
it
for
a
job
the
other
queried
can
you
do
labor
sailorizing
run
a
no
shorthand
can
sit
on
a
horse
willing
to
do
anything
and
tackle
anything
was
the
answer
the
other
nodded
good
to
me
my
dawson
joe
dawson
to
scare
up
a
much
for
martin
caught
an
amusing
glimpse
of
himself
ironing
fluffy
white
things
that
women
wear
but
he
had
taken
a
liking
to
the
other
and
he
added
might
do
the
plain
washing
i
learned
that
much
at
joe
dawson
thought
visibly
for
a
moment
here

nodded

the
work

and
assistant

boss

for
me
but
you
work
under
me
think
be
to
learn
martin
paused
to
think
the
prospect
was
alluring
a
few
months
of
it
and
he
would
have
time
to
himself
for
study
he
could
work
hard
and
study
hard
grub
a
room
to
yourself
joe
said
that
settled
it
a
room
to
himself
where
he
could
burn
the
midnight
oil
unmolested
work
like
hell
the
other
added
martin
caressed
his
swelling
significantly
came
from
hard
get
to
joe
held
his
hand
to
his
head
for
a
moment
but
a
can
hardly

down
the
line
last
the
the
wages

martin
announced
stretching
out
his
hand
which
the
other
shook
advance
ticket
and
extras
blew
it
in
was
sad
answer
with
another
reach
at
his
aching
head
i
got
is
a
return
i
pay
my
it
joe
advised
owe
it
to
my
joe
whistled
a
long
perplexed
whistle
and
racked
his
brains
to
little
purpose
got
the
price
of
the
drinks
he
said
desperately
on
mebbe
cook
up
martin
declined
this
time
martin
nodded
and
joe
lamented
i
i
somehow
just
he
said
in
extenuation
ben
like
hell
all
week
i
just
got
to
booze
up
if
i
cut
my
throat
or
burn
up
the
premises
but
glad
on
the
wagon
stay
with
martin
knew
of
the
enormous
gulf
between
him
and
this
gulf
the
books
had
made
but
he
found
no
difficulty
in
crossing
back
over
that
gulf
he
had
lived
all
his
life
in
the
world
and
the
of
labor
was
second
nature
with
him
he
solved
the
difficulty
of
transportation
that
was
too
much
for
the
aching
head
he
would
send
his
trunk
up
to
shelly
hot
springs
on
ticket
as
for
himself
there
was
his
wheel
it
was
seventy
miles
and
he
could
ride
it
on
sunday
and
be
ready
for
work
monday
morning
in
the
meantime
he
would
go
home
and
pack
up
there
was
no
one
to
say
to
ruth
and
her
whole
family
were
spending
the
long
summer
in
the
sierras
at
lake
tahoe
he
arrived
at
shelly
hot
springs
tired
and
dusty
on
sunday
night
joe
greeted
him
exuberantly
with
a
wet
towel
bound
about
his
aching
brow
he
had
been
at
work
all
day
of
last
mounted
up
me
away
to
get
you
he
explained
box
arrived
all
right
in
your
room
but
a
hell
of
a
thing
to
call
a
trunk
in
it
gold
bricks
joe
sat
on
the
bed
while
martin
unpacked
the
box
was
a
for
breakfast
food
and
higginbotham
had
charged
him
half
a
dollar
for
it
two
rope
handles
nailed
on
by
martin
had
technically
transformed
it
into
a
trunk
eligible
for
the
joe
watched
with
bulging
eyes
a
few
shirts
and
several
changes
of
underclothes
come
out
of
the
box
followed
by
books
and
more
books
clean
to
the
bottom
he
asked
martin
nodded
and
went
on
arranging
the
books
on
a
kitchen
table
which
served
in
the
room
in
place
of
a
joe
exploded
then
waited
in
silence
for
the
deduction
to
arise
in
his
brain
at
last
it
came
you
care
for
the
he
queried
was
the
answer
used
to
chase
a
lot
before
i
tackled
the
books
but
since
then
no
there
be
any
time
here
all
you
can
do
is
work
martin
thought
of
his
five
sleep
a
night
and
smiled
the
room
was
situated
over
the
laundry
and
was
in
the
same
building
with
the
engine
that
pumped
water
made
electricity
and
ran
the
laundry
machinery
the
engineer
who
occupied
the
adjoining
room
dropped
in
to
meet
the
new
hand
and
helped
martin
rig
up
an
electric
bulb
on
an
extension
wire
so
that
it
travelled
along
a
stretched
cord
from
over
the
table
to
the
bed
the
next
morning
at
six
martin
was
routed
out
for
a
breakfast
there
happened
to
be
a
for
the
servants
in
the
laundry
building
and
he
electrified
joe
by
taking
a
cold
bath
but
a
hummer
joe
announced
as
they
sat
down
to
breakfast
in
a
corner
of
the
hotel
kitchen
with
them
was
the
engineer
the
gardener
and
the
assistant
gardener
and
two
or
three
men
from
the
stable
they
ate
hurriedly
and
gloomily
with
but
little
conversation
and
as
martin
ate
and
listened
he
realized
how
far
he
had
travelled
from
their
status
their
small
mental
caliber
was
depressing
to
him
and
he
was
anxious
to
get
away
from
them
so
he
bolted
his
breakfast
a
sickly
sloppy
affair
as
rapidly
as
they
and
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
passed
out
through
the
kitchen
door
it
was
a
perfectly
appointed
small
steam
laundry
wherein
the
most
modern
machinery
did
everything
that
was
possible
for
machinery
to
do
martin
after
a
few
instructions
sorted
the
great
heaps
of
soiled
clothes
while
joe
started
the
masher
and
made
up
fresh
supplies
of
compounded
of
biting
chemicals
that
compelled
him
to
swathe
his
mouth
and
nostrils
and
eyes
in
till
he
resembled
a
mummy
finished
the
sorting
martin
lent
a
hand
in
wringing
the
clothes
this
was
done
by
dumping
them
into
a
spinning
receptacle
that
went
at
a
rate
of
a
few
thousand
revolutions
a
minute
tearing
the
water
from
the
clothes
by
centrifugal
force
then
martin
began
to
alternate
between
the
dryer
and
the
wringer
between
times
socks
and
stockings
by
the
afternoon
one
feeding
and
one
stacking
up
they
were
running
socks
and
stockings
through
the
mangle
while
the
irons
were
heating
then
it
was
hot
irons
and
underclothes
till
six
at
which
time
joe
shook
his
head
dubiously
behind
he
said
to
work
after
and
after
supper
they
worked
until
ten
under
the
blazing
electric
lights
until
the
last
piece
of
was
ironed
and
folded
away
in
the
distributing
room
it
was
a
hot
california
night
and
though
the
windows
were
thrown
wide
the
room
with
its
was
a
furnace
martin
and
joe
down
to
undershirts
bare
armed
sweated
and
panted
for
air
trimming
cargo
in
the
tropics
martin
said
when
they
went
upstairs
do
joe
answered
take
hold
like
a
good
fellow
if
you
keep
up
the
pace
be
on
thirty
dollars
only
one
month
the
second
month
be
your
forty
but
tell
me
you
never
ironed
before
i
know
ironed
a
rag
in
my
life
honestly
until
martin
protested
he
was
surprised
at
his
weariness
when
he
got
into
his
room
forgetful
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
on
his
feet
and
working
without
let
up
for
fourteen
hours
he
set
the
alarm
clock
at
six
and
measured
back
five
hours
to
one
he
could
read
until
then
slipping
off
his
shoes
to
ease
his
swollen
feet
he
sat
down
at
the
table
with
his
books
he
opened
fiske
where
he
had
left
off
to
read
but
he
found
trouble
and
began
to
read
it
through
a
second
time
then
he
awoke
in
pain
from
his
stiffened
muscles
and
chilled
by
the
mountain
wind
that
had
begun
to
blow
in
through
the
window
he
looked
at
the
clock
it
marked
two
he
had
been
asleep
four
hours
he
pulled
off
his
clothes
and
crawled
into
bed
where
he
was
asleep
the
moment
after
his
head
touched
the
pillow
tuesday
was
a
day
of
similar
unremitting
toil
the
speed
with
which
joe
worked
won
admiration
joe
was
a
dozen
of
demons
for
work
he
was
keyed
up
to
concert
pitch
and
there
was
never
a
moment
in
the
long
day
when
he
was
not
fighting
for
moments
he
concentrated
himself
upon
his
work
and
upon
how
to
save
time
pointing
out
to
martin
where
he
did
in
five
motions
what
could
be
done
in
three
or
in
three
motions
what
could
be
done
in
two
of
waste
motion
martin
phrased
it
as
he
watched
and
patterned
after
he
was
a
good
workman
himself
quick
and
deft
and
it
had
always
been
a
point
of
pride
with
him
that
no
man
should
do
any
of
his
work
for
him
or
outwork
him
as
a
result
he
concentrated
with
a
similar
singleness
of
purpose
greedily
snapping
up
the
hints
and
suggestions
thrown
out
by
his
working
mate
he
collars
and
cuffs
rubbing
the
starch
out
from
between
the
double
thicknesses
of
linen
so
that
there
would
be
no
blisters
when
it
came
to
the
ironing
and
doing
it
at
a
pace
that
elicited
praise
there
was
never
an
interval
when
something
was
not
at
hand
to
be
done
joe
waited
for
nothing
waited
on
nothing
and
went
on
the
jump
from
task
to
task
they
starched
two
hundred
white
shirts
with
a
single
gathering
movement
seizing
a
shirt
so
that
the
wristbands
neckband
yoke
and
bosom
protruded
beyond
the
circling
right
hand
at
the
same
moment
the
left
hand
held
up
the
body
of
the
shirt
so
that
it
would
not
enter
the
starch
and
at
the
same
moment
the
right
hand
dipped
into
the
so
hot
that
in
order
to
wring
it
out
their
hands
had
to
thrust
and
thrust
continually
into
a
bucket
of
cold
water
and
that
night
they
worked
till
ten
dipping
the
frilled
and
airy
delicate
wear
of
ladies
for
the
tropics
and
no
clothes
martin
laughed
me
out
of
a
job
joe
answered
seriously
know
but
you
know
it
ought
to
began
in
the
contra
costa
in
oakland
when
i
was
eleven
out
for
the
mangle
that
was
eighteen
years
ago
never
done
a
tap
of
anything
else
but
this
job
is
the
fiercest
i
ever
had
ought
to
be
one
more
man
on
it
at
least
we
work
night
always
run
the
mangle
wednesday
martin
set
his
alarm
drew
up
to
the
table
and
opened
fiske
he
did
not
finish
the
first
paragraph
the
lines
blurred
and
ran
together
and
his
head
nodded
he
walked
up
and
down
batting
his
head
savagely
with
his
fists
but
he
could
not
conquer
the
numbness
of
sleep
he
propped
the
book
before
him
and
propped
his
eyelids
with
his
fingers
and
fell
asleep
with
his
eyes
wide
open
then
he
surrendered
and
scarcely
conscious
of
what
he
did
got
off
his
clothes
and
into
bed
he
slept
seven
hours
of
heavy
sleep
and
awoke
by
the
alarm
feeling
that
he
had
not
had
enough
much
joe
asked
martin
shook
his
head
mind
we
got
to
run
the
mangle
but
thursday
knock
off
at
six
give
you
a
martin
washed
woollens
that
day
by
hand
in
a
large
barrel
with
strong
by
means
of
a
hub
from
a
wagon
wheel
mounted
on
a
that
was
attached
to
a
overhead
invention
joe
said
proudly
a
washboard
your
knuckles
and
besides
it
saves
at
least
fifteen
minutes
in
the
week
fifteen
minutes
to
be
sneezed
at
in
this
running
the
collars
and
cuffs
through
the
mangle
was
also
idea
that
night
while
they
toiled
on
under
the
electric
lights
he
explained
it
no
laundry
ever
does
except
this
one
i
got
to
do
it
if
to
get
done
saturday
afternoon
at
three
but
i
know
how
the
difference
got
to
have
right
heat
right
pressure
and
run
through
three
times
look
at
that
he
held
a
cuff
aloft
do
it
better
by
hand
or
on
a
thursday
joe
was
in
a
rage
a
bundle
of
extra
had
come
in
to
quit
he
announced
stand
for
it
to
quit
it
cold
the
good
of
me
like
a
slave
all
week
minutes
them
in
extras
on
me
this
is
a
free
country
to
tell
that
fat
dutchman
what
i
think
of
him
i
tell
in
french
plain
united
states
is
good
enough
for
me
him
in
fancy
starch
extras
got
to
work
he
said
the
next
moment
reversing
his
judgment
and
surrendering
to
fate
and
martin
did
no
reading
that
night
he
had
seen
no
daily
paper
all
week
and
strangely
to
him
felt
no
desire
to
see
one
he
was
not
interested
in
the
news
he
was
too
tired
and
jaded
to
be
interested
in
anything
though
he
planned
to
leave
saturday
afternoon
if
they
finished
at
three
and
ride
on
his
wheel
to
oakland
it
was
seventy
miles
and
the
same
distance
back
on
sunday
afternoon
would
leave
him
anything
but
rested
for
the
second
work
it
would
have
been
easier
to
go
on
the
train
but
the
round
trip
was
two
dollars
and
a
half
and
he
was
intent
on
saving
money
chapter
xvii
martin
learned
to
do
many
things
in
the
course
of
the
first
week
in
one
afternoon
he
and
joe
accounted
for
the
two
hundred
white
shirts
joe
ran
the
tiler
a
machine
wherein
a
hot
iron
was
hooked
on
a
steel
string
which
furnished
the
pressure
by
this
means
he
ironed
the
yoke
wristbands
and
neckband
setting
the
latter
at
right
angles
to
the
shirt
and
put
the
glossy
finish
on
the
bosom
as
fast
as
he
finished
them
he
flung
the
shirts
on
a
rack
between
him
and
martin
who
caught
them
up
and
them
this
task
consisted
of
ironing
all
the
unstarched
portions
of
the
shirts
it
was
exhausting
work
carried
on
hour
after
hour
at
top
speed
out
on
the
broad
verandas
of
the
hotel
men
and
women
in
cool
white
sipped
iced
drinks
and
kept
their
circulation
down
but
in
the
laundry
the
air
was
sizzling
the
huge
stove
roared
red
hot
and
white
hot
while
the
irons
moving
over
the
damp
cloth
sent
up
clouds
of
steam
the
heat
of
these
irons
was
different
from
that
used
by
housewives
an
iron
that
stood
the
ordinary
test
of
a
wet
finger
was
too
cold
for
joe
and
martin
and
such
test
was
useless
they
went
wholly
by
holding
the
irons
close
to
their
cheeks
gauging
the
heat
by
some
secret
mental
process
that
martin
admired
but
could
not
understand
when
the
fresh
irons
proved
too
hot
they
hooked
them
on
iron
rods
and
dipped
them
into
cold
water
this
again
required
a
precise
and
subtle
judgment
a
fraction
of
a
second
too
long
in
the
water
and
the
fine
and
silken
edge
of
the
proper
heat
was
lost
and
martin
found
time
to
marvel
at
the
accuracy
he
automatic
accuracy
founded
upon
criteria
that
were
and
unerring
but
there
was
little
time
in
which
to
marvel
all
consciousness
was
concentrated
in
the
work
ceaselessly
active
head
and
hand
an
intelligent
machine
all
that
constituted
him
a
man
was
devoted
to
furnishing
that
intelligence
there
was
no
room
in
his
brain
for
the
universe
and
its
mighty
problems
all
the
broad
and
spacious
corridors
of
his
mind
were
closed
and
hermetically
sealed
the
echoing
chamber
of
his
soul
was
a
narrow
room
a
conning
tower
whence
were
directed
his
arm
and
shoulder
muscles
his
ten
nimble
fingers
and
the
iron
along
its
steaming
path
in
broad
sweeping
strokes
just
so
many
strokes
and
no
more
just
so
far
with
each
stroke
and
not
a
fraction
of
an
inch
farther
rushing
along
interminable
sleeves
sides
backs
and
tails
and
tossing
the
finished
shirts
without
rumpling
upon
the
receiving
frame
and
even
as
his
hurrying
soul
tossed
it
was
reaching
for
another
shirt
this
went
on
hour
after
hour
while
outside
all
the
world
swooned
under
the
overhead
california
sun
but
there
was
no
swooning
in
that
superheated
room
the
cool
guests
on
the
verandas
needed
clean
linen
the
sweat
poured
from
martin
he
drank
enormous
quantities
of
water
but
so
great
was
the
heat
of
the
day
and
of
his
exertions
that
the
water
sluiced
through
the
interstices
of
his
flesh
and
out
at
all
his
pores
always
at
sea
except
at
rare
intervals
the
work
he
performed
had
given
him
ample
opportunity
to
commune
with
himself
the
master
of
the
ship
had
been
lord
of
time
but
here
the
manager
of
the
hotel
was
lord
of
thoughts
as
well
he
had
no
thoughts
save
for
the
toil
outside
of
that
it
was
impossible
to
think
he
did
not
know
that
he
loved
ruth
she
did
not
even
exist
for
his
driven
soul
had
no
time
to
remember
her
it
was
only
when
he
crawled
to
bed
at
night
or
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
that
she
asserted
herself
to
him
in
fleeting
memories
is
hell
it
joe
remarked
once
martin
nodded
but
felt
a
rasp
of
irritation
the
statement
had
been
obvious
and
unnecessary
they
did
not
talk
while
they
worked
conversation
threw
them
out
of
their
stride
as
it
did
this
time
compelling
martin
to
miss
a
stroke
of
his
iron
and
to
make
two
extra
motions
before
he
caught
his
stride
again
on
friday
morning
the
washer
ran
twice
a
week
they
had
to
put
through
hotel
linen
sheets
spreads
and
napkins
this
finished
they
buckled
down
to
it
was
slow
work
fastidious
and
delicate
and
martin
did
not
learn
it
so
readily
besides
he
could
not
take
chances
mistakes
were
disastrous
that
joe
said
holding
up
a
filmy
that
he
could
have
crumpled
from
view
in
one
hand
that
twenty
dollars
out
of
your
so
martin
did
not
scorch
that
and
eased
down
on
his
muscular
tension
though
nervous
tension
rose
higher
than
ever
and
he
listened
sympathetically
to
the
blasphemies
as
he
toiled
and
suffered
over
the
beautiful
things
that
women
wear
when
they
do
not
have
to
do
their
own
laundrying
was
nightmare
and
it
was
too
it
was
that
robbed
them
of
their
minutes
they
toiled
at
it
all
day
at
seven
in
the
evening
they
broke
off
to
run
the
hotel
linen
through
the
mangle
at
ten
while
the
hotel
guests
slept
the
two
laundrymen
sweated
on
at
till
midnight
till
one
till
two
at
two
they
knocked
off
saturday
morning
it
was
starch
and
odds
and
ends
and
at
three
in
the
afternoon
the
work
was
done
to
ride
them
seventy
miles
into
oakland
on
top
of
this
joe
demanded
as
they
sat
on
the
stairs
and
took
a
triumphant
smoke
to
was
the
answer
are
you
for
girl
to
save
two
and
a
half
on
the
railroad
ticket
i
want
to
renew
some
books
at
the
you
send
down
up
by
express
cost
only
a
quarter
each
martin
considered
it
take
a
rest
the
other
urged
need
it
i
know
i
do
plumb
tuckered
he
looked
it
indomitable
never
resting
fighting
for
seconds
and
minutes
all
week
circumventing
delays
and
crushing
down
obstacles
a
fount
of
resistless
energy
a
human
motor
a
demon
for
work
now
that
he
had
accomplished
the
task
he
was
in
a
state
of
collapse
he
was
worn
and
haggard
and
his
handsome
face
drooped
in
lean
exhaustion
he
pulled
his
cigarette
spiritlessly
and
his
voice
was
peculiarly
dead
and
monotonous
all
the
snap
and
fire
had
gone
out
of
him
his
triumph
seemed
a
sorry
one
next
week
we
got
to
do
it
all
over
again
he
said
sadly
the
good
of
it
all
hey
sometimes
i
wish
i
was
a
hobo
they
work
they
get
their
gee
i
wish
i
had
a
glass
of
beer
but
i
get
up
the
gumption
to
go
down
to
the
village
get
it
stay
over
send
your
books
down
by
express
or
else
a
damn
what
can
i
do
here
all
day
sunday
martin
asked
you
know
how
tired
you
are
why
that
tired
sunday
i
even
read
the
papers
i
was
sick
in
the
hospital
two
months
a
half
do
a
tap
of
work
all
that
time
it
was
was
beautiful
he
repeated
dreamily
a
minute
later
martin
took
a
bath
after
which
he
found
that
the
head
laundryman
had
disappeared
most
likely
he
had
gone
for
a
glass
of
beer
martin
decided
but
the
walk
down
to
the
village
to
find
out
seemed
a
long
journey
to
him
he
lay
on
his
bed
with
his
shoes
off
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
he
did
not
reach
out
for
a
book
he
was
too
tired
to
feel
sleepy
and
he
lay
scarcely
thinking
in
a
of
weariness
until
it
was
time
for
supper
joe
did
not
appear
for
that
function
and
when
martin
heard
the
gardener
remark
that
most
likely
he
was
ripping
the
slats
off
the
bar
martin
understood
he
went
to
bed
immediately
afterward
and
in
the
morning
decided
that
he
was
greatly
rested
joe
being
still
absent
martin
procured
a
sunday
paper
and
lay
down
in
a
shady
nook
under
the
trees
the
morning
passed
he
knew
not
how
he
did
not
sleep
nobody
disturbed
him
and
he
did
not
finish
the
paper
he
came
back
to
it
in
the
afternoon
after
dinner
and
fell
asleep
over
it
so
passed
sunday
and
monday
morning
he
was
hard
at
work
sorting
clothes
while
joe
a
towel
bound
tightly
around
his
head
with
groans
and
blasphemies
was
running
the
washer
and
mixing
simply
help
it
he
explained
got
to
drink
when
saturday
night
comes
another
week
passed
a
great
battle
that
continued
under
the
electric
lights
each
night
and
that
culminated
on
saturday
afternoon
at
three
when
joe
tasted
his
moment
of
wilted
triumph
and
then
drifted
down
to
the
village
to
forget
sunday
was
the
same
as
before
he
slept
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
toiled
aimlessly
through
the
newspaper
and
spent
long
hours
lying
on
his
back
doing
nothing
thinking
nothing
he
was
too
dazed
to
think
though
he
was
aware
that
he
did
not
like
himself
he
was
as
though
he
had
undergone
some
degradation
or
was
intrinsically
foul
all
that
was
in
him
was
blotted
out
the
spur
of
ambition
was
blunted
he
had
no
vitality
with
which
to
feel
the
prod
of
it
he
was
dead
his
soul
seemed
dead
he
was
a
beast
a
he
saw
no
beauty
in
the
sunshine
sifting
down
through
the
green
leaves
nor
did
the
azure
vault
of
the
sky
whisper
as
of
old
and
hint
of
cosmic
vastness
and
secrets
trembling
to
disclosure
life
was
intolerably
dull
and
stupid
and
its
taste
was
bad
in
his
mouth
a
black
screen
was
drawn
across
his
mirror
of
inner
vision
and
fancy
lay
in
a
darkened
where
entered
no
ray
of
light
he
envied
joe
down
in
the
village
rampant
tearing
the
slats
off
the
bar
his
brain
gnawing
with
maggots
exulting
in
maudlin
ways
over
maudlin
things
fantastically
and
gloriously
drunk
and
forgetful
of
monday
morning
and
the
week
of
deadening
toil
to
come
a
third
week
went
by
and
martin
loathed
himself
and
loathed
life
he
was
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
failure
there
was
reason
for
the
editors
refusing
his
stuff
he
could
see
that
clearly
now
and
laugh
at
himself
and
the
dreams
he
had
dreamed
ruth
returned
his
by
mail
he
read
her
letter
apathetically
she
did
her
best
to
say
how
much
she
liked
them
and
that
they
were
beautiful
but
she
could
not
lie
and
she
could
not
disguise
the
truth
from
herself
she
knew
they
were
failures
and
he
read
her
disapproval
in
every
perfunctory
and
unenthusiastic
line
of
her
letter
and
she
was
right
he
was
firmly
convinced
of
it
as
he
read
the
poems
over
beauty
and
wonder
had
departed
from
him
and
as
he
read
the
poems
he
caught
himself
puzzling
as
to
what
he
had
had
in
mind
when
he
wrote
them
his
audacities
of
phrase
struck
him
as
grotesque
his
felicities
of
expression
were
monstrosities
and
everything
was
absurd
unreal
and
impossible
he
would
have
burned
the
on
the
spot
had
his
will
been
strong
enough
to
set
them
aflame
there
was
the
but
the
exertion
of
carrying
them
to
the
furnace
was
not
worth
while
all
his
exertion
was
used
in
washing
other
clothes
he
did
not
have
any
left
for
private
affairs
he
resolved
that
when
sunday
came
he
would
pull
himself
together
and
answer
letter
but
saturday
afternoon
after
work
was
finished
and
he
had
taken
a
bath
the
desire
to
forget
overpowered
him
guess
go
down
and
see
how
getting
on
was
the
way
he
put
it
to
himself
and
in
the
same
moment
he
knew
that
he
lied
but
he
did
not
have
the
energy
to
consider
the
lie
if
he
had
had
the
energy
he
would
have
refused
to
consider
the
lie
because
he
wanted
to
forget
he
started
for
the
village
slowly
and
casually
increasing
his
pace
in
spite
of
himself
as
he
neared
the
saloon
thought
you
was
on
the
was
greeting
martin
did
not
deign
to
offer
excuses
but
called
for
whiskey
filling
his
own
glass
brimming
before
he
passed
the
bottle
take
all
night
about
it
he
said
roughly
the
other
was
dawdling
with
the
bottle
and
martin
refused
to
wait
for
him
tossing
the
glass
off
in
a
gulp
and
refilling
it
i
can
wait
for
you
he
said
grimly
hurry
joe
hurried
and
they
drank
together
work
did
it
eh
joe
queried
martin
refused
to
discuss
the
matter
fair
hell
i
know
the
other
went
on
i
kind
of
hate
to
see
you
come
off
the
wagon
mart
well
how
martin
drank
on
silently
biting
out
his
orders
and
invitations
and
awing
the
barkeeper
an
effeminate
country
youngster
with
watery
blue
eyes
and
hair
parted
in
the
middle
something
scandalous
the
way
they
work
us
poor
devils
joe
was
remarking
i
bowl
up
break
loose
burn
down
the
shebang
my
up
is
all
that
saves
i
can
tell
you
but
martin
made
no
answer
a
few
more
drinks
and
in
his
brain
he
felt
the
maggots
of
intoxication
beginning
to
crawl
ah
it
was
living
the
first
breath
of
life
he
had
breathed
in
three
weeks
his
dreams
came
back
to
him
fancy
came
out
of
the
darkened
room
and
lured
him
on
a
thing
of
flaming
brightness
his
mirror
of
vision
was
a
flashing
dazzling
palimpsest
of
imagery
wonder
and
beauty
walked
with
him
hand
in
hand
and
all
power
was
his
he
tried
to
tell
it
to
joe
but
joe
had
visions
of
his
own
infallible
schemes
whereby
he
would
escape
the
slavery
of
and
become
himself
the
owner
of
a
great
steam
laundry
tell
yeh
mart
they
be
no
kids
in
my
on
yer
life
they
be
no
a
soul
after
six
you
hear
me

machinery
enough
hands
enough
to
do
it
all
in
decent
hours

superintendent
of
the
whole
of
it
all
of
it
now
the
scheme
i
get
on
the
save
my
money
for
two
but
martin
turned
away
leaving
him
to
tell
it
to
the
barkeeper
until
that
worthy
was
called
away
to
furnish
drinks
to
two
farmers
who
coming
in
accepted
invitation
martin
dispensed
royal
largess
inviting
everybody
up
a
stableman
and
the
assistant
from
the
hotel
the
barkeeper
and
the
furtive
hobo
who
slid
in
like
a
shadow
and
like
a
shadow
hovered
at
the
end
of
the
bar
chapter
xviii
monday
morning
joe
groaned
over
the
first
truck
load
of
clothes
to
the
washer
say
he
began
talk
to
me
martin
snarled
sorry
joe
he
said
at
noon
when
they
knocked
off
for
dinner
tears
came
into
the
eyes
all
right
old
man
he
said
in
hell
we
help
ourselves
you
know
i
kind
of
like
you
a
whole
lot
what
made
i
cottoned
to
you
from
the
martin
shook
his
hand
quit
joe
suggested
chuck
it
go
i
never
tried
it
but
it
must
be
dead
easy
to
do
just
think
of
it
to
do
i
was
sick
once
typhoid
in
the
hospital
it
was
beautiful
i
wish
get
sick
the
week
dragged
on
the
hotel
was
full
and
extra
poured
in
upon
them
they
performed
prodigies
of
valor
they
fought
late
each
night
under
the
electric
lights
bolted
their
meals
and
even
got
in
a
half
work
before
breakfast
martin
no
longer
took
his
cold
baths
every
moment
was
drive
drive
drive
and
joe
was
the
masterful
shepherd
of
moments
herding
them
carefully
never
losing
one
counting
them
over
like
a
miser
counting
gold
working
on
in
a
frenzy
a
feverish
machine
aided
ably
by
that
other
machine
that
thought
of
itself
as
once
having
been
one
martin
eden
a
man
but
it
was
only
at
rare
moments
that
martin
was
able
to
think
the
house
of
thought
was
closed
its
windows
boarded
up
and
he
was
its
shadowy
caretaker
he
was
a
shadow
joe
was
right
they
were
both
shadows
and
this
was
the
unending
limbo
of
toil
or
was
it
a
dream
sometimes
in
the
steaming
sizzling
heat
as
he
swung
the
heavy
irons
back
and
forth
over
the
white
garments
it
came
to
him
that
it
was
a
dream
in
a
short
while
or
maybe
after
a
thousand
years
or
so
he
would
awake
in
his
little
room
with
the
table
and
take
up
his
writing
where
he
had
left
off
the
day
before
or
maybe
that
was
a
dream
too
and
the
awakening
would
be
the
changing
of
the
watches
when
he
would
drop
down
out
of
his
bunk
in
the
lurching
forecastle
and
go
up
on
deck
under
the
tropic
stars
and
take
the
wheel
and
feel
the
cool
tradewind
blowing
through
his
flesh
came
saturday
and
its
hollow
victory
at
three
go
down
get
a
glass
of
beer
joe
said
in
the
queer
monotonous
tones
that
marked
his
collapse
martin
seemed
suddenly
to
wake
up
he
opened
the
kit
bag
and
oiled
his
wheel
putting
graphite
on
the
chain
and
adjusting
the
bearings
joe
was
halfway
down
to
the
saloon
when
martin
passed
by
bending
low
over
the
his
legs
driving
the
gear
with
rhythmic
strength
his
face
set
for
seventy
miles
of
road
and
grade
and
dust
he
slept
in
oakland
that
night
and
on
sunday
covered
the
seventy
miles
back
and
on
monday
morning
weary
he
began
the
new
work
but
he
had
kept
sober
a
fifth
week
passed
and
a
sixth
during
which
he
lived
and
toiled
as
a
machine
with
just
a
spark
of
something
more
in
him
just
a
glimmering
bit
of
soul
that
compelled
him
at
each
to
scorch
off
the
hundred
and
forty
miles
but
this
was
not
rest
it
was
and
it
helped
to
crush
out
the
glimmering
bit
of
soul
that
was
all
that
was
left
him
from
former
life
at
the
end
of
the
seventh
week
without
intending
it
too
weak
to
resist
he
drifted
down
to
the
village
with
joe
and
drowned
life
and
found
life
until
monday
morning
again
at
the
he
ground
out
the
one
hundred
and
forty
miles
obliterating
the
numbness
of
too
great
exertion
by
the
numbness
of
still
greater
exertion
at
the
end
of
three
months
he
went
down
a
third
time
to
the
village
with
joe
he
forgot
and
lived
again
and
living
he
saw
in
clear
illumination
the
beast
he
was
making
of
by
the
drink
but
by
the
work
the
drink
was
an
effect
not
a
cause
it
followed
inevitably
upon
the
work
as
the
night
follows
upon
the
day
not
by
becoming
a
could
he
win
to
the
heights
was
the
message
the
whiskey
whispered
to
him
and
he
nodded
approbation
the
whiskey
was
wise
it
told
secrets
on
itself
he
called
for
paper
and
pencil
and
for
drinks
all
around
and
while
they
drank
his
very
good
health
he
clung
to
the
bar
and
scribbled
telegram
joe
he
said
joe
read
it
with
a
drunken
quizzical
leer
but
what
he
read
seemed
to
sober
him
he
looked
at
the
other
reproachfully
tears
oozing
into
his
eyes
and
down
his
cheeks
back
on
me
mart
he
queried
hopelessly
martin
nodded
and
called
one
of
the
loungers
to
him
to
take
the
message
to
the
telegraph
office
on
joe
muttered
thickly
lem
me
he
held
on
to
the
bar
his
legs
wobbling
under
him
arm
around
him
and
supporting
him
while
he
thought
that
two
laundrymen
he
said
abruptly
lem
me
fix

you
quitting
for
martin
demanded
reason
as
going
to
sea
you
do
was
the
answer
i
can
hobo
all
right
all
martin
looked
at
him
searchingly
for
a
moment
then
cried
god
i
think
right
better
a
hobo
than
a
beast
of
toil
why
man
live
and
more
than
you
ever
did
was
in
hospital
once
joe
corrected

beautiful
i

while
martin
changed
the
telegram
to
laundrymen
joe
went
on
never
wanted
to
drink
when
i
was
in
hospital
funny
it
but
when
ben
like
a
slave
all

that
cooks

hell

work

to
here
lem

pay
half
of
that
shake
you
for
it
martin
offered
on
everybody
drink
joe
called
as
they
rattled
the
dice
and
rolled
them
out
on
the
damp
bar
monday
morning
joe
was
wild
with
anticipation
he
did
not
mind
his
aching
head
nor
did
he
take
interest
in
his
work
whole
herds
of
moments
stole
away
and
were
lost
while
their
careless
shepherd
gazed
out
of
the
window
at
the
sunshine
and
the
trees
look
at
it
he
cried
all
mine
free
i
can
lie
down
under
them
trees
sleep
for
a
years
if
i
want
to
aw
come
on
mart

the
good
of
another
moment
the
land
of
to
do
out
there
i
got
a
ticket
for
it
no
return
ticket
a
few
minutes
later
filling
the
truck
with
soiled
clothes
for
the
washer
joe
spied
the
hotel
shirt
he
knew
its
mark
and
with
a
sudden
glorious
consciousness
of
freedom
he
threw
it
on
the
floor
and
stamped
on
it
wish
you
was
in
it
you
dutchman
he
shouted
it
right
there
where
got
you
take
that
that
that
damn
you
hold
me
back
somebody
hold
me
back
martin
laughed
and
held
him
to
his
work
on
tuesday
night
the
new
laundrymen
arrived
and
the
rest
of
the
week
was
spent
breaking
them
into
the
routine
joe
sat
around
and
explained
his
system
but
he
did
no
more
work
a
tap
he
announced
a
tap
they
can
fire
me
if
they
want
to
but
if
they
do
quit
no
more
work
in
mine
thank
you
kindly
me
for
the
freight
cars
the
shade
under
the
trees
go
to
it
you
slaves
right
slave
sweat
slave
sweat
when
dead
rot
the
same
as
me
it
matter
how
you
live
tell
me
it
matter
in
the
long
run
on
saturday
they
drew
their
pay
and
came
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
no
use
in
me
you
to
change
your
mind
hit
the
road
with
me
joe
asked
hopelessly
martin
shook
his
head
he
was
standing
by
his
wheel
ready
to
start
they
shook
hands
and
joe
held
on
to
his
for
a
moment
as
he
said
to
see
you
again
mart
before
you
me
die
straight
dope
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
mart
be
good
i
like
you
like
hell
you
he
stood
a
forlorn
figure
in
the
middle
of
the
road
watching
until
martin
turned
a
bend
and
was
gone
from
sight
a
good
indian
that
boy
he
muttered
good
then
he
plodded
down
the
road
himself
to
the
water
tank
where
half
a
dozen
empties
lay
on
a
waiting
for
the
up
freight
chapter
xix
ruth
and
her
family
were
home
again
and
martin
returned
to
oakland
saw
much
of
her
having
gained
her
degree
she
was
doing
no
more
studying
and
he
having
worked
all
vitality
out
of
his
mind
and
body
was
doing
no
writing
this
gave
them
time
for
each
other
that
they
had
never
had
before
and
their
intimacy
ripened
fast
at
first
martin
had
done
nothing
but
rest
he
had
slept
a
great
deal
and
spent
long
hours
musing
and
thinking
and
doing
nothing
he
was
like
one
recovering
from
some
terrible
bout
of
hardship
the
first
signs
of
reawakening
came
when
he
discovered
more
than
languid
interest
in
the
daily
paper
then
he
began
to
read
novels
and
poetry
and
after
several
days
more
he
was
head
over
heels
in
his
fiske
his
splendid
body
and
health
made
new
vitality
and
he
possessed
all
the
resiliency
and
rebound
of
youth
ruth
showed
her
disappointment
plainly
when
he
announced
that
he
was
going
to
sea
for
another
voyage
as
soon
as
he
was
well
rested
do
you
want
to
do
that
she
asked
was
the
answer
have
to
lay
in
a
supply
for
my
next
attack
on
the
editors
money
is
the
sinews
of
war
in
my
and
if
all
you
wanted
was
money
why
you
stay
in
the
laundry
the
laundry
was
making
a
beast
of
me
too
much
work
of
that
sort
drives
to
she
stared
at
him
with
horror
in
her
eyes
you
she
quavered
it
would
have
been
easy
for
him
to
get
out
of
it
but
his
natural
impulse
was
for
frankness
and
he
remembered
his
old
resolve
to
be
frank
no
matter
what
happened
he
answered
that
several
she
shivered
and
drew
away
from
him
man
that
i
have
ever
known
did
did
they
never
worked
in
the
laundry
at
shelly
hot
springs
he
laughed
bitterly
is
a
good
thing
it
is
necessary
for
human
health
so
all
the
preachers
say
and
heaven
knows
never
been
afraid
of
it
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
too
much
of
a
good
thing
and
the
laundry
up
there
is
one
of
them
and
why
going
to
sea
one
more
voyage
it
will
be
my
last
i
think
for
when
i
come
back
i
shall
break
into
the
magazines
i
am
certain
of
she
was
silent
unsympathetic
and
he
watched
her
moodily
realizing
how
impossible
it
was
for
her
to
understand
what
he
had
been
through
day
i
shall
write
it
degradation
of
or
the
of
drink
in
the
or
something
like
that
for
a
never
since
the
first
meeting
had
they
seemed
so
far
apart
as
that
day
his
confession
told
in
frankness
with
the
spirit
of
revolt
behind
had
repelled
her
but
she
was
more
shocked
by
the
repulsion
itself
than
by
the
cause
of
it
it
pointed
out
to
her
how
near
she
had
drawn
to
him
and
once
accepted
it
paved
the
way
for
greater
intimacy
pity
too
was
aroused
and
innocent
idealistic
thoughts
of
reform
she
would
save
this
raw
young
man
who
had
come
so
far
she
would
save
him
from
the
curse
of
his
early
environment
and
she
would
save
him
from
himself
in
spite
of
himself
and
all
this
affected
her
as
a
very
noble
state
of
consciousness
nor
did
she
dream
that
behind
it
and
underlying
it
were
the
jealousy
and
desire
of
love
they
rode
on
their
wheels
much
in
the
delightful
fall
weather
and
out
in
the
hills
they
read
poetry
aloud
now
one
and
now
the
other
noble
uplifting
poetry
that
turned
thoughts
to
higher
things
renunciation
sacrifice
patience
industry
and
high
endeavor
were
the
principles
she
thus
indirectly
abstractions
being
objectified
in
her
mind
by
her
father
and
butler
and
by
andrew
carnegie
who
from
a
poor
immigrant
boy
had
arisen
to
be
the
of
the
world
all
of
which
was
appreciated
and
enjoyed
by
martin
he
followed
her
mental
processes
more
clearly
now
and
her
soul
was
no
longer
the
sealed
wonder
it
had
been
he
was
on
terms
of
intellectual
equality
with
her
but
the
points
of
disagreement
did
not
affect
his
love
his
love
was
more
ardent
than
ever
for
he
loved
her
for
what
she
was
and
even
her
physical
frailty
was
an
added
charm
in
his
eyes
he
read
of
sickly
elizabeth
barrett
who
for
years
had
not
placed
her
feet
upon
the
ground
until
that
day
of
flame
when
she
eloped
with
browning
and
stood
upright
upon
the
earth
under
the
open
sky
and
what
browning
had
done
for
her
martin
decided
he
could
do
for
ruth
but
first
she
must
love
him
the
rest
would
be
easy
he
would
give
her
strength
and
health
and
he
caught
glimpses
of
their
life
in
the
years
to
come
wherein
against
a
background
of
work
and
comfort
and
general
he
saw
himself
and
ruth
reading
and
discussing
poetry
she
propped
amid
a
multitude
of
cushions
on
the
ground
while
she
read
aloud
to
him
this
was
the
key
to
the
life
they
would
live
and
always
he
saw
that
particular
picture
sometimes
it
was
she
who
leaned
against
him
while
he
read
one
arm
about
her
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
sometimes
they
pored
together
over
the
printed
pages
of
beauty
then
too
she
loved
nature
and
with
generous
imagination
he
changed
the
scene
of
their
they
read
in
valleys
with
precipitous
walls
or
in
high
mountain
meadows
and
again
down
by
the
gray
with
a
wreath
of
billows
at
their
feet
or
afar
on
some
volcanic
tropic
isle
where
waterfalls
descended
and
became
mist
reaching
the
sea
in
vapor
veils
that
swayed
and
shivered
to
every
vagrant
wisp
of
wind
but
always
in
the
foreground
lords
of
beauty
and
eternally
reading
and
sharing
lay
he
and
ruth
and
always
in
the
background
that
was
beyond
the
background
of
nature
dim
and
hazy
were
work
and
success
and
money
earned
that
made
them
free
of
the
world
and
all
its
treasures
should
recommend
my
little
girl
to
be
careful
her
mother
warned
her
one
day
know
what
you
mean
but
it
is
impossible
he
is
ruth
was
blushing
but
it
was
the
blush
of
maidenhood
called
upon
for
the
first
time
to
discuss
the
sacred
things
of
life
with
a
mother
held
equally
sacred
her
mother
finished
the
sentence
for
her
ruth
nodded
did
not
want
to
say
it
but
he
is
not
he
is
rough
brutal
strong
he
has
she
hesitated
and
could
not
go
on
it
was
a
new
experience
talking
over
such
matters
with
her
mother
and
again
her
mother
completed
her
thought
for
her
has
not
lived
a
clean
life
is
what
you
wanted
to
again
ruth
nodded
and
again
a
blush
mantled
her
face
is
just
that
she
said
has
not
been
his
fault
but
he
has
played
much
pitch
with
pitch
and
he
frightens
me
sometimes
i
am
positively
in
terror
of
him
when
he
talks
in
that
free
and
easy
way
of
the
things
he
has
if
they
did
not
matter
they
do
matter
they
they
sat
with
their
arms
twined
around
each
other
and
in
the
pause
her
mother
patted
her
hand
and
waited
for
her
to
go
on
i
am
interested
in
him
dreadfully
she
continued
a
way
he
is
my
protégé
then
too
he
is
my
first
boy
not
exactly
friend
rather
protégé
and
friend
combined
sometimes
too
when
he
frightens
me
it
seems
that
he
is
a
bulldog
i
have
taken
for
a
plaything
like
some
of
the
girls
and
he
is
tugging
hard
and
showing
his
teeth
and
threatening
to
break
again
her
mother
waited
interests
me
i
suppose
like
the
bulldog
and
there
is
much
good
in
him
too
but
there
is
much
in
him
that
i
would
not
like
the
other
way
you
see
i
have
been
thinking
he
swears
he
smokes
he
drinks
he
has
fought
with
his
fists
he
has
told
me
so
and
he
likes
it
he
says
so
he
is
all
that
a
man
should
not
man
i
would
want
for
her
voice
sank
very
then
he
is
too
strong
my
prince
must
be
tall
and
slender
and
graceful
bewitching
prince
no
there
is
no
danger
of
my
falling
in
love
with
martin
eden
it
would
be
the
worst
fate
that
could
befall
it
is
not
that
that
i
spoke
about
her
mother
equivocated
you
thought
about
him
he
is
so
ineligible
in
every
way
you
know
and
suppose
he
should
come
to
love
you
he
she
cried
was
to
be
expected
morse
said
gently
could
it
be
otherwise
with
any
one
who
knew
you
hates
me
she
exclaimed
passionately
i
hate
olney
i
feel
always
like
a
cat
when
he
is
around
i
feel
that
i
must
be
nasty
to
him
and
even
when
i
happen
to
feel
that
way
why
nasty
to
me
anyway
but
i
am
happy
with
martin
eden
no
one
ever
loved
me
man
i
mean
in
that
way
and
it
is
sweet
to
be
way
you
know
what
i
mean
mother
dear
it
is
sweet
to
feel
that
you
are
really
and
truly
a
she
buried
her
face
in
her
lap
sobbing
think
i
am
dreadful
i
know
but
i
am
honest
and
i
tell
you
just
how
i
morse
was
strangely
sad
and
happy
her
who
was
a
bachelor
of
arts
was
gone
but
in
her
place
was
a
the
experiment
had
succeeded
the
strange
void
in
nature
had
been
filled
and
filled
without
danger
or
penalty
this
rough
had
been
the
instrument
and
though
ruth
did
not
love
him
he
had
made
her
conscious
of
her
womanhood
hand
trembles
ruth
was
confessing
her
face
for
sake
still
buried
is
most
amusing
and
ridiculous
but
i
feel
sorry
for
him
too
and
when
his
hands
are
too
trembly
and
his
eyes
too
shiny
why
i
lecture
him
about
his
life
and
the
wrong
way
he
is
going
about
it
to
mend
it
but
he
worships
me
i
know
his
eyes
and
his
hands
do
not
lie
and
it
makes
me
feel
the
thought
of
it
the
very
thought
of
it
and
i
feel
that
i
am
possessed
of
something
that
is
by
rights
my
makes
me
like
the
other
young
women
and
then
too
i
knew
that
i
was
not
like
them
before
and
i
knew
that
it
worried
you
you
thought
you
did
not
let
me
know
that
dear
worry
of
yours
but
i
did
and
i
wanted
make
good
as
martin
eden
it
was
a
holy
hour
for
mother
and
daughter
and
their
eyes
were
wet
as
they
talked
on
in
the
twilight
ruth
all
white
innocence
and
frankness
her
mother
sympathetic
receptive
yet
calmly
explaining
and
guiding
is
four
years
younger
than
you
she
said
has
no
place
in
the
world
he
has
neither
position
nor
salary
he
is
impractical
loving
you
he
should
in
the
name
of
common
sense
be
doing
something
that
would
give
him
the
right
to
marry
instead
of
paltering
around
with
those
stories
of
his
and
with
childish
dreams
martin
eden
i
am
afraid
will
never
grow
up
he
does
not
take
to
responsibility
and
a
work
in
the
world
like
your
father
did
or
like
all
our
friends
butler
for
one
martin
eden
i
am
afraid
will
never
be
a
and
this
world
is
so
ordered
that
money
is
necessary
to
no
not
these
swollen
fortunes
but
enough
of
money
to
permit
of
common
comfort
and
decency
has
never
spoken
has
not
breathed
a
word
he
has
not
attempted
to
but
if
he
did
i
would
not
let
him
because
you
see
i
do
not
love
am
glad
of
that
i
should
not
care
to
see
my
daughter
my
one
daughter
who
is
so
clean
and
pure
love
a
man
like
him
there
are
noble
men
in
the
world
who
are
clean
and
true
and
manly

for
them
you
will
find
one
some
day
and

loved
by
him
and
you
will
be
happy
with
him
as
your
father
and
i
have
been
happy
with
each
other
and
there
is
one
thing
you
must
always
carry
in
voice
was
low
and
sweet
as
she
said
that
is
the
thought
about
them
ruth
confessed
remembering
the
wanton
thoughts
that
had
vexed
her
in
the
past
her
face
again
red
with
maiden
shame
that
she
should
be
telling
such
things
it
is
that
the
children
that
makes
eden
impossible
morse
went
on
incisively
heritage
must
be
clean
and
he
is
i
am
afraid
not
clean
your
father
has
told
me
of
lives
you
ruth
pressed
her
hand
in
assent
feeling
that
she
really
did
understand
though
her
conception
was
of
something
vague
remote
and
terrible
that
was
beyond
the
scope
of
imagination
know
i
do
nothing
without
telling
you
she
began
sometimes
you
must
ask
me
like
this
time
i
wanted
to
tell
you
but
i
did
not
know
how
it
is
false
modesty
i
know
it
is
that
but
you
can
make
it
easy
for
me
sometimes
like
this
time
you
must
ask
me
you
must
give
me
a
mother
you
are
a
woman
too
she
cried
exultantly
as
they
stood
up
catching
her
hands
and
standing
erect
facing
her
in
the
twilight
conscious
of
a
strangely
sweet
equality
between
them
should
never
have
thought
of
you
in
that
way
if
we
had
not
had
this
talk
i
had
to
learn
that
i
was
a
woman
to
know
that
you
were
one
are
women
together
her
mother
said
drawing
her
to
her
and
kissing
her
are
women
together
she
repeated
as
they
went
out
of
the
room
their
arms
around
each
waists
their
hearts
swelling
with
a
new
sense
of
companionship
little
girl
has
become
a
woman
morse
said
proudly
to
her
husband
an
hour
later
means
he
said
after
a
long
look
at
his
wife

she
is
in
but
that
she

was
the
smiling
rejoinder
experiment

succeeded

awakened
at

briskly
in
businesslike
tones
but
his

shook
her
head

not
be

days

she
chapter
xx
the
desire
to
write
was
stirring
in
martin
once
more
stories
and
poems
were
springing
into
spontaneous
creation
in
his
brain
and
he
made
notes
of
them
against
the
future
time
when
he
would
give
them
expression
but
he
did
not
write
this
was
his
little
vacation
he
had
resolved
to
devote
it
to
rest
and
love
and
in
both
matters
he
prospered
he
was
soon
spilling
over
with
vitality
and
each
day
he
saw
ruth
at
the
moment
of
meeting
she
experienced
the
old
shock
of
his
strength
and
health
careful
her
mother
warned
her
once
again
am
afraid
you
are
seeing
too
much
of
martin
but
ruth
laughed
from
security
she
was
sure
of
herself
and
in
a
few
days
he
would
be
off
to
sea
then
by
the
time
he
returned
she
would
be
away
on
her
visit
east
there
was
a
magic
however
in
the
strength
and
health
of
martin
he
too
had
been
told
of
her
contemplated
eastern
trip
and
he
felt
the
need
for
haste
yet
he
did
not
know
how
to
make
love
to
a
girl
like
ruth
then
too
he
was
handicapped
by
the
possession
of
a
great
fund
of
experience
with
girls
and
women
who
had
been
absolutely
different
from
her
they
had
known
about
love
and
life
and
flirtation
while
she
knew
nothing
about
such
things
her
prodigious
innocence
appalled
him
freezing
on
his
lips
all
ardors
of
speech
and
convincing
him
in
spite
of
himself
of
his
own
unworthiness
also
he
was
handicapped
in
another
way
he
had
himself
never
been
in
love
before
he
had
liked
women
in
that
turgid
past
of
his
and
been
fascinated
by
some
of
them
but
he
had
not
known
what
it
was
to
love
them
he
had
whistled
in
a
masterful
careless
way
and
they
had
come
to
him
they
had
been
diversions
incidents
part
of
the
game
men
play
but
a
small
part
at
most
and
now
and
for
the
first
time
he
was
a
suppliant
tender
and
timid
and
doubting
he
did
not
know
the
way
of
love
nor
its
speech
while
he
was
frightened
at
his
loved
clear
innocence
in
the
course
of
getting
acquainted
with
a
varied
world
whirling
on
through
the
ever
changing
phases
of
it
he
had
learned
a
rule
of
conduct
which
was
to
the
effect
that
when
one
played
a
strange
game
he
should
let
the
other
fellow
play
first
this
had
stood
him
in
good
stead
a
thousand
times
and
trained
him
as
an
observer
as
well
he
knew
how
to
watch
the
thing
that
was
strange
and
to
wait
for
a
weakness
for
a
place
of
entrance
to
divulge
itself
it
was
like
sparring
for
an
opening
in
and
when
such
an
opening
came
he
knew
by
long
experience
to
play
for
it
and
to
play
hard
so
he
waited
with
ruth
and
watched
desiring
to
speak
his
love
but
not
daring
he
was
afraid
of
shocking
her
and
he
was
not
sure
of
himself
had
he
but
known
it
he
was
following
the
right
course
with
her
love
came
into
the
world
before
articulate
speech
and
in
its
own
early
youth
it
had
learned
ways
and
means
that
it
had
never
forgotten
it
was
in
this
old
primitive
way
that
martin
wooed
ruth
he
did
not
know
he
was
doing
it
at
first
though
later
he
divined
it
the
touch
of
his
hand
on
hers
was
vastly
more
potent
than
any
word
he
could
utter
the
impact
of
his
strength
on
her
imagination
was
more
alluring
than
the
printed
poems
and
spoken
passions
of
a
thousand
generations
of
lovers
whatever
his
tongue
could
express
would
have
appealed
in
part
to
her
judgment
but
the
touch
of
hand
the
fleeting
contact
made
its
way
directly
to
her
instinct
her
judgment
was
as
young
as
she
but
her
instincts
were
as
old
as
the
race
and
older
they
had
been
young
when
love
was
young
and
they
were
wiser
than
convention
and
opinion
and
all
the
things
so
her
judgment
did
not
act
there
was
no
call
upon
it
and
she
did
not
realize
the
strength
of
the
appeal
martin
made
from
moment
to
moment
to
her
that
he
loved
her
on
the
other
hand
was
as
clear
as
day
and
she
consciously
delighted
in
beholding
his
glowing
eyes
with
their
tender
lights
the
trembling
hands
and
the
never
failing
swarthy
flush
that
flooded
darkly
under
his
sunburn
she
even
went
farther
in
a
timid
way
inciting
him
but
doing
it
so
delicately
that
he
never
suspected
and
doing
it
so
that
she
scarcely
suspected
herself
she
thrilled
with
these
proofs
of
her
power
that
proclaimed
her
a
woman
and
she
took
an
delight
in
tormenting
him
and
playing
upon
him
by
inexperience
and
by
excess
of
ardor
wooing
unwittingly
and
awkwardly
martin
continued
his
approach
by
contact
the
touch
of
his
hand
was
pleasant
to
her
and
something
deliciously
more
than
pleasant
martin
did
not
know
it
but
he
did
know
that
it
was
not
distasteful
to
her
not
that
they
touched
hands
often
save
at
meeting
and
parting
but
that
in
handling
the
bicycles
in
strapping
on
the
books
of
verse
they
carried
into
the
hills
and
in
conning
the
pages
of
books
side
by
side
there
were
opportunities
for
hand
to
stray
against
hand
and
there
were
opportunities
too
for
her
hair
to
brush
his
cheek
and
for
shoulder
to
touch
shoulder
as
they
leaned
together
over
the
beauty
of
the
books
she
smiled
to
herself
at
vagrant
impulses
which
arose
from
nowhere
and
suggested
that
she
rumple
his
hair
while
he
desired
greatly
when
they
tired
of
reading
to
rest
his
head
in
her
lap
and
dream
with
closed
eyes
about
the
future
that
was
to
be
theirs
on
sunday
picnics
at
shellmound
park
and
schuetzen
park
in
the
past
he
had
rested
his
head
on
many
laps
and
usually
he
had
slept
soundly
and
selfishly
while
the
girls
shaded
his
face
from
the
sun
and
looked
down
and
loved
him
and
wondered
at
his
lordly
carelessness
of
their
love
to
rest
his
head
in
a
lap
had
been
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
until
now
and
now
he
found
lap
inaccessible
and
impossible
yet
it
was
right
here
in
his
reticence
that
the
strength
of
his
wooing
lay
it
was
because
of
this
reticence
that
he
never
alarmed
her
herself
fastidious
and
timid
she
never
awakened
to
the
perilous
trend
of
their
intercourse
subtly
and
unaware
she
grew
toward
him
and
closer
to
him
while
he
sensing
the
growing
closeness
longed
to
dare
but
was
afraid
once
he
dared
one
afternoon
when
he
found
her
in
the
darkened
living
room
with
a
blinding
headache
can
do
it
any
good
she
had
answered
his
inquiries
besides
i
take
headache
powders
doctor
hall
permit
can
cure
it
i
think
and
without
drugs
was
answer
am
not
sure
of
course
but
like
to
try
simply
massage
i
learned
the
trick
first
from
the
japanese
they
are
a
race
of
masseurs
you
know
then
i
learned
it
all
over
again
with
variations
from
the
hawaiians
they
call
it
it
can
accomplish
most
of
the
things
drugs
accomplish
and
a
few
things
that
drugs
scarcely
had
his
hands
touched
her
head
when
she
sighed
deeply
is
so
good
she
said
she
spoke
once
again
half
an
hour
later
when
she
asked
you
tired
the
question
was
perfunctory
and
she
knew
what
the
answer
would
be
then
she
lost
herself
in
drowsy
contemplation
of
the
soothing
balm
of
his
strength
life
poured
from
the
ends
of
his
fingers
driving
the
pain
before
it
or
so
it
seemed
to
her
until
with
the
easement
of
pain
she
fell
asleep
and
he
stole
away
she
called
him
up
by
telephone
that
evening
to
thank
him
slept
until
dinner
she
said
cured
me
completely
eden
and
i
know
how
to
thank
he
was
warm
and
bungling
of
speech
and
very
happy
as
he
replied
to
her
and
there
was
dancing
in
his
mind
throughout
the
telephone
conversation
the
memory
of
browning
and
of
sickly
elizabeth
barrett
what
had
been
done
could
be
done
again
and
he
martin
eden
could
do
it
and
would
do
it
for
ruth
morse
he
went
back
to
his
room
and
to
the
volume
of
lying
open
on
the
bed
but
he
could
not
read
love
tormented
him
and
overrode
his
will
so
that
despite
all
determination
he
found
himself
at
the
little
table
the
sonnet
he
composed
that
night
was
the
first
of
a
of
fifty
sonnets
which
was
completed
within
two
months
he
had
the
from
the
in
mind
as
he
wrote
and
he
wrote
under
the
best
conditions
for
great
work
at
a
climacteric
of
living
in
the
throes
of
his
own
sweet
the
many
hours
he
was
not
with
ruth
he
devoted
to
the
to
reading
at
home
or
to
the
public
where
he
got
more
closely
in
touch
with
the
magazines
of
the
day
and
the
nature
of
their
policy
and
content
the
hours
he
spent
with
ruth
were
maddening
alike
in
promise
and
in
inconclusiveness
it
was
a
week
after
he
cured
her
headache
that
a
moonlight
sail
on
lake
merritt
was
proposed
by
norman
and
seconded
by
arthur
and
olney
martin
was
the
only
one
capable
of
handling
a
boat
and
he
was
pressed
into
service
ruth
sat
near
him
in
the
stern
while
the
three
young
fellows
lounged
amidships
deep
in
a
wordy
wrangle
over
affairs
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
and
ruth
gazing
into
the
starry
vault
of
the
sky
and
exchanging
no
speech
with
martin
experienced
a
sudden
feeling
of
loneliness
she
glanced
at
him
a
puff
of
wind
was
heeling
the
boat
over
till
the
deck
was
awash
and
he
one
hand
on
tiller
and
the
other
on
was
luffing
slightly
at
the
same
time
peering
ahead
to
make
out
the
north
shore
he
was
unaware
of
her
gaze
and
she
watched
him
intently
speculating
fancifully
about
the
strange
warp
of
soul
that
led
him
a
young
man
with
signal
powers
to
fritter
away
his
time
on
the
writing
of
stories
and
poems
foredoomed
to
mediocrity
and
failure
her
eyes
wandered
along
the
strong
throat
dimly
seen
in
the
starlight
and
over
the
head
and
the
old
desire
to
lay
her
hands
upon
his
neck
came
back
to
her
the
strength
she
abhorred
attracted
her
her
feeling
of
loneliness
became
more
pronounced
and
she
felt
tired
her
position
on
the
heeling
boat
irked
her
and
she
remembered
the
headache
he
had
cured
and
the
soothing
rest
that
resided
in
him
he
was
sitting
beside
her
quite
beside
her
and
the
boat
seemed
to
tilt
her
toward
him
then
arose
in
her
the
impulse
to
lean
against
him
to
rest
herself
against
his
vague
impulse
which
even
as
she
considered
it
mastered
her
and
made
her
lean
toward
him
or
was
it
the
heeling
of
the
boat
she
did
not
know
she
never
knew
she
knew
only
that
she
was
leaning
against
him
and
that
the
easement
and
soothing
rest
were
very
good
perhaps
it
had
been
the
fault
but
she
made
no
effort
to
retrieve
it
she
leaned
lightly
against
his
shoulder
but
she
leaned
and
she
continued
to
lean
when
he
shifted
his
position
to
make
it
more
comfortable
for
her
it
was
a
madness
but
she
refused
to
consider
the
madness
she
was
no
longer
herself
but
a
woman
with
a
clinging
need
and
though
she
leaned
ever
so
lightly
the
need
seemed
satisfied
she
was
no
longer
tired
martin
did
not
speak
had
he
the
spell
would
have
been
broken
but
his
reticence
of
love
prolonged
it
he
was
dazed
and
dizzy
he
could
not
understand
what
was
happening
it
was
too
wonderful
to
be
anything
but
a
delirium
he
conquered
a
mad
desire
to
let
go
sheet
and
tiller
and
to
clasp
her
in
his
arms
his
intuition
told
him
it
was
the
wrong
thing
to
do
and
he
was
glad
that
sheet
and
tiller
kept
his
hands
occupied
and
fended
off
temptation
but
he
luffed
the
boat
less
delicately
spilling
the
wind
shamelessly
from
the
sail
so
as
to
prolong
the
tack
to
the
north
shore
the
shore
would
compel
him
to
go
about
and
the
contact
would
be
broken
he
sailed
with
skill
stopping
way
on
the
boat
without
exciting
the
notice
of
the
wranglers
and
mentally
forgiving
his
hardest
voyages
in
that
they
had
made
this
marvellous
night
possible
giving
him
mastery
over
sea
and
boat
and
wind
so
that
he
could
sail
with
her
beside
him
her
dear
weight
against
him
on
his
shoulder
when
the
first
light
of
the
rising
moon
touched
the
sail
illuminating
the
boat
with
pearly
radiance
ruth
moved
away
from
him
and
even
as
she
moved
she
felt
him
move
away
the
impulse
to
avoid
detection
was
mutual
the
episode
was
tacitly
and
secretly
intimate
she
sat
apart
from
him
with
burning
cheeks
while
the
full
force
of
it
came
home
to
her
she
had
been
guilty
of
something
she
would
not
have
her
brothers
see
nor
olney
see
why
had
she
done
it
she
had
never
done
anything
like
it
in
her
life
and
yet
she
had
been
with
young
men
before
she
had
never
desired
to
do
anything
like
it
she
was
overcome
with
shame
and
with
the
mystery
of
her
own
burgeoning
womanhood
she
stole
a
glance
at
martin
who
was
busy
putting
the
boat
about
on
the
other
tack
and
she
could
have
hated
him
for
having
made
her
do
an
immodest
and
shameful
thing
and
he
of
all
men
perhaps
her
mother
was
right
and
she
was
seeing
too
much
of
him
it
would
never
happen
again
she
resolved
and
she
would
see
less
of
him
in
the
future
she
entertained
a
wild
idea
of
explaining
to
him
the
first
time
they
were
alone
together
of
lying
to
him
of
mentioning
casually
the
attack
of
faintness
that
had
overpowered
her
just
before
the
moon
came
up
then
she
remembered
how
they
had
drawn
mutually
away
before
the
revealing
moon
and
she
knew
he
would
know
it
for
a
lie
in
the
days
that
swiftly
followed
she
was
no
longer
herself
but
a
strange
puzzling
creature
wilful
over
judgment
and
scornful
of
refusing
to
peer
into
the
future
or
to
think
about
herself
and
whither
she
was
drifting
she
was
in
a
fever
of
tingling
mystery
alternately
frightened
and
charmed
and
in
constant
bewilderment
she
had
one
idea
firmly
fixed
however
which
insured
her
security
she
would
not
let
martin
speak
his
love
as
long
as
she
did
this
all
would
be
well
in
a
few
days
he
would
be
off
to
sea
and
even
if
he
did
speak
all
would
be
well
it
could
not
be
otherwise
for
she
did
not
love
him
of
course
it
would
be
a
painful
half
hour
for
him
and
an
embarrassing
half
hour
for
her
because
it
would
be
her
first
proposal
she
thrilled
deliciously
at
the
thought
she
was
really
a
woman
with
a
man
ripe
to
ask
for
her
in
marriage
it
was
a
lure
to
all
that
was
fundamental
in
her
sex
the
fabric
of
her
life
of
all
that
constituted
her
quivered
and
grew
tremulous
the
thought
fluttered
in
her
mind
like
a
moth
she
went
so
far
as
to
imagine
martin
proposing
herself
putting
the
words
into
his
mouth
and
she
rehearsed
her
refusal
tempering
it
with
kindness
and
exhorting
him
to
true
and
noble
manhood
and
especially
he
must
stop
smoking
cigarettes
she
would
make
a
point
of
that
but
no
she
must
not
let
him
speak
at
all
she
could
stop
him
and
she
had
told
her
mother
that
she
would
all
flushed
and
burning
she
regretfully
dismissed
the
conjured
situation
her
first
proposal
would
have
to
be
deferred
to
a
more
propitious
time
and
a
more
eligible
suitor
chapter
xxi
came
a
beautiful
fall
day
warm
and
languid
palpitant
with
the
hush
of
the
changing
season
a
california
indian
summer
day
with
hazy
sun
and
wandering
wisps
of
breeze
that
did
not
stir
the
slumber
of
the
air
filmy
purple
mists
that
were
not
vapors
but
fabrics
woven
of
color
hid
in
the
recesses
of
the
hills
san
francisco
lay
like
a
blur
of
smoke
upon
her
heights
the
intervening
bay
was
a
dull
sheen
of
molten
metal
whereon
sailing
craft
lay
motionless
or
drifted
with
the
lazy
tide
far
tamalpais
barely
seen
in
the
silver
haze
bulked
hugely
by
the
golden
gate
the
latter
a
pale
gold
pathway
under
the
westering
sun
beyond
the
pacific
dim
and
vast
was
raising
on
its
tumbled
that
swept
landward
giving
warning
of
the
first
blustering
breath
of
winter
the
erasure
of
summer
was
at
hand
yet
summer
lingered
fading
and
fainting
among
her
hills
deepening
the
purple
of
her
valleys
spinning
a
shroud
of
haze
from
waning
powers
and
sated
raptures
dying
with
the
calm
content
of
having
lived
and
lived
well
and
among
the
hills
on
their
favorite
knoll
martin
and
ruth
sat
side
by
side
their
heads
bent
over
the
same
pages
he
reading
aloud
from
the
of
the
woman
who
had
loved
browning
as
it
is
given
to
few
men
to
be
loved
but
the
reading
languished
the
spell
of
passing
beauty
all
about
them
was
too
strong
the
golden
year
was
dying
as
it
had
lived
a
beautiful
and
unrepentant
voluptuary
and
reminiscent
rapture
and
content
freighted
heavily
the
air
it
entered
into
them
dreamy
and
languorous
weakening
the
fibres
of
resolution
suffusing
the
face
of
morality
or
of
judgment
with
haze
and
purple
mist
martin
felt
tender
and
melting
and
from
time
to
time
warm
glows
passed
over
him
his
head
was
very
near
to
hers
and
when
wandering
phantoms
of
breeze
stirred
her
hair
so
that
it
touched
his
face
the
printed
pages
swam
before
his
eyes
believe
you
know
a
word
of
what
you
are
reading
she
said
once
when
he
had
lost
his
place
he
looked
at
her
with
burning
eyes
and
was
on
the
verge
of
becoming
awkward
when
a
retort
came
to
his
lips
believe
you
know
either
what
was
the
last
sonnet
about
know
she
laughed
frankly
already
forgotten
let
us
read
any
more
the
day
is
too
will
be
our
last
in
the
hills
for
some
time
he
announced
gravely
a
storm
gathering
out
there
on
the
the
book
slipped
from
his
hands
to
the
ground
and
they
sat
idly
and
silently
gazing
out
over
the
dreamy
bay
with
eyes
that
dreamed
and
did
not
see
ruth
glanced
sidewise
at
his
neck
she
did
not
lean
toward
him
she
was
drawn
by
some
force
outside
of
herself
and
stronger
than
gravitation
strong
as
destiny
it
was
only
an
inch
to
lean
and
it
was
accomplished
without
volition
on
her
part
her
shoulder
touched
his
as
lightly
as
a
butterfly
touches
a
flower
and
just
as
lightly
was
the
she
felt
his
shoulder
press
hers
and
a
tremor
run
through
him
then
was
the
time
for
her
to
draw
back
but
she
had
become
an
automaton
her
actions
had
passed
beyond
the
control
of
her
never
thought
of
control
or
will
in
the
delicious
madness
that
was
upon
her
his
arm
began
to
steal
behind
her
and
around
her
she
waited
its
slow
progress
in
a
torment
of
delight
she
waited
she
knew
not
for
what
panting
with
dry
burning
lips
a
leaping
pulse
and
a
fever
of
expectancy
in
all
her
blood
the
girdling
arm
lifted
higher
and
drew
her
toward
him
drew
her
slowly
and
caressingly
she
could
wait
no
longer
with
a
tired
sigh
and
with
an
impulsive
movement
all
her
own
unpremeditated
spasmodic
she
rested
her
head
upon
his
breast
his
head
bent
over
swiftly
and
as
his
lips
approached
hers
flew
to
meet
them
this
must
be
love
she
thought
in
the
one
rational
moment
that
was
vouchsafed
her
if
it
was
not
love
it
was
too
shameful
it
could
be
nothing
else
than
love
she
loved
the
man
whose
arms
were
around
her
and
whose
lips
were
pressed
to
hers
she
pressed
more
tightly
to
him
with
a
snuggling
movement
of
her
body
and
a
moment
later
tearing
herself
half
out
of
his
embrace
suddenly
and
exultantly
she
reached
up
and
placed
both
hands
upon
martin
sunburnt
neck
so
exquisite
was
the
pang
of
love
and
desire
fulfilled
that
she
uttered
a
low
moan
relaxed
her
hands
and
lay
in
his
arms
not
a
word
had
been
spoken
and
not
a
word
was
spoken
for
a
long
time
twice
he
bent
and
kissed
her
and
each
time
her
lips
met
his
shyly
and
her
body
made
its
happy
nestling
movement
she
clung
to
him
unable
to
release
herself
and
he
sat
half
supporting
her
in
his
arms
as
he
gazed
with
unseeing
eyes
at
the
blur
of
the
great
city
across
the
bay
for
once
there
were
no
visions
in
his
brain
only
colors
and
lights
and
glows
pulsed
there
warm
as
the
day
and
warm
as
his
love
he
bent
over
her
she
was
speaking
did
you
love
me
she
whispered
the
first
the
very
first
the
first
moment
i
laid
eye
on
you
i
was
mad
for
love
of
you
then
and
in
all
the
time
that
has
passed
since
then
i
have
only
grown
the
madder
i
am
maddest
now
dear
i
am
almost
a
lunatic
my
head
is
so
turned
with
am
glad
i
am
a
woman
she
said
after
a
long
sigh
he
crushed
her
in
his
arms
again
and
again
and
then
asked
you
when
did
you
first
know
i
knew
it
all
the
time
almost
from
the
i
have
been
as
blind
as
a
bat
he
cried
a
ring
of
vexation
in
his
voice
never
dreamed
it
until
just
how
when
i
kissed
mean
she
drew
herself
partly
away
and
looked
at
him
meant
i
knew
you
loved
almost
from
the
you
he
demanded
came
to
me
she
was
speaking
very
slowly
her
eyes
warm
and
fluttery
and
melting
a
soft
flush
on
her
cheeks
that
did
not
go
away
never
knew
until
just
now
put
your
arms
around
me
and
i
never
expected
to
marry
you
martin
not
until
just
now
how
did
you
make
me
love
you
know
he
laughed
just
by
loving
you
for
i
loved
you
hard
enough
to
melt
the
heart
of
a
stone
much
less
the
heart
of
the
living
breathing
woman
you
is
so
different
from
what
i
thought
love
would
be
she
announced
irrelevantly
did
you
think
it
would
be
like
think
it
would
be
like
she
was
looking
into
his
eyes
at
the
moment
but
her
own
dropped
as
she
continued
see
i
know
what
this
was
he
offered
to
draw
her
toward
him
again
but
it
was
no
more
than
a
tentative
muscular
movement
of
the
girdling
arm
for
he
feared
that
he
might
be
greedy
then
he
felt
her
body
yielding
and
once
again
she
was
close
in
his
arms
and
lips
were
pressed
on
lips
will
my
people
say
she
queried
with
sudden
apprehension
in
one
of
the
pauses
know
we
can
find
out
very
easily
any
time
we
are
so
if
mamma
objects
i
am
sure
i
am
afraid
to
tell
me
tell
her
he
volunteered
valiantly
think
your
mother
does
not
like
me
but
i
can
win
her
around
a
fellow
who
can
win
you
can
win
anything
and
if
we
have
each
other
but
no
danger
not
winning
your
mother
to
our
marriage
she
loves
you
too
should
not
like
to
break
her
heart
ruth
said
pensively
he
felt
like
assuring
her
that
hearts
were
not
so
easily
broken
but
instead
he
said
love
is
the
greatest
thing
in
the
you
know
martin
you
sometimes
frighten
me
i
am
frightened
now
when
i
think
of
you
and
of
what
you
have
been
you
must
be
very
very
good
to
me
remember
after
all
that
i
am
only
a
child
i
never
loved
i
we
are
both
children
together
and
we
are
fortunate
above
most
for
we
have
found
our
first
love
in
each
that
is
impossible
she
cried
withdrawing
herself
from
his
arms
with
a
swift
passionate
movement
for
you
you
have
been
a
sailor
and
sailors
i
have
heard
her
voice
faltered
and
died
away
addicted
to
having
a
wife
in
every
port
he
suggested
that
what
you
mean
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
that
is
not
he
spoke
authoritatively
have
been
in
many
ports
but
i
never
knew
a
passing
touch
of
love
until
i
saw
you
that
first
night
do
you
know
when
i
said
good
night
and
went
away
i
was
almost
the
policeman
thought
i
was
drunk
and
i
was
love
for
you
said
we
were
children
and
i
said
it
was
impossible
for
you
and
we
have
strayed
away
from
the
said
that
i
never
loved
anybody
but
you
he
replied
are
my
first
my
very
yet
you
have
been
a
sailor
she
objected
that
prevent
me
from
loving
you
the
there
have
been
and
to
martin
supreme
surprise
she
burst
into
a
storm
of
tears
that
took
more
kisses
than
one
and
many
caresses
to
drive
away
and
all
the
while
there
was
running
through
his
head
line
the
lady
and
judy
are
sisters
under
their
it
was
true
he
decided
though
the
novels
he
had
read
had
led
him
to
believe
otherwise
his
idea
for
which
the
novels
were
responsible
had
been
that
only
formal
proposals
obtained
in
the
upper
classes
it
was
all
right
enough
down
whence
he
had
come
for
youths
and
maidens
to
win
each
other
by
contact
but
for
the
exalted
personages
up
above
on
the
heights
to
make
love
in
similar
fashion
had
seemed
unthinkable
yet
the
novels
were
wrong
here
was
a
proof
of
it
the
same
pressures
and
caresses
unaccompanied
by
speech
that
were
efficacious
with
the
girls
of
the
were
equally
efficacious
with
the
girls
above
the
they
were
all
of
the
same
flesh
after
all
sisters
under
their
skins
and
he
might
have
known
as
much
himself
had
he
remembered
his
spencer
as
he
held
ruth
in
his
arms
and
soothed
her
he
took
great
consolation
in
the
thought
that
the
lady
and
judy
were
pretty
much
alike
under
their
skins
it
brought
ruth
closer
to
him
made
her
possible
her
dear
flesh
was
as
flesh
as
his
flesh
there
was
no
bar
to
their
marriage
class
difference
was
the
only
difference
and
class
was
extrinsic
it
could
be
shaken
off
a
slave
he
had
read
had
risen
to
the
roman
purple
that
being
so
then
he
could
rise
to
ruth
under
her
purity
and
saintliness
and
culture
and
ethereal
beauty
of
soul
she
was
in
things
fundamentally
human
just
like
lizzie
connolly
and
all
lizzie
connollys
all
that
was
possible
of
them
was
possible
of
her
she
could
love
and
hate
maybe
have
hysterics
and
she
could
certainly
be
jealous
as
she
was
jealous
now
uttering
her
last
sobs
in
his
arms
i
am
older
than
you
she
remarked
suddenly
opening
her
eyes
and
looking
up
at
him
years
you
are
only
a
child
and
i
am
forty
years
older
than
you
in
experience
was
his
answer
in
truth
they
were
children
together
so
far
as
love
was
concerned
and
they
were
as
naive
and
immature
in
the
expression
of
their
love
as
a
pair
of
children
and
this
despite
the
fact
that
she
was
crammed
with
a
university
education
and
that
his
head
was
full
of
scientific
philosophy
and
the
hard
facts
of
life
they
sat
on
through
the
passing
glory
of
the
day
talking
as
lovers
are
prone
to
talk
marvelling
at
the
wonder
of
love
and
at
destiny
that
had
flung
them
so
strangely
together
and
dogmatically
believing
that
they
loved
to
a
degree
never
attained
by
lovers
before
and
they
returned
insistently
again
and
again
to
a
rehearsal
of
their
first
impressions
of
each
other
and
to
hopeless
attempts
to
analyze
just
precisely
what
they
felt
for
each
other
and
how
much
there
was
of
it
the
on
the
western
horizon
received
the
descending
sun
and
the
circle
of
the
sky
turned
to
rose
while
the
zenith
glowed
with
the
same
warm
color
the
rosy
light
was
all
about
them
flooding
over
them
as
she
sang
sweet
she
sang
softly
leaning
in
the
cradle
of
his
arm
her
hands
in
his
their
hearts
in
each
hands

morse
laughed
with
incredulous
vexation
he
speak
ruth
explained
just
loved
me
that
was
all
i
was
as
surprised
as
you
are
he
say
a
word
he
just
put
his
arm
around
me
i
was
not
myself
and
he
kissed
me
and
i
kissed
him
i
help
it
i
just
had
to
and
then
i
knew
i
loved
she
paused
waiting
with
expectancy
the
benediction
of
her
kiss
but
morse
was
coldly
silent
is
a
dreadful
accident
i
know
ruth
recommenced
with
a
sinking
voice
i
know
how
you
will
ever
forgive
me
but
i
help
it
i
did
not
dream
that
i
loved
him
until
that
moment
and
you
must
tell
father
for
it
not
be
better
not
to
tell
your
father
let
me
see
martin
eden
and
talk
with
him
and
explain
he
will
understand
and
release
no
ruth
cried
starting
up
do
not
want
to
be
released
i
love
him
and
love
is
very
sweet
i
am
going
to
marry
course
if
you
will
let
have
other
plans
for
you
ruth
dear
your
father
and
no
no
no
man
picked
out
for
you
or
anything
like
that
our
plans
go
no
farther
than
your
marrying
some
man
in
your
own
station
in
life
a
good
and
honorable
gentleman
whom
you
will
select
yourself
when
you
love
i
love
martin
already
was
the
plaintive
protest
would
not
influence
your
choice
in
any
way
but
you
are
our
daughter
and
we
could
not
bear
to
see
you
make
a
marriage
such
as
this
he
has
nothing
but
roughness
and
coarseness
to
offer
you
in
exchange
for
all
that
is
refined
and
delicate
in
you
he
is
no
match
for
you
in
any
way
he
could
not
support
you
we
have
no
foolish
ideas
about
wealth
but
comfort
is
another
matter
and
our
daughter
should
at
least
marry
a
man
who
can
give
her
not
a
penniless
adventurer
a
sailor
a
cowboy
a
smuggler
and
heaven
knows
what
else
who
in
addition
to
everything
is
and
ruth
was
silent
every
word
she
recognized
as
true
wastes
his
time
over
his
writing
trying
to
accomplish
what
geniuses
and
rare
men
with
college
educations
sometimes
accomplish
a
man
thinking
of
marriage
should
be
preparing
for
marriage
but
not
he
as
i
have
said
and
i
know
you
agree
with
me
he
is
irresponsible
and
why
should
he
not
be
it
is
the
way
of
sailors
he
has
never
learned
to
be
economical
or
temperate
the
spendthrift
years
have
marked
him
it
is
not
his
fault
of
course
but
that
does
not
alter
his
nature
and
have
you
thought
of
the
years
of
licentiousness
he
inevitably
has
lived
have
you
thought
of
that
daughter
you
know
what
marriage
ruth
shuddered
and
clung
close
to
her
mother
have
ruth
waited
a
long
time
for
the
thought
to
frame
itself
it
is
terrible
it
sickens
me
to
think
of
it
i
told
you
it
was
a
dreadful
accident
my
loving
him
but
i
help
myself
could
you
help
loving
father
then
it
is
the
same
with
me
there
is
something
in
me
in
never
knew
it
was
there
until
it
is
there
and
it
makes
me
love
him
i
never
thought
to
love
him
but
you
see
i
do
she
concluded
a
certain
faint
triumph
in
her
voice
they
talked
long
and
to
little
purpose
in
conclusion
agreeing
to
wait
an
indeterminate
time
without
doing
anything
the
same
conclusion
was
reached
a
little
later
that
night
between
morse
and
her
husband
after
she
had
made
due
confession
of
the
miscarriage
of
her
plans
could
hardly
have
come
otherwise
was
judgment
has
been
the
only
man
she
was
in
touch
with
sooner
or
later
she
was
going
to
awaken
anyway
and
she
did
awaken
and
lo
here
was
this
the
only
accessible
man
at
the
moment
and
of
course
she
promptly
loved
him
or
thought
she
did
which
amounts
to
the
same
morse
took
it
upon
herself
to
work
slowly
and
indirectly
upon
ruth
rather
than
to
combat
her
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
for
this
for
martin
was
not
in
position
to
marry
her
see
all
she
wants
of
him
was
advice
more
she
knows
him
the
less
love
him
i
wager
and
give
her
plenty
of
contrast
make
a
point
of
having
young
people
at
the
house
young
women
and
young
men
all
sorts
of
young
men
clever
men
men
who
have
done
something
or
who
are
doing
things
men
of
her
own
class
gentlemen
she
can
gauge
him
by
them
they
will
show
him
up
for
what
he
is
and
after
all
he
is
a
mere
boy
of
ruth
is
no
more
than
a
child
it
is
calf
love
with
the
pair
of
them
and
they
will
grow
out
of
so
the
matter
rested
within
the
family
it
was
accepted
that
ruth
and
martin
were
engaged
but
no
announcement
was
made
the
family
did
not
think
it
would
ever
be
necessary
also
it
was
tacitly
understood
that
it
was
to
be
a
long
engagement
they
did
not
ask
martin
to
go
to
work
nor
to
cease
writing
they
did
not
intend
to
encourage
him
to
mend
himself
and
he
aided
and
abetted
them
in
their
unfriendly
designs
for
going
to
work
was
farthest
from
his
thoughts
wonder
if
like
what
i
have
done
he
said
to
ruth
several
days
later
decided
that
boarding
with
my
sister
is
too
expensive
and
i
am
going
to
board
myself
rented
a
little
room
out
in
north
oakland
retired
neighborhood
and
all
the
rest
you
know
and
bought
an
on
which
to
ruth
was
overjoyed
the
especially
pleased
her
was
the
way
butler
began
his
start
she
said
martin
frowned
inwardly
at
the
citation
of
that
worthy
gentleman
and
went
on
put
stamps
on
all
my
manuscripts
and
started
them
off
to
the
editors
again
then
i
moved
in
and
i
start
to
position
she
cried
betraying
the
gladness
of
her
surprise
in
all
her
body
nestling
closer
to
him
pressing
his
hand
smiling
you
never
told
me
what
is
it
he
shook
his
head
meant
that
i
was
going
to
work
at
my
her
face
fell
and
he
went
on
hastily
misjudge
me
i
am
not
going
in
this
time
with
any
iridescent
ideas
it
is
to
be
a
cold
prosaic
business
proposition
it
is
better
than
going
to
sea
again
and
i
shall
earn
more
money
than
any
position
in
oakland
can
bring
an
unskilled
see
this
vacation
i
have
taken
has
given
me
perspective
i
been
working
the
life
out
of
my
body
and
i
been
writing
at
least
not
for
publication
all
done
has
been
to
love
you
and
to
think
read
some
too
but
it
has
been
part
of
my
thinking
and
i
have
read
principally
magazines
i
have
generalized
about
myself
and
the
world
my
place
in
it
and
my
chance
to
win
to
a
place
that
will
be
fit
for
you
also
been
reading
of
style
and
found
out
a
lot
of
what
was
the
matter
with
my
writing
rather
and
for
that
matter
with
most
of
the
writing
that
is
published
every
month
in
the
the
upshot
of
it
my
thinking
and
reading
and
that
i
am
going
to
move
to
grub
street
i
shall
leave
masterpieces
alone
and
do
paragraphs
feature
articles
humorous
verse
and
society
the
rot
for
which
there
seems
so
much
demand
then
there
are
the
newspaper
syndicates
and
the
newspaper
syndicates
and
the
syndicates
for
the
sunday
supplements
i
can
go
ahead
and
hammer
out
the
stuff
they
want
and
earn
the
equivalent
of
a
good
salary
by
it
there
are
you
know
who
earn
as
much
as
four
or
five
hundred
a
month
i
care
to
become
as
they
but
earn
a
good
living
and
have
plenty
of
time
to
myself
which
i
have
in
any
have
my
spare
time
for
study
and
for
real
work
in
between
the
grind
try
my
hand
at
masterpieces
and
study
and
prepare
myself
for
the
writing
of
masterpieces
why
i
am
amazed
at
the
distance
i
have
come
already
when
i
first
tried
to
write
i
had
nothing
to
write
about
except
a
few
paltry
experiences
which
i
neither
understood
nor
appreciated
but
i
had
no
thoughts
i
really
i
even
have
the
words
with
which
to
think
my
experiences
were
so
many
meaningless
pictures
but
as
i
began
to
add
to
my
knowledge
and
to
my
vocabulary
i
saw
something
more
in
my
experiences
than
mere
pictures
i
retained
the
pictures
and
i
found
their
interpretation
that
was
when
i
began
to
do
good
work
when
i
wrote
pot
wine
of
life
jostling
street
the
and
the
i
shall
write
more
like
them
and
better
but
i
shall
do
it
in
my
spare
time
my
feet
are
on
the
solid
earth
now
and
income
first
masterpieces
afterward
just
to
show
you
i
wrote
half
a
dozen
jokes
last
night
for
the
comic
weeklies
and
just
as
i
was
going
to
bed
the
thought
struck
me
to
try
my
hand
at
a
humorous
one
and
inside
an
hour
i
had
written
four
they
ought
to
be
worth
a
dollar
apiece
four
dollars
right
there
for
a
few
afterthoughts
on
the
way
to
course
all
valueless
just
so
much
dull
and
sordid
plodding
but
it
is
no
more
dull
and
sordid
than
keeping
books
at
sixty
dollars
a
month
adding
up
endless
columns
of
meaningless
figures
until
one
dies
and
furthermore
the
keeps
me
in
touch
with
things
literary
and
gives
me
time
to
try
bigger
what
good
are
these
bigger
things
these
masterpieces
ruth
demanded
sell
yes
i
can
he
began
but
she
interrupted
those
you
named
and
which
you
say
yourself
are
have
not
sold
any
of
them
we
get
married
on
masterpieces
that
get
married
on
triolets
that
will
sell
he
asserted
stoutly
putting
his
arm
around
her
and
drawing
a
very
unresponsive
sweetheart
toward
him
to
this
he
went
on
in
attempted
gayety
not
art
but
a
dollar
came
in
when
i
was
out
to
borrow
some
tin
was
why
he
came
in
and
he
went
without
so
i
was
in
and
he
was
the
merry
lilt
with
which
he
had
invested
the
jingle
was
at
variance
with
the
dejection
that
came
into
his
face
as
he
finished
he
had
drawn
no
smile
from
ruth
she
was
looking
at
him
in
an
earnest
and
troubled
way
may
be
a
dollar
she
said
it
is
a
dollar
the
fee
of
a
clown
you
see
martin
the
whole
thing
is
lowering
i
want
the
man
i
love
and
honor
to
be
something
finer
and
higher
than
a
perpetrator
of
jokes
and
want
him
to
be
butler
he
suggested
know
you
like
butler
she
began
all
right
he
interrupted
only
his
indigestion
i
find
fault
with
but
to
save
me
i
see
any
difference
between
writing
jokes
or
comic
verse
and
running
a
taking
dictation
or
keeping
sets
of
books
it
is
all
a
means
to
an
end
your
theory
is
for
me
to
begin
with
keeping
books
in
order
to
become
a
successful
lawyer
or
man
of
business
mine
is
to
begin
with
and
develop
into
an
able
is
a
difference
she
insisted
is
it
your
good
work
what
you
yourself
call
good
you
sell
you
have
tried
you
know
that
the
editors
buy
me
time
dear
he
pleaded
is
only
makeshift
and
i
take
it
seriously
give
me
two
years
i
shall
succeed
in
that
time
and
the
editors
will
be
glad
to
buy
my
good
work
i
know
what
i
am
saying
i
have
faith
in
myself
i
know
what
i
have
in
me
i
know
what
literature
is
now
i
know
the
average
rot
that
is
poured
out
by
a
lot
of
little
men
and
i
know
that
at
the
end
of
two
years
i
shall
be
on
the
highroad
to
success
as
for
business
i
shall
never
succeed
at
it
i
am
not
in
sympathy
with
it
it
strikes
me
as
dull
and
stupid
and
mercenary
and
tricky
anyway
i
am
not
adapted
for
it
never
get
beyond
a
clerkship
and
how
could
you
and
i
be
happy
on
the
paltry
earnings
of
a
clerk
i
want
the
best
of
everything
in
the
world
for
you
and
the
only
time
when
i
want
it
will
be
when
there
is
something
better
and
going
to
get
it
going
to
get
all
of
it
the
income
of
a
successful
author
makes
butler
look
cheap
a
will
earn
anywhere
between
fifty
and
a
hundred
thousand
more
and
sometimes
less
but
as
a
rule
pretty
close
to
those
she
remained
silent
her
disappointment
was
apparent
he
asked
had
hoped
and
planned
otherwise
i
had
thought
and
i
still
think
that
the
best
thing
for
you
would
be
to
study
already
know
go
into
office
you
have
a
good
mind
and
i
am
confident
you
would
succeed
as
a
chapter
xxiii
that
ruth
had
little
faith
in
his
power
as
a
writer
did
not
alter
her
nor
diminish
her
in
eyes
in
the
breathing
spell
of
the
vacation
he
had
taken
he
had
spent
many
hours
in
and
thereby
learned
much
of
himself
he
had
discovered
that
he
loved
beauty
more
than
fame
and
that
what
desire
he
had
for
fame
was
largely
for
sake
it
was
for
this
reason
that
his
desire
for
fame
was
strong
he
wanted
to
be
great
in
the
eyes
make
good
as
he
expressed
it
in
order
that
the
woman
he
loved
should
be
proud
of
him
and
deem
him
worthy
as
for
himself
he
loved
beauty
passionately
and
the
joy
of
serving
her
was
to
him
sufficient
wage
and
more
than
beauty
he
loved
ruth
he
considered
love
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
it
was
love
that
had
worked
the
revolution
in
him
changing
him
from
an
uncouth
sailor
to
a
student
and
an
artist
therefore
to
him
the
finest
and
greatest
of
the
three
greater
than
learning
and
artistry
was
love
already
he
had
discovered
that
his
brain
went
beyond
just
as
it
went
beyond
the
brains
of
her
brothers
or
the
brain
of
her
father
in
spite
of
every
advantage
of
university
training
and
in
the
face
of
her
bachelorship
of
arts
his
power
of
intellect
overshadowed
hers
and
his
year
or
so
of
and
equipment
gave
him
a
mastery
of
the
affairs
of
the
world
and
art
and
life
that
she
could
never
hope
to
possess
all
this
he
realized
but
it
did
not
affect
his
love
for
her
nor
her
love
for
him
love
was
too
fine
and
noble
and
he
was
too
loyal
a
lover
for
him
to
besmirch
love
with
criticism
what
did
love
have
to
do
with
divergent
views
on
art
right
conduct
the
french
revolution
or
equal
suffrage
they
were
mental
processes
but
love
was
beyond
reason
it
was
superrational
he
could
not
belittle
love
he
worshipped
it
love
lay
on
the
beyond
the
of
reason
it
was
a
sublimated
condition
of
existence
the
topmost
peak
of
living
and
it
came
rarely
thanks
to
the
school
of
scientific
philosophers
he
favored
he
knew
the
biological
significance
of
love
but
by
a
refined
process
of
the
same
scientific
reasoning
he
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
human
organism
achieved
its
highest
purpose
in
love
that
love
must
not
be
questioned
but
must
be
accepted
as
the
highest
guerdon
of
life
thus
he
considered
the
lover
blessed
over
all
creatures
and
it
was
a
delight
to
him
to
think
of
own
mad
lover
rising
above
the
things
of
earth
above
wealth
and
judgment
public
opinion
and
applause
rising
above
life
itself
and
on
a
much
of
this
martin
had
already
reasoned
out
and
some
of
it
he
reasoned
out
later
in
the
meantime
he
worked
taking
no
recreation
except
when
he
went
to
see
ruth
and
living
like
a
spartan
he
paid
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
month
rent
for
the
small
room
he
got
from
his
portuguese
landlady
maria
silva
a
virago
and
a
widow
hard
working
and
harsher
tempered
rearing
her
large
brood
of
children
somehow
and
drowning
her
sorrow
and
fatigue
at
irregular
intervals
in
a
gallon
of
the
thin
sour
wine
that
she
bought
from
the
corner
grocery
and
saloon
for
fifteen
cents
from
detesting
her
and
her
foul
tongue
at
first
martin
grew
to
admire
her
as
he
observed
the
brave
fight
she
made
there
were
but
four
rooms
in
the
little
when
was
subtracted
one
of
these
the
parlor
gay
with
an
ingrain
carpet
and
dolorous
with
a
funeral
card
and
a
of
one
of
her
numerous
departed
babes
was
kept
strictly
for
company
the
blinds
were
always
down
and
her
barefooted
tribe
was
never
permitted
to
enter
the
sacred
precinct
save
on
state
occasions
she
cooked
and
all
ate
in
the
kitchen
where
she
likewise
washed
starched
and
ironed
clothes
on
all
days
of
the
week
except
sunday
for
her
income
came
largely
from
taking
in
washing
from
her
more
prosperous
neighbors
remained
the
bedroom
small
as
the
one
occupied
by
martin
into
which
she
and
her
seven
little
ones
crowded
and
slept
it
was
an
everlasting
miracle
to
martin
how
it
was
accomplished
and
from
her
side
of
the
thin
partition
he
heard
nightly
every
detail
of
the
going
to
bed
the
squalls
and
squabbles
the
soft
chattering
and
the
sleepy
twittering
noises
as
of
birds
another
source
of
income
to
maria
were
her
cows
two
of
them
which
she
milked
night
and
morning
and
which
gained
a
surreptitious
livelihood
from
vacant
lots
and
the
grass
that
grew
on
either
side
the
public
side
walks
attended
always
by
one
or
more
of
her
ragged
boys
whose
watchful
guardianship
consisted
chiefly
in
keeping
their
eyes
out
for
the
poundmen
in
his
own
small
room
martin
lived
slept
studied
wrote
and
kept
house
before
the
one
window
looking
out
on
the
tiny
front
porch
was
the
kitchen
table
that
served
as
desk
library
and
stand
the
bed
against
the
rear
wall
occupied
of
the
total
space
of
the
room
the
table
was
flanked
on
one
side
by
a
gaudy
bureau
manufactured
for
profit
and
not
for
service
the
thin
veneer
of
which
was
shed
day
by
day
this
bureau
stood
in
the
corner
and
in
the
opposite
corner
on
the
other
flank
was
the
on
a
box
inside
of
which
were
dishes
and
cooking
utensils
a
shelf
on
the
wall
for
provisions
and
a
bucket
of
water
on
the
floor
martin
had
to
carry
his
water
from
the
kitchen
sink
there
being
no
tap
in
his
room
on
days
when
there
was
much
steam
to
his
cooking
the
harvest
of
veneer
from
the
bureau
was
unusually
generous
over
the
bed
hoisted
by
a
tackle
to
the
ceiling
was
his
bicycle
at
first
he
had
tried
to
keep
it
in
the
basement
but
the
tribe
of
silva
loosening
the
bearings
and
puncturing
the
tires
had
driven
him
out
next
he
attempted
the
tiny
front
porch
until
a
howling
southeaster
drenched
the
wheel
a
then
he
had
retreated
with
it
to
his
room
and
slung
it
aloft
a
small
closet
contained
his
clothes
and
the
books
he
had
accumulated
and
for
which
there
was
no
room
on
the
table
or
under
the
table
hand
in
hand
with
reading
he
had
developed
the
habit
of
making
notes
and
so
copiously
did
he
make
them
that
there
would
have
been
no
existence
for
him
in
the
confined
quarters
had
he
not
rigged
several
across
the
room
on
which
the
notes
were
hung
even
so
he
was
crowded
until
navigating
the
room
was
a
difficult
task
he
could
not
open
the
door
without
first
closing
the
closet
door
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
anywhere
to
traverse
the
room
in
a
straight
line
to
go
from
the
door
to
the
head
of
the
bed
was
a
zigzag
course
that
he
was
never
quite
able
to
accomplish
in
the
dark
without
collisions
having
settled
the
difficulty
of
the
conflicting
doors
he
had
to
steer
sharply
to
the
right
to
avoid
the
kitchen
next
he
sheered
to
the
left
to
escape
the
foot
of
the
bed
but
this
sheer
if
too
generous
brought
him
against
the
corner
of
the
table
with
a
sudden
twitch
and
lurch
he
terminated
the
sheer
and
bore
off
to
the
right
along
a
sort
of
canal
one
bank
of
which
was
the
bed
the
other
the
table
when
the
one
chair
in
the
room
was
at
its
usual
place
before
the
table
the
canal
was
unnavigable
when
the
chair
was
not
in
use
it
reposed
on
top
of
the
bed
though
sometimes
he
sat
on
the
chair
when
cooking
reading
a
book
while
the
water
boiled
and
even
becoming
skilful
enough
to
manage
a
paragraph
or
two
while
steak
was
frying
also
so
small
was
the
little
corner
that
constituted
the
kitchen
he
was
able
sitting
down
to
reach
anything
he
needed
in
fact
it
was
expedient
to
cook
sitting
down
standing
up
he
was
too
often
in
his
own
way
in
conjunction
with
a
perfect
stomach
that
could
digest
anything
he
possessed
knowledge
of
the
various
foods
that
were
at
the
same
time
nutritious
and
cheap
was
a
common
article
in
his
diet
as
well
as
potatoes
and
beans
the
latter
large
and
brown
and
cooked
in
mexican
style
rice
cooked
as
american
housewives
never
cook
it
and
can
never
learn
to
cook
it
appeared
on
table
at
least
once
a
day
dried
fruits
were
less
expensive
than
fresh
and
he
had
usually
a
pot
of
them
cooked
and
ready
at
hand
for
they
took
the
place
of
butter
on
his
bread
occasionally
he
graced
his
table
with
a
piece
of
or
with
a
coffee
without
cream
or
milk
he
had
twice
a
day
in
the
evening
substituting
tea
but
both
coffee
and
tea
were
excellently
cooked
there
was
need
for
him
to
be
economical
his
vacation
had
consumed
nearly
all
he
had
earned
in
the
laundry
and
he
was
so
far
from
his
market
that
weeks
must
elapse
before
he
could
hope
for
the
first
returns
from
his
except
at
such
times
as
he
saw
ruth
or
dropped
in
to
see
his
sister
gertude
he
lived
a
recluse
in
each
day
accomplishing
at
least
three
labor
of
ordinary
men
he
slept
a
scant
five
hours
and
only
one
with
a
constitution
of
iron
could
have
held
himself
down
as
martin
did
day
after
day
to
nineteen
consecutive
hours
of
toil
he
never
lost
a
moment
on
the
were
lists
of
definitions
and
pronunciations
when
shaving
or
dressing
or
combing
his
hair
he
conned
these
lists
over
similar
lists
were
on
the
wall
over
the
and
they
were
similarly
conned
while
he
was
engaged
in
cooking
or
in
washing
the
dishes
new
lists
continually
displaced
the
old
ones
every
strange
or
partly
familiar
word
encountered
in
his
reading
was
immediately
jotted
down
and
later
when
a
sufficient
number
had
been
accumulated
were
typed
and
pinned
to
the
wall
or
he
even
carried
them
in
his
pockets
and
reviewed
them
at
odd
moments
on
the
street
or
while
waiting
in
butcher
shop
or
grocery
to
be
served
he
went
farther
in
the
matter
reading
the
works
of
men
who
had
arrived
he
noted
every
result
achieved
by
them
and
worked
out
the
tricks
by
which
they
had
been
tricks
of
narrative
of
exposition
of
style
the
points
of
view
the
contrasts
the
epigrams
and
of
all
these
he
made
lists
for
study
he
did
not
ape
he
sought
principles
he
drew
up
lists
of
effective
and
fetching
mannerisms
till
out
of
many
such
culled
from
many
writers
he
was
able
to
induce
the
general
principle
of
mannerism
and
thus
equipped
to
cast
about
for
new
and
original
ones
of
his
own
and
to
weigh
and
measure
and
appraise
them
properly
in
similar
manner
he
collected
lists
of
strong
phrases
the
phrases
of
living
language
phrases
that
bit
like
acid
and
scorched
like
flame
or
that
glowed
and
were
mellow
and
luscious
in
the
midst
of
the
arid
desert
of
common
speech
he
sought
always
for
the
principle
that
lay
behind
and
beneath
he
wanted
to
know
how
the
thing
was
done
after
that
he
could
do
it
for
himself
he
was
not
content
with
the
fair
face
of
beauty
he
dissected
beauty
in
his
crowded
little
bedroom
laboratory
where
cooking
smells
alternated
with
the
outer
bedlam
of
the
silva
tribe
and
having
dissected
and
learned
the
anatomy
of
beauty
he
was
nearer
being
able
to
create
beauty
itself
he
was
so
made
that
he
could
work
only
with
understanding
he
could
not
work
blindly
in
the
dark
ignorant
of
what
he
was
producing
and
trusting
to
chance
and
the
star
of
his
genius
that
the
effect
produced
should
be
right
and
fine
he
had
no
patience
with
chance
effects
he
wanted
to
know
why
and
how
his
was
deliberate
creative
genius
and
before
he
began
a
story
or
poem
the
thing
itself
was
already
alive
in
his
brain
with
the
end
in
sight
and
the
means
of
realizing
that
end
in
his
conscious
possession
otherwise
the
effort
was
doomed
to
failure
on
the
other
hand
he
appreciated
the
chance
effects
in
words
and
phrases
that
came
lightly
and
easily
into
his
brain
and
that
later
stood
all
tests
of
beauty
and
power
and
developed
tremendous
and
incommunicable
connotations
before
such
he
bowed
down
and
marvelled
knowing
that
they
were
beyond
the
deliberate
creation
of
any
man
and
no
matter
how
much
he
dissected
beauty
in
search
of
the
principles
that
underlie
beauty
and
make
beauty
possible
he
was
aware
always
of
the
innermost
mystery
of
beauty
to
which
he
did
not
penetrate
and
to
which
no
man
had
ever
penetrated
he
knew
full
well
from
his
spencer
that
man
can
never
attain
ultimate
knowledge
of
anything
and
that
the
mystery
of
beauty
was
no
less
than
that
of
the
fibres
of
beauty
and
life
were
intertwisted
and
that
he
himself
was
but
a
bit
of
the
same
nonunderstandable
fabric
twisted
of
sunshine
and
and
wonder
in
fact
it
was
when
filled
with
these
thoughts
that
he
wrote
his
essay
entitled
in
which
he
had
his
fling
not
at
the
principles
of
criticism
but
at
the
principal
critics
it
was
brilliant
deep
philosophical
and
deliciously
touched
with
laughter
also
it
was
promptly
rejected
by
the
magazines
as
often
as
it
was
submitted
but
having
cleared
his
mind
of
it
he
went
serenely
on
his
way
it
was
a
habit
he
developed
of
incubating
and
maturing
his
thought
upon
a
subject
and
of
then
rushing
into
the
with
it
that
it
did
not
see
print
was
a
matter
of
small
moment
with
him
the
writing
of
it
was
the
culminating
act
of
a
long
mental
process
the
drawing
together
of
scattered
threads
of
thought
and
the
final
generalizing
upon
all
the
data
with
which
his
mind
was
burdened
to
write
such
an
article
was
the
conscious
effort
by
which
he
freed
his
mind
and
made
it
ready
for
fresh
material
and
problems
it
was
in
a
way
akin
to
that
common
habit
of
men
and
women
troubled
by
real
or
fancied
grievances
who
periodically
and
volubly
break
their
silence
and
their
till
the
last
word
is
said
chapter
xxiv
the
weeks
passed
martin
ran
out
of
money
and
checks
were
far
away
as
ever
all
his
important
manuscripts
had
come
back
and
been
started
out
again
and
his
fared
no
better
his
little
kitchen
was
no
longer
graced
with
a
variety
of
foods
caught
in
the
pinch
with
a
part
sack
of
rice
and
a
few
pounds
of
dried
apricots
rice
and
apricots
was
his
menu
three
times
a
day
for
five
days
then
he
startled
to
realize
on
his
credit
the
portuguese
grocer
to
whom
he
had
hitherto
paid
cash
called
a
halt
when
bill
reached
the
magnificent
total
of
three
dollars
and
cents
you
see
said
the
grocer
no
catcha
da
work
i
losa
da
and
martin
could
reply
nothing
there
was
no
way
of
explaining
it
was
not
true
business
principle
to
allow
credit
to
a
young
fellow
of
the
who
was
too
lazy
to
work
catcha
da
job
i
let
you
have
mora
da
grub
the
grocer
assured
martin
job
no
grub
thata
da
and
then
to
show
that
it
was
purely
business
foresight
and
not
prejudice
da
drink
on
da
friends
justa
da
so
martin
drank
in
his
easy
way
to
show
that
he
was
good
friends
with
the
house
and
then
went
supperless
to
bed
the
fruit
store
where
martin
had
bought
his
vegetables
was
run
by
an
american
whose
business
principles
were
so
weak
that
he
let
martin
run
a
bill
of
five
dollars
before
stopping
his
credit
the
baker
stopped
at
two
dollars
and
the
butcher
at
four
dollars
martin
added
his
debts
and
found
that
he
was
possessed
of
a
total
credit
in
all
the
world
of
fourteen
dollars
and
cents
he
was
up
with
his
rent
but
he
estimated
that
he
could
get
two
credit
on
that
which
would
be
eight
dollars
when
that
occurred
he
would
have
exhausted
all
possible
credit
the
last
purchase
from
the
fruit
store
had
been
a
sack
of
potatoes
and
for
a
week
he
had
potatoes
and
nothing
but
potatoes
three
times
a
day
an
occasional
dinner
at
helped
to
keep
strength
in
his
body
though
he
found
it
tantalizing
enough
to
refuse
further
helping
when
his
appetite
was
raging
at
sight
of
so
much
food
spread
before
it
now
and
again
though
afflicted
with
secret
shame
he
dropped
in
at
his
at
and
ate
as
much
as
he
than
he
dared
at
the
morse
table
day
by
day
he
worked
on
and
day
by
day
the
postman
delivered
to
him
rejected
manuscripts
he
had
no
money
for
stamps
so
the
manuscripts
accumulated
in
a
heap
under
the
table
came
a
day
when
for
forty
hours
he
had
not
tasted
food
he
could
not
hope
for
a
meal
at
for
she
was
away
to
san
rafael
on
a
two
visit
and
for
very
sake
he
could
not
go
to
his
to
cap
misfortune
the
postman
in
his
afternoon
round
brought
him
five
returned
manuscripts
then
it
was
that
martin
wore
his
overcoat
down
into
oakland
and
came
back
without
it
but
with
five
dollars
tinkling
in
his
pocket
he
paid
a
dollar
each
on
account
to
the
four
tradesmen
and
in
his
kitchen
fried
steak
and
onions
made
coffee
and
stewed
a
large
pot
of
prunes
and
having
dined
he
sat
down
at
his
and
completed
before
midnight
an
essay
which
he
entitled
dignity
of
having
typed
it
out
he
flung
it
under
the
table
for
there
had
been
nothing
left
from
the
five
dollars
with
which
to
buy
stamps
later
on
he
pawned
his
watch
and
still
later
his
wheel
reducing
the
amount
available
for
food
by
putting
stamps
on
all
his
manuscripts
and
sending
them
out
he
was
disappointed
with
his
nobody
cared
to
buy
he
compared
it
with
what
he
found
in
the
newspapers
weeklies
and
cheap
magazines
and
decided
that
his
was
better
far
better
than
the
average
yet
it
would
not
sell
then
he
discovered
that
most
of
the
newspapers
printed
a
great
deal
of
what
was
called
stuff
and
he
got
the
address
of
the
association
that
furnished
it
his
own
work
that
he
sent
in
was
returned
along
with
a
stereotyped
slip
informing
him
that
the
staff
supplied
all
the
copy
that
was
needed
in
one
of
the
great
juvenile
periodicals
he
noted
whole
columns
of
incident
and
anecdote
here
was
a
chance
his
paragraphs
were
returned
and
though
he
tried
repeatedly
he
never
succeeded
in
placing
one
later
on
when
it
no
longer
mattered
he
learned
that
the
associate
editors
and
augmented
their
salaries
by
supplying
those
paragraphs
themselves
the
comic
weeklies
returned
his
jokes
and
humorous
verse
and
the
light
society
verse
he
wrote
for
the
large
magazines
found
no
then
there
was
the
newspaper
storiette
he
knew
that
he
could
write
better
ones
than
were
published
managing
to
obtain
the
addresses
of
two
newspaper
syndicates
he
deluged
them
with
storiettes
when
he
had
written
twenty
and
failed
to
place
one
of
them
he
ceased
and
yet
from
day
to
day
he
read
storiettes
in
the
dailies
and
weeklies
scores
and
scores
of
storiettes
not
one
of
which
would
compare
with
his
in
his
despondency
he
concluded
that
he
had
no
judgment
whatever
that
he
was
hypnotized
by
what
he
wrote
and
that
he
was
a
pretender
the
inhuman
editorial
machine
ran
smoothly
as
ever
he
folded
the
stamps
in
with
his
manuscript
dropped
it
into
the
and
from
three
weeks
to
a
month
afterward
the
postman
came
up
the
steps
and
handed
him
the
manuscript
surely
there
were
no
live
warm
editors
at
the
other
end
it
was
all
wheels
and
cogs
and
clever
mechanism
operated
by
automatons
he
reached
stages
of
despair
wherein
he
doubted
if
editors
existed
at
all
he
had
never
received
a
sign
of
the
existence
of
one
and
from
absence
of
judgment
in
rejecting
all
he
wrote
it
seemed
plausible
that
editors
were
myths
manufactured
and
maintained
by
office
boys
typesetters
and
pressmen
the
hours
he
spent
with
ruth
were
the
only
happy
ones
he
had
and
they
were
not
all
happy
he
was
afflicted
always
with
a
gnawing
restlessness
more
tantalizing
than
in
the
old
days
before
he
possessed
her
love
for
now
that
he
did
possess
her
love
the
possession
of
her
was
far
away
as
ever
he
had
asked
for
two
years
time
was
flying
and
he
was
achieving
nothing
again
he
was
always
conscious
of
the
fact
that
she
did
not
approve
what
he
was
doing
she
did
not
say
so
directly
yet
indirectly
she
let
him
understand
it
as
clearly
and
definitely
as
she
could
have
spoken
it
it
was
not
resentment
with
her
but
disapproval
though
less
women
might
have
resented
where
she
was
no
more
than
disappointed
her
disappointment
lay
in
that
this
man
she
had
taken
to
mould
refused
to
be
moulded
to
a
certain
extent
she
had
found
his
clay
plastic
then
it
had
developed
stubbornness
declining
to
be
shaped
in
the
image
of
her
father
or
of
butler
what
was
great
and
strong
in
him
she
missed
or
worse
yet
misunderstood
this
man
whose
clay
was
so
plastic
that
he
could
live
in
any
number
of
pigeonholes
of
human
existence
she
thought
wilful
and
most
obstinate
because
she
could
not
shape
him
to
live
in
her
pigeonhole
which
was
the
only
one
she
knew
she
could
not
follow
the
flights
of
his
mind
and
when
his
brain
got
beyond
her
she
deemed
him
erratic
nobody
brain
ever
got
beyond
her
she
could
always
follow
her
father
and
mother
her
brothers
and
olney
wherefore
when
she
could
not
follow
martin
she
believed
the
fault
lay
with
him
it
was
the
old
tragedy
of
insularity
trying
to
serve
as
mentor
to
the
universal
worship
at
the
shrine
of
the
established
he
told
her
once
in
a
discussion
they
had
over
praps
and
vanderwater
grant
that
as
authorities
to
quote
they
are
most
two
foremost
literary
critics
in
the
united
states
every
school
teacher
in
the
land
looks
up
to
vanderwater
as
the
dean
of
american
criticism
yet
i
read
his
stuff
and
it
seems
to
me
the
perfection
of
the
felicitous
expression
of
the
inane
why
he
is
no
more
than
a
ponderous
bromide
thanks
to
gelett
burgess
and
praps
is
no
better
his
mosses
for
instance
is
beautifully
written
not
a
comma
is
out
of
place
and
the
lofty
so
lofty
he
is
the
critic
in
the
united
states
though
heaven
forbid
not
a
critic
at
all
they
do
criticism
better
in
england
the
point
is
they
sound
the
popular
note
and
they
sound
it
so
beautifully
and
morally
and
contentedly
their
reviews
remind
me
of
a
british
sunday
they
are
the
popular
mouthpieces
they
back
up
your
professors
of
english
and
your
professors
of
english
back
them
up
and
there
an
original
idea
in
any
of
their
skulls
they
know
only
the
established
fact
they
are
the
established
they
are
weak
minded
and
the
established
impresses
itself
upon
them
as
easily
as
the
name
of
the
brewery
is
impressed
on
a
beer
bottle
and
their
function
is
to
catch
all
the
young
fellows
attending
the
university
to
drive
out
of
their
minds
any
glimmering
originality
that
may
chance
to
be
there
and
to
put
upon
them
the
stamp
of
the
think
i
am
nearer
the
truth
she
replied
i
stand
by
the
established
than
you
are
raging
around
like
an
iconoclastic
south
sea
was
the
missionary
who
did
the
image
breaking
he
laughed
unfortunately
all
the
missionaries
are
off
among
the
heathen
so
there
are
none
left
at
home
to
break
those
old
images
vanderwater
and
the
college
professors
as
well
she
added
he
shook
his
head
emphatically
the
science
professors
should
live
really
great
but
it
would
be
a
good
deed
to
break
the
heads
of
of
the
english
parrots
which
was
rather
severe
on
the
professors
but
which
to
ruth
was
blasphemy
she
could
not
help
but
measure
the
professors
neat
scholarly
in
fitting
clothes
speaking
in
voices
breathing
of
culture
and
refinement
with
this
almost
indescribable
young
fellow
whom
somehow
she
loved
whose
clothes
never
would
fit
him
whose
heavy
muscles
told
of
damning
toil
who
grew
excited
when
he
talked
substituting
abuse
for
calm
statement
and
passionate
utterance
for
cool
they
at
least
earned
good
salaries
and
she
compelled
herself
to
face
gentlemen
while
he
could
not
earn
a
penny
and
he
was
not
as
they
she
did
not
weigh
words
nor
judge
his
argument
by
them
her
conclusion
that
his
argument
was
wrong
was
it
is
a
comparison
of
externals
they
the
professors
were
right
in
their
literary
judgments
because
they
were
successes
literary
judgments
were
wrong
because
he
could
not
sell
his
wares
to
use
his
own
phrase
they
made
good
and
he
did
not
make
good
and
besides
it
did
not
seem
reasonable
that
he
should
be
who
had
stood
so
short
a
time
before
in
that
same
living
room
blushing
and
awkward
acknowledging
his
introduction
looking
fearfully
about
him
at
the
his
swinging
shoulders
threatened
to
break
asking
how
long
since
swinburne
died
and
boastfully
announcing
that
he
had
read
and
the
of
unwittingly
ruth
herself
proved
his
point
that
she
worshipped
the
established
martin
followed
the
processes
of
her
thoughts
but
forbore
to
go
farther
he
did
not
love
her
for
what
she
thought
of
praps
and
vanderwater
and
english
professors
and
he
was
coming
to
realize
with
increasing
conviction
that
he
possessed
and
stretches
of
knowledge
which
she
could
never
comprehend
nor
know
existed
in
music
she
thought
him
unreasonable
and
in
the
matter
of
opera
not
only
unreasonable
but
wilfully
perverse
did
you
like
it
she
asked
him
one
night
on
the
way
home
from
the
opera
it
was
a
night
when
he
had
taken
her
at
the
expense
of
a
rigid
economizing
on
food
after
vainly
waiting
for
him
to
speak
about
it
herself
still
tremulous
and
stirred
by
what
she
had
just
seen
and
heard
she
had
asked
the
question
liked
the
overture
was
his
answer
was
but
the
opera
itself
was
splendid
too
that
is
the
orchestra
was
though
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
those
had
kept
quiet
or
gone
off
the
ruth
was
aghast
mean
tetralani
or
barillo
she
queried
of
whole
kit
and
they
are
great
artists
she
protested
spoiled
the
music
just
the
same
with
their
antics
and
you
like
voice
ruth
asked
is
next
to
caruso
they
course
i
liked
him
and
i
liked
tetralani
even
better
her
voice
is
at
least
i
think
ruth
stammered
know
what
you
mean
then
you
admire
their
voices
yet
say
they
spoiled
the
that
give
anything
to
hear
them
in
concert
and
give
even
a
bit
more
not
to
hear
them
when
the
orchestra
is
playing
afraid
i
am
a
hopeless
realist
great
singers
are
not
great
actors
to
hear
barillo
sing
a
love
passage
with
the
voice
of
an
angel
and
to
hear
tetralani
reply
like
another
angel
and
to
hear
it
all
accompanied
by
a
perfect
orgy
of
glowing
and
colorful
ravishing
most
ravishing
i
do
not
admit
it
i
assert
it
but
the
whole
effect
is
spoiled
when
i
look
at
tetralani
five
feet
ten
in
her
stocking
feet
and
weighing
a
hundred
and
ninety
pounds
and
at
barillo
a
scant
five
feet
four
with
the
chest
of
a
squat
undersized
blacksmith
and
at
the
pair
of
them
attitudinizing
clasping
their
breasts
flinging
their
arms
in
the
air
like
demented
creatures
in
an
asylum
and
when
i
am
expected
to
accept
all
this
as
the
faithful
illusion
of
a
between
a
slender
and
beautiful
princess
and
a
handsome
romantic
young
i
accept
it
all
rot
absurd
unreal
the
matter
with
it
not
real
tell
me
that
anybody
in
this
world
ever
made
love
that
way
why
if
made
love
to
you
in
such
fashion
have
boxed
my
you
misunderstand
ruth
protested
form
of
art
has
its
she
was
busy
recalling
a
lecture
she
had
heard
at
the
university
on
the
conventions
of
the
arts
painting
there
are
only
two
dimensions
to
the
canvas
yet
you
accept
the
illusion
of
three
dimensions
which
the
art
of
a
painter
enables
him
to
throw
into
the
canvas
in
writing
again
the
author
must
be
omnipotent
you
accept
as
perfectly
legitimate
the
account
of
the
secret
thoughts
of
the
heroine
and
yet
all
the
time
you
know
that
the
heroine
was
alone
when
thinking
these
thoughts
and
that
neither
the
author
nor
any
one
else
was
capable
of
hearing
them
and
so
with
the
stage
with
sculpture
with
opera
with
every
art
form
certain
irreconcilable
things
must
be
i
understood
that
martin
answered
the
arts
have
their
ruth
was
surprised
at
his
use
of
the
word
it
was
as
if
he
had
studied
at
the
university
himself
instead
of
being
from
browsing
at
haphazard
through
the
books
in
the
library
even
the
conventions
must
be
real
trees
painted
on
flat
cardboard
and
stuck
up
on
each
side
of
the
stage
we
accept
as
a
forest
it
is
a
real
enough
convention
but
on
the
other
hand
we
would
not
accept
a
sea
scene
as
a
forest
we
do
it
it
violates
our
senses
nor
would
you
or
rather
should
you
accept
the
ravings
and
writhings
and
agonized
contortions
of
those
two
lunatics
as
a
convincing
portrayal
of
you
hold
yourself
superior
to
all
the
judges
of
music
she
protested
no
not
for
a
moment
i
merely
maintain
my
right
as
an
individual
i
have
just
been
telling
you
what
i
think
in
order
to
explain
why
the
elephantine
gambols
of
madame
tetralani
spoil
the
orchestra
for
me
the
judges
of
music
may
all
be
right
but
i
am
i
and
i
subordinate
my
taste
to
the
unanimous
judgment
of
mankind
if
i
like
a
thing
i
like
it
all
and
there
is
no
reason
under
the
sun
why
i
should
ape
a
liking
for
it
just
because
the
majority
of
my
like
it
or
make
believe
they
like
it
i
follow
the
fashions
in
the
things
i
like
or
music
you
know
is
a
matter
of
training
ruth
argued
opera
is
even
more
a
matter
of
training
may
it
not
i
am
not
trained
in
opera
he
dashed
in
she
nodded
very
thing
he
agreed
i
consider
i
am
fortunate
in
not
having
been
caught
when
i
was
young
if
i
had
i
could
have
wept
sentimental
tears
and
the
clownish
antics
of
that
precious
pair
would
have
but
enhanced
the
beauty
of
their
voices
and
the
beauty
of
the
accompanying
orchestra
you
are
right
mostly
a
matter
of
training
and
i
am
too
old
now
i
must
have
the
real
or
nothing
an
illusion
that
convince
is
a
palpable
lie
and
what
grand
opera
is
to
me
when
little
barillo
throws
a
fit
clutches
mighty
tetralani
in
his
arms
also
in
a
fit
and
tells
her
how
passionately
he
adores
again
ruth
measured
his
thoughts
by
comparison
of
externals
and
in
accordance
with
her
belief
in
the
established
who
was
he
that
he
should
be
right
and
all
the
cultured
world
wrong
his
words
and
thoughts
made
no
impression
upon
her
she
was
too
firmly
intrenched
in
the
established
to
have
any
sympathy
with
revolutionary
ideas
she
had
always
been
used
to
music
and
she
had
enjoyed
opera
ever
since
she
was
a
child
and
all
her
world
had
enjoyed
it
too
then
by
what
right
did
martin
eden
emerge
as
he
had
so
recently
emerged
from
his
and
songs
and
pass
judgment
on
the
music
she
was
vexed
with
him
and
as
she
walked
beside
him
she
had
a
vague
feeling
of
outrage
at
the
best
in
her
most
charitable
frame
of
mind
she
considered
the
statement
of
his
views
to
be
a
caprice
an
erratic
and
prank
but
when
he
took
her
in
his
arms
at
the
door
and
kissed
her
good
night
in
tender
she
forgot
everything
in
the
outrush
of
her
own
love
to
him
and
later
on
a
sleepless
pillow
she
puzzled
as
she
had
often
puzzled
of
late
as
to
how
it
was
that
she
loved
so
strange
a
man
and
loved
him
despite
the
disapproval
of
her
people
and
next
day
martin
eden
cast
aside
and
at
white
heat
hammered
out
an
essay
to
which
he
gave
the
title
philosophy
of
a
stamp
started
it
on
its
travels
but
it
was
destined
to
receive
many
stamps
and
to
be
started
on
many
travels
in
the
months
that
followed
chapter
xxv
maria
silva
was
poor
and
all
the
ways
of
poverty
were
clear
to
her
poverty
to
ruth
was
a
word
signifying
a
condition
of
existence
that
was
her
total
knowledge
on
the
subject
she
knew
martin
was
poor
and
his
condition
she
associated
in
her
mind
with
the
boyhood
of
abraham
lincoln
of
butler
and
of
other
men
who
had
become
successes
also
while
aware
that
poverty
was
anything
but
delectable
she
had
a
comfortable
feeling
that
poverty
was
salutary
that
it
was
a
sharp
spur
that
urged
on
to
success
all
men
who
were
not
degraded
and
hopeless
drudges
so
that
her
knowledge
that
martin
was
so
poor
that
he
had
pawned
his
watch
and
overcoat
did
not
disturb
her
she
even
considered
it
the
hopeful
side
of
the
situation
believing
that
sooner
or
later
it
would
arouse
him
and
compel
him
to
abandon
his
writing
ruth
never
read
hunger
in
face
which
had
grown
lean
and
had
enlarged
the
slight
hollows
in
the
cheeks
in
fact
she
marked
the
change
in
his
face
with
satisfaction
it
seemed
to
refine
him
to
remove
from
him
much
of
the
dross
of
flesh
and
the
too
vigor
that
lured
her
while
she
detested
it
sometimes
when
with
her
she
noted
an
unusual
brightness
in
his
eyes
and
she
admired
it
for
it
made
him
appear
more
the
poet
and
the
things
he
would
have
liked
to
be
and
which
she
would
have
liked
him
to
be
but
maria
silva
read
a
different
tale
in
the
hollow
cheeks
and
the
burning
eyes
and
she
noted
the
changes
in
them
from
day
to
day
by
them
following
the
ebb
and
flow
of
his
fortunes
she
saw
him
leave
the
house
with
his
overcoat
and
return
without
it
though
the
day
was
chill
and
raw
and
promptly
she
saw
his
cheeks
fill
out
slightly
and
the
fire
of
hunger
leave
his
eyes
in
the
same
way
she
had
seen
his
wheel
and
watch
go
and
after
each
event
she
had
seen
his
vigor
bloom
again
likewise
she
watched
his
toils
and
knew
the
measure
of
the
midnight
oil
he
burned
work
she
knew
that
he
outdid
her
though
his
work
was
of
a
different
order
and
she
was
surprised
to
behold
that
the
less
food
he
had
the
harder
he
worked
on
occasion
in
a
casual
sort
of
way
when
she
thought
hunger
pinched
hardest
she
would
send
him
in
a
loaf
of
new
baking
awkwardly
covering
the
act
with
banter
to
the
effect
that
it
was
better
than
he
could
bake
and
again
she
would
send
one
of
her
toddlers
in
to
him
with
a
great
pitcher
of
hot
soup
debating
inwardly
the
while
whether
she
was
justified
in
taking
it
from
the
mouths
of
her
own
flesh
and
blood
nor
was
martin
ungrateful
knowing
as
he
did
the
lives
of
the
poor
and
that
if
ever
in
the
world
there
was
charity
this
was
it
on
a
day
when
she
had
filled
her
brood
with
what
was
left
in
the
house
maria
invested
her
last
fifteen
cents
in
a
gallon
of
cheap
wine
martin
coming
into
her
kitchen
to
fetch
water
was
invited
to
sit
down
and
drink
he
drank
her
health
and
in
return
she
drank
his
then
she
drank
to
prosperity
in
his
undertakings
and
he
drank
to
the
hope
that
james
grant
would
show
up
and
pay
her
for
his
washing
james
grant
was
a
journeymen
carpenter
who
did
not
always
pay
his
bills
and
who
owed
maria
three
dollars
both
maria
and
martin
drank
the
sour
new
wine
on
empty
stomachs
and
it
went
swiftly
to
their
heads
utterly
differentiated
creatures
that
they
were
they
were
lonely
in
their
misery
and
though
the
misery
was
tacitly
ignored
it
was
the
bond
that
drew
them
together
maria
was
amazed
to
learn
that
he
had
been
in
the
azores
where
she
had
lived
until
she
was
eleven
she
was
doubly
amazed
that
he
had
been
in
the
hawaiian
islands
whither
she
had
migrated
from
the
azores
with
her
people
but
her
amazement
passed
all
bounds
when
he
told
her
he
had
been
on
maui
the
particular
island
whereon
she
had
attained
womanhood
and
married
kahului
where
she
had
first
met
her
husband
martin
had
been
there
twice
yes
she
remembered
the
sugar
steamers
and
he
had
been
on
well
it
was
a
small
world
and
wailuku
that
place
too
did
he
know
the
of
the
plantation
yes
and
had
had
a
couple
of
drinks
with
him
and
so
they
reminiscenced
and
drowned
their
hunger
in
the
raw
sour
wine
to
martin
the
future
did
not
seem
so
dim
success
trembled
just
before
him
he
was
on
the
verge
of
clasping
it
then
he
studied
the
face
of
the
woman
before
him
remembered
her
soups
and
loaves
of
new
baking
and
felt
spring
up
in
him
the
warmest
gratitude
and
philanthropy
he
exclaimed
suddenly
would
you
like
to
have
she
looked
at
him
bepuzzled
would
you
like
to
have
now
right
now
if

he
announced
while
she
nodded
her
head
gravely
i
mean
a
big
wish
something
big
that
you
her
eyes
sparkled
he
was
choosing
to
make
fun
with
her
maria
with
whom
few
made
fun
these
days
hard
he
cautioned
just
as
she
was
opening
her
mouth
to
speak
right
she
answered

i
maria
considered

space

she
asked
warningly

he
laughed
not
afraid

she
warned
again
right

she
drew
a
big
breath
like
a
child
as
she
voiced

the
uttermost

she
paused
and
regarded
martin
with
twinkling
eyes

he
answered
promptly
she
nodded
her
head
and
touched
her
lips
courteously
to
the
and
to
the
giver
of
the
gift
she
knew
would
never
be
given
his
heart
was
right
and
in
her
own
heart
she
appreciated
his
intention
as
much
as
if
the
gift
had
gone
with
it
maria
he
went
on
and
joe

the
whole

round
it
will
be
a
milk
complete
there
will
be
a
house
to
live
in
and
a
stable
for
the
horses
and
of
course
there
will
be
chickens
pigs
vegetables
fruit
trees
and
everything
like
that
and
there
will
be
enough
cows
to
pay
for
a
hired
man
or
two
then
you
have
anything
to
do
but
take
care
of
the
children
for
that
matter
if
you
find
a
good
man
you
can
marry
and
take
it
easy
while
he
runs
the
and
from
such
largess
dispensed
from
his
future
martin
turned
and
took
his
one
good
suit
of
clothes
to
the
pawnshop
his
plight
was
desperate
for
him
to
do
this
for
it
cut
him
off
from
ruth
he
had
no
suit
that
was
presentable
and
though
he
could
go
to
the
butcher
and
the
baker
and
even
on
occasion
to
his
it
was
beyond
all
daring
to
dream
of
entering
the
morse
home
so
disreputably
apparelled
he
toiled
on
miserable
and
hopeless
it
began
to
appear
to
him
that
the
second
battle
was
lost
and
that
he
would
have
to
go
to
work
in
doing
this
he
would
satisfy
grocer
his
sister
ruth
and
even
maria
to
whom
he
owed
a
room
rent
he
was
two
months
behind
with
his
and
the
agency
was
clamoring
for
payment
or
for
the
return
of
the
machine
in
desperation
all
but
ready
to
surrender
to
make
a
truce
with
fate
until
he
could
get
a
fresh
start
he
took
the
civil
service
examinations
for
the
railway
mail
to
his
surprise
he
passed
first
the
job
was
assured
though
when
the
call
would
come
to
enter
upon
his
duties
nobody
knew
it
was
at
this
time
at
the
lowest
ebb
that
the
editorial
machine
broke
down
a
cog
must
have
slipped
or
an
run
dry
for
the
postman
brought
him
one
morning
a
short
thin
envelope
martin
glanced
at
the
upper
corner
and
read
the
name
and
address
of
the
his
heart
gave
a
great
leap
and
he
suddenly
felt
faint
the
sinking
feeling
accompanied
by
a
strange
trembling
of
the
knees
he
staggered
into
his
room
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
the
envelope
still
unopened
and
in
that
moment
came
understanding
to
him
how
people
suddenly
fall
dead
upon
receipt
of
extraordinarily
good
news
of
course
this
was
good
news
there
was
no
manuscript
in
that
thin
envelope
therefore
it
was
an
acceptance
he
knew
the
story
in
the
hands
of
the
it
was
ring
of
bells
one
of
his
horror
stories
and
it
was
an
even
five
thousand
words
and
since
magazines
always
paid
on
acceptance
there
was
a
check
inside
two
cents
a
dollars
a
thousand
the
check
must
be
a
hundred
dollars
one
hundred
dollars
as
he
tore
the
envelope
open
every
item
of
all
his
debts
surged
in
his
to
the
grocer
butcher
flat
baker
fruit
store
total
then
there
was
room
rent
another
month
in
advance
two
a
month
in
advance
total
and
finally
to
be
added
his
pledges
plus
interest
with
the
overcoat
wheel
suit
of
clothes
interest
but
what
did
it
matter
total
he
saw
as
if
visible
in
the
air
before
him
in
illuminated
figures
the
whole
sum
and
the
subtraction
that
followed
and
that
gave
a
remainder
of
when
he
had
squared
every
debt
redeemed
every
pledge
he
would
still
have
jingling
in
his
pockets
a
princely
and
on
top
of
that
he
would
have
a
rent
paid
in
advance
on
the
and
on
the
room
by
this
time
he
had
drawn
the
single
sheet
of
letter
out
and
spread
it
open
there
was
no
check
he
peered
into
the
envelope
held
it
to
the
light
but
could
not
trust
his
eyes
and
in
trembling
haste
tore
the
envelope
apart
there
was
no
check
he
read
the
letter
skimming
it
line
by
line
dashing
through
the
praise
of
his
story
to
the
meat
of
the
letter
the
statement
why
the
check
had
not
been
sent
he
found
no
such
statement
but
he
did
find
that
which
made
him
suddenly
wilt
the
letter
slid
from
his
hand
his
eyes
went
and
he
lay
back
on
the
pillow
pulling
the
blanket
about
him
and
up
to
his
chin
five
dollars
for
ring
of
dollars
for
five
thousand
words
instead
of
two
cents
a
word
ten
words
for
a
cent
and
the
editor
had
praised
it
too
and
he
would
receive
the
check
when
the
story
was
published
then
it
was
all
poppycock
two
cents
a
word
for
minimum
rate
and
payment
upon
acceptance
it
was
a
lie
and
it
had
led
him
astray
he
would
never
have
attempted
to
write
had
he
known
that
he
would
have
gone
to
work
for
ruth
he
went
back
to
the
day
he
first
attempted
to
write
and
was
appalled
at
the
enormous
waste
of
all
for
ten
words
for
a
cent
and
the
other
high
rewards
of
writers
that
he
had
read
about
must
be
lies
too
his
ideas
of
authorship
were
wrong
for
here
was
the
proof
of
it
the
sold
for
cents
and
its
dignified
and
artistic
cover
proclaimed
it
as
among
the
magazines
it
was
a
staid
respectable
magazine
and
it
had
been
published
continuously
since
long
before
he
was
born
why
on
the
outside
cover
were
printed
every
month
the
words
of
one
of
the
great
writers
words
proclaiming
the
inspired
mission
of
the
by
a
star
of
literature
whose
first
coruscations
had
appeared
inside
those
covers
and
the
high
and
lofty
paid
five
dollars
for
five
thousand
words
the
great
writer
had
recently
died
in
a
foreign
dire
poverty
martin
remembered
which
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
considering
the
magnificent
pay
authors
receive
well
he
had
taken
the
bait
the
newspaper
lies
about
writers
and
their
pay
and
he
had
wasted
two
years
over
it
but
he
would
disgorge
the
bait
now
not
another
line
would
he
ever
write
he
would
do
what
ruth
wanted
him
to
do
what
everybody
wanted
him
to
a
job
the
thought
of
going
to
work
reminded
him
of
tramping
through
the
land
of
martin
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
envy
the
reaction
of
nineteen
hours
a
day
for
many
days
was
strong
upon
him
but
then
joe
was
not
in
love
had
none
of
the
responsibilities
of
love
and
he
could
afford
to
loaf
through
the
land
of
he
martin
had
something
to
work
for
and
go
to
work
he
would
he
would
start
out
early
next
morning
to
hunt
a
job
and
he
would
let
ruth
know
too
that
he
had
mended
his
ways
and
was
willing
to
go
into
her
office
five
dollars
for
five
thousand
words
ten
words
for
a
cent
the
market
price
for
art
the
disappointment
of
it
the
lie
of
it
the
infamy
of
it
were
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
and
under
his
closed
eyelids
in
fiery
figures
burned
the
he
owed
the
grocer
he
shivered
and
was
aware
of
an
aching
in
his
bones
the
small
of
his
back
ached
especially
his
head
ached
the
top
of
it
ached
the
back
of
it
ached
the
brains
inside
of
it
ached
and
seemed
to
be
swelling
while
the
ache
over
his
brows
was
intolerable
and
beneath
the
brows
planted
under
his
lids
was
the
merciless
he
opened
his
eyes
to
escape
it
but
the
white
light
of
the
room
seemed
to
sear
the
balls
and
forced
him
to
close
his
eyes
when
the
confronted
him
again
five
dollars
for
five
thousand
words
ten
words
for
a
particular
thought
took
up
its
residence
in
his
brain
and
he
could
no
more
escape
it
than
he
could
the
under
his
eyelids
a
change
seemed
to
come
over
the
latter
and
he
watched
curiously
till
burned
in
its
stead
ah
he
thought
that
was
the
baker
the
next
sum
that
appeared
was
it
puzzled
him
and
he
pondered
it
as
if
life
and
death
hung
on
the
solution
he
owed
somebody
two
dollars
and
a
half
that
was
certain
but
who
was
it
to
find
it
was
the
task
set
him
by
an
imperious
and
malignant
universe
and
he
wandered
through
the
endless
corridors
of
his
mind
opening
all
manner
of
lumber
rooms
and
chambers
stored
with
odds
and
ends
of
memories
and
knowledge
as
he
vainly
sought
the
answer
after
several
centuries
it
came
to
him
easily
without
effort
that
it
was
maria
with
a
great
relief
he
turned
his
soul
to
the
screen
of
torment
under
his
lids
he
had
solved
the
problem
now
he
could
rest
but
no
the
faded
away
and
in
its
place
burned
who
was
that
he
must
go
the
dreary
round
of
his
mind
again
and
find
out
how
long
he
was
gone
on
this
quest
he
did
not
know
but
after
what
seemed
an
enormous
lapse
of
time
he
was
called
back
to
himself
by
a
knock
at
the
door
and
by
asking
if
he
was
sick
he
replied
in
a
muffled
voice
he
did
not
recognize
saying
that
he
was
merely
taking
a
nap
he
was
surprised
when
he
noted
the
darkness
of
night
in
the
room
he
had
received
the
letter
at
two
in
the
afternoon
and
he
realized
that
he
was
sick
then
the
began
to
smoulder
under
his
lids
again
and
he
returned
himself
to
servitude
but
he
grew
cunning
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
wander
through
his
mind
he
had
been
a
fool
he
pulled
a
lever
and
made
his
mind
revolve
about
him
a
monstrous
wheel
of
fortune
a
of
memory
a
revolving
sphere
of
wisdom
faster
and
faster
it
revolved
until
its
vortex
sucked
him
in
and
he
was
flung
whirling
through
black
chaos
quite
naturally
he
found
himself
at
a
mangle
feeding
starched
cuffs
but
as
he
fed
he
noticed
figures
printed
in
the
cuffs
it
was
a
new
way
of
marking
linen
he
thought
until
looking
closer
he
saw
on
one
of
the
cuffs
then
it
came
to
him
that
it
was
the
bill
and
that
these
were
his
bills
flying
around
on
the
drum
of
the
mangle
a
crafty
idea
came
to
him
he
would
throw
the
bills
on
the
floor
and
so
escape
paying
them
no
sooner
thought
than
done
and
he
crumpled
the
cuffs
spitefully
as
he
flung
them
upon
an
unusually
dirty
floor
ever
the
heap
grew
and
though
each
bill
was
duplicated
a
thousand
times
he
found
only
one
for
two
dollars
and
a
half
which
was
what
he
owed
maria
that
meant
that
maria
would
not
press
for
payment
and
he
resolved
generously
that
it
would
be
the
only
one
he
would
pay
so
he
began
searching
through
the
heap
for
hers
he
sought
it
desperately
for
ages
and
was
still
searching
when
the
manager
of
the
hotel
entered
the
fat
dutchman
his
face
blazed
with
wrath
and
he
shouted
in
stentorian
tones
that
echoed
down
the
universe
shall
deduct
the
cost
of
those
cuffs
from
your
wages
the
pile
of
cuffs
grew
into
a
mountain
and
martin
knew
that
he
was
doomed
to
toil
for
a
thousand
years
to
pay
for
them
well
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
but
kill
the
manager
and
burn
down
the
laundry
but
the
big
dutchman
frustrated
him
seizing
him
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
dancing
him
up
and
down
he
danced
him
over
the
ironing
tables
the
stove
and
the
mangles
and
out
into
the
and
over
the
wringer
and
washer
martin
was
danced
until
his
teeth
rattled
and
his
head
ached
and
he
marvelled
that
the
dutchman
was
so
strong
and
then
he
found
himself
before
the
mangle
this
time
receiving
the
cuffs
an
editor
of
a
magazine
was
feeding
from
the
other
side
each
cuff
was
a
check
and
martin
went
over
them
anxiously
in
a
fever
of
expectation
but
they
were
all
blanks
he
stood
there
and
received
the
blanks
for
a
million
years
or
so
never
letting
one
go
by
for
fear
it
might
be
filled
out
at
last
he
found
it
with
trembling
fingers
he
held
it
to
the
light
it
was
for
five
dollars
ha
laughed
the
editor
across
the
mangle
then
i
shall
kill
you
martin
said
he
went
out
into
the
to
get
the
axe
and
found
joe
starching
manuscripts
he
tried
to
make
him
desist
then
swung
the
axe
for
him
but
the
weapon
remained
poised
in
for
martin
found
himself
back
in
the
ironing
room
in
the
midst
of
a
no
it
was
not
snow
that
was
falling
but
checks
of
large
denomination
the
smallest
not
less
than
a
thousand
dollars
he
began
to
collect
them
and
sort
them
out
in
packages
of
a
hundred
tying
each
package
securely
with
twine
he
looked
up
from
his
task
and
saw
joe
standing
before
him
juggling
starched
shirts
and
manuscripts
now
and
again
he
reached
out
and
added
a
bundle
of
checks
to
the
flying
miscellany
that
soared
through
the
roof
and
out
of
sight
in
a
tremendous
circle
martin
struck
at
him
but
he
seized
the
axe
and
added
it
to
the
flying
circle
then
he
plucked
martin
and
added
him
martin
went
up
through
the
roof
clutching
at
manuscripts
so
that
by
the
time
he
came
down
he
had
a
large
armful
but
no
sooner
down
than
up
again
and
a
second
and
a
third
time
and
countless
times
he
flew
around
the
circle
from
far
off
he
could
hear
a
childish
treble
singing
me
around
again
willie
around
around
he
recovered
the
axe
in
the
midst
of
the
milky
way
of
checks
starched
shirts
and
manuscripts
and
prepared
when
he
came
down
to
kill
joe
but
he
did
not
come
down
instead
at
two
in
the
morning
maria
having
heard
his
groans
through
the
thin
partition
came
into
his
room
to
put
hot
against
his
body
and
damp
cloths
upon
his
aching
eyes
chapter
xxvi
martin
eden
did
not
go
out
to
hunt
for
a
job
in
the
morning
it
was
late
afternoon
before
he
came
out
of
his
delirium
and
gazed
with
aching
eyes
about
the
room
mary
one
of
the
tribe
of
silva
eight
years
old
keeping
watch
raised
a
screech
at
sight
of
his
returning
consciousness
maria
hurried
into
the
room
from
the
kitchen
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
hot
forehead
and
felt
his
pulse
lika
da
eat
she
asked
he
shook
his
head
eating
was
farthest
from
his
desire
and
he
wondered
that
he
should
ever
have
been
hungry
in
his
life
sick
maria
he
said
weakly
is
it
do
you
know
she
answered
or
three
days
you
alla
da
right
better
you
no
eat
now
bimeby
plenty
can
eat
can
eat
martin
was
not
used
to
sickness
and
when
maria
and
her
little
girl
left
him
he
essayed
to
get
up
and
dress
by
a
supreme
exertion
of
will
with
rearing
brain
and
eyes
that
ached
so
that
he
could
not
keep
them
open
he
managed
to
get
out
of
bed
only
to
be
left
stranded
by
his
senses
upon
the
table
half
an
hour
later
he
managed
to
regain
the
bed
where
he
was
content
to
lie
with
closed
eyes
and
analyze
his
various
pains
and
weaknesses
maria
came
in
several
times
to
change
the
cold
cloths
on
his
forehead
otherwise
she
left
him
in
peace
too
wise
to
vex
him
with
chatter
this
moved
him
to
gratitude
and
he
murmured
to
himself
you
getta
da
milka
ranch
all
righta
all
then
he
remembered
his
past
of
yesterday
it
seemed
a
since
he
had
received
that
letter
from
the
a
since
it
was
all
over
and
done
with
and
a
new
page
turned
he
had
shot
his
bolt
and
shot
it
hard
and
now
he
was
down
on
his
back
if
he
starved
himself
he
have
been
caught
by
la
grippe
he
had
been
run
down
and
he
had
not
had
the
strength
to
throw
off
the
germ
of
disease
which
had
invaded
his
system
this
was
what
resulted
does
it
profit
a
man
to
write
a
whole
library
and
lose
his
own
life
he
demanded
aloud
is
no
place
for
me
no
more
literature
in
mine
me
for
the
and
ledger
the
monthly
salary
and
the
little
home
with
two
days
later
having
eaten
an
egg
and
two
slices
of
toast
and
drunk
a
cup
of
tea
he
asked
for
his
mail
but
found
his
eyes
still
hurt
too
much
to
permit
him
to
read
read
for
me
maria
he
said
mind
the
big
long
letters
throw
them
under
the
table
read
me
the
small
can
was
the
answer
she
go
to
school
she
so
teresa
silva
aged
nine
opened
his
letters
and
read
them
to
him
he
listened
absently
to
a
long
dun
from
the
people
his
mind
busy
with
ways
and
means
of
finding
a
job
suddenly
he
was
shocked
back
to
himself
offer
you
forty
dollars
for
all
serial
rights
in
your
story
teresa
slowly
spelled
out
you
allow
us
to
make
the
alterations
magazine
is
that
martin
shouted
give
it
to
me
he
could
see
to
read
now
and
he
was
unaware
of
the
pain
of
the
action
it
was
the
that
was
offering
him
forty
dollars
and
the
story
was
whirlpool
another
of
his
early
horror
stories
he
read
the
letter
through
again
and
again
the
editor
told
him
plainly
that
he
had
not
handled
the
idea
properly
but
that
it
was
the
idea
they
were
buying
because
it
was
original
if
they
could
cut
the
story
down
they
would
take
it
and
send
him
forty
dollars
on
receipt
of
his
answer
he
called
for
pen
and
ink
and
told
the
editor
he
could
cut
the
story
down
if
he
wanted
to
and
to
send
the
forty
dollars
right
along
the
letter
despatched
to
the
by
teresa
martin
lay
back
and
thought
it
a
lie
after
all
the
paid
on
acceptance
there
were
three
thousand
words
in
cut
down
a
third
there
would
be
two
thousand
at
forty
dollars
that
would
be
two
cents
a
word
pay
on
acceptance
and
two
cents
a
newspapers
had
told
the
truth
and
he
had
thought
the
a
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
know
the
magazines
he
had
deemed
the
a
and
it
paid
a
cent
for
ten
words
he
had
classed
the
as
of
no
account
and
it
paid
twenty
times
as
much
as
and
also
had
paid
on
acceptance
well
there
was
one
thing
certain
when
he
got
well
he
would
not
go
out
looking
for
a
job
there
were
more
stories
in
his
head
as
good
as
whirlpool
and
at
forty
dollars
apiece
he
could
earn
far
more
than
in
any
job
or
position
just
when
he
thought
the
battle
lost
it
was
won
he
had
proved
for
his
career
the
way
was
clear
beginning
with
the
he
would
add
magazine
after
magazine
to
his
growing
list
of
patrons
could
be
put
aside
for
that
matter
it
had
been
wasted
time
for
it
had
not
brought
him
a
dollar
he
would
devote
himself
to
work
good
work
and
he
would
pour
out
the
best
that
was
in
him
he
wished
ruth
was
there
to
share
in
his
joy
and
when
he
went
over
the
letters
left
lying
on
his
bed
he
found
one
from
her
it
was
sweetly
reproachful
wondering
what
had
kept
him
away
for
so
dreadful
a
length
of
time
he
reread
the
letter
adoringly
dwelling
over
her
handwriting
loving
each
stroke
of
her
pen
and
in
the
end
kissing
her
signature
and
when
he
answered
he
told
her
recklessly
that
he
had
not
been
to
see
her
because
his
best
clothes
were
in
pawn
he
told
her
that
he
had
been
sick
but
was
once
more
nearly
well
and
that
inside
ten
days
or
two
weeks
as
soon
as
a
letter
could
travel
to
new
york
city
and
return
he
would
redeem
his
clothes
and
be
with
her
but
ruth
did
not
care
to
wait
ten
days
or
two
weeks
besides
her
lover
was
sick
the
next
afternoon
accompanied
by
arthur
she
arrived
in
the
morse
carriage
to
the
unqualified
delight
of
the
silva
tribe
and
of
all
the
urchins
on
the
street
and
to
the
consternation
of
maria
she
boxed
the
ears
of
the
silvas
who
crowded
about
the
visitors
on
the
tiny
front
porch
and
in
more
than
usual
atrocious
english
tried
to
apologize
for
her
appearance
sleeves
rolled
up
from
arms
and
a
wet
around
her
waist
told
of
the
task
at
which
she
had
been
caught
so
flustered
was
she
by
two
such
grand
young
people
asking
for
her
lodger
that
she
forgot
to
invite
them
to
sit
down
in
the
little
parlor
to
enter
room
they
passed
through
the
kitchen
warm
and
moist
and
steamy
from
the
big
washing
in
progress
maria
in
her
excitement
jammed
the
bedroom
and
doors
together
and
for
five
minutes
through
the
partly
open
door
clouds
of
steam
smelling
of
and
dirt
poured
into
the
sick
chamber
ruth
succeeded
in
veering
right
and
left
and
right
again
and
in
running
the
narrow
passage
between
table
and
bed
to
side
but
arthur
veered
too
wide
and
fetched
up
with
clatter
and
bang
of
pots
and
pans
in
the
corner
where
martin
did
his
cooking
arthur
did
not
linger
long
ruth
occupied
the
only
chair
and
having
done
his
duty
he
went
outside
and
stood
by
the
gate
the
centre
of
seven
marvelling
silvas
who
watched
him
as
they
would
have
watched
a
curiosity
in
a
all
about
the
carriage
were
gathered
the
children
from
a
dozen
blocks
waiting
and
eager
for
some
tragic
and
terrible
dénouement
carriages
were
seen
on
their
street
only
for
weddings
and
funerals
here
was
neither
marriage
nor
death
therefore
it
was
something
transcending
experience
and
well
worth
waiting
for
martin
had
been
wild
to
see
ruth
his
was
essentially
a
and
he
possessed
more
than
the
average
need
for
sympathy
he
was
starving
for
sympathy
which
with
him
meant
intelligent
understanding
and
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
sympathy
was
largely
sentimental
and
tactful
and
that
it
proceeded
from
gentleness
of
nature
rather
than
from
understanding
of
the
objects
of
her
sympathy
so
it
was
while
martin
held
her
hand
and
gladly
talked
that
her
love
for
him
prompted
her
to
press
his
hand
in
return
and
that
her
eyes
were
moist
and
luminous
at
sight
of
his
helplessness
and
of
the
marks
suffering
had
stamped
upon
his
face
but
while
he
told
her
of
his
two
acceptances
of
his
despair
when
he
received
the
one
from
the
and
of
the
corresponding
delight
with
which
he
received
the
one
from
the
she
did
not
follow
him
she
heard
the
words
he
uttered
and
understood
their
literal
import
but
she
was
not
with
him
in
his
despair
and
his
delight
she
could
not
get
out
of
herself
she
was
not
interested
in
selling
stories
to
magazines
what
was
important
to
her
was
matrimony
she
was
not
aware
of
it
however
any
more
than
she
was
aware
that
her
desire
that
martin
take
a
position
was
the
instinctive
and
preparative
impulse
of
motherhood
she
would
have
blushed
had
she
been
told
as
much
in
plain
set
terms
and
next
she
might
have
grown
indignant
and
asserted
that
her
sole
interest
lay
in
the
man
she
loved
and
her
desire
for
him
to
make
the
best
of
himself
so
while
martin
poured
out
his
heart
to
her
elated
with
the
first
success
his
chosen
work
in
the
world
had
received
she
paid
heed
to
his
bare
words
only
gazing
now
and
again
about
the
room
shocked
by
what
she
saw
for
the
first
time
ruth
gazed
upon
the
sordid
face
of
poverty
starving
lovers
had
always
seemed
romantic
to
her
she
had
had
no
idea
how
starving
lovers
lived
she
had
never
dreamed
it
could
be
like
this
ever
her
gaze
shifted
from
the
room
to
him
and
back
again
the
steamy
smell
of
dirty
clothes
which
had
entered
with
her
from
the
kitchen
was
sickening
martin
must
be
soaked
with
it
ruth
concluded
if
that
awful
woman
washed
frequently
such
was
the
contagiousness
of
degradation
when
she
looked
at
martin
she
seemed
to
see
the
smirch
left
upon
him
by
his
surroundings
she
had
never
seen
him
unshaven
and
the
three
growth
of
beard
on
his
face
was
repulsive
to
her
not
alone
did
it
give
him
the
same
dark
and
murky
aspect
of
the
silva
house
inside
and
out
but
it
seemed
to
emphasize
that
strength
of
his
which
she
detested
and
here
he
was
being
confirmed
in
his
madness
by
the
two
acceptances
he
took
such
pride
in
telling
her
about
a
little
longer
and
he
would
have
surrendered
and
gone
to
work
now
he
would
continue
on
in
this
horrible
house
writing
and
starving
for
a
few
more
months
is
that
smell
she
asked
suddenly
of
washing
smells
i
imagine
was
the
answer
am
growing
quite
accustomed
to
no
not
that
it
is
something
else
a
stale
sickish
martin
sampled
the
air
before
replying
smell
anything
else
except
stale
tobacco
smoke
he
announced
it
it
is
terrible
why
do
you
smoke
so
much
martin
know
except
that
i
smoke
more
than
usual
when
i
am
lonely
and
then
too
such
a
habit
i
learned
when
i
was
only
a
is
not
a
nice
habit
you
know
she
reproved
smells
to
the
fault
of
the
tobacco
i
can
afford
only
the
cheapest
but
wait
until
i
get
that
check
use
a
brand
that
is
not
offensive
even
to
the
angels
but
that
so
bad
was
it
two
acceptances
in
three
days
that
dollars
will
pay
about
all
my
two
work
she
queried
for
less
than
a
work
please
pass
me
that
book
over
on
the
far
corner
of
the
table
the
account
book
with
the
gray
he
opened
it
and
began
turning
over
the
pages
rapidly
i
was
right
four
days
for
ring
of
bells
two
days
for
dollars
for
a
work
one
hundred
and
eighty
dollars
a
month
that
beats
any
salary
i
can
command
and
besides
just
beginning
a
thousand
dollars
a
month
is
not
too
much
to
buy
for
you
all
i
want
you
to
have
a
salary
of
five
hundred
a
month
would
be
too
small
that
dollars
is
just
a
starter
wait
till
i
get
my
stride
then
watch
my
ruth
misunderstood
his
slang
and
reverted
to
cigarettes
smoke
more
than
enough
as
it
is
and
the
brand
of
tobacco
will
make
no
difference
it
is
the
smoking
itself
that
is
not
nice
no
matter
what
the
brand
may
be
you
are
a
chimney
a
living
volcano
a
perambulating
and
you
are
a
perfect
disgrace
martin
dear
you
know
you
she
leaned
toward
him
entreaty
in
her
eyes
and
as
he
looked
at
her
delicate
face
and
into
her
pure
limpid
eyes
as
of
old
he
was
struck
with
his
own
unworthiness
wish
you
smoke
any
more
she
whispered
right
i
he
cried
do
anything
you
ask
dear
love
anything
you
know
a
great
temptation
assailed
her
in
an
insistent
way
she
had
caught
glimpses
of
the
large
side
of
his
nature
and
she
felt
sure
if
she
asked
him
to
cease
attempting
to
write
that
he
would
grant
her
wish
in
the
swift
instant
that
elapsed
the
words
trembled
on
her
lips
but
she
did
not
utter
them
she
was
not
quite
brave
enough
she
did
not
quite
dare
instead
she
leaned
toward
him
to
meet
him
and
in
his
arms
murmured
know
it
is
really
not
for
my
sake
martin
but
for
your
own
i
am
sure
smoking
hurts
you
and
besides
it
is
not
good
to
be
a
slave
to
anything
to
a
drug
least
of
shall
always
be
your
slave
he
smiled
which
case
i
shall
begin
issuing
my
she
looked
at
him
mischievously
though
deep
down
she
was
already
regretting
that
she
had
not
preferred
her
largest
request
live
but
to
obey
your
then
my
first
commandment
is
thou
shalt
not
omit
to
shave
every
day
look
how
you
have
scratched
my
and
so
it
ended
in
caresses
and
but
she
had
made
one
point
and
she
could
not
expect
to
make
more
than
one
at
a
time
she
felt
a
pride
in
that
she
had
made
him
stop
smoking
another
time
she
would
persuade
him
to
take
a
position
for
had
he
not
said
he
would
do
anything
she
asked
she
left
his
side
to
explore
the
room
examining
the
of
notes
overhead
learning
the
mystery
of
the
tackle
used
for
suspending
his
wheel
under
the
ceiling
and
being
saddened
by
the
heap
of
manuscripts
under
the
table
which
represented
to
her
just
so
much
wasted
time
the
won
her
admiration
but
on
investigating
the
food
shelves
she
found
them
empty
you
anything
to
eat
you
poor
dear
she
said
with
tender
compassion
must
be
store
my
food
in
safe
and
in
her
pantry
he
lied
keeps
better
there
no
danger
of
my
starving
look
at
she
had
come
back
to
his
side
and
she
saw
him
double
his
arm
at
the
elbow
the
biceps
crawling
under
his
and
swelling
into
a
knot
of
muscle
heavy
and
hard
the
sight
repelled
her
sentimentally
she
disliked
it
but
her
pulse
her
blood
every
fibre
of
her
loved
it
and
yearned
for
it
and
in
the
old
inexplicable
way
she
leaned
toward
him
not
away
from
him
and
in
the
moment
that
followed
when
he
crushed
her
in
his
arms
the
brain
of
her
concerned
with
the
superficial
aspects
of
life
was
in
revolt
while
the
heart
of
her
the
woman
of
her
concerned
with
life
itself
exulted
triumphantly
it
was
in
moments
like
this
that
she
felt
to
the
uttermost
the
greatness
of
her
love
for
martin
for
it
was
almost
a
swoon
of
delight
to
her
to
feel
his
strong
arms
about
her
holding
her
tightly
hurting
her
with
the
grip
of
their
fervor
at
such
moments
she
found
justification
for
her
treason
to
her
standards
for
her
violation
of
her
own
high
ideals
and
most
of
all
for
her
tacit
disobedience
to
her
mother
and
father
they
did
not
want
her
to
marry
this
man
it
shocked
them
that
she
should
love
him
it
shocked
her
too
sometimes
when
she
was
apart
from
him
a
cool
and
reasoning
creature
with
him
she
loved
truth
at
times
a
vexed
and
worried
love
but
love
it
was
a
love
that
was
stronger
than
she
la
grippe
is
nothing
he
was
saying
hurts
a
bit
and
gives
one
a
nasty
headache
but
it
compare
with
you
had
that
too
she
queried
absently
intent
on
the
justification
she
was
finding
in
his
arms
and
so
with
absent
queries
she
led
him
on
till
suddenly
his
words
startled
her
he
had
had
the
fever
in
a
secret
colony
of
thirty
lepers
on
one
of
the
hawaiian
islands
why
did
you
go
there
she
demanded
such
royal
carelessness
of
body
seemed
criminal
i
know
he
answered
never
dreamed
of
lepers
when
i
deserted
the
schooner
and
landed
on
the
beach
i
headed
inland
for
some
place
of
hiding
for
three
days
i
lived
off
guavas
and
bananas
all
of
which
grew
wild
in
the
jungle
on
the
fourth
day
i
found
the
mere
it
led
inland
and
it
led
up
it
was
the
way
i
wanted
to
go
and
it
showed
signs
of
recent
travel
at
one
place
it
ran
along
the
crest
of
a
ridge
that
was
no
more
than
a
the
trail
three
feet
wide
on
the
crest
and
on
either
side
the
ridge
fell
away
in
precipices
hundreds
of
feet
deep
one
man
with
plenty
of
ammunition
could
have
held
it
against
a
hundred
thousand
was
the
only
way
in
to
the
three
hours
after
i
found
the
trail
i
was
there
in
a
little
mountain
valley
a
pocket
in
the
midst
of
lava
peaks
the
whole
place
was
terraced
for
fruit
trees
grew
there
and
there
were
eight
or
ten
grass
huts
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
inhabitants
i
knew
what
struck
one
sight
of
them
was
did
you
do
ruth
demanded
breathlessly
listening
like
any
desdemona
appalled
and
fascinated
for
me
to
do
their
leader
was
a
kind
old
fellow
pretty
far
gone
but
he
ruled
like
a
king
he
had
discovered
the
little
valley
and
founded
the
of
which
was
against
the
law
but
he
had
guns
plenty
of
ammunition
and
those
kanakas
trained
to
the
shooting
of
wild
cattle
and
wild
pig
were
dead
shots
no
there
any
running
away
for
martin
eden
he
three
how
did
you
escape
have
been
there
yet
if
it
been
for
a
girl
there
a
and
she
was
a
beauty
poor
thing
and
well
educated
her
mother
in
honolulu
was
worth
a
million
or
so
well
this
girl
got
me
away
at
last
her
mother
financed
the
settlement
you
see
so
the
girl
afraid
of
being
punished
for
letting
me
go
but
she
made
me
swear
first
never
to
reveal
the
and
i
never
have
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
even
mentioned
it
the
girl
had
just
the
first
signs
of
leprosy
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
were
slightly
twisted
and
there
was
a
small
spot
on
her
arm
that
was
all
i
guess
she
is
dead
you
frightened
and
you
glad
to
get
away
without
catching
that
dreadful
disease
he
confessed
was
a
bit
shivery
at
first
but
i
got
used
to
it
i
used
to
feel
sorry
for
that
poor
girl
though
that
made
me
forget
to
be
afraid
she
was
such
a
beauty
in
spirit
as
well
as
in
appearance
and
she
was
only
slightly
touched
yet
she
was
doomed
to
lie
there
living
the
life
of
a
primitive
savage
and
rotting
slowly
away
leprosy
is
far
more
terrible
than
you
can
imagine
thing
ruth
murmured
softly
a
wonder
she
let
you
get
do
you
mean
martin
asked
unwittingly
she
must
have
loved
you
ruth
said
still
softly
now
she
sunburn
had
been
bleached
by
his
work
in
the
laundry
and
by
the
indoor
life
he
was
living
while
the
hunger
and
the
sickness
had
made
his
face
even
pale
and
across
this
pallor
flowed
the
slow
wave
of
a
blush
he
was
opening
his
mouth
to
speak
but
ruth
shut
him
off
mind
answer
not
necessary
she
laughed
but
it
seemed
to
him
there
was
something
metallic
in
her
laughter
and
that
the
light
in
her
eyes
was
cold
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
it
reminded
him
of
a
gale
he
had
once
experienced
in
the
north
pacific
and
for
the
moment
the
apparition
of
the
gale
rose
before
his
gale
at
night
with
a
clear
sky
and
under
a
full
moon
the
huge
seas
glinting
coldly
in
the
moonlight
next
he
saw
the
girl
in
the
leper
refuge
and
remembered
it
was
for
love
of
him
that
she
had
let
him
go
was
noble
he
said
simply
gave
me
that
was
all
of
the
incident
but
he
heard
ruth
muffle
a
dry
sob
in
her
throat
and
noticed
that
she
turned
her
face
away
to
gaze
out
of
the
window
when
she
turned
it
back
to
him
it
was
composed
and
there
was
no
hint
of
the
gale
in
her
eyes
such
a
silly
she
said
plaintively
i
help
it
i
do
so
love
you
martin
i
do
i
do
i
shall
grow
more
catholic
in
time
but
at
present
i
help
being
jealous
of
those
ghosts
of
the
past
and
you
know
your
past
is
full
of
must
be
she
silenced
his
protest
could
not
be
otherwise
and
poor
arthur
motioning
me
to
come
tired
waiting
and
now
some
kind
of
a
mixture
put
up
by
the
druggists
that
helps
men
to
stop
the
use
of
tobacco
she
called
back
from
the
door
i
am
going
to
send
you
the
door
closed
but
opened
again
do
i
do
she
whispered
to
him
and
this
time
she
was
really
gone
maria
with
worshipful
eyes
that
none
the
less
were
keen
to
note
the
texture
of
garments
and
the
cut
of
them
a
cut
unknown
that
produced
an
effect
mysteriously
beautiful
saw
her
to
the
carriage
the
crowd
of
disappointed
urchins
stared
till
the
carriage
disappeared
from
view
then
transferred
their
stare
to
maria
who
had
abruptly
become
the
most
important
person
on
the
street
but
it
was
one
of
her
progeny
who
blasted
reputation
by
announcing
that
the
grand
visitors
had
been
for
her
lodger
after
that
maria
dropped
back
into
her
old
obscurity
and
martin
began
to
notice
the
respectful
manner
in
which
he
was
regarded
by
the
small
fry
of
the
neighborhood
as
for
maria
martin
rose
in
her
estimation
a
full
hundred
per
cent
and
had
the
portuguese
grocer
witnessed
that
afternoon
he
would
have
allowed
martin
an
additional
worth
of
credit
chapter
xxvii
the
sun
of
good
fortune
rose
the
day
after
visit
he
received
a
check
for
three
dollars
from
a
new
york
scandal
weekly
in
payment
for
three
of
his
triolets
two
days
later
a
newspaper
published
in
chicago
accepted
his
hunters
promising
to
pay
ten
dollars
for
it
on
publication
the
price
was
small
but
it
was
the
first
article
he
had
written
his
very
first
attempt
to
express
his
thought
on
the
printed
page
to
cap
everything
the
adventure
serial
for
boys
his
second
attempt
was
accepted
before
the
end
of
the
week
by
a
juvenile
monthly
calling
itself
and
it
was
true
the
serial
was
thousand
words
and
they
offered
to
pay
him
sixteen
dollars
on
publication
which
was
something
like
cents
a
thousand
words
but
it
was
equally
true
that
it
was
the
second
thing
he
had
attempted
to
write
and
that
he
was
himself
thoroughly
aware
of
its
clumsy
worthlessness
but
even
his
earliest
efforts
were
not
marked
with
the
clumsiness
of
mediocrity
what
characterized
them
was
the
clumsiness
of
too
great
clumsiness
which
the
tyro
betrays
when
he
crushes
butterflies
with
battering
rams
and
hammers
out
vignettes
with
a
so
it
was
that
martin
was
glad
to
sell
his
early
efforts
for
songs
he
knew
them
for
what
they
were
and
it
had
not
taken
him
long
to
acquire
this
knowledge
what
he
pinned
his
faith
to
was
his
later
work
he
had
striven
to
be
something
more
than
a
mere
writer
of
magazine
fiction
he
had
sought
to
equip
himself
with
the
tools
of
artistry
on
the
other
hand
he
had
not
sacrificed
strength
his
conscious
aim
had
been
to
increase
his
strength
by
avoiding
excess
of
strength
nor
had
he
departed
from
his
love
of
reality
his
work
was
realism
though
he
had
endeavored
to
fuse
with
it
the
fancies
and
beauties
of
imagination
what
he
sought
was
an
impassioned
realism
shot
through
with
human
aspiration
and
faith
what
he
wanted
was
life
as
it
was
with
all
its
and
left
in
he
had
discovered
in
the
course
of
his
reading
two
schools
of
fiction
one
treated
of
man
as
a
god
ignoring
his
earthly
origin
the
other
treated
of
man
as
a
clod
ignoring
his
dreams
and
divine
possibilities
both
the
god
and
the
clod
schools
erred
in
estimation
and
erred
through
too
great
singleness
of
sight
and
purpose
there
was
a
compromise
that
approximated
the
truth
though
it
flattered
not
the
school
of
god
while
it
challenged
the
of
the
school
of
clod
it
was
his
story
which
had
dragged
with
ruth
that
martin
believed
had
achieved
his
ideal
of
the
true
in
fiction
and
it
was
in
an
essay
and
clod
that
he
had
expressed
his
views
on
the
whole
general
subject
but
and
all
that
he
deemed
his
best
work
still
went
begging
among
the
editors
his
early
work
counted
for
nothing
in
his
eyes
except
for
the
money
it
brought
and
his
horror
stories
two
of
which
he
had
sold
he
did
not
consider
high
work
nor
his
best
work
to
him
they
were
frankly
imaginative
and
fantastic
though
invested
with
all
the
glamour
of
the
real
wherein
lay
their
power
this
investiture
of
the
grotesque
and
impossible
with
reality
he
looked
upon
as
a
skilful
trick
at
best
great
literature
could
not
reside
in
such
a
field
their
artistry
was
high
but
he
denied
the
worthwhileness
of
artistry
when
divorced
from
humanness
the
trick
had
been
to
fling
over
the
face
of
his
artistry
a
mask
of
humanness
and
this
he
had
done
in
the
or
so
stories
of
the
horror
brand
he
had
written
before
he
emerged
upon
the
high
peaks
of
pot
and
wine
of
the
three
dollars
he
received
for
the
triolets
he
used
to
eke
out
a
precarious
existence
against
the
arrival
of
the
check
he
cashed
the
first
check
with
the
suspicious
portuguese
grocer
paying
a
dollar
on
account
and
dividing
the
remaining
two
dollars
between
the
baker
and
the
fruit
store
martin
was
not
yet
rich
enough
to
afford
meat
and
he
was
on
slim
allowance
when
the
check
arrived
he
was
divided
on
the
cashing
of
it
he
had
never
been
in
a
bank
in
his
life
much
less
been
in
one
on
business
and
he
had
a
naive
and
childlike
desire
to
walk
into
one
of
the
big
banks
down
in
oakland
and
fling
down
his
indorsed
check
for
forty
dollars
on
the
other
hand
practical
common
sense
ruled
that
he
should
cash
it
with
his
grocer
and
thereby
make
an
impression
that
would
later
result
in
an
increase
of
credit
reluctantly
martin
yielded
to
the
claims
of
the
grocer
paying
his
bill
with
him
in
full
and
receiving
in
change
a
pocketful
of
jingling
coin
also
he
paid
the
other
tradesmen
in
full
redeemed
his
suit
and
his
bicycle
paid
one
rent
on
the
and
paid
maria
the
overdue
month
for
his
room
and
a
month
in
advance
this
left
him
in
his
pocket
for
emergencies
a
balance
of
nearly
three
dollars
in
itself
this
small
sum
seemed
a
fortune
immediately
on
recovering
his
clothes
he
had
gone
to
see
ruth
and
on
the
way
he
could
not
refrain
from
jingling
the
little
handful
of
silver
in
his
pocket
he
had
been
so
long
without
money
that
like
a
rescued
starving
man
who
can
not
let
the
unconsumed
food
out
of
his
sight
martin
could
not
keep
his
hand
off
the
silver
he
was
not
mean
nor
avaricious
but
the
money
meant
more
than
so
many
dollars
and
cents
it
stood
for
success
and
the
eagles
stamped
upon
the
coins
were
to
him
so
many
winged
victories
it
came
to
him
insensibly
that
it
was
a
very
good
world
it
certainly
appeared
more
beautiful
to
him
for
weeks
it
had
been
a
very
dull
and
sombre
world
but
now
with
nearly
all
debts
paid
three
dollars
jingling
in
his
pocket
and
in
his
mind
the
consciousness
of
success
the
sun
shone
bright
and
warm
and
even
a
that
soaked
unprepared
pedestrians
seemed
a
merry
happening
to
him
when
he
starved
his
thoughts
had
dwelt
often
upon
the
thousands
he
knew
were
starving
the
world
over
but
now
that
he
was
feasted
full
the
fact
of
the
thousands
starving
was
no
longer
pregnant
in
his
brain
he
forgot
about
them
and
being
in
love
remembered
the
countless
lovers
in
the
world
without
deliberately
thinking
about
it
for
began
to
agitate
his
brain
swept
away
by
the
creative
impulse
he
got
off
the
electric
car
without
vexation
two
blocks
beyond
his
crossing
he
found
a
number
of
persons
in
the
morse
home
two
were
visiting
her
from
san
rafael
and
morse
under
pretext
of
entertaining
them
was
pursuing
her
plan
of
surrounding
ruth
with
young
people
the
campaign
had
begun
during
enforced
absence
and
was
already
in
full
swing
she
was
making
a
point
of
having
at
the
house
men
who
were
doing
things
thus
in
addition
to
the
cousins
dorothy
and
florence
martin
encountered
two
university
professors
one
of
latin
the
other
of
english
a
young
army
officer
just
back
from
the
philippines
of
a
young
fellow
named
melville
private
secretary
to
joseph
perkins
head
of
the
san
francisco
trust
company
and
finally
of
the
men
a
live
bank
cashier
charles
hapgood
a
youngish
man
of
graduate
of
stanford
university
member
of
the
nile
club
and
the
unity
club
and
a
conservative
speaker
for
the
republican
party
during
short
a
rising
young
man
in
every
way
among
the
women
was
one
who
painted
portraits
another
who
was
a
professional
musician
and
still
another
who
possessed
the
degree
of
doctor
of
sociology
and
who
was
locally
famous
for
her
social
settlement
work
in
the
slums
of
san
francisco
but
the
women
did
not
count
for
much
in
plan
at
the
best
they
were
necessary
accessories
the
men
who
did
things
must
be
drawn
to
the
house
somehow
get
excited
when
you
talk
ruth
admonished
martin
before
the
ordeal
of
introduction
began
he
bore
himself
a
bit
stiffly
at
first
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
his
own
awkwardness
especially
of
his
shoulders
which
were
up
to
their
old
trick
of
threatening
destruction
to
furniture
and
ornaments
also
he
was
rendered
by
the
company
he
had
never
before
been
in
contact
with
such
exalted
beings
nor
with
so
many
of
them
melville
the
bank
cashier
fascinated
him
and
he
resolved
to
investigate
him
at
the
first
opportunity
for
underneath
awe
lurked
his
assertive
ego
and
he
felt
the
urge
to
measure
himself
with
these
men
and
women
and
to
find
out
what
they
had
learned
from
the
books
and
life
which
he
had
not
learned
eyes
roved
to
him
frequently
to
see
how
he
was
getting
on
and
she
was
surprised
and
gladdened
by
the
ease
with
which
he
got
acquainted
with
her
cousins
he
certainly
did
not
grow
excited
while
being
seated
removed
from
him
the
worry
of
his
shoulders
ruth
knew
them
for
clever
girls
superficially
brilliant
and
she
could
scarcely
understand
their
praise
of
martin
later
that
night
at
going
to
bed
but
he
on
the
other
hand
a
wit
in
his
own
class
a
gay
quizzer
and
at
dances
and
sunday
picnics
had
found
the
making
of
fun
and
the
breaking
of
lances
simple
enough
in
this
environment
and
on
this
evening
success
stood
at
his
back
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
and
telling
him
that
he
was
making
good
so
that
he
could
afford
to
laugh
and
make
laughter
and
remain
unabashed
later
anxiety
found
justification
martin
and
professor
caldwell
had
got
together
in
a
conspicuous
corner
and
though
martin
no
longer
wove
the
air
with
his
hands
to
critical
eye
he
permitted
his
own
eyes
to
flash
and
glitter
too
frequently
talked
too
rapidly
and
warmly
grew
too
intense
and
allowed
his
aroused
blood
to
redden
his
cheeks
too
much
he
lacked
decorum
and
control
and
was
in
decided
contrast
to
the
young
professor
of
english
with
whom
he
talked
but
martin
was
not
concerned
with
appearances
he
had
been
swift
to
note
the
trained
mind
and
to
appreciate
his
command
of
knowledge
furthermore
professor
caldwell
did
not
realize
concept
of
the
average
english
professor
martin
wanted
him
to
talk
shop
and
though
he
seemed
averse
at
first
succeeded
in
making
him
do
it
for
martin
did
not
see
why
a
man
should
not
talk
shop
absurd
and
unfair
he
had
told
ruth
weeks
before
objection
to
talking
shop
for
what
reason
under
the
sun
do
men
and
women
come
together
if
not
for
the
exchange
of
the
best
that
is
in
them
and
the
best
that
is
in
them
is
what
they
are
interested
in
the
thing
by
which
they
make
their
living
the
thing
specialized
on
and
sat
up
days
and
nights
over
and
even
dreamed
about
imagine
butler
living
up
to
social
etiquette
and
enunciating
his
views
on
paul
verlaine
or
the
german
drama
or
the
novels
of
be
bored
to
death
i
for
one
if
i
must
listen
to
butler
prefer
to
hear
him
talk
about
his
law
the
best
that
is
in
him
and
life
is
so
short
that
i
want
the
best
of
every
man
and
woman
i
ruth
had
objected
are
the
topics
of
general
interest
to
you
mistake
he
had
rushed
on
persons
in
society
all
cliques
in
rather
nearly
all
persons
and
their
betters
now
who
are
the
best
betters
the
idlers
the
wealthy
idlers
they
do
not
know
as
a
rule
the
things
known
by
the
persons
who
are
doing
something
in
the
world
to
listen
to
conversation
about
such
things
would
mean
to
be
bored
wherefore
the
idlers
decree
that
such
things
are
shop
and
must
not
be
talked
about
likewise
they
decree
the
things
that
are
not
shop
and
which
may
be
talked
about
and
those
things
are
the
latest
operas
latest
novels
cards
billiards
cocktails
automobiles
horse
shows
trout
fishing
shooting
yacht
sailing
and
so
mark
you
these
are
the
things
the
idlers
know
in
all
truth
they
constitute
the
of
the
idlers
and
the
funniest
part
of
it
is
that
many
of
the
clever
people
and
all
the
clever
people
allow
the
idlers
so
to
impose
upon
them
as
for
me
i
want
the
best
a
got
in
him
call
it
shop
vulgarity
or
anything
you
and
ruth
had
not
understood
this
attack
of
his
on
the
established
had
seemed
to
her
just
so
much
wilfulness
of
opinion
so
martin
contaminated
professor
caldwell
with
his
own
earnestness
challenging
him
to
speak
his
mind
as
ruth
paused
beside
them
she
heard
martin
saying
surely
pronounce
such
heresies
in
the
university
of
california
professor
caldwell
shrugged
his
shoulders
honest
taxpayer
and
the
politician
you
know
sacramento
gives
us
our
appropriations
and
therefore
we
kowtow
to
sacramento
and
to
the
board
of
regents
and
to
the
party
press
or
to
the
press
of
both
clear
but
how
about
you
martin
urged
must
be
a
fish
out
of
the
like
me
i
imagine
in
the
university
pond
sometimes
i
am
fairly
sure
i
am
out
of
water
and
that
i
should
belong
in
paris
in
grub
street
in
a
cave
or
in
some
sadly
wild
bohemian
crowd
drinking
claret
they
call
it
in
san
francisco
in
cheap
restaurants
in
the
latin
quarter
and
expressing
vociferously
radical
views
upon
all
creation
really
i
am
frequently
almost
sure
that
i
was
cut
out
to
be
a
radical
but
then
there
are
so
many
questions
on
which
i
am
not
sure
i
grow
timid
when
i
am
face
to
face
with
my
human
frailty
which
ever
prevents
me
from
grasping
all
the
factors
in
any
vital
problems
you
and
as
he
talked
on
martin
became
aware
that
to
his
own
lips
had
come
the
of
the
trade
am
strongest
at
noon
but
under
the
moon
i
stiffen
the
bunt
of
the
he
was
almost
humming
the
words
and
it
dawned
upon
him
that
the
other
reminded
him
of
the
trade
wind
of
the
northeast
trade
steady
and
cool
and
strong
he
was
equable
he
was
to
be
relied
upon
and
withal
there
was
a
certain
bafflement
about
him
martin
had
the
feeling
that
he
never
spoke
his
full
mind
just
as
he
had
often
had
the
feeling
that
the
trades
never
blew
their
strongest
but
always
held
reserves
of
strength
that
were
never
used
trick
of
visioning
was
active
as
ever
his
brain
was
a
most
accessible
storehouse
of
remembered
fact
and
fancy
and
its
contents
seemed
ever
ordered
and
spread
for
his
inspection
whatever
occurred
in
the
instant
present
mind
immediately
presented
associated
antithesis
or
similitude
which
ordinarily
expressed
themselves
to
him
in
vision
it
was
sheerly
automatic
and
his
visioning
was
an
unfailing
accompaniment
to
the
living
present
just
as
face
in
a
momentary
jealousy
had
called
before
his
eyes
a
forgotten
moonlight
gale
and
as
professor
caldwell
made
him
see
again
the
northeast
trade
herding
the
white
billows
across
the
purple
sea
so
from
moment
to
moment
not
disconcerting
but
rather
identifying
and
classifying
new
rose
before
him
or
spread
under
his
eyelids
or
were
thrown
upon
the
screen
of
his
consciousness
these
visions
came
out
of
the
actions
and
sensations
of
the
past
out
of
things
and
events
and
books
of
yesterday
and
last
countless
host
of
apparitions
that
waking
or
sleeping
forever
thronged
his
mind
so
it
was
as
he
listened
to
professor
easy
flow
of
conversation
of
a
clever
cultured
martin
kept
seeing
himself
down
all
his
past
he
saw
himself
when
he
had
been
quite
the
hoodlum
wearing
a
stetson
hat
and
a
coat
with
a
certain
swagger
to
the
shoulders
and
possessing
the
ideal
of
being
as
tough
as
the
police
permitted
he
did
not
disguise
it
to
himself
nor
attempt
to
palliate
it
at
one
time
in
his
life
he
had
been
just
a
common
hoodlum
the
leader
of
a
gang
that
worried
the
police
and
terrorized
honest
householders
but
his
ideals
had
changed
he
glanced
about
him
at
the
men
and
women
and
breathed
into
his
lungs
the
atmosphere
of
culture
and
refinement
and
at
the
same
moment
the
ghost
of
his
early
youth
in
and
with
swagger
and
toughness
stalked
across
the
room
this
figure
of
the
corner
hoodlum
he
saw
merge
into
himself
sitting
and
talking
with
an
actual
university
professor
for
after
all
he
had
never
found
his
permanent
abiding
place
he
had
fitted
in
wherever
he
found
himself
been
a
favorite
always
and
everywhere
by
virtue
of
holding
his
own
at
work
and
at
play
and
by
his
willingness
and
ability
to
fight
for
his
rights
and
command
respect
but
he
had
never
taken
root
he
had
fitted
in
sufficiently
to
satisfy
his
fellows
but
not
to
satisfy
himself
he
had
been
perturbed
always
by
a
feeling
of
unrest
had
heard
always
the
call
of
something
from
beyond
and
had
wandered
on
through
life
seeking
it
until
he
found
books
and
art
and
love
and
here
he
was
in
the
midst
of
all
this
the
only
one
of
all
the
comrades
he
had
adventured
with
who
could
have
made
themselves
eligible
for
the
inside
of
the
morse
home
but
such
thoughts
and
visions
did
not
prevent
him
from
following
professor
caldwell
closely
and
as
he
followed
comprehendingly
and
critically
he
noted
the
unbroken
field
of
the
knowledge
as
for
himself
from
moment
to
moment
the
conversation
showed
him
gaps
and
open
stretches
whole
subjects
with
which
he
was
unfamiliar
nevertheless
thanks
to
his
spencer
he
saw
that
he
possessed
the
outlines
of
the
field
of
knowledge
it
was
a
matter
only
of
time
when
he
would
fill
in
the
outline
then
watch
out
he
shoal
everybody
he
felt
like
sitting
at
the
feet
of
the
professor
worshipful
and
absorbent
but
as
he
listened
he
began
to
discern
a
weakness
in
the
weakness
so
stray
and
elusive
that
he
might
not
have
caught
it
had
it
not
been
ever
present
and
when
he
did
catch
it
he
leapt
to
equality
at
once
ruth
came
up
to
them
a
second
time
just
as
martin
began
to
speak
tell
you
where
you
are
wrong
or
rather
what
weakens
your
judgments
he
said
lack
biology
it
has
no
place
in
your
scheme
of
i
mean
the
real
interpretative
biology
from
the
ground
up
from
the
laboratory
and
the
and
the
vitalized
inorganic
right
on
up
to
the
widest
aesthetic
and
sociological
ruth
was
appalled
she
had
sat
two
lecture
courses
under
professor
caldwell
and
looked
up
to
him
as
the
living
repository
of
all
knowledge
scarcely
follow
you
he
said
dubiously
martin
was
not
so
sure
but
what
he
had
followed
him
try
to
explain
he
said
remember
reading
in
egyptian
history
something
to
the
effect
that
understanding
could
not
be
had
of
egyptian
art
without
first
studying
the
land
right
the
professor
nodded
it
seems
to
me
martin
continued
knowledge
of
the
land
question
in
turn
of
all
questions
for
that
matter
can
not
be
had
without
previous
knowledge
of
the
stuff
and
the
constitution
of
life
how
can
we
understand
laws
and
institutions
religions
and
customs
without
understanding
not
merely
the
nature
of
the
creatures
that
made
them
but
the
nature
of
the
stuff
out
of
which
the
creatures
are
made
is
literature
less
human
than
the
architecture
and
sculpture
of
egypt
is
there
one
thing
in
the
known
universe
that
is
not
subject
to
the
law
of
evolution
i
know
there
is
an
elaborate
evolution
of
the
various
arts
laid
down
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
too
mechanical
the
human
himself
is
left
out
the
evolution
of
the
tool
of
the
harp
of
music
and
song
and
dance
are
all
beautifully
elaborated
but
how
about
the
evolution
of
the
human
himself
the
development
of
the
basic
and
intrinsic
parts
that
were
in
him
before
he
made
his
first
tool
or
gibbered
his
first
chant
it
is
that
which
you
do
not
consider
and
which
i
call
biology
it
is
biology
in
its
largest
aspects
know
i
express
myself
incoherently
but
tried
to
hammer
out
the
idea
it
came
to
me
as
you
were
talking
so
i
was
not
primed
and
ready
to
deliver
it
you
spoke
yourself
of
the
human
frailty
that
prevented
one
from
taking
all
the
factors
into
consideration
and
you
in
turn
so
it
seems
to
me
out
the
biological
factor
the
very
stuff
out
of
which
has
been
spun
the
fabric
of
all
the
arts
the
warp
and
the
woof
of
all
human
actions
and
to
amazement
martin
was
not
immediately
crushed
and
that
the
professor
replied
in
the
way
he
did
struck
her
as
forbearance
for
youth
professor
caldwell
sat
for
a
full
minute
silent
and
fingering
his
watch
chain
you
know
he
said
at
last
had
that
same
criticism
passed
on
me
once
a
very
great
man
a
scientist
and
evolutionist
joseph
le
conte
but
he
is
dead
and
i
thought
to
remain
undetected
and
now
you
come
along
and
expose
me
seriously
this
is
think
there
is
something
in
your
great
deal
in
fact
i
am
too
classical
not
enough
in
the
interpretative
branches
of
science
and
i
can
only
plead
the
disadvantages
of
my
education
and
a
temperamental
slothfulness
that
prevents
me
from
doing
the
work
i
wonder
if
believe
that
never
been
inside
a
physics
or
chemistry
laboratory
it
is
true
nevertheless
le
conte
was
right
and
so
are
you
eden
at
least
to
an
much
i
do
not
ruth
drew
martin
away
with
her
on
a
pretext
when
she
had
got
him
aside
whispering
have
monopolized
professor
caldwell
that
way
there
may
be
others
who
want
to
talk
with
mistake
martin
admitted
contritely
got
him
stirred
up
and
he
was
so
interesting
that
i
did
not
think
do
you
know
he
is
the
brightest
the
most
intellectual
man
i
have
ever
talked
with
and
tell
you
something
else
i
once
thought
that
everybody
who
went
to
universities
or
who
sat
in
the
high
places
in
society
was
just
as
brilliant
and
intelligent
as
an
exception
she
answered
should
say
so
whom
do
you
want
me
to
talk
to
now
say
bring
me
up
against
that
martin
talked
for
fifteen
minutes
with
him
nor
could
ruth
have
wished
better
behavior
on
her
part
not
once
did
his
eyes
flash
nor
his
cheeks
flush
while
the
calmness
and
poise
with
which
he
talked
surprised
her
but
in
estimation
the
whole
tribe
of
bank
cashiers
fell
a
few
hundred
per
cent
and
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
he
labored
under
the
impression
that
bank
cashiers
and
talkers
of
platitudes
were
synonymous
phrases
the
army
officer
he
found
and
simple
a
healthy
wholesome
young
fellow
content
to
occupy
the
place
in
life
into
which
birth
and
luck
had
flung
him
on
learning
that
he
had
completed
two
years
in
the
university
martin
was
puzzled
to
know
where
he
had
stored
it
away
nevertheless
martin
liked
him
better
than
the
platitudinous
bank
cashier
really
object
to
platitudes
he
told
ruth
later
what
worries
me
into
nervousness
is
the
pompous
smugly
complacent
superior
certitude
with
which
they
are
uttered
and
the
time
taken
to
do
it
why
i
could
give
that
man
the
whole
history
of
the
reformation
in
the
time
he
took
to
tell
me
that
the
party
had
fused
with
the
democrats
do
you
know
he
skins
his
words
as
a
professional
skins
the
cards
that
are
dealt
out
to
him
some
day
show
you
what
i
sorry
you
like
him
was
her
reply
a
favorite
of
butler
says
he
is
safe
and
him
the
rock
peter
and
says
that
upon
him
any
banking
institution
can
well
be
doubt
the
little
i
saw
of
him
and
the
less
i
heard
from
him
but
i
think
so
much
of
banks
as
i
did
you
mind
my
speaking
my
mind
this
way
dear
no
it
is
most
martin
went
on
heartily
no
more
than
a
barbarian
getting
my
first
impressions
of
civilization
such
impressions
must
be
entertainingly
novel
to
the
civilized
did
you
think
of
my
cousins
ruth
queried
liked
them
better
than
the
other
women
plenty
of
fun
in
them
along
with
paucity
of
you
did
like
the
other
women
he
shook
his
head
woman
is
no
more
than
a
sociological
i
swear
if
you
winnowed
her
out
between
the
stars
like
tomlinson
there
would
be
found
in
her
not
one
original
thought
as
for
the
she
was
a
positive
bore
make
a
good
wife
for
the
cashier
and
the
musician
woman
i
care
how
nimble
her
fingers
are
how
perfect
her
technique
how
wonderful
her
fact
is
she
knows
nothing
about
plays
beautifully
ruth
protested
undoubtedly
gymnastic
in
the
externals
of
music
but
the
intrinsic
spirit
of
music
is
unguessed
by
her
i
asked
her
what
music
meant
to
know
always
curious
to
know
that
particular
thing
and
she
did
not
know
what
it
meant
to
her
except
that
she
adored
it
that
it
was
the
greatest
of
the
arts
and
that
it
meant
more
than
life
to
were
making
them
talk
shop
ruth
charged
him
confess
it
and
if
they
were
failures
on
shop
imagine
my
sufferings
if
they
had
discoursed
on
other
subjects
why
i
used
to
think
that
up
here
where
all
the
advantages
of
culture
were
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
watched
the
youthful
shade
of
himself
in
and
enter
the
door
and
swagger
across
the
room
i
was
saying
up
here
i
thought
all
men
and
women
were
brilliant
and
radiant
but
now
from
what
little
seen
of
them
they
strike
me
as
a
pack
of
ninnies
most
of
them
and
ninety
percent
of
the
remainder
as
bores
now
professor
different
a
man
every
inch
of
him
and
every
atom
of
his
gray
face
brightened
me
about
him
she
urged
what
is
large
and
know
those
qualities
but
whatever
you
feel
is
adverse
i
am
most
curious
to
get
myself
in
a
martin
debated
humorously
for
a
moment
you
tell
me
first
or
maybe
you
find
in
him
nothing
less
than
the
attended
two
lecture
courses
under
him
and
i
have
known
him
for
two
years
that
is
why
i
am
anxious
for
your
first
impression
you
mean
well
here
goes
he
is
all
the
fine
things
you
think
about
him
i
guess
at
least
he
is
the
finest
specimen
of
intellectual
man
i
have
met
but
he
is
a
man
with
a
secret
no
no
he
hastened
to
cry
paltry
nor
vulgar
what
i
mean
is
that
he
strikes
me
as
a
man
who
has
gone
to
the
bottom
of
things
and
is
so
afraid
of
what
he
saw
that
he
makes
believe
to
himself
that
he
never
saw
it
perhaps
not
the
clearest
way
to
express
it
another
way
a
man
who
has
found
the
path
to
the
hidden
temple
but
has
not
followed
it
who
has
perhaps
caught
glimpses
of
the
temple
and
striven
afterward
to
convince
himself
that
it
was
only
a
mirage
of
foliage
yet
another
way
a
man
who
could
have
done
things
but
who
placed
no
value
on
the
doing
and
who
all
the
time
in
his
innermost
heart
is
regretting
that
he
has
not
done
them
who
has
secretly
laughed
at
the
rewards
for
doing
and
yet
still
more
secretly
has
yearned
for
the
rewards
and
for
the
joy
of
read
him
that
way
she
said
for
that
matter
i
see
just
what
you
is
only
a
vague
feeling
on
my
part
martin
temporized
have
no
reason
for
it
it
is
only
a
feeling
and
most
likely
it
is
wrong
you
certainly
should
know
him
better
than
from
the
evening
at
martin
brought
away
with
him
strange
confusions
and
conflicting
feelings
he
was
disappointed
in
his
goal
in
the
persons
he
had
climbed
to
be
with
on
the
other
hand
he
was
encouraged
with
his
success
the
climb
had
been
easier
than
he
expected
he
was
superior
to
the
climb
and
he
did
not
with
false
modesty
hide
it
from
himself
he
was
superior
to
the
beings
among
whom
he
had
the
exception
of
course
of
professor
caldwell
about
life
and
the
books
he
knew
more
than
they
and
he
wondered
into
what
nooks
and
crannies
they
had
cast
aside
their
educations
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
himself
possessed
of
unusual
brain
vigor
nor
did
he
know
that
the
persons
who
were
given
to
probing
the
depths
and
to
thinking
ultimate
thoughts
were
not
to
be
found
in
the
drawing
rooms
of
the
morses
nor
did
he
dream
that
such
persons
were
as
lonely
eagles
sailing
solitary
in
the
azure
sky
far
above
the
earth
and
its
swarming
freight
of
gregarious
life
chapter
xxviii
but
success
had
lost
address
and
her
messengers
no
longer
came
to
his
door
for
days
working
sundays
and
holidays
he
toiled
on
shame
of
the
sun
a
long
essay
of
some
thirty
thousand
words
it
was
a
deliberate
attack
on
the
mysticism
of
the
maeterlinck
attack
from
the
citadel
of
positive
science
upon
the
but
an
attack
nevertheless
that
retained
much
of
beauty
and
wonder
of
the
sort
compatible
with
ascertained
fact
it
was
a
little
later
that
he
followed
up
the
attack
with
two
short
essays
and
yardstick
of
the
and
on
essays
long
and
short
he
began
to
pay
the
travelling
expenses
from
magazine
to
magazine
during
the
days
spent
on
shame
of
the
sun
he
sold
to
the
extent
of
six
dollars
and
fifty
cents
a
joke
had
brought
in
fifty
cents
and
a
second
one
sold
to
a
comic
weekly
had
fetched
a
dollar
then
two
humorous
poems
had
earned
two
dollars
and
three
dollars
respectively
as
a
result
having
exhausted
his
credit
with
the
tradesmen
though
he
had
increased
his
credit
with
the
grocer
to
five
dollars
his
wheel
and
suit
of
clothes
went
back
to
the
pawnbroker
the
people
were
again
clamoring
for
money
insistently
pointing
out
that
according
to
the
agreement
rent
was
to
be
paid
strictly
in
advance
encouraged
by
his
several
small
sales
martin
went
back
to
perhaps
there
was
a
living
in
it
after
all
stored
away
under
his
table
were
the
twenty
storiettes
which
had
been
rejected
by
the
newspaper
syndicate
he
read
them
over
in
order
to
find
out
how
not
to
write
newspaper
storiettes
and
so
doing
reasoned
out
the
perfect
formula
he
found
that
the
newspaper
storiette
should
never
be
tragic
should
never
end
unhappily
and
should
never
contain
beauty
of
language
subtlety
of
thought
nor
real
delicacy
of
sentiment
sentiment
it
must
contain
plenty
of
it
pure
and
noble
of
the
sort
that
in
his
own
early
youth
had
brought
his
applause
from
and
brand
of
sentiment
having
learned
such
precautions
martin
consulted
for
tone
and
proceeded
to
mix
according
to
formula
the
formula
consists
of
three
parts
a
pair
of
lovers
are
jarred
apart
by
some
deed
or
event
they
are
reunited
marriage
bells
the
third
part
was
an
unvarying
quantity
but
the
first
and
second
parts
could
be
varied
an
infinite
number
of
times
thus
the
pair
of
lovers
could
be
jarred
apart
by
misunderstood
motives
by
accident
of
fate
by
jealous
rivals
by
irate
parents
by
crafty
guardians
by
scheming
relatives
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
they
could
be
reunited
by
a
brave
deed
of
the
man
lover
by
a
similar
deed
of
the
woman
lover
by
change
of
heart
in
one
lover
or
the
other
by
forced
confession
of
crafty
guardian
scheming
relative
or
jealous
rival
by
voluntary
confession
of
same
by
discovery
of
some
unguessed
secret
by
lover
storming
heart
by
lover
making
long
and
noble
and
so
on
endlessly
it
was
very
fetching
to
make
the
girl
propose
in
the
course
of
being
reunited
and
martin
discovered
bit
by
bit
other
decidedly
piquant
and
fetching
ruses
but
marriage
bells
at
the
end
was
the
one
thing
he
could
take
no
liberties
with
though
the
heavens
rolled
up
as
a
scroll
and
the
stars
fell
the
wedding
bells
must
go
on
ringing
just
the
same
in
quantity
the
formula
prescribed
twelve
hundred
words
minimum
dose
fifteen
hundred
words
maximum
dose
before
he
got
very
far
along
in
the
art
of
the
storiette
martin
worked
out
half
a
dozen
stock
forms
which
he
always
consulted
when
constructing
storiettes
these
forms
were
like
the
cunning
tables
used
by
mathematicians
which
may
be
entered
from
top
bottom
right
and
left
which
entrances
consist
of
scores
of
lines
and
dozens
of
columns
and
from
which
may
be
drawn
without
reasoning
or
thinking
thousands
of
different
conclusions
all
unchallengably
precise
and
true
thus
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
with
his
forms
martin
could
frame
up
a
dozen
or
so
storiettes
which
he
put
aside
and
filled
in
at
his
convenience
he
found
that
he
could
fill
one
in
after
a
day
of
serious
work
in
the
hour
before
going
to
bed
as
he
later
confessed
to
ruth
he
could
almost
do
it
in
his
sleep
the
real
work
was
in
constructing
the
frames
and
that
was
merely
mechanical
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
of
the
efficacy
of
his
formula
and
for
once
he
knew
the
editorial
mind
when
he
said
positively
to
himself
that
the
first
two
he
sent
off
would
bring
checks
and
checks
they
brought
for
four
dollars
each
at
the
end
of
twelve
days
in
the
meantime
he
was
making
fresh
and
alarming
discoveries
concerning
the
magazines
though
the
had
published
ring
of
bells
no
check
was
forthcoming
martin
needed
it
and
he
wrote
for
it
an
evasive
answer
and
a
request
for
more
of
his
work
was
all
he
received
he
had
gone
hungry
two
days
waiting
for
the
reply
and
it
was
then
that
he
put
his
wheel
back
in
pawn
he
wrote
regularly
twice
a
week
to
the
for
his
five
dollars
though
it
was
only
that
he
elicited
a
reply
he
did
not
know
that
the
had
been
staggering
along
precariously
for
years
that
it
was
a
or
without
standing
with
a
crazy
circulation
that
partly
rested
on
petty
bullying
and
partly
on
patriotic
appealing
and
with
advertisements
that
were
scarcely
more
than
charitable
donations
nor
did
he
know
that
the
was
the
sole
livelihood
of
the
editor
and
the
business
manager
and
that
they
could
wring
their
livelihood
out
of
it
only
by
moving
to
escape
paying
rent
and
by
never
paying
any
bill
they
could
evade
nor
could
he
have
guessed
that
the
particular
five
dollars
that
belonged
to
him
had
been
appropriated
by
the
business
manager
for
the
painting
of
his
house
in
alameda
which
painting
he
performed
himself
on
afternoons
because
he
could
not
afford
to
pay
union
wages
and
because
the
first
scab
he
had
employed
had
had
a
ladder
jerked
out
from
under
him
and
been
sent
to
the
hospital
with
a
broken
the
ten
dollars
for
which
martin
had
sold
to
the
chicago
newspaper
did
not
come
to
hand
the
article
had
been
published
as
he
had
ascertained
at
the
file
in
the
central
but
no
word
could
he
get
from
the
editor
his
letters
were
ignored
to
satisfy
himself
that
they
had
been
received
he
registered
several
of
them
it
was
nothing
less
than
robbery
he
steal
while
he
starved
he
was
pilfered
of
his
merchandise
of
his
goods
the
sale
of
which
was
the
sole
way
of
getting
bread
to
eat
and
was
a
weekly
and
it
had
published
of
his
serial
when
it
went
out
of
business
with
it
went
all
hopes
of
getting
his
sixteen
dollars
to
cap
the
situation
pot
which
he
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
best
things
he
had
written
was
lost
to
him
in
despair
casting
about
frantically
among
the
magazines
he
had
sent
it
to
a
society
weekly
in
san
francisco
his
chief
reason
for
submitting
it
to
that
publication
was
that
having
only
to
travel
across
the
bay
from
oakland
a
quick
decision
could
be
reached
two
weeks
later
he
was
overjoyed
to
see
in
the
latest
number
on
the
his
story
printed
in
full
illustrated
and
in
the
place
of
honor
he
went
home
with
leaping
pulse
wondering
how
much
they
would
pay
him
for
one
of
the
best
things
he
had
done
also
the
celerity
with
which
it
had
been
accepted
and
published
was
a
pleasant
thought
to
him
that
the
editor
had
not
informed
him
of
the
acceptance
made
the
surprise
more
complete
after
waiting
a
week
two
weeks
and
half
a
week
longer
desperation
conquered
diffidence
and
he
wrote
to
the
editor
of
suggesting
that
possibly
through
some
negligence
of
the
business
manager
his
little
account
had
been
overlooked
even
if
it
more
than
five
dollars
martin
thought
to
himself
it
will
buy
enough
beans
and
to
enable
me
to
write
half
a
dozen
like
it
and
possibly
as
good
back
came
a
cool
letter
from
the
editor
that
at
least
elicited
admiration
thank
you
it
ran
your
excellent
contribution
all
of
us
in
the
office
enjoyed
it
immensely
and
as
you
see
it
was
given
the
place
of
honor
and
immediate
publication
we
earnestly
hope
that
you
liked
the
illustrations
rereading
your
letter
it
seems
to
us
that
you
are
laboring
under
the
misapprehension
that
we
pay
for
unsolicited
manuscripts
this
is
not
our
custom
and
of
course
yours
was
unsolicited
we
assumed
naturally
when
we
received
your
story
that
you
understood
the
situation
we
can
only
deeply
regret
this
unfortunate
misunderstanding
and
assure
you
of
our
unfailing
regard
again
thanking
you
for
your
kind
contribution
and
hoping
to
receive
more
from
you
in
the
near
future
we
remain
there
was
also
a
postscript
to
the
effect
that
though
carried
no
it
took
great
pleasure
in
sending
him
a
complimentary
subscription
for
the
ensuing
year
after
that
experience
martin
typed
at
the
top
of
the
first
sheet
of
all
his
manuscripts
at
your
usual
some
day
he
consoled
himself
they
will
be
submitted
at
usual
rate
he
discovered
in
himself
at
this
period
a
passion
for
perfection
under
the
sway
of
which
he
rewrote
and
polished
jostling
street
wine
of
life
the
lyrics
and
others
of
his
earlier
work
as
of
old
nineteen
hours
of
labor
a
day
was
all
too
little
to
suit
him
he
wrote
prodigiously
and
he
read
prodigiously
forgetting
in
his
toil
the
pangs
caused
by
giving
up
his
tobacco
promised
cure
for
the
habit
flamboyantly
labelled
he
stowed
away
in
the
most
inaccessible
corner
of
his
bureau
especially
during
his
stretches
of
famine
he
suffered
from
lack
of
the
weed
but
no
matter
how
often
he
mastered
the
craving
it
remained
with
him
as
strong
as
ever
he
regarded
it
as
the
biggest
thing
he
had
ever
achieved
point
of
view
was
that
he
was
doing
no
more
than
was
right
she
brought
him
the
remedy
purchased
out
of
her
glove
money
and
in
a
few
days
forgot
all
about
it
his
storiettes
though
he
hated
them
and
derided
them
were
successful
by
means
of
them
he
redeemed
all
his
pledges
paid
most
of
his
bills
and
bought
a
new
set
of
tires
for
his
wheel
the
storiettes
at
least
kept
the
pot
and
gave
him
time
for
ambitious
work
while
the
one
thing
that
upheld
him
was
the
forty
dollars
he
had
received
from
white
he
anchored
his
faith
to
that
and
was
confident
that
the
really
magazines
would
pay
an
unknown
writer
at
least
an
equal
rate
if
not
a
better
one
but
the
thing
was
how
to
get
into
the
magazines
his
best
stories
essays
and
poems
went
begging
among
them
and
yet
each
month
he
read
reams
of
dull
prosy
inartistic
stuff
between
all
their
various
covers
if
only
one
editor
he
sometimes
thought
would
descend
from
his
high
seat
of
pride
to
write
me
one
cheering
line
no
matter
if
my
work
is
unusual
no
matter
if
it
is
unfit
for
prudential
reasons
for
their
pages
surely
there
must
be
some
sparks
in
it
somewhere
a
few
to
warm
them
to
some
sort
of
appreciation
and
thereupon
he
would
get
out
one
or
another
of
his
manuscripts
such
as
and
read
it
over
and
over
in
a
vain
attempt
to
vindicate
the
editorial
silence
as
the
sweet
california
spring
came
on
his
period
of
plenty
came
to
an
end
for
several
weeks
he
had
been
worried
by
a
strange
silence
on
the
part
of
the
newspaper
storiette
syndicate
then
one
day
came
back
to
him
through
the
mail
ten
of
his
immaculate
storiettes
they
were
accompanied
by
a
brief
letter
to
the
effect
that
the
syndicate
was
overstocked
and
that
some
months
would
elapse
before
it
would
be
in
the
market
again
for
manuscripts
martin
had
even
been
extravagant
on
the
strength
of
those
ten
storiettes
toward
the
last
the
syndicate
had
been
paying
him
five
dollars
each
for
them
and
accepting
every
one
he
sent
so
he
had
looked
upon
the
ten
as
good
as
sold
and
he
had
lived
accordingly
on
a
basis
of
fifty
dollars
in
the
bank
so
it
was
that
he
entered
abruptly
upon
a
lean
period
wherein
he
continued
selling
his
earlier
efforts
to
publications
that
would
not
pay
and
submitting
his
later
work
to
magazines
that
would
not
buy
also
he
resumed
his
trips
to
the
down
in
oakland
a
few
jokes
and
snatches
of
humorous
verse
sold
to
the
new
york
weeklies
made
existence
barely
possible
for
him
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
wrote
letters
of
inquiry
to
the
several
great
monthly
and
quarterly
reviews
and
learned
in
reply
that
they
rarely
considered
unsolicited
articles
and
that
most
of
their
contents
were
written
upon
order
by
specialists
who
were
authorities
in
their
various
fields
chapter
xxix
it
was
a
hard
summer
for
martin
manuscript
readers
and
editors
were
away
on
vacation
and
publications
that
ordinarily
returned
a
decision
in
three
weeks
now
retained
his
manuscript
for
three
months
or
more
the
consolation
he
drew
from
it
was
that
a
saving
in
postage
was
effected
by
the
deadlock
only
the
seemed
to
remain
actively
in
business
and
to
them
martin
disposed
of
all
his
early
efforts
such
as
sea
as
a
career
and
northeast
for
these
manuscripts
he
never
received
a
penny
it
is
true
after
six
correspondence
he
effected
a
compromise
whereby
he
received
a
safety
razor
for
and
that
having
agreed
to
give
him
five
dollars
cash
and
five
yearly
subscriptions
for
northeast
trades
fulfilled
the
second
part
of
the
agreement
for
a
sonnet
on
stevenson
he
managed
to
wring
two
dollars
out
of
a
boston
editor
who
was
running
a
magazine
with
a
matthew
arnold
taste
and
a
purse
peri
and
the
pearl
a
clever
skit
of
a
poem
of
two
hundred
lines
just
finished
white
hot
from
his
brain
won
the
heart
of
the
editor
of
a
san
francisco
magazine
published
in
the
interest
of
a
great
railroad
when
the
editor
wrote
offering
him
payment
in
transportation
martin
wrote
back
to
inquire
if
the
transportation
was
transferable
it
was
not
and
so
being
prevented
from
peddling
it
he
asked
for
the
return
of
the
poem
back
it
came
with
the
regrets
and
martin
sent
it
to
san
francisco
again
this
time
to
a
pretentious
monthly
that
had
been
fanned
into
a
constellation
of
the
first
magnitude
by
the
brilliant
journalist
who
founded
it
but
light
had
begun
to
dim
long
before
martin
was
born
the
editor
promised
martin
fifteen
dollars
for
the
poem
but
when
it
was
published
seemed
to
forget
about
it
several
of
his
letters
being
ignored
martin
indicted
an
angry
one
which
drew
a
reply
it
was
written
by
a
new
editor
who
coolly
informed
martin
that
he
declined
to
be
held
responsible
for
the
old
mistakes
and
that
he
did
not
think
much
of
peri
and
the
anyway
but
a
chicago
magazine
gave
martin
the
most
cruel
treatment
of
all
he
had
refrained
from
offering
his
for
publication
until
driven
to
it
by
starvation
after
having
been
rejected
by
a
dozen
magazines
they
had
come
to
rest
in
office
there
were
thirty
poems
in
the
collection
and
he
was
to
receive
a
dollar
apiece
for
them
the
first
month
four
were
published
and
he
promptly
received
a
check
for
four
dollars
but
when
he
looked
over
the
magazine
he
was
appalled
at
the
slaughter
in
some
cases
the
titles
had
been
altered
for
instance
being
changed
to
finish
and
song
of
the
outer
to
song
of
the
coral
in
one
case
an
absolutely
different
title
a
misappropriate
title
was
substituted
in
place
of
his
own
lights
the
editor
had
printed
backward
but
the
slaughter
in
the
body
of
the
poems
was
terrifying
martin
groaned
and
sweated
and
thrust
his
hands
through
his
hair
phrases
lines
and
stanzas
were
cut
out
interchanged
or
juggled
about
in
the
most
incomprehensible
manner
sometimes
lines
and
stanzas
not
his
own
were
substituted
for
his
he
could
not
believe
that
a
sane
editor
could
be
guilty
of
such
maltreatment
and
his
favorite
hypothesis
was
that
his
poems
must
have
been
doctored
by
the
office
boy
or
the
stenographer
martin
wrote
immediately
begging
the
editor
to
cease
publishing
the
lyrics
and
to
return
them
to
him
he
wrote
again
and
again
begging
entreating
threatening
but
his
letters
were
ignored
month
by
month
the
slaughter
went
on
till
the
thirty
poems
were
published
and
month
by
month
he
received
a
check
for
those
which
had
appeared
in
the
current
number
despite
these
various
misadventures
the
memory
of
the
check
sustained
him
though
he
was
driven
more
and
more
to
he
discovered
a
field
in
the
agricultural
weeklies
and
trade
journals
though
among
the
religious
weeklies
he
found
he
could
easily
starve
at
his
lowest
ebb
when
his
black
suit
was
in
pawn
he
made
a
so
it
seemed
to
a
prize
contest
arranged
by
the
county
committee
of
the
republican
party
there
were
three
branches
of
the
contest
and
he
entered
them
all
laughing
at
himself
bitterly
the
while
in
that
he
was
driven
to
such
straits
to
live
his
poem
won
the
first
prize
of
ten
dollars
his
campaign
song
the
second
prize
of
five
dollars
his
essay
on
the
principles
of
the
republican
party
the
first
prize
of
dollars
which
was
very
gratifying
to
him
until
he
tried
to
collect
something
had
gone
wrong
in
the
county
committee
and
though
a
rich
banker
and
a
state
senator
were
members
of
it
the
money
was
not
forthcoming
while
this
affair
was
hanging
fire
he
proved
that
he
understood
the
principles
of
the
democratic
party
by
winning
the
first
prize
for
his
essay
in
a
similar
contest
and
moreover
he
received
the
money
dollars
but
the
forty
dollars
won
in
the
first
contest
he
never
received
driven
to
shifts
in
order
to
see
ruth
and
deciding
that
the
long
walk
from
north
oakland
to
her
house
and
back
again
consumed
too
much
time
he
kept
his
black
suit
in
pawn
in
place
of
his
bicycle
the
latter
gave
him
exercise
saved
him
hours
of
time
for
work
and
enabled
him
to
see
ruth
just
the
same
a
pair
of
knee
duck
trousers
and
an
old
sweater
made
him
a
presentable
wheel
costume
so
that
he
could
go
with
ruth
on
afternoon
rides
besides
he
no
longer
had
opportunity
to
see
much
of
her
in
her
own
home
where
morse
was
thoroughly
prosecuting
her
campaign
of
entertainment
the
exalted
beings
he
met
there
and
to
whom
he
had
looked
up
but
a
short
time
before
now
bored
him
they
were
no
longer
exalted
he
was
nervous
and
irritable
what
of
his
hard
times
disappointments
and
close
application
to
work
and
the
conversation
of
such
people
was
maddening
he
was
not
unduly
egotistic
he
measured
the
narrowness
of
their
minds
by
the
minds
of
the
thinkers
in
the
books
he
read
at
home
he
never
met
a
large
mind
with
the
exception
of
professor
caldwell
and
caldwell
he
had
met
there
only
once
as
for
the
rest
they
were
numskulls
ninnies
superficial
dogmatic
and
ignorant
it
was
their
ignorance
that
astounded
him
what
was
the
matter
with
them
what
had
they
done
with
their
educations
they
had
had
access
to
the
same
books
he
had
how
did
it
happen
that
they
had
drawn
nothing
from
them
he
knew
that
the
great
minds
the
deep
and
rational
thinkers
existed
he
had
his
proofs
from
the
books
the
books
that
had
educated
him
beyond
the
morse
standard
and
he
knew
that
higher
intellects
than
those
of
the
morse
circle
were
to
be
found
in
the
world
he
read
english
society
novels
wherein
he
caught
glimpses
of
men
and
women
talking
politics
and
philosophy
and
he
read
of
salons
in
great
cities
even
in
the
united
states
where
art
and
intellect
congregated
foolishly
in
the
past
he
had
conceived
that
all
persons
above
the
working
class
were
persons
with
power
of
intellect
and
vigor
of
beauty
culture
and
collars
had
gone
together
to
him
and
he
had
been
deceived
into
believing
that
college
educations
and
mastery
were
the
same
things
well
he
would
fight
his
way
on
and
up
higher
and
he
would
take
ruth
with
him
her
he
dearly
loved
and
he
was
confident
that
she
would
shine
anywhere
as
it
was
clear
to
him
that
he
had
been
handicapped
by
his
early
environment
so
now
he
perceived
that
she
was
similarly
handicapped
she
had
not
had
a
chance
to
expand
the
books
on
her
shelves
the
paintings
on
the
walls
the
music
on
the
was
just
so
much
meretricious
display
to
real
literature
real
painting
real
music
the
morses
and
their
kind
were
dead
and
bigger
than
such
things
was
life
of
which
they
were
densely
hopelessly
ignorant
in
spite
of
their
unitarian
proclivities
and
their
masks
of
conservative
broadmindedness
they
were
two
generations
behind
interpretative
science
their
mental
processes
were
mediaeval
while
their
thinking
on
the
ultimate
data
of
existence
and
of
the
universe
struck
him
as
the
same
metaphysical
method
that
was
as
young
as
the
youngest
race
as
old
as
the
and
same
that
moved
the
first
pleistocene
to
fear
the
dark
that
moved
the
first
hasty
hebrew
savage
to
incarnate
eve
from
rib
that
moved
descartes
to
build
an
idealistic
system
of
the
universe
out
of
the
projections
of
his
own
puny
ego
and
that
moved
the
famous
british
ecclesiastic
to
denounce
evolution
in
satire
so
scathing
as
to
win
immediate
applause
and
leave
his
name
a
notorious
scrawl
on
the
page
of
history
so
martin
thought
and
he
thought
further
till
it
dawned
upon
him
that
the
difference
between
these
lawyers
officers
business
men
and
bank
cashiers
he
had
met
and
the
members
of
the
working
class
he
had
known
was
on
a
par
with
the
difference
in
the
food
they
ate
clothes
they
wore
neighborhoods
in
which
they
lived
certainly
in
all
of
them
was
lacking
the
something
more
which
he
found
in
himself
and
in
the
books
the
morses
had
shown
him
the
best
their
social
position
could
produce
and
he
was
not
impressed
by
it
a
pauper
himself
a
slave
to
the
he
knew
himself
the
superior
of
those
he
met
at
the
and
when
his
one
decent
suit
of
clothes
was
out
of
pawn
he
moved
among
them
a
lord
of
life
quivering
with
a
sense
of
outrage
akin
to
what
a
prince
would
suffer
if
condemned
to
live
with
hate
and
fear
the
socialists
he
remarked
to
morse
one
evening
at
dinner
why
you
know
neither
them
nor
their
the
conversation
had
been
swung
in
that
direction
by
morse
who
had
been
invidiously
singing
the
praises
of
hapgood
the
cashier
was
black
beast
and
his
temper
was
a
trifle
short
where
the
talker
of
platitudes
was
concerned
he
had
said
hapgood
is
what
they
call
a
rising
young
told
me
as
much
and
it
is
true
make
the
chair
before
he
dies
and
who
knows
maybe
the
united
states
makes
you
think
so
morse
had
inquired
heard
him
make
a
campaign
speech
it
was
so
cleverly
stupid
and
unoriginal
and
also
so
convincing
that
the
leaders
can
not
help
but
regard
him
as
safe
and
sure
while
his
platitudes
are
so
much
like
the
platitudes
of
the
average
voter
well
you
know
you
flatter
any
man
by
dressing
up
his
own
thoughts
for
him
and
presenting
them
to
actually
think
you
are
jealous
of
hapgood
ruth
had
chimed
in
forbid
the
look
of
horror
on
face
stirred
morse
to
belligerence
surely
mean
to
say
that
hapgood
is
stupid
she
demanded
icily
more
than
the
average
republican
was
the
retort
average
democrat
either
they
are
all
stupid
when
they
are
not
crafty
and
very
few
of
them
are
crafty
the
only
wise
republicans
are
the
millionnaires
and
their
conscious
henchmen
they
know
which
side
their
bread
is
buttered
on
and
they
know
am
a
republican
morse
put
in
lightly
how
do
you
classify
me
you
are
an
unconscious
yes
you
do
corporation
work
you
have
no
nor
criminal
practice
you
depend
upon
and
pickpockets
for
your
income
you
get
your
livelihood
from
the
masters
of
society
and
whoever
feeds
a
man
is
that
master
yes
you
are
a
henchman
you
are
interested
in
advancing
the
interests
of
the
aggregations
of
capital
you
face
was
a
trifle
red
confess
sir
he
said
you
talk
like
a
scoundrelly
then
it
was
that
martin
made
his
remark
hate
and
fear
the
socialists
but
why
you
know
neither
them
nor
their
doctrine
certainly
sounds
like
socialism
morse
replied
while
ruth
gazed
anxiously
from
one
to
the
other
and
morse
beamed
happily
at
the
opportunity
afforded
of
rousing
her
liege
antagonism
i
say
republicans
are
stupid
and
hold
that
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
are
exploded
bubbles
does
not
make
me
a
socialist
martin
said
with
a
smile
i
question
jefferson
and
the
unscientific
frenchmen
who
informed
his
mind
does
not
make
me
a
socialist
believe
me
morse
you
are
far
nearer
socialism
than
i
who
am
its
avowed
you
please
to
be
facetious
was
all
the
other
could
say
at
all
i
speak
in
all
seriousness
you
still
believe
in
equality
and
yet
you
do
the
work
of
the
corporations
and
the
corporations
from
day
to
day
are
busily
engaged
in
burying
equality
and
you
call
me
a
socialist
because
i
deny
equality
because
i
affirm
just
what
you
live
up
to
the
republicans
are
foes
to
equality
though
most
of
them
fight
the
battle
against
equality
with
the
very
word
itself
the
slogan
on
their
lips
in
the
name
of
equality
they
destroy
equality
that
was
why
i
called
them
stupid
as
for
myself
i
am
an
individualist
i
believe
the
race
is
to
the
swift
the
battle
to
the
strong
such
is
the
lesson
i
have
learned
from
biology
or
at
least
think
i
have
learned
as
i
said
i
am
an
individualist
and
individualism
is
the
hereditary
and
eternal
foe
of
you
frequent
socialist
meetings
morse
challenged
just
as
spies
frequent
hostile
camps
how
else
are
you
to
learn
about
the
enemy
besides
i
enjoy
myself
at
their
meetings
they
are
good
fighters
and
right
or
wrong
they
have
read
the
books
any
one
of
them
knows
far
more
about
sociology
and
all
the
other
ologies
than
the
average
captain
of
industry
yes
i
have
been
to
half
a
dozen
of
their
meetings
but
that
make
me
a
socialist
any
more
than
hearing
charley
hapgood
orate
made
me
a
help
it
morse
said
feebly
i
still
believe
you
incline
that
bless
me
martin
thought
to
himself
he
know
what
i
was
talking
about
he
understood
a
word
of
it
what
did
he
do
with
his
education
anyway
thus
in
his
development
martin
found
himself
face
to
face
with
economic
morality
or
the
morality
of
class
and
soon
it
became
to
him
a
grisly
monster
personally
he
was
an
intellectual
moralist
and
more
offending
to
him
than
platitudinous
pomposity
was
the
morality
of
those
about
him
which
was
a
curious
hotchpotch
of
the
economic
the
metaphysical
the
sentimental
and
the
imitative
a
sample
of
this
curious
messy
mixture
he
encountered
nearer
home
his
sister
marian
had
been
keeping
company
with
an
industrious
young
mechanic
of
german
extraction
who
after
thoroughly
learning
the
trade
had
set
up
for
himself
in
a
shop
also
having
got
the
agency
for
a
make
of
wheel
he
was
prosperous
marian
had
called
on
martin
in
his
room
a
short
time
before
to
announce
her
engagement
during
which
visit
she
had
playfully
inspected
palm
and
told
his
fortune
on
her
next
visit
she
brought
hermann
von
schmidt
along
with
her
martin
did
the
honors
and
congratulated
both
of
them
in
language
so
easy
and
graceful
as
to
affect
disagreeably
the
of
his
lover
this
bad
impression
was
further
heightened
by
reading
aloud
the
stanzas
of
verse
with
which
he
had
commemorated
previous
visit
it
was
a
bit
of
society
verse
airy
and
delicate
which
he
had
named
he
was
surprised
when
he
finished
reading
it
to
note
no
enjoyment
in
his
face
instead
her
eyes
were
fixed
anxiously
upon
her
betrothed
and
martin
following
her
gaze
saw
spread
on
that
asymmetrical
features
nothing
but
black
and
sullen
disapproval
the
incident
passed
over
they
made
an
early
departure
and
martin
forgot
all
about
it
though
for
the
moment
he
had
been
puzzled
that
any
woman
even
of
the
working
class
should
not
have
been
flattered
and
delighted
by
having
poetry
written
about
her
several
evenings
later
marian
again
visited
him
this
time
alone
nor
did
she
waste
time
in
coming
to
the
point
upbraiding
him
sorrowfully
for
what
he
had
done
marian
he
chided
talk
as
though
you
were
ashamed
of
your
relatives
or
of
your
brother
at
any
i
am
too
she
blurted
out
martin
was
bewildered
by
the
tears
of
mortification
he
saw
in
her
eyes
the
mood
whatever
it
was
was
genuine
marian
why
should
your
hermann
be
jealous
of
my
writing
poetry
about
my
own
sister
jealous
she
sobbed
says
it
was
indecent
martin
emitted
a
long
low
whistle
of
incredulity
then
proceeded
to
resurrect
and
read
a
carbon
copy
of
see
it
he
said
finally
proffering
the
manuscript
to
her
it
yourself
and
show
me
whatever
strikes
you
as
was
the
word
it
says
so
and
he
ought
to
know
was
the
answer
with
a
wave
aside
of
the
manuscript
accompanied
by
a
look
of
loathing
he
says
got
to
tear
it
up
he
says
he
have
no
wife
of
his
with
such
things
written
about
her
which
anybody
can
read
he
says
a
disgrace
he
stand
for
look
here
marian
this
is
nothing
but
nonsense
martin
began
then
abruptly
changed
his
mind
he
saw
before
him
an
unhappy
girl
knew
the
futility
of
attempting
to
convince
her
husband
or
her
and
though
the
whole
situation
was
absurd
and
preposterous
he
resolved
to
surrender
right
he
announced
tearing
the
manuscript
into
half
a
dozen
pieces
and
throwing
it
into
the
he
contented
himself
with
the
knowledge
that
even
then
the
original
manuscript
was
reposing
in
the
office
of
a
new
york
magazine
marian
and
her
husband
would
never
know
and
neither
himself
nor
they
nor
the
world
would
lose
if
the
pretty
harmless
poem
ever
were
published
marian
starting
to
reach
into
the
refrained
i
she
pleaded
he
nodded
his
head
regarding
her
thoughtfully
as
she
gathered
the
torn
pieces
of
manuscript
and
tucked
them
into
the
pocket
of
her
evidence
of
the
success
of
her
mission
she
reminded
him
of
lizzie
connolly
though
there
was
less
of
fire
and
gorgeous
flaunting
life
in
her
than
in
that
other
girl
of
the
working
class
whom
he
had
seen
twice
but
they
were
on
a
par
the
pair
of
them
in
dress
and
carriage
and
he
smiled
with
inward
amusement
at
the
caprice
of
his
fancy
which
suggested
the
appearance
of
either
of
them
in
the
amusement
faded
and
he
was
aware
of
a
great
loneliness
this
sister
of
his
and
the
morse
were
milestones
of
the
road
he
had
travelled
and
he
had
left
them
behind
he
glanced
affectionately
about
him
at
his
few
books
they
were
all
the
comrades
left
to
him
that
he
demanded
in
startled
surprise
marian
repeated
her
question
i
go
to
work
he
broke
into
a
laugh
that
was
only
hermann
of
yours
has
been
talking
to
she
shook
her
head
lie
he
commanded
and
the
nod
of
her
head
affirmed
his
charge
you
tell
that
hermann
of
yours
to
mind
his
own
business
that
when
i
write
poetry
about
the
girl
keeping
company
with
his
business
but
that
outside
of
that
got
no
say
so
understand
you
think
succeed
as
a
writer
eh
he
went
on
think
no
good
fallen
down
and
am
a
disgrace
to
the
family
think
it
would
be
much
better
if
you
got
a
job
she
said
firmly
and
he
saw
she
was
sincere
hermann
he
broke
out
i
want
to
know
is
when
going
to
get
married
also
you
find
out
from
your
hermann
if
he
will
deign
to
permit
you
to
accept
a
wedding
present
from
he
mused
over
the
incident
after
she
had
gone
and
once
or
twice
broke
out
into
laughter
that
was
bitter
as
he
saw
his
sister
and
her
betrothed
all
the
members
of
his
own
class
and
the
members
of
class
directing
their
narrow
little
lives
by
narrow
little
flocking
together
and
patterning
their
lives
by
one
opinions
failing
of
being
individuals
and
of
really
living
life
because
of
the
childlike
formulas
by
which
they
were
enslaved
he
summoned
them
before
him
in
apparitional
procession
bernard
higginbotham
arm
in
arm
with
butler
hermann
von
schmidt
cheek
by
jowl
with
charley
hapgood
and
one
by
one
and
in
pairs
he
judged
them
and
dismissed
them
by
the
standards
of
intellect
and
morality
he
had
learned
from
the
books
vainly
he
asked
where
are
the
great
souls
the
great
men
and
women
he
found
them
not
among
the
careless
gross
and
stupid
intelligences
that
answered
the
call
of
vision
to
his
narrow
room
he
felt
a
loathing
for
them
such
as
circe
must
have
felt
for
her
swine
when
he
had
dismissed
the
last
one
and
thought
himself
alone
a
entered
unexpected
and
unsummoned
martin
watched
him
and
saw
the
the
coat
and
the
swaggering
shoulders
of
the
youthful
hoodlum
who
had
once
been
he
were
like
all
the
rest
young
fellow
martin
sneered
morality
and
your
knowledge
were
just
the
same
as
theirs
you
did
not
think
and
act
for
yourself
your
opinions
like
your
clothes
were
ready
made
your
acts
were
shaped
by
popular
approval
you
were
cock
of
your
gang
because
others
acclaimed
you
the
real
thing
you
fought
and
ruled
the
gang
not
because
you
liked
to
know
you
really
despised
it
because
the
other
fellows
patted
you
on
the
shoulder
you
licked
because
you
give
in
and
you
give
in
partly
because
you
were
an
abysmal
brute
and
for
the
rest
because
you
believed
what
every
one
about
you
believed
that
the
measure
of
manhood
was
the
carnivorous
ferocity
displayed
in
injuring
and
marring
anatomies
why
you
whelp
you
even
won
other
girls
away
from
them
not
because
you
wanted
the
girls
but
because
in
the
marrow
of
those
about
you
those
who
set
your
moral
pace
was
the
instinct
of
the
wild
stallion
and
the
well
the
years
have
passed
and
what
do
you
think
about
it
now
as
if
in
reply
the
vision
underwent
a
swift
metamorphosis
the
and
the
vanished
being
replaced
by
milder
garments
the
toughness
went
out
of
the
face
the
hardness
out
of
the
eyes
and
the
face
chastened
and
refined
was
irradiated
from
an
inner
life
of
communion
with
beauty
and
knowledge
the
apparition
was
very
like
his
present
self
and
as
he
regarded
it
he
noted
the
by
which
it
was
illuminated
and
the
book
over
which
it
pored
he
glanced
at
the
title
and
read
science
of
next
he
entered
into
the
apparition
trimmed
the
and
himself
went
on
reading
science
of
chapter
xxx
on
a
beautiful
fall
day
a
day
of
similar
indian
summer
to
that
which
had
seen
their
love
declared
the
year
before
martin
read
his
to
ruth
it
was
in
the
afternoon
and
as
before
they
had
ridden
out
to
their
favorite
knoll
in
the
hills
now
and
again
she
had
interrupted
his
reading
with
exclamations
of
pleasure
and
now
as
he
laid
the
last
sheet
of
manuscript
with
its
fellows
he
waited
her
judgment
she
delayed
to
speak
and
at
last
she
spoke
haltingly
hesitating
to
frame
in
words
the
harshness
of
her
thought
think
they
are
beautiful
very
beautiful
she
said
you
sell
them
can
you
you
see
what
i
mean
she
said
almost
pleaded
writing
of
yours
is
not
practical
something
is
the
it
is
with
the
prevents
you
from
earning
a
living
by
it
and
please
dear
misunderstand
me
i
am
flattered
and
made
proud
and
all
could
not
be
a
true
woman
were
it
you
should
write
these
poems
to
me
but
they
do
not
make
our
marriage
possible
you
see
martin
think
me
mercenary
it
is
love
the
thought
of
our
future
with
which
i
am
burdened
a
whole
year
has
gone
by
since
we
learned
we
loved
each
other
and
our
wedding
day
is
no
nearer
think
me
immodest
in
thus
talking
about
our
wedding
for
really
i
have
my
heart
all
that
i
am
at
stake
why
you
try
to
get
work
on
a
newspaper
if
you
are
so
bound
up
in
your
writing
why
not
become
a
reporter
a
while
at
least
would
spoil
my
style
was
his
answer
in
a
low
monotonous
voice
have
no
idea
how
worked
for
those
storiettes
she
argued
called
them
you
wrote
many
of
them
they
spoil
your
style
the
cases
are
different
the
storiettes
were
ground
out
jaded
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
of
application
to
style
but
a
work
is
all
hack
from
morning
till
night
is
the
one
paramount
thing
of
life
and
it
is
a
whirlwind
life
the
life
of
the
moment
with
neither
past
nor
future
and
certainly
without
thought
of
any
style
but
reportorial
style
and
that
certainly
is
not
literature
to
become
a
reporter
now
just
as
my
style
is
taking
form
crystallizing
would
be
to
commit
literary
suicide
as
it
is
every
storiette
every
word
of
every
storiette
was
a
violation
of
myself
of
my
of
my
respect
for
beauty
i
tell
you
it
was
sickening
i
was
guilty
of
sin
and
i
was
secretly
glad
when
the
markets
failed
even
if
my
clothes
did
go
into
pawn
but
the
joy
of
writing
the
the
creative
joy
in
its
noblest
form
that
was
compensation
for
martin
did
not
know
that
ruth
was
unsympathetic
concerning
the
creative
joy
she
used
the
was
on
her
lips
he
had
first
heard
it
she
had
read
about
it
studied
about
it
in
the
university
in
the
course
of
earning
her
bachelorship
of
arts
but
she
was
not
original
not
creative
and
all
manifestations
of
culture
on
her
part
were
but
harpings
of
the
harpings
of
others
not
the
editor
have
been
right
in
his
revision
of
your
she
questioned
an
editor
must
have
proved
qualifications
or
else
he
would
not
be
an
in
line
with
the
persistence
of
the
established
he
rejoined
his
heat
against
the
getting
the
better
of
him
is
is
not
only
right
but
is
the
best
possible
the
existence
of
anything
is
sufficient
vindication
of
its
fitness
to
exist
mark
you
as
the
average
person
unconsciously
believes
not
merely
in
present
conditions
but
in
all
conditions
it
is
their
ignorance
of
course
that
makes
them
believe
such
ignorance
which
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
henidical
mental
process
described
by
weininger
they
think
they
think
and
such
thinkless
creatures
are
the
arbiters
of
the
lives
of
the
few
who
really
he
paused
overcome
by
the
consciousness
that
he
had
been
talking
over
head
sure
i
know
who
this
weininger
is
she
retorted
you
are
so
dreadfully
general
that
i
fail
to
follow
you
what
i
was
speaking
of
was
the
qualification
of
tell
you
he
interrupted
chief
qualification
of
per
cent
of
all
editors
is
failure
they
have
failed
as
writers
think
they
prefer
the
drudgery
of
the
desk
and
the
slavery
to
their
circulation
and
to
the
business
manager
to
the
joy
of
writing
they
have
tried
to
write
and
they
have
failed
and
right
there
is
the
cursed
paradox
of
it
every
portal
to
success
in
literature
is
guarded
by
those
the
failures
in
literature
the
editors
associate
editors
most
of
them
and
the
for
the
magazines
and
most
of
them
nearly
all
of
them
are
men
who
wanted
to
write
and
who
have
failed
and
yet
they
of
all
creatures
under
the
sun
the
most
unfit
are
the
very
creatures
who
decide
what
shall
and
what
shall
not
find
its
way
into
who
have
proved
themselves
not
original
who
have
demonstrated
that
they
lack
the
divine
fire
sit
in
judgment
upon
originality
and
genius
and
after
them
come
the
reviewers
just
so
many
more
failures
tell
me
that
they
have
not
dreamed
the
dream
and
attempted
to
write
poetry
or
fiction
for
they
have
and
they
have
failed
why
the
average
review
is
more
nauseating
than
oil
but
you
know
my
opinion
on
the
reviewers
and
the
alleged
critics
there
are
great
critics
but
they
are
as
rare
as
comets
if
i
fail
as
a
writer
i
shall
have
proved
for
the
career
of
editorship
bread
and
butter
and
jam
at
any
mind
was
quick
and
her
disapproval
of
her
views
was
buttressed
by
the
contradiction
she
found
in
his
contention
martin
if
that
be
so
if
all
the
doors
are
closed
as
you
have
shown
so
conclusively
how
is
it
possible
that
any
of
the
great
writers
ever
arrived
arrived
by
achieving
the
impossible
he
answered
did
such
blazing
glorious
work
as
to
burn
to
ashes
those
that
opposed
them
they
arrived
by
course
of
miracle
by
winning
a
wager
against
them
they
arrived
because
they
were
giants
who
will
not
be
kept
down
and
that
is
what
i
must
do
i
must
achieve
the
if
you
fail
you
must
consider
me
as
well
i
fail
he
regarded
her
for
a
moment
as
though
the
thought
she
had
uttered
was
unthinkable
then
intelligence
illumined
his
eyes
i
fail
i
shall
become
an
editor
and
you
will
be
an
she
frowned
at
his
pretty
adorable
frown
that
made
him
put
his
arm
around
her
and
kiss
it
away
enough
she
urged
by
an
effort
of
will
withdrawing
herself
from
the
fascination
of
his
strength
have
talked
with
father
and
mother
i
never
before
asserted
myself
so
against
them
i
demanded
to
be
heard
i
was
very
undutiful
they
are
against
you
you
know
but
i
assured
them
over
and
over
of
my
abiding
love
for
you
and
at
last
father
agreed
that
if
you
wanted
to
you
could
begin
right
away
in
his
office
and
then
of
his
own
accord
he
said
he
would
pay
you
enough
at
the
start
so
that
we
could
get
married
and
have
a
little
cottage
somewhere
which
i
think
was
very
fine
of
you
martin
with
the
dull
pain
of
despair
at
his
heart
mechanically
reaching
for
the
tobacco
and
paper
which
he
no
longer
carried
to
roll
a
cigarette
muttered
something
inarticulate
and
ruth
went
on
though
and
let
it
hurt
tell
you
to
show
you
precisely
how
you
stand
with
like
your
radical
views
and
he
thinks
you
are
lazy
of
course
i
know
you
are
not
i
know
you
work
how
hard
even
she
did
not
know
was
the
thought
in
mind
then
he
said
about
my
views
do
you
think
they
are
so
radical
he
held
her
eyes
and
waited
the
answer
think
them
well
very
disconcerting
she
replied
the
question
was
answered
for
him
and
so
oppressed
was
he
by
the
grayness
of
life
that
he
forgot
the
tentative
proposition
she
had
made
for
him
to
go
to
work
and
she
having
gone
as
far
as
she
dared
was
willing
to
wait
the
answer
till
she
should
bring
the
question
up
again
she
had
not
long
to
wait
martin
had
a
question
of
his
own
to
propound
to
her
he
wanted
to
ascertain
the
measure
of
her
faith
in
him
and
within
the
week
each
was
answered
martin
precipitated
it
by
reading
to
her
his
shame
of
the
you
become
a
reporter
she
asked
when
he
had
finished
love
writing
so
and
i
am
sure
you
would
succeed
you
could
rise
in
journalism
and
make
a
name
for
yourself
there
are
a
number
of
great
special
correspondents
their
salaries
are
large
and
their
field
is
the
world
they
are
sent
everywhere
to
the
heart
of
africa
like
stanley
or
to
interview
the
pope
or
to
explore
unknown
you
like
my
essay
he
rejoined
believe
that
i
have
some
show
in
journalism
but
none
in
literature
no
i
do
like
it
it
reads
well
but
i
am
afraid
over
the
heads
of
your
readers
at
least
it
is
over
mine
it
sounds
beautiful
but
i
understand
it
your
scientific
slang
is
beyond
me
you
are
an
extremist
you
know
dear
and
what
may
be
intelligible
to
you
may
not
be
intelligible
to
the
rest
of
imagine
the
philosophic
slang
that
bothers
you
was
all
he
could
say
he
was
flaming
from
the
fresh
reading
of
the
ripest
thought
he
had
expressed
and
her
verdict
stunned
him
matter
how
poorly
it
is
done
he
persisted
you
see
anything
in
it
the
thought
of
it
i
mean
she
shook
her
head
it
is
so
different
from
anything
i
have
read
i
read
maeterlinck
and
understand
mysticism
you
understand
that
martin
flashed
out
but
this
of
yours
which
is
supposed
to
be
an
attack
upon
him
i
understand
of
course
if
originality
he
stopped
her
with
an
impatient
gesture
that
was
not
followed
by
speech
he
became
suddenly
aware
that
she
was
speaking
and
that
she
had
been
speaking
for
some
time
all
your
writing
has
been
a
toy
to
you
she
was
saying
you
have
played
with
it
long
enough
it
is
time
to
take
up
life
life
martin
hitherto
you
have
lived
solely
your
want
me
to
go
to
work
he
asked
father
has
understand
all
that
he
broke
in
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
or
not
you
have
lost
faith
in
me
she
pressed
his
hand
mutely
her
eyes
dim
your
writing
dear
she
admitted
in
a
read
lots
of
my
stuff
he
went
on
brutally
do
you
think
of
it
is
it
utterly
hopeless
how
does
it
compare
with
other
work
they
sell
theirs
and
answer
my
question
do
you
think
that
literature
is
not
at
all
my
vocation
i
will
she
steeled
herself
to
do
it
think
you
were
made
to
write
forgive
me
dear
you
compel
me
to
say
it
and
you
know
i
know
more
about
literature
than
you
you
are
a
bachelor
of
arts
he
said
meditatively
you
ought
to
there
is
more
to
be
said
he
continued
after
a
pause
painful
to
both
know
what
i
have
in
me
no
one
knows
that
so
well
as
i
know
i
shall
succeed
i
will
not
be
kept
down
i
am
afire
with
what
i
have
to
say
in
verse
and
fiction
and
essay
i
do
not
ask
you
to
have
faith
in
that
though
i
do
not
ask
you
to
have
faith
in
me
nor
in
my
writing
what
i
do
ask
of
you
is
to
love
me
and
have
faith
in
love
year
ago
i
begged
for
two
years
one
of
those
years
is
yet
to
run
and
i
do
believe
upon
my
honor
and
my
soul
that
before
that
year
is
run
i
shall
have
succeeded
you
remember
what
you
told
me
long
ago
that
i
must
serve
my
apprenticeship
to
writing
well
i
have
served
it
i
have
crammed
it
and
telescoped
it
with
you
at
the
end
awaiting
me
i
have
never
shirked
do
you
know
i
have
forgotten
what
it
is
to
fall
peacefully
asleep
a
few
million
years
ago
i
knew
what
it
was
to
sleep
my
fill
and
to
awake
naturally
from
very
glut
of
sleep
i
am
awakened
always
now
by
an
alarm
clock
if
i
fall
asleep
early
or
late
i
set
the
alarm
accordingly
and
this
and
the
putting
out
of
the
lamp
are
my
last
conscious
actions
i
begin
to
feel
drowsy
i
change
the
heavy
book
i
am
reading
for
a
lighter
one
and
when
i
doze
over
that
i
beat
my
head
with
my
knuckles
in
order
to
drive
sleep
away
somewhere
i
read
of
a
man
who
was
afraid
to
sleep
kipling
wrote
the
story
this
man
arranged
a
spur
so
that
when
unconsciousness
came
his
naked
body
pressed
against
the
iron
teeth
well
done
the
same
i
look
at
the
time
and
i
resolve
that
not
until
midnight
or
not
until
one
or
two
or
three
shall
the
spur
be
removed
and
so
it
rowels
me
awake
until
the
appointed
time
that
spur
has
been
my
for
months
i
have
grown
so
desperate
that
five
and
a
half
hours
of
sleep
is
an
extravagance
i
sleep
four
hours
now
i
am
starved
for
sleep
there
are
times
when
i
am
from
want
of
sleep
times
when
death
with
its
rest
and
sleep
is
a
positive
lure
to
me
times
when
i
am
haunted
by
lines
sea
is
still
and
deep
all
things
within
its
bosom
sleep
a
single
step
and
all
is
a
plunge
a
bubble
and
no
course
this
is
sheer
nonsense
it
comes
from
nervousness
from
an
overwrought
mind
but
the
point
is
why
have
i
done
this
for
you
to
shorten
my
apprenticeship
to
compel
success
to
hasten
and
my
apprenticeship
is
now
served
i
know
my
equipment
i
swear
that
i
learn
more
each
month
than
the
average
college
man
learns
in
a
year
i
know
it
i
tell
you
but
were
my
need
for
you
to
understand
not
so
desperate
i
should
not
tell
you
it
is
not
boasting
i
measure
the
results
by
the
books
your
brothers
are
ignorant
barbarians
compared
with
me
and
the
knowledge
i
have
wrung
from
the
books
in
the
hours
they
were
sleeping
long
ago
i
wanted
to
be
famous
i
care
very
little
for
fame
now
what
i
want
is
you
i
am
more
hungry
for
you
than
for
food
or
clothing
or
recognition
i
have
a
dream
of
laying
my
head
on
your
breast
and
sleeping
an
aeon
or
so
and
the
dream
will
come
true
ere
another
year
is
his
power
beat
against
her
wave
upon
wave
and
in
the
moment
his
will
opposed
hers
most
she
felt
herself
most
strongly
drawn
toward
him
the
strength
that
had
always
poured
out
from
him
to
her
was
now
flowering
in
his
impassioned
voice
his
flashing
eyes
and
the
vigor
of
life
and
intellect
surging
in
him
and
in
that
moment
and
for
the
moment
she
was
aware
of
a
rift
that
showed
in
her
rift
through
which
she
caught
sight
of
the
real
martin
eden
splendid
and
invincible
and
as
have
their
moments
of
doubt
so
she
for
the
instant
seemed
to
doubt
her
power
to
tame
this
wild
spirit
of
a
man
another
thing
he
swept
on
love
me
but
why
do
you
love
me
the
thing
in
me
that
compels
me
to
write
is
the
very
thing
that
draws
your
love
you
love
me
because
i
am
somehow
different
from
the
men
you
have
known
and
might
have
loved
i
was
not
made
for
the
desk
and
for
petty
business
squabbling
and
legal
jangling
make
me
do
such
things
make
me
like
those
other
men
doing
the
work
they
do
breathing
the
air
they
breathe
developing
the
point
of
view
they
have
developed
and
you
have
destroyed
the
difference
destroyed
me
destroyed
the
thing
you
love
my
desire
to
write
is
the
most
vital
thing
in
me
had
i
been
a
mere
clod
neither
would
i
have
desired
to
write
nor
would
you
have
desired
me
for
a
you
forget
she
interrupted
the
quick
surface
of
her
mind
glimpsing
a
parallel
have
been
eccentric
inventors
starving
their
families
while
they
sought
such
chimeras
as
perpetual
motion
doubtless
their
wives
loved
them
and
suffered
with
them
and
for
them
not
because
of
but
in
spite
of
their
infatuation
for
perpetual
was
the
reply
there
have
been
inventors
who
were
not
eccentric
and
who
starved
while
they
sought
to
invent
practical
things
and
sometimes
it
is
recorded
they
succeeded
certainly
i
do
not
seek
any
have
called
it
the
impossible
she
interpolated
spoke
figuratively
i
seek
to
do
what
men
have
done
before
write
and
to
live
by
my
her
silence
spurred
him
on
you
then
my
goal
is
as
much
a
chimera
as
perpetual
motion
he
demanded
he
read
her
answer
in
the
pressure
of
her
hand
on
pitying
for
the
hurt
child
and
to
her
just
then
he
was
the
hurt
child
the
infatuated
man
striving
to
achieve
the
impossible
toward
the
close
of
their
talk
she
warned
him
again
of
the
antagonism
of
her
father
and
mother
you
love
me
he
asked
do
i
do
she
cried
i
love
you
not
them
and
nothing
they
do
can
hurt
triumph
sounded
in
his
voice
i
have
faith
in
your
love
not
fear
of
their
enmity
all
things
may
go
astray
in
this
world
but
not
love
love
can
not
go
wrong
unless
it
be
a
weakling
that
faints
and
stumbles
by
the
chapter
xxxi
martin
had
encountered
his
sister
gertrude
by
chance
on
it
proved
a
most
propitious
yet
disconcerting
chance
waiting
on
the
corner
for
a
car
she
had
seen
him
first
and
noted
the
eager
hungry
lines
of
his
face
and
the
desperate
worried
look
of
his
eyes
in
truth
he
was
desperate
and
worried
he
had
just
come
from
a
fruitless
interview
with
the
pawnbroker
from
whom
he
had
tried
to
wring
an
additional
loan
on
his
wheel
the
muddy
fall
weather
having
come
on
martin
had
pledged
his
wheel
some
time
since
and
retained
his
black
suit
the
black
suit
the
pawnbroker
who
knew
his
every
asset
had
answered
tell
me
gone
and
pledged
it
with
that
jew
lipka
because
if
you
the
man
had
looked
the
threat
and
martin
hastened
to
cry
no
got
it
but
i
want
to
wear
it
on
a
matter
of
right
the
mollified
usurer
had
replied
i
want
it
on
a
matter
of
business
before
i
can
let
you
have
any
more
money
you
think
in
it
for
my
health
a
wheel
in
good
condition
martin
had
argued
only
let
me
have
seven
dollars
on
it
no
not
even
seven
six
and
a
quarter
you
took
the
interest
in
you
want
some
more
bring
the
suit
had
been
the
reply
that
sent
martin
out
of
the
stuffy
little
den
so
desperate
at
heart
as
to
reflect
it
in
his
face
and
touch
his
sister
to
pity
scarcely
had
they
met
when
the
telegraph
avenue
car
came
along
and
stopped
to
take
on
a
crowd
of
afternoon
shoppers
higginbotham
divined
from
the
grip
on
her
arm
as
he
helped
her
on
that
he
was
not
going
to
follow
her
she
turned
on
the
step
and
looked
down
upon
him
his
haggard
face
smote
her
to
the
heart
again
you
she
asked
the
next
moment
she
had
descended
to
his
side
you
know
he
explained
go
along
for
a
few
blocks
she
announced
do
me
good
i
ben
any
too
spry
these
last
few
martin
glanced
at
her
and
verified
her
statement
in
her
general
slovenly
appearance
in
the
unhealthy
fat
in
the
drooping
shoulders
the
tired
face
with
the
sagging
lines
and
in
the
heavy
fall
of
her
feet
without
very
caricature
of
the
walk
that
belongs
to
a
free
and
happy
body
better
stop
here
he
said
though
she
had
already
come
to
a
halt
at
the
first
corner
take
the
next
goodness
i
all
tired
she
panted
just
as
able
to
walk
as
you
in
them
soles
that
thin
long
before
you
git
out
to
north
a
better
pair
at
home
was
the
answer
out
to
dinner
she
invited
irrelevantly
higginbotham
be
there
to
san
leandro
on
martin
shook
his
head
but
he
had
failed
to
keep
back
the
wolfish
hungry
look
that
leapt
into
his
eyes
at
the
suggestion
of
dinner
a
penny
mart
and
why
exercise
she
tried
to
sniff
contemptuously
but
succeeded
in
producing
only
a
sniffle
lem
me
and
fumbling
in
her
satchel
she
pressed
a
piece
into
his
hand
guess
i
forgot
your
last
birthday
mart
she
mumbled
lamely
hand
instinctively
closed
on
the
piece
of
gold
in
the
same
instant
he
knew
he
ought
not
to
accept
and
found
himself
struggling
in
the
throes
of
indecision
that
bit
of
gold
meant
food
life
and
light
in
his
body
and
brain
power
to
go
on
writing
was
to
say
to
write
something
that
would
bring
in
many
pieces
of
gold
clear
on
his
vision
burned
the
manuscripts
of
two
essays
he
had
just
completed
he
saw
them
under
the
table
on
top
of
the
heap
of
returned
manuscripts
for
which
he
had
no
stamps
and
he
saw
their
titles
just
as
he
had
typed
high
priests
of
mystery
and
cradle
of
he
had
never
submitted
them
anywhere
they
were
as
good
as
anything
he
had
done
in
that
line
if
only
he
had
stamps
for
them
then
the
certitude
of
his
ultimate
success
rose
up
in
him
an
able
ally
of
hunger
and
with
a
quick
movement
he
slipped
the
coin
into
his
pocket
pay
you
back
gertrude
a
hundred
times
over
he
gulped
out
his
throat
painfully
contracted
and
in
his
eyes
a
swift
hint
of
moisture
my
words
he
cried
with
abrupt
positiveness
the
year
is
out
put
an
even
hundred
of
those
little
into
your
hand
i
ask
you
to
believe
me
all
you
have
to
do
is
wait
and
nor
did
she
believe
her
incredulity
made
her
uncomfortable
and
failing
of
other
expedient
she
said
know
hungry
mart
sticking
out
all
over
you
come
in
to
meals
any
time
send
one
of
the
children
to
tell
you
when
higginbotham
to
be
there
he
waited
though
he
knew
in
his
secret
heart
what
she
was
about
to
say
so
visible
was
her
thought
process
to
him
you
think
about
time
you
got
a
job
think
win
out
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
has
faith
in
me
gertrude
except
his
voice
was
passionately
rebellious
done
good
work
already
plenty
of
it
and
sooner
or
later
it
will
do
you
know
it
is
good
he
faltered
as
the
whole
vast
field
of
literature
and
the
history
of
literature
stirred
in
his
brain
and
pointed
the
futility
of
his
attempting
to
convey
to
her
the
reasons
for
his
faith
because
better
than
per
cent
of
what
is
published
in
the
listen
to
reason
she
answered
feebly
but
with
unwavering
belief
in
the
correctness
of
her
diagnosis
of
what
was
ailing
him
listen
to
reason
she
repeated
come
to
dinner
after
martin
had
helped
her
on
the
car
he
hurried
to
the
and
invested
three
of
the
five
dollars
in
stamps
and
when
later
in
the
day
on
the
way
to
the
morse
home
he
stopped
in
at
the
to
weigh
a
large
number
of
long
bulky
envelopes
he
affixed
to
them
all
the
stamps
save
three
of
the
denomination
it
proved
a
momentous
night
for
martin
for
after
dinner
he
met
russ
brissenden
how
he
chanced
to
come
there
whose
friend
he
was
or
what
acquaintance
brought
him
martin
did
not
know
nor
had
he
the
curiosity
to
inquire
about
him
of
ruth
in
short
brissenden
struck
martin
as
anaemic
and
and
was
promptly
dismissed
from
his
mind
an
hour
later
he
decided
that
brissenden
was
a
boor
as
well
what
of
the
way
he
prowled
about
from
one
room
to
another
staring
at
the
pictures
or
poking
his
nose
into
books
and
magazines
he
picked
up
from
the
table
or
drew
from
the
shelves
though
a
stranger
in
the
house
he
finally
isolated
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
company
huddling
into
a
capacious
morris
chair
and
reading
steadily
from
a
thin
volume
he
had
drawn
from
his
pocket
as
he
read
he
abstractedly
ran
his
fingers
with
a
caressing
movement
through
his
hair
martin
noticed
him
no
more
that
evening
except
once
when
he
observed
him
chaffing
with
great
apparent
success
with
several
of
the
young
women
it
chanced
that
when
martin
was
leaving
he
overtook
brissenden
already
half
down
the
walk
to
the
street
is
that
you
martin
said
the
other
replied
with
an
ungracious
grunt
but
swung
alongside
martin
made
no
further
attempt
at
conversation
and
for
several
blocks
unbroken
silence
lay
upon
them
old
ass
the
suddenness
and
the
virulence
of
the
exclamation
startled
martin
he
felt
amused
and
at
the
same
time
was
aware
of
a
growing
dislike
for
the
other
do
you
go
to
such
a
place
for
was
abruptly
flung
at
him
after
another
block
of
silence
do
you
martin
countered
me
i
know
came
back
least
this
is
my
first
indiscretion
there
are
hours
in
each
day
and
i
must
spend
them
somehow
come
and
have
a
right
martin
answered
the
next
moment
he
was
nonplussed
by
the
readiness
of
his
acceptance
at
home
was
several
waiting
for
him
before
he
went
to
bed
and
after
he
went
to
bed
there
was
a
volume
of
weismann
waiting
for
him
to
say
nothing
of
herbert
autobiography
which
was
as
replete
for
him
with
romance
as
any
thrilling
novel
why
should
he
waste
any
time
with
this
man
he
did
not
like
was
his
thought
and
yet
it
was
not
so
much
the
man
nor
the
drink
as
was
it
what
was
associated
with
the
bright
lights
the
mirrors
and
dazzling
array
of
glasses
the
warm
and
glowing
faces
and
the
resonant
hum
of
the
voices
of
men
that
was
it
it
was
the
voices
of
men
optimistic
men
men
who
breathed
success
and
spent
their
money
for
drinks
like
men
he
was
lonely
that
was
what
was
the
matter
with
him
that
was
why
he
had
snapped
at
the
invitation
as
a
bonita
strikes
at
a
white
rag
on
a
hook
not
since
with
joe
at
shelly
hot
springs
with
the
one
exception
of
the
wine
he
took
with
the
portuguese
grocer
had
martin
had
a
drink
at
a
public
bar
mental
exhaustion
did
not
produce
a
craving
for
liquor
such
as
physical
exhaustion
did
and
he
had
felt
no
need
for
it
but
just
now
he
felt
desire
for
the
drink
or
rather
for
the
atmosphere
wherein
drinks
were
dispensed
and
disposed
of
such
a
place
was
the
grotto
where
brissenden
and
he
lounged
in
capacious
leather
chairs
and
drank
scotch
and
soda
they
talked
they
talked
about
many
things
and
now
brissenden
and
now
martin
took
turn
in
ordering
scotch
and
soda
martin
who
was
extremely
marvelled
at
the
capacity
for
liquor
and
ever
and
anon
broke
off
to
marvel
at
the
conversation
he
was
not
long
in
assuming
that
brissenden
knew
everything
and
in
deciding
that
here
was
the
second
intellectual
man
he
had
met
but
he
noted
that
brissenden
had
what
professor
caldwell
fire
the
flashing
insight
and
perception
the
flaming
uncontrol
of
genius
living
language
flowed
from
him
his
thin
lips
like
the
dies
of
a
machine
stamped
out
phrases
that
cut
and
stung
or
again
pursing
caressingly
about
the
inchoate
sound
they
articulated
the
thin
lips
shaped
soft
and
velvety
things
mellow
phrases
of
glow
and
glory
of
haunting
beauty
reverberant
of
the
mystery
and
inscrutableness
of
life
and
yet
again
the
thin
lips
were
like
a
bugle
from
which
rang
the
crash
and
tumult
of
cosmic
strife
phrases
that
sounded
clear
as
silver
that
were
luminous
as
starry
spaces
that
epitomized
the
final
word
of
science
and
yet
said
something
word
the
transcendental
truth
elusive
and
without
words
which
could
express
and
which
none
the
less
found
expression
in
the
subtle
and
all
but
ungraspable
connotations
of
common
words
he
by
some
wonder
of
vision
saw
beyond
the
farthest
outpost
of
empiricism
where
was
no
language
for
narration
and
yet
by
some
golden
miracle
of
speech
investing
known
words
with
unknown
significances
he
conveyed
to
consciousness
messages
that
were
incommunicable
to
ordinary
souls
martin
forgot
his
first
impression
of
dislike
here
was
the
best
the
books
had
to
offer
coming
true
here
was
an
intelligence
a
living
man
for
him
to
look
up
to
am
down
in
the
dirt
at
your
feet
martin
repeated
to
himself
again
and
again
studied
biology
he
said
aloud
in
significant
allusion
to
his
surprise
brissenden
shook
his
head
you
are
stating
truths
that
are
substantiated
only
by
biology
martin
insisted
and
was
rewarded
by
a
blank
stare
conclusions
are
in
line
with
the
books
which
you
must
have
am
glad
to
hear
it
was
the
answer
my
smattering
of
knowledge
should
enable
me
to
my
way
to
truth
is
most
reassuring
as
for
myself
i
never
bother
to
find
out
if
i
am
right
or
not
it
is
all
valueless
anyway
man
can
never
know
the
ultimate
are
a
disciple
of
spencer
martin
cried
triumphantly
read
him
since
adolescence
and
all
i
read
then
was
his
wish
i
could
gather
knowledge
as
carelessly
martin
broke
out
half
an
hour
later
he
had
been
closely
analyzing
mental
equipment
are
a
sheer
dogmatist
and
what
makes
it
so
marvellous
you
state
dogmatically
the
latest
facts
which
science
has
been
able
to
establish
only
by
reasoning
you
jump
at
correct
conclusions
you
certainly
with
a
vengeance
you
feel
your
way
with
the
speed
of
light
by
some
hyperrational
process
to
that
was
what
used
to
bother
father
joseph
and
brother
dutton
brissenden
replied
no
he
added
am
not
anything
it
was
a
lucky
trick
of
fate
that
sent
me
to
a
catholic
college
for
my
education
where
did
you
pick
up
what
you
know
and
while
martin
told
him
he
was
busy
studying
brissenden
ranging
from
a
long
lean
aristocratic
face
and
drooping
shoulders
to
the
overcoat
on
a
neighboring
chair
its
pockets
sagged
and
bulged
by
the
freightage
of
many
books
face
and
long
slender
hands
were
browned
by
the
browned
martin
thought
this
sunburn
bothered
martin
it
was
patent
that
brissenden
was
no
outdoor
man
then
how
had
he
been
ravaged
by
the
sun
something
morbid
and
significant
attached
to
that
sunburn
was
thought
as
he
returned
to
a
study
of
the
face
narrow
with
high
and
cavernous
hollows
and
graced
with
as
delicate
and
fine
an
aquiline
nose
as
martin
had
ever
seen
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
size
of
the
eyes
they
were
neither
large
nor
small
while
their
color
was
a
nondescript
brown
but
in
them
smouldered
a
fire
or
rather
lurked
an
expression
dual
and
strangely
contradictory
defiant
indomitable
even
harsh
to
excess
they
at
the
same
time
aroused
pity
martin
found
himself
pitying
him
he
knew
not
why
though
he
was
soon
to
learn
a
lunger
brissenden
announced
offhand
a
little
later
having
already
stated
that
he
came
from
arizona
been
down
there
a
couple
of
years
living
on
the
you
afraid
to
venture
it
up
in
this
climate
there
was
no
special
emphasis
of
his
repetition
of
word
but
martin
saw
in
that
ascetic
face
the
advertisement
that
there
was
nothing
of
which
it
was
afraid
the
eyes
had
narrowed
till
they
were
and
martin
almost
caught
his
breath
as
he
noted
the
eagle
beak
with
its
dilated
nostrils
defiant
assertive
aggressive
magnificent
was
what
he
commented
to
himself
his
blood
thrilling
at
the
sight
aloud
he
quoted
the
bludgeoning
of
chance
my
head
is
bloody
but
like
henley
brissenden
said
his
expression
changing
swiftly
to
large
graciousness
and
tenderness
course
i
have
expected
anything
else
of
you
ah
henley
a
brave
soul
he
stands
out
among
contemporary
a
gladiator
stands
out
in
the
midst
of
a
band
of
like
the
magazines
martin
softly
impeached
you
was
snarled
back
at
him
so
savagely
as
to
startle
him
write
or
rather
try
to
write
for
the
magazines
martin
faltered
better
was
the
mollified
rejoinder
try
to
write
but
you
succeed
i
respect
and
admire
your
failure
i
know
what
you
write
i
can
see
it
with
half
an
eye
and
one
ingredient
in
it
that
shuts
it
out
of
the
magazines
guts
and
magazines
have
no
use
for
that
particular
commodity
what
they
want
is
and
slush
and
god
knows
they
get
it
but
not
from
not
above
martin
contended
the
brissenden
paused
and
ran
an
insolent
eye
over
objective
poverty
passing
from
the
tie
and
the
collar
to
the
shiny
sleeves
of
the
coat
and
on
to
the
slight
fray
of
one
cuff
winding
up
and
dwelling
upon
sunken
cheeks
the
contrary
is
above
you
so
far
above
you
that
you
can
never
hope
to
rise
to
it
why
man
i
could
insult
you
by
asking
you
to
have
something
to
martin
felt
the
heat
in
his
face
of
the
involuntary
blood
and
brissenden
laughed
triumphantly
full
man
is
not
insulted
by
such
an
invitation
he
concluded
are
a
devil
martin
cried
irritably
i
ask
i
know
about
that
i
invite
you
brissenden
half
rose
from
his
chair
as
he
spoke
as
if
with
the
intention
of
departing
to
the
restaurant
forthwith
fists
were
and
his
blood
was
drumming
in
his
temples
he
eats
alive
eats
alive
brissenden
exclaimed
imitating
the
of
a
locally
famous
could
certainly
eat
you
alive
martin
said
in
turn
running
insolent
eyes
over
the
frame
not
worthy
of
it
the
contrary
martin
considered
the
incident
is
not
he
broke
into
a
laugh
hearty
and
wholesome
confess
you
made
a
fool
of
me
brissenden
that
i
am
hungry
and
you
are
aware
of
it
are
only
ordinary
phenomena
and
no
disgrace
you
see
i
laugh
at
the
conventional
little
moralities
of
the
herd
then
you
drift
by
say
a
sharp
true
word
and
immediately
i
am
the
slave
of
the
same
little
were
insulted
brissenden
affirmed
certainly
was
a
moment
ago
the
prejudice
of
early
youth
you
know
i
learned
such
things
then
and
they
cheapen
what
i
have
since
learned
they
are
the
skeletons
in
my
particular
got
the
door
shut
on
them
now
certainly
go
and
get
something
to
go
you
martin
answered
attempting
to
pay
for
the
current
scotch
and
soda
with
the
last
change
from
his
two
dollars
and
seeing
the
waiter
bullied
by
brissenden
into
putting
that
change
back
on
the
table
martin
pocketed
it
with
a
grimace
and
felt
for
a
moment
the
kindly
weight
of
hand
upon
his
shoulder
chapter
xxxii
promptly
the
next
afternoon
maria
was
excited
by
second
visitor
but
she
did
not
lose
her
head
this
time
for
she
seated
brissenden
in
her
grandeur
of
respectability
you
mind
my
coming
brissenden
began
no
not
at
all
martin
answered
shaking
hands
and
waving
him
to
the
solitary
chair
himself
taking
to
the
bed
how
did
you
know
where
i
lived
up
the
morses
miss
morse
answered
the
and
here
i
he
tugged
at
his
coat
pocket
and
flung
a
thin
volume
on
the
table
a
book
by
a
poet
read
it
and
keep
and
then
in
reply
to
protest
have
i
to
do
with
books
i
had
another
hemorrhage
this
morning
got
any
whiskey
no
of
course
not
wait
a
he
was
off
and
away
martin
watched
his
long
figure
go
down
the
outside
steps
and
on
turning
to
close
the
gate
noted
with
a
pang
the
shoulders
which
had
once
been
broad
drawn
in
now
over
the
collapsed
ruin
of
the
chest
martin
got
two
tumblers
and
fell
to
reading
the
book
of
verse
henry
vaughn
latest
collection
scotch
brissenden
announced
on
his
return
beggar
sells
nothing
but
american
whiskey
but
a
quart
of
send
one
of
the
youngsters
for
lemons
and
make
a
toddy
martin
offered
wonder
what
a
book
like
that
will
earn
marlow
he
went
on
holding
up
the
volume
in
question
fifty
dollars
came
the
answer
lucky
if
he
pulls
even
on
it
or
if
he
can
inveigle
a
publisher
to
risk
bringing
it
one
make
a
living
out
of
poetry
tone
and
face
alike
showed
his
dejection
not
what
fool
expects
to
out
of
rhyming
yes
bruce
and
virginia
spring
and
sedgwick
they
do
very
nicely
but
you
know
how
vaughn
marlow
makes
his
living
in
a
down
in
pennsylvania
and
of
all
private
little
hells
such
a
billet
is
the
limit
i
trade
places
with
him
if
he
had
fifty
years
of
life
before
him
and
yet
his
work
stands
out
from
the
ruck
of
the
contemporary
versifiers
as
a
balas
ruby
among
carrots
and
the
reviews
he
gets
damn
them
all
of
them
the
crass
manikins
much
is
written
by
the
men
who
write
about
the
men
who
do
write
martin
concurred
i
was
appalled
at
the
quantities
of
rubbish
written
about
stevenson
and
his
and
harpies
brissenden
snapped
out
with
clicking
teeth
i
know
the
pecking
at
him
for
his
father
damien
letter
analyzing
him
weighing
him
by
the
yardstick
of
their
own
miserable
egos
martin
broke
in
it
a
good
phrase
and
besliming
the
true
and
beautiful
and
good
and
finally
patting
him
on
the
back
and
saying
dog
faugh
little
chattering
daws
of
men
richard
realf
called
them
the
night
he
at
martin
took
up
the
strain
warmly
the
meteoric
flight
of
the
i
once
wrote
a
squib
on
critics
or
the
reviewers
see
it
brissenden
begged
eagerly
so
martin
unearthed
a
carbon
copy
of
and
during
the
reading
of
it
brissenden
chuckled
rubbed
his
hands
and
forgot
to
sip
his
toddy
me
a
bit
of
yourself
flung
into
a
world
of
cowled
gnomes
who
can
not
see
was
his
comment
at
the
end
of
it
course
it
was
snapped
up
by
the
first
magazine
martin
ran
over
the
pages
of
his
manuscript
book
has
been
refused
by
of
brissenden
essayed
a
long
and
hearty
laugh
but
broke
down
in
a
fit
of
coughing
you
tell
me
you
tackled
poetry
he
gasped
me
see
some
of
read
it
now
martin
pleaded
want
to
talk
with
you
make
up
a
bundle
and
you
can
take
it
brissenden
departed
with
the
and
peri
and
the
pearl
returning
next
day
to
greet
martin
with
want
not
only
did
he
assure
martin
that
he
was
a
poet
but
martin
learned
that
brissenden
also
was
one
he
was
swept
off
his
feet
by
the
work
and
astounded
that
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
publish
it
plague
on
all
their
houses
was
answer
to
volunteering
to
market
his
work
for
him
beauty
for
its
own
sake
was
his
counsel
leave
the
magazines
alone
back
to
your
ships
and
your
my
advice
to
you
martin
eden
what
do
you
want
in
these
sick
and
rotten
cities
of
men
you
are
cutting
your
throat
every
day
you
waste
in
them
trying
to
prostitute
beauty
to
the
needs
of
magazinedom
what
was
it
you
quoted
me
the
other
day
yes
the
latest
of
the
well
what
do
you
the
latest
of
the
ephemera
want
with
fame
if
you
got
it
it
would
be
poison
to
you
you
are
too
simple
too
elemental
and
too
rational
by
my
faith
to
prosper
on
such
pap
i
hope
you
never
do
sell
a
line
to
the
magazines
beauty
is
the
only
master
to
serve
serve
her
and
damn
the
multitude
success
what
in
success
if
it
right
there
in
your
stevenson
sonnet
which
outranks
in
that
in
those
is
not
in
what
you
succeed
in
doing
that
you
get
your
joy
but
in
the
doing
of
it
you
tell
me
i
know
it
you
know
it
beauty
hurts
you
it
is
an
everlasting
pain
in
you
a
wound
that
does
not
heal
a
knife
of
flame
why
should
you
palter
with
magazines
let
beauty
be
your
end
why
should
you
mint
beauty
into
gold
anyway
you
so
no
use
in
my
getting
excited
over
it
you
can
read
the
magazines
for
a
thousand
years
and
you
find
the
value
of
one
line
of
keats
leave
fame
and
coin
alone
sign
away
on
a
ship
and
go
back
to
your
for
fame
but
for
love
martin
laughed
seems
to
have
no
place
in
your
cosmos
in
mine
beauty
is
the
handmaiden
of
brissenden
looked
at
him
pityingly
and
admiringly
are
so
young
martin
boy
so
young
you
will
flutter
high
but
your
wings
are
of
the
finest
gauze
dusted
with
the
fairest
pigments
do
not
scorch
them
but
of
course
you
have
scorched
them
already
it
required
some
glorified
petticoat
to
account
for
that
and
the
shame
of
glorifies
love
as
well
as
the
petticoat
martin
laughed
philosophy
of
madness
was
the
retort
have
i
assured
myself
when
wandering
in
hasheesh
dreams
but
beware
these
bourgeois
cities
will
kill
you
look
at
that
den
of
traitors
where
i
met
you
dry
rot
is
no
name
for
it
one
keep
his
sanity
in
such
an
atmosphere
degrading
not
one
of
them
who
is
not
degrading
man
and
woman
all
of
them
animated
stomachs
guided
by
the
high
intellectual
and
artistic
impulses
of
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
regarded
martin
then
with
a
flash
of
divination
he
saw
the
situation
the
expression
on
his
face
turned
to
wondering
horror
you
wrote
that
tremendous
to
pale
shrivelled
female
thing
the
next
instant
right
hand
had
shot
to
a
throttling
clutch
on
his
throat
and
he
was
being
shaken
till
his
teeth
rattled
but
martin
looking
into
his
eyes
saw
no
fear
there
but
a
curious
and
mocking
devil
martin
remembered
himself
and
flung
brissenden
by
the
neck
sidelong
upon
the
bed
at
the
same
moment
releasing
his
hold
brissenden
panted
and
gasped
painfully
for
a
moment
then
began
to
chuckle
had
made
me
eternally
your
debtor
had
you
shaken
out
the
flame
he
said
nerves
are
on
a
these
days
martin
apologized
i
hurt
you
here
let
me
mix
a
fresh
you
young
greek
brissenden
went
on
wonder
if
you
take
just
pride
in
that
body
of
yours
you
are
devilish
strong
you
are
a
young
panther
a
lion
cub
well
well
it
is
you
who
must
pay
for
that
do
you
mean
martin
asked
curiously
passing
him
a
glass
down
this
and
be
brissenden
sipped
his
toddy
and
smiled
appreciation
of
it
of
the
women
they
will
worry
you
until
you
die
as
they
have
already
worried
you
or
else
i
was
born
yesterday
now
no
use
in
your
choking
me
going
to
have
my
say
this
is
undoubtedly
your
calf
love
but
for
sake
show
better
taste
next
time
what
under
heaven
do
you
want
with
a
daughter
of
the
bourgeoisie
leave
them
alone
pick
out
some
great
wanton
flame
of
a
woman
who
laughs
at
life
and
jeers
at
death
and
loves
one
while
she
may
there
are
such
women
and
they
will
love
you
just
as
readily
as
any
pusillanimous
product
of
bourgeois
sheltered
martin
protested
so
pusillanimous
prattling
out
little
moralities
that
have
been
prattled
into
them
and
afraid
to
live
life
they
will
love
you
martin
but
they
will
love
their
little
moralities
more
what
you
want
is
the
magnificent
abandon
of
life
the
great
free
souls
the
blazing
butterflies
and
not
the
little
gray
moths
oh
you
will
grow
tired
of
them
too
of
all
the
female
things
if
you
are
unlucky
enough
to
live
but
you
live
you
go
back
to
your
ships
and
sea
therefore
hang
around
these
of
cities
until
your
bones
are
rotten
and
then
can
lecture
me
but
you
make
me
talk
back
martin
said
all
you
have
but
the
wisdom
of
your
temperament
and
the
wisdom
of
my
temperament
is
just
as
unimpeachable
as
they
disagreed
about
love
and
the
magazines
and
many
things
but
they
liked
each
other
and
on
part
it
was
no
less
than
a
profound
liking
day
after
day
they
were
together
if
for
no
more
than
the
hour
brissenden
spent
in
stuffy
room
brissenden
never
arrived
without
his
quart
of
whiskey
and
when
they
dined
together
he
drank
scotch
and
soda
throughout
the
meal
he
invariably
paid
the
way
for
both
and
it
was
through
him
that
martin
learned
the
refinements
of
food
drank
his
first
champagne
and
made
acquaintance
with
rhenish
wines
but
brissenden
was
always
an
enigma
with
the
face
of
an
ascetic
he
was
in
all
the
failing
blood
of
him
a
frank
voluptuary
he
was
unafraid
to
die
bitter
and
cynical
of
all
the
ways
of
living
and
yet
dying
he
loved
life
to
the
last
atom
of
it
he
was
possessed
by
a
madness
to
live
to
thrill
squirm
my
little
space
in
the
cosmic
dust
whence
i
came
as
he
phrased
it
once
himself
he
had
tampered
with
drugs
and
done
many
strange
things
in
quest
of
new
thrills
new
sensations
as
he
told
martin
he
had
once
gone
three
days
without
water
had
done
so
voluntarily
in
order
to
experience
the
exquisite
delight
of
such
a
thirst
assuaged
who
or
what
he
was
martin
never
learned
he
was
a
man
without
a
past
whose
future
was
the
imminent
grave
and
whose
present
was
a
bitter
fever
of
living
chapter
xxxiii
martin
was
steadily
losing
his
battle
economize
as
he
would
the
earnings
from
did
not
balance
expenses
thanksgiving
found
him
with
his
black
suit
in
pawn
and
unable
to
accept
the
invitation
to
dinner
ruth
was
not
made
happy
by
his
reason
for
not
coming
and
the
corresponding
effect
on
him
was
one
of
desperation
he
told
her
that
he
would
come
after
all
that
he
would
go
over
to
san
francisco
to
the
office
collect
the
five
dollars
due
him
and
with
it
redeem
his
suit
of
clothes
in
the
morning
he
borrowed
ten
cents
from
maria
he
would
have
borrowed
it
by
preference
from
brissenden
but
that
erratic
individual
had
disappeared
two
weeks
had
passed
since
martin
had
seen
him
and
he
vainly
cudgelled
his
brains
for
some
cause
of
offence
the
ten
cents
carried
martin
across
the
ferry
to
san
francisco
and
as
he
walked
up
market
street
he
speculated
upon
his
predicament
in
case
he
failed
to
collect
the
money
there
would
then
be
no
way
for
him
to
return
to
oakland
and
he
knew
no
one
in
san
francisco
from
whom
to
borrow
another
ten
cents
the
door
to
the
office
was
ajar
and
martin
in
the
act
of
opening
it
was
brought
to
a
sudden
pause
by
a
loud
voice
from
within
which
exclaimed
that
is
not
the
question
ford
martin
knew
from
his
correspondence
to
be
the
name
question
is
are
you
prepared
to
pay
and
cash
down
i
mean
i
am
not
interested
in
the
prospects
of
the
and
what
you
expect
to
make
it
next
year
what
i
want
is
to
be
paid
for
what
i
do
and
i
tell
you
right
now
the
christmas
go
to
press
till
i
have
the
money
in
my
hand
good
day
when
you
get
the
money
come
and
see
the
door
jerked
open
and
the
man
flung
past
martin
with
an
angry
countenance
and
went
down
the
corridor
muttering
curses
and
clenching
his
fists
martin
decided
not
to
enter
immediately
and
lingered
in
the
hallways
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
he
shoved
the
door
open
and
walked
in
it
was
a
new
experience
the
first
time
he
had
been
inside
an
editorial
office
cards
evidently
were
not
necessary
in
that
office
for
the
boy
carried
word
to
an
inner
room
that
there
was
a
man
who
wanted
to
see
ford
returning
the
boy
beckoned
him
from
halfway
across
the
room
and
led
him
to
the
private
office
the
editorial
sanctum
first
impression
was
of
the
disorder
and
cluttered
confusion
of
the
room
next
he
noticed
a
bewhiskered
man
sitting
at
a
desk
who
regarded
him
curiously
martin
marvelled
at
the
calm
repose
of
his
face
it
was
evident
that
the
squabble
with
the
printer
had
not
affected
his
equanimity
am
martin
eden
martin
began
the
conversation
i
want
my
five
dollars
was
what
he
would
have
liked
to
say
but
this
was
his
first
editor
and
under
the
circumstances
he
did
not
desire
to
scare
him
too
abruptly
to
his
surprise
ford
leaped
into
the
air
with
a
say
so
and
the
next
moment
with
both
hands
was
shaking
hand
effusively
say
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
eden
often
wondered
what
you
were
here
he
held
martin
off
at
length
and
ran
his
beaming
eyes
over
suit
which
was
also
his
worst
suit
and
which
was
ragged
and
past
repair
though
the
trousers
showed
the
careful
crease
he
had
put
in
with
confess
though
i
conceived
you
to
be
a
much
older
man
than
you
are
your
story
you
know
showed
such
breadth
and
vigor
such
maturity
and
depth
of
thought
a
masterpiece
that
knew
it
when
i
had
read
the
first
lines
let
me
tell
you
how
i
first
read
it
but
no
first
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
still
talking
ford
led
him
into
the
general
office
where
he
introduced
him
to
the
associate
editor
white
a
slender
frail
little
man
whose
hand
seemed
strangely
cold
as
if
he
were
suffering
from
a
chill
and
whose
whiskers
were
sparse
and
silky
ends
eden
ends
is
our
business
manager
you
martin
found
himself
shaking
hands
with
a
man
whose
face
looked
youthful
enough
from
what
little
could
be
seen
of
it
for
most
of
it
was
covered
by
a
beard
carefully
his
wife
who
did
it
on
sundays
at
which
times
she
also
shaved
the
back
of
his
neck
the
three
men
surrounded
martin
all
talking
admiringly
and
at
once
until
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
talking
against
time
for
a
wager
often
wondered
why
you
call
white
was
saying
have
the
carfare
and
i
live
across
the
bay
martin
answered
bluntly
with
the
idea
of
showing
them
his
imperative
need
for
the
money
surely
he
thought
to
himself
my
glad
rags
in
themselves
are
eloquent
advertisement
of
my
need
time
and
again
whenever
opportunity
offered
he
hinted
about
the
purpose
of
his
business
but
his
ears
were
deaf
they
sang
his
praises
told
him
what
they
had
thought
of
his
story
at
first
sight
what
they
subsequently
thought
what
their
wives
and
families
thought
but
not
one
hint
did
they
breathe
of
intention
to
pay
him
for
it
i
tell
you
how
i
first
read
your
story
ford
said
course
i
i
was
coming
west
from
new
york
and
when
the
train
stopped
at
ogden
the
on
the
new
run
brought
aboard
the
current
number
of
the
my
god
martin
thought
you
can
travel
in
a
pullman
while
i
starve
for
the
paltry
five
dollars
you
owe
me
a
wave
of
anger
rushed
over
him
the
wrong
done
him
by
the
loomed
colossal
for
strong
upon
him
were
all
the
dreary
months
of
vain
yearning
of
hunger
and
privation
and
his
present
hunger
awoke
and
gnawed
at
him
reminding
him
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
day
before
and
little
enough
then
for
the
moment
he
saw
red
these
creatures
were
not
even
robbers
they
were
by
lies
and
broken
promises
they
had
tricked
him
out
of
his
story
well
he
would
show
them
and
a
great
resolve
surged
into
his
will
to
the
effect
that
he
would
not
leave
the
office
until
he
got
his
money
he
remembered
if
he
did
not
get
it
that
there
was
no
way
for
him
to
go
back
to
oakland
he
controlled
himself
with
an
effort
but
not
before
the
wolfish
expression
of
his
face
had
awed
and
perturbed
them
they
became
more
voluble
than
ever
ford
started
anew
to
tell
how
he
had
first
read
ring
of
bells
and
ends
at
the
same
time
was
striving
to
repeat
his
appreciation
of
ring
of
bells
said
niece
being
a
in
alameda
tell
you
what
i
came
for
martin
said
finally
be
paid
for
that
story
all
of
you
like
so
well
five
dollars
i
believe
is
what
you
promised
me
would
be
paid
on
ford
with
an
expression
on
his
mobile
features
of
mediate
and
happy
acquiescence
started
to
reach
for
his
pocket
then
turned
suddenly
to
ends
and
said
that
he
had
left
his
money
home
that
ends
resented
this
was
patent
and
martin
saw
the
twitch
of
his
arm
as
if
to
protect
his
trousers
pocket
martin
knew
that
the
money
was
there
am
sorry
said
ends
i
paid
the
printer
not
an
hour
ago
and
he
took
my
ready
change
it
was
careless
of
me
to
be
so
short
but
the
bill
was
not
yet
due
and
the
request
as
a
favor
to
make
an
immediate
advance
was
quite
both
men
looked
expectantly
at
white
but
that
gentleman
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
conscience
was
clean
at
any
rate
he
had
come
into
the
to
learn
instead
of
which
he
had
principally
learned
finance
the
owed
him
four
salary
and
he
knew
that
the
printer
must
be
appeased
before
the
associate
editor
rather
absurd
eden
to
have
caught
us
in
this
shape
ford
preambled
airily
carelessness
i
assure
you
but
tell
you
what
do
mail
you
a
check
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
you
have
address
you
ends
yes
ends
had
the
address
and
the
check
would
be
mailed
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
knowledge
of
banks
and
checks
was
hazy
but
he
could
see
no
reason
why
they
should
not
give
him
the
check
on
this
day
just
as
well
as
on
the
next
it
is
understood
eden
that
mail
you
the
check
ford
said
need
the
money
martin
answered
stolidly
unfortunate
you
had
chanced
here
any
other
day
ford
began
suavely
only
to
be
interrupted
by
ends
whose
cranky
eyes
justified
themselves
in
his
shortness
of
temper
ford
has
already
explained
the
situation
he
said
with
asperity
so
have
i
the
check
will
be
also
have
explained
martin
broke
in
i
have
explained
that
i
want
the
money
he
had
felt
his
pulse
quicken
a
trifle
at
the
business
brusqueness
and
upon
him
he
kept
an
alert
eye
for
it
was
in
that
trousers
pocket
that
he
divined
the
ready
cash
was
reposing
is
too
ford
began
but
at
that
moment
with
an
impatient
movement
ends
turned
as
if
about
to
leave
the
room
at
the
same
instant
martin
sprang
for
him
clutching
him
by
the
throat
with
one
hand
in
such
fashion
that
beard
still
maintaining
its
immaculate
trimness
pointed
ceilingward
at
an
angle
of
degrees
to
the
horror
of
white
and
ford
they
saw
their
business
manager
shaken
like
an
astrakhan
rug
up
you
venerable
discourager
of
rising
young
talent
martin
exhorted
up
or
shake
it
out
of
you
even
if
all
in
then
to
the
two
affrighted
onlookers
away
if
you
interfere
liable
to
get
ends
was
choking
and
it
was
not
until
the
grip
on
his
throat
was
eased
that
he
was
able
to
signify
his
acquiescence
in
the
programme
all
together
after
repeated
digs
its
trousers
pocket
yielded
four
dollars
and
fifteen
cents
out
with
it
martin
commanded
an
additional
ten
cents
fell
out
martin
counted
the
result
of
his
raid
a
second
time
to
make
sure
next
he
shouted
at
ford
want
cents
ford
did
not
wait
but
ransacked
his
pockets
with
the
result
of
sixty
cents
that
is
all
martin
demanded
menacingly
possessing
himself
of
it
have
you
got
in
your
vest
pockets
in
token
of
his
good
faith
ford
turned
two
of
his
pockets
inside
out
a
strip
of
cardboard
fell
to
the
floor
from
one
of
them
he
recovered
it
and
was
in
the
act
of
returning
it
when
martin
cried
that
ferry
ticket
here
give
it
to
me
worth
ten
cents
credit
you
with
it
now
got
four
dollars
and
cents
including
the
ticket
five
cents
is
still
due
he
looked
fiercely
at
white
and
found
that
fragile
creature
in
the
act
of
handing
him
a
nickel
you
martin
said
addressing
them
collectively
wish
you
a
good
ends
snarled
after
him
martin
retorted
slamming
the
door
as
he
passed
out
martin
was
elated
that
when
he
recollected
that
owed
him
fifteen
dollars
for
peri
and
the
pearl
he
decided
forthwith
to
go
and
collect
it
but
was
run
by
a
set
of
strapping
young
men
frank
buccaneers
who
robbed
everything
and
everybody
not
excepting
one
another
after
some
breakage
of
the
office
furniture
the
editor
an
athlete
ably
assisted
by
the
business
manager
an
advertising
agent
and
the
porter
succeeded
in
removing
martin
from
the
office
and
in
accelerating
by
initial
impulse
his
descent
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
again
eden
glad
to
see
you
any
time
they
laughed
down
at
him
from
the
landing
above

as
he
picked
himself
up
he
murmured

you

of
more

greeted
this

you
can
go
some
yourself
where
did
you

i
may
ask

going
to
have
a
black

your

up
the

wished
solicitously
do
you

chapter
xxxiv
arthur
remained
at
the
gate
while
ruth
climbed
front
steps
she
heard
the
rapid
click
of
the
and
when
martin
let
her
in
found
him
on
the
last
page
of
a
manuscript
she
had
come
to
make
certain
whether
or
not
he
would
be
at
their
table
for
thanksgiving
dinner
but
before
she
could
broach
the
subject
martin
plunged
into
the
one
with
which
he
was
full
let
me
read
you
this
he
cried
separating
the
carbon
copies
and
running
the
pages
of
manuscript
into
shape
my
latest
and
different
from
anything
done
it
is
so
altogether
different
that
i
am
almost
afraid
of
it
and
yet
a
sneaking
idea
it
is
good
you
be
judge
an
hawaiian
story
called
it
his
face
was
bright
with
the
creative
glow
though
she
shivered
in
the
cold
room
and
had
been
struck
by
the
coldness
of
his
hands
at
greeting
she
listened
closely
while
he
read
and
though
he
from
time
to
time
had
seen
only
disapprobation
in
her
face
at
the
close
he
asked
what
do
you
think
of
it
know
she
answered
you
think
it
will
sell
afraid
not
was
the
confession
too
strong
for
the
magazines
but
true
on
my
word
why
do
you
persist
in
writing
such
things
when
you
know
they
sell
she
went
on
inexorably
reason
for
your
writing
is
to
make
a
living
it
right
but
the
miserable
story
got
away
with
me
i
help
writing
it
it
demanded
to
be
that
character
that
why
do
you
make
him
talk
so
roughly
surely
it
will
offend
your
readers
and
surely
that
is
why
the
editors
are
justified
in
refusing
your
the
real
would
have
talked
that
it
is
not
good
is
life
he
replied
bluntly
is
real
it
is
true
and
i
must
write
life
as
i
see
she
made
no
answer
and
for
an
awkward
moment
they
sat
silent
it
was
because
he
loved
her
that
he
did
not
quite
understand
her
and
she
could
not
understand
him
because
he
was
so
large
that
he
bulked
beyond
her
horizon
collected
from
the
he
said
in
an
effort
to
shift
the
conversation
to
a
more
comfortable
subject
the
picture
of
the
bewhiskered
trio
as
he
had
last
seen
them
mulcted
of
four
dollars
and
ninety
cents
and
a
ferry
ticket
made
him
chuckle
come
she
cried
joyously
was
what
i
came
to
find
he
muttered
absently
to
dinner
you
know
you
said
recover
your
suit
if
you
got
that
forgot
all
about
it
he
said
humbly
see
this
morning
the
poundman
got
two
cows
and
the
baby
calf
it
happened
that
maria
have
any
money
and
so
i
had
to
recover
her
cows
for
her
where
the
fiver
ring
of
went
into
the
you
come
he
looked
down
at
his
clothing
tears
of
disappointment
and
reproach
glistened
in
her
blue
eyes
but
she
said
nothing
thanksgiving
have
dinner
with
me
in
he
said
cheerily
in
london
or
paris
or
anywhere
you
wish
i
know
saw
in
the
paper
a
few
days
ago
she
announced
abruptly
there
had
been
several
local
appointments
to
the
railway
mail
you
passed
first
you
he
was
compelled
to
admit
that
the
call
had
come
for
him
but
that
he
had
declined
it
was
so
am
so
myself
he
concluded
year
from
now
be
earning
more
than
a
dozen
men
in
the
railway
mail
you
wait
and
was
all
she
said
when
he
finished
she
stood
up
pulling
at
her
gloves
must
go
martin
arthur
is
waiting
for
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
but
she
proved
a
passive
sweetheart
there
was
no
tenseness
in
her
body
her
arms
did
not
go
around
him
and
her
lips
met
his
without
their
wonted
pressure
she
was
angry
with
him
he
concluded
as
he
returned
from
the
gate
but
why
it
was
unfortunate
that
the
poundman
had
gobbled
cows
but
it
was
only
a
stroke
of
fate
nobody
could
be
blamed
for
it
nor
did
it
enter
his
head
that
he
could
have
done
aught
otherwise
than
what
he
had
done
well
yes
he
was
to
blame
a
little
was
his
next
thought
for
having
refused
the
call
to
the
railway
mail
and
she
had
not
liked
he
turned
at
the
head
of
the
steps
to
meet
the
on
his
afternoon
round
the
ever
recurrent
fever
of
expectancy
assailed
martin
as
he
took
the
bundle
of
long
envelopes
one
was
not
long
it
was
short
and
thin
and
outside
was
printed
the
address
of
new
york
he
paused
in
the
act
of
tearing
the
envelope
open
it
could
not
be
an
acceptance
he
had
no
manuscripts
with
that
publication
heart
almost
stood
still
at
they
were
ordering
an
article
from
him
but
the
next
instant
he
dismissed
the
surmise
as
hopelessly
impossible
it
was
a
short
formal
letter
signed
by
the
office
editor
merely
informing
him
that
an
anonymous
letter
which
they
had
received
was
enclosed
and
that
he
could
rest
assured
the
staff
never
under
any
circumstances
gave
consideration
to
anonymous
correspondence
the
enclosed
letter
martin
found
to
be
crudely
printed
by
hand
it
was
a
hotchpotch
of
illiterate
abuse
of
martin
and
of
assertion
that
the
martin
who
was
selling
stories
to
magazines
was
no
writer
at
all
and
that
in
reality
he
was
stealing
stories
from
old
magazines
typing
them
and
sending
them
out
as
his
own
the
envelope
was
postmarked
martin
did
not
require
a
second
thought
to
discover
the
author
grammar
colloquialisms
mental
quirks
and
processes
were
apparent
throughout
martin
saw
in
every
line
not
the
fine
italian
hand
but
the
coarse
fist
of
his
but
why
he
vainly
questioned
what
injury
had
he
done
bernard
higginbotham
the
thing
was
so
unreasonable
so
wanton
there
was
no
explaining
it
in
the
course
of
the
week
a
dozen
similar
letters
were
forwarded
to
martin
by
the
editors
of
various
eastern
magazines
the
editors
were
behaving
handsomely
martin
concluded
he
was
wholly
unknown
to
them
yet
some
of
them
had
even
been
sympathetic
it
was
evident
that
they
detested
anonymity
he
saw
that
the
malicious
attempt
to
hurt
him
had
failed
in
fact
if
anything
came
of
it
it
was
bound
to
be
good
for
at
least
his
name
had
been
called
to
the
attention
of
a
number
of
editors
sometime
perhaps
reading
a
submitted
manuscript
of
his
they
might
remember
him
as
the
fellow
about
whom
they
had
received
an
anonymous
letter
and
who
was
to
say
that
such
a
remembrance
might
not
sway
the
balance
of
their
judgment
just
a
trifle
in
his
favor
it
was
about
this
time
that
martin
took
a
great
slump
in
estimation
he
found
her
in
the
kitchen
one
morning
groaning
with
pain
tears
of
weakness
running
down
her
cheeks
vainly
endeavoring
to
put
through
a
large
ironing
he
promptly
diagnosed
her
affliction
as
la
grippe
dosed
her
with
hot
whiskey
the
remnants
in
the
bottles
for
which
brissenden
was
responsible
and
ordered
her
to
bed
but
maria
was
refractory
the
ironing
had
to
be
done
she
protested
and
delivered
that
night
or
else
there
would
be
no
food
on
the
morrow
for
the
seven
small
and
hungry
silvas
to
her
astonishment
and
it
was
something
that
she
never
ceased
from
relating
to
her
dying
day
she
saw
martin
eden
seize
an
iron
from
the
stove
and
throw
a
fancy
on
the
it
was
kate
best
sunday
waist
than
whom
there
was
no
more
exacting
and
fastidiously
dressed
woman
in
world
also
miss
flanagan
had
sent
special
instruction
that
said
waist
must
be
delivered
by
that
night
as
every
one
knew
she
was
keeping
company
with
john
collins
the
blacksmith
and
as
maria
knew
privily
miss
flanagan
and
collins
were
going
next
day
to
golden
gate
park
vain
was
attempt
to
rescue
the
garment
martin
guided
her
tottering
footsteps
to
a
chair
from
where
she
watched
him
with
bulging
eyes
in
a
quarter
of
the
time
it
would
have
taken
her
she
saw
the
safely
ironed
and
ironed
as
well
as
she
could
have
done
it
as
martin
made
her
grant
could
work
faster
he
explained
your
irons
were
only
to
her
the
irons
he
swung
were
much
hotter
than
she
ever
dared
to
use
sprinkling
is
all
wrong
he
complained
next
let
me
teach
you
how
to
sprinkle
pressure
is
wanted
sprinkle
under
pressure
if
you
want
to
iron
he
procured
a
from
the
woodpile
in
the
cellar
fitted
a
cover
to
it
and
raided
the
the
silva
tribe
was
collecting
for
the
junkman
with
garments
in
the
box
covered
with
the
board
and
pressed
by
the
iron
the
device
was
complete
and
in
operation
you
watch
me
maria
he
said
stripping
off
to
his
undershirt
and
gripping
an
iron
that
was
what
he
called
when
he
feenish

to

to
the

rafters
so
that
the

played
upon

mister
nevertheless
by
his
masterly
operation
and
improvement
of
her
he
fell
an
immense
distance
in
her
regard
the
glamour
of
romance
with
which
her
imagination
had
invested
him
faded
away
in
the
cold
light
of
fact
that
he
was
an
all
his
books
and
his
grand
friends
who
visited
him
in
carriages
or
with
countless
bottles
of
whiskey
went
for
naught
he
was
after
all
a
mere
workingman
a
member
of
her
own
class
and
caste
he
was
more
human
and
approachable
but
he
was
no
longer
mystery
alienation
from
his
family
continued
following
upon
unprovoked
attack
hermann
von
schmidt
showed
his
hand
the
fortunate
sale
of
several
storiettes
some
humorous
verse
and
a
few
jokes
gave
martin
a
temporary
splurge
of
prosperity
not
only
did
he
partially
pay
up
his
bills
but
he
had
sufficient
balance
left
to
redeem
his
black
suit
and
wheel
the
latter
by
virtue
of
a
twisted
required
repairing
and
as
a
matter
of
friendliness
with
his
future
he
sent
it
to
von
shop
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
martin
was
pleased
by
the
wheel
being
delivered
by
a
small
boy
von
schmidt
was
also
inclined
to
be
friendly
was
conclusion
from
this
unusual
favor
repaired
wheels
usually
had
to
be
called
for
but
when
he
examined
the
wheel
he
discovered
no
repairs
had
been
made
a
little
later
in
the
day
he
telephoned
his
betrothed
and
learned
that
that
person
want
anything
to
do
with
him
in
shape
manner
or

martin
answered
cheerfully
a
good
mind
to
come
over
and
punch
that
dutch
nose
of
come
to
my
shop
came
the
reply
send
for
the
police
put
you
through
too
oh
i
know
you
but
you
make

i
want
to

because

philosophy
asserted
itself
dissipating
his
anger
and
he
hung
up
the
receiver
with
a
long
whistle
of
incredulous
amusement
but
after
the
amusement
came
the
reaction
and
he
was
oppressed
by
his
loneliness
nobody
understood
him
nobody
seemed
to
have
any
use
for
him
except
brissenden
and
brissenden
had
disappeared
god
alone
knew
where
twilight
was
falling
as
martin
left
the
fruit
store
and
turned
homeward
his
marketing
on
his
arm
at
the
corner
an
electric
car
had
stopped
and
at
sight
of
a
lean
familiar
figure
alighting
his
heart
leapt
with
joy
it
was
brissenden
and
in
the
fleeting
glimpse
ere
the
car
started
up
martin
noted
the
overcoat
pockets
one
bulging
with
books
the
other
bulging
with
a
quart
bottle
of
whiskey
chapter
xxxv
brissenden
gave
no
explanation
of
his
long
absence
nor
did
martin
pry
into
it
he
was
content
to
see
his
cadaverous
face
opposite
him
through
the
steam
rising
from
a
tumbler
of
toddy
too
have
not
been
idle
brissenden
proclaimed
after
hearing
account
of
the
work
he
had
accomplished
he
pulled
a
manuscript
from
his
inside
coat
pocket
and
passed
it
to
martin
who
looked
at
the
title
and
glanced
up
curiously
it
brissenden
laughed
good
title
eh
is
the
one
word
and
responsible
for
it
what
of
your
who
is
always
the
erected
the
vitalized
inorganic
the
latest
of
the
ephemera
the
creature
of
temperature
strutting
his
little
space
on
the
thermometer
it
got
into
my
head
and
i
had
to
write
it
to
get
rid
of
it
tell
me
what
you
think
of
face
flushed
at
first
paled
as
he
read
on
it
was
perfect
art
form
triumphed
over
substance
if
triumph
it
could
be
called
where
the
last
conceivable
atom
of
substance
had
found
expression
in
so
perfect
construction
as
to
make
head
swim
with
delight
to
put
passionate
tears
into
his
eyes
and
to
send
chills
creeping
up
and
down
his
back
it
was
a
long
poem
of
six
or
seven
hundred
lines
and
it
was
a
fantastic
amazing
unearthly
thing
it
was
terrific
impossible
and
yet
there
it
was
scrawled
in
black
ink
across
the
sheets
of
paper
it
dealt
with
man
and
his
in
their
ultimate
terms
plumbing
the
abysses
of
space
for
the
testimony
of
remotest
suns
and
rainbow
spectrums
it
was
a
mad
orgy
of
imagination
wassailing
in
the
skull
of
a
dying
man
who
half
sobbed
under
his
breath
and
was
quick
with
the
wild
flutter
of
fading
the
poem
swung
in
majestic
rhythm
to
the
cool
tumult
of
interstellar
conflict
to
the
onset
of
starry
hosts
to
the
impact
of
cold
suns
and
the
flaming
up
of
nebulae
in
the
darkened
void
and
through
it
all
unceasing
and
faint
like
a
silver
shuttle
ran
the
frail
piping
voice
of
man
a
querulous
chirp
amid
the
screaming
of
planets
and
the
crash
of
systems
is
nothing
like
it
in
literature
martin
said
when
at
last
he
was
able
to
speak
wonderful
it
has
gone
to
my
head
i
am
drunken
with
it
that
great
infinitesimal
shake
it
out
of
my
thoughts
that
questing
eternal
ever
recurring
thin
little
wailing
voice
of
man
is
still
ringing
in
my
ears
it
is
like
the
of
a
gnat
amid
the
trumpeting
of
elephants
and
the
roaring
of
lions
it
is
insatiable
with
microscopic
desire
i
now
making
a
fool
of
myself
but
the
thing
has
obsessed
me
you
know
what
you
are
wonderful
all
but
how
do
you
do
it
how
do
you
do
it
martin
paused
from
his
rhapsody
only
to
break
out
afresh
shall
never
write
again
i
am
a
dauber
in
clay
you
have
shown
me
the
work
of
the
real
genius
this
is
something
more
than
genius
it
transcends
genius
it
is
truth
gone
mad
it
is
true
man
every
line
of
it
i
wonder
if
you
realize
that
you
dogmatist
science
can
not
give
you
the
lie
it
is
the
truth
of
the
sneer
stamped
out
from
the
black
iron
of
the
cosmos
and
interwoven
with
mighty
rhythms
of
sound
into
a
fabric
of
splendor
and
beauty
and
now
i
say
another
word
i
am
overwhelmed
crushed
yes
i
will
too
let
me
market
it
for
brissenden
grinned
not
a
magazine
in
christendom
that
would
dare
to
publish
know
know
nothing
of
the
sort
i
know
not
a
magazine
in
christendom
that
jump
at
it
they
get
things
like
that
every
day
no
mere
poem
of
the
year
the
poem
of
the
like
to
take
you
up
on
the
get
cynical
martin
exhorted
magazine
editors
are
not
wholly
fatuous
i
know
that
and
close
with
you
on
the
bet
wager
anything
you
want
that
is
accepted
either
on
the
first
or
second
just
one
thing
that
prevents
me
from
taking
brissenden
waited
a
moment
thing
is
biggest
ever
done
i
know
that
my
swan
song
i
am
almighty
proud
of
it
i
worship
it
better
than
whiskey
it
is
what
i
dreamed
great
and
perfect
i
was
a
simple
young
man
with
sweet
illusions
and
clean
ideals
and
got
it
now
in
my
last
grasp
and
not
have
it
pawed
over
and
soiled
by
a
lot
of
swine
no
i
take
the
bet
mine
i
made
it
and
shared
it
with
think
of
the
rest
of
the
world
martin
protested
function
of
beauty
is
my
be
not
brissenden
grinned
soberly
in
the
way
he
had
when
pleased
by
the
thing
his
thin
lips
were
about
to
shape
as
unselfish
as
a
famished
in
vain
martin
strove
to
shake
him
from
his
decision
martin
told
him
that
his
hatred
of
the
magazines
was
rabid
fanatical
and
that
his
conduct
was
a
thousand
times
more
despicable
than
that
of
the
youth
who
burned
the
temple
of
diana
at
ephesus
under
the
storm
of
denunciation
brissenden
complacently
sipped
his
toddy
and
affirmed
that
everything
the
other
said
was
quite
true
with
the
exception
of
the
magazine
editors
his
hatred
of
them
knew
no
bounds
and
he
excelled
martin
in
denunciation
when
he
turned
upon
them
wish
type
it
for
me
he
said
know
how
a
thousand
times
better
than
any
stenographer
and
now
i
want
to
give
you
some
he
drew
a
bulky
manuscript
from
his
outside
coat
pocket
your
of
the
read
it
not
once
but
twice
and
three
highest
compliment
i
can
pay
you
after
what
said
about
i
must
be
silent
but
this
i
will
say
when
shame
of
the
is
published
it
will
make
a
hit
it
will
start
a
controversy
that
will
be
worth
thousands
to
you
just
in
martin
laughed
suppose
your
next
advice
will
be
to
submit
it
to
the
all
means
is
if
you
want
to
see
it
in
print
offer
it
to
the
houses
some
reader
may
be
mad
enough
or
drunk
enough
to
report
favorably
on
it
read
the
books
the
meat
of
them
has
been
transmuted
in
the
alembic
of
martin
mind
and
poured
into
shame
of
the
sun
and
one
day
martin
eden
will
be
famous
and
not
the
least
of
his
fame
will
rest
upon
that
work
so
you
must
get
a
publisher
for
sooner
the
brissenden
went
home
late
that
night
and
just
as
he
mounted
the
first
step
of
the
car
he
swung
suddenly
back
on
martin
and
thrust
into
his
hand
a
small
tightly
crumpled
wad
of
paper
take
this
he
said
was
out
to
the
races
and
i
had
the
right
the
bell
clanged
and
the
car
pulled
out
leaving
martin
wondering
as
to
the
nature
of
the
crinkly
greasy
wad
he
clutched
in
his
hand
back
in
his
room
he
unrolled
it
and
found
a
bill
he
did
not
scruple
to
use
it
he
knew
his
friend
had
always
plenty
of
money
and
he
knew
also
with
profound
certitude
that
his
success
would
enable
him
to
repay
it
in
the
morning
he
paid
every
bill
gave
maria
three
advance
on
the
room
and
redeemed
every
pledge
at
the
pawnshop
next
he
bought
wedding
present
and
simpler
presents
suitable
to
christmas
for
ruth
and
gertrude
and
finally
on
the
balance
remaining
to
him
he
herded
the
whole
silva
tribe
down
into
oakland
he
was
a
winter
late
in
redeeming
his
promise
but
redeemed
it
was
for
the
last
least
silva
got
a
pair
of
shoes
as
well
as
maria
herself
also
there
were
horns
and
dolls
and
toys
of
various
sorts
and
parcels
and
bundles
of
candies
and
nuts
that
filled
the
arms
of
all
the
silvas
to
overflowing
it
was
with
this
extraordinary
procession
trooping
at
his
and
heels
into
a
in
quest
of
the
biggest
ever
made
that
he
encountered
ruth
and
her
mother
morse
was
shocked
even
ruth
was
hurt
for
she
had
some
regard
for
appearances
and
her
lover
cheek
by
jowl
with
maria
at
the
head
of
that
army
of
portuguese
ragamuffins
was
not
a
pretty
sight
but
it
was
not
that
which
hurt
so
much
as
what
she
took
to
be
his
lack
of
pride
and
further
and
keenest
of
all
she
read
into
the
incident
the
impossibility
of
his
living
down
his
origin
there
was
stigma
enough
in
the
fact
of
it
but
shamelessly
to
flaunt
it
in
the
face
of
the
going
too
far
though
her
engagement
to
martin
had
been
kept
secret
their
long
intimacy
had
not
been
unproductive
of
gossip
and
in
the
shop
glancing
covertly
at
her
lover
and
his
following
had
been
several
of
her
acquaintances
she
lacked
the
easy
largeness
of
martin
and
could
not
rise
superior
to
her
environment
she
had
been
hurt
to
the
quick
and
her
sensitive
nature
was
quivering
with
the
shame
of
it
so
it
was
when
martin
arrived
later
in
the
day
that
he
kept
her
present
in
his
deferring
the
giving
of
it
to
a
more
propitious
occasion
ruth
in
angry
a
revelation
to
him
the
spectacle
of
her
suffering
convinced
him
that
he
had
been
a
brute
yet
in
the
soul
of
him
he
could
not
see
how
nor
why
it
never
entered
his
head
to
be
ashamed
of
those
he
knew
and
to
take
the
silvas
out
to
a
christmas
treat
could
in
no
way
so
it
seemed
to
him
show
lack
of
consideration
for
ruth
on
the
other
hand
he
did
see
point
of
view
after
she
had
explained
it
and
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
feminine
weakness
such
as
afflicted
all
women
and
the
best
of
women
chapter
xxxvi
on
show
you
the
real
dirt
brissenden
said
to
him
one
evening
in
january
they
had
dined
together
in
san
francisco
and
were
at
the
ferry
building
returning
to
oakland
when
the
whim
came
to
him
to
show
martin
the
he
turned
and
fled
across
the
a
meagre
shadow
in
a
flapping
overcoat
with
martin
straining
to
keep
up
with
him
at
a
wholesale
liquor
store
he
bought
two
of
old
port
and
with
one
in
each
hand
boarded
a
mission
street
car
martin
at
his
heels
burdened
with
several
of
whiskey
if
ruth
could
see
me
now
was
his
thought
while
he
wondered
as
to
what
constituted
the
real
dirt
nobody
will
be
there
brissenden
said
when
they
dismounted
and
plunged
off
to
the
right
into
the
heart
of
the
ghetto
south
of
market
street
which
case
miss
what
been
looking
for
so
what
the
deuce
is
that
martin
asked
intelligent
men
and
not
the
gibbering
nonentities
i
found
you
consorting
with
in
that
den
you
read
the
books
and
you
found
yourself
all
alone
well
going
to
show
you
some
other
men
read
the
books
so
that
you
be
lonely
any
that
i
bother
my
head
about
their
everlasting
discussions
he
said
at
the
end
of
a
block
not
interested
in
book
philosophy
but
find
these
fellows
intelligences
and
not
bourgeois
swine
but
watch
out
talk
an
arm
off
of
you
on
any
subject
under
the
there
he
panted
a
little
later
resisting
effort
to
relieve
him
of
the
two
demijohns
an
harvard
man
prodigious
memory
idealism
led
him
to
philosophic
anarchy
and
his
family
threw
him
off
a
railroad
president
and
many
times
millionnaire
but
the
starving
in
editing
an
anarchist
sheet
for
a
martin
was
little
acquainted
in
san
francisco
and
not
at
all
south
of
market
so
he
had
no
idea
of
where
he
was
being
led
ahead
he
said
me
about
them
beforehand
what
do
they
do
for
a
living
how
do
they
happen
to
be
here
brissenden
paused
and
rested
his
hands
his
you
of
old
southern
stock
a
man
i
ever
knew
though
clerking
or
trying
to
in
a
socialist
coöperative
store
for
six
dollars
a
week
but
a
confirmed
hobo
tramped
into
town
seen
him
sit
all
day
on
a
bench
and
never
a
bite
pass
his
lips
and
in
the
evening
when
i
invited
him
to
two
blocks
him
say
much
trouble
old
man
buy
me
a
package
of
cigarettes
he
was
a
spencerian
like
you
till
kreis
turned
him
to
materialistic
monism
start
him
on
monism
if
i
can
another
he
affirms
naught
but
spirit
he
can
give
kreis
and
hamilton
all
they
want
is
kreis
martin
asked
rooms
going
to
one
time
from
story
a
mind
like
a
steel
trap
makes
his
living
any
old
way
i
know
been
a
street
fakir
when
he
was
down
unscrupulous
rob
a
corpse
of
a
difference
between
him
and
the
bourgeoisie
is
that
he
robs
without
illusion
talk
nietzsche
or
schopenhauer
or
kant
or
anything
but
the
only
thing
in
this
world
not
excepting
mary
that
he
really
cares
for
is
his
monism
haeckel
is
his
little
tin
god
the
only
way
to
insult
him
is
to
take
a
slap
at
the
brissenden
rested
his
demijohn
at
the
upstairs
entrance
preliminary
to
the
climb
it
was
the
usual
corner
building
with
a
saloon
and
grocery
underneath
gang
lives
the
whole
upstairs
to
themselves
but
kreis
is
the
only
one
who
has
two
rooms
come
no
lights
burned
in
the
upper
hall
but
brissenden
threaded
the
utter
blackness
like
a
familiar
ghost
he
stopped
to
speak
to
martin
one
theosophist
makes
a
pretty
tangle
when
he
gets
going
just
now
in
a
restaurant
likes
a
good
cigar
seen
him
eat
in
a
and
pay
fifty
cents
for
the
cigar
he
smoked
afterward
got
a
couple
in
my
pocket
for
him
if
he
shows
another
australian
a
statistician
and
a
sporting
encyclopaedia
ask
him
the
grain
output
of
paraguay
for
or
the
english
importation
of

for

at
what
weight
jimmy
britt
fought
battling
nelson
or
who
was
champion
of

in
and
get
the
correct
answer
with
the
automatic
celerity
of
a
and
andy
a
has
ideas
on
everything
a
good
and
another
fellow
harry
a
baker
red
hot
socialist
and
strong
union
man
by
the
way
you
remember
and
was
the
chap
who
organized
that
union
and
precipitated
the
it
all
out
in
advance
right
here
in
rooms
did
it
just
for
the
fun
of
it
but
was
too
lazy
to
stay
by
the
union
yet
he
could
have
risen
high
if
he
wanted
to
no
end
to
the
possibilities
in
that
he
so
insuperably
brissenden
advanced
through
the
darkness
till
a
thread
of
light
marked
the
threshold
of
a
door
a
knock
and
an
answer
opened
it
and
martin
found
himself
shaking
hands
with
kreis
a
handsome
brunette
man
with
dazzling
white
teeth
a
drooping
black
mustache
and
large
flashing
black
eyes
mary
a
matronly
young
blonde
was
washing
dishes
in
the
little
back
room
that
served
for
kitchen
and
dining
room
the
front
room
served
as
bedchamber
and
living
room
overhead
was
the
washing
hanging
in
festoons
so
low
that
martin
did
not
see
at
first
the
two
men
talking
in
a
corner
they
hailed
brissenden
and
his
demijohns
with
acclamation
and
on
being
introduced
martin
learned
they
were
andy
and
parry
he
joined
them
and
listened
attentively
to
the
description
of
a
parry
had
seen
the
night
before
while
brissenden
in
his
glory
plunged
into
the
manufacture
of
a
toddy
and
the
serving
of
wine
and
at
his
command
in
the
clan
andy
departed
to
go
the
round
of
the
rooms
for
the
lodgers
lucky
that
most
of
them
are
here
brissenden
whispered
to
martin
norton
and
hamilton
come
on
and
meet
them
stevens
around
i
hear
going
to
get
them
started
on
monism
if
i
can
wait
till
they
get
a
few
jolts
in
them
and
warm
at
first
the
conversation
was
desultory
nevertheless
martin
could
not
fail
to
appreciate
the
keen
play
of
their
minds
they
were
men
with
opinions
though
the
opinions
often
clashed
and
though
they
were
witty
and
clever
they
were
not
superficial
he
swiftly
saw
no
matter
upon
what
they
talked
that
each
man
applied
the
correlation
of
knowledge
and
had
also
a
and
unified
conception
of
society
and
the
cosmos
nobody
manufactured
their
opinions
for
them
they
were
all
rebels
of
one
variety
or
another
and
their
lips
were
strangers
to
platitudes
never
had
martin
at
the
heard
so
amazing
a
range
of
topics
discussed
there
seemed
no
limit
save
time
to
the
things
they
were
alive
to
the
talk
wandered
from
humphry
new
book
to
latest
play
through
the
future
of
the
drama
to
reminiscences
of
mansfield
they
appreciated
or
sneered
at
the
morning
editorials
jumped
from
labor
conditions
in
new
zealand
to
henry
james
and
brander
matthews
passed
on
to
the
german
designs
in
the
far
east
and
the
economic
aspect
of
the
yellow
peril
wrangled
over
the
german
elections
and
last
speech
and
settled
down
to
local
politics
the
latest
plans
and
scandals
in
the
union
labor
party
administration
and
the
wires
that
were
pulled
to
bring
about
the
coast
strike
martin
was
struck
by
the
inside
knowledge
they
possessed
they
knew
what
was
never
printed
in
the
wires
and
strings
and
the
hidden
hands
that
made
the
puppets
dance
to
surprise
the
girl
mary
joined
in
the
conversation
displaying
an
intelligence
he
had
never
encountered
in
the
few
women
he
had
met
they
talked
together
on
swinburne
and
rossetti
after
which
she
led
him
beyond
his
depth
into
the
of
french
literature
his
revenge
came
when
she
defended
maeterlinck
and
he
brought
into
action
the
thesis
of
shame
of
the
several
other
men
had
dropped
in
and
the
air
was
thick
with
tobacco
smoke
when
brissenden
waved
the
red
flag
fresh
meat
for
your
axe
kreis
he
said
youth
with
the
ardor
of
a
lover
for
herbert
spencer
make
a
haeckelite
of
you
kreis
seemed
to
wake
up
and
flash
like
some
metallic
magnetic
thing
while
norton
looked
at
martin
sympathetically
with
a
sweet
girlish
smile
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
would
be
amply
protected
kreis
began
directly
on
martin
but
step
by
step
norton
interfered
until
he
and
kreis
were
off
and
away
in
a
personal
battle
martin
listened
and
fain
would
have
rubbed
his
eyes
it
was
impossible
that
this
should
be
much
less
in
the
labor
ghetto
south
of
market
the
books
were
alive
in
these
men
they
talked
with
fire
and
enthusiasm
the
intellectual
stimulant
stirring
them
as
he
had
seen
drink
and
anger
stir
other
men
what
he
heard
was
no
longer
the
philosophy
of
the
dry
printed
word
written
by
demigods
like
kant
and
spencer
it
was
living
philosophy
with
warm
red
blood
incarnated
in
these
two
men
till
its
very
features
worked
with
excitement
now
and
again
other
men
joined
in
and
all
followed
the
discussion
with
cigarettes
going
out
in
their
hands
and
with
alert
intent
faces
idealism
had
never
attracted
martin
but
the
exposition
it
now
received
at
the
hands
of
norton
was
a
revelation
the
logical
plausibility
of
it
that
made
an
appeal
to
his
intellect
seemed
missed
by
kreis
and
hamilton
who
sneered
at
norton
as
a
metaphysician
and
who
in
turn
sneered
back
at
them
as
metaphysicians
and
were
bandied
back
and
forth
they
charged
him
with
attempting
to
explain
consciousness
by
itself
he
charged
them
with
with
reasoning
from
words
to
theory
instead
of
from
facts
to
theory
at
this
they
were
aghast
it
was
the
cardinal
tenet
of
their
mode
of
reasoning
to
start
with
facts
and
to
give
names
to
the
facts
when
norton
wandered
into
the
intricacies
of
kant
kreis
reminded
him
that
all
good
little
german
philosophies
when
they
died
went
to
oxford
a
little
later
norton
reminded
them
of
law
of
parsimony
the
application
of
which
they
immediately
claimed
for
every
reasoning
process
of
theirs
and
martin
hugged
his
knees
and
exulted
in
it
all
but
norton
was
no
spencerian
and
he
too
strove
for
philosophic
soul
talking
as
much
at
him
as
to
his
two
opponents
know
berkeley
has
never
been
answered
he
said
looking
directly
at
martin
spencer
came
the
nearest
which
was
not
very
near
even
the
stanchest
of
followers
will
not
go
farther
i
was
reading
an
essay
of
the
other
day
and
the
best
saleeby
could
say
was
that
herbert
spencer
succeeded
in
answering
know
what
hume
said
hamilton
asked
norton
nodded
but
hamilton
gave
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
rest
said
that
arguments
admit
of
no
answer
and
produce
no
his
mind
was
the
reply
mind
was
the
same
as
yours
with
this
difference
he
was
wise
enough
to
admit
there
was
no
answering
norton
was
sensitive
and
excitable
though
he
never
lost
his
head
while
kreis
and
hamilton
were
like
a
pair
of
savages
seeking
out
tender
places
to
prod
and
poke
as
the
evening
grew
late
norton
smarting
under
the
repeated
charges
of
being
a
metaphysician
clutching
his
chair
to
keep
from
jumping
to
his
feet
his
gray
eyes
snapping
and
his
girlish
face
grown
harsh
and
sure
made
a
grand
attack
upon
their
position
right
you
haeckelites
i
may
reason
like
a
medicine
man
but
pray
how
do
you
reason
you
have
nothing
to
stand
on
you
unscientific
dogmatists
with
your
positive
science
which
you
are
always
lugging
about
into
places
it
has
no
right
to
be
long
before
the
school
of
materialistic
monism
arose
the
ground
was
removed
so
that
there
could
be
no
foundation
locke
was
the
man
john
locke
two
hundred
years
than
that
even
in
his
concerning
the
human
understanding
he
proved
the
of
innate
ideas
the
best
of
it
is
that
that
is
precisely
what
you
claim
again
and
again
you
have
asserted
the
of
innate
ideas
what
does
that
mean
it
means
that
you
can
never
know
ultimate
reality
your
brains
are
empty
when
you
are
born
appearances
or
phenomena
are
all
the
content
your
minds
can
receive
from
your
five
senses
then
noumena
which
are
not
in
your
minds
when
you
are
born
have
no
way
of
getting
kreis
started
to
interrupt
wait
till
done
norton
shouted
can
know
only
that
much
of
the
play
and
interplay
of
force
and
matter
as
impinges
in
one
way
or
another
on
our
senses
you
see
i
am
willing
to
admit
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
that
matter
exists
and
what
i
am
about
to
do
is
to
efface
you
by
your
own
argument
i
do
it
any
other
way
for
you
are
both
congenitally
unable
to
understand
a
philosophic
abstraction
now
what
do
you
know
of
matter
according
to
your
own
positive
science
you
know
it
only
by
its
phenomena
its
appearances
you
are
aware
only
of
its
changes
or
of
such
changes
in
it
as
cause
changes
in
your
consciousness
positive
science
deals
only
with
phenomena
yet
you
are
foolish
enough
to
strive
to
be
ontologists
and
to
deal
with
noumena
yet
by
the
very
definition
of
positive
science
science
is
concerned
only
with
appearances
as
somebody
has
said
phenomenal
knowledge
can
not
transcend
phenomena
can
not
answer
berkeley
even
if
you
have
annihilated
kant
and
yet
perforce
you
assume
that
berkeley
is
wrong
when
you
affirm
that
science
proves
the
of
god
or
as
much
to
the
point
the
existence
of
know
i
granted
the
reality
of
matter
only
in
order
to
make
myself
intelligible
to
your
understanding
be
positive
scientists
if
you
please
but
ontology
has
no
place
in
positive
science
so
leave
it
alone
spencer
is
right
in
his
agnosticism
but
if
but
it
was
time
to
catch
the
last
for
oakland
and
brissenden
and
martin
slipped
out
leaving
norton
still
talking
and
kreis
and
hamilton
waiting
to
pounce
on
him
like
a
pair
of
hounds
as
soon
as
he
finished
have
given
me
a
glimpse
of
fairyland
martin
said
on
the
makes
life
worth
while
to
meet
people
like
that
my
mind
is
all
worked
up
i
never
appreciated
idealism
before
yet
i
accept
it
i
know
that
i
shall
always
be
a
realist
i
am
so
made
i
guess
but
like
to
have
made
a
reply
to
kreis
and
hamilton
and
i
think
have
had
a
word
or
two
for
norton
i
see
that
spencer
was
damaged
any
as
excited
as
a
child
on
its
first
visit
to
the
circus
i
see
i
must
read
up
some
more
going
to
get
hold
of
saleeby
i
still
think
spencer
is
unassailable
and
next
time
going
to
take
a
hand
but
brissenden
breathing
painfully
had
dropped
off
to
sleep
his
chin
buried
in
a
scarf
and
resting
on
his
sunken
chest
his
body
wrapped
in
the
long
overcoat
and
shaking
to
the
vibration
of
the
propellers
chapter
xxxvii
the
first
thing
martin
did
next
morning
was
to
go
counter
both
to
advice
and
command
shame
of
the
he
wrapped
and
mailed
to
he
believed
he
could
find
magazine
publication
for
it
and
he
felt
that
recognition
by
the
magazines
would
commend
him
to
the
houses
he
likewise
wrapped
and
mailed
to
a
magazine
despite
prejudice
against
the
magazines
which
was
a
pronounced
mania
with
him
martin
decided
that
the
great
poem
should
see
print
he
did
not
intend
however
to
publish
it
without
the
permission
his
plan
was
to
get
it
accepted
by
one
of
the
high
magazines
and
thus
armed
again
to
wrestle
with
brissenden
for
consent
martin
began
that
morning
a
story
which
he
had
sketched
out
a
number
of
weeks
before
and
which
ever
since
had
been
worrying
him
with
its
insistent
clamor
to
be
created
apparently
it
was
to
be
a
rattling
sea
story
a
tale
of
adventure
and
romance
handling
real
characters
in
a
real
world
under
real
conditions
but
beneath
the
swing
and
go
of
the
story
was
to
be
something
that
the
superficial
reader
would
never
discern
and
which
on
the
other
hand
would
not
diminish
in
any
way
the
interest
and
enjoyment
for
such
a
reader
it
was
this
and
not
the
mere
story
that
impelled
martin
to
write
it
for
that
matter
it
was
always
the
great
universal
motif
that
suggested
plots
to
him
after
having
found
such
a
motif
he
cast
about
for
the
particular
persons
and
particular
location
in
time
and
space
wherewith
and
wherein
to
utter
the
universal
thing
was
the
title
he
had
decided
for
it
and
its
length
he
believed
would
not
be
more
than
sixty
thousand
bagatelle
for
him
with
his
splendid
vigor
of
production
on
this
first
day
he
took
hold
of
it
with
conscious
delight
in
the
mastery
of
his
tools
he
no
longer
worried
for
fear
that
the
sharp
cutting
edges
should
slip
and
mar
his
work
the
long
months
of
intense
application
and
study
had
brought
their
reward
he
could
now
devote
himself
with
sure
hand
to
the
larger
phases
of
the
thing
he
shaped
and
as
he
worked
hour
after
hour
he
felt
as
never
before
the
sure
and
cosmic
grasp
with
which
he
held
life
and
the
affairs
of
life
would
tell
a
story
that
would
be
true
of
its
particular
characters
and
its
particular
events
but
it
would
tell
too
he
was
confident
great
vital
things
that
would
be
true
of
all
time
and
all
sea
and
all
to
herbert
spencer
he
thought
leaning
back
for
a
moment
from
the
table
ay
thanks
to
herbert
spencer
and
to
the
of
life
evolution
which
spencer
had
placed
in
his
hands
he
was
conscious
that
it
was
great
stuff
he
was
writing
will
go
it
will
go
was
the
refrain
that
kept
sounding
in
his
ears
of
course
it
would
go
at
last
he
was
turning
out
the
thing
at
which
the
magazines
would
jump
the
whole
story
worked
out
before
him
in
lightning
flashes
he
broke
off
from
it
long
enough
to
write
a
paragraph
in
his
this
would
be
the
last
paragraph
in
but
so
thoroughly
was
the
whole
book
already
composed
in
his
brain
that
he
could
write
weeks
before
he
had
arrived
at
the
end
the
end
itself
he
compared
the
tale
as
yet
unwritten
with
the
tales
of
the
and
he
felt
it
to
be
immeasurably
superior
only
one
man
who
could
touch
it
he
murmured
aloud
conrad
and
it
ought
to
make
even
him
sit
up
and
shake
hands
with
me
and
say
done
martin
my
he
toiled
on
all
day
recollecting
at
the
last
moment
that
he
was
to
have
dinner
at
the
thanks
to
brissenden
his
black
suit
was
out
of
pawn
and
he
was
again
eligible
for
dinner
parties
down
town
he
stopped
off
long
enough
to
run
into
the
library
and
search
for
books
he
drew
out
cycle
of
life
and
on
the
car
turned
to
the
essay
norton
had
mentioned
on
spencer
as
martin
read
he
grew
angry
his
face
flushed
his
jaw
set
and
unconsciously
his
hand
clenched
unclenched
and
clenched
again
as
if
he
were
taking
fresh
grips
upon
some
hateful
thing
out
of
which
he
was
squeezing
the
life
when
he
left
the
car
he
strode
along
the
sidewalk
as
a
wrathful
man
will
stride
and
he
rang
the
morse
bell
with
such
viciousness
that
it
roused
him
to
consciousness
of
his
condition
so
that
he
entered
in
good
nature
smiling
with
amusement
at
himself
no
sooner
however
was
he
inside
than
a
great
depression
descended
upon
him
he
fell
from
the
height
where
he
had
been
all
day
on
the
wings
of
inspiration
epithets
repeated
themselves
in
his
mind
but
what
of
that
he
demanded
angrily
he
was
marrying
ruth
not
her
family
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
seen
ruth
more
beautiful
more
spiritual
and
ethereal
and
at
the
same
time
more
healthy
there
was
color
in
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
drew
him
again
and
eyes
in
which
he
had
first
read
immortality
he
had
forgotten
immortality
of
late
and
the
trend
of
his
scientific
reading
had
been
away
from
it
but
here
in
eyes
he
read
an
argument
without
words
that
transcended
all
worded
arguments
he
saw
that
in
her
eyes
before
which
all
discussion
fled
away
for
he
saw
love
there
and
in
his
own
eyes
was
love
and
love
was
unanswerable
such
was
his
passionate
doctrine
the
half
hour
he
had
with
her
before
they
went
in
to
dinner
left
him
supremely
happy
and
supremely
satisfied
with
life
nevertheless
at
table
the
inevitable
reaction
and
exhaustion
consequent
upon
the
hard
day
seized
hold
of
him
he
was
aware
that
his
eyes
were
tired
and
that
he
was
irritable
he
remembered
it
was
at
this
table
at
which
he
now
sneered
and
was
so
often
bored
that
he
had
first
eaten
with
civilized
beings
in
what
he
had
imagined
was
an
atmosphere
of
high
culture
and
refinement
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
that
pathetic
figure
of
him
so
long
ago
a
savage
sprouting
sweat
at
every
pore
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
puzzled
by
the
bewildering
minutiae
of
tortured
by
the
ogre
of
a
servant
striving
at
a
leap
to
live
at
such
dizzy
social
altitude
and
deciding
in
the
end
to
be
frankly
himself
pretending
no
knowledge
and
no
polish
he
did
not
possess
he
glanced
at
ruth
for
reassurance
much
in
the
same
manner
that
a
passenger
with
sudden
panic
thought
of
possible
shipwreck
will
strive
to
locate
the
life
preservers
well
that
much
had
come
out
of
and
ruth
all
the
rest
had
failed
to
stand
the
test
of
the
books
but
ruth
and
love
had
stood
the
test
for
them
he
found
a
biological
sanction
love
was
the
most
exalted
expression
of
life
nature
had
been
busy
designing
him
as
she
had
been
busy
with
all
normal
men
for
the
purpose
of
loving
she
had
spent
ten
thousand
a
hundred
thousand
and
a
million
the
task
and
he
was
the
best
she
could
do
she
had
made
love
the
strongest
thing
in
him
increased
its
power
a
myriad
per
cent
with
her
gift
of
imagination
and
sent
him
forth
into
the
ephemera
to
thrill
and
melt
and
mate
his
hand
sought
hand
beside
him
hidden
by
the
table
and
a
warm
pressure
was
given
and
received
she
looked
at
him
a
swift
instant
and
her
eyes
were
radiant
and
melting
so
were
his
in
the
thrill
that
pervaded
him
nor
did
he
realize
how
much
that
was
radiant
and
melting
in
her
eyes
had
been
aroused
by
what
she
had
seen
in
his
across
the
table
from
him
at
right
sat
judge
blount
a
local
superior
court
judge
martin
had
met
him
a
number
of
times
and
had
failed
to
like
him
he
and
father
were
discussing
labor
union
politics
the
local
situation
and
socialism
and
morse
was
endeavoring
to
twit
martin
on
the
latter
topic
at
last
judge
blount
looked
across
the
table
with
benignant
and
fatherly
pity
martin
smiled
to
himself
grow
out
of
it
young
man
he
said
soothingly
is
the
best
cure
for
such
youthful
he
turned
to
morse
do
not
believe
discussion
is
good
in
such
cases
it
makes
the
patient
is
true
the
other
assented
gravely
it
is
well
to
warn
the
patient
occasionally
of
his
martin
laughed
merrily
but
it
was
with
an
effort
the
day
had
been
too
long
the
effort
too
intense
and
he
was
deep
in
the
throes
of
the
reaction
you
are
both
excellent
doctors
he
said
if
you
care
a
whit
for
the
opinion
of
the
patient
let
him
tell
you
that
you
are
poor
diagnosticians
in
fact
you
are
both
suffering
from
the
disease
you
think
you
find
in
me
as
for
me
i
am
immune
the
socialist
philosophy
that
riots
in
your
veins
has
passed
me
clever
murmured
the
judge
excellent
ruse
in
controversy
to
reverse
of
your
eyes
were
sparkling
but
he
kept
control
of
himself
see
judge
heard
your
campaign
speeches
by
some
henidical
by
the
way
is
a
favorite
word
of
mine
which
nobody
some
henidical
process
you
persuade
yourself
that
you
believe
in
the
competitive
system
and
the
survival
of
the
strong
and
at
the
same
time
you
indorse
with
might
and
main
all
sorts
of
measures
to
shear
the
strength
from
the
young
heard
your
campaign
speeches
martin
warned
on
record
your
position
on
interstate
commerce
regulation
on
regulation
of
the
railway
trust
and
standard
oil
on
the
conservation
of
the
forests
on
a
thousand
and
one
restrictive
measures
that
are
nothing
else
than
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
do
not
believe
in
regulating
these
various
outrageous
exercises
of
power
not
the
point
i
mean
to
tell
you
that
you
are
a
poor
diagnostician
i
mean
to
tell
you
that
i
am
not
suffering
from
the
microbe
of
socialism
i
mean
to
tell
you
that
it
is
you
who
are
suffering
from
the
emasculating
ravages
of
that
same
microbe
as
for
me
i
am
an
inveterate
opponent
of
socialism
just
as
i
am
an
inveterate
opponent
of
your
own
mongrel
democracy
that
is
nothing
else
than
masquerading
under
a
garb
of
words
that
will
not
stand
the
test
of
the
am
a
complete
a
reactionary
that
my
position
is
incomprehensible
to
you
who
live
in
a
veiled
lie
of
social
organization
and
whose
sight
is
not
keen
enough
to
pierce
the
veil
you
make
believe
that
you
believe
in
the
survival
of
the
strong
and
the
rule
of
the
strong
i
believe
that
is
the
difference
when
i
was
a
trifle
younger
few
months
younger
believed
the
same
thing
you
see
the
ideas
of
you
and
yours
had
impressed
me
but
merchants
and
traders
are
cowardly
rulers
at
best
they
grunt
and
grub
all
their
days
in
the
trough
of
and
i
have
swung
back
to
aristocracy
if
you
please
i
am
the
only
individualist
in
this
room
i
look
to
the
state
for
nothing
i
look
only
to
the
strong
man
the
man
on
horseback
to
save
the
state
from
its
own
rotten
was
right
i
take
the
time
to
tell
you
who
nietzsche
was
but
he
was
right
the
world
belongs
to
the
the
strong
who
are
noble
as
well
and
who
do
not
wallow
in
the
of
trade
and
exchange
the
world
belongs
to
the
true
nobleman
to
the
great
blond
beasts
to
the
noncompromisers
to
the
and
they
will
eat
you
up
you
are
afraid
of
socialism
and
who
think
yourselves
individualists
your
of
the
meek
and
lowly
will
never
save
all
greek
i
know
and
i
bother
you
any
more
with
it
but
remember
one
thing
there
half
a
dozen
individualists
in
oakland
but
martin
eden
is
one
of
he
signified
that
he
was
done
with
the
discussion
and
turned
to
ruth
wrought
up
he
said
in
an
undertone
i
want
to
do
is
to
love
not
he
ignored
morse
who
said
am
unconvinced
all
socialists
are
jesuits
that
is
the
way
to
tell
make
a
good
republican
out
of
you
yet
said
judge
blount
man
on
horseback
will
arrive
before
that
time
martin
retorted
with
good
humor
and
returned
to
ruth
but
morse
was
not
content
he
did
not
like
the
laziness
and
the
disinclination
for
sober
legitimate
work
of
this
prospective
of
his
for
whose
ideas
he
had
no
respect
and
of
whose
nature
he
had
no
understanding
so
he
turned
the
conversation
to
herbert
spencer
judge
blount
ably
seconded
him
and
martin
whose
ears
had
pricked
at
the
first
mention
of
the
name
listened
to
the
judge
enunciate
a
grave
and
complacent
diatribe
against
spencer
from
time
to
time
morse
glanced
at
martin
as
much
as
to
say
my
boy
you
daws
martin
muttered
under
his
breath
and
went
on
talking
with
ruth
and
arthur
but
the
long
day
and
the
of
the
night
before
were
telling
upon
him
and
besides
still
in
his
burnt
mind
was
what
had
made
him
angry
when
he
read
it
on
the
car
is
the
matter
ruth
asked
suddenly
alarmed
by
the
effort
he
was
making
to
contain
himself
is
no
god
but
the
unknowable
and
herbert
spencer
is
its
prophet
judge
blount
was
saying
at
that
moment
martin
turned
upon
him
cheap
judgment
he
remarked
quietly
heard
it
first
in
the
city
hall
park
on
the
lips
of
a
workingman
who
ought
to
have
known
better
i
have
heard
it
often
since
and
each
time
the
of
it
nauseates
me
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
to
hear
that
great
and
noble
name
upon
your
lips
is
like
finding
a
in
a
cesspool
you
are
it
was
like
a
thunderbolt
judge
blount
glared
at
him
with
apoplectic
countenance
and
silence
reigned
morse
was
secretly
pleased
he
could
see
that
his
daughter
was
shocked
it
was
what
he
wanted
to
bring
out
the
innate
ruffianism
of
this
man
he
did
not
like
hand
sought
beseechingly
under
the
table
but
his
blood
was
up
he
was
inflamed
by
the
intellectual
pretence
and
fraud
of
those
who
sat
in
the
high
places
a
superior
court
judge
it
was
only
several
years
before
that
he
had
looked
up
from
the
mire
at
such
glorious
entities
and
deemed
them
gods
judge
blount
recovered
himself
and
attempted
to
go
on
addressing
himself
to
martin
with
an
assumption
of
politeness
that
the
latter
understood
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
ladies
even
this
added
to
his
anger
was
there
no
honesty
in
the
world
discuss
spencer
with
me
he
cried
do
not
know
any
more
about
spencer
than
do
his
own
countrymen
but
it
is
no
fault
of
yours
i
grant
it
is
just
a
phase
of
the
contemptible
ignorance
of
the
times
i
ran
across
a
sample
of
it
on
my
way
here
this
evening
i
was
reading
an
essay
by
saleeby
on
spencer
you
should
read
it
it
is
accessible
to
all
men
you
can
buy
it
in
any
or
draw
it
from
the
public
library
you
would
feel
ashamed
of
your
paucity
of
abuse
and
ignorance
of
that
noble
man
compared
with
what
saleeby
has
collected
on
the
subject
it
is
a
record
of
shame
that
would
shame
your
shame
philosopher
of
the
he
was
called
by
an
academic
philosopher
who
was
not
worthy
to
pollute
the
atmosphere
he
breathed
i
think
you
have
read
ten
pages
of
spencer
but
there
have
been
critics
assumably
more
intelligent
than
you
who
have
read
no
more
than
you
of
spencer
who
publicly
challenged
his
followers
to
adduce
one
single
idea
from
all
his
herbert
writings
the
man
who
has
impressed
the
stamp
of
his
genius
over
the
whole
field
of
scientific
research
and
modern
thought
the
father
of
psychology
the
man
who
revolutionized
pedagogy
so
that
the
child
of
the
french
peasant
is
taught
the
three
according
to
principles
laid
down
by
him
and
the
little
gnats
of
men
sting
his
memory
when
they
get
their
very
bread
and
butter
from
the
technical
application
of
his
ideas
what
little
of
worth
resides
in
their
brains
is
largely
due
to
him
it
is
certain
that
had
he
never
lived
most
of
what
is
correct
in
their
knowledge
would
be
absent
yet
a
man
like
principal
fairbanks
of
man
who
sits
in
an
even
higher
place
than
you
judge
said
that
spencer
will
be
dismissed
by
posterity
as
a
poet
and
dreamer
rather
than
a
thinker
yappers
and
blatherskites
the
whole
brood
of
them
is
not
wholly
destitute
of
a
certain
literary
power
said
one
of
them
and
others
of
them
have
said
that
he
was
an
industrious
plodder
rather
than
an
original
thinker
yappers
and
blatherskites
yappers
and
blatherskites
martin
ceased
abruptly
in
a
dead
silence
everybody
in
family
looked
up
to
judge
blount
as
a
man
of
power
and
achievement
and
they
were
horrified
at
outbreak
the
remainder
of
the
dinner
passed
like
a
funeral
the
judge
and
morse
confining
their
talk
to
each
other
and
the
rest
of
the
conversation
being
extremely
desultory
then
afterward
when
ruth
and
martin
were
alone
there
was
a
scene
are
unbearable
she
wept
but
his
anger
still
smouldered
and
he
kept
muttering
beasts
the
beasts
when
she
averred
he
had
insulted
the
judge
he
retorted
telling
the
truth
about
him
care
whether
it
was
true
or
not
she
insisted
are
certain
bounds
of
decency
and
you
had
no
license
to
insult
where
did
judge
blount
get
the
license
to
assault
truth
martin
demanded
to
assault
truth
is
a
more
serious
misdemeanor
than
to
insult
a
pygmy
personality
such
as
the
he
did
worse
than
that
he
blackened
the
name
of
a
great
noble
man
who
is
dead
oh
the
beasts
the
beasts
his
complex
anger
flamed
afresh
and
ruth
was
in
terror
of
him
never
had
she
seen
him
so
angry
and
it
was
all
mystified
and
unreasonable
to
her
comprehension
and
yet
through
her
very
terror
ran
the
fibres
of
fascination
that
had
drawn
and
that
still
drew
her
to
had
compelled
her
to
lean
towards
him
and
in
that
mad
culminating
moment
lay
her
hands
upon
his
neck
she
was
hurt
and
outraged
by
what
had
taken
place
and
yet
she
lay
in
his
arms
and
quivered
while
he
went
on
muttering
beasts
the
beasts
and
she
still
lay
there
when
he
said
not
bother
your
table
again
dear
they
do
not
like
me
and
it
is
wrong
of
me
to
thrust
my
objectionable
presence
upon
them
besides
they
are
just
as
objectionable
to
me
faugh
they
are
sickening
and
to
think
of
it
i
dreamed
in
my
innocence
that
the
persons
who
sat
in
the
high
places
who
lived
in
fine
houses
and
had
educations
and
bank
accounts
were
worth
while
chapter
xxxviii
on
go
down
to
the
so
spoke
brissenden
faint
from
a
hemorrhage
of
half
an
hour
second
hemorrhage
in
three
days
the
perennial
whiskey
glass
was
in
his
hands
and
he
drained
it
with
shaking
fingers
do
i
want
with
socialism
martin
demanded
are
allowed
speeches
the
sick
man
urged
up
and
spout
tell
them
why
you
want
socialism
tell
them
what
you
think
about
them
and
their
ghetto
ethics
slam
nietzsche
into
them
and
get
walloped
for
your
pains
make
a
scrap
of
it
it
will
do
them
good
discussion
is
what
they
want
and
what
you
want
too
you
see
like
to
see
you
a
socialist
before
gone
it
will
give
you
a
sanction
for
your
existence
it
is
the
one
thing
that
will
save
you
in
the
time
of
disappointment
that
is
coming
to
never
can
puzzle
out
why
you
of
all
men
are
a
socialist
martin
pondered
detest
the
crowd
so
surely
there
is
nothing
in
the
canaille
to
recommend
it
to
your
aesthetic
he
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
the
whiskey
glass
which
the
other
was
refilling
seem
to
save
very
sick
was
the
answer
you
it
is
different
you
have
health
and
much
to
live
for
and
you
must
be
handcuffed
to
life
somehow
as
for
me
you
wonder
why
i
am
a
socialist
tell
you
it
is
because
socialism
is
inevitable
because
the
present
rotten
and
irrational
system
can
not
endure
because
the
day
is
past
for
your
man
on
horseback
the
slaves
stand
for
it
they
are
too
many
and
drag
down
the
equestrian
before
ever
he
gets
astride
you
get
away
from
them
and
have
to
swallow
the
whole
not
a
nice
mess
allow
but
been
and
swallow
it
you
must
you
are
antediluvian
anyway
with
your
nietzsche
ideas
the
past
is
past
and
the
man
who
says
history
repeats
itself
is
a
liar
of
course
i
like
the
crowd
but
a
poor
chap
to
do
we
have
the
man
on
horseback
and
anything
is
preferable
to
the
timid
swine
that
now
rule
but
come
on
anyway
loaded
to
the
guards
now
and
if
i
sit
here
any
longer
get
drunk
and
you
know
the
doctor
the
doctor
fool
him
it
was
sunday
night
and
they
found
the
small
hall
packed
by
the
oakland
socialists
chiefly
members
of
the
working
class
the
speaker
a
clever
jew
won
admiration
at
the
same
time
that
he
aroused
his
antagonism
the
stooped
and
narrow
shoulders
and
weazened
chest
proclaimed
him
the
true
child
of
the
crowded
ghetto
and
strong
on
martin
was
the
struggle
of
the
feeble
wretched
slaves
against
the
lordly
handful
of
men
who
had
ruled
over
them
and
would
rule
over
them
to
the
end
of
time
to
martin
this
withered
wisp
of
a
creature
was
a
symbol
he
was
the
figure
that
stood
forth
representative
of
the
whole
miserable
mass
of
weaklings
and
inefficients
who
perished
according
to
biological
law
on
the
ragged
confines
of
life
they
were
the
unfit
in
spite
of
their
cunning
philosophy
and
of
their
antlike
proclivities
for
coöperation
nature
rejected
them
for
the
exceptional
man
out
of
the
plentiful
spawn
of
life
she
flung
from
her
prolific
hand
she
selected
only
the
best
it
was
by
the
same
method
that
men
aping
her
bred
and
cucumbers
doubtless
a
creator
of
a
cosmos
could
have
devised
a
better
method
but
creatures
of
this
particular
cosmos
must
put
up
with
this
particular
method
of
course
they
could
squirm
as
they
perished
as
the
socialists
squirmed
as
the
speaker
on
the
platform
and
the
perspiring
crowd
were
squirming
even
now
as
they
counselled
together
for
some
new
device
with
which
to
minimize
the
penalties
of
living
and
outwit
the
cosmos
so
martin
thought
and
so
he
spoke
when
brissenden
urged
him
to
give
them
hell
he
obeyed
the
mandate
walking
up
to
the
platform
as
was
the
custom
and
addressing
the
chairman
he
began
in
a
low
voice
haltingly
forming
into
order
the
ideas
which
had
surged
in
his
brain
while
the
jew
was
speaking
in
such
meetings
five
minutes
was
the
time
allotted
to
each
speaker
but
when
five
minutes
were
up
he
was
in
full
stride
his
attack
upon
their
doctrines
but
half
completed
he
had
caught
their
interest
and
the
audience
urged
the
chairman
by
acclamation
to
extend
time
they
appreciated
him
as
a
foeman
worthy
of
their
intellect
and
they
listened
intently
following
every
word
he
spoke
with
fire
and
conviction
mincing
no
words
in
his
attack
upon
the
slaves
and
their
morality
and
tactics
and
frankly
alluding
to
his
hearers
as
the
slaves
in
question
he
quoted
spencer
and
malthus
and
enunciated
the
biological
law
of
development
so
he
concluded
in
a
swift
résumé
state
composed
of
the
can
endure
the
old
law
of
development
still
holds
in
the
struggle
for
existence
as
i
have
shown
the
strong
and
the
progeny
of
the
strong
tend
to
survive
while
the
weak
and
the
progeny
of
the
weak
are
crushed
and
tend
to
perish
the
result
is
that
the
strong
and
the
progeny
of
the
strong
survive
and
so
long
as
the
struggle
obtains
the
strength
of
each
generation
increases
that
is
development
but
you
is
too
bad
to
be
slaves
i
you
slaves
dream
of
a
society
where
the
law
of
development
will
be
annulled
where
no
weaklings
and
inefficients
will
perish
where
every
inefficient
will
have
as
much
as
he
wants
to
eat
as
many
times
a
day
as
he
desires
and
where
all
will
marry
and
have
weak
as
well
as
the
strong
what
will
be
the
result
no
longer
will
the
strength
and
of
each
generation
increase
on
the
contrary
it
will
diminish
there
is
the
nemesis
of
your
slave
philosophy
your
society
of
by
and
for
inevitably
weaken
and
go
to
pieces
as
the
life
which
composes
it
weakens
and
goes
to
pieces
i
am
enunciating
biology
and
not
sentimental
ethics
no
state
of
slaves
can
about
the
united
states
a
man
yelled
from
the
audience
how
about
it
martin
retorted
thirteen
colonies
threw
off
their
rulers
and
formed
the
republic
the
slaves
were
their
own
masters
there
were
no
more
masters
of
the
sword
but
you
get
along
without
masters
of
some
sort
and
there
arose
a
new
set
of
the
great
virile
noble
men
but
the
shrewd
and
spidery
traders
and
and
they
enslaved
you
over
not
frankly
as
the
true
noble
men
would
do
with
weight
of
their
own
right
arms
but
secretly
by
spidery
machinations
and
by
wheedling
and
cajolery
and
lies
they
have
purchased
your
slave
judges
they
have
debauched
your
slave
legislatures
and
they
have
forced
to
worse
horrors
than
chattel
slavery
your
slave
boys
and
girls
two
million
of
your
children
are
toiling
in
this
of
the
united
states
ten
millions
of
you
slaves
are
not
properly
sheltered
nor
properly
fed
to
return
i
have
shown
that
no
society
of
slaves
can
endure
because
in
its
very
nature
such
society
must
annul
the
law
of
development
no
sooner
can
a
slave
society
be
organized
than
deterioration
sets
in
it
is
easy
for
you
to
talk
of
annulling
the
law
of
development
but
where
is
the
new
law
of
development
that
will
maintain
your
strength
formulate
it
is
it
already
formulated
then
state
martin
took
his
seat
amidst
an
uproar
of
voices
a
score
of
men
were
on
their
feet
clamoring
for
recognition
from
the
chair
and
one
by
one
encouraged
by
vociferous
applause
speaking
with
fire
and
enthusiasm
and
excited
gestures
they
replied
to
the
attack
it
was
a
wild
it
was
wild
intellectually
a
battle
of
ideas
some
strayed
from
the
point
but
most
of
the
speakers
replied
directly
to
martin
they
shook
him
with
lines
of
thought
that
were
new
to
him
and
gave
him
insights
not
into
new
biological
laws
but
into
new
applications
of
the
old
laws
they
were
too
earnest
to
be
always
polite
and
more
than
once
the
chairman
rapped
and
pounded
for
order
it
chanced
that
a
cub
reporter
sat
in
the
audience
detailed
there
on
a
day
dull
of
news
and
impressed
by
the
urgent
need
of
journalism
for
sensation
he
was
not
a
bright
cub
reporter
he
was
merely
facile
and
glib
he
was
too
dense
to
follow
the
discussion
in
fact
he
had
a
comfortable
feeling
that
he
was
vastly
superior
to
these
wordy
maniacs
of
the
working
class
also
he
had
a
great
respect
for
those
who
sat
in
the
high
places
and
dictated
the
policies
of
nations
and
newspapers
further
he
had
an
ideal
namely
of
achieving
that
excellence
of
the
perfect
reporter
who
is
able
to
make
a
great
of
nothing
he
did
not
know
what
all
the
talk
was
about
it
was
not
necessary
words
like
gave
him
his
cue
like
a
paleontologist
able
to
reconstruct
an
entire
skeleton
from
one
fossil
bone
he
was
able
to
reconstruct
a
whole
speech
from
the
one
word
he
did
it
that
night
and
he
did
it
well
and
since
martin
had
made
the
biggest
stir
he
put
it
all
into
his
mouth
and
made
him
the
of
the
show
transforming
his
reactionary
individualism
into
the
most
lurid
socialist
utterance
the
cub
reporter
was
an
artist
and
it
was
a
large
brush
with
which
he
laid
on
the
local
men
neurasthenic
and
degenerate
types
of
men
voices
shaken
with
passion
clenched
fists
raised
on
high
and
all
projected
against
a
background
of
oaths
yells
and
the
throaty
rumbling
of
angry
men
chapter
xxxix
over
the
coffee
in
his
little
room
martin
read
next
paper
it
was
a
novel
experience
to
find
himself
on
the
first
page
at
that
and
he
was
surprised
to
learn
that
he
was
the
most
notorious
leader
of
the
oakland
socialists
he
ran
over
the
violent
speech
the
cub
reporter
had
constructed
for
him
and
though
at
first
he
was
angered
by
the
fabrication
in
the
end
he
tossed
the
paper
aside
with
a
laugh
the
man
was
drunk
or
criminally
malicious
he
said
that
afternoon
from
his
perch
on
the
bed
when
brissenden
had
arrived
and
dropped
limply
into
the
one
chair
what
do
you
care
brissenden
asked
you
desire
the
approval
of
the
bourgeois
swine
that
read
the
newspapers
martin
thought
for
a
while
then
said
i
really
care
for
their
approval
not
a
whit
on
the
other
hand
very
likely
to
make
my
relations
with
family
a
trifle
awkward
her
father
always
contended
i
was
a
socialist
and
this
miserable
stuff
will
clinch
his
belief
not
that
i
care
for
his
the
odds
i
want
to
read
you
what
been
doing
of
course
and
just
about
halfway
he
was
reading
aloud
when
maria
thrust
open
the
door
and
ushered
in
a
young
man
in
a
natty
suit
who
glanced
briskly
about
him
noting
the
and
the
kitchen
in
the
corner
before
his
gaze
wandered
on
to
martin
down
brissenden
said
martin
made
room
for
the
young
man
on
the
bed
and
waited
for
him
to
broach
his
business
heard
you
speak
last
night
eden
and
come
to
interview
you
he
began
brissenden
burst
out
in
a
hearty
laugh
brother
socialist
the
reporter
asked
with
a
quick
glance
at
brissenden
that
appraised
the
of
that
cadaverous
and
dying
man
he
wrote
that
report
martin
said
softly
he
is
only
a
boy
you
poke
him
brissenden
asked
give
a
thousand
dollars
to
have
my
lungs
back
for
five
the
cub
reporter
was
a
trifle
perplexed
by
this
talking
over
him
and
around
him
and
at
him
but
he
had
been
commended
for
his
brilliant
description
of
the
socialist
meeting
and
had
further
been
detailed
to
get
a
personal
interview
with
martin
eden
the
leader
of
the
organized
menace
to
society
do
not
object
to
having
your
picture
taken
eden
he
said
a
staff
photographer
outside
you
see
and
he
says
it
will
be
better
to
take
you
right
away
before
the
sun
gets
lower
then
we
can
have
the
interview
photographer
brissenden
said
meditatively
him
martin
poke
him
guess
getting
old
was
the
answer
know
i
ought
but
i
really
the
heart
it
seem
to
his
sake
brissenden
urged
worth
considering
martin
replied
it
seem
worth
while
enough
to
rouse
sufficient
energy
in
me
you
see
it
does
take
energy
to
give
a
fellow
a
poking
besides
what
does
it
matter
the
way
to
take
it
the
cub
announced
airily
though
he
had
already
begun
to
glance
anxiously
at
the
door
it
true
not
a
word
of
what
he
wrote
martin
went
on
confining
his
attention
to
brissenden
was
just
in
a
general
way
a
description
you
understand
the
cub
ventured
besides
good
advertising
what
counts
it
was
a
favor
to
good
advertising
martin
old
boy
brissenden
repeated
solemnly
it
was
a
favor
to
of
that
was
contribution
me
were
you
born
eden
the
cub
asked
assuming
an
air
of
expectant
attention
take
notes
said
brissenden
remembers
it
is
sufficient
for
the
cub
was
trying
not
to
look
worried
decent
reporter
needs
to
bother
with
was
last
but
brissenden
was
not
a
disciple
of
quietism
and
he
changed
his
attitude
abruptly
if
you
poke
him
do
it
myself
if
i
fall
dead
on
the
floor
the
next
will
a
spanking
do
martin
asked
brissenden
considered
judicially
and
nodded
his
head
the
next
instant
martin
was
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
with
the
cub
face
downward
across
his
knees
bite
martin
warned
else
have
to
punch
your
face
it
would
be
a
pity
for
it
is
such
a
pretty
his
uplifted
hand
descended
and
thereafter
rose
and
fell
in
a
swift
and
steady
rhythm
the
cub
struggled
and
cursed
and
squirmed
but
did
not
offer
to
bite
brissenden
looked
on
gravely
though
once
he
grew
excited
and
gripped
the
whiskey
bottle
pleading
just
let
me
swat
him
my
hand
played
out
martin
said
when
at
last
he
desisted
is
quite
he
uprighted
the
cub
and
perched
him
on
the
bed
have
you
arrested
for
this
he
snarled
tears
of
boyish
indignation
running
down
his
flushed
cheeks
make
you
sweat
for
this
pretty
thing
martin
remarked
realize
that
he
has
entered
upon
the
downward
path
it
is
not
honest
it
is
not
square
it
is
not
manly
to
tell
lies
about
the
way
he
has
done
and
he
know
has
to
come
to
us
to
be
told
brissenden
filled
in
a
pause
to
me
whom
he
has
maligned
and
injured
my
grocery
will
undoubtedly
refuse
me
credit
now
the
worst
of
it
is
that
the
poor
boy
will
keep
on
this
way
until
he
deteriorates
into
a
newspaper
man
and
also
a
there
is
yet
time
quoth
brissenden
knows
but
what
you
may
prove
the
humble
instrument
to
save
him
why
you
let
me
swat
him
just
once
like
to
have
had
a
hand
in
have
you
arrested
the
pair
of
you
you
brutes
sobbed
the
erring
soul
his
mouth
is
too
pretty
and
too
martin
shook
his
head
lugubriously
afraid
numbed
my
hand
in
vain
the
young
man
can
not
reform
he
will
become
eventually
a
very
great
and
successful
newspaper
man
he
has
no
conscience
that
alone
will
make
him
with
that
the
cub
passed
out
the
door
in
trepidation
to
the
last
for
fear
that
brissenden
would
hit
him
in
the
back
with
the
bottle
he
still
clutched
in
the
next
paper
martin
learned
a
great
deal
more
about
himself
that
was
new
to
him
are
the
sworn
enemies
of
society
he
found
himself
quoted
as
saying
in
a
column
interview
we
are
not
anarchists
but
when
the
reporter
pointed
out
to
him
that
there
seemed
little
difference
between
the
two
schools
martin
had
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
silent
affirmation
his
face
was
described
as
bilaterally
asymmetrical
and
various
other
signs
of
degeneration
were
described
especially
notable
were
his
thuglike
hands
and
the
fiery
gleams
in
his
eyes
he
learned
also
that
he
spoke
nightly
to
the
workmen
in
the
city
hall
park
and
that
among
the
anarchists
and
agitators
that
there
inflamed
the
minds
of
the
people
he
drew
the
largest
audiences
and
made
the
most
revolutionary
speeches
the
cub
painted
a
picture
of
his
poor
little
room
its
and
the
one
chair
and
of
the
tramp
who
kept
him
company
and
who
looked
as
if
he
had
just
emerged
from
twenty
years
of
solitary
confinement
in
some
fortress
dungeon
the
cub
had
been
industrious
he
had
scurried
around
and
nosed
out
family
history
and
procured
a
photograph
of
cash
store
with
bernard
higginbotham
himself
standing
out
in
front
that
gentleman
was
depicted
as
an
intelligent
dignified
businessman
who
had
no
patience
with
his
socialistic
views
and
no
patience
with
the
either
whom
he
was
quoted
as
characterizing
as
a
lazy
who
take
a
job
when
it
was
offered
to
him
and
who
would
go
to
jail
yet
hermann
von
schmidt
husband
had
likewise
been
interviewed
he
had
called
martin
the
black
sheep
of
the
family
and
repudiated
him
tried
to
sponge
off
of
me
but
i
put
a
stop
to
that
good
and
quick
von
schmidt
had
said
to
the
reporter
knows
better
than
to
come
bumming
around
here
a
man
who
work
is
no
good
take
that
from
this
time
martin
was
genuinely
angry
brissenden
looked
upon
the
affair
as
a
good
joke
but
he
could
not
console
martin
who
knew
that
it
would
be
no
easy
task
to
explain
to
ruth
as
for
her
father
he
knew
that
he
must
be
overjoyed
with
what
had
happened
and
that
he
would
make
the
most
of
it
to
break
off
the
engagement
how
much
he
would
make
of
it
he
was
soon
to
realize
the
afternoon
mail
brought
a
letter
from
ruth
martin
opened
it
with
a
premonition
of
disaster
and
read
it
standing
at
the
open
door
when
he
had
received
it
from
the
postman
as
he
read
mechanically
his
hand
sought
his
pocket
for
the
tobacco
and
brown
paper
of
his
old
cigarette
days
he
was
not
aware
that
the
pocket
was
empty
or
that
he
had
even
reached
for
the
materials
with
which
to
roll
a
cigarette
it
was
not
a
passionate
letter
there
were
no
touches
of
anger
in
it
but
all
the
way
through
from
the
first
sentence
to
the
last
was
sounded
the
note
of
hurt
and
disappointment
she
had
expected
better
of
him
she
had
thought
he
had
got
over
his
youthful
wildness
that
her
love
for
him
had
been
sufficiently
worth
while
to
enable
him
to
live
seriously
and
decently
and
now
her
father
and
mother
had
taken
a
firm
stand
and
commanded
that
the
engagement
be
broken
that
they
were
justified
in
this
she
could
not
but
admit
their
relation
could
never
be
a
happy
one
it
had
been
unfortunate
from
the
first
but
one
regret
she
voiced
in
the
whole
letter
and
it
was
a
bitter
one
to
martin
only
you
had
settled
down
to
some
position
and
attempted
to
make
something
of
yourself
she
wrote
it
was
not
to
be
your
past
life
had
been
too
wild
and
irregular
i
can
understand
that
you
are
not
to
be
blamed
you
could
act
only
according
to
your
nature
and
your
early
training
so
i
do
not
blame
you
martin
please
remember
that
it
was
simply
a
mistake
as
father
and
mother
have
contended
we
were
not
made
for
each
other
and
we
should
both
be
happy
because
it
was
discovered
not
too
is
no
use
trying
to
see
me
she
said
toward
the
last
would
be
an
unhappy
meeting
for
both
of
us
as
well
as
for
my
mother
i
feel
as
it
is
that
i
have
caused
her
great
pain
and
worry
i
shall
have
to
do
much
living
to
atone
for
he
read
it
through
to
the
end
carefully
a
second
time
then
sat
down
and
replied
he
outlined
the
remarks
he
had
uttered
at
the
socialist
meeting
pointing
out
that
they
were
in
all
ways
the
converse
of
what
the
newspaper
had
put
in
his
mouth
toward
the
end
of
the
letter
he
was
own
lover
pleading
passionately
for
love
answer
he
said
in
your
answer
you
have
to
tell
me
but
one
thing
do
you
love
me
that
is
answer
to
that
one
but
no
answer
came
the
next
day
nor
the
next
lay
untouched
upon
the
table
and
each
day
the
heap
of
returned
manuscripts
under
the
table
grew
larger
for
the
first
time
glorious
sleep
was
interrupted
by
insomnia
and
he
tossed
through
long
restless
nights
three
times
he
called
at
the
morse
home
but
was
turned
away
by
the
servant
who
answered
the
bell
brissenden
lay
sick
in
his
hotel
too
feeble
to
stir
out
and
though
martin
was
with
him
often
he
did
not
worry
him
with
his
troubles
for
troubles
were
many
the
aftermath
of
the
cub
deed
was
even
wider
than
martin
had
anticipated
the
portuguese
grocer
refused
him
further
credit
while
the
greengrocer
who
was
an
american
and
proud
of
it
had
called
him
a
traitor
to
his
country
and
refused
further
dealings
with
his
patriotism
to
such
a
degree
that
he
cancelled
account
and
forbade
him
ever
to
attempt
to
pay
it
the
talk
in
the
neighborhood
reflected
the
same
feeling
and
indignation
against
martin
ran
high
no
one
would
have
anything
to
do
with
a
socialist
traitor
poor
maria
was
dubious
and
frightened
but
she
remained
loyal
the
children
of
the
neighborhood
recovered
from
the
awe
of
the
grand
carriage
which
once
had
visited
martin
and
from
safe
distances
they
called
him
and
the
silva
tribe
however
stanchly
defended
him
fighting
more
than
one
pitched
battle
for
his
honor
and
black
eyes
and
bloody
noses
became
quite
the
order
of
the
day
and
added
to
perplexities
and
troubles
once
martin
met
gertrude
on
the
street
down
in
oakland
and
learned
what
he
knew
could
not
be
bernard
higginbotham
was
furious
with
him
for
having
dragged
the
family
into
public
disgrace
and
that
he
had
forbidden
him
the
house
you
go
away
martin
gertrude
had
begged
away
and
get
a
job
somewhere
and
steady
down
afterwards
when
this
all
blows
over
you
can
come
martin
shook
his
head
but
gave
no
explanations
how
could
he
explain
he
was
appalled
at
the
awful
intellectual
chasm
that
yawned
between
him
and
his
people
he
could
never
cross
it
and
explain
to
them
his
position
nietzschean
position
in
regard
to
socialism
there
were
not
words
enough
in
the
english
language
nor
in
any
language
to
make
his
attitude
and
conduct
intelligible
to
them
their
highest
concept
of
right
conduct
in
his
case
was
to
get
a
job
that
was
their
first
word
and
their
last
it
constituted
their
whole
lexicon
of
ideas
get
a
job
go
to
work
poor
stupid
slaves
he
thought
while
his
sister
talked
small
wonder
the
world
belonged
to
the
strong
the
slaves
were
obsessed
by
their
own
slavery
a
job
was
to
them
a
golden
fetich
before
which
they
fell
down
and
worshipped
he
shook
his
head
again
when
gertrude
offered
him
money
though
he
knew
that
within
the
day
he
would
have
to
make
a
trip
to
the
pawnbroker
come
near
bernard
now
she
admonished
him
a
few
months
when
he
is
cooled
down
if
you
want
to
you
can
get
the
job
of
for
him
any
time
you
want
me
just
send
for
me
come
she
went
away
weeping
audibly
and
he
felt
a
pang
of
sorrow
shoot
through
him
at
sight
of
her
heavy
body
and
uncouth
gait
as
he
watched
her
go
the
nietzschean
edifice
seemed
to
shake
and
totter
the
in
the
abstract
was
all
very
well
but
it
was
not
wholly
satisfactory
when
it
was
brought
home
to
his
own
family
and
yet
if
there
was
ever
a
slave
trampled
by
the
strong
that
slave
was
his
sister
gertrude
he
grinned
savagely
at
the
paradox
a
fine
he
was
to
allow
his
intellectual
concepts
to
be
shaken
by
the
first
sentiment
or
emotion
that
strayed
to
be
shaken
by
the
itself
for
that
was
what
his
pity
for
his
sister
really
was
the
true
noble
men
were
above
pity
and
compassion
pity
and
compassion
had
been
generated
in
the
subterranean
barracoons
of
the
slaves
and
were
no
more
than
the
agony
and
sweat
of
the
crowded
miserables
and
weaklings
chapter
xl
still
continued
to
lie
forgotten
on
the
table
every
manuscript
that
he
had
had
out
now
lay
under
the
table
only
one
manuscript
he
kept
going
and
that
was
his
bicycle
and
black
suit
were
again
in
pawn
and
the
people
were
once
more
worrying
about
the
rent
but
such
things
no
longer
bothered
him
he
was
seeking
a
new
orientation
and
until
that
was
found
his
life
must
stand
still
after
several
weeks
what
he
had
been
waiting
for
happened
he
met
ruth
on
the
street
it
was
true
she
was
accompanied
by
her
brother
norman
and
it
was
true
that
they
tried
to
ignore
him
and
that
norman
attempted
to
wave
him
aside
you
interfere
with
my
sister
call
an
officer
norman
threatened
does
not
wish
to
speak
with
you
and
your
insistence
is
you
persist
have
to
call
that
officer
and
then
get
your
name
in
the
papers
martin
answered
grimly
now
get
out
of
my
way
and
get
the
officer
if
you
want
to
going
to
talk
with
want
to
have
it
from
your
own
lips
he
said
to
her
she
was
pale
and
trembling
but
she
held
up
and
looked
inquiringly
question
i
asked
in
my
letter
he
prompted
norman
made
an
impatient
movement
but
martin
checked
him
with
a
swift
look
she
shook
her
head
all
this
of
your
own
free
will
he
demanded
she
spoke
in
a
low
firm
voice
and
with
deliberation
is
of
my
own
free
will
you
have
disgraced
me
so
that
i
am
ashamed
to
meet
my
friends
they
are
all
talking
about
me
i
know
that
is
all
i
can
tell
you
you
have
made
me
very
unhappy
and
i
never
wish
to
see
you
gossip
newspaper
misreports
surely
such
things
are
not
stronger
than
love
i
can
only
believe
that
you
never
loved
a
blush
drove
the
pallor
from
her
face
what
has
passed
she
said
faintly
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
i
am
not
see
she
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
norman
blurted
out
starting
on
with
her
martin
stood
aside
and
let
them
pass
fumbling
unconsciously
in
his
coat
pocket
for
the
tobacco
and
brown
papers
that
were
not
there
it
was
a
long
walk
to
north
oakland
but
it
was
not
until
he
went
up
the
steps
and
entered
his
room
that
he
knew
he
had
walked
it
he
found
himself
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
staring
about
him
like
an
awakened
somnambulist
he
noticed
lying
on
the
table
and
drew
up
his
chair
and
reached
for
his
pen
there
was
in
his
nature
a
logical
compulsion
toward
completeness
here
was
something
undone
it
had
been
deferred
against
the
completion
of
something
else
now
that
something
else
had
been
finished
and
he
would
apply
himself
to
this
task
until
it
was
finished
what
he
would
do
next
he
did
not
know
all
that
he
did
know
was
that
a
climacteric
in
his
life
had
been
attained
a
period
had
been
reached
and
he
was
rounding
it
off
in
fashion
he
was
not
curious
about
the
future
he
would
soon
enough
find
out
what
it
held
in
store
for
him
whatever
it
was
it
did
not
matter
nothing
seemed
to
matter
for
five
days
he
toiled
on
at
going
nowhere
seeing
nobody
and
eating
meagrely
on
the
morning
of
the
sixth
day
the
postman
brought
him
a
thin
letter
from
the
editor
of
a
glance
told
him
that
was
accepted
have
submitted
the
poem
to
cartwright
bruce
the
editor
went
on
to
say
he
has
reported
so
favorably
upon
it
that
we
can
not
let
it
go
as
an
earnest
of
our
pleasure
in
publishing
the
poem
let
me
tell
you
that
we
have
set
it
for
the
august
number
our
july
number
being
already
made
up
kindly
extend
our
pleasure
and
our
thanks
to
brissenden
please
send
by
return
mail
his
photograph
and
biographical
data
if
our
honorarium
is
unsatisfactory
kindly
telegraph
us
at
once
and
state
what
you
consider
a
fair
since
the
honorarium
they
had
offered
was
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
martin
thought
it
not
worth
while
to
telegraph
then
too
there
was
consent
to
be
gained
well
he
had
been
right
after
all
here
was
one
magazine
editor
who
knew
real
poetry
when
he
saw
it
and
the
price
was
splendid
even
though
it
was
for
the
poem
of
a
century
as
for
cartwright
bruce
martin
knew
that
he
was
the
one
critic
for
whose
opinions
brissenden
had
any
respect
martin
rode
down
town
on
an
electric
car
and
as
he
watched
the
houses
and
slipping
by
he
was
aware
of
a
regret
that
he
was
not
more
elated
over
his
success
and
over
his
own
signal
victory
the
one
critic
in
the
united
states
had
pronounced
favorably
on
the
poem
while
his
own
contention
that
good
stuff
could
find
its
way
into
the
magazines
had
proved
correct
but
enthusiasm
had
lost
its
spring
in
him
and
he
found
that
he
was
more
anxious
to
see
brissenden
than
he
was
to
carry
the
good
news
the
acceptance
of
had
recalled
to
him
that
during
his
five
devotion
to
he
had
not
heard
from
brissenden
nor
even
thought
about
him
for
the
first
time
martin
realized
the
daze
he
had
been
in
and
he
felt
shame
for
having
forgotten
his
friend
but
even
the
shame
did
not
burn
very
sharply
he
was
numb
to
emotions
of
any
sort
save
the
artistic
ones
concerned
in
the
writing
of
so
far
as
other
affairs
were
concerned
he
had
been
in
a
trance
for
that
matter
he
was
still
in
a
trance
all
this
life
through
which
the
electric
car
whirred
seemed
remote
and
unreal
and
he
would
have
experienced
little
interest
and
less
shock
if
the
great
stone
steeple
of
the
church
he
passed
had
suddenly
crumbled
to
upon
his
head
at
the
hotel
he
hurried
up
to
room
and
hurried
down
again
the
room
was
empty
all
luggage
was
gone
brissenden
leave
any
address
he
asked
the
clerk
who
looked
at
him
curiously
for
a
moment
you
heard
he
asked
martin
shook
his
head
the
papers
were
full
of
it
he
was
found
dead
in
bed
suicide
shot
himself
through
the
he
buried
yet
martin
seemed
to
hear
his
voice
like
some
one
voice
from
a
long
way
off
asking
the
question
the
body
was
shipped
east
after
the
inquest
lawyers
engaged
by
his
people
saw
to
the
were
quick
about
it
i
must
say
martin
commented
i
know
it
happened
five
days
days
ago
five
days
martin
said
as
he
turned
and
went
out
at
the
corner
he
stepped
into
the
western
union
and
sent
a
telegram
to
advising
them
to
proceed
with
the
publication
of
the
poem
he
had
in
his
pocket
but
five
cents
with
which
to
pay
his
carfare
home
so
he
sent
the
message
collect
once
in
his
room
he
resumed
his
writing
the
days
and
nights
came
and
went
and
he
sat
at
his
table
and
wrote
on
he
went
nowhere
save
to
the
pawnbroker
took
no
exercise
and
ate
methodically
when
he
was
hungry
and
had
something
to
cook
and
just
as
methodically
went
without
when
he
had
nothing
to
cook
composed
as
the
story
was
in
advance
chapter
by
chapter
he
nevertheless
saw
and
developed
an
opening
that
increased
the
power
of
it
though
it
necessitated
twenty
thousand
additional
words
it
was
not
that
there
was
any
vital
need
that
the
thing
should
be
well
done
but
that
his
artistic
canons
compelled
him
to
do
it
well
he
worked
on
in
the
daze
strangely
detached
from
the
world
around
him
feeling
like
a
familiar
ghost
among
these
literary
trappings
of
his
former
life
he
remembered
that
some
one
had
said
that
a
ghost
was
the
spirit
of
a
man
who
was
dead
and
who
did
not
have
sense
enough
to
know
it
and
he
paused
for
the
moment
to
wonder
if
he
were
really
dead
and
unaware
of
it
came
the
day
when
was
finished
the
agent
of
the
firm
had
come
for
the
machine
and
he
sat
on
the
bed
while
martin
on
the
one
chair
typed
the
last
pages
of
the
final
chapter
he
wrote
in
capitals
at
the
end
and
to
him
it
was
indeed
finis
he
watched
the
carried
out
the
door
with
a
feeling
of
relief
then
went
over
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
he
was
faint
from
hunger
food
had
not
passed
his
lips
in
hours
but
he
did
not
think
about
it
he
lay
on
his
back
with
closed
eyes
and
did
not
think
at
all
while
the
daze
or
stupor
slowly
welled
up
saturating
his
consciousness
half
in
delirium
he
began
muttering
aloud
the
lines
of
an
anonymous
poem
brissenden
had
been
fond
of
quoting
to
him
maria
listening
anxiously
outside
his
door
was
perturbed
by
his
monotonous
utterance
the
words
in
themselves
were
not
significant
to
her
but
the
fact
that
he
was
saying
them
was
have
done
was
the
burden
of
the
poem
have
put
by
the
lute
song
and
singing
soon
are
over
as
the
airy
shades
that
hover
in
among
the
purple
clover
i
have
put
by
the
lute
once
i
sang
as
early
thrushes
sing
among
the
dewy
bushes
now
mute
i
am
like
a
weary
linnet
for
my
throat
has
no
song
in
it
i
have
had
my
singing
minute
i
have
done
put
by
the
maria
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
hurried
away
to
the
stove
where
she
filled
a
with
soup
putting
into
it
the
share
of
chopped
meat
and
vegetables
which
her
ladle
scraped
from
the
bottom
of
the
pot
martin
roused
himself
and
sat
up
and
began
to
eat
between
spoonfuls
reassuring
maria
that
he
had
not
been
talking
in
his
sleep
and
that
he
did
not
have
any
fever
after
she
left
him
he
sat
drearily
with
drooping
shoulders
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
gazing
about
him
with
eyes
that
saw
nothing
until
the
torn
wrapper
of
a
magazine
which
had
come
in
the
mail
and
which
lay
unopened
shot
a
gleam
of
light
into
his
darkened
brain
it
is
he
thought
the
august
and
it
must
contain
if
only
brissenden
were
here
to
see
he
was
turning
the
pages
of
the
magazine
when
suddenly
he
stopped
had
been
featured
with
gorgeous
and
margin
decorations
on
one
side
of
the
was
photograph
on
the
other
side
was
the
photograph
of
sir
john
value
the
british
ambassador
a
preliminary
editorial
note
quoted
sir
john
value
as
saying
that
there
were
no
poets
in
america
and
the
publication
of
was
take
that
sir
john
value
cartwright
bruce
was
described
as
the
greatest
critic
in
america
and
he
was
quoted
as
saying
that
was
the
greatest
poem
ever
written
in
america
and
finally
the
foreword
ended
with
have
not
yet
made
up
our
minds
entirely
as
to
the
merits
of
perhaps
we
shall
never
be
able
to
do
so
but
we
have
read
it
often
wondering
at
the
words
and
their
arrangement
wondering
where
brissenden
got
them
and
how
he
could
fasten
them
then
followed
the
poem
good
thing
you
died
briss
old
man
martin
murmured
letting
the
magazine
slip
between
his
knees
to
the
floor
the
cheapness
and
vulgarity
of
it
was
nauseating
and
martin
noted
apathetically
that
he
was
not
nauseated
very
much
he
wished
he
could
get
angry
but
did
not
have
energy
enough
to
try
he
was
too
numb
his
blood
was
too
congealed
to
accelerate
to
the
swift
tidal
flow
of
indignation
after
all
what
did
it
matter
it
was
on
a
par
with
all
the
rest
that
brissenden
had
condemned
in
bourgeois
society
briss
martin
communed
would
never
have
forgiven
rousing
himself
with
an
effort
he
possessed
himself
of
a
box
which
had
once
contained
paper
going
through
its
contents
he
drew
forth
eleven
poems
which
his
friend
had
written
these
he
tore
lengthwise
and
crosswise
and
dropped
into
the
waste
basket
he
did
it
languidly
and
when
he
had
finished
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
staring
blankly
before
him
how
long
he
sat
there
he
did
not
know
until
suddenly
across
his
sightless
vision
he
saw
form
a
long
horizontal
line
of
white
it
was
curious
but
as
he
watched
it
grow
in
definiteness
he
saw
that
it
was
a
coral
reef
smoking
in
the
white
pacific
surges
next
in
the
line
of
breakers
he
made
out
a
small
canoe
an
outrigger
canoe
in
the
stern
he
saw
a
young
bronzed
god
in
scarlet
dipping
a
flashing
paddle
he
recognized
him
he
was
moti
the
youngest
son
of
tati
the
chief
and
this
was
tahiti
and
beyond
that
smoking
reef
lay
the
sweet
land
of
papara
and
the
grass
house
by
the
mouth
it
was
the
end
of
the
day
and
moti
was
coming
home
from
the
fishing
he
was
waiting
for
the
rush
of
a
big
breaker
whereon
to
jump
the
reef
then
he
saw
himself
sitting
forward
in
the
canoe
as
he
had
often
sat
in
the
past
dipping
a
paddle
that
waited
word
to
dig
in
like
mad
when
the
turquoise
wall
of
the
great
breaker
rose
behind
them
next
he
was
no
longer
an
onlooker
but
was
himself
in
the
canoe
moti
was
crying
out
they
were
both
thrusting
hard
with
their
paddles
racing
on
the
steep
face
of
the
flying
turquoise
under
the
bow
the
water
was
hissing
as
from
a
steam
jet
the
air
was
filled
with
driven
spray
there
was
a
rush
and
rumble
and
roar
and
the
canoe
floated
on
the
placid
water
of
the
lagoon
moti
laughed
and
shook
the
salt
water
from
his
eyes
and
together
they
paddled
in
to
the
beach
where
grass
walls
through
the
showed
golden
in
the
setting
sun
the
picture
faded
and
before
his
eyes
stretched
the
disorder
of
his
squalid
room
he
strove
in
vain
to
see
tahiti
again
he
knew
there
was
singing
among
the
trees
and
that
the
maidens
were
dancing
in
the
moonlight
but
he
could
not
see
them
he
could
see
only
the
littered
the
empty
space
where
the
had
stood
and
the
unwashed
he
closed
his
eyes
with
a
groan
and
slept

slept
heavily
all
night
and
did
not
stir
until
aroused
by
the
postman
on
his
morning
round
martin
felt
tired
and
passive
and
went
through
his
letters
aimlessly
one
thin
envelope
from
a
robber
magazine
contained
a
check
for
dollars
he
had
been
dunning
for
it
for
a
year
and
a
half
he
noted
its
amount
apathetically
the
thrill
at
receiving
a
check
was
gone
unlike
his
earlier
checks
this
one
was
not
pregnant
with
promise
of
great
things
to
come
to
him
it
was
a
check
for
dollars
that
was
all
and
it
would
buy
him
something
to
eat
another
check
was
in
the
same
mail
sent
from
a
new
york
weekly
in
payment
for
some
humorous
verse
which
had
been
accepted
months
before
it
was
for
ten
dollars
an
idea
came
to
him
which
he
calmly
considered
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
he
felt
in
no
hurry
to
do
anything
in
the
meantime
he
must
live
also
he
owed
numerous
debts
would
it
not
be
a
paying
investment
to
put
stamps
on
the
huge
pile
of
manuscripts
under
the
table
and
start
them
on
their
travels
again
one
or
two
of
them
might
be
accepted
that
would
help
him
to
live
he
decided
on
the
investment
and
after
he
had
cashed
the
checks
at
the
bank
down
in
oakland
he
bought
ten
worth
of
postage
stamps
the
thought
of
going
home
to
cook
breakfast
in
his
stuffy
little
room
was
repulsive
to
him
for
the
first
time
he
refused
to
consider
his
debts
he
knew
that
in
his
room
he
could
manufacture
a
substantial
breakfast
at
a
cost
of
from
fifteen
to
twenty
cents
but
instead
he
went
into
the
forum
café
and
ordered
a
breakfast
that
cost
two
dollars
he
tipped
the
waiter
a
quarter
and
spent
fifty
cents
for
a
package
of
egyptian
cigarettes
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
smoked
since
ruth
had
asked
him
to
stop
but
he
could
see
now
no
reason
why
he
should
not
and
besides
he
wanted
to
smoke
and
what
did
the
money
matter
for
five
cents
he
could
have
bought
a
package
of
durham
and
brown
papers
and
rolled
forty
what
of
it
money
had
no
meaning
to
him
now
except
what
it
would
immediately
buy
he
was
chartless
and
rudderless
and
he
had
no
port
to
make
while
drifting
involved
the
least
living
and
it
was
living
that
hurt
the
days
slipped
along
and
he
slept
eight
hours
regularly
every
night
though
now
while
waiting
for
more
checks
he
ate
in
the
japanese
restaurants
where
meals
were
served
for
ten
cents
his
wasted
body
filled
out
as
did
the
hollows
in
his
cheeks
he
no
longer
abused
himself
with
short
sleep
overwork
and
overstudy
he
wrote
nothing
and
the
books
were
closed
he
walked
much
out
in
the
hills
and
loafed
long
hours
in
the
quiet
parks
he
had
no
friends
nor
acquaintances
nor
did
he
make
any
he
had
no
inclination
he
was
waiting
for
some
impulse
from
he
knew
not
where
to
put
his
stopped
life
into
motion
again
in
the
meantime
his
life
remained
run
down
planless
and
empty
and
idle
once
he
made
a
trip
to
san
francisco
to
look
up
the
but
at
the
last
moment
as
he
stepped
into
the
upstairs
entrance
he
recoiled
and
turned
and
fled
through
the
swarming
ghetto
he
was
frightened
at
the
thought
of
hearing
philosophy
discussed
and
he
fled
furtively
for
fear
that
some
one
of
the
might
chance
along
and
recognize
him
sometimes
he
glanced
over
the
magazines
and
newspapers
to
see
how
was
being
maltreated
it
had
made
a
hit
but
what
a
hit
everybody
had
read
it
and
everybody
was
discussing
whether
or
not
it
was
really
poetry
the
local
papers
had
taken
it
up
and
daily
there
appeared
columns
of
learned
criticisms
facetious
editorials
and
serious
letters
from
subscribers
helen
della
delmar
proclaimed
with
a
flourish
of
trumpets
and
rolling
of
tomtoms
to
be
the
greatest
woman
poet
in
the
united
states
denied
brissenden
a
seat
beside
her
on
pegasus
and
wrote
voluminous
letters
to
the
public
proving
that
he
was
no
poet
came
out
in
its
next
number
patting
itself
on
the
back
for
the
stir
it
had
made
sneering
at
sir
john
value
and
exploiting
death
with
ruthless
commercialism
a
newspaper
with
a
sworn
circulation
of
half
a
million
published
an
original
and
spontaneous
poem
by
helen
della
delmar
in
which
she
gibed
and
sneered
at
brissenden
also
she
was
guilty
of
a
second
poem
in
which
she
parodied
him
martin
had
many
times
to
be
glad
that
brissenden
was
dead
he
had
hated
the
crowd
so
and
here
all
that
was
finest
and
most
sacred
of
him
had
been
thrown
to
the
crowd
daily
the
vivisection
of
beauty
went
on
every
nincompoop
in
the
land
rushed
into
free
print
floating
their
wizened
little
egos
into
the
public
eye
on
the
surge
of
greatness
quoth
one
paper
have
received
a
letter
from
a
gentleman
who
wrote
a
poem
just
like
it
only
better
some
time
another
paper
in
deadly
seriousness
reproving
helen
della
delmar
for
her
parody
said
unquestionably
miss
delmar
wrote
it
in
a
moment
of
badinage
and
not
quite
with
the
respect
that
one
great
poet
should
show
to
another
and
perhaps
to
the
greatest
however
whether
miss
delmar
be
jealous
or
not
of
the
man
who
invented
it
is
certain
that
she
like
thousands
of
others
is
fascinated
by
his
work
and
that
the
day
may
come
when
she
will
try
to
write
lines
like
ministers
began
to
preach
sermons
against
and
one
who
too
stoutly
stood
for
much
of
its
content
was
expelled
for
heresy
the
great
poem
contributed
to
the
gayety
of
the
world
the
comic
and
the
cartoonists
took
hold
of
it
with
screaming
laughter
and
in
the
personal
columns
of
society
weeklies
jokes
were
perpetrated
on
it
to
the
effect
that
charley
frensham
told
archie
jennings
in
confidence
that
five
lines
of
would
drive
a
man
to
beat
a
cripple
and
that
ten
lines
would
send
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
martin
did
not
laugh
nor
did
he
grit
his
teeth
in
anger
the
effect
produced
upon
him
was
one
of
great
sadness
in
the
crash
of
his
whole
world
with
love
on
the
pinnacle
the
crash
of
magazinedom
and
the
dear
public
was
a
small
crash
indeed
brissenden
had
been
wholly
right
in
his
judgment
of
the
magazines
and
he
martin
had
spent
arduous
and
futile
years
in
order
to
find
it
out
for
himself
the
magazines
were
all
brissenden
had
said
they
were
and
more
well
he
was
done
he
solaced
himself
he
had
hitched
his
wagon
to
a
star
and
been
landed
in
a
pestiferous
marsh
the
visions
of
sweet
coming
to
him
more
frequently
and
there
were
the
low
paumotus
and
the
high
marquesas
he
saw
himself
often
now
on
board
trading
schooners
or
frail
little
cutters
slipping
out
at
dawn
through
the
reef
at
papeete
and
beginning
the
long
beat
through
the
to
nukahiva
and
the
bay
of
taiohae
where
tamari
he
knew
would
kill
a
pig
in
honor
of
his
coming
and
where
daughters
would
seize
his
hands
and
with
song
and
laughter
garland
him
with
flowers
the
south
seas
were
calling
and
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
answer
the
call
in
the
meantime
he
drifted
resting
and
recuperating
after
the
long
traverse
he
had
made
through
the
realm
of
knowledge
when
check
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
was
forwarded
to
him
he
turned
it
over
to
the
local
lawyer
who
had
attended
to
affairs
for
his
family
martin
took
a
receipt
for
the
check
and
at
the
same
time
gave
a
note
for
the
hundred
dollars
brissenden
had
let
him
have
the
time
was
not
long
when
martin
ceased
patronizing
the
japanese
restaurants
at
the
very
moment
when
he
had
abandoned
the
fight
the
tide
turned
but
it
had
turned
too
late
without
a
thrill
he
opened
a
thick
envelope
from
scanned
the
face
of
a
check
that
represented
three
hundred
dollars
and
noted
that
it
was
the
payment
on
acceptance
for
every
debt
he
owed
in
the
world
including
the
pawnshop
with
its
usurious
interest
amounted
to
less
than
a
hundred
dollars
and
when
he
had
paid
everything
and
lifted
the
note
with
lawyer
he
still
had
over
a
hundred
dollars
in
pocket
he
ordered
a
suit
of
clothes
from
the
tailor
and
ate
his
meals
in
the
best
cafés
in
town
he
still
slept
in
his
little
room
at
but
the
sight
of
his
new
clothes
caused
the
neighborhood
children
to
cease
from
calling
him
and
from
the
roofs
of
woodsheds
and
over
back
fences
his
hawaiian
short
story
was
bought
by
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
northern
took
his
essay
cradle
of
beauty
and
took
poem
he
had
written
to
marian
the
editors
and
readers
were
back
from
their
summer
vacations
and
manuscripts
were
being
handled
quickly
but
martin
could
not
puzzle
out
what
strange
whim
animated
them
to
this
general
acceptance
of
the
things
they
had
persistently
rejected
for
two
years
nothing
of
his
had
been
published
he
was
not
known
anywhere
outside
of
oakland
and
in
oakland
with
the
few
who
thought
they
knew
him
he
was
notorious
as
a
and
a
socialist
so
there
was
no
explaining
this
sudden
acceptability
of
his
wares
it
was
sheer
jugglery
of
fate
after
it
had
been
refused
by
a
number
of
magazines
he
had
taken
rejected
advice
and
started
shame
of
the
on
the
round
of
publishers
after
several
refusals
singletree
darnley
accepted
it
promising
fall
publication
when
martin
asked
for
an
advance
on
royalties
they
wrote
that
such
was
not
their
custom
that
books
of
that
nature
rarely
paid
for
themselves
and
that
they
doubted
if
his
book
would
sell
a
thousand
copies
martin
figured
what
the
book
would
earn
him
on
such
a
sale
retailed
at
a
dollar
on
a
royalty
of
fifteen
per
cent
it
would
bring
him
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
he
decided
that
if
he
had
it
to
do
over
again
he
would
confine
himself
to
fiction
as
long
had
brought
him
twice
as
much
from
that
newspaper
paragraph
he
had
read
so
long
ago
had
been
true
after
all
the
magazines
did
not
pay
on
acceptance
and
they
paid
well
not
two
cents
a
word
but
four
cents
a
word
had
paid
him
and
furthermore
they
bought
good
stuff
too
for
were
they
not
buying
his
this
last
thought
he
accompanied
with
a
grin
he
wrote
to
singletree
darnley
offering
to
sell
out
his
rights
in
shame
of
the
for
a
hundred
dollars
but
they
did
not
care
to
take
the
risk
in
the
meantime
he
was
not
in
need
of
money
for
several
of
his
later
stories
had
been
accepted
and
paid
for
he
actually
opened
a
bank
account
where
without
a
debt
in
the
world
he
had
several
hundred
dollars
to
his
credit
after
having
been
declined
by
a
number
of
magazines
came
to
rest
at
the
company
martin
remembered
the
five
dollars
gertrude
had
given
him
and
his
resolve
to
return
it
to
her
a
hundred
times
over
so
he
wrote
for
an
advance
on
royalties
of
five
hundred
dollars
to
his
surprise
a
check
for
that
amount
accompanied
by
a
contract
came
by
return
mail
he
cashed
the
check
into
gold
pieces
and
telephoned
gertrude
that
he
wanted
to
see
her
she
arrived
at
the
house
panting
and
short
of
breath
from
the
haste
she
had
made
apprehensive
of
trouble
she
had
stuffed
the
few
dollars
she
possessed
into
her
and
so
sure
was
she
that
disaster
had
overtaken
her
brother
that
she
stumbled
forward
sobbing
into
his
arms
at
the
same
time
thrusting
the
satchel
mutely
at
him
have
come
myself
he
said
i
want
a
row
with
higginbotham
and
that
is
what
would
have
surely
be
all
right
after
a
time
she
assured
him
while
she
wondered
what
the
trouble
was
that
martin
was
in
best
get
a
job
first
steady
down
bernard
does
like
to
see
a
man
at
honest
work
that
stuff
in
the
newspapers
broke
all
up
i
never
saw
so
mad
not
going
to
get
a
job
martin
said
with
a
smile
you
can
tell
him
so
from
me
i
need
a
job
and
the
proof
of
he
emptied
the
hundred
gold
pieces
into
her
lap
in
a
glinting
tinkling
stream
remember
that
fiver
you
gave
me
the
time
i
have
carfare
well
there
it
is
with
brothers
of
different
ages
but
all
of
the
same
if
gertrude
had
been
frightened
when
she
arrived
she
was
now
in
a
panic
of
fear
her
fear
was
such
that
it
was
certitude
she
was
not
suspicious
she
was
convinced
she
looked
at
martin
in
horror
and
her
heavy
limbs
shrank
under
the
golden
stream
as
though
it
were
burning
her
yours
he
laughed
she
burst
into
tears
and
began
to
moan
poor
boy
my
poor
boy
he
was
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
he
divined
the
cause
of
her
agitation
and
handed
her
the
letter
which
had
accompanied
the
check
she
stumbled
through
it
pausing
now
and
again
to
wipe
her
eyes
and
when
she
had
finished
said
does
it
mean
that
you
come
by
the
money
honestly
honestly
than
if
won
it
in
a
lottery
i
earned
slowly
faith
came
back
to
her
and
she
reread
the
letter
carefully
it
took
him
long
to
explain
to
her
the
nature
of
the
transaction
which
had
put
the
money
into
his
possession
and
longer
still
to
get
her
to
understand
that
the
money
was
really
hers
and
that
he
did
not
need
it
put
it
in
the
bank
for
you
she
said
finally
do
nothing
of
the
sort
yours
to
do
with
as
you
please
and
if
you
take
it
give
it
to
maria
know
what
to
do
with
it
suggest
though
that
you
hire
a
servant
and
take
a
good
long
to
tell
bernard
all
about
it
she
announced
when
she
was
leaving
martin
winced
then
grinned
do
he
said
then
maybe
invite
me
to
dinner
he
sure
he
will
she
exclaimed
fervently
as
she
drew
him
to
her
and
kissed
and
hugged
him
chapter
xlii
one
day
martin
became
aware
that
he
was
lonely
he
was
healthy
and
strong
and
had
nothing
to
do
the
cessation
from
writing
and
studying
the
death
of
brissenden
and
the
estrangement
from
ruth
had
made
a
big
hole
in
his
life
and
his
life
refused
to
be
pinned
down
to
good
living
in
cafés
and
the
smoking
of
egyptian
cigarettes
it
was
true
the
south
seas
were
calling
to
him
but
he
had
a
feeling
that
the
game
was
not
yet
played
out
in
the
united
states
two
books
were
soon
to
be
published
and
he
had
more
books
that
might
find
publication
money
could
be
made
out
of
them
and
he
would
wait
and
take
a
sackful
of
it
into
the
south
seas
he
knew
a
valley
and
a
bay
in
the
marquesas
that
he
could
buy
for
a
thousand
chili
dollars
the
valley
ran
from
the
horseshoe
bay
to
the
tops
of
the
dizzy
peaks
and
contained
perhaps
ten
thousand
acres
it
was
filled
with
tropical
fruits
wild
chickens
and
wild
pigs
with
an
occasional
herd
of
wild
cattle
while
high
up
among
the
peaks
were
herds
of
wild
goats
harried
by
packs
of
wild
dogs
the
whole
place
was
wild
not
a
human
lived
in
it
and
he
could
buy
it
and
the
bay
for
a
thousand
chili
dollars
the
bay
as
he
remembered
it
was
magnificent
with
water
deep
enough
to
accommodate
the
largest
vessel
afloat
and
so
safe
that
the
south
pacific
directory
recommended
it
as
the
best
careening
place
for
ships
for
hundreds
of
miles
around
he
would
buy
a
of
those
coppered
crafts
that
sailed
like
go
trading
copra
and
pearling
among
the
islands
he
would
make
the
valley
and
the
bay
his
headquarters
he
would
build
a
patriarchal
grass
house
like
and
have
it
and
the
valley
and
the
schooner
filled
with
servitors
he
would
entertain
there
the
factor
of
taiohae
captains
of
wandering
traders
and
all
the
best
of
the
south
pacific
riffraff
he
would
keep
open
house
and
entertain
like
a
prince
and
he
would
forget
the
books
he
had
opened
and
the
world
that
had
proved
an
illusion
to
do
all
this
he
must
wait
in
california
to
fill
the
sack
with
money
already
it
was
beginning
to
flow
in
if
one
of
the
books
made
a
strike
it
might
enable
him
to
sell
the
whole
heap
of
manuscripts
also
he
could
collect
the
stories
and
the
poems
into
books
and
make
sure
of
the
valley
and
the
bay
and
the
schooner
he
would
never
write
again
upon
that
he
was
resolved
but
in
the
meantime
awaiting
the
publication
of
the
books
he
must
do
something
more
than
live
dazed
and
stupid
in
the
sort
of
uncaring
trance
into
which
he
had
fallen
he
noted
one
sunday
morning
that
the
picnic
took
place
that
day
at
shell
mound
park
and
to
shell
mound
park
he
went
he
had
been
to
the
picnics
too
often
in
his
earlier
life
not
to
know
what
they
were
like
and
as
he
entered
the
park
he
experienced
a
recrudescence
of
all
the
old
sensations
after
all
they
were
his
kind
these
working
people
he
had
been
born
among
them
he
had
lived
among
them
and
though
he
had
strayed
for
a
time
it
was
well
to
come
back
among
them
it
mart
he
heard
some
one
say
and
the
next
moment
a
hearty
hand
was
on
his
shoulder
you
ben
all
the
time
off
to
sea
come
on
have
a
it
was
the
old
crowd
in
which
he
found
old
crowd
with
here
and
there
a
gap
and
here
and
there
a
new
face
the
fellows
were
not
bricklayers
but
as
in
the
old
days
they
attended
all
sunday
picnics
for
the
dancing
and
the
fighting
and
the
fun
martin
drank
with
them
and
began
to
feel
really
human
once
more
he
was
a
fool
to
have
ever
left
them
he
thought
and
he
was
very
certain
that
his
sum
of
happiness
would
have
been
greater
had
he
remained
with
them
and
let
alone
the
books
and
the
people
who
sat
in
the
high
places
yet
the
beer
seemed
not
so
good
as
of
yore
it
taste
as
it
used
to
taste
brissenden
had
spoiled
him
for
steam
beer
he
concluded
and
wondered
if
after
all
the
books
had
spoiled
him
for
companionship
with
these
friends
of
his
youth
he
resolved
that
he
would
not
be
so
spoiled
and
he
went
on
to
the
dancing
pavilion
jimmy
the
plumber
he
met
there
in
the
company
of
a
tall
blond
girl
who
promptly
forsook
him
for
martin
like
old
times
jimmy
explained
to
the
gang
that
gave
him
the
laugh
as
martin
and
the
blonde
whirled
away
in
a
waltz
i
give
a
rap
too
damned
glad
to
see
back
watch
waltz
eh
like
silk
blame
any
girl
but
martin
restored
the
blonde
to
jimmy
and
the
three
of
them
with
half
a
dozen
friends
watched
the
revolving
couples
and
laughed
and
joked
with
one
another
everybody
was
glad
to
see
martin
back
no
book
of
his
been
published
he
carried
no
fictitious
value
in
their
eyes
they
liked
him
for
himself
he
felt
like
a
prince
returned
from
excile
and
his
lonely
heart
burgeoned
in
the
geniality
in
which
it
bathed
he
made
a
mad
day
of
it
and
was
at
his
best
also
he
had
money
in
his
pockets
and
as
in
the
old
days
when
he
returned
from
sea
with
a
he
made
the
money
fly
once
on
the
he
saw
lizzie
connolly
go
by
in
the
arms
of
a
young
workingman
and
later
when
he
made
the
round
of
the
pavilion
he
came
upon
her
sitting
by
a
refreshment
table
surprise
and
greetings
over
he
led
her
away
into
the
grounds
where
they
could
talk
without
shouting
down
the
music
from
the
instant
he
spoke
to
her
she
was
his
he
knew
it
she
showed
it
in
the
proud
humility
of
her
eyes
in
every
caressing
movement
of
her
proudly
carried
body
and
in
the
way
she
hung
upon
his
speech
she
was
not
the
young
girl
as
he
had
known
her
she
was
a
woman
now
and
martin
noted
that
her
wild
defiant
beauty
had
improved
losing
none
of
its
wildness
while
the
defiance
and
the
fire
seemed
more
in
control
beauty
a
perfect
beauty
he
murmured
admiringly
under
his
breath
and
he
knew
she
was
his
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
say
and
she
would
go
with
him
over
the
world
wherever
he
led
even
as
the
thought
flashed
through
his
brain
he
received
a
heavy
blow
on
the
side
of
his
head
that
nearly
knocked
him
down
it
was
a
fist
directed
by
a
man
so
angry
and
in
such
haste
that
the
fist
had
missed
the
jaw
for
which
it
was
aimed
martin
turned
as
he
staggered
and
saw
the
fist
coming
at
him
in
a
wild
swing
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
he
ducked
and
the
fist
flew
harmlessly
past
pivoting
the
man
who
had
driven
it
martin
hooked
with
his
left
landing
on
the
pivoting
man
with
the
weight
of
his
body
behind
the
blow
the
man
went
to
the
ground
sidewise
leaped
to
his
feet
and
made
a
mad
rush
martin
saw
his
face
and
wondered
what
could
be
the
cause
of
the
anger
but
while
he
wondered
he
shot
in
a
straight
left
the
weight
of
his
body
behind
the
blow
the
man
went
over
backward
and
fell
in
a
crumpled
heap
jimmy
and
others
of
the
gang
were
running
toward
them
martin
was
thrilling
all
over
this
was
the
old
days
with
a
vengeance
with
their
dancing
and
their
fighting
and
their
fun
while
he
kept
a
wary
eye
on
his
antagonist
he
glanced
at
lizzie
usually
the
girls
screamed
when
the
fellows
got
to
scrapping
but
she
had
not
screamed
she
was
looking
on
with
bated
breath
leaning
slightly
forward
so
keen
was
her
interest
one
hand
pressed
to
her
breast
her
cheek
flushed
and
in
her
eyes
a
great
and
amazed
admiration
the
man
had
gained
his
feet
and
was
struggling
to
escape
the
restraining
arms
that
were
laid
on
him
was
for
me
to
come
back
he
was
proclaiming
to
all
and
sundry
was
for
me
to
come
back
then
that
fresh
guy
comes
in
let
go
me
i
tell
yeh
to
fix
yer
jimmy
was
demanding
as
he
helped
hold
the
young
fellow
back
mart
eden
nifty
with
his
mits
lem
me
tell
you
that
eat
you
alive
if
you
monkey
with
steal
her
on
me
that
way
the
other
interjected
licked
the
dutchman
you
know
jimmy
went
on
expostulating
he
did
it
in
five
rounds
you
last
a
minute
against
him
see
this
information
seemed
to
have
a
mollifying
effect
and
the
irate
young
man
favored
martin
with
a
measuring
stare
look
it
he
sneered
but
the
sneer
was
without
passion
what
the
dutchman
thought
jimmy
assured
him
on
now
get
outa
this
lots
of
other
girls
come
the
young
fellow
allowed
himself
to
be
led
away
toward
the
pavilion
and
the
gang
followed
after
him
is
he
martin
asked
lizzie
it
all
about
anyway
already
the
zest
of
combat
which
of
old
had
been
so
keen
and
lasting
had
died
down
and
he
discovered
that
he
was
too
much
so
to
live
single
heart
and
single
hand
so
primitive
an
existence
lizzie
tossed
her
head
nobody
she
said
just
ben
company
with
had
to
you
see
she
explained
after
a
pause
was
pretty
lonesome
but
i
never
her
voice
sank
lower
and
she
looked
straight
before
her
throw
down
for
you
any
martin
looking
at
her
averted
face
knowing
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
reach
out
his
hand
and
pluck
her
fell
to
pondering
whether
after
all
there
was
any
real
worth
in
refined
grammatical
english
and
so
forgot
to
reply
to
her
put
it
all
over
him
she
said
tentatively
with
a
laugh
a
husky
young
fellow
though
he
admitted
generously
they
taken
him
away
he
might
have
given
me
my
hands
was
that
lady
friend
i
seen
you
with
that
night
she
asked
abruptly
just
a
lady
friend
was
his
answer
was
a
long
time
ago
she
murmured
contemplatively
seems
like
a
thousand
but
martin
went
no
further
into
the
matter
he
led
the
conversation
off
into
other
channels
they
had
lunch
in
the
restaurant
where
he
ordered
wine
and
expensive
delicacies
and
afterward
he
danced
with
her
and
with
no
one
but
her
till
she
was
tired
he
was
a
good
dancer
and
she
whirled
around
and
around
with
him
in
a
heaven
of
delight
her
head
against
his
shoulder
wishing
that
it
could
last
forever
later
in
the
afternoon
they
strayed
off
among
the
trees
where
in
the
good
old
fashion
she
sat
down
while
he
sprawled
on
his
back
his
head
in
her
lap
he
lay
and
dozed
while
she
fondled
his
hair
looked
down
on
his
closed
eyes
and
loved
him
without
reserve
looking
up
suddenly
he
read
the
tender
advertisement
in
her
face
her
eyes
fluttered
down
then
they
opened
and
looked
into
his
with
soft
defiance
kept
straight
all
these
years
she
said
her
voice
so
low
that
it
was
almost
a
whisper
in
his
heart
martin
knew
that
it
was
the
miraculous
truth
and
at
his
heart
pleaded
a
great
temptation
it
was
in
his
power
to
make
her
happy
denied
happiness
himself
why
should
he
deny
happiness
to
her
he
could
marry
her
and
take
her
down
with
him
to
dwell
in
the
castle
in
the
marquesas
the
desire
to
do
it
was
strong
but
stronger
still
was
the
imperative
command
of
his
nature
not
to
do
it
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
still
faithful
to
love
the
old
days
of
license
and
easy
living
were
gone
he
could
not
bring
them
back
nor
could
he
go
back
to
them
he
was
changed
he
had
not
realized
until
now
am
not
a
marrying
man
lizzie
he
said
lightly
the
hand
caressing
his
hair
paused
perceptibly
then
went
on
with
the
same
gentle
stroke
he
noticed
her
face
harden
but
it
was
with
the
hardness
of
resolution
for
still
the
soft
color
was
in
her
cheeks
and
she
was
all
glowing
and
melting
did
not
mean
she
began
then
faltered
anyway
i
care
she
repeated
proud
to
be
your
friend
do
anything
for
you
made
that
way
i
martin
sat
up
he
took
her
hand
in
his
he
did
it
deliberately
with
warmth
but
without
passion
and
such
warmth
chilled
her
talk
about
it
she
said
are
a
great
and
noble
woman
he
said
it
is
i
who
should
be
proud
to
know
you
and
i
am
i
am
you
are
a
ray
of
light
to
me
in
a
very
dark
world
and
got
to
be
straight
with
you
just
as
straight
as
you
have
care
whether
straight
with
me
or
not
you
could
do
anything
with
me
you
could
throw
me
in
the
dirt
walk
on
me
the
only
man
in
the
world
that
can
she
added
with
a
defiant
flash
taken
care
of
myself
ever
since
i
was
a
kid
for
just
because
of
that
that
not
going
to
he
said
gently
are
so
big
and
generous
that
you
challenge
me
to
equal
generousness
not
marrying
and
loving
without
marrying
though
done
my
share
of
that
in
the
past
sorry
i
came
here
and
met
you
but
it
be
helped
now
and
i
never
expected
it
would
turn
out
this
way
look
here
lizzie
i
begin
to
tell
you
how
much
i
like
you
i
do
more
than
like
you
i
admire
and
respect
you
you
are
magnificent
and
you
are
magnificently
good
but
the
use
of
words
yet
something
like
to
do
had
a
hard
life
let
me
make
it
easy
for
a
joyous
light
welled
into
her
eyes
then
faded
out
again
pretty
sure
of
getting
hold
of
some
money
of
in
that
moment
he
abandoned
the
idea
of
the
valley
and
the
bay
the
castle
and
the
trim
white
schooner
after
all
what
did
it
matter
he
could
go
away
as
he
had
done
so
often
before
the
mast
on
any
ship
bound
anywhere
like
to
turn
it
over
to
you
there
must
be
something
you
go
to
school
or
business
college
you
might
like
to
study
and
be
a
stenographer
i
could
fix
it
for
you
or
maybe
your
father
and
mother
are
could
set
them
up
in
a
grocery
store
or
something
anything
you
want
just
name
it
and
i
can
fix
it
for
she
made
no
reply
but
sat
gazing
straight
before
her
and
motionless
but
with
an
ache
in
the
throat
which
martin
divined
so
strongly
that
it
made
his
own
throat
ache
he
regretted
that
he
had
spoken
it
seemed
so
tawdry
what
he
had
offered
with
what
she
offered
him
he
offered
her
an
extraneous
thing
with
which
he
could
part
without
a
pang
while
she
offered
him
herself
along
with
disgrace
and
shame
and
sin
and
all
her
hopes
of
heaven
talk
about
it
she
said
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
that
she
changed
to
a
cough
she
stood
up
on
go
home
all
tired
the
day
was
done
and
the
merrymakers
had
nearly
all
departed
but
as
martin
and
lizzie
emerged
from
the
trees
they
found
the
gang
waiting
for
them
martin
knew
immediately
the
meaning
of
it
trouble
was
brewing
the
gang
was
his
they
passed
out
through
the
gates
of
the
park
with
straggling
in
the
rear
a
second
gang
the
friends
that
young
man
had
collected
to
avenge
the
loss
of
his
lady
several
constables
and
special
police
officers
anticipating
trouble
trailed
along
to
prevent
it
and
herded
the
two
gangs
separately
aboard
the
train
for
san
francisco
martin
told
jimmy
that
he
would
get
off
at
sixteenth
street
station
and
catch
the
electric
car
into
oakland
lizzie
was
very
quiet
and
without
interest
in
what
was
impending
the
train
pulled
in
to
sixteenth
street
station
and
the
waiting
electric
car
could
be
seen
the
conductor
of
which
was
impatiently
clanging
the
gong
she
is
jimmy
counselled
a
run
for
it
hold
back
now
you
go
hit
her
up
the
hostile
gang
was
temporarily
disconcerted
by
the
manoeuvre
then
it
dashed
from
the
train
in
pursuit
the
staid
and
sober
oakland
folk
who
sat
upon
the
car
scarcely
noted
the
young
fellow
and
the
girl
who
ran
for
it
and
found
a
seat
in
front
on
the
outside
they
did
not
connect
the
couple
with
jimmy
who
sprang
on
the
steps
crying
to
the
motorman
on
the
juice
old
man
and
beat
it
outa
here
the
next
moment
jimmy
whirled
about
and
the
passengers
saw
him
land
his
fist
on
the
face
of
a
running
man
who
was
trying
to
board
the
car
but
fists
were
landing
on
faces
the
whole
length
of
the
car
thus
jimmy
and
his
gang
strung
out
on
the
long
lower
steps
met
the
attacking
gang
the
car
started
with
a
great
clanging
of
its
gong
and
as
gang
drove
off
the
last
assailants
they
too
jumped
off
to
finish
the
job
the
car
dashed
on
leaving
the
flurry
of
combat
far
behind
and
its
dumfounded
passengers
never
dreamed
that
the
quiet
young
man
and
the
pretty
sitting
in
the
corner
on
the
outside
seat
had
been
the
cause
of
the
row
martin
had
enjoyed
the
fight
with
a
recrudescence
of
the
old
fighting
thrills
but
they
quickly
died
away
and
he
was
oppressed
by
a
great
sadness
he
felt
very
older
than
those
careless
young
companions
of
his
others
days
he
had
travelled
far
too
far
to
go
back
their
mode
of
life
which
had
once
been
his
was
now
distasteful
to
him
he
was
disappointed
in
it
all
he
had
developed
into
an
alien
as
the
steam
beer
had
tasted
raw
so
their
companionship
seemed
raw
to
him
he
was
too
far
removed
too
many
thousands
of
opened
books
yawned
between
them
and
him
he
had
exiled
himself
he
had
travelled
in
the
vast
realm
of
intellect
until
he
could
no
longer
return
home
on
the
other
hand
he
was
human
and
his
gregarious
need
for
companionship
remained
unsatisfied
he
had
found
no
new
home
as
the
gang
could
not
understand
him
as
his
own
family
could
not
understand
him
as
the
bourgeoisie
could
not
understand
him
so
this
girl
beside
him
whom
he
honored
high
could
not
understand
him
nor
the
honor
he
paid
her
his
sadness
was
not
untouched
with
bitterness
as
he
thought
it
over
it
up
with
him
he
advised
lizzie
at
parting
as
they
stood
in
front
of
the
shack
in
which
she
lived
near
sixth
and
market
he
referred
to
the
young
fellow
whose
place
he
had
usurped
that
day
she
said
go
on
he
said
jovially
you
have
to
do
is
whistle
and
come
mean
that
she
said
simply
and
he
knew
what
she
had
meant
she
leaned
toward
him
as
he
was
about
to
say
good
night
but
she
leaned
not
imperatively
not
seductively
but
wistfully
and
humbly
he
was
touched
to
the
heart
his
large
tolerance
rose
up
in
him
he
put
his
arms
around
her
and
kissed
her
and
knew
that
upon
his
own
lips
rested
as
true
a
kiss
as
man
ever
received
god
she
sobbed
could
die
for
you
i
could
die
for
she
tore
herself
from
him
suddenly
and
ran
up
the
steps
he
felt
a
quick
moisture
in
his
eyes
eden
he
communed
not
a
brute
and
a
damn
poor
nietzscheman
marry
her
if
you
could
and
fill
her
quivering
heart
full
with
happiness
but
you
you
and
a
damn
poor
old
tramp
explains
his
poor
old
ulcers
he
muttered
remembering
his
henly
is
i
think
a
blunder
and
a
it

of
the
was
published
in
october
as
martin
cut
the
cords
of
the
express
package
and
the
complimentary
copies
from
the
publishers
spilled
out
on
the
table
a
heavy
sadness
fell
upon
him
he
thought
of
the
wild
delight
that
would
have
been
his
had
this
happened
a
few
short
months
before
and
he
contrasted
that
delight
that
should
have
been
with
his
present
uncaring
coldness
his
book
his
first
book
and
his
pulse
had
not
gone
up
a
fraction
of
a
beat
and
he
was
only
sad
it
meant
little
to
him
now
the
most
it
meant
was
that
it
might
bring
some
money
and
little
enough
did
he
care
for
money
he
carried
a
copy
out
into
the
kitchen
and
presented
it
to
maria
did
it
he
explained
in
order
to
clear
up
her
bewilderment
wrote
it
in
the
room
there
and
i
guess
some
few
quarts
of
your
vegetable
soup
went
into
the
making
of
it
keep
it
yours
just
to
remember
me
by
you
he
was
not
bragging
not
showing
off
his
sole
motive
was
to
make
her
happy
to
make
her
proud
of
him
to
justify
her
long
faith
in
him
she
put
the
book
in
the
front
room
on
top
of
the
family
bible
a
sacred
thing
was
this
book
her
lodger
had
made
a
fetich
of
friendship
it
softened
the
blow
of
his
having
been
a
laundryman
and
though
she
could
not
understand
a
line
of
it
she
knew
that
every
line
of
it
was
great
she
was
a
simple
practical
woman
but
she
possessed
faith
in
large
endowment
just
as
emotionlessly
as
he
had
received
shame
of
the
did
he
read
the
reviews
of
it
that
came
in
weekly
from
the
clipping
bureau
the
book
was
making
a
hit
that
was
evident
it
meant
more
gold
in
the
money
sack
he
could
fix
up
lizzie
redeem
all
his
promises
and
still
have
enough
left
to

cautiously
brought

an
edition
of
fifteen
hundred

but
the
first

had
started
a
second

of

through
the

and
ere
this
was
delivered
a
third
edition
of
five
thousand

been

a

came
the

the

a

the

the

but
more
of
this
martin
laid
down
the
letter
and
worked
a
problem
in
mental
arithmetic
finding
the
product
of
fifteen
cents
times
sixty
thousand
to
be
nine
thousand
dollars
he
signed
the
new
contract
inserting
smoke
of

the
blank
space
and
mailed
it
back
to
the
publishers
along
with
the
twenty
storiettes
he
had
written
in
the
days
before
he
discovered
the
formula
for
the
newspaper
storiette
and
promptly
as
the
united
states
mail
could
deliver
and
return
came
singletree
darnley
check
for
five
thousand
dollars
want
you
to
come
down
town
with
me
maria
this
afternoon
about
two
martin
said
the
morning
the
check
arrived
better
meet
me
at
fourteenth
and
broadway
at
two
be
looking
out
for
at
the
appointed
time
she
was
there
but
was
the
only
clew
to
the
mystery
her
mind
had
been
capable
of
evolving
and
she
suffered
a
distinct
shock
of
disappointment
when
martin
walked
her
right
by
a
and
dived
into
a
real
estate
office
what
happened
thereupon
resided
forever
after
in
her
memory
as
a
dream
fine
gentlemen
smiled
at
her
benevolently
as
they
talked
with
martin
and
one
another
a
clicked
signatures
were
affixed
to
an
imposing
document
her
own
landlord
was
there
too
and
affixed
his
signature
and
when
all
was
over
and
she
was
outside
on
the
sidewalk
her
landlord
spoke
to
her
saying
maria
you
have
to
pay
me
no
seven
dollars
and
a
half
this
maria
was
too
stunned
for
speech
next
month
or
the
next
or
the
next
her
landlord
said
she
thanked
him
incoherently
as
if
for
a
favor
and
it
was
not
until
she
had
returned
home
to
north
oakland
and
conferred
with
her
own
kind
and
had
the
portuguese
grocer
investigate
that
she
really
knew
that
she
was
the
owner
of
the
little
house
in
which
she
had
lived
and
for
which
she
had
paid
rent
so
long
you
trade
with
me
no
more
the
portuguese
grocer
asked
martin
that
evening
stepping
out
to
hail
him
when
he
got
off
the
car
and
martin
explained
that
he
doing
his
own
cooking
any
more
and
then
went
in
and
had
a
drink
of
wine
on
the
house
he
noted
it
was
the
best
wine
the
grocer
had
in
stock
martin
announced
that
night
going
to
leave
you
and
going
to
leave
here
yourself
soon
then
you
can
rent
the
house
and
be
a
landlord
yourself
a
brother
in
san
leandro
or
haywards
and
in
the
milk
business
i
want
you
to
send
all
your
washing
back
and
to
go
out
to
san
leandro
or
haywards
or
wherever
it
is
and
see
that
brother
of
yours
tell
him
to
come
to
see
me
be
stopping
at
the
metropole
down
in
oakland
know
a
good
when
he
sees
and
so
it
was
that
maria
became
a
landlord
and
the
sole
owner
of
a
dairy
with
two
hired
men
to
do
the
work
for
her
and
a
bank
account
that
steadily
increased
despite
the
fact
that
her
whole
brood
wore
shoes
and
went
to
school
few
persons
ever
meet
the
fairy
princes
they
dream
about
but
maria
who
worked
hard
and
whose
head
was
hard
never
dreaming
about
fairy
princes
entertained
hers
in
the
guise
of
an
in
the
meantime
the
world
had
begun
to
ask
is
this
martin
eden
he
had
declined
to
give
any
biographical
data
to
his
publishers
but
the
newspapers
were
not
to
be
denied
oakland
was
his
own
town
and
the
reporters
nosed
out
scores
of
individuals
who
could
supply
information
all
that
he
was
and
was
not
all
that
he
had
done
and
most
of
what
he
had
not
done
was
spread
out
for
the
delectation
of
the
public
accompanied
by
snapshots
and
latter
procured
from
the
local
photographer
who
had
once
taken
picture
and
who
promptly
copyrighted
it
and
put
it
on
the
market
at
first
so
great
was
his
disgust
with
the
magazines
and
all
bourgeois
society
martin
fought
against
publicity
but
in
the
end
because
it
was
easier
than
not
to
he
surrendered
he
found
that
he
could
not
refuse
himself
to
the
special
writers
who
travelled
long
distances
to
see
him
then
again
each
day
was
so
many
hours
long
and
since
he
no
longer
was
occupied
with
writing
and
studying
those
hours
had
to
be
occupied
somehow
so
he
yielded
to
what
was
to
him
a
whim
permitted
interviews
gave
his
opinions
on
literature
and
philosophy
and
even
accepted
invitations
of
the
bourgeoisie
he
had
settled
down
into
a
strange
and
comfortable
state
of
mind
he
no
longer
cared
he
forgave
everybody
even
the
cub
reporter
who
had
painted
him
red
and
to
whom
he
now
granted
a
full
page
with
specially
posed
photographs
he
saw
lizzie
occasionally
and
it
was
patent
that
she
regretted
the
greatness
that
had
come
to
him
it
widened
the
space
between
them
perhaps
it
was
with
the
hope
of
narrowing
it
that
she
yielded
to
his
persuasions
to
go
to
night
school
and
business
college
and
to
have
herself
gowned
by
a
wonderful
dressmaker
who
charged
outrageous
prices
she
improved
visibly
from
day
to
day
until
martin
wondered
if
he
was
doing
right
for
he
knew
that
all
her
compliance
and
endeavor
was
for
his
sake
she
was
trying
to
make
herself
of
worth
in
his
the
sort
of
worth
he
seemed
to
value
yet
he
gave
her
no
hope
treating
her
in
brotherly
fashion
and
rarely
seeing
her
was
rushed
upon
the
market
by
the
company
in
the
height
of
his
popularity
and
being
fiction
in
point
of
sales
it
made
even
a
bigger
strike
than
shame
of
the
week
after
week
his
was
the
credit
of
the
unprecedented
performance
of
having
two
books
at
the
head
of
the
list
of
not
only
did
the
story
take
with
the
but
those
who
read
shame
of
the
with
avidity
were
likewise
attracted
to
the
by
the
cosmic
grasp
of
mastery
with
which
he
had
handled
it
first
he
had
attacked
the
literature
of
mysticism
and
had
done
it
exceeding
well
and
next
he
had
successfully
supplied
the
very
literature
he
had
exposited
thus
proving
himself
to
be
that
rare
genius
a
critic
and
a
creator
in
one
money
poured
in
on
him
fame
poured
in
on
him
he
flashed
through
the
world
of
literature
and
he
was
more
amused
than
interested
by
the
stir
he
was
making
one
thing
was
puzzling
him
a
little
thing
that
would
have
puzzled
the
world
had
it
known
but
the
world
would
have
puzzled
over
his
bepuzzlement
rather
than
over
the
little
thing
that
to
him
loomed
gigantic
judge
blount
invited
him
to
dinner
that
was
the
little
thing
or
the
beginning
of
the
little
thing
that
was
soon
to
become
the
big
thing
he
had
insulted
judge
blount
treated
him
abominably
and
judge
blount
meeting
him
on
the
street
invited
him
to
dinner
martin
bethought
himself
of
the
numerous
occasions
on
which
he
had
met
judge
blount
at
the
and
when
judge
blount
had
not
invited
him
to
dinner
why
had
he
not
invited
him
to
dinner
then
he
asked
himself
he
had
not
changed
he
was
the
same
martin
eden
what
made
the
difference
the
fact
that
the
stuff
he
had
written
had
appeared
inside
the
covers
of
books
but
it
was
work
performed
it
was
not
something
he
had
done
since
it
was
achievement
accomplished
at
the
very
time
judge
blount
was
sharing
this
general
view
and
sneering
at
his
spencer
and
his
intellect
therefore
it
was
not
for
any
real
value
but
for
a
purely
fictitious
value
that
judge
blount
invited
him
to
dinner
martin
grinned
and
accepted
the
invitation
marvelling
the
while
at
his
complacence
and
at
the
dinner
where
with
their
womankind
were
half
a
dozen
of
those
that
sat
in
high
places
and
where
martin
found
himself
quite
the
lion
judge
blount
warmly
seconded
by
judge
hanwell
urged
privately
that
martin
should
permit
his
name
to
be
put
up
for
the
club
to
which
belonged
not
the
mere
men
of
wealth
but
the
men
of
attainment
and
martin
declined
and
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
he
was
kept
busy
disposing
of
his
heap
of
manuscripts
he
was
overwhelmed
by
requests
from
editors
it
had
been
discovered
that
he
was
a
stylist
with
meat
under
his
style
northern
after
publishing
cradle
of
beauty
had
written
him
for
half
a
dozen
similar
essays
which
would
have
been
supplied
out
of
the
heap
had
not
in
a
speculative
mood
offered
him
five
hundred
dollars
each
for
five
essays
he
wrote
back
that
he
would
supply
the
demand
but
at
a
thousand
dollars
an
essay
he
remembered
that
all
these
manuscripts
had
been
refused
by
the
very
magazines
that
were
now
clamoring
for
them
and
their
refusals
had
been
automatic
stereotyped
they
had
made
him
sweat
and
now
he
intended
to
make
them
sweat
paid
his
price
for
five
essays
and
the
remaining
four
at
the
same
rate
were
snapped
up
by
monthly
the
northern
being
too
poor
to
stand
the
pace
thus
went
out
to
the
world
high
priests
of
mystery
yardstick
of
the
ego
of
illusion
and
clod
and
biology
and
and
dignity
of
usury
raise
storms
and
rumblings
and
mutterings
that
were
many
a
day
in
dying
down
editors
wrote
to
him
telling
him
to
name
his
own
terms
which
he
did
but
it
was
always
for
work
performed
he
refused
resolutely
to
pledge
himself
to
any
new
thing
the
thought
of
again
setting
pen
to
paper
maddened
him
he
had
seen
brissenden
torn
to
pieces
by
the
crowd
and
despite
the
fact
that
him
the
crowd
acclaimed
he
could
not
get
over
the
shock
nor
gather
any
respect
for
the
crowd
his
very
popularity
seemed
a
disgrace
and
a
treason
to
brissenden
it
made
him
wince
but
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
on
and
fill
the
he
received
letters
from
editors
like
the
following
a
year
ago
we
were
unfortunate
enough
to
refuse
your
collection
of
we
were
greatly
impressed
by
them
at
the
time
but
certain
arrangements
already
entered
into
prevented
our
taking
them
if
you
still
have
them
and
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
forward
them
we
shall
be
glad
to
publish
the
entire
collection
on
your
own
terms
we
are
also
prepared
to
make
a
most
advantageous
offer
for
bringing
them
out
in
martin
recollected
his
tragedy
and
sent
it
instead
he
read
it
over
before
mailing
and
was
particularly
impressed
by
its
sophomoric
amateurishness
and
general
worthlessness
but
he
sent
it
and
it
was
published
to
the
everlasting
regret
of
the
editor
the
public
was
indignant
and
incredulous
it
was
too
far
a
cry
from
martin
high
standard
to
that
serious
bosh
it
was
asserted
that
he
had
never
written
it
that
the
magazine
had
faked
it
very
clumsily
or
that
martin
eden
was
emulating
the
elder
dumas
and
at
the
height
of
success
was
hiring
his
writing
done
for
him
but
when
he
explained
that
the
tragedy
was
an
early
effort
of
his
literary
childhood
and
that
the
magazine
had
refused
to
be
happy
unless
it
got
it
a
great
laugh
went
up
at
the
expense
and
a
change
in
the
editorship
followed
the
tragedy
was
never
brought
out
in
though
martin
pocketed
the
advance
royalties
that
had
been
paid
sent
martin
a
lengthy
telegram
costing
nearly
three
hundred
dollars
offering
him
a
thousand
dollars
an
article
for
twenty
articles
he
was
to
travel
over
the
united
states
with
all
expenses
paid
and
select
whatever
topics
interested
him
the
body
of
the
telegram
was
devoted
to
hypothetical
topics
in
order
to
show
him
the
freedom
of
range
that
was
to
be
his
the
only
restriction
placed
upon
him
was
that
he
must
confine
himself
to
the
united
states
martin
sent
his
inability
to
accept
and
his
regrets
by
wire
published
in
was
an
instantaneous
success
it
was
brought
out
forward
in
a
beautifully
decorated
volume
that
struck
the
holiday
trade
and
sold
like
wildfire
the
critics
were
unanimous
in
the
belief
that
it
would
take
its
place
with
those
two
classics
by
two
great
writers
bottle
and
magic
the
public
however
received
the
of
collection
rather
dubiously
and
coldly
the
audacity
and
unconventionality
of
the
storiettes
was
a
shock
to
bourgeois
morality
and
prejudice
but
when
paris
went
mad
over
the
immediate
translation
that
was
made
the
american
and
english
reading
public
followed
suit
and
bought
so
many
copies
that
martin
compelled
the
conservative
house
of
singletree
darnley
to
pay
a
flat
royalty
of
per
cent
for
a
third
book
and
thirty
per
cent
flat
for
a
fourth
these
two
volumes
comprised
all
the
short
stories
he
had
written
and
which
had
received
or
were
receiving
serial
publication
ring
of
and
his
horror
stories
constituted
one
collection
the
other
collection
was
composed
of
pot
wine
of
life
whirlpool
jostling
street
and
four
other
stories
the
company
captured
the
collection
of
all
his
essays
and
the
maxmillian
company
got
his
and
the
the
latter
receiving
serial
publication
in
the
home
after
the
payment
of
an
extortionate
price
martin
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
had
disposed
of
the
last
manuscript
the
castle
and
the
white
coppered
schooner
were
very
near
to
him
well
at
any
rate
he
had
discovered
contention
that
nothing
of
merit
found
its
way
into
the
magazines
his
own
success
demonstrated
that
brissenden
had
been
wrong
and
yet
somehow
he
had
a
feeling
that
brissenden
had
been
right
after
all
shame
of
the
had
been
the
cause
of
his
success
more
than
the
stuff
he
had
written
that
stuff
had
been
merely
incidental
it
had
been
rejected
right
and
left
by
the
magazines
the
publication
of
shame
of
the
had
started
a
controversy
and
precipitated
the
landslide
in
his
favor
had
there
been
no
of
the
there
would
have
been
no
landslide
and
had
there
been
no
miracle
in
the
go
of
shame
of
the
there
would
have
been
no
landslide
singletree
darnley
attested
that
miracle
they
had
brought
out
a
first
edition
of
fifteen
hundred
copies
and
been
dubious
of
selling
it
they
were
experienced
publishers
and
no
one
had
been
more
astounded
than
they
at
the
success
which
had
followed
to
them
it
had
been
in
truth
a
miracle
they
never
got
over
it
and
every
letter
they
wrote
him
reflected
their
reverent
awe
of
that
first
mysterious
happening
they
did
not
attempt
to
explain
it
there
was
no
explaining
it
it
had
happened
in
the
face
of
all
experience
to
the
contrary
it
had
happened
so
it
was
reasoning
thus
that
martin
questioned
the
validity
of
his
popularity
it
was
the
bourgeoisie
that
bought
his
books
and
poured
its
gold
into
his
and
from
what
little
he
knew
of
the
bourgeoisie
it
was
not
clear
to
him
how
it
could
possibly
appreciate
or
comprehend
what
he
had
written
his
intrinsic
beauty
and
power
meant
nothing
to
the
hundreds
of
thousands
who
were
acclaiming
him
and
buying
his
books
he
was
the
fad
of
the
hour
the
adventurer
who
had
stormed
parnassus
while
the
gods
nodded
the
hundreds
of
thousands
read
him
and
acclaimed
him
with
the
same
brute
with
which
they
had
flung
themselves
on
and
torn
it
to
that
fawned
on
him
instead
of
fanging
him
fawn
or
fang
it
was
all
a
matter
of
chance
one
thing
he
knew
with
absolute
certitude
was
infinitely
greater
than
anything
he
had
done
it
was
infinitely
greater
than
anything
he
had
in
him
it
was
a
poem
of
centuries
then
the
tribute
the
mob
paid
him
was
a
sorry
tribute
indeed
for
that
same
mob
had
wallowed
into
the
mire
he
sighed
heavily
and
with
satisfaction
he
was
glad
the
last
manuscript
was
sold
and
that
he
would
soon
be
done
with
it
all
chapter
xliv
morse
met
martin
in
the
office
of
the
hotel
metropole
whether
he
had
happened
there
just
casually
intent
on
other
affairs
or
whether
he
had
come
there
for
the
direct
purpose
of
inviting
him
to
dinner
martin
never
could
quite
make
up
his
mind
though
he
inclined
toward
the
second
hypothesis
at
any
rate
invited
to
dinner
he
was
by
father
who
had
forbidden
him
the
house
and
broken
off
the
engagement
martin
was
not
angry
he
was
not
even
on
his
dignity
he
tolerated
morse
wondering
the
while
how
it
felt
to
eat
such
humble
pie
he
did
not
decline
the
invitation
instead
he
put
it
off
with
vagueness
and
indefiniteness
and
inquired
after
the
family
particularly
after
morse
and
ruth
he
spoke
her
name
without
hesitancy
naturally
though
secretly
surprised
that
he
had
had
no
inward
quiver
no
old
familiar
increase
of
pulse
and
warm
surge
of
blood
he
had
many
invitations
to
dinner
some
of
which
he
accepted
persons
got
themselves
introduced
to
him
in
order
to
invite
him
to
dinner
and
he
went
on
puzzling
over
the
little
thing
that
was
becoming
a
great
thing
bernard
higginbotham
invited
him
to
dinner
he
puzzled
the
harder
he
remembered
the
days
of
his
desperate
starvation
when
no
one
invited
him
to
dinner
that
was
the
time
he
needed
dinners
and
went
weak
and
faint
for
lack
of
them
and
lost
weight
from
sheer
famine
that
was
the
paradox
of
it
when
he
wanted
dinners
no
one
gave
them
to
him
and
now
that
he
could
buy
a
hundred
thousand
dinners
and
was
losing
his
appetite
dinners
were
thrust
upon
him
right
and
left
but
why
there
was
no
justice
in
it
no
merit
on
his
part
he
was
no
different
all
the
work
he
had
done
was
even
at
that
time
work
performed
and
morse
had
condemned
him
for
an
idler
and
a
shirk
and
through
ruth
had
urged
that
he
take
a
position
in
an
office
furthermore
they
had
been
aware
of
his
work
performed
manuscript
after
manuscript
of
his
had
been
turned
over
to
them
by
ruth
they
had
read
them
it
was
the
very
same
work
that
had
put
his
name
in
all
the
papers
and
it
was
his
name
being
in
all
the
papers
that
led
them
to
invite
him
one
thing
was
certain
the
morses
had
not
cared
to
have
him
for
himself
or
for
his
work
therefore
they
could
not
want
him
now
for
himself
or
for
his
work
but
for
the
fame
that
was
his
because
he
was
somebody
amongst
men
not
he
had
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
or
so
that
was
the
way
bourgeois
society
valued
a
man
and
who
was
he
to
expect
it
otherwise
but
he
was
proud
he
disdained
such
valuation
he
desired
to
be
valued
for
himself
or
for
his
work
which
after
all
was
an
expression
of
himself
that
was
the
way
lizzie
valued
him
the
work
with
her
did
not
even
count
she
valued
him
himself
that
was
the
way
jimmy
the
plumber
and
all
the
old
gang
valued
him
that
had
been
proved
often
enough
in
the
days
when
he
ran
with
them
it
had
been
proved
that
sunday
at
shell
mound
park
his
work
could
go
hang
what
they
liked
and
were
willing
to
scrap
for
was
just
mart
eden
one
of
the
bunch
and
a
pretty
good
guy
then
there
was
ruth
she
had
liked
him
for
himself
that
was
indisputable
and
yet
much
as
she
had
liked
him
she
had
liked
the
bourgeois
standard
of
valuation
more
she
had
opposed
his
writing
and
principally
it
seemed
to
him
because
it
did
not
earn
money
that
had
been
her
criticism
of
his
she
too
had
urged
him
to
get
a
job
it
was
true
she
refined
it
to
but
it
meant
the
same
thing
and
in
his
own
mind
the
old
nomenclature
stuck
he
had
read
her
all
that
he
stories
shame
of
the
sun
everything
and
she
had
always
and
consistently
urged
him
to
get
a
job
to
go
to
god
if
he
been
working
robbing
sleep
exhausting
life
in
order
to
be
worthy
of
her
so
the
little
thing
grew
bigger
he
was
healthy
and
normal
ate
regularly
slept
long
hours
and
yet
the
growing
little
thing
was
becoming
an
obsession
the
phrase
haunted
his
brain
he
sat
opposite
bernard
higginbotham
at
a
heavy
sunday
dinner
over
cash
store
and
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
restrain
himself
from
shouting
out
was
work
performed
and
now
you
feed
me
when
then
you
let
me
starve
forbade
me
your
house
and
damned
me
because
i
get
a
job
and
the
work
was
already
done
all
done
and
now
when
i
speak
you
check
the
thought
unuttered
on
your
lips
and
hang
on
my
lips
and
pay
respectful
attention
to
whatever
i
choose
to
say
i
tell
you
your
party
is
rotten
and
filled
with
grafters
and
instead
of
flying
into
a
rage
you
hum
and
haw
and
admit
there
is
a
great
deal
in
what
i
say
and
why
because
famous
because
a
lot
of
money
not
because
martin
eden
a
pretty
good
fellow
and
not
particularly
a
fool
i
could
tell
you
the
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese
and
you
would
subscribe
to
the
notion
at
least
you
would
not
repudiate
it
because
got
dollars
mountains
of
them
and
it
was
all
done
long
ago
it
was
work
performed
i
tell
you
when
you
spat
upon
me
as
the
dirt
under
your
but
martin
did
not
shout
out
the
thought
gnawed
in
his
brain
an
unceasing
torment
while
he
smiled
and
succeeded
in
being
tolerant
as
he
grew
silent
bernard
higginbotham
got
the
reins
and
did
the
talking
he
was
a
success
himself
and
proud
of
it
he
was
no
one
had
helped
him
he
owed
no
man
he
was
fulfilling
his
duty
as
a
citizen
and
bringing
up
a
large
family
and
there
was
cash
store
that
monument
of
his
own
industry
and
ability
he
loved
cash
store
as
some
men
loved
their
wives
he
opened
up
his
heart
to
martin
showed
with
what
keenness
and
with
what
enormous
planning
he
had
made
the
store
and
he
had
plans
for
it
ambitious
plans
the
neighborhood
was
growing
up
fast
the
store
was
really
too
small
if
he
had
more
room
he
would
be
able
to
put
in
a
score
of
and
improvements
and
he
would
do
it
yet
he
was
straining
every
effort
for
the
day
when
he
could
buy
the
adjoining
lot
and
put
up
another
frame
building
the
upstairs
he
could
rent
and
the
whole
of
both
buildings
would
be
cash
store
his
eyes
glistened
when
he
spoke
of
the
new
sign
that
would
stretch
clear
across
both
buildings
martin
forgot
to
listen
the
refrain
of
performed
in
his
own
brain
was
drowning
the
clatter
the
refrain
maddened
him
and
he
tried
to
escape
from
it
much
did
you
say
it
would
cost
he
asked
suddenly
his
paused
in
the
middle
of
an
expatiation
on
the
business
opportunities
of
the
neighborhood
he
said
how
much
it
would
cost
but
he
knew
he
had
figured
it
out
a
score
of
times
the
way
lumber
is
now
he
said
thousand
could
do
the
sign
count
on
that
just
have
to
come
the
was
the
ground
thousand
he
leaned
forward
licking
his
lips
nervously
spreading
and
closing
his
fingers
while
he
watched
martin
write
a
check
when
it
was
passed
over
to
him
he
glanced
at
the
thousand
dollars
afford
to
pay
more
than
six
per
cent
he
said
huskily
martin
wanted
to
laugh
but
instead
demanded
much
would
that
be
lem
me
see
six
per
times
hundred
would
be
dollars
a
month
it
higginbotham
nodded
if
no
objection
arrange
it
this
martin
glanced
at
gertrude
can
have
the
principal
to
keep
for
yourself
if
use
the
dollars
a
month
for
cooking
and
washing
and
scrubbing
the
seven
thousand
is
yours
if
guarantee
that
gertrude
does
no
more
drudgery
is
it
a
go
higginbotham
swallowed
hard
that
his
wife
should
do
no
more
housework
was
an
affront
to
his
thrifty
soul
the
magnificent
present
was
the
coating
of
a
pill
a
bitter
pill
that
his
wife
should
not
work
it
gagged
him
right
then
martin
said
pay
the
a
month
he
reached
across
the
table
for
the
check
but
bernard
higginbotham
got
his
hand
on
it
first
crying
accept
i
accept
when
martin
got
on
the
electric
car
he
was
very
sick
and
tired
he
looked
up
at
the
assertive
sign
swine
he
groaned
swine
the
when
published
palmist
featuring
it
with
decorations
by
berthier
and
with
two
pictures
by
wenn
hermann
von
schmidt
forgot
that
he
had
called
the
verses
obscene
he
announced
that
his
wife
had
inspired
the
poem
saw
to
it
that
the
news
reached
the
ears
of
a
reporter
and
submitted
to
an
interview
by
a
staff
writer
who
was
accompanied
by
a
staff
photographer
and
a
staff
artist
the
result
was
a
full
page
in
a
sunday
supplement
filled
with
photographs
and
idealized
drawings
of
marian
with
many
intimate
details
of
martin
eden
and
his
family
and
with
the
full
text
of
in
large
type
and
republished
by
special
permission
of
it
caused
quite
a
stir
in
the
neighborhood
and
good
housewives
were
proud
to
have
the
acquaintances
of
the
great
sister
while
those
who
had
not
made
haste
to
cultivate
it
hermann
von
schmidt
chuckled
in
his
little
repair
shop
and
decided
to
order
a
new
lathe
than
advertising
he
told
marian
it
costs
better
have
him
to
dinner
she
suggested
and
to
dinner
martin
came
making
himself
agreeable
with
the
fat
wholesale
butcher
and
his
fatter
folk
they
likely
to
be
of
use
to
a
rising
young
man
like
hermann
von
schmidt
no
less
a
bait
however
had
been
required
to
draw
them
to
his
house
than
his
great
another
man
at
table
who
had
swallowed
the
same
bait
was
the
superintendent
of
the
pacific
coast
agencies
for
the
asa
bicycle
company
him
von
schmidt
desired
to
please
and
propitiate
because
from
him
could
be
obtained
the
oakland
agency
for
the
bicycle
so
hermann
von
schmidt
found
it
a
goodly
asset
to
have
martin
for
a
but
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
understand
where
it
all
came
in
in
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
while
his
wife
slept
he
had
floundered
through
books
and
poems
and
decided
that
the
world
was
a
fool
to
buy
them
and
in
his
heart
of
hearts
martin
understood
the
situation
only
too
well
as
he
leaned
back
and
gloated
at
von
head
in
fancy
punching
it
off
of
him
sending
blow
after
blow
home
just
dutchman
one
thing
he
did
like
about
him
however
poor
as
he
was
and
determined
to
rise
as
he
was
he
nevertheless
hired
one
servant
to
take
the
heavy
work
off
of
hands
martin
talked
with
the
superintendent
of
the
asa
agencies
and
after
dinner
he
drew
him
aside
with
hermann
whom
he
backed
financially
for
the
best
bicycle
store
with
fittings
in
oakland
he
went
further
and
in
a
private
talk
with
hermann
told
him
to
keep
his
eyes
open
for
an
automobile
agency
and
garage
for
there
was
no
reason
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
run
both
establishments
successfully
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
her
arms
around
his
neck
marian
at
parting
told
martin
how
much
she
loved
him
and
always
had
loved
him
it
was
true
there
was
a
perceptible
halt
midway
in
her
assertion
which
she
glossed
over
with
more
tears
and
kisses
and
incoherent
stammerings
and
which
martin
inferred
to
be
her
appeal
for
forgiveness
for
the
time
she
had
lacked
faith
in
him
and
insisted
on
his
getting
a
job
never
keep
his
money
sure
hermann
von
schmidt
confided
to
his
wife
got
mad
when
i
spoke
of
interest
he
said
damn
the
principal
and
if
i
mentioned
it
again
punch
my
dutch
head
off
what
he
dutch
head
but
all
right
even
if
he
no
business
man
given
me
my
chance
all
invitations
to
dinner
poured
in
on
martin
and
the
more
they
poured
the
more
he
puzzled
he
sat
the
guest
of
honor
at
an
arden
club
banquet
with
men
of
note
whom
he
had
heard
about
and
read
about
all
his
life
and
they
told
him
how
when
they
had
read
ring
of
in
the
and
peri
and
the
in
they
had
immediately
picked
him
for
a
winner
my
god
and
i
was
hungry
and
in
rags
he
thought
to
himself
why
you
give
me
a
dinner
then
then
was
the
time
it
was
work
performed
if
you
are
feeding
me
now
for
work
performed
why
did
you
not
feed
me
then
when
i
needed
it
not
one
word
in
ring
of
bells
nor
in
peri
and
the
has
been
changed
no
not
feeding
me
now
for
work
performed
you
are
feeding
me
because
everybody
else
is
feeding
me
and
because
it
is
an
honor
to
feed
me
you
are
feeding
me
now
because
you
are
herd
animals
because
you
are
part
of
the
mob
because
the
one
blind
automatic
thought
in
the
just
now
is
to
feed
me
and
where
does
martin
eden
and
the
work
martin
eden
performed
come
in
in
all
this
he
asked
himself
plaintively
then
arose
to
respond
cleverly
and
wittily
to
a
clever
and
witty
toast
so
it
went
wherever
he
happened
to
the
press
club
at
the
redwood
club
at
pink
teas
and
literary
were
remembered
ring
of
and
peri
and
the
when
they
were
first
published
and
always
was
maddening
and
unuttered
demand
why
you
feed
me
then
it
was
work
performed
ring
of
and
peri
and
the
are
not
changed
one
iota
they
were
just
as
artistic
just
as
worth
while
then
as
now
but
you
are
not
feeding
me
for
their
sake
nor
for
the
sake
of
anything
else
i
have
written
feeding
me
because
it
is
the
style
of
feeding
just
now
because
the
whole
mob
is
crazy
with
the
idea
of
feeding
martin
eden
and
often
at
such
times
he
would
abruptly
see
slouch
in
among
the
company
a
young
hoodlum
in
coat
and
under
a
stetson
hat
it
happened
to
him
at
the
gallina
society
in
oakland
one
afternoon
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
stepped
forward
across
the
platform
he
saw
stalk
through
the
wide
door
at
the
rear
of
the
great
room
the
young
hoodlum
with
the
coat
and
hat
five
hundred
fashionably
gowned
women
turned
their
heads
so
intent
and
steadfast
was
gaze
to
see
what
he
was
seeing
but
they
saw
only
the
empty
centre
aisle
he
saw
the
young
tough
lurching
down
that
aisle
and
wondered
if
he
would
remove
the
which
never
yet
had
he
seen
him
without
straight
down
the
aisle
he
came
and
up
the
platform
martin
could
have
wept
over
that
youthful
shade
of
himself
when
he
thought
of
all
that
lay
before
him
across
the
platform
he
swaggered
right
up
to
martin
and
into
the
foreground
of
consciousness
disappeared
the
five
hundred
women
applauded
softly
with
gloved
hands
seeking
to
encourage
the
bashful
great
man
who
was
their
guest
and
martin
shook
the
vision
from
his
brain
smiled
and
began
to
speak
the
superintendent
of
schools
good
old
man
stopped
martin
on
the
street
and
remembered
him
recalling
seances
in
his
office
when
martin
was
expelled
from
school
for
fighting
read
your
of
in
one
of
the
magazines
quite
a
time
ago
he
said
was
as
good
as
poe
splendid
i
said
at
the
time
splendid
yes
and
twice
in
the
months
that
followed
you
passed
me
on
the
street
and
did
not
know
me
martin
almost
said
aloud
each
time
i
was
hungry
and
heading
for
the
pawnbroker
yet
it
was
work
performed
you
did
not
know
me
then
why
do
you
know
me
now
was
remarking
to
my
wife
only
the
other
day
the
other
was
saying
it
be
a
good
idea
to
have
you
out
to
dinner
some
time
and
she
quite
agreed
with
me
yes
she
quite
agreed
with
martin
said
so
sharply
that
it
was
almost
a
snarl
yes
yes
dinner
you
pot
luck
with
us
with
your
old
superintendent
you
rascal
he
uttered
nervously
poking
martin
in
an
attempt
at
jocular
fellowship
martin
went
down
the
street
in
a
daze
he
stopped
at
the
corner
and
looked
about
him
vacantly
be
damned
he
murmured
at
last
old
fellow
was
afraid
of
chapter
xlv
kreis
came
to
martin
one
of
the
and
martin
turned
to
him
with
relief
to
receive
the
glowing
details
of
a
scheme
sufficiently
to
interest
him
as
a
fictionist
rather
than
an
investor
kreis
paused
long
enough
in
the
midst
of
his
exposition
to
tell
him
that
in
most
of
his
of
the
he
had
been
a
chump
i
come
here
to
spout
philosophy
kreis
went
on
i
want
to
know
is
whether
or
not
you
will
put
a
thousand
dollars
in
on
this
deal
not
chump
enough
for
that
at
any
rate
martin
answered
tell
you
what
i
will
do
you
gave
me
the
greatest
night
of
my
life
you
gave
me
what
money
can
not
buy
now
got
money
and
it
means
nothing
to
me
like
to
turn
over
to
you
a
thousand
dollars
of
what
i
value
for
what
you
gave
me
that
night
and
which
was
beyond
price
you
need
the
money
got
more
than
i
need
you
want
it
you
came
for
it
no
use
scheming
it
out
of
me
take
kreis
betrayed
no
surprise
he
folded
the
check
away
in
his
pocket
that
rate
like
the
contract
of
providing
you
with
many
such
nights
he
said
martin
shook
his
head
night
was
the
one
night
for
me
i
was
in
paradise
commonplace
with
you
i
know
but
it
to
me
i
shall
never
live
at
such
a
pitch
again
done
with
philosophy
i
want
never
to
hear
another
word
of
first
dollar
i
ever
made
in
my
life
out
of
my
philosophy
kreis
remarked
as
he
paused
in
the
doorway
then
the
market
morse
drove
by
martin
on
the
street
one
day
and
smiled
and
nodded
he
smiled
back
and
lifted
his
hat
the
episode
did
not
affect
him
a
month
before
it
might
have
disgusted
him
or
made
him
curious
and
set
him
to
speculating
about
her
state
of
consciousness
at
that
moment
but
now
it
was
not
provocative
of
a
second
thought
he
forgot
about
it
the
next
moment
he
forgot
about
it
as
he
would
have
forgotten
the
central
bank
building
or
the
city
hall
after
having
walked
past
them
yet
his
mind
was
preternaturally
active
his
thoughts
went
ever
around
and
around
in
a
circle
the
centre
of
that
circle
was
it
ate
at
his
brain
like
a
deathless
maggot
he
awoke
to
it
in
the
morning
it
tormented
his
dreams
at
night
every
affair
of
life
around
him
that
penetrated
through
his
senses
immediately
related
itself
to
he
drove
along
the
path
of
relentless
logic
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
nobody
nothing
mart
eden
the
hoodlum
and
mart
eden
the
sailor
had
been
real
had
been
he
but
martin
eden
the
famous
writer
did
not
exist
martin
eden
the
famous
writer
was
a
vapor
that
had
arisen
in
the
and
by
the
had
been
thrust
into
the
corporeal
being
of
mart
eden
the
hoodlum
and
sailor
but
it
fool
him
he
was
not
that
that
the
mob
was
worshipping
and
sacrificing
dinners
to
he
knew
better
he
read
the
magazines
about
himself
and
pored
over
portraits
of
himself
published
therein
until
he
was
unable
to
associate
his
identity
with
those
portraits
he
was
the
fellow
who
had
lived
and
thrilled
and
loved
who
had
been
and
tolerant
of
the
frailties
of
life
who
had
served
in
the
forecastle
wandered
in
strange
lands
and
led
his
gang
in
the
old
fighting
days
he
was
the
fellow
who
had
been
stunned
at
first
by
the
thousands
of
books
in
the
free
library
and
who
had
afterward
learned
his
way
among
them
and
mastered
them
he
was
the
fellow
who
had
burned
the
midnight
oil
and
bedded
with
a
spur
and
written
books
himself
but
the
one
thing
he
was
not
was
that
colossal
appetite
that
all
the
mob
was
bent
upon
feeding
there
were
things
however
in
the
magazines
that
amused
him
all
the
magazines
were
claiming
him
advertised
to
its
subscribers
that
it
was
always
on
the
quest
after
new
writers
and
that
among
others
it
had
introduced
martin
eden
to
the
reading
public
white
claimed
him
so
did
northern
and
until
silenced
by
which
pointed
triumphantly
to
its
files
where
the
mangled
lay
buried
and
which
had
come
to
life
again
after
having
escaped
paying
its
bills
put
in
a
prior
claim
which
nobody
but
children
ever
read
the
made
a
dignified
and
convincing
statement
of
how
it
first
discovered
martin
eden
which
was
warmly
disputed
by
with
the
exhibit
of
peri
and
the
the
modest
claim
of
singletree
darnley
was
lost
in
the
din
besides
that
publishing
firm
did
not
own
a
magazine
wherewith
to
make
its
claim
less
modest
the
newspapers
calculated
royalties
in
some
way
the
magnificent
offers
certain
magazines
had
made
him
leaked
out
and
oakland
ministers
called
upon
him
in
a
friendly
way
while
professional
begging
letters
began
to
clutter
his
mail
but
worse
than
all
this
were
the
women
his
photographs
were
published
broadcast
and
special
writers
exploited
his
strong
bronzed
face
his
scars
his
heavy
shoulders
his
clear
quiet
eyes
and
the
slight
hollows
in
his
cheeks
like
an
at
this
last
he
remembered
his
wild
youth
and
smiled
often
among
the
women
he
met
he
would
see
now
one
now
another
looking
at
him
appraising
him
selecting
him
he
laughed
to
himself
he
remembered
warning
and
laughed
again
the
women
would
never
destroy
him
that
much
was
certain
he
had
gone
past
that
stage
once
walking
with
lizzie
toward
night
school
she
caught
a
glance
directed
toward
him
by
a
handsome
woman
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
glance
was
a
trifle
too
long
a
shade
too
considerative
lizzie
knew
it
for
what
it
was
and
her
body
tensed
angrily
martin
noticed
noticed
the
cause
of
it
told
her
how
used
he
was
becoming
to
it
and
that
he
did
not
care
anyway
ought
to
care
she
answered
with
blazing
eyes
sick
the
healthier
in
my
life
i
weigh
five
pounds
more
than
i
ever
your
body
your
head
wrong
with
your
even
i
can
see
that
i
he
walked
on
beside
her
reflecting
give
anything
to
see
you
get
over
it
she
broke
out
impulsively
ought
to
care
when
women
look
at
you
that
way
a
man
like
you
not
natural
all
right
enough
for
but
you
made
that
way
so
help
me
be
willing
glad
if
the
right
woman
came
along
made
you
when
he
left
lizzie
at
night
school
he
returned
to
the
metropole
once
in
his
rooms
he
dropped
into
a
morris
chair
and
sat
staring
straight
before
him
he
did
not
doze
nor
did
he
think
his
mind
was
a
blank
save
for
the
intervals
when
unsummoned
memory
pictures
took
form
and
color
and
radiance
just
under
his
eyelids
he
saw
these
pictures
but
he
was
scarcely
conscious
of
more
so
than
if
they
had
been
dreams
yet
he
was
not
asleep
once
he
roused
himself
and
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
just
eight
he
had
nothing
to
do
and
it
was
too
early
for
bed
then
his
mind
went
blank
again
and
the
pictures
began
to
form
and
vanish
under
his
eyelids
there
was
nothing
distinctive
about
the
pictures
they
were
always
masses
of
leaves
and
branches
shot
through
with
hot
sunshine
a
knock
at
the
door
aroused
him
he
was
not
asleep
and
his
mind
immediately
connected
the
knock
with
a
telegram
or
letter
or
perhaps
one
of
the
servants
bringing
back
clean
clothes
from
the
laundry
he
was
thinking
about
joe
and
wondering
where
he
was
as
he
said
he
was
still
thinking
about
joe
and
did
not
turn
toward
the
door
he
heard
it
close
softly
there
was
a
long
silence
he
forgot
that
there
had
been
a
knock
at
the
door
and
was
still
staring
blankly
before
him
when
he
heard
a
sob
it
was
involuntary
spasmodic
checked
and
noted
that
as
he
turned
about
the
next
instant
he
was
on
his
feet
he
said
amazed
and
bewildered
her
face
was
white
and
strained
she
stood
just
inside
the
door
one
hand
against
it
for
support
the
other
pressed
to
her
side
she
extended
both
hands
toward
him
piteously
and
started
forward
to
meet
him
as
he
caught
her
hands
and
led
her
to
the
morris
chair
he
noticed
how
cold
they
were
he
drew
up
another
chair
and
sat
down
on
the
broad
arm
of
it
he
was
too
confused
to
speak
in
his
own
mind
his
affair
with
ruth
was
closed
and
sealed
he
felt
much
in
the
same
way
that
he
would
have
felt
had
the
shelly
hot
springs
laundry
suddenly
invaded
the
hotel
metropole
with
a
whole
washing
ready
for
him
to
pitch
into
several
times
he
was
about
to
speak
and
each
time
he
hesitated
one
knows
i
am
here
ruth
said
in
a
faint
voice
with
an
appealing
smile
did
you
say
he
was
surprised
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
she
repeated
her
words
he
said
then
wondered
what
more
he
could
possibly
say
saw
you
come
in
and
i
waited
a
few
he
said
again
he
had
never
been
so
in
his
life
positively
he
did
not
have
an
idea
in
his
head
he
felt
stupid
and
awkward
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
it
would
have
been
easier
had
the
intrusion
been
the
shelly
hot
springs
laundry
he
could
have
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
gone
to
work
then
you
came
in
he
said
finally
she
nodded
with
a
slightly
arch
expression
and
loosened
the
scarf
at
her
throat
saw
you
first
from
across
the
street
when
you
were
with
that
yes
he
said
simply
took
her
down
to
night
you
glad
to
see
me
she
said
at
the
end
of
another
silence
he
spoke
hastily
it
rash
of
you
to
come
here
slipped
in
nobody
knows
i
am
here
i
wanted
to
see
you
i
came
to
tell
you
i
have
been
very
foolish
i
came
because
i
could
no
longer
stay
away
because
my
heart
compelled
me
to
come
i
wanted
to
she
came
forward
out
of
her
chair
and
over
to
him
she
rested
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
a
moment
breathing
quickly
and
then
slipped
into
his
arms
and
in
his
large
easy
way
desirous
of
not
inflicting
hurt
knowing
that
to
repulse
this
proffer
of
herself
was
to
inflict
the
most
grievous
hurt
a
woman
could
receive
he
folded
his
arms
around
her
and
held
her
close
but
there
was
no
warmth
in
the
embrace
no
caress
in
the
contact
she
had
come
into
his
arms
and
he
held
her
that
was
all
she
nestled
against
him
and
then
with
a
change
of
position
her
hands
crept
up
and
rested
upon
his
neck
but
his
flesh
was
not
fire
beneath
those
hands
and
he
felt
awkward
and
uncomfortable
makes
you
tremble
so
he
asked
it
a
chill
shall
i
light
the
grate
he
made
a
movement
to
disengage
himself
but
she
clung
more
closely
to
him
shivering
violently
is
merely
nervousness
she
said
with
chattering
teeth
control
myself
in
a
minute
there
i
am
better
slowly
her
shivering
died
away
he
continued
to
hold
her
but
he
was
no
longer
puzzled
he
knew
now
for
what
she
had
come
mother
wanted
me
to
marry
charley
hapgood
she
announced
hapgood
that
fellow
who
speaks
always
in
platitudes
martin
groaned
then
he
added
now
i
suppose
your
mother
wants
you
to
marry
he
did
not
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
question
he
stated
it
as
a
certitude
and
before
his
eyes
began
to
dance
the
rows
of
figures
of
his
royalties
will
not
object
i
know
that
much
ruth
said
considers
me
quite
eligible
ruth
nodded
yet
i
am
not
a
bit
more
eligible
now
than
i
was
when
she
broke
our
engagement
he
meditated
changed
any
the
same
martin
eden
though
for
that
matter
a
bit
smoke
now
you
smell
my
breath
in
reply
she
pressed
her
open
fingers
against
his
lips
placed
them
graciously
and
playfully
and
in
expectancy
of
the
kiss
that
of
old
had
always
been
a
consequence
but
there
was
no
caressing
answer
of
lips
he
waited
until
the
fingers
were
removed
and
then
went
on
am
not
changed
i
got
a
job
not
looking
for
a
job
furthermore
i
am
not
going
to
look
for
a
job
and
i
still
believe
that
herbert
spencer
is
a
great
and
noble
man
and
that
judge
blount
is
an
unmitigated
ass
i
had
dinner
with
him
the
other
night
so
i
ought
to
you
accept
invitation
she
chided
you
know
about
that
who
sent
him
your
mother
she
remained
silent
she
did
send
him
i
thought
so
and
now
i
suppose
she
has
sent
one
knows
that
i
am
here
she
protested
you
think
my
mother
would
permit
this
permit
you
to
marry
me
she
gave
a
sharp
cry
martin
be
cruel
you
have
not
kissed
me
once
you
are
as
unresponsive
as
a
stone
and
think
what
i
have
dared
to
she
looked
about
her
with
a
shiver
though
half
the
look
was
curiosity
think
of
where
i
could
die
for
you
i
could
die
for
words
were
ringing
in
his
ears
you
dare
it
before
he
asked
harshly
i
a
job
when
i
was
starving
when
i
was
just
as
i
am
now
as
a
man
as
an
artist
the
same
martin
eden
the
question
been
propounding
to
myself
for
many
a
concerning
you
merely
but
concerning
everybody
you
see
i
have
not
changed
though
my
sudden
apparent
appreciation
in
value
compels
me
constantly
to
reassure
myself
on
that
point
got
the
same
flesh
on
my
bones
the
same
ten
fingers
and
toes
i
am
the
same
i
have
not
developed
any
new
strength
nor
virtue
my
brain
is
the
same
old
brain
i
made
even
one
new
generalization
on
literature
or
philosophy
i
am
personally
of
the
same
value
that
i
was
when
nobody
wanted
me
and
what
is
puzzling
me
is
why
they
want
me
now
surely
they
want
me
for
myself
for
myself
is
the
same
old
self
they
did
not
want
then
they
must
want
me
for
something
else
for
something
that
is
outside
of
me
for
something
that
is
not
i
shall
i
tell
you
what
that
something
is
it
is
for
the
recognition
i
have
received
that
recognition
is
not
i
it
resides
in
the
minds
of
others
then
again
for
the
money
i
have
earned
and
am
earning
but
that
money
is
not
i
it
resides
in
banks
and
in
the
pockets
of
tom
dick
and
harry
and
is
it
for
that
for
the
recognition
and
the
money
that
you
now
want
me
are
breaking
my
heart
she
sobbed
know
i
love
you
that
i
am
here
because
i
love
am
afraid
you
see
my
point
he
said
gently
i
mean
is
if
you
love
me
how
does
it
happen
that
you
love
me
now
so
much
more
than
you
did
when
your
love
was
weak
enough
to
deny
me
and
forgive
she
cried
passionately
loved
you
all
the
time
remember
that
and
i
am
here
now
in
your
afraid
i
am
a
shrewd
merchant
peering
into
the
scales
trying
to
weigh
your
love
and
find
out
what
manner
of
thing
it
she
withdrew
herself
from
his
arms
sat
upright
and
looked
at
him
long
and
searchingly
she
was
about
to
speak
then
faltered
and
changed
her
mind
see
it
appears
this
way
to
me
he
went
on
i
was
all
that
i
am
now
nobody
out
of
my
own
class
seemed
to
care
for
me
when
my
books
were
all
written
no
one
who
had
read
the
manuscripts
seemed
to
care
for
them
in
point
of
fact
because
of
the
stuff
i
had
written
they
seemed
to
care
even
less
for
me
in
writing
the
stuff
it
seemed
that
i
had
committed
acts
that
were
to
say
the
least
derogatory
a
job
everybody
she
made
a
movement
of
dissent
yes
he
said
in
your
case
you
told
me
to
get
a
position
the
homely
word
like
much
that
i
have
written
offends
you
it
is
brutal
but
i
assure
you
it
was
no
less
brutal
to
me
when
everybody
i
knew
recommended
it
to
me
as
they
would
recommend
right
conduct
to
an
immoral
creature
but
to
return
the
publication
of
what
i
had
written
and
the
public
notice
i
received
wrought
a
change
in
the
fibre
of
your
love
martin
eden
with
his
work
all
performed
you
would
not
marry
your
love
for
him
was
not
strong
enough
to
enable
you
to
marry
him
but
your
love
is
now
strong
enough
and
i
can
not
avoid
the
conclusion
that
its
strength
arises
from
the
publication
and
the
public
notice
in
your
case
i
do
not
mention
royalties
though
i
am
certain
that
they
apply
to
the
change
wrought
in
your
mother
and
father
of
course
all
this
is
not
flattering
to
me
but
worst
of
all
it
makes
me
question
love
sacred
love
is
love
so
gross
a
thing
that
it
must
feed
upon
publication
and
public
notice
it
would
seem
so
i
have
sat
and
thought
upon
it
till
my
head
went
dear
she
reached
up
a
hand
and
passed
the
fingers
soothingly
through
his
hair
it
go
around
no
more
let
us
begin
anew
now
i
loved
you
all
the
time
i
know
that
i
was
weak
in
yielding
to
my
will
i
should
not
have
done
so
yet
i
have
heard
you
speak
so
often
with
broad
charity
of
the
fallibility
and
frailty
of
humankind
extend
that
charity
to
me
i
acted
mistakenly
forgive
i
do
forgive
he
said
impatiently
is
easy
to
forgive
where
there
is
really
nothing
to
forgive
nothing
that
you
have
done
requires
forgiveness
one
acts
according
to
lights
and
more
than
that
one
can
not
do
as
well
might
i
ask
you
to
forgive
me
for
my
not
getting
a
meant
well
she
protested
know
that
i
could
not
have
loved
you
and
not
meant
but
you
would
have
destroyed
me
out
of
your
yes
he
shut
off
her
attempted
objection
would
have
destroyed
my
writing
and
my
career
realism
is
imperative
to
my
nature
and
the
bourgeois
spirit
hates
realism
the
bourgeoisie
is
cowardly
it
is
afraid
of
life
and
all
your
effort
was
to
make
me
afraid
of
life
you
would
have
formalized
me
you
would
have
compressed
me
into
a
pigeonhole
of
life
where
all
values
are
unreal
and
false
and
he
felt
her
stir
protestingly
hearty
vulgarity
the
basis
of
bourgeois
refinement
and
culture
as
i
say
you
wanted
to
formalize
me
to
make
me
over
into
one
of
your
own
class
with
your
and
he
shook
his
head
sadly
you
do
not
understand
even
now
what
i
am
saying
my
words
do
not
mean
to
you
what
i
endeavor
to
make
them
mean
what
i
say
is
so
much
fantasy
to
you
yet
to
me
it
is
vital
reality
at
the
best
you
are
a
trifle
puzzled
and
amused
that
this
raw
boy
crawling
up
out
of
the
mire
of
the
abyss
should
pass
judgment
upon
your
class
and
call
it
she
leaned
her
head
wearily
against
his
shoulder
and
her
body
shivered
with
recurrent
nervousness
he
waited
for
a
time
for
her
to
speak
and
then
went
on
now
you
want
to
renew
our
love
you
want
us
to
be
married
you
want
me
and
yet
my
books
had
not
been
noticed
nevertheless
have
been
just
what
i
am
now
and
you
would
have
stayed
away
it
is
all
those
damned
swear
she
interrupted
her
reproof
startled
him
he
broke
into
a
harsh
laugh
it
he
said
a
high
moment
when
what
seems
your
happiness
is
at
stake
you
are
afraid
of
life
in
the
same
old
of
life
and
a
healthy
she
was
stung
by
his
words
into
realization
of
the
puerility
of
her
act
and
yet
she
felt
that
he
had
magnified
it
unduly
and
was
consequently
resentful
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
long
time
she
thinking
desperately
and
he
pondering
upon
his
love
which
had
departed
he
knew
now
that
he
had
not
really
loved
her
it
was
an
idealized
ruth
he
had
loved
an
ethereal
creature
of
his
own
creating
the
bright
and
luminous
spirit
of
his
the
real
bourgeois
ruth
with
all
the
bourgeois
failings
and
with
the
hopeless
cramp
of
the
bourgeois
psychology
in
her
mind
he
had
never
loved
she
suddenly
began
to
speak
know
that
much
you
have
said
is
so
i
have
been
afraid
of
life
i
did
not
love
you
well
enough
i
have
learned
to
love
better
i
love
you
for
what
you
are
for
what
you
were
for
the
ways
even
by
which
you
have
become
i
love
you
for
the
ways
wherein
you
differ
from
what
you
call
my
class
for
your
beliefs
which
i
do
not
understand
but
which
i
know
i
can
come
to
understand
i
shall
devote
myself
to
understanding
them
and
even
your
smoking
and
your
are
part
of
you
and
i
will
love
you
for
them
too
i
can
still
learn
in
the
last
ten
minutes
i
have
learned
much
that
i
have
dared
to
come
here
is
a
token
of
what
i
have
already
learned
oh
martin
she
was
sobbing
and
nestling
close
against
him
for
the
first
time
his
arms
folded
her
gently
and
with
sympathy
and
she
acknowledged
it
with
a
happy
movement
and
a
brightening
face
is
too
late
he
said
he
remembered
words
am
a
sick
not
my
body
it
is
my
soul
my
brain
i
seem
to
have
lost
all
values
i
care
for
nothing
if
you
had
been
this
way
a
few
months
ago
it
would
have
been
different
it
is
too
late
is
not
too
late
she
cried
will
show
you
i
will
prove
to
you
that
my
love
has
grown
that
it
is
greater
to
me
than
my
class
and
all
that
is
dearest
to
me
all
that
is
dearest
to
the
bourgeoisie
i
will
flout
i
am
no
longer
afraid
of
life
i
will
leave
my
father
and
mother
and
let
my
name
become
a
with
my
friends
i
will
come
to
you
here
and
now
in
free
love
if
you
will
and
i
will
be
proud
and
glad
to
be
with
you
if
i
have
been
a
traitor
to
love
i
will
now
for
sake
be
a
traitor
to
all
that
made
that
earlier
she
stood
before
him
with
shining
eyes
am
waiting
martin
she
whispered
for
you
to
accept
me
look
at
it
was
splendid
he
thought
looking
at
her
she
had
redeemed
herself
for
all
that
she
had
lacked
rising
up
at
last
true
woman
superior
to
the
iron
rule
of
bourgeois
convention
it
was
splendid
magnificent
desperate
and
yet
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
was
not
thrilled
nor
stirred
by
what
she
had
done
it
was
splendid
and
magnificent
only
intellectually
in
what
should
have
been
a
moment
of
fire
he
coldly
appraised
her
his
heart
was
untouched
he
was
unaware
of
any
desire
for
her
again
he
remembered
words
am
sick
very
sick
he
said
with
a
despairing
gesture
sick
i
did
not
know
till
now
something
has
gone
out
of
me
i
have
always
been
unafraid
of
life
but
i
never
dreamed
of
being
sated
with
life
life
has
so
filled
me
that
i
am
empty
of
any
desire
for
anything
if
there
were
room
i
should
want
you
now
you
see
how
sick
i
he
leaned
his
head
back
and
closed
his
eyes
and
like
a
child
crying
that
forgets
its
grief
in
watching
the
sunlight
percolate
through
the
films
over
the
pupils
so
martin
forgot
his
sickness
the
presence
of
ruth
everything
in
watching
the
masses
of
vegetation
shot
through
hotly
with
sunshine
that
took
form
and
blazed
against
this
background
of
his
eyelids
it
was
not
restful
that
green
foliage
the
sunlight
was
too
raw
and
glaring
it
hurt
him
to
look
at
it
and
yet
he
looked
he
knew
not
why
he
was
brought
back
to
himself
by
the
rattle
of
the
ruth
was
at
the
door
shall
i
get
out
she
questioned
tearfully
am
forgive
me
he
cried
springing
to
his
feet
not
myself
you
know
i
forgot
you
were
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
see
not
just
right
take
you
home
we
can
go
out
by
the
entrance
no
one
will
see
us
pull
down
that
veil
and
everything
will
be
all
she
clung
to
his
arm
through
the
passages
and
down
the
narrow
stairs
am
safe
now
she
said
when
they
emerged
on
the
sidewalk
at
the
same
time
starting
to
take
her
hand
from
his
arm
no
see
you
home
he
answered
please
she
objected
is
again
she
started
to
remove
her
hand
he
felt
a
momentary
curiosity
now
that
she
was
out
of
danger
she
was
afraid
she
was
in
almost
a
panic
to
be
quit
of
him
he
could
see
no
reason
for
it
and
attributed
it
to
her
nervousness
so
he
restrained
her
withdrawing
hand
and
started
to
walk
on
with
her
halfway
down
the
block
he
saw
a
man
in
a
long
overcoat
shrink
back
into
a
doorway
he
shot
a
glance
in
as
he
passed
by
and
despite
the
high
collar
he
was
certain
that
he
recognized
brother
norman
during
the
walk
ruth
and
martin
held
little
conversation
she
was
stunned
he
was
apathetic
once
he
mentioned
that
he
was
going
away
back
to
the
south
seas
and
once
she
asked
him
to
forgive
her
having
come
to
him
and
that
was
all
the
parting
at
her
door
was
conventional
they
shook
hands
said
good
night
and
he
lifted
his
hat
the
door
swung
shut
and
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
turned
back
for
his
hotel
when
he
came
to
the
doorway
into
which
he
had
seen
norman
shrink
he
stopped
and
looked
in
in
a
speculative
humor
lied
he
said
aloud
made
believe
to
me
that
she
had
dared
greatly
and
all
the
while
she
knew
the
brother
that
brought
her
was
waiting
to
take
her
he
burst
into
laughter
these
bourgeois
when
i
was
broke
i
was
not
fit
to
be
seen
with
his
sister
when
i
have
a
bank
account
he
brings
her
to
as
he
swung
on
his
heel
to
go
on
a
tramp
going
in
the
same
direction
begged
him
over
his
shoulder
mister
can
you
give
me
a
quarter
to
get
a
bed
were
the
words
but
it
was
the
voice
that
made
martin
turn
around
the
next
instant
he
had
joe
by
the
hand
remember
that
time
we
parted
at
the
hot
springs
the
other
was
saying
said
then
meet
again
i
felt
it
in
my
bones
here
we
looking
good
martin
said
admiringly
put
on
sure
face
was
beaming
never
knew
what
it
was
to
live
till
i
hit
thirty
pounds
heavier
feel
tiptop
all
the
time
why
i
was
worked
to
skin
bone
in
them
old
days
sure
agrees
with
looking
for
a
bed
just
the
same
martin
chided
a
cold
for
a
bed
joe
shot
a
hand
into
his
hip
pocket
and
brought
it
out
filled
with
small
change
beats
hard
graft
he
exulted
just
looked
good
why
i
battered
martin
laughed
and
gave
in
several
drunks
right
there
he
insinuated
joe
slid
the
money
back
into
his
pocket
in
mine
he
announced
oryide
for
me
though
there
to
stop
me
except
i
want
to
ben
drunk
once
since
i
seen
you
last
then
it
was
unexpected
on
an
empty
stomach
when
i
work
like
a
beast
i
drink
like
a
beast
when
i
live
like
a
man
i
drink
like
a
jolt
now
again
when
i
feel
like
it
martin
arranged
to
meet
him
next
day
and
went
on
to
the
hotel
he
paused
in
the
office
to
look
up
steamer
sailings
the
sailed
for
tahiti
in
five
days
over
and
reserve
a
stateroom
for
me
he
told
the
clerk
but
down
below
on
the
remember
that
the
better
write
it
once
in
his
room
he
got
into
bed
and
slipped
off
to
sleep
as
gently
as
a
child
the
occurrences
of
the
evening
had
made
no
impression
on
him
his
mind
was
dead
to
impressions
the
glow
of
warmth
with
which
he
met
joe
had
been
most
fleeting
the
succeeding
minute
he
had
been
bothered
by
the
presence
and
by
the
compulsion
of
conversation
that
in
five
more
days
he
sailed
for
his
loved
south
seas
meant
nothing
to
him
so
he
closed
his
eyes
and
slept
normally
and
comfortably
for
eight
uninterrupted
hours
he
was
not
restless
he
did
not
change
his
position
nor
did
he
dream
sleep
had
become
to
him
oblivion
and
each
day
that
he
awoke
he
awoke
with
regret
life
worried
and
bored
him
and
time
was
a
vexation
chapter
xlvi
joe
was
his
greeting
to
his
next
morning
a
frenchman
out
on
street
made
a
pot
of
money
and
going
back
to
france
a
dandy
small
steam
laundry
a
start
for
you
if
you
want
to
settle
down
here
take
this
buy
some
clothes
with
it
and
be
at
this
office
by
ten
he
looked
up
the
laundry
for
me
and
take
you
out
and
show
you
around
if
you
like
it
and
think
it
is
worth
the
me
know
and
it
is
yours
now
run
along
busy
see
you
look
here
mart
the
other
said
slowly
with
kindling
anger

here

to
see
you
savve
i
come
here
to
get
no
laundry
i
come
here
for
a
talk

me

you
can
do

laundry

to
he
was
out
of
the
room
when
martin
caught
him
and
whirled
him
around
look
here
joe
he
said
you
act
that
way
punch
your
head
and
for
old
sake
punch
it
hard
savve
will
will
you
joe
had
clinched
and
attempted
to
throw
him
and
he
was
twisting
and
writhing
out
of
the
advantage
of
the
hold
they
reeled
about
the
room
locked
in
each
arms
and
came
down
with
a
crash
across
the
splintered
wreckage
of
a
wicker
chair
joe
was
underneath
with
arms
spread
out
and
held
and
with
knee
on
his
chest
he
was
panting
and
gasping
for
breath
when
martin
released
him
talk
a
moment
martin
said
get
fresh
with
me
i
want
that
laundry
business
finished
first
of
all
then
you
can
come
back
and
talk
for
old
sake
i
told
you
i
was
busy

at
a
servant

just
come
in
with
the
morning
mail

great
mass
of
letters
and
magazines

i
wade
through
that
and
talk
with
you
you

and

laundry
and
then

joe
admitted
reluctantly
thought
you

but
i
guess
i
was
mistaken
but
you
lick
me
mart
in
a
fight
got
the
reach
on
put
on
the
gloves
sometime
and
see
martin
said
with
a
smile
as
soon
as
i
get
that
laundry
joe
extended
his
arm
see
that
reach
make
you
go
a
martin
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
the
door
closed
behind
the
laundryman
he
was
becoming
daily
he
found
it
a
severer
strain
to
be
decent
with
people
their
presence
perturbed
him
and
the
effort
of
conversation
irritated
him
they
made
him
restless
and
no
sooner
was
he
in
contact
with
them
than
he
was
casting
about
for
excuses
to
get
rid
of
them
he
did
not
proceed
to
attack
his
mail
and
for
a
half
hour
he
lolled
in
his
chair
doing
nothing
while
no
more
than
vague
thoughts
occasionally
filtered
through
his
intelligence
or
rather
at
wide
intervals
themselves
constituted
the
flickering
of
his
intelligence
he
roused
himself
and
began
glancing
through
his
mail
there
were
a
dozen
requests
for
knew
them
at
sight
there
were
professional
begging
letters
and
there
were
letters
from
cranks
ranging
from
the
man
with
a
working
model
of
perpetual
motion
and
the
man
who
demonstrated
that
the
surface
of
the
earth
was
the
inside
of
a
hollow
sphere
to
the
man
seeking
financial
aid
to
purchase
the
peninsula
of
lower
california
for
the
purpose
of
communist
colonization
there
were
letters
from
women
seeking
to
know
him
and
over
one
such
he
smiled
for
enclosed
was
her
receipt
for
sent
as
evidence
of
her
good
faith
and
as
proof
of
her
respectability
editors
and
publishers
contributed
to
the
daily
heap
of
letters
the
former
on
their
knees
for
his
manuscripts
the
latter
on
their
knees
for
his
poor
disdained
manuscripts
that
had
kept
all
he
possessed
in
pawn
for
so
many
dreary
months
in
order
to
fund
them
in
postage
there
were
unexpected
checks
for
english
serial
rights
and
for
advance
payments
on
foreign
translations
his
english
agent
announced
the
sale
of
german
translation
rights
in
three
of
his
books
and
informed
him
that
swedish
editions
from
which
he
could
expect
nothing
because
sweden
was
not
a
party
to
the
berne
convention
were
already
on
the
market
then
there
was
a
nominal
request
for
his
permission
for
a
russian
translation
that
country
being
likewise
outside
the
berne
convention
he
turned
to
the
huge
bundle
of
clippings
which
had
come
in
from
his
press
bureau
and
read
about
himself
and
his
vogue
which
had
become
a
furore
all
his
creative
output
had
been
flung
to
the
public
in
one
magnificent
sweep
that
seemed
to
account
for
it
he
had
taken
the
public
off
its
feet
the
way
kipling
had
that
time
when
he
lay
near
to
death
and
all
the
mob
animated
by
a
thought
began
suddenly
to
read
him
martin
remembered
how
that
same
having
read
him
and
acclaimed
him
and
not
understood
him
in
the
least
had
abruptly
a
few
months
later
flung
itself
upon
him
and
torn
him
to
pieces
martin
grinned
at
the
thought
who
was
he
that
he
should
not
be
similarly
treated
in
a
few
more
months
well
he
would
fool
the
mob
he
would
be
away
in
the
south
seas
building
his
grass
house
trading
for
pearls
and
copra
jumping
reefs
in
frail
outriggers
catching
sharks
and
bonitas
hunting
wild
goats
among
the
cliffs
of
the
valley
that
lay
next
to
the
valley
of
taiohae
in
the
moment
of
that
thought
the
desperateness
of
his
situation
dawned
upon
him
he
saw
cleared
eyed
that
he
was
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
all
the
life
that
was
in
him
was
fading
fainting
making
toward
death
he
realized
how
much
he
slept
and
how
much
he
desired
to
sleep
of
old
he
had
hated
sleep
it
had
robbed
him
of
precious
moments
of
living
four
hours
of
sleep
in
the
had
meant
being
robbed
of
four
hours
of
life
how
he
had
grudged
sleep
now
it
was
life
he
grudged
life
was
not
good
its
taste
in
his
mouth
was
without
tang
and
bitter
this
was
his
peril
life
that
did
not
yearn
toward
life
was
in
fair
way
toward
ceasing
some
remote
instinct
for
preservation
stirred
in
him
and
he
knew
he
must
get
away
he
glanced
about
the
room
and
the
thought
of
packing
was
burdensome
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
leave
that
to
the
last
in
the
meantime
he
might
be
getting
an
outfit
he
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
stopping
in
at
a
where
he
spent
the
remainder
of
the
morning
buying
automatic
rifles
ammunition
and
fishing
tackle
fashions
changed
in
trading
and
he
knew
he
would
have
to
wait
till
he
reached
tahiti
before
ordering
his
they
could
come
up
from
australia
anyway
this
solution
was
a
source
of
pleasure
he
had
avoided
doing
something
and
the
doing
of
anything
just
now
was
unpleasant
he
went
back
to
the
hotel
gladly
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
in
that
the
comfortable
morris
chair
was
waiting
for
him
and
he
groaned
inwardly
on
entering
his
room
at
sight
of
joe
in
the
morris
chair
joe
was
delighted
with
the
laundry
everything
was
settled
and
he
would
enter
into
possession
next
day
martin
lay
on
the
bed
with
closed
eyes
while
the
other
talked
on
thoughts
were
far
far
away
that
he
was
rarely
aware
that
he
was
thinking
it
was
only
by
an
effort
that
he
occasionally
responded
and
yet
this
was
joe
whom
he
had
always
liked
but
joe
was
too
keen
with
life
the
boisterous
impact
of
it
on
jaded
mind
was
a
hurt
it
was
an
aching
probe
to
his
tired
sensitiveness
when
joe
reminded
him
that
sometime
in
the
future
they
were
going
to
put
on
the
gloves
together
he
could
almost
have
screamed
joe
to
run
the
laundry
according
to
those
old
rules
you
used
to
lay
down
at
shelly
hot
springs
he
said
overworking
no
working
at
night
and
no
children
at
the
mangles
no
children
anywhere
and
a
fair
joe
nodded
and
pulled
out
a
at
here
i
was
out
them
rules
before
breakfast
this
what
think
of
them
he
read
them
aloud
and
martin
approved
worrying
at
the
same
time
as
to
when
joe
would
take
himself
off
it
was
late
afternoon
when
he
awoke
slowly
the
fact
of
life
came
back
to
him
he
glanced
about
the
room
joe
had
evidently
stolen
away
after
he
had
dozed
off
that
was
considerate
of
joe
he
thought
then
he
closed
his
eyes
and
slept
again
in
the
days
that
followed
joe
was
too
busy
organizing
and
taking
hold
of
the
laundry
to
bother
him
much
and
it
was
not
until
the
day
before
sailing
that
the
newspapers
made
the
announcement
that
he
had
taken
passage
on
the
once
when
the
instinct
of
preservation
fluttered
he
went
to
a
doctor
and
underwent
a
searching
physical
examination
nothing
could
be
found
the
matter
with
him
his
heart
and
lungs
were
pronounced
magnificent
every
organ
so
far
as
the
doctor
could
know
was
normal
and
was
working
normally
is
nothing
the
matter
with
you
eden
he
said
nothing
the
matter
with
you
you
are
in
the
pink
of
condition
candidly
i
envy
you
your
health
it
is
superb
look
at
that
chest
there
and
in
your
stomach
lies
the
secret
of
your
remarkable
constitution
physically
you
are
a
man
in
a
ten
thousand
barring
accidents
you
should
live
to
be
a
and
martin
knew
that
diagnosis
had
been
correct
physically
he
was
all
right
it
was
his
that
had
gone
wrong
and
there
was
no
cure
for
that
except
to
get
away
to
the
south
seas
the
trouble
was
that
now
on
the
verge
of
departure
he
had
no
desire
to
go
the
south
seas
charmed
him
no
more
than
did
bourgeois
civilization
there
was
no
zest
in
the
thought
of
departure
while
the
act
of
departure
appalled
him
as
a
weariness
of
the
flesh
he
would
have
felt
better
if
he
were
already
on
board
and
gone
the
last
day
was
a
sore
trial
having
read
of
his
sailing
in
the
morning
papers
bernard
higginbotham
gertrude
and
all
the
family
came
to
say
as
did
hermann
von
schmidt
and
marian
then
there
was
business
to
be
transacted
bills
to
be
paid
and
everlasting
reporters
to
be
endured
he
said
to
lizzie
connolly
abruptly
at
the
entrance
to
night
school
and
hurried
away
at
the
hotel
he
found
joe
too
busy
all
day
with
the
laundry
to
have
come
to
him
earlier
it
was
the
last
straw
but
martin
gripped
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
talked
and
listened
for
half
an
hour
know
joe
he
said
you
are
not
tied
down
to
that
laundry
there
are
no
strings
on
it
you
can
sell
it
any
time
and
blow
the
money
any
time
you
get
sick
of
it
and
want
to
hit
the
road
just
pull
out
do
what
will
make
you
the
joe
shook
his
head
more
road
in
mine
thank
you
kindly
all
right
for
one
girls
i
help
it
but
a
man
i
get
along
without
and
got
to
get
along
without
when
the
times
passed
by
houses
where
dances
parties
was
on
heard
the
women
laugh
saw
their
white
dresses
and
smiling
faces
through
the
i
tell
you
them
moments
was
plain
hell
i
like
picnics
walking
in
the
moonlight
all
the
rest
too
well
me
for
the
laundry
and
a
good
front
with
big
iron
dollars
in
my
jeans
i
seen
a
girl
already
just
yesterday
and
know
already
just
as
soon
marry
her
as
not
ben
all
day
at
the
thought
of
it
a
beaut
with
the
kindest
eyes
and
softest
voice
you
ever
heard
me
for
her
you
can
stack
on
that
say
why
you
get
married
with
all
this
money
to
burn
you
could
get
the
finest
girl
in
the
martin
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
but
in
his
secret
heart
he
was
wondering
why
any
man
wanted
to
marry
it
seemed
an
amazing
and
incomprehensible
thing
from
the
deck
of
the
at
the
sailing
hour
he
saw
lizzie
connolly
hiding
in
the
skirts
of
the
crowd
on
the
wharf
take
her
with
you
came
the
thought
it
is
easy
to
be
kind
she
will
be
supremely
happy
it
was
almost
a
temptation
one
moment
and
the
succeeding
moment
it
became
a
terror
he
was
in
a
panic
at
the
thought
of
it
his
tired
soul
cried
out
in
protest
he
turned
away
from
the
rail
with
a
groan
muttering
you
are
too
sick
you
are
too
he
fled
to
his
stateroom
where
he
lurked
until
the
steamer
was
clear
of
the
dock
in
the
dining
saloon
at
luncheon
he
found
himself
in
the
place
of
honor
at
the
right
and
he
was
not
long
in
discovering
that
he
was
the
great
man
on
board
but
no
more
unsatisfactory
great
man
ever
sailed
on
a
ship
he
spent
the
afternoon
in
a
with
closed
eyes
dozing
brokenly
most
of
the
time
and
in
the
evening
went
early
to
bed
after
the
second
day
recovered
from
seasickness
the
full
passenger
list
was
in
evidence
and
the
more
he
saw
of
the
passengers
the
more
he
disliked
them
yet
he
knew
that
he
did
them
injustice
they
were
good
and
kindly
people
he
forced
himself
to
acknowledge
and
in
the
moment
of
acknowledgment
he
and
kindly
like
all
the
bourgeoisie
with
all
the
psychological
cramp
and
intellectual
futility
of
their
kind
they
bored
him
when
they
talked
with
him
their
little
superficial
minds
were
so
filled
with
emptiness
while
the
boisterous
high
spirits
and
the
excessive
energy
of
the
younger
people
shocked
him
they
were
never
quiet
ceaselessly
playing
tossing
rings
promenading
or
rushing
to
the
rail
with
loud
cries
to
watch
the
leaping
porpoises
and
the
first
schools
of
flying
fish
he
slept
much
after
breakfast
he
sought
his
with
a
magazine
he
never
finished
the
printed
pages
tired
him
he
puzzled
that
men
found
so
much
to
write
about
and
puzzling
dozed
in
his
chair
when
the
gong
awoke
him
for
luncheon
he
was
irritated
that
he
must
awaken
there
was
no
satisfaction
in
being
awake
once
he
tried
to
arouse
himself
from
his
lethargy
and
went
forward
into
the
forecastle
with
the
sailors
but
the
breed
of
sailors
seemed
to
have
changed
since
the
days
he
had
lived
in
the
forecastle
he
could
find
no
kinship
with
these
bestial
creatures
he
was
in
despair
up
above
nobody
had
wanted
martin
eden
for
his
own
sake
and
he
could
not
go
back
to
those
of
his
own
class
who
had
wanted
him
in
the
past
he
did
not
want
them
he
could
not
stand
them
any
more
than
he
could
stand
the
stupid
passengers
and
the
riotous
young
people
life
was
to
him
like
strong
white
light
that
hurts
the
tired
eyes
of
a
sick
person
during
every
conscious
moment
life
blazed
in
a
raw
glare
around
him
and
upon
him
it
hurt
it
hurt
intolerably
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
martin
had
travelled
first
class
on
ships
at
sea
he
had
always
been
in
the
forecastle
the
steerage
or
in
the
black
depths
of
the
passing
coal
in
those
days
climbing
up
the
iron
ladders
out
the
pit
of
stifling
heat
he
had
often
caught
glimpses
of
the
passengers
in
cool
white
doing
nothing
but
enjoy
themselves
under
awnings
spread
to
keep
the
sun
and
wind
away
from
them
with
subservient
stewards
taking
care
of
their
every
want
and
whim
and
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
the
realm
in
which
they
moved
and
had
their
being
was
nothing
else
than
paradise
well
here
he
was
the
great
man
on
board
in
the
midmost
centre
of
it
sitting
at
the
right
hand
and
yet
vainly
harking
back
to
forecastle
and
in
quest
of
the
paradise
he
had
lost
he
had
found
no
new
one
and
now
he
could
not
find
the
old
one
he
strove
to
stir
himself
and
find
something
to
interest
him
he
ventured
the
petty
mess
and
was
glad
to
get
away
he
talked
with
a
quartermaster
off
duty
an
intelligent
man
who
promptly
prodded
him
with
the
socialist
propaganda
and
forced
into
his
hands
a
bunch
of
leaflets
and
pamphlets
he
listened
to
the
man
expounding
the
and
as
he
listened
he
thought
languidly
of
his
own
nietzsche
philosophy
but
what
was
it
worth
after
all
he
remembered
one
of
mad
utterances
wherein
that
madman
had
doubted
truth
and
who
was
to
say
perhaps
nietzsche
had
been
right
perhaps
there
was
no
truth
in
anything
no
truth
in
such
thing
as
truth
but
his
mind
wearied
quickly
and
he
was
content
to
go
back
to
his
chair
and
doze
miserable
as
he
was
on
the
steamer
a
new
misery
came
upon
him
what
when
the
steamer
reached
tahiti
he
would
have
to
go
ashore
he
would
have
to
order
his
to
find
a
passage
on
a
schooner
to
the
marquesas
to
do
a
thousand
and
one
things
that
were
awful
to
contemplate
whenever
he
steeled
himself
deliberately
to
think
he
could
see
the
desperate
peril
in
which
he
stood
in
all
truth
he
was
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
and
his
danger
lay
in
that
he
was
not
afraid
if
he
were
only
afraid
he
would
make
toward
life
being
unafraid
he
was
drifting
deeper
into
the
shadow
he
found
no
delight
in
the
old
familiar
things
of
life
the
was
now
in
the
northeast
trades
and
this
wine
of
wind
surging
against
him
irritated
him
he
had
his
chair
moved
to
escape
the
embrace
of
this
lusty
comrade
of
old
days
and
nights
the
day
the
entered
the
doldrums
martin
was
more
miserable
than
ever
he
could
no
longer
sleep
he
was
soaked
with
sleep
and
perforce
he
must
now
stay
awake
and
endure
the
white
glare
of
life
he
moved
about
restlessly
the
air
was
sticky
and
humid
and
the
were
unrefreshing
he
ached
with
life
he
walked
around
the
deck
until
that
hurt
too
much
then
sat
in
his
chair
until
he
was
compelled
to
walk
again
he
forced
himself
at
last
to
finish
the
magazine
and
from
the
steamer
library
he
culled
several
volumes
of
poetry
but
they
could
not
hold
him
and
once
more
he
took
to
walking
he
stayed
late
on
deck
after
dinner
but
that
did
not
help
him
for
when
he
went
below
he
could
not
sleep
this
surcease
from
life
had
failed
him
it
was
too
much
he
turned
on
the
electric
light
and
tried
to
read
one
of
the
volumes
was
a
swinburne
he
lay
in
bed
glancing
through
its
pages
until
suddenly
he
became
aware
that
he
was
reading
with
interest
he
finished
the
stanza
attempted
to
read
on
then
came
back
to
it
he
rested
the
book
face
downward
on
his
breast
and
fell
to
thinking
that
was
it
the
very
thing
strange
that
it
had
never
come
to
him
before
that
was
the
meaning
of
it
all
he
had
been
drifting
that
way
all
the
time
and
now
swinburne
showed
him
that
it
was
the
happy
way
out
he
wanted
rest
and
here
was
rest
awaiting
him
he
glanced
at
the
open
yes
it
was
large
enough
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
he
felt
happy
at
last
he
had
discovered
the
cure
of
his
ill
he
picked
up
the
book
and
read
the
stanza
slowly
aloud
too
much
love
of
living
from
hope
and
fear
set
free
we
thank
with
brief
thanksgiving
whatever
gods
may
be
that
no
life
lives
forever
that
dead
men
rise
up
never
that
even
the
weariest
river
winds
somewhere
safe
to
he
looked
again
at
the
open
port
swinburne
had
furnished
the
key
life
was
ill
or
rather
it
had
become
unbearable
thing
dead
men
rise
up
never
that
line
stirred
him
with
a
profound
feeling
of
gratitude
it
was
the
one
beneficent
thing
in
the
universe
when
life
became
an
aching
weariness
death
was
ready
to
soothe
away
to
everlasting
sleep
but
what
was
he
waiting
for
it
was
time
to
go
he
arose
and
thrust
his
head
out
the
looking
down
into
the
milky
wash
the
was
deeply
loaded
and
hanging
by
his
hands
his
feet
would
be
in
the
water
he
could
slip
in
noiselessly
no
one
would
hear
a
smother
of
spray
dashed
up
wetting
his
face
it
tasted
salt
on
his
lips
and
the
taste
was
good
he
wondered
if
he
ought
to
write
a
but
laughed
the
thought
away
there
was
no
time
he
was
too
impatient
to
be
gone
turning
off
the
light
in
his
room
so
that
it
might
not
betray
him
he
went
out
the
feet
first
his
shoulders
stuck
and
he
forced
himself
back
so
as
to
try
it
with
one
arm
down
by
his
side
a
roll
of
the
steamer
aided
him
and
he
was
through
hanging
by
his
hands
when
his
feet
touched
the
sea
he
let
go
he
was
in
a
milky
froth
of
water
the
side
of
the
rushed
past
him
like
a
dark
wall
broken
here
and
there
by
lighted
ports
she
was
certainly
making
time
almost
before
he
knew
it
he
was
astern
swimming
gently
on
the
surface
a
bonita
struck
at
his
white
body
and
he
laughed
aloud
it
had
taken
a
piece
out
and
the
sting
of
it
reminded
him
of
why
he
was
there
in
the
work
to
do
he
had
forgotten
the
purpose
of
it
the
lights
of
the
were
growing
dim
in
the
distance
and
there
he
was
swimming
confidently
as
though
it
were
his
intention
to
make
for
the
nearest
land
a
thousand
miles
or
so
away
it
was
the
automatic
instinct
to
live
he
ceased
swimming
but
the
moment
he
felt
the
water
rising
above
his
mouth
the
hands
struck
out
sharply
with
a
lifting
movement
the
will
to
live
was
his
thought
and
the
thought
was
accompanied
by
a
sneer
well
he
had
will
will
strong
enough
that
with
one
last
exertion
it
could
destroy
itself
and
cease
to
be
he
changed
his
position
to
a
vertical
one
he
glanced
up
at
the
quiet
stars
at
the
same
time
emptying
his
lungs
of
air
with
swift
vigorous
propulsion
of
hands
and
feet
he
lifted
his
shoulders
and
half
his
chest
out
of
water
this
was
to
gain
impetus
for
the
descent
then
he
let
himself
go
and
sank
without
movement
a
white
statue
into
the
sea
he
breathed
in
the
water
deeply
deliberately
after
the
manner
of
a
man
taking
an
anaesthetic
when
he
strangled
quite
involuntarily
his
arms
and
legs
clawed
the
water
and
drove
him
up
to
the
surface
and
into
the
clear
sight
of
the
stars
the
will
to
live
he
thought
disdainfully
vainly
endeavoring
not
to
breathe
the
air
into
his
bursting
lungs
well
he
would
have
to
try
a
new
way
he
filled
his
lungs
with
air
filled
them
full
this
supply
would
take
him
far
down
he
turned
over
and
went
down
head
first
swimming
with
all
his
strength
and
all
his
will
deeper
and
deeper
he
went
his
eyes
were
open
and
he
watched
the
ghostly
phosphorescent
trails
of
the
darting
bonita
as
he
swam
he
hoped
that
they
would
not
strike
at
him
for
it
might
snap
the
tension
of
his
will
but
they
did
not
strike
and
he
found
time
to
be
grateful
for
this
last
kindness
of
life
down
down
he
swam
till
his
arms
and
legs
grew
tired
and
hardly
moved
he
knew
that
he
was
deep
the
pressure
on
his
was
a
pain
and
there
was
a
buzzing
in
his
head
his
endurance
was
faltering
but
he
compelled
his
arms
and
legs
to
drive
him
deeper
until
his
will
snapped
and
the
air
drove
from
his
lungs
in
a
great
explosive
rush
the
bubbles
rubbed
and
bounded
like
tiny
balloons
against
his
cheeks
and
eyes
as
they
took
their
upward
flight
then
came
pain
and
strangulation
this
hurt
was
not
death
was
the
thought
that
oscillated
through
his
reeling
consciousness
death
did
not
hurt
it
was
life
the
pangs
of
life
this
awful
suffocating
feeling
it
was
the
last
blow
life
could
deal
him
his
wilful
hands
and
feet
began
to
beat
and
churn
about
spasmodically
and
feebly
but
he
had
fooled
them
and
the
will
to
live
that
made
them
beat
and
churn
he
was
too
deep
down
they
could
never
bring
him
to
the
surface
he
seemed
floating
languidly
in
a
sea
of
dreamy
vision
colors
and
radiances
surrounded
him
and
bathed
him
and
pervaded
him
what
was
that
it
seemed
a
lighthouse
but
it
was
inside
his
flashing
bright
white
light
it
flashed
swifter
and
swifter
there
was
a
long
rumble
of
sound
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
falling
down
a
vast
and
interminable
stairway
and
somewhere
at
the
bottom
he
fell
into
darkness
that
much
he
knew
he
had
fallen
into
darkness
and
at
the
instant
he
knew
he
ceased
to
know
