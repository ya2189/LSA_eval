introduction
the
sun
goes
down
for
those
alone
who
stand
on
a
revolving
sphere
and
so
in
nature
universal
life
death
is
but
a
dissolving
view
a
word
without
a
meaning
real
only
to
the
accidental
unit
to
whose
local
and
momentary
combination
it
sets
a
term
death
is
a
thing
of
nought
phenomenal
kaleidoscopic
a
juggle
of
the
mother
of
illusion
prakriti
or
máyá
whose
magic
scene
not
only
never
dies
but
like
her
own
wild
animals
sleeps
even
with
an
open
eye
you
never
catch
her
napping
and
often
when
you
think
that
you
have
done
it
she
winks
at
you
just
as
it
were
to
show
you
your
mistake
as
sometimes
on
a
hot
midsummer
day
when
the
delicate
blue
smoke
from
cottage
chimneys
rises
straight
into
the
air
and
nature
holds
her
breath
you
think
she
is
asleep
and
all
at
once
there
comes
a
little
whisper
and
a
ripple
passes
over
all
the
golden
ears
of
corn
and
in
another
moment
all
is
still
or
on
a
cliff
that
overhangs
a
glassy
sea
you
lie
and
dream
and
think
the
very
water
sleeps
and
then
a
sudden
change
of
colour
flushes
the
ocean
opal
for
only
a
single
instant
and
is
gone
or
in
a
wood
at
noon
you
listen
to
the
silence
and
a
rustle
suddenly
quivers
in
the
trees
and
dies
away
murmurs
and
echoes
moments
and
emotions
of
the
pulses
of
the
world
hints
and
indications
still
small
voices
more
significant
than
storms
of
the
thrill
and
throb
of
universal
action
tremor
gravitation
excites
in
any
planet
is
immediately
transmitted
to
the
farthest
limits
of
the
system
in
oscillations
corresponding
in
their
periods
with
the
causes
that
produce
them
like
sympathetic
notes
in
music
or
vibrations
from
the
deep
tones
of
an
organ
the
human
frame
may
be
regarded
as
an
elastic
system
the
different
parts
of
which
are
capable
of
receiving
the
tremors
of
elastic
media
and
of
vibrating
in
unison
with
their
innumerable
so
far
sober
modern
science
never
dreaming
that
it
is
exactly
reproducing
translate
the
thing
only
from
physics
into
ethics
the
old
hindoo
idea
that
moral
conservation
of
energy
whose
fundamental
axiom
it
is
that
no
action
good
or
bad
however
small
is
or
ever
can
be
lost
but
like
a
stone
thrown
into
the
water
generates
innumerable
consequences
running
in
all
directions
to
infinity
producing
permanent
impressions
and
effects
that
follow
and
fatally
determine
eternal
and
indelible
the
fortunes
of
their
doer
through
the
series
of
interminable
births
and
deaths
births
that
are
no
beginning
and
deaths
that
are
not
an
end
thus
do
we
go
on
making
for
ourselves
our
weal
or
woe
and
as
we
go
hounds
of
deeds
long
buried
in
oblivion
are
on
our
doubtless
a
little
story
might
have
a
more
delicious
name
than
the
one
before
us
but
doubtless
it
never
had
we
may
understand
it
either
of
a
young
woman
or
the
moon
and
in
either
case
it
means
more
things
than
one
i
new
moon
seen
for
a
single
instant
in
the
sky
or
on
the
lotus
or
on
the
forehead
of
ii
beauty
with
eyes
like
a
great
blue
lotus
or
the
colour
of
for
all
these
things
have
a
quality
in
common
the
mystic
blue
strange
how
deep
an
impression
the
colour
seems
to
have
made
upon
the
indian
mind
gods
and
peacocks
creepers
and
lotuses
clouds
and
pools
and
skies
and
seas
elephants
and
maidens
glances
are
all
mixed
up
together
in
their
language
by
their
participation
in
this
platonic
idea
this
transcendental
blue
something
of
this
indeed
is
readily
intelligible
in
every
land
but
in
india
it
is
more
so
the
blue
is
bluer
there
the
poet
understand
travel
in
the
poet
i
will
not
say
with
goethe
kenst
thou
that
land
but
simply
tell
the
reader
something
that
i
saw
at
mahabaleshwar
in
the
month
of
may
and
with
it
the
hot
weather
was
drawing
to
a
close
the
woods
were
green
but
very
very
dry
and
all
their
ferny
fringes
by
the
red
were
parched
and
powdered
thick
with
ruddy
dust
each
morning
when
i
stood
in
my
verandah
looking
down
the
valley
i
could
see
a
floor
of
cloud
now
rolled
out
like
a
now
tossing
like
a
troubled
sea
now
floating
wreath
on
wreath
like
a
ballet
dancer
gauzy
flounces
half
opaque
and
half
transparent
over
the
distant
konkan
three
thousand
feet
and
more
below
waiting
for
the
rising
sun
to
touch
it
with
a
rosy
blush
and
kiss
it
into
invisibility
and
every
evening
just
as
he
went
away
the
hot
haze
hanging
like
a
filmy
veil
about
the
hills
thickened
back
into
solidity
and
beautiful
cold
mists
reborn
rolled
swiftly
up
the
valley
blotting
out
the
picture
and
hiding
all
with
their
ghostly
shifting
curtain
and
so
from
morn
to
night
and
night
to
morning
it
went
on
till
lines
of
bullock
carts
began
to
gather
and
wander
down
the
hill
and
people
were
preparing
to
pack
and
flit
and
vanish
for
the
monsoon
was
approaching
when
no
one
not
a
native
of
those
parts
can
remain
upon
the
hill
unless
he
wishes
to
go
mad
and
then
it
began
to
rain
suddenly
like
the
day
of
judgment
there
fell
from
the
sky
in
a
solid
lump
rain
like
no
rain
that
i
had
ever
seen
before
with
the
roar
of
an
avalanche
and
the
thunder
of
indra
and
lightning
that
hissed
like
a
serpent
crashing
and
smashing
down
on
the
roof
as
if
it
would
break
it
in
it
was
dark
at
midday
and
deadly
cold
for
there
went
up
a
mist
from
the
earth
to
meet
the
flood
from
heaven
making
as
it
were
a
solid
wall
through
which
it
was
impossible
to
see
a
yard
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
sit
and
wait
so
for
five
nights
and
days
that
angry
rain
raged
and
hammered
upon
the
earth
and
tore
her
with
savage
fury
growing
fiercer
as
it
went
on
till
all
at
once
just
as
though
the
gates
above
had
been
suddenly
shut
it
stopped
as
abruptly
as
it
had
begun
about
five
in
the
afternoon
i
went
out
and
wandered
slowly
up
the
hill
the
air
was
soft
and
quite
warm
and
heavy
with
the
smell
of
smells
the
fragrance
of
fresh
earth
here
and
there
the
paths
were
gone
washed
clean
away
looking
like
red
skeletons
of
their
former
selves
with
rock
for
bones
all
their
earthy
covering
gone
and
here
and
there
a
little
off
the
road
a
pale
orchid
sheltered
beneath
a
bough
or
a
dainty
nestling
snug
under
an
overhanging
trunk
peeped
with
incomparable
shy
reserve
through
some
dark
vista
in
the
trees
a
mongoose
ran
across
the
road
stopped
just
to
stare
for
an
instant
at
me
with
its
startled
weasel
eye
and
leaped
into
cover
on
the
opposite
side
in
a
few
minutes
i
gained
a
point
of
view
and
turned
to
look
over
a
sea
of
green
and
what
a
green
for
every
leaf
on
every
tree
was
washed
and
wet
and
glistened
as
if
coated
with
fresh
paint
the
rich
glow
of
a
yellow
evening
sun
deepened
and
intensified
the
wonderful
red
colour
of
patches
of
naked
rock
raw
scars
laid
bare
by
little
slips
of
land
on
places
on
the
hill
cascades
of
water
shot
spouting
and
splashing
into
the
valleys
from
innumerable
scarps
and
shelves
along
the
heights
and
as
i
listened
i
could
hear
the
streams
hidden
in
the
dense
foliage
rushing
and
gurgling
down
the
steep
slopes
carrying
with
them
as
they
went
all
the
loose
soil
and
pebbles
they
could
find
and
all
along
the
ridges
of
the
hills
to
right
and
left
on
elphinstone
and
lodwick
points
hung
brooding
enormous
masses
of
white
cloud
the
purest
the
strangest
the
most
indescribably
magnificent
and
beautiful
clouds
that
i
ever
saw
whiter
than
snow
brighter
than
polished
silver
save
only
where
their
lower
edges
were
charged
with
heavy
rain
fleeces
of
colossal
rams
dipped
by
the
master
painter
deity
in
giant
vats
of
purple
ink
down
and
away
below
them
the
staircase
of
the
ghauts
long
lines
of
broken
hill
were
stepping
away
into
the
plain
with
every
distant
detail
sharp
and
clear
cut
as
it
were
in
copper
till
all
merged
in
the
far
horizon
on
which
a
of
burnished
gold
flashed
back
from
the
unseen
sea
lying
right
in
the
eye
of
the
setting
sun
i
listened
and
in
the
silence
broken
only
by
the
ruckle
of
the
rushing
water
somewhere
away
upon
the
hill
i
heard
a
cock
crow
and
at
that
moment
right
above
me
i
looked
and
saw
a
mass
of
shining
cloud
swung
slowly
open
and
through
the
gap
in
the
deep
abyss
of
heaven
appeared
a
spot
a
panel
a
little
lozenge
of
blue
pure
unsullied
silent
elemental
indian
blue
there
there
was
the
unearthly
colour
the
colour
of
the
mystic
lotus
and
the
languishing
indian
gods
i
knew
in
that
instant
what
kalidas
meant
when
he
compared
the
virtue
of
the
just
to
a
patch
of
heaven
fallen
down
to
earth
the
blue
celestial
leaven
in
this
world
of
frenzied
storm
and
weeping
rain
there
was
the
azure
paradox
the
blue
that
is
all
but
black
dark
transparent
clear
as
crystal
shut
out
from
eyes
that
live
in
plains
by
earth
encircling
fog
but
every
mountain
is
and
the
kosmic
blue
mahabaleshwar
in
but
a
part
of
the
last
night
there
fell
eight
inches
and
a
half
of
rain
time
for
time
mahabaleshwar
can
probably
laugh
at
cherrapunji
the
valleys
are
scooped
out
as
if
with
a
trowel
this
mongoose
was
no
doubt
wondering
what
the
devil
i
did

and

a

lotus
i
the
pitchy
dark
of
that
awful
wood
where
plunging
ganges
lost
her
way
through
a
night
of
a
thousand
years
when
the
lonely
moon
turned
ashy
pale
mocked
by
a
million
moons
that
danced
in
the
hollows
of
the
rushing
waves
we
on
the
edge
of
the
great
southern
forest
there
lived
a
thousand
years
ago
an
aged
king
and
queen
who
counted
all
the
world
as
grass
for
want
of
a
son
and
heir
and
finding
all
other
methods
fruitless
in
the
end
they
gave
themselves
wholly
up
to
meditating
night
and
day
on
the
sole
of
the
great
god
foot
until
at
last
maheshwara
felt
pity
for
that
childless
couple
and
revealed
himself
to
them
both
at
once
in
a
double
dream
so
when
he
asked
them
what
they
wanted
the
king
asked
simply
for
a
son
but
the
queen
being
smitten
with
deep
devotion
at
the
sight
of
the
great
god
moonlit
hair
exclaimed
o
boon
giver
let
my
son
resemble
thee
were
it
only
in
a
single
fraction
of
an
atom
of
his
being
touch
me
now
with
the
very
end
of
one
of
thy
tangled
locks
of
hair
and
so
shall
i
become
instinct
with
a
tiny
portion
of
thy
divinity
then
said
shiwa
to
himself
even
a
single
jot
of
me
will
be
much
too
powerful
for
the
rest
of
this
human
substance
and
disturb
the
balance
of
the
whole
but
be
it
as
this
mother
wills
for
she
has
made
her
choice
and
i
granted
the
boon
beforehand
and
i
can
see
that
he
has
to
dree
the
weird
of
his
former
births
then
he
took
from
his
head
a
single
hair
and
broke
it
off
and
placed
it
in
her
hand
and
then
he
disappeared
and
that
royal
pair
awoke
and
eagerly
compared
their
dreams
which
corresponded
in
every
particular
and
when
they
looked
lo
shut
fast
in
the
hand
of
the
queen
was
a
single
hair
that
glowed
like
a
wire
of
flame
then
full
of
joy
they
worshipped
the
god
and
they
placed
that
hair
in
a
golden
shrine
and
built
around
it
a
temple
and
when
in
course
of
time
the
queen
gave
birth
to
a
son
they
called
him
by
a
suitable
name
rudrálaka
and
as
the
baby
became
a
child
he
did
not
belie
his
name
for
his
thick
dark
hair
was
shot
with
a
tinge
of
gleaming
red
and
in
the
sun
it
shone
like
fire
and
it
resembled
the
mane
of
a
horse
and
as
the
boy
became
a
man
his
strength
became
prodigious
and
his
passions
were
wild
and
furious
and
proportioned
to
his
strength
and
he
was
as
unruly
and
unmanageable
as
a
young
colt
of
high
spirit
and
so
full
of
wayward
obstinacy
and
headstrong
that
his
father
said
in
private
to
his
mother
now
but
that
the
hair
in
thy
hand
was
red
this
son
of
thine
would
seem
to
take
after
not
the
great
god
himself
but
his
bull
and
when
his
manhood
was
complete
like
a
river
in
flood
in
the
rainy
season
it
overflowed
all
common
bounds
and
he
ran
wild
among
men
and
women
overcoming
all
the
men
in
every
feat
of
strength
and
agility
and
like
a
great
black
bee
in
a
flower
garden
rifling
all
the
women
of
their
honey
and
their
hearts
and
their
good
behaviour
and
playing
havoc
among
them
till
the
mischief
created
by
his
own
red
hair
began
as
it
were
to
turn
that
of
his
father
and
mother
white
then
they
said
come
we
will
marry
him
and
then
no
doubt
he
will
settle
down
and
become
clear
like
strong
wine
after
fermentation
and
turn
into
a
pillar
of
his
family
and
the
state
but
as
soon
as
they
proposed
it
rudrálaka
laughed
in
their
faces
and
he
exclaimed
who
carries
a
flower
when
it
is
faded
and
what
are
women
but
flowers
fit
only
to
be
gathered
in
the
moment
of
their
bloom
and
worn
for
an
hour
and
thrown
away
and
he
is
wise
who
knows
how
to
get
from
the
bee
its
honey
and
yet
elude
its
sting
now
a
maiden
is
all
honey
but
a
wife
is
a
buzzing
sting
moreover
women
are
like
mountains
and
like
snakes
and
fire
and
the
mirage
beautiful
in
the
distance
and
the
further
off
the
better
and
like
them
rugged
and
biting
and
burning
and
luring
to
destruction
all
who
come
too
near
but
of
all
things
this
is
worst
that
every
woman
wishes
like
a
king
to
reign
alone
and
is
utterly
unable
to
endure
the
very
name
of
rival
even
in
her
dreams
so
that
every
husband
has
in
his
wife
either
a
despotic
tyrant
or
an
exasperated
foe
whom
nothing
can
appease
or
soothe
but
absolute
submission
and
thus
his
life
is
sapped
and
sucked
and
drawn
into
the
being
of
his
wife
till
it
wholly
disappears
like
that
of
a
noble
tree
embraced
and
treacherously
kissed
into
a
premature
decay
by
a
beautiful
and
clinging
creeper
and
no
matter
how
glorious
the
flower
i
will
not
be
the
tree
nor
would
i
buy
a
wife
were
she
ten
thousand
times
more
beautiful
than
rádhá
by
the
slavery
even
of
a
single
day
and
what
is
the
need
to
pay
so
dear
for
things
that
are
always
ready
to
give
themselves
away
for
nothing
and
would
rather
give
themselves
away
than
be
bought
at
any
price
for
women
are
always
longing
to
give
themselves
away
and
care
only
for
men
that
they
do
not
know
being
forgetful
of
all
kindness
and
unbound
by
obligation
and
seeing
in
their
husband
nothing
but
his
faults
while
every
passing
stranger
has
their
heart
as
soon
as
he
appears
just
as
long
as
he
is
strange
for
love
is
himself
a
stranger
and
can
not
become
familiar
without
ceasing
to
be
love
and
women
live
for
love
alone
being
like
flowers
nothing
but
his
instruments
and
he
is
like
the
amber
and
they
are
like
the
grass
so
when
they
found
that
in
spite
of
all
that
they
could
say
he
would
not
be
persuaded
but
that
the
more
they
tried
the
harder
grew
his
obstinacy
his
parents
gave
it
up
and
soon
afterwards
their
hearts
broke
with
grief
and
they
died
leaving
him
unmarried
and
fearing
for
him
and
the
kingdom
and
their
ancestors
and
themselves
lest
all
should
go
to
ruin
by
reason
of
the
incorrigible
perversity
of
this
cutter
of
their
race
stalk
and
then
just
as
though
he
had
only
waited
for
their
death
no
sooner
had
his
two
parents
gone
away
on
the
great
road
than
this
son
of
theirs
went
hunting
in
the
forest
and
he
rode
a
horse
of
spirit
like
his
own
which
after
a
while
broke
from
control
and
fled
at
full
speed
carrying
him
in
an
instant
out
of
sight
of
all
his
attendants
and
it
brought
him
deep
in
the
heart
of
the
wood
to
his
destiny
in
the
form
of
a
woman
the
daughter
of
an
old
ascetic
whose
beauty
like
a
deadly
snake
bit
and
slew
in
a
single
moment
his
antipathy
to
the
state
of
marriage
by
the
poison
of
its
childlike
charm
and
utterly
beside
himself
he
wooed
her
then
and
there
and
brought
her
home
on
his
own
horse
and
made
her
his
wife
and
queen
and
she
changed
him
so
completely
that
he
to
whom
a
wife
was
slavery
became
a
woman
willing
slave
so
much
so
that
he
could
not
bear
to
let
her
out
of
his
sight
even
for
a
single
instant
and
he
became
like
an
image
of
arddhanári
inseparable
from
his
wife
holding
her
in
his
arms
night
and
day
and
chafing
like
a
wild
animal
kept
without
food
in
a
cage
if
she
left
him
only
to
drink
water
and
the
god
of
the
flowery
bow
laughed
to
see
his
infatuation
and
he
said
softly
to
himself
a
converted
scoffer
is
after
all
the
best
adorer
for
even
a
very
clever
swan
would
fail
to
separate
this
but
the
king
subjects
were
overjoyed
and
they
said
now
then
his
parents
will
be
happy
and
if
his
passion
is
so
violent
that
at
present
he
utterly
neglects
his
kingly
duties
no
matter
for
when
it
has
become
cool
he
will
be
the
very
of
his
race
and
then
while
he
was
entirely
bewitched
and
enthralled
by
his
passion
for
his
new
young
moon
of
a
bride
some
neighbouring
kings
his
hereditary
enemies
hearing
of
his
condition
and
seizing
their
opportunity
combined
together
and
attacked
him
and
after
a
while
his
subjects
on
the
frontier
being
ruined
paid
no
taxes
so
driven
by
necessity
he
said
to
his
wife
with
a
sigh
there
is
no
help
for
it
and
now
i
must
absolutely
leave
thee
for
a
little
while
to
pull
these
thorns
up
by
the
roots
for
if
not
the
kingdom
will
be
destroyed
yet
only
for
a
very
little
while
for
i
will
return
almost
before
i
have
started
and
collecting
his
army
he
put
himself
at
its
head
and
threw
himself
upon
those
kings
and
scattered
them
like
leaves
in
a
storm
of
wind
and
reduced
them
to
beg
for
mercy
for
he
was
beside
himself
with
rage
seeing
in
them
not
so
much
enemies
of
his
kingdom
as
causes
of
his
unwilling
separation
from
his
wife
and
having
speedily
gained
his
object
he
sent
relays
of
horses
and
posted
them
at
intervals
all
the
way
from
his
camp
to
his
capital
and
then
at
last
one
morning
he
mounted
a
horse
and
started
with
but
one
attendant
and
a
heart
on
fire
to
return
to
his
wife
so
they
rode
all
day
long
at
full
speed
stopping
only
as
long
as
was
necessary
to
let
them
leap
from
one
horse
to
another
as
if
wishing
to
rival
the
sun
in
his
course
till
that
unhappy
companion
of
the
king
was
almost
dead
from
fatigue
for
he
was
not
supported
like
his
master
by
the
burning
desire
to
arrive
but
the
king
rode
on
as
it
were
in
a
dream
seeing
nothing
before
him
but
the
edge
of
the
far
horizon
and
the
image
of
his
wife
beyond
and
so
the
day
went
by
and
as
the
sun
was
going
down
they
drew
near
to
the
capital
and
saw
its
walls
before
them
away
on
the
distant
plain
and
the
king
uttered
a
shout
and
he
drove
his
spurs
deep
into
the
flanks
of
his
flying
horse
and
left
his
follower
far
behind
and
he
rode
into
the
city
like
a
whirlwind
and
dashed
through
its
streets
scattering
the
people
and
spurning
them
as
it
were
from
his
horse
hoofs
and
he
reached
his
palace
and
rode
through
the
gates
into
the
court
and
threw
himself
to
the
ground
and
he
stood
on
the
palace
steps
and
called
aloud
with
a
joyous
voice
ho
go
quickly
and
tell
the
queen
that
the
king
has
come
and
waits
only
for
her
permission
to
kneel
at
her
then
the
guards
who
stood
around
gazed
at
the
king
and
at
each
other
in
silence
and
dismay
and
as
they
waited
there
came
to
the
king
an
old
chamberlain
who
stood
before
him
with
joined
hands
and
stooping
and
his
face
was
grey
with
fear
and
he
said
with
a
shaking
voice
let
the
king
show
mercy
has
he
not
met
the
couriers
the
queen
died
of
a
burning
fever
only
three
days
ago
and
the
king
fell
to
the
earth
as
though
one
had
struck
him
on
the
head
with
an
iron
club

hair

caught

it

must
ask
the
reader
to
excuse
me
for
using
a

there

it

the

should

that
the

that

has
in

strain

wildness
something
on
the
of

abode
of

the

is
credited
by

with
the
power
of
separating
the
two
a
curious
idea
of
which
it
is
not
easy
to
see
the
origin
ii
and
they
took
him
up
and
carried
him
in
and
laid
him
on
a
bed
and
there
he
remained
like
a
dead
man
and
for
so
long
that
they
begun
to
doubt
whether
he
were
not
dead
indeed
but
at
last
the
physicians
by
their
remedies
brought
him
back
to
the
body
but
his
reason
had
fled
for
he
raved
and
fought
struggling
with
the
strength
of
a
giant
and
biting
like
a
wild
beast
tearing
his
own
hair
and
shouting
for
his
wife
and
he
threw
himself
upon
his
attendants
and
handled
them
so
that
they
feared
for
their
lives
and
he
ran
through
the
palace
hunting
for
his
wife
and
calling
her
by
name
and
when
he
could
not
find
her
he
fell
on
all
whom
he
met
and
beat
them
and
came
so
near
to
killing
many
that
at
last
his
ministers
took
counsel
and
caused
him
to
be
bound
so
after
raging
for
many
days
taking
neither
food
nor
drink
he
fell
into
a
burning
fever
as
if
he
wished
to
follow
his
wife
by
the
very
road
she
went
herself
and
he
lay
for
many
weeks
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
door
of
death
but
his
strength
was
such
that
he
could
not
die
and
so
after
a
long
while
he
came
back
very
slowly
and
as
it
were
against
his
will
to
life
and
to
himself
and
little
by
little
recovered
health
and
took
once
more
to
his
kingly
duties
and
the
bearing
of
the
burden
of
the
state
but
it
was
as
if
his
better
part
had
died
refusing
to
be
parted
from
his
wife
in
the
other
world
and
leaving
behind
in
this
only
so
much
of
his
soul
as
was
necessary
to
enable
him
to
live
at
all
for
he
never
moved
from
his
palace
roaming
about
its
rooms
always
silent
and
always
alone
with
his
head
sunk
down
upon
his
breast
and
his
sad
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
and
over
his
dark
face
there
never
passed
the
whiteness
of
a
smile
for
his
dead
wife
shadow
lay
across
it
and
her
figure
moved
before
him
night
and
day
and
her
sweetness
not
to
be
forgotten
and
never
to
return
rankled
in
his
heart
like
a
thorn
and
goaded
it
and
gnawed
it
and
festered
in
his
soul
and
sleep
forsook
his
eyes
which
were
wild
and
haggard
and
such
that
all
who
saw
them
feared
him
and
were
wary
in
his
presence
for
every
now
and
then
he
broke
out
into
paroxysms
of
grief
mixed
with
laughter
during
which
he
seemed
as
it
were
not
to
know
what
he
was
doing
and
was
as
dangerous
to
approach
as
a
wild
mother
elephant
robbed
by
hunters
of
her
calf
and
so
he
lived
and
months
went
by
and
the
grey
hairs
came
before
their
time
and
settled
in
his
head
and
sowed
as
it
were
its
fire
with
the
ashes
of
grey
grief
and
age
saw
her
opportunity
and
began
unheeded
and
unhindered
to
furrow
wrinkles
in
his
brow
and
dig
deep
corners
at
the
ends
of
his
stern
shut
lips
iii
now
it
happened
on
a
day
when
the
great
god
was
roaming
through
the
sky
with
umá
in
his
arms
that
they
passed
close
by
the
moon
and
suddenly
they
heard
in
the
stillness
a
mournful
voice
like
the
note
of
a
bewailing
her
lost
mate
exclaiming
at
intervals
alas
alas
so
they
stopped
and
alighted
on
the
surface
of
the
orb
and
wandered
about
in
his
camphored
air
guided
by
the
sound
till
they
came
all
at
once
upon
a
siddhá
and
she
was
sitting
under
a
sandal
tree
leaning
her
head
against
the
trunk
with
large
tears
in
her
great
blue
eyes
and
a
cloud
of
dark
dishevelled
hair
floating
about
her
bare
white
bosom
whose
two
colossal
pearls
rose
and
fell
heaving
and
fretting
as
if
regretting
their
absent
ocean
home
then
filled
with
compassion
and
curiosity
umá
exclaimed
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
sighing
siddhá
and
maheshwara
divined
the
truth
but
he
said
ask
her
thereupon
párwatí
said
o
thou
lotus
lady
what
is
thy
trouble
and
the
siddhá
said
o
daughter
of
the
mountain
i
have
attained
by
superfluity
of
merit
to
this
position
of
a
siddhá
which
notwithstanding
is
only
a
grief
and
no
pleasure
to
me
for
i
remember
my
former
birth
and
i
can
see
my
husband
sorrowing
for
my
absence
away
below
and
now
i
would
give
all
that
remains
of
my
unexhausted
stock
of
accumulated
merit
for
a
single
moment
of
the
time
that
is
past
did
it
last
no
longer
than
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
for
what
is
the
use
of
my
siddháhood
or
anything
else
without
my
lord
or
why
am
i
cursed
with
reminiscence
and
not
rather
rewarded
with
oblivion
for
memory
binds
my
soul
and
links
it
like
a
red
hot
chain
to
the
burning
fire
of
a
dead
delight
then
párwatí
said
in
private
to
the
god
canst
thou
not
do
something
for
this
lovely
siddhá
and
maheshwara
replied
this
is
the
nature
of
women
that
for
the
sake
of
their
single
lover
they
would
annihilate
the
three
worlds
but
what
has
pity
to
do
with
the
constitution
of
the
universe
or
how
can
time
return
again
and
all
be
thrown
into
confusion
simply
to
allow
two
foolish
lovers
to
meet
once
more
so
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
be
done
but
párwatí
coaxed
him
and
cajoled
him
knowing
the
power
of
her
two
white
arms
until
at
last
he
said
since
i
can
refuse
thee
nothing
and
thou
art
absolutely
set
upon
it
i
will
to
please
thee
cause
these
two
unhappy
persons
to
their
little
drama
and
taste
again
the
nectar
of
that
love
which
they
so
much
regret
but
only
in
a
dream
for
dreams
were
established
by
the
creator
for
this
very
reason
that
a
remedy
might
be
found
for
the
irrevocable
nature
of
reality
for
that
must
be
as
it
has
been
and
can
not
be
recalled
or
changed
but
anything
may
happen
in
a
dream
and
yet
this
pair
of
lovers
would
be
wiser
were
they
content
to
let
alone
and
leave
things
as
they
are
for
they
will
but
make
their
misery
more
by
the
very
means
they
wish
to
take
to
lessen
and
remove
it
but
be
that
as
it
may
and
then
he
cast
upon
the
siddhá
a
kindly
glance
and
he
said
silly
child
that
wouldst
be
wiser
than
those
who
framed
the
three
great
worlds
be
now
consoled
thou
shalt
at
least
have
thy
way
for
a
little
while
and
meet
the
lord
of
thy
heart
again
halfway
between
heaven
and
earth
and
hearing
this
the
siddhá
fell
before
him
and
took
his
foot
and
kissed
it
and
placed
it
in
her
bosom
and
she
said
o
saviour
of
the
shipwrecked
that
are
sinking
in
the
waves
of
time
o
send
me
thy
succour
soon
for
i
am
like
one
dying
of
thirst
in
the
desert
for
the
blue
water
of
my
husband
arms
the
moon
according
to
some
philosophers
is
the
home
of
those
who
have
purged
themselves
in
former
births
sufficiently
to
deserve
a
certain
grade
of
beatitude
or
bliss
iv
and
at
that
very
moment
the
king
her
husband
on
the
earth
was
sitting
in
his
palace
hall
musing
on
her
memory
and
dreaming
of
the
past
and
listening
to
the
musicians
playing
before
him
as
he
sat
so
as
they
played
as
luck
would
have
it
they
fell
upon
an
air
which
ran
into
his
heart
and
pierced
it
like
a
poisoned
needle
for
it
was
the
favourite
air
of
his
vanished
queen
and
as
he
listened
the
tears
came
rushing
into
his
eyes
blinding
them
with
and
the
blackness
of
despair
and
he
started
up
and
called
aloud
in
a
voice
of
thunder
away
begone
wretches
have
ye
conspired
together
to
break
my
heart
in
two
and
instantly
those
unlucky
players
stopped
affrighted
and
fled
before
his
wrath
like
hares
and
as
all
shrank
before
him
the
domestic
chaplain
came
forward
and
said
politely
o
king
without
are
waiting
certain
merchants
jewellers
who
have
come
here
by
appointment
to
lay
their
jewels
at
thy
feet
then
the
king
said
with
a
sigh
what
are
all
their
gems
to
me
and
yet
no
matter
let
them
all
come
in
so
in
came
all
the
merchants
and
showed
the
king
each
what
he
had
and
the
king
went
up
and
down
saying
sadly
to
himself
now
every
pleasure
is
a
pain
and
every
joy
a
grief
for
what
are
jewels
to
me
now
that
she
is
no
more
on
whom
i
would
have
hung
them
till
she
sank
beneath
their
weight
and
then
as
if
in
irony
he
took
the
jewels
and
began
to
put
them
on
himself
and
taking
from
the
merchants
all
they
had
he
hung
himself
all
over
loading
himself
with
gorgeous
gems
with
emeralds
and
rubies
and
pearls
and
amethysts
and
diamonds
and
sapphires
and
every
other
stone
till
he
flashed
as
it
were
with
a
thousand
hues
and
resembled
an
incarnation
of
the
spoiling
of
the
sea
so
as
he
went
from
one
merchant
to
another
adding
to
his
store
he
came
suddenly
on
an
old
merchant
who
stood
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
with
nothing
visible
to
sell
and
his
head
was
of
enormous
size
and
bare
and
bald
on
the
top
and
from
its
sides
long
thick
white
hair
ran
down
over
his
shoulders
and
mingled
with
his
beard
and
his
face
was
wrinkled
all
over
like
the
skin
of
a
withered
fruit
and
the
king
stopped
and
considered
him
amazed
at
the
extraordinary
size
of
his
head
which
resembled
a
monstrous
gourd
and
then
he
said
ha
merchant
thou
art
idle
where
are
thy
valuables
and
what
is
thy
commodity
doubtless
that
must
be
a
treasure
which
thou
keepest
wrapped
away
so
carefully
from
common
eyes
but
come
produce
it
that
i
may
add
it
to
all
these
then
said
the
merchant
all
these
are
well
enough
and
yet
the
thing
that
i
have
brought
the
king
is
more
than
all
together
and
yet
again
less
than
the
least
then
the
king
said
of
what
then
art
thou
a
seller
and
the
merchant
said
o
king
i
am
a
seller
of
dreams
and
the
king
looked
at
him
awhile
and
was
seized
with
sudden
laughter
and
he
exclaimed
what
is
this
and
who
ever
heard
of
a
seller
of
dreams
art
thou
mad
or
art
thou
only
an
old
buffoon
then
that
old
merchant
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
king
and
he
said
o
king
who
can
tell
whether
he
is
mad
or
not
but
as
for
me
know
that
mine
are
no
common
dreams
but
they
are
such
as
many
would
give
all
they
had
and
more
than
all
they
had
to
dream
for
i
can
make
the
past
present
and
i
can
find
that
which
is
lost
and
join
together
whom
time
has
parted
and
turn
regret
to
laughing
joy
and
i
can
mend
the
and
bring
love
fierce
emotion
back
and
into
faded
flowers
of
passion
i
can
breathe
again
their
old
sweet
bloom
and
make
to
echo
in
living
ears
the
music
of
lips
that
have
long
been
dead
and
as
he
spoke
the
king
stood
and
his
heart
rose
up
into
his
mouth
for
the
words
of
the
old
merchant
played
on
it
as
if
it
were
a
lute
and
tugged
at
it
like
a
cord
and
the
memory
of
his
wife
surged
suddenly
in
his
soul
and
swept
it
like
a
wind
and
all
at
once
he
seized
that
old
man
by
the
throat
with
hands
that
trembled
with
the
ecstasy
of
rage
and
shook
him
like
a
leaf
and
his
voice
faltered
with
passion
as
he
said
old
fool
dost
thou
mock
me
dost
thou
promise
without
performing
beware
for
thou
art
playing
with
a
fire
that
will
shrivel
thee
like
a
blade
of
grass
then
said
the
old
merchant
with
laughter
in
his
wrinkled
eyes
o
king
thou
art
a
child
not
recognising
thy
physician
and
seeking
a
quarrel
with
the
only
one
who
can
give
thee
a
medicine
suited
to
thy
case
for
i
am
a
physician
not
of
the
body
but
of
the
soul
so
now
tell
me
wilt
thou
buy
from
me
a
dream
or
not
and
the
king
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
and
he
said
sell
me
indeed
a
dream
such
as
i
wish
and
thou
hast
described
and
i
tell
thee
this
that
i
will
not
haggle
with
thee
over
the
price
then
the
old
man
laughed
softly
and
he
said
maháráj
who
ever
speaks
of
the
price
before
he
has
seen
and
tried
the
goods
first
thou
shalt
have
thy
dream
and
as
to
the
price
we
will
leave
it
and
thou
thyself
shalt
name
it
at
the
end
for
maybe
didst
thou
know
the
price
thou
wouldst
hesitate
to
buy
at
all
then
he
put
his
hand
into
his
breast
and
drew
out
a
little
flask
and
he
held
that
little
crystal
flask
up
in
the
air
looking
for
a
ray
of
light
and
when
he
could
not
find
one
that
old
man
muttered
under
his
breath
sun
sun
send
me
a
ray
and
at
that
very
moment
there
shot
into
the
room
a
ray
of
light
right
on
the
little
flask
and
then
that
old
man
said
o
king
see
this
is
a
little
of
the
very
essence
of
the
nectar
of
the
moon
where
i
have
been
this
morning
to
fetch
it
from
that
lord
of
herbs
and
the
king
looked
and
lo
there
danced
in
that
little
flask
a
liquor
that
laughed
and
bubbled
and
its
deep
blue
was
exactly
the
same
as
the
colour
of
his
dead
wife
eyes
and
like
them
it
smiled
at
him
changing
from
hue
to
hue
till
it
seemed
to
him
that
those
very
eyes
were
looking
straight
into
his
own
out
of
the
little
flask
and
quickly
he
put
out
his
hand
and
snatched
it
and
took
the
stopper
from
its
mouth
and
there
came
from
it
a
perfume
that
carried
to
his
nostrils
the
scent
of
his
dead
wife
hair
and
his
brain
reeled
and
he
put
it
hastily
to
his
lips
to
drink
and
as
he
did
so
suddenly
there
came
into
his
head
a
thought
and
he
paused
in
the
very
act
looking
at
that
old
merchant
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
he
said
to
himself
ha
what
if
this
old
seeming
merchant
were
an
emissary
of
those
foes
of
mine
whom
i
defeated
to
give
me
a
deadly
draught
or
even
so
what
matter
let
me
drink
quickly
the
more
poisonous
the
better
for
life
without
her
will
not
be
worse
even
when
turned
to
death
and
then
at
a
single
gulp
he
drank
the
contents
of
the
flask
and
instantly
he
sank
back
and
lay
on
the
cushions
on
which
he
fell
buried
in
a
magic
sleep
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
the
king
slept
that
old
merchant
stooped
down
and
squatted
quickly
on
the
floor
with
his
two
hands
grounded
between
his
feet
and
his
knees
reaching
to
his
ears
and
there
he
remained
with
closed
eyes
couched
in
the
pitcher
posture
like
a
lonely
crane
and
still
as
if
he
had
been
painted
on
the
wall
he
had
no
turban
on
in
the
east
on
entering
a
house
the
head
remains
covered
it
is
the
shoes
which
are
removed
love
love
i
but
the
king
soul
rose
out
of
his
body
like
a
snake
escaping
from
its
slough
and
he
hovered
for
only
a
single
instant
over
that
empty
shell
of
him
lying
loaded
with
priceless
gems
on
the
floor
below
and
then
shot
up
into
the
blue
sky
like
a
flame
parted
from
its
wick
and
as
he
flew
like
a
thought
through
space
going
like
the
wind
he
knew
not
where
the
king
said
to
himself
ha
so
then
i
was
not
deceived
certainly
that
old
impostor
was
not
a
merchant
but
a
secret
agent
of
my
foes
and
now
i
am
dead
beyond
a
doubt
and
that
delicious
poison
was
as
speedy
as
it
was
beautiful
and
sweet
and
now
i
can
say
farewell
to
life
without
regret
and
yet
i
should
like
to
know
where
in
the
world
i
can
be
going
so
as
he
floated
in
the
air
bathed
in
unutterable
peace
there
came
over
his
mounting
soul
a
feeling
of
supreme
disdain
and
loathing
for
his
body
that
was
lying
down
below
and
he
said
to
himself
as
he
closed
his
eyes
ah
joy
for
i
have
left
behind
that
wretched
sheath
with
all
its
poor
surroundings
and
its
miserable
mundane
ties
i
have
emerged
as
it
were
from
a
charnel
ground
and
surely
that
divine
liquor
was
as
that
old
vendor
said
a
very
potent
essence
of
nectar
and
celestial
wine
mixed
of
the
icy
camphor
and
the
oozy
juices
of
the
moon
for
i
feel
like
one
intoxicated
and
i
swim
as
it
were
in
perfume
whose
pungent
and
excessive
sweetness
almost
robs
me
of
my
giddied
sense
and
i
lie
on
the
azure
ether
as
if
on
a
silken
couch
poised
as
it
were
between
earth
and
heaven
and
yet
i
seem
to
soar
like
some
in
the
sky
then
after
a
while
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
round
and
saw
himself
alone
in
the
vault
of
space
surrounded
by
the
stars
and
he
was
rushing
like
a
comet
through
the
mansions
of
the
moon
and
he
saw
chitrá
and
swáti
and
rohini
and
the
hunter
and
the
rest
and
far
in
the
north
the
polar
star
and
he
looked
down
on
the
seven
rishis
and
saw
far
below
him
the
icy
summits
of
the
snowy
mountain
with
the
yellow
digit
of
the
moon
clinging
to
the
peak
of
kailas
like
the
earth
of
old
on
the
horn
of
the
holy
boar
and
then
suddenly
memory
pierced
him
like
a
needle
and
he
cried
out
alas
i
am
still
alone
and
in
this
respect
even
death
has
brought
no
change
and
what
then
is
the
use
of
death
if
it
does
not
restore
me
to
my
wife
and
what
is
the
use
of
this
rushing
speed
for
i
am
hurrying
against
my
will
into
the
very
zenith
of
infinite
space
and
even
as
he
spoke
he
stopped
and
hung
in
the
air
like
a
fleck
of
cloud
and
strange
as
if
the
very
thought
had
produced
her
suddenly
he
found
his
wife
in
his
arms
and
as
her
own
arms
glided
around
his
neck
and
her
bosom
beat
against
his
own
his
hair
stood
on
end
with
amazement
and
delight
and
he
heard
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
throbbing
like
thunder
through
the
realms
of
space
and
just
as
he
was
going
to
speak
she
stopped
his
mouth
by
kissing
him
with
soft
lips
opening
into
a
smile
and
eyes
that
reflected
the
colour
of
the
sky
and
she
said
quick
let
us
lose
no
time
then
he
said
ah
couldst
thou
die
leaving
me
without
thee
in
that
hell
below
then
she
said
again
how
can
mortals
disobey
when
destiny
decrees
it
was
from
necessity
that
i
left
thee
and
not
from
choice
but
let
us
quickly
make
the
most
of
a
little
time
granted
only
by
the
favour
of
the
god
who
has
the
moon
in
his
hair
and
destined
to
end
and
disappear
almost
as
soon
as
it
has
begun
dost
thou
remember
how
we
met
and
saw
each
other
first
of
all
away
in
the
wood
below
come
back
now
once
more
with
me
and
let
us
live
and
love
again
and
taste
the
nectar
of
repetition
before
we
part
to
meet
no
more
and
instantly
the
king
lost
his
senses
and
lay
in
a
dream
within
a
dream
and
as
they
floated
in
each
other
arms
between
the
heaven
and
the
earth
the
past
rose
up
out
of
the
dark
before
him
spread
like
a
picture
before
his
eyes
and
breathed
like
a
tale
into
his
ear
three
things
are
essentially
associated
in
sanskrit
poetry
with
the
moon
icy
cold
camphor
and
the
medicinal
virtue
of
drugs
says
the
are
the
of
virtue
enjoyed
in
heaven
dropping
in
visible
orion
the
great
bear
wishnu
who
in
his
third
incarnation
became
a
boar
to
support
the
earth
jagadisha
hare
ii
sprung
from
the
mud
and
once
again
he
rode
through
the
forest
at
headlong
speed
and
the
trees
flew
by
him
like
frightened
shadows
while
his
horse
ran
on
and
carried
him
swiftly
whither
it
would
into
the
forest
depths
and
then
at
last
it
stopped
short
on
the
very
edge
of
a
great
river
close
to
an
aged
banyan
tree
whose
hanging
roots
dropped
from
the
branches
to
the
ground
and
with
their
network
almost
hid
a
little
ruined
shrine
whose
roof
their
pillars
pierced
and
split
and
whose
steps
ran
down
into
the
stream
beneath
their
sacred
shade
where
the
quiet
water
was
littered
thick
with
lotus
flowers
and
floating
withered
leaves
and
there
he
fell
from
his
horse
back
and
threw
himself
upon
the
ground
and
he
and
his
horse
together
slaked
their
intolerable
thirst
with
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
aught
till
they
had
drunk
their
fill
and
then
with
a
wisp
of
leaves
and
grass
he
began
to
wipe
the
foam
and
sweat
from
the
quivering
limbs
of
that
noble
horse
dearer
to
him
till
that
very
moment
than
anything
else
on
earth
so
as
he
stood
wholly
intent
on
his
horse
and
his
work
he
heard
behind
him
a
little
rustle
and
a
low
cry
and
he
looked
round
and
in
that
instant
like
a
flash
of
lightning
he
utterly
forgot
his
horse
and
himself
and
everything
else
in
the
three
worlds
for
there
standing
a
little
way
off
under
that
old
fig
was
one
who
resembled
the
guardian
spirit
of
that
virgin
enchanted
beauty
caught
in
the
very
act
of
changing
into
a
feminine
form
and
leaving
him
in
doubt
as
he
gazed
whether
she
was
a
woman
or
a
tree
or
a
being
mixed
of
both
for
the
coarse
red
bark
that
clothed
her
left
bare
her
arms
and
feet
which
were
shaped
like
those
of
darling
and
it
cased
and
swathed
her
soft
round
limbs
allowing
them
to
escape
like
the
calyx
of
a
new
young
flower
or
a
rough
hard
husk
on
the
very
point
of
bursting
open
by
reason
of
the
ripeness
of
the
tempting
fruit
of
womanhood
hardly
to
be
held
within
and
a
spray
of
blue
convolvulus
hung
twining
all
about
her
trailing
like
a
creeper
from
her
hair
which
was
twisted
up
into
a
great
dark
knot
on
the
very
top
of
her
pretty
head
and
hung
there
like
a
purple
bank
of
out
of
whose
shadow
her
great
blue
eyes
looked
round
as
the
moon
with
wonder
at
the
thing
they
saw
before
them
and
her
chin
was
very
pointed
shaped
like
a
leaf
and
over
it
the
god
had
set
the
seal
of
his
bow
in
her
face
black
in
the
of
her
brow
and
red
in
her
juicy
lips
and
astonishment
flushed
her
cheeks
like
fruits
with
a
spot
of
damask
blush
like
bloom
and
a
single
lotus
red
as
blood
nestled
in
the
little
hollow
dip
between
the
mounds
of
her
rising
breasts
upland
hills
where
the
robber
love
lay
lurking
to
spoil
the
traveller
of
his
heart
and
the
sweeping
curve
of
her
heavy
hips
stole
the
eyes
of
the
king
away
from
her
slender
waist
till
it
came
to
an
end
in
the
nook
of
her
knee
and
her
left
hand
rested
gently
on
a
pillar
of
the
tree
while
her
right
was
stretched
before
her
bending
back
palm
upwards
with
all
its
fingers
spread
till
the
tip
of
its
forefinger
just
touched
her
lower
lip
and
love
fished
for
the
king
soul
with
her
lovely
wrist
and
arm
and
took
it
in
their
net
and
she
was
standing
bolt
upright
poised
like
a
flower
on
her
left
foot
toes
with
her
right
foot
just
behind
it
exactly
like
a
graceful
fawn
suddenly
frozen
into
stone
when
running
at
its
utmost
speed
by
the
sight
of
danger
in
its
path
for
she
stood
absolutely
still
save
that
the
lotus
on
her
breast
was
lifted
quickly
up
and
down
by
the
flutter
of
the
on
which
it
swam
so
they
two
stood
still
as
death
each
thunderstruck
by
the
vision
like
a
panther
and
its
prey
and
then
at
last
after
a
time
that
seemed
to
each
in
spite
of
its
length
but
a
single
instant
for
each
was
lost
in
the
other
standing
on
the
threshold
of
where
years
are
moments
and
time
lies
dead
she
spoke
and
broke
the
spell
and
she
said
softly
it
is
a
man
surely
thou
art
a
man
and
the
king
said
with
a
smile
o
maid
what
else
then
she
said
again
and
thy
companion
what
is
he
and
the
king
said
he
is
a
horse
then
she
clapped
her
hands
together
and
exclaimed
as
she
held
them
joined
ah
stand
still
a
little
longer
and
let
me
watch
both
him
and
thee
for
i
have
never
seen
before
either
a
horse
or
a
man
so
he
stood
still
as
she
desired
and
as
she
watched
him
he
watched
her
and
her
blue
eyes
rested
on
him
and
entered
into
his
soul
and
shook
it
so
that
he
began
to
tremble
all
over
with
the
horror
of
extreme
delight
and
he
said
to
himself
i
too
i
too
see
a
woman
for
the
very
first
time
in
all
my
life
which
till
this
very
moment
has
been
wasted
and
empty
and
worthless
and
contemptible
and
without
a
point
ha
i
am
like
a
dark
black
night
that
has
suddenly
been
flooded
with
the
rapture
of
a
golden
sun
o
hail
o
bright
great
god
in
the
form
of
that
beautiful
thing
before
me
that
fills
me
with
astonishment
and
laughter
and
supreme
delight
and
presently
he
said
o
thou
with
the
blue
flowers
in
thy
hair
and
the
blue
wonder
in
thy
enormous
eyes
that
resemble
those
of
a
child
how
can
it
be
that
in
a
world
so
full
of
them
thou
shouldst
never
yet
have
set
those
eyes
on
either
a
man
or
a
horse
then
she
started
as
if
from
a
dream
and
she
came
up
close
to
him
and
raised
her
hand
as
though
she
would
touch
his
arm
and
barely
touched
it
with
a
touch
like
that
of
a
leaf
which
struck
the
king
like
a
heavy
blow
and
she
said
looking
up
at
him
doubtfully
but
o
thou
great
beautiful
man
how
should
i
see
either
for
out
of
this
wood
i
never
was
and
into
it
nothing
ever
comes
and
in
it
are
only
its
own
trees
with
the
flowers
and
the
river
and
the
forest
beasts
and
my
father
and
myself
then
the
king
said
thy
father
and
is
not
he
a
man
and
she
said
nay
if
thou
art
he
is
not
for
he
is
old
very
old
and
smaller
even
than
myself
and
his
hair
and
beard
are
thin
and
white
and
his
arms
and
legs
are
rough
as
bark
and
dry
and
thin
as
sticks
and
he
sits
always
stiff
and
silent
plunged
in
meditation
resembling
the
stump
of
an
ancient
tree
and
it
is
the
same
as
if
he
were
not
alive
and
if
thou
wilt
i
will
show
him
to
thee
a
little
way
within
the
wood
and
yet
it
were
better
not
for
it
would
but
distract
his
meditation
but
thou
art
tall
and
straight
and
strong
and
glorious
and
young
like
me
and
yet
far
bigger
than
myself
for
see
how
even
on
tiptoe
i
reach
hardly
to
thy
shoulder
and
thy
hair
is
like
the
lion
mane
and
thou
art
like
him
to
look
at
and
wonderful
in
every
way
and
such
as
i
could
never
have
believed
for
often
i
have
thought
of
men
and
wondered
what
they
could
be
like
but
never
dreamed
of
one
like
thee
look
only
at
my
hand
and
thine
or
at
my
arm
or
foot
and
thine
and
see
how
small
and
weak
a
thing
i
am
compared
with
thee
and
the
king
looked
at
her
as
she
spoke
and
when
she
ended
he
began
to
laugh
for
very
joy
and
he
said
o
beautiful
little
creature
thou
dost
not
know
thy
own
strength
nor
where
it
lies
but
how
as
to
thy
mother
hadst
thou
indeed
a
mother
or
didst
thou
not
rather
grow
like
a
flower
out
of
some
forest
tree
then
she
said
nay
i
had
a
mother
but
alas
long
ago
she
went
away
before
i
can
remember
for
she
was
a
heavenly
apsaras
whom
indra
sent
down
here
below
to
tempt
my
father
in
this
wood
and
turn
him
from
his
penance
and
she
came
and
stayed
with
him
awhile
and
afterwards
she
went
away
flying
up
to
heaven
and
leaving
me
behind
her
with
my
father
in
the
wood
and
the
king
said
i
do
not
blame
thy
father
what
wonder
indeed
if
she
overcame
his
resolution
did
she
resemble
her
future
daughter
even
a
very
little
and
thy
words
require
no
other
witness
to
their
truth
except
thyself
for
beyond
a
doubt
thou
art
the
very
daughter
of
an
apsaras
then
she
said
and
hast
thou
ever
seen
an
apsaras
and
the
king
laughed
and
he
said
nay
not
until
this
moment
but
come
now
let
me
only
tether
my
horse
to
yonder
tree
and
then
if
thou
wilt
we
will
sit
and
talk
together
and
i
will
be
thy
playfellow
and
will
tell
thee
things
that
thou
dost
not
know
and
thou
shall
tell
me
of
nothing
but
thyself
then
she
said
joyfully
ah
tie
him
and
come
quickly
and
the
king
stood
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
he
said
sweet
and
art
thou
not
afraid
of
me
and
she
looked
at
him
enquiringly
with
no
shadow
of
suspicion
and
said
of
what
should
i
be
afraid
for
art
thou
not
a
man
and
which
of
the
creator
creatures
injures
its
own
kind
and
the
king
gazed
into
her
soul
through
the
window
of
her
clear
and
smiling
eyes
and
again
he
laughed
aloud
for
sheer
delight
and
he
said
to
himself
ha
exquisite
is
her
intoxicating
simplicity
in
that
she
does
not
know
that
man
alone
is
the
exception
to
her
rule
and
then
he
said
sweet
forest
flower
what
if
i
were
tempted
to
pluck
thee
and
carry
thee
away
with
me
on
my
horse
and
yet
fear
nothing
for
thou
art
very
right
and
i
am
of
all
the
creator
creatures
the
one
who
would
be
most
loth
to
do
thee
harm
and
men
were
made
strong
by
the
creator
for
this
very
reason
to
guard
such
wonderful
weak
things
as
thee
and
he
said
to
himself
now
let
my
followers
only
not
find
me
till
the
evening
and
by
the
favour
of
the
deity
i
will
win
the
trust
of
this
bewitching
maiden
and
get
her
to
come
away
with
me
or
if
not
i
will
stay
in
the
wood
with
her
for
ever
becoming
for
her
sake
like
one
of
these
forest
trees
rooted
to
the
spot
and
then
he
took
his
horse
and
tied
him
to
the
tree
and
then
they
went
together
and
sat
down
upon
the
steps
that
ran
down
into
the
river
he
on
one
and
she
on
another
just
below
the
hindoo
aphrodite
the
kámalátá
is
commonly
described
as
red
this
was
perhaps
some
kind
of
ipomæa
allied
to
the
great
white
of
ceylon
an
old
told
me
that
he
saw
on
one
occasion
a
panther
stalking
a
goat
as
soon
as
they
saw
each
other
they
both
stood
so
long
that
at
last
the
goat
concluded
his
panther
was
a
mere
illusion
and
recommenced
his
dinner
browsing
with
unruffled
mind
he
would
have
paid
dear
for
his
simplicity
had
not
his
crafty
stalker
been
this
time
stalked
himself
these
ancient
forest
hermits
who
lived
alone
in
jungle
doing
penance
and
eating
nothing
are
one
of
the
conventions
of
hindoo
fairy
stories
such
a
one
like
the
mediæval
saint
bundle
of
bones
whose
breath
corrupts
the
world
before
his
generally
has
a
daughter
to
whose
rare
beauty
he
forms
the
contrast
that
sharp
fierce
contrast
which
is
the
essence
of
the
east
like
life
and
death
is
a
common
sanskrit
word
for
a
woman
indra
is
represented
as
jealous
of
all
ascetics
lest
they
should
reach
his
total
of
century
of
but
his
battle
with
raghu
on
this
head
ended
in
a
compromise
canto
iii
purusha
and
prakriti
and
then
for
a
little
while
he
sat
in
silence
looking
now
at
the
river
and
now
at
her
but
she
gazed
at
him
with
great
eyes
that
never
left
him
for
a
moment
and
saw
nothing
but
himself
and
suddenly
he
said
to
her
how
long
is
it
since
i
met
thee
in
the
wood
then
she
said
it
is
but
a
single
moment
then
he
said
thou
art
utterly
mistaken
it
is
more
than
many
thousand
years
and
as
she
looked
at
him
in
wonder
he
exclaimed
ha
there
it
is
again
and
o
how
beautiful
thou
art
o
thine
eyes
are
full
of
wonder
and
my
soul
is
full
of
joy
dear
child
see
yonder
is
the
river
flowing
as
it
has
been
flowing
ever
since
it
first
began
and
here
am
i
to
thee
the
first
and
only
man
for
thou
hast
never
seen
another
and
there
art
thou
for
me
the
only
woman
and
her
very
type
and
soul
and
like
the
ancient
soul
of
man
i
have
been
wandering
about
forlorn
and
wretched
and
lonely
in
the
dark
without
thee
and
now
at
last
i
have
found
in
thee
my
prakriti
since
thou
art
the
very
spirit
of
the
beauty
of
this
wood
incarnate
in
a
woman
lovely
form
and
as
i
look
at
thee
laughter
seems
to
fill
my
soul
for
joy
that
i
have
found
thee
and
i
feel
as
if
like
thee
i
had
suddenly
become
a
child
whereas
before
i
was
a
man
and
all
this
has
come
about
in
the
moment
since
we
met
a
moment
which
is
like
a
door
opening
on
one
life
and
closing
on
another
and
it
resembles
the
beginning
and
the
end
then
she
said
i
do
not
understand
thee
yet
speak
on
without
stopping
for
i
could
look
at
thee
and
listen
to
thy
voice
for
ever
and
the
king
said
if
thou
dost
not
understand
no
matter
and
possibly
i
am
speaking
at
random
words
without
a
meaning
for
thy
great
eyes
deprive
me
of
my
reason
and
i
know
not
very
well
what
i
say
but
now
it
is
thy
turn
and
tell
me
what
dost
thou
do
with
thyself
alone
in
this
empty
wood
hast
thou
companions
other
than
myself
then
she
said
i
have
for
companions
the
deer
of
the
forest
and
the
parrots
that
live
in
this
great
tree
and
the
peacock
that
thou
seest
yonder
on
the
temple
wall
and
the
crows
that
come
to
eat
the
daily
offering
and
the
flowers
which
i
water
and
wear
woven
in
my
hair
and
i
have
many
things
to
do
for
sometimes
i
ramble
in
the
wood
and
hunt
for
flowers
and
watch
the
monkeys
and
the
squirrels
that
play
in
the
trees
and
when
i
am
tired
i
sit
still
playing
with
my
hair
and
rolling
and
unrolling
it
for
it
is
longer
than
i
am
myself
and
a
trouble
and
a
hindrance
to
me
till
i
knot
it
up
thus
out
of
the
way
on
the
top
of
my
head
like
my
father
and
sometimes
i
go
and
see
my
father
but
i
am
afraid
of
him
for
though
his
body
is
there
his
soul
is
almost
always
absent
from
the
body
and
sometimes
i
sit
by
the
river
when
the
wind
is
still
and
watch
in
its
mirror
the
clouds
that
float
in
the
blue
sky
far
below
like
the
swans
upon
its
wave
and
the
river
itself
is
a
friend
to
me
for
every
day
i
bathe
in
it
and
i
often
sit
and
wonder
whence
it
comes
and
where
it
goes
and
look
to
see
what
it
carries
down
and
in
the
rainy
season
it
changes
and
grows
red
and
angry
and
murmurs
and
chafes
and
swells
till
it
reaches
to
the
very
foot
of
the
tree
and
sometimes
when
the
moon
is
full
i
hide
in
the
hollow
trees
at
night
and
peep
out
at
the
elephants
as
they
wander
down
to
drink
and
the
king
said
but
do
the
other
animals
not
molest
thee
then
she
said
nay
for
they
dare
not
for
they
all
know
my
father
well
who
understands
their
language
and
has
warned
them
and
they
fear
him
lest
he
should
curse
them
if
they
harmed
me
and
keep
them
from
ever
rising
up
into
humanity
being
prisoned
for
ever
by
the
power
of
his
curse
in
the
dungeon
of
their
creeping
bodies
and
the
king
said
with
emphasis
aye
they
who
should
injure
thee
would
indeed
deserve
to
be
immured
for
all
eternity
in
the
lowest
of
all
living
forms
and
i
thank
thy
excellent
old
father
for
preserving
thee
under
the
shadow
of
his
awful
curse
and
yet
for
all
this
surely
thy
life
was
lonely
didst
thou
never
long
for
a
companion
of
thine
own
kind
such
a
playfellow
for
instance
as
myself
then
she
said
though
i
knew
it
not
before
yet
now
that
thou
art
come
i
see
that
i
was
lonely
for
often
i
used
to
watch
myself
reflected
in
the
water
and
talk
to
my
image
and
wish
that
it
could
answer
me
and
sometimes
in
the
moonlight
i
would
play
with
my
shadow
and
wish
oh
so
much
that
it
could
come
to
life
and
often
i
used
to
long
not
knowing
what
i
wanted
but
now
i
am
very
sure
that
it
was
thou
and
when
i
look
at
thee
and
hear
thy
voice
i
can
not
understand
how
i
could
have
lived
without
thee
for
thou
art
like
another
self
made
visible
in
a
human
form
and
yet
thou
art
other
and
more
than
that
first
self
which
is
i
and
the
king
gazed
at
her
with
fire
in
his
veins
and
he
said
to
himself
she
is
innocence
itself
in
a
virgin
form
of
matchless
and
incomparable
beauty
and
speaks
without
understanding
the
meaning
of
her
own
words
for
love
lies
hiding
lurking
in
her
soul
and
yet
she
does
not
know
it
and
yet
though
she
does
not
i
know
well
and
only
too
well
now
what
it
is
to
be
in
love
for
she
burns
my
heart
like
a
flame
all
the
more
that
she
is
utterly
unconscious
of
the
power
of
her
own
beauty
and
then
he
said
canst
thou
tell
me
this
say
wouldst
thou
rather
that
i
were
in
very
truth
the
double
of
thyself
like
thy
image
in
the
water
a
woman
and
not
a
man
and
she
answered
without
hesitation
nay
it
is
better
as
it
is
and
the
king
trembled
with
joy
and
he
said
yet
why
then
she
pondered
for
a
while
and
then
she
said
i
can
not
tell
and
yet
i
feel
that
i
would
rather
have
thee
different
from
myself
than
the
same
and
yet
i
know
not
why
but
what
does
it
matter
why
since
it
is
better
as
it
is
and
the
king
said
with
emotion
sweet
thou
art
right
aye
it
is
far
better
and
it
does
not
matter
why
and
as
he
spoke
there
came
a
murmur
and
a
rushing
sound
in
the
air
and
he
looked
up
in
terror
and
listened
and
exclaimed
ah
what
is
that
then
she
said
it
is
nothing
but
the
sighing
of
the
wind
in
the
hollows
of
the
young
bamboos
purusha
and
prakriti
answer
in
a
sense
to
our
adam
and
eve
as
the
germans
would
say
the
and
of
the
world
ascetics
wear
their
hair
twisted
in
a
knot
in
imitation
of
the
prince
of
them
all
maheshwara
when
ovid
contrasted
the
of
man
with
that
of
the
animals
he
gave
expression
to
the
idea
that
underlies
the
curious
sanskrit
term
for
the
the
iv
bubbles
and
the
king
sighed
also
with
relief
for
he
feared
that
his
followers
had
found
him
in
the
wood
and
then
he
said
hast
thou
a
name
then
she
said
i
have
only
the
name
which
was
my
mother
and
the
king
said
what
was
that
then
she
said
long
ago
when
my
father
first
saw
my
mother
in
the
wood
she
was
standing
by
a
bush
which
had
just
burst
into
blossom
all
over
as
if
by
the
touch
of
her
foot
and
the
bees
were
humming
and
bustling
eagerly
all
about
it
and
her
as
if
they
wished
to
kiss
her
and
my
father
saw
it
and
he
called
her
by
a
name
of
his
own
that
has
come
by
inheritance
also
to
me
for
my
father
has
never
called
me
anything
else
and
the
king
said
and
what
then
was
the
name
and
she
said
alichumbitá
and
the
king
clapped
his
hands
and
exclaimed
certainly
thy
father
is
admirable
and
thy
name
appropriate
and
sure
i
am
that
there
must
be
more
than
the
name
of
relationship
between
that
happy
bush
and
thee
and
i
am
tempted
to
believe
that
thy
story
of
an
apsaras
was
false
and
that
thou
hadst
for
a
mother
no
other
than
the
very
indwelling
spirit
of
that
bush
then
she
said
nay
my
mother
was
an
apsaras
and
the
king
exclaimed
how
shall
i
believe
thee
for
already
i
am
beginning
to
doubt
whether
thou
ever
hadst
either
mother
or
father
and
wert
not
rather
directly
compounded
by
the
deity
himself
in
the
form
of
a
bee
going
from
flower
to
flower
and
culling
thy
composition
out
of
every
flower
fragrant
essence
and
every
painted
bloom
and
she
said
laughing
and
what
then
was
thy
composition
and
the
king
looked
at
her
joyously
and
said
the
deity
was
thy
creator
and
thou
art
mine
for
i
never
lived
until
this
moment
and
this
is
all
thy
doing
thou
hast
found
me
like
an
empty
shell
and
filled
me
with
colour
and
emotion
and
the
salt
of
beauty
and
the
sound
of
laughter
and
the
tossing
to
and
fro
of
the
waves
of
pleasure
and
delight
now
put
me
to
thy
ear
and
i
shall
echo
like
the
sea
then
she
said
once
more
i
do
not
understand
and
the
king
said
o
ocean
no
matter
but
thy
shell
must
murmur
being
full
of
thee
whether
it
will
or
no
and
yet
this
at
least
now
thou
dost
surely
understand
that
i
was
right
and
that
ages
have
elapsed
since
we
met
each
other
a
little
while
ago
in
the
wood
for
i
have
utterly
forgotten
every
fragment
of
my
life
that
went
before
and
as
i
said
i
have
begun
to
live
only
since
i
saw
thy
face
and
thou
hast
discovered
that
thy
life
in
the
wood
was
very
lonely
till
i
came
and
it
is
as
though
we
had
both
been
sleeping
and
had
just
waked
up
and
now
we
are
playfellows
and
i
will
be
king
and
thou
shall
be
queen
or
hast
thou
never
heard
of
kings
and
queens
then
she
said
nay
i
have
heard
for
formerly
before
my
father
became
so
utterly
devoted
to
asceticism
he
used
to
tell
me
stories
and
in
almost
every
story
there
was
a
king
and
queen
then
the
king
said
and
if
then
i
were
king
wouldst
thou
come
away
with
me
and
be
my
queen
and
she
laughed
and
said
but
what
sort
of
queen
should
i
be
that
know
nothing
of
the
duties
and
behaviour
of
a
queen
then
he
said
sweet
little
queen
although
thou
dost
not
know
it
thy
qualifications
for
the
post
of
queen
are
such
that
they
could
not
be
surpassed
and
the
duties
are
easy
to
be
learned
and
the
pleasures
more
than
thou
couldst
dream
only
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
thee
what
they
are
or
if
thou
wilt
i
will
draw
thee
a
picture
in
the
air
and
hold
it
up
before
thee
to
show
thee
as
in
a
mirror
thy
life
as
a
queen
and
give
thee
a
foretaste
of
its
nectar
hast
thou
never
watched
the
bubbles
on
the
surface
of
the
stream
dost
thou
not
know
how
every
bubble
is
like
a
little
heaven
and
glows
for
a
moment
with
every
colour
of
the
sky
and
bursts
but
the
sky
remains
so
is
it
with
my
picture
for
like
a
bubble
it
will
burst
as
soon
as
painted
being
only
words
but
the
heaven
which
it
shows
thee
in
its
mirror
shall
be
thine
as
long
as
life
endures
then
she
said
draw
then
thy
picture
and
let
me
see
thy
heaven
and
she
settled
herself
to
listen
leaning
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
and
looking
at
the
king
so
sagely
that
he
shook
with
agitation
so
intense
was
his
desire
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
he
exclaimed
blue
eyes
come
and
be
my
queen
and
i
will
put
thee
in
a
palace
and
build
it
for
thee
seven
stories
high
of
ebony
and
sandalwood
and
of
silver
and
of
gold
o
come
and
be
my
queen
and
thou
shalt
walk
on
pavements
more
worthy
of
thy
little
feet
than
this
rough
ground
on
marble
of
many
colours
and
on
floors
of
precious
stones
only
be
my
queen
and
i
will
strip
thee
of
thy
bark
and
wrap
thee
in
silky
webs
and
tissues
coloured
like
the
rainbow
till
like
the
moon
behind
a
filmy
cloud
thy
symmetry
shall
borrow
beauty
from
veils
of
gossamer
and
envelopes
of
woven
gauze
ah
come
with
me
and
be
my
little
queen
and
i
will
load
thy
neck
and
arms
with
jewels
and
thou
shall
play
with
heaps
of
pearl
and
coral
and
all
the
riches
of
the
sea
aye
shouldst
thou
prick
thy
finger
i
will
mend
it
with
a
ruby
and
shouldst
thou
drop
a
tear
i
will
redeem
it
with
a
diamond
and
try
in
vain
to
match
with
turquoise
or
or
opal
the
colour
of
thine
eyes
ah
come
and
slaves
shall
serve
my
dainty
queen
with
food
on
golden
plates
and
snow
cold
drinks
in
crystal
cups
and
when
thou
wilt
pour
music
in
thy
little
ear
and
elephants
shall
carry
thee
about
or
thou
shall
ride
on
horses
or
float
on
silent
pools
starred
like
the
sky
with
a
multitude
of
lotuses
or
lie
on
couches
softer
than
a
flower
fanned
in
the
heat
of
noon
with
scented
leaves
or
listening
at
midnight
to
the
moonstones
oozing
as
they
swing
in
the
trellised
frames
ah
come
and
be
my
queen
for
i
can
not
do
without
thee
and
all
that
i
have
said
is
nothing
for
it
is
only
the
casket
for
thy
soul
for
i
will
be
there
and
serve
thee
all
day
long
upon
my
knees
ah
i
will
take
thy
soul
and
steep
it
in
elixir
and
drown
it
in
the
perfume
and
the
fragrance
of
stories
and
of
dreams
and
dye
it
with
the
colour
strained
from
the
subtle
essences
of
lakes
of
passion
and
emotion
lying
in
the
distant
land
beyond
the
blue
horizon
where
the
earth
and
heaven
meet
aye
i
would
turn
the
three
worlds
upside
down
only
to
be
near
thee
and
watch
the
shadow
of
the
pleasures
i
would
find
there
reflected
in
thine
eyes
o
thou
naïvest
and
most
exquisite
of
queens
and
she
watched
him
as
he
spoke
and
when
he
stopped
she
continued
to
look
at
him
in
silence
and
then
to
his
amazement
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
the
colour
rose
a
very
little
in
her
cheek
that
was
overshadowed
by
her
long
soft
lashes
and
she
said
nay
thou
art
only
laughing
at
me
knowing
my
inexperience
and
as
thou
saidst
thy
words
are
only
bubbles
beautiful
and
bursting
as
they
jostle
one
another
and
delusive
nor
is
this
the
kind
of
queen
that
i
would
be
and
the
king
said
with
curiosity
and
what
then
o
maiden
difficult
to
please
is
thy
conception
of
a
queen
and
she
waited
for
a
moment
and
she
said
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
once
my
father
told
me
of
a
queen
very
different
from
thine
and
i
can
not
tell
thee
the
story
as
he
told
it
for
i
am
not
a
as
is
he
but
he
told
me
of
a
king
who
was
set
upon
by
enemies
and
driven
from
his
throne
and
when
all
the
world
abandoned
him
a
single
friend
remained
to
him
and
that
one
was
his
queen
who
followed
him
in
exile
and
lived
with
him
in
poverty
and
wandered
through
the
world
behind
him
like
his
shadow
enjoying
never
one
of
the
pleasures
thou
hast
mentioned
but
sharing
all
his
evil
fortune
a
pleasure
infinitely
greater
than
them
all
and
when
he
died
she
would
not
stay
behind
him
but
followed
him
through
the
fire
into
the
other
world
there
is
a
beautiful
indian
idea
that
the
foot
of
a
pretty
woman
will
cause
a
particular
tree
i
can
not
recollect
which
to
break
into
blossom
by
the
note
that
the
third
syllable
rhymes
not
with
crumb
but
with
room
pronounced
rather
short
v
a
painted
lady
and
the
king
listened
with
amazement
and
when
she
ended
he
looked
at
her
with
eyes
that
glistened
and
a
heart
that
swelled
towards
her
as
she
sat
with
downcast
eyes
as
if
ashamed
of
her
words
before
him
on
the
ground
and
he
struck
his
hands
together
and
exclaimed
to
himself
ha
very
wonderful
is
the
way
of
the
creator
who
teaches
all
his
creatures
the
law
of
their
behaviour
without
the
means
of
any
master
for
this
pure
white
lotus
of
a
maiden
has
understood
without
assistance
and
as
it
were
by
native
instinct
the
whole
duty
of
a
faithful
wife
even
before
she
has
so
much
as
seen
a
man
and
then
he
said
sweet
little
ascetic
apt
pupil
of
a
wise
old
father
whom
thou
dost
resemble
not
only
in
thy
hair
thou
hast
administered
reproof
to
me
deservedly
and
whereas
i
thought
in
my
folly
to
instruct
thee
it
was
i
that
received
a
lesson
in
this
matter
of
the
way
of
queens
and
now
i
see
that
i
spoke
more
truly
than
i
knew
when
i
said
that
thou
wert
admirably
fitted
to
be
a
queen
now
therefore
thou
art
my
and
i
am
thy
disciple
and
thou
shalt
teach
me
all
that
i
do
not
know
begin
then
my
pretty
little
give
me
lessons
for
i
need
them
and
she
laughed
and
blushed
and
said
again
thou
art
laughing
at
me
for
how
could
a
simple
forest
maiden
teach
anything
to
one
who
like
thyself
had
lived
in
cities
and
mixed
with
other
men
and
women
and
the
king
said
quickly
ah
dear
just
for
that
very
reason
is
it
that
thou
hast
already
taught
me
many
things
that
i
never
knew
before
for
they
who
live
in
cities
have
their
souls
tainted
as
it
were
and
poisoned
by
bad
associations
whereas
thine
is
as
pure
as
the
flowers
in
thy
hair
and
therefore
as
thou
hast
taught
me
about
queens
teach
me
also
about
kings
what
should
he
be
like
whom
thou
wouldst
be
willing
to
follow
through
the
world
and
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
turned
away
her
head
and
was
silent
and
as
he
watched
her
the
king
saw
the
colour
rising
on
her
neck
till
it
reached
the
roots
of
her
dark
hair
like
the
flush
of
eve
climbing
the
snowy
summit
of
himalaya
when
day
is
dead
and
he
said
to
himself
in
ecstasy
ha
so
this
pure
digit
of
the
moon
even
in
the
solitary
darkness
of
the
night
before
the
dawn
of
love
has
dreamed
of
a
sun
which
she
has
never
seen
and
o
that
i
could
dare
to
think
myself
the
sunny
lover
corresponding
to
her
dream
destined
to
touch
her
soul
as
my
question
did
her
body
into
red
but
let
me
beware
lest
i
scare
my
timid
fawn
by
a
too
abrupt
approach
and
then
he
said
dear
little
queen
forgive
me
if
i
roused
thy
maiden
shame
by
a
rash
and
curiosity
it
is
enough
for
me
to
know
that
the
king
of
thy
pure
fancy
must
be
worthy
of
his
queen
and
as
much
above
all
other
men
as
thou
art
different
and
above
all
other
women
and
then
with
her
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
ground
she
began
to
draw
upon
the
step
with
her
foot
and
she
said
softly
and
in
what
do
i
differ
from
all
other
women
and
the
king
said
ask
me
rather
in
what
respect
thou
art
the
same
for
thy
points
of
difference
are
so
many
that
it
would
take
long
to
tell
them
all
but
notwithstanding
if
thou
wilt
i
will
try
and
paint
thy
portrait
for
thee
in
contrast
to
the
others
and
hold
thy
image
up
before
thee
reflected
on
the
mirror
of
my
soul
and
she
said
try
for
i
desire
to
learn
how
i
differ
from
the
others
then
he
said
look
then
at
me
that
i
may
see
thee
before
i
begin
and
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
straight
at
him
blushing
a
very
little
and
then
smiled
and
looked
down
and
waited
as
he
spoke
then
the
king
said
every
woman
is
a
woman
and
so
art
thou
and
this
is
what
thou
hast
in
common
with
all
others
of
thy
sex
and
yet
in
every
special
property
of
woman
thou
hast
something
of
thine
own
which
marks
thee
like
a
seal
and
stamps
thee
as
a
thing
distinct
and
peculiar
and
other
than
them
all
for
others
have
blue
eyes
but
thine
are
bluer
and
other
lips
are
red
but
thine
are
redder
and
other
brows
are
black
but
thine
is
blacker
and
other
smiles
are
white
but
thine
o
thine
is
like
a
snowflake
or
the
petal
of
a
new
young
lotus
bud
dark
dark
is
hair
but
thine
is
like
the
midnight
and
many
feet
are
small
but
not
as
thine
are
and
o
thy
arms
are
softer
and
more
rounded
and
thy
waist
is
more
enticing
and
the
two
proud
swelling
sister
milky
foes
upon
thy
breast
more
erect
and
more
provoking
and
yet
thy
step
is
lighter
and
thy
walk
is
more
bewitching
and
thy
voice
murmur
sweeter
and
thy
laughter
more
delicious
and
thy
soul
fresher
and
more
frank
and
thy
heart
it
may
be
harder
than
that
of
any
woman
that
i
have
ever
seen
moreover
all
others
of
thy
sex
are
tame
and
thou
art
wild
then
she
said
what
is
the
distinction
for
i
do
not
understand
and
the
king
said
sweet
i
can
not
tell
thee
and
yet
it
is
a
difference
far
greater
than
all
the
others
put
together
for
all
things
that
are
tame
are
as
it
were
an
incarnation
and
embodiment
of
the
littleness
of
men
but
all
things
that
are
wild
as
thou
art
are
as
it
were
a
portion
of
the
deity
for
thy
behaviour
differs
from
that
of
other
women
as
does
a
wild
vine
gadding
at
its
will
from
the
trained
flowers
in
a
king
garden
and
thy
great
blue
eyes
are
utterly
without
hypocrisy
and
resemble
those
of
a
falcon
or
a
child
and
thou
thyself
art
like
the
young
beautiful
heifer
of
a
wild
white
bull
and
i
know
not
how
to
tell
thee
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
thou
art
wild
and
yet
it
is
just
this
very
quality
in
thee
which
drives
me
to
distraction
but
see
now
the
evening
as
it
falls
and
the
water
of
the
great
river
flowing
with
its
surface
unruffled
by
any
breath
of
wind
see
how
the
cranes
here
and
there
upon
the
brink
are
mirrored
in
its
water
and
yonder
pair
of
swans
are
as
it
were
echoed
by
another
pair
that
swim
below
them
upside
down
and
the
peacock
on
the
temple
wall
glitters
in
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
with
emerald
and
blue
and
gold
now
thou
seemest
as
it
were
a
part
of
it
all
and
as
it
were
the
soul
of
all
this
body
and
like
a
jewel
in
its
proper
setting
and
at
one
with
all
the
creatures
of
the
wood
and
i
begin
to
fear
lest
thou
shouldst
suddenly
plunge
into
the
water
and
disappear
leaving
me
alone
and
as
he
spoke
there
came
again
a
murmur
and
a
rustle
in
the
air
and
he
listened
and
exclaimed
with
anxiety
ha
what
is
that
then
she
said
it
is
only
the
beating
of
the
wings
of
the
waterfowl
returning
to
their
roost
for
the
night
this
single
word
a
common
name
in
sanskrit
for
the
lotus
possesses
an
incomparable
moral
and
æsthetic
mingled
beauty
which
can
only
be
poorly
rendered
in
english
by
five
words
instead
of
one
is
the
word
but
the
meaning
it
covers
is
the
pure
white
lotus
that
springs
out
of
the
thick
black
mire
just
as
the
brightest
rainbow
is
seen
against
the
darkest
cloud
vi
shadows
and
the
king
drew
a
deep
breath
like
a
man
saved
from
a
great
danger
and
she
saw
it
and
said
to
him
thou
art
afraid
of
what
art
thou
afraid
and
the
king
said
ah
dear
i
am
indeed
afraid
but
of
this
alone
lest
something
should
occur
to
cut
short
our
conversation
and
shall
i
not
be
afraid
of
death
for
as
my
life
began
with
the
commencement
of
our
converse
so
its
end
will
be
my
death
and
like
a
miser
the
very
treasure
that
i
worship
fills
me
with
despair
because
the
fear
of
losing
it
mixes
with
the
joy
of
its
possession
and
i
start
at
every
noise
and
as
i
said
before
more
than
anything
i
fear
lest
thou
shouldst
suddenly
escape
into
the
water
and
i
am
sorely
tempted
to
take
hold
of
thee
and
tie
thee
like
my
horse
to
the
tree
to
prevent
thee
from
escaping
then
she
laughed
and
exclaimed
there
is
no
need
for
i
have
no
desire
to
escape
from
thee
and
how
could
i
plunge
into
the
water
unless
i
were
a
fish
then
he
said
dear
did
thy
father
never
tell
thee
of
the
nymphs
that
have
their
homes
beneath
the
water
or
hast
thou
forgotten
what
he
said
or
is
it
as
i
said
that
thou
thyself
art
one
of
them
seeking
to
deceive
me
and
she
said
but
what
should
lead
thee
to
believe
it
and
he
said
every
reason
for
they
are
all
marvellously
beautiful
as
thou
art
and
like
thee
they
suddenly
appear
seated
by
pools
and
streams
and
lure
unhappy
travellers
like
me
to
ruin
and
destruction
then
she
said
and
by
what
means
do
they
destroy
them
and
the
king
said
by
showing
themselves
for
but
an
instant
and
then
disappearing
never
to
return
carrying
away
with
them
the
hearts
of
their
miserable
victims
and
leaving
them
instead
inconsolable
regret
and
lovelorn
longing
for
the
beauty
whose
momentary
vision
robbed
them
of
their
soul
therefore
beware
and
let
me
warn
thee
that
once
having
shown
thyself
thou
art
absolutely
bound
to
remain
with
me
for
ever
otherwise
i
shall
be
utterly
undone
for
if
not
thou
wert
very
wrong
ever
to
have
shown
thyself
at
all
and
deservest
to
be
punished
as
a
deceiver
and
a
thag
then
she
laughed
with
laughter
that
was
music
to
the
king
ear
and
she
said
softly
but
this
is
very
hard
for
how
can
those
poor
help
it
and
is
it
any
fault
of
theirs
if
they
happen
to
be
seen
by
those
who
happen
to
pass
by
and
are
not
blind
nor
was
it
my
fault
if
i
was
seen
by
thee
rather
was
it
thine
for
coming
into
my
wood
upon
thy
horse
then
the
king
said
i
blame
thee
not
at
all
always
provided
that
thou
dost
not
jump
into
the
water
or
leave
me
in
any
other
way
and
she
said
but
is
it
not
rather
i
that
have
to
be
afraid
lest
thou
shouldst
leave
me
is
it
my
sex
only
that
deceives
and
are
there
no
as
well
as
and
the
king
said
eagerly
ah
dear
and
would
it
be
a
grief
to
thee
if
i
should
go
away
and
she
waited
a
little
while
before
she
replied
and
then
she
said
looking
at
him
with
playful
eyes
didst
thou
not
say
thyself
that
this
world
was
full
of
men
and
if
then
one
has
come
into
the
wood
another
may
and
the
king
started
and
he
looked
at
her
with
rapture
and
he
said
to
himself
ha
she
is
provoking
me
and
ah
she
is
delicious
surely
the
very
elements
must
have
in
them
the
nature
of
a
woman
since
even
in
this
empty
wood
this
intoxicating
maiden
has
somehow
or
other
managed
to
acquire
the
coquetry
of
her
sex
most
of
all
charming
there
where
it
was
least
to
be
expected
and
then
he
said
aloud
dear
little
daughter
of
an
apsaras
let
thine
other
man
beware
whoever
he
may
be
for
i
will
set
guards
about
the
wood
like
a
ring
to
put
to
death
whoever
they
may
find
then
she
looked
at
him
a
little
while
and
she
said
see
i
have
told
thee
all
i
have
to
tell
but
thou
hast
told
me
absolutely
nothing
art
thou
then
a
king
to
speak
of
placing
guards
about
the
wood
and
the
king
said
to
himself
ha
she
is
clever
and
has
caught
me
in
a
trap
and
yet
i
will
not
tell
her
who
i
am
for
if
she
knew
she
might
be
dazzled
by
my
kingdom
and
fall
in
love
with
that
rather
than
with
me
and
he
said
surely
as
we
agreed
in
the
beginning
if
thou
art
a
queen
i
must
be
a
king
and
i
will
not
allow
any
other
man
to
tamper
with
my
queen
and
i
am
of
good
caste
and
a
rajpoot
and
not
ashamed
of
my
family
but
what
if
i
were
in
very
truth
a
king
and
banished
wouldst
thou
follow
me
through
the
world
as
thou
saidst
and
she
laughed
and
said
nay
but
i
am
not
yet
thy
queen
and
to
follow
thee
is
not
my
duty
but
that
of
thy
queen
or
queens
and
the
king
looked
at
her
narrowly
and
said
to
himself
is
she
speaking
at
random
or
can
it
be
that
she
is
curious
or
jealous
and
anxious
to
discover
whether
she
has
a
rival
and
he
said
king
or
not
this
is
certain
that
i
neither
have
nor
will
have
any
queen
or
queens
whatever
but
thyself
nor
have
i
ever
seen
any
woman
in
the
world
till
i
came
into
this
wood
that
i
would
wish
to
make
my
wife
and
therefore
tell
me
for
as
yet
thou
hast
not
answered
if
i
were
a
king
indeed
wouldst
thou
come
away
and
be
my
queen
and
she
said
i
am
of
good
family
and
not
independent
and
it
is
not
for
myself
but
for
my
father
to
dispose
of
me
and
then
the
very
instant
she
had
spoken
she
uttered
a
sharp
cry
and
started
to
her
feet
and
stood
and
the
king
leaped
up
in
terror
exclaiming
alas
what
is
the
matter
for
he
thought
she
had
been
bitten
by
a
snake
but
he
looked
and
saw
nothing
and
he
drew
near
her
and
saw
that
she
was
deadly
pale
and
drooping
like
a
flower
left
without
water
in
the
heat
of
noon
and
he
said
again
with
anxiety
alichumbitá
what
is
it
but
she
never
answered
but
stood
silent
gazing
at
the
river
as
though
he
were
not
there
and
the
king
stood
just
beside
her
looking
at
her
with
affection
and
alarm
and
now
the
light
was
changing
into
darkness
for
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
the
western
mountain
and
on
the
trees
across
the
river
the
disc
of
the
was
sitting
waiting
like
a
thief
watching
the
lord
of
day
away
before
stealing
silently
up
into
his
domain
and
far
away
down
the
river
a
solitary
star
was
shining
in
the
south
below
in
the
black
water
and
above
in
the
dark
blue
sky
over
which
great
bats
were
flapping
noiselessly
like
dusky
ghosts
coming
by
night
to
haunt
the
spots
they
loved
as
living
birds
and
the
voices
of
the
forest
day
had
died
away
and
in
their
place
the
insects
of
the
night
were
calling
to
one
another
to
begin
and
all
about
the
shadows
in
the
trees
the
fireflies
were
flitting
in
and
out
and
the
king
heard
his
horse
whinnying
and
pawing
on
the
ground
impatient
at
being
tied
so
long
and
fretting
to
be
gone
no
woman
in
india
even
in
a
fairy
tale
is
ever
independent
and
her
own
mistress
unless
she
belongs
to
a
class
outside
the
pale
of
moral
consideration
vii
twilight
and
still
as
she
did
not
move
at
last
the
king
broke
silence
and
he
said
dear
i
know
not
what
is
wrong
but
i
would
give
my
life
to
save
thee
from
even
a
very
little
pain
and
now
the
day
is
done
and
very
soon
it
will
be
night
dost
thou
not
hear
the
horse
calling
and
telling
me
it
is
time
to
be
away
and
yet
i
can
not
leave
thee
if
i
would
and
now
again
i
ask
thee
wilt
thou
not
come
away
with
me
from
this
dark
wood
and
live
and
play
with
me
for
ever
as
we
have
done
for
in
the
time
that
we
have
been
together
thou
hast
taken
absolute
possession
of
my
soul
and
filled
it
with
thyself
leaving
no
other
room
in
it
so
that
everything
except
thee
is
utterly
ousted
and
forgotten
and
obliterated
and
i
feel
as
if
i
had
known
thee
not
for
an
hour
but
for
a
hundred
thousand
years
and
it
can
not
be
but
that
we
were
king
and
queen
in
many
births
before
and
destined
by
reason
of
the
depth
of
our
devotion
to
meet
again
in
this
one
also
and
i
will
make
thy
life
all
that
i
said
and
more
and
i
will
be
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
thy
other
self
reflecting
thee
as
in
a
mirror
joyous
when
thou
art
joyous
and
sad
when
thou
art
sad
and
if
thou
dost
regret
to
leave
thy
father
and
the
wood
no
matter
for
i
will
bring
thee
back
to
it
as
often
as
thou
wilt
and
we
will
make
this
little
temple
as
it
were
a
pleasure
arbour
to
last
us
till
we
die
and
remind
me
for
ever
of
the
moment
when
i
saw
thy
two
great
eyes
like
two
great
blue
lotus
flowers
looking
at
me
out
of
the
magic
shadow
of
the
wood
and
then
all
at
once
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
and
she
said
sobbing
now
thou
must
go
away
almost
as
soon
as
thou
art
come
why
didst
thou
come
into
the
wood
only
to
destroy
me
for
till
i
saw
thee
i
was
happy
and
i
took
pleasure
in
the
river
and
the
flowers
and
the
trees
but
now
they
are
all
become
hateful
in
my
eyes
for
i
can
not
bear
to
let
thee
go
and
be
without
thee
and
yet
i
can
not
keep
thee
or
go
with
thee
from
the
wood
and
the
king
said
in
despair
alas
and
why
canst
thou
not
come
away
then
she
said
as
my
father
wishes
me
to
marry
so
i
must
but
thy
coming
took
me
by
surprise
and
robbed
me
of
my
reason
and
lost
in
the
joy
of
thy
discovery
and
watching
thee
and
listening
to
thy
voice
i
had
utterly
forgotten
everything
but
thee
and
i
suddenly
remembered
as
i
told
thee
of
my
father
all
about
it
and
now
it
is
a
grief
to
me
that
ever
i
saw
thee
in
the
wood
and
now
all
is
over
and
everything
is
changed
and
thou
must
go
away
at
once
and
leave
me
to
forget
if
i
can
that
ever
i
have
seen
thee
for
i
can
not
disobey
my
father
or
bring
discredit
on
my
family
by
having
anything
to
do
with
thee
for
i
am
intended
for
another
and
the
king
exclaimed
ah
no
it
can
not
be
surely
thou
art
raving
or
who
can
it
be
for
whom
thou
art
preserved
by
thy
father
as
a
deposit
and
a
trust
and
he
said
to
himself
only
let
me
learn
who
it
is
and
i
will
find
him
no
matter
who
and
where
he
is
and
rid
the
earth
of
him
and
get
her
for
myself
then
she
said
far
away
in
the
north
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
there
is
a
king
rudrálaka
by
name
and
one
day
he
will
come
into
the
wood
and
claim
me
for
his
bride
for
so
it
was
revealed
to
my
father
when
he
enquired
of
my
mother
long
ago
to
whom
he
should
give
me
when
i
was
of
age
and
my
mother
went
to
indra
and
asked
him
and
indra
asked
maheshwara
who
knows
the
present
the
future
and
the
past
and
how
can
he
be
deceived
or
how
can
that
which
he
foretold
fail
to
come
to
pass
and
now
i
see
very
well
that
it
was
a
crime
in
me
ever
to
have
had
anything
to
do
with
thee
and
in
the
madness
produced
by
thy
appearance
i
have
acted
in
a
manner
unworthy
of
my
caste
for
i
am
the
promised
bride
of
another
man
and
now
there
is
nothing
but
for
thee
to
go
away
as
quickly
as
thou
canst
and
forget
that
ever
thou
didst
see
me
in
the
wood
and
the
king
stood
still
behind
her
as
she
spoke
filled
with
amazement
and
relief
and
he
watched
her
weeping
with
pride
and
delight
and
he
said
to
himself
certainly
she
is
of
good
family
and
its
very
and
like
a
diamond
of
pure
water
for
she
will
not
come
away
with
me
but
is
faithful
to
her
duty
even
against
her
will
but
once
again
i
will
test
her
like
gold
in
the
fire
before
i
tell
her
who
i
am
but
what
if
she
does
not
stand
the
test
why
then
i
will
forgive
her
for
how
could
i
blame
her
for
yielding
and
allowing
herself
to
be
defeated
in
my
cause
but
if
she
stands
firm
and
resists
me
then
i
shall
know
that
my
pearl
is
priceless
and
my
emerald
without
a
flaw
and
then
he
said
aloud
out
upon
this
rudrálaka
for
he
is
like
a
cloud
that
has
suddenly
intervened
to
cast
a
dark
and
horrid
shadow
over
our
sunny
garden
of
delight
and
an
obstacle
which
only
the
lord
of
obstacles
can
move
and
what
is
this
rudrálaka
to
prevail
over
the
lord
of
the
elephant
face
in
conjunction
with
the
god
who
has
flowers
for
his
bow
and
can
not
i
persuade
thee
to
forget
one
whom
thou
hast
never
even
seen
and
who
is
to
thee
nothing
but
a
name
and
who
knows
even
whether
he
exists
at
all
and
is
not
merely
a
dream
of
thy
father
an
illusion
brought
into
his
aged
head
by
weakness
arising
from
severe
emaciation
and
wilt
thou
then
sacrifice
thy
happiness
and
mine
to
a
dream
and
he
waited
for
a
moment
and
he
said
see
thou
art
undecided
wavering
between
thy
duty
and
my
love
like
a
flower
shaken
by
opposing
breezes
a
flower
thou
art
and
a
flower
shall
decide
for
thee
and
this
red
lotus
which
has
lingered
so
long
near
thy
heart
that
it
must
know
it
and
resembles
it
in
colour
shall
be
the
oracle
of
thy
destiny
and
he
leaned
over
her
and
took
very
gently
without
touching
her
the
lotus
on
her
breast
and
drew
it
away
while
she
offered
no
resistance
and
he
said
one
petal
is
for
thee
and
one
for
me
now
will
i
pluck
the
petals
one
by
one
first
for
thee
and
second
for
myself
and
if
thine
is
the
last
thou
shalt
stay
and
i
will
go
away
without
thee
and
if
mine
thou
shall
cast
away
rudrálaka
like
the
stalk
when
it
is
stripped
of
the
leaves
and
forget
him
and
come
with
me
and
be
my
wife
and
then
one
by
one
he
began
to
strip
the
red
lotus
of
its
leaves
and
let
them
fall
upon
the
ground
saying
as
he
did
so
this
for
thee
this
for
me
and
as
he
counted
she
watched
him
with
tears
sparkling
in
her
eyes
till
only
one
remained
and
he
held
it
out
towards
her
saying
with
a
smile
this
for
me
and
then
all
at
once
she
broke
into
a
laugh
that
was
mingled
with
sobs
and
sorrow
and
indignation
and
she
exclaimed
ah
thou
art
cunning
and
thou
art
very
cruel
thou
knewest
very
well
that
there
were
but
sixteen
petals
on
the
lotus
and
that
thine
must
be
the
last
and
thou
art
unkind
prolonging
my
torture
and
striving
by
unfairness
and
temptation
to
recall
my
resolution
yet
if
i
did
thou
wouldst
only
think
the
worse
of
me
even
though
thine
would
be
the
gain
go
go
quickly
for
i
may
not
come
away
with
thee
and
as
she
spoke
she
turned
paler
than
the
that
opens
in
the
dusk
and
staggered
and
she
leaned
against
a
pillar
of
the
tree
and
her
eyes
shone
in
the
moonlight
and
she
said
very
quietly
go
now
take
thy
horse
and
go
away
and
go
very
quickly
for
the
decision
is
too
hard
for
me
and
i
can
not
bear
it
very
long
and
it
would
be
a
stain
on
thee
to
tempt
any
longer
the
wife
of
another
man
and
the
king
gazed
at
her
struck
with
admiration
and
amazement
and
he
said
to
himself
ha
where
is
the
simple
forest
maiden
who
sat
to
listen
at
my
feet
for
in
her
place
i
see
one
whose
virtue
i
have
roused
and
who
orders
me
to
go
with
the
dignity
of
an
insulted
queen
and
i
stand
before
her
like
a
culprit
rejoicing
inwardly
at
the
failure
of
my
own
attempt
and
as
he
stood
lost
in
wonder
at
her
moonlit
unearthly
beauty
and
ready
to
fall
and
worship
at
her
feet
suddenly
there
fell
upon
his
ear
a
murmur
and
a
rustle
in
the
air
and
he
listened
and
all
at
once
the
horse
began
to
neigh
for
it
was
the
trample
of
horses
and
the
thunder
of
their
hoofs
and
as
they
looked
lo
a
band
of
horsemen
issued
from
the
wood
and
came
towards
them
and
in
a
moment
they
were
surrounded
by
the
attendants
of
the
king
ganesha
and
kama
the
gods
of
good
luck
and
love
certainly
two
formidable
antagonists
it
is
one
of
the
conventions
of
hindoo
poetry
that
the
petals
of
the
lotus
are
eight
or
sixteen
in
number
viii
quintessence
and
then
with
a
cry
alichumbitá
sprang
back
and
stood
in
dismay
on
the
very
brink
of
the
river
looking
from
the
king
to
his
followers
and
back
again
and
the
king
watched
her
with
ecstasy
and
he
said
to
himself
now
could
i
almost
forgive
my
attendants
for
this
exasperating
interruption
for
she
looks
like
a
stag
whose
retreat
has
been
cut
off
by
the
hunters
standing
at
bay
with
every
graceful
limb
quivering
and
poised
on
the
very
verge
of
instant
action
striking
terror
as
it
were
into
even
the
hearts
of
her
pursuers
by
her
magnificent
defiance
and
cowing
them
by
the
startled
pride
of
her
haughty
and
yet
timid
eyes
and
holding
them
as
it
were
spellbound
by
the
beautiful
agitation
incarnate
in
her
form
and
reaching
its
supreme
expression
in
the
deep
heave
of
her
glorious
bosom
and
i
can
see
that
my
followers
are
divided
in
their
minds
for
all
their
respect
for
me
can
not
prevent
them
from
transferring
their
allegiance
to
her
and
doing
homage
to
the
true
deity
manifest
in
her
lovely
shape
ha
beauty
is
the
real
ruler
of
the
three
worlds
and
all
others
are
usurpers
and
pretenders
and
emptiness
and
show
for
if
i
were
unknown
to
them
my
followers
would
pay
me
no
regard
at
all
whereas
they
have
all
become
slaves
to
my
mistress
as
i
did
myself
by
a
single
glance
at
her
goddess
mien
and
then
as
his
attendants
dismounted
from
their
horses
and
stood
before
him
in
attitudes
of
respect
the
king
called
to
his
chief
huntsman
and
he
said
to
him
tell
this
lady
who
they
are
that
stand
before
her
then
that
huntsman
said
with
deference
lady
we
are
a
very
few
of
the
devoted
followers
of
king
rudrálaka
and
having
hunted
for
him
all
day
long
we
pray
now
to
be
forgiven
if
we
have
succeeded
at
last
in
finding
him
only
to
be
troublesome
by
our
intrusion
and
the
king
said
now
go
taking
my
horse
and
wait
for
me
a
little
way
off
yet
not
beyond
a
call
then
those
huntsmen
all
retired
stealing
glances
as
they
went
at
the
king
companion
and
vanished
again
within
the
wood
and
when
they
were
gone
the
king
stood
awhile
in
silence
gazing
with
affection
at
alichumbitá
who
was
lost
in
confusion
and
astonishment
and
then
he
said
now
thou
hast
heard
and
will
thou
now
do
thy
duty
and
obey
thy
father
and
justify
the
great
god
foresight
and
come
away
with
thy
true
husband
and
be
his
queen
or
hast
thou
still
a
horror
of
king
rudrálaka
ah
forgive
me
for
trying
thee
a
thing
which
i
can
not
nevertheless
regret
for
thou
wert
proof
against
my
bribes
and
hast
doubled
the
worth
of
thy
wondrous
beauty
by
exhibiting
the
quality
of
its
inner
soul
and
she
stood
for
a
moment
changing
colour
first
red
and
then
white
as
if
the
blood
which
had
mantled
in
her
face
had
like
those
huntsmen
withdrawn
again
into
the
wood
of
her
heart
from
modesty
at
the
sight
of
him
and
as
he
took
her
by
the
hand
she
hid
her
face
against
his
breast
laughing
as
she
wept
and
raining
as
it
were
nectar
with
her
tears
into
the
heart
of
the
king
so
they
stood
together
in
the
silence
while
the
king
stroked
her
dark
hair
gently
with
his
left
hand
and
at
last
he
said
sweet
little
queen
thou
hast
seen
men
enough
now
for
one
day
know
that
they
are
all
thy
servants
from
the
king
down
and
suddenly
she
raised
her
face
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
were
full
of
smiles
and
tears
and
shyness
and
playfulness
and
blue
colour
and
the
tremble
of
the
moon
and
she
said
canst
thou
tell
of
what
i
thought
as
i
looked
upon
all
those
men
and
he
said
of
what
then
she
said
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
worthy
only
to
be
servants
to
such
as
thee
and
i
saw
that
it
was
as
i
had
thought
and
that
mine
was
a
man
even
among
men
and
then
she
stopped
and
she
said
again
in
a
low
voice
now
if
thou
wilt
i
wilt
give
thee
an
answer
to
that
question
of
thine
which
i
left
unanswered
and
the
king
said
which
and
she
said
dost
thou
not
remember
thou
didst
ask
me
what
was
he
like
whom
i
would
follow
through
the
world
now
canst
thou
guess
or
shall
i
tell
thee
and
the
king
leaned
over
her
bending
her
a
little
back
as
she
lay
in
his
strong
arms
and
as
she
closed
her
eyes
he
kissed
her
trembling
lips
which
shrank
a
little
from
the
touch
of
his
own
and
after
a
while
he
looked
and
saw
heaven
reflected
in
the
eyes
of
his
wife
beneath
him
and
beyond
them
their
two
shadows
clinging
together
black
on
the
moonlit
ground
and
suddenly
he
pointed
and
said
to
her
see
thy
wish
is
gratified
and
thy
shadow
has
come
to
life
and
she
put
both
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
drew
him
down
and
kissed
him
again
and
she
said
it
is
not
my
shadow
but
it
is
i
myself
that
have
come
to
life
and
thou
art
the
life
that
has
come
to
me
and
hadst
thou
gone
away
without
me
i
should
not
be
living
now
for
i
would
have
thrown
myself
into
the
river
the
moment
i
was
alone
and
the
king
said
with
a
smile
did
i
not
tell
thee
that
i
feared
lest
thou
shouldst
plunge
into
the
river
and
she
laughed
and
said
let
me
go
and
see
and
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
and
laughed
without
a
reason
and
they
embraced
each
other
passionately
and
the
king
said
give
me
now
another
kiss
so
she
did
and
he
said
now
another
and
another
and
so
they
continued
she
giving
and
he
receiving
while
the
night
passed
away
and
at
last
he
said
now
i
must
carry
my
property
away
with
me
for
thou
art
no
longer
thy
father
but
mine
and
we
will
come
again
and
tell
thy
father
but
in
the
meantime
i
will
take
thee
for
never
will
i
part
from
thee
again
and
she
said
do
with
me
as
thou
wilt
so
only
that
thou
dost
not
leave
me
then
he
said
thou
hast
seen
a
horse
for
the
first
time
and
now
thou
shalt
ride
one
also
and
she
said
with
a
smile
but
how
can
i
ride
without
falling
then
he
said
fear
nothing
dost
thou
think
that
i
would
trust
my
treasure
on
a
horse
alone
but
that
good
horse
which
brought
into
the
wood
a
single
rider
shall
carry
back
a
pair
and
he
has
run
a
race
that
will
have
robbed
him
of
his
fire
wait
now
there
for
a
little
while
till
i
return
and
beware
that
thou
dost
not
jump
into
the
water
and
as
she
smiled
they
kissed
each
other
again
with
insatiable
lips
and
then
he
went
towards
the
wood
and
shouted
for
his
men
and
when
they
came
he
gave
them
orders
and
they
brought
his
horse
and
prepared
him
as
he
said
placing
for
her
reception
soft
rugs
upon
his
back
and
the
king
mounted
and
he
said
watch
me
when
i
go
and
follow
me
at
a
distance
and
then
he
rode
back
to
where
she
waited
for
him
by
the
river
bank
then
he
came
close
up
to
her
and
said
give
me
now
thy
left
hand
and
place
thy
little
foot
on
mine
and
i
will
lift
thee
up
before
me
so
she
stretched
out
to
him
her
hand
shrinking
from
the
horse
as
it
tossed
its
head
and
trampled
the
ground
and
seeking
with
timidity
for
an
opportunity
to
place
her
foot
upon
his
own
so
as
she
waited
gazing
at
the
horse
with
doubtful
eyes
the
king
laughed
and
he
exclaimed
this
way
will
not
do
and
now
i
must
make
another
and
suddenly
he
turned
the
horse
towards
her
with
his
knee
and
letting
fall
the
reins
he
leaned
from
the
saddle
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
lifted
her
up
before
him
and
at
that
moment
the
horse
started
off
and
the
king
felt
for
the
reins
with
his
left
hand
holding
her
in
his
right
arm
while
she
clung
to
his
neck
for
fear
of
falling
and
for
a
while
the
king
let
the
horse
go
for
the
sweetness
of
her
terrified
embrace
was
such
that
he
said
to
himself
ah
could
this
only
last
for
ever
then
after
a
while
he
checked
the
horse
and
brought
him
to
a
walk
and
as
they
went
slowly
through
the
forest
now
in
the
shadow
and
now
in
the
moonlit
glades
he
let
the
reins
fall
on
his
horse
neck
and
took
his
wife
in
both
his
arms
kissing
her
lips
that
kissed
him
again
and
murmuring
inarticulately
words
without
a
meaning
and
filling
his
soul
to
the
very
brim
with
the
intoxication
of
her
shadowy
eyes
and
the
perfume
of
her
hair
that
hung
about
her
escaping
from
its
knot
and
suddenly
there
came
as
it
were
night
over
his
eyes
and
he
felt
her
slipping
from
his
embrace
which
closed
in
vain
on
empty
air
and
before
him
her
face
wavered
and
flickered
and
it
lit
up
like
a
dying
lamp
for
a
single
instant
with
vivid
brightness
and
then
went
out
and
disappeared
ix
echoes
and
regrets
and
in
an
instant
he
saw
before
him
no
wood
and
no
horse
but
he
found
himself
floating
as
at
first
like
a
cloud
in
the
blue
sky
with
his
wife
still
in
his
arms
and
he
said
ha
how
is
this
i
lost
thee
but
now
in
the
forest
and
here
we
are
together
in
the
sky
but
i
seem
to
have
but
just
awoken
from
a
dream
and
wert
thou
then
with
me
in
my
dream
then
she
said
yes
and
as
she
spoke
she
caught
him
in
a
convulsive
grasp
for
she
knew
that
the
end
was
come
and
as
she
gazed
at
him
with
agony
in
her
eyes
he
said
ah
dost
thou
remember
how
we
rode
together
and
lingered
as
i
brought
thee
home
in
that
delicious
wood
dost
thou
remember
how
we
laughed
and
how
we
wept
for
joy
dost
thou
remember
how
at
last
thou
didst
fall
asleep
from
sheer
fatigue
and
i
carried
thee
sleeping
home
dost
thou
remember
how
i
sat
and
watched
thee
in
thy
sleep
and
how
at
thine
awakening
thou
wast
frightened
forgetting
where
thou
wert
dost
thou
remember
how
everything
was
new
to
thee
and
strange
and
how
all
day
long
i
laughed
for
joy
to
see
thee
my
plaything
and
my
pretty
child
dost
thou
remember
how
we
played
at
king
and
queen
counting
the
whole
world
as
a
straw
and
never
parting
night
or
day
dost
thou
remember
how
thou
wast
by
day
the
sun
and
by
night
the
moon
of
all
the
hours
lighting
up
my
gloomy
palace
with
the
blaze
of
thy
beauty
and
the
soft
light
of
thy
love
dost
thou
remember
how
thy
voice
echoed
in
my
empty
halls
and
thy
laughter
filled
up
all
its
corners
with
music
and
delight
dost
thou
remember
how
i
used
to
follow
thee
about
from
room
to
room
and
how
sometimes
rogue
thou
wouldst
hide
from
me
to
drive
me
to
despair
dost
thou
remember
that
last
night
when
i
parted
from
thee
to
go
to
war
leaving
my
soul
behind
but
ah
alas
for
the
day
when
i
rode
like
a
whirlwind
into
the
court
and
they
told
me
of
thy
death
and
as
he
spoke
there
shot
through
his
heart
a
mortal
pang
like
a
sharp
sword
and
at
that
instant
his
wife
vanished
and
he
felt
himself
falling
falling
like
a
heavy
stone
down
through
empty
space
and
he
uttered
a
fearful
cry
for
he
understood
that
he
was
returning
swiftly
back
to
earth
and
struggling
with
vain
and
frenzied
grief
and
rage
he
screamed
aloud
in
the
ecstasy
of
despair
ah
my
wife
my
wife
ah
not
to
earth
ah
not
again
not
without
thee
not
without
thee
epilogue
the
break
of
a
heart
epilogue
but
in
the
meanwhile
the
king
attendants
sat
on
in
the
palace
hall
waiting
while
the
king
slept
and
he
slept
on
while
they
waited
and
they
watched
him
lying
very
still
on
his
couch
upon
the
floor
so
as
they
watched
and
waited
the
day
slowly
passed
away
and
hour
succeeded
hour
as
the
sun
moved
steadily
on
to
his
home
behind
the
western
hill
and
all
the
while
the
old
merchant
remained
motionless
in
his
place
stiller
even
than
the
sleeping
king
for
he
never
even
breathed
so
they
watched
and
waited
on
till
for
very
weakness
their
souls
were
almost
parting
from
their
bodies
and
slumber
began
to
steal
over
their
eyes
and
day
began
to
turn
to
twilight
and
the
darkness
began
as
it
were
to
gather
and
creep
out
of
the
corners
of
the
room
in
which
was
heard
no
sound
save
the
deep
breathing
of
the
sleeping
king
and
suddenly
like
a
flash
of
lightning
there
rang
through
that
silent
room
a
cry
that
pierced
those
weary
watchers
ears
like
the
point
of
a
molten
spear
for
it
resembled
the
cry
of
a
woman
forced
by
the
agony
of
abject
fear
into
the
very
mouth
of
death
and
as
they
bounded
to
their
feet
and
looked
towards
the
king
there
burst
from
his
heart
another
cry
and
yet
another
and
they
saw
his
body
like
a
worm
writhing
and
quivering
as
it
lay
and
all
at
once
he
leaped
from
the
couch
and
stood
erect
and
staggered
across
the
floor
and
he
stood
there
swaying
like
a
reed
and
gazing
straight
before
him
seeing
nothing
with
open
eyes
that
were
dazed
with
the
depth
of
their
own
despair
and
every
limb
of
his
body
shook
and
drops
of
sweat
stood
on
his
brow
and
his
breath
came
hard
and
fast
and
hoarse
from
a
chest
that
heaved
and
trembled
like
the
bosom
of
a
frightened
girl
so
he
stood
while
they
all
watched
him
silent
and
aghast
and
listening
as
it
were
to
the
beating
of
their
own
hearts
so
as
they
watched
him
holding
their
breath
he
began
to
wail
like
a
child
and
he
wept
aloud
with
great
sobs
that
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
till
the
tears
rose
and
stood
in
the
eyes
of
all
that
saw
him
as
if
drawn
from
their
sources
by
the
sight
of
his
own
which
fell
on
the
ground
like
rain
and
all
at
once
he
stopped
short
and
he
looked
up
and
stared
before
him
with
weeping
and
imploring
eyes
that
hunted
as
it
were
among
them
for
something
they
could
not
find
and
as
they
watched
him
silently
spellbound
by
those
troubled
eyes
they
saw
their
expression
alter
and
over
them
pass
a
dreadful
change
till
like
a
fire
they
shone
with
scorn
and
hatred
and
disdain
and
he
stepped
forward
and
spat
at
them
all
as
they
stood
before
him
stretching
out
both
his
arms
and
as
he
did
so
his
gaze
was
as
it
were
caught
by
the
glitter
of
the
glancing
gems
that
hung
upon
his
wrists
and
he
looked
at
them
for
a
moment
and
suddenly
he
took
those
jewels
and
tore
them
from
his
hands
and
arms
and
from
his
neck
and
breast
and
he
broke
them
all
to
pieces
snapping
asunder
cords
and
chains
and
tossed
all
over
the
palace
hall
pearls
and
rubies
and
all
the
rest
till
they
rattled
on
the
floor
like
hail
and
when
he
had
no
more
jewels
to
tear
he
fell
upon
his
clothes
and
he
stripped
them
off
him
with
giant
strength
and
rent
them
into
bits
and
shreds
till
he
stood
before
them
breathing
hard
dripping
with
sweat
and
bleeding
as
naked
as
he
was
born
and
as
his
eyes
ran
over
them
all
as
they
shrank
before
him
they
fell
suddenly
upon
the
old
merchant
who
sat
still
in
the
place
never
having
stirred
so
when
the
king
saw
him
suddenly
he
began
to
laugh
with
laughter
that
was
divided
from
sobbing
by
only
a
single
hair
and
he
exclaimed
ha
old
vendor
art
thou
there
waiting
for
thy
price
for
now
my
dream
is
over
and
it
only
remains
to
pay
take
for
thy
dream
my
whole
kingdom
and
all
that
it
contains
and
even
so
thou
art
unpaid
for
such
a
dream
could
not
be
ransomed
even
by
the
three
great
worlds
and
then
with
anguish
in
his
eyes
he
threw
his
arms
to
heaven
and
he
uttered
a
long
low
cry
like
the
howl
of
a
dog
whose
lord
is
dead
and
turned
and
ran
out
of
the
hall
and
they
stood
like
pictures
on
a
wall
while
the
sound
of
his
disappearing
steps
died
away
upon
their
ears
and
then
in
an
instant
the
hall
was
filled
with
tumult
but
the
king
physician
rushed
forward
and
he
exclaimed
the
king
frenzy
has
come
again
and
much
i
fear
that
it
will
never
again
depart
but
as
for
this
old
merchant
who
has
given
the
king
a
deadly
drug
let
him
not
escape
seize
him
and
let
him
answer
for
the
madness
of
the
king
then
the
guards
surrounded
that
old
merchant
but
he
never
moved
or
stirred
and
suddenly
seized
with
anger
the
captain
of
the
guards
stooped
down
and
seized
him
by
the
beard
to
drag
him
roughly
to
his
feet
and
lo
that
old
man
head
came
off
his
neck
and
hung
by
the
beard
in
his
hand
and
they
looked
and
saw
that
the
body
was
hollow
and
empty
and
without
a
soul
like
the
trunk
of
a
withered
tree
then
they
gazed
at
one
another
with
open
mouths
and
eyes
that
were
dull
with
fear
and
after
a
while
the
chaplain
spoke
and
he
said
slowly
surely
this
was
an
old
rákshasa
playing
with
the
king
life
or
who
knows
for
it
may
be
the
deity
took
this
form
to
punish
the
king
by
means
of
a
dream
for
the
sins
of
a
former
birth

more
generally
known
perhaps
than
any
other
hindoo
legend
is
the
story
of
the
demon
ráhu
who
brings
about
eclipses
by
devouring
the
sun
and
moon
for
when
the
gods
had
upchurned
the
nectar
the
delectable
butter
of
the
brine
ráhu
mouth
watered
at
the
very
sight
of
it
and
in
the
guise
of
a
god
he
mingled
unperceived
among
them
to
partake
but
the
sun
and
moon
the
watchful
eyes
of
night
and
day
detected
him
and
told
wishnu
who
cast
at
him
his
discus
and
cut
his
body
from
his
head
but
not
until
the
nectar
was
on
the
way
down
his
throat
hence
though
the
body
died
the
head
became
immortal
and
ever
since
a
thing
unique
no
body
and
all
head
a
byword
among
philosophers
he
takes
revenge
on
sun
and
moon
the
great
taletellers
by
gripping
them
in
his
horrid
jaws
and
holding
on
till
he
is
tired
or
can
be
persuaded
to
let
go
hence
in
some
parts
of
india
the
doleful
shout
of
the
country
people
at
eclipses
do
chor
do
and
hence
also
the
primary
and
surface
meaning
of
our
title
digit
of
the
moon
in
the
demon
in
plain
english
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
and
yet
legend
though
it
be
there
is
something
in
the
old
mythological
way
of
putting
the
case
which
describes
the
situation
in
eclipses
far
better
than
our
arid
scientific
prose
i
shall
not
easily
forget
how
as
we
slid
like
ghosts
at
midnight
through
the
middle
of
the
desert
along
the
suez
canal
i
watched
the
ghastly
pallor
of
the
wan
unhappy
moon
as
the
horrible
shadow
crept
slowly
over
her
face
stealing
away
her
beauty
and
turning
the
lone
and
level
sands
that
stretched
away
below
to
a
weird
and
ashy
blue
as
though
covering
the
earth
with
a
sepulchral
sympathetic
pall
for
we
caught
the
griesly
terror
ráhu
at
his
horrid
work
towards
the
end
of
may
four
years
ago
but
our
title
has
yet
another
meaning
underneath
the
first
for
the
name
employed
for
ráhu
like
all
other
figures
in
indian
mythology
he
is
known
by
many
names
also
means
a
persecuted
by
a
is
the
subject
of
the
story
that
story
will
presently
explain
itself
but
the
relation
between
or
eclipses
and
a
snake
is
so
curiously
illustrated
by
a
little
insignificant
occurrence
that
happened
to
myself
that
the
reader
will
doubtless
forgive
me
for
making
him
acquainted
with
it
being
at
delhi
not
many
years
ago
i
seized
the
opportunity
to
visit
the
kutub
minár
there
was
famine
in
the
land
at
every
station
i
had
passed
upon
the
way
were
piled
the
hides
of
bullocks
and
from
the
train
you
might
see
their
skeletons
lying
each
one
bleaching
where
it
died
for
want
of
fodder
scattered
here
and
there
on
the
brown
and
burning
earth
for
even
every
river
bed
was
waterless
and
not
a
single
blade
of
green
could
you
descry
for
many
hundred
miles
and
hence
it
came
about
that
as
i
gazed
upon
the
two
emaciated
hacks
that
were
to
pull
me
from
the
station
a
dozen
miles
out
and
as
many
more
back
i
could
bring
myself
to
sit
behind
them
only
by
the
thought
that
thereby
i
should
save
them
from
a
load
far
greater
than
my
own
that
would
have
been
their
fate
on
my
refusal
therefore
we
started
and
did
ultimately
arrive
in
the
very
blaze
of
noon
the
kutub
minár
is
a
needle
of
red
stone
that
rises
from
a
plain
as
flat
as
paper
to
a
height
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
and
you
might
compare
it
as
you
catch
approaching
glimpses
of
it
at
a
distance
to
a
colossal
chimney
a
pharos
or
an
efreet
of
the
jinn
the
last
would
be
the
best
for
nothing
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
can
parallel
the
scene
of
desolation
which
unrolls
itself
below
if
you
climb
its
steps
and
look
out
from
the
dizzy
verge
a
thing
that
will
test
both
the
muscle
of
your
knees
and
the
steadiness
of
your
nerves
round
you
is
empty
space
look
down
the
pillar
bends
and
totters
and
you
seem
to
rock
in
air
you
shudder
you
are
falling
and
away
away
below
far
as
the
eye
can
carry
you
see
the
dusty
plain
studded
with
a
thousand
tombs
and
relics
of
forgotten
kings
there
is
the
grim
old
fortress
of
the
toghlaks
there
is
the
singular
observatory
of
the
rájá
astronomer
jaya
singh
and
there
the
tomb
humaioon
tomb
before
which
hodson
hodson
the
brave
hodson
the
slandered
hodson
the
unforgotten
sat
for
two
long
hours
still
as
if
man
and
horse
were
carved
in
stone
with
the
hostile
crowd
that
loathed
and
feared
him
tossing
and
seething
and
surging
round
him
waiting
for
the
last
mogul
to
come
out
and
be
led
away
the
air
is
thick
and
sparkles
with
blinding
dust
and
glare
and
the
wind
whistles
in
your
ears
over
the
bones
of
dynasties
the
hot
wind
wails
and
sobs
and
moans
aye
if
a
man
seeks
for
melancholy
i
will
tell
him
where
to
find
it
at
the
top
of
the
old
kutub
minár
and
then
that
happened
which
i
had
foreseen
we
had
not
gone
a
mile
upon
our
homeward
way
when
one
of
the
horses
fell
therefore
disregarding
the
asseverations
of
my
rascally
jehu
that
the
remaining
animal
was
fully
equal
to
the
task
alone
i
descended
and
proceeded
on
foot
but
a
walk
on
the
delhi
plain
in
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
is
not
a
thing
to
be
recommended
after
plodding
on
for
about
two
hours
i
was
like
langland
wery
forwandred
and
went
me
to
rest
not
alas
by
a
burnside
but
in
the
shadow
of
one
of
the
innumerable
little
tombs
that
stand
along
the
dusty
road
there
i
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
nothing
induces
slumber
like
exertion
under
an
indian
sun
when
i
awoke
that
sun
was
setting
a
little
way
before
me
the
yellow
walls
of
delhi
were
bathed
in
a
ruddy
glow
the
minarets
of
the
great
mosque
stood
out
sharp
against
the
clear
unspotted
amber
sky
and
as
i
watched
them
i
suddenly
became
aware
that
i
was
myself
observed
with
interest
by
a
dusky
individual
who
was
squatted
just
in
front
of
me
and
who
rose
salaaming
when
he
saw
that
i
was
awake
it
appeared
that
i
had
so
to
say
fallen
into
a
nest
of
vipers
that
i
had
unwittingly
invaded
the
premises
of
a
snake
dealer
who
no
doubt
for
solid
reasons
had
made
my
friendly
tomb
the
temporary
repository
of
his
the
indian
snake
charmer
or
whatever
else
they
call
him
is
as
a
rule
but
a
poor
impostor
he
goes
about
with
one
fangless
cobra
one
rock
snake
and
one
miserable
mongoose
strangling
at
the
end
of
a
string
my
dweller
in
tombs
was
richer
than
all
his
tribe
in
his
snakes
and
in
his
eyes
i
have
never
seen
anybody
else
with
real
cat
eyes
eyes
with
exactly
that
greenish
yellow
luminous
glare
which
you
see
when
you
look
at
a
cat
in
the
dark
they
gleamed
and
rolled
in
the
evening
sun
over
a
row
of
shining
teeth
as
their
owner
squatted
down
before
me
liberating
one
after
another
from
little
bags
and
baskets
an
amazing
multitude
of
snakes
which
he
fetched
in
batches
from
the
interior
of
the
tomb
till
the
very
ground
seemed
alive
with
them
some
of
them
he
handled
only
with
the
greatest
respect
and
by
means
of
an
iron
prong
outside
the
zoo
where
they
lose
in
effect
i
never
saw
so
many
together
before
and
it
is
only
when
you
see
a
number
of
these
reptiles
together
that
you
realise
what
a
strange
uncanny
being
after
all
is
a
snake
and
as
you
watch
him
lying
as
it
were
in
wait
beautiful
exceedingly
but
with
a
beauty
that
inspires
you
with
a
shudder
his
eyes
full
of
cruelty
and
original
sin
and
his
tongue
of
calumny
and
malice
you
begin
to
understand
his
influence
in
all
religions
i
was
wholly
absorbed
in
their
snaky
evolutions
and
buried
in
mythological
reminiscences
when
my
roused
me
suddenly
by
saying
look
he
leaned
over
and
administered
with
his
bare
hand
a
vicious
dig
to
a
magnificent
hamadryad
that
lay
coiled
upon
itself
in
its
open
basket
the
creature
instantly
sat
up
with
a
surge
of
splendid
passion
hissing
bowing
and
expanding
angrily
its
great
tawny
hood
the
put
his
to
his
lips
and
blew
for
a
while
upon
it
a
low
and
wheezy
drone
the
invariable
prelude
to
a
little
or
black
art
which
the
beautiful
animal
appeared
to
appreciate
and
then
pointing
with
the
end
of
his
pipe
to
the
spectacles
on
its
hood
he
said
with
that
silky
insinuating
smile
which
is
characteristic
of
the
scamp
dekko

i
did
not
understand
his
lunar
allusion
but
judging
that
his
rhyming
gibberish
like
that
of
the
rascally
priests
in
apuleius
was
a
carefully
prepared
oracle
of
general
application
kept
in
stock
for
the
cozening
of
such
prey
as
myself
i
repeated
to
him
my
favourite
hindu
proverb
and
gave
him
in
exchange
for
his
benevolent
cheque
on
the
future
a
more
commonplace
article
of
present
value
which
led
to
our
parting
on
the
most
amicable
terms
but
i
did
him
injustice
perhaps
long
afterwards
having
occasion
to
consult
an
astronomical
chart
with
reference
to
this
very
story
all
at
once
i
started
and
in
an
instant
the
golden
evening
the
walls
of
delhi
and
my
friend
of
the
many
snakes
and
sinister
eyes
suddenly
rose
up
again
into
my
mind
for
there
staring
at
me
out
of
the
chart
was
the
mark
on
the
head
it
is
the
sign
still
used
in
modern
astronomy
for
the
head
and
tail
of
the
dragon
the
nodes
indicating
the
point
of
occultation
the
symbol
of
eclipse
what
then
induced
or
inspired
the
to
connect
me
with
the
moon
was
it
really
black
art
divination
or
was
it
only
a
coincidence
reason
recommends
the
latter
alternative
and
yet
the
contrary
persuasion
is
not
without
its
charm
who
knows
it
may
be
that
the
soul
grows
to
its
atmosphere
as
well
as
the
body
and
living
in
a
land
where
dreams
are
realities
and
all
things
are
credible
and
history
is
only
a
fairy
tale
the

and

reason
to
believe
that
this
man
must
have
been
one
of
the
disciples
of
a
former
very
celebrated
snake
charmer
who
was
known
all
over
india
he
makes
which
we
may
roughly
render
of
snake
brings
joy
and
rue
this

moon
and
that
to
in
all
oriental
saws
jingle
counts
for
much
in
this
world
hobnob
with
everybody
for
you
never
know
in
what
guise
the
deity
may
present
in
the
original
it
is
a
rhyming
stanza
contents
i
a
haunted
beauty
ii
a
total
eclipse
iii
a
fatal
kiss
a
haunted
beauty
a
haunted
beauty
that
triumphant
lord
protect
us
who
as
he
stands
in
mysterious
meditation
bathed
in
twilight
motionless
and
ashy
pale
with
the
crystal
moon
in
his
yellow
hair
appears
to
the
host
of
worshippers
on
his
left
a
woman
and
to
those
on
his
right
a
i
there
lived
of
old
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
a
rájá
of
the
race
of
the
sun
and
like
that
sun
reflected
at
midday
in
the
glassy
depths
of
the
mánasa
lake
he
had
an
image
of
himself
in
the
form
of
a
son
who
exactly
resembled
him
in
every
particular
except
age
and
he
gave
him
the
name
of
aja
for
he
said
he
is
not
another
but
my
very
self
that
has
conquered
death
and
passed
without
birth
straight
over
into
another
body
moreover
he
will
resemble
his
ancestor
and
the
god
after
whom
i
have
called
him
aja
so
as
this
son
grew
up
his
father
delight
in
him
grew
greater
also
for
he
was
tall
as
a
tree
and
very
strong
and
yet
like
another
god
of
love
for
his
face
was
more
beautiful
than
the
face
of
any
woman
with
large
eyes
like
and
lips
like
laughter
incarnate
so
that
his
father
as
often
as
he
looked
at
him
said
to
himself
surely
the
creator
has
made
a
mistake
and
mixed
up
his
male
and
female
ingredients
and
made
him
half
and
half
for
if
only
he
had
had
a
twin
sister
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
tell
with
certainty
which
was
which
and
then
when
aja
was
eighteen
his
father
died
and
immediately
his
relations
conspired
against
him
led
by
his
maternal
uncle
and
they
laid
a
plot
and
seized
him
at
night
and
bound
him
when
he
was
asleep
for
they
dared
not
attack
him
when
he
was
awake
for
fear
of
his
courage
and
his
prodigious
strength
and
they
deliberated
over
him
as
he
lay
bound
what
they
should
do
with
him
and
some
of
them
were
for
putting
him
to
death
then
and
there
but
the
prime
minister
who
was
in
the
plot
persuaded
them
to
let
him
live
saying
to
himself
in
this
way
i
shall
make
for
myself
a
loophole
of
escape
in
case
he
should
ever
regain
his
throne
then
in
the
early
morning
his
uncle
and
his
other
relations
took
him
away
and
laid
him
bound
on
a
swift
camel
and
mounting
others
they
hurried
him
away
into
the
desert
going
at
full
speed
for
hours
till
they
reached
its
very
heart
and
there
they
set
him
down
and
they
placed
beside
him
a
little
water
in
a
small
skin
and
a
little
bag
of
corn
and
his
uncle
said
now
o
nephew
we
will
leave
thee
alone
with
thy
shadow
and
thy
life
in
the
sand
and
if
thou
canst
save
thyself
by
going
away
to
the
western
quarter
lo
it
is
open
before
thee
but
beware
of
attempting
to
return
home
towards
the
rising
sun
for
i
will
set
guards
to
watch
thy
coming
and
i
will
not
spare
thee
a
second
time
and
then
he
set
his
left
arm
free
and
laid
beside
him
a
little
knife
and
they
mounted
their
camels
and
taking
his
they
flew
away
from
him
over
the
sand
like
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
driven
by
the
western
wind
so
when
they
were
gone
aja
took
the
knife
and
cut
his
bonds
and
he
stood
up
and
watched
them
going
till
they
became
specks
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
and
vanished
out
of
his
sight
being
actually
smeared
with
ashes
the
god
is
of
course
shiwa
and
the
allusion
is
to
his
or
half
male
half
female
form
this
punning
assonance
is
precisely
in
the
vein
of
the
original
ii
then
he
looked
round
to
the
eight
quarters
of
the
world
and
he
looked
up
into
the
sky
and
he
said
to
himself
there
is
my
ancestor
alone
above
and
i
am
alone
below
and
he
put
his
two
hands
to
his
breast
and
flung
them
out
into
the
air
and
he
exclaimed
ye
guardians
of
the
world
ye
are
my
witnesses
thus
do
i
fling
away
the
past
and
now
the
whole
wide
world
is
mine
and
ye
are
my
protectors
and
i
have
escaped
death
by
a
miracle
and
the
craft
of
that
old
villain
of
a
prime
minister
whom
i
will
one
day
punish
as
he
deserves
and
now
it
is
as
though
i
knew
for
the
very
first
time
in
all
my
life
what
it
was
to
be
alive
ha
i
live
and
breathe
and
there
before
me
is
food
and
water
and
now
we
will
see
which
is
the
stronger
death
in
the
form
of
this
lonely
desert
or
the
life
that
laughs
at
his
menace
as
it
dances
in
my
veins
and
little
i
care
for
the
loss
of
my
kingdom
now
that
my
father
is
dead
and
gone
i
throw
it
away
like
a
blade
of
grass
and
so
far
from
lamenting
i
feel
rather
as
if
i
had
been
born
again
ha
it
is
good
to
be
alive
even
in
this
waste
of
sand
and
he
shouted
aloud
and
called
out
to
the
sun
above
him
come
old
grandfather
thou
and
i
will
travel
together
across
the
sand
and
yet
no
thou
art
too
rapid
and
too
fierce
to
be
a
safe
companion
even
for
one
of
thine
own
race
so
thou
shalt
go
before
me
as
is
due
to
thee
and
i
will
follow
after
and
then
he
lay
down
on
the
sand
covering
his
head
with
his
upper
garment
and
slept
and
waited
all
day
long
till
the
sun
was
going
down
and
then
he
rose
and
ate
and
drank
a
very
little
and
taking
with
him
his
skin
and
corn
he
walked
on
after
the
sun
which
sank
to
his
rest
in
the
western
mountain
but
aja
followed
him
all
night
long
with
the
moon
for
his
only
companion
and
as
he
went
he
saw
the
bones
of
men
and
camels
lying
along
the
sand
and
grinning
at
him
as
it
were
with
white
and
silent
laughter
as
though
to
say
anticipate
thy
fate
for
but
a
little
further
on
and
thou
shalt
be
what
we
are
now
but
he
went
on
with
nimble
feet
like
one
that
hurries
through
the
den
of
a
sleeping
hungry
lion
till
the
sun
rose
at
last
behind
him
and
then
again
he
lay
down
and
rested
all
day
long
and
started
again
at
night
and
so
he
proceeded
for
many
days
till
all
his
water
and
corn
were
gone
and
as
he
threw
away
the
skin
he
set
his
teeth
and
said
no
matter
i
will
reach
the
end
of
this
hideous
sand
which
like
the
dress
of
draupadi
seems
to
roll
itself
out
as
i
go
across
it
though
i
should
have
to
go
walking
on
long
after
i
am
dead
and
night
after
night
he
went
on
growing
every
night
a
little
weaker
and
then
at
last
there
came
a
night
when
as
he
toiled
along
with
heavy
steps
that
flagged
as
it
were
with
loaded
feet
faint
with
hunger
and
burning
thirst
he
said
to
himself
i
am
nearly
spent
and
now
the
end
is
coming
near
either
of
the
sand
or
of
me
and
then
the
sun
rose
behind
him
and
he
looked
up
and
lo
it
was
reflected
from
the
wall
of
a
city
before
him
which
resembled
another
sun
of
hope
rising
in
the
west
to
cheer
him
and
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
again
saying
to
himself
is
it
a
delusion
of
the
desert
to
mock
me
as
i
perish
or
is
it
really
a
true
city
and
he
said
again
ha
it
is
a
real
city
and
his
ebbing
strength
came
back
to
him
with
a
flood
of
joy
and
he
stopped
and
took
up
a
little
sand
and
turned
and
threw
it
back
exclaiming
out
upon
thee
abode
of
death
now
then
i
have
beaten
thee
and
thy
victim
will
after
all
escape
and
he
hurried
on
towards
the
city
half
afraid
to
take
his
eyes
away
from
it
for
a
single
instant
lest
it
should
disappear
so
as
he
drew
near
it
he
saw
a
crowd
upon
its
wall
and
when
he
was
distant
from
it
but
a
little
way
suddenly
its
great
gate
mouth
was
thrown
open
and
a
stream
of
people
shot
from
it
like
a
long
tongue
and
rapidly
came
towards
him
so
that
he
said
to
himself
ha
then
as
it
seems
i
am
expected
by
the
citizens
of
this
delightful
city
who
are
as
eager
to
come
to
me
as
i
am
to
get
to
them
and
they
came
closer
clamouring
and
buzzing
as
it
were
like
bees
and
he
looked
and
lo
they
were
all
women
and
there
was
not
a
man
among
them
all
and
as
he
wondered
they
ran
up
and
reached
him
and
threw
themselves
upon
him
like
a
wave
of
the
sea
laughing
and
crying
and
drowning
him
in
their
embraces
and
they
took
him
as
it
were
captive
and
swept
him
away
towards
the
city
all
talking
at
once
and
deafening
him
with
their
joyful
exclamations
paying
not
the
least
attention
to
anything
that
he
tried
to
say
and
aja
let
himself
go
carried
away
by
all
those
women
like
a
leaf
in
a
rushing
stream
and
he
said
to
himself
in
astonishment
what
is
this
great
wonder
for
all
these
women
fight
for
me
as
if
they
had
never
seen
a
man
in
their
lives
before
where
then
can
the
men
be
to
whom
they
must
belong
or
can
it
be
that
i
have
come
to
a
city
composed
of
women
without
a
man
have
i
escaped
the
desert
only
to
be
drowned
in
a
sea
of
women
for
what
is
the
use
of
a
single
man
in
an
ocean
of
the
other
sex
or
are
they
dragging
me
away
to
offer
me
up
to
the
mother
having
sacrificed
all
their
own
husbands
already
or
have
i
really
died
in
the
desert
and
is
all
this
only
a
dream
of
the
other
world
can
these
be
the
heavenly
apsarases
come
in
a
body
to
fetch
me
away
as
if
i
had
fallen
in
battle
surely
they
are
for
some
of
them
are
sufficiently
beautiful
even
for
hall
and
anyhow
it
is
better
to
be
torn
to
pieces
by
beautiful
women
even
if
there
are
far
too
many
than
to
die
in
the
desert
all
alone
so
as
they
bore
him
along
chattering
on
like
jays
and
cranes
he
said
again
to
the
women
next
him
fair
ones
who
are
you
and
where
are
you
taking
me
and
why
in
the
world
are
you
so
greatly
delighted
to
see
me
and
then
at
last
they
replied
o
handsome
stranger
ask
nothing
very
soon
thou
shalt
know
all
for
we
are
carrying
thee
away
to
our
king
and
aja
said
to
himself
ha
so
then
there
is
a
king
these
women
have
after
all
a
king
truly
i
am
fain
to
see
him
this
singular
king
of
a
female
city
and
weak
as
he
was
he
began
to
laugh
as
they
all
were
laughing
and
so
they
all
surged
on
like
a
very
sea
of
laughter
through
the
gates
of
the
city
and
along
the
streets
within
till
they
came
at
last
to
the
king
palace
and
all
the
way
aja
looked
and
there
was
not
to
be
seen
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
a
man
in
all
the
streets
which
overflowed
with
women
like
the
channel
of
a
river
in
the
rainy
season
then
the
guards
of
the
palace
doors
who
were
also
women
took
him
and
led
him
in
and
all
the
women
who
had
brought
him
crowded
in
behind
and
they
mounted
stairs
and
after
a
while
they
entered
at
last
a
great
hall
whose
pillars
of
alabaster
were
reflected
in
its
dark
green
crystal
floor
giving
it
the
semblance
of
a
silent
pool
in
which
a
multitude
of
colossal
swans
had
buried
their
necks
beneath
the
water
and
there
aja
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
king
and
instantly
all
the
women
screamed
together
victory
to
thee
maharájá
for
here
have
we
brought
thee
another
husband
for
thy
lovely
daughter
and
aja
started
and
he
said
to
himself
another
husband
how
many
husbands
then
has
this
strange
king
daughter
got
already
has
she
an
insatiable
thirst
for
husbands
whose
number
i
am
brought
to
swell
so
as
he
stood
reflecting
the
king
leaped
from
his
throne
and
came
towards
him
and
as
aja
looked
at
him
he
was
seized
with
amazement
greater
than
before
for
the
king
resembled
a
very
incarnation
of
the
essence
of
grief
yet
such
that
it
was
difficult
to
behold
him
without
laughter
as
if
the
creator
had
made
him
to
exhibit
skill
in
combining
the
two
for
his
long
thin
hair
was
pure
white
as
if
with
sorrow
and
his
eyes
were
red
as
if
with
weeping
and
great
hollow
ruts
were
furrowed
in
his
sunk
and
withered
cheeks
as
if
the
tears
had
worn
themselves
channels
in
which
to
run
and
though
he
was
tall
he
was
bent
and
old
as
if
bowed
down
by
a
load
of
care
and
he
tried
as
if
in
vain
to
smile
as
he
said
in
a
mournful
voice
that
quavered
and
cracked
o
man
whoever
thou
art
long
have
i
waited
for
thee
and
glad
indeed
i
am
to
see
thee
and
inclined
to
dance
like
a
peacock
at
the
sight
of
a
rainy
cloud
and
as
he
gazed
upon
the
king
aja
was
seized
with
sudden
laughter
that
would
not
be
controlled
saying
within
himself
much
in
common
they
have
between
them
a
dancing
happy
peacock
and
this
doleful
specimen
of
a
weeping
king
and
he
laughed
till
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
also
as
if
in
imitation
of
those
of
the
king
and
when
at
last
he
could
speak
he
said
o
king
forgive
me
for
i
am
very
weak
and
have
come
within
a
little
of
dying
in
the
desert
and
i
laughed
from
sheer
exhaustion
and
for
joy
to
see
in
thy
person
as
it
were
the
warrant
of
my
escape
from
death
give
me
food
and
above
all
water
if
thou
wouldst
not
have
me
die
at
thy
feet
and
afterwards
show
me
if
thou
wilt
thy
daughter
to
whom
as
it
seems
i
am
to
be
married
whether
i
will
or
no
and
the
king
said
o
thou
model
of
the
creator
cunning
in
the
making
of
man
thy
hilarity
is
excused
food
thou
shalt
have
and
water
and
everything
else
thou
canst
require
and
that
immediately
but
as
for
my
daughter
there
she
is
before
thee
and
she
could
teach
dancing
even
to
tumburu
himself
the
or
regents
of
the
world
often
thus
appealed
to
are
eight
kubera
isha
indra
agni
yama
niruti
waruna
and
wayu
and
they
ride
on
a
horse
a
bull
an
elephant
a
ram
a
buffalo
a
man
a
crocodile
and
a
stag
when
she
was
lost
in
the
gambling
match
and
duhshásana
tried
to
strip
her
as
he
pulled
off
one
dress
another
appeared
below
it
refusing
to
leave
her
naked
still
the
name
of
marwar
durgá
or
párwatí
a
ghandarwa
or
heavenly
musician
and
the
dancing
master
of
the
apsarases
pronounce
to
rhyme
with
rather
short
iii
and
then
as
the
laughter
surged
again
in
aja
soul
saying
within
himself
out
on
this
pitiable
old
scarecrow
of
a
king
whose
only
thought
is
dancing
the
king
turned
and
stood
aside
and
aja
looked
and
instantly
the
laughter
died
out
of
his
heart
which
ceased
as
it
were
to
beat
and
he
murmured
to
himself
ha
this
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
of
all
king
and
women
and
desert
and
all
vanished
out
of
his
mind
as
if
the
sentiment
that
suddenly
seized
it
filled
it
so
completely
as
to
leave
room
for
nothing
else
and
he
stood
still
gazing
feeling
as
though
he
were
spinning
round
though
he
was
standing
still
as
death
for
there
before
him
stood
this
enigmatical
king
daughter
and
like
her
father
she
also
seemed
an
incarnation
of
the
soul
of
grief
not
as
in
his
case
ignominious
and
an
object
of
derision
but
rather
resembling
a
heavenly
drug
compounded
of
the
camphor
of
the
cold
and
midnight
moon
that
had
put
on
a
fragrant
form
of
feminine
and
fairy
beauty
to
drive
the
world
to
sheer
distraction
half
with
love
and
half
with
woe
for
like
the
silvery
vision
of
the
streak
of
that
lord
of
herbs
she
was
slender
and
pale
and
wan
formed
as
it
seemed
of
some
new
strange
essence
of
pure
clear
ice
and
new
dropt
snow
and
she
loomed
on
the
soul
of
aja
out
of
the
blackness
of
his
trance
like
a
large
white
drooping
lily
just
seen
in
the
gloom
of
an
inky
night
and
her
hair
and
brow
were
the
colour
of
a
in
the
month
of
chaitra
and
like
that
cloud
the
heavy
sorrow
hung
in
her
great
dark
mournful
eyes
drenching
him
as
it
were
with
a
shower
of
dusky
dreamy
dewy
beauty
and
drawing
him
down
bewitched
and
lost
like
the
victim
of
a
haunted
pool
into
the
snaky
eddy
of
their
silent
unfathomable
recess
and
yet
her
deep
red
lips
trembled
as
it
were
on
the
very
border
of
a
smile
as
if
they
were
hinting
against
their
will
of
a
mine
of
laughter
and
subtle
snares
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
use
and
she
had
risen
up
to
come
and
meet
him
yet
was
hanging
back
as
if
reluctant
and
so
she
stood
all
reflected
in
the
polished
floor
with
her
head
thrown
back
to
look
at
him
for
she
was
very
small
like
one
on
the
very
point
of
imploring
help
yet
shrinking
as
if
too
proud
to
ask
it
from
a
stranger
balanced
as
it
were
between
reliance
on
her
own
pure
and
pleading
beauty
and
doubtfulness
of
its
reception
so
she
halted
irresolute
with
glorious
throat
that
was
hovering
still
over
the
swell
of
her
lifted
breasts
poised
as
it
were
on
the
very
verge
of
tumultuous
oscillation
like
that
of
rati
preparing
with
timidity
to
cast
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
god
to
beg
back
the
body
of
her
husband
in
a
passion
of
tears
and
aja
stood
before
her
like
the
sea
when
the
digit
of
the
moon
rises
suddenly
over
its
waves
stirred
with
a
tumult
of
strange
emotions
and
yet
lit
by
a
heavenly
ray
a
mass
of
agitated
darkness
mixed
with
dancing
trembling
light
all
unaware
that
he
was
himself
to
the
daughter
exactly
what
she
was
to
him
a
weapon
of
bewilderment
in
the
hands
of
the
cunning
god
of
the
flowery
bow
who
shot
him
suddenly
at
her
like
an
arrow
of
intoxication
and
pierced
her
through
the
very
middle
of
the
soft
lotus
of
her
heart
so
they
two
stood
awhile
in
silence
and
all
at
once
aja
spoke
not
knowing
that
he
spoke
aloud
and
he
said
very
slowly
how
many
husbands
then
have
already
had
this
lustrous
beauty
who
looks
for
all
as
pure
and
pale
and
undefiled
as
a
new
young
delicate
jasmine
bud
and
instantly
as
if
roused
from
sleep
by
his
reproach
he
saw
the
colour
leap
up
into
her
cheek
and
spread
like
dawn
flushing
over
her
burning
throat
and
brow
and
she
drew
a
sudden
breath
and
her
bosom
heaved
abruptly
as
if
with
a
sob
of
shame
and
at
that
moment
the
voice
of
the
king
her
father
broke
harshly
into
aja
dream
saying
alas
alas
never
a
husband
has
had
her
yet
though
she
is
now
long
past
sixteen
and
could
even
teach
tumburu
dancing
and
then
as
if
the
king
words
had
suddenly
lifted
a
weight
from
his
soul
aja
burst
into
a
shout
of
laughter
and
he
tottered
as
if
to
fall
and
he
caught
at
the
old
king
arm
and
gripped
it
so
that
he
almost
screamed
exclaiming
amid
his
laughter
ha
king
i
am
also
the
son
of
a
king
and
now
i
will
be
thy
and
she
shall
have
a
husband
at
last
and
teach
him
if
she
pleases
dances
that
even
tumburu
does
not
know
and
with
that
he
fell
into
such
a
paroxysm
of
laughter
that
weak
as
he
was
he
could
not
stand
but
fell
and
his
laughing
turned
to
sobbing
then
the
king
daughter
turned
to
her
father
with
an
angry
flush
on
her
brow
and
she
said
with
strong
emotion
o
father
wilt
thou
delay
for
ever
to
send
for
food
and
water
dost
thou
not
see
that
this
king
son
great
and
powerful
though
he
be
is
weak
and
it
may
be
perishing
before
thy
face
of
hunger
and
thirst
having
escaped
by
a
miracle
out
of
the
desert
to
die
by
thy
neglect
and
she
clapped
her
hands
stamping
her
foot
in
indignation
then
the
women
ran
and
took
up
aja
and
carried
him
away
and
they
bathed
him
and
tended
him
and
fed
him
till
he
was
recovered
and
after
a
while
they
brought
him
back
into
the
presence
of
the
king
april
iv
so
he
came
once
more
into
that
hall
looking
like
another
man
and
he
seemed
in
the
eyes
of
the
king
like
the
rising
sun
of
his
marriage
but
in
those
of
his
daughter
like
the
very
god
of
love
newly
risen
from
his
own
ashes
and
he
said
joyously
o
king
now
i
am
again
myself
and
my
reason
and
my
strength
have
both
again
returned
to
me
and
if
in
their
absence
i
behaved
strangely
and
without
good
manners
it
behoves
thee
to
lay
the
blame
rather
on
the
desert
of
sand
that
surrounds
thy
city
than
on
myself
for
i
was
like
one
delirious
and
half
distracted
by
wonder
and
other
feelings
coming
to
the
aid
of
hunger
and
thirst
then
he
told
the
king
his
name
and
family
and
all
his
story
looking
all
the
while
at
the
king
daughter
as
she
did
all
the
while
at
him
with
glances
that
resembled
sighs
but
as
he
watched
her
aja
said
to
himself
in
wonder
what
has
happened
to
her
since
i
saw
her
first
and
what
is
the
matter
with
her
now
for
her
quiet
grief
has
abandoned
her
and
she
looks
like
one
in
a
burning
fever
and
two
red
spots
like
suns
burn
and
blaze
upon
her
cheeks
and
her
great
eyes
shine
and
glow
as
if
there
were
a
fire
within
her
soul
so
when
he
had
finished
his
own
tale
he
said
now
then
o
king
i
have
told
thee
all
that
i
have
to
tell
and
now
it
is
thy
turn
to
speak
explain
to
me
all
this
wonder
for
i
seem
to
move
in
a
maze
of
extraordinary
events
why
are
there
in
thy
city
no
men
but
only
women
and
what
is
the
cause
of
thy
grief
and
greatest
wonder
of
all
how
comes
it
that
thou
hast
found
a
difficulty
in
finding
a
husband
for
this
thy
daughter
for
as
for
myself
know
that
make
any
terms
thou
wilt
i
am
ready
to
marry
her
blindfold
on
any
conditions
whatever
nay
would
she
only
be
my
wife
i
should
consider
the
fruit
of
my
birth
attained
and
then
to
his
amazement
that
strange
old
king
began
to
weep
once
more
and
tears
flowed
down
his
cheeks
like
rain
as
he
said
alas
alas
o
that
would
be
so
fine
a
man
art
thou
that
i
am
distressed
indeed
to
see
thee
and
to
hear
thee
so
eagerly
proposing
to
take
my
daughter
for
thy
wife
for
all
that
have
preceded
thee
and
they
were
many
hundreds
have
said
the
very
same
and
yet
all
without
exception
have
come
to
a
miserable
end
and
there
she
is
unmarried
still
and
yet
this
is
no
fault
of
hers
unless
indeed
it
be
a
fault
to
be
beautiful
beyond
compare
nor
has
her
maiden
purity
been
sullied
in
the
least
degree
by
ever
a
suitor
of
them
all
but
all
this
has
come
about
by
reason
of
a
fault
of
mine
itself
beyond
a
doubt
the
bitter
fruit
of
the
tree
of
crimes
committed
in
a
former
birth
for
know
that
long
ago
when
i
was
young
i
conquered
the
entire
earth
and
brought
it
all
from
sea
to
sea
under
the
shadow
of
one
umbrella
so
when
i
was
reposing
after
my
exertions
one
day
there
came
to
see
me
nárada
and
another
and
nárada
entered
first
and
when
he
complimented
me
as
the
chosen
husband
of
the
earth
i
said
to
myself
now
i
must
make
him
some
suitable
return
and
accordingly
i
presented
him
with
the
whole
earth
then
he
replied
o
king
what
is
the
use
of
the
earth
to
me
and
he
gave
it
back
to
me
with
his
blessing
saying
obtain
an
incomparably
beautiful
offspring
and
so
he
went
away
and
then
the
other
great
entered
and
congratulated
me
also
and
i
presented
him
also
with
the
entire
earth
then
that
looked
at
me
with
eyes
that
were
red
with
anger
and
he
said
slowly
what
is
my
merit
utterly
despised
dost
thou
presume
to
offer
me
only
the
leavings
of
another
thou
shalt
indeed
obtain
offspring
but
only
of
the
female
sex
and
beautiful
it
shall
be
indeed
but
little
shall
that
beauty
profit
either
thyself
or
her
so
having
uttered
his
curse
he
laughed
and
instantly
went
away
refusing
to
be
propitiated
or
to
throw
any
light
upon
the
future
and
thereafter
in
due
time
there
was
born
to
me
not
the
nectar
of
a
son
but
this
lump
of
grief
in
the
form
of
a
daughter
and
as
if
her
sex
were
not
enough
her
almost
inconceivable
beauty
and
accomplishments
have
only
added
to
my
calamity
nay
they
are
the
very
root
of
it
and
the
essence
of
its
sting
for
all
has
come
to
pass
exactly
as
that
testy
old
said
for
though
she
is
as
thou
seest
beautiful
as
the
moon
and
like
it
full
of
arts
and
above
all
a
dancer
that
would
turn
even
tumburu
green
with
envy
all
this
nectar
has
become
poison
by
the
curse
of
that
old
ascetic
and
the
very
perfection
of
her
beauty
has
become
the
means
of
undoing
us
both
for
about
two
years
ago
as
we
were
walking
together
at
midnight
on
the
terrace
of
the
palace
that
forms
the
edge
of
the
city
wall
enjoying
the
cold
camphor
of
the
moon
after
the
heat
of
a
burning
day
suddenly
out
of
the
desert
we
heard
as
it
were
the
rush
of
wings
and
as
we
stood
and
listened
there
arose
in
the
air
a
sound
of
voices
like
those
of
a
man
and
woman
in
vehement
dispute
but
though
we
could
distinguish
the
tones
we
could
not
understand
the
meaning
for
the
language
was
unknown
to
us
and
then
after
a
while
those
two
invisible
appeared
all
at
once
before
our
eyes
seated
on
the
battlements
in
the
form
of
a
pair
of
vultures
and
immediately
the
male
vulture
spoke
with
a
human
voice
saying
o
king
give
me
now
this
daughter
of
thine
to
wife
and
instantly
i
answered
rashly
never
will
i
bestow
my
daughter
on
a
bird
of
such
as
thou
art
thereupon
that
suitor
laughed
like
a
hyæna
and
instantly
my
daughter
fell
into
a
swoon
and
as
she
lay
in
the
moonlight
she
looked
so
indescribably
and
unutterably
beautiful
that
even
that
loathsome
bird
was
moved
and
he
said
to
his
companion
daughter
i
was
right
and
thou
wert
wrong
look
and
see
and
allow
that
she
is
far
more
beautiful
than
even
thou
art
thereupon
that
laughed
also
and
she
said
time
shall
show
listen
king
this
is
kírttisena
a
nephew
of
wásuki
king
of
the
snakes
and
i
am
his
only
daughter
for
this
form
of
vulture
was
assumed
by
us
only
to
converse
with
thee
now
he
maintained
thy
daughter
to
be
more
beautiful
than
i
am
thereupon
i
vowed
vengeance
but
i
agreed
to
leave
her
unmolested
if
thou
didst
give
her
to
him
for
a
wife
so
to
preserve
her
from
my
vengeance
he
asked
her
of
thee
in
marriage
now
then
since
thou
hast
rejected
his
suit
despising
him
hastily
for
his
outward
form
and
since
my
own
beauty
has
been
slighted
by
his
comparison
ye
two
shall
be
punished
she
for
her
beauty
and
thou
for
thine
insolence
and
through
the
means
of
that
very
beauty
on
account
of
which
my
father
and
i
have
become
contemptible
see
o
thou
who
despisest
a
suitor
whether
thou
canst
easily
procure
another
this
shall
be
the
condition
of
thy
daughter
marriage
whatever
suitor
shall
lay
claim
to
her
thou
shalt
send
up
to
this
terrace
alone
at
night
and
if
he
claims
and
does
not
come
we
will
swallow
thy
city
whole
houses
and
all
then
those
two
vultures
disappeared
and
not
long
afterwards
hearing
that
my
daughter
was
to
be
given
in
marriage
suitors
arrived
like
swarms
of
bees
from
every
quarter
of
the
world
attracted
by
her
fame
for
she
is
called
yashowatí
because
the
fame
of
her
fills
the
world
then
all
those
suitors
followed
one
another
like
the
days
of
the
year
in
which
they
went
up
upon
the
terrace
of
the
city
wall
and
like
those
days
not
one
of
them
all
has
ever
returned
but
they
have
vanished
utterly
none
knows
how
or
where
and
when
all
the
distant
suitors
were
exhausted
and
all
the
neighbouring
kings
then
in
my
ardent
desire
to
get
her
married
no
matter
how
to
no
matter
whom
i
offered
her
to
the
men
of
my
own
city
showing
her
to
them
from
the
palace
windows
and
every
man
that
saw
her
ran
to
win
her
and
one
by
one
the
men
of
the
city
followed
after
her
former
suitors
till
they
grew
few
in
the
city
thereupon
the
women
banded
together
and
took
their
husbands
and
their
sons
and
everything
in
the
shape
of
a
man
and
hid
them
and
now
as
thou
seest
there
is
not
a
man
to
be
seen
or
found
in
the
whole
city
but
every
stranger
that
comes
to
the
city
they
catch
and
bring
him
straight
to
me
as
they
have
done
in
thy
case
also
and
the
mere
sight
of
my
daughter
always
makes
him
not
only
willing
but
as
thou
art
even
eager
to
marry
her
at
any
cost
and
yet
they
have
all
utterly
vanished
like
stones
dropped
one
after
another
into
a
well
without
a
floor
and
there
is
my
daughter
maiden
and
unmarried
still
and
i
can
see
my
ancestors
wringing
their
hands
for
grief
knowing
well
that
as
soon
as
i
myself
am
dead
it
is
all
over
with
their
race
for
who
will
offer
them
water
since
the
fatal
beauty
of
my
only
daughter
has
set
a
term
to
my
ancient
line
so
as
aja
stood
lost
in
wonder
at
the
old
king
story
his
daughter
suddenly
rose
to
her
feet
with
a
shrill
cry
and
she
exclaimed
o
son
of
a
king
fly
quickly
hence
away
back
with
thee
even
into
the
desert
and
leave
me
and
my
father
and
this
miserable
city
to
our
inevitable
fate
and
she
sank
down
in
a
swoon
and
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
but
that
aja
sprang
quickly
forward
and
caught
her
as
she
fell
so
as
he
stood
holding
her
in
his
arms
and
wishing
that
her
swoon
might
last
for
ever
so
only
that
he
held
her
for
she
stole
away
his
senses
with
the
seduction
of
her
fragrance
and
proximity
her
father
exclaimed
in
dismay
ha
this
is
something
new
and
a
thing
that
has
never
occurred
before
and
what
can
be
the
matter
now
o
son
of
a
king
she
must
have
fallen
in
love
with
thee
as
well
indeed
she
might
for
thy
beauty
and
thy
youth
and
doubtless
it
has
grieved
her
soul
to
think
of
thy
approaching
end
but
alas
alas
this
is
worse
than
all
for
now
if
thou
fallest
a
victim
as
can
not
fail
to
be
the
case
like
all
thy
predecessors
she
will
herself
not
survive
thee
and
then
indeed
there
is
an
end
of
all
for
as
long
as
she
was
left
to
be
married
there
was
still
a
shadow
of
hope
behind
and
he
began
to
ramble
about
wringing
his
hands
for
grief
but
aja
said
to
himself
with
joy
ha
this
was
all
i
wanted
if
only
it
be
true
and
he
said
to
the
king
o
king
it
will
be
time
enough
to
afflict
thyself
for
her
death
or
for
mine
when
we
have
actually
died
but
count
me
in
the
meantime
as
thy
and
be
under
no
anxiety
as
to
the
fate
of
thy
ancestors
for
i
will
guarantee
their
good
condition
and
this
very
night
i
will
rid
thee
of
the
evil
demon
that
molests
her
and
tomorrow
i
will
take
this
hand
and
lead
her
round
the
fire
and
he
took
her
hand
as
she
lay
in
his
arms
and
touched
it
with
his
lips
it
may
not
be
superfluous
to
remind
the
english
reader
that
according
to
hindoo
ideas
there
is
no
disgrace
like
that
of
possessing
an
unmarried
daughter
hence
the
practice
among
the
rajpoots
and
adjacent
peoples
of
destroying
the
female
infants
to
avoid
it
intending
of
course
a
son
unfortunately
he
employed
a
word
of
indeterminate
gender
hence
the
lamentable
for
in
ancient
india
as
in
ancient
rome
the
spoken
word
the
letter
determined
everything
nothing
in
hindoo
mythology
is
more
absurd
than
the
implacable
fury
of
the
most
holy
men
for
the
most
trifling
slights
unless
it
be
the
accuracy
with
which
their
most
dreadful
imprecations
are
literally
fulfilled
this
was
i
believe
characteristic
also
of
the
saints
of
erin
an
english
lady
having
called
not
long
ago
at
the
house
of
a
hindoo
lady
to
enquire
how
she
was
after
an
interesting
event
and
was
the
received
for
answer
alas
nothing
at
a
girl
had
she
been
a
partisan
of
woman
rights
she
would
probably
never
have
recovered
from
the
shock
a
play
on
words
not
transferable
to
english
it
is
a
very
bad
omen
in
india
for
a
vulture
to
settle
on
a
house
a
female
vulture
i
retain
the
original
word
because
it
seems
to
be
peculiarly
expressive
of
the
thing
that
is
marry
her
v
and
instantly
as
though
his
kiss
had
been
to
her
like
sandal
and
like
fans
she
came
back
to
herself
and
when
she
saw
who
held
her
she
started
up
and
stood
blushing
the
colour
of
her
own
lips
with
eyes
cast
upon
the
ground
and
the
king
said
o
daughter
what
is
this
does
it
become
a
high
caste
maiden
outwardly
to
exhibit
her
inward
feelings
and
abandon
the
straight
line
of
virgin
modesty
by
behaviour
that
betrays
her
heart
and
then
yashowatí
sighed
deeply
and
she
looked
for
a
while
in
silence
first
at
her
father
and
then
at
aja
and
all
at
once
she
stood
erect
like
one
seized
by
sudden
resolution
and
she
clapped
her
hands
together
and
exclaimed
in
a
voice
that
shook
and
quivered
with
emotion
ha
who
can
hide
a
forest
fire
by
covering
it
over
with
a
little
straw
or
what
does
maiden
conduct
matter
in
the
ruin
of
the
three
worlds
aye
the
fire
of
grief
consumed
me
to
see
this
noble
son
of
a
king
and
to
think
that
he
escaped
the
desert
only
to
meet
his
death
from
me
now
has
my
punishment
come
upon
me
in
the
form
of
this
tall
and
splendid
youth
for
i
grieved
for
the
fate
of
my
former
suitors
and
yet
i
saw
them
for
all
that
go
one
by
one
to
their
useless
doom
and
still
myself
remained
alive
long
ago
beyond
a
doubt
i
ought
myself
to
have
left
the
body
and
perished
of
my
own
accord
rather
than
consent
to
live
the
cause
of
death
to
so
many
others
and
by
putting
myself
to
death
i
should
have
cut
in
two
the
fatal
chain
of
their
succession
and
saved
their
lives
by
the
substitute
of
my
own
and
now
instead
i
have
been
as
it
were
their
murderess
and
a
death
to
them
all
in
female
form
and
now
the
deity
has
avenged
them
by
sending
to
me
at
last
the
god
of
love
in
human
shape
whose
death
will
be
a
grief
to
me
a
hundred
fold
more
awful
than
any
death
i
could
have
died
and
i
myself
shall
not
survive
him
then
why
waste
time
in
chiding
one
who
has
but
one
more
day
to
live
for
as
soon
as
night
arrives
he
must
go
like
the
rest
to
meet
his
doom
and
certain
it
is
that
i
shall
not
live
to
see
the
sun
rise
again
without
him
and
as
she
spoke
they
gazed
at
her
astonished
for
she
seemed
like
one
that
has
burst
the
bonds
of
all
restraint
and
thrown
all
consideration
to
the
eight
quarters
of
the
world
but
as
soon
as
she
stopped
the
old
king
uttered
a
doleful
cry
and
he
exclaimed
yashowatí
o
daughter
what
words
are
these
is
it
any
fault
of
thine
that
thou
art
beautiful
and
wilt
thou
talk
of
abandoning
the
body
then
what
will
become
of
the
family
of
which
thou
art
the
only
hope
but
aja
laughed
and
he
said
o
lovely
lady
waste
not
thy
grief
on
such
a
thing
as
i
am
and
o
cease
from
bewailing
calamities
that
are
only
the
shadows
of
thy
own
fears
cast
upon
the
dark
curtain
of
the
future
for
many
are
they
that
are
doomed
to
die
yet
never
perish
after
all
and
i
have
not
escaped
the
sand
to
perish
lightly
in
any
other
way
be
assured
that
the
lamp
of
thy
race
is
burning
still
with
a
steady
flame
not
to
be
extinguished
by
a
little
puff
of
wind
we
will
laugh
together
over
these
idle
apprehensions
which
the
rising
sun
will
dissipate
together
with
the
mists
of
night
but
yashowatí
turned
and
looked
at
him
with
steady
eyes
and
she
said
my
husband
for
such
indeed
thou
art
the
first
that
i
have
ever
chosen
and
the
last
that
shall
ever
claim
my
hand
dost
thou
think
that
i
would
have
so
far
forgotten
the
reserve
that
is
becoming
to
a
maiden
of
my
caste
as
to
offer
myself
like
an
but
that
i
know
as
thou
canst
not
know
it
the
absolute
and
utterly
inevitable
certainty
of
thy
doom
and
that
this
is
the
very
last
day
we
shall
spend
together
though
it
is
also
the
very
first
and
aja
looked
at
her
with
affection
and
he
laughed
again
and
he
said
sweet
wife
since
thou
art
so
very
certain
then
as
it
must
be
let
it
be
what
care
i
for
if
i
am
with
thee
all
knowing
that
but
an
hour
ago
when
first
i
saw
thee
i
would
have
given
my
life
doubly
dear
as
it
was
by
reason
of
its
recent
escape
from
death
to
win
from
thee
a
little
love
even
a
very
little
but
as
it
is
a
single
day
is
life
enough
provided
it
is
spent
with
thee
even
though
i
were
really
destined
never
to
see
another
and
she
looked
at
him
with
wistful
eyes
and
after
a
while
she
said
thou
art
brave
and
as
i
would
have
had
thee
and
thou
dost
not
believe
me
and
it
may
be
it
is
better
so
and
then
she
turned
to
the
king
and
said
o
father
go
away
now
and
leave
me
alone
with
my
husband
and
be
not
afraid
either
for
thy
honour
or
my
own
for
there
shall
be
as
it
were
a
sword
between
us
but
i
wish
to
have
him
all
to
myself
until
the
end
and
when
the
time
has
come
let
the
gong
be
sounded
and
i
will
send
him
out
to
thee
and
thou
canst
show
him
the
way
to
death
and
thereupon
the
old
king
went
away
as
she
desired
moaning
and
muttering
and
wringing
his
hands
with
grief
so
when
he
was
gone
those
two
lovers
sat
together
all
day
long
gazing
at
each
other
like
the
sunflower
and
the
sun
and
he
utterly
forgot
the
morrow
but
it
never
left
her
mind
even
for
a
single
instant
and
she
made
him
relate
to
her
his
whole
life
from
the
very
beginning
drinking
in
his
words
and
hanging
on
his
lips
and
watching
him
keenly
with
eyes
that
never
left
his
face
holding
all
the
while
his
hand
with
the
grasp
of
one
who
knows
that
her
husband
must
be
led
to
execution
in
the
evening
and
she
said
to
herself
at
every
moment
still
he
is
here
still
he
is
here
and
when
the
sun
set
she
sent
for
food
and
delicacies
and
wine
and
fed
him
like
a
child
with
her
own
hand
tasting
herself
nothing
and
she
surfeited
him
with
the
honey
of
her
sweetness
and
the
syrup
of
her
kisses
and
the
nectar
of
the
young
new
moon
of
beauty
bathed
in
the
sun
of
love
the
redder
because
of
its
approaching
set
and
all
at
once
she
started
to
her
feet
in
the
very
middle
of
a
caress
and
she
stood
listening
and
aja
listened
also
and
he
heard
in
the
silence
the
sound
of
a
gong
so
as
he
watched
her
she
turned
paler
and
ever
paler
like
the
east
at
the
break
of
dawn
and
she
put
her
two
hands
together
and
pressed
them
tight
against
her
heart
and
then
against
her
brow
and
all
at
once
she
came
quickly
to
him
and
said
in
a
low
voice
it
is
time
and
she
took
his
head
in
her
hands
and
kissed
him
with
lips
that
were
cold
as
ice
and
yet
hot
as
fire
first
on
the
eyes
and
then
on
the
mouth
and
last
of
all
upon
the
brow
and
then
she
took
his
hand
and
held
it
for
a
little
while
with
a
clutch
that
almost
hurt
him
gazing
at
him
with
thirsty
eyes
and
suddenly
she
threw
away
his
hand
and
pushed
him
away
roughly
saying
go
but
aja
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
yet
again
as
it
were
against
her
will
and
he
said
o
fearful
heart
be
not
afraid
very
soon
i
will
return
and
he
went
away
quickly
but
at
the
door
he
turned
and
saw
her
standing
still
watching
him
with
dry
bright
eyes
and
lips
that
were
shut
tight
and
at
that
very
moment
the
old
king
took
him
by
the
arm
and
said
come
now
and
i
will
show
thee
the
way
by
which
all
thy
predecessors
went
before
thee
then
aja
said
o
king
i
am
unarmed
give
me
a
weapon
to
carry
with
me
so
the
king
took
him
into
the
armoury
and
he
chose
for
himself
a
sword
almost
as
long
as
he
was
tall
but
he
threw
away
the
scabbard
saying
this
would
only
be
in
the
way
and
now
i
am
prepared
and
then
the
king
led
him
away
and
up
a
winding
stair
and
when
they
were
at
the
top
he
stopped
and
he
said
o
that
might
have
been
now
fare
thee
well
and
even
i
feel
it
harder
to
part
with
thee
than
with
any
of
thy
predecessors
thou
wouldst
have
made
an
altogether
appropriate
husband
for
my
daughter
and
o
that
thou
couldst
have
seen
her
dance
before
thus
disappearing
but
now
it
is
too
late
for
i
doubt
whether
tumburu
himself
could
make
her
dance
so
troubled
did
she
seem
to
be
at
bidding
thee
go
out
now
through
yonder
door
and
thou
wilt
be
more
fortunate
than
all
the
others
if
thou
canst
manage
to
return
through
it
then
he
went
back
into
the
palace
but
aja
passed
through
the
door
and
found
himself
on
the
city
wall
this
was
the
privilege
of
kings
daughters
a
play
on
words
meaning
also
a
total
eclipse
illustration
hindu
script
kith
and
kin
and
home
forget
and
all
to
sail
beyond
the
setting
sun
with
me
where
dead
love
dreamy
recollections
call
across
the
a
total
eclipse
i
and
he
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
city
wall
with
his
naked
sword
in
his
hand
and
he
looked
on
this
side
and
on
that
and
saw
the
turrets
of
the
city
jutting
out
along
the
wall
like
the
huge
black
heads
of
elephants
of
war
advancing
in
a
line
and
behind
him
lay
the
city
covered
over
with
a
pall
of
black
that
was
edged
and
touched
with
silver
points
and
fringes
and
before
him
the
desert
stretched
away
smeared
as
it
were
with
ashes
under
the
light
of
the
moon
and
brave
as
he
was
his
heart
beat
just
a
very
little
in
expectation
of
what
was
coming
and
he
said
to
himself
my
dismissal
was
not
very
reassuring
but
where
then
is
the
danger
and
from
what
quarter
is
it
coming
and
what
form
will
it
take
for
here
is
nothing
whatever
to
fight
with
except
the
shadows
cast
by
the
moon
or
is
this
all
merely
a
trick
of
the
king
to
test
me
before
which
all
my
predecessors
have
ignominiously
failed
yet
no
for
were
it
so
my
wife
would
indeed
be
an
actress
capable
of
reducing
tumburu
to
the
state
of
ashes
so
as
he
stood
waiting
and
smiling
at
his
own
thoughts
it
happened
that
that
daughter
of
kírttisena
whose
jealousy
of
the
king
daughter
had
caused
all
the
trouble
in
the
king
city
came
according
to
her
custom
flying
towards
the
city
wall
for
every
night
she
came
to
see
whether
there
was
a
new
suitor
and
whenever
she
discovered
one
she
had
recourse
to
a
rákshasa
that
was
bound
to
her
by
obligations
who
came
as
soon
as
thought
of
and
swallowed
that
unhappy
suitor
whole
and
now
for
some
time
no
new
suitor
had
appeared
so
as
she
came
flying
in
the
likeness
of
a
bat
she
looked
towards
the
city
wall
expecting
to
find
it
empty
and
she
saw
instead
aja
standing
leaning
on
his
sword
and
smiling
on
the
very
edge
of
the
wall
and
at
the
very
first
glance
at
him
she
was
struck
with
stupor
and
she
fell
that
very
moment
so
violently
in
love
with
him
that
she
could
hardly
flap
her
wings
by
reason
of
the
fierce
agitation
of
her
heart
so
she
alighted
on
the
wall
a
little
distance
off
and
remained
watching
him
hardly
able
to
breathe
for
emotion
in
her
own
form
but
surrounding
herself
with
a
veil
of
invisibility
to
escape
his
observation
and
after
a
while
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
murmured
to
herself
ha
this
is
a
suitor
indeed
very
different
from
all
the
others
and
rather
than
a
mere
mortal
man
he
resembles
the
son
of
dewakí
with
rádhá
caressing
him
in
the
form
of
the
moonlight
that
seems
to
cling
affectionately
to
his
glorious
limbs
ha
he
looks
like
the
tutelary
deity
of
the
city
come
to
defy
me
bringing
the
god
of
love
to
his
aid
in
the
form
of
his
own
marvellous
and
incomparable
beauty
aye
and
i
feel
that
i
am
defeated
already
before
the
battle
has
so
much
as
begun
and
then
all
at
once
a
spasm
of
rage
shot
through
her
heart
and
she
turned
pale
and
she
exclaimed
ah
but
i
am
anticipated
by
this
accursed
king
daughter
who
will
rob
me
of
him
nay
has
already
done
it
by
her
undeniable
hateful
beauty
and
her
priority
of
claim
alas
alas
o
why
did
i
not
see
him
first
before
her
abominable
loveliness
had
made
an
impression
on
his
heart
for
he
is
very
young
and
it
must
be
open
to
the
spell
of
beauty
and
artless
and
sincere
ha
and
suddenly
she
started
up
as
if
an
idea
had
rushed
into
her
mind
and
she
stood
for
a
moment
thinking
and
then
she
exclaimed
with
a
gesture
of
resolution
yes
i
also
am
beautiful
now
then
i
will
efface
her
image
from
his
heart
and
replace
it
by
my
own
now
i
will
assault
him
by
all
the
power
of
my
charms
and
we
will
see
whether
he
will
be
proof
against
the
glamour
of
a
beauty
such
as
mine
multiplied
and
magnified
by
magic
sorcery
and
fierce
determination
aye
i
will
move
heaven
and
earth
to
steal
his
heart
from
the
king
daughter
and
turn
pátála
upside
down
to
make
him
mine
instead
of
hers
but
if
i
fail
and
again
she
turned
deadly
pale
and
after
a
while
a
bitter
smile
curled
over
her
lips
and
she
said
if
if
i
fail
no
but
i
will
not
fail
but
if
i
fail
then
i
will
take
another
way
an
actress

a
dancer

the
same

this

of

of

great

ii
so
as
aja
stood
upon
the
wall
looking
out
over
the
desert
suddenly
all
vanished
from
before
his
eyes
and
he
saw
before
him
no
city
and
no
desert
but
he
found
himself
in
a
dusky
wood
thick
with
tall
trees
and
lit
by
a
light
that
was
neither
that
of
the
sun
nor
that
of
the
moon
and
all
around
him
huge
red
poppies
waved
gently
without
a
wind
mixed
with
great
whose
perfume
went
and
came
by
turns
as
it
hung
on
the
heavy
air
and
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
large
bats
flew
here
and
there
with
slow
and
noiseless
flap
and
on
the
branches
monstrous
owls
with
topaz
eyes
like
wheels
of
flame
sat
motionless
as
if
to
watch
and
a
dead
silence
like
that
of
space
whence
all
three
worlds
have
been
removed
left
aja
nothing
else
to
hear
but
the
beat
of
his
own
heart
and
the
hair
rose
up
upon
his
head
with
sheer
amazement
and
he
said
to
himself
ha
what
new
wonder
is
this
and
what
has
become
of
the
city
wall
and
where
in
the
world
have
i
got
to
now
and
how
now
let
me
be
very
wary
for
the
danger
is
evidently
coming
near
and
as
he
stood
grasping
his
sword
prepared
and
looking
quickly
right
and
left
suddenly
he
saw
a
thing
which
rivetted
his
gaze
to
it
as
if
with
an
iron
nail
a
little
way
off
among
the
poppies
was
standing
up
like
a
lonely
column
all
that
was
left
of
one
of
the
walls
of
a
ruined
temple
whose
fallen
pillars
were
lying
scattered
all
around
it
half
concealed
by
creeping
leaves
and
as
he
gazed
intently
at
this
upright
fragment
of
a
fallen
wall
he
saw
upon
it
the
image
of
a
sculptured
woman
which
stood
out
so
distinctly
that
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
it
and
after
a
while
he
said
to
himself
surely
that
can
be
no
stone
statue
but
a
real
woman
of
flesh
and
blood
actually
leaning
who
knows
why
against
that
bit
of
a
broken
wall
and
he
looked
and
looked
and
after
a
while
filled
with
irresistible
curiosity
he
went
nearer
but
very
slowly
and
as
it
were
on
his
guard
to
see
so
as
he
gazed
wonder
and
admiration
gradually
crept
into
his
soul
and
stole
his
recollection
unaware
and
he
became
wholly
intent
on
the
stone
image
and
forgetful
of
his
situation
and
he
ceased
to
wonder
at
finding
himself
in
the
wood
so
great
was
his
new
wonder
at
the
beauty
of
the
woman
on
the
wall
and
he
said
to
himself
surely
he
was
a
master
artist
whoever
he
was
that
made
this
woman
out
of
stone
if
stone
indeed
she
be
for
even
now
near
as
i
am
i
can
hardly
believe
she
is
made
of
stone
and
the
more
he
looked
the
more
he
marvelled
for
she
seemed
in
his
eyes
like
a
frozen
mass
of
lunar
camphor
moulded
into
a
female
form
standing
cold
and
pure
and
still
alone
by
herself
in
that
strange
half
light
that
hovered
as
it
were
irresolute
between
the
natures
of
night
and
day
and
she
stood
with
her
right
hand
on
her
hip
which
jutted
out
to
receive
it
like
the
curve
of
a
breaking
wave
and
her
bare
right
breast
stood
out
and
shone
like
a
great
moonlit
sea
pearl
while
the
other
was
hiding
behind
the
curling
fold
of
the
pale
green
garment
that
ran
around
her
embracing
her
with
clinging
clasp
like
a
winding
wisp
of
emerald
foam
fondly
wrapping
the
yielding
waist
of
wishnu
wife
and
she
was
very
tall
and
shaped
like
shrí
and
she
stood
with
her
head
a
little
bent
and
her
sightless
eyes
fixed
as
it
were
on
empty
space
just
as
though
she
were
listening
for
some
expected
sound
and
as
he
continued
to
gaze
at
her
a
wonder
that
was
almost
horror
crept
into
his
mind
for
her
face
was
not
like
that
of
an
image
but
rather
resembled
a
mask
or
the
face
of
a
very
beautiful
woman
that
very
moment
dead
for
the
colour
seemed
as
it
were
to
have
only
just
faded
from
her
cheek
and
the
blood
seemed
only
just
before
to
have
left
her
pallid
lips
and
the
sight
was
as
it
were
hanging
yet
in
her
great
long
open
eyes
that
were
fixed
on
the
distant
sky
and
he
stood
gazing
as
if
the
very
sight
of
her
had
made
of
him
another
image
like
herself
and
then
at
last
he
stepped
forward
and
he
put
out
his
left
hand
and
touched
her
with
his
forefinger
on
the
shoulder
that
was
bare
and
instantly
as
if
his
touch
had
filled
her
with
a
flood
of
life
a
shiver
ran
like
quicksilver
over
her
stony
limbs
and
as
he
started
back
to
watch
the
colour
came
back
into
her
face
and
red
blood
rushed
into
her
lips
and
deep
blue
suddenly
filled
her
eyes
and
the
tresses
of
hair
around
her
head
turned
all
of
a
sudden
a
glossy
black
that
shone
with
a
lustre
as
if
reflecting
the
grassy
sheen
of
her
winding
robe
and
her
bosom
lifted
slowly
and
fell
again
with
a
deep
sigh
and
all
at
once
she
abruptly
altered
her
position
and
her
eyes
fell
straight
on
aja
standing
just
before
her
and
she
lifted
up
first
one
eyebrow
and
then
the
other
till
they
formed
a
perfect
bow
for
they
joined
each
other
in
the
middle
and
she
uttered
a
faint
cry
as
if
in
joy
exclaiming
ha
can
it
be
and
is
it
thou
or
am
i
dreaming
still
a
tree
with
very
black
bark
and
white
blossoms
dear
to
erotic
poets
such
as
jayadewa
iii
and
aja
stood
staring
at
her
with
stony
gaze
like
a
mirror
of
her
own
surprise
and
he
said
to
himself
surely
it
is
not
she
but
i
myself
that
am
the
dreamer
for
here
since
the
sun
rose
last
i
have
escaped
the
desert
and
found
this
city
without
a
man
and
acquired
a
bride
of
peerless
beauty
and
now
here
is
another
rising
as
it
were
from
the
dead
and
seeming
to
expect
me
and
he
continued
standing
silent
gazing
at
her
sword
in
hand
and
after
a
while
she
said
what
is
my
form
then
so
frightful
as
to
rob
thee
of
thy
tongue
or
art
thou
going
to
use
that
sword
against
me
speak
but
in
the
meanwhile
let
me
see
whether
i
have
lost
the
use
of
my
limbs
as
thou
hast
that
of
thy
tongue
after
so
long
a
sleep
and
she
leaped
from
her
little
pedestal
and
moved
a
little
way
here
and
there
waving
her
beautiful
arms
about
and
after
a
while
she
came
back
and
sat
down
just
before
him
on
one
of
the
fallen
pillars
that
were
lying
about
the
ground
and
all
the
while
aja
watched
her
as
if
fascinated
by
a
serpent
saying
within
himself
she
moves
like
nothing
i
ever
saw
save
a
panther
or
a
gliding
snake
and
then
all
at
once
she
again
put
up
one
eyebrow
and
said
to
him
with
a
smile
must
i
then
actually
tell
thee
that
i
am
natabhrúkutí
then
aja
said
o
lady
it
is
obvious
for
thy
bent
brow
would
plant
arrows
even
in
the
heart
of
the
great
ascetic
and
she
said
again
o
husband
is
this
thy
welcome
after
so
long
a
separation
and
aja
bounded
as
if
bitten
by
a
snake
and
he
exclaimed
thy
husband
what
am
i
then
thy
husband
also
does
thy
whole
sex
want
to
get
me
for
a
husband
but
o
thou
beauty
of
bending
brows
how
can
he
be
thy
husband
that
never
saw
thee
in
his
life
before
and
only
this
morning
i
was
still
wifeless
and
a
day
has
not
elapsed
since
i
became
another
husband
and
he
stopped
short
again
confounded
at
the
effect
of
his
own
words
for
hardly
had
they
passed
his
lips
when
natabhrúkutí
started
up
swelling
with
rage
and
convulsed
with
fury
with
eyes
that
blazed
like
fiery
stars
and
she
exclaimed
never
never
never
shall
she
possess
thee
nor
any
other
than
i
myself
and
then
like
a
flash
of
lightning
her
rage
vanished
as
quickly
as
it
came
and
she
looked
at
him
with
imploring
eyes
and
said
slay
me
now
with
thy
long
bright
sword
and
send
me
back
to
that
nonentity
out
of
which
thou
hast
just
recalled
me
but
speak
not
of
another
woman
in
front
of
me
alas
and
am
i
all
forgotten
and
tears
rolled
from
her
great
blue
eyes
and
fell
like
suppliants
at
her
feet
and
aja
put
up
his
left
hand
and
tugged
at
his
hair
in
the
extremity
of
his
amazement
and
he
said
o
thou
strange
offended
lady
i
am
utterly
bewildered
and
resemble
one
that
has
lost
his
way
at
midnight
in
a
wood
and
thy
anger
and
thy
grief
are
alike
altogether
incomprehensible
how
can
i
possibly
have
forgotten
one
whom
as
i
just
now
told
thee
i
never
saw
in
my
life
before
then
she
said
nay
not
in
this
life
but
the
last
for
i
was
the
wife
of
thy
former
birth
then
aja
laughed
and
he
said
o
beauty
who
remembers
his
former
birth
for
like
every
other
man
and
like
my
ancestor
the
sun
i
have
risen
up
into
light
out
of
the
sea
of
dark
oblivion
into
which
i
must
sink
again
at
last
and
then
she
looked
at
him
with
a
deep
sigh
and
she
said
alas
this
is
a
punishment
indeed
and
worse
by
far
than
all
the
rest
if
after
having
endured
so
long
the
state
of
a
stone
upon
a
wall
i
am
again
become
a
woman
only
to
find
myself
repudiated
and
all
forgotten
by
him
on
whose
account
i
suffered
all
listen
then
and
i
will
tell
thee
the
story
of
thy
former
birth
it
may
be
that
in
the
hearing
some
scattered
reminiscences
will
be
as
it
were
awakened
to
stir
again
in
the
dark
lethargy
of
thy
sleeping
soul
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
to
see
a
cobra
move
nothing
can
describe
it
that
is
beauty
of
the
arched
pronounce
to
rhyme
with
iv
and
then
she
began
to
speak
and
as
she
spoke
she
leaned
forward
as
she
sat
upon
the
fallen
pillar
and
fastened
her
great
eager
eyes
like
magnets
on
his
own
and
as
aja
watched
them
they
played
as
it
were
upon
his
heart
for
their
colour
wavered
and
changed
and
faltered
shifting
ever
from
hue
to
hue
turning
golden
and
ruddy
amber
and
and
and
over
her
eyes
her
arching
brows
lifted
and
fell
and
played
and
flickered
fixing
his
troubled
soul
like
nails
and
rivetting
his
attention
till
her
singing
voice
sounded
in
his
head
like
a
distant
tune
crooned
in
the
ear
of
a
sleepy
man
and
she
waved
slowly
her
long
round
arms
all
the
while
she
spoke
and
she
said
far
away
over
the
sea
lies
thy
own
forgotten
land
and
presently
i
will
tell
thee
and
even
show
thee
where
it
is
and
there
it
was
in
our
former
birth
that
thou
and
i
were
boy
and
girl
but
thou
wert
the
son
of
a
mighty
king
and
i
was
only
a
brahmani
a
poor
man
daughter
and
my
father
was
an
old
ascetic
far
below
thee
in
everything
else
but
caste
and
i
lived
alone
with
my
old
father
in
the
very
heart
of
a
great
forest
in
a
little
hut
of
bark
over
which
the
creeper
grew
so
thick
that
nothing
was
visible
of
that
little
hut
except
its
door
and
then
one
day
i
was
seen
by
thee
standing
still
in
that
very
door
with
my
pitcher
on
my
head
as
thou
wert
passing
through
the
wood
to
hunt
upon
thy
horse
and
that
moment
was
like
a
sponge
that
blotted
from
the
mind
of
each
everything
but
the
other
image
and
i
made
of
thee
my
deity
and
forgot
everything
in
the
three
great
worlds
for
thee
alone
and
thou
that
day
didst
clean
forget
thy
hunting
or
rather
the
god
of
love
showed
thee
game
of
another
kind
and
from
pursuing
thou
didst
fall
to
wooing
a
quarry
that
wished
for
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
thy
prey
and
we
married
each
other
that
very
day
which
ah
thou
hast
all
forgotten
what
dost
thou
not
remember
how
i
used
to
meet
thee
every
day
in
the
little
hut
when
my
father
was
away
in
the
wood
engaged
in
meditation
what
hast
thou
really
all
forgotten
how
it
was
thy
supreme
delight
to
bring
me
garments
and
costly
jewels
which
i
put
on
for
thy
amusement
thy
of
the
little
hut
has
thy
memory
cast
away
every
vestige
of
reminiscence
of
thy
old
sweet
love
in
the
little
hut
so
then
it
happened
that
on
a
day
we
were
together
blind
and
drunk
with
each
other
presence
shut
within
the
little
hut
like
a
pair
of
bees
in
a
nectared
lotus
and
i
was
standing
like
an
idol
dressed
like
the
queen
of
a
loaded
with
gold
on
wrists
and
feet
with
great
pearls
wound
about
my
neck
and
thou
wert
contemplating
me
thy
creature
with
intoxication
and
hard
indeed
it
was
to
tell
which
of
us
two
was
the
idol
and
which
was
the
devotee
and
as
we
woke
up
from
a
kiss
that
lasted
like
infinity
lo
my
father
stood
before
us
and
he
said
slowly
abandoned
daughter
that
hast
forgot
thy
duty
in
thy
passion
for
this
king
son
become
what
thou
hast
represented
an
idol
of
stone
on
the
wall
of
a
ruined
temple
far
away
and
thou
her
guilty
lover
fall
again
into
another
birth
and
be
separated
from
thy
guilty
love
then
being
besought
by
us
to
fix
some
period
to
the
curse
he
said
again
when
ye
two
shall
meet
again
and
thy
husband
in
his
curiosity
shall
touch
thee
with
his
finger
she
shall
regain
her
woman
state
and
be
as
she
was
before
and
now
all
this
has
come
about
exactly
as
he
said
and
i
have
found
thee
once
again
only
to
find
alas
alas
that
thou
hast
left
thy
heart
behind
thee
in
that
old
delicious
birth
in
sanskrit
hunting
and
wooing
can
be
mixed
up
together
by
plays
on
words
an
emperor
hindoo
idols
are
dressed
and
undressed
like
dolls
by
their
officiating
priests
she
means
he
was
her
creator
the
hindoos
have
no
word
because
they
have
not
the
idea
of
an
they
call
it
a
or
an
our
word
implies
the
antagonism
to
paganism
involved
in
christianity
and
no
two
books
are
more
alike
than
augustine
of
and
ward
v
so
as
he
listened
aja
soul
was
filled
as
it
were
with
a
mingled
essence
of
wonder
and
irresolution
and
sheeny
beauty
and
singing
sound
for
the
tone
of
her
voice
was
like
a
lute
and
before
his
eyes
hovered
a
picture
of
waving
arms
and
witching
curves
out
of
which
her
dreamy
eyes
from
which
he
could
not
take
his
own
seemed
as
it
were
to
speak
to
him
of
love
reproachful
and
old
regret
and
all
at
once
with
a
violent
effort
he
roused
himself
as
if
from
sleep
with
open
eyes
and
he
shifted
his
sword
to
the
other
hand
and
passed
his
right
across
his
brow
and
he
said
in
some
confusion
o
thou
strange
and
woman
certain
this
much
is
that
i
am
filled
by
thee
with
emotion
that
i
do
not
understand
and
yet
i
know
not
what
to
think
or
even
say
for
even
apart
from
the
promptings
of
a
former
birth
thy
beauty
and
thy
haunting
voice
which
i
seem
as
it
were
to
have
heard
before
are
quite
sufficient
to
rouse
emotion
even
in
a
stone
much
more
in
a
man
of
flesh
and
blood
then
she
shook
her
head
sadly
looking
at
him
with
glistening
eyes
and
she
said
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
sweetness
ah
this
is
as
i
thought
and
the
instinct
of
thy
former
birth
is
clouded
over
and
effaced
by
thy
meeting
with
this
other
woman
in
the
morning
of
this
very
day
alas
how
small
how
very
small
the
interval
of
space
and
time
that
divides
the
paradise
of
joy
from
the
dungeon
of
despair
for
had
this
our
reunion
been
sooner
by
only
a
single
day
i
should
have
caught
thy
heart
before
it
had
been
occupied
by
this
all
too
fortunate
other
woman
who
now
holds
it
like
a
fortress
garrisoned
by
a
prior
claim
but
what
is
this
priority
of
claim
can
she
who
by
thine
own
confession
has
known
thee
only
a
single
day
dare
to
dispute
priority
with
the
darling
of
thy
former
birth
wilt
thou
break
thy
faith
with
me
to
keep
thy
faith
with
her
aye
and
wilt
thou
after
all
gain
so
much
by
the
exchange
is
she
beautiful
then
this
other
woman
but
i
am
beautiful
too
and
she
stood
up
and
looked
at
aja
with
her
head
thrown
back
and
proud
eyes
as
though
to
challenge
his
condemnation
of
her
own
consummate
beauty
and
she
said
again
is
she
then
this
other
beauty
either
more
faithful
or
more
beautiful
than
i
am
speak
and
tell
me
if
thou
canst
in
what
i
am
inferior
or
why
i
am
to
be
despised
in
comparison
with
her
and
aja
looked
at
her
again
and
felt
abashed
and
half
ashamed
he
knew
not
why
and
he
murmured
to
himself
she
does
not
lie
for
beautiful
she
is
indeed
and
need
not
fear
comparison
with
any
woman
in
the
world
and
it
may
be
she
is
partly
right
and
if
i
had
met
her
yesterday
before
my
heart
was
full
she
would
have
had
little
difficulty
in
entering
in
and
capturing
it
almost
without
resistance
and
he
stood
looking
at
her
silently
uncertain
what
to
say
or
do
and
half
inclined
to
pity
her
and
half
afraid
of
her
and
of
himself
admiring
her
against
his
will
and
as
it
were
confessing
by
his
very
silence
the
power
of
her
appeal
for
notwithstanding
the
preoccupation
of
his
heart
his
youth
and
his
sex
became
as
it
were
allies
with
her
against
his
resolution
compelling
him
to
acknowledge
the
supremacy
of
the
cunning
god
and
the
spell
of
feminine
attraction
incarnate
in
her
form
and
she
stood
there
before
him
for
a
little
with
beauty
as
it
were
heightened
by
resentful
reproach
of
the
slighting
of
itself
and
the
disregard
of
its
tried
affection
and
then
all
at
once
she
sank
down
upon
the
ground
as
if
she
were
tired
and
remained
sitting
among
the
poppies
with
her
chin
resting
on
her
left
knee
which
she
embraced
with
her
arms
watching
him
and
as
it
were
waiting
with
humility
and
patience
for
a
decision
in
her
case
and
every
now
and
then
she
closed
her
eyes
and
opened
them
again
as
if
to
make
sure
that
he
was
there
and
aja
looked
round
in
the
silence
at
the
poppies
and
the
lotuses
and
the
great
owls
that
seemed
to
watch
him
and
back
again
at
her
and
his
head
began
to
whirl
and
he
muttered
to
himself
is
this
a
dream
and
what
does
it
all
mean
and
is
she
returning
to
the
condition
of
an
image
disgusted
by
my
coldness
and
disdain
and
what
is
to
be
done
and
he
looked
at
her
face
deprived
by
the
closing
of
their
lids
of
the
moon
of
her
eyes
and
resting
like
a
mask
upon
its
chin
and
he
said
within
himself
her
eyebrows
move
as
if
they
were
alive
and
he
felt
as
it
were
unable
to
look
away
from
them
and
at
last
annoyed
with
himself
he
closed
his
eyes
also
as
though
to
escape
their
persecution
though
in
europe
this
insidious
appeal
might
lack
force
it
is
otherwise
in
india
whose
millions
doubt
their
former
birth
no
more
than
they
doubt
their
own
existence
it
is
not
long
since
a
woman
in
cutch
burned
herself
with
her
own
dead
son
because
she
averred
he
had
been
her
husband
in
her
former
birth
vi
and
then
he
said
to
himself
this
is
cowardice
and
after
all
no
refuge
for
i
seem
to
see
her
still
through
the
shutters
of
my
lids
and
he
opened
his
eyes
once
more
and
instantly
he
leaped
from
the
ground
like
a
wounded
stag
with
a
cry
for
the
wood
with
all
its
lotuses
and
poppies
was
gone
and
in
its
place
he
saw
before
him
a
forest
with
its
great
green
trees
all
lit
by
the
shining
of
the
sun
and
just
in
front
of
him
there
stood
a
little
hut
buried
in
the
blossom
of
the
creeper
and
in
its
doorway
was
standing
a
young
brahman
woman
with
a
pitcher
on
her
head
and
she
beckoned
to
him
with
a
smile
and
he
looked
and
lo
it
was
natabhrúkutí
then
moved
as
if
against
his
will
on
feet
that
carried
him
towards
her
as
it
were
of
their
own
accord
he
approached
her
and
as
he
drew
nearer
there
came
from
that
creeper
a
wave
of
perfume
resembling
that
of
jasmine
but
sweeter
and
so
pungent
that
it
entered
like
fire
into
his
soul
and
then
she
lifted
the
pitcher
from
her
head
and
set
it
down
upon
the
ground
and
caught
him
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
within
the
hut
and
there
she
cast
herself
into
his
arms
whispering
in
his
ear
very
low
so
as
to
caress
it
as
she
spoke
with
her
lips
my
father
is
away
and
now
we
are
alone
and
the
day
is
all
before
us
come
now
what
shall
i
do
for
thy
delight
and
she
ran
and
shut
the
door
and
then
taking
from
a
chest
rich
clothes
and
splendid
jewels
she
began
to
put
them
on
saying
as
she
did
so
see
am
i
becoming
more
fit
to
be
thy
queen
and
he
watched
her
stupefied
like
one
in
a
dream
and
all
the
while
she
bathed
him
with
intoxicating
side
glances
shot
like
arrows
from
the
bow
of
her
arching
brows
and
at
last
she
came
slowly
towards
him
walking
on
and
attitudinising
placing
herself
exactly
in
the
posture
in
which
he
had
seen
her
first
among
the
poppies
on
the
wall
with
one
hand
on
her
hip
and
she
said
lifting
her
brow
with
a
smile
that
stole
his
reason
now
then
the
idol
is
ready
for
the
devotee
and
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
an
old
brahman
entered
through
it
and
he
said
slowly
abandoned
daughter
that
hast
forgot
thy
duty
in
thy
passion
for
this
king
son
become
what
thou
hast
represented
an
idol
of
stone
on
the
wall
of
a
ruined
temple
far
away
and
thou
her
guilty
lover
fall
into
another
birth
and
be
separated
from
thy
guilty
love
and
then
aja
heard
no
more
the
world
whirled
around
him
the
blackness
of
night
closed
over
his
soul
he
uttered
a
terrible
cry
and
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
swoon
vii
and
when
he
came
to
himself
he
was
back
again
among
the
poppies
in
the
wood
and
he
was
lying
on
the
ground
with
natabhrúkutí
bending
over
him
holding
him
by
the
hand
with
anxiety
in
her
eyes
and
instantly
he
started
up
and
seizing
his
sword
stood
gazing
at
her
with
stupefaction
and
he
said
to
himself
am
i
dead
or
dreaming
and
what
does
it
all
mean
is
it
a
delusion
of
the
creator
or
a
mirage
and
a
madness
of
the
desert
out
of
which
i
have
never
yet
escaped
at
all
aye
beyond
a
doubt
i
am
wandering
still
in
the
waste
of
sand
raving
mad
and
dying
and
haunted
by
phantoms
that
are
the
premonitors
of
approaching
death
so
as
he
stood
balancing
in
the
swing
of
perplexity
and
doubting
his
own
reason
natabhrúkutí
looked
at
him
fixedly
with
concern
and
affection
and
curiosity
in
her
eyes
and
she
said
surely
thou
art
and
why
then
dost
thou
shrink
from
me
as
though
i
were
a
thing
of
terror
i
who
ask
for
nothing
but
to
tend
thee
all
my
life
for
it
was
but
now
as
we
spoke
together
in
this
wood
i
looked
up
and
saw
thee
suddenly
close
thy
eyes
and
as
i
watched
thee
wondering
to
see
thee
sleeping
as
it
were
erect
there
burst
from
thy
lips
a
fearful
cry
and
i
had
but
time
to
catch
thee
falling
and
let
thee
sink
upon
the
ground
and
i
brought
thee
to
thyself
by
fanning
thee
as
well
as
i
might
with
this
great
leaf
and
she
held
it
up
before
him
while
he
continued
to
gaze
at
her
in
silence
and
as
he
did
not
speak
she
looked
at
him
curiously
and
muttered
under
her
breath
as
though
speaking
to
herself
and
not
intending
him
to
hear
can
he
have
suddenly
recollected
his
former
birth
and
is
this
the
reason
why
he
is
staring
at
me
as
if
wishing
to
compare
me
with
a
picture
in
his
head
and
as
he
still
kept
silence
presently
she
said
aloud
dear
thou
art
sick
and
much
in
need
of
medicines
such
as
i
alone
can
give
thee
why
wilt
thou
not
confide
in
me
for
i
am
a
cunning
leech
and
know
the
virtue
of
every
herb
and
every
vegetable
drug
better
than
dhanwantari
himself
and
i
have
made
myself
mistress
of
every
species
of
the
art
of
healing
and
in
particular
i
have
fed
myself
on
perfumes
and
on
the
essences
of
flowers
and
all
the
scented
odours
of
aromatic
shrubs
till
i
have
myself
become
as
it
were
a
very
attar
incarnate
in
a
woman
form
dost
thou
doubt
it
and
think
me
to
be
boasting
then
try
me
and
i
will
prove
to
thee
my
power
by
experiment
in
any
way
thou
wilt
i
will
soothe
and
shampoo
thee
with
a
hand
softer
than
a
fall
and
cooler
than
the
icy
moon
or
if
thou
wilt
i
will
croon
to
thee
old
airs
and
put
thee
to
sleep
like
a
tired
child
resting
thy
head
on
this
bosom
which
once
was
thy
delight
with
melodies
that
shall
speak
to
thee
of
drowzy
bees
and
moaning
winds
or
i
will
steal
thy
waking
senses
from
thee
and
lure
them
into
slumber
as
it
were
against
thy
will
by
snaring
them
with
fragrances
more
luscious
than
that
blossom
which
wishnu
once
trailed
through
the
intoxicated
world
to
drive
it
into
madness
at
the
moment
and
leave
it
filled
with
inconsolable
regret
when
it
was
gone
see
take
this
and
smell
it
and
thou
wilt
be
better
even
now
and
she
held
out
towards
him
in
the
lotus
of
her
hand
a
tiny
flower
in
colour
like
an
atom
of
the
concentrated
essence
of
the
sky
and
as
aja
looked
at
it
there
came
from
it
a
stream
of
a
sharp
and
biting
scent
that
rushed
into
his
soul
coming
laden
as
it
were
with
reminiscence
and
suggestions
of
the
past
so
that
he
said
to
himself
ha
of
what
does
this
remind
me
and
where
is
it
that
i
smelled
its
almost
intolerable
sweet
before
and
suddenly
the
little
hut
rushed
into
his
mind
and
he
exclaimed
it
is
the
very
smell
of
the
creeper
on
its
roof
and
instantly
a
feeling
of
amazement
that
almost
overcame
him
mingled
with
terror
crept
like
a
shudder
over
his
limbs
and
his
hair
stood
on
end
and
he
looked
at
natabhrúkutí
who
was
watching
him
intently
and
said
hoarsely
who
art
thou
thou
strange
beauty
and
what
dost
thou
want
of
me
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
inexplicable
mysteries
before
which
i
feel
as
if
my
reason
were
deserting
me
and
i
were
about
to
faint
again
the
physician
of
the
gods
the
hindoo
æsculapius
the
is
one
of
those
old
hindoo
medical
resources
which
we
have
only
recently
been
wise
enough
to
copy
viii
then
she
laughed
and
said
fair
boy
i
am
only
that
a
woman
and
i
want
no
more
than
what
every
woman
wants
the
man
she
loves
and
that
is
thou
aye
dost
thou
ask
me
who
and
what
i
am
listen
then
and
i
will
tell
thee
i
am
a
bee
which
not
like
other
bees
roams
roving
to
flower
after
flower
but
confines
itself
exclusively
to
one
i
am
a
breeze
which
not
like
other
breezes
blows
fickle
and
inconstant
now
hither
and
now
thither
but
is
fixed
and
ever
steady
coming
straight
from
malaya
laden
with
the
sandal
of
affection
to
lay
it
at
thy
feet
i
am
only
the
echo
of
a
voice
which
is
thyself
the
shadow
of
a
substance
and
the
reflection
of
a
sun
i
am
like
the
other
half
of
the
god
that
carries
the
moon
upon
his
head
the
twin
the
duplicate
and
counterpart
of
a
deity
who
is
thou
i
am
rati
rejoicing
to
find
again
the
body
of
her
husband
and
thou
art
love
himself
returned
to
life
whom
i
have
found
i
am
an
essence
of
the
ocean
but
unlike
it
i
hold
within
my
heart
not
many
pearls
but
only
one
which
is
thyself
i
am
a
wick
consuming
in
thy
flame
and
like
the
music
of
a
lute
i
am
a
thing
wholly
compounded
of
melodies
and
tones
whose
mood
and
being
are
dependent
on
the
player
who
is
thou
art
thou
sad
then
i
am
also
art
thou
joyous
so
am
i
my
soul
is
tossed
about
and
hangs
on
thy
smiling
or
thy
sighing
as
a
criminal
depends
on
the
sentence
of
the
judge
and
like
a
crystal
i
am
colourless
without
thee
but
ready
on
the
instant
to
assume
every
tinge
of
the
colour
of
thyself
cast
thy
eyes
upon
me
and
thou
shalt
see
as
in
a
glass
thy
every
mood
painted
on
the
surface
of
my
face
ah
dost
thou
ask
me
what
i
am
alas
i
am
a
target
for
the
poisoned
arrows
which
love
shoots
at
me
in
the
form
of
thy
beauty
greater
than
his
own
and
i
am
like
a
bare
and
withered
leafless
and
tree
which
has
suddenly
shot
up
into
blossom
at
the
coming
of
spring
in
thy
form
but
as
for
thee
why
o
why
dost
thou
regard
me
that
live
for
only
thee
as
if
i
were
a
deadly
snake
and
thou
a
startled
deer
in
vain
in
vain
dost
thou
endeavour
to
repel
me
for
i
will
not
be
repelled
i
will
melt
thy
cold
ice
in
thy
despite
by
the
fire
of
my
affection
and
drown
thee
in
its
flood
and
sweep
thee
away
from
the
rocks
of
thy
resistance
till
thou
art
lost
for
ever
in
its
dark
and
pearly
depths
and
as
aja
stood
listening
in
confusion
to
her
words
which
poured
from
her
like
a
torrent
suddenly
she
clapped
her
hands
and
exclaimed
as
he
started
again
at
her
vehemence
ha
shall
i
tell
thee
thou
wilful
and
reluctant
boy
of
what
thou
dost
remind
me
standing
as
it
were
aghast
and
obstinately
set
against
me
mute
and
yet
asking
what
i
am
know
that
long
ago
there
was
a
king
who
had
for
wives
a
thousand
queens
and
it
happened
that
one
day
he
went
with
his
wives
to
ramble
in
the
heart
of
a
forest
so
after
sporting
for
a
while
he
grew
tired
in
the
heat
of
the
day
and
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
then
all
his
queens
stole
away
and
left
him
lying
and
went
roaming
up
and
down
very
strange
creatures
in
that
wild
rough
wood
looking
like
living
flowers
of
every
hue
and
kind
that
had
somehow
or
other
got
free
from
their
roots
a
body
of
decoys
let
loose
by
love
the
hunter
to
lure
into
his
toils
every
man
that
should
behold
them
so
as
they
rambled
here
and
there
they
came
suddenly
on
an
old
ascetic
and
he
was
standing
still
half
buried
in
the
hills
of
ants
themselves
covered
over
by
his
long
white
hair
immersed
in
meditation
then
all
those
fair
women
went
up
and
stood
around
him
in
a
cluster
of
beautiful
curiosity
wondering
at
the
sight
of
him
and
asking
each
other
in
amazement
what
in
the
world
he
could
possibly
be
so
as
they
crowded
round
him
that
old
ascetic
emerged
from
his
trance
and
as
thou
art
doing
stood
silent
and
aghast
thinking
as
perhaps
thou
dost
thyself
that
indra
must
have
sent
him
all
the
nymphs
of
heaven
in
a
body
to
lure
him
from
the
path
of
liberation
for
o
thou
beautiful
suspicious
youth
what
is
there
so
terrible
about
me
as
to
cause
thee
to
shrink
from
my
approach
know
that
many
would
be
glad
to
be
wooed
as
was
that
old
ascetic
and
as
thou
art
now
lit
also
means
ix
and
then
aja
strove
to
awake
as
it
were
from
a
dream
and
he
shook
himself
as
if
to
shake
it
off
and
he
said
to
himself
i
feel
that
i
am
falling
as
it
were
a
victim
to
the
spell
of
this
passionate
and
subtle
beauty
and
now
unless
i
stiffen
and
steel
myself
against
her
i
shall
undoubtedly
be
bewitched
and
beguiled
beyond
the
possibility
of
escape
and
he
summoned
his
resolution
and
said
with
a
semblance
of
composure
fair
one
thou
dost
thyself
no
injustice
in
comparing
thyself
alone
to
a
thousand
queens
for
thou
art
a
very
incarnation
of
all
the
bewildering
fascination
of
thy
sex
and
yet
potent
as
they
are
thy
charms
are
wasted
and
resemble
blunted
arrows
when
directed
against
me
for
as
i
have
already
told
thee
i
am
pledged
to
another
and
proof
against
thy
spell
as
doubtless
was
thy
old
ascetic
against
that
bevy
of
straying
queens
and
then
natabhrúkutí
smiled
and
she
shook
at
him
her
finger
as
she
answered
rash
boy
beware
be
not
too
sure
of
the
adamantine
quality
of
thy
resistance
nor
even
of
thy
wisdom
in
resisting
me
at
all
and
beware
of
provoking
the
indignation
of
slighted
love
who
may
make
of
thee
a
signal
example
of
his
vengeance
take
care
lest
annoyed
with
thy
obstinacy
in
rejecting
what
he
offers
thee
for
nothing
he
should
deprive
thee
even
of
that
other
beauty
on
whose
account
alone
it
is
that
i
am
held
by
thee
so
cheap
poor
youth
but
that
my
lips
are
tied
i
could
enlighten
thee
art
thou
who
art
so
ready
lightly
to
disdain
me
art
thou
i
say
so
sure
so
very
sure
that
thou
art
thyself
the
only
lover
of
this
much
married
beauty
whom
thou
sawest
as
thou
sayest
for
the
very
first
time
in
thy
life
art
thou
so
sure
so
very
sure
that
she
is
not
deceiving
thee
and
that
thou
art
not
merely
the
last
of
the
many
lovers
whom
she
toys
with
for
a
moment
and
then
carelessly
casts
away
art
thou
so
very
certain
that
thou
hast
never
had
a
predecessor
and
aja
started
in
spite
of
himself
for
the
word
recalled
to
him
the
manner
of
the
old
king
and
natabhrúkutí
saw
it
and
she
looked
at
him
as
it
were
with
compassion
and
said
alas
unhappy
boy
thou
seest
that
in
thy
youth
and
inexperience
such
an
idea
had
not
occurred
to
thee
little
art
thou
qualified
to
cope
with
a
woman
guile
then
said
aja
fiercely
in
wrath
both
with
himself
and
her
it
is
false
and
she
is
true
but
natabhrúkutí
answered
very
gently
be
not
angry
for
i
do
not
question
that
she
loves
thee
i
do
not
even
doubt
it
for
if
she
did
not
she
would
be
a
fool
but
listen
and
learn
what
thou
dost
not
seem
to
know
that
love
is
a
master
knave
aye
by
far
the
greatest
master
of
deceit
in
the
three
great
worlds
and
woman
is
his
aptest
pupil
and
every
woman
living
were
she
even
as
simple
as
thyself
becomes
as
soon
as
she
falls
under
the
influence
of
love
a
very
incarnation
of
policy
and
craft
and
wiles
i
tell
thee
foolish
boy
that
she
that
loves
in
earnest
were
she
good
as
gold
pure
as
snow
and
flawless
as
a
diamond
would
plunge
to
gain
her
object
to
the
very
lowest
bottom
of
the
ocean
of
deceit
and
what
is
her
object
but
the
esteem
of
her
lover
dost
thou
think
she
would
balance
for
an
instant
between
her
lover
and
the
ruin
of
the
world
between
his
good
opinion
and
a
lie
dost
thou
think
she
would
forfeit
thy
esteem
when
to
deceive
thee
would
preserve
it
i
tell
thee
in
such
a
dilemma
she
would
lie
till
the
very
sun
at
noon
hid
his
face
out
of
shame
know
that
long
ago
there
lived
at
wáránasi
an
independent
lady
of
beauty
so
extraordinary
that
swarms
of
lovers
used
to
buzz
continually
about
her
like
great
black
bees
about
the
mango
blossom
in
the
spring
but
independent
though
she
was
she
was
so
fastidious
that
none
of
her
innumerable
lovers
ever
touched
her
heart
even
for
a
moment
and
hence
she
lived
like
a
lamp
at
midnight
surrounded
by
the
corpses
of
her
victims
who
fluttered
about
her
lustre
and
perished
in
its
flame
and
then
at
last
one
day
it
came
about
that
a
tall
young
rajpoot
almost
as
beautiful
as
thou
art
arrived
at
wáránasí
and
kasháyiní
for
that
was
her
name
saw
him
from
a
window
as
he
came
into
the
city
and
instantly
like
an
empty
pitcher
suddenly
plunged
into
the
ganges
she
was
filled
to
the
very
brim
by
the
inrush
of
love
sacred
nectar
and
she
said
to
herself
the
very
first
thing
that
he
will
hear
of
in
the
city
is
myself
and
like
everybody
else
he
will
come
immediately
to
see
me
and
that
very
moment
i
shall
abandon
the
body
out
of
shame
for
though
my
beauty
might
attract
him
yet
he
will
be
convinced
that
many
lovers
have
preceded
him
and
therefore
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
will
despise
me
and
this
would
be
worse
than
any
death
and
yet
without
him
my
birth
will
have
been
in
vain
therefore
i
must
devise
some
expedient
so
after
a
while
she
went
out
in
disguise
and
bought
for
a
large
sum
of
money
the
body
of
a
woman
of
her
own
age
and
size
who
had
died
that
very
day
and
bringing
that
body
home
secretly
at
night
she
dressed
it
in
her
own
clothes
and
burned
it
till
its
identity
was
obliterated
and
then
she
set
fire
to
her
house
and
left
it
by
a
back
door
and
went
away
abandoning
all
her
wealth
but
the
jewels
that
she
wore
for
the
sake
of
her
picture
in
the
air
and
at
that
very
moment
the
rajpoot
came
along
led
by
some
of
the
townspeople
to
visit
her
as
it
were
set
on
fire
by
the
very
description
of
her
beauty
and
he
looked
and
saw
the
flames
bursting
from
her
house
as
though
lit
by
himself
and
they
found
the
half
burned
body
in
the
ashes
and
immediately
all
the
lovers
of
kasháyiní
followed
her
through
the
fire
of
grief
to
the
other
world
but
the
rajpoot
managed
in
spite
of
disappointment
to
remain
alive
and
she
in
the
meantime
having
given
every
one
the
slip
found
a
false
ascetic
and
bribed
him
with
jewels
giving
him
instructions
without
letting
him
know
who
she
was
so
that
ascetic
went
and
struck
up
acquaintance
with
the
rajpoot
pretending
to
be
a
discoverer
of
treasure
and
he
performed
incantations
and
after
a
while
he
said
to
him
go
quickly
to
ujjayini
and
dig
in
the
corner
of
the
burning
ground
outside
the
city
on
the
very
last
day
of
the
dark
half
of
the
month
of
magha
and
thou
shalt
find
a
treasure
take
it
for
what
is
the
use
of
treasure
to
such
a
one
as
me
thereupon
that
rajpoot
having
nothing
else
to
do
went
and
kasháyiní
having
first
made
sure
that
the
bait
had
taken
went
herself
and
got
there
before
him
so
when
that
rajpoot
arrived
he
dug
exactly
as
he
was
told
and
found
absolutely
nothing
and
cursing
his
destiny
he
went
out
of
the
burning
ground
in
the
early
morning
and
as
he
went
along
suddenly
he
saw
kasháyiní
who
was
waiting
for
him
sitting
weeping
by
the
wayside
under
a
great
tree
beautifully
dressed
blazing
with
jewels
and
adorned
with
saffron
and
antimony
betel
indigo
and
spangles
flowers
minium
and
henna
bangles
on
ankle
and
comb
in
her
hair
and
she
said
to
that
rajpoot
who
was
as
utterly
astounded
by
the
sight
of
her
as
if
she
had
been
water
in
the
desert
o
son
of
a
king
succour
one
who
is
utterly
without
resource
and
when
he
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
she
said
i
was
the
only
wife
of
a
very
rich
merchant
and
as
we
travelled
from
the
south
suddenly
we
were
set
upon
by
a
band
of
thags
and
after
killing
every
one
but
me
they
all
went
to
sleep
thinking
me
secure
but
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
went
a
little
way
and
hid
myself
in
a
hollow
tree
and
in
the
morning
those
villains
after
hunting
for
me
in
vain
all
went
away
fearing
a
pursuit
and
i
came
out
of
the
tree
trembling
and
reached
this
road
and
now
i
am
alone
in
the
world
then
said
the
rajpoot
to
himself
ha
so
after
all
i
have
found
my
treasure
and
that
excellent
ascetic
was
a
true
prophet
and
he
said
o
lady
i
am
of
good
family
and
now
if
thou
wilt
have
me
for
a
husband
i
will
supply
the
loss
of
thy
merchant
and
all
the
rest
of
thy
relations
and
she
feigned
reluctance
but
after
a
while
she
dried
her
tears
and
consented
but
that
rajpoot
almost
went
out
of
his
mind
so
great
was
his
delight
and
one
day
he
told
her
of
wáránasí
and
the
burning
of
kasháyiní
and
she
looked
at
him
with
laughing
eyes
and
said
o
my
husband
i
will
make
up
to
thee
for
the
loss
of
kasháyiní
for
i
am
just
as
beautiful
as
she
in
all
oriental
stories
statements
are
proved
not
by
aristotelian
syllogism
but
by
instances
and
we
are
reminded
of
the
opinion
of
the
artful
retz
that
never
persuades
anybody
but
anybody
can
insinuate
benáres
the
lady
in
question
was
one
of
those
hindoo
aspasias
of
whom
many
similar
stories
are
told
which
we
might
translate
aromatic
it
includes
the
ideas
of
and
or
as
we
say
castle
in
the
air
a
regular
trade
in
medieval
india
everything
in
this
story
is
exactly
in
harmony
with
the
manners
of
medieval
india
the
thags
often
preserved
a
woman
for
her
beauty
when
they
murdered
every
one
else
x
and
as
natabhrúkutí
ended
she
leaned
forward
and
gazed
at
aja
with
soft
seductive
eyes
till
he
blushed
and
wavered
before
her
like
the
flame
of
a
candle
in
a
wind
for
her
beauty
bewildered
him
and
her
cunning
story
planted
as
if
against
his
will
the
seed
of
suspicion
in
his
mind
and
in
spite
of
himself
he
said
to
himself
what
if
it
were
as
she
says
and
my
wife
like
another
kasháyiní
were
concealing
from
me
something
that
she
shrank
from
avowing
lest
i
should
think
the
worse
of
her
and
he
turned
pale
at
the
thought
that
any
other
lover
should
even
a
very
little
have
occupied
her
heart
before
him
and
he
stood
silent
and
confused
striving
to
expel
from
his
mind
the
doubt
that
natabhrúkutí
had
raised
in
it
saying
to
himself
can
i
really
be
only
the
last
of
many
lovers
and
all
the
while
natabhrúkutí
watched
him
devouring
him
as
it
were
with
her
eyes
and
at
last
she
said
again
sweet
boy
thou
art
too
young
and
too
honest
to
cope
with
women
who
were
framed
by
the
creator
to
deceive
but
aja
said
angrily
thou
art
thyself
a
woman
seeking
at
this
very
moment
to
deceive
me
and
as
for
thy
age
it
is
less
than
my
own
and
she
said
nay
nay
i
am
older
for
i
am
wiser
than
thyself
for
when
i
see
my
husband
i
remember
him
but
me
thou
hast
utterly
forgotten
thy
true
and
only
wife
ah
foolish
one
thou
hast
forgotten
and
thou
resemblest
one
who
casts
away
a
costly
jewel
for
the
sake
of
a
bit
of
glass
shining
only
in
the
sunlight
of
thy
ignorance
and
trodden
by
the
foot
of
every
passing
stranger
what
can
i
do
nothing
to
rouse
thy
recollection
look
at
me
well
look
hard
and
it
may
be
something
of
me
will
touch
as
it
were
a
chord
in
thy
soul
and
she
came
up
close
to
him
so
that
the
warmth
and
fragrance
of
her
beauty
enveloped
him
like
an
atmosphere
of
intoxication
and
she
joined
her
hands
looking
up
into
his
face
as
it
were
compelling
his
reluctant
admiration
by
her
humble
submission
to
his
will
and
she
said
hast
thou
hast
thou
indeed
forgotten
all
and
as
he
gazed
at
her
two
huge
drops
of
crystal
welled
into
her
eyes
and
hung
poised
before
they
fell
on
the
net
of
her
long
dark
lashes
and
she
said
thou
sayest
i
am
seeking
to
deceive
thee
i
love
thee
and
where
is
the
deception
is
it
not
rather
thou
that
art
the
deceiver
in
this
matter
is
it
any
fault
of
mine
if
another
has
stepped
in
to
defraud
me
of
thyself
or
am
i
to
be
blamed
if
thy
beauty
still
beguiles
me
as
it
did
long
ago
and
yet
dost
thou
accuse
me
as
if
i
were
a
criminal
o
blue
black
bee
what
is
this
behaviour
that
thou
seekest
as
it
were
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
poor
red
lotus
who
loves
thee
but
too
well
and
she
smiled
through
her
tears
and
exclaimed
ah
but
in
spite
of
thee
i
will
adore
thee
whether
thou
wilt
or
no
ha
and
i
will
compel
thee
to
remember
and
force
my
way
through
every
barrier
and
obstacle
till
i
reach
the
recollection
in
the
bottom
of
thy
heart
o
canst
thou
not
remember
the
days
of
long
ago
when
my
now
despised
beauty
was
a
joy
to
thee
and
my
hair
a
very
net
to
snare
thy
willing
soul
and
my
eyes
were
more
to
thee
than
any
diamonds
and
these
two
arms
were
thy
prison
and
thy
chain
and
this
agitated
bosom
was
thy
pillow
on
which
i
lulled
thee
to
slumber
with
the
music
of
this
very
voice
hast
thou
really
forgotten
the
nectar
of
my
kiss
hast
thou
actually
forgotten
thy
own
insatiable
thirst
ah
but
if
thou
hast
forgotten
i
have
not
and
the
innumerable
multitudes
of
thy
too
delicious
kisses
come
back
to
me
singing
in
my
memory
and
whispering
in
my
soul
like
the
lisping
of
the
sea
hark
dost
thou
not
hear
them
also
those
voices
of
a
former
birth
the
reader
should
remember
that
in
sanskrit
and
are
the
same
word
xi
and
as
aja
gazed
at
her
stunned
and
almost
overcome
by
the
pathos
of
her
irresistible
appeal
and
as
it
were
swept
from
his
feet
by
the
surge
of
her
passion
suddenly
she
seized
his
left
hand
with
her
right
and
stood
grasping
it
as
if
convulsively
with
the
other
hand
raised
and
bending
her
head
as
if
to
listen
and
he
listened
and
lo
there
sounded
in
his
ears
a
murmur
resembling
that
of
the
sea
mixed
with
faint
strains
of
music
and
echoes
of
indistinguishable
singing
voices
coming
as
it
were
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
a
shudder
ran
through
him
as
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
as
if
in
ecstasy
with
eyes
that
saw
nothing
murmuring
in
an
eager
voice
that
chanted
and
charmed
his
ear
like
the
rushing
of
a
stream
dost
thou
hear
the
voices
calling
thee
over
to
the
other
shore
for
the
sea
is
the
sea
of
separation
and
the
other
shore
is
our
former
birth
far
away
over
the
setting
sun
hides
the
red
land
of
our
old
sweet
love
and
i
can
take
thee
back
to
it
out
of
this
dim
and
dingy
wood
only
i
can
carry
thee
back
to
the
land
beyond
the
sunset
hill
where
love
is
lying
dead
over
the
sea
where
monsters
lurk
and
great
pearls
grow
in
sunless
deeps
i
can
carry
thee
back
again
to
the
land
of
long
ago
never
a
ship
with
a
silken
sail
could
rock
thee
over
across
the
waves
so
well
as
i
will
waft
thee
there
on
the
swell
of
this
soft
breast
never
a
breeze
from
the
sandal
hill
could
ferry
thee
over
a
silent
sea
so
gently
as
will
i
by
breathing
into
thy
raptured
ear
tales
of
thy
old
forgotten
past
with
fond
and
fragrant
lips
what
art
thou
still
oblivious
of
that
old
delicious
birth
dost
thou
never
behold
in
dreams
the
paradise
of
our
little
hut
and
slake
again
thy
raging
thirst
in
a
long
forbidden
kiss
does
she
never
come
back
to
thee
the
brahmani
girl
with
a
face
like
mine
with
lips
that
laughed
and
eyes
that
shone
and
a
mango
flower
in
her
hair
say
dost
thou
never
dream
of
her
and
she
shook
his
arm
with
frenzy
and
exclaimed
ha
wake
from
thy
magic
sleep
and
tear
away
the
curtain
that
hides
me
from
thy
blinded
soul
i
will
i
will
awake
thee
i
will
not
be
forgotten
and
all
at
once
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
and
she
reeled
as
though
about
to
fall
and
tottered
and
threw
herself
sobbing
hard
against
his
breast
and
while
she
spoke
aja
stood
like
one
pushed
to
the
very
edge
of
a
precipice
pale
as
death
and
breathing
hard
spellbound
and
then
at
last
when
she
threw
herself
upon
his
breast
again
a
shudder
ran
through
all
his
limbs
and
as
if
her
touch
had
shattered
to
pieces
the
last
fragment
of
his
resolution
he
caught
her
around
the
waist
with
the
one
arm
that
was
free
and
with
tears
in
his
own
eyes
he
stammered
as
if
in
the
extremity
of
desperation
hardly
knowing
what
he
said
alas
i
have
been
harsh
to
thee
o
lovely
browed
beauty
cease
to
weep
why
o
why
did
i
not
meet
thee
sooner
by
only
a
single
day
the
sanskrit
has
exactly
the
same
connotation
as
our
islands
of
the
blest
and
like
them
it
is
placed
in
the
setting
sun
xii
and
at
that
very
moment
he
heard
behind
him
a
deep
sigh
and
as
he
turned
wood
poppies
and
all
vanished
from
before
his
eyes
once
more
he
stood
on
the
city
wall
and
there
before
him
was
the
daughter
and
she
was
standing
in
the
doorway
through
which
he
had
come
upon
the
wall
leaning
against
the
open
door
and
paler
than
love
own
ashes
while
her
great
dark
eyes
were
frozen
as
it
were
to
ice
and
yet
lit
up
by
the
triple
fire
of
sorrow
and
reproach
and
fierce
disdain
and
she
looked
like
the
daughter
of
janaka
when
forsaken
by
the
lord
of
the
race
of
raghu
and
like
the
heavenly
urwashi
when
abandoned
by
pururawas
a
very
spirit
of
despair
carved
by
the
creator
into
a
stony
female
form
to
break
the
heart
of
the
three
worlds
and
as
if
the
very
sight
of
her
had
broken
the
spell
that
held
him
reason
and
recollection
suddenly
returned
to
aja
as
it
were
at
a
single
bound
and
he
woke
as
if
from
a
magic
sleep
and
on
the
instant
a
sword
ran
as
it
were
straight
into
his
heart
and
with
a
cry
he
flung
away
his
sobbing
burden
like
a
blade
of
grass
not
caring
where
it
fell
and
ran
towards
the
king
daughter
but
she
when
she
saw
him
coming
shrieked
and
started
and
exclaimed
away
touch
me
not
save
with
the
point
of
thy
sharp
true
sword
to
pierce
me
through
the
body
as
thy
perfidy
has
my
soul
then
aja
tossed
away
his
sword
with
a
shudder
over
the
edge
of
the
wall
and
he
seized
himself
by
the
head
with
both
hands
with
a
groan
like
the
roar
of
a
wounded
lion
and
he
exclaimed
ha
better
now
it
had
been
indeed
had
i
never
emerged
from
the
waste
of
sand
and
he
turned
fiercely
upon
natabhrúkutí
saying
this
is
thy
doing
thou
vile
enchantress
and
now
i
am
indeed
awake
but
even
as
he
spoke
the
words
died
away
upon
his
lips
and
he
stood
still
like
a
picture
on
a
wall
for
wonder
at
what
he
saw
before
him
for
natabhrúkutí
was
standing
still
exactly
where
he
left
her
bolt
upright
like
a
spear
fixed
in
the
earth
and
her
beauty
was
greater
than
ever
and
yet
such
that
as
he
saw
it
his
heart
stopped
in
his
breast
for
every
vestige
of
the
nectar
of
her
had
left
her
and
in
its
place
the
poison
of
immortal
hate
shone
in
her
cold
and
evil
eyes
which
were
fastened
as
if
with
a
mixture
of
pain
and
pleasure
with
a
glittering
and
fiendish
stare
upon
the
daughter
and
as
he
watched
them
cold
ran
in
aja
veins
for
her
eyes
shook
and
changed
colour
and
a
horrible
smile
played
on
her
blue
and
twitching
lips
and
she
looked
thin
for
her
two
arms
hung
down
tight
against
her
sides
and
her
fingers
opened
and
shut
slowly
as
if
of
their
own
accord
and
after
a
while
she
spoke
and
she
turned
to
aja
and
said
in
a
voice
that
resembled
a
hiss
fool
thou
wouldst
not
take
the
blue
flower
i
offered
thee
though
its
fragrance
could
not
have
been
matched
by
anything
in
the
three
worlds
now
then
i
will
take
another
way
so
as
he
watched
her
she
was
gone
and
he
saw
before
him
nothing
but
the
empty
city
wall
and
as
he
looked
again
not
crediting
the
testimony
of
his
own
eyes
he
heard
a
sharp
cry
from
the
king
daughter
and
he
turned
and
saw
yashowatí
sinking
to
the
ground
and
at
that
very
moment
natabhrúkutí
stood
again
before
him
and
she
looked
at
him
with
strange
eyes
and
said
slowly
go
now
and
enjoy
thy
wife
but
i
must
give
thee
just
one
kiss
before
i
go
and
as
aja
looked
into
her
eyes
suddenly
like
a
flash
of
lightning
he
understood
and
he
struck
his
hand
upon
his
brow
exclaiming
ha
now
now
i
understand
too
late
thou
art
that
very
she
that
was
jealous
of
the
king
daughter
beauty
and
ruined
her
out
of
spite
and
i
have
been
befooled
by
thee
and
failed
to
stand
the
test
and
he
ground
his
teeth
with
rage
that
swept
through
him
like
a
storm
and
he
said
to
himself
alas
i
threw
away
my
sword
no
matter
now
then
as
she
said
herself
i
will
take
another
way
and
he
looked
at
her
as
she
stood
waiting
and
he
held
out
his
arms
saying
come
then
and
as
she
put
her
face
close
to
his
own
he
caught
her
by
her
slender
throat
with
both
hands
in
a
grip
like
that
of
death
and
then
lo
she
was
gone
again
but
in
her
place
he
held
in
his
grasp
a
huge
yellow
snake
which
struck
him
as
he
clutched
it
hard
once
and
twice
upon
the
lips
a
fatal
kiss
and
then
little
by
little
the
night
gradually
came
to
an
end
and
the
sun
rose
up
out
of
his
home
in
the
eastern
mountain
and
began
rapidly
to
climb
into
the
sky
and
all
at
once
there
arose
a
great
hubbub
and
an
outcry
in
the
king
palace
and
the
women
ran
hither
and
thither
wailing
and
screaming
and
crying
out
haha
haha
the
daughter
of
the
king
is
gone
and
they
hunted
in
all
directions
but
could
not
find
her
anywhere
and
they
went
and
told
the
king
but
he
when
he
heard
it
came
running
just
as
he
was
in
his
night
clothes
and
hurried
about
with
all
the
women
looking
into
every
corner
and
finding
nothing
so
after
turning
the
palace
upside
down
he
stopped
short
and
he
said
what
if
she
should
have
followed
her
lover
up
on
to
the
city
wall
and
shared
his
fate
for
beyond
a
doubt
like
all
his
predecessors
he
has
vanished
never
to
return
then
they
all
went
up
the
winding
stair
the
king
going
first
and
he
stepped
out
on
to
the
wall
and
instantly
with
a
piercing
cry
he
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
mortal
swoon
then
terror
seized
on
all
those
women
and
they
stood
exactly
where
they
were
looking
at
each
other
with
pale
faces
not
daring
to
advance
but
at
last
after
a
long
while
supporting
each
the
other
they
pushed
forward
and
looked
out
and
they
saw
the
king
body
lying
on
that
of
his
daughter
and
a
little
further
off
aja
lying
upon
his
face
then
they
went
out
and
took
up
those
three
bodies
and
carried
them
in
and
examined
them
and
after
a
while
they
said
doubtless
the
heart
of
the
old
king
broke
when
he
saw
his
daughter
lying
dead
but
as
for
the
other
two
one
snake
has
evidently
bitten
both
and
yet
this
is
a
wonderful
thing
for
she
has
been
bitten
on
the
foot
but
her
lover
upon
the
lips
what
then
was
he
trying
to
kiss
the
snake
that
it
should
bite
him
upon
the
lips
for
how
could
even
the
biggest
snake
