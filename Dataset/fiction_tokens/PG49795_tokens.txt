this

a

and
great
spaces
of
the

of

with
a
population
that
could

a

a
land
of

a
land
of
little

great
harbors
of
rich

lovely
lakes
of
overflowing
rivers
and
oversurging
tides
that
with
all
their

alluvial
mud
a

france

might
well

if

of

flocking
into
this

which
thus
became

colony
of
scots
themselves
flowed
in
from
auld

and
the
german
came
to

himself
in

adventurers

with

in

with

down
went

and

their
stumps
alone

crash

the

grew
warier
the
astonished
musquash
vanished
in
eddying
circles
bridges
began
to
span
the
rivers
where
the
beaver
built
its
dams
in
happy
unconsciousness
of
the
tall
cylinder
that
was
about
to
crown
civilization
the
caribou
and
the
silver
fox
pressed
inland
to
save
their
skins
the
snare
was
set
in
the
and
the
crack
of
the
musket
followed
the
ring
of
the
axe
the
mackerel
and
the
herring
sought
destruction
in
shoals
and
the
seines
brimmed
over
with
salmon
and
alewives
and
gaspereux
the
wild
land
that
had
bloomed
with
and
violets
was
tamed
with
crops
and
plump
sheep
and
fat
oxen
pastured
where
the
wild
strawberry
vine
had
trailed
or
the
had
croaked
under
the
alders
a
sturdy
ingenious
race
the
fathers
of
the
new
settlement
loving
work
almost
as
much
as
they
feared
god
turning
their
hand
to
anything
and
opening
it
wide
to
the
stranger
they
raised
their
own
houses
and
fashioned
their
own
tools
and
shod
their
own
horses
and
later
built
their
own
vessels
and
even
sailed
them
to
the
great
markets
laden
with
the
produce
of
their
own
fields
and
the
timber
from
their
own
there
were
women
in
this
workaday
paradise
shapely
gentle
creatures
whose
hands
alone
were
rough
with
field
and
women
who
span
and
sang
when
the
winter
whistled
round
the
settlement
the
dramas
of
love
and
grief
began
to
play
themselves
out
where
the
raccoon
and
the
chickadee
had
fleeted
the
golden
hours
in
careless
living
children
came
to
make
the
rafters
habitable
and
death
to
sanctify
them
with
memories
the
air
grew
human
with
the
smoke
of
hearths
the
forest
with
legends
and
histories
and
as
houses
grew
into
homes
and
villages
into
townships
church
and
state
arose
where
only
faith
and
freedom
had
been
the
sons
and
heirs
of
the
fathers
did
not
always
cling
to
the
tradition
of
piety
and
perseverance
the
grew
apathetic
content
with
the
fatness
of
the
day
or
if
he
exerted
himself
it
was
too
often
to
best
a
neighbor
the
great
magnets
of
new
york
and
boston
drew
off
or
drew
back
all
that
was
iron
in
the
race
and
amid
these
homely
emotions
of
yeomen
amid
the
crude
pieties
or
impieties
of
homespun
souls
amid
this
sane
hearty
intercourse
with
realities
or
this
torpor
of
sluggish
spirits
was
born
ever
and
anon
a
gleam
of
fantasy
of
imagination
bizarre
transfiguring
touching
things
with
the
glamour
of
dream
blind
instincts
blinder
still
in
their
loneliness
yearned
towards
light
beautiful
emotions
stirred
in
dumb
souls
emotions
that
mayhap
turned
to
morbid
passion
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
woods
where
character
may
grow
crabbed
and
gnarled
as
well
as
sound
and
straight
for
whereas
to
most
of
these
human
creatures
begirt
by
the
glory
of
sea
and
forest
the
miracles
of
sunrise
and
sunset
were
only
the
familiar
indications
of
a
celestial
timepiece
and
the
starry
heaven
was
but
a
leaky
ceiling
in
their
earthly
habitation
there
was
here
and
there
an
eye
keen
to
note
the
play
of
light
and
shade
and
color
the
glint
of
wave
and
the
sparkle
of
and
the
spume
of
tossing
seas
the
gracious
fairness
of
cloud
and
bird
and
blossom
the
magic
of
sunlit
sails
in
the
offing
the
witchery
of
white
winters
and
all
the
changing
wonder
of
the
woods
a
soul
with
scanty
at
best
yet
haply
absorbing
nature
to
give
it
back
one
day
as
art
ah
but
to
see
the
world
with
other
eyes
than
fellows
yet
express
the
vision
of
race
its
subconscious
sense
of
beauty
is
not
all
a
covetable
dower
the
islands
of
acadia
are
riddled
with
pits
where
men
have
burrowed
for
captain
treasure
and
found
nothing
but
holes
the
deeper
they
delved
the
deeper
holes
they
found
whoso
with
blood
and
tears
would
dig
art
out
of
his
soul
may
lavish
his
golden
prime
in
pursuit
of
emptiness
or
striking
treasure
find
only
fairy
gold
so
that
when
his
eye
is
purged
of
the
spell
of
morning
he
sees
his

is
full
of

matt
opened
his
eyes
vaguely
shaking
off
his
younger
frantic
clutch
the
frost
he
murmured
closing
his
eyes
again
to
sleep
since
the
sled
accident
that
had
crippled
him
for
life
billy
was
full
of
nervous
terrors
and
the
night
had
been
charged
with
mysterious
noises
within
the
lonely
wooden
house
and
beams
cracked
without
twigs
snapped
and
branches
crashed
at
times
billy
heard
reports
as
loud
as
one
of
these
shots
meant
the
bursting
of
the
on
the
bedroom
bench
matt
having
forgotten
to
empty
its
contents
which
had
expanded
into
ice
matt
curled
himself
up
more
comfortably
and
almost
covered
his
face
with
the
blanket
for
the
cold
in
the
stoveless
attic
was
acute
in
the
gray
the
rough
beams
and
the
quilts
glistened
with
frozen
breaths
the
little
square
were
thickly
frosted
and
below
the
crumbling
rime
was
a
thin
layer
of
ice
left
from
the
day
before
solid
up
to
the
sashes
and
leaving
no
infinitesimal
dot
of
clear
glass
for
there
was
nothing
to
thaw
it
except
such
heat
as
might
radiate
through
the
bricks
of
the
square
chimney
that
came
all
the
way
from
the
cellar
through
the
centre
of
the
flooring
to
pop
its
head
through
the
shingled
roof
billy
was
nudging

listened

he
said
reassuringly
and
snuggled
up
again
between
the
blankets
the
winter
though
yet
young
had
already
achieved
a
reputation
blustrous
north
winds
had
driven
inland
felling
the
trees
like
lumbermen
in
the
annapolis
basin
myriads
of
herrings
surprised
by
jack
frost
before
their
migratory
instinct
awoke
had
been
found
frozen
in
the
weirs
and
the
great
salt
tides
overflowing
the
high
dykes
had
been
congealed
into
a
chocolate
sea
that
when
the
liquid
water
beneath
ran
back
through
the
sluices
lay
solid
on
the
marshes
by
the
shores
of
the
basin
of
minas
flapped
ghostlike
over
amber
whose
under
the
kiss
of
the
sun
blushed
like
blood
snow
had
fallen
heavily
whitening
the
hemlocks
and
through
the
shapeless
landscape
oxen
had
toiled
to
clear
the
blurred
roads
bordered
by
till
the
three
familiar
tracks
of
hoofs
and
came
in
sight
again
the
stage
to
truro
ploughed
its
way
along
with
only
dead
freight
on
its
roof
and
a
furred
animal
or
two
vaguely
human
shivering
inside
sometimes
the
mail
had
to
travel
by
horse
and
sometimes
it
altogether
disappointed
billy
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
excitement
of
its
passage
for
the
stage
road
ran
by
the
small
clearing
in
the
centre
of
which
their
house
and
barn
had
been
built
a
primitive
gabled
house
like
a
ark
ugliness
unadorned
and
a
cheap
log
barn
of
the
type
with
its
cracks
corked
with
moss
and
a
roof
of
slabs
jack
frost
might
stop
the
mail
but
he
could
not
stop
the
gayeties
of
the
season
and
and
and
infares
and
baptist
had
been
as
frequent
as
ever
and
part
of
enjoyment
of
his
couch
was
a
delicious
sense
of
oversleeping
himself
legitimately
for
even
his
mother
could
hardly
expect
him
to
build
the
fire
at
five
when
he
had
only
returned
from
deacon
at
two
he
saw
himself
coasting
down
the
white
slopes
in
his
watching
the
wavering
radiance
of
the
northern
lights
that
paled
the
moon
and
the
stars
and
wishing
his
mother
would
not
spoil
the
of
the
pleasure
and
the
poetic
silence
of
the
woods
by
grumbling
about
his
sister
harriet
who
had
deserted
them
for
an
earlier
escort
home
he
felt
himself
well
rewarded
for
his
labor
in
loading
marsh
mud
for
the
of
deacon
fields
and
a
sudden
remembrance
of
how
his
mother
had
been
rewarded
for
helping
hailey
to
prepare
the
feast
made
him
nudge
billy
in
his
turn
up
billy
brought
back
a
basket
goodies
doughnuts
worst
said
billy
matt
mumbled
impatiently
and
redirected
his
thoughts
to
the
the
images
of
the
night
swept
before
him
with
almost
the
vividness
of
actuality
he
lost
himself
in
memories
as
though
they
were
realities
and
every
now
and
then
a
dash
of
sleep
streaked
these
waking
visions
with
the
fantasy
of
dream
how
the
fiddle
shrieks
runs
the
reminiscence
ole
jupe
do
his
to
home
the
pesky
nigger
all
for
the
reel
the
are

made

looks

great
with
thet
white
frock
the
pink
sash
a
fact
hooray
devil
among
the
tailors
la
lalla
lalla
lalla
lalla
he
hears
the
big
winter
thwack
the
keep
it
up
whoop
faster
ever
faster
oh
the
joy
of
life
now
he
is
swinging
ruth
in
his
arms
oh
the
the
long
rows
of
candles
pinned
by
forks
to
the
barn
walls
are
guttering
in
the
wind
of
the
movement
the
horses
tied
to
their
mangers
neigh
in
excitement
from
between
their
stanchions
the
cows
gaze
at
the
dancers
perking
their
naïve
noses
and
tranquilly
chewing
the
cud
a
bat
thawed
out
of
his
winter
nap
by
the
heat
of
the
temporary
stove
flutters
drowsily
about
the
candles
and
the
odors
of
the
stable
and
of
the
packed
hay
mingle
with
the
scents
of
the
exhaustive
eye
though
never
long
off
pretty
face
takes
in
even
the
grains
of
wheat
that
gild
many
a
tousled
head
of
swain
or
lass
as
the
shaking
of
the
beams
dislodges
the
unthreshed
kernels
in
the
mow
under
the
eaves
and
keener
even
than
the
eye
of
his
collie
sprat
notes
the
mice
that
dart
from
their
holes
to
seize
the
fallen
drops
of
tallow
but
perhaps
sprat
is
only
lazy
for
he
will
not
vacate
his
uncomfortable
snuggery
under
the
stove
though
he
has
to
shift
his
carcass
incessantly
to
escape
the
jets
of
constantly
squirted
in
his
direction
it
serves
him
right
thinks
his
young
master
for
persisting
in
coming
though
for
the
matter
of
that
the
creature
having
superintended
the
has
more
right
to
be
present
than
bully
preep
why
sister
harriet
lets
him
dance
with
her
so
the
panorama
of
his
thought
proceeds
kin
she
see
in
the
skunk
fur
sakes
i
told
her
the
way
he
me
when
he
was
boss
the
school
and
i
was
a
teeny
shaver
but
she
seem
to
care

snap

queer
critters
a
fact

used
to
put
a
chip
on
my
shoulder
egg
the
fellers
on
to
flick
it
off
but
gosh
i
hit
him
a
lick
when

black
eye
a
fact
though
he
me
two
mother

a
me
one
more
apiece
but
there
no
more
left
i
took
it
out
in
picters
though
i
guess
my
ole

when
he
discovered

the
of
every
jest

the
little

was
nestling
close
up
to
him
with
the
same
air
as
when
they
rode
that
flying
sled
together
this
time
it
was
impossible

than

on
with
for
a
moment
or
two
matt
listened
in
silent
torture
the
frequency
of
these
episodes
had
made
him
resigned
but
not
callous
now
sobs
were
added
to
the
horror
of
the
altercation
and
matt
fancied
he
heard
a
sound
of
scuffling
he
jumped
out
of
bed
in
an
agony
of
alarm
he
pulled
on
his
trousers
caught
up
his
coat
and
slipped
it
on
as
he
flew
barefoot
down
the
rough
wooden
stairs
with
his
woollen
braces
dangling
behind
him
in
the
narrow
icy
passage
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
in
the
bleak
light
from
the
row
of
little
crusted
panes
on
either
side
of
the
door
he
found
his
mother
and
sister
their
shoes
in
snow
that
had
drifted
in
under
the
door
strang
was
fully
dressed
in
her
costume
which
at
that
period
included
a
crinoline
she
wore
an
astrakhan
sacque
reaching
to
the
knees
and
a
small
plentifully
beribboned
blooming
with
artificial
flowers
within
and
without
and
tied
under
the
chin
by
broad
black
watered
bands
round
her
neck
was
a
fringed
afghan
or
muffler
she
was
a
tall
dark
woman
with
blazing
black
eyes
and
handsome
features
of
a
somewhat
gallic
cast
for
she
came
of
old
huguenot
stock
she
stood
now
drawing
on
her
mittens
in
terrible
silence
her
bosom
heaving
her
nostrils
quivering
harriet
was
nearer
the
door
flushed
and
panting
and
sobbing
a
auburn
blonde
of
sixteen
her
hair
dishevelled
her
bodice
unhooked
a
strange
contrast
to
the
primness
you
she
said
tremulously
as
she
barred
her
way
with
her
body
to
drownd
myself
answered
her
mother
carefully
smoothing
out
her
right
mitten
mother
broke
in
matt
go
out
he
brushed
past
the
pair
and
placed
himself
with
his
back
to
the
door
his
heart
beating
painfully
his
mad
threats
were
familiar
enough
yet
they
never
ceased
to
terrify
some
day
she
might
really
do
something
desperate
who
knew
to
drownd
myself
repeated
strang
carefully
winding
the
muffler
round
her
head
she
made
a
step
towards
the
door
sweeping
the
limp
harriet
roughly
behind
her
get

said
firmly

her

fiercely
upon

while
her
eyes
spat

young
and
wholesome

the
boy
squaring
his
shoulders
firmly
against
the
door
kin
you
drownd
yourself
the
froze
the
he
could
think
of
no
other
argument
for
the
moment
and
he
had
an
incongruous
vision
of
her
sliding
down
to
the
river
on
her
stomach
as
the
boys
often
did
down
the
steep
slopes
of
greasy
mud
or
sinking
into
a
like
an
errant
horse
illustration
placed
himself
with
his
back
to
the
he
added
wait
on
the
fur
the
merciful
she
fastened
her
firmly
river
is
full
of
ice
he
urged
will
be
room
fur

she
answered
then
with
a
sudden
exclamation
of
dismay
god
got
no
shoes
and
socks
on
ketch
your
death
go
replied
matt
becoming
conscious
for
the
first
time
of
a
cold
wave
creeping
up
his
spinal
marrow
ketch
my
death
then
and
he
sneezed
vehemently
on
your
shoes
socks
you
wretched
boy
you
know
what
a
bother
i
hed
with
you
last
he
shook
his
head
conscious
of
a
trump
card
hear
me
put
on
your
shoes
and
socks
off
your
bonnet
sacque
retorted
matt
clinching
his
fists
on
your
shoes
socks
repeated
his
mother
off
your
bonnet
sacque
put
on
my
shoes
they
stood
glaring
defiance
at
each
other
like
a
pair
of
duellists
their
breaths
rising
in
the
frosty
air
like
the
smoke
of
pistols
these
two
grotesque
figures
in
the
gray
light
of
the
bleak
passage
the
tall
fierce
brunette
in
her
flowery
bonnet
and
astrakhan
sacque
and
the
small
shivering
sneezing
boy
in
his
patched
homespun
coat
with
his
trailing
braces
and
bare
feet
they
heard
teeth
chatter
in
the
silence
back
to
bed
you
young
varmint
said
matt
suddenly
catching
sight
of
white
face
and
gray
on
the
landing
above
ketch
your
there
was
a
scurrying
sound
from
above
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
other
little
figures
matt
and
his
mother
still
confronted
each
other
warily
and
then
the
situation
was
broken
up
by
the
near
approach
of
they
stopped
slowly
mingling
their
jangling
with
the
creak
of
runners
sliding
over
frosty
snow
then
the
scrunch
of
heavy
boots
travelled
across
the
clearing
harriet
flushed
in
modest
alarm
and
fled
strang
hastily
retreated
into
the
kitchen
and
for
one
brief
moment
matt
breathed
freely
till
hearing
the
click
of
the
he
scented
gunpowder
he
dashed
towards
the
door
and
pressed
the
but
it
was
fastened
from
within
he
gasped
gun
the
gun
he
beat
at
the
door
his
imagination
seeing
through
it
his
loaded
gun
was
resting
on
the
wooden
hooks
fastened
to
the
beam
in
the
ceiling
he
heard
his
mother
mount
a
chair
he
tried
to
break
open
the
door
but
could
not
the
chances
of
getting
round
by
the
back
way
flashed
into
his
mind
only
to
be
dismissed
as
quickly
there
was
no
time
in
breathless
agony
he
waited
the
report
of
the
gun
crash
a
strange
unexpected
sound
smote
his
ears
he
heard
the
thud
of
his
body
striking
the
floor
she
had
stabbed
herself
then
instead
half
mad
with
excitement
and
terror
he
backed
to
the
end
of
the
passage
took
a
running
leap
and
dashed
with
his
mightiest
momentum
against
the
frail
battened
door
off
flew
the
catch
open
flew
the
door
with
matt
in
pursuit
and
it
was
all
the
boy
could
do
to
avoid
tumbling
over
his
mother
who
sat
on
the
floor
among
the
ruins
of
a
chair
rubbing
her
shins
her
bonnet
slightly
disarranged
and
the
gun
still
loaded
demurely
on
its
perch
what
had
happened
was
obvious
some
of
the
little
strang
mice
taking
advantage
of
the
absence
at
the
frolic
had
had
a
frolic
on
their
own
account
turning
the
chair
into
a
sled
and
binding
up
its
leg
to
deceive
the
maternal
eye
it
might
have
supported
a
sitter
under
feet
it
had
collapsed
ere
her
hand
could
grasp
the
gun
pesky
young
varmints
she
exclaimed
full
of
this
new
grievance
might
hev
crippled
me
fur
life
always
i
keep
two
sticks
together
to
make
a
body
throw
up
the
the
sound
of
the
of
a
whip
battering
the
brought
her
to
her
feet
with
a
bound
she
began
dusting
herself
hastily
with
her
hand
you
at
she
inquired
you
go
unbar
the
door
there
like
a
stuck
pig
matt
knew
the
symptoms
of
volcanic
extinction
without
further
parley
he
ran
to
the
door
and
took
down
the
beechen
bar
the
visitor
was
hey
who
drove
the
mail
the
deacon
came
in
powdered
as
from
his
own
and
added
the
snow
of
his
to
the
drift
in
the
hall
there
were
mittens
on
his
hands
on
his
cap
tied
under
the
chin
a
black
muffler
hoary
with
frost
from
his
breath
round
his
neck
and
mouth
and
an
outer
coat
of
swathing
his
body
down
to
his
ankles
so
that
all
that
was
visible
of
him
was
a
little
inner
circle
of
red
face
with
frosted
eyebrows
strang
stood
ready
in
the
hall
with
a
genial
smile
and
matt
his
heart
grown
lighter
returned
to
the
kitchen
extracted
the
family
from
under
the
stove
where
it
had
been
placed
to
thaw
and
putting
on
his
own
he
set
about
shaving
whittlings
and
collecting
kindlings
to
build
the
fire
we
are
again
hey
cried
the
deacon
as
heartily
as
his
perpetual
colossal
quid
would
permit
tell
is
it
really
you
replied
strang
with
her
pleasant
smile
dooty
is
dooty
i
allus
thinks
he
said
spitting
into
the
and
flicking
the
snow
over
the
with
his
whip
deacon
hand
finds
to
do
he
does
a
fact
it
seem
so
long
a
while
since
you
and
me
were
our
heels
in
the
sir
roger
nay
look
so
peaked
to
make
such
a
touse
about
you
air
a
baptist
hey
i
guess
you
kinder
allowed
deacon
hailey
would
be
late
with
the
mail
hey
but
es
spry
es
if
gone
to
bed
with
the
fowls
you
find
the
beat
of
among
the
young
fellers
nowadays
so
a
lazy
slinky
lot
and
es
for
their
dooty
to
their
country
or
their
neighbor
you
brought
me
a
letter
interrupted
strang
anxiously
guess
but
out
airly
allowed
walk
over
to
the
village
to
see
if
it
hed
but
it
the
one
you
she
faltered
guess
not
why
i
brought
it
myself
i
kinder
scented
it
was
special
and
so
i
reckoned
save
you
the
trouble
of
to
the
deacon
hailey
the
man
to
spare
himself
trouble
to
obleege
a
do
es
be
done
by
hey
the
deacon
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
pointing
the
moral
of
a
position
perhaps
his
sermonizing
tendency
was
due
to
his
habit
of
expounding
the
sunday
texts
at
a
weekly
meeting
or
perhaps
his
weekly
exposition
was
due
to
his
sermonizing
tendency
strang
extended
her
hand
for
the
letter
he
produced
it
slowly
apparently
from
up
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
a
wet
epistle
addressed
in
a
sprawling
hand
strang
turned
it
about
puzzled
from
uncle
matt
ejaculated
matt
appearing
suddenly
at
the
kitchen
door
got
uncle
matt
on
the
brain
said
strang
a
halifax
she
could
not
understand
it
her
own
family
rarely
wrote
to
her
and
there
was
no
hand
of
theirs
in
the
address
deacon
hailey
lingered
on
apparently
prepared
in
his
consideration
for
others
to
listen
to
the
contents
of
his
letter
sonny
he
said
to
matt
jest
turned
out
and
not
slicked
up
yet
when
i
was
your
age
i
hed
done
my
chores
afore
the
day
hed
begun
no
wonder
the
province
is
so
behindhand
hey
so
matt
murmured
pop
pop
pop
was
all
that
he
heard
so
that
ole
moral
exhortations
left
him
neither
a
better
nor
a
wiser
boy
strang
still
held
the
letter
in
her
hand
apparently
having
become
indifferent
to
it
ole
hey
did
not
know
she
was
waiting
for
him
to
go
so
that
she
might
put
on
her
spectacles
and
read
it
she
never
wore
her
spectacles
in
public
any
more
than
she
wore
her
nightcap
both
seemed
to
her
to
belong
to
the
privacies
of
the
inner
life
and
glasses
in
particular
made
an
old
woman
of
one
before
time
if
she
had
worn
out
her
eyes
with
and
tears
that
was
not
her
business
the
deacon
with
no
sign
of
impatience
elaborately
unbuttoned
his
outer
then
the
overcoat
beneath
that
and
the
coat
under
that
and
then
pulling
up
the
edge
of
his
cardigan
that
fitted
tightly
over
his
waistcoats
he
toilsomely
thrust
his
horny
paw
into
his
and
hauled
out
a
fig
of
then
he
slowly
produced
from
the
other
pocket
a
small
in
the
guise
of
a
and
proceeded
to
cut
the
tobacco
with
one
of
the
instruments
here
sonny
he
cried
deacon
wants
you
said
strang
matt
moved
forward
into
the
passage
wondering
ole
hey
solemnly
held
up
the
wedge
of
he
had
cut
and
when
eye
was
well
fixed
on
it
he
dislodged
the
old
from
his
cheek
with
contortions
of
the
mouth
and
blew
it
out
with
portentous
gravity
lastly
he
replaced
it
by
the
wedge
of
mouthed
and
moulded
the
new
quid
conscientiously
between
tongue
and
teeth
and
passed
the
ball
into
his
right
cheek
the
way
to
succeed
in
life
sonny
never
throw

the

slowly
and
rather
puzzled

at
this
moment
a
sudden
stampede
of
hoofs
and
a
mad
jangling
of
bells
were
heard
without

the
deacon
breathlessly
turned

and
fled
in

said
throwing
away
the
remaining
snowball
as
he
hastened
gleefully
inside
to
partake
of
the
contents
of
the
letter
he
found
his
mother
sitting
on
the
old
settle
in
the
kitchen
her
spectacled
face
gray
as
the
sand
on
the
floor
her
head
bowed
on
her
bosom
one
limp
hand
held
the
crumpled
letter
she
reminded
him
of
a
drooping
foxglove
the
room
had
a
heart
of
fire
now
the
stove
in
the
centre
glowed
rosily
with
brands
but
somehow
it
struck
a
colder
chill
to
blood
than
before
drownded
his
mother
breathed
never
know
billy
now
he
thought
with
a
gleam
of
relief
strang
began
to
wring
her
mittened
hands
silently
and
the
letter
fluttered
from
between
her
fingers
matt
made
a
dart
at
it
and
read
as
follows

through

he
springs
to

then
jumps
through

into

kicks
the

a

hastily
took
in

carefully
at
a
loss
what
to
say
to
the
image
of
grief
rocking
on
the

from

the
lowing
of

half
protestation
half
astonishment
at
the
unpunctuality
of

momentary
relief
in

with

shook
her
head
and
set
the
roses
on
her
bonnet
nodding
gayly
to
the
leaping

his

she
finished
herself
yet
with
her
father
dead
too
she
got
up
and

dropped
into
the

her

drew
for

took
her
mittened
hand
tenderly
in
hers
we
do
mother
yes
we
do
we
know
how
you
hev
slaved
and
as
she
spoke
a
panorama
of
the
slow
years
was
fleeting
through
the
minds
of
all
three
the
long
blank
weeks
uncolored
by
a
letter
the
fight
with
poverty
the
outbursts
of
temper
all
the
pathos
of
lonely
lives
tears
gathered
in
the
eyes
more
for
themselves
than
for
their
dead
father
who
for
the
moment
seemed
but
gone
on
a
longer
voyage
said

choking

sobs

a
harriet
gathered
herself
together
and
went
weeping
up
the
stairs
matt
followed
her
with
a
sudden
thought
he
ran
up
to
his
room
and
returned
carrying
a
square
sheet
of
rough
paper
his
mother
had
sunk
into
chair
he
lifted
up
her
head
and
showed
her
the
paper
she
shrieked
and
showered
passionate
kisses
on
the
sketch
of
a
sailor
a
figure
that
had
a
strange
touch
of
vitality
a
vivid
suggestion
of
brine
and
breeze
she
arrested
herself
suddenly
pesky
varmint
she
cried
this
is
what
become
the
of
the
big
bible

urged

matt
fur
she
rolled
up
the
drawing
fiercely
and
matt
placed
himself
apprehensively
between
it
and
the
stove
said
he
be
took
he
remonstrated
strang
sullenly
placed
the
paper
in
her
bosom
and
the
action
reminded
her
to
remove
her
bonnet
and
sacque
harriet
drooping
and
listless
descended
the
stairs
carrying
the
and
marshalling
the
other
little
ones
a
blinking
bewildered
group
of
cherubs
with
tousled
hair
and
tumbled
clothes
sprat
came
down
last
stretching
himself
sleepily
he
had
kept
the
same
late
hours
as
matt
and
returning
with
him
from
the
frolic
had
crept
under
his
bed
the
sight
of
the
children
moved
strang
to
fresh
weeping
she
almost
tore
the
baby
from
arms
never
saw
you
she
cried
hysterically
closing
the
wee
yawning
mouth
with
kisses
her
eyes
fell
on
billy
limping
towards
the
stove
where
the
others
were
already
clustered
he
never
saw
she
cried
to
him
as
she
adjusted
the
awed
infant
on
the
settle
it
would
hev
broke
his
heart
kneel
down
and
say
a
prayer
for
him
you
mischeevious
little
billy
thus
suddenly
apostrophized
paled
with
nervous
fright
his
big
gray
eyes
grew
moist
a
lump
rose
in
his
throat
but
he
knelt
down
with
the
rest
and
began
bravely
father
which
art
in
heaven
what
are
you
about
jerked
his
mother
for
the
boy
had
paused
suddenly
with
a
strange
light
in
his
eyes
never
knowed
what
it
meant
afore
he
said
simply
his
eye
caught
the
mystic
gleam
from
his
sign
a
sign
she
cried
ecstatically
as
she
sprang
up
and
clasped
the
little
cripple
passionately
to
her
heaving
bosom
chapter
ii
the
dead
man
makes
his
first
and
last
appearance
the
death
of
his
father
of
whom
he
had
seen
so
little
gave
matt
a
haunting
sense
of
the
unsubstantiality
of
things
what
that
strong
wiry
man
with
the
shrewd
face
and
the
great
tanned
hands
and
tattooed
arms
was
only
a
log
swirling
in
the
currents
of
unknown
waters
in
vain
he
strove
to
figure
him
as
a
nebulous
spirit
the
conception
would
not
stay
nay
the
incongruity
seemed
to
him
to
touch
blasphemy
his
father
belonged
to
the
earth
and
the
seas
had
no
kinship
with
clouds
how
well
he
remembered
the
day
nearly
three
years
ago
when
they
had
parted
forever
and
indeed
it
had
been
sufficiently
stamped
upon
his
memory
without
this
final
blow
it
is
a
day
of
burning
august
so
torrid
that
they
have
left
their
coats
on
the
beach
they
are
out
on
the
sand
flats
wading
for
salmon
among
the
giant
saucers
of
salt
water
the
miniature
lakes
left
by
the
tide
for
this
is
one
of
the
rare
spots
in
the
province
where
the
fish
may
be
taken
thus
what
fun
it
is
spearing
them
in
a
joyous
rivalry
that
makes
the
fishers
wellnigh
jab
each
toes
with
their
pitchforks
and
completely
tear
each
away
in
the
friendly
tussle
for
a
darting
monster
so
that
the
heat
blisters
their
arms
with
great
white
blobs
that
stand
out
against
the
brown
of
the
skin
and
the
ornamental
coloring
of
the
now
and
then
in
their
early
course
when
tiny
threads
of
water
spurt
from
holes
in
the
sand
they
pause
to
dig
up
the
delicate
clam
with
savory
anticipations
of
chowder
farther
and
farther
they
wander
till
their
backs
are
bowed
with
the
spoil
the
in
a
little
basket
the
scaly
fish
strung
together
by
a
small
rope
passing
through
their
gills
the
boy
carries
the
shad
and
the
man
the
heavier
salmon
at
last
as
they
are
turning
homeward
late
in
the
afternoon
matt
stands
still
suddenly
rapt
by
the
poetry
of
the
scene
the
shimmering
pools
the
stretch
of
brown
sand
strewn
with
the
background
of
red
crowned
with
scattered
yellow
farms
embosomed
in
sombre
green
spruces
and
brooding
over
all
the
windless
circle
of
the
horizon
its
cold
blue
veiled
and
warmed
and
softened
by
a
palpitating
luminous
diaphanous
haze
of
pale
amethyst
tinged
with
rose
he
knows
no
word
for
what
he
sees
he
only
feels
the
beauty
along
sonny
says
his
father
looking
back
but
the
boy
lingers
still
till
the
man
rejoins
him
puzzled
in
the
wind
he
asks
farmer
barn
on
fire
on
faar
says
the
boy
waving
his
pitchfork
comprehensively
his
dialect
differs
a
whit
from
his
in
his
little
corner
of
acadia
the
mixture
of
english
and
american
which
with
local
variations
of
lowland
and
highland
scotch
north
of
ireland
brogue
and
french
patois
loosely
constitutes
a
idiom
is
further
tinged
with
the
specific
peculiarities
that
spring
from
illiteracy

rusticity

bless
why
you
marry
a
scotchwoman
asked
matt
with
childish
irrelevance
your
fault
answers
david
with
a
expression
why
you
take
her
to
sea
with
you
nay
the
mother
has
no
stomach
for
it
nor
i
either
and
then
there
was
harriet
a
little
body
in
long
clothes
and
the
land
was
pretty
nigh
cleared
he
adds
with
a
suspicion
of
apology
in
his
accent
we
grow
to
pay
the
mortgage
if
i
shipped
why
am
i
like
uncle
he
used
to
be
allus
at
the
sky
not
to
find
out
whether
to
git
the
hay
in
mind
you
but
to
make
little
picturs
on
the
sly
in
the
on
sundays
and
at
last
he
sold
the
farm
and
went
to
london
to
make
heart
begins
to
throb
a
strange
new
sense
of
kinship
stirs
within
him
you
got
any
of
them
thar
picturs
he
inquires
eagerly
one
says
david
shaking
his
head
contemptuously
clouds
were
all
right
because
clouds
may
be
anything
but
when
he
came
to
cows
their
own
dams
know
and
as
for
his
ships
why
he
used
to
hoist
every
inch
canvas
in
a
i
trust
him
to
tattoo
a
but
he
had
a
power
of
industry
dear
old
matt
and
i
guess
larnt
better
now
for
when
i
writ
to
him
him
i
was
alive
and
to
get
spliced
he
writ
back
he
was
settled
in
london
in
the
pictur
line
and
money
at
it
and
to
heart
swells
that
one
can
actually
make
money
by
making
pictures
is
a
new
idea
he
has
never
imagined
that
money
can
be
made
so
easily
why
he
might
help
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
he
does
not
see
the
need
of
going
to
london
to
make
them
he
can
make
them
quite
well
here
in
his
odd
moments
and
one
day
he
will
send
them
all
to
this
wonderful
kinsman
of
his
and
ask
him
to
sell
them
five
hundred
at
sixpence
each
why
it
sounds
like
one
of
those
faëry
calculations
with
which
mctavit
sometimes
dazzles
the
he
wonders
vaguely
whether
pictures
are
equally
vendible
at
that
other
mighty
city
whence
his
mother
came
and
if
so
whether
he
may
not
perhaps
help
her
to
accomplish
the
dream
of
her
married
life
the
dream
of
going
back
there
got
the
same
name
as
me
he
cries
in
ecstasy
should
put
it
way
sonny
says
his
father
dryly
when
i
give
it
you
in
his
honor
i
it
make
you
take
arter
him
but
you
git
it
into
your
figurehead
that
to
london
jest
got
to
stay
right
here
and
look
arter
the
farm
for
mother
see
the
picturs
that
made
are
good
for
me
yes
dad
i
shall
allus
stay
on
here
answers
matt
readily
billy
who
allus
wants
to
be
a
pirate
silly
billy
he
says
his
father
silences
him
with
a
sudden
the
matter
he
asks
startled
guess
the
silly
billy
when
the
in
have
to
run
for
matt
gives
a
hasty
glance
to
the
left
then
takes
to
his
heels
straight
across
the
sands
in
pace
with
his
father
the
famous
of
the
bay
of
fundy
in
a
northerly
inlet
of
which
they
have
been
fishing
is
racing
towards
them
from
the
left
and
to
get
to
shore
they
must
shoot
straight
across
the
galloping
current
they
are
at
the
head
of
the
bay
where
the
tide
reaches
a
maximum
speed
of
ten
miles
an
hour
and
the
sailor
so
rarely
at
home
has
forgotten
its
idiosyncrasy
might
your
open
he
growls
wonder
never
been
drownded
shall
never
do
it
father
pants
matt
taking
no
notice
of
the
reproach
for
the
waves
are
already
lapping
the
rim
of
the
little
sand
island
cut
out
by
rivulets
on
which
they
find
themselves
and
the
pools
in
which
they
had
waded
are
filling
up
rapidly
away
jerks
the
father
and
matt
with
a
sigh
of
regret
unstrings
his
piscine
treasures
and
economically
putting
the
string
into
his
pocket
speeds
on
with
renewed
strength
but
the
sun
flares
mercilessly
through
the
fulgent
haze
and
when
they
reach
the
end
of
their
island
they
step
into
three
feet
of
water
with
the
safe
shore
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
david
strang
a
human
revolver
in
oaths
goes
off
in
a
favorite
sequence
of
shots
but
hangs
fire
in
the
middle
as
if
damped
me
the
mother
quote
scripture
he
says
grimly
instead
suppose
you
swim
sonny
he
adds
so
fur
nor
thet
says
matt
meekly
david
grunts
in
triumphant
anger
and
shifting
his
pitchfork
to
his
left
hand
he
grasps
matt
with
his
right
and
lifts
him
back
on
to
the
burning
sand
already
soddened
by
a
thin
frothy
then
us
your
fork
he
says
crossly
he
knocks
out
the
iron
prongs
of
both
the
pitchforks
ties
the
wooden
handles
securely
together
by
the
string
from
discarded
fish
and
fixes
the
apparatus
across
the
breast
and
under
his
arms
to
finish
the
job
easily
he
has
to
climb
back
on
the
sand
island
for
though
he
stands
in
a
little
eddy
it
is
impossible
to
keep
his
feet
against
the
fierce
swirl
of
the
waters
and
even
on
the
island
where
there
are
as
yet
only
a
few
inches
of
sea
the
less
sturdy
matt
is
almost
swept
away
to
the
right
by
the
mad
cavalry
charge
of
the
tide
on
his
left
flank
then
cries
david
about
time
we
were
home
to
supper
swim
ye
for
your
father
says
matt
not
going
to
carry
the
fish
on
your
back
carry
me
on
theirs
david
laughs
regaining
his
as
the
critical
moment
arrives
would
the
mother
think
if
we
came
home
without
a
prize
in
tow
avast
there
larn
you
how
get
out
of
on
my
and
with
a
chuckle
he
launches
himself
into
the
eddy
and
shoots
forward
with
a
vigorous
side
up
with
care
he
cries
cheerily
sonny
straight
and
in
a
moment
the
man
and
the
boy
are
swimming
hard
for
the
strip
of
shore
directly
opposite
the
sand
island
the
spot
where
they
had
left
their
coats
hours
before
but
neither
has
the
slightest
expectation
of
reaching
it
for
the
tide
is
sweeping
them
with
fearful
velocity
to
the
right
of
it
so
that
their
course
is
diagonal
and
if
they
make
land
at
all
it
will
be
very
far
from
their
original
david
keeps
the
boy
to
port
and
adjusts
his
stroke
to
his
after
a
while
feeling
himself
well
buoyed
up
by
the
handles
matt
breathes
more
easily
and
gradually
becomes
quite
happy
for
the
water
is
calm
on
the
surface
and
of
the
warmth
and
color
of
tepid
au
quite
a
refreshing
coolness
after
the
tropical
air
and
he
watches
with
pleasure
the
rosy
haze
deepening
into
purple
without
losing
its
transparency
they
pass
fighting
over
the
dead
fish
which
matt
left
behind
and
which
have
been
carried
ahead
of
him
in
their
unresisting
course
drifting
powerful
from
them
thar
coats
grumbles
david
be
a
tiresome
walk
back
if
it
for
them
we
could
cut
across
country
when
we
make
matt
strains
his
vision
to
the
left
but
sees
only
the
purple
outline
of
five
islands
and
in
the
far
background
the
faint
peaks
of
the
cobequid
hills
darned
exclaims
his
father
suddenly
them
thar
coats
to
meet
us
a
and
presently
sure
enough
matt
catches
sight
of
the
coats
hastening
along
near
the
shore
must
cut
off
afore
they
pass
by
cries
his
father
hilariously
sonny
spurt
a
race
them
and
begin
to
circle
low
over
their
heads
scenting
fish
but
he
pushes
steadily
on
animating
his
son
with
playful
racing
cries
oughter
back
the
coats
he
observes
backed
us
many
a
time
just
a
leetle
quicker
he
says
at
last
git
past
yonder
and
then
off
to
matt
kicks
out
more
lustily
then
his
heart
almost
stops
as
he
suddenly
sees
death
beneath
the
lovely
purple
haze
it
is
the
human
swimmers
who
are
in
danger
of
being
carried
off
to
truro
if
they
do
not
make
the
shore
earlier
than
for
matt
remembers
all
at
once
that
it
is
the
last
point
for
miles
the
shore
curving
deeply
inward
even
if
they
reach
the
point
in
time
they
will
be
thrown
back
by
the
centrifugal
swirl
they
must
touch
the
shore
earlier
to
get
in
safely
he
perceives
his
father
has
been
aware
of
the
danger
from
the
start
and
has
been
disguising
his
anxiety
under
the
pretext
of
racing
the
coats
he
feels
proud
of
this
strong
brave
man
the
cold
terror
passes
from
his
limbs
and
he
spurts
bravely
a
little
man
says
david
catch
yet
lucky
sandstone
yonder
sand
no
fear
sucked
now
it
is
the
shore
that
seems
racing
to
meet
them
the
red
reef
sticks
out
a
friendly
finger
and
in
another
five
minutes
they
are
perched
upon
it
like
gulliver
on
the
thumb
and
what
is
more
they
tie
with
their
coats
meeting
them
just
at
the
david
laughs
a
long
homeric
laugh
at
the
queerness
of
the
incident
quivering
like
a
dog
that
shakes
himself
after
a
swim
and
matt
smiles
too
thar
air
a
bit
off
their
feed
a
fact
chuckles
david
as
he
surveys
his
fish
and
then
the
two
cut
across
the
forest
drying
and
steaming
in
the
sun
the
elder
exhorting
the
younger
to
silence
and
hiding
the
prongless
pitchforks
in
the
before
they
enter
the
house
all
smiles
and
salmon
at
the
early
they
sit
in
dual
isolation
at
one
end
of
the
table
their
chairs
close
but
lo
strang
passing
the
hot
flapjacks
or
with
the
superfluous
perambulations
of
an
excitable
temperament
brushes
the
back
of
her
hand
against
shoulder
starts
pauses
and
brushes
it
with
her
palm
the
wet
she
cries
went
david
reminds
her
meekly
but
you
wade
on
your
heads
she
retorts
sorter
tumbled
matt
puts
in
anxious
to
exonerate
his
father
strang
passes
her
hand
down
her
jacket
father
kinder
stooped
to
pick
me
up
adds
matt
a
nice
moloch
to
trust
with
children
she
exclaims
in
terrible
accents
david
shrinks
before
the
blaze
of
her
eyes
almost
feeling
his
coat
drying
under
it
when
you
manage
to
drownd
you
try
to
kill
with
rheumatics
and
then
hev
all
the
responsibility
to
make
a
body
throw
up
the
position
take
off
your
clothes
both
both
of
them
look
at
each
other
feeling
vaguely
the
indelicacy
of
stripping
at
table
they
put
their
hands
to
their
jackets
as
if
to
compromise
then
a
simultaneous
recollection
crimsons
their
faces
their
are
gone
so
david
rises
solemnly
and
leads
the
way
and
matt
follows
and
voice
brings
up
the
rear
and
goes
with
them
into
the
bedroom
stinging
and
excoriating
they
shut
the
door
but
it
comes
through
the
and
winds
itself
about
their
naked
limbs
strang
distributing
flapjacks
to
her
brood
all
the
while
and
david
biting
his
lips
to
block
the
muzzle
of
his
for
he
never
swears
before
mother
and
the
children
except
when
he
is
not
angry
suddenly
remembers
that
if
he
is
to
join
his
ship
at
by
thursday
he
must
take
the
packet
from
partridge
island
his
is
over
he
has
this
every
two
or
three
years
and
his
beautiful
beloved
is
all
amorousness
and
amiability
and
the
best
room
with
the
chairs
is
thrown
open
for
occupation
but
after
a
few
weeks
strang
is
repossessed
of
her
demon
and
then
it
is
david
who
throws
up
the
position
and
goes
down
to
the
sea
in
a
ship
and
does
more
business
of
a
mysterious
sort
in
the
great
waters
and
so
on
the
morrow
of
the
adventure
he
kisses
his
bairns
and
his
wife
all
amorousness
and
amiability
again
and
passes
with
wavings
of
his
stick
along
the
dusty
road
under
the
red
hemlocks
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
so
into
the
great
beyond
passes
and
with
him
all
that
savor
of
strange
romantic
seas
all
that
flavor
of
bustling
foreign
ports
that
he
brings
to
the
lonely
farm
and
that
cling
about
it
even
in
his
absence
exhaling
from
envelopes
with
picturesque
stamps
and
letters
with
exotic
headings
passes
narrowing
the
universe
for
his
little
ones
and
making
their
own
bit
of
soil
sterner
and
their
winter
colder
he
is
dead
this
brawny
father
incredibly
dead
and
the
dead
face
haunts
matt
no
vaporous
mask
but
stonily
substantial
bobbing
grewsomely
in
a
green
sickly
light
fathoms
down
with
froth
on
its
lips
and
slimy
things
of
the
sea
twining
in
its
hair
he
looks
questioningly
at
his
own
face
in
the
fragment
of
mirror
trying
to
realize
that
it
too
will
undergo
petrifaction
and
wondering
how
and
when
he
looks
at
his
face
furtively
and
wonders
if
the
volcano
beneath
it
will
ever
really
sleep
he
pictures
her
rigid
underground
the
long
black
eyelashes
neatly
drawn
down
and
is
momentarily
pleased
with
the
piquant
contrast
they
make
with
the
waxen
skin
is
it
possible
the
freshness
and
beauty
of
face
can
decay
too
can
billy
sink
to
a
painless
rest
with
his
leg
perhaps
growing
straight
again
ah
mayhap
in
case
death
were
no
such
grisly
mystery
morbid
thoughts
enough
for
a
boy
who
should
be
profiting
by
the
goodness
of
the
northwester
towards
boykind
but
even
before
this
greater
tragedy
last
accident
had
taken
the
zest
out
of
enjoyment
of
the
ice
in
former
good
years
he
had
been
the
first
to
cut
fancy
figures
on
the
ponds
and
frozen
marshes
or
to
coast
down
the
slopes
in
a
fitted
with
an
upright
and
a
a
machine
of
his
own
invention
worthy
of
the
race
of
craftsmen
from
which
he
sprang
but
this
year
the
glow
of
the
blood
became
the
heat
of
remorse
when
he
saw
or
remembered
wistful
eyes
he
gave
up
skating
and
contented
himself
with
modelling
the
annual
man
of
snow
for
the
school
at
cobequid
village
in
the
which
village
to
take
time
a
little
by
the
forelock
his
death
did
not
remain
a
wonder
for
the
proverbial
nine
days
for
a
week
the
young
men
chewing
their
evening
quid
round
the
glowing
of
the
store
stove
or
on
milder
nights
tapping
their
toes
under
the
verandas
of
the
one
village
road
as
they
gazed
up
vacantly
at
the
female
shadows
flitting
across
the
gabled
of
the
wooden
houses
spoke
in
their
slightly
nasal
accent
with
an
emphasis
on
the
of
the
of
the
watter
and
calling
for
their
letters
held
converse
with
the
postmistress
on
watter
and
its
and
expectorated
copiously
presumably
in
lieu
of
weeping
and
the
outlying
farmers
who
dashed
up
with
a
lively
jingle
of
to
tether
their
horses
to
the
outside
the
stores
or
to
the
surrounding
the
little
wooden
for
the
most
combined
business
with
religion
were
regaled
with
the
news
ere
they
had
finished
swathing
their
beasts
in
their
buffalo
robes
and
and
it
lent
an
added
solemnity
to
the
appeal
of
the
little
spire
standing
out
ghostly
against
the
indigo
sky
and
of
the
frosty
windows
glowing
mystically
with
blood
in
the
gleam
of
the
chandelier
lamps
and
mayhap
wrought
more
than
the
drawling
exposition
of
the
fusty
minister
and
the
old
grannies
smoking
their
clay
pipes
as
they
crouched
over
the
winter
hearth
their
wizened
faces
ruddy
with
firelight
mumbled
and
grunted
contentedly
over
the
tidbit
and
sighed
through
nostrils
as
they
spread
their
gnarled
skinny
hands
to
the
dancing
balsamic
blaze
but
after
everybody
had
mourned
and
moralized
and
expectorated
for
seven
days
a
new
death
came
to
oust
david
from
popular
favor
a
death
which
had
not
only
novelty
but
equal
sensationalism
combined
with
a
more
genuinely
local
tang
for
it
involved
a
funeral
at
home
handsome
susan
hailey
driving
her
horses
recklessly
her
black
feather
waving
gallantly
in
the
wind
had
dashed
her
sleigh
upon
a
trunk
uprooted
by
the
storm
and
hidden
by
the
snow
she
was
flung
forward
her
head
striking
the
tree
so
that
the
brave
feather
dribbled
blood
while
the
horses
bolted
off
to
cobequid
village
to
bear
the
tragic
news
in
the
empty
sleigh
and
so
the
young
men
with
the
carbuncles
of
tobacco
in
their
cheek
expectorated
more
and
spoke
of
the
of
the
land
and
walking
home
from
the
the
sopranos
discussed
it
with
the
basses
and
in
the
where
the
matrons
met
to
make
undergarments
for
the
heathen
there
was
much
shaking
of
the
head
with
retrospective
prophesyings
and
whispers
of
drink
and
commiseration
for
hey
and
all
the
adjacent
villages
went
to
the
sermon
at

house

deceased
lady

salary
she
annually
contributed

kegs

in
his
nasal
address
and
everybody
including
the
strangs
and
their
collie
went
on
to
the
lonesome
graveyard
some
on
horse
and
some
on
foot
and
some
in
sleighs
the
coffin
leading
the
way
in
a
pung
or
long
a
black
nondescript
procession
crawling
dismally
over
the
white
moaning
landscape
between
the
zigzag
ridges
of
snow
marking
the
buried
fences
past
the
trailing
disconsolate
firs

funereal

chapter

the
thoughts
of

other
rumors
too
came
by
coach
to
the
village
rumors
of
blizzard
and
shipwreck
each
with
its
opportunities
of
exhortation
and
expectoration
but
in
the
lonely
forest
home
past
which
the
dazzling
rattled
with
only
a
blast
on
the
horn
the
tragic
end
of
david
strang
stood
out
in
equal
loneliness
for
death
when
he
smites
the
poor
often
cuts
off
not
only
the
beloved
but
the
and
though
in
a
literal
sense
the
strangs
made
their
own
bread
yet
it
was
david
who
kept
the
roof
over
their
head
and
the
ground
under
their
feet
but
for
his
remittances
the
interest
on
the
mortgage
under
which
they
held
the
farm
and
the
house
could
not
have
been
paid
for
the
produce
of
the
clearing
the
bit
of
buckwheat
and

barely

harriet
and
matt
eking
out
the
resources
of
the
family
by
earning
a
little
in
kind
sometimes
even
in
money
matt
was
a
skilful
soapmaker
decorating
his
bars
with
fanciful
devices
and
he
delighted
in
a
poetic
process
involving
a
temporary
residence
in
a
or
a
cabin
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
now
that
the
overdue
mortgage
money
had
gone
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
more
money
must
be
raised
immediately
that
the
dead
man
had
any
claim
upon
the
consideration
of
his
employers
did
not
occur
to
the
bereaved
family
rather
it
seemed
he
owed
the
owners
compensation
for
the
lost
a
family
council
was
held
on
the
evening
of
the
day
so
blackly
begun
not
even
the
baby
was
excluded
it
sat
before
the
stove
on
its
lap
and
crowed
at
the
great
burning
logs
that
silhouetted
the
walls
with
leaping
shadows
sprat
too
was
present
crouched
on
as
the
children
called
the
rag
mat
their
brother
had
braided
thrusting
forward
his
black
muzzle
when
the
door
rattled
with
special
violence
and
by
his
side
lay
the
boy
staring
into
the
tumbling
flames
yet
taking
the
lead
in
the
council
with
a
new
authoritative
ring
in
his
voice
wherever
the
realities
of
life
beleaguer
the
soul
there
children
are
born
serious
and
experience
soon
puts
an
old
head
on
young
shoulders
the
pappoose
that
the
indian
squaw
carries
sandwichwise
back
and
board
does
not
cry
dump
it
down
and
it
stands
stolid
like
a
pawn
on
a
chessboard
hang
it
on
a
projecting
knot
in
the
props
of
a
and
it
sways
like
a
snared
rabbit
matt
strang
strenuous
little
soul
had
always
a
gravity
beyond
his
years
his
removal
seemed
to
equal
his
years
to
his
gravity
he
knew
himself
the
head
of
the
house
harriet
despite
her
superior
summers
was
of
the
wrong
sex
and
his
mother
though
she
had
physical
force
to
back
her
was
not
a
reasoning
being
for
a
time
no
doubt
she
would
be
quieted
by
the
peace
of
the
grave
which
all
but
the
crowing
infant
felt
solemnizing
the
household
but
matt
had
no
hope
of
more
than
a
truce
it
was
the
brain
and
the
voice
that
prevailed
at
the
daisy
was
to
be
killed
and
salted
down
and
sold
fortunately
she
was
getting
on
in
years
and
besides
they
could
never
have
had
the
heart
to
eat
their
poor
old
friend
themselves
with
her
affectionate
old
nose
and
her
faithful
udders
the
calves
were
to
become
veal
and
all
this
meat
together
with
the
fodder
thus
set
free
deacon
hailey
was
to
be
besought
to
take
at
a
valuation
in
lieu
of
the
mortgage
money
for
money
itself
could
not
be
hoped
for
from
cobequid
village
though
the
ruled
here
as
elsewhere
it
was
an
unseen
monarch
whose
imperial
court
was
at
halifax
there
matt
might
have
got
current
coin
here
barter
was
all
the
vogue
accounts
were
kept
in
english
money
it
was
not
till
a
few
years
later
that
the
dollar
became
the
standard
coin
for
their
own
eating
matt
calculated
that
he
would
catch
more
rabbits
and
shoot
more
partridges
than
in
years
of
yore
and
in
the
summer
he
would
work
on
neighboring
farms
harriet
would
have
to
extend
her
sewing
practice
and
collaborate
with
matt
in
making
for
the
fishermen
and
strang
would
get
spinning
jobs
from
the
wives
which
being
settled
with
a
definiteness
that
left
even
a
balance
of
savings
the
widow
handed
the
infant
in
her
arms
to
harriet
and
replacing
it
by
the
big
bible
she
slipped
on
her
spectacles
with
a
nervous
involuntary
glance
round
the
kitchen
and
asked
the
teddy
to
stick
a
finger
into
the
book
opening
the
holy
tome
at
that
place
she
began
to
read
from
the
head
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
in
a
solemn
prophetic
voice
that
suited
with
her
black
cap
pinched
up
at
the
edges
she
had
no
choice
of
texts
pricking
was
her
invariable
procedure
when
she
felt
a
call
to
prelection
and
the
issue
was
an
uncertainty
dubiously
delightful
for
one
day
there
would
be
a
story
or
a
miracle
to
stir
the
blood
and
another
day
a
bald
genealogy
and
a
third
day
a
chapter
of
revelation
all
read
with
equal
reverence
as
equally
inspiring
parts
of
an
equally
inspired
whole
matt
breathed
freely
when
his
mother
announced
ezra
chap
not
because
he
had
any
interest
in
ezra
but
because
he
knew
it
was
a
pictureless
portion
when
the
text
was
liable
to
be
interrupted
by
illustrations
the
reading
was
liable
to
be
interrupted
by
remonstrances
for
scarce
a
picture
but
bore
the
marks
of
his
illuminating
brush
and
his
rude
palette
of
ground
charcoal
chalk
and
he
had
been
prompted
to
color
before
his
hand
itched
to
imitate
and
in
later
years
these
episodes
of
the
far
east
had
found
their
way
to
planed
boards
of
western
pine
with
the
figures
often
in
new
experimental
combinations
and
these
scenes
were
in
their
turn
planed
away
to
make
room
for
others
equally
unsatisfactory
to
the
critical
artist
but
his
mother
had
never
been
able
to
forgive
the
iniquities
of
his
prime
not
even
after
she
had
executed
vengeance
on
the
sinner
she
had
brought
the
sacred
volume
from
her
home
at
halifax
and
a
colored
bible
she
had
never
seen
color
made
religion
cheerful
destroyed
its
essential
austerity
it
could
no
more
be
conceived
apart
from
black
and
white
than
a
minister
of
the
gospel
an
especial
grievance
hovered
about
the
early
chapters
of
exodus
for
matt
had
stained
the
red
sea
with
the
reddish
hue
of
the
bay
of
fundy
a
sacrilege
to
his
mother
to
whose
fervid
imagination
the
sea
of
miracles
loomed
lurid
with
sacred
sanguineousness
to
which
no
profane
water
offered
any
parallel
but
ezra
is
far
from
exodus
and
the
reminder
was
not
likely
a
gleam
of
exaltation
illumined
the
eyes
when
she
read
the
first
verse
at
the
second
her
face
seemed
to
flush
as
if
the
firelight
had
shot
up
suddenly
when
ezra
hed
prayed
when
he
hed
confessed
himself
down
before
the
house
of
god
there
assembled
unto
him
out
of
israel
a
very
great
congregation
of
men
and
women
and
children
fur
the
people
wept
very
sore
shechaniah
the
son
of
jehiel

of
the
sons
of

unto
ezra
we
hev
trespassed
against
our

hev
taken

wives
of

of

she
read
on
pausing
only
at
the
ends
of
the
verses
harriet
knitted
stockings
over
head
the
smaller
children
listened
in
awe
thoughts
soon
passed
from
shechaniah
the
son
of
jehiel
uninterested
even
by
his
relationship
to
elam
usually
when
the
was
dull
and
when
he
was
tired
of
watching
the
wavering
shadows
on
the
walls
he
got
up
a
factitious
interest
by
noting
the
initial
letter
of
each
verse
and
timing
its
length
in
view
of
his
task
of
memorizing
for
each
week
a
verse
beginning
with
some
specified
letter
his
verbal
memory
being
indifferent
he
would
spend
hours
in
searching
for
the
tiniest
verse
wasting
thereby
an
amount
of
time
in
which
he
could
have
overcome
the
longest
though
as
he
indirectly
scanned
great
tracts
of
the
bible
it
may
be
this
a
b
c
business
was
but
the
device
of
a
crafty
deacon
skilled
in
the
young
idea
however
this
be
mind
was
deeplier
moved
the
shriek
of
the
blind
wind
without
contrasted
with
the
cheerful
crackle
of
the
logs
within
and
the
woful
contrast
brought
up
that
weird
image
destined
to
haunt
him
for
so
long
he
shuddered
to
think
of
it
down
there
in
the
cold
excluded
forever
from
the
warm
hearth
of
life
was
not
that
its
voice
in
the
wind
wailing
crying
to
be
let
in
shaking
the
door
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
vaguely
he
heard
his
voice
intoning
solemnly
of
the
sons
of
immer
hanani
and
zebadiah
of
the
sons
of
harim
maaseiah
elijah
shemaiah
jehiel
uzziah
of
the
sons
of
pashur
the
baby
was
still
smiling
and
tangling
knitting
but
billy
had
fallen
asleep
and
presently
matt
found
himself
studying
the
flicker
of
the
firelight
upon
the
little
pinched
face
of
the
sons
of
zattu
elioenai
eliashib
mattaniah
jeremoth
zabad
aziza
of
the
sons
also
of

the
prophetic
voice
rose
and
fell
unwaveringly
unwearyingly

ought
to

came
suddenly
from
the
brooding
lips

she
burst
into
tears
blistering
the
precious
page
harriet
ceased
to
ply
her
needles
they
seemed
to
be
going
through
her
bosom
the
baby
enjoyed
a
free
hand
with
the
wool
billy
slept
on
presently
strang
choked

wiped

shut
the

with
an
emphatic
bang
and
matt
rose
from
side
and
put
it
away
course

go
back
to

any

he
said
lightly
remembering
the

mother
said
matt
amused
by
her
muddled
finance
yet
it
was
the
less
logical
if
even
more
specious
argument
of
completing
the
snow
months
for
only
young
and
useless
children
went
to
school
in
the
summer
that
appealed
to
him
the
human
mind
is
strangely
under
the
sway
of
times
and
seasons
and
the
calendar
is
the
stanchest
ally
of
sloth
and
procrastination
and
so
strang
settled
in
temporary
triumph
to
her
task
of
making
new
black
mourning
dresses
for
the
girls
out
of
her
old
merino
and
a
few
days
afterwards
when
matt
had
carried
out
his
financial
programme
satisfactorily
except
that
deacon
valuation
did
not
afford
the
estimated
surplus
he
joined
the
other
children
in
their
pilgrimage
schoolward
the
young
strangs
amounted
to
a
procession
at
its
head
came
matt
drawing
billy
on
a
little
by
a
that
came
through
the
in
the
peaks
of
the
runners
and
the
end
of
sprat
who
sneaked
after
the
children
formed
a
literal
tail
to
it
till
arriving
too
far
to
be
driven
back
the
animal
ran
to
the
front
in
fearless
gambollings
this
morning
the
air
was
keen
and
bright
the
absence
of
wind
preventing
the
real
temperature
from
being
felt
and
the
sun
lit
up
the
white
woods
with
cold
sparkle
ere
the
children
had
covered
the
two
miles
most
of
them
conceived
such
a
new
appetite
that
their
fingers
itched
to
undo
their
lunch
packets
a
halt
was
called
the
was
unwrapped
and
while
the
future
was
being
recklessly
sacrificed
to
the
present
by
the
younger
savages
matt
edified
them
by
drawing
on
the
snow
with
the
point
of
crutch
they
followed
the
development
of
these
designs
with
vociferous
anticipation
one
shouting
cow
and
another
before
more
than
a
curve
was
outlined
matt
always
amused
himself
by
commencing
at
the
most
unlikely
part
of
the
figure
and
working
round
gradually
in
unexpected
ways
so
as
to
keep
the
secret
to
the
last
possible
moment
sometimes
when
it
had
been
guessed
too
early
he
would
contrive
to
convert
a
fox
into
a
moose
his
enjoyment
of
his
dexterity
countervailing
the
twinge
of
his
conscience
all
the
animals
were
tamer
than
usual
the
boy
drew
listlessly
abstractedly
unresentful
when
his
secret
was
guessed
in
the
first
stages
and
at
last
half
of
itself
the
crutch
began
to
shape
a
face
a
face
with
shut
eyes
and
dripping
hair
indefinably
uncanny
cried
ted
in
thick
triumphant
tones
exultation
tempered
by
mastication
but
the
older
children
held
their
breath
and
exclamation
was
succeeded
by
an
awesome
silence
suddenly
a
sagging
bough
snapped
and
fell
the
collie
howled
and
matt
roused
from
his
reverie
saw
that
face
had
grown
white
as
the
dead
snow
the
child
was
palsied
with
terror
matt
feared
one
of
his
fits
was
coming
on
in
a
frenzy
of
remorse
he
blurred
out
the
face
with
the
crutch
and
hustled
the
sled
forward
singing
cheerily
jesus
meek
and
mild
look
upon
a
little
child
pity
my
simplicity
and
suffer
me
to
come
to
the
children
took
up
the
burden
sifting
themselves
instinctively
into
trebles
and
seconds
in
a
harmony
loud
enough
to
rouse
the
hibernating
bear
face
returned
to
its
normal
pallor
and
to
its
abstraction
in
the
a
bare
plastered
room
cold
and
uninviting
with
a
crowd
of
boys
and
girls
at
its
notched
pine
desks
he
continued
pensive
there
was
nothing
to
distract
his
abstraction
for
even
ruth
hailey
was
away
the
geography
lesson
roused
him
to
a
temporary
attention
london
flitted
across
his
dreams
the
halifax
of
england
that
mighty
city
in
which
pictures
were
saleable
for
actual
coin
and
a
mighty
the
matt
strang
of
england
was
paid
for
play
as
if
for
work
but
the
with
its
of
solid
stories
and
essays
peppered
with
religious
texts
restored
him
to
his
reveries
mctavit
who
was
shaping
quills
with
his
knife
called
upon
him
to
commence
the
chapter
but
he
stared
at
the
little
pedagogue
blankly
unaware
of
the
call
he
was
noting
dreamily
how
his
jagged
teeth
showed
beneath
the
thin
snuffy
upper
lip
and
the
trick
the
mouth
had
of
remaining
wide
open
after
it
had
ceased
talking
he
tried
to
analyze
why
mctavit
was
not
smiling
months
ago
seeking
to
make
his
figures
smile
the
boy
had
discovered
the
rident
effect
of
a
wide
mouth
and
now
he
essayed
to
analyze
the
subtle
muscular
movements
that
separate
the
sublime
from
the
ridiculous
suddenly
the
haunting
thought
recurred
to
him
with
a
new
application
even
freckled
face
would
one
day
be
frozen
those
twitching
eyelids
still
the
thin
wide
lips
shut
forever
how
long
more
would
he
stride
about
his
motley
scattering
blows
and
information
would
he
come
to
a
stop
in
the
as
the
clock
sometimes
did
grown
suddenly
silent
its
oil
congealed
by
the
intense
cold
or
would
death
find
him
in
bed
ready
stretched
and
the
restless
boys
and
girls
around
him
good
god
they
too
would
one
day
be
very
peaceful
mere
blocks
carroty
kitty
who
was
pinching
amy
arm
and
peter
besant
who
was
throwing
those
pellets
of
bread
and
even
simon
the
wagging
tongue
would
be
still
as
a
plummet
they
would
all
grow
rigid
alike
not
all
at
once
nor
in
one
way
but
some
very
soon
perhaps
and
others
when
they
were
grown
tall
and
yet
others
when
they
were
bent
and
grizzled
some
on
sea
and
some
on
land
some
in
this
part
of
the
map
and
some
in
that
some
peacefully
some
in
pain
petrified
one
by
one
ruthlessly
remorselessly
impartially
till
at
last
all
the
busy
hubbub
was
hushed
and
of
all
that
lively
crew
of
youngsters
not
one
was
left
to
feel
the
sun
and
the
rain
the
pity
of
it
thrilled
him
even
freckled
face
grew
softer
through
the
veil
of
mist
then
as
his
vision
cleared
he
saw
the
face
was
really
darker
strange
emotions
seemed
to
agitate
it
obstinate
are
ye
it
screamed
with
startling
suddenness
at
the
same
instant
something
shining
flew
through
the
air
and
whizzing
past
ear
sent
back
a
little
thud
from
behind
matt
turned
his
head
in
astonishment
and
saw
a
penknife
quivering
in
the
wall
he
turned
back
in
fresh
surprise
and
saw
that
face
had
changed
from
black
to
red
as
its
owner
realized
how
near
had
been
and
his
own
escape
awake
at
last
he
blustered
na
your
attention
well
what
are
ye
at
are
ye
na
to
fetch
me
my
knife
not
a
dog
answered
matt
sullenly
dinna
bark
ye
think
because
lost
your
father
preevileged
to
lose
your
manners
he
added
with
an
epigrammatic
afterthought
that
mollified
him
more
than
an
apology
verra
obleeged
to
you
he
concluded
with
elaborate
emphasis
as
simon
the
sneak
handed
him
the
knife
then
he
said
again
read
your
paragraph
richt
simon
show
him
the
mctavit
hailed
from
cape
breton
isle
and
was
popularly
supposed
to
soliloquize
in
gaelic
this
hurt
him
when
he
proposed
to
the
postmistress
who
had
been
to
in
truro
she
declared
she
would
not
have
a
man
who
did
not
speak
good
english
do
speak
guid
english
he
protested
passionately
not
in
the
when
only
to
my
pupils
and
it
dinna
matter
but
in
private
and
in
society
most
mctavit
was
still
a
bachelor
and
still
spoke
guid
english
when
the
had
come
to
an
end
matt
was
left
again
to
his
own
thoughts
for
while
poor
mctavit
gave
the
juniors
an
exercise
in
grammar
which
they
alleviated
by
matt
and
a
few
other
pupils
were
allotted
the
tranquillizing
task
of
multiplying
in
by
the
sums
were
so
colossal
that
matt
wondered
whether
they
existed
in
the
world
and
if
so
how
many
pictures
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
to
obtain
them
an
awful
silence
brooded
over
the
room
for
when
written
exercises
were
on
the
pupils
took
care
to
do
their
talking
silently
lest
they
should
be
suspected
of
copying
this
being
what
they
were
doing
there
was
a
little
museum
case
behind
desk
containing
stuffed
skunks
and
other
animals
and
local
minerals
lovingly
collected
by
him
stilbite
and
heulandite
and
quartz
and
amethyst
and
spar
and
bits
of
jasper
and
curiously
clouded
agate
picked
up
near
cape
blomidon
amid
the
débris
of
crumbling
cliffs
at
such
times
mctavit
would
stand
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
his
treasures
his
rod
carelessly
tucked
under
his
arm
as
one
world
forgetting
by
the
world
then
the
tension
of
silence
became
positively
painful
for
the
had
long
since
discovered
that
the
museum
case
was
a
reflector
and
mctavit
though
he
prided
himself
on
the
secret
of
his
argus
eye
never
caught
any
but
novices
not
yet
initiated
into
the
traditions
imagine
therefore
the
shock
both
to
him
and
the
room
when
the
acute
stillness
was
broken
by
a
loud
cry
of
bang
bang
an
irresistible
guffaw
swept
over
the
school
and
under
cover
of
the
laughter
the
cute
and
ready
collogued
as
to
thundered
mctavit
was
that
in
the
even
more
poignant
silence
of
reaction
a
small
still
voice
was
heard
sir
it
was
me
said
matt
remorsefully
it
was
you
was
it
then
bang
bang
bang
for
and
as
he
spoke
the
angry
little
man
accentuated
each
with
a
vicious
thwack
then
his
eye
caught
sight
of
in
lieu
of
ranged
columns
of
figures
was
a
rough
sketch
of
a
line
of
great
overhung
by
and
apparently
converging
all
their
batteries
against
one
little
ship
on
whose
deck
a
stalwart
man
stood
solitary
wrapped
in
a
flag
mctavit
choked
with
added
rage
your
books
agen
what
what
call
that
he
spluttered
said
matt
sulkily
echoed
mctavit
and
was
so
pleased
with
the
universal
guffaw
whereof
the
cute
and
ready
took
advantage
to
compare
notes
as
before
that
he
contented
himself
with
the
one
slash
that
was
necessary
to
drive
the
jest
home
but
it
was
one
slash
too
much
vocal
cannonade
had
been
purely
involuntary
but
he
was
willing
to
suffer
for
his
imagination
the
last
insult
however
subtly
felt
as
an
injury
to
his
dead
father
too
set
his
blood
on
fire
he
suddenly
remembered
that
this
blockhead
was
at
any
rate
the
of
a
family
that
he
could
no
longer
afford
to
be
degraded
before
the
little
ones
who
were
looking
on
with
pain
and
awe
he
rose
and
walked
towards
the
door
are
ye
cried
mctavit
find
captain
treasure
learned
all
i
want
to
know
said
matt
better
come
matt
turned
walked
back
to
his
seat
possessed
himself
of
his
and
walked
to
the
door
you
fellers
he
said
cheerfully
as
he
passed
out
the
girls
he
ignored
mctavit
gave
chase
with
raised
rod
regardless
of
the
pandemonium
that
rose
up
in
his
wake
matt
was
walking
slowly
across
the
field
with
sprat
leaping
up
to
lick
his
face
the
dog
had
rejoined
him
mctavit
went
back
his
rod
hanging
down
behind
matt
walked
on
sadly
his
blood
cooled
by
the
sharp
air
another
link
with
the
past
was
broken
forever
he
looked
back
at
the
simple
wooden
with
the
ensign
of
smoke
fluttering
above
its
pitched
roof
kinder
memories
of
mctavit
surged
at
his
heart
his
little
jests
at
the
expense
of
the
boys
his
occasional
reminiscences
of
his
native
cape
breton
and
of
john
new
brunswick
with
its
mighty
cathedral
the
of
he
had
lent
him
last
year
his
prowess
with
line
and
hook
the
summer
he
boarded
with
the
strangs
in
lieu
of
and
then
with
a
sudden
flash
came
the
crowning
recollection
of
his
talent
for
cutting
turreted
castles
and
tigers
and
anything
you
pleased
out
of
the
biscuits
and
the
chunks
of
the
children
brought
for
lunch
thoughts
went
back
to
the
beginnings
of
his
school
career
when
mctavit
had
spurred
him
on
to
master
the
alphabet
by
transforming
his
into
any
animal
from
ass
to
zebra
he
remembered
the
joy
with
which
he
had
ordered
and
eaten
his
first
elephant
pausing
a
moment
to
cut
a
stick
and
drive
sprat
off
with
it
he
walked
back
into
the
wondering
sir
sorry
i
went
away
so
rudely
he
said
cut
you
a
new
birch
mctavit
was
touched
you
he
said
simply
as
he
took
it
the
matter
he
roared
seeing
simon
the
hand
go
up
sir
you
better
try
if
he
split
it
and
put
a
hair
in
idea
yelled
mctavit
grimly
that
and
the
new
birch
rod
made
its
trial
slash
at
the
raised
hand
chapter
iv
strang
was
busy
in
deacon
kitchen
the
providential
death
of
hailey
had
given
her
chores
to
do
at
the
homestead
for
female
servants
or
even
male
were
scarce
in
the
colony
and
ruth
had
been
brought
up
by
her
mother
to
play
on
the
harpsichord
when
strang
got
home
after
a
three
mile
walk
sometimes
through
sleet
and
slush
she
would
walk
up
and
down
till
the
small
hours
spinning
carded
wool
into
yarn
at
her
great
uncouth
wheel
and
weeping
automatically
at
her
loneliness
reft
even
of
the
occasional
husband
for
whom
she
had
forsaken
the
great
naval
city
of
her
girlhood
the
beautiful
capital
to
make
a
body
throw
up
the
position
she
would
cry
hysterically
to
the
deaf
rafters
when
the
children
were
asleep
and
only
the
wind
was
awake
but
the
droning
wheel
went
round
just
the
same
steady
as
the
wheel
of
time
strang
moving
to
and
fro
like
a
shuttle
till
the
task
was
completed
and
morning
often
found
her
and
fractious
and
lachrymose
matt
would
have
pitied
her
more
if
she
had
pitied
herself
less
in
the
outside
world
however
she
had
no
airs
of
martyrdom
bearing
herself
genially
and
independently
at
the
held
in
private
houses
she
was
an
important
sinful
figure
though
neither
harriet
nor
matt
had
yet
found
grace
or
membership
she
smiled
a
pleasant
response
when
deacon
hailey
came
in
from
the
tannery
and
said
it
was
a
large
low
kitchen
heated
by
an
american
stove
with
a
gleaming
dresser
and
black
wooden
beams
from
which
hams
hung
the
deacon
felt
more
comfortable
there
than
in
the
room
in
which
ruth
was
at
that
moment
engaged
in
tinkling
the
harpsichord
a
room
that
contained
other
archaic
heirlooms
old
china
a
tapestry
screen
scriptural
mottoes
worked
in
ancestral
hair
and
a
large
colored
lithograph
of
the
ark
on
mount
ararat
for
refusing
to
come
away
from
which
matt
had
once
been
clouted
by
his
mother
before
all
the
neighbors
the
house
was
indeed
uncommonly
luxurious
sheltered
by
double
doors
and
windows
and
warmly
wrapped
in
its
winter
cincture
of
billy
asked
the
deacon

a
the
deacon
suppressed
a
smile
of
labor
was
scarcer
than
ever
that
year
and
in
his
idea
of
marrying
harriet
strang
which
he
was
now
cautiously
about
to
broach
the
possibility
of
securing
the
gratuitous
services
of
the
elder
children
counted
not
a
little
enhancing
the
beauty
of
his
prospective

he
replied
feelingly
glad
to
hear
it
strang
for
i
know
you

this

the

i
only

room
in

though
when
you

hey
what
a
pity
poor

he
said
with
a
guffaw
strang
paused
startled
the
idea
took
away
her
breath
the
deacon
smiled
on
in
the
embarrassing
silence
the
tinkle
of
harpsichord
sounded
like
an
orchestra
would
raelly
like
my
harriet

a

worked
his

carefully
into

complacently
enjoying
overwhelmed
condition
presumably
due
to
his
condescension
course
heaps
of
gals
every

all

and
druv
off

in

the

the
deacon
paused
to
cut
himself
a
wedge
of
tobacco
imperturbably
there
was
no
trace
of
his
disappointment
visible
with
characteristic
promptitude
he
was
ready
for
the
next
best
thing
who
wants
her
to
marry
anybody
else
he
asked
raising
his
eyebrows
do
you
gasped
strang
purpling
right
give
her
her
head
a
bit
it
do
to
tie
a
gal
to
her
you
may
take
a
horse
to
the
water
but

make
her
drink
hey
no

i
kinder
thought
gasped
strang
looking
handsomer
than
ever
in
the
rosy
glow
of
confusion
kinder
thought
echoed
old
hey
spitting
accurately
under
the
stove
you
wanted
harriet
so
i
guessed
she
could
live
here
more
comfortable
than
to
home
i
ask
no
reward
widder
and
the
orphan
as
scripter
says
hey
mean

shouted
the
deacon
me
well
i
swow
me
whose
susan
hes
only
been
dead
five
months
a
proper
thing
to
me
of
why

hardly
cold
in
her
grave
afore
of

your
pardin
said
the
abashed
woman
well
you
may
i
do
declare
five
months
arter
the
funeral
indeed
why
ten
months
at
least
must
elapse
but
you
teetotally
mistook
my
strang
a
woman
be
a
woman
with
a
heart
a
soul
not
an
unbroken
filly
all
i
was
of
was
could
thet
thar
abner
preep
clothe
and
feed
your
darter
but
i
the
man
to
bear
malice
and
till
you
kin
feel
you
kin
trust
her
to
him
or
some
other
man
my
house
is
open
to
her
i
draw
back
my
offer
and
when
i
made
it
i
was
quite
aware
you
would
hev
to
be
on
the
spot
too
to
look
arter
her
hey
not
too
ole
and
the
deacon
smiled
again
here
all
day
here
he
half
knelt
down
to
attend
to
the
stove
which
was
smoking
very
slightly
be
much
of
a
change
to
sleep
here
hey
but
the
other
children
hailey
the
man
to
forgit
i
guess
he
said
over
his
shoulder
he
talks

thinks

it
soak
hey
is
it
likely
take
you
over

the
little
uns
motherless
i
never
like
this
kind
of
he
fidgeted
impatiently
with
the
mechanism
at
the
back
making
the
iron
rattle
i
understand
faltered
strang
her
heart
beginning
to
beat
painfully
you
do
go
on
strang
when
i
marriage
you
jump
at
it
and
when
i
am
you
hang
back
like
a
mare
afore
a
dyke
ah
better
and
he
adjusted
the
damper
noisily
with
a
great
sigh
of
satisfaction
want
to
marry
gasped
strang
the
dark
handsome
features
flushed
yet
deeper
her
bosom
heaved
struck
it
i
do
want
ter
plain
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
threw
his
head
back
and
his
chest
forward
allus
find
me
straightforward
strang
i
beat
about
the
bush
hey
but
i
hev
spoke

prematoor
if

me
to
it
by
your
mistake
harriet
es
if
i
could
marry
a
giddy
young
gal
with
her

full
worldly
thoughts

was
how

then
how
to

without
you
into

a
mother

the
more
i
took

the
more
you
figured

a

crown
to
her
hey
if

whereas

a
but
what

deacon
hailey
say
he
says
jest
put
all
thet
outer
your
mind
strang
think
the
man

the
man
with
no
one
to
devote
himself
he
took
her
hand
and
she
did
not
withdraw
it
emotion
made
her
breathing
difficult
in
the
new
light
in
which
he
appeared
to
her
she
saw
that
he
was
still
a
proper
man
straight
and
tall
and
sturdy
and
bright
of
eye
despite
his
grizzled
beard
and
hair
if
you
give
him
devotion
in
return
jest
you
say
so
plump
take
a
lesson
from
his
straightforwardness
hey
you
think
your
mortgage
or
his
money
happiness
hey
you
go

for
your
children
poor
little
future
i
hold
with

wholesale

the
fust
law
of
nater
hey
it
be
fair
to
all
ye
hev
to
arx
yourself
is
jest
this
kin
you
make
deacon
hailey
happy
in
his
years
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
without
letting
go
her
hand
and
his
eyes
looked
into
hers
i
say
years
no
deception
the
air
all
up
to
sample
how
ole
might
you
think
me
she
said
politely
sixty
he
replied
triumphantly
i
hev
my
cold
bath
every

your
shaky
boards
that

into
etarnal
bits
at
the
fust
clout
hey

she
faltered

and
the
deacon
lifted
her
chin
playfully
neither
on
us
rough
timber
both
hed
our
wainy
edges
knocked
off
hey
my
father
hed
three
wives
and
still
hale
and
hearty
a
widower
ninety
like
father
like
son
hey
a
deacon
too
down
to
as
deacon
hailey
spoke
of
his
father
he
grew
to
vision
but
she
found
nothing
to
reply
and
her
thoughts
drifted
off
inconsequently
on
the
rivulet
of
sacred
music
ruth
like
it
she
murmured
at
last
ruth
got
to
say
in
the
matter
i
guess
ruth
knows
her
fifth
commandment
so
do
i
my
father
is
the
person
whose
i
shall
arx
on
my
i
allus
make
a
pint
thet
you
may
the
pathetic
picture
of
deacon
hailey
beseeching
his
blessing
knocked
off
ten
years
more
from
his
age
and
it
was
a
young
and
ardent
wooer
whose
grasp
tightened
momently
on
hand
might
go
to
see
him
together
he
said
an
purty
place
rayther
see
halifax
said
strang
weakly
in
the
whirl
of
her
thoughts
tinkling
tune
seemed
the
only
steady
thing
in
the
universe
oh
if
ruth
would
only
play
something
bearing
on
the
situation
so
that
heaven
might
guide
her
in
this
sudden
and
fateful
crisis
too
some
day
said
the
deacon
encouragingly
laying
his
disengaged
hand
caressingly
on
her
hair
go
to
the
circus
she
withdrew
herself
spasmodically
from
his
touch
ask
me
she
cried
presbyterian
and
what
was
your
last
ask
me
harriet
and
matt
air
ongodly
as
it
is
neither
on
found
i
interfere
with
your
doctrines
you

i
allus
thinks
we
all
sarve
the
same
maker
hey
i
guess
purty
at
our
church
punishment
on
me
for
away
from
halifax
where
i
hed
a
church
of
my
own
to
go
to
but
he
never
cared
the
rite
my
poor
davie
i
ought
to
been
expelled
from
membership
there
and
then
a
fact
but
the
elders
were
merciful
sometimes
i
think
the
old
french
nater
that
makes
me
backslide
my
grandfather
came
from
paris
in
at
the
end
the
war
and
settled
to
bay
but
then
he
married
into
a
german
family
that
emigrated
there
the
same
time
and
that
ought
to
made
things
straight
strang
talked
on
glad
to
find
herself
floating
away
from
the
issue
but
the
deacon
caught
her
by
the
hand
again
and
hauled
her
back
be
no
in
deacon
household
you
may
depend
he
said
a
woman
hes
a
godly
husband
satan
takes
to
his
heels
widders
and
es
he
flirts
with
hey
strang
colored
up
again
and
prayed
silently
for
help
from
the
harpsichord
give
you
an
answer
yet
she
said
feebly
old
hey
slowly
squirted
a
stream
of
into
the
air
as
imperturbably
as
a
stone
fountain
figure
want
your
answer
yet
i
tell
you
i
dream
of
agen
for
ages
it
matter
your
in
a
hurry
your
pardner
left
you
three
years
back
but
i
hev
the
morals
the
township
to
consider
our
dooty
in
life
to
set
a
good
example
to
the
weaker
brethren
i
allus
thinks
eight
months
at
least
must
elapse
i
spoke
out
now
your
onfortunate
mistake
harriet
and
all
i
want
is
to
be
sure
thet
when
i
do
come
to
ask
you
in
proper
form
and
in
doo
course
you
say
strang
remained
silent
and
the
harpsichord
was
silent
too
even
that
had
deserted
her
its
sound
might
have
been
tortured
into
some
applicability
but
its
silence
could
be
construed
into
nothing
unless
it
was
taken
to
give
consent
and
then
all
at
once
ruth
struck
a
new
chord
strang
strained
her
ears
to
catch
the
first
bar
the
deacon
could
not
understand
the
sudden
gleam
that
lit
up
her
face
when
the
instrument
broke
into
the
favorite
nova
scotian
song
vacant
chair
at
last
heaven
had
sent
her
a
sign
there
was
a
vacant
chair
and
it
was
her
mission
to
fill
it
is
thet
a
bargen
asked
the
deacon
losing
patience
sure
you
want
me
breathed
strang
in
a
flash
the
arms
were
round
her
and
his
lips
on
hers
she
extricated
herself
almost
as
quickly
by
main
force
to
be
yet
she
cried
indignantly
course
not
strang
retorted
the
deacon
severely
you
asked
if
i
was
sure
and
i
allowed
show
you
deacon
hailey
was
sorter
the
bargen
hey
i
let
you
depart
in
behave
yourself
in
future
she
said
only
half
mollified
as
she
readjusted
her
hair
throw
up
the
position
i
guess
be
off
now
and
she
took
bonnet
and
mantle
from
a
peg
in
anger
strang
i
hope
all
bitterness
be
put
away
from
you
hey
thet
thar
face
yourn
meant
for
he
hastened
to
help
her
on
with
her
things
and
in
the
process
effected
a
reconciliation
by
speaking
of
new
ones
that
would
set
off
her
beauty
better
strang
walked
airily
through
the
slushy
forest
road
as
on
a
primrose
path
she
was
excited
and
radiant
her
troubles
were
rolled
away
and
her
own
and
her
future
assured
and
heaven
itself
had
nodded
assent
her
lonely
heart
was
to
know
a
tenderness
again
it
was
swelling
now
with
gratitude
that
might
well
blossom
into
affection
how
gay
her
home
should
be
with
festive
companies
to
be
balanced
by
mammoth
revivalist
meetings
she
would
be
the
centre
of
hospitality
and
piety
for
the
but
as
she
neared
the
house
which
seemed
to
have
run
to
meet
her
the
primroses
changed
back
to
slush
and
her
face
to
its
habitual
gloom
matt
and
harriet
were
alone
in
the
kitchen
the
girl
was
crocheting
the
boy
daubing
flowers
on
a
board
which
he
slid
under
the
table
as
he
heard
his
mother
stamping
off
the
wet
snow
in
the
passage
strang
detected
the
board
but
she
contented
herself
by
ordering
him
to
go
to
bed
then
she
warmed
her
frozen
hands
at
the
stove
and
relapsed
into
silence
twenty
times
she
opened
her
lips
to
address
harriet
but
the
words
held
back
she
grew
angry
with
her
daughter
at
last
plaguy
onsociable
harriet
she
said
sharply
mother

hailey
began
strang
curiously
stung
by
the
familiar
nickname
and
pricked
by
resentment
into
courage
then
her
voice
failed
and
she
concluded
almost
in
a
murmur

chapter
v
peggy
the
the
old
year
had
rolled
off
into
the
shadows
and
the
new
had
spun
round
as
far
as
april
spring
came
to
earth
for
a
few
hours
a
day
and
behind
her
winter
whistling
clanged
his
iron
gates
refreezing
the
morass
to
which
she
had
reduced
the
roads
even
at
noon
there
was
no
genial
current
in
the
air
unless
you
took
the
sheltered
side
of
hills
and
trees
and
found
spring
nestling
shyly
in
windless
coverts
though
many
a
had
still
to
pass
ere
upon
some
more
shaded
hummock
the
harbinger
mayflower
would
timidly
put
forth
a
white
bud
laden
with
delicate
odor
everywhere
down
the
hills
and
along
the
tracks
in
every
rut
and
hollow
the
sun
saw
a
thousand
dancing
rivulets
gleam
and
run
and
great
freshets
stir
up
the
sullen
rivers
to
sweep
away
dams
and
mills
but
the
moon
looked
down
on
a
white
country
demurely
asleep
early
in
the
month
matt
having
previously
said
farewell
in
earnest
to
left
home
for
the
spring
sugaring
billy
alas
could
not
accompany
him
as
of
yore
so
sprat
was
left
behind
too
by
way
of
compensation
to
billy
for
company
and
matt
took
with
him
an
indian
boy
whose
christian
name
for
he
was
a
roman
catholic
was
tommy
matt
had
picked
up
tommy
in
the
proximate
woods
where
the
noble
savage
ran
wild
in
christian
clothes
tommy
belonged
to
a
tribe
that
had
recently
pitched
its
wigwams
in
the
backlands
a
mile
from
cobequid
village
to
strang
who
despatched
the
sugaring
expedition
and
provisioned
it
he
was
merely
filthy
brat
who
grinned
like
a
chessy
cat
but
to
matt
he
incarnated
the
poetry
of
the
primitive
and
even
spoke
it
not
that
matt
had
more
than
a
few
words
of
algonquinese
but
tommy
broke
english
quite
unhesitatingly
and
his
remarks
if
terse
and
infrequent
were
flowery
and
sometimes
intelligible
they
generally
ran
backward
after
the
manner
of
micmac
which
is
as
highly
inflected
as
greek
or
hebrew
for
the
admiring
matt
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
romance
about
the
red
man
which
extended
even
to
the
red
boy
and
he
had
set
himself
to
win
heart
in
exchange
for
tobacco
which
was
itself
obtained
by
another
piece
of
barter
tommy
smoked
a
clay
pipe
being
early
indurated
to
hardship
after
the
spartan
custom
of
his
tribe
there
were
sketches
of
tommy
colored
like
the
red
sea
or
the
bay
of
fundy
in
secret
gallery
tommy
was
easy
to
do
owing
to
his
other
tribal
habit
of
sitting
silent
for
hours
without
moving
a
muscle
it
was
only
rarely
that
matt
could
extract
from
him
native
legends
about
glooscap
the
national
hero
and
mundu
the
devil
the
two
boys
set
out
together
for
a
district
five
miles
off
drawing
their
impedimenta
heaped
high
on
a
large
sled
they
were
fortified
for
a
three
stay
strang
had
baked
them
several
batches
of
bread
and
with
unwonted
enthusiasm
supplied
them
with
for
porridge
and
tea
and
sugar
and
butter
and
molasses
and
salt
pork
and
beef
all
stowed
into
the
barrel
that
would
come
home
full
of
sugar
their
kitchen
paraphernalia
embraced
a
teapot
and
a
teakettle
a
and
a
pot
while
their
manufacturing
apparatus
comprised
tin
pails
yankee
buckets
dippers
and
axes
guns
ammunition
and
blankets
completed
their
equipment
painting
materials
were
stowed
away
on
his
person
unobtrusively
they
took
possession
of
a
disused
formerly
the
property
of
a
woodsman
as
the
advertising
agent
would
have
put
it
had
he
penetrated
to
the
backwoods
possibly
under
his
roseate
vision
it
might
have
expanded
into
a
detached
villa
without
basement
or
a
bungalow
standing
in
its
own
grounds
but
a
eye
would
have
seen
nothing
but
four
walls
and
a
pitched
roof
with
a
great
square
hole
in
it
to
let
the
light
in
and
the
smoke
out
these
walls
were
built
of
unhewn
logs
in
their
rough
natural
bark
the
floor
was
even
more
primitive
being
simply
the
soil
it
was
necessary
to
thaw
it
by
lighting
the
fire
on
it
before
the
stakes
could
be
driven
in
to
support
the
from
which
the
depended
then
the
boys
chopped
down
a
vast
store
of
hardwood
for
fuel
and
lanced
the
tall
maples
catching
their
blood
in
troughs
through
pine
spills
they
emptied
the
troughs
into
pails
and
carried
the
sap
to
their
cabin
and
boiled
it
in
the
big
pot
and
cooled
it
again
to
sugar
a
halcyon
fortnight
passed
full
of
work
yet
leaving
matt
leisure
for
daubing
boyish
fancies
on
pieces
of
to
cover
withal
the
wooden
walls
of
his
home
which
the
aforesaid
advertiser
might
not
unwarrantably
have
described
as
a
studio
with
a
novel
in
a
quiet
neighborhood
possibly
mural
decorations
would
have
enhanced
the
description
they
comprised
a
fantastic
medley
of
angels
with
faces
more
or
less
like
ruth
hailey
and
devils
fashioned
more
or
less
after
the
similitude
of
bully
preep
and
strange
composite
animals
more
or
less
like
nothing
on
earth
moving
amid
hills
and
ships
and
lurid
horizons
one
night
matt
sat
by
the
fire
in
the
centre
of
the
hut
painting
a
more
realistic
picture
and
meditating
a
weeding
of
his
gallery
there
had
been
no
sap
running
that
day
a
sudden
return
of
winter
had
congealed
it
and
so
this
extra
artistic
output
during
the
comparatively
idle
hours
had
almost
exhausted
his
while
he
painted
he
gave
an
eye
to
the
seething
pot
in
which
the
sap
must
change
to
molasses
and
then
thicken
to
maple
syrup
and
then
to
maple
wax
ere
it
was
ladled
into
the
dishes
and
set
to
cool
outside
the
hut
a
piece
of
fat
pork
hanging
from
a
hook
in
the
just
touched
the
surface
of
the
sap
and
prevented
it
from
effervescing
tommy
was
asleep
on
a
heap
of
fir
boughs
in
a
corner
for
the
boys
took
it
in
turn
to
watch
the
pot
and
replenish
the
fire
the
soundness
of
sleep
astonished
matt
for
usually
the
young
micmac
slept
the
sleep
of
the
vigilant
at
the
slightest
unwonted
sound
matt
did
not
know
that
his
ingenious
partner
had
just
completed
the
distillation
of
a
crude
rum
from
a
portion
of
sap
arrested
at
the
molasses
stage
and
that
he
had
imbibed
gloriously
thereof
was
an
inverted
bucket
he
wore
a
fur
cap
with
pendent
earlaps
that
gave
him
an
elderly
appearance
and
his
feet
were
cased
in
moccasins
made
from
the
green
shank
of
a
cow
for
some
time
he
painted
steadily
trying
to
reproduce
the
picturesque
interior
of
the
cabin
with
his
rude
colors
and
brush
the
air
was
warm
and
charged
with
resinous
odors
the
burned
brightly
the
hardwood
flaming
without
snapping
or
crackling
with
only
the
soft
hissing
and
spurting
of
liberated
gases
the
fire
purred
as
if
enjoying
the
warmth
the
yellow
billows
curled
round
the
bulging
bottom
of
the
pot
and
sent
up
delicate
spirals
of
blue
smoke
tinged
below
with
flame
to
mingle
with
the
white
sappy
steam
that
froze
as
soon
as
it
got
outside
and
disentangled
itself
from
the
wood
smoke
by
falling
as
at
moments
when
all
this
smoke
lifted
matt
could
see
the
stars
shining
on
him
through
the
hole
in
the
roof
stainless
and
far
away
in
a
deep
blue
patch
of
heaven
somehow
they
made
him
dissatisfied
with
his
work
they
seemed
like
calm
sovran
eyes
watching
his
puny
efforts
to
reproduce
with
his
pitiable
palette
the
manifold
hues
and
shades
of
the
simple
scene
around
him
the
greasy
copper
of
the
indian
face
glistening
against
the
yellow
blanket
which
covered
him
and
the
boughs
on
which
he
lay
the
motley
firewood
the
dull
brown
tones
of
the
spruce
branches
the
silver
of
birch
the
yellow
of
beech
the
empty
troughs
outside
and
dull
salmon
within
touched
with
tints
of
light
gold
or
gray
why
there
was
a
whole
of
subdued
rich
tints
in
the
moss
alone
the
dead
dry
moss
that
filled
up
the
uneven
rifts
in
the
and
gleamed
with
a
mottle
of
green
and
olive
and
russet
he
threw
down
his
brush
in
despair
longing
for
the
rich
thick
paints
he
vaguely
imagined
his
uncle
in
london
must
have
real
paints
that
did
not
fade
as
his
did
despite
the
gums
he
mixed
experimentally
with
them
pure
reds
and
blues
and
greens
and
yellows
capable
of
giving
real
skies
and
real
grass
and
real
water
and
of
being
mixed
into
every
shade
of
color
the
heart
could
desire
then
he
slipped
out
through
the
door
shutting
it
quickly
to
prevent
the
hut
filling
with
smoke
the
ground
was
white
under
a
brilliant
moon
with
here
and
there
patches
of
silver
that
wellnigh
sparkled
overhead
mystic
rays
of
northern
light
palpitated
across
the
clear
heaven
the
trees
showed
more
sombre
the
birches
and
maples
bare
of
leafage
the
spruces
and
hemlocks
and
all
the
tangled
undergrowth
reduced
to
a
common
gray
in
the
moonlight
here
and
there
a
brown
hummock
stood
solemnly
with
bared
head
and
from
all
this
sleeping
woodland
rose
a
restless
breathing
that
incessant
stir
of
a
vast
alien
life
the
rustle
of
creatures
living
and
moving
and
having
their
being
in
another
world
than
the
human
in
that
dim
remote
teeming
underworld
of
animal
life
with
its
keen
joys
and
transient
pains
and
every
now
and
then
a
definite
sound
disengaged
itself
from
the
immense
murmur
a
chickadee
chirped
a
twittered
a
hooted
a
rabbit
ran
from
the
underwood
as
faintly
distinguishable
from
the
snow
in
his
white
winter
coat
as
he
had
been
from
the
dead
leaves
over
which
he
pattered
in
autumn
in
his
gray
homespun
matt
stood
leaning
against
the
door
absorbed
into
the
multifarious
night
and
hardly
conscious
of
the
cold
then
he
went
in
thrilling
with
vague
sweet
emotion
and
vast
manful
resolutions
that
cast
out
despair
but
he
did
not
take
up
his
brush
again
he
sat
down
before
the
fire
in
dreamy
bliss
all
the
asperities
of
his
existence
softened
by
its
leaping
light
and
even
that
dead
face
of
his
father
thawed
into
the
pleasant
motions
of
life
the
past
shone
through
a
mellow
rosy
mist
and
the
future
was
like
the
scarlet
sunrise
of
the
forest
flaming
from
splendor
to
splendor
a
future
of
artistic
achievement
upon
which
ruth
face
smiled
applause
a
future
of
easy
unsought
riches
which
banished
the
gloom
upon
his
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
caught
sight
of
clay
pipe
fallen
from
his
mouth
on
to
the
blanket
and
an
unforeseen
desire
to
smoke
it
and
put
the
seal
on
this
hour
of
happiness
invaded
the
white
breast
he
rose
and
picked
it
up
it
was
full
of
charred
tobacco
the
craving
to
light
it
and
taste
its
mysterious
joys
grew
stronger
his
mother
had
sternly
forbidden
him
to
smoke
backing
up
her
prohibition
by
the
text
in
revelation
he
opened
the
bottomless
pit
and
there
arose
a
smoke
out
of
the
pit
as
the
smoke
of
a
great
furnace
and
the
sun
and
air
were
darkened
by
reason
of
the
smoke
of
the
but
now
he
remembered
he
had
left
school
he
was
a
man
he
put
the
stem
into
his
mouth
and
plucked
a
brand
from
the
fire
then
stood
for
a
moment
irresolute
he
wondered
if
any
instinct
warned
his
mother
of
what
he
was
doing
and
from
that
thought
it
was
an
easy
transition
to
wondering
what
she
was
doing
his
fancy
saw
her
still
running
backward
and
forward
working
that
great
buzzing
wheel
with
stern
joyless
face
he
put
down
his
pipe
there
was
a
fresh
element
in
his
dreamy
bliss
as
he
resumed
his
seat
before
the
fire
a
sense
of
something
high
and
tranquillizing
like
the
clear
stars
yet
touching
the
spring
of
tears
his
head
drooped
in
the
drowsy
warmth
he
surrendered
himself
to
voluptuous
sadness
and
the
outside
world
grew
faint
and
fading
when
he
looked
up
again
his
heart
almost
ceased
to
beat
at
his
side
loomed
a
strange
female
figure
her
head
covered
with
a
drab
shawl
that
hid
her
face
she
stood
in
great
as
on
a
pair
of
pedestals
and
the
log
walls
repeated
her
form
in
contorted
shadow
the
gentle
purring
of
the
fire
the
indian
breathing
sounded
painfully
in
the
weird
stillness
from
without
came
the
manifold
rustle
of
the
night
are
you
he
whispered
me
a
glass
of
water
she
replied
sweetly
any
water
he
breathed
am
afire
with
thirst
she
cried
me
quench
me
her
shawl
slipped
back
revealing
a
face
of
wild
uncanny
beauty
crowned
with
an
aureola
of
golden
hair
but
the
awesome
thrill
that
had
permeated
being
passed
into
one
of
æsthetic
pleasure
mingled
with
astonished
recognition
mad
peggy
he
murmured
the
assented
the
beautiful
visitor
in
soft
musical
tones
thereupon
crying
out
water
for
sake
any
water
i
tell
you
not
till
i
git
some
from
the
spring
in
the
hev
some
sap
and
matt
starting
to
his
feet
plunged
the
dipper
into
the
barrel
of
raw
sap
that
stood
on
the
floor
mad
peggy
seized
it
greedily
and
drained
the
great
ladle
to
the
dregs
then
she
filled
it
again
with
delicious
fluid
and
then
again
and
yet
again
leaving
matt
aghast
at
her
gigantic
capacity
she
was
filling
the
dipper
a
fourth
time
but
he
pulled
it
out
of
her
hand
fearing
she
would
do
herself
a
mischief
so
thirsty
she
whispered
plaintively
in
her
musical
accents
are
you
in
the
woods
at
this
hour
answered
matt
sternly
looking
for
peter
what
a
bonny
fire
and
she
bent
over
it
holding
out
her
long
white
hands
to
the
flames
matt
divined
vaguely
that
peter
must
be
the
sweetheart
whose
desertion
had
crazed
the
poor
creature
it
was
reported
in
cobequid
village
that
the
handsome
german
immigrant
who
had
been
betrothed
to
her
had
gone
off
forever
on
the
pretext
of
when
he
learned
that
she
was
one
of
the
the
unhappy
family
whose
ancestor
had
refused
a
cup
of
cold
water
to
a
strange
old
woman
who
thereupon
put
the
curse
upon
him
and
his
descendants
that
they
illustration
am
afire
with
thirst
she
might
drink
water
and
drink
water
and
never
quench
their
thirst
peggy
was
reputed
quite
harmless
seen
peter
have
you
she
cooed
suddenly
replied
matt
with
a
fresh
nervous
thrill
this
is
not
a
night
for
you
to
be
out
and
about
bitter
bitter
cold
she
repeated
cold
for
an
old
man
like
you
but
not
for
a
girl
like
me
loved
by
the
handsomest
young
fellow
in
the
province
the
heart
within
me
keeps
me
warm
always
warm
and
thirsty

me
more
hed
said
matt
a
shame

folks

arter

up
at
the
ball

heartless
creatures
but
i
saw
the
weddings

of
them
in
spite
of
them
all
and
i
think
high
time
peter
came
back
from
the
sugaring
to
wedding
and
come
to
tell
him

is
the
spot

used
to
sugar
at

partner

she
wound
up
cajolingly
turning
her
lovely
face
towards
his
troubled
gaze

replied

boy

shawl

the
matt
felt
the
moisture
gathering
afresh
under
his
eyelids
your
name
then
she
went
on
sweetly
he
murmured
mad
she
cried
in
ecstasy

knew
it
what
they
call
her
wild
eyes
shone
in
the
firelight
the
boy
shuddered
mad

corrected
her

protested
feebly

cried
passionately

face
and
yet

a
cup
of

the
boy
soothingly
what

exclaimed

sight
of
the
wall
decorations

the
bridegrooms

matt
piqued
into
curiosity
there
he
is
there
is
the
boy
she
pointed
to
the
best
portrait
of
bully
preep
always
called
after
me
the
little
heart
beat
excitedly
his
face
crimsoned
but
his
strange
next
words
threw
him
back
into
uneasy
chaos
but
everybody
is
saying
how
scandalous
it
is
with
his
wife
only
six
months
in
her
grave
look
how
long

give

some
more
this
time
matt
surrendered
the
dipper
to
her
you
cousin
matt
she
said
and
drank
feverishly
but
seeing
that
she
was
about
to
dip
again
he
placed
himself
between
her
and
the
barrel
she
turned
away
with
a
marvellously
dexterous
movement
considering
her
cumbrous
and
dipped
the
ladle
into
the
seething
caldron
instead
but
matt
seized
her
arm
and
stayed
her
from
extracting
the
dipper
scald
yourself
he
said
go

arm
she
cried
threateningly
dare

touch
me

cruel

there
perhaps

will
wake
him

will
give
me
water
i
am
so
she
moaned
and
crooned
over
the
caldron
stirring
the
sap
feebly
with
the
ladle
in
her
efforts
to
wrest
herself
free
and
the
white
steam
curled
about
her
face
and
gave
her
the
air
of
a
young
beautiful
witch
bent
over
a
caldron
matt
forgot
everything
except
that
he
would
like
to
make
a
picture
of
her
as
she
appeared
now
best
go
to
sleep
he
said
at
last
awakening
to
a
remembrance
of
the
strange
situation

bed
those
you
kin
lie
down
there
till
the
and
cover
you
with
my
want
water
she
crooned
get
it
said
matt
may
the
curse
light
on
you
and
yours
she
cried
stirring
the
sap
more
fiercely
in
her
struggle
while
the
vapor
and
the
wood
smoke
rose
in
denser
volumes
around
her
you
thirst
and
thirst
and
never
be
satisfied
and
that
is
to
be
your
fate
cousin
matt
i
read
it
in
your
face
in
your
eyes
never
to
quench
your
thirst

and

and
thirst

never

be
satisfied
never
to
have
anything

matt
and
mad
peggy
cousins

and
i
ha
ha
ha
her
laugh
of
malicious
glee
made
the
blood
run
cold
from
without
came
the
answering
screech
of
a
down
and
rest
repeated
matt
imperatively
stay
here
with
you
no
no
no
cousin
matt
i
know
what
you
want
you
want
to
paint
me
and
put

on
the
wall
among
the
devils
no
no
i
must
be
off
to
find
peter
i
shall
stay
with
him
in
his
her
grip
of
the
dipper
relaxed
it
reeled
against
the
side
of
the
pot
she
turned
away
and
matt
let
go
her
arm
and
watched
her
spellbound
she
drew
the
thick
dun
shawl
over
her
head
again
veiling
the
glory
of
the
golden
hair
and
almost
brought
the
edges
together
over
her
sad
beautiful
face
so
that
the
eyes
alone
shone
out
with
unearthly
radiance
then
she
moved
slowly
towards
the
door
and
thrust
it
open
and
the
wind
came
in
and
filled
the
entire
cabin
with
heavy
acrid
smoke
which
got
into
eyes
and
throat
and
woke
even
the
indian
boy
who
sat
up
choking
and
rubbing
his
black
beady
eyes
door
shuttum
he
cried
with
unusual
vehemence
the
words
broke
spell
he
rushed
to
the
door
but
his
smarting
eyes
could
detect
no
figure
gliding
among
the
gray
trunks
he
closed
the
door
wondering
if
he
had
been
dreaming
your
turn
yet
tommy
he
said
waving
away
the
smoke
with
his
hand
and
tommy
fell
back
asleep
as
if
mesmerized
matt
was
as
relieved
at
not
having
to
explain
as
at
momentary
wakefulness
which
had
braced
him
against
the
superstitious
awe
that
had
been
invading
him
while
the
mad
beauty
cursed
him
with
that
sweet
voice
of
hers
that
no
anger
could
make
harsh
he
thought
of
the
apparition
with
pity
mingled
with
a
thrill
of
solemn
adoration
she
had
for
him
the
beauty
and
wildness
of
the
elemental
like
the
sky
or
the
sea
and
yet
she
had
left
in
him
other
feelings
not
only
the
doubt
of
her
reality
but
an
uneasy
stirring
of
apprehensions
was
there
nothing
but
insane
babble
in
this
talk
of
ruth
hailey
and
abner
preep
a
fear
he
could
not
define
weighed
at
his
heart
even
if
he
had
been
dreaming
if
he
had
drowsed
over
the
fire
as
he
must
in
any
case
have
done
not
to
have
heard
the
scrape
and
clatter
of
entering
the
dream
portended
something
evil
but
no
it
was
not
a
dream
assuredly
the
sap
in
the
barrel
had
sunk
to
a
lower
level
with
a
new
thought
he
lit
a
resinous
bough
and
slipped
out
quickly
and
examined
the
dry
stiff
snow
the
double
trail
of
departing
was
manifest
meandering
among
the
bark
dishes
and
irregularly
intersecting
the
trail
of
arrival
the
radiant
moonlight
falling
through
the
thin
bare
made
his
torch
superfluous
except
in
the
fuscous
glade
of
leafy
evergreens
along
which
he
followed
the
giant
footmarks
for
some
little
distance
he
paused
leaning
against
a
tall
hemlock
doubt
was
impossible
he
had
really
entertained
a
visitor
not
seldom
in
former
years
had
he
entertained
visitors
who
came
to
camp
out
for
the
night
which
they
made
uproarious
but
never
had
his
hut
sheltered
so
strange
a
guest
he
was
moved
at
the
thought
of
her
drifting
across
the
wastes
of
snow
like
some
fallen
spirit
he
looked
up
and
abstractedly
watched
a
crow
sleeping
with
its
head
under
its
wing
on
the
top
of
the
hemlock
then
his
vision
wandered
to
the
flashing
streamers
of
northern
light
and
higher
still
to
those
keen
depths
of
frosty
sky
where
the
stars
stood
beautiful
and
they
drew
up
his
thoughts
yearningly
to
the
infinite
spaces
something
cried
within
him
for
he
knew
not
what
save
that
it
was
very
great
and
very
majestic
and
very
beautiful
mystically
blending
the
luminousness
of
light
and
color
with
the
scent
of
flowers
and
the
troubled
sweetness
of
music
and
at
the
back
of
his
dim
delicious
craving
for
it
was
a
haunting
certainty
that
he
would
never
reach
up
to
it
never
never
the
prophecy
of
mad
peggy
recurred
to
the
boy
like
a
cutting
blast
of
wind
was
it
true
then
that
he
would
thirst
and
thirst
and
nothing
ever
quench
his
thirst
he
held
up
his
torch
yearningly
to
the
stars
while
the
night
moaned
around
him
and
the
flaring
pinewood
cast
a
grotesque
shadow
of
him
on
the
pure
white
snow
an
uncouth
image
that
danced
and
leered
as
in
mockery
chapter
vi
disillusions
as
soon
as
he
could
get
away
next
morning
matt
drew
on
his
oversocks
and
started
for
home
racked
by
indefinite
fears
he
had
not
troubled
to
rouse
tommy
to
take
his
watch
for
he
knew
he
himself
would
not
sleep
a
wink
and
it
seemed
a
pity
to
disturb
so
deep
and
healthy
a
slumber
so
he
bustled
about
to
blur
his
thoughts
and
had
breakfast
ready
an
hour
after
sunrise
which
his
anxiety
did
not
prevent
him
from
observing
to
see
sky
and
forest
take
fire
in
gradual
glory
was
an
ecstasy
transcending
the
apprehensions
of
the
moment
tommy
had
asked
no
questions
during
the
morning
meal
and
made
no
complaints
about
failure
to
rouse
him
but
on
being
apprised
of
his
intended
journey
he
had
pointed
to
the
scanty
a
reminder
that
had
delayed
matt
by
a
couple
of
hours
spent
in
felling
and
chopping
up
a
straddle
or
two
but
at
last
he
got
away
tommy
undertaking
in
a
minimum
of
monosyllables
to
attend
to
everything
else
matt
felt
afresh
the
strength
and
stability
of
tommy
tommy
was
like
sprat
firm
faithful
and
uninquisitive
he
had
five
miles
of
clogged
walking
before
him
but
he
made
fairly
good
progress
for
he
was
unencumbered
by
having
a
light
step
and
an
instinct
for
hollows
and
drifts
and
his
oversocks
which
reached
beyond
the
knee
kept
out
the
snow
when
he
trod
deep
the
freshness
and
buoyancy
of
the
morning
dispelled
his
alarm
dread
was
impossible
under
that
wonderful
blue
sky
but
as
he
got
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
recesses
under
thick
boughs
that
shut
out
the
living
blue
with
dead
gray
and
took
the
sparkle
out
of
the
snow
his
gloom
returned
and
lasted
till
he
was
nearly
at
his
end
when
the
road
caught
the
sunlight
again
just
as
the
thought
of
home
flooded
his
soul
and
soon
a
bend
brought
the
goal
in
sight
there
it
was
the
dear
old
house
standing
back
from
the
road
in
the
midst
of
its
little
clearing
the
sun
shining
on
its
bleached
clapboards
the
black
standing
out
fantastically
against
the
white
panes
opaque
with
frosty
designs
the
smoke
curled
tranquilly
from
the
chimney
towards
the
overarching
azure
making
the
home
seem
a
living
creature
whose
breath
was
thus
condensed
to
visibility
it
seemed
months
since
he
had
left
it
yet
it
was
absolutely
unchanged
and
then
he
heard
the
cock
crow
from
the
rear
and
his
last
fears
vanished
like
evil
spirits
of
the
night
and
a
wave
of
pleasurable
anticipation
bore
him
to
the
porch
he
opened
the
door
no
one
ever
fastened
doors
by
day
for
burglars
came
only
in
the
milder
form
of
peddlers
and
other
visitors
were
accustomed
to
stable
their
horses
and
take
their
seats
at
the
board
without
ceremony
or
warning
it
was
not
far
from
noon
but
he
heard
no
sounds
about
the
house
except
the
crowing
of
the
cock
which
continued
and
brought
up
to
memory
a
grotesque
and
image
of
his
mother
holding
on
to
the
leg
of
a
soaring
hawk
that
had
picked
up
a
chicken
he
listened
for
the
lowing
of
daisy
then
remembering
she
was
dead
and
salted
he
moved
forward
into
the
passage
but
he
found
nobody
in
the
there
was
not
even
a
fire
the
clumsy
stood
silent
the
table
was
bare
and
tidy
the
chairs
were
neatly
ranged
he
ran
into
the
kitchen
it
radiated
bleaker
desolation
matt
fought
against
the
cold
chill
that
was
gathering
at
his
heart
of
course
there
would
be
nobody
at
home
harriet
was
sewing
somewhere
most
of
the
children
were
at
school
and
his
mother
instead
of
leaving
the
baby
in
the
kitchen
with
one
of
them
must
have
taken
it
with
her
to
her
work
and
yet
it
was
all
very
depressing
and
very
disappointing
then
he
remembered
with
a
fresh
shock
the
smoke
he
had
seen
curling
from
the
roof
and
for
an
instant
he
was
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
the
uncanny
an
atmosphere
of
horror
seemed
to
brood
over
the
house
but
the
recollection
of
a
proverb
of
deacon
no
smoke
without
fire
hey
uttered
in
a
moment
of
unusual
articulateness
brought
back
he
ran
up
to
the
bedrooms
but
there
was
not
even
a
stove
except
in
his
room
a
room
tapestried
with
texts
worked
in
berlin
wool
on
perforated
where
the
bed
had
not
been
made
and
where
there
were
traces
of
extinct
logs
immeasurably
puzzled
and
wondering
if
the
smoke
had
been
an
optical
illusion
he
returned
to
the
there
was
only
one
room
he
had
not
gone
into
the
best
room
and
when
he
at
last
recollected
the
existence
of
it
he
did
not
immediately
enter
it
only
visitors
had
the
enjoyment
of
this
room
and
the
privilege
of
sitting
gingerly
on
its
cane
chairs
and
surveying
its
papered
walls
and
in
the
absence
of
the
family
there
could
be
no
reception
in
progress
when
for
the
sake
of
logical
exhaustiveness
he
did
approach
the
door
it
was
listlessly
and
with
a
certain
constraint
amounting
to
awe
his
nostrils
already
scented
the
magnificent
mustiness
of
its
atmosphere
he
opened
the
door
with
noiseless
reverence
then
he
stood
rigid
like
one
turned
to
stone
by
the
sight
of
head
it
was
indeed
a
head
that
petrified
him
or
rather
two
heads
one
pressed
against
the
other
though
he
had
only
a
back
view
of
them
he
knew
them
both
the
lank
black
hair
was
bully
the
long
tresses
were
harriet
a
fire
had
been
lighted
regardless
of
the
polish
of
the
franklin
stove
and
the
severity
of
its
fancy
and
ornamental
urn
and
before
this
fire
his
sister
sat
on
knee
and
abner
sat
on
a
cane
chair
tilting
it
with
a
familiarity
that
hovered
on
contempt
the
treble
shock
was
too
great
matt
was
dumb
and
sick
and
cold
though
thoughts
hurtled
in
his
brain
what
the
skunk
had
sneaked
in
during
his
absence
and
it
was
thus
that
harriet
did
the
honors
he
struggled
to
get
his
voice
back
he
cried
in
raucous
remonstrance
harriet
gave
a
little
shriek
and
turned
her
head
the
color
fled
from
her
soft
cheeks
as
she
caught
sight
of
her
outraged
junior
then
the
blush
returned
in
fuller
crimson
matt
fixed
her
with
a
stern
imperious
eye
are
you
in
the
best
room
was
the
phrase
that
leaped
to
his
angry
lips
abner
turned
on
him
a
face
of
smiling
friendship
best
thing
he
replied
gayly
dare
you
kiss
my
sister
thundered
matt
be
a
fool
matt
said
abner
amiably
your
sister
my
wife
breathed
matt
be
streaked
dear
we
were
married
and
harriet
disentangled
herself
from
abner
and
ran
to
throw
her
arms
round
matt
but
the
boy
repulsed
her
with
a
commanding
gesture
come
near
me
he
cried
huskily
mother
does
she
know
matt
cried
harriet
reproachfully
think
marry
without
her
consent
call
it
rael
mean
anyways
he
cried
tears
of
vexation
getting
into
his
eyes
and
his
voice
take
advantage
of
a
feller
like
that
jest
because
his
turned
we
do
it
agen
cried
abner
with
unshakable
here
matt
and
he
rose
too
revealing
the
slight
tendency
to
crookedness
of
lower
limb
that
offended
the
exigent
eye
of
his
be
pals
you
were
allus
a
spunky
little
chap
and
i
liked
you
from
the
day
you
stood
up
agin
me
and
blacked
my
eye
though
you
had
to
jump
up
to
reach
it
i
was
a
beast
in
them
thar
days
but
i
raelly
now

to
harriet

know
you
like
my
legs
he
added
with
a
flash
of
humor
two
of
two
too
many
you
reptile
retorted
matt
then
turning
to
harriet
he
went
on
in
slow
measured
accents
is
this
chap
to
live
here
is
so
retorted
harriet
said
matt
with
ominous
calm
you

me
here
course
we
said
harriet
with
a
pleasant
laugh
live
with
mother
repeated
matt
staring
down
to
deacon

gone
to
live
to
deacon
he
asked
excitedly
bet
put
in
abner
grinning
genially
altogether
exclaimed
matt
the
world
seemed
going
round
as
it
did
in
the
geography
books
guess
hev
it
cried
matt
agitatedly
hev
her
like
a
nigger
it
was
bad
enough
afore
when
she
hed
to
go
there
every
day
but
now
naught
but
a
servant
a
shame
i
do
declare
you
harriet
he
said
turning
fiercely
on
her
again
you
yourself
mother
out
of
house
and
home
said
harriet
stoutly
the
laughter
that
lurked
about
her
mouth
filled
him
with
a
trembling
presentiment
of
the
truth
you
understand
said
abner
kindly
been
and
gone
and
married
the
deacon
and
a
good
thing
for
all
you
i
do
a
liar
hissed
the
boy
the
world
spun
round
more
fiercely
abner
shrugged
his
shoulders
see
it
was
all
arranged
in
a
hurry
matt
said
harriet
deprecatingly
mother
thought
best
get
it
all
over
so
we
were
both
married
yesterday
we
thought
it
a
pity
to
bother
you
to
come
all
the
way
but
you
finished
hev
you
the
sugar
a
nice
scandal
i
vow
he
cried
furiously
is
come
matt
a
good
un
laughed
abner
heerd
i
returned
matt
with
sullen
mysteriousness
know
thet
everybody
went
there
everybody
said
it
was
a
shame
oh
no
blind
and
deaf
what
i
make
such
a
touse
matt
said
harriet
putting
her
hair
behind
her
ears
with
some
calmness
you
see
things
air
ever
so
much
better
got
a
man
to
support
me
and
she
put
her
arms
lovingly
round
neck
as
if
supporting
him
be
quite
a
lady
not
a
servant
as
you
were
silly
to
allow
you
hev
to
work
so
hard
tell
you
what
matt
you
shall
come
here
sometimes
draw
your
picters
mother
but
matt
clinched
his
teeth
the
bait
was
tempting
but
unfortunately
it
reminded
him
of
his
obedience
to
his
mother
the
night
before
when
in
deference
to
her
views
he
had
denied
himself
the
joy
of
pipe
oh
how
he
had
been
duped
and
bamboozled
at
the
very
hour
his
inner
eye
had
seen
her
toiling
sorrowful
at
her
she
was
frolicking
at
her
in
gay
attire
a
vast
softened
his
indignation
and
raw
misery
he
turned
his
back
on
the
couple
and
strode
from
the
house
lest
they
should
misinterpret
his
tears
but
the
tears
did
not
come
anger
rekindling
evaporated
them
unshed
what
right
had
the
deacon
to
steal
his
mother
without
even
asking
him
and
how
ignoble
of
his
mother
to
forget
his
father
thus
he
figured
ruth
hailey
replacing
himself
by
another
boy
merely
because
he
was
dead
it
seemed
sacrilege
and
yet
no
doubt
ruth
was
as
bad
as
the
rest
of
her
sex
had
she
not
submitted
tamely
to
the
supplanting
of
her
dead
mother
nay
was
she
not
a
necessary
accomplice
in
the
conspiracy
to
keep
him
ignorant
of
the
double
marriage
then
he
had
a
vague
remembrance
that
he
had
once
heard
she
was
not
originally
the
daughter
but
only
the
late
which
somehow
seemed
to
exonerate
her
from
the
full
burden
of
his
doings
still
she
had
unquestionably
been
sly
his
feet
had
turned
instinctively
back
towards
the
lonely
forest
no
he
would
not
go
and
live
with
the
deacon
not
even
though
it
brought
ruth
within
daily
proximity
his
attitude
towards
the
deacon
had
never
been
cordial
nay
the
auditory
strain
upon
him
when
spoke
to
him
had
gone
far
towards
making
him
antipathetic
it
seemed
monstrous
that
such
an
old
mumbler
should
have
been
deemed
fit
to
replace
the
cheery
sailor
who
had
gone
down
wrapped
in
his
flag
no
matt
at
least
would
have
none
of
him
life
under
his
roof
would
be
a
discord
of
jarring
memories
he
would
go
back
to
his
hut
and
live
in
the
wood
he
would
shoot
enough
to
live
upon
and
there
alone
and
and
free
as
its
denizens
he
would
pass
his
life
painting
and
sketching
or
if
he
wanted
society
he
would
seek
that
of
the
indian
the
simple
noble
indian
and
pitch
his
lot
with
his
for
a
time
or
forever
or
perhaps
tommy
would
stay
with
him
tommy
who
was
deep
without
being
wily
and
restful
without
being
dull
what
a
pity
billy
was
disabled
they
might
have
seceded
together
but
fate
had
separated
them
not
his
will
the
five
miles
were
longer
now
and
the
sky
had
grown
a
shade
colder
but
he
trod
the
gloomiest
paths
unchilled
his
heart
was
hot
with
revolt
as
he
came
to
the
little
open
space
round
the
hut
a
curious
phenomenon
arrested
his
attention
there
was
no
smoke
curling
above
the
a
problem
the
exact
reverse
of
that
which
had
greeted
him
at
the
other
terminus
of
his
journey
clamored
for
solution
surely
tommy
had
not
let
the
fire
go
out
he
hastened
his
steps
and
saw
that
the
door
stood
wide
open
on
its
leather
hinges
projecting
outwards
into
the
forest
outside
too
empty
troughs
were
scattered
about
in
lieu
of
being
piled
up
neatly
the
air
of
desolation
sobered
him
like
a
cold
douche
he
was
frightened
he
had
not
even
courage
to
dwell
on
the
thought
of
what
foreboding
whispered
but
perhaps
tommy
had
only
gone
to
sleep
again
and
forgotten
about
the
fire
with
a
gleam
of
hope
he
ran
to
the
entrance
then
leaped
back
with
a
wild
thrill
and
slammed
the
door
to
and
put
his
back
to
it
and
stood
palpitating
restrained
only
by
excitement
from
breaking
down
in
childish
tears
the
interior
of
the
hut
had
been
transformed
as
by
enchantment
of
barrels
axes
ironware
provender
even
of
his
rude
paints
there
was
not
a
trace
though
the
picture
exhibition
was
undisturbed
the
were
littered
over
the
floor
there
was
no
tommy
but
in
the
centre
of
the
cabin
where
the
fire
had
been
lay
a
matted
bear
voluptuously
curled
up
on
the
warm
ashes
and
licking
the
mellifluous
soil
which
was
by
drops
that
had
fallen
from
the
the
beautiful
sunshine
had
lured
the
animal
from
its
winter
famished
after
its
long
fast
it
was
a
moment
matt
never
forgot
one
of
those
moments
that
age
and
imbitter
as
he
stood
with
squared
shoulders
against
the
rough
battened
door
that
was
built
of
stout
slabs
he
shook
from
head
to
foot
with
mingled
emotions
numb
misery
alternated
with
burning
flashes
of
righteous
indignation
against
humanity
red
and
white
and
with
it
all
was
a
stirring
of
the
instinct
an
itching
to
shoot
the
creature
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
which
aggravated
his
vexation
by
the
reminder
that
even
his
gun
had
been
stolen
it
eased
him
a
little
to
let
his
mind
dwell
on
the
prospect
of
potting
such
glorious
game
but
first
of
all
he
must
run
tommy
to
earth
tommy
could
not
have
gone
far
burdened
as
he
would
be
with
the
spoil
the
boy
moved
stealthily
from
the
door
and
pushed
up
a
small
trunk
that
he
had
cut
down
that
morning
but
not
yet
chopped
up
with
some
difficulty
he
raised
this
and
propped
it
against
the
door
which
being
already
latched
could
not
easily
be
burst
open
by
the
bear
the
creature
was
moreover
likely
to
resume
its
winter
nap
in
the
snug
sweet
quarters
in
which
it
found
itself
having
thus
trapped
his
bear
matt
started
off
by
a
in
the
direction
of
the
indian
encampment
to
which
he
presumed
tommy
would
naturally
have
returned
but
he
had
not
gone
a
hundred
yards
before
he
called
himself
a
fool
and
ran
back
in
his
agitation
he
had
forgotten
to
note
the
trail
of
the
sled
in
which
tommy
must
have
drawn
off
the
things
this
he
now
discovered
ran
quite
in
the
opposite
direction
and
was
complicated
not
only
by
footmarks
but
by
a
whither
had
tommy
decamped
the
day
seemed
made
up
of
surprises
and
puzzles
however
there
was
everything
to
gain
or
rather
regain
by
following
the
dusky
young
impostor
and
the
accomplice
who
had
helped
him
to
draw
the
heavy
sled
matt
discovered
that
the
trail
led
towards
long
village
two
and
a
half
miles
off
and
instantly
it
flashed
upon
him
that
tommy
had
gone
there
to
dispose
of
the
things
he
quickened
his
pace
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
strode
into
a
truer
solution
of
the
mystery
for
suddenly
he
found
himself
amid
dogs
grubbing
in
the
sunshine
and
swaddled
pappooses
swinging
on
the
poles
of
wigwams
and
perceived
that
the
vagrant
micmacs
had
shifted
their
encampment
during
the
fortnight
knowledge
of
the
migration
argued
secret
correspondence
unless
a
tribal
tempter
had
visited
him
accidentally
during
absence
which
seemed
rather
improbable
soul
was
aflame
with
wrath
and
resentment
he
rushed
about
among
the
wigwams
unceremoniously
peering
behind
the
blankets
that
overhung
the
doorways
which
were
partly
blocked
by
spruce
boughs
arranged
to
spring
back
and
forth
dumpy
men
with
complexions
of
grayish
copper
squatting
on
fir
boughs
before
the
central
fire
smoked
on
unresentful
a
few
ejaculating
sullenly
pawotumun
is
your
wish
their
faces
had
nothing
of
the
american
they
would
have
been
round
but
for
the
angularity
of
the
jaw
and
chinese
but
for
the
eyes
which
did
not
slant
upward
but
were
beady
and
wide
apart
the
were
high
the
nose
was
of
a
negro
flatness
and
the
straight
black
hair
was
long
and
matted
in
attire
the
men
had
an
air
of
shabby
civilization
which
went
ill
with
the
blankets
and
skins
overwrapping
the
white
leavings
near
the
door
in
the
quarter
of
less
distinction
sitting
with
feet
twisted
round
to
one
side
one
under
the
other
as
befits
the
inferior
sex
were
women
but
greasy
who
wore
shawls
and
blankets
over
their
kerchiefed
heads
and
necklaces
of
blue
beads
twinkling
against
their
olive
throats
and
smoked
as
gravely
as
their
lords
but
tommy
was
invisible
nor
could
matt
see
anything
of
the
stolen
goods
but
in
one
tent
he
found
father
and
discourteously
omitting
the
of
greeting
plied
him
with
indignant
questions
in
a
mixture
of
bad
english
and
worse
indian
father
understood
little
and
knew
nothing
he
did
not
invite
the
visitor
into
the
tent
but
smoked
on
peacefully
and
whittled
a
shaving
and
admiration
of
the
red
taciturnity
died
a
painful
death
had
father
not
even
seen
tommy
no
father
had
not
seen
tommy
for
half
a
moon
and
the
smoke
curled
peacefully
round
greasy
head
never
had
the
unspeakable
uncleanliness
of
the
picturesque
figure
struck
matt
as
it
did
now
he
moved
away
with
heavy
heart
and
heavy
footstep
and
interviewed
other
indians
equally
dingy
and
equally
reticent
even
the
squaws
kept
the
secret
matt
went
back
in
despairing
anger
and
poured
out
his
passion
in
a
flood
of
remonstrance
upon
the
unwashed
head
of
father
he
pointed
to
the
trail
of
the
sled
that
drew
up
at
tent
he
reasoned
he
threatened
he
clinched
his
fist
and
stamped
his
foot
and
father
smoked
the
pipe
of
peace
and
whittled
the
shaving
the
indian
held
the
stick
on
his
knee
and
drew
the
knife
towards
himself
unlike
the
white
man
who
cuts
away
from
himself
it
was
a
crooked
knife
with
a
notch
for
the
thumb
in
the
handle
spirit
oozed
away
before
its
imperturbable
movement
to
and
fro
he
felt
sick
and
faint
he
became
vaguely
conscious
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
breakfast
then
he
remembered
the
bear
waiting
in
the
cabin
waiting
to
be
killed
with
a
happy
thought
he
informed
father
that
he
had
trapped
a
bear
and
could
conduct
him
to
the
spot
and
father
instantly
began
to
understand
him
better
and
when
matt
proceeded
to
offer
him
the
beast
in
exchange
for
the
stolen
goods
the
micmac
betrayed
a
complete
comprehension
of
the
offer
and
with
a
courteous
exclamation
of
invited
him
into
the
furthermost
and
most
honorable
portion
of
the
tent
he
even
rose
and
held
colloquy
with
some
of
his
brethren
gathered
round
a
bear
was
a
valuable
property
dead
his
snout
alone
was
worth
five
dollars
when
presented
as
a
death
certificate
to
a
grateful
government
anxious
to
extinguish
him
these
five
dollars
were
a
great
consideration
to
a
tribe
paid
mainly
in
kind
and
hard
pushed
to
find
coin
for
the
annual
remission
of
sin
at
the
hands
of
the
priests
the
skin
would
fetch
four
or
five
dollars
more
while
its
three
or
four
hundred
pounds
of
flesh
would
set
up
the
larder
for
the
season
as
a
result
of
the
native
council
father
informed
matt
that
he
had
just
learned
tommy
had
been
seen
that
morning
but
that
he
had
hauled
the
sled
past
the
encampment
on
his
way
to
long
village
to
sell
the
freight
which
nobody
had
suspected
was
not
his
own
property
the
much
dam
thief
he
had
however
left
a
gun
with
a
boy
friend
and
if
matt
was
content
to
swop
the
bear
for
this
he
could
have
it
matt
fuming
at
his
own
helplessness
consented
the
gun
was
accordingly
produced
matt
recognized
his
old
friend
but
father
explained
in
easy
pantomime
that
when
bear
was
dead
boy
would
get
gun
and
not
before
and
he
handed
it
to
a
blanketless
who
had
evidently
bartered
external
heat
for
internal
then
shouldering
his
own
gun
he
motioned
to
matt
to
lead
the
way
the
little
procession
of
three
set
forth
the
second
indian
prudently
providing
himself
with
a
flat
wide
sledge
the
afternoon
was
waning
the
blue
overhead
had
lost
in
luminousness
leaving
the
coloring
of
the
earth
more
vivid
but
the
shifting
of
kaleidoscope
had
ceased
to
interest
matt
humanity
occupied
him
exclusively
and
the
evil
that
was
done
under
the
sun
man
or
woman
white
or
red
they
were
all
alike
a
skulking
shifty
breed
it
was
not
only
he
that
had
been
betrayed
it
was
truth
it
was
honor
were
these
things
then
merely
on
their
arrival
at
the
hut
matt
explained
the
position
he
was
about
to
remove
the
log
that
braced
up
the
door
but
father
pulled
him
violently
back
and
gestured
that
it
was
much
more
convenient
to
shoot
the
animal
through
the
matt
felt
a
qualm
of
disgust
and
remorse
it
seemed
cowardly
to
give
the
poor
beast
that
had
taken
refuge
in
his
hut
no
chance
he
leaned
sullenly
against
the
door
feeling
almost
like
one
who
had
betrayed
the
laws
of
hospitality
and
conscious
moreover
of
a
strange
savage
sympathy
with
the
bear
in
its
strife
with
humanity
his
last
respect
for
the
noble
red
man
vanished
when
the
two
micmacs
clambered
upon
the
roof
they
uttered
of
satisfaction
as
they
peeped
over
the
great
square
hole
and
perceived
their
prey
asleep
after
some
amiable
banter
of
the
animal
they
began
to
put
their
guns
into
position
but
father
insisted
on
having
the
glory
of
the
deed
since
he
was
paying
for
the
bear
with
gun
and
his
rival
ungraciously
yielded
in
his
cocksureness
however
father
merely
hit
the
shoulder
the
creature
started
up
with
a
fierce
growl
and
began
biting
savagely
at
the
bleeding
wound
excited
by
his
failure
and
the
leap
up
father
leaned
more
over
the
hole
for
his
second
shot
but
his
companion
exclaiming
that
it
was
his
turn
now
pushed
him
back
and
strove
to
get
his
body
in
front
father
who
was
now
effervescing
with
excitement
thrust
himself
more
forward
still
and
in
his
zeal
succeeded
so
well
that
he
suddenly
found
himself
flying
into
the
hut
while
the
gun
went
off
at
random
the
bullet
missed
but
the
man
struck
the
obfuscated
creature
with
a
thud
ricochetted
off
its
back
and
lay
prostrate
on
the
floor
the
sound
of
the
fall
the
explosion
the
cry
of
dismay
from
the
roof
informed
matt
of
what
had
happened
in
a
flash
his
sympathy
went
back
to
man
he
cried
to
the
other
indian
to
shoot
but
the
arm
was
shaking
and
the
bear
after
a
few
seconds
of
bewilderment
had
risen
on
its
hind
legs
and
stood
over
the
fallen
man
growling
fiercely
so
that
the
micmac
was
afraid
of
hitting
his
friend
matt
reached
up
impatiently
for
his
gun
which
the
micmac
readily
handed
to
him
in
unforeseen
violation
of
orders
and
matt
overthrowing
the
with
the
butt
end
lifted
the
latch
and
dashed
in
father
was
already
in
the
grip
the
infuriated
elastic
beginning
to
press
horribly
upon
his
ribs
matt
clapped
the
barrel
of
the
gun
to
the
ear
then
he
was
overswept
by
a
fearsome
doubt
lest
the
gun
had
been
unloaded
since
it
had
left
his
hands
but
his
suspense
was
short
he
pressed
the
trigger
there
was
a
ringing
explosion
and
the
creature
bounded
into
the
air
relaxing
its
hold
of
the
indian
upon
whom
it
fell
again
in
its
matt
aided
by
the
other
micmac
who
hurried
in
grunting
disentangled
father
from
the
writhing
heap
and
found
him
bruised
and
breathless
but
practically
uninjured
father
vowed
eternal
gratitude
to
his
rescuer
and
said
his
life
was
henceforward
at
disposal
the
boy
curtly
asked
for
his
property
instead
whereupon
the
indian
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
token
of
impotence
rolling
the
bear
over
with
a
prod
of
his
contemptuous
foot
he
produced
his
knife
and
started
scalping
and
skinning
the
dead
enemy
while
his
lit
some
boughs
and
cut
a
juicy
steak
from
the
carcass
and
set
it
to
broil
the
warmth
was
grateful
for
the
shadows
were
fast
gathering
and
the
hyperborean
hours
returning
a
covey
of
whirred
past
and
the
weird
note
of
a
was
borne
on
the
bleak
air
the
indians
offered
the
boy
cut
from
the
joint
and
he
refused
sulkily
a
deadly
insult
in
normal
circumstances
but
the
keen
pangs
of
hunger
and
the
delicious
odor
of
the
meat
weakened
him
and
a
later
invitation
to
join
the
squatting
diners
found
him
ravenously
responsive
though
he
felt
he
had
bartered
away
his
righteous
indignation
for
a
mess
of
pottage
during
the
meal
his
guests
or
his
hosts
he
knew
not
which
they
were
betrayed
considerable
interest
in
his
mural
decorations
which
they
evidently
regarded
as
symptoms
of
a
relapse
from
christianity
and
they
were
astonished
too
at
his
refusal
to
quaff
more
than
a
mouthful
or
two
of
their
rum
the
coarse
concoction
locally
nicknamed
while
matt
who
had
started
last
was
still
eating
from
the
dish
he
had
utilized
for
the
purpose
father
lit
his
pipe
and
having
taken
a
few
whiffs
passed
it
on
to
his
companion
who
in
turn
held
out
to
matt
the
long
reedy
stem
with
its
feather
ornaments
the
offer
sent
a
thrill
through
the
whole
being
all
his
grievances
ascended
afresh
from
the
red
stone
bowl
and
mingled
with
the
fragrant
smoke
how
good
how
obedient
he
had
been
and
all
for
what
a
lump
gathered
in
his
throat
so
that
he
could
not
swallow
his
bit
of
bear
he
nodded
assent
his
heart
throbbing
with
defiant
manhood
and
motioned
to
the
micmac
to
place
the
pipe
beside
his
dish
till
he
was
ready
for
it
the
two
indians
then
hauled
the
carcass
athwart
the
sledge
hastily
for
night
had
come
on
as
though
shed
from
the
starless
sky
and
they
called
to
matt
to
come
along
but
matt
shouted
back
that
he
did
not
intend
to
accompany
them
he
no
longer
craved
to
cast
in
his
lot
with
the
red
man
yet
he
went
to
the
door
of
his
tent
to
watch
his
disappear
among
the
sombre
groves
and
a
deeper
dusk
seemed
to
fall
on
the
landscape
when
the
very
rustle
of
their
passage
died
away
but
as
he
turned
in
again
and
fastened
up
the
door
his
heart
leaped
up
afresh
with
the
leaping
flames
the
sense
of
absolute
solitude
became
exultation
a
keen
bitter
joy
here
was
his
home
he
had
no
other
he
had
parted
company
with
humanity
forever
he
reseated
himself
on
a
little
pile
of
fir
boughs
in
his
deserted
home
that
was
naked
but
for
the
the
least
comforting
of
all
possible
salvage
since
they
were
the
only
things
tommy
had
not
thought
worth
stealing
as
matt
sat
brooding
darker
patches
on
the
soil
and
spots
upon
some
of
those
pictures
caught
his
eye
he
saw
they
were
of
blood
in
one
place
there
was
quite
a
little
pool
which
had
not
yet
sunk
into
the
earth
or
evaporated
he
touched
it
curiously
with
his
finger
and
wiped
away
the
stain
against
a
leaf
then
with
a
sudden
thought
he
curled
a
piece
of
bark
and
scooped
up
the
blood
into
his
birchen
dish
as
a
possible
color
murmuring
gleefully
caught
his
blood
said
the
fish
my
little
dish
i
caught
his
in
moving
the
he
laid
bare
calumet
forgotten
he
took
it
up
how
the
universe
had
changed
since
last
he
held
a
pipe
in
his
hand
only
last
night
again
he
heard
the
howl
of
a
and
he
looked
round
involuntarily
as
if
expecting
to
find
mad
peggy
at
his
elbow
but
he
had
no
sense
of
awe
just
now
though
he
had
barred
his
door
inhospitably
against
further
bears
only
the
voluptuousness
of
liberty
and
loneliness
the
healthy
of
satisfied
appetite
and
the
gayety
born
of
flaming
logs
and
a
couple
of
mouthfuls
of
the
prophecy
seemed
peculiarly
inept
in
view
of
the
pipe
he
held
in
his
hand
with
tremulous
anticipation
of
more
than
mortal
rapture
he
relit
it
the
sensation
was
unexpectedly
pungent
but
matt
puffed
away
steadily
in
hope
and
trust
that
this
was
merely
the
verdict
of
an
unaccustomed
palate
and
he
found
a
vast
compensatory
pleasure
in
his
ability
to
make
the
thing
work
to
send
the
delicate
wreaths
into
the
air
as
ably
as
any
micmac
or
deacon
of
them
all
but
soon
even
this
pleasure
began
to
be
swamped
by
a
wave
of
less
agreeable
sensation
and
matt
puzzled
and
chagrined
after
a
gallant
stand
threw
down
the
calumet
and
hastened
into
the
cold
air
with
palpitating
heart
and
splitting
head
and
there
in
the
maple
wood
bruin
was
avenged
that
night
despite
his
vigil
of
the
night
before
matt
strang
vainly
endeavored
to
close
his
eyes
upon
an
unsatisfactory
world
chapter
vii
the
apprentice
the
long
endless
years
crowded
with
petty
episodes
and
uniformities
and
moving
like
a
cumbrous
creeping
train
that
stops
at
every
station
flash
like
an
express
past
the
eye
of
memory
yet
it
is
these
unrecorded
minutiæ
of
monotonous
months
that
color
the
fabric
of
our
future
lives
eating
into
our
souls
like
a
slow
acid
when
in
after
years
matt
youth
defiled
before
him
the
panorama
seemed
more
varied
than
when
he
was
living
the
scenes
in
all
their
daily
detail
of
dull
routine
and
when
whatever
their
superficial
differences
they
were
all
linked
for
him
by
an
underlying
unity
of
toil
and
aspiration
first
came
his
apprenticeship
in
at
the
opposite
outskirt
of
the
forest
twenty
miles
from
cobequid
for
though
he
early
tired
of
savagery
as
a
on
the
road
to
he
refused
in
the
dogged
pride
of
his
boyish
heart
to
return
to
his
folks
contenting
himself
with
informing
them
of
his
whereabouts
and
of
his
intention
to
apprentice
himself
with
or
without
their
consent
labor
being
so
scarce
that
year
deacon
hailey
drove
over
in
great
haste
to
offer
him
a
loving
home
matt
who
happened
to
be
in
the
house
which
was
only
parted
from
the
by
a
large
saw
through
a
window
the
buggy
arrive
at
the
and
the
deacon
himself
alight
to
open
the
wooden
gate
the
resentment
flamed
afresh
and
it
was
supplemented
by
dread
of
the
inarticulate
conversation
he
fled
to
cattermole
in
the
kitchen
she
was
a
shrewish
angular
person
economical
of
everything
save
angry
breath
a
black
silk
cap
with
prim
bows
and
ribbons
sat
severely
on
her
head
and
a
confined
her
hair
cattermole
a
simple
religious
creature
had
gone
to

to

joyously
up
to

he
cried

stirring
reminiscences

him
full
split

the
baby
young
man
there
be
no
touse
at
all
he
set
foot
in
my
kitchen
and
an
end
of
cattermole
greeted
the
deacon
politely
and
informed
him
that
the
lad
he
was
inquiring
after
was
sulking
in
the
kitchen
and
that
he
refused
to
receive
his
visitor
on
any
account
the
deacon
sighed
unctuously
with
an
air
of
patient
martyrdom
obduracy
heightened
his
estimate
of
the
value
as
a
gratuitous
and
sharpened
his
sense
of
being
robbed
of
what
small
dowry
strang
had
brought
him
boy
is
dreadful
set
agin
me
he
complained
es
i
told
his
poor

and
a
heathen
on

cattermole
assented
amiably
to

a

hey
i
reckon

wait
in

kitchen
give
the
mare
a
rest
if

a
reason
my

nag
should

cattermole
seeing
the
outworks
taken
directed
the
deacon
by
a
flank
movement
into
the
parlor
as
alone
befitting
his
dignity
to
matt
this
parlor
far
finer
than
the
best
room
at
home
was
a
chamber
of
awe
but
also
of
attraction
for
its
walls
were
hung
with
sober
bible
prints
cattermole
stood
there
among
her
splendors
with
her
back
to
the
door
partly
for
defensive
purposes
partly
so
as
not
to
depreciate
one
of
the
chairs
by
sitting
down
it
was
enough
for
one
day
that
her
guest
sat
solidly
on
the
of

much
soft

cattermole
arter
all
thet
heavy
afeard

responded
cattermole
gloomily
they
discussed
the
disastrous
thaw
of
a
few
years
back
with
a
vivid
remembrance
of
the
vegetables
and
dairy
produce
spoiled
in
the
flooded
cellars

cattermole
shook
her
head
in
sad
acquiescence

only
safe
place

astonished
accents

his
ears

pursed
his
lips

happiness
no
no
sonny
if
money
was
any
use
my
poor
susan
would
hev
been
alive
to
this
day
know
better
when
my
he
spat
out
now
directing
the
stream
into
the
sink
under
the
big
wooden
pump
worry
him
interposed
cattermole
the
deacon
hailey
waved
a
rebuking
palm
afore
pleasure
cattermole
see
here
sonny
been
with
cattermole
you
promised
me
to
be
a
mother
to
you
heaven
bless
her
but
i
forget
got
a
mother
your
my
mother
now
mother
said
matt
half
divining
the
mumble
of
words
mother
to
both
you
a
large
heart
what
got
if
mother
then
your
father
hey
it
right
of
you
to
disobey
your
father
and
mother
but
young
folks
nowadays
treats
the
commandments
like
old
boots
and
the
deacon
sighed
as
if
in
sympathy
with
the
sorrows
of
a
neglected
decalogue
got
no
father
no
mother
said
matt
to
be
a
soon
es
i
kin
i
do
else
flat
when
bigger
to
write
to
my
uncle
matt
and
see
if
he
kin
sell
my
pictures
fur
me
if
you
was
to
drag
me
back
by
force
escape
into
the
woods
work
my
way
to
london
to
be
handy
my
uncle
matt
i
reckon
he
takes
in
same
es
the
boss
here
so
you
jest
tell
my
mother
done
with
her
see
i
want
to
hear
any
more
his
face
resumed
its
set
expression
and
his
rocking
foot
its
violence
the
deacon
cast
a
reproachful
irate
glance
at
cattermole
i
tell
you
a
lie
when
i
said
he
worth
thet
thar
he
vociferated
snatching
the
tin
dipper
from
the
the
noise
disturbed
the
baby
which
began
to
whimper
feebly
matt
turned
his
back
on
the
deacon
and
gazed
studiously
towards
the
in
the
yard
the
face
grew
apoplectic
he
seemed
about
to
throw
the
dipper
at
the
back
of
head
but
mastering
himself
he
let
it
fall
with
a
splash
and
said
quietly
guess
you
hev
me
to
blame
if
he
turns
out
all
belly
no
some
say
you
a
smart
likely
young
man
with
his
heart
in
the
but
not
deacon
way
he
makes
a
pint
of
the
bad
pints
a
man
you
could
swap
a
horse
with
hey
i
tell
you
cattermole
thet
durned
boy
is
all
moonshine
viciousness
stuffed
with
conceit
from
floor
to
picters
picters
picters
is
all
he
thinks
about
himself
his
idee
of
life
in
this
vale
of
tears
i
reckon
he
thinks
to
strike
captain
treasure
but
arter
all
he
burden
giv
his
poor
mother
a
home
i
the
man
to
grudge
bite
sup
to
her
boy
so
even
now
i
mind
you
off
my
crost
and
got
to
bear
him
no
use
a
christian
only
in
church
hey
guess
a
christian
too
said
cattermole
i
must
bear
with
the
poor
lad
train
him
up
some
in
the
way
he
should
go
then
father
a
rael
saint
deacon
but
i
sorter
think
where
heaven
is
consarned
father
like
a
es
well
so
say
no
more
it
now
then
deacon
the
he
ignored
the
patient
piece
of
furniture
blame
me
any
if
the
buckwheat
turns
out
bad
he
shouted
losing
his
again
and
spurting
out
his
nicotian
fluid
at
the
stove
like
an
angry
so
acquiesced
cattermole
quietly
then
deacon
hailey
jest
you
set
she
had
taken
a
chair
and
placed
her
hands
on
the
table
said
the
deacon

deacon
hailey

christian

and
very
solemnly
he
strode
without
cattermole
lifted
her
hands
and
brought
them
down
again
on
the
table
with
a
thump
tarnation
ole
fox
she
cried
to
bamboozle
me
with
tales
tables
likely
es
a
table
is
to
dance
of
itself
tell
me
sickness
jest
you
come
here
matt
lay
your
hands
alongside
mine
thet
for
matt
had
begun
pensively
adorning
the
hood
of
the
cradle
by
means
of
a
burned
stick
he
had
pulled
from
the
stove
ole
hey
he
said
reddening
you
leave
off
fun
your
elders
betters
she
said
sharply
be
plenty
of
work
fur
you
in
the
there
was
plenty
of
work
matt
found
in
numerous
other
directions
too
many
more
things
than
mechanical
did
the
boy
practise
at
to
begin
with
apprehensions
were
justified
and
the
spring
freshets
swept
away
the
dam
and
so
matt
was
set
to
work
hauling
brushwood
and
gravel
and
logs
to
build
up
a
kind
of
cattermole
was
really
a
and
so
matt
acquired
decoration
and
his
farming
and
experience
was
also
considerably
enlarged
he
milked
the
cows
looked
after
four
driven
by
brother
and
sheep
cut
firewood
cleared
out
barns
turned
churns
hoed
potatoes
mowed
hay
fed
fowls
and
pigs
and
rocked
the
cradle
and
in
the
interval
of
running
the
circular
and
saws
in
the
mill
worked
in
the
at
the
back
graining
and
scrolling
the
furniture
and
ornamenting
it
with
roses
and
other
gorgeous
flowers
sometimes
even
with
landscapes
this
was
his
only
opportunity
of
making
pictures
for
recreation
hours
he
had
none
he
rose
at
four
in
the
morning
and
went
to
bed
at
ten
at
night
his
wages
were
his
food
and
clothes
both
left
off
cattermole
made
his
garments
out
of
her
wardrobe
itself
of
gray
homespun
but
the
hours
in
the
threw
their
aroma
over
all
the
others
and
made
them
livable
and
cattermole
though
a
hard
was
not
a
harsh
taskmaster
and
had
gentle
flashes
of
jest
when
cattermole
was
out
of
and
though
winter
was
long
yet
there
were
seasons
of
delicious
sunshine
when
the
blueberries
ripened
on
the
flats
or
the
apples
waxed
rosy
in
the
orchard
when
the
air
thrilled
with
the
song
of
birds
and
the
dawn
was
golden
in
one
of
these
seasons
of
hope
he
wrote
to
his
uncle
of
his
death
and
his
own
existence
and
cattermole
paid
the
postage
an
ingenuous
letter
full
of
the
pathetic
almost
incredible
ignorance
of
obscure
and
sequestered
youth
and
inquiring
what
chances
there
would
be
for
him
to
reap
fortune
by
painting
pictures
in
london
he
addressed
the
letter
with
vague
recollection
of
something
in
his
school
to
matthew
strang
painter
national
gallery
london
it
was
not
an
letter
nor
an
here
and
there
the
orthography
was
original
but
in
the
main
mctavit
had
been
not
ineffectual
and
there
were
fewer
traces
of
illiteracy
about
the
epistle
than
might
have
been
imagined
from
talk
but
in
mind
the
written
and
the
spoken
were
kept
as
distinct
as
printed
type
and
the
manuscript
alphabet
they
ran
on
parallel
lines
that
never
met
and
that
should
be
spelled
seemed
no
more
contradictory
than
that
should
be
spelled
the
grammar
he
had
used
in
scholastic
exercises
was
not
for
everyday
wear
it
was
of
a
ceremonious
dignity
that
suited
with
the
stateliness
of
epistolary
communication
alas
for
all
the
carefulness
of
the
composition
his
uncle
of
the
national
gallery
gave
no
sign
suspense
and
sorrow
dwindled
at
last
into
resignation
for
he
had
come
to
a
renewed
sense
of
religion
as
strang
would
have
put
it
he
had
found
grace
there
were
a
few
pious
books
and
tracts
about
the
cattermole
establishment
to
devour
in
stolen
snatches
or
by
bartering
sleep
for
reading
and
among
these
dusty
treasures
he
lighted
on
with
quaint
in
the
moral
fervor
with
which
the
dramatic
allegory
informed
him
matt
felt
wickedness
an
impossibility
henceforward
his
future
life
stretched
before
him
white
fleckless
unstainable
meanness
or
falsehood
or
viciousness
could
never
touch
his
soul
how
curiously
people
must
be
constituted
who
could
knowingly
prefer
evil
when
good
thrilled
one
with
such
rapture
bathed
one
in
such
peace
already
he
felt
the
beatitude
of
the
new
jerusalem
the
pictures
he
painted
should
be
please
god
they
should
exhibit
the
baseness
of
mr
worldly
wiseman
castigate
the
town
of
carnal
policy
he
would
uplift
the
eyes
of
the
wicked
to
the
contemplation
of
the
shining
ones
though
after
all
he
began
to
ask
himself
could
any
picture
equal
book
was
not
a
book
immeasurably
the
better
medium
of
expression
the
suspicion
was
strengthened
by
the
reading
of
a
dime
novel
which
his
brother
the
had
left
lying
about
it
was
the
first
unadulterated
novel
he
had
read
and
the
sensational
episodes
stirred
his
blood
his
religious
enthusiasm
died
he
loved
mike
the
who
was
the
hero
of
the
novel
action
strong
action
a
big
personality
there
lay
the
admirable
in
life
the
christians
and
hopefuls
were
figures
after
all
and
unreal
at
that
in
actual
life
one
only
came
across
mimics
who
used
their
language
the
deacon
haileys
or
the
abner
preeps
to
whom
even
thieving
tommy
were
preferable
no
wonder
mike
had
been
driven
to
what
a
pity
he
himself
had
not
remained
in
his
forest
hut
rebel
against
humanity
king
of
the
woods
ah
and
how
inadequate
was
paint
to
express
the
fulness
of
life
the
medium
was
too
childishly
simple
at
most
one
could
fix
a
single
scene
a
single
incident
and
that
only
in
its
outside
aspect
books
palpitated
with
motion
and
emotion
he
set
to
work
to
write
a
dime
novel
stealing
an
hour
from
his
scanty
night
he
made
but
slow
progress
though
he
began
with
an
exciting
episode
about
a
white
boy
besieged
in
his
by
a
party
of
indians
and
saved
by
the
sudden
advent
of
a
couple
of
bears
the
words
he
wrote
down
seemed
a
paltry
rendition
of
his
thought
and
inner
vision
they
were
tame
and
scant
of
syllable
he
discovered
that
his
literary
palette
was
even
more
pitiful
than
his
pictorial
still
he
labored
on
for
the
goal
was
grand
and
despite
his
mental
divorce
between
pronunciation
and
orthography
his
spoken
english
improved
imperceptibly
through
all
this
contact
with
literature
then
one
wonderful
day
to
be
marked
with
a
white
stone
and
yet
also
with
a
black
he
received
a
letter
from
england
all
his
artistic
ambition
flamed
up
furiously
again
as
he
broke
the
seal
london
club
dear
nephew
your
letter
gave
me
mingled
pain
and
pleasure
i
was
deeply
grieved
to
hear
of
the
sad
death
of
your
dear
father
my
poor
brother
had
not
written
to
me
nor
had
i
seen
him
since
his
marriage
but
i
knew
i
should
somehow
hear
of
it
if
anything
went
wrong
with
him
i
am
shocked
to
have
remained
ignorant
for
so
many
months
after
his
death
i
really
think
your
mother
should
have
let
me
know
as
she
could
have
discovered
my
address
through
my
relatives
who
live
in
halifax
however
i
hope
god
has
given
her
strength
to
bear
the
blow
and
now
my
dear
matthew
let
me
tell
you
your
letter
is
very
childish
and
not
what
i
should
have
expected
of
a
young
man
of
fourteen
as
you
describe
yourself
it
is
very
nice
to
amuse
yourself
by
painting
pictures
it
keeps
you
out
of
mischief
but
how
can
you
fancy
that
your
pictures
are
worth
any
money
why
painting
is
the
most
difficult
of
all
the
arts
it
requires
years
and
years
of
study
under
great
masters
and
it
costs
a
heap
of
money
to
pay
models
that
is
men
or
women
who
sit
or
stand
in
uncomfortable
positions
while
you
are
painting
them
no
picture
is
any
good
that
is
done
without
models
if
you
wanted
to
paint
a
horse
you
would
have
to
hire
a
horse
and
that
is
even
more
expensive
than
hiring
a
man
otherwise
your
horse
would
be
all
wrong
why
a
friend
of
mine
painted
a
picture
of
a
forge
and
he
had
to
have
it
all
built
up
in
his
studio
and
it
cost
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
studio
the
word
reminds
me
that
an
artist
must
have
a
special
room
to
work
in
with
windows
on
top
and
these
rooms
are
very
expensive
london
is
crammed
full
of
artists
who
have
had
all
these
advantages
and
yet
they
are
starving
the
pictures
that
you
do
now
everybody
would
laugh
at
and
where
would
you
get
the
money
for
frames
a
nice
gold
frame
might
redeem
your
pictures
but
gold
frames
are
dear
no
my
dear
matthew
you
must
not
be
a
little
fool
how
could
you
a
poor
orphan
think
of
coming
to
london
why
you
would
die
in
the
streets
no
remain
where
you
are
and
thank
god
that
you
are
earning
your
clothes
and
your
keep
with
an
honest
sawyer
in
a
land
of
peace
and
plenty
and
are
not
a
burden
on
your
poor
mother
i
hope
you
will
listen
to
your
uncle
like
a
good
boy
and
grow
up
to
be
grateful
to
him
for
saving
you
from
starvation
believe
me
your
affectionate
uncle
matthew
strang
tears
blistered
the
final
sheet
of
this
discouraging
document
his
roseate
visions
of
the
future
faded
to
cold
gray
his
heart
ached
with
a
sudden
sense
of
the
emptiness
of
existence
but
when
he
had
come
to
the
last
word
his
hand
clinched
the
letter
fiercely
a
great
glow
of
resolution
pervaded
his
being
like
the
heat
that
returns
after
a
cold
douche
will
be
a
painter
i
will
i
will
i
will
he
hissed
and
he
tore
up
the
embryo
of
the
dime
novel
and
wrote
again
to
his
uncle
my
dear
uncle
how
good
you
are
to
write
to
me
and
tell
me
everything
i
want
to
know
be
afraid
that
i
will
starve
in
london
dear
uncle
i
could
always
earn
my
living
there
in
the
fields
and
paint
late
at
night
but
i
come
till
i
have
enough
money
for
lessons
and
models
and
a
studio
though
i
think
i
could
draw
horses
without
hiring
them
i
have
always
been
very
good
at
animals
besides
what
do
they
do
when
they
want
bears
as
the
geography
book
says
there
any
bears
in
england
i
could
live
in
the
attic
and
knock
a
hole
in
the
roof
my
mother
need
anything
from
me
thank
god
as
she
is
married
again
and
bears
the
blow
well
and
my
sister
harriet
is
married
too
so
you
see
it
will
be
easy
for
me
to
save
up
money
as
soon
as
my
apprenticeship
is
over
i
shall
go
on
to
the
states
where
the
greatest
fools
make
heaps
of
money
and
so
in
a
few
years
please
god
i
shall
be
able
to
come
over
like
you
did
and
be
a
great
artist
like
you
dear
uncle
god
bless
you
from
your
loving
nephew
matthew
strang
when
i
come
over
i
will
change
my
name
if
you
like
so
as
not
to
clash
with
yours
i
know
you
would
not
like
it
if
people
thought
you
had
done
my
pictures
besides
my
real
name
now
might
be
matthew
hailey
as
mother
has
changed
hers
to
that
this
letter
evoked
no
answer
when
apprenticeship
was
at
an
end
the
first
item
of
his
programme
broke
down
for
he
lacked
the
money
to
carry
him
to
the
states
so
he
had
to
stay
on
at
farm
at
a
petty
wage
though
a
larger
than
cattermole
was
aware
of
till
he
had
scraped
a
little
together
and
then
an
accident
occurred
that
bade
fair
to
dispose
of
all
the
other
items
he
was
at
work
in
the
when
his
leg
got
jammed
between
the
log
he
was
operating
upon
and
the
carriage
that
was
bearing
it
towards
the
gang
of
saws
there
would
not
be
room
for
his
body
to
pass
between
the
gang
of
saws
and
the
framework
that
held
them
it
was
an
awful
instant
he
cried
out
but
his
voice
was
lost
in
the
roar
of
the
water
and
the
clatter
of
the
machinery
round
went
the
the
carriage
glided
along
offering
inch
after
inch
of
the
log
to
the
cruel
teeth
and
matt
was
drawn
steadily
with
it
towards
the
fatal
point
with
an
inspiration
he
drew
out
the
stout
string
he
always
carried
in
his
pocket
and
making
a
noose
threw
it
towards
a
lever
it
caught
and
matt
was
saved
for
he
had
only
to
pull
this
lever
to
close
the
gate
in
the
flume
and
shut
out
the
water
when
the
machinery
stopped
the
racket
ceased
too
and
voice
could
be
heard
and
cattermole
rushed
in
from
the
adjoining
furniture
manufactory
and
knocking
away
the
dogs
at
the
end
of
the
log
lifted
it
and
released
the
prisoner
and
then
made
him
kneel
down
and
offer
a
prayer
for
his
salvation
awakening
sense
of
logic
dimly
insinuated
that
this
was
thanking
providence
for
having
failed
to
mutilate
him
but
the
atmosphere
of
puritan
acceptance
in
which
he
moved
and
had
his
being
asphyxiated
the
nascent
scepticism
shortly
after
matt
bade
farewell
to
cattermole
farm
with
its
complex
appurtenances
a
proceeding
which
cattermole
christened
she
declared
that
he
ought
to
strip
off
the
clothes
she
had
made
him
and
depart
naked
as
he
had
come
from
a
dim
corner
of
the
kitchen
face
signalled
mind
her
god
bless
softened
by
the
accident
matt
tramped
to
cobequid
to
see
his
mother
before
departing
for
boston
and
thence
ultimately
for
england
he
felt
guilty
a
sort
of
prodigal
son
and
kept
assuring
himself
of
his
innocence
and
economy
the
third
hailey
received
him
with
a
rapture
that
almost
surpassed
she
hugged
him
to
her
bosom
with
sobs
and
told
him
her
grievances
these
were
manifold
but
seemed
analyzable
into
four
categories
one
the
remissness
of
harriet
whose
visits
were
rare
and
whose
baby
had
two
the
naughtiness
of
the
children
of
whom
matt
had
always
been
the
only
satisfactory
specimen
three
the
cruelty
of
their
in
chastising
them
for
the
same
four
the
breach
of
contract
in
refusing
to
migrate
to
halifax
or
to
permit
her
to
hold
baptist
her
black
eyes
flashed
with
strange
fire
when
she
spoke
of
her
new
crimes
and
derelictions
and
there
was
the
old
dreaded
hysteria
in
her
threats
to
throw
up
the
position
evidently
remarriage
had
not
made
her
happy
he
thought
with
added
tenderness
perhaps
nothing
could
he
shuddered
at
his
own
deeper
perception
of
unhappiness
implanted
in
temperament
and
finding
nutriment
in
any
conditions
in
conclusion
she
besought
her
boy
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
loved
her
the
only
person
to
whom
she
could
tell
her
troubles
to
go
to
halifax
instead
of
the
states
it
was
far
nearer
and
money
could
be
made
just
as
easily
her
folks
lived
at
halifax
and
though
he
must
not
dream
of
seeking
their
assistance
for
they
had
been
very
bad
to
her
mewing
her
up
strictly
so
that
she
had
been
forced
to
elope
with
her
poor
davie
still
it
would
be
a
consolation
to
know
that
he
was
near
her
own
people
likewise
not
far
from
herself
in
case
of
anything
happening
to
either
of
them
perhaps
she
would
persuade
her
husband
to
move
there
after
all
who
knew
or
she
might
come
there
herself
and
stay
with
him
for
a
week
or
two
at
any
rate
and
meantime
he
should
write
to
her
about
the
dear
old
town
moved
by
her
lack
of
reproaches
and
by
her
misery
and
impressed
into
his
olden
subjugation
to
the
handsome
masterful
woman
matt
acquiesced
perhaps
his
main
motives
were
the
comparative
cheapness
of
the
journey
and
the
reinflammation
of
his
childish
curiosity
concerning
the
gay
city
it
was
saturday
but
matt
suffered
such
tortures
under
the
moral
but
mumbled
exordiums
of
hey
of
which
his
unaccustomed
ear
took
in
less
than
ever
that
he
determined
to
depart
on
the
monday
the
deacon
seemed
to
have
aged
considerably
his
beard
was
matted
and
thick
and
his
dicky
was
stained
with
for
the
rest
matt
discovered
that
most
of
the
children
were
employed
about
the
farm
or
the
works
and
that
they
had
ceased
to
go
to
school
the
deacon
having
converted
ruth
into
a
when
she
could
be
spared
from
keeping
the
books
of
his
tannery
and
ruth
herself
he
met
with
indifference
that
the
stateliness
of
her
unexpectedly
tall
presence
did
nothing
to
thaw
he
was
surprised
to
hear
from
billy
whose
bed
he
shared
that
night
and
who
was
more
greedy
to
hear
adventures
than
to
talk
that
they
were
all
very
fond
of
her
and
that
she
could
still
romp
heartily
but
ruth
had
gradually
grown
shadowy
to
his
imagination
beside
his
burning
dreams
of
art
and
the
sight
of
her
seemed
to
add
the
last
touch
of
insubstantiality
to
her
image
and
yet
in
the
boredom
of
the
sunday
services
with
his
eye
roving
restlessly
about
the
severe
unlovely
in
search
of
distractions
he
could
not
but
be
conscious
that
she
was
the
sweetest
and
sedatest
figure
in
the
village
choir
that
sang
and
flirted
in
the
rising
tiers
of
the
gallery
over
the
vestibule
and
when
deacon
hailey
tapping
his
on
the
rails
imitated
its
note
with
a
rasping
croak
matt
had
a
flash
of
sympathy
with
the
divined
inner
life
of
the
girl
in
this
discordant
environment
he
told
her
briefly
of
his
plans
to
save
up
enough
money
to
get
to
his
uncle
in
london
who
would
doubtless
put
him
in
the
way
of
studying
art
seriously
she
said
she
wished
she
had
something
as
fine
to
live
and
work
for
still
she
was
busy
enough
what
with
and
teaching
school
as
she
put
it
smilingly
their
parting
like
their
meeting
was
awkward
and
shyness
had
come
into
their
simple
relation
neither
dared
take
the
initiative
of
a
kiss
which
for
the
rest
was
a
rare
caress
in
cobequid
save
between
children
and
lovers
relatives
shook
hands
even
women
were
not
free
of
one
lips
and
for
the
part
timidity
was
all
he
felt
in
the
presence
of
this
sweet
graceful
stranger
only
at
the
last
moment
when
she
handed
him
a
keepsake
in
the
shape
of
a
prize
copy
of
the
her
had
given
her
did
their
looks
meet
as
of
yore
and
then
it
was
more
the
young
painter
than
the
old
playmate
who
was
touched
by
the
earnest
radiance
of
her
eyes
and
the
flicker
of
rose
across
the
delicate
fairness
of
her
cheek
he
made
a
little
sketch
of
her
in
return
and
sent
it
her
from
halifax
when
he
was
on
his
way
he
opened
the
volume
and
read
on
the
to
matt
from
ruth
god
make
you
a
great
artist
chapter
viii
a
halifax
exceeded
expectations
and
gave
him
a
higher
opinion
of
his
mother
for
the
first
time
his
soul
received
the
shock
of
a
great
town
or
what
was
a
great
town
to
him
the
picturesque
bustle
enchanted
him
the
harbor
with
its
immense
basin
and
fiords
swarming
with
ships
and
boats
was
an
inexhaustible
pageant
and
sometimes
across
the
green
water
came
softened
music
from
a
giant
high
in
the
background
of
the
steep
city
that
sat
throned
between
its
waters
rose
forests
of
spruce
and
fir
from
the
citadel
on
the
hill
black
cannon
saluted
the
sunrise
and
sambro
head
and
sherbrooke
tower
shot
rays
of
warning
across
the
night
the
streets
throbbed
with
traffic
and
were
vivid
with
the
blues
and
reds
of
artillery
and
infantry
and
the
nigger
and
the
sailor
contributed
exotic
romance
on
the
wharves
of
water
street
which
were
lined
with
old
shanties
and
the
black
men
sawed
huge
piles
of
which
mounted
skyward
surrounded
by
boxes
of
smoked
herrings
on
one
of
the
wharves
endless
quintals
of
codfish
lay
in
the
sun
and
when
the
great
tide
receding
exposed
the
tall
wooden
posts
like
the
long
legs
of
some
marine
monster
covered
with
black
and
white
barnacles
and
slime
of
a
beautiful
arsenic
green
the
embryonic
artist
found
fresh
enchantment
in
this
briny
fishy
muddy
then
too
the
government
house
was
the
biggest
and
most
wonderful
building
matt
had
ever
seen
and
the
fish
fruit
and
meat
markets
were
a
confusion
of
pleasant
noises
in
the
newly
opened
park
on
the
the
wives
of
the
english
officials
and
officers
grand
dames
who
set
the
tone
of
the
city
strolled
and
rode
in
beautiful
costumes
matt
thought
that
the
detached
villas
in
which
they
lived
with
imposing
knockers
and
circumscribing
hedges
instead
of
fences
were
the
characteristic
features
of
great
american
cities
he
loved
to
watch
the
young
ladies
riding
into
the
on
their
horses
beautiful
princesses
whose
exquisite
figures
revealed
by
their
fascinated
rather
than
shocked
his
eye
accustomed
though
it
was
to
the
puritan
modesty
of
dresses
the
bulky
wrappings
of
a
village
where
to
go
out
your
was
to
betray
impure
instincts
he
would
peer
into
the
enclosure
with
a
strange
wistful
longing
eager
to
catch
stray
music
of
their
speech
silver
ripples
of
their
laughter
he
wondered
if
he
would
ever
talk
to
such
celestial
creatures
for
whom
life
went
so
smooth
and
so
fair
what
charming
pictures
they
made
in
the
lovely
summer
days
when
the
officers
played
against
the
club
and
they
sat
on
the
sward
drinking
tea
under
the
shady
trees
in
white
dresses
with
white
lace
parasols
held
over
their
softly
glinting
hair
to
shield
the
shining
purity
of
their
complexions
a
refreshing
contrast
of
cool
color
with
the
scarlet
of
the
uniforms
sometimes
the
wistful
eyes
of
the
boy
grew
dim
with
sad
delicious
tears
how
inaccessible
was
all
this
beautiful
life
whose
gracious
harmonies
whose
sweet
refinements
some
subtle
instinct
divined
and
responded
to
at
moments
he
felt
he
could
almost
barter
his
dreams
of
art
to
move
in
these
heavenly
spheres
among
these
dainty
creatures
whose
every
gesture
was
grace
whose
every
tone
was
ravishment
there
was
one
girl
the
most
bewitching
of
all
whom
he
only
saw
in
the
saddle
so
that
in
his
image
of
her
as
in
his
sketches
of
her
she
was
always
on
a
beautiful
chestnut
horse
which
she
sat
with
matchless
ease
and
decision
a
tall
slender
girl
with
hair
that
lay
soft
and
fluffy
about
the
forehead
of
her
lovely
english
face
her
favorite
canter
was
along
the
and
here
before
he
had
found
work
he
would
loiter
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
how
he
longed
yet
dreaded
that
she
might
some
day
perceive
his
presence
sometimes
so
high
flew
his
secret
audacious
dream
that
in
imagination
he
patted
her
glossy
neck
in
such
an
exhilarating
atmosphere
the
boy
felt
great
impulses
surge
within
him
but
alas
the
seamy
side
of
great
cities
was
borne
in
on
him
also
he
had
a
vile
lodging
in
the
central
slums
near
the
roof
of
a
tall
that
tottered
between
two
groggeries
and
here
drunken
wharfingers
and
sailors
and
negro
wenches
and
irishmen
reeled
and
swore
to
a
lad
brought
up
in
godly
cobequid
where
drunkenness
was
spoken
of
with
bated
breath
this
unquestionable
supremacy
of
satan
was
both
shocking
and
unsettling
nevertheless
matt
spent
the
first
days
in
a
trance
of
delight
for
apart
from
and
above
all
other
wonders
there
were
in
the
town
and
the
works
of
the
local
celebrity
were
marked
at
twenty
or
thirty
and
even
fifty
dollars
apiece
they
were
of
considerable
merit
that
excited
admiration
without
quite
overwhelming
him
on
the
strength
of
colossal
prices
matt
invested
some
of
his
scanty
stock
of
dollars
in
a
kit
of
paint
at
a
fairy
shop
where
shone
collapsible
tubes
of
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before
and
delightful
brushes
and
easels
and
canvases
he
also
bought
two
books
one
entitled
and
the
other
house
which
combined
to
oppress
him
with
his
ignorance
of
the
human
form
divine
and
the
house
beautiful
and
became
his
serving
to
raise
his
pillow
his
conceit
fell
to
zero
when
he
saw
a
portrait
by
sir
joshua
reynolds
among
the
collection
in
the
session
hall
after
a
depressing
delay
mitigated
only
by
the
sight
of
his
fair
horsewoman
he
found
work
in
a
furniture
shop
at
the
top
of
an
old
rambling
warehouse
that
was
congested
with
broken
litter
and
old
pianos
the
proprietor
not
only
dealt
in
débris
but
bought
new
furniture
and
had
it
painted
in
the
loft
matt
received
six
dollars
a
week
half
of
which
he
saved
for
his
english
campaign
at
first
he
had
the
atelier
to
himself
but
as
the
business
increased
he
was
given
a
subordinate
a
frenchman
rather
shorter
than
himself
who
swore
incomprehensibly
and
was
restive
under
surveyorship
by
this
time
matt
had
learned
something
of
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
so
he
treated
his
man
to
liquor
after
the
frenchman
had
got
drunk
several
times
at
the
expense
of
his
sober
superior
he
discovered
that
matt
was
his
brother
and
peace
reigned
in
the
but
matt
did
not
remain
long
in
halifax
the
jabber
of
the
mushroom
millionaires
of
the
states
though
he
failed
to
explain
his
own
distance
from
these
golden
regions
fired
imagination
and
he
resolved
to
go
to
boston
in
accordance
with
his
original
programme
he
considered
he
had
sufficiently
studied
his
wishes
and
her
letters
had
become
too
incoherent
for
attention
it
was
a
pain
not
a
pleasure
to
receive
them
he
was
not
surprised
to
learn
from
letters
that
domestic
broils
were
frequent
and
that
the
proverbial
wisdom
did
not
avail
to
cope
with
threats
of
suicide
it
was
only
poor
girlish
sweetness
that
could
bring
calm
into
these
household
cyclones
and
so
one
fine
evening
matt
set
sail
for
the
city
of
culture
and
everything
seemed
of
good
augury
though
the
expense
of
the
trip
had
wellnigh
eaten
up
his
savings
his
heart
was
as
light
as
his
pocket
he
was
going
only
to
the
states
but
he
felt
that
in
quitting
his
native
soil
the
voyage
to
london
the
temple
of
art
and
to
his
uncle
its
had
begun
the
moon
shone
over
the
twinkling
harbor
like
a
great
gold
coin
and
as
the
vessel
spread
its
canvas
wings
and
glided
out
of
the
confusion
of
shipping
matt
felt
that
its
name
was
not
the
least
happy
omen
in
this
auspicious
moment
the
ship
was
named
that
night
finding
some
confusion
about
the
distribution
of
bunks
matt
lay
down
on
deck
with
and
house
for
his
pillows
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
weary
tempered
by
a
farrago
of
inconsequent
dreams
when
he
woke
up
next
morning
he
rubbed
his
eyes
from
more
than
sleepiness
halifax
seemed
still
to
confront
his
vision
its
hills
its
forts
its
wharves
george
island
the
point
and
the
great
harbor
in
which
rocked
gently
what
was
this
hallucination
he
soon
discovered
that
it
was
reality
there
had
been
a
in
the
night
and
the
ship
had
dropped
her
anchor
in
the
harbor
for
safety
the
incident
was
typical
in
the
course
of
the
voyage
matt
learned
to
know
the
captain
a
grizzled
old
with
the
heart
of
a
bitch
the
ship
was
his
own
and
he
sailed
it
himself
to
save
expense
and
check
dishonesty
there
is
a
proverb
about
saving
a
pennyworth
of
tar
and
captain
bludgeon
illustrated
it
no
man
was
ever
so
unfitted
to
walk
the
his
idea
of
navigation
was
to
hug
the
coast
and
he
seized
every
pretext
for
putting
in
at
creeks
or
ports
and
anchoring
for
the
night
when
the
crew
would
go
ashore
and
come
back
incapable
the
schooner
itself
was
an
old
tub
a
cumbrous
craft
but
sound
in
timber
matt
had
a
rough
time
though
the
reading
of
the
made
the
voyage
enchanted
the
passengers
were
a
plebeian
crowd
a
score
of
women
mostly
and
single
fifteen
men
emigrating
to
the
states
and
a
few
children
there
were
only
six
bunks
the
mate
had
given
up
his
which
matt
was
to
have
shared
to
some
of
the
women
those
who
could
not
secure
bunks
herded
dressed
in
a
big
field
bed
which
also
accommodated
some
of
the
men
likewise
sleeping
in
their
clothes
for
toilet
operations
all
the
women
resorted
to
the
which
held
a
mirror
and
washing
apparatus
etiquette
was
the
food
was
horrible
the
menus
being
almost
ingenious
in
their
unpalatableness
fortunately
most
of
the
passengers
were
sick
already
matt
had
no
immunity
all
the
pangs
of
his
first
pipe
were
repeated
without
the
moral
qualms
which
rationalized
those
he
continued
to
sleep
on
deck
as
often
as
he
could
making
friends
with
the
stars
when
the
night
was
too
chilly
he
couched
on
the
near
the
stove
thus
was
he
spared
licentious
spectacles
and
his
innocence
was
granted
a
little
longer
term
they
passed
the
signals
and
of
sable
point
safely
captain
face
as
white
as
the
breakers
that
girdled
its
barren
rock
then
instead
of
making
a
for
boston
the
captain
fetched
a
semicircle
following
the
new
england
coast
line
and
holding
on
to
the
of
his
mother
earth
such
voyaging
he
conceived
to
be
sure
if
slow
mistakenly
enough
considering
the
character
of
the
coast
the
passengers
once
they
had
got
over
their
sickness
did
not
complain
for
they
had
the
leisure
of
poverty
and
the
prospect
of
indefinite
board
and
lodging
was
not
unpleasing
and
their
frequent
diversified
the
monotony
of
the
voyage
with
little
excursions
one
night
having
been
driven
into
harbor
by
a
capful
of
wind
they
witnessed
the
fishing
it
was
a
scene
that
set
fingers
itching
for
the
brush
waving
torches
glittering
on
the
water
from
dozens
of
boats
and
lighting
up
the
tanned
faces
of
the
fishers
who
were
scooping
up
the
herrings
with
nets
every
detail
gave
him
the
keenest
joy
the
wavering
refractions
in
the
water
the
leaping
silver
of
the
fish
touched
with
gold
flame
the
sombre
mystery
of
sea
and
sky
above
and
around
the
night
was
made
even
more
memorable
for
some
of
the
girls
who
had
landed
brought
back
in
giggling
triumph
many
bundles
of
cured
herrings
which
they
had
pilfered
from
an
unguarded
and
these
they
generously
distributed
so
that
the
whole
ship
supped
deliciously
in
defiance
of
the
cook
on
another
occasion
in
the
afternoon
at
matt
and
about
a
score
of
the
passengers
the
majority
females
went
on
shore
to
pick
as
they
called
the
gray
cranberries
that
grew
in
the
swamps
and
they
tarried
so
long
that
when
they
came
back
to
the
boat
they
found
the
tide
turned
and
two
hundred
yards
of
mud
between
them
and
the
water
one
of
the
men
tried
the
mud
and
sank
to
the
knees
in
slimy
batter
in
the
end
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
launch
the
empty
boat
and
then
wade
to
it
the
launching
was
easy
the
boat
slipping
along
as
on
grease
but
the
sequel
was
boisterous
jack
floss
a
strapping
with
a
blond
mustache
and
a
humor
set
the
example
of
giving
a
woman
a
to
save
her
skirts
and
the
few
other
men
followed
suit
returning
again
and
again
for
fresh
freight
the
air
resounded
with
hysterical
giggling
and
screaming
as
the
women
frantically
clutched
their
bearers
some
of
whom
extorted
unreluctant
kisses
under
jocose
threats
of
tumbling
their
burdens
over
into
the
mud
one
or
two
actually
carried
out
their
threats
by
involuntarily
stepping
suddenly
into
a
gutter
worn
by
the
rains
and
sinking
up
to
the
waist
but
the
mishaps
abated
no
jot
of
the
madcap
merriment
it
rather
augmented
the
rowdiness
as
the
women
were
hauled
from
their
for
his
part
matt
waded
warily
more
conscious
of
the
responsibility
than
of
the
fun
for
he
was
doing
his
duty
manfully
as
became
a
lad
stout
sturdy
and
sixteen
his
second
burden
was
a
slim
pretty
named
priscilla
and
when
he
was
depositing
her
speckless
in
the
boat
she
took
the
opportunity
of
the
embrace
to
kiss
him
in
hearty
gratitude
matt
dropped
her
like
a
hot
coal
he
felt
scorched
and
flustered
and
had
a
bewildered
moment
of
burning
blushes
ere
he
ploughed
his
way
back
to
rescue
another
of
the
distressed
damsels
that
sudden
kiss
was
an
epoch
in
his
growth
a
discomfort
at
the
time
the
of
it
lent
new
warmth
to
his
interest
in
the
royal
amours
of
the
in
his
dreams
he
bore
delectable
eastern
princesses
across
perilous
magic
marshes
and
their
gratitude
found
him
stockish
no
longer
the
next
episode
in
this
curious
creeping
voyage
was
superficially
more
critical
for
matt
a
sudden
gale
upset
all
poor
captain
calculations
he
was
near
shore
as
usual
and
tried
to
beat
into
harbor
almost
under
bare
poles
but
the
haven
was
of
a
dangerous
entrance
narrow
and
choked
in
the
throat
by
a
rock
and
no
one
on
board
had
sufficient
seamanship
to
get
the
schooner
in
the
mate
advised
abandoning
the
hope
of
harbor
and
setting
the
jib
and
the
to
make
leeway
the
captain
swore
by
everything
unholy
he
would
not
go
a
cable
farther
out
to
sea
the
night
was
closing
in
but
the
wind
dying
away
anchored
outside
the
harbor
but
in
the
night
the
wind
sprang
up
from
the
opposite
quarter
fiercer
than
ever
and
the
vessel
dragged
her
anchors
and
drove
towards
the
rock
that
squatted
on
guard
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
pitching
helplessly
in
the
shifting
troughs
in
the
inky
blackness
great
swamping
waves
carried
off
her
boats
her
and
both
houses
her
anchors
were
left
behind
her
and
part
of
the
bulwarks
was
likewise
torn
away
fortunately
her
cables
held
out
as
she
drove
bumping
along
though
they
did
not
moderate
her
pace
sufficiently
to
prevent
her
keel
being
partially
torn
away
when
she
bumped
upon
a
reef
yet
she
jolted
over
the
reef
and
drifted
blindly
on
and
on
none
knew
whither
within
the
schooner
the
scene
was
almost
as
wild
as
without
the
screams
rivalled
those
of
the
wind
the
distracted
creatures
ran
up
and
down
the
getting
in
the
way
of
the
crew
the
captain
went
below
to
quiet
them
and
did
not
return
apparently
he
preferred
the
society
of
his
own
sex
the
mate
thus
left
in
command
boarded
up
the
to
stop
the
aimless
scurrying
and
told
off
some
of
the
crew
to
help
him
unload
the
cargo
which
consisted
of
plaster
and
to
pitch
it
overboard
matt
and
the
cook
bore
a
hand
in
the
work
not
daring
to
unhatch
for
fear
of
being
they
had
to
pass
the
plaster
through
the
lazaret
jack
floss
did
his
best
to
comfort
the
females
by
profanities
he
laughed
and
hoped
the
lord
would
damn
the
old
hulk
whose
fleas
were
big
enough
to
swim
ashore
on
his
cool
blasphemies
calmed
some
but
others
plainly
regarded
him
as
a
jonah
matt
was
half
perturbed
half
fascinated
by
this
unconventional
vagabond
of
the
real
danger
his
own
buoyancy
made
light
when
the
morning
light
came
at
last
it
showed
that
they
had
providentially
skirted
the
grim
rock
and
were
drifting
into
harbor
the
deck
was
covered
with
débris
and
with
sand
which
the
ship
had
stirred
and
raked
up
in
her
dragging
progress
along
the
shallow
waters
piles
of
grit
had
accumulated
in
the
corners
and
the
waves
on
which
she
tossed
were
discolored
with
dirt
very
soon
she
passed
a
little
island
where
a
brig
lay
moored
and
with
great
difficulty
for
the
sea
was
still
running
high
the
brig
sent
her
a
hawser
and
made
her
fast
then
they
were
enabled
to
realize
further
the
extent
of
their
luck
for
the
harbor
was
strewn
with
wreckage
no
fewer
than
seven
schooners
had
gone
down
and
only
two
men
had
been
saved
the
harbor
was
alive
with
boats
looking
for
the
dead
captain
bludgeon
bestriding
his
desolate
congratulated
himself
on
his
seamanship
he
arranged
with
a
tug
to
draw
back
to
john
new
brunswick
for
repairs
the
few
impatient
passengers
who
could
afford
to
pay
an
extra
fee
went
on
to
boston
by
the
rescuing
brig
but
the
majority
stuck
to
and
captain
bludgeon
who
was
compelled
to
board
and
lodge
them
at
a
cheap
hotel
while
the
schooner
was
laid
up
thus
were
the
fates
kind
to
these
waifs
on
the
ocean
of
life
who
enjoyed
the
holiday
after
their
manner
plain
living
and
high
jinks
and
had
no
need
of
satan
or
even
jack
floss
to
find
mischief
for
their
idle
hands
to
do
matt
however
was
not
of
the
roysterers
he
had
remained
with
of
course
not
having
the
money
to
exchange
but
the
scenery
of
a
new
town
and
that
a
town
like
john
with
a
cathedral
a
silver
water
and
a
forest
afire
with
flowers
was
always
sufficient
business
for
him
the
cathedral
was
not
so
colossal
as
it
had
loomed
to
his
childish
fancy
through
reminiscences
after
a
day
or
two
matt
found
an
even
more
delightful
occupation
he
happened
to
remark
to
jack
floss
that
the
ceiling
of
the
hotel
would
be
all
the
better
for
a
little
ornamentation
and
that
worthy
straightway
sought
out
the
proprietor
a
gentleman
of
scotch
descent
and
expressed
himself
so
picturesquely
that
matt
was
offered
a
dollar
to
make
the
ceiling
worthy
of
being
sat
under
by
artistic
souls
like
jack
floss
thereupon
jack
floss
and
everybody
else
except
matt
were
turned
out
of
the
and
the
boy
guided
by
his
house
in
the
mixing
of
colors
and
the
preparation
of
plaster
stood
on
the
ladder
and
stencilled
one
of
his
imaginative
medleys
his
were
not
permitted
to
see
it
till
it
was
ready
but
speculation
was
rife
and
the
rumor
of
its
glories
had
spread
about
the
and
on
the
room
was
packed
with
motley
spectators
gazing
reverently
heavenward
as
at
fireworks
some
breaking
out
into
rapturous
exclamations
that
made
the
boy
more
hot
and
uncomfortable
than
even
the
kiss
had
done
he
was
glad
he
was
almost
invisible
squeezed
into
a
corner
by
the
crowd
and
despite
his
discomfort
aggravated
by
a
crick
in
the
back
of
the
neck
due
to
painting
with
his
hand
over
his
head
there
was
a
subtle
pleasure
for
him
in
his
facile
recognition
of
the
fishing
scene
which
formed
the
centre
of
the
decorations
the
hotel
bar
did
good
business
that
day
just
before
started
again
for
boston
a
man
came
to
see
the
ceiling
and
immediately
offered
the
artist
a
commission
there
was
a
in
the
works
and
matt
could
have
a
situation
just
vacant
there
at
ten
dollars
a
week
dazzled
by
these
fabulous
terms
which
seemed
almost
to
realize
his
ambition
at
a
bound
matt
accepted
and
patched
up
and
refitted
sailed
without
him
a
few
hours
later
he
discovered
that
it
had
also
sailed
without
priscilla
that
seductive
young
person
having
found
a
berth
as
chambermaid
in
the
hotel
she
came
into
room
to
tidy
up
and
expressed
her
joy
at
the
prospect
of
looking
after
his
comfort
but
the
boy
told
her
he
must
seek
less
comfortable
quarters
and
despite
her
protests
and
her
offers
to
help
him
temporarily
he
departed
for
cheaper
lodgings
leaving
behind
him
a
perfunctory
promise
to
call
and
see
her
soon
jack
floss
whom
matt
gratefully
regarded
as
the
architect
of
his
fortunes
had
half
a
mind
to
stay
behind
too
he
said
he
wanted
to
go
under
and
seem
to
have
any
luck
but
at
the
last
moment
he
found
that
he
could
not
desert
the
ladies
matt
was
more
sorry
to
part
from
him
than
from
priscilla
there
was
something
in
the
young
manner
that
appealed
to
the
germs
of
bohemianism
in
the
artistic
temperament
the
young
artist
had
however
an
unpleasant
reminder
of
the
defects
of
the
bohemian
temperament
for
jack
floss
was
forced
to
confess
that
he
had
lost
the
copy
of
the
which
he
had
persuaded
matt
to
lend
him
to
beguile
the
tedium
of
the
days
of
waiting
the
boy
was
grievously
distressed
by
the
loss
it
seemed
an
insult
to
ruth
hailey
and
a
misprision
of
her
kindly
wishes
however
it
was
no
use
crying
over
spilled
milk
and
jack
floss
slightly
assuaged
his
chagrin
by
fishing
out
from
among
his
miscellaneous
effects
a
volume
of
shelley
in
small
type
and
another
with
an
even
more
microscopic
text
containing
the
complete
works
of
lord
byron
both
books
opened
as
by
long
usage
at
their
most
erotic
pages
through
these
ivory
gates
the
boy
passed
into
the
great
world
of
romantic
poetry
whole
stanzas
remained
in
his
memory
the
brain
that
had
refused
to
retain
bible
verses
spending
hours
in
quest
of
the
tiniest
absorbed
the
sensuous
images
of
the
poets
without
effort
he
fell
asleep
with
them
on
his
lips
in
the
shop
a
spacious
saloon
as
full
of
painters
as
an
atelier
in
the
quartier
latin
matt
was
allowed
a
free
hand
on
great
canvases
that
when
filled
with
flowers
and
landscapes
were
nailed
to
the
roofs
of
the
carriages
by
electroplated
pins
he
also
decorated
the
wooden
panels
with
and
foliage
and
gilded
the
lettering
outside
the
doors
thus
was
the
citizen
fed
on
art
at
every
turn
standing
under
his
ceiling
or
sitting
on
his
chair
or
lying
on
his
sofa
or
travelling
on
his
railway
art
is
notoriously
elevating
but
as
the
depraved
quarters
of
the
town
continued
to
flourish
the
art
must
have
been
bad
career
in
the
was
neither
so
long
nor
so
pleasant
as
he
had
anticipated
his
pictures
did
not
please
his
as
much
as
his
employers
and
he
became
the
butt
of
the
place
a
series
of
impalpable
irritations
almost
too
slight
for
analysis
subtle
with
that
devilish
refinement
of
which
coarseness
is
only
capable
when
it
is
cruel
rendered
his
life
intolerable
vocabulary
was
too
mincing
for
his
they
resented
his
absence
of
expletives
though
imperceptibly
he
succumbed
to
the
polluted
atmosphere
which
had
surrounded
him
ever
since
he
set
foot
in
halifax
and
the
boy
whose
mind
was
stored
with
lovely
images
and
ethereal
lyrics
began
to
bespatter
his
talk
with
meaningless
oaths
nor
was
this
his
only
coquetry
with
corruption
for
the
daily
taunt
of
conspired
with
the
ferment
of
youth
was
his
day
of
danger
it
was
and
matt
had
boundless
money
it
was
also
the
hardest
day
of
the
six
the
when
all
the
work
of
the
week
was
varnished
in
an
atmosphere
of
sixty
degrees
and
the
poor
lad
drunk
with
the
fumes
of
turpentine
sticky
from
head
to
foot
his
face
besplashed
his
eyes
stinging
his
nose
red
and
his
brain
dizzy
threw
off
his
apron
and
overalls
and
reeled
to
the
door
and
groped
his
way
into
the
streets
to
breathe
in
the
glorious
fresh
air
and
revel
like
the
rest
of
his
fellows
in
the
joy
of
life
aye
and
the
joy
of
license
the
saturnalia
of
saturday
night
for
the
glorious
fresh
air
soon
palled
and
in
the
evening
matt
was
dragged
by
his
mates
to
a
species
of
in
a
hotel
near
the
harbor
where
in
a
festive
reek
of
bad
tobacco
and
worse
whiskey
he
repeated
the
choruses
of
winking
soubrettes
dubious
refrains
whose
inner
meaning
the
brag
and
badinage
of
the
workshop
had
made
obscurely
clear
but
disgust
invariably
supervened
byron
and
shelley
were
his
sunday
reading
and
under
the
spell
of
their
romantic
song
which
chimed
with
his
awakening
melodies
he
revolted
against
his
companions
hating
himself
for
almost
sinking
to
their
level
he
felt
that
he
inhabited
a
rarer
ether
he
was
conscious
of
a
curious
aloofness
not
only
from
them
but
from
humanity
at
large
and
yet
here
he
was
joining
in
their
coarse
conviviality
to
such
a
mood
the
accidental
turning
up
of
an
old
sketch
of
his
halifax
divinity
on
her
horse
appealed
as
decisively
as
an
accidental
text
was
wont
to
appeal
to
his
mother
the
beautiful
curves
of
her
figure
the
purity
of
her
complexion
rebuked
him
perhaps
it
was
because
he
was
an
artist
that
his
soul
was
touched
through
the
concrete
in
a
spasm
of
acuter
disgust
and
in
a
confidence
of
higher
destinies
he
threw
up
his
berth
he
had
saved
twenty
dollars
twenty
stout
planks
between
him
and
the
deep
but
the
luck
that
had
been
his
hitherto
deserted
him
in
six
weeks
he
had
only
one
fortunate
fortnight
when
he
carried
the
hod
for
a
and
was
nearly
choked
by
the
veering
round
of
a
little
ladder
through
which
he
had
popped
his
head
in
mounting
a
bigger
one
by
one
his
twenty
planks
slipped
from
under
him
and
then
he
found
himself
struggling
in
the
lowest
depths
the
few
dollars
he
had
squandered
on
the
haunted
him
with
added
reproach
too
proud
to
beg
or
to
go
back
to
the
or
to
write
to
his
mother
his
only
possessions
his
clothes
and
a
box
of
cheap
he
carried
with
his
slim
library
in
his
jacket
pockets
he
searched
the
streets
for
an
odd
job
or
stood
about
the
wharves
amid
the
stevedores
and
negroes
to
earn
a
copper
by
unasked
assistance
in
rolling
casks
into
warehouses
till
at
last
when
the
cathedral
lawn
was
carpeted
with
autumn
leaves
the
streets
became
his
only
lodging
hungry
and
homeless
he
was
beginning
to
regret
his
hut
in
the
woods
and
to
meditate
a
retreat
from
civilization
for
in
the
frosty
nights
that
shadowed
the
genial
autumn
days
this
unsheltered
life
was
not
pleasant
when
by
one
of
those
strokes
of
fortune
which
fall
to
the
most
unfortunate
he
found
a
a
of
his
at
the
hotel
of
the
beautiful
star
a
out
of
work
with
whom
he
had
once
halved
his
evening
bread
fell
into
employment
and
gratefully
offered
him
the
nocturnal
hospitality
of
the
factory
here
voluptuously
couched
on
warm
white
sand
piles
and
barrels
of
which
lay
all
about
the
boy
forgot
the
gnawing
emptiness
of
his
stomach
and
the
forlornness
of
his
situation
in
the
endless
fascination
of
the
weird
effects
of
light
and
shade
it
was
a
vast
place
dim
despite
its
mysterious
with
shadowy
black
corners
the
red
flannel
shirts
of
the
men
struck
a
flamboyant
note
of
color
in
the
duskiness
the
stokers
were
outlined
in
red
before
the
roaring
furnaces
the
blowers
were
bathed
in
a
dazzling
white
glow
from
the
glass
at
the
end
of
their
so
that
their
brawny
bare
arms
and
the
sweat
on
their
brows
stood
out
luridly
with
every
movement
with
every
flickering
and
waning
light
there
was
a
changing
play
of
color
matt
would
lie
awake
in
his
corner
taking
mental
notes
or
recording
the
action
of
muscles
by
the
pencilled
silhouette
of
some
picturesque
figure
rolling
the
pliant
glass
great
painters
he
thought
in
his
boyish
ignorance
worked
from
imagination
on
a
basis
of
memory
but
he
was
not
strong
enough
yet
to
dispense
with
observation
though
observation
always
brought
despair
of
his
power
to
catch
the
subtleties
of
living
nature
in
the
enthralment
of
these
studies
and
in
his
sensuous
delight
in
the
dantesque
effects
matt
often
omitted
to
sleep
altogether
and
sometimes
on
that
background
of
ruddy
gloom
other
visions
opened
out
to
the
boy
dreaming
on
his
bed
of
sinuous
sand
the
real
merged
into
the
imaginative
and
this
again
into
the
fantasies
of
delicious
drowsihead
the
walls
fell
away
the
factory
blossomed
into
exotic
realms
of
romance
peerless
houris
ripe
in
womanhood
passed
over
waters
in
gliding
caïques
prisoned
princesses
pining
for
love
showed
dark
starry
eyes
behind
the
of
verandas
pensive
maidens
divinely
beautiful
wandered
at
twilight
under
crescent
moons
rising
faint
and
ghostly
behind
groves
of
cedars
london
too
figured
in
the
pageantry
of
his
dreams
glittering
like
a
city
of
the
ablaze
with
palaces
athrob
with
music
and
perched
on
the
top
of
the
tallest
cupola
on
the
loftiest
hill
stood
his
uncle
matthew
holding
his
like
a
sceptre
king
of
the
realm
of
art
hark
was
that
not
the
trumpeters
calling
calling
him
to
the
great
city
calling
him
to
climb
up
and
take
his
place
beside
the
sovereign
oh
the
call
to
his
youth
the
clarion
call
summoning
him
forth
to
toils
and
triumphs
in
some
enchanted
land
oh
the
seething
of
the
young
blood
that
thronged
the
halls
of
dream
with
loveliness
and
set
seductive
faces
at
the
casements
of
sleep
and
sanctified
his
waking
reveries
with
prescient
glimpses
of
a
sweet
waiting
in
some
veiled
recess
of
space
and
time
to
partake
and
inspire
his
consecration
to
art
the
narrow
teachings
of
his
childhood
the
conception
of
a
vale
of
tears
and
temptation
shrivelled
away
like
clouds
melting
into
the
illimitable
blue
merging
in
a
vast
sense
of
the
miracle
of
a
beautiful
world
a
world
of
infinitely
notable
form
and
color
and
this
expansion
of
his
horizon
accomplished
itself
almost
imperceptibly
because
the
oppression
of
that
ancient
heaven
overbrooding
earth
of
that
sombre
heaven
lying
over
cobequid
village
like
a
pall
was
not
upon
him
and
he
was
free
to
move
and
breathe
in
an
independence
that
made
existence
ecstasy
even
at
its
harshest
so
that
though
he
walked
in
hunger
and
cold
he
walked
under
triumphal
arches
of
rainbows
chapter
ix
artist
and
puritan
but
the
dauntless
practical
youth
lay
beneath
the
dreamer
even
as
the
puritan
lay
beneath
the
artist
matt
could
not
consent
to
live
on
his
host
the
who
shared
his
lunch
with
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
he
was
almost
reduced
to
applying
again
at
the
when
the
captain
of
a
schooner
gave
him
a
chance
to
work
his
way
to
economy
on
the
basin
of
minas
miles
below
cobequid
village
matt
had
to
make
up
his
mind
in
a
hurry
for
this
was
the
last
ship
bound
north
before
the
bay
was
frozen
for
the
winter
and
ships
bound
south
for
the
states
seemed
always
to
have
a
plethora
of
crew
the
mental
conflict
added
to
the
pains
of
the
situation
to
go
north
again
was
to
confess
defeat
but
was
it
not
a
severer
defeat
to
lessen
a
poor
lunch
even
although
he
accepted
only
a
minimum
on
the
pretext
of
not
being
hungry
this
reflection
decided
him
though
he
had
no
prospects
in
economy
and
nothing
to
gain
but
a
few
food
and
shelter
he
agreed
informally
to
ship
and
to
help
load
the
schooner
at
nightfall
he
would
have
preferred
to
go
on
board
at
once
were
it
only
to
dine
off
a
biscuit
but
no
one
suspected
his
straits
and
so
he
had
an
afternoon
of
sauntering
on
the
hilly
outskirts
of
the
city
he
was
stopped
by
a
stylish
young
lady
so
dazzling
in
dress
and
beauty
that
for
a
moment
he
did
not
recognize
priscilla
a
fashionable
crinoline
and
a
astrakhan
sacque
together
with
an
afghan
muffler
round
her
throat
had
given
the
slim
chambermaid
an
imposing
portliness
an
astrakhan
toque
with
a
waving
red
feather
was
set
daintily
on
her
head
and
below
the
sacque
her
gown
showed
magnificent
with
bows
and
airy
flounces
evidently
her
afternoon
out
land
she
cried
have
you
been
up
to
in
a
hurry
he
said
flushing
shamefacedly
as
he
passed
hastily
on
but
priscilla
caught
him
by
the
hem
of
his
jacket
look
so
skairt
why
you
been
to
see
me
all
this
time
busy
he
murmured
proud
i
reckon
i
thought
come
for
to
look
at
your
decorations
anyways
go
right
along
there
you
as
smart
as
a
cricket
a
fact
make
you
a
glass
real
nice
grog
to
pick
you
up
he
shook
his
head
going
away
off
to
you
want
to
give
me
the
mitten
why
you
speak
straight
you
like
she
looked
at
him
half
provoked
half
provokingly
he
looked
at
her
with
his
frank
boyish
gaze
he
noted
the
red
curve
of
her
pouting
lips
the
subtle
light
in
her
eyes
the
warm
coloring
of
the
skin
shadowed
at
the
neck
by
waves
of
soft
brown
hair
in
which
the
beads
of
a
chenille
net
glistened
bluishly
he
was
pleasured
by
the
brave
note
of
the
red
feather
against
the
shining
black
of
the
toque
the
piquant
relation
of
the
toque
to
the
face
and
he
thought
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
transfer
all
these
tones
and
shades
to
canvas
he
forgot
to
answer
her
he
tried
to
store
up
the
complex
image
in
his
memory
glad
you
deny
it
she
said
her
angry
face
belying
her
words
he
started
yes
i
like
you
well
enough
he
said
awkwardly
her
face
softened
archly
why
you
come
see
me
i
bite
you
sorry
sailing
guess
you
she
smiled
imperious
solicitation
are
you
to
do
in
economy
why
you
stick
to
the
left
there
way
back
in
the
made
you
leave
well
you
got
no
money
there
was
tender
concern
in
her
tones
many
meals
have
you
had
he
had
a
flash
of
resentment
you
worry
about
me
he
said
gruffly
said
priscilla
contemptuously
though
her
voice
faltered
jest
to
come
along
and
have
a
good
square
not
not
hungry
matt
where
you
expect
to
go
to
said
priscilla
with
a
roguish
disarming
smile
with
you
rejoined
matt
smiling
in
response
priscilla
laughed
heartily
the
white
teeth
gleamed
roguishly
against
the
full
red
lips
along
she
said
with
conclusiveness
he
shook
a
smiling
head
going
to
with
me
the
stand
you
a
dinner
for
your
wrong
with
them
he
asked
anxiously
he
knew
from
his
book
how
liable
such
things
were
to
decay
the
centre
of
the
is
a
bit
off
color
that
silly
old
owl
of
a
cynthia
spilt
a
pail
of
water
on
the
floor
say
he
cried
in
concern
injun
i
was
jest
mad
you
could
get
lots
to
do
if
you
would
stay
at
our
come
and
put
the
ceiling
right
he
said
indecisively
and
giving
her
his
hand
with
shy
awkwardness
was
promenaded
in
triumph
through
the
dignified
streets
he
felt
a
thrill
of
romance
as
this
dazzling
person
clasped
his
hand
clingingly
he
wondered
how
she
dared
be
seen
with
so
shabby
a
being
the
juxtaposition
had
a
touch
of
the
of
the
amorous
adventures
of
his
it
was
like
a
princess
wooing
a
pauper
they
passed
other
couples
better
matched
some
in
the
first
stage
of
courtship
some
in
the
second
in
the
first
stage
the
female
and
the
male
walked
apart
she
near
the
wall
talking
glibly
he
at
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
silent
gazing
straight
ahead
in
apparent
disconnection
in
the
second
stage
the
lovers
walked
closer
together
but
now
both
gazed
straight
ahead
and
both
were
silent
only
if
one
looked
between
them
one
saw
two
red
hands
clasped
together
like
the
antennæ
of
two
insects
in
conversation
when
priscilla
and
matt
met
pairs
in
this
advanced
stage
her
hand
tightened
on
his
and
she
sidled
nearer
it
was
like
a
third
stage
and
sense
of
romance
was
modified
by
a
blushing
shamefacedness
as
they
entered
the
hotel
matt
made
instinctively
towards
the
to
see
his
damaged
decorations
but
priscilla
protesting
that
he
must
feed
first
steered
him
hurriedly
into
his
old
apartment
he
was
too
faint
with
hunger
to
resist
her
stronger
will
you
silly
boy
she
said
affectionately
depositing
him
in
a
chair
before
the
stove
which
she
lighted
you
jest
set
there
while
i
tell
the
she
lingered
a
moment
to
caress
his
dark
hair
then
stooping
down
suddenly
she
kissed
him
and
fled
heart
beat
violently
the
blood
hustled
in
his
ears
the
sense
of
romance
grew
stronger
but
mingled
therewith
was
now
an
uneasy
indefinable
apprehension
of
the
unknown
the
magnetism
of
priscilla
repelled
as
much
as
it
drew
him
his
romance
was
touched
with
vague
terror
yet
as
the
fire
vivified
the
bleak
bedroom
with
its
walls
the
warm
curves
of
the
face
painted
themselves
on
the
air
subtly
alluring
priscilla
herself
was
back
soon
bearing
some
cold
victual
and
some
hot
grog
and
watched
with
tender
satisfaction
the
untroubled
appetite
she
drank
a
little
too
when
he
was
done
and
they
clinked
glasses
and
matt
felt
it
was
all
very
wicked
and
charming
stanzas
of
shelley
and
byron
pulsed
in
his
memory
tropical
flowers
of
speech
blossomed
in
his
brain
but
only
weeds
sprouted
out
was
real
good
of
you
priscilla
to
speak
to
the
boss
better
see
to
the
ceiling
at
it
can
wait
till
i
promised
to
go
aboard
nasty
feller
to
shake
me
after
say
that
priscilla
he
said
shyly
only
wish
i
could
do
something
to
show
my
gratitude
to
you
bosom
heaved
and
tears
were
in
her
eyes
i
like
think
she
had
removed
her
things
now
revealing
the
natural
gracefulness
of
her
figure
priscilla
said
matt
looking
at
her
give
anything
if
i
could
he
paused
timidly
why
you
interrupted
priscilla
her
face
very
close
to
his
not
good
enough
yet
and
the
what
do
you
want
of
the
light
paint
so
well
by
night
the
color
looks
different
in
the
day
but
give
anything
to
be
able
to
paint
something
as
pretty
as
priscilla
swept
her
glass
aside
pettishly
sakes
what
a
boy
pictures
pictures
pictures
if
it
the
me
there
are
better
things
on
this
earth
than
pictures
matt
shook
his
head
with
a
sceptical
smile
priscilla
looked
disconcerted
you
say
i
was
prettier
than
a
picture
matt
different
he
parried
feebly
then
feeling
her
fascination
lulling
him
to
forgetfulness
of
the
price
to
be
paid
for
his
dinner
as
well
as
of
the
mute
appeal
of
his
damaged
designs
he
jumped
up
best
see
to
the
ceiling
before
too
late
i
wonder
if
kept
the
materials
down
but
i
cheat
the
this
is
but
it
right
you
priscilla
he
protested
mind
when
down
on
my
luck
you
shall
do
as
much
for
send
you
half
a
dollar
from
economy
he
said
resolutely
then
smiling
to
temper
his
ungraciousness
he
added
reckonings
make
long
friends
hey
as
an
old
deacon
i
knew
used
to
say
i
guess
go
now
for
you
got
to
go
aboard
till
nightfall
forgetting
the
ceiling
i
kind
want
to
touch
it
up
all
the
silly
boy
she
said
with
a
fond
smile
was
only
my
he
stared
at
her
in
reproachful
amazement
was
his
incurable
trust
in
humanity
always
to
be
shaken
thus
look
so
you
told
me
a
fib
think
i
was
to
let
you
fool
around
on
an
empty
stomach
you
told
me
a
the
boy
towered
over
her
like
an
irate
priscilla
had
a
happy
thought
you
told
a
lie
you
said
you
matt
looked
startled
but
that
that
was
different
he
stammered
again
see
it
tit
for
matt
pondered
in
silence
priscilla
rose
down
she
said
soothingly
and
the
boy
feeling
confusedly
guilty
let
himself
be
pressed
down
into
his
seat
priscilla
nestled
to
him
sharing
his
chair
and
pressing
her
soft
cheek
to
his
he
mad
with
his
poor
little
priscilla
she
cooed
he
be
angry
bless
his
handsome
matt
was
not
angry
any
longer
but
he
was
uncomfortable
he
tried
to
whip
up
his
sense
of
romance
to
feel
what
he
felt
in
reading
to
fancy
that
he
was
sitting
with
a
pensive
princess
in
a
cedar
grove
under
a
crescent
moon
but
he
could
only
feel
that
priscilla
was
a
real
terrestrial
person
and
mendacious
at
that
lips
sought
his
in
a
long
kiss
fond
me
matt
you
she
murmured
coaxingly
conscience
checked
conventional
response
he
faltered
slowly
guess
real
good
to
a
moment
later
the
door
opened
priscilla
sprang
up
hurriedly
and
to
be
doing
something
noisily
pulled
down
the
you
cynthia
she
said
carelessly
me
grumbled
the
old
woman
wanted
a
jiffy
just
lighting
candles
she
said
fumbling
about
for
them
in
the
darkness
she
had
herself
produced
early
croaked
cynthia
strang
wants
to
paint
there
enough
light
to
see
by
replied
priscilla
glibly
while
matt
felt
his
cheeks
must
surely
be
visible
by
the
light
of
their
own
glow
the
candles
were
lit
and
priscilla
ostentatiously
running
into
the
next
room
returned
with
a
sheet
of
white
paper
you
are
strang
she
cried
cheerfully
adding
in
a
whisper
be
back
presently
you
go
will
you
and
her
eyes
pleaded
amorously
no
sooner
had
priscilla
disappeared
than
perception
of
romance
in
the
position
began
to
return
but
it
was
an
impersonal
artistic
perception
he
was
but
a
spectator
of
the
situation
he
could
not
understand
his
own
apathetic
aloofness
he
walked
restlessly
about
the
room
trying
to
pump
up
byronic
emotion
but
finding
the
well
of
sentiment
strangely
dry
his
eye
wandered
to
the
blind
and
became
censoriously
absorbed
in
the
crude
flowers
and
figures
stamped
upon
the
background
he
studied
the
effects
of
the
on
the
glaring
coloration
noting
how
the
yellow
roses
had
turned
pink
then
face
flew
up
amid
the
flare
of
flowers
and
matt
seizing
the
sheet
of
paper
and
pulling
out
his
forgot
everything
else
even
the
artificial
light
in
the
task
of
expressing
priscilla
in
he
had
nearly
finished
the
sketch
which
glowed
with
dainty
vitality
though
the
figure
came
out
too
suddenly
the
sound
of
voices
broke
upon
his
ear
priscilla
and
cynthia
were
talking
outside
his
door
his
critical
situation
recurred
to
him
in
a
flash
his
broken
promise
to
the
captain
if
he
yielded
to
the
pertinacious
priscilla
the
imagination
might
enflame
the
crude
actuality
chilled
curiosity
alone
persisting
and
the
latent
puritan
leaped
up
at
bay
reminiscences
of
whispered
references
to
the
flesh
and
the
devil
resurged
with
all
that
mystic
flavor
of
chill
unspeakable
godlessness
that
attaches
to
sins
dimly
apprehended
in
childhood
thy
creator
in
the
days
of
thy
youth
seen
suddenly
in
red
letters
on
one
of
the
was
like
the
voice
of
a
minatory
providence
poor
priscilla
became
an
advancing
serpent
dragging
insidious
coils
he
shut
up
his
hastily
and
scribbling
beneath
the
sketch
priscilla
with
thanks
he
puffed
at
the
candles
only
one
went
out
priscilla
was
still
talking
outside
his
heart
was
thumping
with
excitement
as
he
added
in
a
corner
promised
the
captain
then
blowing
out
the
other
candle
he
waited
striving
to
draw
serener
breath
as
priscilla
still
dallied
without
only
a
blurred
glimmer
showed
through
the
isinglass
of
the
stove
door
the
room
was
quite
dark
he
began
to
hope
she
would
ascend
with
cynthia
and
leave
the
coast
temporarily
clear
but
at
last
only
step
receded
and
he
heard
priscilla
turning
the
it
was
an
anxious
moment
he
heard
her
exclamation
of
surprise
you
gone
to
bed
she
cried
he
held
his
breath
as
she
grazed
his
sleeve
in
the
darkness
then
he
glided
out
and
slid
boyishly
down
the
banisters
like
a
flash
there
was
a
gay
hubbub
of
voices
in
the
saloon
he
walked
unquestioned
into
the
street
then
ran
as
if
pursued
by
a
horde
of
amazons
till
he
reached
the
docks
and
saw
the
friendly
vessel
moored
against
the
wharf
remorse
for
his
balked
romance
set
in
severely
as
soon
as
the
bustle
of
loading
was
over
and
the
anchor
weighed
priscilla
took
on
the
halo
of
byronism
and
the
which
had
steadily
absented
itself
in
practice
often
during
that
miserable
voyage
he
called
himself
a
fool
and
a
milksop
for
the
passage
was
a
nightmare
of
new
duties
complicated
by
and
the
weakness
of
a
constitution
and
on
that
swinging
schooner
with
its
captain
the
mean
bedroom
he
had
deserted
showed
like
a
stable
paradise
but
blustrous
as
the
captain
was
by
the
side
of
the
blubbering
bludgeon
he
had
his
compensations
for
he
made
the
voyage
before
the
few
passengers
had
found
their
arrived
in
economy
matt
was
again
face
to
face
with
starvation
but
here
fortune
smiled
with
a
suspicion
of
humor
in
her
smile
and
having
already
climbed
masts
and
ladders
for
his
dinner
her
protégé
was
easily
tempted
to
seek
it
at
the
top
of
a
steeple
the
steeple
after
tapering
to
a
point
two
hundred
feet
high
was
crowned
by
a
ball
which
for
years
had
needed
regilding
unfortunately
the
architect
had
made
the
ball
almost
inaccessible
but
matt
being
desperate
undertook
the
job
the
breath
of
winter
was
already
on
the
town
a
week
more
and
the
whole
steeple
would
be
decorated
for
the
season
with
snow
so
offer
was
accepted
and
his
boots
equipped
with
creepers
the
young
begirt
with
ropes
made
the
ascent
safely
in
the
eye
of
the
admiring
populace
lowered
the
great
ball
and
then
himself
and
being
thereupon
given
board
and
lodging
and
materials
he
gilded
it
in
the
privacy
of
his
garret
thus
become
a
public
hero
matt
easily
got
through
the
winter
he
decorated
the
ceiling
of
the
hall
and
painted
a
portrait
of
the
member
of
the
house
of
assembly
a
burly
farmer
this
was
his
first
professional
experience
of
an
actual
sitter
and
he
found
himself
more
hampered
than
helped
by
too
close
contact
with
reality
however
a
touch
of
imagination
does
no
harm
to
a
portrait
and
matt
had
by
this
time
acquired
sufficient
experience
of
humanity
to
lean
to
side
even
apart
from
his
youthful
tendency
to
idealization
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
at
this
period
to
paint
anything
that
was
not
superficially
beautiful
or
picturesque
the
member
pronounced
the
portrait
and
gave
matt
a
bushel
of
potatoes
over
and
above
the
stipulated
price
which
was
board
and
lodging
during
the
period
of
painting
and
an
order
on
a
store
for
two
dollars
with
the
order
matt
purchased
a
pair
of
congress
or
boots
the
potatoes
he
swopped
for
a
box
of
paper
collars
from
economy
he
wrote
home
to
his
mother
and
received
an
incoherent
letter
in
which
she
denounced
the
deacon
by
the
aid
of
fulminant
texts
matt
sighed
impotently
pitying
her
from
his
deeper
experience
of
life
but
hoping
she
got
on
better
with
than
she
imagined
he
had
half
a
mind
to
look
up
his
folks
especially
poor
billy
but
just
then
he
got
an
order
from
the
brother
who
wrote
that
he
was
so
pleased
with
his
portrait
that
he
wished
matt
to
paint
his
he
added
that
although
he
had
not
seen
any
specimen
of
he
felt
confident
the
painter
of
that
portrait
would
be
a
competent
person
matt
accepted
the
new
task
with
mixed
feelings
and
got
so
many
other
commissions
from
the
shopkeepers
for
every
shop
had
its
movable
that
he
soon
saved
fifty
dollars
and
seemed
on
the
high
sea
to
england
and
his
uncle
he
had
fixed
three
hundred
dollars
as
the
minimum
with
which
he
might
safely
go
to
london
to
study
art
the
steerage
passage
would
cost
only
twenty
unfortunately
he
was
persuaded
to
invest
his
savings
in
a
partnership
with
a
yankee
and
to
travel
the
country
with
him
the
peddler
did
not
swindle
his
partner
merely
his
clients
but
matt
was
so
disgusted
that
he
refused
to
remain
in
the
business
thereupon
the
peddler
freed
from
the
obligations
of
partnership
treated
him
as
an
outsider
and
refused
to
return
his
principal
matt
thought
himself
lucky
to
escape
in
the
end
with
dollars
and
a
cleansed
conscience
he
went
back
to
but
taking
a
hint
from
the
yankee
continued
his
travels
and
became
a
he
hated
the
work
was
out
of
sympathy
with
his
prosaic
sitters
wondering
by
virtue
of
what
grace
or
loveliness
they
sought
survival
on
canvas
but
the
road
to
art
by
way
of
his
uncle
in
london
lay
over
their
painted
bodies
so
he
drudged
along
and
yet
when
the
sitter
was
dissatisfied
with
the
picture
it
was
generally
the
friends
who
persuaded
him
that
he
was
dissatisfied
and
when
matt
had
to
listen
to
the
fatuous
criticisms
of
farmers
and
the
artist
flared
up
and
more
than
once
the
boy
sacrificed
dollars
to
dignity
he
was
astonished
to
find
that
in
many
quarters
his
fame
had
preceded
him
and
more
astonished
to
discover
finally
that
the
advance
advertiser
was
his
late
partner
whether
the
yankee
compounded
thus
for
the
use
of
dollars
matt
never
knew
but
in
his
kinder
thought
of
the
cute
peddler
the
boy
came
to
think
himself
the
debtor
for
the
dollars
mounted
one
on
the
head
of
another
and
the
heap
rose
higher
and
higher
day
by
day
and
week
by
week
till
at
last
the
magic
three
hundred
began
to
loom
in
the
eye
of
hope
three
hundred
dollars
saved
by
the
sweat
of
the
brow
and
and
sanctified
by
the
blood
and
tears
of
youth
sweet
to
count
over
and
to
dream
over
and
to
pile
up
like
a
tower
to
scale
the
skies
and
so
the
great
day
drew
near
when
matt
strang
would
sail
across
the
atlantic
chapter
x
exodus
billy
strang
was
dreaming
happy
dreams
dreams
of
action
and
adventure
in
which
he
figured
not
as
the
morbid
cripple
but
as
the
hero
matt
was
generally
with
him
in
these
happy
of
sleep
dear
old
matt
who
had
become
a
creature
of
dream
to
his
waking
life
but
absorbed
as
billy
was
in
this
phantasmagoric
happiness
he
was
still
the
sport
of
every
unwonted
sound
from
the
real
world
his
tremulous
nerves
quivered
at
the
first
shock
ready
to
flash
back
to
his
brain
the
bleaker
universe
of
aches
and
regrets
and
rancorous
household
quarrels
he
sat
up
suddenly
with
a
premonition
of
something
strange
and
gazed
into
the
darkness
of
the
bedroom
seeing
only
the
dim
outline
of
the
other
bed
in
which
his
two
younger
brothers
slept
after
a
long
moment
of
mysterious
rustling
a
thin
ray
of
light
crept
in
under
the
door
then
the
handle
turned
very
softly
and
his
mother
glided
in
swiftly
bearing
a
candle
that
made
a
monstrous
shadow
follow
and
bend
over
her
she
was
fully
dressed
in
attire
wearing
her
bonnet
and
sacque
and
muffler
her
eyes
were
wide
with
excitement
and
shone
weirdly
and
the
whole
face
wore
an
uncanny
look
billy
trembled
in
cold
terror
his
mouth
opened
gaspingly
whispered
his
mother
putting
a
forefinger
to
her
lips
then
in
hurried
accents
she
breathed
get
up
and
dress
to
oncet
magnetized
by
her
face
he
slipped
hastily
from
the
bed
too
awed
to
question
she
breathed
again
wake
then
moving
with
the
same
noiseless
precipitancy
her
shadow
now
growing
to
giant
now
dwindling
to
dwarf
quick
children
she
whispered
shaking
them
the
two
younger
boys
sat
up
dazed
by
sleep
and
the
candle
and
were
silently
bundled
out
of
bed
yawning
and
blinking
and
automatically
commencing
to
draw
on
the
socks
they
found
thrust
into
their
hands
best
clothes
she
whispered
to
billy
throwing
open
the
cupboard
in
which
they
hung
the
action
seemed
to
loosen
his
tongue
it
sunday
he
breathed
is
a
holiday
put
them
on
quick
quick
she
replied
in
the
same
awful
whisper
are
out
of
the
land
of
bondage
in
haste
with
our
loins
girded
and
lo
in
the
in
every
house
there
was
one
she
set
down
the
candle
on
the
little
bare
wooden
table
where
it
gleamed
solemnly
in
the
gaunt
room
then
she
fell
to
feverishly
helping
the
children
to
dress
darting
violently
from
one
to
another
and
half
paralyzing
billy
whose
fumbling
freezing
fingers
could
not
keep
pace
with
her
frantic
impatience
he
dropped
a
boot
and
the
sound
seemed
to
echo
through
the
silent
house
like
a
diabolical
he
cowered
before
her
blazing
eyes
as
she
picked
up
the
boot
and
violently
dumped
his
foot
into
it
we
out
mother
he
said
so
as
not
to
scream
his
words
sounded
sinister
and
terrible
to
himself
go
see
if
the
girls
are
finished
she
took
up
the
candle
and
her
whisper
grew
sterner
make
a
sound
where
are
we
mother
he
said
to
detain
her
for
an
instant
home
up
the
position
and
for
the
first
time
the
exultation
in
her
voice
raised
it
above
a
whisper
then
putting
her
forefinger
to
her
lip
again
a
sound
she
breathed
menacingly
and
moved
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
her
face
set
and
shining
her
shadow
tumbling
grotesquely
on
the
walls
and
ceilings
billy
fell
back
on
the
bed
screaming
like
a
flash
his
mother
turned
her
hand
was
clapped
fiercely
over
his
mouth
little
devil
she
hissed
do
you
mean
by
light
the
light
he
gurgled
she
withdrew
her
hand
are
you
light
she
drew
up
the
blind
and
a
faint
moonlight
blurred
itself
through
the
frosty
glass
growed
up
now
you
big
booby
your
brothers
are
with
go
with
you
he
gasped
clutching
at
her
skirt
that
crutch
yours
you
pesky
eyesore
she
whispered
angrily
stay
with
the
little
uns
bless
their
brave
little
and
she
clasped
the
dazed
children
to
her
breast
lord
hes
punished
him
for
his
cruelty
to
you
finish
your
she
released
the
two
little
boys
and
glided
cautiously
from
the
room
holding
the
candle
low
so
that
her
great
wavering
shadow
darkened
the
room
even
before
the
thicker
horror
of
blackness
fell
when
she
was
gone
the
three
children
pressed
together
their
heartbeats
alone
audible
in
the
awful
stillness
they
were
too
bewildered
and
terrified
to
exchange
even
a
whisper
an
impalpable
oppression
brooded
over
the
icy
room
and
a
dull
torpor
possessed
their
brain
so
that
they
made
no
effort
to
understand
they
only
felt
that
something
unreal
was
happening
something
preternaturally
solemn
after
a
interval
of
darkness
the
mysterious
rustling
was
repeated
without
a
thin
line
of
light
crept
again
under
the
door
and
their
face
reappeared
gleaming
lurid
in
the
circle
of
the
the
two
girls
loomed
in
her
wake
a
big
and
a
little
both
wrapped
up
for
a
journey
but
shivering
and
yawning
and
rubbing
their
eyes
still
glued
together
by
sleep
the
younger
boys
who
had
remained
numb
guiltily
gave
the
last
hasty
touches
to
their
costume
under
the
irate
gaze
of
their
mother
but
face
had
grown
convulsed
his
mother
advanced
towards
him
dazzling
his
eyes
with
the
candle
and
her
face
and
bending
down
so
that
her
eyes
lay
almost
on
his
you
dare
to
have
a
fit
now
she
hissed
her
features
almost
as
agitated
as
his
own
cut
your
throat
like
cut
the
intensity
of
her
will
mastered
him
oversweeping
even
the
added
horror
of
her
words
and
combined
with
the
return
of
the
light
to
ward
off
the
threatened
paroxysm
he
dragged
on
his
only
a
few
minutes
had
elapsed
since
he
had
sat
up
in
bed
yet
it
seemed
hours
the
mother
stealthily
led
the
way
through
the
hushed
house
down
the
creaking
stairs
blowing
out
the
light
in
the
hall
when
she
opened
the
outer
door
the
cold
air
smote
their
faces
like
a
whip
as
she
was
cautiously
closing
the
door
a
dark
thing
ran
out
through
the
aperture
goes
his
soul
she
whispered
in
grim
exultation
but
it
was
only
sprat
the
creature
now
old
and
infirm
quietly
took
his
familiar
place
in
the
rear
of
the
procession
which
now
set
forth
over
the
frozen
moonlit
snow
under
the
solemn
stars
in
the
direction
of
cobequid
village
the
asleep
in
the
attic
built
over
the
kitchen
in
an
or
annex
to
the
main
house
heard
nothing
ruth
sleeping
the
sleep
of
virginal
health
and
innocence
in
her
dainty
chamber
was
deep
in
kindly
dreams
the
woman
led
the
way
noiselessly
but
rapidly
so
that
the
little
children
had
to
run
to
keep
pace
with
her
and
billy
dragged
himself
along
by
clinging
to
her
skirt
dreading
to
be
left
behind
in
the
great
lonely
night
the
road
led
downhill
towards
a
little
valley
in
which
stood
the
hidden
by
trees
but
as
they
drew
near
it
showing
dark
against
the
white
hill
that
rose
again
beyond
it
they
descended
towards
it
through
a
cutting
in
the
hill
lined
with
overhanging
curled
like
crystallized
waves
everything
seemed
dead
the
was
frozen
and
frozen
bundles
of
green
hides
stood
in
piles
against
the
front
of
the
mill
there
were
icicles
round
the
edges
of
the
sullen
cascade
that
fell
over
the
dam
the
was
a
sheet
of
ice
spotted
with
black
dots
where
showed
the
gloomy
water
below
the
procession
crossed
the
little
wooden
bridge
bordered
by
bare
willows
whose
branches
glittered
with
frost
and
then
the
rose
again
every
sound
was
heard
intensely
in
the
keen
air
the
rumbling
of
the
little
the
gurgling
of
the
stream
under
the
ice
the
frost
fusillade
of
the
zigzag
pole
fences
snapping
along
the
route
the
crunch
of
crisp
snow
under
their
feet
they
mounted
the
hill
and
reached
the
broad
flat
fields
that
stretched
on
white
and
bare
to
cobequid
the
last
inch
of
deacon
possessions
was
left
behind
then
the
leader
of
the
procession
slackened
her
pace
and
lifted
up
her
voice
in
raucous
thanksgiving
israel
of
the
lord
beloved
out
from
the
land
of
bondage
came
her
god
before
her
moved
an
awful
guide
in
smoke
and
then
sing
up
children
she
cried
bewildered
and
still
half
asleep
they
obeyed
in
bleating
quavering
tones
that
came
through
chattering
teeth
to
an
accompaniment
of
cloudy
breath
the
woman
and
her
children
passed
on
into
the
night
singing
amid
the
stretches
of
sky
and
space
they
seemed
a
group
of
black
insects
crawling
across
a
great
white
plain
abner
preep
coming
down
before
dawn
found
a
bunch
of
children
on
the
great
kitchen
settee
asleep
in
their
clothes
the
mother
sat
on
the
floor
before
the
open
stove
smiling
happily
and
muttering
to
herself
they
had
quietly
taken
possession
of
the
old
familiar
room
and
stirred
up
the
slumbering
fire
for
the
first
few
seconds
abner
wondered
if
he
was
dreaming
for
the
next
if
he
were
mad
but
another
look
at
the
crouching
woman
convinced
him
that
it
was
not
he
that
was
mad
while
a
phrase
from
her
babbling
lips
sent
something
of
the
truth
home
to
his
beating
heart
he
roused
harriet
and
broke
the
news
as
gently
as
time
permitted
the
brave
girl
bade
him
drive
at
once
to
deacon
while
she
kept
guard
over
her
mother
abner
thereupon
mounted
his
horse
to
save
time
and
galloped
to
the
farm
to
his
relief
he
found
the
deacon
little
injured
the
neglect
of
his
beard
had
been
salvation
it
had
sprouted
thick
and
tangled
about
his
throat
and
the
mad
woman
armed
with
a
blunt
knife
had
only
inflicted
a
leaving
the
trachea
unsevered
the
sleeping
man
suddenly
awakening
to
the
strange
spectacle
of
his
wife
in
attire
brandishing
a
knife
had
fainted
from
horror
and
loss
of
blood
but
presently
recovering
consciousness
he
had
clamored
for
ruth
and
with
her
help
bound
up
the
wound
already
half
stanched
by
the
clogging
beard
the
matter
was
kept
in
the
family
but
the
deacon
swore
he
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
the
woman
or
her
unmannerly
brood
beyond
paying
the
minimum
for
her
incarceration
where
she
could
do
no
more
mischief
and
so
abner
took
her
forthwith
by
sleigh
and
train
to
the
capital
and
placed
her
in
a
private
asylum
in
this
manner
strang
went
back
to
halifax
when
matt
heard
the
awful
tidings
his
crashed
and
fell
as
at
the
crack
of
doom
abner
preep
was
the
messenger
of
evil
for
painting
tour
had
brought
him
near
halifax
and
abner
thought
it
best
to
look
up
his
boyish
enemy
ere
he
went
back
home
beneath
all
the
tumult
of
consternation
in
breast
there
throbbed
an
undertone
of
remorse
a
vague
feeling
that
this
would
never
have
happened
had
he
been
on
the
spot
his
boyish
wilfulness
had
received
its
it
served
him
right
he
cried
with
irresistible
bitterness
when
he
heard
the
deacon
had
not
only
washed
his
hands
of
the
family
but
was
now
vindictively
pressing
abner
for
the
arrears
of
the
mortgage
interest
which
had
been
allowed
to
lapse
while
abner
was
building
up
his
position
abner
had
always
understood
that
strang
had
exacted
the
freedom
of
her
property
but
there
was
nothing
in
black
and
white
no
out
of
it
said
abner
gloomily
your
poor
father
must
hev
made
an
mess
of
it
fur
how
there
comes
to
be
so
much
to
pay
arter
all
these
years
fur
a
few
acres
of
ground
a
wretched
shanty
durned
if
i
can
make
cheated
father
you
may
depend
said
matt
hotly
go
as
fur
nor
thet
said
abner
right
to
call
a
man
a
thief
without
proof
anyway
got
to
stump
up
i
minded
it
in
an
ornery
way
though
i
got
two
babies
bless
their
souls
but
it
comes
hard
jest
now
with
five
extra
mouths
to
but
you
are
not
going
to
feed
them
then
of
nonsense
matt
said
abner
got
to
go
to
london
larn
told
me
all
you
got
some
your
picters
rael
beautiful
one
in
our
bedroom

your
not
mighty
good
of
you
said
matt
hoarsely
it
more
it
was
me
you
thet
thar
time
said
abner
smiling
evens
things
there
was
a
great
lump
in
throat
so
that
he
could
not
speak
he
held
out
his
hand
mutely
and
abner
took
it
and
they
gripped
each
other
so
heartily
that
the
tears
started
to
the
eyes
of
both
settled
said
abner
with
husky
cheeriness
only
to
beg
your
pardon
said
matt
recovering
his
voice
been
a
skunk
to
you
a
fact
but
not
going
to
behave
badly
again
just
raking
in
the
dollars
now

and
learning
painting
all
the
time
into
the
bargain
i
want
a
bit
to
go

london
and
put

two
hundred

the
least

and
that

old
scoundrel

i
can
easily

billy

i

and
my
fault
he
earn
anything
in
the
end
the
imperious
matt
had
his
way
and
while
the
boy
went
on
to
see
his
mother
abner
returned
home
with
the
situation
considerably
lightened
the
bearer
of
money
for
deacon
hailey
and
loving
messages
for
all
brothers
and
sisters
even
harriet
being
now
restored
to
grace
matt
found
his
mother
in
a
small
padded
room
in
a
house
that
stood
on
the
hill
overlooking
the
harbor
she
was
gazing
yearningly
seaward
and
tears
trickled
down
her
doleful
cheeks
matt
stood
silently
near
the
door
surveying
her
askance
with
aching
heart
abner
had
told
him
that
her
life
with
deacon
hailey
had
grown
a
blank
to
her
and
he
wondered
if
she
would
recognize
him
in
the
last
two
years
he
had
shot
up
from
a
hobbledehoy
into
a
tall
stalwart
youth
when
she
turned
her
head
at
last
and
espied
him
she
leaped
up
with
a
wild
cry
of
joy
and
folded
him
in
her
arms
she
cried
rapturously
own
davie
at
last
i
see
your
ship
come
a
nervous
thrill
ran
down
spine
as
he
submitted
to
her
embrace
the
separate
tragedies
of
his
lives
seemed
poignantly
knit
together
in
this
supreme
moment
so
strict
with
me
here
davie
she
said
me
away
from
my
folks
anywhere
where
we
can
be
happy
and
free
i
care
what
they
say
any
more
i
am
so
tired
of
all
this
humdrum
matt
pacified
her
as
best
he
could
and
promising
to
arrange
it
all
soon
left
her
his
heart
nigh
breaking
he
walked
about
the
bustling
streets
like
one
in
a
dream
resenting
the
sunshine
and
wondering
why
all
these
people
should
be
so
happy
again
that
ancient
image
of
his
dead
face
was
tossed
up
on
the
waves
of
memory
to
keep
company
henceforth
with
the
of
his
face
the
breakdown
of
his
ambition
seemed
a
petty
thing
beside
these
vaster
ironies
of
human
destiny
book
chapter
i
in
london
on
a
dull
february
day
a
respectably
clad
steerage
passenger
disembarked
at
southampton
with
little
luggage
and
great
hopes
he
was
only
twenty
but
he
looked
several
years
older
there
were
deep
traces
of
thought
and
suffering
in
the
face
bronzed
though
it
was
and
despite
the
vigorous
set
of
the
mouth
and
the
jaw
the
dark
eyes
were
soft
and
dreamy
he
was
except
for
a
mustache
which
combined
with
the
little
tangle
of
locks
on
his
forehead
to
suggest
the
artistic
temperament
and
to
repel
the
insinuation
of
rough
labor
radiating
from
his
sturdy
frame
and
bearing
matt
foot
had
touched
england
at
last
two
long
monotonous
years
of
steadfast
endurance
and
sordid
economies
two
years
of
portrait
and
sign
painting
interrupted
by
spells
of
at
two
and
a
half
dollars
a
day
had
again
given
him
the
mastery
of
three
hundred
dollars
despite
his
despatch
of
five
dollars
a
week
to
abner
preep
and
of
a
final
subsidy
of
one
hundred
dollars
to
bridge
over
the
time
till
he
should
have
a
footing
in
england
gradually
the
cloud
of
despondency
had
rolled
off
the
of
life
and
aspiration
would
not
be
denied
and
though
the
pity
and
terror
of
his
tragedy
had
tamed
his
high
spirit
and
snapped
the
springs
of
buoyancy
the
passion
for
painting
returned
with
an
intensity
that
dulled
him
to
every
appeal
of
the
blood
in
his
veins
and
with
it
a
haunting
fear
that
he
could
never
live
to
see
london
or
his
artist
uncle
that
he
would
die
in
the
flower
of
his
youth
all
his
possibilities
latent
so
impatient
was
he
to
give
this
fear
the
lie
that
he
suffered
a
vexatious
loss
through
his
hurry
to
realize
the
bills
and
the
goods
in
which
his
art
had
too
often
found
payment
when
the
steamer
floundered
into
a
field
of
ice
off
newfoundland
his
feeling
wellnigh
amounted
to
a
quiet
conviction
that
he
would
be
shipwrecked
in
sight
of
port
the
three
hundred
dollars
serving
but
to
sink
him
deeper
without
stopping
in
southampton
to
tempt
providence
he
went
straight
on
to
london
every
vein
in
him
pulsing
with
feverish
anticipations
of
mysterious
splendors
the
engine
panted
in
answering
exultation
and
the
rattle
of
the
carriages
was
a
rhythmic
song
of
triumph
at
last
he
was
approaching
the
city
of
his
dreams
the
mighty
capital
of
culture
and
civilization
where
art
was
loved
and
taught
and
honored
for
some
days
now
his
whole
being
had
been
set
in
this
key
he
sat
at
the
window
gazing
eagerly
at
the
sunless
landscapes
that
raced
past
him
gradually
he
became
aware
of
the
approach
of
the
monstrous
city
fields
were
interrupted
by
houses
later
houses
were
interrupted
by
fields
then
the
rural
touches
grew
fewer
and
fewer
and
at
last
he
sped
under
a
leaden
sky
amid
appalling
endless
everlasting
perspectives
of
and
sooty
tiles
and
dingy
houses
and
dead
walls
and
vomiting
columns
and
gasworks
and
factories
reeking
with
oppressive
odors
on
and
on
and
on
as
amid
the
infinities
of
a
mean
inferno
whirring
past
geometrical
rows
of
murky
backyards
with
and
and
fleeting
glimpses
of
grimy
women
and
children
and
slouching
men
thundering
over
bridges
that
spanned
gray
streets
relieved
by
motley
traffic
and
advertisement
hoardings
and
flashing
past
gaunt
mansions
of
poverty
bald
structures
with
peeling
fronts
and
bleared
windows
there
was
a
sombre
impressiveness
in
the
manifold
frowziness
the
squalid
monotony
it
was
the
sublime
of
the
sordid
fresh
as
matt
was
from
the
immensities
of
sea
and
sky
the
shabbiness
of
the
spectacle
caught
at
his
throat
he
thought
chokingly
of
the
unnumbered
unnoticed
existences
dragging
dismally
along
within
those
bleak
congested
barracks
what
had
all
this
to
do
with
art
the
glow
of
his
blood
died
away
to
be
rekindled
only
by
the
seething
streets
into
which
he
emerged
from
the
clangorous
maze
of
waterloo
station
the
throb
of
tumultuous
life
that
beat
as
a
drum
and
stirred
the
blood
as
a
trumpet
yet
he
had
not
come
up
to
conquer
london
but
to
sit
at
its
feet
his
bitter
experience
of
life
had
destroyed
every
vestige
of
cocksureness
almost
of
confidence
leaving
him
shy
and
sometimes
appalled
at
his
own
daring
as
he
realized
the
possibilities
of
he
knew
that
fame
and
money
were
the
guerdons
of
art
but
these
were
only
indirectly
in
his
mind
if
they
sometimes
flashed
to
his
heart
in
intoxicating
instants
of
secret
hope
he
was
too
full
of
the
consciousness
of
his
disadvantages
and
imperfections
to
think
much
of
anything
beyond
getting
the
necessary
training
far
down
the
vista
of
thought
and
years
lay
this
rosy
rim
of
splendor
a
faint
haze
dimly
discerned
but
the
joy
of
learning
and
practising
his
art
was
the
essence
of
his
yearning
and
yet
there
were
moments
like
this
of
feeling
london
under
his
foot
for
the
first
time
when
a
consciousness
of
power
welled
up
in
his
soul
a
sense
of
overflowing
energy
and
immovable
purpose
that
lifted
him
high
above
the
crowd
of
shadows
escaping
the
touts
and
cabmen
he
carried
his
valise
across
a
great
noiseful
bridge
to
the
nearest
hotel
intending
to
secure
a
base
of
operations
from
which
to
reconnoitre
london
before
looking
up
his
uncle
but
though
he
was
at
once
booked
for
a
room
the
genteel
air
of
the
place
with
its
customers
and
waiters
terrified
him
with
the
prevision
of
a
portentous
bill
he
would
have
backed
out
at
once
had
he
dared
but
he
thought
now
that
he
was
in
for
it
he
would
give
it
a
trial
he
took
only
his
breakfasts
there
however
though
the
unnatural
hour
at
which
he
took
them
made
him
an
object
of
suspicion
he
seemed
always
on
the
point
of
catching
an
early
train
his
other
meals
were
taken
at
those
modest
restaurants
where
twopence
is
not
a
tip
but
the
price
of
a
dish
and
the
menu
is
cut
up
into
slips
and
pasted
across
the
his
first
visit
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
was
to
the
national
gallery
not
only
to
fulfil
a
cherished
dream
but
to
see
his
pictures
to
talk
of
which
might
smooth
the
meeting
but
he
could
nowhere
come
across
the
works
of
matthew
strang
and
a
catalogue
he
could
not
afford
and
he
soon
forgot
the
unseen
pictures
in
the
emotions
excited
by
the
seen
which
plunged
him
into
alternate
heats
of
delight
and
chills
of
despair
despair
alone
possessed
him
at
first
in
his
passage
through
the
florentine
and
sienese
rooms
the
symbolic
figures
of
catholicism
had
scant
appeal
for
a
soul
which
in
its
emergence
from
puritan
swaddlings
had
not
opened
out
to
mediævalism
and
the
strange
draughtsmanship
blinded
him
to
everything
else
if
margaritone
or
even
botticelli
was
art
then
his
ideas
must
be
even
cruder
than
he
had
feared
he
was
relieved
to
find
as
he
continued
his
progress
that
it
must
be
the
madonnas
that
were
crude
for
he
was
apparently
following
the
evolution
of
art
but
the
sense
of
his
own
superior
technique
was
brief
despair
came
back
by
another
route
before
the
later
masters
he
was
reduced
to
a
worshipper
thrilled
to
tears
and
somewhat
to
his
own
astonishment
it
was
not
only
the
poetic
and
imaginative
that
compelled
this
religious
ecstasy
his
soul
was
astrain
for
high
vision
yet
it
was
seized
at
once
by
of
a
tailor
and
by
the
exquisite
modelling
though
he
did
not
know
the
word
for
it
of
the
head
in
his
of
an
to
the
young
nova
scotian
who
had
so
chafed
at
having
to
paint
uncouth
farmers
it
was
an
illumination
to
see
how
in
the
hands
of
a
teniers
or
above
all
a
rembrandt
the
commonplace
could
be
transfigured
by
force
of
technique
and
sympathy
and
yet
he
surrendered
more
willingly
to
the
romantic
held
by
the
later
the
of
velasquez
as
much
for
its
truculent
kingly
theme
as
for
the
triumphantly
subtle
coloring
which
got
the
effects
of
modelling
almost
without
the
aid
of
shadows
and
the
fever
of
inspiration
and
mastery
the
sense
of
flowing
paint
which
pervaded
and
animated
the
portrait
of
the
admiral
was
the
more
entrancing
because
of
the
romantic
figure
of
the
spanish
sailor
while
beside
merchant
with
its
haunting
suggestion
of
suffering
and
the
east
even
the
fine
vandyke
its
neighbor
seemed
to
lose
in
poetry
the
brilliant
and
seizing
qualities
had
his
first
vote
luminosity
of
color
richness
of
handling
grip
of
composition
all
that
leaped
to
the
eye
being
alone
he
had
the
courage
of
his
first
impressions
and
having
always
been
alone
he
had
the
broadness
that
is
clipped
by
school
the
beautiful
sense
of
form
and
landscape
in
appearing
to
mary
captivated
him
though
for
subject
he
preferred
the
and
he
was
equally
for
john
and
the
lamb
and
for
andrea
del
portrait
of
himself
for
of
a
he
wondered
wistfully
whence
took
the
glow
of
its
color
or
of
a
its
pathetic
grace
and
he
was
as
struck
by
the
fine
personal
if
sometimes
unsure
touch
of
gainsborough
as
by
the
vigorous
handling
and
extraordinary
painting
force
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
whose
children
alone
he
found
unreservedly
delicious
amid
many
sound
if
superficial
judgments
were
many
crude
admirations
and
condemnations
destined
to
undergo
almost
annual
revision
at
the
present
stage
of
his
growth
for
example
the
charming
correggio
was
his
ideal
of
an
artist
to
wit
a
skilful
painter
suffusing
poetical
themes
with
poetical
feeling
subject
counted
for
him
a
sympathetic
theme
seemed
to
him
of
the
essence
of
art
but
the
craftsman
in
him
was
not
to
be
suppressed
when
he
was
absorbed
in
julius
his
practical
self
suggested
that
the
reds
needed
varnishing
to
bring
up
the
head
from
the
background
and
though
the
fine
feeling
of
joseph
awoke
chords
of
religious
emotion
what
moved
him
most
was
the
modelling
of
the
foot
caressed
by
the
hair
his
emotion
subsided
in
the
study
of
the
mannerisms
his
heavy
blacks
and
shadows
his
delight
in
the
luminous
quality
of
of
a
was
modified
by
an
uneasy
conviction
that
the
left
hand
was
unnatural
even
in
portraits
the
hands
seemed
slightly
too
small
though
he
was
astonished
at
the
triviality
of
subject
in
gerard
and
poultry
shop
he
must
fain
admire
the
exquisite
quality
of
the
passages
and
the
loving
patience
of
the
infinite
touches
in
van
treatment
of
the
same
subject
he
found
a
resentful
pleasure
in
the
discovery
that
despite
the
marvellous
accuracy
of
the
dish
of
fish
and
the
vegetables
the
head
was
too
little
her
left
arm
too
heavy
and
too
big
for
the
right
her
flesh
more
like
fish
and
her
very
cat
purring
in
contented
ignorance
of
its
wrong
proportions
in
the
landscape
galleries
he
was
puzzled
by
the
old
classic
landscape
the
occasional
fineness
of
line
the
masterly
distribution
of
masses
did
not
counterbalance
his
sense
of
unreality
before
these
brown
trees
and
sombre
backgrounds
where
were
the
sunlight
and
atmosphere
of
nature
as
he
had
known
her
the
sky
over
all
subtly
interfused
with
all
the
living
hues
the
fresh
feeling
which
he
had
tried
to
put
into
his
own
humble
sketches
of
forest
and
by
virtue
of
which
he
found
more
of
the
great
mother
in
peter
de
pictures
of
the
courts
of
dutch
houses
than
in
all
the
templed
woodlands
of
the
period
but
constable
revealed
to
him
the
soul
of
loveliness
of
rural
england
setting
in
his
heart
a
pensive
yearning
for
those
restful
woods
and
waters
crome
touched
his
imagination
with
the
sweep
of
his
lonely
heaths
and
turner
dazzled
him
with
irisations
of
splendid
dream
and
subdued
him
with
the
mystery
and
poetry
of
sea
and
sky
and
the
total
effect
of
this
first
look
round
was
inspiration
over
all
the
whirling
confusion
of
the
appeal
of
so
many
schools
and
ages
over
all
his
bewilderment
before
early
italian
pictures
that
seemed
to
him
badly
drawn
and
modern
english
that
seemed
banal
over
all
his
dispiriting
diffidence
before
the
masterpieces
was
an
exultant
sense
of
brotherhood
as
of
a
soul
come
home
at
last
there
were
pictures
to
which
he
returned
again
and
again
with
a
feeling
of
reverential
kinship
a
secret
audacious
voice
whispering
that
he
understood
those
who
had
painted
them
that
he
too
was
of
their
blood
and
race
though
come
from
very
far
and
lonely
and
unknown
that
he
too
had
thrilled
with
the
beauty
and
mystery
of
things
that
he
too
had
seen
visions
and
heard
voices
quitting
the
gallery
with
regret
tempered
by
the
prospect
of
many
magic
hours
in
the
society
of
its
treasures
he
found
out
the
whereabouts
of
the
club
and
took
his
way
towards
bond
street
every
sense
thrilling
with
vivid
perceptions
receiving
pleasant
impressions
from
the
exhilarated
by
the
pretty
women
that
brushed
by
him
with
a
perfume
of
fashion
and
keenly
enjoying
the
roar
of
the
town
on
the
threshold
of
the
club
he
inquired
for
matthew
strang
the
eyed
him
surlily
and
said
there
was
no
such
member
the
world
grew
suddenly
dark
and
bleak
again
he
stammered
in
piteous
apology
that
strang
had
given
him
that
address
and
the
janitor
a
whit
softened
by
his
evident
distress
admitted
that
strang
was
sometimes
about
the
club
and
volunteered
to
send
the
boy
to
see
an
offer
which
matt
gratefully
accepted
with
a
sense
of
taking
alms
but
strang
was
not
on
the
premises
and
matt
was
further
driven
to
inquire
where
he
be
found
the
tired
of
him
replied
to
the
effect
that
he
was
not
keeper
and
that
it
was
not
unusual
to
look
for
gentlemen
in
their
own
homes
whereupon
matt
turned
miserably
away
too
disheartened
to
ask
where
his
own
home
was
situate
and
feeling
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
keep
watch
over
the
club
door
till
the
great
painter
should
appear
he
lingered
about
at
a
safe
distance
for
to
be
seen
by
the
were
terrible
scanning
with
eager
glances
the
faces
of
the
few
men
who
passed
through
the
swinging
glass
doors
his
imagination
glorifying
them
and
seeing
rather
halos
than
silk
hats
on
their
heads
but
at
last
the
futility
of
his
sentinelship
dawned
upon
him
he
could
not
be
sure
of
recognizing
his
uncle
he
could
not
accost
the
celestials
and
question
them
he
must
come
again
and
again
till
he
found
his
uncle
at
the
club
the
thought
of
facing
the
made
him
flinch
but
he
knew
the
road
to
art
was
thorny
and
precipitous
it
was
three
but
he
had
forgotten
to
lunch
now
that
his
emotions
had
been
chilled
he
remembered
he
was
hungry
he
looked
around
in
vain
for
a
mean
then
reluctantly
slipped
into
a
and
ordered
a
glass
of
ale
and
something
brown
and
dumpy
which
he
saw
under
a
glass
cover
the
wench
who
served
him
smiled
so
amiably
that
he
was
emboldened
to
ask
if
by
chance
she
knew
where
matthew
strang
lived
her
smile
died
away
and
nothing
succeeded
it
strang
the
painter
said
matt
with
a
ghastly
suspicion
that
the
girl
did
not
even
know
the
name
london
to
him
meant
largely
matthew
strang
it
was
to
matthew
strang
that
he
had
taken
his
ticket
and
booked
his
passage
it
was
to
get
to
matthew
strang
that
he
had
starved
and
pinched
himself
and
it
depressed
him
to
discover
the
limitations
of
fame
to
find
that
matthew
strang
was
not
hung
in
the
air
like
coffin
earth
and
heaven
for
all
to
see
the
directory
said
the
girl
lugging
it
down
when
she
perceived
that
the
young
man
with
the
curious
drawling
accent
was
not
quizzing
her
find
painters
in
the
trade
the
satire
was
unconscious
understanding
the
bulky
red
volume
but
dimly
matt
hunted
up
in
the
general
section
he
was
surprised
to
see
there
was
more
than
one
person
of
that
name
but
fortunately
there
was
only
one
matthew
strang
and
he
lived
in
a
side
street
off
cavendish
square
warmly
thanking
the
girl
matt
gulped
down
his
ale
and
hurried
out
to
inquire
the
way
munching
the
relics
of
the
cake
as
he
hastened
towards
the
goal
very
soon
scanning
the
numbers
his
eye
flashed
and
his
heart
leaped
up
there
it
was
the
magic
name
actually
earth
and
heaven
painted
above
a
surprised
he
came
to
a
the
window
was
one
which
would
have
arrested
him
in
any
case
for
it
was
illumined
with
paintings
and
engravings
and
through
the
doorway
matt
saw
enchanting
stacks
of
pictures
mounting
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
the
side
wall
was
a
gallery
of
oils
and
and
an
aroma
of
art
and
refinement
and
riches
seemed
over
everything
from
the
gold
of
the
frames
of
the
to
the
chaste
creamy
margins
of
the
engravings
he
entered
the
shop
with
beating
heart
his
eyes
lit
first
on
a
matron
in
a
cap
standing
at
the
far
end
of
the
shop
reverentially
surveying
a
faded
family
and
while
he
was
wondering
whether
she
was
the
wife
a
dapper
young
gentleman
installed
behind
a
broad
desk
near
the
door
startled
him
by
asking
his
business
he
coughed
uneasily
overcome
by
sudden
diffidence
the
series
of
barriers
between
him
and
his
uncle
gave
the
great
painter
an
appalling
aloofness
want
to
see
matthew
strang
he
stammered
the
dapper
young
gentleman
looked
inquiringly
towards
the
matron
this
gentleman
see
strang
madame
he
said
matt
noticed
that
he
wore
a
pearl
horseshoe
in
his
cravat
sir
be
seated
said
the
lady
with
grave
courtesy
and
a
pleasant
touch
of
foreign
accent
such
as
matt
had
heard
in
the
french
families
of
acadia
she
disappeared
for
a
moment
and
returned
in
the
wake
of
a
elderly
gentleman
with
interrogative
eyebrows
a
pointed
beard
and
a
velvet
jacket
the
first
sight
of
whom
gave
matt
the
of
yet
another
disappointment
but
though
his
keen
eye
soon
snipped
off
the
pointed
beard
and
wiped
off
the
sallowness
of
civilization
revealing
the
david
strang
interblent
with
the
matthew
his
remained
the
gap
between
him
and
this
fine
gentleman
and
great
artist
seemed
too
great
to
be
bridged
over
thus
suddenly
he
became
acutely
conscious
of
his
homely
clothes
of
his
coarse
unlettered
speech
of
the
low
menial
occupations
he
had
followed
he
saw
himself
furling
the
sail
and
carrying
the
hod
and
sawing
the
wood
he
felt
himself
far
below
the
dapper
young
shopman
with
the
pearl
and
his
throat
grew
parched
and
his
eyes
misty
sir
said
his
uncle
rubbing
his
hands
with
chilling
geniality
can
i
have
the
pleasure
of
doing
for
you
in
that
instant
matt
perceived
all
the
perversity
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
he
remembered
he
had
flown
in
the
face
of
his
kind
advice
and
had
not
even
apprised
him
of
his
departure
from
america
want
to
buy
some
colors
he
faltered
his
eyebrows
mounted
do
not
sell
colors
young
man
he
said
frigidly
thought
matt
stammered
matthew
strang
contemptuously
turned
on
his
heel
and
withdrew
his
nephew
lingered
desperately
in
the
shop
without
the
strength
either
to
go
or
to
stay
the
lady
who
had
half
followed
her
husband
turned
back
hesitatingly
and
with
reassuring
sweetness
said
will
get
colors
near
at
hand
in
oxford
street
we
only
sell
under
her
penetrating
sympathy
matt
found
courage
to
say
sorry
strang
got
echoed
madame
opening
her
eyes
as
with
a
vision
of
broadcloth
brushing
against
wet
canvases
mean
angry
said
matt
confusion
streaking
his
own
face
with
red
i
remember
now
said
madam
sweetly
an
american
it
was
in
america
that
i
heard
of
strang
he
replied
slowly
striving
to
accentuate
his
words
as
though
he
were
reading
them
from
a
madame
flushed
now
i
heard
of
his
fame
as
a
her
eyes
sparkled
roses
leaped
into
her
blond
cheeks
always
told
him
his
work
was
admirable
she
cried
in
exultant
excitement
he
is
so
easily
matt
thrilled
with
a
sense
of
the
greatness
you
see
he
said
with
a
quaver
of
emotion
in
his
voice
was
just
wild
to
see
am
so
glad
cried
madame
with
a
charming
smile
will
go
and
tell
my
husband
he
really
must
see
you
matthew
she
called
out
tremulously
fluttering
towards
the
passage
the
saturnine
figure
in
the
velvet
coat
descended
again
must
talk
to
the
young
gentleman
dear
he
has
heard
of
your
fame
in
matthew
interrogative
eyebrows
reached
their
highest
point
and
face
got
more
streaked
than
ever
he
felt
he
was
in
a
false
position
heard
of
you
from
my
father
he
said
hurriedly
is
the
price
of
this
he
asked
in
his
confusion
half
turning
towards
the
shopman
etching
of
three
guineas
he
added
gauging
his
man
have
a
photogravure
of
the
same
subject
a
little
smaller
for
half
a
father
repeated
strang
gruffly
was
a
brother
artist
i
matt
would
have
given
much
to
say
he
was
not
an
artist
but
a
brother
but
he
replied
instead
not
exactly
he
was
a
he
felt
somehow
as
if
the
whole
guilt
of
his
calling
rested
upon
himself
and
it
was
mean
of
him
to
cross
the
atlantic
to
impose
some
of
it
on
the
dignified
figure
before
him
i
love
soldiers
murmured
madame
strang
matt
felt
things
were
now
entangled
beyond
the
possibility
of
even
future
extrication
so
he
desperately
consented
to
purchase
the
photogravure
threw
down
a
sovereign
and
snatching
up
the
change
and
the
hurried
from
the
establishment
a
charming
young
man
said
madame
strang
but
matthew
strang
tapped
his
forehead
significantly
always
will
run
yourself
down
dear
murmured
madame
replied
matthew
strang
in
low
solemn
tones
fellow
is
either
a
fool
or
a
left
sixpence
on
the
desk
broke
in
the
voice
of
the
shopman
a
fool
it
is
enough
for
me
to
live
in
my
son
he
has
advantages
which
i
was
dear
boy
breathed
madame
the
extravagant
purchaser
of
the
divided
the
rest
of
his
week
between
the
national
gallery
where
he
concluded
his
uncle
had
not
yet
been
canonized
and
the
streets
of
london
which
he
explored
fearlessly
in
a
few
days
of
industrious
investigation
he
saw
more
than
many
a
londoner
sees
in
a
lifetime
he
had
experience
of
the
features
and
of
peckham
rotherhithe
clapton
westminster
covent
garden
the
east
india
docks
the
tower
wandering
wherever
the
shapeless
city
stretched
its
lubber
limbs
and
seeing
things
and
places
that
made
him
glad
of
the
protection
of
the
pistol
he
carried
in
his
the
very
formlessness
of
the
city
fascinated
even
while
it
dazed
him
he
ceased
to
wonder
that
artists
found
inspiration
in
this
atmosphere
in
which
the
fog
itself
seemed
but
the
visible
symbol
of
the
innumerable
mysterious
existences
swarming
in
its
obscure
vastness
the
unexpected
was
everywhere
green
closes
in
the
heart
of
commerce
quiet
quadrangles
in
the
byways
of
fleet
street
quaint
old
churches
by
the
bawling
behind
stately
mansions
great
parks
set
in
deserts
of
arid
poverty
bustling
docks
hidden
away
in
back
streets
and
elegant
villas
at
the
end
of
drab
dismal
thoroughfares
redolent
of
slush
and
and
and
fried
fish
miles
were
of
light
account
to
one
who
had
lived
in
a
land
of
great
spaces
yet
matt
was
wearied
by
the
lengthy
sweep
of
the
great
arteries
and
the
multiplicity
of
their
ramifications
by
this
vastness
that
was
but
reiterated
narrowness
in
its
lack
of
the
free
open
horizons
to
which
his
eye
was
used
but
the
titanic
city
awoke
strange
responses
in
his
soul
something
in
him
vibrated
to
the
impulse
of
the
endless
panorama
often
his
fingers
itched
for
the
brush
as
if
to
translate
into
color
and
line
all
this
huge
pageant
of
life
for
the
spell
of
youthful
poesy
was
still
on
his
eyes
and
if
he
could
not
see
london
as
he
had
seen
his
native
fields
and
sky
and
ocean
all
fresh
and
pure
and
beautiful
if
in
the
crude
day
its
sordid
streets
seemed
labyrinths
in
an
underworld
unlovely
intolerable
there
were
atmospheres
and
lights
in
which
it
still
loomed
upon
his
vision
through
the
glamour
of
fantasy
and
chiefly
at
night
when
the
mighty
city
brooded
in
sombre
majesty
magnificently
transfigured
by
the
darkness
and
the
solemn
river
stretched
in
twinkling
splendor
between
enchanted
warehouses
or
shadowed
itself
with
the
inverted
architecture
of
historic
piles
or
lapped
against
the
gray
old
tower
dreaming
of
ancient
battle
but
he
could
only
take
rough
pencil
or
mental
notes
of
the
romance
of
it
all
and
it
was
almost
always
the
fantastic
that
touched
his
imagination
and
found
expression
in
the
pictorial
of
his
lurid
splotches
of
sunset
against
tall
grimy
chimneys
tawny
barges
gliding
over
black
shot
with
quivering
trails
of
liquid
gold
from
the
morning
sun
ragged
rembrandtesque
figures
asleep
under
glooming
railway
arches
over
which
trains
flew
with
shining
windows
street
perspectives
at
twilight
with
strange
livid
skies
filmy
evening
rain
blurring
the
lights
of
the
town
to
a
tender
haze
late
omnibuses
tearing
by
glistering
moonlit
pavements
and
casting
the
shadows
of
the
outside
passengers
on
the
sleeping
houses
foggy
forenoons
with
the
eye
of
day
inflamed
and
swollen
in
the
yellow
heaven
with
his
purchase
of
the
on
the
other
hand
he
was
not
greatly
taken
despite
its
sentiment
he
had
seen
too
much
of
peasants
he
had
himself
stooped
over
the
furrows
when
his
heart
was
elsewhere
his
soul
turned
from
the
mean
drudgeries
and
miseries
of
the
human
lot
yearning
for
the
flash
of
poetry
the
glow
of
romance
the
light
of
dream
in
spite
of
his
boarding
out
his
bill
for
the
bed
breakfast
and
attendance
reached
as
far
as
a
terrifying
total
that
drove
him
headlong
into
the
frowsiest
to
be
found
in
the
slums
round
holborn
here
he
spent
a
wretched
interminable
night
provoked
by
insects
and
mysterious
noises
into
dressing
again
and
keeping
his
hand
on
his
pistol
as
he
sat
shivering
on
a
chair
the
staircases
resounded
with
the
incessant
tramp
of
feet
mounting
and
descending
and
there
were
bursts
of
rowdy
laughter
and
blows
and
tipsy
jeers
and
once
his
locked
door
was
shaken
and
matt
thought
he
had
fallen
into
a
den
and
trembled
for
his
savings
in
the
morning
he
called
for
his
account
and
left
not
without
having
discovered
the
real
character
of
the
place
into
which
he
had
strayed
after
some
trouble
he
chanced
upon
a
clean
furnished
room
in
the
same
neighborhood
for
four
shillings
and
sixpence
a
week
attendance
included
it
was
a
back
room
on
the
third
floor
and
it
gave
on
a
perspective
of
tiles
and
shabby
plaster
and
the
evidences
of
in
the
doors
and
windows
discomforted
the
whilom
apprentice
but
he
calculated
that
for
less
than
twenty
of
his
pounds
he
would
have
a
foothold
in
london
for
a
year
he
wellnigh
cried
to
think
of
the
weeks
he
had
lost
in
that
week
of
hotel
luxury
on
sixpence
a
day
he
could
sustain
life
on
ninepence
he
could
live
in
clover
why
even
making
lavish
allowance
for
the
technical
expenses
of
which
his
uncle
had
warned
him
he
would
easily
be
able
to
stay
on
for
a
whole
year
in
a
year
a
year
of
ceaseless
painting
what
might
he
not
achieve
ah
what
hopes
harbored
what
dreams
hovered
in
that
bleak
little
room
the
vague
troubled
rumor
of
the
great
city
rolled
up
in
inspiring
mystery
the
light
played
with
instructive
fascination
upon
the
sooty
tiles
high
over
the
congested
chaos
of
he
saw
the
evening
mists
rifted
with
sunset
and
on
starry
nights
he
touched
the
infinite
through
his
rickety
casement
chapter
ii
only
where
to
learn
there
was
the
rub
he
had
looked
to
his
uncle
to
put
him
in
the
way
of
instantly
acquiring
art
and
here
had
he
wasted
a
week
without
acquiring
even
information
but
in
the
british
museum
he
lighted
upon
young
men
and
women
drawing
from
the
antique
and
entering
into
conversation
with
the
shabbiest
of
the
men
who
was
working
at
the
head
of
a
roman
emperor
in
chalk
pecking
at
it
with
a
pointed
pellet
of
bread
he
learned
that
the
roman
head
was
intended
in
alliance
with
the
torso
of
a
greek
to
force
the
doors
of
the
royal
academy
schools
the
privileges
of
which
gratuitous
establishment
the
aspirant
duly
recounted
but
the
examination
would
not
take
place
for
some
time
and
matt
though
he
felt
it
hard
to
have
to
pay
fees
elsewhere
in
the
meantime
was
secretly
pleased
at
being
able
to
shelve
temporarily
the
thought
of
partaking
in
this
examination
for
the
roman
head
was
appallingly
stippled
and
the
student
said
he
had
been
at
work
on
it
for
four
months
and
evidently
meditated
touching
and
retouching
it
till
the
very
eve
of
the
examination
matt
did
not
think
he
could
ever
muster
sufficient
interest
in
roman
emperors
to
live
with
the
head
of
one
for
more
than
a
week
his
heart
sank
at
the
thought
of
what
he
might
have
to
go
through
to
please
professors
and
examiners
but
he
would
have
willingly
tried
his
hand
at
copying
a
bust
had
not
the
student
informed
him
he
must
apply
for
permission
and
give
a
reference
to
a
reputable
householder
with
the
exception
of
his
unclaimed
uncle
matt
knew
no
one
reputable
or
disreputable
householder
or
vagrant
but
he
obtained
from
the
shabby
delineator
of
the
roman
emperor
the
address
of
a
cheap
good
though
he
found
to
his
dismay
that
even
at
the
cheapest
he
could
only
afford
to
take
the
night
class
from
seven
to
ten
three
times
a
week
he
saw
he
would
have
to
study
form
apart
from
natural
color
and
apply
during
the
days
the
preachings
of
the
three
nights
impatient
and
holding
his
tight
against
his
palpitating
heart
he
set
out
that
very
night
to
join
the
class
but
losing
himself
in
a
labyrinth
of
squares
exactly
alike
did
not
find
the
school
till
seven
passing
through
an
open
door
marked
academy
of
in
ugly
and
faded
lettering
he
found
himself
in
a
long
gloomy
passage
that
led
away
from
the
rest
of
the
house
and
following
the
indication
of
a
dirty
finger
painted
on
the
wall
he
stole
cautiously
along
the
deserted
corridor
which
grew
momentarily
drearier
as
it
receded
from
the
naked
jet
of
gas
in
the
doorway
till
it
reached
its
duskiest
at
the
point
where
it
was
bordered
by
a
pair
of
matt
peered
eagerly
into
their
shadowy
depths
which
seemed
to
contain
coals
and
a
bicycle
and
litter
as
well
as
clothing
and
to
exhale
a
flavor
of
ancient
stuffiness
but
he
could
detect
no
movement
among
the
congested
overcoats
at
last
at
the
end
of
the
passage
he
stumbled
against
a
boy
in
buttons
kneeling
with
his
eye
to
the
of
a
door
apologetically
he
asked
the
boy
if
this
was
and
the
boy
jumping
up
quickly
told
him
to
walk
in
and
retreated
in
haste
matt
opened
the
door
a
wave
of
insufferably
hot
air
reeking
of
tobacco
smote
his
face
and
his
nostrils
a
glare
of
light
dazzled
his
eyes
he
was
vaguely
aware
of
a
great
square
room
crowded
with
young
men
in
uncouth
straw
hats
sitting
or
standing
at
work
in
their
before
easels
but
the
whole
scene
was
a
blur
compared
with
the
central
point
that
stood
out
in
disconcerting
clearness
immediately
facing
him
on
a
platform
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
a
nude
woman
was
standing
he
started
back
shocked
and
was
meditating
flight
when
a
student
near
him
growled
to
him
to
shut
the
door
he
obeyed
and
had
an
instant
of
awful
loneliness
and
embarrassment
amid
this
crowd
of
gifted
strangers
in
the
rear
of
which
he
stood
under
arm
wondering
why
nobody
challenged
his
entry
and
where
grainger
was
turning
to
look
for
him
he
upset
a
rickety
easel
and
a
disengaged
stool
both
of
which
seemed
to
topple
over
at
the
slightest
touch
but
his
awkwardness
saved
the
situation
the
owner
of
the
easel
was
and
perceiving
he
was
a
bade
him
seat
himself
on
the
stool
and
fix
up
an
easel
next
to
him
the
number
painted
on
the
oilcloth
of
the
floor
being
unappropriated
as
matt
had
no
canvas
he
even
went
outside
to
buy
him
one
for
from
the
boy
in
buttons
matt
handed
him
the
money
with
a
feeling
of
eternal
gratitude
while
his
amiable
fellow
was
thus
busied
in
his
behalf
the
new
keen
eye
absorbed
the
scene
in
detail
a
great
square
dusty
room
rimmed
as
to
the
roof
by
skylights
and
lighted
from
above
by
a
great
circular
round
two
of
the
walls
patched
here
and
there
by
the
crumbling
away
of
the
plaster
ran
a
rack
on
which
innumerable
canvases
and
were
stacked
and
underneath
the
rack
a
streak
of
wood
permeated
the
plaster
to
hold
the
pins
by
which
crude
sketches
were
fastened
up
evidently
for
criticism
here
and
there
hung
notices
of
the
meetings
of
sketching
club
mixed
up
with
photographs
and
advertisements
of
studios
and
of
a
drawing
competition
instituted
by
the
proprietors
of
a
soap
and
the
mural
ornamentation
was
completed
by
clever
nude
studies
rapid
de
of
the
visiting
artists
as
matt
discovered
later
everywhere
about
the
floor
were
canvases
boards
and
an
unstable
assortment
of
easels
donkeys
quaintly
carved
chairs
and
stools
high
and
low
upon
which
last
students
of
all
figures
and
complexions
some
of
them
smoking
sat
perched
crowned
with
the
uncouth
straw
hats
to
keep
the
glare
out
of
their
eyes
and
reduced
to
the
by
the
heat
from
so
many
lights
and
breaths
the
pendent
being
supplemented
by
the
paraffine
lamp
that
lighted
a
shadowy
corner
where
a
skull
grinned
on
a
shelf
and
by
the
big
fire
that
was
needed
to
keep
the
model
from
shivering
on
the
throne
where
she
stood
statuesque
against
the
white
background
of
a
dirty
sheet
her
head
resting
against
her
arm
and
from
everything
breathed
an
immemorial
dust
from
the
fire
in
the
centre
of
the
wall
an
impalpable
ash
seemed
to
drift
dust
covered
the
and
coated
the
bottles
of
and
fixative
and
the
boxes
of
charcoal
that
stood
upon
it
dust
draped
in
gray
the
dilapidated
that
leaned
drunkenly
against
the
right
side
of
the
throne
in
the
corners
of
the
room
the
dust
had
an
air
of
legal
possession
as
if
the
statute
of
limitations
had
secured
it
against
the
broom
there
were
dusty
mysteries
doubled
up
on
shelves
a
visible
skin
suggesting
infinite
romantic
possibilities
for
the
others
and
within
a
dusty
barrel
in
a
corner
near
him
matt
saw
dusty
bits
of
velvet
and
of
strange
splendid
stuffs
which
he
divined
were
for
costume
models
and
the
floor
seemed
a
land
of
lost
and
forgotten
fragments
of
charcoal
and
then
his
heart
gave
a
great
leap
for
his
eye
returning
timidly
to
the
throne
where
it
had
scarcely
dared
as
yet
to
rest
encountered
a
head
bending
over
a
in
the
compartment
of
the
floor
to
the
left
of
it
surely
it
could
be
no
other
than
grainger
himself
that
thin
austere
man
with
the
big
bald
forehead
and
the
air
of
wellington
and
matt
thrilled
with
proportionate
reverence
and
turned
his
eye
away
as
if
dazzled
to
repose
it
on
the
inchoate
paintings
of
the
students
who
were
squinting
scientifically
at
the
model
and
measuring
the
number
of
heads
with
sticks
of
charcoal
or
their
some
had
her
large
some
small
some
turned
her
head
this
way
some
that
some
were
painting
her
some
drawing
her
each
from
his
point
of
sight
as
soon
as
his
own
canvas
arrived
altogether
forgetting
his
startled
modesty
in
the
delightful
interest
of
the
work
he
fell
to
touching
in
the
head
with
rapid
strokes
of
a
flowing
brush
the
woman
vanished
in
the
form
what
a
privilege
to
enjoy
and
reproduce
those
beautiful
curves
those
subtle
fleshtones
those
of
cream
and
rose
seen
under
gaslight
are
you
about
said
his
mentor
presently
her
portrait
he
replied
pausing
with
painful
foreboding
the
charcoal
outline
charcoal
outline
you
paint
her
without
sketching
her
first
in
i
asked
matt
with
a
sudden
remorseful
recollection
of
his
first
sitter
the
acadian
legislator
whose
portrait
had
paved
his
way
to
he
hastened
to
efface
his
ignorance
with
a
and
to
obliterate
it
with
a
rag
moistened
with
turpentine
but
he
was
frightened
and
nervous
and
denuded
of
confidence
in
himself
and
when
he
attempted
to
outline
the
figure
the
charcoal
boggled
at
the
greasy
surface
of
the
canvas
and
while
he
was
wrestling
with
his
medium
he
became
conscious
that
the
great
grainger
was
behind
him
and
a
nervousness
that
he
had
not
felt
when
he
pointed
his
gun
at
the
bear
in
his
forest
home
paralyzed
his
hand
grainger
stood
for
some
moments
watching
his
fumbling
strokes
then
he
said
want
to
join
the
life
class
matt
flushing
furiously
stammered
an
affirmative
you
think
better
begin
with
the
antique
asked
grainger
matt
murmured
that
he
care
about
the
antique
anyhow
and
grainger
shook
his
austere
head
no
getting
on
without
slogging
away
no
good
shirking
the
the
living
figure
is
all
subtle
lines
you
expect
to
be
equal
to
them
without
years
of
practice
at
the
antique
and
matt
plucked
up
courage
to
guess
that
he
would
have
another
try
at
the
figure
and
grainger
having
pocketed
a
fees
moved
off
leaving
matt
amazed
at
his
own
temerity
you
think
be
annoyed
if
i
stay
on
here
he
asked
his
mentor
as
he
resumed
his
work
with
the
determination
to
prove
himself
not
unworthy
of
the
privilege
you
want
to
chuck
your
money
away
your
lookout
said
his
mentor
candidly
hurt
he
say
anything
matter
what
he
says
not
up
to
queried
matt
astonished
he
a
great
painter
the
student
laughed
silently
great
painter
keep
a
school
he
said
only
the
failures
that
do
that
how
can
one
learn
asked
matt
in
dismay
well
we
have
a
visitor
once
a
week
rather
a
good
man
tarmigan
not
an
but
he
can
knock
off
a
head
in
twenty
the
what
are
they
for
inquired
matt
only
partially
reassured
show
said
the
young
man
smartly
a
green
un
to
think
that
going
to
get
academicians
for
thirty
bob
a
month
got
to
go
to
the
academy
schools
if
you
want
and
then
the
chaps
say
not
much
use
most
of
them
are
out
of
date
and
you
get
a
different
man
every
month
who
contradicts
all
the
others
a
fellow
i
know
says
the
best
of
the
visitors
is
marmor
but
awfully
noisy
and
facetious
and
claps
you
on
the
back
and
tells
you
a
story
and
forgets
to
criticise
and
then
peters
he
sighs
and
says
tender
and
you
think
improved
till
you
hear
him
say
to
the
next
man
too
the
chief
advantage
of
going
to
a
school
is
that
you
get
a
model
which
you
afford
to
hire
for
yourself
and
you
learn
from
the
other
fellows
and
then
of
course
composition
jolly
good
for
by
this
time
matt
had
sketched
his
outline
and
he
was
about
to
resume
the
brush
when
the
clock
struck
eight
the
model
stretched
herself
and
retired
behind
the
dirty
sheet
which
now
operated
as
a
screen
and
there
was
a
rising
a
putting
down
of
palettes
each
with
its
brushes
stuck
idly
in
its
an
outburst
of
exclamations
a
striking
of
matches
a
mechanical
rolling
of
cigarettes
a
sudden
lowering
of
the
lights
and
a
general
air
of
breaking
up
over
already
he
asked
in
a
disappointed
tone
only
turning
the
gas
down
for
coolness
while
the
model
has
a
rest
you
see
she
stand
two
hours
straight
off
the
i
guess
not
said
matt
and
then
repented
of
having
said
for
he
was
trying
to
prune
away
his
humble
expressions
and
to
remember
the
idioms
of
the
educated
people
with
whom
his
new
life
was
bringing
him
into
contact
must
be
awful
hard
he
added
especially
in
a
school
where
a
lot
of
chaps
are
working
at
once
and
she
rest
a
limb
because
somebody
might
just
be
painting
it
one
woman
told
me
rather
scrub
floors
so
as
to
feel
her
limbs
moving
about
but
posing
pays
better
this
is
a
new
model
first
time
been
here
pity
women
with
such
fine
figures
got
prettier
faces
have
a
cigarette
thanks
said
matt
smoke
did
smoke
once
but
i
gave
it
matt
did
not
like
to
confess
it
was
because
he
could
not
afford
the
luxury
be
an
artist
without
tobacco
said
his
mentor
laughingly
the
model
just
go
and
get
her
he
went
up
to
the
model
who
had
and
seated
herself
at
ease
upon
the
throne
where
a
group
of
students
with
pipes
or
cigarettes
in
their
mouths
was
in
conversation
with
her
matt
followed
his
mentor
interested
in
this
new
specimen
of
humanity
and
thinking
that
he
would
prefer
to
paint
her
as
she
was
sitting
then
nude
in
that
dim
mysterious
light
surrounded
by
figures
in
tropic
headgear
her
face
alive
her
feet
crossed
gracefully
playing
a
part
in
a
real
scene
yet
withal
unreal
to
the
point
of
grotesqueness
sat
a
lot
for
she
was
saying
when
matt
came
up
stand
every
morning
for
the
portrait
of
letty
gray
the
for
the
academy
she
come
much
and
awfully
unpunctual
of
course
only
for
the
you
in
the
grosvenor
gallery
last
summer
asked
a
bald
man
i
was
began
the
model
proudly
thought
i
recognized
you
said
the
man
with
an
air
of
ancient
friendship
i
was
also
on
the
line
in
the
big
room
she
added
of
the
and
i
got
into
the
royal
institute
as
well
wailing
for
her
demon
here
you
are
then
said
a
young
man
producing
an
illustrated
catalogue
said
she
turning
over
a
few
pages
my
husband
sardanapalus
they
often
have
him
at
the
academy
schools
she
wound
up
with
conscious
pride
perhaps
we
shall
get
him
here
one
week
said
the
man
while
his
mentor
was
taking
down
her
address
matt
looked
round
the
room
the
austere
grainger
with
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
was
reading
a
yellowish
paper
embellished
with
comic
cuts
most
of
the
students
were
moving
about
looking
at
one
easels
the
work
on
which
with
few
exceptions
matt
was
surprised
to
find
mediocre
a
few
sat
stolidly
humped
on
their
stools
feet
on
rail
and
pipe
in
mouth
one
group
was
examining
photographs
which
its
central
figure
had
taken
and
which
he
loudly
declared
knocked
the
painting
of
the
fishtown
school
to
fits
from
all
sides
the
buzz
of
voices
came
through
the
stifling
smoky
darkened
atmosphere
you
seen
new
picture
another
s
contemptuously
replied
a
very
young
man
seated
smoking
a
very
long
pipe
before
a
very
indifferent
canvas
do
you
mean
bubbles
asked
a
you
noticed
he
answered
with
ineffable
disdain
swinging
his
arm
in
illustration
the
lines
of
his
compositions
are
all
curly
they
always
make
s
thought
they
always
made
interjected
a
wag
and
all
except
the
very
young
man
laughed
is
gone
on
whistler
observed
a
student
compassionately
admire
him
admitted
the
very
young
man
candidly
i
say
the
end
of
reserved
for
bubbles
laughed
the
student
the
end
of
art
bubbles
said
another
man
of
course
put
in
the
wag
and
say
grainger
says
miss
hennery
used
to
work
in
his
day
class
said
a
handsome
young
irishman
strolling
up
with
a
bag
of
cakes
from
which
the
model
had
just
helped
herself
in
the
pervasive
spirit
of
i
see
anything
to
boast
of
in
that
pronounced
bubbles
puffing
at
his
long
hookah
only
a
feeble
female
imitation
of
tarmigan
her
muddy
and
her
brother
comes
into
all
her
suppose
she
afford
models
said
the
irishman
charitably
a
bubbles
accepted
and
the
helped
to
empty
the
bag
matt
moved
back
towards
his
easel
passing
a
little
dark
man
with
a
mane
who
was
explaining
to
a
derisive
audience
that
the
reason
he
went
to
was
to
study
character
and
brushing
by
a
weedy
giant
who
was
boasting
that
he
hardly
ever
went
to
bed
so
tied
was
he
to
his
anatomy
during
his
progress
a
meagre
wrinkled
old
man
with
hair
and
a
stoop
approached
him
and
said
in
a
husky
whisper
me
myself
but
i
do
admire
your
feet
so
matt
flushed
startled
gregson
william
gregson
and
made
a
speciality
of
feet
the
form
divine
is
beautiful
everywhere
sir
but
the
foot
ah
there
you
have
the
combination
of
graces
all
the
beautiful
curves
in
a
small
compass
the
arch
of
the
foot
the
ankle
instep
the
beautiful
proportions
of
it
all
when
you
do
get
a
really
beautiful
foot
such
as
yours
i
come
here
sir
every
night
to
study
the
beautiful
for
in
daily
life
the
foot
is
distorted
by
boots
and
shoes
that
ignore
the
subtleties
and
delicacies
of
nature
and
the
foot
is
the
first
thing
i
look
at
but
how
rarely
does
a
model
man
or
woman
a
truly
beautiful
foot
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
paint
your
foot
or
take
a
cast
of
it
a
study
from
the
nude
of
course
but
no
you
will
not
allow
me
i
know
may
i
at
least
be
allowed
to
measure
it
to
take
the
proportions
to
add
to
my
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
the
beautiful
foot
matt
faltered
that
he
know
he
had
anything
extraordinary
in
the
way
of
feet
dear
sir
protested
william
gregson
showing
the
whites
of
his
eyes
just
then
the
light
was
turned
up
and
william
gregson
retreated
abruptly
to
his
easel
the
court
scattered
and
she
herself
resumed
her
inglorious
occupation
of
the
throne
placing
her
feet
within
a
line
and
her
arm
against
a
mark
in
the
sheet
matt
returning
to
his
canvas
worked
enthusiastically
to
finish
the
figure
by
and
laid
down
his
brush
with
some
minutes
to
spare
thereby
drawing
upon
himself
the
attention
of
his
mentor
who
exclaimed
jove
what
made
you
rush
along
like
that
was
no
time
said
matt
why
four
more
evenings
every
model
sits
a
fortnight
six
nights
you
done
anyhow
said
matt
in
rueful
amusement
she
done
and
his
mentor
laughed
that
never
do
you
show
work
like
not
like
but
no
finish
in
it
only
a
sketch
supposed
to
make
a
careful
study
of
it
tarmigan
insists
on
the
exact
character
of
the
model
he
always
says
even
early
things
were
tight
and
but
matt
felt
he
could
not
take
the
thing
any
further
at
any
rate
not
that
night
the
fury
of
inspiration
was
over
he
sat
abstractedly
watching
the
quivering
of
the
tired
limbs
and
her
shadows
on
the
screen
a
dusky
silhouette
with
lighter
penumbras
till
the
hour
was
up
on
homeward
journey
he
was
overtaken
by
old
gregson
who
discovered
that
their
routes
coincided
and
renewed
his
admiration
of
foot
and
his
request
to
gauge
its
beauties
till
at
last
unwilling
to
disoblige
a
brother
artist
but
feeling
rather
ridiculous
the
young
man
slipped
off
his
boot
in
the
shelter
of
a
doorway
under
the
light
of
a
and
the
wrinkled
old
man
producing
a
ecstatically
recorded
on
a
crumpled
envelope
the
varied
perfections
of
its
form
at
the
next
lesson
matt
set
to
work
and
painted
away
all
the
force
of
his
study
in
the
effort
to
reach
the
standard
prevailing
at
but
he
worked
dispirited
and
joyless
like
a
between
the
shafts
of
an
omnibus
or
a
savage
in
a
stiff
shirt
and
a
suppressing
himself
with
the
same
sense
of
drear
duty
as
when
he
had
sawn
logs
or
drilled
potatoes
during
the
while
matt
was
listening
in
amazement
to
some
secret
information
concerning
royal
personages
who
seemed
to
have
confided
all
their
intrigues
to
bubbles
william
gregson
drew
him
mysteriously
into
the
anteroom
you
know
i
sleep
the
other
night
said
the
meagre
wrinkled
old
man
with
the
pathetic
stoop
you
ill
said
matt
sympathetically
your
foot
kept
me
matt
cast
a
furtive
look
at
it
as
if
to
read
marks
of
guilt
thereon
you
must
know
a
shoemaker
by
trade
and
love
art
but
i
devote
myself
to
it
like
you
young
fellows
i
work
all
day
and
only
in
the
evenings
that
i
can
spare
an
hour
for
eyes
moistened
sympathetically
so
sorry
he
murmured
knew
you
would
be
i
knew
you
had
a
beautiful
nature
it
always
goes
with
beautiful
feet
ah
you
smile
an
enthusiast
i
admit
and
you
will
smile
more
when
you
i
sat
up
half
the
last
two
nights
to
create
an
artistic
boot
with
your
beautiful
lines
you
had
given
me
the
inspiration
i
had
to
create
there
and
then
i
was
tired
of
my
work
i
was
poor
and
my
time
was
valuable
but
before
all
i
am
an
artist
sir
i
have
brought
the
boots
with
here
he
produced
a
parcel
from
under
his
arm
i
shall
be
proud
if
you
will
accept
them
as
a
tribute
from
a
lover
of
the
no
i
think
of
taking
them
said
matt
blushing
furiously
but
you
will
vex
me
sir
if
you
do
not
it
pains
me
enough
already
to
think
of
you
the
cumbrous
inartistic
pair
i
take
them
unless
i
pay
you
for
no
what
is
a
guinea
between
artists
and
he
pressed
the
parcel
into
hand
matt
shook
his
head
he
was
appalled
at
the
price
but
he
felt
it
be
fair
to
take
the
poor
old
work
for
nothing
a
vague
suspicion
that
he
was
being
tricked
flitted
beneath
his
troubled
mind
but
his
worldly
experiences
had
not
yet
robbed
him
of
his
guilelessness
and
there
was
such
a
fire
of
abnegation
in
the
homely
face
that
matt
felt
ashamed
of
his
doubt
and
drew
out
the
money
with
a
feeling
that
he
was
at
any
rate
helping
a
worthy
artistic
soul
is
the
price
of
them
he
said
the
artist
took
the
money
and
looked
at
it
guinea
would
give
me
nearly
another
lessons
he
said
wistfully
it
in
your
pocket
then
insisted
matt
his
last
doubt
dissolving
in
but
the
cobbler
shook
his
head
no
sir
you
rob
me
of
my
impulse
i
can
not
charge
you
full
price
take
back
the
shilling
concede
something
to
my
if
that
satisfy
you
said
matt
reaccepting
it
tell
the
chaps
besought
the
shoemaker
pathetically
understand
us
they
would
laugh
at
our
innocent
as
matt
shared
this
distrust
of
the
sympathy
of
the
studio
he
was
not
backward
with
assurances
of
secrecy
while
he
was
laboriously
bulking
his
with
the
parcel
at
the
end
of
the
four
lessons
when
painting
seemed
to
him
to
be
getting
almost
as
smooth
as
a
wax
figure
and
as
dead
tarmigan
came
a
stern
man
prematurely
gray
at
whose
approach
heart
was
in
his
mouth
the
famous
artist
moved
leisurely
but
inevitably
towards
him
shedding
criticism
by
grunts
and
phrases
and
gestures
expressing
the
ineffable
by
an
upward
snap
of
the
fingers
accompanied
by
a
sibilation
inquiring
sarcastically
whether
one
student
was
drawing
the
model
or
the
and
sneeringly
recommending
another
to
move
his
drawing
the
model
every
now
and
again
he
sat
down
at
an
easel
to
get
the
point
of
view
and
taking
up
his
brush
suggested
tone
and
color
or
if
it
was
a
easel
borrowed
his
charcoal
and
showed
him
how
to
put
the
head
on
the
shoulders
or
fit
on
an
extremity
when
at
length
matt
felt
the
great
breath
on
his
neck
a
cold
shiver
ran
down
his
spine
the
brush
clove
to
his
paralyzed
hand
a
new
man
said
the
visitor
all
the
blood
in
body
seemed
to
be
rushing
to
his
face
his
hand
began
to
tremble
the
visitor
did
not
pass
on
immediately
he
said
do
you
come
from
a
want
of
sharpness
in
the
america
breathed
matt
mean
from
what
school
been
to
school
since
i
was
a
been
to
an
art
school
queried
the
visitor
in
surprise
impossible
the
face
is
very
well
but
the
rest
is
not
taken
far
enough
a
little
too
clever
search
search
even
early
things
were
but
you
must
have
had
a
deal
of
have
painted
quite
a
little
admitted
matt
not
rightly
though
i
did
study
artistic
anatomy
out
of
a
book
painted
hundreds
of
portraits
and
signs
and
the
artist
was
examining
the
work
more
minutely
you
call
that
practice
he
said
a
little
triumphant
smile
flitting
across
his
wintry
face
of
portraits
why
that
means
hundreds
of
models
why
however
did
you
get
all
those
commissions
more
than
i
can
boast
of
try
and
keep
that
lower
in
tone
and
use
that
color
at
all
he
added
his
fingers
tattooing
kindly
on
shoulder
the
class
had
pricked
up
its
ears
for
the
artist
spoke
by
habit
in
a
loud
tone
so
that
all
might
benefit
by
his
criticism
of
the
individual
and
his
remarks
to
the
were
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
run
was
only
in
the
country
places
in
nova
scotia
said
matt
apologetically
people
know
anything
about
it
so
long
as
i
made
a
handsome
likeness
it
was
all
they
cared
for
and
then
of
course
they
were
never
never
said
the
celebrity
with
a
little
laugh
they
always
wore
their
best
clothes
said
matt
smiling
too
this
is
the
first
time
done
one
like
done
it
yet
said
tarmigan
moving
on
that
foot
yet
to
be
studied
search
finish
you
please
sir
said
matt
with
an
unconscious
reversion
to
the
idiom
of
finished
the
said
tarmigan
got
another
toe
to
paint
thought
i
had
to
copy
the
model
exactly
said
matt
meekly
sir
said
tarmigan
puzzled
i
only
see
four
toes
on
that
the
artist
was
startled
he
cast
a
rapid
glance
at
the
model
lord
the
right
he
murmured
for
the
model
was
indeed
minus
a
toe
say
you
men
he
said
are
your
eyes
given
the
model
an
extra
toe
how
often
have
i
told
you
to
look
before
you
paint
all
eyes
were
bent
on
the
foot
the
model
reddened
those
whose
work
had
not
yet
been
examined
hastened
to
amputate
the
toe
the
others
took
on
an
air
of
injury
might
have
told
a
chap
whispered
his
mentor
thought
you
knew
said
matt
saw
it
as
soon
as
i
began
to
paint
but
i
take
any
notice
of
it
in
my
first
rough
sketch
it
was
only
when
you
told
me
i
must
copy
the
model
exactly
that
i
put
it
in
or
rather
left
it
for
some
time
longer
the
fusillade
of
criticisms
rang
out
intermittently
i
make
too
much
of
those
little
things
keep
it
broader
very
well
better
get
your
shadows
too
hot
a
good
bit
too
long
from
the
knee
down
lick
it
much
bad
no
that
do
at
all
never
get
her
feet
into
that
canvas
at
the
model
with
your
eyes
nearly
closed
and
compare
the
tones
then
tarmigan
set
a
composition
to
be
done
at
home
in
illustration
of
and
stalked
through
the
door
amid
a
chorus
of
in
incongruous
keys
and
then
there
was
a
silence
so
tense
that
the
creak
of
his
departing
boots
could
be
heard
dying
away
in
the
long
passage
but
it
was
not
till
the
arrived
and
the
model
wrapping
a
cloak
round
her
had
left
the
room
and
grainger
had
silently
disappeared
after
his
wont
that
the
storm
burst
bubbles
led
off
ever
saw
a
picture
of
a
woman
with
four
toes
he
cried
disgustedly
how
could
he
expect
us
to
examine
her
blooming
toes
said
the
student
i
saw
she
had
four
toes
right
enough
said
bubbles
a
painter
got
to
paint
accidents
got
to
paint
be
an
accident
if
you
paint
pictures
put
in
the
wag
saw
the
missing

the
handsome
young
irishman
i
set
her
for
the
class
but
i
going
to
spoil
the
study
one
can
easily
imagine
a
toe

no
sense

a

on
her
wrist
volunteered
the
man
wonder
he
want
us
to
paint
suppose
put
a
background
to
it
and
send
it
to
the
academy
cackled
the
young
man
got
blue
noses
in
nova
scotia
i
believe
i
wonder
if
he
put
into
his
portraits
the
weedy
giant
remarked
in
a
loud
whisper
to
the
little
man
with
the
mane
though
the
last
two
remarks
were
so
impersonal
matt
knew
well
enough
they
were
aimed
at
him
and
he
seemed
to
feel
an
undercurrent
of
resentment
against
himself
beneath
the
animadversions
on
tarmigan
whom
he
knew
the
studio
revered
he
sat
uneasily
on
his
stool
poring
mechanically
over
his
unhappy
study
from
the
nude
and
morbidly
misreading
animosity
into
this
badinage
before
his
living
death
he
might
have
replied
violently
with
word
or
even
fist
but
life
had
broken
him
in
seeing
the
new
man
spiritless
another
student
took
up
the
parable
going
to
leave
it
to
the
have
to
leave
it
on
the
when
looking
replied
the
weedy
giant
then
the
stream
of
wit
ran
dry
and
comparative
silence
fell
upon
the
room
abruptly
the
voice
of
the
wag
shot
across
the
silence
the
cry
was
taken
up
in
a
great
shout
of
laughter
even
the
uninterested
joining
in
from
sheer
joy
in
a
catchword
it
seemed
to
matt
he
had
not
a
friend
in
the
room
but
he
mistook
the
grizzled
old
shoemaker
sidled
up
to
him
licked
me
sir
he
said
in
emotional
accents
shamed
me
me
whose
speciality
is
feet
i
never
noticed
there
was
a
toe
no
sir
not
even
me
your
hand
sir
i
bear
you
no
gratefully
matt
gripped
the
extended
hand
and
he
took
occasion
to
apologize
for
not
enduing
the
artistic
boots
explaining
that
he
was
reserving
them
for
high
days
and
holidays
he
let
the
bantering
cry
die
away
unanswered
but
at
heart
he
was
sick
with
the
thought
he
was
to
repeat
the
experience
of
the
john
and
he
had
a
fierce
impulse
to
shake
the
dust
of
the
studio
off
his
feet
even
as
he
had
thrown
up
his
position
in
new
brunswick
and
in
his
resentful
bitterness
he
allowed
his
sense
of
the
inferiority
of
the
work
to
well
up
into
clear
consciousness
and
thus
he
brought
himself
round
to
the
remembrance
of
the
great
words
and
to
a
softening
sense
of
gratitude
for
the
strange
way
in
which
he
had
been
acquiring
art
in
his
own
land
even
while
he
was
yearning
and
planning
to
get
it
across
the
seas
and
so
though
the
nickname
stuck
to
him
for
indeed
scarcely
knew
his
real
name
he
remained
at
the
studio
learning
to
take
its
humors
more
genially
and
even
to
partake
in
them
and
drawn
to
its
by
the
discovery
that
they
too
were
fighting
their
way
to
art
from
the
shop
the
school
or
the
office
but
never
losing
altogether
the
shyness
and
sensitiveness
of
a
lonely
alien
and
soul
from
tarmigan
whose
executive
faculty
and
technical
knowledge
were
remarkable
and
who
despite
surface
revolts
behind
his
back
was
worshipped
by
the
whole
school
matt
got
many
as
he
called
them
in
his
transatlantic
idiom
traditions
of
the
craft
which
he
might
never
have
hit
out
for
himself
though
on
the
other
hand
in
the
little
studies
he
made
at
home
and
sometimes
showed
to
tarmigan
he
produced
effects
instinctively
the
technique
of
which
he
was
puzzled
to
explain
to
the
who
for
the
rest
did
not
approve
of
the
strange
warm
luminosities
matt
professed
to
see
on
london
tiles
or
the
misty
coruscations
that
glorified
his
grainger
himself
never
offered
criticisms
to
his
pupils
except
casually
and
mainly
by
way
of
conversation
when
he
was
bored
with
his
own
thoughts
to
the
science
of
art
which
tarmigan
taught
and
which
was
based
upon
inductions
from
great
pictures
matt
in
his
turn
did
not
always
take
kindly
the
reduction
of
æsthetics
to
rule
chafed
him
he
was
distressed
by
symmetrical
formulæ
against
symmetry
and
though
some
of
the
canons
of
composition
seemed
to
him
when
once
pointed
out
and
others
not
unreasonable
he
could
not
always
relish
the
mechanical
application
of
the
general
law
to
his
particular
case
but
he
suppressed
his
untutored
instincts
much
as
in
her
day
his
mother
had
wrestled
with
satan
and
in
faith
hope
and
submitted
himself
duteously
to
law
and
tarmigan
he
worked
fluently
for
the
most
part
but
every
now
and
then
came
a
sudden
impotency
not
always
due
to
lack
of
sympathy
with
the
model
an
inability
to
get
the
exact
effect
he
wanted
which
tortured
him
even
more
than
of
dogma
very
soon
grew
half
boastful
half
jealous
of
its
american
prodigy
whom
all
later
arrivals
catching
up
the
nickname
without
the
history
of
its
origin
imagined
to
be
likewise
abnormal
in
the
number
of
his
toes
some
recalled
clubfoot
and
wondered
if
matt
pedal
defect
had
any
connection
with
the
genius
of
chapter
iii
the
elder
branch
in
the
heated
discussions
at
of
the
demerits
of
the
painters
of
the
day
no
one
ever
mentioned
the
name
of
strang
except
once
and
then
the
christian
name
was
not
matthew
matt
did
not
like
to
bring
up
the
name
himself
as
it
was
his
own
but
he
soon
understood
that
artists
do
not
deal
in
other
pictures
and
recalling
madame
remark
about
her
husband
he
gradually
came
to
the
conviction
that
his
namesake
was
the
dethroned
god
of
an
earlier
day
discouraged
into
sterility
and
commerce
by
the
indifference
of
the
younger
generation
and
as
the
deity
loomed
less
terrible
and
as
matt
felt
himself
more
at
home
in
the
art
atmosphere
of
england
so
the
idea
of
making
himself
known
to
his
uncle
began
to
be
shorn
of
its
terrors
and
even
to
be
tinged
with
the
generous
thought
of
inspiring
the
neglected
artist
to
fresh
work
an
inversion
of
attitude
the
humor
of
which
did
not
occur
to
him
but
when
one
afternoon
he
did
betake
himself
again
to
the
elegant
emporium
off
cavendish
square
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
dapper
young
gentleman
and
his
horseshoe
the
old
awe
of
the
refinement
radiating
from
every
quarter
of
the
compass
overwhelmed
him
and
his
tongue
refused
to
ask
for
strang
compromising
by
a
happy
thought
in
the
demand
for
madame
madame
appeared
forthwith
flashing
upon
him
a
sense
of
matronly
sweetness
and
silk
and
snatching
him
from
the
embarrassment
of
openings
by
exclaiming
in
her
charming
accent
come
for
your
change
asked
matt
left
sixpence
on
the
desk
i
noted
it
is
very
kind
of
you
said
matt
had
no
idea
you
would
remember
me
all
this
never
forget
clever
people
said
madame
with
a
bewitching
smile
do
you
know
clever
matt
smiled
back
madame
waved
away
the
question
with
her
plump
white
hand
in
silent
smiling
reaffirmation
always
lived
with
clever
people
she
said
simply
is
the
only
thing
i
admire
in
this
matt
said
lamely
that
he
was
glad
to
hear
it
the
phrase
was
a
poor
expression
of
his
pleasure
in
at
last
meeting
a
soul
with
his
own
ideals
was
it
you
saw
my
pictures
asked
madame
eagerly
matt
flushed
see
any
he
confessed
father
told
me
about
did
your
father
see
them
home
when
they
were
boys
they
were
said
matt
and
felt
the
instant
relief
of
criminal
confession
madame
uttered
a
little
cry
of
delighted
astonishment
and
took
hands
in
hers
dear
sir
my
dear
sir
she
cried
shaking
them
knew
you
were
clever
come
inside
come
inside
why
you
say
who
you
were
last
time
you
are
the
boy
who
wrote
to
matthew
from
nova
scotia
years
ago
what
a
pity
he
is
out
he
will
be
so
and
still
holding
his
hands
she
led
him
up
a
little
flight
of
stairs
into
a
daintily
furnished
resplendent
with
pictures
and
sat
him
down
in
a
soft
and
hung
admiringly
over
him
and
plied
him
with
inquiries
as
to
his
past
and
his
projects
and
things
nova
scotian
without
always
waiting
for
an
answer
or
ever
getting
more
than
a
brief
generality
and
rang
for
claret
and
cake
which
were
brought
in
by
a
pretty
girl
in
a
piquant
white
cap
but
which
matt
refused
for
fear
of
seeming
to
be
in
want
of
refreshment
have
a
son
who
is
also
an
artist
oh
so
clever
the
dear
boy
she
told
him
must
know
him
you
will
love
each
other
he
is
at
work
now
in
his
studio
but
he
must
not
be
interrupted
till
the
light
eyes
kindled
shall
like
to
know
him
he
cried
fervently
dear
herbert
oh
no
idea
how
sweet
and
good
and
clever
he
is
yet
as
obedient
as
a
child
so
proud
of
him
his
father
and
i
he
quite
consoles
us
for
the
failure
of
the
english
to
appreciate
where
can
i
see
work
asked
matt
eagerly
madame
shook
her
head
sadly
he
parted
with
all
his
pictures
ever
so
many
years
ago
she
said
they
exhibited
anywhere
know
they
must
be
some
day
if
they
are
not
destroyed
for
they
are
so
clever
but
the
fact
is
though
of
course
i
tell
it
to
a
stranger
we
had
to
to
pawn
them
and
they
were
never
redeemed
and
poor
matthew
never
would
paint
again
he
was
so
embittered
oh
it
was
such
a
slow
sad
struggle
those
early
days
of
our
married
life
for
years
no
one
would
buy
poor
work
and
when
the
money
he
had
brought
from
nova
scotia
gave
out
we
should
have
starved
if
i
had
not
started
a
little
shop
they
still
call
me
madame
she
interpolated
with
a
melancholy
smile
you
french
you
said
matt
thrilling
with
the
pathos
of
those
struggles
my
parents
were
french
but
i
have
spoken
english
almost
from
is
french
blood
in
our
family
too
murmured
matt
with
a
sad
recollection
of
his
mother
he
wondered
what
she
was
doing
at
the
moment
perhaps
that
was
what
drew
me
to
matthew
that
and
his
artistic
genius
poor
matthew
you
are
well
off
now
said
matt
dubiously
he
did
not
trouble
to
correct
her
mistake
to
explain
that
the
french
blood
was
on
the
spindle
side
we
are
rich
we
have
all
we
want
when
my
business
grew
prosperous
in
fact
quite
a
fashionable
resort
matthew
who
could
not
bear
to
be
out
of
touch
with
art
though
he
had
sworn
never
to
paint
again
saw
his
way
to
dealing
in
pictures
of
course
he
makes
far
more
than
any
of
his
artist
friends
who
succeeded
but
that
does
not
console
me
for
the
pictures
the
world
has
why
he
paint
now
that
he
has
money
inquired
matt
says
too
old
said
madame
sighing
besides
he
thinks
only
be
eclipsed
by
herbert
of
course
herbert
exceptionally
gifted
he
took
the
medal
at
the
royal
academy
schools
you
know
for
the
best
copy
of
an
old
master
and
he
has
had
advantages
which
were
denied
to
his
poor
father
but
still
it
often
makes
me
cry
to
think
of
how
he
sinks
himself
in
the
dear
boy
not
caring
a
jot
about
his
own
reputation
oh
there
are
few
such
fathers
i
can
tell
you
i
know
what
i
have
done
to
deserve
such
a
husband
i
who
have
no
cleverness
or
talent
of
any
and
here
as
at
his
cue
matthew
strang
entered
in
a
soft
hat
and
a
black
cloak
vastly
more
impressive
than
the
staid
shabbiness
of
tarmigan
than
whom
his
vandyke
beard
alone
gave
him
the
greater
artistic
distinction
he
leaned
slightly
upon
a
gnarled
madame
sprang
up
to
meet
him
in
the
doorway
matthew
she
cried
ecstatically
young
man
who
wanted
to
see
you
is
your
own
nephew
and
he
is
come
to
study
art
and
it
be
delightful
for
herbert
to
have
a
companion
i
made
him
wait
for
you
i
knew
you
be
and
radiant
beneath
her
cap
madame
stepped
aside
as
if
to
leave
the
stage
free
for
the
rapturous
embrace
between
the
uncle
and
his
nephew
but
matthew
strang
stood
rigid
with
astonishment
only
his
eyes
moving
in
startled
examination
of
the
young
man
who
had
risen
respectfully
for
an
interval
of
seconds
that
seemed
numerable
in
minutes
he
looked
at
matt
without
speaking
leaning
on
his
stick
his
saturnine
face
growing
momently
darker
son
i
suppose
he
said
slowly
at
last
sir
said
matt
i
might
have
seen
it
so
you
have
come
to
england
after
all
sir
but
not
till
i
had
the
money
for
my
matthew
face
lightened
a
little
down
sit
down
no
need
to
stand
he
said
with
uneasy
graciousness
placing
his
disengaged
hand
on
shoulder
how
are
all
your
folks
pretty
spry
thank
you
said
matt
resuming
his
chair
me
see
your
mother
married
again
she
matt
nodded
still
alive
i
suppose
faltered
matt
the
province
about
the
same
said
matt
vaguely
said
strang
with
an
air
he
allowed
madame
to
divest
him
lovingly
of
his
cloak
then
he
said
settled
in
london
then
shall
stay
here
some
not
like
your
father
he
could
never
stay
in
one
place
well
well
sure
i
wish
you
success
but
you
know
not
an
easy
line
gone
you
wrote
to
me
well
i
wrote
the
was
much
obliged
to
you
sir
for
your
advice
said
matt
sincerely
but
the
elder
man
suspecting
sarcasm
replied
half
defiantly
not
one
man
in
a
thousand
that
makes
his
by
it
why
just
bought
a
picture
from
an
for
fifty
pounds
worth
treble
you
would
have
done
better
at
your
farm
or
was
it
a
the
money
i
was
thinking
of
sir
the
joy
of
i
talked
like
that
matthew
strang
sat
down
rather
peevishly
and
crossed
his
legs
you
talk
like
that
now
too
said
madame
with
gentle
reproach
for
yourself
she
corrected
hastily
as
his
eyebrows
took
their
interrogative
altitude
you
know
you
care
if
herbert
make
money
for
years
so
long
as
he
makes
a
reputation
is
in
a
different
position
he
need
to
earn
does
your
nephew
said
madame
has
ample
resources
he
tells
matt
blushed
at
unconscious
magnification
of
his
curt
statement
on
the
point
but
he
did
not
think
it
worth
while
contradicting
her
matthew
uncrossed
his
legs
restlessly
suppose
your
mother
married
a
man
pretty
matt
stammered
you
say
who
you
were
at
first
like
to
i
i
remembered
you
had
advised
me
not
to
come
to
the
mischief
was
done
you
might
just
as
well
have
spoken
i
might
have
given
you
some
advice
you
could
have
had
the
engraving
at
trade
price
if
you
are
looking
for
etchings
or
any
little
things
for
your
rooms
i
dream
of
treating
you
like
a
you
said
matt
with
feeble
fervency
mention
it
said
his
uncle
holding
up
his
right
palm
deprecatingly
what
made
you
address
your
letter
to
the
national
gallery
matt
colored
thought
all
the
london
painters
lived
there
he
said
with
an
uneasy
smile
madame
laughed
heartily
matthew
only
got
it
through
an
official
inquiring
among
the
people
copying
pictures
there
one
of
them
happened
to
be
a
customer
of
ours
and
suggested
trying
it
was
all
boyish
foolishness
said
matt
where
are
you
living
now
that
you
have
come
said
his
uncle
far
from
here
in
he
added
hastily
for
fear
his
uncle
might
be
meditating
a
visit
can
bring
you
some
of
my
work
if
you
yes
do
that
be
charming
interjected
madame
clapping
her
hands
matthew
checked
her
with
a
stern
glance
think
i
should
be
able
to
do
anything
with
an
unknown
man
he
said
shaking
his
head
i
mean
that
said
matt
getting
hot
thought
you
might
like
to
see
that
i
quite
a
duffer
i
expect
to
sell
my
work
yet
but
they
think
rather
promising
at
the
school
who
thinks
echoed
matthew
strang
i
could
have
picked
up
one
of
his
for
a
fiver
last
week
tarmigan
has
been
going
down
steadily
for
the
last
four
years
he
took
the
gold
medal
at
the
academy
and
at
first
promised
well
ten
years
ago
i
even
meditated
a
corner
in
him
but
luckily
i
had
the
sense
to
sell
out
in
time
before
it
was
quite
certain
he
would
never
even
be
an
associate
no
wonder
reduced
to
but
he
does
that
for
nothing
they
say
protested
matt
hotly
a
jolly
fine
chap
no
wonder
he
get
on
who
ever
heard
of
a
really
good
man
wasting
his
time
in
that
way
you
think
doing
any
good
studying
under
him
asked
matt
in
affright
all
right
for
teaching
i
a
word
against
him
one
of
the
few
men
in
england
who
are
supposed
to
know
their
trade
but
too
stilted
and
classical
no
sentiment
in
him
he
touch
the
heart
of
the
buying
public
all
science
and
draughtsmanship
and
he
do
anything
to
meet
the
market
half
spunky
of
him
to
stick
to
his
convictions
anyhow
said
matt
in
low
tones
provoked
by
his
disparagement
into
a
recrudescent
enthusiasm
for
tarmigan
who
had
recently
been
weighing
upon
him
like
a
nightmare
and
how
does
he
know
his
convictions
are
right
the
the
best
judge
of
said
matt
deprecatingly
you
really
think
so
course
i
think
so
would
the
public
have
no
and
the
public
was
he
looked
at
matt
half
fiercely
as
if
defying
him
to
deny
it
madame
was
smiling
and
shaking
her
head
always
right
he
went
on
emphatically
the
critics
that
throw
the
market
into
perpetual
confusion
such
a
babel
of
voices
all
laying
down
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
what
is
art
and
what
is
not
art
that
enough
to
drive
a
dealer
crazy
for
my
part
i
steer
by
the
academy
my
polestar
and
rarely
out
for
what
the
public
take
their
reckoning
by
and
an
that
my
boy
is
going
to
be
please
god
for
theories
may
come
and
theories
may
go
but
the
academy
goes
on
herbert
murmured
madame
suppose
awfully
advanced
said
matt
wistfully
ago
he
took
the
medal
for
the
best
copy
of
an
old
master
at
the
royal
academy
schools
where
he
is
now
just
finishing
his
course
explained
his
uncle
you
know
you
even
begin
the
course
without
being
i
know
said
matt
with
a
sinking
of
heart
for
he
had
by
this
time
studied
the
prospectus
of
the
national
and
been
dismayed
not
so
much
by
the
anatomical
information
and
technical
expertness
demanded
at
the
entrance
competition
as
by
the
septennial
course
the
drudgery
of
and
perspective
and
the
antique
and
all
the
tedious
grind
of
convention
thought
of
trying
to
get
in
myself
but
afraid
i
shall
have
to
give
up
the
herbert
only
drops
in
there
now
and
then
said
matthew
loftily
works
mostly
at
home
with
his
own
matt
had
a
pang
of
envy
then
he
has
always
had
the
benefit
of
your
experience
he
said
i
pretend
to
have
done
more
than
encourage
matthew
said
madame
shaking
her
finger
fondly
know
it
was
at
your
knee
that
he
made
his
first
matthew
smiled
faintly
not
displeased
like
tarmigan
i
can
teach
better
than
i
can
paint
he
said
and
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
wine
fascinating
eye
by
the
play
of
light
in
the
diamond
on
his
forefinger
i
listened
to
my
wife
i
should
give
up
business
and
set
up
an
easel
again
as
in
my
young
and
foolish
days
thank
god
he
said
pausing
to
gulp
down
the
claret
had
sense
to
stop
in
time
what
could
be
expected
of
a
young
man
lived
on
a
farm
in
a
country
ah
your
father
was
right
he
never
would
allow
any
merit
to
my
ships
or
red
sands
flitted
before
vision
with
lambent
pools
and
overhead
a
diaphanous
rosy
vapor
beyond
which
brooded
the
vast
cloudless
circle
of
the
sky
ah
god
why
was
the
sky
so
blue
and
depthless
in
those
days
as
from
dim
caverns
the
acrid
voice
of
the
reached
his
ears
in
complacent
exposition
all
training
and
if
you
get
trained
young
you
might
as
well
attempt
to
becoming
conscious
of
a
silence
matt
answered
the
same
with
music
went
on
his
uncle
tapping
impressively
on
his
wineglass
with
his
glittering
forefinger
expect
a
man
to
sit
down
and
practise
scales
like
a
little
girl
in
a
pinafore
and
even
if
he
would
his
fingers
have
lost
their
suppleness
his
joints
are
set
i
saw
this
clearly
and
was
determined
my
boy
suffer
as
done
why
herbert
had
a
brush
put
into
his
hand
before
he
could
write
heart
sank
lower
should
like
to
see
his
work
he
said
anxiously
said
matthew
a
complacent
smile
hovering
about
his
lips
yes
let
him
see
work
pleaded
madame
think
we
ought
to
disturb
him
said
matthew
yieldingly
you
take
another
glass
of
wine
thank
you
sir
said
matt
who
was
quite
faint
for
his
dinner
had
been
of
the
slightest
and
feeling
the
request
a
signal
to
take
his
leave
he
rose
yes
do
let
him
see
them
said
madame
hurriedly
only
for
well
as
a
sort
of
relation
said
the
father
imposingly
i
make
it
a
point
not
to
interrupt
him
these
hours
are
precious
not
too
much
light
at
the
best
of
and
as
if
following
impulse
he
rose
and
turned
doorward
no
need
for
you
to
trouble
josephine
he
said
waving
her
back
as
they
mounted
the
staircase
on
which
undraped
marble
statues
looked
down
from
their
niches
he
explained
gravely
a
male
model
up
there
you
matt
nodded
awed
to
silence
by
the
splendor
of
the
staircase
up
which
he
toiled
side
by
side
with
the
vandyke
beard
and
the
velvet
coat
of
course
uses
the
side
door
vouchsafed
his
companion
graciously
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
the
long
ascent
have
his
models
coming
through
the
matt
murmured
something
negative
but
his
reply
was
lost
in
a
dull
thud
from
above
the
elder
man
cleared
the
remaining
stairs
in
alarm
and
threw
open
the
door
us
a
hand
up
you
beggar
a
piping
girlish
voice
was
saying
on
the
rich
carpet
of
the
vast
elegant
studio
whose
glories
dazzled
vision
a
slim
young
man
was
sprawling
on
his
back
over
him
stood
a
stalwart
figure
clad
only
in
the
saturnine
rushed
forward
and
helped
his
boy
up
all
right
dad
said
herbert
in
unembarrassed
amusement
as
he
was
scrambling
to
his
feet
just
wanted
to
give
the
arms
a
little
movement
during
the
rest
the
so
difficult
for
him
i
been
able
to
get
the
thing
right
all
day
look
nothing
at
all
on
the
canvas
had
to
paint
it
the
model
had
somewhat
shamefacedly
taken
off
his
gloves
and
struck
an
attitude
upon
the
throne
said
matthew
strang
in
vague
accents
ought
to
be
getting
on
faster
with
those
studies
now
that
you
have
put
aside
your
picture
for
this
academy
you
will
need
all
your
time
you
know
brought
you
a
herbert
turned
his
face
towards
the
door
the
handsome
glowing
face
of
a
boy
beardless
and
with
candid
blue
eyes
and
tumbled
flaxen
hair
and
the
flash
of
white
teeth
accustomed
to
display
themselves
in
laughter
there
was
his
interrogative
mark
about
the
arched
eyebrows
as
he
caught
sight
of
matt
hanging
back
timidly
on
the
threshold
the
young
heart
was
leaden
his
soul
wrapped
in
a
gloom
which
had
been
gathering
blackness
ever
since
he
had
set
foot
in
his
shop
and
which
the
sight
of
the
commodious
studio
with
its
rich
properties
and
luxurious
appliances
its
crimson
lounges
and
silk
drapings
and
fleecy
rugs
and
gleaming
marbles
and
bronzes
had
darkened
into
despair
the
penurious
past
surged
back
to
him
through
a
suffusion
of
unshed
tears
tears
that
were
salt
with
the
sense
of
injustice
and
of
sorrows
unforgettable
all
the
creeping
irremediable
years
contributing
their
quintessence
to
the
bitterness
of
this
supreme
moment
the
chances
he
had
missed
the
lessons
he
had
not
received
the
obstacles
that
had
rather
sprung
up
to
beat
him
back
whose
infant
fingers
no
loving
hand
had
ever
guided
whose
boyish
yearnings
no
word
of
encouragement
had
ever
sweetened
whose
youth
had
been
all
distasteful
labors
and
mean
tragedies
and
burdens
too
great
to
bear
and
whose
very
triumph
would
find
none
to
sympathize
with
it
if
it
came
as
it
never
could
come
to
one
so
untrained
so
alien
from
the
world
of
art
and
elegant
studios
and
all
the
soft
things
of
life
driven
to
the
scum
of
the
streets
for
models
at
a
few
pence
an
hour
and
reduced
to
studying
attitudes
from
his
own
contortions
before
a
bleared
strip
of
mirror
in
a
dingy
back
room
unregarded
unknown
an
atom
in
that
vast
london
which
had
so
cruelly
disillusioned
him
and
in
which
even
the
one
heart
in
which
his
own
blood
ran
was
cold
and
far
away
his
poor
at
his
primacy
among
a
set
of
duffers
no
augury
of
success
in
that
fierce
struggle
in
which
tarmigan
himself
had
gone
to
the
wall
was
it
worth
while
to
vex
himself
endlessly
swirled
to
and
fro
like
a
bubble
on
an
ocean
were
it
not
sweeter
to
break
and
to
be
resolved
into
the
vastness
and
the
silence
his
right
hand
wandered
towards
his
where
his
pistol
lay
how
good
to
be
done
with
life
then
he
became
aware
through
a
mist
that
the
gracious
blond
boy
was
holding
out
his
hand
with
a
frank
smile
and
instinct
drew
out
his
own
right
hand
in
amicable
response
and
so
the
temptation
was
over
the
poor
children
dependent
upon
him
came
up
to
memory
and
he
wondered
at
his
spasm
of
selfish
despair
his
uncle
must
have
said
words
to
which
he
had
been
deaf
for
herbert
seemed
to
know
who
he
was
and
why
he
had
come
fair
coz
he
said
gripping
hand
heartily
feel
as
if
i
were
in
shakespeare
a
moment
ago
i
scarcely
remembered
i
had
a
relation
in
the
world
confound
it
why
you
a
girl
cousin
while
you
were
about
it
be
rude
said
his
father
herbert
elevated
his
blond
eyebrows
wish
you
would
cultivate
a
sense
of
humor
dad
he
observed
wearily
matt
who
was
responding
to
his
grip
fascinated
instantly
by
the
boyish
sunny
charm
loosed
his
clasp
in
sheer
astonishment
at
the
transition
matthew
strang
disregarded
his
observation
but
gruffly
told
the
model
whose
attitudinizing
immobility
was
irritating
that
he
need
not
pose
for
a
moment
or
two
whereupon
herbert
bade
him
begone
altogether
been
off
color
all
day
he
observed
explanatorily
as
he
counted
out
the
silver
the
excitement
of
discovering
i
am
not
alone
in
the
world
is
the
finishing
matthew
threw
a
rather
reproachful
look
at
matt
whose
eyes
drooped
guiltily
he
raised
them
immediately
however
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
to
admire
a
study
of
a
draped
figure
which
was
hung
on
a
wall
the
coloring
struck
him
agreeably
though
he
found
a
certain
feebleness
in
the
drawing
which
was
equally
agreeable
to
his
jealous
mood
this
not
displeasing
impression
was
borne
out
by
the
other
pictures
and
sketches
for
which
his
uncle
besought
his
admiration
always
this
facile
poetic
coloring
and
this
indifferent
draughtsmanship
this
suggestion
of
difficulties
shirked
rather
than
of
difficulties
overcome
at
last
seen
to
be
due
to
the
conventional
composition
most
of
the
works
whether
in
chalk
or
or
oil
being
pretty
landscapes
or
studies
in
simple
attitudes
or
when
complicated
by
other
figures
embracing
episodes
which
seemed
to
have
been
transferred
direct
from
other
pictures
some
of
which
indeed
matt
had
seen
either
in
the
originals
or
in
engravings
to
his
astonishment
herbert
who
had
been
yawning
widely
drew
his
attention
to
one
such
little
bit
you
recognize
that
he
said
did
at
once
a
quotation
from
matt
looked
puzzled
at
the
phrase
the
unwise
it
call
expounded
herbert
so
did
dad
till
i
explained
to
him
it
was
only
quoting
when
a
great
writer
hits
off
a
phrase
it
passes
into
the
language
and
when
a
great
painter
hits
off
a
new
effect
of
technique
or
gets
a
happy
grouping
i
contend
it
belongs
to
the
craft
as
much
as
the
primitive
tricks
of
scumbling
or
glazing
we
praise
the
mellow
virgilisms
in
tennyson
but
we
are
down
upon
the
painter
who
repeats
lines
the
old
masters
borrowed
unblushingly
but
we
are
such
sticklers
for
originality
which
after
all
only
means
plagiarizing
nature

hastened
to
exhibit
his
other
curios
coins

ivories
with
a
cursive
autobiographical
commentary
passing
rapidly
to
another
object
whenever
his
father
threatened
to
take
up
the
thread
of
autobiography
and
as
matt
handled
these
picturesque
trophies
of
travel
that
wafted
into
the
studio
the
aroma
of
foreign
bazaars
the
wave
of
hopelessness
resurged
swamping
even
the
fresh
hopefulness
engendered
by
the
discovery
that
his
craftsmanship
was
not
so
far
beyond
his
hand

all
all

marvellous
places
that
had

themselves
from

lonely

mirages
thrown
upon
a
phantasmal
sky
not
vaguely
but
with
the

definiteness
of
a
vision
jostling

another

of

steeped
in

and

where
the
long
desolation
of

never
came

the

splendid

a
white

from

in
a
flood
of
sadness
that
had
yet
something
delicious
in
it

pitied
himself
for

off
from

enjoyed

said
herbert
pausing
amid

to

was
soothed
it
thrilled
him
to
be
called

gentleman

said
his
uncle
holding
out
his
hand
for
the
first

dare
say
i
shall
see
you
again
ha
drop
in
any

passing
i
think

presently
he
moved
to
the
door
then
paused
and
turning
his
head
uneasily
said
if
you
ever
want
any
advice
you
know
hesitate
to
ask
and
with
a
faint
friendly
nod
of
his
vandyke
beard
he
went
out
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
bore
the
governor
said
herbert
stretching
his
arms
never
knows
when
matt
did
not
know
what
was
except
when
he
saw
it
printed
but
the
disrespectful
tone
jarred
upon
him
owe
him
a
good
deal
it
seems
to
me
he
replied
simply
hullo
my
young
methodist
parson
and
herbert
threw
back
his
head
in
a
ringing
laugh
which
made
his
white
teeth
gleam
gayly
do
you
think
we
owe
anything
to
our
parents
they
marry
to
oblige
us
i
am
only
a
tool
for
his
do
you
mean
murmured
matt
well
i
to
talk
about
it
perhaps
but
my
first
cousin
the
first
cousin
ever
matt
smiled
fascinated
afresh
after
all
an
open
secret
that
he
wants
the
name
of
strang
to
live
in
the
annals
of
painting
if
it
be
matthew
strang
it
must
be
herbert
strang
and
so
he
belongs
to
the
minor
clubs
of
course
he
get
into
the
though
he
contrives
to
be
there
on
business
pretty
often
and
consoles
himself
by
using
their
but
at
the
gillray
and
the
they
dare
not
blackball
him
because
the
committee
always
owe
him
money
or
want
to
sell
him
pictures
but
i
dare
say
they
laugh
at
him
behind
his
back
when
he
jaws
to
them
about
art
in
general
and
my
talents
in
particular
confoundedly
annoying
oh
been
forgetting
to
smoke
what
can
be
the
matter
with
me
and
he
pulled
out
a
case
from
which
matt
not
liking
to
refuse
drew
forth
a
cigarette
what
good
does
he
do
by
belonging
to
those
clubs
he
asked
he
likes
it
for
one
thing
replied
herbert
striking
a
match
and
holding
it
to
cigarette
belief
is
he
only
went
into
the
picture
business
to
rub
shoulders
with
artists
though
where
the
charm
comes
in
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
out
for
a
duller
a
more
illiterate
set
of
fellows
i
never
wish
to
meet
shop
is
all
they
can
talk
and
then
of
course
good
for
business
but
in
the
background
lurks
i
feel
sure
the
idea
of
advancing
my
interests
of
accumulating
influence
of
pulling
the
ropes
that
shall
at
last
lift
me
into
the
proud
position
of
nay
who
knows
he
said
puffing
out
his
first
wreath
of
smoke
of
the
royal
academy
and
he
laughed
melodiously
but
began
matt
inhaling
the
delicious
scent
of
the
tobacco
echoed
herbert
just
it
my
tastes
are
not
considered
in
the
matter
at
all
art
art
art
nothing
but
art
rammed
down
my
throat
till
sick
of
the
sight
of
a
canvas
i
was
a
connoisseur
in
my
cradle
and
sucked
a
instead
of
a
and
i
live
in
the
midst
of
art
and
out
of
the
profits
of
it
pictures
pictures
everywhere
and
not
a
oh
have
a
you
stand
about
as
if
you
were
matt
obediently
dropped
upon
a
lounge
that
yielded
deliciously
to
his
pressure
the
fragrant
smoke
curled
about
his
face
while
his
cousin
made
pleasant
play
with
popping
corks
and
gurgling
liquids
you
really
like
painting
he
asked
in
astonishment
like
some
things
in
it
well
enough
replied
herbert
such
beastly
drudgery
all
this
wretched
copying
of
models
is
no
better
than
photography
and
a
camera
would
do
the
tiding
in
a
thousandth
part
of
the
time
i
always
work
from
photographs
when
i
is
that
artistic
said
matt
slightly
shocked
the
only
thing
worthy
of
the
dignity
the
bulk
of
art
is
work
besides
lots
of
do
it
nowadays
with
to
boot
because
one
man
by
a
fluke
happens
to
be
a
better
than
another
is
he
to
be
counted
the
greater
artist
matt
felt
small
before
this
answer
to
his
secret
criticism
you
ever
see
the
at
the
crystal
palace
that
does
landscapes
in
a
jiffy
that
we
should
go
messing
over
for
months
and
then
think
of
the
they
talk
of
rembrandt
and
franz
hals
back
a
bedroom
mirror
to
put
more
life
into
its
portraits
than
either
of
why
if
some
process
were
invented
a
sort
of
magic
mirror
to
fix
the
image
living
and
colored
in
the
glass
luck
he
clinked
his
glass
against
governor
would
have
to
shut
up
but
the
mirror
got
any
imagination
urged
matt
setting
down
his
glass
refreshed
the
glow
of
brandy
in
his
throat
lending
added
intellectual
charm
to
the
discussion
i
know
there
are
distorting
mirrors
rejoined
herbert
laughing
you
are
quite
right
art
is
selection
nature
travers
art
is
autobiography
but
painting
which
somehow
monopolizes
the
name
of
art
is
really
the
lowest
form
of
art
nature
is
full
of
scenes
quite
as
good
as
art
ruskin
say
an
artist
has
got
to
copy
nature
but
is
there
anything
in
nature
so
closely
akin
to
a
poem
or
to
own
prose
or
to
a
symphony
of
beethoven
as
a
moonlit
sea
or
a
beautiful
woman
is
to
a
picture
what
is
the
song
compared
to
or
the
music
of
the
sea
to
the
real
creation
is
in
the
other
arts
which
are
called
literature
and
music
they
are
an
addition
to
nature
something
extra
painting
and
acting
these
are
mere
reduplications
of
nature
perhaps
i
was
unfair
to
painting
that
at
least
fixes
the
beauty
of
nature
but
acting
is
merely
an
evanescent
imitation
of
the
the
younger
man
sat
half
bewildered
beneath
this
torrent
of
words
and
quotations
the
respect
herbert
had
lost
in
his
eyes
by
his
draughtsmanship
a
trifling
matter
under
disdainful
analysis
returning
multiplied
to
reverence
and
with
a
fresh
undercurrent
of
humility
and
envy
how
much
there
was
to
know
in
the
world
how
many
languages
and
books
and
arts
how
could
he
mix
with
herbert
and
his
set
without
being
found
out
why
i
prefer
literature
and
music
said
herbert
then
not
my
own
master
like
you
you
lucky
beggar
if
i
had
my
way
pictures
would
be
nothing
but
sheer
imagination
with
no
relation
to
truth
of
nature
what
do
i
care
how
her
shadows
fall
if
they
fall
gracefully
and
then
why
must
my
lines
imitate
where
the
japanese
are
so
great
smoke
that
have
another
and
he
threw
his
across
to
his
magnetized
listener
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
hard
busy
existence
matt
had
ever
heard
any
one
talk
like
a
book
discussing
abstract
relations
of
art
and
life
wish
i
knew
as
much
as
you
he
said
naïvely
wish
i
was
as
free
as
you
retorted
herbert
laughingly
i
certainly
employ
my
liberty
as
you
do
what
in
name
made
you
want
to
study
art
i
did
laugh
when
the
governor
told
the
mater
of
your
letter
i
was
just
in
the
roughest
grind
and
felt
like
writing
you
on
the
sly
to
warn
think
i
should
have
taken
your
advice
said
matt
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
what
made
you
come
to
london
anyhow
why
you
go
to
paris
paris
no
teaching
to
be
got
in
matt
turned
pale
at
least
what
everybody
says
in
england
paris
alone
has
the
tradition
once
it
was
holland
once
florence
and
now
paris
why
in
paris
any
fellows
who
club
together
can
get
the
biggest
men
to
visit
them
free
gratis
for
nothing
here
the
big
pots
prefer
the
society
of
the
why
are
you
not
in
paris
asked
matt
rallying
where
my
governor
is
such
an
idiot
he
pretends
to
think
more
chance
for
a
man
been
through
the
academy
schools
he
gets
known
to
the
and
all
that
but
his
real
reason
is
that
afraid
to
trust
me
in
paris
by
said
matt
in
sympathetic
incredulity
why
he
had
this
room
knocked
into
a
studio
for
me
it
always
reminds
me
of
a
nursery
at
the
top
of
the
even
selects
my
female
models
knows
their
parents
and
that
sort
of
thing
all
sheer
selfishness
i
tell
you
and
just
sick
of
all
this
perpetual
fussing
and
worrying
over
me
as
if
i
were
a
prize
pig
or
a
a
man
of
not
allowed
to
have
a
studio
or
chambers
of
his
own
you
realize
how
lucky
you
are
my
boy
if
i
could
afford
it
chuck
up
the
governor
but
dependent
on
him
for
every
farthing
and
all
he
allows
me
for
is
well
never
guess
matt
did
not
make
the
attempt
he
judged
herbert
might
think
meanly
of
even
a
pound
a
week
but
he
did
not
dare
to
hazard
a
guess
hundred
a
year
and
out
of
that
got
to
get
my
clothes
and
pay
my
models
confound
matt
stared
in
startled
reverential
envy
you
may
well
stare
why
you
know
yourself
if
you
buy
a
woman
a
bracelet
it
runs
away
with
a
allowance
but
talking
of
clothes
have
to
get
better
than
those
things
if
you
ever
want
me
to
be
seen
with
are
quite
new
murmured
matt
in
alarm
original
added
herbert
have
to
introduce
you
to
my
is
he
dear
matt
stammered
you
pay
him
said
herbert
dryly
i
always
pay
protested
matt
lucky
have
to
matt
thought
suddenly
of
william
gregson
with
a
throb
of
gratitude
at
least
his
wardrobe
boasted
of
unimpeachable
boots
then
he
suddenly
espied
a
small
battalion
of
ranged
against
a
wall
black
boots
brown
boots
patent
shoes
brown
shoes
boots
with
laces
boots
with
beautiful
buttons
and
he
relapsed
into
his
primitive
humility
uneasy
lest
herbert
should
insist
on
equipping
him
similarly
he
was
glad
to
remember
that
mother
was
expecting
her
boy
and
with
a
murmur
to
that
effect
rose
to
go
said
herbert
not
due
till
but
if
you
must
be
going
i
think
just
stroll
a
little
you
go
towards
oxford
street
you
faltered
matt
who
was
a
little
frightened
at
the
idea
that
his
dainty
cousin
might
accompany
him
to
his
lodging
right
just
go
to
the
club
to
see
if
there
are
any
letters
another
of
your
privileges
confound
you
i
have
any
letters
come
to
my
own
not
not
do
you
think
have
the
governor
nosing
my
correspondence
be
always
asking
questions
a
jolly
little
club
put
you
up
for
it
if
you
like
take
another
cigarette
take
half
a
dozen
put
in
your
as
they
were
going
matt
said
he
would
like
to
say
to
madame
so
they
passed
into
the
my
dear
nephew
said
madame
shaking
both
his
hands
said
you
and
herbert
would
love
each
other
you
will
find
your
sixpence
awaiting
you
on
the
chapter
iv
the
never
been
to
see
your
place
i
must
look
you
up
one
thus
herbert
at
uncertain
intervals
but
he
never
carried
out
his
threat
his
life
was
too
full
and
he
had
been
accustomed
from
childhood
to
have
the
mountain
come
to
mohammed
and
so
gradually
matt
who
had
at
first
lived
half
apprehensive
of
an
exposure
half
wishful
that
herbert
should
become
rudely
aware
of
his
real
position
surrendered
himself
to
the
magnetism
of
his
manner
and
weakly
tried
to
live
up
to
that
young
misconception
of
him
whenever
they
were
together
even
submitting
to
a
morning
suit
and
an
evening
dress
from
tailor
for
an
undefined
sum
at
an
unmentioned
date
for
if
the
disadvantages
of
society
were
many
if
he
had
to
starve
for
days
to
return
club
hospitality
at
a
restaurant
still
he
was
satisfied
the
game
was
worth
the
candle
from
herbert
he
felt
himself
acquiring
polish
and
refinement
and
impeccable
english
and
social
lore
herbert
was
an
intellectual
stimulus
with
thoughts
to
give
away
and
the
newest
poets
to
lend
herbert
was
bright
and
gay
charming
away
the
vapors
of
youthful
despondency
but
above
all
herbert
sometimes
allowed
him
to
work
in
his
studio
amid
the
sensuous
beauty
of
draping
and
decoration
and
statuary
that
lapped
his
artistic
nature
like
a
soft
summer
sea
a
privilege
inestimable
but
in
view
of
the
mere
model
worth
at
least
all
the
extra
money
this
friendship
cost
him
it
befell
thus
on
second
visit
herbert
said
just
laid
my
palette
you
sit
down
see
what
you
can
i
cried
matt
eagerly
there
was
a
on
the
throne
a
beauty
in
oriental
drapery
herbert
relinquished
the
brush
and
threw
himself
upon
his
back
on
the
couch
puffing
lazily
at
his
cigarette
jove
he
said
after
ten
minutes
put
that
in
all
right
but
what
a
juicy
style
got
where
did
you
get
that
from
do
it
any
other
way
said
matt
apologetically
governor
told
me
under
tarmigan
he
never
taught
you
that
but
the
way
always
worked
i
did
a
lot
of
portraits
in
nova
devil
you
did
no
wonder
made
money
confound
you
i
thought
you
were
a
blooming
ignoramus
just
come
over
to
learn
your
pictorial
pothooks
and
thought
so
too
said
matt
flushing
with
pleasure
and
modesty
of
your
sarcasm
you
beggar
you
can
finish
the
head
if
you
you
said
matt
flutteringly
he
felt
as
if
herbert
were
heaping
coals
of
fire
upon
his
own
head
repaying
his
first
secret
depreciation
by
praise
he
painted
away
bravely
soon
losing
himself
in
the
happy
travail
of
execution
must
come
down
to
your
place
and
see
your
work
said
herbert
looking
up
from
the
volume
of
swinburne
in
which
he
had
immersed
himself
there
much
said
matt
hastily
bring
you
some
little
things
next
time
only
i
want
your
father
to
see
them
not
for
quite
right
said
herbert
show
to
him
hush
the
matter
asked
matt
turning
his
head
of
the
old
gentleman
said
herbert
the
brush
dropped
from
the
palsied
fingers
he
felt
like
one
caught
he
had
already
come
in
somewhat
surreptitiously
through
the
side
door
in
obedience
to
recommendation
and
to
be
found
using
appliances
and
model
would
be
the
acme
of
guiltiness
the
alarm
was
false
but
thenceforward
old
indicated
matthew
strang
the
elder
for
they
had
frequent
occasion
to
fear
his
advent
since
matt
came
often
tempted
from
his
gloomy
back
room
to
the
beautiful
light
studio
where
he
was
allowed
not
only
to
do
bits
of
work
while
herbert
read
or
gossiped
with
the
model
but
occasionally
to
set
up
another
easel
and
use
the
same
model
but
they
were
only
detected
together
twice
by
the
vandyke
beard
and
the
velvet
coat
and
on
one
occasion
herbert
had
had
time
to
resume
the
brush
and
on
another
to
pose
matt
as
a
model
old
rather
grumpy
about
you
he
admitted
with
his
customary
candor
had
to
tell
the
servant
not
to
mention
your
coming
so
often
the
mashed
on
you
and
i
suppose
a
bit
jealous
she
wanted
to
ask
you
to
our
last
night
we
had
two
associates
and
a
scotch
academician
and
an
american
millionaire
who
buys
any
rot
and
an
art
critic
who
praises
it
but
he
said
one
give
for
relations
but
for
as
matt
had
already
dined
once
with
guileless
homage
at
his
side
to
put
him
at
ease
he
did
not
feel
himself
hardly
used
his
position
with
old
was
not
improved
by
his
demeanor
on
an
occasion
when
meeting
him
in
the
doorway
father
instead
of
raising
remonstrant
eyebrows
astonished
him
by
asking
if
he
would
like
to
see
the
masterpieces
he
had
in
stock
matt
did
not
know
that
this
generous
offer
was
due
to
the
death
of
a
member
of
the
institute
whose
watercolors
had
been
accumulating
on
matthew
hands
and
who
now
even
before
his
funeral
was
showing
signs
of
a
posthumous
he
replied
eagerly
that
nothing
could
be
a
greater
favor
the
waved
his
jewelled
hand
with
pompous
geniality
and
mounting
one
flight
of
stairs
with
the
hand
on
shoulder
ushered
him
into
the
holy
of
holies
a
chamber
religious
with
purple
curtains
and
hushed
with
soft
carpets
where
the
more
precious
pictures
reposed
behind
baize
veils
that
for
possible
purchasers
were
lifted
with
a
reverent
silence
bespeaking
a
hundred
extra
guineas
long
habit
of
ritual
awe
made
matthew
hands
pious
even
before
his
nephew
but
his
expected
ecstasies
were
tempered
by
unexpected
criticism
in
an
eminent
portrait
of
a
lady
matt
pointed
out
that
the
eyes
were
wrong
that
pupils
should
be
round
not
squashy
and
that
the
hot
shadows
made
by
the
indian
reds
under
the
nose
were
inspired
by
romney
he
questioned
the
veracity
of
a
landscape
by
a
costly
name
demurring
to
the
light
on
the
under
sides
of
the
leaves
as
impossible
under
the
conditions
depicted
and
in
a
historical
composition
by
an
old
english
master
he
found
a
lack
of
subtlety
in
the
legs
and
a
stringy
feeling
throughout
all
this
wanton
depreciation
of
goods
by
one
who
was
not
even
an
interested
bargainer
galled
the
conscious
of
overflowing
and
prepared
for
a
natural
return
in
breathless
adoration
so
when
matt
suggested
that
in
a
celebrated
picture
of
a
the
sea
had
no
fluidity
and
was
falling
on
the
heads
he
lost
his
temper
and
cried
sarcastically
think
you
had
better
open
a
school
for
young
man
matt
flushed
feeling
he
had
been
impertinent
then
his
sense
of
justice
repudiated
the
rebuke
it
was
of
no
use
pretending
a
thing
was
right
when
it
he
protested
he
profess
to
get
things
right
himself
and
he
only
wished
he
could
do
anything
half
as
good
as
the
worst
of
these
pictures
but
he
did
know
when
he
was
wrong
even
if
it
come
right
for
all
his
sweating
and
fuming
young
man
to
talk
till
he
can
paint
interrupted
his
uncle
severely
you
know
what
johnson
says
sir
matt
remonstrated
you
make
a
no
sign
you
judge
and
pictures
are
very
different
things
said
matthew
strang
stiffly
as
though
insulted
by
an
implicit
association
with
a
ripping
cried
matt
abandoning
the
argument
at
the
sudden
sight
of
a
fine
mellow
piece
of
the
old
masters
got
the
grays
oh
why
people
wear
wigs
nowadays
this
outburst
of
enthusiasm
made
the
private
exhibition
close
more
auspiciously
than
had
seemed
probable
but
matt
was
never
again
invited
to
inspect
the
sacred
treasures
his
relations
with
his
relatives
came
to
be
limited
to
morning
visits
to
herbert
whose
stairs
he
ascended
half
secretly
to
watch
the
progress
of
his
studies
for
an
ambitious
picture
of
before
nebuchadnezzar
the
models
for
which
he
also
used
himself
he
left
his
own
studies
behind
at
request
though
reluctantly
for
he
was
not
at
all
satisfied
with
them
as
a
species
of
payment
for
the
privilege
when
through
his
interest
in
this
coming
masterpiece
of
and
under
the
fascination
of
this
delightful
and
flattering
friendship
he
forgot
his
pride
and
fell
into
the
habit
of
regular
morning
work
in
company
lunch
somehow
came
up
regularly
for
three
though
madame
was
not
supposed
to
be
aware
of
his
presence
those
were
joyous
lunches
full
of
laughter
and
levity
made
picturesque
by
the
romantic
dress
or
undress
of
the
third
party
and
extra
palatable
for
matt
when
his
first
reluctance
wore
off
by
the
fact
that
they
saved
dinners
before
was
intended
for
next
academy
herbert
told
him
and
he
gathered
from
his
casual
observations
that
it
had
also
to
be
submitted
beforehand
to
the
professors
at
the
schools
for
there
were
strange
cramping
conditions
as
to
the
size
of
the
canvas
and
the
principal
figure
but
he
was
less
interested
in
its
destination
than
in
its
draughtsmanship
he
saw
the
tableau
in
his
eye
the
moment
herbert
told
him
he
was
engaged
upon
it
for
the
scene
had
often
figured
itself
to
his
fancy
in
those
days
when
his
mother
read
the
bible
to
her
helpless
children
by
random
prickings
dream
was
one
of
the
lucky
chapters
to
which
matt
listened
without
distraction
as
the
narrative
unrolled
itself
pictorially
before
his
inner
vision
he
rapidly
sketched
his
conception
then
found
he
disliked
it
and
ultimately
remembered
he
had
unconsciously
reproduced
the
grouping
of
figures
in
the
illustration
in
his
bible
one
of
those
he
had
colored
in
his
childish
naughtiness
herbert
protested
this
was
no
drawback
but
matt
went
away
brooding
over
a
more
artistic
arrangement
and
dreamed
that
he
was
mangled
by
lions
in
a
den
but
in
the
morning
he
brought
a
new
grouping
for
consideration
this
herbert
picked
to
pieces
as
being
against
the
canons
forget
for
the
academy
he
said
make
mistakes
in
grammar
some
of
the
old
buffers
are
worse
than
tarmigan
cried
matt
but
he
had
to
admit
ruefully
that
his
scheme
was
full
of
solecisms
he
had
by
this
time
as
full
an
acquaintance
with
the
rules
as
his
senior
but
with
herbert
they
had
become
instinctive
it
was
with
a
renewed
sense
of
inferiority
to
his
cousin
paradoxically
combined
with
an
inward
raging
against
the
lindley
murrays
of
art
that
matt
abandoned
point
after
point
under
searching
criticism
gift
of
pulling
other
ideas
to
pieces
amounted
to
genius
but
he
abandoned
his
original
sketch
also
dismissed
his
projected
models
and
devoted
himself
to
arguing
out
the
composition
afresh
under
the
banter
of
the
smoking
cynically
on
the
sofa
matt
was
put
upon
his
mettle
to
group
all
the
figures
and
dispose
the
lines
so
as
to
escape
the
pitfalls
lurking
on
every
side
and
likewise
satisfy
the
conditions
of
the
pedantic
professors
must
get
as
much
subject
as
possible
into
it
explained
herbert
give
you
such
a
small
space
only
fifty
by
forty
that
you
must
crowd
all
you
know
into
gradually
the
composition
took
shape
with
infinite
discussion
daily
renewed
matt
was
for
pillars
with
curious
effects
of
architecture
herbert
objected
that
pillars
would
make
the
perspective
too
difficult
and
only
consented
on
the
laughing
stipulation
that
matt
should
work
out
the
angles
and
herbert
was
very
averse
from
suggestions
of
strange
original
attitudes
for
the
figures
make
some
awfully
stiff
foreshortening
he
grumbled
does
it
matter
have
models
matt
would
reply
all
very
well
you
got
to
do
the
work
herbert
would
retort
and
when
the
grouping
was
settled
the
color
and
the
drapery
brought
fresh
argumentation
the
young
men
working
as
at
a
chess
problem
till
the
puzzle
of
arriving
at
the
original
without
deserting
the
academic
was
solved
and
as
in
the
solution
of
a
chess
problem
by
a
pair
of
heads
the
suggestion
of
the
winning
moves
has
been
so
obscured
by
the
indefinite
suggestion
of
abortive
moves
by
both
that
neither
remembers
to
which
the
final
discovery
of
the
right
track
was
due
so
matt
would
have
been
surprised
to
be
told
that
the
ideas
that
had
been
retained
were
all
his
and
the
ideas
that
had
been
rejected
were
all
the
thought
of
apportioning
their
shares
in
the
final
scheme
never
crossed
his
mind
even
though
it
was
his
hand
that
always
held
the
experimentative
pencil
indeed
the
technical
interest
of
the
task
had
absorbed
every
other
thought
and
the
details
of
the
tentative
were
lost
in
the
triumph
of
the
achieved
and
obscured
as
by
a
cigarette
cloud
of
happy
mornings
and
then
herbert
told
his
father
he
must
have
new
models
fresh
to
studios
want
from
haverstock
hill
or
lillie
road
he
said
been
hung
in
every
gallery
i
want
your
italians
from
hatton
garden
or
professionals
that
any
of
the
other
fellows
might
get
hold
of
and
extract
my
ideas
from
besides
new
faces
will
give
me
a
better
and
matthew
strang
the
elder
recognized
there
was
some
reason
in
his
request
but
he
pointed
out
it
was
not
so
easy
to
go
outside
the
stock
families
especially
for
figure
models
and
that
old
hands
often
helped
the
painter
but
herbert
easily
overrode
his
objections
it
was
only
the
conventional
attitudinizings
and
foreshortenings
which
they
understood
the
quotations
of
art
which
he
was
now
about
to
abandon
in
deference
to
paternal
prejudice
and
so
matthew
strang
morbidly
solicitous
obediently
brought
picturesque
orientals
for
daniel
and
the
king
and
the
satraps
and
the
counsellors
and
blushing
brunettes
for
the
beauties
of
the
court
and
herbert
set
to
work
to
reproduce
in
large
on
the
canvas
rough
charcoal
scheme
of
the
whole
and
his
own
or
studies
of
the
parts
and
when
herbert
blundered
matt
suggested
with
pastel
a
change
of
tone
or
color
or
outline
sometimes
even
taking
up
the
brush
when
herbert
was
lazy
as
herbert
often
was
matt
was
never
surprised
to
find
the
work
no
more
advanced
than
when
he
had
gone
away
the
morning
before
for
mind
was
on
many
and
more
important
things
the
academy
students
were
rehearsing
a
burlesque
which
he
had
written
for
their
dramatic
society
and
he
sometimes
slipped
out
to
the
rehearsals
lamenting
to
matt
that
through
his
insistence
on
steady
work
he
could
not
even
play
in
his
own
piece
the
only
recreation
allowed
him
was
a
ride
in
the
park
on
a
hired
hack
and
even
that
he
grumbled
was
to
enable
him
to
salute
cantering
sometimes
he
went
to
tea
with
the
girl
students
at
restaurants
sometimes
he
went
to
balls
and
was
too
tired
on
the
day
after
to
do
anything
but
describe
them
they
were
always
dances
old
gentleman
blocks
others
he
said
on
one
occasion
the
host
was
an
whose
son
was
a
at
the
schools
and
then
old
gentleman
then
there
was
the
ball
to
which
he
convoyed
matt
who
was
quite
dazzled
by
the
elegance
and
refinement
of
the
ladies
and
almost
afraid
to
speak
to
his
partners
and
torn
afresh
with
envy
of
the
beautiful
life
from
which
he
had
been
and
must
long
be
shut
out
not
losing
his
discomfort
till
after
the
supper
at
which
he
tasted
champagne
for
the
first
time
special
circle
danced
the
lancers
with
a
zest
and
that
horrified
some
of
the
matrons
and
brought
back
to
matt
the
dear
old
nights
when
he
took
the
barn
floor
with
little
ruth
hailey
under
the
placid
gaze
of
the
cows
and
amid
the
odors
of
the
stable
and
the
for
other
memorable
experiences
too
matt
was
indebted
to
his
cousin
there
was
club
the
bohemian
a
cosey
little
place
favored
by
actors
and
journalists
caricatures
of
whose
sensuous
faces
lined
the
walls
in
company
with
and
sketches
more
sensuous
still
matt
felt
measureless
reverence
for
the
men
he
brushed
against
here
he
had
seen
some
of
them
before
in
the
illustrated
papers
which
he
read
in
or
penny
or
studio
and
he
trembled
lest
they
should
detect
from
his
embarrassment
amid
the
varied
knives
and
forks
and
glasses
that
he
was
only
a
boor
with
less
education
than
the
waiters
he
wondered
what
the
clever
cultured
people
scraps
of
whose
conversation
floated
across
to
him
amid
the
popping
of
corks
would
think
if
they
knew
he
had
planted
potatoes
chopped
logs
made
sugar
in
the
woods
and
climbed
masts
and
steeples
in
the
new
snobbishness
with
which
their
society
had
infected
him
he
could
not
see
that
these
things
were
education
not
humiliation
and
he
was
glad
that
even
herbert
knew
little
of
his
history
and
asked
less
of
other
histories
on
the
other
hand
matt
heard
a
great
deal
had
robbed
him
of
his
belief
in
royal
virtue
in
the
of
the
bohemians
society
fell
to
pieces
like
a
house
of
cards
in
building
which
as
herbert
once
said
the
knaves
alone
had
been
used
it
was
a
racing
dicing
drinking
swindling
fornicating
fraternity
with
hypocrisy
sincerity
or
simplicity
was
my
eye
there
was
always
money
or
a
woman
or
position
in
the
background
talk
a
lot
of
scandal
matt
once
complained
dear
matt
remonstrated
herbert
not
scandal
gossip
brixton
gossips
about
who
marries
whom
bohemia
about
who
lives
with
whom
scandal
implies
despite
the
scandal
or
the
gossip
matt
was
full
of
curiosity
to
see
this
strange
new
life
of
clubs
and
restaurants
and
theatres
to
which
herbert
sometimes
got
paper
admissions
this
feverish
realm
of
intellect
and
gayety
where
nobody
seemed
to
want
for
anything
but
it
sometimes
came
over
him
with
an
odd
flash
of
surprise
and
bitterness
as
he
caught
the
gleam
of
white
scented
shoulders
or
saw
satyrs
swilling
champagne
that
all
this
settled
luxury
had
been
going
on
while
he
was
tramping
the
snowy
roads
of
what
might
have
been
another
planet
the
feeling
wore
off
as
the
london
season
advanced
and
the
tide
of
luxurious
life
rolled
along
the
great
sunny
thoroughfares
or
flecked
the
midnight
streets
with
darting
points
of
fire
his
puritan
conscience
curiously
persisting
beneath
all
the
scepticism
engendered
by
his
tragedy
had
at
first
acquiesced
but
uneasily
in
the
unscriptural
view
of
life
that
seemed
to
prevail
around
him
but
fainter
and
fainter
grew
its
prickings
the
sensuous
in
him
ripened
in
this
liberal
atmosphere
and
that
greek
conception
of
a
beautiful
world
which
budding
for
him
in
solitude
had
been
almost
nipped
by
the
same
cruel
tragedy
flowered
now
in
the
heats
of
an
ardent
city
old
was
in
such
at
the
surprising
progress
of
before
that
gentle
remonstrance
that
he
ought
to
do
something
for
matt
touched
a
responsive
chord
and
before
the
academy
day
matt
had
the
privilege
of
being
escorted
by
his
uncle
in
company
with
herbert
to
a
at
the
reynolds
club
of
which
the
dealer
was
a
member
herbert
was
soon
lost
in
the
crush
of
painters
and
engravers
and
obscurely
famous
visitors
who
gathered
before
the
academy
pictures
that
lined
the
walls
or
the
entertainers
who
struck
attitudes
on
the
daïs
but
matt
was
too
nervous
amid
this
congestion
of
celebrities
to
detach
himself
from
his
uncle
who
did
the
honors
grandly
pointing
out
the
lions
of
the
club
with
a
proprietorial
air
matt
could
not
but
feel
that
his
uncle
who
was
of
the
minority
was
himself
one
of
the
lions
of
the
club
and
in
very
truth
he
was
its
most
member
refreshments
are
not
gratis
he
told
matt
of
course
you
can
have
anything
you
like
at
my
expense
will
you
have
a
cup
of
coffee
or
are
you
one
of
those
degenerate
young
men
who
live
without
but
matt
had
no
appetite
for
anything
he
was
too
fluttered
by
this
close
contact
with
the
giants
of
the
brush
he
listened
eagerly
to
morsels
of
their
dialogue
strained
his
vision
to
see
them
through
the
smoky
lamplit
air
critical
as
he
might
have
been
and
was
before
their
work
the
men
themselves
were
shrouded
in
a
vague
splendor
of
achievement
they
had
all
been
hung
there
seemed
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
a
virulent
article
of
comprehensive
condemnation
in
the
art
columns
of
the
everybody
seemed
to
have
read
it
and
nobody
to
have
written
it
for
the
rest
compliments
crossed
like
smiling
couples
in
the
quadrille
a
stunning
landscape
that
is
of
yours
rapper
said
wilfred
smith
a
journalist
so
ignorant
of
painting
that
he
was
suspected
of
art
criticism
like
a
nothing
just
knocked
off
for
a
old
johnny
who
admires
me
replied
rapper
deprecatingly
he
was
a
man
with
a
double
eyeglass
on
a
gold
cord
rotten
really
awfully
ashamed
of
and
he
elbowed
his
way
towards
it
he
ought
to
be
and
so
ought
you
to
be
ashamed
wilfred
said
morrison
the
poet
of
pessimism
and
just
like
those
splashes
of
silvery
gray
they
sell
for
corots
on
the
what
i
meant

wilfred
you

clinch
gruffly
what
i
meant
not

wilfred
unabashed
matt
stared
with
interest
at
the
picture
which
was
just
beside
him
the
face
was
indeed
exquisite
with
the
peculiar
delicacy
of
pastel
he
looked
at
the
own
face
coarse
and
splotched
the
teeth
fouled
by
endless
tobacco
it
was
as
though
pan
should
paint

said
the
poet
smiling
clinch
damned
the
in
a
string
of
unlovely
oaths
which
were
drowned
by
the
music
of
a
violin
and
a
piano
he
did
not
care
a
twopenny
damn
what
people
scribbled
about
him
his
pictures
were
there
just
the
same
what
does
mean
old
man
said
the
poet
appealingly
clinch
replied
that
literary
fellows
were
invariably
sanguinary
fools
who
fancied
that
painting
meant
things
and
could
be
explained
in
words
he
had
just
been
reading
about
the
significance
of
backgrounds
in
some
rotten
book
on
the
renaissance
in
reality
those
bits
of
landscape
must
have
been
put
in
and
painted
out
a
dozen
times
before
leonardo
had
struck
the
he
tried
after
morrison
retorted
that
if
the
could
paint
he
would
become
a
partisan
tied
to
his
own
talent
as
it
was
he
could
approach
other
pictures
without
prejudice
also
without
knowledge
clinch
replied
goaded
he
pointed
out
brutally
that
to
learn
painting
meant
to
learn
a
new
set
of
symbols
you
wanted
to
paint
that
lamp
he
said
probably
put
down
a
line
to
get
that
edge
and
so
lose
all
the
softness
a
real
line
look
a
bit
like
the
real
thing
same
with
color
real
red
give
red
painting
is
all
subterfuge
optical
illusion
color
and
form
are
only
an
affair
of
he
went
on
to
explain
with
punctilious
profanities
that
to
study
the
relation
of
that
lamp
to
the
was
enough
for
a
picture
treated
perfectly
there
would
be
a
poetry
and
mystery
about
it
beauty
too
was
only
an
affair
of
relations
and
in
he
had
been
trying
to
get
a
beautiful
relation
between
two
ugly
things
and
an
early
georgian
feeling
into
a
interior
with
a
scientific
accuracy
of
tones
known
only
to
modern
french
art
matt
listened
eagerly
wincing
a
little
at
the
livelier
oaths
but
conscious
of
piquant
perspectives
of
novel
artistic
vision
which
if
not
quite
intelligible
was
in
refreshing
contrast
with
orthodoxy
you
had
the
same
woman
in
your
picture
of
the
lass
persisted
the
poet
clinch
explained
that
if
writing
chaps
knew
what
it
was
to
hunt
for
a
satisfactory
model
thank
their
stars
they
know
a
palette
from
a
planchette
a
that
really
expressed
your
idea
you
get
to
sit
for
you
and
if
you
could
get
her
you
swear
at
her
besides
it
was
his
ambition
to
create
a
new
type
of
feminine
beauty
and
impose
her
on
his
period
femme
de
wilfred
smith
took
mental
notes
prepared
henceforward
to
expound
clinch
to
an
ignorant
world
about
time
he
got
a
new
model
anyway
he
said
when
the
artist
had
moved
off
painted
her
added
morrison
dryly
matt
had
a
flash
of
resentment
the
picture
was
to
him
a
dainty
dream
of
cool
color
and
graceful
form
despite
his
association
with
herbert
he
did
not
yet
understand
the
temperament
that
strides
to
wit
over
body
it
funny
a
man
like
that
should
draw
such
refined
women
he
could
not
help
remarking
to
his
cicerone
matthew
strang
assumed
an
oracular
expression
just
a
knack
he
said
got
to
be
born
with
it
i
the
pity
but
herbert
makes
up
for
it
thank
heaven
got
nothing
to
do
with
character
paid
many
a
man
to
do
me
so
many
a
year
and
do
you
suppose
i
ever
got
them
the
rogues
get
drunk
or
die
or
something
but
they
never
come
up
to
matt
was
puzzled
if
art
demanded
anything
it
seemed
to
him
it
was
steadfastness
and
sobriety
the
truth
about
it
seemed
to
lie
in
those
lines
he
had
read
in
a
volume
of
matthew
arnold
borrowed
from
herbert
gay
radiant
adorned
outside
a
hidden
ground
of
thought
and
of
austerity
a
sudden
fear
that
he
was
not
a
genius
himself
was
like
a
knife
through
his
heart
laying
bare
with
painful
incision
its
secret
hope
you
think
clinch
gets
his
effects
without
bothering
he
asked
with
anxiety
heavens
no
said
matthew
strang
authoritatively
once
watched
him
at
work
he
was
squatted
on
a
tiny
stool
looking
up
at
his
picture
and
painting
upward
he
had
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
which
he
was
always
relighting
every
now
and
then
he
would
sigh
heavily
or
swear
at
himself
or
his
model
and
sometimes
he
would
go
and
lie
on
the
and
stare
solemnly
at
the
canvas
then
jump
up
give
one
touch
swear
if
it
went
wrong
paint
it
out
and
then
go
and
stand
in
the
corner
with
his
face
to
the
wall
probably
in
meditation
but
looking
exactly
like
a
naughty
little
boy
at
matt
smiled
half
at
the
picture
of
clinch
in
the
corner
half
from
relief
at
finding
that
even
men
who
swore
and
drank
far
more
than
he
did
suffered
quite
as
acutely
in
the
parturition
of
the
beautiful
he
fell
back
on
the
theory
of
an
essential
inner
delicacy
behind
the
occasionally
coarse
envelope
of
artistic
genius
just
as
grossness
could
lurk
beneath
a
gentlemanly
refinement
they
ultimately
found
herbert
in
the
with
a
cue
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
want
to
look
at
the
pictures
he
protested
decent
see
them
in
the
academy
and
if
rot
waste
of
time
seeing
them
at
all
as
for
the
entertainment
you
can
get
a
better
at
any
at
least
so
been
nevertheless
he
himself
took
matt
to
another
the
same
week
the
far
more
homely
gathering
of
the
sketching
club
where
the
refreshments
gratis
and
evening
dress
was
taboo
and
really
famous
people
scrambled
for
the
and
beer
of
which
there
was
not
enough
and
members
disported
themselves
in
their
costumes
for
the
edification
of
a
company
which
had
turned
its
back
on
their
pictures
for
the
academy
itself
matt
paid
his
shilling
into
such
extravagant
habits
had
he
slipped
since
the
days
of
his
arrival
in
london
when
a
national
gallery
catalogue
was
beyond
his
far
fatter
purse
but
he
came
away
much
less
inspired
than
from
that
momentous
visit
his
imagination
untouched
save
once
or
twice
as
by
personalized
projections
of
mediæval
romance
in
which
the
absence
of
real
atmosphere
seemed
only
natural
there
were
so
many
smooth
portraits
of
uninteresting
people
that
he
was
reminded
drearily
of
his
drudgery
when
his
spirit
had
to
stoop
to
portray
and
please
some
tedious
farmer
who
was
sometimes
not
even
picturesque
it
did
not
occur
to
him
how
unfair
was
the
latent
comparison
with
the
national
gallery
he
forgot
that
art
is
short
and
the
academy
long
that
one
can
no
more
expect
a
batch
of
great
pictures
every
year
than
a
batch
of
great
novels
or
of
great
symphonies
tarmigan
had
a
picture
of
rape
of
the
it
was
hung
on
the
line
and
was
very
proud
of
it
in
the
discussion
on
the
academy
which
supplied
the
class
with
the
materials
for
a
carping
it
was
the
only
picture
that
escaped
even
depreciation
though
he
declared
he
would
never
himself
paint
like
that
which
the
wag
eagerly
admitted
one
of
the
students
had
secured
a
place
in
the
and
his
success
made
matt
regret
he
himself
had
not
dared
to
send
in
own
contribution
had
been
rejected
which
made
his
pupils
think
more
highly
of
themselves
matt
was
more
interested
in
the
azure
art
gallery
a
little
exhibition
mainly
of
landscapes
with
violet
shadows
held
by
some
young
men
about
whom
herbert
was
enthusiastic
for
they
did
not
attempt
said
he
to
vie
either
with
the
camera
or
the
conte
painting
be
an
art
at
all
he
contended
can
only
be
so
by
virtue
of
ignoring
nature
as
goethe
said
call
art
art
because
it
is
not
the
musician
works
up
notes
the
poet
syllables
into
a
music
unlike
anything
in
nature
and
so
must
the
painter
work
up
colors
and
forms
under
the
sole
guidance
of
his
artistic
instinct
and
whatever
can
be
better
expressed
in
words
has
no
place
in
painting
these
young
pictures
tell
no
stories
and
no
truths
either
they
are
merely
concerned
with
color
and
matt
afterwards
found
that
with
the
exception
of
a
couple
of
scotchmen
these
young
men
by
no
means
accepted
account
of
their
aims
indeed
they
rather
regarded
it
as
satirical
for
to
give
truer
impressions
of
nature
was
precisely
their
boast
and
glory
although
matt
could
not
always
credit
them
with
success
in
this
still
he
found
a
note
of
life
and
fantasy
in
their
work
he
was
especially
struck
by
on
fire
in
fitzroy
a
flight
of
sparks
falling
and
curving
in
a
golden
rain
in
vivid
contrast
with
the
dark
starlit
sky
above
and
the
black
mass
of
spectators
below
faintly
illumined
by
and
broken
at
the
extreme
end
by
the
brassy
gleam
of
the
tearing
up
the
street
there
were
inaccuracies
of
detail
but
matt
was
immensely
impressed
by
the
originality
of
the
subject
and
the
touch
of
weirdness
and
it
was
with
joy
that
he
accepted
offer
to
take
him
to
the
azure
art
club
where
cornpepper
and
his
clique
mostly
forgathered
since
herbert
had
misinterpreted
them
to
his
cousin
matt
had
read
a
good
deal
about
them
in
the
papers
and
they
had
held
forth
brilliantly
to
interviewers
on
the
veracity
of
their
rendering
of
nature
cornpepper
going
so
far
as
to
claim
that
you
could
not
look
at
his
landscapes
without
feeling
from
the
color
of
stone
and
sea
from
the
tints
of
the
sky
and
the
disposition
of
the
clouds
what
it
was
whereupon
the
interviewer
had
consulted
a
study
of
poppies
on
a
cliff
and
reported
that
it
was
eleven
cornpepper
crying
all
of
which
did
not
fail
to
provoke
counterblasts
from
the
academic
camp
and
from
the
irresponsible
concocters
of
facetious
paragraphs
it
was
all
very
small
the
feeble
british
refraction
of
the
great
gallic
battle
then
waging
of
the
campaign
of
plein
air
and
modern
subject
against
bituminous
landscapes
and
classic
conventions
the
expurgated
english
edition
of
the
eternal
battle
of
youth
and
age
spiritless
as
the
bouts
of
boxers
in
a
quaker
land
or
the
shadowy
warfare
of
art
in
a
puritan
country
vibrating
only
to
politics
and
religion
indifferent
to
style
gauging
literature
merely
by
its
message
and
art
by
its
idea
but
matt
was
not
a
briton
and
his
own
aversion
from
an
unreal
nature
doctored
and
tricked
up
in
which
an
artificial
chiaroscuro
took
the
place
of
observation
and
atmosphere
led
him
into
instant
sympathy
with
this
painting
of
moments
with
this
presentation
of
caught
in
the
fact
as
cornpepper
brilliantly
defined
the
impressionism
he
had
smuggled
over
from
paris
even
if
nature
was
not
so
violet
as
she
was
painted
matt
felt
the
mistake
was
on
the
right
side
and
who
but
cornpepper
had
revealed
and
interpreted
the
mystery
and
poetry
of
the
night
true
he
was
rather
staggered
to
remember
it
was
impossible
to
paint
the
night
with
your
eye
on
the
object
the
night
side
of
nature
might
be
caught
in
the
fact
it
could
not
be
arrested
in
the
fact
herbert
was
not
a
member
of
the
azure
art
club
they
had
to
call
on
a
man
in
kensington
to
get
him
to
take
them
there
he
proved
to
be
no
other
than
the
rapper
whom
herbert
had
invited
to
invite
them
to
dinner
an
awful
duffer
he
said
enviously
he
has
a
flat
of
his
own
and
an
income
of
his
own
and
had
the
run
of
copenhagen
paris
and
antwerp
they
say
copenhagen
is
worse
than
rapper
made
them
stay
to
admire
his
rooms
look
at
my
pictures
he
said
only
a
portrait
doing
of
riggs
the
keeper
an
awful
duffer
why
i
should
get
so
many
commissions
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
when
lots
of
geniuses
starving
i
never
can
make
out
i
suppose
because
i
want
the
money
i
shall
only
blue
it
at
monte
carlo
only
just
come
back
from
the
country
a
an
awful
screw
he
made
me
do
him
and
his
wife
for
still
only
do
try
some
of
this
burgundy
genuine
i
import
it
direct
from
a
small
grower
i
get
a
huge
barrel
for
five
pounds
and
pay
three
pounds
duty
and
get
hundreds
of
bottles
out
of
it
people
know
how
to
get
wine
in
england
oh
do
please
look
at
that
limoges
enamel
over
the
strang
far
better
worth
looking
at
than
that
daub
of
a
always
prefer
to
look
at
pictures
said
matt
apologetically
rather
a
strong
bit
of
color
admitted
rapper
do
you
think
the
light
is
accounted
for
asked
matt
red
glow
you
see
the
library
lamp
rejoined
rapper
but
the
off
and
even
then
it
more
like
firelight
a
bit
of
it
replied
rapper
hotly
you
suppose
i
study
the
effects
with
a
lighted
lamp
a
good
bit
of
action
in
the
old
arm
reaching
for
the
matt
examined
it
carefully
forearm
is
a
little
out
of
drawing
it
a
little
too
long
he
asked
timidly
dear
fellow
the
model
had
an
unusually
long
forearm
you
suppose
everybody
is
alike
of
course
it
near
finished
yet
but
really
i
was
trying
for
color
more
than
for
line
and
after
all
the
careless
draughtsmanship
of
a
man
who
can
draw
it
attracted
quite
a
lot
of
notice
at
the
azure
art
gallery
last
year
but
i
put
a
big
price
on
it
so
that
it
sell
and
have
time
to
work
it
up
a
little
bust
of
myself
only
plaster
of
paris
bronzed
over
i
model
ever
so
much
better
than
i
paint
but
nobody
will
give
me
a
commission
it
funny
do
have
some
more
of
the
burgundy
not
much
of
an
artist
but
i
flatter
myself
i
do
know
a
good
before
they
left
he
presented
them
with
photographs
of
his
library
picture
apparently
forgetting
that
he
near
finished
it
say
i
go
about
with
you
if
you
go
on
like
this
whispered
herbert
to
matt
as
rapper
lingered
to
extinguish
his
gas
and
lock
his
door
telling
a
chap
his
faults
you
go
by
me
and
my
nebuchadnezzar
i
rather
like
to
be
pitched
into
it
keeps
a
fellow
from
getting
know
matt
murmured
with
a
new
admiration
for
herbert
who
had
already
become
a
hero
to
him
moving
so
brilliantly
amid
all
these
shining
circles
the
three
young
men
got
into
a
hansom
and
smoked
cigars
at
the
little
club
which
was
only
ten
minutes
off
they
dined
in
a
long
narrow
room
with
a
near
the
door
several
men
whose
work
matt
had
studied
with
interest
were
dining
in
their
vicinity
matt
strained
his
ears
to
catch
their
conversation
but
it
seemed
to
be
all
about
the
an
apparently
recent
acquisition
at
last
to
his
joy
he
was
introduced
to
some
of
the
most
famous
to
butler
tall
dark
muscular
and
most
erratic
of
etchers
most
of
painters
to
the
clinch
to
gurney
slim
youthful
and
habited
in
tweeds
the
latest
recruit
an
earnest
disciple
of
every
master
in
turn
old
or
new
always
in
superlatives
of
eulogy
or
abuse
and
untaught
by
his
own
gyrations
to
respect
a
past
adoration
or
to
tone
down
a
present
to
greme
more
barefacedly
boyish
than
even
herbert
a
blonde
youth
credited
by
his
admirers
with
a
charming
new
blond
vision
of
nature
though
the
philistines
contended
that
all
he
did
was
to
get
effects
with
oils
to
simpson
who
ground
his
own
colors
and
had
mysterious
glazes
and
varnishes
and
was
consumed
by
an
unshared
anxiety
as
to
the
permanence
of
his
pictures
and
oh
awful
joy
to
the
great
cornpepper
the
most
brilliant
and
the
youngest
of
them
all
a
squat
juvenile
figure
with
a
supercilious
in
the
right
eye
a
nose
and
a
habit
of
rasping
the
middle
of
his
seat
with
his
hands
like
an
owl
on
a
perch
matt
was
dying
to
talk
to
them
and
especially
to
cornpepper
of
their
art
as
to
men
who
had
already
done
something
in
the
world
through
which
they
moved
burdened
with
aspirations
and
haloed
with
dreams
but
the
talk
would
not
veer
round
to
painting
and
the
evening
was
entirely
devoted
to
a
general
game
of
with
halfpenny
points
matt
was
drawn
into
taking
a
cue
and
lost
one
and
threepence
halfpenny
in
the
first
game
his
inexperience
being
aggravated
by
whispered
caution
not
to
cut
the
cloth
however
his
skilled
eye
and
hand
practised
with
gun
and
brush
soon
told
and
he
won
his
money
back
in
the
second
much
to
his
relief
for
his
funds
were
running
away
at
an
appalling
rate
the
strenuous
leaders
of
the
newest
art
movement
relaxed
over
the
green
table
highly
hilarious
as
the
white
ball
ran
among
the
red
balls
like
a
to
drive
them
into
the
pockets
and
stamping
and
contorting
themselves
in
mock
applause
after
a
failure
to
score
a
fluke
herbert
would
say
when
the
failure
was
his
and
the
jest
became
a
catchword
provocative
of
perpetual
cachinnation
there
were
so
many
hands
in
the
game
that
matt
had
plenty
of
time
for
occasional
remarks
between
his
turns
but
nobody
would
speak
of
art
except
a
venerable
graybeard
named
brinkside
who
talked
to
him
enthusiastically
of
the
azure
art
campaign
he
told
him
of
the
heroism
of
its
leaders
of
how
cornpepper
had
lived
on
dates
and
water
while
doing
illustrations
for
the
salvation
subjects
at
starvation
prices
of
how
the
even
sturdier
butler
had
slept
in
a
refusing
to
compromise
with
his
genius
or
to
modify
the
great
dabs
of
paint
that
the
world
mistook
for
daubs
in
answer
to
inquiries
the
old
man
explained
to
him
how
cornpepper
painted
his
night
scenes
by
putting
down
at
fever
heat
in
the
morning
some
beautiful
effect
noted
and
absorbed
the
night
before
in
the
evening
cornpepper
would
return
to
the
spot
brinkside
said
but
if
despite
all
his
waiting
he
could
not
see
the
same
effect
he
would
wilfully
forget
the
second
impression
and
return
again
and
again
till
the
first
conditions
were
repeated
matt
relieved
to
find
that
method
was
similar
to
his
own
and
that
genius
had
no
esoteric
prerogatives
of
method
pointed
out
that
in
infinite
permutations
an
effect
never
recurred
exactly
as
before
and
that
therefore
he
for
his
part
contented
himself
with
storing
up
in
his
mind
the
main
values
and
relying
on
deduction
for
the
minutiæ
but
of
course
it
all
depended
on
holding
the
total
effect
the
original
sensation
vividly
in
the
memory
on
leaving
he
thanked
brinkside
with
touching
humility
for
the
instructive
interest
of
his
conversation
to
find
an
old
man
in
a
new
movement
he
observed
suddenly
to
herbert
in
their
homeward
hansom
not
old
men
often
creep
in
their
last
chance
but
if
brinkside
thinking
of
not
an
artist
at
all
an
colorman
who
supplied
with
their
materials
on
tick
before
they
caught
on
like
a
i
used
to
know
at
brighton
who
financed
lovely
woman
till
she
married
wealthy
flats
he
foresaw
they
would
get
on
and
by
jove
they
are
blazing
away
like
a
house
on
fire
or
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
like
a
chimney
on
the
opposition
to
the
academy
is
flourishing
cried
matt
joyfully
his
vague
youthful
sympathy
with
all
that
was
fresh
and
young
was
strengthened
and
made
concrete
by
the
revelations
of
struggle
and
starvation
in
the
lives
of
those
that
had
preceded
him
martyred
for
the
faith
that
was
in
them
it
is
flourishing
said
herbert
much
so
that
in
ten
time
most
of
will
be
academicians
or
associates
if
i
were
the
governor
buy
up
now
but
got
no
said
matt
disappointed
you
mean
the
academy
will
win
after
all
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
be
half
accepted
and
half
toned
down
already
greme
and
butler
are
married
and
the
beginning
of
the
end
lucky
beggars
supplied
with
enthusiasm
in
their
youth
and
comfort
in
their
old
age
i
wish
i
was
young
nonsense
never
was
young
said
herbert
shaking
his
head
always
saw
through
everything
heigho
give
us
a
light
from
your
cigar
sighed
mine
suppose
very
grateful
to
brinkside
said
matt
when
the
fire
of
cigar
was
rekindled
play
billiards
with
him
but
i
suppose
squared
up
making
money
now
urged
matt
horrified
years
of
bitter
slavery
to
domestic
liabilities
had
unfitted
him
to
understand
this
laxity
of
financial
fibre
then
why
be
rash
one
foresee
the
before
the
magnificence
of
this
rebuke
matt
shrank
abashed
he
had
a
sneaking
twinge
of
shame
and
concern
for
his
own
homely
honesty
as
for
something
inauspiciously
inartistic
of
money
went
on
herbert
devilish
hard
up
myself
for
a
day
or
two
bills
to
meet
at
once
and
my
allowance
come
due
for
a
few
days
you
advance
me
a
trifle
i
suppose
course
i
could
said
matt
eagerly
you
think
you
could
let
me
have
a
pony
pony
repeated
matt
mystified
pounds
do
it
if
it
will
at
all
inconvenience
matt
was
glad
that
it
was
too
dark
for
herbert
to
read
his
face
the
sum
was
by
far
the
greater
portion
of
his
worldly
possessions
but
he
did
not
hesitate
herbert
would
refund
it
in
a
day
or
two
will
bring
it
to
the
studio
he
said
a
good
chap
said
herbert
got
to
go
to
studio
next
sunday
cried
matt
in
delighted
excitement
he
told
me
he
like
to
ask
you
direct
because
you
looked
so
serious
and
protested
matt
with
a
vague
sense
of
insult
you
do
no
denying
it
remember
how
you
preached
to
me
about
the
governor
the
first
time
you
saw
me
perhaps
go
lecturing
cornpepper
because
he
economizes
by
domesticating
his
model
when
he
has
a
big
picture
on
the
easel
personally
i
like
cornpepper
he
is
the
only
fellow
who
has
the
courage
of
his
want
of
principles
in
this
whitewashed
sepulchre
of
a
country
but
be
careful
that
you
talk
to
him
as
you
did
to
rapper
for
he
lives
up
to
his
name
he
is
awfully
peppery
when
you
tread
on
his
corns
though
he
has
no
objection
to
stamping
on
yours
not
that
i
believe
any
real
malice
in
him
but
they
say
his
master
at
the
was
a
very
quarrelsome
fellow
and
my
opinion
is
that
he
models
himself
on
him
and
thinks
that
to
quarrel
with
everybody
is
to
be
a
great
but
you
think
he
be
a
great
artist
said
matt
a
great
artist
but
he
be
said
herbert
be
an
by
jove
we
nearly
ran
over
that
guardsman
mary
ann
has
been
standing
him
too
many
drinks
do
you
know
the
price
of
a
guardsman
matt
price
a
who
wishes
to
be
seen
walking
out
with
a
swagger
soldier
has
to
give
him
half
a
crown
and
his
herbert
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
showing
off
to
matt
his
knowledge
of
the
inner
working
of
the
great
social
machine
madame
passing
her
white
hand
lovingly
over
her
hair
had
no
idea
of
the
serpentine
wisdom
garnered
in
the
brain
beneath
at
the
marble
arch
matt
carefully
bearing
the
photograph
of
got
out
of
the
hansom
to
exchange
to
a
which
passed
near
his
street
he
offered
to
pay
his
share
of
the
hansom
but
herbert
waved
the
silver
aside
with
princely
magnificence
chapter
v
a
symposium
desire
to
hear
the
brotherhood
of
the
brush
on
art
was
gratified
at
for
a
batch
of
artists
of
all
ages
together
with
a
couple
of
journalists
assembled
in
the
big
bare
studio
to
smoke
their
own
pipes
and
to
say
to
the
model
who
dispensed
the
whiskey
some
declared
they
wanted
it
neat
to
take
off
the
effects
of
a
grewsome
tale
with
which
rapper
had
started
the
evening
it
was
about
the
time
when
he
had
studied
art
in
berlin
and
attended
anatomy
class
not
much
of
an
artist
but
i
do
know
anatomy
he
interpolated
one
day
when
the
corpse
upon
which
the
professor
was
about
to
demonstrate
was
uncovered
the
students
recognized
to
their
horror
a
favorite
who
had
been
away
for
a
few
days
he
had
been
taken
ill
in
his
garret
conveyed
to
the
hospital
and
being
alone
in
the
world
had
been
sold
to
the
the
startled
class
immediately
subscribed
for
another
corpse
and
buried
the
unfortunate
boy
with
due
honors
greme
tried
to
counteract
this
tale
by
another
one
about
a
model
an
old
fellow
named
william
tell
who
after
vainly
applying
at
the
slade
and
lambeth
schools
for
work
had
been
taken
up
by
the
sketching
club
for
the
sake
of
his
picturesque
corded
breeches
when
at
the
end
of
the
two
spell
the
men
were
criticising
one
work
one
said
to
another
seem
any
leg
under
those
overhearing
which
william
tell
fell
to
indignantly
unbuttoning
his
gaiters
the
arrival
of
a
caricaturist
joyously
greeted
by
all
as
dispelled
the
last
flavors
of
the
mortuary
you
in
china
everybody
asked
jimmy
explained
he
had
thrown
up
the
commission
but
was
off
to
the
west
indies
next
month
though
he
expected
to
find
himself
in
paris
instead
he
was
a
genius
with
an
infinite
capacity
for
taking
pains
and
making
friends
and
being
forced
to
rise
in
the
small
hours
to
get
through
his
work
before
the
countless
callers
arrived
to
distract
him
was
popularly
supposed
to
be
an
idle
scapegrace
who
produced
sketches
as
rapidly
and
copiously
as
the
conjurer
produces
oranges
from
his
breath
was
almost
taken
away
in
a
rush
of
reverence
and
rapture
at
the
unexpected
privilege
of
seeing
him
for
despite
his
own
craving
for
the
sublime
and
the
beautiful
jimmy
sketches
of
low
london
life
had
for
him
a
magnetic
appeal
whose
strength
surprised
himself
sometimes
he
fancied
it
was
the
humor
and
the
fun
that
held
him
as
being
the
qualities
in
which
he
himself
was
most
deficient
sometimes
it
flashed
upon
him
obscurely
as
in
a
light
thrown
through
a
fog
that
jimmy
raven
was
teaching
him
to
see
the
spectacle
of
life
more
deeply
and
truthfully
through
the
medium
of
his
humorous
vision
at
such
instants
he
almost
thought
one
of
loafers
worth
a
whole
academy
of
poetic
myths
but
he
suppressed
the
suspicion
as
absurd
and
perturbing
to
his
own
ideals
and
vision
telling
himself
it
was
only
the
truth
and
subtlety
of
the
draughtsmanship
that
he
admired
he
listened
to
him
now
as
eagerly
and
deferentially
as
to
cornpepper
his
eyes
fixed
mainly
on
these
two
famous
faces
as
if
to
seize
the
secret
of
their
gifts
in
some
contour
of
nose
or
chin
but
he
had
ample
curiosity
and
respect
to
spend
even
on
the
other
men
though
below
all
his
real
modesty
and
diffidence
was
a
curious
of
strength
as
of
a
talent
that
might
hope
one
day
to
be
recognized
even
of
these
but
there
was
little
to
be
got
out
of
jimmy
having
likewise
said
he
launched
into
an
account
of
an
east
end
girl
he
had
sketched
that
morning
in
the
park
and
quoted
her
idea
of
a
coster
gentleman
a
toff
he
had
overheard
her
boasting
wears
three
rows
of
buttons
down
his
trousers
and
sixteen
wentilation
in
who
do
you
think
i
saw
in
the
park
he
went
on
cried
various
voices
was
he
preaching
said
jimmy
sitting
to
winkelman
that
old
chap
who
became
a
buddhist
when
he
was
painting
those
eastern
things
the
critics
made
such
a
fuss
there
was
a
laugh
at
the
expense
of
the
mohammedan
model
who
always
suited
his
religion
to
his
i
did
him
said
jimmy
pretended
to
be
a
jew
and
it
was
great
fun
after
he
became
a
jew
to
tell
him
i
was
a
christian
i
know
which
was
the
biggest
lie
he
added
with
his
droll
twinkle
you
hear
about
the
hindoo
who
went
to
see
things
at
said
butler
spat
out
you
see
he
knew
the
real
he
smiled
with
grim
satisfaction
for
the
things
were
licked
and
stippled
into
a
meretricious
poetry
and
his
own
bold
blobs
of
oriental
color
had
been
laughed
at
you
wish
they
supplied
spittoons
at
the
academy
asked
jimmy
it
was
the
red
rag
for
the
next
ten
minutes
the
absurdities
of
the
academy
and
the
transcendent
merits
of
the
salon
which
most
of
them
had
run
over
to
paris
to
see
occupied
the
tapis
and
then
a
spectacled
scotchman
who
answered
to
the
name
of
mack
dilated
upon
the
decadence
of
the
grisette
and
the
degeneracy
of
the
orgies
but
still
paris
stands
for
the
joy
of
life
said
cornpepper
are
not
ashamed
of
ought
to
be
said
matt
and
the
company
laughed
as
at
a
good
joke
young
friend
thinks
the
artist
should
be
moral
said
herbert
paternally
say
art
should
be
moral
next
said
mack
immoral
is
it
said
matt
feebly
as
usual
he
was
half
fascinated
half
shocked
by
the
freedom
of
the
artistic
standpoint
for
which
his
intellect
was
ready
but
not
his
deeper
organization
he
wondered
again
why
he
was
so
uncomfortably
constructed
and
he
envied
these
others
for
whom
their
art
seemed
to
flow
in
happy
irrelation
to
conduct
and
character
or
at
least
to
the
moral
ideals
of
the
bourgeois
he
marvelled
at
them
too
not
understanding
how
talents
more
subconscious
than
his
own
could
lie
in
closed
compartments
as
it
were
of
the
minds
apparently
unaffected
by
the
experiences
of
their
temporary
owners
neither
moral
nor
immoral
pronounced
the
little
host
magisterially
as
he
grasped
his
perch
more
tightly
more
than
lunar
or
calendar
the
artist
thinks
and
feels
in
line
and
color
he
sees
nature
green
or
gray
according
to
his
temperament
there
are
as
many
views
from
richmond
hill
as
there
are
artists
if
two
views
are
alike
one
is
a
plagiarism
nature
will
never
be
exhausted
for
every
man
sees
her
so
long
as
he
see
her
double
put
in
jimmy
so
said
cornpepper
long
as
he
too
drunk
to
keep
his
brush
steady
we
ask
no
more
of
him
in
fact
always
best
to
be
in
love
with
your
sitter
what
gives
said
a
septuagenarian
who
had
been
smoking
in
silent
amusement
comes
merely
from
painting
with
brushes
too
large
for
the
there
rocks
said
jimmy
want
any
of
your
revolutionary
notions
here
what
would
you
say
if
we
denounced
jammy
shadows
at
the
academy
dinner
yourself
cried
cornpepper
rather
angrily
is
liberty
hall
i
be
classed
with
the
new
school
or
with
any
success
had
already
made
him
feel
the
of
an
extravagant
school
with
which
one
is
confounded
i
exhibit
with
you
chaps
people
credit
me
with
all
your
views
you
might
as
well
say
i
agree
with
the
president
because
on
the
line
in
the
you
got
a

in
the
academy

notice
it
said
wilfred

the

expressing
what
was
in

too
you
are
laughed
rocks
you
come
among
us
lost
only
by
our
rejecting
you
that
we
make
you
famous
when
you
exhibit
by
yourselves
you
stand
allow
rocks
to
talk
said
little
cornpepper
with
a
smile
was
the
first
to
detect
my
talent
and
i
am
really
sorry
to
be
the
last
to
detect
his
i
think
his
big
nudes
are
shocking
he
and
tarmigan
are
a
pair
where
is
the
point
of
painting
heathen
mythology
only
paint
the
nude
because
i
paint
clothes
said
rocks
smiling
are
all
so
versatile
come
round
to
the
classic
too
one
day
said
butler
with
a
weary
expression
on
his
strong
stern
face
should
have
seen
his
joy
when
he
got
the
invitation
for
of
the
sort
cried
little
cornpepper
glaring
through
his
and
humping
himself
into
a
more
curve
even
accept
the
invitation
i
going
to
help
the
to
correct
their
the
glare
relaxed
under
his
pleasure
at
the
laugh
and
he
added
more
quietly
let
us
drop
shop
for
sake
not
one
of
a
school
myself
and
i
say
salvation
lies
with
any
sect
give
me
style
all
i
ask
you
have
it
neat
murmured
jimmy
not
school
pursued
cornpepper
pleased
with
the
phrase
literature
style
in
boccaccio
and
style
in
flaubert
and
style
in
wycherley
even
a
moral
work
may
pass
if
it
has
style
satires
for
instance
so
too
in
painting
i
find
style
in
bouguereau
or
fred
walker
in
rocks
or
tarmigan
who
are
only
fit
for
chromos
but
i
do
find
it
in

in
fortuny
in
degas

and
jimmy
sat
down
going
to
be

a
it

no
right
to

for

cried
herbert
mack
lived
up
to
his
principles
for
he
always
saw
nature
as
a
pretty
pattern
an
accident
look
at
the
blottesque
effects
you
get
in
said
rocks
last
and
greatest
art
the
art
to
blot
quoted
levison
the
second
journalist
who
also
posed
as
a
in
times
of
peace
i
was
in
antwerp
under
villat
said
rapper
fierce
little
man
he
was
he
used
to
come
and
correct
our
canvases
with
big
blotches
of
burnt
sienna
and
on
the
last
day
of
a
model
rocks
would
call
that
a
blottesque
effect
now
i
flatter
myself
can
tell
you
what
style
is
though
i
profess
to
get
it
myself
style
is
art
of
leaving
in
or
leaving
out
accidents
finished
rocks
see
that
so
well
in
gets
his
effects
by
leaving
out
all
the
dead
lines
of
his

the
journalist
you
jimmy
told
said
jimmy
the
art
of
leaving
out
said
herbert
leave
out
the
pictures
in
the
academy
hence
the
absence
of
style
in
the
tut
tut
shop
again
cried
cornpepper
despairingly
only
chance
of
progress
for
art
is
in
neglecting
values
not
from
ignorance
like
the
germans
but
from
intention
not
viewing
nature
through
a
bit
of
black
glass
like
millet
or
toning
down
the
violets
of
her
shadows
but
painting
real
you
really
paint
sunlight
put
in
matt
timidly
only
so
said
cornpepper
delacroix
said
me
mud
and
paint
you
the
skin
of
it
depends
on
what
you
put
round
your
how
you
put
it
on
added
gurney
only
way
is
to
get
optics
to
help
you
and
mix
your
primaries
on
the
canvas
not
on
the
palette
with
a
reckon
be
breaking
out
in
next
laughed
rocks
nonsense
has
been
the
ruin
of
young
dircks
he
used
to
be
quite
but
since
he
crossed
the
channel
he
squeezes
his
tubes
on
to
his
canvas
and
all
streaks
like
a
is
neither
mud
nor
sunlight
interposed
butler
authoritatively
paint
glory
in
it
pretend
silk
or
wood
according
to
the
academy
the
highest
art
is
to
conceal
again
groaned
cornpepper
an
awfully
narrow
set
we
artists
always
girding
at
each
methods
though
all
trying
for
the
same
then
recalled
by
frowning
face
to
a
sense
of
his
position
as
a
position
he
was
not
yet
prepared
to
abdicate
he
added
in
more
conciliatory
accents
i
object
to
in
the
academy
is
its
existence
no
body
of
men
has
the
right
to
say
to
the
public
i
for
a
moment
claim
our
better
than
theirs
only
theirs
is
worse
than
ours
suggested
jimmy
all
very
well
but
their
ideal
is
smooth
things
persisted
butler
vehemently
things
in
paint
in
life
and
in
speeches
i
should
have
taken
the
gold
medal
in
my
year
and
been
spared
years
of
grinding
misery
if
i
had
scraped
out
the
life
with
a
or
a
eyes
flashed
sympathetic
admiration
at
him
the
academy
said
herbert
hastily
me
the
of
arts
are
barracks
went
on
butler
his
resentment
unexhausted
would
fuse
all
talents
in
one
mould
and
put
together
what
god
has
put
asunder
you
may
teach
craft
but
art
never
idea
of
setting
a
subject
too
said
greme
who
was
very
proud
of
his
private
go
on
a
false
analogy
art
be
got
at
by
a
competitive
examination
it
like
latin
or
greek
or
the
use
of
the
globes
the
expression
of
individual
temperament
and
always
such
a
rotten
stilted
subject
they
set
for
the
gold
medal
i
wonder
what
it
is
this
year
at
the
academy
said
rapper
tell
confound
the
academy
said
herbert
crossly
biblical
you
bet
your
boots
said
jimmy
makes
the
fellows
read
the
bible
anyhow
but
i
must
really
go
and
meet
my
heard
it
was
about
nebu
greme
began
shut
up
greme
interrupted
herbert
it
time
to
sing
songs
he
glanced
anxiously
at
his
cousin
but
that
enthusiastic
young
man
was
gazing
at
butler
with
a
hypnotized
stare
lost
in
an
inward
vision
of
the
youthful
rebel
painting
in
his
time
to
drop
shop
responded
cornpepper
sharply
been
trying
to
get
the
talk
off
art
for
the
last
i
want
to
discuss
whiskey
woman
and
song
the
difference
who
wins
the
gold
medal
or
even
the
prix
de
rome
the
last
one
ever
hears
of
no
said
rapper
the
professors
at
the
took
the
prix
de
the
men
with
guts
inquired
cornpepper
scathingly
as
he
glared
through
his
monocle
at
his
contradictor
the
biggest
of
all
puvis
de
chavannes
now
you
fellows
define
style
but
it
never
occurs
to
you
that
it
is
simply
the
perfect
handling
of
your
medium
whatever
it
be
what
makes
the
decorations
of
puvis
de
chavannes
so
great
merely
that
the
gray
cool
color
scheme
just
suits
the
stone
of
the
pantheon
the
decorations
of
laurens
would
be
finer
as
easel
pictures
they
make
the
building
look
smaller
those
of
chavannes
ennoble
it
give
the
sense
of
space
and
atmosphere
the
medium
forced
to
yield
its
best
that
is
style
there
is
one
glory
of
and
another
of
chalk
or
pencil
pictures
are
damn
bad
because
they
are
in
the
wrong
medium
to
preserve
a
chronicle
of
the
time
is
the
function
of
black
and
white
only
by
really
must
go
said
jimmy
starting
up
again
a
man
i
preserve
a
chronicle
of
the
time
and
it
tells
me
a
ten
and
i
have
got
to
meet
my
wife
at
the
monico
at
rot
lots
of
and
a
dozen
hands
pushed
jimmy
into
his
seat
and
carrie
brought
him
more
whiskey
never
could
see
how
you
square
that
with
your
principles
cornpepper
argued
gurney
the
gyrator
with
a
thoughtful
wrinkle
of
his
elderly
face
got
to
do
his
own
time
posterity
want
greek
gods
with
flesh
and
sickly
with
wooden
limbs
a
head
well
painted
is
better
than
a
had
been
his
last
idolized
master
before
he
came
to
worship
at
the
shrine
of
cornpepper
imagination
in
matt
protested
deferentially
gurney
snorted
out
quintessence
of
contempt
in
an
indecorous
monosyllable
and
the
modern
duty
to
posterity
and
his
duty
to
his
contemporaries
is
to
find
the
poetry
and
beauty
around
and
teach
to
see
it
why
your
on
fire
in
fitzroy
is
the
picture
of
the
yes
matt
burst
forth
in
the
idiom
of
jolly
stunning
cornpepper
made
a
of
disgust
we
never
going
to
get
away
from
shop
he
asked
desperately
has
my
chimney
to
do
with
the
chronicles
of
the
time
you
chaps
have
always
misunderstood
me
you
all
go
by
what
writes
of
me
in
the
i
do
wish
he
interpret
me
i
wish
leave
me
alone
bad
enough
to
have
the
papers
writing
about
sayings
and
doings
bad
enough
to
be
afraid
of
your
own
friends
when
like
levison
and
wilfred
smith
they
happen
to
be
journalists
but
to
be
interpreted
in
leading
articles
by
is
the
crowning
blow
what
right
has
he
to
meddle
with
art
why
the
hell
he
stick
to
his
last
if
i
painted
that
chimney
of
sweeping
it
murmured
jimmy
let
me
go
and
meet
my
it
was
because
i
saw
an
opportunity
for
style
and
for
giving
an
epic
sense
of
london
little
cornpepper
went
on
fixing
jimmy
with
his
basilisk
glare
care
a
twopenny
damn
about
posterity
or
my
contemporaries
i
paint
as
i
do
everything
else
to
please
know
you
please
anybody
else
retorted
jimmy
be
black
and
white
is
going
to
be
the
art
of
the
future
anyhow
said
butler
is
dead
in
england
nobody
disputes
course
not
said
cornpepper
a
lost
art
not
one
of
us
can
touch
the
old
men
watts
millais
whistler
no
we
none
of
us
can
english
revive
through
black
and
white
butler
maintained
the
art
of
the
people
i
wish
i
had
discovered
that
in
the
days
when
i
refused
to
do
and
white
is
not
the
art
of
the
future
but
the
future
of
art
said
herbert
else
surer
than
anything
else
admitted
gurney
a
paper
gives
you
a
far
wider
appeal
than
a
gallery
the
only
way
of
elevating
the
his
eye
lit
up
he
was
meditating
a
new
departure
matt
pricked
up
his
ears
herbert
had
not
yet
repaid
him
the
pounds
borrowed
for
a
day
or
two
and
in
any
case
he
felt
he
must
soon
be
earning
money
in
the
stagnation
of
the
picture
market
of
which
he
heard
on
every
side
and
on
which
the
talk
fell
now
it
was
at
once
comforting
and
distressing
to
hear
of
another
source
of
income
black
and
white
had
scarcely
entered
into
his
thoughts
before
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
degraded
commercial
form
of
art
a
thing
manufactured
for
the
moment
in
obedience
to
editorial
instructions
perhaps
if
times
had
changed
if
editors
allowed
the
artist
to
express
himself
through
their
pages
one
might
think
of
it
otherwise
it
was
too
horrible
art
to
order
the
spirit
whose
essence
was
freedom
chained
to
a
it
were
as
well
and
honester
to
be
a
cobbler
like
william
gregson
he
shuddered
violently
remembering
his
sufferings
as
a
in
nova
scotia
and
very
resolved
to
starve
sooner
than
repeat
those
degrading
efforts
to
please
customers
talk
about
it
said
cornpepper
after
ten
minutes
of
general
tragic
anecdotage
from
which
he
gathered
there
was
quite
a
rush
into
black
and
white
a
subject
concerning
which
both
the
journalists
seemed
fully
posted
just
go
on
working
i
care
whether
i
sell
or
not
the
dealers
i
hate
and
despise
they
have
no
measure
of
art
but
what
fetch
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
the
world
will
come
to
me
sooner
or
later
you
never
hear
grumbling
about
the
more
i
hear
of
the
troubles
of
you
chaps
said
rapper
more
surprised
i
am
that
i
with
nothing
like
your
talents
should
be
the
one
to
get
the
commissions
as
if
i
had
any
need
of
the
shiners
going
to
birmingham
again
next
week
to
do
a
municipal
duffer
in
his
robes
even
when
i
studied

in
brussels
real

coming
to
black

that
all
born
the
dulness
of
our
surroundings
the
long
centuries
of
homes
without
decorations
with
unbeautiful
furniture
and
crockery
have
told
and
now
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
that
mack
cried
rapper
keep
mack
off
shop
cried
cornpepper
sick
of
this
talk
about
principles

the

for
what

groaned
jimmy
trying
to
shake
off
the
detaining
hands
of
his
friends
sandstone
why
he
turned
up
he
goes
my
know
said
cornpepper
been
quarrelling
with
the
man
who
published
his
lithographs
what
a
quarrelsome
beggar
he
is
i
believe
quarrelled
with
clinch
now
where
clinch
he
said
he
was
everybody
supposed
simultaneously
that
clinch
was
drunk
and
their
acceptance
of
the
idea
jarred
upon
matt
who
again
became
conscious
of
a
curious
aloofness
from
the
company
from
which
he
seemed
as
cut
off
on
the
moral
side
as
from
the
despised
bourgeoisie
on
the
artistic
side
what
a
strange
isolation
the
thought
made
him
feel
lonely
and
then
by
reaction
strong
even
rocks
laughed
prefer
philip
drunk
to
philip
sober
he
said
the
only
time
he
uses
can
i
sup
with
my
wife
at
the
monico

jimmy
plaintively
beastly
place

on

said
herbert
can
you
have
art
and
the
english
sunday
together
you
talk
of
the
art
of
the
people
curtis
the
real
national
art
of
england
is
oratorio
and
elijah
may
not
appear
on
the
stage
except
in
evening
talk
to
me
of
the

groaned
cornpepper

said
butler
be
moral
some
can
get
my
stockings
darned
without
marrying
retorted
cornpepper
with
an
irritating
laugh
and
butler
reddened
angrily
he
had
married
a
slipshod
artistic
creature
who
neglected
his
and
the
thrust
rankled
waiting
at
the
monico
complained
jimmy
in
a
droll
bother
just
making
the
coffee
replied
the
host
have
coffee
said
jimmy
never
mix
the
coffee
came
round
and
with
it
sandwiches
and
broke
up
the
talk
into
duets
and
trios
cornpepper
planned
a
party
for
the
summer
to
pick
up
nautical
models
and
paint
the
river
envious
consciousness
that
he
was
too
poor
and
too
obscure
to
share
in
these
delightful
artistic
experiences
gave
him
a
new
and
more
disagreeable
sense
of
aloofness
then
the
proceedings
became
musical
and
remained
so
till
the
next
morning
their
refusal
to
depart
before
the
advent
of
which
the
guests
melodiously
declared
as
the
party
was
breaking
up

cried
i
was
nearly

jimmy

a
prayer
to
take
up
a
collection
retorted
cornpepper
his
gleaming
with
joy
of
the
broken
her
lily
asked
greme
she
sit
now
on
the
know
dislocated
her
ankle
and
never
could
dance
observed
herbert
ever
did
she
get
an
engagement
put
her
into
his
types
of
english
beauty
replied
cornpepper
a
good
girl
all
the
same
and
she
got
any
money
lead
off
with
five
in
a
few
minutes
two
guineas
were
collected
matt
giving
half
a
crown
which
he
could
ill
spare
as
the
men
left
cornpepper
stood
at
the
door
exchanging
a
confidential
word
with
each
jove
you
say
a
word
during
the
whole
discussion
mossop
he
said
as
he
shook
hands
with
a
scotchman
whose
cranium
bulged
curiously
at
the
side
mossop
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
looked
meditatively
at
the
stem
art
could
be
talked
it
want
to
be
painted
he
said
gravely
old
chap
ah
wilfred
said
cornpepper
to
the
journalist
this
evening
is
private
i
object
to
your
quoting
what
i
or
anybody
else
said
my
opinions
are
common
property
but
damn
it
if
you
mention
who
were
here
in
any
of
your
papers
never
cross
my
again
you
mind
my
frankness
old
cornpepper
said
herbert
let
the
governor
know
about
those
things
of
yours
he
added
in
a
low
tone
a
good
fellow
he
regret
taking
me
up
mind
you
mention
not
unreasonable
open
to
an
offer
awfully
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
old
chap
ah
levison
he
said
shaking
hands
with
the
other
journalist
please
do
understand
that
what
passes
at
my
gatherings
is
strictly
confidential
if
you
can
earn
half
a
dollar
by
mentioning
who
were
here
rocks
is
rather
a
lion
just
now
not
the
man
to
stand
in
your
light
but
i
have
what
one
says
in
private
reported
and
straight
old
two
boomed
from
a
neighboring
steeple
teddy
said
jimmy
the
last
man
to
go
he
added
lugubriously
got
to
meet
my
then
as
he
caught
sight
of
himself
in
the
mirror
the
gleam
in
his
eye
grew
droller
going
home
in
my
own
hat
and
coat
he
grumbled
it
was
delicious
to
breathe
the
balmy
night
air
after
the
smoky
alcoholic
atmosphere
of
the
studio
rocks
walked
a
little
way
with
herbert
and
matt
under
the
silent
stars
before
they
came
upon
a
hansom
you
also
an
artist
he
asked
matt
hope
to
be
said
matt
gravely
awfully
confusing
to
know
right
they
all
talk
so
cleverly
and
they
all
seem
to
be
he
was
still
worried
about
formulæ
not
having
discovered
that
there
are
only
men
rocks
emitted
a
short
laugh
you
bother
your
head
with
theories
my
boy
he
said
laying
his
hand
kindly
on
shoulder
just
paint
every
man
does
what
he
can
and
runs
down
what
he
after
all
art
is
very
old
there
are
no
great
sensational
reforms
left
like
discarding
the
toga
for
the
clothes
of
the
period
the
school
is
this
contribution
after
that
there
can
only
be
permutations
and
combinations
of
the
old
what
is
new
in
the
azure
art
gallery
is
not
good
and
what
is
good
is
not
fini
said
herbert
what
people
always
say
till
genius
comes
along
my
belief
is
going
by
literature
and
music
that
painting
said
its
last
may
come
back
to
its
first
admitted
rocks
laughing
go
in
cycles
at
present
the
last
word
of
art
is
there
azure
shadows
said
matt
sunshine
on
a
yellow
sand
gives
a
suspicion
of
blue
and
violet
where
the
yellow
light
is
cut
off
but
you
exaggerate
it
and
call
that
a
but
this
intensified
violet
made
on
your
canvas
out
of
light
pigments
does
produce
the
illusion
of
sunlight
argued
matt
to
my
mind
it
falsify
nature
or
values
one
bit
because
in
bright
sunlight
the
eye
really
sees
the
dazzle
not
the
you
young
men
see
the
new
at
the
end
of
the
spectrum
said
rocks
a
little
annoyed
to
find
matt
restive
under
his
patronizing
geniality
had
only
four
colors
but
his
reputation
has
survived
it
is
the
craze
for
novelty
that
makes
these
fads
catch
the
contrary
retorted
matt
hotly
are
so
accustomed
to
the
false
they
have
no
eyes
for
the
true
the
old
fable
of
the
man
with
the
pig
under
his
cloak
i
read
somewhere
that
in
sir
day
it
was
the
convention
to
paint
portraits
with
hats
under
their
arm
and
that
sir
joshua
having
to
paint
a
man
with
his
hat
on
automatically
put
a
second
hat
under
his
arm
if
he
found
it
out
i
believe
the
public
would
have
and
the
men
laughed
at
in
france
though
now
thrown
in
the
teeth
of
the
impressionists
always
the
same
tale
the
revolutionary
is
always
wrong
till
right
treason
never
prospers
the
reason
when
successful
no
longer
truth
and
light
the
right
formula
of
herbert
laughed
stars
matt
he
cried
gayly
the
longest
speech
ever
heard
you
make
is
whiskey
so
much
better
than
mine
it
was
perhaps
not
so
much
the
whiskey
as
the
reaction
after
the
long
respectful
of
the
evening
but
rocks
caught
fire
in
his
turn
he
cried
scornfully
things
literally
by
halves
a
revolution
a
revelation
for
you
the
new
art
if
the
modern
young
man
draw
the
thing
and
if
got
no
sense
of
color
color
is
vulgar
and
even
if
he
offend
my
sense
of
line
by
figures
that
stand
and
limbs
that
fit
on
he
finish
his
work
he
leaves
it
to
show
his
to
take
it
further
would
be
academic
mere
notes
for
pictures
not
pictures
and
even
at
that
half
the
ideas
come
from
paris
like
our
gowns
if
you
ran
over
there
as
often
as
i
do
you
could
put
your
finger
on
most
of
these
azure
inspirations
if
they
would
only
search
like
the
french
if
they
would
only
really
imitate
their
monet
a
real
worker
for
you
how
he
slaves
at
his
more
science
than
art
to
my
thinking
but
how
he
searches
these
chaps
are
such
dwarfs
think
of
leonardo
think
of
raphael
think
of
millet
real
men
with
big
brains
and
big
souls
no
this
azure
art
a
set
of
bounders
and
bad
draughtsmen
too
much
mutual
admiration
it
prevents
men
getting
on
find
themselves
stranded
with
a
butler
got
a
big
soul
cried
matt
boiling
over
cornpepper
got
a
big
brain
oh
but
this
is
shop
again
a
good
little
chap
at
bottom
but
succeeding
too
and
in
hearty
guffaw
the
rolled
away
fancy
i
agree
with
him
altogether
rocks
said
matt
simmering
down
in
his
turn
the
morality
of
art
now
there
the
methodist
parson
again
interrupted
herbert
laughing
it
all
man
not
a
virgin
are
you
of
course
not
faltered
matt
mendaciously
he
went
on
in
haste
a
cab
i
hate
said
herbert
why
the
devil
do
you
always
talk
such
rot
hansom
seem
as
united
as
the
papers
make
out
anyway
said
matt
in
evasion
he
was
ashamed
of
the
lie
and
ashamed
of
its
not
being
true
no
de
among
artists
returned
rocks
always
imagine
there
are
schools
but
in
london
only
the
camaraderie
of
success
and
the
camaraderie
of
unsuccess
we
give
you
a
lift
said
herbert
thanks
successful
rejoined
rocks
and
went
off
chuckling
wish
was
herbert
grumbled
to
matt
not
being
able
to
join
that
party
but
to
be
stuck
down
in
town
by
the
old
gentleman
to
paint
nebuchadnezzar
i
wish
i
was
you
matt
was
on
the
point
of
consoling
him
by
confessing
he
was
on
the
brink
of
ruin
but
that
would
have
seemed
like
dunning
a
friend
to
whom
he
owed
so
much
for
the
pounds
so
he
postponed
the
inevitable
explanation
chapter
vi
the
outcast
it
was
midsummer
and
everybody
who
was
anybody
was
pent
in
the
sweltering
city
sort
of
weather
to
make
one
want
to
be
a
herbert
said
wearily
as
he
flicked
finically
at
before
nebuchadnezzar
now
well
on
its
way
to
completion
it
seems
to
suit
the
old
gentleman
you
might
laugh
matt
too
languid
matt
did
not
reply
he
was
leaning
against
the
marble
pale
and
perspiring
do
you
think
is
his
latest
move
pursued
herbert
rather
a
bull
for
the
mischief
is
that
he
refuses
to
go
on
our
annual
autumn
jaunt
abroad
lest
it
should
interfere
with
daniel
and
nebby
however
i
am
to
have
a
horse
of
my
own
and
some
consolation
talking
of
horses
how
do
you
like
left
leg
you
see
repainted
it
as
you
marked
he
got
up
walked
backward
and
surveyed
the
picture
approvingly
brush
in
hand
jove
coming
on
splendidly
i
could
imagine
i
was
in
the
palace
there
something
in
following
nature
after
all
the
creative
part
lies
in
the
invention
and
color
the
matter
with
you
this
morning
matt
you
say
a
word
are
you
sunstruck
or
moonstruck
said
matt
with
a
ghastly
smile
up
herbert
scrutinized
his
face
for
the
first
time
matt
looked
towards
the
model
know
his
english
is
limited
herbert
remarked
reassuringly
you
are
bent
on
talking
but
matt
still
hesitated
at
last
as
in
desperation
he
extracted
a
letter
from
his
and
tendered
it
to
herbert
who
took
it
wonderingly
cast
a
glance
at
it
and
frowned
scoundrel
he
said
dare
he
send
it
in
so
soon
i
shall
never
recommend
him
to
anybody
soon
corrected
matt
more
than
three
not
going
to
take
any
notice
of
him
yet
i
nonsense
why
the
shock
would
drive
him
silly
he
only
sends
it
in
as
a
matter
of
like
not
to
right
said
herbert
sulkily
spoil
the
market
for
us
poor
devils
not
crœsuses
all
but
give
him
the
fifteen
guineas
at
once
give
him
five
on
matt
struggled
with
himself
even
do
that
he
faltered
at
last
you
can
manage
to
pay
me
by
jove
said
herbert
whistling
lugubriously
forgotten
you
were
among
my
creditors
but
just
now
so
the
old
scoundrel
will
have
to
wait
after
all
ha
ha
ha
when
do
you
expect
to
be
flush
again
i
suppose
you
draw
interest
on
bonds
or
something
all
americans
i
said
matt
his
head
drooping
then
with
the
courage
of
despair
he
burst
out
only
got
tenpence
in
the
world
a
herbert
gave
a
shrill
whistle
of
surprise
and
dismay
and
let
himself
drop
upon
his
go
and
play
a
little
haroun
al
raschid
he
called
over
to
the
model
and
nebuchadnezzar
shedding
his
purpureal
splendors
cantered
joyously
then
he
said
sternly
in
the
devil
have
you
been
up
to
my
methodist
parson
gambling
women
matt
shook
his
head
a
wan
smile
struggling
with
his
expression
he
already
felt
happier
the
false
atmosphere
in
which
he
had
moved
was
dissipated
forever
never
had
any
money
to
lose
he
confessed
only
saved
up
fifty
or
sixty
pounds
to
study
in
london
for
a
year
and
now
all
gone
unless
you
can
manage
to
repay
me
the
of
all
the
cried
herbert
and
did
not
finish
the
mysterious
phrase
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
supporting
his
face
upon
his
palms
stared
severely
at
his
cousin
this
is
the
man
who
thinks
art
should
be
moral
he
said
half
musingly
half
indignantly
go
and
let
us
all
think
you
were
a
capitalist
and
to
let
me
in
for
borrowing
money
of
a
man
who
was
practically
a
pauper
why
i
must
have
taken
almost
your
last
penny
matt
flushing
afresh
under
his
reproachful
gaze
did
not
attempt
to
deny
it
if
your
idea
of
cousinly
behavior
or
even
decent
behavior
said
herbert
witheringly
i
mean
to
deceive
you
matt
stammered
apologetically
all
took
it
for
granted
i
was
all
i
said
was
i
had
money
enough
to
go
along
with
and
so
i
thought
i
but
when
i
asked
you
for
the
pony
you
consented
at
once
i
gave
you
an
opportunity
to
explain
but
instead
of
that
you
intensified
the
original
false
matt
was
silent
now
put
me
into
the
wretched
position
of
owing
money
which
i
pay
to
a
poor
relation
from
whom
i
never
would
have
borrowed
it
had
he
been
frank
and
now
both
were
silent
meditating
the
painful
situation
got
no
money
at
all
said
herbert
at
last
in
stern
accents
in
which
a
note
of
astonishment
still
lingered
matt
shook
his
head
his
throat
felt
parched
you
can
pay
me
he
murmured
face
softened
his
tones
became
sympathetic
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
anxiously
matt
was
touched
by
the
transition
from
reproach
to
solicitude
i
shall
manage
somehow
he
said
huskily
want
to
worry
you
always
been
very
good
to
all
very
well
but
suppose
you
starve
said
herbert
sharply
i
shall
find
something
to
do
said
matt
fact
already
done
some
illustrations
for
the
though
they
paid
yet
i
have
told
you
if
it
been
for
this
him
cried
herbert
savagely
never
recommend
him
another
customer
as
long
as
i
he
started
promenading
the
studio
angrily
muttering
maledictions
against
the
snip
as
the
source
of
all
the
mischief
a
pity
the
governor
touch
a
new
work
he
said
pausing
rather
not
trouble
him
said
matt
shrinking
from
a
supplementary
explanation
with
the
vandyke
beard
herbert
resumed
his
promenade
with
knitted
brow
wonder
if
drücker
would
take
them
if
you
did
please
worry
pleaded
matt
concerned
at
his
anxiety
dare
say
i
shall
fall
on
my
but
while
falling
tenpence
enough
to
fall
with
you
owe
any
money
into
the
bargain
i
matt
turned
red
rent
he
murmured
much
is
that
matt
shrank
weakly
from
shredding
his
last
rag
of
dignity
much
he
said
said
anything
yet
i
always
paid
her
so
regularly
but
i
see
any
reason
to
despair
it
looks
as
if
i
can
make
my
bread
and
cheese
by
black
and
white
they
were
all
agreed
that
that
was
the
most
paying
kind
of
art
you
remember
that
night
at
i
remember
said
herbert
curtly
i
let
you
go
away
with
tenpence
in
your
pocket
i
wonder
if
got
he
drew
a
handful
of
silver
and
copper
coins
out
of
his
and
fourpence
halfpenny
he
announced
dolefully
i
shall
want
seven
for
haroun
al
raschid
this
evening
i
told
you
i
was
i
suppose
no
use
offering
you
one
and
fourpence
then
have
nothing
said
matt
but
i
must
bother
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
raise
a
little
cash
for
you
to
keep
you
going
till
you
get
the
grave
anxiety
of
his
tones
troubled
matt
sympathetically
he
was
pained
to
see
herbert
so
distressed
suddenly
his
eyes
fell
on
battalion
of
boots
ranged
against
the
wall
brown
boots
black
boots
patent
boots
riding
boots
shoes
slippers
and
a
wild
impish
idea
flew
into
his
brain
breathing
malicious
suggestion
and
even
kindling
a
flash
of
resentment
should
not
herbert
sell
some
of
those
serried
boots
if
he
was
really
in
earnest
but
the
impish
idea
was
extruded
in
a
moment
it
savored
of
ungenerous
cynicism
and
in
so
far
as
it
meditated
diminishing
wardrobe
touched
indecency
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
herbert
with
only
a
single
pair
of
breeches
or
without
of
ornamental
shoes
he
moved
in
a
large
atmosphere
of
discriminate
waistcoats
and
superfluous
neckties
give
you
an
introduction
to
drücker
if
you
like
said
herbert
dare
say
you
have
some
little
things
by
already
been
to
drücker
matt
admitted
fellow
at
told
me
about
him
but
he
look
at
my
there
was
another
embarrassing
pause
eyes
wandered
distractedly
towards
boots
the
spotless
battalion
fascinated
him
the
buttons
winked
maliciously
about
portraits
said
herbert
suddenly
thought
you
did
portraits
in
nova
scotia
was
that
also
was
that
er
true
matt
did
not
at
once
answer
it
had
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
probably
another
battalion
of
boots
in
when
question
at
last
penetrated
to
his
consciousness
he
replied
with
a
start
yes
perhaps
i
may
get
sitters
here
too
the
only
thing
that
really
worries
me
is
that
well
if
all
you
can
make
your
mind
easy
he
touch
you
no
herbert
laughed
gleefully
serve
him
right
the
scoundrel
he
can
put
me
in
prison
said
matt
blanching
at
the
mere
idea
that
i
could
never
laugh
became
more
boisterous
you
innocent
he
gasped
not
living
in
the
dark
ages
a
man
without
a
farthing
is
the
king
of
creation
nothing
can
touch
but
they
put
people
in
prison
for
debt
in
nova
scotia
said
matt
surprised
ejaculated
herbert
surprised
in
his
turn
i
had
no
idea
the
country
was
so
uncivilized
as
that
no
funk
and
even
suppose
you
put
into
quod
for
debt
what
then
why
debt
is
the
breath
of
the
artistic
nostril
read
your
bankruptcy
court
daily
in
your
paper
and
cheer
up
hear
why
should
you
take
other
worries
on
your
shoulders
quoth
matt
puzzled
the
worry
is
for
the
tailor
who
get
his
money
not
for
you
explained
herbert
with
the
gay
smile
that
showed
his
white
teeth
pay
him
matt
repeated
stolidly
and
lunch
coming
up
he
took
himself
off
in
spite
of
every
protest
now
that
herbert
knew
him
in
his
true
colors
his
pride
would
not
endure
sitting
as
a
pauper
at
the
banquet
though
he
had
eaten
nothing
all
day
except
a
halfpenny
roll
he
saw
haroun
al
raschid
in
the
street
luxuriating
in
the
sultry
sunshine
and
sent
him
up
to
luncheon
then
dragged
himself
along
the
hot
pavements
to
his
back
room
brightened
now
with
unsaleable
sketches
and
threw
himself
upon
the
little
iron
bed
and
abandoned
himself
to
bitter
reflection
why
indeed
could
he
not
take
life
as
lightly
as
the
artistic
temperament
demanded
he
had
already
tried
other
dealers
than
drücker
with
as
little
success
the
irishman
at
was
wont
to
boast
that
he
always
sold
his
work
by
pawning
it
matt
had
essayed
to
imitate
him
speculating
the
outlay
for
a
gold
frame
but
either
his
face
betrayed
him
to
the
pawnbrokers
or
his
picture
and
it
eventually
went
for
less
than
the
price
of
the
frame
and
o
vanity
of
resolutions
and
ideals
his
horror
at
doing
art
to
order
had
dwindled
daily
in
the
actual
imminence
of
starvation
in
the
impossibility
of
sending
any
further
subsidies
to
his
family
he
had
broached
to
other
students
his
desire
to
get
on
this
or
that
paper
but
could
gain
no
sympathetic
information
from
them
except
that
they
had
already
refused
the
positions
he
coveted
on
the
strength
of
some
specimens
sent
by
post
he
had
been
permitted
to
illustrate
five
short
stories
for
the
but
only
two
had
yet
been
published
and
none
had
yet
been
paid
for
and
so
the
dregs
of
his
savings
had
dripped
away
slowly
slowly
like
honey
from
an
inverted
pot
more
and
more
slowly
the
less
there
remained
till
only
twenty
drops
for
he
had
come
down
to
counting
in
halfpennies
divided
him
from
starvation
the
arrears
of
rent
had
been
an
agony
more
gnawing
than
that
at
his
stomach
and
now
this
bill
had
come
as
the
crowning
catastrophe
yet
none
of
his
bitterness
was
for
herbert
despite
the
impish
suggestions
of
the
buttons
he
did
not
even
blame
himself
much
in
a
sense
he
had
had
value
for
his
money
he
had
bought
experience
if
not
quite
of
the
kind
for
which
he
had
saved
up
his
dollars
but
for
those
frightful
fifteen
guineas
he
might
have
weathered
even
though
by
the
practice
of
a
form
of
art
he
had
not
contemplated
to
pawn
or
sell
the
unfortunate
clothes
would
be
but
to
cut
himself
off
from
gentility
without
surmounting
the
crisis
his
hopeless
reverie
was
interrupted
by
a
tap
at
the
door
and
the
landlady
entered
bearing
a
letter
he
jumped
up
from
the
bed
in
excitement
it
must
be
his
check
for
the
drawings
but
the
letter
bore
an
american
stamp
and
was
in
writing
and
he
tore
it
open
fearful
of
new
evils
dear
matt
i
write
not
because
there
is
anything
fresh
but
because
there
life
here
is
so
dreary
and
monotonous
i
can
no
longer
endure
it
it
my
health
for
that
is
better
and
the
fits
are
very
rare
now
thank
god
but
sometimes
i
think
i
shall
go
mad
or
cut
my
throat
if
something
happen
you
think
i
could
come
over
and
stay
with
you
seen
so
much
of
the
world
and
always
enjoyed
yourself
and
i
have
always
been
tied
down
to
one
wretched
little
village
the
people
are
so
dismally
religious
and
between
you
and
me
i
am
losing
faith
in
everything
the
more
i
think
of
it
and
how
bad
the
good
people
are
deacon
hailey
and
ruth
have
quarrelled
and
she
has
gone
away
to
the
states
she
came
to
see
us
before
she
left
she
is
just
lovely
i
like
to
picture
her
before
me
i
should
not
be
much
extra
expense
dear
matt
because
you
could
deduct
something
from
the
amount
you
are
soon
going
to
send
us
monthly
i
have
mentioned
this
to
abner
and
he
is
willing
i
am
very
little
use
here
in
the
fields
and
in
london
i
might
perhaps
earn
money
by
writing
i
feel
i
have
it
in
me
to
write
tales
i
have
already
written
one
called
whale
hunters
and
another
called
the
burning
i
do
so
long
to
be
famous
we
should
be
a
pair
dear
matt
do
you
think
you
could
get
these
tales
printed
in
a
paper
i
should
not
want
money
at
first
i
did
not
like
to
send
them
to
you
without
asking
as
the
postage
would
be
heavy
and
the
winter
has
been
so
unusually
protracted
we
are
delayed
with
the
crops
do
please
send
me
some
books
if
you
can
i
have
read
everything
in
the
school
library
twice
over
novels
and
books
of
travel
are
what
i
like
best
the
last
we
heard
from
halifax
was
that
mother
was
less
violent
do
write
and
say
i
may
come
and
if
you
can
let
me
have
the
fare
i
will
repay
you
out
of
my
tales
abner
and
harriet
send
their
love
and
so
do
all
the
boys
and
girls
amy
is
getting
quite
podgy
and
with
the
same
from
me
i
remain
your
affectionate
brother
billy
you
think
would
look
fine
on
the
cover
of
a
book
matt
suddenly
felt
faint
and
dizzy
raising
his
eyes
he
perceived
that
the
landlady
had
not
gone
that
she
was
effervescing
with
unuttered
speech
am
very
sorry
lipchild
he
said
thought
that
your
rent
would
have
been
in
this
the
lank
elderly
woman
looked
grieved
bless
you
sir
said
she
not
about
the
rent
i
know
an
honest
face
when
i
see
it
us
landladies
are
always
made
out
so
bad
always
the
provisions
and
what
not
and
we
speak
proper
i
should
like
to
see
a
book
written
on
the
other
side
why
last
year
i
had
an
old
maid
in
this
very
room
she
took
her
meals
here
and
said
i
to
charge
for
attendance
because
be
always
out
but
bless
me
if
the
bell
go
every
minute
like
an
gone
wrong
in
its
inside
believe
me
strang
it
the
lodgers
as
is
always
taken
in
often
wished
my
son
was
a
writer
instead
of
an
artist
get
him
to
write
the
son
is
an
artist
said
matt
in
astonishment
strang
though
not
near
so
clever
as
you
i
could
show
you
some
of
his
work
if
you
i
should
like
to
see
it
said
matt
half
amused
at
this
unexpected
interlude
though
his
temples
throbbed
with
a
shooting
pain
you
mind
down
into
the
parlor
sir
pleasure
said
matt
he
followed
his
landlady
down
the
narrow
stairs
into
the
musty
little
room
resplendent
with
oleographs
and
a
gilt
mirror
and
two
said
lipchild
proudly
and
my
husband
in
matt
surveyed
the
large
colored
presentments
of
and
lipchild
in
their
oval
mounts
further
astonished
to
discover
that
his
landlord
was
a
policeman
did
he
do
them
with
asked
matt
rather
puzzled
his
own
hand
replied
the
proud
mother
were
taken
quite
plain
but
he
colored
them
lifelike
as
you
see
they
would
have
charged
half
a
crown
more
each
but
for
a
shilling
he
bought
a
book
telling
him
how
to
do
it
himself
my
cousin
bob
who
is
in
the
said
he
ought
to
be
an
artist
but
i
let
him
give
up
his
place
at
brown
illustration
bless
you
sir
said
she
not
about
the
brothers
in
the
grocery
department
and
good
money
and
seen
such
a
heap
of
artists
on
the
pavement
with
the
risk
any
moment
of
the
rain
all
the
pictures
out
you
think
i
was
right
sir
right
said
matt
heartily
lipchild
thereupon
produced
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
what
she
called
a
from
a
cupboard
under
a
sideboard
and
insisted
on
partaking
of
the
same
to
refuse
would
pain
her
to
accept
would
refresh
him
so
he
accepted
in
the
conversation
which
ensued
it
transpired
that
daughter
was
about
to
marry
a
young
man
from
brown
brothers
haberdashery
department
that
the
young
couple
were
now
furnishing
and
that
it
had
occurred
to
lipchild
that
they
might
get
their
parlor
pictures
from
matt
instead
of
from
a
shop
if
they
could
get
them
any
cheaper
so
matt
and
his
art
patroness
remounted
again
to
the
bedroom
studio
and
haggled
over
prices
lipchild
pointing
out
that
his
pictures
were
far
inferior
to
shop
pictures
not
only
by
their
unsympathetic
subjects
but
by
their
absence
of
frames
and
glass
and
that
she
could
get
much
bigger
sizes
than
any
of
his
for
five
shillings
apiece
but
as
it
came
to
be
understood
that
ready
money
would
not
be
required
and
that
the
price
was
to
be
reckoned
off
the
rent
lipchild
ultimately
departed
in
possession
of
a
worth
of
pictures
six
of
the
prettiest
landscapes
and
ladies
in
the
collection
with
thrown
in
the
poetic
she
scorned
much
to
relief
for
he
set
no
value
on
the
earlier
nova
scotian
work
she
had
carried
off
this
was
first
sale
of
pictures
in
the
great
metropolis
of
art
considerably
exhilarated
by
the
change
in
his
fortunes
and
revived
by
the
brandy
and
the
he
reviewed
the
situation
again
proof
even
against
letter
which
he
put
by
for
later
consideration
he
found
himself
actually
smiling
for
a
phrase
of
kept
vibrating
in
his
brain
neither
moral
nor
immoral
any
more
than
lunar
or
last
words
had
been
well
reckon
it
a
month
and
he
wondered
whimsically
whether
the
month
was
to
be
lunar
or
calendar
under
the
impulse
of
these
gayer
sentiments
he
resolved
to
raise
money
by
pawning
whatever
he
could
part
with
and
by
persisting
in
the
search
for
an
adventurous
dealer
and
reflecting
that
after
all
the
tailor
would
be
satisfied
with
an
instalment
he
wound
himself
up
to
the
pitch
of
applying
to
herbert
by
letter
though
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
a
verbal
request
my
dear
herbert
i
am
sorry
to
bother
you
again
but
if
you
could
let
me
have
only
five
guineas
to
offer
the
tailor
i
should
be
very
grateful
i
hope
soon
to
find
work
or
sell
some
things
and
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
i
have
got
over
the
difficulty
with
the
rent
at
least
for
the
moment
yours
sincerely
matt
strang
put
yourself
out
if
you
can
not
you
have
been
very
kind
to
me
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
i
dare
say
i
shall
pull
through
matt
carried
this
request
to
the
through
the
stuffy
splendor
of
a
summer
night
in
holborn
back
streets
as
he
heard
the
slight
thud
of
the
letter
in
the
box
he
had
a
sense
of
something
achieved
and
had
no
compunction
in
spending
one
of
his
nine
remaining
pennies
on
his
supper
of
in
a
muggy
shop
nightmare
followed
by
a
giddy
uprising
with
furred
tongue
and
aching
forehead
was
the
sequel
of
this
diet
and
early
in
the
afternoon
the
nightmare
seemed
to
resume
its
riot
in
the
guise
of
a
reply
from
herbert
dear
matt
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
unholy
made
you
send
that
letter
to
my
house
instead
of
to
the
club
been
a
devil
of
a
row
the
old
gentleman
opened
the
letter
he
pretends
he
did
so
without
noticing
as
it
came
mixed
up
with
his
and
so
few
come
for
me
to
the
house
when
i
got
down
to
breakfast
the
mater
was
in
tears
and
the
old
gentleman
in
blazes
of
course
misread
it
altogether
imagined
you
wanted
to
borrow
money
instead
of
to
get
it
back
it
comical
almost
an
idea
for
a
farce
for
our
dramatic
society
and
insisted
you
had
been
draining
me
all
along
you
did
write
you
were
sorry
to
bother
me
again
you
old
duffer
of
course
i
did
my
best
to
dispel
the
misconception
but
it
was
no
use
my
swearing
till
all
was
blue
that
this
was
the
first
application
he
believe
a
word
of
it
he
said
he
had
had
his
suspicions
all
along
and
he
called
the
mater
to
witness
that
the
first
time
he
saw
you
in
the
shop
he
said
you
were
a
rogue
and
at
last
the
mater
been
standing
up
for
you
i
never
thought
she
had
so
much
backbone
of
her
own
was
converted
and
confessed
with
tears
that
you
had
been
here
pretty
nigh
every
day
and
swore
you
should
never
set
foot
here
again
and
the
old
gentleman
dilated
on
the
pretty
return
you
had
made
for
his
kindness
sucking
his
blood
he
called
it
in
an
unusual
burst
of
poetry
and
he
likewise
offered
some
general
observations
on
the
comparative
keenness
of
a
tooth
and
ingratitude
and
how
it
stands
nothing
to
be
done
i
fear
but
to
let
the
thing
blow
over
cool
down
after
a
time
meanwhile
you
will
have
to
write
to
me
at
the
club
if
you
want
to
meet
me
i
am
awfully
sorry
as
i
enjoyed
your
visits
immensely
do
let
me
know
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
in
a
frightful
financial
mess
but
i
might
give
you
introductions
here
or
there
i
know
chaps
on
papers
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
am
sure
you
have
sufficient
talent
to
get
along
and
you
can
snap
your
fingers
at
creditors
as
you
got
anything
they
can
seize
and
can
flit
any
day
you
like
i
wish
i
was
you
with
every
good
wish
yours
always
herbert
strang
matt
took
this
letter
more
stoically
than
he
would
have
predicted
he
even
grinned
like
a
red
indian
at
the
stake
in
truth
he
was
already
so
prostrated
by
illness
hunger
and
above
all
by
the
heat
that
there
was
nothing
left
in
him
to
be
prostrated
he
crawled
out
soon
after
the
receipt
of
the
letter
and
recklessly
bought
a
halfpenny
currant
loaf
which
he
washed
down
with
water
chapter
vii
towards
the
deeps
the
summer
rolled
heavily
along
bringing
strange
new
experiences
to
matt
strang
and
strange
glimpses
of
other
than

did
not
starve
though
herbert
had
gone
quite
out
of
his

he
had
none

to
exchange
the
thoughts
of
youth
two
pounds

shillings
lent
on
his
staved
off

and
his
tailor
who
got
the
pounds

by
the
aid
of
the
book
he
found
out
how
to
tint
photographs

earned
sixpences

him
to
its
hearth
situate
at
the
summit
of
a
cobwebbed
ramshackle
staircase
in
bolt
court
and
paid
him
seven
and
sixpence
for
a
illustration
of
an
unworldly
serial
was
a
delightful
weekly
emotion
the
staff
adjourning
to
a
in
fleet
street
to
drink
one
health
and
their
own
damnation
matt
was
forced
to
join
them
because
dick
gattel
the
author
of
the
spiritual
romance
he
was
illustrating
godly
insisted
on
standing
treat
declaring
with
odd
oaths
that
never
been
so
well
interpreted
before
by
any
blooming
he
also
initiated
matt
into
the
secrets
of
his
craft
summing
up
in
a
formula
the
experience
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
of
for
the
penny
papers
excitement
for
the
halfpenny
for
the
strange
impecunious
beings
gathered
in
this
or
outside
it
uncouth
unclean
unshaven
many
had
drifted
down
from
society
from
the
universities
from
the
army
from
the
navy
with
reserve
forces
from
india
and
america
the
flotsam
of
wreckage
and
they
consoled
themselves
by
babbling
of
the
seamy
side
of
the
successful
rolling
under
their
tongues
the
money
these
others
were
making
and
parading
a
confident
familiarity
with
their
doings
and
their
matt
shuddered
at
the
thought
that
he
might
one
day
become
even
as
these
the
there
was
another
artist
on
the
staff
a
german
whose
wife
was
wont
to
waylay
him
on
and
who
always
wrote
on
professional
paper
girdled
with
his
own
designs
in
proof
of
his
prowess
and
expressive
of
his
willingness
to
undertake
or
lithography
at
reasonable
rates
and
with
prompt
deliveries
through
this
german
who
was
after
his
second
glass
matt
procured
extra
employment
in
a
factory
managed
by
a
solemn
snuffy
scotchman
who
selected
from
old
comic
papers
the
jokes
that
were
to
be
illustrated
by
his
and
signing
the
sketches
with
his
own
name
peddled
them
in
the
offices
of
new
comic
papers
matt
was
paid
half
a
crown
per
sketch
and
his
employer
from
four
to
five
shillings
but
when
the
young
man
tried
to
send
original
jokes
and
sketches
direct
to
these
papers
he
got
only
the
same
two
and
sixpence
for
the
few
things
they
accepted
one
editor
whose
pages
bristled
with
took
the
trouble
to
explain
to
him
that
the
presence
of
a
clergyman
in
a
sketch
was
a
disqualification
as
any
attack
on
the
church
would
be
distasteful
to
his
public
from
another
the
whose
proprietor
was
a
philanthropist
a
member
of
the
school
board
and
a
candidate
for
parliament
he
received
a
prospectus
instructing
him
to
eschew
solid
black
and
society
figures
in
favor
of
farce
in
bold
outline
the
more
sober
of
the
comic
papers
had
settled
staffs
and
settled
jokes
and
were
not
welcomed
not
that
jokes
were
very
good
labored
verbal
oddities
for
the
most
part
intellectual
quips
and
cranks
which
he
was
quite
aware
lacked
the
true
humorous
insight
of
jimmy
raven
upon
whom
he
modelled
himself
feeling
no
impulse
humor
indeed
was
not
his
vocation
when
he
saw
the
world
through
eyes
he
was
tickled
yet
fortified
as
one
set
face
to
face
with
the
prose
of
the
real
and
finding
it
genial
but
he
could
not
see
it
like
this
himself
his
was
a
world
of
beauty
set
over
a
strange
disquieting
substratum
of
ugliness
from
which
it
were
best
to
avert
eyes
and
which
perhaps
existed
only
as
something
to
aspire
away
from
jimmy
raven
had
published
of
which
matt
strang
had
found
vastly
entertaining
and
yet
matt
strang
saw
rather
the
tragedy
of
beggars
than
their
humor
and
this
tragedy
seemed
to
him
outside
the
realm
of
art
it
was
only
their
occasional
picturesqueness
that
attracted
his
artistic
interest
at
this
period
of
his
development
and
all
the
figures
of
his
comic
sketches
were
either
pretty
or
picturesque
he
studied
extensively
in
the
streets
in
hand
fearful
of
losing
the
subtleties
of
nature
through
his
inability
to
afford
even
the
cheap
casual
models
of
his
first
days
in
london
and
training
himself
to
catch
the
salient
points
of
character
or
movement
at
first
glance
probably
no
artist
ever
made
comic
pictures
so
seriously
as
matt
strang
with
such
scrupulous
backgrounds
in
the
which
when
they
were
done
in
wash
he
strove
with
entirely
unappreciated
thoroughness
by
careful
adjustment
of
values
to
make
his
black
and
white
yield
veracious
when
the
drawings
were
accepted
they
came
out
so
reduced
and
so
badly
reproduced
that
the
subtleties
were
blurred
away
and
the
values
quite
transmuted
falsified
the
lines
or
photography
the
color
and
thus
their
appearance
in
print
was
as
much
a
pain
as
a
pleasure
redemption
from
comic
journalism
was
partly
due
to
the
prosperity
of
the
proprietor
of
the
factory
who
started
a
department
where
matt
found
less
uncongenial
work
in
painting
figures
into
the
landscapes
of
his
less
competent
this
gradually
opened
up
to
his
astonished
eyes
a
new
section
of
the
trade
he
saw
one
of
these
landscapes
near
cross
resplendent
in
a
gorgeous
gold
frame
and
marked
two
guineas
only
and
another
in
a
poor
neighborhood
marked
a
bargain
and
he
perceived
that
he
had
been
flying
too
high
in
his
early
attempts
to
approach
dealers
of
the
type
of
drücker
henceforward
he
haunted
furniture
dealers
makers
and
colormen
and
thus
he
occasionally
obtained
half
a
sovereign
to
despatch
to
his
tailor
his
drawings
in
the
attracted
the
attention
of
the
editor
of
the
and
matt
was
commissioned
to
accompany
a
journalist
through
the
east
end
to
expose
the
evils
of
sweating
the
was
owned
by
a
syndicate
and
matt
had
to
settle
terms
with
the
manager
a
truculent
gentleman
with
a
double
chin
and
a
double
who
agreed
to
give
him
five
shillings
a
sketch
matt
did
several
sketches
for
each
article
and
the
pathetic
series
caused
a
great
stir
and
much
correspondence
but
at
the
end
of
the
month
when
poor
matt
who
had
already
nearly
starved
himself
for
his
sake
was
expecting
a
goodly
check
to
send
to
abner
preep
he
received
only
a
quarter
of
what
he
had
bargained
for
he
went
to
the
editor
who
referred
him
to
the
manager
who
insisted
the
terms
were
five
shillings
for
the
illustration
of
a
single
article
must
remember
too
what
a
lift
we
are
giving
you
with
our
big
circulation
concluded
the
manager
his
double
heaving
pompously
on
his
abdomen
is
not
every
young
man
who
gets
such
a
chance
of
showing
what
he
can
a
set
of
damned
scoundrels
cried
matt
with
an
access
of
ancient
rage
and
had
wellnigh
torn
up
the
check
and
thrown
it
in
the
face
when
his
later
chastened
self
plucked
at
his
and
bade
him
begone
with
it
who
so
helpless
as
the
artist
his
work
poorly
paid
and
reproduced
again
and
again
without
his
control
his
very
originals
taken
from
him
and
sometimes
sold
at
a
profit
it
was
not
a
happy
time
for
matt
this
period
of
spiritless
work
by
day
and
spiritless
study
by
night
his
soul
chafing
alike
against
the
degradations
of
life
and
the
routine
of
school
for
what
an
actuality
had
he
exchanged
his
dreams
yet
he
had
no
option
the
tailor
must
be
paid
his
family
must
be
helped
and
to
these
two
ends
moreover
he
himself
must
exist
but
the
friction
of
ideals
and
realities
left
him
irritable
and
and
even
when
towards
the
autumn
he
won
his
way
into
the
at
a
guinea
an
illustration
he
lost
his
work
by
not
concealing
his
contempt
for
the
art
editor
a
pragmatic
person
absolutely
dead
to
art
but
excessively
fastidious
about
the
drawings
which
he
refused
whenever
there
was
time
for
alterations
is
feeble
but
pressed
for
time
was
his
encouraging
apology
to
the
artist
for
accepting
his
work
put
it
into
the
hands
of
a
competent
his
first
to
matt
was
his
complaint
about
some
rough
shadows
on
the
borders
of
a
sketch
wish
you
would
bear
in
mind
strang
that
we
have
to
pay
as
much
per
inch
for
the
reproduction
of
those
blotches
as
for
the
most
finished
but
it
was
not
till
the
as
the
other
artists
called
the
art
editor
of
the
behind
his
back
had
insisted
on
his
dressing
his
figures
better
that
matt
lost
control
of
his
tongue
and
retorted
draw
pictures
not
in
he
would
have
been
glad
to
get
to
do
he
replaced
the
lost
work
by
returning
to
though
he
now
obtained
more
important
work
on
enlarged
photographs
which
he
colored
in
oil
at
three
and
six
apiece
managing
to
do
two
or
three
a
day
while
the
light
held
without
interfering
with
his
black
and
white
which
could
be
done
at
night
by
which
means
he
scraped
together
enough
to
pay
off
the
tailor
in
full
and
to
send
his
promised
contribution
home
together
with
seven
fourpenny
halfpenny
to
reconcile
billy
to
his
narrow
existence
and
then
with
these
burdens
thrown
off
his
idealism
resurged
again
for
beneath
the
placid
everyday
exterior
of
this
homely
young
man
who
trudged
up
foul
staircases
portfolio
under
arm
or
danced
attendance
on
smug
photographers
smoking
twopenny
cigars
a
volcanic
fire
burned
and
the
thought
of
his
precious
youth
wasted
and
abraded
in
this
inartistic
under
the
yoke
of
vulgar
souls
was
a
dull
haunting
torment
his
qualms
of
vanished
under
the
pressure
of
obstacles
and
the
measure
of
his
aversion
from
joyless
commercial
art
became
to
him
the
measure
of
his
genius
one
gray
windy
forenoon
of
late
autumn
he
had
stopped
to
take
a
mental
sketch
of
a
strangely
attired
woman
who
was
listening
to
a
salvation
army
exhortation
a
woman
who
was
a
dab
of
color
upon
the
dreary
day
below
an
enormous
white
hat
with
a
recumbent
ostrich
feather
and
a
broad
brim
with
an
upward
slant
tied
under
the
chin
with
black
bands
shone
through
a
black
veil
a
glorious
dark
face
with
flashing
eyes
full
red
lips
large
shapely
ears
and
raven
hair
curling
low
over
the
forehead
she
wore
a
black
jacket
with
big
buttons
and
a
yellow
bow
that
was
awry
and
by
a
shapely
hand
cased
in
a
white
glove
with
three
black
stripes
she
held
the
skirts
of
a
slaty
gown
clear
of
the
mud
while
matt
was
whimsically
wondering
what
the
editor
of
the
would
say
to
a
sketch
of
her
in
his
staid
organ
he
instinctively
noted
the
other
romantic
touches
about
the
scene
ineffably
grimy
though
the
roadway
was
to
the
inartistic
eye
flanked
on
one
side
by
a
coal
office
with
a
old
man
at
the
window
and
on
the
other
by
a
canal
running
lengthwise
there
were
fresh
country
faces
among
the
and
among
the
men
was
an
in
a
turban
a
flaring
paisley
shawl
flowing
robes
and
sandals
bearing
aloft
a
red
flag
with
a
blue
border
and
a
central
yellow
star
around
which
ran
the
words
and
and
while
his
eye
selected
the
picturesque
points
the
whole
scene
passed
half
insensibly
into
his
as
into
a
camera
to
be
developed
in
the
grotesque
hags
in
the
crowd
the
collarless
men
with
the
air
of
being
connected
with
the
canal
one
of
them
with
a
mephistophelian
red
tuft
on
his
chin
the
stall
at
the
corner
where
a
postman
a
baby
of
three
and
an
urchin
with
his
collar
paradoxically
up
against
the
cold
were
licking
green
glasses
and
then
a
buxom
with
a
tambourine
began
to
hold
forth
pouring
out
breathless
sentences
all
running
into
one
another
clutching
her
inspiration
tight
lest
it
should
escape
her
and
repeating
herself
endlessly
rather
than
pause
for
a
moment
the
blood
of
christ
can
save
only
the
blood
of
christ
has
saved
only
the
blood
of
christ
will
and
her
quivering
with
unction
punctuated
her
shapeless
periods
with
ejaculations
to
may
try
earthly
pleasures
you
may
go
to
the
theaytre
she
gasped
it
brings
no
peace
nothing
brings
peace
but
the
rock
but
the
lamb
the
oldest
of
all
religions
proved
over
and
over
again
christianity
tried
in
the
furnace
any
day
you
may
die
no
one
knows
the
end
the
time
put
it
off
come
are
you
prepared
once
i
had
bad
companions
a
ah
groaned
a
melodramatic
brother
with
folded
arms
i
gave
them
up
in
a
great
sob
of
relief
from
all
the
palpitating
figures
matt
began
to
forget
the
visual
aspects
of
the
scene
the
infectious
emotion
of
the
girl
and
her
comrades
gained
upon
him
what
she
was
saying
left
no
dint
on
his
mind
to
her
dogmas
he
was
become
indifferent
but
her
earnestness
thrilled
him
her
impassioned
ignorance
flashed
upon
him
a
clearer
sense
of
baseness
hollowness
insincere
falling
away
from
the
ideals
that
had
sailed
with
him
to
england
glorifying
the
noisome
steerage
turning
his
head
he
saw
tears
rolling
down
the
dark
passionate
face
of
his
dashing
neighbor
and
he
hurried
away
shaken
and
troubled
pursued
by
the
cacophonous
melody
into
which
the
street
congregation
had
broken
what
was
the
point
of
his
life
what
had
he
become
at
there
were
fellows
who
looked
to
art
as
an
escape
from
some
calling
that
was
not
had
never
been
his
idea
to
him
art
was
an
end
in
itself
he
was
of
those
who
live
to
paint
not
paint
to
live
even
in
his
boyish
days
when
the
vendibility
of
pictures
first
came
within
his
ken
the
money
had
always
seemed
to
him
a
pleasant
not
a
motive
and
now
instead
of
pouring
out
on
canvas
all
that
effervescence
of
youthful
poetry
that
flooded
his
soul
he
was
coloring
photographs
and
illustrating
foolish
stories
for
foolish
editors
in
contravention
of
all
his
own
ideas
of
what
illustrations
should
be
why
even
in
nova
scotia
he
had
painted
from
the
life
in
his
lowest
days
he
had
decorated
furniture
at
his
own
pleasure
oh
it
was
sordid
unworthy
humiliating
he
would
give
it
all
up
if
he
could
not
pursue
art
at
least
he
would
not
degrade
it
thanks
to
his
training
his
good
right
hand
could
do
more
than
wield
the
brush
better
to
earn
bread
and
water
for
himself
and
his
family
by
some
honest
craft
till
such
time
as
honest
art
came
within
his
means
rather
an
honest
artisan
than
a
dishonest
artist
and
while
he
was
still
hot
with
the
impulse
he
looked
through
the
advertisement
columns
of
the
and
answered
three
demands
one
for
a
another
for
a
and
the
third
for
a
the
firm
alone
answered
and
he
was
asked
to
call
he
stated
that
he
had
had
considerable
experience
of
the
manufacture
in
nova
scotia
but
a
brief
conversation
convinced
the
manager
that
the
applicant
knew
nothing
of
scientific
with
its
elaborate
engines
and
differentiation
of
labor
but
sober
respectable
appearance
and
his
conviction
of
his
capacity
stood
him
in
good
stead
and
he
was
given
a
trial
at
eighteen
shillings
a
week
with
a
prospect
of
rising
to
forty
in
his
confidence
of
mastering
the
easy
detail
and
to
clinch
his
resolution
he
wrote
to
his
art
patrons
throwing
up
his
position
in
each
establishment
with
due
form
and
superfluous
sarcasm
and
one
happy
morning
soon
after
sunrise
repaired
to
the
factory
with
a
more
buoyant
tread
than
had
been
his
since
the
memorable
day
when
he
crossed
the
great
bridge
which
led
to
the
heart
of
all
the
splendors
the
end
found
him
spiritually
seared
and
physically
scalded
the
depressing
society
of
the
british
the
contrast
of
the
blank
building
with
the
free
forest
in
which
he
had
made
sugar
in
his
boyhood
how
happy
his
boyhood
seemed
now
and
the
overflowing
contents
of
the
seething
boilers
demonstrated
to
him
daily
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
he
might
have
stayed
on
nevertheless
but
the
dread
that
an
accidental
scald
on
the
hand
might
permanently
injure
his
power
with
the
brush
made
the
trial
fortnight
his
last
he
scanned
the
advertisement
columns
again
with
no
suspicion
of
what
now
awaited
him
he
had
been
misled
by
the
comparative
facility
with
which
he
had
found
work
hitherto
he
was
now
destined
to
far
more
poignantly
than
in
new
brunswick
the
agony
of
unemployment
the
sickness
of
hope
deferred
to
bruise
himself
against
the
ruthless
indifference
of
an
overstaffed
nation
to
see
and
hear
the
blind
deaf
forces
of
the
social
machine
grind
out
happiness
for
all
but
him
at
first
he
did
not
mind
getting
no
replies
except
for
the
waste
of
stamps
for
he
took
feverish
advantage
of
the
hours
of
daylight
thus
left
free
for
art
but
as
day
followed
day
and
week
followed
week
the
perturbation
of
his
soul
and
the
weakness
of
his
body
enfeebled
by
hunger
and
cold
made
painting
difficult
and
he
had
not
even
the
capital
to
expend
on
canvas
broken
in
health
and
pride
he
applied
again
for
his
old
work
prepared
even
to
tint
but
his
place
had
been
filled
up
the
stream
of
human
life
had
flowed
on
as
if
he
had
never
been
the
work
he
had
got
was
the
only
work
in
london
open
to
a
man
in
his
position
and
this
work
he
had
thrown
away
one
of
the
papers
he
had
so
imprudently
quarrelled
with
was
willing
to
take
him
on
again
but
at
half
the
price
subdued
as
he
was
a
pride
he
afterwards
felt
to
have
been
insane
spurred
him
to
refuse
he
fancied
he
could
get
such
terms
from
a
score
of
other
papers
but
he
was
mistaken
in
truth
black
and
white
was
no
more
his
than
humor
the
rush
into
black
and
white
of
which
he
had
first
heard
at
had
filled
the
ranks
with
abler
men
or
of
older
standing
with
a
better
appreciation
of
the
market
and
of
how
to
draw
for
reproduction
by
the
new
processes
just
coming
up
and
he
had
yet
to
learn
also
that
the
world
went
very
well
without
him
that
it
had
no
need
for
him
either
as
artist
or
artisan
craftsman
or
clerk
that
every
hole
had
its
peg
round
or
square
and
that
he
was
of
no
more
account
in
the
surging
life
of
london
than
the
fallen
leaves
blown
about
the
bleak
squares
he
earned
a
few
odd
shillings
now
and
then
for
his
old
pictures
by
persuading
some
small
skinflint
dealer
to
cheat
him
and
that
was
all
once
he
was
cruelly
tantalized
a
commission
to
copy
a
national
gallery
picture
being
dangled
before
him
only
to
be
withdrawn
he
parted
with
all
but
the
barest
necessities
with
the
fashionable
morning
suit
with
his
pistol
with
the
gregson
boots
his
only
luxury
was
the
engraving
of
the
which
he
had
retained
because
nobody
offered
more
than
eighteenpence
for
it
the
bulk
of
the
money
thus
raised
was
remitted
to
abner
preep
as
promised
the
rest
went
to
pay
lipchild
himself
he
so
stinted
that
often
when
he
went
to
which
he
had
fortunately
prepaid
he
took
care
to
arrive
first
not
only
because
of
the
warmth
but
because
the
girl
students
whose
class
preceded
his
left
stale
crusts
lying
about
whose
crumb
had
been
used
up
on
their
charcoal
drawings
to
such
straits
may
a
man
sink
in
a
few
weeks
though
he
sinks
slowly
for
each
week
is
a
year
to
him
but
outwardly
he
preserved
dignity
brushing
his
one
suit
scrupulously
and
glad
that
owing
to
his
interlude
of
fashionable
tailoring
it
was
still
in
good
condition
for
the
vision
of
the
lost
mortals
was
ever
before
his
eyes
and
he
foresaw
that
without
a
decent
appearance
he
would
not
be
able
to
grasp
an
opportunity
even
when
it
came
but
would
be
driven
down
to
the
deeps
to
join
the
damned
souls
outside
that
fleet
street
within
which
the
happier
staff
of
the
ushered
in
the
sabbath
with
beer
and
the
more
london
refused
him
the
more
his
consciousness
of
power
grew
as
he
tramped
the
teeming
streets
in
quest
of
a
job
or
a
customer
a
thousand
ideas
for
great
pictures
jostled
in
his
sick
brain
a
thousand
fine
imaginings
took
form
and
shape
in
beautiful
and
majestic
groupings
in
the
ecstatic
frenzy
of
moments
of
hysterical
revolt
against
the
blind
forces
closing
in
upon
him
like
a
tomb
to
shut
him
out
forever
from
the
sunlight
he
grew
titanic
to
his
own
thought
capable
of
masterpieces
in
any
and
every
kind
of
art
great
heroic
frescos
like
michael
great
homely
pictures
like
those
of
the
dutch
great
classic
canvases
like
great
portraits
like
great
landscapes
like
great
modern
like
great
mediæval
romances
like
not
to
say
great
new
pictures
that
should
found
the
school
of
strang
combining
all
the
best
points
of
all
the
schools
the
ancient
poetry
with
the
modern
realism
nay
even
literary
impulses
mingled
with
artistic
in
these
spasms
of
nebulous
emotion
his
immature
genius
not
having
yet
grasped
the
limitations
of
the
paintable
good
god
what
did
he
ask
not
the
voluptuous
round
of
the
young
men
whose
elegant
silhouettes
standing
out
against
the
black
silent
night
from
the
warm
lighted
windows
of
great
houses
athrob
with
joyous
music
filled
him
with
a
mad
bitterness
not
the
soft
languors
of
the
beautiful
white
women
who
passed
in
shimmering
silks
and
laces
from
gleaming
carriages
under
canvas
awnings
over
purple
carpets
amid
spruce
obsequious
footmen
not
the
selfish
joys
of
these
radiant
shadows
dancing
their
way
to
dusty
oblivion
to
be
trodden
under
foot
by
the
generations
over
which
he
would
shine
as
a
star
serene
immortal
but
bread
and
water
and
a
little
money
for
models
and
properties
and
a
straight
in
touch
with
heaven
and
a
few
pounds
to
send
home
to
his
kith
and
kin
but
to
paint
to
paint
to
joy
in
conception
and
to
glory
in
difficult
execution
to
express
the
poetry
of
the
ideal
through
real
flesh
and
real
shadows
and
real
foliage
and
find
a
rapturous
agony
in
the
search
for
perfection
to
paint
to
paint
to
exult
fiercely
in
the
passing
of
faces
with
their
pathos
and
their
tragedy
to
catch
a
smile
on
a
face
and
the
grace
of
a
movement
and
the
passion
in
the
eyes
of
a
woman
to
watch
the
sunrise
consecrating
tiles
and
chimneys
or
the
river
mirroring
a
thousand
glide
on
glorifying
its
own
uncleanness
to
express
the
intense
stimulus
of
the
wonderful
city
resonant
with
the
tireless
tread
of
millions
of
feet
vibrant
with
the
swirl
of
perpetual
currents
of
traffic
pulsating
with
the
rough
music
of
markets
shrilling
trains
panting
steamships
to
record
in
pigment
not
only
the
romance
of
his
dreams
or
the
glamour
of
the
dead
past
but
the
poetry
of
the
quick
the
rich
full
life
of
the
town
the
restless
day
and
the
feverish
night
with
its
mysterious
perspectives
of
fitful
gleams
to
paint
to
paint
anything
everything
for
the
joy
of
eternalizing
the
transient
beauty
that
lurked
everywhere
in
the
shimmer
of
a
sunlit
puddle
in
the
starry
heaven
in
the
motions
of
barefoot
children
dancing
to
a
in
the
scarlet
passing
of
soldiers
in
the
play
of
light
on
the
fish
in
a
barrow
in
the
shadowy
aisles
of
city
churches
throbbing
with
organ
diapasons
oh
the
joy
of
life
oh
the
joy
of
art
that
expressed
the
joy
of
life
yes
but
in
the
absence
of
a
few
bits
of
metal
neither
joy
nor
art
nor
even
life
could
be
his
he
must
die
be
swept
off
from
among
the
surging
crowds
of
which
he
was
an
unnoticed
unit
and
no
one
would
ever
know
what
mighty
things
he
had
dreamed
and
suffered
in
his
little
span
of
years
every
supper
eaten
by
radiant
couples
at
richly
lit
restaurants
would
have
nourished
him
for
weeks
nor
did
it
diminish
the
bitter
socialistic
sentiment
this
reflection
caused
him
to
remember
that
he
himself
had
fared
as
wantonly
once
and
again
at
least
he
had
earned
his
money
what
gave
those
young
men
with
the
vacant
faces
those
women
with
the
improbable
complexions
the
right
to
all
the
good
things
at
the
table
of
life
even
herbert
was
splashed
by
this
wave
of
bitterness
herbert
the
brilliant
with
his
battalion
of
boots
ah
poor
little
billy
was
right
it
was
impossible
to
believe
in
anything
to
see
any
justice
in
life
and
was
it
worth
while
going
on
the
thought
presented
itself
again
and
again
especially
in
those
november
days
when
london
was
as
dark
as
his
own
soul
and
it
made
him
half
sorry
half
glad
that
a
grim
providence
had
sent
his
pistol
to
the
pawnshop
he
was
walking
to
one
evening
in
such
a
double
darkness
of
without
and
within
when
the
memory
came
to
him
of
a
newspaper
paragraph
concerning
people
who
had
wandered
into
the
river
and
hypnotized
by
the
idea
he
bent
his
steps
towards
the
docks
with
a
vague
intention
of
giving
death
a
chance
what
did
it
matter
what
became
of
his
brothers
and
sisters
it
were
better
that
they
died
too
in
any
case
he
could
not
help
them
any
more
he
had
just
scraped
together
the
usual
remittance
but
he
could
not
see
where
the
next
was
to
come
from
but
his
motion
did
not
bear
him
towards
the
in
the
gray
obscurity
he
erred
endlessly
in
strange
ghostly
squares
whose
chill
enclosures
loomed
like
cemeteries
through
the
sepulchral
air
london
smelled
like
a
boiled
sponge
the
raw
air
reeked
with
sulphurous
grime
as
if
the
chimneys
of
hell
had
been
swept
it
was
not
an
inviting
world
to
remain
in
a
gigantic
brown
head
of
a
horse
suddenly
shot
past
his
he
jumped
back
but
a
shadowy
wheel
caught
him
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
and
hurled
him
across
the
road
where
he
fell
on
his
back
hearing
inarticulate
noises
from
the
cabman
and
just
seeing
the
hansom
swallowed
up
again
by
the
yellow
sea
he
got
up
feeling
dazed
and
indignant
rather
than
hurt
and
staggered
along
in
purposeless
pursuit
of
the
vanished
cab
he
found
himself
in
a
business
street
where
the
illumined
thinned
the
fog
a
familiar
face
with
a
strange
green
light
upon
it
from
a
window
burst
upon
him
as
unexpectedly
as
the
horse
it
was
he
studied
it
abstractedly
for
a
moment
in
its
greenish
pallor
with
its
deep
furrows
seeming
to
read
clearly
a
weariness
and
akin
to
his
own
and
struck
for
the
first
time
by
the
shabbiness
and
flaccidity
of
the
figure
then
the
face
took
a
more
joyous
expression
than
he
had
ever
seen
in
it
and
he
heard
tarmigan
saying
strang
are
you
lost
too
sir
at
least
i
quite
know
sir
he
replied
like
one
awaking
from
a
dream
usually
at
at
this
hour
on
my
way
there
if
you
are
going
we
had
better
keep
you
sir
said
matt
he
went
into
the
to
inquire
their
whereabouts
and
feeling
a
little
stiff
had
the
sudden
idea
of
laying
out
his
last
coppers
in
arnica
then
he
began
to
pilot
his
master
with
a
sense
of
lofty
responsibility
but
they
walked
in
silence
mutually
embarrassed
tarmigan
coughed
lengthily
you
to
be
out
on
a
night
like
this
sir
matt
ventured
to
say
my
boy
duty
rejoined
tarmigan
gruffly
you
are
not
bound
to
go
are
you
sir
matt
remonstrated
remembering
that
services
were
a
voluntary
sacrifice
at
the
shrine
of
art
am
not
forced
by
an
outsider
if
what
you
mean
said
tarmigan
that
be
duty
that
would
be
necessity
at
least
in
my
duty
is
only
what
you
feel
you
ought
to
do
said
matt
any
man
who
knows
what
true
art
is
is
bound
to
hand
it
down
to
the
next
generation
especially
in
an
age
when
there
is
so
much
false
doctrine
in
the
each
generation
find
out
its
own
art
matt
asked
timidly
each
generation
find
out
its
own
science
tarmigan
retorted
sharply
all
things
there
is
a
great
human
tradition
and
the
torch
is
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
otherwise
we
should
be
in
a
nice
fog
he
added
grimly
and
coughed
again
a
nice
fog
the
young
men
are
in
who
reject
the
light
of
the
past
with
their
azure
art
and
their
violet
nonsense
and
their
slapdash
they
seem
to
be
gaining
the
public
ear
matt
murmured
liking
neither
to
contradict
his
master
nor
to
agree
with
him
public
ear
tarmigan
laughed
scornfully
they
gain
that
but
not
the
public
eye
thank
god
that
can
still
tell
slipshod
botchery
from
honest
faithful
cornpepper
is
in
the
academy
this
year
matt
reminded
him
the
academy
lets
itself
be
outbawled
said
tarmigan
sharply
wish
i
were
a
member
wish
you
were
said
matt
fervently
tarmigan
coughed
mean
what
you
mean
he
said
gruffly
but
they
ought
to
elect
you
sir
said
matt
rushing
in
on
delicate
ground
in
his
enthusiasm
for
the
character
says
everybody
tarmigan
inquired
bitterly
say
so
for
i
go
to
its
the
say
so
for
unknown
to
their
wives
but
i
am
unjust
let
us
drop
the
subject
after
all
a
work
stands
even
if
he
is
passed
over
in
his
matt
felt
a
sharp
pang
of
sympathy
for
this
strong
stern
man
sustained
by
the
false
dream
of
immortality
he
could
not
conceive
that
posterity
would
care
a
rap
for
cold
classic
pictures
indeed
now
that
he
had
assimilated
all
that
was
good
in
teaching
he
only
went
to
the
studio
for
the
sake
of
the
model
and
the
practice
emotion
and
embarrassment
kept
him
silent
you
live
with
your
people
tarmigan
asked
presently
in
an
interested
tone
said
matt
are
in
ah
yes
so
you
told
me
not
married
engaged
i
hope
said
matt
wonderingly
right
no
artist
should
marry
his
wife
is
sure
to
drag
him
down
to
sacrifice
his
art
to
her
pleasures
and
wants
fine
feathers
and
fine
houses
are
ruining
english
art
i
warn
you
of
this
because
you
have
the
makings
of
an
artist
if
you
work
are
very
kind
sir
said
matt
touched
at
all
you
have
a
fine
natural
talent
still
undisciplined
so
long
as
you
keep
yourself
free
from
matrimonial
complications
you
may
hope
to
achieve
something
a
single
man
can
live
on
bread
and
water
i
am
heartily
glad
to
hear
you
have
nobody
to
keep
but
matt
smiled
grimly
under
the
imagined
cover
of
the
fog
i
know
what
smiling
at
said
tarmigan
more
genially
than
he
had
yet
spoken
wondering
whether
the
preacher
is
a
bachelor
well
i
am
proud
to
say
still
single
though
i
boast
of
living
on
bread
and
water
you
see
it
only
the
expense
marriage
spoils
the
silent
incubation
of
ideas
the
wife
wants
her
husband
not
his
suppose
an
artist
falls
in
love
it
hard
on
him
asked
matt
man
can
serve
two
masters
every
artist
has
got
to
ask
himself
does
he
want
happiness
or
does
he
want
art
that
choice
will
face
one
day
hope
not
said
matt
i
guess
enough
for
he
spoke
in
a
tone
of
quiet
conviction
and
his
bosom
swelled
happiness
forsooth
how
could
there
be
happiness
apart
from
art
or
how
could
art
be
apart
from
happiness
their
talk
fell
to
a
lower
level
matt
casually
expressed
an
ardent
wish
to
see
sundry
especially
the
president
he
had
only
come
across
the
painters
or
the
young
men
he
felt
vaguely
that
he
was
at
one
with
butler
and
greme
and
herbert
and
apparently
tarmigan
also
in
despising
them
though
he
had
only
seen
one
of
their
exhibitions
they
were
in
power
and
popular
and
therefore
mediocrities
yet
beneath
all
this
prejudice
was
a
keen
curiosity
about
them
and
a
latent
respect
for
these
oldsters
who
had
arrived
tarmigan
promised
to
get
him
a
ticket
for
the
prize
distribution
of
the
academy
schools
next
month
when
he
would
see
most
of
them
the
suggestion
of
suicide
slunk
into
the
rear
the
spectacle
of
the
academicians
was
something
to
live
for
then
the
old
man
and
the
young
relapsed
into
silent
thoughts
of
their
art
projecting
visions
of
ideal
beauty
on
the
background
of
yellow
grimy
vapor
that
shrouded
the
great
dreary
city
but
when
matt
sat
down
to
paint
that
night
he
found
himself
incapacitated
a
mass
of
aches
and
bruises
he
went
home
to
anoint
himself
with
his
arnica
in
the
unconscious
optimism
of
sickness
the
suggestion
of
suicide
had
vanished
altogether
chapter

medal
with
a
step
that
faltered
from
nervousness
even
more
than
from
the
weakness
due
to
a
diet
of
one
meal
per
diem
matt
strang
passed
across
the
clangorous
of
burlington
house
nigh
turned
back
by
the
imposing
bustle
of
broughams
and
cabs
whose
shadows
were
thrown
sharply
on
the
stones
under
the
keen
frosty
starshine
of
the
december
night
in
the
hall
he
shrank
back
even
more
timidly
blinking
at
the
radiance
of
the
company
the
white
of
the
men
the
dazzling
shoulders
of
the
women
before
a
counter
a
block
of
black
figures
struggled
to
get
rid
of
their
hats
and
coats
in
exchange
for
numbers
matt
hid
his
hat
fortunately
flexible
in
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
which
being
the
least
shabby
of
his
vestments
by
reason
of
its
summer
vacation
he
did
not
dare
to
take
off
otherwise
he
would
not
have
dared
to
keep
it
on
there
were
spots
of
discoloration
on
the
concealed
garments
for
they
had
suffered
from
the
job
which
together
with
the
expectation
of
this
had
kept
him
alive
since
he
had
met
tarmigan
in
the
fog
three
weeks
before
as
a
and
distemperer
matt
had
still
hovered
on
the
verge
of
art
and
if
butler
was
right
in
his
interpretation
of
the
academy
of
his
day
and
the
highest
art
was
indeed
to
conceal
paint
then
was
the
young
nova
scotian
strictly
academic
in
retaining
his
overcoat
on
this
most
academic
of
occasions
he
marched
with
the
courage
of
desperation
up
a
broad
crimson
staircase
keenly
conscious
of
the
frayed
edges
of
his
trousers
and
mistily
aware
of
overarching
palms
and
bordering
and
fashionable
companions
and
surrendered
the
ticket
tarmigan
had
given
him
to
a
sumptuous
official
who
seemed
a
part
of
the
ornamental
avenue
to
the
academic
salons
once
safely
past
this
point
the
haze
cleared
and
he
saw
to
his
joy
less
fashionable
figures
in
and
ladies
in
hats
and
jackets
and
though
he
wished
they
had
been
more
numerous
and
more
dowdy
he
felt
a
morsel
more
at
ease
there
seemed
to
be
pictures
on
view
and
he
eagerly
joined
the
sparse
groups
of
spectators
that
promenaded
the
rooms
in
curious
contrast
with
the
crush
of
the
populace
the
last
time
he
had
walked
at
the
price
of
a
shilling
within
these
historic
walls
the
exhibition
was
curious
in
one
room
dozens
of
heads
some
evidently
from
the
same
model
in
another
cartoons
of
draped
figures
in
a
third
sculptures
he
saw
from
a
placard
that
they
had
been
done
in
competition
for
the
prizes
that
were
to
be
adjudged
he
heard
scraps
of
foolish
criticism
from
the
people
about
him
but
his
commerce
with
had
blunted
his
once
sensitive
nerves
and
he
was
only
amused
from
the
pictures
his
eyes
strayed
to
the
spectators
and
he
wondered
which
were
celebrities
it
occurred
to
him
with
a
pang
of
dismay
that
in
the
absence
of
any
cicerone
he
might
go
away
no
wiser
than
he
had
come
and
he
remembered
with
regret
the
personally
conducted
tour
he
had
made
through
the
reynolds
club
would
his
uncle
be
here
he
thought
with
apprehensive
shrinking
as
he
moved
aimlessly
about
thinking
of
the
old
gentleman
his
heart
leaped
to
see

but
before
nebuchadnezzar
and
not
the
before
he
knew
but
other
daniels
and
other
nebuchadnezzars
a
veritable
vision
of
daniels
and
nebuchadnezzars
a
gallery
of
daniels
and
nebuchadnezzars
perspectives
of
daniels
and
nebuchadnezzars
stretching
away
on
both
sides
of
the
room
young
daniels
and
old
daniels
and
daniels
with
mustaches
daniels
with
uplifted
arms
and
daniels
with
downcast
eyes
daniels
dressed
and
daniels
undressed
daniels
with
flashing
faces
and
daniels
with
turned
backs
and
nebuchadnezzars
analogously
assorted
and
palaces
of
equal
variety
and
backgrounds
of
similar
dissimilarity
each
tableau
differing
in
properties
and
supernumeraries
but
all
appearing
only
the
more
alike
because
of
their
differences
so
conventional
were
the
variations
matt
divined
instantly
that
the
picture
herbert
had
painted
must
be
among
them
and
he
looked
about
ardently
for
the
painted
palace
in
which
he
had
spent
so
many
happy
hours
ah
there
it
was
the
dear
old
canvas
though
it
had
an
grandeur
in
its
broad
gold
frame
there
was
daniel
and
there
was
more
finished
than
when
he
had
last
seen
herbert
at
work
on
them
that
fatal
midsummer
day
but
essentially
unchanged
he
felt
quite
a
small
proprietary
interest
in
it
unconscious
how
much
it
really
owed
to
him
his
touches
on
the
actual
final
canvas
had
been
but
few
and
these
mainly
suggestions
in
pastel
and
his
remembrance
of
the
scaffolding
work
that
preceded
was
hopelessly
blurred
by
the
countless
discussions
he
was
shaken
by
a
resurgence
of
pleasant
memories
of
these
artistic
talks
and
merry
lunches
with
the
bright
sunshine
streaming
down
on
the
skin
rugs
and
the
gleaming
busts
he
became
absorbed
in
the
painting
seeing
episodes
of
the
past
in
it
like
a
magician
looking
into
a
pool
of
ink
and
then
he
was
pierced
to
the
marrow
as
by
an
icy
wind
he
heard
an
ecstatic
voice
ejaculating
it
beautiful
the
dear
boy
in
charming
foreign
accents
and
he
divined
the
vandyke
beard
hovering
haughtily
in
his
rear
he
felt
the
couple
had
come
to
see
their
work
and
he
tried
to
sidle
away
unperceived
but
an
advancing
group
forced
him
to
turn
round
and
he
found
himself
eye
to
eye
with
madame
whose
radiant
face
of
praise
was
exchanged
for
one
of
smiling
astonished
welcome
when
she
caught
sight
of
him
dear
young
she
began
in
accents
of
lively
affection
then
matt
saw
her
face
freeze
suddenly
and
he
quailed
beneath
the
glooming
eyebrows
of
her
dignified
consort
who
swept
round
the
other
way
with
the
frozen
lady
on
one
arm
and
herbert
on
the
other
turning
three
backs
to
his
nephew
in
a
sort
of
triple
insult
the
semicircular
sweep
which
veered
madame
off
brought
herbert
near
and
heart
beat
more
rapidly
as
his
whilom
with
its
silk
facings
brushed
against
his
tightly
buttoned
overcoat
the
glimpse
he
had
of
face
showed
it
severe
impassive
and
devoid
of
recognition
but
ere
the
young
gentleman
had
quite
swept
past
he
managed
to
give
his
homely
cousin
a
droll
dig
in
the
ribs
which
was
as
balm
in
gilead
to
the
lonely
youth
and
brought
back
in
a
great
wave
all
his
fondness
for
his
dashing
relative
with
whom
he
now
felt
himself
a
fellow
conspirator
in
a
facetious
imbroglio
the
last
lees
of
his
bitterness
were
extruded
by
the
dig
he
gazed
with
affectionate
admiration
after
the
solemn
of
his
cousin
receding
staidly
and
decorously
up
the
avenue
of
daniels
at
one
or
other
of
which
his
disengaged
hand
pointed
with
no
faintest
suggestion
of
droll
digs
in
its
immaculate
cuff
and
delicately
tapering
fingers
presently
there
was
a
marked
move
in
a
particular
direction
and
matt
joining
the
current
was
floated
towards
a
great
room
filled
with
chairs
and
already
half
full
of
gentlefolks
he
made
instinctively
for
the
rear
but
finding
himself
amid
a
mob
of
young
fellows
in
evening
dress
some
of
them
sporting
the
ivory
medal
of
studentship
he
retreated
farther
towards
the
front
ultimately
taking
up
a
position
on
the
last
chair
of
the
left
extremity
of
the
fourth
row
from
the
back
out
of
view
of
the
incomers
streaming
through
the
oaken
panels
it
was
a
broad
oblong
room
with
skylights
in
the
handsome
ceiling
and
large
watercolors
hanging
on
the
walls
a
temporary
dais
covered
by
a
crimson
baize
and
ascended
by
a
crimson
step
faced
the
audience
and
at
its
central
point
stood
a
lighted
from
the
right
by
a
lamp
matt
heard
whispered
comments
on
the
from
his
neighbors
now
it
was
a
knighted
brewer
who
rolled
his
corporeal
cask
into
a
front
seat
now
it
was
a
musical
conductor
with
an
air
of
exile
from
the
central
desk
a
few
painters
of
eminence
with
neither
handles
nor
tails
to
their
names
dotted
art
about
the
audience
while
wives
and
daughters
of
the
academically
distinguished
exhaled
an
aroma
of
fashion
striving
to
banish
all
reminiscences
of
paint
from
everything
but
their
complexions
here
and
there
was
an
actor
out
of
employment
or
a
strayed
nondescript
celebrity
and
on
a
plush
couch
to
the
right
of
the
platform
a
popular
author
chatted
noisily
with
a
pretty
vivacious
lady
journalist
the
mixture
was
completed
by
a
few
favored
relatives
of
the
students
like
and
madame
strang
whose
anxious
faces
were
clearly
visible
to
matt
in
a
diagonal
direction
a
few
rows
ahead
herbert
himself
herded
with
his
who
had
taken
exclusive
possession
of
the
back
rows
where
they
stood
in
evening
dress
a
serried
gallery
of
figures
prophesying
the
a
great
round
of
applause
from
their
ranks
set
everybody
peering
towards
the
door
only
to
encounter
the
stern
gaze
of
the
magnificent
beadle
whose
entry
had
prompted
the
salvoes
and
who
arrayed
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
rich
red
showed
like
a
venetian
amid
a
collection
of
engravings
a
more
general
outburst
of
clapping
accompanied
by
a
buzz
of
interest
greeted
the
arrival
of
the
less
picturesque
of
academicians
headed
by
the
president
the
procession
bowing
and
smiling
defiled
slowly
towards
the
dais
especial
enthusiasm
being
reserved
for
the
more
popular
or
the
newest
academicians
and
associates
the
students
having
a
ruling
hand
or
hands
in
the
distribution
of
the
noise
matt
craned
forward
eagerly
to
see
these
pillars
of
english
art
whose
names
flew
from
lip
to
lip
as
they
only
looked
like
men
he
had
a
flash
of
the
president
takes
his
seat
on
the
central
chair
flanked
and
backed
by
the
faithful
forty
and
the
trusty
thirty
minus
the
absentees
the
dispose
themselves
along
the
front
bench
the
occupy
the
rear
a
younger
set
on
the
whole
with
more
hair
on
their
heads
and
less
on
their
chins
the
beadle
solemnly
slides
the
oak
panels
to
cloistering
the
scene
from
the
world
and
a
religious
silence
spreads
from
him
till
it
infects
even
the
excited
back
rows
the
president
rises
bland
and
stately
there
is
a
roar
of
welcome
succeeded
by
a
deeper
hush
it
is
seen
that
he
has
papers
on
his
desk
and
is
about
to
declare
the
results
of
the
competitions
and
to
determine
the
destiny
of
dozens
if
not
the
future
of
english
art
there
is
no
vulgar
sensationalism
with
a
simple
dignity
befitting
the
venerable
institution
which
still
excludes
great
newspapers
and
great
painters
from
its
banquets
he
disdains
working
up
to
a
climax
and
starts
with
the
tidbit
of
the
evening
gold
medal
and
travelling
studentship
for
awarded
every
two
years
for
the
best
historical
painting
the
subject
this
year
being
before
the
president
pauses
for
a
breathless
instant
the
ranks
of
figures
standing
in
the
background
have
grown
rigid
with
excitement
the
president
imperturbably
announces
there
is
a
brief
pause
for
mental
digestion
then
a
great
crash
of
applause
the
harmonious
cacophony
of
clapping
hands
generous
lungs
and
frenzied
feet
matt
thrilling
through
and
through
with
joy
and
excitement
shouting
frantically
and
applauding
with
all
his
limbs
turns
to
look
for
herbert
amid
the
students
but
sees
only
rows
of
heaving
and
animated
black
arms
then
he
becomes
aware
of
his
cousin
strolling
leisurely
along
the
near
side
of
the
room
through
a
mad
tempest
of
cheering
towards
the
desk
a
faint
smile
playing
about
his
beautiful
boyish
lips
which
yet
tremble
a
little
matt
feels
proud
of
being
the
cousin
of
the
hero
of
the
moment
whose
course
he
follows
with
eyes
he
sees
him
reach
the
presidential
desk
and
receive
a
medal
and
an
envelope
from
the
great
man
who
shakes
hands
with
him
and
evidently
offers
words
of
congratulation
he
follows
his
passage
back
to
his
through
the
undiminished
tempest
then
his
eye
lights
suddenly
on
matthew
face
and
sees
great
tears
rolling
down
towards
the
vandyke
beard
while
beside
him
madame
strang
her
face
radiating
sunshine
her
eyes
dancing
throws
kisses
towards
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
who
carrying
his
honors
and
studiously
avoiding
the
weakness
of
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
his
parents
ploughs
his
way
amid
fraternal
to
his
place
among
his
cronies
there
is
a
rapid
exchange
of
criticism
and
gossip
among
the
students
ejaculations
of
commiseration
for
flinders
whose
friends
had
convinced
him
that
he
would
win
and
for
rands
a
poor
devil
of
talent
the
only
hope
of
a
desperately
genteel
family
in
dalston
but
comment
must
be
hushed
for
other
prizes
some
of
them
important
enough
have
to
be
announced
there
is
a
steady
succession
of
individual
students
more
or
less
blushing
moving
to
and
from
the
congratulatory
hand
some
stumbling
nervously
against
the
crimson
step
placed
in
front
of
his
desk
probably
by
the
beadle
to
disconcert
the
shy
some
fortunate
come
up
three
times
and
stumble
three
times
sometimes
they
are
girls
one
wears
spectacles
and
a
yellow
sash
and
has
the
curved
back
of
the
student
another
is
pretty
and
and
causes
a
furore
by
her
multiplex
successes
and
her
engaging
charm
a
third
is
handsome
but
gawky
with
bare
red
arms
a
young
man
who
wins
two
events
attracts
special
attention
by
his
poetical
head
and
his
rapt
air
of
mystic
reverie
and
goes
back
winking
then
the
president
commences
his
biennial
address
to
an
audience
of
students
throbbing
with
excitement
afire
with
the
of
all
that
applause
anxious
to
canvass
the
awards
and
dying
to
run
out
into
the
other
rooms
to
look
at
the
winning
pictures
which
have
in
some
instances
been
dark
horses
which
nobody
remembers
to
have
noticed
his
theme
is
the
evolution
of
ecclesiastical
art
for
half
an
hour
the
audience
always
with
the
exception
of
the
students
he
is
addressing
listens
patiently
to
the
procession
of
ornate
periods
classically
chiselled
hoping
to
emerge
from
the
dulness
and
gloom
of
obscure
epochs
into
the
light
of
familiar
names
then
the
seats
begin
to
feel
hard
by
the
aid
of
copious
shufflings
wrigglings
and
whisperings
they
drag
through
another
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
relieved
only
by
the
mention
of
albrecht
dürer
whose
name
is
unaccountably
received
with
rapturous
cheers
as
if
he
were
a
political
allusion
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
is
lightened
by
the
feeling
that
it
is
to
be
the
last
but
as
the
second
hour
arrives
without
a
harbinger
sentence
three
brave
men
arise
and
pass
through
the
portal
there
is
tremendous
cheering
from
the
back
which
is
taken
up
and
from
all
parts
of
the
room
and
the
president
beams
and
turns
over
a
new
page
the
seats
become
granite
the
presidential
eloquence
flows
on
as
if
it
would
wear
them
away
an
endlessly
trickling
stream
he
enters
into
painful
analyses
of
vanished
frescos
painted
in
churches
long
since
swept
away
and
elaborates
punctilious
appreciations
of
artists
and
architects
known
only
to
biographical
dictionaries
some
have
fancy
without
imagination
some
imagination
without
fancy
a
few
both
fancy
and
imagination
and
the
rest
neither
imagination
nor
fancy
the
stream
strewn
with
dead
names
flows
on
slow
and
stately
with
never
a
playful
eddy
and
another
man
greatly
daring
fortified
by
the
example
of
his
gallant
predecessors
steals
from
the
room
and
blushes
to
find
it
fame
amid
the
plaudits
that
ring
around
this
manful
deed
matt
suddenly
finds
herbert
at
his
side
his
cousin
slips
a
note
into
his
hand
and
retreats
hastily
to
his
place
excited
and
glad
of
the
relief
he
opens
it
and
reads
me
outside
after
this
rot
is
over
let
the
old
gentleman
see
matt
smiles
proud
and
happy
to
resume
his
old
relations
with
the
hero
of
the
evening
and
pleased
to
find
the
ancient
password
of
old
supplementing
the
droll
dig
in
the
ribs
in
their
camaraderie
on
its
ancient
footing
in
his
eagerness
to
talk
to
herbert
again
and
to
congratulate
him
personally
the
presidential
oration
seems
to
him
duller
and
the
seat
more
adamantine
than
ever
he
strains
his
ears
to
catch
instead
the
babble
of
the
students
who
have
finally
given
up
any
pretence
of
interest
in
mediæval
flemish
cathedrals
his
eye
long
since
satiate
with
the
sight
of
the
celebrities
roves
again
over
the
faces
of
the
academicians
on
their
platform
austere
in
their
striving
to
appear
absorbed
and
again
he
draws
confidence
from
their
merely
human
aspect
he
watches
the
popular
novelist
gossiping
with
the
vivacious
lady
journalist
he
examines
for
the
eighth
time
the
on
the
walls
which
he
gathers
from
one
of
the
many
conversations
going
on
in
his
neighborhood
are
by
the
competitors
for
the
turner
prize
he
sees
that
the
newspaper
artist
in
the
row
in
front
of
him
has
given
up
sketching
and
gone
to
sleep
despairing
of
escape
the
pangs
of
his
own
stomach
keep
him
awake
he
looks
forward
wistfully
to
the
hour
of
release
resolved
to
treat
himself
to
of
supper
in
honor
of
triumph
but
the
interminable
voice
goes
on
discoursing
learnedly
and
elegantly
of
apses
and
groins
and
gargoyles
the
wrigglings
have
ceased
all
around
but
especially
in
the
quiet
front
rows
under
the
presidential
eye
apathetic
listless
beings
droop
on
their
chairs
matt
steals
a
glance
towards
his
uncle
and
finds
him
the
only
member
of
the
audience
genuinely
alert
and
interested
his
head
perked
up
his
eyes
gazing
admiringly
towards
the
rostrum
where
perchance
in
imagination
he
already
sees
his
son
carrying
on
the
tradition
of
the
great
sir
joshua
at
his
side
madame
sustains
herself
by
furtive
looks
in
the
direction
of
the
same
young
gentleman
then
matt
turns
his
attention
to
the
speaker
watching
his
mouth
open
and
shut
and
his
shapely
hand
turning
the
perpetual
pages
he
expects
that
every
moment
will
be
the
last
but
the
great
man
is
just
warming
to
his
work
his
silvery
voice
rising
above
the
buzz
and
the
murmur
descants
dreamily
on
the
spiritual
aspirations
of
uncouthly
christened
architects
who
had
mouldered
in
their
graves
long
centuries
before
his
gracious
majesty
george
patron
of
arts
and
letters
gave
the
academy
after
an
hour
and
a
half
he
launches
lightly
into
a
treatise
on
the
audience
has
now
given
up
all
hope
it
has
the
sense
of
condemnation
to
an
earthly
inferno
in
which
the
suave
voice
of
a
fiend
of
torture
himself
everlastingly
damned
shall
forever
amble
on
unwinding
endless
erudition
a
reference
to
young
architectural
friends
greeted
with
suspicious
thunders
by
all
the
students
affords
a
momentary
break
in
the
monotony
the
end
comes
suddenly
after
a
forgotten
ten
minutes
before
there
is
a
brief
interval
of
incredulity
people
awakened
by
the
silence
look
up
sleepily
yes
there
is
no
doubt
the
president
is
actually
down
then
a
great
roar
of
joy
bursts
out
from
all
sides
the
back
benches
go
delirious
and
then
the
meeting
dissolves
in
a
stampede
towards
the
oaken
panels
at
last
open
in
three
places
the
discharged
prisoners
swarm
down
the
grand
staircase
and
besiege
the
some
parade
the
rooms
to
inspect
the
winning
pictures
now
ticketed
and
to
express
their
surprise
at
the
decisions
outside
in
the
cold
air
which
immediately
began
to
make
him
sneeze
through
the
compulsory
imprudence
of
having
worn
his
overcoat
throughout
matt
lurked
about
looking
for
herbert
and
at
last
the
hero
appeared
carefully
muffled
and
wrapped
up
and
with
a
murmur
of
it
awful
wait
by
the
arcade
till
my
cab
rolls
off
dashed
back
when
he
reappeared
smiling
sunnily
he
explained
that
he
had
told
his
people
he
must
show
up
at
the
club
in
order
not
to
appear
caddish
been
slobbered
over
enough
he
added
whimsically
flicking
the
traces
of
an
imaginary
maternal
kiss
off
his
fresh
smooth
cheek
but
i
wonder
your
people
are
delighted
said
matt
know
i
am
i
congratulated
you
and
he
shook
his
hand
heartily
you
old
fellow
very
good
of
you
oh
mention
to
anybody
i
let
you
see
the
picture
on
the
easel
will
you
one
is
supposed
to
keep
it
to
self
you
know
why
i
tell
you
i
was
doing
it
for
the
gold
who
should
i
mention
it
to
asked
matt
reassuringly
a
good
chap
you
see
if
it
got
out
that
i
talked
it
over
with
you
there
might
be
a
bother
people
are
so
jealous
especially
now
that
it
has
i
tell
a
soul
you
may
depend
said
matt
was
very
good
of
you
to
let
me
come
so
often
and
chat
about
it
and
even
if
i
did
save
you
a
little
trouble
in
working
out
the
perspective
i
learned
a
great
deal
about
composition
from
mention
it
said
herbert
i
said
matt
gravely
whereat
herbert
laughed
and
replied
must
do
an
academy
picture
old
fellow
three
time
there
be
any
chance
of
my
getting
in
asked
matt
wistfully
he
had
been
fluttered
by
the
applause
of
the
evening
it
seemed
impossibly
grand
to
be
the
centre
of
an
admiring
fashionable
assemblage
instead
of
a
shabby
alien
hovering
on
its
outside
rim
in
such
company
the
colossal
of
his
solitary
exaltations
dwindled
to
a
pitiful
sense
of
his
real
insignificance
replied
herbert
i
thank
my
stars
you
a
competitor
i
should
never
have
got
the
medal
if
you
had
matt
shook
his
head
deprecatingly
but
herbert
rattled
on
with
increasing
enthusiasm
it
be
jolly
if
you
got
a
picture
in
and
it
was
hung
on
the
line
next
to
mine
now
that
taught
you
composition
and
educated
you
up
to
the
ideas
you
could
easily
do
something
that
would
take
the
old
fancy
and
then
once
you
got
a
show
in
the
academy
the
old
gentleman
would
take
up
your
work
and
run
think
take
what
i
wanted
to
but
you
want
to
do
it
said
herbert
least
not
till
you
can
afford
it
besides
not
so
sure
that
there
something
in
the
ideas
after
all
candidly
i
quite
see
how
daniel
and
nebuchadnezzar
could
have
been
treated
any
want
to
treat
them
at
all
said
matt
anyway
do
something
you
old
duffer
you
want
to
go
grubbing
along
at
ten
bob
a
week
or
was
it
tenpence
a
day
i
forget
promise
me
to
do
a
picture
for
the
next
show
or
i
feel
easy
in
my
mind
about
promise
matt
murmured
right
said
herbert
considerably
relieved
he
went
on
heartily
academy
is
the
no
good
kicking
it
out
of
the
way
put
a
picture
in
the
academy
by
fair
means
if
thou
canst
but
put
a
picture
in
the
academy
you
see
even
cornpepper
had
to
come
to
us
and
even
if
you
do
stuff
you
can
always
get
in
if
you
make
the
picture
a
certain
queer
size
just
to
fit
an
awkward
corner
i
forget
the
exact
measurements
but
the
old
gentleman
knows
he
took
care
to
find
out
in
case
i
get
in
legitimately
make
a
point
of
asking
him
poor
old
governor
i
suppose
sleep
why
he
was
quite
blubbery
when
the
cab
drove
off
do
you
know
a
certain
pathos
about
the
old
been
very
good
to
you
said
matt
and
now
he
is
happy
virtue
rewarded
the
cream
of
the
joke
is
that
now
got
to
go
abroad
in
spite
of
him
travelling
studentship
you
see
and
he
possibly
chuck
business
for
a
year
to
come
with
the
money
in
that
envelope
matt
asked
the
first
quarterly
instalment
what
a
shame
i
pay
you
out
of
that
only
i
must
study
abroad
with
the
money
it
be
honest
to
use
it
for
any
other
purpose
would
it
talk
of
it
said
matt
flushing
from
a
sense
of
the
misconstruction
of
his
thoughtless
query
be
so
shocked
you
look
as
if
i
had
already
misappropriated
it
i
tell
you
how
glad
i
was
to
see
your
dear
old
phiz
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
i
often
wondered
why
you
look
me
up
at
the
club
here
we
are
at
the
echoed
matt
interrogatively
they
had
been
walking
automatically
as
they
conversed
and
had
come
to
a
before
a
blank
cheerless
building
in
golden
square
this
is
the
shanty
not
club
you
duffer
this
is
only
the
little
ken
i
told
my
people
the
truth
you
know
it
be
snobbish
not
to
drop
in
they
make
rather
a
night
of
it
though
i
intended
to
go
otherwise
hang
it
all
i
had
an
appointment
to
sup
with
a
girl
at
ten
i
forgot
all
about
her
be
he
took
out
his
watch
past
eleven
why
ecclesiastical
art
must
have
evolved
till
close
on
eleven
it
my
fault
anyhow
do
you
mind
trotting
round
to
the
imperial
in
the
first
ballet
better
have
a
the
young
men
drove
round
to
the
stage
door
but
the
fair
one
had
departed
after
a
few
impatient
instants
think
i
heard
her
tell
the
cabby
was
the
sixpenny
worth
of
information
obtained
from
the
janitor
go
there
said
matt
who
was
now
quite
faint
with
hunger
and
who
had
a
lurking
wish
that
herbert
would
stand
a
supper
one
of
the
olden
heroic
suppers
that
he
had
not
tasted
for
half
a
year
a
wild
riot
of
a
supper
with
real
meat
and
wholesome
vegetables
and
goodly
sauces
nay
even
red
wine
and
a
crowning
cup
of
coffee
made
of
real
beans
not
the
charred
crust
of
loaves
out
of
which
he
had
been
making
his
own
lately
getting
the
burned
bread
cheaper
with
a
double
economy
a
supper
fit
for
gods
which
a
starving
man
having
eaten
might
be
well
content
to
die
but
herbert
unaware
of
what
was
going
on
in
inner
man
replied
cruelly
too
late
to
look
for
her
at
the
restaurant
i
know
her
address
but
she
be
there
yet
besides
i
ought
to
show
up
at
the
so
they
strolled
back
to
the
bleak
building
matt
suddenly
bethinking
himself
that
even
here
supper
might
lie
in
wait
and
passing
through
a
dark
hall
mounted
a
stone
corkscrew
staircase
that
led
to
a
hubbub
of
voices
and
a
piano
jingling
tunes
the
doorway
of
the
first
room
was
congested
by
black
backs
with
clouds
of
smoke
herbert
and
matt
peered
in
unseen
for
a
few
moments
the
little
room
decorated
only
by
a
few
sketches
from
the
hands
of
members
and
separated
from
the
second
room
by
the
primitive
partition
of
a
screen
was
crowded
with
young
men
in
evening
dress
sitting
round
on
chairs
or
knees
or
with
glasses
in
their
hands
and
cigars
in
their
mouths
and
new
men
were
squeezing
in
from
the
inner
room
the
advent
of
each
being
greeted
by
facetious
cheers
plaudits
more
genuine
in
their
ring
welcomed
flinders
who
it
was
understood
had
been
in
the
final
running
he
came
in
trying
to
make
his
naturally
long
face
look
short
and
exclaiming
with
punctilious
carelessness
my
whiskey
rands
who
it
was
whispered
had
lost
by
only
a
few
votes
was
not
present
he
had
apparently
gone
home
to
the
gentility
at
dalston
matt
caught
sight
of
cornpepper
on
the
right
of
the
doorway
and
his
heart
rejoiced
as
at
the
sight
of
a
laid
supper
the
little
painter
was
clutching
the
middle
of
his
chair
with
his
most
expression
his
single
glittered
in
the
gaslight
cornpepper
matt
whispered
in
awed
accents
has
he
come
in
yawned
herbert
saw
him
marching
greme
about
among
the
daniels
and
giving
them
hell
in
emulation
of
clinch
looking
round
after
every
swear
as
if
half
hoping
the
ladies
heard
him
and
half
hoping
they
but
matt
had
only
half
heard
herbert
he
was
listening
to
the
oracles
of
cornpepper
but
listeners
rarely
hear
any
good
of
themselves
not
in
it
with
you
cornpepper
was
saying
to
flinders
no
blooming
style
in
his
technique
it
might
have
been
done
by
an
do
say
the
result
would
have
been
very
different
if
more
had
come
down
said
the
flinders
somewhat
illogically
barbauld
had
the
gout
and
platt
is
in
morocco
and
at
this
point
shouts
of
made
the
cousins
start
but
it
was
only
the
playfulness
of
the
room
greeting
a
as
the
victor
the
youth
acquiesced
humorously
in
the
slouching
round
the
room
with
a
comical
shuffle
and
a
bow
to
each
chair
then
a
man
got
up
and
began
a
burlesque
lecture
on
ecclesiastical
art
my
young
architectural
every
reference
to
apses
groins
or
gargoyles
was
received
with
yells
of
delight
a
demoniac
shriek
being
reserved
for
albrecht
dürer
awfully
glad
i
escaped
it
said
a
youth
in
front
of
matt
got
there
five
minutes
late
and
the
man
let
me
in
at
least
he
said
not
supposed
to
let
you
in
after
but
i
take
the
tip
or
give
in
the
middle
of
the
address
on
art
gurney
coming
up
the
staircase
in
the
wake
of
a
student
friend
to
whom
he
had
been
descanting
on
the
absurdities
of
cornpepperism
from
which
he
had
now
revolted
perceived
herbert
and
pushed
him
boisterously
into
the
room
which
straightway
became
a
pandemonium
the
pianist
banging
the
conquering
hero
comes
the
boys
stamping
singing
huzzahing
rattling
their
glasses
and
shouting
herbert
beamingly
ordered
boxes
of
havanas
and
and
soon
matt
still
in
his
overcoat
found
himself
drinking
and
smoking
and
shouting
with
the
rest
exalted
by
the
whiskey
into
forgetfulness
of
his
clothes
and
his
fortunes
and
partaking
in
all
the
rollicking
humors
of
the
evening
in
all
the
gayety
of
the
eternal
undergraduate
roaring
with
his
boon
companions
over
the
improper
stories
of
the
young
man
with
the
poetic
head
bawling
street
choruses
dancing
madly
in
grotesque
congested
waltzes
wherein
he
had
the
felicity
to
secure
cornpepper
for
a
partner
and
distinguishing
himself
in
the
not
departing
till
the
final
lang
had
been
sung
with
joined
hands
in
a
wildly
whirling
ring
herbert
had
left
some
time
before
matt
i
want
to
get
away
i
often
get
such
an
excuse
for
being
out
late
no
need
for
you
to
go
yet
you
lucky
beggar
he
whispered
confidentially
as
he
sallied
forth
radiantly
sober
weaving
joyous
dreams
of
his
travelling
studentship
future
when
the
party
broke
up
in
the
small
hours
matt
strang
saturated
with
whiskey
and
empty
of
victual
staggered
along
the
frosty
pavements
singing
to
the
stars
that
reeled
round
blinking
and
winking
like
the
buttons
on
boots
chapter
ix
defeat
his
own
boots
preoccupied
attention
ere
the
new
year
dawned
had
continued
going
to
instead
of
letting
his
subscription
lapse
perforce
with
the
christmas
quarter
he
might
have
convinced
the
class
that
his
toes
were
normal
for
they
had
begun
to
peep
out
despite
all
his
efforts
to
botch
up
the
seams
the
state
of
his
wardrobe
prevented
him
from
looking
up
herbert
at
his
club
especially
as
he
was
doubtful
whether
the
travelling
studentship
had
not
already
carried
his
cousin
off
and
thus
that
mad
night
which
was
a
hot
shame
to
sober
memory
grew
to
seem
an
unreal
nightmare
and
herbert
as
distant
as
ever
a
vagrant
atom
of
the
scum
of
the
city
he
tasted
all
the
bitterness
of
a
solitude
his
quest
for
work
was
the
more
hopeless
the
shabbier
his
appearance
grew
in
optimistic
moods
he
had
thought
the
spectacle
of
the
streets
sufficient
and
to
feast
eyes
on
the
pageant
of
life
a
cloyless
ecstasy
and
indeed
in
the
first
days
of
his
wanderings
the
merest
artistic
touch
in
the
wintry
streets
could
still
give
him
a
pleasurable
sensation
that
was
a
temporary
anodyne
the
yellow
sand
scattered
on
slippery
days
along
the
tram
lines
and
showing
like
a
spilth
of
summer
sunshine
the
warm
front
of
a
making
the
only
spot
of
color
in
the
long
suburban
street
strange
faces
seen
for
an
instant
in
fog
and
lost
forever
tumbling
over
one
another
in
their
haste
or
fluttering
lingeringly
to
earth
red
suns
like
taws
but
as
the
slow
days
unfolded
their
sordid
unchanging
coils
he
found
himself
shrinking
more
and
more
into
himself
he
sought
warmth
and
refuge
from
reality
in
the
national
gallery
or
the
british
museum
dreaming
away
the
hours
before
the
more
imaginative
pictures
or
the
elgin
marbles
but
even
these
failed
him
at
last
their
beauty
an
intolerable
irony
sometimes
he
realized
with
a
miserable
start
the
real
tragedy
of
being
of
work
how
it
narrowed
the
horizon
down
to
the
prospect
of
meals
so
that
the
great
movement
of
the
world
from
which
he
was
shut
out
left
him
equally
exclusive
and
the
announcements
on
the
newspaper
posters
wars
and
international
football
and
the
opening
of
parks
and
new
plays
and
the
deaths
of
great
men
and
the
rise
of
ministries
struck
no
responsive
chord
in
his
imagination
were
all
shadowy
emanations
from
some
unreal
mockery
of
a
universe
the
real
universe
had
his
own
navel
for
centre
sometimes
a
faint
perception
of
the
humor
of
the
position
distorted
his
lips
in
a
melancholy
smile
he
wondered
how
he
would
come
out
under
jimmy
pencil
at
other
times
he
lay
huddled
up
in
his
bed
his
fading
clothes
heaped
over
the
one
blanket
passing
the
day
in
an
apathetic
trance
interrupted
only
by
the
intermittent
working
of
his
imagination
or
by
observation
of
optical
effects
that
accidentally
arrested
his
gaze
and
the
next
day
in
remorse
for
lost
possibilities
he
would
rise
before
dawn
and
recommence
his
search
for
employment
from
such
a
long
tramp
he
was
shuffling
homeward
late
one
dark
dismal
night
when
pausing
to
warm
his
feet
and
hands
at
the
of
a
shop
he
was
accosted
by
william
gregson
striding
along
with
a
frown
on
his
forehead
and
a
parcel
in
his
hand
fourt
strang
he
cried
pausing
see
you
any
said
matt
wishing
gregson
see
him
now
and
edging
a
little
away
from
a
want
any
boots
said
matt
sticking
his
toes
downward
to
hide
the
gaps
as
far
as
possible
forget
i
am
at
your
service
whatever
you
want
said
the
little
stooping
old
man
with
shining
enthusiastic
eyes
is
a
pleasure
to
work
for
a
man
with
feet
like
yours
i
was
only
of
you
at
the
studio
a
scurvy
wretch
has
been
me
a
shabby
trick
and
i
was
to
myself
ah
four
ah
strang
a
difference
now
a
man
and
a
brother
artist
this
a
what
did
he
do
no
need
to
go
into
details
said
william
gregson
pathetically
it
to
say
he
refuses
the
boots
and
here
they
are
a
beautiful
pair
left
on
my
hands
after
i
sat
up
half
the
night
to
finish
for
him
so
brisk
just
he
unwrapped
the
package
to
expose
their
perfections
what
will
you
do
with
them
said
matt
like
to
put
on
and
kick
him
with
replied
gregson
gloomily
too
own
feet
were
decidedly
not
beautiful
they
seem
more
my
size
agreed
matt
you
have
them
cried
the
old
man
eagerly
your
own
price
be
afraid
i
ask
more
than
last
but
matt
shook
his
head
hard
up
he
confessed
blushing
in
the
lamplight
trust
you
was
the
fervid
response
never
pay
you
matt
protested
i
could
do
something
for
you
in
return
if
you
want
he
hesitated
shop
painted
or
any
or
or
i
could
build
you
a
counter
or
but
the
shoemaker
was
shaking
his
head
want
my
shop
painted
but
if
you
painted
me
he
cried
with
an
inspiration
often
tried
to
do
it
myself
but
an
angelic
expression
gets
into
it
and
the
missus
recognize
it
have
you
ever
tried
your
own
portrait
strang
not
seriously
said
matt
you
try
and
see
if
you
find
it
as
i
say
a
curious
thing
how
that
angelic
expression
will
creep
in
when
a
his
own
portrait
besides
you
can
paint
better
than
me
i
say
it
behind
your
back
but
a
bargain
interrupted
matt
anxiously
i
can
give
you
an
hour
every
so
slack
i
take
the
boots
with
me
inquired
matt
the
moment
the
done
said
gregson
in
generous
accents
you
afraid
walk
off
in
matt
cried
angrily
suppose
they
fit
well
you
may
try
them
on
conceded
gregson
and
with
a
curious
repetition
of
a
former
episode
matt
slipped
off
his
boot
under
a
the
boots
were
a
little
tight
especially
after
the
yawning
laxness
of
the
old
but
it
was
heavenly
to
stamp
on
the
wet
pavement
and
to
feel
a
solid
sole
under
foot
even
though
an
oozy
sloppy
stocking
intervened
gregson
perceived
the
ruin
of
the
vacant
boot
and
his
face
grew
stern
it
on
keep
it
on
he
said
harshly
an
old
thank
you
ejaculated
matt
can
give
me
the
old
pair
he
rejoined
gruffly
but
past
mending
said
matt
they
can
help
to
mend
other
boots
like
clergymen
said
the
little
shoemaker
laughing
grimly
is
ever
wasted
in
this
matt
was
thinking
so
too
though
from
a
different
point
of
view
he
was
grateful
to
the
economical
order
of
the
universe
the
boots
reinvigorated
the
pilgrim
on
his
way
to
the
mecca
of
employment
and
each
day
he
sallied
forth
further
refreshed
by
the
bread
and
butter
and
tea
which
william
spouse
dispensed
after
the
sittings
all
over
london
he
tramped
one
day
he
wandered
in
hopes
of
a
job
among
the
docks
of
rotherhithe
feeling
a
vague
romance
in
the
great
gray
perspectives
of
towering
with
their
flavor
of
exotic
forests
and
in
the
sombre
canals
and
locks
along
which
men
with
cordwain
faces
were
tugging
discolored
barges
the
desolation
of
the
scene
and
of
the
district
was
akin
to
his
mood
his
eyes
were
full
of
delicious
hopeless
tears
he
rambled
on
forgetting
to
ask
for
the
job
through
the
forlorn
streets
all
shops
and
cottages
and
threading
a
narrow
passage
strewn
with
lounging
louts
found
himself
on
a
little
floating
pier
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
lost
himself
again
in
contemplating
the
grimy
picturesque
traffic
the
bleak
wharves
and
warehouses
see
that
air
barge
with
the
sails
matt
started
an
aged
gentleman
with
a
rusty
silk
hat
was
addressing
him
day
i
see
one
just
like
that
capsize
in
calm
weather
under
my
very
eyes
i
come
here
every
day
after
dinner
to
watch
the
water
and
i
do
get
something
worth
sometimes
the
he
told
me
it
was
loaded
with
and
alive
shifts
the
weight
on
the
side
you
see
and
it
occurred
there
was
two
men
drowned
oh
worth
while
coming
here
sometimes
i
can
tell
you
you
see
that
green
flag
off
the
buoy
where
she
lays
right
in
the
fairway
of
the
here
the
aged
gentleman
snuffed
himself
with
tremulous
fingers
that
spilled
half
and
offered
matt
the
box
the
young
man
took
a
pinch
for
exhilaration
a
strayed
sparrow
hopped
dolefully
amid
the
grains
of
snuff
on
the
floating
platform
in
futile
quest
of
seeds
would
be
stuffed
the
aged
gentleman
declared
mean
with
tow
not
and
he
laughed
wheezingly
matt
contesting
this
the
aged
gentleman
maintained
with
an
air
of
deep
philosophy
that
all
birds
would
be
stuffed
that
their
life
in
a
state
of
nature
was
a
harrowing
competition
for
crumbs
and
worms
while
to
keep
them
alive
in
cages
was
the
climax
of
cruelty
it
subsequently
transpired
that
he
was
a
retired
and
the
conversation
ended
in
accompanying
him
home
to
learn
the
process
as
the
son
and
heir
in
stepney
was
in
need
of
a
trustworthy
hand
in
the
shop
a
honest
in
the
trade
he
said
gloomily
the
boys
are
wuss
than
the
men
they
ought
to
be
stuffed
what
i
like
about
you
is
that
got
no
character
the
better
the
character
the
wuss
the
man
they
takes
advantage
of
arrived
at
his
house
which
was
more
pretentious
than
most
of
its
neighbors
for
it
had
a
basement
sublet
to
a
blind
woman
whose
insignia
read
neatly
cained
on
reasonable
terms
and
its
parlor
window
was
gay
with
wax
fruits
and
stuffed
birds
the
aged
gentleman
who
gave
the
name
of
ground
discovered
that
he
had
no
skin
to
operate
on
and
being
spent
from
the
walk
directed
matt
to
buy
a
dead
canary
for
sixpence
from
a
the
eye
the
tanner
he
said
if
you
come
back
with
the
bird
you
may
stuff
me
for
a
old
matt
came
back
with
the
bird
but
the
aged
gentleman
put
it
to
his
nose
and
contorted
his
aged
nostrils
want
a
bird
not
manure
he
said
bird
fresh
from
this
wale
of
tears
why
if
i
began
to
skin
this
the
feathers
drop
out
been
took
in
but
you
took
me
in
so
another
in
great
anxiety
matt
stood
outside
the
staring
wistfully
at
the
birds
roosting
in
the
cages
and
hoping
that
some
kindly
canary
would
drop
off
to
eternal
sleep
under
his
very
nose
so
that
he
might
be
sure
of
its
freshness
but
the
poor
little
creatures
all
clung
to
existence
and
their
perches
suddenly
he
began
to
laugh
there
was
an
owl
in
a
cage
and
it
looked
like
cornpepper
on
its
head
was
an
erectile
tuft
like
hair
after
argument
and
though
devoid
of
an
the
creature
regarded
him
from
its
great
eyes
with
the
same
large
profound
gaze
me
style
he
heard
it
saying
me
and
then
he
thought
of
theories
of
which
he
had
heard
more
on
that
glad
mad
night
when
the
juvenile
celebrity
had
been
his
partner
in
the
waltz
is
all
wrong
cornpepper
had
pronounced
testily
i
want
to
talk
shop
imagination
is
shown
in
treatment
not
in
subject
there
may
be
more
imagination
in
the
painting
of
a
than
of
an
allegory
painters
are
called
poets
when
they
paint
and
the
is
quite
at
sea
when
it
claims
me
as
the
champion
of
modern
subject
against
ancient
mediæval
or
imaginary
subject
indeed
what
i
demand
is
modern
i
do
wish
would
leave
off
interpreting
and
matt
strang
fell
into
a
reverie
wondering
what
he
should
paint
for
the
academy
and
gazing
into
the
eyes
what
if
he
were
destined
to
waltz
to
fame
in
company
with
cornpepper
and
then
he
remembered
enthusiastic
talk
during
the
pauses
of
the
wild
waltz
in
denunciation
of
the
of
cornpepperism
and
in
acclamation
of
the
simpler
harmonies
of
outamaro
the
great
japanese
master
from
whose
work
was
a
rotten
retrogression
rather
than
a
legitimate
evolution
matt
speculatively
surrendered
his
fancy
to
japanese
images
a
gallery
of
beautiful
passed
before
his
eyes
like
a
panorama
a
brusque
tap
on
the
shoulder
roused
him
from
his
and
turning
he
saw
the
animated
face
of
the
aged
gentleman
beneath
the
rusty
silk
hat
the
bird
cried
mr
ground
relieved
to
find
matt
not
run
off
for
during
the
suspense
of
waiting
it
had
struck
him
that
even
the
first
bird
might
have
been
picked
up
in
the
gutter
bird
matt
murmured
dazedly
ah
i
was
waiting
for
one
to
die
i
wanted
to
be
sure
it
was
my
little
eye
i
sore
die
quoted
the
aged
gentleman
mockingly
give
us
the
cash
a
juggins
but
i
suppose
folks
be
honest
and
clever
he
took
the
sixpence
and
went
inside
and
with
what
he
called
a
linnet
and
returning
to
his
parlor
skinned
it
and
smeared
the
skin
with
arsenical
soap
which
he
manufactured
on
the
spot
out
of
common
yellow
soap
beaten
up
into
a
batter
with
water
white
arsenic
and
some
drops
of
toothache
mixture
he
had
in
a
vial
he
stuffed
the
skin
with
the
in
which
the
vial
was
embedded
and
ran
a
wire
right
through
from
mouth
to
tail
with
half
a
for
each
leg
and
each
wing
out
of
eyes
he
said
pausing
in
them
sockets
you
sticks
glass
eyes
so
much
a
dozen
according
to
size
see
aptitude
as
a
pupil
regained
him
the
aged
esteem
and
a
day
or
so
after
the
oddly
assorted
couple
sailed
down
the
thames
on
a
penny
steamboat
and
walked
from
blackwall
to
stepney
where
matt
was
introduced
to
the
son
a
fat
greasy
hilarious
man
who
told
his
father
that
he
was
old
innercent
and
facetiously
argued
out
the
probabilities
of
honesty
in
presence
ultimately
ground
junior
took
the
young
man
on
a
trial
the
trial
going
in
favor
he
was
installed
permanently
in
the
establishment
at
eighteen
shillings
a
week
fulfilling
miscellaneous
functions
the
most
troublesome
of
which
was
the
superintendence
of
a
who
played
excruciatingly
on
a
penny
whistle
this
boy
whose
name
was
tommy
and
who
reminded
matt
queerly
of
his
ancient
indian
chum
by
his
dishonesty
as
well
as
by
his
name
would
calmly
return
with
bare
pedestals
where
there
had
been
birds
and
shades
and
assert
that
he
had
smashed
the
glass
and
that
thieves
in
the
crowd
had
torn
off
the
birds
he
did
not
flinch
from
smashing
whole
nests
of
glass
shades
two
dozen
inside
one
another
a
veritable
napoleon
among
sometimes
when
he
had
been
out
with
the
barrow
delivering
orders
he
would
wheel
it
home
laden
with
mysterious
coats
and
boots
which
he
vainly
offered
matt
on
easy
terms
at
irregular
intervals
too
he
fell
ill
a
note
from
his
mother
arriving
in
his
handwriting
differently
sloped
and
then
matt
was
reduced
to
trundling
the
barrow
himself
while
the
fat
facetious
man
summoned
from
the
workroom
over
the
shop
or
from
his
other
establishment
in
the
new
cut
where
his
wiry
vixen
of
a
wife
had
her
headquarters
replaced
him
behind
the
counter
matt
had
also
spells
of
mechanical
occupation
in
the
workshop
he
not
only
stuffed
the
skins
which
came
from
abroad
but
arranged
baskets
of
which
were
bought
and
paper
flowers
and
cases
of
shells
with
moss
and
and
pyramids
of
pebbles
and
he
made
mock
red
coral
out
of
balls
of
brown
paper
dipped
into
a
hot
composition
of
beeswax
and
rosin
and
stuck
it
on
wooden
stands
with
shells
variegating
it
and
preserved
insects
creeping
prettily
over
it
likewise
he
manufactured
to
replace
breakages
hollow
frauds
mere
wax
shells
pounced
with
dry
colors
or
mixed
originally
with
coloring
matter
yellow
ochre
making
apples
and
lake
lending
transparency
to
cherries
or
uniting
with
prussian
blue
to
furnish
the
florid
richness
of
purple
grapes
but
though
as
ever
his
taskwork
hovered
oddly
about
the
purlieus
of
art
or
the
vaults
of
its
temple
and
though
his
eighteen
shillings
a
week
enabled
him
to
send
nine
shillings
a
week
home
in
monthly
instalments
to
abner
preep
still
he
was
not
happy
the
difficulties
with
the
the
fat
facetiousness
of
ground
junior
the
menial
trundling
of
the
barrow
with
the
dread
of
some
day
meeting
or
other
fellows
from
to
say
nothing
of
cornpepper
gurney
rapper
or
the
old
gentleman
the
retail
trade
over
the
counter
the
biweekly
task
of
cleaning
all
the
shades
with
a
chamois
leather
all
this
combined
with
the
sense
of
wasted
months
galled
and
fretted
him
he
was
working
at
his
academy
picture
now
in
accordance
with
his
promise
to
herbert
but
his
hours
being
from
eight
to
eight
sunday
was
his
only
leisure
time
and
he
was
paradoxically
grateful
for
the
ancient
oriental
ordinance
which
made
the
godless
british
close
his
shop
once
a
week
and
thus
enable
him
to
work
he
was
able
to
do
some
of
the
preliminary
in
the
early
morning
and
at
night
but
there
was
no
light
for
the
real
work
nor
was
there
much
light
in
his
back
bedroom
even
at
noon
on
sundays
he
had
not
changed
his
address
though
he
had
to
walk
three
miles
to
and
from
his
work
kept
to
his
old
lodging
by
habit
and
the
trust
that
his
landlady
an
mother
would
not
hastily
throw
him
upon
the
streets
the
subject
of
his
picture
had
grown
upon
him
from
his
daily
occupation
the
simulated
around
him
moved
him
at
moments
to
thoughts
of
the
joyous
winged
creatures
butchered
to
make
a
parlor
ornament
he
could
not
agree
with
ground
senior
that
they
were
happier
stuffed
and
then
too
the
pathos
of
prisoned
birds
would
overwhelm
him
exiled
from
their
natural
woodland
home
and
set
to
peck
endlessly
at
wires
his
own
lot
and
theirs
became
subtly
interlinked
and
his
imagination
turning
from
the
sordid
prose
of
the
actual
world
in
which
he
found
himself
brooded
on
visions
of
poetry
and
idyllic
happiness
and
so
instead
of
selecting
from
reality
that
which
was
beautiful
in
it
instead
of
following
theories
or
his
own
theories
or
theories
he
found
himself
irresistibly
and
instinctively
seized
and
possessed
by
a
subject
and
a
mode
of
treatment
uncompromisingly
imaginative
paradise
of
the
birds
a
beautiful
wood
suffused
with
a
magic
sunlight
in
which
freed
birds
of
many
species
should
flutter
blithely
around
a
divine
female
figure
with
a
wondrous
radiance
of
love
and
joy
upon
her
welcoming
face
and
at
her
feet
a
beautiful
boy
playing
upon
an
oaten
pipe
there
should
be
an
undertone
of
tender
pathos
the
pathos
of
birds
but
light
and
joy
were
to
be
the
essence
of
this
harmony
of
lovely
forms
and
colors
all
the
yearning
for
happiness
all
his
revolt
against
his
narrow
squalid
lot
his
secret
resentful
sense
of
the
high
place
denied
him
at
the
banquet
of
life
reflecting
themselves
inverted
in
the
mirror
of
his
art
and
though
the
sunlight
and
atmosphere
should
be
real
enough
to
satisfy
the
cornpepper
faction
yet
over
all
he
would
put
something
of
glamour
gleam
the
light
that
never
was
on
sea
or
land
the
consecration
and
the
for
the
paradise
matt
drew
on
his
recollections
and
old
sketches
of
acadia
supplemented
by
a
few
studies
made
in
epping
forest
which
was
within
difficult
walking
distance
of
the
from
which
of
course
he
got
his
birds
the
divine
female
figure
was
based
upon
his
first
study
from
the
nude
at
which
he
still
possessed
though
he
now
gave
the
woman
the
normal
allowance
of
toes
while
by
the
aid
of
coppers
he
bribed
the
apprentice
with
his
penny
whistle
to
sit
for
the
cherub
with
the
oaten
reed
and
thus
was
nature
transfigured
to
art
but
as
eden
to
epping
so
was
mental
conception
of
the
picture
to
the
real
picture
from
dawn
to
sunset
matt
painted
tirelessly
and
with
many
patient
effacements
and
substitutions
of
passages
during
his
one
convinced
that
the
academy
was
now
his
only
avenue
to
recognition
and
as
day
drew
nearer
and
the
precious
light
was
born
earlier
he
was
able
to
snatch
an
hour
or
two
every
morning
before
setting
out
for
stepney
towards
the
end
the
need
of
time
drove
him
to
the
omnibus
nor
was
it
only
the
need
of
time
of
late
a
strange
languor
had
grown
upon
him
against
which
he
was
incessantly
battling
the
image
in
his
strip
of
glass
frightened
him
his
face
was
white
his
once
sturdy
frame
thin
and
so
feeble
was
he
become
that
the
walk
which
had
been
rather
a
pleasure
than
an
inconvenience
was
now
a
weary
endless
drag
he
had
bilious
headaches
but
he
toiled
on
at
his
picture
finding
in
the
fairyland
of
imagination
consolation
for
existence
and
in
the
anxieties
and
agonies
of
artistic
travail
an
antidote
to
the
agonies
and
anxieties
of
the
daily
grind
paradise
of
the
birds
though
he
was
conscious
it
did
not
equal
his
conception
still
seemed
to
him
far
superior
to
the
ordinary
academy
picture
it
could
not
fail
to
redeem
him
from
his
own
inferno
reveal
him
to
the
world
make
him
an
honored
guest
in
artistic
coteries
and
give
him
all
the
day
for
art
through
the
sordid
life
of
stepney
and
whitechapel
he
moved
sustained
by
an
inner
vision
of
beauty
and
victory
and
it
was
not
till
he
had
surreptitiously
wheeled
his
picture
to
burlington
house
in
the
barrow
at
the
price
of
a
reprimand
for
idling
about
that
his
gave
way
and
he
realized
that
he
was
but
a
limp
shadow
hope
kept
him
on
his
feet
a
little
longer
but
the
terrifying
symptoms
developed
rapidly
and
at
last
even
ground
junior
perceived
his
condition
and
allowed
him
a
leave
to
attend
a
hospital
for
two
hours
and
a
half
he
waited
on
one
of
the
bare
benches
of
a
cheerless
anteroom
amid
a
grimy
crowd
of
invalids
ranging
from
decrepit
bandaged
old
men
to
children
all
coughing
and
groaning
and
conversing
fatuously
and
ostentatiously
comparing
complaints
and
finally
fading
away
tediously
two
by
two
into
the
presence
of
the
physician
at
last
his
own
turn
came
announced
by
the
sharp
ting
of
a
and
preceded
by
a
he
passed
through
the
polished
portal
and
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
an
austere
gentleman
with
frosty
the
matter
with
you
my
man
the
doctor
inquired
in
low
tones
of
the
outer
sorts
replied
the
any
special
pain
anywhere
he
went
on
in
the
same
dulcet
accents
asked
the
hearing
imperfectly
in
his
fluster
the
doctor
shouted
in
a
mighty
yell
special
pain
anywhere
the
appalled
admitted
to
a
stitch
in
the
side
and
the
doctor
continued
his
interrogative
thunders
he
had
only
two
conversational
methods
the
piano
and
the
fortissimo
matt
trembling
awaited
his
succession
to
the
criminal
dock
and
straining
his
ears
when
the
trying
moment
came
was
fortunate
enough
to
secure
the
piano
treatment
blood
is
poisoned
was
the
great
verdict
is
the
third
case
i
have
had
from
establishments
when
you
clean
the
glass
shades
and
breathe
on
the
insides
you
imbibe
the
arsenical
and
other
foul
gases
that
are
given
off
by
the
skins
and
collect
inside
the
glasses
you
will
take
the
medicine
three
times
a
day
but
it
do
you
any
good
if
you
go
on
living
in
that
atmosphere
you
want
you
ought
to
try
and
get
into
the
country
and
have
a
little
and
matt
strang
dazed
but
smiling
grimly
crawled
down
into
the
dispensary
and
handed
in
his
prescription
and
tottered
back
to
the
with
a
big
bottle
of
yellow
fluid
in
his
hand
he
would
not
let
himself
think
there
was
only
one
point
of
light
his
academy
picture
and
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
that
as
on
a
star
a
few
days
later
the
notice
of
rejection
arrived
and
the
thin
sickly
faced
young
man
being
out
with
orders
surreptitiously
wheeled
paradise
of
the
home
on
his
barrow
and
discounted
the
renewed
wrath
of
his
employer
by
giving
a
notice
he
did
his
work
as
usual
that
afternoon
smiling
in
uneasy
defiance
at
the
oddly
intrusive
thought
that
the
cobequid
folks
would
have
said
it
was
all
through
his
painting
on
sundays
yet
not
without
a
shred
of
their
superstition
but
when
he
got
home
he
fell
helplessly
on
his
little
iron
bed
and
wept
like
a
child
he
was
beaten
broken
shattered
in
body
and
soul
he
had
fought
and
lost
and
as
an
ailing
child
turns
yearningly
to
its
mother
so
his
heart
yearned
to
his
native
land
in
a
great
surge
of
homesickness
here
the
narrow
labyrinthine
streets
were
muddy
with
spring
rains
but
there
the
snow
would
still
be
on
the
fields
and
forests
white
and
pure
and
beautiful
under
the
dazzling
blue
sky
oh
the
keen
tingling
cold
the
large
embrace
of
the
salt
breezes
the
joy
of
skating
over
the
frozen
flats
his
poor
poisoned
blood
glowed
at
the
thought
here
he
was
ill
and
lonely
there
he
would
be
among
loving
faces
poor
billy
how
the
boy
must
long
for
him
it
would
be
humiliating
to
return
a
failure
but
there
would
be
none
to
reproach
him
and
his
own
pride
was
gone
vanished
with
his
physical
strength
but
how
to
get
back
he
was
too
ill
to
go
before
the
mast
too
impoverished
to
command
even
the
steerage
he
had
unfortunately
sent
shillings
home
just
before
the
rejection
of
his
picture
and
he
was
again
in
arrears
of
rent
through
the
extra
expense
of
the
canvas
and
the
compulsory
gilt
frame
lipchild
was
induced
by
the
splendor
of
the
frame
to
take
paradise
of
the
in
payment
for
the
three
weeks
lunar
and
the
and
gilder
and
in
red
lion
street
who
had
made
the
frame
purchased
all
his
remaining
pictures
and
for
a
sovereign
down
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
borrow
so
feeble
was
his
whole
being
that
the
first
suggestion
of
this
ignominy
carried
no
sting
he
thought
first
of
herbert
and
brushing
his
garments
to
a
threadbare
specklessness
inquired
of
his
club
who
informed
him
curtly
that
strang
was
abroad
this
was
as
he
expected
but
he
was
disappointed
tarmigan
was
his
only
other
friend
but
him
he
had
lost
sight
of
since
christmas
and
though
he
had
in
these
hours
of
weakness
abandoned
the
hope
of
art
he
had
still
a
vague
paradoxical
aversion
from
applying
to
a
man
whose
artistic
ideas
he
did
not
share
and
who
might
hereafter
have
a
sort
of
right
to
resent
his
departure
from
them
besides
tarmigan
was
poor
was
unsuccessful
in
his
desperation
he
thought
of
madame
strang
and
though
in
the
course
of
their
chat
that
night
at
the
club
herbert
had
told
him
the
old
gentleman
had
given
her
an
awful
wigging
and
she
had
renewed
her
promise
to
close
her
door
in
the
face
yet
matt
nerved
himself
to
risk
insult
so
spying
the
shop
from
a
sheltered
doorway
across
the
street
he
hung
about
till
the
vandyke
beard
and
the
velvet
jacket
had
issued
and
disappeared
round
a
corner
then
he
rang
the
bell
of
the
side
door
and
to
his
joy
madame
herself
opened
it
poor
boy
what
is
the
matter
with
you
she
cried
the
unexpected
sympathy
of
her
words
clouded
the
lonely
young
gaze
with
hot
tears
he
staggered
into
the
passage
and
madame
growing
pale
herself
took
him
by
the
arm
and
helped
him
into
the
and
in
her
agitation
poured
him
out
a
whole
tumblerful
of
brandy
which
fortunately
he
only
sipped
a
little
recovered
he
explained
improving
his
pallid
complexion
with
blushes
when
he
came
to
the
point
that
he
was
returning
to
nova
scotia
as
the
doctor
had
ordered
him
a
and
he
wanted
four
or
five
pounds
till
he
got
to
the
other
side
when
he
would
easily
be
able
to
repay
the
loan
my
poor
boy
certainly
said
madame
idea
of
clever
people
having
no
money
and
people
like
me
having
she
ran
and
returned
with
ten
of
the
sovereigns
that
she
hoarded
literally
in
her
stocking
but
matt
would
not
take
more
than
five
he
felt
it
foolish
to
burden
himself
with
superfluous
temptations
knew
you
a
rogue
cried
madame
in
thoughtless
triumph
the
sentiment
reminding
her
of
the
interrogative
eyebrows
she
added
hastily
course
you
tell
my
husband
not
that
he
would
mind
of
course
for
i
am
helping
you
to
leave
the
country
but
oh
how
i
wish
you
had
come
to
me
instead
of
to
herbert
the
dear
boy
has
such
hard
work
and
so
few
pleasures
and
his
allowance
is
so
small
that
his
father
was
naturally
annoyed
to
think
of
your
making
the
poor
boy
stint
himself
of
course
i
made
it
up
to
herbert
unbeknown
to
his
father
who
would
only
return
him
a
little
of
the
money
you
had
borrowed
promise
me
you
will
not
apply
to
herbert
again
you
know
it
is
so
expensive
living
in
paris
promise
matt
murmured
hardly
conscious
of
what
madame
was
saying
his
soul
already
in
nova
scotia
and
dissolved
in
tenderness
and
gratitude
the
prospect
of
leaving
london
was
as
delightful
as
the
prospect
of
coming
to
it
had
been
not
fifteen
months
ago
ere
he
bade
her
farewell
madame
made
him
promise
to
come
and
see
her
when
he
was
back
in
london
again
hoped
the
voyage
would
do
him
good
and
scolded
him
for
never
having
shown
her
his
pictures
am
sure
you
will
be
a
great
artist
she
said
smiling
winsomely
have
the
artistic
hand
god
bless
the
young
man
listened
unmoved
he
was
hoping
the
ice
would
bear
till
he
arrived
in
cobequid
village
and
so
with
all
his
worldly
goods
including
the
unsaleable
packed
in
the
smallest
of
satchels
matt
strang
sailed
back
across
the
atlantic
the
blood
clogged
in
his
veins
an
unregarded
unit
of
the
countless
myriads
that
london
has
allured
and
scorched
chapter
x
matt
receives
sundry
hospitalities
but
the
prodigal
son
was
not
fated
to
see
any
of
his
relatives
immediately
upon
his
return
to
his
native
land
except
his
mother
and
this
was
scarcely
his
mother
this
pale
creature
with
eyes
vacant
of
all
save
tears
who
babbled
to
him
with
verbal
repetitions
of
revelation
and
the
beast
not
even
mistaking
him
for
his
dead
father
she
had
survived
her
life
from
halifax
matt
did
not
proceed
forthwith
to
cobequid
village
joining
instead
a
crew
of
in
the
hope
of
earning
enough
to
repay
madame
strang
immediately
for
his
soul
reinvigorated
by
the
of
the
voyage
and
the
skies
of
his
childhood
had
returned
to
its
healthy
repugnance
to
debt
and
was
ashamed
of
its
lapse
it
was
a
mixed
company
that
he
sailed
away
with
the
bulk
decent
nova
scotians
of
old
fisher
stock
but
some
rougher
and
more
casual
and
a
few
though
these
were
harmless
enough
despised
the
fishing
was
not
devoid
of
danger
the
men
had
to
row
out
from
the
schooner
in
twos
or
threes
to
tend
the
nets
spread
on
the
mackerel
banks
and
sometimes
a
fog
would
come
on
and
ingulf
the
ship
and
the
fishers
with
their
mocking
freight
would
row
for
hours
and
hours
and
at
times
for
days
and
days
on
the
ghostly
sea
in
search
of
their
floating
home
and
sometimes
they
too
would
be
swallowed
up
in
the
mystery
of
sea
and
fog
and
wives
and
mothers
running
anxiously
to
the
wharf
to
meet
them
would
learn
that
an
older
fisher
had
netted
his
prey
to
matt
the
hard
work
and
the
peril
were
alike
welcome
the
very
mists
were
poetry
after
the
yellow
vapors
of
london
which
now
lay
behind
him
like
a
nightmare
and
with
it
his
dream
of
art
his
soul
had
swung
round
violently
in
the
strain
of
hauling
up
the
nets
in
the
misty
moonlight
in
the
silence
of
sea
and
sky
and
night
he
found
repose
from
his
morbid
craving
to
reproduce
this
mighty
nature
which
stretched
away
all
around
him
in
large
sane
serenity
as
indifferent
to
the
puny
images
of
art
as
the
waste
of
waters
to
the
little
dory
rocking
on
its
bosom
and
the
rugged
simplicity
of
his
briny
mates
was
equally
restful
after
the
garish
brilliance
of
the
young
artists
about
town
after
all
his
heart
was
with
homely
folk
went
out
to
he
was
his
son
and
the
brother
of
all
those
who
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
and
do
business
in
the
great
waters
how
like
a
cackle
epigrams
sounded
across
the
silence
of
the
lonely
deep
under
the
hushed
stars
touching
the
infinite
spaces
with
awful
beauty
all
these
feverish
figures
of
the
showed
like
fretful
midges
when
the
cruise
was
over
and
the
spoil
had
been
unloaded
and
sold
on
the
fishy
wharf
or
steeped
in
brine
and
packed
in
the
vats
matt
was
able
to
send
ten
dollars
to
england
besides
keeping
up
his
usual
allowance
to
cobequid
village
and
maintaining
himself
a
triple
task
which
weighed
heavily
upon
his
brain
and
gave
him
frequent
moments
of
corroding
nervous
apprehension
for
his
health
was
only
partially
and
his
correspondence
with
cobequid
village
was
not
reassuring
his
brothers
and
sisters
were
growing
up
without
finding
much
to
do
billy
moped
a
great
deal
and
though
he
thanked
his
brother
for
the
engraving
of
the
which
matt
sent
him
he
intimated
that
he
would
have
been
better
pleased
had
matt
spent
his
money
on
books
of
travel
and
adventure
for
him
and
abner
wrote
with
pathetic
facetiousness
that
he
was
that
his
had
not
come
home
as
they
would
have
been
to
put
him
up
for
what
with
the
increase
of
own
progeny
and
the
growth
of
the
strangs
even
the
best
room
with
the
cane
chairs
had
long
since
been
turned
into
a
bedroom
though
it
could
still
be
restored
to
its
pristine
magnificence
on
state
occasions
from
the
neighboring
matt
gravitated
back
to
halifax
his
thoughts
divorced
from
art
centred
on
money
his
artistic
fibre
was
coarser
now
than
in
those
days
of
almost
religious
enthusiasm
for
art
he
had
an
idea
of
opening
a
and
becoming
the
local
but
the
initial
funds
were
to
seek
he
got
a
few
but
the
stupidity
of
his
pupils
was
maddening
and
his
communion
with
their
parents
fretted
him
after
the
larger
mind
of
london
he
feared
he
would
have
to
take
to
the
road
again
in
search
of
sitters
and
the
prospect
of
weary
tramps
in
quest
of
patronizing
and
farmers
was
not
alluring
even
though
that
fine
squeamish
horror
at
the
idea
of
art
to
order
had
been
knocked
out
of
him
he
was
saved
from
the
tramping
by
becoming
assistant
in
a
photographic
caravan
which
toured
the
country
leaving
in
each
village
a
trail
of
attitudinizing
inhabitants
mounted
and
framed
in
the
course
of
which
campaign
by
a
pleasanter
stroke
of
fortune
he
painted
the
portraits
of
a
minister
of
fisheries
and
of
the
cook
he
had
married
and
so
gained
enough
money
to
quit
the
caravan
and
start
a
shop
in
the
village
where
the
happy
couple
had
their
country
home
as
the
poorest
inhabitants
were
for
horses
and
oats
and
hay
were
cheap
and
carriage
taxes
unknown
matt
strang
with
a
commercial
instinct
sharpened
and
an
artistic
interest
blunted
by
miseries
calculated
to
do
well
his
executed
by
his
own
hand
ran
carriages
painted
also
sleighs
house
decorating
portraits
and
the
shop
was
a
success
ere
the
summer
waned
many
of
the
villagers
had
their
idle
sleighs
brilliantly
illumined
and
when
winter
came
their
faded
carriages
were
handed
over
to
matt
to
be
berouged
or
otherwise
beautified
each
man
had
his
equipage
decorated
after
his
own
taste
or
whim
though
he
always
began
by
leaving
it
entirely
to
the
artist
one
would
order
underworks
with
vermilion
stripes
and
an
body
for
another
the
ideal
of
beauty
lay
in
lake
and
while
the
fancy
of
a
third
would
turn
lightly
to
prussian
blue
and
gold
stripes
and
matt
devoid
now
of
artistic
interest
and
thus
of
artistic
irritability
faithfully
obeyed
the
behests
of
his
employers
and
filled
the
leafy
streets
with
a
riotous
motley
of
perambulating
color
the
little
village
was
pranked
and
rejuvenated
it
wore
a
sempiternally
festive
air
the
were
the
house
fronts
fresh
and
bright
the
vehicles
gayly
the
glass
windows
of
the
stores
black
with
lettering
by
day
while
at
night
the
buff
repeated
the
brag
and
over
all
the
village
was
a
sense
of
thus
did
the
artist
throw
a
glamour
over
life
and
touch
the
sleeping
souls
of
his
fellows
to
livelier
issues
though
his
own
interest
in
art
was
numb
but
prices
were
small
and
paid
mainly
in
kind
and
when
once
the
place
was
transmogrified
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
done
the
latter
items
of
his
evoking
no
response
so
matt
shifted
his
ensign
to
starsborough
a
village
on
the
coast
where
he
found
new
scope
for
his
versatile
craftsmanship
as

two
new
items

to
his
painted
prospectus

got
leave
to
set
up
in
the

a
set
of

supplied
the
prows
of
the
ships
with
those
picturesque
wooden
persons
whose
uselessness
is
of
the
essence
of
art
he
occupied
a
corner
in
the
shop
reeking
with
tarry
odors
and
worked
hemmed
in
by
the
who
relieved
the
tedium
of
toil
by
smoking
and
singing
lewd
songs
one
of
his
works
a
turkish
lady
eight
feet
high
to
get
which
done
in
time
cost
him
much
sweat
and
sacrifice
of
other
work
pleased
the
so
vastly
that
he
gave
matt
the
contract
in
preference
to
all
the
other
candidates
who
sent
in
estimates
for
painting
his
next
ship
within
and
without
the
delighted
young
man
saw
his
way
to
speedy
competence
the
thought
of
art
began
to
stir
drowsily
only
it
was
paris
that
now
gleamed
fitfully
in
the
background
of
his
he
talked
over
the
decorations
with
the
and
agreed
to
pay
the
men
from
week
to
week
and
to
supply
the
tools
paints
and
till
the
job
was
completed
when
his
employer
undertook
to
pay
him
the
sum
agreed
upon
in
actual
coin
as
matt
was
able
to
get
the
materials
from
a
store
on
three
credit
and
to
pay
his
men
with
orders
on
the
same
store
on
the
same
terms
and
the
job
would
be
finished
in
less
than
three
months
the
arrangement
promised
to
be
very
profitable
alas
it
proved
the
crash
and
of
all
his
new
prosperity
in
the
middle
of
the
work
the
failed
heavily
and
matt
found
himself
on
the
point
of
bankruptcy
too
for
though
he
sent
in
his
claim
against
the
estate
there
seemed
scant
chance
of
his
obtaining
anything
even
the
turkish
woman
had
not
been
paid
for
matt
having
consented
to
receive
her
price
with
the
rest
of
the
money
for
the
sake
of
getting
silver
in
lieu
of
goods
his
account
with
the
had
run
up
to
he
could
not
see
how
to
meet
his
bills
the
weeks
without
other
work
had
exhausted
his
savings
there
was
even
about
a
fourth
of
his
debt
still
to
be
sent
to
madame
strang
he
got
other
little
jobs
but
the
great
failure
had
reduced
starsborough
to
stagnation
the
time
of
payment
drew
nigh
after
sleepless
nights
of
anguish
he
went
to
the
and
told
him
he
could
not
pay
the
man
received
him
sympathetically
said
he
had
been
expecting
the
confession
and
consented
to
give
him
a
little
time
so
matt
broke
up
his
establishment
and
journeyed
by
train
and
packet
to
another
village
nearer
halifax
and
set
up
his
afresh
a
job
took
him
to
the
capital
and
in
the
streets
he
ran
across
his
starsborough
creditor
who
was
come
up
to
order
hardware
and
who
apparently
delighted
to
see
him
invited
him
to
breakfast
with
him
at
his
hotel
next
morning
always
glad
to
save
a
meal
and
rejoiced
to
find
his
creditor
so
genial
and
debonair
matt
tramped
into
town
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
repaired
to
the
hotel
but
there
was
no
breakfast
for
him
a
officer
awaited
him
instead
and
arrested
him
for
debt
he
had
been
the
victim
of
a
subterfuge
his
creditor
fearing
from
his
migratory
movements
that
he
was
about
to
run
off
to
the
states
and
so
matt
was
clapped
into
the
prison
to
await
his
trial
and
became
one
of
the
band
that
inhabited
its
spacious
ward
promenaded
the
long
whitewashed
corridor
on
which
the
lavatory
gave
and
slept
on
the
iron
beds
ranged
against
the
wall
every
morning
the
bedclothes
were
stripped
off
and
piled
in
the
empty
cells
to
give
the
ward
a
more
habitable
air
in
this
dreary
bed
and
sitting
room
matt
spent
days
of
mental
agony
though
physically
he
fared
better
than
under
his
own
parsimonious
but
the
sense
of
degradation
outweighed
all
else
he
felt
he
could
never
look
his
in
the
face
again
his
character
was
gone
his
ambitions
had
received
their
nay
his
very
business
career
in
his
native
land
was
at
an
end
the
stigma
would
always
soil
his
future
all
the
long
travail
and
aspiration
had
ended
at
what
a
goal
he
could
not
understand
the
careless
merriment
of
his
who
fleeted
the
time
with
cards
which
they
played
for
love
there
was
a
negro
among
them
who
was
the
whetstone
of
their
wit
and
a
frenchman
who
varied
his
tearful
narrative
of
the
misfortune
that
had
brought
him
low
with
ventriloquial
performances
and
anecdotes
of
yankee
millionaires
in
this
gesticulating
little
man
matt
recognized
with
surprise
and
shamefacedness
his
ancient
fractious
subordinate
in
the
halifax
furniture
shop
who
had
taken
him
to
his
bosom
after
due
alcohol
but
he
was
glad
to
find
his
unconscious
fellow
made
no
advances
at
moments
he
forced
himself
to
look
for
the
comic
bohemian
side
of
the
situation
to
imagine
superiority
to
a
prison
the
artist
sublime
amid
the
ruins
of
his
credit
snorting
disdain
for
the
absurd
institutions
of
the
bourgeois
but
neither
this
nor
philosophy
availed
to
shake
his
sense
of
shame
he
summoned
the
infinite
to
his
aid
saw
himself
again
rocking
on
the
little
dory
between
sea
and
sky
and
asked
himself
what
anything
mattered
in
this
vast
of
space
and
time
but
these
excursions
of
the
intellect
left
instinct
unmoved
from
childhood
the
word
had
been
fraught
with
shuddering
associations
they
could
not
be
argued
away
aloofness
from
his
companions
even
when
an
outside
friend
had
sent
in
liquor
or
dainties
to
one
of
them
attracted
the
notice
of
the
jailer
a
kindly
man
in
a
cutaway
coat
with
only
an
official
cap
to
mark
his
calling
he
talked
to
the
sullen
brooding
prisoner
conceived
a
liking
for
him
and
commissioned
him
to
paint
his
portrait
for
ten
dollars
supplying
the
materials
himself
and
providing
a
temporary
easel
the
darkness
that
had
threatened
reason
if
not
his
life
fled
before
this
kindness
the
days
before
the
trial
flew
by
almost
joyously
and
the
nights
were
rendered
more
tolerable
by
being
passed
alone
on
a
plank
bed
in
one
of
the
criminal
cells
whose
stout
doors
studded
with
iron
nails
and
furnished
with
little
gratings
rarely
held
anybody
so
that
the
painter
easily
persuaded
his
patron
to
allow
him
to
occupy
it
he
had
scarcely
set
up
his
easel
when
his
companions
clustered
round
and
the
frenchman
burst
into
tears
of
emotion
and
professed
that
he
too
he
who
spoke
to
you
was
an
artist
if
only
some
one
could
see
the
creditor
who
had
thrown
him
into
prison
and
explain
to
him
that
his
victim
was
guiltless
of
all
save
genius
as
matt
had
heard
all
this
before
he
pursued
his
work
unmoved
affording
a
new
distraction
to
his
mates
so
that
the
life
became
endurable
and
less
love
was
lost
at
cards
but
ere
the
second
sitting
was
over
the
frenchman
who
had
studied
alternately
the
face
and
his
canvas
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joyous
recollection
and
fell
upon
his
neck
crying
that
he
had
at
last
found
again
the
comrade
of
his
soul
when
matt
had
shaken
him
off
he
drew
a
romantic
picture
of
their
early
affection
and
collaboration
for
the
edification
of
the
salon
and
henceforth
took
a
proud
fraternal
interest
in
the
progress
of
the
portrait
the
picture
turned
out
better
than
matt
had
expected
to
his
own
surprise
he
found
himself
painting
more
vigorously
than
ever
his
hand
instead
of
having
lost
its
cunning
seemed
to
have
gained
by
the
rest
the
jailer
was
well
content
and
promised
two
and
a
half
dollars
over
and
above
the
price
but
as
matt
had
expressed
his
intention
of
sending
the
money
to
his
creditor
his
new
friend
held
over
the
surplus
till
he
should
need
it
for
himself
when
at
the
end
of
the
third
week
the
trial
came
on
and
matt
out
solemnly
asserting
absolute
impecuniosity
his
creditor
mollified
by
the
ten
dollars
and
further
assuaged
by
the
sale
of
effects
from
his
tools
to
his
did
not
press
the
of
competency
and
so
the
prisoner
was
set
at
liberty
sundry
other
bankrupts
at
the
same
time
one
or
two
who
had
boasted
privily
of
their
means
perjuring
themselves
back
to
freedom
and
prosperity
before
matt
strang
bade
farewell
to
the
jail
the
frenchman
broke
off
a
ventriloquial
performance
to
beseech
him
with
tears
in
the
name
of
the
of
art
and
for
the
sake
of
their
ancient
affection
now
that
he
was
going
forth
into
the
free
sunshine
to
expostulate
with
that
cruel
creditor
and
plead
for
unhappy
genius
the
persecutor
coble
by
name
would
not
listen
to
his
own
appeals
but
if
a
would
speak
for
him
better
nature
and
every
man
had
a
better
nature
might
be
touched
and
the
skylark
might
soar
freely
again
towards
the
blue
empyrean
he
was
quite
honest
oh
heaven
yes
he
did
not
really
possess
two
hundred
dollars
as
coble
imagined
but
he
could
not
account
for
them
before
the
court
one
would
see
why
though
privately
he
could
account
for
them
in
a
way
that
would
satisfy
every
honest
man
some
emissary
of
satan
had
put
a
bill
into
his
hand
which
said
a
hundred
dollars
we
will
give
you
a
thousand
dollars
of
our
he
had
hankered
as
any
man
might
after
those
thousand
dollars
and
sought
out
the
coiners
for
all
the
world
knew
that
was
their
formula
and
paid
his
hundred
dollars
but
the
bag
of
coin
they
had
given
him
was
snatched
from
him
on
his
road
back
by
one
of
their
agents
determined
not
to
be
outwitted
he
had
gone
again
and
invested
another
hundred
dollars
and
posted
the
parcel
to
himself
at
a
neighboring
but
when
it
arrived
he
had
found
only
a
inside
he
had
been
afraid
to
lest
coble
should
maintain
he
had
the
money
and
thus
get
him
indicted
for
perjury
if
the
friend
of
his
youth
would
lay
these
facts
before
the
cruel
coble
he
would
no
longer
languish
in
a
dungeon
would
not
the
great
artist
promise
him
the
story
seemed
too
strange
to
be
false
and
matt
promised
at
the
risk
of
a
kiss
to
recount
it
to
the
cruel
coble
though
he
failed
to
see
how
it
proved
the
honesty
he
was
indeed
not
sorry
to
have
something
definite
to
do
for
with
the
completion
of
the
portrait
had
come
a
reaction
and
he
had
lapsed
if
not
into
his
first
agony
into
a
listless
apathy
that
was
worse
the
nerveless
purposeless
inertia
of
a
crushed
spirit
he
had
been
in
jail
not
even
a
miracle
could
erase
that
blot
upon
his
name
how
could
he
take
up
the
burden
of
life
afresh
unless
perhaps
temporarily
with
the
sole
object
of
wiping
off
the
debt
which
he
owed
morally
though
no
longer
legally
anyway
he
would
see
this
coble
the
frenchman
seemed
curiously
enough
to
attach
value
to
life
and
if
a
little
bit
of
his
own
life
could
be
of
any
use
to
the
poor
weak
creature
it
was
at
his
disposal
coble
too
must
be
a
strange
person
to
derive
any
satisfaction
from
keeping
the
pygmy
in
prison
in
revenge
for
the
loss
of
a
few
hundred
dollars
money
money
money
how
it
had
cramped
and
crippled
and
defiled
his
life
he
washed
himself
in
the
lavatory
before
leaving
and
brushed
his
clothes
which
were
in
a
very
fair
condition
he
was
startled
to
find
how
many
gray
hairs
streaked
the
curly
locks
he
combed
be
a
monochrome
much
longer
he
thought
surveying
his
mane
with
bitter
merriment
outside
it
was
may
but
he
was
not
brightened
by
the
great
blue
sky
that
roofed
him
once
more
the
bustle
of
life
sounded
pleasantly
about
him
but
he
slunk
through
the
busy
quarters
of
the
town
with
hanging
head
as
if
every
could
read
his
shame
in
his
face
the
horrible
thought
struck
him
suddenly
that
coble
would
know
whence
he
came
but
on
top
of
it
came
the
happy
idea
of
explaining
he
had
only
gone
to
the
jail
to
paint
the
portrait
of
an
official
the
journey
was
not
very
long
though
the
road
was
muddy
and
steep
coble
lived
beyond
citadel
hill
amid
whose
grassy
expanse
a
path
wound
towards
the
more
scattered
portions
of
the
town
the
ice
was
quite
off
the
sunny
fields
except
in
the
shaded
parts
under
the
fences
and
men
were
ploughing
with
yokes
of
oxen
though
here
and
there
piles
of
snow
still
bordered
the
route
which
they
flooded
with
slush
in
their
gradual
deliquescence
suburban
residence
was
a
detached
wooden
cottage
barred
from
the
road
by
a
neat
there
were
attics
in
the
roof
which
like
its
neighbors
was
pitched
with
broad
eaves
for
the
sliding
down
of
the
snow
the
front
garden
had
been
newly
dug
up
and
laid
out
to
receive
seed
there
was
a
dirty
line
round
the
house
showing
where
the
winter
embanking
had
recently
been
removed
matt
pushed
open
the
white
picket
and
walked
up
the
gravel
path
towards
the
pillared
porch
three
wooden
steps
led
to
the
little
platform
and
then
the
door
was
raised
one
step
higher
to
prevent
snow
drifting
in
from
without
matt
knocked
he
heard
the
inner
door
open
the
patter
of
light
footsteps
then
the
outer
door
swung
back
and
a
girl
passably
pretty
appeared
in
the
little
entry
between
the
doors
which
were
thus
duplicated
against
the
frost
matt
lifted
his
hat
and
inquired
for
coble
he
had
reverted
to
the
drawling
accents
of
the
colony
though
not
altogether
to
its
locutions
down
at
the
store
answered
the
girl
staring
at
the
visitor
will
he
be
in
matt
asked
disappointed
not
for
hours
said
miss
coble
it
anything
i
can
tell
him
no
i
think
so
matt
replied
hesitatingly
had
better
call
again
this
the
girl
lingered
silently
without
closing
the
door
there
was
a
perceptible
pause
she
answered
at
last
guess
you
he
raised
his
hat
again
and
went
down
the
gravel
path
at
the
it
struck
him
that
he
ought
to
have
inquired
the
address
of
the
store
in
town
and
so
saved
a
second
journey
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
the
girl
still
at
the
door
looking
after
him
then
it
seemed
funny
to
go
back
he
shut
the
gate
hastily
and
pursued
his
way
to
town
down
the
muddy
road
wondering
what
he
would
do
next
and
how
he
could
cope
with
life
the
thought
of
the
frenchman
brought
up
the
memory
of
that
furniture
warehouse
in
which
they
had
worked
together
in
the
days
of
his
boyish
dreams
he
bent
his
steps
towards
it
with
a
vague
thought
of
seeking
work
there
again
but
found
it
had
been
converted
into
an
emporium
for
as
he
sauntered
aimlessly
down
the
street
his
eye
was
caught
by
a
lurid
picture
in
a
store
window
it
represented
a
shark
snapping
savagely
at
a
diver
upon
the
bed
of
the
ocean
he
smiled
at
the
crude
composition
which
reminded
him
of
his
own
early
works
then
as
he
perceived
its
relation
to
the
his
smile
became
broader
sponge
was
the
staple
and
a
gigantic
delicate
sponge
with
ornamental
and
fragments
of
rock
adhering
realistically
to
it
was
a
conspicuous
object
amid
and
and
and
glass
cases
covering
there
were
little
sponges
on
a
card
and
matt
started
violently
as
he
read
the
mountain
had
come
to
mahomet
he
walked
in
crunching
over
a
débris
of
shells
grit
and
sand
and
inhaling
a
pungent
saline
odor
a
veritable
mountain
of
a
man
towered
over
him
with
beetling
brows
and
snowy
hair
and
beard
his
paunch
protruded
imposingly
and
his
eyes
glittered
coble
said
matt
inquiringly
me
cried
the
mountain
of
flesh
in
fierce
accents
as
if
defying
contradiction
matt
felt
the
business
would
not
be
easy
taken
the
liberty
of
coming
to
you
on
behalf
of
that
tarnation
frenchman
shrieked
coble
matt
reddened
uncomfortably
the
fifth
man
sent
me
when
did
you
come
out
of
prison
been
painting
the
portrait
matt
stammered
with
burning
cheeks
i
used
to
know
the
poor
little
man
years
ago
and
he
says
listen
now
does
he
think
no
business
to
attend
to
send
me
here
he
sent
me
to
your
a
new
dodge
but
i
reckon
he
told
you
the
old
things
eh
that
a
cuss
that
sneak
the
coppers
off
a
eyes
or
squeeze
a
cent
till
the
eagle
really
he
tell
me
that
said
matt
you
spare
the
old
feelings
i
know
what
a
man
says
when
he
finds
you
be
swindled
the
everlastingest
old
dodger
that
ever
drummed
for
me
his
tricks
puzzle
a
philadelphia
lawyer
the
only
honest
bit
of
work
he
ever
did
in
his
life
was
that
thar
of
a
shark
i
admit
and
willingly
let
the
poor
devil
out
of
the
cage
if
my
darter
so
bitter
agen
him
there
the
truth
i
never
told
it
to
any
of
the
other
fellows
they
all
looked
such
moulty
say
now
you
said
you
were
a
painter
that
a
good
although
words
were
now
more
amiable
his
accent
was
still
fierce
and
it
required
some
courage
on
part
to
reply
that
the
picture
was
pretty
good
in
a
manner
that
betokened
that
it
was
pretty
bad
two
of
a
trade
quoth
the
mountain
of
a
man
shark
be
like
that
matt
explained
mildly
has
to
turn
on
his
back
before
biting
it
true
to
said
coble
in
irate
tones
the
got
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
sponge
business
and
the
divers
in
no
sort
danger
whatever
from
it
i
see
where
truth
to
life
comes
in
but
the
less
lies
you
tell
in
art
the
better
urged
matt
do
you
another
if
you
your
dodge
is
it
not
asking
anything
for
it
the
young
man
retorted
indignantly
be
a
return
for
your
listening
to
my
coble
was
startled
he
cried
sharply
a
christian
step
outside
and
liquor
the
invitation
was
uttered
so
fiercely
that
it
sounded
like
a
command
especially
as
the
titan
stamped
three
times
with
his
foot
only
his
way
of
signalling
to
his
subordinate
matt
found
in
the
nearest
bar
which
happened
to
be
an
illicit
one
approached
through
a
porch
at
the
back
of
a
temperance
hotel
for
the
convenience
of
avowed
teetotalers
the
imparted
to
matt
the
information
that
it
was
the
amorous
advances
that
had
imbittered
his
daughter
my
part
he
said
far
from
to
keep
him
in
there
in
clover
like
to
lift
him
out
on
the
point
of
my
toe
and
make
him
vamoose
from
the
town
that
smart
you
see
his
heels
for
the
dust
mention
it
to
rosina
that
been
putting
in
a
good
word
for
the
skunk
but
i
think
listen
a
but
sure
she
will
said
matt
looks
a
kindhearted
young
seen
her
exclaimed
coble
fiercely
i
saw
her
this
afternoon
said
matt
seen
the
purtiest
gal
see
this
year
set
up
again
this
old
whopping
good
always
rely
on
a
temperance
hotel
for
good
whiskey
and
as
my
gal
has
a
goodish
bit
of
money
pursued
the
old
man
smacking
his
lips
and
growing
communicative
without
losing
any
of
the
sternness
of
his
accent
can
understand
what
made
the
wretched
little
froggy
roll
his
eyes
and
twist
his
mustache
at
her
how
he
found
it
out
will
be
a
mystery
to
my
day
for
careful
never
to
breathe
a
whisper
of
it
to
a
single
soul
but
he
ferreted
out
somehow
or
that
when
my
rosie
will
step
into
an
income
of
eight
hundred
he
shouted
the
statement
so
loudly
that
the
whole
bar
pricked
up
its
ears
matt
quite
believed
that
coble
was
incapable
of
whispering
anything
to
anybody
he
had
a
vague
envy
of
the
fortunate
girl
to
mention
three
thousand
dollars
put
aside
myself
to
hand
her
on
her
continued
coble
folks
are
lucky
nowadays
when
i
married
i
had
to
lend
my
ten
dollars
to
rig
himself
up
respectable
for
before
they
parted
the
mountain
of
flesh
had
consented
thunderously
to
supplying
another
picture
of
the
dangers
of
but
would
not
bind
himself
although
in
his
third
glass
to
do
more
in
return
than
lay
the
matter
before
his
daughter
once
alone
in
the
streets
again
matt
felt
he
had
made
a
bad
bargain
the
two
and
a
half
dollars
the
jailer
had
given
him
were
all
his
funds
and
even
the
few
nickels
that
would
have
to
be
expended
on
common
and
the
were
a
consideration
but
he
loyally
executed
the
work
in
the
bedroom
he
had
ventured
to
take
finding
rather
a
relief
in
this
further
postponement
of
the
problem
of
his
future
by
the
following
afternoon
he
was
back
at
with
a
brilliant
sketch
far
more
arrestive
than
the
the
shark
was
more
formidable
the
nude
diver
more
graceful
his
netted
bag
more
accurate
and
the
was
a
veritable
of
and
polyps
coble
glared
long
at
the
sketch
as
matt
held
it
up
but
he
said
nothing
do
you
think
of
it
asked
matt
apprehensively
at
last
do
i
think
of
it
roared
old
coble
and
rushing
to
the
window
he
grabbed
the
old
inaccurate
shark
tore
it
savagely
in
two
snatched
the
new
picture
from
the
hands
of
the
astonished
matt
filled
up
the
vacancy
with
it
dashed
outside
to
survey
it
from
the
sidewalk
and
reappearing
at
the
door
bellowed
this
way
young
man
and
stamped
three
times
on
the
threshold
over
the
old
rye
he
reported
to
the
artist
that
he
had
found
his
rosie
more
placable
than
usual
that
she
was
even
willing
to
listen
to
the
young
plea
though
she
seemed
to
want
to
hear
it
from
his
own
mouth
before
deciding
matt
gladly
consented
to
sup
that
evening
with
the
mountain
and
his
daughter
free
drinks
never
surprised
him
but
a
free
square
meal
was
like
having
larks
flying
into
mouth
ready
roasted
it
was
the
happiest
evening
he
had
spent
for
many
a
long
day
there
was
a
spotless
cloth
on
the
round
table
and
the
food
was
good
if
solid
miss
coble
made
herself
agreeable
and
if
she
was
not
so
pretty
as
her
father
saw
her
her
plump
cheek
was
sufficiently
rosy
and
her
figure
sufficiently
comely
and
her
frock
sufficiently
nice
to
be
grateful
to
the
eye
of
an
artist
and
a
young
man
just
emerged
from
prison
society
and
starving
for
the
amenities
of
life
her
eyes
lit
up
pleasantly
when
he
addressed
her
or
when
she
helped
him
to
more
some
stuffed
birds
over
a
low
bookcase
that
contained
a
few
brightly
bound
volumes
reminded
him
pleasurably
of
past
miseries
the
stentorian
voice
of
old
coble
almost
monopolized
the
conversation
he
had
much
to
say
that
was
not
worth
listening
to
on
the
bad
crops
of
the
year
before
last
the
scarcity
of
helps
and
the
failure
of
the
colony
to
go
ahead
which
was
apparently
connected
with
the
uncleanliness
of
the
inhabitants
as
manifest
from
the
small
sales
of
after
dinner
the
mountain
smoked
and
after
smoking
the
volcano
slept
afraid
you
think
got
a
bad
temper
said
miss
coble
abruptly
she
had
hastily
cleared
away
the
supper
dishes
and
had
seated
herself
half
recumbent
amid
a
litter
of
sewing
upon
a
couch
opposite
the
which
matt
now
occupied
the
young
man
instinctively
glanced
towards
her
trumpeting
parent
sound
enough
you
hear
she
said
laughing
gayly
only
hope
he
disturb
you
used
to
only
hope
i
disturb
answered
matt
guess
making
more
noise
than
us
laughed
miss
coble
even
be
quiet
when
asleep
i
was
going
to
explain
to
you
that
he
help
it
something
wrong
with
his
throat
it
happened
when
his
voice
broke
in
his
boyhood
and
it
always
sounds
as
if
he
was
angry
it
always
frightens
off
strangers
but
he
is
really
the
papa
in
the
matt
smiled
did
think
he
was
rather
a
at
first
he
admitted
found
him
real
jolly
and
quite
make
it
out
all
this
he
continued
to
smile
at
the
drollness
of
disability
and
the
eyes
met
his
in
an
answering
gleam
of
merriment
says
a
powerful
painter
strang
she
said
after
a
silence
filled
up
by
ruttling
sounds
from
larynx
your
only
seen
a
rough
thing
i
did
for
him
he
protested
diffidently
she
shook
her
head
sagely
going
down
town
to
see
it
and
she
flashed
a
sunny
smile
at
him
that
showed
her
teeth
were
white
matt
murmured
uneasily
not
worth
the
do
me
good
anyway
getting
fat
pa
says
it
be
awful
if
i
was
to
take
after
him
you
know
he
lives
away
from
town
so
as
to
have
exercise
up
and
down
citadel
hill
but
he
might
as
well
have
lived
over
the
and
she
giggled
not
unmusically
tell
what
he
would
have
been
matt
reminded
her
with
a
smile
you
frighten
me
he
might
have
come
through
the
walls
do
you
think
there
is
really
any
danger
of
my
growing
like
him
do
tell
no
danger
of
your
losing
your
good
looks
replied
matt
gallantly
mean
i
never
had
any
she
said
with
a
roguish
gleam
that
made
the
plump
face
piquant
you
know
what
i
mean
he
protested
lamely
miss
coble
meditatively
picked
up
a
piece
of
tape
from
the
litter
of
sewing
and
put
it
round
her
waist
then
she
measured
her
bust
that
the
proper
proportion
she
said
holding
it
up
are
supposed
to
know
they
figure
be
better
said
matt
the
girl
shook
her
head
in
laughing
reproof
guess
better
measure
you
and
prove
it
then
said
matt
rising
how
that
lamp
flares
cried
miss
coble
rushing
towards
the
table
and
carefully
fumbling
with
the
regulator
matt
resumed
his
seat
feeling
rather
foolish
but
soon
when
the
girl
turned
the
talk
on
himself
the
reserved
solitary
young
man
found
himself
telling
her
of
adventures
by
sea
and
land
which
he
had
not
told
anybody
perhaps
because
nobody
had
ever
asked
him
he
gave
halifax
prison
a
wide
berth
warding
off
her
casual
questions
about
his
position
and
prospects
by
general
statements
about
his
artistic
aspirations
concerning
aspects
of
london
life
miss
curiosity
was
at
its
keenest
her
own
experience
of
existence
having
been
limited
she
said
to
halifax
and
its
environs
with
faint
childish
reminiscences
of
greencastle
pennsylvania
where
her
mother
had
died
thirteen
years
before
when
she
was
six
years
old
but
i
mean
to
tell
you
my
age
she
said
pouting
ten
time
you
will
know
i
am
nearly
matt
was
about
to
reassure
her
by
declaring
that
in
ten
time
he
would
have
forgotten
all
about
her
when
the
fall
of
the
pipe
checked
the
unchivalrous
statement
he
rose
to
go
as
soon
as
the
mountain
awoke
for
he
had
a
goodish
tramp
before
him
miss
coble
accompanied
him
to
the
outer
door
his
eye
was
caught
by
the
beauty
of
the
moon
gleaming
irregularly
from
a
lurid
rack
of
clouds
he
stood
in
charmed
silence
gazing
upward
are
you
staring
at
you
going
to
say
asked
miss
coble
rather
tartly
his
spirit
returned
to
earth
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
she
put
her
fingers
rougher
but
warmer
into
his
for
the
first
time
she
said
softly
he
did
not
let
her
hand
go
immediately
at
the
last
instant
he
was
invaded
by
an
indefinite
conviction
that
something
he
knew
not
what
had
still
to
be
done
or
said
he
stood
silent
on
the
little
platform
as
if
echoing
his
thought
you
forgot
something
she
asked
his
heart
leaped
violently
with
a
thrilling
suggestion
he
looked
into
her
quizzing
eyes
they
were
on
a
level
with
his
own
her
shorter
figure
having
the
advantage
of
the
raised
threshold
thought
you
came
to
speak
to
me
about
a
frenchman
she
went
on
he
was
relieved
and
disappointed
course
what
a
fool
i
am
i
said
a
word
about
too
late
now
i
stand
talking
here
the
neighbors
might
see
so
sorry
said
matt
in
a
tone
have
to
come
again
evening
then
if
you
want
to
go
on
with
it
certain
then
said
matt
raising
his
hat
he
walked
briskly
down
the
glowing
with
the
pleasure
of
the
evening
and
looking
forward
to
another
pleasant
free
meal
on
the
morrow
then
his
eye
sought
the
moon
again
but
the
had
covered
it
up
entirely
chapter
xi
a
hostage
to
fortune
lying
awake
next
morning
after
a
night
of
troubled
dreams
it
flashed
upon
him
that
he
ought
scarcely
to
go
and
see
miss
coble
again
upon
the
mere
impulsive
invitation
given
on
the
without
her
knowledge
he
was
angry
with
illustration
she
said
himself
for
having
so
curiously
let
himself
drift
away
from
the
very
purpose
of
his
visit
he
concluded
he
had
best
call
on
old
coble
again
at
the
store
and
walked
thither
with
hangdog
mien
unable
even
now
to
shake
off
the
jail
old
coble
was
sorting
out
a
bale
of
sponge
into
three
baskets
one
for
bests
one
for
seconds
and
one
for
thirds
young
man
he
roared
matt
felt
a
momentary
trepidation
before
he
remembered
that
the
old
man
meant
his
tones
to
be
inviting
he
crunched
his
way
towards
the
mountain
over
the
gritty
débris
sniffing
in
the
pungent
aroma
of
the
place
the
old
giant
straightened
himself
brushed
the
sand
off
each
hand
with
the
other
and
running
his
fingers
through
his
white
beard
by
way
of
combing
that
held
out
his
hairy
paw
to
matt
he
gripped
the
young
long
fingers
heartily
then
waved
him
to
a
seat
on
an
empty
inverted
hope
not
interrupting
you
said
matt
at
all
said
coble
in
angry
accents
there
was
a
pause
made
a
fool
of
myself
last
night
matt
commenced
abruptly
coble
looked
down
inquiringly
at
him
say
one
word
to
your
daughter
about
the
frenchman
he
continued
ruefully
the
mountain
shook
with
explosive
laughter
i
suppose
you
were
too
taken
up
about
matt
reddened
uncomfortably
but
was
silent
gal
seems
to
know
a
powerful
deal
about
you
anyway
said
old
coble
with
a
homeric
chuckle
had
to
talk
about
something
matt
explained
apologetically
rosie
to
want
to
talk
about
anything
else
a
fact
i
reckon
she
was
glad
enough
not
to
be
reminded
of
the
but
got
to
tell
her
the
young
man
urged
uneasily
yes
she
knows
got
to
tell
her
coming
you
thought
of
it
matt
stammered
taken
aback
i
might
you
be
afraid
of
us
we
bite
we
he
spat
out
gritty
atmosphere
makes
one
powerful
matt
had
an
instant
of
intense
mental
conflict
impecuniosity
contending
with
his
instinct
of
what
was
due
to
the
situation
and
past
hospitalities
you
liquor
with
me
he
said
was
just
about
to
ask
you
that
and
the
mountain
stamped
his
foot
three
times
the
moment
the
two
glasses
were
set
on
the
counter
of
the
little
secret
bar
matt
threw
down
a
ringing
dollar
with
careless
magnificence
coble
put
his
paw
on
it
and
pushed
it
back
to
him
throwing
down
a
rival
dollar
there
was
a
playful
scuffle
of
shoving
fingers
accompanied
by
expostulatory
murmurs
then
matt
rejoicing
in
defeat
resignedly
pocketed
his
vanquished
piece
do
you
make
out
of
that
there
business
suddenly
asked
coble
as
he
set
down
his
glass
and
lounged
reposefully
against
the
counter
matt
took
another
sip
of
whiskey
there
are
ups
and
downs
he
said
the
uppiest
up
depends
said
matt
vaguely
i
could
succeed
in
london
no
end
to
the
money
i
might
make
it
unusual
to
get
three
or
four
thousand
dollars
for
a
or
four
thousand
dollars
roared
the
titan
do
you
think
i
was
raised
my
uncle
in
london
has
often
paid
five
thousand
dollars
for
a
picture
yes
and
even
ten
though
usually
after
the
why
you
go
to
london
afford
it
said
matt
frankly
been
there
but
a
great
job
to
get
on
without
money
so
i
had
to
come
your
uncle
buy
your
pictures
good
enough
yet

to
take

with

you
saw
me
out
just
now

but
the
ones
in
the

to
be

soon
as
they
are
bleached
with
permanganate

things
that
the

wants
when
a

nobody

i
can

i
kinder
fancy
he
added
with
a
roguish
twinkle
must
have
found
that
out
of
late
now
what
you
want
strang
is
to
marry
a
purty
healthy
gal
with
two
or
three
thousand
dollars
to
tide
over
the
time
till
you
can
make
your
five
thousand
a
matt
shot
a
startled
glance
at
beaming
face
what
he
read
there
supplemented
the
sensational
suggestion
of
the
words
a
nervous
thrill
ran
through
all
his
body
the
thought
was
like
a
at
once
swift
dazzling
and
terrifying
but
without
waiting
to
analyze
his
state
of
mind
he
felt
immediately
that
there
was
one
thing
which
at
the
outset
rendered
the
idea
impossible
honesty
required
that
he
should
instantly
put
a
stop
to
the
overtures
by
informing
him
that
he
was
a
dishonored
man
that
he
had
been
in
prison
but
still
he
shrank
from
the
union
was
so
impossible
that
it
seemed
superfluous
to
humiliate
himself
he
replied
five
only
the
uppiest
up
as
you
call
it
if
i
get
there
i
might
be
thought
a
any
smart
man
who
saw
that
shark
would
take
the
risk
of
that
and
even
if
you
get
to
the
uppiest
up
there
be
no
fear
of
your
coming
down
again
to
the
downiest
matt
turned
his
eyes
away
and
his
fingers
tattooed
nervously
on
the
stem
of
his
glass
frenchy
friend
of
yours
now
he
had
the
sense
and
the
sarse
to
want
my
gal
but
of
course
no
proper
parent
would
trust
his
darter
to
a
man
like
that
so
there
he
lays
in
the
downiest
down
good
name
for
jail
eh
ho
ho
matt
wished
his
companion
could
moderate
his
accents
he
did
not
relish
this
thunderous
talk
of
jail
i
must
be
going
now
he
said
with
you
with
you
genially
thundered
coble
sauntering
after
him
into
the
sunny
street
just
think
that
pointer
mine
over
it
lets
you
keep
your
independence
and
your
high
notions
and
you
indebted
to
anybody
all
got
to
do
is
to
find
a
purty
gal
got
money
and
who
fool
it
away
a
gal
been
raised
simply
and
can
do
her
own
and
make
her
own
dresses
and
play
the
pianner
you
find
a
gal
like
that
with
a
sensible
father
that
think
wuss
of
a
young
man
because
been
in
the
downiest
know
matt
faltered
he
came
to
a
halt
course
i
know
it
in
the
paper
i
did
paint
the
portrait
of
the
jailer
he
protested
his
cheeks
fiery
knew
been
in
chokey
all
the
coble
clapped
his
paw
on
the
last
button
of
his
waistcoat
stomach
that
size
born
yesterday
but
kept
it
from
rosie
she
understand
business
nor
how
a
fair
wind
and
a
tornado
around
and
everything
low
you
find
a
good
father
pursued
coble
in
accents
as
impersonal
as
they
were
angry
so
that
matt
fancied
he
had
mistaken
the
import
convince
him
your
folks
are
respectable
and
no
wife
around
in
london
or
new
york
city
and
here
he
resumed
his
walk
he
jump
at
you
waal
blamed
if
i
give
you
my
own
darter
there
what
he
would
have
replied
to
this
wager
matt
never
knew
for
with
a
sudden
cry
of
the
stolen
the
mountain
bounded
forward
with
incredible
alacrity
and
dashed
into
the
store
but
it
was
his
own
child
who
was
the
temporary
thief
matt
following
coble
back
into
the
store
to
see
if
his
picture
had
been
really
paid
the
compliment
of
appropriation
found
father
and
daughter
bending
admiringly
over
it
as
it
stood
on
the
counter
propped
up
against
some
large
coarse
his
heart
beat
faster
with
surprise
and
excitement
you
here
said
rosina
raising
a
face
that
seemed
radiant
amid
the
dull
browns
and
grays
of
the
store
know
you
would
be
here
he
answered
awkwardly
not
knowing
what
to
reply
i
tell
you
yesterday
i
was
coming
she
looked
roguishly
at
him
from
beneath
the
broad
brim
of
her
hat
whose
narrow
strings
were
tied
coquettishly
under
her
left
ear
you
did
i
forgot
he
said
seem
to
forget
everything
she
responded
pertly
lost
his
head
altogether
roared
old
coble
you
for
reminding
me
said
matt
eagerly
you
are
here
i
can
tell
you
what
the
frenchman
the
frenchman
said
miss
coble
pouting
but
languishing
in
prison
this
fine
bright
day
strang
painted
the
portrait
how
he
met
the
rogue
old
coble
interrupted
he
often
cries
went
on
matt
miss
coble
laughed
you
make
me
feel
like
a
princess
keeping
men
in
how
you
ought
to
feel
said
matt
i
guess
take
the
privilege
of
a
princess
said
miss
coble
let
him
out
on
my
coble
roared
with
laughter
a
fair
offer
for
you
my
matt
felt
very
embarrassed
but
he
ventured
to
hope
the
poor
sake
that
miss
coble
would
get
married
soon
hope
not
said
coble
to
relief
poor
devil
what
am
i
to
do
without
my
rosie
get
along
all
right
said
miss
coble
with
a
playful
tug
at
his
drooping
white
beard
can
send
for
aunt
wish
be
serious
about
the
poor
man
in
the
prison
matt
pleaded
am
serious
miss
coble
insisted
indignantly
yes
serious
interposed
the
parent
solid
is
rosie
you
squeeze
her
like
this
sponge
to
me
the
only
way
to
help
your
man
is
to
hurry
on
the
the
advent
of
a
customer
here
removed
him
chuckling
from
the
conversation
and
while
he
was
talking
angrily
to
the
matt
who
had
been
itching
to
slip
away
found
himself
compelled
to
linger
on
and
entertain
the
young
lady
a
task
which
he
ended
by
finding
pleasant
enough
when
she
at
last
said
she
must
go
about
her
marketing
he
even
asked
if
there
was
anything
he
could
carry
for
her
no
we
get
the
things
sent
but
you
can
walk
along
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
so
matt
threaded
his
way
with
her
among
the
busy
stores
feeling
her
a
part
of
the
sunny
freshness
of
the
day
to
which
he
was
now
alive
again
and
walking
with
head
erect
for
he
felt
himself
rehabilitated
by
the
companionship
of
so
genteel
a
member
of
society
he
was
amused
by
the
keen
bargains
she
drove
and
acquired
a
new
interest
in
prices
evidently
coble
was
right
she
would
make
a
provident
but
she
would
only
let
him
see
her
part
of
the
way
home
though
she
told
him
papa
expected
him
to
join
their
evening
meal
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
you
she
said
know
why
know
why
either
said
matt
simply
why
miss
coble
answered
enigmatically
then
she
lent
him
her
gloved
fingers
for
a
moment
and
gave
him
a
pleasant
smile
and
tripped
away
and
he
went
back
and
down
to
the
and
lounged
about
aimlessly
in
the
sun
sky
and
sea
and
shipping
and
the
glimpses
of
hill
and
forest
across
the
harbor
and
the
white
and
the
bronzed
scandinavian
sailors
thrilling
him
with
the
old
sense
of
the
beauty
and
romance
of
life
but
the
open
air
gave
him
an
appetite
too
and
the
appetite
brought
him
back
to
the
sordidness
of
things
to
his
pockets
and
the
insistent
sphinx
of
his
future
he
laid
out
a
few
cents
to
stave
off
hunger
till
evening
should
bring
better
fare
at
then
in
the
stronger
mood
induced
by
even
this
minimum
of
nutriment
a
tiresome
inner
voice
began
asking
by
what
right
he
meditated
foisting
himself
upon
strangers
he
had
no
longer
the
excuse
of
the
frenchman
he
had
heard
miss
ultimatum
on
that
matter
and
the
tiresome
voice
persisted
in
dragging
up
other
troublesome
thoughts
from
the
depths
of
consciousness
as
he
walked
about
the
lively
quays
it
kept
repeating
observations
though
less
loudly
despite
some
dubious
remarks
despite
the
improbability
and
unexpectedness
of
the
whole
thing
was
it
possible
for
matt
to
doubt
that
the
old
man
would
be
willing
to
give
him
his
daughter
with
whatever
timidity
he
shrank
from
facing
the
possibility
wilfully
closing
his
eyes
as
before
a
great
glare
he
could
not
but
feel
that
idea
was
both
rash
and
generous
of
course
his
future
would
justify
the
old
trust
and
repay
it
a
but
such
confidence
was
none
the
less
touching
coble
did
not
know
the
sun
and
sea
had
made
the
young
man
drunk
again
that
he
was
entertaining
a
genius
and
miss
coble
too
how
kind
of
her
to
be
so
nice
to
a
penniless
young
man
her
pleasant
smiles
had
been
medicinal
sunshine
to
his
despairing
apathy
if
he
had
not
met
the
cobles
what
would
have
become
of
him
but
was
the
girl
quite
of
her
mind
towards
him
her
attitude
was
certainly
not
repellent
he
allowed
himself
to
dally
undisguisedly
with
the
idea
and
it
made
him
giddy
the
hope
of
art
flamed
again
so
fiercely
that
he
wondered
how
it
could
have
lain
smouldering
so
long
in
his
bosom
he
was
like
a
pedestrian
toiling
and
towards
a
great
light
that
shone
celestially
on
the
verge
of
the
horizon
for
years
he
had
followed
the
sacred
gleam
over
lonely
deserts
and
waste
places
with
hunger
and
thirst
and
pain
and
now
as
with
bleeding
feet
that
could
drag
along
no
longer
he
was
fain
to
drop
down
on
the
lo
a
sound
of
wheels
and
a
sudden
carriage
at
his
side
and
he
had
but
to
step
in
to
be
driven
luxuriously
to
the
goal
and
in
this
fairy
carriage
moreover
sat
a
pretty
maiden
on
whose
ripe
breast
he
could
pillow
his
tired
head
and
in
whose
arms
he
could
find
consolation
for
the
blank
years
oh
it
was
bewildering
dazzling
intoxicating
but
did
he
love
the
maiden
of
this
enchanting
vision
well
what
was
love
it
would
certainly
be
sweet
to
hold
her
warm
hand
in
his
to
see
her
blue
eyes
soften
with
tenderness
as
they
gazed
into
his
own
it
was
so
long
since
a
woman
had
kissed
him
such
weary
crawling
barren
years
that
ancient
episode
with
priscilla
came
up
as
it
had
not
seldom
done
before
transfigured
by
the
haze
of
time
and
the
of
romance
he
had
long
since
forgotten
how
little
the
girl
had
really
appealed
to
him
in
the
flesh
and
to
remember
that
he
had
spurned
her
caresses
did
not
always
give
him
a
glow
of
moral
satisfaction
in
the
delicious
sunshine
that
danced
in
a
myriad
gleams
on
the
green
waters
and
made
the
air
like
wine
lurked
a
subtle
appeal
to
his
mere
manhood
were
not
all
women
equally
lovable
for
their
sex
in
the
novels
and
poems
he
had
read
love
was
glorified
and
woman
was
a
spirit
in
his
own
soul
lay
divine
conceptions
of
womanhood
that
inspired
his
art
and
sanctified
his
dreams
a
womanhood
whose
bodily
incarnation
imagined
now
in
this
gracious
shape
now
in
that
was
the
outer
symbol
of
an
inner
loveliness
of
thought
and
emotion
but
he
had
not
met
this
ideal
womanhood
nor
did
he
even
expect
to
meet
it
in
the
crude
common
day
once
or
twice
in
his
london
life
as
in
his
boyhood
in
this
very
city
of
halifax
when
he
had
worshipped
the
beautiful
horsewoman
he
had
seemed
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
it
but
it
was
always
far
off
as
far
as
the
star
from
the
moth
and
so
whether
seen
or
divined
it
belonged
almost
equally
to
that
world
of
imagination
in
which
his
true
life
had
been
lived
in
which
he
had
always
taken
refuge
from
the
real
he
had
scarcely
known
before
a
girl
so
refined
as
miss
coble
unless
perhaps
it
was
the
adolescent
ruth
hailey
whose
shy
stateliness
had
made
her
so
alien
from
the
little
girl
he
dimly
remembered
taking
for
a
sweetheart
in
those
days
of
childish
mimicry
when
one
drives
broomsticks
for
horses
why
should
he
not
marry
this
pleasant
plump
young
woman
if
she
would
condescend
to
him
though
her
position
was
so
much
better
than
his
he
did
not
feel
her
too
remote
from
him
for
comfortable
companionship
especially
as
she
would
never
know
that
he
had
been
in
jail
if
he
did
not
love
her
in
the
vague
transcendental
sense
at
least
he
did
not
love
any
other
woman
and
was
never
likely
to
he
was
not
as
other
men
his
life
was
not
in
their
world
it
was
centred
on
art
it
was
occupied
with
visions
its
goal
was
not
happiness
or
a
home
but
if
these
offered
themselves
to
him
by
the
way
even
while
they
made
his
real
goal
possible
it
were
mere
insane
to
refuse
them
a
wife
would
save
him
from
his
lower
self
and
in
his
moments
of
artistic
despair
she
would
always
be
there
to
comfort
and
console
nay
and
he
smiled
at
the
consideration
even
in
his
moments
of
artistic
achievement
she
could
be
there
as
a
model
models
ran
away
with
a
great
deal
of
money
and
for
an
artist
a
wife
was
really
an
economy
and
if
in
his
artistic
aspiration
she
could
have
no
share
neither
could
any
one
else
woman
or
man
an
artist
could
not
really
have
a
mate
at
most
a
mistress
or
a
his
art
was
a
holy
of
holies
in
which
he
must
ever
be
the
sole
priest
and
in
this
holy
of
holies
ideal
womanhood
could
still
have
its
place
as
before
such
are
the
pitfalls
of
the
artistic
temperament
moving
amid
unrealities
spinning
its
own
cosmos
three
thousand
dollars
down
he
could
pay
off
the
and
cleanse
away
the
prison
stain
he
could
send
madame
strang
her
little
balance
and
best
of
all
and
the
thought
moved
him
almost
to
tears
his
poor
brothers
and
sisters
would
henceforth
be
certain
of
their
allowance
for
himself
the
prospects
were
equally
tempting
a
in
europe
in
the
cities
of
romantic
dream
amid
the
masterpieces
of
art
and
then
when
after
a
couple
of
years
of
study
and
work
his
own
masterpiece
should
be
completed
a
settled
income
of
eight
hundred
dollars
bread
and
cheese
always
sure
putting
him
for
life
beyond
the
vulgar
necessity
of
pandering
to
the
market
rescuing
him
from
that
sordid
internal
conflict
which
imbittered
even
when
it
failed
to
degrade
oh
the
rapture
of
a
life
so
consecrated
to
art
but
would
miss
coble
or
her
parent
consent
to
this
expenditure
of
the
money
of
course
it
would
all
have
to
be
distinctly
understood
ere
he
could
agree
to
marry
the
girl
he
flushed
finding
how
mercenary
motive
predominated
in
his
reverie
coble
had
indeed
hinted
acquiescence
in
some
such
scheme
but
an
instinct
kept
the
young
man
from
concluding
to
acquiesce
in
it
himself
a
vague
shame
and
repugnance
struggled
with
his
sense
of
the
advantages
of
the
match
waxing
so
strong
in
the
reaction
that
followed
the
glow
of
temptation
that
he
determined
not
to
go
to
the
that
evening
this
visit
he
felt
would
be
fatal
he
went
home
to
his
little
room
in
the
central
slums
determined
not
to
stir
out
he
had
meant
to
go
to
bed
broad
day
though
it
was
and
sleep
away
the
temptation
but
he
only
threw
himself
upon
the
pallet
in
his
clothes
and
was
more
conscious
of
hunger
than
of
the
heaviness
necessary
for
sleep
yet
he
would
not
break
into
his
last
two
dollars
he
tried
to
divert
his
mind
from
miss
dowry
by
alternative
projects
for
continuing
his
life
but
they
only
served
to
show
the
length
of
the
bleak
arid
solitary
road
that
lay
before
his
bruised
feet
if
he
let
the
carriage
go
by
money
money
money
what
had
he
not
suffered
from
the
struggle
for
it
degrading
to
live
on
another
money
it
was
life
without
money
that
was
degrading
humiliating
full
of
petty
considerations
consumed
in
irrelevant
labors
in
the
novels
that
made
such
a
fuss
about
love
troubles
the
sorrows
seemed
to
him
infinitely
smaller
than
the
carks
and
worries
of
prosaic
existence
he
dozed
a
little
and
dreamed
of
his
mother
he
was
back
in
childhood
standing
with
bare
feet
in
an
icy
passage
and
she
was
screaming
at
harriet
for
refusing
to
marry
coble
he
went
through
all
the
old
agony
of
these
frequent
domestic
tragedies
but
he
did
not
feel
cold
so
much
as
hungry
and
breakfast
was
being
delayed
by
the
squabble
he
heard
daisy
equally
aggrieved
lowing
in
the
barn
in
the
face
of
the
advantages
of
the
coble
marriage
it
did
seem
unreasonable
of
harriet
to
stick
to
bully
preep
who
would
probably
beat
her
he
awoke
with
a
sensation
of
relief
which
was
instantly
exchanged
for
a
new
worry
ought
he
to
tell
the
cobles
about
his
mother
supposing
he
really
thought
of
but
no
he
did
not
think
of
and
in
any
case
there
was
no
use
in
raking
up
unpleasant
matters
he
had
not
inherited
her
dementia
it
was
not
in
her
blood
it
had
grown
up
gradually
from
the
sad
narrow
circumstances
of
her
lot
it
was
his
father
that
he
took
after
he
was
not
mad
he
was
more
likely
to
go
mad
if
he
continued
his
terrible
solitary
struggle
unless
indeed
and
here
came
a
sudden
vision
of
a
scene
that
had
lain
forgotten
for
long
years
unless
indeed
mad
peggy
had
been
right
mad
matt
oh
no
it
was
madness
to
attach
any
meaning
to
the
words
never
had
he
felt
so
sane
he
got
up
and
looked
into
the
dusty
glass
on
the
that
was
not
the
face
of
a
madman
she
had
prophesied
he
would
never
be
happy
never
never
he
would
thirst
and
thirst
for
happiness
but
never
would
he
quench
his
thirst
ah
the
crazy
creature
was
right
there
anyhow
he
watched
with
curious
interest
the
tears
rolling
down
the
face
in
the
mirror
well
be
it
so
he
was
strong
he
could
dispense
with
happiness
he
would
not
go
to
the
that
evening
he
would
leave
halifax
and
join
his
folks
in
cobequid
at
last
they
would
all
live
out
their
lives
together
poor
victims
of
a
common
destiny
he
would
work
on
the
farm
he
would
rent
more
land
he
would
make
it
pay
his
uncle
had
been
right
all
along
why
had
he
not
taken
his
advice
and
stayed
on
at
farm
ah
well
his
dream
of
art
was
over
now
he
was
getting
on
in
years
the
energy
had
been
buffeted
out
of
him
one
could
not
always
be
young
and
ambitious
he
would
never
be
famous
now
he
would
toil
obscurely
like
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
his
bones
would
lie
with
theirs
in
the
little
lonesome
among
the
pines
it
did
not
matter
nothing
mattered
death
would
shovel
them
all
away
soon
enough
he
lay
down
on
the
bed
again
near
it
stood
a
with
a
piece
of
ragged
sponge
upon
it
his
eye
noted
a
patch
of
light
on
the
sponge
and
he
wondered
how
the
sunshine
had
got
there
then
he
perceived
the
yellow
patch
was
only
a
reflection
from
the
and
his
thoughts
turned
to
the
problem
of
painting
sunlight
by
optical
illusion
he
thought
of
cornpepper
and
the
fellows
and
all
the
happy
discussions
he
had
had
in
london
the
afternoon
waned
into
evening
the
patch
of
mock
sunshine
faded
the
shadows
gathered
shrouding
the
walls
with
mystery
he
grew
faint
with
hunger
in
the
dusk
there
opened
out
a
picture
of
a
room
with
a
snowy
cloth
on
its
round
table
and
a
plump
figure
with
soft
blue
eyes
presiding
over
the
savory
dishes
the
vision
drew
him
he
rose
washed
himself
carefully
and
went
out
a
month
later
a
week
before
his
marriage
matt
strang
journeyed
to
cobequid
to
see
his
folks
and
bid
them
farewell
before
leaving
for
his
artistic
in
europe
he
had
written
the
news
home
but
they
could
not
afford
to
come
to
halifax
for
the
wedding
and
so
he
had
promised
to
run
down
before
starting
on
his
second
voyage
in
search
of
art
he
alighted
from
the
coach
at
cobequid
village
overwhelmed
with
emotion
resolved
to
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
towards
the
joyous
reunion
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
he
wished
to
note
each
familiar
landmark
the
fields
the
farms
the
stores
the
little
all
the
beloved
features
of
the
spacious
scattered
wooden
metropolis
of
his
childhood
it
was
almost
noon
and
the
landscape
seen
through
the
waves
of
hot
air
rising
from
the
soil
quivered
in
the
heat
the
white
farmhouses
glittered
the
paint
of
the
verandas
bulged
out
the
wooden
spire
of
the
pointed
piously
to
a
heaven
of
stainless
blue
in
the
the
fowls
lolled
prostrate
on
their
sides
with
open
mouths
and
drooping
wings
their
tongues
protruding
their
eyes
closed
their
legs
every
now
and
then
uneasily
stirring
up
the
dust
under
their
wings
the
cattle
and
horses
stood
deep
in
pools
under
the
trees
the
bumblebees
droned
sleepily
about
the
wild
roses
of
the
or
buzzed
among
the
and
yellow
buttercups
and
dandelions
that
mottled
the
the
red
squirrels
chattered
on
the
spruces
as
they
sat
shelling
cones
their
tails
curved
over
their
backs
the
woodpeckers
tapped
on
the
hollow
stubs
the
screamed
among
the
branches
a
hawk
circled
tranquilly
upward
to
a
speck
then
sailed
softly
downward
with
motionless
wings
outspread
in
the
fields
men
were
hoeing
potatoes
following
the
slow
oxen
that
dragged
the
ploughs
between
the
furrows
and
heaping
up
the
earth
with
leisurely
monotonous
movements
belated
sowers
of
buckwheat
were
scattering
the
triangular
grains
with
a
slow
measured
hypnotic
motion
in
the
sultry
stores
there
was
nothing
doing
now
and
then
a
in
his
spat
solemnly
or
drawled
a
lazy
monosyllable
behind
a
casement
a
slumbrous
old
crone
snuffed
herself
a
wagon
rumbled
dustily
beneath
the
overarching
trees
the
village
drowsed
in
the
sun
high
noon
the
conches
began
sounding
to
call
the
to
dinner
and
every
sign
of
labor
melted
away
the
languor
crept
over
the
young
pedestrian
a
perception
of
the
futility
of
ambition
flooded
his
soul
like
a
wave
of
summer
sea
soft
and
warm
and
bitter
to
pass
through
life
tranquil
and
obscure
amid
the
simplicities
and
sanctities
of
childish
custom
with
work
and
rest
with
and
sunday
to
walk
in
ways
amid
the
same
fragrant
to
the
music
of
the
same
birds
hand
in
hand
with
a
daughter
of
the
same
soil
to
whom
every
hoar
usage
and
green
meadow
should
be
similarly
dear
to
carry
on
the
chain
of
the
quiet
generations
and
so
pass
lingeringly
towards
a
forgotten
grave
amid
humble
kinsfolk
were
not
this
sweeter
than
the
trump
and
glare
of
fame
and
the
ache
of
ambition
and
the
loneliness
of
untrodden
footways
he
seemed
to
hear
mad
mocking
laughter
in
the
distance
he
moved
curiously
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds
skirting
a
new
building
which
blocked
his
view
and
which
he
saw
from
a
notice
was
a
baptist
such
as
his
mother
had
always
yearned
for
met
his
gaze
still
standing
in
its
field
and
in
the
foreground
a
mob
of
boys
and
girls
shouting
and
laughing
with
the
exuberance
of
just
let
out
after
a
moment
he
perceived
that
they
were
jeering
and
hooting
somebody
then
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
ungainly
figure
of
a
young
man
in
the
centre
of
derision
with
a
dozen
hands
playfully
pulling
and
pushing
him
the
poor
butt
fell
down
and
there
was
a
great
outburst
of
hilarious
delight
blood
boiled
he
ran
quickly
forward
towards
the
booing
juvenile
crowd
which
scattered
a
little
at
the
sight
of
his
flaming
countenance
pesky
little
he
cried
then
his
voice
failed
with
a
flash
of
horror
he
recognized
his
brother
billy
recommenced
one
of
the
bigger
louts
rum
matt
seized
the
crutch
which
lay
at
the
side
of
the
prostrate
drunken
cripple
and
described
a
threatening
circle
with
it
the
pack
of
children
broke
up
and
made
off
hooting
from
a
safer
distance
he
said
hoarsely
clutching
the
wretched
young
fellow
by
the
half
to
raise
him
half
in
instinctive
anger
returning
intelligence
struggled
with
the
look
of
maudlin
pathos
on
white
face
the
shock
of
the
sight
of
his
brother
sobered
him
he
suffered
himself
to
be
lifted
to
his
feet
then
he
took
his
crutch
and
moved
forward
refusing
further
help
kin
walk
he
said
sullenly
the
tone
and
accent
grated
on
ear
but
a
pang
of
mixed
with
his
wrath
and
disgust
it
was
his
part
to
have
looked
after
billy
better
expect
we
should
meet
like
this
billy
he
said
softly
should
hev
come
sooner
billy
retorted
of
about
all
the
world
over
yourself
and
never
nigh
us
not
even
when
you
were
in
the
province
with
your
portraits
your
never
was
near
enough
and
i
always
had
to
move
on
he
explained
gently
as
he
flicked
the
dust
of
the
road
off
coat
mind
my
clothes
they
spoil
not
so
fine
as
yours
if
to
walk
with
me
talk
like
that
billy
only
glad
to
see
how
well
you
can
the
brothers
passed
defiantly
through
the
straggling
remnants
of
the
juvenile
crowd
walked
to
the
village
said
billy
strong
enough
to
go
anywhere
a
few
hoots
recommenced
in
the
rear
wish
you
gone
to
the
village
sighed
matt
why
i
cried
billy
pricked
to
savagery
again
is
there
for
me
but
drunk
i
got
drunk
when
you
wrote
the
news
so
i
did
thet
was
the
first
time
we
all
drank
your
health
your
i
got
drunk
glad
i
found
out
the
joy
of
it
why
i
hev
some
pleasure
too
never
hev
a
bride
of
my
own
certain
what
girl
would
take
me
do
you
deny
it
why
even
when
ruth
hailey
was
here
she
pitied
we
better
get
a
lift
said
matt
gently
for
a
carriage
was
rumbling
behind
them
been
twice
to
the
since
the
money
came
pursued
billy
in
dogged
defiance
the
way
to
forgit
he
stumped
on
sturdily
beads
of
perspiration
glistened
on
his
white
bloodless
face
money
came
matt
asked
puzzled
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
you
sent
a
couple
of
days
after
you
got
never
sent
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
he
cried
you
billy
opened
his
large
pathetic
eyes
wider
now
funny
we
wondered
why
you
did
it
so
curiously
and
why
the
postmark
was
maine
we
thought
you
were
up
to
some
fun
now
you
had
so
much
money
but
we
allowed
wait
till
you
but
matt
could
not
solve
the
mystery
the
notes
had
been
addressed
to
strangs
and
were
accompanied
by
a
slip
of
paper
same
amount
of
the
money
due
to
you
will
be
forwarded
next
that
was
all
the
message
matt
exhausted
himself
in
guesses
his
thoughts
even
went
back
to
the
owners
of
the
imagining
some
tardy
in
repayment
of
arrears
due
to
the
dead
captain
at
last
he
concluded
the
remittance
must
have
come
from
madame
strang
acting
through
some
american
agent
she
had
discovered
herbert
owed
him
money
and
was
sending
him
double
and
quadruple
by
way
of
remorse
for
the
mistake
she
and
her
husband
had
made
to
prevent
him
from
returning
it
she
had
sent
it
to
his
family
and
anonymously
abner
preep
contended
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
matt
to
help
his
brothers
and
sisters
further
for
the
present
the
subsidy
was
ample
more
would
only
lead
to
unnecessary
extravagance
matt
was
not
entirely
pleased
to
find
his
family
had
no
immediate
need
to
profit
by
his
marriage
indeed
he
almost
wished
the
money
had
not
come
it
was
perturbing
to
feel
in
himself
a
yearning
now
that
his
burdens
were
lightened
to
make
one
last
desperate
effort
to
take
the
kingdom
of
art
by
his
own
unaided
assault
it
was
even
more
perturbing
to
feel
himself
solicited
by
that
other
self
which
had
spoken
out
on
that
sultry
summer
afternoon
to
abandon
art
altogether
for
the
simple
restfulness
of
a
life
in
his
own
village
at
one
with
nature
the
life
that
had
cramped
him
once
seemed
curiously
soothing
now
his
old
fretful
sense
of
superiority
to
this
philistine
environment
was
gone
but
most
perturbing
of
all
was
the
thought
of
rosina
in
neither
of
these
suggested
alternatives
to
have
another
try
alone
or
to
settle
down
in
cobequid
did
she
play
any
part
and
he
always
came
back
with
a
shock
to
the
recollection
of
his
relation
to
her
that
made
both
of
these
futures
impossible
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
dwell
for
a
moment
on
the
thought
of
backing
out
of
his
engagement
honor
forbade
that
and
was
he
even
certain
that
he
did
not
care
for
her
how
piquant
she
had
looked
now
and
then
when
she
had
accidentally
got
into
one
or
other
of
the
two
postures
that
became
her
best
as
on
the
night
when
smiling
she
had
thrown
back
her
head
a
little
to
the
left
with
the
somewhat
plebeian
nose
refined
by
foreshortening
and
the
warm
carmines
and
ivory
of
the
face
and
throat
showing
in
the
lamplight
against
the
loosened
hair
and
then
how
simple
and
unpretentious
she
was
how
charmingly
candid
her
chafferings
with
the
but
it
eased
his
mind
somewhat
to
find
billy
selfishly
laying
claim
to
the
mysterious
money
persisting
he
would
travel
with
it
he
would
see
the
world
matt
persuaded
harriet
to
acquiescence
in
the
idea
relieved
to
find
his
immediate
responsibilities
to
the
smaller
children
restored
to
him
but
unknown
to
billy
matt
had
already
decided
he
must
if
possible
take
charge
of
the
poor
fellow
and
keep
him
from
drink
he
wrote
to
ask
permission
to
let
his
crippled
brother
travel
with
him
as
his
health
needed
a
sea
voyage
he
waited
anxiously
for
the
reply
can
reffuse
my
darling
nothing
rosina
responded
with
more
promptitude
than
orthography
bless
you
murmured
matt
kissing
the
letter
believe
i
shall
love
you
after
book
chapter
i
conqueror
or
conquered
foresight
is
insight
it
was
due
to
matthew
ignorance
of
life
and
of
himself
that
his
marriage
in
no
way
turned
out
as
he
had
calculated
oh
the
fatal
mistake
of
it
perceived
as
soon
as
it
was
too
late
though
he
shrank
weakly
from
the
perception
afraid
to
face
the
chill
blank
truth
hoping
against
hope
that
love
would
be
the
child
of
marriage
oh
the
ghastliness
of
being
chained
to
a
loving
woman
he
did
not
love
bound
by
law
and
honor
to
simulate
a
responsive
affection
and
to
hide
the
deadly
apathy
which
her
caresses
could
not
overcome
he
tried
hard
to
love
her
calling
his
own
attention
to
her
youth
her
freshness
her
prettiness
her
flashes
of
expression
making
the
most
of
every
hint
of
charm
seeing
her
through
a
wilful
glamour
even
attempting
to
persuade
himself
that
she
was
the
woman
of
his
dreams
all
the
while
his
leaden
heart
coldly
refusing
itself
to
the
hollow
pretence
before
the
marriage
he
had
almost
felt
on
the
point
of
love
but
it
was
only
he
knew
later
the
of
cupidity
and
mercenariness
though
no
doubt
a
measure
of
gratitude
had
helped
to
becloud
his
vision
in
his
bachelor
days
he
could
never
have
imagined
such
indifference
to
any
woman
sometimes
he
wondered
if
this
was
all
marriage
meant
to
any
man
but
a
wistful
incredulity
denied
him
the
consolation
of
acquiescence
in
a
common
lot
the
testimony
of
mankind
was
quite
other
and
his
own
yearning
instinct
refused
to
look
upon
his
union
as
typical
if
only
she
had
been
a
little
more
intellectual
less
limited
to
gossip
about
servants
and
prices
how
he
had
deceived
himself
taking
the
sprightliness
of
a
young
girl
in
love
the
coquettish
gayety
the
evanescent
brilliancy
of
a
bird
in
the
pairing
season
for
the
output
of
perennial
intellect
and
he
had
lived
so
much
alone
with
his
dreams
that
he
had
fallen
out
of
touch
with
humanity
and
particularly
with
feminine
humanity
he
had
had
no
standard
of
comparison
by
which
to
gauge
her
and
once
united
to
her
the
habitual
recluse
could
not
accommodate
himself
to
her
constant
companionship
what
an
irony
their
in
paris
in
florence
the
ardors
of
artistic
renascence
yoked
with
the
blankness
of
boredom
despite
affectionate
clinging
to
him
and
her
almost
pathetic
endeavor
to
admire
old
churches
and
dingy
it
was
a
relief
to
both
when
she
at
last
acquiesced
in
his
happy
idea
of
regarding
his
rounds
as
and
under
the
convoy
of
billy
beguiled
the
expectation
of
fonder
reunion
by
the
more
exhilarating
spectacle
of
the
streets
and
the
endless
glories
of
the
and
very
soon
she
wearied
altogether
of
foreign
places
clamoring
to
be
settled
in
london
where
the
language
was
not
gibberish
and
one
could
go
without
being
bamboozled
and
cut
off
from
bargaining
for
after
the
first
fervors
of
the
she
had
developed
that
instinct
for
petty
economy
which
had
amused
and
charmed
him
when
he
had
gone
shopping
with
her
in
halifax
but
which
now
fretted
him
seeming
like
a
daily
reproach
for
all
those
great
sums
her
acquisition
of
him
had
cost
her
he
was
glad
that
the
due
arrival
of
the
second
mysterious
instalment
promised
to
the
household
relieved
him
of
the
painful
necessity
of
applying
to
her
on
its
behalf
unexpectedly
enough
this
sum
was
supplemented
by
a
dividend
of
a
hundred
and
fifteen
dollars
paid
to
him
after
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
matter
by
the
trustee
in
halifax
in
settlement
of
his
claim
against
the
estate
of
the
starsborough
in
vain
he
tried
to
interest
his
wife
in
books
in
the
poems
and
essays
in
the
study
of
french
and
german
into
which
he
now
threw
himself
with
a
feverish
desire
for
culture
in
vain
he
tried
to
impart
to
her
his
vision
of
nature
to
get
her
to
observe
scenery
and
sunsets
colors
and
shades
were
only
interesting
to
her
as
they
occurred
in
dress
materials
once
when
they
stood
by
a
on
a
december
afternoon
under
a
cold
gray
sky
and
rosina
complained
of
the
dreariness
of
the
seascape
he
had
attempted
to
show
her
how
beautiful
it
really
was
how
much
more
interesting
to
the
artistic
eye
than
a
crude
sunlight
effect
how
nearest
the
horizon
it
was
grayish
and
then
a
still
amber
and
then
emerald
green
and
how
just
before
the
final
fringe
of
both
there
shone
a
band
of
sparkling
amber
grayed
by
but
rosina
shivered
and
refused
to
see
anything
but
a
chill
green
waste
she
would
not
even
allow
him
to
arrange
her
furniture
and
a
pair
of
colossal
pink
vases
garishly
with
pastoral
figures
picked
up
were
a
permanent
pain
to
him
spoiling
for
him
the
of
the
little
north
london
house
with
the
rude
whitewashed
studio
in
which
they
had
settled
down
after
the
birth
of
their
first
child
the
temporary
lull
that
attended
their
installation
in
british
domesticity
was
succeeded
by
graver
frictions
when
rosina
had
finished
furnishing
they
had
no
society
neither
of
the
couple
knew
anybody
in
london
and
the
husband
shrank
from
making
friends
constrained
moreover
by
his
art
to
a
solitary
way
of
living
rosina
who
before
her
child
demanded
her
care
had
sat
to
him
out
of
pure
desire
to
be
with
him
began
to
be
jealous
of
the
models
who
replaced
her
declaring
that
she
had
had
no
conception
such
were
a
part
of
art
or
she
would
never
have
married
him
the
only
alleviation
of
his
numb
misery
was
his
ability
to
paint
without
pecuniary
the
picture
with
which
he
was
to
storm
the
academy
to
throw
all
his
individuality
into
it
the
very
seclusion
of
his
life
favored
this
devotion
to
his
ideals
and
these
ideals
were
only
partially
those
of
his
celibate
he
had
been
swaying
to
and
fro
under
the
opposite
solicitations
of
idealism
and
realism
now
in
a
violent
upheaval
his
sympathy
with
modern
subjects
and
even
with
modern
methods
had
been
submerged
on
the
continent
for
the
first
time
he
came
into
contact
with
the
old
world
london
had
been
to
him
as
modern
as
america
repeating
its
ideas
and
ideals
but
in
france
and
more
especially
in
italy
the
mere
variation
of
tongues
helped
to
draw
him
into
an
earlier
world
with
the
appeal
of
ancient
churches
and
streets
and
palaces
and
the
countless
treasure
of
ancient
art
the
modern
world
grew
hateful
to
him
and
he
absorbed
by
affinity
the
ancient
and
the
mediæval
at
bottom
it
was
not
so
much
the
modern
that
repelled
him
as
real
life
and
it
was
not
so
much
the
past
towards
which
he
yearned
as
towards
that
timeless
realm
wherein
ideal
beauty
dwells
the
past
was
at
least
less
real
than
the
present
real
life
was
horrible
and
marriage
had
put
the
on
his
dissatisfaction
with
it
from
birth
to
death
it
was
embased
by
a
sordid
series
of
physical
processes
even
the
love
was
hideous
at
root
beauty
itself
was
never
really
perfect
and
was
transient
at
best
while
the
beautiful
idea
that
lurked
in
nearly
every
human
face
and
figure
had
for
the
most
part
been
left
embryonic
only
in
art
could
the
imperfections
of
nature
be
corrected
and
this
was
the
mission
not
to
imitate
nature
but
to
transcend
her
from
her
faulty
individuals
frail
and
perishable
to
draw
types
of
perfection
flawless
immortal
like
that
venus
de
milo
which
stood
at
the
end
of
the
louvre
passage
beautiful
from
every
standpoint
fixing
in
its
pensive
sweetness
of
spiritualized
form
his
dream
of
ideal
womanhood
or
like
that
mighty
torso
of
winged
victory
that
had
achieved
the
last
victory
over
its
own
mutilation
real
life
was
deacon
hailey
and
his
mad
mother
and
billy
and
rosina
and
his
uncle
and
the
grimy
denizens
of
the
london
slums
and
the
blackguardly
crowd
at
the
fleet
street
and
the
lewd
workmen
in
the
starsborough
but
art
was
rosalind
and
imogen
hamlet
and
ariel
don
quixote
and
beatrix
esmond
and
the
love
in
lyrics
and
the
music
of
beethoven
and
the
pictures
of
botticelli
and
the
cold
white
statues
of
the
greeks
that
imaginary
world
which
soul
had
called
into
being
to
redress
the
balance
of
the
real
it
was
art
against
nature
throughout
the
immortal
shadows
against
the
ephemeral
realities
can
not
fade
though
thou
hast
not
thy
bliss
forever
wilt
thou
love
and
she
be
and
so
for
the
of
cornpepper
he
no
longer
cared
what
mattered
the
realities
of
space
more
than
those
of
time
to
the
soul
emperor
of
its
own
fantasy
all
this
scientific
precision
after
which
he
had
been
hankering
was
it
not
irrelevant
to
art
the
beautiful
was
the
ideal
to
create
the
ideal
the
real
must
be
passed
through
the
crucible
of
the
soul
the
artist
was
the
true
creator
in
him
yearning
to
beget
the
beautiful
became
conscious
she
herself
had
infinite
failures
ugly
moods
fogs
glooms
skies
of
iron
seas
of
tin
and
feeling
all
this
instinctively
rather
than
by
a
lucid
excogitation
he
was
now
for
the
ideal
for
the
romantic
for
the
religious
even
for
anything
that
was
not
real
that
shut
out
the
unbeautiful
necessity
as
those
glorious
stained
windows
of
cathedrals
blazing
with
saints
shut
out
the
crude
daylight
and
the
raw
air
of
reality
filtering
the
garish
sunlight
to
that
dim
religious
light
in
which
the
soul
could
see
best
ah
how
wisely
the
poor
human
soul
had
fenced
itself
in
against
the
bleak
realities
even
as
the
body
had
housed
itself
against
the
inhospitalities
of
nature
painting
its
windows
with
beautiful
dreams
with
an
incarnate
love
that
ruled
the
world
and
an
image
of
immaculate
motherhood
and
in
a
strange
hybrid
hazy
blend
of
catholicism
and
hellenism
possible
only
to
an
artist
who
sees
things
by
their
sensuous
outsides
the
venus
de
milo
and
the
madonna
of
the
italian
masters
were
to
him
more
akin
by
beauty
than
divorced
by
dogma
in
a
sense
they
were
one
the
highest
types
of
beauty
conceivable
by
the
pagan
and
christian
ages
so
akin
that
when
botticelli
came
to
draw
venus
as
in
his
di
venere
his
brush
fashioned
a
meek
miltonic
eve
prefiguring
the
virgin
mother
while
andrea
del
sarto
in
his
annunziazone
in
the
had
given
the
virgin
mother
almost
the
brooding
serenity
of
a
greek
goddess
ideal
womanhood
ideal
womanhood
this
was
what
poor
matthew
strang
seemed
to
find
in
either
ay
and
even
in
and
the
saying
of
keats
is
truth
truth
beauty
seemed
to
him
to
be
indeed
all
that
mortals
needed
to
know
but
that
pagan
serenity
which
had
produced
greek
art
could
not
be
his
for
him
as
for
the
ages
the
first
sensuous
joy
in
beauty
was
over
and
what
appealed
even
more
than
the
greek
marbles
to
the
artist
who
had
set
out
from
his
native
village
with
quick
blood
worshipper
of
a
beautiful
world
was
that
subtler
art
which
expressed
rather
the
inadequacy
than
the
perfection
of
life
the
wistfulness
of
a
botticelli
madonna
the
unfathomable
smile
of
a
leonardo
portrait
the
pensive
melancholy
of
lorenzo
di
in
the
uffizi
or
the
mystic
aspiration
of
the
monk
in
that
famous
di
musica
and
inversely
lovelier
line
than
and
michael
with
its
more
majestic
sweep
he
longed
with
that
yearning
with
which
the
boy
had
looked
up
to
the
stars
in
the
midnight
forest
for
god
for
christ
for
apollo
for
some
dream
of
whiteness
and
beauty
for
something
that
persisted
beneath
all
the
purposeless
generations
of
which
the
louvre
held
record
in
those
cumbrous
relics
of
vanished
civilization
egyptian
phœnician
syrian
babylonian
persian
chaldean
those
broken
shafts
of
pillars
that
had
upheld
barbaric
temples
those
friezes
that
had
adorned
the
façades
of
palaces
those
blurred
monuments
perpetuating
the
victories
of
forgotten
dust
those
faded
that
had
pleased
the
lustful
eyes
of
nameless
kings
enthroned
in
their
gigantic
halls
those
uncouth
torsos
of
bulls
and
sphinxes
emblems
of
a
vaster
crueller
life
amid
the
flux
of
the
centuries
the
visibles
of
art
the
invisibles
of
religion
were
not
these
the
only
true
realities
such
had
been
matthew
thoughts
as
in
a
deep
silence
he
walked
through
the
louvre
with
rosina
a
silence
that
was
at
its
deepest
when
he
responded
to
her
chatter
she
hated
the
slippery
parquet
and
the
dull
under
the
glazed
skylight
preferring
the
fresh
coloring
of
the
copies
though
she
made
fun
of
the
copyists
who
sat
so
patiently
on
their
stools
what
queer
men
what
funny
frumpy
girls
what
strange
old
ladies
and
look
there
was
a
young
woman
in
weeds
painting
such
a
cute
picture
and
gracious
there
was
quite
a
young
girl
copying
a
naked
man
they
horrid
the
french
she
liked
the
cocked
hats
with
a
dash
of
gilt
and
enjoyed
the
desultory
crowd
of
perambulating
spectators
that
ranged
from
old
gentlemen
hobbling
along
on
sticks
to
artisans
in
red
blouses
and
clayey
boots
and
matt
come
back
into
the
jewelry
and
china
departments
which
were
really
interesting
and
the
heat
unbearable
it
was
her
restlessness
that
made
her
husband
quit
this
paris
which
fascinated
him
this
beautiful
city
with
whose
artistic
activity
divined
from
the
mere
architecture
of
the
école
des
beaux
arts
he
had
had
no
opportunity
to
get
into
intimate
touch
for
he
could
not
even
come
across
herbert
whom
he
had
rather
hoped
to
find
still
there
a
cicerone
to
initiate
him
into
the
of
paris
in
florence
where
they
went
for
the
winter
rosina
was
even
more
restless
the
towered
palaces
the
duomo
and
the
gracious
campaniles
the
gardens
the
enchanting
environs
and
all
the
stock
wonders
of
the
place
had
none
but
a
superficial
interest
for
her
they
were
exhausted
at
first
sight
amid
the
marble
calm
of
colonnades
she
even
regretted
the
liveliness
of
the
boulevards
and
the
climate
too
was
worse
than
that
of
paris
her
grumblings
were
perpetual
to
pass
from
the
warm
piazza
or
promenade
to
the
biting
wind
of
the
narrow
streets
was
not
only
uncomfortable
but
made
it
a
problem
how
to
dress
and
indeed
matt
himself
suffered
keenly
from
the
cold
though
there
was
a
small
brass
heating
apparatus
in
the
centre
of
the
gallery
it
scarcely
did
more
than
keep
his
colors
from
congealing
for
he
was
copying
with
the
child
and
yes
botticelli
had
become
his
master
botticelli
whom
at
first
sight
in
the
national
gallery
he
had
rejected
for
insufficient
draughtsmanship
but
all
of
whose
naïve
exaggerations
of
hands
or
feet
or
necks
he
now
credited
to
artistic
intention
prepared
to
maintain
from
loving
study
of
his
delicately
luminous
canvases
and
his
blond
ethereal
frescos
that
the
drawing
had
only
repudiated
the
bonds
of
the
real
in
quest
of
a
higher
beauty
a
more
gracious
harmony
of
curves
even
as
his
coloring
had
refined
away
that
oleaginous
quality
which
a
rubens
found
in
human
flesh
to
brood
over
a
madonna
of
botticelli
or
of
filippo
lippi
matthew
strang
would
turn
from
the
women
of
rubens
or
the
young
men
of
titian
or
the
children
of
velasquez
or
old
men
though
at
the
sight
of
of
millet
he
felt
a
lurking
sympathy
in
his
submerged
self
he
preferred
that
morning
landscape
of
corot
in
which
bodiceless
beauties
dance
round
trees
as
women
never
did
in
any
period
of
french
history
he
found
a
winter
scene
of
van
none
the
less
charming
because
the
figures
were
not
enveloped
and
the
lights
were
untruly
set
off
by
bituminous
shadows
he
was
in
the
mood
in
which
even
the
gilded
of
the
eighteenth
century
seemed
precious
amid
the
infinitude
of
art
that
surrounded
him
now
cocksureness
seemed
to
him
as
futile
as
it
had
already
appeared
amid
the
infinity
of
nature
and
all
the
masters
were
so
akin
that
evolution
by
revolution
seemed
less
credible
than
in
the
smoky
atmosphere
of
azure
art
studios
modern
subject
had
they
not
all
done
the
contemporary
had
the
dutch
done
anything
else
impressionism
in
so
far
as
it
meant
a
free
was
not
rembrandt
an
impressionist
was
not
velasquez
in
his
later
manner
his
first
picture
then
need
not
be
revolutionary
in
technique
but
it
must
be
more
imaginative
than
the
bulk
of
english
work
in
the
academy
of
his
day
more
emotional
photography
had
reduced
realism
to
absurdity
had
proved
that
art
lay
in
the
transfusion
of
nature
through
the
soul
and
the
essence
of
all
art
was
emotion
feeling
the
work
of
art
was
but
the
medium
by
which
the
artist
passed
on
his
emotion
to
the
spectator
his
joy
in
beauty
his
feeling
for
nature
his
sadness
his
aspiration
even
his
view
of
life
because
emotion
could
be
conveyed
by
literature
and
music
there
was
no
reason
why
these
should
have
the
preference
in
cases
where
painting
was
equal
to
conveying
it
too
without
emotion
a
picture
was
null
and
void
technique
by
itself
could
give
works
of
craft
never
works
of
art
on
the
other
hand
to
have
the
artistic
emotion
without
the
technique
necessary
to
pass
it
on
to
the
spectator
was
to
be
artistic
but
not
an
artist
the
choice
of
a
subject
gave
him
much
harassing
hesitation
it
brought
delicious
peace
merely
to
make
his
final
decision
amid
all
the
whirl
of
ideas
that
pressed
upon
him
he
would
found
his
picture
on
those
beautiful
lines
in
matthew
she
sat
with
you
and
me
on
a
throne
in
the
heart
of
the
sea
and
the
youngest
sat
on
her
knee
she
combed
its
bright
hair
and
she
tended
it
well
when
down
swung
the
sound
of
a
bell
she
sighed
she
up
through
the
clear
green
sea
she
said
must
go
for
my
kinsfolk
pray
in
the
little
gray
church
on
the
shore
be
in
the
world
ah
me
and
i
lose
my
poor
soul
merman
here
with
the
subject
seemed
to
him
made
to
his
hand
it
would
enable
him
to
fulfil
his
young
ambitious
dream
of
reconciling
the
decorative
with
the
the
composition
should
weave
a
beautiful
pattern
and
the
coloring
a
scheme
of
harmony
and
yet
the
picture
should
make
a
distinct
emotional
appeal
a
woman
with
a
soul
throned
amid
a
lower
race
yet
yearning
for
the
higher
spiritual
fervors
that
was
an
idea
which
lent
itself
beautifully
to
pictorial
expression
a
literary
idea
doubtless
but
yet
a
visual
too
so
that
there
was
no
need
even
to
label
it
with
the
lines
which
had
suggested
it
it
should
be
and
what
sensuous
glow
in
the
accessories
the
clear
green
the
throne
the
flowing
hair
the
thought
of
them
was
like
wine
in
his
veins
he
set
to
work
eagerly
on
a
large
scale
informed
by
his
contemplation
of
the
old
masters
with
big
ambitions
to
do
not
the
little
lyrics
that
satisfied
contemporary
cocksureness
but
a
great
sustained
poem
what
pleasures
and
pains
the
work
brought
him
the
thrill
of
conception
was
deadened
by
inadequacy
of
execution
to
revive
when
some
charm
of
color
and
line
flowered
under
happy
accident
he
had
great
joy
in
doing
the
heart
of
the
sea
with
its
divine
dark
it
was
his
sympathy
with
this
marine
that
had
partly
inspired
his
readiness
to
do
old
misleading
ensign
of
the
shark
and
the
around
the
throne
of
the
bride
that
stood
on
the
the
submarine
flora
bloomed
in
strange
fantastic
arabesques
and
subtle
shades
of
amber
and
gray
and
white
and
crimson
and
through
the
green
translucent
water
spent
sunbeams
quivered
and
gleamed
and
vague
tropical
fish
shot
lovely
notes
of
color
and
a
coiled
its
glittering
mail
and
there
were
strange
pied
amorphous
creatures
and
corallines
and
madrepores
and
gleaming
shells
and
touched
with
purple
and
azure
yet
all
strictly
subordinated
to
the
two
central
figures
of
the
composition
the
throned
woman
with
her
youngest
on
her
knee
which
despite
the
nudity
and
the
strange
accessories
took
on
a
curious
likeness
to
the
madonna
and
child
the
canvas
indeed
showed
the
influence
upon
him
of
those
wistful
madonnas
he
had
pored
over
so
wistfully
the
cold
strange
eyes
of
the
child
were
in
the
imaginative
vein
of
the
poem
the
form
of
the
throned
woman
was
inspired
by
merely
pagan
ideals
of
beauty
and
yet
the
yearning
in
her
uplifted
eyes
for
the
world
of
prayer
whose
sound
floated
mystically
down
to
her
was
the
same
that
showed
in
the
eyes
of
the
holy
mother
but
this
analogy
was
not
consciously
in
the
design
though
it
had
doubtless
influenced
his
choice
of
subject
nor
though
he
had
certainly
had
in
mind
to
suggest
through
her
the
yearning
of
humanity
for
a
higher
world
did
he
connect
his
work
with
the
school
of
symbolists
which
was
just
arising
across
the
channel
and
which
was
capable
of
finding
in
the
dominant
green
of
his
sea
the
of
resurrection
even
the
dead
face
which
he
had
placed
in
a
corner
in
the
foreground
though
it
might
well
seem
symbolic
of
the
tragedy
lurking
amid
this
sensuous
beauty
was
in
truth
only
the
dead
face
of
his
father
and
he
had
put
it
in
less
for
its
symbolic
significance
or
its
realistic
appositeness
than
from
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
have
it
there
as
though
thus
to
dispossess
his
mind
of
that
ancient
haunting
image
which
the
continuous
thought
of
the
sea
had
inevitably
brought
up
again
he
told
himself
it
was
but
natural
some
drowned
face
should
bob
ghastly
in
this
submarine
paradise
but
in
reality
he
felt
a
morbid
craving
to
put
it
there
to
have
something
in
his
picture
for
himself
alone
that
no
one
else
in
the
great
wide
world
could
possibly
understand
to
the
full
for
the
rest
the
picture
cost
him
infinite
trouble
for
his
genius
was
an
incapacity
for
not
taking
infinite
pains
the
poetry
of
paint
is
achieved
by
the
prose
of
work
and
as
despite
his
romanticism
his
hankerings
for
the
real
persisted
his
ambitious
conception
entailed
much
preliminary
study
and
the
setting
up
in
his
studio
of
a
little
aquarium
in
the
construction
of
which
his
ancient
experience
at
the
stepney
establishment
in
making
cases
of
shells
with
mosses
and
and
coral
came
in
unexpectedly
useful
but
he
could
not
get
a
satisfactory
model
for
his
principal
figure
and
curiously
enough
her
left
hand
gave
him
more
vexation
than
anything
else
in
this
complex
composition
he
could
not
settle
its
pose
scraped
out
finger
after
finger
with
an
old
knife
relic
of
his
voyage
specially
ground
down
painted
out
the
whole
hand
fourteen
times
and
at
last
in
despair
weakly
solved
the
problem
by
hiding
the
hand
altogether
two
days
later
working
on
the
scales
of
the
that
basked
sinuously
at
the
feet
he
suddenly
had
a
last
furious
dash
at
the
refractory
hand
this
time
it
came
right
and
brought
rejoicing
sometimes
he
seemed
at
the
mercy
of
these
haphazard
inspirations
what
came
came
quite
irrespective
of
conscious
will
and
training
ixh
as
i
can
the
old
flemish
motto
which
van
eyck
put
to
his
work
seemed
to
him
apt
for
any
painter
when
he
began
he
was
already
much
more
exigent
towards
himself
than
in
his
younger
days
had
checked
that
fearless
execution
by
the
time
he
had
finished
his
picture
those
very
months
of
steady
work
rigorously
revised
had
raised
his
ideal
higher
so
that
though
the
actual
picture
pretty
well
corresponded
with
his
first
conception
it
was
still
far
removed
from
his
later
standard
the
expression
of
the
face
seemed
especially
inadequate
and
as
great
actresses
do
not
sit
as
models
and
the
artist
has
to
imagine
emotional
expression
he
felt
again
despite
his
romanticism
that
he
had
missed
the
subtleties
of
reality
but
every
genus
of
art
has
to
sacrifice
something
and
day
was
drawing
swiftly
nigh
and
he
had
to
lay
down
his
brushes
at
last
and
through
his
despatch
the
canvas
to
burlington
house
and
await
with
what
composure
he
could
the
verdict
that
should
bring
him
the
recognition
he
had
struggled
for
during
such
long
tedious
years
now
that
the
absorbing
task
was
over
he
had
time
to
think
of
its
reward
to
dwell
on
the
thought
of
recognition
of
fame
the
one
thing
on
earth
that
still
loomed
before
him
enshrouded
in
vague
misty
splendors
in
a
world
of
illusions
this
was
the
solid
happiness
it
might
yet
be
his
to
grasp
this
last
illusion
was
not
destined
to
be
dissipated
yet
awhile
he
was
sitting
at
the
when
he
received
a
blue
card
inviting
him
to
take
back
his
picture
burning
with
revolt
and
despair
he
had
to
strive
to
appear
calm
what
time
rosina
was
unfolding
a
tale
of
woe
concerning
the
whom
she
had
detected
throwing
away
coals
into
the
that
she
reiterated
monotonously
explained
the
mysteriously
rapid
disappearance
of
the
coals
over
a
ton
since
an
investigation
of
the
had
revealed
a
veritable
it
was
one
of
the
most
curious
characteristics
of
rosina
that
with
all
her
hardness
she
flinched
mentally
before
her
servants
pouring
out
her
grievances
against
them
when
they
were
out
of
so
that
her
husband
suffered
vicariously
for
their
sins
of
omission
or
commission
usually
he
listened
to
her
silently
with
the
courteous
deference
he
would
have
shown
a
guest
never
provoked
to
an
angry
retort
save
by
her
absurd
objections
to
his
models
he
had
abandoned
as
hopeless
the
effort
to
unite
their
souls
but
he
had
no
option
but
to
cap
her
tragic
narrative
by
telling
her
of
his
disappointment
the
news
excited
her
not
to
sympathy
with
his
aspersed
art
but
to
reproachful
alarm
for
his
pecuniary
future
this
was
the
last
straw
he
might
have
stood
out
against
the
academy
exhibiting
elsewhere
and
gradually
building
up
an
outside
reputation
but
the
pecuniary
independence
to
enable
him
to
do
this
which
had
been
the
main
motive
of
his
marriage
was
the
very
thing
that
he
now
saw
he
must
abandon
in
his
secret
paroxysms
of
resentment
more
against
himself
than
against
her
it
became
increasingly
plain
to
him
that
he
could
not
live
on
her
money
that
were
intolerable
to
his
reawakened
manhood
he
must
make
a
financial
success
on
his
own
account
he
must
become
independent
of
her
at
any
cost
to
art
his
entire
preconception
of
his
future
had
broken
down
his
marriage
a
failure
from
the
financial
point
of
view
as
from
every
other
instead
of
having
emancipated
himself
from
the
necessity
of
a
monetary
success
he
had
made
life
impossible
without
it
well
he
would
compromise
he
would
recoil
to
leap
the
better
he
would
do
what
the
public
wanted
and
then
having
secured
its
attention
he
would
do
what
wanted
he
went
to
the
academy
and
to
the
grosvenor
gallery
he
studied
the
most
popular
pictures
of
his
day
and
in
a
couple
of
large
canvases
one
domestic
the
other
biblical
set
himself
to
outdo
them
in
anecdotage
and
obviousness
of
technique
in
a
passion
of
irony
he
half
parodied
his
own
picture
of
in
an
idyllic
interior
called
representing
a
mother
holding
up
a
little
girl
who
in
her
turn
nursed
a
doll
rosina
sat
for
this
to
save
expense
her
own
little
girl
being
now
weaned
the
other
picture
was
a
and
for
the
repudiated
queen
did
rosina
pose
likewise
and
with
unwonted
interest
in
her
work
both
pictures
were
cleverly
painted
for
matthew
strang
strove
to
atone
for
his
lack
of
interest
in
his
subjects
by
painful
impeccability
of
technique
and
to
joy
both
won
acceptance
from
the
hanging
committee
though
at
the
eleventh
hour
on
the
saturday
night
before
varnishing
day
husband
and
wife
were
alike
disappointed
to
receive
an
intimation
that
through
lack
of
space
only
the
smaller
could
be
hung
despite
all
his
contempt
for
his
picture
and
for
the
academy
it
was
a
tingling
sensation
to
move
amid
the
crowd
of
artists
on
varnishing
day
and
to
see
some
whose
serious
faces
he
remembered
noting
on
the
platform
on
that
memorable
medal
pause
before
his
picture
in
admiration
of
the
vigorous
this
was
a
sign
of
success
he
was
destined
to
experience
in
far
greater
measure
the
following
year
but
the
keenness
of
the
thrill
could
never
be
matched
again
and
when
was
mentioned
in
the
papers
and
in
the
early
days
of
the
exhibition
he
watched
fashionably
clad
ladies
gather
in
front
of
it
to
commend
the
child
and
its
touching
foreshadowing
of
maternity
matthew
strang
found
himself
insensibly
beginning
to
partake
in
the
general
admiration
and
with
that
strain
of
weakness
which
london
had
exposed
in
him
from
the
first
he
was
tickled
by
the
praise
of
these
pretty
women
with
their
rustle
of
silks
and
their
atmosphere
of
scent
and
culture
and
his
american
birth
subtly
lent
added
spice
to
his
sensation
in
the
thought
of
conquering
with
his
rude
genius
these
votaries
of
an
elegant
civilization
he
was
quite
annoyed
when
he
heard
of
that
the
doll
was
hit
off
to
the
life
but
the
other
two
figures
were
wooden
but
it
was
not
till
sold
for
two
hundred
pounds
that
the
process
of
corruption
really
began
to
set
in
the
buyer
a
provincial
in
town
for
his
holiday
wished
to
sit
for
his
portrait
the
painter
did
not
like
to
ask
him
to
the
whitewashed
studio
he
told
rosina
they
must
move
to
a
better
neighborhood
the
economical
rosina
would
not
consent
to
quit
a
quarter
where
rates
and
provisions
were
low
and
where
she
had
by
this
time
acquired
several
cronies
equally
martyred
by
their
so
ultimately
he
took
a
larger
studio
in
a
more
fashionable
district
going
to
his
work
every
day
like
a
clerk
to
his
office
relieved
from
his
overpowering
proximity
and
from
her
personal
vision
of
his
models
coming
and
going
though
her
morbid
suspicion
was
always
ready
to
flare
up
thus
the
estrangement
had
begun
people
sent
him
cards
not
knowing
he
was
married
after
some
embarrassed
refusals
he
weakly
accepted
without
explanation
an
invitation
to
dinner
unable
to
decline
it
gracefully
and
knowing
rosina
unsuited
to
the
company
and
his
reticence
made
subsequent
explanation
more
and
more
difficult
after
a
still
greater
success
in
the
next
academy
with
an
only
less
conventional
picture
he
was
caught
in
a
fashionable
whirl
of
work
and
social
engagements
finding
commission
after
commission
thrust
upon
him
driven
to
hasty
production
of
imposing
compositions
to
preserve
his
place
in
the
rapidly
recurrent
academy
and
other
exhibitions
and
always
postponing
the
time
when
he
would
start
upon
the
real
artistic
work
of
his
life
when
he
should
have
accumulated
enough
money
to
give
him
a
couple
of
years
of
freedom
for
independent
art
for
that
fearless
expression
of
his
own
individuality
which
alone
makes
art
which
alone
adds
aught
to
the
treasure
of
beauty
by
contributing
a
new
individual
vision
of
the
beautiful
and
which
so
far
from
being
demanded
by
the
paying
public
must
be
a
revelation
of
unknown
riches
a
plethora
of
portrait
commissions
was
not
conducive
to
personal
art
people
were
much
more
clamorous
for
the
likeness
than
in
the
days
of
sir
joshua
before
photography
had
been
invented
and
every
best
portraits
were
always
those
unpaid
unchallenged
portraits
of
his
parents
and
friends
unflattered
yet
touched
with
the
higher
beauty
of
truth
and
portraits
stood
in
the
way
of
more
complex
work
though
they
got
one
a
cheap
reputation
as
a
stylist
but
there
was
a
great
run
on
matthew
strang
for
portraits
almost
as
much
as
on
one
of
his
for
marbles
the
public
would
scarcely
have
anything
else
and
the
voice
of
the
public
is
the
voice
of
the
purse
by
fits
and
snatches
he
made
attempts
to
express
himself
but
he
never
had
time
to
find
out
what
was
sometimes
in
a
reversion
to
one
of
his
earlier
manners
he
thought
he
wanted
to
express
sensation
to
transfer
to
the
spectator
of
his
landscape
the
sensation
the
original
had
given
him
and
from
his
country
visits
he
would
come
back
with
studies
of
strange
blue
moonlight
effects
on
cliffs
or
weird
dark
seas
destined
never
to
be
worked
up
he
began
a
realistic
picture
of
a
winter
view
from
primrose
hill
with
brownish
trees
in
the
foreground
and
gray
in
the
background
and
a
white
misty
townlet
to
the
left
but
fluctuating
again
he
abandoned
it
for
an
attempt
to
do
the
lyric
of
the
brush
to
express
as
in
balanced
metres
harmonies
of
tree
and
sky
and
water
and
this
again
was
thrown
aside
for
the
picture
of
womanhood
which
under
the
influence
of
a
beautiful
rebuke
he
had
felt
was
the
real
it
behooved
him
to
express
but
the
beautiful
passage
across
his
horizon
had
been
momentary
and
so
even
this
piece
of
imaginative
art
had
been
finished
hurriedly
under
the
pressure
of
other
work
and
thus
the
years
flew
by
like
months
with
incredible
velocity
he
could
not
escape
from
the
of
engagements
he
had
helped
to
weave
nor
did
he
always
desire
to
there
was
a
circumlapping
consolation
about
the
applause
of
the
public
though
it
did
not
warm
him
he
found
a
bitter
satisfaction
as
of
revenge
in
the
smiles
of
society
dames
though
he
did
not
court
them
he
took
no
pleasure
in
the
personal
paragraphs
and
the
notices
of
his
work
though
he
knew
they
were
necessary
to
his
prices
and
though
he
had
no
more
liking
for
the
severe
estimates
of
the
few
who
would
have
none
of
him
the
breach
with
his
wife
widened
imperceptibly
half
involuntarily
though
he
was
passively
glad
when
she
was
not
with
him
to
complicate
his
life
with
her
bourgeois
ways
with
her
vulgar
outlook
he
was
driven
to
a
more
pretentious
studio
which
had
sometimes
to
be
the
scene
of
responsive
hospitalities
and
which
raised
his
prices
he
fell
into
a
life
late
evening
parties
early
morning
rides
in
the
park
visits
for
pleasure
or
or
decoration
to
country
houses
where
his
early
familiarity
with
rod
and
gun
gave
him
a
valuable
air
of
autochthonic
aristocracy
excursions
to
goodwood
to
henley
sketching
tours
all
tended
to
separate
him
from
his
wife
till
at
last
an
almost
complete
separation
had
grown
up
so
gradually
that
except
for
her
spasms
of
jealousy
rosina
seemed
almost
to
have
become
reconciled
to
it
in
view
of
the
popular
success
the
inflow
of
money
and
the
eternal
economy
of
camden
town
and
instead
of
resenting
his
absence
to
have
come
to
welcoming
his
presence
when
on
rare
gala
occasions
he
took
her
out
the
places
she
loved
were
those
which
no
fashionable
foot
ever
trod
and
as
the
couple
wandered
an
obscure
matrimonial
molecule
among
the
holiday
masses
he
was
not
sorry
that
his
juvenile
idea
of
fame
as
a
blazoning
was
only
one
of
the
many
illusions
of
youth
and
so
none
of
the
scented
chattering
crowd
that
gathered
on
show
sunday
before
his
pictures
or
his
refreshments
had
any
inkling
of
the
more
legitimate
in
the
less
fashionable
quarter
he
absolved
his
occasional
qualms
of
conscience
by
lavishing
his
earnings
on
her
which
she
hoarded
though
he
knew
it
not
partly
from
instinct
partly
from
a
superstitious
dread
of
a
catastrophe
when
his
hand
should
fail
or
her
shares
fall
to
zero
too
late
he
comprehended
the
hardness
in
money
matters
that
had
been
at
the
root
of
her
resentment
against
the
defalcating
frenchman
and
it
was
to
spare
her
feelings
as
well
as
to
preserve
peace
that
he
said
never
a
word
to
her
about
the
great
sums
with
which
he
gladdened
the
household
not
that
rosina
knew
much
of
his
other
affairs
in
truth
she
knew
very
little
of
her
life
nor
by
how
vast
a
sweep
it
circumscribed
her
own
she
knew
he
had
to
be
away
from
her
a
very
great
deal
that
he
had
to
stay
in
the
country
to
paint
great
people
she
was
vaguely
aware
that
the
necessities
of
his
profession
made
a
wide
sociality
profitable
she
had
been
once
or
twice
to
peep
at
his
studio
horrified
by
the
grandeur
and
only
consoled
by
the
demonstration
that
its
cost
was
repaid
in
the
prices
like
the
luxurious
fittings
of
the
shops
in
the
holloway
road
but
her
imagination
lacked
the
materials
to
construct
a
vision
of
the
whirlpool
which
had
sucked
him
away
from
her
her
reading
was
limited
to
a
weekly
newspaper
in
which
his
name
seldom
appeared
and
he
in
his
mental
isolation
from
her
found
scant
for
his
silence
reserve
seemed
more
natural
than
communicativeness
she
could
never
know
the
doings
of
his
soul
his
thoughts
were
not
her
thoughts
he
had
given
up
the
attempt
at
communion
the
effort
to
teach
her
to
know
his
real
self
why
should
he
be
less
reticent
concerning
his
outward
movements
his
superficial
self
he
was
aloof
from
her
spiritually
beside
this
his
material
separation
from
her
was
insignificant
the
children
a
girl
of
seven
and
a
boy
of
nearly
four
were
no
bonds
of
union
the
elder
christened
clara
after
aunt
was
sharp
and
lively
enough
but
given
to
passionate
sulking
the
younger
called
after
his
grandfather
david
was
a
lymphatic
colorless
youngster
sickly
and
rather
with
something
of
pathos
in
his
large
gray
eyes
their
father
had
tried
hard
to
love
them
as
he
had
tried
to
love
their
mother
and
had
taken
a
certain
proprietary
interest
in
their
infantile
graces
and
in
the
engaging
ways
of
early
childhood
but
the
claims
of
his
art
left
them
in
the
hands
and
the
older
they
grew
the
less
he
grew
to
feel
them
his
neither
clara
nor
david
had
as
yet
displayed
any
scintilla
of
artistic
instinct
when
he
went
home
he
usually
had
something
for
them
in
his
pocket
as
he
would
have
had
for
the
children
of
an
acquaintance
but
they
gave
him
no
parental
thrill
chapter
ii
the
studio
bell
had
tinkled
so
often
that
afternoon
that
matthew
strang
refused
to
budge
from
the
comfortable
in
which
he
sat
smoking
his
cigarette
and
reading
the
after
the
labors
of
the
day
the
model
had
sipped
her
tea
taken
her
silver
and
was
gone
to
resume
her
place
among
the
clothed
classes
and
the
artist
was
in
no
mood
to
open
his
door
to
the
latest
probably
it
was
only
another
model
to
inquire
if
he
had
any
work
or
to
apprise
him
of
a
change
of
address
or
of
wardrobe
or
else
it
was
a
decayed
artist
who
had
tramped
all
the
way
from
camberwell
ignorant
that
his
old
patron
had
moved
from
the
studio
a
year
ago
or
mayhap
it
was
a
child
he
had
been
much
worried
by
children
lately
since
he
had
picked
up
a
couple
in
the
gutter
and
placed
them
on
the
the
dingy
court
where
the
fortunate
twain
resided
had
been
agitated
from
attic
to
cellar
the
entire
juvenile
population
had
pulled
his
bell
in
quest
of
easy
riches
mothers
had
quarrelled
with
one
another
over
the
chances
of
their
young
ones
the
whole
court
had
been
torn
with
intestine
war
ting
ting
ting
the
person
had
rung
again
more
ferociously
ah
it
must
be
that
interminable
filbert
back
again
well
let
her
ring
on
the
old
jade
rather
an
hour
of
tintinnabulation
than
ten
minutes
of
her
tongue
had
his
man
been
in
he
might
himself
have
been
but
he
could
scarcely
appear
at
the
door
and
deny
himself
her
shrill
falsetto
voice
resurged
in
the
ear
of
memory
offering
nude
photos
from
paris
at
exorbitant
prices
or
lists
of
models
full
of
inaccurate
addresses
or
rare
costumes
most
of
which
could
be
picked
up
at
any
old
shop
he
smiled
recalling
one
of
these
costumes
something
like
a
with
holes
about
an
inch
across
is
greek
and
shows
the
certainly
it
showed
the
figure
he
thought
smiling
more
broadly
and
now
he
remembered
she
had
threatened
to
bring
her
younger
sister
i
have
also
a
little
sister
i
know
if
you
paint
pretty
girls
here
his
memory
inserted
a
giggle
sits
for
modern
dress
or
the
head
not
for
the
figure
of
course
she
mind
a
light
costume
something
diaphanous
though
not
quite
sure
she
has
any
time
left
she
is
always
with
rapper
who
does
those
pastels
for
the
goupil
art
gallery
he
is
so
very
sweet
to
her
she
goes
to
the
theatre
and
dines
with
him
i
sit
myself
sometimes
though
you
think
giggle
of
course
she
sit
in
the
evening
in
case
you
want
her
for
black
and
like
a
woman
he
reflected
cynically
careless
to
take
the
trouble
to
discover
that
i
am
far
too
eminent
for
black
and
know
dressed
carelessly
just
now
i
really
must
be
more
giggle
have
an
empire
gown
to
sit
in
very
sweet
i
will
bring
it
you
to
look
yes
it
was
the
sweet
empire
gown
she
was
bringing
him
if
it
was
not
her
sweeter
sister
his
experienced
eye
foresaw
the
empire
gown
something
cut
by
herself
out
of
muslin
with
an
old
yellow
silk
sash
he
let
the
last
vibration
of
the
die
away
the
creature
would
know
now
he
was
not
in
the
smoke
curled
in
a
cloud
about
his
head
as
looking
up
from
the
page
of
the
magazine
he
gazed
dreamily
at
his
picture
standing
on
the
easel
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
great
luxurious
room
where
the
westering
sun
of
june
sent
down
a
flood
of
light
that
brightened
the
gleam
of
the
gold
frames
of
hanging
pictures
touched
up
rough
sketches
and
preliminary
studies
standing
about
and
lay
in
a
splash
of
brilliancy
among
the
sheets
of
music
and
the
dainty
volumes
of
poetry
and
on
the
grand
piano
suddenly
as
his
gaze
rested
with
a
suspicion
of
wistfulness
on
this
doubly
artistic
interior
in
which
the
pictures
were
only
pleasant
spots
of
color
in
a
larger
harmony
a
harmony
of
rugs
and
flowers
and
tapestry
and
picturesque
properties
and
there
shot
up
in
his
mind
an
image
of
an
ancient
episode
he
saw
himself
a
shy
homely
figure
standing
in
despairing
bitterness
on
the
threshold
of
an
elegant
studio
though
not
so
elegant
nor
so
commodious
as
this
the
studio
of
the
brilliant
cousin
whose
life
had
intersected
his
own
so
many
years
ago
his
face
changed
a
sad
smile
hovered
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
perhaps
some
unhappy
young
man
was
now
outside
his
own
less
hospitable
door
growing
hopeless
as
the
echoes
alone
answered
him
he
started
up
hastily
and
hurrying
into
the
passage
drew
back
the
handle
of
the
door
a
slim
fashionably
attired
gentleman
who
was
just
walking
off
down
the
gravel
pathway
turned
hearing
the
sound
of
the
open
door
his
handsome
bronzed
face
radiating
joyous
amusement
duffer
he
exclaimed
the
famous
painter
turned
pale
his
cigarette
fell
from
his
mouth
so
startled
was
he
that
he
should
have
just
been
thinking
of
herbert
strang
seemed
almost
supernatural
but
the
nervous
feeling
was
submerged
in
a
wave
of
happiness
to
have
herbert
again
was
an
incredible
bliss
how
lucky
he
had
opened
the
door
he
cried
seizing
his
delicately
gloved
hands
with
an
affectionate
impulsiveness
worthy
of
mother
herbert
surveyed
him
roguishly
a
nice
old
pal
to
make
me
ring
three
times
going
on
inside
at
all
laughed
the
painter
in
effusive
happiness
tea
and
cold
but
come
sure
not
disturbing
you
said
herbert
mischievously
all
by
must
be
awfully
convenient
to
have
a
back
door
murmured
herbert
the
painter
shook
his
head
changed
one
bit
he
said
in
laughing
reproach
as
they
moved
within
but
you
have
said
herbert
pausing
in
the
doorway
to
take
him
by
the
shoulders
and
looking
affectionately
into
his
face
quite
a
dash
of
gray
in
your
hair
you
must
have
been
killing
yourself
with
and
indeed
there
were
lines
of
premature
age
on
the
handsome
face
too
though
the
rather
tall
sturdy
figure
was
still
alert
and
unbent
the
dark
eyes
had
lost
something
of
their
old
softness
the
light
of
dream
was
rarer
in
them
but
the
little
tangle
of
locks
on
his
forehead
still
with
the
dark
brown
mustache
and
the
smoothness
of
the
firm
chin
to
suggest
the
artist
behind
the
practical
man
of
the
world
forget
getting
old
he
replied
only
half
jocosely
nonsense
why
several
years
older
than
are
you
course
i
am
you
remember
i
was
your
senior
instructing
you
in
the
ways
of
this
wicked
world
still
looking
a
boy
anyhow
said
strang
what
i
want
to
look
said
herbert
laughing
makes
pretty
women
pet
you
and
hold
your
hand
why
in
italy
i
was
the
envy
of
all
the
cavaliers
this
is
a
change
he
exclaimed
as
he
entered
the
fashionable
studio
you
remember
the
time
you
came
to
me
and
wanted
to
borrow
tenpence
or
something
ha
ha
ha
not
that
surprised
old
boy
not
a
bit
heard
your
name
come
up
quite
half
a
dozen
times
in
the
few
days
been
back
in
stony
old
london
no
thanks
sit
on
the
couch
cooler
there
and
i
have
any
cold
tea
in
this
frightfully
hot
weather
still
faithful
to
if
got
said
strang
cigar
before
dinner
thanks
i
mind
a
cigarette
but
not
interrupting
your
work
be
ridiculous
old
fellow
the
idea
of
my
turning
you
away
considering
you
nearly
did
it
but
a
celebrity
now
your
but
struck
work
for
with
all
this
light
left
this
is
indeed
a
change
from
the
tenpenny
i
suppose
one
gets
tired
the
painter
sighed
you
like
turkish
or
egyptians
cigarettes
turkish
in
women
egyptians
he
answered
laconically
what
a
joke
to
find
you
tired
of
painting
beginning
to
feel
like
i
felt
eh
that
one
demnition
grind
and
tired
of
travelling
and
mind
doing
a
little
painting
now
ha
ha
ha
how
funnily
things
do
turn
out
to
be
sure
why
changed
inside
almost
as
much
as
outside
he
said
looking
up
languidly
into
his
face
as
he
selected
a
cigarette
from
the
box
wonder
if
i
should
have
recognized
you
if
i
had
met
you
in
the
streets
instead
of
tracking
the
lion
to
his
own
den
i
have
thought
half
a
dozen
years
would
have
made
such
a
a
dozen
years
nearer
ten
since
we
ten
is
it
possible
let
me
see
it
must
be
quite
seven
years
since
the
governor
died
poor
old
chap
we
met
since
then
have
we
said
the
painter
of
course
been
careering
about
the
world
ever
since
you
know
he
died
in
egypt
i
know
that
said
strang
only
heard
of
his
death
from
the
dealer
who
took
over
the
he
had
to
go
there
pretty
sharp
for
his
lungs
and
i
was
compelled
to
leave
paris
in
my
second
year
to
go
with
him
and
the
mater
but
he
died
happy
that
blessed
gold
medal
of
mine
made
him
sure
the
name
of
strang
would
be
immortal
in
the
history
of
art
i
always
said
there
was
a
certain
pathos
about
the
poor
old
gentleman
but
perhaps
his
assurance
so
wrong
after
all
because
are
going
to
make
the
name
glorious
you
you
lucky
beggar
and
his
own
name
too
which
ought
to
make
him
happy
even
in
the
great
man
smiled
sadly
but
he
only
said
your
mother
how
is
she
often
wished
to
see
her
living
now
at
lyons
with
some
distant
relatives
of
hers
of
course
she
soon
tired
of
gadding
about
with
me
she
sent
me
a
cutting
about
you
once
from
a
french
paper
so
you
see
how
your
fame
has
spread
often
been
meaning
to
write
to
you
but
you
know
how
it
is
always
moving
about
and
i
always
intended
to
look
you
up
when
i
came
to
london
i
was
here
two
years
ago
on
a
flying
visit
but
some
paper
said
you
were
in
rome
yes
and
i
saw
a
colored
reproduction
of
a
picture
of
yours
decorating
a
cabin
in
the
rockies
the
christmas
supplement
of
the
london
if
i
remember
aright
it
was
a
mother
nursing
a
little
girl
while
the
kid
herself
nursed
a
the
painter
turned
away
and
struck
a
match
then
there
were
a
couple
of
years
before
your
father
died
he
said
last
time
we
met
was
at
the
club
in
seven
dials
on
gold
medal
by
jove
right
said
herbert
thoughtfully
i
wish
to
avoid
a
platitude
i
should
say
that
time
flies
been
a
jolly
good
time
though
for
me
with
nothing
to
do
except
spend
the
poor
old
savings
and
a
jolly
big
hole
knocked
in
them
too
and
come
out
of
it
so
badly
eh
a
stunning
thing
of
yours
in
the
academy
you
glad
i
made
you
promise
to
send
a
picture
to
it
in
those
tenpenny
times
just
come
from
there
got
your
address
from
the
catalogue
i
congratulate
you
heartily
not
the
sort
of
thing
i
expected
from
you
but
well
put
in
and
i
suppose
it
pays
it
is
astonishing
he
went
on
after
pausing
to
sip
from
his
glass
paltry
english
art
looks
to
me
after
all
these
years
and
seeing
everything
everywhere
the
picture
of
the
year
is
exactly
like
the
lid
of
a
box
there
half
a
dozen
things
in
show
that
care
to
look
at
again
in
the
running
look
so
glum
ha
ha
ha
frankly
old
man
your
of
is
jolly
good
work
you
know
i
never
cared
much
for
subject
but
the
modelling
is
a
and
that
sunlight
effect
is
ripping
and
what
a
crowd
there
was
before
it
phew
i
nearly
got
suffocated
trying
to
see
it
and
i
had
to
retire
to
the
architectural
room
to
cool
i
like
picture
one
bit
though
he
an
mean
he
is
said
matthew
strang
with
melancholy
facetiousness
nothing
of
the
kind
that
rather
prejudices
me
in
his
favor
you
forget
i
prophesied
it
you
mean
to
say
you
admire
his
in
lady
on
greens
i
marked
it
in
my
catalogue
do
laugh
you
look
as
dull
and
faded
as
an
old
master
i
think
i
shall
have
to
restore
you
here
have
some
whiskey
yourself
damned
rarely
drink
the
host
said
feebly
used
to
drink
my
whiskey
herbert
reminded
him
and
as
he
poured
himself
out
a
little
in
deference
to
his
brilliant
cousin
he
thought
how
queerly
things
had
inverted
themselves
triumph
of
bacchus
said
herbert
laughing
put
in
the
good
spirit
exorcise
the
bad
as
david
did
to
and
crossing
over
to
the
piano
he
played
a
lively
air
picked
up
that
from
a
spanish
gypsy
he
said
george
but
sinking
to
puns
the
english
climate
got
no
wit
here
and
there
even
a
word
for
examine
your
pictures
ha
hum
i
see
got
quite
a
number
on
your
hands
i
suppose
they
must
be
the
good
ones
ah
what
do
you
call
that
thing
the
lady
in
blue
and
the
harp
womanhood
answered
the
painter
adding
hastily
just
been
returned
from
australia
i
lent
it
to
an
international
exhibition
they
beguiled
me
with
the
prospect
it
would
be
bought
by
the
moonshine
i
should
call
it
laughed
herbert
never
was
such
moonlight
on
sea
or
land
and
does
the
ideal
woman
play
the
harp
on
snowy
at
midnight
without
a
chaperon
supposed
to
be
symbolic
you
know
of
her
inspiring
man
to
nobler
heights
explained
the
artist
with
an
embarrassed
air
he
wondered
vaguely
what
had
become
of
that
beautiful
woman
what
was
her
name
whose
casual
words
at
a
had
driven
him
back
for
a
time
into
what
he
thought
was
the
true
path
of
his
art
me
quite
a
mystic
feeling
about
it
that
the
right
phrase
do
you
know
seriously
thinking
of
becoming
an
art
critic
yes
really
as
i
told
you
had
my
fill
of
travelling
and
now
going
to
try
and
settle
down
here
and
i
rather
like
getting
a
reputation
for
something
or
other
it
makes
real
woman
more
interested
in
one
the
only
thing
afraid
of
is
i
know
too
much
about
the
subject
and
have
actually
handled
the
brush
going
to
paint
too
but
neglected
to
keep
my
hand
in
so
not
much
hopes
of
that
unless
i
came
out
as
a
stylist
who
sees
the
world
as
he
fails
to
paint
it
got
several
new
men
like
that
i
hear
money
in
myopia
and
diseases
of
the
eye
generally
and
how
photography
has
come
along
since
i
was
one
of
the
pioneers
of
its
use
in
art
matthew
strang
shrugged
his
shoulders
does
it
matter
he
said
wearily
whole
a
i
say
must
i
play
another
gypsy
dance
i
came
here
expecting
to
find
you
a
harmony
in
gold
and
lo
a
discord
in
the
blues
the
matter
with
you
jealous
of
cornpepper
how
is
it
they
made
you
an
yet
you
go
out
enough
the
lips
essayed
a
melancholy
smile
go
out
all
i
want
are
enough
cards
stuck
over
your
i
have
to
go
out
a
good
deal
in
the
season
it
pay
to
offend
ideal
womanhood
i
reckon
be
making
a
fine
marriage
one
of
these
days
when
an
as
you
must
be
lady
bettina
modish
or
something
of
that
sort
eh
you
have
another
cigarette
said
the
painter
jerkily
oh
ha
ha
ha
become
of
that
woman
you
rogue
woman
womanhood
the
woman
you
were
living
with
in
paris
ha
ha
ha
you
think
i
knew
that
but
i
met
cornpepper
there
on
my
return
from
egypt
and
he
told
me
seen
you
going
about
with
her
how
we
laughed
over
our
methodist
parson
who
wanted
art
to
be
moral
the
matter
the
face
had
grown
white
and
agitated
sorry
if
said
anything
to
annoy
you
herbert
protested
i
to
have
given
cornpepper
away
but
the
affair
is
so
ancient
i
know
mind
a
reference
to
it
woman
i
was
living
with
in
paris
said
matthew
strang
hoarsely
my
sense
said
herbert
in
low
incredulity
but
his
face
was
only
too
convincing
not
alive
now
he
asked
the
painter
nodded
his
head
hopelessly
herbert
sprang
to
his
feet
god
he
said
mean
to
say
you
were
such
an
ass
as
to
marry
no
wonder
in
the
matthew
strang
was
silent
there
was
a
painful
pause
kept
it
pretty
dark
herbert
said
at
last
seems
to
look
upon
you
as
a
know
replied
the
painter
always
lived
a
lonely
life
and
i
speak
about
my
sorry
i
touched
upon
them
i
can
talk
with
old
and
herbert
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
sympathetically
not
living
with
her
anyhow
and
but
i
living
with
her
at
least
i
go
home
sometimes
not
quite
my
fault
grown
up
gradually
she
lives
in
camden
no
billy
my
young
brother
to
keep
her
company
and
then
the
kids
as
well
herbert
looked
glum
suppose
an
impossible
person
he
said
you
mean
to
live
with
to
be
seen
never
been
out
together
in
london
replied
the
painter
simply
drifted
apart
before
i
was
asked
out
oh
but
no
use
going
into
it
all
too
chap
said
herbert
you
may
rely
on
my
respecting
your
confidence
i
suppose
it
a
secret
seems
to
be
i
make
none
of
it
except
negatively
you
will
find
strang
in
the
directory
as
a
householder
in
camden
town
she
took
the
house
as
it
happened
she
has
a
little
money
of
her
herbert
smiled
sadly
what
i
always
say
the
safest
secret
in
the
world
is
the
open
secret
if
you
had
hidden
her
away
in
patagonia
or
tried
to
put
her
into
a
lunatic
asylum
it
would
have
been
the
talk
of
the
town
as
you
simply
let
her
live
quietly
in
the
heart
of
london
provoked
into
inquisitiveness
and
if
anybody
knows
as
no
doubt
an
odd
person
does
here
and
there
he
tell
anybody
else
because
he
know
a
secret
i
be
surprised
to
hear
the
marriage
was
duly
advertised
in
the
first
column
of
the
matthew
smile
faintly
reflected
his
we
were
married
in
nova
scotia
he
replied
what
are
you
doing
improbable
life
is
mused
herbert
yesterday
i
heard
that
jackson
the
cabinet
minister
has
been
secretly
married
these
last
twenty
years
what
am
i
doing
oh
nothing
particular
i
thought
of
dropping
into
a
i
stand
the
english
theatre
so
why
not
dine
with
me
at
the
you
got
any
other
engagement
and
herbert
peered
curiously
at
the
large
engagement
slate
hung
on
the
wall
i
said
i
would
dine
at
lady
but
i
can
easily
send
a
wire
as
it
a
formal
and
as
rather
a
privileged
person
with
her
i
dare
say
forgive
awfully
naughty
of
you
said
herbert
then
there
a
genius
and
it
be
jolly
to
dine
together
as
in
the
days
of
auld
lang
syne
got
an
awful
lot
to
yarn
about
and
so
have
you
rush
to
my
rooms
and
why
bother
to
dress
though
must
if
you
mind
got
to
go
on
to
one
or
two
places
if
you
mind
waiting
a
few
minutes
while
i
wash
my
brushes
and
put
on
my
we
can
go
at
once
unless
too
fashionable
to
dine
but
i
think
rather
dress
cooler
in
this
frightful
weather
shall
i
come
back
or
meet
you
at
the
club
you
you
go
on
to
the
club
and
be
there
just
as
quick
as
i
can
oh
write
out
that
wire
and
send
it
for
perhaps
you
had
better
though
i
expect
my
man
back
in
a
few
minutes
seeing
about
the
delivery
of
a
picture
to
the
london
agents
of
the
liverpool
autumn
when
herbert
was
gone
matthew
strang
did
not
at
once
mount
to
his
the
advent
of
this
visitor
from
the
past
had
stirred
up
all
its
muddy
depths
and
the
knowledge
that
he
had
a
little
time
to
spare
kept
him
brooding
over
it
all
recalling
the
episodes
of
their
and
blended
with
them
as
faded
scents
with
old
letters
he
caught
faint
elusive
whiffs
of
that
freshness
of
feeling
and
aspiration
which
had
impregnated
them
in
those
dear
divine
days
of
youth
when
even
his
darkest
hours
were
tinged
with
a
of
dawn
never
again
would
he
feel
that
glow
that
fervor
those
strange
stirrings
of
romance
that
delicious
sadness
sweeter
than
all
mirth
when
a
perfect
blue
day
could
bring
tears
to
the
eyes
and
the
melancholy
patter
of
rain
at
twilight
was
like
a
dying
fall
of
music
and
something
strange
and
far
away
subtly
interfused
itself
with
the
loveliness
of
nature
with
flowers
and
sunsets
and
summer
nights
a
haunting
grace
intangible
inexpressible
hinting
somehow
of
divine
archetypes
of
beauty
in
some
celestial
universe
no
even
his
spasmodic
strivings
to
escape
from
the
rut
of
false
art
were
becoming
fewer
and
farther
between
perhaps
he
was
not
a
genius
after
all
he
had
begun
to
think
why
should
he
vex
himself
that
sentiment
of
constable
at
which
he
had
winced
when
he
first
came
across
it
may
say
what
they
like
of
my
art
what
i
know
is
that
it
is
art
was
losing
its
power
to
sting
the
stirrings
of
his
astral
self
were
subsiding
he
felt
himself
hardening
steadily
into
a
mere
unit
of
the
club
world
of
tired
and
successful
men
who
having
blunted
their
emotions
by
heavy
feeding
of
all
their
appetites
could
no
longer
feel
the
primal
things
taking
even
their
vices
with
the
joyless
sobriety
of
virtue
and
though
he
himself
was
temperate
enough
and
had
not
been
unfaithful
to
rosina
but
only
to
the
spirit
of
the
marriage
contract
yet
this
same
drought
of
feeling
this
furred
tongue
of
the
emotional
being
was
becoming
unpleasantly
familiar
as
he
sat
now
moodily
reviewing
the
situation
he
burst
into
a
spasmodic
bitter
laugh
it
had
struck
him
for
the
first
time
that
his
life
had
come
to
be
not
unlike
his
a
life
apart
from
his
with
a
rare
stay
under
the
domestic
roof
the
wife
the
more
amiable
for
his
absences
a
sudden
intuition
seemed
a
on
his
past
he
felt
drawn
to
the
dead
sailor
with
a
new
sympathy
he
rose
in
agitation
extending
his
arms
towards
a
visionary
form
father
he
cried
aloud
you
suffer
like
me
you
call
sir
and
claydon
his
who
had
come
in
quietly
through
the
back
door
descended
from
the
bedroom
where
he
had
been
laying
out
his
things
said
his
master
my
ready
going
out
a
little
earlier
than
and
the
painter
recalled
to
reality
hastened
to
perform
his
toilet
but
his
mind
still
ran
in
the
grooves
of
the
past
remote
from
all
the
new
interests
and
distractions
of
a
brilliant
career
when
he
sprang
from
the
hansom
and
walked
through
the
door
of
the
club
he
remembered
that
this
was
the
very
club
he
had
come
to
on
his
first
day
in
london
nay
that
the
deferential
was
the
very
man
whose
majesty
had
chilled
him
he
wondered
now
whether
the
old
fellow
ever
connected
the
popular
painter
with
the
homely
diffident
youth
who
had
inquired
for
matthew
strang
waiting
for
you
curious
now
it
was
herbert
that
was
waiting
for
matthew
strang
but
the
thought
of
the
whirligig
of
time
gave
him
no
pleasure
in
his
early
struggles
in
london
when
no
one
would
buy
his
work
he
had
gloated
in
anticipation
over
the
humility
of
the
dealers
when
he
should
have
made
his
position
now
he
had
long
since
forgotten
and
forgiven
their
contempt
how
could
they
know
he
was
worth
taking
up
there
was
nothing
but
the
palest
shadow
of
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
they
would
scour
london
in
search
of
those
despised
pictures
if
they
only
knew
he
wondered
sometimes
if
those
early
things
of
his
would
ever
come
up
into
the
light
whether
the
daughter
of
his
ancient
landlady
still
treasured
her
and
what
had
become
of
paradise
of
the
a
bluff
graybeard
in
the
hall
shook
his
hand
heartily
it
was
matthew
strang
knew
now
that
whom
he
had
imagined
to
pass
his
days
encamped
before
the
beatific
vision
was
a
jolly
good
fellow
with
sheaves
of
amusing
anecdotes
but
he
remembered
the
first
time
had
spoken
to
him
at
a
city
banquet
in
the
beginnings
of
his
fame
oldsters
will
have
to
be
looking
to
our
laurels
he
had
said
placing
his
hand
on
the
young
shoulder
after
the
banquet
had
given
him
a
lift
in
his
open
carriage
and
as
they
rolled
through
the
busy
flashing
london
night
a
voice
in
breast
kept
crying
out
is
look
this
is
the
great
i
am
driving
with
why
you
look
you
stupid
multitudes
do
you
not
know
this
is
himself
oh
why
did
not
some
of
the
people
who
knew
matthew
strang
come
along
and
see
him
driving
with
perhaps
they
did
there
must
surely
be
one
acquaintance
at
least
among
all
those
crowds
and
he
would
tell
the
others
he
had
scarcely
been
able
to
reply
rationally
to
conversation
so
intoxicated
was
he
by
the
great
proximity
and
now
he
himself
was
a
popular
celebrity
shown
with
the
finger
on
the
eve
of
academic
honors
had
he
not
of
all
the
younger
men
among
the
guests
been
called
upon
with
disconcerting
unexpectedness
to
respond
to
a
toast
at
the
academy
greenwich
dinner
only
last
month
was
he
not
already
on
the
council
of
minor
artistic
societies
yes
doubtless
he
himself
was
already
the
cause
of
like
foolish
flutterings
in
the
breasts
of
youthful
he
whose
heart
could
no
longer
flutter
not
even
when
the
youthful
was
a
woman
and
beautiful
he
dined
with
herbert
at
a
little
table
his
burst
of
communicativeness
had
exhausted
itself
and
he
was
glad
to
let
the
returned
traveller
do
the
bulk
of
the
talking
as
well
as
of
the
dining
he
himself
ate
little
though
the
cuisine
was
excellent
and
the
cellar
took
high
rank
over
dinner
herbert
bubbled
over
in
endless
reminiscences
of
the
rare
dishes
and
vintages
he
had
consumed
the
operas
and
symphonies
he
had
heard
the
women
who
had
loved
him
a
veritable
rhapsody
of
wine
woman
and
song
in
an
access
of
unmalicious
bitterness
like
that
which
had
overcome
him
on
the
threshold
of
studio
matthew
strang
felt
that
herbert
was
the
real
master
the
master
of
life
in
the
other
men
gathered
round
there
was
grose
whose
colossal
canvases
were
exhibited
at
a
shilling
a
head
with
explanatory
pamphlets
by
high
ecclesiastical
authorities
and
there
was
thornbury
who
succeeded
him
in
the
same
gallery
with
colossal
nudes
that
needed
no
explanation
from
ecclesiastical
authorities
matthew
introduced
herbert
to
trapp
the
realistic
novelist
and
herbert
introduced
matthew
to
sir
frederick
boyd
the
composer
who
related
with
gusto
a
story
of
how
he
had
exposed
a
cheat
at
monte
carlo
a
scotch
asked
matthew
to
recommend
him
a
model
two
associates
joined
the
group
one
was
a
vigorous
painter
who
painted
everything
premier
the
other
was
cornpepper
externally
unchanged
save
for
a
round
beard
he
had
long
since
cut
himself
adrift
from
the
azure
art
club
though
he
still
counted
his
disciples
whose
experimental
fumblings
in
development
of
his
methods
he
boasted
of
observing
in
sapient
passivity
it
on
the
dog
he
used
to
chuckle
to
his
familiars
done
searching
let
my
imitators
search
and
risk
the
bogs

the
if
they
do
strike
a
path
on
the
spot
instantly
to
lead
them
along
it
the
only
way
one
can
learn
from
he
used
to
tell
with
glee
how
one
of
them
had
ruined
a
picture
by
putting
it
out
in
the
rain
to
mellow
it
of
those
modern

dined
with
herbert
at
a
little
stylists
who
are
trying
to
discount
old
mastership
will
survive
their
pictures
was
commentary
on
a
phase
of
the
newer
art
will
leave
masterpieces
of
a
good
many
changes
had
taken
place
in
the
art
world
since
matthew
strang
had
first
had
the
felicity
of
drinking
whiskey
in
studio
the
flowing
tide
was
now
with
the
decorative
artists
of
whom
the
of
that
evening
had
proved
a
pioneer
the
fishtown
school
of
photographic
realism
had
lived
long
enough
to
be
orthodox
the
azure
art
club
itself
was
half
absorbed
by
the
academy
and
a
new
formula
of
revolt
was
momently
expected
on
the
horizon
some
said
it
was
to
be
primitive
others
mysteriously
whispered
herbert
with
mock
seriousness
announced
that
he
himself
was
about
to
lead
a
movement
the
originality
of
which
consisted
in
seeing
nature
through
stained
glass
what
weird
magic
a
landscape
gained
when
observed
through
a
green
or
pink
window
but
he
found
the
men
not
so
willing
to
talk
of
principles
as
in
the
days
of
bohemian
parties
when
carrie
with
the
whiskey
bottle
stood
for
the
sober
club
attendant
with
his
tray
of
liqueur
brandies
the
conversation
was
rigidly
concrete
except
for
a
moment
when
cornpepper
nearly
came
to
hot
words
with
the
photographic
painter
who
insisted
that
nature
was
always
beautiful
the
little
man
glaring
through
his
monocle
and
rasping
the
plush
with
his
nails
insisted
that
this
was
sheer
cant
one
had
only
to
look
in
the
glass
to
see
how
ugly
nature
could
sometimes
be
selection
was
the
only
excuse
for
art
random
transcripts
from
nature
were
as
foolish
as
the
excesses
of
the
school
into
which
the
azure
art
gallery
had
degenerated
but
this
lapse
of
into
his
early
manner
was
brief
recovering
himself
he
told
a
malicious
anecdote
about
an
artist
who
was
taking
to
etching
because
his
eyesight
was
failing
and
he
explained
the
domesticity
of
british
art
by
the
objection
of
wives
to
all
models
except
babies
everybody
knew
he
said
why
carruthers
had
been
driven
to
landscape
and
christmas
supplements
upon
it
dogmatized
the
little
man
with
his
most
owlish
air
of
wisdom
man
who
marries
his
model
is
lost
she
will
never
tolerate
a
model
on
the
premises
his
told
a
story
of
a
who
had
got
himself
invited
to
the
greenwich
dinner
last
year
and
had
asked
to
give
him
the
sketch
of
passing
barges
which
the
great
man
had
pencilled
on
his
after
dinner
gave
it
to
him
this
year
he
was
there
again
and
said
with
proud
respect
to
still
got
that
and
produced
it
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
but
did
you
hear
asked
trapp
said
being
a
financier
he
doubled
i
said
that
cried
cornpepper
angrily
doubt
said
herbert
a
i
pulled
it
out
of
the
fire
screamed
cornpepper
somebody
exhibited
another
sketch
grotesquely
indecorous
by
a
popular
painter
of
religious
masterpieces
and
the
latest
epigram
on
the
divorce
case
of
the
hour
was
repeated
and
enjoyed
but
matthew
laughter
held
no
merriment
you
be
at
the
academy
he
asked
trapp
to
turn
the
conversation
i
care
for
crowds
replied
the
realistic
novelist
the
conversation
rambled
on
the
composer
drifted
away
and
a
academician
took
his
place
an
elderly
dandified
figure
with
a
languid
drawl
an
aristocratic
manner
caught
from
his
sitters
and
a
contempt
for
continental
art
in
despite
of
which
matthew
strang
protested
mildly
against
the
bad
hanging
at
burlington
house
of
a
portrait
by
an
eminent
frenchman
cornpepper
talked
of
a
sale
at
at
which
most
of
the
pictures
had
fetched
lower
prices
than
was
given
for
them
by
their
last
owners
all
a
said
herbert
no
such
thing
as
a
fixed
value
in
a
work
of
art
everything
depends
on
the
pose
the
more
the
buyer
gives
for
a
picture
the
more
he
likes
it
a
game
of
brag
set
up
a
fine
establishment
the
dealer
will
pay
my
old
governor
was
a
good
deal
taken
in
by
pretentious
humbugs
with
pals
in
the
as
the
own
establishment
was
notoriously
finer
than
his
pictures
a
fact
of
which
the
wandering
herbert
was
ignorant
matthew
strang
hastened
to
speak
of
tarmigan
who
had
been
recalled
to
memory
by
the
catalogue
of
the
aforesaid
sale
afraid
gone
under
poor
fellow
he
said
tried
to
come
across
him
but
he
was
always
a
mysterious
but
cornpepper
continued
to
talk
of
the
sale
of
the
fluctuations
of
prices
of
the
impoverished
condition
of
the
market
so
menacing
to
young
artists
who
had
set
up
fashionable
establishments
on
the
strength
of
their
first
sales
of
the
potentialities
of
america
that
yet
undiscovered
continent
till
all
the
tide
of
secret
bitterness
welled
up
in
a
flood
from
the
depths
of
matthew
soul
money
money
money
he
had
never
really
escaped
from
it
what
a
mirage
art
was
even
success
only
brought
the
same
preoccupations
with
prices
it
was
all
the
old
sordidness
over
again
on
a
higher
plane
the
ring
of
the
gold
was
the
eternal
undertone
bringing
discord
into
every
harmony
with
a
public
ignorant
of
what
art
meant
conceiving
it
as
something
rigid
like
science
not
as
the
expression
of
the
temperament
technique
and
vision
of
individual
genius
with
a
public
craving
for
pictorial
platitudes
art
could
not
be
and
was
not
produced
save
by
a
martyr
here
and
there
everywhere
the
counting
of
pieces
and
the
shuffling
of
the
complacent
academician
irritated
him
he
was
tired
of
reading
of
his
marble
halls
the
vassals
and
serfs
at
his
side
his
garden
parties
his
belgravian
palace
erected
on
the
ruins
of
a
forgotten
bankruptcy
the
fumes
of
expensive
wines
and
cigars
gave
him
a
momentary
vertigo
sake
stop
talking
shop
he
burst
out
suddenly
the
astonished
cornpepper
let
his
fall
you
gone
crazy
strang
he
asked
witheringly
do
you
join
an
club
for
if
you
want
to
talk

strikes
me
better
get
yourself
put
up
for
the
commercial
what
we
are
retorted
matthew
strang
the
scotch
pacified
them
by
proposing
a
game
of
and
herbert
eagerly
seconding
the
proposal
it
was
carried
and
the
group
mounted
to
the
where
matthew
strang
won
half
a
crown
before
he
went
off
to
his
nocturnal
parties
leaving
his
cousin
still
renewing
with
zest
his
olden
experience
of
the
lighter
side
of
british
art
chapter
iii
as
a
matter
of
habit
matthew
strang
went
some
weeks
later
to
the
academy
soirée
to
add
his
handshake
to
the
many
suffered
by
the
presidential
image
of
patience
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
to
help
appease
the
insatiable
appetite
of
the
crowd
of
christians
to
whom
lions
are
thrown
it
was
part
of
his
success
to
move
through
fluttering
and
it
imbittered
him
to
feel
that
the
average
admirer
conceives
the
artist
as
living
in
a
world
of
beautiful
dreams
sweet
with
the
incense
of
perpetually
swung
censers
and
knows
nothing
of
the
agonies
or
the
sweatings
that
go
to
the
making
of
beautiful
things
sees
always
the
completed
design
and
never
the
workman
scraping
the
paint
or
wetting
the
back
of
the
canvas
or
tossing
sleeplessly
under
the
weight
of
a
ruined
picture
in
the
restless
dissatisfaction
that
had
grown
upon
him
since
the
reappearance
of
herbert
had
undammed
a
flood
of
ancient
memories
this
feeling
possessed
him
more
strongly
than
ever
inspiring
a
morbid
resentment
of
the
chattering
crew
divided
between
and
there
was
almost
a
suspicion
of
a
leonine
snarl
in
the
stereotyped
answer
are
very
kind
to
say
so
which
he
gave
to
the
grimacing
persons
who
buttonholed
him
to
bask
in
the
radiance
of
his
success
or
to
effuse
honest
admiration
everybody
seemed
to
him
and
in
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
so
many
cadaverous
complexions
snag
teeth
noses
scraggy
shoulders
glazed
eyes
with
monocle
or
spectacles
ungainly
figures
squat
or
slim
queer
costumes
bald
heads
or
how
horrible
gentlefolk
were
more
uncouth
even
than
the
denizens
of
the
slums
those
one
could
imagine
to
be
a
very
different
breed
cleaned
and
properly
clothed
but
these
had
had
every
chance
how
poorly
humanity
compared
with
cows
and
horses
what
a
price
man
had
paid
for
soul
and
without
always
getting
it
surely
none
but
eyes
could
gaze
unblinking
unsmiling
at
the
grotesque
show
of
mankind
the
quaint
crania
the
unsightly
bodies
the
crowd
struck
him
as
the
inventions
of
a
comic
draughtsman
in
a
malicious
mood
the
men
in
black
and
white
the
ladies
in
color
and
indeed
though
he
was
not
thinking
of
himself
his
stalwart
figure
and
his
handsome
head
stood
out
notably
from
a
serried
batch
of
degenerate
physiques
you
are
determined
to
cut
me
strang
the
painter
started
violently
as
the
laughing
syllables
sounding
far
more
musical
than
the
faint
strains
of
the
band
in
the
sculpture
room
vibrated
above
the
endless
buzz
of
the
crowd
that
hemmed
him
in
he
looked
up
his
moody
fit
vanished
before
the
radiant
apparition
of
a
beautiful
woman
in
a
shimmering
amber
gown
from
which
her
shoulders
rose
dazzling
a
jewelled
butterfly
fluttered
at
her
breast
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
that
eye
hers
he
recanted
his
contempt
for
the
draughtsmanship
have
bowed
to
you
three
times
she
said
and
the
twinkling
of
her
eye
large
and
gray
and
lambent
was
supplemented
by
the
smile
that
hovered
about
the
corners
of
her
wide
sweet
mouth
you
take
any
notice
of
beg
your
pardon
he
said
in
flushed
embarrassment
must
have
been
lost
in
she
shook
her
head
bewitchingly
remember
me
celebrities
never
do
remember
people
though
people
always
remember
do
remember
you
he
protested
chords
of
memory
vibrating
tremulously
and
melodiously
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
at
a
some
years
you
remember
my
name
think
i
caught
it
then
he
said
simply
i
remember
you
scolded
me
because
my
pictures
were
only
she
laughed
gayly
then
i
ought
to
apologize
to
you
i
have
changed
my
you
think
even
that
from
it
what
i
mean
is
that
i
have
come
to
think
less
of
useful
things
you
know
i
was
a
socialist
then
but
let
me
introduce
my
friend
to
have
to
introduce
yourself
first
nor
said
a
younger
lady
whom
he
then
perceived
at
her
side
he
smiled
are
irrepressible
olive
said
her
friend
strang
let
me
introduce
myself
then
he
bowed
still
smiling
wyndwood
she
added
explain
my
abbreviation
which
always
puzzles
knows
nor
stands
for
eleanor
remonstrated
her
friend
they
suppose
your
name
is
norval
smile
met
the
now
if
my
punctilious
friend
is
satisfied
let
me
introduce
miss
miss
regan
gave
him
her
hand
cordially
are
your
pictures
to
be
found
strang
she
asked
been
to
the
academy
before
and
we
should
so
like
to
save
the
not
worth
looking
at
he
said
uncomfortably
he
suddenly
felt
ashamed
of
them
it
was
thus
that
he
had
felt
more
than
two
years
ago
when
over
her
strawberries
and
cream
wyndwood
had
lectured
him
for
artistic
aloofness
from
the
travail
of
the
time
insisting
that
it
was
the
mission
of
all
forms
of
art
to
express
the
aspiration
of
the
century
towards
a
higher
and
juster
social
life
towards
the
coming
of
kingdom
on
earth
and
that
it
would
be
honester
for
him
to
plough
the
land
than
to
paint
decorative
pictures
for
the
of
capitalists
he
had
scarcely
taken
in
her
point
of
view
more
persuaded
by
her
presence
than
by
her
words
by
some
intangible
radiation
of
earnestness
and
goodness
from
the
lovely
face
and
the
soulful
gray
eyes
and
less
ashamed
of
the
sinfulness
of
his
own
artistic
standpoint
than
of
the
often
meretricious
quality
of
his
performance
she
had
been
the
first
woman
to
speak
slightingly
of
his
rôle
in
the
world
and
her
dispraise
as
it
did
with
his
own
discontent
had
impressed
him
more
than
all
the
praise
just
as
one
unfavorable
newspaper
critique
rankled
while
a
hundred
eulogies
passed
across
consciousness
scarcely
ruffling
its
waves
when
the
flux
of
the
had
drifted
her
off
in
the
wake
of
gerard
brode
the
handsome
young
socialist
he
had
felt
that
he
too
might
have
become
a
socialist
or
a
ploughboy
or
even
an
honest
painter
under
the
inspiration
of
her
enthusiastic
eyes
he
had
thought
of
her
for
several
months
almost
as
a
creature
of
dream
so
swift
and
shadowy
had
been
her
flitting
across
his
horizon
and
she
had
easily
lent
herself
to
that
conception
of
ideal
womanhood
which
the
world
had
not
yet
destroyed
because
the
world
had
not
created
it
it
was
under
the
impulsion
of
the
eloquent
play
of
light
across
her
face
that
he
had
conceived
and
painted
that
allegory
of
inspiration
which
herbert
unable
to
read
in
it
the
pathetic
expression
of
the
dissatisfaction
at
once
with
real
womanhood
and
his
own
work
had
found
so
amusing
and
he
was
startled
now
to
see
how
nearly
he
had
reproduced
her
traits
in
his
conception
of
the
figure
on
the
not
so
much
perhaps
in
the
features
in
which
the
slight
upward
tilt
of
the
nose
was
omitted
and
the
size
of
the
ears
diminished
as
in
the
clustering
chestnut
hair
with
gold
lights
in
it
and
in
the
poise
of
the
head
the
long
thin
botticelli
hands
the
small
feet
and
the
graceful
curves
of
the
rather
tall
form
and
above
all
in
the
expression
that
seemed
to
suffuse
her
face
with
spiritual
effluence
the
first
impression
renewed
itself
in
all
its
depth
he
asked
himself
with
amazement
how
he
could
have
let
the
waves
of
life
wash
it
away
so
completely
that
even
inquiry
about
the
picture
had
not
recalled
her
clearly
to
his
memory
but
i
want
to
see
your
pictures
she
said
a
of
bacchus
i
hear
i
saw
the
fresco
by
caracci
it
in
the
farnese
palace
in
rome
on
our
homeward
journey
been
in
russia
miss
regan
and
i
with
monsieur
and
madame
dolkovitch
to
see
podnieff
in
his
oh
so
charming
so
simple
and
saintly
he
enables
one
to
construct
francis
of
makes
very
bad
butter
said
miss
regan
is
the
greatest
spiritual
force
in
russia
wyndwood
said
sweetly
dolkovitch
is
doing
much
to
extend
his
influence
in
england
i
wish
you
knew
dolkovitch
would
he
make
me
do
better
pictures
he
asked
playfully
struggling
a
little
against
the
obsession
of
her
sweet
seriousness
will
reserve
my
opinion
till
i
have
seen
your
latest
manner
though
i
confess
i
find
the
title
triumph
of
bacchus
a
hopeful
augury
of
noble
work
but
do
tell
me
where
it
is
or
must
i
consult
the
catalogue
miss
regan
made
me
bring
is
in
this
very
rather
a
compliment
the
academicians
generally
reserve
the
big
room
or
at
least
the
line
for
their
own
works
but
it
is
cruel
of
you
to
leave
me
so
subtle
nor
said
miss
regan
course
he
can
not
be
seen
looking
at
his
own
let
us
go
where
the
crowd
is
thinner
he
pleaded
round
your
picture
queried
miss
regan
naïvely
shame
olive
laughed
wyndwood
shall
punish
you
by
not
letting
you
see
it
we
are
at
your
service
strang
show
us
what
you
i
not
get
you
any
refreshment
he
said
as
they
passed
into
the
smaller
room
and
into
a
perceptibly
cooler
atmosphere
thank
you
this
is
refreshing
enough
said
wyndwood
with
a
sigh
of
relief
wyndwood
means
that
she
lives
on
air
said
her
friend
olive
i
eat
quite
as
much
as
used
to
before
you
developed
this
dolkovitch
phase
and
began
understudying
an
matthew
saw
the
opportunity
for
a
commonplace
compliment
but
he
did
not
take
it
the
plane
on
which
wyndwood
existed

every
word
she
said
sounded
magically
musical
and
delightfully
wise
and
witty
remarks
one
merely
smiled
at
though
she
too
had
a
low
voice
excellent
thing
in
woman
and
was
considered
handsome
by
those
she
did
not
annoy
she
reminded
the
painter
of
a
caryatid
as
she
stood
there
rather
more
sturdy
than
her
friend
and
shorter
with
stronger
features
and
a
firmer
chin
but
to
the
full
as
graciously
proportioned
she
had
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
a
warm
coloring
that
reached
its
most
vivid
tint
in
the
intense
red
of
the
lips
her
dress
was
of
a
soft
cut
high
with
yellow
roses
at
the
throat
and
but
for
the
preoccupation
with
her
friend

who
writes
those
dainty
essays
and
who
realizing

the

sympathy
traversed
the

unreproved
nor
you
can
afford
to
be
magnanimous
but
i
contend
that
beautiful
souls
have
no
right
to
get
mixed
up
with
hooked
noses
we
ought
to
judge
a
soul
by
the
body
it
keeps
if
this
country
ever
becomes
a
republic
it
will
be
due
not
to
democracy
but
to
photography
you
will
agree
with
me
i
know
he
started
wondering
what
he
was
called
upon
to
agree
with
is
truth
truth
beauty
he
quoted
vaguely
you
never
put
truly
ugly
persons
into
pictures
miss
regan
persisted
he
admitted
in
not
even
then
the
girl
retorted
far
rather
these
portraits
came
out
of
their
frames
and
walked
about
than
promenade
among
the
originals
as
we
are
doing
i
suppose
one
original

wyndwood
remonstrated
there
queried
olive
in
innocent
accents
thought
there
were
a
lot
judging
by
the
want
of

not
up
to

said
matthew
strang
smilingly
is
the
last

a
goes
for
values
spots
passages
color
schemes
all
sorts
of
things
take
precedence
of
the
likeness
in
their
importance
for
art
the
likeness
is
irrelevant
to
art
it
concerns
only
the

art
concerns
the
world
a
friend
of
mine
who
edits
an
illustrated
paper
which
is
the
first
to
publish
portraits
of
everybody
who
becomes
anybody
contends
that
the
number
of
persons
who
know
any

is
a
negligible
quantity
the
public
demands
he
says
so
you
see
your
criticism
leaves
our
withers
do
produce
your
catalogue
nor
said
miss
regan
flying
off
at
a
tangent
for
want
of
an
answer
am
dying
to
see
the
name
of
that
thing
stuck
right
up
there
on
the
wyndwood
after
protesting
that
nobody
else
was
consulting
a
catalogue
which
only
made
olive
more
eager
fished
out
the
booklet
from
some
obscure
pocket
and
olive
turned
the
pages
impatiently
just
like
miss
regan
to
want
to
look
at
the
skied
pictures
her
friend
murmured
to
the
painter
the
poor
man
cried
miss
regan
this
is
what
the
picture
is
called
love
but
oh
most
dread
desire
of
love
linked
in
gyves
i
saw
them
stand
love
shackled
with
hand
to
hand
and
one
was
eyed
as
the
blue
vault
above
but
hope
tempestuous
like
a
hove
the
gaze
even
as
in
his
whose
wand
vainly
all
night
with
power
has
the
unyielding
caves
of
some
deep
the
poor
man
fancy
the
indignity
of
having
a
long
quotation
skied
lovely
lines
exclaimed
wyndwood
ignoring
the
humorous
aspect
which
appealed
to
her
companion
they
not
express
the
idea
perfectly
strang
am
afraid
i
did
not
quite
catch
their
significance
he
said
flushing
the
confession
was
not
so
candid
as
it
sounded
for
he
had
been
less
intent
on
the
quotation
than
on
studying
the
sweetness
of
her
face
and
watching
the
emotional
heaving
of
the
jewelled
butterfly
on
her
beautiful
bosom
olive
regan
politely
offered
him
the
catalogue
and
his
flush
grew
deeper
as
he
seemed
to
read
his
personal
tragedy
in
the
images
what
ironical
providence
had
sent
him
the
words
just
then
most
dread
desire
of
love
perhaps
it
was
that
which
made
his
life
so
unreal
to
him
which
explained
its
hollowness
he
had
never
loved
in
a
strange
flash
of
imaginative
insight
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
room
was
full
of
lovers
love
was
in
the
air
delicate
rumors
and
whispers
of
divine
delight
of
holy
pain
fluttered
tremulously
on
all
sides
couples
moved
their
beauty
spiritualized
their
very
ugliness
transfigured
love
redeemed
the
creation
he
remembered
that
in
the
days
when
he
had
trodden
the
lonely
london
pavements
hungry
and
jostled
by
hurrying
crowds
he
had
yet
seemed
to
himself
the
only
solid
figure
amid
a
throng
of
shadows
flitting
to
death
and
oblivion
in
this
tense
instant
he
felt
it
was
he
that
had
always
been
the
shadow
the
one
shadow
amid
a
world
of
substantialities
and
solidities
a
world
that
lived
while
he
was
recording
the
forms
and
colors
of
life
and
even
if
he
should
ever
love
and
the
thought
set
his
heart
fluttering
as
he
had
imagined
it
could
never
flutter
again
even
if
love
should
ever
make
existence
real
for
him
was
he
not
predestined
to
a
doom
more
terrible
even
than
the
apathy
of
loveless
life
in
gyves
i
saw
them
stand
love
shackled
with
hand
to
wyndwood
she
too
was
married
and
in
that
thought
he
knew
that
love
had
begun
for
him
the
unrest
into
which
the
first
vision
of
her
had
plunged
him
and
which
time
had
stilled
had
at
last
come
to
understand
itself
he
loved
and
his
love
was
vain
they
had
come
to
him
both
at
once
shackled
with
hand
to
he
returned
the
catalogue
mechanically
to
miss
regan
fine
are
they
not
said
wyndwood
the
question
dragged
him
up
from
abysses
of
dream
but
even
though
he
felt
he
must
be
answering
it
he
lingered
in
luxurious
agony
over
the
music
of
the
question
its
vibrations
prolonging
themselves
in
his
ear
are
indeed
exquisite
he
said
slowly
at
last
do
you
think
there
would
be
any
is
always
hope
said
wyndwood
gently
there
seemed
a
sweet
assurance
in
the
unconscious
words
he
heard
a
chime
of
golden
bells
floating
up
from
some
city
perhaps
it
was
only
from
the
band
in
the
sculpture
room
but
he
felt
he
must
not
attach
himself
further
to
the
fascinating
twain
his
solicitude
would
be
too
marked
and
he
was
aware
of
many
eyes
drawn
by
their
beauty
but
before
he
could
speak
wyndwood
went
on
musingly
after
all
hope
is
better
than
fulfilment
there
are
blue
hills
on
the
horizon
which
the
child
longs
to
go
beyond
but
happiness
always
lies
on
the
hither
side
with
the
blue
hills
still
her
eyes
filled
with
dreamy
light
is
as
george
herbert
so
beautifully
says
glozing
pleasures
casks
of
happiness
foolish
and
wishes
chases
in
arras
gilded
emptiness
shadows
dreams
in
a
career
lies
nothing
between
two
dishes
these
are
the
pleasures
how
exquisitely
she
spoke
the
melancholy
lines
that
seemed
fraught
with
all
the
pathos
of
the
human
destiny
her
words
rippling
through
the
buzz
of
platitudinarian
trivialities
he
heard
vaguely
all
around
him
like
a
silver
stream
through
an
unlovely
country
she
had
suffered
too
she
too
had
found
life
and
its
pleasures
hollow
he
saw
that
in
the
quiver
of
the
beautiful
lip
in
the
wistful
brightness
of
the
eye
straightway
his
heart
was
full
of
tears
for
her
he
longed
to
comfort
her
to
sacrifice
himself
for
her
why
could
she
not
be
happy
he
had
a
sense
of
jar
when
miss
regan
said
rather
a
strange
quotation
for
you
and
he
had
a
true
notion
of
our
futility
that
gentle
old
am
in
no
fighting
mood
olive
replied
wyndwood
gently
stand
up
for
your
sex
the
painter
asked
miss
regan
in
surprise
she
had
that
resourceful
air
which
he
associated
with
pioneers
of
female
movements
olive
shrugged
her
shapely
shoulders
forbid
that
i
should
be
the
the
tossing
of
the
crowd
threw
up
a
man
with
a
handsome
leonine
cast
of
features
who
greeted
the
two
ladies
with
an
air
of
voilà
he
cried
joyously
adding
in
good
english
though
with
a
russian
accent
wyndwood
you
must
see
the
little
picture
of
the
by
a
young
follower
of
our
nicolovitch
he
is
exiled
three
years
already
and
has
established
himself
on
your
hospitable
shores
ah
how
it
makes
a
spiritual
ray
among
your
english
platitudes
you
will
come
too
miss
regan
olive
who
had
cast
a
droll
glance
towards
the
painter
at
the
awkward
allusion
to
british
banality
shook
her
head
thank
you
i
hate
children
and
i
am
tired
you
will
find
me
here
nor
and
she
let
herself
sink
into
a
lounge
wyndwood
hesitated
as
if
about
to
introduce
the
two
men
but
the
leonine
dolkovitch
swept
her
off
and
she
had
only
time
to
leave
a
bewitching
smile
behind
her
you
go
and
see
the
child
strang
olive
asked
he
hesitated
in
his
turn
but
she
would
come
back
if
he
waited
would
rather
stay
with
you
if
i
may
he
replied
gallantly
olive
looked
sideways
along
the
lounge
is
room
she
reported
he
seated
himself
at
her
side
and
stolidly
regarded
the
crowd
and
the
opposite
pictures
olive
fanned
herself
silently
at
great
length
the
painter
stealing
a
sudden
glance
at
her
found
her
observing
the
human
spectacle
with
an
air
of
infinite
sadness
you
like
dogs
she
asked
unexpectedly
he
replied
startled
and
with
a
vision
of
sprat
i
kept
one
since
i
was
a
boy
but
why
know
that
woman
there
made
me
think
of
them
that
creature
crowding
round
you
see
that
hag
with
the
false
hair
and
the
real
diamonds
miss
craven
what
has
she
to
do
with
dogs
a
leading
lady
plays
those
erotic
he
looked
at
her
a
little
surprised
by
the
adjective
and
still
unenlightened
what
then
you
know
all
leading
ladies
keep
dogs
to
get
extra
paragraphs
i
hope
you
hate
leading
ladies
i
do
so
virtuous
and
you
know
virtue
is
such
a
feeble
vice
nor
has
a
dog
though
not
a
leading
lady
but
rather
a
led
lady
l
e
d
you
you
mean
led
by
the
dog
whenever
blind
and
the
dog
is
sly
she
said
mysteriously
adding
quickly
dog
all
hers
mine
on
alternate
days
such
a
snob
is
roy
never
go
out
with
her
if
frumpy
he
insists
on
swell
dresses
dear
old
she
be
frumpy
he
asked
she
flashed
a
quick
look
at
him
she
is
very
sweet
and
amusing
she
answered
gravely
is
the
only
woman
i
have
ever
been
able
to
live
you
live
with
her
course
i
chaperon
matthew
smiled
you
think
old
enough
to
chaperon
a
young
widow
his
heart
leaped
know
she
was
a
young
quite
an
old
you
lived
together
long
we
disagree
so
what
way
complexions
go
well
with
each
should
call
that
harmony
not
in
your
technical
nomenclature
but
i
call
it
disagreement
besides
we
a
thought
in
common
i
am
a
well
how
shall
i
define
myself
she
looked
up
quizzingly
her
fan
to
her
lips
belong
to
that
class
of
women
whose
sex
is
a
misfit
and
she
is
she
he
repeated
in
some
suspense
is
the
sort
of
woman
who
renew
the
velvet
edging
on
her
you
puzzle
is
evident
you
know
nothing
of
women
or
have
only
observed
englishwomen
who
mostly
put
up
with
braid
velvet
edging
which
is
an
american
notion
saves
frayed
skirts
and
wears
out
quicker
than
the
stuff
look
at
her
gown
it
trails
mine
fits
she
retains
the
infantile
habit
of
long
clothes
i
am
and
in
short
notice
her
never
do
why
we
wear
so
little
of
he
was
puzzled
by
a
curious
bitterness
in
her
tone
as
well
as
by
a
perplexity
as
to
her
exact
meaning
her
own
frock
was
certainly
prudishly
high
quite
follow
your
definition
anyhow
he
said
try
another
there
are
only
two
classes
of
women
those
who
ought
to
have
been
born
men
and
those
who
ought
never
to
have
been
born
at
all
i
am
of
the
first
of
the
he
shook
his
head
laughingly
but
i
believe
that
of
i
expected
to
be
believed
i
should
have
more
hesitation
in
telling
the
truth
she
replied
gravely
are
both
mistakes
but
nor
is
an
incorrigible
one
you
heard
her
say
dropped
socialism
she
tell
you
dropped
a
power
of
money
too
in
subscriptions
to
the
cause
she
probably
thought
equality
would
come
about
in
three
months
and
that
she
was
merely
disgorging
in
that
why
she
looks
so
sad
me
no
money
trouble
the
matter
then
been
mean
she
grieves
the
contrary
but
marriage
speak
bitterly
yet
you
have
no
personal
i
was
never
her
frank
brusquerie
made
him
feel
an
old
acquaintance
can
not
believe
it
he
said
with
a
smile
if
you
call
a
proposal
a
temptation
i
call
it
a
bare
a
i
if
you
will
man
i
understand
you
he
confessed
again
i
am
a
very
simple
person
ignotum
pro
women
i
know
and
detest
men
i
know
and
admire
if
i
married
one
i
should
know
you
might
find
him
better
than
you
i
expect
to
find
him
better
than
i
expected
i
marry
him
so
i
should
still
be
disappointed
you
see
i
know
just
enough
about
men
to
know
that
they
are
better
left
unknown
i
quite
agree
with
nor
about
the
blue
hills
it
is
better
to
keep
illusions
at
present
i
am
happy
in
the
thought
that
somewhere
in
the
universe
there
exists
a
fine
man
even
the
average
man
is
less
petty
than
the
average
woman
so
that
the
one
fine
man
must
be
a
bayard
he
laughed
if
came
along
and
made
you
an
offer
of
marriage
should
close
with
it
at
are
a
droll
girl
he
could
not
help
saying
are
the
first
of
your
sex
who
has
ever
admitted
to
me
that
men
are
better
than
i
tell
you
how
sly
we
were
a
man
has
one
or
two
big
sins
a
woman
a
bundle
of
little
well
he
said
smiling
of
a
trade
as
a
friend
of
mine
i
understand
you
or
rather
your
friend
she
said
flushing
a
little
rather
brutal
he
takes
the
darwinian
view
of
things
you
know
he
says
all
women
are
in
the
same
trade
so
they
run
one
another
not
running
one
another
down
running
us
down
and
besides
that
the
darwinian
view
at
all
the
males
who
always
seek
the
females
and
develop
the
lively
colors
to
attract
them
you
remember
tennyson
the
spring
a
fuller
crimson
comes
upon
the
but
only
in
the
lower
creation
argued
matthew
strang
you
make
a
distinction
but
i
am
ready
to
agree
with
your
friend
since
he
here
we
what
a
pity
though
that
civilization
has
so
reversed
the
order
of
natural
selection
that
the
human
female
has
to
be
picked
instead
of
picking
the
male
see
the
result
see
what
you
mean
man
has
degenerated
woman
morally
we
adore
the
beauties
of
your
purse
instead
of
your
so
we
develop
brain
to
get
purses
with
really
the
effect
is
not
so
are
cheap
and
they
improve
the
appearance
anyhow
if
people
wore
their
brains
outside
but
who
is
this
brutal
friend
of
yours
who
gauges
my
sex
so
well
do
i
know
him
think
so
just
back
from
strange
am
his
name
herbert
brother
not
an
artist
he
hesitated
and
no
he
said
two
of
a
trade
she
said
slyly
he
smiled
gone
out
of
the
business
become
a
man
he
glanced
furtively
every
now
and
then
to
see
if
wyndwood
was
returning
he
was
conducting
the
conversation
with
only
the
untroubled
surface
of
his
mind
interested
enough
in
his
piquant
companion
but
feeling
her
entirely
as
an
interlude
miss
regan
perceived
his
perturbation
at
last
let
me
monopolize
you
strang
i
am
quite
safe
here
till
nor
returns
there
are
so
many
people
thirsting
for
rather
stay
with
you
he
averred
disingenuously
be
a
mere
man
she
returned
raising
her
dark
eyebrows
your
admirers
think
you
more
than
that
not
fair
for
me
to
keep
you
from
he
was
rather
in
a
quandary
he
could
not
tell
her
he
was
waiting
for
her
friend
to
his
relief
i
see
them
coming
she
said
be
off
duty
in
a
moment
i
must
introduce
you
to
dolkovitch
great
fun
he
will
invite
you
to
his
spiritual
sunday
afternoons
do
you
judge
people
by
their

stared
at
her
mean
when
got
company
when
is
lovely
go
miles
to
see
it
such
curious
curly
dusty
amorphous
things
on
the
pegs
a
cosmopolitan
congress
only
the
unrepresented
nor
goes
to
meet
the
earnest
people
but
i
go
to
see
their
hats
oh
dolkovitch
do
let
me
introduce
strang
he
is
dying
to
know
said
dolkovitch
i
do
not
like
this
word
miss
i
beg
your
pardon
i
forgot
said
olive
strang
is
living
to
know
you
dolkovitch
like
the
ancient
greeks
strang
like
to
think
of
let
you
misrepresent
him
to
a
stranger
olive
said
wyndwood
dolkovitch
is
wide
as
the
poles
asunder
from
pagan
thought
strang
his
teaching
simply
is
that
as
there
is
no
death
but
merely
upward
evolution
the
sooner
the
word
is
banished
from
our
vocabulary
the
her
voice
raised
the
discussion
to
celestial
heights
say
die
cried
miss
regan
enthusiastically
dictionary
should
be
without
so
said
dolkovitch
gravely
european
customs
strang
with
regard
to
death
are
all
in
direct
contradiction
to
our
creed
the
spirit
rises
into
more
blessed
states
and
instead
of
rejoicing
in
festive
attire
we
mourn
for
it
we
put
on
black
and
our
looks
are
black
and
our
hearses
are
black
and
the
horses
they
are
of
black
think
very
proper
said
miss
regan
decisively
love
black
funerals
colored
funerals
would
make
me
feel
she

going
soon
nor
we
you
look
we
are
going
at
once
wyndwood
breathed
the
russian
gave
the
painter
his
card
and
hoped
he
would
come
and
hear
more
of
the
new
gospel
next
sunday
afternoon
spiritual
people
came
from
four
to
seven
strang
made
a
movement
to
accompany
the
ladies
but
wyndwood
begged
him
not
to
trouble
dolkovitch
would
see
them
to
the
carriage
then
she
said
with
an
enchanting
smile
was
so
good
of
you
to
talk
to
words
failed
him
in
reply
fortunately
a
little
gentleman
bowed
to
her
at
that
moment
and
distracted
her
attention
was
general
dale
olive
she
said
a
fine
soldierly
walk
by
ducking
for
bullets
every
moment
remarked
miss
regan
to
know
so
many
people
not
that
i
admire
the
military
bearing
so
unnatural
and
stiff
one
sees
the
drill
behind
even
those
little
wooden
soldiers
i
never
liked
i
hope
he
said
her
at
least
he
could
answer
he
went
to
the
at
five
the
earliest
hour
one
could
decently
go
to
a
reception
commencing
at
four
in
the
meantime
he
had
reread
a
great
deal
of
shelley
who
seemed
to
have
written
a
great
deal
about
eleanor
as
she
became
to
her
secret
thought
though
her
full
name
he
learned
was
the
honorable
wyndwood
and
she
was
the
of
a
viscount
and
connected
by
blood
or
marriage
with
several
pages
of
debrett
in
the
hopelessness
of
his
love
these
ties
were
no
separation
he
did
not
think
of
anything
but
the
blissful
pain
of
seeing
her
again
he
had
ridden
every
morning
in
the
row
but
neither
of
the
friends
had
shown
herself
the
reception
was
held
in
a
flat
half
way
up
a
bleak
stone
staircase
in
the
west
central
district
he
was
so
agitated
that
he
forgot
to
note
the
and
his
first
glance
at
the
company
appalled
him
with
the
sense
of
a
cosmopolitan
chaos
without
form
and
void
over
which
no
light
of
wyndwood
brooded
there
were
mystic
on
the
walls
of
the
narrow
room
and
on
the
gray
marble
stood
a
glass
of
water
in
which
floated
vaguely
the
white
of
an
egg
the
host
introduced
him
to
his
wife
a
tall
haggard
woman
who
gave
him
a
cup
of
tea
and
passed
him
on
to
a
nervously
peering
herr
grundau
who
spoke
to
him
of
the
revival
of
religion
among
the
university
and
passed
him
on
to
mademoiselle
brinskaïa
a
little
yellow
polishwoman
with
eyes
like
live
coals
who
had
been
speaking
every
european
language
in
turn
with
equal
fluency
as
she
knitted
colored
wools
into
some
occult
pattern
have
heard
your
name
she
told
him
in
english
that
sounded
almost
native
as
he
seated
himself
next
to
her
in
the
cushioned
is
so
good
of
you
to
say
so
he
murmured
automatically
not
without
the
astonishment
which
from
the
first
had
pervaded
him
when
strangers
professed
knowledge
of
him
and
which
had
never
quite
worn
off
he
thought
his
peculiar
name
accounted
for
his
notoriety
not
a
spiritual
artist
she
said
half
interrogatively
artist
can
only
be
artistic
he
replied
in
vague
all
my
eye
and
betty
martin
said
mademoiselle
knitting
indefatigably
then
she
smiled
see
i
know
your
a
gradual
silence
fell
among
the
jabbering
gesticulating
crowd
all
eyes
were
directed
alternately
towards
the
glass
on
the
and
mademoiselle
brinskaïa
is
settled
dolkovitch
declared
the
polish
old
maid
rose
solemnly
marched
towards
the
fireplace
and
inspected
the
glass
curiously
noting
the
shape
which
the
had
taken
is
a
she
announced
means
there
was
a
buzz
of
satisfaction
and
a
little
the
blinking
octogenarian
who
had
broken
the
egg
being
cheerfully
complimented
on
his
prospects
the
sibyl
did
not
return
to
matthew
side
and
the
vacant
niche
was
taken
by
a
stout
elderly
motherly
lady
who
was
introduced
to
him
as
the
countess
de
villiers
and
who
regardless
of
the
fact
that
his
eyes
perpetually
wandered
towards
the
door
published
her
autobiography
to
him
from
her
babyhood
in
brazil
to
her
maturity
in
gibraltar
there
could
be
no
close
to
her
story
she
volunteered
for
she
could
never
die
this
drew
attention
even
from
the
door
you
mean
metaphorically
he
said
literally
you
could
not
kill
me
if
you
not
with
a
knife
with
fire
nor
know
i
try
he
said
you
are
going
to
treat
me
facetiously
i
will
not
pursue
the
subject
she
declared
the
red
blood
mantling
in
her
sallow
cheek
am
quite
serious
he
said
deprecatingly
woman
who
can
live
without
eating
can
not
die
pursued
the
countess
mollified
was
an
invalid
and
in
my
convalescence
gradually
worked
my
way
to
the
truth
and
by
means
of
it
i
have
lived
fourteen
weeks
without
food
i
worked
down
from
five
ounces
a
day
to
nothing
dropping
an
ounce
a
day
and
i
lose
a
pound
of
have
fasted
too
he
said
grimly
i
never
found
any
truth
through
he
reflected
bitterly
on
the
anxious
competition
of
people
to
give
him
food
now
that
he
had
plenty
of
his
own
was
this
the
london
which
he
had
tramped
for
work
famished
and
rebellious
must
be
patient
she
answered
earnestly
must
kill
the
man
in
you
then
you
will
have
got
rid
of
the
mortal
part
you
will
be
pure
spirit
part
of
god
existence
is
only
thoughts
everything
good
is
a
everything
evil
a
jesus
was
the
first
discoverer
of
the
truth
and
only
the
in
him
was
crucified
the
mortal
part
only
the
evil
part
of
us
is
mortal
i
have
suppressed
the
in
myself
therefore
i
can
not
do
you
mean
to
say
you
will
always
live
on
though
not
necessarily
on
what
will
happen
will
you
disappear
she
frowned
i
know
you
are
making
fun
of
me
but
i
assure
you
many
eminent
men
have
sat
at
my
feet
even
dolkovitch
says
i
have
a
greater
grip
of
the
truth
the
glorious
truth
of
immortality
than
any
other
woman
in
europe
except
mademoiselle
brinskaïa
and
the
clairvoyant
princess
stevanovna
there
is
nothing
miraculous
i
keep
away
from
society
i
dance
and
paint
but
throughout
all
i
am
struggling
against
the
sort
of
things
do
you
paint
he
asked
feeling
for
firmer
ground
vision
she
said
in
rapt
tones
assurance
that
the
universe
is
all
living
and
all
of
a
sudden
a
conviction
came
to
him
that
she
was
right
that
there
was
no
death
no
room
for
death
eleanor
wyndwood
had
arrived
and
in
the
light
of
her
face
the
noisy
motley
throng
took
meaning
and
music
he
rose
eagerly
but
she
did
not
see
him
in
his
niche
and
he
sat
down
again
awkwardly
the
countess
talked
on
but
he
had
forgotten
even
to
feign
the
listener
he
could
only
see
the
gleam
of
a
creamy
dress
in
rifts
of
the
crowd
which
thickened
momently
presently
he
was
aware
of
miss
regan
who
gave
him
an
abrupt
bow
and
then
crossing
over
to
him
said
in
vexed
accents
am
very
angry
with
you
how
are
you
countess
young
as
ever
i
have
i
done
inquired
matthew
strang
spoiled
my
a
on
it
life
has
so
few
pleasures
one
afford
to
be
please
forgive
me
he
said
half
seriously
too
me
something
bohemian
and
do
it
he
pleaded
come
to
tea
with
me
some
five
with
me
and
nor
that
that
very
bohemian
afraid
not
said
olive
glumly
then
brightening
up
only
a
beginning
and
you
got
time
to
come
either
that
makes
it
a
shall
be
delighted
to
find
time
he
said
looking
his
words
while
they
were
discussing
dates
the
countess
rose
and
stalked
away
looks
offended
he
said
old
countess
said
olive
breaking
up
going
to
live
know
how
sad
we
came
across
her
at
rome
the
eternal
lady
in
the
eternal
city
much
grayer
since
then
earthly
immortality
seems
almost
as
horrible
as
heavenly
fancy
living
for
ever
and
ever
and
ever
no
rest
for
the
righteous
oh
i
do
hope
religion
true
your
friend
friend
brutal
friend
a
queer
girl
he
said
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
tautology
all
girls
are
queer
did
you
ever
know
a
woman
absolutely
sane
he
winced
a
little
shadows
of
his
mother
and
his
wife
flashed
past
she
answered
herself
triumphantly
course
not
all
got
bees
in
our
bonnets
men
even
got
bonnets
except
highlanders
and
they
wear
the
breeches
i
beg
pardon
i
should
have
said
to
a
member
of
the
classes
but
that
always
seems
silly
like
spelling
in
books
with
a
and
a
blank
i
have
a
lovely
private
swear
would
you
like
to
hear
it
he
laughed
assent
the
pink
lady
who
always
forgets
her
bodice
is
looking
shocked
she
know
sanscrit
or
something
and
means
foundation
of
the
kingdom
of
laugh
it
really
does
there
is
a
cousin
of
the
guicowar
of
baroda
over
there
you
can
ask
him
why
i
have
even
got
nor
to
swear
to
swear
it
like
temperance
better
go
over
to
her
he
said
snapping
at
the
opportunity
else
accuse
me
of
cutting
her
he
pushed
a
whit
rudely
through
the
throng
but
to
his
horror
he
found
eleanor
distributing
farewells
she
smiled
faintly
at
him
as
her
magnetic
fingers
touched
his
for
a
moment
wicked
things
have
you
been
saying
to
mademoiselle
brinskaïa
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
hardly
said
a
word
to
she
shook
her
head
and
passed
towards
the
door
he
spent
some
wretched
days
wondering
if
he
had
offended
her
and
what
the
little
yellow
woman
had
been
saying
about
him
he
put
the
question
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
at
the
in
the
dainty
of
the
tiny
mayfair
house
which
the
oddly
assorted
couple
had
taken
for
the
season
wyndwood
would
not
say
but
miss
regan
cried
out
make
such
a
mystery
nor
make
the
man
think
accused
of
murder
or
drinking
his
tea
out
of
a
saucer
the
polish
priestess
says
she
like
your
auras
are
auras
he
asked
relieved
and
puzzled
latin
for
airs
of
course
laughed
olive
her
mystical
way
of
saying
you
give
yourself
airs
yes
you
do
disapproving
of
our
furniture
now
but
through
objecting
to
furniture
that
suited
my
complexion
and
vice
versa
we
compromised
by
getting
furniture
in
discord
with
both
our
complexions
the
beautiful
photos
you
see
all
about
you
are
mine
i
mean
my
collection
they
are
actresses
i
adore
beautiful
women
after
what
you
told
me
about
the
unimportance
of
the
likeness
i
shall
consider
them
works
of
art
i
have
always
thought
that
photographs
are
intended
as
a
protection
against
the
curiosity
of
the
public
but
for
them
actresses
would
be
liable
to
be
recognized
and
mobbed
in
the
streets
great
heavens
forgotten
the
and
with
this
unexpected
exclamation
olive
rushed
out
of
the
room
would
insist
on
baking
scones
herself
wyndwood
explained
with
an
affectionate
smile
is
deliciously
odd
he
replied
laughing
you
find
her
so
got
used
to
her
a
monotony
in
the
variety
behind
it
all
i
see
always
this
one
fact
the
noblest
creature
in
the
he
was
touched
by
the
enthusiastic
tribute
so
different
from
amused
estimate
of
her
friend
must
find
it
very
pleasant
to
live
with
her
he
said
especially
but
she
shuddered
and
did
not
complete
the
sentence
he
read
in
her
face
the
tragedy
of
an
unhappy
marriage
his
eyes
grew
moist
with
pity
he
felt
a
mad
fighting
passion
against
the
inevitable
past
is
so
good
she
said
brokenly
was
of
my
family
an
irish
branch
but
she
quarrelled
with
them
all
her
father
her
sisters
and
came
to
live
with
me
fortunately
she
is
immensely
rich
in
her
own
right
and
independent
of
them
to
a
turn
cried
miss
regan
rushing
in
with
the
scones
i
feared
i
was
king
alfred
at
tea
they
talked
art
it
was
an
exquisite
sensation
to
have
these
charming
ladies
treat
him
as
sir
oracle
he
was
surprised
to
learn
that
in
her
girlhood
miss
regan
had
displayed
considerable
talent
for
sculpture
but
had
her
hands
of
the
on
seeing
the
torso
of
victory
in
the
louvre
he
remonstrated
with
her
insisting
that
technical
skill
came
slowly
with
infinite
labor
there
were
things
he
himself
wanted
to
do
all
sorts
of
new
things
that
he
had
never
yet
done
one
day
he
would
try
to
do
them
when
he
had
time
wyndwood
spoke
contemptuously
of
technical
skill
in
comparison
with
soul
but
here
olive
mischievously
took
up
the
cudgels
for
craftsmanship
and
led
the
rather
reluctant
painter
into
an
eloquent
exposition
of
the
joys
of
technical
mastery
of
doing
what
you
would
with
your
material
wyndwood
at
last
caught
the
fire
of
his
enthusiasm
and
astonished
him
by
expressing
his
sense
of
the
joy
of
art
better
than
himself
under
the
passion
of
her
words
he
wondered
that
he
could
ever
have
wasted
his
time
on
portraits
for
mere
money
or
on
scamped
pictures
for
exhibitions
when
all
these
interesting
problems
were
waiting
to
be
wrought
out
ah
but
miss
regan
was
wrong
he
felt
in
thinking
these
problems
the
and
of
art
it
was
soul
that
was
the
essence
of
art
art
had
no
except
as
the
expression
of
soul
of
the
upward
aspiration
of
the
spirit
towards
the
good
and
the
beautiful
and
the
true
a
trinity
that
was
mysteriously
one
chapter
iv
ferment
the
sands
of
the
season
were
running
out
but
matthew
strang
sifted
them
for
every
grain
of
the
gold
of
meetings
with
eleanor
wyndwood
he
was
shy
of
formal
visits
to
the
house
he
did
not
venture
on
the
conventional
course
of
asking
her
to
sit
to
him
for
he
would
not
consciously
feed
the
flame
of
a
passion
that
must
be
hopeless
but
with
that
curious
illogicality
which
distinguishes
man
from
the
brute
he
called
in
accident
to
arrange
their
rendezvous
pursuing
possibility
with
a
perseverance
that
made
it
probability
he
could
not
follow
eleanor
to
all
her
fashionable
fastnesses
as
easily
as
to
the
shrines
of
spirituality
for
to
be
born
well
is
still
a
necessity
of
life
in
some
circles
but
they
met
often
enough
amid
the
monotonous
glitter
which
was
the
birthright
and
second
nature
to
the
man
his
eye
perpetually
sought
her
in
chattering
in
cool
gardens
on
congested
staircases
in
whirling
ballrooms
finding
every
place
dark
and
empty
till
she
filled
and
illumined
the
scene
she
gleamed
upon
him
as
unreal
and
insubstantial
as
the
figures
he
had
once
noted
in
one
of
these
ballrooms
completely
girdled
by
electric
lights
which
robbing
the
dancers
of
shadows
made
them
and
phantasmal
but
he
did
not
follow
out
the
analogy
or
suspect
it
might
be
his
own
love
which
was
surrounding
her
with
this
spiritualizing
electric
illumination
each
time
he
saw
her
he
resolved
never
to
see
her
again
he
could
never
tell
her
what
was
in
his
heart
never
insult
her
exquisite
purity
with
the
avowal
of
his
love
even
though
that
love
were
clarified
to
unimagined
ethereality
by
her
stainless
radiance
of
soul
and
each
time
the
possibility
of
seeing
her
drew
nigh
again
he
told
himself
that
he
needed
her
for
his
art
that
she
was
drawing
him
up
from
the
slough
of
banality
that
now
for
the
first
time
his
soul
was
really
opening
out
to
the
appeal
of
the
higher
beauty
not
that
he
had
as
yet
begun
to
express
the
higher
beauty
he
had
simply
abandoned
the
old
he
was
too
restless
to
work
to
concentrate
himself
he
flitted
between
the
unfinished
and
the
projected
painting
in
and
painting
out
he
took
long
rides
in
the
middle
of
the
day
to
the
amazement
of
his
faithful
he
read
emotional
literature
once
an
unconscious
hostess
gave
him
company
at
dinner
wyndwood
was
in
stately
black
with
a
bunch
of
violets
at
her
bosom
it
was
an
enchanted
meal
they
talked
of
poetry
and
he
seemed
to
be
dining
off
poetry
too
the
wines
where
special
brands
of
nectar
laid
down
by
the
gods
in
the
golden
age
the
meats
were
ambrosia
the
sweets
a
beauty
as
of
hebe
transfigured
the
faces
of
the
it
seemed
only
natural
that
the
beautiful
stately
creature
at
his
side
should
overflow
with
quotations
from
religious
poetry
was
she
not
herself
a
religious
poem
his
recent
feverish
readings
had
branded
lines
on
his
own
heart
he
was
able
to
answer
her
in
lyric
antiphony
his
other
neighbor
he
simply
forgot
though
she
was
a
consort
and
a
patroness
of
the
arts
with
printed
views
on
the
genuineness
of
old
masters
there
was
an
old
picture
of
his
own
on
the
opposite
wall
and
the
fear
lest
eleanor
should
raise
her
eyes
to
it
was
all
the
serpent
in
his
paradise
his
subconsciousness
noted
with
pleasure
however
that
the
painting
had
mellowed
a
proof
that
his
theory
of
colors
was
right
he
watched
with
furtive
fascination
the
play
of
beautiful
botticelli
hands
plying
her
knife
and
fork
as
she
explained
how
under
the
influence
of
dolkovitch
she
had
drifted
away
from
socialism
whose
professors
always
laid
too
much
stress
on
the
needs
of
the
body
but
she
apologized
for
having
spoken
rudely
of
his
of
from
a
mere
knowledge
of
its
title
he
had
made
her
understand
now
that
the
appeal
of
painting
must
always
be
sensuous
and
that
subject
was
only
an
excuse
for
draughtsmanship
and
coloring
and
she
startled
him
by
saying
she
liked
that
picture
of
his
on
the
opposite
wall
which
he
had
been
hoping
had
escaped
her
eye
it
became
at
once
glorified
to
his
own
after
the
ladies
had
retired
the
gentlemen
talked
about
a
newly
invented
torpedo
the
finances
of
india
and
the
prospects
of
the
conservatives
the
conversation
sounded
almost
indecent
and
he
was
glad
eleanor
was
not
there
to
hear
it
he
took
no
part
in
the
fatuous
discussion
contenting
himself
with
watching
face
amid
the
wreaths
of
his
even
in
the
flesh
the
face
had
for
him
something
of
this
vaporous
elusive
incorporeality
in
the
the
inevitable
miss
regan
claimed
his
attention
eleanor
was
playing
mendelssohn
and
he
would
have
liked
to
listen
but
olive
was
less
original
have
never
honored
our
again
she
said
reproachfully
he
murmured
that
he
was
busy
was
the
charm
of
your
coming
she
reminded
him
had
the
sensation
of
beguiling
you
to
play
truant
but
i
suppose
the
tea
was
bad
nor
make
tea
was
beautiful
he
said
smiling
we
disturbing
the
music
the
contrary
nor
is
giving
us
ohne
wörte
and
we
have
to
supply
the
words
i
wonder
what
makes
her
play
such
things
then
it
must
have
been
the
he
shook
his
head
and
pursed
his
lips
and
the
music
flowed
on
like
a
lovely
moonlit
stream
he
was
drifting
on
the
stream
with
eleanor
as
in
those
days
of
young
romance
he
had
dreamed
of
lovers
drifting
a
mystic
silver
haze
was
shed
from
the
moon
that
sailed
softly
through
the
lambent
starry
sky
the
whisper
of
the
wind
among
the
trees
and
the
quiet
lapping
of
the
water
made
a
dulcet
stillness
that
was
punctuated
by
the
passionate
of
the
nightingale
mysterious
palaces
of
night
glided
along
the
banks
behind
dim
gardens
wafting
drowsy
odors
the
thought
shook
him
that
the
world
held
such
lovers
lovers
who
were
not
brought
together
for
a
moment
and
hurled
apart
in
the
accidental
whirl
of
society
atoms
lovers
whose
lips
were
not
eternally
sundered
but
lovers
who
were
each
sunshine
and
moonlight
and
music
daily
nightly
perennially
he
alone
was
doomed
to
eternal
loneliness
nay
to
that
aggravated
form
of
loneliness
which
is
shared
with
a
partner
came
across
your
cynical
friend
the
other
he
started
becoming
conscious
that
his
eyes
were
full
of
sweet
hopeless
tears
he
murmured
automatically
the
cousin
you
told
me
i
tell
you
of
him
you
remember
you
told
me
he
said
all
women
are
in
the
same
trade
well
he
is
veritably
a
cynic
of
cynics
for
he
candidly
informed
me
after
i
had
been
bantering
and
mystifying
him
with
my
foreknowledge
of
him
that
he
had
simply
quoted
did
you
meet
him
he
asked
a
little
interested
the
reception
a
fortnight
ago
i
call
him
the
minister
of
the
interior
such
an
epicure
the
politician
i
mean
not
your
cousin
there
was
lord
fashborough
there
the
man
just
been
appointed
president
of
the
cruelty
to
children
commission
and
who
glittered
with
stars
and
orders
like
a
begum
he
it
was
introduced
your
cousin
at
my
request
of
course
your
cousin
told
me
the
begum
and
he
had
travelled
together
in
spain
when
the
appetite
for
and
was
insatiable
i
have
never
been
in
spain
and
two
of
my
favorite
illusions
were
destroyed
at
one
fell
blow
it
seems
that
they
simply
push
reluctant
decrepit
old
horses
on
to
the
horns
of
the
bulls
and
then
the
spanish
women
your
cousin
describes
them
as
ugly
and
he
shuddered
why
would
miss
regan
perversely
obtrude
the
prose
of
life
upon
his
consciousness
he
would
not
answer
her
he
tried
to
drift
again
with
the
magic
stream
but
the
spell
was
broken
he
knew
it
was
music
that
made
the
pictures
and
that
the
odors
came
from
the
flowers
at
throat
is
painting
portrait
she
went
on
indifferently
he
had
to
answer
her
now
in
a
stifled
interrogative
masking
a
sudden
sharp
agony
and
foreboding
herbert
he
asked
her
to
give
him
some
sittings
he
altogether
become
a
critic
you
introduced
him
to
her
did
of
his
request
was
rather
hasty
it
it
the
first
time
we
met
him
again
at
the
russian
how
does
wyndwood
know
he
can
paint
olive
laughed
quietly
he
said
so
he
usually
tells
the
truth
i
fancy
but
he
an
artist
he
was
a
gold
medallist
of
the
royal
academy
he
answered
with
unaccustomed
bitterness
a
mad
envy
was
consuming
him
why
had
he
not
asked
wyndwood
to
sit
to
him
seeing
that
her
consent
was
so
facile
was
he
always
to
stand
by
while
the
best
of
life
was
seized
and
carried
off
by
the
bolder
the
more
reckless
nay
by
the
more
unworthy
the
remembrance
that
herbert
had
the
right
and
he
had
not
did
not
dilute
his
bitterness
though
it
brought
a
hot
flush
to
his
cheek
who
was
he
to
see
profanation
in
the
juxtaposition
of
eleanor
with
a
man
like
herbert
however
ignoble
conception
of
womanhood
had
not
he
himself
always
found
him
lovable
you
friends
olive
asked
divining
alienation
in
his
tone
he
felt
remorseful
we
are
great
friends
he
answered
with
cordial
warmth
was
very
kind
to
me
when
i
first
came
to
asked
me
to
sit
as
well
olive
pursued
satisfied
matthew
strang
felt
the
tension
in
his
brain
relax
are
you
going
to
i
hate
flattery
so
i
sacrificed
nor
instead
of
course
i
shall
go
and
sit
by
her
though
not
with
her
curious
the
subtleties
of
you
will
still
chaperon
her
he
said
with
a
joyous
smile
never
neglect
a
pleasant
duty
she
answered
placidly
we
can
only
give
him
a
few
he
interrupted
with
an
involuntary
exclamation
of
relief
leaving
he
looked
blank
now
you
indeed
course
why
are
you
surprised
you
think
we
were
proper
nor
wanted
the
eternal
homburg
or
switzerland
but
resolved
to
show
her
england
like
most
travelled
cockneys
she
thinks
the
capital
of
london
and
i
want
to
teach
her
geography
so
off
to
will
enjoy
devonshire
especially
the
creamery
what
christened
the
little
village
i
discovered
so
you
know
if
you
ever
want
a
cup
of
tea
we
shall
have
going
on
there
also
patronize
the
will
he
said
with
an
instant
resolution
to
take
tea
both
in
mayfair
and
in
devonshire
right
send
a
to
meet
you
at
least
find
it
waiting
at
the
station
for
passengers
do
you
know
whom
i
should
like
to
meet
most
of
all
men
living
the
pope
the
czar
be
absurd
the
rev
septimus
wheercastle
a
local
says
rev
septimus
wheercastle
speaks
in
very
favorable
terms
of
the
it
delicious
imagine
a
gentleman
in
a
white
tie
patronizing
an
undercliff
but
then
the
clergy
are
always
patronizing
the
almighty
so
why
not
his
works
he
said
indicating
the
proximity
of
the
bishop
he
beautiful
she
asked
in
an
awed
whisper
a
privilege
never
to
be
mistaken
for
a
waiter
i
am
so
proud
of
the
bishops
in
my
family
we
have
a
pair
with
gaiters
to
match
both
high
church
atheists
they
are
the
joys
of
my
life
they
and
the
dowager
duchess
who
wears
and
raves
for
blood
me
blood
she
cries
as
she
denounces
modern
society
stabbing
her
potato
with
her
fork
sarah
to
matthew
strang
who
still
had
a
vague
reverence
for
duchesses
it
was
troubling
to
see
them
through
the
eyes
of
relatives
for
whom
they
were
common
clay
but
this
had
always
been
his
disappointment
the
further
he
penetrated
into
the
arcana
of
aristocracy
and
into
the
ranks
of
the
distinguished
nobody
ever
seemed
quite
so
imposing
as
his
or
her
name
in
the
paper
taken
in
the
mass
aristocracy
of
birth
or
brain
was
dazzling
overwhelming
but
the
individual
was
always
amiably
imperfect
with
the
exception
of
course
of
the
one
perfect
being
in
the
universe
eleanor
wyndwood
think
much
of
your
family
miss
regan
he
said
smiling
and
they
return
the
compliment
they
realize
how
near
doomsday
is
for
us
aristocrats
we
must
disappear
we
have
played
our
part
i
know
i
suppose
the
upper
classes
the
people
of
leisure
existed
to
evolve
culture
that
can
now
be
grafted
on
to
the
artisan
and
both
the
upper
and
the
lower
classes
can
disappear
we
want
the
amalgam
now
culture
without
its
vices
and
work
without
its
we
ever
get
what
we
want
she
smiled
with
ineffable
sadness
and
weariness
sometimes
think
that
that
makes
life
worth
living
that
and
bishops
this
is
the
only
world
in
which
bishops
could
happen
there
is
some
consolation
too
in
royal
and
kangaroos
do
you
think
there
is
any
other
planet
in
which
ladies
walk
backward
or
animals
hop
i
wonder
when
one
feels
weary
of
the
burden
of
existence
one
thinks
of
the
humor
of
creation
and
stays
on
it
is
a
delicious
you
mean
that
you
enjoy
the
imperfections
of
life
know
what
i
mean
i
hate
to
see
people
and
i
hate
to
see
people
unhappy
people
pain
me
and
happy
people
irritate
me
what
i
mean
oh
i
think
i
see
it
at
last
it
is
the
unintelligent
people
that
i
hate
to
see
unhappy
and
the
intelligent
people
that
i
hate
to
see
happy
people
who
have
brains
and
are
happy
have
souls
the
fools
ought
to
have
creature
comforts
because
they
are
fools
enough
to
value
them
before
all
else
how
i
envy
my
capacity
for
envying
me
thank
you
strang
you
have
enabled
me
to
understand
the
music
stopped
but
the
player
was
at
once
monopolized
by
the
bishop
fragments
of
their
conversation
reached
the
ears
of
the
couple
trying
to
convert
him
to
christianity
olive
observed
gravely
i
tell
you
she
was
the
most
unpractical
creature
always
leading
forlorn
is
herbert
my
cousin
painting
her
he
asked
only
had
one
sitting
to
be
done
but
she
had
her
hair
dressed
specially
such
a
waste
of
time
and
was
manicured
and
the
man
took
as
long
manicuring
her
as
if
she
had
been

what
will
she
wear
a
sentimental
expression
the
sort
of
look
you
see
in
a
face
when
sitting
on
the
stairs
with
her
hand
in
a
a
shudder
traversed
her
shoulders
crinkling
the
blue
bodice
that
covered
them
the
rest
she
will
be
clothed
in
one
of
those
creamy
gowns
that
become
her
so
before
the
evening
was
over
olive
was
induced
to
sing
matthew
strang
was
startled
to
find
her
choosing
a
and
he
was
as
astonished
by
the
passionate
intensity
of
her
vocalization
as
by
the
beauty
of
her
rich
contralto
voice
she
sang
de
la
vie
toi
qui
pas
and
the
notes
melted
exquisitely
in
pity
the
tears
returned
to
his
eyes
it
was
his
tragedy
it
was
tragedy
it
was
tragedy
ninon

de
la

very
few
days
went
by
before
he
rang
bell
the
mental
image
of
eleanor
sitting
to
herbert
was
the
motor
that
drove
him
to
call
he
had
only
seen
his
volatile
cousin
once
or
twice
since
they
had
dined
together
at
the
herbert
curious
facility
for
taking
up
and
dropping
people
had
persisted
unchanged
but
the
couple
were
destined
to
meet
now
for
victorias
and
hansoms
hovered
outside
house
and
matthew
strang
found
that
he
had
stumbled
upon
a
formal
home
at
which
herbert
was
fetching
and
carrying
to
perspiring
beauty
the
popular
painter
noted
with
a
novel
thrill
of
alarm
the
boyish
good
looks
of
his
friend
whose
spruce
smiling
figure
was
so
visibly
the
cynosure
of
feminine
eyes
happily
for
his
peace
of
mind
eleanor
was
too
busy
welcoming
her
miscellaneous
visitors
to
allot
much
attention
to
herbert
who
seemed
indeed
amply
content
with
engaging
the
interest
of
half
a
dozen
fair
women
not
counting
an
occasional
interlude
of
miss
regan
matthew
strang
slowly
ploughed
his
way
to
the
hostess
a
angel
in
white
through
the
block
of
bonneted
ladies
amid
which
an
occasional
man
stood
out
unpicturesque
seem
surprised
to
see
me
he
said
in
low
tones
into
which
he
infused
an
intimate
note
indeed
said
eleanor
with
a
little
frank
laugh
did
you
know
it
was
my
day
he
smiled
mysteriously
wondering
the
while
if
she
could
hear
his
heart
beat
above
the
feminine
babble
ought
not
to
have
come
pursued
eleanor
with
a
little
pout
that
made
her
face
adorable
pay
you
the
compliment
of
not
asking
you
to
our
and
this
is
how
you
appreciate
me
he
said
intoxicatingly
flattered
do
appreciate
it
i
know
i
came
for
a
cup
of
tea
with
no
idea
of
fighting
for
let
me
give
it
you
do
you
take
sugar
and
she
handed
him
the
cup
which
he
took
with
a
hand
that
trembled
then
a
press
of
fresh
people
cut
him
off
from
her
and
she
made
no
effort
to
keep
him
by
her
side
gloom
invaded
his
breast
again
he
had
to
speak
to
some
of
the
crowd
and
he
did
his
duty
with
ill
grace
he
feared
it
would
be
too
presumptuous
to
outstay
the
intrusive
crew
so
he
resolved
to
escape
as
soon
as
possible
but
herbert
captured
him
with
a
hearty
and
introduced
him
with
a
certain
proprietary
pride
to
his
bevy
of
dames
and
he
was
perforce
added
to
the
applausive
circle
in
the
centre
of
which
herbert
quizzed
the
rest
of
the
company
and
the
universe
at
large
that
lily
talking
with
wyndwood

said
catching
passing

an

her
revenge

that

a
pity
said
herbert
any
rate
it
is
true
as
far
as
it
goes
to
call
miss
hair
would
be
considered
cynical
yet
it
is
but
accurate
observation
the
inaccurate
observer
of

would
call
it
auburn
not
seeing
that
it
is
only
auburn
and
that
it
goes
through
as
many
editions
as
her
books
similarly
to
call
her
complexion
be
rudeness
interrupted
olive
more
severely
as
i
heard
her
asking
wyndwood
to
introduce
to
her
the
young
man
who
looked
so
much
like
the
hero
of
one
of
her
that
puts
another
complexion
on
the
matter
said
herbert
lightly
under
cover
of
the
confusion
of
feminine
compliment
that
greeted
the
quick
sally
matthew
strang
slipped
away
from
the
sight
of
the
smiles
and
the
sound
of
the
laughter
even
had
he
been
free
what
chance
would
he
have
had
pitted
against
his
brilliant
cousin
he
knew
himself
a
silent
man
scarcely
speaking
unless
abnormally
moved
much
less
scintillating
he
had
only
one
talent
one
poor
talent
for
expressing
the
beautiful
to
one
sense
and
this
one
talent
he
had
prostituted
everything
grew
black
to
his
morbid
mood
the
dying
afternoon
cool
had
no
beauty
for
him
the
speckless
grooms
outside
the
door
irritated
him
the
shining
carriages
dashing
along
the
great
arteries
of
the
west
end
bearing
their
lolling
occupants
to
dress
and
dinner
stirred
him
to
something
of
the
same
revolt
that
he
had
felt
when
he
had
walked
the
metropolis
of
wealth
and
fashion
in
broken
boots
after
all
he
had
never
really
entered
this
circle
of
pleasure
it
had
always
been
a
he
could
not
step
into
beautiful
as
his
boots
were
externally
there
had
always
been
a
nail
a
pebble
inside
that
adverse
atom
which
according
to
the
philosopher
suffices
to
destroy
happiness
his
had
always
been
a
life
of
labor
of
misery
he
was
still
of
the
classes
of
those
whom
fate
if
not
man
grinds
down
whose
lives
slip
by
in
a
vain
yearning
for
the
sun
who
see
happiness
as
a
phantasm
that
is
only
solid
for
others
and
love
as
the
mocking
mirage
of
a
beauty
that
is
far
away
he
was
angry
so
unreasonably
angry
that
the
unreason
seemed
a
reason
for
fresh
anger
with
himself
and
he
was
angry
not
only
with
himself
but
with
herbert
with
the
world
aye
with
eleanor
wyndwood
and
her
idle
visitors
reeking
of
the
chattering
of
poems
pictures
and
symphonies
the
thought
of
his
mother
came
up
from
dim
recesses
of
memory
still
babbling
in
the
asylum
that
was
her
haven
of
refuge
after
a
life
of
storm
and
stress
and
sorrow
and
weary
watchings
for
a
vagrant
mate
and
he
was
jealous
of
eleanor
for
her
sake
jealous
of
her
beauty
her
breeding
her
wealth
her
fine
dresses
her
carriage
her
fashionable
visitors
jealous
of
all
that
made
her
different
from
his
mother
of
all
that
made
her
life
fuller
freer
higher
richer
of
all
in
fine
that
made
him
love
her
ah
god
how
he
loved
her
he
could
scarcely
keep
back
the
hysteric
sobs
that
swelled
at
his
throat
but
they
had
always
been
shut
out
from
the
sunshine
his
mother
and
he
happiness
oh
to
clasp
it
to
hold
it
tight
nothing
counted
except
happiness
ambition
success
art
money
alike
vain
gauds
shadows
he
walked
past
his
turning
and
far
beyond
lights
began
to
twinkle
in
the
great
tired
city
the
summer
evening
brooded
fresh
and
cool
over
the
vast
stretches
of
dusty
stone
when
at
last
he
reached
his
studio
the
sun
had
set
he
saw
the
pale
mystically
tender
at
the
end
of
the
long
suburban
avenue
of
green
trees
and
yellow
it
spoke
to
him
of
peace
and
rest
and
resignation
and
some
secret
beauty
behind
all
not
many
days
later
his
restless
feet
took
him
again
to
the
mayfair
house
he
would
speak
out
at
some
opportunity
which
the
shrewd
kindly
olive
would
not
fail
to
afford
him
he
would
tell
eleanor
all
she
meant
to
him
how
she
was
becoming
the
pivot
of
his
thought
how
she
and
she
alone
might
inspire
his
art
to
higher
purpose
he
would
not
ask
for
love
only
for
a
noble
friendship
he
needed
an
understanding
soul
to
sympathize
with
his
inmost
self
his
aspirations
his
agonies
he
had
always
been
hedged
in
by
thick
barriers
of
ice
through
which
no
human
soul
had
ever
pierced
no
one
knew
what
tinder
for
divine
fires
lay
awaiting
the
spark
within
nor
how
cold
and
lonely
he
felt
in
his
glacial
isolation
but
at
first
his
visit
threatened
to
be
even
more
disappointing
than
the
last
another
man
was
taking
tea
or
rather
eating
nougat
with
wyndwood
and
miss
regan
young
and
fascinating
of
feature
but
with
a
fatal
air
of
the
minor
poet
and
a
poet
indeed
he
proved
to
be
a
poet
of
considerable
pretensions
who
might
win
the
bays
if
only
he
could
get
over
his
unfortunate
appearance
which
seemed
to
tie
him
down
to
sugared
prettiness
and
elegant
concetti
matthew
strang
had
read
one
of
his
dainty
volumes
wherein
dapper
lyrics
posed
in
the
centre
of
pages
and
he
wondered
resentfully
why
wyndwood
did
not
lecture
him
into
spirituality
instead
of
feeding
him
with
nougat
which
his
poetry
already
resembled
but
though
harold
lavender
was
accommodating
enough
to
go
soon
matthew
strang
profited
little
by
his
retirement
from
the
field
for
eleanor
seemed
to
be
in
a
freakish
mood
as
if
the
contagion
of
olive
had
infected
her
or
the
nougat
had
made
her
terrestrial
and
she
played
a
lively
second
to
her
vivacious
friend
in
recapitulating
the
charms
of
their
dog
roy
a
slumbrous
scotch
collie
that
he
had
barely
noted
before
but
which
now
became
the
climax
of
creation

up
the
ball

strayed
and
information
was
lodged
at
a
that
a
collie
with
a
black
ring
round

tail
had
been
found
we
told
the
superintendent
ours
had
no
such
inaccurate
observation
of
life
you
see
strang
broke
in
olive
according
to
your
cousin
delivers
one
from
cynicism
has
something
to
do
with
dogs
it
observed
wyndwood
smilingly
said
olive
must
get
strang
to
define
cynicism
as
the
accurate
observation
of
dogs
forget
to
tell
him
nor
when
you
sit
to
him
matthew
strang
moved
uncomfortably
on
his
seat
raging
inwardly
and
scarcely
knowing
whether
he
was
more
jealous
of
herbert
or
of
roy
that
superintendent
must
have
been
a
cynic
wyndwood
went
on
he
recommended
us
to
go
and
look
at
the
dog
all
the
same
it
was
a
wild
expedition
nearly
eleven
at
night
we
routed
out
a
nest
of
costers
who
lived
over
a
stable
and
were
invaded
by
means
of
a
ladder
i
felt
like
a
robber
viking
all
and
adventure
it
was
glorious
and
roy
came
bounding
out
and
nearly
toppled
you
over
and
all
the
little
costers
came
crowding
out
of
bed
in
their
and
you
gave
coster
a
sovereign
for
them
in
mistake
for
a
wyndwood
went
into
a
fit
of
mirth
over
the
recollection
for
once
her
melodious
laugh
grated
upon
his
ears
what
in
the
world
was
there
to
laugh
about
it
seemed
all
the
most
puerile
nonsense
he
could
have
cried
more
easily
his
lively
air
said
olive
intuitive
sympathy
is
wonderful
he
is
sad
when
you
weep
and
merry
when
you
the
painter
merely
heard
the
dog
panting
like
an
impatient
wants
a
run
i
think
he
observed
ungraciously
you
should
see
him
run
cried
wyndwood
makes
one
feel
young
again
to
see
him
scampering
up
hill
and
down
dale
even
a
mudhill
delights
him
it
reminds
him
of
his
native
moors
it
roy
dear
roy
stared
at
her
with
large
unblinking
eyes
we
are
not
dressed
well
enough
to
go
out
with
him
now
said
olive
told
you
what
a
snob
he
was
strang
shake
paws
with
the
gentleman
dear
smart
enough
even
for
your
tastes
see
how
he
likes
you
strang
if
he
the
skin
over
his
dear
old
nose
would
snarl
up
into
gathers
and
puckers
and
frills
there
his
favorite
attitude
on
his
with
his
placably
on
a
beloved
lap
now
he
is
happy
how
simple
life
is
for
him
lucky
dog
you
forget
that
he
too
has
his
ideal
his
unachieved
aspiration
said
wyndwood
disappointment
of
his
life
is
that
he
catch
birds
he
snaps
at
everything
that
soars
in
air
even
insects
it
exasperates
him
to
find
things
hovering
mockingly
overhead
in
defiance
of
gravity
he
sits
on
his
haunches
and
wails
over
the
emptiness
of
matthew
strang
gave
roy
a
kindlier
pat
but
the
creature
was
still
stretched
on
the
tapis
of
conversation
and
olive
proceeded
to
a
whimsical
account
of
the
partition
of
roy
between
eleanor
and
herself
as
joint
since
they
could
not
bisect
the
collie
he
belonged
to
each
on
alternate
days
so
that
if
he
were
lost
again
the
onus
would
rest
on
the
mistress
for
the
day
by
this
time
the
painter
could
hardly
refrain
from
kicking
the
dog
and
when
wyndwood
added
that
roy
was
only
eighteen
months
old
he
rose
to
go
expression
changed
not
running
away
yet
she
said
must
he
murmured
his
abating
under
the
sweet
seriousness
of
her
face
you
talked
to
us
at
all
we
want
to
hear
more
about
be
talked
he
said
still
surly
any
materials
for
practical
demonstrations
said
olive
even
a
should
love
to
be
an
artist
cried
wyndwood
feel
beauty
growing
under
hand
what
a
sense
of
creative
divinity
i
never
sit
to
an
artist
without
thinking
what
a
privilege
is
his
now
what
you
laughing
at
olive
except
your
subtle
way
of
complimenting
yourself
on
your
good
looks
now
if
strang
will
be
good
and
waste
a
little
more
valuable
time
on
two
foolish
women
i
will
pay
him
a
he
sat
down
his
curiosity
stimulated
and
olive
producing
a
box
of
turkish
cigarettes
asked
if
he
objected
to
her
smoking
permission
being
obtained
she
got
him
to
apply
a
light
to
her
cigarette
and
then
bade
him
smoke
one
himself
he
was
relieved
to
find
wyndwood
an
abstainer
said
olive
puffing
out
a
thin
cloud
is
the
highest
compliment
i
can
pay
a
man
to
expose
myself
in
all
my
horror
i
smoke
neither
for
toothache
nor
neuralgia
but
for
sheer
viciousness
see
the
result
of
our
visit
to
podnieff
nor
picked
up
ideals
and
i
smoke
perhaps
they
are
the
same
thing
in
the
matthew

dissented
vehemently
are
the
only
they
are
the
only
things
that
change
retorted
miss
regan
ideal
woman

and
birdseye
in
long
clay
eleanor
wyndwood
came
to
his
assistance
and
together
they
did
battle
with
olive
who
took
up
the
most
perverse
philistine
positions
and
fought
as
if
for
life
eluding
shuffling
dodging
equivocating
turning
twisting
doubling
upon
herself
with
the
most
daring
defiance
of
consistency
and
the
most
bizarre
flashes
of
wit
and
argument
she
would
snatch
a
victory
by
specious
logic
that
could
only
hold
for
a
moment
and
stand
in
as
serenely
mocking
triumph
upon
a
crumbling
as
if
she
knew
herself
upon
a
rock
and
was
not
about
to
bound
off
to
the
next
the
instant
the
tide
of
reason
swept
this
one
hopelessly
away
the
painter
found
a
celestial
knitting
of
soul
in
thus
fighting
side
by
side
with
eleanor
he
did
not
blench
even
when
she
quoted
a
quatrain
from
harold
lavender
to
enforce
her
point
but
the
shades
of
earth
returned
when
she
referred
to
herbert
strang
is
an
example
of
a
man
who
has
absolutely
nothing
to
gain
from
art
who
need
it
who
has
means
to
whose
sceptical
spirit
the
applause
of
the
world
is
indifferent
and
yet
the
other
morning
when
the
sunshine
called
one
to
the
joys
of
the
far
he
sat
for
hours
toiling
painfully
at
his
art
and
fretting
because
he
had
allowed
his
right
hand
to
lose
its
cunning
he
had
neglected
the
ideal
but
now
his
soul
thirsts
for
it
again
and
the
ideal
is
matthew
strang
felt
a
malicious
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
herbert
was
not
getting
on
very
well
with
the
portrait
he
had
a
sudden
curiosity
to
see
it
are
really
too
simple
nor
said
olive
plaintively
you
see
the
only
trying
to
spread
out
the
sittings
so
as
to
have
you
come
there
i
dare
say
he
can
paint
as
well
as
the
present
eleanor
flushed
hotly
no
deception
about
his
limitations
i
am
almost
sorry
i
matthew
heart
leaped
exultant
did
let
his
gifts
rust
he
said
magnanimously
i
dare
say
his
old
talent
will
come
back
after
a
little
practice
he
had
a
fine
in
the
old
his
magnanimity
seemed
to
please
both
ladies
especially
olive
and
the
discussion
wound
up
suddenly
in
a
congruity
as
unexpected
as
any
of
her
arguments
were
great
chums
then
you
she
asked
he
was
my
cicerone
in
artistic
society
i
might
almost
say
in
civilized
society
i
owe
him
a
good
he
had
no
shame
in
hinting
at
his
humble
origin
to
these
two
unconventional
gentlewomen
is
his
studio
he
asked
they
told
him
but
miss

seemed
to
be
suddenly
uneasy

thought
his
hostesses
might
want
to
dress
elaborately
for
some
or
the

he
tore
himself
away
and
jumping
into
a
hansom
drove
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
to
studio

wearily

leaned
her

upon

much
for
you
you
look
tired

wish
i
was
really

of

soon
be

stay
for
a
few
things
yet
we
promised
wyndwood
reminded
her
sweetly
the
dance
at
lady
and
the
reception
of
olive
interrupted
her
with
a
burst
of
laughter
that
sounded
hysterical
to
her
anxious
ears
a
mad
bad
world
but
there
are
lady
lie
down
there
convents
for
unbelievers
nor
an
oversight
get
me
into
a
nunnery
but
i
should
be
suspected
of
piety
the
hospitals
are
overrun
they
are
as
impossible
as
ramsgate
and
your
nurse
is
suspected
of
being
a
heroine
when
will
people
understand
that
altruism
is
a
passion
and
that
nobody
wants
to
be
patted
on
the
back
for
gratifying
instinct
when
i
did
that
hard
in
the
dublin
hospital
but
that
was
before
i
knew
you
dear
half
my
family
thought
me
mad
and
the
other
half
a
saint
but
i
was
only
incapable
nor
dearest
i
dress
ugly
wounds
as
if
i
feeling
the
pain
of
them
no
a
failure
nothing
for
it
save
marriage
said
wyndwood
softly
laying
her
cheek
to
her
olive
moved
her
head
away
shuddering
violently
breed

she
rose
to
her
feet
and
stretched
her
arms
are
happy
you
roy
she
leaned
down
and
pulled
the
jaws
apart
and
sleeping
sleeping
and
eating
why
evolution
stop
with
you
instead
of
going
further
and
faring
worse
but
still
there
are
those
birds
roy
and
on
our
side

eleanor
wyndwood
says
which
art
is
it
going
to
be

what

that

eleanor
answered
deprecatingly

with
a
passionate

set
her
beautiful
bosom

do
you
misjudge

dearest
going
to
matthew
strang
had
rung
several
times
before
he
could
gain
admittance
to
his
studio
herbert
appeared
in
his
grinning
and
yawning
for
tat
he
said
awfully
glad
you
came
old
man
i
was
just
dreaming
of
you
by
jove
it
hot
when
herbert
said
man
in
his
caressing
voice
matthew
became
as
clay
in
the
hands
of
the
potter
it
seemed
so
good
to
have
the
friendship
of
this
sunny
being
he
answered
affectionately
that
it
hot
seen
this
den
before
said
herbert
so
swell
as
yours
but
then
hard
matthew
smiled
incredulously
for
the
studio
was
charming
doing
a
portrait
of
wyndwood
i
told
you
was
there
this
did
you
see
her
friend
miss
regan
is
always
know
she
a
jolly
little
girl
very
odd
said
matthew
you
philistine
the
most
amusing
girl
in
london
and
so
unaffected
you
can
say
anything
to
her
talk
about
anything
no
beastly
prudishness
what
i
like
in
a
woman
the
other
day
she
was
complaining
gravely
that
a
woman
be
a
burglar
because
it
would
land
her
in
compromising
situations
therefore
there
never
could
be
thorough
equality
of
the
sexes
she
maintained
it
quaint
she
sits
here
smoking
cigarettes
while
i
paint
that
saintly
friend
of
hers
and
all
the
while
rattles
on
in
the
most
delightful
fashion
what
a
flow
of
spirits
and
by
jove
the
clever
biting
things
she
says
make
your
hair
curl
not
in
it
with
her
though
i
try
hard
i
draw
her
out
to
talk
about
her
relations
better
than
thackeray
no
end
of
a
swell
you
disgustingly
rich
in
short
be
intolerable
if
she
herself
what
an
enviable
lot
all
the
beauty
bullion
blue
blood
and
brilliancy
no
wonder
they
say
she
had
an
eccentric
dad
which
accounts
for
her
a
man
who
wasted
one
of
his
fortunes
on
socialistic
experiments
but
she
knows
better
than
that
eccentricity
in
the
parent
is
epigram
in
the
is
an
epigram
said
matthew
laughing
and
considerably
relieved
by
this
outburst
on
his
part
parents
were
not
you
see
any
eccentricity
in
the
poor
old
trying
to
make
an
artist
out
of
me
that
portrait
asked
matthew
amused
it
is
you
duffer
staring
you
in
the
face
on
the
easel
all
the
time
say
you
recognize
it
please
that
i
know
who
it
is
began
matthew
laughing
ghastly
old
man
it
but
that
girl
distracts
me
with
her
made
you
attempt
it
asked
matthew
candidly
wanted
to
hear
her
matthew
felt
a
great
wave
of
affection
for
his
cousin
why
you
paint
sit
i
had
to
ask
her
friend
knowing
accompany
her
but
half
sorry
i
undertook
it
certainly
not
doing
her
justice
there
was
still
plenty
of
light
he
took
up
the
brush
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
sweetly
spiritual
face
gleamed
unmistakably
upon
the
canvas
herbert
watched
with
admiration
those
sure
swift
strokes
behind
which
lay
so
arduous
a
training
so
irrepressible
an
instinct
seem
to
have
her
face
by
heart
he
said
at
last
with
a
suspicious
twinkle
let
me
interrupt
and
lighting
a
cigarette
he
threw
himself
on
a
lounge
in
an
attitude
that
curiously
recalled
old
times
to
the
painter
matthew
strang
painted
on
lovingly
till
he
could
no
longer
see
his
palette
then
herbert
took
him
to
his
new
club
the
epicurean
and
gave
him
a
delightful
dinner
for
his
pains
and
over
the
kümmel
and
the
coffee
borrowed
a
hundred
pounds
from
him
so
as
not
to
sell
out
a
stock
that
was
depreciated
for
the
moment
chapter
v
a
celebrity
at
home
herbert
strang
had
gone
down
to
devonshire
to
finish
his
portrait
of
wyndwood
whose
dress
was
still
unrecognizable
and
who
was
so
agreeably
surprised
by
the
face
that
she
graciously
consented
to
continue
the
sittings
at
the
matthew
had
arranged
to
join
him
on
the
excellent
pretext
of
keeping
his
old
friend
company
but
before
he
left
town
for
his
holiday
conscience
began
working
hard
ominously
presageful
of
the
complications
that
might
spring
up
in
the
solitudes
of
hills
and
waters
the
inner
voice
whispered
strenuously
to
him
to
profit
by
absence
to
fight
down
his
impossible
passion
not
intensify
it
unendurably
by
following
in
her
train
thoughts
of
his
wife
began
to
haunt
him
thoughts
which
while
he
was
only
an
absentee
husband
had
been
but
pale
shadows
of
remorse
dogging
his
few
unoccupied
moments
but
which
now
that
another
woman
had
at
last
enthroned
herself
in
the
vacant
temple
of
his
soul
assumed
shapes
more
solid
and
insistent
home
plucked
at
his
heart
subtly
transformed
to
something
more
than
an
unpleasant
recollection
in
a
spasm
of
compunction
and
foreboding
he
resolved
to
pay
a
visit
to
his
wife
to
strengthen
himself
against
temptation
the
idea
once
conceived
drove
him
to
instant
execution
ere
the
train
had
drawn
up
at
camden
town
he
had
determined
to
elude
temptation
altogether
by
accompanying
his
own
family
on
its
annual
jaunt
the
visit
began
inauspiciously
when
he
had
passed
the
turreted
church
which
was
the
one
picturesque
object
on
the
road
from
the
station
he
was
back
in
the
old
familiar
mesh
of
gray
streets
any
one
like
any
other
with
rows
of
shabby
houses
exactly
alike
broken
at
corners
by
and
the
august
afternoon
was
depressed
with
misty
sputtering
rain
a
few
carts
rattled
forlornly
down
the
drab
avenues
of
apathetic
houses
a
diminutive
wheezed
a
lively
air
never
had
his
street
seemed
so
hopeless
his
ardor
grew
chill
he
paused
before
the
door
of
the
little
studio
where
he
had
painted
his
first
success
the
discolored
wood
set
in
the
blankness
of
a
long
brick
wall
was
scrawled
over
with
chalk
inscriptions
and
sketches
by
the
urchins
of
the
neighborhood
the
house
was
round
the
corner
and
after
a
melancholy
moment
he
walked
listlessly
towards
the
front
gate
swung
it
on
its
creaking
hinges
and
mounted
the
chipped
stone
steps
washed
by
the
drippings
of
rain
there
was
a
new
face
heavy
and
smudged
under
the
cap
of
the
who
opened
the
door
and
as
he
entered
the
narrow
hall
the
sickly
smell
of
boiled
cabbage
saluted
his
nostrils
and
justified
him
to
himself
but
he
was
grimly
embarrassed
at
having
to
explain
himself
to
the
girl
your
mistress
in
he
asked
sir
will
you
wait
in
the
sir
what
name
sir
he
felt
mortified
and
a
whit
ashamed
the
ignorance
was
an
unconscious
rebuke
that
counterbalanced
the
boiled
cabbage
tell
her
matthew
he
said
flushing
and
the
cap
stuck
on
askew
for
the
edification
of
unexpected
company
disappeared
down
the
kitchen
stairs
he
would
have
liked
to
brush
majestically
past
her
but
delicacy
prevented
so
abrupt
an
intrusion
upon
his
wife
in
the
recesses
of
domesticity
his
coming
was
already
sufficient
surprise
a
few
hours
ago
he
himself
had
not
foreseen
that
a
swamping
wave
of
moral
emotion
would
sweep
him
homeward
he
walked
about
the
room
morbidly
fascinated
by
the
flashy
vases
with
the
shepherds
and
wondering
what
rosina
would
say
if
he
made
away
with
them
as
decency
demanded
to
his
bitter
amusement
he
heard
her
voice
from
the
passage
remonstrating
with
billy
in
a
very
audible
whisper
for
the
indiscretion
in
admitting
to
the
a
stranger
who
might
do
havoc
among
her
cherished
possessions
knows
what
he
may
not
pocket
she
grumbled
uneasily
as
she
approached
the
door
all
right
rosina
he
called
out
coming
into
the
passage
only
ejaculated
matthew
strang
angrily
putting
her
hand
to
her
heart
a
turn
you
gave
me
so
the
matthews
i
really
do
wish
you
come
sneaking
in
and
prying
and
ferreting
and
frightening
a
body
out
of
her
she
stood
there
no
more
pleasing
than
the
vases
the
features
that
had
once
threatened
to
be
pretty
sharpened
shrewishly
though
the
figure
had
grown
plumper
except
where
the
breasts
had
fallen
she
did
not
look
her
youth
the
face
was
weary
the
pale
blue
eyes
had
lost
their
softness
she
had
hastily
donned
a
cheap
black
cashmere
dress
trimmed
with
jet
the
painter
was
glad
the
usual
effusion
of
affection
was
wanting
notwithstanding
the
pitch
of
reaction
to
which
he
was
wrought
up
all
his
being
shrank
from
the
desecrating
embrace
of
the
woman
he
did
not
love
nevertheless
he
was
conscious
of
an
undercurrent
of
astonishment
longer
intervals
than
this
last
had
parted
them
yet
she
had
never
failed
to
exhibit
amorous
emotion
even
though
it
took
the
shape
of
jealous
reproach
this
afternoon
there
was
a
suggestion
of
resentment
in
her
greeting
for
the
first
time
he
felt
unwelcome
he
was
puzzled
albeit
relieved
but
the
secret
of
her
mood
did
not
leak
out
yet
and
in
the
meantime
there
was
billy
sulkily
awaiting
his
famous
recognition
the
young
man
looked
whiter
and
thinner
than
on
last
visit
to
the
house
glad
be
to
come
for
a
holiday
with
me
thought
the
painter
with
a
pang
of
joyful
repentance
to
live
in
london
at
all
all
go
down
to
some
pretty
little
village
where
i
can
paint
if
necessary
and
stay
till
the
the
cripple
churlishly
took
the
hand
which
his
brother
extended
his
palm
burned
right
billy
questioned
matthew
cheerfully
matter
how
i
am
snapped
the
younger
man
months
since
been
nigh
rosina
turned
upon
billy
you
take
my
part
i
can
speak
for
myself
you
expect
to
see
your
brother
in
the
summer
when
all
the
fashionable
folks
come
up
to
london
to
be
billy
murmured
something
inarticulate
and
looked
doggedly
at
matthew
leaning
on
his
crutch
suppose
i
must
ask
you
to
walk
in
and
take
a
chair
since
you
are
such
a
stranger
said
matthew
strang
her
husband
meekly
retreated
into
the
and
sat
down
with
his
back
to
the
vases
that
adorned
the
but
now
a
new
horror
caught
his
eye
nothing
less
than
a
framed
oleograph
of
which
had
found
its
way
into
the
house
in
the
days
when
its
wide
popularity
still
gave
him
a
certain
interest
in
it
not
far
removed
from
pride
on
his
soul
tensely
strung
by
hand
for
the
high
notes
of
imagination
this
cheap
domesticity
now
jarred
abominably
the
picture
glared
at
him
it
loomed
suddenly
symbolic
it
was
representative
of
rosina
and
her
influence
this
was
her
height
of
poetry
the
top
measure
of
her
soul
the
mother
carrying
the
little
girl
who
carried
the
doll
the
work
he
wanted
to
do
nay
the
work
he
had
always
wanted
to
do
that
was
what
eleanor
stood
for
the
rare
the
fine
the
ethereal
years
of
insincere
work
had
blunted
and
torpified
him
eleanor
had
recreated
his
soul
had
given
him
freshness
of
feeling
and
something
of
the
early
ardor
of
aspiration
this
passed
through
his
mind
before
billy
had
stumped
in
and
taken
a
chair
opposite
him
rosina
remained
standing
at
the
open
door
in
an
attitude
expressive
of
household
duties
plucking
at
her
skirts
the
painter
shifted
nervously
on
his
chair
there
was
a
dead
silence
it
permitted
the
tootling
of
a
tin
whistle
to
become
audible
and
gave
the
painter
the
happy
thought
of
asking
after
the
children
at
school
replied
rosina
ungraciously
the
second
girl
in
her
class
and
could
be
top
if
she
so
davie
you
hear
for
yourself
only
too
quiet
as
a
rule
but
since
you
brought
him
that
whistle
been
unbearable
the
only
thing
that
rouses
him
it
was
stopped
up
for
a
fortnight
and
he
went
about
like
a
little
ghost
till
billy
put
it
right
if
he
only
had
a
notion
of
music
billy
tried
to
teach
him
to
play
on
it
but
got
no
head
for
anything
there
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
squeal
such
a
baby
yet
said
her
husband
deprecatingly
then
the
conversation
languished
again
and
lugubrious
whistle
held
the
field
billy
drew
vague
designs
on
the
carpet
with
his
crutch
matthew
fidgeted
and
at
last
got
up
he
was
meditating
how
to
turn
the
conversation
into
a
tenderer
channel
and
broach
the
holiday
in
common
rosina
maintained
her
inconclusive
attitude
in
the
doorway
still
got
those
vases
matthew
said
there
being
no
other
thought
in
the
way
this
thought
escaped
she
rejoined
i
wonder
at
your
asking
any
day
may
see
the
end
of
them
servants
are
growing
that
careless
even
as
it
is
they
only
dust
their
outsides
if
i
wash
them

in
a
she
walked
to
the
and
ran
her
forefinger
down
one
of
them
the
finger
grew
black
as
with
anger
her
brow
darkened
amy
is
worse
than
jane
she
cried
harshly
stand
any
more
of
her
nonsense
do
you
know
what
she
did
last
week
here
she
walked
back
to
the
door
and
shut
it
tightly
lest
her
words
should
reach
the
kitchen
washed
the
colored
things
in
the
same
water
as
the
whites
and
then
after
the
wash
i
missed
a
pair
of
red
socks
and
i
hunted
high
and
low
for
them
and
made
a
fuss
the
next
day
billy
found
them
mysteriously
mixed
up
with
his
flannels
i
am
convinced
she
stole
them
not
knowing
she
had
a
sharp
eye
to
deal
with
i
know
worry
me
into
the
grave
these
servants
this
morning
i
particularly
said
to
her
you
dusted
the
and
she
said
bold
as
brass
and
this
is
what
she
calls
she
held
up
her
gloomy
forefinger
then
lowering
her
voice
as
if
it
might
penetrate
even
through
the
closed
door
she
hissed
menacingly
at
the
brothers
give
her
a
piece
of
my
mind
that
i
will
if
she
know
when
got
a
good
place
the
great
hulking
brute
she
shall
pack
herself
off
this
very
afternoon
a
charwoman
i
give
her
every
monday
to
help
her
two
shillings
i
have
to
pay
and
her
beer
money
to
say
nothing
of
the
work
i
do
with
my
own
hands
often
and
often
i
make
the
beds
myself
for
there
a
girl
in
creation
you
can
trust
to
shake
out
the
bedding
they
leave
it
all
lumpy
and
what
is
the
reward
for
all
my
kindness
i
hate
them
all
i
wish
their
necks
were
wish
they
were
said
billy
impatiently
sick
of
hearing
about
rosina
turned
upon
him
again
who
asks
you
to
stay
here
sure
sick
of
hearing
you
grumbling
and
whining
about
the
eyes
blazed
a
red
spot
burned
in
each
white
cheek
you
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
rosina
interposed
matthew
gently
dare
say
amy
has
let
the
fire
go
out
she
snapped
the
bell
nearest
matthew
rang
the
bell
and
amy
appeared
you
make
some
tea
amy
rosina
inquired
in
sweet
seductive
accents
husband
has
just
come
from
abroad
she
explained
deferentially
and
apologetically
we
be
wanting
any
more
at
have
tea
a
little
earlier
and
you
can
keep
the
water
hot
for
miss
amy
disappeared
you
see
the
smudge
on
her
cheek
asked
rosina
despairingly
even
dust
her
while
rosina
was
speaking
her
husband
fretted
under
her
conversation
the
awkward
silence
that
ensued
when
she
ceased
made
him
wish
she
would
go
on
talking
is
business
she
asked
finding
him
dumb
he
suppressed
a
grimace
fair
you
know
always
got
as
much
to
do
as
i
care
know
what
been
thinking
rosina
replied
in
a
softened
and
more
confidential
tone
ought
to
make
enough
to
be
able
to
retire
one
day
why
should
you
always
live
away
from
me
as
bad
as
marrying
a
drummer
at
no
one
a
commercial
traveller
they
call
them
in
england
and
his
wife
tells
me
the
house
with
the
striped
linen
blinds
she
see
him
half
a
dozen
times
a
year
and
getting
almost
as
scarce
particularly
this
she
dropped
into
a
chair
finally
dismissing
her
tentative
attitude
this
seemed
a
favorable
opening
at
last
so
her
husband
plunged
into
it
been
out
of
town
yet
he
began
rosina
bounded
wrathfully
from
her
chair
i
knew
that
that
was
what
you
came
to
spy
out
it
enough
that
left
your
brother
here
to
be
a
spy
on
all
my
comings
and
goings
rather
me
that
ought
to
be
setting
a
spy
on
you
god
knows
what
with
your
studios
and
your
models
and
your
fashionable
women
well
there
he
is
to
witness
anyhow
we
have
our
fortnight
at
the
we
billy
billy
nodded
your
own
brother
to
witness
we
went
last
month
and
all
to
save
you
money
though
i
know
you
think
making
a
stocking
they
charged
us
so
much
last
year
for
lodgings
at
margate
in
august
that
i
made
up
my
mind
i
be
swindled
any
more
and
so
we
went
in
july
and
we
did
save
no
use
my
denying
it
with
that
spy
of
yours
ever
at
my
tail
but
had
to
spend
twice
as
much
in
london
with
everything
gone
up
in
price
asking
a
shilling
a
peck
for
peas
you
can
go
round
and
ask
delton
the
if
you
believe
me
enough
to
ruin
anybody
and
then
there
was
the
rise
in
coals
in
the
spring
on
account
of
the
strike
something
frightful
and
such
a
lot
of
slag
and
then
poor
clara
has
been
so
poorly
i
sent
for
the
doctor
once
and
then
he
would
keep
on
coming
to
see
her
every
day
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
him
and
that
brother
of
yours
the
spunk
to
tell
him
straight
out
not
to
come
any
more
goodness
knows
what
his
bill
has
run
up
to
simply
these
doctors
so
there
if
you
think
caught
me
out
coming
down
on
me
like
a
detective
in
my
week
nicely
mistaken
slyboots
what
are
you
glaring
at
me
for
looking
for
the
brown
have
given
myself
a
coat
of
paint
if
i
had
known
you
were
coming
though
i
pretend
to
be
so
clever
at
it
as
you
or
your
fine
ladies
either
for
the
matter
of
as
rosina
stood
over
him
breathlessly
pouring
forth
her
impassioned
defence
of
the
position
she
took
up
in
financial
matters
matthew
strang
felt
he
understood
why
men
sometimes
kill
women
he
had
long
since
given
up
attempting
to
make
her
understand
that
her
thoughts
were
not
his
thoughts
that
despite
his
hard
training
in
the
value
of
money
details
of
expenditure
had
ceased
to
occupy
his
consciousness
the
moment
the
pinch
of
need
was
become
a
thing
of
the
past
he
was
inured
to
her
financial
apologetics
her
tedious
justifications
of
what
he
in
his
ignorance
that
she
was
indeed
hoarding
money
secretly
and
like
all
women
saving
on
her
never
called
into
question
he
had
steeled
himself
to
a
simulation
of
attention
when
she
elaborately
accounted
for
every
farthing
he
had
given
her
and
habituated
to
money
perpetually
passing
from
his
hands
he
had
never
even
reflected
that
her
style
of
living
could
not
possibly
exhaust
the
sums
with
which
he
supplemented
her
own
income
to
his
heedless
mind
a
growing
family
vaguely
explained
everything
but
the
prosaic
minutiæ
though
painfully
familiar
set
up
an
inward
fume
that
intensified
by
her
misconstruction
of
his
visit
and
by
her
digs
at
billy
approached
insanity
he
controlled
himself
with
a
great
effort
is
you
that
are
mistaken
rosina
he
rejoined
clinching
his
palms
came
merely
to
propose
that
you
should
take
your
holiday
now
i
thought
we
might
go
somewhere
then
a
bit
too
late
she
replied
with
no
diminution
of
come
over
you
that
you
want
my
company
all
of
a
sudden
i
thought
you
spare
me
a
week
ever
i
reckon
the
truth
is
that
got
i
told
you
my
hands
were
full
he
said
losing
his
no
reason
why
you
should
waste
money
on
me
i
go
twice
to
the
want
you
to
go
twice
i
know
you
had
explained
to
you
why
i
went
she
retorted
hotly
wanted
three
guineas
last
year
for
a
and
two
poky
bedrooms
and
there
was
no
key
to
the
chiffonier
and
sure
the
landlady
nibbled
at
our
i
would
have
gladly
let
you
have
a
little
extra
if
you
wanted
to
go
in
much
rather
you
spent
the
money
on
the
children
clara
wears
out
her
shoes
frightfully
the
expense
turns
my
hair
you
care
to
go
with
me
it
would
be
sinful
extravagance
to
go
twice
give
me
the
money
if
so
anxious
to
get
rid
of
be
reasonable
rosina
i
dare
say
the
children
will
enjoy
another
week
of
children
much
you
care
about
the
children
you
asked
to
see
davie
yet
and
as
for
clara
scornful
accents
dried
up
suddenly
her
acute
ear
had
caught
the
gentle
clatter
of
the
mounting
tray
she
opened
the
door
for
amy
sure
the
water
was
boiling
she
inquired
pleasantly
the
mistress
produced
a
little
key
from
her
bosom
will
find
a
cake
in
the
cupboard
under
the
sideboard
and
bring
up
the
plates
the
little
ones
when
the
tea
was
duly
served
rosina
resumed
as
for
clara
i
even
write
to
you
she
had
been
ailing
i
knew
you
took
so
little
interest
in
the
poor
child
she
might
die
and
be
buried
for
all
know
if
you
tell
me
he
said
sulkily
stung
by
the
germ
of
truth
in
her
words
you
let
davie
come
up
to
me
you
ought
to
have
sent
him
up
as
soon
as
you
knew
i
was
rosina
threw
open
the
door
again
with
a
jerk
and
leaned
over
the
kitchen
stairs
she
bawled
that
dreadful
noise
and
come
up
at
once
do
you
hear
your
father
is
dying
to
see
the
painter
bit
his
lips
an
irrelevant
memory
rang
in
his
brain
with
a
russian
accent
do
not
like
this
word
the
face
of
eleanor
wyndwood
swam
up
on
the
air
the
patter
of
feet
was
heard
toddling
up
the
stairs
the
child
stumbled
shyly
into
the
room
the
tin
whistle
clasped
distrustfully
to
his
breast
a
pathetic
anæmic
little
figure
with
flaxen
curls
and
big
gray
eyes
that
easily
brimmed
over
with
tears
he
wore
serge
knickerbockers
and
the
rest
of
him
aped
the
sailor
picturesquely
enough
the
child
paused
near
the
door
clutching
his
skirt
way
my
little
man
said
matthew
smiling
encouragingly
from
the
green
sofa
that
sprawled
across
the
centre
of
the
room
to
your
to
the
gentleman
dear
said
rosina
with
withering
sarcasm
but
the
boy
hung
back
clutching
her
skirt
and
his
whistle
tighter
be
afraid
davie
i
take
your
whistle
from
you
you
remember
i
gave
it
you
he
held
up
a
piece
of
cake
thus
adjured
and
enticed
davie
moved
cautiously
forward
waves
of
returning
recollection
agitating
the
wee
wan
face
a
lump
swelled
in
the
throat
as
he
surveyed
the
weakling
the
poor
child
suddenly
appeared
to
him
the
for
an
unholy
union
life
had
taught
him
from
what
fount
of
sacred
love
children
should
spring
while
he
was
hoisting
the
child
on
his
knee
responsive
to
that
strong
appeal
of
feeble
creatures
but
with
no
specific
stirrings
of
paternity
davie
wistfully
held
up
his
disengaged
hand
for
the
cake
which
he
grabbed
as
soon
as
it
came
within
range
of
his
little
arm
his
mouth
was
too
preoccupied
with
cake
to
return
his
kiss
to
which
he
submitted
passively
the
painter
laid
his
hand
tenderly
on
the
flaxen
hair
you
enjoy
yourself
at
margate
davie
rosina
uttered
an
exclamation
of
disgust
i
never
you
be
next
perhaps
you
think
billy
and
me
are
in
a
conspiracy
that
gained
over
your
spy
better
go
so
as
not
to
influence
the
and
turning
on
her
heel
she
marched
haughtily
kitchenwards
matthew
sighed
wearily
the
matter
with
her
billy
he
asked
ask
me
been
as
cross
as
two
sticks
ever
since
had
new
curtains
at
no
opposite
and
the
weather
has
been
so
muggy
and
your
coming
has
upset
she
seems
to
have
turned
against
you
too
you
used
to
get
on
so
well
so
difficult
to
live
with
replied
billy
fretfully
quarrelsome
and
is
she
discontented
about
matthew
asked
uneasily
got
plenty
of
it
the
money
replied
billy
morosely
lucky
is
rosina
she
has
money
of
her
own
do
you
know
her
little
american
property
has
gone
up
a
good
deal
lately
her
income
is
nearer
nine
hundred
than
eight
hundred
murmured
his
brother
dimly
interested
old
coble
wrote
to
her
telling
her
things
were
looking
up
and
he
was
right
no
it
rosina
got
cause
of
complaint
about
money
matters
she
like
me
she
dependent
on
you
for
every
his
words
rang
bitterly
resentfully
surely
you
mind
taking
money
from
me
billy
he
said
with
infinite
gentleness
why
i
mind
taking
money
from
a
stranger
stranger
naught
else
do
you
think
i
know
of
your
your
gaddings
about
to
parties
and
banquets
because
rosina
read
the
papers
you
think
ignorant
too
got
a
heap
of
things
about
you
in
my
study
all
cut
out
and
pasted
in
books
i
tell
rosina
because
it
would
only
make
her
discontented
but
it
riles
me
i
tell
you
straight
to
be
left
here
leading
this
wretched
lonesome
life
why
i
live
with
you
could
live
with
me
if
you
liked
billy
but
you
see
be
just
as
wretched
and
lonesome
all
day
i
should
be
at
work
and
when
i
went
out
you
accompany
me
i
foist
my
relatives
on
the
people
who
invite
me
out
they
only
want
and
that
only
as
a
curiosity
he
added
with
a
bitter
perception
of
how
extrinsic
he
really
was
to
the
charmed
circles
of
society
of
how
little
affinity
there
was
between
him
and
the
bulk
of
those
who
gushed
over
his
art
if
you
would
only
help
me
to
get
my
work
published
make
a
fuss
over
me
too
but
never
moved
your
little
finger
to
help
got
wilson
and
butler
to
read
some
of
your
mss
i
do
any
more
it
my
fault
if
they
think
your
work
good
i
believe
they
ever
saw
it
you
only
said
they
did
to
pacify
billy
cried
matthew
in
shocked
reproach
even
if
they
did
said
billy
tetchily
not
infallible
prejudiced
they
think
two
brothers
both
be
clever
sure
my
stories
are
as
good
as
anything
that
appears
in
their
magazines
and
a
damned
sight
better
but
there
are
any
amount
of
other
editors
that
you
come
across
for
seen
your
name
printed
with
theirs
in
the
lists
of
guests
at
public
dinners
but
you
go
your
own
way
and
never
spare
a
thought
for
me
eating
my
heart
out
here
i
come
in
handy
to
keep
your
wife
company
and
to
prevent
her
feeling
deserted
and
you
think
about
all
good
his
white
face
was
worked
up
to
a
flush
of
anger
he
had
the
common
delusion
of
the
unsuccessful
that
the
successful
in
any
department
can
pull
the
ropes
in
every
other
nor
could
he
understand
that
matthew
disliked
approaching
people
and
people
disliked
being
approached
good
for
be
said
matthew
soothingly
your
work
is
really
it
will
come
to
the
front
in
the
he
shrank
from
adding
that
he
did
not
think
it
even
it
was
no
use
making
the
boy
more
miserable
but
i
run
a
cripple
billy
burst
forth
passionately
knows
whether
i
shall
live
to
see
the
end
of
the
perhaps
give
me
a
stone
when
dead
but
the
good
of
to
me
you
have
everything
that
makes
life
worth
living
you
have
love
you
have
a
wife
whenever
you
choose
to
come
you
have
money
and
heaps
of
it
all
earned
by
the
sweat
of
your
own
brow
you
have
fame
your
name
is
in
all
the
papers
you
have
fashionable
folk
courting
and
caressing
you
i
dare
say
some
lady
fixed
that
rose
so
beautifully
in
your
i
can
smell
her
white
fingers
all
roses
and
sunshine
for
you
but
you
take
jolly
good
care
to
keep
to
the
imbittered
words
carried
no
sting
to
the
breast
but
he
was
sick
at
heart
as
he
replied
gently
really
mean
what
saying
billy
you
know
offered
to
defray
the
cost
of
publication
of
field
and
if
only
let
but
making
me
more
of
a
drag
on
you
besides
you
told
me
only
the
rotten
houses
that
publish
novels
at
the
expense
and
that
the
critics
look
askance
on
them
but
if
i
could
earn
enough
on
my
short
stories
to
pay
for
a
book
chance
his
voice
took
on
a
maundering
pitiful
intonation
sure
worked
hard
enough
toiling
at
my
desk
and
denying
myself
every
pleasure
in
life
you
say
i
keep
sober
now
i
never
go
beyond
one
glass
of
ale
at
very
good
billy
been
good
for
a
long
echoed
billy
in
the
same
testy
lachrymose
accents
the
good
of
being
good
i
wish
i
was
dead
why
you
let
me
drink
my
fits
back
again
his
breast
heaved
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
sobs
the
painter
sat
in
mute
misery
a
shriek
from
the
whistle
destroyed
the
intolerable
situation
davie
having
finished
munching
his
cake
had
his
mouth
free
again
for
musical
operations
your
fingers
over
the
holes
davie
said
his
father
it
play
no
use
put
in
billy
moodily
tried
to
teach
move
my
fingers
davie
and
you
shall
blow
and
play
a
pretty
tune
together
no
be
alarmed
not
taking
the
whistle
away
only
putting
my
fingers
on

you
shall
hold
the
end
fast
in
your
the
child
blew
spasmodically
his
father
mechanically
played
the
first
tune
that
came
into
his
fingers
a
gleam
of
excited
interest
leaped
into
the
eyes
as
he
heard
the
notes
varying
mysteriously
in
a
rough
jingle
but
the
painter
broke
off
suddenly
he
realized
that
he
was
playing
sweet
it
was
too
ghastly
more
panted
davie
imperatively
matthew
strang
obediently
started
doodle
and
had
to
grant
two
encores
before
the
juvenile
tyrant
was
robbed
of
breath
and
desire
your
name
my
little
man
he
asked
thoughtlessly
to
make
conversation
what
and
how
old
are
you
nearly
four
replied
davie
adding
in
a
burst
of
new
confidence
i
come
to
my
fourf
birfday
mummy
says
me
a
penny
every
week
all
to
said
the
painter
with
a
sad
smile
whole
penny
davie
shook
his
head
in
vehement
affirmation
and
i
am
what
i
shall
buy
mummy
my
firth
penny
appleth
or
a
a
thrill
shot
down
the
spine
the
poor
sickly
infant
appeared
suddenly
lovable
to
him
for
the
first
time
too
he
realized
the
child
as
an
independent
entity
with
thoughts
of
its
own
at
work
in
the
queer
little
brain
whatever
the
quality
of
this
little
brain
heart
was
sound
enough
and
this
heart
was
evidently
entirely
given
to
his
mother
the
momentary
prick
of
irrational
jealousy
that
the
discovery
caused
the
father
was
forgotten
in
softer
feelings
his
conception
of
the
mother
rose
with
his
conception
of
the
child
she
was
the
other
side
of
the
relation
and
there
must
be
something
beautiful
in
her
to
correspond
with
the
beauty
of
her
sentiment
the
oleograph
of
caught
his
eye
again
he
saw
how
insincerely
he
had
painted
it
from
a
mere
intellectual
idea
unfelt
unrealized
but
he
saw
also
the
secret
of
its
popularity
each
observer
contributing
the
emotion
the
painter
had
not
felt
his
eye
dwelt
upon
it
more
tolerantly
me
davie
he
said
you
shall
have
a
penny
now
to
buy
mummy
a
davie
readily
put
up
his
lips
to
clinch
the
bargain
and
his
father
gave
him
the
coin
the
boy
regarded
it
wistfully
do
you
say
billy
put
in
more
amiably
you
said
davie
you
da
prompted
billy
wound
up
davie
triumphantly
no
now
he
added
dubiously
was
a
lot
at
be
a
davie
said
his
father
cheerily
you
like
to
have
this
beautiful
flower
this
rose
in
my
for
your
penny
to
give
to
mummy
i
wants
it
said
davie
clutching
greedily
for
it
or
all
the
lovely
pink
leaves
will
fall
out
and
you
must
give
me
your
penny
you
davie
with
a
perplexed
air
vaguely
conscious
of
commercial
transactions
too
complicated
for
his
intellect
hesitatingly
retendered
the
penny
and
receiving
the
rose
was
set
down
on
the
carpet
he
ran
eagerly
to
the
door
blowing
one
disconsolate
irrelevant
blast
on
the
whistle
and
then
the
brothers
heard
him
tumble
down
the
stairs
with
three
thuds
followed
by
shrill
ululations
they
ran
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
but
rosina
had
already
rushed
forth
to
pick
up
her
child
and
her
soothing
prattle
varied
by
scolding
for
his
careless
hurry
made
a
duet
with
his
howls
did
you
get
that
flower
from
crumpled
it
all
to
she
extracted
it
from
the
fingers
that
had
closed
upon
it
tenaciously
when
the
fall
commenced
the
him
what
i
calls
daddy
for
you
him
he
can
keep
it
howls
recommenced
matthew
heart
contracted
he
went
down
the
stairs
to
where
rosina
ministered
to
her
bruised
offspring
send
you
the
flower
rosina
he
said
gently
a
gift
from
the
is
it
then
than
his
father
all
i
can
say
thank
you
my
poor
darling
thank
you
dry
your
little
eyes
and
mummy
shall
take
you
out
to
see
all
the
pretty
you
come
and
finish
your
tea
rosina
matthew
pleaded
busy
she
said
tartly
giving
clara
her
tea
just
come
home
from
her
bring
her
tea
then
she
can
talk
to
tell
her
here
i
dare
say
remember
you
she
generally
gets
something
out
of
he
bit
his
lips
to
keep
back
angry
speech
and
remounted
to
the
clara
came
close
upon
his
footsteps
and
ran
to
offer
her
lips
she
was
a
tall
child
of
seven
with
a
low
forehead
dark
hair
and
eyebrows
a
heavy
jaw
and
a
high
color
handsome
after
a
rather
gallic
fashion
the
painter
always
trod
gingerly
with
her
knowing
she
had
her
temper
rosina
lacking
the
clew
was
less
delicate
with
the
girl
whose
sullen
phases
irritated
her
immeasurably
this
afternoon
clara
was
conciliated
by
sixpence
and
chatted
amicably
with
her
father
about
her
lessons
presently
her
mother
came
up
too
with
davie
in
her
train
and
there
was
the
outward
spectacle
of
a
happy
family
group
united
at
tea
the
painter
was
emboldened
to
strengthen
an
idea
that
was
gradually
forming
in
his
mind
by
expressing
it
feels
very
lonely
down
in
this
part
of
the
town
he
began
timidly
what
must
i
feel
rosina
snapped
why
we
all
live
together
rosina
he
said
more
boldly
you
beginning
that
again
she
asked
sharply
come
and
live
here
will
you
know
it
is
you
know
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
move
to
your
neighborhood
told
you
a
thousand
times
you
afford
one
of
those
big
houses
it
would
be
ruinous
have
to
keep
a
staff
of
servants
to
match
and
things
would
be
coming
to
the
house
at
extravagant
prices
from
aristocratic
tradespeople
whereas
here
i
go
out
and
do
my
bit
of
marketing
and
pick
up
a
bargain
here
and
a
bargain
there
found
out
a
place
in
holloway
where
i
get
the
best
meat
a
penny
a
pound
cheaper
than
anywhere
in
camden
town
and
it
only
means
a
penny
tram
there
and
back
you
know
how
much
i
save
you
a
year
when
you
suspect
me
of
making
a
stocking
for
myself
out
of
my
allowance
and
even
if
you
can
afford
such
a
house
rather
give
me
the
money
and
let
me
put
it
by
for
the
he
made
a
despairing
gesture
could
get
a
small
house
he
said
could
work
harder
for
a
year
or
two
perhaps
i
could
get
a
few
more
rooms
added
to
my
studio
a
piece
of
ground
i
use
at
the
back
for
what
would
be
the
use
of
my
living
with
you
inquired
rosina
brutally
want
me
any
more
i
dare
say
you
could
come
home
at
night
now
if
you
wanted
said
her
husband
flushing
my
dear
take
davie
out
and
buy
him
some
candy
this
penny
is
really
and
the
joyous
children
disappeared
orphans
said
rosina
just
as
well
there
be
any
more
of
matthew
strang
was
startled
yet
not
quite
surprised
by
the
revelation
of
his
mood
she
had
never
before
so
openly
resented
or
dissented
from
the
situation
that
had
gradually
grown
up
one
of
those
strange
complex
undefined
situations
of
which
life
is
so
full
and
which
are
only
able
to
exist
by
virtue
of
not
being
put
into
words
he
stirred
the
dregs
of
his
tea
with
his
spoon
painfully
embarrassed
shall
talk
to
an
architect
i
know
he
said
at
last
ignoring
her
allusion
cost
be
much
and
it
be
all
paid
off
at
once
besides
he
added
with
forced
playfulness
extra
hundred
dollars
a
year
of
yours
must
be
used
up
rosina
turned
eyes
of
flame
upon
the
unhappy
billy
knew
it
she
said
cuttingly
knew
you
were
here
to
spy
upon
me
so
you
have
sneaked
about
that
have
you
matthew
lost
his
temper
at
last
be
a
fool
rosina
he
said
roughly
you
think
i
care
a
pin
whether
you
spend
a
wretched
hundred
dollars
more
or
less
i
dare
say
you
would
rather
have
a
wife
that
would
bring
you
to
the
workhouse
they
had
the
bailiffs
in
at
no
only
yesterday
a
wife
there
that
would
just
suit
you
the
something
in
your
way
of
business
an
author
or
a
poet
and
a
tall
creature
who
sits
at
the
window
in
strange
long
gowns
without
stays
and
reads
books
to
him
and
never
goes
to
church
my
you
should
see
her
out
marketing
they
swindle
her
at
every
turn
she
know
a
horse
from
a
ham
sandwich
i
wonder
come
to
a
bad
end
you
should
see
the
dust
on
her
venetian
blinds
i
prophesied
the
crash
last
winter
ask
billy
if
i
they
took
in
their
coals
by
the
you
fancy
i
know
the
sort
of
woman
hankering
after
ever
since
my
davie
was
born
and
you
got
mixed
up
with
those
sort
of
creatures
been
sorry
you
married
me
oh
no
use
denying
it
you
want
a
fine
lady
that
would
scorn
to
soil
her
fingers
with
housework
and
expect
you
to
cover
with
diamonds
a
creature
that
would
faint
at
the
sight
of
a
but
you
were
glad
enough
to
marry
me
once
upon
a
time
when
you
a
dollar
to
your
name
they
say
a
fine
painter
and
who
made
you
a
fine
painter
who
took
you
abroad
and
supported
you
while
you
were
studying
they
think
a
fine
gentleman
and
who
made
you
a
fine
gentleman
oh
yes
i
know
not
one
of
your
fine
ladies
but
if
i
had
been
where
would
you
have
been
now
in
the
bankruptcy
court
perhaps
back
again
in
the
jail
from
which
i
dragged
matthew
crimsoned
furiously
billy
leaped
in
his
chair
how
dare
you
say
such
things
to
my
brother
he
cried
choking
with
rage
in
jail
indeed
her
talk
said
matthew
wearily
see
it
was
a
mistake
to
have
come
here
at
rosina
cast
a
glance
of
venomous
triumph
at
her
drooping
husband
the
jail
was
a
chance
shot
in
long
lonely
agonizing
watches
the
resentful
suspicion
had
germinated
and
grown
true
she
said
defiantly
him
deny
did
you
take
a
husband
from
jail
retorted
the
painter
with
a
flash
of
fire
know
it
i
was
tricked
and
bamboozled
and
i
had
a
heart
in
my
breast
then
not
a
stone
if
i
had
been
a
fine
lady
i
might
have
been
more
particular
to
examine
your
a
sense
of
guilt
damped
the
fire
the
jail
episode
was
not
the
only
thing
he
had
concealed
sorry
you
married
me
we
can
separate
he
murmured
we
separated
enough
do
you
mean
like
a
divorce
oh
no
not
for
this
child
so
that
you
may
marry
one
of
your
fine
ladies
perhaps
make
an
honest
woman
of
her
he
sprang
to
his
feet
thundering
the
image
of
eleanor
wyndwood
swept
involuntarily
before
him
and
he
felt
that
this
woman
had
profaned
it
she
flinched
before
the
cry
but
parodied
it
daringly
he
flung
from
the
room
billy
prodded
frantically
after
him
go
matt
go
never
come
back
the
piteous
appeal
sounded
like
a
prophecy
he
paused
in
the
hall
irresolute
rosina
laughed
hysterically
had
better
go
with
him
billy
if
so
frightened
and
good
riddance
to
the
pair
of
you
got
my
bread
and
butter
thank
god
my
children
starve
if
their
father
desert
me
go
billy
he
said
hoarsely
shaking
off
the
clutch
breathe
here
come
with
me
write
to
me
do
what
you
he
opened
the
and
closed
it
behind
him
and
dashed
against
his
children
coming
back
through
the
gate
with
their
mouths
full
of
clara
caught
at
the
skirts
of
his
coat
go
away
again
father
she
mumbled
peevishly
cries
for
you
in
the
night
and
i
get
to
he
swayed
as
if
struck
by
a
bullet
then
he
took
the
little
sticky
hand
and
suffered
himself
to
be
led
back
through
the
area
door
as
clara
unlatched
it
he
heard
her
mother
sobbing
hysterically
above
the
foolish
face
peeped
white
and
scared
from
the
kitchen
door
and
made
his
own
scarlet
with
shame
mistress
is
ill
he
muttered
and
ran
hastily
rosina
detected
his
footstep
and
the
sobs
changed
back
to
frenzied
laughter
then
she
controlled
both
by
sheer
pride
all
the
steel
in
her
springing
back
unsnapped
from
its
bend
and
she
opposed
a
mocking
smile
to
his
discomfited
concern
the
strength
that
had
kept
her
silent
for
years
was
now
summoned
to
undo
the
effects
of
speech
have
you
forgotten
she
asked
tauntingly
you
come
back
for
your
kiss
or
your
umbrella
or
what
kisses
off
an
old
married
couple
now
but
i
want
to
stick
to
your
umbrella
it
might
be
a
present
from
somebody
nice
there
an
umbrella
about
billy
no
dear
me
then
it
must
be
that
rose
ah
but
davie
gave
me
she
called
down
the
stairs
it
you
that
gave
me
the
rose
davie
yes
and
not
going
to
give
it
back
be
afraid
dear
mummy
give
away
her
present
did
bruise
himself
to
give
it
to
me
poor
davie
there
was
a
hectic
flush
on
her
cheek
her
voice
rang
false
matthew
was
afraid
she
jerked
after
a
pause
are
you
waiting
for
go
away
whispered
billy
nervously
shattered
by
the
scenes
of
the
afternoon
to
the
study
cool
down
the
suggestion
commended
itself
to
matthew
it
seemed
cowardly
to
leave
this
hysteric
couple
to
themselves
he
descended
the
kitchen
stairs
once
more
and
passed
along
the
corridor
that
led
to
his
old
studio
now
turned
into
a
workroom
for
billy
and
fitted
up
with
bookshelves
whose
contents
hid
the
whitewashed
walls
a
littered
with
papers
occupied
the
centre
of
the
floor
and
piles
of
manuscript
showed
within
a
little
angle
cupboard
whose
door
swung
open
there
were
several
reproductions
of
his
works
roughly
stuck
on
the
wall
one
a
valuable
engraving
signed
by
the
artist
and
the
of
was
already
represented
in
two
shapes
once
by
the
cut
out
of
pictures
and
again
by
a
photograph
of
it
from
the
a
shame
they
make
you
an
matt
said
billy
pictures
get
more
advertisement
for
the
academy
than
almost
anybody
sake
talk
of
that
now
said
the
painter
brokenly
his
eye
noted
curiously
that
ancient
engraving
of
angelus
miraculously
preserved
to
be
one
of
treasures
by
the
refusal
to
give
more
than
eighteenpence
for
it
it
was
a
poor
representative
of
the
original
but
the
other
ornaments
of
the
study
seemed
to
him
tawdry
in
comparison
his
taste
had
changed
the
picture
attracted
him
now
without
analyzing
the
turmoil
of
his
mind
did
not
permit
that
he
had
an
impression
of
sincerity
of
sympathetic
vision
of
work
done
inevitably
not
like
his
own
work
from
cleverness
despair
of
his
life
and
his
art
mingled
in
one
dark
paroxysm
as
he
dropped
upon
a
chair
and
laid
his
head
upon
the
you
may
get
your
hair
sticky
said
billy
think
quite
dry
i
was
just
pasting
it
in
before
you
he
withdrew
the
album
from
under
his
head
the
pious
compilation
with
which
he
fed
at
once
his
jealousy
and
his
pride
suppose
you
saw
that
little
sketch
of
your
life
in
this
month
matthew
did
not
answer
not
quite
accurate
you
know
went
on
billy
says
a
bachelor
and
that
you
were
born
in
canada
and
so
on
but
that
matter
there
are
always
mistakes

of
course
nobody
knows

his
fists
in
a
blind
rage
against
the
universe
this
was
what
the
public
read
and
believed
about
his
life
his
life
with
its
slow
sick
struggles
its
inner
and
outer
discords
its
poignant
pathos
and
this
was
what
he
read
and
believed
about
other
men
good
god
what
was
behind
their
lives
the
lives
of
his
fellows
whose
smooth
histories
he
read
in
biographical
summaries
the
possibilities
of
the
human
tragedy
frightened
him
then
the
realities
of
the
human
farce
seized
him
and
he
terrified
billy
by
a
long
peal
of
sardonic
laughter
the
laughter
ceased
suddenly
and
see
how
she
is
he
commanded
the
shuddering
billy
and
the
poor
cripple
now
less
frightened
of
rosina
than
of
his
brother
sped
away
as
fast
as
his
crutch
could
carry
him
left
alone
the
painter
looked
abstractedly
at
angelus
and
it
drifted
his
thoughts
back
to
the
time
when
he
had
tried
to
sell
it
for
bread
how
happy
were
those
times
of
youthful
aspiration
when
all
things
were
new
and
all
things
were
true
and
hunger
itself
was
but
a
sauce
to
eke
out
the
scanty
meal
what
was
starvation
to
this
terrible
hunger
for
happiness
what
the
want
of
money
to
this
want
of
something
to
live
for
ah
money
was
nothing
money
troubles
were
mental
figments
it
was
the
cark
of
life
that
killed
money
or
no
money
oh
to
be
young
and
free
again
free
to
be
a
slave
to
art
how
hollow
it
all
was
this
fame
this
running
about
this
society
that
welcomed
him
as
he
had
truly
told
billy
like
a
kind
of
monstrosity
he
had
been
happier
when
he
had
toiled
in
this
little
whitewashed
studio
even
after
his
mistaken
marriage
the
lines
of
the
poet
in
whom
he
had
read
most
of
late
fell
from
his
lips
like
an
original
personal
cry
i
could
lie
down
like
a
tired
child
and
weep
away
this
sordid
life
of
and
thus
billy
found
him
his
head
on
the
desk
his
shoulders
heaving
convulsively
he
cried
timidly
in
muffled
accents
gone
to
her
room
and
locked
herself
in
she
says
not
to
come
near
her
any
more
a
long
silence
i
dare
say
blow
over
matt
this
is
not
the
first
time
been
taken
like
that
though
not
been
here
to
bear
a
longer
silence
billy
cudgelled
his
brain
to
rouse
his
brother
saw
ruth
hailey
a
month
ago
he
said
at
last
this
time
he
succeeded
in
evoking
an
indifferent
monosyllable
she
called
here
to
see
us
she
was
in
london
she
had
got
our
address
from
abner
preep
before
leaving
america
i
gave
her
the
address
of
your
studio
but
she
said
she
was
uncertain
whether
she
would
have
time
to
look
you
up
she
seems
to
be
secretary
to
verder
the
rights
woman
goes
about
with
her
everywhere
linda
lectures
you
remember
them
at
the
hall
in
july
in
scotland
now
and
later
on
ruth
writes
to
me
for
i
asked
her
to
correspond
with
me
a
little
going
to
paris
for
a
course
under
the
patronage
of
the
american
embassy
stay
in
paris
some
time
as
linda
verder
wants
a
rest
badly
and
has
a
lot
of
american
friends
there
then
they
go
to
australia
and
new
zealand
curious
it
did
she
look
oh
gone
off
a
good
deal
to
my
thinking
she
must
be
getting
pretty
old
now
about
as
old
as
you
which
is
young
for
a
man
but
old
for
a
woman
but
her
eyes
are
fine
and
a
sweetness
i
describe
it
she
says
she
used
to
teach
in
the
states
and
though
she
enjoys
travelling
about
regrets
having
had
to
give
up
her
class
fancy
she
used
to
be
such
a
smart
girl
too
and
i
should
have
thought
the
deacon
had
disgusted
her
with
religion
you
know
she
have
anything
to
do
with
he
still
alive
just
as
spry
as
ever
his
curled
up
his
toes
though
old
hey
had
the
old
man
from
digby
to
live
with
him
and
they
used
to
go
at
it
hammer
and
billy
could
extract
no
further
answer
but
he
would
not
let
his
brother
go
that
night
insisting
he
must
sleep
with
him
as
usual
in
the
spare
bed
in
his
bedroom
about
nine
rosina
sent
a
specially
nice
supper
for
two
down
to
the
study
matthew
roused
himself
to
eat
a
morsel
to
keep
billy
company
and
then
before
going
to
his
sleepless
couch
in
room
bethought
himself
of
whiling
away
the
time
by
answering
some
letters
which
had
been
bulking
his
inner
for
days
one
of
these
was
a
reverential
request
for
an
autograph
addressed
from
a
country
house
and
backed
by
the
compulsive
seduction
of
a
stamped
envelope
his
emotions
were
exhausted
he
wrote
apathetically
truly
matthew
strang
writing
very
near
the
top
of

fear
of
fraud

vi
a
devonshire
idyl
the
yellow
coach
with
pyramidal
luggage
rattled
along
the
devonshire
coast
striking
its
apex
against
boughs
and
matthew
strang
sat
on
the
forgetting
london
in
the
prospect
of
eleanor
wyndwood
and
in
the
view
of
white
and
red
houses
scattered
like
about
a
steep
green
hill
overhanging
the
curve
of
a
lovely
bay
for
rosina
had
continued
obdurate
and
invisible
she
had
sent
up
breakfast
from
the
kitchen
without
appearing
and
with
an
irritating
air
of
cooking
for
a
and
he
fretful
and
anguished
after
a
wretched
wakeful
night
had
fled
snarling
even
at
billy
who
would
have
stayed
him
further
the
remembrance
of
her
cantankerousness
and
of
his
own
had
accompanied
him
all
the
way
to
devonshire
but
the
sight
of
the
sea
rolling
vast
and
green
and
the
wrinkled
unaging
sea
had
calmed
him
his
burdens
fell
from
him
the
last
vapors
of
london
the
torpid
miasma
of
the
packed
streets
the
cabbage
odors
of
camden
town
were
blown
afar
he
drew
deep
breaths
of
the
delicious
air
how
lucky
it
was
rosina
had
shied
at
the
suggestion
which
he
had
thrown
out
on
the
reckless
impulse
of
a
desperate
moment
how
could
they
possibly
live
together
any
more
to
draw
the
same
atmosphere
with
her
was
stifling
and
at
the
thought
his
deep
inspirations
took
on
a
new
voluptuousness
of
freedom
regained
decidedly
he
had
not
counted
the
cost
when
the
quixotic
proposal
sprang
to
his
lips
for
that
atmosphere
meant
death
to
his
soul
nothing
less
death
to
all
his
new
stirrings
and
yearnings
asphyxiation
to
his
art
ah
the
good
salt
air
let
it
blow
on
his
free
forehead
let
it
play
among
his
locks
let
it
whisper
the
brave
dreams
of
youth
till
the
nimble
blood
tingles
and
the
eyes
are
wet
with
tears
let
him
feel
the
freshness
of
morning
though
the
sun
is
hastening
westward
and
the
best
of
the
day
is
spent
the
coachman
blows
his
horn
and
the
hills
are
filled
with
the
echoes
of
romance
away
with
the
clogging
mists
and
the
moral
fogs
of
the
town
away
with
the
moody
vision
of
a
virago
in
a
gray
house
in
a
drab
labyrinth
and
ho
for
the
enchanted
cliffs
and
waters
where
loveliness
broods
like
light
over
earth
and
sea
and
a
spirit
that
is
half
a
woman
and
half
the
soul
of
all
beauty
waits
with
swelling
bosom
and
kindling
eyes
oh
the
bonny
horses
the
spanking
quartette
how
they
sweep
round
the
curves
and
dash
down
the
dales
and
how
gallantly
the
driver
holds
them
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
what
delightful
villages
primitive
as
the
rough
stone
of
which
they
are
built
what
quaint
old
hostels
and
archaic
streets
steeped
in
the
mingled
scent
of
the
sea
and
the
moors
here
be
orchards
here
be
cosey
cottages
and
sweet
homely
gardens
gay
with
nasturtiums
and
hollyhocks
and
with
roses
and
pansies
the
driver
airily
salutes
the
afternoon
over
the
ferny
walls
of
the
devonshire
lanes
the
outside
passengers
behold
the
red
crags
perching
picturesquely
on
the
like
petrified
monsters
of
an
earlier
era
and
the
trail
of
redder
gold
quivering
across
the
great
water
the
wind
rises
and
flecks
the
shimmering
green
as
with
a
flock
of
skimming
oh
the
beauty
of
the
good
round
earth
the
beauty
forgotten
and
blotted
out
in
the
reeking
back
streets
of
great
cities
oh
gracious
privilege
of
the
artist
to
seize
a
moment
of
the
flowing
loveliness
of
all
things
to
pass
it
through
the
alembic
of
his
soul
and
give
it
back
transfigured
and
immortal
feel
beauty
growing
under
the
words
were
they
chimed
celestially
in
his
ears
not
as
words
but
as
words
stored
up
as
in
a
phonograph
with
every
dainty
intonation
but
with
their
music
sweetened
rather
than
deadened
all
she
had
ever
said
to
him
he
could
recall
as
from
a
box
of
heavenly
airs
every
syllable
had
the
golden
cadence
of
poesie
to
love
her
was
to
be
young
again
fit
for
every
high
emprise
sensitive
to
every
tremor
of
fantasy
and
romance
that
the
tongue
was
clattering
tirelessly
of
his
horses
which
more
sensible
than
men
touch
a
drop
more
than
was
good
for
them
of
his
life
on
the
box
from
boyhood
his
content
his
pioneer
daughter
the
first
in
those
parts
to
wear
spectacles
his
pleasure
in
seeing
gentlefolk
come
down
to
circulate
the
money
his
scorn
of
but
matthew
private
phonograph
was
performing
with
equal
indefatigability
and
his
spirit
leaped
incessantly
from
one
to
the
other
touched
to
a
large
geniality
for
humanity
the
sun
was
sinking
royally
in
the
sea
like
a
viking
in
his
burning
vessel
when
the
coach
obligingly
drew
up
with
a
flourish
of
the
horn
and
a
scattering
of
chickens
and
a
barking
of
dogs
at
the
farm
where
herbert
had
his
headquarters
he
was
disappointed
not
to
find
herbert
there
to
receive
him
as
he
had
telegraphed
his
advent
but
just
as
he
was
comfortably
installed
and
was
beginning
to
wonder
whether
he
should
start
dining
alone
that
gentleman
galloped
up
flushed
with
health
and
sun
and
exercise
and
leaping
from
his
horse
gave
matthew
such
hearty
greeting
that
the
painter
had
a
grateful
sense
of
being
welcomed
to
an
ancient
seignorial
home
by
a
bluff
and
hospitable
squire
been
working
at
the
portrait
herbert
explained
ascending
to
his
room
with
his
hand
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
of
matthew
who
was
thus
forced
to
remount
the
stairs
course
i
keep
my
painting
kit
at
their
place
and
a
jolly
old
place
it
is
with
the
sea
cleaning
the
doorsteps
or
pretty
nearly
beastly
comfortable
with
their
london
servants
and
carriages
and
a
motherly
old
person
who
seems
a
combination
of
cook
and
chaperon
and
turns
out
delicious
dishes
and
taken
on
a
native
girl
to
help
them
a
sweet
simple
creature
with
cheeks
like
strawberries
and
cream
do
you
remember
the
lady
who
said
strawberries
and
cream
needed
only
to
be
forbidden
to
be
an
ecstasy
these
forbidden
oh
look
glum
i
indulged
forbidden
fruit
is
out
of
season
tired
of
it
generally
canned
and
i
have
had
too
much
of
the
foreign
brands
ugh
i
can
see
the
litter
of
broken
tins
developing
a
healthy
taste
for
the
article
without
any
prohibitive
matthew
turned
to
grasp
his
hand
silently
as
though
sealing
some
compact
he
felt
it
was
eleanor
whose
magnetism
had
uplifted
herbert
to
that
reverence
for
womanhood
he
himself
had
always
entertained
it
was
impossible
to
live
under
her
spell
and
remain
coarse
and
paradoxically
enough
he
was
glad
herbert
was
living
on
a
higher
plane
it
strengthened
him
in
his
own
purely
spiritual
devotion
to
the
beautiful
friend
of
his
soul
how
stupid
to
have
hesitated
how
commonplace
and
ignoble
to
have
gone
to
see
rosina
for
fear
of
influence
upon
him
like
the
old
roman
he
had
lost
a
day
and
he
had
uselessly
harrowed
his
soul
to
boot
and
yet
perhaps
not
altogether
uselessly
he
reflected
consolingly
the
visit
had
laid
the
ghost
of
remorse
the
full
daylight
had
been
turned
upon
the
situation
he
had
seen
beyond
reach
of
further
doubt
that
he
was
not
to
blame
for
it
that
he
was
the
victim
of
the
blind
tragedy
of
circumstance
true
the
full
daylight
had
also
revealed
that
rosina
was
taking
the
situation
far
more
tragically
than
he
had
ever
allowed
himself
to
suspect
it
was
pitiful
but
it
could
not
be
helped
his
own
mother
had
fared
far
worse
her
living
death
had
taught
him
resentful
resignation
to
the
workings
of
fate
no
rosina
must
be
put
on
one
side
he
had
lost
happiness
his
art
at
least
must
be
saved
waiting
for
herbert
to
change
his
clothes
he
looked
out
of
the
casement
and
saw
a
lonely
white
wraith
of
a
moon
glimmering
in
the
great
spaces
over
the
great
lonely
deep
and
heard
the
moan
of
the
waves
under
the
lash
and
watched
the
sunset
dying
in
pale
greens
and
pinks
and
saffrons
and
so
in
an
exalted
mood
went
down
to
dinner
it
was
getting
towards
nine
when
the
cousins
lit
their
cigars
and
strolled
along
the
cliffs
their
feet
taking
them
westwards
where
phosphorescent
streaks
of
light
green
lingered
in
the
sky
sending
out
thinner
lucent
shoots
to
join
the
eastern
gray
show
you
the
house
not
more
than
a
mile
herbert
volunteered
call
said
matthew
not
with
a
madcap
like
olive
you
mind
my
calling
her
olive
do
you
old
man
laughed
matthew
then
if
i
may
call
her
olive
why
i
call
on
her
in
the
evening
but
an
argument
rather
in
vein
though
it
appears
to
puzzle
you
ha
ha
ha
but
you
bring
your
london
etiquette
down
here
with
you
my
boy
he
went
on
in
a
harangue
tempered
by
puffs
better
send
it
back
by
the
carrier
if
you
packed
it
in
your
luggage
by
mistake
in
another
world
and
in
an
earlier
century
what
a
superficial
view
to
think
contemporaries
live
in
the
same
century
these
people
as
yet
unsophisticated
by
the
tourist
are
living
in
the
seventeenth
century
at
the
latest
burn
olive
for
a
witch
if
they
knew
her
as
i
do
the
droll
elf
with
her
masculine
brain
and
her
tricksy
femininity
i
think
lived
in
every
place
and
time
under
the
sun
been
with
brigands
and
monks
and
in
jerusalem
with
the
jews
i
was
back
in
the
ages
i
really
think
all
the
centuries
live
side
by
side
there
must
have
been
people
in
the
times
just
as
there
are
people
living
in
times
fancy
thinking
these
bucolics
an
evolutionary
advance
on
pericles
and
horace
evolution
must
move
like
those
waves
down
below
sending
scouts
out
here
and
there
far
in
advance
of
the
general
march
of
the
waters
whenever
a
hollow
curve
in
the
coast
a
century
man
myself
which
makes
the
nineteenth
call
me
godless
and
immoral
but
what
were
we
talking
about
knows
oh
i
know
aware
you
are
goodness
incarnate
interpolated
herbert
was
saying
we
call
on
wyndwood
but
why
wyndwood
want
a
stroll
after
dinner
as
much
as
we
i
told
her
of
your
wire
what
more
natural
than
that
they
should
stroll
eastward
and
herbert
smiled
mysteriously
as
one
with
experience
told
you
we
made
our
own
etiquette
laws
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
are
the
community
we
four
the
only
civilized
beings
in
a
loutish
world
we
began
as
a
triumvirate
but
your
coming
has
changed
the
form
of
government
you
are
the
fourth
party
we
are
now
what
shall
i
say
a
constitutional
as
herbert
rattled
on
matthew
felt
more
and
more
the
fascination
of
his
gay
cousin
whose
white
teeth
flashed
as
facetiously
as
in
the
days
of
yore
and
whose
lissome
figure
was
a
continuous
pleasure
to
the
artistic
eye
gratitude
mingled
with
his
admiration
but
for
ingenuity
he
would
never
have
been
a
citizen
of
the
earthly
paradise
that
was
opening
before
him
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
rose
like
incense
on
the
solemn
air
upon
which
the
sound
of
the
wind
and
the
sea
broke
like
a
hush
under
foot
were
gorse
and
bracken
mixed
with
sparse
sprouts
of
grass
overhead
a
rich
yellow
partly
hidden
by
scowling
clouds
but
throwing
a
band
of
pale
gold
that
changed
with
the
deepening
dusk
to
rippling
silver
across
the
sombre
bay
in
whose
distant
cliffs
the
lights
of
vague
scattered
villages
twinkled
mysteriously
suggesting
romantic
windows
of
illumined
hollow
chambers
in
the
steep
rock
and
presently
white
figures
were
seen
advancing
slowly
to
meet
them
pausing
each
instant
as
if
to
drink
in
the
beauty
of
the
night
there
they
are
cried
herbert
there
are
three
of
them
said
matthew
in
disappointed
tones
the
maid
carrying
a
reserve
of
wraps
you
duffer
throw
away
your
cigar
olive
herself
with
a
cigarette
if
my
eyes
do
not
deceive
but
matthew
cigar
went
out
ere
the
two
parties
sauntering
more
slowly
than
before
they
had
become
unconscious
of
each
other
were
startled
to
find
themselves
face
to
face
his
heart
was
beating
furiously
as
if
he
were
really
startled
by
the
apparition
of
a
queenly
figure
and
a
lovely
flushed
face
on
the
background
of
the
night
a
smile
danced
in
the
eyes
and
parted
the
red
lips
with
an
expression
of
more
eager
welcome
than
had
ever
been
accorded
him
in
town
and
there
was
a
more
intimate
pressure
in
the
clasp
of
the
warm
hand
subtly
heralding
a
new
phase
in
their
friendship
in
this
disappearance
of
the
conventional
stage
properties
of
the
fashionable
human
scene
in
this
isolation
amid
the
primitiveness
of
nature
and
of
a
humanity
simpler
than
their
own
while
miss
cigarette
and
her
frank
laugh
and
indicated
less
subtly
but
no
less
pleasantly
the
commencement
of
a
artistic
period
which
loomed
more
agreeably
to
matthew
than
any
of
the
periods
herbert
had
boasted
of
living
in
to
the
creamery
said
olive
rather
to
the
as
had
to
call
it
why
you
put
on
your
wraps
said
matthew
anxiously
comparatively
tropical
and
we
had
to
give
primitiva
a
pretext
for
accompanying
us
this
is
primitiva
rose
the
the
pretty
lass
made
a
courtesy
was
the
post
you
know
when
we
first
came
she
used
to
bring
letters
from
the
which
is
near
you
and
our
first
acquaintance
with
the
post
was
to
find
it
in
tears
because
it
had
lost
a
letter
of
ours
she
had
dropped
it
it
an
important
letter
asked
matthew
is
very
nearly
a
bull
strang
replied
olive
as
the
letter
was
picked
up
by
a
i
am
able
to
tell
you
it
of
the
slightest
importance
merely
a
request
from
harold
lavender
to
be
allowed
to
dedicate
his
next
book
of
poems
to
nor
still
it
might
have
been
important
it
might
have
contained
a
you
mean
a
poem
or
a
order
laughed
wyndwood
turning
a
flippant
face
towards
over
which
a
cloud
had
come
like
that
now
entirely
over
the
moon
said
olive
gravely
a
proposal
of
marriage
but
it
odd
to
see
the
post
crying
i
fell
in
love
with
her
at
once
i
saw
that
such
a
quaint
creature
would
do
more
good
to
me
than
to
her
service
and
so
hey
presto
she
was
whisked
from
the
and
changed
into
a
oh
what
a
refreshing
contrast
with
the
london
servant
added
wyndwood
is
really
a
servant
not
a
critic
on
the
said
olive
believes
that
all
london
ladies
smoke
and
considers
nor
eccentric
for
not
indulging
and
whatever
i
tell
her
is
gospel
she
thinks
like
george
washington
invariably
she
thinks
you
eccentric
too
said
herbert
smiling
back
eyes
danced
her
lips
quivered
trying
to
keep
back
the
smile
of
response
your
cynicism
for
town
sir
she
said
think
anything
of
the
kind
the
world
is
not
a
whited
sepulchre
to
her
it
is
lucky
i
removed
her
from
the
sphere
of
your
blighting
grumbled
herbert
our
daughter
matt
and
she
might
have
hovered
about
our
leave
marguerite
in
the
way
of
faust
said
olive
plumply
matthew
strang
winced
miss
plain
speaking
grated
upon
him
and
he
saw
that
wyndwood
had
lowered
her
eyes
in
like
annoyance
and
had
commenced
to
walk
homewards
and
he
resented
this
preoccupation
with
primitiva
he
feared
she
was
going
to
play
the
part
of
the
dog
roy
herbert
hummed
an
operatic
bar
or
two
and
broke
off
laughing
wish
i
had
voice
a
lovely
tenor
voice
was
apparently
among
the
profits
of
his
bargain
with
the
miss
regan
laughed
merrily
you
going
back
nor
she
called
out
said
wyndwood
must
say
we
must
see
you
home
protested
matthew
as
he
moved
to
her
side
really
no
need
she
returned
meet
so
dark
said
matthew
for
the
moon
still
dallied
behind
its
and
threw
only
a
faint
wavering
circle
of
light
on
the
weird
water
though
the
stars
were
now
clear
enough
come
along
cried
olive
bounding
forwards
from
side
rather
to
his
disgust
straight
home
and
waving
her
in
the
darkness
she
disappeared
in
the
earth
like
a
red
witch
herbert
dashed
after
her
down
the
cliff
descent
the
exhilaration
of
their
spirits
caught
eleanor
she
was
swallowed
down
abruptly
matthew
followed
more
cautiously
wondering
and
then
began
a
mad
unforgetable
breakneck
joyous
scramble
in
the
darkness
down
the
steepest
and
craggiest
of
roughly
worn
paths
diversified
by
great
sheer
gaps
without
foothold
for
a
goat
down
which
they
had
to
drop
at
first
matthew
tried
to
steady
and
help
himself
by
clutching
at
the
vegetation
and
bushes
through
which
the
path
broke
but
it
was
all
and
prickly
gorse
and
his
involuntary
interjections
were
answered
by
peals
of
mocking
laughter
from
the
invisible
pioneer
below
do
you
like
seeing
us
home
she
called
up
but
matthew
was
rapt
far
beyond
the
sting
of
taunts
and
wyndwood
was
only
a
few
inches
ahead
of
him
every
moment
she
turned
to
cheer
him
on
and
her
face
was
close
to
his
and
the
divine
darkness
was
filled
with
light
and
perfume
twice
or
thrice
in
this
descent
she
gave
him
a
helping
hand
as
one
familiar
with
the
ground
and
he
took
it
with
no
sense
of
unmanliness
careful
here
she
said
once
the
brambles
will
scratch
your
face
and
she
looked
up
adorably
from
her
insecure
perch
below
holding
the
prickly
apart
with
her
upper
arm
as
he
slid
cautiously
towards
her
blissfully
conscious
that
this
sharing
of
common
if
petty
peril
was
bringing
them
together
beyond
the
reach
of
ceremonial
coldness
for
evermore
sometimes
the
gray
sea
showed
below
through
the
interstices
on
the
left
and
its
dull
boom
mingled
with
the
gentle
swish
of
the
wind
and
the
gurgle
of
a
little
the
last
twenty
feet
were
the
worst
and
they
were
aggravated
by
the
banter
of
the
couple
safely
below
herbert
had
never
caught
up
with
olive
who
had
skeltered
down
like
a
leaving
a
trail
of
gay
ejaculations
but
wyndwood
herself
had
to
be
helped
in
the
precipitous
windings
of
the
base
with
its
tiny
niches
of
crumbling
stone
at
long
intervals
and
now
in
sweet
revenge
matthew
held
her
hand
to
steady
her
from
above
while
below
herbert
waited
with
open
arms
for
her
final
jump
an
odd
recollection
of
his
climbing
down
the
steeple
in
economy
flashed
through
his
brain
as
he
himself
half
slipped
half
leaped
to
the
ground
hot
and
red
and
breathless
and
gratitude
for
the
miraculous
metamorphosis
in
his
fortunes
added
to
the
tenderness
of
his
mood
how
good
it
was
to
be
alive
there
in
the
brave
night
moneyed
and
famous
and
still
young
glowing
with
physical
amid
a
joyous
human
company
with
a
delightful
friend
and
cousin
and
two
brilliant
and
beautiful
ladies
both
members
of
that
fashionable
world
which
had
once
filled
him
with
envious
bitterness
and
one
of
them
a
woman
whose
presence
made
everything
magical
rosina
was
very
shadowy
now
they
seemed
in
a
great
closed
circle
walled
by
cliffs
with
a
roof
fretted
by
stars
two
glooming
pools
made
dark
patches
in
the
lighter
soil
and
they
heard
the
stir
of
fish
deserted
stone
quarry
olive
explained
are
carp
in
the
pools
said
herbert
live
outside
said
wyndwood
nearer
over
the
cliff
and
more
ladylike
added
olive
was
hardly
fair
to
matthew
strang
though
eleanor
remarked
smiling
all
learned
the
way
in
the
daylight
when
you
see
it
in
the
morning
strang
find
it
sometimes
within
a
few
inches
of
the
sheer
precipice
and
if
you
had
caught
hold
of
the
bushes
to
stay
your
fall
you
would
have
dropped
them
like
a
nest
we
ought
to
have
warned
him
in
the
dark
we
had
warned
him
he
would
have
fallen
laughed
olive
gayly
could
walk
a
plank
over
a
precipice
if
he
thought
it
was
on
the
ground
ignorance
is
salvation
but
you
will
have
to
come
in
strangs
and
brush
yourselves
before
you
go
what
a
nuisance
your
both
having
the
same
name
when
i
insult
herbert
i
shall
excite
the
animosity
of
matthew
and
vice
versa
i
really
think
nor
we
shall
have
to
call
them
by
their
christian
when
together
said
wyndwood
smiling
must
always
stick
together
matt
cried
herbert
with
jocose
enthusiasm
hand
might
call
one
the
painter
began
wyndwood
the
other
ungrateful
olive
remonstrated
the
beautiful
success
herbert
has
made
of
meant
herbert
replied
eleanor
roguishly
and
for
once
olive
had
no
retort
ready
even
taking
the
portrait
into
account
the
painter
said
herbert
placing
his
hand
lovingly
on
the
shoulder
of
his
friend
who
thrilled
with
a
sense
of
his
me
the
are
both
painters
miss
regan
persisted
the
problem
is
solved
one
is
herbert
and
the
other
she
took
arm
and
led
the
way
to
the
house
when
are
you
a
playwright
herbert
asked
matthew
as
they
fell
a
little
into
the
rear
of
sarcasm
you
beggar
always
been
a
playwright
you
remember
my
doing
a
burlesque
for
the
academy
students
writing
a
comedy
in
the
evenings
the
lessee
of
the
folly
is
a
friend
of
mine
i
must
make
some
money
now
that
hundred
pounds
i
owe
you
and
i
know
not
going
to
make
it
by
surely
you
will
let
me
know
if
you
want
anything
said
matthew
with
genuine
concern
for
there
seemed
something
immoral
in
the
idea
of
herbert
feeling
the
pinch
of
need
to
say
nothing
of
his
shock
at
finding
that
his
cousin
had
run
through
all
that
money
herbert
had
indeed
several
times
hinted
at
his
impecuniosity
but
matthew
had
never
taken
him
seriously
herbert
shook
his
head
know
a
brick
old
chap
but
a
hundred
pounds
is
as
much
as
i
care
to
owe
any
one
you
consider
me
one
awfully
good
of
you
to
remember
that
i
did
as
much
for
you
comparatively
speaking
in
your
tenpenny
times
but
still
it
quite
agreeable
to
find
bread
on
the
waters
after
many
days
i
never
did
like
soaked
bread
even
in
milk
the
most
i
could
do
would
be
to
let
you
settle
up
every
week
with
father
but
really
halves
mind
you
and
when
my
comedy
is
produced
have
to
reckon
with
me
they
like
what
written
the
women
they
think
make
a
hit
i
read
them
the
work
after
lunch
the
next
day
of
course
i
always
lunch
with
them
after
the
sitting
ah
here
we
are
they
had
emerged
from
the
sheltered
quarry
and
met
the
smack
of
the
salt
wind
from
the
moaning
a
lawn
ran
out
to
meet
the
pebbly
beach
from
which
it
was
separated
by
a
low
stone
wall
the
ancient
house
stood
out
radiantly
cheerful
against
the
dusky
background
of
the
night
and
the
cliffs
primitiva
was
at
the
door
looking
out
anxiously
and
a
shared
her
anxiety
or
at
least
her
vigil
delightful
exclaimed
matthew
we
lucky
said
wyndwood
an
old
family
residence
the
owner
kept
it
untenanted
for
thirty
years
and
has
never
consented
to
let
it
the
ladies
took
off
their
things
while
the
men
brushed
themselves
in
the
hall
where
divided
by
a
heavily
carved
barometer
a
pair
of
faded
hung
a
gentleman
in
a
wig
and
a
lady
in
a
coif
these
reminded
miss
regan
that
matthew
must
see
how
splendidly
portrait
of
wyndwood
had
turned
out
after
all
rogue
she
cried
soon
as
he
thought
the
sittings
were
to
cease
the
picture
picked
up
wonderfully
and
now
with
it
again
so
they
wandered
through
the
large
rambling
house
with
its
belongings
till
they
reached
the
room
which
herbert
had
been
allowed
to
use
as
a
studio
matthew
saw
with
joy
that
herbert
had
let
the
glorious
face
and
figure
be
as
he
himself
had
painted
them
in
that
spurt
of
inspiration
and
had
confined
his
own
attention
to
the
minutiæ
of
the
dress
which
was
nearly
finished
olive
held
a
lamp
to
it
awaiting
his
praises
he
had
a
moment
of
embarrassment
is
very
beautiful
he
said
ambiguously
but
rapturously
then
turning
to
herbert
he
added
heartily
your
comedy
is
only
as
good
old
fellow
will
be
said
wyndwood
enthusiastically
should
write
comedy
if
not
a
man
like
strang
i
mean
herbert
a
man
who
has
seen
the
manners
of
men
and
cities
i
should
think
he
could
do
it
even
better
than
he
can
he
has
one
disadvantage
said
olive
gloomily
is
herbert
stood
bowing
with
his
hand
on
his
breast
in
mock
acknowledgment
his
boyish
face
looked
flushed
and
handsome
in
the
lamplight
matthew
had
a
spasm
of
despair
a
momentary
sense
of
being
an
outsider
practise
your
footlights
bow
here
said
olive
one
has
called
are
called
but
few
chosen
quoted
herbert
wonder
how
i
should
come
out
under
brush
said
eleanor
turning
to
matthew
his
black
fit
vanished
he
was
taken
back
again
into
the
charmed
circle
but
the
question
remained
awkward
more
beautiful
than
this
he
murmured
you
will
give
me
the
pleasure
i
am
here
to
paint
partly
that
in
town
not
here
i
want
to
be
out
and
about
olive
we
must
give
them
something
before
they
go
back
through
the
cold
olive
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
refreshment
they
adjourned
to
the
a
spacious
apartment
with
strange
heavy
antique
furniture
and
curious
bronzes
and
vases
the
made
more
quaint
by
the
irrelevant
presence
of
a
chair
with
its
high
stiff
canvas
back
fished
that
up
from
the
kitchen
said
olive
jolly
to
sit
there
and
imagine
self
an
old
crone
nodding
to
last
she
seated
herself
upon
it
forthwith
and
against
the
white
canvas
her
dark
face
shone
lovely
and
young
and
more
provoking
by
the
suggestive
contrast
herbert
stood
over
her
fidgeting
his
fingers
drumming
nervously
on
the
canvas
awning
she
sprang
up
and
threw
back
the
lid
of
a
mahogany
instrument
and
began
to
play
a
joyous
melody
matthew
had
seated
himself
in
an
near
the
window
eleanor
her
superb
arms
and
neck
bare
was
opposite
him
a
wonderful
white
vision
in
the
light
he
caught
her
eyes
and
they
smiled
at
him
the
friendly
smile
that
means
nothing
and
everything
as
olive
touched
the
keys
his
breast
grew
tenderer
where
had
he
heard
those
tinkling
harmonies
before
his
dead
childhood
came
back
to
him
for
a
moment
it
was
a
harpsichord
and
the
last
person
he
had
heard
playing
it
was
ruth
hailey
a
vision
of
her
girlish
figure
flitted
before
him
then
passed
into
the
picture
of
the
young
woman
with
the
sweet
earnest
eyes
that
billy
had
conjured
up
then
faded
into
the
sweeter
vision
of
reality
as
through
eyes
still
misty
he
saw
bosom
softly
rising
and
falling
with
the
melody
the
joyous
soul
of
which
sparkled
in
her
eager
eyes
the
tune
grew
merrier
madder
herbert
was
at
the
side
now
he
was
talking
to
her
as
her
long
white
fingers
darted
among
the
keys
suddenly
the
music
jarred
and
stopped
olive
leaped
up
and
ran
to
the
window
and
threw
it
open
and
a
cold
wind
swept
in
and
the
solemn
sobbing
of
the
waves
it
is
she
cried
great
lonely
blackness
roaring
outside
like
a
wild
beast
in
its
lonely
agony
we
shut
it
out
with
our
walls
and
hang
them
with
pictures
and
plaques
but
there
it
is
all
the
same
and
all
our
tapestries
can
not
quite
deaden
its
wail
you
hear
it
in
the
darkness
you
hear
it
crying
out
there
the
pain
of
the
world
wyndwood
sprang
up
in
alarm
and
closed
the
window
olive
calm
yourself
she
said
tenderly
pressing
the
face
to
her
bosom
olive
broke
from
her
with
a
peal
of
laughter
look
as
if
you
had
seen
a
ghost
nor
are
you
afraid
of
the
black
night
that
you
shut
it
out
are
you
out
of
tune
with
it
already
exaggerate
the
pain
of
the
world
dearest
said
eleanor
soothingly
herbert
looked
startled
pain
of
the
world
he
said
futility
of
the
world
you
mean
people
eat
and
drink
and
go
to
theatres
and
over
their
graves
the
parson
prates
of
infinities
and
immortalities
religion
is
too
big
for
us
like
mice
in
a
are
olive
dropped
wearily
into
the
chair
said
man
be
and
ridiculus
eyes
kindled
are
small
most
times
she
said
there
are
moments
when
as
wordsworth
says
love
through
hope
and
transcendent
dower
we
feel
that
we
are
greater
than
we
not
afraid
olive
there
i
open
the
window
again
come
and
look
not
at
the
black
night
but
up
at
the
soul
melted
in
worship
he
moved
to
her
side
and
refreshed
by
the
cool
sea
air
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
vault
where
the
moon
had
now
suffused
the
dark
clouds
which
seemed
to
have
grown
light
and
porous
the
two
infinities
of
sky
and
sea
brooded
together
in
the
night
ineffably
solemn
olive
would
not
budge
stars
she
shuddered
lonely
wyndwood
did
not
hear
her
the
plough
she
said
the
polar
star
in
a
straight
line
and
cassiopeia
and
all
i
know
but
oh
surely
they
are
havens
of
rest
where
the
tears
are
wiped
from
all
her
voice
faltered
her
face
was
rapt
as
in
prayer
you
put
something
over
your
shoulders
matthew
said
anxiously
quite
warm
unless
perhaps
we
take
a
turn
up
and
down
the
beach
before
you
go
shall
we
it
looks
so
divine
out
he
was
startled
and
intoxicated
by
the
proposal
you
come
too
olive
nearly
ten
we
must
be
sending
them
home
to
their
farm
or
father
will
bar
the
door
already
we
have
a
reputation
for
witchcraft
because
our
house
shines
afar
at
eleven
a
beacon
of
evil
to
all
the
neighboring
hamlets
in
london
we
should
just
be
preparing
to
go
am
tired
nor
you
can
have
a
turn
if
you
like
you
go
too
herbert
hesitated
it
be
fair
to
leave
you
company
prevent
one
from
being
alone
to
have
a
turn
in
a
moment
anyhow
said
herbert
weakly
alas
leave
them
to
fight
it
and
wyndwood
laid
her
hand
a
moment
on
shoulder
thrilling
him
they
went
out
under
the
stars
she
had
taken
only
a
light
fleecy
wrap
beneath
which
the
white
shoulders
were
half
defined
half
divined
they
went
across
the
lawn
and
through
the
gate
and
crunching
lightly
over
the
little
pebbles
walked
towards
where
the
surf
bubbled
white
in
the
grayness
all
was
very
still
save
for
the
eternal
monotone
of
the
sea
there
were
a
few
yellow
glimmers
from
the
villages
on
the
cliffs
far
to
the
east
a
sent
watery
rays
across
the
night
they
stood
without
speaking
in
a
religious
ecstasy
breathing
in
the
salt
air
at
last
the
delicious
silence
was
broken
by
her
more
delicious
voice
am
so
glad
you
came
she
said
simply
his
breast
swelled
painfully
are
very
good
to
i
mean
your
cousin
will
have
that
all
he
said
audaciously
then
he
likes
to
be
with
miss
that
all
she
smiled
are
too
ambiguous
the
plain
truth
is
that
your
cousin
prefers
to
talk
to
miss
regan
alone
and
i
care
about
appearing
a
marplot
you
know
the
he
was
never
shrewd
harassed
as
he
had
been
by
his
own
affairs
admiration
of
olive
had
never
struck
him
as
a
serious
passion
he
conceived
his
cousin
as
a
philandering
person
a
man
of
many
flirtations
but
now
the
suggestion
that
came
from
lips
seemed
to
throw
a
flood
of
light
on
everything
even
on
remark
about
forbidden
fruit
for
once
herbert
was
veritably
in
love
in
his
relief
at
the
choice
of
a
definite
flower
he
forgot
to
resent
reason
for
giving
himself
her
company
you
sure
it
you
he
admires
he
asked
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
her
denial
no
an
old
staid
prosaic
mature
widow
my
romance
is
over
she
sighed
she
never
looked
more
spiritual
than
thus
in
the
moonlight
but
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
the
conventional
compliments
he
asked
simply
what
about
miss
regan
i
should
not
tell
you
if
i
knew
and
i
know
i
profess
to
understand
miss
regan
i
never
knew
any
one
so
easy
to
live
with
and
so
difficult
to
understand
but
as
she
understand
herself
i
feel
humiliated
of
course
she
has
always
had
men
at
her
feet
and
she
has
refused
one
of
the
most
brilliant
in
the
kingdom
i
was
afraid
she
hated
men
and
still
uncertain
if
she
ever
does
marry
i
think
it
will
be
to
spite
her
relatives
to
make
them
lament
she
has
thrown
herself
away
did
i
tell
you
that
she
quarrelled
with
them
all
and
came
to
live
with
me
you
told
me
and
you
were
unhappy
then
she
passed
her
hand
across
her
eyes
but
did
not
speak
are
not
unhappy
now
she
smiled
you
fishing
for
compliments
illustration
was
very
still
save
for
the
eternal
monotone
of
the
not
only
i
am
so
sorry
for
his
voice
trembled
us
walk
along
she
said
he
obeyed
are
not
angry
with
me
for
being
sorry
he
faltered
sympathy
is
always
sweet
though
i
do
not
deserve
it
some
people
will
tell
people
he
asked
fiercely
people
they
all
say
i
saddened
my
last
hours
he
was
brought
home
dead
from
the
you
know
he
had
been
but
no
mortuis
nil
nisi
me
he
said
softly
she
began
to
speak
then
broke
off
why
should
i
tell
you
she
said
gently
because
i
want
to
be
your
her
bosom
heaved
she
caught
her
breath
was
a
vile
she
shuddered
left
me
with
an
oath
on
his
matthew
strang
was
at
he
ground
the
pebbles
furiously
under
his
foot
oh
the
infamy
of
society
that
this
lily
should
have
been
handled
roughly
it
was
sacrilege
and
yet
in
some
subtle
way
he
felt
her
more
human
than
before
she
too
painful
as
it
was
to
realize
it
had
known
the
mire
of
life
she
too
this
delicate
flower
of
womanhood
though
it
had
left
her
unsullied
ethereal
still
then
she
would
understand
what
he
had
gone
through
she
would
know
how
coarse
and
unlovely
life
could
be
he
felt
strangely
nearer
to
her
heart
at
this
moment
some
icy
partition
had
melted
away
she
ceased
walking
and
put
both
hands
over
her
face
the
fleecy
wrap
quivered
on
her
shoulders
he
waited
in
silent
reverence
i
inconsiderate
she
said
at
last
lifting
her
face
dimmed
with
tears
forbearing
angel
he
whispered
hear
another
story
from
his
people
all
except
olive
they
will
tell
you
that
that
i
am
a
she
smiled
wistfully
he
had
no
words
hot
enough
he
kicked
a
stone
savagely
vile
slanderers
he
cried
are
all
tarred
with
the
same
brush
lucky
to
be
done
with
was
young
gerard
brode
staying
in
the
house
a
mere
boy
up
from
oxford
and
bubbling
over
with
socialism
i
was
interested
in
his
theories
and
we
had
long
talks
and
i
tried
to
convert
douglas
that
was
my
poor
husband
and
to
persuade
him
that
we
ought
to
divide
our
property
with
everybody
but
he
met
me
with
coarse
ribaldry
and
said
he
going
to
divide
his
wife
with
any
man
least
of
all
a
like
gerard
brode
and
feeble
taunts
like
that
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
our
wyndwood
he
said
and
felt
it
a
sweet
privilege
to
pity
her
so
you
spent
your
fortune
on
the
she
smiled
sadly
my
fortune
poor
douglas
never
lived
to
inherit
and
i
born
with
a
gold
spoon
in
my
mouth
though
it
had
a
crest
on
it
but
who
has
been
telling
you
about
my
indiscretions
she
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
adding
there
you
know
all
about
me
now
and
her
pathetic
smile
had
a
dazzling
though
it
flickered
away
as
she
wound
up
meditatively
wonder
why
i
told
you
shall
we
go
in
yet
he
pleaded
hastily
if
you
knew
how
proud
i
am
of
your
confidences
that
they
should
be
made
to
me
to
me
oh
if
you
knew
what
my
life
has
been
he
felt
choking
terrify
me
she
returned
lightly
very
dreadful
i
am
nothing
he
struggled
with
his
voice
have
slept
in
the
streets
i
have
consorted
with
the
the
more
honor
to
you
that
you
are
if
i
had
met
you
before
you
would
have
inspired
me
uplifted
higher
than
you
you
understand
i
have
been
so
is
not
a
have
been
in
were
innocent
her
face
shone
was
only
for
debt
i
was
the
victim
of
a
bankruptcy
and
i
have
paid
it
all
off
since
but
the
stain
the
laws
that
put
you
he
gulped
down
the
great
lump
that
made
his
throat
dry
and
painful
was
born
in
a
poor
village
no
one
cared
for
she
stooped
down
and
plucked
up
a
how
sturdily
it
grows
among
the
stones
now
all
the
of
the
long
solitary
years
burst
forth
in
a
great
torrent
breaking
through
the
proud
passionate
reserve
that
no
living
being
had
ever
penetrated
his
soul
yielded
up
its
secrets
in
a
strange
blend
of
pride
and
yearning
for
the
sympathy
have
had
to
carry
the
hod
to
climb
the
climbed
nearer
but
i
swabbed
the
touched
life
at
first
hand
i
have
never
envied
you
so
much
as
now
we
never
get
near
its
secret
we
idle
glorify
my
past
for
me
i
see
it
now
as
a
divine
education
i
have
been
living
for
false
ideals
oh
if
you
could
glorify
my
future
should
be
proud
to
inspire
it
the
flash
in
her
eyes
passed
to
his
i
could
see
you
every
day
if
i
could
tell
you
my
hopes
my
dreams
but
what
am
i
asking
it
is
impossible
you
are
the
beautiful
wyndwood
and
i
genius
a
master
towering
over
a
humble
slave
her
eyes
swimming
in
tears
but
shining
still
like
stars
through
rain
sought
his
in
humble
adoration
never
had
he
pictured
such
a
look
from
her
he
shook
divining
possibilities
for
a
moment
he
forgot
everything
he
caught
her
hot
hand
and
held
it
to
his
lips
in
that
frenzy
of
divine
fever
half
fire
half
tears
he
felt
again
that
love
rationalized
life
an
infinity
of
thought
and
emotion
was
concentred
in
the
instant
his
long
sordid
struggles
his
craving
for
happiness
the
infinite
yearning
with
which
as
a
boy
in
a
lonely
forest
he
had
looked
up
at
the
stars
this
was
the
secret
of
his
yearning
this
the
flash
that
illumined
life
and
underlying
and
intertangled
with
everything
an
astonishment
at
the
vast
sweep
of
life
the
possibilities
it
held
last
night
rosina
and
camden
town
eleanor
and
the
sea
and
the
stars
she
drew
her
hand
away
gently
though
there
was
no
rebuke
in
the
withdrawal
murmuring
must
be
going
in
and
straightway
the
image
of
rosina
arose
sinister
and
vindictive
her
voice
raucous
and
strained
to
a
ghastly
jocosity
crying
off
and
then
as
he
moved
silently
towards
the
house
thrilling
with
the
memory
of
her
hand
and
her
look
prisoned
sobs
still
fluttering
at
his
throat
he
had
a
sudden
paradoxical
intuition
that
if
he
spoke
of
his
wife
as
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
doing
something
would
go
out
of
the
magic
of
those
touches
and
glances
all
spiritual
though
they
were
the
figure
of
rosina
sinister
and
vindictive
would
stand
between
their
souls
troubling
their
most
transcendental
moments
was
not
a
wife
the
natural
recipient
of
his
confidences
the
nurse
of
his
art
and
then
if
eleanor
knew
that
he
was
ashamed
of
his
wife
that
he
had
always
passed
as
a
bachelor
would
she
not
deem
him
contemptible
the
fine
ethical
sense
that
had
refused
to
despise
him
for
material
degradations
would
it
not
certainly
scorn
him
for
moral
weaknesses
a
great
temptation
took
him
not
to
imperil
by
indiscreet
speech
the
footing
he
had
won
but
his
soul
had
been
moved
to
its
depths
to
be
false
and
with
her
have
not
told
you
all
can
tell
me
nothing
that
was
like
an
icy
wind
he
walked
on
they
came
to
a
jutting
crag
skirted
it
and
the
house
rose
radiant
in
the
hollow
of
the
cliff
he
had
an
aching
vision
of
their
living
there
together
she
and
he
with
all
the
dear
domesticities
of
wedded
union
his
fancy
feigned
them
now
their
joint
domain
the
pretence
left
his
heart
sick
and
empty
they
walked
across
the
lawn
would
not
call
me
noble
he
said
coming
to
an
abrupt
you
knew
that
i
he
flinched
under
the
sceptical
confident
smile
she
threw
over
her
shoulder
i
am
the
smile
faded
from
the
beautiful
face
and
with
it
the
color
she
turned
her
head
again
towards
the
house
but
she
was
not
moving
forward
he
was
glad
he
had
not
to
meet
her
eyes
the
sea
broke
solemnly
with
a
fused
roar
of
irregular
waves
and
he
wondered
why
the
sound
was
so
continuous
a
chirp
in
the
seemed
to
him
extraordinarily
loud
he
looked
up
at
the
stars
were
the
tears
indeed
wiped
from
all
eyes
in
those
shining
islands
he
thought
or
were
they
only
dead
lonely
worlds
or
were
they
alive
and
full
of
unhappy
people
like
the
star
he
stood
on
she
spoke
at
last
with
a
catch
in
her
breath
and
a
strained
smile
in
her
voice
should
that
make
me
think
less
of
you
he
caught
only
the
celestial
reassurance
of
her
reply
how
fine
how
sympathetic
she
was
but
he
hastened
to
immolate
himself
her
unexpected
question
had
thrown
him
off
the
track
he
forgot
that
his
of
his
marriage
was
the
only
circumstance
for
which
he
had
foreseen
the
blame
and
he
answered
desperately
i
married
for
money
she
repeated
in
a
toneless
voice
he
was
cold
and
sick
with
shame
despite
her
experience
of
the
coarser
side
of
life
such
a
contingency
was
he
felt
quite
beyond
her
comprehension
that
money
played
no
part
in
her
consciousness
he
would
have
divined
even
if
her
friend
had
not
informed
him
of
the
fact
in
their
first
talk
an
impulse
had
driven
him
to
humble
himself
a
now
spurred
him
to
excuse
himself
was
to
pursue
my
art
career
he
said
deprecatingly
even
now
he
would
not
speak
of
the
younger
children
he
had
had
to
support
she
turned
her
head
again
and
the
smile
was
struggling
back
and
her
voice
had
an
echo
of
the
old
enthusiastic
ring
you
married
for
art
not
for
money
do
not
comfort
me
my
god
how
i
am
punished
she
veered
round
now
her
tones
were
low
and
trembling
with
compassion
she
a
bad
woman
is
worse
she
is
a
good
woman
all
her
thoughts
are
on
the
household
it
is
unbearable
never
a
thought
of
anything
but
the
kitchen
and
woman
she
said
the
prisoned
sobs
could
hardly
be
choked
back
now
world
does
not
know
i
have
been
ashamed
of
her
now
you
see
how
low
i
am
you
can
not
respect
her
voice
was
almost
a
whisper
respect
you
the
more
for
what
you
have
done
in
despite
of
her
you
have
had
a
hard
have
i
not
and
a
sob
escaped
at
last
yourself
we
must
go
will
be
my
friend
all
the
same
i
will
be
your
friend
your
confidences
are
safe
in
my
keeping
there
is
my
he
took
it
again
and
held
it
fast
feeling
its
warm
response
make
me
so
happy
life
will
not
be
empty
he
struggled
with
the
lump
in
his
throat
your
friendship
what
can
i
not
achieve
you
shall
tell
me
what
i
am
to
strive
is
too
great
a
responsibility
it
was
all
very
well
to
criticise
i
know
what
to
need
say
nothing
i
shall
look
into
your
eyes
and
read
it
he
looked
into
them
now
and
they
were
not
lowered
they
were
full
of
sympathetic
sweetness
glistening
behind
tears
am
afraid
they
are
rather
red
she
said
with
a
melancholy
smile
i
am
not
careful
they
may
betray
your
she
moved
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
water
and
he
turning
on
his
heel
followed
wondering
by
a
salt
pool
near
the
rim
of
the
billows
she
bent
down
and
bathed
her
face
to
see
her
half
kneeling
in
the
moonlight
affected
him
like
reading
poetry
and
as
she
washed
off
the
traces
of
the
tears
he
had
made
her
shed
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
their
spiritual
friendship
were
being
consecrated
by
some
mystic
baptism
they
went
in
olive
had
not
moved
from
her
indolent
attitude
in
the
chair
herbert
was
standing
at
the
so
glad
come
in
she
said
yawning
herbert
has
been
sulking
at
having
been
left
behind
and
i
have
been
snapping
his
head
off
for
not
leaving
me
to
miss
regan
speaks
the
truth
for
once
said
herbert
audaciously
i
am
glad
primitiva
is
not
here
to
have
her
ideal
shattered
before
you
get
he
responded
you
get
care
of
him
matthew
he
is
irresponsible
go
by
the
cliff
miss
regan
and
that
dear
secret
pressure
thrilled
his
palm
again
in
a
few
moments
the
two
cousins
were
marching
with
measured
step
along
the
winding
road
herbert
had
lit
a
cigar
but
matthew
was
busy
enough
chewing
the
cud
of
his
memories
was
rather
strange
said
herbert
breaking
the
silence
of
the
more
than
usual
surely
answered
matthew
your
conventionality
and
your
ignorance
of
women
i
never
found
her
strange
except
with
her
nonsense
about
the
pain
of
the
talked
to
me
like
that
before
several
times
she
thinks
people
with
souls
be
happy
i
suppose
influence
over
her
natural
perhaps
so
but
why
so
formal
matt
you
have
my
permission
to
call
her
you
said
matthew
with
a
forced
smile
hope
you
enjoyed
your
more
than
i
did
not
that
there
a
certain
fascination
in
sparring
but
perhaps
you
fought
he
returned
a
staccato
after
a
silence
accentuated
by
the
tramp
tramp
of
their
automatic
feet
as
they
swung
along
he
said
told
her
i
was
herbert
gave
a
long
whistle
devil
you
did
and
you
call
that
fighting
what
a
blow
do
you
mean
matthew
murmured
you
mean
to
say
you
know
the
woman
is
in
love
with
you
blood
made
delicious
riot
in
his
veins
he
saw
that
strange
look
of
worship
in
her
eyes
again
he
jerked
thickly
honorable
wyndwood
in
love
with
me
say
the
honorable
wyndwood
i
said
the
woman
trust
me
behind
all
the
titles
and
the
purple
and
the
fine
linen
flesh
and
is
impossible
in
love
with
may
well
be
astonished
you
duffer
to
fix
her
affections
on
you
with
me
in
the
neighborhood
but
women
were
always
strange
and
men
were
deceivers
the
more
reason
i
deceive
her
how
glad
i
am
i
told
her
the
truth
i
breathe
easier
a
weight
off
my
selfish
beggar
and
now
all
over
between
you
i
suppose
and
our
nice
little
constitutional
quartette
is
broken
up
and
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
so
jolly
when
you
came
down
heigho
be
afraid
said
matthew
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
wyndwood
and
i
are
going
to
be
better
friends
than
ever
thank
god
whom
be
god
repeated
matthew
firmly
well
you
were
always
a
methodist
parson
but
if
i
were
a
jew
i
say
grace
over
pork
not
a
bad
epigram
that
i
must
get
it
into
my
matthew
shuddered
tone
was
desecrating
understand
he
said
plume
yourself
on
your
superior
intelligence
old
man
quite
equal
to
the
study
of
plato
it
such
greek
to
me
as
you
whatever
you
think
you
are
quite
wrong
he
replied
with
spirit
friendship
is
on
a
different
plane
it
is
based
on
our
common
interest
in
art
and
not
the
sort
of
woman
had
experience
cool
how
do
you
know
what
sort
of
women
had
experience
of
besides
a
woman
is
a
woman
the
world
our
world
that
is
is
full
of
greek
scholars
who
study
plato
strictly
under
the
rose
society
is
only
an
incarnate
should
put
that
into
the
comedy
sneered
matthew
a
quotation
from
it
laughed
herbert
you
there
my
it
nearly
came
to
a
quarrel
but
herbert
said
he
must
save
matthew
from
himself
and
he
fervently
hoped
his
cousin
would
not
confide
in
any
more
women
syndicate
a
secret
he
said
sternly
at
the
house
they
had
left
things
were
equally
disturbed
wyndwood
retired
at
once
to
bed
throwing
herself
upon
it
in
her
clothes
and
her
delicate
white
shoulders
which
like
her
emotions
had
no
need
to
be
covered
up
now
rose
and
fell
spasmodically
after
a
while
she
got
up
bathed
her
eyes
again
in
fresh
water
this
time
and
went
into
room
miss
regan
was
brushing
her
dusky
tresses
savagely
she
had
sent
her
maid
to
bed
hours
she
growled
catch
cold
dear
eleanor
replied
gently
for
a
window
was
wide
open
at
the
bottom
nor
said
olive
petulantly
should
like
to
sleep
on
the
in
this
costume
bathes
in
less
still
while
here
she
closed
the
window
with
a
bang
you
make
my
heart
not
a
wyndwood
colored
painfully
then
looked
at
her
with
brimming
eyes
of
reproach
this
is
my
reward
for
leaving
you
i
thought
that
was
a
wyndwood
controlled
her
vexation
said
just
now
i
had
never
known
any
one
so
easy
to
live
with
make
me
change
my
opinion
been
discussing
me
with
matthew
and
what
right
have
you
to
discuss
me
with
anybody
oh
how
hateful
everybody
is
i
know
what
it
is
like
to
see
me
brought
down
to
your
miss
regan
you
will
apologize
in
the
glare
the
level
of
womanhood
if
you
like
loved
a
face
flushed
is
the
height
of
womanhood
yes
fine
phrases
the
height
of
womanhood
she
drew
a
comb
fiercely
through
her
hair
hang
on
a
lips
to
feel
a
foolish
sense
of
blankness
when
he
there
and
a
great
wave
of
joyful
pain
when
he
heaves
in
sight
again
to
kiss
his
every
little
note
to
think
of
him
and
your
trivial
self
as
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
to
want
the
planets
to
spin
for
your
joint
happiness
oh
she
pulled
the
comb
viciously
through
a
knot
describe
it
very
accurately
olive
said
her
friend
maliciously
quoting
the
novels
this
passion
that
they
crack
up
so
much
seems
nothing
more
than
selfishness
at
compound
when
you
yourself
say
it
makes
you
yearn
for
the
other
that
it
may
subserve
are
a
is
a
cynic
an
accurate
observer
of
life
oh
you
smile
i
know
quoting
but
one
put
quotation
marks
into
conversation
you
face
the
facts
of
life
nor
you
like
dull
people
without
like
too
cheap
you
like
socialists
and
spiritualists
and
poets
and
painters
the
whole
spawn
of
idealists
bah
they
ought
to
have
a
experience
of
a
world
a
hospital
ward
olive
the
people
i
like
have
the
truer
insight
has
your
matthew
strang
is
as
much
yours
as
shuffle
out
of
the
insight
expresses
itself
through
his
work
he
that
a
hit
at
his
cousin
queried
olive
savagely
so
it
falls
remarkably
flat
considering
herbert
strang
paints
as
well
as
why
will
you
put
words
into
my
mouth
you
know
how
much
i
admire
herbert
then
you
have
more
insight
than
i
gave
you
credit
for
you
may
even
understand
that
a
cynic
is
only
a
disappointed
idealist
a
saint
plus
insight
his
soul
is
a
palace
of
truth
society
and
its
shams
come
to
the
test
yield
up
their
implicit
falseness
and
are
scornfully
rejected
the
stroke
of
wit
is
made
with
the
sword
of
judgment
its
shaft
is
the
lightning
of
righteous
wyndwood
felt
this
might
pass
well
enough
for
an
analysis
of
own
cynicism
but
she
had
her
doubts
as
to
its
applicability
to
olive
puzzled
her
frequently
and
shocked
her
not
seldom
but
she
felt
instinctively
that
hers
were
the
aberrations
of
a
noble
nature
while
the
cynicisms
of
herbert
jarred
upon
her
without
such
reassurance
of
sweet
bells
jangled
not
that
she
doubted
but
that
he
too
was
much
more
idealistic
than
he
made
himself
out
did
he
not
write
charming
comedy
still
he
was
a
man
who
had
seen
the
world
not
a
crude
girl
like
olive
and
in
the
face
of
affectionate
analysis
of
herbert
which
she
rightly
divined
owed
less
to
reason
than
to
the
growing
love
for
him
which
she
had
long
suspected
in
her
turbulent
friend
eleanor
felt
vaguely
that
while
jarring
notes
may
be
struck
from
the
soundest
keyboard
they
may
also
be
the
index
of
an
instrument
hopelessly
out
of
tune
of
course
herbert
was
not
that
she
was
sure
he
lacked
idealism
and
manly
beauty
but
he
was
handsome
too
in
his
daintier
way
and
charming
and
gifted
and
probably
the
very
husband
to
put
an
end
to
psychical
all
this
mixture
of
acute
and
feeble
insight
occupied
consciousness
but
all
she
said
was
that
emerson
me
now
go
to
bed
and
sleep
on
i
sleep
on
anything
so
hard
dear
me
what
a
lot
of
you

what
nice
ones
i
must
borrow
them
all
and
shall
blow
out
the
candles

cajolingly
exquisite

you

everything
from

your

he
has
at

the
family
idealism
the
strang
goodness
though
he
carries
it
so
much
more
heavily
than
his
cousin
but
a
lifetime
with
a
dull
man
who

who
would

hypocrite
oh
ye

one
i
used
to
say
in

lord
i
beseech
thee
let
not
this
be
counted
unto
me
for
righteousness
for
thou
knowest
o
lord
that
i
help
but
not
applicable
now
suppose
i
say
just
in
my
heart
as
the
theologians
she
went
down
on
her
knees
and
said
solemnly
lord
you
think
you
are
sometimes
a
little
hard
upon
us
you
think
we
are
born
into
a
very
confusing
world
it
would
be
so
easy
to
do
thy
will
to
make
thy
will
our
will
if
we
only
knew
what
it
was
you
think
that
half
our
life
that
might
be
devoted
to
thy
service
is
wasted
because
of
the
mist
through
which
we
grope
bearing
the
offering
of
our
life
in
quest
of
we
know
not
what
divine
altar
and
blurring
the
road
more
thickly
with
our
tears
she
sprang
up
that
for
an
addition
to
the
liturgy
nor
am
disgusted
said
wyndwood
sternly
blasphemous
olive
threw
herself
back
on
the
bed
laughing
unrestrainedly
delightful
stupid
old
thing
ha
ha
ha
blasphemous
ungrammatical
you
dissenting
hellenist
sacrilege
and

ha
ha

no
you

you
must
abide
the
question
tell
me
o
friend
of
my
soul
why
do
women
who
have
been
unhappily
married
want
to
see
other
women
victimized
equally
like
people
who
have
been
fooled
in
a
penny
show
and
come
out
laughing
to
beguile
the
other
people
not
a
fair
analogy
said
eleanor
more
gently
olive
looked
up
archly
her
arms
under
her
head
perhaps
not
in
your
case
i
dare
say
quite
capable

she
said
solemnly
there
was
an
of
and
her
eyes
were
moist
she
turned
hastily
and
walked
from
the
room
with
a
firm
stately
step
olive
watched
the
sweep
of
the
gown
till
it
reached
the
door
then
she
gave
chase
and
renewed
her
apologies
and
let
eleanor
sob
out
sweet
reconciliation
on
her
shoulder
after
which
she
opened
the
window
sat
on

side

chapter
vii
the
idyl
concludes
they
fleeted
the
days
delightfully
as
men
did
in
the
golden
world
they
rode
together
on
the
rolling
moors
they
drove
through
the
devonshire
lanes
they
strolled
through
combe
and
copse
they
climbed
the
tors
they
fished
the
leys
they
swam
in
the
sea
and
when
it
was
cloudy
and
cold
and
the
wind
wailed
about
the
house
like
a
woman
in
pain
they
listened
to
the
comedy
which
herbert
wrote
in
those
dreary
days
when
the
ladies
drove
off
to
distant
houses
for
lunch
or
tennis
or
croquet
for
they
had
not
quite
hidden
their
retreat
or
detached
themselves
from
their
kind
always
scandal
within
a
radius
as
miss
regan
put
it
there
on
earth
a
greater
piece
of
philanthropy
than
to
give
your
neighbors
food
for
gossip
man
can
not
live
by
bread
matthew
asked
her
in
concern
if
his
and
visits
were
causing
any
talk
dear
matthew
she
replied
scornfully
an
actress
can
not
escape
scandal
especially
if
she
goes
into
society
and
truly
society
is
so
corrupt
i
have
often
wondered
that
mothers
allow
them
to
go
into
it
during
one
of
these
absences
of
the
feminine
element
when
herbert
went
over
to
the
house
to
put
the
last
touches
to
the
painted
costume
grumbling
at
the
boredom
of
such
finicking
work
matthew
gladly
relieved
him
of
the
brush
and
worked
up
the
whole
portrait
while
herbert
lay
smoking
and
thinking
out
the
comedy
partly
out
of
bravado
partly
to
enjoy
the
series
of
lovely
views
of
sea
and
broken
crags
and
nestling
villages
the
cousins
invariably
arrived
by
the
seeing
the
blackberries
get
riper
every
day
sometimes
they
found
the
ladies
sitting
reading
on
the
top
of
the
cliff
which
was
furzy
with
a
border
of
hemlock
and
dandelions
and
blue
orchids
amid
which
their
dainty
parasols
showed
from
afar
like
gigantic
tropical
flowers
then
while
matthew
drowsed
in
the
light
of
the
sun
and
of
eleanor
inhaling
the
odors
of
bracken
and
thyme
lazily
watching
the
white
surf
break
far
below
the
brown
trawlers
glide
across
the
horizon
the
swallows
swarm
on
the
beach
and
the
wild
ducks
over
the
sea
herbert
and
olive
would
rattle
away
by
the
hour
often
in
verbal
duels
matthew
strang
thought
he
had
never
tasted
such
pure
intellectual
joy
art
was
often
on
the
tapis
they
classified
the
skies
a
constable
and
yesterday
a
turner
and
a
corot
herbert
expounded
glibly
to
the
rapt
eleanor
the
continental
ideas
descanting
on
manet
and
monet
nature
lay
all
around
them
like
a
model
to
illustrate
these
theories
and
eleanor
discovered
all
sorts
of
shadows
and
subtle
effects
she
had
never
noticed
before
all
with
the
naïve
joy
of
a
child
lighting
on
pretty
treasures
she
cried
out
that
art
taught
people
to
see
nature
and
the
impressionists
were
right
look
over
there
you
tell
whether
it
was
a
pool
or
a
pile
of
fish
and
the
colors
of
things
changed
incessantly
matthew
would
sometimes
put
in
a
word
when
appealed
to
by
her
but
never
when
the
subject
was
music
concerning
which
he
was
as
ignorant
as
the
rest
of
the
party
was
learned
once
herbert
maintained
that
the
musician
was
better
off
than
the
painter
because
his
work
remained
while
pictures
perished
destroyed
by
the
aniline
and
bitumen
in
their
own
colors
mona
smile
will
fade
he
said
artist
lingers
a
little
longer
on
the
stage
than
the
actor
pictures
are
but
paltry
things
at
best
and
few
artists
have
brains
or
any
large
outlook
upon
life
a
petty
quarrelsome
matthew
did
not
deny
it
olive
cited
sculpture
as
a
more
durable
art
than
the
which
only
lived
when
performed
wyndwood
was
convinced
that
the
joy
of
art
must
be
to
the
artist
she
said
she
was
fast
acquiring
a
keen
interest
in
the
subjective
side
of
art
and
feeling
a
growing
desire
to
be
an
artist
herself
the
spiritual
was
all
very
well
but
it
needed
to
be
expressed
through
the
beautiful
olive
playfully
suggested
an
expedition
to
the
latin
quarter
wyndwood
accepted
it
seriously
and
eagerly
she
returned
to
the
idea
again
and
again
both
in
public
and
in
private
why
should
they
not
go
to
paris
for
the
winter
and
olive
take
up
sculpture
again
and
initiate
her
into
the
divine
mysteries
to
judge
by
the
strangs
artists
must
be
delightful
creatures
to
live
among
and
sculpture
seemed
easier
and
simpler
than
painting
olive
continued
to
play
with
the
project
herbert
sneered
at
the
idea
of
miss
return
to
the
plaster
of
paris
literature
was
after
all
the
only
art
he
said
it
contained
everything
music
of
words
painting
of
scenery
passion
of
drama
he
almost
converted
wyndwood
she
quoted
ecstatically
a
été
fait
pour
aboutir
à
un
beau
but
a
word
from
matthew
restored
the
balance
they
talked
of
life
too
of
fate
and
knowledge
absolute
like
archangels
herbert
as
lucifer
steadfastly
took
the
lowest
views
of
human
nature
now
and
then
eye
twinkling
with
fun
met
his
as
if
in
a
secret
understanding
that
wyndwood
must
be
shocked
at
all
hazards
he
fought
for
the
doctrine
that
sin
was
a
human
invention
people
have
their
fling
they
exaggerate
their
powers
of
sinning
they
think
they
can
draw
on
a
boundless
internal
reservoir
of
wickedness
as
a
matter
of
fact
their
powers
are
singularly
limited
they
have
too
much
original
goodness
for
my
part
alas
i
have
found
few
opportunities
of
have
you
never
found
opportunities
for
remorse
wyndwood
asked
scathingly
often
i
tell
you
remorse
for
the
sins
i
do
the
remorse
of
your
religious
person
is
too
often
like
the
snivelling
repentance
of
the
condemned
criminal
that
murderer
felt
a
truer
remorse
who
was
unexpectedly
reprieved
after
indulging
in
an
indigestible
olive
laughed
heartily
must
go
into
the
it
had
become
their
stock
phrase
then
remembering
her
part
in
the
comedy
was
to
score
off
herbert
she
capped
his
anecdote
of
the
condemned
criminal
by
another
about
the
politeness
of
a
frenchman
who
ascending
the
scaffold
said
to
his
neighbor
in
the
tumbril
eleanor
raised
the
talk
to
a
more
elevated
plane
insisting
on
the
value
of
remorse
and
of
suffering
generally
would
not
recall
one
of
my
sufferings
said
she
with
her
simple
earnestness
i
suffer
i
think
i
had
and
her
eyes
instinctively
sought
and
he
thought
she
was
reminding
him
of
the
educative
efficacy
of
his
own
sufferings
as
well
and
again
philosophy
jarred
and
whatever
she
was
saying
or
doing
she
always
fell
naturally
into
some
attitude
that
enchanted
his
eye
by
its
unaffected
grace
always
wore
an
expression
whose
sweetness
and
candor
softened
him
in
worship
her
beauty
to
a
soul
the
miracle
of
miracles
she
wore
with
a
royal
unconsciousness
he
could
not
understand
it
she
was
so
simple
just
like
a
human
being
he
saw
her
not
in
her
society
drapings
but
in
all
moods
and
weathers
and
she
bore
the
test
on
fishing
days
they
would
draw
up
the
boat
in
the
centre
of
the
nearest
ley
where
perch
and
abounded
the
former
avid
of
the
gentles
the
latter
only
less
eager
for
the
paste
but
demanding
an
iota
of
skill
when
hooked
olive
would
take
no
hand
in
this
mild
sport
she
had
given
up
hunting
and
fishing
she
said
when
she
rose
in
the
ethical
scale
challenged
as
to
her
readiness
to
eat
meat
and
fish
she
failed
to
see
the
relevancy
of
the
criticism
the
reason
she
kill
other
creatures
was
not
that
it
gave
them
pain
but
that
it
gave
her
pain
to
eat
them
on
the
contrary
gave
her
pleasure
wyndwood
however
though
not
callous
enough
to
impale
her
own
worms
was
persuaded
by
matthew
to
take
a
rod
and
beguiled
numbers
of
perch
and
admitted
to
a
thrill
of
savage
joy
each
time
she
hauled
up
a
leaping
flash
of
silver
she
was
glad
though
she
said
that
the
poor
little
fishes
had
horny
membranes
for
gills
so
that
the
hook
should
not
hurt
them
when
it
passed
through
the
eye
she
trusted
that
the
cornea
was
insensitive
too
how
would
you
feel
olive
once
remonstrated
sitting
at
dinner
just
after
swallowing
a
mouthful
of
mayonnaise
and
in
the
middle
of
a
remark
to
your
neighbor
about
the
rhine
or
the
you
were
suddenly
to
find
yourself
rising
towards
the
ceiling
at
the
end
of
a
rope
fixed
by
a
hook
to
your
upper
lip
and
arriving
slowly
but
surely
despite
your
kicking
and
writhing
into
a
stratum
of
air
totally
devoid
of
oxygen
herbert
strang
thought
one
would
feel
like
a
fish
out
of
water
but
matthew
strang
eluded
the
point
by
drawing
a
pike
across
the
track
the
bait
of
a
captured
roach
had
fetched
the
monster
whose
struggles
interested
even
olive
while
eleanor
was
wrought
up
to
a
wild
enthusiasm
for
prowess
and
regretted
that
in
scotland
she
had
always
refused
to
go
to
see
the
hear
they
are
doing
badly
this
year
olive
observed
no
olive
cried
wyndwood
we
hear
at
the
yesterday
that
they
were
making
excellent
bags
meant
the
birds
said
olive
dryly
the
birds
i
should
love
to
be
a
sportsman
cried
eleanor
exultantly
landing
her
eleventh
perch
they
trooped
like
children
to
the
can
see
how
fascinating
it
must
be
to
actually
the
struggle
for
existence
it
brings
you
back
to
the
primitive
you
touch
reality
you
remember
an
always
reminds
me
sufficiently
of
that
said
olive
eleanor
argued
napery
and
the
flowers
come
between
us
and
the
facts
how
glorious
it
would
be
to
be
primitive
between
art
and
sport
with
that
charming
impressionability
of
hers
she
had
drifted
as
far
from
the
spiritualities
of
dolkovitch
as
under
the
influence
from
the
socialism
of
gerard
brode
herbert
whose
skill
with
the
rod
was
not
remarkable
diverged
into
an
account
of
his
stay
in
a
servian
which
was
entirely
primitive
primitive
he
said
laughing
the
wives
do
most
of
the
he
sketched
the
place
with
admirable
literary
touches
is
their
only
wear
he
wound
up
the
winter
they
wear
the
wool
outside
in
the
summer
they
take
off
their
skins
and
no
not
sit
in
their
bones
as
miss
regan
is
about
to
remark
but
wear
the
wool
matthew
was
thus
led
on
to
relate
juvenile
sporting
experiences
on
the
shores
of
the
bay
of
fundy
and
finally
his
one
encounter
with
a
bear
in
the
cobequid
forest
which
put
the
seal
on
ardor
for
sport
this
tame
of
perch
palled
they
must
go
she
insisted
and
so
matthew
strang
arranged
with
a
fisherman
to
go
out
to
sea
in
his
boat
next
day
but
the
sea
ran
high
and
to
the
undisguised
relief
of
herbert
who
felt
himself
rather
cut
out
by
his
cousin
in
these
unliterary
expeditions
primitiva
arrived
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
with
a
note
from
wyndwood
saying
she
had
forgotten
the
at
colonel
to
inaugurate
the
season
of
the
local
pack
and
she
would
ride
over
to
that
in
the
hope
of
catching
sight
of
a
bit
of
the
hunt
there
was
a
postscript
from
olive
saying
of
course
i
must
go
to
chaperon
her
among
all
those
nevertheless
they
went
out
in
the
boat
late
that
same
afternoon
when
the
ocean
was
calm
again
and
quivering
in
the
sun
their
course
lay
along
a
track
of
diamonds
which
seemed
to
dance
off
the
water
like
a
million
elves
of
light
by
the
time
they
returned
the
path
of
diamonds
had
changed
to
one
of
red
gold
delicious
was
the
ripping
sound
of
the
living
boat
tearing
the
water
as
it
dipped
gently
from
side
to
side
its
white
sail
bellying
gracefully
the
sunset
was
strange
one
dull
red
narrow
bar
crowned
by
a
ball
of
molten
gold
radiating
four
hazy
spokes
like
the
ball
gradually
sank
in
the
sea
in
the
south
the
white
sickle
of
the
moon
grew
yellower
and
yellower
in
the
east
fleecy
strips
of
cloud
reflected
the
dying
day
the
colors
of
the
cliffs
still
stood
out
vivid
the
moment
was
poetic
the
air
was
charged
with
amorous
electricity
the
talk
drifted
into
love
and
marriage
they
played
with
the
subject
skimming
it
gracefully
touching
it
with
subtle
lights
flashed
and
withdrawn
shooting
out
audacities
with
ingenuous
impersonality
all
four
the
while
tingling
with
from
crown
to
sole
herbert
said
that
to
a
woman
love
is
a
complete
romance
to
a
man
a
collection
of
short
stories
olive
maintained
that
the
reverse
was
true
if
man
knew
woman
she
cried
you
who
pretend
to
write
comedies
wyndwood
admitted
that
byron
was
right
about
love
being
all
in
all
to
a
woman
of
unmarried
women
she
said
looking
at
herbert
never
had
a
of
married
women
more
likely
olive
flashed
back
in
opinion
marriage
was
a
failure
wyndwood
sadly
acquiesced
they
sought
the
remedy
may
be
a
failure
but
not
friendship
olive
pronounced
now
it
was
eyes
that
sought
and
his
involuntarily
met
hers
there
was
exaltation
in
this
secret
glance
and
mutual
reassurance
pursued
olive
friendship
is
contracted
between
persons
of
different
eyes
drooped
then
opened
full
again
to
note
how
matthew
took
the
addendum
the
friends
perceived
themselves
reddening
in
simultaneous
confession
that
olive
was
not
so
very
wrong
an
indefinable
expression
half
abashment
half
radiance
flickered
over
features
her
glance
swift
probing
challenging
dazzled
him
his
whole
frame
trembled
at
the
thought
that
this
heavenly
creature
could
love
him
then
he
grew
chill
again
for
she
cried
as
in
the
highest
spirits
look
at
the
sun
how
comic
it
had
indeed
become
a
face
swollen
and
bulbous
and
crossed
with
red
bars
the
talk
went
on
to
rights
and
matthew
mentioned
that
he
had
an
indirect
relation
to
the
subject
because
a
girl
he
used
to
know
in
childhood
had
become
linda
secretary
she
pretty
wyndwood
asked
know
never
seen
you
said
you
used
to
know
you
mean
ruth
hailey
she
used
to
be
pretty
but
my
brother
tells
me
gone
you
seen
her
yourself
not
for
sent
verder
a
subscription
some
few
years
ago
said
wyndwood
i
have
ceased
to
believe
in
rights
are
a
husband
and
children
said
herbert
with
his
eye
fixed
on
olive
is
a
mistake
for
the
movement
to
be
led
by
women
pursued
wyndwood
was
that
why
you
resigned
when
lord
boscombe
left
the
council
asked
olive
innocently
eleanor
looked
annoyed
mean
wyndwood
matthew
hastened
to
say
they
lay
themselves
open
to
the
imputation
of
being
soured
she
replied
they
are
crying
for
the
the
man
in
it
muttered
olive
ungenerous
to
your
sisters
said
eleanor
demand
generosity
olive
retorted
are
all
in
the
same
and
she
smiled
audaciously
at
herbert
verder
take
up
with
this
movement
till
she
lost
her
husband
and
wager
this
ruth
bailey
is
an
old
hailey
corrected
matthew
flushing
painfully
he
scarcely
knew
why
perhaps
from
sympathy
with
the
aspersed
friend
of
his
childhood
unmarried
but
i
am
quite
sure
it
must
be
from
her
own
choice
for
she
is
very
said
she
said
wyndwood
quickly
he
laughed
confusedly
was
thinking
of
the
the
subject
dropped
ere
they
got
in
the
wind
freshened
and
matthew
was
busy
with
the
sheet
and
now
a
proposition
was
broached
which
promised
to
bring
a
new
sensation
into
their
comparatively
sequestered
existence
discussions
as
to
what
they
would
do
in
the
event
of
capsizing
through
mishandling
of
the
sail
led
to
estimates
of
the
distance
they
could
swim
in
their
clothes
wyndwood
could
not
swim
at
all
and
complained
of
the
abrupt
shelving
of
the
beach
which
gave
her
only
a
few
feet
of
splashing
room
while
olive
was
sailing
gloriously
off
in
search
of
the
horizon
herbert
said
that
like
the
man
who
was
asked
if
he
could
play
the
violin
he
know
if
he
could
swim
in
his
clothes
because
he
had
never
tried
and
besides
he
had
his
comedy
in
his
pocket
which
was
heavy
enough
to
drag
down
a
theatre
olive
said
she
see
that
it
made
any
difference
whether
a
lady
swam
in
her
clothes
or
not
especially
if
she
was
in
evening
dress
she
claimed
that
the
cap
and
gown
worn
in
the
water
were
as
heavy
as
boating
flannels
the
upshot
of
the
discussion
was
that
miss
regan
challenged
matthew
strang
to
a
race
in
clothes
which
she
insisted
must
be
new
go
out
getting
capsized
in
old
clothes
she
contended
you
have
nor
a
coat
people
always
have
time
to
throw
them
off
in
books
i
shall
be
clothed
in
a
new
yachting
costume
superficially
of
course
to
counteract
your
sheddings
from
waste
remonstrated
eleanor
who
pretend
to
philanthropy
mocked
herbert
mimicking
her
intonation
of
who
pretend
to
write
comedies
to
learn
to
save
my
life
and
you
see
i
shall
forthwith
give
away
the
spoiled
costume
to
a
poor
creature
who
would
never
otherwise
have
got
it
and
olive
who
was
quite
serious
fell
to
elaborating
a
facetious
programme
of
creamery
the
regatta
day
duly
arrived
two
bathing
tents
were
erected
on
the
beach
and
decorated
with
flags
it
was
arranged
that
the
competitors
should
swim
out
leisurely
together
as
far
as
they
cared
to
go
then
turn
and
race
for
shore
herbert
was
chosen
referee
he
offered
to
take
them
out
in
a
boat
and
then
accompany
them
back
as
a
precaution
but
olive
laughed
at
him
for
an
old
woman
eleanor
entering
enthusiastically
into
the
fun
had
ordered
a
silver
cup
from
london
and
was
to
present
it
to
the
winner
but
the
day
opened
badly
with
fitful
weather
a
gray
rain
and
thunder
and
lightning
they
waited
till
the
afternoon
when
the
sun
burst
out
in
sudden
fire
and
in
a
moment
the
great
stretch
of
gray
cloud
was
shrivelling
off
all
around
it
like
a
burned
cobweb
the
eager
combatants
dashed
into
their
and
emerging
as
lightly
clad
as
was
compatible
with
the
conditions
they
plunged
together
into
the
great
sapphire

yachting
costume
turned
out
to
be
a
pair
of
knickerbockers
and
a
jacket
rather
lighter
than
her
ordinary
bathing
costume
and
matthew
had
begged
off
his
waistcoat
and
was
only
hampered
by
a
white
flannel
shirt
and
trousers
the
outward
swim
was
an
ecstasy
the
water
was
warm
and
sparkling
with
patches
of
molten
silver
breaking
up
into
little
shining
circles
and
reuniting
it
sent
a
voluptuous
thrill
to
the
palms
to
cleave
its
buoyant
elasticity
and
the
forward
movement
of
the
body
was
a
rapture
drawing
in
the
balmy
air
with
joyous
breaths
matthew
felt
an
immense
gratitude
for
existence
there
was
exhilaration
in
the
mere
proximity
of
olive
with
her
lively
snatches
of
conversation
her
lovely
flushed
face
and
dripping
hair
went
with
him
like
a
the
same
thought
struck
her
for
she
began
to
sing
jerkily
with
her
beautiful
voice
snatches
of
ballad
schönste

sitzet
dort

wunderbar
ihr
geschmeide
blitzet

kämmt
ihr
but
you
got
golden
hair
the
man
laughed
joyously
farther
and
farther
they
swam
into
the
vast
shimmering
blue
and
ecstasy
made
the
pace
brisker
than
they
had
meditated
we
start
from
here
he
asked
at
last
not
yet
i
want
a
long
they
swam
on
the
brown
trawling
boats
loomed
plainer
in
the
offing
said
matthew
a
little
farther
he
turned
on
his
back
and
propelled
himself
gently
gazing
up
in
luxurious
content
at
the
great
circle
of
blue
sky
round
its
rim
olive
lying
on
her
side
paddled
lazily
a
little
ahead
is
delicious
she
called
back
make
no
difference
but
fancy
a
clothed
lorelei
and
she
began
to
sing
again
with
pauses
for
breath
schiffer
im
kleinen

ergreift

mit
wildem
weh
er
schaut
nicht
die
felsenriffe
er
schaut
nur

in

he
threw
the
reply
over
his
head
shall
lure
me
no
but
she
mocked
him
elated
by
the
glory
of
motion
and
witched
him
to
follow
her
till
the
shore
was
far
at
last
they
turned
trod
water
olive
cried
two
three
and
they
were
off
for
some
minutes
they
swam
side
by
side
olive
making
the
pace
and
matthew
finding
it
no
trouble
to
keep
up
with
it
at
last
she
made
a
spurt
and
shot
past
him
with
a
triumphant
taunt
he
allowed
her
to
enjoy
some
seconds
of
victory
then
came
up
and
forged
ahead
he
eased
off
and
she
overtook
him
he
spurted
and
she
flagged
he
let
her
come
up
again
and
she
came
up
with
a
sneer
resolved
to
damp
her
frolicsome
spirits
he
put
on
a
powerful
stroke
and
showed
her
a
clean
pair
of
heels
she
made
a
desperate
effort
and
drew
level
with
him
again
the
instinct
of
victory
was
now
aroused
in
the
painter
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
shore
and
settled
steadily
to
the
task
of
reaching
it
very
soon
olive
was
hopelessly
in
the
rear
he
still
heard
her
vague
cries
from
afar
at
last
they
died
away
entirely
he
turned
his
head
to
measure
the
interval
olive
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
his
heart
contracted
with
a
cold
sick
horror
he
raced
back
with
great
side
strokes
shouting
regan
miss
regan
holloa
the
great
sparkling
water
stretched
all
around
in
deadly
silent
bareness
suddenly
become
an
evil
enemy
he
hoped
desperately
she
was
only
swimming
under
water
for
speed
or
to
frighten
him
and
then
in
a
moment
her
head
popped
up
to
the
right
and
he
saw
from
the
exhausted
expression
of
the
face
and
the
spasmodic
struggles
of
the
limbs
that
she
had
really
gone
under
in
a
few
strokes
he
was
at
her
side
she
still
retained
sufficient
not
to
grab
at
him
he
supported
her
with
one
hand
then
with
the
rest
of
his
limbs
he
struck
out
stoutly
for
home
she
helping
him
with
feeble
movements
after
an
interval
of
weakness
and
humility
she
recovered
somewhat
and
smiled
faintly
you
follow
the
lorelei
she
spluttered
reproachfully
am
sorry
i
followed
her
so
far
he
said
ruefully
regarding
the
distant
shore
olive
struggled
for
breath
man
i
waited
down
there
for
you
but
i
gave
you
up
and
came
to
the
surface
she
essayed
sturdier
kicks
only
sank
once
he
said
you
hear
me
calling
you
to
come
heard
sounds
but
i
thought
they
were
to
hit
a
woman
when
down
but
i
shall
be
better
soon
i
hope
they
see
us
from
talk
you
brought
herbert
an
to
see
we
started
olive
gasped
indignantly
distinctly
remember
dare
you
set
up
your
memory
against
a
drowning
he
was
glad
to
find
her
like
herself
and
not
alarmed
her
strokes
were
getting
stronger
now
but
he
still
feared
for
the
consequences
if
she
should
suddenly
lose
her
nerve
did
you
think
of
when
you
sank
he
asked
lightly
to
make
her
think
the
danger
of
sinking
was
over
her
she
began
and
stopped
short
her
at
my
funeral
poor
nor
i
was
regretting
i
made
my
will
and
left
her
my
this
sounded
pure
nonsense
to
her
companion
think
i
can
go
by
myself
now
she
added
after
a
long
silence
you
so
much
for
the
use
of
your
are
quite
sure
he
said
anxiously
of
course
you
have
he
removed
his
arm
but
kept
watchfully
at
her
side
and
his
misgivings
were
justified
for
after
a
slow
twenty
yards
her
strokes
became
so
spent
and
irregular
that
he
came
to
her
assistance
again
and
she
accepted
his
support
with
a
wan
smile
this
soppy
clogging
costume
she
said
had
better
keep
your
breath
in
your
lungs
he
said
not
in
rebuke
but
in
hortation
inflate
myself
like
an
she
replied
humbly
am
so
sorry
to
be
such
a
and
she
turned
upon
her
back
and
paddled
feebly
in
silence
he
did
not
answer
for
his
own
nerve
was
giving
way
the
responsibility
weighed
more
than
the
burden
though
that
was
heavy
enough
with
the
double
weight
of
superadded
garments
he
had
a
spasm
of
sickening
apprehension
his
own
strokes
were
getting
jerkier
what
if
he
should
fail
to
reach
that
strip
of
beach
on
which
he
dimly
descried
two
agitated
figures
and
in
this
tense
terrible
moment
the
figures
were
blotted
out
he
saw
only
the
cliffs
in
the
background
and
the
white
overhead
and
he
was
a
boy
again
in
the
bay
of
fundy
swimming
in
his
clothes
for
dear
life
the
illusion
was
momentary
but
it
left
the
memory
a
sense
of
the
tragic
contrast
between
the
ardent
lad
dreaming
of
pictures
and
the
popular
london
painter
occupied
his
consciousness
while
his
limbs
moved
automatically
shoreward
then
he
remembered
that
of
the
two
who
had
struck
out
for
home
on
that
memorable
day
the
sailor
had
only
put
off
the
day
of
drowning
and
at
the
thought
that
ancient
dead
face
swam
up
again
in
front
of
him
oh
it
was
horrible
to
die
to
be
dragged
down
out
of
the
sunlight
to
leave
a
world
which
held
eleanor
wyndwood
what
would
become
of
her
she
would
live
to
forget
him
she
would
marry
another
man
would
hold
her
in
his
arms
another
man
oh
direful
thought
bitterer
than
death
there
was
no
need
for
his
death
ere
another
man
could
possess
her
she
was
only
his
friend
he
had
not
wanted
more
than
her
friendship
oh
ghastly
sneer
at
the
friendship
of
the
sexes
rang
in
his
brain
and
that
strange
intoxicating
expression
in
face
half
abashment
half
radiance
dispelled
the
vision
of
his
in
a
moment
of
delirium
his
lips
touched
her
warm
cheek
it
was
her
weight
that
was
on
his
arm
what
did
it
matter
if
they
had
a
gleam
of
happiness
he
and
eleanor
both
victims
of
an
unsatisfactory
world
was
not
the
great
shining
mocking
remorseless
sea
waiting
to
suck
him
down
indifferent
to
the
aspirations
and
agonizings
of
the
long
years
and
then
between
his
lips
and
hers
the
dead
stony
face
swam
up
again
and
he
turned
on
his
back
to
escape
it
and
found
unexpected
relief
in
the
more
reposeful
attitude
and
in
the
change
of
arm
involved
for
the
left
which
had
supported
olive
had
grown
numb
when
sufficiently
rested
he
turned
again
he
saw
with
a
thrill
of
joy
that
the
shore
was
perceptibly
nearer
there
were
more
than
two
figures
now
he
made
out
primitiva
and
the
old
cook
and
arm
was
round
waist
supporting
her
a
powerful
spurt
brought
him
within
clear
hearing
of
hail
i
come
out
olive
roused
herself
for
she
sang
out
lustily
race
is
right
came
the
joyous
reply
was
sure
matt
could
manage
it
i
spoil
his
chances
of
a
as
they
came
nearer
in
he
cheered
them
on
with
sportive
ejaculations
and
confounded
the
beach
because
there
a
single
boat
within
half
a
mile
when
the
couple
scrambled
on
shore
shaking
themselves
like
spaniels
wyndwood
dragged
more
heavily
on
sustaining
arm
and
he
saw
that
she
had
fainted
almost
at
the
same
instant
by
a
curious
coincidence
the
sun
upon
which
the
clouds
had
gradually
been
closing
in
again
disappeared
and
the
wail
of
the
wind
rang
wilder
round
the
cliffs
there
was
confusion
in
the
household
that
afternoon
wyndwood
soon
revived
but
had
to
be
put
to
bed
and
miss
regan
who
was
secretly
grateful
for
an
excitement
that
kept
her
from
assuming
the
invalid
herself
sat
with
her
the
men
hung
about
the
house
anxious
and
receiving
frequent
reassuring
bulletins
by
the
lips
of
primitiva
presently
those
pretty
lips
brought
them
an
invitation
to
stay
to
seven
dinner
when
wyndwood
would
try
to
come
down
to
present
the
cup
they
need
have
no
delicacy
about
the
larder
for
colonel
chesham
had
opportunely
sent
wyndwood
a
gift
of
grouse
they
galloped
over
the
cliffs
to
get
themselves
into
their
meantime
wyndwood
had
fallen
asleep
and
at
her
bedside
olive
regan
writhed
in
a
black
paroxysm
asking
herself
why
having
once
gone
down
she
had
wanted
to
come
up
again
the
hostesses
were
a
little
late
but
the
reunion
was
gay
beyond
all
precedent
the
last
trappings
of
ceremony
were
thrown
off
a
bohemian
merriment
reigned
regardless
of
the
liveried
menial
who
alone
sustained
the
dignity
of
the
wyndwood
looking
a
shade
paler
and
more
spiritual
but
no
whit
less
beautiful
than
her
wont
appeared
in
a
low
white
satin
gown
with
the
same
jewelled
butterfly
poised
at
the
bosom
as
on
the
night
when
matthew
had
met
her
at
the
academy
soirée
he
fancied
some
occult
significance
in
the
circumstance
olive
was
in
soft
green
that
harmonized
so
suavely
with
her
complexion
as
to
give
her
a
less
aggressive
air
than
when
she
wore
blue
there
was
a
fragrant
with
a
sprig
of
fern
at
her
throat
and
the
table
was
gay
with
many
choice
specimens
of
aster
and
hydrangea
presents
from
father
outside
the
roar
of
the
sea
and
the
wail
of
the
wind
emphasized
the
charm
and
comfort
of
the
interior
and
the
gladness
of
being
alive
there
was
a
wavering
flush
on
cheek
and
a
shining
moisture
in
her
eye
as
before
they
sat
down
she
presented
matthew
with
the
cup
which
olive
complained
had
been
dashed
from
her
lips
interrogated
as
to
her
sensations
she
said
she
had
a
horrible
feeling
of
littleness
in
the
midst
of
the
great
churn
of
waters
and
under
the
naked
sky
it
did
not
seem
the
same
sea
she
had
been
bestriding
so
recklessly
and
voluptuously
she
seemed
to
herself
absolutely
unimportant
a
mere
atom
in
the
blind
wash
of
the
waves
a
straw
they
would
engulf
drift
or
disgorge
with
equal
indifference
it
was
this
thought
that
suddenly
paralyzed
her
and
made
her
give
up
and
go
under
when
she
came
up
something
not
herself
made
her
strain
every
sinew
to
keep
afloat
not
ourselves
that
makes
for
life
said
herbert
she
smiled
last
thought
was
of
you
she
said
audaciously
determined
to
send
you
a
message
by
submarine
had
the
greatest
ado
to
prevent
primitiva
stripping
and
going
out
to
fetch
you
in
he
rejoined
laughing
the
incidents
of
the
regatta
continued
to
afford
amusement
from
the
to
the
dessert
at
the
fish
olive
sprang
up
suddenly
and
rushed
to
the
window
her
exclamation
of
regatta
fireworks
drew
them
all
after
her
herbert
uttered
the
of
the
spectators
of
pyrotechnics
it
was
indeed
an
extraordinary
this
sunset
in
affinity
with
the
fitful
tempestuous
day
a
sky
again
with
great
broad
clouds
of
black
smoke
on
the
upper
rim
of
this
smoke
white
clouds
towards
the
horizon
over
the
inhabited
hills
a
lovely
light
and
on
the
right
of
that
a
monstrous
its
base
hidden
below
the
horizon
the
shadow
of
this
brilliant
cloud
darkening
to
a
purple
and
crimson
beauty
on
the
water
and
the
cloud
itself
infiltrating
its
pores
more
and
more
with
sulphur
and
deepening
momently
to
old
gold
over
the
green
light
patches
of
bright
gold
the
left
extremity
of
the
coming
to
meet
it
in
spots
of
smoky
red
every
little
pool
of
rain
or
brine
on
the
beach
crimsoning
and
purpling
in
responsive
radiance
they
returned
to
their
fish
but
watched
from
their
seats
till
the
beautiful
faded
into
a
pale
bluish
blot
wyndwood
observing
it
all
minutely
with
her
recently
acquired
artistic
vision
said
she
had
never
realized
before
how
many
editions
a
sunset
went
through
she
wondered
how
artists
arrested
it
long
enough
to
paint
it
herbert
said
sunsets
were
not
fixed
but
faked
he
resumed
his
badinage
of
olive
for
her
failure
to
see
her
whole
life
defile
pictorially
before
her
and
she
apologized
for
her
forgetfulness
on
the
ground
that
she
arrived
at
drowning
point
a
discussion
on
memory
ensued
wyndwood
acknowledged
possessing
a
good
verbal
memory
especially
for
poetry
herbert
said
that
he
could
only
remember
ideas
so
that
he
carried
away
nothing
from
contemporary
literature
only
the
continentals
had
ideas
the
english
were
a
wooden
race
wooden
heads
of
old
england
he
said
derisively
he
was
glad
of
his
infusion
of
french
blood
there
was
no
salt
in
english
life
nothing
but
putrefying
puritanism
olive
said
although
she
was
a
celt
she
could
remember
neither
ideas
nor
words
herbert
asked
what
was
her
earliest
recollection
after
screwing
up
her
forehead
in
earnest
effort
she
replied
honestly
forget
and
he
cried
wyndwood
proffered
her
own
earliest
recollection
of
gliding
in
her
arms
in
a
gondola
with
a
boatman
crying
and
was
curious
to
know
he
replied
mirthfully
that
he
remember
and
covered
his
discomposure
with
champagne
he
could
not
expose
to
strangers
that
memory
of
his
mother
scolding
his
father
shrieking
vociferating
offering
to
throw
up
the
position
threatening
to
shoot
herself
even
wyndwood
would
never
know
that
no
one
would
ever
really
see
the
scars
on
his
soul
the
thought
of
her
now
babbling
harmlessly
saner
in
her
insanity
than
in
her
sanity
came
up
like
the
skeleton
at
the
feast
he
put
her
resolutely
outside
with
the
night
and
the
wind
that
wailed
like
a
woman
but
he
heard
them
moaning
the
pain
of
the
world
after
dinner
they
walked
along
the
shore
towards
the
neighboring
village
it
blew
half
a
gale
now
but
the
air
was
not
cold
and
the
ladies
took
only
wraps
the
quartette
looked
upon
this
deserted
beach
as
a
private
promenade
an
appanage
of
the
house
they
walked
two
and
two
matthew
and
miss
regan
herbert
and
wyndwood
there
was
only
a
rim
of
orange
all
along
the
horizon
the
rollers
thundered
on
the
stones
smashing
themselves
in
flying
spray
a
fierce
undertow
kept
the
waves
sandy
for
half
a
mile
out
there
was
just
light
enough
to
distinguish
where
the
paler
green
commenced
the
darkness
grew
rapidly
as
they
walked
the
last
faint
reflection
of
sunset
faded
on
the
gray
sea
an
unusual
silence
possessed
them
after
the
exuberance
of
the
evening
they
stopped
now
and
again
to
shake
the
little
pebbles
out
of
their

all
was
black
when
they
reached
the
village
the
beach
was
full
of
wickerwork
and
the
headless
divided
forms
of
skate
and
loomed
uncannily
from
the
poles
on
which
they
hung
they
were
the
bait
only
a
stray
mongrel
represented
the
village
which
already
slept
the
sea
was
mournful
and
gloomy
its
pitchy
blackness
over
which
the
sky
hinged
like
a
gray
lid
was
relieved
only
by
its
own
broken
lines
of
foam
which
sometimes
rolled
in
six
deep
looking
exactly
like
streaks
of
phosphorescence
on
a
dark
wall
and
adding
weirdness
to
the
forlorn
desolation
of
the
scene
there
was
no
other
line
of
light
either
on
sea
or
land
the
lonesome
sea
tossed
sleeplessly
in
its
agony
howling
and
crying
they
turned
back
interchanging
companions
during
the
walk
wyndwood
suddenly
asked
matthew
if
his
wife
knew
where
he
was
he
said
sometimes
his
brother
billy
did
billy
lived
with
her
his
man
forwarded
all
letters
from
his
studio
after
a
long
pause
he
added
that
practically
he
had
been
separated
from
his
wife
for
years
eleanor
murmured
again
woman
and
he
was
too
to
look
her
in
the
face
and
to
read
that
the
sympathy
was
for
him
they
relapsed
into
silence
and
indeed
conversation
was
difficult
the
night
had
grown
wilder
the
wind
blew
more
fiercely
drenching
their
faces
with
salt
spray
whirling
them
round
and
round
and
almost
lifting
them
off
their
feet
but
the
clouds
were
driven
off
and
the
heaven
was
revealed
majestic
near
the
house
wyndwood
and
matthew
strang
stopped
to
admire
the
sublime
spectacle
sheltering
themselves
from
the
gale
in
a
niche
in
the
cliff
the
other
two
had
already
gone
round
the
craggy
projection
which
hid
the
house
they
watched
the
mad
cavalry
charge
of
creaming
billows
watched
them
break
thundering
and
throwing
their
spray
heavenwards
like
a
continuous
play
of
white
fountains
all
along
the
line
of
march
to
the
right
beyond
the
village
whence
they
had
come
where
the
cliff
jutted
out
at
its
lowest
level
a
ghostly
fountain
leaped
again
and
again
sheer
over
the
top
of
the
cliff
with
a
crashing
and
splashing
that
was
succeeded
by
the
moan
of
the
wave
soughing
through
the
rattling
pebbles
her
face
flushed
with
the
passion
of
the
storm
showed
divinely
in
the
dim
starlight
beneath
her
wrap
her
bosom
panting
from
the
walk
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
heaved
with
excitement
the
gale
had
dishevelled
her
hair
they
scarcely
spoke
the
of
the
sea
crashed
majestically
like
the
bass
in
some
savage
symphony
of
the
winds
now
at
last
the
moon
leaped
out
framed
in
a
weird
the
moonlight
played
on
her
loveliness
and
made
it
wonderful
she
moved
slightly
forward
cliff
is
too
damp
to
lean
upon
she
murmured
audaciously
he
slipped
a
trembling
arm
against
the
rock
and
let
her
form
rest
against
that
she
scarcely
seemed
conscious
of
him
she
was
watching
the
rampant
seething
waters
volleying
their
white
jets
skyward
with
a
crash
of
cannon
that
outroared
the
wind
her
scarlet
lips
were
parted
eagerly
the
dreamy
light
had
gone
from
her
eyes
they
flashed
fire
i
could
dare
she
cried
the
wind
blew
her
tresses
into
his
face
the
perfume
of
them
stung
his
blood
her
loveliness
was
maddening
him
so
close
so
close
oh
to
shower
mad
kisses
upon
her
lips
her
eyes
her
hair
what
did
it
matter
there
on
that
wild
beach
alone
with
the
elements
he
had
been
so
near
death
who
would
have
recked
if
he
had
been
dead
now
tossed
in
that
welter
of
waters
the
waves
broke
with
a
thousand
thunders
the
white
fountains
flew
at
the
stars
they
seemed
alive
exultant
frenzied
with
the
ecstasy
of
glorious
living
oh
for
life
simple
sublime
the
keen
tingling
savage
life
of
vikings
and
in
the
days
before
civilization
in
the
days
when
men
loved
and
hated
fiercely
strenuously
wrenching
through
rapine
and
slaughter
the
women
they
coveted
ah
surely
he
had
some
of
their
blood
it
ran
in
his
veins
like
fire
he
was
of
their
race
despite
his
dreamings
he
was
his
son
loving
the
storm
and
the
battle
the
wind
wailed
it
was
like
the
cry
of
his
tortured
heart
his
yearning
for
happiness
it
rose
higher
and
higher
a
bat
flew
between
them
and
the
moon
eleanor
nestled
to
him
involuntarily
her
face
was
very
near
to
his
it
gleamed
seductively
there
was
no
abashment
only
alluring
loveliness
the
fire
in
her
eyes
kindled
him
now
not
to
the
secondary
life
of
art
but
to
the
primary
life
of
realities
could
she
not
hear
his
heart
beat
yes
surely
the
storm
of
the
elements
had
passed
into
her
blood
too
her
face
was
ardent
ecstatic
his
arm
held
her
tight
oh
to
stake
the
world
on
a
kiss
the
moon
was
hidden
again
they
were
alone
in
the
mad
dim
night
the
complexities
of
society
were
far
away
they
looked
at
each
other
and
through
her
eyes
he
seemed
to
see
heaven
a
star
fell
overhead
it
drew
her
eyes
away
a
moment
to
watch
its
fiery
curve
he
felt
the
spell
was
broken
the
wind
shrieked
with
an
eldritch
cry
like
the
mocking
threnody
of
his
thwarted
hope
he
had
a
shuddering
remembrance
of
mad
peggy
and
straightway
he
saw
her
weird
figure
dashing
round
the
crag
in
the
darkness
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
a
lovely
face
at
once
radiant
and
frenzied
gleaming
from
between
its
dusky
folds
his
heart
almost
stopped
a
superstitious
thrill
froze
his
hot
blood
never
to
be
happy
ah
god
never
never
to
thirst
and
thirst
and
nothing
ever
to
quench
his
thirst

the

passionate
arms
round

darling
i
am
for
the
happier
herbert
had
spoken
and
olive
had
listened
shyly
humbly
with
tears
full
of
an
exquisite
uplifting
emotion
akin
to
the
exaltation
of
righteousness
at
the
thought
of
giving
herself
to
this
man
of
living
her
life
with
and
for
the
one
true
soul
in
the
world
they
stood
close
to
the
hoary
rim
of
the
black
welter
dusky
figures
and
a
little
apart
from
each
other
the
shining
house
in
the
background
when
did
you
begin
to
think
of
me
in
that
way
she
faltered
never
thought
of
you
in
any
other
but
that
night
when
matthew
arrived
when
you
sat
in
the
chair
you
maddened
me
you
were
adorable
the
contrast
was
exquisite
to
think
of
you
a
wilful
little
misanthrope
to
think
of
that
glorious
wayward
creature
fading
away
till
she
suited
the
chair
oh
it
was
too
he
broke
off
passion
robbed
him
of
words
he
moved
nearer
she
drew
back
but
will
you
she
hesitated
shy
of
the
word
me
when
i
do
suit
the
chair
shall
always
see
you
as
you
were
she
laughed
with
a
just
then
she
confessed
deliciously
fluttering
even
now
like
a
bird
in
the
net
was
beginning
to
get
frightened
of
you
i
felt
you
growing
upon
me
shadowing
the
horizon
like
the
roc
in
the
and
the
pain
of
the
world
was
outside
in
the
great
black
night
calling
to
me
in
my
slough
of
witch
veil
those
eyes
or
i
shall
kiss
she
retreated
why
were
you
frightened
of
me
he
asked
tenderly
she
said
humbly
in
little
shy
jerks
felt
like
in
the
sea
this
morning
one
little
atom
and
the
whole
world
against
me
and
my
own
weakness
most
of
all
i
had
prided
myself
on
my
swimming
and
here
was
i
being
dragged
under
just
like
other
girls
a
victim
to
the
same
ridiculous
delightful
candid
creature
with
me
as
the
object
be
flippant
now
how
delicious
his
name
sounded
it
made
amends
for
the
rebuke
do
understand
me
marriage
is
a
second
birth
voluntary
this
time
it
means
accepting
the
universe
which
was
thrust
upon
one
means
making
the
best
of
surely
it
means
more
it
means
passing
it
on
to
others
but
i
surrender
i
can
not
live
without

sprang
to
take
her
but
she
eluded
him
the
moon
is
covered
up
only

to
see
your
talk
like
other
men
though
i
have
fallen
like
other
you
are
always
yourself
olive
i
have
dreamed
of
this
moment
i
would
not
have
it
otherwise
except
perhaps
with
you
in
the
chair
and
a
poke
you
are

is
such
a
conventional
ending
to
a
holiday
we
must
preserve
what
originality

recovering
her

a

incongruous

in
his
voice

he
murmured

she
repeated
and
her
eyes
were
suffused
with
tender
moisture
there
was
a
delicious
silence
he
tried
to
take
her
hand
this
time
she
abandoned
it
to
him
a
wave
of
moral
emotion
lifted
her
to
the
stars
the

the
black

crashed

at

but

her

she
went
on
thoughtfully
proceeding
to
misquote

or
your
station
do
your

have

to

not
to

the

be
encouraged
to

the

should
be
taught
contentment
else
their
strength
for
good
is
wasted
and
the
electric
current
of
love
generated
by
those
palms
flashed
to
her
soul
the
mission
of
a
life
of
noble
work
hand

herbert
scarcely
heard
her
the
glow
of
her
lovely
face
the
flashes
of
feeling
that
passed
over
it
the
tears
that
glistened
on
her
eyelashes
these
absorbed
his
senses
her
generalizations
were
only
a
vague
exquisite
music
he
lifted
her
hand
and
held
it
passionately
to
his
lips
she
murmured
beseechingly
will
never
disappoint
me
herbert
darling
and
he
strove
to
draw
her
nearer
and
press
his
first
kiss
upon
those
bewitching
lips
a
star
falling
she
cried
and
slipped
from
his
hold
a
beautiful
diana
virgin
as
the
white
spray
and
tameless
as
the
night
she
had
disappointed
herbert
he
was
puzzled
but
as
she
disappeared
round
the
cliff
in
quest
of
the
others
a
smile
of
triumphant
content
curled
round
his
boyish
lips
the
last
touch
of
piquancy
he
murmured

he
chased
her
round

crag
chapter
viii
eleanor
wyndwood
two
days
after
engagement
matthew
strang
left
devonshire
on
the
plea
of
a
death
in
the
family
a
letter
from
billy
had
indeed
brought
the
news
that
father
was
no
more
matthew
had
never
thought
untenderly
of
old
coble
the
mountain
of
a
man
had
acted
generously
after
his
lights
and
now
that
his
genial
roar
had
passed
into
the
eternal
silence
the
pathos
of
death
softened
his
towards
his
memory
and
towards
the
bereaved
daughter
nevertheless
plea
was
only
a
pretext
he
had
no
intention
of
intruding
upon
rosina
after
her
recent
reception
of
him
he
had
no
reason
to
suppose
a
visit
would
be
welcome
the
letter
from
billy
had
included
no
message
from
her
except
a
request
superfluously
and
irritatingly
formal
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
give
to
her
aunt
clara
who
had
gone
to
live
with
old
coble
when
his
daughter
married
his
reply
to
billy
contained
warmly
sympathetic
reference
to
the
loss
of
old
coble
and
expressed
his
joy
at
the
prospect
of
receiving
miss
coble
his
real
reason
for
fleeing
from
devonshire
was
his
discovery
of
his
real
feeling
towards
wyndwood
when
the
frenzy
of
the
stormy
night
had
merged
in
the
sober
reflections
of
the
mild
morning
he
shuddered
to
think
how
near
he
had
gone
to
forfeiting
her
respect
to
insulting
her
by
the
revelation
of
a
dishonorable
passion
to
continue
in
her
daily
society
would
have
been
too
great
a
torment
aggravated
as
it
must
have
been
by
the
sight
of
happiness
perhaps
the
rude
reminder
of
his
domestic
shackles
contained
in
letter
strengthened
his
resolve
to
tear
himself
away
courtesy
compelled
him
to
leave
behind
him
an
invitation
to
the
ladies
to
take
tea
one
day
at
his
studio
which
neither
had
ever
seen
how
could
he
snap
abruptly
the
links
he
had
forged
with
this
delightful
twain
he
threw
himself
with
ardor
into
work
trying
to
soothe
his
pain
by
expressing
it
in
art
as
a
woman
sheds
it
away
in
tears
he
toiled
at
a
symbolic
picture
to
illustrate
sonnet
shackled
with
hand
to
he
put
the
figures
in
a
vague
landscape
but
did
not
study
his
models
in
the
open
for
he
now
had
a
desire
to
produce
that
fatness
of
effect
suggested
by
a
concentrated
studio
light
instead
of
the
dry
flatness
which
the
open
air
always
diffused
he
no
longer
pinned
himself
to
technical
theories
finding
by
experience
that
he
only
invented
them
afterwards
to
justify
the
procedure
his
instinct
dictated
for
any
particular
picture
but
his
progress
with
was
slow
and
unsatisfactory
he
was
feeling
about
as
it
were
for
a
new
manner
worthy
of
her
who
inspired
it
he
wrote
her
once
telling
her
that
it
was
on
the
easel
and
reminding
her
and
miss
regan
of
their
promise
to
visit
him
on
their
return
from
devonshire
and
he
had
from
her
an
answer
elegantly
indited
on
dainty
crested
paper
delicately
scented
which
he
held
often
to
his
lips
with
a
rankling
gnawing
pain
of
unsatisfied
and
unspoken
desire
she
wrote
that
she
was
very
anxious
to
see
the
picture
and
also
to
be
back
in
town
for
she
was
weary
of
the
country
with
its
monotony
its
lack
of
the
complex
thrill
of
civilization
not
that
the
town
held
much
to
enthral
her
fortunately
olive
had
consented
to
the
paris
project
the
girl
did
not
want
to
marry
before
next
summer
and
rather
hailed
the
idea
of
a
farewell
bohemian
period
of
art
and
liberty
what
she
eleanor
would
do
when
she
lost
olive
heaven
only
knew
and
then
came
the
wail
of
which
his
ear
had
caught
already
in
the
first
stages
of
their
acquaintanceship
he
interpreted
it
in
the
light
of
his
own
blank
unrest
but
to
imagine
her
hungering
for
him
as
he
hungered
for
her
was
impossible
to
his
reverent
passion
that
she
admired
and
liked
him
he
could
not
doubt
and
in
one
or
two
instants
of
mutual
electricity
he
had
dared
to
think
that
herbert
was
right
and
that
she
loved
him
but
his
diffidence
could
never
cherish
the
hope
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
and
even
if
she
indeed
loved
him
he
felt
that
her
delicacy
her
finer
more
ethereal
ethical
sense
would
preserve
her
from
the
wistful
images
that
tortured
him
it
was
the
memory
of
her
unhappy
marriage
to
which
her
sadness
must
be
due
no
doubt
too
her
life
lacked
love
though
she
might
not
be
consciously
aware
of
it
when
she
at
last
came
to
see
the
picture
he
was
startled
to
find
her
alone
and
the
bearer
of
a
message
of
apology
from
miss
regan
his
studio
being
so
to
speak
a
place
of
business
he
was
not
unused
to
receive
ladies
in
connection
with
commissions
but
his
poor
agonized
heart
that
had
so
ached
to
see
her
again
pulsed
furiously
with
mad
hope
as
her
stately
figure
clad
in
black
that
set
off
her
beauty
in
novel
lights
moved
slowly
about
the
great
studio
admiring
pictures
which
he
would
have
hidden
from
her
in
the
days
when
he
thought
of
her
more
as
a
spiritual
critic
than
a
woman
now
even
though
she
stood
before
him
making
remarks
he
was
too
distraught
to
catch
the
purport
of
her
criticisms
he
followed
her
about
in
a
haze
a
dream
speaking
replying
and
feeling
all
the
while
as
if
it
was
all
part
of
a
game
of
and
in
a
moment
the
thin
pretence
would
be
thrown
off
and
she
would
be
in
his
arms
but
the
moments
passed
the
haze
cleared
and
he
realized
that
he
was
entertaining
a
fashionable
lady
wrapped
up
in
artistic
interest
with
no
apparent
relation
to
the
woman
who
had
flushed
with
the
passion
of
the
sea
and
the
winds
on
that
night
of
stress
and
storm
his
mind
flew
back
from
her
bodily
presence
to
picture
her
leaning
against
his
arm
and
the
memoried
vision
seemed
incredible
she
was
unapproachably
demure
in
her
gown
over
the
shoulders
she
wore
a
short
cape
embroidered
in
jet
with
a
beaded
fringe
finished
off
with
a
filmy
black
lace
reaching
just
below
the
waist
when
she
threw
it
back
matt
saw
the
great
puff
sleeves
of
her
gown
and
a
collar
that
combined
with
them
to
give
an
feeling
at
her
throat
was
a
soft
ruche
of
black
chiffon
and
from
this
monotone
of
black
the
blond
skin
of
the
throat
and
face
rose
dazzling
crowned
by
a
small
pink
bonnet
of
shamrock
shape
entirely
composed
of
roses
with
a
butterfly
fluttering
over
it
now
and
then
she
pointed
out
something
with
a
long
forefinger
her
left
hand
held
a
dainty
little
book
that
looked
like
herself
poetry
how
far
away
she
seemed
standing
thus
at
his
side
he
was
in
a
fever
of
chills
and
heats
she
stopped
longest
before
his
unfinished
picture
of
he
heard
her
approving
his
conception
of
shackled
with
hand
to
hand
but
even
as
her
ravishing
lips
spoke
golden
words
of
praise
his
vain
longing
to
kiss
them
admonished
him
how
feebly
his
symbols
expressed
the
he
was
feeling
the
longer
he
heard
the
music
of
her
lauding
voice
the
more
those
gray
eyes
kindled
below
the
pink
bonnet
in
adoration
of
his
genius
the
more
his
disgust
with
the
picture
grew
and
when
a
chance
word
of
hers
reminded
him
that
the
subject
had
already
been
treated
in
the
last
academy
he
determined
to
destroy
his
work
the
moment
she
was
gone
though
he
had
always
been
aware
of
the
little
skied
picture
which
had
drawn
miss
eccentric
attention
the
last
vestiges
of
his
hope
of
her
love
died
as
she
discussed
fatality
with
apparent
unconsciousness
that
to
him
at
least
the
picture
stood
for
something
personal
her
aloofness
was
exacerbating
the
heats
of
his
fever
died
only
the
chill
was
left
he
gave
her
some
tea
and
became
gradually
aware
that
she
was
abnormally
loquacious
and
vivacious
he
remembered
to
ask
after
miss
health
and
was
told
that
olive
was
bright
and
gay
with
only
rare
reactions
of
pessimism
wyndwood
wondered
dolefully
again
what
she
would
do
when
olive
was
married
his
heart
bolder
than
his
lips
beat
to
me
come
to
but
she
did
not
seem
to
catch
its
appeal
though
his
eyes
spoke
too
in
his
embarrassment
he
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
dainty
little
book
she
had
laid
down
on
the
table
he
started
at
finding
it
a
new
volume
of
harold
poems
and
when
on
the
he
read
his
face
twitched
noticeably
that
was
the
book
mr
lavender
wrote
about
in
the
letter
that
primitiva
lost
she
said
quickly
just
out
see
he
calls
you
eleanor
he
observed
tonelessly
she
responded
smiling
is
a
poetic
license
besides
it
is
a
screen
there
are
so
many
that
sounded
true
to
his
bitter
mood
there
were
indeed
so
many
eleanors
all
in
contradiction
he
kept
turning
over
the
leaves
in
silent
jealousy
that
is
a
very
pretty
one
you
have
there
she
said
lightly
might
suggest
a
subject
to
you
read
it
aloud
only
ten
fuming
inwardly
at
the
suggestion
that
the
dapper
poet
of
and
the
hero
of
the
nougat
whom
he
mentally
classed
with
roy
as
an
interloper
could
afford
him
any
inspiration
and
further
incensed
by
the
command
to
read
the
verses
he
gabbled
through
the
little
poem
which
extended
over
two
rough
creamy
pages
reading
an
old
romance
watch
her
dainty
mouth
that
trembles
with
the
exquisite
and
wondrous
tide
that
steals
from
it
of
song
redolent
of
the
south
while
her
april
countenance
the
music
of
the
quaint
romance
the
sweeter
for
a
sense
of
pain
sends
sun
and
shade
and
lost
in
dream
her
sweet
eyes
softly
flash
and
gleam
with
golden
smiles
and
diamond
hope
she
read
it
better
than
that
laughed
wyndwood
mirthfully
she
make
the
fourth
line
scan
anyhow
he
said
you
mean
another
poetic
rosalind
seems
to
be
another
he
said
surlily
no
not
rosalind
i
a
dainty
mouth
mine
is
a
rose
at
and
her
laugh
showed
the
white
teeth
gleaming
against
the
red
lips
her
arch
laughing
face
so
close
to
his
across
the
little
tantalized
him
intolerably
is
a
red
red
rose
he
whispered
hoarsely
half
rising
and
bending
over
as
if
to
survey
it
of
the
thorn
she
laughed
nervously
drawing
back
involuntarily
to
think
that
but
for
the
who
found
letter
she
rattled
on
hastily
other
fair
lady
would
have
had
the
honor
of
the
of
the
other
eleanors
perhaps
he
said
sulkily
sinking
back
into
his
chair
primitiva
she
cried
in
unabated
hilariousness
and
intensified
volubility
been
such
fun
you
know
olive
has
brought
her
to
london
she
begged
her
away
from
her
father
to
the
excessive
joy
of
primitiva
who
has
become
her
devoted
slave
the
other
night
olive
took
her
to
the
theatre
with
us
and
would
have
her
in
the
box
she
had
been
wrought
up
to
a
wild
excitement
and
when
she
got
inside
the
theatre
and
looked
round
at
the
festive
company
she
drew
a
deep
breath
of
rapture
she
said
she
liked
it
very
much
long
before
the
orchestra
struck
up
olive
discovered
that
primitiva
imagined
she
was
already
in
complete
enjoyment
of
the
play
and
that
to
sit
in
the
theatre
was
all
in
all
only
one
thing
marred
pleasure
she
was
looking
round
furtively
for
your
cousin
and
at
last
asked
where
herbert
sat
not
it
transpired
because
of
his
position
as
but
because
she
had
heard
us
talk
of
herbert
as
writing
a
play
and
imagined
he
was
an
inseparable
adjunct
of
the
theatre
of
course
she
know
even
now
that
there
are
more
theatres
than
one
when
the
overture
struck
up
she
was
surprised
and
delighted
by
this
unexpected
addition
to
the
pleasures
of
the
evening
the
rising
of
the
curtain
was
the
climax
of
her
astonishment
and
her
transport
the
action
of
the
piece
a
melodrama
purposely
chosen
for
her
behoof
by
our
sportive
friend
experimenting
upon
her
freshness
seized
her
from
the
start
and
kept
her
riveted
the
fall
of
the
first
curtain
and
the
arrest
of
the
innocent
man
for
the
murder
left
her
weeping
bitterly
real
you
little
goose
olive
said
to
pacify
her
it
primitiva
replied
opening
her
brimming
trustful
eyes
to
their
widest
she
gave
a
little
sobbing
laugh
i
thought
they
was
all
alive
then
she
rose
to
go
and
was
astonished
to
hear
that
there
was
more
alas
it
would
have
been
better
had
she
gone
when
the
wife
visiting
the
hero
in
prison
kissed
him
primitiva
inquired
if
the
actor
and
actress
were
really
married
and
learning
that
they
were
not
was
too
disgusted
to
sympathize
any
further
with
their
misfortunes
it
revolted
her
concluded
wyndwood
taking
up
her
teacup
with
an
air
of
preparing
for
the
resumption
of
sips
a
man
who
was
not
a
husband
should
kiss
and
her
face
gleamed
more
tantalizing
than
ever
under
the
roses
of
her
bonnet
his
fingers
dented
the
teaspoon
they
fidgeted
with
it
seemed
intolerable
that
his
life
should
be
spoiled
by
acceptance
of
the
moral
of
this
simple
creature
he
with
his
artistic
agonies
and
his
complex
sorrows
and
his
high
imaginings
to
be
squeezed
into
the
same
moral
moulds
as
primitiva
he
refused
to
see
the
humor
of
her
the
girl
had
no
more
interest
for
him
than
that
irritating
roy
it
was
maddening
to
have
eleanor
sitting
there
in
cold
blood
the
honorable
wyndwood
an
irreproachable
widow
in
black
talking
abstractly
of
kisses
then
the
tense
string
of
expectation
snapped
the
apathy
that
he
felt
in
the
presence
of
rosina
invaded
him
he
stirred
his
tea
listlessly
awaiting
the
moment
of
her
departure
as
she
talked
on
loquacious
to
the
end
prattling
of
and
beethoven
and
swinburne
his
apathy
quickened
into
impatience
he
longed
for
her
to
be
gone
his
hidden
fingers
played
a
tattoo
on
the
side
of
his
chair
she
bade
him
at
last
she
would
not
see
him
again
for
many
months
unless
he
came
to
paris
always
run
over
to
do
the
salon
he
answered
indifferently
when
he
had
seen
her
stately
and
stiff
to
her
carriage
and
his
had
shut
him
in
again
he
ripped
up
the
canvas
with
his
old
knife
in
a
paroxysm
of
fury
his
eye
caught
the
silver
regatta
cup
standing
proudly
upon
the
piano
he
felt
like
dashing
it
down
then
it
occurred
to
him
how
fine
and
bitter
a
revenge
it
would
be
upon
her
and
humanity
at
large
to
fill
it
with
poison
and
drain
it
to
the
dregs
but
he
only
threw
himself
upon
a
couch
in
a
passion
of
sobs
such
as
had
not
shaken
him
since
childhood
the
great
picturesque
room
which
the
autumn
twilight
had
draped
in
dusk
was
ineffably
dreary
without
her
his
heart
seemed
full
of
dust
and
tears
were
a
blessed
relief
in
the
drought
they
probably
saved
him
from
ending
his
empty
life
there
and
then
he
rallied
and
began
other
pictures
but
he
could
do
nothing
with
them
he
refused
commissions
for
portraits
hating
the
imposition
of
subject
and
fearful
of
exposing
his
restlessness
to
a
gaze
the
return
of
the
world
to
town
renewed
social
solicitations
but
he
felt
he
was
wearing
his
heart
on
his
sleeve
and
declined
to
parade
it
through
despite
this
gain
of
time
the
weeks
passed
without
any
definite
product
he
was
searching
but
he
could
not
find
one
day
he
would
sit
down
and
fix
in
charcoal
some
rough
suggestions
for
a
greater
symbolic
picture
than
that
which
he
had
destroyed
but
the
next
day
he
would
be
working
up
his
recollections
of
devonshire
trying
by
a
series
of
tentative
touches
on
a
toned
canvas
to
evolve
the
romantic
mystery
of
those
illumined
villages
niched
in
the
cliffs
or
of
the
moon
making
a
lovely
rippling
path
across
the
dark
lonely
sea
as
eleanor
had
made
across
his
life
while
a
day
or
so
after
he
would
discard
these
thinly
painted
shadowy
and
painting
straight
from
the
shoulder
his
canvas
with
brutal
blobs
of
paint
that
at
a
distance
merged
into
the
living
flow
of
red
sunlit
water
and
always
this
rankling
gnawing
pain
of
unsatisfied
and
unspoken
desire
no
man
could
work
with
that
at
his
breast
and
her
rare
letters
did
not
allay
it
though
they
spoke
no
word
of
love
but
were
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
free
student
life
in
paris
the
glorious
the
fun
of
dining
occasionally
for
a
few
centimes
in
tiny
and
going
to
the
theatre
off
the
boulevard
montparnasse
where
they
gave
a
bonus
of
à
de
between
the
pieces
oh
if
she
had
only
been
younger
less
staled
by
life
if
she
could
only
begin
over
again
if
she
only
had
the
energy
of
olive
who
started
work
at
the
academy
at
the
preternatural
hour
of
eight
but
she
had
lost
the
faculty
of
beginnings
she
feared
and
she
made
but
poor
progress
in
sculpture
that
was
the
undercurrent
of
these
gay
letters
the
characteristic
note
of
despondency
rosina
held
out
no
hand
of
reconciliation
his
only
contact
with
her
was
through
billy
who
paid
him
one
visit
to
escort
over
the
studio
his
wife
had
it
transpired
held
forth
so
copiously
and
continuously
upon
its
glories
that
the
poor
creature
had
plucked
up
courage
to
ask
to
see
it
and
rosina
who
had
evidently
concealed
the
breach
with
her
famous
husband
had
besought
billy
to
convoy
her
and
so
one
day
these
two
routed
out
the
sick
lion
from
the
recesses
of
his
den
the
appearance
of
miss
clara
coble
was
as
much
a
shock
as
a
surprise
to
matthew
strang
in
the
nine
years
or
so
since
she
had
assisted
at
his
wedding
an
unimportant
but
not
disagreeable
personage
tall
and
as
her
brother
she
had
decayed
lamentably
she
was
now
an
ungainly
old
maid
stooping
and
with
feet
and
sharpened
features
she
had
a
nervous
twitch
of
the
eyelids
her
head
drooped
oddly
and
her
conversation
was
at
times
inconsecutive
to
the
verge
of
fatuity
from
the
day
of
her
birth
to
the
day
of
his
death
coble
had
thought
of
her
as
his
little
sister
and
he
never
realized
the
tragedy
of
her
spinsterhood
of
her
starved
nature
though
under
his
very
eye
she
had
peaked
and
pined
in
body
and
soul
but
it
leaped
to
the
eye
at
the
first
sight
of
her
and
her
image
remained
in
his
brain
infinitely
pathetic
the
ugliness
that
in
earlier
days
would
have
averted
his
eyes
in
artistic
disgust
drew
him
now
in
human
pity
he
grew
tenderer
to
rosina
at
the
thought
that
she
was
harboring
this
wreck
of
femininity
it
rejoiced
him
to
think
how
much
was
enjoying
this
visit
to
his
grandeurs
he
listened
with
pleased
tolerance
to
her
artless
babble
in
her
best
days
she
had
always
had
something
of
her
big
simplicity
as
she
told
tale
after
tale
out
of
school
repeating
the
colossal
things
her
poor
brother
had
said
about
his
genius
and
wealth
recounting
how
coble
had
thus
become
the
indirect
hero
of
the
temperance
bar
and
unconsciously
revealing
what
was
more
surprising
to
the
painter
the
pride
with
which
rosina
had
always
written
home
and
still
spoke
to
her
aunt
about
her
husband
and
his
fashionable
friends
and
successes
and
poor
miss
coble
expanded
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
great
man
which
she
had
never
hoped
to
breathe
her
cadaverous
cheek
took
a
flush
she
held
her
head
straighter
on
her
shoulders
he
felt
that
after
all
it
was
worth
while
being
famous
if
he
could
give
such
pleasure
to
simple
souls
by
his
mere
proximity
the
fame
he
had
sold
his
body
and
soul
for
was
a
joyless
possession
happy
for
him
if
it
could
yet
give
joy
to
others
billy
told
him
that
ruth
hailey
was
in
paris
at
the
hotel
windsor
with
verder
preparatory
to
the
long
antipodean
tour
and
suggested
that
he
might
call
upon
her
when
he
went
over
to
see
the
salon
if
she
was
still
there
matthew
wrote
down
the
address
but
said
he
think
he
should
go
over
that
year
billy
looked
disappointed
he
had
been
about
to
suggest
accompanying
his
brother
life
at
camden
town
he
intimated
fretfully
had
resumed
its
routine
and
he
glanced
towards
miss
coble
as
if
to
imply
that
her
advent
had
not
brightened
the
domestic
table
when
the
visitors
left
matthew
put
them
into
a
cab
and
drove
with
them
a
little
way
to
purchase
presents
for
the
children
there
was
a
doll
for
clara
and
a
box
of
animals
for
davie
to
rosina
he
did
not
venture
to
send
even
a
message
at
a
word
from
her
he
would
have
gone
to
her
but
he
had
no
stomach
to
cope
with
her
tantrums
this
new
reminder
of
home
left
him
more
depressed
than
before
it
was
impossible
to
concentrate
himself
upon
his
work
even
in
the
presence
of
models
they
were
an
unprofitable
expense
and
he
dismissed
them
and
brooded
over
the
ruins
of
his
life
without
eleanor
art
was
impossible
he
felt
true
art
he
could
not
produce
without
her
inspiration
and
false
art
was
falseness
to
her
and
a
vile
slavery
insomnia
dogged
his
nights
and
when
he
slept
it
was
but
to
suffer
under
harassing
dreams
fantastically
compounded
of
his
early
struggles
these
dreams
never
touched
his
later
life
many
of
them
dealt
oppressively
with
the
and
he
had
often
to
clean
endless
shades
with
chamois
leather
smashing
one
after
the
other
under
the
rebuking
but
agonizingly
unintelligible
pop
pop
of
hey
though
he
felt
sure
tommy
the
young
micmac
had
cracked
them
beforehand
and
what
added
to
the
agony
was
that
these
breakages
would
have
to
be
made
good
to
the
deacon
from
his
scanty
wage
or
worse
he
would
be
discharged
and
unable
to
send
the
monthly
subsidy
to
cobequid
village
the
anguish
and
anxiety
were
quite
as
harassing
as
though
the
troubles
were
real
he
made
one
desperate
excursion
into
society
it
was
the
delightful
of
a
gifted
whose
cultured
and
beautiful
wife
had
always
seemed
to
him
the
ideal
hostess
and
a
pretty
and
guileless
girl
full
of
enthusiasm
for
art
and
nature
and
the
life
that
was
opening
out
before
her
fell
to
his
escorting
arm
she
was
visibly
overpowered
by
her
luck
and
charmingly
deferential
at
first
his
responsive
smile
was
bitter
but
his
mood
lightened
under
her
engaging
freshness
and
the
champagne
he
imbibed
recklessly
but
the
next
reaction
aggravated
by
the
headache
of
indigestion
plunged
him
into
more
tenebrous
glooms
but
for
the
unkindly
fates
he
might
have
sat
with
such
a
wife
host
and
hostess
of
such
a
gathering
he
pictured
eleanor
receiving
his
guests
and
in
his
factitious
happiness
he
gathered
the
poor
and
the
despised
to
his
hearth
the
images
of
suicide
resurged
he
saw
it
on
the
bills
of
a
popular
why
not
the
position
was
hopeless
were
it
not
best
to
throw
it
up
how
the
world
would
stare
no
one
would
understand
the
reason
rosina
would
still
remain
unknown
irrelevant
to
the
situation
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
in
the
bitter
luxury
of
woe
but
he
did
not
commit
suicide
and
all
that
the
world
or
that
minute
portion
of
it
which
talks
art
wondered
at
was
why
matthew
strang
was
unrepresented
when
the
academy
opened
in
may
it
leaked
out
that
he
had
been
ill
and
there
were
sympathetic
paragraphs
which
were
not
altogether
misinformed
for
these
sleepless
or
nights
had
brought
on
nervous
prostration
and
acute
headaches
that
ancient
too
had
left
its
traces
in
his
system
and
when
he
was
worried
and
overwrought
his
body
had
to
pay
again
the
penalty
of
unforgiven
physical
error
again
as
in
those
days
he
thought
of
a
to
his
native
village
it
dwindled
down
to
crossing
the
channel
as
the
opening
of
the
salon
drew
nearer
and
nearer
he
felt
more
and
more
strongly
that
he
must
not
miss
the
exhibition
it
was
part
of
a
education
there
was
no
need
to
see
eleanor
wyndwood
by
remaining
on
the
fashionable
side
of
the
river
the
chances
were
he
would
not
even
come
across
her
casually
in
the
few
days
of
his
stay
no
there
was
nothing
to
apprehend
and
besides
it
began
to
be
increasingly
borne
in
upon
him
that
it
was
his
duty
to
look
up
ruth
hailey
she
had
called
upon
him
at
camden
town
and
etiquette
demanded
that
he
should
return
the
call
what
had
she
and
rosina
talked
about
he
wondered
dully
if
he
did
not
go
soon
she
might
be
off
to
australia
and
the
opportunity
of
seeing
his
ancient
playmate
would
probably
recur
nevermore
and
so
a
bright
may
morning
saw
him
arrive
in
the
capital
of
art
breakfast
hastily
at
the
grand
hotel
and
drive
straight
to
the
latin
quarter
other
climes
other
thoughts
and
the
gayety
of
the
boulevards
with
their
green
trees
and
kiosks
had
begun
to
steal
into
his
spirit
and
his
gloomy
apprehension
of
danger
to
dissipate
in
the
crisp
sunny
air
why
should
he
not
see
eleanor
wyndwood
and
then
he
discovered
that
he
did
not
know
her
address
that
she
wrote
from
the
english
art
club
he
hunted
out
the
place
but
the
concierge
told
him
she
was
not
there
and
gave
him
the
address
of
the
academy
most
of
the
ladies
attended
but
this
was
the
hour
of
and
monsieur
would
probably
not
find
them
there
till
the
afternoon
he
grew
downcast
again
and
dismissing
the
cab
he
sauntered
on
foot
towards
the
academy
trying
to
kill
time
he
dropped
into
a
tiny
restaurant
close
by
to
get
a
cup
of
coffee
it
was
decorated
by
studies
from
the
nude
evidently
accepted
in
payment
for
dinners
and
the
ceiling
had
a
central
decoration
that
reminded
him
of
his
own
crude
workmanship
in
the
of
that
hotel
in
new
brunswick
he
sat
down
at
a
little
table
facing
the
only
lady
customer
a
dashing
frenchwoman
the
warm
coloring
of
whose
handsome
face
showed
between
a
great
hat
and
a
bow
and
who
paused
between
her
spoonfuls
of
to
chant
joyously
coucou

in
sympathy
with
the
gay
refrain
hens
fluttered
and
clucked
about
the
two
sunlit
tables
and
a
goat
wandered
around
willing
to
eat
matthew
strang
fed
the
hens
and
was
taken
by
the
humors
of
the
quarter
into
which
he
had
scarcely
penetrated
before
knowing
mainly
the
other
side
of
the
water
perceiving
him
looking
at
her
pictures
the
stout
smiling
proprietress
whose
homely
face
minus
her
characteristic
smile
flared
in
paint
on
a
wall
protruding
from
a
bodice
asked
him
in
very
loud
tones
if
he
would
like
to
see
her
collection
and
straightway
haled
him
to
her
salon
which
was
hung
thickly
with
meritorious
pictures
upon
whose
beauties
she
held
a
running
comment
astonishing
matthew
by
the
intelligence
of
her
criticisms
represents
a
hawthorn
monsieur
which
blossoms
in
the
spring
this
was
done
by
a
dane
who
is
dead
the
king
of
denmark
offered
him
a
commission
but
he
would
not
work
for
him
because
he
was
a
revolutionary
in
painting
only
you
understand
an
impressionist
that
is
a
copy
of
the
one
in
the
luxembourg
i
paid
two
hundred
francs
to
have
it
made
because
i
love
the
original
so
oh
yes
it
is
a
very
good
copy
my
landlord
offered
me
four
hundred
for
it
but
i
prefer
to
live
in
a
little
apartment
surrounded
by
my
pictures
as
you
say
i
am
an
amateur
of
pictures
there
are
more
here
in
my
bedroom
and
she
ushered
him
in
apologizing
for
the
bed
not
being
made
then
she
told
him
her
history
she
was
a
widow
with
an
only
son
who
was
ah
she
was
beautiful
herself
when
she
had
twenty
years
her
son
was
to
be
an
artist
matthew
strang
feelingly
hoped
the
boy
would
become
a
great
artist
inwardly
he
wondered
wistfully
why
he
himself
had
not
been
blessed
with
an
mother
and
then
in
a
curious
flash
of
retrospective
insight
he
recognized
for
the
first
time
the
essential
artistic
elements
in
his
character
stifled
by
a
narrow
creed
her
craving
for
the
life
of
gay
cities
her
pagan
anger
at
abner
what
a
pity
she
had
not
been
born
in
this
freer
artistic
atmosphere
which
indeed
her
ancestors
must
have
breathed
though
their
blood
had
been
crossed
with
german
and
scotch
as
if
to
produce
his
own
contradictory
temperament
in
london
he
thought
artistic
connoisseurship
was
the
last
thing
one
would
look
for
in
small
shopkeepers
in
a
softer
mood
he
repaired
to
the
academy
which
was
entered
through
a
pair
of
large
folding
doors
that
gave
upon
a
stone
corridor
he
passed
through
this
passage
and
came
out
under
a
sloping
porch
with
broken
at
one
side
and
an
untidy
tree
at
the
top
of
a
flight
of
stone
steps
that
descended
thence
he
was
stopped
by
a
block
of
young
american
fellows
in
soft
felt
hats
who
motioned
him
to
stand
still
and
to
his
astonishment
and
somewhat
melancholy
amusement
he
found
himself
part
of
a
group
about
to
be
photographed
by
a
pretty
young
lady
student
in
the
sunny
dusty
below
the
group
she
had
posed
stretched
all
down
the
steps
and
consisted
mainly
of
models
male
and
female
there
were
italian
women
dusky
and
smiling
some
bareheaded
some
hooded
and
a
few
pressing
infants
literal
to
their
bosoms
there
was
an
italian
girl
of
fourteen
with
a
mustache
who
was
a
flare
of
color
in
her
green
velvet
apron
and
gorgeous
trailing
there
were
frenchwomen
with
coquettish
straw
hats
and
a
child
in
a
tam
shanter
there
was
a
corsican
in
a
with
hair
and
a
velvet
jacket
to
match
and
a
little
spanish
boy
in
a
white
hat
thrown
in
as
by
way
of
artistic
contrast
with
all
this
efflorescence
of
youth
was
a
doddering
pathetic
old
man
with
a
spreading
gray
beard
and
flowing
gray
locks
and
there
were
young
lady
students
of
divers
nationalities
polish
greek
dutch
and
american
curiously
interspersed
in
the
motley
group
which
stretched
right
down
the
stone
steps
between
the
stone
balustrades
that
terminated
in
stone
urns
spouting
disorderly
twigs
behind
the
pretty
photographer
were
the
walls
of
the
sculpture
atelier
which
high
beyond
her
head
were
replaced
by
long
windows
into
which
a
pink
tiptoeing
tried
to
peep
around
her
were
stools
damaged
busts
a
headless
angel
with
gaping
trunk
and
iron
stump
nursing
a
cherub
and
dismantled
swarming
with
sportive
black
kittens
and
facing
her
a
great
blackened
stone
head
of
medusa
stared
from
a
pedestal
awful
with
webs
across
the
mouth
and
athwart
the
hollow
orbits
and
in
the
snaky
hair
covered
with
green
moss
and
towering
over
her
head
and
dominating
the
stood
a
colossal
classical
statue
tarnished
and
mutilated
representing
a
huge
helmeted
hero
and
bleared
sustaining
a
heroine
as
armless
but
not
so
beautiful
as
the
venus
de
milo
doing
a
backward
fall
but
the
sun
shone
on
the
dusty
litter
and
the
mess
and
the
lumber
and
the
blossomed
beautifully
and
over
all
was
the
joy
of
youth
and
art
and
the
gayety
of
the
spring
matthew
strang
felt
an
ancient
thrill
pass
through
his
sluggish
veins
to
be
young
and
to
paint
what
happiness
his
eyes
moistened
in
sympathy
with
the
scene
the
models
were
redolent
of
art
the
very
children
breathed
art
the
babes
sucked
it
in
art
was
a
republic
and
everybody
was
equal
in
it
the
doughtiest
professor
and
the
meanest
model
the
richest
amateur
and
the
penurious
youth
starving
himself
to
be
there
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
art
it
was
the
essence
of
existence
there
were
people
who
lived
for
other
things
but
they
did
not
count
oh
the
free
brave
life
he
was
glad
to
be
photographed
as
part
and
parcel
of
all
this
fresh
aspiration
it
revivified
him
he
had
a
superstitious
sense
that
it
was
symbolic
the
group
scattered
dismissed
by
the
of
the
pretty
photographer
and
matthew
descending
the
steps
asked
her
if
wyndwood
worked
in
her
atelier
she
did
not
know
but
she
guessed
from
his
description
it
must
be
the
lady
who
had
dropped
in
once
or
twice
in
miss
company
miss
regan
came
regularly
every
morning
at
eight
but
not
at
all
in
the
afternoon
when
she
worked
at
home
miss
own
studio
was
in
an
impasse
about
ten
minutes
away
probably
her
friend
lived
with
her
heartily
thanking
his
informant
he
betook
himself
thither
he
found
the
impasse
in
a
prosaic
grimy
street
amid
which
the
charming
if
battered
of
venus
with
cupids
over
its
entrance
struck
an
unexpected
note
of
poetry
which
was
intensified
by
the
little
ionic
portico
with
classic
bronze
figures
between
its
pillars
that
faced
him
as
he
passed
through
the
corridor
leafy
trees
and
trellised
plants
added
rusticity
to
the
poetry
of
the
sunny
silent
deserted
so
curiously
sequestered
amid
the
surrounding
squalor
the
windows
of
many
studios
gave
upon
it
and
the
backs
of
canvases
showed
from
the
glass
annexes
for
study
but
as
he
passed
under
the
pretty
natural
porch
of
embowering
foliage
that
led
to
the
door
of
the
studio
he
sought
his
heart
beat
as
nervously
at
the
thought
of
again
facing
the
hon
wyndwood
as
when
in
his
young
days
he
had
first
saluted
the
magnificent
uncle
whose
name
he
bore
he
had
an
inward
shrinking
was
it
wise
to
expose
himself
to
the
perturbation
of
another
interview
with
this
cold
stately
creature
the
image
of
whom
passing
graciously
to
her
carriage
was
still
vivid
to
him
but
he
could
not
go
back
now
he
knocked
at
the
door
eleanor
opened
the
door
a
radiant
adorable
apparition
in
a
big
white
blouse
with
a
huge
serviceable
pocket
he
had
never
imagined
her
thus
he
was
as
taken
aback
by
her
appearance
as
she
by
his
presence
he
stared
at
her
in
silence
as
she
stood
there
under
the
overarching
greenery
with
gold
flecks
of
sunlight
on
her
hair
but
both
recovered
themselves
in
a
moment
the
sight
of
her
in
this
homely
artistic
costume
knocked
her
off
the
pedestal
of
fashion
and
propriety
on
which
his
mental
vision
had
posed
her
she
became
part
of
that
brave
young
democracy
of
art
he
had
just
left
and
there
was
a
charming
in
the
gay
laugh
with
which
withdrawing
her
long
white
hands
beyond
reach
of
his
proffered
glove
and
exhibiting
them
piquantly
she
cried
the
seriousness
of
the
imagined
meeting
vanished
in
a
twinkling
he
looked
at
her
dancing
eyes
the
sweet
red
mouth
smiling
with
a
gleam
of
lustrous
teeth
he
had
an
audacious
inspiration
then
nothing
for
it
but
he
said
smiling
back
and
finished
the
sentence
by
kissing
her
instantly
her
eyelids
drooped
her
lips
responded
passionately
to
his
they
were
withdrawn
in
a
moment
before
he
could
realize
what
he
had
done
or
the
wonderful
transformation
in
their
relations
the
open
air
she
cried
horrified
and
ran
within
he
followed
her
closing
the
door
his
heart
beat
tumultuously
now
nothing
could
undo
that
moment
a
wilderness
of
talk
could
not
have
advanced
matters
so
far
through
the
tall
glass
roof
of
the
airy
studio
the
sun
streamed
in
rays
of
dusty
gold
dappling
the
imaginative
clay
models
in
their
wet
wrappings
the
busts
fountains
serpents
witches
that
variegated
the
shelves
and
lent
an
air
of
fantasy
and
poetry
extruding
the
tedious
commonplace
of
plebeian
existence
and
harmonizing
with
the
joyous
aloofness
of
the
scene
in
the
its
sense
of
existence
in
and
for
itself
by
souls
attuned
to
art
and
dedicate
to
loveliness
wyndwood
stood
saucily
beautiful
leaning
against
a
shelf
with
one
hand
in
the
pocket
of
her
blouse
and
rubbing
the
clay
of
the
other
against
the
sides
of
what
looked
like
a
tin
filled
with
how
harmonious
was
that
tilt
to
her
nose
he
had
never
noticed
before
how
delightfully
it
turned
up
she
smiled
roguishly
creature
suppose
olive
had
been
in
the
great
moment
was
taken
in
a
livelier
key
than
he
had
ever
dreamed
were
out
he
said
trying
to
respond
to
her
lightness
though
he
trembled
in
every
limb
he
made
a
movement
towards
her
she
shrank
back
against
the
shelf
she
cried
gayly
spoil
your
he
dabbled
them
magnificently
in
a
heap
of
plaster
of
paris
and
advanced
nearer
spoil
my
blouse
she
cried
moving
hastily
away
to
dip
her
hands
in
a
bowl
of
water
he
tore
off
the
gloves
and
threw
them
on
the
floor
that
a
challenge
she
laughed
drying
her
hands
but
the
laughter
died
in
a
gurgle
he
had
stopped
her
breath
she
did
not
struggle
but
lay
in
his
arms
silent
like
a
tired
lovely
child
at
rest
at
last
her
happy
face
pressed
to
his
my
dear
she
murmured
cooingly
all
those
months
you
never
kissed
me
once
did
not
dare
he
answered
with
a
pang
of
remorse
gave
me
no
hint
that
you
that
you
cared
for
a
beautiful
blush
blossomed
and
faded
on
her
face
you
should
have
understood
i
needed
the
and
her
face
nestled
closer
against
his
even
now
it
seemed
that
this
marvellous
happiness
should
be
his
that
this
fastidious
complex
creature
of
fashionable
london
whom
he
had
dared
to
love
should
be
pillowing
her
perfumed
head
on
the
shoulder
of
the
man
who
in
his
laborious
and
wretched
youth
had
wheeled
a
barrow
through
whitechapel
his
life
lay
behind
him
like
a
steep
arduous
hill
rising
to
this
celestial
cloudland
i
had
only
known
he
said
brokenly
how
i
loved
you
that
night
of
the
storm
how
i
adored
you
she
confessed
deliciously
were
so
brave
so
manly
that
day
you
saved
life
you
saved
her
for
me
and
for
herbert
oh
how
noble
we
none
of
us
thanked
you
it
was
all
laughter
and
badinage
but
you
were
my
hero
my
true
great
strong
simple
and
her
lips
sought
his
humbly
her
eyes
swimming
in
tears
me
kiss
you
now
for
your
brave
deed
ah
how
i
was
afraid
when
herbert
looking
through
his
glass
cried
out
that
something
had
happened
to
olive
that
you
had
swum
back
for
her
i
felt
my
life
growing
dark
suppose
i
had
lost
you
and
her
mobile
face
grew
tragic
at
the
thought
he
held
her
tighter
it
is
so
good
to
be
with
you
he
articulated
in
a
hoarse
whisper
that
was
half
a
sob
her
tragic
features
lightened
to
a
winsome
reproachful
smile
when
i
came
to
your
studio
matthew
you
gave
me
tea
i
had
only
known
if
i
had
only
dared
must
dare
with
a
her
arms
had
been
resting
on
his
shoulders
she
threw
them
around
his
neck
my
master
now
and
conscience
slipped
into
paradise
he
unwound
her
arms
forget
my
she
moved
her
chin
bewitchingly
upward
have
sealed
my
he
kissed
them
again
you
can
love
me
despite
that
i
am
not
worthy
of
such
a
her
bosom
heaved
beneath
the
blouse
her
eyes
kindled
with
the
old
spiritual
fire
her
voice
rang
passionately
worthy
life
has
been
too
cruel
to
you
you
need
a
heart
to
cherish
you
you
shall
not
be
starved
of
the
sunshine
you
shall
work
in
happiness
ah
that
is
what
i
have
learned
here
in
this
happy
liberal
air
art
is
the
child
of
joyful
labor
it
is
the
sunshine
of
life
you
are
sad
miserable
and
it
harrows
my
heart
oh
if
i
can
bring
joy
and
peace
to
the
soul
of
a
man
like
you
if
i
can
indeed
inspire
your
art
my
wretched
life
will
not
have
been
wasted
you
have
told
me
that
i
could
tell
it
me
and
you
only
can
bring
me
joy
and
she
caressed
his
hair
with
a
tender
protective
hand
matthew
she
murmured
you
eleanor
he
faltered
tremulously
shall
not
make
you
unhappy
shall
be
happier
than
i
have
ever
been
and
her
arms
stole
round
him
again
in
simple
trust
i
was
forgetting
life
owes
happiness
too
if
i
dared
to
think
i
could
bring
you
forgetfulness
of
the
past
she
shuddered
her
arms
unlaced
themselves
of
their
own
accord
she
dropped
into
a
chair
before
the
table
and
laid
them
across
the
and
buried
her
head
in
her
hands
he
stood
by
helpless
torn
by
emotions
waiting
till
the
flood
of
bitter
memories
should
have
spent
itself
watching
her
shoulders
quivering
and
the
sunlight
lying
on
her
hair
like
a
consecration
douglas
she
was
moaning
i
do
you
wrong
did
i
do
you
wrong
but
i
meant
the
best
i
always
meant
the
best
god
knows
and
you
can
not
chide
me
now
you
are
dead
and
cold
and
it
is
all
so
long
he
shivered
nervously
truly
women
were
incomprehensible
he
thought
no
man
could
follow
the
leaps
and
turns
of
their
emotions
they
were
a
higher
more
ethereal
order
of
being
but
he
reverenced
her
for
her
loyalty
to
the
unworthy
dead
her
punctilious
even
while
he
envied
the
man
who
had
been
privileged
to
call
her
he
touched
her
hair
reverently
there
where
the
sunshine
rested
cry
dear
a
great
burst
of
sobbing
shook
her
life
is
so
difficult
he
bent
down
beside
her
ineffably
pitiful
are
going
to
make
it
easier
for
one
another
he
said
gently
his
hair
touched
hers
she
turned
her
face
and
their
lips
met
are
going
to
begin
over
again
he
murmured
she
stifled
her
sobs
like
a
soothed
child
and
sprang
up
with
a
smile
struggling
through
with
you
i
can
begin
over
again
master
and
she
looked
into
his
face
with
her
naïve
beseeching
trustfulness
is
a
new
life
already
he
said
touching
her
blouse
she
gave
a
laugh
of
childish
joy
yes
this
is
a
new
life
the
past
is
dead
this
is
my
robe
ah
it
changes
one
this
paris
does
it
not
i
am
an
artist
and
you
are
my
master
it
is
you
who
have
awakened
me
to
art
oh
i
knew
this
would
happen
that
wonderful
old
woman
a
in
bethnal
green
the
duchess
of
portsdown
gave
me
her
address
and
after
you
were
so
cold
to
me
when
i
came
to
your
studio
in
london
i
went
to
see
her
such
a
queer
wrinkled
hag
and
such
a
dingy
wretched
room
up
such
a
dirty
flight
of
stairs
oh
i
was
afraid
but
she
was
marvellous
she
knew
i
was
a
widow
that
i
had
been
married
unhappily
that
i
was
a
fashionable
lady
though
i
went
in
my
oldest
clothes
and
hid
my
rings
in
my
purse
for
fear
of
their
being
stolen
oh
where
have
i
put
them
he
found
them
and
she
slipped
them
on
she
said
i
should
love
again
and
be
loved
you
should
have
seen
her
wicked
old
eyes
as
she
spoke
of
love
they
were
like
live
coals
and
then
she
predicted
that
i
should
marry
again
and
lead
a
long
and
happy
life
with
a
dark
man
distinguished
and
rich
who
should
inspire
me
to
a
new
faith
it
marvellous
she
took
his
hand
and
smoothed
the
wrist
caressingly
is
you
who
have
inspired
me
to
a
new
faith
he
answered
tremulously
is
you
who
have
awakened
me
to
art
do
you
know
what
happened
to
me
this
morning
when
i
went
to
seek
you
out
i
too
was
he
told
her
the
auspicious
incident
how
he
had
been
photographed
as
part
of
the
fresh
young
she
clapped
her
jewelled
hands
is
providential
foreordained
we
are
to
be
he
shivered
with
sudden
foreboding
prophetess
declared
i
was
never
to
be
happy
he
said
sadly
thirst
and
to
thirst
and
never
to
quench
my
thirst
that
is
all
superstitious
nonsense
she
cried
vehemently
be
happy
you
be
happy
the
world
must
not
lose
your
art
will
save
her
face
was
glorified
the
cost
to
yourself
he
faltered
will
pay
the
price
you
love
me
for
me
to
ruin
your
life
would
be
she
drew
his
head
to
her
bosom
and
smoothed
back
the
curly
hair
from
his
forehead
dear
my
dear
she
murmured
he
gulped
back
the
lump
in
his
throat
this
is
not
sin
you
have
redeemed
me
i
never
felt
so
at
peace
with
all
things
he
said
in
low
religious
tones
we
will
shame
the
world
we
will
live
high
and
true
our
happiness
shall
radiate
to
all
that
sorrows
and
suffers
our
home
shall
be
the
home
of
art
it
shall
stand
open
to
all
the
young
artists
striving
faithfully
in
poverty
it
shall
be
a
centre
of
blessing
suffering
has
made
me
morose
now
i
feel
at
one
with
my
kind
longing
to
do
my
truest
work
oh
god
bless
you
my
a
startled
look
of
alarm
had
come
into
her
face
she
loosed
her
embrace
of
him
matt
we
can
not
have
a
he
had
a
chill
of
apprehension
which
even
the
sweetness
of
that
first
clipping
of
his
name
could
not
counteract
we
love
each
other
she
waved
her
hands
agitatedly
world
would
spurn
me
will
spurn
the
but
you
are
not
thinking
who
would
come
to
the
house
how
is
it
to
be
a
centre
of
blessing
will
win
the
respect
what
you
and
i
are
we
not
strong
enough
you
with
your
noble
past
i
who
come
from
nothing
and
have
won
talk
like
a
dreamer
a
poet
and
i
love
you
for
it
but
you
do
not
know
the
world
how
it
ignores
the
realities
of
i
know
the
canting
hypocrisy
that
puts
its
faith
in
shows
and
honors
loveless
marriage
i
will
teach
it
to
respect
a
home
of
love
and
the
work
that
is
its
fruit
you
are
right
happiness
is
the
mother
of
art
oh
how
i
shall
work
now
my
dear
may
overtop
raphael
you
will
never
be
a
royal
has
my
private
life
to
do
with
art
with
art
but
everything
with
english
art
you
will
lose
your
shall
gain
she
shook
her
head
not
gain
both
but
you
say
it
is
impossible
do
not
say
so
what
need
is
there
to
wear
our
hearts
upon
our
sleeves
she
touched
his
sleeve
now
insinuating
caressing
fingers
you
see
how
hard
it
would
be
for
me
to
bear
i
am
not
a
man
the
worst
of
the
scorn
would
be
for
me
society
is
very
hard
upon
those
who
will
not
be
unconventional
in
secret
i
have
not
your
courage
and
strength
you
will
not
shame
he
weakened
i
am
thoughtless
he
said
and
stood
miserable
unconscious
of
the
caressing
fingers
then
his
brow
lightened
knows
married
if
we
came
back
and
set
up
house
together
people
would
think
we
had
been
married
she
put
her
hands
to
her
face
with
a
desperate
gesture
but
i
could
not
bear
olive
to
his
heart
leaped
herbert
told
her
married
she
is
a
fine
she
would
be
sure
to
learn
it
one
day
it
would
leak
she
would
keep
the
she
shook
her
head
know
olive
she
said
from
between
her
palms
is
hard
on
women
i
would
have
sat
to
you
ages
ago
only
i
was
afraid
of
her
sneers
i
have
her
know
for
worlds
i
used
to
think
her
now
that
she
is
to
be
married
will
be
more
conventional
than
he
tossed
back
his
hair
impatiently
we
must
dispense
with
for
a
long
time
she
did
not
reply
he
thought
his
harshness
towards
her
friend
had
set
her
crying
again
he
gently
forced
her
hands
from
her
face
it
was
flushed
and
me
i
have
hurt
you
he
said
in
contrition
you
do
not
understand
and
olive
has
been
so
good
to
me
she
takes
charge
of
all
my
affairs
she
hesitated
even
know
what
my
income
is
with
a
pathetic
engaging
smile
i
have
an
income
at
all
and
afraid
i
spend
a
great
he
straightened
his
shoulders
am
very
glad
of
that
i
will
work
for
you
i
can
wring
gold
from
the
rapid
calculations
flashed
through
his
mind
already
he
regretted
his
last
inactivity
the
destruction
of
his
picture
she
was
blushing
adorably
i
could
not
take
anything
from
you
if
we
lived
apart
no
from
me
oh
eleanor
then
we
must
make
our
home
i
tell
you
that
is
impossible
she
said
almost
pettishly
on
the
brink
of
tears
world
would
get
to
know
the
truth
there
is
that
ruth
hailey
you
spoke
of
who
knows
your
brother
and
who
through
her
connection
with
linda
verder
gets
brought
into
contact
with
all
sorts
of
people
and
your
wife
would
hear
of
it
too
unscrupulous
persons
would
egg
her
on
to
move
there
would
be
blackmailing
everything
sordid
and
she
shuddered
violently
you
do
not
know
the
world
you
have
lived
with
your
eyes
shut
fixed
on
inward
he
opened
them
now
startled
to
find
himself
lectured
for
want
of
worldliness
by
this
ethereal
creature
she
dissipated
his
uneasy
bewilderment
by
a
swift
transition
her
face
dimpled
itself
with
reassuring
smiles
she
pulled
the
little
curly
lock
at
his
forehead
with
a
fascinating
tug
be
such
a
quixote
dear
there
is
time
enough
to
plan
out
the
future
circumstances
may
change
her
face
saddened
poor
creature
may
be
taken
and
your
idea
may
seem
more
plausible
when
i
have
got
used
to
it
you
come
with
a
rush
and
a
crash
like
those
waves
that
she
smiled
wistfully
i
am
only
a
woman
and
timid
you
see
i
have
been
frightened
to
death
all
this
last
of
me
with
a
pathetic
smile
of
olive
twenty
times
i
thought
i
caught
her
if
she
does
come
she
be
surprised
to
see
me
but
i
have
a
plan
it
will
be
safest
if
she
know
in
paris
at
all
you
must
leave
me
at
his
heart
sank
when
do
i
see
you
sunday
whole
week
the
sunlight
seemed
gone
sunday
morning
olive
goes
to
brussels
for
a
few
days
only
waiting
to
finish
that
statuette
of
fate
it
weird
all
those
things
there
are
handiwork
how
clever
she
is
i
only
do
the
menial
work
of
pouring
in
the
plaster
it
saves
money
because
yes
he
interrupted
impatiently
on
sunday
evening
will
call
for
me
here
say
about
seven
you
will
take
me
to
dinner
somewhere
quiet
in
this
great
free
she
made
a
great
circle
with
her
arms
as
if
enjoying
the
then
she
smiled
intoxicatingly
we
can
talk
over
the
her
eyes
looked
heavenly
promise
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
this
time
she
struggled
away
no
she
may
be
back
at
any
moment
i
hear
footsteps
you
must
she
pushed
him
towards
the
door
i
write
olive
would
see
the
the
footsteps
passed
by
he
looked
back
in
reluctant
farewell
as
he
fumbled
at
the
she
was
close
behind
him
she
opened
her
arms
and
his
head
was
on
her
breast
again
my
dear
my
dear
she
murmured
is
hard
to
then
she
pushed
him
outside
her
face
grown
spiritual
again
in
its
anxiety
and
she
slammed
the
door
and
he
reeled
like
a
drunken
man
her
last
look
haunted
him
soulful
alluring
intoxicating
he
was
almost
sobbing
with
happiness
heaven
had
been
kind
to
him
at
last
the
balmy
air
of
the
fanned
his
brow
he
walked
on
aimlessly
in
a
beatific
dream
past
the
beautiful
ionic
portico
through
the
corridor
into
the
street
no
longer
grimy
and
so
on
to
the
boulevards
how
happy
the
world
was
how
the
sunshine
streamed
with
its
dancing
motes
how
gay
the
kiosks
with
their
dainty
posters
and
the
piquant
designs
of
great
caricaturists
laughing
from
the
front
pages
of
the
illustrated
journals
how
those
bourgeois
drinking
red
wine
at
the
tables
what
a
jolly
old
cabman
that
was
who
hailed
him
not
knowing
he
had
quicksilver
in
his
veins
and
must
needs
give
his
limbs
to
lively
motion
he
sauntered
on
at
random
buoyant
treading
on
sunbeams
a
song
at
his
heart
breathing
in
the
sense
of
the
spacious
airy
city
that
sparkled
in
the
spring
sunshine
mother
of
nimble
spirits
he
crossed
the
river
glittering
in
a
long
sweep
with
notre
dame
rising
on
its
island
in
picturesque
antiquity
the
on
the
quays
thrilled
him
with
a
remembrance
of
the
joys
of
reading
he
strode
on
humming
a
merry
tune
the
bustle
of
traffic
was
a
musical
accompaniment
to
it
he
stopped
at
a
great
leafy

strolled
along
absorbing
noble
buildings

churches
and

monuments
how
fair
life
was
how
marvellously
compacted
gladness
was
at
the
heart
of
all
things
the
city
passed
into
his
soul
as
never
before
its
radiant
message
of
elegance
proportion
style
sanity
unity
lucidity
exquisite
sensibility
to
the
material
balanced
by

without

would
be
fixed
at

swinging
steadily
on
a
pivot
of
happiness
a
lover
of
life
and
a
praiser
thereof
all

saw

oh
life

had

besmirched
the

with
soilures
of
cynicism
plaguing
the
air
with
pessimistic

graceless
grunts
of

nosing

what
good
times
he
had
had
himself
he
who
had
won
fame
and
gold
while
still
young
and
how
ungraciously
he
had
accepted
these
gifts
of
the
gods
mewling
and
whining
like
a
sulky
child
surely
he
deserved
that
hell
allotted
in
dante
for
those
who
had
wilfully
lived
in
sadness
the
gracious
romance
of
life
that
was
what
his
art
should
henceforth
interpret
he
began
to
dream
beautiful
masterpieces
and
they
reminded
him
that
he
had
come
to
see
the
salon
he
retraced
his
steps
towards
the
champs
elysées
watching
the
endless
procession
of
elegant
equipages
rolling
steadily
to
and
from
the
bois
with
their
panorama
of
luxurious
women
he
entered
the
salon
the
pictures
delighted
him
the
crowd
enraptured
him
a
young
face
stirred
him
to
a
mood
of
paternal
benediction
he
met
edward
cornpepper
there
and
felt
the
little
man
was
his
dearest
friend
cornpepper
introduced
him
to
his
wife
who
said
the
exhibition
was
indecent
are
right
my
dear
there

decent

cornpepper
chuckled
grimacing
to
adjust
his
monocle
and
feeling
his
round
beard

glory

departed
from

only
chaps
who
can

unabated
affection

went
to
his
hotel
to

gay
with
lounging
lolling
visitors
the
fountain
in
the
centre
leaped
and
sparkled
with
changing
colors
like
an
effervescence
of
the
city
far
into
the
night
he
sat
out
on
the
balcony
of
his
bedroom
gazing
at
the
beautiful
boulevards
stretching
serenely
away
in
the
moonlight
between
their
gigantic

chapter
ix
ruth
hailey
how
he
lived
through
the
rest
of
the
week
he
never
definitely
remembered
he
would
have
willingly
given
the
days
away
but
as
they
had
to
be
filled
up
somehow
they
left
confused
recollections
of
theatres
and
ballets
of
rencontres
with
random
acquaintances
of
riding
on
tiny
to
see
the
zoological
garden
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
of
wandering
in
a
of
reading
modern
french
poetry
of
visiting
the
ateliers
of
french
painters
whom
he
knew
and
sympathizing
with
their
grumbles
against
the
institute
and
the
distribution
of
decorations
while
wondering
inwardly
why
these
overgrown
languished
and
died
for
lack
of
a
bit
of
ribbon
what
could
a
man
want
in
life
but
to
paint
and
to
love
state
recognition
bah
the
artist
was
always
an
anarchist
he
stood
alone
he
hobnobbed
with
students
too
in
his
new
sympathy
with
youth
and
art
and
a
distinguished
visitor
was
taken
through
the
great
ateliers
with
their
dados
of
and
the
announcements
in
every
european
language
that
must
pay
for
drinks
he
gladly
accepted
a
ticket
for
a
ball
on
the
saturday
night
it
had
been
postponed
for
a
few
weeks
through
the
death
of
a
beloved
professor
he
had
heard
much
of
these
balls
but
had
never
seen
one
and
he
counted
upon
it
to
while
away
that
last
intolerable
night
between
him
and
his
happiness
several
times
during
the
week
he
had
thought
of
going
to
see
ruth
hailey
in
accordance
with
the
duty
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
had
seemed
so
pressing
but
he
shrank
instinctively
from
the
raking
up
of
memories
of
the
old
unhappy
days
at
this
joyous
crisis
he
was
not
in
the
mood
for
extraneous
emotion
nevertheless
on
the
saturday
afternoon
partly
for
want
of
anything
better
to
do
partly
to
keep
up
to
himself
the
pretence
that
she
was
at
least
one
of
the
motives
that
brought
him
to
paris
and
partly
to
ascertain
if
she
had
spoken
to
people
in
england
about
his
wife
he
set
out
to
pay
the
visit
he
would
feel
how
the
ground
lay
discover
if
she
had
innocently
betrayed
him
to
anybody
who
might
touch
circle
which
might
be
awkward
if
in
a
possible
compromise
eleanor
should
ever
decide
to
live
with
him
in
ostensible
marriage
he
had
a
dim
unformed
idea
of
appealing
to
ruth
for
silence
but
he
did
not
really
meditate
invoking
her
sympathies
she
was
on
the
eve
of
departing
for
the
antipodes
was
perhaps
already
gone
he
found
her
hotel
it
was
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
a
waiter
took
up
his
name
and
forthwith
brought
back
word
that
mademoiselle
would
see
monsieur
strang
his
heart
was
throbbing
curiously
as
he
mounted
the
stairs
and
stood
outside
her
door
the
quick
irregular
clack
clack
of
a
responded
like
an
echo
he
was
ushered
into
a
large
his
first
vision
was
of
a
tall
comely
lady
in
a
grayish
gown
writing
at
a
table
opposite
the
door
but
this
was
effaced
by
the
slimmer
figure
of
a
younger
woman
approaching
from
the
right
with
a
smile
of
welcome
and
an
extended
hand
a
moment
later
her
smile
had
faded
and
her
hand
was
on
her
heart
soothing
its
flutter
he
was
shaken
to
his
depths
behind
all
the
bodily
changes
he
saw
the
little
of
his
childhood
and
indeed
the
purity
of
her
limpid
truthful
gaze
was
undimmed
he
cried
in
alarm
moving
forward
as
if
to
sustain
her
she
drew
herself
up
rigid
and
frozen
then
her
face
relaxed
suffused
by
a
wan
smile
and
a
returning
flood
of
carmine
she
held
out
her
hand
with
a
nervous
laugh
are
you
strang
i
thought
it
was
billy
and
to
see
you
instead
startled
as
he
took
the
little
hand
and
looked
into
her
face
maturer
than
its
years
though
it
had
not
lost
its
olden
charm
especially
in
the
complexion
which
was
marvellously
pure
and
soft
registering
every
slightest
change
of
thought
and
feeling
in
dainty
flickers
of
rose
across
its
delicate
fairness
his
soul
was
invaded
by
a
rush
of
tender
memories
incongruously
jostling
in
his
brain
the
thrills
and
raptures
of
boyhood
the
joys
of
coasting
down
the
slopes
and
snaring
rabbits
and
shooting
partridges
the
glow
of
skating
the
delicious
taste
of
the
cakes
the
songs
and
hymns
of
childhood
the
firelight
casting
shadows
on
the
dusky
walls
while
his
mother
read
the
bible
the
drone
of
the
preacher
in
the
little
wooden
the
thwacking
of
the
feet
in
the
barn
the
odors
of
hay
and
the
lowing
of
cattle
the
gleam
of
the
mullein
by
the
wayside
and
the
smell
of
the
wild
flowers
in
the
woods
the
note
of
the
whippoorwill
in
the
forest
at
twilight
the
long
cranes
floating
over
the
summer
marshes
the
buzz
of
fresh
young
voices
in
all
these
came
back
dear
and
desirable
steeped
in
tears
softened
by
distance
to
a
pensive
beauty
like
bawling
choruses
heard
from
afar
across
still
water
inextricably
interwoven
with
all
the
pieties
of
childhood
the
simple
sense
of
god
and
truth
and
honor
and
righteousness
he
stood
holding
her
hand
oblivious
of
the
present
in
a
whirling
chaos
of
ancient
images
that
melted
his
soul
to
childish
tenderness
and
brought
back
to
it
the
clear
unquestioning
perception
of
spiritual
ideas
which
had
grown
shadowy
in
the
atmosphere
of
salons
and
studios
and
fashionable
churches
that
stereoscopic
vision
of
the
saint
and
the
child
which
sees
the
spiritual
solid
but
ruth
disengaged
her
fingers
at
last
blushing
under
the
kindly
smile
of
the
comely
lady
is
matthew
strang
linda
she
said
strang
let
me
introduce
you
to
he
bowed
i
have
heard
of
linda
verder
he
said
smiling
i
have
heard
more
of
matthew
strang
she
replied
beamingly
is
scarcely
possible
he
murmured
she
laughed
with
a
trill
i
alluding
merely
to
your
public
career
though
our
sweet
ruth
has
gotten
a
whole
album
full
of
about
that
but
it
is
of
you
yourself
and
your
childhood
that
i
have
heard
so
much
so
you
see
i
the
advantage
of
you
but
you
will
excuse
me
i
know
i
have
to
go
out
you
bother
about
those
letters
dear
nearly
through
with
and
with
an
affectionate
nod
to
ruth
and
a
beneficent
smile
to
matthew
she
left
the
room
he
was
reddening
he
was
beginning
to
feel
uncomfortable
under
smiles
which
in
their
insinuation
of
old
sweetheartship
made
it
certain
that
ruth
had
never
mentioned
his
marriage
to
her
friend
even
to
hear
that
the
forgotten
ruth
had
been
following
his
career
all
those
years
gave
him
an
odd
pathetic
shiver
she
and
billy
and
heaven
knew
what
others
were
sunning
themselves
in
the
mere
reflected
rays
of
that
fame
which
had
left
him
cold
she
stood
away
from
him
shy
and
equally
embarrassed
the
blood
ebbing
and
flowing
in
the
pure
soft
cheek
you
sit
down
she
said
at
last
thank
you
he
replied
and
took
a
distant
chair
she
sat
down
behind
her
facing
him
there
was
a
silence
she
was
the
first
to
break
it
was
so
sorry
to
read
you
were
it
was
nothing
he
murmured
am
so
pleased
we
left
we
are
sailing
next
tuesday
it
is
so
good
of
you
to
come
and
see
me
with
the
many
claims
that
you
must
have
on
your
is
a
pleasure
to
be
reminded
of
old
times
i
was
sorry
i
missed
you
the
time
you
called
at
my
house
he
said
awkwardly
was
very
sorry
you
know
i
work
at
my
studio
he
explained
trying
not
to
flush
is
no
room
at
i
know
but
i
care
to
call
there
and
interrupt
your
work
billy
showed
me
the
little
room
where
you
used
to
work
in
the
olden
days
i
thought
it
real
nice
of
you
to
turn
it
into
a
study
for
him
and
to
take
care
of
him
as
you
are
doing
he
sent
me
a
story
of
his
no
it
very
good
poor
fellow
she
added
seeing
the
question
in
his
face
too
full
of
passionate
published
in
manuscript
i
returned
it
to
him
he
was
enraptured
he
said
it
was
like
seeing
himself
in
we
are
not
so
used
to
the
as
you
is
coming
in
fast
though
even
into
your
slow
old
country
if
you
consider
it
yours
she
added
slyly
am
delighted
to
see
how
many
offices
the
machine
has
crept
into
in
two
years
it
will
be
in
every
business
delighted
have
you
or
verder
shares
in
the
patent
no
she
said
gently
you
see
it
is
a
new
occupation
for
women
he
smiled
i
remember
your
not
hobby
strang
not
hobby
it
is
my
but
i
expect
you
to
sympathize
with
these
sordid
practical
things
she
said
smiling
life
is
devoted
to
the
gospel
of
the
but
i
do
sympathize
he
cried
remorsefully
think
it
is
very
fine
of
she
shook
her
head
her
smile
fading
you
you
are
outside
the
circle
of
the
material
worries
of
the
poor
or
what
is
worse
the
genteel
and
nobody
but
a
woman
can
know
the
tragic
pettiness
of
the
for
single
girls
the
stifled
aspirations
the
abortive
longings
the
tears
in
the
night
christ
would
have
understood
but
he
was
not
a
he
saw
the
blur
of
emotion
veil
her
eyes
ere
she
turned
her
head
hastily
away
he
felt
his
own
sight
growing
dim
an
understratum
of
his
consciousness
admired
the
flow
of
her
language
and
divined
platform
experiences
he
had
never
before
thought
of
her
as
clever
she
recovered
herself
in
a
moment
and
resumed
playfully
if
you
were
a
artist
you
would
have
sketched
verder
with
corkscrew
ringlets
and
crying
for
trousers
we
do
want
the
franchise
and
the
right
to
dress
as
we
please
but
these
are
only
incidental
aspects
of
the
movement
for
the
independence
of
women
though
they
lend
themselves
most
readily
to
caricature
the
woman
of
the
future
is
simply
the
working
woman
all
we
really
want
is
to
make
girls
economically
independent
of
marriage
able
to
choose
their
mates
from
love
instead
of
selling
themselves
for
a
he
could
not
meet
her
frank
eyes
he
was
suddenly
reminded
of
his
own
marriage
what
would
this
stainless
soul
think
of
him
if
she
knew
he
had
sold
himself
or
worse
if
she
knew
why
he
had
come
to
her
this
afternoon
he
murmured
surveying
the
carpet
that
he
knew
life
was
hard
for
girls
but
that
he
hoped
she
at
least
had
not
been
unhappy
oh
been
as
happy
as
the
next
girl
though
had
my
trials
she
said
cheerily
between
smiles
and
tears
i
am
grateful
to
god
for
them
else
i
should
never
have
learned
to
sympathize
as
i
do
and
i
should
not
have
served
the
master
my
life
might
have
been
wasted
in
mere
mere
happiness
the
phrase
went
through
him
like
a
sword
had
no
need
to
work
for
a
living
he
said
dubiously
i
had
i
had
had
a
a
kind
but
i
quarrelled
with
him
you
heard
that
of
he
had
heard
of
it
of
course
but
her
affairs
had
made
trivial
dints
upon
his
consciousness
did
you
quarrel
with
him
he
asked
her
face
became
a
crimson
mask
she
lowered
her
head
i
beg
your
pardon
he
stammered
in
distress
course
i
had
no
right
to
she
was
silent
her
fingers
nervously
picking
out
letters
on
the
then
her
eyes
met
his
unflinchingly
again
in
a
way
you
have
a
right
to
ask
she
said
uneasily
see
why
i
tell
you
so
long
ago
you
know
i
became
the
he
nodded
wondering
made
me
keep
all
his
accounts
i
learned
all
about
his
affairs
well
one
day
looking
over
the
books
i
made

she
hesitated
her
face
was
still
fiery
the
image
of
the
mumbling
deacon
with
the
roundabout
methods
of
arriving
at
his
point
rose
vivid
to
his
memory
he
remembered
his
childish
strain
to
understand
good
advice
pop
pop
pop
it
was
like
the
clack
clack
clack
of
the
under
nervous
unconscious
fingers
but
what
was
this
she
was
saying
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
erratic
automatic
music
discovered
that
he
was
cheating
you
or
rather
your
sister
and
abner
preep
that
he
had
always
bamboozled
your
father
that
the
mortgage
was
more
than
paid
off
long
before
aside
from
the
work
he
had
gotten
out
of
your
brothers
and
she
paused
then
hastened
on
with
a
lighter
tone
of
course
being
a
foolish
girl
i
stay
any
longer
in
his
house
unless
he
repaid
you
and
equally
of
course
he
refused
knowing
i
make
a
scandal
and
so
i
went
off
to
the
only
relative
i
had
in
the
world
my
sister
in
portland
maine
she
was
too
poor
to
give
me
more
than
food
and
shelter
but
my
knowledge
of
soon
got
me
a
place
in
a
store
and
ever
since
i
have
earned
my
own
bread
heaven
be
she
was
not
looking
at
him
now
her
fingers
were
still
lightly
tapping
the
letters
into
combinations
that
spelled
only
embarrassment
i
to
have
told
you
but
you
take
action
now
will
you
seeing
that
the
money
has
been
paid
he
cried
hoarsely
with
a
sudden
intuition
he
sprang
up
agitatedly
sent
us
all
that
money
anonymously
from
maine
her
head
drooped
lower
i
felt
i
to
say
anything
she
cried
in
vexation
you
did
you
was
such
a
trifle
anyhow
she
said
deprecatingly
was
a
fortune
then
five
hundred
dollars
could
do
no
less
there
was
no
other
call
for
the
money
i
earned
in
those
first
few
years
while
my
aunt
still
lived
and
i
thought
that
perhaps
he
came
towards
her
perhaps
that
perhaps
it
might
help
you
in
your
career
my
aunt
corresponded
with
my
poor
friends
in
cobequid
village
i
knew
how
you
were
slaving
and
sending
money
to
your
bless
you
hope
it
was
a
little
help
to
you
he
thrilled
under
the
name
spoken
for
the
first
time
have
often
liked
to
think
it
was
that
i
had
a
wee
finger
in
the
making
of
a
great
her
words
cut
him
to
the
heart
how
could
he
tell
her
that
her
money
had
come
too
late
he
was
about
to
murmur
something
but
she
stopped
him
answer
me
for
fear
you
should
dispel
my
illusion
it
has
been
such
a
joy
to
me
when
i
read
about
your
rapid
rise
to
say
to
myself
perhaps
know
but
half
the
joy
was
in
the
secrecy
now
you
have
found
me
out
take
away
the
relics
of
my
why
should
you
bother
to
read
things
about
me
he
murmured
only
half
sincerely
for
another
and
more
agitating
suspicion
was
fast
germinating
in
his
breast
she
flashed
a
quick
glance
up
at
him
as
he
stood
over
her
then
looked
down
again
indifferently
her
sweet
mouth
quivering
why
should
i
not
be
proud
of
knowing
if
only
in
boyhood
the
only
great
man
our
township
ever
produced
but
he
had
now
been
trained
in
looks
rosina
and
eleanor
had
taught
him
much
and
the
thought
that
was
borne
in
upon
him
now
the
conviction
that
ruth
too
loved
him
that
she
had
always
cherished
her
childish
affection
though
his
own
had
been
swamped
by
his
craving
for
art
was
not
the
complacent
conviction
of
a
coxcomb
it
was
a
chilling
agony
it
pierced
his
breast
like
a
jagged
icicle
he
had
an
appalling
sense
as
of
responsibility
for
a
ruined
life
the
image
of
flashed
suddenly
before
him
careworn
faded
unlovely
was
that
to
be
the
end
of
ruth
the
sweet
playmate
the
great
soul
you
too
have
done
something
in
life
he
said
as
if
to
reassure
himself
trying
to
curve
his
trembling
lips
to
a
smile
she
looked
up
frankly
at
him
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
help
linda
to
help
other
do
you
meditate
helping
linda
all
your
life
he
essayed
to
smile
again
if
you
marry
but
i
marry
she
said
quickly
and
kept
her
face
bravely
raised
to
his
though
the
rose
was
coming
and
going
on
her
transparent
skin
his
smile
was
a
ghastly
caricature
spite
the
caricaturists
she
smiled
a
faint
response
even
for
that
has
not
linda
sacrificed
herself
on
that
altar
true
a
widow
but
still
he
could
not
help
asking
the
question
why
you
marry
i
want
to
is
that
a
reason
and
she
smiled
again
he
cried
frenziedly
in
a
strange
mixture
of
emotions
am
not
worthy
to
kneel
to
you
she
opened
her
eyes
wondering
i
prefer
celibacy
because
my
life
is
happy
enough
as
it
is
because
thanks
to
verder
it
is
sufficiently
filled
with
activity
and
movement
if
it
is
if
it
is
he
cried
almost
hysterically
it
is
you
men
are
all
so
mistaken
about
women
marriage
may
be
a
necessity
for
some
women
but
not
for
all
oh
thank
god
not
for
all
it
may
be
harder
for
linda
who
has
known
a
love
but
for
me
oh
i
am
perfectly
she
rose
and
moved
away
from
him
and
began
to
walk
restlessly
up
and
down
talking
rapidly
is
perfectly
absurd
this
making
marriage
and
happiness
synonyms
novels
end
with
marriage
and
that
is
called
a
happy
ending
good
heavens
it
is
quite
as
often
an
unhappy
beginning
if
you
had
seen
the
things
i
have
seen
heard
the
tales
women
have
told
me
even
the
women
you
would
imagine
the
most
enviable
are
full
of
worries
why
look
at
your
own
wife
strang
who
has
everything
to
make
her
and
her
lips
parted
in
a
faint
smile
he
turned
his
face
away
she
also
tell
you
tales
of
woe
he
said
with
a
forced
laugh
not
precisely
woe
but
plenty
of
anxiety
about
the
children
and
about
the
dishonesty
of
her
helps
and
she
seemed
rather
poorly
too
i
hope
you
left
her
strong
and
you
he
murmured
flushing
proud
she
is
of
you
ruth
went
on
was
so
glad
to
find
that
she
really
appreciated
you
i
had
often
wondered
and
it
only
on
account
of
your
importance
matthew
strang
she
told
me
you
were
goodness
itself
which
of
course
i
knew
and
that
you
had
long
wished
her
to
move
to
a
better
neighborhood
only
she
was
afraid
to
put
you
to
expense
what
a
good
woman
she
must
be
and
so
pretty
too
you
think
so
he
muttered
his
face
was
still
averted
and
i
seem
to
remember
her
in
your
earliest
pictures
the
woman
in
she
think
she
sat
for
the
figure
he
said
hesitatingly
afford
models
then
i
wish
you
going
so
soon
i
should
so
like
to
do
a
sketch
of
you
something
to
remember
you
she
shook
her
head
have
so
much
to
do
this
week
i
have
am
sorry
perhaps
we
shall
never
meet
again
he
said
in
low
tones
never
even
had
a
photograph
of
you
i
could
do
a
sketch
from
think
i
have
any
you
did
a
sketch
of
me
once
she
reminded
him
not
going
to
give
you
that
precious
an
example
of
your
first
the
gay
note
in
her
voice
sounded
rather
strained
you
remember
you
sent
it
me
when
you
first
went
to
halifax
please
remember
how
many
years
but
he
did
remember
and
he
remembered
too
how
he
had
sent
it
her
as
a
slight
return
for
the
he
had
lost
her
gift
through
the
carelessness
of
jack
floss
very
soon
after
but
she
cherished
his
still
he
moved
to
her
side
watching
her
rummage
among
heaps
of
papers
he
saw
the
backs
of
two
photographs
and
picked
them
up
one
was
a
portrait
of
linda
verder
the
other
of
himself
public
celebrities
she
said
with
a
little
confused
laugh
never
attained
to
the
so
naturally
i
am
she
continued
her
search
and
at
last
turned
up
something
an
old
one
or
rather
a
young
one
me
at
sixteen
goodness
to
think
still
got
that
his
flaccid
nerves
sent
fresh
moisture
to
his
eyes
as
he
gazed
at
the
simple
picture
of
the
sweet
delicate
girlish
face
with
large
eyes
luminous
with
dreams
looking
out
shyly
upon
life
in
a
sort
of
wistful
wonder
and
expectation
unconscious
unprophetic
of
the
blank
years
when
eyes
grow
dim
with
sudden
unsought
tears
his
voice
was
broken
as
he
said
you
this
is
the
picture
i
would
most
have
wished
to
have
henceforward
i
shall
think
of
you
earnest
truthful
aspiring
as
you
have
thought
of
me
all
these
years
and
now
i
suppose
i
must
not
keep
you
any
longer
from
your
they
are
nothing
it
is
your
time
that
is
precious
i
know
i
am
rejoiced
to
have
had
this
glimpse
of
you
in
your
fame
and
happiness
i
shall
always
remember
this
afternoon
she
held
out
her
hand
he
put
his
with
the
portrait
behind
his
back
i
he
said
petulantly
if
you
call
me
she
dropped
her
hand
with
a
sad
smile
see
i
belong
to
the
rejected
he
quivered
as
at
a
thrust
you
are
of
the
elect
of
the
saints
of
this
her
smile
took
on
the
wistfulness
of
her
early
portrait
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
a
tender
embarrassment
matt
you
will
not
mind
my
speaking
of
her
she
belongs
to
me
a
little
as
well
as
to
you
you
know
i
went
to
see
your
poor
mother
before
i
left
for
he
shuddered
she
recognize
you
he
said
in
a
she
shook
her
head
her
face
was
drawn
with
the
pain
of
the
memory
she
is
quite
gentle
except
when
she
quotes
texts
they
give
her
simple
housework
to
do
it
provides
a
vent
for
her
activity
marriages
are
not
always
happy
you
a
wan
smile
flitted
across
her
features
shall
go
to
see
her
again
poor
creature
i
forgot
her
when
i
called
you
happy
the
thought
of
her
must
always
sadden
he
would
not
trust
his
voice
to
reply
he
transferred
the
photograph
to
his
left
hand
and
held
out
the
right
in
silence
she
put
her
hand
into
his
matt
perhaps
he
struggled
to
speak
he
bent
nearer
i
not
kiss
you
for
auld
lang
syne
she
withdrew
her
hand
her
voice
was
tremulous
and
low
are
not
playmates
now
he
held
up
the
photograph
i
will
kiss
the
girl
i
used
to
he
pressed
his
lips
reverentially
to
it
she
smiled
sadly
again
dear
matt
god
bless
he
hurried
from
the
room
overwhelmed
with
emotion
the
door
closed
upon
him
and
he
leaned
against
the
balustrade
for
a
moment
to
recover
himself
clack
clack
clack
clack
clack
it
was
the
steady
clatter
of
determined
work
she
had
taken
up
the
burden
of
duty
again
chapter
x
the
master
he
half
groped
his
way
down
the
stairs
in
this
mist
of
tears
all
things
were
obscured
even
the
image
of
eleanor
wyndwood
no
one
thing
was
clear
the
figure
of
the
sweet
puritan
woman
with
her
simple
righteousness
he
emerged
into
the
rue
de
rivoli
with
its
pretentious
architecture
its
glittering
shop
windows
its
bustle
of
life
across
the
road
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
stretched
away
in
the
sunshine
but
the
gentle
figure
stood
between
him
and
paris
he
tried
to
shake
her
off
to
think
of
the
transcendent
raptures
that
awaited
him
on
the
morrow
he
tried
to
see
face
steadily
but
it
was
all
wavering
lines
like
a
reflection
in
water
he
bethought
himself
of
selecting
the
secluded
restaurant
and
hiring
the
private
room
for
the
dinner
but
the
figure
of
ruth
resurged
blotting
out
he
took
out
her
photograph
and
kissed
it
again
a
little
angel
he
cried
aloud
and
then
from
that
chaos
of
ancient
memories
freshly
stirred
up
came
like
an
echo
mad
cry
a
little
angel
a
girl
passing
him
laughed
in
his
face
and
he
put
away
the
portrait
flushing
and
chilled
to
the
marrow
he
told
himself
he
must
soak
himself
in
paris
and
forget
her
he
walked
towards
the
grand
boulevards
trying
vainly
to
absorb
and
assimilate
the
gayety
of
the
streets
he
returned
to
his
hotel
and
dressed
and
dined
with
dainty
dishes
and
sparkling
wines
such
as
herbert
himself
would
have
recommended
but
the
quivering
roots
of
his
being
had
been
laid
bare
his
soul
vibrated
with
intangible
memories
and
the
image
of
ruth
still
possessed
his
imagination
the
candid
eyes
the
pure
skin
as
ever
his
soul
was
touched
through
the
concrete
after
dinner
he
wandered
about
the
gay
city
adding
the
red
of
his
to
the
feverish
dusk
athrob
with
a
myriad
stars
above
and
a
myriad
lights
below
the
soft
spring
air
was
charged
with
the
pleasurable
hum
of
ceaseless
pedestrians
the
theatres
and
and
dancing
places
blazoned
themselves
upon
the
night
the
great
restaurants
flared
within
and
without
their
pavement
tables
thronged
with
men
and
pretty
women
gossiping
laughing
clinking
glasses
women
everywhere
women
they
looked
out
even
from
the
illustrated
papers
of
the
illumined
kiosks
the
shining
city
seemed
to
waft
an
incense
of
pleasure
up
to
the
stars
to
breathe
out
an
aroma
of
sinless
voluptuousness
that
rose
like
a
for
life
his
heart
expanded
to
all
this
happiness
he
felt
himself
being
caught
up
by
the
great
joyous
wave
and
eleanor
face
came
back
radiant
and
seductive
but
ruth
hailey
was
still
at
his
side
and
ever
and
anon
he
saw
her
as
in
her
later
guise
stern
sorrowful
negativing
she
stood
out
against
the
whole
city
he
seated
himself
before
one
of
the
innumerable
little
marble
he
was
at
the
of
the
great
arteries
dominated
by
the
fulgent
façade
of
the
opera
house
where
he
could
watch
the
perpetual
currents
of
gladsome
life
he
observed
the
countless
couples
with
emotion
striving
to
concentrate
himself
on
the
thought
of
his
imminent
happiness
when
the
love
that
sustained
the
world
and
made
it
sustainable
should
be
his
at
last
when
he
should
become
as
other
men
living
the
natural
life
of
the
race
and
the
sexes
in
sympathetic
fusion
but
the
figure
of
ruth
hailey
stood
firm
amid
the
swirling
crowds
and
her
pure
eyes
shamed
his
thought
and
filled
his
breast
with
an
aching
tenderness
for
the
poor
human
atoms
he
had
deserted
for
rosina
for
billy
for
for
whom
there
was
no
happiness
and
no
natural
life
he
fought
against
this
obsession
of
spirit
he
struggled
to
fix
his
vision
on
the
glitter
and
the
gayety
but
he
had
to
see
her
standing
like
a
rock
or
a
tower
against
smiling
treacherous
seas
but
if
he
went
back
to
rosina
in
honorable
acknowledged
union
then
farewell
to
society
to
take
her
about
with
him
was
out
of
the
question
she
would
be
more
unhappy
than
he
in
those
high
glacial
latitudes
of
humanity
well
what
was
society
to
him
he
could
shake
it
off
as
easily
as
the
micmac
of
his
childhood
shook
off
the
clothes
of
christendom
to
be
shut
out
from
society
were
no
privation
for
him
he
had
the
advantage
of
his
who
sacrificed
at
its
shrine
and
were
sacrificed
to
it
he
could
couch
on
fir
boughs
he
had
lived
on
bread
and
water
this
constant
concern
with
wines
and
cookery
with
couches
and
carriages
this
gorging
and
gormandizing
and
did
it
add
dignity
to
life
was
it
worth
the
hecatomb
of
hearts
and
souls
offered
up
for
it
this
low
luxury
of
the
higher
classes
was
not
simplicity
the
note
of
greatness
in
life
as
in
art
and
howsoever
simple
the
complex
comfort
of
their
lives
might
seem
to
those
born
to
it
was
it
for
artists
to
imitate
this
lowest
side
of
the
upper
classes
especially
if
it
frittered
away
their
art
was
it
for
bohemia
to
ape
philistia
and
for
art
the
last
of
the
rebels
against
the
platitudinization
of
life
to
bow
the
knee
and
swear
allegiance
to
the
vulgar
ideals
of
fashion
they
had
drawn
him
even
from
boyhood
these
showy
ideals
from
the
days
when
he
had
peered
wistfully
into
the
at
halifax
but
he
was
done
with
boyhood
now
ah
but
if
he
went
back
to
rosina
and
the
new
thought
struck
a
chill
as
of
graveyard
damps
it
was
all
over
with
his
art
that
just
beginning
to
revive
under
the
inspiration
of
eleanor
wyndwood
would
be
a
sheer
impossibility
under
the
daily
oppression
of
rosina
with
her
kitchen
horizon
his
imagination
would
be
clogged
with
the
vapors
of
cabbage
and
of
the
old
bad
work
he
had
had
enough
he
would
retire
from
art
as
from
society
and
the
exhibitions
should
know
him
no
more
he
would
go
out
of
the
business
that
was
all
it
was
he
told
himself
with
a
bitter
smile
his
fame
was
a
bauble
a
bagatelle
for
all
it
mattered
to
him
it
might
have
been
his
dead
uncle
matthew
strang
whose
name
was
on
the
lips
of
strangers
there
was
still
work
in
the
world
for
an
honest
man
to
do
he
remembered
again
that
his
hands
could
wield
more
than
the
brush
besides
he
had
a
little
capital
now
rosina
had
still
her
income
perhaps
they
would
go
back
to
nova
scotia
and
buy
a
farm
they
would
sow
and
reap
far
from
the
glare
of
cities
and
the
sweet
simple
sun
and
rain
would
bless
the
work
of
their
hands
his
life
would
be
joyless
but
perchance
his
soul
would
be
at
peace
yes
but
to
give
up
art
art
which
was
the
meaning
of
his
life
life
stood
for
nothing
it
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
give
up
his
for
hers
had
he
not
suffered
enough
had
he
not
already
expiated
his
marriage
the
hapless
union
he
had
entered
into
when
distracted
by
illness
and
disgrace
and
hunger
when
perhaps
his
whole
future
had
hinged
such
were
the
turns
of
life
on
his
reluctance
to
change
his
last
two
dollars
he
rose
and
walked
about
restlessly
through
the
glistening
streets
everywhere
restaurants
tables
men
women
he
wandered
to
montmartre
more
restaurants
more
couples
cafés
cabarets
queer
entertainments
chat
noir
le
rat
the
red
sails
of
the
famous
mill
turning
tirelessly
lights
gayety
women
always
women
of
all
shades
of
prettiness
and
piquancy
with
rosy
cheeks
and
lips
not
always
painted
and
eyes
that
could
shine
without
bismuth
he
walked
back
through
the
grand
boulevards
they
were
one
flush
of
life
but
the
reasoning
was
inexorable
he
had
sacrificed
rosina
to
his
art
art
had
slipped
through
his
fingers
but
rosina
remained
none
the
less
sacrificed
now
his
art
must
be
sacrificed
to
rosina
the
atonement
was
logical
that
was
not
a
surrender
he
told
himself
angrily
to
ruth
view
of
life
a
view
whose
narrowness
he
and
everybody
around
him
had
outgrown
he
refused
to
recognize
in
the
face
of
this
radiant
paris
that
each
human
soul
came
into
the
world
to
sacrifice
its
happiness
to
other
human
souls
that
seemed
to
him
a
preposterous
paradox
rather
than
a
solution
a
world
of
reciprocal
was
an
absurdity
and
at
any
rate
if
such
were
the
scheme
of
creation
it
did
not
work
at
all
with
the
gross
run
of
mankind
to
say
nothing
of
animals
the
only
reason
for
going
back
to
rosina
must
be
honestly
to
fulfil
his
side
of
the
bargain
she
had
done
her
part
he
must
do
his
that
his
return
to
her
meant
the
ruin
of
his
life
and
his
was
not
her
concern
these
larger
issues
were
too
wide
for
her
comprehension
she
loved
her
husband
and
she
desired
him
that
was
enough
he
owed
himself
to
her
and
to
shirk
his
obligation
was
as
dishonorable
as
to
disown
a
debt
he
had
paid
off
the
stasborough
although
absolved
by
bankruptcy
he
must
be
equally
honorable
with
rosina
though
his
life
had
been
bankrupted
practically
his
art
had
always
been
sacrificed
to
her
it
was
her
pettiness
that
had
driven
him
to
produce
in
haste
for
the
market
so
as
to
escape
indebtedness
to
her
well
let
the
sacrifice
be
consummated
he
had
come
to
the
place
de
la
concorde
it
seemed
a
of
romantic
lights
a
dance
of
it
wooed
him
towards
the
calm
and
solitude
of
the
river
he
leaned
on
the
parapet
and
saw
the
sombre
water
stretching
away
in
marvellously
solemn
beauty
hushed
and
lonely
its
perspective
of
green
and
red
and
yellow
gleams
palpitating
in
the
air
dim
with
a
yearning
poetry
he
felt
the
presence
of
ruth
hailey
at
his
side
she
looked
like
the
photograph
now
he
held
her
little
hand
and
gazed
into
her
candid
eyes
good
god
this
girl
had
loved
him
all
those
long
years
and
would
be
hopelessly
faithful
even
unto
death
but
if
he
went
back
to
rosina
what
of
eleanor
wyndwood
would
he
spoil
her
life
too
and
more
culpably
than
he
had
spoiled
ruth
he
sighed
wearily
it
was
impossible
to
do
wrong
and
have
the
result
simple
life
was
so
intercomplicated
but
he
had
been
honest
with
eleanor
thank
heaven
she
knew
the
truth
about
his
life
he
would
be
honest
with
her
to
the
end
he
would
tell
her
the
truth
now
the
same
noble
uncalculating
simplicity
that
had
accorded
him
friendship
that
had
been
ready
to
give
him
love
would
bear
her
triumphantly
through
the
new
trial
he
remembered
her
brave
words
i
did
not
suffer
i
should
think
i
had
not
perhaps
there
would
be
consolation
for
both
in
the
thought
that
she
remained
unsullied
before
the
world
he
crossed
the
river
and
his
mood
changed
he
got
towards
the
latin
quarter
and
wandered
into
the
amid
the
restaurants
where
young
humanity
sat
in
its
couples
again
amorous
and
gay
every
place
was
full
within
and
without
and
there
was
the
gurgle
of
liquids
with
the
sounds
of
singing
and
laughter
he
was
back
again
amid
the
blithe
insouciant
life
of
the
eternal
undergraduate
with
the
local
variation
of
bocks
rakish
young
men
danced
through
the
restaurants
arm
in
arm
in
tipsy
merriment
poets
with
visages
and
tumbled
hair
imbibed
vermouth
clinking
glasses
with
their
mistresses
the
smoky
air
vibrated
with
irresponsible
gayety
it
was
full
of
invitations
to
careless
happiness
joyous
levity
forgetfulness
of
an
austere
view
of
life
puritanism
seemed
a
form
of
dementia
asceticism
a
sunless
folly
the
atmosphere
gained
upon
him
he
tossed
off
a
bock
then
walked
recklessly
past
studio
the
whole
was
in
darkness
but
he
thought
of
night
and
it
glowed
as
with
bonfires
of
joy
he
resolved
to
sup
famously
he
jumped
into
a
victoria
and
drove
to
a
fashionable
restaurant
it
was
near
midnight
the
theatres
had
emptied
but
the
streets
were
only
the
fuller
he
passed
through
rooms
full
of
dazzling
women
in
gorgeous
evening
costumes
sipping
champagne
women
always
women
the
city
blossomed
with
them
like
roses
he
ordered
some
oysters
and
chablis
and
forgot
to
eat
opposite
him
a
celebrity
of
the
footlights
blazing
with
diamonds
held
her
court
surrounded
by
a
bevy
of
dandies
behind
him
a
in
red
playfully
rapped
her
knuckles
at
the
next
table
the
exuberant
liveliness
of
a
supper
party
diverted
him
he
drank
drank
listening
greedily
to
the
gay
repartees
life
should
be
joy
joy
joy
he
thought
that
was
what
modern
life
lacked
gray
with
problems
wrinkled
with
thought
these
people
lived
lived
in
splendid
insolence
under
the
midnight
sun
there
was
a
touch
of
bigness
that
appealed
to
him
in
their
arrogant
vitality
society
was
an
organized
insipidity
afraid
of
life
the
figure
of
ruth
hailey
rose
rebuking
he
paid
the
bill
and
went
out
but
his
heart
cried
ached
for
happiness
ah
no
he
could
not
give
up
so
young
go
into
a
living
grave
he
roved
the
boulevards
again
the
beautiful
city
solicited
him
rouged
and
perfumed
clad
in
shining
garments
with
hair
but
the
virginal
figure
of
ruth
hailey
with
sweet
shy
eyes
stood
against
the
city
paris
seemed
garish
beside
her
he
was
fluctuating
again
it
seemed
as
if
the
simple
girl
would
draw
him
away
from
all
the
joys
of
life
was
there
no
means
of
ridding
himself
of
her
haunting
presence
a
grotesque
mask
looked
out
of
a
cab
ah
the
fancy
ball
he
had
forgotten
that
would
lay
the
ghost
of
his
disordered
imagination
he
felt
in
his
pocket
and
found
the
ticket
he
hastened
to
the
scene
of
revelry
a
clatter
of
cabs
and
a
blaze
of
lights
he
had
arrived
the
first
glimpse
within
was
exhilarating
provoking
dazzling
overwhelming
he
had
a
confused
sense
of
a
hall
of
a
thousand
lights
and
mirrors
reeking
with
scent
and
heat
reverberant
with
music
and
shrieks
and
laughter
white
with
the
whirling
gleam
of
women
and
motley
with
the
rainbow
hues
and
multiplied
reflections
of
male
masqueraders
a
mad
joyous
orgy
the
diabolical
medley
of
a
glittering
tinselled
pantomime
and
an
nightmare
ah
here
was
oblivion
of
ruth
hailey
at
last
and
he
eagerly
took
up
a
position
on
a
raised
platform
that
ran
along
the
side
of
the
gigantic
trying
to
catch
the
contagion
of
the
scene
and
ready
to
rush
into
the
heart
of
the
jollity
the
gleeful
palpitating
pageant
a
twisted
tangled
kaleidoscopic
rally
of
riotous
color
and
flesh
tones
tore
past
him
dancing
leaping
shrieking
wantoning
clowning
kissing
uncouth
as
the
gargoyles
of
notre
dame
and
brilliant
as
the
midnight
boulevard
japanese
figures
and
demons
gladiators
in
cuirasses
and
bathing
drawers
gallic
warriors
in
skins
brawny
barbarians
in
blankets
amazons
with
brass
breasts
a
savage
in
a
girdle
of
a
real
samoan
girl
with
hair
in
the
convoy
of
her
russian
lover
in
a
tall
white
hat
a
boy
as
a
german
girl
and
an
elderly
woman
as
a
gendarme
with
orange
blossoms
in
her
hair
one
man
with
a
helmet
crowned
by
a
black
cat
and
another
with

mock
broken
head
reddened
bandages
and
a
hideous

of

on
his
and

shining
with

and

little

all
content
to
take
life
as
a
flash
of
leaping
flame
flickering
out
to
an
early
darkness
and
as
they
danced
and
laughed
and
romped
and
shouted
the
fun
rose
to
hysterical
frenzy
four
masked
men
bore
the
queen
of
the
models
sinuous
in
complete
fleshings
niched
in
an
outspread
gigantic
fan
before
it
a
druid
and
a
bacchante
danced
backward
behind
it
seethed
a
vast
picturesque
procession
of
women
mounted
on
their
shoulders
smoking
cigarettes
and
waving
lighted
red
and
green
lanterns
at
its
sides
girls
pirouetted
frantically
foot
in
mouth
the
brazen
orchestra
clanged
the
procession
defiled
frolicking
round
and
round
the
hall
roaring
a
marching
chorus
a
wave
of
hysteria
ran
through
the
assembly
mighty
magnetic
compulsive
and
matthew
strang
waved
his
arms
and
shouted
and
sang
with
the
best
joy
joy
joy
this
was
your
true
artistic
interpretation
of
life
away
with
this
modern
morbidity
he
was
one
in
soul
with
all
the
great
artists
all
the
masters
who
had
had
their
royal
way
in
life
o
royal
eleanor
o
rare
eleanor
fit
mate
for
a
mighty
artist
then
supper
came
and
he
fought
for
some
in
the
balconies
amid
the
roar
of
voices
and
the
rattle
of
knives
and
the
shouts
for
the
maddened
waiters
and
the
indescribable
exhalations
of
food
and
wine
and
smoke
and
hot
air
and
scented
flesh
the
dancing
floor
was
littered
with
champagne
capsules
bits
of
lanterns
ends
of
cigarettes
fragments
of
dresses
spangles
morsels
of
fur
after
supper
the
frolic
grew
more
intoxicating
the
gayety
more
reckless
sweet
girls
gave
themselves
to
and
lascivious
movement
they
obliged
with
the
du
in
a
corner
a
woman
turned
somersaults
from
sheer
a
trundled
a
hoop
through
the
centre
of
the
room
a
band
of
fifty
dancers
with
joined
hands
ran
amuck
among
the
yelling
crowd
matthew
senses
ached
with
the
riot
of
color
and
the
rollick
of
figures
and
the
efflorescence
of
femininity
and
the
of
this
sabbath
and
then
a
strange
ancient
thought
struck
him
afresh
the
same
grotesque
thought
that
after
his
death
had
weighed
upon
his
childhood
very
soon
all
these
scintillating
whirling
figures
would
lie
still
and
cold
frozen
in
death
they
suddenly
became
nothing
but
marionettes
in
a
mechanism
destined
to
run
down
and
then
the
girlish
form
that
had
hovered
mistily
in
his
neighborhood
throughout
all
the
tumultuous
hours
grew
clear
again
and
against
this
pandemoniac
background
the
inexorable
figure
of
ruth
hailey
rose
simple
and
virginal
with
sweet
shy
eyes
when
he
came
back
to
consciousness
of
the
revellers
they
had
formed
a
human
amphitheatre
an
inner
circle
lying
on
the
ground
and
the
next
squatting
and
the
next
kneeling
and
the
next
half
standing
and
the
last
but
one
erect
and
the
last
of
all
surmounted
by
shouldered
girls
and
in
the
centre
of
this
human
amphitheatre
a
beautiful
young
nude
model
with
ruddy
brown
hair
struck
graceful
attitudes
the
cold
blue
light
of
dawn
fell
through
a
semicircular
window
overhead
and
mingled
weirdly
with
the
yellowish
electric
light
lending
a
strange
wan
unearthly
hue
to
all
these
painted
perspiring
faces
the
atmosphere
seemed
unbearably
mephitic
he
sallied
shamefacedly
into
the
street
it
was
sunday
morning
stainless
and
fresh
and
blue
the
sunrise
brooded
over
the
sleeping
city
in
sacred
splendor
the
sun
was
like
a
gigantic
bowl
of
pure
gold
with
a
refracted
cover
separated
from
it
by
a
rift
of
cloud
around
it
the
sky
was
dappled
with
lines
and
splashes
and
a
ring
or
two
of
pale
sulphur
ending
to
the
south
in
a
narrow
gulf
of
green
and
all
this
loveliness
of
color
was
spread
on
two
amorphous
islands
of
in
an
ocean
of
sky
across
which
a
few
fleecy
clouds
sailed
he
had
a
perception
of
the
divine
speaking
through
the
silence
of
beauty
and
the
world
was
asleep
or
at
riot
ah
this
should
have
been
the
message
of
his
art
each
morn
the
sunrise
spoke
its
flaming
word
unheard
it
was
the
function
to
stir
the
world
to
the
perception
of
the
sublimity
and
poetry
that
lay
all
around
unheeded
to
uplift
its
eyes
to
the
loveliness
of
realities
realities
solid
as
rocks
yet
beautiful
as
dreams
visionary
and
tangible
the
great
verities
of
sun
and
sea
and
forest
of
righteousness
and
high
thinking
beautiful
and
elemental
too
late
too
late
art
was
over
now
not
to
his
hand
had
the
mission
been
given
once
he
had
thought
to
feel
the
sacred
fire
in
his
bosom
but
he
knew
now
that
the
mission
was
not
for
him
he
had
failed
the
great
streets
stretched
under
the
blue
dawn
bathed
in
sacred
freshness
the
stir
of
night
was
passing
into
the
stir
of
morning
the
sleepy
yawn
of
returning
revellers
was
met
by
the
sleepy
yawn
of
artisans
two
horrible
hags
of
first
astir
of
parisians
were
resting
their
baskets
on
a
bench
he
heard
them
rapturously
recalling
the
excellence
of
the
soup
they
had
made
from
the
bones
picked
clean
by
dogs
that
they
had
gathered
from
the
ah
not
all
the
world
was
gay
he
had
been
surveying
only
the
sparkling
bubbles
and
froth
of
paris
below
flowed
the
sober
orderly
industrious
civic
life
with
its
bottom
dregs
of
misery
all
the
great
cities
were
full
of
dolorous
figures
every
and
alley
swarmed
with
sickly
faces
pale
fruits
of
a
congested
civilization
he
had
always
kept
his
eye
on
those
happier
than
he
now
he
was
reminded
of
how
much
more
than
the
man
in
the
street
he
had
drawn
in
the
lottery
of
the
fates
he
remembered
the
saying
of
a
street
scavenger
he
had
come
across
in
his
days
of
destitution
neither
hungry
nor
dry
so
what
have
i
to
grumble
about
mate
what
indeed
had
he
matthew
strang
to
grumble
about
there
did
not
seem
to
be
enough
happiness
to
go
round
who
was
he
to
be
selected
for
a
special
helping
who
was
he
more
than
his
mate
the
scavenger
more
than
any
other
of
the
human
souls
he
had
met
in
his
diversified
career
more
than
his
in
the
slums
of
holborn
or
halifax
or
his
on
board
or
the
blind
woman
who
caned
chairs
in
the
basement
of
the
house
of
the
rotherhithe
why
should
he
be
happy
it
was
like
a
new
thought
luminous
and
arrestive
and
then
it
flashed
upon
him
that
all
this
glitter
of
gayety
that
had
dazzled
his
covetous
eyes
even
if
it
were
not
half
an
illusion
was
infinitely
subdivided
each
person
could
only
have
a
minute
share
in
the
overwhelming
total
and
even
this
quantum
of
joy
must
be
alloyed
with
the
inevitable
miseries
of
the
human
lot
this
was
the
fallacy
that
in
london
too
had
added
the
sting
of
envy
to
his
unhappiness
he
had
lumped
together
all
the
pleasure
and
splendor
and
happiness
of
the
capital
forgetting
that
though
it
could
all
be
lacked
by
one
man
it
could
not
be
possessed
by
one
and
to
look
at
life
from
the
outside
was
childish
it
was
like
reading
paragraphs
about
people
in
the
newspapers
how
happy
he
himself
loomed
in
biographical
summaries
poor
rosina
poor
aunt
clara
poor
billy
what
happiness
for
these
they
were
foolish
fretful
creatures
all
of
them
in
the
jargon
of
the
bourgeois
vulgar
impossible
too
low
even
for
the
stigma
of
but
their
lives
were
as
important
to
them
as
his
life
to
him
each
soul
was
the
centre
of
its
own
world
if
he
could
understand
them
and
they
could
not
understand
him
the
gain
was
to
him
he
was
strong
therefore
he
must
supplement
their
weakness
not
because
of
any
ethics
or
theology
simply
because
he
was
stronger
for
sheer
pity
he
must
give
up
his
life
to
theirs
sacrifice
his
art
to
their
happiness
he
must
adapt
himself
to
their
points
of
view
since
they
could
not
adapt
themselves
to
his
if
for
rosina
the
world
turned
on
the
price
of
beef
he
must
teach
himself
to
be
interested
in
the
price
of
beef
he
had
found
it
easy
enough
on
the
day
when
they
had
gone
together
at
halifax
he
saw
her
as
then
buoyant
youthful
gay
even
pretty
was
it
not
he
who
had
made
her
shrewish
sorrowful
unlovely
how
nobly
reticent
she
had
been
about
his
neglect
of
her
coble
had
died
thinking
her
ideally
happy
boastfully
proud
of
his
and
after
all
there
was
an
excellent
side
to
her
economical
instincts
she
did
not
long
for
diamonds
and
like
the
wives
of
other
artists
nay
wiser
perhaps
than
he
she
had
known
how
to
content
herself
with
her
own
station
even
tarmigan
must
have
approved
of
her
as
an
wife
yes
he
must
go
back
to
her
and
his
children
not
out
of
any
deference
to
the
but
as
individual
to
individuals
he
arrived
at
his
hotel
to
his
astonishment
it
was
in
full
illumination
he
heard
the
strains
of
from
within
he
peeped
into
the
magnificent
it
was
become
a
and
sober
couples
were
waltzing
women
always
women
irreproachable
this
time
elegant
in
shimmering
silks
the
world
of
fashion
was
dancing
there
dancing
on
behalf
of
a
charity
he
wavered
again
this
was
the
world
he
was
leaving
forever
the
world
of
soft
things
the
world
of
thought
and
pleasant
speech
the
world
of
art
and
books
and
music
the
caressing
world
that
praised
pictures
and
the
makers
thereof
the
world
of
eleanor
wyndwood
but
the
fight
was
over
in
every
sense
he
told
himself
the
fight
was
over
he
must
go
to
eleanor
and
tell
her
that
happiness
was
not
for
either
she
would
be
strong
and
fine
she
would
strengthen
him
in
his
obedience
to
the
higher
voice
but
oh
and
her
face
swam
up
vivid
again
would
not
the
very
sight
of
her
weaken
him
shatter
his
resolve
and
perhaps
too
the
sight
of
him
would
weaken
even
her
no
they
must
never
meet
again
that
was
the
simplest
the
least
painful
for
both
he
gave
instructions
that
he
was
to
leave
by
the
first
morning
train
he
mounted
to
his
room
and
packed
up
then
he
wrote
to
eleanor
dearest
eleanor
forgive
me
that
i
must
cause
you
pain
i
can
only
hope
it
will
prove
to
have
saved
you
greater
pain
in
the
future
but
my
dear
i
must
not
pretend
it
is
from
any
unselfish
desire
to
save
you
from
sacrificing
yourself
to
my
happiness
as
you
in
your
generous
nobility
have
been
ready
to
do
that
i
have
resolved
never
to
see
you
again
i
am
leaving
paris
at
once
when
i
tell
you
the
reason
i
know
that
it
will
ease
your
pain
and
that
your
noble
nature
will
approve
and
forgive
i
am
going
back
to
my
wife
i
have
thought
it
over
and
see
that
i
have
no
option
i
have
been
forgetting
that
in
return
for
her
helping
me
to
art
i
vowed
to
love
cherish
and
protect
her
if
i
can
not
love
her
if
i
can
only
love
you
if
the
thought
of
you
will
always
be
like
music
to
me
though
i
must
never
see
you
again
in
the
flesh
i
must
at
least
do
my
best
to
make
her
happy
this
is
not
only
a
farewell
to
you
it
is
a
farewell
to
art
without
you
to
inspire
it
my
art
is
dead
i
retire
from
the
long
contest
yours
so
truly
matthew
strang
i
dared
not
trust
myself
to
come
and
tell
you
this
it
would
have
been
a
useless
trial
for
both
of
us
you
will
be
happier
without
me
and
all
the
suffering
my
selfish
passion
must
have
brought
upon
you
forget
me
god
bless
you
he
descended
to
the
and
dropped
the
letter
into
the
box
then
he
sat
outside
on
his
balcony
and
watched
the
great
gleaming
boulevards
as
they
woke
to
the
new
day
he
was
too
early
at
the
station
and
the
train
tarried
the
porters
leisurely
wheeled
in
the
luggage
sleepy
passengers
straggled
up
armed
with
gayly
illustrated
papers
broad
with
gallic
buffoonery
oh
the
agony
of
that
last
quarter
of
an
hour
when
paris
beckoned
him
with
its
finger
of
morning
sunlight
when
art
cried
to
him
from
a
thousand
happy
ateliers
calling
him
to
come
back
and
be
happy
in
the
great
work
he
felt
he
had
been
about
to
do
at
last
when
love
shone
like
a
purple
haze
veiling
the
world
in
poetic
dream
and
sang
to
him
like
an
voice
and
witched
him
back
with
the
eyes
and
the
hair
and
the
lips
of
eleanor
wyndwood
but
the
train
was
going
at
last
and
he
must
take
his
seat
in
his
compartment
it
was
his
second
defeat
his
second
farewell
to
art
bitterer
crueller
by
a
than
the
first
when
he
had
sailed
home
again
penniless
broken
in
soul
and
body
then
at
least
home
was
a
tender
recollection
now
and
he
had
been
so
near
the
goal
of
happiness
the
cup
had
been
at
his
very
lips
never
to
be
happy
never
never
the
sudden
shriek
of
the
engine
sounded
sardonic
the
train
moved
on
bearing
matthew
strang
from
all
the
sweetness
and
savor
of
life
in
the
great
ocean
of
existence
wherein
men
struggle
for
happiness
he
had
gone
down
like
his
father
but
like
his
father
he
had
gone
down
wrapped
in
his
flag
the
stage
of
the
world
is
not
adapted
for
heroic
attitudes
unless
the
curtain
be
dropped
on
the
instant
to
pass
after
a
tedious
journey
from
the
vivid
boulevards
to
the
gray
dreariness
of
a
poor
london
suburb
on
a
sunday
evening
was
already
a
chill
to
the
artistic
mind
to
find
that
the
wife
into
whose
arms
he
had
come
to
fall
in
dramatic
contrition
was
not
only
out
but
gone
to
church
with
aunt
clara
and
little
clara
was
to
be
further
reminded
of
the
essentially
inartistic
character
of
life
in
general
and
of
its
especial
narrowness
in
districts
but
he
stooped
down
to
kiss
little
davie
who
by
reason
of
the
out
had
opened
the
door
and
explained
these
things
to
him
he
saw
that
the
child
had
a
little
wooden
mannikin
in
his
hand
and
was
sucking
it
suck
that
davie
he
said
no
paint
to
spoil
davie
urged
gravely
all
matthew
carried
both
the
little
men
on
his
shoulder
in
the
kitchen
he
found
billy
moping
by
the
fire
profiting
by
the
absence
of
the
servant
to
enjoy
the
only
fire
economy
permitted
at
this
season
of
the
year
but
sunk
so
deep
in
a
black
reverie
that
he
did
not
raise
his
head
at
the
unwonted
footsteps
a
wave
of
protective
love
almost
paternal
flooded
soul
he
laid
his
hand
on
poor
head
as
in
benediction
nevermore
would
they
be
parted
nevermore
he
said
softly
the
young
man
started
violently
and
looked
up
come
back
billy
he
said
tenderly
i
see
replied
billy
ungraciously
he
was
stung
to
the
quick
but
he
controlled
his
pain
he
saw
this
was
part
of
his
atonement
come
to
make
it
up
with
rosina
not
going
away
again
he
went
on
gently
his
hand
on
shoulder
the
use
of
that
billy
snapped
if
she
makes
it
up
with
you
break
out
again
in
a
few
days
i
know
he
set
down
the
child
with
a
sigh
and
drew
a
chair
to
his
side
davie
climbed
trustfully
on
his
knee
the
kettle
was
singing
and
a
plump
gray
cat
purred
in
the
fender
billy
went
on
always
said
you
live
here
it
was
necessary
to
live
at
your
know
but
i
am
giving
up
the
billy
turned
whiter
than
usual
happened
he
cried
in
alarm
in
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
turn
me
out
of
my
workroom
no
billy
i
am
giving
up
painting
eyes
dilated
in
horror
as
on
the
night
when
his
mother
had
dragged
him
out
of
bed
to
trudge
the
frozen
fields
you
mad
he
gasped
something
of
his
awe
sent
a
shiver
through
his
brother
i
am
said
matthew
he
fell
silent
billy
regarded
him
furtively
the
minutes
dragged
on
matthew
looked
at
his
watch
getting
on
for
seven
eleanor
wyndwood
would
have
been
dressing
for
him
he
saw
her
matchless
loveliness
another
few
minutes
and
his
kisses
would
have
been
on
her
lips
those
lips
that
had
lain
on
his
in
what
was
already
an
enchanted
hazy
dream
rather
than
a
waking
memory
i
mad
he
muttered
again
as
he
sat
waiting
for
rosina
instead
and
then
he
caught
sight
of
the
little
figure
davie
was
sucking
and
began
to
laugh
boisterously
billy
was
terrified
can
have
the
studio
back
if
you
like
he
said
soothingly
the
tones
became
protective
in
their
turn
can
write
anywhere
and
after
all
the
use
of
my
writing
nobody
will
take
what
i
can
write
kisses
interposed
davie
looking
up
proudly
does
he
mean
billy
said
matthew
he
used
to
put
crosses
at
the
end
of
the
letter
when
rosina
wrote
to
poor
old
coble
kisses
to
his
grandfather
you
a
angel
now
said
davie
gravely
that
sucking
billy
responded
sternly
know
you
he
took
it
away
and
davie
set
up
a
howl
till
pacified
by
a
penny
an
image
of
a
preacher
matt
billy
explained
forget
his
name
he
died
last
year
rosina
used
to
go
and
hear
him
she
said
he
gave
her
great
comfort
these
images
are
sold
in
thousands
what
a
ludicrous
thing
popular
religion
is
matthew
laughed
but
there
was
a
tear
for
rosina
in
the
laughter
he
said
suddenly
old
coble
leave
her
any
money
but
a
few
thousand
dollars
was
all
there
was
when
his
estate
was
wound
up
he
have
expected
to
crack
up
for
he
made
no
provision
whatever
for
aunt
rosina
is
keeping
her
i
suppose
does
she
reconcile
that
with
her
economy
he
thought
with
an
added
throb
of
tenderness
the
kettle
sang
on
the
cat
purred
he
had
a
flash
of
hope
he
might
grow
to
love
her
yet
but
he
thought
of
eleanor
wyndwood
and
the
hope
died
they
would
have
been
on
their
way
now
to
their
restaurant
sitting
close
together
driving
through
the
flashing
streets
oh
was
he
not
mad
to
be
here
are
you
doing
all
alone
he
thought
love
my
first
love
and
my
last
you
who
believed
in
me
who
were
ready
to
sacrifice
yourself
to
me
you
go
to
see
ruth
hailey
asked
billy
suddenly
face
vanished
he
put
his
hand
to
his
and
drew
out
the
portrait
with
the
sweet
shy
eyes
he
said
tremulously
she
gave
me
billy
took
the
photograph
and
kissed
it
bless
you
he
said
davie
pricked
up
his
ears
not
in
love
with
her
matthew
asked
lightly
with
a
sudden
apprehension
i
know
better
than
to
be
in
love
with
any
woman
said
billy
sadly
as
he
returned
the
portrait
in
my
stories
can
i
love
and
be
was
she
who
sent
us
that
mysterious
money
said
matthew
and
told
him
the
story
billy
listened
in
surprise
and
emotion
bless
you
ruth
he
said
again
is
that
god
interrupted
davie
the
brothers
looked
at
each
other
embarrassed
mummy
tell
you
said
matthew
at
last
did
tell
me
but
i
he
sat
there
wondering
does
god
sleep
the
sudden
blare
and
boom
of
a
salvationist
procession
saved
reply
the
blatant
clangor
passed
died
they
waited
for
rosina
presently
they
heard
the
returning
church
party
descending
into
the
area
so
as
not
to
soil
the
white
he
had
kissed
her
before
she
was
aware
of
his
presence
as
she
stepped
across
the
kitchen
threshold
in
hand
after
that
her
sullenness
was
only
he
said
he
had
come
to
supper
by
the
time
they
had
sat
down
to
it
a
reconciliation
had
been
patched
up
warned
by
reception
of
his
determination
he
did
not
even
break
it
to
her
yet
thus
tamely
passed
off
the
great
renunciation
scene
the
crisis
of
his
life
like
everything
else
in
his
life
unlike
what
he
had
imagined
beforehand
rosina
did
not
even
understand
what
this
meant
to
him
he
pleaded
that
davie
who
did
not
want
to
go
to
sleep
should
be
allowed
to
stay
up
to
supper
but
this
request
was
not
granted
when
does
god
go
to
sleep
the
persistent
davie
remembered
to
ask
as
she
was
leading
him
from
the
room
never
sleeps
replied
rosina
sternly
and
haled
him
to
bed
matthew
pondered
the
immense
saying
so
glibly
spoken
as
he
waited
for
her
to
return
clara
and
wan
her
head
nodding
queerly
with
excitement
at
the
great
presence
was
laying
the
supper
in
the
warm
kitchen
where
the
servant
would
not
resume
possession
till
ten
little
clara
was
at
her
task
of
bible
reading
billy
drowsed
on
his
chair
exhausted
the
fire
glowed
red
the
cat
was
still
stretched
in
the
warmth
something
in
the
scene
thrilled
him
with
a
sense
of
restful
kinship
with
it
half
sweet
half
sad
a
sense
of
being
more
really
at
home
than
in
delicate
the
old
homely
kitchen
far
away
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
sent
out
subtle
links
binding
his
childhood
to
the
manhood
that
had
come
at
last
this
was
typical
of
the
new
life
which
began
that
night
and
which
on
the
morrow
was
sealed
and
consecrated
by
the
characteristically
message
from
eleanor
are
right
we
have
chosen
the
it
was
a
life
full
of
petty
pricks
and
worries
but
if
it
was
not
so
grandiosely
heroic
as
he
had
intended
neither
was
the
consequence
to
his
art
as
he
had
foreseen
he
has
not
given
up
art
neither
rosina
nor
billy
would
permit
that
folly
and
brief
letter
had
a
postscript
of
inspiring
protest
he
had
meant
to
sacrifice
art
and
happiness
but
only
the
latter
sacrifice
was
accepted
for
unhappiness
drove
him
back
to
his
studio
where
the
hung
now
like
an
inspiration
from
the
glooms
and
trials
of
the
daily
routine
in
this
prosaic
home
with
its
faithful
but
mistress
who
knew
not
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
nor
at
what
cost
he
had
made
her
happy
and
who
would
not
even
agree
to
live
in
some
beautiful
country
spot
which
would
have
softened
life
for
him
from
this
depressing
household
with
its
unsprightly
children
its
cheerless
pensioner
its
querulous
cripple
resenting
the
very
hand
that
fed
him
he
escaped
to
the
little
whitewashed
studio
to
find
in
his
art
oblivion
of
the
burden
of
life
and
now
at
last
his
true
life
work
was
begun
removed
from
the
sapping
cynicism
of
the
club
conscience
from
the
drought
of
disbelief
from
the
miasma
of
fashionable
conversation
from
the
confusing
cackle
of
critics
saved
from
the
intrigue
with
wyndwood
that
would
have
distracted
his
soul
and
imposed
an
extra
need
for
withdrawn
from
the
feverish
rush
of
fashion
and
the
enervating
consumption
of
superfluous
food
and
drink
exempted
from
keeping
up
a
luxurious
position
purchased
by
scamped
soulless
pictures
able
to
work
without
the
whims
of
sitters
or
patrons
without
regard
to
prices
for
income
augmented
by
her
very
considerable
hoardings
and
by
his
balance
supplemented
by
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
his
studio
effects
and
illustration
in
the
scene
thrilled
him
with
a
sense
of
restful
ancient
pictures
the
whole
doubled
by
economic
administration
was
amply
sufficient
for
every
rational
need
matthew
strang
began
at
last
without
underthought
of
anything
but
art
in
this
homely
environment
to
which
his
soul
was
native
to
express
his
own
inmost
individuality
to
produce
faithfully
and
finely
the
work
it
was
in
him
to
do
solitary
silent
sorrowful
strong
not
chattering
about
his
ideas
and
his
aims
indifferent
to
fame
or
the
voice
of
posterity
striving
for
and
rarely
obtaining
it
touching
and
retouching
breaking
the
rules
of
the
schools
in
obedience
to
his
own
genius
he
toiled
on
in
his
humble
studio
seeking
the
highest
with
no
man
and
no
woman
to
inspire
encourage
or
praise
he
had
been
saved
from
love
and
happiness
and
sent
back
into
sympathy
with
all
that
works
and
suffers
and
thus
the
note
that
had
trembled
faintly
and
then
died
out
in
his
work
was
struck
strong
and
sure
at
last
the
note
of
soul
to
his
accurate
science
and
his
genius
for
the
decorative
which
are
two
of
the
factors
of
great
art
was
now
added
the
spiritual
poetry
which
is
the
last
and
rarest
for
he
was
master
of
his
soul
at
last
he
had
absorbed
life
sufficiently
he
had
toiled
and
hungered
he
had
feasted
and
made
merry
he
had
sorrowed
and
endured
he
had
sinned
and
suffered
he
had
known
the
lust
of
life
and
the
pride
of
the
eye
he
had
known
love
the
love
of
the
soul
and
the
love
of
the
senses
he
had
known
the
heartache
of
baffled
ambition
and
the
dust
and
ashes
of
achievement
what
he
had
wanted
he
had
not
got
by
the
time
he
had
got
it
he
had
not
wanted
it
whatever
he
had
set
out
to
do
he
had
not
done
and
whatever
he
had
done
he
had
not
foreseen
and
out
of
all
this
travail
of
the
soul
was
born
his
art
strong
austere
simple
in
the
five
or
six
years
since
he
died
to
the
world
he
has
finished
as
many
big
pictures
and
has
made
studies
for
others
besides
a
host
of
minor
things
he
has
not
exhibited
any
of
the
larger
pictures
in
the
academy
three
have
been
presented
quietly
to
provincial
and
suburban
galleries
where
the
people
comes
only
one
with
some
of
the
smaller
things
has
been
sold
for
money
and
this
but
to
appease
rosina
it
was
one
more
sacrifice
of
his
individuality
to
hers
it
is
true
there
are
expenses
for
models
and
materials
and
he
has
now
two
more
children
but
it
jars
upon
him
to
ask
money
for
work
that
expresses
and
conceals
the
tragic
secrets
of
his
inmost
being
nor
does
he
care
to
have
his
pictures
shut
away
amid
the
other
furniture
of
luxurious
mansions
still
he
has
learned
enough
to
know
that
life
can
not
be
lived
ideally
and
moreover
the
event
has
taught
him
again
the
contrariety
of
life
for
his
eccentricity
leaking
out
slowly
has
enhanced
the
fame
to
which
he
is
indifferent
and
aided
by
a
legend
of
mysterious
saturnine
seclusion
has
raised
his
market
value
to
such
a
point
that
he
need
only
sell
an
occasional
picture
one
dealer
in
particular
is
anxious
to
give
him
his
own
price
for
a
picture
matthew
strang
will
probably
part
with
one
to
him
some
day
but
he
does
not
know
that
the
dealer
is
acting
for
lady
thornton
the
wealthy
and
celebrated
society
leader
and
convert
though
he
knows
and
is
glad
that
eleanor
wyndwood
found
both
happiness
and
spiritual
peace
when
a
few
months
after
her
friend
olive
marriage
to
herbert
strang
that
and
impressionable
lady
was
led
to
the
altar
by
the
handsome
and
brilliant
sir
gilbert
thornton
and
went
over
with
him
to
roman
catholicism
with
the
same
earnestness
with
which
she
had
passed
from
her
native
orthodoxy
to
the
socialism
of
gerard
brode
and
thence
to
the
spirituality
of
dolkovitch
she
had
slid
by
a
natural
transition
from
the
sensuous
art
atmosphere
of
matthew
world
into
the
sensuous
spirituality
of
catholicism
as
soon
as
his
influence
had
been
replaced
by
the
ascendency
of
another
male
mind
he
was
not
asked
to
the
wedding
and
the
invitation
to
reaching
him
in
the
days
when
the
first
darkness
of
isolation
was
upon
him
he
had
left
unanswered
and
just
as
he
has
given
his
art
freely
to
the
world
so
under
the
inspiration
of
memory
he
gives
his
services
freely
at
and
other
humble
as
encourager
of
every
talent
that
aspires
under
discouragement
teaching
it
to
be
itself
and
nothing
else
for
the
artist
gives
to
the
world
and
is
not
asked
for
creating
the
taste
he
satisfies
and
art
is
not
truth
nor
beauty
but
a
revelation
of
beautiful
truth
through
the
individual
vision
it
is
the
reaction
to
the
stimulus
of
his
universe
whether
his
universe
be
our
common
world
seen
for
itself
or
through
antecedent
art
or
a
private
world
of
inward
vision
for
while
the
philosophers
are
quarrelling
about
abstract
truth
the
artist
answers
question
through
his
own
personality
the
beauty
which
matthew
art
reveals
though
he
experiments
in
many
styles
with
unequal
results
is
mainly
tragic
for
others
the
gay
the
flippant
the
bright
let
those
from
whose
temperament
these
things
flow
interpret
the
joyousness
and
buoyancy
and
airy
grace
of
existence
for
others
the
empty
experimentation
in
line
and
color
it
is
all
art
in
the
house
of
art
are
many
mansions
he
has
come
to
the
last
of
the
three
stages
of
so
many
artists
who
pass
from
the
fever
to
do
everything
through
a
period
of
intolerance
for
all
they
can
not
do
into
a
genial
acceptance
of
the
good
in
all
schools
but
unassuming
as
he
has
always
been
he
is
yet
sometimes
shaken
by
righteous
indignation
when
he
sees
tawdry
art
art
that
is
the
response
to
the
stimulus
of
no
universe
but
the
artificial
of
models
and
posings
and
enthroned
and
fêted
at
the
banquet
of
life
and
sometimes
an
unguarded
word
flashes
out
before
his
pupils
but
he
always
repents
of
his
railings
feeling
it
is
his
to
work
not
to
judge
to
do
the
one
simple
thing
that
his
hand
findeth
to
do
one
of
his
pictures
is
of
a
woman
looking
out
to
sea
with
hopeless
eyes
there
is
a
mocking
glory
of
sunset
in
the
sky
this
is
called
pain
of
the
the
title
was
due
to
exclamation
that
night
in
devonshire
the
figure
is
his
come
back
to
him
in
his
own
solitude
the
image
of
her
standing
thus
in
the
asylum
at
halifax
could
not
be
effaced
from
his
soul
it
had
to
find
expression
in
his
art
as
he
worked
at
it
with
the
brutal
aloofness
of
the
artist
studying
lights
and
shadows
values
and
effects
gradations
and
tones
he
wondered
whether
the
artist
were
a
monster
or
a
divinely
appointed
alchemist
sent
to
transmute
the
dross
of
the
pain
to
the
gold
of
art
for
the
pleasure
a
magician
to
cover
up
the
rawness
of
life
as
kindly
nature
covers
up
the
naked
earth
with
grass
or
throws
the
purple
light
of
dream
over
all
that
is
dead
over
the
centuries
that
are
past
or
our
youth
that
is
gone
a
redeemer
whose
beautiful
perception
of
pathos
and
tragedy
robs
the
grave
of
its
victory
and
plucks
death
of
its
sting
so
that
no
man
suffereth
or
travaileth
without
contributing
to
the
raw
stuff
of
life
of
which
art
is
woven
by
the
souls
dowered
with
the
pangs
and
privileges
of
each
man
it
sometimes
seemed
to
him
dimly
had
to
pay
so
much
in
sorrow
and
pain
and
in
return
for
that
he
drew
from
the
common
human
fund
the
comprehension
of
life
and
the
consolation
of
art
new
sympathies
and
new
delights
music
and
books
and
pictures
that
only
lived
through
the
rich
variety
of
human
destinies
mystic
atmospheres
and
minor
scales
meaningless
to
souls
that
had
not
suffered
or
inherited
the
capacity
to
suffer
some
generally
the
stupid
paid
little
in
pain
and
sorrow
and
some
as
in
his
own
case
much
but
so
long
as
the
account
showed
a
balance
to
the
general
good
it
was
not
for
the
soul
that
was
sacrificed
to
complain
it
was
perhaps
even
a
privilege
to
subserve
the
common
good
life
was
so
arranged
that
virtue
could
not
be
sure
of
personal
reward
and
this
uncertainty
was
just
what
made
virtue
possible
under
no
other
scheme
of
things
could
the
soul
enjoy
the
privilege
of
virtue
to
have
suffered
as
he
himself
had
done
by
the
institution
of
marriage
both
as
child
and
husband
to
have
been
a
victim
to
the
general
laws
which
safeguard
human
society
to
have
been
cut
in
two
by
the
flaming
swords
of
the
cherubim
which
turn
every
way
to
keep
the
way
of
the
tree
of
life
all
this
did
not
he
thought
give
him
the
right
to
blaspheme
existence
and
the
artist
at
least
extracted
a
soul
of
good
from
all
things
evil
some
such
reflections
not
clear
but
all
confused
and
blurred
for
he
was
no
philosopher
but
an
artist
whose
profoundest
thought
sprang
always
from
the
concrete
image
before
him
came
to
him
again
when
he
was
working
at
his
famous
picture
persecutors
inspired
by
an
episode
in
life
though
billy
does
not
know
it
is
simply
children
tormenting
an
old
man
the
old
man
is
one
of
the
wrecks
the
children
know
not
what
they
do
but
the
pathos
of
the
picture
is
overwhelming
it
purifies
by
pity
and
terror
this
is
the
profit
to
the
world
of
life
matthew
strang
knows
with
the
same
secret
assurance
that
sent
him
out
to
fight
and
strengthened
him
in
the
long
struggle
that
this
picture
will
live
that
the
gods
have
answered
his
boyish
prayer
for
immortality
but
at
moments
when
billy
is
moping
or
in
pain
or
when
the
artist
foresees
the
gabble
of
magazines
and
about
his
work
the
chatter
of
fashionable
parrots
and
the
analysis
of
his
by
glib
comfortable
critics
he
wonders
whether
the
picture
or
the
immortality
is
worth
the
price
but
stronger
than
those
driven
by
their
to
express
in
artistic
shapes
the
futility
of
life
he
does
not
dwell
eternally
on
the
tears
of
things
and
his
picture
simply
entitled
is
perhaps
his
masterpiece
for
when
he
painted
it
that
sunrise
in
paris
was
still
vivid
to
him
and
the
light
in
ruth
eyes
and
that
fire
of
love
in
eleanor
these
things
were
in
the
eternal
order
too
as
truly
as
the
ugliness
and
the
sordid
realities
the
simplest
human
life
was
packed
with
marvels
of
sensation
and
emotion
haloed
with
dreams
and
divine
illusions
to
have
been
a
child
to
have
sung
and
danced
to
have
eaten
and
played
to
have
seen
woods
and
waters
to
have
grown
to
youth
and
to
manhood
to
have
dreamed
and
aspired
to
have
labored
and
hoped
all
this
happiness
had
been
his
while
he
was
looking
for
happiness
just
as
art
had
been
his
in
nova
scotia
while
he
had
been
struggling
to
get
to
it
in
england
and
so
he
yearns
to
paint
the
poetry
of
the
real
not
with
the
false
romantic
glamour
which
had
witched
his
youth
though
even
his
youth
had
had
a
hankering
after
the
real
just
as
his
maturity
retains
a
love
for
the
mystic
that
gilded
unreality
to
which
his
art
would
have
gravitated
had
he
found
happiness
with
the
sentimental
eleanor
in
her
atmosphere
of
fashion
will
be
replaced
by
the
beauty
that
even
when
mystic
is
based
on
truth
he
needed
no
inspiration
nor
the
stimulus
of
cultured
cliques
alone
he
faces
the
realities
of
life
and
death
without
intervening
veils
of
charming
illusion
no
longer
craving
to
filter
the
honest
sunlight
through
stained
cathedral
windows
or
to
tarnish
the
simplicity
of
the
grave
with
monumental
angels
aspiring
now
to
paint
london
he
wanders
through
the
gray
streets
as
in
his
days
of
hunger
but
now
the
grotesque
figures
no
longer
seem
outside
the
realm
of
serious
art
or
mere
picturesque
arrangements
of
line
and
color
to
his
purged
vision
that
still
lacks
humor
they
touch
the
mysteries
and
the
infinities
passing
and
disappearing
like
ghosts
on
a
planet
of
dream
solitude
has
brought
him
a
sense
of
the
universal
life
from
which
they
flow
and
he
fancies
the
function
of
art
should
be
to
show
the
whole
in
every
part
the
universal
through
the
particular
and
so
he
longs
to
paint
the
beauty
that
lies
unseen
of
grosser
eyes
the
poetry
of
mean
streets
and
figures
to
enrich
and
hallow
life
by
revealing
some
sweep
of
a
great
principle
that
purifies
and
atones
in
old
he
has
painted
the
portrait
of
with
davie
on
her
knee
revealing
the
wistful
imprisoned
maternal
instinct
he
detected
one
day
in
her
sunken
eyes
as
she
fondled
his
little
davie
what
makes
this
presentation
of
ugliness
art
is
not
merely
the
breathing
but
the
beauty
of
his
own
pity
which
the
artist
has
added
to
the
nature
he
copied
with
the
falsely
aristocratic
in
art
or
life
he
has
lost
sympathy
to
him
to
be
honest
and
faithful
is
to
belong
to
the
only
aristocracy
in
the
world
and
the
smallest
sometimes
he
dreams
of
some
great
common
art
for
all
men
like
the
sky
and
the
air
which
should
somehow
soften
life
for
all
and
dreaming
thus
he
somewhat
frets
against
the
many
limitations
of
his
own
art
as
once
in
his
callow
boyhood
when
he
set
out
to
write
that
dime
novel
and
against
its
lapsed
influence
in
modern
life
wishing
rather
he
had
been
a
great
poet
or
a
great
musician
only
music
and
poetry
he
feared
while
toiling
at
the
maid
could
express
and
inspire
modern
life
the
impulse
that
had
raised
the
cathedral
had
been
transformed
into
the
impulse
that
built
the
grand
hotel
fitted
throughout
with
electrical
conveniences
in
the
visible
arts
landscape
and
portraiture
alone
seemed
to
find
response
from
the
modern
mind
the
one
by
its
revelation
of
the
beauty
of
the
world
the
other
by
its
increasing
subtlety
of
psychological
insight
painting
had
begun
with
religion
religion
had
led
to
technique
then
religion
had
drifted
away
from
painting
and
then
technique
had
become
a
religion
but
technique
ought
not
to
be
thought
of
separately
except
by
the
student
to
the
artist
the
spiritual
and
the
material
came
as
one
conception
as
metre
comes
with
the
thought
the
spirit
must
be
brought
back
to
painting
this
modern
accuracy
of
tones
and
forms
was
but
the
channel
for
it
but
it
could
no
longer
be
conveyed
through
the
simple
images
of
a
popular
creed
to
which
all
men
vibrated
there
was
no
such
common
chord
for
the
artist
to
touch
even
this
picture
of
old
might
be
unintelligible
without
its
title
and
risked
denunciation
as
literary
and
the
greatest
picture
could
be
seen
by
but
few
but
repining
is
useless
there
is
only
one
thing
he
can
do
and
he
must
do
it
a
small
thing
in
the
span
of
the
cosmos
and
the
sweep
of
the
ages
but
to
be
done
ere
he
goes
down
to
the
kindred
dust
but
before
death
comes
he
has
doubtless
other
things
to
suffer
all
these
spiritual
agonies
have
seared
the
body
in
which
early
privations
and
sickness
had
already
left
the
seeds
of
premature
infirmity
his
children
are
growing
up
too
bringing
new
fears
and
problems
and
yet
his
life
is
not
all
unhappy
work
is
his
anodyne
and
there
is
an
inner
peace
in
the
daily
pain
because
it
is
the
pain
that
his
soul
has
chosen
in
willing
slavery
to
its
own
yoke
but
life
is
too
long
for
ideals
the
unending
procession
of
the
days
depresses
the
finest
enthusiasm
sometimes
when
the
domestic
horizon
is
dark
or
when
his
body
is
racked
with
pain
he
rebels
against
the
rôle
thrust
upon
him
in
the
workshop
and
against
the
fate
that
mocked
at
his
and
made
of
him
a
voluntary
instrument
for
the
happiness
of
rosina
and
herbert
turning
his
every
action
to
issues
and
then
he
longs
for
the
life
that
he
had
found
so
hollow
the
life
of
gay
talk
and
rustling
dresses
and
wine
and
woman
and
song
and
in
such
moments
as
these
when
the
natural
human
instinct
for
happiness
yearning
sunward
breaks
through
all
the
strata
of
laborious
philosophy
and
experience
he
remembers
that
men
call
him
master
and
then
he
seems
to
hear
the
sardonic
laughter
of
mad
peggy
as
he
asks
himself
what
master
he
has
followed
in
his
sacrifice
or
what
master
working
imperturbably
moulds
human
life
at
his
ironic
inscrutable
will
