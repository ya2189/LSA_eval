while

where
the
blessed
you
know
the
story
of
the
three
wise
men
of
the
east
and
how
they
travelled
from
far
away
to
offer
their
gifts
at
the
in
bethlehem
but
have
you
ever
heard
the
story
of
the
other
wise
man
who
also
saw
the
star
in
its
rising
and
set
out
to
follow
it
yet
did
not
arrive
with
his
brethren
in
the
presence
of
the
young
child
jesus
of
the
great
desire
of
this
fourth
pilgrim
and
how
it
was
denied
yet
accomplished
in
the
denial
of
his
many
wanderings
and
the
probations
of
his
soul
of
the
long
way
of
his
seeking
and
the
strange
way
of
his
finding
the
one
whom
he
sought
i
would
tell
the
tale
as
i
have
heard
fragments
of
it
in
the
hall
of
dreams
in
the
palace
of
the
heart
of
man
the
sign
in
the
sky
in
the
days
when
augustus
caesar
was
master
of
many
kings
and
herod
reigned
in
jerusalem
there
lived
in
the
city
of
ecbatana
among
the
mountains
of
persia
a
certain
man
named
artaban
the
median
his
house
stood
close
to
the
outermost
of
the
seven
walls
which
encircled
the
royal
treasury
from
his
roof
he
could
look
over
the
rising
battlements
of
black
and
white
and
crimson
and
blue
and
red
and
silver
and
gold
to
the
hill
where
the
summer
palace
of
the
parthian
emperors
glittered
like
a
jewel
in
a
sevenfold
crown
around
the
dwelling
of
artaban
spread
a
fair
garden
a
tangle
of
flowers
and
watered
by
a
score
of
streams
descending
from
the
slopes
of
mount
orontes
and
made
musical
by
innumerable
birds
but
all
colour
was
lost
in
the
soft
and
odorous
darkness
of
the
late
september
night
and
all
sounds
were
hushed
in
the
deep
charm
of
its
silence
save
the
plashing
of
the
water
like
a
voice
half
sobbing
and
half
laughing
under
the
shadows
high
above
the
trees
a
dim
glow
of
light
shone
through
the
curtained
arches
of
the
upper
chamber
where
the
master
of
the
house
was
holding
council
with
his
friends
he
stood
by
the
doorway
to
greet
his
guests
a
tall
dark
man
of
about
forty
years
with
brilliant
eyes
set
near
together
under
his
broad
brow
and
firm
lines
graven
around
his
fine
thin
lips
the
brow
of
a
dreamer
and
the
mouth
of
a
soldier
a
man
of
sensitive
feeling
but
inflexible
will
one
of
those
who
in
whatever
age
they
may
live
are
born
for
inward
conflict
and
a
life
of
quest
his
robe
was
of
pure
white
wool
thrown
over
a
tunic
of
silk
and
a
white
pointed
cap
with
long
lapels
at
the
sides
rested
on
his
flowing
black
hair
it
was
the
dress
of
the
ancient
priesthood
of
the
magi
called
the
welcome
he
said
in
his
low
pleasant
voice
as
one
after
another
entered
the
room
welcome
abdus
peace
be
with
you
rhodaspes
and
tigranes
and
with
you
my
father
abgarus
you
are
all
welcome
and
this
house
grows
bright
with
the
joy
of
your
presence
there
were
nine
of
the
men
differing
widely
in
age
but
alike
in
the
richness
of
their
dress
of
silks
and
in
the
massive
golden
collars
around
their
necks
marking
them
as
parthian
nobles
and
in
the
winged
circles
of
gold
resting
upon
their
breasts
the
sign
of
the
followers
of
zoroaster
they
took
their
places
around
a
small
black
altar
at
the
end
of
the
room
where
a
tiny
flame
was
burning
artaban
standing
beside
it
and
waving
a
barsom
of
thin
tamarisk
branches
above
the
fire
fed
it
with
dry
sticks
of
pine
and
fragrant
oils
then
he
began
the
ancient
chant
of
the
yasna
and
the
voices
of
his
companions
joined
in
the
beautiful
hymn
to
we
worship
the
spirit
divine
all
wisdom
and
goodness
possessing
surrounded
by
holy
immortals
the
givers
of
bounty
and
blessing
we
joy
in
the
works
of
his
hands
his
truth
and
his
power
confessing
we
praise
all
the
things
that
are
pure
for
these
are
his
only
creation
the
thoughts
that
are
true
and
the
words
and
deeds
that
have
won
approbation
these
are
supported
by
him
and
for
these
we
make
adoration
hear
us
o
mazda
thou
livest
in
truth
and
in
heavenly
gladness
cleanse
us
from
falsehood
and
keep
us
from
evil
and
bondage
to
badness
pour
out
the
light
and
the
joy
of
thy
life
on
our
darkness
and
sadness
shine
on
our
gardens
and
fields
shine
on
our
working
and
weaving
shine
on
the
whole
race
of
man
believing
and
unbelieving
shine
on
us
now
through
the
night
shine
on
us
now
in
thy
might
the
flame
of
our
holy
love
and
the
song
of
our
worship
receiving
the
fire
rose
with
the
chant
throbbing
as
if
it
were
made
of
musical
flame
until
it
cast
a
bright
illumination
through
the
whole
apartment
revealing
its
simplicity
and
splendour
the
floor
was
laid
with
tiles
of
dark
blue
veined
with
white
pilasters
of
twisted
silver
stood
out
against
the
blue
walls
the
clearstory
of
windows
above
them
was
hung
with
azure
silk
the
vaulted
ceiling
was
a
pavement
of
sapphires
like
the
body
of
heaven
in
its
clearness
sown
with
silver
stars
from
the
four
corners
of
the
roof
hung
four
golden
called
the
tongues
of
the
gods
at
the
eastern
end
behind
the
altar
there
were
two
pillars
of
porphyry
above
them
a
lintel
of
the
same
stone
on
which
was
carved
the
figure
of
a
winged
archer
with
his
arrow
set
to
the
string
and
his
bow
drawn
the
doorway
between
the
pillars
which
opened
upon
the
terrace
of
the
roof
was
covered
with
a
heavy
curtain
of
the
colour
of
a
ripe
pomegranate
embroidered
with
innumerable
golden
rays
shooting
upward
from
the
floor
in
effect
the
room
was
like
a
quiet
starry
night
all
azure
and
silver
flushed
in
the
east
with
rosy
promise
of
the
dawn
it
was
as
the
house
of
a
man
should
be
an
expression
of
the
character
and
spirit
of
the
master
he
turned
to
his
friends
when
the
song
was
ended
and
invited
them
to
be
seated
on
the
divan
at
the
western
end
of
the
room
you
have
come
said
he
looking
around
the
circle
at
my
call
as
the
faithful
scholars
of
zoroaster
to
renew
your
worship
and
rekindle
your
faith
in
the
god
of
purity
even
as
this
fire
has
been
rekindled
on
the
altar
we
worship
not
the
fire
but
him
of
whom
it
is
the
chosen
symbol
because
it
is
the
purest
of
all
created
things
it
speaks
to
us
of
one
who
is
light
and
truth
is
it
not
so
my
father
it
is
well
said
my
son
answered
the
venerable
abgarus
the
enlightened
are
never
idolaters
they
lift
the
veil
of
the
form
and
go
in
to
the
shrine
of
the
reality
and
new
light
and
truth
are
coming
to
them
continually
through
the
old
symbols
hear
me
then
my
father
and
my
friends
said
artaban
very
quietly
while
i
tell
you
of
the
new
light
and
truth
that
have
come
to
me
through
the
most
ancient
of
all
signs
we
have
searched
the
secrets
of
nature
together
and
studied
the
healing
virtues
of
water
and
fire
and
the
plants
we
have
read
also
the
books
of
prophecy
in
which
the
future
is
dimly
foretold
in
words
that
are
hard
to
understand
but
the
highest
of
all
learning
is
the
knowledge
of
the
stars
to
trace
their
courses
is
to
untangle
the
threads
of
the
mystery
of
life
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
if
we
could
follow
them
perfectly
nothing
would
be
hidden
from
us
but
is
not
our
knowledge
of
them
still
incomplete
are
there
not
many
stars
still
beyond
our
horizon
lights
that
are
known
only
to
the
dwellers
in
the
far
among
the
of
punt
and
the
gold
mines
of
ophir
there
was
a
murmur
of
assent
among
the
listeners
the
stars
said
tigranes
are
the
thoughts
of
the
eternal
they
are
numberless
but
the
thoughts
of
man
can
be
counted
like
the
years
of
his
life
the
wisdom
of
the
magi
is
the
greatest
of
all
wisdoms
on
earth
because
it
knows
its
own
ignorance
and
that
is
the
secret
of
power
we
keep
men
always
looking
and
waiting
for
a
new
sunrise
but
we
ourselves
know
that
the
darkness
is
equal
to
the
light
and
that
the
conflict
between
them
will
never
be
ended
that
does
not
satisfy
me
answered
artaban
for
if
the
waiting
must
be
endless
if
there
could
be
no
fulfilment
of
it
then
it
would
not
be
wisdom
to
look
and
wait
we
should
become
like
those
new
teachers
of
the
greeks
who
say
that
there
is
no
truth
and
that
the
only
wise
men
are
those
who
spend
their
lives
in
discovering
and
exposing
the
lies
that
have
been
believed
in
the
world
but
the
new
sunrise
will
certainly
dawn
in
the
appointed
time
do
not
our
own
books
tell
us
that
this
will
come
to
pass
and
that
men
will
see
the
brightness
of
a
great
light
that
is
true
said
the
voice
of
abgarus
every
faithful
disciple
of
zoroaster
knows
the
prophecy
of
the
avesta
and
carries
the
word
in
his
heart
that
day
sosiosh
the
victorious
shall
arise
out
of
the
number
of
the
prophets
in
the
east
country
around
him
shall
shine
a
mighty
brightness
and
he
shall
make
life
everlasting
incorruptible
and
immortal
and
the
dead
shall
rise
again
this
is
a
dark
saying
said
tigranes
and
it
may
be
that
we
shall
never
understand
it
it
is
better
to
consider
the
things
that
are
near
at
hand
and
to
increase
the
influence
of
the
magi
in
their
own
country
rather
than
to
look
for
one
who
may
be
a
stranger
and
to
whom
we
must
resign
our
power
the
others
seemed
to
approve
these
words
there
was
a
silent
feeling
of
agreement
manifest
among
them
their
looks
responded
with
that
indefinable
expression
which
always
follows
when
a
speaker
has
uttered
the
thought
that
has
been
slumbering
in
the
hearts
of
his
listeners
but
artaban
turned
to
abgarus
with
a
glow
on
his
face
and
said
my
father
i
have
kept
this
prophecy
in
the
secret
place
of
my
soul
religion
without
a
great
hope
would
be
like
an
altar
without
a
living
fire
and
now
the
flame
has
burned
more
brightly
and
by
the
light
of
it
i
have
read
other
words
which
also
have
come
from
the
fountain
of
truth
and
speak
yet
more
clearly
of
the
rising
of
the
victorious
one
in
his
brightness
he
drew
from
the
breast
of
his
tunic
two
small
rolls
of
fine
linen
with
writing
upon
them
and
unfolded
them
carefully
upon
his
knee
in
the
years
that
are
lost
in
the
past
long
before
our
fathers
came
into
the
land
of
babylon
there
were
wise
men
in
chaldea
from
whom
the
first
of
the
magi
learned
the
secret
of
the
heavens
and
of
these
balaam
the
son
of
beor
was
one
of
the
mightiest
hear
the
words
of
his
prophecy
shall
come
a
star
out
of
jacob
and
a
sceptre
shall
arise
out
of
israel
the
lips
of
tigranes
drew
downward
with
contempt
as
he
said
judah
was
a
captive
by
the
waters
of
babylon
and
the
sons
of
jacob
were
in
bondage
to
our
kings
the
tribes
of
israel
are
scattered
through
the
mountains
like
lost
sheep
and
from
the
remnant
that
dwells
in
judea
under
the
yoke
of
rome
neither
star
nor
sceptre
shall
arise
and
yet
answered
artaban
it
was
the
hebrew
daniel
the
mighty
searcher
of
dreams
the
counsellor
of
kings
the
wise
belteshazzar
who
was
most
honored
and
beloved
of
our
great
king
cyrus
a
prophet
of
sure
things
and
a
reader
of
the
thoughts
of
god
daniel
proved
himself
to
our
people
and
these
are
the
words
that
he
wrote
artaban
read
from
the
second
roll
therefore
and
understand
that
from
the
going
forth
of
the
commandment
to
restore
jerusalem
unto
the
anointed
one
the
prince
the
time
shall
be
seven
and
threescore
and
two
weeks
but
my
son
said
abgarus
doubtfully
these
are
mystical
numbers
who
can
interpret
them
or
who
can
find
the
key
that
shall
unlock
their
meaning
artaban
answered
it
has
been
shown
to
me
and
to
my
three
companions
among
the
magi
caspar
melchior
and
balthazar
we
have
searched
the
ancient
tablets
of
chaldea
and
computed
the
time
it
falls
in
this
year
we
have
studied
the
sky
and
in
the
spring
of
the
year
we
saw
two
of
the
greatest
stars
draw
near
together
in
the
sign
of
the
fish
which
is
the
house
of
the
hebrews
we
also
saw
a
new
star
there
which
shone
for
one
night
and
then
vanished
now
again
the
two
great
planets
are
meeting
this
night
is
their
conjunction
my
three
brothers
are
watching
at
the
ancient
temple
of
the
seven
spheres
at
borsippa
in
babylonia
and
i
am
watching
here
if
the
star
shines
again
they
will
wait
ten
days
for
me
at
the
temple
and
then
we
will
set
out
together
for
jerusalem
to
see
and
worship
the
promised
one
who
shall
be
born
king
of
israel
i
believe
the
sign
will
come
i
have
made
ready
for
the
journey
i
have
sold
my
house
and
my
possessions
and
bought
these
three
jewels
a
sapphire
a
ruby
and
a
pearl
to
carry
them
as
tribute
to
the
king
and
i
ask
you
to
go
with
me
on
the
pilgrimage
that
we
may
have
joy
together
in
finding
the
prince
who
is
worthy
to
be
served
while
he
was
speaking
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
inmost
fold
of
his
girdle
and
drew
out
three
great
gems
one
blue
as
a
fragment
of
the
night
sky
one
redder
than
a
ray
of
sunrise
and
one
as
pure
as
the
peak
of
a
snow
mountain
at
twilight
and
laid
them
on
the
outspread
linen
scrolls
before
him
but
his
friends
looked
on
with
strange
and
alien
eyes
a
veil
of
doubt
and
mistrust
came
over
their
faces
like
a
fog
creeping
up
from
the
marshes
to
hide
the
hills
they
glanced
at
each
other
with
looks
of
wonder
and
pity
as
those
who
have
listened
to
incredible
sayings
the
story
of
a
wild
vision
or
the
proposal
of
an
impossible
enterprise
at
last
tigranes
said
artaban
this
is
a
vain
dream
it
comes
from
too
much
looking
upon
the
stars
and
the
cherishing
of
lofty
thoughts
it
would
be
wiser
to
spend
the
time
in
gathering
money
for
the
new
at
chala
no
king
will
ever
rise
from
the
broken
race
of
israel
and
no
end
will
ever
come
to
the
eternal
strife
of
light
and
darkness
he
who
looks
for
it
is
a
chaser
of
shadows
farewell
and
another
said
artaban
i
have
no
knowledge
of
these
things
and
my
office
as
guardian
of
the
royal
treasure
binds
me
here
the
quest
is
not
for
me
but
if
thou
must
follow
it
fare
thee
well
and
another
said
in
my
house
there
sleeps
a
new
bride
and
i
can
not
leave
her
nor
take
her
with
me
on
this
strange
journey
this
quest
is
not
for
me
but
may
thy
steps
be
prospered
wherever
thou
goest
so
farewell
and
another
said
i
am
ill
and
unfit
for
hardship
but
there
is
a
man
among
my
servants
whom
i
will
send
with
thee
when
thou
goest
to
bring
me
word
how
thou
farest
but
abgarus
the
oldest
and
the
one
who
loved
artaban
the
best
lingered
after
the
others
had
gone
and
said
gravely
my
son
it
may
be
that
the
light
of
truth
is
in
this
sign
that
has
appeared
in
the
skies
and
then
it
will
surely
lead
to
the
prince
and
the
mighty
brightness
or
it
may
be
that
it
is
only
a
shadow
of
the
light
as
tigranes
has
said
and
then
he
who
follows
it
will
have
only
a
long
pilgrimage
and
an
empty
search
but
it
is
better
to
follow
even
the
shadow
of
the
best
than
to
remain
content
with
the
worst
and
those
who
would
see
wonderful
things
must
often
be
ready
to
travel
alone
i
am
too
old
for
this
journey
but
my
heart
shall
be
a
companion
of
the
pilgrimage
day
and
night
and
i
shall
know
the
end
of
thy
quest
go
in
peace
so
one
by
one
they
went
out
of
the
azure
chamber
with
its
silver
stars
and
artaban
was
left
in
solitude
he
gathered
up
the
jewels
and
replaced
them
in
his
girdle
for
a
long
time
he
stood
and
watched
the
flame
that
flickered
and
sank
upon
the
altar
then
he
crossed
the
hall
lifted
the
heavy
curtain
and
passed
out
between
the
dull
red
pillars
of
porphyry
to
the
terrace
on
the
roof
the
shiver
that
thrills
through
the
earth
ere
she
rouses
from
her
night
sleep
had
already
begun
and
the
cool
wind
that
heralds
the
daybreak
was
drawing
downward
from
the
lofty
ravines
of
mount
orontes
birds
half
awakened
crept
and
chirped
among
the
rustling
leaves
and
the
smell
of
ripened
grapes
came
in
brief
wafts
from
the
arbours
far
over
the
eastern
plain
a
white
mist
stretched
like
a
lake
but
where
the
distant
peak
of
zagros
serrated
the
western
horizon
the
sky
was
clear
jupiter
and
saturn
rolled
together
like
drops
of
lambent
flame
about
to
blend
in
one
as
artaban
watched
them
behold
an
azure
spark
was
born
out
of
the
darkness
beneath
rounding
itself
with
purple
splendours
to
a
crimson
sphere
and
spiring
upward
through
rays
of
saffron
and
orange
into
a
point
of
white
radiance
tiny
and
infinitely
remote
yet
perfect
in
every
part
it
pulsated
in
the
enormous
vault
as
if
the
three
jewels
in
the
magian
breast
had
mingled
and
been
transformed
into
a
living
heart
of
light
he
bowed
his
head
he
covered
his
brow
with
his
hands
it
is
the
sign
he
said
the
king
is
coming
and
i
will
go
to
meet
him
by
the
waters
of
babylon
all
night
long
vasda
the
swiftest
of
artaban
horses
had
been
waiting
saddled
and
bridled
in
her
stall
pawing
the
ground
impatiently
and
shaking
her
bit
as
if
she
shared
the
eagerness
of
her
master
purpose
though
she
knew
not
its
meaning
before
the
birds
had
fully
roused
to
their
strong
high
joyful
chant
of
morning
song
before
the
white
mist
had
begun
to
lift
lazily
from
the
plain
the
other
wise
man
was
in
the
saddle
riding
swiftly
along
the
which
skirted
the
base
of
mount
orontes
westward
how
close
how
intimate
is
the
comradeship
between
a
man
and
his
favourite
horse
on
a
long
journey
it
is
a
silent
comprehensive
friendship
an
intercourse
beyond
the
need
of
words
they
drink
at
the
same
springs
and
sleep
under
the
same
guardian
stars
they
are
conscious
together
of
the
subduing
spell
of
nightfall
and
the
quickening
joy
of
daybreak
the
master
shares
his
evening
meal
with
his
hungry
companion
and
feels
the
soft
moist
lips
caressing
the
palm
of
his
hand
as
they
close
over
the
morsel
of
bread
in
the
gray
dawn
he
is
roused
from
his
bivouac
by
the
gentle
stir
of
a
warm
sweet
breath
over
his
sleeping
face
and
looks
up
into
the
eyes
of
his
faithful
ready
and
waiting
for
the
toil
of
the
day
surely
unless
he
is
a
pagan
and
an
unbeliever
by
whatever
name
he
calls
upon
his
god
he
will
thank
him
for
this
voiceless
sympathy
this
dumb
affection
and
his
morning
prayer
will
embrace
a
double
blessing
god
bless
us
both
and
keep
our
feet
from
falling
and
our
souls
from
death
and
then
through
the
keen
morning
air
the
swift
hoofs
beat
their
spirited
music
along
the
road
keeping
time
to
the
pulsing
of
two
hearts
that
are
moved
with
the
same
eager
desire
to
conquer
space
to
devour
the
distance
to
attain
the
goal
of
the
journey
artaban
must
indeed
ride
wisely
and
well
if
he
would
keep
the
appointed
hour
with
the
other
magi
for
the
route
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
parasangs
and
fifteen
was
the
utmost
that
he
could
travel
in
a
day
but
he
knew
vasda
strength
and
pushed
forward
without
anxiety
making
the
fixed
distance
every
day
though
he
must
travel
late
into
the
night
and
in
the
morning
long
before
sunrise
he
passed
along
the
brown
slopes
of
mt
orontes
furrowed
by
the
rocky
courses
of
a
hundred
torrents
he
crossed
the
level
plains
of
the
nisaeans
where
the
famous
herds
of
horses
feeding
in
the
wide
pastures
tossed
their
heads
at
approach
and
galloped
away
with
a
thunder
of
many
hoofs
and
flocks
of
wild
birds
rose
suddenly
from
the
swampy
meadows
wheeling
in
great
circles
with
a
shining
flutter
of
innumerable
wings
and
shrill
cries
of
surprise
he
traversed
the
fertile
fields
of
concabar
where
the
dust
from
the
filled
the
air
with
a
golden
mist
half
hiding
the
huge
temple
of
astarte
with
its
four
hundred
pillars
at
baghistan
among
the
rich
gardens
watered
by
fountains
from
the
rock
he
looked
up
at
the
mountain
thrusting
its
immense
rugged
brow
out
over
the
road
and
saw
the
figure
of
king
darius
trampling
upon
his
fallen
foes
and
the
proud
list
of
his
wars
and
conquests
graven
high
upon
the
face
of
the
eternal
cliff
over
many
a
cold
and
desolate
pass
crawling
painfully
across
the
shoulders
of
the
hills
down
many
a
black
where
the
river
roared
and
raced
before
him
like
a
savage
guide
across
many
a
smiling
vale
with
terraces
of
yellow
limestone
full
of
vines
and
through
the
of
carine
and
the
dark
gates
of
zagros
walled
in
by
precipices
into
the
ancient
city
of
chala
where
the
people
of
samaria
had
been
kept
in
captivity
long
ago
and
out
again
by
the
mighty
portal
riven
through
the
encircling
hills
where
he
saw
the
image
of
the
high
priest
of
the
magi
sculptured
on
the
wall
of
rock
with
hand
uplifted
as
if
to
bless
the
centuries
of
pilgrims
past
the
entrance
of
the
narrow
defile
filled
from
end
to
end
with
orchards
of
peaches
and
figs
through
which
the
river
gyndes
foamed
down
to
meet
him
over
the
broad
where
the
autumnal
vapours
spread
their
deathly
mists
following
along
the
course
of
the
river
under
tremulous
shadows
of
poplar
and
tamarind
among
the
lower
hills
and
out
upon
the
flat
plain
where
the
road
ran
straight
as
an
arrow
through
the
and
parched
meadows
past
the
city
of
ctesiphon
where
the
parthian
emperors
reigned
and
the
vast
metropolis
of
seleucia
which
alexander
built
across
the
swirling
floods
of
tigris
and
the
many
channels
of
euphrates
flowing
yellow
through
the
artaban
pressed
onward
until
he
arrived
at
nightfall
of
the
tenth
day
beneath
the
shattered
walls
of
populous
babylon
vasda
was
almost
spent
and
he
would
gladly
have
turned
into
the
city
to
find
rest
and
refreshment
for
himself
and
for
her
but
he
knew
that
it
was
three
hours
journey
yet
to
the
temple
of
the
seven
spheres
and
he
must
reach
the
place
by
midnight
if
he
would
find
his
comrades
waiting
so
he
did
not
halt
but
rode
steadily
across
the
a
grove
of
made
an
island
of
gloom
in
the
pale
yellow
sea
as
she
passed
into
the
shadow
vasda
slackened
her
pace
and
began
to
pick
her
way
more
carefully
near
the
farther
end
of
the
darkness
an
access
of
caution
seemed
to
fall
upon
her
she
scented
some
danger
or
difficulty
it
was
not
in
her
heart
to
fly
from
it
only
to
be
prepared
for
it
and
to
meet
it
wisely
as
a
good
horse
should
do
the
grove
was
close
and
silent
as
the
tomb
not
a
leaf
rustled
not
a
bird
sang
she
felt
her
steps
before
her
delicately
carrying
her
head
low
and
sighing
now
and
then
with
apprehension
at
last
she
gave
a
quick
breath
of
anxiety
and
dismay
and
stood
quivering
in
every
muscle
before
a
dark
object
in
the
shadow
of
the
last
artaban
dismounted
the
dim
starlight
revealed
the
form
of
a
man
lying
across
the
road
his
humble
dress
and
the
outline
of
his
haggard
face
showed
that
he
was
probably
one
of
the
poor
hebrew
exiles
who
still
dwelt
in
great
numbers
in
the
vicinity
his
pallid
skin
dry
and
yellow
as
parchment
bore
the
mark
of
the
deadly
fever
which
ravaged
the
in
autumn
the
chill
of
death
was
in
his
lean
hand
and
as
artaban
released
it
the
arm
fell
back
inertly
upon
the
motionless
breast
he
turned
away
with
a
thought
of
pity
consigning
the
body
to
that
strange
burial
which
the
magians
deem
most
fitting
the
funeral
of
the
desert
from
which
the
kites
and
vultures
rise
on
dark
wings
and
the
beasts
of
prey
slink
furtively
away
leaving
only
a
heap
of
white
bones
in
the
sand
but
as
he
turned
a
long
faint
ghostly
sigh
came
from
the
man
lips
the
brown
bony
fingers
closed
convulsively
on
the
hem
of
the
robe
and
held
him
fast
artaban
heart
leaped
to
his
throat
not
with
fear
but
with
a
dumb
resentment
at
the
importunity
of
this
blind
delay
how
could
he
stay
here
in
the
darkness
to
minister
to
a
dying
stranger
what
claim
had
this
unknown
fragment
of
human
life
upon
his
compassion
or
his
service
if
he
lingered
but
for
an
hour
he
could
hardly
reach
borsippa
at
the
appointed
time
his
companions
would
think
he
had
given
up
the
journey
they
would
go
without
him
he
would
lose
his
quest
but
if
he
went
on
now
the
man
would
surely
die
if
he
stayed
life
might
be
restored
his
spirit
throbbed
and
fluttered
with
the
urgency
of
the
crisis
should
he
risk
the
great
reward
of
his
divine
faith
for
the
sake
of
a
single
deed
of
human
love
should
he
turn
aside
if
only
for
a
moment
from
the
following
of
the
star
to
give
a
cup
of
cold
water
to
a
poor
perishing
hebrew
god
of
truth
and
purity
he
prayed
direct
me
in
the
holy
path
the
way
of
wisdom
which
thou
only
knowest
then
he
turned
back
to
the
sick
man
loosening
the
grasp
of
his
hand
he
carried
him
to
a
little
mound
at
the
foot
of
the
he
unbound
the
thick
folds
of
the
turban
and
opened
the
garment
above
the
sunken
breast
he
brought
water
from
one
of
the
small
canals
near
by
and
moistened
the
sufferer
brow
and
mouth
he
mingled
a
draught
of
one
of
those
simple
but
potent
remedies
which
he
carried
always
in
his
girdle
for
the
magians
were
physicians
as
well
as
astrologers
and
poured
it
slowly
between
the
colourless
lips
hour
after
hour
he
labored
as
only
a
skilful
healer
of
disease
can
do
and
at
last
the
strength
returned
he
sat
up
and
looked
about
him
who
art
thou
he
said
in
the
rude
dialect
of
the
country
and
why
hast
thou
sought
me
here
to
bring
back
my
life
i
am
artaban
the
magian
of
the
city
of
ecbatana
and
i
am
going
to
jerusalem
in
search
of
one
who
is
to
be
born
king
of
the
jews
a
great
prince
and
deliverer
for
all
men
i
dare
not
delay
any
longer
upon
my
journey
for
the
caravan
that
has
waited
for
me
may
depart
without
me
but
see
here
is
all
that
i
have
left
of
bread
and
wine
and
here
is
a
potion
of
healing
herbs
when
thy
strength
is
restored
thou
find
the
dwellings
of
the
hebrews
among
the
houses
of
babylon
the
jew
raised
his
trembling
hands
solemnly
to
heaven
now
may
the
god
of
abraham
and
isaac
and
jacob
bless
and
prosper
the
journey
of
the
merciful
and
bring
him
in
peace
to
his
desired
haven
but
stay
i
have
nothing
to
give
thee
in
return
only
this
that
i
can
tell
thee
where
the
messiah
must
be
sought
for
our
prophets
have
said
that
he
should
be
born
not
in
jerusalem
but
in
bethlehem
of
judah
may
the
lord
bring
thee
in
safety
to
that
place
because
thou
hast
had
pity
upon
the
sick
it
was
already
long
past
midnight
artaban
rode
in
haste
and
vasda
restored
by
the
brief
rest
ran
eagerly
through
the
silent
plain
and
swam
the
channels
of
the
river
she
put
forth
the
remnant
of
her
strength
and
fled
over
the
ground
like
a
gazelle
illustration
he
caught
it
up
and
read
but
the
first
beam
of
the
sun
sent
her
shadow
before
her
as
she
entered
upon
the
final
stadium
of
the
journey
and
the
eyes
of
artaban
anxiously
scanning
the
great
mound
of
nimrod
and
the
temple
of
the
seven
spheres
could
discern
no
trace
of
his
friends
the
terraces
of
black
and
orange
and
red
and
yellow
and
green
and
blue
and
white
shattered
by
the
convulsions
of
nature
and
crumbling
under
the
repeated
blows
of
human
violence
still
glittered
like
a
ruined
rainbow
in
the
morning
light
artaban
rode
swiftly
around
the
hill
he
dismounted
and
climbed
to
the
highest
terrace
looking
out
towards
the
west
the
huge
desolation
of
the
marshes
stretched
away
to
the
horizon
and
the
border
of
the
desert
bitterns
stood
by
the
stagnant
pools
and
jackals
skulked
through
the
low
bushes
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
caravan
of
the
wise
men
far
or
near
at
the
edge
of
the
terrace
he
saw
a
little
cairn
of
broken
bricks
and
under
them
a
piece
of
parchment
he
caught
it
up
and
read
we
have
waited
past
the
midnight
and
can
delay
no
longer
we
go
to
find
the
king
follow
us
across
the
desert
artaban
sat
down
upon
the
ground
and
covered
his
head
in
despair
how
can
i
cross
the
desert
said
he
with
no
food
and
with
a
spent
horse
i
must
return
to
babylon
sell
my
sapphire
and
buy
a
train
of
camels
and
provision
for
the
journey
i
may
never
overtake
my
friends
only
god
the
merciful
knows
whether
i
shall
not
lose
the
sight
of
the
king
because
i
tarried
to
show
mercy
for
the
sake
of
a
little
child
there
was
a
silence
in
the
hall
of
dreams
where
i
was
listening
to
the
story
of
the
other
wise
man
and
through
this
silence
i
saw
but
very
dimly
his
figure
passing
over
the
dreary
undulations
of
the
desert
high
upon
the
back
of
his
camel
rocking
steadily
onward
like
a
ship
over
the
waves
the
land
of
death
spread
its
cruel
net
around
him
the
stony
wastes
bore
no
fruit
but
briers
and
thorns
the
dark
ledges
of
rock
thrust
themselves
above
the
surface
here
and
there
like
the
bones
of
perished
monsters
arid
and
inhospitable
mountain
ranges
rose
before
him
furrowed
with
dry
channels
of
ancient
torrents
white
and
ghastly
as
scars
on
the
face
of
nature
shifting
hills
of
treacherous
sand
were
heaped
like
tombs
along
the
horizon
by
day
the
fierce
heat
pressed
its
intolerable
burden
on
the
quivering
air
and
no
living
creature
moved
on
the
dumb
swooning
earth
but
tiny
jerboas
scuttling
through
the
parched
bushes
or
lizards
vanishing
in
the
clefts
of
the
rock
by
night
the
jackals
prowled
and
barked
in
the
distance
and
the
lion
made
the
black
ravines
echo
with
his
hollow
roaring
while
a
bitter
blighting
chill
followed
the
fever
of
the
day
through
heat
and
cold
the
magian
moved
steadily
onward
then
i
saw
the
gardens
and
orchards
of
damascus
watered
by
the
streams
of
abana
and
pharpar
with
their
sloping
swards
inlaid
with
bloom
and
their
thickets
of
myrrh
and
roses
i
saw
also
the
long
snowy
ridge
of
hermon
and
the
dark
groves
of
cedars
and
the
valley
of
the
jordan
and
the
blue
waters
of
the
lake
of
galilee
and
the
fertile
plain
of
esdraelon
and
the
hills
of
ephraim
and
the
highlands
of
judah
through
all
these
i
followed
the
figure
of
artaban
moving
steadily
onward
until
he
arrived
at
bethlehem
and
it
was
the
third
day
after
the
three
wise
men
had
come
to
that
place
and
had
found
mary
and
joseph
with
the
young
child
jesus
and
had
laid
their
gifts
of
gold
and
frankincense
and
myrrh
at
his
feet
then
the
other
wise
man
drew
near
weary
but
full
of
hope
bearing
his
ruby
and
his
pearl
to
offer
to
the
king
for
now
at
last
he
said
i
shall
surely
find
him
though
it
be
alone
and
later
than
my
brethren
this
is
the
place
of
which
the
hebrew
exile
told
me
that
the
prophets
had
spoken
and
here
i
shall
behold
the
rising
of
the
great
light
but
i
must
inquire
about
the
visit
of
my
brethren
and
to
what
house
the
star
directed
them
and
to
whom
they
presented
their
tribute
the
streets
of
the
village
seemed
to
be
deserted
and
artaban
wondered
whether
the
men
had
all
gone
up
to
the
to
bring
down
their
sheep
from
the
open
door
of
a
low
stone
cottage
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
woman
voice
singing
softly
he
entered
and
found
a
young
mother
hushing
her
baby
to
rest
she
told
him
of
the
strangers
from
the
far
east
who
had
appeared
in
the
village
three
days
ago
and
how
they
said
that
a
star
had
guided
them
to
the
place
where
joseph
of
nazareth
was
lodging
with
his
wife
and
her
child
and
how
they
had
paid
reverence
to
the
child
and
given
him
many
rich
gifts
but
the
travellers
disappeared
again
she
continued
as
suddenly
as
they
had
come
we
were
afraid
at
the
strangeness
of
their
visit
we
could
not
understand
it
the
man
of
nazareth
took
the
babe
and
his
mother
and
fled
away
that
same
night
secretly
and
it
was
whispered
that
they
were
going
far
away
to
egypt
ever
since
there
has
been
a
spell
upon
the
village
something
evil
hangs
over
it
they
say
that
the
roman
soldiers
are
coming
from
jerusalem
to
force
a
new
tax
from
us
and
the
men
have
driven
the
flocks
and
herds
far
back
among
the
hills
and
hidden
themselves
to
escape
it
artaban
listened
to
her
gentle
timid
speech
and
the
child
in
her
arms
looked
up
in
his
face
and
smiled
stretching
out
its
rosy
hands
to
grasp
at
the
winged
circle
of
gold
on
his
breast
his
heart
warmed
to
the
touch
it
seemed
like
a
greeting
of
love
and
trust
to
one
who
had
journeyed
long
in
loneliness
and
perplexity
fighting
with
his
own
doubts
and
fears
and
following
a
light
that
was
veiled
in
clouds
might
not
this
child
have
been
the
promised
prince
he
asked
within
himself
as
he
touched
its
soft
cheek
kings
have
been
born
ere
now
in
lowlier
houses
than
this
and
the
favourite
of
the
stars
may
rise
even
from
a
cottage
but
it
has
not
seemed
good
to
the
god
of
wisdom
to
reward
my
search
so
soon
and
so
easily
the
one
whom
i
seek
has
gone
before
me
and
now
i
must
follow
the
king
to
egypt
the
young
mother
laid
the
babe
in
its
cradle
and
rose
to
minister
to
the
wants
of
the
strange
guest
that
fate
had
brought
into
her
house
she
set
food
before
him
the
plain
fare
of
peasants
but
willingly
offered
and
therefore
full
of
refreshment
for
the
soul
as
well
as
for
the
body
artaban
accepted
it
gratefully
and
as
he
ate
the
child
fell
into
a
happy
slumber
and
murmured
sweetly
in
its
dreams
and
a
great
peace
filled
the
quiet
room
but
suddenly
there
came
the
noise
of
a
wild
confusion
and
uproar
in
the
streets
of
the
village
a
shrieking
and
wailing
of
women
voices
a
clangor
of
brazen
trumpets
and
a
clashing
of
swords
and
a
desperate
cry
the
soldiers
the
soldiers
of
herod
they
are
killing
our
children
the
young
mother
face
grew
white
with
terror
she
clasped
her
child
to
her
bosom
and
crouched
motionless
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
covering
him
with
the
folds
of
her
robe
lest
he
should
wake
and
cry
but
artaban
went
quickly
and
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
his
broad
shoulders
filled
the
portal
from
side
to
side
and
the
peak
of
his
white
cap
all
but
touched
the
lintel
illustration
there
is
none
here
save
me
the
soldiers
came
hurrying
down
the
street
with
bloody
hands
and
dripping
swords
at
the
sight
of
the
stranger
in
his
imposing
dress
they
hesitated
with
surprise
the
captain
of
the
band
approached
the
threshold
to
thrust
him
aside
but
artaban
did
not
stir
his
face
was
as
calm
as
though
he
were
watching
the
stars
and
in
his
eyes
there
burned
that
steady
radiance
before
which
even
the
hunting
leopard
shrinks
and
the
fierce
bloodhound
pauses
in
his
leap
he
held
the
soldier
silently
for
an
instant
and
then
said
in
a
low
voice
there
is
no
one
in
this
place
but
me
and
i
am
waiting
to
give
this
jewel
to
the
prudent
captain
who
will
leave
me
in
peace
he
showed
the
ruby
glistening
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
like
a
great
drop
of
blood
the
captain
was
amazed
at
the
splendour
of
the
gem
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
expanded
with
desire
and
the
hard
lines
of
greed
wrinkled
around
his
lips
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
the
ruby
march
on
he
cried
to
his
men
there
is
no
child
here
the
house
is
still
the
clamour
and
the
clang
of
arms
passed
down
the
street
as
the
headlong
fury
of
the
chase
sweeps
by
the
secret
covert
where
the
trembling
deer
is
hidden
artaban
the
cottage
he
turned
his
face
to
the
east
and
prayed
god
of
truth
forgive
my
sin
i
have
said
the
thing
that
is
not
to
save
the
life
of
a
child
and
two
of
my
gifts
are
gone
i
have
spent
for
man
that
which
was
meant
for
god
shall
i
ever
be
worthy
to
see
the
face
of
the
king
but
the
voice
of
the
woman
weeping
for
joy
in
the
shadow
behind
him
said
very
gently
because
thou
hast
saved
the
life
of
my
little
one
may
the
lord
bless
thee
and
keep
thee
the
lord
make
his
face
to
shine
upon
thee
and
be
gracious
unto
thee
the
lord
lift
up
his
countenance
upon
thee
and
give
thee
peace
in
the
hidden
way
of
sorrow
then
again
there
was
a
silence
in
the
hall
of
dreams
deeper
and
more
mysterious
than
the
first
interval
and
i
understood
that
the
years
of
artaban
were
flowing
very
swiftly
under
the
stillness
of
that
clinging
fog
and
i
caught
only
a
glimpse
here
and
there
of
the
river
of
his
life
shining
through
the
shadows
that
concealed
its
course
i
saw
him
moving
among
the
throngs
of
men
in
populous
egypt
seeking
everywhere
for
traces
of
the
household
that
had
come
down
from
bethlehem
and
finding
them
under
the
spreading
of
heliopolis
and
beneath
the
walls
of
the
roman
fortress
of
new
babylon
beside
the
nile
traces
so
faint
and
dim
that
they
vanished
before
him
continually
as
footprints
on
the
hard
glisten
for
a
moment
with
moisture
and
then
disappear
i
saw
him
again
at
the
foot
of
the
pyramids
which
lifted
their
sharp
points
into
the
intense
saffron
glow
of
the
sunset
sky
changeless
monuments
of
the
perishable
glory
and
the
imperishable
hope
of
man
he
looked
up
into
the
vast
countenance
of
the
crouching
sphinx
and
vainly
tried
to
read
the
meaning
of
her
calm
eyes
and
smiling
mouth
was
it
indeed
the
mockery
of
all
effort
and
all
aspiration
as
tigranes
had
said
the
cruel
jest
of
a
riddle
that
has
no
answer
a
search
that
never
can
succeed
or
was
there
a
touch
of
pity
and
encouragement
in
that
inscrutable
smile
a
promise
that
even
the
defeated
should
attain
a
victory
and
the
disappointed
should
discover
a
prize
and
the
ignorant
should
be
made
wise
and
the
blind
should
see
and
the
wandering
should
come
into
the
haven
at
last
i
saw
him
again
in
an
obscure
house
of
alexandria
taking
counsel
with
a
hebrew
rabbi
the
venerable
man
bending
over
the
rolls
of
parchment
on
which
the
prophecies
of
israel
were
written
read
aloud
the
pathetic
words
which
foretold
the
sufferings
of
the
promised
messiah
the
despised
and
rejected
of
men
the
man
of
sorrows
and
the
acquaintance
of
grief
and
remember
my
son
said
he
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
face
of
artaban
the
king
whom
you
are
seeking
is
not
to
be
found
in
a
palace
nor
among
the
rich
and
powerful
if
the
light
of
the
world
and
the
glory
of
israel
had
been
appointed
to
come
with
the
greatness
of
earthly
splendour
it
must
have
appeared
long
ago
for
no
son
of
abraham
will
ever
again
rival
the
power
which
joseph
had
in
the
palaces
of
egypt
or
the
magnificence
of
solomon
throned
between
the
lions
in
jerusalem
but
the
light
for
which
the
world
is
waiting
is
a
new
light
the
glory
that
shall
rise
out
of
patient
and
triumphant
suffering
and
the
kingdom
which
is
to
be
established
forever
is
a
new
kingdom
the
royalty
of
perfect
and
unconquerable
love
i
do
not
know
how
this
shall
come
to
pass
nor
how
the
turbulent
kings
and
peoples
of
earth
shall
be
brought
to
acknowledge
the
messiah
and
pay
homage
to
him
but
this
i
know
those
who
seek
him
will
do
well
to
look
among
the
poor
and
the
lowly
the
sorrowful
and
the
oppressed
illustration
he
healed
the
sick
so
i
saw
the
other
wise
man
again
and
again
travelling
from
place
to
place
and
searching
among
the
people
of
the
dispersion
with
whom
the
little
family
from
bethlehem
might
perhaps
have
found
a
refuge
he
passed
through
countries
where
famine
lay
heavy
upon
the
land
and
the
poor
were
crying
for
bread
he
made
his
dwelling
in
cities
where
the
sick
were
languishing
in
the
bitter
companionship
of
helpless
misery
he
visited
the
oppressed
and
the
afflicted
in
the
gloom
of
subterranean
prisons
and
the
crowded
wretchedness
of
and
the
weary
toil
of
in
all
this
populous
and
intricate
world
of
anguish
though
he
found
none
to
worship
he
found
many
to
help
he
fed
the
hungry
and
clothed
the
naked
and
healed
the
sick
and
comforted
the
captive
and
his
years
went
by
more
swiftly
than
the
weaver
shuttle
that
flashes
back
and
forth
through
the
loom
while
the
web
grows
and
the
invisible
pattern
is
completed
it
seemed
almost
as
if
he
had
forgotten
his
quest
but
once
i
saw
him
for
a
moment
as
he
stood
alone
at
sunrise
waiting
at
the
gate
of
a
roman
prison
he
had
taken
from
a
secret
in
his
bosom
the
pearl
the
last
of
his
jewels
as
he
looked
at
it
a
mellower
lustre
a
soft
and
iridescent
light
full
of
shifting
gleams
of
azure
and
rose
trembled
upon
its
surface
it
seemed
to
have
absorbed
some
reflection
of
the
colours
of
the
lost
sapphire
and
ruby
so
the
profound
secret
purpose
of
a
noble
life
draws
into
itself
the
memories
of
past
joy
and
past
sorrow
all
that
has
helped
it
all
that
has
hindered
it
is
transfused
by
a
subtle
magic
into
its
very
essence
it
becomes
more
luminous
and
precious
the
longer
it
is
carried
close
to
the
warmth
of
the
beating
heart
then
at
last
while
i
was
thinking
of
this
pearl
and
of
its
meaning
i
heard
the
end
of
the
story
of
the
other
wise
man
a
pearl
of
great
price
years
of
the
life
of
artaban
had
passed
away
and
he
was
still
a
pilgrim
and
a
seeker
after
light
his
hair
once
darker
than
the
cliffs
of
zagros
was
now
white
as
the
wintry
snow
that
covered
them
his
eyes
that
once
flashed
like
flames
of
fire
were
dull
as
embers
smouldering
among
the
ashes
worn
and
weary
and
ready
to
die
but
still
looking
for
the
king
he
had
come
for
the
last
time
to
jerusalem
he
had
often
visited
the
holy
city
before
and
had
searched
through
all
its
lanes
and
crowded
hovels
and
black
prisons
without
finding
any
trace
of
the
family
of
nazarenes
who
had
fled
from
bethlehem
long
ago
but
now
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
make
one
more
effort
and
something
whispered
in
his
heart
that
at
last
he
might
succeed
it
was
the
season
of
the
passover
the
city
was
thronged
with
strangers
the
children
of
israel
scattered
in
far
lands
all
over
the
world
had
returned
to
the
temple
for
the
great
feast
and
there
had
been
a
confusion
of
tongues
in
the
narrow
streets
for
many
days
but
on
this
day
there
was
a
singular
agitation
visible
in
the
multitude
the
sky
was
veiled
with
a
portentous
gloom
and
currents
of
excitement
seemed
to
flash
through
the
crowd
like
the
thrill
which
shakes
the
forest
on
the
eve
of
a
storm
a
secret
tide
was
sweeping
them
all
one
way
the
clatter
of
sandals
and
the
soft
thick
sound
of
thousands
of
bare
feet
shuffling
over
the
stones
flowed
unceasingly
along
the
street
that
leads
to
the
damascus
gate
artaban
joined
company
with
a
group
of
people
from
his
own
country
parthian
jews
who
had
come
up
to
keep
the
passover
and
inquired
of
them
the
cause
of
the
tumult
and
where
they
were
going
we
are
going
they
answered
to
the
place
called
golgotha
outside
the
city
walls
where
there
is
to
be
an
execution
have
you
not
heard
what
has
happened
two
famous
robbers
are
to
be
crucified
and
with
them
another
called
jesus
of
nazareth
a
man
who
has
done
many
wonderful
works
among
the
people
so
that
they
love
him
greatly
but
the
priests
and
elders
have
said
that
he
must
die
because
he
gave
himself
out
to
be
the
son
of
god
and
pilate
has
sent
him
to
the
cross
because
he
said
that
he
was
the
of
the
jews
how
strangely
these
familiar
words
fell
upon
the
tired
heart
of
artaban
they
had
led
him
for
a
lifetime
over
land
and
sea
and
now
they
came
to
him
darkly
and
mysteriously
like
a
message
of
despair
the
king
had
arisen
but
he
had
been
denied
and
cast
out
he
was
about
to
perish
perhaps
he
was
already
dying
could
it
be
the
same
who
had
been
born
in
bethlehem
years
ago
at
whose
birth
the
star
had
appeared
in
heaven
and
of
whose
coming
the
prophets
had
spoken
artaban
heart
beat
unsteadily
with
that
troubled
doubtful
apprehension
which
is
the
excitement
of
old
age
but
he
said
within
himself
the
ways
of
god
are
stranger
than
the
thoughts
of
men
and
it
may
be
that
i
shall
find
the
king
at
last
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
and
shall
come
in
time
to
offer
my
pearl
for
his
ransom
before
he
dies
so
the
old
man
followed
the
multitude
with
slow
and
painful
steps
towards
the
damascus
gate
of
the
city
just
beyond
the
entrance
of
the
a
troop
of
macedonian
soldiers
came
down
the
street
dragging
a
young
girl
with
torn
dress
and
dishevelled
hair
as
the
magian
paused
to
look
at
her
with
compassion
she
broke
suddenly
from
the
hands
of
her
tormentors
and
threw
herself
at
his
feet
clasping
him
around
the
knees
she
had
seen
his
white
cap
and
the
winged
circle
on
his
breast
illustration
the
old
man
followed
the
multitude
have
pity
on
me
she
cried
and
save
me
for
the
sake
of
the
god
of
purity
i
also
am
a
daughter
of
the
true
religion
which
is
taught
by
the
magi
my
father
was
a
merchant
of
parthia
but
he
is
dead
and
i
am
seized
for
his
debts
to
be
sold
as
a
slave
save
me
from
worse
than
death
artaban
trembled
it
was
the
old
conflict
in
his
soul
which
had
come
to
him
in
the
of
babylon
and
in
the
cottage
at
bethlehem
the
conflict
between
the
expectation
of
faith
and
the
impulse
of
love
twice
the
gift
which
he
had
consecrated
to
the
worship
of
religion
had
been
drawn
from
his
hand
to
the
service
of
humanity
this
was
the
third
trial
the
ultimate
probation
the
final
and
irrevocable
choice
was
it
his
great
opportunity
or
his
last
temptation
he
could
not
tell
one
thing
only
was
clear
in
the
darkness
of
his
mind
it
was
inevitable
and
does
not
the
inevitable
come
from
god
one
thing
only
was
sure
to
his
divided
heart
to
rescue
this
helpless
girl
would
be
a
true
deed
of
love
and
is
not
love
the
light
of
the
soul
he
took
the
pearl
from
his
bosom
never
had
it
seemed
so
luminous
so
radiant
so
full
of
tender
living
lustre
he
laid
it
in
the
hand
of
the
slave
this
is
thy
ransom
daughter
it
is
the
last
of
my
treasures
which
i
kept
for
the
king
while
he
spoke
the
darkness
of
the
sky
thickened
and
shuddering
tremors
ran
through
the
earth
heaving
convulsively
like
the
breast
of
one
who
struggles
with
mighty
grief
the
walls
of
the
houses
rocked
to
and
fro
stones
were
loosened
and
crashed
into
the
street
dust
clouds
filled
the
air
the
soldiers
fled
in
terror
reeling
like
drunken
men
but
artaban
and
the
girl
whom
he
had
ransomed
crouched
helpless
beneath
the
wall
of
the
praetorium
what
had
he
to
fear
what
had
he
to
live
for
he
had
given
away
the
last
remnant
of
his
tribute
for
the
king
he
had
parted
with
the
last
hope
of
finding
him
the
quest
was
over
and
it
had
failed
but
even
in
that
thought
accepted
and
embraced
there
was
peace
it
was
not
resignation
it
was
not
submission
it
was
something
more
profound
and
searching
he
knew
that
all
was
well
because
he
had
done
the
best
that
he
could
from
day
to
day
he
had
been
true
to
the
light
that
had
been
given
to
him
he
had
looked
for
more
and
if
he
had
not
found
it
if
a
failure
was
all
that
came
out
of
his
life
doubtless
that
was
the
best
that
was
possible
he
had
not
seen
the
revelation
of
life
everlasting
incorruptible
and
immortal
but
he
knew
that
even
if
he
could
live
his
earthly
life
over
again
it
could
not
be
otherwise
than
it
had
been
one
more
lingering
pulsation
of
the
earthquake
quivered
through
the
ground
a
heavy
tile
shaken
from
the
roof
fell
and
struck
the
old
man
on
the
temple
he
lay
breathless
and
pale
with
his
gray
head
resting
on
the
young
girl
shoulder
and
the
blood
trickling
from
the
wound
as
she
bent
over
him
fearing
that
he
was
dead
there
came
a
voice
through
the
twilight
very
small
and
still
like
music
sounding
from
a
distance
in
which
the
notes
are
clear
but
the
words
are
lost
the
girl
turned
to
see
if
some
one
had
spoken
from
the
window
above
them
but
she
saw
no
one
then
the
old
man
lips
began
to
move
as
if
in
answer
and
she
heard
him
say
in
the
parthian
tongue
not
so
my
lord
for
when
saw
i
thee
an
hungered
and
fed
thee
or
thirsty
and
gave
thee
drink
when
saw
i
thee
a
stranger
and
took
thee
in
or
naked
and
clothed
thee
when
saw
i
thee
sick
or
in
prison
and
came
unto
thee
years
have
i
looked
for
thee
but
i
have
never
seen
thy
face
nor
ministered
to
thee
my
king
he
ceased
and
the
sweet
voice
came
again
and
again
the
maid
heard
it
very
faintly
and
far
away
but
now
it
seemed
as
though
she
understood
the
words
i
say
unto
thee
inasmuch
as
thou
hast
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
thou
hast
done
it
unto
illustration
the
other
wise
man
had
found
the
king
a
calm
radiance
of
wonder
and
joy
lighted
the
pale
face
of
artaban
like
the
first
ray
of
dawn
on
a
snowy
one
long
last
breath
of
relief
exhaled
gently
from
his
lips
his
journey
was
ended
his
treasures
were
accepted
the
other
wise
man
had
found
the
king
