egocentric
unless
we

its
purity
never

it

potters
johnny
and
jane
potter
being
twins
went
through
oxford
together
johnny
came
up
from
rugby
and
jane
from
roedean
johnny
was
at
balliol
and
jane
at
somerville
both
having
ambitions
for
literary
careers
took
the
honours
school
of
english
language
and
literature
they
were
ordinary
enough
young
people
clever
without
being
brilliant
without
being
handsome
active
without
being
athletic
keen
without
being
earnest
popular
without
being
leaders
without
being
generous
as
revolutionary
as
selfish
and
as
intellectually
snobbish
as
was
proper
to
their
years
and
inclined
to
be
jealous
one
of
the
other
but
linked
together
by
common
tastes
and
by
a
deep
and
bitter
distaste
for
their
father
newspapers
which
were
many
and
for
their
novels
which
were
more
these
were
indeed
not
fit
for
perusal
at
somerville
and
balliol
the
danger
had
been
that
somerville
and
balliol
till
they
knew
you
well
should
not
know
you
knew
it
in
their
first
year
the
mother
of
johnny
and
jane
yorke
with
potter
in
brackets
after
it
had
after
spending
eights
week
at
oxford
announced
her
intention
of
writing
an
oxford
novel
oh
god
jane
had
cried
within
herself
not
that
anything
but
that
and
firmly
she
and
johnny
had
told
her
mother
that
already
there
were
and
and
and
girls
of
by
annie
swan
the
races
were
over
the
girls
sculled
their
college
barge
briskly
down
the
river
and
that
in
short
the
thing
had
been
done
for
good
and
all
and
that
was
that
potter
still
thought
she
would
like
to
write
an
oxford
novel
because
after
all
though
there
might
be
many
already
none
of
them
were
quite
like
the
one
she
would
write
she
had
tea
with
jane
in
the
somerville
garden
on
sunday
and
though
jane
did
not
ask
any
of
her
friends
to
meet
her
for
they
might
have
got
put
in
she
saw
them
all
about
and
thought
what
a
nice
novel
they
would
make
jane
knew
she
was
thinking
this
and
said
very
commonplace
people
in
a
discouraging
tone
of
them
jane
added
deserting
her
own
snobbishness
which
was
intellectual
for
her
mother
which
was
social
also
common
must
be
very
many
said
potter
looking
through
her
lorgnette
at
the
garden
of
girls
are
neither
said
jane
stubbornly
you
would
think
most
people
are
one
or
the
other
i
find
many
are
both
not
to
be
cynical
my
pet
said
leila
yorke
who
was
never
this
that
was
in
june
in
june
jane
and
johnny
went
down
their
university
careers
had
been
creditable
if
not
particularly
conspicuous
johnny
had
been
a
fluent
speaker
at
the
union
jane
at
the
women
intercollegiate
debating
society
and
also
in
the
somerville
parliament
where
she
had
been
the
leader
of
the
labour
party
johnny
had
for
a
time
edited
the
jane
the
johnny
had
done
respectably
in
schools
jane
rather
better
for
jane
had
always
been
just
a
shade
the
cleverer
not
enough
to
spoil
competition
but
enough
to
give
johnny
rather
harder
work
to
achieve
the
same
results
they
had
probably
both
got
firsts
but
jane
would
be
a
safe
thing
and
johnny
would
be
likely
to
have
a
longish
anyhow
here
they
were
just
returned
to
potter
bar
herts
where
percy
potter
liking
the
name
of
the
village
had
lately
built
a
lordly
mansion
excellent
friends
they
were
but
as
jealous
as
two
little
dogs
each
for
ever
on
the
to
see
that
the
other
got
no
undue
advantage
both
saw
every
reason
why
they
should
make
a
success
of
life
but
jane
knew
that
though
she
might
be
one
up
on
johnny
as
regards
oxford
owing
to
slightly
superior
brain
power
he
was
one
up
on
her
as
regards
life
owing
to
that
awful
business
sex
women
were
handicapped
they
had
to
fight
much
harder
to
achieve
equal
results
people
give
them
jobs
in
the
same
way
young
men
possessed
the
earth
young
women
had
to
wrest
what
they
wanted
out
of
it
piecemeal
johnny
might
end
a
cabinet
minister
a
notorious
journalist
a
labour
leader
anything
women
jobs
were
as
a
rule
so
dowdy
and
unimportant
jane
was
bored
to
death
with
this
sex
business
it
was
fair
but
jane
was
determined
to
live
it
down
she
would
be
put
off
with
jobs
she
be
dowdy
and
unimportant
like
her
mother
and
the
other
fools
she
would
have
the
best
that
was
going
the
family
dined
at
one
end
of
the
table
was
potter
a
small
person
of
no
presence
you
had
not
thought
he
was
so
great
a
man
as
potter
of
the
potter
press
for
it
was
a
great
press
though
not
so
great
as
the
northcliffe
press
for
it
did
not
produce
anything
so
good
as
the
or
so
bad
as
the
it
was
more
of
a
piece
both
commonplace
and
common
was
percy
potter
according
to
some
standards
but
clever
with
immense
patience
a
saving
sense
of
humour
and
that
imaginative
vision
without
which
no
newspaper
owner
financier
general
politician
poet
or
criminal
can
be
great
he
was
in
fact
greater
than
the
twins
would
ever
be
because
he
was
not
at
odds
with
his
material
he
found
such
stuff
as
his
dreams
were
made
of
ready
to
his
hand
in
the
great
heart
of
the
public
the
last
place
where
the
twins
would
have
thought
of
looking
so
did
his
wife
she
was
and
not
with
the
cold
blue
eyes
and
rather
set
mouth
possessed
inexplicably
by
many
writers
of
fiction
if
i
have
conveyed
the
impression
that
leila
yorke
was
in
the
lowest
division
of
this
class
i
have
done
her
less
than
justice
quite
a
number
of
novelists
were
worse
this
was
not
much
satisfaction
to
her
children
jane
said
you
do
that
sort
of
thing
at
all
you
might
as
well
make
a
job
of
it
and
sell
a
million
copies
i
rather
be
barclay
or
ethel
dell
or
charles
garvice
or
gene
stratton
porter
or
ruby
ayres
than
mother
mother
merely
commonplace
not
even
a
quite
i
admire
dad
more
dad
anyhow
gets
there
his
stuff
sells
potter
novels
as
a
matter
of
fact
sold
quite
creditably
they
were
pleasant
to
many
readable
by
more
and
quite
unmarred
by
any
spark
of
cleverness
flash
of
wit
or
morbid
taint
of
philosophy
gently
and
unsurprisingly
she
wrote
of
life
and
love
as
she
believed
these
two
things
to
be
and
found
a
home
in
the
hearts
of
many
she
bored
no
one
who
read
her
because
she
could
be
relied
on
to
give
them
what
they
hoped
to
find
and
of
how
few
of
us
alas
can
this
be
said
and
she
used
to
say
it
was
because
she
was
a
mother
her
books
were
safe
for
the
youngest
and
in
these
days
even
in
those
days
it
was
so
of
loose
morality
and
frank
realism
how
important
this
is
hope
i
am
as
modern
as
any
one
potter
would
say
i
see
no
call
to
be
indecent
so
many
writers
do
see
or
rather
hear
this
call
and
obey
it
faithfully
that
many
a
parent
was
grateful
to
leila
yorke
it
is
only
fair
to
record
here
that
in
the
year
she
heard
it
herself
and
became
a
psychoanalyst
but
the
time
for
this
was
not
yet
on
her
right
sat
her
eldest
son
frank
who
was
a
curate
in
pimlico
in
frank
face
which
was
sharp
and
thin
like
his
father
were
the
marks
of
some
conflict
which
his
father
did
not
know
you
somehow
felt
that
each
of
the
other
potters
had
one
aim
and
that
frank
had
or
anyhow
felt
that
he
ought
to
have
another
besides
however
feebly
he
aimed
at
it
next
him
sat
his
young
wife
who
had
again
only
the
one
she
was
pretty
and
jolly
and
brunette
and
twisted
frank
round
her
fingers
beyond
her
sat
clare
the
eldest
daughter
and
the
daughter
at
home
she
read
her
mother
novels
and
her
father
papers
and
saw
no
harm
in
either
she
thought
the
twins
perverse
and
conceited
which
came
from
being
clever
at
school
and
college
clare
had
never
been
clever
at
anything
but
domestic
jobs
and
needlework
she
was
a
nice
pretty
girl
and
expected
to
marry
she
snubbed
jane
and
jane
in
her
irritating
and
nonchalant
way
was
rude
to
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
sat
the
twins
stocky
and
and
looking
very
young
with
broad
jaws
and
foreheads
and
gray
eyes
jane
was
to
look
at
something
like
an
attractive
little
plump
white
pig
it
is
not
necessary
at
the
moment
to
say
more
about
her
appearance
than
this
except
that
when
the
time
came
to
bob
the
hair
she
bobbed
it
johnny
was
as
sturdy
but
rather
less
chubby
and
his
chin
stuck
out
farther
they
had
the
same
kind
of
smile
and
square
white
teeth
and
were
greedy
when
they
had
been
little
they
had
watched
each
plates
with
hostile
eyes
to
see
that
neither
got
too
large
a
helping
those
of
us
who
are
old
enough
will
remember
that
in
june
and
july
the
conversation
turned
largely
and
tediously
on
militant
suffragists
irish
rebels
and
strikers
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
age
of
violent
enforcements
of
decision
by
physical
action
which
has
lasted
ever
since
and
shows
as
yet
no
signs
of
passing
the
potter
press
like
so
many
other
presses
snubbed
the
militant
suffragists
smiled
half
approvingly
on
carson
rebels
and
frowned
wholly
disapprovingly
on
the
strikers
it
was
a
curious
age
so
near
and
yet
so
far
when
the
ordered
frame
of
things
was
still
unbroken
and
violence
a
child
dream
and
poetry
and
art
were
taken
with
immense
seriousness
those
of
us
who
can
remember
it
should
do
so
for
it
will
not
return
it
has
given
place
to
the
age
of
melodrama
when
nothing
is
too
strange
to
happen
and
no
one
is
ever
surprised
that
too
may
pass
but
probably
will
not
for
it
is
primeval
the
other
was
artificial
a
mere
product
of
civilisation
and
could
not
last
it
was
in
the
intervals
of
talking
about
the
militants
a
conversation
much
like
other
conversations
on
the
same
topic
which
were
tedious
even
at
the
time
and
now
will
certainly
not
bear
recording
that
frank
said
to
the
twins
are
you
two
going
to
play
at
now
so
extensive
a
question
opening
such
vistas
it
would
have
taken
if
not
less
time
anyhow
less
trouble
to
have
told
frank
what
they
were
going
to
play
at
the
devil
of
mischief
looked
out
of
johnny
gray
eyes
as
he
nearly
said
are
going
to
fight
leila
yorke
fiction
and
the
potter
press
choking
it
back
he
said
succinctly
journalism
and
writing
at
least
i
am
means
potter
interpolated
in
his
small
nasal
voice
he
has
obtained
a
small
and
subordinate
job
with
a
firm
of
publishers
and
hopes
also
to
contribute
to
an
obscure
weekly
paper
run
by
a
friend
of
his
said
frank
one
of
papers
pater
ca
be
if
it
obscure
can
it
not
one
of
my
papers
a
periodical
called
i
believe
the
with
which
you
may
or
may
not
be
familiar
heard
of
it
i
afraid
frank
confessed
truly
you
go
on
to
one
of
the
family
concerns
johnny
you
get
on
much
quicker
there
with
pater
to
shove
you
johnny
agreed
papers
said
potter
dryly
not
quite
up
to
intellectual
level
nor
jane
neither
do
they
accord
with
their
political
sympathies
i
forgot
you
two
were
silly
old
socialists
never
mind
that
pass
when
they
grow
up
wo
it
frank
secretly
frank
thought
that
the
twins
had
the
disease
because
the
potter
family
however
respectable
now
was
really
funny
old
pater
had
every
one
knew
begun
his
career
as
a
reporter
on
a
provincial
paper
if
funny
old
pater
had
been
just
a
shade
less
clever
or
enterprising
his
family
would
have
been
educated
at
grammar
schools
and
gone
into
business
in
their
teens
of
course
potter
had
pulled
the
social
level
up
a
bit
but
what
if
you
came
to
that
had
potter
been
only
the
daughter
of
a
country
doctor
only
the
underpaid
secretary
of
a
lady
novelist
for
all
she
was
so
conceited
now
so
naturally
socialism
that
disease
of
the
underbred
had
taken
hold
of
the
less
careful
of
the
potter
young
are
you
going
to
write
for
this
weekly
too
jane
frank
inquired
i
not
got
a
job
yet
i
going
to
look
round
a
little
first
that
sense
have
a
good
time
at
home
for
a
bit
well
it
time
you
had
a
holiday
is
it
i
wish
old
frank
could
he
working
like
an
old
horse
he
may
slave
himself
to
death
for
those
pimlico
pigs
for
all
any
of
them
care
it
never
thank
you
it
always
more
more
more
with
them
that
your
socialism
johnny
the
twins
got
on
very
well
with
their
but
thought
her
a
fool
when
as
she
was
fond
of
doing
she
mentioned
socialism
they
rightly
believing
her
grasp
of
that
economic
system
to
be
even
less
complete
than
that
of
most
people
always
changed
the
subject
but
on
this
occasion
they
did
not
have
time
to
change
it
before
clare
said
writing
a
novel
about
socialism
she
shows
it
up
like
anything
potter
smiled
confess
i
am
trying
my
hand
at
the
burning
subject
but
as
for
showing
it
up
well
i
am
being
fair
to
both
sides
i
think
i
feel
i
can
quite
condemn
it
wholesale
as
peggy
does
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
treat
anything
like
that
i
ca
help
seeing
all
round
a
thing
i
told
it
a
weakness
and
that
i
should
get
on
better
if
i
saw
everything
in
black
and
white
as
so
many
people
do
but
it
no
use
my
trying
to
alter
at
my
time
of
life
one
has
to
write
in
one
own
way
or
not
at
all
said
clare
going
to
be
a
ripping
book
quite
one
of
your
best
mother
clare
had
always
been
her
mother
great
in
the
matter
of
literature
she
was
also
useful
as
a
touchstone
as
what
her
mother
did
not
call
a
foolometer
if
a
book
went
with
clare
it
went
with
leila
yorke
public
beyond
potter
was
a
less
satisfactory
reader
he
regarded
his
wife
books
as
goods
for
sale
and
his
comments
were
should
go
all
right
that
done
it
which
attitude
though
commercially
helpful
was
less
really
satisfying
to
the
creator
than
uncritical
absorption
in
the
characters
and
the
story
clare
was
in
fact
the
public
while
potter
was
more
the
salesman
and
the
twins
were
neither
but
more
like
the
less
agreeable
type
of
reviewer
when
they
deigned
to
read
or
comment
on
their
mother
books
at
all
which
was
not
always
johnny
attitude
towards
his
mother
suggested
that
he
might
say
politely
if
she
mentioned
her
books
do
you
write
why
potter
was
rather
sadly
aware
that
she
made
no
appeal
to
the
twins
but
then
as
clare
reminded
her
the
twins
since
they
had
gone
to
oxford
never
admitted
that
they
cared
for
any
books
that
normal
people
cared
for
they
were
like
that
conceited
and
contrary
to
change
the
subject
so
many
subjects
are
the
better
for
being
changed
as
all
those
who
know
family
life
will
agree
jane
said
and
i
are
going
on
a
next
month
little
late
in
the
day
is
it
commented
frank
the
only
one
who
knew
oxford
habits
it
to
look
up
all
the
howlers
you
made
jane
admitted
wo
be
so
much
reading
really
as
observing
it
a
party
of
investigation
as
a
matter
of
fact
do
you
investigate
beetles
or
social
conditions
their
tastes
habits
outlook
and
mental
diseases
what
they
want
and
why
they
want
it
and
what
the
cure
is
we
belong
to
a
society
for
inquiring
into
such
things
would
said
clare
who
always
rose
when
the
twins
meant
her
to
they
cautions
said
frank
more
potter
said
a
very
interesting
idea
i
think
i
must
join
this
society
it
would
help
me
in
my
work
what
is
it
called
children
said
jane
and
had
the
grace
to
look
ashamed
really
hardly
exists
yet
but
as
she
said
it
she
met
the
sharp
and
shrewd
eyes
of
potter
and
knew
that
he
knew
she
was
referring
to
the
league
potter
would
not
indeed
have
been
worthy
of
his
reputation
had
he
not
been
aware
from
its
inception
of
the
existence
of
this
league
journalists
have
to
be
aware
of
such
things
he
in
no
way
resented
the
league
he
brushed
it
aside
as
of
no
account
and
indeed
it
was
not
aimed
at
him
personally
nor
at
his
wife
personally
but
at
the
great
mass
of
thought
or
of
incoherent
muddled
emotion
that
passed
for
thought
which
the
had
agreed
for
brevity
sake
to
call
potterism
had
very
certainly
not
been
created
by
the
potters
and
was
indeed
no
better
represented
by
the
goods
with
which
they
supplied
the
market
than
by
those
of
many
others
but
it
was
a
handy
name
and
it
had
taken
the
public
fancy
that
here
you
had
two
potters
linked
together
two
souls
nobly
yoked
one
supplying
potterism
in
fictional
the
other
in
newspaper
form
so
the
name
caught
about
the
year
the
twins
both
heard
it
used
at
oxford
in
their
second
year
they
recognised
its
meaning
without
being
told
and
both
felt
that
it
was
up
to
them
to
take
the
opportunity
of
testifying
of
severing
any
connection
that
might
yet
exist
in
any
one
mind
between
them
and
the
other
products
of
their
parents
they
did
so
with
the
uncompromising
decision
proper
to
their
years
and
with
perhaps
the
touch
of
indecency
regardlessness
of
the
proprieties
which
was
characteristic
of
them
their
friends
soon
discovered
that
they
need
not
guard
their
tongues
in
speaking
of
potterism
before
the
potter
twins
the
way
the
twins
put
it
was
family
is
responsible
for
more
than
its
share
of
the
beastly
thing
the
least
we
can
do
is
to
help
to
do
it
in
which
sounded
chivalrous
and
another
way
they
put
it
was
not
going
to
have
any
one
connecting
with
it
which
sounded
sensible
so
they
joined
the
league
not
blind
to
the
piquant
humour
of
their
being
found
therein
potter
said
to
the
twins
in
his
thin
little
voice
mind
mother
and
me
children
tell
us
all
about
the
it
may
do
us
good
but
the
twins
knew
it
would
not
do
their
mother
good
it
would
need
too
much
explanation
and
then
she
would
still
not
understand
she
might
even
be
very
angry
as
she
was
though
she
pretended
she
was
only
amused
with
some
reviewers
if
your
mother
is
leila
yorke
and
has
hard
blue
eyes
and
no
sense
of
humour
but
a
most
enormous
sense
of
importance
you
can
not
or
you
had
better
not
even
begin
to
explain
to
her
things
like
potterism
or
the
league
and
still
less
how
it
is
that
you
belong
to
the
latter
the
twins
who
had
got
firsts
in
schools
knew
this
much
johnny
improvised
hastily
with
innocent
gray
eyes
on
his
father
one
of
the
rules
that
you
may
talk
about
it
outside
league
it
is
you
see
for
letting
other
people
alone
said
potter
who
was
not
spiteful
to
his
children
and
preferred
his
wife
unruffled
let
you
off
this
time
but
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
it
a
silly
business
mother
and
i
will
last
a
great
deal
longer
than
it
does
because
we
take
our
stand
on
human
nature
and
you
wo
destroy
that
with
leagues
sometimes
the
twins
were
really
almost
afraid
they
would
all
very
cryptic
frank
said
and
yawned
then
potter
and
the
girls
left
the
and
frank
and
his
father
discussed
the
disestablishment
of
the
church
in
wales
a
measure
which
frank
thought
would
be
a
pity
but
which
was
advocated
by
the
potter
press
johnny
cracked
nuts
in
silence
he
thought
the
church
insincere
a
job
but
that
dissenters
were
worse
they
should
all
be
abolished
with
other
shams
for
a
short
time
at
oxford
he
had
given
the
church
a
trial
even
felt
real
admiration
for
it
under
the
influence
of
his
friend
juke
and
after
hearing
sermons
from
father
waggett
dearmer
and
canon
adderley
but
he
had
soon
given
it
up
seen
it
would
do
the
priests
were
not
representative
the
church
as
a
whole
canted
was
hypocritical
and
potterish
and
must
go
chapter
ii
the
quest
of
potterism
its
causes
and
its
cure
took
the
party
of
investigation
first
to
the
cornish
coast
partly
because
of
bathing
and
boating
and
partly
because
gideon
the
organiser
of
the
party
wanted
to
find
out
if
there
was
much
potterism
in
cornwall
or
if
celticism
had
withstood
it
for
potterism
they
had
decided
was
mainly
an
disease
worst
of
all
in
america
that
great
home
of
commerce
success
and
the
booming
of
the
less
discernible
in
the
latin
countries
which
they
hoped
later
on
to
explore
and
hardly
existing
in
the
slavs
in
russia
said
gideon
who
loathed
russians
because
he
was
half
a
jew
it
practically
did
not
exist
the
russians
were
without
shame
and
without
cant
saw
things
as
they
were
and
proceeded
to
make
them
a
good
deal
worse
that
was
barbarity
imbecility
and
devilishness
but
it
was
not
potterism
said
gideon
grimly
gideon
grandparents
had
been
massacred
in
an
odessa
pogrom
his
father
had
been
taken
at
the
age
of
five
to
england
by
an
aunt
become
naturalised
taken
the
name
of
sidney
married
an
englishwoman
and
achieved
success
and
wealth
as
a
banker
his
son
arthur
was
one
of
the
most
brilliant
men
of
his
year
at
oxford
regarded
russians
jews
and
british
with
cynical
dislike
and
had
on
turning
reverted
to
his
family
name
in
its
english
form
finding
it
a
potterish
act
on
his
father
part
to
have
become
sidney
few
of
his
friends
remembered
to
call
him
by
his
new
name
and
his
parents
ignored
it
but
to
wear
it
gave
him
a
grim
satisfaction
such
was
arthur
gideon
a
man
biting
his
nails
like
fagin
when
he
got
excited
the
other
man
besides
johnny
potter
was
the
honourable
laurence
juke
a
radical
of
moderately
aristocratic
lineage
a
clever
writer
and
actor
who
had
just
taken
deacon
orders
juke
had
a
look
at
once
languid
and
amused
a
smooth
brown
head
blunt
features
the
introspective
eyes
of
the
mystic
and
the
sweet
flexible
voice
of
the
actor
his
mother
had
in
fact
been
a
actress
of
the
eighties
the
two
women
were
jane
potter
and
katherine
varick
katherine
varick
had
frosty
blue
eyes
a
pale
slightly
cynical
face
a
first
in
natural
science
and
a
chemical
research
fellowship
in
those
happy
days
it
was
easy
to
stay
in
places
even
by
the
sea
and
they
stayed
first
at
the
fishing
village
of
mevagissey
gideon
was
the
only
one
who
never
forgot
that
they
were
to
make
observations
and
write
a
book
he
came
of
a
more
race
than
the
others
did
often
the
others
merely
fished
boated
bathed
and
walked
and
forgot
the
object
of
their
tour
but
gideon
though
he
too
did
these
things
did
them
so
to
speak
notebook
in
hand
he
was
out
to
find
and
analyse
potterism
so
much
of
it
as
lay
hid
in
the
rocky
cornish
coves
and
the
grave
cornish
people
katherine
varick
was
the
only
member
of
the
party
who
knew
that
he
was
also
seeking
and
finding
it
in
the
hidden
souls
of
his
they
would
meet
in
the
evening
with
the
various
contributions
to
the
subject
which
they
had
gathered
during
the
day
the
urban
district
council
said
johnny
wanted
to
pull
down
the
village
street
and
build
an
esplanade
to
attract
visitors
all
the
villagers
seemed
pleased
that
was
potterism
the
welcoming
of
ugliness
and
prosperity
the
antithesis
of
the
artist
spirit
which
loved
beauty
for
what
it
was
and
did
not
want
to
exploit
it
their
landlady
said
juke
on
sunday
had
looked
coldly
on
him
when
he
went
out
with
his
fishing
rod
in
the
morning
this
would
not
have
been
potterism
but
merely
a
respectable
bigotry
had
the
lady
had
genuine
conscientious
scruples
as
to
this
use
of
sunday
morning
by
the
clergy
but
juke
had
ascertained
tactfully
that
she
had
no
conscientious
scruples
about
anything
at
all
so
it
was
merely
propriety
and
cant
in
brief
potterism
later
he
had
landed
at
a
village
down
the
coast
and
been
to
church
church
he
said
the
most
unpleasant
piece
of
potterism
i
have
seen
for
some
time
perpendicular
but
restored
fifty
years
ago
according
to
the
taste
of
the
period
vile
windows
painted
deal
pews
incredible
braying
of
bad
chants
out
of
tune
a
sermon
from
a
fellow
about
going
to
church
why
should
they
go
to
church
he
tell
them
he
just
said
if
they
did
some
being
he
called
god
would
be
angry
with
them
what
did
he
mean
by
god
i
hanged
if
he
ever
thought
it
out
some
being
apparently
like
a
sublimated
potterite
who
rejoices
in
bad
singing
bad
art
bad
praying
and
bad
preaching
and
sits
aloft
to
deal
out
rewards
to
those
who
practise
these
and
punishments
to
those
who
do
the
potter
god
will
save
you
if
you
please
him
that
means
he
save
your
body
from
danger
and
not
let
you
starve
potterism
has
no
notion
of
a
god
who
does
care
a
twopenny
damn
whether
you
starve
or
not
but
does
care
whether
you
following
the
truth
as
you
see
it
in
fact
potterism
has
no
room
for
christianity
it
prefers
the
god
of
the
old
testament
of
course
with
their
abominable
cheek
the
potterites
have
taken
christianity
and
watered
it
down
to
suit
themselves
till
they
produced
a
form
of
potterism
which
they
call
by
its
name
but
they
would
know
the
real
thing
if
they
saw
it
the
pharisees
were
potterites
the
others
listened
to
juke
on
religious
potterism
tolerantly
none
of
them
with
the
doubtful
exception
of
johnny
who
had
not
entirely
made
up
his
mind
believed
in
religion
they
were
quite
prepared
to
agree
that
most
of
its
current
forms
were
soaked
in
potterism
but
they
could
not
be
expected
to
care
as
juke
did
gideon
said
he
had
heard
a
dreadful
band
on
the
beach
and
heard
a
dreadful
fellow
proclaiming
the
precious
blood
that
was
potterism
because
it
was
an
appeal
to
sentiment
over
the
head
or
under
the
head
of
reason
neither
the
speaker
nor
any
one
else
probably
had
the
least
idea
what
he
was
talking
about
or
what
he
meant
had
the
kind
of
face
which
is
always
turned
away
from
facts
gideon
said
are
too
difficult
too
complicated
for
him
hard
jolly
facts
with
clear
sharp
edges
that
you
ca
slur
and
talk
away
potterism
has
no
use
for
them
it
appeals
over
their
heads
to
prejudice
and
sentiment
it
the
very
opposite
to
the
scientific
temper
no
good
scientist
could
conceivably
be
a
potterite
because
he
concerned
with
truth
and
the
kind
of
truth
too
that
it
difficult
to
arrive
at
potterism
is
all
for
short
and
easy
cuts
and
showy
results
science
has
to
work
its
way
step
by
step
and
then
has
much
to
show
for
it
it
is
greedy
potterism
plays
a
game
of
grab
all
the
time
snatches
at
success
in
a
hurry
it
greedy
repeated
gideon
thinking
it
out
watching
jane
firm
little
hand
with
its
short
square
fingers
rooting
in
the
sand
for
shells
jane
had
visited
the
stationer
who
kept
a
circulating
library
and
seen
holiday
visitors
selecting
books
to
read
they
had
nearly
all
chosen
the
most
potterish
they
could
see
and
asked
for
some
more
potterish
still
leaving
conrad
and
hardy
despised
on
the
shelves
but
these
people
were
not
cornish
but
saxon
visitors
and
katherine
had
seen
the
local
paper
but
it
had
been
much
less
potterish
than
most
of
the
london
papers
which
confirmed
them
in
their
theory
about
celts
thus
they
talked
and
discussed
and
played
and
wrote
their
book
in
patches
and
travelled
from
place
to
place
and
thought
that
they
found
things
out
and
gideon
because
he
was
the
cleverest
found
out
the
most
and
katherine
because
she
was
the
next
cleverest
saw
all
that
gideon
found
out
and
juke
because
he
was
religious
was
for
ever
getting
on
to
potterism
its
cure
before
they
had
analysed
the
disease
and
the
twins
enjoyed
life
in
their
usual
serene
way
and
found
it
very
entertaining
to
be
potters
inquiring
into
potterism
the
others
were
scrupulously
fair
in
not
attributing
to
them
because
they
happened
to
be
potters
by
birth
more
potterism
than
they
actually
possessed
a
certain
amount
said
juke
is
part
of
the
of
very
nearly
every
human
being
it
has
to
be
fought
down
like
the
notorious
ape
and
tiger
but
he
thought
that
gideon
and
katherine
varick
had
less
of
it
than
any
one
else
he
knew
the
mediocre
was
repellent
to
them
cant
and
sentiment
made
them
sick
they
made
a
fetish
of
hard
truth
and
so
much
despised
most
of
their
neighbours
that
they
would
not
experience
the
temptation
to
grab
at
popularity
in
fact
they
would
dislike
it
if
it
came
came
out
while
they
were
at
lyme
regis
potter
sent
the
twins
a
copy
in
their
detached
way
the
twins
read
it
and
gave
it
to
the
others
to
look
at
typical
stuff
gideon
summed
it
up
after
a
glance
will
no
doubt
have
an
excellent
sale
it
must
be
interesting
for
you
to
watch
it
being
turned
out
i
wish
you
would
ask
me
to
stay
with
you
some
time
yours
must
be
an
even
more
instructive
household
than
mine
gideon
was
a
russian
jew
on
his
father
side
and
a
harrovian
he
had
no
decency
and
no
manners
he
made
juke
who
was
an
englishman
and
an
etonian
and
had
more
of
both
uncomfortable
sometimes
for
after
all
the
rudiments
of
family
loyalty
might
as
well
be
kept
among
the
general
destruction
which
he
more
sanguinely
than
gideon
hoped
for
but
the
twins
did
not
bother
jane
said
in
her
equable
way
be
bored
to
death
angry
too
but
come
if
you
like
we
a
sister
more
potterish
than
the
parents
she
hate
you
gideon
said
expect
so
and
they
left
his
prospective
visit
at
that
with
jane
chuckling
quietly
at
her
private
vision
of
gideon
and
clare
in
juxtaposition
but
did
not
have
a
good
sale
after
all
it
was
guillotined
with
many
of
its
betters
by
the
european
war
which
began
while
the
were
at
swanage
a
place
replete
with
potterism
potterism
however
as
a
subject
for
investigation
had
by
this
time
given
place
to
international
diplomacy
that
still
more
intriguing
study
the
abused
every
government
concerned
and
gideon
said
on
august
shall
be
fools
if
we
do
come
in
juke
was
still
dubious
he
was
a
good
radical
and
good
radicals
were
dubious
on
this
point
until
the
invasion
of
belgium
throw
back
the
world
a
hundred
years
gideon
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
belonged
to
no
political
party
and
had
the
shrewd
eyes
of
his
father
race
going
to
be
thrown
back
anyhow
germany
will
see
to
that
and
if
we
keep
out
of
it
germany
will
grab
europe
we
got
to
come
in
if
we
can
get
a
decent
pretext
the
decent
pretext
came
in
due
course
and
gideon
said
that
that
he
added
to
the
potters
once
i
am
in
agreement
with
your
press
we
should
be
lunatics
to
stand
out
of
this
damnable
mess
juke
also
was
now
painful
to
him
though
it
was
to
be
so
in
agreement
with
the
potter
press
to
him
the
war
had
become
a
crusade
a
fight
for
decency
against
savagery
that
said
gideon
that
not
all
this
is
a
show
any
country
can
afford
to
stand
out
of
it
germany
against
europe
and
if
europe
does
look
sharp
germany
going
to
win
nearly
as
bad
as
russia
one
would
have
to
emigrate
to
another
hemisphere
no
we
got
to
win
this
racket
but
oh
lord
what
a
mess
he
fell
to
biting
his
nails
savage
and
silent
jane
thought
all
the
time
beneath
her
other
thoughts
about
it
have
a
war
just
when
life
was
beginning
and
going
to
be
such
fun
beneath
her
public
thoughts
about
the
situation
she
felt
this
deep
private
disgust
gnawing
always
as
of
one
defrauded
chapter
iii
opportunity
they
did
not
know
then
about
people
in
general
going
to
the
war
they
thought
it
was
just
for
the
army
and
navy
not
for
ordinary
people
that
idea
came
a
little
later
after
the
party
had
broken
up
and
gone
home
the
young
men
began
to
enlist
and
get
commissions
it
was
done
it
was
the
correct
idea
johnny
potter
who
belonged
to
an
got
a
commission
early
jane
said
within
herself
can
go
and
i
ca
she
knew
she
was
badly
incredibly
left
johnny
was
in
the
movement
doing
the
thing
that
mattered
further
johnny
might
ultimately
be
killed
in
doing
it
her
johnny
everything
else
shrank
and
was
little
what
were
books
what
was
anything
jane
wanted
to
fight
in
the
war
the
war
was
damnable
but
it
was
worse
to
be
out
of
it
one
was
such
an
utter
outsider
it
fair
she
could
fight
as
well
as
johnny
could
jane
went
about
white
and
sullen
with
her
world
tumbling
into
bits
about
her
potter
said
in
the
press
and
potter
in
the
home
people
of
england
have
a
great
opportunity
before
them
we
must
all
try
to
rise
to
it
as
if
the
people
of
england
were
fishes
and
the
opportunity
a
fly
opportunity
thought
jane
where
is
it
i
see
none
it
was
precisely
opportunity
which
the
war
had
put
an
end
to
women
of
england
must
now
prove
that
they
are
worthy
of
their
men
said
the
potter
press
dare
say
thought
jane
knitting
socks
and
packing
stores
and
learning
first
aid
who
wanted
to
do
things
like
that
when
their
brothers
had
a
chance
to
go
and
fight
in
france
men
would
stand
it
if
it
was
the
other
way
round
why
should
women
always
get
the
dull
jobs
it
was
because
they
bore
them
cheerfully
because
they
did
really
for
the
most
part
mind
jane
decided
watching
the
attitude
of
her
mother
and
clare
the
twins
profoundly
selfish
but
loving
adventure
and
placidly
untroubled
by
nerves
or
the
prospect
of
physical
danger
saw
no
hardship
in
active
service
this
was
before
the
first
winter
and
the
development
of
trench
warfare
and
people
pictured
to
themselves
skirmishes
in
the
open
exposed
to
missiles
but
at
least
keeping
warm
every
one
one
knew
was
going
johnny
said
to
jane
is
beastly
but
one
got
to
be
in
it
he
took
that
line
as
so
many
others
did
going
he
said
a
combatant
i
mean
not
a
padre
he
thinks
the
war
could
have
been
prevented
with
a
little
intelligence
so
it
could
i
dare
say
but
as
there
was
a
little
intelligence
and
it
was
prevented
he
going
in
he
says
it
will
be
useful
experience
for
him
help
him
in
his
profession
he
does
believe
in
parsons
standing
outside
things
and
only
doing
soft
jobs
i
agree
with
him
every
one
ought
to
go
one
ca
said
jane
morosely
but
to
johnny
every
one
meant
all
young
men
and
he
took
no
heed
gideon
went
it
might
he
said
to
juke
be
a
capitalists
war
or
any
one
else
the
important
thing
was
not
whose
war
it
was
but
who
was
going
to
win
it
he
added
britain
is
on
this
occasion
on
the
right
side
there
no
manner
of
doubt
about
it
but
even
if
she
was
important
for
all
her
inhabitants
that
she
should
be
on
the
winning
side
oh
she
will
be
no
doubt
we
the
advantage
in
numbers
and
wealth
if
not
in
military
organisation
or
talent
if
only
the
potterites
would
jabber
so
it
a
unique
opportunity
for
them
and
they
taking
it
what
makes
me
angriest
is
the
reasons
they
vamp
up
why
we
fighting
for
the
sake
of
democracy
they
say
democracy
be
hanged
it
a
rotten
system
anyhow
and
how
this
war
is
going
to
do
anything
for
it
i
do
know
if
i
thought
it
was
i
would
join
but
there
no
fear
and
other
people
say
we
fighting
so
that
our
children
wo
have
to
rot
again
every
war
makes
other
wars
more
likely
why
ca
people
say
simply
that
the
reason
why
we
fighting
is
partly
to
uphold
decent
international
principles
and
mainly
to
win
the
war
to
be
a
conquering
nation
not
a
conquered
one
and
to
save
ourselves
from
having
an
people
like
the
germans
strutting
all
over
us
it
a
very
laudable
object
and
needs
no
camouflage
sheer
potterism
all
this
cant
and
posturing
i
rather
say
like
the
that
we
fighting
to
capture
the
trade
that
a
lie
but
at
least
it
is
cant
them
talk
said
juke
lazily
them
jabber
and
cant
what
does
it
matter
we
in
this
thing
up
to
the
neck
and
every
one
got
to
relieve
themselves
in
their
own
way
as
long
as
we
get
the
job
done
somehow
a
little
more
or
less
wo
make
much
difference
to
this
mighty
empire
which
has
always
indulged
in
plenty
it
the
rash
coming
out
good
for
the
system
so
each
individual
in
his
own
way
the
nation
entered
into
the
worst
period
of
time
of
which
europe
has
so
far
had
experience
and
on
which
i
do
not
propose
to
dwell
in
these
pages
except
in
its
aspect
of
a
source
of
profit
to
those
who
sought
profit
its
more
cheerful
aspect
in
fact
potter
put
away
the
writing
of
fiction
as
unsuitable
in
these
dark
days
it
may
be
remembered
that
there
was
a
period
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
when
it
was
erroneously
supposed
that
fiction
would
not
sell
until
peace
returned
potter
like
many
other
writers
took
up
canteen
work
and
went
for
a
time
to
france
there
she
wrote
an
account
of
the
work
of
herself
and
her
colleagues
in
rouen
full
of
the
inimitable
wit
and
indomitable
courage
of
soldiers
the
untiring
activities
of
canteen
workers
and
the
affectionate
which
existed
between
these
two
classes
the
world
was
thus
shown
that
leila
yorke
was
no
mere
of
letters
but
an
englishwoman
who
rose
to
her
country
call
and
was
worthy
of
her
clare
became
a
and
went
up
to
town
every
day
to
work
at
an
officers
hospital
it
was
a
hospital
maintained
partly
by
potter
and
she
got
on
very
well
there
she
made
many
pleasant
friends
and
hoped
to
get
out
to
france
later
frank
tried
for
a
chaplaincy
is
a
bit
that
he
wants
excitement
or
change
of
air
or
a
free
trip
to
france
or
to
feel
grand
like
some
of
them
do
explained
frank
what
the
good
of
keeping
a
man
like
him
slaving
away
in
a
rotten
parish
like
ours
when
they
want
good
men
out
there
i
tell
frank
all
he
got
to
do
to
get
round
the
is
to
grow
a
moustache
and
learn
up
the
correct
answers
to
a
few
questions
like
what
would
you
do
if
you
had
to
attend
a
dying
soldier
answer
offer
to
write
home
for
him
a
lot
of
parsons
do
know
that
and
go
telling
the
they
give
him
communion
or
hear
his
confession
or
something
and
that
knocks
them
out
first
round
frank
knows
better
there
are
no
flies
on
old
frank
all
the
same
pater
you
might
do
a
little
private
for
him
if
it
comes
in
handy
but
unfortunately
owing
to
a
recent
though
quite
temporary
coldness
between
the
and
the
potter
press
was
ineffectual
the
did
not
entertain
frank
offer
favourably
and
regretted
that
his
appointment
as
chaplain
to
his
majesty
forces
was
at
present
impracticable
so
frank
went
on
in
pimlico
and
was
cynical
and
bitter
about
those
clergymen
who
succeeded
in
passing
the
tests
do
you
join
up
as
a
combatant
johnny
asked
him
seeing
his
discontent
parsons
do
bishops
have
forbidden
it
said
frank
well
i
suppose
so
does
it
matter
particularly
dear
johnny
there
is
discipline
in
the
church
as
well
as
in
the
army
you
know
you
might
as
well
ask
would
it
matter
if
you
were
to
disobey
superior
officers
you
see
i
have
something
happen
to
me
if
i
did
parsons
do
you
only
be
reprimanded
i
suppose
and
get
into
a
berth
all
right
when
you
came
back
if
you
did
come
back
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
church
would
never
hold
together
if
her
officers
were
to
break
the
rules
whenever
they
felt
like
it
that
friend
of
yours
juke
has
a
leg
to
stand
on
he
merely
in
revolt
old
juke
always
is
of
course
against
every
kind
of
authority
but
particularly
against
bishops
he
always
got
his
knife
into
them
and
i
dare
say
he
glad
of
the
chance
of
flouting
them
high
church
parsons
are
are
they
i
expect
if
you
were
a
bit
higher
you
flout
them
too
and
if
you
were
a
bit
lower
the
take
you
as
a
padre
you
just
the
wrong
height
old
thing
that
what
the
matter
thus
johnny
now
a
stocky
lieutenant
on
leave
from
france
diagnosed
his
brother
case
wrongly
because
high
church
parsons
actually
enlisting
any
more
than
any
other
kind
they
did
not
mostly
believe
it
to
be
their
business
quite
sincerely
and
honestly
they
thought
it
would
be
wrong
for
them
though
right
for
laymen
to
undertake
combatant
service
anyhow
as
to
height
frank
knew
himself
to
be
of
a
height
acceptable
in
benefices
and
that
was
something
besides
it
was
his
own
height
i
ca
change
to
oblige
you
old
man
he
said
desert
my
post
and
pretend
to
be
a
layman
i
am
a
man
under
authority
like
you
i
wish
the
powers
that
be
would
send
me
out
there
but
it
for
them
to
judge
and
if
they
think
i
should
be
of
less
use
as
a
padre
than
all
the
toms
dicks
and
harrys
they
are
sending
it
not
for
me
to
protest
they
may
be
right
i
may
be
absolutely
useless
as
a
chaplain
on
the
other
hand
i
may
not
they
apparently
do
intend
to
give
themselves
a
chance
of
finding
out
very
well
it
nothing
to
me
either
way
that
all
right
then
johnny
said
no
one
could
say
that
the
potter
press
did
not
rise
to
the
great
opportunity
the
press
seldom
fails
to
do
this
the
potter
press
surpassed
itself
it
nearly
surpassed
its
great
rival
presses
with
energy
and
it
cheered
comforted
and
stimulated
the
people
it
never
failed
to
say
how
well
the
allies
were
getting
on
how
much
ammunition
they
had
how
many
men
what
indomitable
tenacity
and
cheerful
spirits
enlivened
the
trenches
the
correspondents
it
employed
wrote
home
rejoicing
its
leading
articles
were
noble
hymns
of
praise
in
times
of
darkness
and
travail
one
can
not
but
be
glad
of
such
a
press
as
this
so
glad
were
the
government
of
it
that
potter
became
at
the
end
of
lord
pinkerton
and
his
press
the
pinkerton
press
of
course
that
was
not
the
only
reward
he
obtained
for
his
services
he
figured
every
new
year
in
the
honours
list
and
collected
in
succession
most
of
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
after
his
name
with
it
all
he
remained
the
same
alert
inconspicuous
person
with
the
same
unswerving
belief
in
his
own
methods
and
his
own
destinies
a
belief
which
never
passed
from
to
unless
you
were
so
determined
a
hater
of
potterism
as
to
be
blindly
prejudiced
you
could
not
help
liking
lord
pinkerton
jane
sulking
because
she
could
not
fight
thought
for
a
short
time
that
she
would
nurse
and
get
abroad
that
way
then
it
became
obvious
that
too
many
fools
were
scrambling
to
get
sent
abroad
and
anyhow
that
if
clare
was
nursing
it
must
be
a
mug
game
and
that
there
must
be
a
better
field
for
her
own
energies
elsewhere
with
so
many
men
going
there
would
be
empty
places
to
fill
that
thought
came
perhaps
as
soon
to
jane
as
to
any
one
in
the
country
her
father
lady
secretary
went
nursing
and
lord
pinkerton
well
aware
of
his
younger
daughter
clearheaded
competence
offered
jane
the
job
at
a
larger
salary
shorthand
would
soon
come
back
if
you
took
it
up
he
told
her
for
he
had
had
all
his
children
taught
shorthand
at
a
young
age
in
his
view
it
was
one
of
the
essentials
of
education
he
had
learned
it
himself
at
the
age
of
thirteen
and
insulted
his
superior
young
gentlemen
private
secretaries
by
asking
them
if
they
knew
it
jane
and
johnny
who
had
been
in
early
youth
very
proficient
at
it
had
since
they
were
old
enough
to
know
it
was
a
sort
of
low
commercial
cunning
the
accomplishment
of
the
slave
hidden
their
knowledge
away
like
a
vice
when
concealed
from
observation
and
pressed
for
time
they
had
furtively
taken
down
lecture
notes
in
it
at
oxford
but
always
with
a
consciousness
of
guilt
jane
had
declined
the
secretaryship
she
did
not
mean
to
be
that
sort
of
low
secretary
that
takes
down
letters
she
did
not
mean
to
work
for
the
potter
press
and
she
thought
it
would
be
needlessly
dull
to
work
for
her
father
she
said
thank
you
dad
i
thinking
of
the
civil
service
that
was
early
in
when
women
had
only
just
begun
to
think
of
or
be
thought
of
by
the
civil
service
jane
did
not
think
of
it
with
enthusiasm
she
wanted
to
be
a
journalist
and
to
write
but
it
would
do
for
the
time
and
would
probably
be
amusing
so
owing
to
the
helpful
influence
of
potter
and
a
good
degree
jane
obtained
a
quite
good
post
at
the
admiralty
which
she
had
to
swear
never
to
mention
and
went
into
rooms
in
a
square
off
fleet
street
with
katherine
varick
who
had
a
research
fellowship
in
chemistry
and
worked
in
a
laboratory
in
farringdon
street
the
admiralty
was
all
right
it
was
interesting
as
such
jobs
go
and
jane
who
was
did
it
well
she
got
to
know
a
few
men
and
women
who
she
considered
were
worth
knowing
though
in
technical
departments
such
as
the
admiralty
the
men
were
apt
to
be
superior
to
the
women
the
women
jane
met
there
were
mostly
clerks
and
so
forth
nice
cheery
young
things
but
rather
stupid
who
thought
it
jolly
for
jane
to
be
connected
with
leila
yorke
and
the
potter
press
and
were
scarcely
worth
undeceiving
and
naval
officers
though
charming
were
apt
to
be
a
little
elementary
jane
discovered
in
their
general
outlook
however
the
job
was
all
right
not
a
bad
plum
to
have
picked
out
of
the
hash
on
the
whole
and
the
life
was
all
right
the
rooms
were
jolly
only
the
new
geyser
exploded
too
often
and
katherine
varick
though
she
made
stinks
in
the
evenings
not
bad
to
live
with
and
money
not
too
scarce
as
money
goes
and
theatres
and
dinners
frequent
doing
bit
putting
one
shoulder
to
the
wheel
proving
the
mettle
of
the
women
of
england
certainly
had
its
agreeable
side
in
intervals
of
office
work
and
social
life
jane
was
writing
odds
and
ends
and
planning
the
books
she
meant
to
write
after
the
war
she
had
settled
her
line
yet
articles
on
social
and
industrial
questions
for
the
papers
she
hoped
for
one
thing
she
had
plenty
to
say
on
this
head
short
stories
poems
then
perhaps
a
novel
about
the
nature
of
the
novel
jane
was
undecided
except
that
it
would
be
more
unlike
the
novels
of
leila
yorke
than
any
novels
had
ever
been
before
perhaps
a
sarcastic
rather
cynical
novel
about
human
nature
of
which
jane
did
not
think
much
perhaps
a
serious
novel
dealing
with
social
or
political
conditions
perhaps
an
impressionist
novel
like
dorothy
richardson
only
they
were
getting
common
they
were
too
easy
one
could
hardly
help
writing
like
that
unless
one
tried
not
to
if
one
had
lately
read
any
of
them
most
contemporary
novels
jane
found
very
bad
not
worth
writing
those
solemn
and
childish
novels
about
public
schools
for
instance
written
by
young
men
jane
wondered
what
a
novel
about
roedean
or
wycombe
abbey
would
be
like
the
queer
thing
was
that
some
young
woman
did
write
one
it
need
be
no
duller
than
the
young
men
rather
duller
perhaps
because
schoolgirls
were
more
childish
than
schoolboys
the
problems
of
their
upbringing
less
portentous
but
there
were
many
of
the
same
ingredients
the
exaltation
of
games
rows
the
clever
new
literary
mistress
who
made
all
the
other
mistresses
angry
only
were
the
other
mistresses
at
girls
schools
no
jane
thought
not
quite
a
decent
modern
set
on
the
whole
for
people
of
their
age
better
than
schoolmasters
they
must
be
how
dull
it
all
was
some
woman
ought
to
do
it
but
not
jane
jane
was
inclined
in
her
present
phase
to
think
the
russians
and
the
french
the
only
novelists
they
had
manner
and
method
but
they
were
both
too
limited
in
their
field
too
much
concerned
with
sexual
relations
that
most
tedious
of
topics
in
literature
not
life
the
very
thought
of
which
made
one
yawn
queer
thing
how
novelists
could
leave
it
alone
it
was
surely
like
eating
and
drinking
a
natural
element
in
life
which
few
avoid
but
the
most
exciting
jolly
interesting
entertaining
things
were
apart
from
it
not
that
jane
was
not
quite
willing
to
accept
with
approval
as
part
of
the
game
of
living
such
episodes
in
this
field
as
came
her
way
but
she
could
not
regard
them
as
important
as
to
marriage
it
was
merely
dowdy
domesticity
babies
servants
the
companionship
of
one
man
the
sort
of
thing
clare
would
go
in
for
no
doubt
not
for
jane
before
whom
the
world
lay
an
oyster
asking
to
be
opened
she
saw
herself
a
journalist
a
reporter
perhaps
only
the
stories
women
were
sent
out
on
were
usually
dull
a
special
correspondent
a
contributor
a
leader
writer
eventually
an
editor
then
she
could
initiate
a
policy
say
what
she
thought
stand
up
against
the
potter
press
or
one
might
be
a
public
speaker
and
get
into
parliament
later
on
when
women
were
admitted
one
despised
parliament
but
it
might
be
fun
not
a
permanent
civil
servant
one
could
not
work
for
this
ludicrous
government
more
than
temporarily
to
tide
over
the
great
interruption
so
jane
looked
with
calm
weighing
critical
eyes
at
life
and
its
chances
and
saw
that
they
were
not
bad
for
such
as
her
unless
of
course
the
allies
were
beaten
this
contingency
seemed
often
possible
even
probable
jane
faith
in
the
ultimate
winning
power
of
numbers
and
wealth
was
at
times
shaken
not
by
the
blunders
of
governments
or
the
defection
of
valuable
allies
but
by
the
unwavering
optimism
of
her
parent
press
said
katherine
varick
usually
right
your
papa
press
that
the
queer
thing
about
it
it
sounds
always
wildly
wrong
like
an
absurd
fairy
story
and
all
the
sane
intelligent
people
laugh
at
it
and
then
it
turns
out
to
have
been
right
look
at
the
way
it
used
to
say
that
germany
was
planning
war
it
was
mostly
the
stupid
people
who
believed
it
and
the
intelligent
people
who
did
but
all
the
time
germany
was
because
people
like
daddy
kept
saying
so
and
planning
to
get
in
first
much
germany
was
really
planning
we
were
only
talking
i
believe
in
the
pinkerton
press
and
the
other
absurd
presses
they
have
the
unthinking
rightness
of
the
fool
of
course
they
have
because
the
happenings
of
the
world
are
caused
by
people
the
mass
of
people
and
the
pinkerton
press
knows
them
and
represents
them
intellectual
people
are
always
thinking
above
the
heads
of
the
people
who
make
movements
so
they
nearly
always
out
the
pinkerton
press
the
people
so
it
gets
there
every
time
potterism
will
outlive
all
the
reformers
and
idealists
if
potterism
says
we
going
to
have
a
war
we
have
it
if
it
says
we
going
to
win
a
war
we
shall
win
it
if
you
see
it
in
it
so
it
was
not
often
that
katherine
spoke
of
potterism
but
when
she
did
it
was
with
conviction
gideon
was
home
wounded
he
had
nearly
died
but
not
quite
he
had
lost
his
right
foot
and
would
have
another
when
the
time
was
ripe
he
was
discharged
and
became
later
on
assistant
editor
of
a
new
weekly
paper
that
was
started
he
dined
with
jane
and
katherine
at
their
flat
soon
after
he
could
get
about
he
was
leaner
than
ever
white
and
gaunt
and
often
from
pain
johnny
was
there
too
a
major
on
leave
stuck
over
with
coloured
ribbons
jane
called
him
a
they
laughed
and
talked
and
joked
and
dined
when
gideon
and
johnny
had
gone
and
katherine
and
jane
were
left
smoking
last
cigarettes
and
finishing
the
chocolates
jane
said
lazily
and
without
chagrin
arthur
does
hate
us
all
in
these
days
katherine
said
he
finds
us
profiteers
we
are
said
jane
you
but
most
of
us
i
am
you
one
of
the
few
people
he
respects
some
day
perhaps
you
have
to
marry
him
and
cure
him
of
biting
his
nails
when
he
cross
he
thinks
johnny
a
profiteer
too
because
of
the
ribbons
and
things
johnny
is
it
in
the
blood
we
grabbers
ca
be
helped
do
you
want
the
last
walnut
chocolate
old
thing
if
so
you
too
late
chapter
iv
jane
and
clare
in
the
autumn
of
jane
when
she
went
home
for
frequently
found
one
oliver
hobart
there
oliver
hobart
was
the
new
editor
of
lord
pinkerton
chief
daily
paper
and
had
been
exempted
from
military
service
as
newspaper
staff
he
was
a
canadian
he
had
been
educated
at
mcgill
university
admired
lord
pinkerton
his
press
and
the
british
empire
and
despised
in
this
order
the
quebec
french
the
roman
catholic
church
newspapers
which
did
not
succeed
little
englanders
and
lord
lansdowne
really
beautiful
face
said
lady
pinkerton
and
so
he
had
jane
had
seen
it
from
time
to
time
during
the
last
year
when
she
had
called
to
see
her
father
in
the
office
of
the
one
hot
saturday
afternoon
in
august
she
found
him
having
tea
with
her
family
in
the
shadow
of
the
biggest
elm
jane
looked
at
them
in
her
detached
way
lord
pinkerton
neat
and
little
his
feet
crossed
his
head
cocked
to
one
side
like
an
intelligent
sparrow
lady
pinkerton
tall
and
fair
and
powdered
in
a
lilac
silk
dress
her
large
white
hands
all
over
rings
amethysts
swinging
from
her
ears
clare
who
had
given
up
nursing
owing
to
the
strain
and
was
having
a
rest
slim
and
rather
graceful
a
little
flushed
from
the
heat
lying
in
a
deck
chair
and
swinging
a
buckled
shoe
saying
something
ordinary
and
hobart
sitting
by
her
a
pale
gibson
young
man
with
his
smooth
fair
hair
brushed
back
and
lavender
socks
with
purple
clocks
and
a
clear
firm
jaw
he
was
listening
to
clare
with
a
smile
you
could
not
help
liking
him
his
was
the
sort
of
beauty
which
when
found
in
either
man
or
woman
makes
so
strong
an
appeal
to
the
senses
of
the
sex
other
than
that
of
the
possessor
that
reason
is
all
but
swamped
besides
as
lord
pinkerton
said
hobart
was
a
dear
nice
fellow
he
was
at
sherards
for
that
because
lord
pinkerton
was
just
making
him
editor
of
the
before
that
he
had
been
on
the
staff
a
departmental
editor
and
a
hobart
will
go
far
said
lady
pinkerton
sometimes
when
she
read
the
leaders
hope
on
the
contrary
said
lord
pinkerton
he
will
stay
where
he
is
it
is
precisely
the
right
spot
that
was
the
trouble
with
carruthers
he
went
too
far
so
he
had
to
go
altogether
he
gave
his
thin
little
snigger
anyhow
here
was
hobart
this
saturday
afternoon
having
tea
in
the
garden
jane
saw
him
through
the
mellow
golden
sweetness
of
shadow
and
light
is
jane
said
lady
pinkerton
jane
dark
hair
fell
in
damp
waves
over
her
hot
square
white
forehead
her
blue
cotton
dress
was
crumpled
and
limp
how
neat
how
cool
was
this
hobart
could
a
man
have
a
gibson
face
like
that
like
a
young
man
on
the
cover
of
an
illustrated
magazine
and
not
be
a
ninny
did
he
take
the
pinkerton
press
seriously
or
did
he
laugh
both
probably
like
most
journalists
he
would
laugh
to
lord
pinkerton
or
to
lady
pinkerton
or
to
clare
but
he
might
laugh
to
jane
when
she
showed
him
he
might
jane
eating
jam
sandwiches
looking
like
a
chubby
school
child
with
her
round
face
and
wide
eyes
and
bobbed
hair
and
cotton
frock
watched
the
beautiful
young
man
with
her
solemn
unwinking
stare
that
disconcerted
people
while
lady
pinkerton
talked
to
him
about
some
recent
fiction
on
sunday
people
came
over
to
lunch
and
they
played
tennis
clare
and
hobart
played
together
well
up
partner
jane
could
hear
him
say
all
the
time
or
else
it
was
tried
too
bad
clare
happy
eyes
shone
brown
and
clear
in
her
flushed
face
like
agates
rather
a
pretty
thing
clare
if
dull
the
franks
were
there
too
clare
having
a
good
time
said
frank
to
jane
during
a
set
they
were
playing
in
her
merry
dark
eyes
snapped
instinctively
she
usually
said
something
to
disparage
the
good
time
of
other
girls
this
time
it
was
hobart
thinks
he
doing
himself
a
good
turn
with
pater
making
up
to
clare
like
that
oh
he
a
cunning
fellow
is
he
handsome
jane
i
hate
these
handsome
fellows
they
always
know
it
so
well
nothing
in
his
face
really
if
you
come
to
look
is
there
rather
have
old
frank
even
if
he
does
look
like
a
bird
jane
was
calmly
rude
to
hobart
showing
him
she
despised
his
paper
and
him
for
editing
it
she
let
him
see
it
all
and
he
was
imperturbably
courteously
amused
and
in
turn
showed
that
he
despised
her
for
belonging
to
the
club
do
he
said
turning
to
clare
no
i
do
belong
to
a
club
at
all
i
go
with
mother
to
the
writers
sometimes
though
that
not
bad
fun
mother
often
speaks
there
you
know
and
i
go
and
hear
jolly
good
she
is
too
she
read
a
ripping
paper
last
week
on
the
modern
heroine
jane
considering
eyes
weighed
hobart
whose
courtesy
was
still
impregnable
how
far
was
he
the
complete
potterite
identified
with
his
absurd
press
did
he
even
appreciate
leila
yorke
she
would
have
liked
to
know
but
it
seemed
she
was
not
to
know
from
him
the
armistice
came
then
the
thing
was
to
get
to
paris
somehow
jane
had
unusually
not
played
her
cards
well
she
had
neglected
the
prospect
of
peace
which
after
all
must
come
when
she
had
in
may
at
last
taken
thought
for
the
morrow
and
applied
at
the
foreign
office
for
one
of
those
secret
jobs
which
could
not
be
mentioned
because
they
prepared
the
doers
to
play
their
parts
after
the
great
unmentionable
event
she
was
too
late
the
foreign
office
said
they
could
not
take
over
people
from
other
government
departments
so
when
the
unmentionable
took
place
jane
was
badly
left
the
foreign
office
library
department
people
many
of
them
jane
contemporaries
at
oxford
and
cambridge
were
hurried
across
the
channel
into
life
for
which
they
had
been
prepared
by
a
course
of
lectures
on
the
dangers
of
paris
there
also
went
the
confidential
secretaries
the
clerks
and
shorthand
typists
in
their
hundreds
degreeless
brainless
beings
but
wise
in
their
generation
wish
i
was
a
shorthand
typist
jane
grumbled
brooding
with
katherine
over
their
fire
katherine
turned
over
the
delightful
word
consideringly
finding
it
wanting
last
place
in
the
world
i
should
choose
to
be
in
just
now
fuss
and
foolishness
greed
and
grabbing
the
centre
of
the
lunacies
and
crimes
of
the
next
six
months
politicians
assembled
together
it
infinitely
common
to
go
there
all
the
vulgarest
people
you
be
more
select
at
southend
or
blackpool
is
being
made
there
said
jane
quoting
from
her
father
press
you
i
rather
go
to
birmingham
and
make
something
clean
and
useful
like
glass
but
jane
wanted
to
make
history
in
paris
she
felt
out
of
it
left
as
she
had
felt
when
other
people
went
to
the
war
and
she
stayed
at
home
on
a
yellow
foggy
day
just
before
christmas
lord
pinkerton
with
whom
jane
was
lunching
at
his
club
lord
pinkerton
was
quite
good
to
lunch
with
you
got
a
splendid
feed
for
nothing
said
shall
be
going
over
to
paris
next
month
babs
that
was
what
he
called
her
want
to
come
i
should
say
so
do
rub
it
in
dad
lord
pinkerton
looked
at
her
with
his
whimsical
affectionate
paternity
can
come
if
you
like
babs
i
want
another
secretary
must
have
one
if
you
do
some
of
the
shorthand
typing
and
filing
you
can
come
along
how
about
it
jane
thought
for
exactly
thirty
seconds
weighing
the
shorthand
typing
against
paris
and
the
majestic
and
life
life
had
it
as
usual
daddy
i
come
along
when
do
we
go
over
that
afternoon
jane
gave
notice
to
her
department
and
in
the
middle
of
january
lord
pinkerton
and
his
bodyguard
of
secretaries
and
assistants
went
to
paris
that
was
life
trousseaux
concerts
jazzing
dinners
marble
bathrooms
notorious
persons
as
thick
as
thieves
in
corridors
and
on
the
stairs
dangers
of
paris
surging
outside
disappointed
journalists
besieging
proud
politicians
in
vain
the
council
of
four
sitting
in
perfect
harmony
behind
thick
curtains
signor
orlando
refusing
to
play
but
finding
they
went
on
playing
without
him
and
coming
back
walking
about
under
the
aegis
of
wickham
steed
smiling
sweetly
and
triumphantly
at
the
italians
going
to
the
theatre
and
coming
out
because
the
jokes
seemed
to
them
dubious
sir
george
riddell
and
mair
desperately
controlling
the
press
lord
pinkerton
flying
to
and
fro
across
the
channel
and
back
again
while
his
bodyguard
remained
in
paris
there
also
flew
to
and
fro
oliver
hobart
the
editor
of
the
he
would
drop
in
on
jane
sitting
in
her
father
outer
office
opening
and
entering
letters
and
what
not
miss
potter
lord
pinkerton
in
the
office
this
morning
in
the
building
somewhere
talking
to
sir
george
i
think
did
you
fly
this
time
whether
he
had
flown
or
whether
he
had
come
by
train
and
boat
he
always
looked
the
same
calm
unruffled
tidy
the
exquisite
nut
busy
he
would
say
with
his
smile
at
the
lazy
drawling
child
who
was
so
sometimes
so
impudent
often
so
sarcastic
always
so
amusingly
different
from
her
slim
pretty
and
girlish
elder
sister
well
jane
would
reply
do
overwork
though
do
believe
you
do
hobart
said
looking
down
at
her
amusedly
does
though
that
why
he
thin
and
i
fat
what
the
use
it
makes
no
difference
getting
reconciled
then
said
hobart
working
for
the
pinkerton
press
jane
secretly
approved
his
discernment
but
all
she
said
was
with
her
cool
lack
of
stress
not
so
bad
usually
when
hobart
was
in
paris
he
would
dine
with
them
lady
pinkerton
and
clare
came
over
for
a
week
they
stayed
in
rooms
in
the
avenue
de
they
visited
shops
theatres
and
friends
and
lady
pinkerton
began
a
novel
about
paris
life
clare
had
been
run
down
and
and
the
doctor
had
suggested
a
change
of
scene
hobart
was
in
paris
for
the
he
dined
with
the
pinkertons
and
went
to
the
theatre
with
them
but
on
monday
he
had
to
go
back
to
london
on
monday
morning
clare
came
to
her
father
office
and
found
jane
taking
down
letters
from
lord
pinkerton
private
secretary
a
young
man
who
had
been
exempted
from
military
service
through
the
war
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
lord
pinkerton
right
hand
clare
sat
and
waited
and
looked
round
the
room
for
violets
while
this
young
gentleman
dictated
his
letters
were
better
worded
than
lord
pinkerton
because
he
was
better
at
the
english
language
lord
pinkerton
would
fall
into
commercialisms
he
would
say
and
and
hand
and
even
sometimes
favour
of
the
his
secretary
knew
that
that
was
not
the
way
in
which
a
great
newspaper
chief
should
write
himself
he
dictated
quite
a
good
letter
but
annoyed
jane
by
putting
in
the
punctuation
as
if
she
was
an
imbecile
thus
he
was
saying
now
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
plunged
in
thought
pinkerton
is
not
comma
however
comma
averse
to
jane
wrote
your
suggestions
comma
and
will
be
glad
if
you
can
make
it
convenient
to
call
bracket
tuesday
close
the
bracket
afternoon
comma
between
three
and
five
stop
he
could
not
help
it
one
must
make
allowances
for
those
who
dictate
but
clare
saw
jane
teeth
release
her
clenched
tongue
to
permit
it
to
form
silently
the
word
the
private
secretary
retired
into
his
chief
inner
sanctum
old
thing
said
jane
to
clare
uncovering
her
typewriter
without
haste
and
yawning
because
she
had
been
up
late
last
night
clare
yawned
too
she
was
warm
and
pretty
in
a
spring
costume
with
a
big
bunch
of
sweet
violets
at
her
waist
she
touched
these
they
hobart
left
them
this
morning
before
he
went
jolly
decent
of
him
to
think
of
it
getting
off
in
a
hurry
like
he
was
he
not
a
bad
young
thing
do
you
think
so
bad
jane
extracted
carbons
from
a
drawer
and
fitted
them
to
her
paper
then
she
stretched
like
a
cat
i
sleepy
do
feel
like
work
for
two
pins
i
cut
it
and
go
out
with
you
and
mother
the
sun
shining
is
it
clare
stood
by
the
window
and
swung
the
they
had
five
days
of
paris
before
them
and
paris
suddenly
seemed
empty
going
to
have
a
topping
week
she
said
then
lord
pinkerton
came
in
gone
he
asked
jane
in
my
room
lord
pinkerton
patted
clare
shoulder
as
he
passed
her
miss
hope
in
to
me
when
she
comes
babs
he
said
and
disappeared
through
the
farther
door
jane
began
to
type
it
bored
her
but
she
was
fairly
proficient
at
it
her
childhood
training
stood
her
in
good
stead
hobart
must
have
run
his
train
pretty
fine
if
he
came
in
here
on
the
way
said
clare
twirling
the
was
going
till
twelve
said
jane
typing
i
see
i
thought
it
was
ten
i
suppose
he
found
he
could
get
that
one
and
had
to
see
dad
first
what
a
bore
for
him
well
i
off
to
meet
mother
see
you
this
evening
i
suppose
clare
went
out
into
paris
and
the
march
sunshine
whistling
softly
that
night
she
lay
awake
in
her
big
bed
as
she
had
lain
last
night
she
lay
tense
and
still
and
stared
at
the
great
gas
globe
that
looked
in
through
the
open
window
from
the
street
her
brain
formed
phrases
and
pictures
day
on
the
river
those
sundays
that
lunch
at
the
florence
what
attractive
shoes
those
my
gray
suedes
i
had
i
love
these
sunday
you
one
of
the
few
girls
who
are
jolly
to
watch
when
they
just
you
and
me
would
it
be
rather
nice
i
should
like
it
he
kept
looking
whenever
i
looked
up
he
was
looking
his
eyes
awfully
blue
with
black
edges
to
them
peggy
said
he
blacked
them
peggy
was
jealous
because
he
never
looked
at
her
i
jealous
now
because
no
i
not
why
should
i
be
he
does
like
fat
girls
he
said
he
watches
her
he
looks
at
her
when
there
a
joke
he
bought
me
violets
but
he
went
to
see
her
he
keeps
coming
over
to
paris
i
never
see
him
i
do
get
a
chance
he
cared
he
did
care
he
forgetting
because
i
do
get
a
chance
she
stealing
him
she
was
always
a
selfish
little
cad
grabbing
and
not
really
caring
she
ca
care
as
i
do
she
not
made
that
way
she
cares
for
nothing
but
herself
she
gets
everything
just
by
sitting
still
and
not
bothering
college
makes
girls
awful
peggy
says
men
like
them
but
they
do
they
seem
not
to
care
about
men
but
they
care
just
the
same
they
do
bother
but
they
get
what
they
want
pig
oh
i
ca
bear
it
why
should
i
i
love
him
i
love
him
i
love
him
oh
i
must
go
to
sleep
i
shall
go
mad
if
i
have
another
night
like
last
night
clare
got
out
of
bed
stumbled
to
the
washstand
splashed
her
burning
head
and
face
with
cold
water
then
lay
shivering
it
may
or
may
not
be
true
that
the
power
to
love
is
to
be
found
in
the
human
being
in
inverse
ratio
to
the
power
to
think
probably
it
is
not
these
generalisations
seldom
are
anyhow
clare
like
many
others
could
not
understand
but
loved
lady
pinkerton
said
to
her
lord
next
day
much
longer
will
the
peace
take
being
made
percy
dear
i
ca
tell
you
even
i
do
know
everything
there
are
many
little
difficulties
which
have
to
be
smoothed
down
allies
stand
in
a
curious
and
not
altogether
easy
relation
to
one
another
of
course
not
only
italy
dearest
course
china
is
being
very
tiresome
if
it
were
only
china
lady
pinkerton
sighed
it
is
all
very
sad
i
do
hope
percy
that
after
this
war
we
english
will
never
again
forget
that
we
hate
foreigners
hope
not
my
dear
i
am
afraid
before
the
war
i
was
largely
responsible
for
encouraging
these
fraternisations
and
discriminations
a
mistake
no
doubt
but
one
which
did
credit
to
our
hearts
one
must
always
remember
about
a
great
people
like
ourselves
that
the
heart
leads
god
for
that
said
leila
yorke
illogically
then
lady
pinkerton
added
this
peace
takes
too
long
i
suppose
a
lasting
and
righteous
peace
must
shall
you
have
to
be
running
to
and
fro
like
this
till
it
signed
dear
and
fro
yes
i
must
keep
an
office
going
here
is
enjoying
it
said
lady
pinkerton
sees
a
lot
of
oliver
hobart
i
suppose
does
she
in
and
out
of
course
he
and
the
child
get
on
better
than
they
used
to
is
no
doubt
about
that
said
lady
pinkerton
you
do
know
it
percy
i
had
better
tell
you
men
never
see
these
things
he
is
falling
in
love
with
her
lord
pinkerton
fidgeted
about
the
room
rilly
very
amusing
you
used
to
think
it
was
clare
dearest
he
cocked
his
head
at
her
accusingly
convicting
her
of
being
a
woman
of
fancies
you
dear
novelists
he
said
and
shook
a
finger
at
her
percy
it
is
perfectly
obvious
he
used
to
be
attracted
by
clare
and
now
he
is
attracted
by
jane
very
strange
such
different
types
but
life
strange
and
particularly
love
oh
i
do
say
love
yet
but
it
a
strong
attraction
and
may
easily
lead
to
it
the
question
is
are
we
to
let
it
go
on
or
shall
we
head
him
back
to
clare
who
has
begun
to
care
i
am
afraid
poor
child
head
him
back
if
you
like
and
can
darling
i
do
suppose
babs
wants
him
anyhow
is
just
it
if
jane
did
i
should
interfere
her
happiness
is
as
dear
to
me
as
clare
naturally
but
jane
is
not
susceptible
she
has
a
colder
temperament
and
she
is
often
quite
rude
to
oliver
hobart
look
how
different
their
views
about
everything
are
he
and
clare
agree
much
better
well
mother
you
the
doctor
i
do
my
best
not
to
throw
them
together
when
next
hobart
comes
over
but
we
must
leave
the
children
to
settle
their
affairs
for
themselves
if
he
really
wants
fat
little
babs
we
ca
stop
him
trying
for
her
is
difficult
lady
pinkerton
sighed
poor
little
clare
is
looking
like
a
wilted
flower
little
girl
m
yes
poor
little
girl
well
well
we
see
what
can
be
done
i
see
if
i
can
take
janet
home
for
a
bit
perhaps
get
her
out
of
the
way
she
very
useful
to
me
here
though
there
are
no
flies
on
jane
she
got
the
potter
wits
all
right
but
lady
pinkerton
loved
better
clare
who
was
like
a
flower
clare
whom
she
had
created
clare
who
might
have
come
if
any
girl
could
have
come
out
of
a
leila
yorke
novel
shall
say
a
word
to
jane
lady
pinkerton
decided
to
sound
her
but
after
all
it
was
jane
who
said
the
word
she
said
it
that
evening
in
her
cool
leisurely
way
hobart
asked
me
to
marry
him
yesterday
morning
i
wrote
to
tell
him
i
would
i
append
now
the
personal
records
of
various
people
concerned
in
this
story
it
seems
the
best
way
part
ii
told
by
gideon
chapter
i
spinning
nothing
that
i
or
anybody
else
did
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
was
of
the
slightest
importance
it
ought
to
have
been
a
time
for
great
enterprises
and
beginnings
but
it
emphatically
was
it
was
a
queer
inconclusive
lazy
muddled
reckless
unsatisfactory
rather
ludicrous
time
it
seemed
as
if
the
world
was
suffering
from
vertigo
i
have
seen
men
who
have
been
badly
hit
spinning
round
and
round
madly
like
dancing
dervishes
that
was
i
think
what
we
were
all
doing
for
some
time
after
the
war
spinning
round
and
round
silly
and
dazed
without
purpose
or
power
at
least
the
only
purpose
in
evidence
was
the
fierce
quest
of
enjoyment
and
the
only
power
that
of
successfully
shirking
facts
we
were
like
bankrupts
who
can
not
summon
energy
to
begin
life
and
work
again
in
earnest
and
we
were
represented
by
the
most
comic
parliament
that
ever
sat
in
westminster
upon
which
it
would
be
too
painful
here
to
expatiate
one
did
know
what
had
happened
or
what
was
happening
or
what
was
going
to
happen
we
had
won
the
war
but
what
was
that
going
to
mean
what
were
we
going
to
get
out
of
it
what
did
we
want
the
new
world
to
be
what
did
we
want
this
country
to
be
every
one
shouted
a
different
answer
the
december
elections
seemed
to
give
one
answer
but
i
think
it
was
a
true
one
the
public
did
really
want
the
england
of
and
pemberton
billing
they
showed
that
later
a
good
many
people
of
course
wanted
and
want
revolution
and
the
international
i
do
and
never
did
i
hate
and
all
other
flaggery
the
sentimentalism
of
bob
smillie
is
as
bad
as
the
sentimentalism
of
the
pinkerton
press
as
untruthful
as
greedy
as
smillie
lot
are
out
to
get
and
the
potterites
out
to
keep
the
is
more
excusable
in
its
aims
but
its
methods
any
more
attractive
juke
can
swallow
it
all
but
jukie
has
let
his
naturally
clear
head
get
muddled
by
a
mediaeval
form
of
religion
religion
is
like
love
it
plays
the
devil
with
clear
thinking
juke
pretended
not
to
hate
even
smillie
interview
with
the
coal
dukes
he
applauded
when
smillie
quoted
texts
at
them
though
i
know
of
course
that
that
sort
of
thing
is
mainly
a
pose
on
juke
part
because
it
amuses
him
besides
one
of
the
dukes
was
a
cousin
of
his
who
bored
him
so
of
course
he
was
pleased
but
those
texts
damned
smillie
for
ever
in
my
eyes
he
had
those
poor
imbeciles
at
his
mercy
and
he
gave
his
whole
case
away
by
quoting
irrelevant
remarks
from
ancient
hebrew
writers
i
wish
i
had
had
his
chance
for
ten
minutes
i
would
have
taken
it
but
the
labour
people
are
always
giving
themselves
away
with
both
hands
to
the
enemy
i
suppose
facts
have
hit
them
too
hard
and
so
they
shrink
away
from
them
pad
them
with
sentiment
like
uneducated
women
in
villas
they
all
need
so
do
the
women
a
legal
training
to
make
their
minds
hard
and
clear
and
sharp
so
do
journalists
nearly
the
whole
press
is
the
same
dealing
in
emotions
and
stunts
unable
to
face
facts
squarely
in
a
calm
spirit
it
seemed
to
some
of
us
that
spring
that
there
was
a
chance
for
unsentimental
journalism
in
a
new
paper
that
should
be
unhampered
by
tradition
that
was
why
the
unofficially
called
the
was
started
all
the
other
papers
had
traditions
their
past
principles
dictated
their
future
policy
the
except
that
it
was
up
against
potterism
was
untrammelled
it
was
to
judge
of
each
issue
as
it
turned
up
on
its
own
merits
in
the
light
of
fact
that
of
course
was
in
itself
the
very
essence
of
which
was
incapable
of
judging
or
considering
anything
whatever
and
whose
only
light
was
a
feeble
emotionalism
the
light
of
fact
was
to
potterites
but
a
worse
darkness
the
was
to
be
labelled
liberal
or
labour
or
tory
or
democratic
or
or
anything
at
all
all
these
things
were
to
vary
with
the
immediate
occasions
i
know
it
sounds
like
lloyd
george
but
there
were
at
least
two
very
important
differences
between
the
and
the
prime
minister
one
was
that
the
employed
experts
who
always
made
a
very
thorough
and
scientific
investigation
of
every
subject
it
dealt
with
before
it
took
up
a
line
it
cared
for
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
the
other
was
that
the
took
in
nearly
every
case
the
less
popular
side
not
of
course
because
it
was
less
popular
for
to
do
that
would
have
been
one
of
the
general
principles
of
which
we
tried
to
steer
clear
but
it
so
happened
that
we
came
to
the
conclusion
nearly
always
that
the
majority
were
wrong
the
fact
is
that
majorities
nearly
always
are
the
heart
of
the
people
may
be
usually
in
the
right
place
though
personally
i
doubt
this
for
the
heart
of
man
is
corrupt
but
their
head
can
in
most
cases
be
relied
on
to
be
in
the
wrong
one
this
is
an
important
thing
for
statesmen
to
remember
forgetfulness
of
it
has
often
led
to
disaster
ignorance
of
it
has
created
potterism
as
an
official
faith
anyhow
the
again
unlike
the
prime
minister
could
afford
to
ignore
the
charges
of
flightiness
and
irresponsibility
which
of
course
were
flung
at
it
it
could
afford
to
ignore
them
because
of
the
good
and
solid
excellence
of
its
contents
and
the
reputations
of
many
of
its
contributors
and
that
of
course
was
due
to
the
fact
that
it
had
plenty
of
money
behind
it
a
great
many
people
know
who
backs
the
but
all
the
same
i
can
not
of
course
give
away
this
information
to
the
public
i
will
only
say
that
it
started
with
such
a
good
financial
backing
that
it
was
able
to
afford
the
best
work
able
even
to
afford
the
truth
most
of
the
good
weeklies
certainly
speak
the
truth
as
they
see
it
they
are
in
fact
a
very
creditable
section
of
our
press
but
the
idea
of
the
was
to
be
absolutely
unbiased
on
each
issue
that
turned
up
by
anything
it
had
ever
thought
before
of
course
you
may
say
that
a
man
will
be
likely
when
a
case
comes
before
his
eyes
to
come
to
the
same
conclusion
about
it
that
he
came
to
about
a
similar
case
not
long
before
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
surprising
how
some
slight
difference
in
the
circumstances
of
a
case
may
if
a
man
keeps
an
open
mind
alter
his
whole
judgment
of
it
the
was
a
scientific
not
a
sentimental
paper
if
our
investigations
led
us
into
autocracy
we
were
to
follow
them
there
if
to
a
soviet
state
still
we
were
to
follow
them
and
we
might
support
autocracy
in
one
state
and
soviets
in
another
if
it
seemed
suitable
again
this
sounds
like
some
of
our
more
notorious
politicians
carson
for
instance
but
the
likeness
is
superficial
we
began
in
march
peacock
and
i
were
the
editors
we
did
and
do
always
agree
peacock
for
instance
believes
in
democracy
peacock
also
accepts
poetry
poetry
about
the
war
by
people
like
johnny
potter
every
one
knows
that
school
of
poetry
by
heart
now
of
course
it
was
particularly
fashionable
immediately
after
the
war
johnny
potter
did
it
much
like
other
men
any
one
can
do
it
one
takes
some
dirty
horrible
incident
or
sight
of
the
and
describes
it
in
loathsome
detail
and
then
by
way
of
contrast
describes
some
fat
and
incredibly
bloodthirsty
woman
or
clubman
at
home
gloating
over
the
glorious
war
i
always
thought
it
a
great
bore
and
sentimental
at
that
but
it
was
the
thing
for
a
time
and
people
seemed
to
be
impressed
by
it
and
peacock
who
encouraged
young
men
often
to
their
detriment
would
take
it
for
the
though
that
sort
of
cheap
and
popular
appeal
to
sentiment
was
the
last
thing
the
was
out
for
johnny
potter
like
other
people
was
merely
exploiting
his
experiences
johnny
would
he
a
nice
chap
and
a
cleverish
chap
in
the
shrewd
unimaginative
potter
way
jane
way
too
only
she
a
shade
cleverer
but
chiefly
he
determined
to
get
there
somehow
potter
again
and
that
where
jane
and
johnny
amuse
me
they
up
against
what
we
agreed
to
call
potterism
the
potterism
that
is
of
sentimentalism
and
cheap
and
mediocrity
they
stand
for
brain
and
clear
thinking
against
muddle
and
cant
but
fighting
it
with
potterite
weapons
following
things
for
what
they
bring
them
rather
than
for
the
things
in
themselves
john
would
never
write
the
particular
kind
of
stuff
he
does
for
the
love
of
writing
it
he
only
do
it
because
it
the
stunt
of
the
moment
that
why
he
never
be
more
than
cleverish
and
mediocre
never
the
real
thing
in
his
calm
unexcited
way
he
worships
success
and
he
get
it
like
old
pinkerton
though
of
course
he
met
plenty
of
the
bloodthirsty
he
writes
about
he
takes
most
of
what
he
says
about
them
from
other
people
it
not
observation
if
it
was
he
would
have
to
include
among
his
jingoes
and
some
fighting
men
too
i
know
it
entirely
against
popular
convention
to
say
so
but
some
of
the
most
bloodthirsty
i
met
during
the
war
were
among
the
fighting
men
of
course
there
were
plenty
of
them
at
home
too
and
plenty
of
peaceable
and
civilised
people
at
the
front
but
the
most
absurd
perversion
of
facts
to
make
out
that
all
our
combatants
were
full
of
sweet
reasonableness
any
one
who
knows
anything
about
the
psychological
effects
of
fighting
will
know
that
this
is
improbable
and
all
our
savages
though
i
do
say
nothing
in
the
theory
one
heard
that
the
natural
war
rage
of
not
having
the
physical
outlet
the
fighters
had
for
theirs
became
in
some
few
of
them
a
suppressed
freudian
complex
and
made
them
a
little
insane
i
do
know
anyhow
to
say
this
became
the
stunt
among
a
certain
section
so
it
was
probably
as
inaccurate
as
popular
sayings
usually
are
as
inaccurate
as
the
picture
drawn
by
another
section
the
potter
press
section
of
an
army
going
rejoicing
into
the
fight
for
right
what
one
specially
resented
was
the
way
the
men
who
had
been
killed
poor
devils
were
exploited
by
the
makers
of
speeches
and
the
writers
of
articles
first
they
perhaps
be
called
fallen
instead
of
killed
it
a
queer
thing
how
in
the
masculine
means
killed
in
the
war
and
the
feminine
given
over
to
a
particular
kind
of
vice
and
then
the
audience
or
the
readers
would
be
told
that
they
died
for
democracy
or
a
cleaner
world
when
very
likely
many
of
them
hated
the
first
and
never
gave
an
hour
thought
to
the
second
i
could
imagine
their
indignant
presences
in
the
albert
hall
at
gray
big
league
of
nations
meeting
in
may
listening
to
clynes
reasons
why
they
died
i
can
hear
dear
old
peter
clancy
on
why
he
died
a
cleaner
world
no
why
i
suppose
i
died
because
i
inadvertently
got
in
the
way
of
some
flying
missile
i
know
no
other
reason
and
i
suppose
i
was
there
to
get
in
its
way
because
it
part
of
belonging
to
a
nation
to
fight
its
battles
when
required
like
paying
its
taxes
or
keeping
its
laws
why
go
groping
for
reason
who
wants
democracy
any
old
way
and
the
world
was
good
enough
for
me
as
it
was
thank
you
no
of
course
it
clean
and
never
will
be
but
no
war
is
going
to
make
it
cleaner
not
a
way
wars
have
these
talkers
make
me
sick
if
clancy
the
thousands
of
clancys
could
have
been
there
i
think
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
they
would
have
been
saying
anyhow
personally
i
certainly
did
lose
my
foot
for
democracy
or
for
a
cleaner
world
i
lost
it
in
helping
to
win
the
war
a
quite
necessary
thing
in
the
circumstances
but
every
one
seemed
during
and
after
the
war
to
want
to
prove
that
the
fighters
thought
in
the
particular
way
they
thought
themselves
they
seemed
to
think
it
immeasurably
strengthened
their
case
heaven
only
knows
why
when
the
fighting
men
were
just
the
men
who
had
time
or
leisure
to
think
at
all
they
were
as
the
potterites
put
it
so
truly
doing
the
job
the
thinking
such
as
it
was
was
done
by
the
people
at
home
the
politicians
the
clergy
the
writers
the
women
the
men
with
certificates
in
government
offices
and
precious
poor
thinking
it
was
too
we
all
settled
down
to
life
and
work
again
as
best
we
could
johnny
potter
went
into
a
publisher
office
and
also
got
odd
jobs
of
reviewing
and
journalism
besides
writing
war
verse
and
poetry
of
passion
of
which
confusing
if
attractive
subject
he
really
knew
little
juke
was
demobilised
early
too
commenced
clergyman
again
got
a
job
as
curate
in
a
central
london
parish
and
lived
in
rooms
in
a
slummy
street
he
and
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
each
other
one
day
in
march
juke
and
i
were
lunching
together
at
the
club
when
johnny
came
in
and
joined
us
he
looked
rather
queer
and
amused
too
he
did
tell
us
anything
till
we
were
having
coffee
then
juke
or
i
said
jane
getting
on
in
paris
not
bored
yet
johnny
said
should
say
not
she
been
and
gone
and
done
it
got
engaged
to
hobart
i
heard
from
the
mater
this
morning
i
do
think
either
of
us
spoke
for
a
moment
then
juke
gave
a
long
whistle
and
said
lord
said
johnny
and
grinned
no
laughing
matter
said
juke
blandly
is
imperilling
her
immortal
soul
she
is
yoking
together
with
an
unbeliever
she
is
forming
an
unholy
alliance
with
mammon
we
must
stop
it
jane
said
johnny
might
as
well
try
and
stop
a
young
tank
he
meditated
for
a
moment
funny
thing
is
he
added
we
all
thought
it
was
clare
he
was
after
that
juke
said
judicially
have
been
all
right
your
elder
sister
could
have
had
hobart
and
the
without
betraying
her
principles
but
jane
the
i
say
why
is
she
doing
it
johnny
drew
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
consulted
it
mater
does
say
i
suppose
the
usual
reasons
why
do
people
do
it
i
do
nor
do
you
nor
does
gideon
so
we
ca
explain
i
did
think
jane
would
do
it
either
it
always
seemed
more
in
line
somehow
jane
and
i
always
thought
clare
would
marry
she
the
sort
feminine
and
all
that
you
know
upon
my
word
i
thought
jane
was
too
much
of
a
sportsman
to
go
tying
herself
up
with
husbands
and
babies
and
servants
and
things
what
the
devil
will
happen
to
all
she
meant
to
writing
public
speaking
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
suppose
a
girl
can
carry
on
to
a
certain
extent
though
even
if
she
is
married
ca
she
will
i
said
wo
give
up
anything
she
wants
to
do
for
a
trifle
like
marriage
i
was
sure
of
that
believe
you
right
johnny
agreed
it
will
be
jolly
awkward
being
married
to
hobart
and
writing
in
the
press
write
for
the
juke
said
make
hobart
give
her
a
job
on
it
having
begun
to
go
down
the
steep
descent
she
stop
till
she
gets
to
the
bottom
jane
thorough
but
that
was
precisely
what
i
did
think
jane
was
she
is
on
the
other
hand
given
to
making
something
good
out
of
as
many
worlds
as
she
can
simultaneously
martyrs
and
irishmen
fanatics
and
juke
are
thorough
not
jane
we
could
stay
gossiping
over
the
engagement
any
longer
so
we
left
it
at
that
the
man
lunching
at
the
next
table
might
have
concluded
that
johnny
sister
had
got
engaged
to
a
scoundrel
instead
of
to
the
talented
promising
and
highly
virtuous
young
editor
of
a
popular
daily
paper
being
another
member
of
the
i
dare
say
he
understood
but
no
one
had
tried
to
answer
juke
question
is
she
doing
it
johnny
had
supposed
the
usual
reasons
that
opens
a
probably
unanswerable
question
what
the
devil
the
usual
reasons
i
met
lady
pinkerton
and
her
elder
daughter
in
the
muzzle
department
of
the
army
and
navy
stores
the
next
week
that
was
one
of
the
annoying
aspects
of
the
muzzling
order
one
met
in
muzzle
shops
people
with
whom
neither
temperament
nor
circumstances
would
otherwise
have
thrown
one
i
have
a
particular
dislike
for
lady
pinkerton
and
she
for
me
i
hate
those
cold
shallow
eyes
and
clothes
drenched
in
scent
and
basilisk
pink
faces
whitened
with
powder
which
such
women
have
or
develop
when
i
look
at
her
i
think
of
all
her
frightful
books
and
the
frightful
serial
she
has
even
now
running
in
the
and
i
shudder
unobtrusively
i
hope
and
look
away
when
she
looks
at
me
she
thinks
jew
and
she
shudders
unobtrusively
too
and
looks
over
my
head
she
did
so
now
no
doubt
as
she
bowed
tahsome
this
muzzling
order
she
said
originally
have
two
pekingese
a
king
charles
and
a
pug
and
their
poor
little
faces
do
fit
any
muzzle
that
made
i
answered
with
some
inanity
about
my
mother
poltalloch
and
we
talked
for
a
moment
she
said
she
hoped
i
was
quite
all
right
again
and
i
suppose
i
said
i
was
with
my
leg
shooting
like
a
gathered
tooth
it
was
pretty
bad
all
that
spring
suddenly
i
felt
her
wanting
badly
to
tell
me
the
news
about
jane
she
wanted
to
tell
me
because
she
thought
she
would
be
scoring
off
me
knowing
that
what
she
would
call
my
over
jane
had
always
been
used
against
all
that
hobart
stands
for
i
felt
her
longing
to
throw
me
the
triumphant
morsel
of
news
has
deserted
you
and
all
your
tiresome
conceited
disturbing
clique
and
is
going
to
marry
the
promising
young
editor
of
her
father
chief
paper
but
something
restrained
her
i
caught
the
advance
and
retreat
of
her
intention
and
connected
it
with
her
daughter
who
stood
by
her
silent
with
an
absurd
pekingese
in
her
arms
anyhow
lady
pinkerton
held
in
her
news
and
i
left
them
i
dislike
lady
pinkerton
as
i
have
said
but
on
this
occasion
i
disliked
her
a
little
less
than
usual
for
that
maternal
instinct
which
had
robbed
her
of
her
triumph
i
went
to
see
katherine
varick
that
evening
i
often
do
when
i
have
been
meeting
women
like
lady
pinkerton
because
there
is
a
danger
that
that
kind
of
woman
so
common
and
in
a
sense
so
typical
may
get
to
bulk
too
large
in
one
view
of
women
and
lead
one
into
the
sin
of
generalisation
so
many
women
are
such
very
dreadful
fools
men
too
for
that
matter
but
more
women
that
one
needs
to
keep
in
pretty
frequent
touch
with
those
who
are
with
the
women
whose
brains
by
nature
and
training
grip
and
hold
of
these
katherine
varick
has
as
fine
and
keen
a
mind
and
as
good
a
head
as
any
i
know
she
is
touched
anywhere
with
potterism
she
has
the
scientific
temperament
katherine
and
i
are
great
friends
from
the
first
she
did
a
good
deal
of
work
for
the
reviews
of
scientific
books
mostly
i
went
to
see
her
to
get
the
taste
of
lady
pinkerton
out
of
my
mouth
i
found
her
doing
something
with
and
bottles
some
experiment
with
carbohydrates
i
think
it
was
i
watched
her
till
she
was
through
with
it
then
we
talked
that
is
the
way
one
puts
it
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
katherine
seldom
does
much
of
the
talking
one
talks
to
her
she
listens
and
puts
in
from
time
to
time
some
critical
comment
that
often
extraordinarily
clears
up
any
subject
one
is
talking
round
she
contributes
as
much
as
any
one
i
know
to
the
conversation
but
in
such
condensed
tabloids
that
it
does
take
her
long
most
things
do
seem
to
her
to
be
worth
saying
she
let
for
instance
a
chatterbox
like
juke
say
a
hundred
words
to
her
one
and
still
she
get
most
said
though
jukie
not
a
vapid
talker
either
she
told
me
coming
back
next
week
the
marriage
is
to
be
at
the
end
of
april
rapidity
worthy
of
the
hustling
press
jukie
will
be
sorry
he
hopes
yet
to
wrest
her
as
a
brand
from
the
burning
katherine
smiled
at
juke
characteristic
sanguineness
wo
do
that
if
jane
means
to
do
a
thing
she
does
it
jane
knows
what
she
wants
she
wants
hobart
i
pondered
it
turning
it
over
still
puzzled
wants
hobart
katherine
agreed
all
that
hobart
will
let
her
in
to
the
society
of
the
pinkerton
journalists
of
a
number
of
other
people
some
of
them
fairly
important
people
you
know
the
editor
of
the
has
to
transact
business
with
a
good
many
notorious
persons
no
doubt
that
would
amuse
jane
she
all
for
life
i
dare
say
the
wife
of
the
editor
of
the
has
a
pretty
good
front
window
for
the
show
jane
likes
playing
about
with
people
as
you
like
playing
with
ideas
and
i
with
chemicals
besides
beauty
counts
with
jane
it
does
with
every
one
she
probably
fallen
in
love
that
was
all
we
said
about
it
we
talked
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
about
the
but
when
i
went
to
jane
wedding
i
understood
about
the
of
other
people
that
hobart
let
jane
in
to
they
had
been
married
that
afternoon
by
the
registrar
jane
having
withstood
the
pressure
of
her
parents
who
preferred
weddings
to
be
in
churches
hobart
did
much
care
he
was
he
said
a
presbyterian
by
upbringing
but
sat
loosely
to
it
and
did
care
for
fussy
weddings
jane
frankly
disbelieved
in
what
she
called
that
sort
of
thing
so
they
went
before
the
registrar
and
gave
a
party
in
the
evening
at
the
carlton
we
all
went
even
juke
who
had
failed
to
snatch
jane
from
the
burning
i
do
know
that
it
was
a
much
queerer
party
than
other
wedding
parties
which
are
apt
to
be
an
mixture
of
the
bridegroom
circle
and
the
bride
and
except
for
jane
own
personal
friends
these
two
circles
largely
overlapped
in
this
case
the
room
was
full
of
journalists
important
and
unimportant
business
people
literary
people
and
a
few
politicians
of
the
same
colour
as
the
pinkerton
press
there
were
a
lot
of
dreadful
women
who
i
supposed
were
lady
friends
probably
literary
women
one
of
them
was
introduced
to
juke
as
editress
of
and
a
lot
of
vulgar
men
many
of
whom
looked
like
profiteers
but
besides
all
these
there
were
undoubtedly
interesting
people
and
people
of
importance
and
i
realised
that
the
editor
of
the
like
the
other
editors
of
important
papers
must
of
necessity
as
katherine
had
said
have
a
lot
to
do
with
such
people
and
there
in
the
middle
of
a
group
of
journalists
was
jane
jane
in
a
dead
white
frock
with
her
firm
round
young
shoulders
and
arms
and
her
firm
round
young
face
and
her
dark
hair
cut
across
her
broad
white
forehead
parted
a
little
like
a
child
at
one
side
and
falling
thick
and
straight
round
her
neck
like
a
mediaeval
page
she
wore
a
long
string
of
big
amber
beads
hobart
present
and
a
golden
girdle
round
her
high
sturdy
waist
i
saw
jane
in
a
sense
newly
that
evening
not
having
seen
her
for
some
time
and
i
saw
her
again
as
i
had
often
seen
her
in
the
past
a
greedy
lazy
spoilt
child
determined
to
take
and
keep
the
best
out
of
life
and
if
possible
pay
nothing
for
it
a
profiteer
as
much
as
the
fat
little
match
manufacturer
her
uncle
who
was
talking
to
hobart
and
in
whom
i
saw
a
resemblance
to
the
twins
and
i
saw
too
jane
queer
lazy
casual
charm
that
had
caught
and
held
hobart
and
weaned
him
from
the
feminine
graces
and
obviousnesses
of
clare
hobart
stood
near
jane
quiet
and
agreeable
and
a
chap
running
a
paper
jane
had
married
him
for
all
her
intellectual
scorn
of
the
because
she
was
herself
and
did
really
care
and
there
was
little
pinkerton
chatting
with
northcliffe
his
rival
and
friend
and
lady
pinkerton
boring
a
high
foreign
office
official
very
nearly
to
yawns
and
clare
potter
flushed
and
gallantly
gay
flitting
about
from
person
to
person
clare
was
always
restless
she
had
none
of
jane
phlegm
and
stolidity
and
johnny
putting
in
a
fairly
amusing
time
with
his
own
friends
and
acquaintances
and
frank
potter
talking
to
juke
about
his
new
parish
frank
discontented
all
the
war
because
he
could
get
out
to
france
without
paying
the
price
that
juke
had
paid
was
satisfied
with
life
for
the
moment
having
just
been
given
a
fashionable
and
rich
london
living
where
many
hundreds
weekly
sat
under
him
and
heard
him
preach
juke
was
the
member
of
that
crowd
i
should
personally
have
selected
to
discuss
fashionable
and
overpaid
livings
with
had
i
just
accepted
one
but
they
were
the
only
two
parsons
in
the
room
so
i
suppose
potter
thought
it
appropriate
i
overheard
pleased
fragments
such
as
thousand
communicants
only
at
sunday
evensong
which
indicated
that
the
new
parish
was
a
great
success
poor
chap
jukie
said
to
me
afterwards
in
a
wretched
position
he
has
to
profess
christianity
and
he
does
want
even
to
try
to
live
up
to
it
at
least
whenever
he
has
a
flash
of
desire
to
that
atheist
wife
of
his
puts
it
out
she
the
worst
sort
of
atheist
the
sort
that
says
her
prayers
regularly
why
are
parsons
allowed
to
marry
or
if
they
must
why
ca
their
wives
be
chosen
for
them
by
a
special
board
and
what
in
heaven
name
came
over
a
potter
that
he
should
take
orders
the
fight
between
potterism
and
christianity
it
the
funniest
spectacle
and
the
saddest
but
juke
on
christianity
always
leaves
me
cold
the
nation
to
which
i
on
one
side
belong
ca
be
expected
to
look
at
christianity
impartially
we
have
suffered
too
much
at
the
hands
of
christians
juke
and
the
other
hopeful
and
ardent
members
of
his
church
may
be
able
to
separate
christianity
from
christians
and
not
judge
the
one
by
the
other
but
i
ca
the
fact
that
christendom
is
what
it
is
has
always
disposed
of
christianity
as
a
working
force
to
my
mind
judaism
is
detestable
but
efficient
christianity
is
but
a
failure
as
of
course
parsons
like
juke
would
be
and
are
the
first
to
admit
they
say
it
aims
so
high
that
it
bound
to
fail
which
is
probably
true
but
that
makes
it
pretty
useless
as
a
working
human
religion
anyhow
i
quite
agree
with
juke
that
it
is
comic
to
see
poor
little
nonentities
like
frank
potter
caught
in
it
tangled
up
in
it
and
trying
to
get
free
and
carry
on
as
though
it
was
there
of
course
nearly
all
the
rest
of
that
crowd
at
jane
wedding
was
carrying
on
as
if
christianity
were
there
without
the
least
trouble
or
struggle
they
were
quite
right
it
was
there
nothing
was
there
for
most
of
them
but
and
personal
desire
we
were
the
lot
of
us
out
to
make
to
grab
and
keep
and
enjoy
nothing
else
counted
what
could
christianity
do
a
frail
tilting
crusading
george
up
against
the
monster
dragon
grab
who
held
us
all
in
his
coils
it
no
use
jukie
it
never
was
and
never
will
be
any
use
i
suddenly
grew
very
tired
of
that
party
it
seemed
a
monster
meeting
of
potterites
at
play
mediocrity
humbug
muddle
cant
cheap
stunts
the
room
was
full
of
it
all
i
went
across
to
jane
to
say
i
had
scarcely
spoken
to
her
yet
i
had
never
congratulated
her
on
her
engagement
but
jane
would
mind
about
that
or
expect
me
to
all
i
could
say
now
was
afraid
i
got
to
get
back
i
some
work
waiting
she
said
it
any
use
my
sending
you
anything
for
the
the
enemy
camp
i
smiled
at
her
she
smiled
too
not
ratted
you
know
i
still
an
i
shall
come
on
the
next
tour
of
investigation
whenever
that
is
you
write
for
the
i
asked
her
i
expect
oliver
says
he
can
get
me
some
of
the
reviewing
and
occasional
articles
but
i
do
want
to
be
tied
up
with
it
i
want
to
write
for
other
papers
too
you
take
poetry
i
observe
that
peacock
fault
not
mine
send
along
anything
you
think
may
suit
by
all
means
and
we
consider
it
you
most
likely
get
it
back
if
you
remember
to
enclose
a
stamped
envelope
and
thank
you
for
asking
me
to
your
party
hobart
i
said
to
lady
pinkerton
and
went
back
to
the
office
for
it
was
press
night
so
jane
got
married
chapter
ii
dining
with
the
hobarts
that
may
was
very
hot
one
sweltered
in
offices
streets
and
underground
trains
you
do
expect
this
kind
of
weather
in
early
may
which
is
usually
a
time
of
bitter
frosts
and
biting
winds
punctuated
by
thunderstorms
it
told
on
one
nerves
one
got
sick
of
work
and
people
i
quarrelled
all
round
with
peacock
about
the
paper
with
my
typist
about
her
punctuation
with
my
family
about
my
sister
engagement
rosalind
that
was
the
good
old
english
name
they
had
given
her
had
been
brought
up
like
myself
in
the
odour
of
public
school
and
oxford
anglicanism
she
had
been
at
lady
margaret
hall
my
father
had
grown
up
from
his
early
youth
most
resolutely
english
and
had
married
the
daughter
of
a
rich
manchester
cotton
manufacturer
their
two
children
sidneys
from
birth
were
to
ignore
the
unhappy
yiddish
strain
that
was
branded
like
a
deep
disgrace
into
their
father
earliest
experience
it
was
unlucky
for
my
parents
that
both
rosalind
and
i
reverted
to
type
rosalind
was
very
lovely
very
clever
and
unmistakably
a
jewess
at
roedean
she
pretended
she
was
who
would
she
was
still
there
when
i
came
of
age
and
became
gideon
so
she
did
join
me
in
that
but
when
she
left
school
and
went
up
to
oxford
she
began
to
develop
and
expand
mentally
and
took
her
own
line
and
by
the
time
she
was
twenty
she
was
as
i
never
was
a
nationalist
we
were
neither
of
us
ever
inclined
to
judaism
in
religion
we
shook
off
the
misfit
of
anglicanism
at
an
early
age
we
both
refused
at
fifteen
to
be
confirmed
but
take
to
our
national
faith
which
we
both
disliked
extremely
nor
did
we
like
most
of
our
fellow
jews
i
think
as
a
race
we
are
narrow
cowardly
avaricious
and
and
rosalind
thinks
we
are
oily
she
and
i
are
oily
by
the
way
we
are
both
the
lean
kind
perhaps
because
after
all
we
are
half
english
i
only
reverted
to
our
original
name
because
i
was
sickened
of
the
sidney
humbug
but
we
learnt
yiddish
and
read
hebrew
literature
and
discussed
repatriation
and
maintained
that
the
jews
were
the
brains
of
the
world
it
was
a
cross
to
our
parents
but
far
more
bitter
to
them
than
even
my
change
of
name
was
engagement
this
spring
of
to
boris
stefan
boris
had
been
living
and
painting
in
london
for
some
years
his
home
had
been
in
moscow
he
had
barely
escaped
with
his
life
from
a
pogrom
in
and
had
since
then
lived
in
england
he
had
served
in
the
war
belonged
to
several
secret
societies
of
a
harmless
sort
painted
pictures
that
had
attracted
a
good
deal
of
critical
notice
and
professed
bolshevik
sympathies
of
a
purely
academic
nature
as
so
many
of
these
sympathies
are
on
the
grounds
that
bolshevism
was
a
jewish
movement
he
and
i
differed
on
the
subject
of
bolshevism
i
have
never
seen
any
signs
either
of
constructive
ability
or
sound
principles
in
any
bolshevik
leader
nothing
but
enterprise
vindictiveness
hebrew
cunning
and
a
criminal
ruthlessness
they
not
statesmen
and
bolshevism
as
so
far
manifested
is
a
statesmanlike
system
it
holds
the
reins
too
tight
i
do
condemn
it
for
the
cruelties
committed
in
its
name
because
whenever
russians
get
excited
there
be
fiendish
cruelties
russians
are
like
that
the
most
cruel
devils
in
earth
or
hell
bolshevist
russians
are
no
worse
in
that
way
than
czarist
russians
except
when
i
am
listening
to
their
music
i
loathe
the
whole
race
great
stupid
brutal
immoral
sentimental
savages
when
i
think
of
them
i
feel
a
kind
of
nausea
oddly
touched
with
fear
that
must
be
hereditary
i
suppose
after
all
my
father
as
a
child
of
five
saw
his
mother
outraged
and
murdered
by
russian
police
anyhow
bolshevism
in
russian
hands
has
become
a
kind
of
stupid
crazy
devil
game
as
everything
always
has
but
i
do
want
to
discuss
bolshevism
here
boris
stefan
had
really
anything
to
do
with
it
he
was
a
politician
he
was
a
dreamy
simple
untidy
rather
childlike
person
with
a
wonderful
gift
for
painting
rosalind
and
i
had
got
to
know
him
at
the
club
they
were
both
beautiful
and
it
had
taken
them
long
to
fall
in
love
one
exile
marrying
another
that
was
the
bitterness
of
it
to
our
very
gentile
mother
and
our
sidneyfied
father
who
had
spent
fifty
years
living
down
his
origin
so
i
was
called
in
to
assist
in
averting
the
catastrophe
i
would
say
anything
except
that
it
seemed
very
suitable
and
that
annoyed
my
mother
i
remember
that
she
and
i
and
rosalind
argued
round
and
round
it
for
an
hour
one
hot
evening
in
the
at
queen
gate
finally
my
mother
said
very
well
if
rosalind
wants
a
lot
of
fat
yid
babies
with
hooked
noses
and
oily
hair
all
lending
money
on
usury
instead
of
getting
into
debt
like
christians
let
her
have
them
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
lot
of
you
i
do
know
what
i
done
to
deserve
two
sheenies
for
children
that
made
rosalind
giggle
and
eased
the
acrimony
of
the
discussion
my
mother
was
a
little
fair
woman
and
but
with
a
sense
of
fun
my
father
had
no
sense
of
fun
i
think
it
had
been
crushed
out
of
him
in
his
cradle
he
was
a
silent
man
though
he
could
like
all
jews
be
eloquent
with
a
thin
face
and
melancholy
dark
eyes
i
am
supposed
to
look
like
him
i
believe
he
too
spoke
to
me
that
evening
about
rosalind
engagement
i
remember
how
he
walked
up
and
down
the
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
his
head
bent
forward
and
his
quick
nervous
jerky
movements
do
like
it
arthur
i
feel
as
if
we
had
all
climbed
up
out
of
a
very
horrible
pit
into
a
place
of
safety
and
prosperity
and
honour
and
as
if
the
child
was
preparing
to
leap
down
into
the
pit
again
she
does
know
what
it
like
to
be
a
jew
i
do
and
i
saved
you
both
from
it
and
you
both
seem
bent
on
returning
to
the
pit
whence
you
were
digged
we
an
outcast
people
my
dear
an
outcast
people
his
black
eyes
were
haunted
by
memories
of
old
fears
the
fears
his
ancestors
had
had
in
them
listening
behind
frail
locked
doors
for
the
howl
with
the
jews
the
fears
that
had
been
branded
by
savages
into
his
own
infant
consciousness
half
a
century
ago
the
fears
seared
later
into
the
soul
of
a
boy
by
boyish
savages
at
an
english
school
the
fears
of
the
grown
man
always
hiding
something
always
pretending
always
afraid
i
discovered
then
and
this
is
why
i
am
recording
this
family
incident
here
why
it
connects
with
the
rest
of
my
life
at
this
time
that
potterism
has
for
one
of
its
surest
bases
fear
the
other
bases
are
ignorance
vulgarity
mental
laziness
sentimentality
and
greed
the
ignorance
which
does
not
know
facts
the
vulgarity
which
can
not
appreciate
values
the
laziness
which
will
not
try
to
learn
either
of
these
things
the
sentimentality
which
knowing
neither
is
stirred
by
the
valueless
and
the
untrue
the
greed
which
grabs
and
exploits
but
fear
is
worst
the
fear
of
public
opinion
the
fear
of
scandal
the
fear
of
independent
thought
of
loss
of
position
of
discomfort
of
consequences
of
truth
my
poor
parents
were
afraid
of
social
damage
to
their
child
afraid
lest
she
should
be
mixed
up
with
something
low
outcast
suspected
not
all
my
father
intellectual
brilliance
nor
all
my
mother
native
wit
could
save
them
from
this
pathetic
vulgar
ignorant
piece
of
snobbery
pathetic
vulgar
and
ignorant
because
if
they
had
only
known
it
rosalind
stood
to
lose
nothing
she
cared
for
by
allying
herself
with
a
jewish
painter
of
revolutionary
theories
not
a
single
person
whose
friendship
she
cared
for
but
would
be
as
much
her
friend
as
before
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
bristling
with
prejudices
and
social
snobberies
who
made
for
instance
my
mother
world
and
that
is
what
one
generation
should
always
try
to
understand
about
another
how
little
probably
each
cares
for
the
other
world
of
course
rosalind
married
boris
stefan
and
as
i
have
said
the
whole
incident
is
only
mentioned
to
illustrate
how
potterism
lurks
in
secret
places
and
flaunts
in
open
places
pervading
the
whole
fabric
of
human
society
peace
with
germany
was
signed
as
every
one
knows
on
june
nearly
every
one
crabbed
it
of
course
the
with
the
rest
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
did
as
garvin
put
it
sow
dragon
teeth
over
europe
it
certainly
seemed
a
poor
unconstructive
expensive
brittle
thing
enough
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
nearly
all
peace
treaties
are
pretty
bad
you
have
to
have
them
however
and
you
may
as
well
make
the
best
of
them
anyhow
bad
peace
as
it
looked
at
least
it
peace
and
that
was
something
new
and
unusual
and
i
confess
frankly
that
it
has
so
far
held
together
longer
than
i
for
one
ever
expected
it
would
i
am
writing
this
in
january
the
published
a
cheery
series
of
articles
dealing
with
each
clause
in
turn
and
explaining
why
it
was
bound
to
lead
immediately
or
ultimately
to
war
with
some
one
or
other
i
wrote
some
of
them
myself
but
i
was
out
on
some
points
though
most
have
had
time
yet
to
prove
themselves
said
jane
the
day
after
the
signature
suppose
we
can
get
on
with
the
things
that
matter
she
meant
housing
demobilisation
proportional
representation
health
questions
and
all
the
good
objects
which
the
society
for
equal
citizenship
had
at
heart
she
had
been
writing
some
articles
in
the
on
these
they
were
and
intelligent
but
not
expert
enough
for
the
and
that
as
i
began
to
see
was
partly
where
hobart
came
in
jane
wrote
cleverly
clearly
and
concisely
better
than
johnny
did
but
in
these
days
of
overcrowded
competent
journalism
well
it
is
not
unwise
to
marry
an
editor
of
standing
it
gives
you
a
better
place
in
the
queue
i
dined
at
the
hobarts
on
june
for
the
first
time
since
their
marriage
we
were
a
party
of
six
katherine
varick
was
there
and
a
distinguished
member
of
the
american
legation
and
his
wife
jane
handled
her
parties
competently
as
she
did
other
things
a
vivid
jolly
child
she
looked
in
love
with
life
and
the
fun
and
importance
of
her
new
position
the
bachelor
girl
or
man
just
married
is
an
amusing
study
to
me
especially
the
girl
with
her
new
responsibilities
her
new
and
more
significant
relation
to
life
and
society
later
she
is
sadly
apt
to
become
dull
to
have
her
individuality
merged
in
the
eternal
type
of
the
matron
and
the
mother
her
intellect
is
apt
to
lose
its
edge
her
mind
its
grip
it
is
the
sacrifice
paid
by
the
individual
to
the
race
but
at
first
she
is
often
a
delightful
combination
of
jolly
girl
and
responsible
woman
we
talked
i
remember
partly
about
the
government
and
how
soon
northcliffe
would
succeed
in
turning
it
out
the
pinkerton
press
was
giving
its
support
to
the
government
the
was
not
but
we
did
want
them
out
at
once
we
wanted
to
keep
them
on
until
some
one
of
constructive
ability
in
any
party
was
ready
to
take
the
reins
the
trouble
about
the
labour
people
was
that
so
far
there
was
no
one
of
constructive
ability
they
were
manifestly
unready
they
had
no
one
good
enough
no
party
had
it
was
the
old
problem
never
acuter
of
the
man
if
labour
was
to
produce
him
i
suspected
that
it
would
take
it
at
least
a
generation
of
hard
political
training
and
education
if
labour
had
got
in
then
it
would
have
been
a
mob
of
uneducated
and
uninformed
sentimentalists
led
and
used
by
a
few
trained
politicians
who
knew
the
tricks
of
the
trade
it
would
be
far
better
for
them
to
wait
till
the
present
generation
of
honest
mediocrities
died
out
and
a
new
and
differently
educated
generation
were
ready
to
take
hold
labour
that
bugbear
of
barnes
if
there
is
any
hope
for
the
british
constitution
which
probably
there
is
not
i
believe
it
lies
there
it
is
a
very
small
one
at
the
best
anyhow
it
certainly
did
not
at
this
period
lie
in
the
parliamentary
labour
party
that
body
of
incompetents
in
an
incompetent
house
it
was
in
discussing
this
that
i
discovered
that
hobart
could
discuss
he
could
talk
he
could
assert
produce
opinions
and
information
but
he
could
meet
or
answer
arguments
and
he
was
cautious
afraid
of
committing
himself
afraid
i
fancied
of
exposing
gulfs
in
his
equipment
of
information
for
like
other
journalists
of
his
type
his
habit
was
to
write
about
things
of
which
he
knew
little
old
pinkerton
remarked
once
at
a
dinner
to
american
newspaper
men
that
his
own
idea
of
a
good
journalist
was
a
man
who
could
sit
down
at
any
moment
and
write
a
column
on
any
subject
the
american
newspaper
men
cheered
this
it
was
their
idea
of
a
good
journalist
too
it
is
an
amusing
game
and
one
encouraged
by
the
league
to
waylay
and
tackle
them
about
their
leaders
turn
them
inside
out
and
show
how
empty
they
are
i
written
that
sort
of
leader
myself
of
course
but
not
for
the
we
do
allow
it
there
the
man
who
writes
is
the
man
who
knows
and
till
some
one
knows
no
one
writes
that
is
why
some
people
call
us
dry
heavy
lacking
in
ideas
and
say
we
are
like
a
blue
book
or
a
paper
read
to
the
british
association
we
are
proud
of
that
reputation
the
pinkerton
papers
and
the
others
can
supply
the
ideas
we
are
out
for
facts
anyhow
hobart
i
knew
for
an
ignorant
person
all
he
had
was
a
for
the
popular
point
of
view
that
was
why
pinkerton
who
knew
men
got
hold
of
him
he
was
a
true
potterite
possibly
i
always
saw
him
at
his
least
eloquent
and
his
most
cautious
because
he
did
like
me
and
knew
i
did
like
him
even
then
there
had
already
been
one
or
two
rather
acrimonious
disputes
between
my
paper
and
his
on
points
of
fact
the
hated
being
pinned
down
to
and
quarrelled
with
about
facts
facts
did
seem
to
the
pinkerton
press
things
worth
quarrelling
over
like
policy
principles
or
prejudices
the
story
goes
that
when
any
one
told
old
pinkerton
he
was
wrong
about
something
he
would
point
to
his
vast
circulation
using
it
as
an
argument
that
he
could
be
mistaken
if
you
still
pressed
and
proved
your
point
he
would
again
refer
to
his
circulation
but
using
it
this
time
as
an
indication
of
how
little
it
mattered
whether
his
facts
were
right
or
wrong
some
one
once
said
to
him
curiously
you
that
you
are
misleading
so
many
millions
to
which
he
replied
in
his
dry
little
voice
do
lead
or
mislead
the
millions
they
lead
me
little
pinkerton
sometimes
saw
a
long
way
farther
into
what
he
was
doing
than
you
guess
from
his
shoddy
press
he
had
queer
flashes
of
genius
but
hobart
had
hobart
did
see
anything
except
what
he
was
officially
paid
to
see
a
shallow
solemn
ass
i
looked
suddenly
at
jane
and
caught
her
watching
her
husband
silently
with
her
considering
dispassionate
look
he
was
talking
to
the
american
legation
about
the
traffic
strike
we
were
a
round
table
and
the
talk
was
general
then
i
knew
that
whether
jane
had
ever
been
in
love
with
hobart
or
not
she
was
not
so
now
i
knew
further
or
thought
i
knew
that
she
saw
him
precisely
as
i
did
of
course
she
did
his
beauty
came
in
it
always
does
between
men
and
women
confusing
the
issues
and
her
special
relation
to
him
and
a
hundred
other
things
the
relation
between
husband
and
wife
is
too
close
and
too
complex
for
clear
thinking
it
seems
always
to
lead
either
to
too
much
regard
or
to
an
excess
of
irritation
and
often
to
both
jane
looked
away
from
hobart
and
met
my
eyes
watching
her
her
expression
did
alter
nor
probably
did
mine
but
something
passed
between
us
some
unacknowledged
mutual
understanding
held
us
together
for
an
instant
it
was
unconscious
on
jane
part
and
involuntary
on
mine
she
had
meant
to
think
over
her
husband
with
me
i
had
meant
to
push
in
jane
was
loyal
and
i
was
but
we
neither
of
us
meant
that
i
hardly
talked
to
jane
that
evening
she
was
talking
after
dinner
to
katherine
and
the
american
legation
i
had
a
conversation
with
hobart
and
the
legation
wife
who
was
of
an
inquiring
turn
of
mind
like
all
of
her
race
and
asked
us
exhausting
questions
she
got
on
to
the
jewish
question
and
asked
us
for
our
views
on
the
reasons
for
in
europe
been
reading
the
she
said
i
told
her
she
could
do
better
if
she
was
investigating
are
they
fair
she
asked
ingenuously
i
replied
that
there
were
moments
in
which
i
had
a
horrible
suspicion
that
they
were
the
jews
are
really
a
huge
conspiracy
plotting
to
get
the
finances
of
europe
into
their
hands
her
eyes
round
and
shocked
turned
from
me
to
hobart
he
lightly
waved
her
to
me
must
ask
gideon
the
children
of
israel
are
his
speciality
his
dislike
of
me
gleamed
in
his
blue
eyes
and
in
his
supercilious
cold
smile
the
legation
wife
no
fool
must
have
seen
it
i
went
on
talking
rubbish
to
her
about
the
jews
and
the
finances
of
europe
i
do
remember
what
particular
rubbish
it
was
for
i
was
hardly
aware
of
it
at
the
time
what
i
was
vividly
and
intensely
and
quite
suddenly
aware
of
was
that
i
was
on
fire
with
the
same
anger
dislike
and
contempt
that
burned
in
hobart
towards
me
i
knew
that
evening
that
i
hated
him
even
though
i
was
sitting
in
his
house
and
smoking
his
cigarettes
i
wanted
to
be
savagely
rude
to
him
i
think
that
once
or
twice
i
came
very
near
to
being
so
katherine
and
i
went
home
by
the
same
bus
i
grumbled
to
her
about
hobart
all
the
way
i
could
help
it
the
fellow
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
a
nervous
disease
to
me
i
was
mentally
wriggling
and
quivering
with
him
katherine
laughed
presently
in
that
queer
silent
way
of
hers
worry
she
said
not
married
him
what
marriage
i
returned
a
public
danger
he
and
his
kind
katherine
said
truly
are
so
many
public
dangers
there
really
is
time
to
get
agitated
about
them
all
her
mind
seemed
still
to
be
running
on
marriage
for
she
added
presently
think
he
find
that
he
bitten
off
rather
more
than
he
can
chew
in
jane
can
go
to
the
devil
in
her
own
way
i
said
for
i
was
angry
with
jane
too
married
a
fellow
for
what
she
thinks
bring
her
i
dare
say
she
has
her
reward
katherine
i
believe
the
very
essence
of
potterism
going
for
things
for
what
they
bring
you
what
they
lead
to
instead
of
for
the
artists
care
for
the
potterites
regard
things
as
railway
trains
always
going
somewhere
getting
somewhere
artists
students
and
the
religious
they
have
the
single
eye
it
the
opposite
to
the
commercial
outlook
artists
will
look
at
a
little
fishing
town
or
country
village
and
find
it
a
thing
of
beauty
and
a
joy
for
ever
and
leave
it
to
itself
unless
they
yield
to
the
devil
and
paint
it
or
write
about
it
potterites
will
exploit
it
commercialise
it
bring
the
railway
to
it
and
the
thing
is
spoilt
oh
the
potterites
get
there
all
right
confound
them
they
the
progressives
of
the
world
they
they
have
their
reward
it
a
queer
thing
how
jews
ca
help
quoting
the
new
testament
even
jews
without
religion
seem
to
have
decided
katherine
said
jane
is
a
potterite
she
is
not
intellectually
you
can
be
a
potterite
in
many
ways
jane
accepts
the
though
she
recognises
it
as
such
the
plain
fact
is
i
was
in
a
fit
of
savage
jane
is
the
gesture
of
katherine
square
shoulders
may
have
meant
several
things
we
all
or
that
very
obvious
or
ca
be
bothered
to
consider
jane
any
more
or
merely
all
we
just
dined
there
anyhow
katherine
got
off
the
bus
at
this
point
i
was
left
repeating
to
myself
as
if
it
had
been
a
new
discovery
which
it
was
is
chapter
iii
seeing
jane
jane
was
taking
the
chair
at
a
meeting
of
a
section
of
the
society
for
equal
citizenship
the
speakers
were
all
girls
under
thirty
who
wanted
votes
they
spoke
rather
well
they
were
old
enough
to
have
become
sentimental
and
they
were
mostly
past
the
conventional
cliches
of
the
earlier
twenties
in
extreme
youth
one
has
to
be
one
know
enough
one
has
lived
or
learnt
enough
to
be
and
one
lacks
but
by
five
or
one
should
have
left
that
behind
one
should
know
what
one
thinks
and
what
one
means
and
be
able
to
state
it
in
clear
terms
that
is
what
these
girls
mostly
university
girls
did
jane
left
the
chair
and
spoke
too
i
had
known
jane
spoke
so
well
she
has
a
clever
coherent
way
of
making
her
points
and
is
concise
in
reply
if
questioned
quick
at
repartee
if
heckled
lady
pinkerton
was
sitting
in
the
row
in
front
of
juke
and
me
mother
and
daughter
it
was
very
queer
to
me
that
wordy
willowy
fool
and
the
sturdy
girl
in
the
chair
with
her
crisp
gripping
mind
yet
there
was
something
they
both
loved
success
perhaps
that
was
it
the
vulgarian
touch
i
felt
it
the
more
clearly
in
them
because
of
juke
at
my
side
and
yet
jukie
too
only
he
would
always
be
awake
to
it
on
his
guard
not
capitulating
jane
came
round
with
me
after
the
meeting
to
the
office
to
go
through
some
stuff
she
was
writing
for
us
about
the
meeting
she
had
to
come
then
though
it
was
late
because
next
day
was
press
day
we
been
there
ten
minutes
when
hobart
name
was
sent
in
with
the
message
that
he
was
just
going
home
and
was
hobart
ready
to
come
i
not
said
jane
to
me
shall
be
quite
ten
minutes
more
i
go
and
tell
him
she
went
outside
and
called
down
on
oliver
i
shall
be
some
time
yet
wait
he
called
up
and
jane
came
back
into
the
room
we
went
on
for
quite
ten
minutes
when
we
went
down
hobart
was
standing
by
the
front
door
waiting
did
you
track
me
jane
asked
mother
told
me
where
you
gone
she
called
at
the
on
her
way
home
gideon
they
went
out
together
and
i
returned
to
the
office
irritated
a
little
by
being
hurried
it
was
just
like
lady
pinkerton
i
thought
to
have
gone
round
to
hobart
inciting
him
to
drag
jane
from
my
office
there
had
been
coldness
if
not
annoyance
in
hobart
manner
to
me
well
confound
him
it
was
to
be
expected
that
he
should
much
care
for
his
wife
to
write
for
the
but
he
might
mind
his
own
business
and
leave
jane
to
mind
hers
i
thought
peacock
came
in
at
this
point
and
we
worked
till
midnight
peacock
opened
a
parcel
of
review
books
from
hubert
wilkins
all
tripe
of
course
he
turned
them
over
impatiently
fools
the
fellows
are
to
go
on
sending
us
their
rubbish
they
might
have
learnt
by
now
that
we
never
take
any
notice
of
them
he
grumbled
he
picked
out
one
with
a
brilliant
wrapper
cabinet
minister
by
leila
yorke
that
woman
needs
a
lesson
gideon
she
a
public
nuisance
i
a
good
mind
a
jolly
good
mind
to
review
her
for
once
what
or
do
you
think
it
would
be
well
what
about
an
article
then
we
get
neilson
to
do
one
on
the
whole
tribe
of
fools
taking
lady
pinkerton
for
a
peg
to
hang
it
on
after
all
we
the
organ
of
the
league
we
ought
to
hammer
at
potterite
fiction
as
well
as
at
potterite
journalism
and
politics
for
two
pins
i
get
johnny
potter
to
do
it
he
would
i
believe
sure
he
would
but
it
would
be
a
little
too
indecent
neilson
shall
do
it
besides
he
do
it
better
or
do
it
yourself
you
will
not
my
acquaintance
with
the
subject
is
inadequate
and
i
no
intention
of
improving
it
in
the
end
peacock
did
it
himself
it
was
pretty
good
and
pretty
murderous
it
came
out
in
next
week
number
i
met
clare
potter
in
the
street
the
day
after
it
came
out
and
she
cut
me
dead
i
expect
she
thought
i
had
written
it
i
am
sure
she
never
read
the
but
no
doubt
the
family
had
been
drawn
to
the
article
as
people
always
express
it
when
writing
to
a
paper
to
remonstrate
about
something
in
it
they
have
liked
i
suppose
they
think
it
would
be
a
score
for
the
paper
if
they
admitted
that
they
had
come
across
it
in
the
natural
course
of
things
anyhow
they
want
to
imply
that
it
is
of
course
a
paper
decent
people
do
see
like
or
the
when
i
met
johnny
potter
he
grinned
and
said
for
you
old
bean
or
was
it
peacock
my
mother
persuaded
it
was
you
and
she
never
forgive
you
poor
old
mater
she
thought
her
new
book
rather
on
the
intellectual
side
full
of
and
all
that
i
say
i
wish
peacock
would
send
me
guthrie
new
book
to
do
that
was
johnny
all
over
he
was
always
asking
for
what
he
wanted
instead
of
waiting
for
what
we
thought
fit
to
send
him
i
was
sure
that
when
he
published
a
book
he
write
round
to
the
editors
telling
them
who
was
to
review
it
i
said
think
neilson
going
to
do
it
and
determined
that
it
should
be
so
johnny
brand
of
grabbing
bored
me
jane
did
the
same
a
greedy
pair
never
seeing
why
they
should
have
all
they
wanted
it
was
at
this
time
july
that
a
long
quarrel
started
between
the
and
the
about
the
miners
strike
the
pinkerton
press
did
its
level
best
to
muddle
the
issues
of
that
strike
by
distorting
some
facts
passing
over
others
and
inventing
more
by
the
time
you
read
a
leader
in
the
on
the
subject
you
have
got
the
impression
that
the
strikers
were
bolshevists
helped
by
german
money
and
aiming
at
a
social
revolution
instead
of
discontented
needy
and
greedy
british
workmen
grabbing
at
more
money
and
less
work
in
the
normal
greedy
human
way
we
all
have
bonar
law
departing
for
once
rather
unhappily
from
his
government
have
given
me
no
attitude
announced
that
the
miners
were
striking
against
conscription
and
the
war
with
russia
some
labour
papers
said
they
were
striking
against
the
government
shifty
methods
and
broken
pledges
i
am
sure
both
parties
credited
them
with
too
much
idealism
and
too
little
plain
they
were
striking
to
get
the
pay
and
hours
they
wanted
out
of
the
government
and
of
course
for
nationalisation
they
were
not
idealists
and
not
bolshevists
but
frank
grabbers
like
most
of
us
but
as
every
one
will
remember
had
become
at
this
period
a
vague
term
of
abuse
like
during
the
war
people
who
did
like
carson
called
him
a
bolshevist
people
who
did
like
manual
labourers
called
bolshevists
what
all
these
users
of
the
mysterious
and
elastic
epithet
lacked
was
a
clear
understanding
and
definition
of
bolshevism
the
of
course
and
to
do
it
justice
many
other
papers
used
the
word
freely
as
meaning
the
desire
for
better
conditions
and
belief
in
the
strike
as
a
legitimate
means
of
obtaining
them
i
suppose
it
took
a
shorter
time
to
say
or
write
than
this
does
anyhow
it
bore
a
large
vague
potterish
meaning
that
was
irresistible
to
people
in
general
the
made
such
a
fool
of
itself
over
the
miners
that
we
came
to
blows
with
them
and
quarrelled
all
through
july
and
august
mostly
over
trivial
and
petty
points
i
may
add
that
the
was
not
supporting
immediate
nationalisation
we
were
against
it
for
reasons
that
it
would
be
too
tedious
to
explain
here
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
that
all
i
record
of
this
so
recent
history
is
too
tedious
i
do
not
seem
to
be
able
to
avoid
most
of
it
but
even
i
draw
the
line
somewhere
the
controversy
between
the
and
the
seemed
after
a
time
to
resolve
itself
largely
into
a
personal
quarrel
between
hobart
and
myself
he
was
annoyed
that
jane
occasionally
wrote
for
us
i
suppose
it
was
natural
that
he
should
be
annoyed
and
he
did
like
her
to
frequent
the
club
to
which
a
lot
of
us
belonged
jane
often
lunched
there
so
did
i
she
said
that
you
got
a
better
lunch
there
than
at
the
women
university
club
not
much
better
but
still
better
you
also
met
more
people
you
wanted
to
meet
as
well
as
more
people
you
did
we
started
a
sort
of
informal
lunch
club
which
met
there
and
lunched
together
on
thursdays
it
consisted
of
jane
katherine
varick
juke
peacock
johnny
potter
and
myself
often
other
people
joined
us
by
invitation
my
sister
rosalind
and
her
husband
any
girl
johnny
potter
was
for
the
moment
in
love
with
and
friends
of
peacock
juke
or
mine
juke
would
sometimes
bring
a
parson
in
this
was
rather
widening
for
us
i
think
and
i
dare
say
for
the
parson
too
to
juke
it
was
part
of
the
enterprise
of
the
church
which
was
on
his
mind
a
good
deal
he
said
it
needed
as
much
as
the
state
or
literature
or
journalism
or
even
the
drama
and
that
potterism
in
it
was
even
more
dangerous
than
in
these
so
when
he
could
he
induced
parsons
to
join
the
league
we
were
all
tied
up
i
may
say
with
the
political
party
principles
very
commonly
held
by
members
of
the
club
i
certainly
was
a
socialist
nor
wholly
i
think
a
radical
neither
at
that
time
was
peacock
though
he
became
more
so
as
time
went
on
nor
certainly
was
katherine
juke
was
because
he
believed
that
in
these
principles
was
the
only
hope
for
the
world
and
the
twins
were
because
the
same
principles
were
the
only
wear
for
the
young
intellectual
at
that
moment
johnny
in
all
things
the
glass
of
fashion
and
the
mould
of
form
wore
them
as
he
wore
his
monocle
quite
unconscious
of
his
own
reasons
for
both
but
it
was
the
idea
of
the
league
to
keep
clear
of
parties
and
labels
you
belong
to
a
recognised
political
party
and
be
an
for
potterism
is
a
frame
of
mind
not
a
set
of
opinions
juke
was
after
katherine
the
best
i
have
known
though
people
did
their
best
to
spoil
him
but
it
is
easier
and
more
compatible
with
your
objects
to
be
free
to
think
what
you
like
about
everything
once
you
are
tied
up
with
a
party
you
can
only
avoid
taking
over
views
if
you
are
very
indeed
thursday
was
a
fairly
free
afternoon
for
me
and
jane
and
i
somehow
got
into
a
habit
of
going
off
somewhere
together
after
lunch
or
staying
on
at
the
club
and
talking
jane
seemed
to
me
to
be
increasingly
interesting
she
was
acquiring
new
subtleties
complexities
and
comprehensions
and
shedding
crudities
she
wrote
better
too
we
took
her
stuff
sometimes
for
the
at
the
same
time
she
seemed
to
me
to
be
morally
deteriorating
as
people
who
grab
and
take
things
they
ought
to
have
always
do
deteriorate
and
she
was
trying
all
the
time
to
square
hobart
with
the
rest
of
her
life
fitting
him
in
as
it
were
and
he
did
fit
in
i
was
interested
to
see
what
she
was
making
of
it
all
one
thursday
in
early
september
when
juke
and
jane
and
i
had
lunched
alone
together
at
the
club
and
jane
and
i
had
gone
off
to
some
meeting
afterwards
juke
dropped
in
on
me
in
the
evening
after
dinner
he
sat
down
and
lit
a
pipe
then
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
and
i
knew
he
had
something
on
his
mind
but
was
going
to
help
him
out
i
felt
hard
and
rather
sore
that
evening
soon
he
said
in
his
soft
indifferent
voice
course
you
be
angry
at
what
i
going
to
say
think
it
probable
i
replied
the
look
of
you
but
go
on
he
said
quietly
do
think
these
thursday
lunches
will
do
any
more
you
i
asked
any
of
us
not
with
jane
hobart
there
he
would
look
at
me
but
stood
by
the
window
looking
out
at
gray
inn
road
why
not
with
jane
because
she
married
to
the
enemy
makes
it
awkward
he
murmured
it
awkward
i
repeated
does
it
make
it
awkward
whom
does
it
make
awkward
it
does
make
jane
awkward
nor
me
nor
any
one
else
as
far
as
i
know
does
it
make
you
awkward
i
did
know
anything
could
do
that
but
something
obviously
has
this
evening
it
not
jane
though
it
being
afraid
to
say
what
you
mean
you
better
spit
it
out
jukie
you
not
enough
of
a
jesuit
to
handle
these
jobs
competently
you
know
i
know
perfectly
well
what
you
got
on
your
mind
you
think
jane
and
i
are
getting
too
intimate
with
each
other
you
think
falling
or
fallen
or
about
to
fall
in
love
he
wheeled
round
on
me
relieved
that
i
had
said
it
do
and
you
ca
deny
it
any
fool
could
see
it
by
now
why
the
way
you
mooned
about
depressed
and
sulky
this
last
month
when
been
out
of
town
and
woke
up
the
moment
she
came
back
was
enough
to
tell
any
one
dare
say
i
said
indifferently
minds
are
usually
offensively
open
to
that
particular
information
if
you
define
being
in
love
i
tell
you
whether
i
in
love
with
jane
i
interested
in
jane
i
find
her
attractive
if
you
like
extraordinarily
attractive
though
i
do
admire
her
character
and
she
not
beautiful
i
like
to
be
with
her
and
to
talk
to
her
on
the
other
hand
i
not
the
least
intention
of
asking
her
to
elope
with
me
nor
would
she
if
i
did
well
in
love
juke
repeated
may
know
it
but
you
are
and
you
get
deeper
in
every
day
if
you
do
pull
up
and
then
before
you
know
where
you
are
there
be
the
most
ghastly
mess
trouble
yourself
jukie
there
wo
be
a
mess
jane
does
like
messes
and
i
not
quite
a
fool
do
imagine
melodrama
i
claim
the
right
to
be
intimate
with
jane
well
if
you
like
to
be
a
little
in
love
with
jane
and
yet
to
keep
my
head
and
not
play
the
fool
why
should
men
and
women
lose
their
attraction
for
each
other
just
because
they
marry
and
promise
loyalty
to
some
one
person
they
can
keep
that
compact
and
yet
not
shut
themselves
away
from
other
men
and
other
women
they
must
have
friends
life
ca
be
an
eternal
duet
and
here
you
come
using
that
cant
potterish
phrase
in
love
as
if
love
was
the
sea
or
something
definite
that
you
must
be
in
or
out
of
and
always
know
which
sea
yes
juke
took
me
up
like
the
sea
it
advances
and
advances
and
you
ca
stand
there
and
stop
it
say
thus
far
and
no
farther
to
it
all
you
can
do
is
to
turn
your
back
upon
it
and
walk
away
in
time
i
not
going
to
walk
away
there
nothing
to
walk
away
from
i
no
intention
of
behaving
in
a
dishonourable
way
and
i
claim
the
right
to
be
friends
with
jane
so
that
that
i
was
angry
with
juke
he
was
taking
the
prudish
conventional
point
of
view
i
had
never
yet
been
the
victim
of
passion
love
between
men
and
women
had
always
rather
bored
me
it
is
such
a
hot
stupid
muddling
thing
ail
emotion
and
no
thought
dull
i
had
always
thought
it
one
of
those
impulses
arranged
by
nature
for
her
own
purposes
but
not
in
the
least
interesting
to
the
civilised
thinking
being
juke
had
no
right
to
speak
as
if
i
were
an
amorous
fool
liable
to
be
bowled
over
against
my
better
judgment
told
you
what
i
think
said
juke
bluntly
ca
do
any
more
it
your
own
show
he
took
out
his
watch
got
a
men
social
he
said
and
went
that
is
so
like
parsons
their
conversations
nearly
always
have
these
sudden
ends
but
i
suppose
that
is
not
their
fault
and
after
all
juke
was
right
juke
was
right
it
was
love
and
i
was
in
it
and
so
was
jane
five
minutes
after
juke
left
me
that
night
i
knew
that
i
had
been
in
love
with
jane
for
years
perhaps
since
before
the
war
only
i
had
never
known
it
on
that
investigation
tour
i
had
observed
and
analysed
her
and
smiled
cynically
to
myself
at
the
commercial
instinct
of
the
potter
twins
the
lack
of
the
fineness
that
distinguished
katherine
and
juke
i
remembered
that
but
i
remembered
too
how
white
and
round
jane
chin
had
looked
as
it
pressed
against
the
thymy
turf
of
the
cliff
where
we
lay
above
the
sea
all
through
the
war
i
had
seen
her
at
intervals
enjoying
life
finding
the
war
a
sort
of
lark
and
i
had
hated
her
because
she
did
care
for
the
death
and
torture
of
men
for
the
possible
defeat
of
her
country
or
the
already
achieved
economic
moral
and
intellectual
degradation
of
the
whole
of
europe
she
had
merely
profiteered
out
of
it
all
and
had
a
good
time
i
remembered
now
my
anger
and
my
scorn
but
i
remembered
too
the
squareness
and
the
whiteness
of
her
forehead
under
her
hair
that
leave
when
i
had
first
seen
it
bobbed
i
had
been
moved
by
desire
then
without
knowing
it
i
had
let
hobart
take
her
and
still
not
known
the
pang
i
had
felt
had
been
bitterness
at
having
lost
jane
not
bitterness
against
jane
for
having
made
a
marriage
but
i
knew
now
juke
words
in
retrospect
were
like
fire
to
petrol
i
was
suddenly
all
ablaze
in
that
case
juke
was
right
and
we
must
go
on
meeting
alone
there
might
be
as
he
said
the
most
ghastly
mess
because
i
knew
now
that
jane
was
in
love
with
me
too
a
little
we
could
go
on
it
was
too
it
was
stupid
uncivilised
all
i
most
hated
to
let
emotion
play
the
devil
with
reasoned
principles
and
theories
i
was
going
to
it
would
be
sentimental
sloppy
world
well
lost
for
love
as
in
a
favourite
novel
a
novel
by
leila
yorke
now
there
are
some
loves
that
the
world
important
though
it
is
may
be
well
lost
for
the
love
of
an
idea
a
principle
a
cause
a
discovery
a
piece
of
knowledge
or
of
beauty
perhaps
a
country
but
very
certainly
the
love
of
lovers
is
not
among
these
it
is
too
common
and
personal
a
thing
i
hate
the
whole
tribe
of
sentimental
men
and
women
who
impelled
by
the
unimaginative
fool
nature
exalt
sexual
love
above
its
proper
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
i
was
going
to
do
it
or
to
let
the
thing
upset
my
life
or
jane
i
kept
away
from
jane
all
that
week
she
rang
me
up
at
the
office
once
it
may
have
been
my
fancy
that
her
voice
sounded
strange
somehow
less
assured
than
usual
it
set
me
wondering
about
that
last
lunch
and
afternoon
together
which
had
roused
juke
had
it
roused
jane
too
what
had
happened
exactly
how
had
i
spoken
and
looked
i
could
remember
only
that
i
had
been
glad
very
glad
to
have
jane
back
in
town
again
i
did
go
to
the
club
next
thursday
as
it
happened
i
was
lunching
with
some
one
else
so
by
thursday
evening
i
had
seen
jane
for
a
week
wanting
company
i
went
to
katherine
flat
after
dinner
katherine
had
just
finished
dinner
and
with
her
was
jane
when
i
saw
her
lying
there
smoking
in
the
most
comfortable
as
usual
serene
and
lazy
and
pale
juke
words
blazed
up
between
us
like
a
fire
and
i
could
look
at
her
i
do
know
what
we
talked
about
i
expect
i
was
odd
and
absent
i
knew
katherine
was
looking
at
me
with
those
frosty
piercing
light
blue
eyes
of
hers
that
saw
through
and
through
and
beyond
all
the
time
i
was
saying
to
myself
wo
do
i
must
chuck
it
we
must
meet
i
think
jane
talked
about
which
she
disliked
and
lady
pinkerton
experiments
in
spiritualism
which
were
rather
funny
but
i
could
have
been
there
for
more
than
half
an
hour
before
jane
got
up
to
go
she
had
to
get
home
she
said
i
went
with
her
i
did
mean
to
but
i
did
and
here
if
any
one
wants
to
know
why
i
regard
in
love
as
a
disastrous
kink
in
the
mental
machinery
is
the
reason
it
impels
you
to
do
things
against
all
your
reasoned
will
and
intentions
my
madness
drove
me
out
with
jane
drove
me
to
see
her
home
by
the
hampstead
tube
to
walk
across
the
vale
of
health
with
her
in
the
moonlight
to
go
in
with
her
and
upstairs
to
the
all
this
time
we
had
talked
little
and
of
common
superficial
things
but
now
as
i
stood
in
the
long
room
and
watched
jane
take
off
her
hat
drop
it
on
a
table
and
stand
for
a
moment
with
her
back
to
me
turning
over
the
evening
post
i
knew
that
i
must
somehow
have
it
out
have
things
clear
and
straight
between
us
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
only
way
of
striking
any
sort
of
a
path
through
the
intricate
difficulties
of
our
future
relations
i
said
and
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
with
questioning
gray
eyes
at
that
i
had
no
words
for
explanation
or
anything
else
i
could
only
repeat
jane
jane
like
a
fool
she
said
very
low
arthur
as
if
she
were
assenting
to
some
statement
i
had
made
as
perhaps
she
was
i
somehow
found
that
i
had
caught
her
hands
in
mine
and
so
we
stood
together
but
still
i
said
nothing
but
because
that
was
all
that
for
the
moment
i
knew
hobart
stood
in
the
open
doorway
looking
at
us
white
and
quiet
he
said
we
fell
apart
loosing
each
other
hands
early
back
oliver
said
jane
composedly
obviously
he
returned
i
was
expected
my
anger
my
hatred
my
contempt
for
him
and
my
own
shame
blazed
in
me
together
i
faced
him
black
and
bitter
and
he
was
not
only
to
me
jane
husband
the
suspicious
ass
to
whom
she
was
tied
but
much
more
the
potterite
the
user
of
cant
phrases
the
ignorant
player
to
the
gallery
of
the
pinkerton
press
the
fool
who
had
so
little
sense
of
his
folly
that
he
disputed
on
facts
with
the
experts
who
wrote
for
the
in
him
at
that
moment
i
saw
all
the
potterism
of
this
dreadful
world
embodied
and
should
have
liked
to
have
struck
it
dead
exactly
i
asked
him
you
mean
by
that
he
smiled
jane
yawned
going
to
take
my
things
off
she
said
and
went
out
of
the
room
and
up
the
next
flight
of
stairs
to
her
bedroom
it
was
her
contemptuous
way
of
indicating
that
the
situation
was
in
fact
no
situation
at
all
but
merely
a
rather
boring
conversation
as
though
i
appreciated
her
attitude
i
could
agree
with
her
i
repeated
my
question
hobart
added
to
his
smile
a
shrug
part
iii
told
by
leila
yorke
chapter
i
the
terrible
tragedy
on
the
stairs
love
and
truth
are
the
only
things
that
count
i
have
often
thought
that
they
are
like
two
rafts
on
the
stormy
sea
of
life
which
otherwise
would
swamp
and
drown
us
struggling
human
beings
if
we
follow
these
two
stars
patiently
they
will
guide
us
at
last
into
port
love
the
love
of
our
kind
the
undying
love
of
a
mother
for
her
children
the
love
so
gloriously
exhibited
lately
of
a
soldier
for
his
country
the
eternal
love
between
a
man
and
a
woman
which
counts
the
world
well
lost
these
are
the
clues
through
the
wilderness
and
truth
the
truth
which
cries
in
the
with
a
loud
voice
and
will
not
be
hid
the
truth
which
sacrifices
comfort
joy
even
life
itself
for
the
sake
of
a
clear
vision
the
truth
which
is
far
stranger
than
fiction
this
is
very
twin
for
love
sake
then
and
for
truth
i
am
writing
this
account
of
a
very
sad
and
very
dreadful
period
in
the
lives
of
those
close
and
dear
to
me
i
want
to
be
very
frank
and
to
hide
nothing
i
think
in
my
books
i
am
almost
too
frank
sometimes
i
give
offence
and
hurt
people
egotism
and
vanity
by
speaking
out
but
it
is
the
way
i
have
to
write
i
can
not
soften
down
facts
to
please
just
as
i
can
not
restrain
my
sense
of
the
ridiculous
even
though
it
may
offend
those
who
take
themselves
solemnly
i
am
afraid
i
am
naughty
about
such
people
and
often
give
offence
it
is
one
of
the
penalties
attached
to
the
gift
of
humour
percy
often
tells
me
i
should
be
more
careful
but
my
dear
percy
wonderful
caution
that
has
helped
to
make
him
what
he
is
is
a
thing
that
no
mere
reckless
woman
can
hope
to
emulate
i
am
diverging
from
the
point
i
must
begin
with
that
dreadful
evening
of
the
of
september
last
clare
was
dining
with
a
friend
in
town
and
stopping
at
jane
house
in
hampstead
for
the
night
percy
and
i
were
spending
a
quiet
evening
at
our
house
at
potter
bar
we
were
both
busy
after
dinner
he
was
in
his
study
and
i
was
in
my
den
as
i
call
it
writing
another
instalment
of
gift
for
the
i
find
i
write
my
best
after
dinner
my
brain
gets
almost
feverishly
stimulated
my
doctor
tells
me
i
ought
not
to
work
late
it
is
not
fair
on
my
nerves
but
i
think
every
writer
has
to
live
more
or
less
on
his
or
her
nervous
capital
it
is
the
way
of
the
reckless
squandering
thriftless
tribe
we
are
laying
down
my
pen
at
after
completing
my
chapter
the
telephone
bell
suddenly
rang
the
maids
had
gone
up
to
bed
so
i
went
into
the
hall
to
take
the
call
or
to
put
it
through
to
percy
study
for
the
late
calls
are
usually
of
course
for
him
from
one
of
the
offices
but
it
was
not
for
him
it
was
jane
voice
speaking
that
you
mother
she
said
quite
quietly
and
steadily
been
an
accident
oliver
fell
downstairs
he
fell
backwards
and
broke
his
neck
he
died
soon
after
the
doctor
came
the
the
quiet
pluck
of
these
modern
girls
her
voice
hardly
shook
as
she
uttered
the
terrible
words
i
sat
down
trembling
all
over
and
the
tears
rushed
to
my
eyes
my
darling
child
and
her
dear
husband
cut
off
at
the
very
outset
of
their
mutual
happiness
and
in
this
awful
way
those
stairs
i
always
hated
them
they
are
so
steep
and
narrow
and
wind
so
sharply
round
a
corner
my
darling
i
said
the
last
train
gone
so
that
i
ca
be
with
you
till
the
morning
is
clare
there
said
jane
lying
down
she
fainted
my
poor
darling
clare
so
so
far
more
like
me
than
jane
is
and
i
always
had
a
suspicion
that
her
feeling
for
dear
oliver
went
very
deep
deeper
possibly
than
any
of
us
ever
guessed
for
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
poor
oliver
did
woo
clare
if
he
was
in
love
with
her
he
was
very
near
it
before
he
went
off
at
a
tangent
after
jane
who
was
something
new
and
therefore
attractive
to
him
besides
being
thrown
so
much
together
in
paris
when
jane
was
working
for
her
father
the
dear
child
has
put
up
a
brave
fight
ever
since
the
engagement
and
her
has
been
wonderful
but
she
has
not
been
her
old
self
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
unfortunate
european
conditions
i
should
have
sent
her
abroad
for
a
thorough
change
it
was
terrible
for
her
to
be
on
the
spot
when
this
awful
accident
happened
dear
dear
child
i
said
hardly
able
to
speak
my
voice
shook
so
with
crying
no
words
have
you
rung
up
frank
and
johnny
i
should
like
frank
to
be
with
you
i
know
he
would
wish
it
said
jane
no
use
bothering
them
till
they
do
anything
is
daddy
at
home
you
tell
him
then
my
darling
you
must
ring
off
yet
indeed
you
must
hold
on
while
i
tell
daddy
he
would
hate
not
to
speak
to
you
at
once
about
it
he
wo
need
to
speak
to
me
he
have
to
get
on
to
the
at
once
and
arrange
a
lot
of
things
i
can
keep
till
the
morning
mother
she
rang
off
there
is
something
terrible
to
me
about
telephone
conversations
when
they
deal
with
intimate
or
tragic
subjects
they
are
so
remote
cold
impersonal
like
typed
letters
is
it
because
one
watch
the
soul
in
the
eyes
of
the
person
one
is
talking
to
i
went
straight
to
percy
he
was
sitting
at
his
writing
table
going
through
papers
at
his
side
was
the
black
coffee
that
he
always
sipped
through
the
evenings
simmering
over
a
spirit
lamp
percy
will
never
go
up
to
bed
until
the
small
hours
i
suppose
it
is
his
newspaper
training
if
he
is
working
he
will
sit
and
read
or
sometimes
play
patience
and
always
sip
strong
coffee
though
his
doctor
has
told
him
he
should
give
it
up
but
he
is
like
me
he
lives
on
his
nervous
energy
reckless
of
consequences
he
spends
himself
and
is
spent
in
the
service
of
his
great
press
it
was
fortunate
for
him
though
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
say
it
that
he
married
a
woman
who
is
also
the
slave
of
literature
though
of
a
more
imaginative
branch
of
literature
and
who
can
understand
him
but
then
that
was
inevitable
he
could
never
have
cared
for
a
materialistic
woman
or
a
merely
domestic
woman
he
demanded
ideas
in
the
woman
to
whom
he
gave
himself
i
could
hardly
bear
to
tell
him
the
dreadful
news
i
knew
how
overcome
he
would
be
because
he
was
so
fond
of
dear
oliver
who
was
one
of
his
right
hands
as
well
as
a
dear
and
he
had
always
loved
jane
with
a
peculiar
pride
and
affection
devoted
father
as
he
was
to
all
his
children
for
he
said
she
had
the
best
brain
of
the
lot
and
oliver
had
been
doing
so
well
on
the
percy
had
often
said
he
was
an
editor
after
his
own
heart
he
had
so
much
flair
when
percy
said
some
one
had
flair
it
was
the
highest
praise
he
could
give
he
always
told
me
i
had
flair
and
that
was
why
he
was
so
eager
to
put
my
stories
in
his
papers
i
remember
his
remark
when
that
dreadful
man
arthur
gideon
said
in
some
review
or
other
i
dislike
his
reviews
they
are
so
conceited
and
cocksure
and
show
often
such
bad
taste
and
genius
are
incompatible
percy
said
simply
genius
i
thought
it
extraordinarily
true
but
whether
i
have
flair
or
not
i
do
know
i
do
think
i
ever
bother
about
what
the
public
want
or
what
will
sell
i
just
write
what
comes
natural
to
me
if
people
like
it
so
much
the
better
if
they
do
they
must
bear
it
but
i
will
say
that
they
usually
do
no
i
do
think
i
have
flair
i
think
i
have
instead
a
message
or
many
messages
but
i
had
to
break
it
to
percy
i
put
my
arms
round
him
and
told
him
quite
simply
he
was
quite
broken
up
by
it
but
of
course
the
first
thing
he
had
to
do
was
to
get
on
to
the
and
let
them
know
he
told
them
he
would
be
up
in
the
morning
to
make
arrangements
then
he
sat
and
thought
and
worked
out
plans
in
his
head
in
the
concentrated
abstracted
way
he
has
telephoning
sometimes
writing
notes
sometimes
almost
forgetting
my
presence
i
love
to
be
at
the
centre
of
the
brain
of
the
pinkerton
press
at
the
moments
when
it
is
working
at
top
speed
like
this
cup
after
cup
of
strong
black
coffee
he
drank
hardly
noticing
it
till
i
remonstrated
and
then
he
said
absently
well
dear
very
well
and
drank
more
when
i
tried
to
persuade
him
to
come
up
to
bed
he
said
no
i
have
things
to
think
out
i
shall
be
late
leave
me
my
dear
go
to
bed
yourself
you
need
rest
then
he
turned
from
the
newspaper
owner
to
the
father
and
sighed
heavily
and
said
little
janie
poor
dear
little
babs
well
well
well
i
left
him
and
went
upstairs
knowing
i
must
get
all
the
strength
i
could
before
my
poor
little
girl
a
widow
i
could
hardly
realise
it
and
yet
alas
how
many
young
widows
we
have
among
us
in
these
days
only
they
are
widowed
for
a
noble
cause
not
by
a
horrid
accident
on
the
stairs
poor
oliver
of
course
had
exemption
from
military
service
he
never
even
had
to
go
before
the
tribunal
for
it
but
had
it
direct
from
the
war
office
like
nearly
all
percy
staff
who
were
recognised
by
the
government
as
doing
more
important
work
at
home
than
they
could
have
done
at
the
front
i
have
a
horror
of
the
men
who
service
during
the
war
but
men
like
oliver
hobart
who
would
have
preferred
to
be
fighting
but
stayed
to
do
invaluable
work
for
their
country
one
must
respect
and
it
seemed
very
bitter
that
oliver
who
had
fallen
in
the
war
should
have
fallen
now
down
his
own
stairs
poor
poor
oliver
as
i
lay
in
bed
unable
to
sleep
i
saw
his
beautiful
face
before
me
he
was
quite
the
most
beautiful
man
i
have
ever
known
i
have
given
his
personal
appearance
to
the
hero
of
one
of
my
novels
a
it
was
terrible
to
me
to
think
of
that
beauty
lost
from
the
world
whatever
view
one
may
take
of
another
world
and
personally
far
as
i
am
from
any
orthodox
view
on
the
subject
my
spiritual
investigations
have
convinced
me
that
there
is
there
must
be
a
life
to
come
i
have
had
the
most
wonderful
experiences
that
may
not
be
denied
physical
beauty
one
must
believe
is
a
phenomenon
of
this
physical
universe
and
must
perish
with
the
body
unless
as
some
thinkers
have
conceived
the
immortal
soul
wraps
itself
about
in
some
aural
vapour
that
takes
the
form
it
wore
on
earth
this
is
a
possibility
and
i
would
gladly
believe
it
i
must
i
decided
try
to
bring
my
poor
jane
into
touch
with
psychic
interests
it
would
comfort
her
to
have
the
wonderful
chance
of
getting
into
communication
with
oliver
at
present
she
scouts
the
whole
thing
like
all
other
forms
of
supernatural
belief
jane
has
always
been
a
materialist
it
is
very
strange
to
me
that
my
children
have
developed
intellectually
and
spiritually
along
such
different
lines
from
myself
i
have
never
been
orthodox
i
am
not
even
now
an
orthodox
theosophist
i
am
not
of
the
stuff
which
can
fall
into
line
and
accept
things
from
others
it
seems
as
if
i
must
always
think
for
myself
delve
painfully
with
blood
and
tears
for
truth
but
i
have
always
been
profoundly
religious
the
spiritual
side
of
life
has
always
meant
a
very
great
deal
to
me
i
think
i
feel
almost
too
intensely
the
vibration
of
spirit
in
the
world
of
things
i
probe
and
wonder
and
can
not
let
it
alone
like
most
people
and
be
content
with
surfaces
of
late
years
and
especially
since
i
took
up
theosophy
i
have
found
great
joy
and
comfort
from
my
association
with
the
i
am
in
touch
with
several
very
wonderful
mediums
and
planchette
writers
who
have
often
strangely
illumined
the
dark
places
of
life
for
me
to
those
who
mock
and
doubt
i
merely
say
or
else
i
cite
not
nor
conan
doyle
but
that
strange
interesting
scientific
book
by
a
belfast
professor
who
made
experiments
in
weighing
the
tables
before
and
after
they
levitated
and
weighing
the
mediums
and
finding
them
all
lighter
i
think
that
was
it
anyhow
it
is
all
to
any
open
mind
entirely
convincing
that
had
occurred
out
of
the
normal
which
is
what
percy
and
the
twins
never
will
believe
when
i
say
to
percy
he
only
answers
should
fail
my
dear
i
may
as
i
have
been
called
be
a
superman
but
i
am
not
a
superwoman
and
can
not
call
up
spirits
and
the
children
are
hopeless
about
it
too
frank
says
we
are
not
intended
to
the
curtain
that
is
what
he
calls
it
he
is
such
a
thorough
clergyman
and
never
had
my
imagination
he
calls
my
explorations
in
the
occult
his
wife
jeers
and
asks
me
if
i
been
talking
to
many
spooks
lately
but
then
her
family
are
business
people
quite
different
from
me
clare
says
the
whole
thing
frightens
her
to
death
for
her
part
she
is
content
with
what
the
church
allows
of
spiritual
exploration
which
is
not
much
clare
since
what
i
am
afraid
i
must
call
her
trouble
has
been
getting
much
higher
church
incense
and
ritual
seem
to
comfort
her
i
know
the
phase
i
went
through
it
twenty
years
ago
when
my
baby
michael
died
and
the
world
seemed
at
an
end
but
i
came
out
the
other
side
it
could
last
for
me
i
had
to
have
much
more
clare
may
remain
content
with
it
she
has
not
got
my
perhaps
too
intense
instinct
for
groping
always
after
further
light
and
i
am
thankful
that
she
should
find
comfort
and
help
anywhere
only
i
rather
hope
she
will
never
join
the
roman
church
its
banks
are
too
narrow
to
hold
the
brimming
river
of
the
human
spirit
even
my
clare
which
does
not
perhaps
brim
very
high
dear
simple
child
that
she
is
as
for
the
twins
they
are
merely
cynical
about
all
experiments
with
the
supernatural
i
often
feel
that
if
my
little
michael
had
lived
but
in
a
way
i
am
thankful
to
have
him
on
the
other
side
reaching
his
baby
hands
across
to
me
in
the
way
he
so
often
does
that
night
i
determined
i
would
make
a
great
effort
to
bring
jane
into
the
circle
of
light
as
i
love
to
call
it
she
would
find
such
comfort
there
if
only
it
could
be
but
i
knew
it
would
be
difficult
jane
is
so
and
for
all
her
cleverness
in
writing
has
so
little
imagination
really
she
said
that
made
her
sick
and
she
would
look
at
or
the
latest
novel
about
the
other
side
she
quite
frankly
does
believe
there
is
another
side
i
remember
her
saying
to
me
once
in
her
slang
when
she
was
seventeen
or
so
i
like
to
think
i
went
on
mother
i
think
it
simply
rotten
pipping
out
i
being
alive
and
i
like
to
have
tons
more
of
it
but
there
it
is
i
believe
anything
so
weird
and
it
no
use
trying
and
if
i
do
pip
out
after
all
it
be
such
a
jolly
old
surprise
and
lark
that
i
shall
be
glad
i
could
believe
in
it
here
johnny
i
remember
said
to
her
those
two
were
always
ragging
each
other
you
may
be
wishing
you
only
pip
out
then
but
i
told
him
that
i
wished
he
would
even
in
joke
allude
to
that
bogey
of
the
nurseries
of
my
generation
a
place
of
punishment
that
terrible
old
teaching
thank
god
we
are
outgrowing
much
of
it
i
must
say
that
the
descriptions
they
give
when
they
give
any
of
their
place
of
being
do
not
sound
very
cheerful
but
it
can
not
at
all
resemble
the
place
of
torment
it
sounds
so
much
less
and
definite
than
that
more
like
london
in
a
yellow
fog
i
do
not
think
i
slept
that
night
i
am
bad
at
sleeping
when
i
have
had
a
shock
my
idiotic
nerves
again
crane
in
his
book
and
wrong
says
one
should
drop
discordant
thoughts
out
of
one
mind
as
one
drops
a
pebble
out
of
one
hand
but
my
interior
calm
is
not
yet
sufficient
for
this
exercise
and
i
confess
i
am
all
too
easily
shaken
to
pieces
by
trouble
especially
the
troubles
of
those
i
love
i
felt
a
wreck
when
i
met
percy
at
an
early
breakfast
next
morning
he
too
looked
jaded
and
strained
and
ate
hardly
any
breakfast
only
a
little
force
and
three
cups
of
strong
tea
an
inadequate
meal
as
i
told
him
upon
which
to
face
so
trying
a
day
for
we
had
to
have
strength
not
only
for
ourselves
but
for
our
children
giving
out
it
is
so
much
harder
work
than
taking
in
and
it
is
the
work
for
us
older
people
always
percy
passed
me
the
pointing
to
a
column
on
the
front
page
that
had
been
part
of
his
business
last
night
to
see
that
the
had
a
good
column
about
it
the
news
editor
had
turned
out
a
column
about
a
bolshevik
advance
on
the
dvina
to
make
room
for
it
and
it
was
side
by
side
with
the
rectory
oil
mystery
the
german
invasion
dumped
goods
of
course
the
glasgow
trades
union
congress
the
french
protest
about
syria
woman
mysterious
disappearance
and
a
tarring
and
feathering
court
martial
the
heading
was
death
of
the
editor
of
the
and
there
followed
not
only
a
full
report
of
the
disaster
but
an
account
of
oliver
career
with
one
of
those
newspaper
photographs
which
do
the
original
so
little
justice
been
pretty
sharp
about
it
said
percy
approvingly
course
he
had
all
the
biographical
facts
stored
we
went
up
by
the
and
went
straight
to
hampstead
quietly
and
sadly
we
entered
that
house
of
death
the
maid
all
flustered
and
with
emotional
unrest
told
us
that
jane
was
upstairs
and
clare
too
we
went
up
the
narrow
stairs
now
become
so
tragic
in
their
associations
on
which
step
i
wondered
had
he
fallen
and
how
far
jane
came
out
of
the
to
meet
us
she
was
pale
and
looked
as
if
she
had
slept
but
composed
as
she
always
is
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
gave
her
a
long
kiss
then
her
father
kissed
her
and
smoothed
her
hair
and
patted
her
head
as
he
used
to
do
when
she
was
a
child
and
said
there
there
my
poor
little
babs
there
there
there
i
led
her
into
the
i
felt
her
calm
was
unnatural
my
darling
i
said
your
cry
out
and
you
will
feel
better
i
she
said
do
think
so
mother
crying
does
make
me
feel
better
ever
it
makes
my
head
ache
i
thought
of
tennyson
young
war
widow
and
the
nurse
of
ninety
years
and
only
wished
it
could
have
been
six
months
later
so
that
i
could
have
set
jane
child
upon
her
knee
you
feel
you
can
my
darling
i
said
wiping
my
eyes
must
tell
me
all
about
it
but
not
before
you
want
to
is
much
to
tell
she
answered
quietly
still
without
tears
fell
down
the
stairs
backwards
that
all
you
see
him
darling
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
said
i
saw
him
i
was
in
here
just
come
in
from
the
office
he
lost
his
balance
you
feel
up
my
dear
said
her
father
giving
me
an
account
of
it
that
i
could
put
in
the
papers
can
put
that
in
the
papers
daddy
that
all
there
is
to
say
about
it
i
afraid
i
had
seventeen
reporters
round
this
morning
already
and
i
told
emily
to
tell
them
that
that
probably
another
she
added
as
the
bell
rang
but
it
was
not
emily
came
up
a
moment
later
and
asked
if
jane
could
see
gideon
it
showed
the
state
of
jane
nerves
that
she
started
a
little
she
never
starts
or
shows
surprise
besides
what
could
be
more
natural
than
that
gideon
who
disagreeable
man
though
he
is
is
a
close
friend
of
hers
far
too
close
i
always
thought
considering
that
oliver
was
on
almost
openly
bad
terms
with
him
should
call
to
inquire
on
seeing
the
dreadful
news
it
would
all
the
same
i
thought
have
been
better
taste
on
his
part
to
have
contented
himself
with
leaving
kind
inquiries
at
the
door
however
of
course
one
would
never
expect
him
to
do
the
or
thing
on
any
occasion
go
down
jane
said
quietly
you
wait
there
she
added
to
her
father
and
me
might
she
called
from
the
stairs
and
see
clare
she
in
her
room
i
crossed
the
passage
to
the
spare
bedroom
and
as
i
did
so
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
that
man
tall
rather
stooping
figure
in
the
hall
and
heard
jane
say
rather
low
and
add
quickly
and
dad
are
upstairs
come
in
here
then
they
disappeared
into
the
which
was
on
the
ground
floor
and
shut
the
door
after
them
i
went
in
to
clare
she
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
by
the
window
when
she
turned
her
face
to
me
i
recoiled
in
momentary
shock
her
poor
pretty
little
face
was
pinched
and
feverishly
flushed
her
brown
eyes
stared
at
me
as
if
she
was
seeing
ghosts
her
hands
were
locked
together
on
her
knees
and
she
was
huddled
and
shivering
though
it
was
a
warm
morning
i
had
known
she
would
feel
the
shock
terribly
but
i
had
hardly
been
prepared
for
this
i
was
seriously
afraid
she
was
going
to
be
ill
i
knelt
down
beside
her
and
drew
her
into
my
arms
where
she
lay
passive
seeming
hardly
to
realise
me
poor
little
girl
i
murmured
darling
cry
and
you
will
feel
better
clare
was
always
more
obedient
than
jane
she
did
cry
she
broke
suddenly
into
the
most
terrible
passion
of
tears
i
tried
to
hold
her
but
she
pulled
away
from
me
and
laid
her
head
upon
her
arms
and
sobbed
i
stayed
beside
her
and
comforted
her
as
best
i
could
and
finally
went
to
jane
medicine
cupboard
and
mixed
her
a
dose
of
sal
volatile
when
she
was
a
little
quieter
i
said
me
nothing
more
than
you
feel
inclined
to
darling
but
if
it
would
make
you
happier
to
talk
to
me
about
it
do
talk
about
it
she
sobbed
poor
pet
did
it
happen
after
you
got
here
or
before
i
felt
her
stiffen
and
grow
tense
as
at
a
dreadful
memory
but
i
was
in
my
room
i
was
there
heard
the
fall
i
suppose
she
shuddered
and
nodded
you
came
out
i
helped
her
gently
jane
did
and
found
him
she
burst
out
crying
afresh
i
almost
wished
i
had
not
suggested
this
outlet
for
her
horror
and
grief
mother
she
sobbed
ca
talk
about
it
i
ca
pet
of
course
you
ca
and
you
sha
it
was
thoughtless
of
me
to
think
that
speech
would
be
a
relief
lie
down
on
your
bed
dear
and
have
a
good
rest
and
you
will
feel
better
presently
but
she
opposed
that
too
ca
stay
here
i
want
to
go
home
once
at
mother
dearest
child
you
must
wait
for
me
i
ca
let
you
go
alone
in
this
state
and
i
ca
of
course
go
myself
until
jane
is
ready
to
come
with
me
going
she
repeated
can
go
alone
i
going
now
at
once
and
she
began
feverishly
cramming
her
things
into
her
i
was
anxious
about
her
but
i
did
not
like
to
thwart
her
in
her
present
mood
then
i
heard
frank
voice
in
the
and
i
thought
i
would
get
him
to
accompany
her
at
least
to
the
station
frank
and
clare
have
always
been
fond
of
one
another
and
she
has
a
special
reliance
on
clergymen
i
went
into
the
and
found
frank
and
johnny
both
there
with
jane
and
percy
so
that
dreadful
jew
must
have
gone
i
told
frank
that
clare
was
in
a
terrible
state
and
entrusted
her
to
his
care
frank
is
a
good
unselfish
brother
and
he
went
to
look
after
her
johnny
silent
and
troubled
and
looking
as
if
death
was
out
of
his
line
though
heaven
knows
he
had
seen
enough
of
it
during
the
last
five
years
was
fidgeting
awkwardly
about
the
room
his
awkwardness
was
no
doubt
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
he
had
never
much
cared
for
oliver
this
does
make
things
awkward
in
the
presence
of
the
great
silencer
percy
had
to
leave
us
now
in
order
to
go
to
the
and
see
about
things
there
he
said
he
would
be
back
in
the
afternoon
he
would
of
course
take
over
the
business
of
making
the
last
sad
arrangements
which
jane
called
rather
crudely
about
the
funeral
the
twins
would
always
call
spades
presently
i
made
the
suggestion
which
i
had
for
some
time
had
in
my
mind
i
dear
i
asked
very
softly
half
rising
jane
rose
too
oliver
you
mean
oh
yes
he
in
his
room
i
motioned
her
back
you
darling
johnny
will
take
me
johnny
did
want
to
much
i
think
it
is
the
sort
of
strain
on
the
emotions
that
he
dislikes
but
he
came
with
me
what
had
been
oliver
lay
on
the
bed
stretched
straight
out
the
beautiful
face
as
white
and
delicate
as
if
modelled
in
wax
one
saw
no
marks
of
injury
except
for
that
waxy
pallor
he
might
have
been
sleeping
in
the
presence
of
the
great
white
silence
i
bowed
my
head
and
wept
he
was
so
beautiful
and
had
been
so
alive
i
said
so
to
johnny
was
so
alive
i
said
short
a
time
ago
johnny
muttered
staring
down
at
the
bed
his
hands
in
his
pockets
of
course
rotten
bad
luck
poor
old
chap
rotten
way
to
get
pipped
for
a
minute
longer
i
kept
my
vigil
beside
that
inanimate
form
peace
he
is
not
dead
i
repeated
to
myself
sleeps
whom
men
call
dead
the
soul
of
adonais
like
a
star
beckons
from
the
abode
where
the
eternal
are
death
is
wonderful
to
me
not
a
horrible
thing
but
holy
and
high
here
was
the
lovely
mortal
shell
for
which
had
to
be
made
but
the
spirit
which
had
informed
it
was
where
in
what
place
under
what
conditions
would
oliver
hobart
now
fulfil
himself
now
carry
on
the
work
so
faithfully
begun
on
earth
what
word
would
he
be
able
to
send
us
from
that
place
of
being
time
would
i
hoped
show
as
we
stood
there
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
mystery
i
heard
frank
talking
to
clare
whose
room
was
next
door
is
wrong
to
give
way
one
must
not
grieve
for
the
dead
as
if
one
would
recall
them
we
know
you
and
i
know
do
we
clare
that
they
are
happier
where
they
are
and
we
know
too
that
it
is
god
will
and
that
he
decides
everything
for
the
best
we
must
not
rebel
against
it
if
you
really
want
to
catch
the
to
potter
bar
we
ought
to
start
now
conventional
phraseology
it
would
never
have
been
adequate
for
me
i
am
afraid
i
have
an
incurable
habit
of
rebelling
against
the
orthodox
dogma
beloved
of
clergymen
but
clare
is
more
docile
less
and
swift
and
proud
i
touched
johnny
arm
us
come
away
i
murmured
clare
her
face
beneath
her
veil
swollen
with
crying
went
off
with
frank
who
was
going
to
see
her
into
the
train
i
of
course
was
going
to
stop
with
jane
until
the
funeral
as
she
called
it
i
would
not
leave
her
alone
in
the
house
so
i
asked
frank
if
peggy
would
go
down
to
potter
bar
and
be
with
clare
who
was
certainly
not
fit
for
solitude
poor
child
until
my
return
peggy
is
a
dear
cheerful
girl
if
limited
and
she
and
clare
have
always
been
great
friends
frank
said
he
was
sure
peggy
would
do
this
and
i
went
back
to
jane
who
was
writing
necessary
letters
in
the
johnny
said
to
her
if
you
sure
i
ca
be
any
use
just
now
old
thing
i
suppose
i
ought
to
go
to
the
office
and
jane
said
do
stay
there
nothing
and
he
went
i
offered
to
help
jane
with
the
letters
but
she
said
she
could
easily
manage
them
and
i
thought
the
occupation
might
be
the
best
thing
for
her
so
i
left
her
to
it
and
went
down
to
speak
to
emily
jane
nice
little
maid
emily
is
a
good
little
thing
and
she
was
obviously
terribly
though
not
altogether
unpleasantly
shocked
and
stirred
maids
are
by
the
tragedy
she
told
me
much
more
about
the
terrible
evening
than
jane
or
clare
had
it
was
less
effort
of
course
for
her
to
speak
indeed
i
think
she
really
enjoyed
opening
out
to
me
and
i
liked
to
hear
i
always
must
get
a
clear
picture
of
events
i
suppose
it
is
the
instinct
went
up
to
bed
my
lady
she
said
a
bit
lonely
now
on
her
holiday
soon
after
miss
clare
came
in
and
i
was
just
off
to
sleep
when
i
heard
hobart
come
in
with
gideon
they
were
talking
as
they
came
up
to
the
and
that
woke
me
up
gideon
i
exclaimed
in
surprise
he
there
my
lady
he
came
in
with
hobart
i
knew
it
was
him
by
his
voice
and
soon
after
the
master
came
in
and
they
was
all
talking
together
and
then
i
heard
the
mistress
come
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
and
then
i
dozed
off
and
i
was
woke
by
the
fall
oh
dear
my
lady
how
i
did
scream
when
i
came
down
and
saw
there
was
the
poor
master
laying
on
the
bottom
stair
as
i
thought
i
sure
i
never
knew
he
was
gone
and
the
mistress
and
miss
clare
bending
over
him
and
the
mistress
calling
to
me
to
telephone
for
the
doctor
the
poor
mistress
she
was
so
white
i
thought
she
go
off
but
she
kept
up
wonderful
and
miss
clare
she
was
worse
all
scared
and
white
as
if
she
seen
a
ghost
i
rang
for
armes
and
he
came
round
at
once
and
i
got
bottles
and
put
them
in
the
bed
but
the
doctor
would
move
him
for
a
bit
he
examined
him
where
he
lay
and
he
found
the
back
was
broke
he
told
the
mistress
straight
out
his
back
broke
he
said
there
no
hope
he
said
it
may
be
a
few
hours
or
less
he
said
then
he
sent
for
a
mattress
and
we
laid
the
master
on
it
down
in
the
hall
and
put
bottles
to
his
feet
and
then
the
mistress
said
i
better
go
back
to
bed
but
oh
dear
i
could
do
that
so
i
just
waited
in
the
kitchen
and
got
a
kettle
boiling
in
case
the
mistress
and
miss
clare
would
like
a
cup
of
tea
and
i
had
a
cup
myself
my
lady
for
i
was
all
of
a
didder
and
nothing
pulls
you
round
like
a
drop
of
hot
tea
then
i
took
two
cups
out
into
the
hall
for
the
mistress
and
miss
clare
and
when
i
got
there
the
doctor
was
saying
it
all
over
and
dear
me
so
it
was
so
i
took
the
tea
back
to
keep
it
hot
against
they
were
ready
for
it
for
i
could
speak
to
them
of
tea
just
at
first
could
i
my
lady
then
the
doctor
called
me
and
there
was
miss
clare
laying
in
a
fit
and
he
was
bringing
her
round
he
told
me
to
help
her
to
her
room
and
so
i
did
and
she
seemed
half
and
did
say
a
word
but
dropped
on
her
bed
like
a
stone
then
i
had
to
help
the
doctor
and
the
mistress
carry
the
poor
master
on
the
mattress
up
to
his
room
and
lay
him
on
his
bed
and
the
doctor
saw
to
miss
clare
a
little
then
he
went
away
and
said
he
send
round
a
woman
for
the
laying
out
poor
miss
clare
i
was
sorry
for
her
laid
like
a
stone
she
did
as
white
as
milk
she
such
a
one
to
feel
is
she
my
lady
and
to
hear
the
fall
and
run
out
and
find
him
like
that
the
poor
master
them
stairs
i
always
hated
them
the
back
stairs
are
bad
enough
when
i
have
to
carry
the
hot
water
up
and
down
but
they
do
turn
so
sharp
the
poor
master
he
must
have
stumbled
backwards
the
light
not
being
good
and
fallen
clean
over
and
it
is
as
if
he
was
like
some
gentlemen
that
might
have
had
a
drop
at
dinner
no
one
ever
saw
the
master
the
worse
did
they
my
lady
i
sure
cook
and
me
and
every
one
always
thought
him
such
a
nice
good
gentleman
i
do
know
what
cook
will
say
when
she
hears
i
sure
i
do
is
indeed
all
very
terrible
and
sad
emily
i
said
to
her
i
left
her
then
and
went
up
to
the
jane
was
sitting
at
the
writing
table
her
pen
in
one
hand
her
forehead
resting
on
the
other
dear
i
said
to
her
has
been
giving
me
some
account
of
last
night
she
tells
me
that
gideon
was
here
quite
right
said
jane
listlessly
met
him
at
katherine
and
he
saw
me
home
and
came
in
for
a
little
i
was
silent
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
me
rather
sad
that
jane
should
have
this
memory
of
her
husband
last
evening
on
this
earth
for
she
knew
that
oliver
had
not
liked
her
to
see
much
of
gideon
i
understood
why
she
had
been
loath
to
mention
it
to
me
had
he
gone
i
asked
her
softly
it
happened
jane
frowned
in
the
way
the
twins
always
frown
when
people
put
things
less
bluntly
and
crudely
than
they
think
fit
for
some
reason
they
call
this
the
regard
for
the
ordinary
niceties
of
life
by
the
foolish
name
of
oliver
fell
she
corrected
me
still
in
that
quiet
listless
almost
indifferent
tone
yes
he
was
here
long
well
i
said
very
gently
must
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
not
grieve
over
much
grief
i
added
wanting
so
much
that
the
child
should
rise
to
the
opportunity
and
take
her
trial
in
a
large
spirit
such
a
big
strong
beautiful
thing
if
we
let
it
it
will
take
us
by
the
hands
and
lead
us
gently
along
by
the
waters
of
comfort
we
rebel
or
fight
we
must
look
straight
ahead
with
welcoming
eyes
for
whatever
life
brings
us
we
can
jane
still
sat
very
still
at
the
writing
table
her
head
on
her
hand
her
fingers
pushing
back
her
hair
from
her
forehead
i
thought
she
sighed
a
little
a
long
sigh
of
acquiescence
which
touched
me
this
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
moment
to
speak
to
her
of
what
was
in
my
mind
my
dear
i
said
is
another
thing
we
must
think
that
oliver
has
gone
down
into
silence
you
must
help
him
to
speak
to
you
a
little
later
when
you
are
fit
and
when
has
found
his
way
to
the
door
you
must
shut
him
out
my
child
said
jane
know
i
do
believe
in
any
of
that
only
ask
you
to
try
i
said
earnestly
bolt
and
bar
the
door
shall
try
my
dear
for
you
if
you
will
not
and
he
shall
communicate
with
you
through
me
sha
believe
it
said
jane
stating
not
a
resolve
but
a
fact
he
does
of
course
do
what
you
like
about
all
that
mother
i
care
but
if
you
do
mind
i
rather
not
hear
about
it
i
decided
to
put
off
any
further
discussion
of
the
question
particularly
as
the
child
looked
and
must
have
been
tired
out
i
went
down
to
the
kitchen
to
talk
to
emily
about
jane
lunch
i
felt
that
she
ought
to
have
a
beaten
egg
and
perhaps
a
little
fish
but
i
wished
that
she
had
told
me
frankly
about
that
man
gideon
visit
last
night
jane
was
always
so
reserved
chapter
ii
an
awful
suspicion
it
was
rather
a
strange
sad
life
into
which
we
settled
down
after
the
inquest
and
funeral
jane
remained
in
her
little
hampstead
house
she
said
she
preferred
it
though
particularly
in
view
of
the
dear
little
new
life
due
in
january
or
so
i
wanted
her
to
be
at
potter
bar
with
us
i
went
up
to
see
her
very
often
i
was
not
altogether
satisfied
about
her
though
outwardly
she
went
on
much
as
of
old
going
to
see
her
friends
writing
and
not
even
wearing
black
but
i
am
no
stickler
for
that
heathen
custom
it
was
however
about
clare
that
i
was
chiefly
troubled
the
poor
child
did
not
seem
able
to
rally
from
her
shock
at
all
she
crept
about
looking
miserable
and
strained
and
seemed
to
take
an
interest
in
nothing
i
sent
her
away
to
her
aunt
at
bournemouth
for
a
change
bournemouth
has
not
only
sea
air
but
ritualistic
churches
of
the
kind
she
likes
but
i
do
not
think
it
did
her
much
good
her
affection
for
poor
oliver
had
indeed
gone
very
deep
and
she
has
a
very
faithful
heart
percy
appointed
the
assistant
editor
to
the
editorship
he
had
not
oliver
flair
percy
said
but
he
did
very
well
on
the
lines
laid
out
for
him
there
was
a
rumour
in
fleet
street
that
the
proprietors
of
the
meant
to
start
a
daily
under
the
editorship
of
that
man
gideon
and
that
it
would
have
for
its
special
object
a
campaign
against
our
press
but
they
would
have
to
wait
for
some
time
till
the
paper
situation
was
easier
the
rumour
gave
percy
no
alarm
for
he
did
not
anticipate
a
long
life
for
such
a
venture
a
paper
under
such
management
would
certainly
never
he
said
achieve
more
than
a
small
circulation
meanwhile
times
were
very
troubled
the
labour
people
led
astray
by
that
bad
man
smillie
were
becoming
more
and
more
extreme
in
their
demands
ireland
was
as
always
very
disturbed
the
coalition
government
not
a
good
government
but
after
all
better
than
any
which
would
be
likely
to
succeed
it
was
shaking
from
one
blow
after
another
the
french
were
being
disagreeable
about
syria
the
italians
about
fiume
and
every
one
about
the
russian
invasion
or
evacuation
or
whatever
it
was
which
even
percy
press
joined
in
condemning
and
coal
was
exorbitant
and
food
prices
going
up
and
the
reviews
of
against
the
most
ignorant
and
unfair
i
believe
that
that
spiteful
article
of
gideon
about
me
did
a
good
deal
of
harm
among
ignorant
and
careless
reviewers
who
took
their
opinions
from
others
without
troubling
to
read
my
books
for
themselves
so
many
reviewers
are
like
that
stupid
and
prejudiced
people
who
can
not
think
for
themselves
and
often
merely
try
to
be
funny
about
a
book
instead
of
giving
it
fair
criticism
of
course
that
article
was
merely
comic
i
confess
i
laughed
at
it
though
i
believe
it
was
meant
to
be
taken
very
solemnly
but
i
was
always
like
that
i
know
it
is
shocking
of
me
but
i
have
to
laugh
when
people
are
pompous
and
absurd
my
sense
of
the
ridiculous
is
too
strong
for
me
after
oliver
death
i
did
not
recognise
gideon
when
i
met
him
not
in
the
least
on
personal
grounds
but
because
i
definitely
wished
to
discourage
his
intimacy
with
my
family
but
we
had
one
rather
strange
interview
i
was
going
to
see
jane
one
afternoon
soon
after
the
tragedy
and
as
i
was
emerging
from
the
tube
station
i
met
gideon
we
were
face
to
face
so
i
had
to
bow
which
i
did
very
coldly
and
i
was
surprised
when
he
stopped
and
said
in
that
morose
way
of
his
going
to
see
jane
are
you
lady
pinkerton
i
inclined
my
head
once
more
the
man
stood
at
my
side
staring
at
the
ground
and
fidgeting
and
biting
his
in
that
disagreeable
way
he
has
then
he
said
pinkerton
jane
unhappy
the
impertinence
of
the
man
who
was
he
to
tell
me
that
of
my
own
daughter
a
widow
of
a
few
weeks
i
replied
very
coolly
would
be
strange
indeed
if
she
were
not
well
he
made
a
queer
jerking
movement
say
it
not
my
business
but
please
do
er
let
people
worry
her
get
on
her
nerves
it
does
rather
you
know
and
and
she
not
fit
afraid
i
said
putting
up
my
lorgnette
do
not
altogether
understand
you
gideon
i
am
naturally
acquainted
with
my
state
better
than
any
one
else
can
be
gets
on
her
nerves
he
muttered
again
then
after
a
moment
of
silent
hesitation
he
half
shrugged
his
shoulders
mumbled
well
and
jerked
away
a
strange
person
amazingly
rude
and
to
take
upon
himself
to
warn
me
to
take
care
of
my
own
child
and
did
he
mean
on
her
nerves
i
really
began
to
think
he
must
be
a
little
mad
but
one
thing
was
apparent
his
feeling
towards
jane
was
as
i
had
long
suspected
much
warmer
than
was
right
in
the
circumstances
he
had
i
made
no
doubt
come
from
her
just
now
i
found
jane
silent
and
unresponsive
she
was
not
writing
when
i
came
in
but
sitting
doing
nothing
she
said
nothing
to
me
about
call
till
i
mentioned
him
myself
then
she
seemed
to
stiffen
a
little
i
saw
her
hands
clench
over
the
arms
of
her
chair
manner
was
very
strange
i
said
could
help
wondering
if
he
had
been
having
anything
he
was
drunk
you
mean
said
jane
dare
say
he
i
cried
a
little
surprised
jane
said
not
that
she
knew
of
but
every
one
did
sometimes
which
was
just
the
disagreeable
cynical
way
of
talking
that
i
regret
in
her
and
johnny
as
if
she
did
not
know
numbers
of
straight
decent
men
and
women
who
never
had
too
much
in
their
lives
but
anyhow
it
convinced
me
that
gideon
drink
too
much
and
that
she
knew
it
had
been
here
i
suppose
i
said
gently
because
i
did
want
to
seem
stern
said
jane
and
that
was
all
dear
i
said
after
a
moment
laying
my
hand
on
hers
this
man
worrying
you
with
attentions
jane
laughed
an
odd
hard
laugh
that
i
did
like
no
she
said
dear
no
mother
she
got
up
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
mind
arthur
she
said
would
let
him
get
on
my
mind
if
i
were
you
mother
let
talk
about
something
else
baby
if
you
like
i
perceived
from
this
that
jane
was
really
anxious
to
avoid
discussion
of
this
man
for
she
did
not
as
a
rule
encourage
me
to
talk
to
her
about
the
little
life
which
was
coming
as
we
hoped
next
spring
so
i
turned
from
the
subject
of
arthur
gideon
but
it
remained
on
my
mind
you
know
how
sometimes
one
wakes
suddenly
in
the
night
with
an
extraordinary
access
of
clearness
of
vision
so
that
a
dozen
small
things
which
have
occurred
during
the
day
and
passed
without
making
much
apparent
impression
on
one
mind
stand
out
sharp
and
defined
in
a
row
like
a
troop
of
soldiers
with
fixed
bayonets
all
pointing
in
one
direction
you
look
where
they
are
pointing
and
behold
you
see
some
new
fact
which
you
never
saw
before
and
you
can
not
imagine
how
you
came
to
have
missed
it
it
was
in
this
way
that
i
woke
in
the
middle
of
the
night
after
i
had
met
arthur
gideon
in
hampstead
all
in
a
row
the
facts
stood
pointing
gideon
had
been
in
the
house
only
a
few
minutes
before
oliver
was
killed
he
and
oliver
hated
each
other
privately
and
had
been
openly
quarrelling
in
the
press
for
some
time
he
had
an
intimacy
with
jane
which
oliver
disliked
oliver
must
have
been
displeased
at
his
coming
home
that
evening
with
jane
gideon
drank
gideon
now
had
something
on
his
mind
which
made
him
even
more
peculiar
than
usual
jane
had
been
very
strange
and
secretive
about
his
visit
there
on
the
fatal
evening
he
and
oliver
had
probably
quarrelled
only
jane
had
seen
oliver
fall
had
she
how
had
that
quarrel
ended
this
awful
question
shot
into
my
mind
like
an
arrow
and
i
sat
straight
up
in
bed
with
a
start
how
indeed
i
shuddered
but
unflinchingly
faced
an
awful
possibility
if
it
were
indeed
so
it
was
my
duty
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
discover
and
expose
the
awful
truth
painful
as
it
would
be
i
must
not
shrink
a
second
terrible
question
came
to
me
if
my
suspicion
were
correct
how
much
did
jane
know
or
guess
jane
had
been
most
strange
and
reserved
i
remembered
how
she
had
run
down
to
meet
the
wretched
man
that
first
morning
when
we
were
there
i
remembered
her
voice
rather
hurried
saying
mother
and
dad
are
upstairs
come
in
here
and
how
she
took
him
into
the
alone
did
jane
know
all
or
did
she
only
suspect
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
she
would
wish
to
shield
her
husband
murderer
if
he
were
that
yet
why
had
she
told
me
that
she
had
seen
the
accident
herself
if
indeed
my
terrible
suspicion
were
justified
and
if
jane
was
in
the
secret
it
seemed
to
point
to
a
graver
condition
of
things
than
i
had
supposed
no
girl
would
lie
to
shield
her
husband
murderer
unless
unless
she
was
much
fonder
of
him
than
a
married
woman
has
any
right
to
be
i
resolved
quickly
as
i
always
do
first
i
must
save
my
child
from
this
awful
man
secondly
i
must
discover
the
truth
as
expeditiously
as
possible
shrinking
from
no
means
thirdly
if
i
discovered
the
worst
and
it
had
to
be
exposed
i
must
see
that
jane
name
was
kept
entirely
out
of
it
the
journalistic
squabbles
and
mutual
antipathy
of
the
two
men
would
be
all
that
would
be
necessary
to
account
for
their
quarrel
together
with
gideon
probably
intoxicated
state
that
evening
i
heard
percy
moving
downstairs
still
and
i
nearly
went
down
to
him
to
communicate
my
suspicions
to
him
at
once
but
on
second
thoughts
i
refrained
percy
was
worried
with
a
great
many
things
just
now
besides
he
might
only
laugh
at
me
i
would
wait
until
i
had
thought
it
over
and
had
rather
more
to
go
on
then
i
would
tell
him
and
he
should
make
what
use
he
liked
of
it
in
the
papers
how
interested
he
would
be
if
the
man
who
was
one
of
his
bitterest
journalistic
foes
who
fought
so
venomously
everything
that
he
and
his
press
stood
for
and
who
was
the
of
the
possible
new
daily
should
be
proved
to
be
the
murderer
of
his
what
a
the
vulgar
journalese
slang
slid
into
my
mind
strangely
as
light
words
will
in
grave
moments
but
i
pulled
myself
together
i
was
going
too
far
ahead
after
all
i
was
still
merely
in
the
realms
of
fancy
and
suspicion
it
is
true
that
i
have
queer
almost
uncanny
intuitive
powers
which
have
seldom
failed
me
but
still
i
had
as
yet
little
to
go
on
with
an
effort
of
will
i
put
the
matter
out
of
my
mind
and
tried
to
sleep
counsel
would
i
felt
sure
come
in
the
morning
it
did
i
woke
with
the
words
ringing
in
my
head
as
if
some
one
had
spoken
them
not
consult
amy
ayres
of
course
that
was
the
very
thing
i
would
go
that
afternoon
amy
ayres
had
been
a
friend
of
mine
from
girlhood
we
had
always
been
in
the
closest
sympathy
although
our
paths
had
diverged
greatly
since
we
were
young
we
had
written
our
first
stories
together
for
and
and
and
together
enjoyed
the
first
sweets
of
success
but
while
i
had
pursued
the
literary
path
amy
had
not
her
interests
had
turned
more
and
more
to
the
occult
she
had
fallen
in
with
and
greatly
admired
besant
when
her
husband
a
swedenborgian
minister
left
her
at
the
call
of
his
conscience
to
convert
the
inhabitants
of
peru
to
swedenborgianism
and
finally
lost
his
life
under
peculiarly
painful
circumstances
in
the
vain
attempt
amy
turned
for
relief
to
spiritualism
which
was
just
then
at
its
zenith
of
popularity
at
first
she
practised
it
privately
and
unofficially
with
a
few
chosen
friends
for
it
was
something
very
sacred
to
her
but
gradually
as
she
came
to
discover
in
herself
wonderful
powers
of
divination
and
spiritual
receptivity
and
being
very
poor
at
the
time
she
took
it
up
as
a
calling
she
is
the
most
wonderful
and
i
have
come
across
i
have
brought
people
to
her
of
whom
she
has
known
nothing
at
all
and
she
has
after
close
study
and
brief
earnest
prayer
read
in
their
hands
their
whole
temperament
present
circumstances
past
history
and
future
destiny
i
have
often
tried
to
persuade
percy
to
go
to
her
for
i
think
it
would
convince
him
of
that
vast
world
of
spiritual
experience
which
lies
about
him
and
to
which
he
is
so
blind
if
i
have
to
pass
on
before
percy
he
will
be
left
bereaved
indeed
unless
i
can
convince
him
of
truth
first
i
went
to
see
amy
in
her
little
maid
of
honour
house
in
kensington
that
very
afternoon
i
found
her
reading
madame
blavatski
that
strange
woman
in
her
little
amy
has
not
worn
perhaps
quite
so
well
as
i
have
she
has
to
make
up
a
little
too
thickly
i
sometimes
wish
she
would
put
less
black
round
her
eyes
it
gives
her
a
stagey
look
which
i
think
in
her
particular
profession
it
is
most
important
not
to
have
as
people
are
in
any
case
so
inclined
to
doubt
the
genuineness
of
those
who
deal
in
the
occult
besides
what
an
odd
practice
that
painting
the
face
black
in
patches
is
as
unlike
real
life
as
a
clown
red
nose
though
i
suppose
less
unbecoming
i
myself
only
use
a
little
powder
which
is
so
necessary
in
hot
or
indeed
cold
weather
however
this
is
a
digression
i
kissed
amy
and
said
dear
i
am
here
on
business
i
am
in
great
perplexity
and
i
want
you
to
discover
something
from
the
crystal
are
you
in
the
mood
this
afternoon
for
i
have
enough
of
the
temperament
myself
to
know
that
even
more
than
literary
composition
must
wait
on
mood
fortunately
amy
said
she
was
in
a
most
favourable
condition
for
vision
and
i
told
her
as
briefly
as
possible
that
i
wished
to
learn
about
the
circumstances
attendant
on
the
death
of
oliver
hobart
i
wished
her
to
visualise
oliver
as
he
stood
that
evening
at
the
top
of
those
dreadful
stairs
and
to
watch
the
manner
of
his
fall
i
told
her
no
more
for
i
wanted
her
to
approach
the
subject
without
prejudice
without
more
ado
we
went
into
the
room
which
amy
called
her
temple
of
vision
and
amy
got
to
work
i
was
travelling
by
the
back
to
potter
bar
i
lay
back
in
my
corner
with
closed
eyes
recalling
the
events
of
that
wonderful
afternoon
in
the
darkened
scented
room
it
had
been
a
strange
almost
overwhelming
experience
i
had
been
keyed
up
to
a
point
of
tension
which
was
almost
unendurable
while
my
friend
gazed
and
murmured
into
the
glass
ball
these
glimpses
into
the
occult
are
really
too
much
for
my
system
they
wring
my
nerves
i
could
have
screamed
when
amy
said
wait
the
darkness
stirs
i
see
i
see
a
fair
man
with
the
face
of
a
greek
god
he
alone
i
whispered
is
not
alone
he
is
talking
to
a
tall
dark
man
yes
i
bent
forward
eagerly
as
she
paused
and
seemed
to
brood
over
the
clear
depths
where
as
i
knew
she
saw
shadows
forming
and
reforming
talk
she
murmured
talk
knowing
that
she
could
not
unfortunately
hear
what
they
said
i
did
not
ask
are
excited
they
are
quarrelling
oh
god
she
hid
her
eyes
for
a
moment
then
looked
again
dark
man
strikes
the
fair
man
he
is
taken
by
surprise
he
steps
backward
and
falls
falls
backwards
down
out
of
my
vision
the
dark
man
is
left
standing
alone
he
is
fading
he
is
gone
i
can
see
him
no
more
leila
i
have
come
to
an
end
i
am
overdone
i
must
rest
she
had
fallen
back
with
closed
eyes
a
little
later
when
she
had
revived
we
had
had
tea
together
and
i
had
put
a
few
questions
to
her
she
had
told
me
little
more
than
what
she
had
revealed
as
she
gazed
into
the
crystal
but
it
was
enough
she
knew
the
fair
man
for
oliver
for
she
had
seen
him
at
the
wedding
she
had
not
seen
the
dark
man
face
nor
had
she
ever
met
arthur
gideon
but
her
description
of
him
was
enough
for
me
i
had
left
the
house
morally
certain
that
arthur
gideon
had
murdered
or
anyhow
manslaughtered
oliver
hobart
i
told
percy
that
evening
after
clare
had
gone
to
bed
i
had
confidence
in
percy
he
would
believe
me
his
journalistic
instinct
for
the
truth
could
be
counted
on
he
never
waived
things
aside
as
improbable
for
he
knew
as
i
knew
how
much
stranger
truth
may
be
than
fiction
he
heard
me
out
nodding
his
head
sharply
from
time
to
time
to
show
that
he
followed
me
when
i
had
done
he
said
were
right
to
tell
me
we
must
look
into
it
it
will
if
proved
true
make
a
most
remarkable
story
most
sensational
and
remarkable
he
turned
it
over
in
that
acute
quick
brain
of
his
must
go
carefully
he
said
we
have
much
to
go
on
yet
he
did
believe
in
the
of
course
so
had
less
to
go
on
than
i
had
all
he
saw
was
the
inherent
possibility
of
the
story
knowing
as
he
did
the
hatred
that
had
existed
between
the
two
men
and
the
damning
fact
of
gideon
presence
at
the
house
that
evening
must
be
careful
he
repeated
for
one
thing
not
to
start
talk
about
the
fellow
friendship
with
jane
we
must
keep
jane
out
of
it
all
on
that
we
were
agreed
think
we
must
ask
clare
a
few
questions
said
percy
he
did
so
next
day
without
mentioning
our
suspicion
but
clare
could
still
scarcely
bear
to
speak
of
that
terrible
evening
poor
child
and
returned
incoherent
answers
she
knew
gideon
had
been
in
the
house
but
did
know
what
time
he
had
gone
nor
the
exact
time
of
the
accident
i
resolved
to
question
emily
jane
little
maid
more
closely
and
did
so
when
i
went
there
that
afternoon
she
was
certainly
more
circumstantial
than
she
had
been
when
she
had
told
me
the
story
before
in
the
first
shock
and
confusion
of
the
disaster
i
gathered
from
her
that
she
had
heard
her
master
and
gideon
talking
immediately
before
the
fall
she
had
been
surprised
when
her
mistress
had
said
that
gideon
had
left
the
house
before
the
fall
she
thought
from
the
sounds
that
he
must
have
left
the
house
immediately
afterwards
is
possible
i
said
hobart
did
not
know
precisely
when
gideon
left
the
house
it
was
all
very
confusing
my
lady
indeed
it
was
emily
agreed
sure
i
hope
i
shall
never
have
such
a
night
again
i
said
nothing
to
jane
of
my
suspicion
if
i
was
right
in
thinking
that
the
poor
misguided
child
was
shielding
her
husband
murderer
from
whatever
motives
of
pity
or
friendship
the
less
said
to
disturb
her
the
better
till
we
were
sure
of
our
ground
but
i
talked
to
a
few
other
people
about
it
on
whose
discretion
i
could
rely
i
tried
to
find
out
and
so
did
percy
what
was
this
man
record
what
transpired
of
it
was
not
reassuring
his
father
was
as
we
knew
before
a
naturalised
russian
jew
presumably
of
the
lowest
class
in
his
own
land
though
well
educated
from
childhood
in
this
country
he
was
as
every
one
knew
a
big
banker
and
mixed
up
no
doubt
with
all
sorts
of
shady
finance
some
people
said
he
was
probably
helping
to
finance
the
bolsheviks
his
daughter
had
married
a
russian
jewish
artist
jane
knew
this
artist
and
his
wife
well
at
that
silly
club
of
hers
arthur
gideon
on
coming
of
age
had
reverted
to
his
patronymic
name
enamoured
it
seemed
of
his
origin
he
had
of
course
to
fight
in
the
war
loath
though
he
no
doubt
was
but
directly
it
was
over
or
rather
directly
he
was
discharged
wounded
he
took
to
shady
journalism
hardly
a
reassuring
record
add
to
it
the
influence
he
had
always
attempted
to
exert
over
johnny
and
jane
he
had
even
in
oxford
days
brought
out
their
worst
side
his
quarrels
with
oliver
in
the
press
his
unconcealed
hatred
of
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
he
was
president
of
the
foolish
league
his
determined
intimacy
with
jane
against
her
husband
wishes
and
own
implication
that
he
at
times
drank
too
much
and
you
had
a
picture
of
a
man
unlikely
to
inspire
confidence
in
any
impartial
mind
anyhow
most
of
the
people
to
whom
i
broached
the
unpleasant
subject
and
i
saw
no
reason
why
i
should
not
speak
freely
of
my
suspicion
seemed
to
think
the
man
guilt
only
too
likely
some
of
my
friends
said
to
me
not
bring
a
charge
against
him
and
have
him
arrested
and
the
matter
thoroughly
investigated
but
percy
told
me
we
had
not
enough
to
go
on
for
that
yet
all
he
would
do
was
to
put
the
investigation
into
the
hands
of
a
detective
and
entrust
him
with
the
business
of
collecting
evidence
the
only
people
we
kept
the
matter
from
were
our
two
daughters
clare
would
have
been
too
dreadfully
upset
by
this
raking
up
of
the
tragedy
and
jane
could
not
in
her
present
state
be
disturbed
either
about
three
weeks
after
my
visit
to
amy
ayres
i
had
rather
a
trying
meeting
with
that
young
clergyman
juke
another
of
the
rather
queer
oxford
friends
he
is
the
son
of
that
bad
old
lord
aylesbury
who
married
some
dreadful
chorus
girl
a
year
or
two
ago
and
all
his
family
are
terribly
fast
we
met
at
a
bazaar
for
starving
clergy
at
the
dear
bishop
of
london
to
which
i
had
gone
with
frank
i
think
the
clergy
very
wrong
about
many
things
but
i
quite
agree
that
we
can
not
let
them
starve
besides
peggy
had
a
stall
for
jam
i
was
buying
some
armenian
doily
with
clare
at
my
side
when
a
voice
said
i
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
lady
pinkerton
and
turning
round
juke
stood
close
to
us
i
was
surprised
for
i
knew
him
very
little
but
i
said
do
you
do
juke
by
all
means
we
will
go
and
sit
over
there
by
the
missionary
bookstall
this
was
as
it
sometimes
is
the
least
frequented
stall
so
it
was
suitable
for
quiet
conversation
we
left
clare
and
went
to
the
bookstall
when
we
were
seated
in
two
chairs
near
it
juke
leant
forward
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
said
in
a
low
voice
came
here
hoping
to
meet
you
lady
pinkerton
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
it
about
my
friend
gideon
i
helped
him
out
my
interest
rising
had
he
anything
to
communicate
to
me
on
that
subject
the
young
man
went
on
staring
at
the
ground
between
his
knees
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
his
profile
was
very
like
granville
barker
am
told
he
said
in
grave
quick
low
tones
you
are
saying
things
about
him
rather
indiscriminately
bringing
in
fact
charges
against
him
suspicions
rather
i
hardly
think
you
can
be
aware
of
the
seriousness
of
such
irresponsible
gossip
such
i
ca
call
it
anything
but
slander
when
it
is
widely
circulated
how
it
grows
spreads
from
person
to
person
the
damage
the
irreparable
damage
it
may
do
he
broke
off
incoherently
and
was
silent
i
confess
i
was
taken
aback
but
i
stood
to
my
guns
i
said
the
irresponsible
gossip
as
you
call
it
happens
to
be
true
juke
what
then
he
said
abruptly
and
looked
me
in
the
face
lady
pinkerton
gideon
should
be
called
on
to
answer
to
the
charge
in
a
court
of
law
not
libelled
behind
his
back
i
said
i
hope
juke
happen
at
the
proper
time
meanwhile
i
must
ask
to
be
allowed
to
follow
my
own
methods
of
investigation
in
my
own
way
perhaps
you
forget
that
the
matter
concerns
the
tragic
death
of
my
very
dear
i
can
not
be
expected
to
let
things
rest
where
they
are
suppose
he
said
rising
as
i
rose
you
ca
i
added
as
a
parting
shot
is
always
open
to
gideon
to
bring
a
libel
action
against
any
one
who
falsely
and
publicly
accuses
him
he
assented
the
young
man
i
left
him
standing
there
and
turned
away
to
speak
to
creighton
who
was
passing
i
considered
that
juke
had
been
quite
in
his
rights
to
speak
to
me
as
he
had
done
and
i
was
not
offended
but
i
must
say
i
think
i
had
the
best
of
the
interview
and
it
left
me
with
the
strong
impression
that
he
knew
as
well
as
i
did
that
friend
gideon
would
in
no
circumstances
venture
to
bring
a
libel
action
against
any
one
in
this
matter
i
believed
that
the
young
clergyman
suspected
his
friend
himself
and
was
trying
in
vain
to
avert
from
him
the
nemesis
that
his
crime
deserved
clare
said
to
me
when
i
rejoined
her
did
juke
want
to
speak
to
you
about
mother
of
any
importance
dear
i
told
her
she
looked
at
me
in
the
rather
strange
troubled
frowning
way
she
has
now
sometimes
do
let
go
home
mother
she
said
suddenly
so
tired
and
i
do
believe
they
really
starving
a
bit
and
i
do
care
if
they
are
i
do
hate
bazaars
clare
used
once
to
be
quite
fond
of
them
but
she
seemed
to
hate
so
many
things
now
poor
child
i
took
her
home
and
that
evening
i
told
percy
about
my
interview
with
juke
libel
action
said
percy
be
excellent
the
very
thing
but
if
he
guilty
he
wo
bring
one
i
said
feel
it
is
our
duty
not
to
let
the
affair
drop
we
owe
it
to
poor
dear
oliver
even
now
he
may
be
looking
down
on
us
unable
to
rest
in
perfect
peace
till
he
is
avenged
may
he
may
my
dear
said
percy
nodding
his
head
know
do
you
never
know
anything
at
all
on
the
other
hand
he
may
have
lost
his
own
balance
as
they
decided
at
the
inquest
and
tumbled
downstairs
on
to
his
head
nasty
stairs
very
nasty
stairs
anyhow
if
gideon
shove
him
he
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
in
our
talk
and
if
he
did
have
to
face
the
music
troublesome
fellow
anyhow
that
paper
of
his
gets
worse
every
week
it
ought
to
be
muzzled
i
could
help
wondering
how
it
would
affect
the
if
its
editor
were
to
be
arrested
on
a
charge
of
wilful
murder
part
iv
told
by
katherine
varick
a
branch
of
study
people
are
very
odd
unreliable
and
irregular
in
their
actions
and
reactions
you
ca
count
on
them
as
you
can
on
chemicals
i
suppose
that
merely
means
that
one
does
know
them
so
well
they
are
far
harder
to
know
there
is
a
queer
element
of
muddle
about
them
that
baffles
one
you
never
know
when
greediness
the
main
element
in
most
of
us
will
stop
working
checked
by
something
else
some
finer
quite
different
motive
force
and
them
checking
that
again
comes
strong
emotion
such
as
love
or
hate
overthrowing
everything
and
making
chaos
of
course
you
may
say
these
interacting
forces
are
all
elements
that
should
be
known
and
reckoned
with
beforehand
and
it
is
quite
true
that
is
just
the
trouble
one
does
know
enough
though
i
do
study
human
nature
with
the
absorption
of
laurence
juke
after
all
it
his
trade
i
find
it
interesting
like
other
curious
branches
of
study
and
the
more
complex
and
unreliable
it
is
so
much
the
more
interesting
i
much
more
interested
for
instance
in
arthur
gideon
who
is
surprising
and
incalculable
than
in
jane
and
johnny
potter
who
are
pushed
along
almost
entirely
by
one
motive
greed
even
less
interested
in
jane
and
johnny
than
in
the
rest
of
their
family
who
are
the
usual
british
mixture
of
humbug
sentimentality
commercialism
and
genuine
feeling
they
represent
potterism
and
potterism
is
a
wonderful
thing
the
twins
are
far
too
to
be
potterites
in
that
sense
you
really
can
on
almost
any
occasion
say
how
they
will
act
so
they
are
rather
dull
as
a
study
though
amusing
enough
as
companions
but
arthur
gideon
is
full
of
twists
and
turns
and
surprises
he
is
one
of
those
rare
people
who
can
really
throw
their
whole
selves
into
a
cause
lose
themselves
for
it
and
not
care
jukie
says
that
christian
i
dare
say
it
is
it
is
certainly
seldom
enough
found
in
the
world
and
that
seems
to
be
an
essential
quality
of
all
the
christian
virtues
as
far
as
one
can
see
anyhow
arthur
passion
for
truth
his
passion
for
the
and
his
distaste
for
untruth
and
for
the
seemed
to
be
the
supreme
motive
forces
in
him
all
the
years
i
have
known
him
until
just
lately
and
then
something
else
came
in
apparently
stronger
than
these
forces
of
course
i
knew
a
long
time
ago
certainly
since
he
left
the
army
that
he
was
in
love
with
jane
i
knew
it
long
before
he
did
it
was
a
queer
feeling
for
it
went
on
apparently
side
by
side
with
impatience
and
scorn
of
her
and
it
grew
and
grew
jane
marriage
made
it
worse
she
worked
for
him
and
they
met
constantly
and
at
last
it
got
so
that
we
all
saw
it
and
all
the
time
he
did
like
her
because
she
was
and
commercial
and
he
was
and
an
artist
an
artist
in
the
sense
that
he
loved
things
for
what
they
were
not
for
what
he
could
get
out
of
them
jane
was
always
thinking
can
i
use
this
what
can
i
get
out
of
it
she
thought
it
about
the
war
so
did
johnny
she
has
always
thought
it
about
everything
it
is
in
her
not
to
and
arthur
knew
it
but
did
care
anyhow
he
loved
her
all
the
same
it
was
as
if
his
reason
and
judgment
were
bowled
over
by
her
charm
and
could
help
him
the
evening
after
oliver
hobart
death
arthur
came
in
to
see
me
about
nine
he
looked
extraordinarily
ill
and
strained
and
was
even
more
restless
and
jerky
than
usual
he
looked
as
if
he
slept
at
all
i
was
testing
some
calculations
and
he
sat
on
the
sofa
and
smoked
when
i
had
finished
he
said
what
your
view
of
this
business
of
course
i
knew
he
meant
oliver
hobart
death
and
how
it
would
affect
jane
one
says
exactly
what
one
thinks
to
arthur
so
i
said
a
good
thing
ultimately
for
jane
they
did
suit
i
clear
it
a
good
thing
in
the
end
are
you
he
made
a
sharp
movement
and
pushed
back
his
hair
from
his
forehead
i
clear
of
nothing
he
added
after
a
moment
that
the
way
looks
at
it
do
you
suppose
do
i
said
he
half
winced
why
why
the
devil
did
she
marry
the
poor
chap
there
was
an
odd
sort
of
appeal
in
his
voice
appeal
against
the
cruelty
of
fate
perhaps
or
the
perverseness
of
jane
i
told
him
what
i
thought
as
clearly
as
i
could
got
carried
away
by
the
excitement
of
her
life
in
paris
and
he
was
all
mixed
up
with
that
i
think
she
felt
she
would
in
a
way
be
carrying
on
the
excitement
and
the
life
if
she
married
him
and
she
was
knocked
over
by
his
beauty
then
when
the
haze
and
glamour
had
cleared
away
and
she
was
left
face
to
face
with
him
as
a
life
companion
she
found
she
could
do
with
him
after
all
he
bored
her
and
annoyed
her
more
and
more
i
do
know
how
long
she
could
have
gone
on
with
it
she
never
said
anything
to
me
about
it
but
now
this
has
happened
what
might
have
become
a
great
difficulty
is
solved
he
repeated
in
a
curious
dead
voice
staring
at
the
floor
suppose
it
is
he
was
silent
for
quite
five
minutes
sitting
quite
still
with
his
black
eyes
absent
and
vacant
as
if
he
were
very
tired
i
knew
he
was
trying
to
think
out
some
problem
and
i
supposed
i
knew
what
it
was
but
i
account
then
for
his
extreme
unhappiness
at
last
he
said
this
is
a
mess
i
ca
tell
you
about
it
but
it
is
a
mess
jane
and
i
are
in
a
mess
oh
you
guessed
have
you
about
jane
and
me
juke
guessed
i
guessed
that
before
jukie
did
before
you
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
did
but
he
was
much
interested
you
altogether
arthur
i
ca
see
it
a
mess
exactly
a
shock
of
course
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
adjusting
his
point
of
view
to
mine
no
you
would
see
it
of
course
but
there
more
to
this
than
you
know
much
more
anyhow
please
take
my
word
for
it
that
it
a
mess
a
ghastly
mess
i
took
his
word
for
it
as
there
did
seem
to
be
any
comment
to
make
i
made
none
but
waited
for
him
to
go
on
he
went
on
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
katherine
was
can
you
look
after
jane
a
little
she
need
it
she
needs
it
she
got
to
get
through
it
somehow
and
that
family
of
hers
always
buzzing
round
if
we
could
keep
lady
pinkerton
off
her
want
me
to
mix
a
poison
for
lady
p
i
suggested
arthur
must
have
been
very
far
through
for
he
actually
started
heaven
forbid
one
sudden
death
in
the
family
is
enough
at
a
time
he
added
feebly
trying
to
smile
i
said
do
my
best
to
see
after
jane
and
to
counteract
the
family
i
not
gone
there
or
written
or
anything
yet
because
i
did
want
to
butt
in
but
i
will
wish
she
come
back
here
and
live
with
you
he
said
to
soothe
him
i
said
i
would
ask
her
for
nearly
an
hour
longer
he
stayed
not
talking
much
but
smoking
hard
and
from
time
to
time
jerking
out
a
disconnected
remark
i
think
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
saying
or
doing
that
evening
he
seemed
dazed
and
i
noticed
that
his
hands
were
shaking
as
if
he
was
feverish
or
drunk
or
something
when
at
last
he
went
he
held
my
hand
and
wrung
it
so
that
it
hurt
this
was
unusual
too
because
we
never
do
shake
hands
we
meet
much
too
often
i
thought
it
over
and
could
quite
understand
it
all
it
even
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
a
little
potterish
of
arthur
to
make
a
conventional
tragic
situation
out
of
what
he
could
really
mind
very
much
and
to
make
out
that
jane
was
overwhelmed
by
what
i
believed
did
really
overwhelm
her
but
that
did
do
arthur
was
never
potterish
there
must
therefore
be
more
to
this
than
i
understood
unless
of
course
it
was
merely
that
arthur
was
afraid
of
the
effects
of
the
shock
and
so
on
on
jane
health
because
she
had
a
baby
coming
but
somehow
that
did
really
meet
the
situation
i
remembered
voice
when
he
said
more
to
it
than
you
know
it
a
mess
a
ghastly
mess
and
another
rather
queer
thing
i
remembered
was
that
all
through
the
evening
he
had
once
met
my
eyes
an
odd
thing
in
arthur
for
he
has
a
habit
of
looking
at
the
people
he
is
talking
to
very
straight
and
hard
as
if
to
hold
their
minds
to
his
by
his
eyes
well
i
supposed
that
in
about
a
year
those
two
would
marry
anyhow
and
then
they
would
talk
and
talk
and
talk
and
arthur
would
look
at
jane
not
only
because
he
was
talking
to
her
but
because
he
liked
to
look
at
her
they
would
be
all
right
then
so
why
should
i
bother
i
went
to
see
jane
but
found
lady
pinkerton
in
possession
i
saw
jane
for
five
minutes
alone
she
was
much
as
i
had
expected
calm
and
rather
silent
i
asked
her
to
come
round
to
the
flat
any
evening
she
could
she
came
next
week
and
after
that
got
into
the
way
of
dropping
in
pretty
often
both
in
the
evenings
when
i
was
at
home
and
during
the
day
when
i
was
at
the
laboratory
she
said
see
old
thing
mother
has
got
it
into
her
head
that
i
need
company
the
only
way
i
can
get
out
of
it
is
to
say
i
shall
be
here
mother
rather
much
just
now
she
got
the
other
side
on
the
brain
and
is
trying
to
put
me
in
touch
with
it
she
reads
me
books
called
from
the
other
and
across
the
and
so
on
and
she
talks
jane
pushed
back
her
hair
from
her
forehead
and
leant
her
head
on
her
hand
what
mother
calls
my
condition
she
went
on
do
think
i
ought
to
be
worried
do
you
i
wish
baby
would
come
at
once
so
that
i
should
be
in
a
condition
any
more
i
really
awfully
fond
of
baby
but
i
shall
get
to
hate
it
if
i
reminded
of
it
much
more
what
a
rotten
system
it
is
why
have
we
evolved
a
better
one
all
these
centuries
i
could
imagine
why
except
for
the
general
principle
that
as
the
mental
equipment
of
the
human
race
improves
its
physical
qualities
apparently
deteriorate
where
will
that
land
us
in
the
end
jane
speculated
we
be
a
race
of
clever
crocks
or
shall
we
give
up
civilisation
and
education
and
be
robust
imbeciles
i
said
be
an
improvement
on
the
present
régime
of
crocky
imbeciles
we
would
talk
like
that
of
things
in
general
in
the
old
way
jane
indeed
would
have
moods
in
which
she
would
talk
continuously
and
i
would
suddenly
think
watching
her
trying
to
hide
from
something
to
talk
it
down
and
then
one
evening
arthur
and
she
met
at
my
flat
jane
had
been
having
supper
with
me
and
arthur
dropped
in
jane
said
arthur
and
arthur
said
hallo
and
i
saw
plainly
that
the
last
person
either
had
wanted
to
meet
was
the
other
arthur
did
stay
at
all
he
said
he
had
come
to
speak
to
me
about
a
review
he
wanted
me
to
do
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
speak
to
me
about
it
at
all
he
had
already
sent
me
the
book
and
i
had
yet
read
it
and
it
was
on
a
subject
he
knew
nothing
at
all
about
and
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
say
however
he
succeeded
in
saying
something
then
went
away
jane
had
hardly
spoken
to
him
or
looked
at
him
she
was
reading
an
evening
paper
she
put
it
down
when
he
had
gone
arthur
come
in
often
she
asked
me
casually
lighting
another
cigarette
sometimes
after
a
minute
or
two
jane
said
here
k
i
tell
you
something
i
not
particularly
keen
on
meeting
arthur
for
the
present
nor
he
me
not
exactly
news
my
dear
it
fairly
stuck
out
just
now
did
it
well
the
fact
is
we
both
want
a
little
time
to
collect
ourselves
to
settle
how
we
stand
sudden
deaths
are
a
bad
jar
they
break
things
up
arthur
and
i
were
more
friends
than
oliver
liked
you
know
he
did
like
arthur
and
did
like
my
going
about
with
him
oh
well
you
know
all
that
as
well
as
i
do
of
course
and
now
he
dead
it
seems
to
spoil
things
a
bit
i
hate
meeting
arthur
now
and
then
an
extraordinary
thing
happened
jane
whom
i
had
never
seen
cry
broke
down
quite
suddenly
and
cried
of
course
it
would
have
seemed
quite
natural
in
most
people
but
tears
are
as
surprising
in
jane
as
they
would
be
in
me
they
are
part
of
her
equipment
however
she
was
out
of
health
just
now
of
course
and
had
had
a
bad
shock
and
was
emotionally
overwrought
and
anyhow
she
cried
i
mixed
her
some
sal
volatile
which
i
understand
is
done
in
these
crises
she
drank
it
and
stopped
crying
soon
to
be
such
an
ass
she
said
more
in
her
normal
tone
this
beastly
baby
i
suppose
well
look
here
k
you
see
what
i
mean
arthur
and
i
do
want
to
meet
just
now
if
he
likely
to
come
in
much
i
must
give
up
coming
that
all
tell
him
i
said
you
often
here
if
he
does
want
to
meet
you
either
that
ought
to
settle
it
old
thing
will
you
jane
was
the
perfect
egotist
if
it
ever
occurred
to
her
that
possibly
arthur
would
like
to
see
me
sometimes
and
i
him
she
would
not
think
it
mattered
she
wanted
to
come
to
my
flat
and
she
did
want
to
meet
arthur
therefore
arthur
must
come
life
little
difficulties
are
very
simply
arranged
by
the
potter
twins
then
for
nine
days
we
none
of
us
thought
or
talked
much
about
anything
but
the
railway
strike
the
strike
was
rather
like
the
war
the
same
old
cries
began
again
carrying
on
doing
one
bit
seeing
it
through
fighting
to
a
finish
enemy
atrocities
only
now
they
were
called
sabotage
starving
them
out
gallant
volunteers
the
indomitable
britisher
cheeriest
always
in
disaster
what
a
hideous
slander
innocent
women
and
children
i
never
understood
about
these
at
least
about
the
women
why
is
it
worse
that
women
should
suffer
than
men
as
to
innocence
they
have
no
more
of
that
than
men
i
not
innocent
particularly
nor
are
the
other
women
i
know
but
they
are
always
classed
with
children
as
sort
of
helpless
imbeciles
who
must
be
kept
from
danger
and
discomfort
i
got
sick
of
it
during
the
war
the
people
who
did
like
the
blockade
talked
about
starving
women
and
children
as
if
it
was
somehow
worse
that
women
should
starve
than
men
other
people
quite
other
talked
of
our
brave
soldiers
who
were
fighting
to
defend
the
women
and
children
of
their
country
or
the
dastardly
air
raids
that
killed
women
and
children
why
not
have
said
which
makes
sense
there
were
plenty
of
male
unfit
or
over
age
or
indispensable
and
it
was
quite
as
bad
that
they
should
be
killed
worse
i
suppose
when
they
were
indispensable
very
few
women
or
children
are
that
so
now
the
appeal
to
strikers
which
was
published
in
the
advertisement
columns
of
the
papers
at
the
expense
of
few
patriotic
said
bring
further
hardship
and
suffering
upon
the
innocent
women
and
children
save
the
women
and
children
from
the
terror
of
the
strike
fools
in
another
column
was
the
advertisement
and
that
was
worse
there
was
a
picture
of
a
railwayman
looking
like
a
consumptive
in
the
last
stages
and
embracing
one
of
his
horrible
children
while
his
more
horrible
wife
and
mother
supported
the
feeble
heads
of
others
and
under
it
was
written
this
man
an
anarchist
he
wants
a
wage
to
keep
his
family
and
it
was
awful
to
think
that
he
and
his
family
would
perhaps
get
the
wage
and
be
kept
after
all
the
question
about
whether
he
was
an
anarchist
was
obviously
unanswerable
without
further
data
as
there
was
nothing
in
the
picture
to
show
his
political
convictions
they
might
from
anything
that
appeared
have
been
liberal
tory
labour
socialist
anarchist
or
and
anyhow
supposing
that
he
had
been
an
anarchist
he
would
still
presumably
have
wanted
a
wage
to
keep
his
family
anarchists
are
people
who
disapprove
of
authority
not
of
wages
the
member
of
the
who
composed
that
picture
must
have
had
a
muddled
mind
but
so
many
people
have
and
so
many
people
use
words
in
an
odd
sense
that
you
ca
find
in
the
dictionary
bolshevist
for
instance
lloyd
george
called
the
strikers
bolshevists
so
did
plenty
of
other
people
none
of
them
seem
to
have
any
very
clear
conception
of
the
political
convictions
of
the
supporters
of
the
soviet
government
in
russia
to
have
that
you
would
need
to
think
and
read
a
little
whereas
to
use
the
word
as
a
vague
term
of
abuse
you
need
only
to
feel
which
many
people
find
much
easier
some
people
use
the
word
capitalist
in
the
same
way
as
a
term
of
abuse
meaning
really
only
person
if
they
stopped
to
think
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
they
would
remember
that
it
means
merely
a
person
who
uses
what
money
he
has
productively
instead
of
hoarding
it
in
a
stocking
but
and
were
both
flung
about
freely
during
the
strike
by
the
different
sides
emotional
unrest
i
suppose
people
get
excited
and
directly
they
get
excited
they
get
sentimental
and
confused
the
daily
press
did
on
both
sides
i
do
know
which
was
worse
the
pinkerton
press
blossomed
into
silly
about
noblemen
working
on
under
ground
trains
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
the
volunteer
workers
were
clerks
and
tradesmen
and
working
men
but
these
were
so
interesting
to
talk
about
i
suppose
the
became
more
than
ever
precise
and
pedantic
and
and
what
people
call
dull
it
did
take
sides
it
simply
gave
in
more
detail
than
any
other
paper
the
issues
and
the
account
of
the
negotiations
and
had
expert
articles
on
the
different
currents
of
influence
on
both
sides
it
did
distort
or
conceal
the
truth
in
either
direction
i
met
lady
pinkerton
one
evening
at
jane
she
would
of
course
come
up
to
town
though
the
amateur
trains
were
too
full
without
her
she
said
course
they
hate
us
they
want
a
class
war
jane
said
are
they
and
who
are
us
and
she
said
working
classes
of
course
they
always
hated
us
they
bolshevists
at
heart
they
wo
be
satisfied
till
they
robbed
us
of
all
we
have
they
hate
us
that
is
why
they
are
striking
we
must
crush
them
this
time
or
it
will
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
i
said
i
thought
they
were
striking
because
they
wanted
the
principle
of
standardisation
of
rates
of
wages
for
men
in
the
same
grade
to
be
applied
to
other
grades
than
drivers
and
firemen
lady
pinkerton
was
bored
i
imagine
she
understands
about
hate
and
love
and
envy
and
greed
and
determination
and
other
emotions
but
not
much
about
rates
of
wages
so
she
likes
to
talk
about
one
but
not
about
the
other
all
for
instance
that
she
knows
about
bolshevism
is
its
sentimental
side
how
it
is
against
the
rich
and
wants
to
nationalise
women
and
murder
the
upper
classes
she
does
know
about
any
of
the
aspects
of
the
bolshevist
constitution
beyond
those
which
she
can
take
in
through
her
emotions
she
would
find
the
others
dull
as
she
finds
technical
wage
questions
that
partly
why
she
hates
the
if
she
happened
to
be
on
the
other
side
she
would
talk
the
same
tosh
only
use
for
she
said
whatever
the
issue
the
blood
of
the
country
is
up
we
must
fight
the
thing
through
it
is
splendid
the
way
the
upper
classes
are
stepping
into
the
breach
on
the
railways
i
honour
them
i
only
hope
they
wo
all
be
murdered
by
these
despicable
brutes
that
was
the
way
she
talked
plenty
of
people
did
on
both
sides
especially
i
am
afraid
innocent
women
i
suppose
they
were
too
innocent
to
talk
about
facts
after
all
the
country
did
have
to
fight
the
thing
through
for
very
long
and
there
were
no
murders
for
the
strike
ended
on
october
the
that
same
week
jukie
came
in
to
see
me
jukie
does
often
come
because
his
evenings
are
apt
to
be
full
a
parson
work
seems
to
be
like
a
woman
never
done
from
to
seems
to
be
one
of
the
great
times
for
doing
it
probably
jukie
had
to
cut
some
of
it
the
evening
he
came
round
to
gough
square
i
always
like
to
see
jukie
he
entertaining
and
knows
about
such
queer
things
that
none
of
the
rest
of
us
know
and
believes
such
incredible
things
that
none
of
the
rest
of
us
believe
besides
like
arthur
all
out
on
his
job
he
still
touchingly
full
of
faith
even
after
all
that
has
and
has
happened
in
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
he
believed
at
that
time
that
the
league
of
nations
was
going
to
kill
war
that
the
labour
party
were
going
to
kill
industrial
inequity
that
the
country
was
going
to
kill
the
coalition
government
that
the
christian
church
was
going
to
kill
selfishness
that
some
one
was
going
to
kill
horatio
bottomley
and
that
we
were
all
going
to
kill
potterism
a
perfect
orgy
of
murders
as
arthur
said
and
all
of
them
so
improbable
jukie
is
curate
in
a
slummy
parish
near
covent
garden
he
succeeds
apparently
in
really
being
friends
equal
and
intimate
friends
with
a
lot
of
the
men
in
his
parish
which
is
queer
for
a
person
of
his
kind
i
suppose
he
learnt
how
while
he
was
in
the
ranks
he
deserved
to
arthur
told
me
that
he
had
persistently
refused
promotion
because
he
wanted
to
go
on
living
with
the
men
and
that
not
a
soft
job
from
all
accounts
especially
for
a
clean
and
person
like
jukie
of
course
he
very
popular
because
he
very
attractive
and
of
course
spoilt
him
a
little
i
never
knew
a
very
popular
and
attractive
person
who
was
a
little
spoilt
by
it
and
in
jukie
case
it
a
pity
because
he
too
good
for
that
sort
of
thing
but
it
has
really
damaged
him
much
he
came
in
that
evening
saying
i
want
to
speak
to
you
and
sat
down
looking
rather
worried
and
solemn
he
plunged
into
it
at
once
as
he
always
does
you
heard
any
talk
lately
about
gideon
he
asked
me
more
interesting
than
usual
i
said
i
seldom
hear
talk
i
do
mix
enough
we
do
gossip
much
in
the
lab
you
know
i
look
to
you
and
my
fleet
street
friends
for
spicy
personal
items
what
the
latest
about
arthur
this
he
said
are
going
about
saying
that
he
pushed
hobart
downstairs
i
felt
then
as
if
i
had
known
all
along
that
of
course
people
were
saying
that
why
is
he
arrested
i
asked
stupidly
probably
will
be
before
long
said
jukie
no
evidence
yet
to
arrest
him
on
at
present
it
merely
talk
started
by
that
pinkerton
woman
and
sneaking
about
from
person
to
person
in
the
devilish
way
such
talk
does
i
was
with
gideon
yesterday
and
saw
two
people
cut
him
dead
you
see
it
all
so
horribly
plausible
every
one
knows
they
hated
each
other
and
had
just
quarrelled
and
it
seems
he
was
there
that
night
just
before
it
happened
he
went
home
with
jane
i
remembered
that
they
had
left
my
place
together
but
neither
arthur
nor
jane
had
told
me
that
he
had
gone
home
with
her
inquest
said
it
was
accidental
i
said
protesting
against
something
i
did
quite
know
what
jukie
shrugged
his
shoulders
not
very
likely
to
stop
people
talking
he
added
after
a
moment
it
got
to
be
stopped
somehow
i
went
to
an
awful
bazaar
this
afternoon
on
purpose
to
meet
that
woman
i
met
her
i
spoke
to
her
i
told
her
to
chuck
it
she
as
good
as
told
me
she
was
going
to
i
mentioned
the
libel
law
she
practically
dared
gideon
to
use
it
against
her
she
means
to
go
on
she
poisoning
the
air
with
her
horrible
whispers
and
slanders
why
ca
some
one
choke
her
what
can
we
do
about
it
that
the
question
ought
one
of
us
to
tell
gideon
i
inclined
to
think
we
ought
you
sure
he
does
know
it
already
i
not
sure
gideon
knows
most
things
but
the
person
concerned
is
usually
the
last
to
hear
such
talk
and
in
case
he
has
no
suspicion
i
think
we
should
tell
him
get
him
to
issue
through
the
a
declaration
that
the
whole
story
is
a
tissue
of
lies
then
i
wished
i
had
used
that
particular
phrase
it
was
an
unfortunate
one
it
suggested
a
similarity
between
lady
pinkerton
story
and
bullitt
between
arthur
gideon
denial
and
lloyd
george
jukie
eyes
met
mine
swiftly
not
dreamy
and
introspective
as
usual
but
keen
and
thoughtful
he
said
may
as
well
have
this
out
it
wo
hurt
gideon
here
it
a
lie
i
believe
so
but
frankly
i
do
feel
certain
i
do
know
what
to
think
do
you
i
considered
it
looking
at
it
all
ways
the
recent
past
attitude
and
jane
were
all
lit
up
by
this
horrible
flare
of
light
which
was
turned
upon
them
i
said
at
last
do
know
either
we
ca
assume
for
certain
that
it
is
a
lie
jukie
let
out
a
long
breath
and
leant
forward
in
his
chair
resting
his
head
on
his
hands
old
gideon
he
said
might
have
happened
without
any
intention
on
his
part
if
hobart
found
him
there
with
jane
and
if
they
quarrelled
gideon
got
a
quick
temper
and
hobart
always
made
him
see
red
he
might
have
hit
him
pushed
him
down
without
meaning
to
injure
him
and
then
it
would
be
done
and
then
if
he
did
it
he
must
have
left
the
house
at
once
perhaps
not
knowing
he
killed
him
perhaps
he
did
know
till
afterwards
and
then
jane
might
have
asked
him
not
to
say
anything
i
do
know
i
do
know
perhaps
nonsense
perhaps
it
a
tissue
of
lies
i
hope
to
god
it
is
i
only
know
one
thing
that
makes
me
even
suspect
it
may
be
true
and
that
is
that
gideon
has
been
absolutely
miserable
and
gone
about
like
a
man
half
stunned
ever
since
it
happened
he
shot
the
question
at
me
hoping
i
had
some
answer
but
i
had
none
i
shook
my
head
said
jukie
sadly
is
i
suppose
our
business
whether
he
did
or
did
do
it
that
between
him
and
himself
but
it
our
business
whether
he
innocent
or
guilty
to
put
him
on
his
guard
against
this
talk
it
for
you
or
me
to
do
that
katherine
will
you
you
like
rather
you
did
it
if
you
will
i
think
he
less
likely
to
think
that
you
trying
to
find
things
out
you
see
i
warned
him
once
before
about
another
thing
and
he
might
think
i
was
linking
it
in
my
mind
with
that
jane
i
said
and
he
nodded
with
jane
i
spoke
to
him
about
jane
a
few
days
before
it
happened
i
thought
it
might
be
some
use
but
i
think
it
only
made
things
worse
i
rather
leave
this
to
you
unless
you
hate
it
too
much
oh
it
all
pretty
sickening
is
it
gideon
in
this
sort
of
mess
gideon
the
best
of
the
lot
of
us
you
see
even
if
it
all
moonshine
about
hobart
as
i
quite
prepared
to
believe
it
probably
is
he
gone
and
given
plausibility
to
the
yarn
by
falling
in
love
with
hobart
wife
nothing
can
get
round
that
why
could
he
have
chucked
it
gone
away
anything
when
he
felt
it
coming
on
a
strong
fine
keen
person
like
that
to
be
bowled
over
by
his
sloppy
emotions
and
dragged
through
the
mud
like
any
beastly
sensualist
or
like
one
of
my
own
cheery
relations
i
rather
he
done
hobart
in
there
have
been
some
sense
about
that
if
he
had
after
all
it
would
have
been
striking
a
blow
against
potterism
only
if
he
did
do
it
it
would
be
more
like
him
to
face
the
music
and
own
to
it
what
i
ca
fit
into
the
picture
is
gideon
sneaking
away
in
the
dark
afraid
oh
well
it
not
my
business
katherine
you
do
it
at
once
wo
you
ring
him
up
and
get
him
to
dine
with
you
or
something
if
any
way
of
stopping
that
poisonous
woman
tongue
we
find
it
meanwhile
i
shall
tell
our
parish
workers
that
leila
yorke
works
are
obscene
and
that
they
not
to
read
them
to
mother
meetings
as
is
their
habit
i
sat
up
till
midnight
wondering
how
on
earth
i
was
going
to
put
it
to
arthur
i
did
dine
with
arthur
i
thought
it
would
last
too
long
and
that
he
might
want
me
to
go
and
that
i
should
certainly
want
to
go
after
i
had
said
what
i
had
to
say
so
i
rang
him
up
at
the
office
and
asked
if
he
could
lunch
not
at
the
club
it
too
full
of
people
we
know
who
keep
interrupting
and
who
would
be
tremendously
edified
at
catching
murmurs
about
libel
and
murder
and
lady
pinkerton
being
poisoned
so
i
said
the
temple
bar
restaurant
in
fleet
street
a
disagreeable
place
but
so
noisy
and
crowded
that
you
can
say
what
you
like
unheard
unheard
very
often
by
the
person
you
are
addressing
and
certainly
by
every
one
else
we
sat
downstairs
at
a
table
at
the
back
and
there
i
told
him
in
what
hardly
needed
to
be
an
undertone
of
the
rumours
that
were
being
circulated
about
him
i
felt
like
a
horrid
woman
in
a
village
who
repeats
spiteful
gossip
and
says
telling
you
because
i
think
you
ought
to
know
what
being
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
was
the
one
and
only
case
i
have
ever
come
across
in
which
i
have
thought
the
person
concerned
ought
to
know
what
was
being
said
as
a
rule
it
seems
the
last
thing
they
ought
to
know
he
listened
staring
at
the
tablecloth
and
crumbling
his
bread
you
he
said
telling
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
knew
or
anyhow
guessed
but
i
not
sure
that
anything
can
be
done
to
stop
it
i
said
looking
away
from
him
could
find
grounds
for
a
libel
action
you
might
ask
a
lawyer
he
returned
quickly
quite
impossible
out
of
the
question
there
are
no
grounds
and
i
would
if
there
were
i
not
going
to
have
the
thing
made
a
show
of
in
the
courts
it
exactly
what
the
pinkertons
would
enjoy
a
pinkerton
scoop
no
i
shall
let
it
alone
there
no
way
of
stopping
it
then
i
asked
one
he
murmured
absently
beneath
his
breath
then
caught
himself
up
do
know
i
think
not
i
did
make
any
further
suggestions
what
was
the
good
of
advising
him
to
remonstrate
with
the
pinkertons
if
they
were
lying
it
was
the
obvious
course
if
they
were
it
was
an
impossible
one
i
let
it
alone
arthur
was
frowning
as
he
ate
cold
beef
one
thing
he
said
jane
know
what
is
being
said
do
you
suppose
her
parents
have
talked
about
it
to
her
i
said
i
did
know
and
he
went
on
frowning
then
he
murdered
a
wasp
with
his
knife
a
horrible
habit
at
meals
but
one
practised
by
many
returned
soldiers
who
kill
all
too
readily
i
suppose
after
killing
all
those
germans
and
possibly
oliver
hobart
a
wasp
seems
nothing
he
said
absently
when
he
was
through
with
the
wasp
know
i
do
know
and
he
seemed
somehow
helpless
and
desperate
as
if
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
tether
must
think
it
over
he
said
and
then
he
suddenly
began
to
talk
about
something
else
arthur
manner
troubled
rather
than
indignant
had
been
against
him
he
had
dismissed
the
idea
of
a
libel
action
and
not
proposed
to
confront
his
libellers
in
a
personal
interview
every
circumstance
seemed
against
him
i
knew
that
as
i
walked
back
to
the
laboratory
after
lunch
and
yet
and
yet
well
perhaps
as
jukie
would
say
it
was
my
business
my
business
at
the
moment
was
to
carry
on
investigations
into
the
action
of
carbohydrates
arthur
gideon
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
nor
i
with
his
private
slayings
if
any
i
wrote
to
jukie
that
evening
and
told
him
i
had
warned
arthur
who
apparently
knew
already
what
was
being
said
but
did
seem
to
be
contemplating
taking
any
steps
about
it
so
that
was
that
or
so
i
thought
at
the
time
but
it
was
because
when
i
had
posted
my
letter
to
jukie
and
sat
alone
in
my
room
smoking
and
thinking
at
last
with
leisure
to
open
my
mind
to
all
the
impressions
and
implications
of
the
day
i
have
time
for
this
in
the
laboratory
i
began
to
fumble
for
and
find
a
new
clue
to
arthur
recent
oddness
for
hours
i
had
believed
that
he
had
perhaps
killed
oliver
hobart
now
suddenly
i
did
but
i
was
clear
that
there
was
something
about
oliver
death
which
concerned
him
touched
him
nearly
and
after
a
moment
it
occurred
to
me
what
it
might
be
suspects
that
jane
did
it
i
said
slowly
and
aloud
trying
to
shield
her
with
that
everything
that
had
seemed
odd
about
the
business
became
suddenly
clear
arthur
troubled
strangeness
jane
dread
of
meeting
him
her
determined
avoidance
of
any
reference
to
that
night
her
sudden
fit
of
crying
arthur
shrinking
from
the
idea
of
giving
the
talk
against
him
publicity
by
a
libel
action
his
question
jane
know
his
remark
to
himself
that
there
was
only
one
way
of
stopping
it
that
one
way
of
course
would
be
to
make
jane
tell
her
parents
the
truth
so
that
they
would
be
silenced
for
ever
as
it
was
the
talk
might
go
on
and
at
last
official
investigations
might
be
started
which
would
lead
somehow
to
the
exposure
of
the
whole
affair
the
exposure
would
probably
take
the
form
of
a
public
admission
by
jane
i
did
think
she
would
stand
by
and
see
arthur
accused
without
speaking
out
so
i
formed
my
theory
it
was
the
merest
speculation
of
course
but
it
was
obvious
that
there
was
something
in
the
manner
of
oliver
death
which
badly
troubled
and
disturbed
both
arthur
and
jane
that
being
so
and
taking
into
account
their
estrangement
from
one
another
it
was
difficult
not
to
be
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
one
of
them
knew
or
anyhow
guessed
the
other
to
have
caused
the
accident
and
knowing
them
both
as
i
did
i
believed
that
if
arthur
had
done
it
he
would
have
owned
to
it
would
one
own
to
it
if
one
had
knocked
a
man
downstairs
in
a
quarrel
and
killed
him
to
keep
it
dark
would
seem
somehow
cheap
and
timid
not
in
arthur
line
unless
jane
had
asked
him
to
unless
it
was
for
her
sake
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
thing
to
do
was
to
go
straight
to
jane
and
tell
her
what
was
being
said
if
she
did
choose
to
do
anything
about
it
that
was
her
business
but
i
was
determined
she
should
know
an
hour
later
i
was
in
jane
jane
was
sitting
at
her
and
the
room
was
dim
except
for
the
light
from
the
that
made
a
soft
bright
circle
round
her
head
and
shoulders
she
turned
round
when
i
came
in
and
said
what
an
unusual
hour
you
must
have
something
very
important
to
say
old
thing
have
rather
i
said
and
sat
down
by
her
this
jane
do
you
know
that
people
are
saying
spreading
it
about
that
arthur
killed
your
husband
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
room
for
a
moment
i
heard
nothing
but
the
ticking
of
a
small
silver
clock
on
the
jane
sat
quite
still
and
stared
at
me
not
surprised
not
angry
not
shocked
but
with
a
queer
dazed
blind
look
that
reminded
me
of
arthur
own
then
i
started
because
some
one
in
the
farther
shadows
of
the
room
drew
a
long
quivering
breath
and
said
on
a
soft
note
looking
round
i
saw
clare
potter
she
had
just
got
up
from
a
chair
and
was
standing
clutching
its
back
with
one
hand
looking
pale
and
sick
as
if
she
was
going
to
faint
i
had
of
course
known
clare
was
there
or
i
would
have
said
anything
but
i
was
rather
irritated
after
all
it
was
her
business
and
i
thought
it
rather
absurd
the
way
she
kept
up
her
attitude
of
not
being
able
to
bear
to
hear
oliver
hobart
death
mentioned
i
got
up
to
go
after
all
i
had
nothing
more
to
say
i
did
want
to
stop
and
pry
only
to
let
jane
know
but
as
i
turned
to
go
i
remembered
that
i
had
one
more
thing
to
say
was
lady
pinkerton
who
started
it
and
who
is
keeping
it
up
i
told
jane
you
somehow
stop
her
jane
still
stared
at
me
stupidly
after
a
moment
she
half
whispered
slowly
do
know
i
stood
looking
at
her
for
a
second
then
i
went
without
any
more
words
all
the
way
home
i
saw
those
two
white
faces
staring
at
me
and
heard
jane
whisper
do
know
i
did
know
either
i
only
knew
that
evening
one
thing
that
i
hated
jane
who
had
got
arthur
into
this
mess
and
know
whether
she
could
get
him
out
of
it
or
not
and
i
may
as
well
end
what
i
have
got
to
tell
by
saying
something
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
apparent
to
other
people
but
which
anyhow
it
would
be
potterish
humbug
on
my
part
to
try
to
hide
for
the
last
five
years
i
had
cared
for
arthur
gideon
more
than
for
any
one
else
in
the
world
i
saw
no
reason
why
i
should
if
i
liked
it
has
never
damaged
any
one
but
myself
it
has
damaged
me
in
two
ways
it
has
made
it
sometimes
difficult
to
give
my
mind
to
my
work
and
it
has
made
me
often
rather
degradingly
jealous
of
jane
however
you
would
hardly
i
hope
notice
it
and
anyhow
it
ca
be
helped
part
v
told
by
juke
in
his
private
journal
giving
advice
it
is
always
rather
amusing
dining
at
aylesbury
house
with
my
stimulating
family
especially
since
chloe
my
present
stepmother
entered
it
three
years
ago
chloe
is
great
fun
much
more
entertaining
than
most
variety
artists
i
know
plenty
of
these
because
wycombe
my
eldest
brother
introduces
them
to
me
as
a
class
they
seem
pleasant
and
but
a
little
crude
and
lacking
in
the
subtler
forms
of
wit
or
understanding
after
an
hour
or
so
of
their
company
i
want
to
yawn
but
chloe
keeps
me
going
she
is
vulgar
but
racy
she
is
also
very
kind
to
me
and
insists
on
coming
down
to
help
with
theatrical
entertainments
in
the
parish
it
is
so
decent
of
her
that
i
ca
say
no
though
she
does
really
fit
in
awfully
well
with
the
people
and
the
marlowe
society
people
and
the
others
whom
i
get
down
for
theatricals
in
fact
elizabethan
drama
is
really
her
touch
however
the
parish
prefers
chloe
i
need
hardly
say
i
dined
there
on
chloe
birthday
october
when
we
always
have
a
family
gathering
family
and
other
but
the
family
is
heterogeneous
enough
to
make
quite
a
good
party
in
itself
it
was
represented
on
that
particular
evening
by
my
father
and
chloe
my
young
sister
diana
my
brothers
wycombe
and
tony
tony
wife
myself
my
uncle
monsignor
juke
my
aunt
the
marchesa
centurione
and
a
daughter
and
my
aunt
cynthia
who
had
recently
on
her
own
fiftieth
birthday
come
out
of
a
convent
in
which
she
had
spent
years
and
was
preparing
to
see
life
besides
the
family
there
were
two
or
three
theatrical
friends
of
chloe
and
two
friends
of
my
father
a
youngish
literary
man
called
bryan
and
the
cabinet
minister
to
whom
tony
was
secretary
but
whom
i
will
not
name
because
he
might
not
care
for
it
to
be
generally
known
that
he
was
an
inmate
of
so
fast
a
household
my
aunt
cynthia
having
renounced
her
vows
and
having
only
a
comparatively
short
time
in
which
to
enjoy
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
is
making
the
most
of
it
she
has
only
been
out
of
her
convent
a
year
but
is
already
a
spring
of
invaluable
personal
information
about
men
and
manners
she
knows
everything
that
is
being
said
of
everybody
else
and
quite
a
lot
that
has
even
got
as
far
as
that
her
church
interests
undiminished
in
keenness
provide
a
store
of
tales
inaccessible
to
most
of
my
family
and
their
set
except
my
uncle
ferdinand
of
course
and
his
are
mostly
roman
not
anglican
aunt
cynthia
has
a
string
of
wonderful
stories
about
cowley
fathers
biting
nestorian
bishops
and
athelstan
riley
pinching
hensley
henson
and
so
forth
she
is
as
good
as
ronnie
knox
at
producing
or
inventing
them
not
bad
myself
when
i
like
but
aunt
cynthia
leaves
me
out
of
sight
this
evening
she
was
full
of
vim
she
usually
talks
at
the
top
of
a
very
high
and
strident
voice
i
do
know
what
they
did
with
it
at
the
convent
and
i
suddenly
heard
her
screaming
to
the
cabinet
minister
you
heard
oh
everybody
quoting
it
in
fleet
street
are
they
bryan
but
i
suppose
you
never
go
to
fleet
street
blank
it
so
important
is
it
for
the
government
not
to
get
mixed
up
with
the
press
well
i
tell
it
you
was
a
young
journalist
yid
of
his
foes
of
the
press
he
got
rid
in
ways
brief
and
bright
for
at
dead
of
the
night
he
threw
them
downstairs
so
he
did
it
about
the
late
editor
of
the
and
gideon
of
the
no
i
do
know
who
responsible
for
it
but
i
believe
it
perfectly
true
they
saying
so
everywhere
now
i
believe
that
awful
pinkerton
woman
is
going
about
saying
she
has
conclusive
evidence
it
been
revealed
from
the
beyond
i
believe
i
expect
by
poor
hobart
himself
no
i
sure
she
did
make
the
limerick
she
not
a
poet
only
a
novelist
perhaps
it
came
from
the
beyond
through
planchette
anyhow
they
say
gideon
will
be
arrested
on
a
murder
charge
very
shortly
and
that
there
no
doubt
he
guilty
i
leant
across
the
table
saying
so
aunt
cynthia
i
asked
her
aunt
cynthia
hates
being
asked
that
about
her
stories
of
course
every
one
does
i
do
myself
aunt
cynthia
looked
at
me
with
her
childlike
convent
stare
dear
laurie
how
can
i
remember
who
says
anything
with
every
one
saying
everything
all
the
time
who
why
all
sorts
of
people
they
chloe
chloe
who
was
showing
a
spoon
and

of
the
gentlemen

he
hated

and
his
paper
like
poison
the
so
different

every
one
clear

did
it
mind

do
blame

vulgar

dear
friend
of
laurie

in
wycombe

be
careful
aunt
cynthia
laurie

my
aunt
cried
tactless
of
me
but
my
dear
boy

really
friends
with
a
jew
and
you
a
christian
priest
friends
with
gideon

a
gentile
by
religion
by
the
way
an
ordinary
agnostic
aunt
cynthia
do
go
on
spreading
that
nonsense
if
you
do
mind
you
might
contradict
it
if
you
hear
it
again
well
dear
i
say
you
have
good
reason
to
know
it
is
true
i
say

been
told
who
did
kill
hobart
only
it
was
under
the
seal
so
you
ca
say
shall
i
all
means
if
you
like
then
aunt
cynthia
chased
off
after
another
exciting
subject
and
that
was
all
about
gideon
i
came
away
early
about
eleven
that
is
which
is
very
early
for
one
of
chloe
evenings
which
do
end
till
summer
dawn
feeling
more
worried
than
ever
about
gideon
if
the
gossip
about
him
had
penetrated
from
lady
pinkerton
circle
to
my
aunt
it
must
be
pretty
widespread
i
was
angry
with
aunt
cynthia
and
a
little
with
every
one
i
had
met
that
evening
they
were
so
cheerful
so
content
with
things
as
they
were
finding
all
the
world
such
a
screaming
farce
i
sometimes
get
my
family
on
my
nerves
when
i
go
there
straight
from
covent
garden
and
its
slum
babies
and
see
them
spending
and
squandering
and
being
irresponsible
and
dissolute
and
not
caring
twopence
for
the
way
of
the
world
live
there
was
wycombe
with
a
long
story
to
tell
me
about
his
debts
and
his
amours
he
going
to
be
in
a
divorce
case
directly
and
chloe
as
hard
as
nails
beneath
her
pretty
ways
and
simply
out
for
a
good
time
and
aunt
cynthia
with
half
the
gossip
of
london
spouting
out
of
her
like
a
geyser
and
diana
who
might
turn
out
fine
beyond
description
or
degenerate
into
a
mere
selfish
rake
it
wo
be
my
father
and
fault
if
she
does
do
the
latter
and
my
uncle
ferdinand
in
purple
and
fine
linen
a
prince
of
the
church
and
tony
already
booked
for
a
political
career
with
his
chief
shady
secrets
in
his
keeping
to
show
him
the
way
it
done
and
they
bandied
about
among
them
the
name
of
a
man
who
was
worth
the
lot
of
them
together
and
repeated
silly
rhymes
which
might
hang
him
it
was
a
little
more
than
i
could
stand
one
is
so
queer
about
one
family
i
inclined
to
think
every
one
is
often
i
fit
in
with
mine
perfectly
and
love
to
see
them
and
find
them
immensely
refreshing
after
covent
garden
and
parish
shop
and
then
another
time
they
be
on
my
nerves
and
i
feel
glad
i
out
of
it
all
and
another
time
again
i
jealous
of
them
and
wish
i
had
wycombe
or
tony
chances
of
doing
something
in
the
world
other
than
what
i
am
doing
that
of
course
is
sheer
vulgar
covetousness
and
grab
it
comes
on
sometimes
when
i
am
tired
or
bored
and
the
parish
seems
stale
and
the
conferences
and
committees
i
attend
unutterably
profitless
and
i
want
more
clever
people
to
talk
to
and
bigger
and
more
educated
audiences
to
preach
to
and
i
want
to
have
leisure
to
write
more
and
to
make
a
name
it
is
merely
a
vulgar
disease
a
form
of
potterism
one
has
to
face
it
and
fight
it
out
but
i
was
feeling
that
i
was
feeling
anything
very
much
except
that
gideon
and
all
that
gideon
stood
for
was
worth
immeasurably
more
than
anything
the
aylesbury
lot
had
ever
stood
for
and
when
i
got
back
i
found
a
note
from
katherine
saying
that
she
had
warned
gideon
about
the
talk
and
that
he
was
proposing
to
take
any
steps
next
morning
i
had
to
go
to
church
house
for
a
meeting
i
got
the
which
i
seldom
see
to
read
in
the
underground
on
the
front
page
side
by
side
with
murders
suicides
divorces
allied
notes
and
sinn
fein
outrages
was
a
paragraph
headed
hobart
mystery
suspicion
of
foul
play
it
was
about
how
hobart
sudden
death
had
never
been
adequately
investigated
and
how
curious
and
suspicious
circumstances
had
of
late
been
discovered
in
connection
with
it
and
inquiries
were
being
pursued
and
the
which
was
naturally
specially
interested
hoped
to
give
more
news
very
soon
so
old
pinkerton
was
making
a
journalistic
scoop
of
it
of
course
one
might
have
known
he
would
at
my
meeting
pulpit
exchange
it
was
about
i
met
frank
potter
he
is
a
queer
chap
commercial
and
grasping
like
all
his
family
and
dull
too
and
used
to
talk
one
sick
about
how
little
scope
he
had
in
his
parish
and
so
on
since
he
got
to
agatha
he
cheered
up
a
bit
and
talks
to
me
now
instead
of
his
big
congregations
and
their
fat
purses
he
a
creature
rather
stupid
and
entirely
conventional
he
all
against
pulpit
exchange
of
course
he
thinks
it
would
be
out
of
order
and
tradition
so
it
would
and
he
a
long
way
keener
on
order
and
tradition
than
he
is
on
spiritual
progress
a
born
pharisee
he
is
really
and
yet
with
christianity
struggling
in
him
here
and
there
and
that
why
he
rather
interesting
in
spite
of
his
dullness
after
the
meeting
i
went
up
to
him
and
showed
him
the
this
be
stopped
i
asked
him
he
blinked
at
it
what
johnny
is
up
in
arms
against
too
he
said
swears
by
this
chap
who
is
suspected
and
wo
hear
a
word
against
him
i
said
question
is
can
johnny
or
any
one
else
do
anything
to
stop
it
i
tried
i
spoke
to
lady
pinkerton
the
other
day
it
was
no
use
can
do
anything
afraid
not
he
said
rather
apathetically
see
my
people
believe
gideon
killed
hobart
and
are
determined
to
press
the
matter
one
ca
blame
them
you
know
if
they
really
think
that
my
mother
feels
perfectly
sure
of
it
from
various
bits
of
evidence
she
got
hold
of
and
wo
be
happy
till
the
thing
is
thoroughly
sifted
of
course
if
gideon
innocent
it
best
for
him
too
to
have
the
thing
out
now
it
got
so
far
do
you
agree
do
why
should
a
man
have
to
waste
his
time
appearing
in
a
criminal
court
to
answer
to
a
charge
of
manslaughter
or
murder
which
he
never
committed
gideon
happens
to
have
other
things
to
do
than
to
make
a
nine
days
wonder
for
the
press
and
public
i
suppose
that
annoyed
potter
rather
he
said
sharply
up
to
the
chap
to
prove
his
innocence
till
he
does
a
great
many
people
will
believe
him
guilty
i
afraid
yourself
obviously
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
prejudices
either
way
he
returned
his
emphasis
on
the
personal
pronoun
indicating
that
i
in
his
opinion
had
but
there
he
was
wrong
i
had
i
was
quite
prepared
to
believe
that
gideon
had
knocked
hobart
downstairs
or
that
he
had
you
ca
be
a
parson
or
indeed
anything
else
for
long
without
learning
that
decent
men
and
women
will
do
at
times
quite
indecent
things
and
that
the
devil
is
quite
strong
enough
to
make
a
mess
of
any
human
being
life
you
hear
of
a
man
that
he
was
in
love
with
another
man
wife
and
hated
her
husband
and
at
last
killed
him
in
a
quarrel
and
you
think
bad
lot
but
he
may
not
be
a
bad
lot
at
all
he
may
be
a
decent
chap
full
of
ideals
and
generosity
and
fine
thinking
sometimes
i
inclined
to
agree
with
the
author
of
that
gushing
and
hysterical
book
darkest
christendom
and
a
way
that
the
only
unforgiveable
sin
is
exploitation
exploitation
of
human
needs
and
human
weaknesses
and
human
tragedies
for
one
own
profit
and
as
we
very
nearly
all
do
it
in
one
way
or
another
let
us
hope
that
even
that
is
quite
unforgiveable
yes
we
nearly
all
do
it
the
press
exploits
for
its
benefit
human
silliness
and
ignorance
and
vulgarity
and
sensationalism
and
in
exploiting
it
feeds
it
the
war
profiteers
exploited
the
war
we
all
exploit
other
people
use
their
affection
their
dependence
on
us
their
needs
and
their
sins
for
our
own
ends
and
that
is
deliberate
to
knock
a
fellow
human
being
downstairs
in
a
quarrel
so
that
he
dies
that
may
be
impulse
and
accident
and
is
not
so
vile
even
to
say
nothing
afterwards
even
that
is
not
so
vile
still
i
would
rather
much
rather
think
that
gideon
had
done
it
it
was
odd
that
as
i
was
thinking
these
things
walking
up
surrey
street
from
the
temple
embankment
i
overtook
gideon
who
was
slouching
along
in
his
usual
abstracted
way
i
touched
his
arm
and
spoke
to
him
he
gave
me
his
queer
smile
jukie
where
are
you
bound
by
the
way
did
you
by
chance
see
the
this
morning
by
chance
that
does
happen
with
me
and
the
but
i
saw
it
obviously
mean
business
do
they
the
touch
i
expect
to
be
asked
for
my
photograph
soon
for
the
and
the
i
must
get
a
nice
one
taken
i
suppose
i
looked
as
i
felt
for
he
said
in
a
different
tone
worry
old
man
there
nothing
to
be
done
we
must
just
let
this
thing
take
its
course
i
could
say
anything
because
there
was
nothing
to
say
that
seem
like
asking
him
questions
or
trying
to
make
him
admit
or
deny
the
thing
to
me
i
wanted
to
ask
him
if
he
could
produce
an
alibi
and
blow
the
ridiculous
story
to
the
four
winds
but
suppose
he
could
so
i
said
nothing
but
let
me
know
if
ever
i
can
be
any
use
and
we
parted
at
the
top
of
surrey
street
we
have
evensong
at
five
at
christopher
no
one
conies
much
the
people
in
the
parish
are
the
weekday
church
sort
those
among
them
who
come
to
church
at
all
mostly
confine
their
energies
to
evening
service
on
sundays
though
a
few
of
them
consent
to
turn
up
at
choral
mass
at
eleven
and
by
means
of
guilds
and
persuasion
we
induced
a
good
many
of
the
lads
and
girls
to
come
to
early
mass
sometimes
the
vicar
gets
discouraged
at
times
but
not
so
much
as
most
vicars
would
because
he
more
or
less
agrees
with
me
in
not
thinking
a
test
of
christianity
the
vicar
is
one
of
the
cleverest
and
most
original
parsons
in
the
church
in
my
opinion
he
has
a
keen
shrewd
practical
insight
into
the
distinction
between
essentials
and
he
is
popular
in
the
parish
but
i
do
think
the
people
understand
as
a
rule
what
he
is
getting
at
anyhow
the
only
people
who
usually
came
to
our
services
were
a
few
church
workers
and
an
elderly
lady
or
two
who
happened
to
be
passing
and
dropped
in
the
elderly
ladies
who
lived
in
the
parish
were
much
too
busy
for
any
such
foolishness
but
this
evening
the
evening
of
the
day
i
had
met
gideon
there
was
a
girl
in
church
she
was
rather
at
the
back
and
i
did
see
who
it
was
till
i
was
going
out
then
she
stopped
me
at
the
door
and
i
saw
that
it
was
clare
potter
i
knew
clare
potter
very
slightly
and
had
never
found
her
interesting
i
had
always
believed
her
to
be
conventional
and
commonplace
without
the
brains
of
the
twins
or
even
the
mild
spirituality
of
frank
but
i
was
startled
by
her
face
now
it
was
white
and
strained
and
emotion
wavered
pitifully
over
it
she
said
you
hear
my
confession
very
sorry
i
told
her
i
ca
i
still
in
orders
she
seemed
disappointed
oh
dear
i
did
know
i
was
puzzled
why
had
she
pitched
on
me
had
she
i
wondered
a
regular
director
or
was
it
her
first
confession
she
wanted
to
make
i
began
something
about
the
vicar
being
always
glad
but
she
stopped
me
please
it
must
be
you
there
a
reason
well
if
you
ca
hear
my
confession
may
i
tell
you
something
in
private
and
get
your
advice
course
i
said
at
once
if
you
time
it
very
urgent
i
had
time
and
we
went
into
the
vestry
she
sat
down
and
i
waited
for
her
to
speak
she
was
nervous
or
embarrassed
as
most
people
are
in
these
interviews
two
things
occurred
to
me
about
her
one
was
that
she
was
in
a
way
too
far
through
too
mentally
agitated
to
be
embarrassed
the
other
was
that
she
was
quite
unconsciously
posing
a
little
behaving
as
the
heroine
of
one
of
her
mother
novels
might
have
behaved
one
knows
the
situation
in
fiction
the
desperate
girl
appealing
out
of
her
misery
to
the
christian
priest
for
help
so
many
women
have
this
touch
of
melodrama
this
sense
of
a
situation
i
believed
that
she
was
as
she
sat
there
in
these
two
conditions
simultaneously
exactly
as
i
was
simultaneously
analysing
her
and
wanting
to
be
of
what
service
i
could
she
leant
forward
across
the
vestry
table
locking
and
unlocking
her
hands
is
quite
private
is
it
she
said
private
as
if
i
told
her
she
drew
a
long
shivering
breath
and
leant
her
forehead
on
her
clasped
hands
know
she
said
so
low
that
i
had
to
bend
forward
to
catch
it
people
are
saying
what
my
people
suspect
about
about
oliver
hobart
death
i
know
it
was
mr
gideon
know
that
i
said
quickly
and
a
great
relief
flooded
me
i
known
until
that
moment
because
i
had
driven
it
under
how
large
a
part
of
my
brain
believed
that
gideon
had
perhaps
done
this
thing
she
whispered
know
it
because
i
know
i
know
who
did
it
in
that
moment
i
felt
that
i
knew
too
and
that
gideon
knew
and
that
i
ought
to
have
guessed
all
along
i
said
nothing
but
waited
for
the
girl
next
word
if
she
had
a
next
word
to
say
it
was
for
me
to
question
her
and
then
quite
suddenly
she
gave
a
little
moan
of
misery
and
broke
into
passionate
tears
i
waited
for
a
moment
then
i
got
up
and
poured
her
out
a
glass
of
water
it
must
have
been
pretty
bad
for
her
it
must
have
been
pretty
bad
all
this
time
i
thought
knowing
this
thing
about
her
sister
she
drank
the
water
and
became
quieter
you
want
to
tell
me
any
more
i
asked
her
presently
i
do
i
do
but
it
so
difficult
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
oh
god
it
was
that
killed
him
i
said
after
a
moment
gently
and
without
apparent
surprise
one
learns
in
parish
work
not
to
start
however
much
one
may
be
startled
i
merely
added
a
legitimate
inquiry
was
that
she
gulped
want
to
tell
you
everything
i
to
i
was
sure
she
did
she
had
reached
the
familiar
stage
it
was
obviously
going
to
be
a
relief
to
her
to
spread
herself
on
the
subject
i
am
pretty
well
used
to
being
told
everything
and
at
times
a
good
deal
more
and
have
learnt
to
discount
much
of
it
i
looked
away
from
her
and
prepared
to
listen
and
to
give
my
mind
to
sifting
if
i
could
the
fact
from
the
fancy
in
her
story
this
is
a
special
art
and
one
which
all
parsons
do
well
to
learn
i
have
heard
my
vicar
on
the
subject
of
women
confessions
women
some
of
them
will
invent
any
crime
give
themselves
away
with
both
hands
merely
to
make
themselves
interesting
poor
things
they
do
realise
how
tedious
sin
is
one
has
to
be
on
one
guard
the
whole
time
with
that
kind
i
deduced
that
clare
potter
might
possibly
be
that
kind
so
i
listened
carefully
at
first
neither
believing
nor
disbelieving
difficult
to
tell
you
she
began
in
a
pathetic
unsteady
voice
hurts
rather
i
think
not
i
corrected
her
a
relief
is
it
she
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
then
went
on
i
to
tell
but
it
hurts
all
the
same
i
let
her
have
it
her
own
way
i
could
press
the
point
she
really
thought
it
did
hurt
i
perceived
that
she
had
like
so
many
people
a
confused
mind
on
i
said
must
begin
a
long
way
back
you
see
before
oliver
fell
in
love
with
jane
he
he
cared
a
little
for
me
he
really
did
juke
and
he
made
me
care
for
him
her
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
this
was
truth
i
felt
no
doubt
as
to
that
then
jane
came
and
took
him
away
from
me
he
fell
in
love
with
her
i
thought
my
heart
would
break
i
did
protest
against
the
phrase
or
ask
her
to
explain
it
because
she
was
unhappy
but
i
wish
people
would
use
it
because
i
do
know
and
they
do
know
what
they
mean
by
it
thought
i
should
be
very
unhappy
is
that
the
meaning
no
because
they
are
already
that
thought
my
heart
the
physical
organ
would
be
injuriously
affected
to
the
point
of
rupture
no
i
do
not
believe
that
is
what
they
mean
frankly
i
do
not
know
there
should
be
a
dictionary
of
the
phrases
in
common
use
however
it
would
have
been
pedantic
and
unkind
to
ask
miss
potter
who
could
probably
explain
no
phrases
to
explain
this
she
went
on
crying
a
little
again
could
stop
caring
for
him
all
at
once
how
could
i
i
suppose
you
despise
me
juke
but
i
just
could
help
going
on
loving
him
it
once
and
for
ever
with
me
oh
i
expect
you
think
it
was
shameful
of
me
to
love
no
why
it
human
nature
you
had
bad
luck
that
all
i
did
well
there
it
was
you
see
he
was
married
to
jane
and
i
cared
for
him
so
much
that
i
could
hardly
bear
to
go
to
the
house
and
see
them
together
oh
it
was
my
fault
he
me
care
indeed
he
did
i
never
have
begun
for
myself
i
not
that
sort
of
girl
i
never
was
i
know
some
girls
do
it
but
i
never
could
have
i
suppose
i
too
proud
or
something
she
paused
but
i
made
no
comment
i
never
comment
on
the
pride
of
which
i
am
so
often
informed
by
those
who
possess
it
she
resumed
it
went
on
and
on
and
i
did
seem
to
get
to
feel
any
better
about
it
and
i
hated
jane
oh
i
know
that
was
wicked
of
course
as
she
knew
it
i
again
made
no
comment
sometimes
i
think
i
hated
when
he
thought
of
nothing
but
her
and
never
at
all
of
me
well
sometimes
there
was
trouble
between
them
because
jane
would
do
things
and
go
about
with
people
he
like
and
especially
gideon
we
none
of
us
like
gideon
at
home
you
know
we
think
he
awful
he
so
rude
and
has
such
silly
opinions
and
is
so
conceited
and
unkind
he
been
awfully
rude
to
father
papers
always
and
that
horrid
article
he
had
in
his
silly
paper
about
what
he
called
fiction
mostly
about
books
did
you
read
it
but
gideon
did
write
it
you
know
it
was
some
one
else
well
it
was
in
his
paper
anyhow
and
he
it
and
anyhow
what
are
books
to
hurt
people
feelings
about
a
laudable
sentiment
and
one
which
should
be
illuminated
as
a
text
on
the
writing
table
of
every
reviewer
of
course
i
know
he
a
friend
of
yours
she
added
really
why
i
came
to
you
but
we
none
of
us
like
him
at
home
and
oliver
could
stick
him
and
he
begged
jane
not
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
but
she
would
she
wrote
in
his
paper
and
she
was
always
seeing
him
and
oliver
got
more
and
more
disgusted
about
it
and
i
could
bear
to
see
him
unhappy
i
questioned
she
paused
checked
by
the
interruption
then
after
a
moment
she
said
suppose
you
mean
i
was
glad
really
because
it
came
between
them
well
i
do
know
perhaps
i
was
then
well
any
one
be
people
i
agreed
she
went
on
a
little
less
fluently
of
which
i
was
glad
fluency
and
accuracy
are
a
bad
pair
i
would
rather
people
stumbled
and
stammered
out
their
stories
than
poured
them
i
think
he
thought
oliver
thought
he
began
to
suspect
that
gideon
was
you
know
with
jane
and
i
thought
so
too
and
he
thought
jane
was
careless
about
not
discouraging
him
and
seeing
so
much
of
him
and
all
but
thought
she
was
worse
than
that
and
encouraged
him
and
did
care
jane
was
always
dreadfully
selfish
you
know
that
evening
i
prompted
her
as
she
paused
that
evening
she
shuddered
a
little
and
went
on
quickly
been
dining
with
a
friend
and
i
was
to
sleep
at
jane
i
got
there
soon
after
ten
and
no
one
was
in
so
i
went
to
my
room
to
take
my
things
off
then
i
heard
jane
come
in
with
gideon
they
went
upstairs
to
the
and
i
heard
them
talking
there
my
door
was
a
little
open
and
i
heard
what
they
said
and
he
said
i
suggested
better
not
tell
me
what
they
said
since
they
thought
they
were
alone
what
do
you
think
very
well
there
no
harm
i
thought
i
better
tell
you
everything
but
as
you
like
she
was
a
little
disappointed
but
picked
herself
up
and
continued
then
i
heard
oliver
coming
upstairs
and
he
stopped
at
the
door
for
a
moment
before
they
saw
him
i
think
because
he
did
speak
quite
at
once
then
he
said
good
evening
and
they
said
hallo
and
they
all
began
to
be
nasty
in
their
voices
you
know
he
said
he
obviously
come
home
before
he
was
expected
and
then
jane
went
upstairs
pretending
nothing
was
the
matter
jane
never
bothers
about
anything
and
i
heard
gideon
come
up
to
oliver
and
ask
him
what
he
meant
by
that
and
they
talked
just
outside
my
door
and
they
were
very
disagreeable
but
i
suppose
you
do
want
me
to
tell
you
what
they
said
so
i
wo
anyhow
it
was
much
only
oliver
gave
gideon
to
understand
he
was
to
come
there
any
more
and
gideon
said
he
certainly
had
no
intention
of
doing
so
oh
yes
and
he
said
damn
you
rather
loud
and
then
he
went
downstairs
and
left
the
house
i
heard
the
door
shut
after
him
then
i
came
out
of
my
room
and
there
was
oliver
standing
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
looking
as
if
he
did
see
anything
he
did
seem
to
see
me
even
i
could
bear
it
he
was
so
white
and
angry
and
thinking
of
nothing
but
jane
who
was
worth
thinking
about
because
she
did
care
and
then
i
lost
my
head
i
think
i
was
mad
i
felt
awfully
queer
for
a
long
time
i
could
bear
it
any
more
his
being
unhappy
about
jane
and
not
even
seeing
me
i
went
up
to
him
and
said
oliver
i
glad
you
got
rid
of
that
horrid
man
stared
at
me
and
still
did
seem
to
see
me
that
somehow
made
me
furious
i
said
jane
much
too
fond
of
him
she
always
with
him
now
they
spent
this
evening
together
you
know
and
came
home
together
he
seemed
to
wake
up
and
he
looked
at
me
with
a
look
i
had
ever
seen
before
and
it
was
as
if
the
world
was
at
an
end
because
i
saw
he
hated
me
for
saying
that
and
he
said
kindly
let
my
affairs
and
alone
in
a
horrible
sharp
cold
voice
i
could
bear
it
it
seemed
to
kill
something
in
me
my
love
for
him
perhaps
i
went
first
cold
then
hot
and
i
was
crazy
with
anger
i
pushed
him
back
out
of
the
way
to
let
me
pass
i
pushed
him
suddenly
and
so
hard
that
he
lost
his
balance
oh
you
know
the
rest
he
was
standing
at
the
top
of
those
awful
stairs
why
are
people
to
make
stairs
like
that
and
he
reeled
and
fell
backwards
oh
dear
oh
dear
and
you
know
the
rest
she
was
sobbing
bitterly
now
yes
i
said
know
the
rest
and
i
said
no
more
for
a
time
i
was
puzzled
that
she
had
truly
repeated
what
had
passed
between
her
and
hobart
i
believed
but
whether
she
had
pushed
him
or
whether
he
had
lost
his
own
balance
seemed
to
me
still
an
open
question
i
had
to
consider
two
things
how
best
to
help
this
girl
and
how
to
get
gideon
out
of
the
mess
as
quickly
and
as
quietly
as
possible
for
both
these
things
i
had
to
get
at
the
truth
if
i
could
look
here
i
said
presently
this
story
you
told
me
wholly
true
did
it
actually
happen
precisely
like
that
please
think
for
a
moment
and
then
tell
me
but
she
did
think
not
even
for
a
moment
she
sobbed
why
should
i
it
if
it
was
why
indeed
i
began
to
enumerate
some
possible
reasons
an
inaccurate
habit
of
mind
a
sensational
imagination
both
these
misfortunes
being
hereditary
an
egotistic
craving
for
attention
even
unfavourable
attention
it
might
be
any
of
these
things
or
all
but
i
had
got
far
before
she
broke
in
god
i
not
had
a
moment
peace
since
i
loved
him
and
i
killed
him
i
let
them
think
it
was
an
accident
it
was
as
if
i
was
gagged
i
speak
and
after
a
bit
when
it
had
all
settled
down
there
did
seem
to
be
any
reason
why
i
should
say
anything
i
never
thought
truly
i
never
thought
that
they
ever
suspect
some
one
else
and
then
a
little
while
ago
i
heard
mother
saying
something
to
some
one
about
gideon
and
last
night
katherine
varick
came
and
told
jane
people
were
saying
it
everywhere
and
this
morning
there
was
that
piece
in
the
oh
what
shall
i
do
really
i
said
any
doubt
about
that
do
you
she
lifted
her
wet
puckered
face
and
stared
at
me
and
i
saw
that
for
the
moment
at
least
she
was
not
thinking
of
herself
at
all
but
only
of
her
tragedy
and
her
problem
mean
she
whispered
i
must
tell
rather
obvious
is
it
i
said
gently
because
i
was
horribly
sorry
for
her
must
tell
the
truth
whatever
it
is
be
tried
for
murder
or
manslaughter
appear
in
the
docks
she
quavered
her
frightened
brown
eyes
large
and
round
do
think
it
would
come
to
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
tell
your
parents
your
father
is
responsible
for
the
stuff
in
the
papers
and
your
mother
i
gather
for
the
spreading
of
the
story
personally
your
confession
to
them
would
stop
that
they
would
withdraw
retract
what
they
have
said
and
say
publicly
that
they
were
mistaken
that
the
evidence
they
thought
they
had
had
been
proved
false
then
it
would
be
generally
assumed
again
that
the
thing
was
an
accident
and
the
talk
would
die
down
no
one
need
ever
know
but
your
parents
and
myself
i
am
bound
and
they
would
choose
not
to
repeat
it
to
any
one
to
jane
she
questioned
what
does
jane
think
at
present
does
she
suspect
she
shook
her
head
do
know
jane
been
rather
queer
all
day
i
sometimes
thought
she
suspected
something
only
if
she
did
i
believe
she
have
told
me
jane
does
consider
people
feelings
you
know
she
say
anything
however
awful
only
she
deep
too
not
like
me
i
must
have
things
out
she
keep
them
dark
sometimes
no
i
do
know
what
jane
thinks
really
i
do
i
did
know
either
another
thing
i
did
know
was
what
gideon
thought
they
might
both
suspect
clare
and
this
might
have
tied
hands
he
might
have
shrunk
from
defending
himself
at
the
expense
of
a
frightened
unhappy
girl
and
jane
sister
but
this
was
my
business
i
said
may
find
you
have
to
tell
jane
perhaps
in
a
way
you
owe
it
to
jane
to
tell
her
but
the
essential
thing
is
that
you
should
tell
your
parents
that
quite
necessary
of
course
and
you
should
do
it
at
once
this
evening
directly
you
get
home
every
minute
lost
makes
the
thing
worse
i
think
you
should
catch
the
next
train
back
to
potter
bar
you
see
what
you
say
may
affect
what
is
in
morning
papers
this
thing
has
to
be
stopped
at
once
before
further
damage
is
done
she
looked
at
me
palely
her
hands
twisting
convulsively
in
and
out
of
each
other
i
saw
her
for
all
her
seven
or
years
as
a
weak
frightened
child
ignorant
like
a
child
of
the
mischief
she
was
doing
to
others
concerned
like
a
child
with
her
own
troubles
and
fears
and
the
burden
on
her
own
conscience
i
was
inclined
now
to
believe
in
that
push
she
whimpered
all
this
time
i
said
nothing
how
can
i
now
it
too
awful
too
difficult
i
looked
at
her
in
silence
your
proposal
then
i
asked
her
i
may
have
sounded
hard
and
unkind
but
i
did
feel
so
i
was
immensely
sorry
for
her
only
i
believe
a
certain
amount
of
hard
practicality
is
the
only
wholesome
treatment
to
apply
to
emotional
and
wordy
people
one
has
to
make
them
face
facts
put
everything
in
terms
of
action
if
she
had
come
to
me
for
advice
she
should
have
it
if
she
had
come
to
me
merely
to
get
relief
by
unburdening
her
tortured
conscience
she
should
find
the
burden
doubled
unless
she
took
the
only
possible
way
out
she
looked
this
way
and
that
with
scared
hunted
eyes
thought
perhaps
they
might
be
made
to
think
it
was
an
accident
you
see
i
could
tell
them
that
he
left
the
house
gideon
i
mean
before
oliver
fell
that
would
be
true
i
could
say
i
heard
gideon
go
and
heard
oliver
fall
afterwards
that
what
i
thought
say
then
he
be
cleared
would
he
have
you
i
asked
this
already
directly
you
knew
that
gideon
was
suspected
i
did
like
she
faltered
wanted
to
ask
some
one
advice
i
wanted
to
know
what
you
thought
told
you
i
answered
her
i
think
it
more
than
thinking
i
know
you
got
to
tell
them
the
exact
truth
whatever
it
is
really
no
question
about
it
you
could
go
to
them
with
a
half
true
story
could
you
do
know
she
sighed
pinching
her
fingers
together
nervously
do
know
it
would
be
impossible
you
could
lie
about
a
thing
like
that
you
got
to
tell
the
truth
not
all
you
told
me
if
you
do
want
to
but
simply
that
you
pushed
him
in
impatience
not
meaning
to
hurt
him
and
that
he
fell
it
quite
simple
really
if
you
do
it
at
once
it
wo
be
if
you
leave
it
until
the
thing
has
gone
further
and
gideon
is
perhaps
arrested
you
have
to
tell
the
public
the
story
then
now
it
easy
no
i
beg
your
pardon
it
not
easy
i
know
that
very
hard
but
there
it
is
it
got
to
be
done
and
done
at
once
she
listened
in
silence
drooping
and
huddled
together
i
was
reminded
pitifully
of
some
soft
little
animal
caught
in
a
trap
and
paralysed
with
fear
she
gasped
must
i
must
i
know
i
must
but
i
not
going
to
repeat
the
things
i
said
they
were
the
usual
truisms
and
one
has
to
say
them
i
had
accepted
her
story
now
it
seemed
simpler
the
complex
part
of
the
business
was
that
at
one
moment
i
was
simply
persuading
a
frightened
and
reluctant
girl
to
do
the
straight
and
decent
and
difficult
thing
and
at
the
next
i
was
wasting
words
on
an
egotist
we
all
that
after
all
who
was
subconsciously
enjoying
the
situation
and
wanting
to
prolong
it
one
feels
the
difference
always
and
it
is
that
duplicity
of
aim
in
seekers
after
advice
that
occasionally
makes
one
cruel
and
hard
because
it
seems
the
only
profitable
method
it
must
have
been
ten
minutes
before
i
wrung
out
of
her
a
faltering
but
definite
do
it
then
i
stood
up
there
was
no
more
time
to
be
wasted
train
can
you
get
i
asked
her
do
know
the
perhaps
she
rose
too
her
little
wet
crumpled
handkerchief
still
in
her
hand
i
saw
she
had
something
else
to
say
been
so
miserable
of
course
been
on
my
so
what
things
people
of
this
type
give
themselves
the
trouble
of
saying
it
will
be
off
your
mind
now
i
suggested
it
but
it
will
still
be
there
the
awful
thing
i
did
i
ought
to
confess
it
ought
i
and
get
absolution
i
do
make
my
confession
you
know
but
i
never
told
this
not
properly
i
know
i
ought
to
have
done
but
i
could
get
it
out
ever
i
put
it
so
that
the
priest
could
understand
i
suppose
it
was
awfully
mean
and
cowardly
of
me
and
i
ought
to
confess
it
properly
but
i
could
go
into
that
question
not
being
entirely
sure
even
now
she
ought
to
confess
i
merely
said
why
make
confessions
at
all
if
you
do
make
them
properly
she
only
gave
her
little
soft
quivering
sigh
it
was
too
difficult
a
question
for
her
to
answer
and
after
all
a
foolish
one
to
ask
why
do
we
do
all
the
hundreds
of
things
that
we
do
do
properly
reasons
are
many
and
motives
mixed
i
walked
with
her
to
the
king
cross
bus
and
saw
her
into
it
we
shook
hands
as
we
parted
and
hers
was
hot
and
clinging
i
saw
that
she
was
all
tense
and
strung
up
she
whispered
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
being
so
good
to
me
i
do
what
you
told
me
if
it
kills
me
i
will
good
i
returned
it
wo
kill
you
you
know
i
smiled
at
her
as
she
got
on
to
the
bus
and
she
smiled
pitifully
back
i
walked
back
to
my
rooms
i
felt
rather
tired
and
had
a
queer
feeling
of
having
hammered
away
on
something
soft
and
yielding
and
yet
unbreakable
like
putty
i
felt
sick
at
having
been
so
hard
and
sick
too
that
she
was
so
soft
sick
of
words
and
phrases
and
facile
emotions
and
situations
and
insincerities
and
potterisms
and
yet
with
an
odd
tide
of
hope
surging
through
the
sickness
because
of
human
nature
which
is
so
mixed
that
natural
cowards
will
sometimes
take
a
steep
and
hard
way
where
they
might
take
an
easy
one
and
because
we
all
in
the
middle
of
our
egotism
and
vanity
and
are
often
sorry
for
what
we
have
done
really
sorry
beneath
all
the
cheap
penitence
which
leads
nowhere
so
sorry
that
we
sometimes
can
not
bear
it
any
more
and
will
break
up
our
own
lives
to
make
amends
and
if
at
the
same
time
we
watch
our
sorrow
and
our
amends
and
see
it
as
drama
and
as
interesting
well
after
all
it
is
drama
and
it
is
interesting
so
why
not
we
ca
all
be
clear
and
steely
unsentimentalists
like
katherine
varick
one
has
to
learn
to
bear
sentimentalism
in
parishes
which
are
the
world
one
has
to
endure
it
accept
it
it
is
part
of
the
general
muddle
and
mess
i
got
a
next
morning
early
together
with
the
the
illustrated
pinkerton
daily
i
looked
through
them
quickly
there
was
no
reference
to
the
hobart
mystery
i
was
relieved
clare
potter
had
kept
her
word
then
or
anyhow
had
said
enough
to
clear
gideon
i
was
going
further
than
that
about
her
i
had
done
my
utmost
to
make
her
do
the
straight
thing
in
the
straight
way
and
must
leave
the
rest
to
her
and
the
pinkertons
were
withdrawing
they
would
have
later
to
withdraw
more
definitely
than
by
mere
abstaining
from
further
accusation
i
intended
to
see
to
that
if
no
one
else
did
but
this
was
a
beginning
it
was
no
doubt
all
that
pinkerton
had
been
able
to
arrange
last
night
over
the
telephone
it
would
have
interested
me
to
have
been
present
at
that
interview
between
clare
and
her
parents
i
should
like
to
have
seen
pinkerton
provided
by
his
innocent
little
daughter
with
the
sensation
of
his
life
and
leila
yorke
the
author
of
forced
to
realise
her
own
abominable
forced
also
to
realise
that
her
messages
from
the
other
side
had
been
as
lacking
in
accuracy
as
unfortunately
messages
from
this
side
too
so
often
are
i
hoped
the
affair
hobart
would
be
a
lesson
to
both
pinkertons
but
like
most
of
the
lessons
set
before
us
in
this
life
i
feared
it
would
be
a
lesson
unlearnt
anyhow
pinkerton
was
prompt
and
business
like
in
his
methods
his
evening
paper
contained
a
paragraph
to
this
effect
of
mr
hobart
considered
accidental
play
not
suspected
investigation
into
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
sudden
death
of
oliver
hobart
the
late
editor
of
the
have
resulted
in
conclusive
evidence
that
the
tragedy
was
due
to
hobart
accidental
stumbling
and
falling
his
fall
which
was
audible
to
the
other
inmates
of
the
house
took
place
after
the
departure
of
arthur
gideon
with
whom
he
had
been
talking
a
statement
to
this
effect
has
been
made
by
miss
clare
potter
who
was
staying
in
the
house
at
the
time
and
who
was
at
the
time
of
the
inquest
too
much
prostrated
by
the
shock
to
give
evidence
it
was
a
retraction
all
right
and
all
that
could
be
expected
of
the
pinkerton
press
in
its
decision
and
emphasis
i
read
scare
i
did
give
much
more
thought
just
then
to
the
business
i
was
pretty
busy
with
meetings
and
committees
and
with
rehearsals
of
new
way
to
pay
old
debts
which
we
were
playing
to
the
parish
in
a
week
i
had
it
at
oxford
once
and
had
got
some
of
the
same
people
together
and
it
was
going
pretty
well
but
needed
a
good
deal
of
attention
i
had
too
to
go
away
from
town
for
a
day
or
two
on
some
business
connected
with
the
church
congress
church
congresses
keep
an
incredible
number
of
people
busy
about
them
beforehand
besides
all
the
management
of
committees
and
programmes
and
there
is
the
management
of
all
the
people
of
divergent
views
who
wo
meet
each
other
such
as
george
lansbury
and
athelstan
riley
not
that
this
delicate
task
fell
to
me
i
was
only
concerned
with
life
and
liberty
on
the
day
after
i
came
back
i
met
jane
at
the
club
after
lunch
she
came
over
and
sat
down
by
me
she
said
you
been
seeing
the
have
it
been
more
interesting
lately
than
my
own
paper
so
arthur
acquitted
without
a
stain
on
his
character
poor
mother
rather
sick
about
it
she
thought
she
had
a
message
you
know
that
frightful
ayres
woman
had
a
vision
in
a
glass
ball
of
arthur
knocking
oliver
downstairs
i
expect
you
heard
every
one
did
mother
went
round
to
see
her
about
it
the
other
day
but
she
still
sticks
to
it
poor
mother
does
know
what
to
make
of
it
either
the
ball
lied
or
the
ayres
woman
lied
or
clare
is
lying
she
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
the
ayres
so
they
had
words
i
expect
they
make
it
up
before
long
but
at
present
there
rather
a
slump
in
other
side
business
and
she
wrote
a
letter
of
apology
to
arthur
father
made
her
he
was
so
afraid
arthur
would
bring
a
libel
action
did
he
i
asked
wondering
first
how
much
of
the
truth
either
arthur
or
jane
had
suspected
all
this
time
and
secondly
how
much
they
now
knew
jane
looked
at
me
with
her
guarded
considering
glance
she
said
do
mind
your
knowing
you
better
not
let
on
to
him
that
i
told
you
though
he
might
like
it
the
fact
is
arthur
thought
i
done
it
he
thought
it
was
because
my
manner
was
so
queer
as
if
i
was
trying
to
hush
it
up
i
was
you
see
i
thought
arthur
had
done
it
it
seemed
so
awfully
likely
because
i
left
them
quarrelling
and
arthur
got
an
awfully
bad
temper
and
manner
was
so
queer
we
never
talked
it
out
till
two
days
ago
we
avoided
talking
to
each
other
at
all
almost
after
the
first
but
on
that
first
morning
when
he
came
round
to
see
me
we
somehow
succeeded
in
diddling
one
another
because
we
were
each
so
anxious
to
shield
the
other
and
hush
it
all
up
clare
might
have
saved
us
both
quite
a
lot
of
worrying
if
she
spoken
out
at
once
and
said
it
was
an
accident
jane
voice
was
so
unemotional
her
face
and
manner
so
calm
that
she
is
a
very
dark
horse
sometimes
i
could
tell
for
certain
whether
she
had
nearly
instead
of
accident
said
or
whether
she
had
spoken
in
good
faith
i
could
tell
how
much
she
knew
or
had
been
told
or
guessed
i
said
suppose
she
did
realise
till
lately
that
any
one
was
likely
to
be
suspected
and
jane
acquiesced
funny
she
said
after
a
moment
are
i
generalised
has
a
muddled
mind
said
jane
often
have
never
know
said
jane
thoughtfully
much
to
believe
of
what
she
says
i
dare
say
she
does
quite
know
herself
does
not
said
jane
old
clare
we
necessarily
left
it
at
that
since
jane
did
of
course
mean
to
tell
me
what
story
clare
had
told
of
that
evening
happenings
and
i
could
tell
jane
the
one
clare
had
told
me
i
did
imagine
i
should
ever
be
wiser
than
i
was
now
on
the
subject
and
it
certainly
was
my
business
any
more
when
i
met
clare
potter
by
chance
a
week
or
two
later
on
the
steps
of
the
national
gallery
with
another
girl
she
flushed
bowed
and
passed
me
quickly
that
was
natural
enough
after
our
last
interview
queer
that
those
two
girls
should
be
sisters
they
were
an
interesting
study
to
me
clare
shallow
credulous
weak
in
the
intelligence
conventional
emotional
sensitive
of
the
eternal
type
of
orthodox
and
timid
woman
with
profound
powers
of
passion
and
that
touch
of
melodrama
that
sense
of
a
situation
which
might
lead
her
along
strange
paths
and
jane
hard
calm
cynical
an
egotist
to
her
knowing
what
she
wanted
and
going
for
it
tough
in
the
conscience
and
ignorant
of
love
except
in
its
crudest
form
of
desire
for
the
people
and
things
which
ministered
to
her
personal
happiness
it
struck
me
that
the
two
represented
two
sides
of
potterism
the
intellectual
and
moral
clare
the
ignorant
sentimentalist
jane
reacting
against
this
but
on
her
part
grabbing
and
exploiting
their
attitude
towards
truth
that
bugbear
of
potterism
was
typical
clare
could
see
it
jane
saw
it
perfectly
clearly
and
would
reject
it
without
hesitation
if
it
suited
her
book
clare
was
like
her
mother
only
with
better
simpler
stuff
in
her
jane
was
rather
like
her
father
in
her
shrewd
native
wit
only
while
he
was
vulgar
in
his
mind
she
was
only
vulgar
in
her
soul
of
one
thing
i
was
sure
they
would
both
be
on
the
whole
satisfied
with
life
jane
because
she
would
get
what
she
wanted
clare
because
she
would
be
content
with
little
clare
would
inevitably
marry
as
inevitably
she
would
love
her
husband
and
her
children
and
come
to
regard
her
passion
for
oliver
hobart
and
its
tragic
sequel
as
a
romantic
episode
of
girlhood
a
sort
of
sowing
of
wild
oats
before
the
real
business
of
life
began
and
jane
would
i
presumed
ultimately
marry
gideon
who
was
too
good
for
her
altogether
too
fine
and
too
good
for
gideon
was
direct
and
keen
and
passionate
and
loved
and
hated
cleanly
and
thought
finely
and
acutely
gideon
was
greedy
he
took
life
and
its
pleasures
and
triumphs
and
amusements
in
his
stride
as
part
of
the
day
work
he
did
seek
them
out
for
their
own
sakes
gideon
lived
for
causes
and
beliefs
and
ideals
he
was
temperamentally
christian
though
he
happen
to
believe
christian
dogma
he
had
his
alloy
like
other
people
of
ambition
and
selfishness
but
so
much
less
than
for
instance
i
have
that
it
is
absurd
that
he
should
be
the
agnostic
and
i
the
professing
christian
the
christian
church
sometimes
one
feels
that
it
is
a
fantasy
the
flaming
ideal
one
has
for
it
one
thinks
of
it
as
a
fire
a
sword
an
army
with
banners
marching
against
dragons
one
does
see
how
such
power
can
be
withstood
be
the
dragons
never
so
strong
and
then
one
looks
round
and
sees
it
instead
as
a
frail
organisation
of
the
lame
the
halt
and
the
blind
a
tepid
organisation
of
the
satisfied
the
bourgeois
the
conventionally
genteel
a
helpless
organisation
of
the
ignorant
the
the
stupid
an
organisation
full
to
the
brim
of
cant
humbug
timid
orthodoxy
unreality
and
all
kinds
of
potterism
and
one
does
see
how
it
can
overcome
anything
whatever
what
is
the
truth
where
between
these
two
poles
does
the
actual
church
stand
or
does
it
like
most
of
us
its
members
swing
to
and
from
between
them
touching
now
one
now
the
other
a
potterite
church
yes
because
we
are
most
of
us
potterites
an
church
yes
again
because
at
its
heart
is
something
sharp
and
clean
and
fine
and
direct
like
a
sword
which
will
not
let
us
be
contented
potterites
but
which
is
for
ever
goading
us
out
of
ourselves
pricking
us
out
of
our
trivial
satisfactions
and
our
egotistic
discontents
i
suppose
the
fact
is
that
the
church
can
only
work
on
the
material
it
finds
and
do
a
little
here
and
a
little
there
it
would
be
a
sword
in
the
hands
of
such
men
as
gideon
on
the
other
hand
it
ca
do
much
with
the
clare
potters
the
real
thing
frightens
them
if
ever
they
see
it
the
sham
thing
they
mould
to
their
own
liking
till
it
is
no
more
than
a
comfortable
shelter
from
the
storms
of
life
it
is
the
potters
who
have
taken
the
church
and
spoilt
it
degraded
it
to
the
poor
dull
thing
it
is
it
is
the
potterism
in
all
of
us
which
at
every
turn
checks
and
drags
it
down
personally
i
can
forgive
potterism
everything
but
that
what
is
one
to
do
about
it
part
vi
told
by
chapter
i
the
end
of
a
potter
melodrama
while
clare
talked
to
juke
in
the
vestry
jane
talked
to
her
parents
at
potter
bar
she
was
trying
to
make
them
drop
their
campaign
against
gideon
but
she
had
no
success
lady
pinkerton
said
claims
of
truth
are
inexorable
truth
is
a
hard
god
to
follow
and
often
demands
the
sacrifice
of
one
personal
feelings
lord
pinkerton
said
think
now
the
thing
has
gone
so
far
it
had
better
be
thoroughly
sifted
if
gideon
is
innocent
it
is
only
due
to
him
if
he
is
guilty
it
is
due
to
the
public
you
must
remember
that
he
edits
a
paper
which
has
a
certain
circulation
small
no
doubt
but
still
a
circulation
he
is
not
altogether
like
a
private
and
irresponsible
person
lady
pinkerton
remarked
that
we
are
none
of
us
that
we
all
owe
a
duty
to
society
and
so
forth
then
clare
came
in
just
as
they
had
finished
dinner
she
would
not
have
any
her
face
was
red
and
swollen
with
crying
she
said
she
had
something
to
tell
them
at
once
that
would
not
keep
a
moment
gideon
must
be
suspected
any
more
of
having
killed
oliver
for
she
had
done
it
herself
after
gideon
had
left
the
house
they
did
not
believe
her
at
first
she
was
hysterical
and
they
all
knew
clare
but
she
grew
more
circumstantial
about
it
till
they
began
to
believe
it
after
all
they
reasoned
it
explained
her
having
been
so
completely
knocked
over
by
the
catastrophe
jane
asked
her
why
she
had
done
it
she
said
she
had
only
meant
to
push
him
away
from
her
and
he
had
fallen
lady
pinkerton
said
him
away
my
dear
then
was
he
was
he
too
close
she
meant
clare
cried
and
did
not
answer
lady
pinkerton
concluded
that
oliver
had
been
trying
to
kiss
clare
and
that
clare
had
repulsed
him
jane
knew
that
lady
pinkerton
thought
this
and
so
did
clare
jane
thought
means
us
to
think
that
that
mean
it
true
clare
has
got
what
arthur
calls
a
grip
on
facts
lord
pinkerton
said
is
very
painful
my
dears
very
painful
indeed
jane
my
dear
he
meant
that
jane
was
to
go
away
because
it
was
even
more
painful
for
her
than
for
the
others
but
jane
did
go
it
was
painful
for
jane
really
she
felt
hard
and
cold
and
as
if
nothing
mattered
she
was
angry
with
clare
for
crying
instead
of
explaining
what
had
happened
lady
pinkerton
said
passing
her
hand
over
her
forehead
in
the
tired
way
she
had
and
shutting
her
eyes
dear
you
are
you
know
what
you
are
saying
you
will
be
able
to
tell
us
more
clearly
in
the
morning
but
clare
said
they
must
believe
her
now
and
lord
pinkerton
must
telephone
up
to
the
and
have
the
stuff
about
the
hobart
mystery
stopped
poor
child
said
lady
pinkerton
has
made
you
suddenly
so
long
after
tell
us
this
terrible
story
clare
sobbed
that
she
had
been
able
to
bear
it
on
her
mind
any
more
and
also
that
she
had
known
till
lately
that
gideon
was
suspected
lord
and
lady
pinkerton
looked
at
each
other
wondering
what
to
believe
then
at
jane
wishing
she
was
gone
so
that
they
could
ask
clare
more
about
it
jane
said
mind
me
i
do
mind
hearing
about
it
jane
meant
to
stay
she
thought
that
if
she
was
gone
they
would
persuade
clare
she
had
dreamed
it
all
and
that
it
had
been
really
gideon
after
all
jane
asked
clare
why
she
had
pushed
oliver
thinking
that
she
ought
to
explain
and
not
cry
but
still
clare
only
cried
and
at
last
said
she
could
ever
tell
any
one
lady
pinkerton
turned
pink
and
lord
pinkerton
walked
up
and
down
and
said
tut
and
it
was
more
obvious
than
ever
what
clare
meant
she
added
i
never
meant
indeed
i
never
meant
to
hurt
him
he
just
fell
back
and
killed
jane
finished
for
her
jane
thought
clare
was
like
their
mother
in
trying
to
avoid
plain
words
for
disagreeable
things
clare
cried
and
cried
she
said
not
had
a
happy
moment
since
which
was
as
nearly
true
as
these
excessive
statements
ever
are
lady
pinkerton
tried
to
calm
her
and
said
poor
dear
child
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
you
must
go
to
bed
now
and
tell
us
in
the
morning
when
you
are
more
yourself
clare
did
go
to
bed
until
lord
pinkerton
had
promised
to
ring
up
the
then
she
went
with
lady
pinkerton
who
was
crying
too
now
because
she
was
beginning
to
believe
the
story
jane
did
know
what
she
believed
she
did
believe
what
clare
had
implied
that
oliver
had
tried
to
kiss
her
because
oliver
had
been
like
that
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
he
did
jane
thought
it
caddish
of
clare
to
have
tried
to
make
them
think
that
of
him
but
she
might
jane
thought
have
been
angry
with
him
about
something
else
she
might
have
pushed
him
or
she
might
not
she
might
be
imagining
or
inventing
the
whole
thing
you
never
knew
with
clare
if
it
was
true
jane
thought
she
had
been
a
fool
about
arthur
but
if
he
had
done
it
why
had
he
been
so
queer
why
had
he
avoided
her
and
been
so
odd
and
ashamed
from
the
first
morning
on
perhaps
thought
jane
he
had
suspected
clare
she
would
see
him
morning
and
ask
him
jane
saw
gideon
next
day
she
rang
him
up
and
he
came
over
to
hampstead
after
tea
it
was
the
first
time
jane
had
seen
him
alone
for
more
than
a
month
he
looked
thin
and
jane
loved
him
she
had
loved
him
through
everything
he
might
have
killed
oliver
it
made
no
difference
to
her
caring
for
him
but
she
hoped
he
had
he
came
into
the
jane
remembered
that
other
night
when
oliver
poor
oliver
had
been
vexed
to
find
him
there
poor
oliver
poor
oliver
but
jane
could
really
care
not
really
only
gently
and
in
a
way
that
did
hurt
not
as
if
gideon
were
dead
and
shut
away
from
everything
not
as
if
she
herself
were
jane
did
pretend
as
lady
pinkerton
would
say
the
claims
of
truth
were
inexorable
gideon
came
in
quickly
looking
grave
and
worried
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
jane
said
please
tell
me
you
knock
oliver
down
that
night
he
stood
and
stared
at
her
looking
astonished
and
startled
then
he
said
slowly
i
see
you
mean
am
i
going
to
admit
that
i
did
when
i
am
accused
if
there
no
other
way
out
i
am
it
will
be
all
right
jane
he
said
very
gently
need
be
afraid
jane
did
understand
him
you
did
it
she
said
and
sat
down
she
felt
sick
and
her
head
swam
gideon
stood
over
her
tall
and
stooping
biting
the
nail
of
his
middle
finger
see
jane
said
begun
to
hope
last
night
that
you
had
done
it
after
all
are
you
talking
about
he
asked
jane
said
told
us
that
it
happened
that
he
fell
after
you
had
left
the
house
so
i
hoped
she
might
be
speaking
the
truth
and
that
you
had
done
it
after
all
but
if
you
did
we
must
go
on
thinking
of
ways
out
i
did
gideon
said
after
her
slowly
know
i
did
jane
why
are
you
talking
like
this
what
the
use
when
i
know
and
you
know
and
you
know
that
i
know
the
truth
about
it
it
can
do
no
good
he
was
for
the
first
time
stern
and
angry
with
her
truth
jane
said
wish
you
tell
it
me
arthur
the
truth
if
gideon
told
her
anything
it
would
be
the
truth
she
knew
he
was
like
clare
who
could
but
he
only
looked
at
her
oddly
and
did
speak
jane
looked
back
into
his
eyes
trying
to
read
his
mind
and
so
for
a
moment
he
stared
down
at
her
and
she
stared
up
at
him
jane
perceived
that
he
had
not
done
it
had
he
then
guessed
all
this
time
that
clare
had
and
been
trying
to
shield
her
then
slowly
his
face
which
had
been
frowning
and
tense
changed
and
broke
up
god
he
said
me
the
truth
jane
it
you
was
it
then
jane
understood
she
said
thought
it
was
and
i
thought
it
was
you
is
it
me
you
been
so
ashamed
of
all
this
time
then
not
yourself
he
said
still
staring
at
her
course
it
you
then
and
you
thought
it
was
me
but
how
could
you
think
that
jane
i
have
told
i
would
have
been
such
a
silly
fool
as
to
sneak
away
and
say
nothing
you
might
have
known
that
you
must
have
had
a
pretty
poor
opinion
of
me
to
think
i
do
that
good
lord
how
you
must
have
loathed
me
all
this
time
i
have
have
you
loathed
me
then
he
said
quickly
different
but
he
did
explain
why
after
a
moment
he
said
was
just
an
accident
then
after
all
clare
was
talking
to
him
when
he
fell
she
only
just
told
about
it
because
you
were
being
suspected
but
i
never
know
whether
to
believe
clare
she
such
a
gumph
i
had
to
ask
you
what
made
you
suspect
by
the
way
manner
that
first
morning
you
dragged
me
into
the
do
you
remember
and
talked
about
how
they
all
thought
it
was
an
accident
and
no
one
would
guess
if
we
were
careful
and
i
was
to
say
anything
what
else
was
i
to
think
it
was
really
your
own
fault
jane
said
anyhow
we
quits
we
both
spent
six
weeks
thinking
each
other
murderers
now
we
stop
i
do
wonder
you
fought
shy
of
me
arthur
he
looked
at
her
curiously
you
fight
shy
of
me
then
you
can
hardly
have
wanted
to
see
much
of
me
in
the
circumstances
did
of
course
it
was
awful
besides
you
were
so
queer
and
disagreeable
i
thought
it
was
a
guilty
conscience
but
really
i
suppose
it
was
disgust
disgust
no
not
that
he
seemed
to
be
balancing
the
word
in
his
mind
considering
it
then
rejecting
it
he
said
would
have
been
difficult
to
pretend
nothing
had
happened
would
it
i
did
blame
you
you
know
for
the
thing
itself
i
knew
it
must
have
been
an
accident
that
you
never
meant
what
happened
well
anyhow
that
all
over
it
been
pretty
ghastly
let
forget
it
what
potterish
minds
you
and
i
must
have
jane
to
have
built
up
such
a
sensational
melodrama
out
of
an
ordinary
accident
i
think
lord
pinkerton
would
find
me
useful
on
one
of
his
papers
i
wasted
on
the
you
and
i
the
two
least
likely
people
in
the
world
for
such
fancies
think
except
katherine
by
the
way
katherine
half
thought
i
done
it
you
know
so
did
jukie
inclined
now
to
think
that
k
thought
i
had
that
evening
she
came
to
see
me
she
was
rather
sick
with
me
for
letting
you
be
accused
regular
potter
melodrama
said
gideon
might
be
in
one
of
your
mother
novels
or
your
father
papers
that
just
shows
jane
how
infectious
a
thing
potterism
is
it
invades
the
least
likely
homes
and
upsets
the
least
likely
lives
horrible
catching
disease
gideon
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
in
his
restless
way
playing
with
the
things
on
the
tables
he
stopped
suddenly
and
looked
at
jane
he
said
wo
you
and
i
have
any
more
secrets
and
concealments
between
us
they
rotten
things
next
time
it
occurs
to
you
that
i
committed
a
crime
ask
me
if
it
is
so
and
i
do
the
same
to
you
at
whatever
risk
of
being
offensive
we
begin
now
by
telling
each
other
what
we
feel
you
know
i
love
you
my
dear
oh
yes
jane
knew
that
she
said
suppose
i
do
arthur
he
said
what
about
it
do
you
and
she
said
of
course
i
do
then
they
kissed
each
other
and
settled
to
get
married
next
may
or
june
the
baby
was
coming
in
january
have
to
put
up
with
baby
you
know
arthur
jane
said
course
poor
little
kid
i
rather
like
them
it
rough
luck
on
it
not
having
a
father
of
its
own
i
try
to
be
decent
to
it
that
would
be
queer
thought
jane
arthur
being
decent
to
oliver
kid
a
boy
perhaps
with
oliver
face
and
oliver
mind
poor
little
kid
but
jane
would
love
it
and
arthur
would
be
decent
to
it
and
its
grandparents
would
spoil
it
it
would
be
their
favourite
if
any
more
came
they
would
like
the
others
because
they
would
be
gideon
they
might
look
like
little
yids
perhaps
there
would
be
any
others
jane
was
keen
they
were
all
right
when
they
were
there
jolly
little
comics
all
slippy
in
their
baths
like
eels
but
they
were
an
unspeakable
nuisance
while
on
the
way
a
rotten
system
all
next
day
jane
felt
like
stopping
people
in
the
streets
and
shouting
at
them
did
do
it
nor
did
i
it
was
only
that
silly
ass
clare
or
else
it
was
an
accident
for
even
now
jane
was
sure
which
she
thought
but
the
only
person
to
whom
she
really
said
it
was
katherine
one
told
katherine
things
because
she
was
as
deep
and
as
quiet
as
the
grave
also
if
jane
had
told
her
what
clare
had
said
she
would
have
gone
on
thinking
it
was
jane
and
jane
did
like
that
jane
did
not
care
to
give
katherine
more
reasons
for
making
her
feel
cheap
than
necessary
she
would
always
think
jane
cheap
anyhow
because
jane
only
cared
about
having
a
good
time
and
katherine
thought
one
should
care
chiefly
about
one
job
jane
supposed
she
was
cheap
but
did
much
care
she
felt
she
would
rather
be
herself
she
had
a
better
time
and
would
have
a
better
time
still
before
she
had
done
better
than
johnny
with
the
rubbishy
books
he
was
writing
and
making
his
firm
bring
out
for
him
and
feeling
so
pleased
with
jane
knew
she
could
write
better
stuff
than
johnny
could
any
day
and
her
books
would
be
in
addition
to
gideon
and
babies
and
other
amusing
things
jane
told
katherine
clare
story
katherine
said
perhaps
i
wonder
it
as
likely
as
not
all
bumkum
that
she
pushed
him
she
was
probably
talking
to
him
when
he
fell
and
got
worked
up
about
it
later
the
potter
press
and
leila
yorke
touch
however
you
never
know
quite
a
light
push
might
do
it
those
stairs
of
yours
are
awful
i
really
advise
you
to
be
careful
jane
thought
i
done
it
did
you
old
thing
a
bit
i
did
for
a
bit
i
thought
it
was
arthur
so
did
jukie
you
never
know
any
one
might
push
any
one
else
even
clare
may
have
must
have
thought
i
was
a
pretty
mean
little
beast
to
let
arthur
be
suspected
without
owning
up
did
katherine
admitted
she
was
looking
at
jane
in
her
considering
way
her
bright
blue
eyes
seemed
always
to
go
straight
through
what
she
was
looking
at
like
when
she
looked
at
jane
now
she
seemed
somehow
to
be
seeing
in
her
not
only
the
present
but
the
past
it
was
as
if
she
remembered
and
was
making
jane
remember
all
kinds
of
old
things
jane
had
done
things
she
had
done
at
oxford
things
she
had
done
since
things
katherine
neither
blamed
nor
condemned
but
just
took
into
consideration
when
thinking
what
sort
of
a
person
jane
was
you
had
the
same
feeling
with
katherine
that
you
had
sometimes
with
juke
of
being
analysed
and
understood
all
through
you
could
diddle
either
of
them
into
thinking
you
any
nicer
than
you
were
jane
did
want
to
it
was
more
restful
just
to
be
taken
for
what
one
was
oliver
had
been
always
idealising
her
gideon
did
do
that
he
knew
her
too
well
only
he
did
bother
much
about
what
she
was
not
being
either
a
priest
or
a
scientific
chemist
but
a
man
in
love
the
way
said
katherine
you
and
arthur
going
to
get
married
jane
told
her
in
may
or
june
katherine
who
was
lighting
a
cigarette
looked
at
jane
without
smiling
the
flame
of
the
match
shone
into
her
face
and
it
was
white
and
cold
and
quiet
does
think
i
good
enough
for
arthur
jane
thought
and
anyhow
k
did
jane
knew
think
much
of
marriage
at
all
most
women
if
you
said
you
were
going
to
get
married
assumed
it
was
a
good
thing
they
caught
hold
of
you
and
kissed
you
if
you
were
a
man
other
men
slapped
you
on
the
back
or
shook
hands
or
something
they
all
thought
or
pretended
to
think
it
was
a
fine
thing
you
were
doing
they
really
think
so
always
behind
their
eyes
you
could
often
see
them
thinking
other
things
about
it
wondering
if
you
would
like
it
or
why
you
chose
that
one
and
if
it
was
because
you
preferred
him
or
her
to
any
one
else
or
because
you
could
get
any
one
else
or
they
would
be
pitying
you
for
stopping
being
a
bachelor
or
spinster
and
having
to
grow
up
and
settle
down
and
support
a
wife
or
manage
servants
and
babies
but
all
that
was
behind
they
did
show
it
they
would
say
for
you
old
thing
and
kiss
you
or
shake
your
hand
katherine
did
neither
to
jane
she
had
when
it
was
oliver
hobart
because
she
had
thought
it
a
suitable
marriage
she
did
now
it
was
arthur
gideon
perhaps
for
the
same
reason
she
did
talk
about
it
she
talked
about
something
else
chapter
ii
engaged
to
be
married
the
fine
weather
ended
early
october
had
been
warm
full
of
golden
light
with
clear
still
evenings
later
the
wind
blustered
and
it
was
cold
sometimes
jane
felt
sick
that
was
the
baby
but
not
often
she
went
about
all
right
and
she
was
writing
journalism
and
a
novel
she
thought
she
would
perhaps
send
it
in
for
a
prize
novel
competition
in
the
spring
only
she
felt
no
certainty
of
pleasing
the
three
judges
all
so
very
dissimilar
jane
work
was
a
novel
about
a
girl
at
school
and
college
and
thereafter
perhaps
it
would
be
the
first
of
a
trilogy
perhaps
it
would
not
the
important
thing
was
that
it
should
be
well
reviewed
how
did
one
work
that
you
could
never
tell
some
things
were
well
reviewed
others
were
partly
luck
it
was
thought
jane
novels
were
better
treated
usually
than
they
deserved
verse
about
as
well
as
it
deserved
which
however
was
as
a
rule
saying
very
much
some
kinds
of
book
were
unkindly
used
anthologies
of
contemporary
verse
for
instance
someone
would
unselfishly
go
to
the
trouble
of
collecting
some
of
the
recent
poetical
output
which
he
or
she
personally
preferred
and
binding
it
up
in
a
pleasant
portable
volume
and
you
would
think
all
that
readers
had
to
do
was
to
read
what
they
liked
in
it
if
anything
and
leave
out
the
rest
and
be
grateful
instead
it
would
be
slated
by
reviewers
and
compared
to
the
royal
academy
and
to
a
literary
signpost
pointing
the
wrong
way
and
other
opprobrious
things
as
if
an
anthology
could
point
to
anything
but
the
taste
of
the
compiler
which
of
course
could
not
be
expected
to
agree
with
any
one
else
tastes
never
do
the
thing
was
thought
jane
to
hit
the
public
taste
with
the
right
thing
at
the
right
moment
another
thing
was
to
do
better
than
johnny
that
should
be
possible
because
jane
better
than
johnny
had
always
been
only
there
was
this
baby
which
made
her
feel
ill
before
it
came
and
would
need
care
and
attention
afterwards
it
was
fair
if
johnny
married
and
had
a
baby
it
would
get
in
his
way
only
in
its
mamma
it
was
a
handicap
like
your
frock
however
short
it
was
when
you
were
climbing
you
had
got
round
that
by
taking
it
off
and
climbing
in
knickerbockers
but
you
could
get
round
a
baby
and
jane
wanted
the
baby
too
suppose
i
want
everything
said
jane
johnny
wanted
everything
too
he
got
a
lot
he
got
love
he
was
polygamous
by
nature
and
usually
had
more
than
one
girl
on
hand
that
autumn
he
had
two
one
was
nancy
sharpe
the
violinist
they
were
always
about
together
people
who
did
know
either
of
them
well
thought
they
would
get
engaged
but
neither
of
them
wanted
that
the
other
girl
was
a
different
kind
the
lovely
painted
kind
you
do
meet
no
one
thought
johnny
would
marry
her
of
course
they
merely
passed
the
time
for
one
another
jane
wondered
if
the
equivalent
man
would
pass
the
time
for
her
she
did
think
so
she
thought
she
would
get
bored
with
never
talking
about
anything
interesting
and
it
must
she
thought
be
pretty
beastly
having
to
kiss
people
who
used
cheap
scent
and
painted
their
lips
one
would
be
afraid
the
red
stuff
would
come
off
in
fact
it
surely
would
did
men
mind
clean
men
like
johnny
men
are
so
different
thought
jane
johnny
was
the
same
at
oxford
he
would
flirt
with
girls
in
jane
had
never
wanted
to
flirt
with
the
waiters
in
restaurants
men
were
perhaps
less
critical
or
perhaps
they
wanted
different
qualities
in
those
with
whom
they
flirted
or
perhaps
it
was
that
their
amatory
instinct
when
pronounced
at
all
was
much
stronger
than
women
and
flowed
out
on
to
any
object
at
hand
when
they
were
in
the
mood
also
they
certainly
grew
up
earlier
at
oxford
and
cambridge
girls
were
for
the
most
part
enough
to
be
thinking
about
that
kind
of
thing
at
all
it
came
on
later
with
most
of
them
but
men
of
that
age
were
quite
a
lot
of
them
mature
enough
to
flirt
with
the
girls
in
buol
jane
discussed
it
with
gideon
one
evening
gideon
said
usually
have
as
a
rule
more
sex
feeling
than
women
that
all
naturally
they
need
more
to
carry
them
through
all
the
business
of
making
marriage
proposals
and
keeping
up
homes
and
so
on
women
often
have
very
little
that
why
they
often
better
at
friendship
than
men
are
a
woman
can
be
a
man
friend
all
their
lives
but
a
man
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
will
either
get
tired
of
it
or
want
more
women
have
a
tremendous
gift
for
friendship
their
friendships
with
other
women
are
usually
much
more
devoted
and
more
faithful
than
a
man
with
other
men
most
men
though
of
course
not
all
want
sex
in
their
lives
at
some
time
or
other
hundreds
of
women
are
quite
happy
without
it
they
quite
often
nearly
sexless
very
few
men
are
that
jane
said
are
plenty
of
women
like
clare
whom
one
ca
think
of
apart
from
sex
no
friendship
would
ever
satisfy
her
if
she
is
a
wife
and
mother
she
be
starved
she
marry
of
course
gideon
agreed
are
plenty
of
women
like
that
and
when
a
woman
is
like
that
she
much
more
dependent
on
love
and
marriage
than
any
man
is
because
she
usually
has
fewer
other
things
in
her
life
but
there
are
women
also
like
katherine
katherine
k
is
even
dependent
on
friendship
she
only
wants
her
work
k
is
typical
she
is
typical
she
is
a
channel
for
the
life
force
like
most
of
us
she
too
independent
she
wo
let
herself
be
used
in
that
way
i
a
channel
for
the
life
force
thought
jane
suppose
so
hence
oliver
and
baby
is
arthur
i
suppose
so
hence
his
wanting
to
marry
me
jane
told
her
family
that
she
was
going
to
marry
gideon
lady
pinkerton
said
extraordinary
to
me
that
you
can
think
of
it
jane
after
all
that
has
happened
surely
my
child
the
fact
that
it
was
the
last
thing
oliver
would
wish
should
have
some
weight
with
you
whatever
plane
he
may
be
on
now
he
must
be
disturbed
by
such
news
as
this
besides
dear
child
it
is
far
too
soon
you
should
wait
at
least
a
year
before
taking
such
a
step
and
arthur
gideon
not
only
a
jew
jane
and
not
only
a
man
of
such
very
unfortunate
political
principles
but
one
who
has
never
attempted
to
conceal
his
spiteful
hostility
both
to
father
papers
and
my
books
but
perhaps
as
i
believe
you
agree
with
him
in
despising
both
of
these
that
may
be
an
extra
bond
between
you
only
you
must
that
it
will
make
family
life
extremely
awkward
of
course
it
would
but
family
lives
nearly
always
are
awkward
jane
thought
it
is
one
of
the
things
about
them
lady
pinkerton
added
having
suddenly
remembered
it
my
dear
he
you
told
me
so
yourself
jane
said
if
she
had
she
had
lied
doubtless
for
some
good
reason
now
forgotten
by
her
he
did
drink
not
in
the
excessive
sense
of
that
word
obviously
intended
by
lady
pinkerton
lady
pinkerton
was
unconvinced
she
still
was
sure
he
drank
in
that
sense
she
resumed
jewish
babies
i
wonder
you
can
think
of
it
jane
they
may
be
a
to
a
most
degraded
type
what
brothers
and
sisters
for
the
dear
mite
who
is
coming
first
my
dear
i
do
beg
you
to
think
this
over
long
and
seriously
before
committing
yourself
you
may
live
to
repent
it
bitterly
clare
said
how
you
after
after
oliver
she
meant
she
would
never
say
his
name
perhaps
one
does
like
to
when
one
has
killed
a
man
jane
thought
did
i
leave
oliver
to
clare
she
have
suited
him
much
better
i
was
stupid
i
thought
i
wanted
him
i
did
want
him
but
not
in
the
way
i
want
arthur
now
one
wants
so
many
things
lord
pinkerton
said
making
a
big
mistake
babs
that
fellow
wo
last
he
building
on
sand
as
the
bible
puts
it
building
on
sand
i
hear
on
good
authority
that
the
ca
go
on
many
months
longer
unless
it
changes
its
tone
and
methods
considerably
it
got
no
chance
of
fighting
its
way
as
it
is
now
people
do
want
that
kind
of
thing
they
do
want
anything
the
gideon
lot
will
give
them
gideon
and
his
sort
have
got
the
goods
they
building
on
the
sand
of
their
own
fancy
not
on
the
rock
of
general
human
demand
i
hear
that
that
daily
they
talked
of
starting
ca
come
off
yet
either
the
chap
a
bad
investment
babs
and
he
despises
me
and
my
goods
you
know
be
awkward
you
daddy
the
papers
he
does
he
rather
likes
you
though
he
does
approve
of
you
he
does
like
mother
and
she
does
like
him
but
people
often
do
get
on
with
their
an
awkward
alliance
my
dear
a
very
awkward
alliance
what
will
people
say
besides
he
a
jew
jewish
babies
he
was
thinking
of
them
too
jane
thought
bother
the
babies
perhaps
there
would
be
any
and
if
there
were
they
only
be
a
quarter
jew
anyhow
it
was
them
she
wanted
it
was
arthur
arthur
opened
doors
and
windows
you
got
to
the
edge
of
your
own
thought
and
then
stepped
out
beyond
into
his
thought
and
his
thought
drove
sharp
and
hard
into
space
but
more
than
this
jane
loved
the
way
his
hair
grew
and
the
black
line
his
eyebrows
made
across
his
forehead
and
the
way
he
stood
tall
and
lean
and
slouching
and
his
keen
thin
face
and
his
long
thin
hands
and
the
way
his
mouth
twisted
up
when
he
smiled
and
his
voice
and
the
whole
of
him
she
wondered
if
he
loved
her
like
that
if
he
turned
hot
and
cold
when
he
saw
her
in
the
distance
she
believed
that
he
did
love
her
like
that
he
had
loved
her
as
she
had
loved
him
all
that
time
he
had
thought
she
was
lying
to
every
one
about
oliver
death
is
what
people
do
said
jane
makes
one
love
them
or
stop
loving
them
this
she
thought
clare
felt
for
oliver
i
did
know
it
was
like
this
or
i
would
have
taken
him
from
her
poor
old
clare
could
one
love
oliver
like
that
any
one
jane
supposed
could
be
loved
like
that
by
the
right
person
and
people
like
clare
loved
more
intensely
than
people
like
her
they
felt
more
and
had
fewer
other
occupations
jane
had
known
that
she
could
feel
so
much
about
anything
as
she
was
feeling
now
about
gideon
it
was
interesting
she
wondered
how
long
it
would
last
at
this
pitch
chapter
iii
the
precisian
at
war
with
the
world
jane
baby
was
born
in
january
as
far
as
babies
can
be
like
grown
human
beings
it
was
like
its
grandfather
a
little
potter
lord
pinkerton
was
pleased
shall
carry
on
the
papers
he
said
dandling
it
on
his
arm
grandson
he
dug
it
softly
in
the
ribs
he
understood
this
baby
however
many
little
yids
jane
might
achieve
in
the
future
there
would
be
this
little
potter
to
carry
on
his
own
dreams
clare
came
to
see
it
she
was
glad
it
was
like
oliver
jane
saw
her
being
glad
of
that
she
was
beginning
to
fall
in
love
with
a
young
naval
officer
but
still
she
could
have
seen
oliver
in
jane
child
without
wincing
gideon
came
to
see
it
he
laughed
for
ever
he
said
he
added
symbolic
potters
will
be
for
ever
you
know
they
so
strong
the
light
from
the
foggy
winter
afternoon
fell
on
his
face
as
he
sat
by
the
window
he
looked
tired
and
perplexed
strength
perpetuity
seemed
things
remote
from
him
belonging
only
to
potters
and
the
were
frail
things
of
a
day
rooted
in
a
dream
so
gideon
felt
on
these
days
when
the
fog
closed
about
him
jane
looked
at
her
son
the
strange
little
animal
and
thought
not
for
ever
but
for
ever
as
was
natural
and
as
parents
will
think
of
their
young
who
will
carry
them
down
the
ages
in
an
ever
more
distant
but
never
lost
immortality
an
atom
of
dust
borne
on
the
hurrying
stream
jane
who
believed
in
no
other
personal
immortality
found
it
in
this
little
potter
in
her
arms
holding
him
close
she
loved
him
in
a
curious
new
physical
way
so
this
was
motherhood
this
queer
sensuous
cherishing
love
it
would
have
been
a
pity
not
to
have
known
it
it
was
after
all
an
emotion
more
profound
than
most
when
jane
was
well
enough
she
gave
a
party
for
charles
as
if
he
had
been
a
new
picture
she
had
painted
and
wanted
to
show
off
her
friends
came
and
looked
at
him
and
thought
how
clever
of
her
to
have
had
him
all
complete
and
alive
and
jolly
like
that
a
real
baby
he
was
better
than
the
books
and
things
they
wrote
because
he
was
more
alive
and
would
also
last
longer
with
luck
their
books
would
have
a
run
of
four
score
years
and
ten
or
whatever
it
was
they
be
lucky
if
any
one
thought
of
them
again
in
five
years
but
partly
jane
gave
the
party
to
show
people
that
charles
monopolise
her
that
she
was
well
and
active
again
and
ready
for
work
and
life
if
she
was
careful
she
might
come
to
be
regarded
as
the
mere
mother
and
dropped
out
johnny
said
grinning
amiably
at
her
and
charles
thinking
that
your
masterpiece
quite
puts
mine
in
the
shade
you
old
thing
he
had
a
novel
just
out
it
was
as
good
as
most
young
men
first
novels
not
sure
said
jane
charles
is
my
masterpiece
wait
till
the
other
works
appear
and
i
tell
you
johnny
grinned
more
supposing
that
she
meant
the
little
yids
books
i
mean
jane
added
quickly
your
books
going
to
be
better
than
yours
my
dear
said
jane
and
see
but
i
dare
say
they
wo
be
as
good
as
this
she
appraised
charles
with
her
eyes
oh
so
much
less
trouble
she
added
swinging
him
up
and
down
could
have
one
as
good
as
that
said
johnny
thoughtfully
no
trouble
at
all
have
to
work
for
it
and
keep
it
and
its
mother
you
would
like
that
you
know
of
course
you
ought
to
it
your
duty
every
young
man
who
survives
daddy
says
so
you
better
do
it
john
getting
on
you
know
young
men
hate
getting
on
they
hate
it
really
more
than
young
women
do
youth
is
of
such
immense
value
in
almost
any
career
but
particularly
to
the
young
writer
but
johnny
only
said
with
apparent
nonchalance
is
not
very
old
he
added
however
you
five
minutes
older
and
i
published
a
book
if
you
have
produced
that
thing
johnny
was
frankly
greedy
about
his
book
he
hung
on
reviews
he
asked
for
it
in
bookshops
and
expressed
astonishment
and
contempt
when
they
had
not
got
it
and
it
was
after
all
nothing
to
make
a
song
about
jane
thought
it
was
positively
discreditable
to
its
writer
like
most
novels
but
it
was
a
very
normal
book
by
a
very
normal
cleverish
young
man
johnny
was
sure
that
his
publishers
advertised
it
as
much
as
was
desirable
gideon
came
up
to
jane
and
charles
he
had
just
arrived
he
had
three
evening
papers
in
his
hand
his
fellow
passengers
had
left
them
in
the
train
and
he
had
collected
them
jews
often
get
their
news
that
way
johnny
saw
his
friend
miss
nancy
sharpe
disengaged
and
looking
lovely
and
went
to
speak
to
her
he
was
really
in
love
with
her
a
little
though
he
did
go
as
far
as
wanting
to
work
for
her
and
keep
her
he
was
quite
right
that
is
to
go
too
far
when
so
much
happiness
is
attainable
short
of
it
johnny
wisely
shunned
desperate
measures
so
to
do
her
justice
did
miss
sharpe
very
elated
said
jane
to
gideon
looking
after
him
do
think
of
his
book
arthur
gideon
said
do
think
of
it
i
had
no
reason
to
particularly
i
not
had
to
review
it
i
afraid
i
hopeless
about
novels
just
now
that
the
fact
i
sick
of
the
form
slices
of
life
served
up
cold
in
three
hundred
pages
oh
it
very
nice
it
makes
nice
reading
for
people
but
what
the
use
except
of
course
to
kill
time
for
those
who
prefer
it
dead
but
as
things
in
themselves
as
art
they
been
ruined
by
excess
my
critical
sense
is
blunted
just
now
i
can
hardly
feel
the
difference
though
i
see
it
between
a
good
novel
and
a
bad
one
i
could
write
one
good
or
bad
to
save
my
life
i
know
that
and
got
to
the
stage
when
i
wish
other
people
would
i
wish
every
one
would
shut
up
so
that
we
could
hear
ourselves
think
like
in
the
armistice
day
pause
when
all
the
noise
stopped
jane
shook
her
head
may
be
sure
we
sha
do
that
not
likely
we
all
want
to
hear
ourselves
talk
and
quite
right
too
we
got
things
to
say
of
importance
few
things
that
would
be
better
unsaid
life
is
talking
journalist
is
jane
pointed
out
and
he
nodded
true
horribly
true
it
chiefly
myself
i
hitting
at
but
at
least
we
journalists
do
take
ourselves
solemnly
we
know
our
stuff
is
babble
to
fill
a
moment
novelists
and
poets
do
always
know
that
they
apt
to
think
it
matters
and
of
course
so
far
as
any
of
them
can
make
and
hold
beauty
even
a
fragment
of
it
here
and
there
it
does
matter
the
trouble
is
that
they
mostly
ca
do
anything
of
the
sort
they
do
mostly
even
know
how
to
try
all
but
a
few
are
shallow
muddled
or
sentimental
and
most
novelists
are
commercial
as
well
they
have
the
means
they
are
adequately
equipped
nothing
in
them
worth
the
saying
why
say
it
then
a
little
cleverness
is
worth
while
morbid
arthur
diseased
i
dare
say
we
most
of
us
are
what
health
after
all
no
one
knows
done
eighty
thousand
words
of
my
novel
anyhow
sorry
nearly
all
novels
are
too
long
all
you
got
to
say
would
go
into
forty
thousand
do
write
because
i
got
things
to
say
i
have
a
message
like
mother
i
write
because
it
amuses
me
and
because
i
like
to
be
a
novelist
it
done
and
i
like
to
be
well
spoken
of
reasonably
well
that
is
it
all
fun
why
not
do
ask
why
not
i
ca
preach
sermons
all
the
evening
he
smiled
down
on
her
out
of
his
long
sad
black
eyes
glad
of
her
because
she
saw
straight
and
never
canted
impatient
of
her
because
her
ideals
were
commercial
loving
her
because
she
was
and
and
desirable
seeing
her
much
as
nancy
sharpe
who
lived
for
music
saw
johnny
potter
only
with
ardour
instead
of
nonchalance
such
ardour
indeed
that
his
thoughts
of
her
only
intermittently
achieved
exactitude
two
girls
came
up
to
admire
charles
jane
said
it
was
time
she
took
him
to
bed
and
they
went
up
with
her
gideon
turned
away
he
hated
parties
and
seldom
went
even
to
jane
he
stood
drinking
coffee
and
watching
people
you
met
most
of
them
at
the
club
and
elsewhere
continually
why
meet
them
all
again
in
a
there
was
his
sister
rosalind
and
her
husband
boris
stefan
with
their
handsome
faces
and
masses
of
black
hair
rosalind
had
a
baby
too
at
home
a
delicate
pretty
thing
like
manchester
mother
and
charles
was
like
jane
birmingham
father
it
was
manchester
and
birmingham
that
persisted
not
palestine
or
russia
and
there
was
juke
with
his
white
amused
face
and
eyes
that
seemed
always
to
see
a
long
way
and
katherine
varick
talking
to
a
naval
officer
about
periscopes
jane
kept
in
with
some
of
the
admiralty
and
peacock
with
whom
gideon
had
quarrelled
two
hours
ago
at
the
office
and
who
was
now
in
the
middle
of
a
group
of
writing
young
men
as
usual
gideon
looked
at
him
cynically
peacock
was
letting
himself
be
got
at
by
a
clique
gideon
would
rather
have
seen
him
talking
to
the
practical
looking
sailor
about
periscopes
peacock
would
have
to
be
watched
he
had
shown
signs
lately
of
colouring
the
with
prejudices
he
was
getting
in
with
a
push
he
was
dangerously
in
the
movement
he
was
also
leaning
romancewards
and
departing
from
the
realm
of
pure
truth
he
had
given
credence
to
some
strange
travellers
tales
of
foreign
office
iniquities
as
if
that
unfortunate
and
misguided
body
had
not
enough
sins
to
its
account
without
having
melodramatic
and
uncharacteristic
kidnappings
and
deeds
of
violence
attributed
to
it
but
peacock
had
got
in
with
those
unhappy
journalists
and
others
who
had
been
viewing
russia
and
barely
escaping
with
their
lives
had
come
back
with
nothing
else
and
least
of
all
with
that
accurate
habit
of
mind
which
would
have
qualified
them
as
contributors
to
the
it
was
not
their
fault
except
for
going
to
russia
but
peacock
should
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
katherine
varick
crossed
the
room
to
gideon
with
a
faint
smile
enjoying
life
that
say
what
are
you
doing
with
the
gideon
looked
at
her
sourly
you
noticed
it
too
it
becoming
quite
pretty
reading
is
it
less
like
a
blue
book
less
i
should
say
it
was
beginning
to
appeal
to
a
wider
circle
is
that
the
idea
ask
me
ask
peacock
whatever
the
idea
is
it
his
not
mine
but
it
not
a
considered
idea
at
all
it
merely
a
yielding
to
the
apparently
irresistible
pressure
of
atmosphere
see
a
truce
with
the
potter
armies
there
no
such
thing
as
a
truce
with
them
it
the
first
steps
of
a
retreat
he
said
it
sharply
and
suddenly
in
the
way
of
a
man
who
is
at
the
moment
making
a
discovery
he
turned
and
looked
across
the
room
at
peacock
who
was
talking
and
talking
in
his
clever
keen
pleasant
way
not
in
the
least
like
a
blue
book
like
blue
books
gideon
muttered
sadly
any
one
is
unfortunate
very
unfortunate
what
one
to
do
about
it
pinkerton
would
say
learn
human
nature
as
it
is
and
build
on
it
exploit
its
weaknesses
instead
of
tilting
against
them
accept
sentimentality
and
prejudice
and
use
them
am
aware
that
he
would
what
do
say
katherine
what
the
use
i
one
of
the
blue
books
not
a
fair
judge
therefore
you
make
no
terms
ever
never
been
tempted
one
may
have
to
make
terms
sometimes
think
not
said
gideon
think
one
never
is
obliged
to
make
terms
the
enemy
is
too
strong
one
goes
under
gets
out
of
it
that
not
making
terms
i
going
home
i
hate
parties
you
know
so
do
you
why
do
either
of
us
go
to
them
take
one
thoughts
off
said
katherine
in
her
own
mind
her
blue
eyes
contracted
as
she
looked
after
him
failing
he
being
hurt
he
go
under
he
should
have
been
a
scientist
or
a
scholar
or
a
chemist
like
me
something
in
which
knowledge
matters
and
people
do
people
will
break
his
heart
gideon
walked
all
the
way
back
from
hampstead
to
his
own
rooms
it
was
a
soft
damp
night
full
of
little
winds
that
blew
into
the
city
from
february
fields
and
muddy
roads
far
off
there
would
be
lambs
in
the
fields
gideon
suddenly
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
town
into
that
damp
dark
country
that
circled
it
there
would
be
fewer
people
there
fewer
minds
crowded
together
making
a
dense
atmosphere
that
was
impervious
to
the
piercing
however
sharp
of
truth
all
this
dense
mass
of
stupid
muddled
huddled
minds
what
was
to
be
done
with
it
greedy
minds
ignorant
minds
sentimental
truthless
minds
he
saw
as
he
passed
a
newspaper
stand
placards
in
big
black
letters
suicide
of
baronet
then
small
and
inconspicuous
hardly
hoping
for
attention
and
the
adriatic
for
one
person
who
would
care
about
italy
and
the
adriatic
there
would
presumably
be
a
hundred
who
would
care
about
the
bride
and
the
baronet
presumably
else
why
the
placards
gideon
honestly
tried
to
bend
his
impersonal
and
political
mind
to
understand
it
he
knew
no
such
people
yet
one
had
to
believe
they
existed
people
who
really
cared
that
a
bride
with
whom
they
had
no
acquaintance
why
a
bride
did
that
make
her
more
interesting
had
taken
her
life
and
that
a
baronet
also
a
perfect
stranger
had
had
his
marriage
dissolved
in
a
court
of
law
what
quality
did
it
indicate
this
curious
and
inexplicable
interest
in
these
topics
so
tedious
to
himself
and
to
most
of
his
personal
acquaintances
was
it
a
love
of
romance
but
what
romance
was
to
be
found
in
suicide
or
divorce
romance
gideon
knew
knew
how
it
girdled
the
world
heard
the
beat
of
its
steps
in
far
forests
the
whisper
of
its
wings
on
dark
seas
it
is
there
not
in
divorces
and
suicides
were
people
perhaps
moved
by
desire
to
hear
about
the
misfortunes
of
others
no
because
they
also
welcomed
with
eagerness
the
more
cheerful
domestic
episodes
reported
was
it
then
some
fundamental
elemental
interest
in
fundamental
things
such
as
love
hate
birth
death
that
was
possibly
it
the
relation
of
states
one
with
another
are
the
product
of
civilisation
and
need
an
at
least
rudimentarily
political
brain
to
grasp
them
the
relations
of
human
beings
are
natural
and
only
need
the
human
heart
for
their
understanding
that
part
of
man
mind
which
has
been
for
some
obscure
reason
inaccurately
called
the
heart
was
enormously
and
disproportionately
stronger
than
the
rest
of
the
mind
the
thinking
part
caught
bending
another
placard
remarked
that
was
more
cheerful
though
it
was
an
idiotic
way
of
putting
a
theory
as
to
the
curvature
of
space
but
it
was
refreshing
that
apparently
people
were
expected
to
be
excited
by
that
too
and
gideon
knew
it
they
were
einstein
theory
as
to
space
and
light
would
be
discussed
with
varying
degrees
of
intelligence
most
of
them
low
in
many
a
cottage
many
a
club
many
a
train
there
would
be
columns
about
it
in
the
sunday
papers
with
little
sunday
remarks
to
the
effect
that
the
finiteness
of
space
did
not
limit
the
infinity
of
god
scientists
have
naïf
minds
where
god
is
concerned
they
see
him
if
at
all
in
terms
of
space
anyhow
there
it
was
people
were
interested
not
only
in
divorce
suicide
and
murder
but
in
light
and
space
undulations
and
gravitation
that
was
rather
jolly
for
that
was
true
romance
it
gave
one
more
hope
even
though
people
might
like
their
science
in
cheap
and
absurd
tabloid
form
they
did
like
it
the
potter
press
exulted
in
scientific
discoveries
made
easy
but
it
was
better
than
not
exulting
in
them
at
all
for
these
were
things
as
they
were
and
therefore
the
things
that
mattered
this
was
the
satisfying
world
of
hard
difficult
facts
without
slush
and
without
sentiment
this
was
the
world
where
truth
was
sought
for
its
own
sake
i
see
truth
do
i
seek
truth
only
that
i
may
things
denote
and
rich
by
striving
deck
my
youth
as
with
a
vain
unusual
coat
nearly
every
one
in
the
ordinary
world
did
that
if
indeed
they
ever
concerned
themselves
with
truth
at
all
and
some
scientists
too
perhaps
but
not
most
scientists
and
scholars
and
explorers
they
were
the
people
they
were
the
world
students
the
learners
the
discoverers
they
did
talk
till
they
knew
rain
had
begun
to
drizzle
at
the
corner
of
marylebone
road
and
baker
street
there
was
a
lit
a
group
clustered
about
it
a
policeman
drinking
oxo
his
waterproof
cape
shining
with
wet
two
drivers
having
coffee
and
buns
a
girl
in
an
evening
cloak
with
a
despatch
case
eating
biscuits
gideon
passed
by
without
stopping
a
hand
touched
him
on
the
arm
and
a
painted
face
looked
up
into
his
murmuring
something
gideon
who
had
a
particular
dislike
for
paint
on
the
human
face
and
in
general
for
persons
who
looked
and
behaved
like
this
person
looked
away
from
her
and
scowled
only
wanted
she
explained
cup
of
coffee
and
he
gave
her
sixpence
though
he
did
believe
her
horrible
these
women
were
ugly
dirty
loathsome
so
that
one
wondered
why
on
earth
any
one
liked
them
some
people
obviously
did
like
them
or
they
would
be
there
and
yet
detestable
as
they
were
they
were
the
outcome
of
facts
possibly
in
them
and
in
the
world
other
ugly
facts
potterism
and
all
found
whatever
justification
it
had
sentimentalism
spread
a
rosy
veil
over
the
ugliness
draping
it
decently
making
it
thought
gideon
how
much
worse
but
making
it
such
as
potterites
could
face
unwincing
the
rain
beat
down
at
its
soft
chill
touch
gideon
brain
cooled
and
cooled
till
he
seemed
to
see
everything
in
a
cold
hard
crystal
clarity
life
and
death
how
little
they
mattered
life
was
paltry
and
death
its
end
yet
when
the
world
the
potterish
world
dealt
with
death
it
became
something
other
than
a
mere
end
it
became
a
sensation
a
problem
an
episode
in
a
melodrama
the
question
when
a
man
died
was
always
how
and
why
so
when
hobart
had
died
they
were
all
dragged
into
a
net
of
suspicion
and
melodrama
they
all
became
for
a
time
absurd
actors
in
an
absurd
serial
in
the
potter
press
you
could
not
escape
from
sensationalism
in
a
sensational
world
there
was
no
room
for
the
pedant
with
his
greed
for
unadorned
and
unemotional
precision
gideon
sighed
sharply
as
he
turned
into
oxford
street
oxford
street
was
and
is
horrible
everything
a
street
should
not
be
even
when
it
was
down
and
now
it
was
up
which
was
far
worse
if
gideon
had
not
been
unnerved
by
the
painted
person
at
the
corner
of
baker
street
he
would
never
have
gone
home
this
way
he
would
have
gone
along
marylebone
and
euston
road
as
it
was
he
got
into
a
bus
and
rode
unhappily
to
inn
road
where
he
lived
he
sat
up
till
three
in
the
morning
working
out
statistics
for
an
article
statistics
figures
were
delightful
they
were
a
rest
they
mattered
two
days
later
at
the
office
peacock
turning
over
galley
slips
said
thing
of
yours
on
esthonian
food
conditions
looks
like
a
government
schedule
could
you
make
it
more
attractive
whom
asked
gideon
the
ordinary
reader
the
ordinary
reader
i
meant
it
to
be
attractive
to
people
who
want
information
but
a
little
jam
with
the
powder
for
instance
you
draw
no
inference
from
your
facts
it
dull
why
not
round
the
thing
off
into
a
good
article
ca
round
things
i
do
like
them
round
either
i
given
the
facts
unearthed
with
considerable
trouble
and
pains
no
one
else
has
is
it
enough
it
do
peacock
eyes
glanced
over
the
other
proofs
on
his
desk
got
some
good
stuff
this
number
round
articles
yes
gideon
turned
the
slips
over
with
his
lean
brown
fingers
carelessly
he
picked
one
up
i
did
know
that
chap
was
reviewing
and
he
asked
if
he
could
you
think
he
knows
enough
quite
a
good
review
read
it
gideon
read
it
carefully
then
laid
it
down
and
said
do
agree
with
you
that
it
a
good
review
he
made
at
least
two
mistakes
and
the
whole
thing
biased
by
his
personal
political
theories
enough
to
give
it
colour
do
want
colour
in
a
review
of
a
book
of
that
sort
you
only
want
intelligence
and
exact
knowledge
clitherton
all
right
his
head
screwed
on
the
right
way
he
knows
his
subject
well
enough
he
a
political
theorist
not
a
good
economist
hopeless
why
did
you
get
hinkson
to
do
it
ca
write
for
nuts
matter
hinkson
would
have
slipped
up
over
his
figures
or
dates
dear
old
chap
writing
does
matter
you
going
crazy
on
that
subject
of
course
it
matters
that
a
thing
should
be
decently
put
together
matters
much
more
that
it
should
be
well
informed
it
is
of
course
quite
possible
to
be
both
quite
that
the
idea
of
the
after
all
i
hate
all
these
slipshod
fellows
you
get
now
i
wish
chuck
the
lot
they
well
enough
for
most
journalism
but
they
know
enough
for
us
peacock
said
we
thrash
it
out
another
time
if
you
do
mind
i
got
to
get
through
some
letters
now
and
rang
for
his
secretary
gideon
went
to
his
own
room
and
searched
old
files
for
the
verification
and
correction
of
clitherton
mistakes
he
found
them
and
made
a
note
of
them
unfortunately
they
weakened
clitherton
argument
a
little
clitherton
would
have
to
modify
it
clitherton
a
sweeping
and
wholesale
person
would
not
like
that
gideon
was
feeling
annoyed
with
clitherton
and
annoyed
with
several
others
among
that
week
contributors
and
especially
annoyed
with
peacock
who
permitted
and
encouraged
them
if
they
went
on
like
this
the
would
soon
be
popular
it
would
find
its
way
into
the
great
soft
silly
heart
of
the
public
and
there
be
damned
he
was
a
pathetic
figure
arthur
gideon
the
intolerant
precisian
fighting
savagely
against
the
tide
of
loose
thinking
that
he
saw
surging
in
upon
him
swamping
the
world
and
drowning
facts
he
did
not
see
himself
as
a
pathetic
figure
or
as
anything
else
he
did
not
see
himself
at
all
but
worked
away
at
his
desk
in
the
foggy
room
checking
the
unconsidered
or
inaccurate
or
oversimplified
statements
of
others
writing
his
own
section
of
the
notes
of
the
week
with
his
careful
patient
fined
brilliance
stopping
to
gnaw
his
pen
or
his
or
to
draw
diagrams
triangle
within
triangle
or
circle
intersecting

on
his
blotting
paper
chapter
iv
running
away
a
week
later
gideon
resigned
his
assistant
editorship
of
the
peacock
was
on
the
whole
relieved
gideon
had
been
getting
too
difficult
of
late
after
some
casting
about
among
eager
outwardly
indifferent
possible
successors
peacock
offered
the
job
to
johnny
potter
who
was
swimming
on
the
tide
of
his
first
novel
which
had
been
what
is
called
spoken
of
by
the
press
but
who
at
the
same
time
had
the
popular
touch
was
quite
a
competent
journalist
was
looking
out
for
a
job
and
was
young
enough
to
do
what
he
was
told
that
is
to
say
he
was
four
or
five
years
younger
than
peacock
he
had
also
a
fervent
enthusiasm
for
democratic
principles
and
for
peacock
prose
style
gideon
had
been
temperate
in
his
admiration
of
both
and
peacock
thought
they
would
get
on
very
well
jane
was
sulky
jealous
and
contemptuous
why
johnny
he
not
so
good
as
lots
of
other
people
who
would
have
liked
the
job
he
swanking
so
already
that
it
makes
me
tired
to
be
in
the
room
with
him
and
now
he
be
worse
than
ever
oh
arthur
it
is
rot
your
chucking
it
i
a
jolly
good
mind
not
to
marry
you
i
thought
i
was
marrying
the
assistant
editor
of
an
important
paper
not
just
a
lazy
old
jew
without
a
job
she
ruffled
up
his
black
untidy
hair
with
her
hand
as
she
sat
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
but
she
was
really
annoyed
with
him
as
she
had
explained
a
week
ago
when
he
had
told
her
he
had
walked
in
one
evening
and
found
her
in
charles
bedroom
bathing
him
clare
was
there
too
helping
do
girls
like
washing
babies
gideon
speculated
aloud
nearly
all
do
do
they
i
should
just
so
clare
said
she
was
kneeling
by
the
tin
bath
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
holding
a
warmed
towel
her
face
was
flushed
from
the
fire
and
her
hair
was
loosened
where
charles
had
caught
his
toe
in
it
she
looked
pretty
and
maternal
and
looked
up
at
gideon
with
the
kind
of
conventional
scorn
that
girls
and
women
put
on
when
men
talk
of
babies
they
do
it
one
believes
partly
because
they
feel
it
is
a
subject
they
know
about
and
partly
to
pander
to
desire
that
they
should
do
it
it
is
part
of
the
pretty
play
between
the
sexes
jane
never
did
it
she
was
feminine
enough
and
gideon
did
not
want
her
to
do
it
he
thought
it
silly
do
you
hope
so
asked
gideon
why
do
girls
like
it
the
first
question
was
to
clare
the
second
to
jane
because
he
knew
that
clare
would
not
be
able
to
answer
it
mites
said
clare
like
it
gideon
sighed
a
little
clare
tried
him
she
had
an
amorphous
mind
but
jane
threw
up
at
him
as
she
enveloped
charles
in
the
towel
try
and
think
it
out
some
time
arthur
i
have
time
now
there
a
reason
all
right
the
powder
clare
gideon
watched
the
absurd
drying
and
powdering
process
with
gravity
and
interest
as
if
trying
to
discover
its
charm
katherine
enjoys
it
he
said
still
pondering
it
was
true
katherine
who
liked
experimenting
with
chemicals
liked
also
washing
babies
possibly
katherine
knew
why
in
both
cases
after
charles
was
in
bed
his
mother
his
aunt
and
his
prospective
stepfather
had
dinner
clare
who
was
uncomfortable
with
gideon
not
liking
him
as
a
or
indeed
as
anything
else
besides
not
being
sure
how
much
jane
had
told
him
about
awful
night
chattered
to
jane
about
things
of
which
she
thought
gideon
knew
nothing
dances
plays
friends
family
and
potters
bar
gossip
gideon
became
very
silent
he
and
clare
touched
nowhere
clare
flaunted
the
family
papers
in
his
face
and
jane
lord
pinkerton
was
starting
a
new
one
a
weekly
and
it
promised
to
sell
better
than
any
other
weekly
on
the
market
but
far
better
says
the
orders
have
been
simply
stunning
it
going
to
be
a
big
thing
simple
you
know
and
yet
clever
like
all
dad
papers
david
says
david
was
the
naval
officer
to
whom
clare
was
now
betrothed
with
such
a
sense
of
what
people
want
as
dad
has
far
more
of
it
than
northcliffe
david
says
he
has
because
you
know
northcliffe
sometimes
annoys
people
look
at
the
line
he
took
about
us
helping
the
russians
to
fight
each
other
and
making
out
in
leaders
david
says
that
the
government
is
always
wrong
just
because
he
like
it
and
drawing
attention
to
the
mistakes
it
makes
which
no
one
would
notice
if
they
were
rubbed
in
david
gets
quite
sick
with
him
sometimes
he
says
the
pinkerton
press
never
does
that
sort
of
thing
it
got
too
much
tact
and
lets
well
alone
you
mean
do
you
darling
jane
interpolated
clare
who
did
but
did
not
know
it
only
said
got
a
tremendous
admiration
for
it
he
says
it
will
bother
the
paternal
press
jane
said
it
a
rest
old
thing
it
may
be
new
to
david
but
it
stale
to
us
it
arthur
turn
to
talk
about
his
father
bank
or
something
but
arthur
did
talk
he
only
made
bread
pills
and
the
girls
got
on
to
the
newest
dance
clare
went
away
after
dinner
she
never
stayed
long
when
gideon
was
there
david
did
like
gideon
rightly
thinking
him
a
sheeney
are
at
the
bottom
of
bolshevism
you
know
he
told
clare
the
top
too
for
that
matter
dreadful
fellows
quite
dreadful
why
the
dickens
do
you
let
jane
marry
him
clare
shrugged
her
shoulders
does
what
she
likes
dad
and
mother
have
begged
and
prayed
her
not
to
besides
of
course
even
if
he
was
all
right
it
too
soon
ah
yes
of
course
poor
hobart
you
mean
quite
much
too
soon
a
dreadful
business
that
i
do
blame
her
for
trying
to
put
it
behind
her
out
of
sight
but
with
a
well
a
son
goût
for
david
was
tolerant
a
live
and
let
live
man
when
clare
was
gone
jane
said
up
old
man
you
can
talk
now
you
and
clare
are
stupid
about
each
other
by
the
way
you
have
to
get
over
it
some
time
you
and
she
a
silly
fool
but
people
and
silly
fools
can
rub
along
together
all
right
if
they
try
do
mind
clare
said
gideon
rousing
himself
was
thinking
about
her
to
say
the
truth
i
was
thinking
about
something
else
chucking
the
jane
mean
chucking
the
jane
lit
a
cigarette
i
say
i
resigned
my
job
on
it
i
sick
of
it
sick
every
one
sick
of
work
naturally
it
what
work
is
for
well
what
are
you
doing
next
have
you
been
offered
a
better
job
not
been
offered
a
job
of
any
sort
and
i
should
take
it
if
i
were
not
at
present
i
sick
of
journalism
jane
took
it
calmly
lying
back
among
the
sofa
cushions
and
smoking
was
afraid
you
were
working
up
to
this
of
course
if
you
chuck
the
you
take
away
its
last
chance
it
do
a
now
doing
it
anyhow
i
ca
stop
it
but
i
jolly
well
not
going
to
with
it
i
clearing
out
giving
up
the
fight
then
caving
in
putting
your
hands
up
to
potterism
she
was
taunting
him
in
her
cool
unmoved
leisurely
tones
clearing
out
he
repeated
emphasising
the
phrase
and
his
black
eyes
seemed
to
look
into
distances
away
if
you
like
this
thing
too
strong
for
me
to
fight
i
ca
do
it
clare
quite
right
it
tremendous
it
will
last
and
the
pinkerton
press
only
represents
one
tiny
part
of
it
if
the
pinkerton
press
were
all
it
would
be
fightable
but
look
at
the
a
sworn
enemy
of
everything
the
pinkerton
press
stands
for
politically
but
fighting
it
with
its
own
weapons
muddled
thinking
sentimentality
prejudice
loose
cant
phrases
i
tell
you
there
hardly
be
a
halfpenny
to
choose
between
the
pinkerton
press
and
the
by
the
time
peacock
done
with
it
it
not
peacock
fault
except
that
he
weak
it
not
the
fault
except
that
they
do
want
to
go
on
losing
money
for
ever
the
pressure
of
public
demand
and
atmosphere
atmosphere
even
more
than
demand
human
minds
are
delicate
machines
how
can
they
go
on
working
truly
and
precisely
and
scientifically
with
all
this
poisonous
gas
floating
round
them
oh
well
i
suppose
there
are
a
few
minds
still
which
do
even
some
journalists
and
politicians
keep
their
heads
but
what
the
use
against
the
pressure
to
go
in
for
journalism
or
for
public
life
is
to
put
oneself
deliberately
into
the
thick
of
the
mess
without
being
able
to
clean
it
up
all
said
jane
more
moderately
all
a
joke
everything
is
the
world
is
rotten
bad
joke
think
things
matter
you
take
seriously
as
some
people
take
potterism
are
serious
things
do
matter
said
the
russian
jew
jane
looked
at
him
kindly
she
was
a
year
younger
than
he
was
but
felt
five
years
older
what
the
remedy
then
he
said
wearily
education
i
suppose
education
there
nothing
else
he
said
the
word
with
affection
lingering
on
it
striking
his
hand
on
the
to
emphasise
it
learning
learning
there
nothing
else
we
should
drop
all
this
talking
and
writing
all
this
confused
uneducated
mass
of
with
no
self
worth
expressing
just
what
we
should
do
with
our
selves
express
them
we
should
train
them
educate
them
teach
them
to
think
see
that
they
something
know
it
exactly
with
no
blurred
edges
no
fogs
be
sure
of
our
facts
and
keep
theories
out
of
the
system
like
poison
and
when
we
say
anything
we
should
say
it
concisely
and
baldly
without
eloquence
and
frills
lord
how
i
loathe
eloquence
you
ca
get
away
from
it
darling
all
right
do
mind
me
i
like
it
well
now
what
are
you
going
to
about
it
teach
in
a
continuation
school
he
said
seriously
though
one
might
do
worse
but
i
got
to
get
right
away
for
a
time
right
out
of
it
all
i
got
to
find
things
out
before
i
do
anything
else
there
are
plenty
of
things
to
find
out
here
no
need
to
go
away
for
that
he
shook
his
head
europe
so
hopeless
just
now
so
given
over
to
muddle
and
lies
besides
i
ca
trust
myself
i
shall
talk
if
i
stay
i
not
a
strong
silent
man
i
should
find
myself
writing
articles
or
standing
for
parliament
or
something
very
nice
too
i
always
said
you
ought
to
stand
for
labour
i
sometimes
agreed
with
you
but
now
i
know
i
ought
not
the
way
i
not
going
to
join
in
that
mess
i
not
good
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
i
should
either
get
swamped
by
it
or
i
should
get
so
angry
that
i
should
murder
some
one
no
i
going
right
out
of
it
all
for
a
bit
i
want
to
find
out
a
little
if
i
can
about
how
things
are
in
other
countries
central
europe
russia
i
shall
go
to
russia
you
come
back
and
write
about
it
people
do
shall
not
no
i
think
i
can
avoid
that
it
too
obvious
a
temptation
to
tumble
into
with
one
eyes
shut
he
travelled
in
russia
and
never
wrote
of
it
it
would
be
a
good
epitaph
but
arthur
darling
is
it
wise
is
it
necessary
is
it
safe
wo
the
reds
get
you
or
the
whites
which
would
be
worse
i
wonder
should
they
want
with
me
think
you
going
to
write
about
them
of
course
that
why
the
reds
kidnapped
keeling
and
the
whites
goode
they
were
quite
right
too
except
that
they
did
go
far
enough
and
make
a
job
of
them
suppose
they
learnt
wisdom
by
now
and
make
a
job
of
you
then
i
shall
be
made
a
job
of
also
a
placard
for
our
sensational
press
which
would
be
worse
one
must
take
a
few
risks
it
will
be
interesting
you
know
to
be
there
i
shall
visit
my
father
old
home
near
odessa
possibly
some
of
his
people
may
be
left
round
there
i
shall
find
things
out
what
the
conditions
are
why
things
are
happening
as
they
are
how
the
people
live
i
think
i
shall
be
better
able
after
that
to
find
out
what
the
state
of
things
is
here
one
too
provincial
too
much
taken
up
with
one
own
corner
political
science
is
too
universal
a
thing
to
learn
in
that
way
when
you
found
out
what
next
no
next
it
will
take
me
all
my
life
even
to
begin
to
find
out
i
do
know
where
i
shall
be
in
london
no
doubt
mostly
you
mean
arthur
that
you
going
to
chuck
work
for
good
writing
i
mean
or
public
work
hope
so
i
mean
to
oh
if
ever
later
on
i
feel
i
have
anything
i
want
to
say
i
say
it
but
that
wo
be
for
years
first
i
going
to
learn
you
see
jane
we
can
live
all
right
thank
goodness
i
depend
on
what
i
earn
you
and
i
together
we
learn
a
lot
i
going
in
for
confused
i
not
taking
any
vows
of
silence
i
going
to
write
you
like
every
one
got
to
decide
for
themselves
it
amuses
you
i
suppose
course
it
does
why
not
i
love
it
not
only
writing
but
being
in
the
swim
making
a
kind
of
a

every

every

directly
he
thinks
of
his

as
something

something
to
bring

there

of
his

every

you

everywhere
the

you
ca
get
away
from
it
except
by
keeping
quiet
and
learning
and
wanting
truth
more
than
anything
else
sounds
a
dull
life
arthur
rather
like
k
in
her
old
laboratory
rather
like
k
not
dull
no
finding
things
out
ca
be
dull
old
thing
go
and
find
things
out
but
come
back
in
time
for
the
wedding
and
then
we
see
what
next
jane
was
not
seriously
alarmed
she
believed
that
this
of
arthur
was
a
short
attack
when
they
were
married
she
would
see
that
he
got
cured
of
it
she
was
going
to
let
him
drop
out
of
things
and
disappear
her
brilliant
arthur
who
had
his
world
in
his
hand
to
play
with
journalism
politics
public
life
of
some
sort
it
was
these
that
he
was
so
eminently
fitted
for
and
must
go
in
for
must
waste
yourself
arthur
she
said
all
right
to
lie
low
for
a
bit
but
when
you
come
back
you
must
do
something
worth
while
i
sorry
about
the
i
think
you
might
have
stayed
on
and
saved
it
but
it
your
show
go
and
explore
central
europe
then
and
learn
all
about
it
then
come
back
and
write
a
book
on
political
science
which
will
be
repulsive
to
all
but
learned
minds
but
remember
we
getting
married
in
june
do
be
late
will
you
and
write
to
me
from
russia
letters
that
will
do
for
me
to
send
to
the
newspapers
telling
me
not
to
spend
my
money
on
hats
and
theatres
but
on
distributing
and
tracts
i
have
the
letters
published
in
leaflets
at
threepence
a
hundred
and
drop
them
about
in
public
places
write
to
you
no
fear
said
gideon
i
be
in
time
for
the
wedding
jane
we
have
a
great
time
you
and
i
learning
things
together
we
have
adventures
we
go
exploring
shall
we
we
lend
charles
to
mother
and
dad
often
and
go
off
come
with
you
now
for
two
pins
only
i
ca
charles
needs
you
at
present
my
book
too
and
all
sorts
of
things
your
book
that
nothing
books
are
worth
losing
anything
for
do
you
ever
get
tied
up
with
books
and
work
jane
not
worth
it
one
got
to
sit
loose
only
one
ca
to
kids
too
important
we
have
our
good
times
before
we
get
our
kids
and
after
they
grown
old
enough
to
be
left
to
themselves
a
bit
jane
smiled
enigmatically
only
obscurely
realising
that
she
meant
ideas
of
a
good
time
are
the
same
and
never
will
be
gideon
too
only
obscurely
knew
it
anyhow
for
both
the
contemplation
of
that
difference
could
be
deferred
each
could
hope
to
break
the
other
in
when
the
time
came
gideon
as
befitted
his
sex
realised
the
eternity
of
the
difference
less
sharply
than
jane
did
it
was
just
he
thought
a
question
of
showing
jane
making
her
understand
jane
did
not
think
that
it
was
just
a
question
of
making
gideon
understand
but
he
loved
her
and
she
was
persuaded
that
he
would
yield
to
her
in
the
end
and
not
spoil
her
jolly
delightful
life
which
was
to
advance
hand
in
hand
with
his
to
notoriety
or
glory
or
both
for
a
moment
both
heard
remotely
the
faint
clash
of
swords
then
they
shut
a
door
upon
the
sound
and
the
man
shaken
with
sudden
passion
drew
the
woman
into
his
arms
been
talking
talking
all
the
evening
said
gideon
presently
ca
get
away
from
it
can
preaching
theorising
holding
forth
more
than
time
i
went
away
somewhere
where
no
one
will
listen
to
me
plenty
of
talking
in
russia
you
come
back
worse
than
ever
my
dear
i
do
care
as
long
as
you
do
come
back
you
must
come
back
to
me
arthur
she
clung
to
him
in
one
of
her
rare
moments
of
demonstrated
passion
she
was
usually
cool
and
left
demonstration
to
him
shall
come
back
all
right
he
told
her
fear
i
want
to
get
married
you
see
i
want
it
really
much
more
than
i
want
to
get
information
or
anything
else
wanting
a
person
that
what
we
all
want
most
when
we
want
it
at
all
queer
is
it
and
hopelessly
personal
and
selfish
but
there
it
is
ideals
simply
do
count
in
comparison
they
go
under
every
time
if
there
was
a
choice
jane
with
his
arms
round
her
and
his
face
bent
down
to
hers
knew
it
she
was
not
afraid
either
for
his
career
or
her
own
they
would
have
their
good
time
all
right
chapter
v
a
placard
for
the
press
march
wore
through
and
april
came
and
warm
winds
healed
winter
scars
and
the
budget
shocked
every
one
and
the
industrial
revolution
predicted
as
usual
did
come
off
and
wells
of
the
completed
its
tenth
part
and
blossom
by
blossom
the
spring
began
it
was
the
second
easter
after
the
war
and
people
were
getting
more
used
to
peace
they
murdered
one
another
rather
less
frequently
were
rather
less
emotional
and
divorced
and
understood
with
more
precision
which
profiteers
it
was
worth
while
to
prosecute
and
which
not
and
why
the
second
class
was
so
much
larger
than
the
first
and
in
general
had
learnt
to
manage
rather
better
this
unmanageable
peace
the
outlook
domestic
and
international
was
still
what
those
who
think
in
terms
of
colour
call
black
the
irish
question
the
russian
question
the
question
and
all
the
asiatic
questions
remained
what
those
who
think
in
terms
of
angles
call
acute
economic
ruin
political
bankruptcy
european
chaos
international
hostilities
had
become
accepted
as
the
normal
state
of
being
by
the
inhabitants
of
this
restless
and
unfortunate
planet
such
was
the
state
of
things
in
the
world
at
large
in
literary
london
publishers
produced
their
spring
lists
they
contained
the
usual
hardy
annuals
and
among
novelists
several
new
ventures
including
john
potter
in
second
impression
jane
of
a
satire
by
a
new
writer
and
leila
yorke
price
of
her
new
novel
leila
yorke
reveals
to
the
full
the
glittering
psychology
combined
with
profound
depths
which
have
made
this
writer
famous
the
tale
will
be
read
from
first
page
to
last
with
breathless
interest
the
end
is
unexpected
and
out
of
the
common
and
leaves
one
wondering
so
said
the
publisher
the
reviewers
more
briefly
leila
yorke
there
were
also
many
memoirs
of
great
persons
by
themselves
many
histories
of
the
recent
war
several
thousand
books
of
verse
a
monograph
by
varick
on
catalysers
and
catalysis
and
the
generation
of
hydrogen
and
by
the
reverend
laurence
juke
the
journalistic
world
also
flourished
the
had
become
as
people
said
quite
an
interesting
and
readable
paper
brighter
than
the
more
emotional
than
the
gentler
than
the
spicier
than
the
more
chatty
than
the
so
that
one
bought
it
on
bookstalls
and
read
it
in
trains
there
was
also
the
new
pinkerton
fourpenny
the
brighter
more
emotional
gentler
spicier
and
chattier
than
them
all
and
vulgar
as
well
nearly
as
vulgar
as
and
quite
as
sentimental
but
less
vicious
so
that
it
sold
in
its
millions
from
the
outset
and
soon
had
a
poem
up
on
the
walls
of
the
tube
stations
saying
other
weeklies
sell
anything
like
so
well
which
was
as
near
the
truth
as
these
statements
usually
are
lord
pinkerton
had
in
fact
with
his
usual
acumen
sensed
the
existence
of
a
great
fourpenny
weekly
public
and
given
it
as
was
his
wont
more
than
it
desired
or
deserved
the
sixpenny
weekly
public
already
had
its
needs
met
so
had
the
penny
the
twopenny
the
threepenny
and
the
shilling
public
now
the
fourpenny
public
a
shy
and
modest
section
of
the
community
largely
clerical
in
the
lay
sense
of
the
word
looked
up
and
was
fed
those
brains
which
could
only
with
effort
rise
to
the
solid
political
and
economic
information
and
cultured
literary
judgments
meted
out
by
the
sixpennies
but
which
yet
shrank
from
the
crudities
of
our
cheapest
journals
here
found
something
they
could
read
mark
learn
and
inwardly
digest
the
potterite
press
not
only
lord
pinkerton
advanced
like
an
army
terrible
with
banners
on
all
sections
of
the
line
juke
book
on
modern
thought
in
the
church
was
a
success
it
was
brilliantly
written
and
reviewed
in
lay
as
well
as
in
church
papers
juke
to
his
own
detriment
became
popular
canon
streeter
and
others
asked
him
to
collaborate
in
joint
books
on
the
church
modernist
vicars
asked
him
to
preach
when
he
preached
people
came
in
hundreds
to
hear
him
because
he
was
an
attractive
stimulating
and
entertaining
preacher
i
have
never
had
this
experience
but
i
assume
that
it
is
morally
unwholesome
he
had
to
take
missions
and
retreats
and
quiet
days
and
give
lectures
on
the
church
to
cultivated
audiences
then
he
was
offered
the
living
of
anne
piccadilly
which
is
one
of
those
incumbencies
with
what
is
known
as
scope
which
meant
that
there
were
no
poor
in
the
parish
and
the
incumbent
gifts
as
preacher
lecturer
writer
and
social
success
could
be
used
to
the
best
advantage
he
was
given
three
weeks
to
decide
gideon
wrote
long
letters
to
jane
from
the
russian
towns
and
villages
in
which
he
sojourned
but
none
of
them
were
suitable
for
propaganda
purposes
they
were
critical
but
dispassionate
he
had
found
some
cousins
of
his
father
fur
merchants
living
in
a
small
town
on
the
edge
of
a
forest
cringing
people
he
said
the
older
generation
remembered
his
grandparents
and
his
father
as
a
infant
they
remembered
that
pogrom
fifty
years
ago
and
described
it
describe
anything
wrote
gideon
more
horrible
it
is
the
more
they
talk
that
russian
not
jewish
specially
or
is
it
just
human
gideon
did
repeat
to
jane
the
details
he
heard
of
his
grandparents
murder
by
russian
police
details
which
his
father
in
whose
memory
they
burned
like
a
disease
had
never
told
him
as
bad
as
that
massacre
are
happening
all
the
time
in
this
pleasant
country
he
wrote
does
matter
what
the
political
convictions
if
any
of
a
russian
are
he
a
barbarian
whether
he
on
a
soviet
or
in
the
armies
not
always
of
course
there
are
a
few
who
have
escaped
the
prevalent
lust
of
cruelty
but
only
a
few
love
of
pain
as
experienced
by
others
for
its
own
sake
as
one
loves
good
food
or
beautiful
women
it
a
queer
disease
it
goes
along
often
with
other
strong
sensual
desires
the
russians
for
instance
are
the
worst
gluttons
and
profligates
of
europe
with
it
all
they
have
often
an
extraordinary
generous
with
one
hand
they
will
give
away
what
they
ca
spare
to
some
one
in
need
while
with
the
other
they
torture
an
animal
or
a
human
being
to
death
the
women
seldomer
do
either
like
women
everywhere
they
are
less
given
both
to
sensual
desire
and
to
generous
a
curious
thing
how
seldom
you
find
physical
cruelty
in
a
woman
of
any
nationality
even
the
most
spiteful
and
morally
unkindest
little
girl
will
shudder
away
while
her
brother
tears
the
wings
off
a
fly
or
the
legs
off
a
frog
or
impales
a
worm
on
a
hook
weak
nerves
partly
and
partly
the
sort
of
fastidiousness
women
have
when
you
come
across
cruelty
in
a
woman
physical
cruelty
of
course
you
think
of
her
as
a
monster
just
as
when
you
come
on
a
stingy
man
you
think
of
him
but
probably
inaccurately
as
a
jew
russians
are
very
male
except
in
their
inchoate
confused
thinking
their
special
brand
of
humour
and
of
sentimentality
are
male
their
exuberant
strength
and
aliveness
their
sensuality
and
their
savage
cruelty
if
ever
women
come
to
count
in
russia
as
a
force
not
merely
as
mates
for
the
men
queer
things
will
happen
here
in
this
town
things
are
for
the
moment
tidy
and
ordered
as
if
seven
germans
with
seven
mops
had
swept
it
for
half
a
year
the
local
soviet
is
a
gang
of
ruffians
but
they
do
keep
things
more
or
less
and
they
make
people
work
and
they
torture
dogs
later
he
wrote
were
right
as
to
one
thing
every
one
i
meet
including
my
relations
is
persuaded
that
i
am
either
a
newspaper
correspondent
or
writing
a
book
or
more
probably
both
these
taints
cling
so
i
feel
like
a
reformed
drunkard
who
has
taken
the
pledge
but
still
carries
about
with
him
a
red
nose
and
shaky
hands
so
that
he
gets
no
credit
for
his
new
sobriety
what
the
good
of
my
telling
people
here
that
i
do
write
when
i
suppose
i
the
mark
of
the
beast
stamped
all
over
me
and
they
play
up
they
talk
for
me
to
record
it
find
all
kinds
of
odd
things
here
among
others
an
english
doctor
in
the
local
lunatic
asylum
mad
as
a
hatter
poor
devil
now
whatever
he
was
when
they
shut
him
up
i
dare
say
he
been
through
enough
even
then
to
turn
his
brain
i
ca
find
out
who
his
friends
in
england
are
gideon
stopped
writing
and
took
jane
last
letter
out
of
his
pocket
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
in
no
sense
answering
it
not
that
jane
would
mind
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
she
did
mind
but
it
struck
him
suddenly
how
difficult
it
had
grown
to
him
to
answer
jane
letters
or
indeed
any
one
else
he
could
not
flatter
himself
that
he
was
already
contracting
the
inarticulate
habit
because
he
could
pour
forth
fluently
enough
about
his
own
experiences
but
to
jane
news
of
london
he
had
nothing
to
say
a
new
paper
had
been
started
another
paper
had
died
some
one
they
knew
had
deserted
from
one
literary
côterie
to
another
some
one
else
had
turned
from
a
dowdy
into
a
nut
jane
had
been
seeing
a
lot
of
bad
plays
her
novel
confused
mass
of
she
called
it
to
him
was
coming
out
next
week
all
the
familiar
personal
literary
political
and
social
gossip
which
he
too
had
dealt
in
once
jane
was
in
the
thick
of
it
still
and
he
was
turning
stupid
like
a
man
living
in
the
country
he
could
not
answer
her
or
perhaps
would
not
because
the
thing
that
absorbed
him
at
present
was
how
people
lived
and
thought
and
what
could
be
made
of
them
not
the
conscious
intellectual
writing
discussing
people
what
an
absurd
word
what
is
complete
civilisation
that
we
should
bisect
it
and
say
we
have
half
or
any
other
exact
fraction
partly
civilised
gideon
amended
it
to
but
the
great
unconscious
masses
hardly
civilised
at
all
who
shape
things
for
good
or
evil
in
the
long
run
gideon
folded
up
jane
letter
and
put
it
away
and
to
his
own
added
nothing
but
his
love
jane
got
that
letter
in
easter
week
it
was
a
fine
warm
day
and
she
walking
across
green
park
met
juke
who
had
been
lunching
with
a
bishop
to
meet
an
elderly
princess
who
had
read
his
book
said
i
afraid
you
sadly
satirical
juke
he
told
jane
did
really
and
i
to
preach
at
sandringham
one
sunday
yes
to
the
family
tell
gideon
that
will
you
he
be
so
disgusted
but
what
a
chance
life
at
anne
is
going
to
be
full
of
chances
of
slanging
the
rich
that
one
thing
about
it
you
going
to
take
it
then
i
not
written
to
accept
yet
so
do
pass
it
on
glad
it
much
more
amusing
to
accept
things
even
livings
be
lovely
you
be
all
among
the
clubs
and
theatres
and
the
idle
rich
much
gayer
than
covent
garden
gayer
said
juke
they
came
out
into
birdcage
walk
and
there
was
a
man
selling
the
lord
pinkerton
evening
paper
massacres
he
was
observing
with
a
kind
of
happiness
massacres
in
russia
ireland
armenia
and
the
punjab
british
journalist
assassinated
near
odessa
and
there
it
was
too
in
big
black
letters
on
the
placard
of
a
peeress
of
british
journalist
in
wire
from
gatwick
they
bought
the
paper
to
see
who
the
british
journalist
was
his
murder
was
in
a
little
paragraph
on
the
front
page
arthur
gideon
a
british
journalist
first
beaten
nearly
to
death
by
white
soldiery
because
he
was
entirely
in
vain
defending
some
poor
jewish
family
from
their
wrath
then
found
by
bolshevists
and
disposed
of
somehow
because
he
was
an
englishman
a
placard
for
the
press
a
placard
for
the
potter
press
had
he
thought
of
that
at
the
last
and
died
in
the
bitterness
of
that
paradox
murdered
by
both
sides
being
of
neither
but
merely
a
seeker
after
fact
killed
in
the
quest
for
truth
and
the
war
against
verbiage
and
cant
and
in
the
end
a
placard
for
the
press
which
hated
the
one
and
lived
by
the
other
he
thought
of
that
as
he
broke
under
the
last
strain
of
pain
or
merely
damned
brutes
white
or
red
there
nothing
to
choose
nothing
to
choose
anyhow
it
was
over
that
quest
of
his
and
nothing
remained
but
the
placard
which
coupled
his
defeat
with
the
peeress
divorce
arthur
gideon
had
gone
under
but
the
potter
press
the
flaunting
banner
of
the
great
sentimental
public
remained
it
would
always
remain
so
long
as
the
great
sentimental
public
were
what
they
were
little
remains
to
add
little
of
gideon
for
they
never
learnt
much
more
of
his
death
than
was
telegraphed
in
that
first
message
his
father
going
out
to
the
scene
of
his
death
may
have
heard
more
if
he
did
he
never
revealed
it
to
any
one
not
only
arthur
had
perished
but
the
jewish
family
he
was
trying
to
defend
he
had
failed
as
well
as
died
failed
utterly
every
way
gone
under
and
finished
he
and
his
pedantry
and
his
exactitude
his
preaching
his
hard
clarity
and
his
bewildered
bitterness
against
a
world
vulgar
and
beyond
his
understanding
juke
refused
anne
with
its
chances
its
congregations
and
its
scope
neither
did
he
preach
at
sandringham
gideon
fate
pilloried
on
that
placard
had
stabbed
through
him
and
cut
him
sick
and
angry
from
his
moorings
he
spoke
no
more
and
wrote
no
more
to
admiring
audiences
who
hung
on
his
words
and
took
his
quick
points
as
he
made
them
to
be
one
with
other
men
he
learnt
a
manual
trade
and
made
shoes
in
bermondsey
and
preached
in
the
streets
to
men
who
did
not
as
a
rule
listen
jane
would
no
doubt
fulfil
herself
in
the
course
of
time
make
an
adequate
figure
in
the
world
she
loved
and
suck
therefrom
no
small
advantage
she
had
loved
arthur
gideon
but
what
lady
pinkerton
and
clare
would
call
her
was
not
of
the
kind
which
would
as
these
two
would
doubtless
put
it
in
their
strange
phraseology
somehow
after
all
jane
would
have
her
good
time
if
not
in
one
way
then
in
another
lord
and
lady
pinkerton
flourish
exceedingly
and
will
be
long
in
the
land
leila
yorke
sells
better
than
ever
of
the
pinkerton
press
i
need
not
speak
since
it
is
so
well
qualified
to
speak
for
itself
enough
to
say
that
no
fears
are
at
present
entertained
for
its
demise
and
little
charles
hobart
grows
in
stature
under
his
grandfather
watching
and
approving
eye
when
the
time
comes
he
will
carry
on
worthily
