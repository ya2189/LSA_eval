meddles
dinner
was
over
and
cartwright
occupied
a
chair
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
canadian
summer
hotel
automatic
sprinklers
threw
sparkling
showers
across
the
rough
parched
grass
the
lake
shimmered
smooth
as
oil
in
the
sunset
and
a
sweet
resinous
smell
drifted
from
the
pines
that
rolled
down
to
the
water
edge
the
straight
trunks
stood
out
against
a
background
of
luminous
red
and
green
and
here
and
there
a
slanting
beam
touched
a
branch
with
fire
natural
beauty
had
not
much
charm
for
cartwright
who
was
satisfied
to
loaf
and
enjoy
the
cool
of
the
evening
he
had
as
usual
dined
well
his
cigar
was
good
and
he
meant
to
give
cartwright
half
an
hour
clara
expected
this
and
although
he
was
sometimes
bored
he
indulged
her
when
he
could
besides
it
was
too
soon
for
cards
the
lights
had
not
begun
to
spring
up
in
the
wooden
hotel
and
for
the
most
part
the
guests
were
boating
on
the
lake
when
he
had
finished
his
cigar
it
would
be
time
to
join
the
party
in
the
cartwright
was
something
of
a
gambler
and
liked
the
american
games
they
gave
one
scope
for
bluffing
and
although
his
antagonists
declared
his
luck
was
good
he
knew
his
nerve
was
better
in
fact
since
he
lost
his
money
by
a
reckless
plunge
he
had
to
some
extent
lived
by
bluff
yet
some
people
trusted
tom
cartwright
cartwright
did
so
she
was
a
large
dull
woman
but
had
kept
a
touch
of
the
beauty
that
had
marked
her
when
she
was
young
she
was
kind
conventional
and
generally
anxious
to
take
the
proper
line
cartwright
was
twelve
years
older
and
since
she
was
a
widow
and
had
three
children
when
she
married
him
her
friends
declared
her
money
accounted
for
much
and
a
lawyer
relation
carefully
guarded
against
cartwright
using
her
fortune
yet
in
a
sense
cartwright
was
not
an
adventurer
although
his
ventures
in
finance
and
shipping
were
numerous
he
sprang
from
an
old
liverpool
family
whose
prosperity
diminished
when
steamers
replaced
sailing
ships
his
father
had
waited
long
before
he
resigned
himself
to
the
change
but
was
not
altogether
too
late
and
cartwright
was
now
managing
owner
of
the
independent
freighters
line
the
company
business
had
brought
him
to
montreal
and
when
it
was
transacted
he
had
taken
cartwright
and
her
family
to
the
hotel
by
the
ontario
lake
cartwright
hair
and
mustache
were
white
his
face
was
fleshy
and
red
he
was
fastidious
about
his
clothes
and
his
tailor
cleverly
hid
the
bulkiness
of
his
figure
as
a
rule
his
look
was
fierce
and
commanding
but
now
and
then
his
small
keen
eyes
twinkled
although
cartwright
was
clever
he
was
in
some
respects
primitive
he
had
long
indulged
his
appetites
and
wore
the
stamp
of
what
is
sometimes
called
good
living
the
managing
owner
of
the
independent
freighters
needed
cleverness
since
the
company
was
small
and
often
embarrassed
for
money
for
the
most
part
it
ran
its
ships
in
opposition
to
the
regular
liners
when
the
forced
up
freights
cartwright
quietly
canvassed
the
merchants
and
offered
to
carry
their
goods
at
something
under
the
standard
rate
if
the
shippers
would
engage
to
fill
up
his
boat
as
a
rule
secrecy
was
important
but
sometimes
when
cargo
was
scarce
cartwright
let
his
plans
be
known
and
allowed
the
to
buy
him
off
although
his
skill
in
the
delicate
negotiations
was
marked
the
company
paid
small
dividends
and
he
had
enemies
among
the
shareholders
now
however
he
was
satisfied
had
sailed
for
montreal
loaded
to
the
limit
the
law
allowed
and
he
had
booked
her
return
cargo
before
the
knew
he
was
cutting
rates
cartwright
talked
but
she
talked
much
and
cartwright
hardly
listened
and
looked
across
the
lake
a
canoe
drifted
out
from
behind
a
neighboring
point
and
its
varnished
side
shone
in
the
fading
light
then
a
man
dipped
the
paddle
and
the
ripple
at
the
bow
got
longer
and
broke
the
reflections
of
the
pines
a
girl
sitting
at
the
stern
put
her
hands
in
the
water
and
when
she
flung
the
sparkling
drops
at
her
companion
her
laugh
came
across
the
lake
cartwright
look
got
keen
and
he
began
to
note
his
wife
remarks
do
you
imply
barbara
getting
fond
of
the
fellow
he
asked
i
am
afraid
of
something
like
that
cartwright
admitted
in
a
way
one
hesitates
to
meddle
sometimes
meddling
does
harm
and
of
course
if
barbara
really
loved
the
young
man
she
paused
and
gave
cartwright
a
sentimental
smile
after
all
i
married
for
love
and
a
number
of
my
friends
did
not
approve
cartwright
grunted
he
had
married
clara
because
she
was
rich
but
it
was
something
to
his
credit
that
she
had
not
suspected
this
clara
was
dull
and
her
dullness
often
amused
him
if
you
think
it
necessary
i
wo
hesitate
about
meddling
he
remarked
shillito
a
beggarly
sawmill
clerk
he
said
he
was
for
an
important
lumber
company
very
young
and
romantic
and
although
she
has
not
known
him
long
she
has
known
him
for
about
two
weeks
cartwright
rejoined
perhaps
it
long
enough
shillito
what
canadians
call
a
looker
and
a
romantic
fool
i
no
doubt
he
found
out
she
inherit
some
money
it
possible
she
told
him
now
i
come
to
think
about
it
she
was
off
somewhere
all
the
afternoon
and
it
looks
as
if
she
had
promised
the
fellow
the
evening
he
indicated
the
canoe
and
was
satisfied
when
cartwright
agreed
since
he
refused
to
wear
spectacles
and
own
his
sight
was
going
although
clara
was
generous
he
could
not
use
her
money
and
indeed
did
not
mean
to
do
so
but
he
was
extravagant
and
his
managing
post
was
not
secure
when
one
had
powerful
antagonists
one
did
not
admit
that
one
was
getting
old
i
doubt
if
shillito
character
is
all
one
could
wish
cartwright
resumed
character
very
important
do
you
think
grant
the
woman
with
the
big
hat
knows
something
about
him
and
she
said
he
was
i
think
she
meant
he
was
wild
then
she
hinted
he
spent
money
he
ought
not
to
spend
but
is
a
treasurer
pay
good
cartwright
smiled
for
he
was
patient
to
his
wife
it
depends
upon
the
company
a
treasurer
is
sometimes
a
clerk
however
the
trouble
is
barbara
as
wild
as
a
hawk
though
i
do
know
where
she
got
her
wildness
her
brother
and
sister
are
tame
enough
sometimes
i
bothered
about
barbara
cartwright
agreed
rash
and
obstinate
not
like
the
others
i
do
know
if
they
tame
but
they
had
never
given
me
much
anxiety
one
can
trust
them
to
do
all
they
ought
cartwright
said
nothing
as
a
rule
clara
son
and
elder
daughter
annoyed
him
mortimer
hyslop
was
a
calculating
prig
grace
was
finicking
and
bound
by
ridiculous
rules
she
was
pale
and
inanimate
there
was
no
blood
in
her
but
cartwright
was
fond
of
the
younger
girl
barbara
was
frankly
flesh
and
blood
he
liked
her
flashes
of
temper
and
her
pluck
when
the
canoe
came
to
the
landing
he
got
up
leave
the
thing
to
me
he
said
i
talk
to
shillito
he
went
off
but
when
he
reached
the
steps
to
the
veranda
in
front
of
the
hotel
he
stopped
his
gout
bothered
him
at
the
top
mortimer
hyslop
was
smoking
a
cigarette
the
young
man
was
thin
and
looked
bored
his
summer
clothes
were
a
study
in
harmonious
colors
and
he
had
delicate
hands
like
a
woman
when
he
saw
cartwright
stop
he
asked
can
i
help
you
up
sir
cartwright
face
got
red
he
hated
an
offer
of
help
that
drew
attention
to
his
infirmity
and
thought
mortimer
knew
no
thanks
i
not
a
cripple
yet
have
you
seen
shillito
you
probably
find
him
in
the
smoking
room
the
card
party
has
gone
in
and
he
a
gambler
so
am
i
mortimer
shrugged
and
cartwright
wondered
whether
the
fellow
meant
to
imply
that
his
gambling
was
not
important
since
he
had
married
a
rich
wife
the
young
man
however
hesitated
and
looked
thoughtful
i
do
know
your
object
for
wanting
shillito
but
if
my
near
the
mark
might
i
state
that
i
approve
in
fact
i
begun
to
wonder
whether
something
ought
not
to
be
done
the
fellow
plausible
not
our
sort
of
course
but
when
a
girl
romantic
and
obstinate
cartwright
stopped
him
exactly
well
i
the
head
of
the
house
and
imagine
you
can
leave
the
thing
to
me
perhaps
it
does
matter
if
your
sister
is
obstinate
i
going
to
talk
to
shillito
he
crossed
the
veranda
and
mortimer
returned
to
his
chair
and
cigarette
he
did
not
approve
his
but
admitted
that
cartwright
could
be
trusted
to
handle
a
matter
like
this
fastidiousness
was
sometimes
a
handicap
but
cartwright
had
none
cartwright
entered
the
and
crossed
the
floor
to
a
table
at
which
two
or
three
men
stood
as
if
waiting
for
somebody
one
was
young
and
tall
his
thin
face
was
finely
molded
his
eyes
and
hair
were
very
black
and
his
figure
was
marked
by
an
agile
grace
he
looked
up
sharply
as
cartwright
advanced
i
want
you
for
a
few
minutes
cartwright
said
roughly
as
if
he
gave
an
order
shillito
frowned
but
went
with
him
to
the
back
veranda
although
the
night
was
warm
and
an
electric
light
burned
under
the
roof
nobody
was
about
cartwright
signed
the
other
to
sit
down
i
expect
your
holiday
nearly
up
and
the
hotel
car
meets
the
train
in
the
morning
he
remarked
what
about
it
shillito
asked
i
not
going
yet
you
going
said
cartwright
grimly
shillito
smiled
and
gave
him
an
insolent
look
but
his
smile
vanished
cartwright
white
mustache
bristled
his
face
was
red
and
his
eyes
were
very
steady
it
was
not
for
nothing
the
old
had
fronted
disappointed
investors
and
forced
his
will
on
shareholders
meetings
shillito
saw
the
fellow
was
dangerous
i
call
you
he
said
using
a
gambler
phrase
very
well
said
cartwright
i
think
my
cards
are
good
and
if
i
win
on
one
suit
i
try
another
to
begin
with
the
hotel
proprietor
sent
for
me
he
stated
the
house
was
new
and
beginning
to
pay
and
he
was
anxious
about
its
character
people
must
be
amused
but
he
was
running
a
summer
hotel
not
a
gambling
den
the
play
was
too
high
and
young
fools
got
into
trouble
two
or
three
days
since
one
got
broke
well
he
wanted
me
to
use
my
influence
and
i
said
i
would
he
asked
you
to
keep
the
stakes
in
bounds
it
a
good
joke
not
at
all
said
cartwright
dryly
i
like
an
exciting
game
so
long
as
it
is
straight
and
when
i
lose
i
pay
i
do
lose
and
if
i
come
out
fifty
dollars
ahead
when
i
leave
i
be
satisfied
how
much
have
you
cleared
shillito
said
nothing
and
cartwright
went
on
my
antagonists
are
old
who
know
the
game
but
when
you
broke
forman
he
was
drunk
and
the
other
two
were
not
quite
sober
you
play
against
young
fools
and
luck
too
if
you
force
me
to
tell
all
i
think
and
something
that
i
know
i
imagine
you
get
a
straight
hint
to
quit
you
talked
about
another
plan
shillito
remarked
on
the
whole
i
think
the
plan
i
indicated
will
work
if
it
does
not
and
you
speak
to
any
member
of
cartwright
family
i
thrash
you
on
the
veranda
when
people
are
about
i
wo
state
my
grounds
for
doing
so
they
ought
to
be
obvious
shillito
looked
at
the
other
hand
cartwright
eyes
were
bloodshot
his
face
was
going
purple
and
he
thrust
out
his
heavy
chin
shillito
thought
he
meant
all
he
said
and
his
threat
carried
weight
the
old
fellow
was
of
course
not
a
match
for
the
vigorous
young
man
but
shillito
saw
he
had
the
power
to
do
him
an
injury
that
was
not
altogether
physical
he
pondered
for
a
few
moments
and
then
got
up
i
pull
out
he
said
with
a
coolness
that
cost
him
much
cartwright
nodded
there
another
thing
if
you
write
to
miss
hyslop
your
letters
will
be
burned
he
went
back
to
the
and
playing
with
his
usual
boldness
won
twenty
dollars
then
he
joined
cartwright
on
the
front
veranda
and
remarked
shillito
wo
bother
us
he
goes
in
the
morning
cartwright
gave
him
a
grateful
smile
she
had
long
known
that
when
she
asked
her
husband
help
difficulties
were
removed
now
he
had
removed
shillito
and
she
was
satisfied
but
imagined
he
was
not
cartwright
knitted
his
white
brows
and
drew
hard
at
his
cigar
you
had
better
watch
barbara
until
the
fellow
starts
he
resumed
then
i
think
you
and
the
girls
might
join
the
vernons
at
their
fishing
camp
vernon
would
like
it
and
he
a
useful
friend
besides
possible
shillito
obstinate
your
letters
need
follow
you
have
them
sent
to
me
at
montreal
which
will
cover
your
tracks
i
must
go
back
in
a
few
days
cartwright
weighed
the
suggestion
vernon
was
a
winnipeg
merchant
and
his
wife
had
urged
her
to
join
the
party
at
the
fishing
camp
in
the
woods
the
journey
was
long
but
cartwright
rather
liked
the
plan
shillito
would
not
find
them
and
vernon
had
two
sons
ca
you
come
with
us
she
asked
mortimer
is
going
to
detroit
sorry
i
ca
said
cartwright
firmly
i
do
want
to
leave
you
but
business
calls
he
was
relieved
when
cartwright
let
it
go
clara
was
a
good
sort
and
seldom
argued
he
had
loafed
about
with
her
family
for
two
weeks
and
had
had
enough
moreover
business
did
call
if
the
found
out
before
his
boat
arrived
that
he
had
engaged
return
load
they
might
see
the
shippers
and
make
trouble
anyhow
they
would
use
some
effort
to
get
the
cargo
for
their
boats
sometimes
one
promised
regular
customers
a
drawback
on
standard
rates
i
write
to
vernon
in
the
morning
cartwright
remarked
telegraph
said
cartwright
who
did
not
lose
time
when
he
had
made
a
plan
when
the
lines
are
not
engaged
after
business
hours
you
can
send
a
a
long
message
at
less
than
the
proper
charge
cartwright
looked
pleased
although
she
was
rich
and
sometimes
generous
she
liked
small
economies
after
all
writing
a
letter
tiresome
she
said
telegrams
are
easy
will
you
get
me
a
form
chapter
ii
in
the
dark
in
the
morning
cartwright
told
the
porter
to
take
his
chair
to
the
beach
and
sat
down
in
a
shady
spot
he
had
not
seen
barbara
at
breakfast
and
was
rather
sorry
for
her
but
she
had
not
known
shillito
long
and
although
she
might
be
angry
for
a
time
her
hurt
could
not
be
deep
lighting
his
pipe
he
watched
the
path
that
led
between
the
pines
to
the
water
by
and
by
a
girl
came
out
of
the
shadow
and
going
to
the
small
looked
at
her
cartwright
imagined
she
did
not
see
him
and
studied
her
with
some
amusement
barbara
looked
impatient
people
did
not
often
keep
her
waiting
and
she
had
not
inherited
her
mother
placidity
she
had
a
touch
of
youthful
beauty
and
although
she
was
impulsive
and
rather
raw
cartwright
thought
her
charm
would
be
marked
when
she
met
the
proper
people
and
so
to
speak
got
toned
down
cartwright
meant
her
to
meet
the
proper
people
because
he
was
fond
of
barbara
she
had
grace
and
although
her
figure
was
slender
and
girlish
she
carried
herself
well
her
brown
eyes
were
steady
her
small
mouth
was
firm
and
as
a
rule
her
color
was
delicate
white
and
pink
now
it
was
high
and
cartwright
knew
she
was
angry
she
wore
boating
clothes
and
had
obviously
meant
to
go
on
the
lake
the
trouble
was
her
companion
had
not
arrived
hallo
said
cartwright
are
you
waiting
for
somebody
barbara
advanced
and
sat
down
on
a
rocky
ledge
no
she
said
i
not
waiting
cartwright
smiled
he
knew
barbara
temper
and
his
line
was
to
keep
her
resentment
warm
you
mean
you
have
given
him
up
and
wo
go
if
he
does
arrive
well
when
a
young
man
does
keep
his
appointment
it
the
proper
plan
she
blushed
but
tried
to
smile
i
do
know
if
you
clever
or
not
just
now
although
you
sometimes
do
see
things
the
others
miss
i
really
was
a
little
annoyed
i
lived
a
long
time
said
cartwright
however
perhaps
important
i
have
forgotten
i
was
young
i
think
your
brother
and
sister
never
were
very
young
they
were
soberer
than
me
when
i
knew
them
first
mortimer
a
stick
barbara
agreed
he
and
grace
have
a
calm
superiority
that
makes
one
savage
now
and
then
i
like
human
people
who
sometimes
let
themselves
go
she
stopped
and
cartwright
noted
her
wandering
glance
that
searched
the
beach
and
the
path
to
the
hotel
he
knew
whom
she
expected
and
thought
it
would
give
her
some
satisfaction
to
quarrel
with
the
fellow
cartwright
did
not
mean
to
soothe
her
shillito
ought
to
have
sent
his
apologies
when
he
found
he
could
not
come
he
said
barbara
glance
got
fixed
and
cartwright
knew
he
had
blundered
oh
she
said
now
i
begin
to
see
mother
kept
me
by
her
all
the
evening
but
mother
not
very
clever
and
mortimer
too
fastidious
to
meddle
unless
he
gets
a
dignified
part
of
course
the
plot
was
yours
cartwright
nodded
sometimes
he
used
tact
but
he
was
sometimes
brutally
frank
you
had
better
try
to
console
yourself
with
the
wheeler
boys
straight
young
fellows
shillito
is
gone
he
went
by
the
car
this
morning
and
it
unlikely
he
come
back
you
sent
him
off
said
barbara
and
her
eyes
sparkled
well
i
not
a
child
and
you
not
my
father
really
why
did
you
meddle
for
one
thing
he
not
your
sort
then
i
a
meddlesome
old
fellow
and
rather
fond
of
you
to
see
you
entangled
by
a
man
like
shillito
would
hurt
let
him
go
if
you
want
to
try
your
powers
you
find
a
number
of
honest
young
fellows
on
whom
you
can
experiment
the
boys
one
meets
in
this
country
are
a
pretty
good
sample
there
a
rude
vein
in
you
barbara
declared
one
sees
it
sometimes
although
you
sometimes
kind
anyhow
i
wo
be
bullied
and
controlled
i
not
a
shareholder
in
the
cartwright
line
i
do
know
if
it
important
but
why
do
you
like
mr
shillito
cartwright
eyes
twinkled
in
a
sense
he
could
justify
his
getting
rid
of
shillito
but
he
knew
barbara
and
doubted
if
she
could
be
persuaded
still
she
was
not
a
fool
and
he
would
give
her
something
to
think
about
it
possible
my
views
are
not
important
he
agreed
all
the
same
when
i
told
the
man
he
had
better
go
he
saw
the
force
of
my
arguments
he
went
and
i
think
his
going
is
significant
since
i
sooner
not
quarrel
i
leave
you
to
weigh
this
he
went
off
but
barbara
stopped
and
brooded
she
was
angry
and
humiliated
but
perhaps
the
worst
was
she
had
a
vague
notion
cartwright
might
be
justified
it
was
very
strange
shillito
had
gone
all
the
same
she
did
not
mean
to
submit
her
mother
placid
conventionality
had
long
irritated
her
one
got
tired
of
galling
rules
and
criticism
she
was
not
going
to
be
molded
into
a
calculating
prude
like
grace
or
a
prig
like
mortimer
they
did
not
know
the
ridiculous
they
cultivated
was
out
of
date
in
fact
she
had
had
enough
and
meant
to
rebel
then
she
began
to
think
about
shillito
his
carelessness
was
strangely
intriguing
he
stood
for
adventure
and
all
the
romance
she
had
known
besides
he
was
a
handsome
fellow
she
liked
his
reckless
twinkle
and
his
coolness
where
coolness
was
needed
for
all
that
she
would
not
acknowledge
him
her
lover
barbara
did
not
know
if
she
really
wanted
a
lover
yet
she
imagined
cartwright
had
got
near
the
mark
when
he
said
she
wanted
to
try
her
power
cartwright
was
keen
although
barbara
sensed
something
in
him
that
was
fierce
and
primitive
perhaps
nobody
else
could
have
bullied
shillito
mortimer
certainly
could
not
but
barbara
refused
to
speculate
about
the
means
cartwright
had
used
shillito
ought
not
to
have
gone
without
seeing
her
this
was
where
it
hurt
she
was
entitled
to
be
angry
and
then
she
started
for
a
page
boy
came
quietly
out
of
the
shade
a
note
miss
he
said
with
a
grin
i
was
to
give
it
you
when
nobody
was
around
barbara
heart
beat
but
she
gave
the
boy
a
quarter
and
opened
the
envelope
the
note
was
short
and
not
romantic
shillito
stated
he
had
grounds
for
imagining
it
might
not
reach
her
but
if
it
did
he
begged
she
would
give
him
her
address
when
she
left
the
hotel
he
told
her
where
to
write
and
added
if
she
could
find
a
way
to
get
his
letters
he
had
much
to
say
his
coolness
annoyed
barbara
but
he
had
excited
her
curiosity
and
she
was
intrigued
moreover
cartwright
had
tried
to
meddle
and
she
wanted
to
feel
she
was
cleverer
than
he
then
shillito
was
entitled
to
defend
himself
and
to
find
the
way
he
talked
about
would
not
be
difficult
barbara
knitted
her
brows
and
began
to
think
at
lunch
cartwright
told
her
they
were
going
to
join
the
vernons
in
the
woods
and
she
acquiesced
two
or
three
days
afterwards
they
started
and
at
the
station
she
gave
cartwright
her
hand
with
a
smiling
glance
but
cartwright
knew
his
and
was
not
altogether
satisfied
barbara
did
not
sulk
when
one
tried
to
baffle
her
she
fought
the
vernons
camp
was
like
others
winnipeg
people
pitch
in
the
lonely
woods
that
roll
west
from
fort
william
to
the
plains
it
is
a
rugged
country
pierced
by
angry
rivers
and
dotted
by
lakes
but
a
gasolene
launch
brought
up
supplies
the
tents
were
large
and
and
for
a
few
weeks
one
could
play
at
pioneering
without
its
hardships
the
vernons
were
hospitable
the
young
men
and
women
given
to
healthy
sport
and
cartwright
watching
barbara
fish
and
paddle
on
the
lake
banished
her
doubts
for
herself
she
did
not
miss
much
the
people
were
nice
and
the
cooking
was
really
good
when
two
weeks
had
gone
grace
and
barbara
sat
one
evening
among
the
stones
by
a
lake
the
evening
was
calm
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
shadow
of
the
pines
stretched
across
the
tranquil
water
now
and
then
the
reflections
trembled
and
a
languid
ripple
broke
against
the
driftwood
on
the
beach
in
the
distance
a
loon
called
but
when
its
wild
cry
died
away
all
was
very
quiet
grace
looked
across
the
lake
and
frowned
she
was
a
tall
girl
and
although
she
had
walked
for
some
distance
in
the
woods
her
clothes
were
hardly
crumpled
her
face
was
finely
molded
but
rather
colorless
her
hands
were
very
white
while
barbara
were
brown
her
dress
and
voice
indicated
cultivated
taste
but
the
taste
was
negative
as
if
grace
had
banished
carefully
all
that
jarred
and
then
had
stopped
it
was
characteristic
that
she
was
tranquil
although
she
had
grounds
for
disturbance
they
were
some
distance
from
camp
and
it
would
soon
be
dark
but
nothing
broke
the
gleaming
surface
of
the
lake
the
boat
that
ought
to
have
met
them
had
not
arrived
i
suppose
this
is
the
spot
where
harry
vernon
agreed
to
land
and
take
us
on
board
she
said
it
like
the
spot
i
understand
we
must
watch
out
for
a
point
opposite
an
island
with
big
trees
watch
out
grace
remarked
watch
out
is
good
canadian
barbara
rejoined
i
studying
the
language
and
find
it
expressive
and
plain
when
our
new
friends
talk
you
know
what
they
mean
besides
i
better
learn
their
idioms
because
i
might
stop
in
canada
if
somebody
urged
me
grace
gave
her
a
quiet
look
barbara
meant
to
annoy
her
or
perhaps
did
not
want
to
admit
she
had
mistaken
the
spot
now
grace
came
to
think
about
it
the
plan
that
the
young
men
should
meet
them
and
paddle
them
down
the
lake
was
barbara
i
do
see
why
we
did
go
with
harry
and
the
other
as
he
suggested
she
said
then
you
rather
dull
they
did
really
want
us
they
wanted
to
fish
to
know
when
people
might
be
bored
is
useful
but
there
are
a
number
of
bays
and
islands
they
may
go
somewhere
else
grace
insisted
oh
well
it
ought
to
amuse
harry
and
winter
to
look
for
us
and
if
they
annoyed
they
deserve
some
punishment
if
they
had
urged
us
very
much
to
go
i
would
have
gone
anyhow
you
need
bother
there
a
short
way
back
to
camp
by
the
old
loggers
trail
grace
said
nothing
she
thought
barbara
carelessness
was
forced
barbara
was
sometimes
moody
perhaps
she
felt
shillito
going
more
than
she
was
willing
to
own
for
all
that
the
fellow
was
gone
and
barbara
would
no
doubt
presently
be
consoled
if
mother
could
see
things
barbara
resumed
sometimes
one
feels
one
wants
a
guide
but
all
one
gets
is
a
ridiculous
platitude
from
her
code
one
has
puzzles
one
ca
solve
by
rules
however
since
she
does
see
there
no
use
in
bothering
i
your
elder
sister
but
you
do
give
me
your
confidence
barbara
mood
changed
and
her
laugh
was
touched
by
scorn
you
are
worse
than
mother
she
kind
but
ca
see
you
do
want
to
see
sooner
trust
my
he
a
very
human
old
ruffian
i
wish
i
had
a
real
girl
friend
but
you
tactfully
freeze
off
all
the
girls
i
like
it
strange
how
many
people
there
are
whom
virtuous
folks
approve
grace
missed
the
note
of
appeal
in
her
sister
bitterness
she
did
not
see
the
girl
as
disturbed
by
doubts
and
looked
in
perplexity
for
a
guiding
light
afterwards
when
understanding
was
too
late
grace
partly
understood
cartwright
is
not
a
ruffian
she
said
coldly
i
suppose
you
taking
the
proper
line
and
you
be
rather
noble
only
you
not
sincere
you
do
like
cartwright
and
know
he
like
you
all
the
same
it
not
important
we
were
talking
about
getting
home
and
since
the
boys
have
not
come
for
us
we
had
better
start
the
loon
had
flown
away
and
nothing
broke
the
surface
of
the
lake
the
shadows
had
got
longer
and
driven
back
the
light
thin
mist
drifted
about
the
islands
the
green
glow
behind
the
trunks
was
fading
and
it
would
soon
be
dark
in
winter
the
big
timber
wolves
prowl
about
the
woods
barbara
remarked
horrible
savage
brutes
i
expect
you
saw
the
heads
at
the
packer
house
still
one
understands
they
stay
north
until
the
frost
begins
she
got
up
and
when
they
set
off
grace
looked
regretfully
across
the
lake
for
she
would
sooner
have
gone
home
on
board
the
fishing
bateau
she
was
puzzled
the
bays
on
the
lake
were
numerous
and
islands
dotted
the
winding
reaches
but
it
was
strange
the
young
men
had
gone
to
the
wrong
spot
they
knew
the
lake
and
had
told
barbara
where
to
meet
them
in
the
meantime
however
the
important
thing
was
to
get
home
darkness
crept
across
the
woods
and
as
she
stumbled
along
the
uneven
trail
grace
got
disturbed
she
felt
the
daunting
loneliness
the
quiet
jarred
her
nerve
the
pines
looked
ghostly
in
the
gloom
they
were
ragged
and
strangely
stiff
it
looked
as
if
their
branches
never
moved
and
the
dark
gaps
between
the
trunks
were
somehow
forbidding
grace
did
not
like
canada
her
cultivation
was
artificial
but
canada
was
primitive
and
stern
in
the
towns
one
found
inventions
that
lightened
labor
and
brought
to
the
reach
of
all
a
physical
comfort
that
in
england
only
the
rich
enjoyed
but
the
contrasts
were
sharp
one
left
one
hotel
with
its
very
modern
furniture
noisy
elevators
and
telephones
and
plunged
into
the
wilderness
where
all
was
as
it
had
been
from
the
beginning
grace
shrank
from
primitive
rudeness
and
hated
adventure
living
by
rule
she
distrusted
all
she
did
not
know
she
thought
it
strange
that
barbara
who
feared
nothing
let
her
go
in
front
they
came
to
a
pool
all
round
the
black
tops
of
the
pines
cut
the
sky
the
water
was
dark
and
sullen
in
the
gloom
the
trail
followed
its
edge
and
when
a
loon
wild
cry
rang
across
the
woods
grace
stopped
she
knew
the
cry
of
the
lonely
bird
that
haunts
the
canadian
wilds
but
it
had
a
strange
note
like
mocking
laughter
grace
disliked
the
loon
when
its
voice
first
disturbed
her
sleep
at
the
fishing
camp
she
hated
it
afterwards
go
on
said
barbara
sharply
for
a
moment
or
two
grace
stood
still
she
did
not
want
to
stop
but
something
in
barbara
voice
indicated
strain
if
barbara
were
startled
it
was
strange
then
not
far
off
a
branch
cracked
and
the
rustled
as
if
they
were
gently
pushed
aside
oh
grace
cried
something
is
creeping
through
the
bush
then
do
stop
said
barbara
perhaps
it
a
wolf
grace
clutched
her
dress
and
ran
at
first
she
thought
she
heard
barbara
behind
but
she
owned
she
had
not
her
sister
pluck
and
fear
gave
her
speed
she
must
get
as
far
as
possible
from
the
pool
before
she
stopped
besides
she
imagined
something
broke
through
the
undergrowth
near
the
trail
but
her
heart
beat
and
she
could
not
hear
properly
at
length
her
breath
got
labored
and
she
was
forced
to
stop
all
was
quiet
and
the
quiet
was
daunting
barbara
was
not
about
and
when
grace
called
did
not
reply
grace
tried
to
brace
herself
perhaps
she
ought
to
go
back
but
she
could
not
she
shrank
from
the
terror
that
haunted
the
dark
then
she
began
to
argue
that
to
go
back
was
illogical
if
barbara
had
lost
her
way
she
could
not
help
it
was
better
to
push
on
to
the
camp
and
send
men
who
knew
the
woods
to
look
for
her
sister
she
set
off
and
presently
saw
with
keen
relief
the
light
of
a
fire
reflected
on
calm
water
chapter
iii
barbara
vanishes
grace
arrival
was
greeted
by
a
shout
and
when
she
stopped
in
front
of
the
a
group
of
curious
people
surrounded
her
the
double
roof
of
the
big
tent
was
extended
horizontally
and
a
lamp
hanging
from
a
pole
gave
a
brilliant
light
grace
would
sooner
the
light
had
been
dim
for
she
was
hot
and
her
clothes
were
torn
and
wet
with
dew
besides
she
must
tell
her
tale
and
admit
that
she
had
not
played
a
heroic
part
where
barbara
cartwright
asked
i
do
know
harry
vernon
did
not
meet
us
and
we
started
home
by
the
loggers
trail
i
lost
barbara
by
the
pool
something
in
the
bush
tried
to
creep
up
to
us
a
wolf
i
think
oh
shucks
remarked
a
frank
winnipeg
girl
who
did
not
like
miss
hyslop
in
summer
you
ca
find
a
wolf
south
of
broken
range
looks
as
if
you
were
scared
for
nothing
but
i
ca
see
why
barbara
beat
you
at
hitting
up
the
pace
others
asked
questions
and
when
grace
got
breath
she
tried
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
some
of
the
group
looked
thoughtful
and
vernon
said
nothing
can
have
hurt
barbara
and
if
she
has
lost
her
way
she
can
not
wander
far
because
she
must
be
in
the
loop
between
the
river
and
the
lake
but
harry
did
go
to
meet
you
and
when
he
found
you
had
not
come
back
went
off
again
with
bob
i
expect
they
soon
arrive
with
barbara
they
waited
for
and
then
when
the
splash
of
paddles
stole
out
of
the
dark
ran
down
to
the
beach
presently
a
bateau
crossed
the
beam
of
light
and
grounded
a
young
man
helped
barbara
out
and
gave
her
his
arm
you
must
bother
harry
i
can
walk
all
right
she
said
get
hold
said
vernon
you
not
going
to
walk
if
you
obstinate
i
carry
you
barbara
leaned
upon
his
arm
but
her
color
was
high
and
her
look
strained
when
he
helped
her
across
the
stones
harry
vernon
was
a
tall
thin
wiry
canadian
with
a
quiet
face
when
he
got
to
the
tent
he
opened
the
curtain
and
beckoning
cartwright
pushed
barbara
inside
you
give
her
some
supper
and
i
chase
the
others
off
he
said
the
little
girl
tired
and
must
be
disturbed
barbara
gave
him
a
grateful
look
and
the
blood
came
to
his
sunburned
skin
i
am
a
little
tired
she
declared
and
added
too
quietly
for
cartwright
to
hear
you
a
white
man
vernon
pulled
the
curtain
across
and
joining
the
others
lighted
a
cigarette
the
girls
stopped
at
false
point
two
miles
short
of
the
spot
we
fixed
he
said
i
reckon
bob
directions
were
not
plain
enough
since
we
did
come
along
they
started
back
by
the
loggers
trail
while
we
went
to
look
for
them
by
the
other
track
at
the
pool
they
thought
they
heard
a
wolf
that
so
miss
hyslop
yes
said
grace
i
ran
away
and
thought
i
heard
barbara
following
but
what
happened
afterwards
she
fell
hurt
her
foot
had
to
stop
and
then
could
make
good
time
we
found
her
limping
along
and
shoved
through
the
bush
for
the
river
so
she
need
walk
well
i
think
that
all
it
was
plausible
but
grace
was
not
altogether
satisfied
moreover
she
imagined
vernon
was
not
and
noted
that
vernon
gave
him
a
thoughtful
glance
all
the
same
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
and
she
went
to
her
tent
at
daybreak
vernon
left
the
camp
and
when
he
reached
the
pool
walked
round
its
edge
and
then
sat
down
and
lighted
his
pipe
a
few
yards
in
front
a
number
of
faint
marks
were
printed
on
a
belt
of
sand
by
and
by
he
heard
steps
and
frowned
when
winter
came
out
from
an
opening
in
the
row
of
trunks
they
were
friends
and
bob
was
a
very
good
sort
but
vernon
would
sooner
he
had
stopped
away
hallo
he
said
why
have
you
come
along
i
lost
my
winter
replied
it
was
hooked
to
my
belt
and
i
thought
the
clip
let
go
when
we
helped
miss
hyslop
over
the
big
log
a
bully
knife
i
wanted
to
find
the
thing
he
paused
and
smiled
when
he
resumed
i
reckon
you
pulled
out
of
camp
to
meditate
vernon
hesitated
had
winter
stopped
a
few
yards
off
he
would
have
begun
some
banter
and
drawn
him
away
from
the
pool
bob
was
a
woodsman
and
his
eyes
were
keen
the
sun
was
however
rising
behind
the
pines
and
a
beam
of
light
touched
the
sand
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
hide
the
marks
in
fact
vernon
imagined
bob
had
seen
them
no
he
said
i
thought
i
try
to
trail
the
wolf
miss
hyslop
talked
about
looks
as
if
you
found
some
tracks
winter
remarked
well
not
a
wolf
he
sat
down
opposite
vernon
a
man
i
saw
another
at
a
soft
spot
he
followed
the
girls
from
the
lake
and
stopped
for
some
time
i
allow
i
reckoned
on
something
like
that
vernon
made
an
experiment
might
have
been
a
packer
going
to
a
logging
camp
or
perhaps
an
indian
shucks
said
winter
although
he
gave
vernon
a
sympathetic
smile
there
are
no
indians
about
the
lake
and
packers
boots
do
make
marks
like
those
a
city
boot
and
a
city
man
a
fellow
who
wise
to
the
bush
lifts
his
feet
anyhow
i
reckon
he
does
belong
to
your
crowd
a
sure
thing
vernon
agreed
i
can
fix
where
all
the
boys
were
besides
if
somebody
in
our
lot
had
wanted
to
talk
to
miss
hyslop
he
would
have
hung
around
in
the
woods
my
mother
pretty
fastidious
about
her
guests
well
i
own
up
the
thing
bothers
me
winter
nodded
harry
was
frank
and
honest
and
bob
imagined
he
had
felt
barbara
hyslop
charm
he
was
sorry
for
harry
the
thing
was
awkward
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
he
asked
to
begin
with
i
going
to
hide
these
tracks
after
all
i
do
see
much
light
i
suppose
i
ought
to
tell
my
mother
and
put
cartwright
wise
but
i
wo
spying
on
a
girl
and
telling
is
mean
all
the
same
i
surely
bothered
in
a
sense
my
mother
accountable
for
her
guests
and
the
girl
nice
i
like
it
if
i
could
talk
to
the
man
nothing
doing
there
he
watch
out
well
we
hide
up
his
tracks
and
look
for
my
knife
think
grace
hyslop
knew
the
job
was
put
up
i
do
said
vernon
dryly
i
reckon
she
was
puzzled
but
that
all
you
could
persuade
miss
hyslop
her
sister
liked
adventures
in
the
dark
anyhow
the
thing
done
with
we
have
got
to
let
it
go
they
went
off
and
winter
pondered
harry
had
got
something
of
a
knock
perhaps
he
was
taking
the
proper
line
anyhow
it
was
the
line
harry
would
take
but
bob
doubted
the
girl
was
very
young
and
the
man
who
met
her
in
the
dark
was
obviously
a
wastrel
when
they
returned
for
breakfast
barbara
had
joined
the
others
and
wore
soft
indian
moccasins
bob
looked
at
harry
and
understood
his
frown
harry
had
played
up
when
he
helped
her
home
but
he
no
doubt
thought
the
game
ought
to
stop
bob
wondered
whether
barbara
knew
because
she
turned
her
head
when
harry
advanced
after
breakfast
vernon
carrying
a
small
bottle
joined
cartwright
party
under
the
pines
outside
the
tent
the
dew
was
drying
and
the
water
shone
like
a
mirror
but
it
was
cool
in
the
shade
barbara
occupied
a
and
rested
her
foot
on
a
stone
cartwright
knitted
and
grace
studied
a
philosophical
book
her
rule
was
to
cultivate
her
mind
for
a
fixed
time
every
day
harry
vernon
strolled
up
to
the
group
and
cartwright
put
down
her
knitting
you
kind
but
the
child
obstinate
and
wo
let
me
see
her
foot
she
said
to
vernon
it
comfortable
now
barbara
remarked
when
something
that
hurt
you
stops
hurting
i
think
it
better
to
leave
it
alone
besides
one
does
want
to
bother
people
you
wo
bother
me
and
i
fix
your
foot
in
two
or
three
minutes
so
it
wo
hurt
again
vernon
declared
the
elixir
famous
and
i
have
known
it
to
miss
i
always
carry
some
when
we
camp
in
the
woods
she
turned
to
her
son
tell
barbara
how
soon
i
cured
you
when
you
hurt
your
arm
you
want
to
burn
miss
hyslop
with
the
elixir
it
does
burn
much
you
said
you
hardly
felt
it
and
soon
after
i
rubbed
your
arm
the
pain
was
gone
harry
glanced
at
barbara
and
saw
she
was
embarrassed
although
her
mouth
was
firm
since
she
did
not
mean
to
let
vernon
examine
her
supposititious
injury
his
business
was
to
help
and
he
laughed
miss
hyslop
skin
is
not
like
my
tough
hide
you
certainly
fixed
my
arm
but
it
was
a
drastic
cure
and
i
think
miss
hyslop
ought
to
refuse
i
try
to
indulge
you
like
a
dutiful
son
but
you
are
not
her
mother
i
am
her
mother
and
she
will
not
indulge
me
cartwright
remarked
with
languid
grievance
and
barbara
gave
harry
a
quick
searching
glance
his
face
was
inscrutable
but
she
wondered
how
much
he
knew
she
felt
shabby
and
ashamed
when
vernon
went
off
with
the
elixir
harry
sat
down
if
you
could
bring
cartwright
out
i
might
persuade
my
father
to
come
along
he
said
the
old
man
likes
cartwright
declares
he
a
sport
he
is
a
grace
remarked
i
think
he
used
to
shoot
but
it
some
time
since
harry
looked
at
barbara
and
his
eyes
twinkled
american
english
oxford
english
but
your
people
are
beginning
to
use
it
and
miss
barbara
learns
fast
all
the
same
running
the
independent
freighters
is
quite
a
sporting
proposition
and
i
imagine
cartwright
generally
makes
good
the
old
man
and
i
would
back
him
to
put
over
an
awkward
deal
every
time
my
husband
is
a
good
business
man
cartwright
agreed
but
you
belong
to
winnipeg
and
i
understand
his
business
is
at
montreal
the
steamship
understood
something
like
that
until
cartwright
put
them
wise
you
see
we
western
people
grow
the
wheat
that
goes
down
the
lakes
and
when
the
got
to
know
an
independent
boat
was
coming
out
they
went
round
and
offered
montreal
shippers
and
brokers
a
drawback
on
the
rates
that
is
if
the
shippers
gave
them
all
their
stuff
they
meet
their
bills
for
a
rebate
some
time
afterwards
bully
for
the
shippers
but
it
left
the
western
men
who
raised
the
wheat
in
the
cold
well
while
the
got
after
him
at
montreal
cartwright
came
west
and
booked
all
the
grain
he
could
load
before
it
started
off
when
the
got
wise
the
cargo
was
in
the
independent
freighter
hold
cartwright
surely
a
business
man
barbara
laughed
and
cartwright
languidly
agreed
but
grace
frowned
although
she
did
not
approve
cartwright
he
was
the
head
of
her
house
and
to
know
his
clever
tricks
were
something
of
a
joke
hurt
her
dignity
harry
saw
her
frown
anyhow
cartwright
promise
stands
he
resumed
if
he
ran
his
boat
across
half
empty
he
make
good
you
can
trust
him
he
went
off
and
barbara
mused
unhappily
she
thought
harry
had
talked
to
help
her
over
an
awkward
moment
and
she
was
grateful
but
disturbed
it
looked
as
if
he
knew
something
and
he
might
know
much
all
the
same
when
he
talked
about
her
she
agreed
cartwright
was
bold
and
clever
and
although
he
was
sometimes
not
very
scrupulous
people
did
trust
him
barbara
wished
she
had
his
cleverness
and
his
talent
for
removing
obstacles
there
were
obstacles
in
her
path
and
the
path
was
dark
yet
she
had
promised
to
take
it
and
must
make
good
she
tried
to
banish
her
doubts
and
began
to
talk
after
lunch
she
allowed
one
of
the
party
to
help
her
on
board
a
canoe
the
afternoon
was
calm
and
the
light
breeze
that
now
and
then
sighed
in
the
hardly
ruffled
the
shining
water
in
the
evening
when
the
straight
trunks
cut
against
a
blaze
of
gold
and
green
they
sat
by
a
smudge
fire
that
kept
off
the
mosquitoes
and
sang
to
an
accompaniment
of
banjos
and
mandolins
barbara
sang
with
the
others
but
it
cost
her
an
effort
the
tranquil
day
was
nearly
done
and
she
felt
it
was
the
last
tranquillity
she
might
know
for
long
her
companions
were
frank
and
kind
canadians
but
her
sort
and
she
was
going
to
make
a
bold
plunge
with
another
who
was
not
yet
she
knew
one
could
not
rebel
for
nothing
and
she
had
pluck
the
light
faded
behind
the
trees
a
loon
wild
cry
rang
across
the
dark
water
and
the
party
went
to
bed
in
the
morning
grace
awoke
cartwright
quietly
barbara
is
gone
she
said
ridiculous
said
cartwright
she
is
gone
her
clothes
are
not
about
but
we
must
be
calm
and
not
disturb
the
camp
vernon
ought
to
know
but
nobody
else
you
see
it
important
cartwright
saw
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
her
hostess
knew
it
plain
i
must
give
harry
my
confidence
to
some
extent
vernon
said
and
went
to
look
for
her
son
she
found
him
going
off
for
a
swim
and
when
she
told
her
tale
he
frowned
in
a
way
perhaps
i
accountable
but
we
talk
about
this
again
he
said
get
cartwright
on
board
the
launch
and
come
along
yourself
as
soon
as
bob
inside
his
clothes
we
start
but
bob
vernon
began
bob
and
i
need
a
partner
if
miss
hyslop
did
leave
the
settlement
on
the
night
express
she
be
hitting
the
trail
through
the
woods
for
the
united
states
you
must
hustle
vernon
left
him
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
fast
motor
launch
swung
out
from
the
landing
and
sped
down
river
with
a
white
wave
at
her
bows
grace
watched
the
boat
vanish
behind
a
wooded
point
and
then
went
to
her
tent
she
was
horribly
angry
and
shocked
barbara
had
cheated
her
and
disgraced
them
all
chapter
iv
the
girl
on
the
platform
the
vancouver
express
was
running
in
the
dark
through
the
woods
west
of
fort
william
after
the
rain
of
early
summer
that
undermine
the
track
are
numerous
and
the
express
had
been
delayed
now
however
the
road
was
good
and
the
engineer
drove
his
big
locomotive
with
throttle
wide
open
black
smoke
blew
about
the
rocking
cars
cinders
rattled
on
the
roofs
and
showers
of
sparks
sped
past
the
windows
the
wheels
roared
on
shaking
trestles
and
now
and
then
awoke
an
echoing
clang
of
steel
for
the
company
was
doubling
the
track
and
replacing
the
wooden
bridges
by
metal
this
was
george
lister
business
and
he
lounged
in
a
corner
of
a
and
rather
drowsily
studied
some
calculations
he
was
bound
west
from
montreal
and
in
the
morning
would
resume
his
labors
at
a
construction
camp
there
was
much
to
be
done
and
the
construction
bosses
who
had
sent
for
him
were
getting
impatient
lister
thoughts
wandered
from
the
figures
he
liked
his
occupation
and
admitted
that
he
had
been
lucky
but
began
to
see
he
had
gone
as
far
as
he
could
expect
to
go
the
trouble
was
he
had
not
enjoyed
the
scientific
training
that
distinguished
the
men
who
got
important
posts
his
mechanical
career
began
in
the
of
a
on
the
lakes
and
he
had
entered
the
railroad
company
service
when
shipping
was
bad
and
steamers
were
laid
up
although
he
had
studied
for
a
term
or
two
at
mcgill
university
he
knew
his
drawbacks
sometimes
promotion
was
given
for
merit
but
for
the
most
part
the
men
who
made
progress
came
from
technical
colleges
and
famous
engineering
works
an
accident
in
the
ranges
on
the
pacific
slope
when
a
mountain
locomotive
jumped
the
track
and
plunged
down
a
precipitous
hillside
gave
lister
his
first
chance
he
got
the
locomotive
back
to
the
line
and
being
rewarded
by
a
better
post
stubbornly
pushed
himself
nearer
the
front
now
however
it
looked
as
if
he
must
stop
rules
were
not
often
relaxed
in
favor
of
men
who
had
no
friends
yet
lister
wondered
not
long
since
a
gentleman
whose
word
carried
some
weight
at
the
company
office
had
visited
the
construction
camp
with
his
indulged
daughter
the
girl
was
clever
adventurous
and
interested
by
pioneer
work
and
lister
had
helped
her
to
some
thrills
she
obviously
enjoyed
she
had
with
his
guidance
driven
a
locomotive
across
a
shaking
bridge
fired
a
heavy
blasting
shot
and
caught
big
gray
trout
from
his
canoe
although
lister
used
some
reserve
their
friendship
ripened
and
when
she
left
she
hinted
she
had
some
power
she
might
be
willing
to
use
on
his
behalf
all
the
same
lister
was
proud
the
girl
belonged
to
a
circle
he
could
not
enter
and
if
he
got
promotion
it
must
be
by
his
merits
he
was
not
the
man
to
get
forward
by
intrigue
and
the
clever
use
of
a
influence
he
had
no
talent
for
that
kind
of
thing
he
let
it
go
and
tried
to
concentrate
on
his
calculations
by
and
by
the
colored
porter
stopped
to
tell
him
his
berth
was
fixed
and
the
passengers
were
going
to
bed
lister
nodded
put
up
his
papers
and
then
lighted
a
cigarette
the
was
hot
the
light
the
rocking
lamp
threw
about
had
hurt
his
eyes
and
he
thought
he
would
go
out
on
the
platform
for
a
few
minutes
he
went
the
draught
that
swept
the
gap
between
the
cars
was
bracing
and
cool
there
was
a
moon
he
saw
water
shine
and
dark
pines
stream
past
the
snorting
of
the
locomotive
broke
in
a
measured
beat
through
the
roll
of
wheels
the
rocks
threw
back
confused
echoes
about
the
clanging
cars
then
the
gleam
among
the
trees
got
wider
and
lister
knew
they
were
nearing
a
trestle
that
crossed
an
arm
of
a
lake
in
fact
he
had
wondered
whether
he
would
be
sent
to
pull
down
the
bridge
and
rebuild
it
with
steel
he
sat
down
on
the
little
with
his
back
against
the
door
the
platform
had
not
the
new
guards
the
company
was
then
fitting
there
was
an
opening
in
the
rails
and
one
could
go
down
the
steps
when
the
train
was
running
the
moonlight
touched
the
back
of
the
car
in
front
but
lister
was
in
the
gloom
and
when
the
vestibule
door
opposite
opened
he
was
annoyed
if
somebody
wanted
to
go
through
the
train
he
must
get
up
a
girl
came
out
of
the
other
car
and
seizing
the
rails
looked
down
she
was
in
the
light
and
lister
remarked
that
she
did
not
wear
traveling
clothes
he
thought
her
small
knitted
cap
short
dress
and
loose
jacket
indicated
that
she
had
come
from
a
summer
camp
then
she
turned
her
head
and
he
saw
her
face
was
rather
white
and
her
look
was
strained
it
was
obvious
that
something
had
disturbed
her
the
girl
did
not
see
him
and
while
he
wondered
whether
he
ought
to
get
up
she
put
her
foot
on
the
step
and
leaned
out
as
if
she
weighed
the
possibility
of
jumping
off
she
swung
back
when
the
cars
lurched
round
a
curve
and
the
measured
roll
of
wheels
changed
to
a
sharp
broken
din
the
train
was
running
on
to
the
trestle
and
lister
saw
the
water
shine
below
the
platform
he
got
up
and
moving
quietly
seized
the
girl
arm
and
pulled
her
from
the
rails
a
jolt
might
throw
you
off
he
said
she
looked
up
with
a
start
and
the
blood
came
to
her
skin
but
she
gave
him
a
quick
searching
glance
lister
was
athletic
his
face
was
bronzed
by
frost
and
sun
and
his
look
was
frank
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
her
color
faded
does
the
train
stop
soon
she
asked
if
the
engineer
lucky
we
wo
stop
until
he
makes
the
next
and
it
some
distance
she
turned
with
a
quick
nervous
movement
and
glanced
at
the
door
lister
imagined
she
was
afraid
somebody
might
come
out
could
one
persuade
or
bribe
the
conductor
to
pull
up
lister
hesitated
he
knew
the
train
gang
and
was
a
railroad
boss
but
the
company
was
spending
a
large
sum
in
order
to
cut
down
the
and
somebody
must
account
for
all
delay
i
think
not
you
see
unless
there
a
washout
or
the
track
is
blocked
nothing
is
allowed
to
stop
the
vancouver
express
the
girl
glanced
at
the
door
again
and
then
gave
him
an
appealing
look
but
i
must
get
off
i
ought
to
have
come
on
board
i
want
to
go
east
towards
montreal
and
not
to
winnipeg
although
he
was
not
romantic
lister
was
moved
she
was
very
young
and
her
distress
was
obvious
somehow
he
felt
her
grounds
for
wanting
to
leave
the
train
were
good
indeed
he
rather
thought
she
had
meant
to
jump
off
had
they
not
run
on
to
the
bridge
yet
for
him
to
stop
the
express
would
be
ridiculous
the
conductor
and
engineer
would
pay
for
his
meddling
with
quiet
firmness
he
pulled
the
girl
farther
from
the
opening
of
the
rails
we
stop
long
before
we
get
to
winnipeg
he
said
soothingly
then
possible
we
be
held
up
by
a
blocked
track
are
pretty
numerous
on
this
piece
of
line
however
if
we
do
stop
and
you
get
down
you
be
left
in
the
woods
oh
she
said
that
not
important
all
i
want
is
to
get
off
very
well
said
lister
if
we
are
held
up
i
look
for
you
but
i
do
know
if
the
jolting
platform
is
very
safe
had
you
better
go
back
to
your
car
she
gave
him
a
quick
glance
and
he
thought
she
braced
herself
i
not
going
back
i
ca
it
impossible
lister
was
curious
but
hesitated
about
trying
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
the
girl
was
afraid
of
somebody
and
seeing
no
other
help
she
trusted
him
then
you
had
better
come
with
me
and
i
find
you
a
berth
where
you
wo
be
disturbed
he
said
she
followed
him
with
a
confidence
he
thought
moving
and
when
they
met
the
conductor
he
took
the
man
aside
that
all
right
said
the
other
nobody
going
to
bother
her
while
i
about
lister
returned
to
the
but
the
adventure
had
given
him
a
pleasant
thrill
and
he
did
not
feel
sleepy
he
got
out
his
calculations
and
tried
to
interest
himself
until
a
man
entered
the
car
the
fellow
was
rather
handsome
and
his
clothes
were
good
but
lister
thought
he
looked
perplexed
he
gave
lister
a
keen
glance
and
went
on
through
the
car
some
minutes
afterwards
he
came
back
frowning
savagely
stopped
in
front
of
lister
as
if
he
meant
to
speak
hesitated
and
went
out
by
the
vestibule
it
was
plain
the
fellow
had
gone
to
look
for
the
girl
and
had
not
found
her
the
conductor
had
seen
to
that
lister
smiled
but
admitted
that
the
thing
was
puzzling
the
man
was
older
than
the
girl
although
he
was
not
old
enough
to
be
her
father
if
he
were
her
husband
she
would
not
have
run
away
from
him
and
it
did
not
look
as
if
he
were
her
lover
lister
saw
no
light
but
since
it
was
obvious
she
feared
the
man
he
resolved
if
possible
to
help
her
to
escape
some
time
afterwards
the
whistle
pierced
the
roll
of
wheels
and
lister
going
to
the
platform
saw
a
big
electric
shine
like
a
star
the
cars
were
slowing
and
he
imagined
the
operator
had
tried
to
run
a
construction
train
across
the
section
before
the
express
came
up
they
would
probably
stop
for
a
minute
at
the
intersection
of
the
main
and
side
tracks
hurrying
through
the
train
lister
found
the
conductor
who
look
him
to
a
curtained
berth
and
the
girl
got
down
she
was
dressed
and
wore
her
knitted
cap
if
you
are
resolved
to
go
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
off
lister
said
i
must
go
she
replied
and
although
lister
remarked
that
her
hands
trembled
as
she
smoothed
her
crumpled
dress
her
voice
was
steady
very
well
he
said
come
along
when
he
opened
the
vestibule
door
the
train
was
stopping
and
the
beam
from
a
standing
locomotive
flooded
the
track
with
dazzling
light
for
a
moment
the
girl
hesitated
but
when
lister
went
down
the
steps
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
jumped
lister
felt
her
tremble
and
was
himself
conscious
of
some
excitement
he
did
not
know
if
he
was
rash
or
not
but
since
she
meant
to
go
speed
was
important
because
the
man
from
whom
she
wanted
to
escape
might
see
them
on
the
line
he
went
to
the
waiting
engine
in
front
of
a
long
row
of
ballast
cars
on
which
a
big
gravel
plough
loomed
faintly
in
the
dark
who
on
board
he
asked
a
man
he
knew
looked
out
from
the
cab
window
hallo
lister
i
on
board
with
jake
we
going
to
malcolm
cut
for
gravel
washout
mixed
things
operator
reckoned
he
could
rush
us
through
then
you
stop
and
get
water
at
the
tank
lister
interrupted
will
you
make
it
before
the
comes
along
we
ought
to
make
it
ahead
wires
all
right
that
way
nothing
on
the
road
lister
turned
to
the
girl
if
you
going
east
you
must
buy
a
new
ticket
at
malcolm
have
you
money
i
have
some
she
said
and
stopped
and
lister
imagined
she
had
not
until
then
thought
about
money
and
had
not
much
you
take
this
lady
to
malcolm
roberts
and
put
her
down
where
she
can
get
to
the
station
he
said
to
the
engineer
nobody
will
see
you
have
a
passenger
but
if
the
agent
curious
i
fix
the
thing
with
him
it
was
breaking
rules
but
the
man
knew
lister
and
lister
knew
he
could
be
trusted
he
took
some
bills
from
his
wallet
and
as
he
helped
the
girl
up
the
steps
pushed
the
paper
into
her
hand
she
turned
to
the
cab
door
and
lister
imagined
she
was
hardly
conscious
of
the
money
he
had
given
her
her
color
was
high
but
her
look
indicated
keen
relief
oh
she
said
i
owe
you
much
you
do
know
all
you
have
done
i
will
not
forget
somebody
waved
a
lantern
a
whistle
shrieked
and
the
locomotive
bell
began
to
toll
lister
jumped
back
and
seized
the
rails
above
the
platform
steps
as
the
car
lurched
forward
they
moved
faster
the
beam
of
the
faded
and
the
train
rolled
on
into
the
dark
chapter
v
shillito
gets
away
when
the
train
started
lister
did
not
go
to
his
berth
his
curiosity
was
excited
and
he
wondered
whether
he
had
been
rash
now
he
came
to
think
about
it
the
girl
was
attractive
and
perhaps
this
to
some
extent
accounted
for
his
willingness
to
help
moreover
she
was
young
and
it
was
possible
her
relations
had
put
her
in
the
man
control
if
so
his
meddling
could
not
be
justified
after
a
time
he
heard
the
whistle
and
imagined
the
train
was
going
to
stop
at
a
small
station
to
which
mails
were
brought
from
some
mining
camps
the
neighboring
country
was
rugged
and
lonely
but
a
trail
ran
south
through
the
woods
to
the
american
frontier
when
the
cars
stopped
he
pushed
down
the
window
and
looked
out
small
trees
grew
along
the
track
and
the
light
from
the
cars
touched
their
branches
the
line
was
checkered
by
illuminated
patches
and
belts
of
gloom
lister
heard
somebody
open
the
baggage
car
and
then
saw
a
man
run
along
the
line
beside
the
train
another
jumped
off
a
platform
and
they
met
not
far
from
lister
window
the
man
who
got
down
was
the
fellow
who
had
gone
through
the
car
looking
for
the
girl
the
locomotive
pump
throbbed
noisily
and
lister
could
not
hear
their
talk
but
he
thought
they
argued
the
one
who
came
up
the
line
looked
impatient
and
put
his
hand
on
his
companion
arm
as
if
to
urge
him
away
the
other
stepped
back
and
his
gesture
implied
that
he
refused
to
go
the
train
was
long
the
passengers
were
asleep
and
the
men
no
doubt
imagined
nobody
saw
them
lister
thought
the
fellow
who
got
down
did
not
know
the
girl
was
gone
and
did
not
mean
to
leave
the
train
without
her
the
light
touched
the
men
faces
and
it
was
obvious
that
one
was
angry
and
the
other
disturbed
the
scene
intrigued
lister
it
was
like
watching
an
act
in
a
cinema
play
of
which
one
did
not
know
the
plot
after
a
minute
or
two
a
lantern
flashed
up
the
track
the
bell
tolled
and
the
nearer
man
jumped
back
on
the
step
lister
heard
a
vestibule
door
shut
and
then
the
throb
of
wheels
began
the
fellow
on
the
line
frowned
and
threw
out
his
hands
angrily
from
the
movement
of
his
lips
lister
thought
he
swore
but
the
car
rolled
past
him
and
he
melted
into
the
dark
lister
went
to
his
berth
but
did
not
undress
much
of
the
night
had
gone
he
would
reach
his
camp
soon
after
daybreak
and
the
train
would
only
stop
long
enough
for
him
to
jump
off
he
could
sleep
in
his
clothes
for
an
hour
or
two
a
slackening
of
the
roll
of
wheels
wakened
him
and
he
got
out
of
his
berth
but
the
big
lamps
were
burning
and
when
he
went
to
the
door
he
saw
dawn
had
not
come
it
was
obvious
they
had
not
reached
the
construction
camp
lister
shivered
and
was
returning
to
his
berth
when
the
conductor
opened
the
door
our
luck
surely
not
good
he
said
they
pulling
us
up
at
maple
if
it
not
a
washout
somebody
will
get
fired
he
went
off
grumbling
but
when
the
train
stopped
came
back
with
a
trooper
of
the
mounted
police
where
the
guy
you
told
me
to
watch
out
for
he
asked
lister
said
he
did
not
know
and
offered
to
go
with
them
and
help
find
the
man
it
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
see
the
end
of
the
play
when
they
opened
a
vestibule
door
a
man
came
out
of
the
car
in
front
and
stopped
as
if
he
were
dazzled
by
the
beam
from
the
conductor
lifted
lamp
that
the
fellow
lister
shouted
he
thought
the
other
saw
the
trooper
uniform
because
he
stepped
back
quickly
the
door
however
was
shut
when
he
let
go
the
handle
the
had
engaged
nothing
doing
that
way
said
the
trooper
my
partner
coming
along
behind
you
you
corraled
all
right
i
a
warrant
for
you
louis
shillito
the
police
work
in
couples
and
the
situation
was
plain
one
trooper
had
begun
his
search
at
the
front
of
the
train
the
other
at
the
back
and
shillito
hearing
the
first
turn
the
passengers
out
of
their
berths
had
tried
to
steal
away
and
met
the
other
his
face
got
strangely
white
but
lister
thought
it
was
rather
with
rage
than
fear
his
lips
drew
back
in
a
snarl
and
the
veins
swelled
on
his
forehead
he
occupied
the
center
of
the
illuminated
circle
thrown
by
the
lamp
and
his
savage
gaze
was
fixed
lister
saw
he
was
not
looking
at
the
policeman
but
at
him
blast
you
shillito
shouted
if
you
had
butted
in
cut
it
out
said
the
trooper
hands
up
we
got
you
do
make
trouble
shillito
hand
went
behind
him
it
was
possible
he
felt
for
the
door
knob
but
the
trooper
meant
to
run
no
risks
although
he
had
put
down
his
rifle
and
taken
out
his
handcuffs
he
jumped
forward
across
the
platform
and
shillito
bent
sideways
to
avoid
his
spring
the
fellow
was
athletic
and
his
quick
indicated
he
was
something
of
a
boxer
the
policeman
was
embarrassed
by
his
handcuffs
and
young
shillito
seized
him
and
threw
him
against
the
rails
close
to
the
gap
where
the
steps
went
down
the
trooper
gasped
his
grasp
got
slack
and
his
body
slipped
along
the
rails
it
looked
as
if
shillito
would
throw
him
down
the
steps
and
lister
jumped
he
saw
shillito
hand
go
up
and
next
moment
got
a
heavy
blow
for
all
that
he
seized
the
man
and
held
on
though
blood
ran
into
his
eyes
and
he
felt
dizzy
shillito
struggled
like
a
savage
animal
and
lister
imagined
the
trooper
did
not
help
much
he
got
his
arms
round
his
antagonist
and
tried
to
pull
him
down
shillito
was
trying
to
reach
the
opening
in
the
rails
after
a
moment
or
two
lister
felt
his
muscles
getting
slack
lurched
forward
and
saw
nothing
in
front
he
plunged
out
from
the
gap
struck
a
step
with
his
foot
and
somebody
fell
on
him
then
he
thought
he
heard
a
and
knew
nothing
more
by
and
by
somebody
pulled
him
to
his
feet
and
he
saw
the
conductor
holding
his
arm
a
group
of
excited
passengers
stood
round
them
in
the
light
that
shone
from
the
train
and
some
others
ran
along
the
edge
of
the
woods
the
trooper
and
shillito
were
gone
lister
head
hurt
he
felt
shaky
and
when
he
wiped
his
face
his
hand
was
wet
with
blood
my
head
cut
i
hit
something
when
i
fell
he
said
shillito
socked
it
to
you
pretty
good
the
conductor
replied
and
waved
his
lamp
all
aboard
he
shouted
and
pushed
lister
up
the
steps
when
they
reached
the
platform
the
car
jolted
and
lister
sat
down
with
his
back
against
the
door
my
legs
wo
hold
me
he
said
in
an
apologetic
voice
did
shillito
get
off
knocked
out
the
trooper
and
made
the
bush
the
other
fellow
was
way
back
along
the
train
the
conductor
replied
they
want
him
for
embezzlement
and
will
soon
get
on
his
trail
but
the
broke
the
wires
and
i
reckon
he
cross
the
frontier
ahead
now
you
come
along
and
i
try
to
fix
your
cut
lister
went
and
soon
after
a
porter
helped
him
into
his
berth
his
head
hurt
and
he
felt
very
dull
and
slack
but
he
slept
and
when
he
woke
bright
sunshine
streamed
into
the
standing
car
and
he
saw
the
train
had
stopped
at
winnipeg
soon
afterwards
the
conductor
and
one
of
the
station
officials
put
him
into
an
automobile
if
the
reporters
get
after
you
remember
you
not
to
talk
about
the
girl
he
said
to
the
conductor
the
other
nodded
and
signed
the
driver
to
start
the
car
rolled
off
and
stopped
at
the
house
of
a
doctor
who
dressed
the
cut
on
lister
head
and
ordered
him
a
week
rest
lister
went
to
a
hotel
and
in
the
morning
found
a
romantic
narrative
of
shillito
escape
in
the
newspaper
but
was
relieved
to
note
that
nothing
was
said
about
the
girl
the
report
however
stated
that
a
passenger
who
tried
to
help
the
police
had
got
badly
hurt
and
shillito
had
vanished
in
the
woods
the
police
had
not
found
his
trail
and
it
was
possible
he
would
reach
the
american
frontier
lister
thought
the
thing
was
done
with
and
when
a
letter
arrived
from
the
construction
office
telling
him
to
stay
until
he
felt
able
to
resume
his
work
resigned
himself
to
rather
dreary
idleness
for
some
days
his
head
ached
and
he
could
not
go
out
the
other
guests
were
engaged
in
the
city
and
there
was
nobody
to
whom
he
could
talk
he
got
badly
bored
and
it
was
a
relief
when
one
afternoon
the
gentleman
he
had
met
at
the
construction
camp
arrived
with
his
daughter
for
all
that
lister
was
surprised
duveen
was
a
man
of
some
importance
miss
duveen
was
a
fashionable
young
lady
and
lister
had
imagined
they
had
forgotten
him
he
took
his
guests
to
a
corner
of
the
spacious
rotunda
where
a
throbbing
electric
fan
blew
away
the
flies
and
duveen
gave
him
a
cigarette
the
did
not
give
your
name
but
we
soon
found
out
who
was
the
plucky
passenger
he
said
with
a
friendly
smile
ruth
thought
like
to
see
you
and
since
i
was
engaged
this
afternoon
we
came
along
i
did
want
to
come
but
i
really
think
you
proposed
the
visit
ruth
remarked
oh
well
said
duveen
i
do
know
if
it
important
but
perhaps
we
ought
to
make
lister
talk
lister
declared
he
wanted
to
talk
and
duveen
said
presently
i
see
why
you
butted
in
for
a
moment
or
two
lister
hesitated
he
was
resolved
to
say
nothing
about
the
girl
it
was
obvious
she
would
not
like
her
adventure
known
but
he
must
be
cautious
duveen
was
clever
and
he
thought
miss
duveen
gave
him
a
curious
glance
the
trooper
was
young
and
i
sympathized
with
his
keenness
looked
as
if
it
was
his
first
important
job
and
he
meant
to
make
good
a
romantic
impulse
duveen
remarked
and
laughed
well
when
one
is
young
i
expect
it
hard
to
stand
off
while
a
fight
going
on
all
the
same
it
strange
you
did
sympathize
with
the
fellow
who
was
corraled
that
youth
natural
instinct
although
i
allow
it
not
often
justified
the
trooper
was
corraled
he
put
down
his
rifle
and
shillito
had
a
gun
i
reckon
it
was
the
sharp
butt
of
a
heavy
automatic
that
cut
my
head
then
i
did
like
the
fellow
he
come
through
the
train
before
and
looked
a
smart
crook
he
is
a
crook
and
got
away
with
a
big
wad
of
the
lumber
firm
money
however
you
were
rash
to
jump
for
a
man
with
a
pistol
you
did
know
he
use
the
butt
all
the
same
you
look
brighter
than
we
thought
and
can
take
a
rest
i
expect
the
construction
office
wo
rush
you
back
until
you
fit
i
want
to
get
back
loafing
round
the
hotel
is
dreary
and
my
job
not
getting
on
although
i
ordered
to
lie
off
this
wo
count
for
much
i
be
made
accountable
for
getting
behind
duveen
said
nothing
for
a
moment
or
two
but
he
looked
thoughtful
and
lister
imagined
miss
duveen
studied
him
quietly
he
did
not
belong
to
the
duveens
circle
he
was
ruder
in
fact
it
was
rather
strange
to
see
these
people
sitting
with
him
engaged
in
friendly
talk
although
now
he
thought
about
it
miss
duveen
had
not
said
much
she
was
a
pretty
girl
and
lister
liked
her
fashionable
dress
somehow
ruth
duveen
harmonized
with
the
tall
pillars
and
rich
ornamentation
of
the
rotunda
one
felt
she
belonged
to
spacious
rooms
duveen
clothes
were
in
quiet
taste
he
wore
a
big
diamond
and
looked
commanding
one
felt
this
was
a
man
whose
word
carried
weight
you
something
of
a
hustler
he
remarked
with
a
smile
for
all
that
you
got
a
nasty
knock
and
your
quitting
for
a
time
is
justified
well
if
you
feel
lonesome
come
along
and
dine
at
our
hotel
then
go
and
see
the
american
opera
i
told
the
show
is
good
lister
made
some
excuses
but
duveen
would
not
be
refused
when
we
stopped
at
your
camp
you
made
things
smooth
for
us
you
gave
ruth
some
thrills
showed
her
the
romance
of
and
generally
helped
her
to
a
good
time
anyhow
the
thing
is
fixed
send
the
car
for
you
they
went
off
soon
afterwards
and
lister
mused
and
smoked
he
had
hardly
expected
to
meet
the
duveens
again
and
wondered
whether
he
owed
the
visit
to
ruth
or
her
father
he
had
remarked
at
the
camp
that
she
was
generally
indulged
well
it
was
plain
duveen
could
help
him
and
lister
was
ambitious
but
he
frowned
and
pulled
himself
up
he
was
not
going
to
intrigue
for
promotion
and
use
a
girl
friendship
in
order
to
force
his
chiefs
to
see
his
merits
things
like
that
were
done
but
not
by
him
it
demanded
qualities
he
did
not
think
were
his
moreover
he
did
not
know
if
ruth
duveen
was
his
friend
she
was
attractive
but
he
imagined
she
was
clever
all
the
same
if
he
could
get
the
doctor
to
fix
his
bandage
so
as
to
make
it
inconspicuous
he
would
dine
with
the
duveens
chapter
vi
winnipeg
beach
lister
went
to
the
opera
with
his
hosts
and
was
moved
by
the
music
and
the
feeling
that
he
was
one
of
a
careless
crowd
for
the
most
part
his
life
had
been
strenuous
and
the
crowds
he
knew
were
rude
his
home
was
a
bare
shack
sometimes
built
on
the
alkali
plains
and
sometimes
in
the
tangled
woods
from
daybreak
until
dusk
fell
hoarse
shouts
the
clank
of
rails
the
beat
of
heavy
hammers
filled
his
ears
and
often
the
uproar
did
not
stop
at
dark
when
a
soft
muskeg
swallowed
the
new
track
he
must
watch
by
the
flaring
noisy
ploughs
throw
showers
of
gravel
from
the
ballast
cars
labor
and
concentration
had
left
their
mark
lister
muscles
were
hard
but
his
body
and
face
were
thin
he
looked
and
alert
his
talk
was
direct
and
quick
as
a
rule
his
skin
was
brown
but
now
the
brown
was
gone
and
the
lines
on
his
face
were
deeper
his
injury
accounted
for
something
and
he
felt
the
reaction
from
a
strain
he
had
hardly
noted
while
it
must
be
borne
although
he
had
not
altogether
hidden
his
bandage
and
his
clothes
were
not
the
latest
fashion
ruth
duveen
was
satisfied
somehow
he
looked
a
finer
type
than
the
business
men
in
the
neighboring
stalls
one
felt
the
man
clean
virility
and
got
a
hint
of
force
lister
was
highly
strung
the
music
stirred
his
imagination
and
when
the
curtain
went
down
the
light
and
glitter
the
perfume
that
drifted
about
the
women
dress
and
the
society
of
his
attractive
companion
gave
him
a
curious
thrill
he
began
to
see
he
had
missed
much
ambitions
that
had
forced
him
to
struggle
for
scope
to
use
fresh
efforts
took
another
turn
life
was
not
all
labor
ruth
duveen
had
enlightened
him
he
studied
her
she
had
grace
and
charm
it
was
much
to
enjoy
for
one
evening
the
society
of
a
girl
like
this
duveen
went
off
between
the
acts
to
meet
his
friends
but
ruth
stopped
and
talked
her
smile
was
gracious
and
lister
let
himself
go
he
told
her
about
adventures
on
the
track
and
asked
about
her
life
in
the
cities
perhaps
it
was
strange
but
she
did
not
look
bored
and
when
the
curtain
went
down
for
the
last
time
he
felt
a
pang
the
evening
was
gone
and
in
a
day
or
two
he
must
resume
his
labor
in
the
wilds
lister
did
not
cheat
himself
he
knew
the
strange
romantic
excitement
he
had
indulged
would
not
be
his
again
when
they
went
down
the
passage
ruth
gave
him
a
smiling
glance
and
saw
his
mouth
was
firm
you
look
rather
tired
she
said
have
we
tired
you
lister
turned
and
his
eyes
were
thoughtful
she
had
stopped
to
fasten
her
cloak
and
the
people
pushing
by
forced
her
to
his
side
an
electric
lamp
burned
overhead
and
her
beauty
moved
him
he
noted
the
heavy
coils
of
her
dark
hair
her
delicate
color
and
the
grace
of
her
form
i
not
at
all
tired
he
said
i
feel
remarkably
braced
and
keen
as
if
i
waked
up
from
sleep
in
fact
i
think
i
have
awakened
ruth
laughed
she
saw
he
was
not
smiling
and
his
graveness
gave
her
a
sense
of
power
he
had
owned
with
typical
frankness
that
she
had
moved
him
sometimes
to
wake
up
suddenly
gives
one
a
jolt
she
said
however
you
will
soon
get
calm
again
in
the
woods
he
sensed
something
provocative
and
challenging
in
her
voice
but
he
would
not
play
up
i
wonder
he
said
quietly
in
a
way
the
proper
line
to
go
to
sleep
again
sometimes
one
dreams
i
expect
you
dream
about
locomotives
breaking
through
trestles
and
plunging
into
muskegs
he
laughed
they
things
i
know
and
safe
to
dream
about
all
the
same
i
rather
expect
i
be
haunted
by
lights
and
music
pretty
dresses
and
faces
he
stopped
and
ruth
remarked
if
these
have
charm
there
are
no
very
obvious
grounds
for
your
going
without
you
can
command
a
locomotive
and
winnipeg
not
very
far
from
your
camp
but
we
stopping
the
people
and
i
ca
fix
this
clasp
she
moved
and
the
opera
cloak
fell
back
from
her
arm
which
was
uncovered
but
for
the
filmy
sleeve
that
reached
a
little
below
the
shoulder
he
noted
its
fine
curves
and
the
silky
smoothness
of
her
skin
although
he
fastened
the
clasp
with
a
workman
firm
touch
he
thrilled
then
the
crowd
forced
them
on
and
they
found
duveen
waiting
by
the
car
when
they
stopped
at
lister
hotel
ruth
said
we
are
going
to
winnipeg
beach
saturday
would
you
like
to
come
duveen
nodded
a
happy
thought
i
got
to
talk
to
some
business
people
who
make
ruth
tired
if
you
come
along
i
need
bother
about
her
that
how
one
father
argues
ruth
exclaimed
lister
hesitated
i
was
told
to
lie
off
because
i
was
hurt
if
i
fit
to
enjoy
an
excursion
i
fit
to
work
you
too
scrupulous
young
man
have
a
good
time
when
it
possible
or
you
be
sorry
afterwards
i
reckon
you
justified
to
take
all
the
company
will
give
it
was
caution
not
scruples
suppose
i
meet
one
of
the
railroad
chiefs
i
fix
him
duveen
rejoined
your
bosses
wo
get
after
you
when
you
belong
to
my
party
anyhow
we
look
out
for
you
the
car
rolled
off
and
lister
going
to
the
rotunda
lighted
a
cigarette
and
mused
ruth
duveen
had
beauty
he
liked
her
but
must
use
caution
since
he
imagined
the
friendship
she
had
given
him
was
something
of
an
indulged
girl
caprice
then
he
began
to
think
about
the
girl
he
had
met
on
board
the
train
now
he
was
able
undisturbed
to
draw
her
picture
he
saw
she
too
had
charm
but
she
was
not
at
all
like
ruth
the
strange
thing
was
one
did
not
note
if
she
were
beautiful
or
not
in
a
way
this
did
not
matter
her
pluck
and
firmness
fixed
one
interest
lister
threw
away
his
cigarette
he
was
poor
and
not
romantic
the
girl
he
had
helped
had
vanished
and
after
their
excursion
he
hardly
expected
to
see
ruth
again
ruth
was
kind
but
she
would
soon
forget
him
when
he
was
gone
he
would
go
to
winnipeg
beach
with
her
and
then
return
to
the
woods
and
let
his
job
absorb
him
in
the
meantime
his
head
had
begun
to
ache
and
he
went
to
bed
the
saturday
morning
was
typical
of
winnipeg
in
summer
the
fresh
northwest
breeze
that
sweeps
the
manitoba
plains
had
dropped
dark
rolled
about
the
sky
but
the
sun
was
hot
and
an
enervating
humidity
brooded
over
the
town
the
perspiring
crowd
in
main
street
moved
slackly
the
saloon
bars
were
full
and
the
groups
of
flocking
to
the
station
wore
a
languid
look
lister
met
his
hosts
in
the
marble
waiting
hall
where
a
panorama
of
canadian
scenery
closes
the
view
between
the
rows
of
stately
pillars
duveen
had
brought
three
or
four
nervous
business
men
a
rather
imposing
lady
and
ruth
and
they
got
on
board
a
local
train
soon
after
lister
arrived
winnipeg
beach
was
then
beginning
to
attract
from
the
prairie
town
one
could
row
and
fish
in
sheltered
bays
and
adventure
on
board
a
gasoline
launch
into
the
northern
wilds
boating
however
had
no
charm
for
duveen
friends
the
excursion
was
an
opportunity
for
friendly
business
talk
and
when
lunch
was
over
ruth
and
lister
went
out
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
hotel
there
was
no
wind
a
few
dark
clouds
floated
motionless
overhead
but
outside
their
shadow
the
lake
shone
like
glass
running
back
until
it
melted
into
faint
reflections
on
the
horizon
a
varnished
launch
flashed
in
the
sun
and
trailed
a
long
white
wake
across
the
water
do
you
want
to
stay
and
talk
to
mrs
knapp
ruth
asked
i
do
not
said
lister
anyhow
i
imagine
knapp
does
want
to
talk
to
me
i
not
a
man
ruth
laughed
oh
well
when
you
speculate
at
the
board
of
trade
a
railroad
engineer
is
not
a
useful
friend
i
suppose
i
ought
to
stay
but
the
things
one
ought
to
do
are
tiresome
let
go
on
the
lake
lister
got
a
canoe
and
fixing
a
cushion
for
ruth
picked
up
the
paddle
where
shall
we
go
north
as
far
as
you
can
let
get
away
from
the
boats
and
trippers
and
imagine
we
back
in
the
woods
where
you
helped
me
catch
the
big
gray
trout
then
you
liked
it
at
the
construction
camp
lister
remarked
it
was
a
pretty
rude
spot
for
an
indulged
city
girl
ruth
said
smiling
well
perhaps
i
got
all
the
satisfaction
dinner
parties
and
dances
and
the
society
at
hotels
can
give
i
knew
the
men
who
handle
finance
and
work
the
wires
behind
the
scenes
but
i
wanted
to
know
the
others
who
do
the
strenuous
things
and
keep
the
country
going
i
came
and
you
helped
me
to
understand
the
romance
of
the
lakes
and
woods
lister
did
not
remember
if
he
had
tried
to
do
so
and
thought
he
had
not
all
the
same
the
girl
was
keen
and
interested
in
summer
it
was
not
hard
to
feel
the
lonely
sheets
of
water
and
tangled
bush
were
touched
by
romance
then
perhaps
everybody
felt
at
times
a
vague
longing
for
the
rude
and
primitive
but
he
was
not
a
philosopher
and
dipping
the
paddle
he
drove
the
canoe
across
the
tranquil
lake
in
the
meantime
he
imagined
ruth
studied
him
with
quiet
amusement
and
wondered
whether
she
thought
he
was
not
playing
up
he
did
not
mean
to
play
up
the
game
was
intricate
and
if
he
were
rash
might
cost
him
much
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
and
jacket
and
effort
had
brought
back
the
color
to
his
skin
his
thin
face
had
the
clean
bronze
tint
of
an
indian
the
soft
shirt
showed
the
lines
of
his
athletic
figure
but
lister
was
not
conscious
of
this
he
knew
his
drawbacks
but
not
all
his
advantages
when
he
had
gone
some
distance
and
the
hotel
and
houses
began
to
melt
into
the
background
he
stopped
and
let
the
canoe
drift
how
far
shall
we
go
he
asked
ruth
indicated
a
rocky
point
cut
off
by
the
glimmering
reflection
that
seemed
to
float
above
the
horizon
let
see
what
is
on
the
other
side
now
and
then
one
wants
to
know
exploration
intriguing
do
you
think
so
sometimes
in
a
practical
sense
when
a
height
of
land
cuts
the
landscape
i
wonder
whether
one
could
find
an
easy
for
the
track
across
the
summit
that
about
as
far
as
my
imagination
goes
oh
well
said
ruth
exploration
like
that
is
useful
and
one
run
much
risk
but
risk
and
adventure
appeal
to
some
people
lister
resumed
paddling
the
girl
had
charm
and
he
was
young
if
he
were
not
cautious
there
might
be
some
risk
for
him
he
was
not
a
clever
philanderer
and
ruth
and
duveen
had
been
kind
by
and
by
a
puff
of
cool
wind
touched
his
hot
skin
and
he
looked
round
a
black
cloud
had
rolled
up
and
there
were
lines
on
the
water
we
may
get
a
blow
and
some
thunder
he
remarked
shall
we
go
back
not
yet
we
make
the
point
first
if
it
does
thunder
summer
storms
do
last
he
paddled
harder
and
a
small
white
wave
lapped
the
canoe
bows
the
sky
was
getting
dark
and
now
the
lines
that
streaked
the
lake
were
white
but
the
wind
was
astern
and
they
were
going
fast
the
glimmering
reflections
had
vanished
and
the
rocks
ahead
rose
sharply
from
the
leaden
water
the
point
was
some
distance
off
but
lister
knew
he
must
reach
it
soon
a
flash
of
forked
lightning
leaped
from
the
sky
and
touched
the
lake
there
was
a
long
rumbling
peal
and
then
a
humming
noise
began
astern
angry
white
ripples
splashed
about
the
canoe
and
lumps
of
hail
beat
lister
head
then
while
the
thunder
rolled
across
the
sky
the
canoe
swerved
it
was
blowing
hard
the
high
bow
and
stern
caught
the
wind
the
strength
was
needed
to
hold
her
straight
with
the
single
paddle
if
he
brought
her
round
he
could
not
paddle
to
windward
and
to
steer
across
the
sea
that
would
soon
get
up
might
be
dangerous
they
must
make
the
point
and
land
he
threw
ruth
his
jacket
for
spray
had
begun
to
fly
and
the
drops
from
the
paddle
blew
on
board
put
on
the
thing
i
got
to
work
he
said
in
a
few
minutes
his
work
was
hard
short
white
waves
rolled
past
the
canoe
lurched
and
swerved
and
lister
knew
if
she
swung
off
across
wind
and
sea
she
might
capsize
he
must
keep
her
running
and
let
the
combers
split
against
her
pointed
stern
the
combers
were
getting
large
and
their
hissing
tops
surged
by
some
height
above
the
gunwale
but
so
long
as
he
could
keep
her
before
them
they
would
not
come
on
board
when
her
bows
went
up
she
sheered
as
if
she
meant
to
shoot
across
the
hollow
left
by
the
sea
that
rolled
by
he
stopped
her
with
a
and
then
drove
hard
ahead
for
he
must
have
speed
to
steer
when
the
next
sea
came
on
in
the
meantime
the
lightning
flickered
about
the
lake
and
between
the
flashes
all
was
nearly
dark
the
tops
of
the
waves
tossed
against
leaden
cloud
and
he
could
hardly
see
the
rocks
for
which
he
steered
by
and
by
however
the
point
stood
out
close
ahead
the
trees
on
the
summit
bent
in
the
wind
spray
leaped
about
the
bowlders
where
the
white
foam
rolled
he
must
go
round
and
find
a
landing
to
lee
but
to
go
round
he
must
cross
the
belt
of
breaking
water
with
the
savage
wind
abeam
the
canoe
shipped
some
water
and
riding
in
on
a
comber
crest
narrowly
missed
a
rock
that
lifted
its
top
for
a
moment
out
of
the
foam
then
lister
drove
her
in
behind
the
point
and
helped
ruth
to
land
on
a
gravel
beach
her
eyes
sparkled
and
he
saw
she
had
not
been
daunted
we
all
right
now
but
we
have
got
to
stay
until
the
storm
blows
out
he
said
they
found
shelter
in
a
hollow
of
the
cliff
and
sat
among
the
driftwood
while
the
rain
that
blotted
out
the
lake
drove
overhead
the
deluge
did
not
reach
them
and
the
cold
was
going
you
go
back
on
monday
ruth
said
at
length
lister
smiled
with
humorous
resignation
i
must
the
strange
thing
is
when
i
left
my
job
before
i
was
keen
to
get
back
now
i
rather
stop
and
loaf
then
you
were
not
bored
at
winnipeg
not
at
all
lister
declared
if
it
would
give
me
a
holiday
like
this
i
get
hurt
again
i
expect
the
woods
get
dreary
then
perhaps
one
does
make
much
progress
by
sticking
to
the
track
do
you
want
to
get
into
the
office
where
the
big
plans
are
made
i
do
know
said
lister
thoughtfully
on
the
track
you
all
right
if
you
know
your
job
at
headquarters
you
need
qualities
i
do
know
are
mine
anyhow
i
not
likely
to
get
there
if
i
want
or
not
ruth
gave
him
a
curious
glance
sometimes
one
friends
can
help
would
you
really
like
a
headquarters
post
lister
moved
abruptly
and
his
mouth
got
firm
perhaps
ruth
exaggerated
her
father
importance
but
it
was
possible
duveen
could
get
him
promotion
all
the
same
lister
saw
what
his
taking
the
job
implied
he
must
give
up
his
independence
and
be
duveen
man
moreover
if
the
girl
meant
to
help
she
had
some
grounds
for
doing
so
he
thrilled
and
was
tempted
but
he
thought
hard
it
looked
as
if
she
liked
him
and
was
perhaps
willing
to
embark
upon
a
sentimental
adventure
but
he
thought
this
was
all
she
would
not
marry
a
poor
man
no
he
said
with
a
touch
of
awkwardness
i
reckon
i
had
better
stick
to
the
track
to
know
where
you
properly
belong
is
something
and
if
i
took
the
other
job
my
chiefs
would
soon
find
me
out
you
modest
ruth
remarked
one
likes
modest
people
but
do
you
think
you
obstinate
when
the
trail
you
hit
goes
uphill
obstinacy
useful
if
you
wo
take
help
you
may
be
long
reaching
the
top
but
we
let
it
go
the
wind
has
dropped
much
how
can
we
get
back
we
must
wait
lister
replied
with
a
twinkle
the
trouble
about
an
adventure
is
when
you
start
you
often
forced
to
stay
with
it
and
put
it
over
that
sometimes
costs
more
than
you
reckon
ruth
eyes
sparkled
but
she
forced
a
smile
logical
people
make
me
tired
but
why
do
you
imagine
i
have
the
pluck
to
pay
i
do
said
lister
i
no
grounds
to
imagine
anything
like
that
my
business
was
to
take
care
of
you
and
i
ought
to
have
seen
the
storm
was
coming
now
i
mad
because
i
did
watch
out
sometimes
you
rather
nice
ruth
remarked
you
know
i
made
you
go
on
all
the
same
we
must
start
as
soon
as
possible
lister
got
up
presently
and
launched
the
canoe
the
thunder
had
gone
but
the
breeze
was
strong
and
angry
white
waves
rolled
up
the
lake
to
drive
the
canoe
to
windward
was
heavy
labor
and
while
she
lurched
slowly
across
the
combers
the
sun
got
low
lister
wet
hands
blistered
and
his
arms
ached
but
he
swung
the
paddle
stubbornly
and
at
length
the
houses
and
hotel
stood
out
from
the
beach
when
they
got
near
the
landing
ruth
looked
ahead
the
train
ready
to
pull
out
she
exclaimed
can
you
make
it
lister
tried
his
face
got
dark
with
effort
and
his
hands
bled
but
in
a
few
minutes
he
ran
the
canoe
aground
ruth
jumped
out
and
they
reached
the
station
as
the
bell
began
to
toll
duveen
waved
to
them
from
the
track
by
the
front
of
the
train
and
then
jumped
on
board
and
lister
pushed
ruth
up
the
steps
of
the
last
car
the
car
was
and
crowded
by
returning
but
the
conductor
who
did
not
know
lister
and
miss
duveen
declared
all
the
train
was
full
and
they
must
stay
where
they
were
when
he
went
off
and
locked
the
vestibule
lister
looked
about
all
the
seats
and
much
of
the
central
passage
were
occupied
for
the
most
part
by
young
men
and
women
some
were
frankly
lovers
and
did
not
look
disturbed
by
the
banter
of
their
friends
lister
was
embarrassed
for
ruth
sake
until
he
saw
with
some
surprise
that
she
studied
the
others
with
amused
curiosity
looking
down
he
met
her
twinkling
glance
and
thought
it
something
like
a
challenge
his
embarrassment
got
worse
one
could
not
talk
because
of
the
noise
and
to
shout
was
ridiculous
he
must
stand
in
a
cramped
pose
and
try
not
to
fall
against
ruth
when
the
cars
rocked
he
admitted
that
his
proper
background
was
the
rude
construction
camp
and
it
was
something
of
a
relief
when
they
rolled
into
winnipeg
duveen
car
was
at
the
station
and
ruth
stopped
for
a
moment
before
she
got
on
board
you
start
on
monday
and
we
will
be
out
of
town
i
wish
you
good
luck
lister
thanked
her
and
when
she
got
into
the
car
she
gave
him
a
curious
smile
i
think
i
liked
you
better
in
the
woods
she
said
and
the
car
rolled
off
chapter
vii
lister
dissatisfaction
soon
after
his
return
from
winnipeg
lister
stood
one
evening
by
a
length
of
track
planned
to
cut
out
an
awkward
curve
the
new
line
ran
into
a
muskeg
that
sucked
down
brush
and
logs
and
the
loads
of
numerous
gravel
trains
angry
foremen
declared
one
could
not
fill
up
the
bog
and
lister
knew
the
heads
of
the
construction
office
grumbled
about
the
delay
he
was
tired
for
he
had
been
strenuously
occupied
since
morning
but
could
not
persuade
himself
that
the
work
had
made
much
progress
small
trees
lay
in
tangled
rows
about
the
fresh
gravel
farther
back
the
standing
bush
ran
in
a
broken
line
against
the
fading
light
in
front
thin
mist
drifted
across
the
muskeg
where
slender
trunks
rose
from
the
quaking
mud
not
far
off
a
high
wooden
trestle
carried
the
rails
across
a
ravine
the
bridge
would
presently
be
rebuilt
with
steel
but
in
the
meantime
the
frame
was
open
and
the
gaps
between
the
ties
were
wide
it
was
getting
dark
and
noisy
threw
up
pillars
of
white
fire
the
line
had
sunk
in
the
afternoon
and
it
was
necessary
to
lift
the
rails
and
fill
up
the
subsidence
before
the
next
gravel
train
arrived
lister
was
angry
and
puzzled
for
he
had
pushed
the
across
to
near
the
other
side
but
the
rails
had
not
sunk
in
the
new
belt
but
in
ground
over
which
the
trains
had
run
by
and
by
a
man
joined
him
and
remarked
the
boys
have
got
the
ties
up
but
i
reckon
they
wo
fix
the
track
for
three
or
four
hours
looks
as
if
the
blamed
muskeg
was
going
to
beat
us
she
ca
beat
us
lister
rejoined
impatiently
the
trouble
is
hauling
the
stuff
she
swallows
runs
up
construction
costs
and
that
counts
against
us
did
you
leave
willis
with
the
gang
the
other
laughed
i
did
not
he
was
tired
wanted
something
at
the
office
and
allowed
he
stop
and
take
a
smoke
hustle
him
out
when
you
go
along
kemp
i
sooner
our
chiefs
down
east
had
kept
that
young
man
the
job
not
soft
enough
for
him
however
i
he
lighted
the
lamp
across
the
bridge
willis
has
friends
kemp
remarked
meaningly
and
indicated
a
reflection
behind
the
trees
the
lamp
burning
lister
glanced
at
the
trembling
light
i
expect
it
good
enough
for
the
engineer
but
the
flame
not
steady
willis
has
bothered
to
get
the
pressure
right
it
possible
he
did
wait
until
she
warmed
the
oil
the
powerful
lamp
had
been
carried
across
the
bridge
in
order
to
warn
the
engineer
of
the
gravel
train
who
on
his
last
journey
had
run
to
the
end
of
the
line
the
light
could
be
seen
for
some
distance
up
the
track
i
got
after
hardie
about
making
good
time
we
must
dump
his
load
in
the
soft
spot
before
we
stop
lister
resumed
he
coming
now
climbing
the
height
of
land
said
kemp
he
let
her
go
all
out
when
he
makes
the
top
a
measured
throb
rolled
across
the
woods
and
as
the
noise
got
louder
the
beat
of
the
exhaust
marked
the
progress
of
the
train
the
explosive
snorts
indicated
that
the
locomotive
labored
up
the
last
steep
pitch
and
lister
sat
down
by
the
rails
he
was
tired
and
would
not
be
needed
until
the
gravel
plough
threw
the
rattling
ballast
off
the
cars
after
a
few
moments
he
looked
up
for
a
man
came
out
of
the
gloom
hello
willis
i
you
been
taking
a
quiet
smoke
that
so
said
the
other
i
hustled
round
since
and
imagined
the
gang
could
get
along
for
half
an
hour
without
my
watching
you
want
to
leave
something
to
your
foremen
lister
said
nothing
he
did
not
choose
his
helpers
but
tried
to
make
the
best
use
of
those
the
bosses
sent
willis
had
some
useful
qualities
but
he
was
slack
and
got
sulky
if
one
drove
him
hard
the
young
man
had
come
from
the
of
a
famous
works
in
the
meantime
the
rumble
of
the
gravel
train
grew
to
a
pulsating
roar
the
locomotive
had
crossed
the
divide
and
was
running
furiously
down
grade
the
track
was
uneven
but
the
engineer
had
been
on
board
since
daybreak
and
no
doubt
wanted
to
finish
his
job
she
in
the
rock
cut
now
kemp
remarked
hardie
ought
to
throttle
down
when
he
runs
out
and
sees
the
light
lister
listened
the
swelling
note
indicated
that
the
train
had
left
the
cut
but
it
did
not
look
as
if
the
engineer
was
pulling
up
she
coming
along
pretty
fast
said
willis
if
he
does
snub
her
soon
she
jump
the
steel
and
take
the
muskeg
next
moment
lister
was
on
his
feet
hardie
was
driving
too
fast
lister
doubted
if
he
could
stop
before
the
heavy
train
plunged
through
the
broken
track
the
unsteady
white
flicker
behind
the
trees
had
sunk
and
changed
to
smoky
red
if
looked
as
if
the
oil
was
not
vaporizing
properly
and
the
lamp
was
going
out
when
the
engineer
saw
the
light
it
would
be
too
late
get
the
boys
off
the
track
i
try
to
fix
the
lamp
lister
shouted
and
started
for
the
bridge
the
errand
was
not
his
willis
had
lighted
the
lamp
moreover
one
might
have
sent
a
workman
but
when
a
job
was
urgent
lister
went
himself
the
job
was
urgent
and
dangerous
unless
he
made
good
speed
he
would
meet
the
train
on
the
bridge
and
the
cylinders
of
the
locomotive
projected
beyond
the
edge
the
track
was
rough
and
fresh
gravel
rolled
under
his
feet
now
and
then
he
struck
a
and
nearly
fell
it
had
got
dark
and
among
the
trees
the
gloom
was
deep
one
could
not
see
the
ties
yet
he
must
run
and
his
breath
got
labored
and
his
heart
thumped
he
did
not
know
where
the
train
was
only
that
it
was
near
the
woods
throbbed
with
a
savage
din
the
big
cars
loaded
with
rattling
gravel
clanged
and
roared
as
they
plunged
down
grade
lister
hardly
thought
he
could
stop
the
train
it
looked
as
if
he
would
be
caught
on
the
trestle
but
he
meant
to
go
on
he
did
not
argue
about
it
he
was
rather
moved
by
instinctive
stubbornness
at
moments
of
strain
one
does
not
argue
and
logic
has
no
appeal
character
counts
for
all
and
lister
followed
his
bent
his
job
was
urgent
and
must
be
carried
out
when
he
reached
the
bridge
he
saw
white
threads
of
water
between
the
timbers
of
the
open
frame
the
spacing
of
the
ties
was
not
regular
and
if
he
stepped
short
or
too
far
he
would
go
through
then
if
he
did
not
strike
a
brace
he
would
fall
upon
the
rocks
in
the
stream
all
the
same
he
saw
the
blaze
of
the
pick
out
the
trees
across
the
ravine
and
sprang
on
to
the
bridge
somehow
he
hit
the
ties
perhaps
by
subconscious
judgment
and
perhaps
by
good
luck
then
he
felt
loose
gravel
under
his
feet
and
thrilled
with
a
strange
fierce
satisfaction
his
breath
was
labored
and
his
body
wet
by
sweat
but
the
moving
beam
had
not
reached
the
lamp
he
was
going
to
make
it
when
the
black
front
of
a
gravel
car
leaped
out
of
the
gloom
he
jumped
off
the
track
the
locomotive
pushed
the
cars
the
train
was
long
and
the
lamp
was
but
a
few
yards
off
it
had
not
gone
out
although
the
flame
had
sunk
to
a
faint
red
jet
that
would
not
be
seen
in
the
dust
his
hands
shook
but
he
gave
the
pump
a
few
strokes
and
turned
the
valve
wheel
the
red
jet
got
white
and
leaped
higher
and
lister
pumping
hard
looked
up
the
track
big
cars
rocking
and
banging
rushed
past
in
a
cloud
of
dust
bits
of
gravel
struck
him
and
rattled
against
the
lamp
the
blurred
dark
figures
of
men
who
sat
upon
the
load
cut
against
the
beam
and
in
the
background
he
saw
a
shower
of
leaping
sparks
but
the
other
light
was
growing
and
lister
turned
the
wheel
burning
oil
splashed
around
him
a
pillar
of
fire
rushed
up
and
when
a
whistle
screamed
he
let
go
the
valve
and
turned
from
the
blinding
dust
he
was
shaking
but
the
heavy
snorting
stopped
the
engineer
had
seen
the
light
and
cut
off
steam
when
lister
looked
round
the
train
was
gone
he
had
done
what
he
had
undertaken
and
after
waiting
for
a
few
moments
he
started
back
now
he
could
go
cautiously
he
stopped
and
tried
to
brace
himself
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
although
he
had
run
across
not
long
since
he
shrank
from
the
dark
forbidding
gaps
for
all
that
he
must
get
back
and
feeling
carefully
for
the
ties
he
reached
the
other
side
and
was
for
some
time
engaged
at
the
muskeg
where
two
cars
had
overrun
the
broken
rails
at
length
he
went
to
the
log
shack
he
used
for
his
office
and
and
soon
after
he
lighted
his
pipe
kemp
came
in
you
made
it
kemp
remarked
when
you
stopped
me
at
the
bridge
i
saw
you
get
there
lister
laughed
now
you
talk
about
it
i
believe
i
did
shout
you
to
go
back
anyhow
you
were
some
way
behind
did
willis
come
he
did
not
willis
was
badly
rattled
and
started
for
the
muskeg
thought
he
might
get
the
track
thrown
across
the
hole
perhaps
rather
sorry
for
the
kid
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
report
we
had
two
cars
bogged
and
state
the
cost
of
labor
that
all
i
think
kemp
nodded
well
perhaps
there
no
use
in
talking
about
the
lamp
our
business
is
to
make
good
using
the
tools
we
got
all
the
same
if
they
want
a
man
somewhere
else
i
guess
i
recommend
willis
he
smoked
quietly
for
a
time
and
then
resumed
we
do
get
forward
much
in
fact
if
the
new
western
irrigation
company
would
take
me
on
i
think
i
quit
lister
pondered
since
his
short
stop
at
winnipeg
he
had
been
conscious
of
a
strange
restlessness
he
wanted
something
the
woods
could
not
give
and
had
begun
to
think
life
had
more
to
offer
than
he
had
known
besides
he
was
not
making
much
progress
since
the
double
track
is
to
be
pushed
on
across
the
plains
the
department
will
need
a
bigger
staff
and
there
ought
to
be
a
chance
for
some
of
us
he
said
then
there
the
new
work
with
the
long
bridges
on
the
lake
section
that
will
carry
higher
pay
we
next
on
turn
and
have
some
claim
they
ought
to
move
us
up
i
doubt
we
did
come
from
a
famous
office
and
it
not
always
enough
to
know
your
job
somebody
will
get
a
better
post
and
if
i
lucky
i
stay
if
not
i
think
i
try
the
irrigation
works
i
feel
like
that
kemp
declared
but
suppose
the
irrigation
people
turn
our
application
down
then
i
lie
off
for
a
time
except
when
i
went
to
mcgill
with
money
i
earned
on
a
wheat
barge
i
have
stopped
work
since
i
was
a
boy
now
i
getting
tired
and
think
i
pull
out
and
go
across
to
look
at
the
old
country
my
father
was
an
englishman
and
i
have
some
money
to
burn
a
good
plan
kemp
agreed
after
a
change
you
come
back
fresh
with
a
stronger
punch
well
if
we
not
put
on
to
the
lake
section
we
try
the
irrigation
scheme
he
got
up
and
went
off
but
lister
sat
on
his
bunk
and
smoked
the
bunk
was
packed
with
on
which
his
coarse
hudson
bay
blankets
were
laid
and
the
shack
was
bare
ragged
slickers
and
old
overalls
occupied
the
wall
long
a
corner
a
big
box
carried
an
iron
and
a
small
table
some
drawing
instruments
lister
was
not
fastidious
and
as
a
rule
did
not
stop
long
enough
at
one
spot
to
justify
his
making
his
shack
comfortable
besides
he
found
it
necessary
to
concentrate
on
his
work
and
had
not
much
time
to
think
about
refinements
all
the
same
he
felt
the
shack
was
dreary
and
his
life
was
bleak
he
had
not
felt
this
until
he
went
to
winnipeg
on
the
whole
he
had
liked
the
struggle
against
physical
obstacles
it
was
his
proper
job
but
the
struggle
was
stern
and
sometimes
exhausting
and
his
reward
was
small
now
he
wanted
something
different
and
gave
himself
to
vague
and
brooding
discontent
ruth
duveen
had
broken
his
former
tranquillity
in
a
sense
she
had
awakened
him
and
he
imagined
she
had
meant
to
do
so
all
the
same
to
think
she
loved
him
was
ridiculous
she
was
rather
experimenting
with
fresh
material
yet
she
was
accountable
for
his
discontent
she
had
helped
him
to
see
that
while
he
labored
in
the
woods
he
had
missed
much
he
wanted
the
society
of
cultivated
women
and
men
with
power
and
influence
to
use
control
instead
of
carrying
out
orders
and
to
know
something
of
refinement
and
beauty
after
all
his
father
was
a
cultivated
englishman
although
lister
imagined
he
had
inherited
qualities
that
helped
him
most
from
his
canadian
mother
it
was
all
he
had
inherited
except
some
debts
he
had
laboriously
paid
he
admitted
that
to
realize
his
ambitions
might
be
hard
but
he
meant
to
try
canada
was
for
the
young
and
stubborn
if
his
chiefs
did
not
promote
him
he
would
make
a
plunge
and
if
his
new
plan
did
not
work
he
would
go
over
and
see
the
old
country
then
he
would
come
back
braced
and
refreshed
and
try
his
luck
again
putting
down
his
pipe
he
got
into
bed
he
was
tired
and
in
the
morning
the
gravel
cars
must
be
pulled
out
of
the
muskeg
the
job
was
awkward
and
while
he
thought
about
it
he
went
to
sleep
chapter
viii
the
test
a
boisterous
wind
swept
the
high
plain
and
round
clouds
rolled
across
the
sky
the
grass
that
ran
back
from
the
horizon
was
parched
and
in
the
distance
a
white
streak
of
blowing
dust
marked
a
dried
alkali
lake
dust
of
dark
color
drove
along
the
row
of
wooden
stores
and
houses
that
fronted
the
railroad
track
across
which
three
grain
elevators
rose
like
castles
the
telegraph
posts
along
the
track
melted
into
the
level
waste
and
behind
the
spot
where
they
vanished
the
tops
of
a
larger
group
of
elevators
cut
the
edge
of
the
plain
the
street
was
not
paved
and
the
soil
was
deeply
ploughed
by
wheels
the
soil
was
the
black
gumbo
in
which
the
wheat
plant
thrives
but
the
town
occupied
the
fringe
of
a
dry
belt
and
farming
had
not
made
much
progress
now
however
a
company
was
going
to
irrigate
the
land
with
water
from
a
river
fed
by
the
rockies
snow
the
town
was
square
and
although
it
looked
much
smaller
than
agents
maps
indicated
it
was
ornamented
by
four
wooden
churches
a
like
a
temple
and
an
ambitious
public
hall
the
tecumseh
hotel
occupied
a
corner
lot
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
was
not
remarkably
commodious
or
clean
but
its
charges
were
less
than
the
occidental
by
the
station
and
lister
and
kemp
were
not
fastidious
some
time
had
gone
since
they
pulled
the
gravel
cars
out
of
the
swamp
and
they
had
not
been
sent
to
the
lake
section
in
consequence
they
had
applied
to
the
irrigation
company
for
a
post
and
having
been
called
to
meet
the
engineers
and
directors
imagined
they
were
on
the
short
list
lister
lounged
against
the
rails
on
the
tecumseh
veranda
the
boards
were
cracked
and
dirty
burned
matches
and
cigar
ends
were
scattered
about
and
a
skeleton
gauze
covered
door
that
shut
with
a
powerful
spring
kept
some
of
the
flies
and
mosquitoes
out
of
the
hotel
we
know
he
remarked
presently
kemp
nodded
i
ca
figure
on
our
chances
feel
anxious
about
it
not
much
in
fact
i
mean
to
use
the
thing
to
test
my
luck
if
engaged
i
stay
in
canada
if
they
turn
us
down
i
start
for
the
old
country
you
have
no
particular
plans
i
reckon
no
said
lister
smiling
i
going
to
look
about
i
know
our
new
western
towns
but
i
want
to
see
old
cities
churches
and
cathedrals
the
great
jobs
men
made
before
they
used
concrete
and
steel
then
like
to
study
art
and
music
and
see
the
people
my
father
talked
about
ours
is
a
good
country
but
when
it
all
you
know
it
gets
monotonous
he
indicated
the
row
of
wooden
houses
and
lonely
plain
one
wants
more
than
the
track
and
this
it
possible
you
may
go
across
said
kemp
looks
as
if
the
short
list
was
pretty
long
there
a
gang
of
candidates
in
town
we
have
no
pull
on
the
directors
and
i
do
know
if
our
advantages
are
very
marked
he
stopped
and
laughed
for
a
man
came
round
the
corner
hello
willis
he
exclaimed
when
did
you
arrive
i
came
in
on
the
last
train
got
a
notice
to
meet
the
irrigation
board
oh
well
said
kemp
since
the
applicants
are
more
numerous
than
the
posts
i
reckon
another
wo
count
do
you
expect
they
going
to
take
you
on
i
expect
my
chance
is
as
good
as
yours
i
sell
you
my
chance
for
ten
dollars
kemp
rejoined
nothing
doing
at
the
price
said
willis
and
went
off
kemp
laughed
willis
was
marked
by
a
superficial
smartness
his
comrades
sometimes
found
amusing
and
sometimes
annoying
for
the
most
part
they
bore
with
him
but
did
not
trust
him
when
work
that
needed
careful
thought
was
done
the
kid
looks
confident
but
his
applying
for
a
job
is
something
of
a
joke
kemp
remarked
i
put
his
value
at
fifty
cents
a
day
lister
agreed
and
looked
up
the
dusty
street
the
fronts
of
the
small
frame
houses
were
cracked
by
the
sun
and
some
were
carried
up
to
hide
the
roof
and
give
the
building
a
fictitious
height
a
wagon
stood
in
front
of
a
store
the
wheels
crusted
by
dry
mud
and
the
team
fidgeted
amidst
a
swarm
of
flies
except
for
one
or
two
railroad
hands
waiting
by
the
caboose
of
a
freight
train
nobody
was
about
the
town
looked
strangely
dreary
yet
lister
knew
it
stood
for
all
the
relief
from
labor
in
the
stinging
alkali
dust
one
could
get
one
could
loaf
in
a
hard
chair
in
front
of
the
hotel
lose
a
dollar
or
two
at
the
shabby
or
go
to
a
movie
show
and
see
pictures
of
frankly
ridiculous
western
melodrama
in
the
real
west
the
pictures
were
ridiculous
because
romantic
did
not
happen
in
fact
unless
a
stubborn
labor
dispute
began
nothing
broke
the
dull
monotony
of
toilsome
effort
romance
had
vanished
with
the
buffaloes
lister
admitted
that
he
had
not
long
felt
the
monotony
the
trouble
began
when
he
stopped
at
winnipeg
i
think
i
go
up
the
street
he
said
a
rough
plank
sidewalk
ran
in
front
of
the
houses
and
lister
imagined
it
was
needed
when
the
spring
thaw
and
summer
softened
the
gumbo
soil
opposite
the
occidental
he
stopped
for
duveen
occupied
a
chair
on
the
veranda
while
lister
hesitated
duveen
beckoned
him
to
come
up
it
hot
and
dusty
will
you
take
a
drink
he
said
lister
refused
with
thanks
and
wondered
whether
ruth
was
at
the
hotel
in
a
way
he
would
like
to
see
her
but
admitted
that
perhaps
he
had
better
not
when
he
asked
if
she
was
well
duveen
said
she
had
gone
to
quebec
and
gave
lister
a
cigar
it
looks
as
if
you
had
left
the
railroad
he
remarked
i
have
not
left
yet
said
lister
cautiously
then
you
wo
go
unless
you
get
a
better
job
did
you
know
i
had
joined
the
irrigation
board
lister
said
he
did
not
know
and
got
embarrassed
when
duveen
gave
him
a
thoughtful
glance
he
wondered
whether
ruth
had
talked
to
duveen
before
she
hinted
he
might
get
a
better
post
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
come
up
in
fact
i
hesitated
duveen
laughed
so
i
remarked
you
reckoned
the
occidental
stoop
was
pretty
public
and
your
talking
to
me
might
imply
that
you
wanted
my
support
well
i
risk
that
it
obvious
you
on
the
short
list
do
you
want
a
post
for
a
moment
or
two
lister
pondered
he
did
want
a
post
anyhow
he
ought
to
try
for
it
on
the
whole
he
liked
duveen
and
thought
he
might
have
liked
ruth
better
had
she
not
been
rich
all
the
same
duveen
was
a
shrewd
manipulator
of
new
industries
and
to
take
a
post
by
his
favor
would
be
to
own
a
debt
for
which
payment
might
be
demanded
yet
duveen
had
been
kind
and
lister
hesitated
i
asked
for
a
post
he
said
if
i
engaged
i
try
to
make
good
but
i
must
make
good
at
the
dam
or
on
the
ditch
then
i
do
want
to
bother
my
friends
the
company
has
my
engineering
record
and
must
judge
my
usefulness
by
this
if
they
not
satisfied
i
wo
grumble
much
you
an
independent
fellow
but
i
think
i
understand
duveen
rejoined
with
a
twinkle
a
company
director
duty
to
judge
an
applicant
for
a
post
by
his
professional
record
if
you
are
appointed
you
want
us
to
appoint
you
because
we
believe
you
are
the
proper
man
something
like
that
said
lister
quietly
duveen
nodded
and
his
glance
rested
for
a
moment
on
lister
forehead
i
see
the
mark
you
got
on
board
the
train
has
altogether
gone
did
you
hear
anything
about
the
girl
you
helped
i
did
not
said
lister
starting
for
he
had
not
imagined
duveen
knew
about
the
girl
i
have
not
seen
her
since
she
went
off
on
the
locomotive
then
she
has
not
written
to
you
since
she
could
not
write
because
she
does
know
who
i
am
and
i
know
her
we
talked
for
a
minute
or
two
that
all
duveen
face
was
inscrutable
and
lister
wondered
whether
he
doubted
his
statement
he
was
annoyed
because
the
other
knew
so
much
oh
well
said
duveen
i
expect
you
heard
they
did
catch
shillito
and
since
he
got
across
the
frontier
it
possible
the
canadian
police
wo
see
him
again
but
i
must
get
ready
for
supper
will
you
stay
lister
excused
himself
and
went
back
to
the
tecumseh
where
the
bill
of
fare
was
frugal
and
the
serving
rude
he
imagined
he
had
refused
much
more
than
a
supper
but
was
satisfied
he
had
taken
the
proper
line
for
one
thing
duveen
knew
ruth
had
given
him
her
friendship
and
since
he
knew
his
daughter
it
was
significant
that
he
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
meddle
lister
wondered
whether
he
had
meant
to
use
him
and
was
glad
he
had
kept
his
independence
if
he
got
the
post
now
he
would
know
he
had
rather
misjudged
duveen
but
he
doubted
all
the
same
he
liked
the
man
after
supper
kemp
and
he
sat
on
the
veranda
and
watched
the
green
glow
fade
from
the
edge
of
the
plain
they
did
not
talk
much
but
by
and
by
kemp
remarked
i
thought
i
saw
you
go
into
the
occidental
duveen
called
me
on
to
the
stoop
duveen
kemp
exclaimed
then
he
got
his
hand
on
the
wires
if
the
irrigation
company
puts
the
undertaking
over
a
number
of
the
dollars
will
go
to
duveen
wad
if
he
your
friend
i
expect
you
know
he
could
get
you
the
job
it
possible
all
the
same
i
hinted
i
did
want
his
help
kemp
laughed
you
surprise
me
every
time
i
all
for
a
square
deal
and
down
with
scheming
grafters
and
but
i
allow
i
hate
them
worst
when
they
give
another
fellow
the
post
i
want
the
thing
not
fixed
yet
the
company
engineers
are
going
to
judge
and
our
record
pretty
good
they
may
engage
us
we
know
sure
thing
kemp
remarked
dryly
i
reckon
we
both
pull
out
on
the
first
train
it
began
to
get
dark
and
lister
went
off
to
bed
he
must
get
water
from
a
cistern
in
the
roof
and
to
carry
the
heavy
jug
was
awkward
when
one
could
not
see
at
the
tecumseh
the
guests
were
expected
to
carry
water
for
themselves
and
lister
groping
along
the
shadowy
passage
with
his
load
thought
his
doing
so
had
some
significance
it
was
part
of
the
price
he
must
pay
for
freedom
at
the
time
fixed
in
the
morning
he
went
to
the
occidental
and
was
shown
into
a
room
where
a
number
of
gentlemen
occupied
a
table
one
or
two
were
smoking
and
the
others
talked
in
low
voices
but
when
lister
came
in
and
the
secretary
indicated
a
chair
they
turned
as
if
to
study
him
duveen
sat
next
a
man
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
gave
lister
a
nod
somehow
lister
thought
he
was
amused
lister
heart
beat
he
felt
this
was
ridiculous
because
he
had
persuaded
himself
it
did
not
matter
whether
he
got
the
post
or
not
now
however
when
the
moment
to
try
his
luck
had
come
he
shrank
from
the
plunge
he
had
resolved
to
make
if
he
were
not
engaged
after
all
he
knew
and
liked
his
occupation
to
let
it
go
and
try
fresh
fields
would
be
something
of
a
wrench
the
gentlemen
did
not
embarrass
him
on
the
whole
they
were
urbane
and
when
the
secretary
gave
the
chairman
his
application
one
asked
a
few
questions
about
the
work
he
had
done
lister
was
able
to
answer
satisfactorily
and
another
talked
to
him
about
the
obstacles
encountered
when
one
excavated
treacherous
gravel
and
built
a
bank
to
stand
angry
floods
for
all
that
lister
was
anxious
the
others
looked
bored
as
if
they
were
politely
playing
a
game
he
thought
they
knew
beforehand
how
the
game
would
end
but
he
did
not
know
the
inquiries
that
bored
the
urbane
gentlemen
had
important
consequences
for
him
and
the
suspense
was
keen
at
length
they
let
him
go
and
duveen
gave
him
a
smile
that
lister
thought
implied
much
when
he
returned
to
the
hotel
kemp
remarked
that
he
looked
as
if
he
needed
a
drink
and
suggested
that
lister
go
with
him
and
get
one
i
need
three
or
four
drinks
but
mean
to
go
without
said
lister
grimly
i
begin
to
understand
how
some
men
get
the
tanking
habit
he
started
off
across
the
plain
and
coming
back
too
late
for
lunch
found
kemp
on
the
veranda
kemp
looked
as
if
he
were
trying
to
be
philosophical
but
found
it
hard
the
secretary
arrived
not
long
since
he
said
a
polite
man
he
did
want
to
let
us
down
too
heavily
ah
said
lister
the
irrigation
people
have
no
use
for
us
kemp
nodded
willis
has
got
the
best
job
they
hired
up
two
or
three
others
but
we
left
out
willis
exclaimed
lister
and
joined
in
kemp
laugh
after
all
the
money
he
going
to
get
is
theirs
said
kemp
in
this
country
we
a
curious
lot
we
let
grafters
and
run
us
and
when
we
start
a
big
job
get
away
with
much
of
the
capital
we
want
for
machines
but
somehow
we
make
good
we
shoulder
a
load
we
carry
and
hit
the
pace
up
hot
if
we
got
clean
control
i
reckon
never
stop
however
there
not
much
use
in
philosophizing
when
lost
your
job
and
the
train
goes
out
in
a
few
minutes
better
pack
your
grip
chapter
ix
barbara
plays
a
part
lister
returned
to
the
railroad
camp
and
stayed
until
the
company
sent
a
man
to
fill
his
post
in
the
meantime
he
wrote
to
some
of
his
relations
whom
he
had
not
seen
and
their
reply
was
kind
they
stated
that
while
he
was
in
england
he
must
make
their
house
his
home
when
his
successor
arrived
he
started
for
montreal
and
one
afternoon
sat
under
a
tree
in
the
square
by
the
cathedral
the
afternoon
was
calm
a
thunderstorm
that
wet
the
streets
had
gone
and
an
enervating
damp
heat
brooded
over
the
city
after
the
fresh
winds
that
sweep
the
woods
and
plains
lister
felt
the
languid
air
made
him
slack
and
dull
his
steamer
did
not
sail
until
daybreak
and
since
he
had
gone
up
the
mountain
and
seen
the
cathedral
and
notre
dame
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
the
bench
he
occupied
was
in
the
shade
and
he
smoked
and
looked
about
cabs
rolled
up
the
street
to
the
big
hotel
across
the
square
and
behind
the
trees
the
huge
block
of
the
station
cut
the
sky
one
heard
whistles
the
rumble
of
heavy
wheels
and
the
tolling
of
locomotive
bells
pigeons
flew
down
from
the
cathedral
dome
and
searched
the
damp
gravel
a
group
of
foreign
emigrants
picnicked
in
the
shade
their
clothes
were
old
and
greasy
they
carried
big
shapeless
bundles
and
looked
tired
and
worn
lister
could
not
guess
their
nationality
but
imagined
they
had
known
poverty
and
oppression
in
eastern
europe
it
was
obvious
they
had
recently
disembarked
from
a
crowded
steerage
and
waited
for
an
emigrant
train
they
were
going
west
to
the
land
of
promise
and
lister
wished
them
luck
he
and
they
were
birds
of
passage
and
with
all
old
landmarks
left
behind
rested
for
a
few
hours
on
their
journey
he
studied
the
group
the
men
looked
dull
and
beaten
the
women
had
no
beauty
and
had
grown
coarse
with
toil
their
faces
were
pinched
and
their
shoulders
bent
only
the
children
in
spite
of
rags
and
dirt
struck
a
hopeful
note
yet
the
forlorn
strangers
had
pluck
they
had
made
a
great
adventure
and
might
get
their
reward
lister
had
seen
others
in
the
west
who
had
made
good
breaking
soil
they
owned
and
walking
with
the
confident
step
of
men
on
the
plains
stubborn
labor
was
rewarded
but
one
needed
pluck
to
leave
all
one
knew
and
break
custom
familiar
but
heavy
yoke
by
and
by
lister
remembered
he
wanted
to
take
his
relations
a
few
typically
canadian
presents
he
had
seen
nothing
that
satisfied
him
at
winnipeg
and
had
better
look
about
the
shops
at
montreal
anyhow
it
would
amuse
him
for
an
hour
or
two
he
got
up
went
along
the
path
for
a
few
yards
and
then
stopped
across
the
clanging
of
the
locomotive
bells
and
the
roll
of
trolley
cars
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
he
heard
sweet
voices
the
music
was
faint
and
somehow
ethereal
as
if
it
fell
from
a
height
one
lost
it
now
and
then
it
came
from
the
cathedral
and
lister
stopped
and
listened
he
did
not
know
what
office
was
being
sung
but
the
jaded
emigrants
knew
for
a
child
got
up
and
stood
with
bent
head
holding
a
greasy
cap
and
a
ragged
woman
face
got
gentle
as
she
signed
herself
with
the
cross
it
looked
as
if
the
birds
of
passage
had
found
a
landmark
in
a
foreign
land
lister
was
moved
and
gave
the
child
a
coin
before
he
went
off
he
strolled
east
past
notre
dame
towards
the
post
office
about
which
the
stately
banks
and
imposing
office
blocks
stand
this
quarter
of
the
city
drew
him
for
one
saw
how
constructive
talent
and
imagination
could
be
used
and
he
wondered
whether
england
had
new
buildings
like
these
sometimes
one
felt
the
western
towns
were
raw
and
vulgar
but
one
saw
the
bold
canadian
genius
at
its
best
in
montreal
after
a
time
he
stopped
in
front
of
a
shop
in
a
short
side
street
indian
embroidery
work
and
enameled
silver
occupied
the
window
and
although
lister
was
not
an
artist
he
had
an
eye
for
line
and
knew
the
things
were
good
the
soft
stained
deerskin
was
cleverly
embroidered
he
liked
the
warm
colors
of
the
enamel
and
going
in
was
shown
a
tray
of
spoons
the
shop
shut
in
by
high
buildings
was
dark
and
smelt
of
aromatic
wood
and
leather
but
a
beam
from
a
window
pierced
the
gloom
and
sparkled
on
the
silver
this
was
emblazoned
with
the
arms
of
the
provinces
the
ship
the
wheatsheaves
and
the
red
maple
leaf
lister
picked
up
the
articles
and
while
he
did
so
was
vaguely
conscious
that
a
girl
at
the
opposite
counter
studied
him
he
however
did
not
look
up
until
he
had
selected
a
few
of
the
spoons
and
then
he
started
the
light
that
touched
the
girl
face
did
not
illuminate
it
all
her
profile
was
sharp
as
an
old
daguerreotype
he
saw
the
flowing
line
from
brow
to
chin
drawn
with
something
of
austere
classic
beauty
the
arched
lips
and
the
faint
indication
of
a
cheek
the
rest
was
in
shadow
and
the
contrast
of
light
and
gloom
was
like
a
rembrandt
picture
then
the
enameled
spoons
rattled
as
lister
put
down
the
tray
he
knew
the
picture
when
he
last
saw
the
girl
her
face
was
lighted
like
that
by
the
blaze
of
a
locomotive
i
take
these
things
he
said
and
crossed
the
floor
the
girl
moved
back
but
he
indicated
a
bundle
of
deerskin
articles
he
thought
her
business
was
to
sell
her
color
was
high
he
noted
the
vivid
white
and
pink
against
the
dull
background
of
stained
leather
what
does
one
do
with
those
bags
he
asked
they
useful
for
keeping
gloves
and
handkerchiefs
she
replied
the
pattern
is
worked
in
sinews
but
we
have
some
with
a
neat
colored
embroidery
she
paused
and
signed
to
a
saleswoman
farther
on
will
you
bring
this
gentleman
the
revillon
goods
lister
object
for
stopping
her
was
not
very
plain
but
he
did
not
mean
to
let
her
go
please
do
bother
i
expect
to
find
something
in
this
bundle
he
said
to
the
approaching
saleswoman
then
he
turned
to
the
girl
in
front
let
me
look
at
the
bag
with
the
pattern
she
gave
him
the
bag
and
although
her
glance
was
steady
he
knew
she
was
embarrassed
if
you
will
wrap
it
up
i
keep
this
one
he
resumed
i
expect
you
have
not
forgotten
me
when
i
came
into
the
shop
i
did
imagine
i
should
meet
you
but
if
you
sooner
i
went
off
i
go
i
have
not
forgotten
she
admitted
and
her
color
faded
and
came
back
to
her
delicate
skin
very
well
since
i
sail
on
the
allan
boat
it
plain
you
need
be
afraid
of
my
bothering
you
all
the
same
we
were
partners
in
an
adventure
that
ought
to
make
us
friends
ca
i
meet
you
for
a
few
minutes
when
you
stop
work
she
hesitated
and
then
gave
him
a
searching
glance
come
to
the
fountain
up
the
street
in
an
hour
this
is
my
early
evening
lister
went
off
with
the
bag
and
spoons
and
when
he
returned
to
the
fountain
saw
her
crossing
the
square
in
front
she
was
dressed
like
the
he
had
seen
hurrying
on
board
the
street
cars
in
the
morning
her
clothes
were
pretty
and
fashionable
but
lister
thought
the
material
was
cheap
he
felt
she
ought
not
to
wear
things
like
that
while
she
advanced
he
studied
her
she
was
attractive
in
a
way
he
had
hardly
remarked
on
board
the
train
one
rather
noted
her
quick
resolute
movements
the
sparkle
in
her
eyes
and
her
keen
vitality
lister
began
to
think
he
had
unconsciously
noted
much
i
going
to
take
you
to
supper
and
you
can
send
me
off
when
you
like
afterwards
he
said
and
started
across
the
square
a
famous
restaurant
was
not
far
off
no
she
said
as
if
she
knew
where
he
was
going
if
i
go
with
you
it
must
be
the
i
and
my
friends
use
she
gave
him
a
rather
hard
smile
and
added
there
no
use
in
my
going
where
i
do
belong
lister
said
nothing
but
while
they
walked
across
the
town
she
talked
with
a
brightness
he
thought
forced
and
when
they
stopped
at
a
small
in
a
side
street
he
frowned
he
was
persuaded
she
did
not
belong
there
she
was
playing
a
part
perhaps
not
very
cleverly
since
he
had
found
her
out
she
wanted
him
to
think
her
a
enjoying
an
evening
adventure
her
talk
and
careless
laugh
hinted
at
this
but
lister
was
not
cheated
they
went
in
the
room
was
small
and
its
ornamentation
unusual
imitation
vines
crawled
about
light
wooden
arches
cutting
up
the
floor
space
into
quiet
corners
the
room
was
rather
dark
but
pink
lamps
shone
among
the
leaves
and
the
soft
light
touched
the
tables
and
clusters
of
artificial
grapes
lister
thought
the
plan
was
well
carried
out
for
the
grapes
were
the
small
red
muskokas
that
grow
in
canada
when
he
picked
up
the
menu
card
he
understood
why
girls
from
the
stores
and
offices
used
the
place
lister
ordered
the
best
supper
the
landlady
could
serve
and
then
began
to
talk
while
he
helped
his
companion
the
corner
they
occupied
was
secluded
and
he
owned
that
to
sup
with
an
attractive
girl
had
a
romantic
charm
he
noted
that
she
frankly
enjoyed
the
food
and
he
liked
her
light
quick
laugh
and
the
sparkle
in
her
eyes
her
thin
summer
clothes
hinted
at
a
slender
form
and
her
careless
pose
was
graceful
he
wondered
whether
she
felt
her
meeting
him
was
something
of
an
adventure
but
he
was
persuaded
she
was
playing
a
part
her
frankness
was
not
bold
the
little
gestures
were
obviously
borrowed
and
some
of
the
colloquialisms
she
used
were
out
of
date
except
for
these
her
talk
was
cultivated
for
a
time
lister
tried
to
play
up
and
then
resolved
to
see
if
he
could
break
her
reserve
it
looks
as
if
you
made
malcolm
all
right
on
board
the
gravel
train
he
remarked
she
gave
him
a
quick
glance
and
colored
yes
i
made
it
and
got
the
express
the
engineer
was
kind
i
expect
you
told
him
he
must
help
when
i
put
you
on
board
the
locomotive
i
knew
roberts
would
see
you
out
he
a
sober
fellow
and
has
two
girls
as
old
as
you
you
do
know
how
old
i
am
she
said
with
an
effort
for
carelessness
anyhow
it
plain
you
are
young
enough
to
be
rash
lister
rejoined
she
put
down
her
cup
and
her
glance
was
soft
he
saw
she
was
not
acting
i
do
think
i
really
was
rash
not
it
something
to
know
when
you
can
trust
people
and
i
did
know
lister
was
embarrassed
but
her
gentleness
had
charm
he
did
not
want
her
to
resume
her
other
manner
then
he
was
tempted
to
make
an
experiment
you
know
shillito
got
away
her
lips
trembled
and
the
blood
came
to
her
skin
but
she
fronted
him
bravely
and
he
felt
ashamed
yes
she
said
i
think
i
would
sooner
he
had
been
caught
but
why
did
you
begin
to
talk
about
shillito
perhaps
i
ought
i
sorry
she
studied
him
and
he
thought
she
pondered
although
it
was
possible
she
wanted
to
recover
her
calm
unless
you
are
very
dull
you
know
something
she
resumed
with
an
effort
well
i
was
rash
but
just
before
i
saw
you
on
the
platform
i
found
out
all
i
risked
i
think
i
was
desperate
i
meant
to
jump
off
the
train
only
it
was
going
fast
and
water
shone
under
the
bridge
then
you
pushed
me
from
the
step
and
i
felt
i
must
make
another
plunge
and
try
to
get
your
help
now
i
glad
i
did
so
but
that
all
lister
understood
that
the
thing
was
done
with
she
would
tell
him
nothing
more
and
he
was
sorry
he
had
indulged
his
curiosity
oh
well
he
said
there
not
much
risk
of
my
bothering
you
about
the
fellow
again
i
start
for
england
in
a
few
hours
her
glance
got
wistful
she
moved
her
plate
and
her
hand
trembled
you
are
english
he
resumed
i
met
you
first
on
board
a
canadian
train
and
now
you
find
me
helping
at
a
montreal
store
is
this
enough
why
do
you
try
to
find
out
where
i
come
from
i
sorry
all
the
same
you
not
a
canadian
i
am
a
canadian
now
she
rejoined
and
then
added
as
if
she
were
resolved
to
talk
about
something
else
there
a
mark
on
your
forehead
like
a
deep
cut
you
had
got
it
when
i
saw
you
on
the
platform
no
said
lister
i
fell
down
some
steps
not
long
afterwards
she
looked
at
him
sharply
and
then
exclaimed
oh
the
newspapers
said
there
was
a
struggle
on
the
train
somebody
helped
the
police
and
got
hurt
it
was
you
shillito
knew
you
had
meddled
you
got
the
cut
for
me
we
agreed
we
would
talk
about
shillito
i
got
the
cut
because
i
did
want
to
see
a
young
police
trooper
knocked
out
people
who
meddle
do
get
hurt
now
and
then
anyhow
it
some
time
since
and
i
think
let
it
go
suppose
you
tell
me
about
montreal
and
your
job
at
the
store
she
roused
herself
and
began
to
talk
lister
thought
it
cost
her
something
but
she
sketched
her
working
companions
with
skill
and
humor
she
used
their
accent
and
their
gestures
lister
laughed
and
led
her
on
although
he
got
a
hint
of
strain
the
girl
was
not
happy
and
he
had
noted
her
wistful
look
when
she
talked
about
england
at
length
she
got
up
and
stopping
at
the
door
for
a
moment
gave
him
her
hand
thank
you
i
wish
you
she
said
ca
we
go
somewhere
else
is
there
nothing
doing
at
the
theaters
lister
asked
no
she
said
resolutely
i
going
home
anyhow
i
going
where
i
live
lister
let
her
go
but
waited
watching
her
while
she
went
up
the
street
somehow
she
looked
forlorn
and
he
felt
pitiful
he
remembered
that
he
did
not
know
her
name
which
he
had
wanted
to
ask
but
durst
not
when
he
returned
to
his
hotel
he
stopped
at
the
desk
and
gave
the
clerk
a
cigarette
as
a
rule
a
canadian
hotel
clerk
knows
something
about
everybody
of
importance
in
the
town
i
bought
some
at
a
curiosity
depot
he
said
and
told
the
other
where
the
shop
was
although
they
charged
me
pretty
high
the
things
looked
good
you
have
got
stung
the
clerk
remarked
the
folks
are
but
they
like
a
square
deal
if
you
put
up
the
money
they
put
up
the
goods
the
shop
hands
looked
smart
and
bright
if
you
study
the
sales
people
you
can
sometimes
tell
how
a
store
is
run
that
so
those
girls
do
want
to
grumble
they
treated
all
right
oh
well
said
lister
since
i
do
know
much
about
enameled
goods
and
deerskin
truck
i
glad
i
not
got
stung
when
he
went
off
the
other
smiled
for
a
hotel
clerk
is
not
often
cheated
and
he
thought
he
saw
where
lister
remarks
led
lister
however
was
strangely
satisfied
it
was
something
to
know
the
storekeepers
were
honest
and
kind
to
the
people
they
employed
chapter
x
vernon
curiosity
silky
blue
lines
streaked
the
long
undulations
that
ran
back
to
the
horizon
and
the
rolled
with
a
measured
swing
when
her
bows
went
down
the
shining
swell
broke
with
a
dull
roar
and
rainbows
flickered
in
the
spray
about
her
forecastle
then
while
the
long
deck
got
level
one
heard
the
beat
of
engines
and
the
grinding
of
screws
a
wake
like
an
angry
torrent
foamed
astern
and
in
the
distance
where
the
dingy
melted
the
crags
of
labrador
ran
in
faint
broken
line
ahead
an
glittered
in
the
sun
the
liner
had
left
belle
isle
strait
and
was
steaming
towards
greenland
on
the
northern
atlantic
course
harry
vernon
occupied
a
chair
on
the
and
read
the
which
had
been
sent
on
board
at
rimouski
the
light
reflected
by
the
white
boats
and
deck
was
strong
he
was
not
much
interested
and
put
down
the
newspaper
when
lister
joined
him
they
had
met
on
the
journey
from
winnipeg
to
montreal
and
on
boarding
the
lister
was
given
the
second
berth
in
vernon
room
vernon
liked
lister
take
a
smoke
he
said
indicating
a
packet
of
cigarettes
nothing
fresh
in
the
newspapers
they
caught
the
fellow
porteous
he
was
trying
to
steal
across
to
detroit
lister
sat
down
and
lighted
a
cigarette
porteous
was
a
clerk
who
had
not
long
since
gone
off
with
a
large
sum
of
his
employer
money
canada
is
getting
a
popular
hunting
ground
for
smart
crooks
it
looks
as
if
our
business
men
were
easily
robbed
there
are
two
kinds
of
business
men
one
lot
makes
things
the
other
buys
and
sells
some
of
the
first
are
pretty
good
manufacturers
but
stop
at
that
they
concentrate
on
manufacturing
and
hire
a
specialist
to
look
after
finance
but
if
the
specialist
a
crook
ca
you
spot
him
when
he
gets
to
work
as
a
rule
the
men
who
get
stung
know
all
about
machines
and
material
but
nothing
about
vernon
replied
a
bright
accountant
could
rob
one
or
two
i
met
when
he
was
asleep
for
example
there
was
shillito
his
employers
were
big
and
prosperous
lumber
people
clever
men
at
their
job
but
shillito
gambled
with
their
money
for
some
time
before
they
got
on
his
track
i
expect
you
read
about
him
in
the
newspapers
lister
smiled
and
pushing
back
his
cap
touched
his
forehead
i
know
something
about
shillito
that
his
mark
then
you
were
the
man
he
knocked
out
vernon
exclaimed
but
he
got
your
money
why
did
you
help
the
police
it
is
very
obvious
somehow
i
did
like
the
fellow
then
you
see
the
girl
the
girl
what
had
a
girl
to
do
with
it
lister
frowned
he
had
not
meant
to
talk
about
the
girl
and
was
angry
because
he
had
done
so
but
did
not
see
how
he
could
withdraw
his
careless
statement
moreover
vernon
looked
interested
and
it
was
important
that
both
were
typical
canadians
the
young
canadian
is
not
subtle
as
a
rule
his
talk
is
direct
and
at
awkward
moments
he
is
generally
marked
by
a
frank
gravity
vernon
was
grave
now
and
lister
thought
he
pondered
he
had
not
known
vernon
long
but
he
felt
one
could
trust
him
i
met
a
girl
on
board
the
train
he
said
she
was
keen
about
getting
away
from
shillito
why
did
she
want
to
get
away
i
do
know
looked
as
if
she
was
afraid
of
him
when
i
first
saw
her
she
was
on
the
car
platform
and
i
reckoned
she
was
bracing
herself
to
jump
off
since
we
were
running
across
a
trestle
i
pulled
her
from
the
steps
that
how
the
thing
began
but
it
did
stop
just
then
it
stopped
soon
afterwards
lister
replied
she
wanted
to
get
off
and
go
east
the
train
was
bound
west
but
we
were
held
up
at
a
and
i
put
her
on
board
a
gravel
train
locomotive
then
she
went
east
said
vernon
thoughtfully
and
studied
the
other
lister
sat
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
the
sun
on
his
brown
face
his
look
was
calm
and
frank
his
careless
pose
brought
out
the
lines
of
his
thin
but
muscular
figure
vernon
felt
he
was
honest
he
knew
type
she
went
off
on
board
our
construction
locomotive
lister
replied
but
i
do
see
yet
why
did
you
meddle
why
did
she
give
you
her
confidence
she
did
give
me
her
confidence
lister
said
and
smiled
she
wanted
to
get
away
and
i
helped
that
all
it
obvious
i
was
out
for
a
romantic
adventure
because
i
put
her
off
the
train
vernon
nodded
lister
argument
was
sound
besides
he
did
not
look
like
a
philanderer
then
you
do
know
who
she
is
i
do
know
she
did
put
me
wise
and
my
business
was
not
to
bother
her
what
was
she
like
did
you
guess
her
age
how
was
she
dressed
lister
lighted
a
fresh
cigarette
vernon
keenness
rather
puzzled
him
but
he
thought
he
had
told
the
fellow
enough
in
fact
he
doubted
if
the
girl
would
approve
his
frankness
he
was
not
going
to
state
that
he
had
met
her
at
montreal
anyhow
not
yet
if
vernon
talked
about
the
thing
again
and
gave
proper
grounds
for
his
curiosity
he
might
perhaps
satisfy
him
she
was
young
he
answered
vaguely
attractive
something
of
a
looker
i
think
i
do
know
much
about
women
clothes
oh
well
said
vernon
you
helped
her
off
and
shillito
found
this
out
and
got
after
you
he
got
after
me
when
he
saw
he
was
corraled
lister
replied
and
narrated
his
struggle
on
the
platform
he
was
now
willing
to
tell
vernon
all
he
wanted
to
know
but
saw
the
other
interest
was
not
keen
and
they
presently
began
to
talk
about
something
else
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
the
old
country
vernon
asked
i
have
no
plans
for
a
time
i
guess
i
loaf
and
look
about
then
i
want
to
see
my
father
folks
whom
i
have
met
your
father
was
english
why
yes
said
lister
smiling
if
you
reckon
up
you
find
a
big
proportion
of
the
staunchest
canadians
parents
came
from
the
old
country
in
fact
i
sometimes
feel
canada
belongs
to
us
and
the
boys
of
the
sourdough
stock
between
us
we
have
given
the
country
its
stamp
and
made
it
a
land
for
white
men
but
we
soon
be
forced
to
make
good
our
claim
if
we
slack
we
be
snowed
under
by
folks
from
eastern
europe
whose
rules
and
habits
are
not
ours
vernon
nodded
it
a
problem
we
have
got
to
solve
but
are
you
going
back
to
the
railroad
when
you
have
looked
about
i
going
back
some
time
but
now
i
have
pulled
out
i
want
to
see
all
i
can
i
like
to
look
at
europe
egypt
and
india
wandering
around
costs
something
vernon
remarked
that
is
so
my
wad
small
but
if
i
not
had
enough
when
it
used
up
i
look
for
a
job
if
nothing
else
is
doing
i
go
to
sea
vernon
smile
was
sympathetic
and
he
looked
ahead
over
the
dipping
forecastle
to
the
far
horizon
the
sea
shone
with
reflected
light
and
an
iceberg
glimmered
against
the
blue
he
felt
the
measured
throb
of
engines
and
the
ship
leap
forward
vernon
was
a
young
canadian
and
sprang
from
pioneering
stock
the
vague
distance
called
he
felt
the
lure
of
going
somewhere
if
the
thing
was
possible
i
go
with
you
he
said
all
the
same
i
tied
to
business
and
the
old
man
ca
pull
his
load
alone
my
to
stick
to
the
traces
and
help
him
along
but
do
you
know
much
about
the
sea
i
was
engineer
on
board
a
pacific
coasting
boat
and
a
wheat
barge
on
the
lakes
well
said
vernon
thoughtfully
i
know
an
english
shipping
boss
who
might
help
you
get
a
berth
i
rather
like
you
to
meet
him
but
talk
about
this
again
now
let
join
those
fellows
at
their
friendship
ripened
but
it
was
not
until
the
last
day
of
the
voyage
vernon
said
something
more
about
the
english
was
steaming
across
the
irish
sea
with
the
high
blue
hills
of
mourne
astern
and
the
manx
rocks
ahead
vernon
lounged
on
the
and
his
face
was
thoughtful
as
he
looked
across
the
shining
water
we
make
liverpool
soon
after
dark
and
if
i
can
get
the
train
i
want
i
pull
out
right
then
he
said
you
allowed
you
might
try
a
run
on
board
an
english
ship
before
you
went
back
it
possible
said
lister
depends
on
how
my
wad
holds
out
and
on
somebody
being
willing
to
give
me
a
post
vernon
nodded
that
where
i
leading
he
stopped
and
lister
wondered
why
he
pondered
the
thing
did
not
seem
worth
the
thought
his
companion
gave
it
i
reckon
you
do
know
cartwright
of
the
independent
freighters
but
he
could
put
you
wise
about
getting
a
ship
vernon
resumed
stopping
for
a
week
or
two
at
his
country
house
the
freighters
are
small
boats
but
cartwright
worth
knowing
in
fact
to
know
him
is
something
of
an
education
in
the
west
we
pretty
keen
business
men
and
i
put
across
some
smart
deals
at
the
winnipeg
board
of
trade
but
i
admit
cartwright
would
beat
me
every
time
where
do
you
mean
to
locate
lister
said
he
was
going
to
the
neighborhood
of
a
small
country
town
in
the
north
of
england
and
was
puzzled
by
vernon
start
that
fixes
it
the
thing
strangely
lucky
cartwright
country
house
is
not
far
off
you
had
better
come
along
by
my
train
soon
after
i
arrive
i
get
cartwright
to
ask
you
across
i
must
bother
your
friends
said
lister
besides
i
really
know
if
i
want
to
go
to
sea
all
the
same
you
come
over
to
carrock
you
ought
to
know
cartwright
and
i
reckon
he
like
to
know
you
i
have
a
notion
you
and
he
would
make
a
good
team
lister
wondered
whether
vernon
had
an
object
for
urging
him
to
meet
his
friend
but
this
looked
ridiculous
what
cartwright
like
he
asked
carelessly
my
notion
is
cartwright
unique
you
imagine
he
something
of
a
highbrow
englishman
rather
formal
and
polite
but
he
has
an
eye
like
a
and
his
orders
go
hair
and
mustache
white
you
do
know
if
his
clothes
are
old
or
new
but
you
feel
they
exactly
what
he
ought
to
wear
that
cartwright
so
to
speak
on
top
but
when
you
meet
him
you
want
to
remember
you
not
up
against
a
canadian
we
a
straight
type
when
we
tough
we
very
tough
all
the
time
when
we
cultivated
you
can
see
the
polish
shine
in
the
old
country
harder
to
fix
where
folks
belong
you
imply
that
you
have
got
to
know
cartwright
before
you
fix
him
vernon
laughed
i
have
quite
fixed
him
yet
at
one
time
he
a
sober
gentleman
of
the
stiff
old
school
at
another
he
as
rough
as
the
roughest
hobo
i
met
in
the
west
i
reckon
he
beat
a
business
crook
at
the
other
smartest
trick
but
if
you
out
for
a
straight
deal
you
find
cartwright
straight
he
went
off
to
change
some
money
and
lister
went
to
his
cabin
and
began
to
pack
his
trunk
when
he
came
up
they
had
passed
the
chicken
rock
and
a
long
bright
beam
touched
the
sea
astern
in
the
east
water
and
sky
faded
to
dusky
blue
but
presently
a
faint
light
began
to
blink
as
if
it
beckoned
the
light
got
brighter
and
gradually
drew
abeam
the
foaming
wake
glimmered
lividly
in
the
dark
the
beat
of
screws
seemed
quicker
and
lister
thought
the
ship
was
carried
forward
by
a
stream
of
tide
other
lights
began
to
blink
they
stole
out
of
the
dark
got
bright
and
vanished
and
lister
leaning
on
the
rails
felt
they
called
him
on
one
knew
them
by
their
colors
and
measured
flashes
they
were
beacons
burning
on
a
plan
to
guide
the
navigator
but
he
did
not
know
the
plan
in
a
sense
this
was
important
and
he
began
to
muse
now
he
would
soon
reach
the
old
country
he
felt
he
had
made
a
momentous
plunge
adventure
called
he
knew
canada
and
wanted
something
fresh
but
he
wondered
whether
this
was
all
perhaps
the
plunge
had
so
to
speak
not
been
a
thoughtless
caprice
in
a
sense
things
had
led
up
to
it
and
made
it
logical
for
example
it
might
not
have
been
for
nothing
he
met
the
girl
on
the
train
and
got
hurt
his
hurt
had
kept
him
at
winnipeg
and
stopping
there
had
roused
his
discontent
then
he
had
met
vernon
who
wanted
him
to
know
the
english
it
was
possible
these
things
were
like
the
flashes
that
leaped
out
of
the
dark
he
would
know
where
they
pointed
when
the
journey
was
over
then
lister
smiled
and
knocked
out
his
pipe
when
he
went
on
deck
again
some
time
afterwards
the
ship
was
steering
for
a
gap
between
two
rows
of
twinkling
lights
they
ran
on
closing
on
each
other
like
electric
lamps
in
a
long
street
and
in
front
the
sky
shone
with
a
dull
red
glow
it
was
the
glimmer
of
a
great
port
they
were
entering
the
mersey
and
he
went
off
to
get
up
his
luggage
part
ii
the
reckoning
chapter
i
vernon
plot
lister
occupied
the
end
of
a
bench
on
the
lawn
at
carrock
cartwright
house
in
rannerdale
rannerdale
slopes
to
a
lake
in
the
north
country
and
the
old
house
stands
among
trees
and
rocks
in
a
sheltered
hollow
the
sun
shone
on
its
lichened
front
where
a
creeper
was
going
red
in
the
background
birches
with
silver
stems
and
leaves
like
showers
of
gold
gleamed
against
somber
firs
across
the
lawn
and
winding
road
the
tranquil
lake
reflected
bordering
woods
and
then
long
mountain
slopes
that
faded
from
yellow
and
green
to
purple
closed
the
view
while
lister
waited
for
the
tea
cartwright
had
given
him
to
cool
he
felt
the
charm
of
house
and
dale
was
strong
perhaps
it
owed
something
to
the
play
of
soft
light
and
shade
for
as
a
rule
in
canada
all
was
sharply
cut
the
english
landscape
had
a
strange
elusive
beauty
that
gripped
one
hard
and
melted
as
the
fleecy
clouds
rolled
by
when
the
light
came
back
color
and
line
were
as
beautiful
but
not
the
same
there
was
no
grass
in
canada
like
the
sweep
of
smooth
english
turf
and
lister
had
not
thought
a
house
could
give
the
sense
of
ancient
calm
one
got
at
carrock
since
his
boyhood
he
had
not
known
a
home
his
resting
place
had
been
a
shack
at
a
noisy
construction
camp
a
room
at
a
crowded
cheap
hotel
and
a
berth
beside
a
steamer
rattling
engines
then
the
shining
silver
on
the
was
something
new
he
marked
its
beauty
of
line
and
the
blue
and
gold
and
brown
pattern
on
the
delicate
china
he
was
almost
afraid
to
touch
in
fact
all
at
carrock
was
marked
by
a
strange
refinement
and
quiet
charm
he
liked
his
hosts
cartwright
was
large
rather
fat
and
placid
but
he
felt
the
house
and
all
it
stood
for
were
hers
by
rightful
inheritance
her
son
and
daughter
were
not
like
that
lister
thought
they
had
cultivated
their
serenity
and
by
doing
so
had
cultivated
out
some
virile
qualities
of
human
nature
grace
hyslop
had
beauty
but
not
much
charm
lister
thought
her
cold
and
imagined
her
prejudices
were
strong
and
conventional
mortimer
talk
and
manners
were
colorlessly
correct
lister
did
not
know
yet
if
hyslop
was
a
prig
or
not
cartwright
was
frankly
puzzling
he
looked
like
a
sober
country
gentleman
and
this
was
not
the
type
lister
had
thought
to
meet
his
clothes
were
fastidiously
good
his
voice
had
a
level
restrained
note
but
his
eye
was
like
a
hawk
as
vernon
had
said
now
and
then
one
saw
a
twinkle
of
ironical
amusement
and
some
of
his
movements
were
quick
and
vigorous
lister
thought
cartwright
blood
was
red
vernon
lounging
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
bench
talked
about
a
day
hyslop
and
he
had
spent
upon
the
rocks
and
rather
struck
a
foreign
note
he
had
not
hyslop
graceful
languidness
he
looked
alert
and
his
thin
face
was
too
grave
for
carrock
and
his
glance
too
quick
lister
listening
to
his
remarks
was
surprised
to
note
that
hyslop
was
a
bold
mountaineer
oh
well
he
said
with
a
deprecatory
smile
when
vernon
stopped
this
small
group
of
mountains
is
all
the
wild
belt
we
have
got
and
you
like
to
find
a
stranger
keen
about
your
favorite
sport
then
your
keenness
was
flattering
in
your
country
with
its
lonely
woods
and
rivers
running
to
the
north
you
have
a
field
for
strenuous
sport
and
adventure
the
woods
pull
vernon
agreed
all
the
same
i
a
business
man
betting
at
the
board
of
trade
is
my
proper
job
and
i
got
to
be
satisfied
with
a
week
at
a
fishing
camp
now
and
then
adventure
is
for
the
pioneers
lumber
men
and
railroad
builders
like
my
friend
lister
looked
up
he
did
not
see
why
vernon
talked
about
him
my
adventures
do
count
for
much
he
said
sometimes
a
car
went
into
a
muskeg
and
we
had
to
hustle
to
dig
her
out
sometimes
the
boys
made
trouble
about
their
pay
railroad
building
is
often
dull
i
do
know
if
we
all
modest
in
canada
but
my
partner
is
vernon
observed
if
you
want
a
romantic
tale
persuade
him
to
tell
you
how
he
got
the
mark
on
his
head
oh
shucks
said
lister
i
had
sooner
you
had
cut
that
out
he
turned
to
the
others
apologetically
it
was
a
dispute
with
a
fellow
on
board
a
train
who
threw
me
down
the
steps
i
do
want
to
bore
you
with
the
tale
the
man
was
the
famous
crook
shillito
vernon
remarked
cartwright
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
vernon
hard
then
he
looked
at
lister
who
felt
embarrassed
and
angry
he
saw
grace
and
cartwright
were
curious
and
thought
hyslop
glance
got
keen
if
it
will
not
bother
lister
we
would
like
to
hear
his
narrative
said
cartwright
quietly
but
lister
got
a
hint
of
command
he
narrated
his
adventure
on
the
train
and
although
he
tried
to
rob
the
story
of
its
romance
was
surprised
when
he
stopped
for
a
moment
vernon
was
carelessly
lighting
a
cigarette
but
lister
saw
his
carelessness
was
forced
when
he
got
a
light
he
crossed
the
grass
as
if
he
meant
to
throw
the
match
over
the
hedge
lister
thought
cartwright
watched
harry
with
dry
amusement
cartwright
look
was
obviously
disturbed
but
she
had
not
altogether
lost
her
calm
one
felt
her
calm
was
part
of
her
but
the
hyslops
was
cultivated
lister
imagined
it
cost
them
something
to
use
control
go
on
said
cartwright
rather
sharply
lister
resumed
but
presently
cartwright
stopped
him
you
imagined
the
girl
was
afraid
of
shillito
what
were
your
grounds
she
was
disturbed
and
declared
she
must
get
off
the
train
i
think
she
meant
to
jump
off
although
we
were
going
fast
then
she
asked
me
if
the
conductor
could
be
bribed
to
stop
perhaps
we
can
take
it
for
granted
she
wanted
to
get
away
from
somebody
why
did
you
surmise
the
man
was
shillito
he
came
through
the
car
afterwards
as
if
he
tried
to
find
the
girl
and
gave
me
a
keen
glance
when
he
came
back
i
thought
him
angry
and
disappointed
by
and
by
i
had
better
grounds
for
imagining
he
suspected
i
had
helped
her
cartwright
pondered
but
lister
did
not
think
he
doubted
it
rather
looked
as
if
he
weighed
something
carefully
the
lines
on
his
face
got
deeper
and
his
look
was
thoughtful
i
understand
the
girl
did
not
give
you
her
name
he
said
what
was
she
like
how
was
she
dressed
lister
was
rather
surprised
to
find
he
could
not
answer
satisfactorily
it
was
not
the
girl
physical
qualities
but
her
emotions
he
had
marked
he
remembered
the
pluck
with
which
she
had
struggled
against
the
fear
she
obviously
felt
her
impulsive
trust
when
he
offered
help
and
her
relief
when
she
got
into
the
locomotive
cab
although
he
had
studied
her
at
montreal
it
was
her
effort
to
play
a
part
that
impressed
him
most
she
was
young
and
i
think
attractive
he
replied
she
wore
a
knitted
cap
and
a
kind
of
jersey
a
girl
might
use
for
boating
i
thought
she
came
from
a
summer
camp
cartwright
face
was
inscrutable
but
lister
saw
the
others
interest
was
keen
cartwright
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
and
he
got
a
hint
of
suspense
although
grace
was
very
quiet
a
touch
of
color
had
come
to
her
skin
as
if
she
felt
humiliated
mortimer
pose
was
stiff
and
his
control
over
done
then
cartwright
turned
to
his
have
you
told
jones
about
the
box
of
plants
for
liverpool
grace
look
indicated
that
she
did
not
want
to
go
but
glance
was
insistent
and
she
got
up
lister
looked
about
and
saw
vernon
had
not
come
back
he
was
studying
the
plants
in
a
border
across
the
lawn
when
grace
had
gone
cartwright
asked
can
you
remember
the
evening
of
the
month
and
the
time
when
you
first
saw
the
girl
lister
fixed
the
date
and
added
it
was
nearly
ten
the
porter
had
just
gone
through
the
car
and
when
he
said
my
berth
was
ready
i
looked
at
my
watch
he
went
to
the
next
pullman
and
i
thought
he
was
getting
busy
late
cartwright
nodded
and
mortimer
glanced
at
him
sharply
but
next
moment
looked
imperturbable
cartwright
relief
however
was
obvious
her
face
had
become
animated
and
her
hands
trembled
thank
you
said
cartwright
go
on
lister
narrated
his
putting
the
girl
on
board
the
gravel
train
and
cartwright
interrupted
do
you
know
if
she
had
money
she
had
some
enough
to
buy
a
ticket
east
it
strange
said
cartwright
and
then
exclaimed
you
mean
you
gave
her
some
oh
well
said
lister
awkwardly
i
seen
her
look
at
her
purse
and
frown
and
as
i
helped
her
up
the
locomotive
steps
i
pushed
a
few
bills
into
her
hand
i
do
think
she
knew
they
were
paper
money
she
was
and
anxious
to
get
off
before
shillito
came
along
cartwright
gave
him
a
look
that
moved
him
her
eyes
shone
and
he
knew
she
was
his
friend
the
poor
girl
was
strangely
lucky
when
she
met
you
she
said
lister
resumed
his
narrative
but
it
was
plain
the
climax
had
passed
the
others
interest
was
now
polite
and
he
went
on
as
fast
as
possible
he
had
begun
to
see
a
light
and
wanted
to
finish
and
get
away
he
did
not
however
see
that
while
he
told
his
artless
tale
he
had
drawn
his
character
when
he
stopped
cartwright
said
then
you
did
not
know
her
name
i
do
know
it
yet
said
lister
as
coolly
as
he
could
but
got
embarrassed
when
he
saw
cartwright
smile
you
do
imagine
shillito
rejoined
her
afterwards
no
said
lister
firmly
i
think
it
impossible
the
gravel
train
was
going
east
and
when
the
police
boarded
the
cars
we
had
run
some
distance
west
he
stopped
for
a
moment
because
he
saw
he
was
very
dull
if
his
supposition
were
correct
there
was
something
the
others
ought
to
know
besides
he
resumed
i
met
her
not
long
since
at
montreal
at
montreal
cartwright
exclaimed
at
a
shop
where
they
sold
lister
replied
i
expect
to
meet
her
i
went
in
to
buy
some
enameled
things
it
was
a
pretty
good
shop
and
the
hotel
clerk
declared
the
people
were
all
right
she
knew
me
and
we
went
to
a
she
left
me
at
the
door
and
i
think
that
all
he
got
up
i
do
know
if
i
have
bored
you
but
i
felt
you
wanted
me
to
talk
now
i
must
get
off
and
i
want
to
see
harry
before
i
go
vernon
does
not
seem
to
be
about
cartwright
remarked
with
some
dryness
i
go
to
the
gate
with
you
cartwright
gave
lister
her
hand
and
her
glance
was
very
kind
you
will
come
back
so
long
as
you
stop
here
i
hope
you
will
feel
our
house
is
open
to
you
hyslop
got
up
but
cartwright
stopped
him
with
a
sign
he
was
quiet
while
they
crossed
the
lawn
but
when
they
reached
the
wood
by
the
road
he
said
i
imagine
you
know
we
owe
you
much
after
a
time
your
efforts
to
use
some
tact
were
rather
obvious
well
the
girl
you
helped
is
my
at
the
beginning
i
did
not
know
this
lister
declared
it
was
plain
said
cartwright
well
i
agree
with
her
mother
barbara
was
very
lucky
when
she
met
you
but
since
you
look
embarrassed
let
this
go
did
she
repay
your
loan
she
wanted
to
pay
me
said
lister
i
refused
why
cartwright
asked
looking
at
him
hard
lister
hesitated
for
one
thing
i
did
know
the
sum
then
i
knew
her
wages
were
not
high
you
ought
to
see
i
could
take
the
money
you
ought
to
have
taken
the
money
for
the
girl
sake
oh
said
lister
i
think
she
knew
i
did
refuse
because
i
wanted
her
to
feel
she
owed
me
something
it
possible
she
did
know
said
cartwright
dryly
you
must
try
to
remember
the
sum
when
you
come
again
now
i
want
the
name
of
the
shop
at
montreal
lister
told
him
and
added
you
mean
to
write
to
miss
hyslop
cartwright
smiled
i
going
across
as
soon
as
possible
to
bring
my
home
chapter
ii
barbara
return
when
lister
had
gone
cartwright
returned
to
the
and
looked
at
hyslop
who
got
up
and
went
off
hyslop
did
not
altogether
want
to
go
but
he
had
cultivated
discretion
and
it
was
plain
his
meant
to
get
rid
of
him
then
cartwright
gave
his
wife
a
sympathetic
glance
cartwright
was
calm
but
when
she
put
some
cups
together
her
hand
shook
leave
the
things
alone
said
cartwright
in
a
soothing
voice
plot
was
clever
do
you
think
harry
planned
that
lister
should
tell
us
it
looks
like
that
said
cartwright
dryly
he
was
keen
about
bringing
his
friend
over
but
was
cautious
enough
to
wait
until
the
fellow
began
to
know
us
when
he
talked
about
lister
adventures
i
wondered
where
he
was
leading
the
other
was
puzzled
and
did
see
until
near
the
end
but
why
did
harry
himself
tell
us
all
he
knew
vernon
a
good
sort
and
more
fastidious
than
one
thinks
he
saw
be
forced
to
venture
on
rather
awkward
ground
and
there
was
some
doubt
he
wanted
us
to
weigh
the
story
and
judge
if
the
clew
he
gave
us
ought
to
be
followed
this
was
not
vernon
job
although
i
think
he
was
satisfied
but
you
are
satisfied
yes
said
cartwright
lister
portrait
of
barbara
was
lifelike
and
his
own
was
pretty
good
i
think
he
drew
himself
and
her
better
than
he
knew
and
perhaps
it
lucky
we
have
to
deal
with
fellows
like
these
a
good
canadian
is
a
fine
type
however
we
must
bring
barbara
back
ah
said
cartwright
i
want
her
back
one
must
hide
one
hurt
but
to
hide
it
is
hard
she
pulled
herself
up
and
added
will
you
send
a
cablegram
i
think
not
the
girl
is
proud
and
as
wild
as
a
hawk
she
thinks
she
has
humiliated
us
and
if
she
startled
she
probably
run
away
you
do
think
she
has
humiliated
us
cartwright
said
in
a
hesitating
voice
cartwright
smiled
it
plain
that
her
escapade
must
not
be
talked
about
but
we
can
trust
these
canadians
and
i
know
barbara
in
a
sense
lister
narrative
was
necessary
the
girl
is
headstrong
but
i
was
persuaded
she
would
find
the
rascal
out
looks
as
if
she
did
so
soon
after
they
got
on
board
the
cars
and
i
imagine
shillito
had
an
awkward
few
moments
barbara
temper
is
not
mild
then
it
important
that
she
was
desperately
anxious
to
escape
from
him
there
no
more
to
be
said
cartwright
gave
him
a
grateful
look
her
husband
had
never
failed
her
and
he
had
justified
her
trust
again
if
you
do
send
a
cablegram
how
shall
we
get
barbara
back
i
go
myself
said
cartwright
if
she
ca
be
persuaded
i
bring
her
by
force
it
lucky
i
can
charge
the
cost
to
the
office
the
new
wheat
is
coming
down
to
montreal
and
the
people
have
a
plan
to
get
it
all
but
i
expect
to
beat
them
and
engage
some
cargo
for
our
boats
before
the
lawrence
freezes
however
since
i
going
i
must
get
to
work
he
started
for
the
house
and
met
his
at
the
porch
mortimer
looked
thoughtful
and
held
an
unlighted
cigarette
cartwright
studied
him
with
scornful
amusement
have
you
been
speculating
about
the
proper
way
of
handling
an
awkward
situation
i
have
been
talking
to
grace
hyslop
replied
in
an
even
voice
i
rather
think
grace
has
been
talking
to
you
but
expect
you
agreed
you
have
no
doubt
decided
the
best
plan
is
to
leave
your
headstrong
sister
alone
we
did
agree
about
something
like
that
said
hyslop
coolly
although
when
cartwright
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
he
turned
his
head
we
thought
if
barbara
were
given
an
allowance
she
might
for
example
stay
with
the
vernons
grace
notion
cartwright
mouth
got
hard
and
his
mustache
bristled
when
he
was
moved
his
urbanity
vanished
and
his
talk
was
very
blunt
we
let
grace
notion
go
my
form
is
not
my
but
i
try
to
moderate
my
remarks
about
women
we
admit
grace
is
a
woman
although
i
sometimes
doubt
anyhow
you
are
not
a
man
you
have
a
drop
of
warm
blood
in
your
veins
you
a
curled
and
scented
fine
lady
pup
i
do
see
much
use
in
talking
about
my
qualities
sir
you
do
see
cartwright
agreed
that
your
drawback
you
see
nothing
that
rude
and
human
you
afraid
to
look
all
that
obvious
is
barbara
must
not
come
home
to
throw
an
awkward
reflection
on
puritanical
virtue
people
might
find
out
something
and
talk
if
anybody
talks
while
i
about
i
ram
the
implication
down
his
throat
you
do
see
or
perhaps
you
do
mind
the
drawbacks
to
separating
barbara
from
her
mother
and
banishing
her
from
home
she
trustful
rash
and
fiery
and
not
a
statue
like
grace
anyhow
barbara
is
coming
back
and
if
you
do
approve
i
expect
you
to
be
resigned
now
get
off
before
i
let
myself
go
hyslop
went
one
gained
nothing
by
arguing
with
a
brute
like
cartwright
and
since
cartwright
infatuation
for
her
husband
could
not
be
disturbed
hyslop
knew
he
must
acquiesce
cartwright
rather
braced
by
the
encounter
went
to
the
library
and
wrote
some
letters
to
liverpool
a
few
days
afterwards
he
packed
his
trunk
and
was
driven
to
the
station
in
cartwright
car
grace
got
up
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
in
order
to
see
him
off
and
when
she
brought
his
scarf
and
gloves
cartwright
accepted
her
ministrations
with
politeness
although
he
knew
she
disapproved
of
him
she
thought
her
duty
was
to
do
things
like
this
and
he
played
up
when
the
throb
of
the
car
was
getting
faint
she
met
mortimer
going
to
the
lake
he
stopped
and
looked
up
at
the
valley
which
was
streaked
by
a
thin
line
of
dust
for
three
or
four
weeks
we
be
undisturbed
he
said
i
admit
i
like
carrock
better
when
my
is
away
barbara
coming
back
with
him
grace
remarked
in
some
ways
her
return
will
be
awkward
but
perhaps
she
ought
to
come
mortimer
gave
her
a
surprised
glance
this
was
not
your
view
oh
well
i
have
been
thinking
barbara
is
rash
and
very
young
in
canada
she
would
be
free
from
all
control
and
one
must
not
weigh
drawbacks
against
one
duty
perhaps
cartwright
takes
the
proper
line
although
of
course
it
costs
him
nothing
you
did
tell
me
what
he
said
the
other
evening
mortimer
shrugged
as
a
rule
my
remarks
wo
bear
he
was
a
little
franker
than
usual
he
coarse
said
grace
one
feels
he
gets
coarser
as
if
his
thoughts
had
begun
to
react
on
his
body
there
is
a
link
and
of
course
with
his
habits
i
rather
think
you
mean
with
his
appetites
cartwright
does
not
often
let
himself
go
when
he
at
home
but
when
he
is
away
he
another
man
grace
looked
thoughtful
one
likes
restraint
all
the
same
i
sometimes
think
rude
primitive
people
have
a
vigor
we
have
not
it
strange
but
indulgence
seems
to
go
with
force
one
feels
our
friends
are
rather
i
using
cartwright
phrase
our
canadian
friends
are
not
bloodless
i
expect
you
have
remarked
that
barbara
the
type
they
like
she
has
an
appeal
for
men
like
that
grace
agreed
and
mused
it
was
hard
to
own
but
she
began
to
see
that
when
she
thought
barbara
ought
to
stop
in
canada
she
was
inspired
by
jealousy
barbara
charm
for
men
was
strong
and
when
she
was
about
they
left
grace
alone
still
she
had
a
vague
perception
that
her
sister
charm
was
not
altogether
physical
she
herself
had
a
classical
beauty
that
did
not
mark
the
younger
girl
it
looked
as
if
barbara
had
attractive
qualities
that
were
not
hers
lister
for
example
was
not
a
brute
like
cartwright
but
it
was
plain
that
barbara
had
attracted
him
grace
approved
his
soberness
and
frank
gravity
and
then
she
pulled
herself
up
she
must
not
be
jealous
about
her
sister
cartwright
power
is
stronger
because
he
does
not
use
our
money
mortimer
resumed
i
do
know
if
it
was
cleverness
or
scruples
that
urged
him
to
refuse
all
the
same
if
he
were
forced
to
ask
help
his
influence
would
be
less
but
his
needing
help
is
not
probable
he
managing
owner
of
the
line
mortimer
smiled
he
gets
a
commission
on
the
boat
earnings
but
does
not
hold
many
shares
then
the
fleet
is
small
and
the
boats
do
earn
very
much
things
are
not
going
smoothly
and
some
shareholders
would
like
to
put
cartwright
off
the
board
at
the
last
meeting
one
fellow
talked
about
the
need
for
fresh
blood
however
i
expect
clever
enough
to
keep
off
the
rocks
and
when
one
ca
get
rid
of
a
drawback
one
must
submit
lighting
a
cigarette
he
started
for
the
lake
and
grace
returned
thoughtfully
to
the
house
mortimer
hated
cartwright
and
grace
admitted
he
had
some
grounds
although
her
brother
was
indolent
and
philosophical
he
did
not
forget
rude
disputes
jarred
him
but
if
by
some
chance
he
was
able
to
injure
the
other
grace
thought
he
would
do
so
grace
herself
strongly
disapproved
of
cartwright
all
the
same
he
was
her
and
she
had
tried
to
cultivate
her
sense
of
duty
she
was
prejudiced
cold
and
censorious
but
she
meant
to
be
just
and
did
not
like
mortimer
bitterness
cartwright
was
occupied
for
some
time
at
montreal
and
the
birch
leaves
had
fallen
when
he
returned
the
evening
was
dark
and
chilly
mist
rolled
down
the
dale
but
a
big
fire
burned
in
the
hall
at
carrock
and
tall
lamps
threw
a
cheerful
light
on
the
oak
paneling
a
flooded
beck
roared
in
the
hollow
of
a
ghyll
across
the
lawn
and
its
turmoil
echoed
about
the
hall
cartwright
stood
by
the
fire
grace
moved
restlessly
about
and
mortimer
appeared
to
be
absorbed
by
the
news
i
wish
you
would
sit
down
mother
he
said
presently
you
can
hear
the
car
you
know
and
the
train
is
often
late
for
a
few
minutes
cartwright
did
not
move
and
then
she
started
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
door
she
heard
an
engine
throb
there
was
a
noise
in
the
porch
and
a
cold
wind
blew
into
the
room
then
the
door
opened
and
cartwright
entered
shaking
the
damp
from
his
fur
coat
he
turned
beckoning
somebody
behind
and
barbara
came
out
from
the
arch
her
face
was
flushed
her
eyes
were
hard
and
she
stopped
irresolutely
mortimer
advanced
to
take
the
coat
she
carried
and
grace
crossed
the
floor
but
barbara
waited
as
if
she
did
not
see
them
then
her
strained
look
vanished
for
cartwright
went
forward
with
awkward
speed
and
took
her
in
her
arms
cartwright
saw
his
wife
had
forgotten
him
and
turning
to
the
others
with
a
commanding
gesture
drove
them
and
the
servants
from
the
hall
when
they
had
gone
he
gave
cartwright
a
smile
i
brought
her
back
he
said
not
altogether
an
easy
job
ridiculous
but
she
can
fight
he
went
off
and
barbara
clung
to
her
mother
she
was
shaking
and
her
breath
came
hard
you
were
ridiculous
said
cartwright
in
a
gentle
voice
i
expect
you
were
very
obstinate
but
he
was
kind
he
a
dear
i
love
him
barbara
replied
he
understands
everything
i
think
he
ought
to
have
stopped
at
liverpool
the
secretary
met
us
and
talked
about
some
business
but
if
he
had
come
with
me
i
could
not
have
borne
she
stopped
and
resting
her
head
on
cartwright
shoulder
began
to
cry
cartwright
said
nothing
but
kissed
and
soothed
her
with
loving
gentleness
when
some
time
afterwards
barbara
came
down
the
stairs
that
occupied
one
side
of
the
hall
she
was
composed
but
tea
by
the
fire
was
something
of
a
strain
it
was
plain
that
grace
careless
talk
was
forced
and
mortimer
efforts
to
keep
on
safe
ground
were
marked
now
and
then
cartwright
eyes
twinkled
and
barbara
thought
she
knew
why
he
sometimes
made
a
joke
that
jarred
the
others
when
the
meal
was
over
he
took
them
away
i
imagine
your
sister
understands
grace
and
you
are
willing
to
take
her
back
and
forget
the
pain
she
gave
you
he
said
to
hyslop
your
handling
of
the
situation
was
tactful
and
correct
but
you
can
leave
her
to
her
mother
cartwright
stopped
with
barbara
who
brought
a
footstool
to
the
hearthrug
and
sitting
down
leaned
against
her
knee
i
have
been
an
obstinate
selfish
romantic
fool
she
broke
out
cartwright
touched
her
hair
and
smiled
for
she
felt
comforted
this
was
the
tempestuous
barbara
she
thought
she
had
lost
my
dear
she
said
it
not
important
since
you
have
come
back
i
ought
to
have
come
back
if
you
had
not
sent
father
i
would
not
have
come
he
determined
but
he
gentle
you
know
he
sympathizes
although
i
wanted
him
to
go
i
did
not
send
him
cartwright
replied
he
went
because
he
loves
you
but
we
can
talk
about
this
again
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
went
on
it
was
not
long
i
think
before
you
found
shillito
was
a
thief
lister
story
indicated
this
a
wave
of
color
came
to
barbara
skin
but
she
looked
up
and
her
eyes
flashed
at
the
beginning
i
did
not
know
he
was
a
thief
i
found
out
he
was
a
cunning
brute
afterwards
when
i
read
about
his
escape
in
the
newspapers
i
rather
wished
the
trooper
who
shot
at
him
had
not
missed
she
shook
with
horror
and
anger
and
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
she
resumed
i
ca
tell
you
all
mother
i
was
frightened
but
anger
gave
me
pluck
he
said
i
must
stick
to
him
because
i
could
not
go
back
i
think
i
struck
him
and
then
i
ran
away
people
were
going
to
their
berths
in
the
pullman
and
he
durst
not
use
force
when
i
got
to
the
car
platform
and
was
going
to
jump
off
i
saw
lister
but
he
has
told
you
cartwright
nodded
for
she
was
satisfied
my
dear
she
said
it
done
with
still
i
wonder
why
you
were
willing
to
leave
us
sometimes
i
wonder
to
begin
with
i
have
owned
i
was
a
fool
but
things
were
dreary
and
i
wanted
a
thrill
then
i
had
begun
to
feel
nobody
at
home
wanted
me
father
and
you
were
kind
but
he
seemed
to
think
me
an
amusing
willful
child
grace
always
disapproved
and
mortimer
sneered
they
knew
i
was
not
their
sort
and
very
proper
people
are
cruel
if
you
wo
obey
their
rules
i
hated
rules
correctness
made
me
rebel
then
louis
came
and
declared
i
was
all
to
him
he
was
handsome
and
romantic
and
i
was
tired
of
restraint
i
thought
i
loved
him
but
it
was
ridiculous
because
i
hate
him
now
mortimer
a
prig
but
louis
is
a
brute
cartwright
sighed
she
liked
tranquillity
and
the
girl
passion
jarred
she
tried
to
soothe
her
and
presently
barbara
asked
in
a
level
voice
where
is
harry
vernon
he
went
to
town
a
few
days
since
when
he
knew
i
would
soon
arrive
his
going
is
significant
i
shall
hate
harry
next
you
must
not
be
unjust
i
imagine
he
thought
to
meet
him
would
embarrass
you
it
would
have
embarrassed
me
but
harry
would
not
have
known
barbara
declared
if
i
have
been
a
fool
i
can
pay
still
i
ought
to
have
stayed
in
canada
father
obstinate
and
i
wanted
to
come
home
but
things
will
be
harder
than
at
montreal
cartwright
kissed
her
my
poor
child
the
hurt
is
not
as
deep
as
you
think
we
will
try
to
help
you
to
forget
chapter
iii
lister
clears
the
ground
the
sun
was
on
the
rocks
and
the
lichen
shone
in
rings
of
soft
and
varied
color
blue
shadows
filled
the
dale
which
from
the
side
of
the
buttress
looked
profoundly
deep
a
row
of
young
men
and
women
followed
a
ledge
that
crossed
the
face
of
the
steep
crag
mortimer
hyslop
leading
a
girl
and
vernon
a
few
yards
behind
lister
and
barbara
farther
off
hyslop
knew
the
rocks
and
was
a
good
leader
he
was
cool
and
cautious
and
did
not
undertake
a
climb
until
he
was
satisfied
about
his
companions
powers
the
slanting
edge
looked
dangerous
but
was
not
although
one
must
be
steady
and
there
was
an
awkward
corner
at
the
turning
the
ledge
got
narrow
and
one
must
seize
a
knob
and
then
step
lightly
on
a
stone
embedded
in
mossy
soil
when
they
reached
the
spot
hyslop
stopped
and
told
vernon
what
to
do
the
girl
immediately
behind
him
was
a
clever
mountaineer
they
went
round
and
lister
watched
from
a
few
yards
off
for
a
moment
or
two
each
in
turn
supported
by
one
foot
with
body
braced
against
the
rock
grasped
the
knob
and
vanished
round
the
corner
it
was
plain
one
must
get
a
firm
hold
but
lister
thought
this
was
all
he
was
used
to
the
tall
skeleton
trestles
that
carried
the
rails
across
canadian
ravines
after
the
others
disappeared
lister
seized
the
knob
he
thought
the
stone
he
stood
on
moved
and
he
cautiously
took
a
heavier
strain
on
his
arm
he
could
get
across
but
he
obeyed
an
impulse
and
gave
the
stone
a
push
it
rolled
out
and
when
he
swung
himself
back
to
the
ledge
plunged
down
and
smashed
upon
the
rocks
below
for
a
few
moments
the
echoes
rolled
about
the
crags
and
then
hyslop
shouted
are
you
all
right
can
you
get
round
lister
said
he
thought
not
and
hyslop
replied
that
it
did
not
matter
barbara
would
take
him
up
a
grassy
ridge
and
the
others
would
meet
them
at
the
top
a
rattle
of
nailed
boots
indicated
that
he
was
going
off
and
lister
turned
and
glanced
at
barbara
she
had
sat
down
on
an
inclined
slab
and
her
figure
and
face
in
profile
cut
against
the
sky
a
yard
or
two
beneath
her
the
sloping
rock
vanished
at
the
top
of
a
steep
pitch
and
one
saw
nothing
but
the
crags
across
the
narrow
dale
yet
lister
thought
the
girl
was
not
disturbed
i
expect
i
was
clumsy
he
apologized
well
she
said
it
looks
like
that
he
gave
her
a
quick
glance
and
pondered
although
he
had
gone
to
carrock
since
she
came
home
she
had
been
strangely
cold
and
so
to
speak
aloof
he
had
imagined
their
meeting
might
embarrass
her
but
she
was
not
embarrassed
in
fact
she
had
met
him
as
if
he
were
a
friend
but
he
had
not
seen
her
afterwards
unless
somebody
was
about
now
he
meant
to
force
her
to
be
frank
i
was
clumsy
he
resumed
all
the
same
when
i
felt
the
stone
begin
to
move
i
might
have
pulled
myself
across
by
my
hands
i
expect
the
block
would
have
been
firm
enough
to
carry
you
yes
i
know
said
barbara
you
did
want
me
to
get
across
lister
studied
her
he
doubted
if
it
was
altogether
exertion
that
had
brought
the
blood
to
her
skin
and
given
her
eyes
the
keen
sparkle
clinging
to
the
rock
with
the
shadowy
gulf
below
she
looked
strangely
alert
and
virile
her
figure
cut
against
the
sky
he
noted
its
slenderness
and
lines
she
was
not
angry
although
he
had
admitted
he
pushed
down
the
stone
but
he
felt
as
if
something
divided
them
and
doubted
if
he
could
remove
the
obstacle
i
wanted
to
talk
and
had
found
i
could
not
get
near
you
unless
the
others
were
about
he
said
it
looked
as
if
i
had
unconsciously
given
you
some
grounds
for
standing
me
off
well
i
suppose
i
did
put
your
relations
on
your
track
it
was
that
said
barbara
i
imagine
harry
vernon
helped
you
there
you
were
forced
to
tell
your
story
i
was
forced
all
the
same
i
think
harry
plan
was
good
he
went
away
a
few
days
before
i
arrived
barbara
remarked
lister
thought
he
saw
where
she
led
and
knitted
his
brows
he
was
on
awkward
ground
and
might
say
too
much
but
to
say
nothing
might
be
worse
harry
a
good
sort
and
i
expect
he
pulled
out
because
he
imagined
you
sooner
he
did
so
he
said
for
all
that
i
reckon
he
ought
to
have
stayed
although
her
color
was
vivid
barbara
gave
him
a
searching
glance
in
order
to
imply
i
had
no
grounds
for
embarrassment
if
i
met
him
harry
was
at
the
camp
in
the
woods
he
knew
you
had
no
grounds
for
embarrassment
lister
declared
i
knew
and
harry
an
older
friend
barbara
turned
her
head
and
when
she
looked
back
lister
thought
his
boldness
was
justified
in
a
sense
she
had
been
very
frank
although
perhaps
this
situation
made
for
frankness
they
were
alone
on
the
face
of
the
towering
crag
all
was
very
quiet
but
for
the
noise
of
falling
water
and
the
only
living
object
one
could
see
was
a
buzzard
hovering
high
up
at
a
white
cloud
edge
one
could
talk
in
the
mountain
solitude
as
one
could
not
talk
in
a
for
all
that
lister
felt
he
had
not
altogether
broken
the
girl
reserve
one
envies
men
like
you
who
build
railways
and
sail
ships
she
said
and
now
lister
wondered
where
she
led
you
live
a
natural
life
knowing
bodily
strain
and
primitive
emotions
sometimes
you
exhausted
and
sometimes
afraid
your
thought
fixed
on
the
struggle
you
keenly
occupied
is
it
like
that
something
like
that
lister
agreed
sometimes
the
strain
gets
monotonous
but
it
often
thrilling
men
and
women
need
to
be
thrilled
people
talk
about
the
modern
lust
for
excitement
but
it
is
modern
and
i
expect
the
instinct
sound
civilization
that
gives
us
hot
water
before
we
get
up
and
food
we
did
grow
is
not
all
an
advantage
our
bodies
get
soft
and
we
driven
back
on
our
emotions
where
we
want
action
we
get
talk
then
one
gets
up
against
the
rules
you
must
be
angry
you
must
be
sincere
you
must
use
a
dreary
level
calm
lister
was
puzzled
and
said
nothing
but
barbara
went
on
perhaps
some
girls
like
this
others
do
and
now
and
then
rebel
we
feel
human
we
want
to
live
adventure
calls
us
as
it
calls
you
we
want
to
front
life
shocks
and
storms
unsatisfied
curiosity
drives
us
on
then
perhaps
romance
comes
and
all
the
common
longings
of
flesh
and
blood
are
transfigured
she
stopped
and
lister
began
to
see
a
light
this
was
her
apology
for
her
rashness
in
canada
all
she
would
give
and
he
doubted
if
she
had
given
as
much
to
others
on
the
whole
he
thought
the
apology
good
romance
cheats
one
now
and
then
he
remarked
and
pulled
himself
up
awkwardly
but
barbara
was
calm
i
wonder
whether
it
always
cheats
one
i
think
not
he
said
sometimes
one
must
trust
one
luck
and
venture
all
the
same
philosophizing
is
not
my
habit
and
when
i
step
lightly
on
the
stone
you
mean
when
you
pushed
the
stone
down
barbara
interrupted
oh
well
anyhow
i
did
mean
to
philosophize
i
wanted
to
find
out
why
you
kept
away
from
me
although
you
knew
why
i
did
so
you
admitted
you
knew
why
harry
went
off
i
see
i
got
to
talk
said
lister
shillito
was
a
cheat
but
when
you
found
him
out
you
tried
to
jump
off
the
train
you
let
me
help
because
i
think
you
trusted
me
i
did
trust
you
it
much
to
know
my
trust
was
justified
for
one
thing
it
looks
as
if
i
was
altogether
a
fool
afterwards
when
i
met
you
at
montreal
you
were
friendly
although
you
tried
to
persuade
me
you
were
a
shop
girl
barbara
smiled
i
was
a
shop
girl
besides
you
were
a
stranger
and
it
sometimes
easy
to
trust
people
one
does
not
expect
to
see
again
my
plan
to
trust
the
people
i
like
all
the
time
lister
replied
when
i
found
you
on
the
car
platform
i
knew
i
ought
to
help
i
saw
you
meant
to
escape
from
something
mean
then
at
montreal
it
was
plain
you
were
trying
in
make
good
because
you
were
proud
and
would
not
go
back
i
liked
that
although
i
thought
you
were
not
logical
well
i
told
your
story
because
vernon
bluffed
me
but
if
i
known
your
as
i
know
him
now
i
have
told
the
tale
before
then
it
was
in
order
that
i
might
understand
this
you
sent
the
stone
down
the
crag
i
think
it
was
said
lister
i
hope
i
have
so
to
speak
cleared
the
ground
barbara
gave
him
a
puzzling
smile
you
rather
obvious
but
important
you
mean
to
be
nice
however
i
expect
the
others
are
waiting
for
us
and
we
must
join
them
although
we
wo
go
by
the
grass
ridge
she
indicated
the
slope
of
cracked
rock
in
front
the
hold
is
pretty
good
do
you
think
you
can
get
up
lister
doubted
he
was
athletic
and
steady
but
the
climb
looked
awkward
for
a
beginner
if
you
are
going
i
try
you
imagine
you
can
go
where
i
can
go
something
like
that
lister
admitted
if
i
beaten
accountable
and
will
have
to
help
he
was
satisfied
by
barbara
frank
laugh
her
mood
was
changeable
not
long
since
he
had
with
awkward
sympathy
thought
her
a
proud
humiliated
woman
now
she
was
marked
by
the
humor
of
a
careless
girl
he
could
however
play
up
to
her
later
mood
and
when
they
set
off
he
began
to
joke
the
rock
slanted
and
cracks
and
breaks
gave
a
firm
hold
but
there
was
not
a
crack
wherever
one
was
needed
and
the
pitch
was
steep
then
in
places
the
slabs
were
slippery
with
wet
lichen
and
lister
ordinary
walking
boots
could
get
no
grip
his
jokes
stopped
and
the
sweat
began
to
dew
his
face
his
breath
got
hard
and
he
felt
his
heart
beat
it
was
obvious
that
climbing
needed
study
for
all
that
he
went
on
and
found
a
strange
delight
in
watching
barbara
her
clothes
harmonized
with
the
soft
colors
of
lichen
and
stone
her
movements
were
confident
and
light
he
got
no
sense
of
effort
her
pose
was
seldom
strained
and
the
lines
of
her
limbs
and
body
flowed
in
easy
curves
he
thought
she
rather
flitted
than
labored
up
the
rock
practice
no
doubt
accounted
for
much
but
something
was
due
to
temperament
barbara
did
not
hesitate
she
trusted
her
luck
and
went
ahead
at
length
she
stopped
pressed
against
the
stone
in
the
hollow
of
a
gully
while
lister
crept
obliquely
across
a
long
wet
slab
he
looked
up
and
saw
her
face
finely
colored
after
effort
against
a
background
of
green
and
gold
the
berries
on
a
small
in
a
cranny
harmonized
with
the
carmine
of
her
skin
she
looked
down
and
smiled
with
careless
amusement
then
lister
foot
slipped
and
he
could
get
no
hold
for
his
hands
his
smooth
boots
drew
a
greasy
line
across
the
wet
slab
as
he
slid
down
perhaps
the
risk
was
not
very
daunting
but
he
knew
he
must
not
roll
down
far
at
the
bottom
of
the
slab
he
brought
up
with
his
foot
braced
against
a
knob
and
he
saw
barbara
coming
after
him
when
she
stopped
her
glance
was
apologetic
i
forgot
you
had
proper
boots
give
me
your
hand
and
try
again
no
thanks
said
lister
do
you
think
i
going
to
let
you
pull
me
up
why
not
she
asked
with
a
twinkle
to
begin
with
i
obstinate
and
do
mean
to
be
beaten
by
a
bit
of
greasy
rock
then
i
expect
i
heavier
than
you
think
you
ridiculously
proud
it
would
hurt
to
let
a
girl
help
barbara
rejoined
after
all
you
a
conventionalist
and
i
rather
thought
you
were
not
anyhow
i
going
up
myself
lister
declared
he
got
up
but
his
clothes
gathered
some
slime
from
the
rock
and
his
skin
was
stained
by
soil
and
moss
barbara
looked
at
him
with
a
twinkle
your
obstinacy
cost
you
something
she
remarked
if
you
tired
you
had
better
stop
and
smoke
lister
lighted
a
cigarette
she
had
been
rather
keen
about
rejoining
the
others
but
he
thought
she
had
forgotten
barbara
carelessness
gave
her
charm
perhaps
he
ought
to
go
on
but
he
meant
to
take
the
extra
few
minutes
luck
had
given
him
i
really
sorry
i
forgot
about
your
boots
and
brought
you
up
the
rock
she
said
i
wonder
why
you
did
bring
me
up
oh
well
a
number
of
the
men
i
know
have
a
comfortable
feeling
of
superiority
of
course
nice
men
do
make
you
feel
this
but
there
one
likes
to
give
such
pride
a
jolt
i
think
i
see
if
it
some
comfort
i
own
you
can
beat
me
going
up
awkward
rocks
but
where
does
this
take
us
barbara
smiled
it
takes
us
some
distance
when
you
admit
a
girl
your
equal
friendship
easier
you
know
one
reason
mortimer
and
i
agree
is
his
feeling
of
superiority
is
horribly
strong
could
you
take
him
up
an
awkward
gully
and
get
him
stuck
no
said
barbara
in
a
regretful
voice
he
really
a
good
cragsman
and
knows
exactly
how
far
he
can
go
when
he
starts
an
awkward
climb
he
reckons
up
all
the
obstacles
and
is
ready
to
get
round
them
when
they
come
the
plan
good
people
like
mortimer
do
get
stuck
it
possible
but
i
expect
they
miss
something
now
and
then
there
is
much
thrill
in
knowing
you
are
safe
sometimes
you
play
up
rather
well
barbara
remarked
i
not
playing
up
i
preaching
my
code
i
not
as
sober
and
cautious
as
you
perhaps
think
for
example
you
probably
get
bored
but
in
canada
i
turned
down
a
pretty
good
job
because
it
was
monotonous
i
wanted
something
fresh
and
thought
go
across
and
see
the
old
country
well
i
here
and
all
charming
but
i
do
know
how
i
get
back
when
my
wad
runs
out
ah
said
barbara
you
mean
your
money
will
soon
be
gone
but
you
have
relations
somebody
would
help
it
possible
but
i
would
refuse
lister
rejoined
you
not
adventuring
much
when
another
meets
the
bill
when
my
wallet
empty
i
pull
out
and
take
any
old
job
the
chances
are
i
go
to
sea
barbara
gave
him
an
approving
glance
she
had
known
but
one
other
adventurer
and
he
was
a
rogue
lister
was
honest
and
she
thought
he
would
go
far
she
liked
his
rashness
but
if
he
found
it
hard
to
get
on
board
ship
she
imagined
she
could
help
all
the
same
she
would
not
talk
about
this
yet
we
really
must
go
she
said
and
they
started
up
a
gully
where
holes
and
wedged
stones
helped
them
up
like
steps
when
they
left
the
gully
they
saw
a
group
of
people
on
the
neighboring
summit
of
the
hill
and
for
a
moment
lister
stopped
we
have
had
a
glorious
climb
he
said
now
it
over
i
hope
not
going
to
stand
me
off
again
barbara
gave
him
a
curious
smile
one
ca
stop
on
the
mountains
long
we
going
down
to
the
level
and
all
looks
different
there
the
others
began
to
wave
to
them
and
crossing
a
belt
of
boggy
grass
they
joined
the
group
when
they
returned
to
carrock
cartwright
was
not
about
and
cartwright
said
he
had
got
a
telegram
calling
him
to
liverpool
chapter
iv
a
dissatisfied
shareholder
cartwright
had
read
the
morning
letters
and
the
of
and
finding
nothing
important
turned
his
revolving
chair
to
the
fire
he
had
been
forced
to
wait
for
a
train
at
a
draughty
station
and
his
feet
were
cold
his
office
occupied
an
upper
floor
of
an
building
near
the
docks
fog
from
the
river
rolled
up
the
street
and
the
windows
were
grimed
by
soot
but
cartwright
had
not
turned
on
the
electric
light
the
fire
snapped
cheerfully
and
he
lighted
his
pipe
and
looked
about
the
furniture
was
shabby
the
carpet
was
getting
threadbare
and
some
of
the
glass
in
the
partition
that
cut
off
the
clerks
office
was
cracked
cartwright
had
thought
about
modernizing
and
decorating
the
rooms
but
to
do
the
thing
properly
would
cost
five
hundred
pounds
and
money
was
scarce
besides
a
number
of
the
merchants
who
shipped
goods
by
his
boats
were
conservative
and
rather
approved
his
keeping
the
parsimonious
rules
of
the
old
school
the
house
was
old
and
had
been
at
one
time
rich
and
powerful
cartwright
father
however
had
used
sailing
ships
too
long
and
cartwright
speculations
and
extravagance
when
he
took
control
had
not
mended
its
fortunes
then
had
come
a
number
of
lean
years
when
few
shipping
companies
earned
a
dividend
and
the
line
capital
steadily
melted
now
the
shareholders
were
not
numerous
and
the
ships
were
small
cartwright
glanced
at
the
pictures
in
tarnished
gold
frames
drawn
plunging
across
an
atlantic
comber
was
the
best
of
the
fleet
but
her
engineer
had
for
some
time
demanded
new
boilers
since
the
reserve
fund
was
low
and
other
boats
needed
expensive
repairs
cartwright
resolved
to
wait
he
had
bought
above
the
fireplace
very
cheap
but
her
engines
were
clumsy
compounds
and
she
cost
much
to
coal
still
she
was
fast
and
now
and
then
got
a
paying
load
by
reaching
a
port
where
freights
were
high
before
the
found
out
that
cartwright
meant
to
cut
the
rates
with
the
white
deckhouse
and
carried
a
good
load
on
a
light
draught
and
sometimes
picked
up
a
profitable
cargo
in
shallow
african
lagoons
when
he
glanced
at
her
picture
look
got
thoughtful
she
was
one
of
two
sister
ships
launched
at
a
famous
yard
and
cartwright
had
wanted
both
but
the
builders
demanded
terms
of
payment
he
could
not
meet
and
another
company
had
bought
the
vessel
she
was
wrecked
soon
afterwards
and
now
lay
buried
in
the
sand
by
an
african
river
bar
the
salvage
company
had
given
up
their
efforts
to
float
her
but
cartwright
imagined
she
could
be
floated
if
one
were
willing
to
run
a
risk
but
no
one
it
seemed
was
willing
on
the
failure
of
the
salvage
company
the
underwriters
had
put
the
steamer
into
the
hands
of
bull
and
morse
a
firm
of
ship
brokers
and
marine
auctioneers
but
at
the
public
auction
no
bids
whatever
had
been
made
subsequently
advertisements
appeared
in
the
shipping
papers
inviting
offers
for
the
ship
as
she
lay
and
for
the
salvage
of
the
cargo
these
had
run
for
several
weeks
but
without
result
cartwright
had
cut
them
out
now
and
then
he
looked
at
them
and
speculated
about
the
undertaking
by
and
by
the
bookkeeper
came
in
and
filed
some
letters
gavin
hair
was
going
white
and
he
had
been
with
cartwright
since
he
was
a
boy
he
was
fat
and
humorous
although
his
humor
was
not
refined
gavin
liked
to
be
thought
something
of
a
sport
but
cartwright
knew
he
was
staunch
you
imagine
seaton
will
look
me
up
this
morning
cartwright
said
presently
yes
sir
she
called
and
demanded
to
see
you
in
fact
i
think
she
doubted
when
i
told
her
you
had
come
back
from
the
north
she
said
the
shareholders
meeting
would
be
soon
and
she
expected
you
to
give
a
bigger
dividend
the
blue
funnel
people
had
paid
five
per
cent
if
you
did
return
before
long
she
might
run
up
to
carrock
so
i
sent
the
telegram
cartwright
nodded
he
trusted
his
bookkeeper
who
had
grounds
for
imagining
it
was
not
altogether
desirable
seaton
should
arrive
at
carrock
have
you
heard
anything
from
manners
while
i
was
away
nothing
direct
sir
his
nephew
hatton
came
round
with
a
tender
for
the
bunker
coal
and
implied
that
he
ought
to
get
the
job
then
i
had
a
notion
seaton
so
to
speak
was
looked
as
if
somebody
had
got
at
her
her
arguments
about
the
dividend
were
rather
good
it
possible
said
cartwright
dryly
if
she
comes
you
can
show
her
in
but
what
about
the
wine
i
do
know
if
it
will
see
you
out
there
not
a
great
deal
left
and
last
time
cartwright
eyes
twinkled
exactly
send
for
another
bottle
and
see
you
get
the
proper
stuff
some
of
the
biscuits
too
you
know
the
kind
rather
a
bother
but
perhaps
the
best
plan
safer
than
going
out
to
lunch
gavin
remarked
then
in
the
office
you
on
your
own
ground
that
counts
gives
you
moral
support
and
handicaps
an
antagonist
who
not
a
business
man
cartwright
suggested
well
perhaps
it
does
so
but
i
see
some
drawbacks
anyhow
get
the
wine
gavin
went
off
and
cartwright
mused
by
the
fire
the
morning
was
raw
and
foggy
and
if
he
went
out
the
damp
might
get
at
his
throat
moreover
gavin
would
reply
to
his
letters
cartwright
had
begun
to
feel
it
was
time
to
let
others
work
while
he
looked
on
his
control
counted
for
less
than
he
had
thought
things
went
without
much
guidance
and
it
was
enough
to
give
them
a
push
in
the
proper
direction
now
and
then
to
rouse
himself
for
an
effort
was
getting
harder
and
he
would
have
been
satisfied
to
rest
had
not
his
pride
and
to
some
extent
his
antagonism
prevented
his
doing
so
he
needed
money
and
would
not
use
his
wife
one
must
pay
for
old
extravagances
and
the
bills
were
coming
in
seaton
expected
call
was
an
example
ellen
was
a
widow
but
before
she
married
seaton
cartwright
knew
she
counted
him
her
lover
they
were
alike
in
temperament
rash
and
greedy
for
all
that
gave
life
a
thrill
in
fact
ellen
was
a
stimulating
comrade
but
not
the
kind
of
girl
one
married
cartwright
married
clara
and
knew
seaton
bore
him
a
lasting
grudge
since
seaton
was
a
merchant
whose
investments
in
liverpool
were
numerous
it
was
perhaps
not
strange
he
left
his
widow
shares
that
gave
her
some
control
of
the
cartwright
line
although
she
was
not
poor
she
was
greedy
and
extravagant
in
fact
cartwright
imagined
greed
was
now
her
ruling
passion
by
and
by
he
heard
steps
in
the
passage
behind
the
partition
and
thought
he
knew
the
tap
of
shoes
then
he
heard
a
laugh
and
voice
ellen
was
using
her
charm
on
his
bookkeeper
and
the
old
sport
would
play
up
the
door
opened
the
room
smelt
of
violets
and
seaton
came
in
she
was
tall
and
her
furs
gave
her
large
figure
a
touch
of
dignity
her
color
was
sharply
white
and
red
and
in
the
rather
dim
light
her
skin
was
like
a
girl
cartwright
knew
ellen
was
younger
than
he
but
not
very
much
you
look
hipped
and
rather
slack
tom
she
said
when
he
got
up
and
gavin
fetched
a
chair
i
feel
the
cold
and
damp
cartwright
replied
then
managing
a
line
when
freights
are
low
is
a
wearing
job
seaton
took
off
her
coat
your
office
is
shabby
and
climbing
all
those
stairs
is
a
pull
why
do
you
launch
out
get
a
lift
and
modernize
things
my
trouble
is
to
keep
the
boats
supplied
with
coal
and
stores
besides
you
see
i
do
often
use
my
office
for
a
you
very
cautious
seaton
remarked
with
a
laugh
you
start
to
get
on
guard
before
i
begin
my
attack
oh
well
said
cartwright
smiling
i
know
your
power
but
would
you
like
a
cigarette
she
took
the
box
he
gave
her
and
broke
the
seal
since
you
do
smoke
these
things
tom
you
were
rather
nice
to
remember
you
had
better
take
the
box
said
cartwright
i
sent
for
a
few
when
went
to
the
levant
one
understands
they
hard
to
get
in
england
but
i
have
something
else
you
like
if
you
will
wait
a
moment
he
rang
a
bell
and
gavin
entered
carrying
two
small
glasses
a
bottle
and
some
biscuits
when
he
went
out
cartwright
turned
the
bottle
so
seaton
could
see
the
label
climbing
our
stairs
is
a
fag
he
said
and
filled
the
glasses
seaton
smiled
and
took
hers
cartwright
saw
her
rings
sparkle
and
the
gleam
of
her
regular
white
teeth
the
reflection
from
the
grate
touched
her
hair
and
it
shone
a
smooth
he
admitted
with
amusement
that
ellen
was
nearly
as
attractive
as
he
had
thought
her
thirty
years
since
this
is
like
old
times
tom
she
said
i
remember
evenings
when
you
brought
me
sandwiches
and
iced
cup
at
a
dance
but
i
do
think
you
were
ever
remarkably
romantic
cartwright
remembered
an
evening
when
they
sat
under
a
shaded
lamp
in
a
quiet
corner
of
a
supper
room
listening
to
music
that
somehow
fired
one
blood
but
perhaps
it
was
the
iced
cup
he
had
generously
drunk
all
the
same
he
had
not
been
a
fool
though
he
was
tempted
he
knew
something
about
ellen
then
but
he
knew
her
better
now
perhaps
it
was
typical
that
she
had
promptly
put
the
box
of
eastern
cigarettes
in
her
muff
managing
ships
is
not
a
romantic
occupation
he
rejoined
anyway
your
welcome
kind
and
i
feel
shabby
because
i
forced
to
bother
you
but
suppose
some
of
your
customers
arrive
we
shall
not
be
disturbed
said
cartwright
smiling
gavin
knows
his
job
very
well
do
you
expect
to
declare
a
better
dividend
at
the
shareholders
meeting
i
do
not
if
i
lucky
i
may
keep
the
dividend
where
it
is
but
i
do
know
yet
two
per
cent
is
really
nothing
seaton
remarked
i
been
forced
to
study
economy
and
you
know
how
i
hate
to
pinch
besides
i
know
an
investment
that
would
give
me
eight
per
cent
then
if
you
satisfied
the
venture
is
not
risky
you
ought
to
buy
the
shares
i
want
to
buy
but
it
a
small
private
company
and
the
people
stipulate
i
must
take
a
large
block
i
have
not
enough
money
cartwright
doubted
but
her
plan
was
obvious
when
trade
is
slack
one
ought
to
be
careful
about
investing
in
a
private
company
that
pays
eight
per
cent
he
said
after
all
it
might
be
prudent
to
be
satisfied
with
a
small
profit
but
i
not
satisfied
and
your
dividend
is
remarkably
small
are
you
really
unable
to
make
it
larger
one
ca
pay
dividends
out
of
capital
anyhow
one
ca
keep
it
up
for
long
then
as
i
mean
to
make
a
plunge
i
must
sell
some
of
the
investments
that
do
earn
me
much
my
shares
in
the
line
carry
a
good
number
of
votes
and
if
people
grumble
at
the
meeting
would
give
you
some
control
will
you
buy
them
tom
cartwright
knitted
his
brows
he
thought
her
hint
about
the
shares
giving
him
useful
power
was
significant
in
fact
it
looked
as
if
somebody
had
put
ellen
on
his
track
he
wondered
whether
manners
but
she
must
not
think
him
disturbed
what
is
your
price
he
asked
my
price
she
said
with
a
puzzled
look
he
thought
well
done
of
course
i
want
the
sum
the
shares
stand
for
i
sorry
it
impossible
just
now
the
shares
of
very
few
shipping
companies
are
worth
their
face
value
for
example
shares
in
a
good
line
were
not
long
since
offered
at
two
pounds
ten
seaton
looked
disturbed
that
dreadful
she
exclaimed
but
not
rich
enough
to
bear
a
heavy
loss
and
if
you
bought
my
lot
the
voting
power
would
enable
you
to
break
the
grumblers
opposition
they
worth
more
to
you
than
anybody
else
ca
you
help
me
cartwright
gave
her
a
smiling
glance
although
he
was
bothered
ellen
was
not
a
fool
and
he
noted
her
insistence
on
the
value
of
the
shares
to
him
where
this
led
was
obvious
he
had
one
or
two
powerful
antagonists
and
knew
of
plots
to
force
his
retirement
ellen
had
given
him
his
choice
he
must
promise
a
larger
dividend
or
buy
her
shares
at
something
over
their
market
price
this
of
course
was
impossible
but
he
imagined
she
did
not
know
how
poor
he
was
i
ca
buy
he
said
i
must
trust
my
luck
and
fighting
power
although
we
have
had
stormy
meetings
and
rates
are
bad
the
line
is
running
yet
if
you
have
enough
money
why
do
you
ask
your
wife
she
rich
and
has
risked
much
of
her
capital
in
the
line
that
is
so
cartwright
agreed
ellen
meant
to
be
nasty
but
he
must
be
cool
although
my
wife
is
rich
i
do
use
her
money
you
not
logical
and
sometimes
your
fastidiousness
is
very
marked
however
it
looks
as
if
you
did
marry
because
clara
was
rich
she
was
romantic
before
she
began
to
get
fat
cartwright
face
got
red
he
had
had
enough
and
saw
ellen
was
getting
savage
she
had
not
forgotten
that
in
a
sense
he
ought
to
have
married
her
and
since
he
would
not
buy
her
shares
she
would
no
doubt
help
his
antagonists
crossing
the
floor
he
poked
the
fire
noisily
shall
i
give
you
some
more
wine
he
asked
and
while
he
was
occupied
with
the
glasses
the
telephone
bell
rang
behind
the
partition
a
few
moments
afterwards
gavin
came
in
moreton
has
rung
up
sir
if
you
can
give
him
five
minutes
he
come
across
he
says
it
important
seaton
put
on
her
coat
i
must
stop
when
an
important
customer
is
coming
then
she
laughed
and
gave
cartwright
her
hand
you
are
very
obstinate
tom
but
i
know
your
pluck
she
went
off
gavin
took
away
the
wine
and
cartwright
opened
the
window
the
smell
of
violets
vanished
but
when
he
sat
down
again
he
pondered
he
knew
seaton
and
thought
she
meant
to
hint
his
pluck
might
soon
be
needed
when
ellen
smiled
like
that
she
was
plotting
something
chapter
v
cartwright
scruples
the
at
cartwright
house
on
the
cheshire
side
of
the
mersey
was
large
and
cartwright
thought
the
stiff
thick
curtains
and
victorian
walnut
furniture
ugly
but
cartwright
liked
the
things
and
he
was
satisfied
clara
herself
frankly
belonged
to
the
old
school
she
was
conventional
and
often
dull
but
she
had
a
placid
dignity
that
did
not
mark
all
the
women
cartwright
knew
moreover
the
house
was
comfortable
one
got
there
by
the
mersey
tunnel
and
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
walk
from
the
station
for
all
that
the
encroaching
town
had
not
yet
reached
the
neighborhood
and
the
windows
commanded
a
pleasant
view
of
clean
rolling
country
and
the
blue
welsh
hills
cartwright
felt
the
house
was
a
snug
harbor
where
he
could
rest
when
he
was
too
old
and
battered
to
front
the
storms
that
had
for
some
time
been
gathering
and
sitting
by
the
fire
one
evening
he
speculated
about
the
rocks
and
shoals
ahead
all
the
same
the
time
to
run
for
shelter
was
not
yet
he
thought
he
could
ride
out
another
gale
an
arch
with
heavy
molding
occupied
the
middle
of
the
spacious
room
the
folding
doors
had
been
removed
and
curtains
partly
screened
the
arch
on
the
other
side
a
group
of
young
men
and
women
stood
about
the
piano
on
cartwright
side
the
lights
were
low
he
had
dined
well
and
liked
to
loaf
after
dinner
besides
he
felt
dull
his
gout
bothered
him
and
he
had
been
forced
to
run
for
his
train
he
had
begun
to
find
out
one
could
not
do
that
kind
of
thing
cartwright
sat
opposite
knitting
quietly
and
her
smooth
rhythmic
movements
were
soothing
clara
was
never
abrupt
and
jerky
i
got
a
letter
from
stormont
by
the
afternoon
post
she
said
they
have
been
repaid
the
mortgage
and
there
something
about
a
foreign
bond
drawn
for
redemption
they
want
to
talk
about
a
new
investment
stormont
wilmot
and
stormont
were
her
lawyers
and
cartwright
nodded
the
money
ought
to
be
earning
interest
and
you
can
safely
buy
stock
stormont
approve
their
judgment
sound
for
all
that
i
think
i
like
to
choose
for
myself
suppose
i
bought
some
shares
in
the
line
i
have
a
number
but
it
really
not
large
and
i
have
felt
i
not
supporting
the
house
as
i
ought
cartwright
knitted
his
brows
clara
did
not
know
much
about
business
but
she
was
sometimes
shrewder
than
one
thought
he
wondered
whether
mortimer
had
been
talking
if
the
pup
had
talked
the
thing
was
ominous
because
it
implied
that
others
knew
the
difficulties
cartwright
might
have
to
meet
do
you
imagine
the
house
needs
supporting
he
asked
carelessly
cartwright
hesitated
i
really
know
nothing
about
it
but
people
grumble
when
you
ca
pay
them
much
and
their
shares
go
down
perhaps
if
the
family
owned
a
good
part
of
the
capital
you
could
take
a
firmer
line
it
was
plain
that
clara
had
been
pondering
mortimer
talked
and
somebody
who
was
not
cartwright
friend
had
informed
him
cartwright
was
tempted
to
let
his
wife
do
as
she
wanted
clara
owned
shares
in
the
line
that
he
had
let
her
buy
when
freights
were
good
and
she
had
afterwards
refused
to
sell
now
however
freights
were
very
bad
and
the
company
was
nearer
the
rocks
than
he
hoped
the
shareholders
knew
cartwright
imagined
he
could
yet
mend
its
fortunes
if
he
were
left
alone
but
the
job
was
awkward
and
opposition
might
be
dangerous
to
command
a
solid
block
of
votes
would
certainly
help
for
all
that
there
was
a
risk
clara
ought
not
to
run
his
antagonists
were
getting
stronger
and
if
they
meddled
and
baffled
him
the
company
would
fail
its
bankruptcy
would
not
ruin
his
wife
but
she
would
feel
the
loss
of
her
money
and
he
was
not
going
to
use
clara
for
a
shield
against
ellen
seaton
attacks
the
thing
was
shabby
all
the
same
the
situation
was
humorous
and
he
saw
with
an
ironical
smile
the
advantages
of
cartwright
plan
i
not
a
business
woman
but
i
have
noted
you
sometimes
moody
as
if
you
were
anxious
and
i
want
to
help
she
resumed
you
do
help
the
storms
i
weathered
have
left
a
mark
and
now
old
and
strained
it
much
to
make
a
quiet
port
at
night
you
take
all
bothers
from
me
and
send
me
out
in
the
morning
braced
for
another
watch
in
the
some
time
you
must
give
another
the
helm
said
cartwright
quietly
i
wish
i
could
persuade
you
to
do
so
soon
cartwright
sighed
for
the
strain
was
heavy
and
he
wanted
to
rest
the
trouble
was
the
reckoning
for
past
extravagance
was
at
hand
and
he
shrank
from
asking
his
wife
to
pay
he
had
not
been
very
scrupulous
but
he
had
his
code
then
hyslop
came
through
the
arch
and
stopping
noted
cartwright
awkwardly
leg
gout
bothering
you
again
sir
he
said
you
ought
to
lie
up
for
a
few
days
but
i
expect
you
needed
at
the
office
i
heard
the
line
had
a
stormy
meeting
and
the
dissatisfied
shareholders
came
near
turning
out
the
directors
johnson
declared
they
only
saved
the
situation
by
a
few
votes
they
ought
to
be
turned
out
a
blundering
lot
they
let
a
good
fleet
down
hyslop
smiled
he
had
pale
and
watery
blue
eyes
that
generally
annoyed
cartwright
an
awkward
doctrine
sir
if
all
the
steamship
directors
who
might
have
used
the
shareholders
money
to
better
advantage
were
called
to
account
i
imagine
a
number
of
respectable
gentlemen
would
find
their
occupation
gone
besides
when
people
start
deposing
rulers
they
do
know
where
to
stop
the
thing
so
to
speak
contagious
and
panicky
investors
are
not
logical
he
went
off
and
cartwright
braced
himself
mortimer
meant
to
be
nasty
but
his
languid
malice
bit
deeper
than
he
knew
cartwright
had
hesitated
weighing
the
value
of
his
wife
help
against
his
scruples
until
his
hints
had
tipped
the
beam
after
all
if
he
used
clara
money
and
saved
his
skin
at
her
cost
the
pup
would
have
some
grounds
to
sneer
i
must
keep
control
for
some
time
yet
he
said
times
are
bad
and
if
i
let
go
the
helm
i
doubt
if
my
successor
could
steer
a
safe
course
when
the
need
is
gone
i
willingly
give
up
but
i
must
bring
the
old
ship
into
port
first
in
the
meantime
you
had
better
let
stormont
buy
you
sound
corporation
stock
cartwright
acquiesced
and
cartwright
watched
the
young
people
beyond
the
arch
with
the
stiff
curtains
for
and
the
lights
concealed
the
end
of
the
room
made
a
proscenium
it
was
like
looking
at
a
comedy
on
the
stage
two
of
the
girls
were
pretty
and
he
approved
their
fashionable
clothes
when
she
was
quiet
grace
was
almost
beautiful
but
somehow
none
had
barbara
charm
yet
cartwright
thought
the
girl
was
getting
thin
and
her
color
was
too
bright
a
friend
of
mortimer
occupied
the
music
stool
and
cartwright
admitted
that
the
fellow
played
well
although
he
was
something
like
a
character
from
a
gilbert
opera
lister
sat
near
the
piano
and
talked
to
barbara
he
smiled
but
his
smile
had
a
touch
of
gravity
cartwright
thought
him
a
good
canadian
a
bit
rugged
perhaps
but
staunch
and
his
quiet
sincerity
was
after
all
better
style
than
the
cleverness
of
mortimer
friends
cartwright
imagined
barbara
studied
lister
who
did
not
know
in
fact
it
looked
as
if
he
were
puzzled
and
cartwright
smiled
lister
had
not
his
talents
when
cartwright
was
young
he
knew
how
to
amuse
a
pretty
girl
the
man
at
the
piano
signed
to
barbara
who
got
up
and
began
to
sing
the
song
was
modern
and
the
melody
not
marked
cartwright
liked
the
victorian
ballads
with
tunes
that
haunted
one
and
obvious
sentiment
but
because
barbara
sang
he
gave
the
words
and
music
his
languid
interest
after
all
the
thing
was
clever
there
was
so
to
speak
not
much
on
the
surface
but
one
heard
an
elusive
note
of
effort
as
if
one
struggled
after
something
one
could
not
grasp
on
the
whole
cartwright
did
not
approve
that
kind
of
sentiment
his
objects
were
generally
plain
then
he
thought
the
hint
of
strain
was
too
well
done
for
a
young
girl
and
when
barbara
stopped
he
turned
to
his
wife
are
you
satisfied
about
barbara
he
asked
why
should
i
not
be
satisfied
i
have
felt
she
not
quite
up
to
her
proper
form
looks
thin
and
sometimes
she
quiet
then
why
has
young
vernon
gone
off
i
seen
him
recently
harry
in
town
he
goes
home
in
a
few
days
cartwright
replied
she
hesitated
and
resumed
i
imagined
he
wanted
to
marry
barbara
although
she
told
me
nothing
about
this
barbara
does
not
tell
one
much
do
you
think
she
likes
him
i
do
know
but
i
rather
think
if
she
had
liked
him
she
would
have
refused
ah
said
cartwright
thoughtfully
well
vernon
a
good
sort
but
i
see
some
light
the
girl
is
sensitive
and
very
proud
no
doubt
she
feels
her
canadian
adventure
ridiculous
of
course
but
barbara
hard
to
move
all
the
same
if
vernon
the
proper
man
and
is
resolute
i
doubt
if
he
is
the
proper
man
cartwright
replied
cartwright
pondered
sometimes
clara
did
not
say
all
she
thought
and
his
glance
wandered
back
to
the
group
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
barbara
was
again
talking
to
lister
he
looked
thoughtful
and
her
face
was
serious
they
were
obviously
not
engaged
in
philandering
cartwright
felt
their
quiet
absorption
was
significant
after
a
minute
or
two
however
the
party
about
the
piano
broke
up
and
went
off
barbara
stopped
to
put
away
some
music
and
then
came
through
the
arch
lister
wants
to
go
a
voyage
she
said
to
cartwright
i
suggested
you
might
help
him
to
get
a
post
on
board
a
ship
i
imagine
he
did
not
suggest
you
should
persuade
me
certainly
not
he
refused
to
bother
you
barbara
replied
and
with
some
hesitation
added
however
perhaps
in
a
sense
we
ought
to
help
that
is
so
cartwright
agreed
why
did
lister
come
to
liverpool
he
wanted
to
go
round
the
shipping
offices
mother
told
him
our
house
was
always
open
cartwright
nodded
of
course
well
i
think
about
it
and
may
see
a
plan
barbara
went
off
and
cartwright
looked
at
his
wife
i
do
know
if
this
is
a
fresh
complication
but
if
she
refused
harry
she
no
doubt
refuse
the
other
perhaps
it
important
that
she
willing
he
should
go
to
sea
one
is
forced
to
like
lister
and
we
owe
him
much
cartwright
remarked
certainly
cartwright
agreed
however
it
looks
as
if
some
engineering
talent
is
all
he
has
got
and
i
think
a
long
voyage
is
indicated
he
stopped
and
resumed
with
a
twinkle
for
all
that
the
fellow
is
not
an
adventurer
and
i
married
a
rich
woman
cartwright
gave
him
a
gentle
smile
i
have
been
happy
and
barbara
is
not
but
in
one
sense
i
do
imagine
we
need
be
disturbed
barbara
has
not
recovered
from
the
jar
she
got
up
and
cartwright
dozed
until
he
heard
a
step
and
lister
crossed
the
floor
hallo
he
said
are
you
going
there
is
no
train
just
now
lister
said
he
meant
to
walk
to
the
tramline
but
cartwright
asked
him
to
stop
for
a
few
minutes
barbara
tells
me
you
are
trying
for
a
post
in
an
he
remarked
that
is
so
said
lister
with
a
touch
of
embarrassment
still
i
did
mean
miss
hyslop
to
bother
you
barbara
likes
to
meddle
and
i
a
to
begin
with
why
want
to
go
to
sea
i
must
go
to
sea
or
back
to
canada
lister
said
smiling
i
had
a
pretty
good
holiday
but
my
wad
nearly
gone
then
would
it
be
prudent
to
return
to
your
occupation
i
have
an
occupation
i
turned
mine
down
it
possible
i
find
another
but
i
not
ready
yet
in
canada
we
a
restless
wandering
lot
and
i
want
to
look
about
the
world
before
i
go
back
you
see
when
you
only
know
the
woods
and
our
western
towns
cartwright
saw
and
sympathized
he
remembered
how
adventure
called
when
he
was
young
well
he
had
got
adventure
but
perhaps
not
the
kind
lister
seemed
to
enjoy
anyhow
he
had
not
started
off
with
an
empty
wallet
to
look
about
the
world
how
much
does
your
roll
amount
to
he
asked
with
a
bluntness
he
sometimes
used
when
lister
told
him
he
laughed
the
young
fellow
was
good
stuff
cartwright
liked
his
rashness
well
he
said
you
have
pluck
and
if
you
obstinate
pluck
takes
you
far
have
you
got
a
promise
from
any
of
our
shipping
offices
lister
said
he
had
not
there
were
some
difficulties
about
certificates
he
had
sailed
on
lake
boats
and
made
coasting
voyages
but
the
english
board
of
trade
rules
were
strict
then
he
looked
at
the
clock
and
cartwright
gave
him
his
hand
come
and
see
me
at
the
office
we
talk
about
this
again
lister
thanked
him
and
when
he
had
gone
cartwright
mused
the
young
fellow
was
not
an
adventurer
anyhow
not
in
the
sense
shillito
was
an
adventurer
his
honesty
was
obvious
it
was
plain
he
did
not
want
barbara
money
and
cartwright
thought
he
did
not
know
she
was
rich
in
fact
he
was
barbara
sort
there
was
the
trouble
cartwright
weighed
this
for
a
time
and
then
went
to
sleep
chapter
vi
a
nasty
knock
frost
sparkled
on
the
office
windows
and
cartwright
with
his
feet
on
the
hearthrug
studied
an
atlantic
weather
chart
the
temperature
reported
by
the
liners
captains
was
low
and
winter
had
begun
unusually
soon
since
cartwright
had
hoped
for
a
mild
november
this
was
unlucky
as
a
rule
cargo
is
plentiful
at
montreal
shortly
before
the
lawrence
freezes
and
the
last
steamers
to
go
down
the
river
do
so
with
heavy
loads
cartwright
plan
was
to
run
a
boat
across
at
the
last
moment
and
pick
up
goods
the
liners
would
not
engage
to
carry
and
he
had
sent
because
she
was
fast
when
the
drift
ice
began
to
gather
speed
was
useful
a
cablegram
two
or
three
days
since
stated
that
she
had
sailed
and
cartwright
who
knew
the
lawrence
calculated
the
progress
she
ought
to
have
made
perhaps
he
had
cut
things
rather
fine
but
captain
davies
was
a
good
navigator
and
would
push
on
although
the
narrow
waters
below
montreal
where
the
stream
runs
fast
between
the
islands
would
be
open
lake
peter
was
freezing
and
the
liner
had
some
trouble
to
get
through
still
the
channels
were
not
yet
blocked
and
when
davies
had
passed
the
narrows
he
would
get
open
water
down
the
gorge
to
quebec
allowing
for
cautious
navigation
davies
ought
to
be
near
rimouski
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
his
passing
would
no
doubt
soon
be
telegraphed
from
the
signal
station
cartwright
admitted
that
to
get
the
message
would
be
some
relief
by
and
by
his
bookkeeper
came
in
direct
cablegram
from
davies
sir
cartwright
took
the
form
and
frowned
the
message
was
not
from
rimouski
and
ran
delayed
peter
passing
quebec
awkward
sir
gavin
remarked
sympathetically
very
awkward
said
cartwright
davies
needed
all
the
time
he
lost
it
will
be
a
near
thing
if
he
gets
out
he
picked
up
the
weather
chart
and
got
no
comfort
cable
malcolm
at
johns
you
find
questions
in
the
about
ice
and
wind
gavin
withdrew
and
cartwright
grappled
with
disturbing
thoughts
he
had
counted
on
earning
a
good
sum
and
had
engaged
a
paying
cargo
for
her
when
she
got
back
in
fact
the
two
good
runs
ought
to
have
made
the
disappointing
balance
sheet
he
must
shortly
submit
to
the
shareholders
look
a
little
better
all
the
same
there
was
no
use
in
meeting
trouble
davies
had
passed
quebec
and
if
he
made
good
progress
in
the
next
hours
one
might
begin
to
hope
below
quebec
there
were
awkward
spots
where
steamers
used
buoyed
channels
and
if
these
were
blocked
by
ice
davies
must
risk
crossing
the
shoals
if
he
got
across
the
water
was
deep
and
he
need
only
bother
about
the
floes
until
he
came
to
the
gulf
since
belle
isle
strait
was
frozen
davies
would
go
south
of
anticosti
and
out
by
the
cabot
passage
but
the
gulf
was
often
dark
with
snow
and
fog
and
one
met
the
old
greenland
ice
well
much
depended
on
the
weather
and
cartwright
went
to
get
his
lunch
the
restaurant
under
a
big
building
was
warm
and
for
a
time
cartwright
occupied
his
favorite
corner
of
the
his
tips
were
generous
and
so
long
as
he
was
punctual
the
waitress
allowed
nobody
to
use
his
chair
the
noise
of
the
traffic
in
the
street
was
softened
to
a
faint
rumble
the
electric
light
was
cleverly
shaded
and
his
big
chair
was
easy
he
got
drowsy
but
frowned
when
he
began
to
nod
the
trouble
was
he
was
often
dull
when
he
ought
to
be
keen
his
doctor
talked
about
the
advantages
of
moderation
but
when
one
got
old
one
pleasures
were
few
and
cartwright
liked
a
good
meal
at
the
luncheon
room
they
did
one
well
and
he
was
not
going
to
use
yet
by
and
by
a
merchant
he
knew
pulled
up
a
chair
opposite
very
cold
and
slippery
outside
he
remarked
i
nearly
came
down
on
the
floating
bridge
and
looked
in
for
a
drink
a
jar
shakes
a
man
who
carries
weight
what
were
you
doing
on
the
floating
bridge
cartwright
asked
i
went
to
the
stage
to
meet
some
canadian
friends
on
board
the
they
a
bad
voyage
thick
mist
down
the
lawrence
and
they
lost
a
day
cruising
about
among
the
floes
in
the
gulf
what
about
your
little
boat
i
understand
she
coming
down
river
has
she
started
rather
late
if
i
sent
her
sooner
the
would
have
knocked
me
out
cartwright
rejoined
i
have
got
nothing
but
stuff
the
liners
did
want
one
must
run
some
risks
the
other
nodded
that
is
so
when
shareholders
must
be
satisfied
well
i
expect
i
lucky
because
my
partner
a
good
sort
when
you
need
bother
about
other
folk
greediness
you
can
take
a
cautious
line
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
heard
some
of
your
people
grumbling
i
hope
your
boat
will
get
across
all
right
he
got
up
and
cartwright
pondered
if
outsiders
knew
his
shareholders
were
dissatisfied
things
were
worse
than
he
had
thought
and
he
might
expect
trouble
at
the
next
meeting
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
but
his
chair
was
deep
and
when
he
tried
to
get
up
his
leg
hurt
he
sank
back
again
gavin
knew
where
to
find
him
if
a
reply
from
johns
arrived
by
and
by
his
office
boy
carrying
a
cable
company
envelope
came
in
and
cartwright
hand
shook
when
he
opened
the
message
it
stated
that
an
easterly
gale
and
snowstorm
raged
about
the
newfoundland
coast
and
the
thermometer
was
very
low
the
gale
would
drive
the
drift
ice
up
the
gulf
and
pack
the
floes
things
looked
bad
cartwright
felt
he
ought
to
get
about
and
make
some
plans
to
meet
the
threatened
blow
but
he
did
not
see
what
he
could
do
he
sat
still
the
other
customers
had
gone
and
all
was
quiet
but
for
the
faint
rumble
of
traffic
and
soothing
throb
of
an
electric
fan
cartwright
mused
about
and
pictured
davies
sheltering
behind
the
on
his
bridge
and
trying
to
pierce
the
snow
and
the
man
half
frozen
in
the
spray
that
leaped
about
the
forecastle
was
a
wet
boat
when
she
was
loaded
deep
now
and
then
perhaps
a
buoy
loomed
in
the
tossing
flakes
one
tried
to
read
the
number
and
see
the
color
then
the
rattled
as
the
rudder
was
pulled
across
and
headed
for
another
mark
the
work
was
nervous
because
dangerous
shoals
bordered
the
channels
and
davies
must
let
the
steamer
go
he
knew
when
a
risk
must
be
run
and
the
engineer
was
staunch
the
trouble
was
boilers
were
bad
the
money
cartwright
durst
not
spend
on
repairs
would
have
been
a
good
investment
now
still
the
old
boat
was
fast
and
davies
would
drive
her
the
captain
job
would
not
be
easier
when
he
left
the
shoals
the
easterly
gale
would
send
the
floes
up
stream
cartwright
knew
the
strange
chill
one
felt
when
ice
was
about
and
the
faint
elusive
that
marked
its
edge
in
the
dark
sometimes
one
did
not
see
the
blink
until
the
floe
was
almost
at
the
bows
and
when
the
startled
cry
reached
the
bridge
one
must
trust
to
luck
and
pull
the
helm
over
quick
then
to
dodge
the
floe
might
mean
one
crashed
upon
the
next
it
was
steering
blind
but
as
a
rule
the
sailor
instinct
guided
him
right
farther
on
the
river
got
wide
and
in
thick
weather
one
saw
no
lights
davies
must
keep
and
trust
his
reckoning
while
he
rushed
her
along
for
a
thousand
miles
the
old
boat
track
was
haunted
by
dangers
against
which
one
could
not
guard
and
cartwright
thought
she
carried
his
last
chance
to
mend
his
broken
fortunes
if
she
were
wrecked
the
reckoning
he
had
long
put
off
must
be
fronted
for
when
his
embarrassments
were
known
his
antagonists
would
combine
and
try
to
pull
him
down
one
must
pay
for
one
extravagance
but
to
pay
would
break
him
and
if
he
were
broken
mortimer
would
sneer
and
grace
treat
him
with
humiliating
pity
he
would
be
their
mother
pensioner
and
to
lose
his
independence
was
hard
he
had
long
ruled
and
bullied
others
by
and
by
a
waitress
moved
some
glasses
and
cartwright
looked
up
with
a
start
the
afternoon
was
nearly
over
he
must
have
gone
to
sleep
returning
to
the
office
he
gave
his
bookkeeper
some
orders
and
then
went
to
the
station
the
pavements
were
slippery
with
frost
and
tall
buildings
with
yellow
lights
loomed
in
the
fog
cartwright
shivered
but
reflected
that
davies
fighting
the
snow
and
gale
was
no
doubt
colder
for
a
day
or
two
he
must
bear
the
suspense
and
then
if
no
cablegram
arrived
he
could
take
it
for
granted
that
had
reached
the
atlantic
after
dinner
he
sat
by
the
fire
and
smoked
while
cartwright
knitted
in
the
afternoon
i
went
to
oliver
and
met
seaton
she
said
presently
she
talked
to
me
for
some
time
at
the
beginning
i
thought
it
strange
it
pretty
obvious
that
you
do
like
her
cartwright
remarked
ellen
seaton
is
not
my
sort
but
i
understand
she
was
a
friend
of
yours
she
was
my
friend
said
cartwright
carelessly
it
long
since
and
i
rather
doubt
if
she
is
my
friend
now
then
why
did
she
buy
her
shares
in
the
line
ellen
did
not
buy
the
shares
seaton
bought
them
when
shipping
was
good
cartwright
looked
relieved
and
cartwright
resumed
all
the
same
i
do
see
her
object
for
telling
you
she
was
a
shareholder
she
wanted
to
sell
her
shares
to
me
i
knew
she
had
some
plan
when
she
crossed
the
floor
i
was
talking
to
janet
but
ellen
got
janet
away
and
persuaded
a
young
man
on
the
other
side
to
move
it
was
clever
i
think
oliver
or
anybody
else
remarked
what
she
was
doing
but
you
know
ellen
i
know
ellen
rather
well
said
cartwright
dryly
however
when
you
saw
she
wanted
to
get
you
alone
why
did
you
indulge
her
for
one
thing
i
was
curious
then
it
was
worth
while
to
spoil
her
plan
i
did
think
ellen
would
persuade
me
if
i
did
not
approve
cartwright
smiled
clara
did
not
argue
much
and
generally
agreed
with
him
but
sometimes
she
was
as
immovable
as
a
rock
he
pictured
with
amusement
the
little
comedy
at
oliver
but
all
the
same
he
was
annoyed
well
ellen
wanted
you
to
buy
her
shares
did
she
give
you
any
grounds
she
declared
she
wanted
money
then
she
said
it
would
help
you
if
i
took
the
lot
there
might
be
a
dispute
at
the
meeting
the
report
would
not
be
satisfactory
people
would
ask
awkward
questions
and
she
expected
some
organized
opposition
it
would
be
useful
for
you
to
command
a
large
number
of
votes
cartwright
face
got
red
ellen
was
well
informed
in
fact
it
was
ominous
that
she
knew
so
much
had
she
not
been
greedy
he
thought
she
would
have
kept
the
shares
in
order
to
vote
against
him
but
she
obviously
meant
to
sell
them
before
the
crash
she
expected
came
if
a
number
of
others
agreed
with
her
his
retirement
would
be
forced
what
price
were
you
to
pay
he
asked
cartwright
told
him
and
he
laughed
if
ellen
found
a
buyer
at
a
number
of
shillings
less
she
would
be
lucky
well
i
understand
you
did
take
her
offer
i
did
not
said
cartwright
tranquilly
when
i
wanted
to
buy
some
shares
not
long
since
you
did
not
approve
since
you
refused
to
let
me
help
i
did
mean
to
be
persuaded
by
ellen
seaton
you
staunch
said
cartwright
and
cartwright
resumed
her
knitting
in
the
morning
he
went
to
the
office
sooner
than
usual
but
there
was
no
news
and
the
dark
cold
day
passed
drearily
when
he
started
for
home
gavin
promised
to
wait
until
the
cable
offices
closed
and
cartwright
had
gone
to
dinner
when
he
was
called
to
the
telephone
when
he
took
down
the
instrument
his
hand
shook
hallo
he
said
hoarsely
is
that
you
gavin
yes
sir
said
a
voice
he
knew
cablegram
from
davies
just
arrived
part
in
code
i
give
it
you
slow
go
on
said
cartwright
ashore
east
cape
chat
surrounded
ice
water
in
fore
hold
think
some
plates
broken
have
abandoned
ship
salvage
impossible
until
ice
breaks
there
was
a
pause
and
gavin
added
that
all
have
you
got
it
sir
i
got
enough
cartwright
replied
he
hung
up
the
instrument
and
going
back
to
the
drained
his
glass
then
he
turned
to
cartwright
who
had
remarked
his
grim
look
i
got
a
nasty
knock
in
the
ice
and
may
be
wrecked
anyhow
we
ca
get
her
off
until
spring
and
she
the
best
of
the
fleet
cartwright
gave
him
a
sympathetic
glance
and
signed
a
servant
to
bring
another
plate
as
a
rule
she
did
not
say
much
she
studied
her
husband
quietly
and
was
not
much
comforted
when
he
resumed
his
dinner
this
was
characteristic
but
it
was
plain
he
had
got
a
nasty
knock
chapter
vii
the
shareholders
meeting
the
afternoon
was
dark
and
electric
lights
burned
along
the
cornice
of
the
room
engaged
for
the
shareholders
meeting
the
room
was
big
and
cold
and
as
gavin
moved
about
the
table
on
the
platform
his
steps
echoed
hollowly
he
was
the
company
secretary
and
was
putting
down
papers
by
the
blotting
pads
a
group
of
gentlemen
engaged
in
thoughtful
talk
stood
by
the
fire
they
were
directors
of
the
line
and
did
not
look
happy
nominally
by
the
company
constitution
the
shareholders
elected
the
board
in
practice
cartwright
had
so
far
appointed
the
directors
and
meant
if
possible
to
do
so
again
the
gentlemen
by
the
fire
were
eligible
for
reëlection
and
cartwright
was
satisfied
although
he
had
not
chosen
them
for
their
business
talent
their
names
were
good
in
liverpool
and
their
honesty
was
known
cartwright
did
not
want
clever
men
he
was
head
of
the
house
and
knew
it
would
totter
to
a
disastrous
fall
unless
he
kept
his
firm
control
now
and
then
gavin
gave
his
employer
a
keen
glance
cartwright
lips
were
rather
blue
and
the
lines
round
his
eyes
were
sharply
drawn
his
white
mustache
stuck
out
and
one
got
a
hint
of
stubbornness
but
except
for
this
his
face
was
inscrutable
although
gavin
thought
cartwright
would
score
again
he
was
anxious
nobody
but
cartwright
could
persuade
the
dissatisfied
shareholders
to
accept
balance
sheet
cartwright
himself
felt
in
rather
good
form
he
had
curtailed
his
lunch
and
been
satisfied
with
a
single
glass
of
liquor
that
generally
braced
him
up
he
imagined
he
would
need
all
his
skill
and
coolness
before
the
meeting
was
over
the
trouble
was
he
might
not
get
much
support
the
directors
did
not
know
all
he
knew
but
they
knew
something
and
he
saw
one
or
two
hesitated
then
cartwright
was
ill
and
although
she
had
given
her
husband
her
proxy
votes
had
sent
mortimer
mortimer
was
entitled
to
come
because
he
had
some
shares
but
cartwright
did
not
know
the
line
he
meant
to
take
the
pup
did
not
like
him
and
was
cunning
presently
cartwright
looked
at
his
watch
they
wo
be
long
i
imagine
we
are
going
to
have
some
opposition
it
very
possible
one
of
the
others
agreed
a
dividend
is
disappointing
and
we
are
paying
this
by
cutting
down
the
reserve
fund
then
people
know
we
have
lost
the
use
of
our
best
boat
for
six
months
and
may
lose
her
for
good
when
we
reduced
our
insurance
i
urged
that
we
were
rash
we
saved
a
good
sum
and
economy
was
needful
cartwright
rejoined
insurance
is
expensive
for
our
type
of
boats
the
balance
sheet
looks
bad
i
admit
i
sooner
not
be
accountable
for
a
state
of
things
like
this
another
remarked
cartwright
smiled
the
balance
sheet
looked
better
than
it
was
but
jordan
had
given
him
a
useful
lead
he
knew
his
colleagues
weaknesses
and
how
they
might
be
worked
upon
we
are
all
accountable
i
have
consulted
you
frankly
and
you
approved
my
plans
jordan
gave
him
a
rather
doubtful
look
anyhow
we
must
front
an
awkward
situation
suppose
the
shareholders
ask
for
an
investigation
committee
we
must
refuse
said
cartwright
with
quiet
firmness
a
frightened
committee
would
probably
urge
a
drastic
scheme
the
writing
off
much
of
our
capital
and
perhaps
winding
up
the
line
when
rates
are
bad
and
cargo
scarce
one
must
take
a
low
price
for
ships
our
liabilities
are
large
and
i
imagine
selling
off
would
leave
us
much
in
debt
cartwright
paused
he
saw
his
remarks
carried
weight
and
knew
his
he
would
give
them
a
few
moments
for
thought
before
he
finished
his
argument
very
well
he
resumed
jordan
declares
he
does
not
like
to
be
accountable
for
an
unsatisfactory
balance
sheet
i
take
it
he
would
much
less
like
to
be
made
accountable
for
a
bad
bankruptcy
no
doubt
you
sympathize
with
him
it
was
obvious
that
they
did
so
and
one
said
if
i
thought
my
occupying
a
seat
on
the
board
would
lead
to
this
i
would
sooner
have
given
my
shares
away
i
have
not
talked
about
my
feelings
cartwright
went
on
all
the
same
i
am
head
of
the
old
house
you
can
imagine
i
do
not
want
to
see
it
fall
but
rates
are
not
always
low
and
if
i
not
embarrassed
by
rash
meddlers
my
persuasion
is
i
can
keep
the
fleet
running
until
better
times
arrive
he
saw
he
had
won
them
the
number
of
shares
they
owned
was
not
very
large
for
the
most
part
the
men
were
rich
and
not
disturbed
about
their
money
they
valued
a
high
place
in
business
and
social
circles
and
their
good
name
to
be
entangled
by
a
bankruptcy
was
unthinkable
then
i
feel
we
ought
to
support
you
jordan
replied
for
all
that
our
power
not
very
great
we
are
going
to
meet
some
opposition
and
if
the
dissatisfied
people
are
resolute
they
can
turn
us
out
so
long
as
i
know
the
board
will
back
me
i
not
afraid
of
the
shareholders
cartwright
declared
you
imagine
you
can
save
the
situation
a
gentleman
remarked
it
possible
said
cartwright
dryly
very
well
said
the
other
we
must
try
to
see
you
out
they
went
to
the
table
soon
afterwards
and
the
shareholders
began
to
arrive
they
were
not
numerous
and
the
scattered
groups
emphasized
the
bareness
of
the
big
echoing
room
cartwright
studied
the
people
as
they
came
in
some
looked
gloomy
and
some
stubborn
a
few
looked
frankly
bored
there
were
five
or
six
women
and
two
whispered
while
the
others
glanced
about
with
jerky
movements
cartwright
face
hardened
when
he
saw
seaton
and
then
he
noted
hyslop
in
a
back
row
he
thought
hyslop
looked
languidly
amused
when
all
was
quiet
he
took
the
notes
gavin
handed
him
glanced
at
the
paper
and
put
it
down
then
speaking
in
a
steady
voice
he
gave
the
report
of
the
year
work
and
talked
about
the
balance
sheet
he
was
frank
but
not
apologetic
and
claimed
in
view
of
the
difficulties
that
the
directors
had
well
guarded
the
company
interests
when
he
stopped
there
were
murmurs
of
approval
as
if
some
of
the
despondent
had
begun
to
hope
the
cautious
admitted
that
cartwright
had
made
a
bad
situation
look
better
one
or
two
asked
questions
which
he
answered
candidly
and
then
there
was
a
pause
and
somebody
moved
the
adoption
of
the
chairman
report
and
balance
sheet
his
seconder
made
a
short
nervous
speech
and
seaton
got
up
at
the
end
of
the
room
she
pushed
back
her
veil
took
out
her
handkerchief
put
her
hand
on
a
chair
in
front
and
gave
the
directors
an
apologetic
smile
i
do
know
if
it
is
usual
for
a
woman
to
speak
at
a
business
meeting
but
i
have
a
number
of
shares
in
the
line
and
it
long
since
i
got
a
good
dividend
she
said
two
per
cent
is
ridiculous
and
my
lawyer
tells
me
i
could
get
four
per
cent
where
the
security
is
really
good
she
paused
and
added
naïvely
to
have
twice
as
much
to
spend
would
be
very
nice
somebody
laughed
and
cartwright
braced
himself
ellen
seaton
was
cleverer
than
she
looked
and
he
thought
her
dangerous
but
in
the
meantime
he
durst
not
stop
her
one
feels
that
security
important
and
it
plain
ours
is
not
she
resumed
well
i
suppose
if
we
accept
the
report
it
means
we
are
satisfied
to
let
the
company
business
be
managed
on
the
old
plan
it
does
mean
something
like
that
a
man
agreed
then
i
satisfied
for
one
thing
i
want
a
proper
dividend
we
all
want
a
proper
dividend
somebody
remarked
seaton
smiled
as
if
she
were
encouraged
to
go
without
is
disappointing
but
perhaps
the
dividend
is
not
most
important
i
like
to
feel
my
shares
were
worth
the
money
they
cost
and
find
out
they
are
not
we
have
drawn
on
the
reserves
and
i
expect
this
implies
we
are
losing
money
you
ca
go
on
losing
money
very
long
and
we
ought
to
stop
while
we
have
some
capital
left
a
number
of
the
others
applauded
and
she
continued
our
directors
have
worked
very
hard
to
manage
ships
that
do
pay
must
be
tiring
and
perhaps
we
ought
to
ask
them
to
bear
the
heavy
strain
could
we
not
choose
somebody
with
fresh
ideas
to
help
that
what
we
want
said
one
the
board
needs
new
blood
then
the
storm
broke
and
for
a
time
cartwright
lost
control
of
the
meeting
seaton
had
loosed
passions
he
might
have
restrained
and
the
shareholders
were
frankly
moved
by
fear
distrust
and
greed
men
got
up
asking
angry
questions
and
shouting
implications
but
for
a
few
minutes
cartwright
sat
like
a
rock
and
let
them
rage
when
they
stopped
and
there
was
an
awkward
pause
mortimer
hyslop
got
up
he
looked
languid
and
his
voice
was
soft
but
cartwright
admitted
his
speech
was
clever
he
and
cartwright
whom
he
represented
owned
shares
in
the
line
and
he
had
not
risen
before
because
the
chairman
was
his
relation
now
when
attacks
perhaps
not
altogether
justified
had
been
made
on
the
board
he
was
forced
to
state
his
conviction
that
nobody
else
could
have
steered
the
company
past
the
dangers
that
threatened
one
must
admit
the
situation
was
bad
and
for
a
minute
or
two
mortimer
cleverly
indicated
its
drawbacks
for
all
that
he
argued
it
was
rash
to
change
pilot
and
officers
in
the
middle
of
a
storm
the
officers
they
knew
and
had
trusted
must
be
left
control
until
the
gale
blew
over
mortimer
sat
down
and
cartwright
knitted
his
brows
on
the
surface
his
had
taken
the
proper
line
mortimer
meant
to
support
the
board
but
he
had
indicated
that
he
did
so
because
it
was
his
duty
his
remarks
about
the
dangers
by
which
the
company
was
surrounded
had
made
things
look
worse
all
the
same
he
had
calmed
the
meeting
but
cartwright
did
not
know
if
this
was
an
advantage
criticism
was
harder
to
meet
when
the
critics
were
cool
another
man
got
up
and
began
to
talk
in
a
quiet
voice
hyslop
has
an
object
for
trusting
the
chairman
that
we
have
not
got
we
wo
grumble
about
his
staunchness
but
we
are
entitled
to
weigh
his
arguments
which
are
not
altogether
sound
he
owns
the
situation
is
awkward
and
the
outlook
dark
but
he
urges
us
to
trust
the
officers
who
got
the
ship
in
danger
one
feels
this
is
not
remarkably
logical
then
he
declares
nobody
else
could
have
kept
the
fleet
running
i
think
the
claim
is
rash
in
this
city
we
are
conservative
and
names
long
known
in
business
circles
carry
an
exaggerated
weight
we
expect
a
man
to
work
wonders
because
his
father
started
a
prosperous
line
and
another
because
he
long
since
made
a
lucky
plunge
men
like
these
are
often
satisfied
with
former
triumphs
while
times
and
methods
change
we
want
fresh
thought
and
modern
methods
it
obvious
the
old
have
brought
us
near
the
rocks
cartwright
saw
the
shareholders
were
moved
and
the
time
for
him
to
speak
had
come
he
got
up
and
fronted
a
doubting
and
antagonistic
audience
his
face
was
inscrutable
but
he
looked
dignified
we
have
heard
angry
criticism
and
hints
about
slackness
he
began
some
of
you
have
suggested
rejecting
the
report
a
committee
of
inquiry
and
new
members
for
the
board
but
no
substantive
motion
has
been
put
well
before
this
is
done
i
claim
your
patience
for
a
few
minutes
if
you
are
not
satisfied
i
and
your
directors
are
jointly
accountable
we
stand
together
if
you
get
rid
of
one
you
get
rid
of
all
this
is
a
drastic
but
risky
cure
he
paused
and
one
or
two
of
the
gentlemen
at
the
table
looked
surprised
it
was
plain
they
felt
the
chairman
had
gone
farther
than
he
ought
the
man
however
smiled
as
if
he
approved
and
cartwright
resumed
times
are
bad
the
markets
are
flat
and
goods
are
not
moved
about
the
world
i
venture
to
state
no
steamship
company
is
free
from
embarrassments
you
can
no
doubt
find
men
with
business
talent
equal
to
ours
and
give
them
control
but
you
can
not
give
them
the
knowledge
gained
by
long
experience
one
needs
to
grapple
with
the
particular
difficulties
the
cartwright
line
must
meet
the
personal
touch
is
needed
your
manager
must
be
known
by
the
company
friends
and
its
antagonists
who
would
not
hesitate
to
snatch
our
trade
from
a
stranger
they
know
me
and
the
others
and
are
cautious
about
attacking
us
in
all
that
important
until
times
get
better
am
the
cartwright
stopped
and
drank
some
water
he
saw
he
had
struck
the
right
note
and
began
again
i
will
not
labor
the
argument
the
thing
is
obvious
if
i
go
the
line
will
stop
running
before
the
new
men
learn
their
job
well
i
old
and
tired
but
it
would
hurt
to
see
the
hauled
down
it
was
carried
by
famous
oak
clippers
in
my
grandfather
time
you
hesitate
to
risk
your
money
i
risk
mine
and
much
that
money
can
not
buy
the
honor
of
a
house
whose
ships
have
sailed
from
liverpool
for
a
hundred
years
the
shareholders
were
moved
and
one
heard
murmurs
of
sympathy
boldness
paid
and
cartwright
saw
he
was
recovering
his
shaken
power
but
it
was
not
all
good
acting
to
some
extent
he
was
sincere
he
got
his
breath
and
resumed
i
do
urge
you
with
a
selfish
object
to
let
me
keep
my
post
i
be
relieved
to
let
it
go
counted
in
money
the
reward
for
my
labor
is
not
large
i
want
to
save
the
cartwright
line
to
pilot
it
into
port
and
if
there
is
no
rash
meddling
i
believe
i
can
but
i
warn
you
the
thing
is
in
no
other
power
well
i
have
finished
you
must
choose
whether
your
directors
go
or
not
there
was
an
awkward
silence
and
then
somebody
asked
will
the
chairman
state
if
he
has
a
plan
for
meeting
a
situation
he
admits
is
difficult
cartwright
smiled
rather
grimly
i
will
not
make
a
public
statement
that
might
be
useful
to
our
antagonists
so
long
as
i
am
chairman
you
must
trust
me
my
proposition
is
give
us
six
months
and
then
if
things
are
no
better
we
will
welcome
a
committee
of
inquiry
in
the
meantime
a
motion
is
before
the
meeting
it
is
proposed
and
seconded
that
the
directors
report
and
balance
sheet
be
accepted
gavin
remarked
the
resolution
was
carried
the
directors
were
reelected
and
the
meeting
broke
up
cartwright
sat
down
rather
limply
and
wiped
his
face
i
pulled
it
off
but
they
pushed
me
hard
he
said
at
one
time
it
looked
as
if
our
defenses
would
go
down
you
have
put
off
the
reckoning
i
think
that
all
one
of
the
directors
remarked
we
have
six
months
said
cartwright
this
is
something
if
they
call
a
meeting
then
i
imagine
i
can
meet
them
he
signed
to
gavin
who
helped
him
with
his
big
coat
and
went
off
to
the
underground
restaurant
where
he
presently
fell
asleep
in
a
chair
by
the
fire
chapter
viii
a
stolen
excursion
barbara
stopped
at
the
top
of
james
street
and
looked
down
hill
to
the
river
the
afternoon
was
dark
and
the
pavement
wet
thin
fog
drifted
about
the
tall
offices
lights
shone
in
the
windows
and
she
heard
steamers
whistles
down
the
street
a
white
plume
of
steam
streaking
the
fog
marked
the
tunnel
station
and
barbara
glanced
at
a
neighboring
clock
she
could
get
a
train
in
a
few
minutes
but
she
would
be
forced
to
wait
at
a
station
on
the
cheshire
side
and
there
was
not
another
train
for
some
time
she
had
bought
the
things
she
needed
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
one
could
pass
half
an
hour
at
a
café
but
cartwright
did
not
like
her
to
go
to
a
café
alone
and
barbara
frowned
impatiently
her
mother
was
horribly
conventional
and
barbara
missed
the
freedom
she
had
enjoyed
in
canada
in
fact
it
was
very
dull
at
home
grace
correct
serenity
and
cold
disapproval
made
one
savage
mortimer
very
proper
friends
were
tiresome
barbara
was
restless
and
dissatisfied
she
wanted
to
play
an
active
part
and
feel
she
was
alive
moreover
since
she
came
home
she
had
felt
she
was
being
watched
and
so
to
speak
protected
from
herself
her
relations
had
forgiven
her
canadian
escapade
but
they
meant
to
guard
against
her
doing
something
of
the
kind
again
perhaps
from
their
point
of
view
they
were
justified
but
barbara
was
not
tempted
to
make
a
fresh
experiment
she
had
not
yet
got
over
the
shock
she
saw
how
near
her
romantic
trustfulness
had
brought
her
to
disaster
and
thought
her
faith
in
men
and
women
had
gone
this
was
perhaps
the
worst
because
she
was
generous
and
had
frankly
trusted
people
she
liked
now
she
imagined
the
gloomy
day
had
on
her
spirits
she
was
moody
and
longed
for
something
that
would
banish
the
dreariness
starting
down
hill
for
the
station
she
stopped
abruptly
a
few
moments
afterwards
lister
was
crossing
the
street
and
if
she
went
on
they
would
meet
it
was
some
time
since
she
had
seen
him
and
she
noted
with
surprise
that
he
wore
a
rather
soiled
blue
uniform
his
cap
which
had
a
badge
in
front
was
greasy
and
he
carried
an
oilskin
coat
he
walked
quickly
looking
straight
in
front
with
his
head
well
up
and
barbara
got
a
hint
of
purposeful
activity
barbara
liked
him
much
but
she
had
as
a
rule
quietly
baffled
his
efforts
to
know
her
better
she
waited
rather
hoping
he
would
pass
until
he
looked
round
and
advanced
to
meet
her
i
lucky
he
remarked
and
his
satisfaction
was
comforting
long
since
i
have
seen
you
you
know
our
house
barbara
rejoined
oh
well
he
said
with
a
twinkle
when
i
last
came
you
talked
to
me
for
about
two
minutes
and
then
left
me
to
play
billiards
with
your
brother
he
was
polite
but
in
canada
we
play
pool
and
my
game
not
very
good
i
imagined
he
was
bored
mortimer
is
like
that
said
barbara
but
why
are
you
wearing
the
steamship
badge
and
sailor
clothes
lister
laughed
they
engineer
clothes
i
go
to
sea
that
another
reason
i
did
come
over
ah
said
barbara
did
my
get
you
a
post
on
board
ship
he
did
not
he
told
me
to
look
him
up
at
the
office
but
i
did
go
one
would
sooner
not
bother
one
friends
canadians
are
an
independent
lot
barbara
remarked
in
this
country
we
use
our
friends
for
all
they
are
worth
and
we
justified
so
long
as
they
want
to
help
if
cartwright
said
he
would
help
he
meant
to
do
so
but
what
ship
are
you
on
board
cattle
boat
she
unloading
irish
steers
sheep
and
pigs
not
far
off
will
you
come
and
see
her
i
do
suppose
you
been
on
board
a
noah
ark
before
barbara
did
not
hesitate
she
doubted
if
cartwright
would
approve
and
knew
grace
would
not
but
this
was
not
important
grace
disapproved
all
she
did
and
the
stolen
excursion
would
break
the
monotony
then
lister
twinkling
smile
appealed
and
somehow
her
reserve
vanished
when
she
was
out
of
doors
with
him
i
like
to
go
she
said
then
come
along
he
urged
and
they
started
for
the
elevated
railway
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
while
the
electric
cars
rolled
along
the
docks
barbara
moodiness
went
she
could
not
see
much
in
the
fog
wet
warehouse
roofs
masts
and
funnels
and
hulls
floating
on
dull
water
loomed
up
and
vanished
inside
the
car
lights
glimmered
on
polished
wood
the
rattling
and
shaking
were
somehow
cheerful
barbara
felt
braced
and
alert
lister
talked
and
she
laughed
she
could
not
hear
all
he
said
because
of
the
noise
and
thought
he
did
not
hear
her
but
she
did
not
mind
she
liked
his
cheerfulness
and
frank
satisfaction
the
gloom
outside
and
the
blurred
lights
in
the
fog
gave
the
excursion
a
touch
of
romantic
adventure
they
got
down
at
a
station
by
a
muddy
ponderous
lorries
with
giant
horses
rolled
out
of
the
gloom
between
stacks
of
goods
wet
cattle
were
entangled
in
the
press
of
traffic
and
barbara
was
relieved
when
lister
pushed
back
a
sliding
door
then
she
stopped
for
a
moment
half
daunted
by
the
noise
and
bustle
and
looked
about
big
lights
hung
from
the
room
of
the
long
shed
but
did
not
pierce
the
gloom
that
lurked
between
the
piles
of
cargo
a
flock
of
sheep
moving
in
a
dense
woolly
mass
came
down
a
gangway
squealing
pigs
occupied
a
bay
across
the
piles
of
goods
the
front
of
the
shed
was
open
and
in
places
one
saw
a
faint
reflection
that
looked
like
water
opposite
barbara
the
gap
between
the
low
roof
and
was
filled
by
a
deckhouse
and
a
steamer
funnel
steam
blew
across
the
opening
farther
on
and
in
the
vapor
bales
and
boxes
shot
up
and
rattling
chains
plunged
down
through
the
roar
of
the
winches
she
heard
coarse
shouts
and
the
bellowing
of
cattle
lister
took
her
to
a
slanting
plank
that
spanned
a
dark
gulf
and
she
saw
dim
water
and
then
the
hollow
of
a
steamer
hold
men
who
looked
like
ghosts
moved
in
the
gloom
and
indistinct
cattle
came
up
a
railed
plank
barbara
could
not
see
where
they
came
from
they
plunged
out
of
the
dark
their
horns
glimmering
in
the
beam
of
the
lamps
after
a
few
moments
lister
helped
her
down
on
the
steamer
the
boat
listed
away
from
the
wall
her
tall
red
funnel
was
inclined
sharply
much
of
her
side
was
above
water
and
muddy
streams
poured
from
the
scuppers
on
the
after
deck
where
men
with
long
boots
pulled
a
about
the
boat
was
horribly
dirty
but
her
lean
bows
and
the
length
of
the
iron
casing
indicated
speed
a
man
came
along
the
and
barbara
thought
the
gold
bands
on
his
cap
indicated
the
captain
he
stopped
and
when
he
glanced
at
lister
she
blushed
for
there
was
a
hint
of
sympathetic
understanding
in
her
smile
we
wo
want
you
until
he
said
and
went
off
barbara
hoped
lister
had
not
seen
her
blush
and
thought
he
had
not
he
took
her
down
some
iron
steps
and
to
a
door
in
a
dark
passage
our
he
said
i
expect
it
the
quietest
spot
on
board
the
ship
he
pushed
the
door
open
and
stopped
the
small
room
was
bright
with
electric
light
and
a
young
man
and
woman
sat
opposite
each
other
at
the
table
the
man
uniform
was
stained
by
oil
the
girl
was
pretty
and
fashionably
dressed
but
barbara
knew
her
clothes
were
cheap
she
stood
at
the
door
hesitating
and
the
man
gave
lister
a
smile
like
the
captain
i
did
expect
you
yet
but
come
in
he
said
the
tea
not
cold
and
mike
has
made
some
doughnuts
robertson
my
chief
lister
said
to
barbara
and
the
man
presented
lister
to
his
companion
and
put
a
machine
in
a
box
on
the
floor
now
there
room
i
was
pulling
out
the
indicator
diagrams
he
added
wo
you
take
off
your
coat
miss
hyslop
and
try
mike
doughnuts
the
little
room
was
hot
and
when
barbara
hung
up
her
furs
she
noted
the
other
girl
appraising
glance
miss
grant
poured
some
black
tea
from
a
big
cracked
pot
and
pushed
across
a
tin
of
condensed
milk
and
a
plate
of
greasy
buns
when
barbara
picked
one
up
and
looked
at
it
doubtfully
robertson
opened
a
drawer
we
pull
ours
in
two
but
i
expect
you
like
a
knife
he
said
he
found
a
knife
which
he
rubbed
on
the
i
used
the
thing
on
the
indicator
the
contraption
in
the
box
but
i
think
it
clean
enough
barbara
ate
her
doughnut
and
drank
the
bitter
tea
miss
grant
looked
friendly
and
she
liked
the
engineer
they
were
frank
human
people
and
she
thought
them
kind
robertson
began
to
talk
about
carpets
and
pans
and
miss
grant
told
barbara
what
the
articles
cost
they
had
been
buying
furniture
and
robertson
stated
they
were
to
be
married
soon
i
reckon
you
have
got
so
far
yet
he
said
to
lister
and
when
barbara
saw
miss
grant
touch
him
she
blushed
it
was
ridiculous
but
the
blood
came
to
her
skin
and
then
noting
lister
embarrassment
she
began
to
laugh
jim
talk
like
that
miss
grant
remarked
oh
well
said
robertson
i
expect
it
rather
soon
lister
has
joined
us
long
and
you
do
begin
at
the
top
he
turned
to
barbara
with
an
encouraging
smile
all
the
same
he
knows
his
job
and
has
got
one
move
up
perhaps
if
he
sticks
to
it
for
a
year
or
two
miss
grant
stopped
him
and
asked
barbara
views
about
curtains
she
had
some
patterns
and
while
they
contrasted
the
material
and
the
prices
the
door
opened
and
a
greasy
fellow
gave
the
group
a
benevolent
grin
was
thim
doughnuts
all
right
he
inquired
i
had
better
but
you
made
some
worse
mike
robertson
replied
yez
said
for
if
ye
told
me
it
was
a
party
i
have
been
afther
stealing
the
captain
cork
butter
a
cook
can
not
do
his
best
whin
the
sends
him
annyhow
whin
young
an
romantic
what
it
mather
what
ye
ate
he
went
off
and
robertson
began
to
talk
about
he
was
naïvely
proud
of
the
boat
and
his
engines
and
narrated
hard
runs
in
bad
weather
to
land
the
livestock
in
time
for
important
markets
sometimes
the
hollow
that
buried
the
plunging
forecastle
filled
the
decks
and
icy
cataracts
came
down
the
stokehold
gratings
sometimes
the
cattle
pens
broke
and
mangled
bullocks
rolled
about
in
the
water
and
wreckage
robertson
had
a
talent
for
narrative
and
barbara
felt
something
of
the
terror
and
lure
of
the
sea
she
liked
the
rather
grimy
crew
their
cheerfulness
and
rude
they
did
useful
things
big
things
now
and
then
they
were
strong
fellows
not
polished
loafers
like
mortimer
friends
then
she
approved
miss
frank
pride
in
her
lover
there
was
something
primitive
about
these
people
they
were
so
to
speak
human
and
not
ashamed
of
their
humanity
lister
was
somehow
like
them
she
wondered
whether
this
had
attracted
her
perhaps
she
was
attracted
but
the
attraction
must
not
be
indulged
by
and
by
miss
grant
resumed
her
talk
about
curtains
and
when
they
had
agreed
about
the
material
that
ought
to
wear
best
barbara
looked
at
her
watch
miss
grant
gave
her
her
hand
and
robertson
declared
she
must
come
back
when
the
boat
was
in
port
again
lister
took
her
down
the
gangway
and
was
quiet
until
they
reached
the
station
then
he
smiled
apologetically
you
played
up
well
i
did
know
robertson
was
on
board
but
he
a
very
good
sort
so
the
girl
i
think
barbara
laughed
i
did
play
up
i
liked
the
people
the
excursion
was
delightful
i
enjoyed
it
all
lister
saw
she
was
sincere
and
thrilled
he
had
begun
to
think
he
ought
not
to
have
suggested
the
adventure
but
he
was
not
sorry
now
barbara
was
not
bothered
by
ridiculous
conventions
she
talked
gayly
while
the
cars
rolled
along
beside
the
warehouse
walls
but
when
they
got
down
at
the
station
she
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
cartwright
had
alighted
from
the
next
car
and
was
a
yard
or
two
in
front
lister
knew
his
fur
coat
and
rather
dragging
walk
if
he
and
barbara
went
on
they
would
confront
cartwright
when
he
turned
to
go
down
the
steps
barbara
gave
him
a
twinkling
glance
and
remarked
that
he
knitted
his
brows
but
did
not
hesitate
in
the
few
moments
since
her
left
the
train
she
had
seen
three
or
four
plans
for
avoiding
him
lister
obviously
had
not
and
on
the
whole
she
approved
his
honesty
he
advanced
and
touched
cartwright
i
did
know
you
were
on
board
our
train
sir
cartwright
looked
at
him
rather
hard
and
barbara
waited
although
she
had
been
caught
enjoying
a
stolen
excursion
she
was
not
afraid
of
her
but
she
was
curious
i
was
in
front
said
cartwright
dryly
barbara
has
picked
a
rather
dreary
day
for
a
run
to
the
north
docks
i
understood
she
was
going
to
the
shops
miss
hyslop
met
me
near
the
station
and
i
persuaded
her
to
come
and
see
my
ship
then
you
have
got
a
ship
said
cartwright
if
you
are
not
on
duty
come
to
the
office
in
the
morning
and
tell
me
about
the
boat
in
the
meantime
i
put
barbara
on
the
tunnel
train
he
went
off
with
the
girl
but
barbara
turned
her
head
and
lister
saw
her
smile
chapter
ix
cartwright
sees
a
plan
in
the
morning
lister
went
to
cartwright
office
to
some
extent
he
was
embarrassed
because
he
had
begun
to
see
that
barbara
relations
might
not
approve
her
going
on
board
his
ship
and
he
imagined
cartwright
meant
to
talk
about
this
when
he
came
in
cartwright
gave
him
a
nod
and
indicated
a
chair
i
understand
you
did
not
arrange
for
barbara
to
meet
you
and
go
to
the
dock
he
said
no
sir
i
did
expect
to
meet
miss
hyslop
i
was
talking
about
the
boat
and
thought
miss
hyslop
might
like
to
see
her
cartwright
turned
and
the
electric
light
touched
his
face
he
looked
thoughtful
but
somehow
lister
imagined
he
was
not
thinking
about
his
oh
well
he
said
as
if
the
matter
were
not
important
and
went
on
i
might
have
got
you
a
post
had
you
looked
me
up
what
boat
are
you
on
board
perhaps
you
know
her
yes
belfast
model
long
bow
and
fine
lines
aft
do
know
if
i
approve
the
type
give
you
speed
at
the
cost
of
carrying
power
but
makes
a
wet
ship
in
a
head
sea
she
is
wet
lister
agreed
with
a
smile
last
run
we
could
keep
the
water
out
of
the
stokehold
had
to
cover
and
batten
gratings
and
then
a
boat
fetched
adrift
and
smashed
the
engine
skylights
what
your
rating
cartwright
asked
lister
told
him
and
he
remarked
you
have
made
some
progress
i
was
lucky
she
burst
some
boiler
tubes
in
my
watch
we
were
steaming
hard
head
to
an
ugly
sea
with
a
lot
of
cattle
on
board
and
were
forced
to
keep
her
going
two
firemen
were
scalded
but
i
was
able
to
put
the
in
the
tubes
i
used
a
trick
i
learned
on
a
canadian
lake
boat
rather
risky
but
it
worked
afterwards
the
company
moved
me
up
cartwright
was
not
surprised
he
knew
men
and
saw
the
young
fellow
was
all
he
had
thought
all
the
same
it
might
be
worth
while
to
get
some
particulars
about
the
accident
from
the
owners
you
wo
go
far
in
the
trade
why
did
you
not
try
for
a
berth
with
an
atlantic
line
there
was
some
trouble
about
your
board
of
trade
rules
and
i
might
have
been
required
to
prove
my
qualifications
for
an
english
certificate
while
i
was
inquiring
i
heard
an
engineer
was
wanted
on
board
the
regulations
do
apply
to
coasting
voyages
you
might
have
got
your
certificate
would
it
not
have
been
worth
while
lister
hesitated
his
main
object
for
joining
the
was
that
she
sailed
from
liverpool
and
he
wanted
to
see
barbara
now
and
then
as
a
rule
he
was
frank
but
he
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
enlighten
cartwright
i
do
know
he
said
you
see
i
may
go
back
to
the
railroad
soon
he
wondered
whether
cartwright
did
see
and
thought
he
had
remarked
his
hesitation
the
old
fellow
was
very
keen
cartwright
look
however
was
inscrutable
and
for
a
few
moments
he
said
nothing
then
he
picked
up
some
papers
on
his
desk
look
me
up
now
and
then
when
you
in
port
i
might
have
a
job
for
you
but
i
do
know
yet
he
said
and
added
in
a
meaning
voice
if
you
want
to
see
my
family
cartwright
will
receive
you
at
her
house
lister
colored
and
got
up
i
remember
sir
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
persuaded
miss
hyslop
i
did
stop
to
think
when
he
went
off
cartwright
smiled
but
soon
afterwards
he
put
his
in
his
pocket
and
told
gavin
he
was
going
out
he
thought
he
knew
where
to
find
the
cattle
boat
and
when
he
did
so
the
waitress
gave
them
a
table
at
which
they
would
not
be
disturbed
in
half
an
hour
cartwright
had
found
out
all
he
wanted
to
know
and
returning
to
his
office
he
smoked
and
mused
lister
had
not
exaggerated
his
pluck
and
coolness
had
kept
engines
going
when
to
stop
might
have
meant
the
loss
of
the
livestock
on
board
well
cartwright
had
known
the
fellow
was
good
stuff
and
he
might
soon
want
a
man
like
that
somebody
staunch
and
resolute
who
knew
his
job
he
had
beaten
his
antagonists
at
the
shareholders
meeting
but
doubted
if
he
could
do
so
again
in
fact
he
had
only
put
off
the
reckoning
for
six
months
in
which
he
must
make
good
and
he
knitted
his
brows
while
he
studied
picture
he
thought
about
her
sister
ship
wrecked
and
abandoned
on
the
african
coast
was
a
useful
boat
and
cheap
to
run
although
times
were
bad
cartwright
could
run
her
and
earn
some
profit
he
had
known
the
company
that
bought
her
was
getting
near
the
rocks
but
they
had
insured
her
heavily
and
there
was
something
strange
about
the
wreck
cartwright
understood
the
underwriters
had
hesitated
before
they
paid
he
himself
would
not
have
paid
he
had
a
notion
an
effort
had
been
made
to
float
but
the
salvors
did
not
know
all
cartwright
thought
he
knew
if
his
supposition
were
correct
the
wreck
might
be
worth
buying
and
one
could
no
doubt
buy
her
very
cheap
the
boat
had
for
some
time
lain
in
shifting
sands
at
the
mouth
of
an
african
river
the
underwriters
would
be
lucky
if
they
sold
her
for
old
iron
cartwright
weighed
the
cost
of
floating
if
he
employed
a
regular
salvage
company
this
would
be
high
because
they
would
bargain
for
a
large
part
of
the
value
recovered
his
plan
was
to
do
the
job
himself
with
cheaper
appliances
than
theirs
the
trouble
was
he
could
not
go
out
and
superintend
he
was
too
old
and
one
ought
to
be
an
engineer
cartwright
had
grounds
for
imagining
the
job
was
rather
an
than
a
sailor
well
he
knew
a
young
fellow
who
would
not
be
daunted
and
would
work
for
him
honestly
but
to
get
the
proper
man
was
not
all
he
pondered
about
the
money
somehow
he
might
get
the
necessary
sum
but
if
the
venture
failed
it
would
be
the
last
nobody
would
trust
him
again
he
would
be
forced
into
retirement
and
dependence
on
his
wife
it
was
a
risk
he
hesitated
to
run
and
he
resolved
to
wait
in
the
evening
after
dinner
barbara
joined
him
in
the
and
cartwright
waited
with
some
amusement
for
he
thought
he
knew
what
she
wanted
did
lister
come
to
the
office
she
asked
presently
he
did
come
did
you
think
he
would
not
oh
no
said
barbara
smiling
i
knew
he
would
come
lister
is
like
that
i
suppose
you
mean
he
honest
i
think
i
mean
he
scrupulous
when
you
crossed
the
station
platform
in
front
of
us
he
got
a
jolt
then
you
did
not
get
a
jolt
not
at
all
said
barbara
to
keep
behind
and
meet
you
after
i
sent
lister
off
would
not
have
bothered
me
however
i
was
curious
although
i
think
i
knew
the
line
he
take
you
see
for
an
unsophisticated
young
man
the
situation
was
awkward
if
he
felt
it
awkward
it
indicated
he
knew
he
ought
not
to
have
taken
you
on
board
his
boat
you
horribly
logical
barbara
rejoined
with
a
twinkle
when
we
started
he
did
know
i
ought
not
to
have
gone
lister
is
not
like
you
he
very
obvious
of
course
i
did
know
but
i
went
i
wonder
why
said
cartwright
dryly
sometimes
you
keen
but
you
did
remark
i
meant
to
give
you
a
lead
well
i
did
go
altogether
because
i
wanted
to
enjoy
lister
society
to
see
a
cattle
boat
was
something
fresh
and
i
was
dull
then
when
did
lister
see
a
light
since
he
stopped
me
it
plain
got
some
illumination
i
think
it
was
when
the
engineer
and
the
girl
robertson
is
going
to
marry
began
to
talk
about
house
furnishings
in
the
they
took
it
for
granted
lister
was
my
lover
and
he
was
horribly
embarrassed
the
thing
really
was
humorous
folks
have
hinted
i
getting
a
cartwright
remarked
to
talk
to
a
modern
girl
makes
me
feel
i
am
grace
is
not
modern
and
to
talk
to
her
makes
you
tired
barbara
rejoined
but
i
tell
you
about
the
in
the
if
you
like
then
you
got
tea
in
the
cattle
boat
of
course
said
barbara
black
tea
and
condensed
milk
and
a
ruffian
with
red
hair
whom
they
called
mike
had
made
some
doughnuts
with
lard
like
for
all
that
they
were
very
nice
people
and
if
you
do
interrupt
i
tell
you
she
told
him
about
the
party
and
cartwright
chuckled
he
pictured
her
in
the
dirty
looking
exotic
in
her
fashionable
clothes
and
expensive
furs
but
no
doubt
quite
serene
she
said
the
other
girl
was
pretty
but
cartwright
admitted
that
barbara
was
beautiful
he
rather
sympathized
with
lister
embarrassment
and
wondered
whether
barbara
meant
to
throw
some
light
on
the
young
man
character
when
she
stopped
he
asked
did
they
talk
about
some
burst
boiler
tubes
no
said
barbara
we
talked
about
and
kitchen
pans
then
she
gave
cartwright
a
keen
glance
but
what
are
boiler
tubes
do
they
sometimes
burst
they
carry
the
flame
from
the
furnace
through
the
water
if
you
much
interested
gavin
will
show
you
a
plan
of
a
ship
boiler
when
you
come
to
the
office
in
the
meantime
have
you
found
out
all
you
want
to
know
you
really
are
keen
barbara
rejoined
i
was
a
little
curious
about
what
you
said
to
mr
lister
ah
said
cartwright
i
imagined
something
like
this
i
told
him
if
he
wanted
to
see
my
family
he
must
come
to
the
house
barbara
looked
thoughtful
this
was
all
was
it
worth
while
to
tell
him
to
come
to
the
office
to
order
him
in
fact
it
was
all
that
important
i
think
it
was
important
and
expect
you
to
agree
well
you
have
carried
out
your
duty
and
ought
to
be
satisfied
said
barbara
who
got
up
and
gave
cartwright
a
smiling
glance
all
the
same
if
you
want
a
man
for
an
awkward
job
i
think
you
can
trust
mr
lister
she
went
off
and
cartwright
laughed
barbara
was
clever
the
strange
thing
was
she
had
been
cheated
by
a
theatrical
rogue
but
clever
girls
were
sometimes
like
that
he
imagined
she
liked
lister
but
this
was
perhaps
all
since
she
had
been
frank
in
one
sense
lister
was
the
man
for
barbara
he
was
honest
sober
and
resolute
and
she
needed
firm
control
the
girl
was
as
wild
as
a
hawk
and
although
she
was
marked
by
a
fine
fastidiousness
would
revolt
from
a
prig
lister
was
not
a
prig
his
blood
was
red
in
another
sense
perhaps
the
thing
was
ridiculous
barbara
was
rich
and
ought
to
make
a
good
marriage
but
good
marriages
sometimes
brought
unhappiness
human
nature
was
stubborn
one
paid
for
forcing
it
to
obey
the
rules
of
worldly
prudence
then
barbara
had
a
romantic
vein
she
would
risk
all
for
her
lover
and
not
grumble
if
she
were
forced
to
pay
for
her
staunchness
besides
she
and
lister
had
qualities
he
had
not
they
were
marked
by
something
ascetic
or
perhaps
he
meant
spartan
and
if
it
were
worth
while
could
go
without
much
that
he
required
cartwright
admitted
that
indulgence
had
cost
him
dear
he
had
paid
with
grim
philosophy
but
he
did
not
want
barbara
to
pay
although
she
was
not
his
daughter
he
loved
the
girl
and
her
recent
moodiness
bothered
him
if
she
did
not
love
lister
why
was
she
disturbed
sometimes
cartwright
thought
he
saw
a
gleam
of
light
suppose
she
did
love
the
fellow
and
was
trying
to
keep
him
off
because
of
her
canadian
adventure
lister
knew
about
that
and
barbara
was
proud
cartwright
eyes
got
bloodshot
and
he
clenched
his
fist
he
would
very
much
like
to
meet
shillito
his
muscles
were
getting
slack
but
he
had
not
lost
all
his
power
anyhow
he
could
talk
well
the
thing
was
humiliating
but
he
must
not
get
savage
when
he
let
himself
go
he
suffered
for
it
afterwards
getting
up
he
threw
away
his
cigar
and
went
off
to
talk
to
his
wife
chapter
x
a
bold
speculation
after
weighing
for
some
weeks
all
he
could
learn
about
the
wreck
on
the
african
coast
cartwright
went
to
london
and
was
carried
up
one
morning
to
the
second
floor
of
an
imposing
office
block
black
marble
columns
supported
the
molded
roof
of
the
long
passage
the
wide
stairs
were
guarded
by
polished
mahogany
and
shining
brass
and
a
screen
of
artistic
iron
work
enclosed
the
elevator
shaft
cartwright
fur
coat
and
gloves
and
varnished
boots
harmonized
with
the
surroundings
he
looked
rich
and
important
but
as
he
went
along
the
corridor
his
face
was
stern
he
was
going
to
make
a
plunge
that
would
mend
or
break
his
fortune
unless
he
got
straight
in
the
next
six
months
he
must
retire
from
the
board
and
make
the
best
bargain
possible
with
his
creditors
he
opened
a
door
and
giving
a
clerk
his
card
was
shown
into
a
handsome
private
office
morse
at
a
indicated
a
chair
and
when
cartwright
sat
down
rested
his
chin
in
his
hand
we
have
considered
your
letters
and
my
partner
bull
agrees
that
if
we
can
come
to
terms
your
suggestion
has
some
advantages
he
said
the
advantages
for
your
clients
are
obvious
cartwright
remarked
the
other
smiled
they
paid
out
a
good
sum
when
was
wrecked
and
would
frankly
like
to
get
something
back
well
we
understand
you
are
willing
to
buy
her
she
at
my
price
i
give
you
a
check
when
the
agreement
signed
then
i
expect
you
have
made
some
calculations
and
know
all
about
the
efforts
to
float
the
wreck
if
we
sell
her
to
you
the
job
is
yours
but
i
admit
some
curiosity
why
do
you
expect
to
float
her
when
the
salvage
company
failed
for
one
thing
they
started
the
job
on
extravagant
lines
cartwright
replied
they
sent
out
two
tugs
and
a
number
of
men
they
ought
to
have
hired
negro
laborers
at
the
spot
the
surf
is
often
bad
they
could
only
work
when
it
was
calm
and
while
they
were
doing
nothing
wages
mounted
up
so
did
their
bills
for
the
coal
they
must
bring
from
sierra
leone
where
coal
is
expensive
then
they
were
bothered
by
fever
and
were
forced
to
send
men
home
they
saw
the
contract
would
not
pay
and
let
it
go
the
job
was
not
impossible
it
was
costing
too
much
morse
agreed
that
cartwright
statement
was
plausible
and
probably
accurate
but
thought
he
rather
labored
his
argument
you
mean
to
use
another
plan
he
said
my
outfit
will
be
small
and
cheap
this
has
the
advantage
that
when
my
men
ca
work
i
wo
pay
much
for
wasted
time
all
the
same
my
risk
is
obvious
the
thing
a
rash
speculation
on
which
i
ca
embark
unless
you
are
satisfied
to
take
a
very
small
price
for
a
few
moments
the
ship
broker
pondered
cartwright
line
was
the
line
a
man
who
wanted
to
buy
something
cheap
would
take
all
the
same
morse
did
not
altogether
see
why
he
wanted
to
buy
the
wreck
what
about
the
cargo
he
suggested
of
course
you
understand
that
i
have
no
authority
to
sell
this
you
noticed
the
wording
of
our
original
advertisement
for
the
salving
of
the
cargo
precisely
it
is
on
that
basis
alone
that
the
cargo
underwriters
will
deal
together
with
your
offer
for
the
steamer
as
she
lies
you
must
accept
a
percentage
of
the
value
of
the
cargo
you
save
what
is
the
cargo
she
carried
in
the
forehold
i
expect
they
have
fermented
and
rotted
perhaps
the
palm
oil
aft
is
spoiled
the
barrels
will
have
gone
to
bits
oak
barrel
staves
stand
salt
water
long
the
iron
hoops
do
not
cartwright
rejoined
anyhow
i
do
reckon
on
the
cargo
i
expect
to
make
my
profit
on
buying
the
hull
yet
the
cargo
is
worth
something
i
imagine
you
know
she
carried
some
valuable
gums
ivory
and
a
quantity
of
gold
cartwright
smiled
i
do
know
the
goods
were
on
the
ship
manifest
how
much
gold
did
the
salvage
company
get
six
boxes
but
this
was
not
all
that
was
shipped
i
imagine
it
all
that
will
be
recovered
cartwright
remarked
the
other
looked
hard
at
him
but
his
face
was
inscrutable
and
he
went
on
well
i
do
want
the
cargo
and
may
be
forced
to
heave
much
of
it
overboard
in
order
to
lighten
the
hull
however
if
we
find
stuff
worth
saving
we
put
it
on
the
beach
and
i
take
a
of
the
value
and
you
can
send
out
an
agent
to
tally
the
goods
very
well
said
the
other
who
approved
the
latter
plan
although
he
imagined
cartwright
knew
something
he
did
not
let
be
frank
he
resumed
personally
i
felt
from
the
beginning
there
was
a
mystery
about
the
wreck
oh
well
said
cartwright
the
owners
of
the
boat
went
broke
and
the
merchant
who
put
the
goods
on
board
died
his
son
sold
the
business
to
a
small
company
in
which
he
took
shares
the
new
house
is
prosperous
and
respectable
it
would
be
necessary
to
know
your
ground
well
before
you
bothered
them
then
i
have
nothing
to
go
upon
but
a
vague
supposition
in
fact
the
thing
a
risky
plunge
and
if
you
refuse
my
offer
i
grumble
all
the
same
i
doubt
if
anybody
else
would
give
you
for
example
five
hundred
pounds
for
five
hundred
pounds
is
of
course
ridiculous
the
other
rejoined
and
they
began
to
bargain
when
cartwright
left
the
office
he
was
on
the
whole
satisfied
he
could
finance
the
undertaking
but
this
was
all
there
would
be
no
margin
to
cover
unforeseen
difficulties
it
was
his
last
gamble
and
besides
his
money
he
staked
his
post
and
reputation
if
he
lost
he
was
done
for
and
the
house
must
fall
soon
after
his
return
he
sent
for
lister
and
told
him
about
the
wreck
and
his
salvage
plans
i
had
some
bother
to
get
a
captain
he
said
the
job
has
not
much
attraction
for
a
sober
man
but
brown
is
not
sober
he
frankly
reckless
and
irresponsible
the
strange
thing
is
i
known
him
make
good
where
cautious
men
have
failed
then
much
depends
on
the
engineer
i
brought
you
across
to
ask
if
you
would
go
lister
eyes
sparkled
yes
sir
i
been
looking
for
a
chance
like
this
cartwright
studied
him
quietly
lister
keenness
was
obvious
the
young
fellow
liked
adventure
but
cartwright
imagined
this
did
not
account
for
all
from
one
point
of
view
i
think
the
chance
is
pretty
good
he
said
if
you
can
float
the
wreck
and
bring
her
home
i
expect
some
of
the
big
salvage
companies
will
offer
you
a
post
anyhow
you
get
your
pay
and
if
we
are
lucky
a
bonus
that
will
depend
on
the
cost
of
the
undertaking
and
the
value
of
all
we
salve
i
going
lister
declared
and
cartwright
noted
that
he
did
not
inquire
about
the
pay
then
he
hesitated
and
resumed
but
i
have
got
an
english
certificate
i
do
know
if
it
important
i
expect
you
find
the
adventure
is
marked
by
a
number
of
small
irregularities
however
to
satisfy
the
board
of
trade
is
my
business
then
you
can
reckon
on
me
but
there
another
thing
why
do
you
hope
to
lift
the
wreck
when
the
salvage
men
could
not
cartwright
smiled
i
have
been
asked
this
before
but
saw
no
grounds
for
satisfying
the
inquirer
curiosity
all
the
same
i
enlighten
you
he
did
so
and
lister
looked
up
sharply
he
had
known
cartwright
was
clever
but
the
old
fellow
was
cleverer
than
he
thought
it
was
possible
he
had
solved
a
puzzle
that
had
baffled
the
salvage
engineers
after
all
perhaps
it
was
not
strange
they
were
baffled
they
had
reckoned
on
mechanical
obstacles
cartwright
had
reckoned
on
the
intricacies
of
human
nature
i
expect
you
have
got
it
sir
lister
agreed
if
her
bilge
was
in
the
sand
and
the
divers
could
break
into
the
he
paused
and
laughed
a
powerful
centrifugal
pump
lifts
some
water
but
you
pump
out
the
atlantic
it
looks
as
if
the
salvage
company
tried
said
cartwright
dryly
however
he
talked
about
the
undertaking
giving
lister
particulars
he
thought
he
ought
to
know
and
when
the
young
man
went
off
all
important
plans
had
been
agreed
upon
soon
afterwards
cartwright
went
home
and
found
cartwright
had
gone
to
bed
he
was
getting
disturbed
about
her
but
since
the
doctor
had
said
she
must
rest
he
talked
to
barbara
in
the
evening
he
told
her
about
the
wreck
and
smiled
when
he
stated
that
lister
would
have
control
i
think
you
declared
he
was
the
man
for
an
awkward
job
he
said
barbara
looked
at
him
rather
hard
perhaps
i
did
say
so
you
imply
you
are
sending
lister
because
you
thought
i
like
it
not
at
all
said
cartwright
the
thing
a
business
venture
still
your
statement
carried
weight
i
admit
your
judgment
sometimes
is
sound
she
turned
her
head
and
when
she
looked
up
and
replied
her
voice
was
rather
hard
you
must
not
trust
my
judgment
i
have
been
cheated
my
dear
said
cartwright
perhaps
my
remark
was
unlucky
but
the
cleverest
of
us
is
sometimes
cheated
and
you
were
not
cheated
long
we
let
it
go
i
bothered
about
your
mother
she
feels
the
damp
and
cold
and
is
not
picking
up
perhaps
we
ought
to
send
her
south
i
must
talk
to
the
doctor
in
the
morning
he
saw
the
doctor
who
said
they
had
better
wait
for
a
time
and
cartwright
occupied
himself
by
outfitting
the
salvage
expedition
finding
it
necessary
to
go
to
london
he
called
on
the
gentleman
from
whom
he
had
bought
the
wreck
a
short
time
ago
when
we
made
the
agreement
you
asked
if
i
knew
anybody
who
would
give
me
five
hundred
pounds
for
the
boat
remarked
morse
just
then
i
did
not
know
but
not
long
since
i
was
offered
a
better
price
than
yours
ah
said
cartwright
thoughtfully
she
lay
in
the
sand
for
some
time
and
nobody
bothered
about
her
who
was
willing
to
buy
the
other
smiled
a
shipbroker
stated
a
sum
at
which
he
would
take
her
off
our
hands
it
was
plain
he
was
an
agent
but
he
would
give
his
customer
name
i
do
imagine
you
will
find
out
from
him
i
tried
cartwright
said
it
was
strange
and
went
off
soon
afterwards
when
he
went
down
in
the
lift
he
smiled
for
he
thought
he
saw
a
light
after
all
his
speculation
was
not
as
rash
as
it
looked
when
he
got
home
cartwright
had
come
downstairs
and
she
joined
the
others
at
dinner
the
doctor
said
she
was
stronger
and
might
soon
undertake
a
journey
south
he
suggested
the
canaries
and
cartwright
approved
if
you
sail
by
a
cape
liner
it
a
short
run
and
after
you
leave
the
spanish
coast
the
sea
is
generally
smooth
he
said
since
i
must
stay
at
the
office
we
must
decide
who
is
going
with
you
hyslop
said
he
would
like
to
go
and
would
do
so
if
it
were
necessary
but
to
get
away
just
then
was
awkward
grace
declared
somebody
must
stop
to
look
after
cartwright
and
the
house
and
she
imagined
this
was
her
post
for
all
that
since
she
was
older
than
barbara
it
was
hard
to
see
her
duty
cartwright
did
not
indicate
whom
she
wanted
although
she
glanced
at
barbara
since
she
was
ill
she
had
got
very
languid
and
cartwright
did
not
meddle
he
knew
his
stepchildren
and
it
was
characteristic
that
grace
talked
about
her
duty
taking
care
of
an
invalid
at
a
foreign
hotel
had
not
much
charm
for
grace
very
well
said
barbara
i
gave
you
and
mortimer
first
chance
because
i
not
important
but
since
you
have
good
grounds
for
staying
we
wo
argue
she
turned
to
cartwright
i
going
because
i
want
to
go
cartwright
gave
her
a
gentle
smile
and
it
was
plain
that
she
was
satisfied
but
when
she
had
gone
to
bed
and
cartwright
was
alone
he
pondered
barbara
loved
her
mother
and
would
have
gone
had
she
not
wanted
to
go
but
he
thought
she
did
want
and
had
an
object
he
had
told
her
something
about
his
plans
and
had
stated
that
he
would
use
grand
canary
as
a
supply
depot
for
the
expedition
then
he
had
found
the
girl
studying
an
atlantic
chart
in
the
library
barbara
had
no
doubt
noted
the
island
lay
conveniently
near
the
african
coast
and
knew
it
was
an
important
coaling
station
at
which
steamers
bound
south
from
liverpool
called
cartwright
wondered
whether
she
had
argued
she
might
see
lister
at
grand
canary
chapter
xi
the
start
rain
was
falling
and
the
light
had
hardly
reached
the
opening
between
the
tall
warehouses
in
the
dock
the
water
was
smooth
and
shone
with
dull
reflections
but
the
gates
were
open
and
the
muddy
swell
the
flood
tide
brought
up
the
river
splashed
about
the
entrance
ponderous
lorries
rumbled
across
a
bridge
indistinct
figures
moved
and
shouted
on
the
pierhead
and
men
in
wet
oilskins
splashed
about
deck
she
was
a
battered
propeller
tug
and
lay
against
the
wall
with
large
cases
of
machinery
lashed
to
her
bulwarks
and
a
stack
of
coal
built
up
beside
the
her
bunkers
were
full
but
the
fuel
she
carried
would
not
last
very
long
and
coal
is
dear
at
foreign
ports
coils
of
thick
wire
rope
and
diving
gear
occupied
her
shallow
hold
and
cartwright
was
annoyed
because
she
could
not
take
the
massive
centrifugal
pump
which
he
had
sent
by
an
african
liner
some
extra
coal
and
supplies
were
loaded
on
a
clumsy
wooden
hulk
but
he
durst
not
risk
her
carrying
expensive
machinery
when
he
talked
to
the
captain
in
the
he
was
on
the
whole
satisfied
brown
face
was
flushed
and
his
voice
was
hoarse
but
he
would
pull
himself
together
after
he
got
to
sea
cartwright
knew
habits
when
he
gave
him
the
job
although
in
an
important
sense
the
job
was
lister
to
trust
the
young
fellow
was
a
bold
experiment
but
cartwright
did
so
if
lister
were
not
the
man
he
thought
cartwright
imagined
his
control
of
the
line
would
presently
come
to
an
inglorious
end
to
some
extent
this
accounted
for
his
bringing
barbara
to
see
the
salvage
expedition
start
he
knew
the
power
of
love
barbara
had
not
gone
up
the
greasy
ladder
to
the
bridge
and
waited
on
deck
she
had
left
home
without
much
breakfast
in
the
dark
and
was
cold
and
rather
depressed
all
was
gloomy
and
strangely
flat
the
tug
looked
small
and
was
horribly
dirty
covered
rails
and
ropes
grimy
drops
from
the
rigging
splashed
on
the
trampled
black
mud
on
deck
the
crew
were
not
sober
and
their
faces
were
black
two
or
three
draggled
women
called
to
them
from
the
pierhead
their
voices
sounding
melancholy
and
harsh
barbara
had
not
seen
lister
and
wondered
where
he
was
until
a
man
plunged
out
from
the
neighboring
door
of
the
the
abruptness
of
his
exit
indicated
that
he
had
been
rudely
propelled
by
somebody
behind
and
as
he
lurched
across
the
deck
lister
appeared
at
the
door
his
cap
was
dark
with
grease
his
overalls
were
stained
and
a
black
smear
ran
from
his
eye
to
chin
hustle
and
get
that
oil
drum
on
the
wharf
you
drunken
hog
he
shouted
if
i
had
watched
out
you
have
left
half
the
truck
he
stopped
when
he
saw
barbara
this
is
very
kind
he
said
to
her
i
knew
cartwright
was
on
board
but
had
hoped
you
would
come
to
give
us
a
good
barbara
noted
his
satisfaction
and
was
moved
by
something
in
his
voice
he
looked
thin
and
in
his
stained
engineer
clothes
and
his
hands
were
greasy
the
surroundings
were
not
romantic
but
somehow
they
got
brighter
and
her
gloom
vanished
lister
eyes
sparkled
he
wore
the
stamp
of
strength
and
confidence
i
doubted
if
my
would
bring
me
but
i
really
meant
to
come
she
said
for
one
thing
i
wanted
to
ask
you
she
hesitated
for
it
was
hard
to
strike
the
right
note
she
had
begun
to
see
there
was
something
exciting
and
perhaps
heroic
about
the
adventure
the
handful
of
men
had
undertaken
a
big
thing
there
was
much
against
them
and
daunting
risks
must
be
run
moreover
she
had
studied
cartwright
and
remarked
the
anxiety
he
thought
he
had
hid
cartwright
was
rather
inscrutable
but
sympathy
had
given
her
power
to
understand
she
thought
he
was
engaged
in
a
reckless
gamble
and
could
not
afford
to
lose
whatever
you
want
lister
declared
but
she
stopped
him
i
want
you
to
do
your
best
you
can
reckon
on
that
anyhow
cartwright
has
hired
me
i
his
man
barbara
smiled
yes
i
know
you
honest
and
will
do
all
you
engaged
but
in
a
sense
this
is
not
enough
i
want
you
to
make
an
extra
effort
because
she
paused
and
the
blood
came
to
her
skin
when
she
went
on
you
see
it
important
you
should
float
the
wreck
and
bring
her
home
it
means
much
to
my
very
much
i
think
he
kind
and
i
love
him
i
feel
i
ought
to
help
lister
saw
her
statement
was
significant
and
her
embarrassment
indicated
that
she
knew
it
was
so
in
fact
she
had
admitted
that
she
knew
he
would
for
her
sake
use
all
his
powers
he
was
moved
but
he
was
not
a
fool
the
girl
wearing
her
costly
furs
looked
rich
and
dignified
he
was
a
working
engineer
and
conscious
of
his
greasy
clothes
he
loved
her
but
for
a
time
he
must
be
cautious
to
begin
with
he
would
not
have
her
think
he
made
a
claim
you
not
very
logical
he
replied
carelessly
when
i
took
the
job
i
undertook
to
earn
my
pay
cartwright
sends
me
off
to
float
the
wreck
and
if
it
possible
i
must
make
good
i
am
logical
barbara
declared
while
her
color
came
and
went
one
thinks
one
does
one
best
but
sometimes
when
the
strain
comes
one
can
do
better
it
really
is
ridiculous
emotion
sentiment
give
one
extra
force
she
stopped
and
resumed
in
a
strangely
gentle
voice
you
are
young
and
if
you
do
make
good
it
wo
hurt
very
much
cartwright
old
he
ca
try
again
then
he
not
my
only
he
my
friend
and
i
know
he
trusts
you
for
his
sake
i
must
be
frank
i
trust
you
lister
smiled
but
his
voice
betrayed
him
although
he
thought
he
used
control
very
well
if
it
possible
for
flesh
and
blood
we
bring
home
that
all
the
thing
done
with
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
kept
the
glove
with
the
dark
grease
stain
then
seeing
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
she
looked
about
ragged
clouds
rolled
up
from
the
southwest
and
the
disturbed
swell
that
splashed
about
the
dock
gates
indicated
wind
down
channel
a
shower
beat
upon
the
engine
skylights
and
barbara
moved
beneath
the
bridge
a
great
rope
rose
out
of
the
water
as
the
men
at
the
winch
hauled
up
the
clumsy
hulk
two
or
three
others
dragging
a
thin
stiff
wire
rope
floundered
unsteadily
across
the
deck
they
look
rough
and
they
not
very
sober
barbara
remarked
lister
laughed
they
frankly
drunk
a
pretty
hard
crowd
but
brown
and
i
have
handled
a
hard
crowd
before
in
fact
i
reckon
cartwright
has
got
the
proper
men
for
the
job
captain
brown
is
like
them
said
barbara
thoughtfully
you
are
not
you
have
seen
me
hustling
round
when
things
go
wrong
i
saw
you
throw
a
man
out
of
the
not
long
since
with
a
gang
like
ours
one
must
prove
one
claim
to
be
boss
at
the
start
anyhow
there
are
different
kinds
of
wastrels
and
the
fellow
who
gets
on
a
jag
at
intervals
is
often
a
pretty
good
sort
the
wastrel
one
has
no
use
for
is
the
fellow
who
keeps
it
up
but
i
see
cartwright
coming
and
must
philosophize
a
gateman
on
the
pierhead
began
to
shout
to
the
captain
and
cartwright
gave
lister
his
hand
they
are
waiting
for
you
and
we
must
get
ashore
he
said
well
given
you
and
brown
a
big
job
but
i
expect
you
see
me
out
we
put
in
all
we
got
sir
said
lister
quietly
cartwright
nodded
as
if
he
were
satisfied
and
touched
barbara
who
turned
and
gave
lister
a
smile
good
luck
she
said
and
following
cartwright
went
up
the
steps
in
the
wall
she
thought
it
significant
cartwright
had
left
her
for
some
time
and
had
given
lister
a
quick
searching
glance
lister
had
said
nothing
about
their
talk
and
his
promise
she
had
known
he
would
not
do
so
yet
this
was
not
because
he
was
clever
he
had
a
sort
of
instinctive
fastidiousness
she
liked
his
reply
to
cartwright
he
put
in
all
he
had
got
and
a
man
like
that
had
much
fine
courage
resolution
and
staunch
loyalty
when
barbara
reached
the
pierhead
engines
began
to
throb
the
propeller
churned
the
green
water
and
the
tug
bumped
against
the
wall
gatemen
shouted
the
big
splashed
and
tightened
with
a
jerk
and
the
hulk
began
to
move
then
the
tug
bow
crept
round
the
corner
and
swung
off
from
the
gates
the
engine
throbbed
faster
and
a
blast
of
the
whistle
echoed
about
the
warehouses
brown
waved
his
cap
and
signed
to
a
man
in
the
the
hulk
swung
round
in
a
wide
sweep
and
the
adventurous
voyage
had
begun
steaming
across
the
strong
current
looked
small
and
dingy
when
she
rolled
as
the
helm
went
over
the
swell
washed
her
low
bulwarks
she
got
smaller
until
a
rain
squall
blew
across
from
the
cheshire
side
and
she
melted
into
the
background
of
dark
water
and
smoke
barbara
felt
strangely
forlorn
and
it
was
some
relief
when
cartwright
touched
her
arm
and
they
set
off
along
the
wall
after
the
rain
the
wind
freshened
and
when
brown
steamed
out
from
the
river
a
confused
sea
rolled
across
the
shoals
the
light
was
not
good
but
a
double
row
of
buoys
led
out
to
sea
the
was
running
and
made
good
progress
she
shipped
no
water
yet
and
the
hulk
lurched
along
without
much
strain
on
the
rope
the
rope
was
fastened
to
a
massive
iron
hook
and
ran
across
a
curved
wooden
horse
at
the
stern
sometimes
it
slipped
along
the
horse
and
tightened
with
a
bang
for
the
clumsy
hulk
sheered
about
when
her
stern
went
up
one
saw
an
indistinct
figure
holding
the
wheel
when
they
passed
the
bar
lightship
lister
climbed
to
the
bridge
and
for
a
few
minutes
looked
about
the
plunging
red
hull
to
starboard
was
the
last
of
the
mersey
marks
for
the
ship
was
hidden
by
low
clouds
ahead
the
angry
gray
water
was
broken
by
streaks
of
foam
rolled
and
quivered
when
her
bows
smashed
a
sea
and
showers
of
spray
beat
like
hail
against
the
screens
on
the
bridge
she
loggish
brown
remarked
if
you
do
burn
up
that
coal
soon
she
wash
it
off
looks
like
a
dirty
night
and
i
pushing
across
for
lynas
point
with
the
wind
at
i
want
to
get
under
the
anglesey
coast
there
be
some
sea
in
the
channel
when
we
open
up
holyhead
the
boat
good
said
lister
engines
a
bit
neglected
but
running
smooth
and
cool
and
she
has
power
to
shove
her
along
cartwright
has
an
eye
for
a
useful
craft
brown
nodded
the
old
fellow
has
an
eye
for
all
that
useful
i
reckon
he
sees
farther
than
any
man
i
know
there
something
encouraging
about
this
because
the
job
he
given
us
looks
tough
he
stopped
for
the
slipped
noisily
across
the
horse
there
was
a
clang
of
iron
as
the
hook
took
the
strain
and
the
captain
frowned
that
hulk
is
going
to
bother
us
before
very
long
lister
seized
the
slanted
rails
the
lightship
had
vanished
but
a
bright
beam
pierced
the
haze
astern
ahead
the
sea
was
empty
gray
water
rolled
beneath
low
and
ragged
clouds
spray
flew
about
the
plunging
bows
and
the
tug
rolled
uneasily
lister
turned
and
left
the
bridge
but
stopped
for
a
few
moments
at
the
door
barbara
had
stood
just
opposite
where
the
iron
ran
down
her
rich
furs
gave
her
girlish
figure
a
touch
of
dignity
the
color
was
in
her
face
and
her
eyes
shone
lister
knew
the
picture
would
haunt
him
and
he
would
come
to
the
engine
door
to
recapture
it
when
he
needed
bracing
he
would
need
bracing
for
there
were
obstacles
ahead
but
he
had
promised
barbara
to
help
cartwright
out
stepping
across
the
ledge
to
a
slippery
platform
he
went
below
part
iii
the
breaking
strain
chapter
i
the
first
struggle
the
slanted
and
light
and
shadow
played
about
the
throbbing
machinery
it
looked
as
if
the
lamps
swung
in
a
semicircle
but
they
did
not
all
else
slanted
at
an
angle
the
swiveled
lamps
were
still
overhead
the
dark
and
bulky
cylinders
cut
against
the
reflected
glimmer
on
the
skylights
below
and
flashed
across
the
gloom
and
the
twinkling
cranks
spun
in
their
shallow
pit
one
saw
the
big
columns
shake
and
strain
as
the
crosshead
shot
up
and
down
the
groaned
with
the
back
push
of
the
propeller
a
door
in
the
bulkhead
was
open
and
now
and
then
a
blaze
from
the
stokehold
lighted
the
shovels
clanged
and
the
thud
of
a
hammer
jarred
upon
the
throb
of
machinery
men
moved
about
like
ghosts
their
feet
made
no
noise
for
a
moment
one
saw
their
faces
and
then
they
vanished
lister
sat
on
a
an
old
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
was
happier
than
he
had
been
for
long
for
one
thing
his
men
were
getting
sober
and
he
saw
they
knew
their
job
then
he
was
satisfied
with
his
engines
and
relished
the
sense
of
control
he
was
and
until
the
tug
came
back
from
africa
the
engines
were
his
in
the
meantime
he
need
not
move
about
it
was
like
listening
to
an
orchestra
of
which
he
knew
all
the
instruments
and
he
heard
no
jarring
notes
the
harmony
was
good
and
the
rhythm
well
marked
the
clash
and
clang
rose
and
fell
with
a
measured
beat
but
the
smooth
running
of
his
engines
did
not
account
for
all
lister
satisfaction
in
a
sense
barbara
had
given
him
his
job
he
was
her
servant
doing
her
work
and
this
was
much
although
he
scarcely
durst
hope
for
another
reward
cartwright
had
not
without
careful
thought
sent
lister
on
board
he
knew
the
young
fellow
staunchness
as
he
knew
barbara
and
because
his
need
was
great
had
not
hesitated
to
use
him
and
the
girl
he
was
old
and
must
be
resigned
to
sit
at
his
desk
and
plan
but
as
a
rule
his
plans
worked
and
he
had
a
talent
for
choosing
his
tools
when
it
was
possible
he
used
his
tools
carefully
he
hated
to
overstrain
fine
material
regular
lurch
and
roll
indicated
that
she
was
steaming
along
the
coast
in
some
shelter
from
the
wind
that
blew
obliquely
off
the
land
by
and
by
however
the
lurches
got
violent
and
when
lister
heard
the
thud
of
water
on
deck
he
went
up
and
opening
the
door
on
the
lee
side
looked
out
water
splashed
against
the
ledge
that
protected
the
the
stack
of
coal
worked
and
he
heard
big
lumps
fall
spray
blew
across
the
bulwarks
and
fell
in
heavy
showers
from
a
boat
on
the
skids
for
a
few
moments
this
was
all
he
could
distinguish
and
then
he
saw
slopes
of
water
slanting
away
from
the
tug
low
side
a
shone
for
a
few
moments
between
ragged
clouds
and
was
hidden
lister
stepped
across
the
ledge
and
went
aft
felt
the
drag
of
the
hulk
astern
and
he
wanted
to
see
how
she
was
towing
he
heard
the
iron
ring
clang
on
the
hook
and
when
he
stopped
by
the
horse
the
big
surged
to
and
fro
across
the
arch
the
hulk
steered
wildly
and
if
the
sea
got
worse
he
doubted
if
they
could
hold
her
he
knew
where
he
was
because
he
had
steamed
along
the
coast
on
board
the
cattle
boat
the
anglesey
shore
was
fringed
by
reefs
the
ran
in
white
turmoil
across
the
ledges
the
tide
had
now
nearly
run
out
but
when
they
turned
the
corner
at
carmel
point
they
would
meet
the
flood
stream
and
the
big
combers
the
gale
drove
up
channel
going
to
the
lister
lighted
his
pipe
a
fierce
night
he
remarked
to
brown
who
peered
through
the
glass
i
reckon
you
want
to
slow
down
when
we
make
carmel
the
house
was
dark
but
lister
saw
the
captain
turn
i
bothered
brown
admitted
we
ought
to
push
on
but
while
we
might
tow
the
hulk
under
we
ca
tow
her
down
channel
we
ca
turn
and
run
blowing
down
the
menai
strait
like
a
bellows
spout
and
there
all
the
mersey
sands
to
leeward
we
have
got
to
face
the
sea
and
try
to
make
holyhead
will
your
engines
shove
her
through
they
give
you
six
or
seven
knots
head
to
wind
will
your
tow
rope
hold
i
doubt
we
have
a
steel
hawser
ready
but
if
she
breaks
the
hemp
rope
she
probably
break
the
wire
lister
agreed
the
thick
hemp
rope
stretched
and
absorbed
the
strain
the
wire
was
less
elastic
they
were
approaching
carmel
point
and
holyhead
was
not
far
but
they
must
front
the
gale
when
they
got
round
the
corner
in
the
meantime
the
engines
were
running
smoothly
and
lister
smoked
and
waited
while
the
sea
got
worse
flashing
lights
ahead
and
the
violent
lurching
indicated
that
they
crept
round
the
point
then
plunged
into
a
white
sea
and
deck
and
bulwarks
vanished
her
bows
swung
out
of
the
foam
and
lister
ran
to
the
door
he
felt
the
tug
leap
forward
and
knew
the
rope
had
gone
he
got
out
in
front
of
brown
and
plunged
down
the
ladder
since
must
be
stopped
and
turned
he
was
needed
water
ran
from
his
clothes
when
he
reached
a
slanted
platform
and
seized
a
greasy
wheel
the
telegraph
gong
was
clanging
and
the
beat
of
engines
slackened
as
he
followed
the
orders
then
the
spinning
cranks
stopped
altogether
and
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
a
strange
quietness
one
heard
the
wind
and
water
splashed
in
the
bilges
lister
got
the
signal
and
when
he
restarted
his
engines
ran
up
the
ladder
he
could
trust
the
man
he
left
and
wanted
to
see
what
was
happening
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
he
could
satisfy
his
curiosity
and
then
a
bright
beam
illuminated
the
tug
and
angry
water
brown
was
burning
a
while
crept
up
to
the
hulk
he
meant
to
pass
the
fresh
hawser
but
could
not
launch
a
boat
and
lister
doubted
if
the
men
on
the
hulk
could
heave
the
heavy
wire
rope
on
board
although
one
must
get
near
to
throw
a
line
it
looked
as
if
brown
were
going
alongside
two
dark
figures
crouched
on
rail
like
animals
ready
to
spring
cut
against
the
blaze
brown
was
going
alongside
anyhow
he
was
going
near
enough
for
the
men
to
jump
but
the
thing
was
horribly
risky
if
the
rolling
hulk
struck
the
tug
planks
and
iron
plates
would
be
beaten
in
moreover
the
men
must
jump
from
the
slanted
rail
and
if
they
jumped
short
their
long
boots
and
oilskins
would
drag
them
down
it
looked
as
if
cartwright
knew
how
to
choose
men
for
an
awkward
job
for
as
the
tug
got
nearer
lister
saw
the
men
meant
to
go
she
swung
up
on
the
top
of
a
white
sea
the
hulk
swept
by
spray
rolled
down
with
her
deck
close
below
the
steamer
rail
one
felt
they
must
shock
but
they
did
not
the
dark
figures
leaped
there
was
a
faint
shout
a
line
whirled
out
from
bridge
and
the
hulk
drove
astern
then
the
blue
light
vanished
and
lister
plunged
into
the
somehow
the
thing
was
done
the
gong
signaled
the
rhythmic
clash
of
engines
began
and
lister
felt
tremble
as
she
tightened
the
rope
brown
had
played
his
part
and
lister
had
begun
he
wondered
whether
they
could
keep
the
water
out
of
the
they
had
drifted
and
now
they
had
opened
up
the
channel
the
combers
leaped
on
board
the
seas
were
not
regular
they
ran
in
short
steep
ridges
and
gave
the
tug
no
time
to
lift
while
she
swung
her
bows
from
the
foaming
turmoil
the
next
swept
her
deck
but
to
watch
the
seas
and
keep
the
hulk
in
line
was
the
captain
business
and
lister
was
occupied
by
his
standing
on
a
slanted
platform
with
his
hand
on
the
throttle
he
waited
for
the
lurch
that
lifted
the
spinning
screw
when
the
blades
left
the
water
the
engines
raced
with
a
horrible
din
and
he
must
cut
off
steam
if
he
let
the
engines
go
something
might
break
when
the
propeller
got
hold
again
the
work
demanded
a
firm
but
delicate
touch
since
the
pressure
must
change
with
the
load
one
could
not
argue
when
the
bows
would
plunge
and
the
stern
swing
clear
one
must
know
instinctively
the
muscular
effort
was
not
hard
but
lister
face
was
wet
with
sweat
and
when
he
was
slow
and
the
rang
with
the
clash
of
machinery
his
heart
beat
the
big
columns
that
held
the
cylinders
rocked
crank
and
spun
too
fast
for
him
to
see
there
was
a
confusing
flash
of
steel
and
a
daunting
uproar
for
the
most
part
he
was
able
to
get
control
before
the
stern
came
down
moreover
he
was
not
using
full
steam
to
let
her
go
would
swamp
the
boat
and
wash
the
men
off
the
laboring
hulk
lister
knew
the
rope
held
because
he
felt
the
heavy
drag
although
she
rolled
and
plunged
there
was
no
life
in
movements
she
was
sluggish
embarrassed
by
the
load
she
hauled
lister
thought
about
the
men
on
board
the
hulk
two
buffeted
by
wind
and
spray
must
hold
the
wheel
on
the
short
that
lifted
them
above
the
shelter
of
the
bulwarks
forward
of
this
the
water
rolled
about
washing
on
board
and
pouring
out
the
men
could
not
for
a
moment
slack
their
watchfulness
sweating
and
straining
at
the
spokes
they
must
hold
her
straight
to
let
her
sheer
when
she
crossed
a
comber
top
would
break
the
rope
the
strain
on
the
laboring
engines
indicated
that
the
men
held
out
and
lister
fixed
his
thoughts
on
his
machinery
one
could
not
see
much
but
while
he
turned
the
he
listened
if
a
bearing
got
hot
or
a
brass
shook
loose
he
would
hear
the
jar
an
engine
running
as
it
ought
to
run
was
like
a
instrument
he
heard
no
discord
the
heavy
thud
of
the
flashing
between
their
guides
beat
time
to
the
clang
of
the
a
pump
throbbed
like
a
kettledrum
and
something
tinkled
like
a
triangle
all
went
well
the
engines
were
good
and
stubbornly
forged
ahead
by
and
by
the
strain
was
less
marked
the
load
was
getting
lighter
and
after
a
time
lister
let
go
the
wheel
and
wiped
his
wet
face
he
could
stand
on
the
platform
without
support
the
plunges
were
easy
and
regular
calling
a
man
to
relieve
him
he
went
to
the
door
the
sea
was
white
but
it
no
longer
ran
in
crested
ridges
and
a
vague
dark
line
crossed
the
foam
ahead
sometimes
part
of
the
line
vanished
and
reappeared
like
a
row
of
dots
with
broad
gaps
between
lister
knew
it
was
breakwater
on
the
other
side
tossed
and
in
the
background
a
dull
reflected
illumination
indicated
a
town
then
the
gong
rang
and
lister
went
back
to
the
platform
in
a
few
minutes
he
would
get
the
signal
to
stop
his
engines
the
first
struggle
was
over
brown
had
made
holyhead
chapter
ii
the
wreck
the
night
was
calm
but
now
and
then
a
faint
hot
wind
blew
from
the
shadowy
coast
and
rippling
the
water
brought
a
strange
sour
smell
lister
did
not
know
the
smell
brown
knew
and
frowned
for
he
had
been
broken
by
the
malaria
that
haunts
west
african
river
mouths
heavy
dew
dripped
from
the
awnings
on
bridge
and
in
places
trickled
through
the
material
since
canvas
burns
in
the
african
sun
brown
searched
the
dark
coast
with
his
glasses
trying
to
find
the
marks
he
had
noted
on
the
chart
lister
leaned
against
the
rails
and
mused
about
the
voyage
they
had
ridden
out
a
winter
gale
in
the
bay
of
biscay
and
for
a
night
had
lost
the
hulk
and
the
men
on
board
then
they
went
into
vigo
where
lister
firemen
wrecked
a
wine
shop
and
it
cost
him
much
in
bribes
to
save
them
from
jail
he
had
another
taste
of
their
quality
at
las
palmas
where
they
made
trouble
with
the
port
guards
and
brown
brawled
in
the
cheap
wine
shops
behind
the
cathedral
in
fact
it
was
some
relief
when
the
captain
fell
off
the
steam
tram
that
runs
between
town
and
port
and
a
cut
on
his
head
stopped
his
adventures
then
they
steamed
for
miles
before
the
northeast
trades
with
a
misty
blue
sky
overhead
and
long
seas
rolling
up
astern
the
trade
breeze
was
cool
and
bracing
but
they
lost
it
near
the
coast
and
now
the
air
was
hot
and
strangely
heavy
one
felt
languid
and
cheerfulness
cost
an
effort
the
men
had
begun
to
grumble
and
lister
was
glad
the
voyage
was
nearly
over
and
it
was
time
to
get
to
work
lightning
flickered
on
the
sea
touching
the
back
of
the
smooth
swell
and
then
for
a
few
moments
left
all
very
dark
the
moon
was
new
the
sky
was
cloudy
and
the
swell
ran
high
for
it
rolled
unbroken
and
gathering
momentum
from
the
antarctic
ice
when
the
lightning
was
bright
one
saw
a
low
cloud
that
looked
like
steam
with
a
white
streak
beneath
that
marked
the
impact
of
the
big
rollers
on
the
sandy
coast
the
crash
of
breakers
came
out
of
the
dark
like
the
rattle
of
a
goods
train
crossing
an
iron
bridge
four
fathoms
at
spring
tides
and
a
shifting
channel
brown
remarked
quoting
from
a
the
depth
however
varies
with
the
wind
and
a
stranger
must
use
caution
when
entering
the
lagoon
he
stopped
and
laughed
as
he
resumed
if
this
was
a
sober
undertaking
i
steam
off
and
wait
for
daylight
i
reckon
it
would
be
prudent
said
lister
dryly
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
prudence
brown
rejoined
our
job
to
work
in
a
sun
that
knocks
a
white
man
down
and
stew
in
the
hot
malaria
damp
the
land
breeze
brings
off
at
night
cartwright
orders
are
to
lose
no
time
and
i
want
to
finish
before
the
fever
finishes
me
very
well
when
the
moon
is
new
at
twelve
and
along
this
coast
sunset
about
six
hours
later
if
we
wait
for
it
will
be
four
or
five
before
we
get
on
board
the
wreck
i
understand
the
tide
does
leave
her
until
about
four
hours
ebb
if
we
push
across
the
bar
we
see
her
at
daybreak
and
can
make
our
plans
for
getting
to
work
lister
agreed
expenses
were
heavy
and
it
was
important
they
should
not
lose
a
day
moreover
cartwright
had
hinted
that
he
expected
them
to
run
risks
and
lister
had
promised
barbara
to
help
him
out
if
brown
touched
bottom
steaming
in
tug
and
barge
would
soon
break
up
but
lister
was
not
going
to
be
daunted
i
go
down
and
raise
some
extra
steam
he
said
you
need
full
pressure
to
shove
her
through
the
surf
he
was
occupied
for
some
time
but
when
a
plume
of
steam
blew
from
the
he
came
up
to
the
door
and
looked
about
languid
roll
was
getting
sharper
mast
and
funnel
swung
into
a
wide
sweep
sometimes
the
dark
hull
lurched
up
high
above
the
tug
stern
and
sometimes
sank
in
a
hollow
the
rollers
had
angry
white
tops
and
a
belt
of
filmy
vapor
that
looked
luminous
closed
the
view
ahead
lister
knew
the
vapor
was
phosphorescent
spray
flung
up
by
the
turmoil
on
the
bar
through
which
they
must
go
if
the
tug
struck
and
stopped
the
white
seas
would
beat
her
down
into
the
sand
in
the
meantime
she
was
using
full
steam
because
since
tide
and
surf
carried
her
on
one
must
have
speed
to
steer
the
spray
cloud
got
thick
and
wavered
with
luminous
tremblings
when
the
long
rollers
broke
they
came
up
spangled
with
green
and
gold
flashes
from
astern
shook
their
fiery
crests
about
the
tug
and
vanished
ahead
but
one
heard
them
crash
lister
thought
the
tug
throbbed
to
the
savage
concussion
he
could
not
hear
his
engines
one
heard
nothing
but
the
daunting
uproar
by
and
by
he
felt
a
shock
not
a
violent
shock
but
as
if
the
boat
had
touched
and
was
pushing
through
something
soft
she
slowed
and
lister
saw
the
black
hulk
swing
up
and
ride
forward
on
a
giant
roller
top
it
looked
as
if
she
were
coming
on
board
the
tug
and
lister
jumped
through
and
slammed
the
iron
door
brown
would
need
him
now
he
heard
the
roar
of
water
on
deck
there
was
a
crash
of
broken
glass
and
a
shower
fell
on
his
head
a
cloud
of
steam
and
a
loud
hissing
came
from
the
stokehold
and
he
knew
the
sea
that
swept
the
tug
had
covered
the
gratings
if
she
stuck
the
next
sea
would
swamp
her
and
drown
the
fires
but
she
had
not
altogether
stopped
the
propeller
was
beating
hard
and
he
opened
the
throttle
wide
he
felt
her
move
and
tremble
as
if
she
struggled
in
the
grip
of
the
sand
and
then
lift
buoyantly
the
water
that
pressed
her
down
had
rolled
off
the
deck
and
the
oncoming
comber
had
picked
her
up
and
was
carrying
her
along
her
progress
was
obvious
one
felt
the
headlong
rush
and
lister
thought
about
a
toboggan
speeding
down
an
icy
slope
the
roller
would
bear
her
on
until
it
broke
but
if
she
struck
the
sand
she
might
not
lift
again
she
did
not
strike
there
was
another
wild
leap
forward
a
savage
plunge
and
a
comber
crashed
astern
it
looked
as
if
she
had
crossed
the
shoal
and
lister
let
go
the
wheel
and
got
his
breath
he
had
used
no
effort
but
he
gasped
and
his
hand
shook
the
gong
signaled
and
when
he
slowed
his
engines
the
roar
of
escaping
steam
pierced
the
turmoil
of
the
surf
this
was
significant
because
he
could
not
have
heard
the
steam
a
few
minutes
earlier
rolled
but
the
rolling
was
not
violent
and
began
to
get
easy
the
gong
signaled
by
he
shut
the
valve
and
presently
heard
the
anchor
plunge
and
the
rattle
of
running
chain
then
swung
languidly
and
all
was
quiet
but
for
the
monotonous
rumble
in
the
background
lister
gave
some
orders
and
went
to
his
room
in
the
morning
he
put
a
greasy
jacket
over
his
pajamas
and
went
on
deck
the
land
breeze
had
dropped
and
it
was
very
calm
vague
trees
loomed
in
the
fog
that
hid
the
beach
there
was
a
belt
of
dull
heaving
water
and
then
the
spray
cloud
closed
the
view
the
air
was
heavy
the
men
on
deck
moved
slackly
and
lister
skin
was
wet
by
sweat
he
felt
dull
and
shrank
from
effort
but
when
he
saw
brown
in
a
boat
alongside
he
jumped
on
board
the
light
was
getting
brighter
and
the
wreck
lay
about
a
hundred
yards
off
the
stump
of
her
broken
funnel
a
bare
iron
mast
a
smashed
deckhouse
and
a
strip
of
slanted
side
rose
from
the
languid
swell
the
rows
of
plates
were
red
with
rust
and
encrusted
by
shells
when
the
smooth
undulations
sank
long
weed
swung
about
in
the
sandy
water
lister
thought
the
story
of
the
wreck
was
on
the
surface
plain
steaming
out
with
a
heavy
load
had
struck
the
bar
the
surf
had
beaten
in
her
hatches
broken
some
plates
and
afterwards
washed
her
back
across
the
sand
then
while
the
captain
tried
to
reach
the
beach
she
had
sunk
in
deeper
water
the
story
was
plausible
but
if
cartwright
had
found
the
proper
clew
it
did
not
account
for
all
they
rowed
round
she
lay
with
a
sharp
list
and
her
other
side
was
under
water
the
tide
was
beginning
to
rise
and
when
it
crept
up
her
slanted
deck
they
pulled
back
to
the
tug
we
moor
the
hulk
alongside
and
rig
the
diving
pumps
i
think
all
brown
remarked
when
the
sun
is
low
i
go
to
the
factory
up
the
creek
and
try
to
hire
some
native
boys
on
this
coast
a
white
man
who
does
heavy
work
soon
gets
fever
in
the
afternoon
they
took
two
men
and
rowed
up
a
muddy
creek
that
flowed
into
the
lagoon
but
the
factory
was
farther
than
they
thought
and
when
they
landed
dusk
was
falling
the
wooden
house
stood
near
the
bank
with
a
stockaded
compound
between
it
and
the
water
it
was
built
on
piles
and
at
the
top
of
the
outside
stairs
a
veranda
ran
along
the
front
the
compound
was
tunneled
by
holes
and
light
mist
crept
about
the
giant
cotton
woods
behind
there
was
no
movement
of
air
a
sickly
smell
rose
from
the
creek
and
all
was
very
damp
lister
and
brown
went
up
the
stairs
and
were
received
by
a
white
man
in
a
big
damp
room
a
lamp
hung
from
a
beam
and
the
light
touched
the
patches
of
mildew
on
the
discolored
walls
there
was
not
much
furniture
a
few
canvas
chairs
a
desk
and
a
table
flies
crawled
about
the
table
and
hovered
in
a
black
swarm
round
the
lamp
the
room
smelt
of
palm
oil
and
river
mud
the
white
man
was
young
but
his
face
was
haggard
and
he
looked
worn
his
rather
long
hair
was
wet
and
his
duck
jacket
was
dirty
it
was
obvious
that
he
did
not
bother
about
his
clothes
good
of
you
to
look
me
up
i
expect
you
know
i
montgomery
the
house
is
montgomery
and
raeburn
he
said
however
to
begin
with
you
had
better
have
a
drink
i
call
my
boy
a
negro
came
in
and
got
a
bottle
and
some
glasses
he
was
a
fellow
with
a
blue
stripe
on
his
forehead
and
muscular
arms
and
chest
but
his
legs
which
stuck
out
from
short
cotton
trousers
were
ridiculously
thin
he
beat
up
some
frothy
liquor
in
a
jug
and
when
he
filled
the
big
glasses
lister
felt
disturbed
for
he
knew
brown
and
had
noted
the
quantity
of
gin
the
negro
used
the
captain
however
was
cautious
and
they
began
to
talk
lister
asked
montgomery
if
he
carried
on
the
factory
alone
i
doing
so
for
a
time
my
clerk
died
two
or
three
weeks
since
and
i
have
got
another
yet
fever
said
brown
common
malaria
perhaps
this
spot
is
worse
than
others
because
although
we
beginning
to
kill
mosquitos
and
poison
the
drains
we
ca
keep
english
boys
the
last
two
did
hold
out
six
months
lister
got
thoughtful
he
knew
the
african
coast
was
unhealthy
but
had
not
imagined
it
was
as
bad
as
this
he
said
nothing
and
montgomery
resumed
i
have
been
forced
to
lie
up
and
am
shaky
yet
malaria
gets
us
all
but
as
a
rule
it
gets
strangers
particularly
the
young
soonest
looks
as
if
the
microbe
liked
fresh
blood
if
i
was
an
african
merchant
i
let
an
agent
run
my
factories
brown
remarked
montgomery
smiled
sometimes
it
necessary
for
me
to
come
out
this
factory
is
perhaps
our
best
and
when
nevis
our
agent
died
i
started
by
the
first
boat
montgomery
is
an
old
house
but
since
the
big
men
combined
and
the
amalgamation
built
a
factory
on
the
next
creek
we
have
had
some
trouble
to
pull
along
our
capital
is
small
and
we
ca
use
methods
in
fact
i
imagine
our
situation
is
much
like
cartwright
when
he
bought
the
wreck
he
no
doubt
felt
some
strain
but
wo
you
take
another
drink
brown
indicated
his
glass
which
still
held
some
liquor
and
lister
refused
politely
he
noted
that
montgomery
knew
their
object
and
was
surprised
since
he
thought
cartwright
had
not
talked
much
about
the
undertaking
then
although
montgomery
was
obviously
ill
one
felt
he
tried
to
paint
the
coast
in
the
darkest
colors
what
do
you
think
about
our
job
brown
asked
i
think
it
a
rash
experiment
and
imagine
cartwright
agrees
all
the
same
the
old
fellow
a
bold
gambler
and
is
perhaps
willing
to
speculate
on
the
chance
of
getting
out
of
his
embarrassments
however
this
is
his
business
and
you
no
doubt
get
your
wages
although
you
wo
float
the
wreck
what
do
you
reckon
the
obstacles
fever
said
montgomery
dryly
the
salvage
people
lost
some
men
surf
will
wash
the
sand
about
her
if
the
wind
comes
fresh
from
the
then
the
sharks
may
give
you
some
trouble
they
nearly
as
numerous
as
they
are
at
lagos
roads
he
paused
and
added
carelessly
i
expect
you
know
my
father
loaded
i
heard
something
about
it
brown
replied
all
the
same
cartwright
sent
us
to
lift
her
and
we
have
got
to
try
will
you
let
me
hire
some
of
your
factory
boys
sorry
but
they
liberian
kroos
engaged
on
a
contract
to
work
in
my
compound
and
i
accountable
for
them
to
the
liberian
government
then
what
about
boys
from
the
bush
montgomery
smiled
i
ca
recommend
the
bushmen
they
a
turbulent
lot
but
you
might
send
a
present
to
the
headman
at
the
native
town
up
river
and
it
possible
he
let
you
go
to
see
him
for
all
that
some
caution
indicated
the
fellow
a
cunning
old
rascal
brown
looked
thoughtful
but
began
to
talk
about
something
else
and
by
and
by
got
up
montgomery
went
with
him
and
lister
to
the
steps
and
when
they
reached
the
compound
they
found
the
sailors
bemused
with
gin
under
the
veranda
brown
had
some
trouble
to
get
the
men
on
board
and
when
they
awkwardly
pulled
away
lister
was
conscious
of
relief
i
agree
with
the
fellow
caution
indicated
brown
observed
chapter
iii
a
fuel
problem
a
few
days
after
his
visit
to
the
factory
lister
sat
one
morning
under
a
tarpaulin
they
had
stretched
across
the
hulk
the
paint
on
the
canvas
smelt
as
if
it
burned
but
the
awning
gave
some
shade
and
one
could
not
front
the
sun
on
the
open
deck
the
sea
breeze
had
not
sprung
up
and
dazzling
reflections
played
about
the
oily
surface
of
the
swell
in
one
place
where
the
shadow
of
the
wreck
fell
the
water
was
a
cool
dull
green
a
row
of
bubbles
slowly
crossed
the
belt
of
shade
stopped
and
made
a
frothy
patch
and
then
lengthened
out
a
flexible
pipe
slipped
across
the
edge
of
the
open
gangway
and
lister
felt
the
line
he
held
the
line
was
slack
and
he
knew
the
diver
needed
nothing
two
men
their
skins
shining
with
sweat
turned
the
handles
and
the
rattle
of
the
cranks
cut
the
dull
rumble
of
the
surf
brown
sitting
on
a
studied
a
plan
of
the
wreck
cartwright
had
given
him
and
lister
thought
it
typical
cartwright
had
got
the
plan
the
old
fellow
was
very
keen
by
and
by
brown
looked
up
and
indicated
the
panting
men
we
want
colored
boys
for
this
job
and
must
get
a
gang
i
expect
you
noted
montgomery
declared
his
lot
were
kroos
the
kroos
are
hefty
boys
and
pretty
good
sailors
but
they
come
from
liberia
and
there
are
regulations
about
their
employment
you
must
engage
them
on
a
contract
hold
yourself
accountable
for
their
return
and
so
forth
all
the
same
my
notion
is
montgomery
did
mean
to
help
then
we
had
better
try
the
native
headman
he
talked
about
brown
smiled
i
no
use
for
bushmen
but
did
see
much
use
in
telling
montgomery
i
been
on
the
coast
before
for
one
thing
his
boys
were
not
all
kroos
you
know
the
kroo
by
his
blue
but
i
saw
two
or
three
with
another
mark
thought
them
gold
coast
fantis
and
a
fanti
fisherman
is
useful
on
board
ship
in
a
day
or
two
i
going
back
to
see
lister
lighted
his
pipe
and
weighed
the
captain
remarks
on
the
whole
he
agreed
that
it
did
not
look
as
if
montgomery
meant
to
help
the
fellow
was
hospitable
but
hospitality
that
implied
his
pressing
liquor
on
the
captain
and
making
the
sailors
drunk
had
drawbacks
brown
had
used
control
but
lister
doubted
if
his
resolution
would
stand
much
strain
then
although
montgomery
story
about
the
need
for
his
being
on
the
spot
was
plausible
it
was
perhaps
strange
the
head
of
a
merchant
house
would
stop
for
some
time
at
a
factory
where
his
clerks
died
however
now
lister
thought
about
it
montgomery
did
not
state
if
he
had
been
there
long
the
fellow
was
generous
with
his
liquor
and
his
boy
can
mix
a
cocktail
he
remarked
brown
grinned
on
the
coast
they
all
generous
with
liquor
montgomery
knows
this
but
i
a
notion
you
are
wondering
whether
he
knows
me
i
reckon
not
but
he
knows
the
kind
of
skipper
you
generally
meet
in
the
palm
oil
trade
still
the
type
going
out
now
pay
higher
they
get
better
men
in
fact
i
something
of
a
survival
from
the
old
school
he
picked
up
the
plan
and
lister
thought
about
montgomery
the
man
was
ill
and
but
this
was
not
strange
the
factory
was
rather
a
daunting
spot
reeking
with
foul
smells
and
haunted
by
a
sense
of
gloom
lister
thought
one
might
get
morbid
and
imaginative
if
one
stopped
there
long
yet
he
rather
liked
montgomery
there
was
something
attractive
about
him
perhaps
if
they
had
met
in
brighter
surroundings
when
the
other
health
and
mood
were
normal
they
might
have
been
friends
now
however
he
doubted
and
saw
brown
was
not
satisfied
the
line
he
held
jerked
and
he
signed
to
the
men
at
the
pump
one
kept
the
cranks
turning
the
other
went
to
the
top
of
a
ladder
lashed
to
the
hulk
side
the
bubbles
moved
away
from
the
wreck
and
broke
the
surface
in
a
fixed
sparkling
patch
the
diver
was
coming
up
and
lister
presently
helped
him
on
board
when
they
had
taken
off
his
copper
helmet
and
unfastened
his
canvas
he
leaned
against
the
pump
and
breathed
hard
well
said
brown
after
waiting
a
minute
or
two
for
the
man
to
get
back
his
normal
breathing
she
lies
with
a
sharp
list
sand
high
up
her
starboard
bilge
doors
jambed
but
i
found
the
stokehold
grating
and
got
some
way
down
the
ladder
sand
washed
down
and
buried
the
starboard
bunkers
to
clear
out
the
stuff
will
be
a
long
job
packed
hard
the
diver
nodded
like
cement
i
reckon
the
pump
wo
move
it
lister
understood
the
captain
frown
sometimes
the
sand
that
enters
a
sunken
vessel
solidifies
with
the
pressure
of
surf
or
tide
into
a
mass
that
one
can
hardly
dig
out
this
however
was
not
all
starboard
bunkers
buried
brown
resumed
they
were
pretty
full
when
she
left
forcados
she
had
a
list
to
port
and
they
trimmed
her
by
using
the
coal
on
that
side
first
well
it
awkward
i
reckoned
on
getting
the
fuel
there
is
some
coal
on
the
port
side
said
lister
if
cartwright
plan
and
notes
are
accurate
there
not
enough
to
see
us
out
the
wrecking
pump
will
burn
a
lot
brown
rejoined
and
turned
to
the
diver
did
you
see
any
sharks
one
big
fellow
he
hung
about
as
if
he
was
curious
and
i
did
like
him
near
my
but
he
left
me
alone
the
pulps
you
meet
in
warm
seas
are
worse
than
sharks
when
i
was
down
at
the
spanish
boat
crawling
through
the
holes
in
her
broken
hull
was
nervous
work
once
i
saw
an
arm
as
thick
as
mine
waving
in
the
dark
and
started
for
the
ladder
we
blew
in
that
piece
of
her
bilge
with
dynamite
before
i
went
on
board
again
however
when
i
cleared
up
a
bit
i
take
lister
down
the
diver
got
into
the
boat
and
rowed
to
the
tug
but
the
others
stopped
in
the
shade
of
the
awning
they
had
brought
a
spare
diving
dress
and
before
they
tried
to
lift
the
wreck
lister
must
find
out
if
supposition
was
correct
because
if
cartwright
had
found
the
proper
clew
the
job
would
be
easier
for
all
that
lister
frankly
shrank
from
the
preparatory
exercise
diving
in
water
had
not
much
charm
in
the
morning
they
hauled
the
tug
alongside
the
wreck
and
at
rigged
a
derrick
and
opened
the
fore
hatch
the
palm
kernels
had
rotted
and
a
horrible
pulpy
mass
swollen
by
fermentation
rose
nearly
to
the
ledge
it
was
glutinous
and
too
thick
for
the
pump
to
lift
since
the
water
that
filled
the
vessel
drained
away
through
the
broken
plates
as
the
tide
sank
brown
kneeling
on
the
knitted
his
brows
the
stuff
forced
up
by
its
buoyancy
he
said
we
may
find
it
looser
as
we
get
down
in
the
meantime
suction
no
use
we
have
got
to
break
it
out
by
hand
start
your
winch
and
we
fill
the
skip
lister
signaled
a
man
on
board
the
tug
the
winch
rattled
and
a
big
iron
bucket
hanging
by
a
wire
rope
dropped
into
the
hold
a
gang
of
men
climbed
across
the
ledge
and
began
to
cut
the
slimy
mass
with
spades
the
surface
heaved
beneath
them
like
a
treacherous
bog
and
the
smell
was
horrible
now
and
then
a
spade
made
an
opening
for
the
gases
to
escape
and
the
nauseated
men
were
driven
back
for
all
that
they
filled
the
skip
and
the
swinging
derrick
carried
the
load
across
the
deck
and
tilted
it
overboard
the
heat
was
almost
unbearable
the
reflections
from
the
oily
swell
and
wet
deck
hurt
one
eyes
and
lister
noted
that
the
deck
did
not
dry
until
the
sea
breeze
began
to
blow
the
wind
brought
a
faint
coolness
and
drove
back
the
smell
but
the
men
efforts
presently
got
slack
the
labor
was
exhausting
and
one
must
wear
some
clothes
because
the
sun
burned
one
skin
they
held
out
until
the
rising
water
drove
them
from
the
hatch
and
when
they
went
back
to
the
tug
brown
looked
thoughtful
the
men
ca
keep
it
up
the
thing
impossible
a
week
like
this
would
knock
out
the
lot
he
said
we
must
use
native
boys
and
going
to
get
some
in
the
morning
lister
took
his
first
diving
lesson
and
when
the
big
copper
helmet
was
screwed
on
and
the
air
began
to
swell
his
canvas
clothes
he
shrank
from
the
experiment
the
load
of
metal
he
carried
was
crushing
he
could
hardly
drag
his
weighted
boots
across
the
deck
and
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
he
hesitated
watching
the
bubbles
that
marked
the
spot
where
the
diver
had
vanished
then
he
remembered
his
promise
to
barbara
and
cautiously
went
down
the
dazzling
sunshine
vanished
a
wave
of
misty
green
closed
above
the
helmet
glass
hot
compressed
air
blew
about
his
head
and
his
began
to
throb
then
lead
and
copper
lost
their
weight
he
felt
buoyant
and
clung
to
the
steps
at
the
bottom
he
was
for
a
few
moments
afraid
to
let
go
but
an
indistinct
monstrous
object
came
out
of
the
strange
green
gloom
and
beckoned
him
on
lister
went
making
an
effort
for
balance
because
he
now
felt
ridiculously
light
then
the
reflections
were
puzzling
for
the
light
came
and
went
with
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
swell
yet
he
could
see
and
he
followed
the
diver
until
they
stopped
opposite
the
wreck
port
bilge
her
side
went
up
like
a
dark
wall
covered
by
waving
weed
lister
head
ached
and
his
breathing
was
labored
but
not
much
pressure
was
needed
to
keep
out
the
shallow
water
and
the
diver
had
promised
to
warn
him
when
they
had
stayed
long
enough
he
forced
himself
to
examine
the
plate
the
other
indicated
was
a
vessel
and
a
number
of
the
straps
had
burst
plates
were
smashed
and
some
of
the
holes
were
large
but
in
places
the
iron
was
drilled
and
in
others
patches
had
been
bolted
on
the
salvage
company
had
done
part
of
this
work
and
he
thought
it
possible
to
make
the
damage
good
if
they
could
stop
the
remaining
holes
the
big
pump
ought
to
throw
out
the
water
but
cartwright
had
talked
about
another
opening
and
this
would
be
awkward
to
reach
signing
the
diver
to
go
on
he
followed
him
round
the
vessel
stern
the
sand
on
the
other
side
was
high
and
one
could
climb
on
board
but
lister
shrank
from
the
dark
alleyway
that
led
to
the
for
all
that
he
went
in
and
saw
the
diver
had
opened
the
jambed
door
when
he
reached
the
ledge
a
flash
from
the
other
electric
lamp
pierced
the
gloom
and
he
tried
to
forget
his
throbbing
head
and
looked
about
sparkling
bubbles
from
his
and
the
diver
helmets
floated
straight
up
to
the
skylights
along
which
they
glided
and
vanished
through
a
hole
in
the
glass
the
water
moving
gently
with
the
pulse
of
the
swell
broke
the
beam
of
light
and
objects
it
touched
were
distorted
and
magnified
the
top
of
the
big
cylinder
looked
gigantic
and
the
thick
columns
appeared
to
bend
long
weed
clung
to
the
platforms
from
which
iron
ladders
went
down
but
so
far
as
lister
could
distinguish
all
below
was
buried
in
sand
he
had
seen
enough
to
clear
the
engines
would
be
a
heavy
task
and
one
must
work
in
amidst
a
maze
of
ladders
gratings
and
machinery
to
keep
and
free
from
entanglement
looked
impossible
but
perhaps
when
they
had
broken
the
surface
the
pump
would
lift
the
sand
anyhow
he
was
getting
dizzy
and
his
breath
was
labored
he
touched
the
diver
and
they
went
back
along
the
alleyway
and
round
the
vessel
stern
lister
was
desperately
anxious
to
reach
the
ladder
and
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
use
control
as
he
went
up
his
dress
got
heavy
and
he
was
conscious
of
his
weighted
boots
the
pressure
on
his
lungs
lessened
he
was
dazzled
by
a
strong
light
and
feeling
the
edge
of
the
hulk
deck
he
got
his
knee
on
her
and
lurched
forward
somebody
took
off
his
helmet
and
lifted
the
weight
from
his
chest
he
shut
his
eyes
and
for
a
few
moments
lay
on
the
deck
well
said
brown
presently
you
reached
the
lister
nodded
she
badly
sanded
up
it
plain
we
sha
get
much
coal
from
the
starboard
bunkers
until
we
can
lift
her
to
an
even
keel
that
will
be
long
brown
rejoined
and
pondered
we
must
have
coal
he
resumed
if
i
ca
find
another
plan
you
must
take
the
tug
to
sierra
leone
and
bring
a
load
but
we
let
it
go
just
now
the
first
thing
is
to
hire
some
negro
laborers
and
as
soon
as
i
can
leave
the
wreck
i
try
again
chapter
iv
montgomery
offer
was
near
and
a
trail
of
smoke
creeping
up
along
the
coast
streaked
the
shining
sea
brown
watched
the
smoke
until
two
masts
and
a
funnel
rose
out
of
the
vapor
and
began
to
get
distinct
then
he
put
down
his
glasses
and
lighted
his
pipe
the
steamer
was
making
for
the
lagoon
he
had
not
long
since
gone
to
the
native
town
up
the
creek
and
returned
with
a
gang
of
laborers
so
far
the
negroes
had
worked
well
but
just
now
he
did
not
need
them
and
they
lay
about
in
the
shade
some
wearing
a
short
and
some
a
sheet
of
cotton
that
hung
from
their
shoulders
the
tide
had
covered
the
wreck
but
the
big
rotary
pump
was
running
and
since
the
men
had
loosened
the
top
of
the
cargo
it
lifted
the
slimy
stuff
a
plume
of
steam
that
looked
faint
and
diaphanous
in
the
strong
light
blew
away
from
the
noisy
machine
a
large
flexible
pipe
rose
from
the
submerged
hold
and
another
ran
from
the
pump
across
the
hulk
deck
from
the
end
of
the
pipe
a
thick
brown
flood
poured
into
the
water
and
stained
the
green
lagoon
as
the
flood
tide
carried
it
along
the
clash
and
rattle
of
the
engine
carried
far
for
the
load
was
heavy
and
lister
was
using
full
steam
the
boiler
was
large
and
the
furnace
burned
more
coal
than
he
had
thought
sometimes
palm
kernels
that
had
not
altogether
rotted
jambed
the
fans
and
he
held
the
trying
to
ease
the
shocks
while
the
perspiration
dripped
from
his
blistered
skin
when
brown
indicated
the
steamer
he
looked
up
she
coming
in
i
think
i
know
the
hooker
the
captain
remarked
coasting
tank
goes
anywhere
she
float
for
twenty
tons
of
freight
the
skipper
no
doubt
expects
montgomery
got
a
few
hogsheads
of
oil
and
it
possible
he
sell
us
some
coal
the
are
pretty
keen
to
trade
we
want
coal
said
lister
and
turned
abruptly
the
pump
jarred
and
stopped
the
swollen
suction
pipe
shrank
and
the
splash
of
the
discharge
died
away
for
some
time
lister
was
occupied
and
when
he
restarted
the
engine
and
looked
about
again
the
steamer
was
steering
for
the
hulk
she
was
a
small
vessel
going
light
with
much
of
her
rusty
side
above
water
a
big
hung
ready
for
lowering
at
her
rail
and
a
wooden
awning
covered
her
when
the
throb
of
her
engines
slackened
two
or
three
white
men
leaned
over
her
bulwarks
and
looked
down
at
the
hulk
with
languid
curiosity
their
faces
were
haggard
and
their
poses
slack
the
stamp
of
the
was
plain
the
telegraph
rang
the
engines
stopped
and
a
man
on
the
bridge
shouted
good
morning
you
have
taken
on
an
awkward
job
his
voice
was
hollow
and
strained
and
by
contrast
brown
sounded
full
and
hearty
we
getting
ahead
all
the
same
where
are
you
for
leone
after
we
call
at
montgomery
then
you
can
fill
your
bunkers
and
our
coal
getting
short
can
you
sell
us
some
the
other
asked
how
much
brown
wanted
and
how
much
he
would
pay
then
he
beckoned
a
man
on
the
deck
to
come
up
and
turned
to
brown
again
we
might
give
you
two
or
three
loads
but
i
see
you
when
we
come
back
we
must
get
up
the
creek
and
moor
her
before
the
tide
ebbs
he
seized
the
telegraph
handle
the
propeller
began
to
turn
and
when
the
steamer
forged
ahead
brown
looked
thoughtful
perhaps
i
better
take
a
trip
up
the
creek
in
the
evening
we
want
the
coal
and
i
do
altogether
trust
montgomery
he
said
lister
agreed
that
it
might
be
prudent
for
brown
to
go
but
he
was
occupied
by
the
pump
and
they
said
no
more
to
lift
the
cargo
when
the
water
covered
the
wreck
hatches
and
loosened
the
pulpy
mass
was
easier
and
he
must
keep
his
engine
running
full
speed
when
they
stopped
he
was
exhausted
by
the
heat
and
the
strain
of
watching
and
did
not
go
with
brown
the
captain
did
not
as
he
had
promised
come
back
in
the
morning
but
after
a
time
a
streaked
the
forest
and
the
steamer
moved
out
on
the
lagoon
lister
sent
a
boy
for
the
glasses
since
he
expected
brown
was
on
board
but
so
far
as
he
could
see
the
captain
was
not
the
white
wave
at
the
bows
indicated
that
the
vessel
was
steaming
fast
and
it
did
not
look
as
if
she
was
going
to
stop
in
order
to
reach
the
channel
across
the
bar
she
must
pass
near
the
hulk
and
lister
waved
to
the
captain
what
about
the
coal
he
shouted
the
other
leaned
out
from
the
rails
and
lister
studying
him
with
the
glasses
saw
a
small
patch
like
sticking
plaster
on
his
forehead
the
side
of
his
face
was
discolored
as
if
it
were
bruised
and
frowning
savagely
he
shook
his
fist
you
can
go
to
leone
or
the
next
hottest
spot
for
your
coal
he
roared
and
began
to
storm
lister
had
sometimes
disputed
with
western
railroad
hands
and
marine
firemen
but
he
thought
the
captain
remarks
equaled
the
others
best
efforts
in
fact
it
was
some
relief
when
a
lump
of
coal
thrown
by
a
sailor
on
the
hulk
crashed
upon
the
wooden
awning
and
for
a
moment
the
savage
skipper
paused
for
all
that
lister
stopped
the
sailor
who
was
going
to
throw
another
block
hold
on
the
stuff
is
valuable
he
said
the
captain
began
again
but
the
steamer
had
forged
ahead
and
his
voice
got
fainter
and
was
presently
drowned
by
the
beat
of
the
screw
lister
went
back
to
the
pump
the
machine
was
running
unevenly
and
sometimes
the
powerful
engine
jarred
he
meant
to
take
it
down
but
so
long
as
the
pump
sucked
up
the
kernels
he
durst
not
stop
speed
was
important
they
must
finish
the
job
and
get
away
before
the
heat
and
malaria
wore
them
out
in
the
meantime
he
was
disturbed
about
brown
who
ought
to
have
returned
and
at
sunset
he
started
for
the
factory
in
the
tug
second
boat
dark
came
suddenly
and
when
he
landed
a
hot
clammy
fog
thickened
the
gloom
little
fires
the
factory
boys
had
lighted
by
ancient
custom
twinkled
in
the
haze
and
a
yellow
beam
from
the
veranda
windows
touched
the
towering
cottonwoods
but
all
else
was
dark
and
the
spot
was
somehow
forbidding
one
felt
the
gloom
was
sinister
a
few
miles
up
the
creek
the
naked
bushmen
served
their
savage
gods
with
fantastic
rites
and
the
men
and
ghost
leopards
ruled
the
shadowy
land
at
the
factory
white
men
got
sick
and
died
lister
went
up
the
steps
and
entering
the
big
room
saw
montgomery
in
a
madeira
chair
his
face
was
wet
by
sweat
but
although
his
thin
form
was
covered
by
a
blanket
he
shook
with
ague
brown
occupied
a
rude
couch
made
from
two
long
boxes
in
which
flintlock
guns
are
shipped
he
lay
in
an
ungainly
pose
his
head
had
fallen
from
a
cushion
and
his
face
was
dark
with
blood
his
eyes
were
shut
and
he
breathed
with
a
snoring
noise
what
the
matter
with
the
captain
lister
asked
although
he
thought
he
knew
he
exhausted
by
his
efforts
and
the
worse
for
liquor
montgomery
answered
with
a
laugh
on
the
whole
i
think
you
had
better
let
him
sleep
perhaps
you
remarked
that
some
of
the
glass
is
broken
and
two
of
my
chairs
are
smashed
lister
had
not
remarked
this
but
he
looked
about
and
began
to
understand
he
had
seen
brown
throw
a
spanish
landlord
out
of
a
grand
canary
wine
shop
your
captain
arrived
when
the
steamboat
men
were
dining
with
me
montgomery
resumed
in
this
country
we
a
hospitable
lot
and
it
the
custom
to
send
west
african
factories
a
supply
of
liquor
every
three
months
mine
arrived
not
long
since
and
if
you
open
the
cupboard
see
how
much
is
left
but
there
are
cigarettes
in
the
tin
box
they
mildew
unless
they
canned
make
yourself
a
cocktail
i
do
want
to
get
up
and
my
boy
in
the
compound
playing
a
drum
to
keep
off
the
ghosts
lister
lighted
a
cigarette
and
listened
a
monotonous
rhythmic
throb
stole
into
the
room
and
he
felt
there
was
something
about
the
noise
that
jarred
i
cut
out
the
cocktail
you
rather
generous
with
your
liquor
he
remarked
dryly
but
how
did
the
trouble
brown
made
begin
by
a
dispute
about
some
coal
ah
said
lister
who
looked
at
montgomery
hard
he
imagined
the
steamboat
captain
had
meant
to
give
them
coal
since
the
man
had
agreed
with
brown
about
the
price
in
fact
it
looked
as
if
he
had
been
willing
to
do
so
until
he
arrived
at
the
factory
then
he
refused
and
brown
no
doubt
got
savage
montgomery
was
not
embarrassed
and
indicated
the
unconscious
skipper
if
cartwright
not
losing
his
keenness
it
strange
he
sent
out
a
man
like
this
but
perhaps
he
could
get
a
sober
captain
to
go
brown
has
some
talents
for
example
he
got
the
boys
we
wanted
although
you
refused
to
help
we
must
see
if
he
can
keep
them
montgomery
rejoined
with
a
meaning
smile
in
the
meantime
it
not
important
are
you
making
much
progress
at
the
wreck
lister
admitted
that
they
were
not
getting
on
as
fast
as
he
had
hoped
and
when
montgomery
gave
him
a
keen
glance
tried
to
brace
himself
he
felt
slack
and
his
head
ached
he
had
been
getting
slack
recently
and
now
when
he
imagined
he
must
be
alert
to
think
was
a
bother
you
have
not
been
long
at
the
lagoon
but
you
beginning
to
feel
the
climate
the
other
remarked
it
perhaps
the
unhealthiest
spot
on
an
unhealthy
coast
and
a
white
man
can
not
work
in
the
african
sun
however
you
know
why
the
salvage
company
threw
up
their
contract
they
lost
a
number
of
their
men
and
if
you
stay
until
the
morning
you
can
see
their
graves
the
rest
of
the
gang
had
had
enough
and
were
too
sick
to
keep
the
pump
running
you
are
not
encouraging
lister
observed
i
do
exaggerate
i
know
the
country
and
the
caution
one
must
use
but
you
see
i
the
thing
was
obvious
montgomery
hollow
face
was
wet
by
sweat
his
eyes
were
dull
and
his
hands
shook
lister
saw
he
tried
to
be
cool
but
thought
him
highly
strung
if
you
wise
you
give
up
your
post
and
get
away
before
fever
knocks
you
out
montgomery
resumed
in
fact
i
think
i
can
promise
you
another
berth
the
house
owns
two
or
three
factories
and
at
one
we
are
going
to
start
a
big
running
to
a
native
market
up
river
then
we
have
bought
new
machinery
for
breaking
palm
nuts
and
extracting
the
kernels
and
have
fixed
a
site
for
the
building
at
a
dry
sandy
spot
i
do
claim
the
neighborhood
healthy
but
it
healthier
than
this
and
we
have
inquired
about
an
engineer
would
you
like
the
post
i
think
not
i
cartwright
man
i
taken
his
pay
montgomery
smiled
ironically
let
be
frank
i
expect
you
want
to
force
me
to
make
a
high
bid
you
do
know
the
african
coast
yet
but
you
not
a
fool
and
are
beginning
to
understand
the
job
you
have
undertaken
you
ca
float
the
wreck
the
fellow
cartwright
sent
to
help
you
is
a
drunken
brute
and
i
have
grounds
for
thinking
cartwright
himself
will
soon
go
broke
well
we
need
an
engineer
and
i
admit
we
have
not
found
good
men
keen
about
applying
if
you
can
run
the
launch
and
plant
we
give
you
two
hundred
pounds
bonus
for
breaking
your
engagement
besides
better
wages
than
cartwright
pays
lister
knitted
his
brows
and
lighted
a
fresh
cigarette
he
was
not
tempted
but
he
wanted
to
think
and
his
brain
was
dull
to
begin
with
he
wondered
whether
montgomery
did
not
think
him
something
of
a
fool
because
it
was
plain
the
fellow
had
grounds
for
offering
a
bribe
his
doing
so
indicated
that
he
did
not
want
the
wreck
floated
anyhow
montgomery
had
imagined
he
would
not
hesitate
to
break
his
engagement
for
two
hundred
pounds
he
must
be
cautious
and
control
his
anger
on
the
whole
it
would
pay
me
to
turn
down
cartwright
job
he
said
two
hundred
pounds
is
not
a
very
big
wad
and
if
we
can
take
the
boat
home
i
reckon
the
salvage
people
would
give
me
a
good
post
i
must
wait
until
i
satisfied
the
thing
impossible
when
you
are
satisfied
i
have
no
object
for
engaging
you
we
want
an
engineer
now
montgomery
replied
well
said
lister
i
reckon
that
is
so
he
paused
and
thinking
he
saw
where
the
other
led
resolved
to
make
an
experiment
all
the
same
since
you
are
willing
to
buy
me
off
it
looks
as
if
we
had
a
fighting
chance
to
make
good
then
if
i
am
forced
to
quit
i
rather
think
pay
me
something
not
to
talk
for
example
if
i
put
cartwright
wise
montgomery
gave
him
a
scornful
smile
you
keener
than
i
thought
but
you
ca
tell
cartwright
much
he
does
believe
he
knows
i
risk
your
talking
to
somebody
else
oh
well
said
lister
i
guess
we
let
it
go
in
the
meantime
get
off
and
take
the
captain
along
i
allow
you
have
fixed
him
pretty
good
but
he
put
his
mark
on
the
steamboat
man
and
your
furniture
he
called
the
sailors
and
finding
the
two
who
had
brought
brown
to
the
factory
carried
him
downstairs
and
put
him
on
board
the
boat
the
captain
snored
heavily
and
did
not
awake
when
they
pushed
off
and
with
the
other
boat
in
tow
drifted
down
the
creek
lister
pondered
he
did
not
know
if
he
had
well
played
his
part
but
he
had
not
wanted
montgomery
to
think
his
staunchness
to
his
employer
must
be
reckoned
on
he
would
sooner
the
fellow
thought
him
something
of
a
fool
when
montgomery
offered
the
bribe
he
probably
knew
he
was
rash
his
doing
so
indicated
that
he
was
willing
to
run
some
risk
and
this
implied
that
cartwright
supposition
about
the
wreck
was
justified
montgomery
was
obviously
resolved
she
should
not
be
floated
and
might
be
a
troublesome
antagonist
for
example
he
had
stopped
their
getting
coal
and
lister
was
persuaded
he
had
made
brown
drunk
if
the
control
the
captain
had
so
far
used
broke
down
it
would
be
awkward
since
montgomery
would
no
doubt
supply
him
with
liquor
it
was
plain
the
fellow
meant
to
bother
them
as
much
as
possible
but
since
he
had
not
owned
the
wrecked
steamer
his
object
was
hard
to
see
in
the
meantime
lister
let
it
go
and
concentrated
on
steering
the
boat
past
the
mud
banks
in
the
creek
chapter
v
montgomery
uses
his
power
some
time
after
lister
went
to
the
factory
he
woke
one
night
from
disturbed
sleep
his
small
room
under
bridge
was
very
hot
and
the
door
and
port
were
open
a
faint
draught
blew
in
and
the
mosquito
curtain
moved
about
his
bed
the
tug
rolled
languidly
and
the
water
splashed
against
her
side
farther
off
the
gentle
swell
broke
with
a
dull
murmur
across
the
wreck
this
was
all
but
lister
was
persuaded
he
had
when
half
awake
heard
something
else
at
dusk
a
drum
had
begun
to
beat
across
the
lagoon
and
the
faint
monotonous
noise
had
jarred
it
was
typically
african
the
negroes
used
drums
for
signaling
although
white
men
had
not
found
out
their
code
lister
had
come
to
hate
all
that
belonged
to
the
fever
coast
the
drum
however
was
not
beating
now
and
he
rather
thought
he
had
heard
the
splash
of
a
canoe
paddle
there
was
no
obvious
reason
this
should
bother
him
but
he
was
bothered
and
after
a
few
minutes
got
up
and
put
on
a
thin
jacket
on
deck
it
was
very
hot
and
he
felt
the
warmth
of
the
iron
plates
through
his
slippers
in
west
africa
one
puts
on
slippers
as
soon
as
one
gets
out
of
bed
for
fear
of
the
jigger
insect
that
bores
into
one
foot
a
gentle
land
breeze
blew
across
the
lagoon
and
the
air
was
hot
and
damp
like
steam
lister
smelt
river
mud
and
aromatic
forest
there
was
no
moon
but
he
saw
the
dark
hull
rise
and
fall
and
the
flash
of
phosphorescent
foam
where
the
swell
washed
across
the
deck
in
the
distance
the
surf
rumbled
and
now
and
then
there
was
a
peal
of
thunder
lister
wondered
why
he
had
left
his
berth
he
was
tired
and
needed
sleep
for
he
had
been
occupied
all
day
at
the
pump
which
was
not
running
well
recently
he
had
been
conscious
of
a
nervous
strain
and
things
that
were
not
important
annoyed
him
then
he
often
woke
at
night
feeling
that
some
danger
threatened
walking
along
the
deck
he
found
a
white
sailor
sitting
on
the
windlass
drum
the
man
did
not
move
until
lister
touched
his
arm
did
you
hear
something
not
very
long
since
watson
no
sir
said
the
other
with
a
start
now
and
then
a
fish
splashed
and
she
got
her
cable
across
the
stem
links
rattled
that
was
all
lister
thought
the
man
had
slept
but
it
was
not
important
since
there
was
no
obvious
necessity
for
keeping
anchor
watch
did
you
hear
something
sir
the
other
inquired
i
do
know
i
imagine
i
did
the
sailor
laughed
as
if
he
understood
a
queer
country
i
been
here
before
beautiful
bits
of
it
shining
surf
yellow
sands
and
palms
but
it
plays
some
funny
tricks
with
white
men
about
half
of
them
at
the
factories
get
addled
brains
if
they
stay
long
believe
in
things
the
bushmen
believe
ghosts
and
magic
and
such
perhaps
it
the
climate
but
on
this
coast
you
get
fancies
you
get
nowhere
else
sooner
take
on
the
in
a
north
sea
gale
than
keep
anchor
watch
in
an
african
calm
lister
nodded
he
thought
the
man
felt
lonely
and
wanted
to
talk
and
he
sympathized
there
was
something
insidious
and
daunting
about
the
african
coast
he
walked
round
the
deck
and
then
returning
to
his
room
presently
went
to
sleep
at
daybreak
he
heard
angry
voices
and
going
out
found
brown
storming
about
the
deck
two
white
sailors
had
come
back
in
the
boat
from
the
hulk
with
the
news
that
the
negroes
berthed
on
board
her
had
vanished
in
the
night
except
for
three
or
four
whom
the
sailors
had
brought
to
the
tug
when
brown
got
cooler
he
went
up
to
the
men
who
squatted
tranquilly
on
the
hatch
they
were
big
muscular
fellows
and
wore
instead
of
the
usual
piece
of
cotton
ragged
duck
clothes
where
the
rest
of
the
gang
brown
asked
no
savvy
sah
said
one
some
fella
put
them
on
him
and
he
lib
for
bush
what
a
lister
inquired
magic
of
a
sort
the
captain
growled
when
a
white
man
knows
much
about
his
proper
place
is
an
asylum
he
turned
to
the
boys
how
did
them
other
fellows
go
no
savvy
sah
we
done
hear
i
expect
they
were
afraid
to
meddle
brown
remarked
and
resumed
why
did
you
lib
for
stop
we
accra
boy
white
man
boy
them
bushman
him
d
n
fool
too
much
run
in
bush
like
monkey
without
him
brown
knitted
his
brows
and
then
made
a
sign
of
resignation
i
reckon
it
all
we
know
well
the
tide
falling
and
we
must
shift
for
some
kernels
before
the
sun
is
hot
better
start
your
pump
the
pump
was
soon
at
work
and
lister
watching
the
engine
mused
he
wondered
how
much
the
accra
boys
knew
or
if
it
was
possible
the
others
had
stolen
away
without
waking
them
watson
the
had
heard
nothing
and
lister
remembered
brown
remarks
about
the
and
thought
the
boys
did
know
something
but
were
afraid
to
tell
watson
had
said
the
country
was
queer
and
if
he
meant
fantastic
lister
agreed
there
was
something
about
it
that
strangely
on
imagination
in
the
north
american
wilds
one
was
so
to
speak
a
materialist
and
conquered
savage
nature
by
using
rules
in
africa
one
did
not
know
the
rules
and
felt
the
power
of
the
supernatural
it
looked
as
if
there
was
a
mysterious
malignant
force
but
the
pump
was
running
badly
and
lister
saw
he
must
not
philosophize
when
the
sun
got
hot
he
stopped
for
breakfast
and
afterwards
he
and
brown
smoked
for
a
few
minutes
under
the
awning
i
bothered
about
the
boys
going
the
captain
declared
there
not
much
doubt
montgomery
got
somebody
to
put
on
them
bribed
a
magician
to
frighten
them
by
a
trick
since
they
a
superstitious
lot
i
reckon
we
ca
hire
another
gang
in
this
neighborhood
however
now
he
stopped
our
coal
you
have
to
go
to
leone
and
may
pick
up
some
british
kroos
about
the
port
then
i
better
go
soon
said
lister
the
braces
i
bolted
on
the
pump
wo
hold
long
she
rocks
and
strains
the
shaft
when
she
running
hard
i
must
get
a
proper
casting
made
at
a
foundry
besides
the
engine
crosshead
worn
and
jumps
about
i
must
try
to
find
a
forge
and
they
got
something
of
the
kind
at
leone
i
do
know
about
a
foundry
brown
replied
take
learmont
to
navigate
and
start
when
you
like
we
shift
the
hulk
to
leeward
of
the
wreck
and
she
ought
to
ride
out
a
breeze
lister
sailed
a
few
days
afterwards
and
reaching
sierra
leone
found
nobody
could
make
the
articles
he
required
for
all
that
they
must
be
got
and
he
resolved
to
push
on
for
grand
canary
the
distance
was
long
he
had
not
men
enough
for
an
ocean
voyage
and
would
be
lucky
if
he
got
back
to
the
lagoon
in
three
or
four
weeks
but
if
he
could
not
mend
the
pump
the
salvage
work
must
stop
lister
knew
when
to
run
a
risk
was
justified
after
he
passed
the
gambier
wind
and
sea
were
ahead
his
crew
was
short
and
he
was
hard
pressed
to
keep
the
engine
going
and
watch
the
furnaces
he
slept
when
he
could
in
snatches
with
his
clothes
on
and
now
and
then
used
an
exhausted
fireman
shovel
on
the
steamy
african
coast
the
labor
and
watchfulness
would
have
worn
him
out
but
the
cool
trade
breeze
was
bracing
although
he
was
thin
and
got
thinner
the
lassitude
he
had
felt
at
the
lagoon
vanished
and
the
fatigue
he
fought
against
was
not
the
fatigue
that
kills
in
the
meantime
pushed
stubbornly
north
across
the
long
seas
that
broke
in
clouds
of
spray
against
her
thrusting
bows
she
was
swept
by
the
sparkling
showers
but
the
showers
were
warm
and
the
combers
were
not
often
steep
enough
to
flood
her
deck
for
all
that
their
impact
slowed
her
speed
she
must
be
driven
through
their
tumbling
crests
full
steam
was
needed
to
overcome
the
shock
and
the
men
moved
down
coal
from
the
stack
on
deck
to
feed
the
hungry
fires
lister
eyes
ached
from
the
glare
of
smoky
lamps
that
threw
puzzling
lights
about
the
machinery
after
long
balancing
on
slanted
platforms
his
back
and
legs
were
sore
his
brows
were
knit
in
a
steady
frown
and
his
mouth
was
always
firm
when
the
strain
was
over
he
sometimes
wondered
what
he
thought
about
in
the
long
exhausting
watches
but
remembered
nothing
except
his
obstinate
concentration
on
his
task
the
strange
thing
was
he
did
not
think
much
about
barbara
although
he
was
vaguely
conscious
that
for
her
sake
he
must
hold
out
he
meant
to
hold
out
perhaps
his
talents
were
not
numerous
but
he
could
handle
engines
and
when
it
was
necessary
he
could
keep
awake
at
length
learmont
called
him
one
morning
to
the
bridge
and
he
leaned
slackly
against
the
rails
his
eyes
were
dull
and
for
some
hours
he
had
breathed
the
fumes
of
burning
tallow
a
slide
had
given
him
trouble
he
could
keep
the
metal
cool
on
the
bridge
however
the
air
was
keen
and
sweet
and
he
felt
the
contrast
plunged
and
threw
the
spray
about
but
the
seas
were
short
as
if
something
ahead
broke
the
wind
by
and
by
learmont
indicated
a
lofty
bank
of
mist
teneriffe
he
said
i
was
when
i
took
the
sun
but
my
reckoning
was
not
very
far
out
lister
looked
up
in
the
distance
a
sharp
white
cone
rising
from
fleecy
vapor
cut
the
sky
and
lister
with
dull
satisfaction
knew
the
famous
peak
nearer
the
tug
was
another
bank
of
mist
that
looked
strangely
solid
but
ragged
as
if
it
were
wrapped
about
something
with
a
broken
outline
some
minutes
afterwards
a
high
dark
object
like
a
loomed
in
the
haze
grand
canary
learmont
remarked
the
range
behind
las
palmas
town
i
expect
the
smudge
ahead
is
the
isleta
hill
we
made
it
lister
said
hoarsely
and
braced
himself
now
the
strain
was
gone
he
felt
very
slack
the
sun
rose
out
of
the
water
the
mist
began
to
melt
and
rolling
back
uncovered
a
line
of
surf
and
a
belt
of
rough
hillside
then
volcanic
cliffs
a
sandy
isthmus
and
a
cluster
of
masts
and
funnels
got
distinct
and
lister
fixed
the
glasses
on
a
white
stripe
across
a
cinder
hill
his
hand
shook
but
he
steadied
the
glasses
and
saw
the
stripe
was
a
row
of
huge
letters
engineering
he
read
his
heart
beat
when
he
went
below
luck
had
given
him
a
hard
job
but
he
had
put
it
across
soon
after
arrived
he
went
to
the
engineering
company
office
and
the
manager
looked
at
him
curiously
then
he
gave
lister
some
wine
and
after
studying
his
drawings
and
patterns
said
he
could
make
the
things
required
lister
drove
to
the
town
and
going
to
a
spanish
barber
started
when
he
saw
his
reflection
in
a
glass
he
had
not
shaved
for
long
and
fresh
water
was
scarce
on
board
the
tug
his
face
was
haggard
the
engine
grime
had
got
into
his
skin
and
his
eyes
were
red
he
was
forced
to
wait
and
while
the
barber
attended
to
other
customers
he
fell
asleep
in
his
chair
when
he
left
the
shop
he
went
to
a
hotel
and
slept
for
twelve
hours
chapter
vi
lister
meets
an
old
antagonist
the
hotel
catalina
between
las
palmas
harbor
and
the
town
was
not
crowded
and
a
number
of
the
quests
had
gone
to
a
ball
at
the
neighboring
metropole
barbara
going
out
some
time
after
dinner
found
the
veranda
unoccupied
and
sat
down
cartwright
was
getting
better
and
did
not
need
her
and
barbara
was
satisfied
to
be
alone
her
thoughts
were
disturbing
and
trying
to
banish
them
for
a
few
minutes
she
looked
about
the
veranda
was
long
and
the
lights
from
the
hotel
threw
the
shadow
of
the
wooden
pillars
across
the
dusty
grass
barbara
figure
was
outlined
in
a
dark
silhouette
she
did
not
wear
a
hat
and
since
the
night
was
warm
had
put
nothing
over
her
thin
dinner
dress
she
looked
slender
and
very
young
a
strip
of
parched
garden
where
a
few
dusty
palms
grew
ran
down
to
the
road
across
which
the
square
block
of
the
metropole
cut
the
shining
sea
steamers
lights
swung
gently
against
the
dark
background
of
the
isleta
hill
beyond
the
metropole
a
white
belt
of
surf
ran
back
to
the
cluster
of
lights
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
that
marked
las
palmas
one
heard
the
languid
rollers
break
upon
the
beach
and
the
measured
crash
of
surges
on
the
reefs
across
the
isthmus
sometimes
when
the
throb
of
the
surf
sank
music
came
from
the
metropole
a
distant
rattle
indicated
a
going
to
the
port
the
long
line
across
the
harbor
was
the
mole
and
barbara
had
thought
the
small
steamer
lying
near
its
end
like
there
was
nothing
in
the
soft
blue
dark
behind
the
mole
until
one
came
to
the
african
coast
then
barbara
firmly
turned
her
glance
in
a
sense
she
had
sent
lister
to
africa
but
she
was
not
going
to
think
about
him
yet
she
must
not
think
about
him
until
she
had
weighed
something
else
a
few
hours
since
she
had
got
a
jar
walking
in
the
town
she
saw
a
man
whose
figure
and
step
she
thought
she
knew
he
was
some
distance
off
and
she
entered
a
shop
and
bought
a
spanish
fan
she
did
not
want
perhaps
her
disturbance
was
ridiculous
but
the
man
was
very
like
shillito
and
their
meeting
at
the
busy
port
was
not
impossible
las
palmas
was
something
like
an
important
railway
junction
numerous
steamers
called
and
passengers
from
all
quarters
particularly
south
america
and
the
west
indies
changed
boats
then
barbara
understood
that
a
fugitive
from
justice
was
safer
in
south
and
central
america
than
anywhere
else
she
wondered
with
keen
anxiety
whether
the
man
had
seen
her
she
knew
now
she
had
not
loved
shillito
he
had
cunningly
worked
upon
her
ignorance
discontent
and
longing
for
romance
illumination
had
come
on
board
the
train
but
although
she
had
found
him
out
and
escaped
she
had
afterwards
felt
herself
humiliated
and
set
apart
from
happy
girls
who
had
nothing
to
hide
the
humiliation
was
not
altogether
earned
and
the
people
who
knew
about
her
adventure
were
not
numerous
but
they
were
all
the
people
for
whom
she
cared
when
she
thought
about
it
she
hated
louis
shillito
the
stopped
at
the
metropole
and
went
on
to
the
port
trailing
a
cloud
of
dust
when
the
rattle
it
made
began
to
die
away
barbara
roused
herself
with
a
start
from
her
moody
thoughts
a
man
was
coming
up
the
path
and
when
he
reached
the
steps
she
shrank
back
against
the
wall
the
light
from
the
hotel
touched
his
face
and
she
saw
it
was
shillito
anger
conquered
her
shrinking
for
barbara
had
pluck
and
her
temper
was
hot
when
shillito
lifting
his
hat
advanced
she
got
up
and
stood
by
a
pillar
her
skin
had
gone
very
white
but
her
eyes
sparkled
and
her
hands
were
clenched
shillito
bowed
and
smiled
it
looks
as
if
i
was
lucky
he
remarked
and
barbara
imagined
his
not
finding
cartwright
about
accounted
for
his
satisfaction
i
suppose
you
saw
me
in
the
she
said
he
nodded
you
went
into
a
shop
your
object
was
pretty
obvious
i
allow
it
hurt
barbara
gave
him
a
scornful
glance
the
statement
ridiculous
do
you
imagine
you
can
cheat
me
now
as
you
cheated
me
in
canada
in
one
way
i
did
not
cheat
you
when
i
said
i
loved
you
i
was
honest
i
doubt
it
all
was
dishonest
from
the
beginning
you
taught
me
deceit
and
made
me
ashamed
for
my
shabbiness
for
your
sake
i
tricked
people
who
loved
and
trusted
me
but
to
you
i
was
rashly
sincere
i
trusted
you
and
was
willing
to
give
up
much
in
order
to
marry
you
you
mean
you
thought
you
were
willing
until
you
knew
the
cost
shillito
rejoined
then
you
saw
you
could
make
good
and
resolved
to
turn
me
down
the
blood
came
to
barbara
skin
but
she
fronted
him
steadily
i
had
you
had
you
been
something
of
the
man
i
thought
i
might
have
gone
with
you
and
helped
to
baffle
the
police
but
you
were
not
you
were
very
dull
and
played
a
stupid
part
when
you
thought
you
had
won
and
i
was
in
your
power
i
knew
you
for
a
brute
shillito
colored
but
forced
a
smile
perhaps
i
was
dull
i
was
desperate
you
had
kept
me
hanging
round
the
summer
camp
when
i
knew
the
police
were
on
my
track
and
i
had
been
put
wise
they
might
hold
up
the
train
a
man
hitting
the
trail
for
liberty
does
use
the
manners
of
a
highbrow
i
reckoned
you
were
human
and
your
blood
was
red
ah
said
barbara
i
was
very
human
although
i
was
afraid
i
felt
all
the
passion
hate
can
rouse
you
declared
i
must
stay
with
you
because
i
durst
not
go
back
i
had
broken
rules
and
my
fastidious
relations
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
me
something
like
that
in
a
sense
it
true
but
you
said
it
with
brutal
coarseness
when
i
struck
you
i
meant
to
hurt
i
looked
for
something
that
would
hurt
she
stopped
and
struggled
for
calm
to
indulge
her
anger
was
some
relief
but
she
felt
the
man
was
dangerous
and
she
must
be
cool
there
was
not
much
use
in
leaving
him
and
going
to
her
mother
because
he
would
no
doubt
follow
and
disturb
cartwright
it
was
unlucky
her
had
not
arrived
he
was
coming
out
but
his
boat
was
not
expected
for
a
day
or
two
oh
well
said
shillito
let
talk
about
something
else
i
calculate
to
meet
you
at
las
palmas
but
when
i
saw
you
in
the
i
hoped
you
might
after
all
be
kind
for
old
times
sake
however
obvious
you
have
no
use
for
me
and
if
you
are
willing
to
make
it
easier
i
pull
out
and
leave
you
alone
barbara
gave
him
a
keen
glance
she
had
known
he
wanted
something
how
can
i
make
it
easier
for
you
to
go
you
do
see
well
i
had
some
adventures
since
you
left
me
on
board
the
train
i
had
money
but
i
waited
too
long
to
negotiate
some
of
the
bonds
and
my
partner
robbed
me
i
made
san
francisco
and
found
nothing
doing
there
went
down
the
coast
to
chile
and
got
fixed
for
a
time
at
a
casino
in
which
i
invested
the
most
part
of
my
wad
one
night
a
chileno
pulled
his
knife
on
another
who
cleaned
him
out
and
when
the
police
got
busy
the
casino
shut
down
i
pushed
across
for
argentina
but
my
luck
was
good
and
i
made
las
palmas
not
long
since
on
board
an
italian
boat
on
the
whole
i
like
the
dagos
and
reckoned
i
might
try
cuba
or
perhaps
the
philippines
a
lopez
boat
sails
for
havana
in
two
or
three
days
barbara
interrupted
that
is
so
shillito
agreed
smiling
because
he
noted
her
relief
the
trouble
is
i
have
much
money
five
hundred
pounds
would
help
me
along
you
thought
i
would
give
you
five
hundred
pounds
sure
said
shillito
coolly
you
rich
anyhow
cartwright
is
rich
and
i
reckoned
you
would
see
my
staying
about
the
town
has
drawbacks
for
one
thing
the
english
tourists
are
a
gossiping
lot
it
ought
to
pay
you
and
your
mother
to
help
me
get
off
barbara
tried
to
think
the
drawbacks
shillito
indicated
were
plain
and
as
long
as
he
stayed
at
las
palmas
she
would
know
no
ease
of
mind
but
she
had
not
five
hundred
pounds
and
cartwright
must
not
be
disturbed
moreover
one
could
not
trust
the
fellow
he
might
take
the
money
and
then
use
his
power
again
he
had
power
to
humiliate
her
but
unless
she
was
willing
to
meet
all
his
claims
she
must
resist
some
time
i
imagine
you
put
your
importance
too
high
she
said
you
can
stay
if
you
like
i
certainly
will
not
bribe
you
to
go
away
he
studied
her
for
a
few
moments
barbara
looked
resolute
but
he
thought
her
resolution
forced
very
well
since
i
ca
start
for
cuba
without
money
i
must
find
an
occupation
at
las
palmas
and
i
have
a
plan
you
see
i
know
some
spanish
and
something
about
running
a
gambling
joint
the
people
here
are
sports
and
one
or
two
are
willing
to
put
up
the
money
to
start
a
club
that
ought
to
attract
the
english
tourists
if
i
found
the
thing
did
pay
before
you
went
back
i
could
quit
and
get
after
you
i
think
not
said
barbara
desperately
if
you
came
to
england
a
cablegram
to
the
canadian
police
shillito
laughed
you
would
send
a
cablegram
if
i
was
caught
i
could
tell
a
romantic
story
about
the
girl
who
helped
me
get
off
no
i
not
going
to
bother
about
your
putting
the
police
on
my
trail
he
turned
his
head
and
barbara
clenched
her
hand
for
a
rattle
of
wheels
in
the
road
broke
off
as
if
a
had
stopped
at
the
gate
if
the
passengers
from
the
vehicle
were
coming
to
the
hotel
she
must
get
rid
of
shillito
before
they
arrived
you
waste
your
arguments
she
declared
i
will
not
give
you
money
if
you
come
back
i
will
tell
the
you
are
annoying
me
and
he
must
not
let
you
in
the
plan
not
very
clever
shillito
rejoined
if
i
made
trouble
for
the
hotel
porters
the
guests
would
wonder
and
when
people
have
nothing
to
do
but
loaf
they
like
to
talk
i
expect
you
find
their
curiosity
awkward
he
paused
and
laughed
when
he
resumed
you
embarrassed
now
because
somebody
will
see
us
barbara
was
embarrassed
a
man
was
coming
up
the
path
and
she
knew
her
figure
and
shillito
cut
against
the
light
when
the
stranger
reached
the
veranda
he
would
see
she
was
disturbed
but
to
move
back
into
the
gloom
where
shillito
would
follow
her
would
be
significant
she
thought
he
meant
to
excite
the
other
curiosity
the
man
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
and
barbara
turned
her
head
since
she
imagined
he
would
think
she
was
quarreling
with
her
lover
then
he
ran
up
the
steps
and
when
he
stopped
in
front
of
shillito
her
heart
beat
fast
it
was
lister
and
she
knew
he
had
remarked
her
strained
look
for
his
face
was
very
stern
hallo
he
said
are
you
bothering
miss
hyslop
again
he
glanced
at
barbara
i
expect
the
fellow
is
bothering
you
for
a
moment
barbara
hesitated
but
she
had
borne
a
heavy
strain
and
her
control
was
going
besides
one
could
trust
lister
and
he
knew
she
signed
agreement
and
he
touched
shillito
get
off
the
veranda
shillito
did
not
move
his
pose
was
tense
and
he
looked
malevolent
you
wo
help
miss
hyslop
by
butting
in
like
a
clumsy
fool
the
thing
too
delicate
for
you
to
meddle
get
off
the
veranda
lister
shouted
and
threw
shillito
back
he
was
highly
strung
and
worn
by
want
of
sleep
and
exhausting
labor
but
he
had
some
notion
of
all
barbara
had
borne
on
shillito
account
although
perhaps
caution
and
tact
were
indicated
he
was
going
to
use
force
when
shillito
struck
him
he
seized
the
fellow
and
rocking
in
a
savage
grapple
they
fell
with
a
crash
against
the
rails
lister
felt
the
other
hand
at
his
throat
and
straining
back
jerked
his
head
away
while
he
tried
to
lift
his
antagonist
off
the
ground
he
pulled
him
from
the
rails
and
they
reeled
across
the
veranda
and
struck
the
wall
a
neighboring
window
rattled
with
the
shock
the
heavy
tramp
of
their
feet
shook
the
boards
and
barbara
knew
the
noise
would
soon
bring
a
group
of
curious
servants
to
the
door
besides
all
the
guests
had
not
gone
to
the
metropole
yet
she
could
not
meddle
the
men
passions
were
unloosed
they
fought
like
savage
animals
driven
by
an
instinctive
fury
that
would
not
vanish
until
one
was
beaten
she
looked
on
trembling
and
helpless
while
they
wrestled
with
swaying
bodies
and
hands
that
felt
for
a
firmer
hold
her
face
was
very
white
and
she
got
her
breath
in
painful
gasps
there
was
something
horribly
primitive
about
the
struggle
but
it
fascinated
in
the
meantime
lister
was
conscious
that
he
had
been
rash
shillito
was
muscular
and
fresh
but
he
was
tired
it
was
plain
he
could
not
keep
it
up
for
long
moreover
unless
the
fight
soon
ended
people
would
come
to
see
what
the
disturbance
was
about
this
would
be
awkward
for
barbara
he
wanted
to
tell
her
to
go
away
but
could
not
he
was
breathless
and
shillito
was
trying
to
choke
him
afterwards
he
knew
he
was
lucky
they
had
got
near
the
steps
and
he
threw
shillito
against
the
post
at
the
top
the
jar
shook
the
other
his
grasp
got
slack
and
lister
saw
that
for
a
moment
the
advantage
was
his
using
a
desperate
effort
he
pushed
his
antagonist
back
and
struck
him
a
smashing
blow
shillito
vanished
and
a
crash
in
the
gloom
indicated
that
he
had
fallen
on
an
aloe
in
a
tub
by
the
path
lister
leaned
against
the
rail
and
laughed
because
he
knew
aloe
spikes
are
sharp
then
he
heard
steps
and
voices
in
the
hotel
and
turned
to
barbara
his
face
was
cut
his
hat
was
gone
and
his
white
jacket
was
torn
he
looked
strangely
savage
and
disheveled
but
barbara
went
to
him
and
her
eyes
shone
lister
stopped
her
do
know
if
i
helped
much
but
you
must
get
off
he
gasped
people
are
coming
go
in
by
another
door
he
turned
and
plunged
down
the
stairs
and
barbara
seeing
that
shillito
had
vanished
ran
along
the
veranda
a
few
moments
afterwards
she
stood
by
the
window
of
her
room
and
saw
a
group
of
curious
servants
and
one
or
two
tourists
in
the
path
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
it
looked
as
if
they
were
puzzled
and
the
gravely
examined
battered
hat
barbara
went
from
the
window
and
sat
down
she
was
horribly
overstrained
and
wanted
to
cry
but
she
began
to
laugh
and
for
some
minutes
could
not
stop
she
must
get
relief
from
the
tension
and
after
all
in
a
sense
the
thing
was
humorous
chapter
vii
barbara
refusal
in
the
morning
barbara
went
to
the
catalina
mole
the
short
lava
pier
was
not
far
off
and
one
got
the
breeze
although
the
hotel
garden
was
hot
besides
she
did
not
want
to
meet
people
and
talk
about
the
strange
disturbance
on
the
veranda
on
the
whole
she
thought
nobody
imagined
she
could
satisfy
the
general
curiosity
finding
a
block
of
lava
in
the
shade
she
sat
down
and
looked
about
a
boat
crossed
the
harbor
mouth
swinging
up
on
the
smooth
swell
and
vanishing
when
the
undulations
rolled
by
a
tug
towed
a
row
of
barges
to
an
anchored
steamer
and
the
rattle
of
winches
came
down
the
wind
in
the
background
clouds
of
dust
blew
about
the
coaling
wharfs
and
a
string
of
flags
fluttered
from
the
staff
on
the
isleta
hill
barbara
beckoned
a
and
inquired
what
the
signal
meant
the
spaniard
said
an
african
from
england
was
coming
in
and
barbara
was
conscious
of
some
relief
cartwright
was
on
board
and
would
arrive
sooner
than
she
had
thought
the
boat
had
obviously
not
called
at
madeira
the
stated
cartwright
would
know
how
to
deal
with
shillito
if
he
bothered
her
again
in
the
meantime
she
mused
about
lister
she
had
thrilled
when
he
ran
up
the
steps
at
the
hotel
but
in
a
sense
his
arrival
just
then
was
awkward
she
turned
her
head
for
the
sunshine
on
the
water
dazzled
her
eyes
and
the
port
was
not
attractive
the
limekilns
and
shabby
lava
houses
had
for
a
background
volcanic
rocks
bare
cinder
slopes
and
tossing
dust
besides
she
wanted
to
think
she
would
see
lister
soon
she
wanted
to
see
him
but
she
shrank
for
one
thing
the
line
she
ought
to
take
was
hard
by
and
by
she
heard
a
rattle
of
oars
thrown
on
board
a
boat
behind
the
neighboring
wall
somebody
shouted
and
lister
came
up
his
white
clothes
were
clean
but
crumpled
and
barbara
smiled
when
she
saw
his
hat
was
new
crossing
the
lava
pavement
he
stopped
opposite
her
and
she
noted
a
piece
of
on
his
cheek
may
i
join
you
for
a
few
minutes
he
asked
of
course
she
said
graciously
lister
sat
down
the
sailors
had
gone
off
and
except
for
an
officer
of
the
nobody
was
about
i
was
going
to
the
hotel
to
look
for
you
for
one
thing
i
reckoned
i
ought
to
apologize
when
i
came
into
the
veranda
and
saw
shillito
i
think
you
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
barbara
remarked
he
colored
but
gave
her
a
steady
look
that
is
so
i
admit
the
ridiculous
but
at
first
i
felt
i
better
pull
out
then
i
noted
something
about
your
pose
you
looked
angry
ah
said
barbara
it
was
a
relief
to
see
i
was
angry
you
were
satisfied
then
i
was
really
satisfied
before
it
was
impossible
you
should
engage
a
brute
like
that
in
friendly
talk
anyhow
i
took
the
wrong
line
and
might
have
made
things
awkward
in
fact
the
situation
needed
a
lighter
touch
than
mine
all
the
same
when
i
saw
the
fellow
was
bullying
you
you
butted
in
barbara
suggested
smiling
although
her
heart
beat
like
a
bull
moose
said
lister
with
a
frown
i
ought
to
have
kept
cool
used
caution
and
frozen
him
off
by
a
few
short
arguments
you
can
picture
cartwright
putting
across
the
job
after
all
however
i
know
the
arguments
i
could
have
used
and
i
remembered
how
the
fellow
had
injured
you
he
saw
barbara
color
rise
and
stopped
for
a
moment
it
looked
as
if
he
had
not
used
much
caution
now
since
i
thought
you
in
africa
i
do
understand
how
you
arrived
she
began
the
thing
not
very
strange
said
lister
i
saw
your
name
in
a
visitors
list
and
meant
to
ask
for
you
in
the
morning
then
i
ran
up
against
shillito
who
did
know
me
and
when
he
got
on
board
the
steam
tram
i
hired
a
thought
he
might
mean
trouble
and
i
better
come
along
well
he
resumed
i
sorry
i
handled
the
job
clumsily
since
i
might
have
hurt
you
worse
but
i
hated
the
fellow
on
my
own
account
and
saw
red
perhaps
it
was
lucky
i
was
able
to
throw
him
down
the
steps
because
i
expect
neither
of
us
meant
to
quit
until
the
other
was
knocked
out
he
paused
and
added
with
a
laugh
now
i
cool
i
think
the
chances
were
i
got
knocked
out
last
time
we
met
he
threw
me
off
the
car
i
reckon
my
luck
has
turned
barbara
studied
him
and
was
moved
by
pity
and
some
other
emotions
he
was
very
thin
and
his
face
was
pinched
he
looked
as
if
he
were
exhausted
by
the
work
she
had
sent
him
to
do
barbara
admitted
that
she
had
sent
him
before
cartwright
planned
the
salvage
undertaking
she
had
declared
he
would
find
lister
the
man
for
an
awkward
job
you
ran
some
risk
for
my
sake
and
i
must
acknowledge
a
fresh
debt
she
said
i
would
sooner
be
your
debtor
than
another
but
sometimes
i
embarrassed
you
see
i
owe
you
so
much
you
have
paid
all
by
letting
me
know
you
lister
declared
she
was
quiet
for
a
few
moments
and
then
asked
are
you
making
much
progress
at
the
wreck
our
progress
is
slow
but
we
are
getting
there
lister
replied
and
seeing
her
interest
narrated
his
and
brown
struggles
and
his
long
voyage
with
a
short
crew
on
board
the
tug
the
story
was
moving
and
barbara
eyes
sparkled
lister
had
borne
much
and
done
all
that
flesh
and
blood
could
do
he
was
the
man
she
had
thought
and
she
knew
it
was
for
her
sake
that
he
had
labored
it
a
splendid
fight
she
said
we
have
won
yet
he
replied
and
was
quiet
for
a
few
moments
then
his
look
got
very
resolute
and
he
went
on
all
the
same
if
the
thing
is
anyhow
possible
i
going
to
win
you
see
i
got
to
win
when
cartwright
engaged
me
i
was
engineer
on
board
a
cattle
boat
a
man
of
no
importance
without
friends
or
money
and
with
no
particular
chance
of
making
good
now
i
got
my
chance
if
we
put
across
the
job
a
big
salvage
company
turned
down
i
make
my
mark
somebody
will
give
me
a
good
post
i
have
got
my
foot
on
the
ladder
that
leads
to
the
top
i
wish
you
luck
said
barbara
i
expect
you
will
get
near
the
top
if
you
are
willing
you
can
help
ah
said
barbara
with
forced
quietness
i
think
not
he
stopped
her
i
did
expect
to
find
you
willing
my
business
is
to
persuade
you
and
i
mean
to
try
well
i
was
boasting
and
my
drawbacks
are
plain
but
if
i
make
good
in
africa
some
will
be
cut
out
and
you
can
help
me
remove
the
others
i
long
wanted
you
and
now
my
luck
turning
i
was
going
to
catalina
to
tell
you
so
if
brown
and
i
float
will
you
marry
me
barbara
color
came
and
went
but
she
said
quietly
when
you
came
to
the
hotel
in
the
evening
you
met
shillito
i
did
said
lister
with
incautious
passion
if
i
had
killed
the
brute
i
have
been
justified
however
i
threw
him
on
to
the
aloe
tub
and
ran
off
the
thing
was
grotesquely
humorous
a
boy
fool
trick
you
ran
off
for
my
sake
said
barbara
i
liked
you
for
it
i
like
you
for
many
things
but
i
will
not
marry
you
he
saw
she
was
resolute
her
mouth
was
firm
and
her
hand
was
tightly
closed
he
thought
he
knew
the
grounds
for
her
refusal
and
his
heart
sank
barbara
was
stubborn
and
very
proud
moreover
the
situation
was
awkward
but
the
awkwardness
must
be
fronted
let
be
frank
perhaps
you
owe
me
this
he
urged
since
you
allow
you
do
like
me
what
to
stop
our
marrying
for
one
thing
my
adventure
in
canada
she
replied
and
turned
her
head
lister
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
and
forced
her
to
look
up
now
clean
ridiculous
shillito
cheated
you
he
a
plausible
wastrel
but
you
found
him
out
it
does
count
at
all
besides
nobody
but
your
relations
know
you
know
said
barbara
and
getting
up
started
along
the
mole
lister
tried
to
brace
himself
for
he
saw
she
could
not
be
moved
yet
there
was
something
to
be
said
you
are
the
girl
i
mean
to
marry
he
declared
some
day
perhaps
you
see
you
indulging
a
blamed
extravagant
illusion
and
i
going
to
wait
when
you
logical
i
try
again
barbara
forced
a
smile
sometimes
i
am
logical
i
feel
i
logical
now
but
i
have
left
my
mother
alone
rather
long
and
you
must
let
me
go
lister
went
with
her
to
the
road
and
got
on
a
tram
going
to
the
town
he
was
hurt
and
angry
but
not
altogether
daunted
barbara
ridiculous
pride
might
break
and
she
was
worth
waiting
for
when
he
returned
on
board
a
small
african
liner
had
anchored
not
far
off
and
while
he
watched
the
boats
that
swarmed
about
the
ship
one
left
the
others
and
came
towards
the
tug
the
spanish
crew
were
pulling
hard
and
a
passenger
occupied
the
stern
learmont
lounging
near
turned
his
glasses
on
the
boat
i
not
sorry
you
are
boss
he
said
the
old
man
is
coming
a
few
minutes
afterwards
cartwright
got
over
the
tug
rail
his
face
was
red
and
he
looked
very
stern
why
have
you
left
the
wreck
he
asked
lister
i
came
for
some
castings
i
could
get
at
sierra
leone
the
pump
and
engine
needed
mending
then
where
brown
he
busy
at
the
lagoon
sir
there
enough
to
keep
him
occupied
unless
the
pump
plays
out
before
i
get
back
cartwright
looked
relieved
but
asked
meaningly
did
you
know
cartwright
and
miss
hyslop
were
at
las
palmas
i
did
not
know
until
yesterday
evening
hours
after
i
arrived
but
we
talk
about
this
again
i
expect
you
want
to
know
how
we
are
getting
on
at
the
wreck
cartwright
nodded
i
think
my
curiosity
is
natural
let
get
out
of
the
sun
and
if
you
have
liquor
on
board
order
me
a
drink
when
the
steamed
round
the
mole
and
i
saw
i
got
a
nasty
jolt
lister
took
him
to
the
captain
room
and
gave
him
some
sour
red
canary
wine
cartwright
drained
his
glass
and
looked
up
with
an
ironical
smile
if
you
use
stuff
like
this
brown
ought
not
to
be
tempted
much
however
you
can
tell
me
what
you
have
done
at
the
lagoon
and
the
difficulties
you
have
met
you
need
bother
to
smooth
down
extravagances
i
knew
the
captain
before
i
knew
you
lister
told
his
story
and
when
he
stopped
cartwright
filled
his
glass
raised
it
to
his
lips
and
put
it
back
with
a
frown
send
somebody
along
the
mole
to
garcia
shop
for
two
or
three
bottles
of
his
amontillado
and
white
muscatel
charge
the
stuff
to
victualing
when
you
got
brown
out
of
the
factory
did
you
think
it
possible
he
had
a
private
stock
of
liquor
i
satisfied
he
had
not
montgomery
gave
him
the
liquor
and
i
imagine
meant
to
give
him
too
much
it
looks
like
that
cartwright
agreed
if
we
take
something
i
suspect
for
granted
montgomery
opposition
would
be
logical
i
imagine
you
know
part
of
the
cargo
was
worth
much
expensive
stuff
in
small
bulk
you
see
i
have
studied
the
and
plans
of
the
holds
sir
cartwright
nodded
we
find
out
presently
if
my
notion
how
the
boat
was
lost
is
accurate
the
cargo
another
thing
there
may
have
been
conspiracy
between
merchant
and
i
do
know
yet
but
if
it
was
conspiracy
this
would
account
for
much
some
of
the
gum
shipped
was
very
costly
and
african
alluvial
gold
washed
by
the
negroes
has
been
found
mixed
with
brass
filings
montgomery
frankly
stated
his
father
loaded
the
vessel
his
frankness
may
have
been
calculated
cartwright
rejoined
and
knitted
his
brows
yet
i
admit
the
young
fellow
name
is
good
at
liverpool
and
all
he
sells
is
up
to
sample
his
father
was
another
sort
but
he
died
and
the
house
is
now
well
run
however
in
the
meantime
we
let
it
go
he
looked
up
for
a
fireman
carrying
a
basket
came
in
cartwright
took
the
basket
and
opened
a
bottle
of
white
wine
take
some
of
this
he
said
i
understand
you
have
seen
mrs
cartwright
not
yet
sir
said
lister
quietly
i
met
miss
hyslop
soon
before
your
boat
arrived
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
i
asked
her
if
she
would
marry
me
if
we
floated
the
wreck
ah
said
cartwright
but
why
did
you
add
the
stipulation
it
ought
to
be
obvious
if
we
put
the
undertaking
over
i
expect
to
get
a
post
that
will
enable
me
to
support
a
wife
although
she
might
be
forced
to
go
without
things
i
like
to
give
her
i
see
said
cartwright
with
some
dryness
well
i
do
know
if
barbara
is
extravagant
but
she
has
not
used
much
economy
was
she
willing
to
take
the
plunge
she
was
not
sir
then
i
suppose
she
stated
her
grounds
for
refusing
that
is
so
said
lister
perhaps
miss
hyslop
will
tell
you
what
they
are
i
will
not
cartwright
looked
at
him
hard
all
the
same
i
imagine
you
did
not
agree
i
did
not
agree
if
i
make
good
at
the
wreck
i
will
try
again
barbara
is
pretty
obstinate
cartwright
remarked
with
a
smile
and
then
filled
lister
glass
i
must
go
but
come
to
the
hotel
in
the
morning
we
must
talk
about
the
salvage
plans
he
went
off
but
when
the
boat
crossed
the
harbor
he
looked
back
at
the
tug
with
twinkling
eyes
lister
was
honest
and
had
not
asked
barbara
to
marry
him
until
he
saw
some
chance
of
his
supporting
a
wife
since
barbara
was
rich
the
thing
was
amusing
all
the
same
it
was
possible
the
young
fellow
must
wait
barbara
exaggerated
and
indulged
her
imagination
but
she
was
firm
chapter
viii
cartwright
gets
to
work
the
morning
was
hot
and
barbara
sitting
on
the
hotel
veranda
struggled
against
a
flat
reaction
the
glitter
of
the
sea
hurt
her
eyes
and
the
dust
that
blew
in
clouds
from
the
road
smeared
her
white
dress
her
mouth
dropped
and
her
pose
was
languid
to
refuse
lister
had
cost
her
much
and
although
she
had
done
so
because
she
felt
she
ought
the
sense
of
having
carried
out
a
duty
was
not
remarkably
soothing
it
was
a
relief
to
know
she
need
not
pretend
to
cartwright
who
occupied
a
opposite
one
could
not
cheat
her
by
false
cheerfulness
when
you
disappointed
lister
you
took
the
prudent
line
he
said
the
young
fellow
has
some
talent
but
he
has
not
yet
made
his
mark
i
approve
your
caution
and
expect
your
mother
will
agree
i
was
cautious
i
did
argue
at
all
like
that
barbara
declared
besides
i
have
told
mother
she
must
be
disturbed
cartwright
looked
thoughtful
to
some
extent
he
was
sympathetic
and
to
some
extent
amused
then
i
do
altogether
understand
why
you
did
refuse
oh
well
said
barbara
and
the
blood
came
to
her
skin
for
one
thing
lister
waited
for
some
time
and
then
asked
me
to
marry
him
after
shillito
arrived
she
paused
and
her
look
got
hard
when
she
resumed
perhaps
he
thought
he
ought
sometimes
he
chivalrous
cartwright
imagined
barbara
was
badly
hurt
and
this
accounted
for
her
frankness
your
reasoning
is
very
obvious
but
i
think
i
see
a
light
he
said
it
possible
however
he
asked
you
because
he
wanted
you
and
there
is
an
explanation
for
his
waiting
i
understand
he
hesitated
because
he
doubted
if
he
could
support
a
wife
it
looks
as
if
lister
know
you
were
rich
he
does
know
i
think
i
did
want
him
to
know
barbara
admitted
with
some
embarrassment
shillito
knew
but
one
learns
caution
cartwright
remarked
well
shillito
became
somewhat
of
a
nuisance
and
i
do
imagine
you
want
him
to
look
us
up
again
i
rather
think
i
must
get
to
work
i
hate
him
said
barbara
passionately
until
your
boat
was
signaled
i
was
horribly
alarmed
but
then
the
trouble
went
i
felt
i
bother
after
you
arrived
her
voice
softened
as
she
added
you
are
a
clever
old
dear
one
feels
safe
while
you
about
thank
you
said
cartwright
i
am
old
but
i
have
some
useful
talents
well
is
there
something
else
about
which
you
want
to
talk
barbara
hesitated
there
was
something
for
which
she
meant
to
ask
although
her
object
was
not
very
plain
perhaps
shillito
demand
for
money
had
made
her
feel
its
power
moreover
she
was
independent
and
liked
to
control
her
affairs
my
birthday
was
not
long
since
and
i
entitled
to
use
some
of
the
money
that
is
mine
that
is
so
cartwright
agreed
with
a
twinkle
all
the
same
not
entitled
to
use
much
until
you
marry
and
you
have
just
sent
off
one
lover
would
you
like
me
to
send
you
out
a
sum
i
think
i
like
a
check
book
and
then
i
need
bother
people
cartwright
nodded
barbara
was
not
extravagant
very
well
i
expect
we
can
trust
you
and
the
money
is
yours
i
can
probably
arrange
for
a
business
house
to
meet
your
drafts
i
see
about
it
when
i
in
the
town
he
started
for
las
palmas
presently
and
after
some
inquiries
stopped
at
a
spanish
hotel
where
he
found
shillito
the
latter
frowned
when
he
saw
cartwright
but
went
with
him
to
the
courtyard
and
they
sat
down
in
the
shade
have
you
bought
your
ticket
for
havana
cartwright
asked
i
have
not
said
shillito
so
far
i
have
decided
to
leave
las
palmas
then
i
imagine
you
had
better
decide
if
money
is
a
difficulty
i
might
lend
you
enough
for
a
passage
but
that
is
all
shillito
smiled
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
you
have
to
go
higher
i
reckon
it
worth
while
i
think
not
said
cartwright
dryly
in
fact
since
i
can
get
rid
of
you
for
nothing
i
doubt
if
it
worth
the
price
of
a
cheap
berth
on
board
the
lopez
boat
however
i
risk
this
in
order
to
save
bothering
bluff
you
can
cut
it
out
and
get
to
business
very
well
your
call
at
the
catalina
did
help
you
much
and
if
you
come
again
you
will
not
be
received
by
miss
hyslop
but
by
me
i
have
met
and
beaten
fellows
like
you
before
my
offer
a
berth
you
had
better
take
it
not
at
all
said
shillito
before
long
you
want
to
raise
your
bid
cartwright
got
up
and
crossed
the
flags
the
other
frowned
and
hesitated
but
let
him
go
when
he
reached
the
street
cartwright
called
his
and
told
the
driver
to
take
him
to
the
british
the
was
a
merchant
who
sometimes
supplied
the
cartwright
boats
with
stores
and
he
gave
his
visitor
a
cigar
cartwright
told
him
as
much
about
shillito
as
he
thought
useful
and
the
weighed
his
remarks
the
extradition
of
a
criminal
is
a
long
and
troublesome
business
he
observed
in
the
meantime
the
fellow
must
not
be
allowed
to
annoy
you
and
i
imagine
my
duty
is
to
inform
the
spanish
don
ramon
is
tactful
and
i
think
will
handle
the
situation
discreetly
suppose
we
go
to
see
him
he
took
cartwright
to
an
old
spanish
house
with
the
royal
arms
above
the
door
and
a
very
dignified
gentleman
received
them
politely
he
allowed
the
to
tell
cartwright
story
in
castilian
and
then
smiled
señor
graham
has
our
thanks
for
the
warning
he
has
brought
he
said
in
this
island
we
are
sportsmen
we
have
our
cockpits
and
casinos
but
our
aim
is
to
develop
our
commerce
and
not
make
the
town
a
monte
carlo
then
the
play
at
the
casinos
must
be
honest
our
way
with
cardsharpers
is
stern
the
eyes
twinkled
he
knew
don
ramon
who
resumed
señor
cartwright
duty
is
to
inform
the
british
police
no
doubt
he
will
do
so
but
until
they
apply
to
our
in
the
proper
form
i
can
not
put
in
prison
a
british
subject
for
a
robbery
he
did
not
commit
on
spanish
soil
perhaps
however
this
is
not
necessary
on
the
whole
i
do
think
it
is
necessary
cartwright
remarked
the
fellow
is
a
dangerous
scoundrel
but
i
do
know
that
it
is
my
duty
to
give
you
the
bother
extradition
formalities
would
imply
still
you
may
find
him
a
nuisance
if
he
stays
long
don
ramon
smiled
i
imagine
he
will
not
stay
long
my
post
gives
me
power
to
deal
with
troublesome
foreigners
well
i
thank
you
and
can
promise
you
will
not
be
disturbed
again
he
let
them
go
and
when
they
went
out
the
laughed
you
can
trust
don
ramon
for
one
thing
he
knows
i
have
some
claim
in
this
country
a
merchant
finds
it
pays
to
acknowledge
fair
treatment
by
the
men
who
rule
for
all
that
don
ramon
is
just
and
uses
prudently
a
power
we
do
not
give
british
officials
the
spanish
know
the
advantages
of
firm
control
and
i
admit
their
plan
works
well
shillito
did
not
return
to
the
catalina
when
he
was
playing
cards
for
high
stakes
one
evening
two
entered
the
gambling
house
and
one
touched
shillito
arm
you
will
come
with
us
señor
he
said
politely
shillito
pushed
back
his
chair
and
looked
about
the
man
carried
a
pistol
and
the
civil
guards
have
power
to
shoot
his
comrade
watched
the
door
what
is
your
authority
for
bothering
me
he
asked
it
is
possible
don
ramon
will
tell
you
he
is
waiting
said
the
other
he
took
shillito
to
the
house
with
the
coat
of
arms
and
don
ramon
sending
off
the
guards
indicated
a
chair
we
have
heard
something
about
you
and
do
not
think
you
ought
to
remain
at
las
palmas
he
remarked
in
fact
since
we
understand
you
meant
to
go
to
cuba
we
expect
you
to
start
by
the
lopez
boat
i
do
mean
to
go
to
cuba
shillito
rejoined
don
ramon
shrugged
well
we
do
not
mind
if
you
sail
for
another
country
numerous
steamers
touch
here
and
the
choice
is
yours
so
long
as
you
leave
las
palmas
shillito
looked
at
him
hard
i
am
a
british
subject
and
stay
where
i
like
you
are
obstinate
señor
but
i
think
your
statement
rash
don
ramon
observed
a
british
subject
is
governed
by
british
laws
but
we
will
not
talk
about
this
he
paused
and
studied
shillito
who
began
to
look
disturbed
one
would
sooner
be
polite
and
take
the
easy
line
don
ramon
resumed
so
far
this
is
possible
because
you
are
not
on
the
list
sent
our
government
by
the
british
police
but
we
have
power
to
examine
foreigners
about
whom
we
are
not
satisfied
well
i
doubt
if
you
could
satisfy
us
that
you
ought
to
remain
and
when
we
begin
to
investigate
a
demand
for
your
extradition
might
arrive
if
you
forced
us
to
inquire
about
you
a
cablegram
would
soon
reach
london
shillito
saw
he
was
beaten
and
got
up
i
buy
my
ticket
for
havana
in
the
morning
he
replied
the
lopez
liner
was
some
days
late
and
in
the
meantime
lister
haunted
the
office
of
the
engineering
company
at
length
the
articles
he
needed
were
ready
and
one
afternoon
cartwright
hired
a
boat
to
take
him
and
barbara
across
the
harbor
lay
with
full
steam
up
at
the
end
of
the
long
mole
and
when
her
winch
began
to
rattle
cartwright
told
the
spanish
to
stop
rowing
the
tug
mooring
ropes
splashed
her
propeller
throbbed
and
she
swung
away
from
the
wall
she
was
rusty
and
dingy
the
screens
along
her
bridge
were
cracked
and
burned
by
the
sun
the
boat
at
her
rail
was
blackened
by
soot
and
when
she
rolled
the
weed
streamed
down
from
her
she
looked
very
small
and
overloaded
by
the
stack
of
coal
on
deck
the
wash
round
her
stern
got
whiter
ripples
ran
back
from
her
bows
and
when
she
steamed
near
cartwright
boat
her
whistle
shrieked
cartwright
stood
up
and
waved
learmont
on
the
bridge
touched
his
cap
but
for
a
few
moments
barbara
fixed
her
eyes
on
deckhouse
then
she
blushed
and
her
heart
beat
for
she
saw
lister
at
the
door
of
the
he
saw
her
and
smiled
the
tug
whistle
was
drowned
by
a
deeper
blast
a
big
liner
painted
black
from
to
was
coming
out
and
boat
lay
between
her
and
the
tug
barbara
gave
the
great
ship
a
careless
glance
and
then
started
for
she
read
the
name
at
the
bow
this
was
the
havana
boat
studying
the
groups
of
passengers
at
the
rails
she
thought
she
saw
a
face
she
knew
the
face
got
distinct
and
when
the
liner
lofty
side
towered
above
the
boat
shillito
looking
down
lifted
his
cap
and
bowed
with
ironical
politeness
barbara
turned
her
head
and
tried
for
calm
while
she
watched
the
tug
lister
had
not
gone
barbara
knew
he
would
not
go
so
long
as
he
could
see
the
boat
and
standing
up
with
her
hand
on
cartwright
shoulder
she
waved
her
handkerchief
lister
hand
went
to
his
cap
but
he
was
getting
indistinct
and
had
begun
to
plunge
on
the
long
swell
outside
the
wall
she
steered
for
open
sea
the
big
black
liner
followed
the
coast
and
presently
cartwright
signed
the
men
to
pull
then
he
looked
at
barbara
and
smiled
for
he
knew
she
had
seen
shillito
things
do
sometimes
happen
like
that
he
said
i
think
the
fellow
has
gone
for
good
but
the
other
will
come
back
chapter
ix
lister
makes
good
holds
were
empty
and
a
long
row
of
oil
puncheons
occupied
the
beach
but
the
men
who
had
dragged
the
goods
from
the
water
were
exhausted
by
heavy
toil
in
the
scorching
sun
and
some
were
sick
the
divers
had
bolted
on
plates
to
cover
the
holes
in
the
vessel
bilge
before
one
fell
ill
and
his
mate
nerve
went
the
heat
and
poisonous
vapors
from
the
swamps
had
broken
his
health
and
he
got
a
bad
jar
one
day
his
entangled
and
the
dragged
him
unconscious
to
the
top
afterwards
for
the
most
part
lister
undertook
the
diving
but
for
long
his
efforts
to
reach
the
floor
of
the
were
baffled
to
crawl
across
slanted
gratings
and
down
weedy
ladders
while
and
trailed
about
the
machinery
was
horribly
dangerous
but
he
kept
it
up
although
he
got
slacker
and
felt
his
pluck
was
breaking
then
one
afternoon
he
knew
he
could
not
go
down
again
and
he
stayed
under
water
long
brown
standing
by
the
looked
at
his
watch
and
waited
anxiously
the
bubbles
broke
the
surface
above
the
wreck
and
the
was
slack
but
lister
had
been
down
longer
than
he
ought
he
wars
not
a
diver
and
the
others
who
knew
their
job
had
come
up
sooner
then
brown
had
other
grounds
for
anxiety
if
lister
were
beaten
their
chance
of
floating
the
wreck
was
small
at
length
the
bubbles
began
to
move
towards
the
hulk
the
ladder
shook
and
a
dull
red
reflection
shone
through
the
water
then
the
copper
helmet
broke
the
surface
rose
a
few
inches
and
stopped
and
brown
ran
to
the
gangway
lister
was
exhausted
and
his
body
could
not
meet
the
change
of
pressure
they
dragged
him
on
board
and
took
off
his
helmet
and
canvas
dress
for
some
minutes
he
lay
like
a
log
and
then
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
brown
cartwright
was
on
the
track
he
gasped
we
can
go
ahead
the
sun
was
low
but
the
pitch
in
the
seams
was
liquid
and
smeared
the
hot
planks
and
brown
pulled
lister
into
the
shade
for
a
time
he
was
quiet
but
by
and
by
he
said
when
the
tide
falls
we
start
the
pump
and
let
her
go
all
night
i
must
get
up
and
tell
jones
to
clean
the
fire
i
tell
him
you
stay
there
until
we
get
some
food
brown
replied
the
cook
served
the
meal
on
deck
but
they
had
hardly
begun
when
he
lighted
a
as
soon
as
the
red
sun
dipped
thick
vapor
floated
off
from
the
swamps
the
water
got
oily
black
and
dark
clouds
rolled
across
the
sky
flickering
lightning
illumined
the
tumbling
surf
and
sandy
beach
but
there
was
no
thunder
and
the
night
was
calm
the
hulk
and
tug
were
moored
at
opposite
sides
of
the
wreck
forward
of
her
engine
room
and
thick
wire
ropes
that
ran
between
them
had
been
dragged
back
under
the
vessel
for
some
distance
from
her
bow
the
ropes
however
were
not
yet
hauled
tight
when
the
cook
took
away
the
plates
brown
made
a
rough
calculation
we
have
caulked
all
hatches
and
gratings
forward
and
stopped
the
ventilators
he
said
i
reckon
the
water
will
leave
the
deck
long
enough
for
the
pump
to
give
her
some
buoyancy
if
she
rises
with
the
flood
tide
well
heave
the
cables
aft
until
we
can
get
a
hold
that
will
lift
her
bow
from
the
ground
then
you
can
pump
out
the
fore
hold
and
we
make
a
fresh
start
aft
we
soon
know
if
notion
is
correct
we
know
i
satisfy
you
in
the
morning
lister
rejoined
and
his
confidence
was
not
exaggerated
a
steamer
hull
below
her
is
pierced
in
places
to
admit
water
for
the
condensers
and
ballast
tanks
lister
had
found
some
inlets
open
but
now
they
were
shut
i
own
old
cartwright
a
great
man
brown
said
thoughtfully
when
he
takes
on
a
job
he
studies
things
all
round
the
salvage
folks
no
doubt
reckoned
on
the
possibility
that
the
valves
were
open
but
they
could
get
at
the
controls
and
did
know
all
cartwright
knew
he
paused
and
added
with
a
laugh
i
wonder
how
much
the
other
fellows
got
for
the
job
but
it
time
we
started
lister
got
up
with
an
effort
and
went
to
the
pump
which
presently
began
to
throb
the
mended
engine
ran
well
and
the
regular
splash
of
water
flung
out
from
the
big
discharge
pipe
drowned
the
languid
rumble
of
the
surf
the
hull
shook
shadowy
figures
crossed
the
beam
of
light
from
the
furnace
and
vanished
in
the
dark
twinkling
lamps
threw
broken
reflections
on
the
water
that
looked
like
black
silk
lightning
flashed
in
the
background
and
when
the
swell
broke
with
phosphorescent
sparkles
about
the
wreck
lister
marked
the
height
the
pale
illumination
crept
up
her
plates
she
would
not
lift
that
tide
but
the
pump
was
clearing
the
hold
and
he
hoped
much
water
was
not
coming
in
if
the
leakage
was
not
excessive
her
bow
ought
to
rise
when
the
next
tide
flowed
for
some
hours
he
kept
his
watch
dragging
himself
wearily
about
the
engine
and
pump
he
had
helpers
but
control
was
his
and
to
an
engineer
a
machine
is
not
a
dead
mass
of
metal
lister
so
to
speak
felt
the
pump
had
individuality
and
temperament
like
a
spirited
horse
sometimes
it
must
be
humored
and
sometimes
urged
it
would
run
faster
for
a
man
whose
touch
was
firm
but
light
than
for
another
perhaps
he
was
fanciful
and
he
was
certainly
but
he
imagined
the
big
rattling
machine
knew
his
hand
at
length
when
he
looked
at
the
gauge
glass
he
found
he
could
not
see
the
line
that
marked
the
his
head
swam
and
his
legs
shook
and
calling
a
fireman
to
keep
watch
he
sat
down
in
the
coal
he
wanted
to
get
to
the
awning
out
of
the
dew
but
could
not
and
leaning
against
the
rough
blocks
he
went
to
sleep
in
the
morning
he
knew
the
fever
that
bothered
him
now
and
then
had
returned
for
all
that
he
must
hold
out
and
he
began
his
labor
in
the
burning
sun
when
the
flood
tide
rippled
about
the
wreck
it
was
obvious
the
pump
was
getting
the
water
down
the
bows
lifted
and
starting
the
winches
they
hauled
aft
the
ropes
if
they
could
keep
it
before
long
they
might
heave
her
from
the
sand
it
was
a
time
of
stubborn
effort
and
crushing
strain
some
of
the
men
were
sick
and
all
had
lost
their
vigor
the
fierce
sun
had
not
burned
but
bleached
their
skin
their
blood
was
poisoned
by
the
miasma
the
land
breeze
blew
off
at
night
for
all
that
cartwright
promise
was
they
should
share
his
reward
and
somehow
they
held
on
at
length
in
the
scorching
heat
one
afternoon
when
the
flood
tide
began
to
run
they
hauled
the
hulk
and
tug
abaft
the
wreck
and
made
the
great
ropes
fast
if
lister
calculations
were
accurate
the
pump
had
thrown
out
enough
water
and
the
buoyancy
of
the
other
craft
would
lift
the
wreck
stern
if
not
but
he
refused
to
think
about
this
the
sea
breeze
had
dropped
and
the
smoke
of
the
engine
went
straight
up
there
was
not
a
line
on
the
glittering
lagoon
the
sea
looked
like
melted
silver
one
felt
it
give
out
light
and
heat
the
men
eyes
ached
and
the
intolerable
sun
pierced
their
double
hats
and
dulled
their
brains
when
all
was
ready
they
waited
and
watched
the
sandy
water
creep
up
plates
until
the
ropes
stretched
and
groaned
and
the
hulk
began
to
list
on
the
wreck
other
side
the
tug
mast
and
funnel
slanted
was
not
yet
afloat
and
the
big
running
beneath
her
bilge
held
down
the
helping
craft
the
ends
were
made
fast
by
hemp
lashings
and
somebody
had
put
an
ax
beside
the
post
for
all
that
lister
did
not
think
brown
would
give
the
order
to
cut
he
himself
would
not
if
they
did
not
float
arcturus
now
she
must
remain
in
the
sand
for
good
he
would
hold
on
until
the
rising
tide
flowed
across
the
tug
in
the
meantime
he
watched
the
pump
the
engine
carried
a
dangerous
load
and
the
spouting
discharge
pipe
was
swollen
throbbing
and
rattling
she
fought
the
water
that
held
down
a
greaser
touched
the
with
a
tallow
swab
and
a
panting
fireman
thrust
a
bar
through
the
furnace
door
their
skin
was
blackened
by
sweat
and
coal
dust
soaked
singlets
tight
like
gloves
clung
to
their
lean
bodies
nobody
else
however
was
actively
occupied
the
negroes
lay
on
the
deck
and
the
white
men
lounged
in
the
shade
of
the
awning
they
had
done
all
that
flesh
and
blood
could
do
in
a
climate
that
breaks
the
white
man
strength
and
now
the
tide
ought
to
finish
their
labor
but
they
did
not
know
and
some
doubted
the
ropes
cracked
and
the
hulk
list
got
sharp
on
one
side
her
deck
was
very
near
the
water
she
was
broad
but
if
did
not
lift
it
was
obvious
she
must
soon
capsize
lister
opened
the
engine
throttle
until
the
would
not
turn
the
cylinders
shook
a
gland
blew
steam
and
the
pump
clashed
and
rocked
all
the
same
he
knew
himself
ridiculous
the
extra
water
the
pump
lifted
would
not
help
much
now
they
had
a
few
minutes
and
then
if
nobody
cut
the
ropes
the
hulk
would
go
down
the
massive
oak
groaned
and
the
opened
with
the
strain
the
were
rigid
one
could
see
no
hint
of
curve
the
water
touched
the
hulk
deck
and
began
to
creep
up
then
it
stopped
the
hulk
shook
and
the
wreck
long
side
slowly
got
upright
she
off
said
brown
hoarsely
somebody
blew
the
tug
whistle
and
one
or
two
shouted
but
this
was
all
they
had
won
a
very
stubborn
fight
but
winning
had
cost
them
much
and
lister
felt
their
triumph
was
strangely
flat
he
smiled
and
owned
he
would
be
satisfied
to
lie
down
and
sleep
brown
gave
an
order
propeller
splashed
noisily
and
began
to
move
somehow
it
looked
impossible
but
she
was
moving
they
took
her
slowly
and
cautiously
across
the
lagoon
and
when
the
tide
was
full
put
her
on
the
sand
there
was
much
to
do
yet
and
lister
wondered
whether
he
could
hold
out
until
all
was
done
in
the
evening
montgomery
came
off
on
board
a
boat
pulled
by
four
sturdy
kroos
he
was
very
thin
and
haggard
but
the
fever
had
left
him
when
his
boat
got
near
brown
frowning
savagely
went
to
the
rail
what
want
he
asked
let
me
come
on
board
if
we
ca
agree
i
go
back
in
a
few
minutes
montgomery
replied
and
climbing
the
bulwarks
went
to
the
awning
and
lighted
a
cigarette
you
have
floated
her
but
the
job
not
finished
he
said
i
expect
you
mean
to
bring
off
the
cargo
you
landed
and
you
need
a
fresh
gang
of
native
boys
well
i
can
help
you
imply
you
can
bother
us
if
we
do
agree
brown
remarked
something
like
that
i
can
certainly
make
things
awkward
however
all
i
want
is
to
go
with
you
when
you
open
the
lazaret
where
the
boxes
of
gold
were
stored
ah
said
brown
i
expect
you
see
what
your
wanting
to
go
indicates
looks
as
if
you
knew
something
about
the
wreck
i
imagine
i
do
know
something
montgomery
admitted
quietly
at
the
beginning
i
reckoned
you
would
not
float
her
but
in
order
to
run
no
risk
i
meant
to
hinder
you
as
much
as
possible
now
i
beaten
going
to
be
frank
he
paused
and
resumed
in
a
low
voice
when
i
was
left
control
of
a
respected
business
house
i
was
young
and
ambitious
it
was
plain
the
house
had
weathered
a
bad
storm
but
our
fortunes
were
mending
and
i
thought
they
could
be
built
up
again
well
i
think
i
was
honest
and
when
one
of
crew
demanded
money
i
got
a
jar
since
my
father
loaded
the
ship
i
expect
you
see
where
the
fellow
threats
led
i
see
the
line
cartwright
might
take
brown
remarked
dryly
if
the
boxes
do
hold
gold
he
could
break
you
we
have
found
out
enough
already
to
give
him
a
strong
pull
on
the
boat
last
owners
they
in
his
power
he
wo
use
his
power
cartwright
is
not
that
sort
besides
the
company
is
bankrupt
you
are
not
bankrupt
do
you
know
what
sort
lister
and
i
are
montgomery
smiled
it
not
important
if
there
is
no
gold
in
the
boxes
i
do
want
to
carry
on
the
house
business
you
can
do
what
you
like
he
stopped
for
a
few
moments
and
lister
began
to
feel
some
sympathy
the
man
was
desperate
and
had
obviously
borne
much
my
staying
at
the
factory
was
a
strain
montgomery
continued
i
was
ill
and
when
at
length
i
saw
you
might
succeed
the
suspense
was
horrible
you
see
i
risked
the
honor
of
the
house
my
marriage
my
fortune
all
i
had
and
cared
about
were
you
to
be
married
lister
asked
montgomery
signed
agreement
the
wedding
was
put
off
while
it
looked
as
if
my
mended
fortune
was
built
on
fraud
and
i
had
known
and
agreed
to
the
trick
i
could
not
marry
a
girl
brown
knitted
his
brows
and
was
quiet
for
some
moments
then
he
said
you
are
now
willing
to
get
us
the
boys
we
want
and
help
us
where
you
can
that
is
so
montgomery
agreed
very
well
said
brown
we
expect
to
open
the
lazaret
at
daybreak
and
you
can
come
with
us
you
had
better
send
off
your
boat
and
stop
on
board
chapter
x
barbara
takes
control
the
sun
was
rising
and
the
mist
rolled
back
from
the
lagoon
the
tide
was
low
and
rusty
side
rose
high
above
the
smooth
green
water
damp
weed
hung
from
the
beams
in
her
poop
cabin
and
a
dull
light
came
down
through
the
broken
glass
a
sailor
kneeling
on
the
slimy
planks
tried
to
force
a
corroded
from
its
niche
another
trimmed
a
smoky
lantern
lister
brown
and
montgomery
waited
in
the
their
faces
looked
gray
and
worn
the
sun
had
given
them
a
dull
pallor
and
on
the
west
african
coast
nobody
sleeps
much
after
a
few
minutes
the
sailor
opened
the
swollen
and
then
went
down
brown
carrying
the
lantern
as
a
rule
a
ship
lazaret
is
a
small
dark
used
for
stowing
liquor
and
articles
of
value
was
wet
and
smelt
of
salt
a
row
of
shelves
crossed
the
bulkhead
and
some
water
lay
in
the
angle
where
the
slanted
floor
met
the
side
sheathing
a
thin
jacket
and
an
officer
peaked
cap
were
in
the
water
brown
indicated
the
objects
looks
as
if
somebody
had
stripped
before
he
got
to
work
and
then
left
without
bothering
about
his
clothes
he
said
i
do
know
if
i
expected
this
but
we
examine
the
thing
later
he
lifted
the
lantern
and
the
flickering
beam
touched
five
or
six
small
thick
boxes
well
there
some
of
the
gold
lister
seized
a
box
and
tried
to
lift
it
up
but
stopped
it
feels
like
gold
he
said
and
signed
to
a
sailor
help
me
get
the
stuff
on
deck
watson
they
carried
the
boxes
up
the
ladder
and
brown
brought
the
cap
and
jacket
clothes
he
said
indicating
the
bands
round
the
cuffs
and
cap
the
imitation
had
gone
green
but
clung
to
the
rotten
material
something
in
the
pocket
he
added
and
taking
out
a
small
wet
book
put
it
in
the
sun
we
look
at
this
again
and
now
for
the
first
box
i
may
want
you
to
state
you
saw
me
break
the
seals
sitting
in
the
shade
of
the
poop
they
opened
the
box
which
was
filled
with
fine
grains
then
lister
sent
a
man
to
the
boat
for
some
things
he
had
brought
and
when
the
fellow
came
back
hung
a
small
steel
cup
from
a
the
scale
pretty
accurate
i
use
it
on
board
he
said
well
i
got
the
specific
gravity
of
gold
zinc
and
copper
from
my
and
made
a
few
experiments
with
some
bearing
metals
they
all
brasses
alloys
of
copper
and
zinc
with
a
little
lead
and
tin
in
some
i
weighed
and
measured
two
or
three
small
ingots
and
afterwards
calculated
what
they
weigh
if
their
cubic
size
was
the
capacity
of
the
cup
i
give
you
the
figures
he
did
so
and
then
filled
the
cup
with
the
yellow
grains
and
held
up
the
balance
montgomery
leaning
forward
looked
over
his
shoulder
weighs
more
than
your
heaviest
bearing
metal
it
gold
he
exclaimed
hoarsely
yes
said
lister
it
obviously
gold
perhaps
we
need
open
the
other
boxes
when
we
get
on
board
well
weigh
them
against
this
lot
so
far
as
i
can
reckon
after
heaving
them
up
the
ladder
well
not
find
much
difference
montgomery
sat
down
as
if
he
were
too
limp
to
stand
but
these
are
not
all
the
boxes
that
were
shipped
brown
went
for
the
he
had
put
to
dry
and
took
out
some
papers
this
thing
belonged
to
gordon
herries
second
officer
mr
herries
exclaimed
the
sailor
watson
the
as
was
drowned
when
the
capsized
what
do
you
know
about
it
brown
asked
i
know
something
sir
said
watson
but
montgomery
stopped
him
and
turned
to
the
others
it
seems
the
second
mate
tried
to
the
stuff
looks
like
that
brown
agreed
and
signed
to
the
sailor
now
tell
us
all
you
do
know
we
was
lying
in
forcados
river
shifting
cargo
to
the
lagos
boat
alongside
barret
my
townie
was
on
board
her
he
made
a
run
in
and
told
me
about
the
wreck
when
she
struck
herries
swung
out
number
two
and
barret
was
her
bowman
he
went
to
the
lazaret
with
herries
and
they
got
up
some
bags
of
special
gum
and
some
heavy
boxes
barret
thought
they
were
gold
but
had
seen
them
put
on
board
then
a
big
comber
hit
the
poop
smashed
the
skylights
and
flooded
the
lazaret
they
reckoned
she
was
going
over
and
had
some
bother
to
get
out
well
they
got
the
off
her
side
she
was
pretty
full
with
a
load
of
kroo
boys
and
three
or
four
white
men
in
the
surf
the
steering
oar
broke
she
yawed
across
a
sea
and
turned
out
the
lot
some
held
on
to
her
but
she
rolled
over
and
barret
made
for
the
beach
they
all
landed
but
herries
barret
thought
the
boat
hit
him
gum
and
boxes
went
down
in
the
surf
very
good
said
brown
now
get
off
and
send
somebody
to
help
heave
the
boxes
on
board
montgomery
turned
his
head
and
leaned
against
the
poop
lister
saw
he
trembled
as
if
the
reaction
from
the
strain
was
keen
after
a
few
moments
he
braced
himself
it
done
with
i
think
all
the
boxes
held
gold
but
they
gone
brown
indicated
the
cloud
of
spray
that
tossed
above
the
advancing
lines
of
foam
the
long
rollers
had
crashed
on
the
bar
from
the
beginning
and
would
never
stop
all
the
surf
gets
it
keeps
he
said
if
there
is
a
secret
i
reckon
the
secret
safe
however
we
have
to
talk
about
something
else
you
can
get
us
some
native
boys
i
send
you
a
fresh
gang
if
my
new
agent
arrives
soon
i
go
with
you
as
far
as
sierra
leone
since
you
i
might
perhaps
help
and
i
had
enough
of
the
factory
the
others
agreed
and
soon
afterwards
got
to
work
when
the
negroes
montgomery
sent
arrived
all
the
cargo
worth
salving
was
and
he
bought
the
hulk
for
a
floating
store
then
one
night
when
the
moon
and
tide
were
full
steamed
slowly
across
the
lagoon
two
massive
ropes
trailed
across
her
stern
and
high
dark
bow
towered
above
her
phosphorescent
wake
the
land
breeze
blew
behind
her
and
the
surf
had
not
the
fury
the
sea
breeze
gives
by
day
but
when
plunged
into
the
turmoil
brown
watched
the
tow
ropes
with
anxious
eyes
rolled
and
sheered
about
putting
a
horrible
strain
on
the
hawsers
and
sometimes
for
a
minute
or
two
it
looked
as
if
she
went
astern
flame
blew
from
the
tug
funnel
lighting
the
black
trail
of
smoke
steam
roared
at
her
and
the
engines
throbbed
hard
the
ebb
tide
however
was
beginning
to
run
and
helped
her
across
the
shoals
the
leadsman
got
deeper
water
the
rollers
got
smooth
and
presently
the
swell
was
long
and
regular
and
the
spray
cloud
melted
astern
in
the
morning
a
faint
dark
line
to
starboard
was
all
that
indicated
the
african
coast
next
day
brown
steered
for
the
land
and
called
montgomery
to
the
bridge
i
reckon
to
make
an
anchorage
before
dark
he
said
we
give
the
boys
the
rest
they
need
and
send
to
leone
for
coal
learmont
will
land
you
then
you
not
going
to
take
into
port
montgomery
remarked
with
some
surprise
i
am
not
cartwright
expects
me
to
save
him
as
much
as
possible
and
there
are
british
officers
and
board
of
trade
rules
at
leone
you
do
imagine
they
let
me
start
for
las
palmas
surveys
reports
repairs
and
sending
for
another
tug
might
cost
two
or
three
thousand
pounds
then
half
my
crew
are
sick
and
some
are
helpless
though
i
reckon
they
pick
up
sooner
at
sea
than
in
an
african
hospital
it
a
big
risk
after
all
i
owe
you
much
and
know
something
about
curing
malarial
fever
besides
i
a
yachtsman
and
can
steer
and
use
the
lead
if
you
take
me
i
go
all
the
way
however
you
ought
to
send
lister
off
he
ca
hold
out
he
claims
he
can
brown
said
dryly
we
have
argued
about
his
going
to
grand
canary
by
a
but
he
obstinate
means
to
finish
the
job
that
his
sort
anyhow
it
possible
the
trade
breeze
will
brace
him
up
and
if
he
did
go
the
chances
of
my
taking
to
liverpool
are
not
good
montgomery
stayed
on
board
and
when
the
tug
returned
with
coal
they
hove
anchor
and
began
the
long
run
to
las
palmas
for
a
time
lister
kept
the
engines
going
and
superintended
the
pump
on
board
the
wreck
but
he
could
not
sleep
and
in
the
morning
it
was
hard
to
drag
himself
from
his
bunk
and
start
another
laborious
day
the
strain
was
horrible
and
he
was
weakening
fast
but
it
would
be
cooler
soon
and
perhaps
he
might
hold
out
until
they
met
the
invigorating
northeast
breeze
in
the
meantime
cartwright
went
back
to
liverpool
cartwright
got
better
and
barbara
waited
for
news
she
had
refused
lister
but
to
refuse
had
cost
her
more
than
she
had
thought
after
a
time
cartwright
wrote
and
stated
that
the
tug
and
arcturus
had
started
home
no
fresh
news
arrived
and
barbara
tried
to
hide
her
suspense
until
one
morning
a
small
african
liner
steamed
into
port
some
passengers
landed
and
when
they
lunched
at
the
hotel
one
talked
about
his
going
off
with
the
first
officer
to
a
ship
that
signaled
for
help
it
was
a
moving
picture
he
said
the
rusty
steamer
rolling
on
the
blue
combers
and
the
little
battered
tug
holding
her
the
breeze
was
strong
and
for
some
days
they
had
not
made
three
knots
an
hour
well
i
know
something
about
fever
but
they
were
sick
the
engineer
delirious
and
very
weak
barbara
sitting
near
the
passenger
made
an
effort
for
calm
her
heart
beat
and
her
breath
came
fast
nobody
remarked
her
abrupt
movement
and
the
other
went
on
coal
food
and
fresh
water
were
running
out
their
medicine
chest
was
empty
everything
was
foul
with
soot
and
salt
i
expect
it
was
long
since
they
were
able
to
clean
decks
the
skipper
was
in
a
hammock
under
the
and
could
not
get
up
an
african
trader
montgomery
of
a
liverpool
house
seemed
to
have
control
his
skin
was
yellow
like
a
mulatto
a
young
american
doctor
to
whom
barbara
had
been
talking
looked
up
jaundice
after
malaria
he
remarked
i
do
know
west
africa
but
i
was
at
panama
was
malaria
all
the
rest
had
got
it
was
not
the
passenger
replied
meaningly
however
if
you
know
panama
did
you
try
to
tow
the
ship
barbara
interrupted
the
mate
thought
it
impossible
she
was
big
and
foul
with
weed
our
boat
is
small
and
we
could
not
delay
much
because
of
the
mails
we
sent
a
across
with
water
and
food
and
then
steamed
on
barbara
looked
about
the
table
cartwright
was
at
the
other
end
and
barbara
thought
she
had
not
heard
she
touched
the
young
doctor
will
you
help
me
on
board
the
african
steamer
i
must
see
the
captain
why
certainly
we
look
for
a
boat
the
other
replied
and
they
went
off
barbara
saw
the
captain
and
when
she
stated
that
the
owner
of
was
her
he
sent
for
the
chief
mate
who
narrated
his
visit
to
the
wreck
you
took
the
ship
doctor
said
barbara
is
he
now
on
board
the
mate
said
he
imagined
the
doctor
had
not
landed
and
barbara
turned
to
wheeler
go
and
find
him
find
out
all
you
can
for
some
time
afterwards
she
talked
to
the
ship
officers
and
when
wheeler
returned
went
back
to
her
boat
while
the
rowed
them
to
the
mole
she
asked
wheeler
for
his
and
wrote
an
address
don
luis
sarmiento
is
the
best
doctor
in
the
town
and
had
something
to
do
with
a
fever
hospital
in
cuba
she
said
if
you
tell
him
i
sent
you
he
will
help
take
all
the
medicine
he
can
give
you
and
then
go
to
leopard
trading
company
and
buy
whatever
you
think
sick
men
would
need
bring
me
the
bills
if
i
get
all
that
would
be
useful
it
will
cost
you
high
said
wheeler
and
helped
her
up
the
steps
at
the
mole
that
is
not
important
get
the
things
very
well
but
the
ship
is
six
hundred
miles
off
how
are
you
going
to
put
the
truck
on
board
i
going
to
see
about
that
next
barbara
replied
and
indicated
a
cloud
of
dust
rolling
along
the
road
there
the
steam
tram
talk
hustle
wheeler
lifted
his
cap
and
running
along
the
mole
jumped
on
board
the
tram
when
he
had
gone
barbara
went
to
the
office
of
an
important
english
merchant
house
and
asked
for
the
junior
partner
she
was
strangely
calm
although
she
knew
that
when
the
strain
was
over
she
would
pay
in
the
meantime
she
needed
help
and
admitted
it
was
lucky
young
men
liked
her
she
had
not
hesitated
to
use
her
charm
on
the
american
the
junior
partner
was
keen
to
help
and
going
with
her
to
a
coaling
office
offered
to
charter
a
powerful
spanish
tug
the
company
had
recently
bought
the
manager
agreed
and
barbara
made
a
calculation
if
you
can
get
the
boat
ready
to
sail
in
the
morning
i
send
you
a
check
when
she
starts
she
said
they
went
out
and
the
merchant
gave
barbara
an
approving
smile
i
imagine
they
have
at
the
moment
much
use
for
the
tug
which
accounts
for
their
being
willing
to
take
a
moderate
sum
all
the
same
you
handled
the
situation
like
a
good
business
man
had
they
known
much
about
your
plans
before
we
agreed
they
would
have
sent
the
tug
and
claimed
a
large
reward
for
salvage
in
fact
it
looks
as
if
you
had
saved
cartwright
it
possible
barbara
broke
in
impatiently
still
they
do
know
where
is
and
that
her
crew
are
now
however
we
must
engage
fresh
men
to
relieve
the
others
i
do
mind
if
you
pay
them
something
over
the
usual
rate
the
merchant
engaged
the
crew
of
a
spanish
fishing
schooner
that
was
being
laid
up
and
barbara
returning
to
the
hotel
found
wheeler
in
the
garden
i
got
all
the
medicine
and
truck
i
reckon
would
be
useful
he
said
if
the
steamboat
man
did
exaggerate
you
want
a
doctor
next
barbara
gave
him
a
level
glance
and
smiled
if
you
like
you
may
go
a
fast
tug
sails
in
the
morning
why
he
said
i
be
delighted
you
can
call
it
fixed
i
came
along
for
a
holiday
but
soon
found
that
loafing
made
me
tired
thank
you
said
barbara
and
was
gone
the
doctor
laughed
and
joining
an
english
friend
in
the
hotel
ordered
a
drink
i
reckon
i
been
rushed
he
remarked
you
folks
look
slow
but
i
allow
when
you
do
get
started
some
of
you
can
move
since
lunch
been
helping
an
english
girl
fix
some
things
and
she
hit
a
pace
that
left
me
out
of
breath
miss
hyslop
said
the
other
perhaps
if
she
had
a
job
for
me
i
might
have
used
an
effort
to
get
up
speed
a
charming
girl
and
i
think
she
resolute
she
surely
resolute
wheeler
agreed
miss
hyslop
sees
where
she
wants
to
go
and
gets
there
by
the
shortest
road
when
dusk
fell
barbara
thought
all
was
ready
and
sitting
down
by
cartwright
narrated
what
she
had
done
after
she
stopped
cartwright
put
her
hand
gently
on
the
girl
arm
it
lucky
you
came
out
with
me
she
said
i
would
not
have
known
what
to
do
and
i
doubt
if
mortimer
barbara
laughed
mortimer
would
have
calculated
weighed
one
thing
against
another
and
studied
his
plans
for
a
week
mine
are
rude
but
in
the
morning
they
begin
to
work
after
all
in
a
sense
i
have
not
done
much
i
have
sent
others
when
i
want
to
go
myself
it
impossible
my
dear
said
cartwright
firmly
well
i
expect
i
must
be
resigned
one
is
forced
to
pay
for
breaking
rules
i
have
paid
but
we
talk
about
something
else
the
tug
and
supplies
have
no
doubt
cost
much
cartwright
remarked
you
must
let
me
give
you
a
check
no
said
barbara
in
a
resolute
voice
i
will
take
no
money
until
mine
all
gone
father
a
dear
i
owe
him
much
and
now
i
can
help
going
to
help
i
have
sent
a
cablegram
he
had
better
come
out
but
in
the
meantime
he
need
be
anxious
because
i
have
taken
control
cartwright
let
her
go
presently
and
barbara
went
to
her
room
she
had
borne
a
heavy
strain
but
the
reaction
had
begun
and
throwing
herself
on
a
couch
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
cried
chapter
xi
lister
reward
signal
flags
fluttered
in
the
breeze
at
the
top
of
the
isleta
and
a
smoke
cloud
stained
the
blue
horizon
for
a
few
minutes
the
cloud
vanished
and
then
rolled
up
again
thicker
than
before
cartwright
studied
it
carefully
and
gave
the
glasses
to
barbara
who
stood
near
him
on
the
catalina
mole
is
that
trail
of
smoke
he
asked
i
think
i
see
two
sometimes
they
melt
but
they
getting
distinct
now
there
two
ah
said
cartwright
then
it
i
expect
your
tug
has
saved
the
situation
lister
saved
before
i
meddled
barbara
declared
with
a
blush
however
i
glad
i
could
help
you
have
often
helped
me
cartwright
eyes
twinkled
all
i
gave
i
have
got
back
but
i
not
persuaded
you
did
mean
to
help
another
well
perhaps
the
other
deserves
your
interest
brown
a
useful
man
but
he
has
some
drawbacks
and
i
doubt
if
he
could
have
carried
through
the
undertaking
if
you
wait
in
the
shade
i
get
a
jacket
barbara
replied
there
a
fresh
breeze
the
launch
splashes
and
i
going
with
you
to
meet
when
the
first
flag
blew
out
from
the
isleta
staff
she
had
called
cartwright
and
they
had
hurried
to
the
neighboring
mole
cartwright
had
arrived
two
days
before
and
they
had
watched
the
signals
until
the
longed
for
message
came
in
tow
from
the
i
think
you
wait
said
cartwright
quietly
you
do
know
much
about
fever
and
the
men
i
sent
are
not
altogether
making
a
triumphant
return
the
blood
came
to
barbara
skin
she
had
meant
to
go
and
hated
to
be
baffled
but
cartwright
gave
her
a
steady
glance
and
she
knew
there
was
no
use
in
arguing
when
he
looked
like
that
did
you
or
your
mother
tell
me
seaton
arrived
by
a
recent
boat
he
resumed
barbara
was
surprised
but
said
seaton
was
at
the
metropole
cartwright
looked
at
the
tugs
smoke
then
i
ought
to
have
time
to
see
her
before
they
tow
in
some
sea
is
running
and
they
ca
steam
fast
he
started
for
the
catalina
and
when
he
stopped
by
chair
his
face
was
hot
and
he
trembled
hurry
and
muscular
effort
upset
him
but
time
was
valuable
i
have
not
yet
asked
you
for
money
clara
he
said
that
is
so
cartwright
agreed
sometimes
i
was
hurt
because
you
did
not
you
ought
to
know
all
that
mine
is
yours
cartwright
smiled
you
are
a
good
sort
and
i
going
to
borrow
now
because
i
can
pay
back
i
want
you
to
telegraph
your
bank
to
meet
my
check
i
write
you
a
check
no
said
cartwright
i
think
the
other
plan
is
better
well
the
sum
is
rather
large
he
stated
the
sum
and
cartwright
said
i
not
very
curious
but
why
do
you
want
the
money
i
going
to
buy
seaton
shares
ah
said
cartwright
with
a
disturbed
look
she
tried
to
force
you
to
buy
before
cartwright
knew
his
placid
wife
hated
seaton
you
puzzled
he
remarked
well
i
have
bought
the
shares
long
since
but
i
was
rich
enough
and
did
think
my
borrowing
was
justified
all
the
same
the
block
she
holds
gives
her
a
dangerous
power
and
if
i
can
get
them
i
baffle
the
opposition
at
the
meeting
but
i
must
be
quick
if
you
want
to
baffle
ellen
seaton
you
can
use
all
the
money
i
have
got
cartwright
declared
tell
me
what
i
must
telegraph
the
bank
cartwright
did
so
and
made
for
the
metropole
as
fast
as
possible
because
the
tugs
smoke
was
not
far
off
when
he
reached
the
big
square
hotel
he
gave
a
page
his
card
and
frowned
while
he
waited
in
the
patio
time
was
valuable
and
he
hoped
seaton
would
not
be
long
on
the
whole
he
did
not
think
he
was
going
to
be
shabby
but
perhaps
shabbiness
was
justified
ellen
had
not
forgotten
she
had
thought
him
her
lover
and
although
it
was
long
since
she
would
not
forget
she
hated
his
wife
and
had
tried
to
injure
him
cartwright
imagined
she
would
try
again
and
so
long
as
she
kept
her
shares
her
antagonism
was
dangerous
she
entered
the
patio
with
two
young
tourists
whom
she
sent
off
and
beckoned
cartwright
to
a
bench
behind
a
palm
the
sun
that
pierced
the
glass
roof
was
strong
and
he
reflected
with
dry
amusement
that
ellen
looked
better
by
electric
light
in
the
evening
although
she
smiled
her
glance
was
keen
and
not
friendly
i
arrived
some
days
since
and
met
barbara
in
the
street
but
she
has
not
been
to
see
me
yet
she
said
however
now
you
have
come
i
ought
to
be
satisfied
since
you
were
able
to
get
away
from
the
office
i
expect
shipping
is
languid
cartwright
thought
she
meant
to
be
nasty
for
one
thing
barbara
had
not
gone
to
see
her
and
perhaps
had
not
urged
her
calling
at
the
hotel
ellen
did
not
like
the
girl
but
she
wanted
to
know
people
and
cartwright
had
stopped
at
las
palmas
for
some
time
as
a
rule
friends
were
good
this
however
was
not
important
he
must
buy
shares
before
arrived
and
the
news
of
her
salvage
got
about
oh
well
he
said
although
i
think
i
see
signs
of
improvement
things
are
not
very
promising
yet
if
you
are
not
hopeful
the
outlook
must
be
black
seaton
remarked
meaningly
perhaps
i
ought
to
sympathize
but
the
effort
too
much
my
investments
have
all
gone
wrong
and
my
luck
at
the
grand
national
was
remarkably
bad
in
fact
if
nobody
will
buy
my
shares
in
your
line
i
may
be
forced
to
agree
with
the
people
who
want
to
wind
up
the
company
cartwright
thought
his
luck
was
good
ellen
was
extravagant
and
a
gambler
no
doubt
she
needed
money
but
he
knew
she
was
willing
to
hurt
him
and
could
do
so
all
the
same
if
she
could
force
him
to
buy
the
shares
she
thought
worth
nothing
her
greed
would
conquer
her
spitefulness
well
he
was
going
to
indulge
her
if
you
did
join
my
antagonists
i
might
pull
through
but
i
admit
it
would
be
awkward
he
replied
in
order
to
avoid
the
fight
i
buy
your
shares
for
ten
shillings
seaton
hesitated
she
did
not
want
to
lose
her
power
but
she
wanted
money
nominally
the
shares
were
worth
a
much
larger
sum
but
she
had
found
out
that
nobody
else
was
willing
to
buy
the
block
for
all
that
cartwright
was
cunning
and
she
wondered
whether
he
knew
something
she
did
not
she
asked
for
a
higher
price
but
cartwright
refused
he
was
cool
and
humorous
although
he
knew
was
steadily
nearing
the
harbor
perhaps
in
a
few
minutes
the
on
the
isleta
would
read
her
flags
at
length
he
pulled
out
his
watch
i
have
an
engagement
but
i
rather
want
the
shares
my
getting
them
would
help
me
at
the
meeting
he
said
shall
we
say
this
is
the
limit
very
well
said
seaton
and
smiled
with
a
sense
of
triumph
it
looks
very
greedy
but
when
can
i
have
a
check
you
see
i
nearly
bankrupt
now
said
cartwright
and
taking
out
his
fountain
pen
rang
a
bell
send
a
page
for
some
notepaper
and
write
an
undertaking
to
deliver
me
the
shares
seaton
did
so
and
cartwright
wrote
the
check
then
she
signed
to
one
of
the
young
men
she
had
sent
off
since
you
are
very
you
had
better
have
a
witness
i
relieved
to
get
the
check
particularly
since
i
expected
you
would
be
forced
to
ask
clara
for
the
money
cartwright
had
to
smile
the
sneer
was
ellen
parthian
shot
she
was
retiring
from
the
field
but
he
owned
that
she
might
have
beaten
him
by
a
bold
attack
and
he
had
been
afraid
he
went
to
the
bar
and
ordered
a
drink
and
then
going
out
saw
fresh
signals
blow
from
the
isleta
staff
hull
was
visible
in
the
tugs
thick
smoke
the
on
the
hill
with
his
big
telescope
had
read
her
flags
and
was
signaling
her
name
and
number
to
the
town
cartwright
had
won
by
a
few
minutes
and
was
satisfied
although
he
had
given
seaton
for
her
shares
when
perhaps
he
need
not
this
was
now
about
their
just
value
and
for
old
time
sake
he
had
not
meant
to
cheat
her
in
the
meantime
a
launch
was
waiting
to
take
him
on
board
and
he
hurried
to
the
mole
barbara
saw
the
launch
start
with
mixed
emotions
she
was
something
of
a
rebel
and
had
anybody
but
cartwright
ordered
her
to
stop
she
would
not
have
obeyed
she
waited
in
the
shade
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
laboring
tugs
sometimes
she
felt
a
thrill
of
triumph
because
lister
had
conquered
sometimes
she
was
tortured
by
suspense
she
did
not
know
if
he
stood
at
the
levers
in
the
or
lay
unconscious
in
his
bunk
well
she
would
soon
know
and
she
shrank
she
rubbed
the
glasses
and
looked
again
there
were
two
towropes
plunged
across
the
rollers
on
starboard
bow
the
spanish
tug
to
port
it
looked
as
if
the
wreck
did
not
work
spray
blew
about
the
boats
and
the
crested
seas
broke
in
foaming
turmoil
against
the
towed
vessel
side
until
she
drew
in
behind
the
isleta
a
few
minutes
afterwards
she
swung
round
the
mole
and
barbara
thought
the
picture
moving
the
tugs
looked
very
small
the
hull
they
towed
to
an
anchorage
floated
high
above
her
proper
rolling
on
the
languid
swell
at
the
harbor
mouth
she
looked
huge
her
rusty
side
was
like
a
warehouse
wall
when
she
lifted
her
plates
from
the
water
one
saw
the
wet
weed
shine
higher
up
it
clung
parched
and
dry
to
the
red
iron
although
there
were
clean
belts
where
the
stuff
was
scraped
away
barbara
pictured
the
exhausted
men
scraping
feebly
when
the
sea
was
calm
and
the
sun
did
not
touch
the
vessel
side
all
the
same
the
men
had
won
a
triumph
it
looked
impossible
that
the
handful
of
bemused
ruffians
she
had
seen
start
at
liverpool
could
have
dragged
the
big
vessel
from
the
bottom
of
the
lagoon
but
the
thing
was
done
battered
and
rusty
with
sagging
masts
and
broken
funnel
was
coming
into
harbor
a
big
pump
throbbed
on
board
throwing
water
down
her
side
she
flew
a
small
bright
red
ensign
aft
and
a
new
at
the
masthead
barbara
thought
the
flag
flaunted
proudly
and
the
thing
was
significant
cartwright
had
weathered
the
storm
but
she
had
helped
the
tugs
engines
stopped
and
barbara
heart
beat
for
a
yellow
flag
went
up
she
hated
the
ominous
signal
and
turning
the
glasses
followed
the
doctor
launch
the
boat
ran
alongside
a
man
went
on
board
returned
and
climbed
a
ladder
to
deck
he
did
not
come
back
for
some
time
and
barbara
looked
for
lister
but
could
not
see
him
then
the
yellow
flag
was
hauled
down
and
moved
slowly
up
the
harbor
a
fleet
of
followed
and
when
the
anchor
dropped
crowded
about
the
ship
barbara
braced
herself
and
waited
half
the
voyage
was
over
and
when
the
engines
were
cleaned
and
mended
would
steam
to
england
the
salvors
had
won
but
sometimes
victory
cost
much
and
barbara
knew
she
might
have
to
pay
a
launch
with
an
awning
steamed
to
the
mole
and
vanished
behind
the
wall
barbara
stopped
in
the
shade
somehow
she
durst
not
go
to
the
steps
cartwright
came
up
but
seeing
his
grave
look
she
let
him
pass
then
the
american
doctor
reached
the
top
and
called
to
somebody
below
three
or
four
men
awkwardly
lifted
a
stretcher
to
the
pavement
and
cartwright
signed
to
the
driver
of
a
carriage
waiting
in
the
road
wheeler
stopped
him
it
not
far
carrying
will
be
smoother
very
well
i
see
all
ready
said
cartwright
and
got
into
the
carriage
then
barbara
went
to
the
stretcher
which
was
covered
by
green
canvas
she
thought
she
knew
who
lay
behind
the
screens
and
her
look
was
strained
is
lister
very
ill
she
asked
wheeler
gave
her
a
sympathetic
glance
he
is
pretty
sick
he
was
nearly
all
in
when
i
boarded
the
ship
now
it
possible
he
get
better
barbara
turned
her
head
but
after
a
few
moments
looked
up
thank
you
for
going
where
are
the
others
we
have
sent
some
to
the
spanish
hospital
landed
them
at
the
coaling
wharf
they
not
very
sick
the
rest
are
on
board
the
rest
three
short
said
the
doctor
quietly
they
have
made
their
last
voyage
but
the
boys
are
waiting
to
get
off
with
the
stretcher
barbara
let
him
go
and
followed
he
looked
very
tired
and
she
did
not
want
to
talk
she
saw
the
stretcher
carried
up
the
hotel
steps
and
along
a
passage
and
then
went
to
her
room
a
spanish
doctor
and
nurse
were
waiting
and
she
knew
she
would
be
sent
away
to
feel
she
could
not
help
was
hard
but
she
tried
to
be
resigned
and
stopped
in
the
quiet
room
listening
for
steps
somebody
might
bring
a
message
that
lister
wanted
her
the
message
did
not
come
and
she
was
conscious
of
some
relief
although
she
was
tormented
by
regretful
thoughts
lister
loved
her
and
she
had
refused
him
because
she
was
proud
perhaps
her
refusal
was
justified
but
she
was
honest
and
admitted
that
she
had
known
he
would
not
let
her
go
and
had
afterwards
wondered
how
she
would
reply
when
he
asked
her
again
now
she
knew
the
strain
had
broken
her
resolution
she
had
indulged
her
ridiculous
pride
and
saw
it
might
cost
her
much
her
lover
was
very
ill
wheeler
doubted
if
he
would
get
better
in
the
evening
montgomery
joined
cartwright
in
a
corner
of
the
i
expect
captain
brown
told
you
about
the
bother
i
gave
him
he
remarked
that
is
so
said
cartwright
he
however
stated
you
gave
him
some
help
all
the
same
at
the
beginning
i
held
up
the
job
when
brown
could
not
work
your
expenses
ran
on
and
i
feel
i
ought
to
pay
it
just
coming
home
when
my
men
were
sick
and
brown
was
in
his
bunk
you
undertook
the
duties
of
doctor
and
navigator
and
wheeler
admits
your
cures
were
good
since
you
have
a
suppose
we
say
we
quits
montgomery
felt
some
relief
it
looked
as
if
cartwright
did
not
mean
to
use
his
advantage
the
old
fellow
was
generous
montgomery
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
resumed
i
understand
you
bought
the
wreck
i
used
the
shareholders
money
at
all
events
i
used
as
much
as
i
durst
she
the
company
ship
but
the
cargo
the
cargo
mine
that
is
i
get
an
allowance
agreed
upon
with
the
underwriters
for
all
i
have
salved
i
rather
think
the
sum
will
be
large
then
you
satisfied
although
you
did
get
all
the
gold
and
lost
the
valuable
gum
in
the
lazaret
cartwright
eyes
twinkled
i
some
grounds
for
satisfaction
and
i
know
when
to
stop
but
perhaps
i
better
be
as
frank
as
is
needful
very
well
i
get
salvage
on
some
of
the
gold
the
rest
is
under
the
surf
and
nobody
will
open
the
boxes
now
the
thing
done
with
montgomery
was
moved
but
he
saw
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
and
asked
quietly
will
you
tell
me
what
you
think
about
the
prospects
of
the
line
on
the
whole
i
imagine
the
prospects
are
good
we
have
got
a
useful
boat
for
a
very
small
sum
and
the
last
report
was
could
probably
be
floated
without
much
damage
when
the
lawrence
ice
breaks
well
i
calculate
next
year
trading
will
earn
us
a
small
dividend
and
since
business
is
improving
we
ought
to
prosper
before
very
long
thank
you
said
montgomery
i
know
something
about
the
line
and
imagine
the
directors
may
need
support
just
now
i
have
some
money
that
does
not
earn
much
would
it
help
if
i
bought
a
number
of
your
shares
i
think
not
said
cartwright
the
plan
has
drawbacks
people
are
sometimes
uncharitable
and
i
have
antagonists
who
might
hint
at
a
bribe
besides
i
do
need
support
my
luck
has
turned
and
i
rather
think
i
can
break
the
opposition
he
smiled
and
getting
up
put
his
hand
on
montgomery
arm
all
the
same
when
i
send
a
boat
to
africa
you
can
load
her
up
now
i
going
to
find
the
nurse
and
ask
about
lister
lister
was
delirious
and
for
two
or
three
days
the
doctors
doubted
his
recovery
then
one
morning
they
said
his
temperature
had
fallen
and
there
was
hope
next
morning
they
admitted
that
he
was
slowly
making
progress
barbara
did
not
leave
the
hotel
lest
she
miss
the
latest
news
from
the
she
was
not
allowed
to
go
in
and
when
evening
came
she
knew
she
could
not
sleep
she
had
not
slept
much
since
they
carried
lister
up
the
steps
when
all
was
quiet
and
the
guests
had
gone
to
bed
she
went
to
the
veranda
and
leaned
against
the
rails
she
was
highly
strung
and
rebellious
lister
had
sent
her
a
message
but
she
was
not
allowed
to
see
him
yet
she
wanted
to
see
him
and
was
persuaded
that
for
him
to
see
her
would
not
hurt
she
knew
he
wanted
her
the
moon
was
bright
but
the
shadow
of
the
hotel
stretched
across
the
garden
somebody
was
moving
about
in
the
gloom
and
barbara
started
when
she
saw
it
was
the
nurse
the
tired
woman
had
gone
out
to
rest
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
cool
night
air
and
barbara
saw
her
opportunity
stealing
across
the
veranda
she
went
along
a
passage
and
up
some
stairs
the
landing
at
the
top
was
dark
but
she
knew
lister
door
and
turning
the
handle
quietly
looked
in
bright
moonlight
shone
through
the
open
window
and
a
curtain
moved
in
the
gentle
breeze
mosquito
gauze
wavered
about
the
bed
where
a
quiet
figure
lay
barbara
stole
across
the
floor
and
pulled
back
the
guard
the
rings
rattled
and
lister
opened
his
eyes
he
smiled
and
barbara
kneeling
by
the
bed
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
my
dear
you
know
me
of
course
i
wanted
you
since
i
got
my
senses
back
i
tried
to
call
you
you
called
not
long
since
i
cheated
the
nurse
and
came
but
if
you
ought
to
be
quiet
i
must
talk
the
doctors
said
they
do
understand
said
lister
now
i
have
seen
you
i
going
to
get
well
barbara
lifted
her
head
and
studied
him
his
face
was
pinched
his
skin
was
very
white
and
wet
her
eyes
filled
and
she
was
moved
by
tender
pity
oh
my
dear
she
said
it
was
for
my
sake
you
went
lister
took
her
hand
and
she
felt
his
was
thin
and
hot
i
paid
for
all
but
barbara
i
think
you
when
i
better
she
kissed
him
of
course
i
marry
you
when
you
like
in
the
meantime
you
weak
and
tired
and
must
go
to
sleep
i
am
tired
he
admitted
besides
the
nurse
will
come
barbara
gently
touched
his
wet
hair
and
moved
his
pillow
the
nurse
is
not
important
but
you
must
talk
she
gave
him
her
hand
again
and
he
went
to
sleep
some
time
afterwards
the
nurse
returned
and
started
when
she
saw
the
white
figure
kneeling
by
the
bed
then
she
began
to
talk
angrily
in
a
low
voice
barbara
was
getting
cramped
but
without
moving
her
body
she
looked
at
the
nurse
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
rebellious
fire
be
quiet
he
must
wake
she
said
there
no
use
in
arguing
i
mean
to
stay
