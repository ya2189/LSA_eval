arrival
of

at
sacramento
the
young
vigilantes
i
a
narrow
escape
from
the
as
passenger
train
number
four
was
rounding
a
curve
at
full
speed
ten
miles
out
of
this
city
on
the
morning
of
october
and
at
a
point
where
a
deep
cut
shut
out
the
view
ahead
the
engineer
saw
some
one
man
or
boy
he
could
not
well
make
out
which
running
down
the
track
toward
the
train
frantically
swinging
both
arms
and
waving
his
cap
in
the
air
as
if
to
attract
attention
the
instantly
shut
off
steam
whistled
for
brakes
and
quickly
brought
the
train
to
a
standstill
the
put
his
head
out
of
the
cab
window
the
conductor
jumped
off
followed
by
fifty
frightened
passengers
all
talking
and
gesticulating
at
once
while
the
person
who
had
just
given
the
warning
signal
slackened
his
breakneck
pace
somewhat
upon
seeing
that
he
had
succeeded
in
stopping
the
train
the
matter
shouted
the
impatient
when
this
person
had
come
within
hearing
do
you
stop
us
for
called
out
the
little
conductor
sharply
in
his
turn
at
the
same
time
anxiously
consulting
the
face
of
the
watch
he
held
in
his
hand
to
both
questions
the
young
man
seemed
too
much
out
of
breath
to
reply
offhand
but
turning
and
pointing
in
the
direction
whence
he
came
he
shook
his
head
warningly
threw
himself
down
on
the
roadbed
as
limp
as
a
rag
and
began
fanning
himself
with
his
cap
after
getting
his
breath
a
little
he
made
out
to
say
afire
quarter
mile
back
tried
put
it
out
could
heard
train
coming
afraid
be
too
late
could
run
another
step
aboard
said
the
conductor
to
him
to
the
grinning
run
down
and
take
a
look
at
it
get
out
your
flag
to
a
brakeman
as
not
thirteen
be
along
before
we
can
make
brenton
switch
all
aboard
the
delayed
train
then
moved
on
as
it
neared
the
burning
bridge
it
was
clear
to
every
one
that
the
young
man
warning
had
prevented
a
disastrous
wreck
probably
much
loss
of
life
because
the
bridge
could
not
be
seen
until
the
train
was
close
upon
it
all
hands
immediately
set
to
work
with
pails
extinguishing
the
flames
which
was
finally
done
after
a
hard
fight
to
risk
a
heavy
train
upon
the
stringers
was
however
out
of
the
question
leaving
a
man
to
see
that
the
fire
did
not
break
out
again
the
train
was
run
back
to
the
next
station
there
to
await
further
orders
we
were
unable
to
learn
the
name
of
the
young
man
to
whose
presence
of
mind
the
passengers
on
number
four
owed
their
escape
from
a
serious
perhaps
fatal
disaster
but
we
are
informed
that
a
collection
was
taken
up
for
him
on
the
train
which
he
however
refused
to
accept
stoutly
insisting
that
he
had
only
done
what
it
was
his
duty
to
do
under
the
circumstances
thus
far
the
we
now
take
up
the
narrative
where
the
enterprising
journal
left
off
while
the
delayed
train
was
being
held
for
orders
the
young
man
whose
ready
wit
had
averted
a
calamity
stood
on
the
platform
with
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
apparently
an
unconcerned
spectator
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
the
little
conductor
stepped
up
to
him
i
say
young
feller
what
may
i
call
your
name
seabury
zebra
zebra
repeated
the
conductor
in
a
puzzled
tone
then
i
your
ancestors
came
over
in
the
ark
i
did
say
zebra
i
said
seabury
plain
enough
snapped
back
the
young
man
getting
red
in
the
face
at
seeing
the
broad
grins
on
the
faces
around
him
do
fire
up
so
got
any
first
name
walter
walter
seabury
the
conductor
repeated
slowly
while
scratching
it
down
got
to
report
this
job
you
know
say
where
you
goin
i
walkin
to
boston
shanks
mare
hey
no
you
ai
get
aboard
and
save
your
muscle
you
own
this
train
and
everything
in
it
lively
now
the
conductor
then
waved
his
hand
and
the
train
started
on
at
the
bridge
a
transfer
was
effected
to
a
second
train
and
this
one
again
was
soon
reeling
off
the
miles
toward
boston
as
if
to
make
up
for
lost
time
being
left
to
himself
young
seabury
whom
we
may
as
well
hereafter
call
by
his
christian
name
of
walter
could
think
of
nothing
else
than
his
wonderful
luck
instead
of
having
a
long
weary
tramp
before
him
here
he
was
riding
in
a
railroad
train
and
without
its
costing
him
a
cent
this
was
a
saving
of
both
time
and
money
pretty
soon
the
friendly
conductor
came
down
the
aisle
to
where
walter
sat
looking
out
of
the
car
window
after
giving
him
a
sharp
look
the
conductor
made
up
his
mind
that
here
was
no
vagabond
tramp
it
none
of
my
business
but
all
the
same
i
like
to
know
what
you
to
boston
for
young
feller
he
asked
going
to
look
for
work
what
your
job
i
a
rigger
and
his
hands
tarry
and
cracked
bore
out
his
story
perfectly
ever
in
boston
never
know
anybody
there
nobody
got
any
of
this
you
know
slapping
his
pocket
at
this
question
walter
flushed
up
he
drew
himself
up
stiffly
smiled
a
pitying
smile
and
said
nothing
his
manner
conveyed
the
idea
that
he
really
did
know
exactly
how
much
he
was
worth
that
the
conductor
went
on
now
look
here
get
lost
in
boston
i
tell
you
what
when
we
get
in
i
show
you
how
to
go
to
get
down
among
the
riggers
lofts
you
a
rigger
you
say
walter
nodded
they
all
in
a
bunch
down
at
the
north
end
riggers
sailmakers
and
and
all
the
rest
full
of
work
too
i
guess
all
on
account
of
this
californy
business
everybody
goin
crazy
over
it
you
will
be
too
in
a
week
by
this
time
the
train
was
rumbling
over
the
long
waste
of
stretching
out
between
the
mainland
and
the
city
and
in
five
minutes
more
it
drew
up
with
a
jerk
in
the
station
with
the
locomotive
puffing
out
steam
like
a
tired
racehorse
after
a
hard
push
at
the
finish
the
conductor
was
as
good
as
his
word
he
told
walter
to
go
straight
up
tremont
street
until
he
came
to
hanover
then
straight
down
hanover
to
the
water
and
then
to
follow
his
nose
oh
you
ca
miss
it
was
the
cheerful
parting
assurance
smell
it
a
mile
but
going
straight
up
this
street
and
straight
down
that
was
a
direction
not
so
easy
to
follow
as
walter
soon
found
the
crowds
bewildered
him
and
in
trying
to
get
out
of
everybody
way
he
got
in
way
and
was
jostled
shoved
about
and
stared
at
as
he
slowly
made
his
way
through
the
throng
until
his
roving
eyes
caught
sight
of
the
tall
masts
and
fluttering
pennants
where
the
long
street
suddenly
came
to
an
end
walter
put
down
his
bundle
took
off
his
cap
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
whichever
way
he
looked
the
wharves
were
crowded
with
ships
the
ships
with
workmen
and
the
street
with
loaded
trucks
and
wagons
casting
an
eye
upward
he
could
see
riggers
at
work
among
the
maze
of
ropes
and
spars
like
so
many
spiders
weaving
their
webs
here
at
least
he
could
feel
at
home
ii
walter
tells
his
story
walter
first
want
was
to
find
a
boarding
house
suited
to
his
means
turning
into
a
side
street
walled
in
by
a
row
of
brick
houses
all
as
like
as
peas
in
a
pod
he
found
that
the
difficulty
would
be
to
pick
and
choose
as
all
showed
the
same
little
tin
sign
announcing
board
and
lodging
by
the
day
or
week
tacked
upon
the
door
after
walking
irresolutely
up
and
down
the
street
two
or
three
times
he
finally
mustered
up
courage
to
give
a
timid
pull
at
the
bell
of
one
of
them
the
door
opened
so
suddenly
that
walter
fell
back
a
step
he
began
stammering
out
something
but
before
he
could
finish
the
girl
sang
out
at
the
top
of
her
voice
miss
hashall
miss
hashall
there
somebody
wants
to
see
you
she
then
bolted
off
through
the
back
door
singing
i
want
to
be
an
angel
in
a
voice
that
set
walter
teeth
on
an
edge
to
make
a
long
story
short
walter
soon
struck
a
bargain
with
the
landlady
a
fat
pudgy
person
in
a
greasy
black
poplin
wearing
a
false
front
false
teeth
and
false
stones
in
her
breastpin
true
walter
silently
resented
her
demanding
a
week
board
in
advance
it
seemed
so
like
a
reflection
upon
his
honesty
but
was
easily
mollified
by
the
motherly
interest
she
seemed
to
take
in
him
or
his
cash
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
walter
sallied
out
in
search
of
work
his
landlady
had
told
him
to
apply
at
the
first
loft
he
came
to
why
you
ca
make
no
mistake
the
woman
declared
they
all
drove
to
death
and
hands
is
scurse
as
hens
teeth
all
on
account
of
this
kalerforny
fever
what
carries
so
many
of
off
do
i
wish
i
was
a
man
i
jest
like
to
dig
gold
enough
to
buy
me
a
house
on
beacon
street
and
ride
in
my
kerridge
you
just
go
and
spunk
right
up
to
like
i
do
that
the
way
to
get
along
in
this
world
my
son
walter
landlady
had
told
him
truly
the
demand
for
vessels
for
the
california
trade
was
so
urgent
that
even
old
whaleships
were
being
overhauled
and
refitted
with
all
haste
and
as
walter
walked
along
he
noticed
that
about
every
craft
he
saw
showed
the
same
sign
in
her
rigging
for
san
francisco
with
dispatch
well
be
hanged
if
there
ai
the
old
that
father
was
mate
of
walter
exclaimed
quite
aloud
clearly
taken
by
surprise
at
seeing
an
old
acquaintance
quite
unexpectedly
in
a
strange
place
and
quickly
recognizing
her
in
spite
of
a
new
coat
of
paint
alow
and
aloft
the
riggers
were
busy
setting
up
the
standing
rigging
reeving
new
halliards
and
giving
the
old
barky
a
general
overhauling
walter
climbed
on
board
and
began
a
critical
survey
of
the
ship
rigging
high
and
low
what
yer
lookin
at
greeny
one
of
the
riggers
asked
him
at
seeing
walter
eyes
fixed
on
some
object
aloft
i
looking
at
that
irish
pennant
on
that
stay
up
there
was
the
quick
reply
this
caused
a
broad
smile
to
spread
over
the
faces
of
the
workmen
a
strand
of
marline
carelessly
left
flying
by
a
rigger
you
a
rigger
i
helped
rig
this
ship
want
a
job
yes
well
here
tossing
walter
a
let
see
you
make
this
splice
it
was
neatly
and
quickly
done
i
give
you
ten
dollars
a
week
walter
held
out
for
twelve
and
after
some
demurring
on
the
part
of
the
boss
a
bargain
was
struck
walter
overalls
were
rolled
up
in
a
paper
under
his
arm
so
that
he
was
immediately
ready
to
begin
work
being
as
it
were
in
the
midst
of
the
stream
of
visitors
to
the
ship
hearing
no
end
of
talk
about
the
wonderful
fortunes
to
be
made
in
the
land
of
gold
walter
did
not
wholly
escape
the
prevailing
frenzy
for
such
it
was
but
knowing
that
he
had
not
the
means
of
paying
for
his
passage
walter
resolutely
kept
at
work
and
let
the
troubled
stream
pass
by
there
was
still
another
obstacle
he
would
have
to
leave
behind
him
a
widowed
aunt
whose
means
of
support
were
strictly
limited
to
her
actual
wants
he
had
at
once
written
to
her
of
his
good
fortune
in
obtaining
work
though
the
receipt
of
that
same
letter
had
proved
a
great
shock
to
the
poor
lone
creetur
as
she
described
herself
because
she
had
freely
given
out
among
her
neighbors
that
a
boy
who
would
run
away
from
such
a
good
home
as
walter
had
would
surely
come
to
no
good
end
walter
had
struck
up
a
rather
sudden
friendship
with
a
young
fellow
workman
of
about
his
own
age
named
charley
wormwood
on
account
of
his
name
he
was
nicknamed
bitters
charley
was
a
sort
of
chap
valuing
the
world
chiefly
for
the
amusement
it
afforded
and
finding
that
amusement
in
about
everything
and
everybody
though
mercilessly
chaffed
by
the
older
hands
charley
took
it
all
so
that
he
made
himself
a
general
favorite
the
two
young
men
soon
arranged
to
room
together
and
had
come
to
be
sworn
friends
one
pleasant
evening
as
the
two
sat
in
their
room
with
chairs
tilted
back
against
the
wall
the
following
conversation
was
begun
by
charley
i
say
walt
we
been
together
here
two
months
now
to
a
dot
and
never
a
word
have
you
said
about
your
folks
mind
now
i
do
want
to
pry
into
your
secrets
but
i
like
to
know
who
you
are
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
have
you
killed
a
man
or
broke
a
bank
or
set
a
fire
or
what
folks
think
it
funny
when
i
have
to
tell
them
i
do
know
anything
about
you
except
by
guess
and
you
know
a
mighty
poor
course
to
steer
by
pooh
you
as
close
as
an
oyster
walter
colored
to
his
temples
for
a
short
space
he
sat
eyeing
charley
without
speaking
then
he
spoke
up
with
an
evident
effort
at
as
if
the
question
so
suddenly
put
had
awakened
painful
memories
there
no
mystery
about
it
he
said
you
want
to
hear
the
story
so
be
it
then
i
tell
mine
if
you
tell
yours
i
to
an
old
whaling
port
down
on
the
cape
i
was
left
an
orphan
when
i
was
a
little
shaver
to
a
toadstool
uncle
dick
he
took
me
home
aunt
marthy
did
like
it
i
guess
all
she
said
was
me
another
mouth
to
feed
pooh
marthy
uncle
laughed
there
enough
for
two
there
enough
for
three
she
shut
up
but
she
never
liked
me
one
mite
an
orphan
interjected
charley
no
father
nor
mother
i
tell
you
about
it
you
see
my
father
went
out
mate
on
a
whaling
voyage
in
the
pacific
in
this
very
same
old
we
been
patchin
and
pluggin
up
it
may
have
been
a
year
we
got
a
letter
telling
he
was
dead
boat
he
was
in
swamped
while
fast
to
a
whale
a
big
one
they
picked
up
his
hat
sharks
took
him
i
guess
mother
was
poorly
she
fell
into
a
decline
they
called
it
and
did
live
long
we
had
nothin
but
father
wages
they
was
only
a
drop
in
the
bucket
then
there
was
only
me
left
that
was
the
time
your
uncle
took
you
home
yes
uncle
dick
was
a
rigger
by
trade
he
used
to
show
me
how
to
make
all
sorts
of
knots
and
splices
evenings
and
bimeby
he
got
me
a
chance
when
i
was
big
enough
doin
odd
jobs
like
for
a
dollar
a
week
in
the
loft
or
on
the
ships
aunt
marthy
said
a
dollar
a
week
did
begin
to
pay
for
what
i
et
guess
she
knew
pretty
soon
i
got
a
raise
to
a
but
what
made
you
quit
did
you
like
the
work
liked
it
like
it
now
but
i
could
stand
aunt
sour
looks
and
sharp
tongue
nothing
suited
her
she
was
either
as
cold
as
ice
or
as
hot
as
fire
coals
when
she
was
scolding
she
was
groaning
said
she
could
see
what
some
folks
was
born
into
this
world
just
to
slave
for
other
folks
for
a
frown
passed
over
face
at
the
recollection
nice
woman
that
observed
the
sententious
charley
but
how
about
the
uncle
he
added
could
he
make
her
hold
her
yawp
oh
no
better
man
ever
stood
he
was
like
a
father
to
me
bless
him
walter
voice
grew
a
little
shaky
here
but
he
showed
the
white
feather
to
aunt
marthy
whenever
she
went
into
one
of
her
tantrums
he
would
take
his
pipe
and
clear
out
leaving
me
to
bear
the
brunt
of
it
a
good
while
after
mother
died
father
was
brought
home
in
the
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
old
clothes
this
watch
showing
it
and
some
torn
and
greasy
with
the
courses
father
had
sailed
pricked
out
on
those
charts
made
me
sort
hanker
to
see
the
world
which
i
then
saw
men
traveled
with
the
aid
of
a
roll
of
paper
and
a
little
knowledge
as
certainly
and
as
safely
as
we
do
the
streets
of
boston
you
better
believe
i
studied
over
those
charts
some
anyhow
i
know
my
geography
and
walter
blue
eyes
lighted
up
with
a
look
of
triumph
bully
for
you
then
that
was
what
started
you
out
on
your
travels
was
it
no
i
had
often
thought
of
slipping
away
some
dark
night
but
could
make
up
my
mind
to
it
it
did
seem
so
kind
o
mean
after
all
uncle
dick
had
done
for
me
but
one
day
one
bad
day
for
me
charley
a
man
came
running
up
to
the
loft
all
out
of
breath
to
tell
me
that
uncle
dick
had
fallen
down
the
ship
hatchway
and
that
they
were
now
bringing
him
home
on
a
stretcher
i
tell
you
i
felt
sick
and
faint
when
i
saw
him
lying
there
lifeless
he
never
spoke
again
shortly
after
the
funeral
upon
going
to
the
loft
the
foreman
told
me
that
work
being
slack
they
would
have
to
lay
off
a
lot
of
hands
me
with
the
rest
before
i
went
to
sleep
that
night
i
made
up
my
mind
to
strike
out
for
myself
for
now
that
uncle
dick
was
gone
i
endure
my
life
any
longer
i
set
about
packing
up
my
duds
without
saying
anything
to
my
aunt
for
i
knew
what
a
rumpus
she
would
make
over
it
and
if
there
anything
i
hate
it
a
scene
me
too
charley
vigorously
assented
rather
take
a
lickin
well
walter
resumed
i
counted
up
my
money
first
there
was
just
dollars
lucky
number
it
was
the
year
too
i
put
ten
of
it
in
an
envelope
directed
to
my
aunt
and
put
it
on
the
where
she
could
help
seeing
it
when
she
came
into
my
room
then
i
took
a
piece
of
chalk
and
wrote
on
the
table
top
going
away
to
hunt
for
work
when
i
get
some
i
let
you
know
please
take
care
of
my
chest
look
on
the
mantelpiece
from
walter
then
like
a
thief
i
slipped
out
of
the
house
by
a
back
way
in
my
stocking
feet
and
never
stopped
running
till
i
was
out
of
town
there
i
struck
the
railroad
i
knew
if
i
followed
it
it
would
take
me
to
boston
and
it
did
that
all
iii
and
charley
tells
his
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
each
of
the
lads
being
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
apparently
they
were
not
pleasant
thoughts
what
a
tantalizing
thing
memory
sometimes
is
but
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
things
for
either
to
remain
long
speechless
walter
first
broke
silence
by
reminding
charley
of
his
promise
come
now
you
wormed
all
that
out
of
me
about
my
folks
pay
your
debts
i
should
like
to
know
what
made
you
leave
home
did
you
run
away
too
at
this
question
charley
mouth
puckered
up
queerly
and
then
quickly
broke
out
into
a
broad
grin
while
his
eyes
almost
shut
tight
at
the
recollection
walter
question
had
summoned
up
it
was
all
along
of
on
rats
he
managed
to
say
at
last
on
rats
yes
on
rats
rat
poison
you
just
wait
and
hear
me
through
i
got
a
father
somewhere
i
boys
have
i
though
whether
mine
dead
or
alive
not
knowin
ca
say
we
were
poor
as
job
turkey
if
you
know
how
poor
that
was
i
do
anyway
he
put
me
out
to
work
on
a
milk
and
chicken
farm
back
here
in
the
country
twenty
miles
or
so
to
a
man
by
the
name
of
bennett
and
then
took
himself
off
out
west
somewhere
and
you
never
seen
him
since
no
i
never
missed
him
or
the
lickin
he
give
me
well
my
boss
he
raised
lots
of
young
chickens
for
market

was
awfully
pestered
with
rats
big
fat
sassy
ones
getting
into
the
coops
nights
and
killing
off
the
little
chicks
as
soon
ever
they
was
hatched
out
you
see
they
was
tender
besides
eating
the
chicks
they
et
up
most
of
the
grain
we
throw
into
the
hens
the
boss
he
tried
everything
to
drive
those
rats
away
he
tried
cats
an
he
tried
traps
no
use
the
cats
would
tech
the
rats
nor
the
rats
go
near
the
traps
you
ca
fool
an
old
rat
much
anyhow
he
added
with
a
knowing
shake
of
his
head
well
the
boss
was
the
chicks
one
mornin
while
ladling
out
the
dough
to
those
rats
he
sputtered
out
eight
more
chicks

the
old
man
said
nothin
more
just
then
he
did
let
on
that
my
advice
was
worth
a
cent
but
i
noticed
that
he
went
off
and
bought
some
rough
on
rats
that
same
afternoon
and
when
the
old
hens
had
gone
to
roost
and
the
mother
hens
had
gathered
their
broods
under
for
the
night
uncle
he
slyly
stirred
up
a
big
dose
of
the
stuff
into
a
pan
of
meal
which
he
set
down
inside
the
henhouse
uncle
idea
was
to
get
up
early
in
the
mornin
so
to
count
up
the
dead
rats
i
but
he
did
not
get
up
early
enough
when
he
went
out
into
the
henhouse
to
investigate
he
found
fifteen
or
twenty
of
his
best
hens
lying
dead
around
the
floor
after
eatin
of
the
meal
when
i
come
outdoors
he
was
stoopin
down
with
his
back
to
me
pickin
up
walter
laughed
until
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
sobered
down
and
then
broke
out
again
charley
found
the
laugh
infectious
and
joined
in
it
though
more
moderately
go
ahead
let
have
the
rest
do
walter
entreated
what
next
i
asked
uncle
bennett
what
he
was
goin
to
do
with
all
those
dead
hens
he
flung
one
at
my
head
oh
but
he
was
mad
stop
where
you
be
my
little
joker
says
he
startin
off
for
the
stable
got
somethin
that
rough
on
brats
an
you
shall
have
a
taste
right
off
do
you
stir
a
step
shakin
his
fist
at
me
give
you
the
worst
dressin
down
you
ever
had
in
all
your
life
while
he
was
gone
for
a
horsewhip
i
lit
out
for
the
corners
you
could
have
seen
me
for
dust
i
darse
go
back
to
the
house
and
i
had
only
a
silver
ninepence
in
my
pocket
and
a
few
coppers
but
i
managed
to
beg
my
way
to
boston
oh
walt
it
was
a
long
time
between
meals
i
can
tell
you
i
slept
one
night
in
a
barn
on
the
haymow
nobody
saw
me
slip
in
after
dark
i
took
off
my
neckerchief
and
laid
it
down
within
reach
for
it
was
hot
weather
on
that
haymow
and
i
was
choked
with
the
dust
i
swallowed
i
overslept
in
the
morning
i
heard
a
noise
down
where
the
hosses
were
tied
up
some
one
was
rakin
down
hay
for
i
reached
for
my
neckerchief
thinkin
how
i
should
get
away
without
being
seen
when
a
boy
voice
gave
a
shout
towser
and
then
i
knew
it
was
all
up
for
that
boy
had
raked
down
my
neckerchief
with
the
hay
and
he
knew
there
was
a
tramp
somewhere
about
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
that
the
dog
chased
me
till
i
was
ready
to
drop
or
until
another
and
a
bigger
one
came
out
of
a
yard
and
tackled
him
then
it
was
dog
eat
dog
when
i
got
to
boston
it
was
night
i
had
no
money
i
did
know
where
to
go
tired
no
name
for
it
i
was
so
i
threw
myself
down
on
a
doorstep
and
was
asleep
in
a
minnit
there
was
an
alarm
of
fire
an
ingine
came
jolting
along
i
forgot
all
about
being
tired
and
took
holt
of
the
rope
and
ran
and
hollered
with
the
rest
the
fire
was
all
out
when
we
got
there
so
i
went
back
to
the
ingine
house
and
the
steward
let
me
sleep
in
the
cellar
a
couple
of
hours
and
wash
up
in
the
mornin
but
i
ahead
of
my
story
they
had
hot
coffee
and
crackers
and
cheese
when
they
got
back
from
the
fire
no
cheese
ever
tasted
like
that
before
give
me
a
fireman
for
a
friend
at
need
i
hung
round
that
ingine
house
till
i
picked
up
a
job
the
company
was
all
calkers
gravers
riggers
and
the
like
tough
lot
how
they
could
wallop
that
old
tub
over
the
cobblestones
to
be
sure
and
here
charley
fell
into
a
fit
of
musing
from
which
walter
did
not
attempt
to
rouse
him
in
their
past
experiences
the
two
boys
had
found
a
common
bond
iv
what
happened
on
board
the
argonaut
seeing
that
walter
also
had
fallen
into
a
brown
study
charley
quickly
changed
the
subject
see
here
walt
he
exclaimed
the
going
to
sail
for
californy
first
fair
wind
sunday
and
father
taylor
goin
to
preach
aboard
of
her
he
immense
let
go
and
hear
him
what
do
you
say
walter
jumped
at
the
proposal
i
want
to
hear
father
taylor
ever
so
much
and
i
should
mind
taking
a
look
at
the
passengers
too
sunday
came
walter
put
on
his
best
suit
and
the
two
friends
strolled
down
to
the
wharf
where
the
lay
moored
with
topsails
loosened
and
flags
and
streamers
fluttering
gayly
aloft
the
ship
was
thronged
not
only
with
those
about
to
sail
for
the
land
of
gold
but
also
with
the
friends
who
had
come
to
bid
them
besides
many
attracted
by
mere
curiosity
or
perhaps
by
the
fame
of
father
taylor
preaching
there
was
a
perfect
babel
of
voices
as
walter
was
passing
one
group
he
overheard
the
remark
she
never
get
round
the
horn
too
deep
too
many
passengers
by
half
look
at
that
bow
have
to
walk
round
her
to
tell
stem
from
starn
oh
she
get
there
fast
enough
his
companion
replied
she
knows
the
way
besides
you
ca
sink
her
she
got
lumber
enough
in
her
hold
to
keep
her
afloat
if
she
should
get
waterlogged
that
ai
the
whole
story
by
a
long
shot
a
third
speaker
broke
in
do
you
remember
the
crack
ship
that
spoke
an
old
whaler
at
sea
both
bound
out
for
california
the
passengers
on
the
crack
ship
called
out
to
the
passengers
on
the
old
whaler
to
know
if
they
wanted
to
be
reported
when
the
crack
ship
got
into
san
francisco
lo
and
behold
there
lay
the
tub
quietly
at
anchor
been
in
a
week
strange
sight
indeed
it
was
to
see
men
who
but
the
day
before
were
clerks
in
sober
tweeds
farmers
in
homespun
or
mechanics
in
greasy
overalls
now
so
dressed
up
as
to
look
far
more
like
brigands
than
peaceful
citizens
for
it
would
seem
that
to
their
notion
they
could
be
no
true
californians
unless
they
started
off
armed
to
the
teeth
so
the
poor
were
given
to
understand
how
wanting
they
were
in
the
bold
spirit
of
adventure
by
a
lavish
display
of
pistols
and
rifles
and
carbines
poor
creatures
they
little
knew
how
soon
they
were
to
meet
an
enemy
not
to
be
overcome
with
powder
and
lead
between
decks
if
the
truth
must
be
told
many
of
the
passengers
were
engaged
in
sparring
or
wrestling
bouts
playing
cards
or
shuffleboard
or
as
regardless
of
the
day
as
if
going
to
california
meant
a
cutting
loose
from
all
the
restraints
of
civilized
life
the
two
friends
made
haste
to
get
on
deck
as
they
mingled
with
the
crowd
again
walter
exchanged
quick
glances
with
a
gentleman
on
whose
arm
a
remarkably
pretty
young
lady
was
leaning
walter
was
saying
to
himself
i
wonder
where
i
have
seen
that
man
before
when
the
full
and
sonorous
voice
of
father
taylor
the
seaman
friend
hushed
the
confused
murmur
of
voices
around
him
into
a
reverential
silence
with
none
of
the
arts
and
graces
of
the
pulpit
orator
that
short
man
spoke
like
one
inspired
for
a
full
hour
and
during
that
hour
nobody
stirred
from
the
spot
where
he
had
taken
his
stand
father
taylor
every
word
had
struck
home
the
last
hymn
had
been
sung
the
last
prayer
said
at
its
ending
the
crowd
slowly
began
filing
down
the
one
long
narrow
plank
reaching
from
the
ship
gangway
to
the
wharf
nobody
seemed
to
have
noticed
that
the
rising
tide
had
lifted
this
plank
to
an
incline
that
would
make
the
descent
trying
to
weak
nerves
especially
as
there
were
five
or
six
feet
of
clear
water
to
be
passed
over
between
ship
and
shore
it
was
just
as
one
young
lady
was
in
the
act
of
stepping
upon
this
plank
that
two
young
scapegraces
ahead
of
her
ran
down
it
with
such
violence
as
to
make
it
rebound
like
a
springboard
causing
the
young
lady
first
to
lose
her
balance
then
to
make
a
false
step
and
then
to
fall
screaming
into
the
water
twenty
feet
below
everybody
ran
to
that
side
and
everybody
began
shouting
at
once
man
overboard
a
boat
get
a
boat
throw
over
a
rope
a
plank
she
going
down
help
help
but
nobody
seemed
to
have
their
wits
about
them
with
the
hundreds
looking
on
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
girl
might
drown
before
help
could
reach
her
both
charley
and
walter
had
witnessed
the
accident
coats
and
hats
were
off
in
a
jiffy
snatching
up
a
coil
of
rope
it
was
the
work
of
a
moment
for
walter
to
make
a
running
noose
slip
that
under
his
arms
sign
to
charley
to
take
a
turn
round
a
bitt
then
to
swing
himself
over
into
the
chains
and
be
lowered
down
into
the
water
on
the
run
by
the
charley
meantime
the
young
lady
father
was
almost
beside
himself
in
one
breath
he
called
to
his
daughter
by
the
name
of
dora
to
catch
at
a
rope
that
was
too
short
to
reach
her
in
the
next
he
was
offering
fifty
a
hundred
dollars
to
walter
if
he
saved
her
illustration
walter
rescuing
dora
giving
himself
a
vigorous
shove
with
his
foot
in
two
or
three
strokes
walter
was
at
the
girl
side
and
with
his
arms
around
her
it
was
high
time
too
as
her
clothes
which
had
buoyed
her
up
so
far
were
now
and
dragging
her
down
only
her
head
was
to
be
seen
above
water
at
walter
cheery
haul
away
fifty
nervous
arms
dragged
them
dripping
up
the
ship
side
the
young
lady
fell
sobbing
hysterically
into
her
father
arms
and
was
forthwith
hurried
off
into
the
cabin
while
walter
after
picking
up
his
coat
and
hat
slipped
off
through
the
crowd
gained
the
wharf
unnoticed
and
with
the
faithful
but
astonished
charley
at
his
heels
made
a
for
his
lodgings
moreover
walter
exacted
a
solemn
promise
from
charley
not
to
lisp
one
word
of
what
had
happened
on
pain
of
a
good
drubbing
my
best
suit
too
he
ruefully
exclaimed
while
divesting
himself
of
his
wet
clothes
no
matter
let
him
keep
his
old
fifty
dollars
pretty
girl
though
i
paid
ten
times
over
a
coil
of
rope
a
handy
thing
sometimes
so
a
rigger
eh
charley
charley
merely
gave
a
dissatisfied
grunt
he
was
very
far
from
understanding
such
refined
sentiments
besides
half
the
money
he
reflected
would
have
been
his
or
ought
to
have
been
which
was
much
the
same
thing
to
his
way
of
thinking
and
when
he
thought
of
the
many
things
he
could
have
done
with
his
share
the
loss
of
it
made
him
feel
very
miserable
and
more
than
half
angry
with
walter
fifty
dollars
do
grow
on
every
bush
he
muttered
then
what
lions
we
been
in
the
papers
he
lamented
you
look
here
ca
you
do
anything
without
being
paid
for
it
taken
thanks
from
the
old
duffer
but
not
money
ca
you
understand
now
you
keep
still
about
this
i
tell
you
though
still
grumbling
charley
concluded
to
hold
his
tongue
knowing
that
walter
would
be
as
good
as
his
word
but
he
inwardly
promised
himself
to
keep
his
eyes
open
and
if
ever
he
should
see
a
chance
to
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
without
walter
knowing
it
well
the
mischief
was
in
it
if
he
charley
did
improve
it
that
was
all
v
one
way
of
going
to
california
the
affair
got
into
the
newspapers
where
it
was
correctly
reported
in
the
main
except
that
the
rescuer
was
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
passengers
and
as
she
was
now
many
miles
at
sea
mr
bright
the
father
of
dora
as
a
last
resort
put
an
advertisement
in
the
daily
papers
asking
the
unknown
to
furnish
his
address
without
delay
to
his
grateful
debtors
but
as
this
failed
to
elicit
a
reply
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
walter
however
had
seen
the
advertisement
and
he
had
found
out
from
it
that
mr
bright
was
one
of
the
principal
owners
he
therefore
felt
quite
safe
from
discovery
when
he
found
himself
reported
as
having
sailed
in
that
vessel
time
moved
along
quietly
enough
with
walter
until
the
fourth
of
july
was
near
at
hand
when
it
began
to
be
noised
about
that
the
clipper
ship
then
receiving
her
finishing
touches
in
a
neighboring
yard
would
be
launched
at
high
water
on
that
eventful
day
what
was
unusual
the
nameless
ship
was
to
be
launched
fully
rigged
so
that
the
riggers
gang
was
to
take
a
hand
in
getting
her
off
the
ways
everybody
was
consequently
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
the
eventful
morning
came
at
last
it
being
a
holiday
thousands
had
repaired
to
the
spot
attracted
by
the
novelty
of
seeing
a
ship
launched
fully
rigged
at
a
given
signal
a
hundred
sledges
wielded
by
as
many
brawny
arms
began
a
furious
hammering
away
at
the
blocks
which
held
the
gallant
ship
bound
and
helpless
to
the
land
the
men
worked
like
tigers
as
if
each
and
every
one
had
a
personal
interest
in
the
success
of
the
launch
at
last
the
clatter
of
busy
hammers
ceased
the
grimy
workmen
crept
out
in
twos
and
threes
from
underneath
the
huge
black
hull
and
a
hush
fell
upon
all
that
vast
throng
so
deep
and
breathless
that
the
streamers
at
the
could
be
heard
snapping
like
so
many
whiplashes
in
the
light
breeze
aloft
all
clear
sang
out
the
master
workman
all
clear
sir
came
back
the
quick
response
all
clear
aft
the
voice
repeated
aye
aye
all
clear
still
the
towering
mass
did
not
budge
it
really
seemed
as
if
she
was
a
living
creature
hesitating
on
the
brink
of
her
own
fate
whether
to
make
the
plunge
or
not
there
was
an
anxious
moment
a
hush
fell
upon
all
that
vast
throng
then
as
the
stately
ship
was
seen
to
move
majestically
off
first
slowly
and
then
with
a
rush
and
a
leap
one
deafening
shout
went
up
from
a
thousand
throats
there
she
goes
there
she
goes
hurrah
hurrah
every
one
declared
it
the
prettiest
launch
ever
seen
just
as
the
nameless
vessel
glided
off
the
ways
a
young
lady
who
stood
upon
a
tall
scaffold
at
the
bow
quickly
dashed
a
bottle
of
wine
against
the
stem
pronouncing
as
she
did
so
the
name
that
the
good
ship
was
to
bear
henceforth
so
proudly
on
the
seas
the
three
rousing
cheers
greeted
the
act
and
the
name
the
crowd
then
began
to
disperse
as
walter
was
standing
quite
near
the
platform
erected
for
this
ceremony
his
face
all
aglow
with
the
vigorous
use
he
had
made
of
the
sledge
he
still
held
in
his
hand
the
young
lady
who
had
just
christened
the
came
down
the
stairs
in
doing
so
she
looked
master
walter
squarely
in
the
face
lo
and
behold
it
was
the
girl
of
the
the
recognition
was
instant
and
mutual
walter
turned
all
colors
at
once
giving
one
glance
at
his
greasy
duck
trousers
and
checked
shirt
his
first
impulse
was
to
sneak
off
without
a
word
but
before
he
could
do
so
he
was
confronted
by
mr
bright
himself
walter
was
thus
caught
as
it
were
between
two
fires
oh
brave
youth
of
the
stalwart
arm
and
manly
brow
thus
to
show
the
white
feather
to
that
weak
and
timid
little
maiden
noticing
the
young
man
embarrassment
mr
bright
drew
him
aside
out
of
earshot
of
those
who
still
lingered
about
so
so
my
young
friend
he
began
with
a
quizzical
look
at
walter
we
had
some
trouble
finding
you
pray
what
were
your
reasons
for
avoiding
us
neither
of
us
turning
toward
his
daughter
is
a
very
dangerous
person
as
you
may
see
for
yourself
now
do
papa
pleaded
dora
then
after
giving
a
sidelong
and
reproachful
look
at
walter
she
added
why
he
would
even
let
us
thank
him
walter
tried
to
stammer
out
something
about
not
deserving
thanks
the
words
seemed
to
stick
in
his
throat
but
he
did
manage
to
say
fifty
stood
ready
to
do
what
i
did
i
only
got
a
little
wetting
sir
just
so
but
they
did
all
the
same
come
we
are
not
ungrateful
can
i
depend
on
you
to
call
at
my
office
state
street
morning
about
ten
you
can
sir
bowing
respectfully
very
good
i
shall
expect
you
come
dora
we
must
be
going
father
and
daughter
then
left
the
yard
but
not
until
dora
had
given
walter
another
reproachful
look
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
poor
proud
and
sheepish
was
the
merchant
only
comment
upon
this
interview
as
they
walked
homeward
mentally
he
was
asking
himself
where
he
had
seen
that
face
before
dora
said
nothing
her
stolen
glances
had
told
her
however
that
walter
was
and
that
was
much
in
his
favor
to
be
sure
he
was
plainly
a
common
workman
and
he
had
appeared
very
stiff
and
awkward
when
her
father
spoke
to
him
still
she
felt
that
there
was
nothing
low
or
vulgar
about
him
punctual
to
the
minute
walter
entered
the
merchant
counting
room
though
to
say
truth
he
found
himself
ill
at
ease
in
the
presence
of
half
a
dozen
clerks
who
first
shot
sly
glances
at
him
then
at
each
other
as
he
carefully
shut
the
door
behind
him
walter
however
bore
their
scrutiny
without
flinching
he
was
only
afraid
of
girls
from
sixteen
to
eighteen
years
old
mr
bright
immediately
rose
from
his
desk
and
beckoned
walter
to
follow
him
out
into
the
warehouse
you
are
prompt
that
well
said
he
approvingly
now
then
to
business
we
want
an
outdoor
clerk
on
our
wharf
you
have
no
objection
i
take
it
to
entering
our
employment
walter
shook
his
head
oh
no
sir
very
good
then
i
tell
you
more
of
your
duties
presently
i
hear
a
good
account
of
you
the
salary
will
be
six
hundred
the
first
year
and
a
new
suit
of
clothes
in
return
for
the
one
you
spoiled
a
tailor
address
handing
walter
a
card
with
the
order
written
upon
it
go
and
get
measured
when
you
like
and
mind
you
get
a
good
fit
walter
took
a
moment
to
think
but
could
think
at
all
all
he
could
say
was
if
you
think
sir
i
can
fill
the
place
i
try
my
best
to
suit
you
that
right
try
never
was
beat
you
may
begin
walter
went
off
feeling
more
happy
than
he
remembered
ever
to
have
felt
before
in
truth
he
could
hardy
realize
his
good
fortune
this
change
in
walter
life
brought
with
it
other
changes
for
one
thing
it
broke
off
his
intimacy
with
charley
although
walter
continued
to
receive
occasional
visits
from
his
old
chum
he
also
began
attending
an
evening
school
kept
by
a
retired
schoolmaster
in
order
to
improve
his
knowledge
of
writing
spelling
and
arithmetic
or
rather
to
repair
the
neglect
of
years
for
he
now
began
to
feel
his
deficiencies
keenly
with
increasing
responsibilities
he
was
however
an
apt
scholar
and
was
soon
making
good
progress
the
work
on
the
wharf
was
far
more
to
his
liking
than
the
confinement
of
the
warehouse
could
have
been
and
walter
was
every
day
storing
up
information
which
some
time
he
believed
would
be
of
great
use
to
him
time
wore
on
one
day
round
being
much
like
another
but
once
walter
was
given
such
a
fright
that
he
did
not
get
over
it
for
weeks
he
was
sometimes
sent
to
the
bank
to
make
a
deposit
or
cash
a
check
on
this
particular
occasion
he
had
drawn
out
quite
a
large
sum
in
small
bills
to
be
used
in
paying
off
the
help
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
with
it
walter
thrust
the
roll
of
bills
into
his
trousers
pocket
it
was
raining
gently
out
of
doors
and
the
sidewalks
were
thickly
spread
with
a
coating
of
greasy
mud
there
was
another
call
or
two
to
be
made
before
walter
returned
to
the
store
at
the
head
of
the
street
walter
stopped
to
think
which
call
he
should
make
first
mechanically
he
thrust
his
hand
in
his
pocket
then
turned
as
pale
as
a
sheet
and
a
mist
passed
before
his
eyes
the
roll
of
bills
was
not
there
a
hole
in
the
pocket
told
the
whole
story
the
roll
had
slipped
out
somewhere
it
was
gone
and
through
his
own
carelessness
after
a
moment
indecision
walter
started
back
to
the
bank
carefully
looking
for
the
lost
roll
at
every
step
of
the
way
the
street
was
full
of
people
for
this
was
the
busiest
hour
of
the
day
in
vain
he
looked
and
looked
at
every
one
he
met
no
one
had
a
roll
of
bills
for
which
he
was
trying
to
find
an
owner
almost
beside
himself
he
rushed
into
the
bank
yes
the
paying
teller
remembered
him
but
was
quite
sure
the
lost
roll
had
not
been
picked
up
there
or
he
would
have
known
it
so
walter
last
and
faintest
hope
now
vanished
go
back
to
the
office
with
his
strange
story
he
dared
not
the
bank
teller
advised
his
reporting
his
loss
to
the
police
and
advertising
it
in
the
evening
editions
slowly
and
sadly
walter
retraced
his
steps
towards
the
spot
where
he
had
first
missed
his
money
inwardly
scolding
and
accusing
himself
by
turns
vexed
beyond
measure
calling
himself
all
the
fools
he
could
think
of
walter
angrily
stamped
his
foot
on
the
sidewalk
presto
out
tumbled
the
missing
roll
of
bills
from
the
bottom
of
his
when
he
brought
his
foot
down
with
such
force
it
had
been
caught
and
held
there
by
the
stiffening
material
then
fashionable
walter
went
home
that
night
thanking
his
lucky
stars
that
he
had
come
out
of
a
bad
scrape
so
easily
he
was
thinking
over
the
matter
when
charley
burst
into
the
room
i
say
walt
old
fel
do
you
want
to
buy
a
piece
of
me
he
blurted
out
tossing
his
cap
on
the
table
and
falling
into
a
chair
quite
out
of
breath
walter
simply
stared
and
for
a
minute
the
two
friends
stared
at
each
other
without
speaking
walter
at
length
demanded
are
you
crazy
charles
wormwood
what
in
the
name
of
common
sense
do
you
mean
oh
i
not
fooling
you
need
be
scared
have
you
ever
heard
of
folks
buying
pieces
of
ships
say
i
have
what
that
got
to
do
with
men
i
tell
you
look
here
when
a
feller
wants
to
go
to
californy
awful
bad
like
me
and
has
got
the
chink
like
me
he
gets
some
other
fellers
who
ca
go
like
you
to
chip
in
to
pay
his
passage
for
him
pooh
that
all
plain
sailing
when
he
earns
the
money
he
pays
it
back
walter
rejoined
no
you
all
out
just
you
hold
your
hosses
it
like
this
the
chap
who
gets
the
binds
himself
good
and
strong
mind
you
to
divide
what
he
makes
out
there
among
his
owners
to
what
they
put
into
him
same
owning
pieces
of
a
ship
ai
it
see
how
big
a
piece
you
take
finished
charley
cracking
his
knuckles
in
his
impatience
walter
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
burst
out
in
a
fit
of
uncontrollable
laughter
charley
grew
red
in
the
face
look
here
walt
you
need
have
any
if
you
do
want
it
he
took
up
his
cap
to
go
walter
stopped
him
there
you
need
get
your
back
up
old
chap
it
the
funniest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
why
it
beats
all
it
done
every
day
charley
broke
in
you
wo
lose
anything
by
me
walt
he
added
anxiously
scanning
walter
face
see
if
you
do
walter
had
saved
a
little
money
he
therefore
agreed
to
become
a
shareholder
in
charles
wormwood
esquire
to
the
tune
of
fifty
dollars
said
wormwood
duly
agreeing
and
covenanting
on
his
part
to
pay
over
dividends
as
fast
as
earned
so
the
ingenious
charley
sailed
with
as
good
a
kit
as
could
be
picked
up
in
boston
not
omitting
a
beautiful
colt
revolver
walter
gift
on
which
was
engraved
use
me
do
abuse
me
charles
was
to
work
his
passage
out
in
the
new
clipper
which
arrangement
would
land
him
in
san
francisco
with
his
capital
unimpaired
god
bless
you
charley
my
boy
stammered
walter
as
the
two
friends
wrung
each
other
hands
he
could
not
have
spoken
another
word
without
breaking
down
which
would
have
been
positive
degradation
in
a
boy
eyes
i
make
your
fortune
see
if
i
do
was
charley
cheerful
farewell
on
the
square
i
will
he
brokenly
added
the
house
of
bright
wantage
company
had
a
confidential
clerk
for
whom
walter
felt
a
secret
antipathy
from
the
first
day
they
met
we
can
not
explain
these
things
we
only
know
that
they
exist
it
may
be
a
senseless
prejudice
no
matter
we
can
not
help
it
this
name
was
ramon
ingersoll
his
manner
toward
his
fellow
clerks
was
so
and
so
condescending
that
one
and
all
thoroughly
disliked
him
some
slight
claim
ramon
was
supposed
to
have
upon
the
senior
partner
mr
bright
kept
the
junior
clerks
somewhat
in
awe
of
him
but
there
was
always
friction
in
the
when
the
clerks
were
left
alone
together
the
truth
is
that
ramon
father
had
at
one
time
acted
as
agent
for
the
house
at
matanzas
in
cuba
when
he
died
leaving
nothing
but
debts
and
this
one
orphan
child
for
he
had
buried
his
wife
some
years
before
mr
bright
had
taken
the
little
ramon
home
sent
him
to
school
paid
all
his
expenses
out
of
his
own
pocket
and
finally
given
him
a
place
of
trust
in
his
in
a
word
this
orphaned
penniless
boy
owed
everything
to
his
benefactor
as
has
been
already
mentioned
without
being
able
to
give
a
reason
for
his
belief
walter
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
ramon
would
some
day
get
him
into
trouble
fortunately
walter
duties
kept
him
mostly
outside
the
warehouse
so
that
the
two
seldom
met
one
day
ramon
with
more
than
ordinary
cordiality
asked
walter
to
visit
him
at
his
room
that
same
evening
in
order
to
meet
as
he
said
one
or
two
particular
friends
of
his
at
the
appointed
time
walter
went
without
mistrust
to
ingersoll
lodgings
upon
entering
the
room
he
found
there
two
very
men
one
of
whom
was
short
fat
and
with
an
oily
leer
lurking
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
the
other
bearded
and
scowling
with
as
walter
thought
as
desperately
villainous
a
face
as
he
had
ever
looked
upon
ah
here
you
are
at
last
cried
ramon
as
he
let
walter
in
this
is
goodman
here
the
fat
man
bowed
and
smiled
blandly
and
this
mr
lambkin
the
dark
man
looked
up
scowled
and
nodded
and
now
ramon
went
on
as
we
have
been
waiting
for
you
what
say
you
to
a
little
game
of
whist
or
or
euchre
just
to
pass
away
the
time
i
agreeable
said
goodman
though
upon
my
word
and
honor
i
hardly
know
one
card
from
another
however
just
to
make
up
your
party
i
will
take
a
hand
the
knight
of
the
gloomy
brow
silently
drew
his
chair
up
to
the
table
which
was
at
least
significant
of
his
intentions
walter
had
no
scruples
about
playing
an
innocent
game
of
whist
so
he
sat
down
with
the
others
the
game
went
on
rather
languidly
until
all
at
once
the
fat
man
broke
out
without
taking
his
eyes
off
his
cards
bless
me
why
the
strangest
thing
if
i
were
a
betting
man
i
declare
i
would
mind
risking
a
trifle
on
this
hand
ramon
laughed
as
he
replied
in
an
offhand
sort
of
way
oh
we
all
friends
here
there
no
objection
to
a
little
social
game
i
suppose
among
friends
here
he
stole
an
inquiring
look
at
walter
besides
he
continued
while
carelessly
glancing
at
his
own
hand
i
a
good
mind
to
bet
a
trifle
myself
though
still
quite
unsuspicious
walter
looked
upon
this
interruption
of
the
harmless
game
with
misgiving
all
right
goodman
resumed
here
goes
a
dollar
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
the
taciturn
lambkin
said
not
a
word
but
taking
out
a
wallet
quietly
laid
down
two
dollars
on
the
one
that
goodman
had
just
put
up
i
know
i
can
beat
them
ramon
whispered
in
walter
ear
by
jove
i
risk
it
just
this
once
no
do
walter
whispered
back
pleadingly
it
gambling
pshaw
man
it
only
for
sport
ramon
impatiently
rejoined
immediately
adding
five
dollars
of
his
own
money
to
the
three
before
him
walter
laid
down
his
cards
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
folded
his
arms
resolutely
across
his
chest
and
the
fat
man
said
he
hardly
knew
one
card
from
another
how
quick
some
folks
do
learn
he
said
to
himself
is
our
young
friend
going
to
try
his
luck
smiled
rather
than
asked
the
unctuous
goodman
no
i
never
play
for
money
was
the
quiet
response
once
the
ice
was
broken
the
game
went
on
for
higher
and
still
higher
stakes
until
walter
getting
actually
frightened
at
the
recklessness
with
which
ramon
played
and
lost
rose
to
go
after
vainly
urging
him
to
remain
annoyed
at
his
failure
to
make
walter
play
enraged
by
his
own
losses
ramon
followed
walter
outside
the
door
shut
it
behind
them
and
said
in
a
menacing
sort
of
way
not
a
word
of
this
at
the
store
promise
you
wo
play
any
more
i
wo
do
no
such
thing
who
set
you
up
for
my
guardian
if
mean
enough
to
play
the
sneak
tell
if
you
dare
walter
felt
his
anger
rising
but
controlled
himself
oh
very
well
only
remember
that
i
warned
you
he
replied
turning
away
do
preach
master
innocence
sneered
ramon
do
threaten
master
hypocrite
was
the
angry
retort
quick
as
a
flash
ramon
sprang
before
walter
and
barred
his
way
all
the
tiger
in
his
nature
gleamed
in
his
eyes
one
word
of
this
to
mr
bright
and
i
i
fix
you
he
almost
shrieked
out
with
that
the
two
young
men
clinched
and
for
a
few
minutes
nothing
could
be
heard
but
their
heavy
breathing
this
did
not
last
walter
soon
showed
himself
much
the
stronger
of
the
two
and
master
ramon
in
spite
of
his
struggles
found
himself
lying
flat
on
his
back
with
his
adversary
knee
on
his
chest
ramon
instantly
gave
in
choking
down
his
wrath
he
jerked
out
there
i
promise
let
me
up
oh
if
you
promise
so
do
i
said
walter
releasing
his
hold
on
ramon
he
then
left
the
house
without
another
word
he
did
not
see
ramon
shaking
his
fist
behind
his
back
or
hear
him
muttering
threats
of
vengeance
to
himself
as
he
went
back
to
his
vicious
companions
walter
did
wish
however
that
he
had
given
ramon
just
one
more
punch
for
keeps
so
they
parted
satisfied
that
walter
would
not
break
his
promise
ramon
made
all
haste
back
to
his
companions
laughing
in
his
sleeve
to
think
how
easily
he
had
fooled
that
milksop
seabury
his
companions
were
two
as
notorious
sharpers
as
boston
contained
he
continued
to
lose
heavily
they
luring
him
on
by
letting
him
win
now
and
then
until
they
were
satisfied
he
had
nothing
more
to
lose
at
two
in
the
morning
their
victim
rose
up
from
the
table
hardly
realizing
so
far
gone
was
he
in
liquor
that
he
was
five
hundred
dollars
in
debt
to
lambkin
or
that
he
had
signed
a
note
for
that
sum
with
the
name
of
his
employers
bright
wantage
company
he
had
found
the
road
from
gambling
to
forgery
a
natural
and
easy
one
vi
a
black
sheep
in
the
fold
leaving
ingersoll
to
follow
his
crooked
ways
we
must
now
introduce
a
character
with
whom
walter
had
formed
an
acquaintance
destined
to
have
no
small
influence
upon
his
own
future
life
bill
portlock
was
probably
as
good
a
specimen
of
an
old
battered
man
as
could
be
scared
up
between
montauk
and
quoddy
head
while
a
on
board
the
frigate
he
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
confined
in
dartmoor
prison
from
which
he
had
made
his
escape
with
some
companions
in
captivity
by
digging
a
hole
under
the
foundation
wall
with
an
old
iron
spoon
shipping
on
board
a
british
merchantman
he
had
deserted
at
the
first
neutral
port
she
touched
at
he
was
now
doing
odd
jobs
about
the
wharves
as
and
as
walter
had
thrown
many
such
in
the
old
way
a
kind
of
intimacy
had
grown
up
between
them
bill
loved
dearly
to
spin
a
yarn
and
some
of
his
adventures
told
in
his
own
vernacular
would
have
made
the
late
baron
munchausen
turn
green
with
envy
why
he
would
say
after
spinning
one
of
his
wonderful
yarns
ef
i
tell
ye
my
adventers
man
and
boy
you
think
was
roberson
crushoe
to
ye
no
need
o
lyin
sober
airnest
beats
all
they
make
up
bill
castle
was
a
condemned
caboose
left
on
the
wharf
by
some
ship
that
was
now
plowing
some
distant
sea
her
name
the
could
still
be
read
in
faded
paint
on
the
caboose
so
that
bill
always
claimed
to
belong
to
the
or
she
to
him
he
could
exactly
say
which
when
he
was
at
work
on
the
wharf
after
securing
his
castle
with
a
stout
padlock
he
announced
the
fact
to
an
inquiring
public
by
chalking
up
the
legend
aboard
the
brig
or
aboard
the
skoner
as
the
case
might
be
if
called
to
take
a
passenger
off
to
some
vessel
in
his
wherry
the
notice
would
then
read
back
at
eight
bells
a
sailor
he
was
and
a
sailor
he
said
he
would
live
and
die
no
one
but
a
sailor
and
an
old
sailor
at
that
could
have
squeezed
himself
into
the
narrow
limits
of
the
caboose
where
it
was
not
possible
even
for
a
short
man
like
bill
to
stand
upright
though
bill
himself
considered
it
quite
luxurious
living
there
was
a
rusty
old
cooking
stove
at
one
end
with
two
legs
of
its
own
and
two
replaced
by
the
other
end
being
taken
up
by
a
bench
from
which
bill
deftly
manipulated
saucepan
or
skillet
why
lor
bless
ye
said
bill
to
walter
one
evening
i
seed
ye
fish
that
ar
young
out
o
the
dock
that
time
sez
i
to
myself
a
chap
now
as
knows
a
backstay
from
a
tail
pshaw
then
after
a
moment
silence
while
bill
was
busy
lighting
his
pipe
walter
absently
asked
bill
were
you
ever
in
california
kalerforny
was
i
ever
in
kalerforny
did
i
go
out
to
sandy
ager
in
in
a
hide
drogher
and
d
know
why
they
call
it
sandy
ager
i
does
why
blow
me
if
it
ai
sandy
for
old
cape
cod
herself
and
as
for
the
ager
if
you
me
our
crew
shook
so
with
it
that
all
hands
had
to
turn
to
up
riggin
twict
a
month
it
got
so
slack
with
the
shakin
up
like
what
an
unhealthy
place
that
must
be
laughed
walter
then
suddenly
changing
the
subject
he
said
bill
you
know
the
is
a
good
two
months
overdue
bill
nodded
i
know
our
folks
are
getting
uneasy
about
her
no
wonder
valuable
cargo
and
no
insurance
your
idea
bill
gave
a
few
whiffs
at
his
pipe
before
replying
i
know
that
she
a
clipper
and
has
a
good
sailor
aboard
of
her
but
heavy
sparred
an
not
the
kind
to
be
carryin
sail
on
in
the
typhoon
season
jest
to
make
a
quick
passage
bill
shook
his
head
like
as
not
she
dismasted
or
sprung
a
leak
an
the
lord
knows
what
all
the
next
day
happened
to
be
saturday
as
walter
was
going
into
the
warehouse
he
met
ramon
coming
out
since
the
night
at
his
lodgings
his
manner
toward
walter
outwardly
at
least
had
undergone
a
marked
change
if
anything
it
was
too
cordial
hello
seabury
that
you
he
said
in
his
offhand
way
lucky
thing
you
happened
in
it
steamer
day
and
i
awfully
hard
pushed
for
time
would
you
mind
getting
this
check
on
the
suffolk
cashed
for
me
no
that
a
good
fellow
do
as
much
for
you
some
time
and
stay
on
your
way
back
call
at
the
california
steamship
agency
you
know
all
right
well
see
if
there
are
any
berths
left
in
the
you
wo
forget
the
name
the
and
oh
be
sure
to
get
gold
for
that
check
it
to
pay
duties
with
you
know
ramon
hurriedly
explained
in
an
undertone
all
right
i
understand
said
walter
walking
briskly
away
on
his
errand
he
quite
forgot
all
about
the
gold
though
until
after
he
had
left
the
bank
when
suddenly
remembering
it
he
hurried
back
to
get
the
coin
quite
flurried
and
provoked
at
his
own
forgetfulness
the
cashier
however
counted
out
the
for
the
notes
without
remark
such
little
instances
of
forgetfulness
were
too
common
to
excite
his
particular
notice
on
that
same
evening
finding
time
hanging
rather
heavily
on
his
hands
walter
strolled
uptown
in
the
direction
of
mr
bright
house
which
was
in
the
fashionable
mt
vernon
street
the
truth
is
that
the
silly
boy
thought
he
might
possibly
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
certain
young
lady
or
her
shadow
at
least
in
passing
the
brilliantly
lighted
residence
it
was
he
admitted
to
himself
a
fool
errand
after
walking
slowly
backwards
and
forwards
two
or
three
times
with
his
eyes
fastened
upon
the
lighted
windows
and
with
a
feeling
of
disappointment
he
turned
away
from
the
spot
heartily
ashamed
of
himself
as
well
for
having
given
way
to
a
sudden
impulse
glad
he
was
that
no
one
had
noticed
him
walter
queer
actions
however
did
not
escape
the
attention
of
a
certain
policeman
who
snugly
ensconced
in
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
had
watched
his
every
step
the
young
man
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
on
his
homeward
way
when
as
he
was
about
crossing
the
street
he
came
within
an
ace
of
being
knocked
down
and
run
over
by
a
passing
hack
which
turned
the
corner
at
such
a
pace
that
there
was
barely
time
to
get
out
of
the
way
there
was
a
gaslight
on
this
corner
at
walter
warning
shout
to
the
driver
the
person
inside
the
hack
quickly
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
as
quickly
drew
it
in
again
but
in
that
instant
the
light
had
shone
full
upon
the
face
of
ramon
ingersoll
the
driver
lashed
his
horses
into
a
run
walter
stood
stupidly
staring
after
the
carriage
then
without
knowing
why
he
ran
after
it
confident
that
if
he
had
recognized
ramon
in
that
brief
moment
ramon
must
also
have
recognized
him
the
best
he
could
do
however
was
to
keep
the
carriage
in
sight
but
he
soon
saw
that
it
was
heading
for
the
railway
station
at
the
south
end
out
of
breath
and
nearly
out
of
his
head
too
walter
dashed
through
the
arched
doorway
of
the
station
just
in
time
to
see
a
train
going
out
at
the
other
end
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
in
his
eagerness
walter
ran
headlong
into
the
arms
of
the
who
seeing
the
blank
look
on
walter
face
said
as
he
had
said
a
hundred
times
before
to
belated
travelers
too
late
eh
yes
yes
too
late
repeated
walter
in
a
tone
of
deep
vexation
while
walking
home
he
began
to
think
he
had
been
making
a
fool
of
himself
again
after
all
what
business
was
it
of
his
if
ramon
had
gone
to
new
york
he
might
have
gone
on
business
of
the
firm
of
course
that
was
it
and
what
right
had
he
walter
to
be
chasing
ramon
through
the
streets
anyhow
still
he
was
sure
that
ramon
had
recognized
him
and
just
as
sure
that
ramon
had
wished
to
avoid
being
recognized
else
why
had
he
not
spoken
or
even
waved
his
hand
walter
gave
it
up
and
went
home
to
dream
of
chasing
carriages
all
night
long
walter
went
to
the
wharf
as
usual
the
next
morning
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
a
porter
brought
word
that
he
was
wanted
at
the
when
walter
went
into
the
office
mr
bright
was
walking
the
floor
back
and
forth
with
hasty
steps
while
a
very
dark
man
sat
leaning
back
in
a
chair
before
the
door
this
person
immediately
arose
locked
the
office
door
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
then
quietly
sat
down
again
walter
heart
was
in
his
mouth
he
grew
red
and
pale
by
turns
before
he
could
collect
his
ideas
mr
bright
stopped
in
his
walk
looked
him
squarely
in
the
eye
and
in
an
altered
voice
demanded
sharply
and
sternly
ingersoll
where
is
he
no
prevarication
i
want
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
you
understand
walter
tried
hard
to
make
a
composed
answer
but
the
words
would
not
seem
to
come
and
the
merchant
cold
gray
eyes
seemed
searching
him
through
and
through
however
he
managed
to
stammer
out
i
know
sir
where
he
is
gone
away
has
he
do
know
gone
away
repeated
the
merchant
now
answer
me
directly
without
any
ifs
or
buts
where
and
when
did
you
see
him
last
last
night
at
least
i
thought
it
was
ramon
the
dark
man
gave
his
head
a
little
toss
well
go
on
what
then
it
was
about
nine
in
a
close
carriage
not
far
from
the
common
that
by
the
way
was
as
near
to
mr
bright
house
as
walter
thought
proper
to
locate
the
affair
mr
bright
exchanged
glances
with
the
dark
man
who
merely
nodded
but
said
never
a
word
thinking
his
examination
was
over
walter
plucked
up
the
courage
to
say
of
his
own
accord
i
ran
after
the
carriage
as
tight
as
i
could
but
you
see
sir
the
driver
was
lashing
his
horses
all
the
way
so
i
could
keep
up
with
it
and
when
i
got
to
the
depot
the
train
was
just
starting
pray
what
took
to
that
neighborhood
at
that
hour
the
silent
man
demanded
so
suddenly
that
the
sound
of
his
voice
startled
walter
if
ever
conscious
guilt
showed
itself
in
a
face
it
now
did
in
walter
he
turned
as
red
as
a
peony
mr
bright
frowned
while
the
man
smiled
a
knowing
little
smile
why
nothing
in
particular
sir
i
was
only
taking
a
little
stroll
about
town
before
going
home
walter
replied
a
word
at
a
time
yet
your
boarding
place
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
city
is
it
not
pursued
mr
bright
yes
sir
it
is
walter
seabury
up
to
this
time
i
have
always
had
a
good
opinion
of
you
this
is
no
time
for
concealments
the
house
has
been
robbed
of
a
large
sum
of
money
so
large
that
should
it
not
be
recovered
within
hours
we
must
fail
do
you
hear
fail
he
repeated
as
if
the
word
stuck
in
his
throat
and
choked
him
robbed
fail
walter
faltered
out
hardly
believing
his
own
ears
yes
robbed
and
as
i
must
believe
by
a
scoundrel
warmed
at
my
own
fireside
and
you
why
did
you
not
report
ingersoll
flight
before
it
was
too
late
to
stop
him
though
shocked
beyond
measure
by
this
revelation
walter
made
haste
to
reply
because
sir
i
was
not
sure
it
was
ramon
it
was
just
a
look
and
he
was
gone
like
a
flash
besides
besides
what
how
could
i
know
ramon
was
running
away
why
then
did
you
run
after
him
are
you
in
the
habit
of
chasing
every
carriage
you
may
chance
upon
in
the
street
again
interrupted
the
silent
man
stung
by
the
bantering
tone
of
the
stranger
walter
made
no
reply
mr
bright
was
his
employer
and
had
a
perfect
right
to
question
him
but
who
was
this
man
and
by
what
right
did
he
mix
himself
up
in
the
matter
quite
right
of
you
young
man
to
say
nothing
to
criminate
yourself
but
perhaps
you
will
condescend
to
tell
us
unless
it
would
be
betraying
confidence
again
that
cunning
smile
if
you
knew
that
this
ingersoll
was
a
gambler
the
blood
again
rushed
to
walter
temples
but
instantly
left
them
as
it
dimly
dawned
upon
him
that
he
was
suspected
of
knowing
more
than
he
was
willing
to
tell
gently
marshal
gently
interposed
mr
bright
he
will
tell
all
if
we
give
him
time
one
moment
rejoined
the
chief
with
a
meaning
look
at
the
merchant
you
hear
young
man
this
firm
has
been
robbed
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
quite
a
haul
the
thief
has
absconded
you
tell
a
pretty
straight
story
i
allow
but
before
you
are
many
hours
older
you
will
have
to
explain
why
you
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
department
should
draw
two
thousand
dollars
at
the
bank
yesterday
why
after
getting
banknotes
you
went
back
after
gold
the
marshal
continued
warming
up
as
he
piled
accusation
on
accusation
why
again
you
went
from
there
to
secure
a
berth
in
the
which
sailed
early
this
morning
and
why
you
are
seen
for
seen
you
were
first
watching
mr
bright
house
and
then
arriving
at
the
station
just
too
late
for
the
new
york
express
take
my
advice
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
affair
if
you
can
clear
yourself
now
is
the
time
if
you
ca
possibly
you
may
be
of
some
use
in
recovering
the
money
walter
felt
his
legs
giving
way
under
him
at
last
it
was
all
out
now
it
was
as
clear
as
day
how
ingersoll
had
so
craftily
managed
everything
as
to
make
walter
appear
in
the
light
of
a
confederate
now
he
knew
why
ingersoll
had
wished
to
avoid
being
recognized
in
a
broken
voice
he
told
what
he
knew
of
ingersoll
excusing
his
own
silence
by
the
pledge
he
had
given
and
received
when
he
had
finished
the
two
men
held
a
whispered
conference
together
clear
case
observed
the
marshal
one
watched
your
house
while
the
other
was
making
his
escape
i
not
believe
it
why
this
young
man
saved
my
daughter
life
think
as
you
like
at
any
rate
i
mean
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
so
saying
the
marshal
went
on
his
way
humming
a
tune
to
himself
with
as
much
unconcern
as
if
he
had
just
got
up
from
a
game
of
checkers
which
he
had
won
handily
at
the
street
corner
he
hailed
an
officer
to
whom
he
gave
an
order
in
an
undertone
and
then
walked
on
smiling
and
nodding
right
and
left
as
he
went
left
alone
with
mr
bright
walter
stood
nervously
twisting
his
cap
in
both
hands
like
a
culprit
awaiting
his
sentence
it
came
at
last
until
this
matter
is
cleared
up
mr
bright
said
we
can
not
retain
you
in
our
employ
get
what
is
due
you
you
can
go
now
he
then
turned
his
back
on
walter
and
began
busying
himself
over
the
papers
on
his
desk
walter
went
out
of
the
office
without
another
word
he
was
simply
stunned
vii
the
flight
walter
walked
slowly
down
the
wharf
feeling
as
if
the
world
had
suddenly
come
to
an
end
nothing
looked
to
him
exactly
as
it
looked
one
short
hour
ago
he
did
not
even
notice
that
a
policeman
was
keeping
a
few
rods
behind
him
as
he
walked
along
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
a
familiar
voice
hailed
him
with
why
what
ails
ye
lad
seen
a
ghost
or
what
bill
said
walter
would
you
believe
it
that
skunk
of
a
ramon
has
run
off
with
a
lot
of
the
firm
money
to
california
they
say
and
oh
bill
bill
they
suspect
me
of
having
helped
him
do
it
and
i
discharged
that
all
it
was
no
use
trying
to
keep
up
longer
walter
broke
down
completely
at
the
sound
of
a
friendly
voice
at
last
bill
silently
led
the
way
into
the
caboose
he
first
lighted
his
pipe
for
like
the
indians
bill
seemed
to
believe
that
a
good
smoke
tended
to
clear
the
intellect
he
then
save
for
an
occasional
angry
snort
or
grunt
heard
walter
through
without
interruption
when
the
wretched
story
was
all
told
bill
struck
his
open
palm
upon
his
knee
jerking
out
between
whiffs
my
eye
here
a
pretty
kettle
o
fish
ruin
failure
crash
and
smash
ship
ashore
and
you
all
taken
aback
ssh
suddenly
checking
himself
as
a
shadow
darkened
the
one
little
pane
of
glass
that
served
for
a
window
a
policeman
was
looking
in
at
them
giving
the
two
friends
a
careless
nod
he
walked
slowly
away
it
slowly
dawned
upon
walter
that
the
man
with
the
black
rosette
in
his
hat
whom
he
had
seen
at
the
office
had
set
a
watch
upon
him
bill
you
must
be
seen
talking
to
me
said
walter
rising
to
leave
they
think
you
are
in
the
plot
too
oh
oh
they
dog
me
about
everywhere
the
old
fellow
laughed
scornfully
that
he
exclaimed
snapping
his
fingers
for
the
hull
on
i
licked
many
a
perleeceman
in
my
time
and
can
do
it
again
old
as
i
am
but
we
can
be
foxy
too
i
guess
listen
when
i
sees
you
comin
i
go
acrost
the
wharf
to
where
that
brig
lays
over
there
you
foller
me
walter
nodded
i
go
up
aloft
you
follers
we
has
our
little
talk
out
in
the
maintop
free
and
easy
like
and
the
perleeceman
he
has
his
watch
below
when
walter
reached
his
boarding
house
his
landlady
met
him
in
the
entry
she
seemed
quite
flustered
and
embarrassed
oh
seabury
she
began
i
so
glad
you
come
such
a
time
there
has
been
an
officer
here
tossing
everything
in
your
room
he
would
do
it
in
spite
of
all
i
could
say
i
told
him
you
were
the
best
boarder
of
the
lot
never
out
late
nights
or
coming
home
the
worse
for
liquor
and
always
prompt
pay
do
you
think
he
told
me
to
shut
up
and
mind
my
own
business
oh
sir
what
the
matter
that
ever
a
nasty
policeman
should
came
ransacking
in
my
house
goodness
alive
why
if
it
gets
out
i
a
ruined
woman
please
sir
could
you
find
another
boarding
place
this
was
the
last
straw
for
poor
walter
without
a
word
he
crept
upstairs
to
his
little
bedroom
threw
himself
down
on
the
bed
and
cried
as
if
his
heart
would
break
walter
was
young
conscious
innocence
helped
him
to
throw
off
the
fit
of
despondency
but
in
so
far
as
feeling
goes
he
was
ten
years
older
when
he
came
out
of
it
it
was
quite
dark
lighting
a
lamp
he
hastily
threw
a
few
things
into
a
bag
scribbled
a
short
note
to
his
aunt
inclosing
the
check
received
when
he
was
discharged
settled
with
the
landlady
who
was
in
tears
always
on
tap
took
his
bag
under
his
arm
and
after
satisfying
himself
that
the
coast
was
clear
struck
out
a
roundabout
course
through
crooked
ways
and
blind
alleys
to
the
wharf
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
keep
back
a
little
bitter
laugh
when
he
called
to
mind
that
this
was
the
second
time
in
his
short
life
that
he
had
run
away
the
wharf
was
deserted
there
was
no
light
in
the
caboose
but
upon
walter
giving
three
cautious
raps
the
door
was
slid
back
and
as
quickly
closed
after
him
well
he
said
wearily
throwing
himself
down
on
a
bench
here
i
am
again
i
been
turned
out
of
doors
now
you
are
my
only
friend
left
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
in
my
place
i
ca
bear
it
and
i
wo
he
broke
out
impulsively
i
see
said
bill
meditatively
shutting
both
eyes
to
give
emphasis
to
the
assertion
nobody
will
give
me
a
place
now
with
a
cloud
like
that
hanging
over
me
bill
nodded
assent
i
ca
go
back
to
the
loft
where
i
worked
before
to
be
pointed
at
and
jeered
at
by
every
duffer
who
may
take
it
into
his
head
to
throw
this
scrape
in
my
face
would
you
as
bill
made
no
reply
but
smoked
on
in
silence
walter
exclaimed
almost
fiercely
confound
it
man
say
something
ca
you
you
drive
me
crazy
with
all
the
rest
this
time
bill
shook
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
what
would
i
do
why
if
it
was
me
i
track
the
rascal
to
the
eends
of
the
airth
and
jump
off
arter
him
but
i
have
him
and
arter
i
cotched
him
i
twist
his
neck
just
as
quick
as
i
would
a
pullet
was
bill
quiet
but
determined
reply
walter
simply
stared
though
every
nerve
in
his
body
thrilled
at
the
bare
idea
pshaw
you
do
mean
it
what
put
that
silly
notion
into
your
head
why
what
could
i
do
and
alone
against
such
a
consummate
villain
as
that
where
the
money
to
come
from
in
the
first
place
bill
watched
walter
sudden
change
from
hot
to
cold
jest
you
take
down
that
over
your
head
walter
handed
it
to
him
as
requested
first
giving
it
a
vigorous
shake
which
made
the
contents
rattle
again
with
a
metallic
sound
bill
then
raised
the
lid
showing
to
walter
astonished
eyes
a
mixture
of
copper
silver
and
even
a
few
gold
coins
half
filling
the
battered
utensil
thar
a
bank
as
never
busts
my
son
chuckled
the
old
man
at
the
same
time
turning
the
this
way
and
that
just
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
it
rattle
what
do
you
think
of
them
heh
is
it
he
continued
with
a
sniff
of
disdain
i
jest
order
my
kerridge
and
go
with
ye
my
boy
it
took
some
minutes
for
walter
to
realize
that
bill
was
in
real
downright
sober
earnest
but
bill
was
already
shoving
some
odds
and
ends
into
a
canvas
bag
to
emphasize
his
decision
strike
while
the
iron
hot
was
his
motto
walter
started
to
his
feet
with
something
of
his
old
animation
that
settles
it
he
exclaimed
since
been
turned
out
of
doors
i
feel
as
if
i
wanted
to
put
millions
of
miles
between
me
and
every
one
i
ever
known
do
you
know
i
think
every
one
i
meet
is
saying
to
himself
that
walter
seabury
suspected
of
robbing
his
employers
go
away
i
must
but
i
found
out
from
the
papers
that
no
steamer
sails
before
saturday
and
is
wednesday
you
know
where
shall
i
hide
my
face
for
a
day
or
two
how
do
i
know
they
wo
arrest
me
if
they
catch
me
trying
to
leave
the
city
oh
bill
i
can
never
stand
that
disgrace
never
having
finished
with
his
packing
bill
blew
out
the
light
pushed
back
the
slide
and
gave
a
rapid
look
up
and
down
the
wharf
as
he
drew
in
his
head
he
said
just
as
indifferently
as
if
he
had
proposed
taking
a
short
walk
about
town
to
me
as
if
the
correck
thing
for
folks
in
our
sitivation
like
was
to
cut
and
run
true
enough
for
me
but
how
about
you
they
say
that
you
were
as
deep
in
the
mud
as
i
am
in
the
mire
give
it
up
bill
no
dear
old
friend
i
must
drag
you
down
with
me
i
ca
bah
talk
wo
hurt
old
bill
nohow
bill
about
squar
with
the
world
he
owes
just
as
much
as
he
do
owe
walter
was
deeply
touched
he
saw
plainly
that
it
was
no
use
trying
to
shake
the
old
fellow
purpose
so
forbore
urging
him
further
the
old
man
waited
a
moment
for
walter
to
speak
and
finding
that
he
did
not
laid
his
big
rough
hand
on
the
lad
shoulder
and
asked
impressively
did
you
send
off
your
chist
to
your
aunt
as
i
told
ye
to
i
did
an
hour
ago
an
did
you
kind
o
explanify
things
to
the
old
gal
how
could
i
tell
her
bill
did
she
always
say
i
would
come
to
no
good
end
i
wrote
her
that
i
was
going
away
a
long
way
off
and
for
a
long
time
i
could
say
just
how
long
a
year
or
two
perhaps
my
head
was
all
anyhow
you
did
forgit
she
took
keer
on
ye
when
ye
war
a
kid
i
sent
her
the
check
i
got
from
the
store
right
away
then
i
do
see
nothin
to
hender
us
from
takin
that
little
cruise
we
was
about
it
was
when
our
two
adventurers
stepped
out
of
the
caboose
after
securing
the
door
with
a
stout
padlock
bill
silently
led
the
way
to
the
stairs
where
he
kept
his
wherry
noiselessly
the
boat
was
rowed
out
of
the
dock
toward
a
light
that
glimmered
in
the
rigging
of
an
brig
that
lay
out
in
the
stream
waiting
for
the
turning
of
the
tide
bill
did
not
speak
again
until
they
were
clear
of
the
dock
yon
brig
bound
for
york
i
know
the
old
man
i
helped
load
her
he
give
us
a
berth
if
we
take
holt
with
the
crew
here
we
are
as
he
climbed
the
brig
side
he
set
the
wherry
adrift
with
a
vigorous
shove
of
his
foot
a
day
or
two
after
the
events
just
described
mr
bright
and
the
marshal
met
on
the
street
the
former
looking
sober
and
downcast
the
latter
smiling
and
elate
what
did
i
tell
you
cried
the
marshal
evidently
well
pleased
with
the
tenor
of
the
news
he
had
to
relate
your
has
gone
off
with
an
old
wharf
rat
that
i
had
my
eye
on
for
some
time
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
marshal
my
mind
is
not
quite
easy
about
that
boy
the
merchant
replied
opportunity
makes
the
thief
the
officer
observed
carelessly
i
afraid
we
been
too
hasty
perhaps
so
but
it
my
opinion
that
when
ramon
is
found
the
other
wo
be
far
off
i
honor
your
feelings
in
this
matter
sir
but
my
experience
tells
me
that
every
rascal
asserts
his
innocence
until
his
guilt
is
proved
i
notified
the
police
of
san
francisco
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
that
precious
clerk
of
yours
sir
when
mr
bright
returned
to
the
store
on
entering
the
office
he
saw
an
elderly
woman
in
a
faded
black
bonnet
and
shawl
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
facing
the
door
with
two
bony
hands
tightly
clenched
in
her
lap
there
was
fire
in
her
eye
that
is
mr
bright
madam
one
of
the
clerks
hastened
to
say
what
can
i
do
for
you
madam
the
merchant
asked
the
woman
fixed
two
keen
gray
eyes
upon
the
speaker
face
as
she
spoke
up
quite
unabashed
by
the
quiet
dignity
of
the
manner
of
speaking
well
she
began
breathlessly
i
real
glad
to
see
you
if
you
have
kept
me
waiting
here
i
sot
an
sot
a
good
to
me
you
boston
folks
do
get
up
none
too
airly
fer
yer
i
was
down
here
before
your
shop
was
open
this
mornin
better
late
than
never
though
the
merchant
bent
his
head
politely
his
visitor
caught
her
breath
and
went
on
i
miss
marthy
seabury
what
all
this
coil
about
my
nevvy
wrote
me
that
he
was
goin
away
where
he
gone
what
he
done
that
what
i
like
to
know
right
up
an
down
she
paused
for
a
reply
never
taking
her
eyes
off
the
merchant
troubled
face
for
an
instant
my
good
woman
mr
bright
began
in
a
mollifying
tone
when
she
broke
in
upon
him
abruptly
no
palaverin
mister
no
beatin
the
bush
if
ye
please
come
to
the
i
left
my
dirty
dishes
in
the
sink
to
home
an
must
go
back
in
the
afternoon
keers
then
do
let
me
detain
you
resumed
mr
bright
gravely
there
has
been
a
defalcation
i
sorry
to
say
your
nephew
is
suspected
of
knowing
more
than
he
was
willing
to
tell
about
it
so
we
had
to
let
him
go
where
he
is
now
is
more
than
i
can
say
what
a
defalcation
a
betrayal
of
trust
madam
do
you
mean
my
boy
took
anything
that
did
belong
to
him
not
quite
that
no
indeed
at
least
i
hope
not
but
you
see
walter
is
badly
mixed
up
with
the
precious
rascal
who
did
well
you
better
not
i
like
to
see
the
man
who
say
my
boy
was
a
thief
that
all
why
i
trust
him
long
before
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
woman
actually
glared
at
every
one
in
the
office
as
if
in
search
of
some
one
willing
to
take
up
her
challenge
if
you
try
to
listen
calmly
madam
interposed
the
merchant
i
try
to
tell
you
what
we
know
he
then
went
on
to
relate
the
circumstances
already
known
to
us
aunt
martha
gave
an
indignant
sniff
when
the
merchant
had
finished
you
call
yourself
smart
eh
why
an
old
woman
sees
through
it
with
one
eye
walter
was
just
humbugged
so
was
you
war
ye
an
on
right
under
your
own
nose
ever
so
long
an
ye
none
the
wiser
well
i
declare
to
goodness
if
i
was
you
i
feel
real
downright
small
potatoes
i
think
madam
perhaps
we
had
better
bring
this
interview
to
a
close
it
is
a
very
painful
subject
i
do
assure
you
very
well
sir
i
think
you
want
to
but
mark
my
words
you
be
sorry
for
this
some
day
as
i
am
now
that
walter
ever
laid
eyes
on
you
or
your
darter
with
this
parting
shot
she
bounced
out
of
the
office
shutting
the
door
with
a
vicious
bang
behind
her
but
mr
bright
worries
that
day
were
not
to
be
so
easily
set
at
rest
upon
reaching
his
home
for
a
late
dinner
looking
pale
and
careworn
it
was
dora
who
met
him
in
the
hallway
who
put
her
arms
round
her
father
neck
and
who
kissed
him
lovingly
on
both
cheeks
dear
papa
i
know
all
she
said
with
a
little
sob
ah
he
ejaculated
then
you
have
heard
yes
papa
our
neighbor
pryor
has
told
me
all
about
it
hateful
old
thing
the
merchant
made
a
gesture
of
resignation
she
said
you
would
have
to
discharge
most
of
your
clerks
mr
bright
made
a
gesture
of
assent
then
i
want
to
do
something
i
can
give
music
lessons
i
work
my
fingers
off
to
help
i
know
i
shall
be
a
perfect
treasure
but
why
you
send
seabury
away
papa
because
he
was
unfaithful
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
appearances
are
strongly
against
him
i
do
care
i
say
it
a
wicked
shame
why
what
has
he
done
what
has
he
done
why
he
knew
ramon
gambled
and
would
tell
he
knew
ramon
had
gone
and
never
lisped
a
syllable
yes
but
that
what
he
did
do
he
was
caught
hanging
around
our
house
the
night
that
ramon
ran
away
there
child
do
bother
me
with
any
more
questions
guilty
or
not
both
have
gone
beyond
reach
dora
came
near
letting
slip
a
little
cry
of
surprise
she
knew
that
she
was
blushing
furiously
but
fortunately
the
hall
was
dark
a
new
light
had
flashed
upon
her
and
she
thought
she
could
guess
why
walter
had
been
lurking
round
their
house
on
that
to
him
most
eventful
night
although
she
had
never
exchanged
a
dozen
words
with
him
he
had
won
her
gratitude
and
admiration
fairly
and
now
she
began
to
feel
great
pity
and
sorrow
for
the
friendless
clerk
hearing
dora
crying
softly
her
father
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
and
said
soothingly
there
child
do
cry
we
must
try
to
bear
up
under
misfortune
but
is
a
thousand
pities
well
anxiously
well
if
i
had
known
all
that
in
season
the
worst
might
have
been
prevented
and
now
and
now
child
your
father
is
a
ruined
man
so
saying
the
merchant
hung
up
his
hat
and
walked
gloomily
away
dora
ran
upstairs
to
her
own
room
and
locked
herself
in
leaving
the
despondent
merchant
to
eat
his
dinner
solitary
and
alone
viii
outward
bound
beats
boston
do
it
said
bill
to
walter
as
the
was
slowly
working
her
way
up
the
east
river
past
the
miles
of
wharves
and
warehouses
with
which
the
shores
are
lined
maybe
it
bigger
but
i
do
believe
it
any
better
was
guarded
reply
as
soon
as
the
anchor
was
down
the
two
friends
hailed
a
passing
boatman
who
quickly
put
them
on
shore
at
the
battery
whence
they
lost
no
time
in
making
their
way
to
the
steamship
office
bill
to
see
if
he
could
get
a
chance
to
ship
for
the
run
to
the
isthmus
walter
to
get
a
berth
in
the
steerage
just
as
soon
as
bill
case
should
be
decided
so
eager
were
they
to
have
the
matter
settled
that
they
would
not
stop
even
to
look
at
the
wonders
of
the
town
while
waiting
their
turn
among
the
crowd
in
the
office
bill
roving
eye
happened
to
fall
on
a
big
man
who
sat
comfortably
warming
his
hands
over
a
coal
fire
in
the
fireplace
which
he
wholly
monopolized
apparently
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
it
was
now
the
month
of
december
and
the
air
was
chilly
bill
hailed
him
without
ceremony
mawnin
mister
fire
feels
kind
o
good
this
cold
mawnin
do
it
the
person
thus
addressed
did
not
even
turn
his
head
unabashed
by
this
cool
reception
bill
added
in
a
lower
tone
out
for
a
chance
to
ship
heh
matey
at
this
question
so
squarely
put
a
suppressed
titter
ran
round
the
room
the
silent
man
gave
bill
a
sidelong
look
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
absently
asked
what
makes
you
think
so
d
think
i
do
know
a
sailorman
when
i
see
one
mighty
stuck
up
some
folks
is
better
get
that
out
o
yer
hands
ef
yer
on
it
the
silent
man
rose
up
buttoned
his
shaggy
coat
up
to
his
chin
pulled
his
fur
cap
down
over
his
bushy
eyebrows
and
strode
out
of
the
office
without
looking
either
to
the
right
or
the
left
i
say
you
a
clerk
called
out
to
bill
do
you
know
who
you
were
talking
to
that
the
old
man
i
do
keer
ef
it
the
old
boy
ef
that
chap
hauled
on
a
tarred
rope
afore
now
i
a
nigger
that
all
that
was
commodore
vanderbilt
the
owner
of
this
line
the
clerk
retorted
very
pompously
quite
as
if
he
expected
bill
to
drop
the
general
laugh
now
went
against
bill
whew
was
it
though
then
i
my
cake
all
dough
he
grumbled
to
himself
but
was
greatly
relieved
when
the
shipping
clerk
after
a
few
questions
told
him
to
sign
the
articles
walter
was
duly
engaged
in
his
turn
as
a
cabin
waiter
this
being
settled
the
two
friends
sallied
forth
in
high
spirits
to
report
on
board
the
bound
for
san
juan
del
norte
nowhere
probably
since
the
days
of
noah
was
there
ever
seen
such
utter
and
seemingly
helpless
confusion
as
on
one
of
those
great
floating
arks
engaged
in
the
california
trade
by
way
of
the
isthmus
in
the
early
fifties
just
before
sailing
bullocks
were
dismally
lowing
sheep
plaintively
bleating
hogs
squealing
men
were
wildly
running
to
and
fro
shouting
pushing
and
elbowing
each
other
about
as
if
they
had
only
a
few
minutes
longer
to
live
and
must
therefore
make
the
most
of
their
time
women
were
quietly
crying
or
laughing
hysterically
by
turns
as
the
fit
happened
to
take
them
of
human
beings
upwards
of
a
thousand
were
thus
occupied
on
board
the
while
on
the
already
crowded
slip
the
shouting
of
belated
hack
drivers
who
stormed
and
swore
the
loud
cries
of
peddlers
and
newsboys
who
darted
hither
and
thither
among
the
surging
throng
served
to
keep
up
an
indescribable
uproar
add
to
this
that
the
sky
was
dark
and
lowering
the
black
river
swimming
with
floating
ice
crushing
and
grinding
against
the
slip
as
it
moved
out
to
sea
with
the
ebb
and
possibly
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
what
was
taking
place
on
that
bleak
december
afternoon
but
all
things
must
come
to
an
end
all
this
confusion
was
hushed
when
the
word
was
passed
to
cast
off
the
paddle
wheels
began
slowly
to
turn
and
the
big
ship
careening
heavily
to
port
under
its
human
freight
who
swarmed
like
bees
upon
her
decks
forged
slowly
out
into
the
stream
carrying
with
her
if
the
truth
must
be
told
many
a
sorry
and
homesick
one
already
walter
however
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
as
the
ship
moved
away
from
the
shores
it
was
the
first
moment
in
which
he
had
been
able
to
shake
off
the
fear
of
being
followed
he
therefore
went
about
his
duties
cheerfully
if
not
very
skillfully
oh
the
unspeakable
misery
of
that
first
night
at
sea
a
stiff
southeaster
was
blowing
when
the
steamer
thrust
her
black
nose
outside
of
sandy
hook
and
as
the
hours
wore
on
and
the
gale
rose
higher
and
higher
with
every
lurch
the
straining
ship
would
moan
and
tremble
like
a
human
being
in
distress
now
and
then
a
big
sea
would
strike
the
ship
fairly
sending
crockery
and
glassware
flying
about
the
cabin
with
a
crash
then
as
she
settled
down
into
the
trough
for
one
breathless
moment
it
would
seem
as
if
she
would
never
come
up
again
twenty
times
that
night
the
affrighted
passengers
gave
themselves
up
for
lost
most
of
them
lay
in
their
berths
prostrated
by
fear
or
seasickness
a
few
even
put
on
life
preservers
perhaps
a
score
or
more
too
much
terrified
even
to
seek
their
berths
crouched
with
pallid
faces
on
the
cabin
stairs
foolishly
imagining
that
if
the
ship
did
go
down
they
would
thus
have
the
better
chance
of
saving
themselves
some
women
had
even
put
on
their
bonnets
in
order
as
they
sobbed
out
to
die
decently
it
was
hardly
light
if
a
blurred
gray
streak
in
the
east
could
be
called
light
when
walter
crept
up
the
slippery
companionway
his
head
felt
like
a
balloon
his
eyes
like
two
lumps
of
lead
his
legs
like
mismatched
legs
the
ship
was
working
her
engines
just
enough
to
keep
her
head
to
the
sea
the
deck
was
all
awash
and
littered
with
the
rubbish
of
a
row
of
temporary
or
standee
bunks
abandoned
by
their
occupants
and
broken
up
by
the
force
of
the
gale
the
were
stove
and
tons
of
water
were
pouring
in
upon
the
decks
with
every
revolution
of
the
wheels
by
watching
his
chance
when
the
ship
steadied
herself
for
another
plunge
walter
managed
to
work
his
way
out
to
the
forepart
of
the
vessel
here
he
found
bill
with
half
a
dozen
more
all
hastily
swallowing
between
lurches
of
the
ship
a
cupful
of
hot
coffee
which
the
cook
was
passing
out
to
them
from
the
galley
if
ever
men
looked
completely
worn
out
then
those
men
did
bill
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
walter
than
he
offered
him
his
dipper
walter
put
it
away
from
him
with
a
grimace
of
disgust
dirty
night
said
bill
cooling
his
coffee
between
swallows
blowed
fresh
nary
watch
below
sence
we
left
the
dock
no
life
in
her
steered
like
a
wild
bull
broke
loose
in
broadway
she
some
easier
now
better
have
some
again
holding
out
his
cup
will
do
you
good
no
well
here
goes
tilting
his
head
back
and
draining
the
cup
to
the
last
drop
just
then
the
first
officer
came
bustling
along
in
oilskins
and
here
you
he
called
out
lay
there
and
get
the
jib
on
her
come
bear
a
hand
walter
went
forward
with
the
men
hoisting
the
sail
was
no
easy
matter
with
the
ship
plunging
bows
under
every
minute
but
no
sooner
did
the
gale
fill
it
fairly
than
away
it
went
with
a
report
like
a
cannon
blown
clean
out
of
the
as
if
it
had
been
a
boy
kite
held
by
a
string
while
the
men
were
watching
it
disappear
in
the
mist
crash
came
a
ton
or
more
of
salt
water
pouring
over
the
bow
throwing
them
violently
against
the
shaking
himself
like
a
spaniel
the
mate
darted
off
to
give
the
steersman
a
for
letting
the
ship
broach
to
two
sailors
had
been
lost
overboard
during
the
night
on
a
hint
dropped
by
bill
walter
was
taken
from
the
cabin
where
there
was
little
to
do
and
put
to
work
with
the
carpenter
gang
repairing
damages
the
change
being
much
to
his
liking
walter
applied
himself
to
his
new
duties
with
a
zeal
that
soon
won
for
him
the
good
will
of
his
mates
and
when
it
came
to
doing
a
job
on
the
rigging
though
out
of
practice
walter
was
always
the
one
called
upon
to
do
it
the
captain
a
quiet
gentlemanly
man
who
looked
more
like
a
schoolmaster
than
a
shipmaster
told
the
purser
to
put
walter
in
the
ship
books
thoroughly
tired
out
with
his
day
work
walter
was
going
below
when
the
mate
called
out
to
him
i
say
youngster
you
not
going
down
into
that
again
there
a
spare
bunk
in
my
stateroom
get
your
traps
and
sail
in
you
can
in
as
much
sleep
as
storage
room
for
by
noon
of
the
second
day
out
the
had
run
into
the
gulf
stream
the
gale
had
sensibly
abated
though
it
still
blew
hard
when
the
captain
came
on
deck
after
taking
a
long
look
at
the
clouds
he
said
to
the
mate
gray
i
think
you
may
give
her
the
jib
and
mainsail
to
steady
her
a
bit
at
break
of
day
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
out
as
walter
was
leaning
over
the
weather
rail
his
eye
caught
sight
of
a
dark
spot
rising
out
of
the
water
nearly
abeam
the
mate
was
taking
a
long
look
at
it
through
his
glass
in
reply
to
walter
inquiring
look
the
mate
told
him
it
was
a
reef
called
mariguana
one
of
the
easternmost
of
the
bahamas
it
was
not
long
before
most
of
the
passengers
were
crowding
up
to
get
sight
of
that
little
speck
of
dry
land
the
first
they
had
laid
eyes
on
since
the
voyage
began
now
my
lad
you
can
judge
something
of
how
columbus
felt
when
he
made
his
first
landfall
hereabouts
so
long
ago
exclaimed
the
mate
good
for
sore
eyes
ai
it
we
never
try
to
pass
it
except
in
the
daytime
he
added
if
we
did
ten
to
one
we
fetch
up
all
standing
san
domingo
cried
the
mate
rubbing
his
hands
as
he
came
out
of
the
chart
room
on
the
fifth
day
as
the
word
passed
through
the
ship
it
produced
a
magical
effect
among
the
passengers
whose
chief
desire
was
once
more
to
set
foot
on
dry
land
and
next
to
see
it
sure
enough
when
the
sun
rose
out
of
the
ocean
next
morning
there
was
the
lovely
tropic
island
looming
up
darkly
blue
before
them
there
too
were
the
hazy
mountain
peaks
of
cuba
rising
in
the
west
all
day
long
the
ship
was
sailing
between
these
islands
on
a
sea
as
smooth
as
a
millpond
every
day
she
was
getting
in
better
trim
and
going
faster
and
the
spirits
of
all
on
board
rose
accordingly
at
the
prospect
of
an
early
ending
of
the
voyage
this
beats
all
was
walter
delighted
comment
to
bill
who
was
swabbing
down
the
decks
in
his
bare
feet
is
kind
o
pooty
bill
assented
wiping
his
sweaty
face
with
his
bare
arm
that
un
nodding
toward
cuba
uncle
sam
ought
to
hev
by
good
rights
but
this
turning
on
san
domingo
a
look
of
contempt
nothin
but
niggers
airthquakes
an
harricanes
let
keep
it
says
bill
then
continuing
after
a
short
pause
porter
prince
is
up
in
the
bight
of
yon
deep
bay
i
seen
the
old

onct

a

martin

hot
if
you
was
ashore
there
you
think
it
was
hot
why
they
cook
eggs
without
fire
right
out
in
the
sun
a
run
across
the
caribbean
sea
brought
the
on
soundings
and
a
few
hours
more
to
her
destined
port
every
one
was
now
making
hurried
preparations
to
leave
the
ship
bag
and
baggage
every
eye
beamed
with
delight
at
the
prospect
of
escaping
from
the
confinement
of
what
had
seemed
more
like
a
prison
than
anything
else
while
the
was
heading
toward
her
anchorage
there
was
time
allowed
for
a
brief
survey
of
the
town
and
harbor
of
san
juan
del
norte
or
as
it
was
then
commonly
called
greytown
these
were
really
nothing
more
than
an
open
roadstead
bounded
by
a
low
curving
and
sandy
shore
along
which
half
a
hundred
poor
cabins
lay
half
hid
among
tall
cocoanut
palms
from
the
one
building
in
sight
the
british
flag
was
flying
the
harbor
however
presented
a
very
animated
and
warlike
appearance
in
consequence
of
the
warm
dispute
then
in
progress
between
england
and
the
united
states
as
to
who
should
control
the
transit
from
ocean
to
ocean
two
american
and
two
british
warships
lay
within
easy
gunshot
of
each
other
flying
the
flags
of
their
respective
nations
and
no
sooner
were
the
colors
of
the
starry
banner
caught
sight
of
than
a
tremendous
cheer
burst
from
the
thousand
throats
on
board
the
her
anchor
had
hardly
touched
bottom
when
a
boat
from
the
came
alongside
the
officer
in
charge
eagerly
hailing
the
deck
for
the
latest
news
from
the
states
as
for
the
jackies
to
judge
from
their
looks
they
seemed
literally
spoiling
for
a
fight
walter
had
no
very
clear
idea
upon
the
subject
of
this
international
dispute
still
less
of
the
importance
it
might
assume
in
the
future
but
the
evident
anxiety
shown
on
the
faces
around
him
led
him
to
suppose
that
the
matter
was
serious
he
stood
holding
onto
the
lee
rigging
watching
the
american
tars
in
the
boat
alongside
and
thinking
what
fine
manly
fellows
they
looked
when
two
passengers
near
him
began
an
animated
discussion
which
set
him
to
thinking
sare
said
one
with
a
strong
french
accent
it
was
i
shall
recollect
it
was
my
countryman
one
samuel
champlain
who
first
gave
ze
idea
of
cutting
what
you
call
him
one
sheep
canal
across
ze
eesmus
i
shall
not
be
wrong
excuse
me
monsieur
the
other
returned
i
think
cortez
did
that
very
thing
long
before
him
nevair
mind
i
you
ze
correct
eet
only
prove
zat
great
minds
always
sometime
ze
same
ideas
your
oncle
sam

sillee

doctreen
he
eez

wiz
his

he

himself
he
not
let
any
oder
dog
he
just
growl

but
monsieur
would
uncle
sam
as
you
call
him
be
a
big
fool
to
let
any
foreign
nation
get
control
of
his
road
to
california
the
frenchman
only
replied
by
a
shrug
even
before
the
dropped
anchor
she
was
surrounded
by
a
swarm
of
native
boatmen
of
all
shades
of
color
from
sour
cream
to
some
holding
up
bunches
of
bananas
some
screaming
out
praises
of
their
boats
to
such
as
were
disposed
to
go
ashore
others
begging
the
passengers
to
throw
a
dime
into
the
water
for
which
they
instantly
plunged
head
first
regardless
of
the
sharks
which
could
be
seen
lazily
swimming
about
the
harbor
attracted
by
the
offal
thrown
over
from
the
ships
i
do
know
how
is
said
bill
in
walter
ear
but
them
sharks
never
tech
a
nigger
but
come
time
to
wake
up
down
all
snug
aboard
now
keep
your
weather
eye
peeled
for
a
long
pull
across
the
isthmus
good
luck
to
ye
said
the
jolly
mate
shaking
walter
heartily
by
the
hand
as
he
was
about
leaving
the
ship
i
right
glad
to
see
been
trying
to
improve
your
mind
a
bit
instead
of
moonin
about
like
a
catfish
in
a
mudhole
as
most
of
do
on
board
here
use
your
eyes
keep
your
ears
open
and
do
be
afraid
to
ask
questions
the
way
to
travel
my
hearty
and
with
a
parting
wave
of
the
hand
he
strode
forward
ix
across
nicaragua
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
three
steamboats
wheelbarrows
bill
derisively
called
them
came
puffing
up
alongside
into
them
the
passengers
were
now
unceremoniously
bundled
like
so
many
sheep
and
in
such
numbers
as
hardly
to
allow
room
to
move
about
yet
all
in
high
glee
at
escaping
from
the
confinement
of
the
ship
at
which
many
angrily
shook
their
fists
as
the
fasts
were
cast
off
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
the
boats
were
steaming
slowly
up
the
san
juan
river
thus
commencing
the
second
stage
of
the
long
journey
for
the
first
hour
or
two
the
travelers
were
fully
occupied
in
looking
about
them
with
charmed
eyes
as
with
mile
after
mile
and
turn
after
turn
the
wonders
of
a
tropical
forest
all
hung
about
with
rare
and
beautiful
flowers
and
all
as
still
as
death
passed
before
them
but
bill
to
whom
the
sight
was
not
new
or
strange
declared
that
for
his
part
he
would
rather
have
a
sniff
of
good
old
boston
east
wind
than
all
the
cloying
perfumes
of
that
wilderness
of
woods
and
blossoms
it
was
not
long
however
before
attention
was
drawn
to
the
living
inhabitants
of
this
fairyland
first
a
strange
object
something
between
a
huge
lizard
and
a
bloated
bullfrog
was
spied
clinging
to
a
bush
on
the
bank
no
sooner
seen
than
crack
crack
went
a
dozen
pistol
shots
and
down
dropped
the
dirty
creature
with
a
loud
splash
into
the
river
there
a
tidbit
gone
observed
bill
in
walter
ear
what
eat
that
thing
demanded
walter
with
a
disgusted
look
sartin
they
eat
um
eat
anything
and
what
you
ca
eat
eat
you
if
you
do
it
look
at
that
reptyle
on
the
bank
yonder
said
bill
pointing
out
the
object
in
question
with
the
stem
of
his
pipe
walter
followed
the
direction
of
bill
pipe
looking
quite
as
much
like
a
stranded
log
as
anything
else
a
alligator
lay
stretched
out
along
the
muddy
margin
of
the
river
at
the
water
edge
no
sooner
was
he
seen
than
the
ungainly
monster
became
the
target
for
a
perfect
storm
of
bullets
all
of
which
glanced
as
harmlessly
off
his
scaly
back
as
hailstones
from
a
slate
roof
disturbed
by
the
noise
and
the
shouts
the
hideous
animal
slid
slowly
into
the
water
and
disappeared
from
sight
churning
up
the
muddy
bottom
as
he
went
bill
put
on
a
quizzical
look
as
he
asked
walter
if
he
knew
why
some
barbarians
worshiped
the
alligator
walter
was
obliged
to
admit
that
he
did
not
the
alligator
can
swaller
the
man
but
the
man
ca
swaller
the
alligator
chuckled
bill
now
and
then
a
native
bongo
would
be
overhauled
bound
for
san
carlos
grenada
or
leon
with
a
cargo
of
european
goods
they
were
boats
rigged
with
mast
and
sail
and
sometimes
thirty
to
forty
feet
long
many
a
hearty
laugh
greeted
the
grotesque
motions
of
the
rowers
who
half
rose
from
their
seats
every
time
they
dipped
their
oars
and
then
sank
back
with
a
grunt
to
give
their
strokes
more
power
the
or
master
prefaced
all
his
orders
with
a
persuasive
now
gentlemen
a
little
faster
if
you
please
and
so
that
the
way
is
it
that
all
inland
transportation
has
been
carried
on
here
for
so
many
hundred
years
thought
walter
well
i
never
incidents
such
as
these
served
now
and
then
to
cause
a
ripple
of
excitement
or
until
even
alligators
became
quite
too
numerous
to
waste
powder
upon
as
darkness
was
coming
on
fast
there
being
no
twilight
to
speak
of
in
this
part
of
the
world
a
ship
yawl
was
seen
tied
up
under
the
bank
for
the
night
its
occupants
were
nowhere
in
sight
but
the
dim
light
of
a
fire
among
the
bushes
showed
that
they
were
not
far
off
runaway
sailors
bill
explained
stole
the
boat
an
to
show
themselves
poor
devils
they
a
long
pull
afore
ef
they
get
away
an
a
behind
if
they
caught
why
how
far
is
it
across
it
more
a
hundred
miles
to
the
lake
and
another
hundred
or
so
beyond
whew
you
do
say
well
i
pity
them
when
darkness
had
shut
down
the
steamers
also
were
tied
up
to
trees
on
the
bank
scope
enough
being
given
to
the
line
to
let
the
boats
swing
clear
of
the
shores
on
account
of
the
mosquitoes
with
which
the
woods
were
fairly
alive
in
this
solitude
the
travelers
passed
their
first
night
without
other
shelter
than
the
heavens
above
and
long
before
it
was
over
there
was
good
reason
to
repent
of
the
abuse
heaped
upon
the
since
very
few
got
a
wink
of
sleep
while
all
were
more
or
less
soaked
by
the
rain
that
fell
in
torrents
as
it
can
rain
only
in
the
tropics
during
the
night
as
cold
wet
and
gloomy
as
it
dawned
the
return
of
day
was
hailed
with
delight
by
the
shivering
and
disconsolate
travelers
in
truth
much
of
the
gilding
had
already
been
washed
off
or
worn
off
of
their
el
dorado
and
as
bill
bluntly
put
it
they
all
looked
like
a
passel
of
drownded
rats
bill
made
this
remark
while
he
and
walter
were
washing
their
hands
and
faces
in
the
roily
river
water
an
easy
matter
as
they
had
only
to
stoop
over
the
side
to
do
so
the
boat
deck
being
hardly
a
foot
out
of
water
suddenly
walter
caught
bill
arm
and
gave
it
a
warning
squeeze
bill
followed
the
direction
in
which
walter
was
looking
and
gave
a
low
whistle
a
beautifully
mottled
snake
had
coiled
itself
around
the
line
by
which
the
boat
was
tied
to
the
shore
and
was
quietly
working
its
way
in
corkscrew
fashion
toward
the
now
motionless
craft
seizing
a
bill
aimed
a
savage
blow
at
the
reptile
but
the
rope
only
being
struck
the
snake
dropped
unharmed
into
the
river
do
they
raise
anything
here
besides
alligators
snakes
lizards
and
monkeys
walter
asked
the
captain
who
was
looking
on
while
sipping
his
morning
cup
of
black
coffee
glancing
up
the
captain
replied
oh
yes
they
raise
plantains
bananas
oranges
limes
lemons
cocoanuts
pardon
me
walter
interrupted
those
things
are
luxuries
i
meant
things
of
real
value
sir
a
very
proper
distinction
the
captain
replied
looking
a
little
surprised
well
then
before
you
get
across
you
will
probably
see
hundreds
of
mahogany
trees
logwood
trees
fustic
and
trees
to
say
nothing
of
other
more
or
less
valuable
growing
all
about
you
oh
yes
sir
i
seen
all
those
woods
you
tell
of
coming
out
of
vessels
at
home
but
never
growing
somehow
i
never
thought
of
them
before
as
trees
then
there
is
cochineal
indigo
sugar
indian
corn
coffee
tobacco
cotton
hides
vanilla
some
india
rubber
walter
looked
sheepish
i
see
now
how
silly
my
question
was
please
excuse
my
ignorance
that
all
right
said
the
captain
pleasantly
do
ever
be
afraid
to
ask
about
what
you
want
to
know
i
suppose
i
carried
twenty
thousand
passengers
across
and
you
are
positively
the
first
one
to
ask
about
anything
except
eating
sleeping
or
when
we
are
going
to
get
there
the
two
succeeding
days
were
like
the
first
except
that
the
river
grew
more
and
more
shallow
in
proportion
as
it
was
ascended
and
the
country
more
and
more
hilly
and
broken
this
furnished
a
new
experience
as
every
now
and
then
the
boats
would
ground
on
some
when
all
hands
would
have
to
tumble
out
into
the
water
to
lighten
them
over
the
rift
or
wade
ashore
to
be
picked
up
again
at
some
point
higher
up
after
a
fatiguing
scramble
through
the
dense
jungle
whew
this
is
what
i
calls
working
your
passage
was
quiet
comment
as
he
and
walter
stood
together
on
the
bank
breathing
hard
after
making
one
of
these
forced
excursions
for
half
a
mile
is
here
where
they
talk
of
building
a
canal
walter
asked
in
amazement
casting
an
oblique
glance
into
the
pestilential
swamps
around
him
surely
they
ca
be
in
earnest
they
need
more
than
if
they
try
it
on
was
bill
emphatic
reply
white
men
ca
stand
the
climate
nohow
and
as
for
niggers
well
all
you
can
git
out
o
clear
gain
like
lickin
a
mule
he
added
biting
off
a
chew
of
tobacco
as
he
spoke
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
the
passengers
were
landed
at
the
foot
of
the
castillio
rapids
so
named
from
an
old
spanish
fort
commanding
the
passage
of
the
river
at
this
point
though
many
years
gone
to
ruin
and
decay

and
bill
climbed
the
steep
path
leading
up
to
it
the
castle
was
of
great
age
they
were
told
going
back
to
the
time
of
the
mighty
philip
ii
of
spain
perhaps
who
spent
such
vast
sums
in
fortifying
his
american
colonies
against
the
dreaded
buccaneers
walter
could
not
help
feeling
at
the
thought
that
what
he
saw
was
already
old
when
the
pilgrims
landed
on
plymouth
rock
some
one
asked
if
this
was
not
the
place
where
england
naval
hero
lord
nelson
first
distinguished
himself
when
the
castle
was
taken
in
leaving
these
crumbling
ruins
to
the
snakes
lizards
and
other
reptiles
which
glided
away
at
their
approach
the
two
went
back
to
the
clump
of
rough
shanties
by
the
river
and
it
was
here
that
walter
made
his
first
acquaintance
with
that
class
of
adventurers
who
if
not
buccaneers
in
name
had
replaced
them
to
all
intents
not
only
here
but
on
all
routes
leading
to
the
land
of
gold
there
was
a
short
portage
around
the
rapids
a
much
larger
and
more
comfortable
boat
had
just
landed
some
hundreds
of
returning
californians
at
the
upper
end
of
this
portage
and
a
looking
lot
they
were
betraying
by
their
talk
and
actions
that
they
had
long
been
strangers
to
the
restraints
of
civilized
life
of
course
every
word
they
dropped
was
greedily
devoured
by
the
newcomers
by
whom
the
californians
were
looked
upon
as
superior
beings
the
two
sets
of
passengers
were
soon
exchanging
newspapers
or
scraps
of
news
while
their
baggage
was
being
transferred
around
the
portage
giving
walter
a
knowing
wink
bill
accosted
one
of
the
californians
with
the
question
i
say
mister
is
it
a
fact
now
that
you
can
pick
up
gold
in
the
streets
in
san
francisco
stranger
this
individual
replied
you
may
bet
your
bottom
dollar
you
can
it
done
every
day
in
the
week
you
see
a
lump
in
the
street
pick
it
up
and
put
it
in
your
pocket
until
you
come
across
a
bigger
one
then
you
heave
the
first
one
away
same
you
do
up
pebbles
on
the
beach
giving
a
nod
to
the
listeners
who
were
eagerly
devouring
every
word
the
fellow
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
off
to
join
his
companions
the
run
across
lake
nicaragua
was
made
in
the
night
when
the
passengers
awoke
the
next
morning
the
steamer
was
riding
at
anchor
at
a
cable
length
from
the
shore
on
which
a
lively
surf
was
breaking
behind
this
was
a
motley
collection
of
thatched
hovels
known
as
virgin
bay
the
passengers
were
put
ashore
in
lighters
into
which
as
many
were
huddled
as
there
was
for
were
then
hauled
to
the
beach
by
means
of
a
hawser
run
between
boat
and
shore
and
with
their
hearts
in
their
mouths
while
pitching
and
tossing
among
the
breakers
at
last
scrambled
upon
the
sands
as
best
they
might
thanking
their
lucky
stars
for
their
escape
from
drowning
the
picture
is
by
no
means
overdrawn
as
on
a
subsequent
occasion
by
the
capsizing
of
a
lighter
in
the
surf
many
passengers
were
drowned
walter
and
bill
found
themselves
standing
among
groups
of
chattering
children
old
crones
and
hairless
mules
whose
shrill
struck
into
the
general
uproar
with
horribly
discordant
note
it
was
here
bargains
were
made
for
the
transportation
of
one
self
or
baggage
across
the
intervening
range
of
mountains
to
the
pacific
secure
in
their
monopoly
of
all
the
animals
to
be
had
for
hire
the
avaricious
owners
did
not
hesitate
to
demand
as
much
for
carrying
a
trunk
sixteen
miles
as
its
whole
contents
were
worth
more
indeed
than
a
mule
would
sell
for
walter
was
gazing
on
the
novel
scene
with
eyes
already
their
little
store
of
cash
was
running
low
you
talk
to
them
bill
you
say
you
know
their
lingo
walter
suggested
impatient
at
seeing
so
many
of
the
party
mounting
their
balky
steeds
and
riding
away
bill
walked
up
to
a
mule
driver
who
stood
nearby
idly
smoking
his
cigarette
and
laying
his
hand
upon
the
animal
flank
cleared
his
throat
and
demanded
carelessly
in
broken
spanish
qui
cary
hombre
por
este
mula
the
animal
slowly
turned
his
head
toward
the
speaker
and
viciously
let
go
both
hind
feet
narrowly
missing
bill
shins
wow
he
an
infamous
rhinoceros
este
mula
cried
bill
drawing
back
to
a
safe
distance
from
the
animal
heels
si
señor
replied
the
unmoved
muleteer
viente
pesos
no
mas
he
added
in
response
to
bill
first
question
twenty
devils
exclaimed
bill
in
amazement
dropping
into
forcible
english
we
do
want
to
buy
him
then
resorting
to
gestures
to
assist
his
limited
vocabulary
he
pointed
to
his
own
and
bags
again
demanding
quantos
por
este
carga
vamos
the
ranch
over
yonder
cinco
pesos
articulated
the
impassive
owner
between
puffs
robber
muttered
bill
under
his
breath
rather
than
submit
to
be
so
outrageously
fleeced
bill
hit
upon
the
following
method
of
traveling
quite
independently
he
had
seen
it
done
in
china
he
explained
and
why
not
here
getting
a
stout
bamboo
the
two
friends
slung
their
traps
to
the
middle
lifted
it
to
their
shoulders
and
in
this
economical
fashion
trudged
off
for
the
mountains
quite
elated
at
having
so
cleverly
outwitted
the
greasers
as
bill
contemptuously
termed
them
in
fact
the
old
fellow
was
immensely
tickled
over
the
ready
transformation
of
two
live
men
into
a
quadruped
walter
should
be
fore
legs
and
he
hind
legs
when
tired
they
could
take
turn
and
turn
about
if
the
load
galled
one
shoulder
it
could
be
shifted
over
to
the
other
without
halting
hooray
he
shouted
when
they
were
clear
of
the
village
we
see
the
place
where
old
bill
boar
watered
his
hoss
in
the
pacific
balboa
bill
walter
corrected
no
horse
will
drink
salt
water
silly
you
know
better
besides
it
was
a
horse
at
all
was
a
mule
night
overtook
the
travelers
before
reaching
the
foothills
but
after
munching
a
biscuit
and
swallowing
a
few
mouthfuls
of
water
they
stretched
themselves
out
upon
the
bare
ground
and
were
soon
traveling
in
the
land
of
dreams
the
pair
were
bright
and
early
on
the
road
again
which
was
only
a
deeply
worn
and
gullied
by
the
passing
to
and
fro
of
many
a
caravan
it
soon
plunged
into
the
thick
woods
dropped
down
into
slippery
gorges
or
scrambled
up
steep
hillsides
where
the
pair
would
have
to
make
a
short
halt
to
mop
their
brows
and
get
their
breath
then
they
would
listen
to
the
screaming
of
countless
parroquets
and
watch
the
gambols
of
troops
of
chattering
monkeys
among
the
branches
overhead
bill
spoke
up
i
do
believe
men
ever
had
no
tails
like
them
monkeys
some
say
they
did
but
i
seen
many
a
time
i
like
to
had
one
myself
when
layin
out
on
a
topsail
yard
in
a
dark
night
with
nothin
much
to
stan
on
a
tail
to
kinder
quirl
around
suthin
so
to
let
you
use
your
hands
and
feet
is
kind
o
handy
just
look
at
that
chap
swingin
to
that
branch
up
there
by
his
tail
like
a
trapeze
performer
an
no
rush
o
blood
to
the
brain
nuther
walter
could
hardly
drag
bill
away
from
the
contemplation
of
this
interesting
problem
for
six
mortal
hours
the
travelers
were
shut
up
in
the
gloomy
tropical
forest
but
just
at
the
close
of
day
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
suddenly
stepped
out
of
darkness
into
light
for
far
and
wide
before
them
lay
the
mighty
pacific
ocean
crimsoned
by
the
setting
sun
once
seen
it
was
a
sight
never
to
be
forgotten
walter
and
bill
soon
pushed
on
down
the
mountain
into
the
village
of
san
juan
del
sur
of
which
the
less
said
the
better
thoroughly
tired
out
by
their
day
tramp
the
wayfarers
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
night
lodging
in
an
old
tent
at
the
rate
of
four
bits
each
it
consisted
in
the
privilege
of
throwing
themselves
down
upon
the
loose
sand
already
occupied
by
millions
of
fleas
chigoes
and
other
bedfellows
glad
enough
were
they
at
the
return
of
day
bill
eyes
were
almost
closed
and
poor
walter
face
looked
as
if
he
had
just
broken
out
with
smallpox
san
juan
del
sur
was
crowded
with
people
anxiously
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
steamship
that
was
to
take
them
on
up
the
coast
the
only
craft
in
the
little
haven
was
a
brigantine
which
had
put
in
here
for
a
supply
of
fresh
water
her
passengers
declared
that
she
worked
like
a
basket
in
a
gale
of
wind
learning
that
the
captain
was
on
shore
our
two
friends
lost
no
time
in
hunting
him
up
when
the
following
colloquy
took
place
mawnin
cap
said
bill
how
much
do
you
ax
fur
a
cabin
passage
to
a
hundred
dollars
cash

advance
but

ca

then
we
charge
eighty
dollars
to
go
anywhere
but
ca
carry
you
aloft
got
to
carry
our
provisions
there
bill
mused
a
minute
hard
case
ai
it
appealing
first
to
walter
then
to
the
captain
but
as
i
want
to
go
mighty
bad
what
you
tax
to
tow
me
the
captain
turned
away
with
a
horselaugh
and
a
shake
of
the
head
to
attend
to
his
own
affairs
leaving
our
two
friends
in
no
happy
frame
of
mind
at
the
prospect
before
them
with
the
utmost
economy
their
little
stock
of
money
would
last
but
little
longer
the
heat
was
oppressive
and
the
place
alive
with
vermin
hours
were
spent
on
the
harbor
headland
watching
for
the
friendly
smoke
of
the
overdue
steamer
several
days
now
went
by
before
the
delayed
steamer
put
in
an
appearance
it
was
none
too
soon
for
with
so
many
mouths
to
feed
the
place
began
to
be
threatened
with
famine
it
was
by
the
merest
chance
that
walter
secured
a
passage
for
himself
in
the
steerage
and
for
bill
as
a
on
this
ship
luckily
for
them
the
captain
name
happened
to
be
the
same
as
walter
he
also
hailed
from
new
bedford
he
even
admitted
though
cautiously
that
there
might
be
some
distant
relationship
so
walter
won
the
day
with
the
understanding
that
he
was
to
spread
his
blanket
on
deck
for
other
accommodations
there
were
none
while
before
the
ship
was
two
days
at
sea
men
actually
fought
for
what
were
considered
choice
spots
to
lie
down
upon
at
night
the
event
of
the
voyage
up
the
coast
was
a
stay
of
several
days
at
acapulco
for
making
repairs
in
the
engine
room
and
for
coaling
ship
what
a
glorious
harbor
it
is
and
so
sheltered
by
high
mountains
that
once
within
it
is
difficult
to
discover
where
a
ship
has
found
her
way
in
or
how
she
is
going
to
get
out
here
in
bygone
times
the
great
manila
galleons
came
with
their
rich
cargoes
which
were
then
transported
across
mexico
by
to
be
again
reshipped
to
old
spain
the
arrival
of
a
yankee
ship
was
now
the
only
event
that
stirred
the
sleepy
old
place
into
life
at
the
sound
of
her
cannon
it
rubbed
its
eyes
so
to
speak
and
woke
up
bill
even
asserted
that
the
people
looked
too
tarnation
lazy
to
draw
their
own
breath
ample
time
was
allowed
here
for
a
welcome
run
on
shore
and
the
arrival
of
another
steamer
homeward
bound
made
acapulco
for
the
time
populous
bill
could
not
get
shore
leave
so
walter
went
alone
there
were
a
without
custom
a
plaza
in
which
the
inhabitants
had
hurriedly
set
up
a
tempting
display
of
fruits
shells
lemonade
and
nicknacks
to
catch
the
passengers
loose
change
besides
a
cathedral
whose
cracked
bells
now
and
again
set
a
whole
colony
of
watchful
buzzards
lazily
flapping
about
the
and
under
the
very
shadow
of
the
cathedral
walls
a
group
of
native
mexicanos
were
busily
engaged
in
their
favorite
amusement
of
gambling
with
cards
or
in
after
sauntering
about
the
town
to
his
heart
content
walter
joined
a
knot
of
passengers
who
were
making
their
way
toward
the
dilapidated
fort
that
commands
the
basin
on
their
way
they
passed
a
squad
of
barefooted
soldiers
guarding
three
or
four
prisoners
who
were
at
work
on
the
road
and
who
shot
evil
glances
at
the
americanos
walter
thought
if
this
was
a
fair
sample
of
the
mexican
army
there
was
no
use
in
crowing
over
the
victories
won
by
scott
and
taylor
not
many
years
before
at
the
end
of
a
hot
and
dusty
walk
in
the
glare
of
a
noonday
sun
the
visitors
seated
themselves
on
the
crumbling
ramparts
of
the
old
fort
and
fell
to
swapping
news
as
the
saying
is
one
of
the
californians
was
being
teased
by
his
companions
to
tell
the
story
of
a
man
lost
overboard
on
the
trip
down
the
coast
and
while
the
others
stretched
themselves
out
in
various
attitudes
to
listen
he
after
lighting
a
cheroot
began
the
story
you
know
i
ca
tell
a
story
worth
a
cent
but
i
reckon
i
can
give
you
the
facts
if
you
want
there
was
a
queer
sort
of
chap
aboard
of
us
who
was
workin
his
passage
home
to
the
states
we
know
him
by
the
name
of
yankee
jim
he
answered
to
the
name
of
jim
and
said
as
how
he
come
from
down
east
where
they
pry
the
sun
up
every
morning
with
a
crowbar
he
did
his
turn
but
never
spoke
unless
spoken
to
we
all
reckoned
he
was
just
a
little
mite
cracked
in
the
upper
story
his
story
came
out
at
last
x
the
luck
of
yankee
jim
one
scorching
afternoon
in
july
the
hangtown
stage
rumbled
slowly
over
the
plank
road
forming
the
principal
street
of
sacramento
city
finally
coming
to
a
full
stop
in
front
of
the
el
dorado
hotel
this
particular
stage
usually
made
connection
with
the
day
boat
for
the
bay
but
on
this
occasion
it
came
in
an
hour
too
late
consequently
the
boat
was
at
that
moment
miles
away
down
the
river
upon
learning
this
disagreeable
piece
of
news
the
belated
passengers
scattered
grumbling
much
at
a
detention
which
each
took
good
care
to
explain
could
never
have
been
or
more
inconvenient
than
on
this
particular
afternoon
one
traveler
however
stood
a
moment
or
two
longer
apparently
nonplused
by
the
situation
until
his
eye
caught
the
word
bank
in
big
golden
letters
staring
at
him
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
he
crossed
over
read
it
again
from
the
curbstone
and
then
shambled
in
at
the
open
door
he
knew
not
why
but
once
within
he
felt
a
strange
desire
to
get
out
again
as
quickly
as
possible
but
this
secret
admonition
passed
unheeded
before
him
was
a
counter
extending
across
the
room
at
the
back
of
which
rose
a
solid
wall
of
brick
within
this
was
built
the
bank
vault
the
iron
door
disclosing
bags
of
coin
piled
upon
the
floor
and
shelves
from
which
the
dull
glitter
of
caught
the
visitor
eye
directly
the
middle
of
the
counter
was
occupied
by
a
pair
of
tall
scales
of
beautiful
workmanship
in
which
dust
was
weighed
while
on
a
table
behind
it
were
trays
containing
gold
and
silver
coins
a
young
man
who
was
writing
and
smoking
at
the
same
time
looked
up
as
the
stranger
walked
in
to
look
at
the
two
men
one
would
have
said
that
it
was
the
bank
clerk
who
might
be
expected
to
feel
a
presentiment
of
evil
really
the
other
was
half
bandit
in
appearance
although
he
was
alone
and
unnoticed
yet
the
stranger
manner
was
undeniably
nervous
and
suspicious
addressing
the
cashier
he
said
i
say
mister
this
yer
boat
left
ca
get
to
afore
inquiringly
that
so
the
cashier
assented
well
continued
the
miner
here
my
fix
bound
home
for
the
states
dropping
his
voice
got
two
thousand
stowed
away
do
know
a
live
in
this
yer
burg
and
might
get
knifed
in
some
fandango
see
that
so
repeated
the
unmoved
official
then
seeing
that
his
customer
had
come
to
an
end
he
said
i
reckon
you
want
to
deposit
your
money
with
us
that
the
how
of
it
stranger
lock
it
up
tight
whar
i
kin
come
fer
it
down
with
the
dust
then
observed
the
cashier
taking
the
pen
from
behind
his
ear
and
preparing
to
write
but
seeing
his
customer
cast
a
wary
glance
to
right
and
left
he
beckoned
him
to
a
more
retired
part
of
the
bank
where
the
miner
very
coolly
proceeded
to
strip
to
his
shirt
in
each
corner
of
which
five
slugs
were
knotted
an
equal
sum
in
dust
was
then
produced
from
a
buckskin
belt
all
of
which
was
received
without
a
word
of
comment
upon
the
ingenuity
with
which
it
had
been
concealed
a
certificate
of
deposit
was
then
made
out
specifying
that
james
wildes
had
that
day
deposited
with
the
mutual
confidence
and
trust
company
subject
to
his
order
two
thousand
dollars
glancing
at
the
scrap
of
crisp
paper
as
if
hardly
comprehending
how
that
could
be
an
equivalent
for
his
precious
coin
and
dust
lying
on
the
counter
before
him
jim
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
then
crumpling
the
certificate
tightly
within
his
big
brown
fist
he
exclaimed
thar
i
kin
eat
and
sleep
now
i
reckon
blamed
if
i
ever
knew
afore
what
a
coward
a
rich
man
is
our
man
it
seems
had
been
a
sailor
before
the
mast
when
the
anchor
touched
bottom
he
with
his
shipmates
started
for
the
diggings
where
he
had
toiled
with
varying
luck
but
finding
himself
at
last
in
possession
of
what
would
be
considered
a
little
fortune
in
his
native
town
he
was
now
returning
filled
with
the
hope
of
a
happy
meeting
with
the
wife
and
children
he
had
left
behind
but
while
yankee
jim
slept
soundly
and
blissfully
dreamed
of
pouring
golden
eagles
into
jane
lap
his
destiny
was
being
fulfilled
the
great
financial
storm
of
burst
upon
the
state
unheralded
and
unforeseen
like
a
thief
in
the
night
the
one
fatal
word
flashed
over
the
wires
that
shut
the
door
of
every
bank
and
made
the
boldest
turn
pale
suspension
was
followed
by
universal
panic
and
dismay
yankee
jim
was
only
an
atom
swallowed
up
in
the
general
and
overwhelming
disaster
of
that
dark
day
in
the
morning
he
went
early
to
the
bank
only
to
find
it
shut
fast
and
an
excited
and
threatening
crowd
surging
to
and
fro
before
the
doors
men
with
haggard
faces
were
talking
and
gesticulating
wildly
women
were
crying
and
wringing
their
hands
a
sudden
faintness
came
over
him
what
did
it
all
mean
mustering
courage
to
put
the
question
to
a
bystander
he
was
told
to
look
and
read
for
himself
two
ominous
words
bank
closed
told
the
whole
story
for
a
moment
or
two
the
poor
fellow
could
not
seem
to
take
in
the
full
meaning
of
the
calamity
that
had
befallen
him
but
as
it
dawned
upon
him
that
his
little
fortune
was
swept
away
and
with
it
the
hopes
that
had
opened
to
his
delighted
fancy
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
his
brain
reeled
and
he
fell
backward
in
a
fit
the
first
word
he
spoke
when
he
came
to
himself
was
home
some
kind
souls
paid
his
passage
to
where
the
sight
of
blue
water
seemed
to
revive
him
a
little
wholly
possessed
by
the
one
idea
of
getting
home
he
shipped
on
board
the
first
steamer
which
happened
to
be
ours
going
about
his
duty
like
a
man
who
sees
without
understanding
what
is
passing
around
him
my
own
knowledge
of
the
chief
actor
in
this
history
began
at
four
in
the
morning
of
the
third
day
out
the
engines
suddenly
stopped
there
was
a
hurried
trampling
of
feet
a
sudden
rattling
of
blocks
on
deck
succeeded
by
a
dead
silence
a
silence
that
could
be
felt
i
jumped
out
of
my
berth
and
ran
on
deck
how
well
i
can
recall
that
scene
the
night
was
an
utterly
dismal
one
cold
damp
and
foggy
a
pale
light
struggled
through
the
heavy
mist
but
it
was
too
thick
to
see
a
cable
length
from
the
ship
although
we
distinctly
heard
the
rattle
of
oars
at
some
distance
with
now
and
then
a
quick
shout
that
sent
our
hearts
up
into
our
mouths
we
listened
intently
no
one
spoke
no
one
needed
to
be
told
what
those
shouts
meant
how
long
it
was
i
can
not
tell
for
minutes
seemed
hours
then
but
at
last
we
heard
the
dip
of
oars
and
presently
the
boat
shot
out
of
the
fog
within
a
biscuit
toss
of
the
ship
i
remember
that
as
they
came
alongside
the
upturned
faces
of
the
men
were
white
and
pinched
one
glance
showed
that
the
search
had
been
in
vain
the
boat
was
swung
up
the
huge
paddles
struck
the
black
water
like
clods
the
huge
hulk
swung
slowly
round
to
her
helm
but
at
the
instant
when
we
were
turning
away
awed
by
the
mystery
of
this
a
cry
came
out
of
the
black
darkness
a
yell
of
agony
and
despair
that
nailed
us
to
the
deck
may
i
never
hear
the
like
again
save
me
for
god
sake
save
me
pierced
through
that
awful
silence
till
a
hundred
voices
seemed
repeating
it
the
cry
seemed
so
near
that
every
eye
instinctively
turned
to
the
spot
whence
it
proceeded
so
near
that
it
held
all
who
heard
it
in
breathless
in
sickening
suspense
had
the
sea
really
given
up
its
dead
before
one
could
count
ten
the
boat
was
again
manned
and
clear
of
the
ship
how
well
i
recall
the
bent
figure
of
the
first
officer
as
he
stood
in
the
with
the
in
his
hand
peering
off
into
the
fog
i
can
still
see
the
men
springing
like
tigers
to
their
work
again
and
the
cutter
tossing
on
the
seething
brine
astern
like
a
chip
then
the
fog
shut
them
from
our
view
but
nevermore
was
that
voice
heard
on
land
or
sea
no
doubt
it
was
the
last
agonized
shriek
of
returning
consciousness
as
the
ocean
closed
over
yankee
jim
head
at
eight
bells
we
assembled
around
the
capstan
at
our
captain
call
when
the
few
poor
effects
of
the
lost
man
were
laid
out
to
view
his
kit
contained
one
or
two
soiled
letters
a
daguerreotype
of
two
blooming
children
hand
in
hand
a
piece
of
crumpled
paper
and
a
few
articles
of
clothing
not
worth
a
picayune
i
took
notice
that
while
smoothing
out
the
creases
in
this
scrap
of
paper
the
captain
suddenly
became
deeply
attentive
then
thoughtful
then
very
red
clearing
his
throat
he
began
as
follows
it
an
old
sea
custom
to
sell
by
auction
the
kit
of
a
shipmate
who
dies
on
blue
water
you
all
know
it
a
custom
of
the
land
to
read
the
will
of
a
deceased
person
as
soon
as
the
funeral
is
over
the
man
we
lost
this
morning
shipped
by
his
or
sea
name
a
very
common
thing
among
sailors
but
i
just
found
out
his
true
one
since
i
stood
here
and
what
more
i
found
out
that
the
man
had
been
in
trouble
an
idea
strikes
me
that
he
found
it
too
heavy
for
him
god
only
knows
but
it
more
to
the
point
that
he
has
left
a
wife
and
two
children
dependent
upon
him
for
support
gentlemen
and
mates
take
off
your
hats
while
i
read
you
this
letter
the
letter
which
bore
evidence
of
having
been
read
and
read
again
ran
as
follows
oh
james
and
are
you
really
coming
home
and
with
such
a
lot
of
money
too
oh
i
ca
believe
it
all
how
happy
we
shall
be
once
more
it
makes
me
feel
just
like
a
young
girl
again
when
you
and
i
used
to
roam
in
the
berry
pastures
and
never
coveted
anything
in
the
wide
world
but
to
be
together
you
have
forgot
that
have
you
james
or
the
old
cedar
on
the
cliff
where
you
asked
me
for
your
own
wife
and
the
sky
over
us
and
the
sea
at
our
feet
all
so
beautiful
and
we
so
happy
do
come
quick
surely
god
has
helped
me
to
wait
all
this
long
weary
time
but
now
it
seems
as
if
i
could
bear
it
another
day
and
the
little
boy
james
just
your
image
it
all
he
can
say
come
home
how
can
you
have
the
heart
to
stay
in
that
wicked
place
when
the
reading
was
finished
some
of
the
women
passengers
were
crying
softly
the
men
stood
grimly
pulling
their
long
mustaches
after
a
short
pause
the
captain
read
aloud
the
fatal
certificate
of
deposit
holding
it
up
so
that
all
might
see
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
went
on
you
heard
the
story
and
can
put
this
and
that
together
when
we
get
to
panama
i
going
to
write
a
letter
to
the
widow
it
for
you
to
say
what
kind
of
a
letter
it
shall
be
now
purser
you
may
put
up
the
certificate
of
deposit
how
much
am
i
offered
how
much
said
the
purser
waving
the
worthless
bit
of
paper
to
right
and
left
ten
twenty
forty
fifty
dollars
were
bid
before
the
words
were
fairly
out
of
the
purser
mouth
then
a
woman
voice
said
seventy
another
one
hundred
and
the
men
accepting
the
challenge
ran
the
bidding
up
fifty
more
at
which
price
the
certificate
was
knocked
down
to
a
miner
who
laid
three
pieces
on
the
capstan
saying
as
he
did
so
a
patchin
boys
sell
her
agin
cap
sell
her
agin
so
the
purser
at
a
nod
from
the
captain
put
it
up
again
and
the
sale
went
on
each
buyer
in
turn
turning
the
certificate
over
to
the
purser
until
the
noble
emulation
covered
the
capstan
with
gold
stop
a
bit
purser
interrupted
captain
m
counting
the
money
that
will
do
he
continued
the
sale
is
over
here
are
just
two
thousand
dollars
the
certificate
of
deposit
is
redeemed
xi
seeing
the
sights
in
it
was
a
fine
sunny
afternoon
when
the
turned
her
prow
landward
and
stood
straight
on
for
a
break
in
the
rugged
coast
line
like
a
hound
with
its
nose
to
the
ground
in
an
hour
she
was
moving
swiftly
through
the
golden
gate
a
fort
loomed
up
at
the
right
then
a
semaphore
was
seen
working
on
a
hilltop
in
ten
minutes
more
the
last
point
was
rounded
the
last
gun
fired
and
the
city
sprung
like
magic
from
the
bleak
hillsides
of
its
noble
bay
welcomed
the
weary
travelers
with
open
arms
the
long
voyage
was
ended
the
wharf
was
already
black
with
people
when
the
steamer
came
in
sight
when
within
hailing
distance
a
perfect
storm
of
greetings
questions
and
answers
was
tossed
from
ship
to
shore
our
two
friends
scanned
the
unquiet
throng
in
vain
for
the
sight
of
one
familiar
face
no
sooner
did
the
gangplank
touch
the
wharf
than
the
crowd
rushed
on
board
women
were
being
clasped
in
loving
arms
men
were
frantically
hugging
each
other
while
this
was
passing
on
board
walter
and
bill
made
their
escape
to
the
pier
hale
and
hearty
but
as
hungry
as
bears
forty
days
had
passed
since
their
long
journey
began
what
next
our
two
adventurers
presently
found
themselves
being
hurried
along
with
the
crowd
without
the
most
remote
idea
of
where
they
were
going
as
soon
as
possible
however
bill
drew
walter
to
one
side
to
get
their
breath
and
to
take
their
bearings
as
he
phrased
it
well
said
he
clapping
walter
on
the
back
here
we
be
at
last
walter
was
staring
every
in
the
face
from
the
moment
he
had
set
foot
on
shore
his
one
controlling
thought
and
motive
had
come
back
to
him
with
full
force
come
come
that
no
way
to
set
about
the
job
observed
the
bill
one
thing

a
time

can
set
about
it
with
full
stomachs

much

you

walter
drew
from
his
pocket
a
solitary
which
looked
astonishingly
small
as
it
lay
there
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
bill
pulled
out
a
handful
of
small
change
amounting
to
half
as
much
more
but
coppers
do
pass
here
nor
anything
else
under
a
dime
i
told
observed
walter
no
matter

do
for
ballast
was
bill
reply
whose
attention
was
immediately
diverted
to
a
tempting
list
of
eatables
chalked
upon
the
of
a
restaurant
beginning
at
the
top
of
the
list
bill
began
reading
in
an
undertone
meditatively
stroking
his
chin
the
while

my
grief
he
added
with
a
long
face
as
they
walked
on
i
so
sharp
set
that
if
a
was
passin
along
i
i
could
eat
the
and
chase
the
fortunately
however
bill
was
not
driven
to
practice
cannibalism
for
just
that
moment
a
chinaman
came
shuffling
along
balancing
a
trayful
of
pies
on
his
head
bill
was
not
slow
in
hailing
the
celestial
in
pigtail
to
which
the
old
fellow
could
not
resist
giving
a
sly
tweak
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
mawnin
john
be
you
a
whig
or
at
the
same
time

same

man
allee
my
fliend
talkee
true
you
shabee
two
bitee
this
last
remark
referred
to
the
pie
which
bill
had
just
confiscated
sauntering
on
jostling
and
being
jostled
by
people
of
almost
every
nation
on
the
face
of
the
earth
they
soon
reached
the
plaza
or
great
square
of
the
city
not
many
steps
were
taken
here
when
the
strains
of
delicious
music
floated
out
to
them
from
the
doors
of
a
building
at
their
right
hand
attracted
by
the
sweet
sounds
of
home
sweet
home
our
two
wayfarers
peered
in
and
to
walter
amazement
at
least
brought
up
as
he
had
been
at
home
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
found
himself
gazing
into
the
interior
of
a
in
full
swing
and
in
broad
daylight
like
any
legitimate
business
courting
the
custom
of
every
walk
in
gentlemen
said
a
individual
who
was
standing
at
the
door
call
for
what
you
like
everything
free
here
free
lunch
free
drinks
free
cigars
walk
in
and
try
your
luck
into
my
parlor
sez
the
spider
to
the
fly
was
ironical
comment
upon
this
polite
invitation
walt
he
continued
a
moment
later
i
we
throw
our
money
away
on
that
chinee
here
grub
for
nothin
if
they
had
only
known
it
the
person
they
were
looking
for
was
inside
that
gambling
den
at
that
very
moment
after
rambling
about
until
they
were
tired
the
two
companions
looked
up
a
place
in
which
to
get
a
night
lodging
a
luxury
which
cost
them
cents
apiece
for
the
temporary
use
of
a
straw
mattress
a
consumptive
pillow
and
a
greasy
blanket
after
making
the
most
frugal
breakfast
possible
it
was
found
that
their
joint
cash
would
provide
at
the
farthest
for
only
one
meal
more
the
case
began
to
look
desperate
they
were
sitting
on
the
sill
of
the
wharf
silently
ruminating
on
the
situation
when
the
booming
of
a
cannon
announced
the
arrival
of
a
steamer
which
had
been
signaled
an
hour
earlier
from
telegraph
hill
a
swarm
of
people
was
already
setting
toward
the
plaza
the
movement
of
a
crowd
is
always
magnetic
so
walter
and
bill
followed
on
in
the
same
direction
when
within
two
blocks
of
the
plaza
they
saw
a
long
zigzag
line
of
men
and
boys
strung
out
for
that
distance
ahead
of
them
some
standing
some
leaning
against
a
friendly
awning
some
squatted
on
the
edge
of
the
plank
sidewalk
while
newcomers
were
every
moment
lengthening
out
the
already
long
queue
what
a
long
tail
our
cat
got
was
bill
pithy
remark
be
they
takin
the
census
or
what
it
was
learned
that
all
these
people
were
impatiently
waiting
for
the
opening
of
the
but
how
soon
that
event
was
likely
to
happen
nobody
could
tell
so
the
men
smoked
whistled
chaffed
every
late
arrival
and
waited
illustration
waiting
for
the
opening
of
the
on
the
instant
walter
was
struck
with
a
bright
idea
charley
had
never
written
him
one
word
it
is
true
but
as
it
was
ten
to
one
everybody
in
the
city
would
be
at
the
during
the
day
this
seemed
as
likely
a
place
as
any
to
meet
with
him
shoving
bill
into
a
vacant
place
in
the
line
walter
started
toward
the
head
of
it
staring
hard
at
every
one
and
being
stared
at
in
return
as
he
walked
slowly
along
when
nearing
the
head
without
seeing
a
familiar
face
a
man
well
placed
in
the
line
sang
out
i
say
want
a
job
what
job
hold
my
place
for
me
till
i
kin
go
git
a
bite
to
eat
i
would
in
a
minute
only
i
ca
stop
i
looking
for
some
one
said
walter
starting
on
you
ca
make
five
dollars
no
easier
this
startling
proposition
to
a
young
fellow
who
did
not
know
where
his
next
meal
was
coming
from
hit
walter
in
his
weak
spot
talk
fast
is
it
a
whack
the
hungry
man
demanded
i
been
here
two
hours
be
back
before
you
can
say
jack
robinson
this
singular
bargain
being
struck
walter
stepped
into
line
when
his
turned
to
him
with
the
remark
fool
you
had
stuck
out
for
ten
that
man
runs
a
bank
does
he
walter
innocently
inquired
what
kind
of
a
bank
a
loud
guffaw
from
the
bystanders
followed
this
reply
as
soon
as
the
hungry
man
came
back
to
claim
his
place
and
had
paid
over
his
five
dollars
walter
hurried
off
to
where
he
had
left
bill
who
stopped
him
in
his
story
with
the
whispered
words
i
seed
him
him
who
not
charley
no
duffer
walter
gave
a
low
whistle
where
here
do
you
see
i
all
on
fire
right
here
breshed
by
me
as
large
as
life
and
twice
as
sassy
oh
i
know
him
in
spite
of
his
baird
sez
i
to
myself
along
sonny
and
smoke
your
shugarette
our
turn
comin
right
along
too
bad
too
bad
you
did
follow
him
walter
was
starting
off
again
with
a
sort
of
blind
purpose
to
find
ramon
collar
him
and
make
him
disgorge
his
gains
on
the
spot
when
bill
held
him
back
tut
tut
walt
he
expostulated
if
the
lubber
sees
you
before
we
good
and
ready
to
nab
him
wo
he
be
off
in
a
jiffy
now
we
know
he
here
ai
that
something
so
much
for
so
much
lay
low
and
keep
shady
is
our
best
holt
to
such
sound
reasoning
walter
was
fain
to
give
in
besides
bill
now
insisted
upon
staying
in
the
line
until
he
could
sell
out
too
with
a
jerk
of
the
thumb
he
pointed
to
where
one
or
two
patient
waiters
were
very
comfortably
seated
on
and
in
a
husky
undertone
proposed
finding
out
where
could
be
had
taking
the
hint
walter
started
off
instanter
in
search
of
a
dealer
in
with
whom
he
quickly
struck
a
bargain
for
as
many
as
he
could
carry
by
depositing
his
as
security
the
stools
went
off
like
hot
cakes
and
at
a
good
profit
bill
too
having
got
his
price
by
patient
waiting
the
two
lucky
speculators
walked
away
to
the
first
full
meal
they
had
eaten
since
landing
the
richer
by
twenty
dollars
from
the
morning
adventure
bill
called
it
finding
money
just
like
pickin
it
up
in
the
street
xii
an
unexpected
meeting
it
was
getting
along
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
the
two
newly
fledged
speculators
turned
their
steps
to
the
waterside
bill
to
have
his
smoke
in
peace
and
quiet
while
scanning
with
critical
eye
the
various
craft
afloat
in
that
matchless
bay
something
he
saw
there
arrested
his
attention
wonderfully
by
the
way
he
grasped
walter
arm
and
stretched
out
his
long
neck
will
you
look
ef
that
ar
the
old
out
there
in
the
stream
i
a
nigger
the
old
tub
she
made
her
last
by
the
looks
topmasts
sent
down
hole
in
her
side
big
to
drive
a
yoke
of
oxen
through
ai
she
a
beauty
after
taking
a
good
look
at
the
dismantled
hulk
walter
agreed
that
it
could
be
no
other
than
the
ship
on
which
he
and
charley
met
with
their
adventure
just
before
she
sailed
it
did
seem
so
like
seeing
an
old
friend
that
walter
was
seized
with
an
eager
desire
to
go
on
board
hailing
a
whitehall
boatman
they
were
quickly
rowed
off
alongside
and
in
another
minute
found
themselves
once
more
standing
on
the
deck
a
young
fellow
in
a
guernsey
jacket
and
met
them
at
the
gangway
there
were
three
shouts
blended
in
one
walter
charley
well
i
blessed
then
there
followed
such
a
shaking
of
hands
all
round
such
a
volley
of
questions
without
waiting
for
answers
and
of
answers
without
waiting
for
questions
that
it
was
some
minutes
before
quiet
was
restored
charley
then
took
up
the
word
why
walt
old
fel
holding
him
off
at
arm
length
i
declare
i
should
hardly
have
known
you
with
that
long
hair
and
that
brown
face
yes
this
is
the
she
a
storeship
now
and
i
he
then
went
on
to
explain
that
most
of
the
fleet
of
ships
moored
ahead
and
astern
were
similarly
used
for
storing
merchandise
some
merchants
even
owning
their
own
storeships
you
see
it
safer
and
cheaper
than
keeping
the
stuff
on
shore
to
help
make
a
bonfire
of
some
dark
night
do
you
have
no
crew
bill
asked
no
we
can
hire
lightermen
same
you
hire
truckmen
in
boston
all
those
stores
you
see
built
out
over
the
water
get
in
their
goods
through
a
in
the
floor
with
fall
and
tackle
it
may
well
be
imagined
that
these
three
reunited
friends
had
a
good
long
talk
together
that
evening
charley
pulled
a
skillet
out
of
a
cupboard
on
which
he
put
some
sliced
bacon
bill
started
a
fire
in
the
cabin
stove
while
walter
made
the
coffee
presently
the
bacon
began
to
sizzle
and
the
coffee
to
bubble
then
followed
a
famous
clattering
of
knives
and
forks
as
the
joyous
trio
set
to
with
appetites
such
as
only
california
air
can
create
walter
told
his
story
first
charley
looked
as
black
as
a
thundercloud
as
ramon
villainy
was
being
exposed
bill
gave
an
angry
snort
or
grunt
to
punctuate
the
tale
walter
finished
by
saying
bitterly
i
suppose
it
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
was
charley
quick
reply
it
a
pity
if
we
three
throwing
out
his
chest
ca
cook
his
goose
for
him
bill
has
seen
him
did
you
say
he
gambled
thought
so
oh
he
wo
be
lonesome
there
plenty
more
here
of
that
stripe
gamblers
thieves
and
sharks
own
the
town
they
do
it
ai
safe
to
be
out
late
nights
alone
unless
you
got
a
colt
or
a
derringer
handy
for
fear
of
the
hounds
the
hounds
echoed
walter
and
bill
yes
the
hounds
that
what
they
call
the
here
a
storm
brewing
he
added
mysteriously
then
suddenly
changing
the
subject
he
asked
where
do
you
ranch
under
the
blue
kannerpy
i
guess
said
bill
in
a
heavy
voice
not
by
a
jugful
you
both
stop
aboard
here
with
me
i
chief
cook
and
bill
cut
out
for
a
lighterman
so
he
as
good
as
fixed
something
turn
up
for
walt
what
did
you
mean
by
ranching
walter
asked
this
is
it
this
is
my
ranch
you
hire
a
room
or
a
shanty
do
your
own
cooking
and
washing
roll
yourself
up
in
your
blanket
at
night
and
go
it
alone
as
independent
as
a
hog
on
ice
oh
you
soon
get
used
to
it
never
fear
and
like
it
too
bet
your
life
women
as
scarce
as
hens
teeth
out
here
you
ca
think
it
why
man
alive
a
nice
lady
is
such
a
curiosity
that
i
seen
all
hands
run
out
o
doors
to
get
a
sight
of
one
passin
by
come
bill
bear
a
hand
and
pull
an
armful
of
out
of
that
bale
for
both
your
beds
look
out
for
that
candle
that
a
keg
of
blastin
powder
settin
on
walt
if
i
only
known
i
was
goin
to
entertain
company
i
swep
up
a
bit
are
you
all
ready
then
one
two
three
and
out
she
goes
and
with
one
vigorous
puff
out
went
the
light
when
bill
turned
out
in
the
morning
he
found
charley
already
up
and
busying
himself
with
the
breakfast
things
what
this
craft
loaded
with
was
his
first
question
oh
a
little
of
everything
assorted
you
can
think
of
from
to
lumber
walter
was
sitting
on
a
locker
with
one
boot
on
and
the
other
in
his
hand
listening
at
hearing
the
word
lumber
he
pricked
up
his
ears
that
reminds
me
he
broke
in
bright
company
shipped
a
cargo
out
here
dead
loss
they
said
it
was
rotting
in
the
ship
that
brought
it
charley
stopped
peeling
a
potato
to
ask
her
name
the
bark
yes
a
bark
well
now
that
ai
queer
charley
continued
her
moored
just
astern
of
us
never
broke
bulk
ship
and
cargo
sold
at
auction
to
pay
freight
and
charges
went
dirt
cheap
my
boss
he
bought
in
on
a
spec
and
a
mighty
poor
spec
it
turned
out
why
everybody
got
lumber
to
burn
charley
seemed
so
glum
over
it
that
walter
was
about
to
drop
the
subject
when
charley
resumed
it
you
see
boys
he
began
where
the
shoe
pinches
i
had
scraped
together
a
tidy
little
sum
of
my
own
workin
on
ship
work
at
big
wages
sometimes
for
this
man
sometimes
for
that
i
was
thinkin
all
the
while
of
buying
off
those
folks
at
home
who
fitted
me
out
walt
here
knows
who
i
mean
when
along
comes
my
boss
and
says
to
me
say
young
feller
you
seem
a
busy
sort
of
chap
i
had
my
eye
on
you
some
time
now
i
tell
you
what
i
do
with
you
no
nonsense
now
got
any
dust
few
hundreds
says
i
then
says
he
do
mind
givin
you
a
lift
here
this
goin
to
be
sold
for
the
freight
i
buy
it
in
on
halves
you
pay
what
you
can
down
on
the
nail
the
rest
when
we
sell
out
at
a
profit
like
a
fool
i
jumped
at
the
chance
well
what
ails
you
growled
the
irrepressible
bill
that
ship
ca
git
away
moored
with
five
fathoms
o
chain
can
she
pine
boards
do
eat
nor
drink
nothin
do
they
who
said
they
did
charley
tartly
retorted
it
was
plain
to
see
that
with
him
the
was
a
sore
subject
waal
ushil
to
cry
much
over
bein
a
lumber
king
is
it
persisted
bill
in
his
hectoring
way
down
east
whar
i
come
from
they
laugh
and
grow
fat
you
do
hear
me
through
listen
to
this
my
partner
went
off
to
australia
seven
or
eight
months
ago
to
settle
up
some
old
business
there
he
said
i
not
heard
hide
nor
hair
of
him
since
every
red
cent
i
raked
and
scraped
is
tied
up
hard
and
fast
in
that
blamed
old
lumber
nobody
wants
it
and
if
they
did
i
could
give
a
clean
bill
o
sale
now
you
know
walt
why
i
never
sent
you
nothin
walter
was
struck
with
an
odd
idea
in
a
laughing
sort
of
way
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
he
said
you
need
worry
any
more
about
what
you
owe
me
charley
i
do
but
if
it
will
ease
your
mind
any
i
take
as
much
out
in
lumber
as
will
make
us
square
and
give
you
a
receipt
in
full
in
the
bargain
you
will
charley
exclaimed
with
great
animation
by
george
slapping
his
knee
it
a
bargain
take
my
share
for
what
i
owe
you
and
welcome
pass
the
papers
o
boys
put
it
in
black
an
white
have
everything
fair
and
square
interjected
the
methodical
bill
charley
brought
out
pen
and
ink
tore
a
blank
leaf
out
of
an
account
book
and
prepared
himself
to
write
the
bill
of
sale
hold
on
cried
walter
who
seemed
to
be
in
a
reckless
mood
this
morning
put
in
that
i
to
have
the
refusal
of
the
other
half
of
the
cargo
for
ninety
days
at
cost
price
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
he
laughed
by
way
of
reply
to
charley
wondering
look
for
a
minute
or
two
nothing
was
heard
except
the
scratching
of
charley
busy
pen
walter
face
was
a
study
bill
seemed
lost
in
wonder
there
down
it
is
said
charley
signing
the
paper
with
a
flourish
to
me
as
if
we
was
doin
a
big
business
on
a
small
capital
this
morning
and
now
it
done
what
on
earth
did
you
do
it
for
walt
oh
i
an
idea
said
walter
assuming
an
air
of
impenetrable
mystery
have
your
own
way
rejoined
charley
whose
mind
seemed
lightened
of
its
heavy
load
here
bill
you
put
these
dirty
dishes
in
that
bread
pan
douse
some
hot
water
over
them
there
now
look
in
that
middle
locker
and
you
find
a
bunch
of
oakum
to
wipe
with
walter
you
get
a
bucket
of
water
from
the
cask
with
the
pump
in
it
on
deck
and
fill
up
the
under
charley
active
directions
the
breakfast
things
were
soon
cleared
away
walter
then
asked
to
be
put
on
shore
giving
as
a
reason
that
he
must
find
something
to
do
without
delay
whereabouts
do
they
dig
gold
here
he
innocently
asked
at
this
question
charley
laughed
outright
he
then
told
walter
how
the
diggings
were
reached
from
there
pointing
out
the
steamboats
plying
to
points
and
then
to
distant
monte
diablo
as
the
landmark
of
the
route
there
ai
no
actual
diggin
here
in
he
went
on
to
say
but
there
gold
enough
for
them
as
is
willin
to
work
for
it
and
has
sense
enough
not
to
gamble
or
drink
it
all
away
mebbe
you
wo
get
rich
quite
so
fast
and
then
again
mebbe
you
will
sabe
queer
sitivation
for
a
lumber
king
grumbled
bill
i
did
come
out
here
to
get
rich
you
know
i
did
said
walter
excitedly
rising
and
putting
on
his
cap
with
an
air
of
determination
easy
now
urged
charley
putting
an
arm
around
walter
now
you
go
running
all
over
town
in
broad
daylight
after
that
fellow
better
send
out
the
town
crier
and
done
with
it
that
not
the
way
to
go
to
work
do
you
a
chap
in
his
shoes
wo
be
keepin
a
sharp
lookout
for
himself
bet
your
life
yes
now
look
here
my
idee
is
not
to
disturb
the
nest
until
we
ketch
the
bird
this
is
my
plan
we
three
put
in
our
nights
ranging
about
town
lookin
into
the
gambling
dens
saloons
and
hotels
if
the
skunk
is
hidin
the
time
he
come
out
of
his
hole
eh
bill
sartin
sure
was
the
decided
reply
well
then
walt
hear
to
reason
do
you
see
that
if
anything
to
be
done
the
night
our
best
holt
to
do
it
in
walter
was
not
more
than
half
convinced
could
i
have
him
arrested
on
the
strength
of
the
handbill
marshal
tukey
got
out
offering
a
reward
and
describing
ramon
to
a
hair
see
here
it
is
drawing
it
out
of
an
inside
pocket
and
holding
it
up
to
view
i
could
swear
to
him
you
know
and
so
could
bill
on
a
stack
of
bibles
bill
assented
let
me
see
it
charley
demanded
rapidly
running
his
eye
over
the
precious
document
hundred
dollars
reward
five
hundred
fiddlesticks
why
he
go
five
hundred
better
and
be
off
in
a
jiffy
with
just
a
nod
and
a
wink
from
the
officers
to
keep
out
of
the
way
a
while
having
expressed
this
opinion
charley
tossed
the
handbill
on
the
table
with
a
disdainful
sniff
walter
was
dumb
he
had
actually
thought
for
a
whole
month
that
the
mere
sight
of
this
accusing
piece
of
paper
would
make
the
guilty
wretch
fall
on
his
knees
and
beg
for
mercy
and
to
be
told
now
that
it
was
only
so
much
waste
paper
struck
him
speechless
charley
again
came
to
the
rescue
come
come
do
stand
there
looking
as
if
you
lost
every
friend
you
had
on
earth
but
brace
up
if
you
wanted
to
have
that
robber
arrested
you
should
have
gone
a
different
way
to
work
to
law
what
to
be
done
then
my
idee
is
like
this
californy
law
is
no
good
anyhow
it
on
the
side
that
has
most
dust
but
here
three
of
us
and
only
one
of
him
we
can
lay
for
him
get
him
into
some
quiet
corner
and
then
frighten
him
into
doing
what
we
say
how
that
capital
just
the
thing
i
always
said
you
had
the
best
head
of
the
three
all
right
then
cried
charley
in
his
old
sprightly
way
i
give
you
both
a
holiday
so
you
can
see
the
sights
walter
you
take
care
that
bill
do
get
lost
or
stolen
me
take
care
o
him
you
mean
bill
retorted
getting
into
the
boat
the
two
friends
then
pulled
for
the
shore
walter
first
remark
as
they
slowly
sauntered
along
was
what
a
town
wooden
houses
wooden
sidewalks
plank
streets
it
looks
as
if
everything
had
sprung
up
in
a
night
and
so
it
had
at
this
time
the
city
was
beginning
to
work
its
way
out
from
the
natural
beach
toward
deeper
water
for
as
deep
water
would
not
come
to
the
city
the
city
had
to
go
out
to
deep
water
and
as
many
of
the
coming
streets
were
as
yet
only
narrow
footways
thrust
out
over
the
shallow
waters
of
the
bay
the
entire
ragged
waterfront
seemed
cautiously
feeling
its
way
toward
its
goal
cheap
frame
buildings
were
following
these
extensions
of
new
and
old
streets
as
fast
as
piles
could
be
driven
for
them
so
that
a
famous
clattering
of
hammers
was
going
on
on
every
side
from
morning
to
night
the
two
friends
soon
had
an
exciting
experience
just
ahead
of
them
a
dray
was
being
driven
down
the
wharf
at
a
rapid
rate
making
the
loose
planks
rattle
again
in
turning
out
to
let
another
dray
pass
him
the
driver
of
the
first
went
too
near
the
edge
of
the
wharf
when
the
weight
of
horse
and
dray
suddenly
tilted
the
loose
planks
in
the
air
the
driver
gave
a
yell
and
over
into
the
dock
went
horse
dray
and
man
with
a
tremendous
splash
it
was
all
done
so
quickly
that
walter
and
bill
stood
for
a
moment
without
stirring
fortunately
their
boat
was
only
a
few
rods
off
so
both
ran
back
for
her
in
a
hurry
a
few
strokes
brought
them
to
where
the
frightened
animal
was
still
helplessly
floundering
in
the
water
dragged
down
by
the
weight
of
the
dray
the
man
was
first
pulled
into
the
boat
dripping
wet
bill
then
cut
the
traces
with
his
while
the
drayman
held
the
struggling
animal
by
the
bit
he
was
then
towed
to
the
beach
safe
and
sound
by
this
time
a
crowd
had
collected
seeing
his
rescuers
pushing
off
the
drayman
elbowed
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
and
shouted
after
them
i
say
you
this
ai
no
place
to
take
a
bath
is
it
this
ai
no
place
to
be
bashful
come
up
to
my
stand
jackson
and
sansome
and
ask
for
jack
furbish
is
your
name
furbish
asked
bill
resting
on
his
oars
yes
why
oh
nothin
only
we
lost
a
man
overboard
onct
off
cape
horn
his
name
was
furbish
well
me
i
was
lost
overboard
from
pacific
wharf
jackson
and
sansome
git
up
jim
bringing
his
blacksnake
smartly
down
on
his
horse
steaming
flanks
xiii
in
which
a
man
breaks
into
his
own
store
and
steals
his
own
safe
walter
idea
as
far
as
he
had
thought
it
out
was
to
hold
on
to
this
lumber
cargo
until
mr
bright
could
be
notified
just
how
the
matter
stood
should
the
merchant
then
choose
to
take
any
steps
toward
recovering
the
cargo
of
the
walter
thought
this
act
on
his
part
might
go
far
to
remove
the
unjust
suspicions
directed
against
himself
for
this
reason
he
had
secured
as
we
have
seen
a
refusal
of
the
cargo
long
enough
for
a
letter
to
go
and
return
walter
now
set
about
writing
his
letter
but
he
now
found
that
what
had
seemed
so
simple
at
first
was
no
easy
matter
as
he
sat
staring
vacantly
at
the
blank
paper
before
him
tears
came
into
his
eyes
for
again
the
trying
scene
in
the
merchant
rushed
vividly
upon
his
memory
an
evil
voice
within
him
said
why
should
i
trouble
myself
about
those
who
have
so
me
and
robbed
me
of
my
good
name
yet
another
and
gentler
voice
answered
do
unto
others
as
you
would
that
they
should
do
unto
you
compressing
his
lips
resolutely
he
succeeded
in
writing
a
very
formal
letter
not
at
all
like
what
he
had
intended
but
the
main
thing
was
to
make
himself
clearly
understood
so
he
carefully
studied
every
word
before
putting
it
down
in
black
and
white
as
follows
mr
bright
this
is
to
inform
you
of
my
being
here
i
could
not
bear
to
be
suspected
of
dishonesty
when
i
knew
i
was
innocent
of
wrongdoing
so
i
left
this
is
to
inform
you
that
the
is
in
charge
of
my
friend
charles
wormwood
you
may
recollect
him
he
is
a
fine
young
man
between
us
we
got
hold
of
half
the
cargo
and
i
have
the
refusal
of
the
other
half
for
ninety
days
the
man
who
owns
it
has
gone
away
if
you
think
it
worth
while
send
directions
to
somebody
here
what
to
do
about
it
this
is
a
great
country
only
i
afraid
it
will
burn
up
all
the
time
your
true
friend
walter
seabury
while
on
his
way
uptown
to
post
his
letter
walter
heard
a
familiar
voice
call
out
hi
lookin
for
a
job
it
was
the
drayman
of
yesterday
adventure
placidly
kicking
his
heels
on
the
tail
of
his
dray
walter
candidly
admitted
that
he
would
like
something
to
do
the
drayman
spoke
up
briskly
good
enough
not
afraid
of
dirty
hands
no
good
again
got
some
no
cleaned
out
eh
so
was
i
say
there
a
handcart
stand
on
the
next
corner
above
here
i
had
my
eye
on
for
some
time
more
people
pass
there
in
a
day
than
any
other
in
talk
biz
that
comer
has
been
waiting
for
you
or
it
would
been
snapped
up
long
ago
no
job
less
than
six
bits
you
can
make
anywhere
from
five
to
ten
dollars
a
day
come
what
do
you
say
do
we
hitch
hosses
or
not
walter
had
a
short
struggle
with
his
pride
it
did
seem
rather
low
to
be
sure
to
be
pushing
a
handcart
through
the
streets
like
the
seen
at
home
but
beggars
should
not
be
choosers
he
reflected
so
putting
his
pride
in
his
pocket
the
bargain
was
closed
without
more
words
certainly
walter
best
friends
would
hardly
have
known
him
when
he
made
his
first
appearance
on
the
stand
bright
and
early
next
morning
rigged
out
in
a
gray
slouch
hat
red
woolen
shirt
and
blue
overalls
tucked
into
a
pair
of
stout
cowhide
boots
his
face
too
was
beginning
to
show
signs
of
quite
a
promising
beard
which
walter
was
often
seen
caressing
as
if
to
make
sure
it
was
still
there
overnight
and
which
indeed
so
greatly
altered
his
looks
that
he
now
felt
little
fear
of
being
recognized
by
ramon
should
they
happen
to
meet
some
day
unexpectedly
in
the
street
walter
ranched
with
his
employer
in
a
loft
with
a
hammer
a
saw
and
some
nails
he
had
soon
knocked
together
a
bunk
out
of
some
old
packing
boxes
in
this
he
slept
on
a
straw
mattress
also
of
his
own
make
with
a
pair
of
coarse
blankets
for
bedclothes
another
packing
box
a
water
pail
a
tin
towel
and
soap
comprised
all
necessary
conveniences
with
which
the
morning
toilet
was
soon
made
the
bed
required
no
making
rather
primitive
housekeeping
to
be
sure
yet
walter
soon
learned
from
actual
observation
that
a
majority
of
the
merchants
some
of
whom
were
reputed
worth
their
hundreds
of
thousands
were
no
better
lodged
than
himself
on
the
whole
walter
rather
liked
his
new
occupation
as
soon
as
his
first
awkwardness
had
worn
off
here
at
any
rate
he
was
his
own
master
and
walter
had
always
chafed
at
being
ordered
about
by
boys
no
older
than
himself
then
he
liked
the
hearty
democratic
way
in
which
everybody
greeted
everybody
it
made
things
move
along
much
more
cheerfully
walter
was
attentive
business
was
good
at
the
close
of
each
day
he
handed
over
his
earnings
to
his
employer
who
kept
his
own
share
punctually
returning
walter
the
rest
you
be
buyin
out
sam
brannan
one
of
these
days
if
you
keep
on
as
you
goin
was
furbish
encouraging
remark
as
he
figured
up
walter
earnings
at
dollars
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
who
sam
brannan
not
know
who
sam
brannan
is
asked
the
drayman
lifting
his
eyebrows
in
amazement
he
reputed
the
richest
man
in
owns
a
big
block
on
montgomery
street
income
two
thousand
a
day
they
tell
me
walter
could
only
gape
in
astonishment
the
bare
idea
of
any
one
man
possessing
such
wealth
was
something
that
he
had
never
dreamed
of
fact
repeated
the
drayman
observing
walter
look
of
incredulity
the
restaurant
at
which
walter
took
his
meals
until
circumstances
suggested
a
change
was
one
of
the
institutions
peculiar
to
the
san
francisco
of
that
day
an
old
dismantled
hulk
had
been
hauled
up
alongside
the
wharf
the
roofed
over
and
some
loose
boards
laid
upon
wooden
trestles
made
to
serve
the
purpose
of
a
table
while
the
ship
caboose
performed
its
customary
office
of
scullery
and
kitchen
the
restaurant
keeper
was
evidently
new
to
the
business
for
he
was
in
the
habit
of
urging
his
customers
to
have
a
second
helping
of
everything
much
to
the
annoyance
of
his
wife
who
did
the
cooking
this
woman
was
one
of
the
class
locally
known
as
sydney
ducks
from
the
fact
that
she
had
come
from
australia
under
the
sanction
of
a
she
was
fat
brawny
and
in
fact
fiery
and
when
out
of
sorts
gave
her
tongue
free
license
the
pair
were
continually
quarreling
at
regardless
of
the
presence
of
the
boarders
some
of
whom
took
a
malicious
pleasure
in
egging
on
the
one
or
the
other
when
words
failed
them
but
it
happened
more
than
once
that
when
words
failed
man
and
wife
began
shying
plates
or
cups
and
saucers
at
each
head
which
quickly
cleared
the
table
of
boarders
walter
stood
this
sort
of
thing
stoically
until
one
noon
when
he
was
just
entering
the
dining
room
a
came
whizzing
by
him
narrowly
missing
his
head
the
language
that
accompanied
it
showed
madam
to
be
mistress
of
the
choicest
billingsgate
in
profusion
by
the
time
a
second
sailed
through
the
door
walter
was
a
block
away
and
still
running
it
was
shrewdly
surmised
that
man
and
wife
had
broken
up
housekeeping
meanwhile
the
search
for
ramon
was
faithfully
kept
up
yet
so
far
with
no
better
success
than
if
the
ground
had
opened
and
swallowed
him
up
nobody
knew
a
person
of
the
name
of
ingersoll
no
doubt
he
had
assumed
another
less
incriminating
a
decoy
letter
dropped
in
the
remained
there
unclaimed
until
sent
to
the
office
fool
if
he
had
changed
his
name
muttered
bill
as
walter
and
he
stood
at
a
street
corner
looking
blankly
into
each
other
face
they
were
taking
their
customary
stroll
uptown
in
the
evening
when
the
big
bell
on
the
plaza
suddenly
clanged
out
an
alarm
of
fire
there
was
no
appearance
of
fire
anywhere
no
shooting
flames
no
smoke
no
red
glare
in
the
sky
yet
every
one
seemed
flocking
as
if
by
a
common
understanding
toward
the
chinese
quarter
catching
the
prevailing
excitement
the
three
friends
pressed
forward
with
the
crowd
which
at
every
step
was
visibly
increasing
upon
reaching
the
point
where
the
were
already
hard
at
work
the
crowd
grew
more
and
more
dense
shouts
and
cries
broke
out
here
and
there
lights
were
glancing
hither
and
thither
and
still
no
sign
of
fire
could
be
detected
what
could
it
all
mean
it
meant
that
by
a
secret
understanding
among
the
firemen
winked
at
by
the
city
authorities
the
fire
department
was
cleaning
out
the
chinese
quarter
which
had
become
an
intolerable
nuisance
dangerous
to
health
on
account
of
the
filthy
habits
of
the
celestials
the
fire
lads
were
only
too
willing
to
undertake
the
job
which
promised
to
be
such
a
fine
lark
and
at
the
first
tap
of
the
bells
they
had
rushed
their
machines
to
the
indicated
spot
run
their
hose
into
the
houses
and
regardless
of
the
screams
and
howlings
of
the
frightened
inmates
who
were
wildly
running
to
and
fro
in
frantic
efforts
to
escape
a
veritable
deluge
of
water
was
being
poured
upon
them
from
a
dozen
streams
fairly
washing
the
poor
devils
out
of
house
and
home
some
by
the
doors
some
by
leaping
out
of
the
windows
and
some
by
the
roofs
whenever
one
made
his
appearance
the
shouts
of
the
mob
would
direct
the
firemen
where
to
point
their
powerful
streams
which
quickly
sent
the
unresisting
victim
rolling
in
the
dirt
from
which
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
more
dead
than
alive
meantime
the
chinese
quarter
had
been
thoroughly
drenched
inside
and
out
the
terrified
inhabitants
scattered
in
every
direction
their
belongings
utterly
ruined
either
by
water
or
by
being
thrown
into
the
street
and
they
themselves
chased
and
hunted
from
pillar
to
post
like
so
many
rats
drowned
out
of
their
holes
by
an
inundation
until
the
last
victim
had
fled
beyond
the
reach
of
pursuit
when
the
whole
district
had
been
thus
depopulated
the
vast
throng
turned
homeward
in
great
good
humor
at
having
shown
those
miserable
barbarians
how
things
were
done
in
civilized
america
time
slipped
away
in
this
manner
and
gradually
the
edge
was
being
taken
off
from
the
keenness
of
the
search
though
never
completely
lost
sight
of
not
a
nook
or
corner
of
the
town
had
been
left
unvisited
and
still
no
ramon
it
was
even
as
walter
had
first
described
it
quite
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
one
morning
walter
was
called
to
help
furbish
move
some
goods
from
a
downtown
wharf
to
a
certain
warehouse
uptown
the
owner
was
found
standing
among
his
belongings
which
were
piled
and
tossed
about
in
a
state
of
angry
excitement
which
every
now
and
then
broke
forth
in
muttered
threats
and
snappy
monosyllables
directed
to
a
small
crowd
of
bystanders
who
had
been
attracted
to
the
spot
there
be
some
hanging
done
round
here
before
long
he
muttered
scowling
darkly
at
two
or
three
men
each
armed
with
a
brace
of
pistols
who
stood
with
their
backs
against
the
door
of
the
building
from
which
the
man
goods
had
been
so
hastily
thrown
out
this
building
stood
on
one
of
the
new
streets
spoken
of
in
a
former
chapter
as
built
out
over
the
water
or
on
what
was
then
known
as
a
it
seems
that
the
title
to
this
lot
was
claimed
by
two
parties
the
late
occupant
had
taken
a
lease
from
one
claimant
for
a
term
of
years
and
had
built
a
store
upon
the
lot
wholly
ignorant
that
another
party
claimed
it
he
had
punctually
paid
his
rent
to
his
landlord
every
month
and
was
therefore
dumfounded
when
late
one
afternoon
the
second
claimant
armed
with
an
order
of
a
certain
judge
and
accompanied
by
a
sheriff
posse
walked
into
his
store
and
after
demanding
payment
of
all
back
rents
which
was
stoutly
refused
promptly
ejected
the
unfortunate
tenant
neck
and
heels
from
his
place
of
business
his
goods
were
then
thrown
out
into
the
street
after
him
and
the
door
locked
against
him
with
an
armed
guard
keeping
possession
this
was
the
state
of
things
when
furbish
and
walter
arrived
on
the
ground
it
a
wicked
shame
declared
walter
indignantly
makes
business
good
for
us
was
furbish
careless
reply
then
lowering
his
voice
he
added
talk
low
and
keep
shady
mark
my
words
there
be
hanging
done
before
long
thus
unconsciously
echoing
the
very
words
of
the
dispossessed
tenant
walter
took
the
hint
he
stared
it
is
true
but
went
to
work
without
further
comment
though
he
could
see
that
the
sympathy
of
the
crowd
was
clearly
with
the
unfortunate
tenant
when
the
last
load
had
been
carted
away
the
crowd
slowly
dispersed
leaving
only
the
guards
on
the
spot
is
all
out
demanded
furbish
of
the
merchant
nodding
his
head
toward
the
empty
building
all
but
my
safe
i
want
that
bad
but
you
see
these
robbers
let
me
in
it
was
too
heavy
for
them
to
move
or
they
were
too
lazy
and
now
they
wo
even
let
me
take
my
papers
out
of
it
curse
them
got
the
key
oh
yes
that
all
safe
in
my
pocket
but
what
a
man
going
to
do
with
a
key
you
want
that
safe
bad
i
give
a
hundred
dollars
for
it
this
minute
yes
two
hundred
furbish
now
held
a
whispered
colloquy
with
walter
do
you
think
your
friends
would
take
a
hand
oh
i
answer
for
them
was
the
ready
reply
enough
said
a
place
of
meeting
was
then
fixed
upon
after
which
the
three
conspirators
went
their
several
ways
furbish
to
mature
his
plan
of
action
the
merchant
to
nurse
his
hopes
walter
to
enlist
his
two
friends
in
the
coming
adventure
charley
was
in
high
spirits
at
the
prospect
bill
thought
it
a
risky
piece
of
business
but
if
his
boys
were
going
to
take
a
hand
in
it
he
would
have
to
go
too
charley
put
an
end
to
further
argument
by
declaring
that
it
was
a
burning
shame
if
a
man
could
go
into
his
own
store
after
his
own
property
law
or
no
law
for
his
part
he
was
bound
to
see
the
thing
through
walter
stipulated
that
there
should
be
no
violence
used
and
that
he
should
not
be
asked
to
enter
the
building
if
it
was
found
to
be
still
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
men
just
at
midnight
a
with
an
empty
lighter
in
tow
put
off
from
the
side
care
being
taken
to
keep
in
the
deep
shadows
as
much
as
possible
not
a
word
was
exchanged
as
the
tow
was
quietly
brought
to
the
place
agreed
upon
where
it
lay
completely
hidden
from
curious
eyes
if
any
such
had
been
abroad
at
that
hour
as
the
lighter
lightly
grazed
the
wharf
a
dark
figure
stole
cautiously
out
from
the
shadow
cast
by
a
neighboring
warehouse
and
dropped
into
the
hands
stretched
out
to
receive
it
still
another
followed
and
the
party
now
complete
held
a
short
council
in
whispers
furbish
had
reconnoitered
the
store
finding
only
one
watchman
on
guard
outside
yet
he
was
positive
that
there
were
two
or
more
inside
as
he
had
seen
a
light
shining
through
a
crevice
in
the
which
suddenly
disappeared
while
he
was
watching
it
the
evicted
merchant
then
explained
that
this
light
must
have
come
from
the
little
office
at
the
right
hand
of
the
street
door
where
he
usually
slept
this
information
confirmed
the
belief
that
the
men
inside
had
turned
in
until
their
turn
should
come
to
relieve
the
guard
outside
if
this
should
prove
true
the
midnight
intruders
felt
that
they
would
have
a
more
easy
task
than
they
had
supposed
this
however
remained
to
be
seen
after
listening
to
a
minute
description
of
the
store
inside
and
out
furbish
gave
the
signal
to
proceed
making
the
boat
fast
to
the
scow
stern
the
latter
was
poled
along
in
the
shadows
of
the
wharves
until
under
bill
skillful
guidance
she
glided
between
the
two
piers
which
supported
the
building
that
the
party
was
in
search
of
all
listened
intently
for
any
sound
indicating
that
their
approach
had
been
detected
as
all
seemed
safe
the
scow
was
quickly
made
fast
directly
underneath
the
contrived
for
hoisting
up
merchandise
into
the
store
by
means
of
a
block
and
tackle
secured
to
a
stout
rafter
overhead
an
operation
at
which
charley
had
often
assisted
it
was
therefore
through
this
same
that
the
intruders
now
meant
to
effect
an
entrance
but
a
first
attempt
very
cautiously
made
to
raise
it
proved
it
to
be
bolted
on
the
inside
this
contingency
however
had
been
provided
against
for
charley
now
produced
a
large
auger
on
which
he
rubbed
some
tallow
to
deaden
the
sound
while
the
merchant
held
a
dark
lantern
in
such
a
way
as
to
show
charley
where
to
use
his
tool
to
advantage
very
cautiously
and
with
frequent
pauses
to
listen
a
large
hole
was
bored
next
to
the
place
where
the
bolt
shot
into
the
socket
two
or
three
minutes
were
occupied
in
this
work
charley
then
succeeded
in
drawing
back
the
bolt
with
his
fingers
a
little
at
a
time
when
the
trap
was
carefully
lifted
far
enough
to
let
the
merchant
squeeze
his
body
through
it
and
so
up
into
the
store
as
this
was
felt
to
be
the
critical
moment
those
who
were
left
below
listened
breathlessly
for
any
sound
from
above
as
the
trap
was
immediately
lowered
after
the
merchant
passed
through
it
it
was
of
course
in
the
store
but
knowing
the
way
as
well
in
the
dark
as
in
the
daytime
and
being
in
his
the
merchant
stood
only
a
moment
to
listen
out
of
the
darkness
the
sleeping
watchmen
could
be
heard
snoring
heavily
away
in
the
little
corner
office
groping
his
way
with
tread
the
merchant
with
two
or
three
quick
turns
of
the
wrist
screwed
a
gimlet
into
the
woodwork
of
the
office
door
over
the
latch
thus
securely
fastening
the
sleepers
in
observing
the
same
precautions
he
then
felt
for
the
lock
on
the
front
door
and
finding
the
key
in
the
lock
he
turned
it
softly
putting
the
key
in
his
pocket
even
should
they
awake
the
watchmen
inside
the
office
could
only
get
out
by
breaking
down
the
door
while
their
comrade
outside
would
be
kept
from
coming
to
their
assistance
the
merchant
had
certainly
shown
himself
not
only
to
be
a
man
of
nerve
but
no
mean
strategist
the
merchant
having
signaled
that
all
was
safe
all
the
rest
of
the
party
except
walter
immediately
joined
him
the
safe
was
speedily
located
some
loose
were
spread
upon
the
floor
to
deaden
the
sound
two
stout
slings
were
quickly
passed
around
the
safe
the
tackle
hooked
on
and
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
object
of
the
adventure
was
safely
lowered
into
the
lighter
no
time
was
lost
in
getting
the
scow
clear
of
her
dangerous
berth
nor
was
it
until
they
had
put
a
long
stretch
of
water
behind
them
that
the
adventurers
breathed
freely
the
daring
midnight
burglary
was
duly
chronicled
in
the
evening
papers
as
one
of
the
boldest
and
most
successful
known
to
the
criminal
annals
of
san
francisco
would
it
be
believed
it
was
asked
that
with
three
heavily
armed
guards
on
the
watch
inside
and
outside
of
the
building
the
burglars
had
actually
succeeded
in
carrying
off
so
bulky
an
article
as
an
iron
safe
under
the
very
noses
of
these
alleged
guardians
connivance
on
their
part
was
strongly
hinted
at
the
police
were
on
the
track
of
the
gang
who
did
the
job
and
the
public
might
rest
assured
that
when
caught
they
would
be
given
short
shrift
the
burglars
were
supposed
to
have
sunk
the
safe
in
the
harbor
after
rifling
it
of
its
contents
xiv
charley
and
walter
go
charley
frequently
came
ashore
in
the
evening
leaving
bill
in
charge
of
the
ship
walter
ranched
at
clark
point
near
the
waterside
and
only
a
few
steps
from
the
landing
place
the
neighborhood
to
tell
the
truth
did
not
bear
a
very
good
reputation
it
being
a
resort
for
sailors
of
all
nations
whose
nightly
carousals
in
the
low
dramshops
generally
kept
the
place
in
an
uproar
till
morning
and
often
ended
in
bloodshed
walter
was
busily
engaged
in
sewing
up
a
rip
in
his
overalls
meantime
humming
to
himself
snatches
of
the
old
folks
at
home
when
charley
came
stamping
into
the
room
seating
himself
on
an
empty
he
proceeded
to
free
his
mind
in
the
following
manner
you
been
working
pretty
steady
now
for
how
long
three
months
last
monday
assisted
walter
consulting
a
chalk
mark
on
the
wall
long
to
entitle
you
to
a
bit
of
a
vacation
i
what
say
to
takin
a
little
gunnin
trip
up
country
bill
knows
the
ropes
now
pretty
well
a
friend
of
mine
lend
me
the
fixin
could
you
get
off
for
a
few
days
think
come
get
that
ramon
chap
out
of
your
head
for
a
bit
it
wearin
on
you
walter
jumped
at
the
offer
thus
far
he
had
never
set
foot
out
of
the
city
and
charley
an
enthusiast
in
anything
that
he
had
set
his
mind
upon
now
portrayed
the
delights
of
a
tramp
among
the
foothills
of
the
coast
range
in
glowing
colors
walter
easily
found
a
substitute
for
the
few
days
he
expected
to
be
away
while
charley
had
permission
to
ask
so
the
very
next
afternoon
saw
the
two
sportsmen
crossing
the
ferry
to
contra
costa
charley
carrying
a
rifle
and
walter
a
shotgun
the
necessary
traps
for
camping
out
being
divided
equally
between
them
i
only
hope
we
may
set
eyes
on
a
grizzly
charley
remarked
slapping
the
breech
of
his
rifle
affectionately
as
they
stepped
on
shore
that
why
i
chose
this
feller
he
added
better
let
grizzlys
alone
from
all
i
hear
they
pretty
tough
customers
was
walter
cautious
comment
i
do
care
just
you
wait
till
i
see
one
that
all
i
all
fixed
for
him
lock
stock
and
barrel
they
soon
struck
into
the
road
leading
to
the
coast
range
and
after
steadily
tramping
until
dark
entered
a
small
settlement
where
travelers
coming
and
going
over
this
route
usually
put
up
for
the
night
a
night
lodging
was
soon
arranged
for
at
the
only
public
house
that
the
place
could
afford
and
after
eating
a
hearty
supper
and
leaving
word
with
the
landlord
to
call
them
up
as
soon
as
it
was
light
in
the
morning
the
two
amateur
hunters
were
glad
to
tumble
into
bed
the
house
was
a
frame
building
with
the
windows
in
front
opening
upon
a
veranda
after
the
southern
style
of
public
houses
the
air
being
hot
and
close
in
their
room
walter
threw
up
a
window
the
first
thing
upon
going
into
it
he
saw
that
one
might
easily
step
out
from
the
room
onto
the
veranda
or
in
for
that
matter
then
there
was
no
lock
on
the
door
but
as
neither
he
nor
charley
was
afraid
of
being
robbed
the
want
of
a
lock
did
not
prevent
their
going
to
sleep
as
soon
as
they
struck
their
beds
it
is
probable
that
they
did
not
even
turn
over
once
during
the
night
walter
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
a
gentle
scratching
or
tapping
at
the
door
upon
opening
his
eyes
he
perceived
that
it
was
beginning
to
be
quite
light
he
listened
until
the
sound
was
repeated
sat
up
in
bed
and
being
satisfied
that
it
must
be
some
one
calling
them
to
get
up
slipped
out
of
bed
yawning
and
stretching
himself
went
to
the
door
half
opened
it
and
still
only
half
awake
peered
out
what
he
saw
made
him
start
back
in
affright
and
his
hair
to
rise
up
on
his
head
in
an
instant
standing
erect
on
his
hind
feet
clumsily
beating
the
air
with
his
forepaws
and
lolling
out
a
long
red
tongue
was
an
enormous
shaggy
grizzly
bear
at
least
a
foot
taller
than
walter
himself
one
look
was
enough
giving
one
yell
walter
made
a
dash
for
the
open
window
leaped
out
upon
the
veranda
vaulted
over
it
and
grasping
firm
hold
of
the
railing
let
himself
drop
down
into
the
street
imagining
that
the
bear
was
close
behind
he
incontinently
took
to
his
heels
not
even
turning
to
look
back
over
his
shoulder
to
see
what
had
become
of
charley
startled
out
of
a
sound
sleep
by
walter
cry
of
alarm
charley
threw
off
the
bedclothes
rubbed
his
eyes
and
with
their
aid
saw
the
bear
waddling
with
rolling
gait
into
the
room
on
all
fours
he
too
made
a
dash
for
the
window
adopting
without
hesitation
the
only
route
of
escape
open
to
him
the
bear
quickly
followed
suit
sliding
with
ease
down
an
upright
and
on
touching
the
ground
immediately
set
off
after
the
fugitives
upon
whom
the
discovery
that
the
bear
was
after
them
acted
like
a
spur
upon
a
mettled
charger
they
no
longer
ran
they
flew
illustration
the
hunters
hunted
by
a
grizzly
up
to
this
hour
the
village
had
not
shaken
off
its
slumbers
but
the
frantic
shouts
of
the
fugitives
who
saw
that
the
faster
they
ran
the
faster
ran
the
bear
quickly
aroused
other
sleepers
from
their
morning
nap
dogs
began
to
bark
and
give
chase
to
the
bear
windows
began
to
be
thrown
up
and
heads
to
appear
at
them
still
the
race
for
life
continued
bruin
was
evidently
gaining
upon
the
fugitives
who
could
not
much
longer
keep
up
the
pace
at
which
they
were
going
feeling
his
breath
failing
him
charley
who
was
a
few
rods
behind
walter
had
even
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
stop
short
in
his
tracks
face
about
and
let
the
bear
work
its
will
upon
him
so
giving
his
bosom
friend
a
chance
to
escape
fortunately
however
this
heroic
was
not
to
be
made
at
the
last
house
a
street
door
was
seen
very
cautiously
to
open
while
a
head
protruded
from
it
ceremony
here
was
quite
out
of
the
question
walter
instantly
dashed
into
this
welcome
haven
of
refuge
with
charley
now
quite
spent
at
his
heels
overturning
the
man
of
the
house
in
their
mad
rush
for
safety
it
took
but
a
moment
to
shut
and
bolt
the
door
and
as
if
that
was
not
enough
walter
braced
his
back
against
it
panting
and
breathless
only
when
this
was
done
did
the
two
friends
draw
a
free
breath
both
were
completely
done
up
excited
by
the
chase
enraged
at
seeing
his
victims
escaping
the
bear
snuffed
the
air
pawed
at
the
door
swayed
his
huge
bulk
to
and
fro
and
gave
vent
to
his
rage
in
loud
and
unearthly
roarings
that
could
be
heard
by
every
inhabitant
of
the
village
meantime
the
man
into
whose
premises
the
two
young
men
had
so
unceremoniously
entered
after
taking
a
good
look
at
the
bear
out
of
the
window
almost
bent
double
in
the
effort
to
control
his
laughter
why
boys
said
he
between
fits
of
choking
that
jem
tame
grizzly
he
had
recognized
the
animal
now
holding
them
besieged
as
one
that
had
been
taken
when
a
cub
and
brought
up
by
the
landlord
of
the
public
house
from
which
the
boys
had
made
their
sudden
exit
as
an
object
of
curiosity
to
his
guests
the
iron
collar
which
bruin
still
wore
confirmed
this
account
it
was
all
plain
enough
now
having
contrived
to
free
himself
from
his
chain
the
bear
had
easily
gained
access
to
the
house
by
climbing
up
the
veranda
he
was
considered
quite
harmless
the
man
explained
but
on
seeing
the
young
men
run
away
the
bear
had
run
after
them
at
first
out
of
mere
playfulness
so
walter
and
charley
had
been
running
a
race
with
a
tame
grizzly
through
the
public
street
of
the
village
in
broad
daylight
in
their
night
clothes
by
this
time
something
of
a
crowd
had
collected
all
tongues
going
at
once
the
laugh
of
course
went
against
the
boys
though
some
were
in
favor
of
shooting
the
bear
and
so
putting
an
end
to
his
wild
pranks
his
master
however
who
now
came
forward
with
a
pitchfork
in
one
hand
and
an
earthenware
dish
containing
a
stiff
mixture
of
whisky
and
honey
in
the
other
objected
to
having
the
bear
killed
although
the
creature
was
now
so
ferocious
that
no
one
dared
to
go
near
him
setting
the
dish
down
upon
the
ground
and
silently
waving
the
crowd
back
the
man
began
calling
the
bear
by
his
pet
name
of
rusty
in
a
coaxing
tone
and
presently
bruin
having
scented
the
seductive
mixture
marched
toward
it
and
began
lapping
it
up
occasionally
emitting
a
fierce
growl
by
way
of
notifying
the
bystanders
to
keep
their
distance
by
the
time
the
dish
was
licked
clean
bruin
was
and
rolling
helplessly
in
the
dirt
his
chain
was
then
securely
fastened
on
and
the
brute
ignominiously
dragged
off
to
the
stable
to
sleep
off
his
potations
walter
and
charley
were
compelled
to
borrow
a
pair
of
trousers
apiece
before
they
could
venture
back
to
the
public
house
the
observed
of
all
observers
needless
to
say
they
made
all
haste
to
leave
the
inhospitable
spot
upon
calling
for
their
bill
the
landlord
declared
there
was
nothing
to
pay
and
with
a
straight
face
politely
hoped
they
would
recommend
his
house
to
their
friends
walter
insisted
upon
paying
but
the
landlord
was
firm
the
fame
of
the
hunt
would
attract
customers
to
his
house
he
said
under
the
circumstances
he
could
not
think
of
making
any
charge
whatever
when
they
were
well
out
of
the
village
charley
who
had
maintained
a
dogged
silence
suddenly
turned
to
walter
and
exclaimed
i
wo
tell
if
you
wo
do
be
a
ninny
was
the
curt
reply
if
i
only
had
my
rifle
muttered
charley
who
all
the
same
could
not
forbear
looking
backward
every
few
minutes
as
they
trudged
on
the
disconsolate
pair
made
their
way
up
among
the
foothills
but
neither
seemed
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
keen
sportsmen
or
else
game
was
not
so
plenty
as
they
had
expected
to
find
it
after
charley
had
blown
the
nipple
out
of
his
rifle
in
firing
at
a
coyote
and
walter
had
shot
half
a
dozen
rabbits
which
though
wounded
succeeded
in
reaching
their
holes
and
crawling
into
them
the
twain
willingly
turned
their
faces
homeward
footsore
and
weary
but
with
appetites
sharpened
by
their
long
tramp
they
were
only
too
glad
to
set
foot
once
again
in
the
streets
of
the
city
with
a
brief
so
long
charley
so
long
walt
mum
you
know
hope
to
die
they
separated
to
go
their
respective
ways
xv
the
young
vigilantes
while
on
his
way
to
work
on
saturday
morning
full
of
his
own
thoughts
walter
could
not
help
noticing
the
absence
of
the
usual
bustle
and
movement
in
the
streets
if
the
shops
had
not
been
open
he
would
have
thought
it
was
sunday
instead
of
the
last
day
of
the
week
all
business
seemed
to
be
at
a
standstill
merchants
stood
outside
their
doors
glancing
uneasily
up
and
down
the
street
and
from
time
to
time
holding
whispered
talks
with
their
neighbors
every
one
wore
a
sober
face
every
one
seemed
expecting
something
to
happen
but
what
was
it
what
could
it
be
yesterday
walter
would
have
passed
along
the
same
streets
hardly
noticed
he
wondered
why
everybody
stared
at
him
so
furbish
was
about
starting
off
on
his
dray
when
walter
reached
the
stand
he
too
hardly
replied
when
walter
gave
him
the
customary
what
could
it
all
mean
suddenly
the
big
bell
on
the
plaza
thundered
out
three
heavy
strokes
one
two
three
and
no
more
boom
boom
boom
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
walter
never
forgot
the
sight
that
followed
at
the
first
stroke
of
that
bell
the
strange
quiet
burst
its
bounds
those
already
in
the
streets
started
off
on
the
run
for
the
plaza
those
who
were
indoors
rushed
out
buckling
on
their
weapons
as
they
ran
workmen
threw
down
their
tools
to
join
in
the
race
furbish
jumped
off
his
dray
shouting
to
walter
as
he
ran
come
on
do
you
hear
it
there
was
no
noise
except
the
trampling
of
feet
nobody
asked
a
question
of
his
neighbor
but
every
eye
wore
a
look
of
grim
determination
as
if
some
matter
of
life
and
death
dwelt
in
the
imperious
summons
of
that
loud
after
gazing
a
moment
in
utter
bewilderment
walter
started
off
on
the
run
with
the
rest
he
too
had
caught
the
infection
the
distance
was
nothing
he
found
the
plaza
already
black
with
people
beyond
him
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
he
saw
a
glittering
line
of
bayonets
nearer
at
hand
men
were
pouring
out
of
a
building
at
the
right
with
muskets
in
their
hands
walter
stood
on
tiptoe
some
one
was
speaking
to
the
crowd
from
an
open
window
fronting
the
plaza
but
walter
was
too
far
off
to
catch
a
single
word
the
vast
throng
was
as
still
as
death
then
as
the
speaker
put
some
question
to
vote
one
tremendous
aye
went
up
from
a
thousand
throats
it
was
the
voice
of
an
outraged
people
pronouncing
the
doom
of
by
the
gleam
of
satisfaction
on
the
faces
around
him
walter
knew
that
something
of
unusual
moment
had
just
been
decided
upon
burning
with
curiosity
he
timidly
asked
his
nearest
neighbor
what
it
all
meant
first
giving
him
a
blank
look
the
man
addressed
curtly
replied
get
a
morning
paper
then
moved
off
with
the
crowd
which
was
already
dispersing
leaving
the
plaza
in
quiet
possession
of
a
body
of
citizen
soldiers
with
sentinels
posted
and
the
strong
arm
of
a
new
power
uplifted
in
its
might
that
power
was
the
dreaded
vigilantes
organized
armed
and
ready
for
the
common
protection
though
terribly
in
earnest
it
was
by
far
the
most
orderly
multitude
walter
remembered
ever
having
seen
and
he
had
seen
many
in
the
newspaper
he
read
what
everybody
else
already
knew
that
one
of
the
most
prominent
citizens
had
been
brutally
murdered
in
cold
blood
by
a
gambler
in
a
crowded
street
and
at
an
early
hour
of
the
previous
evening
the
victim
only
provocation
consisted
in
having
spoken
out
like
a
man
against
the
monstrous
evils
under
which
the
citizens
had
so
long
and
so
silently
been
groaning
this
murder
was
the
last
straw
the
murderer
had
been
promptly
taken
by
members
of
the
secret
committee
of
vigilance
the
trial
had
been
swift
and
the
hangman
noose
was
being
made
ready
for
its
victim
the
account
closed
with
a
burning
appeal
to
all
citizens
at
every
cost
to
rid
the
city
of
the
whole
gang
of
gamblers
thieves
and
outlaws
infesting
it
like
a
plague
when
the
sworn
officers
of
the
law
are
so
notoriously
in
league
with
such
miscreants
nothing
is
left
for
the
people
but
to
rise
in
their
might
populi
vox
dei
down
with
the
hounds
charley
and
bill
were
quietly
eating
their
noonday
meal
when
walter
burst
into
the
cabin
in
a
state
of
wild
excitement
without
stopping
to
take
breath
he
rapidly
related
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
that
morning
while
his
listeners
sat
with
eyes
until
the
tale
was
finished
for
a
few
moments
the
three
friends
stared
at
each
other
in
silence
ever
prompt
charley
was
the
first
to
break
it
jumping
to
his
feet
he
struck
the
haft
of
his
knife
on
the
table
with
such
force
as
to
set
the
dishes
rattling
then
waving
it
in
the
air
he
cried
out
exultingly
now
we
got
him
as
the
others
made
no
reply
except
to
look
askance
he
went
on
to
say
do
you
see
that
foxy
as
he
is
ramon
will
be
smoked
out
of
his
hole
did
i
tell
you
there
would
be
hanging
before
long
why
there
wo
be
one
of
his
kidney
left
in
inside
of
a
week
you
right
said
walter
for
as
i
came
along
i
saw
men
putting
up
posters
ordering
all
criminals
out
of
the
city
on
pain
of
being
put
on
board
an
outbound
vessel
and
shipped
off
out
of
the
country
good
enough
for
too
the
heft
of
is
sydney
ducks
men
anyhow
quoth
bill
with
a
shake
of
the
head
hark
commanded
walter
holding
up
his
hand
for
silence
even
as
he
spoke
the
deep
tones
of
a
bell
came
booming
across
the
water
at
that
moment
the
bodies
of
two
condemned
murderers
were
swinging
from
crossbeams
from
an
upper
window
of
the
plaza
if
we
ever
going
to
catch
that
chap
we
better
set
about
it
before
it
too
late
what
to
hinder
our
working
this
vigilante
business
a
little
on
our
own
hook
nothing
who
going
to
ask
any
questions
nobody
do
you
catch
my
idee
questioned
charley
without
more
words
the
three
friends
hastened
on
shore
walter
leading
the
way
to
his
stand
they
had
agreed
not
to
separate
again
and
were
busy
talking
over
their
plans
when
a
chinaman
came
up
to
walter
and
slipped
a
paper
in
his
hand
walter
ran
his
eye
over
it
then
crushed
it
in
his
hand
turning
to
the
chinaman
he
simply
said
all
right
john
i
be
there
allee
light
repeated
the
chinaman
making
off
into
the
crowd
walter
drew
the
heads
of
his
two
friends
close
to
his
own
then
he
whispered
what
do
you
think
this
is
an
order
to
take
some
things
from
a
certain
house
on
dupont
street
to
a
warehouse
on
long
wharf
at
ten
night
work
double
pay
i
ca
be
mistaken
the
order
is
in
handwriting
i
could
swear
to
it
i
consait
we
orter
follow
the
chinee
bill
suggested
tentatively
no
objected
charley
he
lead
us
a
chase
all
over
town
if
walter
right
we
hot
on
the
scent
now
do
muddy
the
water
i
say
the
eel
a
slippery
cuss
and
might
wiggle
away
bill
let
you
and
i
go
take
a
look
at
that
warehouse
walt
you
let
on
that
you
suspicion
a
thing
why
you
all
of
a
tremble
man
straighten
out
your
face
anybody
could
read
it
like
a
book
pull
yourself
together
look
at
me
by
jings
i
feel
like
a
just
now
what
a
bantam
muttered
bill
following
in
charley
springing
footsteps
at
ten
walter
was
at
the
door
of
the
house
on
dupont
street
with
his
cart
his
knock
was
answered
by
the
same
chinaman
who
had
brought
him
the
note
in
the
morning
several
parcels
were
brought
out
and
placed
in
the
cart
but
still
no
sign
of
the
owner
the
chinaman
then
explained
in
his
pigeon
english
that
this
person
would
meet
walter
at
the
warehouse
on
the
wharf
for
which
place
walter
immediately
started
revolving
in
his
own
mind
whether
this
was
not
some
trick
of
ramon
contriving
to
throw
him
walter
off
the
scent
nobody
appeared
to
answer
walter
knock
at
the
warehouse
door
evidently
it
was
deserted
but
a
low
whistle
gave
notice
that
charley
and
bill
were
close
at
hand
indeed
so
well
had
they
concealed
themselves
that
walter
had
passed
on
without
seeing
them
have
you
got
the
rope
all
right
bill
walter
nervously
whispered
as
the
three
crouched
in
the
friendly
shadow
of
a
narrow
passageway
while
waiting
for
their
victim
to
show
himself
sartin
that
worthy
calmly
replied
and
all
i
wish
is
that
was
on
one
end
and
i
on
i
do
half
like
this
way
of
doing
things
looks
too
much
like
kidnapping
walter
whispered
half
to
himself
come
walt
you
not
going
to
show
the
white
feather
now
after
all
this
trouble
i
hope
charley
impatiently
said
ssh
here
he
comes
it
now
or
never
sure
enough
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
was
now
plainly
heard
as
ramon
came
nearer
walking
fast
bill
stepping
out
of
the
shadows
slowly
lurched
along
ahead
cleverly
imitating
the
zigzag
walk
of
a
tipsy
sailor
no
unusual
sight
at
that
time
of
night
when
ramon
had
passed
a
few
rods
beyond
their
hiding
place
charley
quietly
slipped
out
behind
him
taking
care
to
tread
as
softly
as
one
of
indians
on
the
warpath
this
plan
had
been
carefully
devised
for
fear
that
ramon
might
give
an
alarm
if
they
attempted
all
at
once
to
rush
out
upon
him
unawares
they
now
held
their
intended
victim
as
it
were
between
two
fires
at
that
hour
the
street
was
so
lonely
and
deserted
that
there
was
little
fear
of
interruption
so
charley
did
not
hurry
when
bill
had
reached
the
place
agreed
upon
where
the
street
narrowed
to
a
lane
in
which
not
more
than
two
persons
could
walk
abreast
he
began
to
slacken
his
pace
so
as
to
let
ramon
come
up
with
him
as
nothing
could
be
seen
at
a
few
rods
off
in
that
uncertain
light
the
signal
agreed
upon
was
to
be
given
by
bill
striking
a
match
when
walter
and
charley
were
to
come
up
as
rapidly
as
possible
as
ramon
tried
to
push
on
by
bill
that
worthy
placed
himself
squarely
in
the
way
pulled
out
his
pipe
and
gruffly
demanded
a
light
he
acted
his
part
so
well
as
completely
to
disarm
ramon
suspicions
had
he
had
any
at
being
thus
suddenly
brought
to
a
stand
ramon
attempted
to
shoulder
bill
out
of
his
path
but
on
finding
himself
stoutly
opposed
he
instinctively
drew
back
a
step
refuse
a
a
light
does
yer
want
a
whole
street
to
yourself
does
yer
sputtered
bill
obstinately
holding
his
ground
ramon
made
a
threatening
movement
shove
i
dare
ye
ye
lubber
continued
the
irate
sailor
purposely
raising
his
voice
as
his
companion
came
in
sight
i
a
match
for
you
any
day
in
the
week
he
grumbled
striking
a
light
as
if
to
enforce
the
challenge
by
the
light
of
the
match
bill
instantly
recognized
ramon
at
the
same
moment
ramon
saw
that
the
speaker
was
a
total
stranger
charley
barred
the
way
behind
him
ramon
first
thought
had
been
that
he
was
being
waylaid
by
footpads
and
instinctively
his
hand
went
to
his
pistol
but
as
no
demand
was
made
for
his
valuables
he
quickly
concluded
it
to
be
a
chance
encounter
with
a
couple
of
tipsy
sailors
a
street
row
was
the
very
thing
he
most
dreaded
he
was
in
a
fever
to
be
off
then
the
thought
struck
him
that
perhaps
he
might
turn
these
fellows
to
his
own
advantage
so
he
altered
his
tone
at
once
oh
it
all
right
lads
he
said
apologetically
but
one
must
be
careful
in
these
times
you
know
and
you
certainly
did
give
me
a
start
never
mind
if
you
got
a
boat
handy
i
make
this
the
best
night
work
you
ever
did
in
the
whole
course
of
your
lives
charley
who
had
edged
up
closer
now
nudged
bill
to
hold
his
tongue
speaking
thickly
charley
said
if
you
wants
a
boat
we
got
the
one
we
was
just
goin
off
in
aboard
ship
she
lays
right
here
just
ahead
of
us
if
you
come
down
we
the
lads
you
want
said
ramon
was
completely
deceived
all
right
then
i
got
some
traps
yonder
they
waiting
for
me
i
see
we
get
them
and
you
can
set
me
aboard
the
hurry
up
i
no
time
to
lose
walter
was
nonplused
when
he
saw
the
trio
approaching
in
so
friendly
a
manner
he
was
about
to
say
something
when
charley
trod
sharply
on
his
foot
to
enforce
silence
all
four
then
went
down
to
the
boat
with
ramon
luggage
after
handing
walter
a
gold
piece
ramon
stepped
lightly
into
the
boat
bill
shipped
the
oars
and
charley
took
the
tiller
walter
first
cast
off
the
painter
gave
the
boat
a
vigorous
shove
and
then
leaped
on
board
himself
he
could
not
make
out
what
had
happened
to
change
their
plans
but
this
was
no
time
for
explanations
seeing
the
supposed
cartman
get
into
the
boat
it
then
first
flashed
upon
ramon
that
he
had
been
tricked
half
rising
from
his
seat
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
leap
overboard
but
a
big
bony
hand
dragged
him
backward
maddened
to
desperation
ramon
then
reached
for
his
revolver
but
before
he
could
draw
it
walter
threw
his
arms
around
him
and
held
him
fast
in
spite
of
his
struggles
meantime
bill
was
taking
two
or
three
turns
round
ramon
body
with
a
stout
rope
brought
along
for
that
very
purpose
and
in
a
twinkling
that
worthy
found
himself
bound
and
helpless
no
word
was
spoken
until
the
boat
touched
the
side
thoroughly
cowed
shivering
with
cold
and
fright
ramon
terror
was
heightened
by
the
thought
that
he
was
being
carried
off
to
sea
as
the
black
hull
of
the
loomed
up
before
him
the
dreadful
truth
seemed
to
break
upon
him
clearly
yes
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
he
was
being
shanghaied
as
the
forcible
kidnaping
of
sailors
was
called
charley
went
up
the
side
first
in
a
minute
he
reappeared
with
a
lighted
lantern
a
dull
numbness
had
seized
ramon
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
cry
out
when
charley
called
to
the
others
in
a
guarded
undertone
to
pass
him
along
four
stout
arms
then
lifted
or
rather
boosted
ramon
on
board
the
vessel
as
limp
and
helpless
as
a
dead
man
i
knew
it
he
groaned
with
chattering
teeth
shanghaied
by
all
that
horrible
xvi
ramon
finds
his
match
charley
at
once
led
the
way
into
the
cabin
when
all
four
had
passed
in
he
shut
the
door
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
set
down
the
lantern
on
the
table
when
by
its
dim
light
ramon
saw
for
the
first
time
the
faces
of
his
abductors
stealing
a
quick
glance
around
him
he
met
walter
set
face
and
stern
eye
the
faces
of
the
others
gave
him
as
little
encouragement
greatly
relieved
to
find
his
worst
fears
unfounded
his
courage
began
to
rise
again
he
met
walter
look
with
one
of
defiance
and
inwardly
resolved
to
brazen
it
out
his
life
he
knew
was
safe
enough
to
show
that
he
was
not
afraid
he
assumed
a
careless
tone
as
if
he
looked
upon
the
whole
thing
as
a
joke
you
got
me
boys
but
now
you
got
me
what
do
you
want
with
me
he
demanded
twisting
a
cigarette
in
his
trembling
fingers
first
said
walter
a
trifle
unsteadily
for
the
sight
of
his
enemy
was
almost
too
much
for
him
first
we
want
you
to
sign
this
paper
taking
it
out
of
his
pocket
it
is
you
can
read
it
a
full
confession
of
your
robbery
of
bright
company
in
spite
of
his
effrontery
ramon
could
not
help
wincing
a
little
walter
went
on
without
mercy
and
of
your
clever
little
scheme
to
throw
suspicion
on
me
as
your
accomplice
ramon
merely
gave
a
contemptuous
little
shrug
and
lastly
of
what
you
done
with
all
the
property
you
you
stole
ramon
scowled
and
gnawed
his
mustache
now
that
he
knew
the
worst
ramon
began
to
bluster
oh
you
shall
smart
for
this
when
i
get
on
shore
yes
all
of
you
he
declared
hotly
you
got
the
wrong
pig
by
the
ear
this
time
yes
you
have
as
for
you
this
to
bill
you
old
villain
i
have
you
skinned
alive
and
hung
up
by
the
heels
for
a
scarecrow
bill
could
hold
in
no
longer
who
said
anything
about
your
ashore
i
like
to
know
he
asked
in
his
bantering
way
you
never
be
missed
nohow
here
yer
be
and
here
you
stop
till
done
with
you
so
none
of
your
black
looks
nor
cheap
talk
they
pass
here
stop
me
if
you
dare
it
abduction
kidnaping
felony
cried
ramon
glancing
fiercely
from
one
face
to
the
other
i
despise
you
and
your
threats
where
are
your
proofs
where
is
your
authority
ugly
words
those
big
words
you
want
proofs
eh
what
do
you
say
to
this
walter
asked
in
his
turn
unfolding
a
handbill
before
eyes
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
held
the
lantern
up
so
that
the
accusing
words
in
staring
print
might
be
the
more
easily
read
stop
thief
reward
the
above
reward
will
be
paid
for
the
apprehension
of
one
ramon
ingersoll
an
absconding
embezzler
this
was
followed
by
a
detailed
description
of
his
personal
appearance
now
will
you
sign
walter
again
demanded
of
the
branded
thief
and
fugitive
from
justice
ramon
smiled
a
sickly
smile
oh
it
the
reward
you
after
is
it
hope
you
may
get
it
that
all
at
this
fresh
insult
two
red
spots
flamed
up
on
walter
cheeks
ramon
dark
eyes
sparkled
at
having
so
cleverly
seen
through
the
motives
of
his
captors
is
that
your
last
word
before
i
sign
that
paper
i
rot
right
here
you
had
better
sleep
on
it
replied
walter
turning
away
what
before
him
for
the
stealin
bill
asked
with
surprise
at
the
same
time
critically
looking
ramon
over
from
head
to
foot
ramon
hand
went
to
his
neckcloth
as
if
already
he
felt
the
hangman
noose
choking
him
the
observant
bill
meanwhile
watching
him
as
a
cat
does
a
mouse
come
my
lad
turn
out
your
pockets
he
commanded
in
a
most
way
pale
with
anger
ramon
first
pulled
out
a
leather
which
he
threw
upon
the
table
with
something
that
sounded
very
much
like
a
muttered
curse
after
which
he
folded
his
arms
defiantly
across
his
chest
now
you
got
it
much
good
may
it
do
you
he
sneered
the
contained
only
a
few
papers
of
little
value
to
anybody
what
has
become
of
all
the
money
you
took
walter
demanded
gone
was
the
curt
reply
what
gone
you
ca
have
spent
it
all
so
soon
think
again
there
must
be
a
trifle
left
ramon
shrugged
his
shoulders
by
way
of
reply
feel
for
his
belt
bill
charley
struck
in
charley
had
been
growing
impatient
for
some
time
over
so
much
waste
of
words
bill
hastened
to
take
the
hint
hands
off
i
tell
you
i
not
be
searched
shouted
ramon
carrying
his
hands
to
the
threatened
spot
like
a
flash
in
spite
of
his
struggles
however
the
belt
which
every
one
wore
in
that
day
was
secured
and
in
it
ten
new
gold
pieces
were
found
and
turned
out
upon
the
table
again
ramon
hand
went
to
his
neckcloth
nervously
tremblingly
in
a
twinkling
bill
had
twitched
that
article
off
and
tossed
it
to
walter
good
a
belt
hai
it
asked
bill
in
answer
to
walter
look
i
seed
him
grabbin
at
it
twicet
it
it
illustration
ramon
made
to
give
up
his
rolled
up
in
a
little
wad
in
the
folds
of
the
neckerchief
they
found
two
certificates
of
deposit
of
a
thousand
dollars
each
and
in
another
similar
roll
several
notes
of
hand
for
quite
large
sums
made
payable
to
bright
company
but
with
forged
indorsements
to
a
third
party
who
it
is
needless
to
say
was
no
other
than
ramon
himself
who
had
thus
added
forgery
to
his
catalogue
of
crime
fortunately
his
hurried
departure
had
prevented
the
negotiating
of
these
notes
which
now
furnished
the
most
damning
evidence
of
his
misdeeds
now
then
said
walter
sweeping
the
money
and
papers
together
in
a
heap
we
drawn
his
teeth
let
him
bite
if
he
can
at
this
cutting
taunt
ramon
summoned
to
his
aid
the
remains
of
his
assurance
oho
my
fine
gentlemen
suppose
i
all
you
say
i
am
if
you
take
my
money
you
as
deep
in
the
mud
as
i
am
in
the
mire
eh
my
gallant
highwaymen
he
hissed
out
enough
of
this
we
shall
take
good
care
of
you
but
we
mean
to
hand
you
over
to
the
vigilantes
you
can
then
plead
your
own
cause
master
embezzler
so
saying
walter
pointed
to
a
stateroom
opposite
to
signify
that
the
last
word
had
been
said
ramon
face
instantly
turned
of
a
sickly
pallor
as
bill
afterwards
said
walter
threat
took
all
the
starch
out
of
him
in
a
broken
voice
he
now
pleaded
for
mercy
i
give
it
up
i
confess
i
sign
all
you
say
anything
if
you
promise
not
to
give
me
up
to
those
bloodhounds
he
almost
whimpered
truly
his
craven
spirit
had
at
last
got
the
mastery
walter
pretended
to
hesitate
but
in
truth
he
was
only
turning
over
in
his
own
mind
how
best
to
dispose
of
ramon
hitherto
the
wish
for
revenge
had
been
strong
within
him
had
really
gone
with
that
to
see
wrong
made
right
but
ramon
was
now
only
an
object
of
pity
of
contempt
the
confession
was
again
placed
before
him
with
the
addition
of
a
clause
stating
that
the
money
surrendered
was
the
same
he
had
taken
from
his
employers
he
himself
added
the
words
this
is
my
free
act
and
deed
after
which
he
signed
his
full
name
as
if
in
a
hurry
to
have
it
over
with
the
two
friends
then
witnessed
it
walter
put
this
precious
document
in
his
pocket
with
a
feeling
of
real
triumph
at
last
his
good
name
would
be
vindicated
before
all
the
world
once
again
he
could
look
any
man
in
the
face
without
a
blush
it
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
yet
there
sat
ramon
cowering
in
a
corner
while
he
walter
held
the
damning
proofs
of
the
robbery
in
his
possession
no
it
was
not
a
dream
right
was
might
after
all
instead
of
asking
to
be
set
at
liberty
ramon
now
begged
to
be
kept
hid
from
the
dreaded
vigilantes
give
me
just
money
enough
to
get
away
with
set
me
on
shore
after
dark
and
i
take
my
chances
he
pleaded
only
too
glad
to
be
well
rid
of
him
the
three
friends
willingly
agreed
to
this
proposal
after
darkness
had
set
in
bill
pulled
ramon
to
a
distant
spot
above
the
town
among
the
sand
dunes
handing
the
discomfited
wretch
his
own
with
the
contents
untouched
bill
gave
him
this
parting
shot
take
it
and
go
to
guinea
if
this
is
the
last
on
ye
well
an
good
but
it
my
there
more
rascality
stowed
away
in
that
cowardly
carkiss
o
yourn
without
replying
ramon
stole
away
in
the
darkness
and
was
soon
lost
to
sight
xvii
a
sharp
rise
in
lumber
is
that
the
sacramento
boat
asked
charley
looking
off
in
the
direction
of
a
rapidly
approaching
bank
of
lights
how
plainly
we
can
hear
the
drumming
of
her
big
paddles
listen
if
it
is
she
all
of
two
hours
ahead
of
time
was
walter
reply
yes
it
the
old
day
she
a
traveler
all
the
time
and
she
has
the
tide
with
her
do
you
know
they
say
she
made
more
money
for
her
owners
than
she
could
carry
on
one
trip
sho
you
do
mean
it
true
as
you
stand
there
they
stood
watching
the
work
her
way
into
her
dock
when
charley
suddenly
asked
what
are
you
so
glum
about
walt
i
was
thinking
what
i
would
do
if
i
had
a
boatload
of
money
hope
you
may
get
it
that
all
hark
ah
here
bill
back
again
by
the
way
that
bill
was
rowing
he
seemed
in
a
great
hurry
greatly
to
the
surprise
of
the
two
friends
he
was
closely
followed
up
the
side
by
a
stranger
to
whom
bill
lent
a
helping
hand
as
this
person
stumbled
awkwardly
to
the
deck
at
first
both
walter
and
charley
thought
it
must
be
ramon
returning
hello
what
up
now
both
exclaimed
in
one
breath
what
up
lumber
up
got
any
answered
a
quick
sharp
voice
not
at
all
like
ramon
as
nobody
spoke
bill
made
a
hurried
explanation
sacramento
all
burnt
up
lock
stock
and
barrel

i

i
jest
mittened
onto
him
and
here
he
is
whar

or

the
newcomer
impatiently
demanded

charley
replied
good
enough

stowed

can
be
got
at
it
a
whole
cargo

been
broken
out

cabin

the

impatiently

walter
put

very
man

i
bound
to
go
back
on
that
thar
boat
thus
urged
walter
began
the
inventory
on
his
fingers
there
six
dwelling
houses
all
framed
ready
to
go
up
how
big
about
pitched
roof
luthern
windows
the
rest
is
building
stuff
all
of
it
sills

impatient
man
broke
in
yes
a
big
lot
and
clapboards
too
talk
enough
whar
the
owner
you
talking
to
him
now
said
charley
quickly
well
then
i
we
better
have
a
little
light
on
the
subject
had
we
the
stranger
suggested
upon
this
hint
charley
led
the
way
to
the
cabin
where
the
parties
took
a
good
look
at
each
other
the
stranger
glanced
over
the
manifest
laid
a
big
brawny
hand
upon
it
then
turning
to
walter
but
without
betraying
surprise
at
his
youthful
appearance
said
pointedly
name
your
price
cash
down
stranger
for
the
lot
here
for
a
dicker
walter
began
a
rapid
mental
calculation
those
houses
are
worth
all
of
hundred
apiece
he
declared
glancing
at
charley
more
charley
assented
positively
wuth
more
for
firewood
added
bill
houses
and
all
all
or
none
how
much
for
the
hull
blamed
cargo
the
stranger
again
demanded
getting
up
to
expectorate
in
a
corner
lumber
is
lumber
observed
charley
wrinkling
his
forehead
in
deep
thought
do
i
ask
you
to
give
it
away
name
your
figure
the
purchaser
insisted
come
up
to
the
scratch
i
no
time
to
waste
here
palavering
what
do
you
take
me
for
he
added
angrily
walter
again
had
recourse
to
his
mental
arithmetic
six
times
two
fifty
fifteen
lump
the
rest
at
ten
freight
money
five
storage
five
more
insurance
five
forty
thousand
dollars
he
exclaimed
desperately
at
a
venture
feeling
the
cold
sweat
oozing
out
all
over
him
it
mine
i
take
it
said
the
stranger
coolly
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
by
dragging
out
of
his
coat
pockets
first
one
chuggy
bag
of
gold
dust
and
then
another
which
he
placed
before
walter
on
the
table
here
something
to
bind
the
bargain
then
seeing
bill
critically
examining
a
pinch
of
the
dull
yellow
grains
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
added
oh
never
fear
that
the
real
stuff
you
get
the
rest
when
that
lumber
delivered
alongside
sacramento
levee
at
my
expense
talk
fast
is
it
a
whack
hold
on
stranger
cried
the
acute
charley
pushing
back
the
gold
we
do
agree
to
no
such
thing
mister
we
deliver
it
right
here
from
the
ship
the
stranger
smote
the
table
with
his
clenched
fist
ca
waste
no
time
loading
and
unloading
he
declared
that
half
the
battle
i
must
have
this
cargo
ahead
of
everybody
up
river
you
say
it
all
loaded
that
why
i
pay
high
for
it
i
do
care
shucks
how
you
get
it
there
so
fix
it
somehow
for
it
make
or
break
with
me
this
time
why
not
tow
her
up
and
back
if
he
pays
for
it
bill
suggested
the
buyer
caught
as
eagerly
at
the
idea
as
a
drowning
man
does
at
a
straw
sartin
tow
her
up
he
exclaimed
i
hire
the
boat
and
pay
all
expenses
how
many
hands
of
you
three
all
right
you
get
ten
dollars
apiece
a
day
till
the
ship
unloaded
the
man
eagerness
to
buy
his
way
through
all
obstacles
rather
confused
walter
who
now
turned
inquiringly
toward
bill
she
draws
nigh
onto
twenty
feet
this
blessed
minute
bill
said
in
a
doubtful
undertone
why
the
river
is
booming
cried
the
stranger
looking
from
one
to
the
other
with
eager
restless
eyes
as
this
unforeseen
difficulty
presented
itself
to
his
mind
again
bill
came
to
the
rescue
i
tell
ye
mates
what
we
can
do
lash
an
empty
lighter
on
each
side
of
her
that
lift
her
some
then
if
she
takes
the
ground
we
might
break
out
cargo
into
the
lighters
till
she
floats
agin
the
lumber
speculator
listened
like
one
who
hears
some
one
speaking
in
a
strange
tongue
he
however
caught
at
bill
idea
yes
that
the
how
shoah
he
joyfully
assented
i
hire
a
towboat
if
one
to
be
had
in
for
money
i
do
know
shucks
these
yer
ships
but
when
it
comes
to
steamboats
i
i
kin
tell
a
snag
from
a
catfish
i
think
we
may
risk
it
then
observed
charley
who
as
felt
all
his
responsibility
for
her
safety
walter
then
drew
up
the
contract
in
proper
form
after
which
it
was
duly
signed
sealed
and
witnessed
now
then
resumed
the
stranger
you
boys
get
everything
good
and
ready
for
a
quick
start
thar
your
dust
you
play
with
me
i
play
with
you
shake
he
then
put
off
with
bill
for
the
shore
dirt
cheap
said
charley
eying
walter
sidewise
thrown
away
groaned
walter
peevishly
by
way
of
reply
and
to
think
that
only
the
day
before
the
lumber
would
not
have
paid
for
the
unloading
xviii
a
corner
in
lumber
by
dint
of
hard
work
the
was
got
ready
to
cast
off
her
moorings
by
the
time
the
tug
came
puffing
up
alongside
early
in
the
morning
they
were
soon
under
weigh
but
the
ship
bottom
was
so
foul
that
she
towed
like
a
log
bill
steered
while
charley
and
walter
went
forward
to
pass
the
word
from
the
tug
or
tend
the
hawser
as
might
be
necessary
it
being
smooth
water
here
in
an
hour
or
so
the
tow
passed
out
into
san
pablo
bay
where
it
met
not
only
a
stiff
head
wind
but
a
nasty
little
choppy
sea
that
made
towing
slow
work
but
by
noon
they
were
abreast
of
benicia
and
entering
the
straits
of
carquinez
with
old
monte
diablo
peering
down
upon
them
on
the
starboard
hand
beyond
this
point
the
tow
steamed
across
still
another
bay
for
some
fifteen
miles
more
without
mishap
they
had
now
left
the
coast
mountains
far
behind
and
were
heading
straight
for
what
seemed
an
endless
waste
of
tall
reeds
through
which
both
the
sacramento
and
san
joaquin
wind
their
way
out
to
the
sea
so
far
plenty
of
water
and
plenty
of
sea
room
had
been
found
the
worst
was
yet
to
come
the
young
navigators
however
pushed
boldly
on
between
the
low
without
delay
feeling
much
encouraged
by
their
success
thus
far
and
wishing
to
make
the
most
of
the
short
two
hours
of
daylight
remaining
after
which
the
captain
of
the
tug
declared
it
would
be
unsafe
to
proceed
after
seeing
the
ship
tied
up
to
the
bank
for
the
night
the
tug
pushed
on
in
search
of
a
some
miles
farther
on
it
was
quite
ten
the
next
morning
before
the
boys
saw
her
come
puffing
back
around
the
next
bend
of
the
river
above
she
had
run
so
far
after
wood
that
the
captain
said
he
would
not
risk
putting
back
before
daylight
again
all
went
smoothly
until
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
to
their
great
annoyance
the
ship
suddenly
brought
up
on
a
where
she
stuck
hard
and
fast
a
hawser
was
quickly
carried
out
astern
at
which
the
tug
pulled
and
hauled
for
some
time
to
no
purpose
the
would
not
budge
an
inch
it
being
evident
that
the
ship
would
not
come
off
by
that
means
hatches
were
taken
off
the
boys
threw
off
their
coats
and
spurred
on
by
bill
report
that
he
believed
the
river
was
falling
all
hands
went
to
work
breaking
out
cargo
into
the
lighters
as
if
their
very
lives
depended
upon
their
haste
it
was
now
that
bill
foresight
came
in
for
the
warmest
commendations
as
without
the
lighters
the
voyage
must
have
ended
then
and
there
they
worked
on
like
beavers
all
the
rest
of
that
afternoon
the
tug
giving
an
occasional
pull
at
the
hawser
without
starting
the
ship
from
her
snug
berth
they
therefore
made
themselves
some
coffee
and
were
talking
the
situation
over
in
no
very
happy
frame
of
mind
when
a
large
steamboat
was
seen
heading
down
the
river
half
of
which
she
seemed
pushing
in
front
of
her
and
dragging
the
other
half
behind
stand
by
to
haul
away
shouted
bill
with
quick
presence
of
mind
to
the
men
on
the
tug
running
aft
to
take
another
turn
in
the
hawser
as
the
steamer
passed
by
churning
the
muddy
water
into
big
waves
the
tug
put
on
all
steam
the
hawser
straightened
out
as
tense
as
iron
the
big
ship
gave
a
lazy
lurch
as
a
wave
struck
her
and
to
the
unspeakable
delight
of
all
hands
they
found
themselves
once
more
afloat
and
in
deep
water
although
the
ship
was
aground
several
times
after
this
they
were
so
lucky
in
getting
her
off
that
by
noon
of
the
third
day
the
lay
snugly
moored
stem
and
stern
to
a
couple
of
live
oaks
at
the
sacramento
levee
the
first
person
to
jump
on
board
was
the
purchaser
himself
followed
by
a
gang
of
laborers
who
had
been
waiting
only
for
the
ship
arrival
to
set
to
work
at
unloading
her
cargo
meantime
the
boys
set
about
making
all
snug
aboard
and
then
after
seeing
the
balance
of
the
purchase
money
weighed
out
on
a
common
in
the
cabin
they
took
turns
in
mounting
guard
over
what
had
been
so
fairly
earned
in
plain
truth
all
three
were
fairly
dazed
by
the
possession
of
so
much
wealth
illustration
arrival
of
the
at
this
duty
of
standing
watch
and
watch
kept
the
friends
from
leaving
the
ship
even
for
a
single
moment
if
indeed
they
had
felt
the
least
desire
to
do
so
in
fact
all
that
there
was
left
of
the
late
bustling
city
was
spread
out
stark
and
grim
before
their
wondering
eyes
from
the
deck
of
the
ship
and
a
dismal
sight
it
was
acres
of
ground
so
lately
covered
with
buildings
so
full
of
busy
life
were
now
nothing
but
a
blackened
waste
of
smoldering
rubbish
here
and
there
some
solitary
tree
scorched
and
leafless
lifted
up
its
skeleton
branches
as
if
in
silent
horror
at
the
surrounding
desolation
men
singly
or
in
little
groups
were
moving
about
in
the
smoke
like
so
many
uneasy
specters
others
were
carefully
poking
among
the
rubbish
for
whatever
of
value
might
have
escaped
the
flames
but
more
strange
than
all
even
while
the
ruins
were
ablaze
about
them
it
was
to
see
a
gang
of
workmen
busy
laying
down
the
foundations
for
a
new
building
there
was
to
be
no
sitting
down
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
here
that
was
california
spirit
all
this
time
the
lumber
dealer
was
by
great
odds
the
busiest
man
there
he
was
fairly
up
to
his
ears
in
business
selling
lumber
in
small
parcels
or
great
from
the
head
of
a
barrel
to
a
perfect
mob
of
buyers
who
pushed
and
jostled
each
other
in
their
eagerness
to
be
first
served
all
were
clamoring
as
loudly
for
notice
as
so
many
congressmen
on
a
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
to
this
horde
of
hungry
applicants
the
lumberman
kept
on
repeating
first
come
first
served
down
with
your
dust
the
man
was
making
a
fortune
hand
over
fist
scarcely
had
our
boys
the
time
to
look
about
them
when
they
were
beset
with
offers
to
lease
or
even
to
buy
the
ship
outright
one
wanted
her
for
a
store
another
for
a
hotel
another
for
a
restaurant
a
saloon
and
so
on
men
even
shook
pouches
of
in
their
faces
as
an
incentive
to
close
the
bargain
on
the
spot
as
such
a
transaction
had
never
entered
their
heads
the
three
friends
held
a
hurried
consultation
over
it
charley
firmly
held
to
the
opinion
that
he
had
no
right
to
dispose
of
the
ship
without
the
owner
consent
and
that
was
something
which
could
not
be
obtained
at
this
time
walter
was
bill
was
nothing
if
not
practical
bill
was
no
fool
ef
she
goes
back
what
does
she
do
he
asked
squinting
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
why
she
lays
there
to
her
anchors
rottin
doin
nobody
no
good
he
added
she
wo
eat
or
drink
anything
if
she
does
charley
said
rather
ambiguously
seems
as
though
we
ought
to
put
her
back
where
we
found
her
walter
suggested
in
a
doubtful
sort
of
way
settle
it
to
suit
yourselves
was
bill
ready
rejoinder
but
how
does
the
case
stand
here
a
lot
of
crazy
ready
to
fight
for
her
cost
a
fortin
to
get
her
ready
for
sea
her
bottom
foul
as
a
some
of
her
copper
torn
off
upper
works
rotten
she
needs
calkin
paintin
new
riggin
new
there
hold
on
cried
charley
laughing
heartily
at
bill
truly
formidable
catalogue
of
wants
i
give
in
i
vote
to
lease
the
old
barky
by
the
month
that
is
if
walt
here
thinks
as
i
do
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
walter
assented
decisively
so
the
bargain
was
concluded
before
the
cargo
was
half
out
of
the
ship
so
eager
was
the
lessee
to
get
possession
walter
drew
up
the
lease
a
month
rent
was
paid
in
advance
and
the
thing
was
done
well
now
boys
that
off
our
minds
said
charley
gleefully
my
head
been
turning
round
like
a
ever
since
this
thing
been
talked
about
and
a
good
job
too
seein
as
how
we
skipped
without
a
clearance
bill
put
in
quietly
the
two
friends
looked
at
him
blankly
then
at
each
other
it
was
plain
that
no
such
matter
had
ever
entered
their
minds
charley
gave
a
long
low
whistle
by
george
i
never
thought
of
that
he
exclaimed
in
great
ill
humor
with
bill
what
they
do
to
us
no
use
cryin
over
spilt
milk
said
that
worthy
keep
dark
our
lay
did
noah
ark
sail
without
a
clearance
without
papers
or
flag
and
for
no
port
he
added
we
out
as
the
sayin
is
with
a
vengeance
charley
remarked
trying
to
turn
the
matter
off
with
a
joke
there
only
one
thing
for
us
to
do
said
walter
and
that
is
to
go
right
up
to
the
and
explain
matters
to
the
collector
when
we
get
back
to
the
bay
perhaps
he
let
us
off
with
a
fine
when
he
finds
we
did
mean
to
run
away
with
the
ship
and
turn
pirates
the
idea
of
turning
the
old
into
a
pirate
was
so
comical
that
all
three
joined
in
a
hearty
laugh
what
to
do
with
all
their
money
was
the
most
perplexing
question
they
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
for
thinking
of
it
in
every
face
they
saw
a
thief
every
footstep
startled
them
in
their
dilemma
it
was
determined
that
the
safer
way
would
be
to
divide
it
up
between
them
three
miner
belts
were
therefore
procured
and
after
locking
themselves
up
in
the
cabin
the
three
friends
stuffed
these
belts
as
full
as
they
would
hold
with
the
precious
metal
but
there
was
still
a
pile
left
to
be
disposed
of
when
this
was
done
so
bill
suggested
sewing
the
remainder
in
their
shirts
at
it
they
went
without
more
words
sitting
meantime
in
their
trousers
and
undershirts
and
a
truly
comical
sight
was
this
original
sewing
circle
stitching
away
for
dear
life
under
lock
and
key
but
even
when
this
operation
was
finished
a
heap
of
the
shining
metal
still
lay
on
the
table
before
them
all
were
so
weighed
down
with
what
they
had
about
them
that
they
waddled
rather
than
walked
bill
declared
that
if
anything
happened
to
the
boat
at
their
returning
they
would
all
sink
to
the
bottom
like
so
much
lead
while
thus
at
their
wits
end
charley
eagle
eye
chanced
to
fall
upon
an
old
fowling
piece
hung
up
by
some
hooks
in
the
cabin
this
was
quickly
torn
from
its
resting
place
the
charges
drawn
and
while
the
others
looked
on
in
silent
wonder
charley
filled
both
barrels
with
gold
dust
after
which
the
muzzles
were
tightly
fitted
with
corks
she
loaded
for
big
game
we
take
turns
carryin
her
do
you
see
he
remarked
with
a
broad
grin
towards
dusk
the
trio
took
passage
on
board
the
first
boat
bound
for
the
bay
nor
did
they
feel
themselves
wholly
safe
with
their
treasure
until
they
once
more
trod
the
deck
of
the
old
fairly
worn
out
with
a
week
of
such
rapidly
shifting
fortunes
as
no
one
but
an
old
californian
has
ever
experienced
the
three
inseparables
were
snugly
rolled
up
in
their
blankets
bill
loudly
snoring
in
his
bunk
when
the
distant
booming
of
a
gun
caused
walter
to
raise
his
head
and
say
drowsily
hello
a
steamer
in
i
do
care
if
there
twenty
steamers
charley
yawned
at
the
same
time
burying
his
nose
still
deeper
under
his
blanket
i
was
almost
gone
and
now
you
made
me
begin
all
over
again
all
ashore
goin
ashore
xix
hearts
of
gold
mr
bright
came
in
that
steamer
as
walter
letter
seemed
to
hold
out
fair
hopes
of
recovering
some
part
of
the
and
her
cargo
the
merchant
had
decided
to
look
into
the
matter
himself
though
in
truth
both
he
and
his
partners
had
long
regarded
the
venture
as
a
dead
loss
had
he
suddenly
dropped
from
the
clouds
the
little
company
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
than
when
the
merchant
stepped
on
deck
smiling
benignantly
at
the
evident
consternation
he
thus
created
after
a
hearty
greeting
all
round
though
poor
walter
turned
all
colors
at
the
remembrance
of
how
and
where
they
had
last
met
mr
bright
began
by
explaining
that
he
had
found
them
out
through
the
consignee
of
the
but
where
in
the
world
is
the
he
asked
here
has
the
boatman
been
rowing
me
around
for
the
last
hour
trying
to
find
her
nothing
has
happened
to
her
i
hope
he
hastily
added
observing
the
friends
exchanging
sly
glances
this
question
of
course
led
to
an
explanation
from
walter
during
which
the
old
merchant
face
was
a
study
his
first
look
of
annoyance
soon
changed
to
one
of
blank
amazement
finally
settling
down
into
a
broad
smile
of
complete
satisfaction
when
the
story
was
all
told
then
he
shook
his
gray
head
as
if
the
problem
was
quite
too
knotty
for
him
to
solve
how
these
boys
hardly
out
of
their
teens
should
have
dared
first
to
engage
in
such
a
brilliant
transaction
and
then
have
succeeded
in
carrying
it
through
to
the
end
without
a
hitch
pretty
well
for
beginners
i
must
say
he
finally
declared
taken
altogether
that
about
the
boldest
operation
i
ever
heard
of
and
i
known
a
few
in
my
experience
as
a
business
man
but
looking
at
walter
where
all
this
money
quite
safe
i
hope
by
way
of
answer
the
young
men
brought
out
their
treasure
from
various
ingenious
the
fowling
piece
included
when
all
the
belts
and
parcels
of
dust
were
piled
in
a
heap
on
the
table
mr
bright
sat
for
some
time
with
his
hand
over
his
eyes
without
speaking
what
the
merchant
thoughts
were
it
were
vain
to
guess
finally
he
said
you
seem
to
have
done
everything
for
the
best
bill
here
was
quite
right
about
the
ship
she
is
earning
something
where
she
is
at
least
now
about
the
cargo
turning
to
walter
i
think
you
said
in
your
letter
that
charley
here
bought
half
of
that
in
walter
gave
a
nod
of
assent
why
then
resumed
mr
bright
as
the
other
half
belongs
to
his
partner
i
do
see
that
we
anything
to
do
with
this
money
perhaps
we
may
compromise
as
to
the
ship
he
added
looking
at
charley
charley
then
explained
his
agreement
with
his
partner
who
had
so
mysteriously
disappeared
i
sold
out
to
walter
settle
it
with
him
he
finished
jamming
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
turning
away
well
then
walter
what
do
you
say
i
say
that
charley
ought
to
have
half
the
profits
why
when
i
wrote
you
the
lumber
was
worthless
besides
charley
did
all
the
business
settle
it
with
him
i
see
the
situation
was
changed
from
a
matter
of
a
few
hundreds
to
thousands
shortly
after
your
letter
was
written
walter
nodded
and
you
do
care
to
take
advantage
of
it
walter
simply
folded
his
arms
defiantly
but
between
you
you
saved
the
cargo
the
merchant
rejoined
we
no
claim
you
must
come
to
terms
was
there
no
writing
walter
scowled
fiercely
at
charley
who
notwithstanding
immediately
produced
his
copy
of
the
agreement
the
merchant
glanced
over
it
with
a
smile
hovering
on
his
lips
why
this
is
perfectly
good
he
declared
well
then
as
neither
of
you
has
a
proposition
to
make
i
make
you
one
perhaps
walter
here
felt
under
a
moral
obligation
to
look
after
our
interests
in
spite
of
the
unjust
treatment
he
had
received
that
i
can
now
understand
and
i
ask
his
pardon
but
you
charles
had
no
such
inducement
no
inducement
charley
broke
out
with
a
quivering
lip
no
inducement
heh
to
see
that
boy
righted
he
repeated
struggling
hard
to
keep
down
the
lump
in
his
throat
axin
pardons
do
mend
no
broken
crockery
observed
bill
gruffly
mr
bright
showed
no
resentment
at
this
plain
speech
he
sat
wiping
his
glasses
in
deep
thought
perhaps
there
was
just
a
little
moisture
in
his
own
eyes
over
this
evidence
of
two
hearts
linked
together
as
in
bands
of
steel
the
silence
was
growing
oppressive
when
walter
nerved
himself
to
say
you
see
sir
charley
and
me
we
are
of
one
mind
as
for
me
perfectly
satisfied
to
take
what
i
put
in
to
fit
charley
out
provided
you
pay
him
back
his
investment
and
what
right
for
his
and
time
and
trouble
charley
coughed
a
little
at
this
liberal
proposal
but
walter
signed
to
him
to
keep
quiet
bill
grunted
out
something
that
might
pass
for
consent
but
mr
bright
was
not
the
man
to
take
advantage
of
so
much
generosity
in
truth
he
had
already
formed
in
his
own
mind
a
plan
by
which
to
come
to
an
agreement
changing
the
subject
for
the
moment
he
suddenly
asked
by
the
way
have
you
never
heard
anything
of
ramon
at
this
unexpected
question
a
broad
grin
stole
over
the
faces
of
the
three
kidnapers
i
was
coming
to
that
walter
replied
bringing
out
from
his
chest
the
money
and
papers
which
ramon
had
been
so
lately
compelled
to
disgorge
the
merchant
took
them
in
his
hands
ran
his
eye
rapidly
over
them
and
exclaimed
in
astonishment
what
did
he
make
this
restitution
of
his
own
accord
wonders
will
never
cease
i
declare
well
no
sir
not
exactly
that
the
truth
is
he
was
a
trifle
obstinate
about
it
at
first
but
we
found
a
way
to
persuade
him
that
confession
was
signed
in
the
very
same
chair
you
are
now
sitting
in
mr
bright
again
said
with
a
sigh
of
deep
satisfaction
marvelous
we
shall
now
pay
everything
we
owe
except
our
debt
to
you
walter
that
we
can
never
pay
if
my
good
name
is
cleared
i
perfectly
satisfied
walter
rejoined
a
little
nervously
yet
with
a
feeling
that
this
was
the
happiest
day
of
his
life
and
his
good
name
too
why
do
you
say
interrupted
the
bill
from
his
corner
seems
to
me
that
about
the
size
of
it
he
finished
casting
a
meaning
look
at
the
dignified
old
merchant
who
sat
there
twiddling
his
glasses
clearly
oppressed
by
the
feeling
that
as
between
himself
and
walter
walter
had
acted
the
nobler
part
he
could
hardly
control
a
slight
tremor
in
his
voice
when
he
began
to
speak
again
i
see
how
it
is
he
said
you
return
good
for
evil
it
was
nobly
done
i
grant
you
nobly
done
but
you
must
not
wonder
at
my
surprise
for
i
own
i
expected
nothing
of
the
sort
still
all
the
generosity
must
not
be
on
one
side
by
no
means
since
i
sat
here
i
been
thinking
that
now
we
are
embarked
in
the
california
trade
we
do
better
than
to
start
a
branch
of
the
concern
in
this
city
now
do
interrupt
raising
an
admonitory
hand
until
you
hear
me
through
if
you
walter
and
you
charles
in
whom
i
have
every
confidence
if
you
two
will
accept
an
equal
partnership
your
actual
expenses
to
be
paid
at
any
rate
we
will
put
all
the
profits
of
this
lumber
trade
of
yours
into
the
new
house
to
start
with
suppose
we
call
it
bright
seabury
company
fix
that
to
suit
yourselves
only
my
name
ought
to
stand
first
i
think
because
it
will
set
walter
here
right
before
the
world
neither
walter
nor
charley
could
have
said
one
word
for
the
life
of
him
so
much
were
they
taken
by
surprise
bill
eyes
fairly
bulged
out
of
his
shaggy
head
mr
bright
went
on
to
say
with
our
credit
restored
we
can
send
you
all
the
goods
you
may
want
suppose
we
now
go
and
deposit
this
money
to
the
new
firm
credit
one
half
in
trust
for
charles
former
partner
i
myself
will
put
a
notice
of
the
copartnership
in
papers
and
as
soon
as
i
get
home
in
the
boston
papers
and
i
should
greatly
like
to
see
the
new
sign
up
before
i
go
it
was
a
long
speech
but
never
was
one
listened
to
with
more
rapt
attention
charley
turned
as
red
as
a
beet
walter
hung
his
head
bill
blew
his
nose
for
a
full
where
does
bill
come
in
he
demanded
with
a
comical
side
glance
at
the
merchant
his
question
with
the
long
face
he
put
on
relieved
the
strain
at
once
oh
never
fear
old
chap
you
shall
have
my
place
and
pay
on
the
old
ship
charley
hastened
to
assure
him
then
you
accept
said
mr
bright
shaking
hands
with
each
of
the
new
partners
in
turn
something
tells
me
that
this
is
the
best
investment
of
my
life
the
papers
shall
be
made
out
while
we
are
looking
up
a
store
together
really
now
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
give
a
little
dinner
in
honor
of
the
new
firm
long
life
and
prosperity
to
it
where
shall
it
be
what
ails
this
old
ship
where
the
old
house
came
to
life
agin
an
the
new
babby
wuz
fust
born
inter
the
world
was
bill
ready
suggestion
capital
could
be
better
exclaimed
the
merchant
and
now
taking
out
his
notebook
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
each
of
you
personally
when
i
get
back
to
the
states
walter
spoke
first
please
look
up
my
old
aunty
and
see
her
made
comfortable
mr
bright
jotted
down
the
address
with
an
approving
nod
then
looked
up
at
charley
send
out
a
couple
of
donkey
engines
horses
are
too
slow
mr
bright
then
turned
to
bill
me
oh
well
i
got
no
aunt
i
no
use
for
donkeys
you
might
lick
that
sneakin
perleeceman
on
the
wharf
an
send
me
his
resate
when
the
two
young
men
took
leave
of
mr
bright
on
board
the
after
a
hearty
all
round
that
gentleman
gave
them
this
parting
advice
make
all
the
friends
you
can
and
keep
them
if
you
can
remember
nothing
is
easier
than
to
make
enemies
at
a
meaning
look
from
walter
charley
withdrew
himself
out
of
earshot
walter
fidgeted
a
little
blushed
and
then
managed
to
ask
have
i
your
permission
to
write
to
miss
dora
sir
mr
bright
looked
surprised
then
serious
then
amused
oho
now
i
begin
to
catch
on
that
how
the
land
lies
is
it
so
that
was
the
reason
why
you
were
prowling
around
our
house
one
night
after
dark
was
it
well
well
certainly
you
may
write
to
dora
and
by
the
way
when
next
you
pass
through
our
street
you
may
ring
the
doorbell
xx
bright
seabury
company
thus
the
new
firm
entered
upon
its
future
career
with
bright
prospects
a
suitable
warehouse
on
the
waterfront
was
leased
for
a
term
of
years
true
to
their
determination
to
stick
together
the
two
junior
partners
fitted
up
a
room
in
the
second
story
and
on
the
day
that
the
doors
were
first
opened
for
business
they
moved
in
the
next
thing
was
to
get
some
business
to
do
charley
had
a
considerable
acquaintance
among
the
ranchmen
across
the
bay
which
he
now
improved
by
making
frequent
trips
to
solicit
consignments
of
country
produce
the
sight
of
an
empty
store
and
bare
walls
was
at
first
depressing
but
their
first
shipments
from
the
east
could
not
be
expected
for
several
months
there
was
a
sort
of
tacit
understanding
that
walter
should
attend
to
the
financial
end
of
the
business
while
charley
took
care
of
the
outdoor
concerns
they
were
no
longer
boys
the
sense
of
assumed
responsibilities
had
made
them
men
the
two
partners
were
busy
receiving
a
of
potatoes
with
their
shirt
sleeves
rolled
up
when
a
big
burly
bewhiskered
individual
dropped
in
upon
them
scenting
a
customer
charley
always
forward
briskly
asked
what
they
could
do
for
him
i
want
to
see
the
senior
partner
charley
nodded
toward
walter
who
was
checking
off
the
weights
the
man
gave
a
quick
look
at
the
tall
straight
young
fellow
before
him
then
said
can
i
speak
to
you
in
private
for
five
minutes
come
this
way
walter
replied
showing
the
stranger
into
the
little
office
the
newcomer
sat
down
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
stroked
his
long
beard
reflectively
a
little
and
said
i
come
on
a
very
confidential
matter
can
i
depend
upon
the
strictest
privacy
you
may
said
walter
quite
astonished
at
this
rather
unexpected
opening
nobody
will
interrupt
us
here
the
man
cast
an
inquisitive
look
around
as
if
to
make
sure
there
were
no
eavesdroppers
near
then
lowering
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
said
pointedly
you
may
have
heard
something
about
a
plan
to
aid
the
poor
oppressed
natives
of
nicaragua
to
throw
off
the
tyrannical
yoke
of
their
present
rulers
i
seen
something
to
that
effect
in
the
papers
said
walter
evasively
so
much
the
better
that
clears
the
way
of
cobwebs
i
want
your
solemn
promise
that
what
passes
between
us
shall
not
be
divulged
to
a
human
being
i
have
no
business
secrets
from
my
partners
walter
objected
your
partners
oh
of
course
not
i
already
promised
walter
assented
more
and
more
mystified
by
the
stranger
manner
nobody
asked
you
for
your
secrets
you
can
do
as
you
like
about
telling
them
he
continued
rather
sharply
i
trust
you
you
are
a
young
concern
well
connected
references
likely
to
get
on
top
of
the
heap
and
want
to
make
a
strike
nothing
like
seizing
upon
a
golden
opportunity
is
a
tide
you
know
the
rest
now
i
just
the
man
to
put
you
in
the
way
of
doing
it
as
easy
as
rolling
off
a
log
as
walter
made
no
reply
the
visitor
after
waiting
a
moment
for
his
words
to
take
effect
went
on
now
listen
i
do
mind
telling
you
in
the
strictest
confidence
then
that
i
fiscal
agent
for
this
here
enterprise
i
in
it
for
glory
and
the
we
want
some
enterprising
young
firm
like
yours
to
furnish
supplies
for
the
emigrants
we
sending
down
there
jerking
his
head
toward
the
south
there
a
big
pile
in
it
for
you
if
you
will
take
hold
with
us
and
see
the
thing
through
walter
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
speaker
but
said
nothing
you
see
it
a
perfectly
legitimate
transaction
do
you
resumed
the
fiscal
agent
a
little
anxiously
then
why
so
much
secrecy
oh
there
always
a
lot
of
people
prying
round
into
what
concern
them
busybodies
if
it
gets
out
that
our
people
peaceable
emigrants
before
we
good
and
ready
the
whole
thing
might
get
knocked
into
a
cocked
hat
they
say
well
they
even
might
call
us
filibusters
the
man
admitted
with
an
injured
air
walter
smiled
a
knowing
smile
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
he
asked
in
the
first
place
we
want
cornmeal
hard
bread
bacon
potatoes
an
sich
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
for
two
months
i
can
give
you
the
figures
to
a
dot
the
agent
rejoined
on
whom
walter
smile
had
not
been
lost
see
here
he
drew
out
of
his
pocket
a
package
of
freshly
printed
bonds
purporting
to
be
issued
by
authority
of
the
republic
of
nicaragua
and
passed
them
over
for
walter
inspection
now
the
fact
is
we
want
all
our
ready
funds
for
the
outfit
advance
money
vessel
charter
and
so
on
now
i
going
to
be
liberal
with
you
i
put
up
this
bunch
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
in
bonds
payable
on
the
day
nicaragua
is
free
for
five
thousand
dollars
worth
of
provisions
at
market
price
think
of
that
twenty
thousand
dollars
for
five
thousand
dollars
you
ca
lose
we
got
things
all
fixed
down
there
why
man
there
silver
and
gold
and
jewels
enough
in
the
churches
alone
to
pay
those
bonds
ten
times
over
what
rob
the
churches
walter
exclaimed
knitting
his
brows
why
no
i
believe
they
call
that
merely
a
forced
loan
nowadays
objected
the
fiscal
agent
in
some
embarrassment
seeing
that
he
paused
for
a
reply
walter
observed
that
he
would
consult
his
partner
charley
was
called
in
and
the
proposal
gone
over
again
with
him
as
soon
as
advised
of
its
purport
he
turned
on
his
heel
not
any
in
mine
was
his
prompt
decision
mine
either
assented
walter
the
stranger
seemed
much
disappointed
but
not
yet
at
the
end
of
his
resources
well
then
he
began
again
you
take
the
bonds
sell
them
for
a
fair
discount
for
cash
and
use
the
proceeds
towards
those
provisions
had
you
better
do
that
yourself
we
not
brokers
commission
merchants
if
you
come
to
us
with
cash
in
hand
we
sell
you
anything
money
will
buy
and
no
questions
asked
but
nicaragua
bonds
payable
any
time
and
no
time
are
not
in
our
line
so
said
walter
not
much
echoed
charley
your
line
seems
to
be
small
potatoes
muttered
the
stranger
testily
then
quickly
checking
himself
he
carelessly
asked
i
suppose
you
have
no
objection
to
keeping
these
bonds
in
your
safe
for
a
day
or
two
for
me
giving
me
a
receipt
for
them
or
the
equivalent
i
do
feel
half
easy
about
carrying
them
about
with
me
why
no
said
charley
looking
at
walter
to
see
how
he
would
take
it
yes
objected
walter
most
decidedly
who
boss
here
anyhow
sneered
the
agent
dismissing
his
wheedling
tone
now
that
he
had
played
his
last
card
even
charley
seemed
a
trifle
nettled
at
being
snubbed
by
walter
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
after
all
it
seemed
a
trifling
favor
to
ask
of
them
my
partner
and
i
can
settle
that
matter
between
ourselves
once
for
all
we
do
choose
to
be
mixed
up
in
your
filibustering
schemes
in
any
way
your
five
minutes
have
grown
to
of
an
hour
already
this
is
our
busy
day
he
concluded
as
a
broad
hint
to
the
stranger
to
take
leave
and
at
once
very
well
said
the
unmoved
fiscal
agent
buttoning
up
his
coat
but
you
repent
all
the
same
having
thrown
away
the
finest
opportunity
of
making
a
fortune
ever
offered
this
way
out
sir
charley
interrupted
throwing
wide
the
office
door
when
the
strange
visitor
had
gone
charley
asked
walter
why
he
refused
to
let
the
bonds
be
put
in
the
safe
now
we
made
an
enemy
he
said
resignedly
to
let
him
raise
money
on
that
receipt
for
twenty
thousand
dollars
on
mr
bright
name
no
where
were
your
wits

that
fellow
a
sharper
guess
i
better
attend
to
those
potatoes
was
all
the
junior
partner
could
find
to
say
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
as
was
quite
natural
much
curiosity
was
felt
as
to
what
had
become
of
ramon
by
his
former
business
associates
in
some
way
he
had
found
out
that
mr
bright
was
in
san
francisco
and
taking
counsel
of
his
fears
of
being
sent
back
to
boston
as
a
confessed
felon
he
cast
his
lot
among
the
most
lawless
adventurers
of
the
day
learning
that
a
filibustering
expedition
was
being
fitted
out
at
san
francisco
against
lower
california
under
command
of
walker
the
man
of
destiny
ramon
joined
it
keeping
in
hiding
meanwhile
until
the
vessel
was
ready
to
sail
as
is
well
known
the
affair
was
a
complete
failure
walker
famished
band
being
compelled
to
surrender
to
the
united
states
officers
at
san
diego
from
this
time
ramon
disappeared
some
five
years
later
a
young
man
robust
and
well
though
not
foppishly
dressed
drove
up
to
the
door
of
a
pretty
cottage
in
one
of
the
most
fashionable
suburbs
of
boston
alighting
from
his
buggy
and
hitching
his
horse
he
walked
quickly
up
the
driveway
to
the
house
the
front
door
flew
open
by
the
time
he
had
put
his
hand
on
the
knob
and
a
young
woman
with
the
matchless
new
england
pink
and
white
in
her
cheeks
called
out
why
