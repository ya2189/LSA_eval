a
difficulty
in

room
for

no
wonder
the
elite
of
brighton
like
the
west
pier
it
is
one
of
the
most

spots
in

luxury
and
comfort
is
there
a
good
library
plenty
of
newspapers
elegant
little
shops
excellent
refreshment
rooms
fine
music
and
then
the
lovely
blue
dimpling
sea
the
little
boats
with
their
white
sails
like
birds
on
the
water
the
grand
stretch
of
the
waves
the
blue
sky
overhead
and
the
town
with
its
fine
tall
houses
shining
in
the
sunlight
the
line
of
white
cliff
and
the
beach
where
the
children
are
at
play
you
go
down
to
the
wonderful
jetty
which
to
me
was
one
of
the
most
mysterious
and
romantic
of
places
there
the
water
is
of
the
deepest
choicest
emerald
green
and
it
washes
the
wonderful
of
poles
with
a
soft
lapping
sound
beautiful
to
hear
you
can
stand
there
with
only
a
rail
between
you
and
the
green
deep
water
watching
the
out
on
the
deep
watching
perhaps
the
steamer
with
its
load
of
passengers
or
looking
over
the
wide
sunlit
waves
dreaming
dreams
born
of
the
sea
out
of
the
world
alone
in
the
kingdom
of
fancy
there
is
always
something
weird
in
the
presence
of
deep
silent
moving
waters
there
is
always
plenty
of
life
gayety
and
fashion
on
the
west
pier
it
is
a
famous
place
not
for
but
for
flirtation
a
famous
place
for
studying
human
nature
a
famous
place
for
passing
a
pleasant
hour
you
may
often
meet
great
celebrities
on
the
west
pier
faces
familiar
at
the
house
of
lords
familiar
at
court
familiar
at
the
opera
are
to
be
seen
there
during
the
season
beautiful
faces
that
have
grown
pale
and
worn
with
the
excitement
of
a
london
campaign
and
here
as
they
are
bent
thoughtfully
over
the
green
waters
the
bracing
air
brings
sweet
roses
the
lines
fade
the
eyes
brighten
there
is
no
such
beautifier
as
a
sea
breeze
no
bloom
so
radiant
and
charming
as
that
brought
by
the
wind
from
the
sea
on
the
west
pier
you
will
find
all
the
beauty
rank
and
fashion
of
brighton
you
will
see
costumes
a
ravir
dresses
that
are
artistic
and
elegant
you
will
see
faces
beautiful
and
you
will
hear
a
charming
ripple
of
conversation
you
will
witness
many
pleasant
and
piquant
adventures
but
if
you
want
to
dream
if
you
want
to
give
up
your
whole
heart
and
soul
to
the
poetry
of
the
sea
if
you
want
to
listen
to
its
voice
and
hear
no
other
if
you
want
to
shut
yourself
away
from
the
world
if
you
want
to
hear
the
music
of
the
winds
their
whispers
their
lullabies
their
mad
dashes
their
frantic
rages
you
must
go
to
the
old
chain
pier
as
a
rule
you
will
find
few
there
but
you
may
know
they
are
a
special
few
you
will
see
the
grave
quiet
face
of
the
thinker
who
has
chosen
that
spot
because
he
does
not
want
to
be
disturbed
by
the
of
ladies
dresses
or
the
music
of
their
happy
voices
he
wants
to
be
alone
with
the
sea
and
the
wind
it
often
happens
that
you
find
a
pair
of
very
happy
lovers
there
they
go
to
the
side
and
lean
over
the
railing
as
though
their
sole
object
in
life
was
to
watch
the
rippling
sea
do
not
believe
them
for
you
will
hear
the
murmur
of
two
voices
and
the
theme
is
always
love
if
you
go
near
them
they
look
shyly
at
you
and
in
a
few
minutes
move
gently
away
ah
happy
lovers
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
it
does
not
shine
always
even
over
the
chain
pier
if
you
want
to
watch
the
waves
to
hear
their
rolling
music
if
you
want
to
see
the
seagulls
whirl
in
the
blue
ether
if
you
want
to
think
to
read
to
be
alone
to
fill
your
mind
with
beautiful
thoughts
go
to
the
chain
pier
at
brighton
there
is
a
jetty
an
weird
place
where
the
green
water
rushes
swiftly
and
washes
round
the
green
wood
where
there
is
always
a
beautiful
sound
of
the
rising
and
falling
of
the
sea
where
you
may
sit
on
one
of
the
seats
seeing
nothing
but
water
and
sky
around
you
until
you
can
fancy
yourself
out
in
the
wide
ocean
until
you
can
wrap
your
thoughts
and
your
senses
in
the
very
mists
of
romance
time
was
when
the
chain
pier
at
brighton
was
one
of
the
wonders
of
england
and
even
now
with
its
picturesque
chains
and
arches
i
like
it
better
than
any
other
i
may
as
well
tell
the
truth
while
i
write
of
it
i
know
that
if
the
dead
can
rise
from
their
graves
i
shall
the
chain
pier
at
brighton
i
spent
one
hour
there
that
was
the
hour
of
my
life
one
madly
happy
bewildering
hour
i
remember
the
plank
of
wood
on
which
my
feet
rested
i
remember
the
railing
over
which
i
heard
the
green
deep
water
with
the
boat
in
the
distance
sails
like
the
white
wings
of
angels
beckoning
me
away
the
blue
sky
with
the
few
fleecy
white
clouds
the
wash
of
the
waters
against
the
woodwork
of
the
pier
and
i
remember
the
face
that
looked
down
into
mine
all
heaven
lay
in
it
for
me
the
deep
water
the
blue
sky
the
handsome
face
the
measured
rhythms
of
the
sea
the
calm
tones
of
the
clear
waves
are
all
mixed
in
one
dream
i
cry
out
in
anguish
at
times
that
heaven
may
send
me
such
another
but
it
can
never
be
if
the
dead
can
return
i
shall
stand
once
more
where
i
stood
then
i
will
not
tell
my
story
now
but
rather
tell
of
the
tragedy
with
which
the
chain
pier
at
brighton
is
associated
for
evermore
in
my
mind
i
had
gone
down
to
brighton
for
my
health
and
i
was
staying
at
the
most
comfortable
and
luxurious
of
hotels
the
norfolk
it
was
the
end
of
september
and
the
only
peculiarity
of
the
month
that
i
remember
was
this
the
nights
grew
dark
very
soon
they
were
not
cold
the
darkness
was
rather
that
of
soft
thick
gloom
that
spread
over
land
and
sea
no
one
need
ever
feel
dull
in
brighton
if
i
could
have
liked
billiards
or
cared
for
the
theater
or
enjoyed
the
brilliant
shops
on
the
crowded
pier
with
its
fine
music
i
might
have
been
happy
enough
but
i
was
miserable
with
this
aching
pain
of
regret
and
the
chill
desolation
of
a
terrible
loss
i
tried
the
aquarium
if
fishes
could
soothe
the
heart
of
man
solace
might
be
found
there
but
to
my
morbid
fancy
they
looked
at
me
with
wide
open
eyes
of
wonder
they
knew
the
secrets
of
the
sea
the
faint
stir
of
life
in
the
beautiful
anemones
had
lost
its
interest
i
could
not
smile
at
the
king
crabs
the
reading
tables
and
the
music
had
no
interest
for
me
outwardly
i
was
walking
through
the
magnificent
halls
of
the
aquarium
inwardly
my
heart
was
beating
to
the
mournful
rhythms
of
the
sea
the
clock
had
not
struck
seven
when
i
came
out
and
there
lying
before
me
was
the
chain
pier
i
went
there
as
naturally
as
the
needle
goes
to
the
magnet
the
moon
shone
with
a
fitful
light
at
times
it
was
bright
as
day
flooded
the
sea
with
silver
and
showed
the
chain
and
the
arches
of
the
pier
as
plainly
as
the
sun
could
have
done
showed
the
running
of
the
waves
they
were
busy
that
evening
and
came
in
fast
spreading
out
in
great
sheets
of
white
foam
and
when
the
moonlight
did
touch
the
foam
it
was
beautiful
to
see
but
my
lady
moon
was
coquettish
every
now
and
then
she
hid
her
face
behind
a
drifting
cloud
then
the
soft
thick
gloom
fell
again
and
the
pier
lay
like
a
huge
shadow
the
very
place
i
thought
in
which
a
tortured
heart
could
grow
calm
there
was
only
the
wind
and
the
sea
nothing
more
i
would
go
to
the
spot
where
we
two
should
stand
together
never
more
i
fancied
as
i
paid
for
admission
at
the
gate
that
the
face
of
the
person
who
received
it
expressed
some
surprise
it
must
have
seemed
a
strange
taste
but
ah
me
there
had
bloomed
for
me
for
one
short
hour
the
flowers
of
paradise
the
thick
soft
gloom
was
deeper
on
the
pier
i
remember
that
as
i
walked
down
i
heard
from
the
church
clocks
the
hour
of
eight
all
along
the
coast
there
was
a
line
of
light
the
town
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
when
i
looked
across
the
waters
the
west
pier
was
in
all
its
radiance
the
sound
of
the
music
floated
over
the
waves
to
me
the
light
of
the
colored
lamps
shone
far
and
wide
i
could
see
the
moving
mass
of
people
here
i
was
almost
alone
i
saw
a
gentleman
smoking
a
cigar
i
saw
the
inevitable
lovers
i
saw
an
old
man
with
an
iron
face
i
saw
two
young
men
almost
boys
what
had
brought
them
there
i
could
not
think
i
reached
the
where
the
huge
lamp
had
been
lighted
and
shone
like
a
great
brilliant
jewel
i
sat
down
there
was
no
greater
pleasure
for
me
than
an
evening
spent
there
at
first
all
was
quite
still
the
gentleman
smoking
his
cigar
walked
up
and
down
the
two
youths
who
had
evidently
mistaken
the
nature
of
the
pier
and
considered
themselves
greatly
injured
by
the
absence
of
music
and
company
went
away
the
old
man
sat
still
for
some
time
then
he
left
i
was
alone
then
with
the
smoker
who
troubled
himself
very
little
about
me
the
coquettish
moon
threw
a
wide
laughing
gleam
around
then
vanished
a
whole
pile
of
thick
dark
clouds
came
up
from
the
west
and
hid
her
fair
face
by
them
the
thick
soft
gloom
had
deepened
into
darkness
i
was
far
from
expecting
anything
tragical
as
i
sat
there
cold
and
desolate
lonely
as
it
was
the
chain
pier
was
more
like
home
to
me
than
any
other
spot
on
earth
because
of
the
one
hour
i
had
spent
there
the
wind
began
to
freshen
and
blow
coldly
where
i
sat
i
had
no
motive
in
changing
my
seat
except
to
escape
the
sharpness
of
the
breeze
i
crossed
to
the
other
side
where
the
white
line
of
cliffs
lay
away
from
the
brilliant
lights
of
the
west
pier
hidden
behind
the
wooden
structure
erected
to
shelter
those
on
the
pier
i
gave
myself
up
to
my
dreams
i
can
not
tell
how
it
was
but
many
ghostly
stories
that
i
had
read
about
piers
came
to
my
mind
for
instance
now
how
easy
it
would
be
for
any
man
to
steal
up
to
me
through
the
thick
soft
shadowy
mist
and
murder
me
before
i
had
time
even
to
utter
a
cry
i
might
be
thrown
over
into
the
sea
then
i
said
to
myself
what
a
foolish
thought
i
was
close
to
many
people
such
a
murder
was
quite
impossible
yet
i
was
foolish
enough
to
turn
my
head
and
try
to
peer
through
the
darkness
to
see
if
any
one
was
near
the
tall
slender
figure
of
a
woman
dressed
in
a
dark
cloak
was
slowly
walking
up
the
middle
of
the
pier
she
could
not
see
me
but
i
saw
her
plainly
distinctly
i
noticed
the
grace
of
her
movements
her
grand
carriage
she
was
closely
veiled
so
that
i
could
not
see
her
face
but
unless
i
was
much
mistaken
she
carried
a
bundle
of
something
held
tightly
under
her
arm
chapter
ii
if
this
had
been
an
ordinary
woman
i
should
not
have
noticed
her
beyond
the
passing
regard
of
the
moment
it
was
the
grace
of
her
walk
that
attracted
my
attention
and
i
felt
sure
that
as
she
passed
my
by
i
heard
the
sound
of
bitter
passionate
sobbing
the
old
story
over
again
i
thought
sorrow
and
pain
longing
and
love
but
for
the
sound
of
that
sob
as
she
passed
me
i
should
not
have
watched
her
i
should
not
have
known
what
afterward
i
would
have
given
my
life
not
to
know
she
walked
right
on
to
the
very
head
of
the
pier
and
stood
there
for
a
few
minutes
i
knew
by
instinct
that
she
was
crying
bitterly
then
i
was
struck
by
the
manner
in
which
she
looked
round
it
was
evident
to
me
that
she
wished
to
be
quite
alone
at
times
the
waves
playing
round
the
wooden
pillars
made
some
unusual
sound
she
turned
quickly
as
though
she
suspected
some
one
was
near
her
once
a
gentleman
strolled
leisurely
down
the
pier
stood
for
a
few
minutes
watching
the
sea
in
silence
then
went
away
while
he
was
there
she
stood
still
and
motionless
as
a
statue
then
she
looked
round
with
a
stealthy
gaze
a
gaze
so
unlike
the
free
grand
grace
of
her
movements
that
i
was
struck
by
it
she
could
not
see
me
because
i
was
in
the
deep
shadow
but
i
could
see
every
gesture
of
hers
i
saw
her
raise
her
face
to
the
darkling
skies
and
i
felt
that
some
despairing
prayer
was
on
her
lip
and
the
reason
why
i
could
see
her
so
plainly
was
this
that
she
stood
just
where
the
rays
of
the
lamps
fell
brightly
it
was
a
dramatic
scene
the
dark
heaving
sea
with
the
fitful
gleam
of
the
moonlight
the
silent
pier
with
the
one
huge
light
the
tall
dark
figure
standing
there
so
motionless
why
did
she
look
round
with
that
hurried
stealthy
glance
as
though
so
desirous
of
being
alone
presently
she
seemed
to
realize
that
she
stood
where
the
light
fell
brightest
and
she
turned
away
she
walked
to
the
side
of
the
pier
farthest
from
me
where
she
stood
opposite
to
the
bright
lights
of
the
western
pier
she
did
not
remain
there
long
but
crossed
again
and
this
time
she
chose
that
part
of
the
pier
where
i
was
sitting
far
back
in
the
deep
shade
in
the
corner
she
did
not
see
me
she
did
not
suspect
that
any
one
was
near
i
saw
her
give
a
hasty
look
down
the
pier
but
her
glance
never
fell
on
the
corner
where
i
sat
she
went
to
the
railings
one
or
two
of
them
were
broken
and
had
not
been
repaired
in
a
more
frequented
place
it
might
perhaps
have
been
dangerous
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
she
stood
for
some
minutes
in
silence
then
i
heard
again
bitter
weeping
passionate
sobs
sighs
i
heard
a
smothered
cry
of
oh
heaven
oh
heaven
have
pity
and
then
a
sickly
gleam
of
light
came
from
the
sky
and
by
its
light
i
saw
that
she
took
the
bundle
from
under
her
arm
i
could
not
see
what
it
was
or
what
it
held
but
she
bent
her
head
over
it
she
kissed
it
sobbed
over
it
with
passionate
sobs
then
raised
it
above
the
railings
and
let
it
fall
slowly
into
the
water
there
was
a
slight
splash
no
other
sound
as
she
raised
the
bundle
i
saw
distinctly
that
it
was
something
wrapped
in
a
gray
and
black
shawl
i
swear
before
heaven
that
no
thought
of
wrong
came
to
my
mind
i
never
dreamed
of
it
i
had
watched
her
first
because
the
rare
grace
of
her
tall
figure
and
of
her
walk
came
to
me
as
a
surprise
then
because
she
was
evidently
in
such
bitter
sorrow
then
because
she
seemed
so
desirous
of
being
alone
but
never
did
one
thought
cross
my
mind
that
there
was
a
shadow
of
blame
or
wrong
i
should
have
been
far
more
on
the
alert
had
i
thought
so
i
was
always
of
a
dreamy
sentimental
kind
of
mind
i
thought
of
nothing
more
than
a
woman
desperate
perhaps
with
an
unhappy
love
throwing
the
and
presents
of
a
faithless
lover
into
the
sea
nothing
more
i
repeat
this
most
emphatically
as
i
should
not
like
any
suspicion
of
indolence
or
indifference
to
rest
upon
me
a
slight
splash
not
of
anything
heavy
no
other
sound
no
cry
no
word
a
moment
pause
in
the
running
of
the
waves
then
they
went
on
again
as
gayly
as
ever
washing
the
wooden
pillars
and
wreathing
them
with
fresh
seaweed
the
tall
figure
with
the
head
bent
over
the
rail
might
have
been
a
statue
for
all
the
life
or
stir
there
was
within
her
quite
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
and
she
did
not
stir
i
began
to
wonder
if
she
were
dead
her
head
was
bent
the
whole
time
watching
the
waves
as
they
ran
hurrying
past
then
the
lady
moon
relented
and
showed
her
fair
face
again
a
flood
of
silver
fell
over
the
sea
each
wave
seemed
to
catch
some
of
it
and
break
with
a
thousand
ripples
of
light
the
white
cliffs
caught
it
it
fell
on
the
old
pier
and
the
tall
black
figure
stood
out
in
bold
relief
against
the
moonlit
sky
i
was
almost
startled
when
she
turned
round
and
i
saw
her
face
quite
plainly
the
same
light
that
revealed
her
pretty
little
face
and
figure
threw
a
deeper
shade
over
me
she
looked
anxiously
up
and
down
yet
by
a
singular
fatality
never
looked
at
the
corner
of
the
wooden
building
where
i
sat
i
have
often
wondered
since
that
i
did
not
cry
out
when
i
saw
that
face
so
wonderfully
beautiful
but
so
marble
white
so
sad
so
intent
so
earnest
the
beautiful
eyes
wild
with
pain
the
beautiful
mouth
quivering
i
can
see
it
now
and
i
shall
see
it
until
i
die
there
was
a
low
broad
brow
and
hair
clustered
on
it
hair
that
was
like
a
crown
the
face
was
exquisitely
beautiful
with
a
short
upper
lip
a
full
lovely
under
one
and
a
perfectly
modeled
chin
but
it
was
the
face
of
a
woman
almost
mad
with
despair
oh
heaven
if
i
dare
if
i
dare
she
cried
she
flung
up
her
hands
with
the
gesture
of
one
who
has
no
hope
she
looked
over
at
the
sea
once
more
at
the
pier
then
slowly
turned
away
and
again
quite
plainly
i
heard
the
words
oh
heaven
if
i
dare
if
i
dare
she
then
walked
slowly
away
and
i
lost
sight
of
her
under
the
silent
arches
but
i
could
not
forget
her
what
a
face
what
beauty
what
passion
what
pain
what
love
and
despair
what
goodness
and
power
what
a
face
when
should
i
ever
forget
it
impelled
by
curiosity
i
went
to
the
railings
and
i
stood
where
she
stood
i
looked
down
how
deep
and
fathomless
it
seemed
this
running
sea
what
was
it
she
had
dropped
there
in
my
mind
eye
i
saw
a
most
pathetic
little
bundle
made
of
i
pictured
them
tied
with
a
pretty
faded
ribbon
there
would
be
dried
flowers
each
one
a
momento
of
some
happy
occasion
i
could
fancy
the
dried
roses
the
withered
the
violets
with
some
faint
odor
lingering
still
around
them
then
there
would
be
a
valentine
perhaps
two
or
three
a
photograph
and
probably
an
engagement
ring
she
had
flung
them
away
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
only
heaven
knows
what
hopes
and
love
she
had
flung
with
them
i
could
understand
now
what
that
cry
meant
if
i
dare
if
i
dare
it
meant
that
if
she
dare
she
would
fling
herself
into
the
sea
after
them
how
many
hopes
had
been
flung
like
hers
into
those
black
depths
then
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
was
to
say
the
least
of
it
a
simpleton
to
waste
so
much
time
and
thought
about
another
affairs
i
remember
that
as
i
walked
slowly
down
the
pier
i
met
several
people
and
that
i
felt
a
glow
of
pleasure
at
the
thought
that
some
people
had
the
good
sense
to
prefer
the
chain
pier
and
then
i
went
home
a
game
at
billiards
a
long
chat
in
the
ought
to
have
distracted
my
mind
from
the
little
incident
i
had
witnessed
but
it
did
not
my
faced
the
sea
and
i
drew
up
the
blind
so
that
i
might
look
at
it
once
more
the
beautiful
sea
has
many
weird
aspects
none
stranger
than
when
it
lies
heaving
sullenly
under
the
light
of
the
moon
fascinated
charmed
i
stood
to
watch
it
the
moon
had
changed
her
mind
she
meant
to
shine
now
the
clouds
had
all
vanished
the
sky
was
dark
and
blue
the
stars
were
shining
but
the
wind
had
quickened
and
the
waves
rolled
in
briskly
with
white
silvery
foam
marking
their
progress
the
chain
pier
stood
out
quite
clear
and
distinct
in
the
moonlight
very
fair
and
shapely
it
looked
then
i
went
to
sleep
and
dreamed
of
the
white
beautiful
desperate
face
of
the
woman
who
had
i
believed
thrown
her
into
the
sea
the
wind
grew
rougher
and
the
sea
grew
angry
during
the
night
when
at
times
i
woke
from
my
sleep
i
could
hear
them
ah
long
before
this
the
had
been
destroyed
had
been
torn
by
the
swift
waves
the
faded
flowers
and
all
the
pretty
were
done
to
death
in
the
brisk
waters
i
wondered
if
in
thought
that
beautiful
desperate
woman
would
go
back
to
that
spot
on
the
chain
pier
the
morning
following
dawned
bright
and
calm
there
was
a
golden
sunlight
and
a
blue
sea
why
the
color
of
the
water
should
change
so
greatly
i
could
not
think
but
change
it
did
i
have
seen
it
clear
as
an
emerald
and
i
have
seen
it
blue
as
the
lakes
and
seas
of
italy
this
morning
it
wore
a
blue
dress
and
a
thousand
brilliants
danced
on
its
broad
sweet
bosom
already
there
were
a
number
of
people
on
the
promenade
both
piers
looked
beautiful
and
were
full
of
life
and
activity
it
must
have
been
some
kind
of
holiday
although
i
forget
for
what
the
flags
were
flying
and
there
was
a
holiday
look
about
the
town
i
thought
i
would
walk
for
ten
minutes
before
my
breakfast
i
went
toward
the
chain
pier
drawn
by
the
irresistible
attraction
of
the
face
i
had
seen
there
last
evening
it
struck
me
that
there
was
an
unusual
number
of
people
about
the
chain
pier
quite
a
crowd
had
collected
at
the
gate
people
were
talking
to
each
other
in
an
excited
fashion
i
saw
one
or
two
policemen
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
some
accident
or
other
had
happened
on
the
pier
i
went
up
to
the
crowd
two
or
three
boatmen
stood
leaning
over
the
rail
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
matter
sir
replied
one
there
is
matter
enough
there
must
have
been
murder
or
something
very
much
like
it
done
on
that
pier
last
night
murder
i
cried
with
a
beating
heart
do
not
use
such
a
horrible
word
it
is
a
horrible
thing
sir
but
it
has
been
done
replied
the
boatman
chapter
iii
why
the
word
murder
struck
me
with
such
a
horror
i
can
not
tell
i
stood
looking
at
the
old
boatman
like
one
struck
with
dismay
i
was
on
the
point
of
saying
that
it
was
quite
impossible
for
i
had
been
on
the
chain
pier
last
night
and
had
seen
nothing
of
the
kind
some
prudent
impulse
restrained
me
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
was
murder
interrupted
a
sturdy
boatman
i
have
been
about
here
a
great
many
years
and
i
have
seen
some
queer
things
i
should
hardly
call
this
murder
it
was
a
life
taken
away
whether
you
call
it
murder
or
not
said
the
old
man
may
be
but
i
am
not
sure
i
have
seen
many
mad
with
misery
but
murder
is
a
rare
thing
what
is
it
i
asked
a
child
sir
only
a
little
child
said
the
sturdy
boatman
the
body
of
a
little
child
found
drowned
off
the
pier
here
now
why
should
i
start
and
tremble
and
grow
sick
at
heart
what
had
it
to
do
with
me
i
knew
nothing
of
any
murdered
child
yet
great
drops
formed
on
my
brow
and
my
very
heart
trembled
a
little
child
found
drowned
i
repeated
but
how
do
you
know
it
was
murdered
it
may
have
fallen
into
the
water
it
was
not
old
enough
for
that
sir
said
the
elder
boatman
it
is
but
a
fair
little
mite
a
baby
girl
they
say
not
more
than
three
months
old
ah
why
did
the
beautiful
desperate
face
i
had
seen
the
night
before
flash
before
my
eyes
then
the
boatman
went
on
it
is
plain
to
my
eyes
that
it
is
a
murder
although
the
child
is
but
a
tender
babe
all
the
greater
murder
for
that
a
bigger
child
might
have
helped
itself
this
one
could
not
tell
me
about
it
i
said
ah
if
my
heart
would
but
stop
beating
or
if
the
beautiful
desperate
face
would
but
fade
from
my
memory
it
was
james
clayton
who
found
it
continued
the
old
man
he
was
at
work
in
the
jetty
this
morning
when
he
caught
sight
of
something
moving
up
and
down
with
the
waves
at
first
he
thought
it
looked
like
an
old
rag
and
he
took
no
notice
of
it
then
something
about
it
attracted
his
attention
more
and
more
he
went
nearer
and
found
that
it
was
a
gray
and
black
shawl
that
had
caught
on
some
large
hooks
which
had
been
driven
into
the
wooden
pillars
for
some
purpose
or
other
a
shawl
sure
as
could
be
some
lady
he
thought
had
dropped
it
over
the
pier
and
it
had
caught
on
these
hooks
below
the
water
jim
was
pleased
he
thought
if
worth
anything
he
might
get
a
trifle
reward
for
it
if
not
he
might
take
it
home
to
his
old
mother
he
took
his
boat
to
the
spot
but
sir
to
jim
surprise
he
found
it
was
not
only
a
shawl
but
a
bundle
he
thought
he
had
found
a
treasure
and
hastened
to
get
it
quickly
off
the
hooks
it
had
been
caught
more
tightly
by
accident
than
it
could
have
been
placed
there
by
human
hands
it
was
tight
on
the
hooks
and
he
had
to
tear
the
shawl
to
get
it
off
he
lost
no
time
opening
it
and
there
was
a
little
fair
child
drowned
and
dead
it
was
not
a
pleasant
sight
sir
on
a
bright
morning
when
the
sunshine
was
dancing
over
the
waves
jim
said
his
heart
turned
quite
faint
when
he
saw
the
little
white
body
such
a
fair
little
mite
sir
it
was
enough
to
make
the
very
angels
weep
some
woman
sir
heaven
forbid
that
it
was
the
mother
some
woman
had
dressed
it
in
pretty
white
clothes
it
had
a
white
gown
with
lace
and
a
soft
white
woolen
cap
on
the
little
golden
head
a
sorry
sight
sir
a
sorry
sight
jim
said
that
when
he
thought
of
that
little
tender
body
swinging
to
and
fro
with
the
waves
all
the
night
he
could
not
keep
the
tears
from
his
eyes
it
was
meant
to
sink
you
see
sir
continued
the
man
with
rough
energy
it
was
never
meant
to
be
caught
but
the
great
god
he
is
above
all
and
he
knows
the
little
one
was
not
to
sink
to
the
bottom
like
lead
it
is
true
sir
and
murder
will
out
but
is
nothing
known
i
asked
surely
such
a
thing
could
never
be
done
without
some
one
seeing
or
knowing
something
about
it
i
am
afraid
sir
no
one
knows
but
the
one
who
did
it
some
woman
sir
had
dressed
the
little
thing
a
man
would
never
have
thought
of
the
soft
woolen
cap
and
i
can
tell
you
another
thing
sir
a
man
would
never
have
killed
a
child
like
that
not
that
i
am
upholding
men
some
of
them
are
brutes
enough
but
i
do
not
think
any
man
would
throw
a
little
babe
into
the
water
when
a
woman
is
bad
she
is
bad
and
there
is
nothing
vile
enough
for
her
i
though
of
the
beautiful
and
desperate
face
heaven
grant
that
she
might
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
and
yet
the
black
and
gray
shawl
whereabouts
was
it
i
asked
he
pointed
with
his
hand
to
the
very
spot
where
she
had
stood
just
there
he
said
it
was
there
the
little
bundle
was
thrown
and
there
just
below
the
line
of
the
jetty
it
was
caught
by
the
hooks
the
identical
spot
where
she
had
stood
oh
beautiful
despairing
face
what
was
hidden
underneath
your
mask
of
stone
you
should
go
on
the
pier
sir
and
see
for
yourself
said
the
old
man
the
superintendent
of
the
police
is
there
now
but
they
will
never
find
out
who
did
that
women
are
deep
when
they
are
wicked
and
the
one
who
did
this
was
wicked
enough
there
was
a
slight
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
little
group
as
to
the
morning
being
a
dry
one
we
parted
on
very
satisfactory
terms
i
went
on
the
pier
and
under
the
wooden
shelter
where
i
had
sat
last
night
i
saw
a
group
the
superintendent
of
the
police
with
one
of
the
officers
the
manager
of
the
pier
the
keepers
of
the
different
stalls
a
few
strangers
and
jim
the
boatman
who
had
found
the
little
bundle
dripping
wet
oh
heaven
the
pathos
of
it
on
the
wooden
seat
lay
the
little
bundle
so
white
so
fair
like
a
small
pale
and
by
it
in
a
wet
heap
lay
the
black
and
gray
shawl
i
knew
it
in
one
moment
there
was
not
another
word
to
be
said
that
was
the
same
shawl
i
had
seen
in
the
woman
hands
when
she
dropped
the
little
bundle
into
the
sea
the
i
had
seen
it
plainly
by
the
bright
fitful
gleam
of
the
moon
the
superintendent
said
something
to
me
and
i
went
forward
to
look
at
the
little
child
so
small
so
fair
so
tender
how
could
any
woman
with
a
woman
heart
drop
that
warm
soft
little
nursling
into
the
cold
deep
sea
it
was
a
woman
who
killed
joel
a
woman
who
slew
holofernes
but
the
woman
who
drowned
this
little
tiny
child
was
more
cruel
by
far
than
they
what
a
sweet
little
face
said
the
superintendent
it
looks
just
as
though
it
were
made
of
wax
i
bent
forward
ah
if
i
had
doubted
before
i
could
doubt
no
longer
the
little
face
even
in
its
waxen
pallor
was
like
the
beautiful
one
i
had
seen
in
its
white
despair
last
night
just
the
same
cluster
of
hair
the
same
beautiful
mouth
and
molded
chin
mother
and
child
i
knew
and
felt
sure
the
little
white
garments
were
dripping
and
some
kind
motherly
woman
in
the
crowd
came
forward
and
dried
the
little
face
poor
little
thing
she
said
how
i
should
like
to
take
those
wet
things
off
and
make
it
warm
by
a
good
fire
it
will
never
be
warm
again
in
this
world
said
one
of
the
boatmen
there
is
but
little
chance
when
a
child
has
lain
all
night
in
the
sea
all
night
in
the
sea
said
the
pitiful
woman
and
my
children
lay
so
warm
and
comfortable
in
their
little
soft
beds
all
night
in
the
sea
poor
little
motherless
thing
she
seemed
to
take
it
quite
for
granted
that
the
child
must
be
motherless
in
her
loving
motherly
heart
she
could
not
think
of
such
a
crime
as
a
mother
destroying
her
own
child
i
saw
that
all
the
men
who
stood
round
the
body
were
struck
with
this
what
will
be
done
with
it
she
asked
it
will
go
to
the
at
the
said
the
superintendent
and
the
parish
will
bury
it
then
i
stood
forward
no
i
cried
if
the
authorities
will
permit
i
will
take
upon
myself
the
expense
of
burying
that
little
child
it
shall
not
have
a
funeral
it
shall
be
buried
in
the
beautiful
green
cemetery
in
the
lewes
road
and
it
shall
have
a
white
marble
cross
at
the
head
of
its
grave
you
are
very
good
sir
said
the
superintendent
and
the
pitiful
woman
cried
out
heaven
bless
you
sir
i
would
do
the
same
thing
myself
if
i
could
afford
it
there
must
be
an
inquest
said
some
one
in
the
crowd
we
ought
to
know
whether
the
child
was
dead
before
it
was
thrown
into
the
water
i
hope
to
heaven
it
was
cried
the
woman
and
i
said
to
myself
that
if
that
were
the
case
it
would
not
be
murder
not
murder
but
some
mad
miserable
mother
way
out
of
some
dreadful
difficulty
surely
on
the
beautiful
despairing
face
i
had
not
seen
the
brand
of
murder
if
the
little
one
had
been
dead
that
would
lessen
the
degree
of
wickedness
so
greatly
the
woman
who
had
dried
and
kissed
the
tiny
waxen
face
bent
over
it
now
i
am
sure
she
said
that
the
child
was
alive
when
it
touched
the
water
how
do
you
know
asked
the
superintendent
curiously
look
at
the
face
sir
and
you
will
see
i
see
nothing
he
replied
i
do
she
said
i
see
just
what
you
would
see
on
the
face
of
a
baby
suddenly
plunged
into
cold
water
i
see
the
signs
of
faint
baby
surprise
look
at
the
baby
brows
and
the
little
hand
spread
wide
open
it
was
living
when
it
touched
the
water
i
am
sure
of
that
a
doctor
will
soon
settle
that
question
said
the
superintendent
then
the
little
one
was
carried
by
rough
but
not
ungentle
hands
to
the
on
the
hill
i
went
with
it
i
overheard
the
superintendent
tell
the
master
of
the
that
i
was
a
rich
man
an
invalid
and
that
i
passed
a
great
deal
of
my
time
at
brighton
in
a
lowered
voice
he
added
that
i
was
very
eccentric
and
that
happening
to
be
on
the
chain
pier
that
morning
i
had
insisted
upon
paying
the
expenses
of
the
little
funeral
a
kind
christian
gentlemen
the
master
said
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
i
shall
never
forget
the
pitiful
sight
of
that
tiny
white
form
laid
on
the
table
alone
quite
alone
i
could
not
forget
it
the
matron
had
found
a
little
white
dress
to
wrap
it
in
and
with
kindly
thought
had
laid
some
white
chrysanthemums
on
the
little
innocent
breast
whenever
i
see
a
chrysanthemum
now
it
brings
back
to
my
mind
the
whole
scene
the
bare
white
walls
the
clean
wooden
floor
the
black
tressels
and
the
table
whereon
the
fair
tender
little
body
lay
all
alone
chapter
iv
our
little
life
in
this
world
seems
of
little
count
throw
a
stone
into
the
sea
it
makes
a
splash
that
lasts
for
one
second
then
it
is
all
over
the
waves
roll
on
just
as
though
it
had
not
been
dropped
the
death
of
this
one
little
child
whom
no
one
knew
and
for
whom
no
one
cared
was
of
less
than
no
account
it
made
a
small
paragraph
in
the
newspapers
it
had
caused
some
little
commotion
on
the
pier
just
a
little
hurry
at
the
and
then
it
was
forgotten
what
was
such
a
little
waif
and
stray
such
a
small
fair
tender
little
creature
to
the
gay
crowd
a
child
found
drowned
by
the
chain
pier
motherly
women
shrugged
their
shoulders
with
a
sigh
the
finding
or
the
death
of
such
hapless
little
ones
is
alas
not
rare
i
do
not
think
of
the
hundreds
who
carelessly
heard
the
words
that
morning
there
was
one
who
stopped
to
think
of
the
possible
suffering
of
the
child
it
is
a
wide
step
from
the
warmth
of
a
mother
arms
to
the
chill
of
the
water
the
gay
tide
of
fashion
ebbed
and
flowed
just
the
same
the
band
played
on
the
chain
pier
the
morning
following
the
sunbeams
danced
on
the
water
there
was
nothing
to
remind
one
of
the
little
life
so
suddenly
and
terribly
closed
there
was
not
much
more
to
tell
there
was
an
inquest
but
it
was
not
of
much
use
every
one
knew
that
the
child
had
been
drowned
the
doctor
thought
it
had
been
drugged
before
it
was
drowned
there
was
very
little
to
be
said
about
it
jim
the
boatman
proved
the
finding
of
it
the
coroner
said
a
few
civil
words
when
he
heard
that
one
of
the
visitors
of
the
town
out
of
sheer
pity
had
offered
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
little
funeral
the
little
unknown
babe
who
had
spent
the
night
in
the
deep
sea
was
buried
in
the
cemetery
on
the
lewes
road
i
bought
a
grave
for
her
under
the
spreading
boughs
of
a
tree
she
had
a
white
pall
and
a
quantity
of
white
flowers
the
matron
from
the
went
and
it
was
not
at
all
like
a
pauper
funeral
the
sun
was
shining
and
the
balmy
air
was
filled
with
the
song
of
birds
but
then
the
sun
does
shine
and
the
birds
will
sing
for
paupers
i
ordered
a
small
white
marble
cross
it
stands
underneath
the
trees
at
the
head
of
the
little
green
grove
when
the
head
mason
asked
me
what
name
was
to
be
put
upon
it
i
was
puzzled
only
heaven
knew
whether
the
helpless
little
child
had
a
claim
to
any
name
and
if
so
what
that
name
was
i
bethought
myself
of
one
name
it
meant
bitterness
of
deep
waters
i
will
call
it
i
said
and
the
name
stands
there
on
the
marble
cross
marah
aged
three
weeks
found
drowned
in
the
sea
september
only
one
small
grave
among
so
many
but
a
grave
over
which
no
mother
has
shed
a
tear
then
after
a
few
days
more
i
forgot
almost
all
about
it
yet
at
that
time
i
was
so
lonely
so
utterly
desolate
that
i
felt
some
kind
of
tie
bound
me
to
the
little
grave
and
made
me
love
the
spot
it
was
soon
all
forgotten
but
i
never
forgot
the
beautiful
despairing
face
i
had
seen
on
the
pier
that
night
the
face
that
seemed
to
have
passed
me
with
the
quickness
of
a
swift
wind
yet
which
was
impressed
on
my
brain
forever
i
have
been
writing
to
you
dear
reader
behind
a
veil
let
me
draw
it
aside
my
name
is
john
ford
by
no
means
a
romantic
name
but
i
come
of
a
good
family
i
am
one
of
the
world
unfortunates
i
had
neither
brother
nor
sister
my
father
and
mother
died
while
i
was
quite
young
they
left
me
a
large
fortune
but
no
relations
no
one
to
love
me
my
guardian
was
a
stern
grave
elderly
man
my
youth
was
lonely
my
manhood
more
lonely
still
i
found
a
fair
and
dainty
love
but
she
proved
false
she
left
me
for
one
who
had
more
gold
and
a
title
to
give
her
when
i
lost
her
all
my
happiness
died
the
only
consolation
i
found
was
going
about
from
place
to
place
trying
to
do
good
where
i
could
this
little
incident
on
the
chain
pier
aroused
me
more
than
anything
had
done
for
some
time
i
had
one
comfort
in
life
a
friend
whom
i
loved
dearer
than
a
brother
lancelot
fleming
and
lately
he
had
come
into
possession
of
a
very
nice
estate
called
dutton
manor
a
fine
old
mansion
standing
in
the
midst
of
an
extensive
park
and
with
it
an
income
of
three
thousand
per
annum
lance
fleming
had
been
brought
up
to
the
bar
but
he
never
cared
much
for
his
profession
and
was
much
pleased
when
he
succeeded
to
his
cousin
estate
he
had
invited
me
several
times
to
visit
dutton
manor
but
something
or
other
had
always
intervened
to
prevent
it
lance
came
to
see
me
we
traveled
together
we
were
the
very
opposite
of
each
other
he
was
frank
gay
cheerful
always
laughing
always
with
some
grand
jest
on
the
tapis
a
laughing
sunny
fellow
who
was
like
a
sunbeam
in
every
house
he
entered
he
was
always
either
whistling
or
singing
and
his
bright
cheery
voice
trolled
out
such
snatches
of
sweet
song
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
hear
him
i
am
naturally
melancholy
and
have
a
tendency
to
look
always
on
the
dark
side
of
things
you
can
imagine
how
i
loved
lance
fleming
the
love
that
other
men
give
to
wives
children
parents
and
relatives
i
lavished
on
him
i
loved
his
fair
handsome
face
his
laughing
blue
eyes
his
sunny
smile
his
cheery
voice
i
loved
his
genial
manner
in
fact
i
loved
the
whole
man
just
as
he
was
with
a
love
passing
that
of
women
loved
him
as
i
shall
love
no
other
naturally
enough
lance
was
a
great
favorite
with
the
ladies
every
woman
who
saw
him
loved
him
more
or
less
he
was
quite
irresistible
when
in
addition
to
his
handsome
face
and
sweet
temper
came
the
charm
of
being
master
of
a
grand
old
with
three
thousand
per
annum
no
wonder
that
he
was
popular
the
only
thing
which
troubled
me
about
lance
was
his
marriage
i
always
feared
it
with
his
gay
passionate
temperament
his
universal
admiration
and
chivalrous
manner
of
treating
the
fair
sex
it
was
certain
that
he
would
sooner
or
later
fall
in
love
and
marry
from
what
i
knew
of
him
from
the
innate
conviction
of
my
own
love
i
felt
sure
that
his
marriage
would
be
the
hinge
on
which
his
whole
life
would
turn
i
was
very
anxious
about
it
and
talked
to
him
a
great
deal
about
it
when
we
were
together
if
you
marry
the
right
woman
lance
i
said
to
him
you
will
be
one
of
the
happiest
and
most
successful
men
in
the
world
but
if
you
should
make
a
mistake
you
will
be
one
of
the
most
miserable
i
shall
make
no
mistake
john
i
know
that
somewhere
or
other
the
most
adorable
woman
in
the
whole
world
is
waiting
for
me
i
shall
be
sure
to
find
her
and
fall
in
love
with
her
marry
her
and
live
happy
forever
afterward
but
you
will
be
careful
lance
i
said
as
careful
as
a
man
can
be
but
john
as
you
are
so
anxious
you
had
better
choose
for
me
no
i
replied
i
made
so
great
a
mistake
when
i
had
to
choose
for
myself
that
i
shall
never
attempt
it
again
circumstances
happened
that
drew
me
over
to
america
i
had
a
large
interest
in
some
land
there
and
not
caring
about
the
trouble
of
it
i
went
over
to
sell
it
i
succeeded
in
selling
it
to
great
profit
and
as
i
liked
america
i
remained
there
three
years
i
sailed
for
america
in
the
month
of
october
two
or
three
weeks
after
the
incident
of
the
chain
pier
and
i
returned
to
england
after
an
absence
of
three
years
and
seven
months
i
found
myself
at
home
again
when
the
lovely
month
of
may
was
at
its
fairest
during
all
that
time
only
one
incident
of
any
note
happened
to
me
or
rather
happened
that
interested
me
lance
fleming
was
married
he
wrote
whole
volumes
to
me
before
his
marriage
and
he
wrote
whole
volumes
afterwards
of
course
she
was
perfection
nay
just
a
little
beyond
perfection
i
think
she
was
beautiful
clever
accomplished
and
such
a
darling
of
course
i
might
be
sure
of
that
one
thing
only
was
wanted
to
make
him
perfectly
happy
it
was
that
i
should
see
his
her
name
was
frances
wynn
and
he
assured
me
that
it
was
the
most
poetical
name
in
the
world
page
after
page
of
rhapsody
did
he
write
and
i
read
until
at
last
i
believed
him
that
he
had
found
the
one
perfect
woman
in
the
world
lance
wrote
oftener
still
when
i
told
him
that
i
was
coming
home
i
must
go
at
once
to
dutton
manor
i
should
find
dutton
manor
an
earthly
paradise
he
said
and
he
was
doubly
delighted
that
i
should
be
there
in
may
for
in
may
it
wore
its
fairest
aspect
a
wife
makes
home
heaven
john
he
never
tired
of
writing
i
wonder
often
why
heaven
has
blessed
me
so
greatly
my
wife
is
well
i
worship
her
she
is
a
proud
woman
calm
fair
and
lovely
as
a
saint
you
will
never
know
how
much
i
love
her
until
you
have
seen
her
she
fills
the
old
with
sunshine
and
music
i
love
to
hear
the
gentle
sound
of
her
voice
sweet
and
low
as
the
sound
of
a
lute
the
of
her
dress
as
she
moves
about
i
am
even
more
in
love
with
her
than
when
i
married
her
and
i
should
not
have
thought
that
possible
make
haste
home
john
my
dear
old
friend
even
my
happy
home
is
incomplete
without
you
come
and
share
its
brightness
with
me
he
wrote
innumerable
directions
for
my
journey
the
nearest
railway
station
to
dutton
manor
was
at
vale
royal
a
pretty
little
town
about
three
miles
from
the
house
if
i
would
let
him
know
by
what
train
i
should
reach
vale
royal
he
would
be
at
the
station
to
meet
me
and
he
said
heaven
bless
his
dear
loving
heart
that
he
was
looking
forward
to
it
with
untold
happiness
when
i
think
of
seeing
frances
and
you
together
he
said
i
feel
like
a
out
for
a
holiday
i
will
count
the
hours
john
until
you
come
i
had
to
go
to
london
on
business
and
while
there
it
was
impossible
to
resist
the
temptation
of
running
on
to
brighton
i
loved
the
place
so
well
and
i
had
not
seen
it
for
so
long
i
wanted
to
stand
once
more
on
the
chain
pier
and
think
of
my
lost
heaven
how
vividly
it
all
came
back
to
me
that
terrible
tragedy
although
more
than
three
years
had
passed
since
it
happened
there
was
the
corner
where
i
had
sat
in
the
thick
soft
shadows
there
was
the
railing
against
which
she
leaned
when
she
threw
the
little
bundle
in
the
water
i
remembered
the
fitful
light
the
wash
of
the
waves
round
the
pier
the
beautiful
desperate
face
and
the
voice
that
had
wailed
if
i
dare
oh
my
god
if
i
dare
i
went
to
see
the
little
grave
the
thick
green
grass
which
covered
is
was
studded
with
white
daisies
the
golden
letters
on
the
white
cross
seemed
to
burn
in
the
sunlight
marah
found
drowned
i
had
been
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
but
no
one
had
been
to
shed
a
tear
over
the
little
grave
chapter
the
face
of
an
old
friend
is
good
to
see
after
a
long
absence
tears
filled
my
eyes
when
the
sunny
blue
ones
looked
into
them
and
the
handsome
face
quivering
with
emotion
smiled
into
mine
i
was
glad
to
feel
once
more
the
clasp
of
that
honest
hand
ah
lance
i
cried
i
would
travel
twice
as
far
for
one
hour
with
you
i
shall
never
forget
that
pretty
station
at
vale
royal
a
beautiful
brawling
river
ran
close
by
spanned
by
an
rustic
bridge
three
huge
chestnut
trees
now
in
full
flower
seemed
to
shade
the
whole
place
a
pretty
spot
said
proud
happy
lance
but
wait
till
you
see
dutton
i
tell
frances
that
i
am
quite
sure
it
is
the
original
garden
of
paradise
let
us
pray
that
no
serpent
may
enter
therein
i
said
there
is
no
fear
john
he
replied
my
frances
would
be
an
antidote
against
all
the
serpents
in
the
world
we
shall
have
a
glorious
drive
home
how
do
you
like
my
carriage
it
was
perfect
so
were
the
horses
so
was
the
groom
in
his
neat
livery
so
was
the
dogcart
waiting
for
the
luggage
so
was
the
magnificent
retriever
that
ran
with
the
carriage
what
a
drive
it
was
of
all
seasons
in
all
climes
give
me
an
english
spring
the
hedges
were
covered
with
white
and
pink
hawthorn
the
apple
trees
were
all
in
bloom
the
air
was
redolent
of
mariets
the
white
lambs
were
in
the
meadows
the
leaves
were
springing
on
the
trees
the
birds
singing
it
is
like
a
new
life
john
said
the
happy
young
fellow
by
my
side
then
quite
unable
to
keep
his
thoughts
or
his
words
long
away
from
her
he
continued
frances
will
be
so
pleased
to
see
you
we
have
talked
of
nothing
else
for
a
week
i
am
afraid
that
she
will
be
disappointed
when
she
sees
me
lance
no
indeed
he
replied
heartily
you
look
better
than
you
did
when
you
went
to
america
john
you
look
younger
less
haggard
less
worn
perhaps
you
have
found
some
comfort
not
of
the
kind
you
mean
lance
i
answered
and
i
never
shall
ah
he
said
musingly
what
mischief
one
bad
woman
can
make
and
she
was
a
bad
woman
this
false
love
of
yours
john
if
she
had
been
a
good
one
she
would
have
been
true
i
replied
i
think
said
lance
musingly
that
in
all
this
world
there
is
nothing
so
horrible
as
a
bad
a
really
bad
or
wicked
woman
they
seem
to
me
much
worse
than
men
just
as
a
good
woman
is
better
than
a
man
could
ever
be
is
little
less
than
an
angel
do
you
know
he
continued
his
voice
trembling
with
emotion
i
did
not
understand
how
good
a
woman
could
be
my
wife
frances
is
quite
an
angel
when
i
see
her
in
the
morning
her
fair
face
so
fresh
and
pure
kneeling
down
to
say
her
prayers
i
feel
quite
unworthy
of
her
when
i
see
the
rapt
earnest
expression
of
her
face
as
we
sit
side
by
side
in
church
i
long
to
be
like
her
she
is
one
of
the
gentlest
and
sweetest
of
women
there
is
no
one
like
her
i
am
heartily
glad
that
you
are
so
happy
my
dearest
lance
i
said
he
continued
i
know
that
my
talking
does
not
bore
you
you
are
too
true
a
friend
it
eases
my
heart
for
it
is
always
full
of
her
you
do
not
know
how
good
she
is
why
john
the
soul
of
a
good
woman
is
clear
and
transparent
like
a
deep
clear
lake
and
in
it
one
sees
such
beautiful
things
when
my
frances
speaks
to
a
little
child
there
comes
into
her
voice
a
beautiful
tenderness
a
ring
of
such
clear
music
that
i
say
to
myself
it
is
more
like
the
voice
of
an
angel
than
of
a
woman
it
is
just
the
same
when
she
speaks
to
any
one
in
sorrow
or
sickness
the
strange
thing
to
me
is
this
that
though
she
is
so
good
herself
so
pure
and
innocent
she
has
such
profound
compassion
for
the
fallen
and
the
miserable
at
vale
royal
only
a
few
months
ago
there
was
one
of
those
unfortunate
cases
a
poor
a
very
pretty
and
nice
girl
too
she
was
was
turned
out
of
her
mistress
house
in
the
cold
of
a
winter
night
her
boxes
and
wages
were
put
in
the
street
and
she
was
told
to
go
to
the
she
almost
went
mad
with
despair
and
shame
frances
would
go
to
the
rescue
and
i
honestly
believe
that
through
my
wife
charity
and
goodness
that
unhappy
girl
will
be
restored
to
her
place
in
the
world
or
that
at
least
she
will
not
go
as
she
would
otherwise
have
done
to
the
bad
i
thought
that
a
most
beautiful
trait
in
her
character
so
it
was
i
replied
liking
my
dear
old
friend
all
the
better
for
his
great
love
for
his
wife
she
is
always
the
same
he
continued
full
of
charity
and
tenderness
for
the
poor
you
could
not
think
how
much
they
love
her
all
around
vale
royal
she
is
worshiped
i
am
a
very
fortunate
man
john
you
are
indeed
i
replied
he
went
on
i
always
had
my
ideal
i
have
known
many
none
ever
reached
my
standard
but
frances
and
she
is
my
ideal
come
to
life
the
reality
found
fair
sweet
and
true
a
blonde
queenly
woman
i
should
think
that
very
few
men
meet
and
marry
their
ideal
as
i
have
met
and
married
mine
ah
there
is
the
avenue
that
leads
to
the
old
who
could
have
thought
that
i
should
ever
be
master
of
a
john
neither
that
nor
the
handsome
income
belonging
to
it
would
be
of
any
use
without
frances
it
is
frances
who
makes
the
world
to
me
the
avenue
was
a
superb
one
it
consisted
of
tall
chestnut
trees
standing
four
deep
i
have
seen
nothing
finer
just
now
the
flowers
were
all
in
bloom
the
bees
and
butterflies
had
been
all
drawn
there
by
their
odor
the
birds
were
flitting
in
and
out
making
grand
discoveries
in
the
great
boughs
the
ground
was
a
carpet
of
flowers
white
daisies
and
golden
buttercups
mixed
with
wild
hyacinths
and
graceful
we
drove
for
some
few
minutes
over
this
carpet
and
then
the
old
gray
stood
before
us
the
prettiest
picture
ever
seen
on
a
summer
day
the
whole
front
of
the
house
was
covered
with
flowers
and
the
ivy
grew
green
and
thick
it
climbed
to
the
very
top
of
the
towers
famous
ivy
said
lance
people
come
to
dutton
to
look
at
the
ivy
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
i
said
i
was
somewhat
surprised
at
the
style
o
the
house
i
had
not
expected
anything
so
grand
so
beautiful
we
shall
have
time
for
a
cigar
and
a
stroll
before
dinner
said
lance
as
he
threw
the
reins
to
the
groom
but
you
must
see
frances
first
john
you
must
see
her
but
one
of
the
servants
told
us
that
fleming
was
in
the
engaged
with
lady
ledbitter
lance
face
fell
you
do
not
seem
to
care
for
lady
ledbitter
i
said
to
him
in
truth
i
do
not
she
is
a
county
magnate
and
a
local
horror
i
call
her
she
leads
all
the
ladies
of
the
country
they
are
frightened
to
death
of
her
they
frown
when
she
frowns
smile
when
she
smiles
i
begged
of
frances
not
to
fall
under
her
sway
but
i
have
begged
in
vain
no
doubt
if
she
has
been
there
for
half
and
hour
frances
will
have
given
in
he
turned
on
me
suddenly
so
suddenly
indeed
that
he
almost
startled
me
do
you
know
he
said
those
kind
of
women
fair
and
calm
whose
thoughts
seem
to
be
always
turned
inward
my
wife
is
one
of
those
when
one
talks
to
her
she
listens
with
her
eyes
down
and
seems
as
though
she
had
left
another
world
of
thought
just
for
your
sake
her
manner
always
piques
one
to
go
on
talking
for
the
sake
of
making
her
smile
i
can
just
imagine
how
she
looks
now
while
lady
ledbitter
talks
to
her
well
come
to
your
own
room
john
and
we
will
stroll
round
the
grounds
until
her
ladyship
has
retreated
what
a
beautiful
old
house
it
was
one
could
tell
so
easily
that
a
lady
of
taste
and
refinement
presided
over
it
the
fine
old
oak
was
not
covered
but
contrasting
with
it
were
thick
crimson
rugs
hangings
of
crimson
velvet
and
it
was
relieved
by
any
amount
of
flowers
beautiful
pictures
were
hung
with
exquisite
taste
white
statues
stood
out
in
grand
relief
against
the
dark
walls
your
wife
is
a
woman
of
taste
that
is
quite
evident
lance
i
said
my
own
room
a
spacious
chamber
called
the
blue
chamber
a
large
room
with
three
windows
each
window
seat
as
large
as
a
small
room
the
hangings
were
of
blue
and
white
there
were
a
few
jardinieres
with
costly
odorous
flowers
easy
chairs
a
comfortable
couch
little
stands
had
been
placed
with
easy
chairs
in
the
window
seats
the
room
looked
as
though
bluebells
had
been
strewn
with
a
liberal
hand
on
white
ground
how
beautiful
i
cried
i
shall
never
want
to
leave
this
room
again
lance
i
wish
you
would
stay
and
never
leave
us
i
am
happy
enough
in
having
frances
if
i
had
you
as
well
my
happiness
would
be
complete
you
have
all
you
want
john
i
will
send
your
portmanteau
when
lance
had
gone
i
looked
round
my
room
and
fell
in
love
with
it
it
had
the
charm
of
old
fashion
of
elegance
of
space
of
height
and
from
the
windows
there
was
a
magnificent
view
of
the
park
and
the
gardens
lance
must
indeed
be
a
happy
man
i
thought
to
myself
he
came
to
me
when
i
was
dressed
and
we
went
out
for
a
stroll
through
the
gardens
we
shall
hear
the
said
lance
we
will
not
go
too
far
we
saw
the
stately
equipage
of
lady
ledbitter
driven
down
the
avenue
thank
heaven
said
lance
now
frances
is
free
she
will
have
gone
to
her
room
that
good
lady
ledbitter
has
robbed
us
of
a
pleasant
hour
i
was
surprised
and
delighted
at
the
magnificence
of
the
grounds
i
had
never
dreamed
that
dutton
was
so
extensive
or
so
beautiful
the
great
artist
lilias
is
coming
here
next
week
said
lance
i
want
him
to
paint
my
wife
portrait
she
will
make
a
superb
picture
and
when
completed
that
picture
shall
have
the
place
of
honor
here
in
the
you
will
enjoy
meeting
him
he
is
a
most
intelligent
amiable
man
that
good
lance
it
seemed
to
me
quite
impossible
that
he
could
speak
even
these
words
without
bringing
in
frances
but
how
bright
and
happy
he
looked
i
envied
him
do
as
i
have
done
john
he
said
marry
believe
me
no
man
knows
what
happiness
means
until
he
does
marry
you
must
find
me
a
wife
just
like
your
own
i
said
and
the
words
came
back
to
me
afterward
with
a
fervent
prayer
of
heaven
forbid
may
heaven
forbid
i
shall
never
marry
now
lance
i
said
the
only
woman
i
could
ever
love
is
dead
to
me
he
looked
at
me
very
earnestly
i
wish
you
would
forget
all
about
her
john
she
was
not
worthy
of
you
perhaps
not
i
replied
but
that
does
not
interfere
with
the
love
why
should
you
give
all
that
loving
heart
of
yours
to
one
woman
john
he
said
if
one
fails
try
another
if
your
frances
died
should
you
love
another
woman
i
asked
that
is
quite
another
thing
he
said
and
i
saw
in
his
heart
he
resented
the
fact
that
i
should
place
the
woman
who
had
been
faithless
to
me
on
an
equality
with
his
wife
poor
lance
chapter
vi
as
we
drew
near
the
house
on
our
return
the
first
was
ringing
we
have
twenty
minutes
yet
said
lance
you
will
just
have
time
to
say
a
few
words
to
frances
she
is
sure
to
be
in
the
we
went
there
when
the
door
was
opened
i
saw
a
magnificent
room
long
lofty
and
bright
so
cheerful
and
light
with
such
beautiful
furniture
and
such
superb
hangings
of
white
and
gold
i
was
struck
as
i
had
never
been
by
any
room
before
the
long
french
windows
opening
like
glass
doors
looked
over
a
superb
where
flowers
of
every
hue
were
now
in
blossom
the
room
was
full
of
sunlight
it
faced
the
west
and
the
sun
was
setting
for
a
few
moments
my
eyes
were
dazzled
then
as
the
golden
haze
cleared
i
saw
a
tall
figure
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
a
beautiful
figure
dressed
in
a
long
robe
of
blue
with
a
crown
of
golden
brown
hair
when
she
turned
suddenly
to
us
i
saw
that
she
carried
some
sprays
of
white
hawthorn
in
her
hand
at
first
my
attention
was
concentrated
on
the
golden
hair
the
blue
dress
the
white
flowers
then
slowly
as
though
following
some
irresistible
magnetic
attraction
my
eyes
were
raised
to
her
face
and
remained
fixed
there
i
have
wondered
a
thousand
times
since
how
it
was
that
no
cry
escaped
my
lips
how
it
was
that
none
of
the
cold
sick
horror
that
filled
my
whole
heart
and
soul
did
not
find
vent
in
words
how
was
it
to
this
moment
i
can
not
tell
great
heaven
what
did
i
see
in
this
beloved
and
worshiped
wife
in
this
fair
and
queenly
woman
in
this
tender
and
charitable
lady
who
was
so
good
to
the
fallen
and
miserable
in
this
woman
idolized
by
the
man
i
loved
best
upon
earth
i
saw
the
murderess
the
woman
who
had
dropped
the
little
bundle
over
the
railing
into
the
sea
it
was
she
as
surely
as
heaven
shone
above
us
i
recognized
the
beautiful
face
the
light
golden
hair
the
tall
graceful
figure
the
face
was
not
white
set
desperate
now
but
bright
with
a
soft
sweet
radiance
i
have
seen
on
the
face
of
no
other
woman
living
for
an
instant
my
whole
heart
was
paralyzed
with
horror
i
felt
my
blood
grow
cold
and
gather
round
my
heart
leaving
my
face
and
hands
cold
she
came
forward
to
greet
me
with
the
same
graceful
undulating
grace
which
had
struck
me
before
for
a
moment
i
was
back
on
the
chain
pier
with
the
wild
waste
of
waters
around
me
and
the
rapid
rush
of
the
waves
in
my
ear
then
a
beautiful
face
was
smiling
into
mine
a
white
hand
on
which
rich
jewels
shone
was
held
out
to
me
a
voice
sweeter
than
any
music
i
had
ever
heard
said
you
are
welcome
to
dutton
ford
my
husband
will
be
completely
happy
now
great
heaven
how
could
this
woman
be
a
murderess
the
beautiful
face
the
clear
limpid
eyes
how
could
it
be
no
sweeter
mouth
ever
smiled
and
the
light
that
lay
on
her
face
was
the
light
of
heaven
itself
how
could
it
be
she
seemed
to
wonder
a
little
at
my
coldness
for
she
added
i
can
not
tell
you
how
pleased
i
am
to
see
you
and
lance
has
thought
of
nothing
else
during
the
last
week
i
wonder
that
i
did
cry
out
you
are
the
woman
who
drowned
the
little
child
off
the
chain
pier
it
was
only
the
sight
of
lance
face
that
deterred
me
i
had
some
vague
indistinct
notion
of
what
those
words
would
be
to
him
what
is
the
matter
john
asked
lance
impatiently
the
sight
of
my
wife
face
seems
to
have
struck
you
dumb
it
must
be
with
admiration
then
i
said
making
a
desperate
effort
to
recover
myself
i
could
almost
think
i
had
seen
fleming
face
before
she
looked
at
me
frankly
and
she
laughed
frankly
i
have
a
good
memory
for
faces
she
said
and
i
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
yours
there
was
no
shadow
of
fear
or
of
any
effect
at
concealment
she
did
not
change
color
or
shrink
from
me
lance
laughed
aloud
i
wonder
no
longer
at
your
being
a
bachelor
he
said
if
the
sight
of
a
beautiful
face
produces
such
a
strange
effect
on
you
you
must
deal
gently
with
him
frances
he
said
to
his
wife
his
nerves
are
weak
he
can
not
bear
much
at
a
time
i
promise
to
be
very
gentle
she
said
and
the
music
of
that
low
caressing
voice
thrilled
my
very
heart
i
think
she
continued
that
ford
looks
very
tired
lance
pale
and
worn
we
must
take
great
care
of
him
that
we
will
was
the
hearty
reply
great
heaven
was
it
a
murderess
standing
there
with
that
sweet
look
of
compassion
on
her
beautiful
face
could
this
woman
who
looked
pitifully
on
me
a
grown
man
drown
a
little
child
in
the
deep
sea
were
those
lips
littering
kindly
words
of
welcome
the
same
that
had
cried
in
mad
despair
oh
heaven
if
i
dare
if
i
dare
i
could
have
killed
myself
for
the
base
suspicion
yet
it
was
most
surely
she
i
stooped
to
pick
up
the
white
hawthorn
she
had
dropped
she
took
it
from
me
with
the
sweetest
smile
and
lance
stood
by
looking
on
with
an
air
of
proud
proprietorship
that
would
have
been
amusing
if
it
had
not
been
so
unutterably
pitiful
while
my
brain
and
mind
were
still
chaos
a
whirl
of
thought
and
emotion
the
second
rang
i
offered
her
my
arm
but
i
could
not
refrain
from
a
shudder
as
her
white
hand
touched
it
when
i
saw
that
hand
last
it
was
most
assuredly
dropping
the
little
burden
into
the
sea
lance
looked
at
us
most
ruefully
so
that
she
laughed
and
said
come
with
us
lance
she
laid
her
other
hand
on
his
arm
and
we
all
three
walked
into
the
together
i
could
not
eat
any
dinner
i
could
only
sit
and
watch
the
beautiful
face
it
was
the
face
of
a
good
woman
there
was
nothing
cruel
nothing
subtle
in
it
i
must
be
mistaken
i
felt
as
though
i
should
go
mad
she
was
a
perfect
hostess
most
attentive
most
graceful
i
shall
never
forget
her
kindness
to
me
any
more
than
i
shall
forget
the
comeliness
of
her
face
or
the
gleam
of
her
golden
hair
she
thought
i
was
not
well
she
did
not
know
that
it
was
fear
which
had
blanched
my
face
and
made
me
tremble
she
could
not
tell
that
it
was
horror
which
curdled
my
blood
without
any
fuss
she
was
so
anxiously
considerate
for
me
without
seeming
to
make
any
ceremony
she
was
so
gracefully
kind
she
would
not
let
me
sit
in
the
draughts
with
her
own
hands
she
selected
some
purple
grapes
for
me
this
could
never
be
the
woman
who
had
drowned
a
little
child
when
dinner
was
over
and
we
were
in
the
again
she
drew
a
chair
near
the
fire
for
me
you
will
laugh
at
the
notion
of
a
fire
in
may
she
said
but
i
find
the
early
summer
evenings
chilly
and
i
can
not
bear
the
cold
i
wondered
if
she
thought
of
the
chill
of
the
water
in
which
she
had
plunged
the
little
child
i
looked
at
her
there
was
not
even
a
fleeting
shadow
on
her
face
then
she
lingered
for
half
a
minute
by
my
side
as
she
drew
near
to
me
i
felt
again
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
that
my
suspicions
could
be
correct
and
that
i
must
be
mistaken
i
hope
she
said
you
will
not
think
what
i
am
going
to
say
strange
i
know
that
it
is
the
custom
for
some
wives
to
be
jealous
of
their
husband
friends
some
might
be
jealous
of
you
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
am
not
one
of
that
kind
i
love
my
husband
so
utterly
so
entirely
that
all
whom
he
loves
are
dear
to
me
you
are
a
brother
friend
everything
to
him
will
you
be
the
same
to
me
a
beautiful
woman
asking
with
those
sweet
sensitive
lips
for
my
friendship
looking
at
me
with
those
calm
tender
eyes
asking
me
to
like
her
for
her
husband
sake
the
sweetest
the
most
gracious
the
most
graceful
picture
i
had
ever
seen
yet
oh
heaven
a
murderess
if
ever
there
was
one
she
wondered
why
i
did
not
respond
to
her
advances
i
read
the
wonder
in
her
face
you
do
not
care
for
hasty
friends
she
said
well
lance
and
i
are
one
if
you
like
him
you
must
like
me
and
time
will
show
you
are
more
than
good
to
me
i
stammered
thinking
in
my
heart
if
she
had
been
but
half
as
good
to
the
little
helpless
child
she
flung
into
the
sea
i
have
never
seen
a
woman
more
charming
of
more
exquisite
grace
of
more
perfect
accomplishment
greater
fascination
of
manner
she
sang
to
us
and
her
voice
was
full
of
such
sweet
pathos
it
almost
brought
the
tears
in
my
eyes
i
could
not
reconcile
what
i
saw
now
with
what
i
had
seen
on
the
chain
pier
though
outwardly
the
same
woman
i
had
seen
on
the
chain
pier
and
this
graceful
gracious
lady
could
not
possibly
be
one
as
the
evening
passed
on
and
i
saw
her
bright
cheerful
ways
her
devotion
to
her
husband
her
candid
frank
open
manner
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
must
be
the
victim
either
of
a
mania
or
of
some
terrible
mistake
was
it
possible
though
that
i
could
have
been
had
i
not
had
the
face
clearly
distinctly
before
me
for
the
past
three
years
one
thing
struck
me
during
the
evening
watching
her
most
narrowly
i
could
not
see
in
her
any
of
feeling
she
seemed
to
think
what
she
said
and
to
say
just
what
she
thought
there
were
no
musings
no
reveries
no
fits
of
abstraction
such
as
one
would
think
would
go
always
with
sin
or
crime
her
attention
was
given
always
to
what
was
passing
she
was
not
in
the
least
like
a
person
with
anything
weighing
on
her
mind
we
were
talking
lance
and
i
of
an
old
friend
of
ours
who
had
gone
to
nice
and
that
led
to
a
digression
on
the
different
watering
places
of
england
lance
mentioned
several
the
climate
of
which
he
declared
was
unsurpassed
those
mysterious
places
of
which
one
reads
in
the
papers
where
violets
grow
in
december
and
the
sun
shines
all
the
year
round
i
can
not
remember
who
first
named
brighton
but
i
do
remember
that
she
neither
changed
color
nor
shrank
now
for
a
test
i
said
to
myself
i
looked
at
her
straight
in
the
face
so
that
no
expression
of
hers
could
escape
me
no
shadow
pass
over
her
eyes
unknown
to
me
do
you
know
brighton
at
all
i
asked
her
i
could
see
to
the
very
depths
of
those
limpid
eyes
no
shadow
came
the
beautiful
attentive
face
did
not
change
in
the
least
she
smiled
as
she
replied
i
do
not
i
know
bournemouth
and
eastbourne
very
well
i
like
bournemouth
best
we
had
hardly
touched
upon
the
subject
and
she
had
glided
from
it
yet
with
such
seeming
unconsciousness
i
laughed
yet
i
felt
that
my
lips
were
stiff
and
the
sound
of
my
voice
strange
every
one
knows
brighton
i
said
it
is
not
often
one
meets
an
english
lady
who
does
not
know
it
she
looked
at
me
with
the
most
charming
and
frank
directness
i
spent
a
few
hours
there
once
she
said
from
the
little
i
saw
of
it
i
took
it
for
a
city
of
palaces
it
is
a
beautiful
place
i
said
she
rose
with
languid
grace
and
went
to
the
table
i
think
i
will
ring
for
some
tea
she
said
i
am
chill
and
cold
in
spite
of
the
fire
ford
will
you
join
me
chapter
vii
my
feelings
when
i
reached
my
room
that
night
were
not
to
be
envied
i
was
as
firmly
convinced
of
the
identity
of
the
woman
as
i
was
of
the
shining
of
the
sun
there
could
not
be
any
mistake
i
had
seen
her
face
quite
plainly
in
the
moonlight
and
it
had
been
too
deeply
impressed
on
my
mind
for
me
to
forget
it
or
to
mistake
it
for
another
indeed
the
horror
of
the
discovery
was
still
upon
me
my
nerves
were
trembling
my
blood
was
cold
how
could
it
be
that
my
old
friend
lance
had
made
so
terrible
a
mistake
how
could
i
bear
to
know
that
the
wife
whom
he
worshiped
was
a
murderess
what
else
she
had
been
i
did
not
care
even
to
think
whose
child
it
was
or
why
she
had
drowned
it
i
could
not
dare
not
think
i
could
not
sleep
or
rest
my
mind
and
brain
were
at
variance
with
themselves
frances
fleming
seemed
to
me
a
fair
loving
woman
graceful
as
fair
the
woman
i
had
seen
on
the
chain
pier
was
a
wild
desperate
creature
capable
of
anything
i
could
not
rest
the
soft
bed
of
eiderdown
the
sheets
of
pure
linen
perfumed
with
lavender
the
pillows
soft
as
though
filled
with
down
from
the
wings
of
a
bird
could
bring
no
rest
to
me
if
this
woman
were
anything
but
what
she
seemed
to
be
if
she
were
indeed
a
murderess
how
dare
she
deceive
lance
fleming
was
it
right
just
or
fair
that
he
should
give
the
love
of
his
honest
heart
the
devotion
of
his
life
to
a
woman
who
ought
to
have
been
branded
i
wished
a
thousand
times
over
that
i
had
never
seen
the
chain
pier
or
that
i
had
never
come
to
dutton
manor
house
yet
it
might
be
that
i
was
the
humble
instrument
intended
by
providence
to
bring
to
light
a
great
crime
it
seemed
strange
that
of
all
nights
in
the
year
i
should
have
chosen
that
one
it
seemed
strange
that
after
keeping
the
woman
face
living
in
my
memory
for
so
long
i
should
so
suddenly
meet
it
in
life
there
was
something
more
than
mere
coincidence
in
this
yet
it
seemed
a
horrible
thing
to
do
to
come
under
the
roof
of
my
dearest
friend
and
ruin
his
happiness
forever
then
the
question
came
was
it
not
better
for
him
to
know
the
truth
than
to
live
in
a
fool
paradise
to
take
to
his
heart
a
murderess
to
live
befooled
and
die
deceived
my
heart
rose
in
hot
indignation
against
the
woman
who
had
blighted
his
life
who
would
bring
home
to
him
such
shame
and
anguish
as
must
tear
his
heart
and
drive
him
mad
i
could
not
suppose
for
one
moment
that
i
was
the
only
one
in
the
world
who
knew
her
secret
there
must
be
others
and
meeting
her
suddenly
one
of
these
might
betray
her
secret
might
do
her
greater
harm
and
more
mischief
than
i
could
do
after
hours
of
weary
thought
i
came
to
this
conclusion
that
i
must
find
out
first
of
all
whether
my
suspicions
were
correct
or
not
that
was
evidently
my
first
duty
i
must
know
whether
there
was
any
truth
in
my
suspicions
or
not
i
hated
myself
for
the
task
that
lay
before
me
to
watch
a
woman
to
seek
to
entrap
her
to
play
the
detective
to
seek
to
discover
the
secret
of
one
who
had
so
frankly
and
cordially
offered
me
friendship
yet
it
was
equally
hateful
to
know
that
a
bad
and
wicked
woman
branded
with
sin
stained
with
murder
had
deceived
an
honest
loyal
man
like
lance
fleming
look
which
way
i
would
it
was
a
most
cruel
dilemma
pity
indignation
wonder
fear
reluctance
all
tore
at
my
heart
was
frances
fleming
the
good
pure
woman
she
seemed
to
be
or
was
she
the
woman
branded
with
a
secret
brand
i
must
find
out
for
lance
sake
there
were
times
when
intense
pity
softened
my
heart
almost
moved
me
to
tears
then
the
recollection
of
the
tiny
white
baby
lying
all
night
in
the
sea
swaying
to
and
fro
with
the
waves
steeled
me
i
could
see
again
the
pure
little
waxen
face
as
the
kindly
woman
kissed
it
on
the
pier
i
could
see
the
little
green
grave
with
the
shining
cross
marah
found
drowned
and
here
beside
me
talking
to
me
tending
me
with
gentle
solicitude
was
the
very
woman
i
feared
who
had
drowned
the
child
there
were
times
i
remember
one
particularly
when
she
held
out
a
bunch
of
fine
hothouse
grapes
to
me
that
i
could
have
cried
out
it
is
the
hand
of
a
murderess
take
it
away
but
i
restrained
myself
i
declare
that
during
a
whole
fortnight
i
watched
her
incessantly
i
scrutinized
every
look
every
gesture
i
criticised
every
word
and
in
neither
one
nor
the
other
did
i
find
the
least
shadow
of
blame
she
seemed
to
me
pure
in
heart
thought
and
word
at
times
when
she
read
or
sang
to
us
there
was
a
light
such
as
one
fancies
the
angels
wear
then
i
found
also
what
lance
said
of
her
charity
to
the
poor
was
perfectly
true
they
worshipped
her
no
saint
was
a
greater
saint
to
them
than
the
woman
whom
i
believed
i
had
seen
drown
a
little
child
it
seemed
as
though
she
could
hardly
do
enough
for
them
the
minute
she
heard
that
any
one
was
sick
or
sorry
she
went
to
their
aid
i
have
known
this
beautiful
woman
whose
husband
adored
her
give
up
a
ball
or
a
party
to
sit
with
some
poor
woman
whose
child
was
ill
or
was
ill
herself
and
i
must
speak
too
of
her
devotion
to
see
the
earnest
tender
piety
on
her
beautiful
face
was
marvelous
look
john
lance
would
whisper
to
me
my
wife
looks
like
an
angel
i
was
obliged
to
own
that
she
did
but
what
was
the
soul
like
that
animated
the
beautiful
body
when
we
were
talking
and
we
spent
many
hours
together
in
the
garden
i
was
struck
with
the
beauty
and
nobility
of
her
ideas
she
took
the
right
side
of
everything
her
wisdom
was
full
of
tenderness
she
never
once
gave
utterance
to
a
thought
or
sentence
but
that
i
was
both
pleased
and
struck
with
it
but
for
this
haunting
suspicion
i
should
have
pronounced
her
a
perfect
woman
for
i
could
see
no
fault
in
her
i
had
been
a
fortnight
at
dutton
manor
and
but
for
this
it
would
have
been
a
very
happy
fortnight
lance
and
i
had
fallen
into
old
loving
terms
of
intimacy
and
frances
made
a
most
lovable
and
harmonious
third
a
whole
fortnight
i
had
studied
her
criticised
her
and
was
more
bewildered
than
ever
more
sure
of
two
things
the
first
was
that
it
was
next
to
impossible
that
she
had
ever
been
anything
different
to
what
she
was
now
the
second
that
she
must
be
the
woman
i
had
seen
on
the
pier
what
under
those
circumstances
was
any
man
to
do
no
single
incident
had
happened
to
interrupt
the
tranquil
course
of
life
but
from
day
to
day
i
grew
more
wretched
with
the
weight
of
my
miserable
secret
one
afternoon
i
remember
that
the
lilacs
were
all
in
bloom
and
lance
sat
with
his
beautiful
wife
where
a
great
group
of
trees
stood
when
i
reached
them
they
were
speaking
of
the
sea
i
always
long
for
the
sea
in
summertime
said
lance
when
the
sun
is
hot
and
the
air
full
of
dust
and
no
trees
give
shade
and
the
grass
seems
burned
i
long
for
the
sea
love
of
water
seems
almost
mania
with
me
from
the
deep
blue
ocean
with
its
foaming
billows
to
the
smallest
pool
hidden
in
a
wood
it
is
strange
frances
with
your
soul
that
you
dislike
the
sea
she
had
gathered
a
spray
of
the
beautiful
lilac
and
held
it
to
her
lips
was
it
the
shade
of
the
flower
or
did
the
color
leave
her
face
if
so
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
it
change
do
you
really
dislike
the
sea
mrs
fleming
i
asked
yes
she
replied
laconically
why
i
asked
again
i
can
not
tell
she
answered
it
must
be
on
the
old
principle
do
not
like
thee
doctor
fell
the
reason
why
i
can
not
tell
but
only
this
i
know
full
well
i
do
not
like
thee
doctor
fell
those
lines
hardly
apply
to
the
sea
i
said
i
thought
love
for
the
sea
was
inborn
with
every
man
and
woman
in
england
it
is
not
with
me
she
said
she
spoke
quite
gently
there
was
not
the
least
hurry
or
confusion
but
i
was
quite
sure
the
color
had
faded
from
her
face
was
it
possible
that
i
had
found
a
hole
the
strong
armor
at
last
lance
turned
a
laughing
face
to
me
my
wife
is
as
strong
in
her
dislikes
as
in
her
likes
he
said
she
never
will
go
to
the
sea
last
year
i
spent
a
whole
month
in
trying
to
persuade
her
this
year
i
have
begun
in
good
time
and
i
intend
to
give
it
three
months
good
trial
but
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
quite
in
vain
why
do
you
dislike
the
sea
i
repeated
you
must
have
a
reason
i
think
she
replied
it
makes
me
melancholy
and
low
spirited
well
it
might
i
thought
for
the
rush
and
fall
of
the
waves
must
be
like
a
vast
requiem
to
her
that
is
not
the
effect
the
sea
has
upon
most
people
i
said
no
i
suppose
not
it
has
upon
me
she
answered
then
smiling
at
me
as
she
went
on
you
seem
to
think
it
is
my
fault
ford
that
i
do
not
love
the
sea
it
is
your
misfortune
i
replied
and
our
eyes
met
i
meant
nothing
by
the
words
but
a
shifting
curious
look
came
into
her
face
and
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
been
there
her
eyes
fell
before
mine
i
suppose
it
is
she
said
quietly
but
from
the
moment
we
were
never
quite
the
same
again
she
watched
me
curiously
and
i
knew
it
like
or
dislike
frances
give
way
this
time
said
lance
and
john
will
go
with
us
do
you
really
wish
it
she
asked
i
should
like
it
i
think
it
would
do
us
all
good
and
after
all
yours
is
but
a
fancy
frances
if
we
go
at
all
she
said
let
us
go
to
the
great
northern
sea
not
to
the
south
where
it
is
smiling
and
treacherous
those
southern
seas
hide
much
i
said
and
again
she
looked
at
me
with
a
curious
intent
gaze
a
gaze
as
though
she
were
trying
to
make
something
out
what
do
they
hide
john
asked
lance
indifferently
sharp
rocks
and
shifting
sands
i
answered
so
do
the
northern
seas
he
replied
a
soft
sweet
voice
said
every
one
has
his
own
taste
i
love
the
country
you
love
the
sea
i
find
more
beauty
in
this
bunch
of
lilac
than
i
should
in
all
the
seaweed
that
was
ever
thrown
on
the
beach
to
me
there
is
more
poetry
and
more
loveliness
in
the
ripple
of
the
leaves
the
changeful
hues
of
the
trees
and
flowers
the
corn
in
the
fields
the
fruit
in
the
orchards
than
in
the
perpetual
monotony
of
the
sea
that
is
not
fair
frances
cried
lance
say
what
you
will
but
never
call
the
sea
monotonous
it
is
never
that
it
always
gives
on
the
impression
of
power
and
majesty
and
of
mystery
i
interrupted
of
mystery
she
repeated
and
the
words
seemed
forced
from
her
in
spite
of
herself
yes
of
mystery
i
said
think
what
is
buried
in
the
sea
think
of
the
vessels
that
have
sank
laden
with
human
beings
no
one
will
know
of
the
mysteries
of
the
sea
until
the
day
when
she
gives
up
the
dead
the
spray
of
lilac
fell
to
the
ground
she
rose
quickly
and
made
no
attempt
to
regain
it
it
is
growing
chilly
she
said
i
will
go
into
the
house
a
strange
thing
that
my
wife
does
not
like
the
sea
said
lance
but
it
was
not
strange
to
my
mind
not
strange
at
all
chapter
viii
my
suspicion
from
that
time
i
felt
was
a
truth
i
knew
that
there
were
characters
so
complex
that
no
human
being
could
understand
them
here
was
a
beautiful
surface
heaven
only
knew
what
lay
underneath
there
was
no
outward
brand
of
murder
on
the
white
brow
or
red
stain
on
the
soft
white
hand
but
day
by
day
the
certainty
grew
in
my
mind
another
thing
struck
me
very
much
we
were
sitting
one
day
quite
alone
on
the
grass
near
a
pretty
little
pool
of
water
called
dutton
pool
in
some
parts
it
was
very
shallow
in
some
very
deep
lance
had
gone
somewhere
on
business
and
had
left
us
to
entertain
each
other
i
had
often
noticed
that
one
of
fleming
favorite
ornaments
was
a
golden
locket
with
one
fine
diamond
in
the
center
she
wore
it
suspended
by
a
small
chain
from
her
neck
as
she
sat
talking
to
me
she
was
playing
with
the
chain
when
it
suddenly
became
unfastened
and
the
locket
fell
from
it
in
less
than
a
second
it
was
hidden
in
the
long
grass
she
looked
for
it
in
silence
for
some
minutes
then
she
said
gently
i
have
dropped
my
locket
ford
is
it
near
you
i
can
not
find
it
is
it
one
you
prize
very
much
i
asked
i
should
not
like
to
lose
it
she
replied
and
her
face
paled
as
searching
in
the
long
grass
she
saw
nothing
of
it
i
found
it
in
a
few
minutes
but
it
was
lying
open
the
fall
had
loosened
the
spring
i
could
not
help
seeing
the
contents
as
i
gave
it
to
her
a
round
ring
of
pale
golden
hair
a
baby
curl
i
said
as
i
returned
it
to
her
her
whole
face
went
in
one
minute
the
only
thing
i
have
belonging
to
my
little
sister
she
said
she
died
when
i
was
a
child
you
must
prize
it
i
said
but
i
could
not
keep
the
dryness
of
suspicion
from
my
voice
fleming
i
asked
suddenly
are
you
like
lance
and
myself
without
relations
almost
she
replied
briefly
strange
that
three
people
should
be
almost
alone
in
the
world
but
for
each
other
i
said
i
was
left
an
orphan
when
i
was
four
years
old
she
said
only
heaven
knows
how
i
have
cried
out
upon
my
parents
for
leaving
me
i
never
had
one
happy
hour
can
you
imagine
a
whole
childhood
passed
without
one
happy
hour
hardly
i
said
with
white
nervous
fingers
she
fastened
the
gold
chain
round
her
neck
again
not
one
happy
hour
she
said
i
was
left
under
the
care
of
my
grandmother
a
proud
cold
cruel
woman
who
never
said
a
kind
word
to
me
and
who
grudged
me
every
slice
of
bread
and
butter
i
ate
she
looked
at
me
still
holding
the
golden
locket
in
her
white
fingers
if
i
had
been
like
other
girls
she
said
if
i
had
parents
to
love
me
brothers
and
sisters
friends
or
relatives
i
should
have
been
different
believe
me
ford
there
are
white
slaves
in
england
whose
slavery
is
worse
than
that
of
an
african
child
i
was
one
of
them
i
think
of
my
youth
with
a
sick
shudder
i
think
of
my
childhood
with
horror
and
i
almost
thank
heaven
that
the
tyrant
is
dead
who
blighted
my
life
now
the
real
woman
was
breaking
through
the
mask
her
face
flushed
her
eyes
shone
i
often
talk
to
lance
about
it
she
said
this
terrible
childhood
of
mine
i
was
punished
for
the
least
offence
i
never
heard
a
word
of
pity
or
affection
i
never
saw
a
look
of
anything
but
hate
on
my
grandmother
face
no
one
was
ever
pitiful
to
me
fierce
words
fierce
blows
complaints
of
the
burden
i
was
that
was
all
my
mother
mother
ever
gave
to
me
i
need
not
say
that
i
hated
her
and
learned
to
loathe
the
life
i
fain
would
have
laid
down
do
i
tire
you
mr
ford
on
the
contrary
i
am
deeply
interested
i
replied
she
went
on
my
grandmother
was
not
poor
she
was
greedy
she
had
a
good
income
which
died
with
her
and
she
strongly
objected
to
spend
it
on
me
she
paid
for
my
education
on
the
condition
that
when
i
could
get
my
own
living
by
teaching
i
should
repay
her
thank
heaven
i
did
so
then
you
were
a
governess
i
said
yes
i
began
to
get
my
own
living
at
fifteen
i
was
tall
for
my
age
and
quite
capable
she
said
but
fifteen
is
very
young
ford
for
a
girl
to
be
thrown
on
to
the
world
you
must
have
been
a
very
beautiful
girl
i
said
yes
so
much
the
worse
for
me
she
seemed
to
repent
of
the
words
as
soon
as
they
were
uttered
i
mean
she
added
quickly
that
my
grandmother
hated
me
the
more
for
it
there
was
silence
between
us
for
some
minutes
then
she
added
you
may
imagine
after
such
an
unloved
life
how
i
love
lance
he
is
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
i
said
and
the
woman
who
could
deceive
him
ought
to
be
shot
what
woman
would
deceive
him
she
asked
indeed
for
matter
of
that
what
woman
could
i
am
his
wife
it
happens
very
often
i
said
trying
to
speak
carelessly
that
good
and
loyal
men
like
lance
are
the
most
easily
deceived
it
should
not
be
so
she
said
she
was
startled
again
i
saw
it
in
her
face
that
same
afternoon
we
drove
into
vale
royal
fleming
had
several
poor
people
whom
she
wished
to
see
and
some
shopping
to
do
you
should
take
your
locket
to
a
jeweler
i
said
and
have
the
spring
secured
what
locket
is
that
asked
lance
looking
up
eagerly
from
his
paper
mine
she
replied
this
she
held
it
out
for
his
inspection
i
nearly
lost
it
this
morning
she
said
it
fell
from
my
neck
is
it
the
one
that
holds
your
sister
hair
he
asked
yes
she
replied
opening
it
and
holding
it
out
for
him
to
see
what
nerve
she
had
if
this
was
what
i
imagined
the
hair
of
the
little
dead
child
loving
lance
rose
from
his
chair
and
kissed
her
you
would
not
like
to
lose
that
my
darling
would
you
he
said
excepting
me
that
is
all
you
have
in
the
world
they
seemed
to
forget
all
about
me
she
clung
to
him
and
he
kissed
her
face
until
i
thought
he
would
never
give
over
how
lovely
you
were
when
i
found
you
frances
he
said
do
you
remember
the
evening
you
were
bending
over
the
crysanthemums
i
shall
forget
my
own
life
and
my
own
soul
before
i
forget
that
she
replied
and
i
said
to
myself
even
if
my
suspicion
be
perfectly
true
have
i
any
right
to
mar
such
love
as
that
i
noticed
that
during
all
the
conversation
about
the
locket
she
never
once
looked
at
me
we
went
to
vale
royal
and
there
never
was
man
so
bewildered
as
lance
proposed
that
we
should
go
visiting
with
fleming
get
your
purse
ready
john
he
said
this
visit
will
require
a
small
fortune
i
find
the
poor
value
kind
words
as
much
as
money
said
the
beautiful
woman
then
they
must
be
very
disinterested
he
said
laughingly
i
should
prefer
money
you
are
only
jesting
she
said
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
her
go
into
those
poor
little
dirty
houses
there
was
no
pride
no
patronage
no
condescension
she
was
simply
sweetly
natural
she
listened
to
their
complaints
gave
them
comfort
and
relieved
their
wants
as
i
watched
her
i
could
not
help
thinking
to
myself
that
if
i
were
a
fashionable
or
titled
lady
this
would
be
my
favorite
relaxation
visiting
and
relieving
the
poor
i
never
saw
so
much
happiness
purchased
by
a
few
pounds
we
came
to
a
little
cottage
that
stood
by
itself
in
a
garden
are
you
growing
tired
she
asked
of
her
husband
i
never
tire
with
you
he
replied
and
you
mr
ford
she
said
she
never
overlooked
or
forgot
me
but
studied
my
comfort
on
every
occasion
i
could
have
told
her
that
i
was
watching
what
was
to
me
a
perfect
problem
the
kindly
gentle
pitying
deeds
of
a
woman
who
had
i
believed
murdered
her
own
child
i
am
not
tired
fleming
i
am
interested
i
said
the
little
cottage
which
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
wild
patch
of
garden
was
inhabited
by
a
he
was
away
at
work
his
wife
sat
at
home
nursing
a
little
babe
a
small
fair
tiny
child
evidently
not
more
than
three
weeks
old
dying
too
if
one
could
judge
from
the
face
she
bent
over
it
the
beautiful
graceful
woman
who
was
lance
wife
ah
heaven
the
change
that
came
over
her
the
passion
of
mother
love
that
came
into
her
face
she
was
transformed
let
me
hold
the
little
one
for
you
she
said
while
you
rest
for
a
few
minutes
and
the
poor
young
mother
gratefully
accepted
the
offer
what
a
picture
she
made
in
the
gloomy
room
of
the
little
cottage
her
beautiful
face
and
shining
hair
her
dress
sweeping
the
ground
and
the
tiny
child
lying
in
her
arms
does
it
suffer
much
she
asked
in
her
sweet
compassionate
voice
it
did
replied
the
mother
but
i
have
given
it
something
to
keep
it
quiet
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
drugged
it
asked
fleming
only
a
little
cordial
nothing
more
it
keeps
it
sleeping
and
when
it
sleeps
it
does
not
suffer
she
shook
her
beautiful
head
it
is
a
bad
practice
she
said
more
babes
are
killed
by
drugs
than
die
a
natural
death
i
was
determined
she
should
look
at
me
i
stepped
forward
and
touched
the
child
face
do
you
not
think
it
is
merciful
at
times
to
give
a
child
like
this
drugs
when
it
has
to
die
to
lessen
the
pain
of
death
to
keep
it
from
crying
out
ah
me
that
startled
fear
that
leaped
into
her
eyes
the
sudden
quiver
on
the
beautiful
face
i
do
not
know
she
said
i
do
not
understand
such
things
what
can
it
matter
i
said
whether
a
little
child
like
this
dies
conscious
or
not
it
can
not
pray
it
must
go
straight
to
heaven
do
you
not
think
anyone
who
loved
it
and
had
to
see
it
die
would
think
it
greatest
kindness
to
drug
it
my
eyes
held
hers
i
would
not
lose
their
glance
she
could
not
take
them
away
i
saw
the
fear
leap
into
them
then
die
away
she
was
saying
to
herself
what
could
i
know
but
i
knew
i
remembered
what
the
doctor
said
in
brighton
when
the
inquest
was
held
on
the
tiny
white
body
that
it
had
been
mercifully
drugged
before
it
was
drowned
i
can
not
tell
she
replied
with
a
gentle
shake
of
the
head
i
only
know
that
unfortunately
the
poor
people
use
these
kind
of
cordials
too
readily
i
should
not
like
to
decide
whether
in
a
case
like
this
it
is
true
kindness
or
not
what
a
pretty
child
ford
what
a
pity
that
it
must
die
could
it
be
that
she
who
bent
with
such
loving
care
over
this
little
stranger
who
touched
its
tiny
face
with
her
delicate
lips
who
held
it
cradled
in
her
soft
arms
was
the
same
desperate
woman
who
had
thrown
her
child
into
the
sea
chapter
ix
fleming
was
not
at
her
ease
with
me
i
found
her
several
times
watching
me
with
a
curious
intent
gaze
seeking
as
it
were
to
pierce
my
thoughts
to
dive
into
my
motives
but
always
puzzled
even
as
i
was
puzzled
over
her
that
round
of
visiting
made
me
more
loath
than
ever
to
believe
that
i
was
right
such
gentle
thought
and
care
such
consideration
such
real
charity
i
had
never
seen
before
i
was
not
surprised
when
lance
told
me
that
she
was
considered
quite
an
angel
by
the
poor
i
fell
ill
with
anxiety
i
never
knew
what
to
say
or
think
i
did
what
many
others
in
dire
perplexity
do
i
went
to
one
older
wiser
and
better
than
myself
a
old
minister
whom
i
had
known
for
many
years
and
in
whom
i
had
implicit
trust
i
mentioned
no
names
but
i
told
him
the
story
he
was
a
compassionate
man
but
he
decided
that
the
husband
should
be
told
such
a
woman
he
said
must
have
unnatural
qualities
could
not
possibly
be
one
fitted
for
any
man
to
trust
she
might
be
insane
she
might
be
subject
to
mania
a
thousand
things
might
occur
which
made
it
he
thought
quite
imperative
that
such
a
secret
should
not
be
withheld
from
her
husband
others
had
had
a
share
in
it
and
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
it
would
eventually
become
known
better
hear
it
from
the
lips
of
a
friend
than
from
the
lips
of
a
foe
perhaps
he
advised
it
might
be
as
well
for
you
to
speak
to
her
first
it
would
give
her
a
fair
chance
if
it
were
not
true
she
could
deny
it
although
if
she
proved
to
be
innocent
and
i
had
made
a
mistake
i
deserved
what
i
should
no
doubt
get
if
she
were
guilty
and
owned
it
she
would
have
some
warning
at
least
that
seemed
to
me
the
best
plan
if
i
could
speak
to
her
break
it
to
her
in
some
way
or
other
a
few
more
days
passed
if
any
doubt
was
left
in
my
mind
what
happened
one
morning
at
breakfast
would
have
satisfied
me
lance
had
taken
up
the
paper
i
was
reading
some
letters
and
fleming
making
tea
lance
looked
suddenly
from
his
paper
i
used
to
think
drink
was
the
greatest
curse
in
england
he
said
have
you
changed
your
opinion
i
asked
i
have
i
think
now
the
crying
sin
of
the
country
is
as
he
uttered
the
words
his
wife
was
just
in
the
act
of
pouring
some
cream
into
my
cup
it
did
not
surprise
me
that
the
pretty
silver
jug
and
the
cream
all
fell
together
lance
laughed
aloud
why
frances
he
cried
i
have
never
seen
you
do
such
a
clumsy
thing
before
she
was
deadly
pale
her
hand
shaking
i
have
frightened
myself
she
said
and
no
wonder
with
such
a
noise
a
servant
came
who
made
everything
right
then
lance
continued
you
interrupted
me
frances
i
was
just
saying
that
is
one
of
the
greatest
blots
on
the
civilization
of
the
present
day
it
is
such
a
horrible
thing
to
speak
of
she
said
feebly
it
wants
some
speaking
about
said
lance
i
never
take
up
a
paper
without
reading
one
or
two
cases
i
wonder
that
the
government
does
not
take
it
up
and
issue
some
decree
or
other
it
is
a
blot
on
the
face
of
the
land
i
do
not
suppose
that
any
decree
of
government
would
change
it
i
said
the
evil
lies
too
deeply
for
that
the
law
should
be
made
equal
as
it
is
the
whole
blame
shame
and
punishment
fall
on
the
woman
while
the
man
goes
free
there
will
be
no
change
for
the
better
while
that
is
the
case
i
have
not
patience
to
think
of
the
irregularity
of
the
law
you
are
right
john
said
my
old
friend
still
cruelty
in
a
woman
is
so
horrible
and
the
woman
must
be
as
cruel
as
a
demon
who
deserts
or
slays
her
own
child
if
i
had
my
own
way
i
would
hang
every
one
who
does
it
there
would
soon
be
an
end
of
it
then
there
was
a
low
startled
cry
and
the
paper
fell
to
the
ground
fleming
rose
from
her
chair
with
a
ghastly
face
frances
cried
her
husband
what
is
the
matter
you
will
talk
of
such
horrible
things
she
replied
vehemently
and
you
know
that
i
can
not
bear
them
sweetheart
he
whispered
as
he
kissed
her
i
will
be
more
careful
i
know
a
sensitive
heart
like
yours
can
not
bear
the
knowledge
of
such
things
you
must
forgive
me
frances
but
to
me
there
is
something
far
more
loathing
in
the
woman
who
kills
a
child
than
in
the
woman
who
slays
a
man
do
not
look
so
pale
and
grieved
my
darling
john
we
must
be
more
careful
what
we
say
i
must
beg
you
to
remember
that
you
began
the
subject
lance
i
am
ashamed
of
making
such
a
fuss
she
continued
but
there
are
some
subjects
too
horrible
even
to
dwell
upon
or
speak
of
and
that
is
one
i
am
going
into
the
garden
lance
perhaps
you
and
ford
would
like
your
cigars
there
i
am
going
to
prune
a
favorite
rose
tree
that
is
growing
wild
do
you
understand
pruning
mrs
fleming
i
asked
such
small
things
as
rose
trees
she
said
we
will
follow
you
frances
said
her
husband
my
case
is
empty
i
must
get
some
more
cigars
i
fancied
that
she
was
unwilling
to
leave
us
together
she
lingered
a
few
minutes
then
went
out
then
simple
honest
lance
turned
to
me
with
his
face
full
of
animation
john
did
you
ever
see
such
a
woman
in
all
your
life
she
is
almost
too
sensitive
my
suspicions
were
certainties
now
and
my
mind
was
more
than
ever
tossed
and
whirled
in
tortured
doubt
and
dread
i
shall
never
forget
one
evening
that
came
soon
afterwards
we
went
to
dine
with
a
friend
of
lance
a
squire
peyton
who
lived
not
far
away
and
he
was
the
possessor
of
some
very
fine
pictures
of
which
he
was
very
proud
he
took
us
through
his
pretty
arranged
gallery
this
is
my
last
purchase
he
said
we
all
three
stopped
to
look
at
a
large
square
picture
representing
the
mother
of
the
little
moses
placing
his
cradle
of
rushes
amongst
the
tall
reeds
in
the
water
i
saw
fleming
look
at
it
with
eyes
that
were
wet
with
tears
does
it
sadden
you
asked
lance
it
need
not
the
little
one
looks
young
and
tender
to
be
left
alone
but
the
water
is
silent
and
the
mother
is
near
she
never
left
him
what
a
pretty
story
of
it
is
the
beautiful
face
paled
the
lips
trembled
slightly
it
is
a
beautiful
picture
she
said
to
come
from
that
land
of
darkness
it
makes
something
of
the
poetry
of
the
nile
watching
her
i
said
to
myself
that
woman
has
not
deadened
her
conscience
she
has
tried
and
failed
there
is
more
good
than
evil
in
her
all
night
long
there
sounded
in
my
ears
those
words
a
life
for
a
life
and
i
wondered
what
would
what
could
be
the
punishment
of
a
mother
who
took
the
life
of
her
own
child
chapter
x
this
state
of
things
could
not
last
a
shade
of
fear
or
mistrust
came
in
her
manner
to
me
i
must
repeat
even
at
the
risk
of
being
wearisome
that
i
think
no
man
was
ever
in
such
a
painful
position
had
it
not
been
for
my
i
should
have
loved
fleming
for
her
beauty
her
goodness
and
her
devotion
to
my
dear
old
friend
i
could
not
bear
to
tell
him
the
truth
nor
could
i
bear
that
he
should
be
so
basely
and
terribly
deceived
that
he
should
be
living
with
and
loving
one
whom
i
knew
to
be
a
murderess
so
i
waited
for
an
opportunity
of
appealing
to
herself
and
it
came
sooner
than
i
had
expected
one
afternoon
lance
had
to
leave
us
on
business
he
said
he
might
be
absent
some
few
hours
he
was
going
to
vale
royal
he
asked
me
if
i
would
take
fleming
out
she
had
complained
of
headache
and
he
thought
a
walk
down
by
the
river
might
be
good
for
her
i
promised
to
do
so
and
then
i
knew
the
time
for
speaking
to
her
had
come
i
can
not
tell
how
it
was
that
our
walk
was
delayed
until
the
gloaming
and
then
we
went
at
once
to
the
river
for
no
other
reason
that
i
can
see
except
that
lance
had
wished
us
to
go
there
but
to
my
dying
day
i
can
never
forget
the
scene
the
sky
was
roseate
with
crimson
clouds
and
golden
with
gold
the
river
ran
swiftly
brimming
full
to
the
banks
the
glow
of
the
sunlight
lay
on
the
hills
around
on
the
green
fields
on
the
distant
woods
on
the
bank
where
we
stood
on
the
tall
noble
trees
on
the
wild
flowers
and
blossoms
better
almost
than
anything
else
i
remember
a
great
patch
of
scarlet
poppies
that
grew
in
the
long
green
grass
even
now
although
this
took
place
a
long
time
ago
the
sight
of
crimson
poppy
makes
my
heart
ache
the
withered
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
lay
across
the
river
bank
one
end
of
it
was
washed
by
the
stream
fleming
sat
down
upon
it
and
the
scarlet
poppies
were
at
her
feet
we
can
see
nothing
so
pretty
as
the
sunset
over
the
river
ford
she
said
let
us
watch
it
we
sat
for
some
few
minutes
in
silence
the
rosy
glow
from
the
sky
and
the
river
seemed
to
fall
on
her
face
as
she
turned
it
to
the
water
the
time
had
come
i
knew
that
yet
only
heaven
knows
how
i
shrank
from
the
task
i
would
rather
have
died
yet
my
sense
of
justice
urged
me
on
was
it
fair
that
lance
fleming
should
lavish
the
whole
love
of
his
life
on
a
murderess
what
are
you
thinking
so
intently
about
mr
ford
she
asked
me
shall
i
tell
you
i
asked
yes
by
all
means
she
replied
i
am
sure
the
subject
is
very
grave
you
look
so
unhappy
now
the
time
was
come
that
beautiful
face
would
never
look
into
mine
again
i
steeled
my
heart
by
thinking
of
the
tiny
baby
face
i
had
seen
on
the
wooden
bench
of
the
pier
so
like
hers
the
little
drowned
face
i
will
tell
you
of
what
i
am
thinking
fleming
i
said
but
i
must
tell
it
to
you
as
a
story
do
she
said
in
a
gentle
voice
and
she
gathered
the
scarlet
poppies
as
she
spoke
there
were
two
friends
once
upon
a
time
i
began
who
loved
each
other
with
a
love
deeper
and
truer
than
the
love
of
brothers
she
nodded
her
head
with
a
charming
smile
i
saw
an
expression
of
great
relief
pass
over
her
face
i
understand
she
said
as
you
and
lance
love
each
other
there
is
something
most
beautiful
in
the
love
of
men
these
two
spent
much
time
together
their
interests
were
identical
they
shared
at
that
time
the
same
hopes
and
fears
they
were
parted
for
a
time
one
was
busy
with
his
own
affairs
the
other
an
invalid
went
to
brighton
for
his
health
how
the
smile
died
away
the
sun
did
not
set
more
surely
or
more
slowly
than
that
sweet
smile
of
interest
died
from
her
lips
but
no
fear
replaced
it
at
first
the
friend
who
was
an
invalid
went
to
brighton
as
i
have
said
for
his
health
and
either
fate
or
providence
took
him
one
night
to
the
chain
pier
i
did
not
look
at
her
i
dared
not
my
eyes
wandered
over
the
running
river
where
the
crimson
clouds
were
reflected
like
blood
but
i
heard
a
gasping
sound
as
of
breath
hardly
drawn
i
went
on
the
chain
pier
that
evening
lay
in
the
midst
of
soft
thick
gloom
there
was
no
sound
on
it
save
the
low
washing
of
the
waves
and
the
shrill
voice
of
the
wind
as
it
played
amongst
the
wooden
piles
he
sat
silent
absorbed
in
thought
when
suddenly
a
woman
came
down
the
pier
a
tall
beautiful
woman
who
walked
to
the
end
and
stood
leaning
there
i
saw
the
scarlet
poppies
fall
from
the
nerveless
hands
on
the
green
grass
but
the
figure
by
my
side
seemed
to
have
suddenly
turned
to
stone
i
dare
not
look
at
her
the
scene
was
far
greater
agony
to
me
i
almost
believe
than
to
her
i
went
on
the
woman
stood
there
for
some
short
time
in
silence
then
she
became
restless
and
looked
all
around
to
see
if
anyone
were
near
then
she
walked
to
the
side
of
the
pier
she
did
not
see
the
dark
form
in
the
corner
she
raised
something
in
her
arms
and
dropped
it
into
the
sea
there
was
a
sound
but
it
was
like
nothing
human
it
was
neither
sigh
nor
moan
but
more
pitiful
than
either
the
poppies
lay
still
on
the
grass
and
a
great
hush
seemed
to
have
fallen
over
the
river
into
the
sea
i
repeated
and
the
man
as
it
fell
saw
a
shawl
of
black
and
gray
she
tried
to
spring
up
and
i
knew
that
her
impulse
was
to
rush
to
the
river
i
held
her
arms
and
she
remained
motionless
the
very
air
around
us
seemed
to
beat
with
passionate
pulse
of
pain
there
was
a
faint
splash
in
the
water
i
went
on
it
was
all
over
in
less
than
a
second
and
then
the
swift
waves
rolled
on
as
before
the
woman
stood
motionless
when
she
turned
to
leave
the
spot
the
moon
shone
full
on
her
face
ghastly
desperate
and
beautiful
he
saw
it
as
plainly
as
i
see
the
river
here
he
heard
her
as
plainly
as
i
hear
the
river
here
she
cried
aloud
as
she
went
away
my
god
if
i
dare
if
i
dare
can
you
tell
what
happened
listen
how
wonderful
are
the
ways
of
god
who
hates
murder
and
punishes
it
she
flung
the
burden
into
the
sea
feeling
sure
it
would
sink
but
it
caught
the
black
and
gray
shawl
caught
on
some
hooks
that
had
been
driven
into
the
outer
woodwork
of
the
pier
it
caught
and
hung
there
the
shawl
moving
to
and
fro
with
every
breath
of
wind
and
every
wave
without
a
word
or
a
cry
she
fell
with
her
face
in
the
grass
oh
heaven
be
pitiful
to
all
who
are
stricken
and
guilty
i
went
on
quickly
a
boatman
found
it
and
the
bundle
contained
a
little
drowned
child
a
fair
waxen
babe
beautiful
even
though
it
had
lain
in
the
salt
bitter
waters
of
the
green
sea
all
night
now
comes
the
horror
fleming
when
the
man
who
saw
the
scene
went
after
some
years
to
visit
the
friend
whom
he
loved
so
dearly
he
recognized
in
that
friend
wife
the
woman
who
threw
the
child
into
the
sea
again
came
the
sound
that
was
like
nothing
human
what
was
that
man
to
do
i
asked
he
could
not
be
silent
the
friend
who
loved
and
trusted
him
must
have
been
most
basely
deceived
he
could
not
hide
a
murder
yet
the
woman
was
so
lovely
so
lovable
she
was
seemingly
so
good
so
charitable
so
devoted
to
her
husband
that
he
was
puzzled
tortured
at
last
he
resolved
upon
telling
her
i
have
told
you
then
silence
deep
and
awful
fell
over
us
it
lasted
until
i
saw
that
i
must
break
it
she
lay
motionless
on
the
ground
her
face
buried
in
the
grass
what
should
you
have
done
in
that
man
place
mrs
fleming
i
asked
then
she
raised
her
face
it
was
whiter
more
despairing
more
ghastly
than
i
had
seen
it
on
the
pier
i
knew
it
must
come
she
wailed
oh
heaven
how
often
have
i
dreaded
this
i
knew
from
the
first
then
it
was
you
i
said
it
was
me
she
replied
i
need
not
try
to
hide
it
any
longer
why
should
i
every
leaf
on
every
tree
every
raindrop
that
has
fallen
every
wind
that
has
whispered
has
told
it
aloud
ever
since
if
i
hide
it
from
you
someone
else
will
start
up
and
tell
if
i
deny
it
then
the
very
stones
in
the
street
will
cry
it
out
yes
it
was
me
wretched
miserable
me
the
most
miserable
the
most
guilty
woman
alive
it
was
me
my
heart
went
out
to
her
in
fullness
of
pity
poor
unhappy
woman
sobbing
her
heart
out
weeping
as
surely
no
one
ever
wept
before
i
wished
that
heaven
had
made
anyone
else
her
judge
than
me
then
she
sat
up
facing
me
and
i
wondered
what
the
judge
must
think
when
the
sentence
of
death
passes
his
lips
i
knew
that
this
was
the
sentence
of
death
for
this
woman
you
never
knew
what
passed
after
did
you
i
asked
no
not
at
all
was
the
half
sullen
reply
not
at
all
did
you
never
purchase
a
brighton
paper
or
look
into
a
london
paper
to
see
no
she
replied
then
i
will
tell
you
i
said
and
i
told
her
all
that
had
passed
how
the
people
had
stood
round
the
little
baby
and
the
men
cursed
the
cruel
hands
that
had
drowned
the
little
babe
did
they
curse
my
hands
she
asked
and
i
saw
her
looking
at
them
in
wonder
yes
the
men
said
hard
words
but
the
women
were
pitiful
and
kind
one
kissed
the
little
face
dried
it
and
kissed
it
with
tears
in
her
eyes
was
it
your
own
child
there
was
a
long
pause
a
long
silence
a
terrible
few
minutes
and
then
she
answered
yes
it
was
my
child
her
voice
was
full
of
despair
she
folded
her
hands
and
laid
them
on
her
lap
i
knew
it
must
come
she
said
now
let
me
try
to
think
what
i
must
do
i
meet
now
that
which
i
have
dreaded
so
long
oh
lance
my
love
lance
my
love
lance
you
will
not
tell
him
she
cried
turning
to
me
with
impassioned
appeal
you
will
not
you
could
not
break
his
heart
and
mine
you
could
not
kill
me
oh
for
heaven
sake
say
you
will
not
tell
him
then
i
found
her
on
her
knees
at
my
feet
sobbing
passionate
cries
i
must
not
tell
him
it
would
kill
him
she
must
go
away
if
i
said
she
must
she
would
go
from
the
heart
and
the
home
where
she
had
nestled
in
safety
so
long
she
would
die
she
would
do
anything
if
only
i
would
not
tell
him
he
had
loved
and
trusted
her
so
she
loved
him
so
dearly
i
must
not
tell
if
i
liked
she
would
go
to
the
river
and
throw
herself
in
she
would
give
her
life
freely
gladly
if
only
i
would
not
tell
him
so
i
sat
holding
as
it
were
the
passionate
aching
heart
in
my
hand
you
must
calm
yourself
i
said
let
us
talk
reasonably
we
can
not
talk
while
you
are
like
this
she
beat
her
white
hands
together
and
i
could
not
still
her
cries
they
were
all
for
lance
her
love
lance
chapter
xi
you
must
listen
to
me
i
said
i
want
you
to
see
how
truly
this
is
the
work
of
providence
and
not
of
mere
chance
i
told
her
how
i
often
had
been
attracted
to
the
pier
i
told
her
all
that
was
said
by
the
crowd
around
of
the
man
who
carried
the
little
dead
child
to
the
of
the
tiny
little
body
that
lay
in
its
white
dress
in
the
bare
large
desolate
room
and
of
the
flowers
that
the
kindly
matron
had
covered
it
with
i
told
her
how
i
had
taken
compassion
on
the
forlorn
little
creature
had
purchased
its
grave
and
of
the
white
stone
with
marah
upon
it
marah
found
drowned
and
then
poor
soul
poor
hapless
soul
she
clung
to
my
hands
and
covered
them
with
kisses
and
tears
did
you
did
you
do
that
she
moaned
how
good
you
are
but
you
will
not
tell
him
i
was
mad
when
i
did
that
mad
as
women
often
are
with
sorrow
shame
and
despair
i
will
suffer
anything
if
you
will
only
promise
not
to
tell
lance
do
you
think
it
is
fair
i
asked
that
he
should
be
so
cruelly
deceived
that
he
should
lavish
the
whole
love
of
his
heart
upon
a
murderess
i
shall
not
forget
her
she
sprang
from
the
ground
where
she
had
been
kneeling
and
stood
erect
before
me
no
thank
heaven
i
am
not
that
she
said
i
am
everything
else
that
is
base
and
vile
but
not
that
you
were
that
indeed
i
replied
the
child
you
flung
into
the
sea
was
living
not
dead
it
was
not
living
she
cried
it
was
dead
an
hour
before
i
reached
there
the
doctors
said
for
there
was
an
inquest
on
the
tiny
body
they
said
the
child
had
been
drugged
before
it
was
drowned
but
that
it
had
died
from
drowning
oh
no
a
thousand
times
she
cried
oh
believe
me
i
did
not
wilfully
murder
my
own
child
i
did
not
indeed
let
me
tell
you
you
are
a
just
and
merciful
man
john
ford
let
me
tell
you
you
must
hear
my
story
you
shall
give
me
my
sentence
i
will
leave
it
in
your
hands
i
will
tell
you
all
you
had
better
tell
lance
not
me
i
cried
what
can
i
do
no
you
listen
you
judge
it
may
be
that
when
you
have
heard
all
you
will
take
pity
on
me
you
may
spare
me
you
may
say
to
yourself
that
i
have
been
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
you
may
think
that
i
have
suffered
enough
and
that
i
may
live
out
the
rest
of
my
life
with
lance
let
me
tell
you
and
you
shall
judge
me
she
fell
over
on
her
knees
again
rocking
backwards
and
forwards
ah
why
she
cried
why
is
the
world
so
unfair
why
when
there
is
sin
and
sorrow
why
does
the
punishment
fall
all
on
the
woman
and
the
man
go
free
i
am
here
in
disgrace
and
humiliation
in
shame
and
sorrow
in
fear
of
losing
my
home
my
husband
it
may
even
be
my
life
while
he
who
was
a
thousand
times
more
guilty
than
i
was
is
welcomed
flattered
courted
it
is
cruel
and
unjust
i
have
told
you
she
said
how
hard
my
childhood
was
how
lonely
and
desolate
and
miserable
i
was
with
my
girl
heart
full
of
love
and
no
one
to
love
when
i
was
eighteen
i
went
to
live
with
a
very
wealthy
family
in
london
the
name
i
will
not
hide
one
detail
from
you
the
name
was
cleveland
they
had
one
little
girl
and
i
was
her
governess
i
went
with
them
to
their
place
in
the
country
and
there
a
visitor
came
to
them
a
handsome
young
nobleman
lord
dacius
by
name
it
was
a
beautiful
sunlit
county
i
had
little
to
do
plenty
of
leisure
and
he
could
do
as
he
would
with
his
time
we
had
met
and
had
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
i
did
not
love
him
i
idolized
him
remember
in
your
judgment
that
no
one
had
ever
loved
me
no
one
had
ever
kissed
my
face
and
said
kind
words
to
me
and
i
oh
wretched
miserable
me
i
was
in
heaven
to
be
loved
for
the
first
time
and
by
one
so
handsome
so
charming
so
fascinating
a
few
weeks
passed
like
a
dream
i
met
him
in
the
early
morning
i
met
him
in
the
gloaming
he
swore
a
hundred
times
each
day
that
he
would
marry
me
when
he
came
of
age
we
must
wait
until
then
i
never
dreamed
of
harm
or
wrong
i
believed
in
him
implicitly
as
i
loved
him
i
believe
every
word
that
came
from
his
lips
may
heaven
spare
me
i
need
tell
you
no
more
a
girl
of
eighteen
madly
passionately
in
love
a
girl
as
ignorant
as
any
girl
could
be
and
a
handsome
experienced
man
of
the
world
there
was
no
hope
no
chance
i
fell
yet
almost
without
knowing
how
i
had
fallen
you
will
spare
me
the
rest
i
know
when
in
my
sore
anguish
and
distress
i
went
to
him
i
thought
he
would
marry
me
at
once
i
thought
he
would
be
longing
only
to
make
me
happy
again
to
comfort
me
to
solace
me
to
make
amends
for
all
i
had
suffered
i
went
to
him
in
london
with
my
heart
full
of
longing
and
love
i
had
left
my
situation
and
my
stern
cruel
grandmother
believed
that
i
had
found
another
if
i
lived
to
be
a
thousand
years
old
i
should
never
forget
my
horror
and
surprise
he
had
worshipped
me
he
had
sworn
a
thousand
times
over
that
he
would
marry
me
he
had
loved
me
with
the
tenderest
love
now
when
after
waiting
some
hours
i
saw
him
last
he
frowned
at
me
there
was
no
kiss
no
caress
no
welcome
is
a
nice
piece
of
news
he
said
comes
of
country
visiting
you
love
me
you
love
me
i
cried
did
my
dear
he
said
of
course
that
died
with
summer
one
does
not
speak
of
what
is
dead
you
not
mean
to
marry
me
i
asked
certainly
not
and
you
know
that
i
never
did
it
was
a
amusement
what
is
it
to
me
i
asked
you
must
make
the
best
of
it
of
course
i
will
not
see
you
want
but
you
must
not
annoy
me
and
that
old
grandmother
of
yours
she
must
not
be
let
loose
upon
me
you
must
do
the
best
you
can
i
will
give
you
a
hundred
pounds
if
you
will
promise
not
to
come
near
me
again
i
spoke
no
word
to
him
i
did
not
reproach
him
i
did
not
utter
his
name
i
did
not
say
to
him
i
walked
away
i
leave
his
punishment
to
heaven
then
i
crushed
the
anguish
within
me
and
tried
to
look
my
life
in
the
face
i
would
have
killed
myself
rather
than
have
gone
home
my
grandmother
had
forced
me
to
be
saving
and
in
the
postoffice
bank
i
had
nearly
thirty
pounds
i
had
a
watch
and
chain
worth
ten
i
sold
them
and
i
sold
with
them
a
small
diamond
ring
that
had
been
my
mother
and
some
other
jewelry
altogether
i
realized
fifty
pounds
i
went
to
the
outskirts
of
london
and
took
two
small
rooms
i
remember
that
i
made
no
effort
to
hide
my
disgrace
i
did
not
pretend
to
be
married
or
to
be
a
widow
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
not
unkind
to
me
she
liked
me
all
the
better
for
telling
the
truth
i
say
no
word
to
you
of
my
mental
anguish
no
words
can
describe
it
but
i
loved
the
little
one
she
was
only
three
weeks
old
when
a
letter
was
forwarded
to
me
at
the
address
i
had
given
in
london
saying
that
my
grandmother
was
ill
and
wished
me
to
go
home
at
once
what
was
i
to
do
with
the
baby
i
can
remember
how
the
great
drops
of
anguish
stood
on
my
face
how
my
hands
trembled
how
my
very
heart
went
cold
with
dread
the
newspapers
which
i
took
daily
to
read
the
advertisements
for
governesses
lay
upon
the
table
and
my
eyes
were
caught
by
an
advertisement
from
some
woman
living
at
brighton
who
undertook
the
bringing
up
of
children
i
resolved
to
go
down
that
very
day
i
said
nothing
to
my
landlady
of
my
intention
i
merely
told
her
that
i
was
going
to
place
the
little
one
in
very
good
hands
and
that
i
would
return
for
my
luggage
i
meant
so
truly
as
heaven
hears
me
speak
i
meant
to
do
right
by
the
little
child
i
meant
to
work
hard
to
keep
her
in
a
nice
home
oh
i
meant
well
i
was
ashamed
to
go
out
in
the
streets
with
a
little
baby
in
my
arms
shall
i
do
if
it
cries
i
asked
the
kindly
landlady
can
prevent
it
from
crying
she
said
it
some
cordial
cordial
i
asked
and
she
told
me
it
hurt
the
little
one
i
asked
again
and
she
laughed
she
replied
not
half
the
mothers
in
london
give
it
to
their
children
it
sends
them
into
a
sound
sleep
and
they
wake
up
none
the
worse
for
it
if
you
give
the
baby
just
a
little
it
will
sleep
all
the
way
to
brighton
and
you
will
have
no
trouble
i
must
say
this
much
for
myself
that
i
knew
nothing
whatever
of
children
that
is
of
such
little
children
i
had
never
been
where
there
was
a
baby
so
little
as
my
own
i
bought
the
cordial
and
just
before
i
started
gave
the
baby
some
i
thought
that
i
was
very
careful
i
meant
to
be
so
i
would
not
for
the
whole
world
have
given
my
baby
one
too
much
it
soon
slept
a
calm
placid
sleep
and
i
noticed
that
the
little
face
grew
paler
baby
is
dying
said
a
woman
who
was
traveling
in
the
carriage
with
me
is
dying
i
am
sure
i
laughed
and
cried
it
was
so
utterly
impossible
i
thought
it
was
well
and
smiling
only
one
hour
ago
i
never
remembered
the
cordial
afterwards
when
i
came
to
make
inquiries
i
found
that
i
had
given
her
too
much
i
need
not
linger
on
details
you
see
that
if
my
little
one
died
by
my
fault
it
was
most
unconscious
on
my
part
it
was
most
innocently
most
ignorantly
done
i
make
no
excuse
i
tell
you
the
plain
truth
as
it
stands
i
caused
my
baby
death
but
it
was
most
innocently
done
i
would
have
given
my
own
life
to
have
brought
hers
back
you
my
judge
can
you
imagine
any
fate
more
terrible
than
standing
quite
alone
on
the
brighton
platform
with
a
dead
child
in
my
arms
i
had
very
little
money
i
knew
no
soul
in
the
place
i
had
no
more
idea
what
to
do
with
a
dead
child
than
a
baby
would
have
had
i
call
it
dead
she
continued
for
i
believe
it
to
have
been
dead
no
matter
what
any
doctor
says
it
was
cold
oh
my
heaven
how
cold
lifeless
no
breath
passed
the
little
lips
the
eyes
were
closed
the
pretty
hand
stiff
i
believed
it
dead
i
wandered
down
to
the
beach
and
sat
down
on
the
stones
what
was
i
to
do
with
this
sweet
cold
body
i
cried
until
i
was
almost
blind
in
the
whole
wide
world
there
was
no
one
so
utterly
desolate
and
wretched
i
cried
aloud
to
heaven
to
help
me
where
should
i
bury
my
little
child
i
can
not
tell
how
the
idea
first
occurred
to
me
the
waves
came
in
with
a
soft
murmuring
melody
a
sweet
silvery
hush
and
i
thought
the
deep
green
sea
would
make
a
grave
for
my
little
one
it
was
mad
and
wicked
i
know
now
i
can
see
how
horrible
it
was
it
did
not
seem
to
be
so
then
i
only
thought
of
the
sea
then
as
my
best
friend
the
place
where
i
was
to
hide
the
beloved
little
body
the
clear
green
grave
where
she
was
to
sleep
until
the
judgment
day
i
waited
until
it
is
a
horrible
thing
to
tell
you
but
i
fell
asleep
fast
asleep
and
of
all
the
horrors
in
my
story
the
worst
part
is
that
sitting
by
the
sea
fast
asleep
myself
with
my
little
dead
babe
on
my
knee
when
i
awoke
the
tide
was
coming
in
full
and
soft
and
waves
the
sun
had
set
and
a
thick
soft
gloom
had
fallen
over
everything
and
then
i
knew
the
time
had
come
for
what
i
wanted
to
do
chapter
xii
i
went
on
to
the
chain
pier
i
had
kissed
the
little
face
for
the
last
time
i
had
wrapped
the
pretty
white
body
in
the
shawl
i
said
all
the
prayers
i
could
remember
as
i
walked
along
the
pier
it
was
the
most
solemn
of
burial
services
to
me
i
went
to
the
side
of
the
pier
i
can
not
understand
how
it
was
that
i
did
not
see
you
i
stood
there
some
few
minutes
and
then
i
took
the
little
bundle
i
raised
it
gently
and
let
it
fall
into
the
sea
but
my
baby
was
dead
i
swear
to
that
oh
heaven
if
i
dared
if
i
dared
fling
myself
in
the
same
green
briny
waves
i
was
mad
with
anguish
i
went
back
to
my
lodging
the
landlady
asked
me
if
i
had
left
the
baby
in
brighton
and
i
answered
i
do
not
know
how
the
days
went
on
i
could
not
tell
you
i
was
never
myself
nor
do
i
remember
much
until
some
weeks
afterward
i
went
home
to
my
grandmother
who
died
soon
after
i
reached
her
i
need
not
tell
you
that
afterwards
i
met
lance
and
learned
to
love
him
with
all
my
heart
do
not
tell
him
promise
me
i
beseech
you
for
mercy
sake
do
not
tell
him
what
you
have
told
me
i
said
certainly
gives
a
different
aspect
to
the
whole
affair
i
will
make
no
promise
i
will
think
it
over
i
must
have
time
to
decide
what
is
best
you
will
spare
me
she
went
on
you
see
i
did
no
one
any
harm
wrong
or
injury
if
i
hurt
another
then
you
might
deprive
me
of
my
husband
and
my
home
as
it
is
lance
loves
me
and
i
love
him
you
will
not
tell
him
i
will
think
about
it
i
replied
but
i
can
not
live
in
this
suspense
she
cried
if
you
will
tell
him
tell
him
this
day
this
hour
he
might
forgive
you
i
said
no
he
would
not
be
angry
he
would
not
reproach
me
but
he
would
never
look
upon
my
face
again
would
it
not
be
better
for
you
to
tell
him
yourself
i
suggested
oh
no
she
cried
with
a
shudder
no
i
shall
never
tell
him
i
do
not
say
that
i
shall
i
said
give
me
a
few
days
only
a
few
days
and
i
will
decide
in
my
mind
all
about
it
then
we
saw
lance
in
the
distance
there
is
my
husband
she
said
do
i
look
very
ill
mr
ford
you
do
indeed
you
look
ghastly
i
said
i
will
go
and
meet
him
she
said
the
exercise
and
the
fresh
air
brought
some
little
color
to
her
face
before
they
met
still
he
cried
out
that
i
had
not
taken
care
of
her
that
she
was
overtired
that
is
it
she
replied
i
have
been
all
day
i
think
my
head
aches
i
have
had
a
strange
sensation
of
dizziness
in
it
i
am
tired
oh
lance
i
am
so
tired
i
shall
not
leave
you
again
said
lance
to
her
and
i
fancied
he
was
not
quite
pleased
with
me
and
thought
i
had
neglected
her
we
all
three
went
home
together
fleming
did
not
say
much
but
she
kept
up
better
than
i
thought
she
could
have
done
i
heard
her
that
same
evening
express
a
wish
to
be
driven
to
vale
royal
on
the
day
following
a
young
girl
whom
she
had
been
instrumental
in
saving
from
ruin
had
been
suddenly
taken
ill
and
wanted
to
see
her
my
darling
lance
said
you
do
not
seem
to
me
strong
enough
let
me
persuade
you
to
rest
tomorrow
i
should
like
to
see
rose
winter
again
before
before
i
then
she
stopped
abruptly
before
you
what
frances
he
asked
i
mean
she
said
that
i
should
like
to
see
rose
before
she
grows
worse
i
think
you
ought
to
rest
but
you
shall
do
as
you
like
frances
you
always
do
i
will
drive
you
over
myself
i
saw
them
start
on
the
following
morning
and
then
i
tried
to
think
over
in
solitude
what
it
would
be
best
to
do
her
story
certainly
altered
facts
very
considerably
she
was
not
a
murderess
as
i
had
believed
her
to
be
if
the
death
of
the
little
hapless
child
was
attributable
to
an
overdose
of
the
cordial
she
had
certainly
not
given
it
purposely
could
i
judge
her
yet
an
honest
loyal
man
like
lance
ought
not
to
be
so
cruelly
deceived
i
felt
sure
myself
that
if
she
spoke
to
him
if
she
told
him
her
story
with
the
same
pathos
with
which
she
had
told
it
to
me
he
would
forgive
her
he
must
forgive
her
i
could
not
reconcile
it
with
my
conscience
to
keep
silence
i
could
not
and
i
believed
that
the
truth
might
be
told
with
safety
so
after
long
thinking
and
deliberation
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
lance
must
know
and
that
she
must
tell
him
herself
it
was
in
the
middle
of
a
bright
sunshiny
afternoon
when
they
returned
when
lance
brought
his
wife
into
the
he
seemed
very
anxious
over
her
frances
does
not
seem
well
he
said
to
me
ring
the
bell
john
and
order
some
hot
tea
she
is
as
cold
as
death
her
eyes
met
mine
and
in
them
i
read
the
question
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
was
struck
by
her
dreadful
pallor
is
your
head
bad
again
today
i
asked
yes
it
aches
very
much
she
replied
the
hot
tea
came
and
it
seemed
to
revive
her
but
after
a
few
minutes
the
dreadful
shivering
came
over
her
again
she
stood
up
lance
she
said
i
will
go
to
my
room
and
you
must
lead
me
my
head
aches
so
that
i
am
blind
she
left
her
pretty
never
to
it
the
next
day
at
noon
lance
came
to
me
with
a
sad
face
john
my
wife
is
very
ill
and
i
have
just
heard
bad
news
what
is
it
lance
i
asked
why
that
the
girl
she
went
yesterday
to
see
rose
winter
is
ill
with
the
most
malignant
type
of
i
looked
at
him
in
horror
do
you
think
i
gasped
that
the
that
fleming
has
caught
it
i
am
quite
sure
he
replied
i
have
just
sent
for
the
doctor
and
have
telegraphed
to
the
hospital
for
two
nurses
and
my
old
friend
he
added
i
am
afraid
it
is
going
to
be
a
bad
case
it
was
a
bad
case
i
never
left
him
while
the
suspense
lasted
but
it
was
soon
over
she
suffered
intensely
for
the
disease
was
of
the
most
virulent
type
it
was
soon
over
lance
came
to
me
one
afternoon
and
i
read
the
verdict
in
his
face
she
will
die
he
said
hoarsely
they
can
not
save
her
and
the
day
after
that
he
came
to
me
again
with
wistful
eyes
john
he
said
slowly
my
wife
is
dying
and
she
wants
to
see
you
will
you
see
her
most
certainly
i
replied
she
smiled
when
she
saw
me
and
beckoned
me
to
her
ah
poor
soul
her
judgment
had
indeed
been
taken
from
me
she
whispered
to
me
promise
me
that
you
will
never
tell
him
i
am
dying
he
need
never
know
now
will
you
promise
me
i
promised
and
she
died
i
have
kept
my
promise
lance
fleming
knows
nothing
of
what
i
have
told
you
only
heaven
knows
how
far
she
sinned
or
was
sinned
against

never
see
the
sunset
or
hear
the
waves
come
rolling
in

thinking
