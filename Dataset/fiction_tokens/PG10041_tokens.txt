in
the
middle
of
the
cupboard
door
was
the
carved
figure
of
a
man
he
had
goat
legs
little
horns
on
his
head
and
a
long
beard
the
children
in
the
room
called
him
he
was
always
looking
at
the
table
under
the
where
stood
a
very
pretty
little
shepherdess
made
of
china
close
by
her
side
stood
a
little
as
black
as
coal
and
also
made
of
china
near
to
them
stood
another
figure
he
was
an
old
chinaman
who
could
nod
his
head
and
used
to
pretend
he
was
the
grandfather
of
the
shepherdess
although
he
could
not
prove
it
he
however
assumed
authority
over
her
and
therefore
when
asked
for
the
little
shepherdess
to
be
his
wife
he
nodded
his
head
to
show
that
he
consented
then
the
little
shepherdess
cried
and
looked
at
her
sweetheart
the
i
must
entreat
you
said
she
to
go
out
with
me
into
the
wide
world
for
we
can
not
stay
here
when
the
saw
that
she
was
quite
firm
he
said
my
way
is
through
the
stove
up
the
chimney
so
at
last
they
reached
the
top
of
the
chimney
the
sky
with
all
its
stars
was
over
their
heads
they
could
see
for
a
very
long
distance
out
into
the
wide
world
and
the
poor
little
shepherdess
leaned
her
head
on
her
shoulder
and
wept
this
is
too
much
she
said
the
world
is
too
large
and
so
with
a
great
deal
of
trouble
they
climbed
down
the
chimney
and
peeped
out
there
lay
the
old
chinaman
on
the
floor
broken
into
three
pieces
this
is
terrible
said
the
shepherdess
he
can
be
riveted
said
the
the
family
had
the
chinaman
back
mended
and
a
strong
rivet
put
through
his
neck
he
looked
as
good
as
new
but
when
again
asked
for
the
shepherdess
to
be
his
wife
the
old
chinaman
could
no
longer
nod
his
head
and
so
the
little
china
people
remained
together
and
were
thankful
for
the
rivet
in
grandfather
neck
and
continued
to
love
each
other
until
they
were
broken
to
pieces
part
one
propinquity
a
singer
eh
well
well
but
when
he
sings
take
jealous
heed
lest
idiosyncrasies
entinge
and
taint
too
deep
his
melodies
see
that
his
lute
has
no
discordant
strings
to
harrow
us
and
let
his
vaporings
be
all
of
virtue
and
its
victories
and

paul
verville
i
at
a
very
remote
period
when
editorials
were
mostly
devoted
to
discussion
as
to
whether
the
democratic
convention
shortly
to
be
held
in
chicago
would
or
would
not
declare
in
favor
of
when
golf
was
a
novel
form
of
recreation
in
america
and
people
disputed
how
to
pronounce
its
name
and
pedestrians
still
turned
to
stare
after
an
automobile
when
according
to
the
fashion
notes
the
godet
skirts
and
huge
sleeves
of
the
present
modes
were
already
doomed
to
extinction
when
the
baseball
season
had
just
begun
and
some
of
our
people
were
discussing
the
national
game
and
others
the
spectacular
burning
of
the
old
pennsylvania
railway
depot
at
and
market
street
in
philadelphia
and
yet
others
the
significance
of
general
fitzhugh
recent
appointment
as
to
habana
at
this
remote
time
lichfield
talked
of
nothing
except
the
pendomer
divorce
case
and
colonel
rudolph
musgrave
had
very
narrowly
escaped
being
named
as
the
this
much
at
least
all
lichfield
knew
when
george
pendomer
evincing
unsuspected
funds
of
generosity
permitted
his
wife
to
secure
a
divorce
on
the
euphemistic
grounds
of
desertion
john
charteris
acting
as
rudolph
musgrave
friend
had
patched
up
this
arrangement
and
the
colonel
and
pendomer
so
rumor
ran
were
to
be
married
very
quietly
after
a
decent
interval
remained
only
to
deliberate
whether
this
sop
to
the
conventions
should
be
accepted
as
sufficient
at
least
as
ashmeade
sagely
observed
we
can
combine
vituperation
with
and
remember
it
is
not
the
first
time
a
musgrave
has
figured
in
an
entanglement
of
the
sort
a
lecherous
race
proverbial
flutterers
of
petticoats
his
surname
convicts
the
man
unheard
and
almost
excuses
him
all
of
us
feel
that
and
moreover
it
is
not
as
if
the
idiots
had
committed
any
unpardonable
sin
for
they
have
kept
out
of
the
newspapers
her
friend
seemed
dubious
and
hazarded
something
concerning
the
merest
sense
of
decency
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
figs
people
i
mean
the
people
who
count
in
lichfield
are
charitable
enough
to
ignore
almost
any
crime
which
is
just
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
in
fact
they
are
mildly
grateful
it
gives
them
something
to
talk
about
but
when
detraction
is
printed
in
the
morning
paper
you
ca
overlook
it
without
incurring
the
suspicion
of
being
illiterate
and
virtueless
that
lichfield
but
polly
sophist
do
i
know
my
lichfield
i
know
it
almost
as
well
as
i
know
rudolph
musgrave
and
so
i
prophesy
that
he
will
not
marry
clarice
pendomer
because
he
is
inevitably
tired
of
her
by
this
he
will
marry
money
just
as
all
the
musgraves
do
moreover
i
prophesy
that
we
will
gabble
about
this
mess
until
we
find
a
newer
target
for
our
stone
throwing
and
be
just
as
friendly
with
the
participants
to
their
faces
as
we
ever
were
so
do
let
me
hear
any
idiotic
talk
about
whether
or
no
am
going
to
receive
her
well
after
all
she
was
born
a
bellingham
we
must
remember
that
was
i
saying
i
knew
my
lichfield
ashmeade
placidly
observed
and
time
indeed
attested
her
to
be
right
in
every
particular
yet
it
must
be
recorded
that
at
this
critical
juncture
chance
rather
remarkably
favored
colonel
musgrave
and
pendomer
by
giving
lichfield
something
of
greater
interest
to
talk
about
since
now
just
in
the
nick
of
occasion
occurred
the
notorious
scott
musgrave
murder
scott
musgrave
a
fourth
cousin
once
removed
of
the
colonel
to
be
quite
accurate
had
in
the
preceding
year
seduced
the
daughter
of
a
village
doctor
a
negligible
up
country
at
warren
and
her
two
brothers
being
irritated
picked
this
particular
season
to
waylay
him
in
the
street
as
he
reeled
homeward
one
night
from
the
commodores
club
and
forthwith
to
abolish
scott
musgrave
after
the
primitive
methods
of
their
lower
station
in
society
these
details
indeed
were
never
officially
made
public
since
a
discreet
police
force
found
no
clues
for
fred
musgrave
of
garden
as
befitted
the
dead
man
brother
had
been
at
no
little
pains
to
insure
constabulary
shortsightedness
in
preference
to
having
the
nature
of
scott
musgrave
recreations
unsympathetically
aired
fred
musgrave
thereby
afforded
lichfield
a
delectable
opportunity
conversationally
and
abetted
by
innumerable
they
say
to
accredit
the
murder
turn
by
turn
to
every
person
residing
within
stone
throw
of
its
commission
so
that
few
had
time
now
to
talk
of
rudolph
musgrave
and
clarice
pendomer
for
it
was
not
in
lichfieldian
human
nature
to
discuss
a
mere
domestic
imbroglio
when
here
also
in
the
musgrave
family
was
a
picturesque
and
gory
assassination
to
lay
tongue
to
so
colonel
musgrave
was
duly
reëlected
that
spring
to
the
librarianship
of
the
lichfield
historical
association
and
the
name
of
george
pendomer
was
not
stricken
from
the
list
of
patronesses
of
the
lichfield
german
club
but
was
merely
altered
to
clarice
pendomer
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
colonel
musgrave
was
a
trifle
irritated
that
his
should
be
thus
unrewarded
by
martyrdom
circumstances
had
enabled
him
to
assume
and
he
had
gladly
accepted
the
blame
for
john
charteris
iniquity
rather
than
let
anne
charteris
know
the
truth
about
her
husband
and
clarice
pendomer
the
truth
would
have
killed
anne
the
colonel
believed
and
besides
the
colonel
had
enjoyed
the
performance
of
a
picturesque
action
and
having
acted
as
a
hero
in
permitting
himself
to
be
pilloried
as
a
libertine
it
was
preferable
of
course
not
to
have
incurred
ostracism
thereby
his
conceded
this
and
yet
to
colonel
musgrave
it
could
not
but
be
evident
that
destiny
was
hardly
rising
to
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
ii
concerning
colonel
musgrave
one
finds
the
ensuing
account
in
a
publication
of
the
period
devoted
to
biographies
of
more
or
less
prominent
americans
it
is
reproduced
unchanged
because
these
memoirs
were
in
the
old
days
compiled
by
the
person
whom
they
commemorated
the
custom
was
a
worthy
one
since
the
value
of
an
autobiography
is
determined
by
the
nature
of
its
superfluities
and
falsehoods

for

was
by
birth
the
lineal
head
of
all
the
musgraves
of
matocton
which
is
in
lichfield
as
degrees
are
counted
there
equivalent
to
what
being
born
a
marquis
would
mean
in
england
handsome
and
trim
and
affable
he
defied
chronology
by
looking
ten
years
younger
than
he
was
known
to
be
for
at
least
a
decade
he
had
been
invaluable
to
lichfield
matrons
alike
against
the
entertainment
of
an
girl
the
management
of
a
cotillion
and
the
prevention
of
unpleasant
pauses
among
incongruous
dinner
companies
in
short
he
was
by
all
accounts
the
social
triumph
of
his
generation
and
his
military
title
won
by
four
years
of
arduous
service
at
receptions
and
parades
while
on
the
staff
of
a
former
governor
of
the
state
this
seasoned
bachelor
carried
off
with
plausibility
and
distinction
the
story
finds
him
librarian
and
corresponding
secretary
of
the
lichfield
historical
association
which
office
he
had
held
for
some
six
years
the
salary
was
small
and
the
colonel
had
inherited
little
but
his
sister
miss
agatha
musgrave
who
lived
with
him
was
a
notable
housekeeper
he
increased
his
resources
in
a
gentlemanly
fashion
by
genealogical
research
directed
mostly
toward
the
rehabilitation
of
ambiguous
pedigrees
and
for
the
rest
no
other
man
could
have
fulfilled
more
gracefully
the
main
duty
of
the
librarian
which
was
to
exhibit
the
association
collection
of
relics
to
hurried
tourists
doing
lichfield
his
library
manner
was
modeled
upon
that
which
an
eighteenth
century
portrait
would
conceivably
possess
should
witchcraft
set
the
canvas
breathing
iii
also
the
story
finds
colonel
musgrave
in
the
company
of
his
sister
on
a
warm
april
day
whilst
these
two
sat
upon
the
porch
of
the
musgrave
home
in
lichfield
and
colonel
musgrave
waited
until
it
should
be
time
to
open
the
library
for
the
afternoon
and
about
them
birds
twittered
cheerily
and
the
formal
garden
flourished
as
gardens
thrive
nowhere
except
in
lichfield
and
overhead
the
sky
was
a
save
for
a
few
irrelevant
clouds
which
dappled
it
here
and
there
like
splashes
of
whipped
cream
yet
for
all
this
the
colonel
was
and
care
was
on
his
brow
and
venom
in
his
speech
and
one
thing
colonel
musgrave
concluded
with
decision
i
wish
distinctly
understood
and
that
is
if
she
insists
on
having
young
men
loafing
about
her
as
of
course
she
will
she
will
have
to
entertain
them
in
the
garden
i
wo
have
them
in
the
house
agatha
you
remember
that
langham
girl
you
had
here
last
easter
he
added
disconsolately
the
one
who
positively
littered
up
the
house
with
young
men
and
sang
idiotic
jingles
to
them
at
all
hours
of
the
night
about
the
bailey
family
and
the
correct
way
to
spell
chicken
she
drove
me
to
the
verge
of
insanity
and
i
have
a
doubt
that
this
patricia
person
will
be
quite
as
obstreperous
so
please
mention
it
to
her
agatha
casually
of
course
that
in
lichfield
when
one
is
partial
to
either
vocal
exercise
or
amorous
daliance
the
proper
scene
of
action
is
the
garden
i
really
can
not
be
annoyed
by
her
but
rudolph
his
sister
protested
you
forget
she
is
engaged
to
the
earl
of
pevensey
an
engaged
girl
naturally
would
care
about
meeting
any
young
men
h
said
the
colonel
drily
ensued
a
pause
during
which
the
colonel
lighted
yet
another
cigarette
then
i
have
frequently
observed
he
spoke
in
absent
wise
that
all
young
women
having
that
peculiarly
vacuous
expression
about
the
eyes
i
believe
there
are
misguided
persons
who
describe
such
eyes
as
being
are
invariably
possessed
of
a
fickle
unstable
and
coquettish
temperament
oh
no
you
may
depend
upon
it
agatha
the
fact
that
she
contemplates
purchasing
the
right
to
support
a
peculiarly
disreputable
member
of
the
british
peerage
will
not
hinder
her
in
the
least
from
making
advances
to
all
the
young
men
in
the
neighborhood
miss
musgrave
was
somewhat
ruffled
she
was
a
homely
little
woman
with
nothing
of
the
ordinary
musgrave
comeliness
candor
even
compels
the
statement
that
in
her
pudgy
swarthy
face
there
was
a
droll
suggestion
of
the
i
am
sure
miss
musgrave
remonstrated
with
placid
dignity
that
you
know
nothing
whatever
about
her
and
that
the
reports
about
the
earl
have
probably
been
greatly
exaggerated
and
that
her
picture
shows
her
to
be
an
unusually
attractive
girl
though
it
is
true
miss
musgrave
conceded
after
reflection
that
there
are
any
number
of
persons
in
the
house
of
lords
that
i
would
in
the
least
care
to
have
in
my
own
house
even
with
the
front
parlor
all
in
linen
as
it
unfortunately
is
so
awkward
when
you
have
company
and
the
bible
does
bid
us
not
to
put
our
trust
in
princes
and
for
my
part
i
never
thought
that
photographs
could
be
trusted
either
scorn
not
the
nobly
born
agatha
her
brother
admonished
her
nor
treat
with
lofty
scorn
the
the
very
best
people
are
sometimes
respectable
and
yet
he
pursued
with
a
slight
hiatus
of
thought
i
should
not
describe
her
as
precisely
an
girl
she
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
hair
if
it
is
all
her
own
which
it
probably
is
and
her
nose
is
apparently
straight
enough
and
i
gather
she
is
not
absolutely
deformed
anywhere
but
that
is
all
i
can
conscientiously
say
in
her
favor
she
is
artificial
her
hair
now
it
has
a
well
you
would
not
call
it
exactly
a
crinkle
or
precisely
a
wave
but
rather
somewhere
between
the
two
yes
i
think
i
should
describe
it
as
a
ripple
i
fancy
it
must
be
rather
like
the
reflection
of
a
sunset
in
a
say
with
a
faint
wind
ruffling
the
water
for
i
gather
that
her
hair
is
of
some
light
shade
induced
i
have
a
doubt
by
the
liberal
use
of
peroxides
and
this
ripple
too
agatha
it
stands
to
reason
must
be
the
result
of
coercing
nature
for
i
have
never
seen
it
in
any
other
woman
hair
moreover
colonel
musgrave
continued
warming
somewhat
to
his
subject
there
is
a
dimple
on
the
right
side
of
her
mouth
immediately
above
it
which
speaks
of
the
most
frivolous
tendencies
i
dare
say
it
comes
and
goes
when
she
talks
winks
at
you
so
to
speak
in
a
manner
that
must
be
simply
idiotic
that
foolish
little
cleft
in
her
chin
too
but
at
this
point
his
sister
interrupted
him
i
had
a
notion
said
she
that
you
had
even
looked
at
the
photograph
and
you
seem
to
have
it
quite
by
heart
rudolph
and
some
people
admire
dimples
you
know
and
at
any
rate
her
mother
had
red
hair
so
patricia
is
really
responsible
i
decided
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
use
the
best
mats
we
can
save
them
for
sunday
supper
because
i
am
only
going
to
have
eggs
and
a
little
cold
meat
and
not
make
company
of
her
for
no
apparent
reason
rudolph
musgrave
flushed
i
inspected
it
quite
casually
last
night
please
do
be
absurd
agatha
if
we
were
threatened
with
any
other
direful
visitation
influenza
say
or
the
locust
i
should
naturally
read
up
on
the
subject
in
order
to
know
what
to
expect
and
since
providence
has
seen
fit
to
send
us
a
visitor
rather
than
a
visitation
though
personally
i
should
infinitely
prefer
the
influenza
as
interfering
in
less
degree
with
my
comfort
i
have
of
course
neglected
no
opportunity
of
finding
out
what
we
may
reasonably
look
forward
to
i
fear
the
worst
agatha
for
i
repeat
the
girl
face
is
to
me
absolutely
unattractive
the
colonel
spoke
with
emphasis
and
flung
away
his
cigarette
and
took
up
his
hat
to
go
and
then
i
suppose
said
miss
musgrave
absently
you
will
be
falling
in
love
with
her
just
as
you
did
with
anne
charteris
and
aline
van
orden
and
all
those
other
minxes
i
like
to
see
you
married
rudolph
only
i
could
stand
your
having
a
wife
i
i
sputtered
the
colonel
i
think
you
must
be
out
of
your
head
i
fall
in
love
with
that
chit
good
lord
agatha
you
are
positively
idiotic
and
the
colonel
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
stiffly
through
the
garden
but
when
down
the
path
he
wheeled
about
and
came
back
i
beg
your
pardon
agatha
he
said
contritely
it
was
not
my
intention
to
be
discourteous
but
somehow
somehow
dear
i
do
quite
see
the
necessity
for
my
falling
in
love
with
anybody
so
long
as
i
have
you
and
miss
musgrave
you
may
be
sure
forgave
him
promptly
and
afterward
with
a
bit
of
pride
and
an
infinity
of
love
in
her
kind
homely
face
her
eyes
followed
him
out
of
the
garden
on
his
way
to
open
the
library
and
she
decided
in
her
heart
that
she
had
the
dearest
and
best
and
handsomest
brother
in
the
universe
and
that
she
must
remember
to
tell
him
accidentally
how
becoming
his
new
hat
was
and
then
at
some
unspoken
thought
she
smiled
wistfully
she
would
be
a
very
lucky
girl
if
he
did
said
miss
musgrave
apropos
of
nothing
in
particular
and
tossed
her
grizzly
head
an
earl
indeed
said
miss
musgrave
iv
and
this
is
how
it
came
about
patricia
vartrey
a
second
cousin
once
removed
of
colonel
rudolph
musgrave
as
the
older
inhabitants
of
lichfield
will
volubly
attest
was
always
a
person
who
did
peculiar
things
the
list
of
her
eccentricities
is
far
too
lengthy
here
to
be
enumerated
but
she
began
it
by
being
born
with
red
hair
titian
reds
and
auburns
were
undiscovered
euphemisms
in
those
days
and
in
lichfield
this
is
not
regarded
as
precisely
a
thing
to
do
and
she
ended
it
as
far
as
lichfield
was
concerned
by
eloping
with
what
lichfield
in
its
horror
could
only
describe
with
conscious
inadequacy
as
a
quite
person
indisputably
the
man
was
already
and
from
this
nightmarish
of
reconstruction
the
fellow
visibly
was
plucking
wealth
also
young
stapylton
was
well
enough
to
look
at
too
as
lichfield
flurriedly
conceded
but
it
was
equally
undeniable
that
he
had
made
his
money
through
a
series
of
commercial
speculations
distinguished
both
by
shiftiness
and
daring
and
that
the
man
himself
had
been
until
the
war
a
wholly
negligible
poor
white
person
an
overseer
indeed
for
wild
will
musgrave
colonel
musgrave
father
who
was
of
course
the
same
william
sebastian
musgrave
that
met
his
death
at
gettysburg
this
upstart
married
patricia
vartrey
for
all
the
chatter
and
whispering
and
carried
her
away
from
lichfield
as
yet
a
little
dubious
as
to
what
recognition
if
any
should
be
accorded
the
existence
of
the
stapyltons
and
afterward
from
a
notoriously
untruthful
north
indeed
came
rumors
that
he
was
rapidly
becoming
wealthy
and
of
patricia
vartrey
death
at
her
daughter
birth
and
of
the
infant
health
and
strength
and
beauty
and
of
her
lavish
upbringing
a
frenchwoman
lichfield
whispered
with
absolutely
nothing
to
do
but
attend
upon
the
child
and
then
little
by
little
a
new
generation
sprang
up
and
little
by
little
the
interest
these
rumors
waked
became
more
lax
and
it
was
brought
about
at
last
by
the
insidious
transitions
of
time
that
patricia
vartrey
was
forgotten
in
lichfield
only
a
few
among
the
older
men
remembered
her
some
of
them
yet
treasured
as
these
fogies
so
often
do
a
stray
fan
or
an
odd
glove
and
in
bycorners
of
sundry
hearts
there
lurked
the
memory
of
a
laughing
word
or
of
a
glance
or
of
some
such
casual
bounty
that
patricia
vartrey
had
accorded
these
hearts
owners
when
the
world
was
young
but
agatha
musgrave
likewise
remembered
the
orphan
cousin
who
had
been
reared
with
her
she
had
loved
patricia
vartrey
and
in
due
time
she
wrote
to
patricia
daughter
in
stately
antiquated
phrases
that
astonished
the
recipient
not
a
little
and
the
girl
had
answered
the
correspondence
flourished
and
it
was
not
long
before
miss
musgrave
had
induced
her
young
cousin
to
visit
lichfield
colonel
rudolph
musgrave
be
it
understood
knew
nothing
of
all
this
until
the
girl
was
actually
on
her
way
and
now
she
was
to
arrive
that
afternoon
to
domicile
herself
in
his
quiet
house
for
two
long
weeks
this
utter
stranger
look
you
and
upset
his
comfort
ask
him
silly
questions
expect
him
to
talk
to
her
and
at
the
end
of
her
visit
possibly
present
him
with
some
outlandish
gimcrack
made
of
cardboard
and
pink
ribbons
in
which
she
would
expect
him
to
keep
his
papers
the
langham
girl
did
that
it
is
honesty
part
to
give
you
the
man
no
better
than
he
was
lichfield
at
large
had
pampered
him
many
women
had
loved
him
and
above
all
miss
agatha
had
spoiled
him
after
fifteen
years
of
being
the
pivot
about
which
the
economy
of
a
household
revolves
after
fifteen
years
of
being
the
inevitable
person
whose
approval
must
be
secured
before
any
domestic
alteration
however
trivial
may
be
considered
no
mortal
man
may
hope
to
remain
a
paragon
of
unselfishness
colonel
musgrave
joyed
in
the
society
of
women
but
he
classed
them
say
with
the
croquettes
adorned
with
pink
paper
frills
which
were
then
invariably
served
at
the
suppers
of
the
lichfield
german
club
as
acceptable
enough
upon
a
conscious
holiday
but
wholly
incongruous
with
the
slippered
ease
of
home
when
you
had
an
inclination
for
feminine
society
you
shaved
and
changed
your
clothes
and
thought
up
an
impromptu
or
so
against
emergency
and
went
forth
to
seek
it
that
was
natural
but
to
have
a
petticoated
young
person
infesting
your
house
hourly
was
as
preposterous
as
soda
at
breakfast
the
metaphor
set
him
off
at
a
tangent
he
wondered
if
this
patricia
person
could
not
tactfully
be
induced
to
take
her
bath
after
breakfast
as
agatha
did
after
he
had
his
why
confound
the
girl
he
was
not
responsible
for
there
being
only
one
bathroom
in
the
house
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
have
his
bath
and
be
at
the
library
by
nine
this
interloper
must
be
made
to
understand
as
much
the
colonel
reached
the
library
undecided
as
to
whether
miss
stapylton
had
better
breakfast
in
her
room
or
if
it
would
be
entirely
proper
for
her
to
come
to
the
table
in
one
of
those
fluffy
garments
such
as
agatha
affected
at
the
day
beginning
the
question
was
a
nice
one
it
was
not
as
though
servants
were
willing
to
be
bothered
with
carrying
trays
to
people
rooms
he
knew
what
agatha
had
to
say
upon
that
subject
it
was
not
as
though
he
were
the
chit
first
cousin
either
he
almost
wished
himself
in
the
decline
of
life
and
free
to
treat
the
girl
paternally
and
so
he
fretted
all
that
afternoon
then
too
he
reflected
that
it
would
be
very
awkward
if
agatha
should
be
unwell
while
this
patricia
person
was
in
the
house
agatha
in
her
normal
state
was
of
course
the
kindliest
and
cheeriest
gentlewoman
in
the
universe
but
any
physical
illness
appeared
to
transform
her
nature
disastrously
she
had
her
attacks
she
felt
badly
very
often
nowadays
poor
dear
and
how
was
a
patricia
person
to
be
expected
to
make
allowances
for
the
fact
that
at
such
times
poor
agatha
was
unavoidably
a
little
cross
and
pessimistic
v
yet
colonel
musgrave
strolled
into
his
garden
later
with
a
tolerable
affectation
of
unconcern
women
after
all
he
assured
himself
were
necessary
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
species
and
resolving
for
the
future
to
view
these
weakly
and
makeshifts
of
nature
with
larger
tolerance
he
cocked
his
hat
at
a
angle
and
strode
up
the
walk
whistling
jauntily
and
having
it
must
be
confessed
to
the
unprejudiced
observer
very
much
the
air
of
a
sheep
in
wolf
clothing
at
worst
he
was
reflecting
i
can
make
love
to
her
they
as
a
rule
take
kindlily
enough
to
that
and
in
the
exercise
of
hospitality
a
host
must
go
to
all
lengths
to
divert
his
guests
failure
is
not
permitted
then
she
came
to
him
she
came
to
him
across
the
trim
cool
lawn
leisurely
yet
with
a
resilient
tread
that
attested
the
vigor
of
her
slim
young
body
she
was
all
in
white
diaphanous
ethereal
quite
incredibly
incredible
but
as
she
passed
through
the
long
shadows
of
the
garden
from
the
heart
of
the
sunset
rudolph
musgrave
would
have
sworn
to
you
the
lacy
folds
and
furbelows
and
that
clothed
her
were
now
tinged
with
gold
and
now
as
a
hedge
or
screened
her
from
the
horizontal
rays
were
softened
into
multitudinous
graduations
of
grays
and
mauves
and
violets
failure
is
not
permitted
he
was
repeating
in
his
soul
you
cousin
rudolph
are
you
she
asked
how
perfectly
entrancing
you
see
until
i
always
thought
that
if
i
had
been
offered
the
choice
between
having
cousins
or
appendicitis
i
would
have
preferred
to
be
operated
on
and
rudolph
musgrave
noted
with
a
delicious
tingling
somewhere
about
his
heart
that
her
hair
was
really
like
the
reflection
of
a
sunset
in
rippling
waters
only
many
times
more
beautiful
of
course
and
that
her
mouth
was
an
inconsiderable
trifle
a
scrap
of
sanguine
curves
and
that
her
eyes
were
purple
glimpses
of
infinity
then
he
observed
that
his
own
mouth
was
giving
utterance
to
divers
irrelevant
and
foolish
sounds
which
eventually
resolved
themselves
into
the
statement
he
was
glad
to
see
her
and
immediately
afterward
the
banality
of
this
remark
brought
the
hot
blood
to
his
face
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
stung
him
and
teased
him
somewhere
in
the
background
of
his
mind
like
an
incessant
insect
glad
indeed
before
he
had
finished
shaking
hands
with
patricia
stapylton
it
was
all
over
with
the
poor
man
er
h
quoth
he
only
miss
stapylton
was
meditating
with
puckered
brow
it
would
be
unseemly
for
me
to
call
you
rudolph
you
impertinent
minx
cried
he
in
his
soul
i
should
rather
think
it
would
be
and
cousin
rudolph
sounds
exactly
like
a
little
man
with
eyeglasses
and
crows
feet
and
a
gentle
nature
i
rather
thought
you
were
going
to
be
like
that
and
i
regard
it
as
extremely
hospitable
of
you
not
to
be
you
are
more
like
like
what
now
miss
stapylton
put
her
head
to
one
side
and
considered
the
contents
of
her
vocabulary
you
are
like
a
viking
i
shall
call
you
olaf
she
announced
when
she
had
reached
a
decision
this
look
you
to
the
most
dignified
man
in
lichfield
a
person
who
had
never
borne
a
nickname
in
his
life
you
must
picture
for
yourself
how
the
colonel
stood
before
her
big
sturdy
and
blond
and
glared
down
at
her
and
assured
himself
that
he
was
very
indignant
like
timanthes
the
colonel
biographer
prefers
to
draw
a
veil
before
the
countenance
to
which
art
is
unable
to
do
justice
then
i
have
no
admiration
for
the
northmen
rudolph
musgrave
declared
stiffly
they
were
a
rude
and
barbarous
nation
proverbially
addicted
to
piracy
and
intemperance
my
goodness
gracious
miss
stapylton
observed
and
now
for
the
first
time
he
saw
the
teeth
that
were
like
grains
of
rice
upon
a
pink
rose
petal
also
he
saw
dimples
and
does
one
mean
all
that
by
a
viking
the
vikings
he
informed
her
and
his
library
manner
had
settled
upon
him
now
to
the
very
tips
of
his
fingers
were
pirates
the
word
is
of
icelandic
origin
from
the
name
applied
to
the
small
inlets
along
the
coast
in
which
they
concealed
their
galleys
i
may
mention
that
olaf
was
not
a
viking
but
a
norwegian
king
being
the
first
christian
monarch
to
reign
in
norway
dear
me
said
miss
stapylton
how
interesting
then
she
yawned
with
deliberate
cruelty
however
she
concluded
i
shall
call
you
olaf
just
the
same
er
h
said
the
colonel
and
this
stuttering
boor
he
reflected
was
colonel
rudolph
musgrave
confessedly
the
social
triumph
of
his
generation
this
imbecile
without
a
syllable
to
say
for
himself
without
a
solitary
adroit
word
within
tongue
reach
wherewith
to
annihilate
the
hussy
was
a
musgrave
of
matocton
and
she
did
to
her
he
was
olaf
from
that
day
forth
rudolph
musgrave
called
her
you
he
was
nettled
of
course
by
her
forwardness
olaf
indeed
yet
he
found
it
somehow
difficult
to
bear
this
fact
in
mind
continuously
for
while
it
is
true
our
heroes
and
heroines
in
fiction
no
longer
fall
in
love
at
first
sight
nature
you
must
remember
is
too
busily
employed
with
other
matters
to
have
much
time
to
profit
by
current
literature
then
too
she
is
not
especially
anxious
to
be
realistic
she
prefers
to
jog
along
in
the
old
rut
contentedly
turning
out
chromolithographic
sunrises
such
as
they
give
away
at
the
tea
stores
contentedly
staging
the
most
violent
and
improbable
melodramas
and
sturdy
old
philistine
that
she
is
she
even
now
permits
her
children
to
fall
in
love
in
the
most
primitive
fashion
she
is
not
particularly
interested
in
subtleties
and
soul
analyses
she
merely
chuckles
rather
complacently
when
a
pair
of
eyes
are
drawn
somehow
to
another
pair
of
eyes
and
an
indescribable
something
is
altered
somewhere
in
some
untellable
fashion
and
the
world
suddenly
becomes
the
most
delightful
place
of
residence
in
all
the
universe
indeed
it
is
her
favorite
miracle
this
for
at
work
of
this
sort
the
old
philistine
knows
that
she
is
an
adept
and
she
has
rejoiced
in
the
skill
of
her
hands
with
a
sober
workmanly
joy
since
cain
first
went
in
the
land
of
nod
so
colonel
rudolph
musgrave
without
understanding
what
had
happened
to
him
on
a
sudden
was
strangely
content
with
life
it
was
at
supper
dinner
in
lichfield
when
not
a
formal
entertainment
is
eaten
at
two
in
the
afternoon
that
he
fell
as
to
whether
her
eyes
after
all
could
be
fitly
described
as
purple
was
there
a
grayer
luminosity
about
them
than
he
had
at
first
suspected
was
the
cool
glow
of
them
in
a
word
rather
that
of
sunlight
falling
upon
a
wet
slate
roof
it
was
a
delicate
question
an
affair
of
nuances
of
almost
imperceptible
graduations
and
in
debating
a
matter
of
such
nicety
a
man
must
necessarily
lay
aside
all
petty
irritation
such
as
being
nettled
by
an
irrational
nickname
and
approach
the
question
with
unbiased
mind
he
did
and
when
at
last
he
had
come
warily
to
the
verge
of
decision
miss
musgrave
in
all
innocence
announced
that
they
would
excuse
him
if
he
wished
to
get
back
to
his
work
he
discovered
that
somehow
the
three
had
finished
supper
and
somehow
he
presently
discovered
himself
in
his
study
where
eight
had
found
him
every
evening
for
the
last
ten
years
when
he
was
not
about
his
social
diversions
an
old
custom
you
will
observe
is
not
lightly
broken
vi
subsequently
i
have
never
approved
of
these
international
marriages
said
colonel
musgrave
with
heat
it
stands
to
reason
she
is
simply
marrying
the
fellow
for
his
title
the
will
of
jeremiah
brown
dated
november
recorded
february
mentions
his
wife
eliza
brown
and
appoints
her
his
executrix
she
ca
possibly
care
for
him
this
then
was
the
second
wife
of
edward
osborne
of
henrico
who
marrying
him
june
died
before
january
but
they
are
all
flibbertigibbets
every
one
of
them
she
had
apparently
no
children
by
either
marriage
and
i
dare
say
she
is
no
better
than
the
rest
came
a
tap
on
the
door
followed
a
vision
of
soft
white
folds
and
furbelows
and
and
purple
eyes
and
a
pouting
mouth
i
am
become
like
a
pelican
in
the
wilderness
olaf
the
owner
of
these
vanities
complained
are
you
very
busy
cousin
agatha
is
about
her
housekeeping
and
i
have
read
the
afternoon
paper
all
through
even
the
list
of
undelivered
letters
and
the
woman
page
and
i
just
want
to
see
the
gilbert
stuart
picture
she
concluded
exercising
one
is
afraid
a
certain
economy
in
regard
to
the
truth
this
was
a
little
too
much
if
a
man
are
not
to
be
respected
if
his
privacy
is
to
be
thus
invaded
on
the
flimsiest
of
pretexts
why
then
one
may
very
reasonably
look
for
chaos
to
come
again
this
rudolph
musgrave
decided
was
a
case
demanding
firm
and
instant
action
here
was
a
young
person
who
needed
taking
down
a
peg
or
two
and
that
at
once
but
he
made
the
mistake
of
looking
at
her
first
and
after
that
he
lied
glibly
good
lord
no
i
am
not
in
the
least
busy
now
in
fact
i
was
just
about
to
look
you
two
up
i
was
rather
afraid
of
disturbing
you
she
hesitated
and
a
lucent
mischief
woke
in
her
eyes
you
are
so
patriarchal
olaf
she
lamented
i
felt
like
a
lion
venturing
into
a
den
of
daniels
but
if
you
cross
your
heart
you
are
really
busy
why
then
you
can
show
me
the
stuart
olaf
it
is
widely
conceded
that
gilbert
stuart
never
in
his
after
work
surpassed
the
painting
which
hung
then
in
rudolph
musgrave
study
the
portrait
of
the
young
gerald
musgrave
afterward
the
friend
of
jefferson
and
henry
and
still
later
the
author
of
divers
bulky
tomes
pertaining
for
the
most
part
to
ethnology
the
boy
smiles
at
you
from
the
canvas
smiles
ambiguously
smiles
with
a
woman
mouth
set
above
a
resolute
chin
however
and
with
a
sort
of
humorous
sadness
in
his
eyes
these
latter
are
of
a
dark
shade
of
blue
purple
if
you
will
and
his
hair
is
tinged
with
red
why
he
took
after
me
said
miss
stapylton
how
thoughtful
of
him
olaf
and
rudolph
musgrave
saw
the
undeniable
resemblance
it
gave
him
a
queer
sort
of
shock
too
as
he
comprehended
for
the
first
time
that
the
faint
blue
vein
on
that
lifted
arm
held
musgrave
blood
the
same
blood
which
at
this
thought
quickened
for
any
person
guided
by
appearances
rudolph
musgrave
considered
would
have
surmised
that
the
vein
in
question
contained
celestial
ichor
or
some
yet
diviner
fluid
it
is
true
he
conceded
that
there
is
a
certain
likeness
and
he
is
a
very
beautiful
boy
said
miss
stapylton
demurely
thank
you
olaf
i
begin
to
think
you
are
a
dangerous
flatterer
but
he
is
only
a
boy
olaf
and
i
had
always
thought
of
gerald
musgrave
as
a
learned
person
with
a
fringe
of
whiskers
all
around
his
face
like
a
centerpiece
you
know
the
colonel
smiled
this
portrait
was
painted
early
in
life
our
kinsman
was
at
that
time
i
believe
a
person
of
rather
frivolous
tendencies
yet
he
was
not
quite
thirty
when
he
first
established
his
reputation
by
his
monograph
upon
evolution
of
and
afterwards
just
prior
to
his
first
meeting
with
goethe
you
will
remember
oh
yes
miss
stapylton
assented
hastily
i
remember
perfectly
i
know
all
about
him
thank
you
and
it
was
that
beautiful
boy
olaf
that
cherub
who
developed
into
a
musty
old
man
who
wrote
musty
old
books
and
lived
a
musty
dusty
life
all
by
himself
and
never
married
or
had
any
fun
at
all
how
olaf
she
cried
with
a
queer
shrug
of
distaste
i
fail
said
colonel
musgrave
to
perceive
anything
ah
horrid
in
a
life
devoted
to
the
study
of
anthropology
his
reputation
when
he
died
was
international
but
he
never
had
any
fun
you
and
oh
olaf
olaf
that
boy
could
have
had
so
much
fun
the
world
held
so
much
for
him
why
fortune
is
only
a
woman
you
know
and
what
woman
could
have
refused
him
anything
if
he
had
smiled
at
her
like
that
when
he
asked
for
it
miss
stapylton
gazed
up
at
the
portrait
for
a
long
time
now
her
hands
clasped
under
her
chin
her
face
was
gently
reproachful
oh
boy
dear
boy
dear
she
said
with
a
forlorn
little
quaver
in
her
voice
how
you
be
foolish
you
know
there
was
something
better
in
the
world
than
grubbing
after
musty
old
tribes
and
customs
and
oh
precious
child
how
could
you
gerald
musgrave
smiled
back
at
her
ambiguously
and
rudolph
musgrave
laughed
i
perceive
said
he
you
are
a
follower
of
epicurus
for
my
part
i
must
have
fetched
my
ideals
from
the
tub
of
the
stoic
i
can
conceive
of
no
nobler
life
than
one
devoted
to
furthering
the
cause
of
science
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
wan
smile
a
barren
life
she
said
ah
yes
his
was
a
wasted
life
his
books
are
all
now
and
nobody
reads
them
and
it
is
just
as
if
he
had
never
been
a
barren
life
olaf
and
that
beautiful
boy
might
have
had
so
much
fun
life
is
queer
is
it
olaf
again
he
laughed
the
criticism
he
suggested
is
not
altogether
original
and
science
no
less
than
war
must
have
her
unsung
heroes
you
must
remember
he
continued
more
seriously
that
any
great
work
must
have
as
its
foundation
the
achievements
of
unknown
men
i
fancy
that
cheops
did
not
lay
every
brick
in
his
pyramid
with
his
own
hand
and
i
dare
say
nebuchadnezzar
employed
a
few
helpers
when
he
was
laying
out
his
hanging
gardens
but
time
can
not
chronicle
these
lesser
men
their
sole
reward
must
be
the
knowledge
that
they
have
aided
somewhat
in
the
unending
work
of
the
world
her
face
had
altered
into
a
pink
and
white
penitence
which
was
flavored
with
awe
i
i
forgot
she
murmured
contritely
i
forgot
you
were
like
him
about
your
genealogies
you
know
oh
olaf
i
very
silly
of
course
it
is
tremendously
fine
and
and
nice
i
dare
say
if
you
like
it
to
devote
your
life
to
learning
as
you
and
he
have
done
i
forgot
olaf
still
i
am
sorry
somehow
for
that
beautiful
boy
she
ended
with
a
disconsolate
glance
at
the
portrait
vii
long
after
miss
stapylton
had
left
him
the
colonel
sat
alone
in
his
study
idle
now
and
musing
vaguely
there
were
no
more
addenda
concerning
the
descendants
of
captain
thomas
osborne
that
night
at
last
the
colonel
rose
and
threw
open
a
window
and
stood
looking
into
the
moonlit
garden
the
world
bathed
in
a
mist
of
blue
and
silver
there
was
a
breeze
that
brought
him
sweet
warm
odors
from
the
garden
together
with
a
blurred
shrilling
of
crickets
and
the
conspiratorial
conference
of
young
leaves
of
course
it
is
tremendously
fine
and
and
nice
if
you
like
it
he
said
with
a
faint
chuckle
i
wonder
now
if
i
do
like
it
he
was
strangely
moved
he
seemed
somehow
to
survey
rudolph
musgrave
and
all
his
doings
with
complete
and
unconcerned
aloofness
the
life
seen
in
its
true
proportions
dwindled
into
the
merest
flicker
of
a
match
he
had
such
a
little
while
to
live
this
rudolph
musgrave
and
he
spent
the
serious
hours
of
this
brief
time
writing
notes
and
charts
and
pamphlets
that
perhaps
some
hundred
men
in
all
the
universe
might
care
to
read
pamphlets
no
better
and
no
more
accurate
than
hundreds
of
other
men
were
writing
at
that
very
moment
no
the
capacity
for
originative
and
enduring
work
was
not
in
him
and
this
incessant
compilation
of
dreary
footnotes
this
incessant
rummaging
among
the
bones
of
the
dead
did
it
after
all
mean
more
to
this
rudolph
musgrave
than
one
full
vivid
hour
of
life
in
that
militant
world
yonder
where
men
fought
for
other
and
more
tangible
prizes
than
the
mention
of
one
name
in
a
genealogical
journal
he
could
not
have
told
you
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
a
thorough
digest
of
the
wills
and
orders
of
the
orphans
court
of
any
county
must
always
rank
as
a
useful
and
creditable
performance
but
from
without
the
sounds
and
odors
of
spring
were
calling
to
him
luring
him
wringing
his
very
heart
bidding
him
come
forth
into
the
open
and
crack
a
jest
or
two
before
he
died
and
stare
at
the
girls
a
little
before
the
match
had
flickered
out
at
this
time
he
heard
a
moaning
noise
the
colonel
gave
a
shrug
sighed
and
ascended
to
his
sister
bedroom
he
knew
that
agatha
must
be
ill
and
that
there
is
no
more
efficient
quietus
to
wildish
meditations
than
the
heating
of
bottles
and
the
administration
of
hypnotics
he
had
long
ago
discovered
part
two
renascence
as
one
imprisoned
that
hath
lain
alone
and
dreamed
of
sunlight
where
no
vagrant
gleam
of
sunlight
pierces
being
freed
must
deem
this
too
but
dreaming
and
must
dread
the
sun
whose
glory
dazzles
even
as
am
i
whose
longing
was
but
now
supreme
for
this
high
hour
and
now
it
strikes
esteem
i
do
but
dream
long
goals
are
won
phyllis
i
am
not
worthy
of
thy
love
i
pray
thee
let
no
kindly
word
be
said
of
me
at
all
for
in
the
train
thereof
whenas
lips
end
speech
and
wait
mine
when
i
will
to
move
such
joy
awakens
that
i
grow
afraid
thomas
rowland
of
i
they
passed
with
incredible
celerity
those
next
ten
days
those
strange
delicious
days
to
rudolph
musgrave
it
seemed
afterward
that
he
had
dreamed
them
away
in
some
vague
lotus
land
in
a
delectable
country
where
he
remembered
there
were
always
purple
eyes
that
mocked
you
and
red
lips
that
coaxed
you
now
and
now
cast
gibes
at
you
you
felt
for
the
most
part
of
your
stay
in
this
country
flushed
and
hot
and
uncomfortable
and
unbelievably
awkward
and
you
were
mercilessly
bedeviled
there
but
not
for
all
the
accumulated
wealth
of
samarkand
and
ind
and
ophir
would
you
have
had
it
otherwise
ah
no
not
otherwise
in
the
least
trifle
for
now
uplifted
to
a
rosy
zone
of
acquiescence
you
partook
incuriously
at
table
of
nectar
and
ambrosia
and
noted
abroad
without
any
surprise
that
you
trod
upon
a
more
verdant
grass
than
usual
and
that
someone
had
polished
up
the
sun
a
bit
and
in
fine
you
snatched
a
fearful
joy
from
the
performance
of
the
most
trivial
functions
of
life
yet
always
he
remembered
that
it
could
not
last
always
he
remembered
that
in
the
autumn
patricia
was
to
marry
lord
pevensey
she
sometimes
gave
him
letters
to
mail
which
were
addressed
to
that
nobleman
he
wondered
savagely
what
was
in
them
he
posted
them
with
a
vicious
shove
and
for
the
time
they
caused
him
acute
twinges
of
misery
but
not
for
long
no
for
in
sober
earnest
if
some
fantastic
sequence
of
events
had
made
his
one
chance
of
winning
patricia
stapylton
dependent
on
his
spending
a
miserable
in
her
company
rudolph
musgrave
could
not
have
done
it
as
for
miss
stapylton
she
appeared
to
delight
in
the
cloistered
life
of
lichfield
the
quaint
and
beautiful
old
town
fell
short
in
nothing
of
her
expectations
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
previously
read
john
charteris
tales
of
lichfield
those
effusions
which
if
the
is
to
be
trusted
have
builded
by
the
strength
and
witchery
of
record
and
rhyme
romance
and
poem
a
temple
in
lichfield
honor
exquisite
luminous
and
enduring
for
all
the
world
to
see
miss
stapylton
appeared
to
delight
in
the
cloistered
life
of
lichfield
that
town
which
was
once
as
the
outside
world
has
now
the
center
of
america
wealth
politics
and
culture
the
town
to
which
europeans
compiling
impressions
of
america
devoted
one
of
their
longest
chapters
in
the
heyday
of
elijah
pogram
and
jefferson
brick
but
the
war
between
the
states
has
changed
all
that
and
lichfield
endures
only
as
a
pleasant
backwater
very
pleasant
too
it
was
in
the
days
of
patricia
advent
there
were
strikingly
few
young
men
about
to
be
sure
most
of
them
on
reaching
maturity
had
settled
in
more
bustling
regions
but
many
maidens
remained
whom
memory
delights
to
catalogue
tall
brilliant
lizzie
allardyce
the
lovely
and
cattish
marian
winwood
to
whom
felix
kennaston
wrote
those
wonderful
which
she
published
when
he
married
kathleen
saumarez
the
rich
baugh
heiresses
from
georgia
the
pride
twins
and
mattie
ferneyhaugh
whom
even
rival
beauties
loved
they
say
and
other
damsels
by
the
score
all
in
due
time
to
be
wooed
and
won
and
then
to
pass
out
of
the
old
town
life
among
the
men
of
rudolph
musgrave
generation
those
gallant
oldsters
who
were
born
and
bred
and
meant
to
die
in
lichfield
patricia
did
not
lack
for
admirers
tom
may
was
one
of
them
of
course
rarely
a
pretty
face
escaped
the
tribute
of
at
least
one
proposal
from
tom
may
then
there
was
roderick
taunton
he
with
the
leonine
mane
who
spared
her
none
of
his
forensic
eloquence
but
found
patricia
less
tractable
than
the
most
stubborn
of
juries
bluff
walter
thurman
too
who
was
said
to
know
more
of
dickens
whist
and
criminal
law
than
any
other
man
living
came
to
worship
at
her
shrine
as
likewise
did
huge
ashby
bland
famed
for
that
cavalry
charge
which
tell
you
that
he
led
and
at
which
he
actually
was
not
present
for
reasons
all
lichfield
knew
and
chuckled
over
and
courtney
thorpe
and
charles
maupin
doctors
of
the
flesh
and
the
spirit
severally
were
others
among
the
rivals
who
gathered
about
patricia
at
decorous
festivals
when
candles
lighted
the
butler
and
his
underlings
came
with
trays
of
delectable
things
to
eat
and
the
nests
of
tables
were
set
out
and
pleasant
chatter
abounded
and
among
patricia
attendants
colonel
musgrave
it
is
needless
to
relate
was
preëminently
pertinacious
the
two
found
a
deal
to
talk
about
somehow
though
it
is
doubtful
if
many
of
their
comments
were
of
sufficient
importance
or
novelty
to
merit
record
then
also
he
often
read
aloud
to
her
from
lovely
books
for
the
colonel
read
admirably
and
did
not
scruple
to
give
emotional
passages
their
value
published
the
preceding
spring
in
book
form
was
one
of
these
books
for
all
this
was
at
a
very
remote
period
and
the
was
another
for
that
poem
was
as
yet
unhackneyed
and
hardly
wellknown
enough
to
be
parodied
in
those
happy
days
once
he
read
to
her
that
wonderful
sad
tale
of
hans
christian
which
treats
of
the
china
and
the
shepherdess
who
eloped
from
their
bedizened
tiny
and
were
frightened
by
the
vastness
of
the
world
outside
and
crept
ignominiously
back
to
their
fit
home
and
so
the
colonel
ended
the
little
china
people
remained
together
and
were
thankful
for
the
rivet
in
grandfather
neck
and
continued
to
love
each
other
until
they
were
broken
to
pieces
it
was
really
a
very
lucky
thing
patricia
estimated
that
the
grandfather
had
a
rivet
in
his
neck
and
could
nod
to
the
person
to
take
the
shepherdess
away
into
his
cupboard
i
do
doubt
the
little
china
people
were
glad
of
it
but
after
climbing
so
far
and
seeing
the
stars
i
think
they
ought
to
have
had
more
to
be
glad
for
her
voice
was
quaintly
wistful
i
will
let
you
into
a
secret
er
patricia
that
rivet
was
made
out
of
the
strongest
material
in
the
whole
universe
and
the
old
grandfather
was
glad
at
bottom
he
had
it
in
his
neck
so
that
he
could
nod
and
separate
the
shepherdess
from
the
yes
i
guess
he
had
been
rather
a
rip
among
the
in
his
day
and
sympathized
with
them
no
it
was
just
that
you
see
these
little
china
people
had
forsaken
their
orderly
comfortable
world
on
the
parlor
table
to
climb
very
high
it
was
a
brave
thing
to
do
even
though
they
faltered
and
came
back
after
a
while
it
is
what
we
all
want
to
do
patricia
to
climb
toward
the
stars
even
those
of
us
who
are
too
lazy
or
too
cowardly
to
attempt
it
and
when
others
try
it
we
are
envious
and
a
little
uncomfortable
and
we
probably
scoff
but
we
ca
help
admiring
and
there
is
a
rivet
in
the
neck
of
all
of
us
which
prevents
us
from
interfering
oh
yes
we
little
china
people
have
a
variety
of
rivets
thank
god
to
prevent
too
frequent
nodding
and
too
cowardly
a
compromise
with
baseness
rivets
that
are
a
part
of
us
and
force
us
into
flashes
of
upright
living
almost
in
spite
of
ourselves
when
duty
and
inclination
grapple
there
is
always
the
thing
one
can
not
do
for
the
reason
that
one
is
constituted
as
one
is
that
i
take
it
is
the
real
rivet
in
grandfather
neck
and
everybody
else
he
spoke
disjointedly
vaguely
but
the
girl
nodded
i
think
i
understand
olaf
only
it
is
a
rivet
to
mix
metaphors
and
keeps
us
stiffnecked
against
all
sorts
of
calls
no
i
am
not
sure
that
the
thing
one
can
not
do
because
one
is
what
one
is
proves
to
be
always
a
cause
for
international
jubilations
and
fireworks
on
the
lawn
ii
thus
lichfield
as
to
its
staid
trousered
citizenry
fell
prostrate
at
miss
stapylton
feet
and
as
to
the
remainder
of
its
adults
vociferously
failed
to
see
anything
in
the
least
remarkable
in
her
appearance
and
avidly
took
and
compared
notes
as
to
her
personal
apparel
you
have
brought
asmodeus
into
lichfield
colonel
musgrave
one
day
rebuked
miss
stapylton
as
they
sat
in
the
garden
the
demon
of
pride
and
dress
is
rampant
everywhere
er
patricia
even
agatha
does
her
hair
differently
now
and
in
church
last
sunday
i
counted
no
less
than
seven
duplicates
of
that
blue
hat
of
yours
miss
stapylton
was
moved
to
mirth
fancy
your
noticing
a
thing
like
that
said
she
i
did
know
you
were
even
aware
i
had
a
blue
hat
i
am
no
judge
he
conceded
gravely
of
such
fripperies
i
pretend
to
be
but
on
the
other
hand
i
must
plead
guilty
to
deriving
considerable
harmless
amusement
from
your
efforts
to
dress
as
an
example
and
an
irritant
to
all
lichfield
you
would
have
me
a
dowd
olaf
said
she
demurely
i
have
to
be
neat
and
tidy
you
know
you
would
have
me
going
about
in
a
continuous
state
of
unbuttonedness
and
black
bombazine
like
rabbet
would
you
rudolph
musgrave
debated
as
to
this
i
dare
say
he
at
last
conceded
cautiously
that
to
the
casual
eye
your
appearance
is
somewhat
er
more
pleasing
than
that
of
our
rector
wife
but
on
the
other
hand
olaf
i
am
embarrassed
by
such
fulsome
eulogy
rabbet
is
a
day
under
and
you
consider
me
than
she
is
he
inspected
her
critically
and
was
confirmed
in
his
opinion
olaf
coaxingly
do
you
really
think
i
am
as
ugly
as
that
pouf
said
the
colonel
airily
i
dare
say
you
are
well
enough
olaf
and
this
was
even
more
cajoling
do
you
know
you
never
told
me
what
sort
of
a
woman
you
most
admire
i
do
admire
any
of
them
said
colonel
musgrave
stoutly
they
are
too
vain
and
frivolous
especially
the
ones
he
added
unkindlily
cousin
agatha
has
told
me
all
about
your
multifarious
affairs
of
course
she
depicts
you
as
a
sort
of
cardiacal
buccaneer
and
visibly
gloats
over
the
tale
of
your
enormities
she
is
perfectly
dear
about
it
but
have
you
never
for
any
woman
olaf
precarious
ground
this
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
now
and
hers
for
doubtless
sufficient
reasons
were
curiously
intent
upon
anything
in
the
universe
rather
than
rudolph
musgrave
yes
said
he
with
a
little
intake
of
the
breath
yes
i
cared
once
and
she
cared
asked
miss
stapylton
she
happened
even
now
not
to
be
looking
at
him
she
rudolph
musgrave
cried
in
real
surprise
why
god
bless
my
soul
of
course
she
did
she
did
know
anything
about
it
you
never
told
her
olaf
and
this
was
reproachful
then
patricia
said
well
and
did
she
go
down
in
the
cellar
and
get
the
or
was
she
satisfied
just
to
throw
the
at
you
and
colonel
musgrave
laughed
aloud
ah
said
he
it
would
have
been
a
brave
jest
if
i
had
told
her
would
it
she
was
young
you
see
and
wealthy
and
ah
well
i
deceive
you
by
exaggerating
her
personal
attractions
i
will
serve
up
to
you
no
praises
of
her
sauced
with
lies
and
i
scorn
to
fall
back
on
the
of
the
poets
all
their
silly
metaphors
and
similes
and
suchlike
nonsense
i
wo
tell
you
that
her
complexion
reminded
me
of
roses
swimming
in
milk
for
it
did
nothing
of
the
sort
nor
am
i
going
to
insist
that
her
eyes
had
a
fire
like
that
of
stars
or
proclaim
that
cupid
was
in
the
habit
of
lighting
his
torch
from
them
i
do
think
he
was
i
would
like
to
have
caught
the
brat
taking
any
such
liberties
with
those
innocent
humorous
unfathomable
eyes
of
hers
and
they
did
remind
me
of
violets
either
he
pursued
belligerently
nor
did
her
mouth
look
to
me
in
the
least
like
a
rosebud
nor
did
i
have
the
slightest
difficulty
in
distinguishing
between
her
hands
and
lilies
i
consider
these
hyperbolical
figures
of
speech
to
be
idiotic
ah
no
cried
colonel
musgrave
warming
to
his
subject
and
regarding
it
too
very
intently
ah
no
a
face
that
could
be
patched
together
at
the
nearest
florist
would
not
haunt
a
man
dreams
as
hers
does
i
have
any
need
for
praises
sauced
with
lies
i
spurn
hyperbole
i
scorn
exaggeration
i
merely
state
calmly
and
judicially
that
she
was
god
masterpiece
the
most
beautiful
and
adorable
and
indescribable
creature
that
he
ever
made
she
smiled
at
this
you
should
have
told
her
olaf
said
miss
stapylton
you
should
have
told
her
that
you
cared
he
gave
a
gesture
of
dissent
she
had
everything
he
pointed
out
everything
the
world
could
afford
her
and
doubtless
she
would
have
been
very
glad
to
give
it
all
up
for
me
would
she
for
me
who
have
youth
or
wealth
or
fame
or
anything
ah
i
dare
say
she
would
have
been
delighted
to
give
up
the
world
she
knew
and
loved
the
world
that
loved
her
for
the
privilege
of
helping
me
digest
old
county
records
and
rudolph
musgrave
laughed
again
though
not
mirthfully
but
the
girl
was
staring
at
him
with
a
vague
trouble
in
her
eyes
you
should
have
told
her
olaf
she
repeated
and
at
this
point
he
noted
that
the
in
her
cheeks
began
to
widen
slowly
until
at
last
it
had
burned
back
to
the
little
pink
ears
and
had
merged
into
the
coppery
glory
of
her
hair
and
had
made
her
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
which
a
minute
ago
it
manifestly
was
not
more
beautiful
and
adorable
and
indescribable
than
ever
before
ah
yes
he
scoffed
lichfield
would
have
made
a
fitting
home
for
her
she
would
have
been
very
happy
here
shut
off
from
the
world
with
us
with
us
whose
forefathers
have
married
and
intermarried
with
one
another
until
the
stock
is
worthless
and
impotent
for
any
further
achievement
for
here
you
know
we
have
the
best
blood
in
america
and
for
utilitarian
purposes
that
means
the
worst
blood
ah
we
may
prate
of
our
superiority
to
the
rest
of
the
world
and
god
knows
we
do
but
at
bottom
we
are
worthless
we
are
worn
out
i
tell
you
we
are
effete
and
stunted
in
brain
and
and
the
very
desire
of
life
is
gone
out
of
us
we
are
contented
simply
to
exist
in
lichfield
and
she
he
paused
and
a
new
fierce
light
came
into
his
eyes
she
was
so
beautiful
he
said
between
clenched
teeth
you
are
just
like
the
rest
of
them
olaf
she
lamented
with
a
hint
of
real
sadness
you
imagine
you
are
in
love
with
a
girl
because
you
happen
to
like
the
color
of
her
eyes
or
because
there
is
a
curve
about
her
lips
that
appeals
to
you
that
is
love
olaf
as
we
women
understand
it
ah
no
a
girl
love
for
a
man
does
depend
altogether
upon
his
fitness
to
be
used
as
an
advertisement
for
clothing
you
fancy
you
know
what
you
are
talking
about
said
rudolph
musgrave
but
you
do
you
do
realize
you
see
how
beautiful
she
was
and
this
time
he
nearly
tripped
upon
the
tense
for
her
hand
was
on
his
arm
and
in
consequence
a
series
of
warm
delicious
little
shivers
was
running
about
his
body
in
a
fashion
highly
favorable
to
extreme
perturbation
of
mind
you
should
have
told
her
olaf
she
said
wistfully
oh
olaf
olaf
why
did
you
tell
her
she
did
not
know
of
course
how
she
was
tempting
him
she
did
not
know
of
course
how
her
least
touch
seemed
to
waken
every
pulse
in
his
body
to
an
aching
throb
and
set
hope
and
fear
in
his
breast
obviously
she
did
not
know
and
it
angered
him
that
she
did
not
she
would
have
laughed
at
me
he
said
with
a
snarl
how
she
would
have
laughed
she
would
have
laughed
olaf
and
indeed
she
did
not
look
as
if
she
would
but
much
you
know
of
her
said
rudolph
musgrave
morosely
she
was
just
like
the
rest
of
them
i
tell
you
she
knew
how
to
stare
a
man
out
of
countenance
with
big
purple
eyes
that
were
like
violets
with
the
dew
on
them
and
keep
her
paltry
baby
face
all
pensive
and
sober
till
the
poor
devil
went
stark
staring
mad
and
would
have
pawned
his
very
soul
to
tell
her
that
he
loved
her
she
knew
she
did
it
on
purpose
she
would
look
pensive
just
to
make
an
ass
of
you
she
and
here
the
colonel
set
his
teeth
for
a
moment
and
resolutely
drew
back
from
the
abyss
she
would
not
have
cared
for
me
he
said
with
a
shrug
i
was
not
exactly
the
sort
of
fool
she
cared
for
what
she
really
cared
for
was
a
young
fool
who
could
dance
with
her
in
this
silly
gliding
style
and
send
her
flowers
and
and
make
love
to
her
glibly
and
a
petticoated
fool
who
would
envy
her
fine
feathers
and
at
last
a
knavish
fool
who
would
barter
his
title
for
her
money
she
preferred
fools
you
see
but
she
would
never
have
cared
for
a
penniless
fool
like
me
and
so
he
ended
with
a
vicious
outburst
of
mendacity
i
never
told
her
and
she
married
a
title
and
lived
unhappily
in
gilded
splendor
ever
afterwards
you
should
have
told
her
olaf
miss
stapylton
persisted
and
then
she
asked
in
a
voice
that
came
very
near
being
inaudible
is
it
too
late
to
tell
her
now
olaf
the
stupid
man
opened
his
lips
a
little
and
stood
staring
at
her
with
hungry
eyes
wondering
if
it
were
really
possible
that
she
did
not
hear
the
pounding
of
his
heart
and
then
his
teeth
clicked
and
he
gave
a
despondent
gesture
yes
he
said
wearily
it
is
too
late
now
thereupon
miss
stapylton
tossed
her
head
oh
very
well
said
she
only
for
my
part
i
think
you
acted
very
foolishly
and
i
do
see
that
you
have
the
least
right
to
complain
i
quite
fail
to
see
how
you
could
have
expected
her
to
marry
you
or
in
fact
how
you
can
expect
any
woman
to
marry
you
if
you
wo
at
least
go
to
the
trouble
of
asking
her
to
do
so
then
miss
stapylton
went
into
the
house
and
slammed
the
door
after
her
iii
nor
was
that
the
worst
of
it
for
when
rudolph
musgrave
followed
her
as
he
presently
did
in
a
state
of
considerable
amaze
his
sister
informed
him
that
miss
stapylton
had
retired
to
her
room
with
an
unaccountable
headache
and
there
she
remained
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
it
was
an
unusually
long
evening
yet
somehow
in
spite
of
its
notable
length
affording
as
it
did
an
excellent
opportunity
for
undisturbed
work
colonel
musgrave
found
with
a
pricking
conscience
that
he
made
astonishingly
slight
progress
in
an
exhaustive
monograph
upon
the
fragmentary
orderly
book
of
an
obscure
captain
in
a
regiment
which
if
it
had
not
actually
served
in
the
revolution
had
at
least
been
demonstrably
granted
money
for
services
and
so
entitled
hundreds
of
aspirants
to
become
the
sons
or
daughters
of
various
international
disagreements
nor
did
he
see
her
at
breakfast
nor
at
dinner
iv
a
curious
little
heartache
accompanied
colonel
musgrave
on
his
way
home
that
afternoon
he
had
not
seen
patricia
stapylton
for
hours
and
he
was
just
beginning
to
comprehend
what
life
would
be
like
without
her
he
did
not
find
the
prospect
exhilarating
then
as
he
came
up
the
orderly
graveled
walk
he
heard
issuing
from
the
little
a
loud
voice
it
was
a
voice
and
its
tones
were
angry
no
no
the
man
was
saying
i
agree
to
no
such
nonsense
i
tell
you
what
do
you
think
i
am
i
think
you
are
a
miss
stapylton
said
crisply
and
a
and
a
sot
and
a
travesty
and
a
whole
heap
of
other
things
i
have
as
yet
had
time
to
look
up
in
the
dictionary
and
i
think
i
think
you
call
yourself
an
english
gentleman
well
all
i
have
to
say
is
god
pity
england
if
her
gentlemen
are
of
your
stamp
there
is
a
costermonger
in
all
whitechapel
who
would
dare
talk
to
me
as
you
done
i
would
like
to
snatch
you
i
would
like
to
kill
you
and
do
you
think
now
if
you
were
the
very
last
man
left
in
all
the
that
i
would
no
do
you
try
to
answer
me
for
i
do
wish
to
hear
a
single
word
you
have
to
say
oh
oh
how
you
well
i
had
provocation
enough
the
man
voice
retorted
sullenly
perhaps
i
have
cut
up
a
bit
rough
patricia
but
then
you
been
talkin
like
a
fool
you
know
but
what
the
odds
let
kiss
and
make
up
old
girl
do
touch
me
she
panted
ah
do
you
you
little
devil
you
infernal
little
vixen
you
jilt
me
will
you
let
me
go
the
girl
cried
sharply
rudolph
musgrave
went
into
the
the
man
colonel
musgrave
found
there
was
big
and
with
traces
of
puffiness
about
his
face
he
had
hair
and
pale
blue
eyes
one
of
his
arms
was
about
miss
stapylton
but
he
released
her
now
and
blinked
at
rudolph
musgrave
and
who
are
you
pray
he
demanded
querulously
what
do
you
want
anyhow
what
do
you
mean
by
sneakin
in
here
and
tappin
on
a
shoulder
like
a
damn
woodpecker
by
jove
i
do
know
you
there
was
in
colonel
musgrave
voice
a
curious
tremor
when
he
spoke
but
to
the
eye
he
was
unruffled
even
faintly
amused
i
am
the
owner
of
this
garden
he
enunciated
with
leisurely
distinctness
and
it
is
not
my
custom
to
permit
gentlewomen
to
be
insulted
in
it
so
i
am
afraid
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
it
now
see
here
the
man
blustered
weakly
we
do
want
any
heroics
you
know
see
here
you
her
cousin
ai
you
by
god
i
leave
it
to
you
you
know
she
treated
me
badly
do
you
understand
she
a
jilt
you
know
she
playin
fast
and
loose
he
never
got
any
further
for
at
this
point
rudolph
musgrave
took
him
by
the
and
him
through
the
garden
shaking
him
occasionally
with
a
quiet
emphasis
the
colonel
was
angry
and
it
was
a
matter
of
utter
indifference
to
him
that
they
were
trampling
over
and
leaving
havoc
in
their
rear
but
when
they
had
reached
the
he
paused
and
opened
it
and
then
shoved
his
companion
into
an
open
field
where
a
number
of
cows
fresh
from
the
evening
milking
regarded
them
with
incurious
eyes
it
was
very
quiet
here
save
for
the
occasional
jangle
of
the
and
the
fifing
of
frogs
in
the
marsh
below
it
would
have
been
impossible
of
course
said
colonel
musgrave
for
me
to
have
offered
you
any
personal
violence
as
long
as
you
were
in
a
manner
a
guest
of
mine
this
field
however
is
the
property
of
judge
willoughby
and
here
i
feel
at
liberty
to
thrash
you
then
he
thrashed
the
man
who
had
annoyed
patricia
stapylton
that
thrashing
was
in
its
way
a
masterpiece
there
was
a
certain
conscientiousness
about
it
a
certain
thoroughness
of
execution
a
certain
plodding
and
painstaking
carefulness
in
a
word
such
as
is
possible
only
to
those
who
have
spent
years
in
guiding
tourists
among
the
antiquities
of
the
lichfield
historical
association
you
ought
to
exercise
more
rudolph
musgrave
admonished
his
victim
when
he
had
ended
you
are
entirely
too
flabby
now
you
know
that
path
yonder
will
take
you
to
the
hotel
where
i
imagine
you
are
staying
there
is
a
train
leaving
lichfield
at
and
if
i
were
you
i
would
be
very
careful
not
to
miss
that
train
i
am
sorry
to
have
been
compelled
to
thrash
you
but
i
must
admit
i
have
enjoyed
it
exceedingly
then
he
went
back
into
the
garden
v
in
the
shadow
of
a
white
colonel
musgrave
paused
with
an
awed
face
good
lord
said
he
aghast
at
the
notion
what
would
agatha
say
if
she
knew
i
had
been
fighting
like
a
drunken
or
rather
what
would
she
refrain
from
saying
only
she
would
believe
it
of
me
and
for
the
matter
of
that
rudolph
musgrave
continued
after
a
moment
reflection
i
would
have
believed
it
of
myself
a
week
ago
i
think
i
am
changing
somehow
a
week
ago
i
would
have
fetched
in
the
police
and
sworn
out
a
warrant
and
if
the
weather
had
been
as
damp
as
it
is
i
would
have
waited
to
put
on
my
rubbers
before
i
would
have
done
that
much
vi
he
found
her
still
in
the
expectant
of
him
it
seemed
her
lips
parted
her
eyes
glowing
rudolph
musgrave
looking
down
into
twin
vivid
depths
for
a
found
time
to
rejoice
that
he
had
refused
to
liken
them
to
stars
stars
forsooth
and
pray
what
paltry
sun
what
irresponsible
comet
what
pallid
clinkered
satellite
might
boast
a
purple
splendor
such
as
this
for
all
asterial
scintillations
at
best
had
but
a
glitter
whereas
the
glow
of
eyes
was
a
matter
worthy
of
really
serious
attention
what
have
you
done
with
him
olaf
the
girl
breathed
quickly
i
reasoned
with
him
said
colonel
musgrave
oh
i
found
him
quite
amenable
to
logic
he
is
leaving
lichfield
this
evening
i
think
thereupon
miss
stapylton
began
to
laugh
yes
said
she
you
must
have
remonstrated
very
feelingly
your
tie
all
crooked
olaf
dear
and
your
hair
all
rumpled
and
there
dust
all
over
your
coat
you
would
disgrace
a
oh
i
glad
you
reasoned
that
way
it
dignified
but
it
was
dear
of
you
olaf
pevensey
a
beast
he
caught
his
breath
at
this
pevensey
he
stammered
the
earl
of
pevensey
the
man
you
are
going
to
marry
dear
me
no
miss
stapylton
answered
with
utmost
unconcern
i
would
sooner
marry
a
toad
why
did
you
know
olaf
i
thought
of
course
you
knew
you
had
been
introducing
athletics
and
better
manners
among
the
peerage
that
sounds
like
a
bill
in
the
house
of
commons
does
it
then
miss
stapylton
laughed
again
and
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
agreeable
though
somewhat
nervous
elation
i
wrote
to
him
two
days
ago
she
afterward
explained
breaking
off
the
engagement
so
he
came
down
at
once
and
was
very
nasty
about
it
you
you
have
broken
your
engagement
he
echoed
dully
and
continued
with
a
certain
deficiency
of
finesse
but
i
thought
you
wanted
to
be
a
countess
oh
you
boor
you
vulgarian
the
girl
cried
oh
you
do
put
things
so
crudely
olaf
you
are
hopeless
she
shook
an
admonitory
forefinger
in
his
direction
and
pouted
in
the
most
dangerous
fashion
but
he
always
seemed
so
nice
she
reflected
with
puckered
brows
until
you
know
i
thought
he
would
be
eminently
suitable
i
liked
him
tremendously
until
and
here
a
wonderful
tender
change
came
into
her
face
a
wistful
quaver
woke
in
her
voice
until
i
found
there
was
some
one
else
i
liked
better
ah
said
rudolph
musgrave
so
that
was
it
yes
that
was
it
her
head
was
bowed
now
her
glorious
proud
little
head
and
she
sat
silent
an
abashed
heap
of
fluffy
frills
and
ruffles
a
tiny
bundle
of
vaporous
ruchings
and
filmy
tucks
and
suchlike
vanities
in
the
green
dusk
of
the
but
he
knew
he
had
seen
her
face
grave
and
tender
in
the
twilight
and
he
knew
she
loved
some
man
some
lucky
devil
ah
yes
that
was
it
and
he
knew
the
love
he
had
unwittingly
spied
upon
to
be
august
the
shamed
exultance
of
her
face
and
her
illumined
eyes
the
crimson
banners
her
cheeks
had
flaunted
these
were
to
colonel
musgrave
as
a
piece
of
sacred
pageantry
and
before
it
his
misery
was
awed
his
envy
went
posting
to
extinction
thus
the
stupid
man
reflected
and
made
himself
very
unhappy
over
it
then
after
a
little
the
girl
threw
back
her
head
and
drew
a
deep
breath
and
flashed
a
tremulous
smile
at
him
ah
yes
said
she
there
are
better
things
in
life
than
coronets
are
there
olaf
you
should
have
seen
how
he
caught
up
the
word
life
he
cried
with
a
bitter
thrill
of
speech
ah
what
do
i
know
of
life
i
am
only
a
recluse
a
dreamer
a
visionary
you
must
learn
of
life
from
the
men
who
have
lived
patricia
i
have
ever
lived
i
have
always
chosen
the
coward
part
i
have
chosen
to
shut
myself
off
from
the
world
to
posture
in
a
village
all
my
days
and
to
consider
its
trifles
as
of
supreme
importance
i
have
affected
to
scorn
that
brave
world
yonder
where
a
man
is
proven
and
all
the
while
i
was
afraid
of
it
i
think
i
was
afraid
of
you
before
you
came
at
the
thought
of
this
rudolph
musgrave
laughed
as
he
fell
to
pacing
up
and
down
before
her
life
he
cried
again
with
a
helpless
gesture
and
then
smiled
at
her
very
sadly
i
know
there
was
something
better
in
life
than
grubbing
after
musty
tribes
and
customs
and
he
quoted
why
what
a
question
to
ask
of
a
professional
genealogist
do
you
realize
patricia
that
the
very
bread
i
eat
is
actually
earned
by
the
achievements
of
people
who
have
been
dead
for
centuries
and
in
part
of
course
by
tickling
the
vanity
of
living
snobs
that
constitutes
a
nice
trade
for
an
person
as
long
as
men
are
paid
for
emptying
now
does
it
and
yet
it
is
not
altogether
for
the
pay
sake
i
do
it
he
added
haltingly
there
really
is
a
fascination
about
the
work
you
are
really
working
out
a
puzzle
like
a
fellow
solving
a
it
is
really
work
it
is
amusement
and
when
you
are
establishing
a
royal
descent
and
tracing
back
to
czars
and
plantagenets
and
merovingians
and
making
it
all
seem
perfectly
plausible
the
thing
is
sheer
impudent
flagrant
art
and
are
the
artist
he
broke
off
here
and
shrugged
no
i
could
hardly
make
you
understand
it
does
matter
it
is
enough
that
i
have
bartered
youth
and
happiness
and
the
very
power
of
living
for
the
privilege
of
grubbing
in
old
county
records
he
paused
it
is
debatable
if
he
had
spoken
wisely
or
had
spoken
even
in
consonance
with
fact
but
his
outburst
had
at
least
the
saving
grace
of
sincerity
he
was
pallid
now
shaking
in
every
limb
and
in
his
heart
was
a
dull
aching
she
seemed
so
incredibly
soft
and
little
and
childlike
as
she
looked
up
at
him
with
troubled
eyes
i
i
do
quite
understand
she
murmured
it
is
as
if
you
were
an
old
man
olaf
it
is
as
if
but
he
had
scarcely
heard
her
ah
child
child
he
cried
why
did
you
come
to
waken
me
i
was
content
in
my
smug
vanities
i
was
content
in
my
ignorance
i
could
have
gone
on
contentedly
grubbing
through
my
musty
sleepy
life
here
till
death
had
taken
me
if
only
you
had
not
shown
me
what
life
might
mean
ah
child
child
why
did
you
waken
me
i
she
breathed
and
now
the
flush
of
her
cheeks
had
widened
wondrously
you
you
he
cried
and
gave
a
wringing
motion
of
his
hands
for
the
of
a
complacent
man
is
not
torn
away
without
agony
who
else
but
you
i
had
thought
myself
brave
enough
to
be
silent
but
still
i
must
play
the
coward
part
that
woman
i
told
you
of
that
woman
i
loved
was
you
yes
you
you
he
cried
again
and
again
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
and
then
on
a
sudden
colonel
musgrave
began
to
laugh
it
is
very
ridiculous
is
it
he
demanded
of
her
yes
it
is
very
very
funny
now
comes
the
time
to
laugh
at
me
now
comes
the
time
to
lift
your
brows
and
to
make
keen
arrows
of
your
eyes
and
of
your
tongue
a
little
red
dagger
i
have
dreamed
of
this
moment
many
and
many
a
time
so
laugh
i
say
laugh
for
i
have
told
you
that
i
love
you
you
are
rich
and
i
am
a
pauper
you
are
young
and
i
am
old
remember
and
i
love
you
who
love
another
man
for
the
love
of
god
laugh
at
me
and
have
done
laugh
for
as
god
lives
it
is
the
bravest
jest
i
have
ever
known
but
she
came
to
him
with
a
wonderful
gesture
of
compassion
and
caught
his
great
shapely
hands
in
hers
i
i
knew
you
cared
she
breathed
i
have
always
known
you
cared
i
would
have
been
an
idiot
if
i
had
but
oh
olaf
i
did
know
you
cared
so
much
you
frighten
me
olaf
she
pleaded
and
raised
a
tearful
face
to
his
i
am
very
fond
of
you
olaf
dear
oh
do
think
i
am
not
fond
of
you
and
the
girl
paused
for
a
breathless
moment
i
think
i
might
have
married
you
olaf
she
said
if
if
it
had
been
for
one
thing
rudolph
musgrave
smiled
now
though
he
found
it
a
difficult
business
yes
he
assented
gravely
i
know
dear
if
it
were
not
for
the
other
man
that
lucky
devil
yes
he
is
a
very
very
lucky
devil
child
and
he
constitutes
rather
a
big
does
he
miss
stapylton
too
smiled
a
little
no
said
she
that
is
quite
the
reason
the
real
reason
is
as
i
told
you
yesterday
that
i
quite
fail
to
see
how
you
can
expect
any
woman
to
marry
you
you
if
you
wo
go
to
the
trouble
of
asking
her
to
do
so
and
this
time
miss
stapylton
did
not
go
into
the
house
vii
when
they
went
in
to
supper
they
had
planned
to
tell
miss
agatha
of
their
secret
at
once
but
the
colonel
comprehended
at
the
first
glimpse
of
his
sister
that
the
opportunity
would
be
the
meal
was
an
awkward
miss
agatha
from
the
head
of
the
table
did
very
little
talking
save
occasionally
to
evince
views
of
life
that
were
both
lachrymose
and
pugnacious
and
the
lovers
talked
with
desperate
cheerfulness
so
that
there
might
be
no
outbreak
so
long
as
pilkins
preëminently
ceremonious
among
butlers
and
as
yet
inclined
to
scoff
at
the
notion
that
the
musgraves
of
matocton
were
not
divinely
entrusted
to
his
guardianship
was
in
the
room
coming
so
close
upon
the
heels
of
his
high
hour
this
contretemps
of
agatha
having
one
of
her
attacks
seemed
more
to
rudolph
musgrave
than
a
man
need
rationally
bear
with
equanimity
perhaps
it
was
a
trifle
stiffly
that
he
said
he
did
not
care
for
any
raspberries
his
sister
burst
into
tears
that
all
the
thanks
i
get
i
slave
my
life
out
and
what
thanks
do
i
get
for
it
i
never
have
any
pleasure
i
never
put
my
foot
out
of
the
house
except
to
go
to
market
and
what
thanks
do
i
get
for
it
what
i
want
you
to
tell
me
with
the
first
raspberries
of
the
season
that
what
i
want
oh
i
do
wonder
you
ca
look
me
in
the
eye
and
i
wish
i
was
dead
that
what
i
wish
colonel
musgrave
did
not
turn
at
once
toward
patricia
when
his
sister
had
stumbled
weeping
from
the
i
i
am
so
sorry
olaf
said
a
remote
and
tiny
voice
then
he
touched
her
hand
with
his
ever
so
lightly
you
must
not
worry
about
it
dear
i
daresay
i
was
unpardonably
brusque
and
agatha
health
is
not
good
so
that
she
is
a
trifle
irritable
at
times
why
good
lord
we
have
these
little
ever
so
often
and
never
give
them
a
thought
afterwards
that
is
one
of
the
many
things
the
future
musgrave
will
have
to
get
accustomed
to
eh
or
does
that
appalling
prospect
frighten
you
too
much
and
patricia
brazenly
confessed
that
it
did
not
she
also
made
a

to
regard

as
an
irrelevant
vagary
of
certain

probably
ornery

as
an

when
the
presidential
campaign
was
at
its
height
when
in
various
sections
of
the
united
states
the
boy
orator
of
la
platte
was
making
invidious
remarks
concerning
the
republican
party
and
in
canton
ohio
hanna
was
cheerfully
expressing
his
confidence
as
to
the
outcome
of
it
all
when
the
czar
and
the
czarina
were
visiting
president
faure
in
paris
amid
unparalleled
enthusiasm
and
when
people
were
appraising
with
a
glibness
possible
to
ignorance
only
the
literary
achievements
of
william
morris
and
george

who
had
just
died
at

the

in
the
extreme
degree
of
lichfieldian
elegance
colonel
musgrave
was
his
mentor
throughout
the
process
and
the
oldest
families
of
lichfield
very
shortly
sat
at
table
with
the
former
overseer
and
not
at
all
unwillingly
since
his
dinners
were
excellent
and
an
infatuated
rudolph
musgrave
an
axiom
now
in
planning
any
list
of
guests
was
very
shortly
to
marry
the
daughter
in
fact
the
matter
had
been
settled
and
colonel
musgrave
had
received
from
roger
stapylton
an
exuberantly
granted
charter
of
courtship
this
befell
indeed
upon
a
red
letter
day
in
roger
stapylton
life
the
banker
was
in
business
matters
wonderfully
shrewd
as
divers
transactions
since
the
signing
of
that
contract
whereby
he
was
to
furnish
a
certain
number
of
mules
for
the
confederate
service
strikingly
attested
but
he
had
rarely
been
out
of
the
country
wherein
his
mother
bore
him
and
where
another
nabob
might
have
dreamed
of
an
earl
or
even
have
soared
aspiringly
in
imagination
toward
a
for
his
only
child
old
stapylton
retained
unshaken
faith
in
the
creed
of
his
youth
he
had
tolerated
pevensey
had
indeed
been
prepared
to
purchase
him
much
as
he
would
have
ordered
any
other
expensive
trinket
or
knickknack
which
patricia
desired
but
he
had
never
viewed
the
match
with
enthusiasm
now
though
old
stapylton
exulted
his
daughter
half
a
vartrey
already
would
become
by
marriage
a
musgrave
of
matocton
no
less
carriage
would
roll
up
and
down
the
avenue
from
which
he
had
so
often
stepped
aside
with
an
uncovered
head
while
gentlemen
and
ladies
cantered
by
and
it
would
be
pat
children
that
would
play
about
the
corridors
of
the
old
house
at
whose
doors
he
had
lived
so
long
those
corridors
which
he
had
very
rarely
entered
except
on
christmas
day
and
other
recognized
festivities
when
dressed
to
the
nines
the
overseer
and
his
uneasy
mother
were
by
immemorial
custom
made
free
of
the
mansion
with
every
slave
upon
the
big
plantation
they
were
good
days
sir
he
chuckled
heh
we
stick
to
the
old
customs
we
give
a
dinner
and
announce
it
at
dessert
just
as
your
honored
grandfather
did
your
aunt
constantia
betrothal
for
about
the
musgraves
of
matocton
there
could
be
no
question
it
was
the
old
man
delight
to
induce
rudolph
musgrave
to
talk
concerning
his
ancestors
and
stapylton
soon
had
their
history
at
his
he
could
have
correctly
blazoned
every
tincture
in
their
armorial
bearings
and
have
explained
the
origin
of
every
rampant
or
couchant
beast
upon
the
shield
he
knew
it
was
the
in
the
november
of
for
the
first
musgrave
had
settled
in
virginia
prior
to
his
removal
to
lichfield
which
had
the
honor
of
transporting
the
forebear
of
this
family
into
america
stapylton
could
have
told
you
offhand
which
scions
of
the
race
had
represented
this
or
that
particular
county
in
the
house
of
burgesses
and
even
for
what
years
which
three
of
them
were
governors
and
which
of
them
had
served
as
officers
of
the
state
line
in
the
revolution
and
in
fine
was
more
than
satisfied
to
have
his
daughter
play
penelophon
to
colonel
musgrave
debonair
mature
cophetua
in
a
word
roger
stapylton
had
acquiesced
to
the
transferal
of
his
daughter
affections
with
the
peculiar
equanimity
of
a
properly
reared
american
parent
he
merely
stipulated
that
since
his
business
affairs
prevented
an
indefinite
stay
in
lichfield
colonel
musgrave
should
presently
remove
to
new
york
city
where
the
older
man
held
ready
for
him
a
purely
ornamental
and
remunerative
position
with
the
insurance
company
of
which
roger
stapylton
was
president
but
upon
this
point
rudolph
musgrave
was
obdurate
he
had
voiced
and
with
sincerity
as
you
may
remember
his
desire
to
be
proven
upon
a
larger
stage
than
lichfield
afforded
yet
the
sincerity
was
bred
of
an
emotion
it
did
not
survive
unconsciously
rudolph
musgrave
was
reflecting
that
he
was
used
to
living
in
lichfield
and
would
appear
to
disadvantage
in
a
new
surrounding
and
very
probably
would
not
be
half
so
comfortable
aloud
he
said
in
firm
belief
that
he
spoke
truthfully
i
can
not
conscientiously
give
up
the
library
sir
i
realize
the
work
may
not
seem
important
in
your
eyes
indeed
in
anybody
eyes
it
must
seem
an
inadequate
outcome
of
a
man
whole
life
but
it
unfortunately
happens
to
be
the
only
kind
of
work
i
am
capable
of
doing
and
if
you
will
pardon
me
sir
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
honest
for
me
to
accept
this
generous
salary
and
give
nothing
in
return
but
here
patricia
broke
in
patricia
agreed
with
colonel
musgrave
in
every
particular
indeed
had
colonel
musgrave
proclaimed
his
intention
of
setting
up
in
life
as
an
assassin
patricia
would
readily
have
asserted
homicide
to
be
the
most
praiseworthy
of
vocations
as
it
was
she
devoted
no
little
volubility
and
emphasis
and
eulogy
to
the
importance
of
a
genealogist
in
the
eternal
scheme
of
things
and
gave
her
father
candidly
to
understand
that
an
inability
to
appreciate
this
fact
was
necessarily
indicative
of
a
deplorably
low
order
of
intelligence
musgrave
was
to
remember
long
afterward
how
glorious
and
dear
this
mettlesome
and
tiny
woman
had
seemed
to
him
in
the
second
display
of
temper
he
witnessed
in
patricia
it
was
a
revelation
of
an
additional
and
as
yet
unsuspected
adorability
her
father
though
said
pat
i
suspected
for
a
long
time
it
was
foolish
of
me
to
have
a
daughter
thus
he
capitulated
and
with
an
ineffable
air
of
routine
colonel
musgrave
was
in
a
decorous
fashion
the
happiest
of
living
persons
ii
colonel
musgrave
was
in
a
decorous
fashion
the
happiest
of
living
persons
as
a
token
of
this
he
devoted
what
little
ready
money
he
possessed
to
renovating
matocton
where
he
had
not
lived
for
twenty
years
he
rarely
thought
of
money
not
esteeming
it
an
altogether
suitable
subject
for
a
gentleman
meditations
and
to
do
him
justice
the
reflection
that
old
stapylton
wealth
would
some
day
be
at
rudolph
musgrave
disposal
was
never
more
than
an
agreeable
minor
feature
of
patricia
entourage
whenever
as
was
very
often
colonel
musgrave
fell
to
thinking
of
how
adorable
patricia
was
in
every
particular
yet
there
were
times
when
he
thought
of
anne
charteris
as
well
he
had
not
seen
her
for
a
whole
year
now
for
the
charterises
had
left
lichfield
shortly
after
the
pendomer
divorce
case
had
been
settled
and
were
still
in
europe
this
was
the
evening
during
which
roger
stapylton
had
favorably
received
his
declaration
and
colonel
musgrave
was
remembering
the
time
that
he
and
anne
had
last
spoken
with
a
semblance
of
intimacy
that
caustic
time
when
anne
charteris
had
interrupted
him
in
high
words
with
her
husband
and
circumstances
had
afforded
to
rudolph
musgrave
no
choice
save
to
confess
to
this
woman
of
all
created
beings
his
true
relations
with
clarice
pendomer
even
as
yet
the
bitterness
of
that
humiliation
was
not
savorless
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
never
bear
to
think
of
the
night
when
anne
had
heard
his
stammerings
through
and
had
merely
listened
and
in
listening
had
been
unreasonably
beautiful
so
godiva
might
have
looked
on
peeping
tom
with
more
of
wonder
than
of
loathing
just
at
first
it
had
been
very
hard
to
bear
but
it
seemed
necessary
the
truth
would
have
hurt
anne
too
much
he
noted
with
the
gusto
of
a
connoisseur
how
neatly
the
dénouement
of
this
piteous
farce
had
been
prepared
his
rage
with
charteris
overhearing
and
misinterpretation
of
a
dozen
angry
words
that
old
affair
with
clarice
immediately
before
her
marriage
one
of
how
many
pleasurable
gallantries
the
colonel
idly
wondered
and
regretted
that
he
had
no
leporello
to
keep
them
catalogued
for
consultation
and
george
pendomer
jealousy
of
rudolph
musgrave
all
fitted
in
as
neatly
as
the
bits
of
a
puzzle
it
had
been
the
simplest
matter
in
the
world
to
shield
john
charteris
yet
the
colonel
wished
he
could
be
sure
it
was
an
unadulterated
desire
of
protecting
anne
which
had
moved
him
there
had
been
very
certainly
an
enjoyment
all
the
while
in
reflecting
how
nobly
rudolph
musgrave
was
behaving
for
the
sake
of
the
only
woman
he
had
ever
loved
yes
one
had
undoubtedly
phrased
it
thus
then
and
until
the
time
one
met
patricia
but
anne
was
different
and
in
the
nature
of
things
must
always
be
a
little
different
from
all
other
people
even
patricia
stapylton
always
in
reverie
the
colonel
would
come
back
to
this
that
anne
could
not
be
thought
of
quite
in
the
same
frame
of
mind
wherein
one
appraised
other
persons
especially
must
he
concede
this
curious
circumstance
whenever
as
he
considered
divers
matters
that
had
taken
place
quite
long
enough
ago
to
have
been
forgotten
it
was
a
foolish
sort
of
a
reverie
and
scarcely
worth
the
setting
down
it
was
a
reverie
of
the
kind
that
everyone
and
especially
wife
admits
to
be
mawkish
and
unprofitable
and
yet
somehow
the
next
still
summer
night
or
long
sleepy
sunday
afternoon
or
perhaps
some
cheap
jigging
and
heartbreaking
melody
will
set
a
carnival
of
old
loves
and
old
faces
awhirl
in
the
brain
one
grows
very
sad
over
it
of
course
and
it
becomes
apparent
that
one
has
always
been
by
the
world
but
the
sadness
is
not
unpleasant
and
one
is
quite
willing
to
forgive
yes
it
was
a
long
long
time
ago
it
must
have
been
a
great
number
of
centuries
matocton
was
decked
in
its
spring
fripperies
of
burgeoning
and
the
sky
was
a
great
pale
turquoise
and
the
buttercups
left
a
golden
dust
high
up
on
one
trousers
one
had
not
become
entirely
accustomed
to
long
trousers
then
and
one
was
rather
proud
of
them
one
was
lying
on
one
back
in
the
woods
where
the
birds
were
astir
and
eager
to
begin
their
and
twittered
hysterically
over
the
potentialities
of
straws
and
broken
twigs
overhead
the
swelling
buds
of
trees
were
visible
against
the
sky
and
the
branches
were
like
grotesque
designs
on
a
japanese
plate
there
was
a
little
clump
of
moss
very
cool
and
soft
that
just
brushed
cheek
one
was
thinking
really
thinking
for
the
first
time
in
one
life
and
curiously
enough
one
was
thinking
about
a
girl
although
girls
were
manifestly
of
no
earthly
importance
but
anne
willoughby
was
different
even
at
the
age
when
girls
seemed
feckless
creatures
whose
aimings
were
inexplicable
both
as
concerned
existence
in
general
and
more
concretely
as
touched
and
snowballs
and
whose
reasons
for
bursting
into
tears
were
recondite
one
had
perceived
the
difference
one
wondered
about
it
from
time
to
time
gradually
there
awoke
an
uneasy
interest
as
to
all
matters
that
concerned
her
a
mental
pricking
up
of
the
ears
when
her
name
was
mentioned
one
lay
awake
o
nights
wondering
why
her
hair
curled
so
curiously
about
her
temples
and
held
such
queer
glowing
tints
in
its
depths
when
sunlight
fell
upon
it
one
was
uncomfortable
and
embarrassed
and
in
her
presence
but
with
her
absence
came
the
overwhelming
desire
of
seeing
her
again
after
a
little
it
was
quite
understood
that
one
was
in
love
with
anne
willoughby
it
was
a
matter
of
minor
importance
that
her
father
was
the
wealthiest
man
in
fairhaven
and
that
one
mother
was
poor
one
would
go
away
into
foreign
lands
after
a
while
and
come
back
with
a
great
deal
of
money
lakes
of
rupees
and
pieces
of
eight
probably
it
was
very
simple
but
anne
father
had
taken
an
unreasonable
view
of
the
matter
and
carried
anne
off
to
a
terrible
aunt
who
returned
one
letters
unopened
that
was
the
end
of
anne
willoughby
then
after
an
interval
during
which
one
fell
in
and
out
of
love
assiduously
and
had
upon
the
whole
a
pleasant
time
anne
charteris
had
come
to
lichfield
one
had
found
that
time
had
merely
added
poise
and
and
a
certain
opulence
to
the
beauty
which
had
caused
one
voice
to
play
fantastic
tricks
in
conference
with
anne
willoughby
ancient
unforgotten
conferences
wherein
one
had
pointed
out
the
many
respects
in
which
she
differed
from
all
other
women
and
the
perfect
feasibility
of
marrying
on
nothing
a
year
much
as
one
loved
patricia
and
great
as
was
one
happiness
men
did
not
love
as
boys
did
after
all
boy
it
is
a
dream
for
life
too
high
said
colonel
musgrave
in
his
soul
and
now
let
think
of
something
sensible
let
think
about
the
present
political
crisis
and
what
to
give
the
groomsmen
and
how
much
six
times
seven
is
meanwhile
you
are
not
the
fellow
in
you
know
you
are
not
bothered
by
the
faint
sweet
smell
of
any
foolish
you
understand
or
by
any
equally
foolish
hankerings
after
your
lost
youth
you
are
simply
a
commonplace
sort
of
man
not
thoroughly
hardened
as
yet
to
being
engaged
and
you
are
feeling
a
bit
pulled
down
because
your
liver
or
something
is
out
of
sorts
upon
reflection
colonel
musgrave
was
quite
sure
that
he
was
happy
and
that
it
was
only
his
liver
or
something
which
was
upset
but
at
all
events
the
colonel
besetting
infirmity
was
always
to
shrink
from
making
changes
instinctively
he
balked
against
commission
of
any
action
which
would
alter
his
relations
with
accustomed
circumstances
or
persons
it
was
very
like
rudolph
musgrave
that
even
now
for
all
the
glow
of
the
future
bright
allure
his
heart
should
hark
back
to
the
past
and
its
absurd
dear
memories
with
wistfulness
and
he
found
it
as
many
others
have
done
but
cheerless
sexton
work
this
digging
up
of
boyish
recollections
one
by
one
they
come
to
light
the
brave
hopes
and
dreams
and
aspirations
of
youth
the
ruddy
life
has
gone
out
of
them
they
have
shriveled
into
an
alien
pathetic
dignity
they
might
have
been
one
or
hannibal
or
adam
the
boy
whose
life
was
swayed
by
them
is
quite
as
dead
as
these
amaryllis
is
dead
too
perhaps
you
drop
in
of
an
afternoon
to
talk
over
old
happenings
she
is
perfectly
affable
she
thinks
it
is
time
you
were
married
she
thinks
it
very
becoming
the
way
you
have
stoutened
and
no
they
were
at
the
robinsons
that
was
the
night
little
amaryllis
was
threatened
with
croup
then
after
a
little
the
lamps
of
welcome
are
lighted
in
her
eyes
her
breath
quickens
her
cheeks
mount
crimson
flags
in
honor
of
her
lord
her
hero
her
conqueror
it
is
grundy
who
is
happy
to
meet
you
and
hopes
you
will
stay
to
dinner
he
patronizes
you
a
trifle
his
wife
you
see
has
told
him
all
about
that
boy
who
is
as
dead
as
hannibal
you
do
mind
in
the
least
you
dine
with
and
grundy
and
pass
a
very
pleasant
evening
colonel
musgrave
had
dined
often
with
the
charterises
iii
and
then
some
frolic
god
from
homicide
by
means
of
an
unloaded
pistol
in
chicago
for
the
demolishment
of
a
likely
ship
off
palos
with
the
coöperancy
of
a
defective
pistonrod
stayed
in
his
flight
to
bring
joe
parkinson
to
lichfield
it
was
roger
stapylton
who
told
the
colonel
of
this
advent
as
the
very
apex
of
jocularity
for
you
remember
the
parkinsons
i
suppose
the
ones
that
had
a
cabin
near
matocton
very
deserving
people
i
believe
and
son
sir
wants
to
marry
my
daughter
said
stapylton
daughter
who
is
shortly
to
be
connected
by
marriage
with
the
musgraves
of
matocton
i
do
know
what
this
world
will
come
to
next
it
was
a
treat
to
see
him
shake
his
head
in
deprecation
of
such
anarchy
then
roger
stapylton
said
more
truculently
yes
sir
on
account
of
a
affair
five
years
ago
this
this
trash
has
actually
had
the
presumption
sir
but
i
do
doubt
that
pat
has
told
you
all
about
it
why
no
said
colonel
musgrave
she
did
not
mention
it
this
afternoon
she
was
not
feeling
very
well
a
slight
headache
i
noticed
she
was
not
inclined
to
conversation
it
had
just
occurred
to
him
as
mildly
remarkable
that
patricia
had
never
at
any
time
alluded
to
any
one
of
those
countless
men
who
must
have
inevitably
made
love
to
her
though
mind
you
i
do
say
anything
against
joe
he
a
fine
young
fellow
paid
his
own
way
through
college
done
good
work
in
panama
and
in
alaska
too
but
confound
it
sir
the
boy
a
fool
now
i
put
it
to
you
fairly
ai
he
a
fool
said
stapylton
upon
my
word
sir
if
his
folly
has
no
other
proof
than
an
adoration
of
your
daughter
the
colonel
protested
i
must
in
beg
leave
to
differ
with
you
yes
that
was
it
undoubtedly
patricia
had
too
high
a
sense
of
honor
to
exhibit
these
defeated
rivals
in
a
ridiculous
light
even
to
him
it
was
a
revelation
of
an
additional
and
as
yet
unsuspected
adorability
then
after
a
little
further
talk
they
separated
colonel
musgrave
left
that
night
for
matocton
in
order
to
inspect
the
improvements
which
were
being
made
there
he
was
to
return
to
lichfield
on
the
ensuing
wednesday
when
his
engagement
to
patricia
was
to
be
announced
just
as
your
honored
grandfather
did
your
aunt
constantia
betrothal
meanwhile
joe
parkinson
a
young
man
much
enamored
who
fought
the
world
by
ordinary
like
hal
o
the
wynd
for
his
own
hand
was
seeing
patricia
every
day
iv
colonel
musgrave
remained
five
days
at
matocton
that
he
might
put
his
house
in
order
against
his
nearing
marriage
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
the
colonel
stroll
about
the
paneled
corridors
and
pause
to
chat
with
divers
deferential
workmen
who
were
putting
the
last
touches
there
or
to
observe
him
in
affable
consultation
with
gardeners
anent
the
rolling
of
a
lawn
or
the
retrimming
of
a
rosebush
and
to
mark
the
bearing
of
the
man
so
optimistically
colored
by
goodwill
toward
the
solar
system
he
joyed
in
his
old
home
in
the
hipped
roof
of
it
the
mullioned
casements
the
wide
the
high
and
spacious
rooms
the
geometrical
gardens
and
broad
lawns
in
all
that
was
quaint
and
beautiful
at
matocton
because
it
would
be
patricia
so
very
soon
the
lovely
frame
of
a
yet
lovelier
picture
as
the
colonel
phrased
it
with
a
flight
of
imagery
gravely
he
inspected
all
the
portraits
of
his
feminine
ancestors
that
he
might
decide
as
one
without
bias
whether
matocton
had
ever
boasted
a
more
delectable
mistress
equity
or
in
his
fond
eyes
at
least
demanded
a
negative
only
in
one
of
these
canvases
a
counterfeit
of
miss
evelyn
ramsay
born
a
ramsay
of
blenheim
that
had
married
the
common
of
both
the
colonel
and
patricia
major
orlando
musgrave
an
to
general
charles
lee
in
the
revolution
rudolph
musgrave
found
or
seemed
to
find
dear
likenesses
to
that
demented
seraph
who
was
about
to
stoop
to
his
unworthiness
he
spent
much
time
before
this
portrait
yes
yes
this
woman
had
been
lovely
in
her
day
and
this
bright
roguish
shadow
of
her
was
lovely
too
eternally
postured
in
white
patnet
trimmed
with
a
vine
of
satin
leaves
a
pink
rose
in
her
powdered
hair
and
a
huge
ostrich
plume
as
well
yet
it
was
an
adamantean
colonel
that
remarked
my
dear
perhaps
it
is
just
as
fortunate
as
not
that
you
have
quitted
matocton
for
i
have
heard
tales
of
you
miss
ramsay
oh
no
i
honestly
do
not
believe
that
you
would
have
taken
kindlily
to
any
young
person
not
even
in
the
guise
of
a
to
whom
you
can
not
hold
a
candle
madam
a
fico
for
you
madam
said
the
most
undutiful
of
let
us
leave
him
to
his
roseate
meditations
questionless
in
the
woman
he
loved
there
was
much
of
his
own
invention
but
the
circumstance
is
not
unhackneyed
and
colonel
musgrave
was
in
a
decorous
fashion
the
happiest
of
living
persons
meanwhile
joe
parkinson
a
young
man
much
enamored
who
fought
the
world
by
ordinary
like
hal
o
the
wynd
for
his
own
hand
was
seeing
patricia
every
day
v
joe
parkinson
tall
and
tanned
resolute
chary
of
speech
decisive
in
gesture
having
yellow
hair
and
frank
keen
eyes
like
amethysts
was
the
one
alien
present
when
colonel
musgrave
came
again
into
roger
stapylton
fine
and
mansion
this
was
on
the
evening
roger
stapylton
gave
the
dinner
at
which
he
was
to
announce
his
daughter
engagement
as
much
indeed
was
suspected
by
most
of
his
so
carefully
selected
from
the
aristocracy
of
lichfield
and
the
heart
of
the
former
overseer
as
these
handsome
courtly
and
sweet
voiced
people
settled
according
to
their
rank
about
his
sumptuous
table
was
aglow
with
pride
then
rudolph
musgrave
turned
to
his
companion
and
said
softly
my
dear
you
are
like
a
wraith
what
is
it
i
have
a
headache
said
patricia
it
is
nothing
you
reassure
me
the
colonel
gaily
declared
for
i
had
feared
it
was
a
heartache
she
faced
him
desperation
looked
out
of
her
purple
eyes
it
is
the
girl
said
swiftly
ah
only
it
was
an
intake
of
the
breath
rather
than
an
interjection
colonel
musgrave
ate
his
fish
with
deliberation
young
parkinson
he
presently
suggested
i
thought
i
had
forgotten
him
i
did
know
i
cared
i
did
know
i
care
so
much
and
there
was
a
note
in
her
voice
which
thrust
the
poor
colonel
into
an
abyss
of
consternation
remember
that
these
people
are
your
guests
he
said
in
perfect
and
i
refused
him
this
afternoon
for
the
last
time
and
he
is
going
away
but
here
judge
allardyce
broke
in
to
tell
miss
stapylton
of
the
pleasure
with
which
he
had
the
case
against
tom
bellingham
a
son
of
my
old
schoolmate
the
judge
explained
a
bellingham
of
assequin
oh
indiscreet
of
course
but
god
bless
my
soul
when
were
the
bellinghams
anything
else
the
boy
regretted
it
as
much
as
anybody
and
she
listened
with
almost
morbid
curiosity
concerning
the
finer
details
of
legal
intricacy
colonel
musgrave
was
in
an
anecdote
which
the
lady
upon
the
other
side
of
him
found
wickedly
amusing
he
was
very
gay
he
had
presently
secured
the
attention
of
the
company
at
large
and
held
it
through
a
good
for
by
common
consent
rudolph
musgrave
was
at
his
best
and
lichfield
found
his
best
worth
listening
to
grinning
old
popinjay
thought
parkinson
and
envied
him
and
internally
noted
and
with
an
unholy
fervor
cursed
the
adroitness
of
intonation
and
the
discreetly
modulated
gesture
with
which
the
colonel
gave
to
every
point
of
his
its
precise
value
the
colonel
mind
was
working
busily
on
matters
oddly
apart
from
those
of
which
he
talked
he
wanted
this
girl
next
to
him
at
whom
he
did
not
look
he
loved
her
as
that
whippersnapper
yonder
was
not
capable
of
loving
anyone
young
people
had
these
fancies
and
they
outlived
them
as
the
colonel
knew
of
his
own
experience
let
matters
take
their
course
unhindered
at
all
events
by
him
for
it
was
less
his
part
than
that
of
any
other
man
alive
to
interfere
when
rudolph
musgrave
stood
within
a
finger
reach
of
at
worst
his
own
prosperity
and
happiness
he
would
convey
no
note
to
roger
stapylton
let
the
banker
announce
the
engagement
let
the
young
fellow
go
to
the
devil
colonel
musgrave
would
marry
the
girl
and
make
patricia
at
worst
content
to
do
otherwise
even
to
hesitate
would
be
the
emptiest
quixotism
then
came
the
fatal
thought
but
what
a
gesture
to
fling
away
his
happiness
yes
even
his
worldly
fortune
and
to
do
it
smilingly
patricia
must
perforce
admire
him
all
her
life
then
as
old
stapylton
stirred
in
his
chair
and
broke
into
a
wide
premonitory
smile
colonel
musgrave
rose
to
his
feet
and
of
that
company
clarice
pendomer
at
least
thought
of
how
like
he
was
to
the
boy
who
had
fought
the
famous
duel
with
george
pendomer
some
fifteen
years
ago
ensued
a
felicitous
speech
rudolph
musgrave
was
familiar
with
his
audience
and
therefore
colonel
musgrave
alluded
briefly
to
the
pleasure
he
took
in
addressing
such
a
gathering
he
believed
no
other
state
in
the
could
have
afforded
an
assembly
of
more
distinguished
men
and
fairer
women
but
the
fact
was
not
unnatural
they
might
recall
the
venerable
saying
that
blood
will
tell
well
it
was
their
peculiar
privilege
to
represent
that
sturdy
stock
which
when
this
great
republic
was
in
the
pangs
of
birth
had
with
sword
and
pen
and
oratory
discomfited
the
hirelings
of
england
and
given
to
history
the
undying
names
of
several
revolutionary
patriots
all
of
whom
he
enumerated
with
the
customary
pause
after
each
cognomen
to
allow
for
the
customary
applause
and
theirs
too
was
the
blood
of
those
heroic
men
who
fought
more
recently
beneath
the
stars
and
bars
as
bravely
he
would
make
bold
to
say
as
leonidas
at
thermopylae
in
defense
of
their
loved
southland
right
he
conceded
had
not
triumphed
here
for
hordes
of
brutal
soldiery
had
invaded
the
fertile
soil
the
tempest
of
war
had
swept
the
land
and
left
it
desolate
the
south
lay
battered
and
bruised
and
pros
trate
in
blood
the
niobe
of
nations
as
sad
a
victim
of
ingratitude
as
king
lear
the
colonel
touched
upon
the
time
when
buzzards
in
the
guise
of
had
battened
upon
the
recumbent
form
and
spoke
slightingly
of
divers
persons
of
antiquity
as
compared
with
various
confederate
leaders
whose
names
were
greeted
with
approving
nods
and
ripples
of
polite
enthusiasm
but
the
south
and
in
particular
the
grand
old
commonwealth
which
they
inhabited
he
stated
had
not
long
sat
among
the
ruins
of
her
temples
like
a
sorrowing
priestess
with
veiled
eyes
and
a
depressed
soul
mourning
for
that
which
had
been
like
the
fabled
phoenix
she
had
risen
from
the
ashes
of
her
past
she
was
once
more
to
be
seen
in
her
hereditary
position
the
brightest
gem
in
all
that
glorious
galaxy
of
states
which
made
america
the
envy
of
every
other
nation
her
battlefields
converted
into
building
lots
tall
factories
smoked
where
once
a
holocaust
had
flamed
and
where
cannon
had
roared
you
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
school
bell
such
progress
was
without
a
parallel
nor
was
there
any
need
for
him
he
was
assured
to
mention
the
imperishable
names
of
their
dear
homeland
poets
and
statesmen
of
the
orators
and
philanthropists
and
prominent
who
jostled
one
another
in
her
splendid
new
asphalted
streets
since
all
were
quite
familiar
to
his
audience
as
familiar
he
would
venture
to
predict
as
they
would
eventually
be
to
the
most
cherished
recollections
of
macaulay
prophesied
new
zealander
when
this
notorious
antipodean
should
pay
his
long
expected
visit
to
the
ruins
of
paul
in
fine
by
a
natural
series
of
transitions
colonel
musgrave
thus
worked
around
to
the
very
pleasing
duty
with
which
our
host
in
view
of
the
long
and
intimate
connection
between
our
families
has
seen
fit
to
honor
me
which
was
it
developed
to
announce
the
imminent
marriage
of
miss
patricia
stapylton
and
joseph
parkinson
it
may
conservatively
be
stated
that
everyone
was
surprised
old
stapylton
had
half
risen
with
a
purple
face
the
colonel
viewed
him
with
a
look
of
bland
interrogation
there
was
silence
for
a
then
stapylton
lowered
his
eyes
if
just
because
the
laws
of
caste
had
triumphed
and
in
consequence
his
glance
crossed
that
of
his
daughter
who
sat
motionless
regarding
him
she
was
an
unusually
pretty
girl
he
thought
and
he
had
always
been
inordinately
proud
of
her
it
was
not
pride
she
seemed
to
beg
him
muster
now
patricia
through
that
moment
was
not
the
fine
daughter
the
old
man
was
sometimes
half
afraid
of
she
was
too
like
a
certain
defiant
person
oh
of
an
incredible
beauty
such
as
women
had
not
any
longer
who
had
hastily
put
aside
her
bonnet
and
had
looked
at
a
young
roger
stapylton
in
much
this
fashion
very
long
ago
because
the
minister
was
coming
downstairs
and
they
would
presently
be
man
and
wife
provided
always
her
pursuing
brothers
did
not
arrive
in
time
old
roger
stapylton
cleared
his
throat
old
roger
stapylton
said
half
sheepishly
my
foot
asleep
all
i
beg
everybody
pardon
i
sure
please
go
on
he
had
come
within
an
ace
of
saying
rudolph
and
only
in
the
nick
of
time
did
he
continue
colonel
musgrave
so
the
colonel
continued
in
form
with
happy
allusions
to
parkinson
anterior
success
as
an
engineer
before
he
came
like
a
young
lochinvar
to
wrest
away
his
beautiful
and
popular
fiancée
from
us
fainthearted
fellows
of
lichfield
touched
of
course
upon
the
personal
comminglement
of
envy
and
rage
and
so
on
as
an
old
bachelor
who
saw
too
late
what
he
had
missed
in
life
and
concluded
by
proposing
the
health
of
the
young
couple
this
was
drunk
with
all
the
honors
vi
upon
what
patricia
said
to
the
colonel
in
the
what
joe
parkinson
blurted
out
in
the
hall
and
chief
of
all
what
roger
stapylton
asseverated
to
rudolph
musgrave
in
the
library
after
the
other
guests
had
gone
it
is
unnecessary
to
dwell
in
this
place
to
each
of
these
in
various
fashions
did
colonel
musgrave
explain
such
reasons
as
he
variously
explained
must
seem
to
any
gentleman
sufficient
cause
for
acting
as
he
had
done
but
most
candidly
and
even
with
a
touch
of
eloquence
to
roger
stapylton
you
are
like
your
grandfather
sir
at
times
the
latter
said
inconsequently
enough
when
the
colonel
had
finished
and
rudolph
musgrave
gave
a
little
bowing
gesture
with
an
entire
gravity
he
knew
it
was
the
highest
tribute
that
stapylton
could
pay
to
any
man
she
a
daughter
any
father
might
be
proud
of
said
the
banker
also
he
removed
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
looked
at
it
critically
rather
like
her
mother
sometimes
he
said
carelessly
her
mother
made
a
runaway
match
you
may
remember
damn
poor
cigar
this
but
no
you
would
i
reckon
i
had
branched
out
into
cotton
then
and
had
a
little
place
just
outside
of
chiswick
so
that
all
in
all
colonel
musgrave
returned
homeward
not
entirely
dissatisfied
vii
the
colonel
sat
for
a
long
while
before
his
fire
that
night
the
room
seemed
less
comfortable
than
he
had
ever
known
it
so
many
of
his
books
and
pictures
and
other
furnishings
had
been
already
carried
to
matocton
that
the
walls
were
a
little
bare
also
there
was
a
formidable
pile
of
bills
upon
the
table
by
him
from
contractors
and
upholsterers
and
and
so
on
who
had
been
concerned
in
the
late
renovation
of
matocton
the
heralds
of
a
host
he
hardly
saw
his
way
to
dealing
with
he
had
flung
away
a
deal
of
money
that
evening
with
something
which
to
him
was
dearer
had
you
attempted
to
condole
with
him
he
would
not
have
understood
you
but
what
would
you
have
had
a
gentleman
do
sir
colonel
musgrave
would
have
said
in
real
perplexity
besides
it
was
in
fact
not
sorrow
that
he
felt
rather
it
was
contentment
when
he
remembered
the
girl
present
happiness
and
what
alone
depressed
the
colonel
courtly
affability
toward
the
universe
at
large
was
the
queer
horrible
new
sense
of
being
somehow
out
of
touch
with
yesterday
so
comfortable
world
of
being
of
being
almost
old
eh
well
he
said
i
am
of
a
certain
age
undoubtedly
by
an
odd
turn
the
colonel
thought
of
how
his
friends
of
his
own
class
and
generation
had
honestly
admired
the
speech
which
he
had
made
that
evening
and
he
smiled
but
very
tenderly
because
they
were
all
men
and
women
whom
he
loved
the
most
of
us
have
known
each
other
for
a
long
while
the
most
of
us
in
fact
are
of
a
certain
age
i
think
no
people
ever
met
the
sorry
problem
that
we
faced
for
we
were
born
the
masters
of
a
leisured
ordered
world
and
by
a
tragic
quirk
of
destiny
were
thrust
into
a
quite
new
planet
where
we
were
for
a
while
the
inferiors
and
after
that
just
the
competitors
of
yesterday
slaves
we
could
meet
the
new
conditions
oh
for
the
love
of
heaven
let
us
be
frank
and
confess
that
we
have
not
met
them
as
things
practical
go
we
had
the
training
for
it
a
man
who
has
not
been
taught
to
swim
may
rationally
be
excused
for
preferring
to
sit
upon
the
bank
and
should
he
elect
to
ornament
his
idleness
with
protestations
that
he
is
an
excellent
swimmer
because
once
upon
a
time
his
progenitors
were
the
only
people
in
the
world
who
had
the
slightest
conception
of
how
to
perform
a
natatorial
masterpiece
the
thing
is
simply
human
nature
talking
chokes
nobody
worse
luck
and
yet
we
have
done
so
badly
for
the
most
part
we
have
sat
upon
the
bank
our
whole
lives
long
we
have
produced
nothing
after
all
which
was
absolutely
and
we
have
talked
a
deal
of
but
meanwhile
we
have
at
least
enhanced
the
comeliness
of
our
particular
we
have
lived
a
courteous
and
tranquil
and
independent
life
thereon
just
as
our
fathers
taught
us
it
may
be
in
the
final
outcome
of
things
that
will
be
found
an
even
finer
pursuit
than
the
old
one
of
producing
presidents
besides
we
have
produced
ourselves
we
have
been
gentlefolk
in
spite
of
all
we
have
been
true
even
in
our
iniquities
to
the
traditions
of
our
race
no
i
can
not
assert
that
these
traditions
always
square
with
ethics
or
even
with
the
decalogue
for
we
have
added
a
very
complex
eleventh
commandment
concerning
honor
and
for
the
rest
we
have
defiantly
embroidered
life
and
indomitably
we
have
converted
the
commonest
happening
of
life
into
a
comely
thing
we
have
been
artists
if
not
artizans
there
was
upon
the
table
a
large
photograph
in
sepia
of
patricia
stapylton
he
studied
this
now
she
was
very
beautiful
he
thought
thou
detain
her
vesture
hem
said
the
colonel
aloud
oh
that
infernal
yankee
understood
even
though
he
was
born
in
boston
and
this
as
coming
from
a
musgrave
of
matocton
may
fairly
be
considered
as
a
sweeping
tribute
to
the
author
of
all
to
colonel
musgrave
was
intent
upon
the
portrait
so
she
had
chosen
at
last
between
himself
and
this
young
fellow
a
workman
born
of
workmen
who
went
about
the
world
building
bridges
and
canals
and
tunnels
and
such
in
those
far
countries
which
were
to
colonel
musgrave
just
so
many
gray
or
pink
or
splotches
on
the
map
it
seemed
to
colonel
musgrave
almost
an
allegory
so
colonel
musgrave
filled
a
glass
with
the
famed
lafayette
madeira
of
matocton
and
solemnly
drank
yet
another
toast
he
loved
to
do
as
you
already
know
that
which
was
colorful
to
this
new
south
he
said
to
this
new
south
that
has
not
any
longer
need
of
me
or
of
my
kind
to
this
new
south
she
does
not
gaze
unwillingly
nor
too
complacently
upon
old
years
and
dares
concede
that
but
with
loss
of
manliness
may
any
man
encroach
upon
the
heritage
of
a
dog
or
of
a
and
consider
the
exploits
of
an
ancestor
to
guarantee
an
innate
and
personal
excellence
for
to
her
all
former
glory
is
less
a
jewel
than
a
touchstone
and
with
her
portion
of
it
daily
she
appraises
her
own
doing
and
without
vain
speech
and
her
high
past
she
values
now
in
chief
as
fit
foundation
of
that
edifice
whereon
she
labors
day
by
day
and
with
augmenting
strokes
and
yet
it
may
be
he
will
serve
you
better
but
oh
it
possible
that
he
should
love
you
more
than
i
said
colonel
musgrave
of
matocton
the
man
was
destined
to
remember
that
utterance
and
with
the
recollection
to
laugh
not
altogether
in
either
scorn
or
merriment
part
four
appreciation
you
have
chosen
and
i
cry
content
thereto
and
cry
your
pardon
also
and
am
reproved
in
that
i
took
you
for
a
woman
i
loved
odd
centuries
ago
and
would
undo
that
curious
error
nay
your
eyes
are
blue
your
speech
is
gracious
but
you
are
not
she
and
i
am
older
and
changed
how
utterly
i
am
no
longer
i
you
are
not
you
time
destined
as
we
thought
but
to
befriend
and
guerdon
love
like
ours
finds
you
beset
with
joys
and
griefs
i
neither
share
nor
mend
who
am
a
stranger
and
we
two
are
met
nor
wholly
glad
nor
sorry
and
the
end
of
too
much
laughter
is
a
faint
regret
townsend
for
i
next
morning
rudolph
musgrave
found
the
world
no
longer
an
impassioned
place
but
simply
a
familiar
habitation
no
longer
the
of
big
emotions
indeed
but
undoubtedly
a
spot
whatever
were
its
other
pretensions
to
praise
wherein
one
was
at
home
he
breakfasted
on
ham
and
eggs
in
a
state
of
tolerable
equanimity
and
mildly
wondered
at
himself
for
doing
it
the
colonel
was
deep
in
a
heraldic
design
and
was
whistling
through
his
teeth
when
patricia
came
into
the
library
he
looked
up
with
the
outlines
of
a
frown
vanishing
like
pencilings
under
the
of
professional
courtesy
for
he
was
denoting
at
the
moment
which
is
fussy
work
as
it
consists
exclusively
of
dots
then
his
chair
scraped
audibly
upon
the
floor
as
he
pushed
it
from
him
it
occurred
to
rudolph
musgrave
after
an
interval
that
he
was
still
between
sitting
and
standing
and
that
his
mouth
was
open
he
could
hear
a
huckster
outside
on
regis
avenue
the
colonel
never
forgot
the
man
was
crying
fresh
oranges
he
kissed
me
olaf
yes
i
let
him
kiss
me
even
after
he
had
asked
me
if
he
could
no
sensible
girl
would
ever
do
that
of
course
and
then
i
knew
patricia
was
horribly
frightened
and
afterwards
the
made
matters
worse
by
calling
me
darling
there
is
no
more
hateful
word
in
the
english
language
than
it
sounds
like
tastes
or
a
snail
looks
after
you
have
put
salt
on
him
the
colonel
deliberated
this
information
and
he
appeared
to
understand
so
parkinson
has
gone
the
way
of
pevensey
and
of
i
wonder
how
many
others
well
may
heaven
be
very
gracious
to
us
both
he
said
for
i
am
going
to
do
it
then
composedly
he
took
up
the
telephone
upon
his
desk
and
called
roger
stapylton
i
want
you
to
come
at
once
to
rabbet
yes
the
rectory
next
door
to
luke
patricia
and
i
are
to
be
married
there
in
half
an
hour
we
are
on
our
way
to
the
city
hall
to
get
the
license
now
no
she
might
change
her
mind
again
you
see
i
have
not
the
least
notion
how
it
happened
i
do
care
then
you
will
have
to
be
rude
to
him
or
else
not
see
your
only
daughter
married
kindly
permit
me
to
repeat
sir
that
i
do
care
about
that
or
anything
else
and
for
the
rest
patricia
was
last
december
the
colonel
hung
up
the
receiver
and
now
he
said
we
are
going
to
the
city
hall
are
you
said
patricia
with
courteous
interest
well
my
way
lies
uptown
i
have
to
stop
in
at
greenberg
and
get
a
mustard
plaster
for
the
parrot
he
had
his
hat
by
this
it
is
cool
enough
for
me
to
need
an
overcoat
is
it
i
think
you
must
be
crazy
she
said
sharply
of
course
i
am
so
i
am
going
to
marry
you
let
me
go
oh
and
i
had
thought
you
were
a
gentleman
i
fear
that
at
present
i
am
simply
masculine
he
became
aware
that
his
hands
in
gripping
both
her
shoulders
were
hurting
the
girl
come
now
he
continued
will
you
go
quietly
or
will
i
have
to
carry
you
she
said
and
you
would
too
she
spoke
in
wonder
for
patricia
had
glimpsed
an
unguessed
rudolph
musgrave
his
hands
went
under
her
and
he
lifted
her
like
a
feather
he
held
her
thus
at
arm
length
you
you
adorable
whirligig
he
laughed
i
am
a
stronger
animal
than
you
it
would
be
as
easy
for
me
to
murder
you
as
it
would
be
for
you
to
kill
one
of
those
flies
on
the
do
you
quite
understand
that
fact
patricia
oh
but
you
are
an
idiot
in
wanting
you
my
dear
please
put
me
down
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
her
helplessness
he
saw
it
long
before
he
lowered
her
why
not
so
much
in
that
said
miss
stapylton
because
inasmuch
as
i
am
a
woman
of
superlative
charm
of
course
you
ca
help
yourself
but
how
do
you
know
that
rabbet
may
not
be
somewhere
else
harrying
a
defenseless
barkeeper
or
superintending
the
making
of
protectors
for
the
hottentots
or
doing
something
else
clerical
when
we
get
to
the
rectory
after
an
irrelevant
interlude
she
stamped
her
foot
i
do
care
what
you
say
i
wo
marry
an
atheist
if
you
had
the
least
respect
for
his
cloth
olaf
you
would
call
him
up
and
arrange
oh
well
whatever
you
want
to
arrange
and
permit
me
to
powder
my
nose
without
being
bothered
because
i
do
want
people
to
think
you
are
marrying
a
second
helping
to
butter
and
i
never
did
like
that
baptist
man
on
the
block
above
anyhow
and
besides
said
patricia
as
with
the
occurrence
of
a
new
think
what
a
delicious
scandal
it
will
create
ii
patricia
spoke
the
truth
by
lichfield
had
so
industriously
embroidered
the
stapylton
dinner
and
the
ensuing
marriage
with
hypotheses
and
explanations
and
unparented
rumors
that
none
of
the
participants
in
the
affair
but
could
advantageously
have
exchanged
reputations
with
benedict
arnold
or
lucretia
borgia
had
lichfield
believed
a
tithe
of
what
lichfield
was
repeating
a
duel
was
of
course
anticipated
between
parkinson
and
colonel
musgrave
and
the
colonel
indeed
offered
through
major
wadleigh
any
satisfaction
which
parkinson
might
desire
the
engineer
with
garnishments
of
profanity
considered
dueling
to
be
a
absurdity
and
wished
the
old
popinjay
joy
of
his
bargain
lichfield
felt
that
only
showed
what
came
of
treating
trash
as
your
equals
and
gloried
in
the
salutary
moral
iii
meanwhile
the
two
originators
of
so
much
lichfieldian
diversion
were
not
unhappy
but
indeed
it
were
irreverent
even
to
try
to
express
the
happiness
of
their
earlier
married
life
they
were
an
couple
in
so
many
ways
that
no
person
could
conceivably
have
anticipated
in
the
outcome
more
than
decorous
tolerance
of
each
other
for
apart
from
the
disparity
in
age
and
tastes
and
rearing
there
was
always
the
fact
to
be
weighed
that
in
marrying
the
only
child
of
a
wealthy
man
rudolph
musgrave
was
making
what
lichfield
called
an
eminently
sensible
match
than
which
as
lichfield
knew
there
is
no
more
infallible
recipe
for
discord
in
this
case
the
axiom
seemed
after
the
manner
of
all
general
rules
to
bulwark
itself
with
an
exception
colonel
musgrave
continued
to
emanate
an
air
of
contentment
which
fell
perilously
short
of
fatuity
and
that
patricia
was
honestly
fond
of
him
was
evident
to
the
most
impecunious
of
lichfield
bachelors
true
curtains
had
been
lifted
a
little
by
a
little
patricia
could
hardly
have
told
you
at
what
exact
moment
it
was
that
she
discovered
miss
agatha
who
continued
of
course
to
live
with
them
was
a
dipsomaniac
very
certainly
rudolph
musgrave
was
not
informant
it
is
doubtful
if
the
colonel
ever
conceded
his
infirmity
in
his
most
private
meditations
so
that
patricia
found
the
cause
of
miss
agatha
attacks
to
be
an
open
secret
of
which
everyone
in
the
house
seemed
aware
and
of
which
by
tacit
agreement
nobody
ever
spoke
it
bewildered
patricia
at
first
to
find
that
as
concerned
lichfield
at
large
any
in
alcohol
by
a
member
of
the
musgrave
family
was
satisfactorily
accounted
for
by
the
statement
that
the
musgraves
usually
drank
just
as
the
allardyces
notoriously
perpetuated
the
taint
of
insanity
and
the
townsends
were
proverbially
unable
to
let
women
alone
and
the
vartreys
were
deplorably
prone
to
dabble
in
literature
these
things
had
been
for
a
long
while
just
as
they
were
and
therefore
lichfield
estimated
they
must
be
reasonable
then
too
patricia
would
have
preferred
to
have
been
rid
of
the
old
mulatto
woman
virginia
because
it
was
through
virginia
that
miss
agatha
furtively
procured
intoxicants
but
rudolph
musgrave
would
not
consider
virginia
leaving
virginia
faithfulness
has
been
proven
by
too
many
years
of
faithful
service
was
the
formula
with
which
he
dismissed
the
suggestion
afterward
patricia
learned
from
miss
agatha
of
the
wrong
that
had
been
done
virginia
by
olaf
uncle
senator
edward
musgrave
the
noted
orator
and
understood
that
olaf
without
of
course
conceding
it
to
himself
because
that
was
olaf
way
was
trying
to
make
reparation
patricia
respected
the
sentiment
and
continued
to
fret
under
its
manifestation
miss
agatha
also
told
patricia
of
how
the
son
of
virginia
and
senator
musgrave
had
come
to
a
disastrous
end
lynched
in
texas
i
believe
only
it
may
not
have
been
texas
and
indeed
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
believe
it
was
because
i
know
we
first
heard
of
it
on
a
monday
and
virginia
could
do
the
washing
that
week
and
i
had
to
send
it
out
and
for
the
usual
crime
of
course
it
simply
shows
you
how
much
better
off
the
darkies
were
before
the
war
miss
agatha
said
patricia
refrained
from
comment
not
being
willing
to
consider
the
deduction
strained
for
love
is
a
contagious
infection
and
loving
rudolph
musgrave
so
much
patricia
must
perforce
love
any
person
whom
he
loved
as
conscientiously
as
she
would
have
strangled
any
person
with
whom
he
had
flirted
and
yet
to
patricia
it
was
beginning
to
seem
that
patricia
musgrave
was
not
living
altogether
in
that
lichfield
which
john
charteris
has
made
immortal
that
nursery
of
free
principles
according
to
the
wherein
so
many
statesmen
and
orators
were
trained
to
further
the
faith
of
their
fathers
to
thrill
the
listening
senates
draft
constitutions
and
bruise
the
paws
of
the
british
lion
iv
it
may
be
remembered
that
lichfield
had
asked
long
ago
but
who
pray
are
the
stapyltons
it
was
characteristic
of
colonel
musgrave
that
he
went
about
answering
the
question
without
delay
the
stapletons
for
stapylton
was
a
happy
innovation
of
roger
stapylton
dead
wife
the
colonel
knew
to
have
been
farmers
in
brummell
county
and
brummell
courthouse
is
within
an
hour
ride
by
rail
of
lichfield
so
he
set
about
his
labor
of
love
and
in
it
he
excelled
himself
the
records
of
brummell
date
back
to
and
are
voluminous
but
rudolph
musgrave
did
not
overlook
an
item
in
any
will
book
or
in
any
orders
of
the
court
that
pertained
however
remotely
to
the
stapletons
then
he
renewed
his
labors
at
the
courthouse
of
the
older
county
from
which
brummell
was
formed
in
and
through
many
fragmentary
and
unindexed
volumes
indefatigably
pursued
the
family
fortune
back
to
the
immigration
of
its
american
progenitor
in
and
by
the
happiest
fatality
upon
the
same
which
enabled
the
first
american
musgrave
to
grace
the
colony
of
virginia
with
his
presence
it
could
no
longer
be
said
that
the
wife
of
a
musgrave
of
matocton
lacked
an
authentic
and
tolerably
ancient
pedigree
the
colonel
made
a
book
of
his
stapyltonian
researches
which
he
vaingloriously
proclaimed
to
be
the
stupidest
reading
within
the
ample
field
of
uninteresting
printed
english
patricia
was
allowed
to
see
no
word
of
it
until
the
first
ten
copies
had
come
from
the
printer
very
splendid
in
green
and
stamped
with
the
stapylton
in
gold
she
read
the
book
it
is
perfectly
superb
was
her
verdict
it
is
as
dear
as
remembered
kisses
after
death
and
as
sweet
as
a
plaintiff
in
a
suit
only
i
would
have
preferred
it
served
with
a
few
kings
and
dukes
for
parsley
the
stapletons
do
seem
to
have
been
anything
but
perfectly
respectable
mediocrities
the
colonel
smiled
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
shared
regret
that
the
stapylton
pedigree
was
unadorned
by
a
potentate
because
nobody
can
stay
unimpressed
by
a
popular
superstition
however
crass
the
thing
may
be
but
for
all
this
an
appraisal
of
himself
and
his
own
achievements
profusely
showed
high
lineage
is
not
invariably
a
guarantee
of
excellence
and
so
he
smiled
and
said
there
are
two
ends
to
every
stick
it
was
the
stapletons
and
others
of
their
sort
rather
than
any
musgraves
who
converted
a
wilderness
a
little
by
a
little
into
the
america
of
the
task
was
tediously
achieved
and
without
ostentation
and
always
the
ship
had
its
resplendent
as
always
it
had
its
hidden
nay
grimy
engines
which
propelled
the
ship
and
however
direfully
america
may
differ
from
utopia
to
have
assisted
in
the
making
of
america
is
no
mean
distinction
we
musgraves
and
our
peers
i
sometimes
think
may
possibly
have
been
just
gaudy
autumn
leaves
which
happened
to
lie
in
the
path
of
a
high
wind
and
to
cut
a
gallant
figure
in
such
circumstances
does
not
necessarily
prove
the
performer
to
be
a
even
though
he
rides
the
whirlwind
quite
as
splendidly
as
any
bird
existent
patricia
fluttered
and
as
lightly
and
irresponsibly
as
a
wren
might
have
done
perched
on
his
knee
no
there
is
really
something
in
heredity
after
all
now
you
are
a
musgrave
in
every
vein
of
you
it
always
seems
like
a
sort
of
flippancy
for
you
to
appear
in
public
without
a
stock
and
a
tarnished
gilt
frame
with
most
of
the
gilt
knocked
off
and
a
tucked
in
the
corner
patricia
spoke
without
any
regard
for
punctuation
and
i
am
so
unlike
you
i
am
only
a
stapylton
i
do
hope
you
do
mind
my
being
merely
a
stapylton
olaf
because
if
only
i
was
too
modest
to
even
think
of
alluding
to
the
circumstance
i
would
try
to
tell
you
about
the
tiniest
fraction
of
how
much
a
certain
ravishingly
beautiful
loves
you
olaf
and
the
consequences
would
be
deplorable
my
dear
he
began
ouch
said
patricia
you
are
tickling
me
you
do
shave
half
as
often
as
you
used
to
do
you
no
nowadays
you
think
you
have
me
safe
and
do
have
to
bother
about
being
attractive
if
i
had
a
i
could
put
your
face
into
it
and
play
all
sorts
of
tunes
only
i
prefer
to
look
at
it
you
are
a
slattern
and
a
and
a
joy
forever
and
besides
the
first
stapleton
seems
to
have
blundered
somehow
into
the
house
of
burgesses
so
that
entitles
me
to
be
a
colonial
dame
on
my
father
side
too
does
it
olaf
the
colonel
laughed
madam
vanity
said
he
i
repeat
that
to
be
descended
of
a
line
of
czars
or
from
a
house
of
emperors
is
at
the
worst
an
empty
braggartism
or
at
best
upon
the
plea
of
heredity
a
handy
palliation
for
iniquity
and
to
be
descended
of
sturdy
and
honest
and
folk
is
beyond
doubt
preferable
since
upon
quite
similar
grounds
it
entitles
one
to
hope
that
even
now
their
generation
is
gone
when
their
play
is
over
when
their
panorama
is
withdrawn
in
tatters
from
the
stage
of
the
world
there
may
yet
survive
of
them
few
actions
worth
remembering
and
a
few
children
who
have
retained
some
happy
stamp
from
the
disposition
of
their
parents
patricia
with
eyes
widened
in
admiration
at
his
rhetoric
had
turned
an
enticing
shade
of
pink
i
am
glad
of
that
she
said
she
snuggled
so
close
he
could
not
see
her
face
now
she
was
to
all
appearances
attempting
to
twist
the
from
his
coat
i
am
very
glad
that
it
entitles
one
to
hope
about
the
children
because
the
colonel
lifted
her
a
little
from
him
he
did
not
say
anything
but
he
was
regarding
her
half
in
wonder
and
in
worship
she
too
was
silent
presently
she
nodded
he
kissed
her
as
one
does
a
very
holy
relic
it
was
a
moment
to
look
back
upon
always
there
was
no
period
in
rudolph
musgrave
life
when
he
could
not
look
back
upon
this
instant
and
exult
because
it
had
been
his
only
patricia
found
out
afterward
with
an
inexplicable
disappointment
that
her
husband
had
not
been
talking
extempore
but
was
freely
quoting
his
compiler
foreword
just
as
it
figured
in
the
printed
book
one
judges
this
posturing
so
inevitable
of
detection
to
have
been
as
significant
of
much
in
rudolph
musgrave
as
was
the
fact
of
its
belated
discovery
characteristic
of
patricia
yet
she
had
read
this
book
about
her
family
from
purely
normal
motives
first
to
make
certain
how
old
her
various
cousins
were
secondly
to
gloat
over
any
traces
of
distinction
such
as
her
ancestry
afforded
thirdly
to
note
with
what
exaggerated
importance
the
text
seemed
to
accredit
those
relatives
she
did
not
esteem
and
mentally
to
annotate
each
page
with
unprintable
events
which
knew
about
and
fourthly
to
reflect
as
with
a
gush
of
steadily
augmenting
love
how
dear
and
how
unpractical
it
was
of
olaf
to
have
concocted
these
pages
so
staunch
and
blind
in
his
misguided
gratitude
toward
those
otherwise
uninteresting
people
who
had
rendered
possible
the
existence
of
a
patricia
v
matters
went
badly
with
patricia
in
the
ensuing
months
her
blood
told
here
as
colonel
musgrave
saw
with
disquietude
he
knew
the
women
of
his
race
had
by
ordinary
been
unfit
for
childbearing
indeed
the
daughters
of
this
famous
house
had
long
in
a
grim
routine
perished
just
as
patricia
mother
had
done
in
their
first
maternal
essay
there
were
many
hideous
histories
the
colonel
could
have
told
you
of
unmeet
to
be
set
down
and
he
was
familiar
with
this
talk
of
pelvic
anomalies
which
were
congenital
but
he
had
never
thought
of
patricia
till
this
as
being
his
kinswoman
and
in
part
a
musgrave
and
even
now
the
stapylton
blood
that
was
in
her
pulled
patricia
through
long
weeks
of
anguish
surgeons
dealt
with
her
very
horribly
in
a
famed
northern
hospital
whither
she
had
been
removed
by
her
obdurate
request
and
secretly
to
his
own
preference
since
it
was
never
in
his
power
to
meet
discomfort
willingly
colonel
musgrave
had
remained
in
lichfield
patricia
knew
that
officious
people
would
tell
him
her
life
could
be
saved
only
by
the
destruction
of
an
unborn
boy
she
never
questioned
her
child
would
be
a
boy
she
knew
that
olaf
wanted
a
boy
oh
even
more
than
he
does
me
daddy
and
so
he
must
know
you
see
until
it
is
all
over
because
olaf
is
such
an
person
that
he
really
believes
he
prefers
me
pat
her
father
inconsequently
said
i
proud
of
you
and
and
by
god
if
i
to
cry
i
guess
i
am
old
enough
to
know
my
own
mind
and
i
help
you
in
this
if
you
only
promise
not
to
die
in
spite
of
what
these
damn
doctors
say
because
you
pat
and
so
you
realize
a
bargain
is
a
bargain
yes
i
am
really
yours
daddy
it
is
just
my
crazy
body
that
is
a
musgrave
patricia
explained
the
real
me
is
an
unfortunate
stapylton
who
has
somehow
got
locked
up
in
the
wrong
house
it
is
not
a
desirable
residence
you
know
daddy
no
modern
improvements
for
instance
but
i
have
to
live
in
it
still
i
have
not
the
least
intention
of
dying
and
i
solemnly
promise
that
i
wo
so
these
two
hoodwinked
rudolph
musgrave
and
brought
it
about
by
subterfuge
that
his
child
was
born
at
most
he
vaguely
understood
that
patricia
was
having
rather
a
hard
time
of
it
and
steadfastly
drugged
this
knowledge
by
the
performance
of
trivialities
he
was
eating
a
cucumber
sandwich
at
the
moment
young
roger
musgrave
came
into
the
world
and
by
that
action
very
nearly
accomplished
patricia
death
vi
and
the
gods
cursed
roger
stapylton
with
such
a
pride
in
and
so
great
a
love
for
his
only
grandson
that
the
old
man
could
hardly
bear
to
be
out
of
the
infant
presence
he
was
frequently
in
lichfield
nowadays
and
he
renewed
his
demands
that
rudolph
musgrave
give
up
the
librarianship
so
that
the
little
coot
would
be
removed
to
new
york
and
all
three
of
them
be
with
roger
stapylton
always
patricia
had
not
been
well
since
little
roger
birth
it
was
a
peaked
and
shrewish
patricia
rather
than
rudolph
musgrave
who
fought
out
the
long
and
obstinate
battle
with
roger
stapylton
she
was
jealous
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
would
not
have
anyone
not
even
her
father
be
too
fond
of
what
was
preëminently
hers
the
world
at
large
including
rudolph
musgrave
was
at
liberty
to
adore
her
boy
as
was
perfectly
natural
but
not
to
meddle
and
in
fine
patricia
was
both
hysterical
and
vixenish
whenever
a
giving
up
of
the
library
work
was
suggested
the
old
man
did
not
quarrel
with
her
and
with
roger
loneliness
in
these
days
and
the
long
thoughts
it
bred
we
have
nothing
here
to
do
but
when
he
died
stricken
without
warning
some
five
years
after
patricia
marriage
his
will
was
discovered
to
bequeath
practically
his
entire
fortune
to
little
roger
musgrave
when
the
child
should
come
of
age
and
to
rudolph
musgrave
as
patricia
husband
what
was
a
reasonable
income
when
judged
by
lichfield
unexacting
standards
rather
than
by
patricia
anticipations
in
a
word
patricia
found
that
she
and
the
colonel
could
for
the
future
count
upon
a
little
more
than
half
of
the
income
she
had
previously
been
allowed
by
roger
stapylton
it
is
fair
she
said
it
monstrous
and
all
because
you
were
so
obstinate
about
your
picayune
library
patricia
he
began
oh
i
tell
you
it
absurd
olaf
the
money
logically
ought
to
have
been
left
to
me
and
here
i
will
have
to
come
to
you
for
every
penny
of
money
and
heaven
knows
i
have
had
to
scrimp
enough
to
support
us
all
on
what
i
used
to
have
olaf
patricia
said
in
another
voice
olaf
why
what
is
it
dear
i
was
reflecting
said
colonel
musgrave
that
as
you
justly
observe
both
agatha
and
i
have
been
practically
indebted
to
you
for
our
support
these
past
five
years
vii
it
must
be
enregistered
not
to
the
man
credit
but
rather
as
a
simple
fact
that
it
was
never
within
colonel
musgrave
power
to
forget
the
incident
immediately
recorded
he
forgave
when
patricia
wept
seeing
how
his
handsome
face
had
turned
he
forgave
as
promptly
and
as
freely
as
he
was
learning
to
pardon
the
telling
of
a
serviceable
lie
or
the
perpetration
of
an
occasional
barbarism
in
speech
by
patricia
for
he
a
musgrave
of
matocton
had
married
a
stapylton
he
had
begun
to
comprehend
that
their
standards
were
different
and
that
some
daily
conflict
between
these
standards
was
inevitable
and
besides
as
it
has
been
veraciously
observed
the
truth
of
an
insult
is
the
barb
which
prevents
its
retraction
patricia
spoke
the
truth
rudolph
musgrave
and
all
those
rationally
reliant
upon
rudolph
musgrave
for
support
had
lived
for
some
five
years
upon
the
money
which
they
owed
to
patricia
he
saw
about
him
other
scions
of
old
families
who
accepted
such
circumstances
blithely
but
he
said
he
was
a
musgrave
of
matocton
and
he
reflected
in
the
kingdom
of
the
blind
the
is
necessarily
very
unhappy
he
did
not
mean
to
touch
a
penny
of
such
moneys
as
roger
stapylton
had
bequeathed
to
him
for
the
colonel
considered
now
it
was
a
man
duty
personally
to
support
his
wife
and
child
and
sister
and
he
vigorously
attempted
to
discharge
this
obligation
alike
by
virtue
of
his
salary
at
the
library
and
by
spasmodic
raids
upon
his
tiny
capital
and
chief
of
all
by
speculation
in
the
stock
market
oddly
enough
his
ventures
were
through
a
long
while
for
the
most
part
successful
here
he
builded
a
desperate
edifice
whose
foundations
were
his
social
talents
and
it
was
with
quaint
he
often
noted
how
the
telling
of
a
smutty
jest
or
the
insistence
upon
a
manifestly
superfluous
glass
of
wine
had
purchased
from
some
properly
tickled
magnate
a
much
desiderated
tip
and
presently
these
tips
misled
him
so
the
colonel
borrowed
from
patricia
account
and
on
this
occasion
he
guessed
correctly
and
then
he
stumbled
upon
such
a
chance
for
reinvestment
as
does
not
often
arrive
and
so
he
borrowed
a
trifle
more
in
common
justice
to
patricia
viii
when
those
then
famous
warriors
colonel
gaynor
and
captain
green
were
obstinately
fighting
extradition
in
quebec
when
in
washington
the
senate
was
wording
a
suitable
resolution
wherewith
to
congratulate
cuba
upon
that
island
independence
and
when
messieurs
fitzsimmons
and
jeffries
were
making
amicable
arrangements
in
san
francisco
to
fight
for
the
world
championship
at
this
remote
time
in
chicago
on
the
same
day
indeed
that
in
this
very
city
gross
was
legally
declared
the
author
of
a
play
called
cyrano
de
bergerac
the
sons
of
the
colonial
governors
opened
their
tenth
biennial
convention
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
colonel
rudolph
musgrave
represented
the
lichfield
chapter
it
was
two
days
later
the
telegram
arrived
it
read
very
ill
come
to
me
roger
in
perfect
patricia
he
noted
how
with
stapyltonian
thrift
patricia
telegraphed
ten
words
precisely
and
when
he
had
reached
home
late
in
the
evening
the
colonel
not
having
taken
his
bunch
of
keys
with
him
laid
down
his
case
on
the
dark
porch
and
reached
out
one
hand
to
the
he
found
it
muffled
with
some
flimsy
gritty
fabric
he
did
not
ring
upon
the
porch
was
a
rustic
bench
he
sat
upon
it
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
precisely
where
he
had
first
talked
with
agatha
about
first
coming
to
lichfield
once
the
door
of
a
house
across
the
street
was
opened
with
a
widening
gush
of
amber
light
wherein
he
saw
three
women
fitting
wraps
about
them
one
of
them
was
adjusting
a
lace
scarf
above
her
hair
no
we
not
a
afraid
just
around
the
corner
you
know
a
pleasant
evening
their
voices
carried
far
in
the
still
night
rudolph
musgrave
was
not
thinking
of
anything
presently
he
went
around
through
the
side
entrance
and
thus
came
into
the
kitchen
where
the
old
mulattress
virginia
was
sitting
alone
the
room
was
very
hot
in
agatha
time
supper
would
have
been
cooked
upon
the
in
the
cellar
he
reflected
virginia
had
risen
and
made
as
though
to
take
his
case
her
pleasant
yellow
face
as
imperturbable
as
an
idol
no
do
bother
virginia
said
colonel
musgrave
he
met
patricia
in
the
on
her
way
to
the
kitchen
she
had
not
chosen
as
even
the
most
sensible
of
us
will
instinctively
decline
to
do
to
vex
the
quiet
of
a
house
wherein
death
was
by
ringing
a
bell
holding
his
hand
in
hers
fondling
it
as
she
talked
patricia
told
how
three
nights
before
miss
agatha
had
been
queer
you
know
at
supper
patricia
had
not
liked
to
leave
her
but
it
was
the
night
of
the
club
second
whist
tournament
and
virginia
had
promised
to
watch
miss
agatha
and
anyhow
miss
agatha
had
gone
to
bed
before
patricia
left
the
house
and
would
have
thought
she
was
going
to
sleep
all
night
and
in
fine
patricia
return
at
a
drizzling
eleven
had
found
miss
agatha
sitting
in
the
garden
in
her
only
weeping
over
fancied
grievances
and
virginia
asleep
in
the
kitchen
and
agatha
had
died
that
afternoon
of
pneumonia
even
in
the
last
she
was
asking
always
when
would
rudolph
come
patricia
told
him
rudolph
musgrave
did
not
say
anything
without
any
apparent
emotion
he
put
patricia
aside
much
as
he
did
the
case
which
he
had
forgotten
to
lay
down
until
patricia
had
ended
her
recital
he
went
upstairs
to
the
front
room
patricia
bedroom
patricia
followed
him
agatha
body
lay
upon
the
bed
with
a
sheet
over
all
the
skill
had
arranged
everything
with
smug
and
horrible
tranquillity
rudolph
musgrave
remembered
he
was
years
old
and
when
in
all
these
years
had
there
been
a
moment
when
agatha
the
real
agatha
had
not
known
that
what
he
had
done
was
correct
because
otherwise
rudolph
would
not
have
done
it
i
trust
you
enjoyed
your
patricia
well
i
could
help
it
i
not
running
a
sanitarium
i
responsible
for
her
eternal
drinking
the
words
skipped
out
of
either
mouth
like
gleeful
little
devils
then
both
were
afraid
and
both
were
as
icily
tranquil
as
the
thing
upon
the
bed
you
could
not
hear
anything
except
the
clock
upon
the
mantel
colonel
musgrave
went
to
the
mantel
opened
the
clock
and
with
an
odd
deliberation
removed
the
pendulum
from
its
hook
followed
one
metallic
gasp
as
of
indignation
and
then
silence
he
spoke
still
staring
at
the
clock
his
back
turned
to
patricia
you
must
be
utterly
worn
out
you
had
better
go
to
bed
he
shifted
by
the
fraction
of
an
inch
the
daguerreotype
of
his
father
in
confederate
uniform
please
do
wear
that
black
dress
again
it
is
no
cause
for
mourning
that
we
are
rid
of
an
encumbrance
behind
him
very
far
away
it
seemed
he
heard
patricia
wailing
olaf
colonel
musgrave
turned
without
any
haste
please
go
he
said
and
appeared
to
plead
with
her
you
must
be
frightfully
tired
i
am
sorry
that
i
was
not
here
i
seem
always
to
evade
my
responsibilities
somehow
then
he
began
to
laugh
it
rather
amusing
after
all
agatha
was
the
most
noble
person
i
have
ever
known
the
this
habit
of
hers
to
which
you
have
alluded
was
not
a
part
of
her
and
i
loved
agatha
and
i
suppose
loving
is
not
altogether
dependent
upon
logic
in
any
event
i
loved
agatha
and
when
i
came
back
to
her
i
had
come
home
somehow
wherever
she
might
be
at
the
time
that
has
been
true
oh
ever
since
i
can
remember
he
touched
the
dead
hand
now
please
go
he
said
and
he
did
not
look
toward
patricia
for
agatha
loved
me
better
than
she
did
god
you
know
the
curse
was
born
in
her
she
had
to
pay
for
what
those
dead
musgraves
did
that
is
why
her
hands
are
so
cold
now
she
had
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
being
a
musgrave
you
see
but
then
we
can
not
always
pick
and
choose
as
to
what
we
prefer
to
be
oh
yes
of
course
it
is
all
my
fault
everything
is
my
fault
but
god
knows
what
would
have
become
of
you
and
your
agatha
if
it
had
been
for
me
oh
oh
patricia
wailed
i
was
a
child
and
i
had
any
better
sense
and
i
married
you
and
you
been
living
off
my
money
ever
since
there
has
been
a
christmas
present
or
a
funeral
wreath
bought
in
this
house
since
i
came
into
it
i
did
pick
out
and
pay
for
out
of
my
own
pocket
and
all
the
thanks
i
get
for
it
is
this
perpetual
and
i
wish
i
was
dead
like
this
poor
saint
here
she
spent
her
life
slaving
for
you
and
what
thanks
did
she
get
for
it
oh
you
ought
to
go
down
on
your
knees
rudolph
musgrave
please
leave
he
said
i
will
leave
when
i
feel
like
it
and
not
a
single
minute
before
and
you
might
just
as
well
understand
as
much
you
been
living
off
my
money
oh
you
need
go
to
the
trouble
of
lying
and
she
did
too
and
she
hated
me
she
always
hated
me
because
i
had
been
fool
enough
to
marry
you
and
she
carried
on
like
a
lunatic
more
than
half
the
time
and
i
always
pretended
not
to
notice
it
and
this
is
my
reward
for
trying
to
behave
like
a
lady
patricia
tossed
her
head
yes
and
you
need
look
at
me
as
if
i
were
some
sort
of
a
bug
you
had
ever
seen
before
and
did
approve
of
because
i
seen
you
try
that
trick
too
often
for
it
to
work
with
me
patricia
stood
now
beneath
the
stuart
portrait
of
young
gerald
musgrave
she
had
insisted
long
ago
that
it
be
hung
in
her
own
bedroom
because
it
was
through
that
beautiful
boy
we
first
got
really
acquainted
olaf
the
boy
smiles
at
you
from
the
canvas
smiles
ambiguously
as
the
colonel
now
noted
i
think
you
had
better
go
said
colonel
musgrave
please
go
patricia
before
i
murder
you
she
saw
that
he
was
speaking
in
perfect
earnest
ix
rudolph
musgrave
sat
all
night
beside
the
body
he
had
declined
to
speak
with
innumerable
sympathetic
cousins
vartreys
and
fentons
and
allardyces
and
musgraves
to
the
fifth
and
sixth
remove
who
had
come
from
all
quarters
with
and
requests
to
be
informed
if
there
is
anything
we
can
possibly
do
rudolph
musgrave
sat
all
night
beside
the
body
he
had
not
any
strength
for
anger
now
and
hardly
for
grief
agatha
had
been
his
charge
and
the
fact
that
he
had
never
plucked
up
courage
to
allude
to
her
practises
was
now
an
enormity
in
which
he
could
not
quite
believe
his
cowardice
and
its
fruitage
confronted
him
and
frightened
him
into
a
panic
frenzy
of
remorse
agatha
had
been
his
charge
and
he
had
entrusted
the
stewardship
to
patricia
between
them
that
patricia
might
have
her
that
he
might
sit
upon
a
platform
for
an
hour
or
two
with
a
other
pompous
fools
they
had
let
agatha
die
there
was
no
mercy
in
him
for
patricia
or
for
himself
he
wished
patricia
had
been
a
man
had
any
man
an
emperor
or
a
it
would
not
have
mattered
spoken
as
patricia
had
done
within
the
moment
here
within
arm
reach
of
the
poor
flesh
that
had
been
agatha
rudolph
musgrave
would
have
known
his
duty
but
according
to
his
code
it
was
not
permitted
to
be
discourteous
to
a
woman
he
caught
himself
with
grotesque
meanness
wishing
that
agatha
had
been
there
privileged
by
her
sex
where
he
was
fettered
she
who
was
so
generous
of
heart
and
so
fiery
of
tongue
at
need
and
comprehension
that
agatha
would
never
abet
or
adore
him
any
more
smote
him
anew
and
chance
reserved
for
him
more
poignant
torture
next
day
while
rudolph
musgrave
was
making
out
the
list
of
honorary
the
postman
brought
a
letter
which
had
been
forwarded
from
chicago
it
was
from
agatha
written
upon
the
morning
of
that
day
wherein
later
she
had
been
as
patricia
phrased
it
queer
you
know
he
found
it
wildly
droll
to
puzzle
out
those
crossed
four
sheets
of
trivialities
written
in
an
italian
hand
so
minute
and
orderly
that
the
finished
page
suggested
a
he
had
so
often
remonstrated
with
agatha
about
her
penuriousness
as
concerned
stationery
selina
brice
the
rev
henry
anstruther
who
now
has
a
church
in
seattle
have
announced
their
engagement
stanley
haggage
has
gone
to
alabama
to
marry
leonora
bright
who
moved
from
here
a
year
ago
they
are
both
as
poor
as
church
mice
i
think
marriage
in
such
a
case
an
unwise
step
for
anyone
it
brings
cares
anxieties
enough
any
way
without
starting
out
with
poverty
to
increase
and
render
deeper
every
trouble
such
was
the
tenor
of
agatha
last
letter
of
the
last
of
that
effigy
upstairs
who
you
could
see
knew
everything
and
was
not
discontent
here
the
dead
spoke
omniscient
and
told
you
that
stanley
haggage
had
gone
to
alabama
and
that
marriage
brought
new
cares
and
anxieties
i
can
not
laugh
said
rudolph
musgrave
aloud
i
know
the
jest
deserves
it
but
i
can
not
laugh
because
my
upper
lip
seems
to
be
made
of
leather
and
i
ca
move
it
and
besides
i
loved
agatha
to
a
degree
which
only
you
and
i
have
ever
known
of
she
never
understood
quite
how
i
loved
her
oh
wo
you
make
her
understand
just
how
i
loved
her
for
agatha
is
dead
because
you
wanted
her
to
be
dead
and
i
have
never
told
her
how
much
i
loved
her
and
now
i
can
not
ever
tell
her
how
much
i
loved
her
oh
wo
you
please
show
me
that
you
have
made
her
understand
or
else
have
me
struck
by
lightning
or
do
nothing
was
done
x
and
afterward
rudolph
musgrave
and
his
wife
met
amicably
and
without
reference
to
their
last
talk
patricia
wore
for
some
six
months
and
colonel
musgrave
accepted
the
compromise
tacitly
all
passed
with
perfect
smoothness
between
them
and
anyone
in
lichfield
would
have
told
you
that
the
musgraves
were
a
model
couple
she
called
him
rudolph
now
olaf
is
such
a
nickname
for
two
old
married
people
you
know
patricia
estimated
the
colonel
negligently
said
that
he
supposed
it
did
sound
odd
only
i
do
think
clarice
pendomer
would
care
about
coming
he
resumed
for
the
two
were
discussing
an
uncompleted
list
of
the
people
patricia
was
to
invite
to
their
first
and
for
heaven
sake
why
not
we
always
have
her
to
everything
he
could
not
tell
her
it
was
because
the
charterises
were
to
be
among
their
guests
so
he
said
oh
well
pendomer
then
patricia
wrote
the
name
with
a
flourish
oh
you
i
not
jealous
everybody
knows
you
never
had
any
more
morals
than
a
on
the
back
fence
it
a
lucky
thing
the
boy
did
take
after
you
is
it
he
does
not
a
bit
no
harry
pendomer
is
the
puniest
little
wretch
whereas
your
other
son
sir
resembles
his
mother
and
is
in
consequence
a
ravishingly
beautiful
person
of
superlative
charm
he
was
staring
at
her
so
oddly
that
she
paused
so
patricia
was
familiar
with
that
old
scandal
which
linked
his
name
with
clarice
pendomer
he
was
wondering
if
patricia
had
married
him
in
the
belief
that
she
was
marrying
a
man
who
appraised
by
any
standards
had
acted
infamously
i
was
only
thinking
you
had
better
ask
judge
allardyce
patricia
you
see
he
is
absolutely
certain
not
to
come
this
year
the
musgraves
had
decided
not
to
spend
the
spring
alone
together
at
matocton
as
they
had
done
the
four
preceding
years
it
looks
so
silly
as
patricia
pointed
out
and
besides
a
is
the
most
economical
method
as
she
also
pointed
out
being
born
a
stapylton
of
paying
off
your
social
obligations
because
you
can
always
ask
so
many
people
who
you
know
have
made
other
plans
and
can
not
accept
so
we
will
invite
judge
allardyce
of
course
said
patricia
i
had
forgotten
his
court
met
in
june
oh
and
peter
blagden
too
it
had
slipped
my
mind
his
uncle
was
dead
i
learned
this
morning
haggage
was
to
lecture
in
louisville
on
the
sixteenth
she
was
reading
up
in
the
library
you
see
rudolph
you
are
the
lodestar
of
my
existence
i
will
ask
her
to
come
on
the
fourteenth
and
spend
a
week
i
never
could
abide
the
hag
but
she
has
such
a
there
i
made
a
big
blot
right
in
the
middle
of
and
spoiled
a
perfectly
good
sheet
of
paper
you
better
mail
it
at
once
though
because
the
may
have
something
in
it
about
her
lecture
xi
rudolph
why
er
yes
dear
this
was
after
supper
and
patricia
was
playing
solitaire
her
husband
was
reading
the
paper
agatha
told
me
all
about
virginia
you
know
here
colonel
musgrave
frowned
it
is
not
a
pleasant
topic
you
you
behave
entirely
too
much
as
if
you
were
my
grandfather
as
i
was
saying
agatha
told
me
all
about
your
uncle
and
virginia
patricia
hurried
on
and
how
she
ran
away
afterwards
and
hid
in
the
woods
for
three
days
and
came
to
your
father
plantation
and
how
your
father
bought
her
and
how
her
son
was
born
and
how
her
son
was
lynched
now
really
patricia
surely
there
are
other
matters
which
may
be
more
profitably
discussed
of
course
now
for
instance
why
is
the
king
of
hearts
the
only
one
that
has
a
moustache
patricia
peeped
to
see
what
cards
lay
beneath
that
monarch
and
upon
reflection
moved
the
king
of
spades
into
the
vacant
space
she
was
a
devotee
of
solitaire
and
invariably
cheated
at
it
she
went
on
absently
but
do
you
see
that
colored
boy
was
your
own
first
cousin
and
he
was
killed
for
doing
exactly
what
his
father
had
done
only
they
sent
the
father
to
the
senate
and
gave
him
columns
of
flubdub
and
laid
him
out
in
state
when
he
died
and
they
poured
kerosene
upon
the
son
and
burned
him
alive
and
i
believe
virginia
thinks
that
was
fair
what
do
you
mean
i
honestly
believe
virginia
hates
the
musgraves
she
is
only
a
negro
of
course
but
then
she
was
a
mother
once
oh
yes
all
i
need
is
a
black
eight
patricia
demanded
now
look
at
your
brother
hector
the
awfully
dissipated
one
that
died
of
an
overdose
of
opiates
when
it
happened
was
virginia
taking
care
of
him
of
course
she
is
an
invaluable
nurse
and
nobody
else
was
here
when
agatha
went
out
into
the
rain
now
what
if
she
had
just
let
agatha
go
without
trying
to
stop
her
it
would
have
been
perfectly
simple
so
is
this
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
take
them
off
now
colonel
musgrave
negligently
returned
to
his
perusal
of
the
afternoon
paper
you
are
suggesting
if
you
will
overlook
my
frankness
the
most
deplorable
sort
of
nonsense
patricia
i
know
exactly
how
balaam
felt
she
said
irrelevantly
and
fell
to
shuffling
the
cards
you
do
and
you
wo
understand
that
virginia
is
a
human
being
in
any
event
i
wish
you
would
get
rid
of
her
i
could
decently
do
that
said
rudolph
musgrave
with
careful
patience
virginia
faithfulness
has
been
proven
by
too
many
years
of
faithful
service
nothing
more
strikingly
attests
the
folly
of
freeing
the
negro
than
the
unwillingness
of
the
better
class
of
slaves
to
leave
their
former
owners
now
you
are
going
to
quote
a
paragraph
or
so
from
your
gracious
era
as
if
i
had
read
everything
you
ever
wrote
you
are
a
fearful
humbug
in
some
ways
rudolph
and
you
are
a
rattlepate
madam
but
seriously
patricia
you
who
were
reared
in
the
north
are
strangely
unwilling
to
concede
that
we
of
the
south
are
after
all
best
qualified
to
deal
with
the
negro
problem
we
know
the
negro
as
you
can
not
ever
know
him
you
oh
god
ha
mercy
on
us
mocked
patricia
there
was
any
negro
problem
hereabouts
you
beautiful
idiot
so
long
as
there
were
any
negroes
why
there
is
hardly
one
negro
in
lichfield
there
are
only
a
thousand
or
so
of
mulattoes
who
share
the
blood
of
people
like
your
uncle
edward
and
for
the
most
part
they
take
after
their
white
kin
unfortunately
and
there
you
have
the
lichfield
negro
problem
in
a
nutshell
it
is
a
venerable
one
and
fully
set
forth
in
the
bible
you
need
attempt
to
argue
with
me
because
you
are
a
ninnyhammer
and
i
am
a
second
nestor
the
holy
scriptures
are
perfectly
explicit
as
to
what
happens
to
the
heads
of
the
children
and
their
teeth
too
i
wish
you
would
jest
about
such
matters
because
it
is
but
rudolph
you
know
perfectly
well
that
i
am
not
a
lady
my
dear
he
cried
in
horror
that
was
real
and
what
on
earth
have
i
said
even
to
suggest
oh
not
a
syllable
it
is
at
all
the
sort
of
thing
that
your
sort
and
i
am
not
your
sort
i
do
know
that
i
altogether
wish
i
were
but
i
were
it
would
certainly
make
things
easier
patricia
added
sharply
my
dear
he
again
protested
now
candidly
rudolph
relinquishing
the
game
she
fell
to
shuffling
the
cards
just
count
up
the
number
of
times
this
month
that
my
oh
well
i
really
do
know
what
to
call
it
except
my
deplorable
omission
in
failing
to
be
born
a
lady
has
seemed
to
you
to
yank
the
very
last
rag
off
the
he
scoffed
what
nonsense
although
of
course
patricia
she
nodded
mischief
in
her
tiny
face
yes
that
is
just
your
attitude
you
beautiful
idiot
although
of
course
now
quite
honestly
patricia
i
have
occasionally
wished
that
you
would
not
speak
of
sacred
and
er
physical
and
sociological
matters
in
exactly
the
tone
in
which
well
in
which
you
sometimes
do
speak
of
them
it
may
sound
but
i
have
always
believed
that
decency
is
quite
as
important
in
mental
affairs
as
it
is
in
physical
ones
and
that
as
a
consequence
a
gentlewoman
should
always
clothe
her
thoughts
with
at
least
the
same
care
she
accords
her
body
oh
do
misunderstand
me
of
course
it
does
do
any
harm
my
dear
between
us
but
outside
you
see
for
people
to
know
that
you
think
about
such
things
must
necessarily
give
them
a
false
opinion
of
you
patricia
meditated
she
said
with
utter
solemnity
anathema
maranatha
oh
hell
to
damn
may
the
noses
of
all
respectable
people
be
turned
upside
down
and
jackasses
dance
eternally
upon
their
grandmothers
graves
patricia
cried
a
shocked
colonel
i
mean
every
syllable
of
it
no
rudolph
ca
help
it
if
the
vinaigretted
beauties
of
your
boyhood
were
unabridged
dictionaries
of
prudery
you
see
i
know
almost
all
the
swearwords
there
are
and
i
read
the
newspapers
and
medical
books
and
even
the
things
that
boys
chalk
up
on
fences
in
consequence
i
am
not
a
bit
whiteminded
because
if
you
use
your
mind
at
all
it
gets
more
or
less
dingy
just
like
using
anything
else
he
could
not
help
but
laugh
much
as
he
disapproved
patricia
fluttered
and
as
a
wren
might
have
done
perched
presently
upon
his
knee
rudolph
ca
you
laugh
more
often
and
not
devote
so
much
time
to
tracing
out
the
genealogies
of
those
silly
people
and
being
so
tediously
beautiful
and
good
she
asked
and
with
a
hint
of
seriousness
rudolph
you
do
know
how
i
would
adore
you
if
you
would
rob
a
church
or
cut
somebody
throat
in
an
alley
and
tell
me
all
about
it
because
you
knew
i
would
betray
you
you
are
so
infernally
respectable
in
everything
you
do
how
did
you
come
to
bully
me
that
day
at
the
library
it
seems
almost
as
if
those
two
were
different
people
does
it
rudolph
my
dear
the
colonel
said
whimsically
i
am
afraid
we
are
rather
like
the
shepherdess
and
the
of
the
fable
i
read
you
very
long
ago
we
climbed
up
so
far
that
we
could
see
the
stars
once
very
long
ago
patricia
and
we
have
come
back
to
live
upon
the
parlor
table
i
suppose
it
happens
to
all
the
little
china
people
she
took
his
meaning
each
was
aware
of
an
odd
sense
of
intimacy
everything
we
have
to
be
glad
for
now
rudolph
is
the
rivet
in
grandfather
neck
it
is
rather
a
fiasco
is
it
eh
there
are
all
sorts
of
rivets
patricia
and
the
thing
one
can
not
do
because
one
is
what
one
is
need
not
be
necessarily
a
cause
for
grief
xii
it
was
excellent
to
see
jack
charteris
again
as
colonel
musgrave
did
within
a
few
days
of
this
musgrave
was
unreasonably
fond
of
the
novelist
and
frankly
confessed
it
would
be
as
preposterous
to
connect
charteris
with
any
of
the
accepted
standards
of
morality
as
it
would
be
to
judge
an
from
the
standpoint
of
ethics
anne
was
not
yet
in
lichfield
she
had
broken
the
journey
to
visit
a
maternal
and
some
virginia
cousins
in
richmond
charteris
explained
and
was
to
come
thence
to
matocton
and
so
you
have
acquired
a
boy
and
by
my
soul
a
very
handsome
wife
rudolph
it
is
sufficiently
notorious
said
colonel
musgrave
yes
we
are
quite
absurdly
happy
he
laughed
and
added
patricia
but
you
know
her
droll
way
of
putting
things
says
that
the
only
rational
complaint
i
can
advance
against
her
is
her
habit
of
rushing
into
a
hospital
every
month
or
so
and
having
a
section
or
two
of
her
person
removed
by
surgeons
it
worries
me
only
of
course
it
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
can
talk
about
and
as
patricia
says
it
an
unpleasant
thing
to
realize
that
your
wife
is
not
leaving
you
through
the
ordinary
channels
of
death
or
of
decrees
of
the
court
but
only
in
vulgar
fractions
as
it
were
please
do
be
quite
so
brutal
rudolph
it
is
not
becoming
in
a
musgrave
of
matocton
to
speak
of
women
in
any
tone
other
than
the
most
honeyed
accents
of
chivalry
oh
i
was
only
quoting
patricia
the
colonel
largely
said
and
er
jack
he
continued
by
the
way
jack
clarice
pendomer
will
be
at
matocton
i
rejoice
in
her
good
luck
said
charteris
and
well
i
was
wondering
i
can
assure
you
that
there
will
be
no
trouble
that
skeleton
is
safely
locked
in
its
closet
and
the
key
to
that
closet
is
missing
more
thanks
to
you
you
acted
very
nobly
in
the
whole
affair
rudolph
i
wish
i
could
do
things
like
that
as
it
is
of
course
i
shall
always
detest
you
for
having
been
able
to
do
it
charteris
said
thereafter
i
shall
always
envy
you
though
rudolph
no
other
man
i
know
has
ever
attained
the
good
old
troubadourish
ideal
of
that
love
which
rather
abhors
than
otherwise
the
notion
of
possessing
its
object
i
still
believe
it
was
a
distinct
relief
to
a
certain
military
officer
whose
name
we
need
not
mention
when
anne
decided
not
to
marry
you
the
colonel
grinned
a
trifle
consciously
well
anne
meant
youth
you
comprehend
and
all
the
things
we
then
believed
in
jack
it
would
have
been
decidedly
difficult
to
live
up
to
such
a
contract
and
as
it
were
to
fulfil
every
one
of
the
implied
specifications
and
yet
here
charteris
flicked
his
cigarette
anne
ruled
in
the
stead
of
aline
van
orden
and
aline
in
turn
had
followed
clarice
pendomer
and
before
the
coming
of
clarice
had
pauline
romeyne
whom
time
has
converted
into
polly
ashmeade
reigned
in
the
land
do
be
an
ass
the
colonel
pleaded
and
then
observed
inconsequently
i
ca
somehow
quite
realize
aline
is
dead
lord
lord
the
letters
that
i
wrote
to
her
she
sent
them
all
back
you
know
in
genuine
romantic
fashion
after
we
had
quarreled
i
found
those
boyish
ravings
only
the
other
day
in
my
father
desk
at
matocton
and
skimmed
them
over
i
shall
read
them
through
some
day
and
appropriately
meditate
over
life
mysteries
that
are
too
sad
for
tears
he
meditated
now
it
would
be
quite
equitable
jack
the
colonel
summed
it
up
if
the
aline
i
loved
no
i
do
mean
the
real
woman
the
one
you
and
all
the
other
people
knew
the
one
that
married
the
enterprising
brewer
and
died
five
years
ago
were
not
waiting
for
me
somewhere
i
ca
express
just
what
i
mean
but
you
will
understand
i
know
that
heaven
is
necessarily
run
on
a
mohammedan
basis
why
of
course
said
charteris
heaven
as
i
apprehend
it
is
a
place
where
we
shall
live
eternally
among
those
ladies
of
old
years
who
never
condescended
actually
to
inhabit
any
realm
more
tangible
than
that
of
our
boyish
fancies
it
is
the
obvious
definition
and
i
defy
you
to
evolve
a
more
enticing
allurement
toward
becoming
a
deacon
you
romancers
are
privileged
to
talk
nonsense
anywhere
the
colonel
estimated
and
i
suppose
that
in
the
lichfield
you
have
made
famous
jack
you
have
a
double
right
ah
but
i
never
wrote
a
line
concerning
lichfield
i
only
wrote
about
the
lichfield
whose
existence
you
continue
to
believe
in
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
you
are
actually
living
in
the
real
lichfield
charteris
returned
the
vitality
of
the
legend
is
wonderful
he
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
an
habitual
gesture
with
charteris
and
the
colonel
noted
as
he
had
often
done
before
how
extraordinarily
reminiscent
jack
was
of
a
quizzical
black
parrot
said
charteris
i
love
to
serve
that
legend
i
love
to
prattle
of
marster
and
miss
and
throw
in
a
sprinkling
of
and
and
time
and
of
sweeping
animadversions
as
to
all
niggers
and
to
narrate
how
quality
use
ter
cum
you
spell
it
because
that
looks
so
convincingly
like
dialect
de
gret
hous
those
are
the
main
ingredients
and
as
for
the
unavoidable
charteris
paused
grinned
and
pleasantly
resumed
why
jes
arter
dat
suh
a
hut
yankee
whar
some
uv
our
folks
done
shoot
in

laig
wuz

notorious
custom

and
there
you
are
i
need
not
mention
that
during
the
tale
progress
it
is
necessary
to
introduce
at
least
one
favorable
mention
of
lincoln
arrange
a
duel
de
low
immediately
after
and
have
the
family
silver
interred
in
the
back
garden
because
these
points
will
naturally
suggest
themselves
jack
jack
the
colonel
cried
it
is
an
ill
bird
that
fouls
its
own
nest
but
believe
me
i
do
at
heart
said
charteris
in
a
queer
earnest
voice
there
is
a
sardonic
imp
inside
me
that
makes
me
jeer
at
the
commoner
tricks
of
the
trade
and
yet
when
i
am
practising
that
trade
when
i
am
writing
of
those
brave
and
gracious
men
and
women
and
of
those
dear
old
darkies
i
very
often
write
with
tears
in
my
eyes
i
tell
you
this
with
careful
airiness
because
it
is
true
and
because
it
would
embarrass
me
so
horribly
if
you
believed
it
then
he
was
off
upon
another
tack
and
wherein
pray
have
i
harmed
lichfield
by
imagining
a
dream
city
situated
half
way
between
atlantis
and
avalon
and
peopled
with
superhuman
persons
and
by
having
called
this
city
lichfield
the
portrait
did
not
only
flatter
lichfield
it
flattered
human
nature
so
naturally
it
pleased
everybody
yes
that
i
take
it
is
the
true
secret
of
romance
to
induce
the
momentary
delusion
that
humanity
is
a
superhuman
race
profuse
in
aspiration
and
prodigal
in
the
exercise
of
glorious
virtues
and
stupendous
vices
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
human
passions
are
depressingly
i
find
were
it
not
for
the
police
court
records
i
would
pessimistically
insist
that
all
of
us
elect
to
love
one
person
and
to
hate
another
with
very
much
the
same
enthusiasm
that
we
display
in
expressing
a
preference
for
rare
roast
beef
as
compared
with
the
outside
slice
oh
really
rudolph
you
have
no
notion
how
salutary
it
is
to
the
of
us
romanticists
to
run
across
even
nowadays
an
occasional
breach
of
the
peace
for
then
sometimes
when
the
coachman
obligingly
cuts
the
butler
throat
in
the
say
we
actually
presume
to
think
for
a
moment
that
our
profession
is
almost
as
honest
as
that
of
making
counterfeit
money
the
colonel
did
not
interrupt
his
brief
pause
of
meditation
then
the
novelist
said
why
no
if
i
were
ever
really
to
attempt
a
tale
of
lichfield
i
would
not
write
a
romance
but
a
tragedy
i
think
that
i
would
call
my
tragedy
for
it
would
mirror
the
life
of
lichfield
with
unengaging
candor
and
as
a
consequence
people
would
complain
that
my
tragedy
lacked
sustained
interest
and
that
its
participants
were
inconsistent
that
it
had
no
ordered
plot
no
startling
incidents
no
high
endeavors
and
no
especial
aim
and
that
it
was
equally
deficient
in
all
provocatives
of
either
laughter
or
tears
for
very
few
people
would
understand
that
a
life
such
as
this
when
rightly
viewed
is
the
most
pathetic
tragedy
conceivable
oh
come
now
jack
come
recollect
that
your
reasoning
powers
are
almost
as
worthy
of
employment
as
your
rhetorical
abilities
we
are
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
you
know
we
may
be
a
little
behind
the
times
in
lichfield
we
certainly
let
well
enough
alone
and
we
take
things
pretty
much
as
they
come
but
we
meddle
with
nobody
and
after
all
we
do
any
especial
harm
we
do
do
anything
whatever
in
especial
rudolph
that
would
be
precisely
the
theme
of
my
story
of
the
real
lichfield
if
i
were
ever
bold
enough
to
write
it
there
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
blight
upon
lichfield
oh
yes
it
would
be
unfair
perhaps
to
contrast
it
with
the
bigger
southern
cities
like
richmond
and
atlanta
and
new
orleans
but
even
the
inhabitants
of
smaller
southern
towns
are
beginning
to
buy
excursion
tickets
and
thereby
ascertain
that
the
twentieth
century
has
really
begun
yes
it
is
only
in
lichfield
i
can
detect
the
raw
stuff
of
a
genuine
tragedy
for
depend
upon
it
rudolph
the
most
pathetic
tragedy
in
life
is
to
get
nothing
in
particular
out
of
it
but
for
my
part
i
do
see
what
you
are
driving
at
the
colonel
stoutly
said
and
charteris
only
laughed
and
i
hardly
expected
you
to
do
so
rudolph
or
not
yet
at
least
part
five
souvenir
i
am
contented
by
remembrances
dreams
of
dead
passions
wraiths
of
vanished
times
fragments
of
vows
and
of
old
rhymes
flotsam
and
jetsam
tumbling
in
the
seas
whereon
long
since
put
forth
our
argosies
which
bent
on
traffic
in
the
isles
of
love
lie
foundered
somewhere
in
some
firth
thereof
encradled
by
eternal
silences
thus
having
come
to
naked
bankruptcy
let
us
part
friends
as
thrifty
tradesmen
do
when
common
ventures
fail
for
it
may
be
these
battered
oaths
and
rhymes
may
yet
ring
true
to
some
fair
woman
hearing
so
that
she
will
listen
and
think
of
love
and
i
of
you
ashcroft
wheeler
i
when
the
the
and
the
were
holding
trial
races
off
newport
to
decide
which
one
of
these
yachts
should
defend
the
cup
when
the
tone
of
the
japanese
press
as
to
russia
actions
in
manchuria
was
beginning
to
grow
ominous
when
the
jews
of
america
were
drafting
a
petition
to
the
czar
and
when
it
was
rumored
that
the
health
of
pope
leo
xiii
was
commencing
to
fail
at
this
remote
time
the
musgraves
gave
their
first
and
at
this
period
colonel
musgrave
noted
and
admired
the
apparent
unconcern
with
which
john
charteris
and
clarice
pendomer
encountered
at
matocton
and
at
this
period
colonel
musgrave
noted
with
approval
the
intimacy
which
was
obviously
flourishing
between
the
little
novelist
and
patricia
also
colonel
musgrave
had
presently
good
reason
to
lament
a
contretemps
over
which
he
was
sulking
when
pendomer
rustled
to
her
seat
at
the
with
a
shortness
of
breath
that
was
partly
due
to
the
stairs
and
in
part
attributable
to
her
youthful
dress
which
fitted
a
trifle
too
perfectly
waffles
said
pendomer
at
my
age
and
weight
the
first
is
an
experiment
and
the
fifth
an
amiable
indiscretion
of
which
i
am
invariably
guilty
sugar
please
she
yawned
and
reached
a
arm
toward
the
yes
that
will
do
pilkins
colonel
musgrave
since
the
remainder
of
his
had
already
breakfasted
raised
his
fine
eyes
toward
the
chandelier
and
sighed
as
pilkins
demurely
closed
the
door
leander
pilkins
butler
for
a
long
while
now
to
the
musgraves
of
matocton
would
here
if
space
permitted
be
the
subject
of
an
encomium
leander
pilkins
was
in
lichfield
considered
to
be
upon
the
whole
the
handsomest
man
whom
lichfield
had
produced
for
this
quadroon
skin
was
like
old
ivory
and
his
profile
would
have
done
credit
to
an
emperor
his
terrapin
is
still
spoken
of
in
lichfield
as
people
in
less
favored
localities
speak
of
the
golden
age
and
his
mayonnaise
boasts
lichfield
would
have
compelled
an
olympian
to
plead
for
a
second
helping
for
the
rest
his
deportment
in
all
functions
of
butlership
is
best
described
as
and
indeed
he
was
generally
known
to
be
a
byblow
of
captain
beverley
musgrave
who
in
his
day
was
lichfield
arbiter
as
touched
the
social
graces
and
so
no
more
of
pilkins
pendomer
partook
of
chops
is
this
remorse
she
queried
or
a
convivially
induced
requirement
for
bromides
at
this
unearthly
hour
of
the
morning
it
is
very
often
difficult
to
disentangle
the
two
it
is
neither
said
colonel
musgrave
and
almost
snappishly
followed
an
interval
of
silence
really
said
pendomer
and
as
with
sympathy
one
would
think
you
had
at
last
been
confronted
with
one
of
your
pasts
or
is
it
rudolph
colonel
musgrave
frowned
disapprovingly
at
her
frivolity
he
swallowed
his
coffee
and
buttered
a
superfluous
potato
h
said
he
then
you
know
i
know
sighed
she
that
a
sleeping
past
frequently
suffers
from
insomnia
and
in
that
case
said
he
darkly
it
is
not
the
only
sufferer
pendomer
considered
the
attractions
of
a
third
waffle
a
mellow
blending
of
autumnal
yellows
fringed
with
a
crisp
and
irresistible
brown
that
for
the
moment
put
to
flight
all
dreams
and
visions
of
slenderness
and
patricia
she
queried
with
a
mental
hiatus
colonel
musgrave
flushed
patricia
he
conceded
with
mingled
dignity
and
sadness
is
after
all
still
in
her
twenties
yes
said
pendomer
with
a
dryness
which
might
mean
anything
or
nothing
she
only
when
she
married
you
i
mean
he
explained
with
obvious
patience
that
at
her
age
she
not
unnaturally
takes
an
immature
view
of
things
her
unspoiled
purity
he
added
meditatively
and
innocence
and
general
unsophistication
are
of
course
adorable
but
i
can
admit
to
thinking
that
for
a
journey
through
life
they
impress
me
as
excess
baggage
patricia
said
pendomer
soothingly
has
ideals
and
ideals
like
a
or
a
mission
in
life
should
be
pitied
rather
than
condemned
when
our
friends
possess
them
especially
she
continued
buttering
her
waffle
as
so
many
women
have
them
sandwiched
between
their
last
attack
of
measles
and
their
first
imported
complexion
no
one
of
the
three
is
lasting
rudolph
h
said
he
there
was
another
silence
the
colonel
desperately
felt
that
matters
were
not
advancing
h
said
she
with
something
of
interrogation
in
her
voice
see
here
clarice
i
have
known
you
you
have
not
cried
she
very
earnestly
not
by
five
years
well
say
for
some
time
you
are
a
sensible
woman
a
man
pendomer
lamented
parenthetically
never
suspects
a
woman
of
discretion
until
she
begins
to
lose
her
waist
and
i
am
sure
that
i
can
rely
upon
your
womanly
tact
and
finer
instincts
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
to
help
me
out
of
a
deuce
of
a
mess
pendomer
ate
on
in
an
exceedingly
noncommittal
fashion
as
he
paused
inquiringly
she
has
been
reading
some
letters
said
he
at
length
some
letters
that
i
wrote
a
long
time
ago
in
the
case
of
so
young
a
girl
observed
pendomer
with
perfect
comprehension
i
should
have
undoubtedly
recommended
a
judicious
supervision
of
her
she
was
looking
through
an
old
escritoire
he
explained
jack
charteris
had
suggested
that
some
of
my
father
letters
during
the
war
you
know
might
be
of
value
he
paused
for
pendomer
appeared
on
the
verge
of
a
question
but
she
only
said
so
it
was
charteris
who
suggested
searching
the
desk
ah
yes
and
then
and
it
was
years
ago
and
just
the
usual
sort
of
thing
though
it
may
have
seemed
from
the
letters
why
i
had
given
the
girl
a
thought
he
cried
in
virtuous
indignation
until
patricia
found
the
letters
and
read
them
naturally
she
assented
yes
just
as
i
read
george
the
smile
with
which
she
accompanied
this
remark
suggested
that
both
pendomer
correspondence
and
home
life
were
at
times
of
an
interesting
nature
i
had
destroyed
the
envelopes
when
she
returned
them
continued
colonel
musgrave
with
morose
confusion
of
persons
patricia
even
know
who
the
girl
was
her
name
somehow
was
not
mentioned
of
my
heart
girl
in
all
the
world
quoted
pendomer
reminiscently
and
suchlike
tender
phrases
scattered
in
with
a
after
the
rough
copy
was
made
in
pencil
and
dated
just
or
of
course
ah
you
were
always
very
careful
rudolph
she
sighed
and
now
that
makes
it
all
the
worse
because
as
far
as
all
the
evidence
goes
these
letters
may
have
been
returned
yesterday
why
colonel
musgrave
pulled
up
short
hardly
seeing
his
way
clear
through
the
indignant
periods
on
which
he
had
entered
i
declined
said
he
somewhat
lamely
to
discuss
the
matter
with
her
in
her
present
excited
and
perfectly
unreasonable
condition
pendomer
penciled
eyebrows
rose
and
her
lips
which
were
quite
as
red
as
there
was
any
necessity
for
their
being
twitched
hysterics
she
asked
worse
groaned
colonel
musgrave
patient
resignation
under
unmerited
affliction
he
had
picked
up
a
teaspoon
and
he
carefully
balanced
it
upon
his
forefinger
there
were
certain
phrases
in
these
letters
which
were
somehow
repeated
in
certain
letters
i
wrote
to
patricia
the
summer
we
were
engaged
and
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
she
does
like
it
pendomer
smiled
as
though
she
considered
this
not
improbable
and
he
continued
with
growing
embarrassment
and
indignation
she
says
there
must
have
been
others
pendomer
smile
grew
reminiscent
any
number
of
others
that
she
is
only
an
incident
in
my
life
er
as
you
have
mentioned
patricia
has
certain
notions
northern
idiocies
about
the
awfulness
of
a
young
fellow
sowing
his
wild
oats
which
you
and
i
know
perfectly
well
he
is
going
to
do
anyhow
if
he
is
worth
his
salt
but
she
does
know
it
poor
little
girl
so
she
listen
to
reason
and
she
wo
come
downstairs
which
lamented
rudolph
musgrave
plaintively
is
particularly
awkward
in
a
he
drummed
his
fingers
for
a
moment
on
the
table
it
is
he
summed
up
a
combination
of
ibsen
and
hysterics
and
of
er
rather
declamatory
observations
concerning
there
being
one
law
for
the
man
and
another
for
the
woman
and
patricia
realization
of
the
mistake
we
both
made
and
all
that
sort
of
nonsense
you
know
exactly
as
if
i
give
you
my
word
she
were
one
of
those
women
who
want
to
vote
the
colonel
patently
considered
that
feminine
outrageousness
could
go
no
farther
and
she
is
taking
menthol
and
green
tea
and
mustard
plasters
and
i
do
know
what
all
in
bed
prior
to
to
taking
leave
pendomer
suggested
er
that
was
mentioned
i
believe
said
colonel
musgrave
but
of
course
she
was
only
talking
pendomer
looked
about
her
and
without
the
lawns
and
trim
were
very
beautiful
in
the
morning
sunlight
within
the
same
sunlight
sparkled
over
the
heavy
breakfast
service
and
gleamed
in
the
high
walnut
panels
of
the
she
viewed
the
comfortable
appointments
about
her
a
little
wistfully
for
pendomer
purse
was
not
of
course
said
she
as
in
meditation
there
was
the
money
yes
said
rudolph
musgrave
slowly
there
was
the
money
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
drew
himself
erect
here
was
a
moment
he
must
give
its
full
dramatic
value
oh
no
clarice
my
marriage
may
have
been
an
eminently
sensible
one
but
i
love
my
wife
oh
believe
me
i
love
her
very
tenderly
poor
little
patricia
i
have
weathered
some
birthdays
and
i
have
done
much
as
other
men
do
and
all
that
there
have
been
flirtations
and
suchlike
and
er
some
women
have
been
kinder
to
me
than
i
deserved
but
i
love
her
and
there
has
not
been
a
moment
since
she
came
into
my
life
i
have
loved
her
and
been
he
waved
his
hands
now
impotently
almost
theatrically
sickened
at
the
thought
of
the
others
pendomer
foot
tapped
the
floor
whilst
he
spoke
when
he
had
made
an
ending
she
inclined
her
head
toward
him
thank
you
said
pendomer
colonel
musgrave
bit
his
lip
and
he
flushed
that
said
he
hastily
was
different
but
the
difference
whatever
may
have
been
its
nature
was
seemingly
a
matter
of
unimportance
to
pendomer
who
was
in
meditation
she
rested
her
ample
chin
on
a
hand
for
a
moment
and
when
pendomer
raised
her
face
her
voice
was
free
from
affectation
you
will
probably
never
understand
that
this
particular
july
day
is
a
crucial
point
in
your
life
you
will
probably
remember
it
if
you
remember
it
at
all
simply
as
that
morning
when
patricia
found
some
old
letters
and
behaved
rather
unreasonably
about
them
it
was
the
merest
trifle
you
will
think
john
charteris
understands
women
better
than
you
do
rudolph
i
need
not
pretend
at
this
late
day
to
be
as
clever
as
jack
the
colonel
said
in
some
bewilderment
but
why
not
more
succinctly
state
that
the
escurial
is
not
a
dromedary
although
there
are
many
flies
in
france
for
what
on
earth
has
jack
to
do
with
crucial
points
and
july
mornings
why
i
suppose
i
only
made
bold
to
introduce
his
name
for
the
sake
of
an
illustration
rudolph
for
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
realize
precisely
why
any
woman
did
anything
is
invariably
the
woman
who
did
it
yet
there
comes
in
every
married
woman
existence
that
time
when
she
realizes
suddenly
that
her
husband
has
a
past
which
might
be
taken
as
in
itself
a
complete
and
rounded
life
as
a
life
which
had
run
the
gamut
of
all
ordinary
human
passions
and
had
become
familiar
with
all
ordinary
human
passions
a
dishearteningly
long
while
before
she
ever
came
into
that
life
a
woman
never
realizes
that
of
her
lover
somehow
but
to
know
that
your
husband
the
father
of
your
child
has
lived
for
other
women
a
life
in
which
you
had
no
part
and
never
can
have
part
she
realizes
that
at
one
time
or
another
and
and
it
sickens
her
pendomer
smiled
as
she
echoed
his
phrase
but
her
eyes
were
not
mirthful
ah
she
hungers
for
those
dead
years
rudolph
and
though
you
devote
your
whole
remaining
life
to
her
nothing
can
ever
make
up
for
them
and
she
always
hates
those
shadowy
women
who
have
stolen
them
from
her
a
woman
never
at
heart
forgives
the
other
women
who
have
loved
her
husband
even
though
she
cease
to
care
for
him
herself
for
she
remembers
ah
you
men
forget
so
easily
rudolph
god
had
not
invented
memory
when
he
created
adam
it
was
kept
for
the
woman
then
ensued
a
pause
during
which
rudolph
musgrave
smiled
down
upon
her
irresolutely
for
he
abhorred
a
scene
as
his
vernacular
phrased
it
and
to
him
clarice
present
manner
bordered
upon
both
the
scenic
and
the
incomprehensible
ah
you
women
he
temporized
there
was
a
glance
from
eyes
whose
luster
time
and
irregular
living
had
conspired
to
dim
ah
you
men
pendomer
retorted
and
there
we
have
the
tragedy
of
life
in
a
nutshell
silence
lasted
for
a
while
the
colonel
was
finding
this
matutinal
talk
discomfortably
opulent
in
pauses
rudolph
and
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
in
marrying
patricia
you
swindled
her
and
naturally
his
eyebrows
lifted
because
a
woman
wants
love
well
well
and
do
i
love
patricia
i
dare
say
that
you
think
you
do
only
you
have
played
at
loving
so
long
you
are
really
unable
to
love
anybody
as
a
girl
has
every
right
to
be
loved
in
her
twenties
yes
rudolph
you
are
being
rather
subtly
punished
for
the
good
times
you
have
had
and
after
all
the
saddest
punishment
is
something
that
happens
in
us
not
something
which
happens
to
us
i
wish
you
would
laugh
clarice
i
wish
i
did
have
to
for
i
would
get
far
more
comfort
out
of
crying
and
i
do
dare
to
because
of
my
complexion
it
comes
in
a
round
pasteboard
box
nowadays
you
know
rudolph
with
french
mendacities
all
over
the
top
and
my
eyebrows
come
in
a
fat
crayon
and
the
healthful
glow
of
my
lips
comes
in
a
little
porcelain
tub
pendomer
was
playing
with
a
teaspoon
now
and
a
smile
hovered
about
the
aforementioned
lips
and
yet
do
you
remember
rudolph
said
she
that
evening
at
assequin
when
i
wore
a
blue
gown
and
they
were
playing
and
you
said
yes
there
was
an
effective
little
catch
in
his
voice
you
were
a
wonderful
girl
clarice
sunshine
girl
i
used
to
call
you
and
blue
was
always
your
color
it
went
with
your
eyes
so
exactly
and
those
big
sleeves
they
wore
then
those
crushable
sleeves
they
suited
your
slender
youthfulness
so
perfectly
ah
i
remember
it
as
though
it
were
yesterday
pendomer
majestically
rose
to
her
feet
it
was
pink
and
it
was
at
the
whitebrier
you
said
what
you
said
and
and
you
do
deserve
anything
but
what
you
are
getting
she
concluded
grimly
i
it
was
so
long
ago
rudolph
musgrave
apologized
with
mingled
discomfort
and
vagueness
yes
she
conceded
rather
sadly
it
was
so
long
oh
very
long
ago
for
we
were
young
then
and
we
believed
in
things
and
and
jack
charteris
had
not
taken
a
fancy
to
me
she
sighed
and
drummed
her
fingers
on
the
table
but
women
have
always
helped
and
shielded
you
have
they
rudolph
and
now
i
am
going
to
help
you
too
for
you
have
shown
me
the
way
you
do
deserve
it
in
the
least
but
i
do
it
ii
thus
it
shortly
came
about
that
pendomer
mounted
in
meditative
mood
to
musgrave
rooms
and
that
pendomer
recovering
her
breath
entered
without
knocking
into
a
gloom
where
cologne
and
menthol
and
the
odor
of
warm
rubber
contended
for
mastery
for
patricia
had
decided
that
she
was
very
ill
indeed
and
was
sobbing
softly
in
bed
very
calmly
pendomer
opened
a
window
letting
in
a
flood
of
fresh
air
and
sunshine
very
calmly
she
drew
a
chair
a
substantial
to
the
bedside
and
very
calmly
she
began
my
dear
rudolph
has
told
me
of
this
ridiculous
affair
and
oh
you
equally
ridiculous
girl
she
removed
with
deft
fingers
a
damp
and
clinging
bandage
from
about
patricia
head
and
patted
the
back
of
patricia
hand
placidly
patricia
was
by
this
time
sitting
erect
in
bed
and
her
coppery
hair
was
thick
about
her
face
which
was
colorless
and
altogether
she
was
very
rigid
and
very
indignant
and
very
pretty
and
very
very
young
how
dare
he
tell
you
or
anybody
else
she
cried
we
are
such
old
friends
remember
pendomer
pleaded
and
rearranged
the
pillows
soothingly
about
her
hostess
and
i
want
to
talk
to
you
quietly
and
sensibly
patricia
sank
back
among
the
pillows
and
inhaled
the
fresh
air
which
in
spite
of
herself
she
found
agreeable
i
somehow
i
do
feel
very
sensible
she
murmured
half
sulky
and
half
pendomer
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
plunged
into
the
heart
of
things
you
are
a
woman
dear
she
said
gently
though
heaven
knows
it
must
have
been
only
yesterday
you
were
playing
about
the
nursery
and
one
of
the
facts
we
women
must
face
eventually
is
that
man
is
a
polygamous
animal
it
is
unfortunate
perhaps
but
it
is
true
civilization
may
veneer
the
fact
but
nothing
will
ever
override
it
not
even
in
these
new
horseless
carriages
a
man
may
give
his
wife
the
best
that
is
in
him
his
love
his
trust
his
life
work
but
it
is
only
the
best
there
is
left
we
give
our
hearts
men
dole
out
theirs
as
people
feed
bread
to
birds
with
a
crumb
for
everyone
his
wife
has
the
remnant
and
the
best
we
women
can
do
is
to
remember
we
are
credibly
informed
that
half
a
loaf
is
preferable
to
no
bread
at
all
her
face
sobered
and
she
added
pensively
we
might
contrive
a
better
universe
we
sister
women
but
this
is
not
permitted
us
so
we
must
take
it
as
it
is
patricia
stirred
as
talking
died
away
i
do
believe
it
said
she
and
she
added
with
emphasis
and
anyhow
i
hate
that
nasty
trollop
ah
but
you
do
believe
it
pendomer
voice
was
insistent
you
knew
it
years
before
you
went
into
long
frocks
that
knowledge
is
i
suppose
a
legacy
from
our
mothers
patricia
frowned
petulantly
and
then
burst
into
choking
sobs
oh
she
cried
it
damnable
some
other
woman
has
had
what
i
can
never
have
and
i
wanted
it
so
that
first
love
that
means
everything
the
love
he
gave
her
when
i
was
only
a
messy
little
girl
with
and
too
many
hands
and
feet
oh
that
that
she
had
everything
there
was
an
interval
during
which
pendomer
smiled
crookedly
and
patricia
continued
to
sob
although
at
lengthening
intervals
then
pendomer
lifted
the
packet
of
letters
lying
on
the
bed
and
cleared
her
throat
h
said
she
so
this
is
what
caused
all
the
trouble
you
mind
and
considering
silence
as
equivalent
to
acquiescence
she
drew
out
a
letter
at
hazard
and
read
aloud
a
line
woman
of
all
the
world
to
tell
you
but
what
have
i
to
tell
you
after
all
only
the
old
old
message
so
often
told
that
it
seems
scarcely
worth
while
to
bother
the
postman
about
it
just
three
words
that
innumerable
dead
lips
have
whispered
while
life
was
yet
good
and
old
people
were
unreasonable
and
skies
were
blue
three
words
that
our
unborn
children
children
will
whisper
to
one
another
when
we
too
have
gone
to
help
the
grasses
in
their
growing
or
to
nourish
the
victorious
swaying
hosts
of
some
field
of
daffodils
just
three
words
that
is
my
message
to
you
my
lady
ah
it
is
weary
waiting
for
a
sight
of
your
dear
face
through
these
long
days
that
are
so
much
alike
and
all
so
empty
and
colorless
my
heart
grows
hungry
as
i
think
of
your
great
green
eyes
and
of
the
mouth
that
is
like
a
little
wound
i
want
you
so
o
dearest
girl
in
all
the
world
i
want
you
ah
time
travels
very
slowly
that
brings
you
back
to
me
and
meanwhile
i
can
but
dream
of
you
and
send
you
impotent
scrawls
that
only
vex
me
with
their
futility
for
my
desire
of
you
the
remainder
said
pendomer
clearing
her
throat
once
more
appears
to
consist
of
insanity
and
heretical
sentiments
in
about
equal
proportions
all
written
at
the
top
of
a
boy
breaking
voice
it
colonel
musgrave
voice
quite
is
it
during
the
reading
patricia
leaning
on
one
elbow
had
regarded
her
companion
with
wide
eyes
and
flushed
cheeks
now
you
see
she
cried
indignantly
he
loved
her
he
was
simply
crazy
about
her
why
yes
pendomer
replaced
the
letter
carefully
almost
caressingly
among
its
companions
my
dear
it
was
years
ago
i
think
time
has
by
this
wreaked
a
vengeance
far
more
bitter
than
you
could
ever
plan
on
the
woman
who
after
all
never
thought
to
wrong
you
for
the
bitterest
of
all
bitter
things
to
a
woman
to
some
women
at
least
is
to
grow
old
she
sighed
and
her
fingers
fretted
for
a
moment
with
the
counterpane
ah
who
will
write
the
tragedy
of
us
women
who
were
southern
beauties
once
we
were
queens
of
men
while
our
youth
lasted
and
diarists
still
prattle
charmingly
concerning
us
but
nothing
was
expected
of
us
save
to
be
beautiful
and
to
condescend
to
be
made
much
of
and
that
is
our
tragedy
for
very
few
things
my
dear
are
more
pitiable
than
the
of
the
pitiful
butterfly
woman
whose
mind
can
not
can
not
because
of
its
very
nature
reach
to
anything
higher
strips
her
of
everything
the
admiration
the
flattery
the
shallow
merriment
all
the
little
things
that
her
little
mind
longs
for
and
other
women
take
her
place
in
spite
of
her
futile
pitiful
efforts
to
remain
young
and
the
world
goes
on
as
before
and
there
is
a
whispering
in
the
moonlit
garden
and
young
people
steal
off
for
wholly
superfluous
glasses
of
water
and
the
men
give
her
duty
dances
and
she
is
old
ah
so
old
under
the
rouge
and
inane
smiles
and
dainty
fripperies
that
caricature
her
lost
youth
no
my
dear
you
need
envy
this
woman
pity
her
my
dear
pleaded
clarice
pendomer
and
with
a
note
of
earnestness
in
her
voice
such
a
woman
said
patricia
with
distinctness
deserves
no
pity
well
pendomer
conceded
drily
she
does
get
it
probably
because
she
always
grows
fat
from
sheer
lack
of
to
resist
sloth
and
gluttony
the
only
agreeable
vices
left
her
and
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
can
a
fat
woman
be
converted
into
either
a
pleasing
or
heroic
figure
pendomer
paused
for
a
and
smiled
though
not
very
pleasantly
it
is
doubtless
said
she
a
sight
for
gods
and
quite
certainly
for
men
to
laugh
at
this
silly
woman
striving
to
regain
a
vanished
frugality
of
waist
yes
i
suppose
it
is
amusing
but
it
is
also
pitiful
and
it
is
more
pitiful
still
if
she
has
ever
loved
a
man
in
the
unreasoning
way
these
shallow
women
sometimes
do
men
age
so
slowly
the
men
a
girl
first
knows
are
young
long
after
she
has
reached
yes
they
go
on
dancing
cotillions
and
talking
nonsense
in
the
garden
long
after
she
has
taken
to
shoes
and
the
man
is
still
young
and
he
cares
for
some
other
woman
who
is
young
and
has
all
that
she
has
lost
and
it
seems
so
unfair
said
pendomer
patricia
regarded
her
for
a
moment
the
purple
eyes
were
alert
their
glance
was
hard
you
seem
to
know
all
about
this
woman
patricia
began
in
a
level
voice
i
have
heard
of
course
what
everyone
in
lichfield
whispers
about
you
and
rudolph
i
have
even
teased
rudolph
about
it
but
until
i
had
believed
it
was
a
lie
it
is
often
a
mistake
to
indulge
in
uncommon
opinions
said
pendomer
you
get
more
fun
and
interest
out
of
it
i
do
deny
but
the
bill
my
dear
is
unconscionable
so
you
confess
it
my
dear
and
who
am
i
to
stand
aside
like
a
coward
and
see
you
make
a
mountain
of
this
affair
an
affair
which
rudolph
and
i
had
practically
forgotten
oh
years
ago
until
why
why
you
be
jealous
of
me
pendomer
concluded
patricia
regarded
her
with
deliberation
in
the
windy
sunlight
pendomer
was
a
woman
but
unmistakably
preserved
moreover
there
was
a
great
deal
of
her
and
her
nose
was
in
need
of
a
judicious
application
of
powder
of
which
there
was
a
superfluity
behind
her
ears
was
this
the
siren
patricia
had
dreaded
patricia
clearly
perceived
that
whatever
had
been
her
husband
relations
with
this
woman
he
had
been
manifestly
entrapped
into
the
imbroglio
a
victim
to
pendomer
inordinate
love
of
attention
which
was
indeed
tolerably
notorious
and
patricia
anger
against
rudolph
musgrave
gave
way
to
a
rather
contemptuous
pity
and
a
remorse
for
not
having
taken
better
care
of
him
no
answered
pendomer
to
her
unspoken
thought
no
woman
could
be
seriously
jealous
of
me
yes
i
dare
say
i
am
and
vain
and
frivolous
and
harmless
but
she
added
meditatively
you
hate
me
just
the
same
my
dear
pendomer
patricia
began
with
cool
courtesy
then
hesitated
yes
she
conceded
i
dare
say
it
is
unreasonable
but
i
do
hate
you
like
the
very
old
nick
why
then
spoke
pendomer
with
cheerfulness
everything
is
as
it
should
be
she
rose
and
smiled
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
must
be
leaving
matocton
the
ullwethers
are
very
pressing
and
i
really
know
how
to
get
out
of
paying
them
a
visit
so
sorry
to
lose
you
cooed
patricia
but
of
course
you
know
best
i
believe
some
very
good
people
are
visiting
the
ullwethers
nowadays
she
extended
the
letters
blandly
may
i
restore
your
property
she
queried
with
utmost
gentleness
thanks
clarice
pendomer
took
them
and
kissed
her
hostess
not
without
tenderness
on
the
brow
my
dear
be
kind
to
rudolph
he
he
is
rather
an
attractive
man
you
know
and
other
women
are
kind
to
him
we
of
lichfield
have
always
said
that
he
and
jack
charteris
were
the
most
dangerous
men
that
even
lichfield
has
ever
produced
why
do
people
really
find
charteris
particularly
attractive
patricia
demanded
so
quickly
and
so
innocently
that
pendomer
could
not
deny
herself
the
glance
of
a
charlatan
who
applauds
his
legerdemain
and
patricia
colored
oh
well
you
know
how
lichfield
gossips
said
pendomer
iii
colonel
musgrave
had
smoked
a
preposterous
number
of
unsatisfying
cigarettes
on
the
big
front
porch
of
matocton
whilst
pendomer
was
absent
on
her
mission
and
on
her
return
flushed
and
triumphant
he
rose
in
eloquent
silence
i
done
it
rudolph
said
pendomer
done
what
he
queried
blankly
restored
what
my
incomprehensible
lawyers
call
the
achieved
peace
with
honor
carried
off
the
spoils
of
war
and
in
short
arranged
everything
answered
pendomer
and
sank
into
a
rustic
chair
which
creaked
admonishingly
and
all
she
added
bringing
a
fan
into
play
without
a
single
falsehood
am
not
to
blame
if
patricia
has
jumped
at
the
conclusion
that
these
letters
were
written
to
me
my
word
said
rudolph
musgrave
your
methods
of
restoring
domestic
peace
to
a
distracted
household
are
to
say
the
least
original
he
seated
himself
and
lighted
another
cigarette
oh
well
patricia
is
not
deaf
you
know
and
she
has
lived
in
lichfield
quite
a
while
pendomer
said
abruptly
i
have
half
a
mind
to
tell
you
some
of
the
things
i
know
about
aline
van
orden
please
do
said
colonel
musgrave
for
i
would
inevitably
beard
you
on
my
own
porch
and
smite
you
to
the
and
i
am
hardly
young
enough
for
such
adventures
and
poor
aline
is
dead
and
the
rest
of
us
are
now
rudolph
and
we
go
in
to
dinner
with
the
veterans
who
call
us
and
we
are
prominent
in
charitable
enterprises
but
there
was
a
time
when
we
were
not
exactly
hideous
in
appearance
and
men
did
many
mad
things
for
our
sakes
and
we
never
lose
the
memory
of
that
time
pleasant
memories
are
among
the
many
privileges
of
women
yes
added
pendomer
meditatively
we
derive
much
the
same
pleasure
from
them
a
cripple
does
from
rearranging
the
athletic
medals
he
once
won
or
a
starving
man
from
thinking
of
the
many
excellent
dinners
he
has
eaten
but
we
ca
and
we
would
part
with
them
nevertheless
rudolph
musgrave
however
had
not
honored
her
with
much
attention
and
was
puzzling
over
the
more
or
less
incomprehensible
situation
and
perceiving
this
she
ran
on
after
a
little
oh
it
worked
it
worked
beautifully
you
see
she
would
always
have
been
very
jealous
of
that
other
woman
but
with
me
it
is
different
she
has
always
known
that
scandalous
story
about
you
and
me
and
she
has
always
known
me
as
i
am
a
frivolous
and
say
corpulent
for
it
is
a
more
dignified
word
and
generally
unattractive
chaperon
and
she
think
of
me
as
ever
having
been
anything
else
young
people
never
really
believe
in
their
elders
youth
rudolph
at
heart
they
think
we
came
into
the
world
with
and
hair
all
complete
so
she
is
only
sorry
for
you
now
rather
as
a
mother
would
be
for
a
naughty
child
as
for
me
she
is
jealous
but
sighed
pendomer
she
is
of
me
colonel
musgrave
rose
to
his
feet
it
is
fair
said
he
the
letters
were
distinctly
compromising
it
is
fair
you
should
shoulder
the
blame
for
a
woman
who
was
nothing
to
you
it
is
fair
you
should
be
placed
in
such
a
false
position
what
matter
pleaded
pendomer
the
letters
are
mine
to
burn
if
i
choose
i
have
read
one
of
them
by
the
way
and
it
is
almost
word
for
word
a
letter
you
wrote
me
a
good
twenty
years
ago
and
you
it
for
patricia
benefit
too
it
seems
you
ought
to
get
a
mimeograph
oh
very
well
it
does
matter
now
for
patricia
will
say
nothing
or
not
at
least
to
you
she
added
still
he
began
ah
rudolph
if
i
want
to
do
a
foolish
thing
why
wo
you
let
me
what
else
is
a
woman
for
they
are
always
doing
foolish
things
i
have
known
a
woman
to
throw
a
man
over
because
she
had
seen
him
without
a
collar
and
i
have
known
another
actually
to
marry
a
man
because
she
happened
to
be
in
love
with
him
i
have
known
a
woman
to
go
on
wearing
pink
organdie
after
she
has
passed
forty
and
i
have
known
a
woman
to
go
on
caring
for
a
man
who
she
knew
was
worth
caring
for
long
after
he
had
forgotten
we
are
not
brave
and
sensible
like
you
men
so
why
not
let
me
be
foolish
if
i
want
to
be
if
said
colonel
musgrave
in
some
perplexity
i
understand
one
word
of
this
farrago
i
will
be
qualified
in
various
ways
but
you
do
have
to
understand
she
pleaded
you
mean
he
asked
i
mean
that
i
was
always
fond
of
aline
anyhow
nonsense
and
he
was
conscious
with
vexation
that
he
had
undeniably
flushed
i
mean
then
i
am
a
woman
and
understand
everything
is
as
near
what
it
should
be
as
is
possible
while
patricia
is
seeing
so
much
of
we
will
call
it
the
artistic
temperament
pendomer
shrugged
but
if
i
went
on
in
that
line
you
would
believe
i
was
jealous
and
heaven
knows
i
am
not
the
least
bit
so
with
the
unavoidable
qualification
that
being
a
woman
i
ca
help
rising
superior
to
he
said
you
mean
jack
charteris
but
what
on
earth
has
he
to
do
with
these
letters
i
do
mean
any
proper
names
at
all
i
simply
mean
you
are
not
to
undo
my
work
it
would
only
signify
trouble
and
dissatisfaction
and
giving
up
all
this
she
waved
her
hand
lightly
toward
the
lawns
of
matocton
and
it
would
mean
our
giving
you
up
for
you
know
you
have
any
money
of
your
own
rudolph
ah
rudolph
we
ca
give
you
up
we
need
you
to
lead
our
lichfield
germans
and
to
tell
us
naughty
little
stories
and
keep
us
amused
so
be
sensible
rudolph
permit
me
to
point
out
i
firmly
believe
that
silence
is
the
perfectest
herald
of
joy
observed
colonel
musgrave
only
i
do
understand
why
you
should
have
dragged
john
charteris
name
into
this
ludicrous
affair
you
really
do
not
understand
but
colonel
musgrave
handsome
face
declared
very
plainly
that
he
did
not
well
pendomer
reflected
i
dare
say
it
is
best
upon
the
whole
you
should
and
now
you
must
excuse
me
for
i
am
leaving
for
the
ullwethers
and
i
sha
ever
be
invited
to
matocton
again
and
i
must
tell
my
maid
to
pack
up
she
is
a
little
fool
and
it
will
break
her
heart
to
be
leaving
pilkins
all
human
beings
are
tediously
alike
but
allowing
ample
time
for
her
to
dispose
of
my
best
lingerie
and
of
her
unavoidable
lamentations
i
ought
to
make
the
i
have
noticed
that
one
usually
does
somehow
said
pendomer
and
seemed
to
smack
of
allegories
and
yet
it
may
have
been
because
she
knew
as
who
knew
better
something
of
that
mischief
nature
which
was
now
afoot
iv
the
colonel
burned
the
malefic
letters
that
afternoon
indeed
the
episode
set
him
to
ransacking
the
desk
in
which
patricia
had
found
them
a
desk
which
as
you
have
heard
was
heaped
with
the
miscellaneous
correspondence
of
the
colonel
father
dating
back
a
and
more
much
curious
matter
the
colonel
discovered
there
for
wild
will
musgrave
had
been
a
career
and
over
one
packet
of
letters
in
particular
the
colonel
sat
for
a
long
while
with
an
unwontedly
troubled
face
part
six
byways
cry
and
take
heart
eros
is
gone
nor
may
we
follow
to
that
loftier
air
olympians
breathe
take
heart
and
enter
where
a
lighter
love
laughs
i
the
sun
oblivious
of
tangled
webs
by
ancient
wearied
weavers
for
it
may
be
his
guidance
leads
to
lovers
of
such
as
we
and
hearts
so
credulous
as
to
be
won
cry
put
away
vain
memories
of
all
old
sorrows
and
of
all
old
joys
and
learn
that
life
is
never
quite
amiss
so
long
as
unreflective
girls
and
boys
remember
that
young
lips
were
meant
to
kiss
and
hold
that
laughter
is
a
seemly
noise
paul
vanderhoffen
i
patricia
sat
in
the
great
that
stands
behind
matocton
and
pondered
over
a
note
from
her
husband
who
was
in
lichfield
superintending
the
appearance
of
the
july
number
of
the
historical
association
quarterly
charteris
lay
at
her
feet
glancing
rapidly
over
a
lengthy
letter
which
was
from
his
wife
in
richmond
the
morning
mail
was
just
in
and
patricia
had
despatched
charteris
for
her
letters
on
the
plea
that
the
woods
were
too
beautiful
to
leave
and
that
matocton
in
the
unsettled
state
which
marks
the
end
of
the
week
in
a
was
intolerable
she
undoubtedly
was
partial
to
the
grove
having
spent
the
last
ten
mornings
there
charteris
had
overrated
her
modest
literary
abilities
so
far
as
to
ask
her
advice
in
certain
details
of
his
new
book
which
was
to
appear
in
the
autumn
and
they
had
found
a
vernal
solitude
besides
being
extremely
picturesque
to
be
conducive
to
the
forming
of
really
matured
opinions
moreover
she
was
assured
that
none
of
the
members
of
the
would
misunderstand
her
motives
people
were
so
much
less
censorious
in
the
country
there
was
something
in
the
pastoral
purity
of
nature
seen
face
to
face
which
brought
out
one
noblest
instincts
and
put
an
end
to
all
horrid
gossip
and
did
think
so
and
what
was
her
real
opinion
of
that
rumor
about
the
hardresses
and
was
the
woman
as
bad
as
people
said
she
was
thus
had
patricia
spoken
in
the
privacy
of
her
chamber
at
that
hour
when
ladies
do
up
their
hair
for
the
night
and
discourse
of
mysteries
it
is
at
this
time
they
are
said
to
babble
out
their
hearts
to
one
another
and
so
beyond
doubt
this
must
have
been
the
real
state
of
the
case
as
patricia
admitted
she
had
given
up
bridge
and
taken
to
literature
only
during
the
past
year
she
might
more
honestly
have
said
within
the
last
two
weeks
in
any
event
she
now
conversed
of
authors
with
a
fitful
persistence
like
that
of
an
machine
her
comments
were
delightfully
frank
and
original
as
she
had
an
unusually
good
memory
of
two
books
she
was
apt
to
prefer
the
one
with
the
wider
margin
and
she
was
becoming
sufficiently
familiar
with
a
number
of
poets
to
quote
them
inaccurately
we
have
all
seen
john
charteris
portraits
and
most
of
us
have
read
his
books
or
at
least
the
volume
entitled
old
which
caused
the
to
apostrophize
its
author
as
a
child
of
genius
whose
ardent
soul
has
sounded
the
mysteries
of
life
whose
inner
vision
sweeps
over
ever
widening
fields
of
thought
and
whose
chiseled
phrases
continue
patriotically
to
perpetuate
the
beauty
of
lichfield
past
but
for
present
purposes
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
this
jewelsmith
of
words
was
slight
and
dark
and
and
that
his
hair
was
thin
and
that
he
was
not
it
may
be
of
interest
to
his
admirers
a
growing
cult
to
add
that
his
reason
for
wearing
a
mustache
in
a
period
of
faces
was
that
without
it
his
mouth
was
not
pleasant
to
look
upon
heigho
patricia
said
at
length
with
a
little
laugh
it
is
very
strange
that
both
of
our
encumbrances
should
arrive
on
the
same
day
it
is
unfortunate
charteris
admitted
lazily
but
the
blessed
state
of
matrimony
is
liable
to
these
mishaps
let
us
be
thankful
that
my
wife
whim
to
visit
her
aunt
has
given
us
at
least
two
perfect
golden
weeks
husbands
are
like
bad
pennies
and
wives
resemble
the
cat
whose
adventures
have
been
commemorated
by
one
of
our
really
popular
poets
they
always
come
back
patricia
communed
with
herself
and
to
charteris
seemed
as
she
sat
in
the
chequered
sunlight
far
more
desirable
than
a
married
woman
has
any
right
to
be
i
wish
she
began
slowly
oh
but
you
know
it
was
positively
criminal
negligence
not
to
have
included
a
dozen
fairies
among
my
sponsors
i
too
have
desiderated
this
sensible
precaution
said
charteris
and
laughed
his
utter
comprehension
but
after
all
he
said
and
snapped
his
fingers
gaily
we
still
have
hours
patricia
let
us
forget
the
crudities
of
life
and
say
foolish
things
to
each
other
for
i
am
pastorally
inclined
this
morning
patricia
i
wish
to
lie
at
your
feet
and
pipe
amorous
ditties
upon
an
oaten
reed
have
you
such
an
article
about
you
patricia
he
drew
a
from
his
pocket
and
pondered
over
it
or
would
you
prefer
that
i
whistle
into
the
opening
of
this
to
the
effect
that
we
must
gather
our
while
we
may
for
time
is
still
and
that
a
drear
old
age
not
to
mention
our
spouses
will
soon
descend
upon
us
a
is
not
arcadian
patricia
but
it
makes
a
very
creditable
noise
do
be
foolish
she
protested
with
an
indulgent
smile
i
am
unhappy
unhappy
that
i
have
chanced
to
fall
in
love
with
you
patricia
it
is
an
accident
which
might
befall
any
really
intelligent
person
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
ruefully
i
have
done
wrong
to
let
you
talk
to
me
as
you
have
done
of
late
i
oh
jack
i
am
afraid
charteris
meditated
somewhere
in
a
neighboring
thicket
a
bird
trilled
out
his
song
a
contented
song
that
called
his
mate
to
witness
how
infinitely
blest
above
all
other
birds
was
he
charteris
heard
him
to
the
end
and
languidly
made
as
to
applaud
then
charteris
raised
his
eyebrows
of
your
husband
patricia
he
queried
i
rudolph
does
bother
about
me
nowadays
sufficiently
to
notice
anything
charteris
smiled
of
my
wife
patricia
good
gracious
no
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
you
will
explain
matters
satisfactorily
to
your
wife
for
i
have
always
heard
that
practise
makes
perfect
charteris
laughed
a
low
and
very
musical
laugh
of
me
then
patricia
i
i
think
it
is
rather
of
myself
i
am
afraid
oh
i
hate
you
when
you
smile
like
that
you
have
evil
eyes
jack
stop
it
quit
hounding
me
with
your
illicit
fascinations
the
hand
she
had
raised
in
threatening
fashion
fell
back
into
her
lap
and
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
once
more
my
nerves
are
somewhat
upset
by
the
approaching
prospect
of
connubial
felicity
i
suppose
really
though
your
conceit
is
appalling
charteris
gave
vent
to
a
chuckle
and
raised
the
to
his
lips
when
you
are
quite
through
your
histrionic
efforts
he
suggested
apologetically
i
will
proceed
with
my
amorous
pipings
really
patricia
one
might
fancy
you
the
heroine
of
a
society
drama
working
up
the
sympathies
of
the
audience
before
taking
to
evil
ways
surely
you
are
not
about
to
leave
your
dear
good
patient
husband
patricia
heroines
only
do
that
on
dark
and
stormy
nights
and
in
an
opera
toilette
wearing
her
best
gown
seems
always
to
affect
a
heroine
in
that
way
charteris
at
this
point
dropped
the
and
drew
nearer
to
her
his
voice
sank
to
a
pleading
cadence
we
are
in
arcadia
patricia
virtue
and
vice
are
contraband
in
this
charming
country
and
must
be
left
at
the
frontier
let
us
be
adorably
foolish
and
happy
my
lady
and
forget
for
a
little
the
evil
days
that
approach
can
you
not
fancy
this
to
be
arcadia
patricia
it
requires
the
merest
trifle
of
imagination
listen
very
carefully
and
you
will
hear
the
hoofs
of
fauns
rustling
among
the
fallen
leaves
they
are
watching
us
patricia
from
behind
every
they
think
you
a
dryad
the
queen
of
all
the
dryads
with
the
most
glorious
eyes
and
hair
and
the
most
tempting
lips
in
all
the
forest
after
a
little
shaggy
ventripotent
pan
will
grow
jealous
and
ravish
you
away
from
me
as
he
stole
syrinx
from
her
lover
you
are
very
beautiful
patricia
you
are
quite
incredibly
beautiful
i
adore
you
patricia
would
you
mind
if
i
held
your
hand
it
is
a
foolish
thing
to
do
but
it
is
preëminently
arcadian
she
heard
him
with
downcast
eyes
and
her
cheeks
flushed
a
pink
color
that
was
agreeable
to
contemplation
do
do
you
really
care
for
me
jack
she
asked
softly
then
cried
no
no
you
need
answer
because
of
course
you
worship
me
madly
unboundedly
distractedly
they
all
do
but
you
do
it
more
convincingly
you
have
been
taking
lessons
at
i
dare
say
at
all
sorts
of
murky
institutions
and
jack
really
cross
my
heart
i
always
stopped
the
others
when
they
talked
this
way
i
tried
to
stop
you
too
you
know
i
did
she
raised
her
lashes
a
trifle
uncertainly
and
withdrew
her
hand
from
his
a
trifle
slowly
it
is
wrong
all
horribly
wrong
i
wonder
at
myself
i
ca
understand
how
in
the
world
i
can
be
such
a
fool
about
you
i
must
not
be
alone
with
you
again
i
must
tell
my
husband
everything
she
concluded
and
manifestly
not
meaning
a
word
of
what
she
said
by
all
means
assented
charteris
readily
let
tell
my
wife
too
it
will
make
things
so
very
interesting
rudolph
would
be
terribly
unhappy
she
reflected
he
would
probably
never
smile
again
said
charteris
and
my
wife
oh
it
would
upset
anne
quite
frightfully
it
is
our
altruistic
nay
our
bounden
duty
to
save
them
from
such
misery
i
i
do
know
what
to
do
she
wailed
the
obvious
course
said
he
after
reflection
is
to
shake
off
the
bonds
of
matrimony
without
further
delay
so
let
elope
patricia
patricia
who
was
really
unhappy
took
refuge
in
flippancy
and
laughed
i
make
it
a
rule
said
she
never
to
elope
on
fridays
besides
now
i
think
of
it
there
is
rudolph
ah
rudolph
does
care
a
worth
about
me
i
know
the
funny
part
is
that
he
does
know
it
he
has
simply
assumed
he
is
devoted
to
me
because
all
respectable
people
are
devoted
to
their
wives
i
can
assure
you
he
would
be
a
veritable
othello
if
there
were
any
scandal
and
would
infinitely
prefer
the
bolster
to
the
he
would
have
us
followed
and
torn
apart
by
wild
policemen
charteris
meditated
for
a
moment
rudolph
as
you
are
perfectly
aware
would
simply
deplore
the
terribly
lax
modern
notions
in
regard
to
marriage
and
talk
to
newspaper
reporters
about
this
much
he
measured
it
between
thumb
and
forefinger
concerning
the
beauty
and
chivalry
of
the
south
he
would
do
nothing
more
i
question
if
rudolph
musgrave
would
ever
in
any
circumstances
be
capable
of
decisive
action
ah
do
make
fun
of
rudolph
she
cried
quickly
rudolph
ca
help
it
if
he
is
conscientious
and
in
consequence
rather
depressing
to
live
with
and
for
all
that
he
so
often
plays
the
about
women
like
grandma
pendomer
he
is
a
man
jack
a
clean
and
dunderheaded
man
you
are
you
are
puny
and
frivolous
and
you
sneer
too
much
and
you
are
making
a
fool
of
me
and
and
that
why
i
like
you
i
suppose
oh
i
wish
i
were
good
i
have
always
tried
to
be
good
and
there
does
seem
to
be
a
hatpin
in
the
world
that
makes
a
halo
sit
comfortably
now
jack
you
know
i
tried
to
be
good
i
never
let
you
kiss
me
and
i
never
let
you
hold
my
hand
until
and
and
patricia
paused
and
laughed
but
we
were
talking
of
rudolph
she
said
with
a
touch
of
weariness
rudolph
has
all
the
virtues
that
a
woman
most
admires
until
she
attempts
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
them
i
thank
you
said
charteris
for
the
high
opinion
you
entertain
of
my
moral
character
he
bestowed
a
reproachful
sigh
upon
her
and
continued
at
any
rate
rudolph
musgrave
has
been
an
unusually
lucky
man
the
luckiest
that
i
know
of
patricia
had
risen
as
if
to
go
she
turned
her
big
purple
eyes
on
him
for
a
moment
you
you
think
so
she
queried
hesitatingly
afterward
she
spread
out
her
hands
in
a
helpless
gesture
and
laughed
for
no
apparent
reason
and
sat
down
again
why
said
patricia
it
took
charteris
fully
an
hour
to
point
out
all
the
reasons
patricia
told
him
very
frankly
that
she
considered
him
to
be
talking
nonsense
but
she
seemed
quite
willing
to
listen
ii
sunset
was
approaching
on
the
following
afternoon
when
rudolph
musgrave
fresh
from
lichfield
whither
as
has
been
recorded
the
bringing
out
of
the
july
number
of
the
historical
associations
quarterly
had
called
him
came
out
on
the
front
porch
at
matocton
he
had
arrived
on
the
afternoon
train
about
an
hour
previously
in
time
to
superintend
little
roger
customary
evening
transactions
with
an
astounding
quantity
of
bread
and
milk
and
roger
abed
his
father
having
dressed
at
once
for
supper
found
himself
ready
for
that
meal
somewhat
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
the
indeed
only
one
of
them
was
visible
at
this
moment
a
woman
who
was
reading
on
a
rustic
bench
some
distance
from
the
house
and
whose
back
was
turned
to
him
the
poise
of
her
head
however
was
not
unfamiliar
also
it
is
not
everyone
who
has
hair
that
is
like
a
nimbus
of
gold
colonel
musgrave
threw
back
his
shoulders
and
drew
a
deep
breath
subsequently
with
a
fine
air
of
unconcern
he
inspected
the
view
from
the
porch
which
was
in
fact
quite
worthy
of
his
attention
interesting
things
have
happened
at
matocton
many
events
that
have
been
preserved
in
the
local
mythology
not
always
to
the
credit
of
the
old
musgraves
and
a
few
which
have
slipped
into
a
modest
niche
in
history
it
was
perhaps
on
these
that
colonel
musgrave
pondered
so
intently
once
the
farthingaled
and
gentry
came
in
sluggish
barges
to
matocton
and
the
broad
river
on
which
the
estate
faces
was
thick
with
bellying
sails
since
the
days
of
railroads
one
approaches
the
mansion
through
the
in
the
rear
and
enters
ignominiously
by
the
the
house
stands
on
a
considerable
elevation
the
main
portion
with
its
hipped
roof
and
mullioned
windows
is
very
old
but
the
two
wings
that
stretch
to
the
east
and
west
are
comparatively
modern
and
date
back
little
over
a
century
time
has
mellowed
them
into
harmony
with
the
major
part
of
the
house
and
the
kindly
virginia
creeper
has
done
its
utmost
to
conceal
the
fact
that
they
are
constructed
of
plebeian
bricks
which
were
baked
in
this
country
but
matocton
was
matocton
long
before
these
wings
were
built
and
a
mere
affair
of
yesterday
such
as
the
revolution
antedates
them
they
were
not
standing
when
tarleton
paid
his
famous
visit
to
matocton
in
the
main
hall
you
may
still
see
the
stairs
up
which
he
rode
on
horseback
and
the
slashes
which
his
saber
hacked
upon
the
to
the
front
of
the
mansion
lies
a
lawn
dotted
with
sundry
oaks
and
maples
and
thence
the
formal
gardens
descend
in
six
broad
terraces
there
is
when
summer
reigns
no
lovelier
spot
than
this
bright
medley
of
squares
and
stars
and
triangles
and
circles
all
euclid
in
flowerage
which
glow
with
multitudinous
colors
where
the
sun
strikes
you
will
find
no
new
flowers
at
matocton
though
here
are
verbenas
poppies
lavender
and
marigolds
hollyhocks
and
columbine
phlox
and
larkspur
and
meadowsweet
and
just
as
they
were
when
thomasine
musgrave
matocton
first
châtelaine
was
wont
to
tend
them
and
of
all
floral
parvenus
the
gardens
are
innocent
mark
the
walkways
the
seventh
terrace
was
until
lately
uncultivated
the
trees
having
been
cleared
away
to
afford
pasturage
it
is
now
closely
planted
with
beeches
none
of
great
size
and
extends
to
a
tangled
thicket
of
fieldpines
and
cedar
and
sassafras
and
blackberry
bushes
which
again
masks
a
drop
of
some
ten
feet
to
the
river
the
beach
here
is
narrow
at
high
tide
it
is
rarely
more
than
fifteen
feet
in
breadth
and
is
in
many
places
completely
submerged
past
this
the
river
lapses
into
the
horizon
line
without
a
break
save
on
an
extraordinarily
clear
day
when
bigelow
island
may
be
seen
as
a
dim
smudge
upon
the
west
all
these
things
rudolph
musgrave
regarded
with
curiously
deep
interest
for
one
who
had
seen
them
so
many
times
before
then
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
sauntered
forward
across
the
lawn
he
had
planned
several
appropriate
speeches
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
giving
them
utterance
he
merely
held
out
his
hand
in
an
awkward
fashion
and
said
anne
she
looked
up
from
her
reading
she
did
this
with
two
eyes
that
had
no
apparent
limits
to
their
depth
her
hand
was
soft
it
seemed
quite
lost
in
the
broad
palm
of
a
man
hand
dear
rudolph
she
said
as
simply
as
though
they
had
parted
yesterday
it
awfully
good
to
see
you
again
colonel
musgrave
cleared
his
throat
and
sat
down
beside
her
a
moment
later
colonel
musgrave
cleared
his
throat
once
more
then
charteris
laughed
it
was
a
pleasant
laugh
a
clear
rippling
carol
of
clean
mirth
that
sparkled
in
her
eyes
and
dimpled
in
her
wholesome
cheeks
so
do
you
find
it
very
very
awkward
awkward
he
cried
their
glances
met
in
a
flash
of
comprehension
which
seemed
to
purge
the
air
musgrave
was
not
in
the
least
now
he
laughed
and
lifted
an
admonitory
forefinger
oh
good
cynara
he
said
i
am
not
what
i
was
and
so
i
can
not
do
it
my
dear
i
really
can
not
possibly
live
up
to
the
requirements
of
being
a
buried
past
in
a
proper
or
play
i
would
have
to
come
back
from
new
zealand
or
the
transvaal
all
covered
with
glory
and
epaulets
and
have
found
you
in
the
last
throes
of
consumption
instead
you
have
fattened
anne
which
a
buried
past
never
does
and
which
shows
a
sad
lack
of
appreciation
for
my
feelings
and
i
ah
my
dear
i
must
confess
that
my
hair
is
growing
gray
and
that
my
life
has
not
been
entirely
empty
without
you
and
that
i
ate
and
enjoyed
two
at
luncheon
though
i
knew
i
should
see
you
i
am
afraid
we
are
neither
of
us
up
to
heroics
anne
so
let
be
sensible
and
comfy
my
dear
you
brute
she
cried
not
looking
irreparably
angry
yet
not
without
a
real
touch
of
vexation
do
you
know
that
every
woman
cherishes
the
picture
of
her
former
lovers
sitting
alone
in
the
twilight
and
growing
lackadaisical
over
undying
memories
and
faded
letters
and
you
you
approach
me
after
i
do
dare
to
think
how
many
years
as
calmly
as
if
i
were
an
old
schoolmate
of
your
mother
and
attempt
to
talk
to
me
about
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
rudolph
musgrave
you
might
at
least
have
started
a
little
at
seeing
me
and
have
clasped
your
hand
to
your
heart
and
have
said
you
or
something
of
the
sort
i
had
every
right
to
expect
it
charteris
pouted
and
then
trifled
for
a
moment
with
the
pages
of
her
book
and
and
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
am
sorry
for
the
way
i
spoke
to
you
that
night
she
swiftly
said
anne
did
not
look
at
him
women
do
understand
things
that
are
perfectly
simple
to
men
i
suppose
i
mean
that
is
jack
said
that
you
ought
to
apologize
it
was
very
like
him
and
colonel
musgrave
smiled
to
think
how
like
john
charteris
it
was
jack
is
quite
wonderful
he
observed
she
looked
up
saying
impulsively
rudolph
you
do
know
how
happy
he
makes
me
heartless
woman
and
would
you
tempt
me
to
end
the
tragedy
of
my
life
with
a
shakesperian
fifth
act
of
poisonings
and
assassination
i
spurn
you
temptress
for
after
all
it
was
an
unpleasantly
long
while
ago
we
went
mad
for
each
other
musgrave
announced
and
he
smiled
i
fancy
that
the
boy
and
girl
we
knew
of
are
as
dead
now
as
nebuchadnezzar
married
and
i
sit
here
alive
and
merry
at
well
not
at
forty
year
unluckily
if
you
continue
in
that
heartless
strain
i
shall
go
into
the
house
charteris
protested
her
indignation
was
exaggerated
but
it
was
not
altogether
feigned
women
can
not
quite
pardon
a
rejected
suitor
who
marries
and
is
content
they
wish
him
all
imaginable
happiness
and
prosperity
of
course
and
they
are
honestly
interested
in
his
welfare
but
it
seems
unexpectedly
callous
in
him
and
besides
his
wife
is
so
perfectly
commonplace
charteris
therefore
added
with
emphasis
i
am
really
disgracefully
happy
glad
to
hear
it
said
musgrave
placidly
so
am
i
oh
rudolph
rudolph
you
are
hopeless
she
sighed
and
you
used
to
make
such
a
nice
lover
charteris
looked
out
over
the
river
which
was
like
melting
gold
and
for
a
moment
was
silent
i
was
frightfully
in
love
with
you
rudolph
she
said
as
half
in
wonder
after
after
that
horrible
time
when
my
parents
forced
us
to
behave
rationally
i
wept
oh
i
must
have
wept
deluges
i
firmly
intended
to
pine
away
to
an
early
grave
and
that
second
time
i
liked
you
too
but
then
there
was
jack
you
see
h
said
colonel
musgrave
yes
i
see
i
want
you
to
continue
to
be
friends
with
jack
she
went
on
and
her
face
lighted
up
and
her
voice
grew
tender
he
has
the
artistic
temperament
and
naturally
that
makes
him
sensitive
and
a
trifle
irritable
at
times
it
takes
so
little
to
upset
him
you
see
for
he
feels
so
acutely
what
he
calls
the
discords
of
life
i
think
most
men
are
jealous
of
his
talents
so
they
call
him
selfish
and
finicky
and
conceited
he
is
really
you
know
only
he
ca
help
feeling
a
little
superior
to
the
majority
of
men
and
his
artistic
temperament
leads
him
to
magnify
the
lesser
mishaps
of
life
such
as
the
steak
being
overdone
or
missing
a
train
oh
really
a
thing
like
that
worries
him
as
much
as
the
loss
of
a
fortune
or
a
death
in
the
family
would
upset
anyone
else
jack
says
there
are
no
such
things
as
trifles
in
a
harmonious
and
life
and
i
suppose
that
true
to
men
of
genius
of
course
i
am
rather
a
philistine
and
i
grate
on
him
at
times
that
is
i
used
to
but
he
says
i
have
improved
wonderfully
and
so
we
are
ridiculously
happy
jack
and
i
musgrave
cast
about
vainly
for
an
appropriate
speech
then
he
compromised
with
his
conscience
and
said
your
husband
is
a
very
clever
man
is
he
she
had
flushed
for
pleasure
at
hearing
him
praised
oh
yes
anne
loved
jack
charteris
there
was
no
questioning
that
it
was
written
in
her
face
was
vibrant
in
her
voice
as
she
spoke
of
him
now
really
rudolph
are
his
books
wonderful
i
do
appreciate
them
of
course
for
i
not
clever
but
i
know
you
do
i
do
see
why
men
think
him
selfish
i
know
better
you
have
to
live
with
jack
to
really
appreciate
him
and
every
day
i
discover
some
new
side
of
his
character
that
makes
him
dearer
to
me
he
so
clever
and
so
noble
why
i
remember
well
before
jack
made
his
first
hit
with
he
lived
with
his
sister
they
had
any
money
and
of
course
jack
could
be
expected
to
take
a
clerkship
or
anything
like
that
because
business
details
make
his
head
ache
poor
boy
so
his
sister
taught
school
and
he
lived
with
her
they
were
very
happy
his
sister
simply
adores
him
and
i
am
positively
jealous
of
her
sometimes
but
unfortunately
the
bank
in
which
she
kept
her
money
failed
one
day
i
remember
it
was
just
before
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
and
told
me
in
his
dear
laughing
manner
that
he
had
a
penny
in
the
world
and
that
we
would
have
to
live
on
bread
and
cheese
and
kisses
of
course
i
had
a
plenty
for
us
both
though
so
we
really
in
danger
of
being
reduced
to
that
well
i
wanted
to
make
his
sister
an
allowance
but
jack
pointed
out
with
considerable
reason
that
one
person
could
live
very
comfortably
on
an
income
that
had
formerly
supported
two
he
said
it
was
right
i
should
be
burdened
with
the
support
of
his
family
jack
was
so
sensitive
you
see
lest
people
might
think
he
was
making
a
mercenary
marriage
and
that
his
sister
was
profiting
by
it
now
i
call
that
one
of
the
noblest
things
i
ever
heard
of
for
he
is
devotedly
attached
to
his
sister
and
naturally
it
is
a
great
grief
to
him
to
see
her
compelled
to
work
for
a
living
his
last
book
was
dedicated
to
her
and
the
dedication
is
one
of
the
most
tender
and
pathetic
things
i
ever
read
musgrave
was
hardly
conscious
of
what
she
was
saying
she
was
not
particularly
intelligent
this
handsome
cheery
woman
but
her
voice
and
the
richness
and
sweetness
of
it
and
the
vitality
of
her
laugh
contented
his
soul
anne
was
different
the
knowledge
came
again
to
him
quite
simply
that
anne
was
different
and
in
the
nature
of
things
must
always
be
a
little
different
from
all
other
people
even
patricia
musgrave
he
had
no
desire
to
tell
anne
charteris
of
this
no
idea
that
it
would
affect
in
any
way
the
tenor
of
his
life
he
merely
accepted
the
fact
that
she
was
after
all
anne
willoughby
and
that
her
dear
presence
seemed
somehow
to
strengthen
and
cheer
and
comfort
and
content
beyond
the
reach
of
expression
yet
musgrave
recognized
her
lack
of
cleverness
and
liked
and
admired
her
none
the
less
a
vision
of
patricia
arose
a
vision
of
a
dainty
shallow
face
with
a
surprising
quantity
of
vivid
hair
about
it
patricia
was
beautiful
and
patricia
was
clever
in
her
pinchbeck
way
but
rudolph
musgrave
doubted
very
much
if
her
mocking
eyes
now
ever
softened
into
that
brooding
sacred
tenderness
he
had
seen
in
anne
eyes
and
he
likewise
questioned
if
a
hurried
happy
thrill
ran
through
patricia
voice
when
patricia
spoke
of
her
husband
you
have
unquestionably
married
an
unusual
man
musgrave
said
i
by
jove
you
know
i
fancy
my
wife
finds
him
almost
as
attractive
as
you
do
ah
rudolph
i
ca
fancy
anyone
whom
whom
you
loved
caring
for
anyone
else
do
i
remember
sir
how
irresistible
you
can
be
when
you
choose
anne
laughed
and
raised
plump
hands
to
heaven
really
though
women
pursue
him
to
a
perfectly
indecent
extent
i
have
to
watch
over
him
carefully
not
that
i
distrust
him
of
course
for
dear
jack
he
is
so
devoted
to
me
and
cares
so
little
for
other
women
that
joseph
would
seem
in
comparison
only
a
depraved
but
the
why
rudolph
there
was
an
italian
countess
at
rome
the
impudent
minx
who
actually
made
me
believe
however
jack
explained
all
that
after
i
had
made
both
a
spectacle
and
a
nuisance
of
myself
and
he
had
behaved
so
nobly
in
the
entire
affair
that
for
days
afterwards
i
was
positively
limp
with
repentance
then
in
paris
that
flighty
hardress
but
he
explained
that
too
some
women
are
shameless
rudolph
charteris
concluded
and
sighed
her
pity
for
them
utterly
so
musgrave
assented
gravely
he
was
feeling
a
thought
uncomfortable
to
him
the
place
had
grown
portentous
the
sun
was
low
and
the
long
shadows
of
the
trees
were
black
on
the
dim
lawn
people
were
assembling
for
supper
and
passing
to
and
fro
under
branches
and
the
gowns
of
the
women
glimmered
through
a
faint
blue
haze
like
that
with
which
boucher
and
watteau
and
fragonard
loved
to
veil
and
thereby
to
make
wistful
somehow
the
antics
of
those
fine
manikins
who
figure
in
their
inside
the
house
someone
was
playing
an
unpleasant
sort
of
air
on
the
piano
an
air
which
was
quite
needlessly
creepy
and
haunting
and
insistent
it
all
seemed
like
a
grim
bit
out
of
a
play
the
tenderness
and
pride
that
shone
in
anne
eyes
as
she
boasted
of
her
happiness
troubled
rudolph
musgrave
he
had
a
perfectly
unreasonable
desire
to
carry
her
away
by
force
if
necessary
and
to
protect
her
from
clever
people
and
to
buy
things
for
her
so
i
am
an
old
old
married
woman
now
and
and
i
think
in
some
ways
i
suit
jack
better
than
a
more
brilliant
person
might
i
am
glad
your
wife
has
taken
a
fancy
to
him
and
i
want
you
to
profit
by
her
example
jack
says
she
is
one
of
the
most
attractive
women
he
ever
met
he
asked
me
why
i
did
do
my
hair
like
hers
she
must
make
you
very
happy
rudolph
my
wife
colonel
musgrave
said
is
in
my
partial
opinion
a
very
clever
and
very
beautiful
woman
yes
cleverness
and
beauty
are
sufficient
to
make
any
man
happy
i
suppose
anne
hazarded
jack
says
though
cleverness
and
beauty
the
main
things
in
life
rudolph
undoubtedly
he
protested
now
that
she
said
judicially
shows
the
difference
in
men
jack
says
a
man
loves
a
woman
not
for
her
beauty
or
any
other
quality
she
possesses
but
just
because
she
is
the
woman
he
loves
and
ca
help
loving
ah
i
dare
say
that
is
the
usual
reason
yes
said
colonel
musgrave
because
she
is
the
woman
he
loves
and
can
not
help
loving
anne
clapped
her
hands
ah
so
i
have
penetrated
your
indifference
at
last
sir
impulsively
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
spoke
with
earnestness
dear
rudolph
i
am
so
glad
you
found
the
woman
you
can
really
love
jack
says
there
is
only
one
possible
woman
in
the
world
for
each
man
and
that
only
in
a
month
of
sundays
does
he
find
her
yes
said
musgrave
he
had
risen
and
was
looking
down
in
friendly
fashion
into
her
honest
lovely
eyes
yes
there
is
only
one
possible
woman
and
yes
i
think
i
found
her
anne
some
years
ago
iii
thus
it
befell
that
all
passed
smoothly
with
rudolph
musgrave
and
anne
charteris
with
whom
he
was
not
in
the
least
in
love
any
longer
he
reflected
although
in
the
nature
of
things
she
must
always
seem
to
him
a
little
different
from
all
other
people
and
it
befell
too
that
the
following
noon
this
day
being
a
sunday
warm
clear
and
somnolent
anne
charteris
and
rudolph
musgrave
sat
upon
the
lawn
before
matocton
and
little
roger
musgrave
was
with
them
in
fact
these
two
had
been
by
this
small
despot
to
serve
against
an
enemy
then
harassing
his
majesty
equanimity
and
by
him
revilingly
designated
as
and
so
anne
made
for
roger
as
she
had
learned
to
do
for
her
dead
son
in
addition
to
a
respectable
navy
of
paper
boats
a
vast
number
of
boxes
and
nantucket
sinks
and
picture
frames
and
footballs
she
had
used
up
the
greater
part
of
a
magazine
before
the
imp
grew
tired
of
her
novel
accomplishments
for
as
he
invidiously
observed
i
can
make
them
for
myself
now
most
as
good
as
you
only
i
always
tear
the
bottom
of
the
boat
when
you
pull
it
out
and
my
sinks
are
kind
of
wobbly
and
besides
i
made
up
a
story
just
like
your
husband
gets
money
for
doing
and
if
i
had
a
quarter
i
would
buy
that
green
and
yellow
snake
in
the
window
and
wiggle
it
at
people
and
scare
them
into
fits
sonnikins
said
colonel
musgrave
suppose
you
tell
us
the
story
and
then
we
will
see
if
it
is
really
worth
a
quarter
and
try
to
save
you
from
this
unblushing
mendicancy
well
god
bless
father
and
mother
and
little
cousins
oh
no
what
i
say
at
night
roger
voice
now
altered
assuming
shrill
singsong
cadences
his
pensive
gravity
would
have
appeared
excessive
if
manifested
by
the
great
sphinx
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
once
upon
a
time
when
the
battle
of
gettysburg
was
going
on
and
houses
were
being
robbed
and
burned
and
my
dear
grandfather
was
being
shot
through
the
heart
a
certain
house
where
the
richest
man
in
town
lived
was
having
feast
and
merriment
never
dreaming
of
any
harm
or
thinking
of
their
little
child
rachel
who
was
on
the
front
porch
watching
the
battle
and
screaming
with
joy
at
every
man
that
fell
dead
one
man
was
struck
with
a
bullet
and
was
hurt
he
saw
the
child
laughing
at
him
and
his
heart
was
full
of
revenge
so
that
night
when
all
had
gone
to
bed
the
old
man
went
softly
in
the
house
and
got
the
little
girl
and
set
the
house
on
fire
and
he
carried
her
out
in
the
mountains
and
is
that
worth
a
quarter
good
heavens
no
said
anne
how
dare
you
leave
us
in
such
harrowing
suspense
well
a
whole
lot
more
happened
because
all
the
while
rachel
was
asleep
when
she
woke
up
she
did
not
know
where
under
the
sun
she
was
so
she
walked
along
for
about
an
hour
and
came
to
a
little
village
and
after
a
few
minutes
she
came
to
a
large
rock
and
guess
who
she
met
she
met
her
father
and
when
he
saw
her
he
hugged
her
so
hard
that
when
he
got
through
she
did
not
have
any
breath
left
in
her
and
they
walked
along
and
after
a
while
they
came
to
the
wood
and
it
was
now
about
six
and
it
was
very
dark
and
just
then
nine
robbers
jumped
out
from
behind
the
trees
and
they
took
a
pistol
and
shot
rachel
father
and
the
child
fainted
her
papa
was
dead
so
she
dug
a
hole
and
buried
him
and
went
right
back
home
and
of
course
that
was
all
and
if
i
had
that
snake
i
would
try
to
scare
you
with
it
father
anyhow
so
colonel
musgrave
gave
his
son
a
coin
as
the
colonel
considered
and
it
having
been
decreed
now
father
tell
a
story
obediently
read
aloud
from
a
fat
book
the
tale
was
of
the
colonel
selecting
and
it
dealt
with
a
shepherdess
and
a
and
so
the
colonel
perorated
the
little
china
people
remained
together
and
were
thankful
for
the
rivet
in
grandfather
neck
and
continued
to
love
each
other
until
they
were
broken
to
pieces
and
the
tale
is
a
parable
my
son
you
will
find
that
out
some
day
i
wish
you
did
have
to
but
is
that
all
father
you
will
find
it
rather
more
than
enough
sonnikins
when
you
begin
to
interpret
yes
that
is
all
only
you
are
to
remember
always
that
they
climbed
to
the
very
top
of
the
chimney
where
they
could
see
the
stars
before
they
decided
to
go
back
and
live
upon
the
parlor
table
under
the
for
the
stars
are
disconcertingly
unconcerned
when
you
have
climbed
to
them
and
so
altogether
unimpressed
by
your
achievement
that
it
is
the
nature
of
all
china
people
to
slink
home
again
precisely
as
your
rachel
did
and
as
charteris
will
assure
you
i
said
anne
now
honestly
rudolph
i
was
thinking
you
ought
not
to
let
him
sit
upon
the
grass
because
he
really
has
a
cold
and
if
i
were
you
i
would
give
him
a
good
dose
of
some
people
give
it
in
i
know
but
i
found
with
my
boy
that
peppermint
is
rather
less
disagreeable
and
you
could
easily
send
somebody
over
to
the
store
at
the
station
anne
broke
off
short
was
i
being
inadequate
again
i
am
sorry
but
with
children
you
never
know
what
a
cold
may
lead
to
and
i
really
do
not
believe
it
good
for
him
to
sit
in
this
damp
grass
sonnikins
said
rudolph
musgrave
you
had
better
climb
up
into
my
lap
before
you
and
i
are
podsnapped
from
the
universe
by
the
only
embodiment
of
just
now
within
our
reach
he
patted
the
boy
head
and
latterly
resumed
i
am
afraid
of
you
anne
whenever
i
am
imagining
vain
things
or
stitching
romantic
possibilities
like
embroideries
about
the
fabric
of
my
past
i
always
find
the
real
you
in
my
path
as
undeniable
as
a
i
believe
you
ever
dare
to
think
because
there
is
no
telling
what
it
might
lead
to
you
are
simply
unassailably
armored
by
the
courage
of
other
people
convictions
her
candid
eyes
met
his
over
the
boy
bright
head
and
what
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
i
am
lamenting
i
am
rending
the
air
and
beating
my
breast
on
account
of
your
obstinate
preference
for
being
always
in
the
right
i
do
wish
you
would
endeavor
to
impersonate
a
human
being
a
trifle
more
convincingly
but
the
great
gong
booming
out
for
luncheon
interrupted
him
at
this
point
and
colonel
musgrave
was
never
permitted
to
finish
his
complaint
against
anne
unimaginativeness
iv
on
that
same
sunday
morning
while
anne
charteris
and
rudolph
musgrave
contended
with
little
roger
boredom
on
the
lawn
before
matocton
patricia
and
charteris
met
by
accident
on
the
seventh
terrace
of
the
gardens
patricia
had
mentioned
casually
at
the
that
she
intended
to
spend
the
forenoon
on
this
terrace
unsabbatically
making
notes
for
a
paper
on
the
symbolism
of
dante
which
she
was
to
read
before
the
lichfield
woman
club
in
october
but
charteris
had
not
overheard
her
he
was
seated
on
the
front
porch
working
out
a
somewhat
difficult
point
in
his
new
book
when
it
had
first
occurred
to
him
that
this
particular
terrace
would
be
an
inspiring
and
appropriate
place
in
which
to
think
the
matter
over
undisturbed
he
said
and
it
was
impossible
he
should
have
known
that
anyone
was
there
as
the
seventh
terrace
happens
to
be
the
only
one
that
being
planted
with
is
completely
screened
from
observation
from
the
house
you
can
not
see
anything
that
happens
there
it
was
a
curious
accident
though
it
really
seemed
now
that
patricia
had
put
an
ending
to
their
meetings
in
the
fate
was
conspiring
to
bring
them
together
however
as
charteris
pointed
out
there
could
be
no
possible
objection
to
this
conspiracy
since
they
had
decided
that
their
friendship
was
to
be
of
a
purely
platonic
nature
it
was
a
severe
trial
to
him
he
confessed
to
be
forced
to
put
aside
certain
dreams
he
had
had
of
the
future
mad
dreams
perhaps
but
such
as
had
seemed
very
dear
and
very
plausible
to
his
impractical
artistic
temperament
still
it
heartened
him
to
hope
that
their
friendship
since
it
was
to
be
no
more
might
prove
a
survival
or
rather
a
veritable
renaissance
of
the
beautiful
old
greek
spirit
in
such
matters
and
though
the
blind
chance
that
mismanaged
the
world
had
chained
them
to
uncongenial
though
certainly
persons
this
was
no
logical
reason
why
he
and
patricia
should
be
deprived
of
the
pleasures
of
intellectual
intercourse
their
souls
were
too
closely
akin
for
charteris
admitted
that
his
soul
was
grecian
to
the
core
and
out
of
place
and
puzzled
and
very
lonely
in
a
sordid
bustling
world
and
he
assured
patricia
she
did
not
object
if
he
called
her
patricia
that
her
own
soul
possessed
all
the
beauty
and
purity
and
calm
of
an
aphrodite
sculptured
by
phidias
it
was
such
a
soul
as
horace
might
have
loved
as
theocritus
might
have
hymned
in
glad
greek
song
patricia
flushed
and
dissented
somewhat
frankly
she
said
you
are
far
too
attractive
for
your
company
to
be
quite
safe
you
are
such
an
adept
in
the
nameless
little
attentions
that
women
love
so
profuse
with
lesser
of
speech
and
action
that
after
two
weeks
one
husband
is
really
necessary
as
an
antidote
are
good
but
like
all
palatable
things
unwholesome
so
i
shall
prescribe
rudolph
company
for
myself
to
ward
off
an
attack
of
moral
indigestion
i
am
very
glad
he
has
come
back
really
glad
she
added
conscientiously
poor
old
rudolph
what
between
his
interminable
antiquities
and
those
demented
sections
of
the
alphabet
what
are
those
things
that
are
always
going
up
and
down
in
wall
street
elevators
charteris
suggested
oh
you
i
mean
those
and
and
those
other
letters
that
are
always
having
flurries
and
panics
and
passed
dividends
they
keep
him
incredibly
busy
and
she
sighed
tolerantly
patricia
had
come
within
the
last
two
weeks
to
believe
that
she
was
neglected
if
not
positively
by
her
husband
and
she
had
no
earthly
objection
to
charteris
thinking
likewise
her
face
expressed
patient
resignation
now
as
they
walked
under
the
foliage
of
the
which
made
a
pleasant
gloom
about
them
patricia
removed
her
hat
the
morning
really
was
rather
close
and
paused
where
a
sunbeam
fell
upon
her
hair
and
glorified
her
wistful
countenance
she
sighed
once
more
and
added
a
finishing
touch
to
the
portrait
of
a
pray
do
think
she
said
very
earnestly
that
i
am
blaming
rudolph
i
suppose
no
wife
can
ever
hope
to
have
any
part
in
her
husband
inner
life
not
in
her
own
husband
of
course
said
charteris
cryptically
no
for
while
a
woman
gives
her
heart
all
at
once
men
crumble
theirs
away
as
one
feeds
bread
to
birds
a
crumb
to
this
woman
a
crumb
to
that
and
such
a
little
crumb
sometimes
and
his
wife
gets
what
is
left
over
pray
where
did
you
read
that
said
charteris
i
did
read
it
anywhere
it
was
simply
a
thought
that
came
to
me
patricia
lied
gently
but
do
let
try
to
be
clever
cleverness
is
always
a
tax
but
before
luncheon
it
is
an
extortion
personally
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
had
attended
a
supper
the
night
before
your
wife
must
be
very
patient
my
wife
cried
charteris
in
turn
resolved
to
screen
an
unappreciative
mate
is
the
most
dear
and
most
among
the
philistines
and
yet
at
times
i
grant
you
oh
but
of
course
patricia
said
impatiently
i
do
for
a
moment
question
that
your
wife
is
an
angel
and
why
his
eyebrows
lifted
and
he
smiled
why
was
it
an
angel
patricia
queried
all
impishness
now
who
kept
the
first
man
and
woman
out
of
paradise
if
if
i
thought
you
meant
that
he
cried
and
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
my
wife
virtues
merit
a
better
husband
than
fate
has
accorded
her
anne
is
the
best
woman
i
have
ever
known
patricia
was
not
unnaturally
irritated
after
all
one
does
not
take
the
trouble
to
meet
a
man
accidentally
in
a
plantation
of
young
in
order
to
hear
him
discourse
of
his
wife
good
qualities
and
besides
charteris
was
speaking
in
a
disagreeably
solemn
manner
rather
as
if
he
fancied
himself
in
a
cathedral
therefore
patricia
cast
down
her
eyes
again
and
said
men
of
genius
are
so
rarely
understood
by
their
wives
we
will
waive
the
question
of
genius
charteris
laughed
heartily
but
he
had
flushed
with
pleasure
i
suppose
he
continued
pacing
up
and
down
with
fervor
that
matrimony
is
always
more
or
less
of
a
compromise
like
two
convicts
chained
together
trying
to
catch
each
other
gait
after
a
while
they
succeed
to
a
certain
extent
the
chain
is
still
heavy
of
course
but
it
does
not
gall
them
as
poignantly
as
it
used
to
do
and
i
fear
the
artistic
temperament
is
not
suited
to
marriage
its
capacity
for
suffering
is
too
great
charteris
caught
his
breath
in
shuddering
fashion
and
he
paused
before
patricia
after
a
moment
he
grasped
her
by
both
wrists
we
are
chained
fast
enough
my
lady
he
cried
bitterly
and
our
sentence
is
for
life
there
are
green
fields
yonder
but
our
allotted
place
is
here
in
the
there
is
laughter
yonder
in
the
fields
and
the
scent
of
wild
flowers
floats
in
to
us
at
times
when
we
are
weary
and
the
whispering
trees
sway
their
branches
over
the
and
their
fruit
is
good
to
look
on
and
they
hang
within
reach
ah
we
might
reach
them
very
easily
but
this
is
forbidden
fruit
my
lady
and
it
is
not
included
in
our
wholesome
and
so
do
think
of
it
we
have
been
happy
you
and
i
for
a
little
we
might
do
think
of
it
do
dare
think
of
it
go
back
and
help
your
husband
drag
his
chain
it
galls
him
as
sorely
as
it
does
you
it
galls
us
all
it
is
the
heaviest
chain
was
ever
forged
but
we
do
not
dare
shake
it
off
i
oh
jack
jack
do
you
dare
to
talk
to
me
like
that
we
must
be
brave
we
must
be
sensible
patricia
regardless
of
her
skirts
sat
down
upon
the
ground
and
produced
a
i
oh
what
do
you
mean
by
making
me
so
unhappy
she
demanded
indignantly
ah
patricia
he
murmured
as
he
knelt
beside
her
how
can
you
hope
to
have
a
man
ever
talk
to
you
in
a
sane
fashion
you
should
have
such
eyes
patricia
they
are
purple
and
fathomless
like
the
ocean
and
when
a
man
looks
into
them
too
long
his
sanity
grows
weak
and
sinks
and
drowns
in
their
cool
depths
and
the
man
must
babble
out
his
foolish
heart
to
you
oh
but
indeed
you
should
have
such
eyes
patricia
they
are
dangerous
and
to
ask
anybody
to
believe
in
their
splendor
is
an
insult
to
his
intelligence
and
besides
they
are
much
too
bright
to
wear
in
the
morning
they
are
bad
form
patricia
we
must
be
sensible
she
babbled
your
wife
is
here
my
husband
is
here
and
we
we
are
children
or
madmen
jack
dear
so
we
really
must
be
sensible
i
suppose
oh
jack
she
cried
upon
a
sudden
this
honorable
why
no
poor
little
anne
charteris
eyes
grew
tender
for
a
moment
because
his
wife
in
a
fashion
was
dear
to
him
then
he
laughed
very
musically
and
how
can
a
man
remember
honor
patricia
when
the
choice
lies
between
honor
and
you
you
should
have
such
hair
patricia
it
is
a
net
spun
out
of
the
raw
stuff
of
fire
and
blood
and
of
portentous
sunsets
and
its
tendrils
have
curled
around
what
little
honor
i
ever
boasted
and
they
hold
it
fast
patricia
it
is
dishonorable
to
love
you
but
i
can
not
think
of
that
when
i
am
with
you
and
hear
you
speak
and
when
i
am
not
with
you
just
to
remember
that
dear
voice
is
enough
to
set
my
pulses
beating
faster
oh
patricia
you
should
have
such
a
voice
charteris
broke
off
in
speech
me
for
interruptin
the
old
mulattress
virginia
was
saying
but
mis
pilkins
sen
me
say
lunch
raydy
miss
patrisy
virginia
seemed
to
notice
nothing
having
delivered
her
message
she
went
away
quietly
her
pleasant
yellow
face
as
imperturbable
as
an
idol
but
patricia
shivered
she
frightens
me
yes
that
old
woman
always
gives
me
gooseflesh
and
i
do
know
why
because
she
is
as
deaf
as
a
post
and
i
simply
ca
get
rid
of
her
she
is
a
sort
of
symbol
she
and
how
many
others
i
wonder
oh
well
let
hurry
so
charteris
was
never
permitted
to
finish
his
complaint
against
patricia
voice
it
was
absolutely
imperative
they
should
be
on
time
for
luncheon
for
as
patricia
pointed
out
the
majority
of
people
are
censorious
and
lose
no
opportunity
for
saying
nasty
things
they
are
even
capable
of
sneering
at
a
purely
platonic
friendship
which
is
attempting
to
preserve
the
beautiful
old
greek
spirit
she
was
chattering
either
of
her
plans
for
the
autumn
or
of
dante
and
the
discovery
of
his
missing
cantos
or
else
of
how
abominably
bob
townsend
had
treated
rosalind
jemmett
and
they
had
almost
reached
the
upper
terrace
little
roger
indeed
his
red
head
blazing
in
the
sunlight
was
already
sidling
by
shy
instalments
toward
them
when
patricia
moaned
inconsequently
and
for
no
ascertainable
cause
fainted
it
was
the
first
time
for
four
years
she
had
been
guilty
of
such
an
indiscretion
she
was
shortly
afterward
explaining
to
various
members
of
the
musgraves
it
was
the
heat
no
doubt
but
since
everybody
insisted
upon
it
she
would
very
willingly
toast
them
in
another
bumper
of
aromatic
spirits
of
ammonia
just
look
at
that
rudolph
you
spilt
it
all
over
your
coat
sleeve
i
do
wish
you
would
try
to
be
a
little
less
clumsy
oh
well
i
spruce
as
a
new
penny
now
so
let
all
go
to
luncheon
v
patricia
had
not
been
in
perfect
health
for
a
long
while
it
seemed
to
her
in
retrospect
that
ever
since
the
agonies
of
little
roger
birth
she
had
been
the
victim
of
what
she
described
as
a
sort
of
then
too
as
has
been
previously
recorded
patricia
had
been
operated
upon
by
surgeons
and
more
than
once
good
lord
as
she
herself
declared
it
has
reached
the
point
that
when
i
see
a
turkey
coming
to
the
to
be
carved
i
ca
help
treating
it
as
an
ingénue
yet
for
the
last
four
years
she
had
never
fainted
until
this
it
disquieted
her
then
too
awoke
faint
pricking
memories
of
certain
symptoms
which
she
had
not
talked
about
now
they
alarmed
her
and
in
consequence
she
took
the
next
train
to
lichfield
vi
ashmeade
who
has
been
previously
quoted
now
comes
into
the
story
she
is
only
an
episode
still
her
intervention
led
to
peculiar
results
results
curiously
enough
in
which
she
was
not
in
the
least
concerned
she
simply
comes
into
the
story
for
a
moment
and
then
goes
out
of
it
but
her
part
is
an
important
one
she
is
like
the
watchman
who
announces
the
coming
of
agamemnon
clytemnestra
sharpens
her
ax
at
the
news
and
the
fatal
bath
is
prepared
for
the
the
tragedy
moves
on
the
house
of
atreus
falls
and
the
wrath
of
implacable
gods
bellows
across
the
heavens
meanwhile
the
watchman
has
gone
home
to
have
tea
with
his
family
and
we
hear
no
more
of
him
there
are
any
number
of
morals
to
this
ashmeade
comes
into
the
story
on
the
day
patricia
went
to
lichfield
and
some
weeks
after
john
charteris
arrival
at
matocton
since
then
affairs
had
progressed
in
a
not
unnatural
sequence
charteris
as
we
have
seen
attributed
it
to
fate
and
assuredly
there
must
be
a
special
providence
of
some
kind
that
presides
over
country
houses
a
freakish
and
whimsical
providence
which
hugely
rejoices
in
confounding
one
sense
of
time
and
direction
through
its
agency
people
unaccountably
lose
their
way
in
the
simplest
walks
and
turn
up
late
and
embarrassed
for
luncheon
at
the
end
of
the
evening
it
brings
any
number
of
couples
blinking
out
of
the
dark
with
no
idea
the
clock
was
striking
more
than
nine
and
it
delights
in
sending
one
into
the
garden
in
search
of
roses
or
dahlias
or
or
something
of
the
sort
of
course
and
thereby
causing
one
to
encounter
the
most
unlikely
people
and
really
quite
the
last
person
one
would
have
thought
of
meeting
as
all
frequenters
of
junketings
will
assure
you
and
thus
is
this
special
providence
responsible
for
a
great
number
of
marriages
and
it
may
be
for
a
large
percentage
of
the
divorce
cases
for
if
you
desire
very
heartily
to
see
anything
of
another
member
of
a
this
and
providence
will
somehow
always
bring
the
event
about
in
a
specious
manner
and
without
any
apparent
thought
of
the
consequences
and
the
musgraves
was
no
exception
ashmeade
for
reasons
of
her
own
took
daily
note
of
this
the
others
were
largely
engrossed
by
their
own
affairs
they
did
not
seriously
concern
themselves
about
the
doings
of
their
and
besides
if
john
charteris
manifestly
sought
the
company
of
patricia
musgrave
her
husband
did
not
appear
to
be
exorbitantly
dissatisfied
or
angry
or
even
lonely
and
be
this
as
it
might
the
fact
remained
that
celia
reindan
was
at
this
time
more
than
a
little
interested
in
teddy
anstruther
and
felix
kennaston
was
undeniably
very
attentive
to
kathleen
saumarez
and
tom
gelwix
was
quite
certainly
devoting
the
major
part
of
his
existence
to
sitting
upon
the
beach
with
rosalind
jemmett
for
in
lichfield
at
all
events
everyone
house
has
at
least
a
pane
or
so
of
glass
in
it
and
if
indiscriminate
were
ever
to
become
the
fashion
there
is
really
no
telling
what
damage
might
ensue
and
so
had
ashmeade
been
a
younger
woman
had
time
and
an
adoring
husband
not
rendered
her
as
immune
to
an
insanity
as
any
of
us
may
hope
to
be
upon
this
side
of
saintship
or
senility
why
ashmeade
would
most
probably
have
remained
passive
and
ashmeade
would
never
have
come
into
this
story
at
all
as
it
was
she
approached
rudolph
musgrave
with
a
fixed
purpose
this
morning
as
he
smoked
an
cigarette
on
the
front
porch
of
matocton
and
rudolph
said
ashmeade
are
you
blind
you
mean
he
asked
and
he
broke
off
for
he
had
really
no
conception
of
what
she
meant
and
ashmeade
said
i
mean
patricia
and
charteris
did
you
think
i
was
by
any
chance
referring
to
the
man
in
the
moon
and
the
queen
of
sheba
if
ever
amazement
showed
in
a
man
eyes
it
shone
now
in
rudolph
musgrave
after
a
little
the
pupils
widened
in
a
sort
of
terror
so
this
was
what
clarice
pendomer
had
been
hinting
at
nonsense
he
cried
why
why
it
is
utter
preposterous
bedlamite
nonsense
he
caught
his
breath
in
wonder
at
the
notion
of
such
a
jest
remembering
a
little
packet
of
letters
hidden
in
his
desk
it
oh
no
fate
has
quite
so
fine
a
sense
of
humor
as
that
the
thing
is
incredible
musgrave
laughed
and
flushed
i
mean
i
do
think
you
need
tell
me
what
you
mean
said
ashmeade
she
sat
down
in
a
large
and
fanned
herself
for
the
day
was
warm
of
course
it
is
officious
and
presumptuous
and
disagreeable
of
me
to
meddle
i
do
mind
your
thinking
that
but
rudolph
do
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
fate
ever
misses
a
chance
of
humiliating
us
by
showing
how
poor
are
our
imaginations
the
gipsy
never
does
she
is
a
posturing
mountebank
who
thrives
by
astounding
humanity
ashmeade
paused
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
memories
and
very
wise
i
am
only
a
at
the
tragic
farce
that
is
being
played
here
she
continued
after
a
little
but
you
know
see
most
of
the
game
they
are
not
playing
fairly
with
you
rudolph
when
people
set
about
an
infringement
of
the
decalogue
they
owe
it
to
their
to
treat
with
heaven
as
a
formidable
antagonist
to
mark
the
cards
is
not
enough
they
are
not
playing
fairly
my
dear
and
you
ought
to
know
it
he
walked
up
and
down
the
porch
once
or
twice
with
his
hands
behind
him
then
he
stopped
before
ashmeade
and
smiled
down
at
her
without
many
locusts
shrilled
monotonously
no
i
do
not
think
you
are
officious
or
meddling
or
anything
of
the
sort
i
think
you
are
one
of
the
best
and
women
in
the
world
but
bless
your
motherly
soul
polly
the
thing
is
utterly
preposterous
of
course
patricia
is
young
and
likes
attention
and
it
pleases
her
to
have
men
admire
her
that
polly
is
perfectly
natural
why
you
would
expect
her
to
sit
around
under
the
trees
and
read
poetry
with
her
own
husband
would
you
we
have
been
married
far
too
long
for
that
patricia
and
i
she
thinks
me
rather
prosy
and
stupid
at
times
poor
girl
because
well
because
in
point
of
fact
i
am
but
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
oh
it
preposterous
we
are
the
best
friends
in
the
world
i
tell
you
it
is
simply
that
she
and
jack
have
a
great
deal
in
common
you
do
understand
john
charteris
i
do
said
ashmeade
placidly
charteris
is
simply
a
baby
with
a
vocabulary
his
moral
standpoint
is
entirely
that
of
infancy
it
would
be
ludicrous
to
describe
him
as
selfish
because
he
is
selfishness
incarnate
i
sometimes
believe
it
is
the
only
characteristic
the
man
possesses
he
reaches
out
his
hand
and
takes
whatever
he
wants
just
as
a
baby
would
quite
simply
and
as
a
matter
of
course
he
wants
your
wife
now
and
he
is
reaching
out
his
hand
to
take
her
he
probably
is
conscious
of
doing
anything
especially
wrong
he
is
always
so
plausible
in
whatever
he
does
that
he
ends
by
deceiving
himself
i
suppose
for
he
is
always
plausible
it
is
worse
than
useless
to
argue
any
matter
with
him
because
he
invariably
ends
by
making
you
feel
as
if
you
had
been
caught
stealing
a
hat
the
only
argument
that
would
get
the
better
of
john
charteris
is
knocking
him
down
just
as
spanking
is
the
only
argument
which
ever
gets
the
better
of
a
baby
yes
he
is
very
like
a
baby
thoroughly
selfish
and
thoroughly
dependent
on
other
people
only
he
is
a
clever
baby
who
exaggerates
his
own
helplessness
in
order
to
appeal
to
women
he
has
a
taste
for
women
and
women
naturally
like
him
for
he
impresses
them
as
an
irresponsible
child
astray
in
an
artful
and
designing
world
they
want
to
protect
him
even
i
do
at
times
it
is
really
maternal
you
know
we
would
infinitely
prefer
for
him
to
be
soft
and
little
so
that
we
could
pick
him
up
and
cuddle
him
but
as
it
is
he
is
dangerous
he
believes
whatever
he
tells
himself
you
see
her
voice
died
away
and
ashmeade
fanned
herself
in
the
fashion
addicted
by
perturbed
women
who
nevertheless
mean
to
have
their
say
out
slowly
and
impersonally
and
quite
as
if
she
was
fanning
some
one
else
through
motives
of
charity
i
do
question
musgrave
said
at
length
that
jack
is
the
highly
estimable
character
you
describe
but
oh
it
is
all
nonsense
polly
he
cried
with
petulance
and
with
a
tinge
if
but
the
merest
nuance
of
conviction
lacking
in
his
voice
the
fan
continued
its
majestic
sweep
from
the
shade
into
the
sunlight
and
back
again
into
the
shadow
without
many
locusts
shrilled
monotonously
rudolph
i
know
what
you
meant
by
saying
that
fate
had
such
a
fine
sense
of
humor
my
dear
madam
it
was
simply
thrown
out
in
the
heat
of
conversation
as
an
axiom
for
a
moment
the
fan
paused
then
went
on
as
before
it
was
never
charged
against
pauline
ashmeade
whatever
her
shortcomings
that
she
was
given
to
unnecessary
verbiage
colonel
musgrave
was
striding
up
and
down
divided
between
a
disposition
to
swear
at
the
universe
at
large
and
a
desire
to
laugh
at
it
somehow
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
doubt
what
she
had
told
him
he
comprehended
now
that
chafing
under
his
indebtedness
in
the
affair
of
pendomer
charteris
would
most
naturally
retaliate
by
making
love
to
his
benefactor
wife
because
the
colonel
also
knew
john
charteris
and
for
the
rest
it
was
useless
to
struggle
against
a
fate
that
planned
such
preposterous
and
elaborate
jokes
one
might
more
rationally
depend
on
fate
to
work
out
some
both
ludicrous
and
horrible
solution
he
reflected
remembering
a
little
packet
of
letters
hidden
in
his
desk
nevertheless
he
paused
after
a
while
and
laughed
with
a
tolerable
affectation
of
mirth
i
say
i
and
what
in
heaven
name
polly
prompted
you
to
bring
me
this
choice
specimen
of
a
because
i
am
fond
of
you
i
suppose
is
one
always
privileged
to
be
disagreeable
to
one
friends
we
have
been
friends
a
long
while
you
know
ashmeade
was
looking
out
over
the
river
now
but
she
seemed
to
see
a
great
way
a
very
great
way
beyond
its
glaring
waters
and
to
be
rather
uncertain
as
to
whether
what
she
beheld
there
was
of
a
humorous
or
pathetic
nature
rudolph
do
you
remember
that
evening
the
first
summer
that
i
knew
you
at
fortress
monroe
when
we
sat
upon
the
pier
so
frightfully
late
and
the
moon
rose
out
of
the
bay
and
made
a
great
silver
path
that
led
straight
over
the
rim
of
the
world
and
you
talked
to
me
about
about
what
now
oh
yes
yes
i
remember
perfectly
one
of
the
most
beautiful
evenings
i
ever
saw
i
remember
it
quite
distinctly
i
talked
i
and
what
in
the
lord
name
did
i
talk
about
polly
ah
men
forget
a
woman
never
forgets
when
she
is
really
friends
with
a
man
i
know
now
you
were
telling
me
about
anne
charteris
for
you
have
been
in
love
with
her
all
your
life
rudolph
in
your
own
particular
and
dawdling
fashion
perhaps
that
is
why
you
have
had
so
many
affairs
you
plainly
found
the
run
of
women
so
unimportant
that
it
put
every
woman
on
her
pride
to
prove
she
was
different
yes
i
remember
but
that
night
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
make
love
to
me
and
i
was
disappointed
in
you
and
yes
rather
pleased
women
are
all
vain
and
perfectly
inconsistent
but
then
always
take
after
their
fathers
ashmeade
rose
from
her
chair
her
fan
shut
with
a
snap
you
were
a
dear
boy
rudolph
when
i
first
knew
you
and
what
i
liked
was
that
you
never
made
love
to
me
of
all
the
boys
i
have
known
and
helped
to
form
you
were
the
only
sensible
one
the
only
one
who
never
presumed
that
was
rather
clever
of
you
rudolph
it
would
have
been
ridiculous
for
even
arithmetically
i
am
older
than
you
would
it
have
been
ridiculous
rudolph
she
demanded
suddenly
not
in
the
least
musgrave
protested
in
courteous
wise
you
why
polly
you
were
a
wonderfully
handsome
woman
any
boy
oh
yes
i
was
i
not
now
am
i
rudolph
ashmeade
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
naturally
ah
dear
boy
that
was
it
is
unfair
is
it
for
an
old
woman
to
seize
upon
you
in
this
fashion
and
insist
on
your
making
love
to
her
but
i
will
let
you
off
you
do
have
to
do
it
she
caught
her
skirts
in
her
left
hand
preparatory
to
going
and
her
right
hand
rested
lightly
on
his
arm
she
spoke
in
a
rather
peculiar
voice
yes
she
said
the
boy
was
a
very
very
dear
boy
and
i
want
the
man
to
be
equally
brave
and
sensible
musgrave
stared
after
her
i
wonder
i
wonder
oh
no
that
could
be
he
said
and
wearily
there
must
be
some
preposterous
situations
that
do
come
about
and
afterward
he
strolled
across
the
lawn
where
the
locusts
were
shrilling
as
if
in
a
stubborn
prediction
of
something
which
was
inevitable
and
he
meditated
upon
a
great
number
of
things
there
were
a
host
of
fleecy
little
clouds
in
the
sky
he
looked
up
at
them
interrogatively
and
then
he
smiled
and
shook
his
head
yet
i
do
know
said
he
for
i
am
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
world
is
run
on
an
extremely
humorous
basis
and
oddly
enough
it
was
at
the
same
moment
that
patricia
in
lichfield
reached
the
same
conclusion
part

are

paul
vanderhoffen
i
the
doctor
smelt
strongly
of
antiseptics
that
was
patricia
predominating
thought
as
she
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
apartment
she
fingered
its
dusty
furniture
she
remembered
afterward
the
of
jefferson
davis
and
his
cabinet
with
general
lee
explaining
some
evidently
important
matter
to
those
attentive
and
unhumanly
stiff
politicians
and
she
remembered
too
how
in
depicting
one
statesman
who
unavoidably
sat
with
his
back
to
the
spectator
the
artist
had
exceeded
anatomical
possibilities
in
order
to
obtain
a
recognizable
portrait
yet
at
the
time
this
picture
had
not
roused
her
conscious
attention
she
went
presently
to
the
long
table
austerely
decorated
with
two
rows
of
magazines
each
partly
covered
by
its
neighbor
just
as
shingles
are
placed
the
arrangement
irritated
her
unreasonably
she
wanted
to
disarrange
these
pamphlets
to
throw
them
on
the
floor
to
destroy
them
she
wondered
how
many
other
miserable
people
had
tried
to
read
these
hateful
books
while
they
waited
in
this
abominable
room
she
started
when
the
door
of
the
opened
the
doctor
was
patting
the
silk
glove
of
a
woman
in
black
as
he
escorted
her
to
the
outer
door
and
was
assuring
her
that
everything
was
going
very
well
indeed
and
that
she
was
not
to
worry
and
so
on
and
presently
he
spoke
with
patricia
for
a
long
while
quite
levelly
of
matters
which
it
is
not
suitable
to
record
discreet
man
that
he
was
wendell
pemberton
could
not
entirely
conceal
his
wonder
that
patricia
should
have
remained
so
long
in
ignorance
of
her
condition
he
spoke
concerning
malformation
and
functional
weaknesses
and
although
obscurely
because
of
the
bugbear
of
professional
courtesy
voiced
his
opinion
that
patricia
had
not
received
the
most
adroit
medical
treatment
at
the
time
of
little
roger
birth
she
was
dividedly
conscious
of
a
desire
to
laugh
and
of
the
notion
that
she
must
remain
outwardly
serious
because
though
this
horrible
pemberton
man
was
talking
abject
nonsense
she
would
presently
be
having
him
as
a
but
what
if
he
were
not
talking
nonsense
the
possibility
considered
roused
a
sensation
of
falling
through
infinity
yes
yes
patricia
civilly
assented
these
young
doctors
have
taken
this
out
of
me
and
that
out
of
me
as
you
might
take
the
works
out
of
a
watch
and
it
has
done
no
good
and
they
were
mistaken
in
their
first
diagnoses
because
what
they
took
for
true
osteomalacia
was
only
would
you
mind
telling
me
again
oh
yes
i
had
only
a
rhachitic
pelvis
to
begin
with
to
think
of
anybody
being
mistaken
about
a
simple
little
trouble
like
that
and
i
suppose
i
was
just
born
with
it
like
my
mother
and
all
those
other
luckless
women
with
musgrave
blood
in
them
fehling
and
schliephake
at
least
consider
this
variety
of
pelvic
anomaly
to
be
congenital
in
the
majority
of
cases
but
without
going
into
the
question
of
heredity
at
all
i
think
it
only
fair
to
tell
you
musgrave
and
pemberton
went
on
talking
neither
of
the
two
showed
any
emotion
the
doctor
went
on
talking
patricia
did
not
listen
the
man
was
talking
she
comprehended
but
to
her
his
words
seemed
blurred
and
indistinguishable
like
a
when
it
is
wound
up
enough
she
decided
subconsciously
patricia
was
thinking
you
have
two
big
beads
of
perspiration
on
your
nose
and
if
i
were
to
allude
to
the
fact
you
would
very
probably
die
of
embarrassment
aloud
patricia
said
you
mean
then
that
to
cap
it
all
a
functional
disorder
of
my
heart
has
become
organic
so
that
i
would
inevitably
die
under
another
operation
or
even
at
a
sudden
shock
and
that
particular
operation
is
now
the
solitary
chance
of
saving
my
life
the
dilemma
is
neat
is
it
how
god
must
laugh
at
the
jokes
he
contrives
said
patricia
i
wish
that
i
could
laugh
and
i
will
i
do
care
whether
you
think
me
a
reprobate
or
not
pemberton
i
want
a
good
stiff
drink
of
whiskey
the
musgrave
size
he
gave
it
to
her
ii
patricia
had
as
yet
an
hour
to
spend
in
lichfield
before
her
train
left
she
passed
it
in
the
garden
of
her
own
home
where
she
had
first
seen
rudolph
musgrave
and
he
had
fought
with
pevensey
all
that
seemed
very
long
ago
the
dahlia
leaves
she
noticed
were
edged
with
yellow
she
must
look
to
it
that
the
place
was
more
frequently
watered
and
that
the
bulbs
were
dug
up
in
september
next
year
she
meant
to
set
the
dahlias
thinly
like
a
hedge
oh
yes
i
meant
to
only
i
wo
be
alive
next
year
she
recollected
she
went
about
the
garden
to
see
if
ned
had
weeded
out
the
vines
a
pest
which
had
invaded
the
trim
place
lately
only
a
few
of
the
intruders
remained
and
withered
as
they
are
annually
by
the
sun
there
would
be
no
more
fight
until
next
april
oh
and
i
have
prayed
to
you
i
have
always
tried
to
do
what
you
wanted
and
i
never
asked
you
to
let
me
be
born
locked
up
in
a
musgrave
body
and
you
wo
even
let
me
see
a
vine
again
that
is
much
to
ask
i
think
but
you
wo
let
me
do
it
you
really
do
have
rather
funny
notions
about
your
jokes
she
began
to
laugh
oh
very
well
patricia
said
aloud
it
is
none
of
my
affair
that
you
elect
to
run
your
world
on
an
extremely
humorous
basis
she
was
at
matocton
in
good
time
for
luncheon
iii
colonel
musgrave
had
a
brief
interview
with
his
wife
after
luncheon
he
began
with
quiet
remonstrance
and
ended
with
an
unheard
extenuation
of
his
presumption
patricia
speech
on
this
occasion
was
of
an
unfettered
and
heady
nature
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
she
said
when
she
had
finally
paused
for
breath
and
had
wiped
away
her
tears
and
had
powdered
her
nose
viciously
to
bully
a
weak
and
defenseless
woman
in
this
way
i
dare
say
everybody
in
the
house
has
heard
us
brawling
and
squabbling
just
like
a
and
his
wife
what
that
you
have
said
a
word
for
fifteen
minutes
oh
la
la
la
well
i
do
care
anyhow
i
have
and
i
am
perfectly
sure
they
heard
me
and
i
am
sure
i
do
care
in
the
least
and
it
all
your
fault
anyway
oh
but
you
have
an
abominable
nature
rudolph
a
mean
and
cruel
and
suspicious
nature
your
little
charteris
is
nothing
whatever
to
me
and
i
would
have
been
quite
willing
to
give
him
up
if
you
had
spoken
to
me
in
a
decent
manner
about
it
you
only
i
do
care
what
you
said
and
besides
if
you
did
speak
to
me
in
a
decent
manner
it
simply
shows
that
your
thoughts
were
so
horrid
and
vulgar
that
even
you
were
so
abandoned
as
to
dare
to
put
them
into
words
very
well
then
i
wo
be
seen
so
much
with
him
in
future
i
realize
you
are
quite
capable
of
beating
me
if
i
do
give
way
to
your
absurd
prejudices
yes
you
are
rudolph
you
just
the
sort
of
man
to
take
pleasure
in
beating
a
woman
after
the
exhibition
of
temper
you
given
this
afternoon
i
believe
you
are
capable
of
anything
hand
me
that
parasol
do
keep
on
talking
to
me
for
i
do
wish
to
hear
anything
you
have
to
say
simply
driving
me
to
my
grave
with
your
continual
nagging
and
abuse
and
i
sure
i
wish
i
were
dead
as
much
as
you
do
is
my
hat
on
straight
how
do
you
expect
me
to
see
into
that
mirror
if
you
stand
directly
in
front
of
it
there
not
content
with
robbing
me
of
every
pleasure
in
life
i
verily
believe
you
were
going
to
let
me
go
downstairs
with
my
hat
cocked
over
one
ear
and
do
you
snort
and
look
at
me
like
that
i
not
going
to
meet
charteris
i
going
driving
with
felix
kennaston
he
asked
me
at
luncheon
i
suppose
you
object
to
him
next
you
object
to
all
my
friends
very
well
now
you
made
me
utterly
miserable
for
the
entire
afternoon
and
i
sure
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
there
was
a
rustle
of
skirts
and
the
door
slammed
iv
colonel
musgrave
went
to
his
own
room
where
he
spent
an
interval
in
meditation
he
opened
his
desk
and
took
out
a
small
packet
of
papers
some
of
which
he
read
listlessly
how
curiously
life
itself
he
reflected
for
here
again
were
castby
potent
to
breed
mischief
and
his
talk
with
polly
ashmeade
had
been
peculiarly
reminiscent
of
his
more
ancient
talk
with
clarice
pendomer
everything
that
happened
seemed
to
have
happened
before
but
presently
he
shook
his
head
sighing
chance
had
put
into
his
hands
a
weapon
and
a
formidable
weapon
it
seemed
to
him
but
the
colonel
did
not
care
to
use
it
he
preferred
to
strike
with
some
less
grimy
cudgel
then
he
rang
for
one
of
the
servants
questioned
him
and
was
informed
that
charteris
had
gone
down
to
the
beach
just
after
luncheon
a
moment
later
colonel
musgrave
was
walking
through
the
gardens
in
this
direction
as
he
came
to
the
thicket
which
screens
the
beach
he
called
charteris
name
loudly
in
order
to
ascertain
his
whereabouts
and
the
novelist
voice
answered
yet
not
at
once
but
after
a
brief
silence
it
chanced
that
at
this
moment
musgrave
had
come
to
a
thin
place
in
the
thicket
and
could
plainly
see
charteris
he
was
concealing
some
white
object
in
the
hollow
of
a
log
that
lay
by
the
river
a
little
later
musgrave
came
out
upon
the
beach
and
found
charteris
seated
upon
the
same
log
an
open
book
upon
his
knees
and
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
wonderingly
oh
said
john
charteris
so
it
was
you
rudolph
i
could
not
imagine
who
it
was
that
called
yes
i
wanted
a
word
with
you
jack
now
there
are
five
little
upon
the
beach
at
matocton
the
nearest
of
them
was
some
thirty
feet
from
charteris
it
might
have
been
either
imagination
or
the
prevalent
breeze
but
musgrave
certainly
thought
he
heard
a
door
closing
moreover
as
he
walked
around
the
end
of
the
log
he
glanced
downward
as
in
a
casual
manner
and
perceived
a
protrusion
which
bore
an
undeniable
resemblance
to
the
handle
of
a
parasol
musgrave
whistled
though
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
was
not
surprised
and
then
he
sat
down
upon
the
log
and
for
a
moment
was
silent
a
beautiful
evening
said
charteris
musgrave
lighted
a
cigarette
jack
i
have
something
rather
difficult
to
say
to
you
yes
it
is
deuced
difficult
and
the
sooner
it
is
over
the
better
i
why
confound
it
all
man
i
want
you
to
stop
making
love
to
my
wife
charteris
eyebrows
rose
really
colonel
musgrave
he
began
coolly
now
you
are
about
to
make
a
scene
you
know
said
musgrave
raising
his
hand
in
protest
and
we
are
not
here
for
that
we
are
not
going
to
tear
any
passions
to
tatters
we
are
not
going
to
rant
we
are
simply
going
to
have
a
quiet
and
sensible
talk
we
do
happen
to
be
characters
in
a
romance
for
you
are
lancelot
you
know
and
i
am
not
up
to
the
part
of
arthur
by
a
great
deal
i
am
not
angry
i
am
not
jealous
nor
do
i
put
the
matter
on
any
high
moral
grounds
i
simply
say
it
wo
do
no
hang
it
it
wo
do
i
dare
not
question
you
are
an
authority
in
such
matters
said
john
charteris
sweetly
since
among
many
others
clarice
pendomer
is
near
enough
to
be
an
obtainable
witness
colonel
musgrave
grimaced
but
what
a
gesture
he
thought
jack
charteris
quite
certainly
meant
to
make
the
most
of
the
immunity
musgrave
had
purchased
for
him
none
the
less
musgrave
had
now
his
cue
patricia
must
be
listening
and
so
what
colonel
musgrave
said
was
put
it
that
a
burnt
child
dreads
the
fire
is
that
a
reason
he
should
not
warn
his
friends
against
it
at
least
said
charteris
at
length
you
are
commendably
frank
i
appreciate
that
rudolph
i
honestly
appreciate
the
fact
you
have
come
to
me
not
as
the
husband
of
that
fiction
in
which
delight
breathing
fire
and
speaking
balderdash
but
as
one
sensible
man
to
another
let
us
be
frank
then
let
us
play
with
the
cards
upon
the
table
you
have
charged
me
with
loving
your
wife
and
i
answer
you
frankly
i
do
she
does
me
the
honor
to
return
this
affection
what
then
rudolph
musgrave
blew
out
a
puff
of
smoke
i
do
especially
mind
he
said
slowly
according
to
tradition
of
course
i
ought
to
spring
at
your
throat
with
a
smothered
curse
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
irritated
no
in
common
reason
he
added
upon
consideration
i
am
only
rather
sorry
for
you
both
charteris
sprang
to
his
feet
and
walked
up
and
down
the
beach
ah
you
hide
your
feelings
well
he
cried
and
his
laughter
was
a
trifle
unconvincing
and
a
bit
angry
but
it
is
unavailing
with
me
i
know
i
know
the
sick
and
impotent
hatred
of
me
that
is
seething
in
your
heart
and
i
feel
for
you
the
pity
you
pretend
to
entertain
toward
me
yes
i
pity
you
but
what
would
you
have
frankly
while
in
many
ways
an
estimable
man
you
are
no
fit
mate
for
patricia
she
has
the
sensitive
artistic
temperament
poor
girl
and
only
we
who
are
cursed
with
it
can
tell
you
what
its
possession
implies
and
you
since
frankness
is
the
order
of
the
day
you
know
well
you
impress
me
as
being
a
trifle
inadequate
it
is
not
your
fault
perhaps
but
the
fact
remains
that
you
have
never
amounted
to
anything
personally
you
have
simply
traded
upon
the
accident
of
being
born
a
musgrave
of
matocton
in
consequence
you
were
enabled
to
marry
patricia
money
just
as
the
musgraves
of
matocton
always
marry
some
woman
who
is
able
to
support
them
ah
but
it
was
her
money
you
married
and
not
patricia
any
community
of
interest
between
you
was
impossible
and
is
radically
impossible
your
marriage
was
a
hideous
mistake
just
as
mine
was
for
you
are
starving
her
soul
rudolph
just
as
anne
has
starved
mine
and
now
at
last
when
patricia
and
i
have
seen
our
single
chance
of
happiness
we
can
not
no
we
can
not
and
we
will
not
defer
to
any
outworn
tradition
or
to
fear
of
grundy
prattle
charteris
swept
aside
the
dogmas
of
the
world
with
an
indignant
gesture
of
somewhat
conscious
nobility
and
he
turned
to
his
companion
in
an
attitude
of
defiance
musgrave
was
smiling
he
smoked
and
seemed
to
enjoy
his
cigarette
the
day
was
approaching
sunset
the
sun
a
glowing
ball
of
copper
hung
low
in
the
west
over
a
rampart
of
purple
clouds
whose
heights
were
smeared
with
red
a
slight
almost
imperceptible
mist
rose
from
the
river
and
where
the
horizon
should
have
been
a
dubious
cloudland
prevailed
far
to
the
west
were
quiverings
upon
the
stream
surface
but
nearer
the
river
dimpled
with
waves
and
at
their
feet
the
water
grew
transparent
and
splashed
over
the
sleek
brown
sand
and
sucked
back
leaving
a
curved
line
of
bubbles
which
one
by
one
winked
gaped
and
burst
there
was
a
drowsy
peacefulness
in
the
air
behind
them
among
the
beeches
were
many
stealthy
and
at
long
intervals
a
sleepy
peevish
twittering
went
about
the
nested
trees
in
colonel
musgrave
face
the
primal
peace
was
mirrored
may
i
ask
said
he
at
length
what
you
propose
doing
charteris
answered
promptly
i
of
course
propose
said
he
to
ask
patricia
to
share
the
remainder
of
my
life
a
euphemism
as
i
take
it
for
an
elopement
i
hardly
thought
you
intended
going
so
far
rudolph
cried
charteris
drawing
himself
to
his
full
height
and
he
was
not
to
blame
for
the
fact
that
it
was
but
i
am
i
hope
an
honorable
man
i
can
not
eat
your
salt
and
steal
your
honor
so
i
loot
openly
or
not
at
all
the
colonel
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
presuppose
you
have
counted
the
cost
and
estimated
the
necessary
breakage
true
love
the
novelist
declared
in
a
hushed
sweet
voice
is
above
such
considerations
i
think
said
musgrave
slowly
that
any
love
worthy
of
the
name
will
always
appraise
the
cost
to
the
woman
it
is
of
patricia
i
am
thinking
she
loves
me
charteris
murmured
he
glanced
up
and
laughed
upon
my
soul
you
know
i
can
not
help
thinking
the
situation
a
bit
farcical
you
and
i
talking
over
matters
in
this
fashion
but
i
honestly
believe
the
one
chance
of
happiness
for
any
of
us
hinges
on
patricia
and
me
chucking
the
whole
affair
and
bolting
no
it
wo
do
no
hang
it
jack
it
will
not
do
musgrave
glanced
toward
the
and
he
lifted
his
voice
i
am
not
considering
you
in
the
least
and
under
the
circumstances
you
could
hardly
expect
me
to
it
is
of
patricia
i
am
thinking
i
have
made
her
altogether
happy
our
marriage
was
a
mating
of
incongruities
and
possibly
you
are
justified
in
calling
it
a
mistake
yet
day
in
and
day
out
i
think
we
get
along
as
well
together
as
do
most
couples
and
it
is
wasting
time
to
cry
over
spilt
milk
instead
it
rests
with
us
the
two
men
who
love
her
to
decide
what
is
best
for
patricia
it
is
she
and
only
she
we
must
consider
ah
you
are
right
said
charteris
and
his
eyes
grew
tender
she
must
have
what
she
most
desires
and
all
must
be
sacrificed
to
that
he
turned
and
spoke
as
simply
as
a
child
of
course
you
know
i
shall
be
giving
up
a
great
deal
for
love
of
her
but
i
am
willing
musgrave
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
h
doubtless
he
assented
why
then
we
wo
consider
the
others
we
will
not
consider
your
wife
who
who
worships
you
we
wo
consider
the
boy
i
for
my
part
think
it
is
a
mother
duty
to
leave
an
unsullied
name
to
her
child
but
probably
my
ideas
are
bourgeois
we
wo
consider
relatives
who
perhaps
will
find
it
rather
unpleasant
in
short
we
must
consider
no
one
save
patricia
of
course
one
can
not
make
an
omelet
without
breaking
a
few
eggs
no
the
question
is
whether
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
make
the
omelet
i
say
no
and
i
quoth
charteris
smiling
gently
say
yes
for
patricia
musgrave
went
on
as
in
meditation
but
speaking
very
clearly
it
means
giving
up
everything
it
means
giving
up
her
friends
and
the
life
to
which
she
is
accustomed
it
means
being
ashamed
to
face
those
who
were
formerly
her
friends
we
the
world
our
world
of
lichfield
i
mean
are
lax
enough
as
to
the
divorce
question
heaven
knows
but
we
ca
pardon
immorality
when
coupled
with
poverty
and
you
would
be
poor
you
know
your
books
are
tremendously
clever
jack
but
as
i
happen
to
know
the
proceeds
from
them
would
not
support
two
people
in
luxury
and
patricia
has
nothing
that
is
a
sordid
detail
of
course
but
it
is
worth
considering
patricia
would
never
be
happy
in
a
back
charteris
was
frankly
surprised
patricia
has
nothing
bless
your
soul
of
course
not
her
father
left
the
greater
part
of
his
money
to
our
boy
you
know
most
of
it
is
still
held
in
trust
for
our
boy
who
is
named
after
him
not
a
penny
of
it
belongs
to
patricia
and
even
i
can
not
touch
anything
but
a
certain
amount
of
interest
charteris
looked
at
the
colonel
with
eyes
that
were
sad
and
hurt
and
wistful
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
your
reason
for
telling
me
this
he
said
candidly
i
know
i
have
always
been
thought
a
mercenary
man
since
my
marriage
at
that
time
i
fancied
myself
too
much
in
love
with
anne
to
permit
any
sordid
considerations
of
fortune
to
stand
in
the
way
of
our
union
poor
anne
she
little
knows
what
sacrifices
i
have
made
for
her
she
too
would
be
dreadfully
unhappy
if
i
permitted
her
to
realize
that
our
marriage
was
a
mistake
god
help
her
yes
groaned
musgrave
and
as
concerns
patricia
you
are
entirely
right
it
would
be
hideously
unfair
to
condemn
her
to
a
life
of
comparative
poverty
my
books
sell
better
than
you
think
rudolph
but
still
an
author
can
not
hope
to
attain
affluence
so
long
as
he
is
handicapped
by
any
reverence
for
the
english
language
yes
i
was
about
to
do
patricia
a
great
wrong
i
rejoice
that
you
have
pointed
out
my
selfishness
for
i
have
been
abominably
selfish
i
confess
it
i
think
so
assented
musgrave
calmly
but
then
my
opinion
is
naturally
rather
prejudiced
yes
i
can
understand
what
patricia
must
mean
to
you
charteris
sighed
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
in
a
graceful
fashion
and
i
also
love
her
far
too
dearly
to
imperil
her
happiness
i
think
that
heaven
never
made
a
woman
more
worthy
to
be
loved
and
i
had
hoped
ah
well
after
all
we
can
not
utterly
defy
society
its
prejudices
however
unfounded
must
be
respected
what
would
you
have
this
dunderheaded
giantess
of
a
grundy
condemns
me
to
be
miserable
and
i
am
powerless
the
utmost
i
can
do
is
to
refrain
from
whining
over
the
unavoidable
and
rudolph
you
have
my
word
of
honor
that
henceforth
i
shall
bear
in
mind
more
constantly
my
duty
toward
one
of
my
best
and
oldest
friends
i
have
not
dealt
with
you
quite
honestly
i
confess
it
and
i
ask
your
pardon
charteris
held
out
his
hand
to
seal
the
compact
word
of
honor
queried
colonel
musgrave
with
an
odd
quizzing
sort
of
fondness
for
the
little
novelist
as
the
colonel
took
the
proffered
hand
why
then
that
is
settled
and
i
am
glad
of
it
i
told
you
you
know
it
would
do
see
you
at
supper
i
suppose
and
rudolph
musgrave
glanced
at
the
turned
on
his
heel
and
presently
plunged
into
the
beech
plantation
whistling
cheerfully
the
effect
of
the
melody
was
somewhat
impaired
by
the
apparent
necessity
of
breaking
off
at
intervals
in
order
to
smile
the
comedy
had
been
admirably
enacted
he
considered
on
both
sides
and
he
did
not
object
to
jack
charteris
retiring
with
all
the
honors
of
war
v
the
colonel
had
not
gone
far
however
before
he
paused
thrust
both
hands
into
his
trousers
pockets
and
stared
down
at
the
ground
for
a
matter
of
five
minutes
musgrave
shook
his
head
after
all
said
he
i
ca
trust
them
patricia
is
too
erratic
and
too
used
to
having
her
own
way
jack
will
try
to
break
off
with
her
now
of
course
but
jack
where
women
are
concerned
is
as
weak
as
water
it
is
not
a
nice
thing
to
do
but
well
one
must
fight
fire
with
fire
thereupon
he
retraced
his
steps
when
he
had
come
to
the
thin
spot
in
the
thicket
rudolph
musgrave
left
the
path
and
entered
the
shrubbery
there
he
composedly
sat
down
in
the
shadow
of
a
small
cedar
the
sight
of
his
wife
upon
the
beach
in
converse
with
charteris
did
not
appear
to
surprise
colonel
musgrave
patricia
was
speaking
quickly
she
held
a
bedraggled
parasol
in
one
hand
her
husband
noted
with
a
faint
thrill
of
wonder
that
at
times
and
in
a
rather
unwholesome
elfish
way
patricia
was
actually
beautiful
her
big
eyes
glowed
they
flashed
with
changing
lights
as
deep
waters
glitter
in
the
sun
her
hair
seemed
luminous
and
her
cheeks
flushed
the
soft
white
stuff
that
gowned
her
had
the
look
of
foam
against
the
gray
sky
she
seemed
a
freakish
spirit
in
the
act
of
vanishing
for
sky
and
water
were
all
one
lambent
gray
by
this
in
the
west
was
a
thin
smear
of
orange
but
for
the
rest
the
world
was
of
a
uniform
and
gleaming
gray
she
and
charteris
stood
in
the
heart
of
a
great
pearl
ah
believe
me
she
was
saying
rudolph
is
an
ophthalmic
bat
but
god
keep
us
all
respectable
is
rudolph
notion
of
a
sensible
so
he
just
preferred
to
see
nothing
and
bleat
out
edifying
axioms
that
is
one
of
his
favorite
tricks
no
it
was
a
comedy
for
my
benefit
i
tell
you
he
will
allow
a
deal
for
the
artistic
temperament
no
doubt
but
he
does
suppose
you
fetch
along
a
parasol
when
you
go
to
watch
a
sunset
especially
a
parasol
he
gave
me
last
month
indeed
protested
charteris
he
saw
nothing
i
was
too
quick
for
him
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
saw
him
looking
at
it
accordingly
i
paid
no
attention
to
what
he
said
but
you
ah
jack
you
were
splendid
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
elope
at
once
now
though
charteris
gave
her
no
immediate
answer
i
am
not
quite
sure
patricia
that
your
husband
is
not
to
a
certain
extent
in
the
right
believe
me
he
did
not
know
you
were
about
he
approached
me
in
a
perfectly
sensible
manner
and
exhibited
commendable
he
has
played
a
difficult
part
to
admiration
i
could
not
have
done
it
better
myself
and
it
is
not
for
us
who
have
been
endowed
with
gifts
denied
to
rudolph
to
reproach
him
for
lacking
the
finer
perceptions
and
sensibilities
of
life
yet
i
must
admit
that
for
the
time
i
was
a
little
hurt
by
his
evident
belief
that
we
would
allow
our
feeling
for
each
other
which
is
rather
beyond
his
comprehension
is
it
dear
to
be
coerced
by
mercenary
considerations
oh
rudolph
is
just
a
anyway
she
was
not
particularly
interested
in
the
subject
he
ca
help
that
you
know
charteris
reminded
her
gently
then
he
asked
after
a
little
i
suppose
it
is
all
true
that
what
is
true
about
your
having
no
money
of
your
own
he
laughed
but
she
could
see
how
deeply
he
had
been
pained
by
musgrave
suspicions
i
ask
because
as
your
husband
has
discovered
i
am
utterly
sordid
my
lady
and
care
only
for
your
wealth
ah
how
can
you
expect
a
man
like
that
to
understand
you
why
jack
how
ridiculous
in
you
to
be
hurt
by
what
the
brute
thinks
you
as
solemn
as
an
owl
my
dear
yes
it
true
enough
my
father
was
not
very
well
pleased
with
us
and
that
horrid
will
ah
jack
jack
how
grotesque
how
characteristic
it
was
his
thinking
such
things
would
influence
you
you
of
all
men
who
scarcely
know
what
money
is
it
was
even
more
grotesque
i
should
have
been
pained
by
his
thinking
it
charteris
said
sadly
but
what
would
you
have
i
am
so
abominably
in
love
with
you
that
it
seemed
a
sort
of
desecration
when
the
man
lugged
your
name
into
a
discussion
of
it
really
did
and
then
besides
ah
my
lady
you
know
that
i
would
glory
in
the
thought
that
i
had
given
up
all
for
you
you
know
i
think
that
i
would
willingly
work
my
fingers
to
the
bone
just
that
i
might
possess
you
always
so
i
had
dreamed
of
love
in
a
cottage
an
idyl
of
blissful
poverty
where
cupid
contents
himself
with
crusts
and
kisses
and
mocks
at
the
proverbial
wolf
on
the
doorstep
and
i
give
you
my
word
that
until
i
had
not
suspected
how
blindly
selfish
i
have
been
for
poor
old
prosaic
rudolph
is
in
the
right
after
all
your
delicate
tender
beauty
must
not
be
dragged
down
to
face
the
unlovely
realities
and
petty
deprivations
and
squalid
makeshifts
of
such
an
existence
as
ours
would
be
true
i
would
glory
in
them
ah
luxury
and
riches
mean
little
to
me
my
dear
and
i
can
conceive
of
no
greater
happiness
than
to
starve
with
you
but
true
love
knows
how
to
sacrifice
itself
your
husband
was
right
it
would
not
be
fair
to
you
patricia
you
you
are
going
to
leave
me
yes
and
i
pray
that
i
may
be
strong
enough
to
relinquish
you
forever
because
your
welfare
is
more
dear
to
me
than
my
own
happiness
no
i
do
not
pretend
that
this
is
easy
to
do
but
when
my
misery
is
earned
by
serving
you
i
prize
my
misery
charteris
tried
to
smile
what
would
you
have
i
love
you
he
said
simply
ah
my
dear
she
cried
musgrave
heart
was
sick
within
him
as
he
heard
the
same
notes
in
her
voice
that
echoed
in
anne
voice
when
she
spoke
of
her
husband
this
was
a
new
patricia
her
speech
was
low
and
gentle
now
and
her
eyes
held
a
light
rudolph
musgrave
had
not
seen
there
for
a
long
while
ah
my
dear
you
are
the
noblest
man
i
have
ever
known
i
wish
we
women
could
be
like
men
but
oh
jack
jack
do
be
quixotic
i
ca
give
you
up
my
dear
that
would
never
be
for
my
good
think
how
unhappy
i
have
been
all
these
years
think
how
rudolph
is
starving
my
soul
i
want
to
be
free
jack
i
want
to
live
my
own
life
for
at
least
a
month
or
so
patricia
shivered
here
but
none
of
us
is
sure
of
living
for
a
month
you
shown
me
a
glimpse
of
what
life
might
be
do
let
me
sink
back
into
the
old
humdrum
existence
from
a
foolish
sense
of
honor
i
tell
you
i
should
go
mad
i
mean
to
have
my
fling
while
i
can
get
it
and
i
mean
to
have
it
with
you
jack
just
you
i
do
fear
poverty
you
could
write
some
more
wonderful
books
i
could
work
too
jack
dear
i
i
could
teach
music
or
take
in
washing
or
something
anyway
lots
of
women
support
themselves
you
know
oh
jack
we
would
be
so
happy
do
be
honorable
and
brave
and
disagreeable
jack
dear
for
a
moment
charteris
was
silent
the
nostrils
of
his
nose
widened
a
little
and
a
curious
look
came
into
his
face
he
discovered
something
in
the
sand
that
interested
him
after
all
he
demanded
slowly
is
it
necessary
to
go
away
to
be
happy
i
do
understand
her
hand
lifted
from
his
arm
then
quick
remorse
smote
her
and
it
fluttered
back
confidingly
charteris
rose
to
his
feet
it
is
doubtless
a
very
spectacular
and
very
stirring
performance
to
cast
your
cap
over
the
in
the
face
of
the
world
but
after
all
is
it
not
a
bit
foolish
patricia
lots
of
people
manage
these
things
more
quietly
oh
jack
patricia
face
turned
red
then
white
and
stiffened
in
a
sort
of
sick
terror
she
was
a
frightened
columbine
in
stone
i
thought
you
cared
for
me
really
not
that
way
patricia
rose
and
spoke
with
composure
i
think
i
go
back
to
the
house
charteris
it
a
bit
chilly
here
you
need
bother
to
come
then
charteris
laughed
a
choking
sobbing
laugh
he
raised
his
hands
impotently
toward
heaven
and
to
think
he
cried
to
think
that
a
man
may
love
a
woman
with
his
whole
heart
with
all
that
is
best
and
noblest
in
him
and
she
understand
him
so
little
i
do
not
think
i
have
misunderstood
you
patricia
said
in
a
crisp
voice
your
proposition
was
very
explicit
i
am
sorry
i
thought
i
had
found
one
thing
in
the
world
which
i
would
regret
to
leave
and
you
really
believed
that
i
could
sully
the
great
love
i
bear
you
by
stooping
to
that
you
really
believed
that
i
would
sacrifice
to
you
my
home
life
my
honor
my
prospects
all
that
a
man
can
give
without
testing
the
quality
of
your
love
you
did
not
know
that
i
spoke
to
try
you
you
actually
did
not
know
eh
but
yours
is
a
light
nature
patricia
i
do
not
reproach
you
for
you
are
only
as
your
narrow
philistine
life
has
made
you
yet
i
had
hoped
better
things
of
you
patricia
but
you
who
pretend
to
care
for
me
have
leaped
at
your
first
opportunity
to
pain
me
and
if
it
be
any
comfort
to
you
i
confess
you
have
pained
me
beyond
words
and
he
sank
down
on
the
log
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
she
came
to
him
it
was
pitiable
to
see
how
she
came
to
him
laughing
and
sobbing
all
in
one
breath
and
knelt
humbly
by
his
side
and
raised
a
grieved
shamed
penitent
face
to
his
forgive
me
she
wailed
oh
forgive
me
you
have
pained
me
beyond
words
patricia
he
repeated
he
was
not
angry
only
sorrowful
and
very
much
hurt
ah
jack
dear
jack
forgive
me
charteris
sighed
but
of
course
i
forgive
you
patricia
he
said
i
can
not
help
it
though
that
i
am
foolishly
sensitive
where
you
are
concerned
and
i
had
hoped
you
knew
as
much
she
was
happy
now
dear
boy
she
murmured
do
you
see
it
just
these
constant
proofs
of
the
greatness
and
the
wonderfulness
of
your
love
really
though
jack
was
it
too
horrid
of
me
to
misunderstand
you
so
are
you
quite
sure
you
forgiven
me
entirely
without
any
nasty
little
reservations
charteris
was
quite
sure
his
face
was
still
sad
but
it
was
benevolent
do
you
see
she
went
on
that
it
just
these
things
that
make
me
care
for
you
so
much
and
feel
sure
as
eggs
is
eggs
we
will
be
happy
ah
jack
we
will
be
so
utterly
happy
that
i
am
almost
afraid
to
think
of
it
patricia
wiped
away
the
last
tear
and
laughed
and
added
in
a
fashion
there
a
train
at
in
the
morning
we
can
leave
by
that
before
anyone
is
up
charteris
started
your
husband
loves
you
he
said
in
gentle
reproof
and
quite
candidly
you
know
rudolph
is
worth
ten
of
me
bah
i
tell
you
that
was
a
comedy
for
my
benefit
she
protested
and
began
to
laugh
patricia
was
unutterably
happy
now
because
she
and
not
john
charteris
had
been
in
the
wrong
poor
rudolph
he
has
such
a
smug
horror
of
the
that
he
would
even
go
so
far
as
to
pretend
to
be
in
love
with
his
own
wife
in
order
to
keep
out
of
it
really
jack
both
our
are
horribly
commonplace
and
they
will
be
much
better
off
without
us
you
forget
that
rudolph
has
my
word
of
honor
said
charteris
in
indignation
and
that
instant
with
one
of
his
baffling
changes
of
mood
he
began
to
laugh
really
though
patricia
you
are
very
pretty
you
are
april
embodied
in
sweet
flesh
your
soul
is
just
a
wisp
of
april
cloud
and
your
life
an
april
day
half
sun
that
only
seems
to
warm
and
half
tempest
that
only
plays
at
ferocity
but
you
are
very
pretty
that
is
why
i
am
thinking
it
would
be
a
fine
and
past
doubt
an
agreeable
exploit
to
give
up
everything
for
such
a
woman
and
am
complacently
comparing
myself
to
antony
at
actium
i
am
thinking
it
would
be
an
interesting
episode
in
one
and
you
see
my
dear
i
honestly
believe
the
world
revolves
around
john
charteris
although
of
course
i
would
never
admit
that
to
you
if
i
thought
for
a
moment
you
would
take
me
seriously
then
presently
sighing
he
was
grave
again
but
no
rudolph
has
my
word
of
honor
charteris
repeated
and
with
unconcealed
regret
ah
does
that
matter
she
cried
does
anything
matter
except
that
we
love
each
other
i
tell
you
i
have
given
the
best
part
of
my
life
to
that
man
but
i
mean
to
make
the
most
of
what
is
left
he
has
had
my
youth
my
love
there
was
a
time
you
know
when
i
actually
fancied
i
cared
for
him
and
he
has
only
made
me
unhappy
i
hate
him
i
loathe
him
i
detest
him
i
despise
him
i
never
intend
to
speak
to
him
again
oh
yes
i
shall
have
to
at
supper
i
suppose
but
that
count
and
i
tell
you
i
mean
to
be
happy
in
the
only
way
possible
everyone
has
a
right
to
do
that
a
woman
has
an
especial
right
to
take
her
share
of
happiness
in
any
way
she
can
because
her
hour
of
it
is
so
short
sometimes
sometimes
the
woman
knows
how
short
it
is
and
it
almost
frightens
her
but
at
best
a
woman
can
be
really
happy
through
love
alone
jack
dear
and
it
only
when
we
are
young
and
good
to
look
at
that
men
care
for
us
after
that
there
is
nothing
left
but
to
take
to
either
religion
or
so
what
does
it
matter
after
all
yes
they
all
grow
tired
after
a
while
jack
i
am
only
a
vain
and
frivolous
person
of
superlative
charm
but
i
love
you
very
much
my
dear
and
i
solemnly
swear
to
commit
suicide
the
moment
my
first
wrinkle
arrives
you
shall
never
grow
tired
of
me
my
dear
she
laughed
to
think
how
true
this
was
she
hurried
on
jack
kneel
down
at
once
and
swear
that
you
are
perfectly
sore
with
loving
me
as
that
ridiculous
person
says
in
dickens
and
whose
name
i
never
could
remember
oh
i
forgot
dickens
caricatures
nature
does
he
and
is
read
by
really
cultured
people
you
will
have
to
educate
me
up
to
your
level
jack
and
i
warn
you
in
advance
you
will
not
have
time
to
do
it
yes
i
am
quite
aware
that
i
am
talking
nonsense
and
am
on
the
verge
of
hysterics
thank
you
but
i
rather
like
it
it
is
because
i
am
going
to
have
you
all
to
myself
for
whatever
future
there
is
and
the
thought
makes
me
quite
drunk
will
you
kindly
ring
for
the
jack
jack
are
you
quite
sure
you
love
me
are
you
perfectly
certain
you
never
loved
any
one
else
half
so
much
no
do
answer
me
for
i
intend
to
do
all
the
talking
for
both
of
us
for
the
future
i
shall
tyrannize
over
you
frightfully
and
you
will
like
it
all
i
ask
in
return
is
that
you
will
be
a
good
boy
by
which
i
mean
a
naughty
boy
and
do
solemnly
swear
promise
and
affirm
that
you
will
meet
me
at
the
at
five
in
the
morning
with
a
portmanteau
and
the
intention
of
never
going
back
to
your
wife
you
swear
it
thank
you
so
much
now
i
think
i
would
like
to
cry
for
a
few
minutes
and
after
that
we
will
go
back
to
the
house
before
supper
is
over
and
my
eyes
are
perfectly
crimson
in
fact
charteris
had
consented
patricia
was
irresistible
as
she
pleaded
and
mocked
and
scolded
and
coaxed
and
laughed
and
cried
all
in
one
bewildering
breath
her
plan
was
simple
it
was
to
slip
out
of
matocton
at
dawn
and
walk
to
the
station
there
they
would
take
the
train
and
snap
their
fingers
at
convention
the
scheme
sounded
preposterous
in
outline
but
she
demonstrated
its
practicability
in
performance
and
charteris
consented
rudolph
musgrave
sat
in
the
shadow
of
the
cedar
with
fierce
and
confused
emotions
whirling
in
his
soul
he
certainly
had
never
thought
of
this
contingency
part
eight
harvest
time
was
i
coveted
the
woes
they
rued
whose
love
commemorates
them
i
that
meant
to
get
like
grace
of
love
then
and
intent
to
win
as
they
had
done
love
plenitude
rapture
and
havoc
vauntingly
i
sued
that
love
like
theirs
might
make
a
toy
of
me
at
will
caressed
at
will
if
publicly
demolished
as
love
found
or
found
not
good
i
am
no
longer
overbrave
i
have
a
fever
i
that
always
knew
this
hour
was
certain
and
am
too
weak
to
rave
too
tired
to
seek
as
later
i
must
do
tried
remedies
time
manhood
and
the
grave
to
drug
abate
and
banish
love
of
you
allen
rossiter
i
when
patricia
and
charteris
had
left
the
beach
colonel
musgrave
parted
the
underbrush
and
stepped
down
upon
the
sand
he
must
have
air
air
and
an
open
place
wherein
to
fight
this
out
night
had
risen
about
him
in
bland
emptiness
there
were
no
stars
overhead
but
a
patient
wearied
ancient
moon
pushed
through
the
clouds
the
trees
and
the
river
conferred
with
one
another
doubtfully
he
paced
up
and
down
the
beach
musgrave
laughed
in
the
darkness
his
heart
was
racing
racing
in
him
and
his
thoughts
were
blown
foam
he
raised
his
hat
and
bowed
fantastically
in
the
darkness
because
the
colonel
loved
his
gesture
signor
lucifer
i
present
my
compliments
you
have
discoursed
with
me
very
plausibly
i
honor
your
cunning
signor
but
if
you
are
indeed
a
gentleman
as
i
have
always
heard
you
will
now
withdraw
and
permit
me
to
regard
the
matter
from
a
standpoint
other
than
my
own
for
the
others
are
weak
signor
as
you
have
doubtless
discovered
good
women
and
bad
men
are
the
weakest
of
their
sex
i
am
the
strongest
among
them
for
all
that
i
am
no
hercules
and
the
outcome
of
this
matter
must
rest
with
me
so
he
sat
presently
upon
the
log
where
charteris
had
sat
when
musgrave
came
to
this
beach
at
sunset
very
long
ago
that
seemed
now
for
now
the
colonel
was
tired
physically
outworn
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
after
prolonged
exertion
and
now
the
moon
looked
down
upon
him
passionless
cold
inexorable
and
seemed
to
await
the
colonel
decision
and
it
was
woefully
hard
to
come
to
any
decision
for
as
you
know
by
this
it
was
the
colonel
besetting
infirmity
to
shrink
from
making
changes
instinctively
he
balked
under
shelter
of
whatever
grandiloquent
excuse
against
commission
of
any
action
which
would
alter
his
relations
with
accustomed
circumstances
or
persons
to
guide
events
was
never
his
forte
as
he
forlornly
knew
and
here
he
was
condemned
perforce
to
play
that
uncongenial
rôle
with
slender
chances
of
reward
yet
always
anne
face
floated
in
the
darkness
always
anne
voice
whispered
through
the
lisping
of
the
beeches
through
the
murmur
of
the
water
he
sat
thus
for
a
long
while
ii
musgrave
was
not
unnaturally
late
for
supper
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
at
this
meal
the
colonel
faltered
in
his
duties
as
a
host
for
to
the
contrary
he
narrated
several
anecdotes
in
his
neatest
style
it
was
with
him
a
point
of
honor
always
to
be
in
company
the
social
triumph
of
his
generation
he
observed
with
idle
interest
that
charteris
and
patricia
avoided
each
other
in
a
rather
marked
manner
both
seemed
a
trifle
more
serious
than
they
were
wont
to
be
after
supper
tom
gelwix
brought
forth
a
mandolin
and
most
of
the
sang
songs
sentimental
and
otherwise
upon
the
front
porch
of
matocton
anne
had
disappeared
somewhere
musgrave
subsequently
discovered
her
in
one
of
the
puzzling
over
a
number
of
papers
which
her
maid
had
evidently
just
brought
to
her
charteris
looked
up
with
a
puckered
brow
rudolph
said
she
have
you
an
account
at
the
occidental
bank
hardly
an
account
dear
lady
merely
a
deposit
large
enough
to
entitle
me
to
receive
monthly
notices
that
i
have
overdrawn
it
why
then
of
course
you
have
a
horrible
things
they
such
a
nuisance
remembering
to
fill
out
those
little
stubs
of
course
i
forgot
to
bring
mine
with
me
i
always
do
and
equally
of
course
a
vexatious
debt
turns
up
and
finds
me
without
an
occidental
bank
cheque
to
my
name
musgrave
was
amused
that
said
he
is
easily
remedied
i
will
get
you
one
though
even
if
ah
well
what
is
the
good
of
trying
to
teach
you
adorable
women
anything
about
business
you
shall
have
your
indispensable
blank
form
in
three
minutes
he
returned
in
rather
less
than
that
time
with
the
cheque
anne
was
alone
now
she
was
gowned
in
some
dull
soft
yellow
stuff
and
sat
by
a
small
table
twiddling
a
you
must
sneer
at
my
business
methods
rudolph
she
said
pouting
a
little
as
she
filled
out
the
cheque
it
is
polite
sir
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
i
am
really
very
methodical
of
course
i
am
always
losing
my
and
drawing
cheques
and
forgetting
to
enter
them
and
i
usually
put
down
the
same
deposit
two
or
three
times
all
women
do
that
but
otherwise
i
am
really
very
careful
i
manage
all
the
accounts
i
ca
expect
jack
to
do
that
you
know
charteris
signed
her
name
with
a
flourish
and
nodded
at
the
colonel
wisely
dear
infant
but
he
is
quite
too
horribly
unpractical
do
you
know
this
bill
has
been
due
oh
for
months
and
he
forgot
it
entirely
until
this
evening
fortunately
he
can
settle
it
those
disagreeable
publishers
of
his
have
telegraphed
for
him
to
come
to
new
york
at
once
you
know
otherwise
dear
dear
but
marrying
a
genius
is
absolutely
ruinous
to
one
credit
is
it
rudolph
the
tradespeople
will
refuse
to
trust
us
soon
involuntarily
musgrave
had
seen
the
cheque
it
was
for
a
considerable
amount
and
it
was
made
out
to
john
charteris
beyond
doubt
said
musgrave
in
his
soul
jack
is
colossal
he
is
actually
drawing
on
his
wife
for
the
necessary
expenses
for
running
away
with
another
woman
the
colonel
sat
down
abruptly
before
the
great
open
fireplace
and
stared
hard
at
the
which
were
heaped
up
in
it
a
penny
said
she
at
length
he
glanced
up
with
a
smile
my
dear
madam
it
would
be
robbery
for
a
penny
you
may
read
of
the
subject
of
my
thoughts
in
any
of
the
yellow
journals
only
far
more
vividly
set
forth
and
obtain
a
variety
of
more
or
less
savory
additions
to
boot
i
was
thinking
of
the
lethbury
case
and
wondering
how
we
could
have
been
so
long
deceived
by
the
man
ah
poor
mrs
lethbury
anne
sighed
i
am
very
sorry
for
her
rudolph
she
was
a
good
woman
and
was
always
interested
in
charitable
work
do
you
know
said
colonel
musgrave
with
deliberation
it
is
she
i
can
not
understand
to
discover
that
he
had
been
systematically
hoodwinking
her
for
some
ten
years
that
after
making
away
with
as
much
of
her
fortune
as
he
was
able
to
lay
hands
on
he
has
betrayed
business
trust
after
business
trust
in
order
to
to
maintain
another
establishment
that
he
has
never
cared
for
her
and
has
made
her
his
dupe
time
after
time
in
order
to
obtain
money
for
his
gambling
debts
and
other
even
less
reputable
obligations
she
must
realize
all
these
things
now
you
know
and
one
would
have
thought
no
woman
love
could
possibly
survive
such
a
test
yet
she
is
standing
by
him
through
thick
and
thin
yes
i
confess
amelia
lethbury
puzzles
me
i
do
understand
her
mental
attitude
musgrave
was
looking
at
anne
very
intently
as
he
ended
why
but
of
course
said
anne
she
realizes
that
it
was
all
the
fault
of
that
that
other
woman
and
besides
the
the
entanglement
has
been
going
on
only
a
little
over
eight
years
not
ten
rudolph
she
was
entirely
in
earnest
colonel
musgrave
could
see
it
plainly
i
admit
i
had
looked
on
it
in
that
light
said
he
at
length
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
upon
my
soul
anne
he
cried
i
believe
you
think
the
woman
is
only
doing
the
natural
thing
only
doing
the
thing
one
has
a
right
to
expect
of
her
in
sticking
to
that
blackguard
after
she
has
found
him
out
charteris
raised
her
eyebrows
she
was
really
surprised
naturally
she
must
stand
by
her
husband
when
he
is
in
trouble
why
if
his
own
wife
did
who
would
rudolph
it
is
just
now
that
he
needs
her
most
it
would
be
abominable
to
desert
him
now
anne
paused
and
thought
depend
upon
it
she
knows
a
better
side
of
his
nature
than
we
can
see
she
knows
him
possibly
to
have
been
misled
or
to
have
acted
thoughtlessly
because
otherwise
she
would
not
stand
by
him
so
firmly
having
reached
this
satisfactory
conclusion
anne
began
to
laugh
at
musgrave
lack
of
penetration
probably
so
you
see
rudolph
in
either
case
her
conduct
is
perfectly
natural
and
this
he
cried
this
is
how
women
reason
am
i
very
stupid
jack
says
i
am
a
bit
illogical
at
times
but
rudolph
you
must
expect
a
woman
to
judge
the
man
she
loves
if
you
call
on
her
to
do
that
she
does
reason
about
it
she
just
goes
on
loving
him
and
thinking
how
horrid
you
are
women
love
men
as
they
do
children
they
punish
them
sometimes
but
only
in
deference
to
public
opinion
a
woman
will
always
find
an
excuse
for
the
man
she
loves
if
he
deserts
her
she
is
miserable
until
she
succeeds
in
demonstrating
to
herself
it
was
entirely
her
own
fault
after
that
she
is
properly
repentant
but
far
less
unhappy
and
anyhow
she
goes
on
loving
him
just
the
same
the
colonel
pondered
over
this
women
are
different
he
said
i
do
know
i
think
that
if
all
women
could
be
thrown
with
good
men
they
would
all
be
good
women
want
to
be
good
but
there
comes
a
time
to
each
one
of
them
when
she
wants
to
make
a
certain
man
happy
and
wants
that
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
and
then
of
course
if
he
wants
very
much
for
her
to
be
bad
she
will
be
bad
a
bad
woman
is
always
to
be
explained
by
a
bad
man
anne
nodded
very
wisely
then
she
began
to
laugh
but
this
time
at
herself
i
am
talking
quite
like
a
book
she
said
really
i
had
no
idea
i
was
so
clever
but
i
have
thought
of
this
before
rudolph
and
been
sorry
for
those
poor
women
who
who
have
found
the
right
sort
of
man
to
care
for
yes
musgrave
face
was
alert
you
have
been
luckier
than
most
anne
he
said
lucky
she
cried
and
that
queer
little
thrill
of
happiness
woke
again
in
her
rich
voice
ah
you
do
know
how
lucky
i
have
been
rudolph
i
have
never
cared
for
any
one
except
well
yes
you
a
great
while
ago
and
jack
and
you
are
both
good
men
ah
rudolph
it
was
very
dear
and
sweet
and
foolish
the
way
we
loved
each
other
but
you
mind
very
very
much
do
you
if
i
think
jack
is
the
best
man
in
the
world
and
by
far
the
best
man
in
the
world
for
me
he
is
so
good
to
me
he
is
so
good
and
kind
and
considerate
to
me
and
even
after
all
these
years
of
matrimony
he
is
always
the
lover
a
woman
appreciates
that
rudolph
she
wants
her
husband
to
be
always
her
lover
just
as
jack
is
and
never
to
give
in
when
she
coaxes
because
she
only
coaxes
when
she
knows
she
is
in
the
wrong
and
never
never
to
let
her
see
him
shaving
himself
if
a
husband
observes
these
simple
rules
rudolph
his
wife
will
be
a
happy
woman
and
jack
does
in
consequence
every
day
i
live
i
grow
fonder
of
him
and
appreciate
him
more
and
more
he
grows
upon
me
just
as
a
taste
for
strong
drink
might
without
him
without
him
anne
voice
died
away
then
she
faced
musgrave
indignantly
oh
rudolph
she
cried
how
horrid
of
you
how
mean
of
you
to
come
here
and
suggest
the
possibility
of
jack
dying
or
running
away
from
me
or
doing
anything
dreadful
like
that
colonel
musgrave
was
smiling
i
said
he
equably
my
dear
madam
if
you
will
reconsider
no
she
conceded
after
deliberation
it
was
exactly
your
fault
i
got
started
on
the
subject
of
jack
and
imagined
all
sorts
of
horrible
and
impossible
things
but
there
is
a
sort
of
a
something
in
the
air
probably
a
storm
is
coming
down
the
river
so
i
feel
very
morbid
and
very
foolish
rudolph
but
then
i
am
in
love
you
see
is
it
funny
after
all
these
years
anne
asked
with
a
smile
and
so
you
are
not
to
be
angry
rudolph
my
dear
he
said
i
assure
you
the
emotion
you
raise
in
me
is
very
far
from
resembling
that
of
anger
musgrave
rose
and
laughed
i
fear
you
know
we
will
create
a
scandal
if
we
sit
here
any
longer
let
see
what
the
others
are
doing
iii
that
night
after
his
guests
had
retired
colonel
musgrave
smoked
a
cigarette
on
the
front
porch
of
matocton
the
moon
now
in
the
zenith
was
bright
and
chill
after
a
while
musgrave
raised
his
face
toward
it
and
laughed
is
it
is
it
funny
he
demanded
echoing
anne
query
ruefully
eh
well
perhaps
i
still
retained
some
lingering
hope
in
a
season
of
discomfort
most
of
us
look
vaguely
for
a
miracle
and
at
times
it
comes
but
more
often
not
life
is
always
a
pantomime
with
a
fairy
waiting
to
break
through
the
darkness
in
a
burst
of
glory
and
reunite
the
severed
lovers
and
transform
their
enemies
into
pantaloons
in
this
case
it
is
certain
that
the
fairy
will
not
come
i
am
condemned
to
be
my
own
god
in
the
machine
having
demonstrated
this
to
himself
musgrave
went
into
the
house
and
drugged
his
mind
correcting
proofsheets
for
the
historical
association
quarterly
and
brought
down
to
the
year
his
list
of
wills
recorded
in
brummell
county
iv
the
night
was
well
advanced
when
charteris
stepped
noiselessly
into
the
room
the
colonel
was
then
sedately
writing
amid
a
host
of
motionless
mute
watchers
for
at
matocton
most
of
the
portraits
hang
in
the
east
thus
above
the
great
marble
mantel
carved
with
thyrsi
and
supported
by
proud
caryatides
you
will
find
burly
sebastian
musgrave
the
speaker
an
man
even
on
canvas
paint
me
among
dukes
and
earls
with
my
hat
on
to
show
i
am
in
all
things
a
republican
and
the
finest
diamond
in
the
colony
shall
be
yours
he
had
directed
the
painter
and
this
was
done
then
there
is
frail
wilhelmina
musgrave
that
famed
beauty
whose
story
all
lichfield
knows
and
no
genealogist
has
ever
cared
to
detail
eternally
weaving
flowers
about
her
shepherd
hat
there
too
is
evelyn
ramsay
before
whose
roguish
loveliness
as
you
may
remember
the
colonel
had
snapped
his
fingers
in
those
roseate
days
when
he
so
joyously
considered
his
profound
unworthiness
to
be
patricia
husband
there
is
also
the
colonial
governor
of
albemarle
a
van
dyck
this
two
knellers
and
lely
portrait
of
thomas
musgrave
the
poet
with
serious
blue
eyes
and
flaxen
hair
the
painting
of
captain
george
musgrave
who
distinguished
himself
at
the
siege
of
cartagena
is
admittedly
an
inferior
piece
of
work
but
it
has
vigor
none
the
less
and
below
it
hangs
the
sword
which
was
presented
to
him
by
the
lord
high
admiral
so
quietly
did
charteris
come
that
the
colonel
was
not
aware
of
his
entrance
until
the
novelist
had
coughed
gently
he
was
in
a
and
looked
unusually
wizened
i
saw
your
light
he
said
i
do
seem
to
be
able
to
sleep
somehow
it
is
so
infernally
hot
and
still
i
suppose
there
is
going
to
be
a
thunderstorm
i
hate
thunderstorms
they
frighten
me
the
little
man
was
speaking
like
a
peevish
child
oh
well
it
will
at
least
clear
the
air
said
rudolph
musgrave
sit
down
and
have
a
smoke
wo
you
no
thanks
charteris
had
gone
to
the
bookshelves
and
was
gently
pushing
and
pulling
at
the
books
so
as
to
arrange
their
backs
in
a
mathematically
straight
line
i
thought
i
would
borrow
something
to
read
why
this
is
the
tennyson
you
had
at
college
is
it
yes
i
remember
it
perfectly
these
two
had
roomed
together
through
their
college
days
yes
it
is
the
old
tennyson
and
yonder
is
the
identical
swinburne
you
used
to
spout
from
too
lord
jack
it
seems
a
century
since
i
used
to
listen
by
the
hour
to
triumph
of
time
and
dolores
ah
but
you
did
really
care
for
them
not
even
then
charteris
reached
up
his
back
still
turned
and
moved
a
candlestick
the
fraction
of
an
inch
there
is
something
so
disgustingly
wholesome
about
you
rudolph
and
it
appears
to
be
ineradicable
i
ca
imagine
how
i
ever
came
to
be
fond
of
you
the
colonel
was
twirling
his
pen
his
eyes
intent
upon
it
and
yet
we
fond
of
each
other
were
we
jack
why
i
positively
adored
you
you
were
such
a
strong
and
healthy
animal
upon
my
word
i
do
believe
i
ever
missed
a
single
football
game
you
played
in
in
fact
i
almost
learned
to
understand
the
game
on
your
account
you
see
it
was
so
good
to
watch
you
raging
about
with
touzled
hair
like
the
only
original
bull
of
bashan
and
the
others
tumbling
like
ninepins
it
used
to
make
me
quite
inordinately
proud
the
colonel
smoked
but
lord
how
proud
was
when
you
got
medals
yes
i
remember
even
if
i
did
bully
you
sometimes
remember
how
i
used
to
twist
your
arm
to
make
you
write
my
latin
exercises
jack
i
liked
to
have
you
do
that
charteris
said
simply
it
hurt
a
great
deal
but
i
liked
it
he
had
come
up
behind
the
colonel
who
was
still
seated
yes
that
was
a
long
while
ago
said
charteris
it
is
rather
terrible
is
it
to
reflect
precisely
how
long
ago
it
was
why
i
shall
be
bald
in
a
year
or
two
from
now
but
you
have
kept
almost
all
your
beautiful
hair
rudolph
charteris
touched
the
colonel
head
stroking
his
hair
ever
so
lightly
once
or
twice
it
was
in
effect
a
caress
the
colonel
was
aware
of
the
odor
of
myrrh
which
always
accompanied
charteris
and
felt
that
the
little
man
was
trembling
is
there
anything
you
want
to
tell
me
jack
the
colonel
said
he
sat
quite
still
there
was
the
tiniest
pause
the
caressing
lifted
from
musgrave
head
but
presently
gave
it
one
more
brief
and
touch
why
only
i
believe
i
am
leaving
at
a
rather
ungodly
hour
and
wo
see
you
but
i
hope
to
return
within
the
week
i
hope
so
jack
and
after
all
it
is
too
late
to
be
reading
i
shall
go
back
to
bed
and
take
more
trional
and
then
i
dare
say
i
shall
sleep
so
rudolph
jack
oh
yes
i
meant
of
course
the
colonel
sighed
then
he
spoke
abruptly
no
just
a
moment
jack
i
did
ask
you
to
come
here
but
since
you
have
come
by
chance
i
am
going
to
follow
the
promptings
of
that
chance
and
strike
a
blow
for
righteousness
with
soiled
weapons
jack
do
you
remember
suggesting
that
my
father
correspondence
during
the
war
might
be
of
value
and
that
his
desk
ought
to
be
overhauled
why
yes
of
course
musgrave
was
telling
me
she
began
the
task
said
charteris
and
smiled
a
little
unluckily
yes
but
well
in
any
event
it
suggested
to
me
that
old
letters
are
dangerous
i
really
had
no
idea
what
that
desk
contained
my
father
had
preserved
great
stacks
of
letters
i
have
been
going
through
them
they
were
most
of
them
from
women
letters
which
should
never
have
been
written
in
the
first
place
and
which
he
certainly
had
no
right
to
keep
what
and
is
will
still
extant
i
fancy
it
made
interesting
reading
rudolph
there
were
some
letters
which
in
a
measure
concern
you
jack
the
colonel
handed
him
a
small
packet
of
letters
if
you
will
read
the
top
one
it
will
explain
i
will
just
go
on
with
my
writing
he
wrote
steadily
for
a
moment
or
two
then
charteris
laughed
musically
i
have
always
known
there
was
a
between
my
mother
and
will
but
i
never
suspected
until
that
i
had
the
honor
to
be
your
rudolph
one
of
will
innumerable
bastards
charteris
was
pallid
and
though
he
seemed
perfectly
composed
his
eyes
glittered
as
with
gusty
brilliancies
i
understand
now
why
my
reputed
father
always
made
such
a
difference
between
my
sister
and
myself
i
never
liked
old
alvin
charteris
you
know
it
is
a
distinct
relief
to
be
informed
i
have
no
share
in
his
blood
although
of
course
the
knowledge
comes
a
trifle
suddenly
perhaps
i
should
have
kept
that
knowledge
to
myself
i
know
it
would
have
been
kinder
i
had
meant
to
be
kind
i
loathe
myself
for
dabbling
in
this
mess
but
in
view
of
all
things
it
seemed
necessary
to
let
you
know
i
am
your
own
brother
in
the
flesh
and
that
patricia
is
your
brother
wife
i
see
said
charteris
according
to
your
standards
that
would
make
a
great
difference
i
do
know
speaking
frankly
that
it
makes
much
difference
with
me
he
turned
again
to
the
bookshelves
so
that
musgrave
could
no
longer
see
his
face
charteris
ran
his
fingers
caressingly
over
the
backs
of
a
row
of
volumes
i
loved
my
mother
rudolph
i
never
loved
anyone
else
that
makes
a
difference
then
he
said
we
musgraves
how
patly
i
catalogue
myself
already
we
musgraves
have
a
deal
to
answer
for
rudolph
and
does
that
make
it
all
the
more
our
duty
to
live
clean
and
honest
lives
to
make
the
debt
no
greater
than
it
is
both
men
were
oddly
quiet
eh
i
am
not
so
sure
john
charteris
waved
airily
toward
sebastian
musgrave
counterfeit
then
toward
the
other
portraits
it
was
they
who
compounded
our
inheritances
rudolph
all
that
we
were
to
have
in
this
world
of
wit
and
strength
and
desire
and
endurance
we
know
their
histories
they
were
proud
brave
and
thriftless
a
greedy
and
lecherous
race
who
squeezed
life
dry
as
one
does
an
orange
and
left
us
the
dregs
i
think
that
it
is
droll
but
i
am
not
sure
it
places
us
under
any
obligation
in
fact
i
rather
think
god
owes
us
an
apology
rudolph
he
spoke
with
quaint
wistfulness
the
colonel
sat
regarding
him
in
silence
with
shocked
disapproving
eyes
then
charteris
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
and
grinned
like
a
hobgoblin
what
would
you
give
he
demanded
to
know
what
i
am
really
thinking
of
at
this
very
moment
while
i
talk
so
calmly
well
you
will
never
know
and
for
the
rest
you
are
at
liberty
to
use
your
documents
as
you
may
elect
i
am
john
charteris
whatever
man
begot
my
body
he
is
rotten
bones
and
it
is
as
such
i
value
him
i
was
never
anybody
son
or
friend
or
brother
or
lover
but
just
a
pen
that
someone
far
bigger
and
far
nobler
than
john
charteris
writes
with
occasionally
whereas
you
but
oh
you
are
funny
rudolph
and
then
dear
brother
charteris
added
sweetly
as
he
left
the
room
and
rudolph
musgrave
could
not
quite
believe
in
the
actuality
of
what
had
just
happened
in
common
with
most
of
us
he
got
his
general
notions
concerning
the
laws
of
life
from
reading
fiction
and
here
was
the
material
for
a
renaissance
tragedy
wasted
so
far
as
any
dénouement
went
destiny
once
more
was
hardly
rising
to
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
the
weapon
chance
had
forged
had
failed
rudolph
musgrave
utterly
and
indeed
he
wondered
now
how
he
could
ever
have
esteemed
it
formidable
jack
was
his
in
noveldom
or
in
a
melodrama
this
discovery
would
have
transformed
their
mutual
dealings
but
as
a
workaday
world
fact
musgrave
would
not
honestly
say
that
it
had
in
any
way
affected
his
feelings
toward
jack
and
it
appeared
to
have
left
charteris
equally
unaltered
i
am
not
sure
though
we
can
only
guess
where
jack
is
concerned
he
goes
his
own
way
always
tricky
and
furtive
and
lonelier
than
any
other
human
being
i
have
ever
known
it
is
loneliness
that
looks
out
of
his
eyes
really
even
when
he
is
mocking
and
sneering
the
colonel
meditated
then
he
sighed
and
went
back
to
the
tabulation
of
his
lists
of
wills
v
the
day
was
growing
strong
in
the
behind
matocton
as
yet
the
climbing
sun
fired
only
the
topmost
branches
and
flooded
them
with
a
tempered
radiance
through
which
birds
plunged
and
shrilled
vague
rumors
to
one
another
beneath
a
green
twilight
lingered
twilight
which
held
a
glow
chill
and
lucent
and
steady
as
that
of
an
emerald
vagrant
little
puffs
of
wind
bustled
among
the
leaves
with
a
thin
pretense
of
purpose
and
then
lapsed
and
merged
in
the
large
ambiguous
whispering
which
went
stealthily
about
the
grove
rudolph
musgrave
sat
on
a
stone
beside
the
road
that
winds
through
the
woods
toward
the
railway
station
and
smoked
nervously
he
was
disheartened
of
the
business
of
living
and
absurdly
enough
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
was
hungry
it
has
to
be
done
quietly
and
without
the
remotest
chance
of
ever
hearing
of
it
and
without
the
remotest
chance
of
its
ever
having
to
be
done
again
i
have
about
fifteen
minutes
in
which
to
convince
patricia
both
of
her
own
folly
and
of
the
fact
that
jack
is
an
unmitigated
cad
and
to
get
him
off
the
place
quietly
so
that
anne
will
suspect
nothing
and
i
never
knew
any
reasonable
argument
to
appeal
to
patricia
and
jack
will
be
a
cornered
rat
yes
it
is
a
large
contract
and
i
would
give
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
to
know
how
i
am
going
to
fulfil
it
at
this
moment
his
wife
and
charteris
carrying
two
portmanteaux
came
around
a
bend
in
the
road
not
twenty
feet
from
musgrave
they
were
both
rather
cross
in
the
clean
and
more
prosaic
light
of
morning
an
elopement
seemed
almost
silly
moreover
patricia
had
had
no
breakfast
and
charteris
had
been
much
annoyed
by
his
wife
who
had
breakfasted
with
him
and
had
insisted
on
driving
to
the
station
with
him
it
was
a
fact
but
perhaps
not
unworthy
of
notice
that
patricia
was
carrying
her
own
portmanteau
as
well
as
an
umbrella
the
three
faced
one
another
in
the
cool
twilight
the
woods
stirred
lazily
about
them
the
birds
were
singing
on
a
wager
now
ah
said
colonel
musgrave
so
you
have
come
at
last
i
have
been
expecting
you
for
some
time
patricia
dropped
her
portmanteau
sullenly
charteris
placed
his
with
care
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
said
oh
it
was
perhaps
the
only
observation
that
occurred
to
him
patricia
musgrave
began
very
kindly
and
very
gravely
you
are
about
to
do
a
foolish
thing
at
the
bottom
of
your
heart
even
now
you
know
you
are
about
to
do
a
foolish
thing
a
thing
you
will
regret
bitterly
and
unavailingly
for
the
rest
of
time
you
are
turning
your
back
on
the
world
our
world
on
the
one
possible
world
you
could
ever
be
happy
in
you
ca
be
happy
in
the
patricia
you
that
sort
but
you
can
never
come
back
to
us
then
patricia
it
matter
what
the
motive
was
what
the
temptation
was
or
how
great
the
repentance
is
you
can
not
ever
return
that
is
the
law
patricia
perhaps
it
is
always
a
just
law
we
did
make
it
you
and
i
but
it
is
the
law
and
we
must
obey
it
our
world
merely
says
that
leaving
it
once
you
can
not
ever
return
such
is
the
only
punishment
it
awards
you
for
it
knows
this
wise
old
world
of
ours
that
such
is
the
bitterest
punishment
which
could
ever
be
devised
for
you
our
world
has
made
you
what
you
are
in
every
thought
and
ideal
and
emotion
you
possess
you
are
a
product
of
our
world
you
could
live
in
the
patricia
you
are
a
product
of
our
world
that
can
never
take
root
in
that
alien
soil
come
back
to
us
before
it
is
too
late
patricia
musgrave
shook
himself
all
over
rather
like
a
newfoundland
dog
coming
out
of
the
water
and
the
grave
note
died
from
his
voice
he
smiled
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
and
now
said
he
i
will
stop
talking
like
a
problem
play
and
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
give
me
your
portmanteau
my
dear
and
upon
my
word
of
honor
you
will
never
hear
a
word
further
from
me
in
the
matter
jack
here
can
take
the
train
just
as
he
intended
and
and
you
and
i
will
go
back
to
the
house
and
have
a
good
hot
breakfast
together
eh
patricia
she
was
thinking
unreasonably
enough
how
big
and
strong
and
clean
her
husband
looked
in
the
growing
light
it
was
a
pity
jack
was
so
small
however
she
faced
musgrave
coldly
and
thought
how
ludicrously
wide
of
the
mark
were
all
these
threats
of
ostracism
she
shudderingly
wished
he
would
not
talk
of
soil
and
taking
root
and
hideous
things
like
that
but
otherwise
the
colonel
left
her
unmoved
he
was
certainly
though
charteris
was
lighting
a
cigarette
with
a
queer
contented
look
he
knew
the
value
of
patricia
stubbornness
now
still
he
appeared
to
be
using
an
unnecessary
number
of
matches
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
perceived
the
lack
of
dignity
as
well
as
the
utter
uselessness
in
making
such
a
scene
patricia
said
we
are
suited
for
each
other
rudolph
and
it
is
better
far
better
for
both
of
us
to
have
done
with
the
farce
of
pretending
to
be
i
am
sorry
that
you
still
care
for
me
i
did
know
that
but
for
the
future
i
intend
to
live
my
own
life
patricia
voice
faltered
and
she
stretched
out
her
hands
a
little
toward
her
husband
in
an
odd
gust
of
friendliness
he
looked
so
kind
and
he
was
not
smiling
in
that
way
she
never
liked
surely
that
so
unpardonable
a
crime
rudolph
she
asked
almost
humbly
no
my
dear
he
answered
it
is
not
unpardonable
it
is
impossible
you
ca
lead
your
own
life
patricia
none
of
us
can
each
life
is
bound
up
with
many
others
and
every
rash
act
of
yours
every
hasty
word
of
yours
must
affect
to
some
extent
the
lives
of
those
who
are
nearest
and
most
dear
to
you
but
oh
it
is
not
argument
that
i
would
be
at
patricia
there
was
a
woman
once
she
was
young
and
wealthy
and
ah
well
i
wo
deceive
you
by
exaggerating
her
personal
attractions
i
will
serve
up
to
you
no
praises
of
her
sauced
with
lies
but
fate
and
nature
had
combined
to
give
her
everything
a
woman
can
desire
and
all
this
that
woman
freely
gave
to
me
to
me
who
had
youth
or
wealth
or
fame
or
anything
and
i
ca
stand
by
for
that
dear
dead
girl
sake
and
watch
your
life
go
wrong
patricia
you
are
just
like
the
rest
of
them
olaf
and
when
had
she
used
that
nickname
last
he
wondered
you
imagine
you
are
in
love
with
a
girl
because
you
happen
to
like
the
color
of
her
eyes
or
because
there
is
a
curve
about
her
lips
that
appeals
to
you
that
is
love
olaf
as
we
women
understand
it
and
wildly
hideous
and
sad
it
seemed
to
colonel
musgrave
this
dreary
parody
of
their
old
only
he
dimly
knew
that
she
had
forgotten
john
charteris
existed
and
that
to
her
this
moment
seemed
no
less
sardonic
charteris
inhaled
lazily
yet
he
did
not
like
the
trembling
about
patricia
mouth
her
hands
too
opened
and
shut
tight
before
she
spoke
it
is
too
late
now
she
said
dully
i
gave
you
all
there
was
to
give
you
gave
me
just
what
grandma
pendomer
and
all
the
others
had
left
you
able
to
give
that
remnant
is
love
olaf
as
we
women
understand
it
and
anyhow
it
is
too
late
now
yet
patricia
was
remembering
a
time
when
rudolph
voice
held
always
that
grave
tender
note
in
speaking
to
her
it
seemed
a
great
while
ago
and
he
was
big
and
manly
just
like
his
voice
rudolph
was
and
he
looked
very
kind
desperately
patricia
began
to
count
over
the
times
her
husband
had
offended
her
had
he
talked
to
her
in
the
most
unwarrantable
manner
only
yesterday
afternoon
too
late
oh
not
a
bit
of
it
musgrave
cried
his
voice
sank
persuasively
why
patricia
you
are
only
thinking
the
matter
over
for
the
first
time
you
have
only
begun
to
think
of
it
why
there
is
the
boy
our
boy
patricia
surely
you
had
thought
of
roger
he
had
found
the
right
chord
at
last
it
quivered
and
thrilled
under
his
touch
and
the
sense
of
mastery
leaped
in
his
blood
of
a
sudden
he
knew
himself
dominant
her
face
was
red
then
white
and
her
eyes
wavered
before
the
blaze
of
his
that
held
her
compellingly
now
honestly
just
between
you
and
me
the
colonel
said
confidentially
was
there
ever
a
better
and
braver
and
quainter
and
handsomer
boy
in
the
world
why
patricia
surely
you
willingly
of
your
own
accord
go
away
from
him
and
never
see
him
again
oh
you
have
thought
i
tell
you
think
patricia
do
you
remember
that
first
day
when
i
came
into
your
room
at
the
hospital
and
he
ah
how
wrinkled
and
red
and
he
was
then
was
he
little
wife
do
you
remember
how
he
was
lying
on
your
breast
and
how
i
took
you
both
in
my
arms
and
held
you
close
for
a
moment
and
how
for
a
long
long
while
there
was
anything
left
of
the
whole
wide
world
except
just
us
three
and
god
smiling
down
upon
us
do
you
remember
patricia
do
you
remember
his
first
tooth
why
we
were
as
proud
of
him
you
and
i
as
if
there
had
never
been
a
tooth
before
in
all
the
history
of
the
world
do
you
remember
the
first
day
he
walked
why
he
staggered
a
great
distance
oh
nearly
two
yards
and
caught
hold
of
my
hand
and
laughed
and
turned
back
to
you
you
did
run
away
from
him
then
patricia
are
you
going
to
do
it
now
she
struggled
under
his
look
she
had
an
absurd
desire
to
cry
just
that
he
might
console
her
she
knew
he
would
why
was
it
so
hard
to
remember
that
she
hated
rudolph
of
course
she
hated
him
she
loved
that
other
man
yonder
his
name
was
jack
she
turned
toward
charteris
and
the
reassuring
smile
with
which
he
greeted
her
impressed
patricia
as
being
singularly
nasty
she
hated
both
of
them
she
wanted
in
that
brief
time
which
remained
for
having
anything
only
her
boy
her
soft
warm
little
roger
who
had
eyes
like
rudolph
i
i
it
too
late
rudolph
she
stammered
if
you
had
only
taken
better
care
of
me
rudolph
if
no
it
too
late
i
tell
you
you
will
be
kind
to
roger
i
am
only
weak
and
frivolous
and
heartlesss
i
am
not
fit
to
be
his
mother
i
not
fit
rudolph
rudolph
i
tell
you
i
not
fit
ah
let
me
go
my
dear
in
mercy
let
me
go
for
i
have
loved
the
boy
as
i
ought
to
and
i
am
afraid
to
look
you
in
the
face
and
you
wo
let
me
take
my
eyes
away
you
let
me
ah
rudolph
let
me
go
not
fit
his
voice
thrilled
with
strength
and
pulsed
with
tender
cadences
ah
patricia
i
am
not
fit
to
be
his
father
but
between
us
between
us
might
we
do
much
for
him
come
back
to
us
patricia
to
me
and
the
boy
we
need
you
my
dear
ah
i
am
only
a
stolid
unattractive
fogy
i
know
but
you
loved
me
once
and
i
am
the
father
of
your
child
my
standards
are
perhaps
and
in
any
event
they
are
not
your
standards
and
that
difference
has
broken
many
ties
between
us
but
i
am
the
father
of
your
child
you
must
you
come
back
to
me
and
the
boy
musgrave
caught
her
face
between
his
hands
and
lifted
it
toward
his
patricia
do
make
any
mistake
there
is
nothing
you
care
for
so
much
as
that
boy
you
ca
give
him
up
if
you
had
to
walk
over
ploughshares
to
come
to
him
you
would
do
it
if
you
could
win
him
a
moment
happiness
by
a
lifetime
of
poverty
and
misery
and
degradation
you
would
do
it
and
so
would
i
little
wife
that
is
the
tie
which
still
unites
us
that
is
the
tie
which
is
too
strong
ever
to
break
come
back
to
us
patricia
to
me
and
the
boy
i
jack
jack
take
me
away
she
wailed
helplessly
charteris
came
forward
with
a
smile
he
was
quite
sure
of
patricia
now
colonel
musgrave
he
said
with
a
faint
drawl
if
you
have
entirely
finished
your
edifying
and
i
assure
you
highly
entertaining
monologue
i
will
ask
you
to
excuse
us
i
oh
man
man
charteris
cried
not
unkindly
do
you
see
it
is
the
only
possible
outcome
musgrave
faced
him
the
glow
of
victory
was
pulsing
in
the
colonel
blood
but
his
eyes
were
chill
stars
now
jack
he
said
equably
i
am
going
to
talk
to
you
in
fact
i
am
going
to
discharge
an
agreeable
duty
toward
you
musgrave
drew
close
to
him
charteris
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
smile
however
was
not
entirely
satisfactory
it
did
not
suggest
enjoyment
i
do
blame
you
for
being
what
you
are
musgrave
went
on
curtly
you
were
born
so
doubtless
i
do
blame
a
snake
for
being
what
it
is
but
when
i
see
a
snake
i
claim
the
right
to
set
my
foot
on
its
head
when
i
see
a
man
like
you
well
this
is
the
right
i
claim
thereupon
rudolph
musgrave
struck
his
in
the
face
with
his
open
hand
the
colonel
was
a
strong
man
physically
and
on
this
occasion
he
made
no
effort
to
curb
his
strength
now
musgrave
concluded
you
are
going
away
from
this
place
very
quickly
and
you
are
going
alone
you
will
do
this
because
i
tell
you
to
do
so
and
because
you
are
afraid
of
me
understand
also
if
you
will
be
so
good
that
the
only
reason
i
do
give
you
a
thorough
thrashing
is
that
i
do
think
you
are
worth
the
trouble
i
only
want
patricia
to
perceive
exactly
what
sort
of
man
you
are
the
blow
staggered
charteris
he
seemed
to
grow
smaller
his
clothes
seemed
to
hang
more
loosely
about
him
his
face
was
and
the
red
mark
showed
plainly
upon
it
there
would
be
no
earthly
sense
in
my
hitting
you
back
he
said
equably
it
would
only
necessitate
my
getting
the
thrashing
which
i
can
assure
you
we
are
equally
anxious
to
avoid
of
course
you
are
able
to
knock
me
down
and
so
on
because
you
are
nearly
twice
as
big
as
i
am
i
fail
to
see
that
proves
anything
in
particular
come
patricia
and
he
turned
to
her
and
reached
out
his
hand
she
shrank
from
him
she
drew
away
from
him
without
any
vehemence
as
if
he
had
been
some
slimy
harmless
reptile
a
woman
does
not
like
to
see
fear
in
a
man
eyes
and
there
was
fear
in
charteris
eyes
for
all
that
he
smiled
patricia
heart
sickened
she
loathed
him
and
she
was
a
little
sorry
for
him
oh
you
cur
you
cur
she
gasped
in
a
wondering
whisper
patricia
went
to
her
husband
and
held
out
her
hands
she
was
afraid
of
him
she
was
proud
of
him
the
strong
animal
take
me
away
rudolph
she
said
simply
take
me
away
from
that
that
coward
take
me
away
my
dear
you
may
beat
me
too
if
you
like
rudolph
i
dare
say
i
have
deserved
it
but
i
want
you
to
deal
brutally
with
me
to
carry
me
away
by
force
just
as
you
threatened
to
do
the
day
we
were
married
at
the
library
you
remember
when
the
man
was
crying
oranges
and
you
smelt
so
deliciously
of
soap
and
leather
and
cigarette
smoke
musgrave
took
both
her
hands
in
his
he
smiled
at
charteris
the
novelist
returned
the
smile
intensifying
its
sweetness
i
fancy
rudolph
he
said
that
after
all
i
shall
have
to
take
that
train
alone
charteris
continued
with
a
grimace
you
have
no
notion
though
how
annoying
it
is
not
to
possess
an
iota
of
what
is
vulgarly
considered
manliness
but
what
am
i
to
do
i
was
not
born
with
the
knack
of
enduring
physical
pain
oh
yes
i
am
a
coward
if
you
like
to
put
it
nakedly
but
i
was
born
so
personally
if
i
had
been
consulted
in
the
matter
i
would
have
preferred
the
usual
portion
of
valor
however
the
sanctity
of
the
hearth
has
been
most
edifyingly
preserved
and
after
all
the
woman
is
not
worth
squabbling
about
there
was
exceedingly
little
of
the
mountebank
in
him
now
he
kicked
patricia
portmanteau
frankly
and
viciously
as
he
stepped
over
it
to
lift
his
own
holding
this
in
one
hand
john
charteris
spoke
honestly
rudolph
i
had
a
trifle
underrated
your
resources
for
you
are
a
brave
man
we
physical
cowards
you
know
admire
that
above
all
things
and
a
strong
man
and
a
clever
man
in
that
you
have
adroitly
played
upon
the
purely
brutal
traits
of
women
any
clings
to
its
young
and
looks
for
protection
in
its
mate
upon
a
higher
ground
i
would
have
beaten
you
but
as
an
animal
you
are
my
superior
still
a
thing
done
has
an
end
you
have
won
back
your
wife
in
open
fight
i
fancy
by
the
way
that
you
have
rather
laid
up
future
trouble
for
yourself
in
doing
so
but
i
honor
the
skill
you
have
shown
colonel
musgrave
it
is
to
you
that
as
the
vulgar
phrase
it
i
take
off
my
hat
thereupon
charteris
uncovered
his
head
with
perfect
gravity
and
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
down
the
road
whistling
melodiously
musgrave
stared
after
him
for
a
while
the
lust
of
victory
died
the
tumult
and
passion
and
fervor
were
gone
from
musgrave
soul
he
could
very
easily
imagine
the
things
jack
charteris
would
say
to
anne
concerning
him
and
the
colonel
knew
that
she
would
believe
them
all
he
had
won
the
game
he
had
played
it
heartily
and
skilfully
and
successfully
and
his
reward
was
that
the
old
bickerings
with
patricia
should
continue
and
that
anne
should
be
taught
to
loathe
him
he
foresaw
it
all
very
plainly
as
he
stood
hand
in
hand
with
his
wife
but
anne
would
be
happy
it
was
for
that
he
had
played
vi
they
came
back
to
matocton
almost
silently
the
spell
of
the
dawn
was
broken
it
was
honest
garish
day
now
and
they
were
both
hungry
patricia
spirits
were
rising
as
a
butterfly
might
after
a
thunderstorm
since
she
had
only
a
few
months
to
live
she
would
at
least
not
waste
them
in
squabbling
she
would
be
conscientiously
agreeable
to
everybody
ah
rudolph
rudolph
she
cooed
if
i
had
only
known
all
along
that
you
loved
me
my
dear
he
protested
fondly
it
seemed
such
a
matter
of
course
he
was
a
little
tired
perhaps
the
portmanteau
seemed
very
heavy
a
woman
likes
to
be
told
a
woman
likes
to
be
told
every
day
otherwise
she
forgets
patricia
murmured
then
her
face
grew
tenderly
reproachful
ah
rudolph
rudolph
see
what
your
carelessness
and
neglect
has
nearly
led
to
it
nearly
led
to
my
running
away
with
a
man
like
like
that
it
would
have
been
all
your
fault
rudolph
if
i
had
you
know
it
would
have
been
rudolph
and
patricia
sighed
once
more
and
then
laughed
and
became
magnanimous
yes
yes
after
all
you
are
the
boy
father
she
smiled
up
at
him
kindly
and
indulgently
i
forgive
you
rudolph
said
patricia
he
must
have
shown
that
pardon
from
patricia
just
now
was
not
unflavored
with
irony
for
she
continued
in
another
voice
who
after
all
is
the
one
human
being
you
love
you
know
that
it
the
boy
and
just
the
boy
alone
i
gave
you
that
boy
you
should
remember
that
i
think
i
do
remember
it
patricia
i
bore
the
child
i
paid
the
price
not
you
patricia
said
very
quiet
no
i
do
mean
the
price
all
women
have
to
pay
she
paused
in
their
leisurely
progress
and
drew
vague
outlines
in
the
roadway
with
the
ferrule
of
her
umbrella
before
she
looked
up
into
rudolph
face
she
appraised
it
for
a
long
while
and
quite
as
if
her
husband
were
a
stranger
yes
i
could
make
you
very
sorry
for
me
if
i
wanted
to
her
thoughts
ran
thus
but
what
the
use
you
could
only
become
an
interminable
nuisance
in
trying
to
soothe
my
dying
hours
you
have
just
obstinately
squatted
around
in
lichfield
and
devoted
all
your
time
to
being
beautiful
and
good
and
mooning
around
women
for
i
do
know
how
many
years
you
make
me
tired
and
i
have
half
a
mind
to
tell
you
so
right
now
and
there
really
is
no
earthly
sense
in
attempting
to
explain
things
to
you
you
have
so
got
into
the
habit
of
being
beautiful
and
good
that
you
are
capable
of
quoting
scripture
after
i
have
finished
then
i
would
assuredly
box
your
jaws
because
i
do
yearn
to
be
a
poor
stricken
dear
and
weep
on
anybody
bosom
and
i
do
particularly
care
about
your
opinion
of
me
anyway
aloud
she
said
oh
well
let
go
and
get
some
breakfast
vii
and
thus
the
situation
stayed
patricia
told
him
nothing
and
rudolph
musgrave
knowing
that
according
to
his
lights
he
had
behaved
not
unhandsomely
was
the
merest
trifle
patronizing
and
rather
like
a
person
speaking
from
a
superior
plane
in
his
future
dealings
with
patricia
moreover
he
was
engrossed
at
this
time
by
his
scholarly
compilation
of
lichfield
legislative
papers
prior
to
which
was
printed
the
following
february
she
told
him
nothing
she
was
a
devoted
mother
for
two
days
space
and
then
candidly
decided
that
roger
was
developing
into
the
most
insufferable
of
little
prigs
and
besides
if
he
had
never
been
born
i
would
quite
probably
have
lived
to
keep
my
teeth
in
a
glass
of
water
at
night
and
i
ca
help
thinking
of
that
privilege
being
denied
me
whenever
i
look
at
him
she
told
rudolph
musgrave
nothing
she
was
finding
it
mildly
amusing
to
note
how
people
came
and
went
at
matocton
and
to
appraise
these
people
disinterestedly
because
she
would
never
see
them
again
patricia
was
drawing
her
own
conclusions
as
to
lichfield
aristocracy
these
people
for
the
most
part
a
preposterously
handsome
race
were
the
pleasantest
of
companions
and
their
manners
were
perfection
but
there
was
enough
of
old
roger
stapylton
blood
in
patricia
veins
to
make
her
feel
however
obscurely
that
nobody
is
justified
in
living
without
even
an
attempt
at
any
personal
achievement
the
younger
men
evinced
a
marked
tendency
to
leave
lichfield
to
make
their
homes
elsewhere
she
noted
and
they
very
often
attained
prominence
there
was
joe
parkinson
for
instance
who
had
lunched
at
oyster
bay
only
last
thursday
according
to
the
and
meanwhile
the
men
of
her
husband
generation
clung
to
their
old
mansions
and
were
ornamental
certainly
and
were
very
certainly
profoundly
for
they
adhered
to
the
customs
of
yesterday
under
the
comfortable
delusion
that
this
was
the
only
way
to
uphold
ideals
but
what
in
heaven
name
had
any
of
these
men
of
rudolph
musgrave
circle
ever
done
beyond
enough
perfunctory
say
to
furnish
him
food
and
clothes
a
hamlet
of
hamlets
was
patricia
verdict
as
to
lichfield
whose
actual
tragedy
is
that
their
fathers
were
badly
treated
but
that
they
themselves
are
constitutionally
unable
to
do
anything
except
talk
about
how
badly
their
fathers
were
treated
no
it
was
not
altogether
that
these
men
were
indolent
rudolph
and
rudolph
peers
had
been
reared
in
the
belief
that
when
any
manual
labor
became
inevitable
you
as
a
matter
of
course
entrusted
its
execution
to
a
negro
and
forced
themselves
to
labor
they
not
unnaturally
complied
with
an
sense
of
unfair
treatment
and
in
consequence
performed
the
work
inefficiently
lichfield
had
no
doubt
preserved
a
comely
manner
of
living
but
it
had
produced
in
the
last
nothing
of
real
importance
except
john
charteris
viii
for
charteris
was
important
patricia
was
rereading
all
the
books
that
charteris
had
published
and
they
engrossed
her
with
an
augmenting
admiration
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
dilate
upon
the
marvelous
and
winning
pictures
of
life
in
lichfield
before
the
war
between
the
states
which
charteris
has
painted
in
his
novels
even
as
the
king
of
birds
that
with
unwearied
wing
soars
nearest
to
the
sun
yet
wears
upon
his
breast
the
softest
down
as
we
learn
from
no
less
eminent
authority
than
that
of
the
so
charteris
is
equally
expert
in
depicting
the
and
tenderness
of
those
glorious
days
of
chivalry
of
fair
women
and
brave
men
of
gentle
breeding
of
splendid
culture
and
wholesome
living
patricia
was
not
a
little
puzzled
by
these
books
the
traditional
lichfield
she
decided
in
the
outcome
may
very
possibly
have
been
just
the
of
a
charlatan
cleverness
but
even
in
that
event
here
were
the
tales
of
life
in
lichfield
ardent
sumptuous
and
fragrant
throughout
with
the
fragrance
of
love
and
roses
of
rhyme
and
of
youth
lovely
fallacies
and
for
the
if
it
deserved
no
higher
name
all
who
believed
that
living
ought
to
be
a
uniformly
noble
transaction
could
not
fail
to
be
grateful
eternally
esthetic
values
apart
and
indeed
to
all
such
values
patricia
accorded
a
provisional
respect
what
most
impressed
her
stapyltonian
mind
was
the
fact
that
these
books
represented
in
a
perfectly
tangible
way
success
patricia
very
heartily
admired
success
when
it
was
brevetted
as
such
by
the
applause
of
others
and
while
to
be
a
noted
stylist
and
even
to
be
reasonably
sure
of
annotated
reissuement
for
the
plaguing
of
unborn
schoolchildren
was
all
well
enough
in
an
unimportant
way
patricia
was
far
more
vividly
impressed
by
the
blunt
figures
which
told
how
many
of
john
charteris
books
had
been
bought
and
paid
for
she
accepted
these
figures
as
his
publishers
gave
them
forth
implicitly
and
she
marveled
over
and
took
odd
joy
in
these
figures
they
enabled
her
to
admire
charteris
books
without
reservation
by
this
time
ashmeade
had
managed
in
the
most
natural
manner
to
tell
patricia
a
deal
concerning
charteris
no
halo
graced
the
portrait
ashmeade
painted
but
indeed
patricia
now
viewed
john
charteris
considered
as
a
person
without
any
particular
bias
she
did
not
especially
care
now
what
the
man
had
done
or
had
omitted
to
do
but
the
venerable
incongruity
of
the
writer
and
his
work
confronted
her
intriguingly
a
charteris
writes
old
lichfield
a
cockney
writes
eve
of
agnes
a
genteel
printer
evolves
a
lovelace
and
a
cutpurse
pens
the
of
dead
in
a
brothel
it
is
manifestly
impossible
and
it
happens
so
here
then
was
a
knave
who
held
somehow
the
keys
to
a
courtlier
and
nobler
world
these
tales
made
living
seem
a
braver
business
for
all
that
they
were
written
by
a
poltroon
was
it
pure
posturing
patricia
at
least
thought
it
was
not
at
worst
such
dexterous
maintenance
of
a
pose
was
hardly
despicable
she
considered
and
anyhow
she
preferred
to
believe
that
charteris
had
by
some
miracle
put
the
best
of
himself
into
these
books
had
somehow
clarified
the
abhorrent
mixture
of
ability
and
evil
which
was
john
charteris
and
the
best
in
him
she
found
on
this
hypothesis
to
be
a
deal
more
admirable
than
the
best
in
rudolph
musgrave
it
a
part
of
jack
she
fiercely
said
it
is
because
i
know
it
is
all
this
is
part
of
him
as
much
a
part
of
him
as
the
cowardice
and
the
trickery
so
i
do
really
care
if
he
is
a
liar
and
a
coward
i
ought
to
i
suppose
but
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
admire
him
he
has
made
something
he
has
created
these
beautiful
books
and
they
will
be
here
when
we
are
all
dead
he
does
leave
the
world
just
as
he
found
it
that
is
the
only
real
cowardice
i
think
especially
as
i
am
going
to
do
it
and
later
she
said
belligerently
if
i
had
been
a
man
i
could
have
at
least
assassinated
somebody
who
was
prominent
i
do
wish
rudolph
was
not
such
a
and
i
wish
i
liked
rudolph
better
but
on
the
whole
i
prefer
the
physical
coward
to
the
moral
one
rudolph
simply
bores
me
stiff
with
his
benevolent
airs
he
just
walks
around
the
place
forgiving
me
sixty
times
to
the
hour
and
if
he
does
stop
it
i
am
going
to
slap
him
thus
patricia
ix
the
world
knows
how
charteris
was
killed
in
fairhaven
by
jasper
hardress
the
husband
of
that
flighty
hardress
anne
had
spoken
of
and
i
hardly
know
said
ashmeade
whether
more
to
admire
the
justice
or
the
sardonic
humor
of
the
performance
here
after
hundreds
of
entanglements
with
women
john
charteris
manages
to
be
shot
by
a
jealous
maniac
on
account
of
a
woman
with
whom
for
a
wonder
his
relations
were
proven
to
be
innocent
the
man
needed
killing
but
it
is
asking
too
much
of
human
nature
to
put
up
with
his
being
made
a
martyr
of
she
cried
a
little
though
it
it
because
i
remember
him
when
he
was
turning
out
his
first
mustache
she
explained
lucidly
but
with
the
horror
and
irony
of
john
charteris
assassination
the
biographer
of
rudolph
musgrave
has
really
nothing
to
do
save
in
so
far
as
this
event
influenced
the
life
of
rudolph
musgrave
it
was
on
the
day
of
charteris
death
a
fine
clear
afternoon
in
late
september
that
rudolph
musgrave
went
with
some
eight
of
his
masculine
guests
luncheon
was
brought
to
them
in
a
boat
about
two
along
with
the
day
mail
i
say
but
listen
everybody
cried
alfred
chayter
whose
mail
included
a
morning
paper
the
in
fact
he
read
aloud
i
wish
i
could
be
with
anne
thought
colonel
musgrave
it
may
be
i
could
make
things
easier
but
anne
was
in
lichfield
now
he
had
just
finished
dressing
for
supper
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
since
their
return
from
the
river
he
had
not
seen
patricia
he
was
afraid
that
patricia
also
would
be
upset
by
this
deplorable
news
as
he
crossed
the
hall
virginia
came
out
of
patricia
rooms
the
colonel
raised
his
voice
in
speaking
to
her
for
with
age
virginia
was
growing
very
deaf
yaas
suh
she
said
i
doin
middlin
well
suh
thank
yeh
suh
jus
took
the
evenin
mail
to
miss
patricy
like
i
always
do
suh
she
went
away
quietly
her
pleasant
yellow
face
as
imperturbable
as
an
idol
he
went
into
patricia
bedroom
patricia
had
been
taking
an
afternoon
nap
and
had
not
risen
from
the
couch
where
she
lay
with
three
or
four
unopened
letters
upon
her
breast
two
she
had
opened
and
dropped
upon
the
floor
she
seemed
not
to
hear
him
when
he
spoke
her
name
and
yet
she
was
not
asleep
because
her
eyes
were
partly
unclosed
there
was
no
purple
glint
in
them
as
once
there
had
been
always
her
countenance
indeed
showed
everywhere
less
brightly
tinted
than
normally
it
should
be
her
heavy
hair
alone
undimmed
seemed
like
some
parasitic
growth
he
thought
to
sustain
its
beauty
by
virtue
of
having
drained
patricia
body
of
color
and
vitality
there
was
a
newspaper
in
her
right
hand
with
flamboyant
headlines
because
to
lichfield
the
death
of
john
charteris
was
an
event
of
importance
patricia
seemed
very
young
you
saw
that
she
had
suffered
you
knew
it
was
not
fair
to
hurt
a
child
like
that
but
indeed
rudolph
musgrave
hardly
realized
as
yet
that
patricia
was
dead
for
colonel
musgrave
was
thinking
of
that
time
when
this
same
patricia
had
first
come
to
him
from
the
heart
of
an
ancient
sunset
and
he
had
noted
for
the
first
time
that
her
hair
was
like
the
reflection
of
a
sunset
in
rippling
waters
and
that
her
mouth
was
an
inconsiderable
trifle
a
scrap
of
sanguine
curves
and
that
her
eyes
were
purple
glimpses
of
infinity
this
same
patricia
he
said
aloud
part
nine
relics
you
have
chosen
the
love
lives
sans
murmurings
sans
passion
and
incuriously
endures
the
gradual
lapse
of
time
you
have
chosen
as
yours
a
level
life
of
little
happenings
and
through
the
long
autumnal
evenings
lord
love
no
doubt
is
of
the
company
and
hugs
your
ingleside
contentedly
smiles
at
old
griefs
and
rustles
needless
wings
and
yet
i
think
that
sometimes
memories
of
divers
trysts
of
blood
that
urged
like
wine
on
moonlit
nights
and
of
that
first
long
kiss
whereby
your
lips
were
first
made
one
with
mine
awake
and
trouble
you
and
loving
is
once
more
important
and
perhaps
divine
allen
rossiter
in
i
to
those
who
knew
john
charteris
only
through
the
medium
of
the
printed
page
it
must
have
appeared
that
the
novelist
was
stayed
in
by
an
accident
of
unrelieved
and
singular
brutality
and
truly
thus
extinguished
by
the
unfounded
jealousy
of
a
madman
the
force
of
charteris
genius
seemed
and
seems
as
emphasized
by
that
sinister
caprice
of
chance
which
annihilated
it
but
people
in
lichfield
after
the
manner
of
each
prophet
countrymen
had
their
own
point
of
view
the
artist
always
stood
between
these
people
and
the
artist
handiwork
in
part
obscuring
it
in
any
event
it
was
generally
agreed
in
lichfield
that
anne
conduct
after
her
husband
death
was
not
all
which
could
be
desired
to
begin
with
she
attended
the
funeral
in
black
it
was
true
but
wearing
only
the
lightest
of
net
veils
pinned
under
her
chin
more
as
if
she
were
going
somewhere
on
the
train
you
know
than
as
if
she
were
in
genuine
bereavement
jack
did
approve
of
mourning
he
said
it
was
a
heathen
survival
that
was
the
only
explanation
she
offered
it
seemed
inadequate
to
lichfield
it
was
preferable
as
good
taste
went
for
a
widow
to
be
too
overcome
to
attend
her
husband
funeral
at
all
and
charteris
had
not
wept
once
during
the
church
ceremony
and
had
not
even
had
hysterics
during
the
interment
at
cedarwood
and
she
had
capped
a
scandalous
morning
work
by
remaining
with
the
undertaker
and
the
bricklayers
to
supervise
the
closing
of
john
charteris
grave
why
but
of
course
it
is
the
last
thing
i
will
ever
be
allowed
to
do
for
him
she
had
said
in
innocent
surprise
why
should
i
her
air
was
such
that
you
were
both
to
talk
to
her
about
appearances
because
she
is
a
bit
like
a
widow
as
ashmeade
pointed
out
anybody
can
condole
with
a
widow
and
devote
two
outer
sheets
to
explaining
that
you
realize
nothing
you
can
say
will
be
of
any
comfort
to
her
and
begin
at
the
top
of
the
inside
page
by
telling
her
how
much
better
off
he
is
which
i
have
always
thought
a
assertion
when
advanced
to
a
man
widow
but
you
can
not
condole
with
a
lantern
whose
light
has
been
blown
out
that
is
what
anne
is
ashmeade
meditated
and
appeared
dissatisfied
and
john
charteris
of
all
people
anne
was
presently
about
the
memorial
edition
of
her
collected
writings
it
was
magnificently
printed
and
when
marketed
achieved
a
flattering
success
robert
etheridge
townsend
was
commissioned
to
write
the
authorized
of
john
and
to
arrange
the
two
volumes
of
anne
was
considered
an
authority
on
literature
and
art
in
general
through
virtue
of
reflected
glory
and
in
the
interviews
she
granted
various
journalists
it
was
noticeable
that
she
no
longer
referred
to
jack
or
to
charteris
but
to
my
husband
to
have
been
his
wife
was
her
one
claim
on
estimation
and
for
the
rest
it
is
inadequate
to
love
the
memory
of
a
martyr
worship
is
demanded
and
so
the
wife
became
the
priestess
ii
into
colonel
musgrave
mental
processes
during
this
period
it
will
not
do
to
pry
too
closely
the
man
had
his
white
nights
and
his
battles
in
part
with
real
grief
and
regret
and
in
part
with
sundry
emotions
which
he
took
on
faith
as
the
emotions
he
ought
to
have
and
therefore
manifestly
suffered
under
patricia
was
my
wife
jack
was
my
brother
ran
his
verdict
in
the
outcome
and
beyond
that
he
did
not
care
to
go
for
death
cowed
his
thoughts
in
the
colonel
explicit
theology
dead
people
were
straightway
conveyed
to
either
one
or
the
other
of
two
places
he
had
very
certainly
never
known
anybody
who
in
his
opinion
merited
the
torments
of
his
orthodox
gehenna
so
that
in
imagination
he
vaguely
populated
its
blazing
corridors
with
nero
and
judas
and
caesar
borgia
and
henry
viii
and
spanish
inquisitors
and
the
aboriginal
american
indians
excepting
of
course
his
ancestress
pocahontas
and
with
benedict
arnold
and
all
the
and
suchlike
other
eminent
practitioners
of
depravity
for
no
one
whom
rudolph
musgrave
had
ever
encountered
in
the
flesh
had
been
really
and
profoundly
wicked
rudolph
musgrave
considered
and
so
he
always
gravely
estimated
acquaintance
after
death
to
be
better
off
poor
fellow
as
the
colonel
phrased
it
with
a
tinge
of
even
if
he
actually
refrained
in
fancy
from
endowing
the
deceased
with
aureate
harps
and
crowns
and
footgear
in
fine
death
cowed
the
colonel
thoughts
beyond
the
grave
they
did
not
care
to
venture
and
when
confronted
with
that
abyss
they
decorously
balked
patricia
and
jack
were
as
a
matter
of
course
better
off
then
and
miraculously
purged
of
faults
with
all
their
defects
somehow
remedied
the
colonel
wife
and
brother
with
agatha
and
the
colonel
other
interred
relatives
were
partaking
of
dignified
joys
in
bright
supernal
iridescent
realms
which
the
colonel
resignedly
looked
forward
to
entering
on
some
comfortably
remote
day
or
another
and
thus
rejoining
his
transfigured
kindred
such
was
the
colonel
charitable
decision
in
the
forming
whereof
logic
was
in
no
way
implicated
for
religion
as
the
colonel
would
have
told
you
sedately
was
not
a
thing
to
be
reasoned
about
attempting
to
do
that
you
became
in
rudolph
musgrave
honest
eyes
regrettably
flippant
meanwhile
cousin
lucy
fentnor
was
taking
care
of
the
colonel
and
little
roger
and
lichfield
long
before
the
lettering
on
patricia
tombstone
had
time
to
lose
its
first
light
dusty
gray
had
accredited
cousin
lucy
fentnor
with
illimitable
willingness
to
become
rudolph
musgrave
upon
proper
solicitation
although
such
is
neither
here
nor
there
for
at
worst
a
widowed
childless
and
impoverished
discreetly
advanced
in
her
forties
was
entitled
to
keep
house
for
the
colonel
in
his
bereavement
as
a
jointly
beneficial
arrangement
without
provoking
scandal
tongue
to
more
than
a
jocose
innuendo
or
two
when
people
met
for
auction
that
perplexing
variant
of
bridge
just
introduced
wherein
you
bid
on
the
suits
and
besides
cousin
lucy
fentnor
as
befitted
any
one
born
an
allardyce
was
to
all
accounts
a
notable
housekeeper
famed
alike
for
the
perilous
glassiness
of
her
hardwood
floors
her
dexterous
management
of
servants
her
familiar
to
every
patron
of
lichfield
charity
bazaars
and
her
unparalleled
jelly
under
cousin
lucy
fentnor
systematized
coddling
little
roger
grew
like
the
proverbial
ill
weed
and
the
colonel
likewise
waxed
perceptibly
in
girth
thus
it
was
that
accident
and
a
woman
intervention
seemed
once
more
to
combine
in
shielding
rudolph
musgrave
from
discomfort
and
in
consequence
it
was
considered
improbable
that
at
this
late
day
the
colonel
would
do
the
proper
thing
by
clarice
pendomer
as
at
the
first
tidings
of
patricia
death
had
been
authentically
rumored
among
the
imaginative
and
in
fact
lichfield
no
longer
considered
that
necessary
the
claim
of
outraged
morality
against
these
two
had
been
thrown
out
of
court
through
some
unworded
social
statute
of
limitation
as
far
as
lichfield
went
of
course
it
was
interesting
to
note
that
the
colonel
called
at
pendomer
rather
frequently
nowadays
but
then
clarice
pendomer
had
all
sorts
of
callers
now
though
not
many
in
skirts
and
she
played
poker
with
men
for
money
until
unregenerate
hours
of
the
night
and
was
reputed
with
a
wealth
of
corroborative
detail
to
have
even
less
discussable
sources
of
income
so
that
indeed
clarice
pendomer
was
now
rather
precariously
retained
within
the
social
pale
through
her
initial
precaution
of
having
been
born
a
bellingham
but
all
such
as
has
been
said
is
quite
beside
the
mark
since
with
the
decadence
of
clarice
pendomer
this
chronicle
has
in
the
outcome
as
scant
concern
as
with
the
marital
aspirations
of
cousin
lucy
fentnor
and
moreover
the
colonel
in
colloquial
phrase
at
least
went
everywhere
after
the
six
months
of
comparative
seclusion
which
decency
exacted
of
his
widowerhood
and
thereby
afforded
him
ample
leisure
to
complete
and
publish
his
legislative
papers
prior
to
the
colonel
be
it
repeated
went
everywhere
and
people
found
him
no
whit
the
worse
company
for
his
black
gloves
and
the
somber
band
stitched
to
his
coatsleeve
so
lichfield
again
received
him
gladly
as
the
social
triumph
of
his
generation
handsome
and
trim
and
affable
no
imaginable
tourist
could
possibly
have
divined
for
everybody
in
lichfield
knew
of
course
that
rudolph
musgrave
had
rounded
his
and
he
stayed
as
ever
invaluable
to
lichfield
matrons
alike
against
the
entertainment
of
an
girl
the
management
of
a
cotillon
and
the
prevention
of
unpleasant
pauses
among
incongruous
but
of
anne
charteris
he
saw
very
little
nowadays
and
indeed
it
was
of
her
own
choice
that
anne
lived
apart
from
lichfieldian
junketings
contented
with
her
dreams
and
her
pride
therein
and
her
remorseful
tender
memories
of
the
things
she
might
have
done
for
jack
and
had
not
done
lived
upon
exalted
levels
nowadays
to
which
the
colonel
more
urbane
bereavement
did
not
aspire
iii
charteris
was
engraved
in
large
raised
letters
upon
the
granite
coping
over
which
anne
stepped
to
enter
the
trim
wherein
her
dead
lay
the
place
is
one
of
the
points
of
interest
in
cedarwood
tourists
passing
through
lichfield
visit
it
as
inevitably
as
they
do
the
graves
of
the
presidents
the
southern
generals
and
the
many
other
famous
people
which
the
old
cemetery
contains
and
the
negro
hackmen
of
lichfield
are
already
profuse
in
inaccurate
information
concerning
its
occupant
in
a
phrase
the
post
card
which
pictures
e
grave
of
john
charteris
is
among
the
seven
similar
misinterpretations
of
localities
most
frequently
demanded
in
lichfieldian
drugstores
and
her
victoria
had
paused
a
trifle
farther
up
the
hill
where
two
big
sycamores
overhung
the
roadway
she
came
into
the
place
alone
walking
quickly
for
she
was
unwarrantably
flustered
by
her
late
encounter
and
when
she
found
of
all
people
rudolph
musgrave
standing
by
her
husband
grave
as
in
a
sort
of
puzzled
and
yet
reverent
meditation
she
was
and
somehow
as
assuring
herself
there
was
no
possible
reason
for
the
repugnance
nay
the
rage
which
a
mere
glimpse
of
trudging
painted
and
flamboyant
clarice
pendomer
had
kindled
yet
it
must
be
recorded
that
anne
had
always
detested
clarice
now
anne
spoke
as
the
phrase
runs
before
she
thought
she
came
with
you
and
he
answered
as
from
the
depths
of
an
comprehension
which
was
distinctly
irritating
yes
and
harry
too
for
that
matter
only
our
talk
got
somehow
to
be
not
quite
the
sort
it
would
be
salutary
for
him
to
take
an
interest
in
so
we
told
harry
to
walk
on
slowly
to
the
gate
and
be
sure
not
to
do
any
number
of
things
he
would
never
have
thought
of
if
we
suggested
them
you
know
how
people
are
with
children
harry
is
her
boy
anne
being
vexed
had
almost
added
and
yours
oh
say
the
et
of
the
pendomer
divorce
case
poor
little
chap
yes
harry
is
her
boy
anne
said
and
again
as
she
perceived
within
the
moment
a
thought
too
expeditiously
i
wish
you
would
bring
them
here
colonel
musgrave
indeed
it
seemed
to
her
flat
desecration
that
musgrave
should
have
brought
his
former
mistress
into
this
hallowed
plot
of
ground
she
did
not
mind
illogically
perhaps
his
bringing
the
child
eh
oh
yes
said
colonel
musgrave
he
was
sensibly
nettled
you
wish
musgrave
would
bring
them
here
but
then
you
see
we
had
been
to
patricia
grave
and
we
remembered
how
jack
stood
by
us
both
when
when
things
bade
fair
to
be
even
more
unpleasant
for
clarice
and
myself
than
they
actually
were
you
should
i
think
grudge
even
such
moral
reprobates
the
privilege
of
being
properly
appreciative
of
what
he
did
for
both
of
us
besides
you
always
come
on
saturdays
you
know
we
could
very
well
anticipate
that
you
would
be
here
this
afternoon
so
he
had
been
at
pains
to
spy
upon
her
anne
phrased
it
thus
in
her
soul
being
irritated
and
crisply
answered
i
am
leaving
lichfield
i
had
meant
this
to
be
my
farewell
to
them
until
october
colonel
musgrave
had
glanced
toward
the
little
headstone
with
its
rather
lengthy
epitaph
which
marked
the
of
this
only
child
and
then
to
the
tall
shaft
whereon
was
engraved
just
john
charteris
the
latter
inscription
was
very
characteristic
of
her
he
reflected
and
yet
reasonable
too
as
one
might
mention
a
hector
or
a
goethe
say
without
being
at
pains
to
disclaim
allusion
to
the
minor
sharers
of
either
name
yes
he
said
well
i
shall
not
intrude
no
wait
she
dissented
her
voice
was
altered
now
for
there
had
come
into
it
a
marvelous
gentleness
and
colonel
musgrave
remained
motionless
the
whole
world
was
motionless
ineffably
expectant
as
it
seemed
to
him
sunset
was
at
hand
on
one
side
was
the
high
wooden
fence
which
showed
the
boundary
of
cedarwood
and
through
its
palings
and
above
it
was
visible
the
broad
shallow
river
comfortably
colored
for
the
most
part
like
au
but
flecked
with
many
patches
of
foam
and
flat
rocks
and
innumerable
islets
some
no
bigger
than
a
but
with
even
the
tiniest
boasting
a
tree
or
two
on
the
other
westward
was
a
mounting
vista
of
turf
and
many
copings
like
magnified
geometrical
problems
and
a
host
of
stunted
growing
things
with
the
staid
verdancy
of
evergreens
predominant
and
a
multitude
of
candid
shafts
and
slabs
and
crosses
and
dwarfed
lambs
and
meditant
angels
some
of
these
thronged
memorials
were
tinged
with
violet
and
others
were
like
silver
just
as
the
ordered
trees
shaded
them
or
no
from
the
low
sun
the
disposition
of
all
worldly
affairs
the
man
dimly
knew
was
very
anciently
prearranged
by
an
illimitable
and
upon
the
whole
a
kindly
wisdom
she
was
considering
the
change
in
him
anne
was
recollecting
that
colonel
musgrave
had
somewhat
pointedly
avoided
her
since
her
widowhood
he
seemed
almost
a
stranger
nowadays
and
she
could
not
recognize
in
the
man
any
resemblance
to
the
boy
whom
she
remembered
so
long
ago
excepting
just
his
womanish
mouth
which
was
as
in
the
old
time
very
full
and
red
and
sensitive
and
illogically
enough
both
this
great
change
in
him
and
this
one
feature
that
had
never
changed
annoyed
her
equally
she
was
also
worried
by
his
odd
tone
of
flippancy
it
jarred
it
vaguely
for
the
phrase
has
no
equivalent
rubbed
her
the
wrong
way
here
at
a
martyr
tomb
it
was
hideously
and
yet
she
did
not
see
her
way
clear
to
rebuke
so
she
remained
silent
but
rudolph
musgrave
was
uncanny
in
some
respects
for
he
said
within
the
moment
i
am
not
a
bit
like
john
charteris
am
i
no
she
answered
quietly
it
had
been
her
actual
thought
anne
stayed
a
tiny
while
quite
motionless
her
eyes
saw
nothing
physical
it
was
the
attitude
colonel
musgrave
reflected
of
one
who
listens
to
a
music
and
incommunicably
you
knew
that
the
music
was
of
a
martial
sort
she
was
all
in
black
of
course
very
slim
and
pure
and
beautiful
the
great
cluster
of
red
roses
loosely
held
was
like
blood
against
the
somber
gown
the
widow
of
john
charteris
in
fine
was
a
very
different
person
from
that
anne
willoughby
whom
rudolph
musgrave
had
loved
so
long
and
long
ago
this
woman
had
tasted
of
tonic
sorrows
unknown
to
rudolph
musgrave
and
had
got
consolation
too
somehow
in
far
uplands
unvisited
by
him
but
he
knew
she
lived
and
was
so
exquisite
mainly
by
virtue
of
that
delusion
which
he
of
all
men
had
preserved
anne
charteris
was
of
his
creation
his
masterpiece
and
viewing
her
he
was
aware
of
great
reverence
and
joy
anne
was
happy
it
was
for
that
he
had
played
but
aloud
i
am
envious
rudolph
musgrave
declared
he
is
the
single
solitary
man
i
ever
knew
whose
widow
was
contented
to
be
simply
his
relict
for
ever
and
ever
amen
for
you
will
always
be
just
the
woman
john
charteris
loved
wo
you
yes
if
you
lived
to
be
years
older
than
methuselah
and
every
genius
and
potentate
in
the
world
should
come
in
the
meantime
it
never
would
occur
to
you
that
you
could
possibly
be
anything
even
to
an
insane
person
except
his
relict
and
he
has
been
dead
now
all
of
three
whole
years
so
i
am
envious
just
as
we
ordinary
mortals
ca
help
being
of
you
both
and
may
i
say
it
i
am
glad
iv
they
were
standing
thus
when
a
boy
of
ten
or
eleven
came
unhurriedly
into
the
section
he
assumed
possession
of
colonel
musgrave
hand
as
though
the
action
were
a
matter
of
course
i
got
lost
colonel
musgrave
the
child
composedly
announced
i
walked
ever
so
far
and
the
gate
was
where
we
left
it
and
the
roads
kept
turning
and
twisting
so
it
seemed
i
never
get
anywhere
i
like
being
lost
when
it
getting
dark
and
there
so
many
dead
people
do
you
the
colonel
was
moved
to
disapproval
young
man
i
suppose
your
poor
deserted
mother
is
looking
for
you
everywhere
and
has
probably
torn
out
every
solitary
strand
of
hair
she
possesses
by
this
time
i
reckon
she
is
the
boy
assented
the
topic
did
not
appear
to
be
in
his
eyes
of
preëminent
importance
then
anne
charteris
said
harry
and
her
voice
was
such
that
rudolph
musgrave
wheeled
with
amazement
in
his
face
the
boy
had
gone
to
her
complaisantly
and
she
stood
now
with
one
hand
on
either
of
his
shoulders
regarding
him
her
lips
were
parted
but
they
did
not
move
at
all
you
are
pendomer
boy
are
you
said
anne
charteris
in
a
while
she
had
some
difficulty
in
articulation
yes
harry
assented
and
we
come
here
every
wednesday
and
please
you
hurtin
me
i
did
mean
to
dear
the
woman
added
painfully
do
interfere
with
me
rudolph
musgrave
your
mother
must
be
very
fond
of
you
harry
i
had
a
little
boy
once
i
was
fond
of
him
he
would
have
been
eleven
years
old
last
february
please
i
was
eleven
till
april
and
i
ai
tall
for
my
age
but
tubby
parsons
says
the
woman
gave
an
odd
unhuman
sound
not
until
april
harry
said
colonel
musgrave
then
an
enormous
whale
is
coming
down
the
river
in
precisely
two
minutes
perhaps
if
you
were
to
look
through
the
palings
of
that
fence
you
might
see
him
i
do
suppose
you
would
care
to
though
and
harry
strolled
resignedly
toward
the
fence
harry
pendomer
did
not
like
this
funny
lady
who
had
hurt
frightened
eyes
he
did
not
believe
in
the
whale
of
course
any
more
than
he
did
in
santa
claus
but
like
most
children
he
patiently
accepted
the
fact
that
grown
people
are
unaccountable
overlords
appointed
by
some
vast
whom
if
only
through
prudential
motives
it
is
preferable
to
humor
v
colonel
musgrave
stood
now
upon
the
other
side
of
john
grave
just
in
the
spot
that
was
reserved
for
her
own
occupancy
some
day
you
are
ill
anne
you
are
not
fit
to
be
out
go
home
i
had
a
little
boy
once
she
said
that
all
past
and
gone
and
good
times
and
bad
times
and
all
times
pass
over
there
an
odd
simple
music
in
the
sentence
is
there
yet
i
remember
it
chiefly
because
i
used
to
read
that
book
to
him
and
he
loved
it
and
it
was
my
child
that
died
why
is
this
other
child
so
like
him
oh
then
that
it
is
it
said
rudolph
musgrave
as
in
relief
bless
me
i
suppose
all
these
little
shavers
are
pretty
much
alike
i
can
only
tell
roger
from
the
other
boys
by
his
red
head
humanity
in
the
raw
you
know
still
it
is
no
wonder
it
gave
you
a
turn
you
had
much
better
go
home
however
and
not
take
any
foolish
risks
and
put
your
feet
in
hot
water
and
rub
cologne
on
your
temples
and
do
all
the
other
suitable
things
i
remember
now
she
continued
without
any
apparent
emotion
and
as
though
he
had
not
spoken
when
i
came
into
the
room
you
were
saying
that
the
child
must
be
considered
you
were
both
very
angry
and
i
was
alarmed
foolishly
alarmed
perhaps
and
my
and
john
charteris
said
him
tell
then
and
you
told
me
the
truth
anne
and
he
sat
quietly
by
oh
if
he
had
the
grace
the
common
manliness
she
shivered
here
but
he
never
interrupted
you
i
i
was
not
looking
at
him
i
was
thinking
how
vile
you
were
and
when
you
had
ended
he
said
dear
i
am
sorry
you
should
have
been
involved
in
this
but
since
you
are
i
think
we
can
assure
rudolph
that
both
of
us
will
regard
his
confidence
as
sacred
then
i
remembered
him
and
thought
how
noble
he
was
and
all
those
years
that
were
so
happy
hour
by
hour
he
was
letting
you
meet
his
bills
she
seemed
to
wrench
out
the
inadequate
metaphor
you
could
hear
the
river
now
faint
as
the
sound
of
boiling
water
after
a
few
pacings
colonel
musgrave
turned
upon
her
he
spoke
with
a
curious
simplicity
there
is
any
use
in
lying
to
you
you
would
believe
you
would
only
go
to
some
one
else
some
woman
probably
who
would
jump
at
the
chance
of
telling
you
everything
and
a
deal
more
yes
there
are
a
great
many
say
floating
about
this
was
the
only
one
that
came
near
being
serious
the
man
was
very
oh
he
was
vulgarly
lecherous
he
was
simply
jack
charteris
he
always
irritated
lichfield
though
by
not
taking
lichfield
very
seriously
you
would
hear
every
of
retaliative
and
mythology
and
in
your
present
state
of
mind
you
would
believe
all
of
them
i
happen
to
know
that
a
great
many
of
these
stories
are
not
true
a
great
many
of
these
stories
anne
repeated
are
true
a
great
many
are
that
ought
to
be
consoling
ought
it
she
spoke
without
a
trace
of
bitterness
i
express
myself
very
badly
what
i
really
mean
what
i
am
aiming
at
is
that
i
wish
you
would
let
me
answer
any
questions
you
might
like
to
ask
because
i
will
answer
them
truthfully
very
few
people
would
you
see
you
go
about
the
world
so
like
a
saint
who
has
just
stepped
down
from
her
niche
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
he
added
as
with
venom
that
it
is
only
human
nature
to
dislike
you
anne
was
not
angry
it
had
come
to
her
quite
as
though
she
were
considering
some
other
woman
that
what
the
man
said
was
in
a
fashion
true
there
is
sunlight
and
fresh
air
in
the
street
john
charteris
had
been
wont
to
declare
and
there
is
a
culvert
at
the
corner
i
think
it
is
a
mistake
for
us
to
emphasize
the
culvert
so
he
had
trained
her
to
disbelieve
in
its
existence
she
saw
this
now
it
did
not
matter
it
seemed
to
her
that
nothing
mattered
any
more
i
only
one
question
i
think
why
did
you
do
it
she
spoke
with
bright
amazement
in
her
eyes
oh
my
dear
my
dear
he
seriocomically
deplored
why
because
it
was
such
a
noble
thing
to
do
it
was
so
like
the
estimable
young
man
in
a
play
you
know
who
acknowledges
the
crime
he
never
committed
and
takes
a
immediately
afterwards
in
fine
i
simply
observed
to
myself
with
the
late
monsieur
de
bergerac
what
a
gesture
and
he
parodied
an
actor
motion
in
this
rôle
she
stayed
unsmiling
and
patiently
awaiting
veracity
anne
did
not
understand
that
colonel
musgrave
was
telling
the
absolute
truth
and
so
you
have
sense
of
humor
he
lamented
you
used
to
have
a
deal
too
before
you
took
to
being
conscientiously
cheerful
and
diffusing
sweetness
and
light
among
your
cowering
associates
well
it
was
because
it
helped
him
a
little
oh
i
am
being
truthful
now
i
had
some
reason
to
dislike
jack
charteris
but
odd
as
it
is
i
know
i
never
did
i
ought
to
have
perhaps
but
i
did
my
friend
you
are
being
almost
truthful
but
i
want
the
truth
entire
it
is
polite
to
disbelieve
people
he
reproved
her
or
at
the
very
least
according
to
the
best
books
on
etiquette
you
ought
not
to
do
it
audibly
would
you
mind
if
i
smoked
i
could
be
more
veracious
then
there
is
something
in
tobacco
that
makes
frankness
a
matter
of
course
i
thank
you
he
produced
an
amber
holder
fitted
a
cigarette
into
it
and
presently
inhaled
twice
he
said
with
a
curt
voice
the
reason
naturally
was
you
you
may
remember
certain
things
that
happened
just
before
john
charteris
came
and
took
you
oh
that
is
precisely
what
he
did
you
are
rather
a
woman
now
in
consequence
or
in
my
humble
opinion
at
least
and
deplorably
superior
it
pleased
the
man
to
have
in
his
house
if
you
will
overlook
my
venturing
into
metaphor
one
cool
room
very
sparsely
furnished
where
he
could
come
when
the
mood
seized
him
he
took
the
raw
material
from
me
wherewith
to
build
that
room
because
he
wanted
that
room
i
acquiesced
because
i
had
not
the
skill
wherewith
to
fight
him
anne
understood
him
now
as
with
a
great
drench
of
surprise
and
fear
was
what
she
felt
in
chief
when
she
saw
for
just
this
moment
as
though
it
had
lightened
the
man
face
transfigured
and
tender
and
strange
to
her
i
tried
to
buy
your
happiness
to
yes
just
to
keep
you
blind
indefinitely
had
the
price
been
heavier
i
would
have
paid
it
the
more
gladly
fate
has
played
a
sorry
trick
would
never
have
seen
through
him
my
dear
i
have
wanted
very
often
to
shake
you
he
said
and
she
knew
in
a
glorious
terror
that
she
desired
him
to
shake
her
and
as
she
had
never
desired
anything
else
in
life
oh
well
i
am
just
a
common
ordinary
of
fool
the
musgraves
always
are
in
one
fashion
or
another
he
sulkily
concluded
and
now
the
demigod
was
merely
rudolph
musgrave
again
and
she
was
not
afraid
any
longer
but
only
inexpressibly
fordone
is
that
like
a
woman
he
presently
demanded
of
the
june
heavens
to
drag
something
out
of
a
man
with
inflexibility
monomania
and
moral
and
not
like
it
oh
very
well
i
am
disgusted
by
your
sex
axiomatic
variability
i
shall
take
harry
to
his
fond
mamma
at
once
she
did
not
say
anything
a
certain
new
discovery
obsessed
her
like
a
piece
of
piercing
music
then
rudolph
musgrave
gave
the
tiniest
of
gestures
downward
and
i
have
told
you
this
in
chief
because
we
two
remember
him
he
wanted
you
he
took
you
you
are
his
you
will
always
be
he
gave
you
just
a
fragment
of
himself
that
fragment
was
worth
more
than
everything
i
had
to
offer
anne
very
carefully
arranged
her
roses
on
the
grave
i
do
not
know
meanwhile
i
give
these
to
our
master
and
my
real
widowhood
begins
and
as
she
rose
he
looked
at
her
across
the
colorful
mound
and
smiled
half
as
with
embarrassment
a
lie
he
thought
might
ameliorate
the
situation
and
he
bravely
hazarded
a
prodigious
one
is
it
necessary
to
tell
you
that
jack
loved
you
and
that
the
others
never
really
counted
he
rejoiced
to
see
that
anne
believed
him
no
she
assented
no
not
with
him
oddly
enough
i
am
proud
of
that
even
now
but
do
you
see
i
never
loved
him
i
was
just
his
priestess
the
priestess
of
a
stucco
god
otherwise
i
would
know
it
was
his
fault
but
altogether
that
of
the
others
he
grimaced
and
gave
a
bantering
flirt
of
his
head
he
said
with
quizzing
eyes
would
it
do
any
good
to
quote
lombroso
and
maudsley
and
gall
and
and
flechsig
and
so
on
and
to
tell
you
that
the
excessive
use
of
one
brain
faculty
must
necessarily
cause
a
lack
of
nutriment
to
all
the
other
it
would
be
rather
there
is
a
deal
i
could
tell
you
also
as
to
what
poisonous
blood
he
inherited
but
to
do
this
i
have
not
the
right
and
then
rudolph
musgrave
said
in
all
sincerity
wild
impetuous
whirlwind
of
passion
and
faculty
slumbered
quiet
there
such
heavenly
dwelling
in
the
heart
of
it
she
had
put
aside
alike
the
drolling
and
the
palliative
suggestion
like
flimsy
veils
i
think
it
would
do
any
good
whatever
when
growing
things
are
broken
by
the
whirlwind
they
do
as
a
rule
discuss
the
theory
of
as
a
consolation
men
such
as
he
was
take
what
they
desire
it
is
fair
to
us
others
but
it
true
for
all
that
their
eyes
met
warily
and
for
no
reason
which
they
shared
in
common
they
smiled
together
poor
little
lady
of
shalott
said
rudolph
musgrave
the
mirror
is
cracked
from
side
to
side
is
it
i
am
sorry
for
life
is
not
so
easily
disposed
of
and
there
is
only
life
to
look
at
now
and
life
is
a
bewilderingly
complex
business
you
will
find
because
the
laws
of
it
are
so
childishly
simple
and
implacable
and
one
of
these
laws
seems
to
be
that
in
our
little
planet
might
makes
right
he
stayed
to
puff
his
cigarette
oh
rudolph
dear
do
do
be
just
a
she
cried
impulsively
before
he
had
time
to
continue
which
she
perceived
he
meant
to
do
as
if
it
did
not
matter
and
he
took
her
full
meaning
quite
as
he
had
been
used
in
the
old
times
to
discourse
upon
a
i
am
afraid
i
am
that
rather
he
said
reflectively
but
then
clarice
and
i
could
hardly
have
weathered
scandal
except
by
making
ourselves
particularly
agreeable
to
everybody
and
somehow
i
got
into
the
habit
of
making
people
laugh
it
is
very
difficult
i
am
rather
an
adept
at
telling
stories
which
just
graze
impropriety
for
instance
you
know
they
call
me
the
social
triumph
of
my
generation
and
people
are
glad
to
see
me
because
i
am
awfully
funny
and
killing
and
so
on
and
i
suppose
it
tells
in
the
long
run
like
the
dyer
hand
you
know
it
does
tell
anne
was
thinking
it
would
always
tell
and
that
too
would
be
john
charteris
handiwork
ensued
a
silence
rudolph
musgrave
was
painstakingly
intent
upon
his
cigarette
a
bird
called
to
his
mate
impatiently
then
anne
shook
her
head
impatiently
come
while
i
thinking
i
will
drive
you
back
to
lichfield
oh
no
that
would
do
at
all
he
said
with
absolute
decision
no
you
see
i
have
to
return
the
boy
and
i
ca
quite
imagine
your
carriage
waiting
at
the
doors
of
mrs
pendomer
oh
anne
fleetingly
thought
would
have
understood
but
aloud
she
only
said
and
do
you
think
i
hate
her
any
longer
yes
it
is
true
i
hated
her
until
and
now
i
just
sincerely
sorry
for
her
for
she
and
i
and
you
and
even
the
child
yonder
and
all
that
any
of
us
is
are
just
so
many
relics
of
john
charteris
yet
he
has
done
with
us
at
last
she
said
this
with
an
inhalation
of
the
breath
but
she
did
not
look
at
him
take
care
he
said
with
an
unreasonable
harshness
for
i
forewarn
you
i
am
imagining
vain
things
i
not
afraid
somehow
but
anne
did
not
look
at
him
he
saw
as
with
a
rending
shock
how
like
the
widow
of
john
charteris
was
to
anne
willoughby
and
unforgotten
pulses
very
strange
and
irrational
and
dear
perplexed
him
sorely
he
debated
and
flung
aside
the
cigarette
as
an
detail
of
his
hobbling
part
you
say
i
did
a
noble
thing
for
you
i
tried
to
but
quixotism
has
its
price
i
am
not
quite
the
man
who
did
that
thing
john
charteris
has
set
his
imprint
too
deep
upon
us
we
served
his
pleasure
we
are
not
any
longer
the
boy
and
girl
who
loved
each
other
she
waited
in
the
rising
twilight
with
a
yet
averted
face
the
world
was
motionless
ineffably
expectant
as
it
seemed
to
him
and
the
disposition
of
all
worldly
affairs
the
man
dimly
knew
was
very
anciently
prearranged
by
an
illimitable
and
upon
the
whole
a
kindly
wisdom
so
that
my
dear
my
dear
he
swiftly
said
i
do
think
i
can
word
just
what
my
feeling
is
for
you
always
my
view
of
the
world
has
been
that
you
existed
and
that
some
other
people
existed
as
accessories
then
he
was
silent
for
a
appraising
her
his
hands
lifted
toward
her
and
fell
within
the
moment
as
if
it
were
in
impotence
anne
spoke
at
last
and
the
sweet
voice
of
her
was
very
glad
and
proud
and
confident
my
friend
remember
that
i
have
not
thanked
you
you
have
done
the
most
foolish
and
the
manliest
thing
i
ever
knew
a
man
to
do
just
for
my
sake
and
i
have
accepted
it
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
course
and
i
shall
always
do
so
because
it
was
your
right
to
do
this
very
brave
and
foolish
thing
for
me
i
know
you
joyed
in
doing
it
rudolph
you
can
not
understand
how
glad
i
am
you
joyed
in
doing
it
their
eyes
met
it
is
not
possible
to
tell
you
all
they
were
aware
of
through
that
moment
because
it
is
a
knowledge
so
rarely
apprehended
and
even
then
for
such
a
little
while
that
no
man
who
has
sensed
it
can
remember
afterward
aught
save
the
splendor
and
perfection
of
it
and
yet
anne
looked
back
once
there
was
just
the
tall
stark
shaft
and
on
it
john
charteris
the
thing
was
ominous
and
vast
all
colored
like
wet
gravel
save
where
the
sunlight
tipped
it
with
clean
silver
very
high
above
their
reach
come
she
quickly
said
to
rudolph
musgrave
come
for
i
am
afraid
vi
and
are
we
then
to
leave
them
with
glad
faces
turned
to
that
new
day
wherein
above
the
ashes
of
old
errors
and
follies
and
mischances
and
miseries
they
were
to
raise
the
structure
of
such
a
happiness
as
earth
rarely
witnesses
would
it
not
be
instead
a
grateful
task
more
fully
to
depicture
how
rudolph
musgrave
love
of
anne
won
finally
to
its
reward
and
these
two
shared
the
evening
of
their
lives
in
tranquil
service
of
unswerving
love
come
to
its
own
at
last
undoubtedly
since
the
espousal
of
one
first
love
by
oneself
is
a
phenomenon
rarely
encountered
outside
of
popular
fiction
it
would
be
a
very
gratifying
task
to
record
that
anne
and
rudolph
musgrave
were
married
that
autumn
that
subsequently
lichfield
was
astounded
by
the
fervor
of
their
bliss
that
colonel
and
the
second
musgrave
were
universally
respected
in
a
word
and
their
were
always
prominently
chronicled
by
the
and
that
anne
took
excellent
care
of
little
roger
and
that
she
and
her
second
husband
proved
eminently
suited
to
each
other
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
one
of
these
things
ever
happened
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
anne
deplored
oh
rudolph
dear
i
perfectly
realize
you
are
the
best
and
noblest
man
i
ever
knew
and
i
have
always
loved
you
very
much
my
dear
that
is
why
i
could
never
abide
poor
pendomer
and
yet
it
is
a
feeling
i
simply
explain
that
you
belong
to
jack
in
spite
of
everything
the
colonel
said
why
but
of
course
i
might
have
known
that
jack
would
never
have
allowed
any
simple
incidental
happening
such
as
his
death
to
cause
his
missing
a
possible
trick
anne
would
have
comforted
rudolph
musgrave
but
to
her
discomfiture
the
colonel
was
grinning
however
ruefully
i
was
thinking
he
stated
of
the
only
time
that
i
ever
to
my
knowledge
talked
face
to
face
with
the
devil
it
is
rather
odd
how
obstinately
life
clings
to
the
most
hackneyed
trick
of
and
still
naively
pretends
to
enrich
her
productions
by
the
stale
device
of
introducing
a
refrain
so
that
the
idlest
remarks
of
as
much
as
three
years
ago
keep
cropping
up
as
the
actual
gist
of
the
present
however
were
it
within
my
power
i
would
evoke
amaimon
straightway
now
to
come
up
yonder
through
your
hearthrug
and
to
answer
me
quite
honestly
if
i
did
not
tell
him
on
the
beach
at
matocton
that
this
precisely
this
would
be
the
outcome
of
your
knowing
everything
i
told
you
that
i
could
quite
anne
said
eh
but
i
can
my
dear
he
informed
her
the
explanation
is
that
lichfield
bore
us
shaped
us
and
made
us
what
we
are
we
may
not
enjoy
a
monopoly
of
the
virtues
here
in
lichfield
but
there
is
one
trait
at
least
which
the
children
of
lichfield
share
in
common
we
are
loyal
we
give
but
once
and
when
we
give
we
give
all
that
we
have
and
when
we
have
once
given
it
neither
nor
a
concourse
of
expostulating
seraphim
nor
anything
else
in
the
universe
can
induce
us
to
believe
that
a
retraction
or
even
a
qualification
of
the
gift
would
be
quite
worthy
of
us
but
that
that
foolish
why
it
unreasonable
anne
pointed
out
of
course
it
is
and
that
is
why
i
am
proud
of
lichfield
and
that
is
why
you
are
jack
wife
and
always
will
be
just
jack
wife
and
why
i
am
patricia
husband
and
why
lichfield
is
lichfield
there
is
something
braver
in
life
than
to
be
just
reasonable
thank
god
and
so
we
keep
the
faith
my
dear
however
obsolete
we
find
fidelity
to
be
we
keep
to
the
old
faith
we
of
lichfield
who
have
given
hostages
to
the
past
we
remember
even
now
that
we
gave
freely
in
an
old
time
and
did
not
haggle
and
so
we
are
proud
yes
we
are
consumedly
proud
and
we
know
that
we
have
earned
the
right
to
be
proud
a
little
later
colonel
musgrave
said
and
yet
it
takes
a
monstrous
while
to
dispose
of
our
subtleties
i
have
loved
you
my
whole
life
long
as
accurately
as
we
can
phrase
these
matters
there
is
no
no
reason
why
you
should
not
marry
me
now
and
you
would
marry
me
if
i
pressed
it
and
i
do
not
press
it
perhaps
it
all
comes
of
our
both
having
been
reared
in
lichfield
perhaps
that
is
why
i
too
have
been
it
over
you
see
he
added
with
a
smile
the
rivet
in
grandfather
neck
is
not
lightly
to
be
ignored
after
all
no
you
do
not
know
what
i
am
talking
about
my
dear
and
well
anyhow
i
belong
to
patricia
upon
the
whole
i
am
glad
that
i
belong
to
patricia
for
patricia
and
what
patricia
meant
to
me
was
the
one
vital
thing
in
a
certain
person
rather
existence
oh
yes
in
spite
of
everything
i
know
it
now
anne
charteris
the
colonel
cried
i
would
marry
you
or
any
other
woman
breathing
even
though
you
were
to
kneel
and
implore
me
upon
the
knees
of
a
centipede
for
i
belong
to
patricia
and
the
rivet
stays
unbroken
after
all
oh
and
am
i
being
very
foolish
again
anne
asked
for
i
have
been
remembering
that
when
when
jack
was
not
quite
truthful
about
some
things
you
know
the
truth
he
hid
was
always
one
which
would
have
hurt
me
and
i
like
to
believe
that
was
at
least
in
part
the
reason
he
hid
it
rudolph
so
he
purchased
my
happiness
well
at
ugly
prices
perhaps
but
he
purchased
it
none
the
less
and
i
had
it
through
all
those
years
so
why
should
i
after
all
be
very
grateful
to
him
and
besides
her
voice
broke
besides
he
was
jack
you
know
he
belonged
to
me
what
does
it
matter
what
he
did
he
belonged
to
me
and
i
loved
him
and
to
the
colonel
discomfort
anne
began
to
cry
there
there
he
said
so
the
real
truth
is
out
at
last
and
tears
do
help
very
much
it
does
seem
a
bit
unfair
my
dear
i
know
but
that
is
simply
because
you
and
i
are
living
in
a
universe
which
has
never
actually
committed
itself
under
any
penalizing
bond
to
be
entirely
candid
as
to
the
laws
by
which
it
is
conducted
but
it
may
be
that
rudolph
musgrave
voiced
quite
obsolete
views
for
he
said
this
at
a
very
remote
period
when
the
beef
trust
was
being
investigated
in
washington
when
an
excited
iberian
constabulary
was
still
hunting
the
anarchists
who
had
attempted
to
assassinate
the
young
king
and
queen
of
spain
upon
their
when
the
rebuilding
of
an
san
francisco
was
just
beginning
to
be
talked
of
as
a
possibility
and
when
editorials
were
mostly
devoted
to
discussion
of
what
bryan
would
have
to
say
about
when
he
returned
from
his
foreign
tour
and
besides
it
was
rudolph
musgrave
besetting
infirmity
always
to
shrink
under
shelter
of
whatever
grandiloquent
excuse
from
making
changes
one
may
permissibly
estimate
this
foible
to
have
weighed
with
him
a
little
even
now
just
as
in
all
things
it
had
always
weighed
in
lichfield
with
all
his
generation
an
old
custom
is
not
lightly
broken
part
ten
imprimis
so
let
us
laugh
lest
vain
rememberings
breed
as
of
old
some
rude
bucolic
cry
of
awkward
anguishes
of
dreams
that
die
without
decorum
of
love
lacking
wings
yet
striving
in
his
flounderings
eternally
as
now
even
when
i
lie
as
i
lie
now
who
know
that
you
and
i
exist
and
heed
not
lesser
happenings
i
was
i
am
i
will
be
eh
no
doubt
for
some
sufficient
cause
i
drift
defer
equivocate
dream
hazard
grow
more
stout
age
am
no
longer
love
idolater
and
yet
i
could
and
would
not
live
without
your
faith
that
heartens
and
your
doubts
which
spur
lionel
crochard
i
so
weeks
and
months
and
presently
irrevocable
years
passed
tranquilly
and
nothing
very
important
seemed
to
happen
nowadays
either
for
good
or
ill
and
rudolph
musgrave
was
content
enough
true
there
befell
and
with
increasing
frequency
periods
when
one
must
lie
abed
and
be
coaxed
into
taking
interminable
medicines
and
be
ministered
unto
generally
because
one
was
of
a
certain
age
nowadays
and
must
be
prudent
but
even
such
necessities
these
underhanded
indignities
of
time
had
their
alleviations
trained
nurses
for
example
were
uncommonly
and
agreeable
young
women
when
you
came
to
know
them
and
quite
too
for
all
that
in
our
days
these
girls
had
to
work
for
their
living
unthinkable
as
it
seemed
the
colonel
found
that
his
a
miss
ramsay
was
actually
by
birth
a
ramsay
of
blenheim
and
for
a
little
the
discovery
depressed
him
but
to
be
made
much
of
upon
whatever
terms
was
always
treatment
to
which
the
colonel
submitted
only
too
docilely
and
besides
in
this
queer
comfortable
just
state
the
colonel
found
one
had
the
drollest
dreams
evolving
fancies
such
as
were
really
a
credit
to
one
imagination
for
instance
one
very
often
imagined
that
patricia
was
more
close
at
hand
nowadays
no
she
was
not
here
in
the
room
of
course
but
outside
in
the
street
at
the
corner
below
where
the
letterbox
stood
yes
she
was
undoubtedly
there
the
colonel
reflected
drowsily
and
they
had
been
so
certain
her
return
could
only
result
in
unhappiness
and
they
were
so
wise
that
whilst
she
waited
for
her
opportunity
patricia
herself
began
to
be
a
little
uneasy
she
had
patrolled
the
block
six
times
before
the
chance
came
and
it
seemed
to
rudolph
musgrave
drowsily
pleased
by
his
own
inventiveness
that
patricia
was
glad
this
afternoon
was
so
hot
that
no
one
was
abroad
except
the
small
boy
at
the
corner
house
who
sat
upon
the
bottom
and
as
children
so
often
do
appeared
intently
to
appraise
the
world
at
large
with
an
inexplicable
air
of
disappointment
now
think
how
rudolph
would
feel
the
colonel
whimsically
played
at
reading
patricia
reflection
if
i
were
to
be
arrested
as
a
suspicious
character
that
what
the
newspapers
always
call
them
i
think
on
his
very
doorstep
and
he
must
have
been
home
a
ago
at
least
because
i
know
it
after
five
but
the
latched
and
i
ring
the
if
only
because
it
would
be
too
ridiculous
to
have
to
ask
the
maid
to
tell
colonel
musgrave
his
wife
wanted
to
see
him
besides
i
do
know
the
new
i
wish
now
we
had
let
old
mary
go
even
though
she
was
so
undependable
about
and
it
seemed
to
rudolph
musgrave
that
patricia
was
tired
of
pacing
before
the
row
of
houses
each
so
like
the
other
and
compared
herself
to
gulliver
astray
upon
a
brobdingnagian
bookshelf
which
held
a
library
set
of
some
huge
author
she
had
lost
interest
too
in
the
new
house
upon
the
other
side
if
things
were
different
i
would
have
to
call
on
them
but
as
it
is
i
am
spared
that
bother
at
least
said
patricia
just
as
if
being
dead
did
not
change
people
at
all
then
a
colored
woman
trim
and
came
out
of
the
watched
house
she
bore
some
eight
or
nine
letters
in
one
hand
and
fanned
herself
with
them
in
a
leisurely
progress
to
the
mailbox
at
the
lower
corner
she
looks
capable
was
patricia
grudging
commentary
in
slipping
through
the
doorway
into
the
twilight
of
the
hall
but
it
is
safe
to
leave
the
open
like
this
one
never
knows
no
i
can
tell
by
the
look
of
her
she
the
sort
that
ca
be
induced
to
sleep
on
the
lot
and
takes
mysterious
bundles
home
at
night
ii
and
it
seemed
to
rudolph
musgrave
now
in
the
full
flow
of
this
droll
dream
that
patricia
resentfully
noted
her
had
been
meddled
with
this
much
alone
might
patricia
observe
in
a
swift
transit
to
the
parlor
she
waited
there
until
the
maid
returned
and
registered
to
the
credit
the
discreet
soft
closing
of
the
and
afterward
the
inaudible
swish
of
the
rear
door
of
the
as
the
maid
went
back
into
the
kitchen
in
any
event
patricia
largely
conceded
she
probably
does
clash
the
knives
and
forks
in
the
pantry
after
supper
like
she
was
hostile
armaments
with
any
number
of
cutlasses
apiece
i
remember
rudolph
simply
could
stand
it
when
we
had
ethel
so
much
was
satisfactory
only
her
parlor
was
so
altered
there
was
to
give
you
just
her
instantaneous
first
impression
so
little
in
it
broad
spaces
of
plain
color
showed
everywhere
and
patricia
ideal
of
what
a
parlor
should
be
as
befitted
the
châtelaine
of
a
fine
home
in
lichfield
had
always
been
the
tangled
elegancies
of
the
front
of
a
woman
exchange
for
fancy
work
the
room
had
even
been
repapered
odiously
as
she
considered
and
the
shiny
floor
of
it
boasted
just
three
inefficient
rugs
like
dingy
rafts
upon
a
sea
of
very
strong
coffee
patricia
looked
in
vain
for
her
grandiose
chairs
her
immaculate
tidies
and
the
proud
yellow
lambrequin
embroidered
in
high
relief
with
white
gardenias
which
had
formerly
adorned
the
mantelpiece
the
heart
of
her
hungered
for
her
unforgotten
and
unforgettable
papering
wherein
white
roses
bloomed
exuberantly
against
a
yellow
background
which
deplorably
faded
if
you
did
not
keep
the
down
she
remembered
and
she
wanted
back
her
white
thick
comfortable
carpet
which
hid
the
floor
completely
so
that
everywhere
you
trod
upon
the
buxomest
of
stalwart
yellow
roses
each
bunch
of
which
was
lavishly
tied
with
ribbons
then
too
her
cherished
at
least
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
which
had
looked
so
pretty
after
she
had
gilded
it
and
added
a
knot
of
pink
sarsenet
was
departed
and
gone
as
well
was
the
table
with
its
array
of
china
swan
and
frogs
and
artistically
grouped
about
its
speckless
surface
even
her
prized
engraving
of
michael
angelo
buonarotti
contentedly
regarding
his
just
finished
moses
while
a
pope
tiptoed
into
the
room
through
a
had
been
removed
with
all
its
splendors
of
and
intricate
just
here
and
there
in
fine
like
a
familiar
face
in
a
crowd
she
could
discover
some
one
of
her
more
parlor
ornaments
and
the
whole
history
of
it
its
donor
or
else
its
price
the
gestures
of
the
shopman
even
what
sort
of
weather
it
was
when
she
and
rudolph
found
exactly
what
i
been
looking
for
in
the
and
the
stapyltonian
haggling
over
the
price
with
which
patricia
had
bargained
such
unimportant
details
as
these
now
vividly
awakened
in
recollection
in
fine
this
room
was
not
her
parlor
at
all
and
in
it
patricia
was
lonely
yes
yes
she
would
be
nowadays
the
colonel
reflected
for
he
himself
had
never
been
in
thorough
sympathy
with
all
the
changes
made
by
roger
young
wife
thus
it
was
with
the
first
floor
of
the
house
through
which
patricia
strayed
with
uniform
discomfort
this
place
was
home
no
longer
thus
it
was
with
the
first
floor
of
the
house
everywhere
the
equipments
were
strange
or
at
best
arranged
not
quite
as
patricia
would
have
placed
them
yet
they
had
not
any
look
of
being
recently
purchased
even
that
hideous
was
a
little
worn
she
noted
as
noiselessly
she
mounted
to
the
second
story
the
house
was
perfectly
quiet
save
for
a
tiny
shrill
continuance
of
melody
that
somehow
seemed
only
to
pierce
the
silence
not
to
dispel
it
rudolph
of
all
things
had
in
her
absence
acquired
a
canary
and
everybody
knew
what
an
interminable
nuisance
a
canary
was
she
entered
the
front
room
it
had
been
her
bedroom
ever
since
her
marriage
she
remembered
this
as
with
a
gush
of
defiant
joy
iii
so
it
seemed
to
rudolph
musgrave
that
patricia
came
actually
into
the
room
that
had
been
hers
a
canary
was
singing
there
very
sweet
and
shrill
and
as
in
defiant
joy
its
trilling
seemed
to
fill
the
room
in
the
brief
pauses
of
his
song
the
old
clock
from
which
rudolph
had
removed
the
pendulum
on
the
night
of
agatha
death
would
interpose
an
obstinate
slow
ticking
and
immediately
the
would
be
drowned
in
melody
otherwise
the
room
was
silent
in
the
alcove
stood
the
bed
which
had
been
patricia
intent
upon
its
occupant
were
three
persons
with
their
backs
turned
to
her
one
patricia
could
easily
divine
to
be
a
doctor
he
was
twiddling
a
hypodermic
syringe
between
his
fingers
and
the
set
of
his
shoulders
was
that
of
acquiescence
profiles
of
the
others
she
saw
one
a
passive
nurse
in
uniform
who
was
patiently
chafing
the
right
hand
of
the
occupant
the
other
a
stranger
who
sat
crouched
in
his
chair
and
held
the
dying
man
left
hand
for
in
the
bed
supported
by
many
pillows
and
facing
patricia
was
a
dying
man
he
was
very
old
having
thick
tumbled
hair
which
like
his
beard
was
uniformly
white
his
eyelids
drooped
a
trifle
so
that
he
seemed
to
meditate
concerning
something
ineffably
remote
and
serious
yet
not
upon
the
whole
unsatisfactory
you
saw
and
heard
the
intake
of
each
breath
so
painfully
drawn
and
expelled
with
manifest
relief
as
if
the
man
were
very
tired
of
breathing
yet
the
bedclothes
heaved
with
his
vain
efforts
just
to
keep
on
breathing
and
sometimes
his
parted
lips
would
twitch
curiously
rudolph
musgrave
too
could
see
all
this
quite
plainly
in
the
mirror
over
the
mantel
the
doctor
spoke
yes
it
the
end
professor
musgrave
he
said
for
this
stranger
to
whom
the
doctor
spoke
a
pedagogue
to
his
had
once
been
patricia
chubby
baby
roger
and
rudolph
musgrave
stayed
motionless
he
knew
patricia
was
there
but
that
fact
no
longer
seemed
either
very
strange
or
even
unnatural
and
besides
it
was
against
some
law
for
him
to
look
at
her
until
patricia
had
called
him
meanwhile
just
opposite
above
the
mirror
and
facing
him
was
the
stuart
portrait
of
young
gerald
musgrave
this
picture
had
now
hung
there
for
a
great
many
years
the
boy
still
smiled
at
you
in
undiminished
raillery
even
though
he
smiled
ambiguously
and
with
a
sort
of
humorous
sadness
in
his
eyes
once
very
long
ago
when
the
picture
hung
downstairs
some
one
had
said
that
gerald
life
was
barren
the
dying
man
could
not
now
recollect
quite
who
that
person
was
rudolph
musgrave
stayed
motionless
he
comprehended
that
he
was
dying
the
greatest
of
all
changes
was
at
hand
and
he
who
had
always
shrunk
from
making
changes
was
now
content
enough
indeed
with
rudolph
musgrave
living
had
always
been
a
vaguely
dissatisfactory
business
a
proceeding
which
he
had
scrambled
through
as
he
saw
now
without
any
worthy
aim
or
even
any
intelligible
purpose
he
had
nothing
very
heinous
with
which
to
reproach
himself
but
upon
the
other
side
he
had
most
certainly
nothing
of
which
to
be
particularly
proud
so
this
was
all
that
living
came
to
you
heard
of
other
people
being
rapt
by
splendid
sins
and
splendid
virtues
and
you
anticipated
that
some
such
majestic
energy
would
transfigure
your
own
living
and
change
everything
but
the
great
adventure
never
arrived
somehow
and
the
days
were
frittered
away
piecemeal
what
with
eating
your
dinner
and
taking
a
wholesome
walk
and
checking
up
your
bank
account
and
dovetailing
scraps
of
parish
registers
and
and
county
records
into
an
irrefutable
pedigree
and
seeing
that
your
clothes
were
pressed
and
looking
over
the
newspapers
and
what
with
other
infinitesimal
avocations
each
one
innocent
none
of
any
particular
importance
and
each
consuming
an
irrevocable
moment
of
the
allotted
time
until
at
last
you
found
that
living
had
not
necessarily
any
climax
at
all
and
patricia
would
call
him
presently
once
very
long
ago
some
one
had
said
that
the
most
pathetic
tragedy
in
life
was
to
get
nothing
in
particular
out
of
it
the
dying
man
could
not
now
recollect
quite
who
that
person
was
he
wondered
vaguely
what
might
have
been
the
outcome
if
rudolph
musgrave
had
sought
not
waited
for
the
great
adventure
if
rudolph
musgrave
had
put
however
irrationally
more
energy
and
less
into
living
if
rudolph
musgrave
had
not
been
contented
to
be
just
a
musgrave
of
matocton
well
it
was
too
late
now
he
viewed
his
whole
life
now
in
epitome
and
much
as
you
may
see
at
night
the
hackneyed
vista
from
your
window
leap
to
incisiveness
under
the
lash
of
lightning
no
the
life
of
rudolph
musgrave
had
never
risen
to
the
plane
of
dignity
not
even
to
that
of
seeming
to
rudolph
musgrave
a
connected
and
really
important
transaction
on
rudolph
musgrave
part
yet
lichfield
none
the
better
for
rudolph
having
lived
was
none
the
worse
thank
heaven
and
there
were
younger
men
in
lichfield
men
who
did
not
mean
to
fail
as
rudolph
musgrave
and
his
fellows
all
had
failed
eh
yes
what
was
the
toast
that
rudolph
musgrave
drank
so
long
ago
to
the
new
lichfield
which
these
younger
men
were
making
to
this
new
south
that
has
not
any
longer
need
of
me
or
of
my
kind
to
this
new
south
she
does
not
gaze
unwillingly
nor
too
complacently
upon
old
years
and
dares
concede
that
but
with
loss
of
manliness
may
any
man
encroach
upon
the
heritage
of
a
dog
or
of
a
and
consider
the
exploits
of
an
ancestor
to
guarantee
an
innate
and
personal
excellence
for
to
her
all
former
glory
is
less
a
jewel
than
a
touchstone
and
with
her
portion
of
it
daily
she
appraises
her
own
doing
and
without
vain
speech
and
her
high
past
she
values
now
in
chief
as
fit
foundation
of
that
edifice
whereon
she
labors
day
by
day
and
with
augmenting
strokes
yes
that
was
it
and
it
was
true
yet
rudolph
musgrave
life
on
earth
was
ending
now
the
only
life
that
he
would
ever
have
on
earth
and
it
had
never
risen
to
the
plane
of
seeming
even
to
rudolph
musgrave
a
really
important
transaction
on
rudolph
musgrave
part
then
patricia
spoke
low
and
very
low
she
called
to
olaf
and
the
dim
wistful
eyes
of
rudolph
musgrave
lifted
and
gazed
full
upon
her
standing
there
and
were
no
longer
wistful
and
the
man
made
as
though
to
rise
and
could
not
and
his
face
was
very
glad
for
in
the
dying
man
had
awakened
the
pulses
of
an
old
strange
magic
and
all
his
old
delight
in
the
girl
who
had
shared
in
and
had
provoked
this
ancient
together
with
a
quite
new
consciousness
of
the
inseparability
of
patricia
foibles
from
his
existence
so
that
he
was
incuriously
aware
of
his
imbecility
in
not
having
known
always
that
patricia
must
come
back
some
day
not
as
a
glorious
unfamiliar
angel
but
unaltered
i
am
glad
you
have
changed
why
but
of
course
nothing
would
have
counted
if
you
had
changed
not
even
for
the
better
patricia
for
you
and
what
you
meant
to
me
were
real
that
only
was
real
that
we
not
being
demigods
but
being
just
what
we
were
once
climbed
together
very
high
where
we
could
glimpse
the
stars
and
nothing
else
can
ever
be
of
any
importance
what
we
inherited
was
too
much
for
us
was
it
not
my
dear
and
now
it
is
not
formidable
any
longer
oh
but
i
loved
you
very
greatly
patricia
and
now
at
last
my
dear
i
seem
to
understand
as
in
that
old
old
time
when
you
and
i
were
glad
together
but
he
did
not
say
this
aloud
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
stood
in
a
cool
pleasant
garden
and
that
patricia
came
toward
him
through
the
long
shadows
of
sunset
the
lacy
folds
and
furbelows
and
that
clothed
her
were
now
tinged
with
gold
and
now
as
a
hedge
or
a
flower
bed
screened
her
from
the
level
rays
were
softened
into
multitudinous
graduations
of
grays
and
mauves
and
violets
they
did
not
speak
but
in
her
eyes
he
found
compassion
and
such
tenderness
as
awed
him
and
then
as
a
light
is
puffed
out
they
were
the
eyes
of
a
friendly
stranger
he
understood
for
an
instant
that
of
necessity
it
was
decreed
time
must
turn
back
and
everything
even
rudolph
musgrave
be
just
as
it
had
been
when
he
first
saw
patricia
for
they
had
made
nothing
of
their
lives
and
so
they
must
begin
all
over
again
is
not
he
was
saying
cousin
rudolph
are
you
she
asked
and
rudolph
musgrave
knew
he
had
forgotten
something
of
vast
import
but
what
this
knowledge
had
pertained
to
he
no
longer
knew
then
rudolph
musgrave
noted
with
a
delicious
tingling
somewhere
about
his
heart
that
her
hair
was
like
the
reflection
of
a
sunset
in
rippling
waters
only
many
times
more
beautiful
of
course
and
that
her
mouth
was
an
inconsiderable
trifle
a
scrap
of
sanguine
curves
and
that
her
eyes
were
purple
glimpses
of
infinity
the
end
