pretty
lively
stunts
yes
that
all
right
bob
but
we
ai
going
to
begin
by
getting
cold
feet
over
a
bunch
of
kids
out
for
a
holiday
where
they
going
do
know
presume
they
be
taking
a
trip
over
the
plains
or
heading
for
the
mountains
they
got
a
stock
car
up
ahead
jammed
full
of
stock
and
equipment
scarecrows
no
good
stock
some
of
the
slickest
ponies
you
ever
set
eyes
on
there
one
roan
there
that
i
would
mind
owning
maybe
we
can
make
a
trade
and
the
speaker
chuckled
softly
to
himself
a
snore
louder
than
those
that
had
preceded
it
caused
the
two
men
to
laugh
heartily
the
snore
had
come
from
stacy
brown
both
he
and
tad
butler
were
resting
from
their
long
journey
on
the
atlantic
and
pacific
train
further
to
the
rear
of
the
car
their
companions
ned
rector
and
walter
perkins
also
were
curled
up
in
a
double
seat
with
professor
zepplin
sitting
very
straight
as
if
sleep
were
furthest
from
his
thoughts
they
were
nearing
their
destination
now
and
within
the
hour
would
be
unloading
their
stock
and
equipment
at
bluewater
they
asleep
all
right
grinned
one
of
the
two
men
who
occupied
the
seat
just
ahead
of
stacy
and
tad
is
old
man
marquand
going
to
meet
us
at
the
station
oh
no
that
would
be
a
good
thing
might
attract
too
much
attention
told
him
not
to
we
get
a
couple
of
ponies
at
bluewater
and
ride
across
the
mountains
but
we
got
to
be
slick
the
old
man
is
no
fool
he
hang
on
to
the
location
of
the
treasure
till
the
last
old
cat
gone
to
sleep
for
good
any
idea
where
the
place
is
no
except
that
it
somewhere
south
of
the
zuni
range
a
solitary
eye
in
the
seat
behind
opened
cautiously
the
eye
belonged
to
stacy
brown
the
last
snore
had
awakened
him
and
he
had
lain
with
closed
eyes
listening
to
the
conversation
of
the
two
men
he
gave
tad
a
gentle
nudge
which
was
returned
with
a
soft
pressure
on
stacy
right
arm
as
a
warning
that
he
was
to
remain
quiet
do
you
know
what
the
treasure
consists
of
maybe
a
mine
but
as
near
as
i
could
draw
from
marquand
talk
it
is
jewels
and
spanish
money
which
one
of
the
old
franciscan
monks
had
buried
the
pueblos
knew
where
it
was
but
they
sealed
the
place
up
after
the
pueblo
revolution
in
and
it
been
corked
tight
ever
since
how
marquand
get
wise
to
it
from
an
old
pueblo
chief
whose
life
he
saved
a
few
months
ago
the
old
chief
died
a
little
while
afterwards
but
before
he
went
he
told
marquand
about
the
treasure
did
suppose
a
redskin
had
so
much
gratitude
under
his
tough
skin
does
the
old
man
know
where
the
place
is
no
not
exactly
that
where
we
come
in
grinned
the
speaker
we
are
going
to
help
him
find
it
and
then
oh
well
there
lots
of
ways
to
get
rid
of
him
you
mean
he
might
tumble
off
into
a
canyon
or
something
of
the
sort
in
the
night
time
here
the
place
the
train
was
rounding
a
bend
into
the
little
town
of
bluewater
sit
still
whispered
tad
i
want
to
get
a
look
at
those
fellows
so
i
know
them
next
time
i
see
them
the
pony
rider
boy
left
his
seat
and
hurrying
to
the
forward
end
of
the
car
helped
himself
to
a
drink
of
water
from
the
tank
then
slowly
retraced
his
steps
as
he
walked
down
the
car
he
took
in
the
two
men
in
one
swift
comprehensive
glance
then
swung
his
hands
to
his
companions
at
the
other
end
of
the
car
as
a
signal
that
they
were
arriving
at
their
destination
know
whispered
stacy
as
tad
began
pulling
his
baggage
from
the
rack
never
saw
either
before
better
get
your
stuff
together
this
train
is
fast
only
when
it
stops
it
drags
along
over
the
country
but
when
it
gets
into
a
station
it
always
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
laughed
tad
a
few
minutes
later
the
party
of
bronzed
young
men
sprang
from
the
car
to
the
station
platform
where
they
instantly
became
the
center
of
a
throng
of
curious
villagers
readers
of
the
preceding
volumes
of
this
series
are
already
too
well
acquainted
with
the
pony
rider
boys
to
need
a
formal
introduction
as
told
in
the
pony
rider
boys
in
the
rockies
the
lads
had
set
out
from
their
homes
in
missouri
for
a
summer
vacation
in
the
saddle
that
first
volume
detailed
how
the
lads
penetrated
the
fastnesses
of
the
rockies
hunted
big
game
and
how
they
finally
discovered
the
lost
claim
which
they
won
after
fighting
a
battle
with
the
mountaineers
thus
earning
for
themselves
quite
a
fortune
in
the
pony
rider
boys
in
texas
the
boys
were
again
seen
to
advantage
there
they
joined
in
a
cattle
drive
across
the
state
as
cowboys
they
played
an
exciting
part
in
the
rough
life
of
the
cowmen
meeting
with
many
stirring
adventures
it
will
be
remembered
how
in
this
story
tad
butler
saved
a
large
part
of
the
herd
besides
performing
numerous
heroic
deeds
including
the
saving
of
the
life
of
a
member
of
the
party
from
a
swollen
river
at
the
end
of
their
journey
they
solved
a
deep
mystery
a
mystery
that
had
perplexed
and
worried
the
cattle
men
besides
causing
them
heavy
financial
loss
in
the
pony
rider
boys
in
montana
the
scene
shifted
to
the
old
custer
trail
the
battle
ground
of
one
of
the
most
tragic
events
in
american
history
the
story
described
how
tad
butler
overheard
a
plot
to
stampede
and
kill
a
flock
of
many
thousand
sheep
how
after
experiencing
many
hardships
he
finally
carried
the
news
to
the
owner
of
the
herd
then
later
participated
in
the
battle
between
the
cowmen
and
sheep
herders
in
which
the
latter
emerged
victorious
it
will
be
recalled
too
how
the
pony
rider
boy
was
captured
by
the
blackfeet
indians
and
taken
to
their
mountain
retreat
where
with
a
young
companion
he
was
held
until
they
made
their
escape
with
the
assistance
of
an
indian
maiden
how
they
were
pursued
by
the
savages
the
bullets
from
whose
rifles
singing
over
the
heads
of
the
lads
as
they
headed
for
a
river
into
which
they
plunged
thus
effectually
throwing
off
the
savage
pursuers
and
finally
how
in
time
they
made
their
way
back
to
the
camp
of
the
pony
riders
having
solved
the
mystery
of
the
old
custer
trail
after
these
exciting
adventures
the
lads
concluded
to
cut
short
their
montana
trip
and
go
on
to
the
next
stage
of
their
journeyings
which
was
destined
to
be
even
more
stirring
than
any
that
had
preceded
it
how
tad
butler
and
stacy
brown
proved
themselves
to
be
real
heroes
was
told
in
the
pony
rider
boys
in
the
ozarks
for
a
long
time
an
organized
band
of
thieves
had
been
stealing
stock
in
the
ozark
range
baffling
all
efforts
to
apprehend
them
the
boys
had
been
warned
to
guard
their
own
stock
carefully
but
despite
this
their
ponies
were
stolen
from
camp
one
by
one
and
in
a
most
mysterious
manner
until
not
an
animal
was
left
then
one
by
one
the
pony
rider
boys
became
lost
until
only
tad
and
stacy
remained
they
were
facing
starvation
and
it
will
be
recalled
how
tad
butler
made
a
plucky
trip
to
the
nearest
mining
camp
for
assistance
there
the
boys
were
imprisoned
underground
by
a
mine
explosion
escaping
from
which
they
met
with
perils
every
bit
as
grave
and
from
which
they
were
eventually
rescued
by
stacy
himself
through
the
disaster
the
lads
solved
the
secret
of
the
ruby
mountain
thus
putting
an
end
for
good
to
the
wholesale
thieving
in
the
ozark
range
though
the
pony
rider
boys
had
suffered
many
hardships
in
their
journeyings
those
that
lay
before
them
were
destined
to
try
them
even
more
in
the
pony
rider
boys
in
the
alkali
they
faced
the
perils
of
the
baking
alkali
desert
it
will
be
recalled
how
they
fought
desperately
for
water
when
all
the
usual
sources
of
supply
were
found
to
have
run
dry
how
tad
and
stacy
brown
were
captured
by
a
desert
hermit
and
thrown
into
a
cave
how
after
their
escape
they
were
lost
in
the
desert
maze
and
how
after
many
hardships
they
finally
succeeded
in
making
their
way
to
camp
dragging
behind
them
a
wild
coyote
that
tad
had
roped
when
the
boys
were
beset
by
the
wild
beasts
in
the
dead
of
night
nothing
daunted
by
their
trying
experiences
the
pony
rider
boys
set
out
on
the
concluding
trip
of
the
season
a
journey
over
the
historic
plains
and
mountains
of
new
mexico
after
a
long
railroad
ride
they
had
finally
arrived
at
the
town
of
bluewater
from
which
they
were
to
begin
their
explorations
in
the
southwest
a
guide
was
to
meet
and
conduct
them
across
the
mountains
of
the
zuni
range
and
so
on
to
the
southern
borders
of
the
state
by
the
time
they
reached
the
platform
of
the
station
the
stock
car
had
been
uncoupled
and
was
being
shifted
to
a
side
track
where
they
might
unload
their
belongings
at
their
leisure
i
wonder
where
that
guide
is
said
tad
he
was
told
to
be
here
answered
the
professor
never
mind
we
can
unload
better
without
him
averred
ned
starting
off
at
a
brisk
trot
for
their
car
which
had
been
shunted
alongside
the
platform
at
the
rear
of
the
station
with
joyous
anticipation
of
the
new
scenes
and
experiences
that
lay
before
them
the
lads
set
briskly
to
work
and
within
an
hour
had
all
the
stock
and
equipment
removed
from
the
car
there
was
quite
an
imposing
collection
with
their
ponies
their
burros
tents
and
other
equipment
the
latter
lying
strewn
all
over
the
open
level
space
beyond
the
station
looks
as
if
a
circus
had
just
come
to
town
laughed
walter

burro
there
laughed
chunky
guess
he
never
saw
an
outfit
like
ours
before
the
lads
could
not
repress
a
laugh
as
they
glanced
at
the
figure
pointed
out
by
stacy
the
man
was
sitting
on
the
burro
his
feet
extended
on
the
ground
before
him
hands
thrust
deep
into
trousers
pockets
he
was
observing
the
work
of
the
boys
curiously
the
fellow
high
conical
head
was
crowned
by
a
peaked
mexican
hat
much
the
worse
for
wear
while
his
coarse
black
hair
was
combed
straight
down
over
a
pair
of
small
piercing
dark
eyes
the
complexion
or
such
of
it
as
was
visible
through
the
mask
of
wiry
hair
was
swarthy
his
form
thin
and
insignificant
stacy
brown
strode
over
to
him
somewhat
pompously
you
speak
english
questioned
the
boy
si

the
mexican
lips
curled
back
revealing
two
rows
of
gleaming
white
teeth

by
the
other

with
a
wave
of
his
hand
toward
the
mexican
what

sniffed
ned

walter

interrupted
the
professor
coming
up
señor

grinned
stacy
he
very
well
acquainted
with
the
gentleman
then

this
juan
that
juan
that
your
guide
stacy
informed
the
professor
you
are
you
the
guide
si
señor
the
professor
opened
his
eyes
in
amazement
the
burro
on
the
other
hand
stood
with
nose
to
the
ground
sound
asleep
oblivious
to
all
that
was
taking
place
about
him
why
did
you
make
yourself
known
why
have
you
helped
us
to
unload
demanded
the
professor
in
an
irritated
tone

professor
they
are
just
ornaments
he
and
the
burro
are
going
to
pose
for
our
amusement
the
boys
laughed
heartily
professor
zepplin
uttered
an
exclamation
of
impatience
sir
if
you
are
going
with
this
outfit
you
will
be
expected
to
do
your
share
of
the
labor
there
are
no
drones
in
our
hive
no
we
all
work
interposed
stacy
and
some
of
us
are
eaters
added
ned
juan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
showed
his
pearly
teeth
at
the
professor
command
however
juan
stepped
off
the
burro
without
in
the
least
disturbing
that
animal
dreams
and
lazily
began
collecting
the
baggage
as
directed
by
the
professor
after
the
equipment
had
been
sorted
into
piles
the
boys
did
it
up
into
neat
packs
which
they
skillfully
strapped
to
the
backs
of
the
burros
of
their
pack
train
juan
lost
in
contemplation
of
their
labors
forgot
his
own
duties
until
reminded
of
them
by
stacy
who
gave
the
guide
a
violent
poke
in
the
ribs
with
his
thumb
juan
started
then
with
a
sheepish
grin
became
busy
again
it
was
no
small
task
to
get
their
belongings
in
packs
preparatory
to
the
journey
but
late
in
the
afternoon
the
boys
had
completed
their
task
they
had
had
nothing
to
eat
since
early
morning
but
they
were
too
anxious
to
be
on
their
way
to
wait
for
dinner
in
town
after
making
some
necessary
purchases
in
the
village
the
procession
finally
started
away
across
the
plain
you
never
get
anywhere
with
that
sleepy
burro
juan
decided
the
professor
with
a
shake
of
the
head
him
go
fast
grinned
the
mexican
so
can
a
crab
on
dry
land
jeered
ned
just
then
the
guide
utter
a
series
of
shrill
whereupon
the
lads
were
treated
to
an
exhibition
such
as
they
never
had
seen
before
the
sleepy
burro
projected
his
head
straight
out
before
him
while
his
tail
raised
to
a
level
with
his
back
stuck
straight
out
behind
him
the
burro
seemingly
imbued
with
sudden
life
was
off
at
a
pace
faster
than
a
man
could
run
it
was
most
astonishing
the
boys
gazed
in
amazement
then
burst
out
in
a
chorus
of
approving
yells
but
it
was
the
rider
even
more
than
the
burro
that
excited
their
mirth
his
long
legs
were
working
like
those
of
a
jumping
jack
and
though
astride
of
the
burro
juan
was
walking
at
a
lively
pace
it
reminded
one
of
the
way
men
propelled
the
velocipedes
years
before
a
cloud
of
dust
rose
behind
the
odd
outfit
as
the
party
drew
out
on
the
plains
their
ponies
were
started
at
a
gallop
which
was
necessary
to
enable
them
to
keep
up
with
the
pace
that
juan
had
set
here
here
shouted
the
professor
juan
never
looked
back
we
leaving
the
pack
train
slow
down
laughingly
the
lads
pulled
their
ponies
down
to
a
walk
then
halted
entirely
to
enable
the
burros
to
catch
up
with
them
by
this
time
the
pack
animals
had
become
so
familiar
with
their
work
that
little
attention
was
necessary
on
the
part
of
the
boys
now
and
then
one
more
sleepy
than
the
rest
would
go
to
sleep
and
pause
to
doze
a
few
minutes
on
the
trail
this
always
necessitated
all
hands
stopping
to
wait
until
the
sleeper
could
be
rounded
up
and
driven
up
to
the
bunch
juan
had
disappeared
they
were
discussing
the
advisability
of
sending
one
of
the
boys
out
after
him
when
he
was
seen
returning
but
at
what
a
different
gait
his
burro
was
dragging
itself
along
with
nose
to
the
ground
while
juan
himself
was
slouching
on
its
back
half
asleep
you
must
have
a
motor
inside
that
beast
grinned
tad
him
go
some
señor
him
do
answered
stacy
his
solemn
eyes
taking
in
the
sleepy
burro
wonderingly
better
not
waste
your
energy
performing
advised
the
professor
we
shall
need
what
little
you
have
we
will
make
camp
here
as
i
see
there
is
a
spring
near
by
help
the
boys
unpack
the
burros
si
señor
answered
the
guide
standing
erect
and
permitting
his
burro
to
walk
from
under
him
with
shouts
and
songs
the
lads
in
great
good
humor
went
to
work
at
once
pitching
their
camp
for
the
first
time
on
the
plains
of
new
mexico
there
was
much
to
be
done
and
twilight
was
upon
them
before
they
had
advanced
far
enough
to
begin
cooking
their
evening
meal
chapter
ii
in
the
zuni
foothills
a
sudden
wail
from
the
guide
attracted
the
attention
of
the
party
to
him
at
once
now
what
the
matter
demanded
tad
hurrying
to
him
the
guide
had
thrown
himself
prone
upon
the
ground
and
was
groaning
as
if
in
great
agony
offering
no
reply
to
the
question
are
you
sick

si
señor
moaned
juan
where
estomago

your
stomach
he
got
a
pain
under
his
apron
diagnosed
stacy
solemnly
been
working
too
hard
suggested
ned
in
the
meantime
the
guide
was
rolling
and
twisting
on
the
ground
glancing
appealingly
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
professor
had
you
better
fetch
your
medicine
case
and
dose
him
up
asked
tad
yes
i
attend
to
him
give
him
a
good
dose
while
you
are
about
it
urged
ned
something
that
will
cure
his
laziness
at
the
same
time
the
professor
brought
his
case
then
remembering
something
else
in
his
kit
that
he
wanted
he
laid
the
case
down
and
hurried
back
to
his
tent
however
stacy
opened
the
case
selecting
a
bottle
apparently
at
random
drew
the
cork
and
held
the
bottle
under
juan
nose
smell
of
this
my
son
it

on
the
run
be
careful
chunky
what
are
you
doing
there
warned
tad
you
should
fool
with
the
medicines
you
his
further
remarks
were
cut
short
by
a
sudden
yell
of
terror
and
pain
from
juan
the
guide
leaped
to
his
feet
choking
gasping
while
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
as
he
danced
about
as
if
suddenly
bereft
of
his
senses
now
you
gone
and
done
it
growled
ned
he
never
moved
so
fast
in
his
life
i
wager
juan
was
running
in
a
circle
now
shrieking
and
moaning
professor
zepplin
approached
them
in
a
series
of
leaps
he
could
not
imagine
what
new
disaster
had
overtaken
the
lazy
mexican
here
here
here
what
the
trouble
now
he
demanded
sternly
stop
that
howling
chunky
been
prescribing
for
your
patient
in
your
absence
ned
informed
him
the
professor
grabbed
the
wild
guide
by
the
collar
giving
him
a
vigorous
shake
when
he
released
his
grip
juan
sank
to
the
ground
in
a
heap
moaning
weakly
what
that
you
say
stacy
prescribed
i
i
let
him
smell
of
the
bottle
explained
stacy
guiltily
what
bottle
stacy
slowly
picked
up
the
offending
bottle
and
handed
it
to
the
professor
ammonia
boy
you
might
have
put
his
eyes
out
never
let
this
occur
again
remember
you
are
not
to
touch
the
medicines
under
any
circumstances
whatever
yes
sir
agreed
chunky
meekly
while
ned
rector
strolled
away
shaking
with
laughter
drink
begged
the
patient
fetch
him
some
water
directed
professor
zepplin
no
no
no
señor
protested
juan
gesticulating
protestingly
what
do
you
want
guess
he
wants
something
stronger
than
water
suggested
ned
si
si
si
agreed
the
guide
showing
his
white
teeth
in
an
approving
grin
you
wo
get
anything
stronger
than
that
in
this
outfit
unless
you
cook
yourself
some
coffee
muttered
tad
that
what
the
matter
with
him
decided
chunky
who
had
been
observing
the
sick
man
keenly
guess
we
drew
a
prize
when
we
got
juan
announced
walter
give
him
some
medicine
anyway
urged
ned
he
is
sick
let
him
take
the
dose
let
him
have
the
worst
you
got
in
your
case
professor
added
tad
with
a
laugh
a
grim
smile
played
about
the
corners
of
professor
zepplin
mouth
as
he
ran
his
fingers
over
the
bottles
in
his
medicine
case
finally
selecting
one
that
seemed
to
fit
the
particular
ailment
of
his
patient
he
directed
chunky
to
fetch
a
spoon
by
this
time
juan
was
protesting
volubly
that
he
was
all
better
and
did
not
need
the
medicine
the
professor
gave
no
heed
to
the
protestations
open
your
mouth
he
commanded
juan
shut
his
teeth
tightly
together
open
your
mouth
commanded
the
professor
sternly
we
want
no
sick
men
about
this
camp
it
will
fix
you
in
a
minute
but
the
guide
steadfastly
refused
to
separate
the
white
teeth
boys
open
his
mouth
while
i
pour
the
medicine
down
him
gritted
the
professor
they
required
no
urging
to
do
the
professor
bidding
tad
and
ned
ranged
themselves
on
either
side
of
the
patient
while
chunky
sat
on
the
guide
feet
almost
before
he
was
aware
of
their
purpose
the
boys
had
pried
his
jaws
open
and
into
the
opening
thus
made
professor
zepplin
dropped
the
concoction
he
had
mixed
the
effect
was
electrical
juan
leaped
to
his
feet
as
if
elevated
by
springs
uttering
a
yell
that
might
have
been
heard
a
mile
or
more
on
the
open
plain
but
juan
did
not
run
in
a
circle
this
time
acting
upon
the
mathematical
theory
that
a
straight
line
is
the
shortest
distance
between
two
points
the
guide
made
a
break
for
the
spring
howling
like
a
madman
the
pony
rider
boys
looked
on
in
amazement
juan
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
spring
dipping
up
the
water
in
his
hands
what
did
you
give
him
professor
grinned
tad
hot
drops
answered
the
man
of
science
tersely
not
that
stuff
you
fed
me
when
i
ate
too
much
honey
in
the
rockies
questioned
stacy
the
same
wow
i
had
ten
drops
and
it
felt
like
a
pailful
when
it
got
inside
of
me
how
much
did
you
give
juan
questioned
walter
twenty
drops
answered
professor
zepplin
without
the
suspicion
of
a
smile
on
his
face
this
time
the
pony
rider
boys
added
their
yells
to
those
of
the
guide
only
with
a
difference
the
more
juan
drank
of
the
spring
water
the
more
did
the
hot
drops
burn
all
at
once
he
sprang
up
and
started
for
the
plain
catch
him
commanded
the
professor
with
a
shout
the
lads
started
in
pursuit
they
overhauled
the
guide
some
twenty
rods
from
camp
he
having
proved
himself
fleet
of
foot
then
again
the
fire
within
him
perhaps
helped
to
increase
his
natural
speed
i
burn
i
burn
he
wailed
as
the
boys
grabbed
and
laughingly
hustled
him
back
to
camp
you
burn
worse
than
that
if
you
ever
ask
for
liquor
in
this
outfit
retorted
ned
we
do
use
the
stuff
nor
do
we
allow
anyone
around
us
who
does
how
do
you
feel
now
grinned
the
professor
as
they
came
up
to
him
with
their
prisoner
he
got
a
whole
in
his
little
estomago
announced
chunky
solemnly
which
sally
elicited
a
loud
laugh
from
the
boys
give
him
some
olive
oil
directed
the
professor
i
think
the
lesson
has
been
sufficiently
burned
into
him
but
considerable
persuasion
was
necessary
to
induce
juan
to
take
a
spoonful
of
the
professor
medicine
he
had
already
had
one
sample
of
it
and
he
did
not
want
another
yet
after
some
urging
he
tasted
of
the
oil
at
first
gingerly
then
he
took
it
down
at
a
gulp
ah
he
breathed
is
it
good
grinned
tad
si
much
burn
much
burn
he
explained
rubbing
his
stomach
think
you
want
some
liquor
still
juan
or
would
you
prefer
another
dose
of
my
magic
drops
no
no
no
señor
cried
juan
hastily
moving
away
from
professor
zepplin
very
well
any
time
when
you
feel
a
longing
for
strong
drink
just
help
yourself
to
the
hot
drops
said
the
professor
striding
away
to
his
tent
medicine
case
in
hand
the
guide
a
much
chastened
man
set
about
assisting
in
getting
the
evening
meal
but
the
hot
drops
still
remained
with
him
making
their
presence
known
by
occasional
hot
twinges
supper
that
night
was
an
enjoyable
affair
though
it
was
observed
that
the
guide
did
not
eat
heartily
do
you
think
he
really
had
a
pain
asked
walter
confidentially
leaning
toward
ned
pain
no
he
wanted
something
else
and
he
got
it
added
stacy
nodding
solemnly
a
chorus
of
he
dids
ran
around
the
table
stopping
only
when
they
reached
juan
himself
chapter
iii
indians
juan
did
you
see
two
men
get
off
the
train
at
bluewater
yesterday
when
we
did
one
of
them
had
a
big
broad
sombrero
like
mine
asked
tad
riding
up
beside
the
guide
next
day
while
they
were
crossing
the
range
si
know
them
si
he
replied
holding
up
one
finger
you
mean
you
know
one
of
them
the
guide
nodded
who
is
he
señor
lasar
lasar
what
his
other
name
juan
not
know
did
they
stop
in
the
village
no
señors
get
ponies
ride
over
mountain
and
the
guide
pointed
lazily
to
the
where
did
they
go
do
you
know
juan
shrugged
his
shoulders
indicating
that
he
did
not
what
is
lasar
business
again
the
guide
answered
with
a
shrug
he
seemed
disinclined
to
discuss
the
man
in
whom
tad
butler
was
so
much
interested
up
to
that
time
the
lad
had
been
too
fully
occupied
with
other
matters
to
think
of
the
conversation
he
and
stacy
had
overheard
on
the
atlantic
and
pacific
train
now
it
came
back
to
him
with
full
force
know
anybody
by
the
name
of
marquand
in
this
country
he
asked
taking
another
tack
juan
said
he
did
not
and
then
tad
gave
up
his
questioning
i
was
asking
juan
about
the
two
men
who
sat
ahead
of
us
in
the
train
yesterday
he
explained
to
chunky
as
the
fat
boy
joined
them
wha
he
say
one
is
named
lasar
but
he
did
not
know
the
other
one
i
ca
help
believing
that
those
fellows
were
plotting
to
do
some
one
a
great
injury
so
do
i
agreed
chunky
i
guess
we
had
better
not
say
anything
about
it
to
the
others
but
we
try
to
find
out
who
this
man
lasar
is
and
who
marquand
is
then
we
decide
what
to
do
next
their
further
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
voice
of
the
professor
announcing
that
they
would
halt
for
their
noonday
meal
all
other
thoughts
left
the
mind
of
stacy
brown
when
the
question
of
food
was
raised
he
quickly
slipped
from
his
pony
running
back
to
hurry
the
burros
along
so
as
to
hasten
the
meal
for
which
he
was
yearning
only
one
burro
was
unpacked
as
it
was
the
intention
of
the
outfit
to
push
on
soon
after
finishing
their
lunch
while
the
guide
under
ned
direction
was
making
it
ready
tad
and
chunky
strolled
off
to
climb
a
high
rock
that
they
had
seen
in
the
vicinity
and
which
they
thought
might
give
them
a
good
view
of
the
plains
to
the
southwest
on
the
other
side
of
the
range
they
had
promised
to
be
back
in
half
an
hour
but
circumstances
arose
that
caused
them
to
delay
their
return
considerably
after
threshing
through
the
bushes
over
sharp
rocks
and
through
miniature
canyons
they
gained
at
last
the
object
of
their
quest
the
distance
had
been
further
than
they
had
imagined
we
have
to
make
a
short
trip
of
it
up
to
the
top
and
back
said
tad
it
has
taken
us
almost
all
our
time
to
get
here
but
we
have
a
look
anyway
they
soon
gained
the
top
of
the
rock
which
stood
some
twenty
feet
higher
than
the
crest
of
the
mountain
on
which
it
rested
is
this
great
exclaimed
tad
might
think
we
were
in
the
rockies
or
the
ozarks
i
hope
we
do
have
as
much
trouble
here
as
we
did
in
that
range
our
guide
is
not
much
better
than
the
shawnee
we
had
for
a
time
on
that
trip
i
ca
see
the
foothills
but
the
plain
on
beyond
is
pretty
clear
hope
we
do
have
to
chase
all
over
the
desert
for
water
i
tad
grasped
his
companion
by
the
sleeve
and
jerked
him
violently
to
the
rock
what
up
what
the
matter
with
you
protested
stacy
keep
still
some
one
coming
the
lad
keen
ears
had
caught
a
sound
which
stacy
had
entirely
failed
to
hear
it
was
the
sound
of
horses
making
their
way
through
the
bushes
there
were
several
in
the
party
tad
could
tell
by
the
sounds
and
having
in
mind
the
man
lasar
he
thought
he
might
perhaps
learn
something
of
advantage
by
remaining
quietly
on
the
top
of
the
rock
all
this
he
explained
in
a
few
brief
words
to
his
companion
then
both
boys
crouched
low
peering
over
the
cliff
having
first
removed
their
sombreros
what
they
saw
a
few
moments
later
surprised
them
very
much
indeed
the
horsemen
in
single
file
suddenly
appeared
out
of
a
draw
to
the
east
and
headed
for
the
rock
where
the
lads
were
in
hiding
look
look
exclaimed
tad
in
a
low
suppressed
voice
breathed
chunky
they
seemed
to
rise
right
up
out
of
the
ground
as
one
by
one
they
emerged
from
the
draw
to
the
more
level
rocks
that
lay
about
the
hiding
place
of
the
pony
rider
boys
i
wonder
who
they
are
questioned
tad
they
look
savage
i
wonder
if
they
hurt
us
tad
i
do
know
i
do
know
though
that
i
would
trust
those
ugly
faces
one
second
i
thought
the
blackfeet
were
savage
but
they
not
to
be
compared
with
these
redskins
a
full
dozen
of
them
had
by
this
time
come
into
view
they
sat
huddled
on
their
ponies
their
painted
faces
just
appearing
above
the
gayly
colored
blankets
in
which
they
were
enveloped
they
must
be
cold
muttered
chunky
should
think
they
need
bed
clothes
around
them
this
time
of
the
year
not
so
loud
chunky
warned
tad
know
what
they
are
tad
i
would
say
positively
but
somehow
they
look
to
me
like
apaches
tad
surmise
was
correct
the
twelve
warriors
were
members
of
the
savage
band
that
had
in
past
years
caused
the
government
so
much
trouble
and
bloodshed
they
off
their
reservation
if
they
are
apaches
whispered
the
lad
what
does
that
indicate
tad
i
do
know
they
may
be
on
the
warpath
then
again
they
may
be
down
here
after
game
i
not
sure
even
if
there
is
any
game
here
we
lie
still
until
they
get
by
us
that
the
best
plan
do
you
think
so
yes
lie
perfectly
still
chunky
the
little
bushes
in
front
of
us
will
screen
us
providing
we
do
move
about
indians
have
quick
eyes
though
they
do
look
as
if
they
were
half
asleep
they
getting
off
their
horses
tad
what
does
that
mean
i
do
know
tad
peered
through
the
bushes
noting
every
move
that
the
redskins
made
at
first
he
thought
they
had
discovered
him
and
were
about
to
surround
the
rock
and
take
him
prisoner
but
he
soon
saw
that
such
was
not
their
intention
tethering
their
ponies
the
indians
cast
their
blankets
on
the
ground
after
having
first
picked
out
a
suitable
place
they
making
camp
whispered
tad
one
after
another
of
the
savages
took
out
his
pipe
and
soon
the
odor
from
burning
tobacco
was
wafted
to
the
nostrils
of
the
hidden
pony
rider
boys
guess
they
going
to
get
some
dinner
decided
stacy
observing
that
the
strangers
were
gathering
brush
this
was
the
case
the
ponies
had
been
staked
where
they
could
browse
on
the
green
leaves
and
now
their
masters
were
about
to
satisfy
their
own
appetites
tad
groaned
what
is
it
questioned
stacy
apprehensively
they
will
be
here
half
of
the
day
at
least
i
know
a
little
about
indians
having
been
captured
by
them
once
the
difference
is
that
my
indians
were
in
a
hurry
to
get
somewhere
these
fellows
seem
to
have
all
the
time
in
the
world
they
waiting
killing
time
for
some
reason
you
see
after
they
finish
their
dinner
that
they
will
smoke
some
more
then
lie
down
for
a
catnap
and
and
what
we
be
doing
we
be
hiding
on
the
top
of
this
rock
chunky
wish
i
had
my
rifle
lucky
for
both
of
us
that
you
have
the
lads
had
been
talking
in
whispers
but
the
words
fairly
froze
in
their
mouths
when
upon
glancing
down
they
saw
the
eyes
of
a
savage
fixed
upon
them
on
your
life
do
move
a
muscle
chunky
whispered
tad
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
his
wits
tad
was
not
sure
that
the
indian
saw
them
yet
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
savage
eyes
were
burning
into
their
very
own
soon
however
the
indian
dropped
his
glances
to
his
pipe
bowl
and
the
boys
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
do
move
yet
chunky
directed
tad
it
was
a
wise
command
for
almost
instantly
the
indian
glanced
in
their
direction
again
and
as
if
satisfied
emptied
his
pipe
and
stretched
out
on
his
blanket
the
two
lads
breathed
sighs
of
relief
did
he
see
us
do
you
think
tad
no
at
first
he
thought
he
saw
something
up
here
but
he
changed
his
mind
after
a
little
as
you
observed
by
this
time
the
redskins
were
cooking
their
midday
meal
and
the
odor
nearly
drove
stacy
frantic
it
made
him
realize
how
hungry
he
was
he
pulled
a
leaf
from
a
bush
and
began
chewing
it
in
hopes
of
wearing
off
the
keen
edge
of
his
appetite
how
long
we
got
to
stay
here
he
demanded
i
a
good
notion
to
get
up
and
walk
back
to
camp
they
do
dare
hurt
us
lie
still
commanded
his
companion
sternly
i
have
a
plan
that
we
may
be
able
to
put
into
operation
we
ca
do
it
now
though
the
lads
waited
tad
almost
with
the
patience
of
an
indian
chunky
ill
at
ease
and
restless
ca
you
lie
still
what
ails
you
my
stomach
fighting
my
appetite
hear
growl
at
each
other
i
do
care
i
as
soon
be
scalped
as
to
starve
to
death
the
braves
had
by
now
filled
their
stomachs
gulping
their
food
down
without
the
formality
of
chewing
it
at
all
stacy
amazement
was
partly
mixed
with
admiration
as
he
observed
the
food
disappear
with
such
rapidity
now
the
braves
had
begun
puffing
at
their
pipes
after
a
time
one
by
one
laid
down
his
smoking
bowl
and
stretched
himself
out
for
a
nap
just
as
tad
had
said
they
would
the
savages
were
spread
out
so
that
they
had
a
very
good
view
of
three
sides
of
the
rock
on
which
the
two
lads
were
perched
but
the
fourth
side
was
hidden
from
them
tad
decided
that
as
the
indians
showed
no
intention
of
moving
they
were
going
to
remain
where
they
were
until
night
i
want
you
to
follow
me
chunky
butler
said
determined
to
try
his
plan
you
will
have
to
move
absolutely
without
a
sound
look
before
you
put
down
foot
or
hand
be
sure
where
you
place
them
we
wait
a
few
minutes
until
they
sound
asleep
what
you
going
to
do
sneak
try
to
get
back
to
camp
the
others
will
be
coming
along
looking
for
us
pretty
soon
if
we
do
get
away
the
indians
might
resent
being
disturbed
and
perhaps
make
trouble
tell
me
when
you
ready
then
some
minutes
had
elapsed
and
the
lads
could
plainly
hear
the
snores
of
their
besiegers
now
whispered
tad
at
the
same
time
he
began
crawling
toward
the
edge
of
the
rock
at
their
rear
stacy
was
close
upon
his
heels
the
side
which
the
boys
were
to
descend
was
much
more
precipitous
than
the
one
they
had
come
up
by
but
offered
no
very
great
difficulties
for
two
nimble
boys
proceeding
with
infinite
caution
they
gained
the
ground
without
a
mishap
we
walk
straight
on
in
this
direction
until
we
get
out
of
sight
then
we
can
turn
to
the
left
and
hurry
to
the
camp
stacy
nodded
as
he
did
so
his
eyes
were
off
the
ground
for
a
few
seconds
those
few
seconds
proved
his
undoing
the
lad
stepped
on
a
stone
that
gave
way
under
him
turning
his
ankle
almost
upon
its
side
ouch
yelled
chunky
now
you
done
it
snapped
tad
we
have
the
whole
pack
of
them
down
on
us
can
you
walk
i
i
do
know
i
try
take
hold
of
my
hand
you
got
to
run
the
redskins
were
on
their
feet
in
an
instant
a
few
bounds
carried
them
around
the
rock
whence
the
exclamation
had
come
by
this
time
tad
had
dragged
his
companion
into
the
bushes
but
not
quickly
enough
to
elude
the
keen
eyes
of
the
savages
the
indians
uttered
a
short
sharp
cry
then
aimed
their
rifles
at
the
figures
of
the
two
fleeing
pony
rider
boys
tad
saw
the
movement
he
threw
himself
prone
upon
the
ground
jerking
chunky
down
beside
him
they
were
screened
from
the
eyes
of
the
enemy
for
the
moment
crawl
crawl
commanded
tad
on
hands
and
feet
the
boys
began
running
rapidly
over
the
ground
on
down
into
a
narrow
gulch
if
they
could
gain
the
opposite
side
they
would
be
safe
as
it
was
unlikely
that
the
indians
would
follow
them
there
to
do
so
the
boys
were
obliged
to
cross
an
open
space
they
had
just
reached
it
when
their
pursuers
appeared
behind
them
once
more
the
indians
raised
their
rifles
their
fingers
exerting
a
gentle
pressure
on
the
triggers
chapter
iv
on
the
trail
of
juan
look
out
they
going
to
shoot
cried
tad
the
lads
quickly
rolled
in
opposite
directions
tad
the
call
was
in
the
stentorian
voice
of
professor
zepplin
to
which
ned
rector
added
a
shout
of
his
own
fearing
that
some
ill
had
befallen
tad
and
stacy
the
others
had
started
out
after
them
following
them
came
walter
and
the
lazy
mexican
we
down
here
look
out
for
the
indians
warned
tad
in
a
loud
voice
you
crazy
jeered
ned
come
out
of
that
what
ails
you
fellows
the
dinner
stone
cold
and
professor
zepplin
is
all
in
the
stew
tad
scrambled
to
his
feet
with
a
quick
glance
at
the
top
of
the
ridge
where
but
a
moment
before
half
a
dozen
rifles
had
been
leveled
at
chunky
and
himself
not
an
indian
was
in
sight
tad
was
amazed
he
could
not
understand
it
grabbing
stacy
by
an
arm
he
hurried
him
up
the
other
side
of
the
gulch
where
they
quickly
joined
their
companions
what
does
this
mean
demanded
the
professor
hurry
we
must
get
out
of
this
it
indians
they
they
wanted
to
scalp
us
interjected
stacy
but
you
runned
away
eh
brave
man
chuckled
ned
indians
there
are
no
indians
here
i
tell
you
about
it
when
we
get
to
camp
they
were
just
about
to
shoot
at
us
when
you
appeared
up
here
bad
injun
vouchsafed
juan
were
those
apaches
questioned
tad
the
guide
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
was
sure
they
were
though
i
do
not
think
i
ever
saw
an
apache
before
they
do
live
about
here
do
they
juan
off
reservation
him
go
dance
firewater
ugh
making
a
motion
as
if
scalping
himself
i
hungry
called
stacy
yes
so
am
i
added
tad
but
i
think
we
had
better
not
wait
to
eat
we
can
take
a
bite
in
the
saddle
while
we
are
moving
stacy
protested
loudly
at
this
but
tad
judgment
prevailed
with
the
professor
after
the
boys
had
related
their
experience
in
detail
all
hands
began
at
once
to
pack
up
the
few
belongings
that
had
been
taken
from
the
burro
and
once
more
they
started
on
their
way
moving
somewhat
more
rapidly
than
had
been
the
case
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
i
do
suppose
there
will
be
much
use
in
our
hurrying
professor
said
the
lad
after
they
had
been
going
a
short
time
i
know
enough
about
indians
to
be
sure
those
fellows
will
follow
us
until
they
satisfy
themselves
who
and
what
we
are
they
are
up
to
some
mischief
and
they
thought
we
were
spying
on
them
otherwise
i
do
not
believe
they
would
have
tried
to
shoot
us
do
know
as
you
could
blame
them
much
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
you
master
tad
it
will
be
good
policy
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
them
if
we
discover
any
of
them
just
go
right
along
about
our
business
as
if
we
did
see
them
at
all
and
you
not
likely
to
grinned
tad
where
did
you
say
they
were
going
juan
go
dance
he
means
they
bound
for
a
somewhere
that
explains
it
nodded
the
lad
the
rest
of
the
day
passed
without
incident
not
a
sign
of
the
indians
did
the
boys
see
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
roving
redskins
were
as
anxious
to
keep
out
of
the
sight
of
the
pony
riders
as
the
boys
were
to
have
them
do
so
the
party
enjoyed
the
trip
over
the
mountains
immensely
and
when
a
few
days
later
they
made
camp
in
the
foothills
on
the
southern
side
of
the
zuni
range
the
boys
declared
that
they
had
never
had
a
better
time
professor
zepplin
decided
that
they
would
remain
in
that
camp
for
a
couple
of
days
as
he
desired
to
make
some
scientific
investigations
and
collect
geological
specimens
this
suited
the
rest
of
the
party
who
were
free
to
make
as
many
side
trips
as
they
wished
into
mountain
fastnesses
or
over
the
plains
to
the
south
of
them
early
in
the
day
the
guide
asked
permission
to
go
away
for
an
hour
or
so
they
noticed
that
he
had
been
uneasy
apparently
anxious
to
get
away
for
some
reason
unknown
to
them
he
got
something
up
his
sleeve
decided
tad
eyeing
juan
narrowly
you
may
go
but
we
shall
expect
you
back
in
time
for
the
noon
meal
the
professor
told
him
give
me
money
requested
the
guide
certainly
let
me
see
you
have
worked
a
week
i
gave
you
five
dollars
when
we
started
out
you
were
to
have
ten
dollars
a
week
while
you
were
with
us
that
leaves
five
dollars
due
you
announced
the
professor
me
work
week
me
want
ten
dollars
but
my
man
i
already
paid
you
five
dollars
which
pays
you
for
half
of
the
week
here
is
the
five
dollars
for
the
other
half
all
i
owe
you
do
you
understand
si
señor
but
juan
work
one
week
protested
the
guide
let
me
show
him
interrupted
tad
he
drew
ten
marks
in
the
sand
with
a
stick
separating
them
into
two
groups
of
five
here
are
ten
marks
juan
we
call
them
ten
dollars
understand
si
well
here
are
the
first
five
marks
in
the
dirt
that
the
professor
paid
you
how
many
does
that
leave
five
gleamed
the
white
teeth
right
go
to
the
head
of
the
class
interrupted
stacy
chunky
you
keep
out
of
this
you
mix
him
up
guess
somebody
mixed
up
already
retorted
the
fat
boy
five
is
right
continued
tad
five
dollars
is
what
we
owe
you
is
that
clear
now
si
señor
but
i
work
one
week
juan
earn
ten
dollar
i
tell
you
what
to
do
interjected
ned
start
all
over
again
you
begin
work
juan
and
we
pay
you
ten
dollars
for
every
week
from
now
on
you
have
worked
for
us
before
you
know
the
lads
laughed
heartily
but
juan
merely
showed
his
teeth
protesting
that
he
had
earned
ten
dollars
here
said
tad
thrusting
a
five
dollar
bill
at
him
you
take
this
it
all
we
owe
you
if
you
see
any
of
your
friends
you
ask
them
how
much
we
owe
you
they
tell
you
the
professor
is
right
juan
took
the
money
greedily
still
protesting
that
they
owed
him
ten
dollars
because
he
had
worked
a
week
mounting
his
burro
he
rode
away
at
once
falling
into
the
marvelous
speed
that
he
had
shown
them
on
the
first
day
out
the
lads
shouted
with
laughter
as
they
saw
burro
and
rider
disappear
among
the
foothills
both
running
for
all
they
were
worth
juan
uttering
his
shrill
as
he
pedaled
the
ground
that
was
the
last
they
saw
of
the
mexican
guide
that
day
the
rest
of
the
day
was
employed
in
games
trick
riding
rope
throwing
and
the
like
stacy
found
some
horned
frogs
which
were
of
considerable
interest
to
the
boys
chunky
made
the
discovery
that
the
frogs
liked
to
have
their
backs
scratched
with
a
stick
and
the
frogs
of
the
foothills
probably
never
spent
such
a
happy
day
in
all
their
lives
as
chunky
and
his
stick
provided
for
them
that
afternoon
late
in
the
day
it
dawned
upon
the
boys
that
juan
was
still
absent
they
consulted
with
the
professor
about
this
upon
his
return
from
a
collecting
trip
along
the
foot
of
the
mountains
but
the
professor
was
sure
juan
would
be
in
in
time
for
supper
such
was
not
the
case
however
after
the
meal
had
been
finished
tad
announced
his
intention
of
riding
off
in
the
direction
juan
had
gone
to
see
if
the
guide
could
not
be
found
i
go
with
you
announced
stacy
all
right
come
along
said
tad
tightening
his
saddle
girths
we
have
a
fine
gallop
be
careful
that
you
do
not
get
lost
boys
warned
the
professor
ca
get
lost
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
follow
the
foothills
we
shall
probably
find
juan
and
his
burro
sound
asleep
on
an
somewhere
he
positively
the
laziest
human
being
i
ever
set
eyes
on
better
take
along
five
dollars
to
bait
him
with
suggested
ned
i
got
my
stick
said
stacy
i
tickle
the
back
of
the
burro
and
its
rider
just
as
i
did
the
frogs
you
try
that
on
the
burro
and
he
kick
you
into
the
middle
of
next
week
warned
walter
yes
laughed
tad
did
you
see
him
kick
when
juan
tossed
a
tomato
can
against
his
heels
this
morning
kicked
the
can
clear
over
a
tree
and
out
of
sight
he
make
a
good
batter
for
the
chillicothe
baseball
team
suggested
chunky
he
be
the
only
real
batter
in
the
nine
they
could
turn
him
loose
on
the
umpire
when
they
did
need
him
on
the
diamond
it
be
funny
to
see
some
umpires
kicked
over
the
high
board
fence
come
along
if
you
are
going
with
me
stacy
swung
into
his
saddle
and
galloping
off
caught
up
with
tad
who
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
camp
before
dark
keep
your
eyes
to
the
right
chunky
and
i
look
on
the
left
if
you
see
anything
that
looks
like
a
lazy
mexican
and
a
lazy
burro
just
call
out
i
run
over
them
that
what
i
do
declared
the
fat
boy
hello
there
a
fellow
on
horseback
i
see
him
the
lads
changed
their
course
a
little
so
as
to
head
off
the
solitary
horseman
who
was
loping
along
in
something
of
a
hurry
howdy
greeted
the
lad
evening
stranger
where
you
hail
from
and
where
to
we
in
camp
back
here
i
looking
for
our

over
yonder
gambling
with
some
renegade
apaches
apaches
exclaimed
the
lads
in
one
voice
those
must
be
the
same
fellows
we
saw
up
in
the
range
but
how
do
you
suppose
he
knew
they
were
over
there
he
those
greasers
know
everything
except
what
they
ought
to
know
especially
if
there
any
games
of
chance
going
on
will
you
please
tell
me
how
we
can
reach
the
place
we
want
to
make
a
very
early
start
in
the
morning
and
i
do
like
to
take
a
chance
of
his
not
getting
back
in
time
if
ye
bound
to
go
keep
right
along
the
edge
of
the
foothills
you
ca
miss
the
place
better
keep
away
if
you
do
want
to
be
getting
into
a
there
going
to
be
lively
doings
over
there
pretty
soon
warned
the
stranger
how
do
you
mean
i
seen
indians
before
guess
they
wo
hurt
us
if
they
let
juan
with
them
this
is
different
young
man
they
going
to
hold
a
fire
dance
a
fire
dance
yes
i
thought
they
were
allowed
to
do
that
any
more
they
ai
but
they
will
there
a
bunch
of
sabobas
from
over
the
line
they
the
original
fire
eaters
they
come
over
here
kind
of
secret
like
then
there
pueblos
and
bad
ones
from
every
tribe
within
a
hundred
miles
of
here
been
making
smoke
signals
from
the
mountains
for
more
a
week
past
i
saw
that
yesterday
and
thought
it
was
intended
as
a
signal
right
but
you
do
think
there
will
be
any
danger
in
just
going
after
our
guide
do
you
boy
they
be
letting
blood
before
morning
even
if
the
government
does
drop
down
on
the
picnic
and
clean
out
the
whole
bunch
of
them
there
is
sure
to
be
trouble
before
morning
thank
you
said
tad
touching
his
pony
going
on
questioned
the
horseman
yes
i
going
to
fetch
juan
replied
tad
touching
spurs
to
his
pony
and
galloping
away
followed
by
stacy
brown
the
horseman
sat
his
saddle
watching
the
receding
forms
of
the
two
pony
rider
boys
until
they
disappeared
behind
a
butte
in
the
foothills
well
if
those
kids
ai
got
the
sand
he
muttered
chapter
v
a
daring
act
if
you
do
want
to
go
with
me
you
may
go
back
chunky
perhaps
one
would
not
be
as
likely
to
get
into
trouble
as
two
you
can
find
your
way
ca
you
i
go
back
think
i
a
tenderfoot
huh
guess
i
ai
afraid
of
any
cheap
wild
west
indians
i
going
with
you
tad
very
well
but
see
to
it
that
you
keep
in
the
background
you
have
a
habit
of
getting
into
trouble
on
the
slightest
provocation
so
do
you
retorted
stacy
the
ponies
had
been
urged
to
their
best
pace
by
this
time
twilight
had
fallen
and
darkness
would
settle
over
them
in
a
very
short
time
now
though
a
new
moon
hovered
pale
and
weak
in
the
blue
sky
above
tad
knew
this
so
he
did
not
worry
about
the
return
trip
we
should
be
sighting
the
place
pretty
soon
he
muttered
i
see
a
light
announced
stacy
where
to
the
right
over
that
low
butte
there
yes
that
so
i
see
it
now
you
have
sharp
eyes
laughed
tad
i
can
see
when
there
anything
to
see
and
eat
when
there
food
to
be
had
added
tad
think
those
are
the
indians
that
wanted
to
shoot
us
tad
he
asked
with
a
trace
of
apprehension
in
his
voice
tad
glanced
at
his
companion
keenly
getting
cold
feet
chunky
no
roared
the
fat
boy
i
beg
your
pardon
grinned
tad
i
did
mean
to
insult
you
better
not
look
out
that
you
do
get
chilblains
on
your
own
feet
may
need
a
hot
mustard
bath
yourself
before
you
get
through
they
rounded
the
butte
a
full
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
of
them
flickered
a
large
fire
with
several
smaller
blazes
twinkling
here
and
there
about
it
shadowy
figures
were
observed
moving
back
and
forth
some
with
rapid
movements
others
in
slow
methodical
steps
there
must
be
a
lot
of
them
tad
looks
that
way
i
wonder
where
we
shall
find
the
guide
both
boys
fell
silent
for
a
time
and
as
they
drew
nearer
to
the
scene
pulled
their
ponies
down
to
a
walk
tad
concluded
to
make
a
detour
half
way
round
the
camp
in
order
to
get
a
clump
of
bushes
that
he
had
observed
between
them
and
the
redskins
from
that
point
of
vantage
he
would
be
able
to
get
a
closer
view
and
perhaps
locate
the
man
for
whom
he
was
looking
riding
in
they
were
soon
swallowed
up
in
the
shadows
hold
my
pony
a
moment
directed
tad
slipping
to
the
ground
where
are
you
going
nowhere
just
this
minute
i
going
to
look
around
the
lad
peered
through
the
bushes
until
uttering
a
low
exclamation
he
turned
to
his
companion
i
see
him
he
over
on
the
other
side
who
juan
yes
now
i
want
you
to
remain
right
here
do
move
away
i
tie
my
pony
so
he
wo
give
you
any
trouble
sit
perfectly
quiet
and
if
any
indians
come
along
do
bother
them
i
going
around
the
outside
so
i
do
have
to
pass
through
the
crowd
though
they
seem
too
busy
to
notice
anyone
tad
slipped
away
in
the
shadows
until
he
came
to
a
spot
opposite
where
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
lazy
mexican
he
discovered
juan
in
the
center
of
a
circle
of
dusky
indians
who
were
squatting
on
the
ground
some
of
the
braves
were
clothed
in
nondescript
garments
while
others
were
attired
in
gaudy
blankets
these
were
the
gamblers
at
that
moment
their
efforts
were
concentrated
on
winning
from
juan
the
wages
of
his
first
week
work
with
the
pony
rider
boys
a
blanket
had
been
spread
over
the
ground
and
on
this
they
were
wagering
small
amounts
on
the
throw
of
the
dice
a
flickering
near
by
dimly
lighting
up
the
blanket
and
making
the
reading
of
the
dice
a
difficult
matter
for
any
but
the
keenest
of
eyes
the
calls
of
the
players
added
to
the
weirdness
of
the
scene
tad
waited
long
enough
to
observe
that
the
guide
lost
nearly
every
time
the
red
men
raking
in
his
coins
with
painful
regularity
it
a
wonder
he
has
a
cent
left
but
they
not
playing
for
very
large
amounts
as
near
as
i
can
tell
each
time
the
mexican
lost
he
would
utter
a
shrill
si
si
then
lured
by
the
hope
that
dame
fortune
would
favor
him
reached
greedily
for
the
next
throw
it
time
for
me
to
do
something
muttered
tad
stepping
boldly
from
his
cover
he
walked
up
to
the
edge
of
the
circle
juan
he
called
sharply
si
answered
the
mexican
without
looking
up
juan
this
time
the
word
was
uttered
in
a
more
commanding
voice
you
come
with
me
the
guide
oblivious
to
all
beyond
the
terrible
fascination
of
the
game
he
was
playing
gave
no
heed
to
tad
butler
stern
command
three
times
did
tad
call
to
him
but
without
result
one
of
the
red
men
cast
an
angry
glance
in
the
tad
direction
and
then
returned
to
his
play
without
an
instant
hesitation
tad
sprang
over
into
the
center
of
the
circle
and
grasping
juan
by
an
ear
jerked
him
to
his
feet
red
hands
fell
to
belts
and
dark
faces
scowled
menacingly
at
the
intruder
you
come
with
me
juan
juan
sought
to
jerk
away
but
under
the
strong
pull
on
his
ear
he
did
not
find
it
advisable
to
force
himself
from
his
captor
grip
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
you
lucky
if
professor
zepplin
does
give
you
another
dose
of
hot
drops
for
this
i
suppose
these
indians
sat
down
to
rob
you
growled
tad
no
no
no
protested
juan
by
this
time
the
indian
gamblers
had
leaped
to
their
feet
an
ugly
light
in
their
eyes
that
boded
ill
for
the
pony
rider
boy
who
had
interrupted
them
in
the
process
of
fleecing
the
mexican
with
one
accord
they
barred
the
way
in
a
solid
human
wall
tad
found
himself
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
it
had
been
easy
to
gain
an
entrance
to
the
circle
but
getting
out
of
it
was
another
matter
this
man
belongs
to
me
he
said
with
as
much
courage
in
his
tone
as
he
was
able
to
command
you
will
please
step
aside
and
let
us
go
you
breaking
the
law
if
you
offer
any
resistance
i
have
the
government
officers
after
you
in
short
order
he
could
not
have
said
a
worse
thing
under
the
circumstances
at
first
they
took
him
for
a
spy
possibly
a
government
spy
now
they
were
sure
of
it
for
had
not
the
lad
told
them
so
himself
with
a
growl
one
who
appeared
to
be
the
most
important
personage
in
the
group
drew
his
sheath
knife
and
sprang
straight
at
the
slender
figure
of
tad
butler
tad
acted
without
an
instant
hesitation
stepping
aside
quickly
he
cleverly
avoided
the
at
the
same
instant
while
the
indian
was
off
his
balance
not
yet
having
recovered
from
the
lunge
the
pony
rider
boy
fist
and
the
jaw
met
in
sudden
collision
the
impact
of
the
blow
might
have
been
heard
more
than
a
rod
away
the
red
man
blanket
dropped
from
his
shoulders
he
staggered
backward
made
a
supreme
effort
to
pull
himself
together
then
dropped
in
a
heap
at
the
feet
of
the
boy
who
had
felled
him
without
waiting
for
the
astonished
red
gamblers
to
recover
their
wits
tad
grasped
an
arm
of
the
mexican
and
sprang
away
into
the
bushes
he
had
done
a
serious
thing
even
though
in
he
had
knocked
down
an
apache
brave
with
his
fist
the
sting
of
that
blow
would
rest
upon
the
savage
jaw
until
the
insult
was
wiped
out
by
the
victim
himself
chapter
vi
the
fire
dance
of
the
red
men
the
indians
made
a
sudden
move
to
pursue
the
lad
who
had
done
so
daring
a
thing
one
of
their
number
restrained
them
pointing
to
the
fallen
brave
as
much
as
to
say
revenge
is
for
him
with
a
shrug
of
their
shoulders
the
indians
sank
down
and
resumed
their
game
as
stoically
as
before
they
gave
no
further
heed
to
the
unconscious
apache
who
still
lay
just
outside
the
circle
where
he
had
been
knocked
out
by
tad
blow
hurry
hurry
commanded
the
lad
fairly
dragging
his
companion
along
they
be
after
us
in
a
minute
yet
before
the
minute
had
elapsed
tad
had
halted
suddenly
his
wondering
eyes
fixed
upon
the
scene
that
was
being
enacted
before
him
about
a
pit
of
red
hot
coals
naked
save
for
the
breech
clouts
they
wore
swayed
the
bodies
of
powerful
braves
they
were
the
fire
dancers
and
tad
was
gazing
upon
a
scene
that
probably
never
will
be
seen
again
in
this
country
the
last
of
the
fire
dances
a
secret
dance
of
which
it
was
to
be
supposed
the
government
agents
knew
nothing
back
and
forth
waved
the
line
right
up
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
of
glowing
coals
uttering
a
weird
chant
which
was
taken
up
by
others
who
were
not
in
the
dance
the
voices
of
the
chanters
grew
louder
their
excitement
waxed
higher
as
the
thrill
of
song
and
dance
pulsed
through
their
veins
all
at
once
tad
was
horrified
to
see
one
of
the
dancers
leap
into
the
air
uttering
a
mighty
shriek
while
still
clear
of
the
ground
the
dancer
body
turned
then
he
dove
head
first
into
the
bed
of
hot
coals
he
was
out
in
an
instant
the
chant
rose
higher
as
the
remaining
dancers
followed
the
leader
into
the
burning
pit
and
out
of
it
so
quickly
did
they
move
that
they
seemed
not
to
feel
the
heat
and
from
tad
point
of
vantage
he
was
sure
that
none
was
burned
in
the
slightest
juan
tried
to
pull
away
but
tad
held
him
in
a
firm
grip
now
that
the
dancers
had
passed
through
the
fire
unscathed
others
followed
them
some
no
more
than
touching
the
live
coals
then
bounding
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
pit
others
remaining
long
enough
to
roll
swiftly
across
the
glowing
bed
excitement
was
rapidly
waxing
higher
and
higher
the
red
men
were
in
a
dangerous
mood
it
boded
ill
for
the
paleface
who
sought
to
interfere
with
their
carnival
at
this
moment
come
whispered
tad
in
a
low
tense
voice
we
got
to
get
out
of
this
mighty
quick
chunky
probably
half
scared
to
death
too
tad
did
not
go
far
he
had
scarcely
taken
half
a
dozen
steps
when
a
frenzied
yell
a
series
of
shrill
shrieks
sounded
in
the
air
the
sounds
seemed
to
come
from
all
directions
at
once
what
that
me
not
know
somebody
running
a
pony
i
hear
it
coming
it
headed
right
for
that
bunch
of
crazy
savages
probably
an
indian
gone
mad
it
was
not
an
indian
who
was
the
cause
of
this
new
disturbance
as
the
lad
discovered
almost
immediately
afterward
yip
yip
the
yells
were
uttered
in
the
shrill
voice
of
stacy
brown
it
chunky
groaned
tad
here
trouble
in
earnest
they
never
knew
just
how
it
happened
and
chunky
could
not
tell
them
but
in
all
probability
the
excitement
had
been
too
much
for
the
fat
boy
he
had
moved
closer
when
the
dancing
began
and
the
fever
of
it
got
into
his
veins
until
his
excitement
had
reached
a
pitch
beyond
his
control
with
a
series
of
howls
and
yells
the
fat
boy
drove
the
rowels
of
the
spurs
deep
into
his
pony
aides
the
animal
dashed
forward
at
a
pace
stacy
headed
straight
for
the
glowing
pit
yelling
with
every
leap
of
the
pony
tad
gazed
spellbound
he
seemed
powerless
to
move
he
had
been
deeply
affected
by
the
scenes
he
had
seen
but
this
was
different
the
lad
held
his
breath
reaching
the
edge
of
the
pit
stacy
pony
rose
in
the
air
clearing
the
bed
of
coals
in
a
long
curving
leap
two
red
men
had
just
risen
from
their
fiery
bath
the
hind
hoofs
of
the
pony
caught
and
bowled
them
over
run
to
the
camp
and
get
help
take
my
pony
ride
for
your
life
lose
a
second
gasped
tad
giving
the
lazy
mexican
a
shove
that
sent
him
stumbling
until
he
had
measured
his
length
upon
the
ground
juan
picked
himself
up
slowly
and
crawling
away
into
the
bushes
lay
down
to
rest
or
hide
stacy
pony
landed
fairly
in
the
center
of
a
bunch
of
savages
some
of
whom
went
down
under
the
pony
when
it
landed
on
them
so
unexpectedly
the
next
instant
the
fat
boy
had
been
jerked
from
the
animal
back
to
which
he
was
clinging
desperately
with
a
yell
the
redskins
hurled
him
toward
the
fire
but
the
force
of
the
throw
had
not
been
quite
strong
enough
stacy
landed
on
the
edge
of
the
pit
rolling
half
into
it
the
upper
part
of
his
body
being
on
the
ground
to
which
he
was
hanging
yelling
lustily
his
shod
feet
were
in
the
fire
however
but
as
yet
he
did
not
realize
that
his
clothes
were
burning
tad
butler
sprang
quickly
from
his
hiding
place
crawl
out
he
roared
you
be
burned
alive
i
i
ca
i
fell
in
piped
stacy
all
his
bravery
gone
now
tad
leaped
across
the
intervening
space
and
bounded
to
the
side
of
his
companion
ouch
i
on
fire
shrieked
stacy
tad
grabbed
and
hauled
him
from
his
dangerous
position
one
of
feet
slipped
in
while
he
was
doing
so
by
this
time
the
clothes
of
both
lads
had
begun
to
smoulder
run
for
it
better
be
burned
than
scalped
shouted
tad
holding
to
chunky
arm
the
pony
rider
boy
started
to
run
he
was
tripped
by
a
moccasined
foot
before
they
had
gone
ten
feet
both
boys
fell
headlong
ere
they
could
rise
half
a
dozen
mad
savages
were
upon
them
the
lads
were
jerked
roughly
to
their
feet
chunky
shivering
tad
pale
but
resolute
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
say
or
do
to
repair
the
damage
that
his
companion
had
done
one
whom
the
lad
took
to
be
a
chief
from
his
and
commanding
appearance
pushed
his
way
into
the
crowd
about
the
two
boys
hurling
the
red
men
aside
with
reckless
sweeps
of
his
powerful
arms
ugh
he
grunted
folding
his
arms
and
gazing
sternly
at
the
two
prisoners
who
you
tad
explained
as
best
he
could
why
you
do
this
my
friend
here
got
excited
tad
declared
huh
lie
tad
face
burned
he
could
scarcely
resist
the
impulse
to
resent
the
imputation
that
the
savage
had
cast
upon
him
he
conquered
the
inclination
with
an
effort
sir
we
had
no
wish
to
interfere
with
you
we
came
here
to
get
one
of
our
men
who
had
come
here
to
gamble
if
you
will
release
us
we
will
return
to
our
camp
and
give
you
no
further
trouble
i
promise
you
that
so
chattered
chunky
keep
still
whispered
tad
you
get
us
into
more
trouble
the
chief
appeared
to
be
debating
the
question
in
his
own
mind
when
one
of
the
men
whom
tad
recognized
as
a
member
of
the
gambling
circle
whispered
something
to
the
chief
the
chief
eyes
blazed
uttering
a
succession
of
gutteral
sounds
he
gave
some
quick
directions
to
the
red
men
near
him
he
makes
a
noise
like
a
litter
of
pigs
muttered
chunky
acting
upon
the
chief
direction
two
braves
grabbed
the
lads
and
hurried
them
away
tad
meanwhile
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
break
away
had
he
been
alone
he
felt
sure
he
could
do
so
safely
but
he
would
not
leave
his
companion
of
course
the
apaches
took
the
boys
a
short
distance
from
the
camp
planked
them
down
roughly
with
their
backs
to
a
rock
now
i
wonder
what
next
muttered
tad
while
one
of
the
braves
stood
guard
over
them
the
second
trotted
back
to
the
camp
returning
after
a
few
minutes
with
a
third
savage
who
carried
a
rifle
the
boys
were
sure
then
that
they
were
to
be
shot
huh
you
run
brave
shoot
um
warned
one
of
the
first
pair
after
which
parting
injunction
the
two
captors
strode
away
leaving
their
companion
to
guard
the
boys
for
a
few
moments
the
indian
walked
up
and
down
in
front
of
them
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
lads
tad
noted
that
he
walked
rather
unsteadily
finally
the
guard
sat
down
facing
them
some
ten
feet
away
well
you
certainly
gone
and
done
it
this
time
chunky
said
tad
in
a
low
voice
what
on
earth
made
you
do
a
crazy
thing
like
that
i
i
do
know
well
it
too
late
for
regrets
all
we
can
do
will
be
to
make
the
best
of
our
situation
and
watch
for
an
opportunity
to
get
away
for
several
minutes
the
boys
sat
gazing
at
the
stolid
figure
before
them
tad
mind
was
working
though
his
body
was
not
make
believe
you
going
to
sleep
but
do
overdo
it
whispered
tad
this
was
something
that
stacy
could
do
and
he
did
it
with
such
naturalness
that
tad
could
not
repress
a
smile
that
indian
is
dazed
from
his
excitement
and
if
we
make
him
think
we
asleep
he
likely
to
relax
his
vigilance
mused
tad
as
the
two
boys
gradually
leaned
closer
together
soon
to
all
appearances
being
wrapped
in
sleep
little
by
little
the
indian
head
nodded
finally
he
toppled
over
to
one
side
the
rifle
lying
across
his
feet
tad
and
chunky
remained
motionless
the
indian
snored
the
boys
waited
soon
the
snores
became
regular
the
moment
for
action
had
arrived
tad
pinched
chunky
huh
want
the
fat
boy
had
in
reality
been
asleep
for
goodness
sake
keep
quiet
begged
tad
in
a
whisper
do
you
know
there
an
indian
with
a
gun
guarding
us
he
asleep
come
but
be
quiet
if
you
value
your
life
at
all
anyway
remember
that
i
want
to
save
mine
stacy
was
wide
awake
now
together
the
lads
crawled
cautiously
away
every
nerve
on
the
alert
over
by
the
pit
of
live
coals
the
uproar
was
if
any
thing
louder
than
before
the
boys
gave
that
part
of
the
camp
a
wide
berth
now
get
up
and
run
commanded
tad
raise
your
feet
off
the
ground
so
that
you
wo
fall
over
every
pebble
you
come
to
tad
and
chunky
clasped
hands
and
scurried
through
the
bushes
making
as
little
noise
as
possible
and
rapidly
putting
considerable
distance
between
them
and
the
sleeping
red
man
who
had
been
set
to
watch
them
having
lots
of
fun
ai
we
tad
fun
you
lucky
if
you
get
off
with
a
whole
scalp
wow
exclaimed
stacy
the
lads
brought
up
suddenly
at
first
they
were
not
sure
what
had
disturbed
them
that
is
tad
was
not
this
time
stacy
had
seen
more
clearly
than
his
companion
ugh
grunted
a
voice
right
in
front
of
them
and
there
before
their
amazed
eyes
stood
an
indian
to
their
imaginations
he
was
magnified
until
he
appeared
nearly
as
tall
as
the
moonlit
mountains
in
the
background
for
one
hesitating
instant
the
lads
stood
staring
at
the
figure
looming
over
them
with
an
angry
growl
the
red
man
bounded
toward
them
he
had
recognized
the
boys
and
was
determined
that
they
should
not
escape
him
it
was
stacy
brown
wits
that
saved
the
situation
this
time
as
the
indian
came
at
them
the
fat
boy
dived
between
the
savage
naked
legs
uttering
a
short
sharp
yelp
for
all
the
world
just
like
that
of
a
small
dog
attempting
to
frighten
off
a
bigger
antagonist
there
could
be
only
one
result
following
chunky
unexpected
tactics
redskin
flattened
himself
on
the
ground
prone
upon
his
face
somehow
the
fellow
was
slightly
stunned
by
the
fall
not
having
had
time
to
save
himself
from
a
violent
bump
on
the
head
run
for
it
chunky
he
be
after
us
in
a
second
the
lads
made
a
lively
sprint
for
the
open
in
a
moment
observing
that
they
were
not
being
followed
they
halted
still
in
the
shadows
of
the
bushes
all
at
once
tad
stumbled
over
an
object
in
the
dark
at
first
he
thought
it
was
another
indian
and
both
boys
were
about
to
run
again
when
the
voice
of
the
prostrate
man
caused
them
to
laugh
instead
si
si
señor
muttered
the
fellow
juan
it
juan
get
up
you
here
yet
they
pulled
the
lazy
guide
to
his
feet
starting
off
with
him
when
all
at
once
tad
happened
to
think
that
one
of
the
ponies
was
back
there
somewhere
among
the
indians
you
stay
here
and
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
this
time
commanded
tad
where
are
you
going
after
your
pony
you
hang
on
to
juan
i
hold
you
responsible
for
him
chunky
guess
i
can
take
care
of
a
lazy
mexican
if
i
can
floor
a
redskin
answered
stacy
proudly
but
tad
was
off
he
had
not
heard
the
last
remark
of
his
companion
in
picking
his
way
carefully
around
the
camp
to
where
he
had
seen
a
lot
of
ponies
tethered
tad
found
a
navajo
blanket
he
quickly
possessed
himself
of
it
throwing
it
over
his
head
wrapping
himself
in
its
folds
he
was
now
in
plain
sight
of
the
wild
antics
of
the
dancers
who
still
mad
with
the
excitement
of
the
hour
were
performing
all
manner
of
weird
movements
for
a
moment
the
lad
squatted
down
to
watch
them
he
had
been
there
but
a
short
time
when
a
voice
at
his
side
startled
him
and
tad
was
about
to
take
a
fresh
sprint
when
he
realized
that
it
was
not
the
voice
of
a
savage
young
man
you
better
light
out
of
here
while
you
got
the
chance
said
the
stranger
turning
sharply
tad
discovered
a
man
who
like
himself
was
wrapped
in
a
gaudy
blanket
he
was
unable
to
see
the
man
face
which
was
hidden
under
the
navajo
who
are
you
demanded
the
lad
sharply
i
an
indian
agent
i
only
got
wind
of
this
proposed
fire
dance
late
this
afternoon
these
men
will
all
be
punished
unless
they
return
to
their
reservations
peaceably
if
they
do
they
will
be
let
go
with
a
warning
do
they
know
you
here
they
not
much
laughed
the
agent
but
supposing
they
ask
you
a
question
i
can
talk
all
the
different
tribal
languages
represented
here
better
go
now
where
are
you
from
tad
explained
briefly
well
you
have
had
a
narrow
escape
tonight
if
they
catch
you
again
they
make
short
work
of
you
they
wo
catch
me
thank
you
and
do
go
that
way
strike
straight
back
then
you
will
have
an
open
course
i
going
after
my
companion
pony
i
think
i
know
where
to
find
it
answered
tad
wrapping
the
blanket
about
himself
and
stealing
across
an
open
moonlit
space
without
attracting
attention
the
indian
agent
watched
him
curiously
for
a
moment
then
he
rose
and
followed
quickly
after
tad
that
boy
is
either
a
fool
which
i
do
think
or
else
he
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
tad
did
not
find
stacy
pony
where
he
had
expected
indian
ponies
were
tethered
all
about
singly
and
in
groups
while
here
and
there
one
was
left
to
graze
where
it
would
what
sort
of
a
looking
pony
is
yours
questioned
the
agent
coming
up
to
him
a
roan
then
i
think
i
know
where
he
is
he
was
not
like
the
horses
in
this
vicinity
which
attracted
my
attention
to
him
the
agent
led
the
way
in
a
roundabout
course
to
the
south
side
of
the
camp
where
they
began
looking
over
the
animals
occasionally
a
redskin
would
pass
them
but
no
one
gave
either
the
slightest
heed
here
he
is
whispered
tad
lead
him
off
do
mount
just
yet
tad
did
as
the
agent
had
suggested
but
all
at
once
something
happened
tad
blanket
had
dropped
from
his
shoulders
revealing
him
in
his
true
colors
an
indian
uttered
a
yell
tad
sprang
into
his
saddle
and
put
spurs
to
the
pony
in
a
moment
more
than
a
dozen
redskins
had
mounted
and
started
yelling
after
him
believing
he
was
stealing
a
pony
tad
headed
away
to
the
south
to
give
his
companions
a
chance
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
the
savages
came
in
full
cry
after
him
chapter
vii
fleeing
from
the
enemy
a
shrill
cry
was
wafted
to
the
boy
after
a
few
moments
tad
realized
that
they
were
no
longer
on
his
trail
he
knew
the
cry
had
been
a
signal
warning
them
to
halt
what
he
did
not
know
however
was
that
the
indian
agent
had
been
responsible
for
the
signal
that
he
in
all
probability
had
saved
the
boy
life
the
lad
after
satisfying
himself
that
the
indians
had
abandoned
the
chase
at
once
circled
about
coming
back
to
the
point
where
he
had
left
chunky
and
the
mexican
they
were
both
there
waiting
for
him
what
was
all
that
row
demanded
the
fat
boy
we
were
having
a
little
horse
race
that
all
grinned
tad
grimly
hurry
along
now
they
reached
their
own
camp
in
safety
an
hour
later
the
two
boys
had
much
to
relate
and
as
the
narration
proceeded
professor
zepplin
shook
his
head
disapprovingly
young
gentlemen
much
as
i
have
enjoyed
this
summer
outing
it
a
wonder
i
have
had
nervous
prostration
long
before
this
it
be
a
load
off
my
mind
if
i
get
you
all
back
in
chillicothe
without
anything
serious
happening
to
you
i
think
suggested
tad
that
we
had
better
strike
camp
at
once
and
move
on
the
moon
is
shining
brightly
and
juan
ought
to
have
no
trouble
in
leading
the
way
yes
that
will
be
an
excellent
idea
you
think
they
may
give
as
further
trouble
questioned
the
professor
they
may
before
morning
they
getting
more
ugly
every
minute
everything
worth
while
seems
to
happen
when
i
am
not
around
protested
ned
good
thing
you
were
along
replied
stacy
you
been
scared
stiff
it
was
no
place
for
tenderfeet
you
you
call
me
a
tenderfoot
snapped
ned
starting
for
him
stop
quarreling
you
two
commanded
tad
we
had
all
the
fighting
we
want
for
one
night
get
busy
and
help
strike
this
camp
guess
none
of
this
outfit
could
truthfully
be
called
a
tenderfoot
we
all
had
our
share
of
hard
knocks
and
we
have
enough
to
look
back
to
and
think
about
when
we
get
home
and
have
time
to
go
over
our
experiences
together
this
winter
the
thought
that
at
any
minute
the
savages
might
sweep
down
on
them
hastened
the
preparations
for
departure
the
pony
rider
boys
never
struck
camp
more
quickly
than
they
did
in
the
soft
southern
moonlight
that
night
all
at
once
juan
set
up
a
wail
what
is
it
what
the
trouble
now
demanded
tad
my
burro
i
go
for
him
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
you
walk
or
ride
a
pack
animal
answered
stacy
you
do
deserve
to
have
a
burro
here
his
old
burro
now
called
walter
as
a
shambling
object
much
the
worse
for
wear
came
stumbling
sleepily
into
camp
the
boys
set
up
a
shout
that
was
quickly
checked
by
tad
if
the
burro
can
find
the
way
what
do
you
think
an
indian
could
do
fellows
that
right
agreed
professor
zepplin
we
had
better
keep
quiet
and
hit
the
trail
as
fast
as
possible
added
tad
daylight
must
find
us
a
long
ways
from
here
and
ride
all
night
is
that
what
you
mean
complained
stacy
yes
it
give
you
an
appetite
for
breakfast
i
got
one
already
that
goes
without
saying
agreed
ned
come
come
juan
urged
tad
observing
that
the
guide
was
doing
nothing
more
in
the
way
of
work
than
rubbing
the
nose
of
his
prodigal
burro
are
you
going
to
help
us
yes
what
do
you
think
we
paying
you
good
american
dollars
for
demanded
ned
i
think
some
of
the
professor
hot
drops
would
be
good
for
what
ails
him
observed
stacy
brown
i
get
the
professor
to
give
him
a
dose
right
now
no
no
no
juan
no
want
fire
drops
all
right
get
busy
then
he
did
not
since
the
last
dose
of
the
professor
medicine
had
he
shown
such
activity
very
soon
after
that
the
camp
had
been
struck
and
the
party
was
ready
to
take
up
its
journey
tad
took
a
last
look
about
to
make
sure
that
nothing
had
been
left
i
think
i
put
out
the
fire
he
said
tossing
the
bridle
reins
to
stacy
while
he
ran
over
to
the
dying
whose
embers
he
kicked
apart
stamping
them
out
one
by
one
no
use
leaving
a
trail
like
that
for
any
prowling
redskin
they
were
quickly
under
way
after
that
juan
leading
the
way
without
the
least
hesitancy
he
and
the
burro
worked
together
like
a
piece
of
automatic
machinery
he
might
better
walk
and
lead
the
burro
said
stacy
who
had
been
observing
their
peculiar
method
of
locomotion
should
think
it
would
be
easier
the
moon
was
dropping
slowly
westward
and
the
party
was
using
it
for
a
guide
keeping
the
silver
ball
sharply
to
their
right
juan
on
the
other
hand
had
hitched
his
lazy
chariot
to
a
star
by
this
star
he
was
laying
his
course
to
the
southward
the
pony
rider
boys
enjoyed
their
moonlight
trip
immensely
and
a
gentle
breeze
from
the
desert
drifting
over
them
relieved
the
scorching
heat
of
the
late
afternoon
and
early
evening
guess
the
indians
are
not
going
to
bother
us
said
walter
riding
up
to
tad
just
before
daylight
probably
not
they
will
be
in
too
much
trouble
with
the
government
after
last
night
performances
to
give
much
thought
to
chasing
us
and
besides
i
do
see
why
they
should
wish
to
do
so
had
they
been
very
anxious
to
be
revenged
on
us
most
likely
they
would
not
have
allowed
us
to
get
away
as
they
did
was
it
very
terrible
tad
asked
walter
perkins
what
the
dance
or
what
happened
afterwards
laughed
the
lad
both
well
i
free
to
confess
that
neither
was
exactly
pleasant
when
they
caught
chunky
i
thought
it
was
all
up
with
us
hello
there
mr
daylight
glancing
to
the
left
the
boys
saw
the
sky
turning
to
gray
a
buzzard
screamed
overhead
laying
its
course
for
the
mountains
where
it
was
journeying
in
search
of
food
what
that
demanded
stacy
awakening
from
a
doze
in
his
saddle
friend
of
yours
with
an
appetite
grinned
ned
i
thought
it
sounded
like
breakfast
call
muttered
stacy
relapsing
into
sleep
again
his
head
drooping
forward
until
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
lying
over
the
saddle
pommel
with
arms
thrown
loosely
about
the
pony
neck
ned
observing
the
lad
position
suddenly
conceived
a
mischievous
plan
unnoticed
by
the
others
he
permitted
his
own
pony
to
fall
back
until
he
was
a
short
distance
behind
stacy
the
others
were
a
little
way
ahead
ned
rode
slowly
alongside
his
companion
as
he
passed
bringing
the
rowel
of
his
spur
sharply
against
the
withers
of
chunky
mount
the
effect
was
instantaneous
the
fat
boy
mount
itself
half
asleep
suddenly
humped
its
back
and
with
bunching
feet
leaped
clear
of
the
ground
hello
what
the
matter
back
there
called
ned
who
by
this
time
was
a
full
rod
in
advance
of
his
companion
stacy
did
not
answer
he
was
at
that
moment
turning
an
undignified
somersault
in
the
air
his
pony
standing
meekly
awaiting
the
next
act
in
the
little
drama
the
fat
boy
landed
on
the
plain
in
a
heap
are
you
hurt
chunky
cried
tad
anxiously
slipping
from
his
saddle
and
running
to
his
companion
i
i
dunno
i
i
fell
off
did
i
you
off
at
least
grinned
ned
what
was
the
matter
i
i
dunno
do
you
how
should
i
know
if
you
will
go
to
sleep
an
a
bucking
broncho
you
must
expect
things
to
happen
stacy
by
this
time
had
scrambled
to
his
feet
after
which
he
began
a
careful
inventory
of
himself
to
make
sure
that
he
was
all
there
he
grinned
sheepishly
satisfying
himself
on
this
point
stacy
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
over
to
his
pony
with
a
suggestion
of
a
limp
now
that
we
have
halted
we
might
as
well
make
camp
for
a
few
hours
get
breakfast
and
take
a
nap
suggested
the
professor
the
boys
welcomed
this
proposition
gratefully
for
they
were
beginning
to
feel
the
effects
of
their
long
night
ride
added
to
which
two
of
them
had
had
a
series
of
trying
experiences
before
starting
out
in
the
meantime
stacy
brown
had
been
examining
his
pony
with
more
than
usual
care
tad
observed
his
action
and
wondered
at
it
a
moment
later
the
fat
boy
having
moved
away
tad
thought
he
would
take
a
look
at
the
animal
he
was
curious
to
know
what
stacy
had
in
mind
so
that
it
is
it
muttered
tad
he
found
the
mark
of
a
spur
on
the
pony
withers
while
it
had
not
punctured
the
skin
the
spur
had
raked
the
coat
showing
that
the
rowel
had
been
applied
with
considerable
force
tad
with
a
covert
glance
about
saw
ned
rector
watching
him
you
the
guilty
one
eh
he
demanded
walking
up
to
ned
cautioned
ned
he
be
redheaded
if
he
knows
i
am
to
blame
for
his
coming
a
cropper
chunky
not
so
slow
as
you
might
think
but
that
was
a
nice
thing
to
do
it
all
right
to
play
tricks
but
i
hope
you
wo
be
so
cruel
as
to
use
a
spur
on
a
dumb
animal
the
way
you
did
even
if
he
is
an
broncho
you
might
have
broken
chunky
neck
too
ned
face
flushed
it
was
a
mean
trick
i
admit
did
strike
me
so
at
the
time
shall
i
ask
chunky
pardon
do
as
you
think
best
i
should
were
i
in
your
place
then
i
will
after
breakfast
ned
got
busy
at
once
assisting
to
cook
the
morning
meal
while
juan
led
the
ponies
out
to
a
patch
of
grass
and
staked
them
down
while
the
pony
rider
cook
was
thus
engaged
he
felt
a
tug
at
his
coat
sleeve
turning
sharply
ned
found
stacy
at
his
side
stacy
face
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
were
snapping
what
is
it
chunky
come
over
here
i
want
to
talk
with
you
they
stepped
off
a
few
paces
out
of
hearing
of
the
others
tad
smiling
to
himself
as
he
observed
stacy
act
well
what
the
matter
chunky
i
can
lick
you
ned
rector
wha
what
said
i
could
lick
you
did
say
i
was
going
to
understand
just
said
i
could
like
to
see
you
try
it
all
right
it
a
go
ere
ned
could
recover
from
his
surprise
stacy
brown
had
launched
himself
upon
his
companion
one
of
stacy
arms
went
about
ned
neck
one
foot
kicked
a
leg
from
under
ned
and
the
two
lads
went
down
in
the
dust
together
it
had
happened
in
a
twinkling
here
here
what
going
on
over
there
shouted
the
professor
starting
on
a
run
while
the
other
lads
were
laughing
chunky
was
sitting
on
the
chest
of
his
fallen
adversary
ned
struggling
desperately
to
throw
the
lad
off
crowed
chunky
in
imitation
of
a
rooster
flapping
his
hands
on
his
thighs
in
great
good
humor
with
himself
professor
zepplin
grabbed
him
by
the
collar
jerking
stacy
brown
from
the
fallen
pony
rider
boy
ned
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
with
a
sheepish
grin
on
his
face
proceeded
to
brush
the
dust
from
his
clothes
downed
you
did
he
questioned
tad
it
was
fair
i
did
know
he
was
going
to
try
neither
did
the
russians
when
the
japs
sailed
into
them
at
port
arthur
laughed
walter
and
they
got
what
was
coming
to
them
so
did
chunky
i
deserve
more
than
you
gave
me
if
you
want
to
beat
me
up
some
more
now
is
that
sweet
of
him
chortled
stacy
i
fell
off
my
pony
then
i
fell
on
you
and
we
call
it
quits
eh
ned
ned
put
out
a
hand
which
stacy
grasped
with
mock
enthusiasm
we
sure
will
i
like
to
know
what
this
is
all
about
questioned
walter
something
been
going
on
i
made
his
pony
throw
him
over
admitted
ned
stacy
nodded
with
emphasis
he
found
it
out
and
jumped
on
me
i
turn
you
both
over
my
knee
if
you
try
to
repeat
these
performances
warned
the
professor
linking
arms
stacy
and
ned
started
for
the
breakfast
table
humming
for
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
and
a
moment
later
all
four
of
the
lads
were
standing
about
the
breakfast
table
singing
the
chorus
at
the
top
of
their
voices
chapter
viii
asleep
on
the
sleepy
grass
the
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
got
into
the
eyes
of
the
pony
rider
boys
four
arms
were
thrown
over
as
many
pairs
of
eyes
to
shut
out
the
blinding
light
yawned
chunky
cocking
an
impish
eye
at
his
companions
he
observed
that
each
had
fallen
into
a
deep
sleep
again
the
fat
boy
cautiously
gathered
up
a
handful
of
dry
sand
and
hurled
it
into
the
air
a
shower
of
it
sprinkled
over
them
into
their
eyes
and
mouths
three
pairs
of
eyes
were
opened
then
closed
again
encouraged
by
his
success
stacy
chuckled
softly
to
himself
then
dumped
another
handful
of
sand
over
his
companions
but
he
was
not
prepared
for
what
followed
three
muscular
boys
hurled
themselves
upon
him
instantly
the
peaceful
scene
was
changed
into
a
pandemonium
of
yells
down
came
the
tent
poles
the
canvas
rising
and
falling
as
if
imbued
with
sudden
life
professor
zepplin
startled
by
the
racket
roused
himself
and
sprang
from
his
own
tent
observing
the
erratic
actions
of
the
tent
in
which
the
boys
had
been
sleeping
he
instantly
concluded
that
something
serious
had
happened
boys
boys
he
cried
running
to
the
spot
frantically
hauling
away
the
canvas
what
has
happened
what
has
happened
they
were
too
busy
to
answer
him
when
finally
he
had
uncovered
what
lay
below
he
found
his
charges
literally
tied
up
in
a
knot
rolling
and
tumbling
with
stacy
brown
lying
flat
on
his
back
each
of
his
three
companions
vigorously
rubbing
handfuls
of
sand
over
his
face
down
his
neck
and
in
the
hair
of
his
head
i
think
i
take
a
hand
in
this
myself
smiled
the
professor
he
ran
to
his
tent
returning
quickly
in
his
hands
he
carried
two
pails
of
water
unluckily
for
the
boys
they
had
failed
to
observe
what
he
was
doing
nor
did
they
understand
that
they
were
in
danger
until
the
contents
of
the
two
pails
had
been
dashed
over
them
there
were
yells
in
earnest
this
time
the
water
turned
the
dirt
into
mud
at
once
and
their
faces
were
sights
stacy
face
had
been
protected
in
a
measure
by
the
other
boys
who
were
bending
over
him
rubbing
in
the
sand
the
unexpected
bath
put
a
sudden
end
to
their
sport
and
they
staggered
out
shouting
for
vengeance
they
did
not
even
know
who
had
been
the
cause
of
their
undoing
the
professor
as
he
walked
away
smiling
had
handed
the
pails
to
the
grinning
juan
with
instructions
to
refill
them
the
unfortunate
juan
bearing
the
pails
away
was
the
first
person
to
catch
the
eyes
of
the
lads
as
they
rubbed
the
sticky
mud
out
of
them
with
a
howl
they
projected
themselves
upon
him
juan
grin
changed
instantly
to
an
expression
of
great
concern
he
went
down
under
their
charge
with
four
boys
instead
of
three
on
top
of
him
duck
him
shouted
some
one
yes
douse
him
in
the
spring
chorused
the
boys
juan
cried
out
for
the
professor
but
his
appeals
were
in
vain
shouting
in
high
glee
the
lads
bore
him
to
the
spring
from
which
they
got
their
water
they
plumped
him
in
not
any
too
gently
again
and
again
now
roll
him
in
the
sand
suggested
ned
they
did
so
the
wet
clothing
and
body
made
the
sand
stick
to
him
until
the
lazy
mexican
was
scarcely
recognizable
at
this
point
professor
zepplin
took
a
hand
he
came
bounding
to
the
scene
and
began
throwing
the
boys
roughly
from
their
unhappy
victim
perhaps
he
was
not
greatly
disturbed
over
the
shaking
up
the
guide
had
sustained
but
of
course
he
confided
nothing
of
this
to
the
boys
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
for
four
of
you
to
pitch
on
to
one
weak
mexican
i
surprised
young
gentlemen
but
but
he
ducked
us
protested
ned
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
what
did
duck
us
guess
i
know
water
when
i
feel
it
objected
walter
you
were
ducked
all
right
but
it
is
i
not
juan
who
am
responsible
for
that
you
questioned
the
lads
all
at
once
the
professor
nodded
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
but
he
had
the
pails
i
gave
them
to
him
after
pouring
the
water
over
you
that
what
is
known
as
circumstantial
evidence
young
gentlemen
let
it
be
a
lesson
to
you
to
be
careful
how
you
convict
anyone
on
that
kind
of
evidence
fellows
glowed
chunky
we
made
a
mistake
let
make
it
right
by
ducking
the
professor
the
boys
looked
over
professor
zepplin
critically
i
guess
we
better
defer
that
job
till
we
grow
some
more
they
decided
with
a
laugh
the
next
fifteen
minutes
were
fully
occupied
in
cleaning
up
and
putting
on
their
clothes
they
were
all
thoroughly
awake
now
with
cheeks
flushed
and
eyes
sparkling
after
their
violent
exercise
the
guide
had
rather
sullenly
washed
off
the
wet
dust
that
clung
to
his
face
and
hands
never
mind
the
clothes
juan
advised
ned
it
brush
off
as
soon
as
it
gets
dry
we
take
up
a
contribution
to
buy
you
a
clothes
brush
ever
see
one
juan
grinned
you
promise
not
to
gamble
the
money
away
if
we
give
it
to
you
si
shell
out
fellows
ten
cents
apiece
that
ought
to
salve
his
injured
feelings
ned
passed
the
hat
all
contributing
that
makes
forty
cents
here
professor
you
have
put
in
your
ten
yet
it
take
just
fifty
cents
to
paste
up
juan
injuries
that
reminds
me
of
a
fellow
i
heard
about
once
announced
stacy
are
you
going
to
tell
a
story
questioned
ned
if
you
will
keep
still
long
enough
replied
stacy
then
me
for
the
bunch
grass
it
like
going
to
a
funeral
to
hear
chunky
try
to
tell
a
story
let
him
tell
it
shouted
the
lads
go
on
chunky
never
mind
ned
he
laugh
when
he
gets
back
to
chillicothe
jibed
walter
i
heard
of
a
fellow
once
yes
you
told
us
that
before
jeered
ned
not
the
one
we
ducked
in
the
spring
was
it
grinned
tad
who
telling
this
story
demanded
stacy
belligerently
you
are
i
guess
i
wo
interrupt
again
well
did
i
say
this
fellow
was
a
boy
no
well
he
was
he
grown
up
now
he
rushed
into
a
drug
store
was
anything
chasing
him
asked
ned
innocently
stacy
gave
no
heed
to
the
interruption
and
he
said
to
the
man
in
the
store
sir
some
liniment
and
some
cement
asked
the
clerk
all
in
a
muddle
you
see
he
never
had
a
prescription
like
that
to
fill
before
it
made
him
tired
he
thought
the
kid
was
making
fun
of
him
what
the
trouble
what
do
you
want
liniment
and
cement
for
said
the
boy
to
the
pill
man
cause
mom
hit
pop
on
the
head
with
a
plate
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
the
boys
roared
but
ned
never
smiled
laugh
laugh
why
do
you
laugh
urged
walter
laugh
huh
i
laughed
myself
almost
sick
over
that
a
long
time
ago
read
it
in
an
almanac
when
i
was
in
short
trousers
the
ponies
the
ponies
cried
juan
rushing
up
to
them
waving
his
arms
then
running
his
fingers
through
his
long
black
hair
until
it
stood
up
like
the
quills
of
a
porcupine
what
queried
the
pony
rider
boys
in
sudden
alarm
what
the
matter
with
the
ponies
juan
pointed
to
the
place
where
the
stock
had
been
tethered
after
they
arrived
at
the
camp
there
was
not
an
animal
to
be
seen
anywhere
on
the
plain
gone
gasped
the
lads
with
sinking
hearts
no
no
no
there
stammered
the
guide
with
one
accord
the
boys
ran
at
top
speed
to
the
spot
indicated
by
juan
there
stretched
out
in
the
long
grass
lay
bronchos
and
burros
they
dead
the
ponies
are
dead
every
one
of
them
cried
the
lads
aghast
chapter
ix
the
midnight
alarm
what
this
what
this
demanded
the
professor
striding
up
look
look
the
ponies
are
dead
exclaimed
ned
excitedly
what
do
you
suppose
could
have
happened
to
them
stammered
walter
is
it
possible
what
the
meaning
of
this
guide
juan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
showed
his
white
teeth
in
the
meantime
tad
had
hurried
to
his
own
pony
and
was
down
on
his
knees
examining
it
placing
his
hands
on
the
animal
side
he
remained
in
that
position
for
an
instant
then
sprang
up
they
not
dead
fellows
they
alive
asleep
grumbled
ned
disgustedly
but
there
something
the
matter
with
them
something
has
happened
to
the
stock
added
tad
only
a
false
alarm
nodded
stacy
think
so
try
to
wake
your
pony
up
advised
tad
stacy
had
already
hurried
to
his
own
broncho
and
now
began
tugging
at
the
bridle
rein
with
sundry
pokes
in
the
animal
ribs
i
ca
he
in
a
trance
wailed
stacy
considerably
startled
that
expression
came
nearer
to
describing
the
condition
of
the
stock
than
any
other
words
could
have
done
guide
what
do
you
know
about
this
questioned
the
professor
has
some
one
been
tampering
with
our
animals
juan
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
indifference
no
bother
bronchs
then
will
you
please
tell
us
what
is
the
matter
with
them
sleepy
grass
sleepy
grass
chorused
the
lads
of
course
they
asleep
all
right
added
ned
but
whoever
heard
of
sleepy
grass
he
means
they
sleeping
on
the
grass
stacy
informed
them
ah
i
begin
to
understand
nodded
the
professor
i
think
i
know
what
the
trouble
is
now
the
guide
is
no
doubt
right
the
boys
gathered
around
him
all
curiosity
tell
us
about
it
professor
we
are
very
much
mystified
said
the
pony
riders
a
long
time
ago
i
remember
to
have
read
somewhere
of
a
certain
grass
in
this
region
that
possessed
peculiar
narcotic
properties
what
narcotic
interrupted
stacy
something
that
makes
you
go
to
sleep
when
you
ca
explained
tad
butler
rather
ambiguously
when
eaten
by
horses
or
cattle
it
is
said
to
put
them
into
deep
sleep
the
rockefeller
institute
i
believe
is
already
making
an
analytical
test
of
the
grass
please
talk
so
i
can
understand
it
begged
stacy
yes
those
words
make
my
head
ache
scowled
ned
even
the
guide
is
making
up
faces
in
his
effort
to
understand
he
does
understand
he
understands
only
too
well
for
many
years
this
grass
has
been
known
cows
turned
out
for
the
day
would
fail
to
return
at
night
to
be
milked
interjected
stacy
and
an
investigation
would
disclose
them
sleeping
in
some
region
where
the
sleepy
grass
grew
and
the
fat
boy
hummed
down
where
the
sleepy
grass
is
growing
travelers
who
have
tied
out
their
horses
in
patches
of
the
grass
for
the
night
have
been
unable
to
continue
their
journey
until
the
animals
recovered
from
their
strange
sleep
thus
the
properties
of
the
grass
became
known
indians
use
to
tame
bad
bronchos
the
guide
informed
them
just
so
but
when
will
they
wake
up
questioned
tad
mebby
answered
juan
glancing
up
at
the
sky
what
sleep
hours
demanded
ned
si
preposterous
then
then
we
got
to
remain
here
all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
and
night
is
that
it
demanded
tad
it
looks
that
way
and
you
knew
about
this
stuff
juan
questioned
tad
si
well
you
a
nice
sort
of
a
guide
i
must
say
you
ought
to
be
put
off
the
reservation
threatened
stacy
shaking
a
menacing
fist
in
front
of
the
white
teeth
in
the
meantime
tad
had
gone
over
to
the
animals
again
and
taking
them
in
turn
sought
to
stir
them
up
he
found
he
could
not
do
so
the
ponies
heads
would
drop
to
the
ground
after
he
had
lifted
and
let
go
of
them
just
as
if
the
animals
were
dead
gives
you
a
creepy
feeling
does
it
shivered
walter
i
should
say
it
does
answered
ned
well
what
is
it
chunky
asked
tad
who
observed
that
stacy
had
something
on
his
mind
that
he
was
trying
to
formulate
into
words
i
got
an
idea
fellows
he
exploded
hold
on
to
it
then
you
may
never
get
another
jeered
ned
what
is
it
master
stacy
asked
the
professor
then
then
then
that
what
juan
and
his
burro
have
been
eating
all
the
time
i
knew
there
was
something
the
matter
with
them
a
loud
laugh
greeted
the
fat
boy
suggestion
guess
he
about
right
at
that
grinned
tad
a
brilliant
thought
agreed
the
professor
boys
i
must
have
some
of
that
grass
i
shall
make
some
experiments
with
it
experiment
on
chunky
they
shouted
no
he
sleeps
quite
well
enough
as
it
is
smiled
the
professor
i
want
some
of
it
too
no
not
to
eat
corrected
the
fat
boy
feed
it
to
my
aunt
cat
when
i
get
back
then
he
wo
be
running
away
from
home
every
night
better
unload
the
rest
of
the
equipment
boys
advised
the
professor
if
we
must
remain
here
all
night
we
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
without
their
ponies
the
lads
spent
rather
a
restless
afternoon
they
had
not
fully
realized
before
how
much
a
part
of
them
their
horses
had
become
until
they
were
suddenly
deprived
of
them
in
the
meantime
the
bronchos
slept
on
undisturbed
i
got
another
idea
shouted
stacy
keep
it
to
yourself
growled
ned
your
ideas
like
your
jokes
graduated
a
long
time
ago
is
there
sleepy
grass
in
the
catskill
mountains
persisted
stacy
we
do
know
and
we
do
i
know
there
is
and
that
what
put
rip
van
winkle
to
sleep
for
twenty
years
shouted
the
fat
boy
in
high
glee
see
i
know
more
than
yes
you
the
original
boy
wonder
we
take
that
for
granted
nodded
ned
rector
tad
however
was
not
inclined
to
look
upon
their
enforced
delay
with
anything
like
amusement
to
him
it
had
its
serious
side
he
had
not
forgotten
that
they
had
been
fleeing
from
the
indians
when
he
got
an
opportunity
to
do
so
without
his
companions
overhearing
he
approached
the
professor
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
plan
for
us
to
have
a
guard
over
our
camp
on
account
of
yes
very
well
i
think
myself
that
it
would
be
a
prudent
move
have
juan
sit
up
then
no
he
a
sleepy
bead
suppose
we
boys
take
turns
very
well
arrange
it
to
suit
yourselves
i
presume
we
ought
to
do
something
of
the
sort
every
night
it
might
have
saved
us
some
trouble
on
our
ozark
journey
had
we
been
that
prudent
arrange
it
to
suit
you
i
take
my
turn
no
we
can
do
it
professor
you
go
to
bed
as
usual
we
draw
lots
to
see
who
takes
the
different
watches
with
the
four
of
us
we
have
to
take
only
two
hours
apiece
that
wo
be
bad
at
all
the
other
boys
after
the
plan
had
been
explained
to
them
entered
into
it
enthusiastically
walter
was
to
take
the
first
trick
ned
the
next
chunky
the
third
and
tad
the
fourth
and
they
were
to
take
their
guns
out
with
them
the
professor
agreed
to
this
now
that
they
had
become
more
familiar
with
firearms
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
the
boys
had
developed
into
excellent
marksmen
though
tad
was
recognized
as
the
best
shot
of
the
party
professor
zepplin
during
the
afternoon
gave
each
of
them
a
lesson
in
revolver
shooting
using
for
the
purpose
his
heavy
army
revolver
they
did
pretty
well
with
this
weapon
but
of
course
were
not
nearly
as
expert
with
it
as
with
the
rifle
evening
came
and
the
stock
was
still
sleeping
soundly
there
was
nothing
the
boys
could
do
but
let
them
sleep
though
the
fact
of
all
the
ponies
and
burros
lying
about
as
if
dead
began
to
make
the
pony
riders
nervous
night
came
and
with
it
the
moon
being
overcast
with
a
veil
of
fleecy
white
clouds
which
cast
a
grayish
film
over
the
landscape
the
lads
joked
each
other
about
having
the
creeps
but
none
would
admit
the
charge
walter
with
rifle
slung
over
his
right
shoulder
went
out
on
the
first
watch
with
instructions
to
go
at
least
two
hundred
yards
from
camp
and
keep
walking
around
the
camp
in
a
circle
this
would
protect
them
from
surprises
on
all
sides
ned
decided
not
to
retire
until
he
had
taken
his
guard
trick
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
was
to
go
on
at
eleven
but
stacy
proposing
to
get
all
the
sleep
he
was
entitled
to
turned
in
early
the
rest
did
not
disturb
him
the
boys
were
unusually
quiet
that
evening
perhaps
feeling
that
the
responsibility
of
the
safety
of
the
camp
rested
wholly
upon
their
youthful
shoulders
ned
came
in
at
one
after
having
taken
his
turn
unslung
his
rifle
drew
the
cartridges
then
put
them
back
in
the
magazine
again
i
might
need
them
before
morning
he
told
himself
chunky
being
sound
asleep
ned
grabbed
him
by
a
foot
giving
him
a
violent
pull
want
get
out
growled
the
fat
boy
sleepily
get
up
and
take
your
watch
commanded
ned
who
afraid
of
indians
mumbled
stacy
this
time
ned
took
the
lad
by
the
collar
jerked
him
to
his
feet
and
shook
him
until
stacy
yelled
ouch
so
loudly
as
to
awaken
the
entire
camp
it
took
some
time
however
to
get
stacy
himself
awake
sufficiently
to
make
him
understand
that
he
had
a
duty
to
perform
finally
however
he
shouldered
his
rifle
after
surreptitiously
helping
himself
to
a
sandwich
from
the
cook
tent
then
he
marched
off
munching
the
bread
and
meat
see
here
snapped
ned
running
after
him
you
not
measuring
off
your
distance
come
back
and
pace
it
off
how
many
two
hundred
yards
stretch
your
fat
legs
as
far
as
they
go
then
you
have
a
yard
more
or
less
stacy
started
all
over
again
forgot
the
count
came
back
then
tried
it
again
even
at
that
he
was
not
sure
whether
he
had
gone
one
hundred
yards
or
five
he
was
awake
enough
now
to
observe
his
surroundings
the
cool
breezes
of
the
night
were
tossing
the
leaves
of
the
cottonwoods
near
the
water
course
to
the
west
of
them
while
here
and
there
in
the
foliage
might
be
heard
the
exultant
notes
of
a
mocking
bird
stacy
shivered
guess
it
going
to
freeze
he
decided
beginning
his
steady
tramp
about
the
camp
of
the
pony
rider
boys
muttering
to
himself
as
was
his
habit
when
alone
stacy
kept
on
until
finding
himself
opposite
the
ponies
he
decided
to
go
over
and
look
at
them
all
were
asleep
not
one
had
awakened
since
going
down
under
the
powerful
influence
of
the
sleepy
grass
i
like
to
eat
some
of
that
stuff
myself
right
now
chunky
decided
out
loud
i
have
a
good
excuse
for
going
to
sleep
then
now
i
without
getting
jumped
on
by
the
fellows
wonder
what
time
it
is
only
one
must
be
something
the
matter
with
my
watch
i
know
i
been
out
more
two
hours
this
trip
he
circled
out
further
from
the
camp
growing
a
little
more
confident
because
nothing
had
happened
to
disturb
him
in
the
meantime
the
camp
slept
in
peace
that
is
the
lads
did
until
nearly
time
for
the
change
of
guard
then
the
whole
party
was
aroused
with
the
sudden
startling
conviction
that
something
serious
had
happened
all
at
once
the
crack
of
a
rifle
sounded
on
the
still
night
air
it
was
followed
by
another
shot
and
another
until
four
distinct
reports
had
rolled
across
the
plains
in
wild
disorder
the
pony
rider
boys
tumbled
from
their
cots
and
grasping
their
weapons
leaped
from
the
tents
what
the
row
inquired
the
professor
wow
wow
wow
yeow
shrieked
a
shrill
voice
to
the
northward
it
chunky
he
giving
the
alarm
we
attacked
cried
the
lads
bang
bang
they
saw
the
flash
of
the
fat
boy
weapon
before
the
report
reached
their
ears
a
moment
later
the
other
boys
caught
sight
of
stacy
dashing
into
camp
hatless
waving
his
rifle
and
yelling
as
if
bereft
of
his
senses
what
is
it
what
is
it
cried
the
boys
with
one
voice
indians
indians
the
prairie
full
of
them
chapter
x
meeting
the
attack
instantly
the
camp
was
thrown
into
confusion
the
lads
ran
here
and
there
not
knowing
what
to
do
get
behind
the
ponies
that
the
only
cover
we
can
find
here
run
for
it
and
run
they
did
the
professor
outdistancing
all
the
rest
in
his
attempt
to
secrete
himself
where
the
enemy
weapons
would
not
be
likely
to
reach
him
in
a
moment
more
the
camp
of
the
pony
rider
boys
was
deserted
and
behind
each
sleeping
pony
lay
a
boy
with
rifle
barrel
poked
over
the
animal
back
ready
to
shoot
at
the
first
sign
of
the
redskins
stacy
in
his
excitement
had
forgotten
that
not
a
cartridge
was
left
in
his
magazine
and
the
others
were
too
fully
occupied
to
remember
to
tell
him
for
all
of
half
an
hour
did
the
party
lie
protected
the
boys
began
to
grow
restive
tad
suspicions
were
being
slowly
aroused
i
going
to
do
a
little
scouting
he
told
them
slipping
from
behind
the
pony
and
skulking
along
back
of
the
tents
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
now
he
could
see
a
long
distance
not
a
human
being
was
in
sight
i
thought
so
he
muttered
retracing
his
steps
see
here
stacy
brown
what
did
you
see
what
did
you
shoot
at
he
demanded
sternly
i
i
shot
the
chute
i
i
mean
i
chuted
the
shot
i
mean
say
what
do
you
mean
i
i
mean
say
leggo
my
neck
will
you
roared
chunky
fellows
he
does
know
what
he
means
guess
he
been
feeding
on
crazy
grass
out
on
the
prairie
was
conclusion
there
is
an
indian
anywhere
around
here
i
know
it
they
would
have
been
after
us
long
before
this
if
there
had
been
one
by
one
the
boys
came
from
their
hiding
places
the
lazy
mexican
last
disapproving
eyes
were
turned
on
stacy
chunky
you
come
along
and
show
us
where
you
were
when
you
shot
did
you
shoot
at
an
indian
asked
tad
yes
and
i
i
i
shot
him
show
us
we
all
from
chillicothe
demanded
ned
stacy
with
a
show
of
importance
led
the
way
keeping
a
wary
eye
out
for
the
enemy
it
was
noticed
however
that
each
of
the
lads
held
his
rifle
ready
for
business
in
case
there
should
be
an
enemy
about
there
i
was
standing
right
over
there
i
guess
you
guess
do
you
know
questioned
the
professor
yes
that
the
place
the
lad
walked
over
to
the
identical
spot
from
which
he
had
first
fired
his
rifle
he
was
over
there
and
i
shot
at
him
so
said
stacy
leveling
the
weapon
there
he
is
now
shrieked
the
boy
every
weapon
flashed
up
to
a
level
with
the
eyes
there
is
something
over
there
on
the
ground
decided
the
professor
put
down
your
guns
so
you
do
shoot
me
said
tad
i
going
to
find
out
what
it
is
keeping
his
own
weapon
held
at
ready
the
lad
walked
boldly
over
to
where
a
heap
of
some
sort
lay
on
the
plain
it
surely
had
not
been
there
during
the
afternoon
tad
knew
that
he
reached
it
stooped
peered
then
uttered
a
yell
what
is
it
they
cried
hurrying
up
you
done
it
now
chunky
brown
you
certainly
have
gone
and
done
it
what
what
is
it
cried
the
others
in
alarm
you
shot
the
lazy
mexican
burro
that
your
indian
stacy
brown
juan
who
had
followed
them
out
on
the
plain
uttered
a
wail
and
threw
himself
upon
the
body
of
his
prostrate
burro
the
animal
it
seemed
had
recovered
consciousness
during
the
night
and
in
a
condition
had
wandered
out
on
the
plain
stacy
while
crouching
down
on
the
ground
had
seen
the
head
and
long
ears
of
the
burro
he
thought
the
ears
were
part
of
the
head
dress
of
a
savage
and
let
fly
a
volley
of
bullets
at
it
he
he
is
dead
shouted
the
fat
boy
see
i
just
pinked
him
in
the
ears
and
surely
enough
an
examination
revealed
a
hole
through
each
ear
the
holes
were
so
close
to
the
animal
head
that
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
the
shot
had
stunned
him
being
already
in
a
weakened
condition
from
the
sleepy
grass
the
boys
set
to
work
to
rouse
the
burro
which
they
succeeded
in
doing
in
a
short
time
juan
with
arm
around
the
lazy
beast
neck
led
it
back
to
camp
petting
and
soothing
it
with
a
chattering
that
they
could
not
understand
there
was
no
more
sleep
in
camp
that
night
though
the
boys
turned
in
at
the
professor
suggestion
every
little
while
laughter
would
sound
in
one
of
the
tents
as
the
others
fell
to
discussing
indian
attack
the
next
morning
they
were
overjoyed
to
find
that
the
ponies
had
awakened
and
were
trying
to
get
up
lead
them
out
of
that
grass
fellows
shouted
tad
the
moment
he
saw
the
ponies
were
coming
around
we
do
want
them
to
make
another
meal
of
that
stuff
nor
take
another
of
chunky
rip
van
winkle
sleeps
added
ned
never
having
had
a
like
experience
none
of
the
lads
knew
what
to
do
with
their
mounts
after
getting
them
sufficiently
awake
to
lead
them
to
a
place
of
safety
they
appealed
to
juan
for
advice
but
the
lazy
mexican
appeared
to
know
even
less
than
they
tad
after
studying
the
question
a
few
moments
decided
to
give
them
water
though
sparingly
this
they
appeared
to
relish
and
braced
up
quite
a
little
but
the
boy
would
not
allow
them
to
graze
until
nearly
noon
when
each
one
took
his
pony
out
making
sure
that
there
was
none
of
the
sleepy
grass
around
the
animals
were
then
permitted
to
graze
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
tad
decided
that
all
were
fit
to
continue
the
journey
and
that
it
would
be
safe
to
travel
until
sunset
everyone
was
glad
to
get
away
from
the
spot
where
they
had
had
such
unpleasant
experiences
and
the
boys
set
off
moving
slowly
the
stock
not
yet
being
in
the
best
of
condition
late
in
the
afternoon
when
they
had
about
decided
to
make
camp
one
of
the
boys
espied
an
object
something
like
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
that
looked
like
the
roof
of
a
house
ned
said
it
could
be
that
as
it
appeared
to
be
resting
on
the
ground
they
asked
juan
if
he
knew
what
it
was
and
for
a
wonder
he
did
he
said
it
was
a
a
place
where
a
man
lived
is
he
a
hermit
asked
stacy
apprehensively
at
which
there
was
a
laugh
stacy
had
not
forgotten
his
experiences
in
the
cave
of
the
hermit
of
the
nevada
desert
for
the
next
hour
the
lads
were
too
busy
pitching
tents
and
unloading
the
pack
animals
to
give
further
thought
to
the
or
its
occupant
but
when
after
they
had
prepared
their
evening
meal
they
saw
some
one
approaching
on
horseback
they
were
instantly
curious
again
the
newcomer
proved
to
be
the
owner
of
the
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
short
cropped
beard
and
small
blue
twinkling
eyes
will
you
join
us
and
have
some
supper
asked
tad
politely
walking
out
to
greet
the
stranger
thank
you
i
will
young
man
smiled
the
stranger
tad
introduced
himself
and
companions
you
probably
have
heard
my
name
before
young
men
it
is
kris
kringle
i
living
out
here
for
my
health
and
doing
a
little
ranching
on
the
side
stacy
looked
his
amazement
is
is
he
santa
claus
he
whispered
tugging
at
tad
coat
sleeve
no
young
man
i
am
not
related
to
the
gentleman
you
refer
to
grinned
kringle
there
was
a
general
laugh
at
stacy
expense
after
supper
the
visitor
invited
all
hands
to
ride
over
to
his
and
spend
the
evening
with
him
the
boys
accepted
gladly
never
having
seen
the
inside
of
a
and
not
knowing
what
one
looked
like
professor
zepplin
had
taken
a
sudden
liking
to
the
man
with
the
christmas
name
and
soon
the
two
were
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
the
distance
being
so
short
tad
decided
that
they
had
better
walk
leaving
the
ponies
in
charge
of
juan
so
they
might
get
a
full
rest
then
all
hands
set
out
for
the
a
short
flight
of
steps
led
down
into
the
place
the
roof
of
which
was
raised
just
far
enough
above
the
ground
to
permit
of
two
narrow
windows
on
each
side
and
at
the
rear
end
the
room
in
which
they
found
themselves
proved
to
be
a
combination
kitchen
and
dining
room
its
neatness
and
orderliness
impressed
them
at
once
and
here
said
kris
kringle
is
what
i
call
my
den
throwing
open
a
door
leading
into
a
rear
room
and
lighting
a
hanging
oil
lamp
the
pony
rider
boys
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprised
delight
on
a
hardwood
floor
lay
a
profusion
of
brightly
colored
navajo
rugs
the
walls
being
hung
with
others
of
exquisite
workmanship
and
coloring
interspersed
with
weapons
and
trophies
of
the
chase
while
in
other
parts
of
the
room
were
rare
specimens
of
pottery
from
ancient
adobe
houses
of
the
pueblos
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
was
a
great
book
cases
stood
about
the
room
full
of
books
the
professor
realized
at
once
that
they
were
in
the
home
of
a
student
and
a
collector
this
is
indeed
an
oasis
in
the
desert
he
glowed
i
shall
be
loath
to
leave
here
then
do
smiled
kringle
i
sure
i
am
glad
enough
to
have
company
seldom
ever
see
anyone
here
except
now
and
then
a
roving
band
of
indians
indians
exclaimed
tad
do
you
have
any
trouble
with
them
well
they
know
better
than
to
bother
with
me
much
we
have
had
an
occasional
argument
said
their
host
his
jaws
setting
almost
stubbornly
for
the
instant
most
of
the
tribes
in
the
state
are
peaceful
though
the
apaches
are
as
bad
as
ever
they
behave
themselves
because
they
have
to
not
because
they
wish
to
do
so
i
saw
their
fire
dance
the
other
night
began
tad
what
demanded
kringle
fire
dance
tell
me
about
it
tad
did
so
the
host
listening
with
grave
face
until
the
recital
was
ended
he
shook
his
head
disapprovingly
and
this
this
indian
that
you
knocked
down
was
he
an
apache
i
do
know
i
think
so
though
he
had
on
a
peculiar
head
dress
that
was
one
of
them
interrupted
kringle
with
emphasis
and
i
wager
you
have
heard
the
last
of
him
yet
that
an
insult
which
the
apache
brave
will
harbor
under
his
copper
skin
forever
he
wait
for
years
but
he
get
even
if
he
can
the
faces
of
the
pony
rider
boys
were
grave
have
you
a
reliable
guide
far
from
it
answered
the
professor
if
i
knew
where
i
could
get
another
i
pack
him
off
without
ceremony
kris
kringle
was
silent
for
a
moment
i
need
a
little
change
of
scene
he
smiled
how
would
you
like
to
have
me
take
the
trail
with
you
for
a
week
or
so
would
you
glowed
the
professor
half
rising
from
his
chair
i
think
i
might
hurrah
cried
the
pony
riders
enthusiastically
that
will
be
fine
of
course
you
understand
that
i
expect
no
pay
i
am
going
because
i
happen
to
take
a
notion
to
do
so
perhaps
i
be
able
to
serve
you
at
the
same
time
the
professor
grasped
kringle
by
the
hand
impulsively
i
send
that
lazy
juan
on
his
way
this
very
night
let
me
do
it
interposed
stacy
with
flushing
face
i
do
it
right
professor
but
i
put
on
my
pair
of
heavy
boots
first
so
it
hurt
him
more
the
boys
shouted
with
laughter
while
the
new
guide
eyes
twinkled
merrily
i
think
perhaps
the
young
man
might
do
it
even
more
effectively
than
you
or
i
he
said
have
you
weapons
professor
rifles
that
good
we
may
need
them
then
you
think
one
can
never
tell
chapter
xi
riding
with
kris
kringle
a
slender
ribbon
of
dust
unrolling
across
the
plain
far
to
the
northward
marked
the
receding
trail
of
juan
and
his
lazy
burro
they
had
given
him
a
week
extra
pay
and
sent
him
on
his
way
the
burro
was
making
for
home
aided
by
the
busy
feet
of
its
master
while
stacy
brown
shading
his
eyes
with
one
hand
was
watching
the
progress
of
the
guide
whom
he
had
just
sent
adrift
well
he
gone
grinned
stacy
turning
to
his
companions
who
were
busy
striking
camp
and
a
good
riddance
nodded
tad
he
probably
join
the
indians
and
tell
them
where
we
are
suggested
walter
i
had
thought
of
that
replied
tad
still
if
they
wish
to
find
us
they
know
how
without
juan
telling
them
how
they
can
follow
a
trail
with
their
eyes
shut
said
ned
that
right
they
do
not
need
to
be
told
muttered
tad
everything
being
in
readiness
the
boys
started
with
their
outfit
for
the
where
they
were
to
be
joined
by
kris
kringle
they
felt
a
real
relief
to
know
that
they
were
to
have
with
them
a
strong
man
on
whom
they
were
sure
they
could
rely
to
do
the
right
thing
under
all
circumstances
tad
however
believed
that
kringle
had
decided
to
join
them
fearing
they
would
be
attacked
by
the
apaches
and
come
to
serious
harm
yet
he
hardly
thought
the
redskins
would
dare
to
follow
them
after
the
latter
had
once
gotten
over
the
frenzy
of
their
fire
dance
by
that
time
the
indian
agents
would
have
rounded
them
all
up
on
the
reservations
where
the
indians
would
be
able
to
do
no
more
harm
for
a
while
after
picking
up
the
new
guide
the
start
was
made
the
party
had
water
in
plenty
in
the
so
that
no
effort
was
made
to
pick
up
a
water
hole
when
they
made
camp
late
in
the
afternoon
the
guide
had
brought
in
his
pack
a
tough
old
sage
hen
at
which
the
lads
were
inclined
to
jeer
when
he
announced
his
intention
of
cooking
it
for
their
supper
you
change
your
mind
when
you
taste
it
young
gentlemen
it
depends
upon
the
cooking
entirely
a
sage
hen
may
be
a
delicious
morsel
or
it
may
not
answered
kringle
with
a
grin
they
were
encamped
near
a
succession
of
buttes
and
to
while
away
the
time
until
the
supper
hour
the
boys
strolled
away
singly
to
stretch
their
legs
on
the
plain
after
the
long
day
ride
in
the
hot
sun
when
they
returned
an
hour
or
so
later
stacy
they
observed
was
swinging
a
curious
forked
stick
that
he
had
picked
up
somewhere
a
few
moments
ago
what
you
got
there
questioned
ned
do
know
picked
it
up
on
the
plain
such
a
funny
looking
thing
that
i
brought
it
along
let
me
see
it
asked
kringle
stacy
handed
it
to
him
this
said
the
guide
turning
the
stick
over
in
his
hand
is
a
divining
rod
divining
rod
demanded
stacy
pressing
forward
yes
never
heard
of
it
is
it
good
to
eat
looks
to
me
like
a
wish
bone
interjected
ned
do
you
eat
wish
bones
chunky
might
if
i
were
hungry
enough
a
divining
rod
is
used
to
locate
springs
some
users
of
it
have
been
very
successful
i
could
find
a
lake
with
it
even
if
i
fell
in
first
indeed
marveled
the
professor
i
have
heard
of
the
remarkable
work
of
divining
rods
what
rind
of
wood
is
it
this
is
hazel
wood
oak
elm
ash
or
privet
also
are
used
but
hazel
is
preferred
in
this
country
then
then
we
wo
have
to
go
dry
any
more
i
can
find
water
with
this
when
i
dry
questioned
stacy
you
might
then
again
you
might
not
better
take
it
away
from
him
suggested
ned
he
might
find
a
spring
if
he
did
he
be
sure
to
fall
in
and
drown
the
stick
which
was
shaped
like
the
letter
y
was
an
object
of
great
interest
to
the
pony
rider
boys
one
by
one
they
took
it
out
on
the
plain
in
an
effort
to
locate
some
water
the
guide
instructed
them
to
hold
the
y
with
the
bottom
up
one
prong
in
each
hand
and
to
walk
slowly
but
try
as
they
would
they
were
able
to
get
no
results
the
thing
a
fraud
exclaimed
ned
disgustedly
throwing
the
divining
rod
away
stacy
picked
it
up
i
know
why
it
does
work
he
said
why
demanded
the
other
boys
there
is
any
water
to
make
it
work
he
replied
wisely
the
boys
groaned
shortly
after
returning
to
camp
they
found
the
fat
boy
standing
over
a
pail
of
water
holding
the
stick
above
it
he
was
talking
to
the
stick
confidentially
urging
it
to
do
something
to
the
intense
amusement
of
the
whole
outfit
now
where
your
theory
questioned
the
professor
why
it
does
have
to
work
does
it
do
we
know
there
water
here
if
we
did
the
stick
would
tell
us
maybe
take
my
word
for
it
this
outfit
wo
have
to
go
dry
after
this
stacy
brown
and
his
magic
wand
will
find
all
the
water
needed
continued
the
fat
boy
proudly
your
logic
is
good
at
any
rate
even
if
the
rod
does
work
at
command
laughed
the
professor
supper
was
a
jolly
affair
for
everyone
was
in
high
spirits
the
sage
hen
contrary
to
general
expectation
was
found
to
be
delicious
chunky
begged
for
the
wish
bone
and
got
it
he
said
he
use
it
for
a
divining
rod
when
he
wanted
to
find
a
little
spring
kringle
i
am
commissioned
by
the
fellows
to
ask
you
a
question
announced
tad
after
the
meal
had
been
in
progress
for
a
time
ask
it
smiled
the
guide
we
thought
we
like
to
call
you
santa
claus
seeing
you
brought
us
so
much
cheer
then
again
it
your
name
you
know
kris
kringle
is
santa
claus
oh
well
call
me
what
you
please
young
men
from
that
moment
on
kris
kringle
was
santa
claus
to
the
pony
rider
boys
they
had
now
come
to
a
rolling
country
with
here
and
there
high
buttes
followed
by
large
areas
of
bottom
lands
which
were
covered
with
rank
growths
of
bunch
grass
traveling
was
more
difficult
than
it
had
been
and
water
more
scarce
it
was
on
the
second
day
out
after
they
had
been
skirmishing
for
water
in
every
direction
that
the
lads
heard
the
familiar
yell
from
chunky
there
goes
the
trouble
maker
cried
ned
he
at
it
again
the
guide
bounded
up
starting
on
a
run
for
the
spot
where
wail
had
been
heard
the
others
were
not
far
behind
they
saw
the
red
perspiring
face
of
the
fat
boy
above
a
clump
of
grass
his
yells
for
help
continuing
unabated
what
is
it
shouted
the
guide
i
got
it
santa
claus
i
got
it
got
what
roared
the
professor
the
stick
i
mean
it
got
me
help
help
stacy
was
wrestling
about
as
if
engaged
in
combat
with
some
enemy
they
could
not
imagine
what
had
gone
wrong
what
had
caused
his
sudden
cries
of
alarm
it
the
divining
rod
called
the
guide
he
found
water
shouted
the
boys
i
got
it
i
got
it
come
help
me
hold
it
the
thing
jerking
my
arms
off
to
the
amazement
of
the
pony
rider
boys
the
forked
stick
in
the
hands
of
the
fat
boy
was
performing
some
strange
antics
breathing
hard
he
would
force
it
up
until
it
was
nearly
upright
when
all
at
once
the
point
of
the
triangle
would
suddenly
swerve
downward
bending
the
rod
almost
to
the
breaking
point
see
it
see
it
most
remarkable
breathed
professor
zepplin
yes
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
nodded
the
guide
he
bluffing
disagreed
ned
does
look
to
me
as
if
he
were
returned
tad
take
hold
with
me
here
if
you
do
believe
me
cried
stacy
no
not
on
the
stick
take
hold
of
my
wrists
ned
promptly
accepted
the
invitation
instantly
the
tug
of
the
divining
rod
was
felt
by
the
new
hands
ned
let
go
quickly
ugh
the
thing
gives
me
the
creeps
let
me
try
it
master
stacy
said
professor
zepplin
i
ca
let
go
of
it
wailed
chunky
step
off
a
piece
directed
the
guide
stacy
did
so
whereupon
the
divining
rod
immediately
ceased
its
peculiar
actions
the
professor
took
hold
of
it
but
the
rod
refused
to
work
for
him
let
santa
claus
try
it
suggested
ned
the
guide
did
so
but
with
no
more
success
than
the
professor
had
had
i
told
you
it
would
work
for
me
kringle
grinned
here
master
tad
you
try
it
tad
with
the
rod
grasped
firmly
in
his
hands
walked
back
and
forth
three
times
without
result
on
the
fourth
attempt
however
the
stick
suddenly
bent
nearly
double
all
were
amazed
why
were
we
unable
to
get
results
mr
kringle
questioned
the
professor
according
to
some
french
writers
as
much
depends
upon
the
man
as
on
the
divining
rod
where
one
succeeds
another
fails
absolutely
supposing
the
others
take
a
try
walter
and
ned
did
so
but
neither
could
get
the
rod
to
move
for
him
i
guess
chunky
is
the
champion
laughed
ned
would
it
not
be
a
good
idea
to
find
out
whether
or
not
there
is
water
here
asked
the
professor
yes
agreed
the
guide
it
may
be
so
far
down
that
we
can
not
reach
it
however
you
know
in
some
parts
of
this
region
they
are
locating
water
with
the
rod
and
sinking
artesian
wells
why
why
did
we
think
to
bring
some
down
with
us
demanded
chunky
ca
we
get
any
in
some
of
the
towns
down
here
some
what
questioned
the
guide
artesian
wells
a
roar
greeted
the
fat
boy
question
bring
down
a
load
of
artesian
wells
jeered
ned
an
artesian
well
my
boy
is
nothing
more
than
a
hole
in
the
ground
the
guide
informed
him
much
to
chunky
chagrin
the
spot
where
the
divining
rod
had
so
suddenly
gotten
busy
was
about
midway
of
an
old
water
course
covered
with
a
thick
growth
of
bunch
grass
get
some
tools
boys
directed
the
professor
tad
ran
back
to
camp
which
lay
some
distance
to
the
east
of
where
they
were
gathered
searching
out
a
pick
and
two
shovels
he
leaped
on
his
pony
dashing
back
to
the
arroyo
that
was
quickly
done
smiled
santa
claus
are
all
of
you
lads
as
quick
on
an
errand
as
that
only
chunky
answered
ned
solemnly
the
guide
began
to
dig
in
which
effort
he
was
joined
by
stacy
brown
who
with
a
shovel
caved
in
about
as
much
dirt
as
he
threw
out
here
give
me
that
shovel
commanded
ned
you
fill
up
the
bole
before
we
get
it
dug
tad
having
tethered
his
pony
took
the
extra
shovel
and
went
to
work
guess
it
a
false
alarm
decided
ned
after
they
were
up
to
their
shoulders
in
the
hole
do
be
too
sure
the
ground
is
quite
damp
here
try
your
rod
young
man
chunky
held
the
divining
rod
over
the
excavation
whereupon
it
drew
down
with
even
greater
force
than
before
dig
directed
the
guide
they
did
so
with
a
will
here
water
shouted
kris
kringle
they
crowded
about
the
hole
amazement
written
on
every
face
a
fresh
cool
stream
bubbled
up
into
the
hole
causing
those
in
the
pit
to
scramble
out
hastily
some
of
you
boys
run
back
to
camp
and
fetch
pails
and
directed
the
guide
i
go
i
got
the
pony
here
spoke
up
tad
no
i
want
you
to
do
something
else
for
me
we
all
go
offered
walter
the
three
lads
started
on
a
run
chunky
holding
his
precious
divining
rod
tightly
clasped
in
both
hands
what
is
it
you
wish
questioned
tad
i
wish
you
would
ride
over
toward
that
small
butte
and
cut
a
load
of
brush
want
to
the
outer
edge
of
this
water
hole
so
the
bank
will
not
cave
in
and
undo
all
our
work
have
you
a
hatchet
yes
in
my
saddlebags
good
hurry
please
tad
leaped
into
the
saddle
and
putting
spurs
to
his
broncho
tore
through
the
high
bunch
grass
above
which
only
his
head
was
now
observable
in
a
short
time
he
was
back
with
the
green
stuff
piled
high
on
the
saddle
in
front
of
him
with
a
large
bundle
tied
to
the
cantle
of
the
saddle
behind
unloading
this
butler
started
back
at
a
gallop
for
more
when
there
was
work
to
be
done
tad
butler
was
happy
activity
to
him
was
a
tonic
that
spurred
him
on
to
ever
greater
efforts
this
time
he
found
himself
obliged
to
climb
higher
up
the
butte
in
order
to
get
branches
of
available
size
these
he
cut
and
threw
down
after
having
procured
what
he
thought
would
be
all
he
could
carry
the
lad
scrambled
down
and
dropping
on
his
knees
began
tying
them
into
bundles
the
heat
was
sweltering
and
occasionally
be
paused
to
wipe
away
the
perspiration
i
smell
smoke
sniffed
tad
i
wonder
where
it
comes
from
the
odor
grew
stronger
but
so
interested
was
he
in
his
labor
that
he
did
not
at
once
understand
the
significance
of
his
discovery
it
was
a
warning
shout
it
a
signal
exclaimed
the
lad
straightening
up
i
wonder
the
matter
as
he
looked
toward
the
camp
a
great
wall
of
flame
seemed
to
leap
from
the
ground
between
him
and
his
companions
there
it
poised
for
one
brief
instant
then
with
a
roar
swooped
down
into
the
tall
bunch
grass
rushing
roaring
and
crackling
toward
him
for
an
instant
he
stood
unbelieving
then
the
truth
dawned
upon
him
the
prairie
on
fire
cried
tad
chapter
xii
the
dash
for
life
the
shouts
of
the
pony
rider
boys
and
of
the
guide
were
swallowed
up
in
the
roar
of
the
flames
they
be
burned
alive
whispered
the
lad
then
all
at
once
he
realized
that
he
himself
was
in
dire
peril
i
have
to
go
the
other
way
and
be
quick
about
it
at
that
he
decided
making
a
dash
for
the
pony
that
already
was
whinnying
with
fear
and
tugging
at
its
tether
tad
did
not
wait
to
untie
the
stake
rope
with
a
sweep
of
his
knife
he
severed
it
and
vaulted
into
the
saddle
whirling
the
animal
about
he
headed
to
the
west
to
his
alarm
he
suddenly
discovered
that
the
prairie
fire
was
rapidly
encircling
him
the
flames
running
around
the
outer
edge
of
the
bottoms
with
express
train
speed
threatening
to
head
him
off
and
envelop
him
had
it
not
been
for
the
long
grass
which
tangling
the
feet
of
the
pony
made
full
speed
impossible
the
race
with
the
flames
would
have
been
an
easy
one
to
win
as
it
was
tad
knew
that
the
chances
were
against
him
but
the
dire
peril
in
which
he
found
himself
did
not
daunt
the
pony
rider
boy
perhaps
his
face
had
grown
a
shade
paler
underneath
the
tan
but
that
was
all
his
senses
were
on
the
alert
his
lips
met
in
a
firm
pressure
and
the
hand
gripped
the
bridle
rein
a
little
more
firmly
perhaps
than
usual
uttering
a
shrill
cry
to
inform
his
companions
that
he
was
alive
to
his
peril
and
at
the
same
time
to
encourage
the
broncho
tad
dug
in
the
rowels
of
his
spurs
the
frightened
pony
cleared
the
ground
with
all
four
feet
uttering
a
squeal
and
launching
itself
at
the
rapidly
narrowing
clear
space
ahead
of
him
and
urged
to
greater
and
greater
endeavor
at
every
leap
by
the
short
sharp
yips
of
his
rider
for
all
the
concern
that
showed
in
his
face
tad
butler
might
have
been
running
a
horse
race
for
a
prize
rather
than
fleeing
for
his
life
if
i
make
it
i
lucky
commented
tad
grimly
he
found
himself
wondering
at
the
same
time
how
the
fire
had
started
he
knew
that
the
flames
first
showed
themselves
midway
between
where
he
was
at
work
and
the
place
where
his
companions
were
engaged
at
the
water
hole
he
could
not
understand
it
fire
was
necessary
to
use
to
start
fire
and
he
knew
that
none
of
them
had
been
foolish
enough
even
to
light
a
match
in
the
dry
bunch
grass
of
the
prairie
the
flames
were
reaching
mountain
high
by
this
time
great
clouds
of
smoke
rolling
in
on
the
breeze
and
nearly
suffocating
him
at
times
tad
was
unable
to
see
the
opening
ahead
of
him
when
however
the
smoke
lifted
giving
him
a
momentary
view
he
saw
that
the
gap
was
rapidly
closing
all
at
once
his
attention
was
drawn
from
the
closing
gap
yeow
yeow
yeow
a
series
of
shrill
blood
curdling
yells
from
out
the
pall
of
smoke
and
flame
at
the
rear
bombarded
his
ears
at
first
he
thought
it
was
indians
then
the
improbability
of
this
being
the
case
came
to
him
yeow
yeow
yeow
persisted
the
voice
behind
and
it
was
coming
nearer
every
second
tad
slackened
the
speed
of
his
pony
ever
so
little
despite
the
peril
of
his
position
there
somebody
in
there
behind
me
and
he
never
get
out
alive
if
he
loses
his
way
the
moment
this
thought
occurred
to
him
tad
began
to
yell
at
the
top
of
his
voice
suddenly
from
out
the
thick
veil
of
smoke
burst
a
pony
with
a
mighty
snort
coming
on
in
bounds
each
one
of
which
cleared
many
feet
of
ground
on
the
pony
back
was
stacy
brown
hatless
coatless
his
hair
standing
up
in
the
breeze
his
face
as
red
as
if
it
had
come
in
actual
contact
with
the
flames
yeow
he
roared
as
his
pony
shot
past
tad
as
if
the
latter
mount
were
standing
still
where
stacy
had
come
from
how
he
had
passed
through
that
wall
of
flame
tad
had
not
the
slightest
idea
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
explanation
was
simple
enough
the
guide
had
sent
chunky
out
to
assist
tad
in
bringing
in
the
material
stacy
had
made
a
detour
from
the
camp
having
gotten
just
inside
the
danger
zone
when
the
fire
broke
out
guided
by
the
butte
where
he
knew
his
companion
must
be
stacy
headed
for
that
point
there
he
came
upon
tad
trail
and
began
yelling
to
attract
his
attention
he
had
heard
tad
answering
cry
and
this
inspired
the
fat
boy
to
renewed
efforts
stacy
now
that
he
had
passed
tad
slowed
up
ever
so
little
he
had
passed
his
companion
so
swiftly
that
he
was
unable
to
determine
whether
or
not
tad
were
in
distress
the
latter
came
up
overhauling
stacy
in
a
few
moments
both
ponies
were
steaming
from
the
terrific
gruelling
they
were
giving
themselves
what
you
doing
here
exploded
tad
same
thing
you
are
what
do
you
mean
trying
to
save
myself
from
being
burned
alive
do
slow
up
do
slow
up
shouted
tad
keep
going
i
am
wat
matter
with
you
i
do
see
what
you
had
to
come
tumbling
into
this
mess
for
objected
tad
did
tumble
in
rode
in
came
to
help
you
precious
lot
of
help
you
be
to
me
lucky
if
we
not
both
burned
with
our
boots
on
see
the
flame
narrowing
in
on
us
more
steam
chunky
more
steam
urged
tad
ca
blow
up
the
boiler
if
i
do
stacy
could
not
be
other
than
humorous
even
under
their
present
trying
situation
that
better
than
burning
out
your
fires
and
it
quicker
too
all
at
once
chunky
uttered
a
terrible
howl
his
pony
had
stepped
into
a
hole
and
gone
down
floundering
in
the
long
grass
chunky
himself
having
been
hurled
over
the
animal
head
landing
several
feet
in
advance
help
help
the
rest
was
lost
as
the
fat
boy
face
plowed
the
earth
filling
mouth
eyes
and
nostrils
tad
did
not
lose
his
presence
of
mind
though
events
had
been
following
each
other
in
such
quick
succession
changing
the
reins
to
his
right
hand
and
bunching
them
there
he
grasped
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
driving
his
own
pony
straight
at
the
kicking
floundering
chunky
the
pony
swerved
ever
so
little
tad
body
swept
down
and
when
it
rose
his
fingers
were
fastened
in
the
shirt
collar
of
his
companion
with
chunky
yelling
and
choking
as
he
was
being
dragged
over
the
ground
at
almost
a
killing
pace
tad
had
no
time
to
do
more
than
hold
on
to
his
friend
he
dared
not
stop
to
lift
him
to
the
saddle
just
then
the
flames
were
roaring
behind
them
and
on
either
side
leaving
a
long
narrow
lane
ahead
through
which
lay
their
only
hope
of
safety
buck
up
buck
up
chunky
shouted
tad
himself
taking
a
fresh
brace
in
the
stirrups
for
the
weight
of
the
fat
boy
dragging
body
was
slowly
pulling
tad
from
the
saddle
stacy
was
howling
like
an
indian
not
from
fear
but
from
anger
at
the
rough
usage
to
which
he
was
being
subjected
he
did
not
stop
to
think
that
it
was
the
only
way
his
life
might
be
saved
nor
that
his
own
pony
lay
back
there
in
the
bunch
grass
amid
the
flame
and
smoke
tad
knew
it
now
by
a
mighty
effort
tad
righted
himself
again
and
leaning
forward
threw
one
arm
about
the
pony
neck
trusting
to
the
animal
to
follow
the
outward
trail
to
safety
of
its
own
accord
tad
felt
a
sudden
jolt
that
nearly
caused
him
to
slide
from
his
pony
on
the
side
opposite
chunky
at
the
same
time
the
strain
on
the
arm
was
suddenly
released
tad
was
up
on
his
saddle
like
a
flash
his
right
hand
held
the
fat
boy
shirt
while
a
series
of
howls
to
the
rear
told
him
where
the
owner
of
the
shirt
lay
tad
groaned
pulling
his
pony
fairly
back
on
its
haunches
he
dashed
back
where
stacy
lay
kicking
entangling
himself
deeper
and
deeper
in
the
bunch
grass
had
tad
not
had
presence
of
mind
they
both
might
have
perished
right
there
he
was
off
like
a
flash
with
supreme
strength
he
grasped
the
body
of
his
fallen
companion
raising
him
into
the
saddle
hold
on
he
shouted
do
you
dare
fall
off
stacy
clung
like
a
monkey
to
a
pony
in
a
circus
race
trilled
tad
he
had
no
time
to
mount
already
he
could
feel
the
hot
breath
of
the
flames
on
his
cheek
the
broncho
was
off
with
a
bound
tad
tad
cried
chunky
in
sudden
alarm
now
realizing
that
he
was
alone
whe
where
are
you
to
the
wow
howled
stacy
as
turning
in
the
saddle
he
discovered
his
companion
being
fairly
jerked
through
the
air
holding
fast
to
the
pony
tail
the
lad
feet
hardly
touching
the
ground
at
all
the
broncho
that
ordinarily
would
have
resented
such
treatment
too
fully
occupied
in
saving
his
own
life
from
the
flames
gave
no
heed
to
the
weight
he
was
dragging
and
it
is
doubtful
if
he
even
realized
there
was
any
additional
weight
there
with
a
final
desperate
leap
the
broncho
shot
out
ahead
of
the
narrowing
lane
like
the
jaws
of
some
great
monster
the
two
lapping
lines
of
fire
closed
in
behind
them
roaring
as
if
with
deadly
rage
the
pony
dashed
out
into
a
broad
open
water
course
whose
dry
glistening
sands
would
prove
an
effectual
barrier
to
the
prairie
fire
tad
though
everything
was
swimming
before
his
eyes
realized
quickly
that
they
were
now
well
out
of
danger
him
i
let
go
if
you
whoa
whoa
do
you
know
enough
to
quit
when
you
through
chided
chunky
tugging
at
the
reins
the
broncho
carried
them
some
distance
before
the
lad
was
able
to
pull
him
down
finally
he
did
so
leggo
he
shouted
at
the
same
time
whirling
the
pony
sharply
about
fairly
cracking
the
whip
with
tad
butler
chunky
clever
foresight
probably
saved
tad
butler
life
for
instantly
the
pony
found
itself
free
it
began
bucking
and
kicking
in
a
circle
kicking
a
ring
all
round
the
compass
before
it
finally
decided
to
settle
down
on
all
fours
finishing
it
meekly
lowered
its
nose
to
the
ground
and
now
as
docile
as
a
kitten
after
having
supped
on
warm
milk
began
dozing
the
steam
rising
in
a
cloud
from
its
sides
well
of
all
the
fool
fools
you
the
champion
fool
growled
stacy
slipping
from
the
saddle
and
surveying
the
broncho
with
disapproving
eyes
hah
i
guess
we
been
done
to
a
turn
by
this
if
it
had
been
for
you
just
the
same
hello
tad
tad
had
doubled
up
in
a
heap
where
the
tail
of
the
broncho
had
flung
him
he
was
spent
but
he
smiled
back
at
his
companion
who
stood
on
a
slight
rise
of
ground
almost
a
heroic
figure
chunky
shirt
was
entirely
missing
his
skin
red
from
the
heat
ridged
with
scratches
where
he
had
come
in
violent
contact
with
cactus
plants
his
hair
tousled
and
gray
with
dust
well
you
are
a
sight
grinned
tad
you
would
take
a
prize
at
a
baby
show
yourself
retorted
stacy
spicily
tad
clothes
were
torn
and
his
limbs
were
black
and
blue
all
the
way
down
where
the
hoofs
of
the
broncho
had
raked
them
again
and
again
my
arms
feel
a
foot
longer
than
they
did
what
are
you
looking
at
stacy
eyes
grew
large
and
luminous
as
he
gazed
off
over
the
plains
look
look

he
whispered
chapter
xiii
following
a
hot
trail
fire
fire
cried
professor
zepplin
leaping
up
from
where
he
had
been
leaning
over
watching
the
water
bubbling
in
the
bottom
of
the
excavation
they
had
made
the
guide
had
been
hanging
over
the
hole
dipping
water
to
ned
who
was
turning
it
into
the
where
where
demanded
kringle
explosively
he
also
sprang
to
his
feet
it
a
prairie
fire
the
boys
are
caught
they
perish
exclaimed
professor
zepplin
with
blanching
face
go
to
them
go
to
them
mr
kringle
he
begged
no
living
thing
could
get
through
that
wall
of
fire
professor
announced
the
guide
impressively
we
shout
and
perhaps
if
alive
they
bear
us
they
did
so
with
the
result
already
known
which
direction
did
master
stacy
take
kringle
asked
i
saw
him
riding
down
that
way
replied
walter
pointing
excitedly
then
perhaps
he
is
safe
outside
of
the
fire
zone
some
of
you
hurry
back
to
the
camp
the
stock
may
take
fright
and
stampede
no
all
go
the
wind
may
shift
at
any
moment
and
while
i
do
not
think
the
flames
could
reach
the
camp
all
our
animals
might
be
suffocated
even
if
they
did
not
succeed
in
getting
away
but
you
not
going
to
desert
tad
and
chunky
are
you
demanded
walter
indignantly
certainly
not
what
can
we
do
here
we
must
get
the
ponies
first
then
we
hurry
to
them
i
afraid
they
been
caught
answered
the
guide
if
there
any
way
of
escape
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
master
tad
has
discovered
that
way
answered
the
professor
he
is
a
resourceful
boy
and
but
the
rest
were
already
dashing
madly
toward
the
camp
and
professor
zepplin
began
to
do
so
with
all
speed
to
catch
up
with
them
the
hot
breath
of
the
prairie
fire
had
brought
the
color
to
his
blanched
cheeks
how
how
do
you
think
the
fire
started
stammered
the
professor
when
he
at
last
came
up
with
the
guide
it
was
set
afire
answered
kris
kringle
grimly
set
shouted
the
professor
and
the
two
boys
all
in
one
breath
yes
by
whom
that
remains
to
be
seen
do
you
mean
that
one
of
the
boys
was
imprudent
enough
to
build
a
fire
in
that
grass
surely
they
would
not
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
do
a
thing
like
that
as
i
said
that
remains
to
be
seen
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
get
to
them
as
quickly
as
possible
though
i
do
know
that
we
can
do
any
good
they
either
out
of
it
by
this
time
or
else
not
added
kringle
suggestively
professor
i
wish
you
and
one
of
the
boys
would
get
out
your
rifles
mount
your
ponies
and
watch
the
camp
while
two
of
us
go
in
search
of
the
lost
ones
watch
the
camp
yes
for
what
reason
merely
as
a
precaution
i
attend
to
that
i
want
all
of
you
to
get
after
tad
and
stacy
we
do
care
about
the
camp
particularly
when
compared
with
two
human
lives
the
smoke
was
rolling
over
them
in
such
dense
clouds
that
the
camp
was
wholly
obscured
from
view
until
they
were
upon
it
quick
get
the
horses
before
they
break
away
commanded
the
guide
i
ca
find
them
shouted
ned
who
had
bounded
on
ahead
and
disappeared
in
the
great
suffocating
cloud
walter
was
only
a
few
steps
behind
him
both
boys
groping
blinking
and
coughing
as
the
smoke
got
into
eyes
and
lungs
lie
down
when
it
gets
stronger
than
you
can
stand
there
always
a
current
of
fresh
air
near
the
ground
called
the
guide
both
lads
adopted
his
suggestion
instantly
and
they
were
none
too
soon
for
already
they
were
getting
dizzy
after
a
few
long
breaths
they
were
up
groping
about
once
more
in
search
of
the
stock
over
to
you
right
called
the
professor
we
been
there
they
not
there
at
all
answered
ned
by
this
time
the
guide
had
dived
into
the
cloud
the
stock
has
gone
they
heard
him
shoat
have
they
stampeded
roared
the
professor
i
do
know
i
find
out
in
a
minute
queer
that
this
smoke
blows
two
ways
at
once
said
walter
there
is
a
slight
breeze
blowing
this
way
explained
ned
not
enough
however
to
turn
the
fire
back
it
has
got
too
good
a
start
suddenly
a
weird
sounded
to
the
right
of
them
what
that
it
the
guide
walt
he
trying
to
call
the
boys
to
see
if
they
are
alive
explained
ned
i
do
think
so
that
cry
is
for
some
other
purpose
i
going
over
where
he
is
to
find
out
what
it
does
mean
come
on
together
the
lads
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
in
the
direction
from
which
the
guide
voice
had
come
they
found
him
with
hands
shaped
into
a
megaphone
uttering
his
shrill
cries
he
made
no
answer
to
their
questions
as
to
what
he
was
trying
to
do
all
at
once
off
in
the
cloud
they
heard
rapid
hoofbeats
the
boys
glanced
at
each
other
in
surprise
it
the
ponies
returning
breathed
walter
perkins
ned
shook
his
head
the
cries
now
took
on
a
more
insistent
tone
and
a
moment
later
two
ponies
came
whinnying
into
the
camp
snorting
with
fear
kris
kringle
spoke
to
them
sharply
whereupon
they
came
trotting
up
to
him
with
every
evidence
of
pleasure
the
lads
were
amazed
can
you
boys
shoot
a
rope
yes
they
answered
together
which
one
is
the
better
at
it
ned
is
more
expert
than
i
am
take
one
of
my
ponies
we
got
to
go
after
the
stock
rope
and
bring
them
in
as
fast
as
possible
it
getting
late
and
it
will
be
dark
before
we
know
it
there
not
more
than
two
hours
of
daylight
left
i
can
take
my
pony
and
help
began
walter
you
have
any
pony
they
all
gone
ned
and
the
guide
dashed
from
the
camp
at
speed
emerging
from
the
dust
cloud
they
saw
some
of
the
stock
far
off
on
the
plain
there
they
are
cried
ned
thank
goodness
they
all
together
and
they
are
not
running
got
them
bunched
were
they
afraid
of
the
smoke
what
made
them
break
away
they
did
break
away
what
their
tethers
were
cut
and
they
were
sent
adrift
answered
the
guide
grimly
ned
was
speechless
with
surprise
some
of
the
ponies
objecting
to
being
roped
ran
away
necessitating
a
lively
chase
kris
kringle
worked
with
the
precision
of
an
automatic
gun
and
with
proportionate
speed
in
half
an
hour
they
had
roped
all
the
ponies
and
with
the
burros
trailing
along
behind
started
back
to
camp
as
rapidly
as
possible
a
heavy
pall
of
smoke
still
hung
over
the
camp
and
all
the
surrounding
country
once
more
they
staked
down
the
ponies
and
pack
animals
and
urging
vigilance
on
the
part
of
professor
zepplin
ned
and
the
guide
dashed
away
at
full
gallop
in
search
of
the
two
missing
lads
are
we
going
through
the
fire
questioned
ned
apprehensively
we
going
to
try
it
the
worst
of
it
must
have
passed
before
this
but
we
may
have
to
turn
back
or
turn
out
for
spots
it
the
shortest
way
and
the
only
course
to
follow
if
we
want
to
know
what
has
become
of
them
spreading
out
a
little
they
continued
on
their
way
the
ponies
snorting
threatening
to
whirl
about
and
race
back
into
the
open
plain
the
ground
was
like
a
furnace
and
the
grass
smouldered
beneath
them
heating
their
feet
and
singeing
their
fetlocks
suddenly
ned
pony
reared
into
the
air
bucked
and
hurled
its
rider
far
over
into
the
smouldering
bunch
grass
ned
uttered
a
yell
of
warning
as
he
felt
himself
going
the
guide
wheeled
like
a
flash
ned
mount
had
whirled
and
was
away
like
a
shot
but
the
guide
was
after
him
with
even
greater
speed
the
chase
came
to
an
abrupt
ending
some
few
rods
farther
on
when
kris
kringle
lariat
squirmed
out
bringing
the
fleeing
pony
to
the
ground
with
its
nose
in
the
hot
dust
without
dismounting
the
guide
turned
his
own
mount
and
fairly
dragging
the
unwilling
pony
behind
him
pounded
back
to
the
place
where
ned
had
been
unhorsed
grab
him
commanded
the
guide
to
ned
who
had
quickly
scrambled
to
his
feet
what
was
it
that
he
saw
i
do
know
guess
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
back
no
he
saw
something
hang
on
to
him
and
cover
the
ground
all
about
you
till
you
find
it
wha
what
do
you
never
mind
look
here
here
it
is
cried
ned
aghast
the
guide
was
at
his
side
instantly
it
a
pony
gasped
the
pony
rider
boy
kris
kringle
was
off
his
own
mount
instantly
and
bidding
ned
hold
the
animal
he
made
a
brief
examination
of
the
fallen
horse
after
which
he
darted
here
and
there
unheeding
the
fact
that
the
still
burning
grass
was
blistering
his
feet
through
the
heavy
soles
of
his
boots
for
several
rods
kringle
ran
along
the
faint
trail
that
tad
and
stacy
had
left
or
rather
that
the
fire
had
left
after
passing
over
it
they
beat
their
way
out
here
we
may
find
them
later
come
on
again
ned
and
the
guide
dashed
away
both
keeping
their
gaze
on
the
smoking
prairie
about
them
the
smoke
now
was
almost
more
than
they
could
bear
do
do
you
think
they
are
alive
asked
ned
unsteadily
so
far
if
they
are
not
it
not
their
fault
the
professor
is
right
those
boys
have
pluck
enough
to
pull
them
through
but
sometimes
pluck
alone
will
not
do
it
a
prairie
fire
is
no
respecter
of
pluck
they
burst
out
into
an
open
space
there
were
no
signs
of
either
of
the
missing
boys
something
has
happened
to
them
we
must
have
missed
them
announced
the
guide
chapter
xiv
against
big
odds
what
is
it
chunky
there
tad
jerked
his
companion
flat
on
the
ground
flattening
himself
beside
stacy
at
the
same
instant
what
had
caused
their
sudden
alarm
was
the
sight
of
two
indians
sitting
on
their
ponies
without
saddles
some
distance
out
on
the
open
plain
the
redskins
were
wrapped
in
their
brightly
colored
blankets
which
enveloped
them
from
head
to
knees
even
the
hands
were
invisible
beneath
the
folds
of
the
blankets
you
think
they
saw
us
tad
i
do
know
it
safe
to
say
they
did
indian
eyes
do
miss
very
much
you
ought
to
know
that
by
this
time
i
wish
we
could
make
that
pony
lie
down
why
do
you
he
too
afraid
of
the
ground
thinks
it
still
hot
and
i
blame
him
the
fire
has
singed
him
pretty
well
as
it
is
the
indians
sat
their
mounts
as
motionless
as
statues
the
ponies
headed
directly
toward
where
the
two
lads
were
lying
i
bet
they
got
guns
under
those
blankets
decided
tad
you
ca
trust
an
indian
even
while
you
are
looking
at
him
anybody
think
you
been
hunting
indians
all
your
life
growled
stacy
they
been
hunting
me
mostly
grinned
tad
and
usually
caught
you
added
chunky
i
do
like
this
lying
here
as
if
we
were
scared
of
them
but
what
else
can
we
do
tad
i
do
know
neither
do
i
wish
i
had
a
shirt
i
spoil
my
complexion
clear
down
to
my
waist
resides
i
not
fit
to
be
seen
you
lucky
to
be
alive
growled
tad
i
going
to
get
out
of
this
how
listen
and
you
know
i
going
to
get
on
the
pony
then
as
soon
as
i
in
the
saddle
you
jump
up
behind
me
and
we
start
back
to
camp
not
not
through
that
fire
protested
stacy
no
i
do
dare
try
it
i
afraid
we
get
lost
in
the
smoke
and
perhaps
get
burned
as
well
we
ride
out
some
distance
then
turn
to
the
left
and
try
to
go
around
the
burned
district
what
if
the
indians
chase
us
i
do
believe
they
will
they
hardly
dare
do
that
and
besides
these
may
be
friendly
indians
huh
grunted
stacy
they
look
it
tad
got
up
boldly
and
without
even
looking
toward
the
silent
red
men
began
fussing
about
his
saddle
cinching
the
girths
and
straightening
the
saddle
his
last
act
before
mounting
was
to
see
that
the
coils
of
his
lariat
were
in
order
all
right
announced
the
lad
vaulting
into
the
saddle
stacy
scrambled
up
behind
him
without
loss
of
time
and
they
rode
out
into
the
open
the
fat
boy
peering
apprehensively
over
his
shoulder
you
keep
watch
of
them
chunky
but
do
let
them
see
you
doing
it
i
wo
look
at
them
at
all
we
do
want
them
to
think
afraid
stacy
fidgeted
you
bet
i
watch
wish
i
had
my
rifle
i
do
huh
you
have
distinguished
yourself
quite
enough
with
that
rifle
as
it
is
we
do
want
any
more
of
your
fancy
shooting
there
they
go
warned
stacy
i
see
them
tad
had
been
cautiously
observing
the
horsemen
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
moving
in
the
same
direction
we
are
i
like
the
looks
of
it
still
if
they
do
get
any
nearer
we
may
be
thankful
the
pony
carrying
the
boys
was
walking
easily
and
the
mounts
of
the
indians
were
doing
the
same
jog
a
little
suggested
stacy
that
a
good
idea
it
will
tell
us
quickly
whether
they
are
trying
to
keep
up
with
us
he
touched
the
pony
lightly
with
his
spurs
the
little
animal
switched
its
tail
for
its
sides
were
tender
and
started
off
there
they
go
tad
jogging
the
same
gait
as
ours
tad
face
took
on
the
stubborn
look
it
always
wore
when
he
had
determined
upon
a
certain
course
of
action
i
beat
them
yet
even
if
there
are
only
two
of
them
i
wish
there
were
two
of
us
on
this
nag
i
get
off
and
walk
suggested
stacy
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
that
would
be
a
nice
thing
to
do
would
it
they
round
you
up
they
could
a
lame
burro
say
tad
what
i
got
an
idea
what
is
it
you
know
that
sage
hen
we
had
yes
what
that
got
to
do
with
our
present
predicament
i
was
wondering
why
there
are
any
sage
roosters
you
be
a
sage
rooster
with
your
head
off
first
thing
you
know
snapped
tad
in
disgust
ca
you
be
serious
for
a
minute
do
you
see
we
are
in
a
fix
there
that
fellow
is
trying
to
head
us
off
one
of
the
indians
had
shot
away
from
his
companion
running
obliquely
toward
the
point
to
which
tad
was
headed
the
red
man
had
gotten
quite
a
start
before
the
boys
caught
the
significance
of
his
manoeuvre
tad
dug
in
the
spurs
at
that
instant
the
fat
boy
hands
had
been
removed
from
tad
to
whose
body
they
had
been
clinging
the
pony
leaped
forward
and
stacy
slid
over
its
rump
hitting
the
ground
with
a
jolt
that
jarred
him
wow
howled
stacy
tad
instantly
divining
what
had
happened
pulled
up
sharply
wheeled
and
raced
back
to
where
his
companion
was
still
complaining
loudly
and
rubbing
his
body
get
up
roared
tad
leaning
over
and
grasping
stacy
by
the
hair
of
his
head
the
fat
boy
was
jerked
sharply
to
his
feet
quick
quick
climb
up
here
with
the
help
of
his
companion
the
lad
scrambled
up
behind
tad
again
muttering
and
rubbing
himself
by
this
time
the
leading
horseman
had
wholly
outdistanced
them
and
his
pony
was
now
loping
along
easily
while
the
second
indian
appeared
to
be
riding
directly
toward
them
at
right
angles
to
the
direction
in
which
they
were
traveling
all
at
once
the
two
indians
began
riding
about
the
boys
in
a
circle
uttering
short
little
yips
intended
to
terrify
the
lads
but
not
loud
enough
to
be
heard
any
great
distance
away
hang
on
we
going
to
ride
for
keeps
now
warned
tad
the
fat
boy
threw
both
arms
about
his
companion
waist
as
the
pony
let
out
into
a
swift
run
at
first
tad
thought
he
had
gotten
safely
out
of
the
circle
only
to
discover
that
they
had
headed
him
again
the
circle
was
narrowing
and
the
indians
were
gradually
drawing
in
on
them
stacy
eyes
were
growing
larger
every
minute
perhaps
more
from
astonishment
than
from
fear
then
too
he
could
not
but
admire
the
riding
of
their
pursuers
even
the
blankets
of
the
indians
appeared
not
to
be
disturbed
in
the
least
by
their
rapid
riding
the
horsemen
sitting
a
little
sideways
on
the
ponies
backs
the
reins
bunched
loosely
in
their
left
bands
they
got
us
tad
they
sha
get
us
retorted
tad
stubbornly
if
they
do
use
their
guns
and
i
do
believe
they
will
we
beat
them
yet
if
stacy
was
doubtful
he
did
not
say
so
if
they
get
close
to
us
you
be
ready
to
let
go
of
me
when
i
give
the
word
cautioned
tad
what
for
what
you
going
to
do
i
do
know
yet
that
depends
upon
circumstances
i
not
going
to
let
them
have
it
all
their
own
way
while
i
got
a
pony
under
me
we
may
get
help
any
minute
too
so
the
longer
we
can
put
off
a
clash
the
better
it
will
be
for
us
who
you
mean
santa
claus
yes
they
closing
in
now
said
stacy
take
your
hands
away
from
my
waist
but
i
fall
off
tad
slip
one
hand
through
under
my
belt
and
take
hold
of
the
cantle
with
the
other
sit
as
low
as
you
can
so
as
not
to
get
in
my
way
stacy
obeyed
his
companion
directions
without
further
comment
but
he
was
all
curiosity
to
know
what
was
going
to
happen
next
the
indians
were
drawing
nearer
every
second
now
the
boys
could
see
the
expressions
on
their
evil
faces
intensified
by
the
streaks
of
yellow
and
red
paint
they
look
as
though
they
stuck
their
heads
in
a
paint
pail
was
chunky
muttered
comment
the
blankets
fell
away
from
the
racing
savages
flapped
on
the
rumps
of
the
bobbing
ponies
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
slipped
to
the
ground
a
rifle
was
reposing
in
each
man
holster
as
tad
observed
instantly
he
was
thankful
to
note
that
the
guns
were
not
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
the
lad
right
hand
had
dropped
carelessly
to
the
saddle
horn
the
fingers
cautiously
gathering
in
the
coils
of
the
lariat
that
hung
there
the
red
men
did
not
appear
to
have
observed
his
act
lie
low
commanded
tad
scarcely
above
a
whisper
stacy
settled
down
slowly
so
as
not
to
attract
attention
one
horseman
shot
directly
across
tad
course
striking
the
pony
full
in
the
face
as
he
did
so
and
causing
the
animal
to
brace
himself
so
suddenly
as
to
nearly
unseat
both
boys
tad
rope
was
in
the
air
in
a
twinkling
a
warning
shout
from
the
second
indian
who
was
just
to
the
rear
of
them
came
too
late
the
rope
shot
true
to
its
mark
and
the
first
savage
with
back
had
failed
to
observe
it
coming
the
great
loop
dropped
over
his
head
the
pony
braced
itself
and
tad
took
a
quick
turn
of
the
rope
about
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
the
result
was
instantaneous
the
indian
was
catapulted
from
his
saddle
with
arms
pinioned
to
his
aide
howled
chunky
unable
to
restrain
his
enthusiasm
tad
did
not
even
hear
him
look
out
here
comes
the
other
one
warned
the
fat
boy
but
tad
was
too
busily
engaged
in
keeping
the
line
taut
about
the
roped
indian
the
fellow
was
struggling
on
the
ground
fighting
to
free
himself
while
the
boy
with
the
rope
was
manoeuvring
his
pony
in
a
series
of
movements
that
made
the
fat
boy
head
swim
take
care
of
him
chunky
i
ca
gasped
tad
stacy
eyes
took
on
a
belligerent
expression
as
the
second
savage
bore
down
upon
them
with
knees
gripped
tightly
against
the
side
of
his
pony
half
raising
himself
above
the
animal
back
reins
dropped
on
the
pony
neck
the
indian
was
guiding
his
mount
by
the
pressure
of
legs
and
knees
alone
the
angry
redskin
was
making
futile
attempts
to
get
into
a
position
where
he
might
grab
the
active
tad
he
did
not
seem
to
take
into
account
the
cringing
figure
behind
the
boy
who
had
roped
the
other
indian
all
at
once
at
the
opportune
moment
his
pony
forging
ahead
the
indian
hand
shot
out
the
red
bony
fingers
were
closing
upon
tad
butler
right
shoulder
when
all
at
once
something
happened
the
cringing
fat
boy
rose
the
right
hand
that
had
been
clinging
to
the
cantle
was
launched
out
his
body
thrown
forward
at
the
same
time
lent
the
blow
added
force
chunky
fist
came
into
violent
contact
with
the
indian
jaw
redman
disappeared
from
the
back
of
his
pony
so
quickly
that
for
a
second
stacy
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
howled
the
fat
boy
beat
it
for
the
tall
grass
tad
a
quick
glance
behind
him
revealed
the
true
state
of
affairs
to
tad
butler
he
dug
in
the
spurs
clinging
to
the
lariat
for
a
few
feet
then
suddenly
releasing
it
as
the
pony
leaped
away
under
the
stinging
pressure
of
the
spurs
duck
duck
they
going
to
shoot
shouted
tad
chapter
xv
hit
by
a
dry
storm
there
it
goes
lower
chunky
a
rifle
had
crashed
somewhere
to
the
left
of
them
stacy
curiosity
getting
the
better
of
him
he
had
twisted
his
body
around
and
was
peering
back
but
he
was
bobbing
up
and
down
so
fast
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
fix
his
eyes
on
any
one
point
long
enough
to
distinguish
what
that
object
was
look
look
he
cried
when
in
a
long
rise
of
the
pony
his
eyes
had
caught
something
definite
the
roped
indian
was
running
for
his
pony
which
he
caught
leaping
to
its
back
and
dashing
away
madly
hold
up
hold
up
there
something
doing
shouted
the
fat
boy
tad
swerved
a
little
turning
to
his
left
rifles
were
banging
and
the
dust
was
spurting
up
under
the
feet
of
the
savage
racing
pony
by
this
time
the
second
indian
had
recovered
from
the
blow
that
stacy
had
landed
on
his
jaw
and
he
too
was
in
his
saddle
in
a
twinkling
tearing
madly
cross
the
plain
stacy
brown
uttered
a
series
of
wild
whoops
and
yells
he
knew
their
assailants
were
running
and
that
some
one
was
shooting
at
the
indians
but
who
it
was
the
fat
boy
could
only
guess
two
ponies
suddenly
dashed
out
from
the
smoke
cloud
one
of
their
riders
was
swinging
his
sombrero
and
cheering
the
other
was
firing
his
rifle
after
the
fleeing
savages
hooray
it
santa
claus
howled
stacy
fairly
beside
himself
with
excitement
even
tad
caught
something
of
his
companion
spirit
of
enthusiasm
he
swung
his
hand
and
started
galloping
toward
the
two
horsemen
shoot
kill
howled
chunky
but
santa
claus
merely
shook
his
head
and
after
refilling
the
magazine
of
his
rifle
slipped
it
into
the
holster
it
would
only
make
trouble
and
probably
cause
an
uprising
if
i
did
they
know
i
could
have
winged
them
both
had
i
wanted
to
he
grinned
well
you
boys
are
a
sight
i
i
lost
my
shirt
interjected
stacy
and
i
suppose
you
fell
in
chuckled
ned
no
i
fell
off
we
lucky
to
be
alive
laughed
tad
you
are
that
i
see
now
that
professor
zepplin
was
right
when
he
said
you
could
take
care
of
yourself
never
saw
anything
quite
so
slick
as
the
way
you
roped
that
redskin
and
and
i
punched
the
other
one
glowed
chunky
did
you
see
us
questioned
tad
yes
we
saw
the
whole
proceeding
but
you
were
so
mixed
up
that
we
could
fire
without
danger
of
hitting
one
of
you
boys
wonder
what
those
apaches
think
struck
them
laughed
the
guide
how
did
you
get
through
the
fire
tad
explained
briefly
at
the
same
time
accounting
for
the
loss
of
stacy
shirt
i
bet
that
the
fellow
with
the
face
has
a
sore
jaw
bubbled
stacy
no
doubt
of
it
master
stacy
i
did
suppose
you
had
such
a
punch
as
that
you
a
good
indian
fighter
always
was
answered
the
fat
boy
swelling
with
importance
come
we
have
to
hurry
back
it
will
be
dark
before
we
reach
camp
as
it
is
and
the
professor
will
be
worrying
about
you
they
turned
about
and
heading
across
the
burned
area
started
for
camp
fitful
blazes
were
springing
up
here
and
there
but
all
danger
had
by
this
time
passed
though
the
smoke
still
hung
heavy
and
the
odor
of
burned
vegetation
smote
the
nostrils
unpleasantly
stacy
sniffed
the
air
suspiciously
tastes
like
a
drug
store
fire
i
smelled
once
in
chillicothe
he
averred
i
have
made
up
my
mind
yet
how
that
fire
started
kringle
wondered
tad
i
have
replied
the
guide
tersely
how
it
was
set
afire
by
whom
by
one
of
those
savages
or
by
somebody
who
was
with
them
they
must
have
been
watching
you
all
the
time
did
you
recognize
either
of
them
as
the
fellow
you
knocked
down
the
other
might
no
i
do
think
i
would
know
the
indian
the
light
was
too
uncertain
at
the
fire
dance
and
then
again
all
indians
look
alike
to
me
it
was
a
narrow
escape
do
you
think
they
come
back
again
questioned
ned
i
doubt
it
they
wo
if
they
recognized
me
they
know
me
done
business
with
me
before
professor
zepplin
and
walter
were
overjoyed
when
at
last
the
party
rode
into
camp
and
they
learned
that
both
boys
were
safe
the
lads
were
obliged
to
go
all
over
their
experiences
again
for
the
benefit
of
the
professor
and
walter
it
getting
worse
and
worse
decided
the
professor
helplessly
i
do
know
where
all
this
is
going
to
end
i
thought
when
we
got
a
new
guide
but
what
the
use
do
you
think
we
had
better
start
mr
kringle
no
there
is
no
necessity
what
am
i
going
to
do
for
a
pony
asked
chunky
you
can
ride
one
of
mine
i
always
take
two
when
on
a
long
journey
replied
the
guide
chunky
first
act
after
reaching
camp
was
to
provide
himself
with
a
shirt
after
donning
it
he
announced
that
he
had
an
appetite
and
wanted
to
know
when
they
were
going
to
have
supper
why
you
had
supper
hours
ago
scoffed
ned
want
another
one
already
that
was
supper
that
was
four
tea
indian
fighters
must
have
real
food
stop
teasing
we
give
the
baby
his
milk
returned
ned
that
night
kris
kringle
remained
on
guard
himself
he
would
not
trust
the
guardianship
of
the
camp
to
any
of
the
boys
for
he
fully
expected
that
they
would
receive
a
visit
from
one
or
more
of
the
indians
though
he
did
not
tell
the
others
so
but
nothing
occurred
to
disturb
the
camp
and
the
boys
despite
their
trying
experiences
slept
soundly
awakening
in
the
morning
fresh
and
active
ready
and
anxious
for
any
further
adventures
the
party
set
out
shortly
after
sunrise
and
traveled
all
day
across
the
uneven
plains
across
short
mountain
ranges
through
deep
gorges
and
rugged
foothills
crossing
an
open
space
the
guide
espied
a
bottle
glistening
in
the
sunlight
there
a
bottle
pointed
the
guide
want
it
stacy
glanced
at
it
indifferently
what
do
i
want
of
a
bottle
then
i
take
it
decided
the
guide
dismounting
and
stowing
the
abandoned
piece
of
glass
in
his
saddle
bags
bottles
are
good
for
only
two
things
and
what
are
they
master
stacy
questioned
the
professor
to
keep
things
in
and
to
shoot
at
replied
the
fat
boy
wisely
everybody
laughed
at
that
i
guess
that
embodies
everything
you
can
say
about
bottles
smiled
the
professor
your
logic
at
times
young
man
is
unassailable
chunky
nodded
he
had
a
faint
idea
of
what
professor
zepplin
meant
late
that
afternoon
the
travelers
came
upon
a
shack
in
the
foothills
where
an
old
rancher
a
hermit
lived
when
not
tending
his
little
flock
of
sheep
most
of
which
kris
kringle
said
the
old
man
had
stolen
from
droves
that
came
up
over
the
trail
going
north
he
was
an
interesting
old
character
this
hermit
and
the
boys
decided
that
they
would
like
to
make
camp
and
have
him
take
supper
with
them
this
the
professor
and
the
guide
readily
agreed
to
for
everyone
was
hot
and
dusty
and
the
bronchos
were
nervous
and
the
boys
found
the
old
rancher
talkative
enough
on
all
subjects
save
himself
when
chunky
asked
him
where
he
came
from
and
what
for
the
old
man
face
flushed
angrily
at
the
first
opportunity
the
guide
took
the
fat
boy
aside
for
some
fatherly
advice
in
this
country
it
is
good
policy
to
be
too
curious
about
a
family
affairs
he
likely
to
resent
it
in
a
way
you
wo
like
most
fellows
out
here
have
reasons
for
being
out
of
the
world
beyond
what
apparent
on
the
surface
chunky
heeded
the
advice
and
asked
no
more
personal
questions
for
the
next
hour
though
he
did
forget
himself
before
the
evening
was
ended
you
seem
to
be
having
pretty
dry
weather
down
here
said
the
professor
by
way
of
starting
the
old
man
to
talking
yep
have
had
any
rain
in
this
belt
fer
the
last
two
years
two
years
exclaimed
the
boys
yep
had
a
few
light
dews
but
that
all
replied
the
hermit
looks
to
me
as
if
you
were
going
to
get
some
announced
tad
reckon
not
then
i
no
judge
of
weather
even
as
tad
spoke
there
was
a
low
muttering
of
thunder
and
the
far
lightning
flashed
pale
and
green
and
rose
on
the
long
horizon
to
the
southwest
kris
kringle
heard
the
far
away
growl
springing
up
he
began
staking
down
the
tents
that
a
good
idea
we
lost
our
whole
outfit
on
our
last
trip
think
they
stand
a
blow
i
guess
they
will
when
i
get
through
with
them
have
we
any
more
stakes
in
camp
there
should
be
some
in
the
kit
tad
searched
until
he
found
several
more
stakes
and
with
these
and
the
emergency
ropes
they
made
the
tents
secure
by
the
time
they
had
done
so
the
heavens
had
grown
black
and
menacing
they
could
see
the
storm
sweeping
down
on
them
it
was
a
magnificent
sight
and
the
lads
were
so
lost
in
observing
its
grandeur
that
they
forgot
to
feel
any
alarm
a
cloud
of
dust
accompanied
the
advance
guard
of
the
storm
reckon
there
ai
any
rain
in
them
clouds
commented
the
old
man
there
plenty
of
the
other
thing
though
what
the
other
thing
questioned
chunky
lightning
even
as
he
spoke
a
bolt
descended
right
in
the
center
of
the
camp
tearing
a
hole
in
the
earth
and
hurling
a
cloud
of
dirt
and
dust
many
feet
up
into
the
air
the
force
of
the
explosion
knocked
some
of
the
party
flat
chunky
picked
himself
up
and
carefully
brushed
his
clothes
then
solemnly
walked
out
and
sat
down
on
the
spot
where
the
lightning
had
struck
here
here
what
are
you
doing
out
there
demanded
the
guide
sitting
on
the
lightning
you
come
in
here
and
quick
at
that
huh
guess
i
know
what
i
doing
lightning
never
strikes
twice
in
the
same
place
i
by
this
time
kris
kringle
had
the
fat
boy
by
the
collar
hustling
him
to
the
protection
of
one
of
the
tents
no
sooner
had
they
reached
it
than
a
crash
that
seemed
as
if
it
had
split
the
earth
wide
open
descended
upon
them
balls
of
fire
shot
off
in
every
direction
one
went
right
through
the
tent
where
they
were
huddled
hurling
the
pony
rider
boys
in
a
heap
they
scrambled
up
calling
to
each
other
nervously
the
shock
had
extinguished
the
lantern
that
hung
in
the
tent
the
guide
relighted
it
and
stepping
outside
to
see
what
had
happened
pointed
to
the
place
where
chunky
had
been
sitting
but
a
few
minutes
before
the
bolt
had
struck
in
the
identical
spot
where
the
previous
one
had
landed
now
young
man
there
an
object
lesson
for
you
kringle
said
with
a
grim
smile
and
there
another
replied
chunky
pointing
to
the
outside
of
the
tent
there
lay
the
old
rancher
whose
absence
they
had
not
noted
he
had
been
in
the
tent
with
them
when
they
last
saw
him
and
how
he
had
gotten
out
there
none
knew
the
rancher
had
been
stripped
of
every
vestige
of
clothing
by
the
freaky
lightning
he
dead
crooned
stacy
solemnly
get
water
quick
he
been
struck
by
lightning
commanded
the
guide
making
systematic
efforts
to
bring
the
old
man
back
to
consciousness
stacy
ran
for
the
i
am
afraid
it
is
useless
kringle
warned
the
professor
failing
to
find
a
pulse
the
boys
were
standing
about
fanning
the
victim
having
one
by
one
dumped
the
contents
of
their
canteens
in
his
face
stacy
returned
with
a
after
a
little
i
i
i
got
an
idea
he
exploded
as
with
eyes
wide
open
he
attempted
to
tell
them
something
keep
still
we
got
something
else
to
do
besides
listening
to
your
foolishness
chided
ned
chunky
we
trying
to
save
this
man
life
give
me
that
bag
commanded
tad
the
two
older
men
were
working
desperately
on
the
patient
stacy
stood
around
fidgeting
a
little
but
making
no
further
attempt
to
enlighten
them
as
to
what
his
new
idea
was
after
a
time
the
rancher
began
to
show
signs
of
recovering
he
gasped
a
few
times
then
opened
his
eyes
what
kicked
me
he
asked
with
a
they
could
all
afford
to
laugh
now
and
they
did
the
rancher
refused
their
offer
of
clothes
saying
he
had
another
suit
in
his
shack
that
twice
the
stuff
has
knocked
me
out
next
time
it
git
me
for
keeps
he
said
does
it
strike
here
very
often
questioned
the
professor
allus
then
there
must
be
some
mineral
substance
in
the
soil
no
ai
nothing
like
that
jest
contrariness
that
all
hit
my
shack
once
and
was
raining
bored
holes
in
the
roof
so
the
place
got
all
wet
inside
but
it
is
raining
now
does
it
usually
rain
when
you
have
a
thunder
storm
here
asked
the
professor
no
ai
had
no
rain
in
nigh
onto
two
year
the
hermit
reiterated
you
better
go
and
put
on
some
clothes
suggested
kris
kringle
guess
that
right
the
old
man
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
condition
the
others
had
wrapped
a
blanket
around
him
which
seemed
to
satisfy
his
demand
for
clothes
gathering
up
the
blanket
he
strolled
leisurely
toward
his
cabin
undisturbed
by
his
recent
experience
nothing
like
getting
used
to
it
chuckled
stacy
hello
now
we
hear
what
your
new
idea
is
chunky
jeered
ned
yes
what
is
it
urged
tad
nothing
much
never
is
cut
in
walter
perkins
a
little
maliciously
i
i
got
an
idea
the
ponies
tried
to
kick
holes
in
the
lightning
everybody
laughed
loudly
they
could
well
afford
to
laugh
now
that
the
danger
had
passed
what
makes
you
think
that
asked
the
guide
eyeing
him
sharply
they
dead
what
shouted
the
boys
all
hands
dashed
from
the
tent
stacy
regarding
them
with
soulful
eyes
after
which
he
surreptitiously
slipped
a
biscuit
into
his
pocket
and
strolled
out
after
them
chapter
xvi
chunky
new
idea
three
of
the
ponies
they
found
had
been
knocked
down
and
so
severely
shocked
that
they
were
only
just
beginning
to
regain
consciousness
why
did
you
tell

ned
turning
on
stacy
savagely
you
would
let
me
maybe
next
time
i
got
an
idea

stop
and
listen
kris
kringle
face
wore
a
broad
grin
master
stacy
is
right
he
tried
hard
enough
to
tell
us
he
said
chunky
was
humming
blithely
as
the
party
set
out
next
morning
he
was
pretty
well
satisfied
with
himself
for
had
he
not
been
through
a
prairie
fire
knocked
a
savage
apache
off
his
horse
saved
himself
and
his
companions
besides
having
just
escaped
from
being
struck
by
lightning
stacy
swelled
out
his
chest
and
held
his
chin
a
little
bit
higher
than
usual
chunky
got
a
swelled
head
said
ned
nodding
in
the
direction
of
the
fat
boy

walter
nobody

a
better
right
chunky

half
as
big

fool
as
he

believe
when
we
think

having
lots
of
fun

him
he

chunky
retorted
ned
he
the
oracle
of
the
party

answered
walter
motioning
for
stacy
to
join
them
which
the
latter
did
leisurely
we
want
to
know
if
you
think
we
seen
the
last
of
the
apaches
will
they
bother
us
any
more
the
fat
boy
consulted
the
sky
thoughtfully
i
think
there
some
of
them
around
now
he
replied
what
stacy
nodded
wisely
santa
claus
ought
to
have
shot
them
why
you
savage
scoffed
ned
the
idea
you
see
i
have
done
it
myself
if
i
had
my
gun
declared
stacy
bravely
good
thing
for
you
that
your
gun
was
in
camp
instead
of
in
your
holster
yes
i
have
lost
the
gun
when
the
pony
went
down
poor
pony
say
walt
he
murmured
leaning
over
toward
his
companion
well
out
with
it
this
pony

santa
claus
can
jump
further
than
a
kangaroo
ever

sneered
ned
no
but
i
seen
you
try
to
i
show
you
walt
when
we
get
a
chance
to
go
out
and
have
a
contest
that
would
be
good
sport

it
ned
what
a
jumping
contest
if
we
did
break
our
necks
ca
break
a
pony
rider
boy
neck
they
too
tough
laughed
walter
to
which
sentiment
stacy
brown
agreed
with
a
series
of
emphatic
nods
say
tad
called
walter
what
do
you
say
to
our
jumping
our
ponies
some
time
tad
grinned
appreciatively
if
the
stock
is
too
tired
when
we
make
camp
i
think
it
would
be
great
fun
we
have
had
any
real
jumping
contests
in
a
long
time
wish
we
had
our
stallions
here
tad
they
better
off
at
home
chunky
altogether
too
valuable
horses
for
this
kind
of
work
i
speak
to
the
guide
well
what
is
it
young
man
smiled
kris
kringle
if
you
can
find
a
level
place
for
our
camp
we
want
to
have
a
contest
this
afternoon
professor
will
you
join
us
what
kind
of
a
contest
jumping
no
thank
you
we
will
camp
in
the
foothills
of
the
black
range
you
will
find
plenty
of
level
ground
there
for
your
purpose
said
the
guide
in
order
that
they
might
have
more
time
for
their
games
an
early
halt
was
called
the
first
work
was
to
pitch
the
camp
the
ponies
being
allowed
to
graze
and
rest
in
the
meantime
after
which
the
lads
started
out
on
a
broad
open
plain
for
their
sport
their
shouts
of
merriment
drifted
back
to
the
camp
where
kris
kringle
and
professor
zepplin
were
setting
things
to
rights
and
preparing
an
early
supper
the
sun
still
being
some
hours
high
that
a
great
bunch
of
boys
professor
great
for
getting
into
difficulties
and
for
getting
out
of
them
i
put
them
against
any
other
four
lads
in
the
world
for
hunting
out
trouble
laughed
the
professor
the
result
of
the
afternoon
sport
was
a
total
of
several
spills
and
numerous
black
and
blue
spots
on
the
bodies
of
the
pony
rider
boys
stacy
brown
on
kris
kringle
pony
carried
off
the
honors
having
taken
a
higher
jump
than
did
any
of
his
companions
then
stacy
did
it
again
after
the
others
had
tried
and
failed
to
equal
the
record
the
games
being
finished
tad
and
walter
rode
off
to
get
a
closer
view
of
some
peculiar
rock
formations
that
they
had
discovered
in
the
high
distance
while
ned
and
chunky
started
slowly
for
the
camp
the
table
had
been
set
out
in
front
of
the
tents
when
the
fat
boy
and
his
companion
came
in
sight
of
the
camp
whew
but
i
hungry
announced
stacy
brown
but
you
did
think
of
it
until
you
saw
the
table
set
did
you
it
was
the
table
it
was
the
shaking
up
i
got
back
there
that
made
me
feel
full
of
emptiness
huh
i
got
an
idea
ned
for
goodness
sake
keep
it
to
yourself
then
when
you
have
an
idea
it
spells
trouble
for
everybody
else
around
you
bet
you
i
can
can
what
snorted
ned
bet
you
i
can
jump
the
dinner
table
and
you
ca
bet
you
ca
bet
i
can
and
without
even
knocking
a
fly
off
the
milk
pitcher
go
on
you
you
try
it
first
and
if
you
do
make
it
you
lose
i
do
have
to
try
it
if
i
do
want
to
agreed
ned
with
rare
prudence
chunky
was
fairly
hugging
himself
with
glee
but
he
took
good
care
that
ned
rector
did
not
observe
his
satisfaction
if
you
do
you
a
tenderfoot
taunted
stacy
i
show
you
who
the
tenderfoot
you
go
ahead
and
bolt
the
dinner
table
and
all
if
you
dare
now
then
stacy
gathered
up
his
reins
there
was
mischief
in
his
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
the
table
neatly
set
for
the
evening
meal
you
start
right
after
me
they
be
surprised
to
see
a
procession
of
ponies
going
over
the
table
wo
they
somebody
be
surprised
may
not
be
the
professor
and
santa
claus
though
growled
ned
stacy
had
his
own
ideas
on
this
question
but
he
did
not
confide
them
to
his
companion
the
fat
boy
clucked
to
his
pony
and
the
little
animal
started
off
as
they
moved
along
stacy
used
the
persuasive
spurs
resulting
in
a
sudden
burst
of
speed
come
on
he
shouted
he
heard
ned
pony
pursuing
him
howled
the
shrill
voice
of
the
fat
boy
professor
zepplin
and
kris
kringle
were
sitting
at
opposite
ends
of
the
table
with
elbows
leaning
on
it
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
there
had
been
so
much
yelling
out
on
the
plain
ever
since
the
boys
left
camp
that
the
older
men
gave
no
heed
to
this
new
shout
did
not
even
turn
their
eyes
in
the
direction
whence
stacy
brown
and
his
pony
were
sweeping
down
on
them
at
speed
suddenly
the
two
men
started
back
with
a
sudden
exclamation
as
a
shadow
fell
athwart
the
table
and
a
dark
form
hurled
itself
through
the
air
while
a
shrill
sounded
right
over
their
heads
the
fat
boy
cleared
the
table
without
so
much
as
disturbing
the
fly
to
which
he
had
referred
when
making
the
arrangement
kris
kringle
face
wore
an
expansive
grin
as
he
discovered
the
cause
of
the
interruption
but
professor
zepplin
face
reflected
no
such
emotion
he
was
angry
he
started
to
rise
when
a
second
shadow
fell
across
the
table
ned
rector
not
to
be
outdone
by
his
fat
little
friend
pursed
his
lips
tightly
driving
his
broncho
at
the
dinner
table
and
pressing
in
the
spurs
so
hard
that
the
pony
grunted
with
anger
up
went
the
broncho
in
a
graceful
curving
leap
but
the
pony
or
its
rider
had
not
calculated
the
distance
properly
both
rear
hoofs
went
through
the
table
whisking
it
off
the
ground
from
before
the
astonished
eyes
of
professor
zepplin
and
kris
kringle
both
men
drew
back
so
violently
that
they
toppled
over
backwards
the
crashing
of
dishes
and
the
sound
of
breaking
wood
the
dinner
table
shot
up
into
the
air
while
the
pony
ploughed
the
ground
with
its
nose
ned
rector
struck
the
ground
some
distance
farther
on
he
slid
on
his
face
for
several
feet
skinning
his
nose
and
filling
mouth
eyes
and
nose
with
dirt
then
dishes
and
pieces
of
table
began
to
rain
down
on
them
in
a
perfect
shower
a
can
of
condensed
milk
emptied
itself
on
the
head
of
professor
zepplin
while
a
hot
biscuit
lodged
inside
the
collar
of
santa
claus
shirt
wow
oh
wow
howled
the
fat
boy
falling
off
his
pony
in
the
excess
of
his
merriment
and
rolling
on
the
ground
chapter
xvii
in
the
home
of
the
cave
dwellers
ned
rector
sat
up
just
in
time
to
meet
the
wreck
of
the
descending
table
down
he
went
again
with
stacy
howls
ringing
in
his
ears
a
firm
hand
jerked
rector
free
of
the
debris
as
kris
kringle
laughing
heartily
hauled
ned
to
his
feet
at
the
same
moment
professor
zepplin
had
laid
more
violent
hands
on
the
fat
boy
whom
he
shook
until
stacy
howls
lost
much
of
their
mirth
about
this
time
tad
and
walter
rode
in
having
hurried
along
upon
hearing
the
disturbance
in
camp
stacy
brown
are
you
responsible
for
this
demanded
the
professor
sternly
i
more
to
blame
than
he
is
interposed
ned
no
i
i
had
an
idea
chuckled
stacy
threatening
to
break
out
into
another
howl
of
mirth
next
time
you
have
one
then
you
will
be
good
enough
to
let
me
know
we
will
tie
you
up
until
the
impulse
to
make
trouble
has
passed
tad
and
walter
could
not
resist
a
shout
of
laughter
kris
kringle
was
not
slow
to
follow
the
example
set
by
them
and
all
at
once
professor
zepplin
forgot
his
dignity
sitting
right
down
amid
the
wreck
and
laughing
immoderately
ned
washed
his
face
and
when
upon
facing
them
he
exhibited
a
peeled
nose
and
a
black
eye
the
merriment
was
renewed
again
supper
was
a
success
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
many
of
their
dishes
were
utterly
ruined
as
well
as
some
of
the
provisions
but
the
lads
gathered
up
the
pieces
and
made
the
best
of
a
bad
job
fortunately
they
carried
another
folding
table
that
they
had
had
made
for
their
trip
and
this
was
soon
spread
and
a
fresh
meal
prepared
well
have
you
two
been
getting
into
difficulties
also
questioned
the
professor
after
they
sat
down
to
supper
no
we
been
exploring
walter
and
i
answered
tad
exploring
yes
we
discovered
something
that
i
should
like
to
know
more
about
what
is
that
asked
kris
kringle
looking
up
interestedly
we
were
over
yonder
close
to
the
mountains
which
are
straight
up
and
down
and
half
way
to
the
top
we
saw
three
or
four
rocks
that
looked
like
houses
or
huts
did
you
ever
see
them
mr
kringle
no
but
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
they
must
be
some
of
the
cave
dwellings
of
the
ancient
pueblos
or
perhaps
as
far
back
as
the
toltecs
they
built
their
homes
in
caves
on
the
steep
rocks
for
better
protection
against
their
enemies
and
nobody
ever
discovered
these
before
questioned
walter
how
queer
perhaps
these
dwellings
if
such
they
are
have
been
seen
by
many
a
traveler
none
of
whom
had
interest
enough
in
the
matter
to
investigate
then
again
they
may
have
been
fully
explored
not
much
in
this
part
of
the
country
that
prospectors
have
not
looked
over
may
we
explore
these
caves
professor
asked
tad
please
let
us
urged
walter
i
see
no
objection
if
kringle
will
be
responsible
for
you
i
rather
think
i
look
into
them
myself
i
confess
the
idea
interests
me
are
they
easy
to
get
at
i
afraid
not
answered
tad
santa
claus
will
show
us
the
way
interrupted
stacy
enthusiastically
he
was
frowned
down
by
the
professor
why
not
start
now
urged
tad
the
guide
consulted
the
sun
we
might
it
lacks
all
of
three
hours
to
dark
there
was
much
enthusiasm
in
camp
the
idea
that
they
were
to
visit
some
unexplored
caves
dwellings
of
an
ancient
people
filled
the
lads
with
pleasant
expectancy
before
starting
kringle
sorted
out
some
strong
manila
rope
and
several
tent
stakes
all
of
which
he
did
up
into
two
bundles
then
he
filled
the
magazine
of
his
rifle
throwing
this
over
his
shoulder
what
that
for
questioned
ned
the
gun
yes
ca
tell
what
we
may
run
into
in
a
cave
you
know
after
a
final
look
at
the
camp
all
hands
set
out
for
the
place
indicated
by
tad
it
was
only
a
short
distance
so
they
decided
to
walk
reaching
the
base
of
the
mountain
they
gazed
up
yes
those
are
cave
dwellings
declared
kris
kringle
and
they
are
still
closed
probably
they
have
been
opened
in
two
hundred
years
i
hate
to
live
there
and
have
to
go
home
in
a
dark
night
mused
chunky
yes
how
did
they
get
to
their
houses
wondered
the
other
boys
the
question
is
how
are
we
going
to
get
near
enough
to
explore
them
how
shall
we
get
up
there
mr
guide
asked
the
professor
we
find
a
way
we
shall
have
to
climb
the
mountain
first
all
hands
began
clambering
up
the
rocks
to
do
so
they
were
obliged
to
follow
along
the
base
of
the
mountain
for
some
distance
before
they
found
a
place
that
they
could
climb
reaching
the
top
the
guide
examined
their
surroundings
carefully
see
those
little
projections
of
rock
slanting
down
toward
the
shelf
he
asked
yes
well
in
the
old
days
they
probably
felled
a
tree
so
it
would
fall
on
them
the
occupants
of
the
cave
probably
cut
steps
in
the
tree
trunk
over
which
to
travel
up
and
down
the
tree
has
rotted
away
many
years
since
and
we
ca
get
down
then
we
find
a
way
master
walter
i
thought
i
should
be
able
to
make
a
rope
ladder
that
would
work
but
i
see
it
is
not
practicable
how
shall
we
do
it
try
the
old
way
i
guess
master
tad
what
that
the
tree
but
there
are
no
trees
near
here
yes
there
are
a
few
rods
back
we
are
all
strong
and
i
guess
we
shall
be
able
to
make
a
pretty
fair
pair
of
steps
kris
kringle
had
brought
an
axe
with
him
with
this
he
cut
some
long
straight
poles
which
he
explained
were
intended
for
pike
poles
such
as
woodsmen
use
to
roll
logs
this
done
he
began
industriously
chopping
at
the
tree
after
deciding
upon
the
exact
position
in
which
he
desired
it
to
fall
it
wo
reach
declared
chunky
who
with
hands
in
pockets
legs
spread
wide
apart
stood
looking
up
at
the
flaring
top
of
the
great
tree
the
guide
stopped
chopping
long
enough
to
squint
at
the
fat
boy
it
reach
you
all
right
if
you
stay
where
you
are
he
said
then
resumed
his
vigorous
blows
stacy
promptly
took
the
hint
and
moved
a
safe
distance
away
get
from
under
shouted
the
guide
finally
one
more
blow
would
send
the
tree
crashing
downward
all
hands
scrambled
for
safety
one
powerful
blow
from
the
axe
and
with
a
crashing
and
rending
the
great
tree
began
its
descent
when
it
struck
the
onlookers
fully
expected
to
see
it
broken
into
many
pieces
but
the
bushy
top
hitting
the
rocks
first
broke
the
blow
and
the
body
of
the
tree
settled
down
gently
without
even
breaking
its
bark
fine
hurrah
shouted
the
boys
it
wo
reach
to
the
edge
going
to
pull
it
over
questioned
stacy
not
exactly
but
we
going
to
get
it
there
perhaps
we
shall
not
have
it
in
place
in
time
to
explore
the
caves
but
we
shall
be
ready
to
do
so
early
in
the
morning
it
took
our
friends
longer
to
do
this
job
two
hundred
years
or
more
ago
than
it
will
take
us
we
have
better
tools
to
work
with
and
better
bosses
suggested
stacy
some
little
time
was
consumed
in
chopping
the
tree
loose
from
its
stump
after
which
the
guide
worked
the
pike
poles
under
the
trunk
at
intervals
near
the
base
the
others
watched
these
operations
with
interest
now
here
is
where
you
young
gentlemen
will
have
a
chance
to
show
how
strong
you
are
each
one
grab
a
pike
pole
kringle
directed
sha
i
go
hold
the
top
down
asked
stacy
you
just
grab
a
pike
pole
and
get
busy
laughed
kringle
ca
get
out
of
work
quite
so
easy
as
you
thought
scoffed
ned
this
is
where
we
make
you
earn
your
supper
i
do
have
to
earn
it
had
it
already
there
are
other
meals
coming
smiled
the
professor
now
heo
he
all
raised
on
the
pike
poles
at
the
same
time
with
the
result
that
the
tree
was
forced
down
the
gentle
incline
several
feet
this
was
repeated
again
and
again
the
boys
pausing
to
cheer
after
every
lift
the
tree
being
now
perilously
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
kris
kringle
called
a
halt
next
he
fastened
a
rope
around
the
top
and
another
around
the
base
taking
a
turn
around
a
rock
with
each
one
boy
was
placed
on
each
rope
the
others
at
the
pike
poles
while
the
guide
stood
at
the
edge
giving
directions
the
tree
trunk
gently
slipped
over
under
his
guidance
and
a
few
minutes
later
rested
on
the
projecting
rocks
that
were
just
high
enough
to
hold
it
in
place
would
take
much
to
send
it
over
but
i
guess
it
will
be
perfectly
safe
he
mused
may
we
go
down
now
cried
the
boys
no
i
make
some
steps
first
he
did
so
with
the
axe
chopping
out
places
for
steps
until
finally
he
had
reached
the
rock
in
front
of
the
cave
dwellings
the
tree
lay
at
an
easy
slope
its
bushy
top
partly
resting
on
the
ledge
the
latter
being
some
eight
feet
deep
by
ten
feet
wide
running
up
the
log
kringle
made
another
rope
fast
at
the
top
throwing
the
free
end
over
hold
on
to
the
rope
while
you
are
going
down
and
you
be
in
no
danger
of
falling
he
warned
the
boys
scrambled
down
the
tree
like
so
many
squirrels
the
professor
following
somewhat
more
cautiously
the
explorers
found
themselves
not
more
than
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
not
much
of
a
door
yard
where
the
garden
wondered
stacy
looking
about
him
curiously
the
entrance
to
the
cave
dwelling
was
blocked
by
a
huge
boulder
that
completely
filled
the
opening
how
it
had
been
gotten
there
none
could
say
the
only
possible
explanation
was
that
the
boulder
had
been
found
on
the
shelf
and
applied
to
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
cave
dwellers
home
now
we
here
we
ca
get
in
grumbled
ned
nothing
is
impossible
answered
kris
kringle
except
one
thing
what
that
master
ned
to
hammer
the
least
little
bit
of
sense
into
the
head
of
my
friend
chunky
brown
you
do
have
to
that
why
retorted
stacy
quickly
it
has
all
the
sense
it
hold
now
i
guess
that
will
be
about
all
for
you
ned
laughed
walter
at
least
chunky
did
foul
the
dinner
table
when
he
jumped
it
the
guide
in
the
meantime
was
experimenting
with
the
boulder
inserting
a
pike
pole
here
and
there
in
an
effort
to
move
the
big
stone
it
remained
in
place
as
solidly
as
if
it
had
grown
there
there
some
trick
about
the
thing
i
know
but
what
it
is
gets
me
better
stand
back
all
of
you
in
case
it
comes
out
all
of
a
sudden
kringle
warned
them
all
at
once
the
boulder
did
come
out
and
it
kept
on
coming
look
out
bellowed
the
guide
low
bridge
howled
stacy
hopping
to
one
side
and
crouching
against
the
rocks
the
guide
had
sprung
nimbly
to
one
side
as
well
the
big
rock
had
popped
out
like
a
pea
from
a
pod
instead
of
stopping
however
it
continued
to
roll
on
toward
the
edge
hug
the
rocks
she
going
down
shouted
the
guide
go
down
it
did
with
a
crash
that
seemed
to
shake
the
mountain
rolling
to
the
edge
of
the
shelf
it
had
toppled
over
taking
a
large
strip
of
shelving
rock
with
it
wow
howled
chunky
the
other
boys
uttered
no
sound
though
their
faces
were
a
little
more
pale
than
usual
kris
kringle
stepped
to
the
edge
peering
over
no
one
will
get
that
up
here
again
right
away
he
said
the
cave
the
cave
shouted
walter
everyone
turned
gazing
half
in
awe
at
the
dark
opening
that
the
removal
of
the
stone
had
revealed
an
opening
that
had
been
closed
for
probably
more
than
two
centuries
chapter
xviii
facing
the
enemy
guns
do
we
go
in
asked
the
professor
wait
i
get
some
light
inside
first
answered
the
prudent
guide
ca
tell
whether
we
shall
want
to
go
in
or
not
he
built
up
a
small
fire
within
then
called
to
the
others
that
they
might
enter
they
crowded
in
hastily
finding
themselves
in
a
fairly
large
chamber
at
the
far
end
of
which
was
a
sort
of
natural
alcove
in
the
rocks
the
remnants
of
a
fire
still
lay
at
one
side
where
the
last
meal
of
the
ancient
dweller
had
probably
been
cooked
several
crude
looking
utensils
lay
about
together
with
a
number
of
pieces
of
ancient
pottery
this
is
indeed
a
rare
find
exclaimed
the
professor
carrying
the
precious
jars
out
into
the
light
for
closer
examination
chunky
about
that
time
pounced
upon
an
object
which
proved
to
be
a
copper
hatchet
hurray
for
george
washington
he
shouted
brandishing
the
crude
tool
the
man
who
never
told
we
heard
that
before
objected
ned
give
us
something
new
chunky
if
you
got
to
talk
the
professor
came
in
searching
for
other
curios
just
as
stacy
went
out
to
examine
his
little
axe
as
he
was
pleased
to
call
it
he
tried
the
edge
of
it
on
the
ledge
to
find
out
if
the
stone
would
dull
it
but
it
did
not
i
use
that
to
cut
nails
and
wire
with
when
i
get
back
home
decided
the
boy
guess
i
chop
my
name
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
here
stacy
proceeded
to
do
so
the
others
being
too
much
engrossed
in
their
explorations
to
know
or
care
what
he
was
about
he
succeeded
very
well
both
in
making
letters
on
the
wall
and
in
putting
several
nicks
in
the
edge
of
his
hatchet
he
was
thus
engaged
when
all
at
once
something
struck
the
axe
hurling
it
from
his
hand
at
the
same
instant
a
rifle
crashed
off
somewhere
below
and
to
the
southeast
of
him
ouch
exclaimed
the
fat
boy
holding
his
hand
wonder
who
did
that
his
mind
had
not
coupled
the
shot
with
the
blow
on
the
hatchet
bang
a
bullet
flattened
itself
close
to
his
head
against
the
rock
with
a
howl
the
lad
threw
himself
down
on
the
ledge
at
that
instant
kris
kringle
sprang
to
the
opening
of
the
cave
what
does
this
mean
he
snapped
i
do
know
somebody
knocked
the
axe
out
of
my
hand
then
shot
at
me
the
guide
discovered
the
trouble
right
there
a
bullet
snipped
his
hat
from
his
head
and
striking
the
ceiling
of
the
dropped
to
the
floor
with
a
dull
clatter
kris
kringle
ducked
with
amazing
quickness
crawling
back
into
the
cave
he
reached
for
his
own
rifle
and
then
sought
the
opening
taking
good
care
not
to
expose
himself
to
the
fire
of
the
unseen
enemy
stacy
on
his
part
had
lost
no
time
in
getting
to
a
place
of
safety
inside
though
he
was
prudent
enough
to
crawl
instead
of
getting
up
and
walking
in
what
does
this
mean
it
ca
be
possible
that
anyone
is
deliberately
shooting
at
us
questioned
professor
zepplin
in
undisguised
amazement
if
you
doubt
it
step
outside
suggested
kris
kringle
master
stacy
and
myself
know
what
they
tried
to
do
do
we
lad
we
do
the
fat
boy
again
swelled
with
importance
look
out
you
do
swell
up
so
big
you
break
your
harness
warned
ned
better
break
it
than
have
it
shot
off
mumbled
stacy
who
can
it
be
i
ca
say
professor
it
our
friends
from
the
fire
dance
was
tad
expressed
conviction
told
you
they
be
here
nodded
chunky
why
do
you
shoot
at
them
going
to
in
a
minute
got
to
find
out
where
they
are
first
now
the
lads
were
excited
in
earnest
some
one
was
shooting
at
them
and
the
guide
was
going
to
fire
back
this
was
more
than
they
had
expected
when
they
visited
the
home
of
the
let
me
take
a
crack
at
begged
chunky
i
owe
one
master
stacy
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
reproved
the
professor
sternly
the
idea
no
if
there
any
shooting
to
be
done
i
do
it
announced
kris
kringle
and
santa
claus
is
shooting
with
any
toy
gun
this
time
chuckled
chunky
can
you
see
the
camp
to
know
if
anyone
is
there
yes
but
only
part
of
it
professor
i
wish
you
would
all
get
over
into
the
right
hand
corner
there
and
lie
flat
on
the
floor
i
going
to
try
to
draw
their
fire
so
that
i
can
locate
them
ca
afford
to
waste
ammunition
until
we
are
reasonably
sure
where
our
mark
is
the
others
quickly
got
into
the
position
indicated
placing
his
hat
on
one
of
the
pike
poles
kringle
slowly
pushed
it
outside
there
was
no
result
the
ruse
failed
to
draw
the
enemy
fire
oh
they
gone
we
a
lot
of
babies
jeered
ned
jumping
up
and
starting
for
the
opening
kris
kringle
gave
him
a
push
with
the
butt
of
the
rifle
want
to
get
shot
full
of
holes
wait
i
show
you
the
guide
sprang
up
showing
himself
out
on
the
ledge
for
one
brief
instant
then
throwing
himself
flat
a
sharp
ping
against
the
rocks
followed
by
a
heavy
report
told
the
story
the
guide
had
been
not
a
second
too
soon
in
getting
out
of
harm
way
for
the
bullet
would
have
gone
right
through
him
had
he
remained
standing
quick
as
a
flash
kringle
rifle
leaped
to
his
shoulder
and
he
fired
he
had
taken
quick
aim
at
a
puff
of
smoke
off
toward
the
camp
not
content
with
one
shot
he
raked
the
bushes
all
about
where
the
puff
of
smoke
had
been
seen
emptying
the
magazine
of
the
rifle
in
a
few
seconds
stacy
brown
was
fairly
dancing
with
glee
did
you
hit
anything
asked
the
boys
breathlessly
of
course
i
hit
something
but
whether
i
winged
an
indian
or
not
i
do
know
if
i
did
he
probably
is
not
seriously
wounded
hear
a
redskin
yell
when
he
hit
bad
that
one
i
punched
did
he
was
hit
hard
volunteered
stacy
he
did
have
time
grinned
tad
you
were
too
quick
for
him
look
out
there
comes
a
volley
warned
kringle
the
boys
led
by
the
professor
tumbled
into
the
corner
in
a
heap
while
the
lead
pattered
in
through
the
opening
rattling
with
great
force
like
a
handful
of
pebbles
they
getting
in
a
hurry
averred
the
professor
it
growing
dark
they
want
to
finish
us
before
then
so
we
play
any
tricks
on
them
after
that
but
if
they
only
knew
it
and
they
probably
do
they
got
us
beautifully
trapped
one
man
below
and
another
at
the
other
end
of
our
tree
would
be
able
to
keep
us
here
till
the
springs
run
dry
if
there
only
two
of
them
there
as
i
suspect
is
the
case
they
may
not
want
to
separate
we
see
the
minute
it
gets
dark
enough
so
that
we
can
move
about
without
being
observed
some
of
the
sage
brush
that
kris
kringle
had
brought
down
to
light
up
the
cave
lay
outside
on
the
ledge
using
one
of
the
poles
he
cautiously
raked
the
stuff
inside
heaping
it
up
not
far
from
the
entrance
what
you
doing
that
for
questioned
stacy
unable
to
conceal
his
curiosity
you
see
when
we
get
ready
to
do
something
else
you
do
think
i
going
to
stay
here
all
night
do
you
there
was
no
further
firing
on
either
side
though
kringle
showed
himself
boldly
several
times
finally
tad
tried
it
and
was
greeted
with
a
shot
the
instant
he
appeared
in
the
opening
must
be
me
they
after
he
suggested
with
a
forced
grin
falling
flat
on
the
ledge
and
wriggling
back
into
the
cave
the
twilight
was
upon
them
now
the
guide
had
been
able
to
see
the
flash
of
the
rifle
below
him
and
had
taken
a
quick
shot
at
it
when
the
enemy
attempted
to
wing
tad
butler
kringle
had
no
means
of
knowing
whether
his
shot
had
been
effective
or
not
i
going
to
try
something
else
in
a
few
minutes
now
the
guide
told
the
professor
and
the
boys
and
i
hope
you
all
will
do
just
as
i
tell
you
you
may
depend
upon
our
doing
exactly
that
answered
the
professor
i
am
going
to
crawl
out
of
here
the
rest
of
you
remain
here
until
i
call
to
you
to
come
out
no
matter
if
it
is
until
morning
after
i
have
been
gone
about
ten
minutes
light
a
match
and
toss
it
into
the
heap
of
sage
there
but
watch
out
that
you
do
get
into
the
light
throw
the
match
you
liable
to
be
shot
if
you
show
yourselves
why
should
we
make
a
fire
and
thus
make
targets
of
ourselves
protested
ned
that
is
to
cover
kringle
retreat
tad
informed
them
exactly
master
tad
you
may
come
along
with
me
if
you
wish
tad
jumped
at
the
offer
but
not
a
sound
ask
me
no
questions
follow
a
rod
or
so
behind
me
and
walk
low
down
all
the
time
if
you
make
a
mistake
it
may
result
seriously
for
you
and
your
friends
and
another
thing
yes
should
there
be
any
shooting
throw
yourself
on
the
ground
you
will
not
be
as
likely
to
be
hit
there
i
obey
orders
sir
i
know
it
when
do
we
start
i
guess
we
can
do
so
now
as
safely
as
at
any
time
the
rascals
will
not
be
likely
to
be
on
the
mountain
just
yet
because
it
is
not
dark
enough
yes
we
go
now
tad
waited
until
kris
kringle
had
crawled
from
the
cave
then
lay
down
on
his
stomach
and
wriggled
out
on
the
ledge
there
were
no
signs
of
the
enemy
and
the
of
the
pony
rider
boys
glowed
dimly
down
below
tad
peering
off
into
the
gloom
for
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
thought
he
saw
a
figure
flit
by
the
fire
he
could
not
be
sure
however
he
wished
he
might
tell
the
guide
of
his
fancied
discovery
but
remembering
the
injunction
for
absolute
silence
he
said
nothing
by
this
time
tad
arms
were
about
the
log
from
the
slight
vibration
he
knew
that
kris
kringle
was
somewhere
between
himself
and
the
top
yet
not
a
sound
did
the
guide
make
tad
made
no
more
and
they
would
have
been
keen
ears
indeed
that
could
have
detected
our
presence
by
sound
alone
when
the
lad
finally
reached
the
top
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
the
touch
gave
him
a
violent
start
in
spite
of
his
steady
nerves
you
all
right
whispered
the
voice
of
kris
kringle
you
make
a
good
indian
i
want
to
explain
something
that
i
did
wish
the
others
to
hear
yes
whispered
tad
i
have
only
one
shell
left
in
my
rifle
that
why
i
wanted
you
to
go
along
if
by
any
chance
the
rascals
should
get
me
you
lie
low
they
make
for
the
cave
as
they
know
by
this
time
that
there
is
only
one
rifle
in
the
party
the
minute
they
do
should
such
an
emergency
arise
slide
for
the
camp
and
get
your
gun
you
know
what
to
do
with
it
it
be
a
case
of
saving
the
lives
of
your
companions
if
it
comes
to
that
i
understand
answered
tad
bravely
and
without
a
quaver
in
his
voice
mind
you
i
do
think
for
a
minute
that
it
will
happen
i
can
handle
these
fellows
if
i
get
the
lay
of
the
land
keep
close
enough
to
hear
me
that
not
so
easy
no
but
you
know
when
i
stop
you
do
the
same
chapter
xix
outwitting
the
redskins
kris
kringle
moved
away
without
another
word
his
abrupt
departure
was
the
signal
for
the
pony
rider
boy
to
start
which
he
did
instantly
in
a
few
minutes
tad
was
skulking
along
the
top
of
the
mountain
when
he
ran
into
the
guide
again
just
then
the
report
of
a
rifle
sounded
down
below
them
are
they
shooting
at
us
whispered
tad
no
the
boys
have
lighted
the
fire
in
the
cave
our
friends
down
below
took
a
pot
shot
at
the
blaze
hope
they
did
hit
anybody
chunky
would
be
the
only
one
to
get
in
the
way
and
i
imagine
the
others
would
hold
him
back
come
this
way
we
go
down
by
a
different
trail
the
redskins
are
watching
the
fire
in
the
cave
but
they
may
be
keeping
an
eye
on
the
trail
at
the
same
time
silently
the
man
and
the
boy
took
their
way
along
the
rough
uneven
path
slowly
working
down
into
the
valley
they
soon
reached
this
for
the
range
was
low
there
reaching
the
foothills
the
two
scouts
once
more
fell
into
single
file
tad
butler
to
the
rear
he
knew
that
the
guide
rifle
ahead
of
him
was
ready
for
instant
use
and
at
any
second
now
tad
expected
to
see
the
flash
of
a
gun
the
lad
was
not
afraid
but
he
was
all
with
excitement
this
stalking
an
enemy
in
the
dark
not
knowing
at
what
minute
that
enemy
might
make
the
attack
was
not
the
same
as
a
fight
in
broad
daylight
tad
wondered
why
the
guide
had
not
permitted
the
rest
of
the
party
to
escape
while
they
had
the
opportunity
he
did
not
know
that
kris
kringle
fully
expected
an
ambush
nor
that
two
would
stand
a
better
chance
to
get
through
and
the
savages
than
would
half
a
dozen
of
them
the
pair
had
approached
nearly
to
the
camp
for
which
the
guide
was
heading
when
suddenly
a
hand
was
laid
on
the
boy
arm
in
a
firm
grip
tad
knew
the
guide
had
seen
or
heard
something
what
is
it
there
in
the
faint
light
of
the
the
lad
gazing
where
kris
kringle
had
pointed
was
astonished
to
see
a
figure
seated
at
their
table
from
his
motions
it
was
evident
that
the
intruder
was
stowing
away
the
stolen
fool
at
a
great
rate
is
that
one
of
them
yes
he
have
indigestion
the
way
he
eating
hope
he
does
swallow
the
dishes
too
i
going
to
find
the
other
one
you
crawl
as
close
to
the
camp
as
you
can
with
safety
if
you
hear
a
disturbance
dive
for
the
tents
the
instant
that
fellow
starts
he
move
if
he
hears
any
noise
get
a
gun
and
hurry
to
me
but
be
quiet
about
it
yes
remember
your
instructions
i
may
be
able
to
handle
both
of
them
but
if
i
do
get
the
missing
one
at
the
first
crack
i
sha
be
able
to
take
care
of
them
both
you
have
to
help
me
got
the
nerve
i
not
afraid
whispered
the
boy
steadily
and
i
got
some
muscle
as
well
that
evident
i
off
now
tad
was
left
alone
this
time
he
could
feel
the
guide
movements
as
the
latter
slipped
away
on
the
soft
earth
but
in
a
moment
all
sound
was
lost
i
think
i
crawl
up
nearer
so
as
to
be
handy
if
anything
occurs
decided
the
lad
creeping
along
on
all
fours
he
could
not
see
the
light
in
the
camp
now
but
he
reasoned
that
the
man
at
the
table
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
it
as
near
as
tad
could
judge
of
direction
in
the
dark
the
indian
seemed
not
to
fear
a
surprise
that
what
comes
from
overconfidence
grinned
the
lad
i
wish
i
had
something
to
defend
myself
with
he
added
after
a
pause
tad
had
no
sooner
expressed
his
wish
than
his
fingers
closed
over
some
object
on
the
ground
he
grasped
it
with
about
the
same
hopefulness
that
a
dying
man
will
grasp
at
a
straw
what
he
had
found
was
a
heavy
tent
stake
one
that
kris
kringle
had
dropped
from
his
bundle
on
the
way
to
the
cliff
dweller
home
the
lad
breathed
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
and
crept
on
with
renewed
courage
he
proceeded
as
far
as
he
dared
then
lay
still
listening
for
the
noise
of
the
expected
conflict
between
the
guide
and
the
other
red
man
it
came
the
sound
was
like
that
of
a
body
falling
heavily
once
more
the
indian
at
the
table
turned
his
head
listening
inquiringly
he
made
a
half
motion
to
rise
glanced
at
the
table
then
sat
down
again
and
began
to
eat
his
appetite
has
overcome
his
judgment
grinned
tad
the
lad
could
hear
the
faint
sound
of
conflict
somewhere
to
the
rear
of
him
he
was
getting
uneasy
and
began
to
fidget
all
at
once
the
red
man
sprang
up
starting
on
a
run
trailing
rifle
behind
him
he
was
headed
directly
for
the
place
where
tad
lay
flattened
on
the
ground
though
the
lad
felt
sure
his
enemy
did
not
see
him
but
when
the
indian
suddenly
sprang
up
into
the
air
to
avoid
stepping
on
the
object
that
lay
there
tad
knew
that
further
secrecy
was
useless
the
redskin
had
jumped
right
over
him
dropping
rifle
as
he
leaped
the
gun
fell
on
the
pony
rider
boy
and
for
a
second
hindered
his
movements
but
tad
was
up
like
a
flash
while
the
indian
whirled
no
less
quickly
knife
unsheathed
ready
for
battle
this
was
where
tad
tent
stake
came
in
handy
without
it
he
would
have
been
in
a
much
more
serious
fix
it
was
bad
enough
as
it
was
without
an
instant
hesitation
the
lad
brought
the
stake
down
on
the
wrist
of
the
hand
that
held
the
knife
the
knife
fell
to
the
ground
while
the
indian
with
a
howl
sprang
at
the
slender
lad
though
the
fellow
wrist
was
useless
at
that
moment
he
was
as
full
of
fight
as
ever
tad
stepped
nimbly
aside
and
tried
to
trip
his
adversary
but
the
indian
was
too
sharp
to
be
caught
that
way
if
he
ever
gets
those
arms
around
me
i
a
goner
thought
tad
taking
mental
measure
of
his
antagonist
suddenly
the
indian
swooped
down
making
a
grab
for
the
rifle
that
he
had
dropped
as
the
redskin
stooped
tad
hit
him
a
wallop
on
the
head
with
the
tent
stake
it
must
have
made
the
savage
see
a
shower
of
stars
at
least
it
staggered
him
so
he
was
glad
to
let
the
weapon
remain
where
it
was
for
a
few
seconds
the
air
was
full
of
flying
legs
and
arms
during
which
the
boy
landed
three
times
on
the
red
man
being
himself
unhurt
then
the
indian
succeeded
in
rushing
into
a
clinch
and
tad
found
himself
gripped
in
those
arms
of
steel
wriggle
and
twist
as
he
would
he
could
not
free
himself
from
their
embrace
his
adversary
on
the
other
hand
found
himself
fully
occupied
in
holding
on
to
his
slippery
young
antagonist
giving
him
neither
time
nor
opportunity
effectually
to
dispose
of
the
slender
lad
tad
was
unusually
muscular
for
his
years
to
which
was
added
no
little
skill
as
wrestler
the
indian
soon
discovered
both
these
qualities
and
at
about
that
time
the
lad
was
resorting
to
every
trick
he
knew
to
place
the
indian
in
a
position
where
he
could
be
thrown
the
moment
came
with
disconcerting
suddenness
and
redman
uttered
a
loud
grunt
as
he
landed
on
the
ground
flat
on
his
back
with
a
spring
he
lifted
himself
up
and
the
next
instant
he
had
thrown
the
slight
figure
of
the
pony
rider
boy
so
heavily
that
everything
about
tad
grew
black
he
felt
himself
going
then
all
at
once
he
lost
consciousness
when
finally
he
awakened
tad
found
a
figure
still
bending
over
him
quick
as
a
flash
the
boy
arms
went
up
encircling
the
neck
of
the
man
kneeling
by
him
the
next
instant
the
fellow
was
on
his
back
with
tad
sitting
on
his
chest
here
here
what
the
matter
with
you
gasped
a
muffled
voice
which
tad
instantly
recognized
kris
kringle
he
gasped
yes
and
you
nearly
knocked
the
breath
out
of
me
grinned
the
guide
struggling
to
his
feet
well
you
certainly
are
a
whirlwind
i
i
thought
you
were
the
indian
mattered
tad
in
a
sheepish
tone
if
it
had
been
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
my
interference
where
is
he
over
there
tied
up
both
of
them
are
we
decide
what
to
do
with
them
when
we
get
the
party
together
tell
me
what
happened
begged
tad
the
other
fellow
was
so
busy
watching
the
cave
that
he
forgot
to
keep
his
ears
open
i
was
able
to
approach
him
without
being
detected
when
i
got
near
enough
i
laid
the
butt
of
my
rifle
over
his
head
no
i
did
hurt
him
much
just
made
him
curl
up
on
the
ground
long
enough
to
enable
me
to
tie
his
hands
and
feet
about
that
time
i
caught
the
sound
of
something
going
on
over
here
i
made
a
run
suspecting
that
you
were
mixing
it
up
with
the
other
redskin
guess
i
was
just
in
time
too
for
he
had
you
down
and
was
reaching
for
something
his
knife
nodded
tad
it
somewhere
around
here
now
well
i
gave
him
the
same
medicine
that
i
had
given
the
other
now
we
better
go
and
call
the
others
thank
you
i
have
been
in
a
bad
fix
if
you
had
come
as
you
did
so
might
i
had
you
not
stopped
the
second
one
we
quits
then
said
the
guide
extending
his
hand
which
tad
grasped
warmly
i
call
the
others
if
you
wish
yes
tad
ran
over
to
the
base
of
the
cliff
and
shouted
loudly
for
his
companions
in
half
an
hour
the
party
had
gathered
about
the
camp
fire
engaged
in
an
animated
discussion
over
the
stirring
experiences
of
the
evening
it
was
decided
that
the
indians
should
be
placed
on
their
ponies
to
which
they
were
to
be
tied
with
hands
free
and
provisions
enough
to
last
them
until
they
reached
their
reservation
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
the
guide
restored
their
rifles
to
them
after
first
taking
their
ammunition
and
transferring
it
to
his
own
kit
i
wasted
nearly
that
much
on
you
he
said
and
if
ever
you
ride
across
my
trail
again
i
use
your
own
lead
on
you
in
a
way
that
will
stop
you
you
wo
need
bullets
like
these
in
the
happy
hunting
grounds
where
you
be
going
now
git
and
they
did
the
redskins
rode
as
if
a
ghost
were
pursuing
them
that
the
last
we
shall
see
of
those
gentlemen
laughed
kris
kringle
morning
we
shall
be
on
our
way
in
peace
but
the
trail
of
the
pony
rider
boys
was
not
to
be
all
peace
before
them
ere
they
reached
the
end
of
the
silver
trail
they
were
to
find
other
thrilling
experiences
awaiting
them
chapter
xx
tilting
for
the
silver
spurs
their
journey
led
the
young
horsemen
across
the
plains
over
ranges
across
broad
barren
and
down
through
the
bottom
lands
until
the
wide
sweep
of
the
rio
grande
river
at
last
lay
before
them
after
the
weeks
of
arid
landscape
the
sight
of
water
and
so
much
of
it
brought
a
loud
cheer
from
the
pony
rider
boys
the
next
thing
was
to
find
a
fording
place
this
they
did
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
and
their
further
journey
took
them
to
the
little
desert
town
of
puraje
they
camped
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
here
where
we
get
a
real
bath
who
going
in
swimming
with
me
asked
tad
i
am
shouted
all
the
boys
at
once
the
professor
and
kris
kringle
concluded
that
they
too
would
take
a
dip
and
a
merry
hour
was
spent
in
a
protected
cove
of
the
big
river
where
the
boys
proved
themselves
as
much
at
home
as
they
were
in
the
saddle
in
the
evening
they
purchased
such
supplies
as
the
town
afforded
the
night
passed
disturbance
the
boys
taking
up
their
journey
next
morning
before
the
sleepy
town
had
awakened
it
was
a
week
later
when
tired
and
dusty
the
outfit
pulled
up
at
la
luz
a
quaint
hamlet
nestling
in
the
foothills
of
the
sacramento
mountains
the
place
they
found
to
be
largely
mexican
and
it
was
almost
as
if
the
visitors
had
slipped
over
the
border
to
find
themselves
in
mexico
itself
decorations
were
in
evidence
on
all
sides
mantillas
indian
blankets
and
flags
were
everywhere
hello
i
guess
something
is
going
on
here
laughed
tad
we
are
in
time
whatever
it
is
nodded
the
guide
probably
it
a
feast
of
some
kind
you
will
be
interested
in
it
if
that
is
what
it
is
the
feast
they
learned
was
to
be
celebrated
on
the
morrow
with
games
feats
of
strength
and
horsemanship
do
you
think
they
will
let
us
take
part
asked
tad
as
the
party
made
camp
in
the
yard
of
a
little
adobe
church
where
they
had
obtained
permission
to
camp
i
see
about
it
answered
the
guide
there
may
be
reasons
why
it
would
not
be
best
to
do
so
maybe
i
can
win
another
rifle
suggested
chunky
these
people
do
give
away
rifles
they
too
too
what
do
you
call
it
too
artistic
that
it
the
camp
being
on
the
main
street
of
the
village
attracted
no
little
attention
after
sundown
crowds
of
gayly
bedecked
young
people
strolled
up
and
stood
about
the
church
yard
watching
the
american
boys
pitching
their
tents
and
preparing
for
their
stay
over
night
the
villagers
were
especially
interested
in
watching
the
boys
get
their
supper
which
was
served
up
steaming
hot
within
fifteen
minutes
after
preparations
had
begun
chunky
had
bought
several
pies
at
the
store
which
with
a
pound
of
cheese
brought
in
by
ned
made
a
pleasant
change
in
the
daily
routine
chunky
started
in
on
the
pie
ned
calmly
reached
over
and
took
it
away
from
him
then
the
supper
went
along
until
it
came
time
for
the
dessert
when
chunky
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
cheese
suspiciously
see
anything
wrong
with
that
cheese
demanded
ned
no
but
i
got
an
idea
out
with
it
you
wo
rest
easy
until
you
do
what
your
idea
i
was
thinking
if
i
had
a
camera
i
could
make
a
motion
picture
of
that
cheese
i
heard
of
a
fellow
once
that
will
do
master
stacy
warned
professor
zepplin
ca
i
talk
along
proper
lines
yes
cheese
is
proper
is
it
depends
upon
how
old
it
is
chuckled
tad
you
need
make
fun
of
my
cheese
here
give
it
to
me
i
eat
it
you
welcome
to
it
ned
laughed
the
boys
the
fun
went
on
much
to
the
amusement
of
the
villagers
who
remained
near
by
until
the
evening
was
well
along
and
the
lads
began
preparing
for
bed
next
morning
the
visitors
began
coming
in
to
town
early
there
were
men
from
the
ranches
mexican
arrayed
in
bright
colors
and
displaying
expensive
saddle
trimmings
there
were
others
from
the
wild
places
on
the
desert
far
beyond
the
water
limits
whose
means
of
livelihood
were
known
only
to
themselves
it
was
a
strange
company
and
one
that
appealed
considerably
to
the
curiosity
of
the
pony
rider
boys
the
early
part
of
the
day
was
given
over
to
racing
roping
gambling
and
other
sports
in
which
the
lads
were
content
to
take
no
part
but
there
was
an
event
scheduled
for
the
afternoon
that
interested
tad
more
than
all
the
rest
that
was
a
tilting
bout
open
to
all
comers
a
tilting
arch
had
been
erected
in
the
middle
of
the
main
street
and
had
been
decorated
with
flags
and
greens
the
tilting
ring
suspended
from
the
top
of
the
arch
was
not
more
than
an
inch
in
diameter
the
horseman
who
could
impale
it
on
his
tilting
peg
and
carry
the
ring
away
with
him
the
greatest
number
of
times
would
be
declared
the
winner
each
one
was
to
be
given
five
chances
the
prize
a
pair
of
silver
spurs
was
to
be
presented
by
the
belle
of
the
town
a
señorita
the
guide
had
entered
tad
in
this
contest
but
as
the
lad
glanced
up
at
the
ring
only
an
inch
in
diameter
he
grew
rather
dubious
he
never
had
seen
any
tilting
and
did
not
even
know
how
the
sport
was
conducted
kris
kringle
gave
the
lad
some
instructions
about
the
method
employed
by
the
tilters
and
tad
decided
to
enter
the
contest
only
ten
horsemen
entered
most
of
these
being
either
mexicans
or
halfbreeds
the
first
trial
over
five
of
the
contestants
had
succeeded
in
carrying
away
the
ring
tad
had
waited
until
nearly
the
last
in
order
to
get
all
the
information
possible
as
to
the
way
the
rest
of
the
contestants
played
the
game
a
pole
had
been
loaned
to
him
or
rather
a
peg
they
called
it
eight
feet
long
tapered
so
as
to
allow
it
to
go
through
the
brass
ring
for
fully
two
feet
of
its
length
the
pony
rider
boy
took
his
place
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
without
the
least
hesitancy
galloped
down
toward
the
ring
which
indeed
he
could
not
even
see
when
within
a
few
feet
of
the
arch
he
caught
the
sparkle
of
the
ring
his
lance
came
up
and
putting
spurs
to
his
broncho
he
shot
under
the
arch
driving
the
point
of
the
peg
full
at
the
slender
circle
the
point
struck
the
edge
sending
the
ring
swaying
like
the
pendulum
of
a
clock
a
howl
greeted
his
achievement
tad
said
nothing
but
riding
slowly
back
awaited
his
next
trial
the
rule
was
that
when
one
of
the
contestants
made
a
strike
he
was
to
continue
until
he
failed
he
would
be
allowed
to
run
out
five
points
in
succession
if
he
could
rest
the
peg
against
your
side
and
lightly
advised
a
man
as
tad
turned
into
the
street
for
another
try
the
man
was
past
middle
age
and
though
dressed
in
the
garb
of
a
man
of
the
plains
tad
decided
at
once
that
he
was
not
of
the
same
type
as
most
of
the
motley
mob
by
which
he
was
surrounded
the
lad
nodded
his
understanding
with
a
sharp
little
cry
of
warning
the
boy
put
spurs
to
his
pony
he
fairly
flew
down
the
course
no
such
speed
had
been
seen
there
that
day
the
northern
bronchos
that
the
boys
were
riding
were
built
for
faster
work
and
possessed
more
spirit
than
their
brothers
of
the
desert
as
he
neared
the
arch
this
time
the
lad
half
rose
in
his
stirrups
he
knew
where
to
look
for
the
ring
now
leaning
slightly
forward
he
let
the
point
of
the
peg
tilt
ever
so
little
it
went
through
the
ring
tearing
it
from
its
slender
fastening
and
carrying
it
away
loud
shouts
of
approval
greeted
his
achievement
once
more
he
raced
down
the
lane
this
time
at
so
fast
a
clip
that
the
faces
of
the
spectators
who
lined
the
course
were
a
mere
blur
in
his
eyes
he
felt
the
slight
jar
and
heard
the
click
as
the
ring
slipped
over
the
tilting
peg
two
announced
the
scorer
he
missed
the
next
one
then
the
others
took
their
turn
only
one
of
these
succeeded
in
scoring
he
was
one
of
the
mexicans
who
made
such
a
brave
show
of
color
in
raiment
and
saddle
cloth
that
gives
the
señor
and
the
boy
three
apiece
each
has
one
turn
left
the
others
will
fall
out
if
neither
scores
in
his
turn
both
will
be
ruled
out
and
the
others
will
compete
for
the
prize
announced
the
scorer
the
mexican
smiled
a
supercilious
smile
as
much
as
to
say
the
idea
of
a
boy
defeating
me
the
mexican
was
an
expert
at
the
game
of
tilting
as
it
was
practised
on
the
desert
the
man
took
the
first
turn
he
sat
quietly
on
his
pony
a
moment
before
starting
placing
the
lance
at
just
the
proper
angle
then
galloped
at
the
mark
he
too
rose
in
his
stirrups
the
spectators
were
silent
the
ring
just
missed
being
impaled
on
the
tilting
peg
slipping
along
the
pole
half
way
then
bounding
up
into
the
air
the
spectators
groaned
the
mexican
had
lost
now
it
was
tad
turn
he
rode
as
if
it
were
an
everyday
occurrence
with
him
to
tilt
only
he
went
at
it
with
a
rash
that
fairly
took
their
breath
away
just
as
he
was
about
to
drive
at
the
ring
some
one
uttered
a
wild
yell
and
a
sombrero
hurled
from
the
crowd
struck
tad
fairly
across
the
eyes
of
course
he
lost
and
for
a
moment
he
could
not
see
a
thing
he
pulled
his
pony
to
a
quick
stop
and
sat
rubbing
and
blinking
his
smarting
eyes
a
howl
of
disapproval
went
up
from
the
spectators
none
seemed
to
know
whether
the
act
had
been
inspired
by
enthusiasm
or
malice
tad
was
convinced
that
it
was
the
latter
his
face
was
flushed
but
the
lad
made
no
comment
you
are
entitled
to
another
tilt
called
the
scorer
to
this
the
mexican
objected
loudly
under
the
circumstances
as
my
opponent
objects
and
as
we
all
wish
to
prevent
hard
feelings
why
not
give
him
a
chance
as
well
if
he
wins
i
shall
be
satisfied
a
shout
of
approval
greeted
tad
suggestion
this
was
the
real
spirit
and
it
appealed
to
them
the
proposition
was
agreed
to
but
again
the
mexican
lost
if
the
young
man
is
interfered
with
this
time
i
shall
award
the
prize
to
him
and
end
the
tournament
warned
the
scorer
though
tad
eyes
were
smarting
from
the
blow
of
the
sombrero
he
allowed
the
eyelids
to
droop
well
over
them
thus
protecting
them
from
the
dust
and
at
the
same
time
giving
him
a
clearer
vision
on
his
next
turn
tad
tore
down
the
narrow
lane
he
shot
between
the
posts
like
an
arrow
and
the
tilting
peg
was
driven
far
into
the
narrow
hoop
wedging
the
ring
on
so
firmly
that
it
afterwards
required
force
to
loosen
and
remove
it
without
halting
his
pony
tad
rode
on
out
a
circle
and
came
back
at
a
lively
gallop
pulling
up
before
the
stand
of
dry
goods
boxes
where
the
young
woman
who
was
to
award
the
prize
stood
swinging
her
handkerchief
while
the
spectators
set
up
a
deafening
roar
of
applause
tad
was
holding
the
tilting
peg
aloft
displaying
the
ring
wedged
on
it
he
made
the
young
woman
a
sweeping
bow
his
sombrero
almost
touching
the
ground
as
he
did
so
another
shout
went
up
when
the
handsome
spurs
were
handed
to
him
which
the
enthusiastic
young
woman
first
wrapped
in
her
own
handkerchief
before
passing
the
prize
over
to
him
and
amid
the
din
tad
heard
the
familiar
oh
wow
wow
in
the
shrill
voice
of
stacy
brown
chapter
xxi
the
fat
boy
discovery
i
saw
him
i
saw
him
tad
saw
who
chunky
i
tell
you
i
did
do
you
i
know
what
my
eyes
tell
me
in
confidence
do
you
to
go
to
contradicting
to
me
stacy
had
fairly
overwhelmed
tad
butler
with
the
importance
of
his
discovery
but
thus
far
tad
had
not
the
least
idea
what
it
was
all
about
when
you
get
quieted
down
perhaps
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
who
it
is
you
saw
the
man
the
man
humph
that
about
as
clear
as
the
water
in
an
alkali
sink
what
man
the
one
we
saw
on
the
train
do
you
know
tad
thought
a
moment
you
mean
the
one
we
heard
talking
just
before
we
got
to
bluewater
butler
had
entirely
forgotten
the
incident
yes
that
him
that
him
exploded
stacy
you
say
that
fellow
lasar
that
his
name
is
he
here
where
he
got
off
the
stage
down
by
the
postoffice
just
when
i
was
coming
up
here
was
he
alone
the
other
fellow
was
with
him
if
that
what
you
mean
yes
tad
went
over
in
his
mind
the
conversation
the
man
lasar
had
held
with
his
companion
in
which
the
pair
were
plotting
against
some
one
by
the
name
of
marquand
oh
well
chunky
it
none
of
our
concern
i
think
we
must
have
magnified
the
incident
i
he
bear
watching
tad
he
will
and
it
muh
muh
you
understand
who
going
to
do
it
declared
chunky
swelling
out
his
chest
and
tapping
it
with
his
right
fist
all
right
go
ahead
laughed
tad
it
time
some
of
us
get
into
more
trouble
the
professor
will
begin
to
think
we
got
a
fever
or
something
if
we
let
two
days
in
succession
pass
without
stirring
up
something
i
got
an
idea
exploded
stacy
there
you
go
it
coming
now
i
go
tell
the
policeman
why
you
ninny
there
are
no
policemen
here
perhaps
there
is
a
sheriff
hello
here
comes
the
gentleman
who
gave
me
the
advice
that
helped
me
to
win
those
handsome
spurs
he
introducing
himself
to
the
professor
and
kringle
let
go
over
forgetting
for
the
moment
the
subject
they
were
discussing
tad
and
stacy
strolled
over
to
the
o
tad
this
is
marquand
james
marquand
from
albuquerque
he
wants
to
know
you
and
this
is
another
one
of
our
pony
rider
boys
master
stacy
brown
said
the
professor
presenting
his
boys
marquand
exclaimed
both
boys
under
their
breaths
i
am
glad
to
know
you
master
butler
that
was
a
very
fine
piece
of
work
you
did
this
afternoon
you
steady
nerves
if
there
any
credit
due
it
is
to
you
your
suggestion
helped
me
to
win
the
prize
without
it
i
should
have
failed
answered
tad
generously
which
way
are
you
headed
asked
marquand
guadalupes
answered
the
guide
the
boys
want
to
explore
some
of
the
old
pueblos
and
i
also
spoke
up
professor
zepplin
i
understand
there
is
much
of
interest
in
them
i
should
say
so
muttered
their
guest
i
like
a
few
moments
to
speak
with
you
in
private
if
you
can
spare
the
time
said
tad
in
a
low
voice
at
the
first
opportunity
at
your
service
now
sir
no
not
here
then
come
to
my
room
at
the
hotel
i
fix
it
with
the
others
said
marquand
observing
at
once
that
the
lad
had
some
serious
purpose
in
mind
my
friend
chunky
will
go
with
me
if
agreeable
to
you
that
all
right
professor
if
you
have
no
objection
i
should
like
to
have
these
two
young
men
go
to
my
quarters
with
me
for
a
little
while
i
certainly
do
stay
out
too
late
boys
no
sir
wonder
what
they
got
up
their
sleeves
muttered
ned
watching
the
receding
figures
of
his
two
companions
and
marquand
you
may
talk
smiled
the
latter
after
they
were
well
started
i
rather
not
until
we
are
where
we
shall
not
be
overheard
answered
tad
promptly
all
three
fell
silent
the
boys
followed
their
host
to
his
room
apparently
without
having
been
observed
the
little
village
was
too
full
of
its
own
pleasures
to
notice
be
seated
boys
i
take
for
granted
that
neither
of
you
smoke
oh
no
sir
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
am
sure
you
have
something
of
importance
to
yourselves
on
your
minds
not
to
us
specially
perhaps
to
you
though
replied
tad
indeed
we
may
be
foolish
if
so
you
will
understand
that
we
have
no
motive
beyond
a
desire
to
serve
you
that
goes
without
saying
do
you
know
a
man
by
the
name
of
lasar
bob
lasar
mr
marquand
marquand
started
eyeing
both
lads
questioningly
yes
he
is
associated
with
me
in
a
business
venture
told
you
so
interjected
stacy
what
of
him
tad
wished
he
was
well
out
of
it
all
to
be
obliged
to
tell
all
he
knew
of
bob
lasar
and
to
the
latter
partner
was
rather
a
troublesome
undertaking
plucking
up
courage
tad
briefly
related
all
that
he
and
his
companion
had
overheard
on
the
train
as
they
were
approaching
bluewater
to
all
of
which
their
host
listened
with
grave
attention
and
increasing
interest
the
incident
probably
would
not
have
come
back
to
me
again
but
for
certain
things
that
happened
tad
continued
would
either
of
you
know
lasar
were
you
to
see
him
again
do
you
think
my
friend
chunky
brown
saw
him
here
saw
him
get
out
of
the
stage
in
front
of
this
very
hotel
nodded
stacy
you
are
right
he
is
here
lasar
had
stopped
off
at
a
town
on
a
personal
matter
can
you
describe
the
man
whom
you
saw
with
him
on
the
train
as
i
remember
him
he
was
slightly
taller
than
lasar
with
red
hair
and
a
moustache
of
the
same
shade
yes
that
joe
comstock
no
doubt
about
that
nodded
marquand
you
did
hear
them
say
what
their
plan
was
then
not
definitely
only
that
they
intended
to
rid
themselves
of
you
after
having
obtained
possession
of
your
plans
for
finding
the
treasure
or
at
least
learning
where
it
is
hidden
marquand
sat
thoughtfully
silent
for
several
minutes
the
lines
of
his
face
growing
tense
and
hard
the
boys
could
see
that
he
was
exerting
a
strong
effort
to
control
himself
you
you
have
told
them
your
plans
questioned
tad
in
a
subdued
voice
no
i
was
going
to
do
so
if
comstock
had
arrived
he
may
get
in
yet
but
you
wo
do
so
now
will
you
no
i
thank
you
boys
exclaimed
their
host
extending
an
impulsive
hand
to
each
at
the
same
time
then
then
our
information
is
going
to
be
of
some
use
to
you
more
than
you
can
have
any
idea
of
you
have
done
me
a
greater
service
than
you
know
i
thank
you
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
perhaps
ere
long
i
may
be
able
to
show
my
appreciation
in
a
more
substantial
manner
marquand
ceased
speaking
abruptly
and
began
pacing
back
and
forth
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
coat
pockets
he
was
a
man
of
slight
build
but
strong
and
wiry
he
was
well
past
middle
age
erect
and
forceful
looking
at
him
tad
found
himself
wondering
how
such
a
man
could
have
gotten
into
the
clutches
of
two
such
rascals
as
bob
lasar
and
joe
comstock
tad
hoped
their
host
would
offer
some
explanation
while
chunky
was
nearly
bursting
with
curiosity
marquand
appeared
to
have
forgotten
their
presence
entirely
i
think
we
had
better
be
going
now
suggested
tad
rising
wait
commanded
their
host
sit
down
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
then
perhaps
i
walk
back
to
your
camp
and
have
a
talk
with
the
professor
what
sort
of
man
is
your
guide
he
a
very
fine
man
that
my
idea
what
you
heard
on
the
train
is
borne
out
by
several
little
things
that
have
come
under
my
observation
within
the
last
few
days
but
i
did
not
think
they
would
go
as
far
as
you
have
indicated
i
will
tell
you
frankly
that
i
expect
the
treasure
which
we
hope
to
find
to
be
a
big
one
how
i
happened
to
take
these
men
in
with
me
in
the
search
for
it
is
unnecessary
to
state
however
i
am
done
with
them
now
for
good
they
know
that
i
have
not
put
my
information
on
paper
or
else
they
might
have
made
an
end
of
me
before
this
is
the
treasure
near
this
vicinity
mr
marquand
asked
tad
about
two
days
journey
i
expect
to
find
it
at
or
near
the
ruins
of
an
old
pueblo
house
you
know
they
built
their
homes
one
on
top
of
another
some
of
their
adobe
houses
are
six
and
seven
stories
high
even
if
we
locate
the
place
we
may
experience
great
difficulty
in
finding
that
of
which
we
are
in
search
how
would
you
boys
like
to
join
me
it
will
be
an
interesting
experience
for
you
help
help
you
find
the
buried
treasure
questioned
chunky
his
face
red
with
suppressed
excitement
yes
great
chorused
the
lads
i
talk
with
professor
zepplin
come
we
will
go
over
to
the
camp
now
when
marquand
and
the
professor
had
finished
their
conference
tad
and
chunky
leaned
forward
eagerly
to
learn
the
result
yes
nodded
marquand
you
all
going
to
help
me
find
the
ancient
pueblo
treasure
chapter
xxii
in
conflict
i
done
with
you
bob
lasar
and
you
too
comstock
thundered
marquand
as
the
rascals
stood
at
the
door
of
his
room
some
two
hours
later
marquand
had
been
waiting
for
them
and
with
him
was
tad
butler
whom
he
had
urged
to
accompany
him
back
to
the
hotel
that
he
might
be
a
witness
to
what
took
place
perhaps
too
marquand
reasoned
that
his
former
associates
might
not
take
the
same
attitude
toward
him
in
the
presence
of
the
boy
that
they
might
otherwise
take
the
two
men
had
halted
in
the
doorway
as
marquand
hurled
his
decision
at
them
lasar
shoved
his
companion
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
sit
down
both
of
you
so
you
thought
to
hoodwink
me
to
get
the
secret
of
the
treasure
and
then
put
me
out
of
the
way
eh
that
was
your
game
was
it
well
it
all
off
now
i
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
you
why
why
marquand
it
all
a
mistake
began
one
of
the
pair
perhaps
you
deny
having
plotted
against
me
on
a
train
on
your
way
to
bluewater
i
deny
ever
having
tried
to
put
up
a
game
on
master
tad
did
you
ever
see
these
men
before
they
turned
on
the
lad
quickly
neither
man
had
previously
observed
him
yes
sir
where
on
the
train
as
you
mentioned
just
now
and
they
were
plotting
my
life
so
it
seemed
to
me
sir
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
demanded
marquand
that
the
boy
lies
tad
face
flushed
angrily
that
do
said
marquand
more
quietly
then
you
believe
him
you
do
not
believe
me
i
believe
him
i
know
he
has
told
me
the
truth
now
it
necessary
to
explain
to
you
you
deserve
no
explanation
and
you
get
none
further
than
what
you
already
have
but
no
about
it
i
said
i
was
done
with
you
now
i
want
you
to
get
out
of
my
sight
you
a
couple
of
rogues
so
crooked
that
you
ca
walk
straight
bob
lasar
face
had
grown
livid
with
rage
his
anger
was
rapidly
getting
beyond
all
bounds
tad
observed
it
and
saw
the
storm
coming
it
arrived
a
moment
later
when
lasar
whipped
out
a
revolver
before
marquand
could
make
a
move
to
draw
his
own
weapon
bob
had
aimed
his
weapon
and
pulled
the
trigger
tad
instantly
divining
the
purpose
of
the
man
when
he
saw
his
hand
fly
to
the
pistol
holster
under
his
coat
sprang
forward
there
was
a
deafening
report
a
bullet
buried
itself
in
the
ceiling
of
the
room
tad
had
struck
up
the
desperado
arm
just
in
the
nick
of
time
thus
preventing
a
terrible
crime
but
the
end
was
not
yet
there
were
five
more
bullets
in
the
cylinder
of
the
weapon
as
the
lad
knew
full
well
he
grabbed
lasar
arm
hanging
on
desperately
at
the
same
time
trying
to
get
a
wrestling
hold
the
weapon
went
off
again
this
time
sending
a
bullet
into
the
floor
look
out
for
the
other
fellow
shouted
tad
marquand
already
had
done
so
comstock
had
just
made
an
attempt
to
draw
his
own
weapon
when
marquand
threw
himself
upon
the
man
the
two
went
crashing
to
the
floor
while
tad
and
lasar
were
battling
all
over
the
room
the
latter
weapon
barking
viciously
every
little
while
lasar
was
much
more
powerful
than
his
slender
antagonist
but
tad
being
very
quick
on
his
feet
managed
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
revolver
and
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
being
thrown
suddenly
the
boy
gave
the
of
his
opponent
a
quick
twist
lasar
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
of
pain
the
revolver
clattered
to
the
floor
quick
as
a
flash
tad
threw
a
leg
behind
the
knee
of
his
antagonist
gave
it
a
quick
jerk
with
the
result
that
lasar
went
to
the
floor
with
great
violence
by
this
time
occupants
of
the
hotel
were
running
down
the
hall
while
others
were
hammering
at
the
door
lasar
had
turned
the
key
upon
entering
the
room
those
within
did
not
have
time
to
listen
to
the
demands
of
those
in
the
hall
who
were
demanding
admission
marquand
as
soon
as
he
got
his
opponent
down
quickly
disarmed
him
get
up
he
commanded
i
do
want
to
kill
you
i
ought
to
do
so
but
i
wo
he
sprang
from
comstock
and
jerking
tad
from
lasar
whom
the
lad
was
making
heroic
efforts
to
hold
down
pulled
the
fallen
rascal
to
his
feet
get
out
both
of
you
he
commanded
covering
both
his
visitors
with
his
weapon
lasar
in
struggling
to
his
feet
reached
for
his
revolver
drop
it
or
i
fill
you
full
of
lead
at
that
instant
the
door
burst
open
and
half
a
dozen
men
sprang
into
the
room
lasar
seeing
that
he
was
caught
leaped
through
the
open
window
he
was
followed
closely
by
comstock
he
too
made
a
clean
leap
landing
on
the
soft
ground
below
what
the
meaning
of
this
shooting
shouted
the
proprietor
his
face
flushed
with
anger
two
men
tried
to
murder
me
replied
marquand
coolly
it
looks
as
though
you
were
doing
your
share
of
it
snapped
the
proprietor
noting
his
guest
belligerent
attitude
and
drawn
weapon
just
then
three
shots
in
quick
succession
were
fired
from
the
outside
two
of
the
bullets
narrowly
missed
some
of
the
men
who
had
forced
their
way
into
the
room
as
the
third
shot
was
fired
tad
threw
one
hand
to
his
head
then
drew
it
away
grinning
those
rascals
have
evidently
gotten
a
new
supply
of
fire
arms
he
said
a
bullet
had
gone
through
his
hair
and
his
scalp
burned
where
the
lead
had
brushed
it
all
of
the
newcomers
drew
their
revolvers
and
sprang
to
the
window
do
shoot
cried
the
pony
rider
boy
you
hit
the
wrong
one
there
are
a
hundred
people
down
there
he
right
shouted
marquand
pushing
his
way
between
the
men
and
the
window
at
the
imminent
risk
of
getting
a
bullet
in
his
back
from
either
lasar
or
comstock
let
go
they
be
running
for
home
about
this
time
they
are
a
couple
of
scoundrels
sir
but
the
damage
look
at
my
fine
room
i
pay
for
the
damage
and
i
quit
your
hotel
now
i
had
enough
of
the
place
retorted
marquand
pulling
a
roll
of
bills
from
his
pocket
how
much
is
it
well
you
see
how
much
is
it
well
i
guess
would
be
about
right
you
see
here
your
clear
out
with
many
apologies
the
proprietor
accompanied
by
the
others
backed
from
the
room
we
came
pretty
near
having
a
fight
did
we
marquand
smiled
looking
at
tad
for
the
first
time
since
the
disturbance
began
almost
he
would
have
got
me
if
you
had
knocked
up
his
another
one
i
owe
you
well
maybe
we
have
a
pay
day
soon
you
had
better
go
back
to
camp
with
me
and
bunk
in
with
us
suggested
the
lad
we
shall
want
to
make
an
early
start
in
the
morning
anyway
i
think
it
will
be
safer
there
too
that
pair
wo
dare
come
fooling
around
our
camp
knowing
they
ca
trifle
with
us
added
the
lad
with
a
note
of
pride
in
his
tone
i
do
it
not
that
i
afraid
of
anything
that
walks
on
two
legs
but
the
sooner
we
hitch
up
the
better
it
be
got
room
enough
plenty
where
your
pony
up
near
your
camp
come
on
the
man
and
the
boy
walked
from
the
hotel
the
former
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
tad
observing
their
surroundings
half
suspiciously
he
was
sure
they
had
not
yet
heard
the
last
of
bob
lasar
and
joe
comstock
in
this
he
was
right
marquand
and
the
boy
had
gone
no
more
than
ten
rods
from
the
hotel
when
the
report
of
a
revolver
was
heard
and
a
bullet
fired
from
the
corner
of
an
adobe
building
passed
within
an
inch
of
head
with
wonderful
quickness
the
latter
drew
and
sent
three
shots
at
the
flash
whether
he
had
hit
any
thing
or
not
he
did
not
know
run
i
do
want
you
to
get
hit
cried
the
boy
new
friend
grasping
tad
by
the
hand
and
starting
off
at
a
brisk
pace
bullets
do
scare
me
so
long
as
they
do
hit
me
laughed

the

will
be
here
in
a
moment
what
was
it
the
old
pueblo
chief
said
mr
marquand
the
full
of
the
moon
has
come
and
shoots
its
first
arrow
over
the
crests
of
the
guadalupes
it
points
the
way
to
the
treasure
of
my
ancient
people
quoted
marquand
i
presume
that
would
be
taken
to
mean
that
at
a
certain
phase
of
the
moon
one
of
its
beams
points
to
where
the
treasure
is
hidden
explained
professor
zepplin
but
what
leads
you
to
believe
this
is
the
pueblo
village
of
your
particular
chief
ancestors
yes
i
do
see
why
it
might
not
be
any
of
the
ruined
adobe
houses
in
this
valley
said
ned
rector
they
had
journeyed
rapidly
over
mountain
and
plain
to
the
valley
of
the
guadalupes
where
marquand
had
informed
them
that
he
expected
to
find
the
treasure
in
the
three
days
consumed
on
the
journey
the
travelers
had
seen
nothing
of
either
lasar
or
comstock
evidently
the
pair
had
decided
to
leave
the
country
while
they
still
had
the
chance
fearing
that
perhaps
marquand
might
invoke
the
aid
of
the
law
to
rid
himself
of
them
if
they
remained
the
pony
rider
boys
and
their
outfit
had
arrived
that
afternoon
and
during
the
remaining
hours
of
daylight
they
had
been
excitedly
exploring
the
ancient
dwellings
most
of
which
were
in
a
dilapidated
condition
there
was
one
however
two
stories
in
height
that
was
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
in
fact
it
appeared
as
if
it
had
only
recently
been
vacated
after
an
examination
of
all
the
ruins
marquand
had
discovered
what
led
him
to
believe
that
this
was
the
structure
which
the
old
pueblo
chief
referred
to
in
his
description
of
the
resting
place
of
the
treasure
the
chief
had
said
he
had
never
been
near
the
spot
he
was
the
only
member
of
his
tribe
to
whom
the
secret
had
been
handed
down
and
he
in
turn
had
transmitted
it
to
the
white
man
who
now
stood
within
the
shadow
of
the
ancient
dwelling
place
i
have
my
reasons
for
believing
this
is
the
place
answered
marquand
in
response
to
the
professor
question
if
i
am
wrong
we
shall
have
to
wait
until
the
moon
rises
night
come
inside
now
and
we
will
close
the
door
all
hands
crowded
into
the
cool
chamber
closing
the
heavy
wooden
door
that
barred
the
entrance

muttered
stacy
ought
to
leave
the
door
open
no
one
answered
him
in
the
darkened
chamber
with
its
peculiar
musty
odors
the
boys
did
not
feel
in
the
mood
for
hilarity
or
even
for
speech
there
was
something
about
their
situation
that
seemed
to
impress
them
profoundly

over
against
the
wall
on
the
side
so
as
not
to
obstruct
any
light
that
might
possibly
get
in
here
directed
marquand
the
others
moved
silently
to
the
side
of
the
room
indicated
by
him
they
had
stood
thus
for
fully
five
minutes
when
an
exclamation
from
stacy
broke
the
stillness
harshly
look
look
cried
the
fat
boy
a
slender
shaft
of
light
had
suddenly
pierced
the
blackness
coming
they
knew
not
whence
it
was
there
must
be
a
pin
hole
through
the
wall
up
near
the
ceiling
suggested
kris
kringle
the
silver
thread
shot
across
the
chamber
ending
abruptly
on
the
adobe
floor
some
three
feet
from
the
back
wall
that
the
spot
shouted
marquand
triumphantly
he
threw
himself
on
the
floor
and
with
his
knife
scratched
a
cross
on
the
spot
where
the
moonbeam
rested
scarcely
had
he
done
so
when
the
delicate
shaft
of
light
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
it
gone
breathed
the
boys
but
it
has
pointed
the
way
and
we
have
followed
the
silver
trail
to
its
end
added
ned
rector
poetically
bring
the
tools
cried
marquand
while
they
were
doing
so
he
struck
a
match
and
lighted
the
lantern
that
they
had
brought
with
them
from
their
camp
in
the
foothills
his
first
care
was
to
bar
the
door
with
the
heavy
wooden
timber
that
he
had
cut
and
which
he
now
slipped
into
its
fastenings
a
close
examination
of
the
floor
revealed
no
marks
save
those
put
there
by
the
knife
this
house
seems
to
be
built
on
the
solid
ground
i
do
not
think
you
will
find
anything
under
it
protested
the
professor
there
are
houses
under
every
one
of
these
buildings
answered
marquand
he
held
a
short
keen
edged
bar
in
place
while
kris
kringle
swung
the
maul
gradually
they
cut
a
ring
about
two
feet
in
diameter
about
the
cross
the
material
of
which
the
floor
had
been
made
had
been
tempered
with
the
years
and
was
almost
as
hard
as
flint
the
steady
thud
of
the
heavy
maul
accompanied
by
the
click
click
of
the
cutting
bar
the
dim
light
the
silent
expectant
faces
formed
a
weird
picture
in
this
silent
desert
place
after
a
full
half
hour
of
this
the
two
men
paused
and
stood
back
drawing
sleeves
across
their
foreheads
to
wipe
away
the
perspiration
stacy
brown
walked
pompously
over
to
the
circle
maybe
i
can
fall
through
it
if
i
ca
nobody
can
he
said
jumping
up
and
down
on
the
spot
where
they
had
been
cutting
there
followed
a
rambling
sound
and
with
a
yell
stacy
brown
suddenly
disappeared
from
sight
in
place
of
the
circle
in
which
he
had
been
standing
was
a
black
ragged
hole
from
which
particles
of
the
mortar
were
still
crumbling
and
rattling
to
the
bottom
of
the
pit
are
you
there
cried
kris
kringle
leaping
to
the
spot
thrusting
the
lantern
down
through
the
opening
master
stacy
wow
responded
the
boy
from
the
depths
did
it
hurt
you
how
far
did
you
fall
this
and
other
questions
were
hurled
at
the
fat
boy
as
his
companions
crowded
about
the
opening
i
killed
that
answer
all
your
questions
replied
stacy
hurry
up
get
my
remains
out
of
this
place
the
rays
of
the
lantern
disclosed
a
short
stairway
built
of
the
same
material
of
which
the
house
itself
had
been
constructed
marquand
forced
himself
past
the
guide
and
was
down
the
steps
in
a
twinkling
he
was
followed
by
the
wondering
pony
rider
boys
professor
zepplin
and
kris
kringle
in
short
order
for
all
crowded
down
through
the
narrow
opening
chunky
had
hit
the
top
step
and
rolled
all
the
way
down
he
had
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
was
rubbing
his
shins
by
the
time
his
friends
reached
him
his
clothes
were
torn
and
he
was
covered
with
dust
fell
down
the
cellar
did
i
he
grinned
but
no
one
gave
any
heed
to
him
now
marquand
had
snatched
at
the
lantern
and
was
running
from
point
to
point
of
the
chamber
in
which
they
found
themselves
he
was
laboring
under
great
excitement
here
another
opening
he
shouted
we
have
got
to
the
bottom
yet
another
flight
of
stairs
led
to
still
another
and
smaller
chamber
below
marquand
let
out
a
yell
the
moment
he
reached
the
bottom
the
others
rushed
after
him
there
with
it
top
just
showing
above
the
dirt
was
a
long
iron
chest
give
me
the
maul
shouted
the
excited
treasure
seeker
he
attacked
the
rusty
iron
fastenings
at
last
the
cover
yielded
to
his
thunderous
blows
and
falling
on
its
edge
toppled
over
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
somebody
old
clothes
chuckled
stacy
peering
into
the
open
chest
the
garments
priestly
robes
that
lay
at
the
top
fell
to
pieces
the
instant
marquand
laid
violent
hands
on
them
look
look
was
i
right
or
was
i
wrong
he
cried
beside
himself
with
joy
there
before
their
astonished
eyes
lay
a
chest
of
gold
coins
dulled
by
age
small
nuggets
and
chunks
of
silver
all
heaped
indiscriminately
in
the
treasure
chest
i
did
it
shouted
chunky
i
did
it
with
my
little
feet
i
fell
in
and
discovered
the
treasure
the
tongues
of
the
pony
rider
boys
were
suddenly
loosened
such
a
shout
as
they
set
up
probably
never
had
been
heard
before
in
the
ancient
adobe
mansion
of
the
pueblos
cheer
after
cheer
echoed
through
the
chambers
and
reached
the
ears
of
a
dozen
desperadoes
who
were
skulking
amid
the
sage
brush
without
professor
zepplin
scooped
up
a
handful
of
the
coins
and
examined
them
under
the
lantern
old
spanish
coins
he
informed
them
pure
gold
and
look
at
these
nuggets
where
do
you
suppose
the
indians
found
them
there
are
hidden
mines
in
the
state
informed
marquand
some
of
these
days
they
will
be
discovered
i
have
been
hunting
for
them
myself
but
without
success
boys
what
do
you
think
of
it
now
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
i
might
never
have
seen
this
sight
their
eyes
were
fairly
bulging
as
they
gazed
at
the
heap
of
gold
chunky
squatted
down
scooping
up
a
double
handful
and
letting
the
coins
run
through
his
fingers
then
the
other
boys
dipped
in
laughing
for
pure
joy
more
because
their
adventure
had
borne
fruit
than
for
the
love
of
the
gold
itself
must
be
more
a
bushel
of
it
announced
stacy
those
old
franciscans
must
have
been
saving
up
for
a
rainy
day
and
it
never
rained
here
at
all
suggested
ned
humorously
shall
we
count
it
asked
marquand
just
as
you
wish
replied
the
professor
were
i
in
your
place
marquand
i
should
get
the
stuff
out
of
here
as
soon
as
possible
you
ca
tell
what
may
happen
i
would
suggest
that
we
secure
the
treasure
and
be
on
our
way
at
once
you
will
want
to
get
it
to
a
bank
as
quickly
as
possible
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
can
not
be
kept
quiet
you
are
right
will
somebody
go
over
to
the
camp
and
get
those
gunny
sacks
of
mine
i
do
want
to
lose
sight
of
my
find
for
a
minute
you
know
how
i
feel
about
it
not
that
i
do
not
trust
you
you
know
surely
we
understand
smiled
tad
and
you
all
have
an
interest
in
it
you
shall
share
the
treasure
with
me
no
we
do
shouted
the
boys
we
had
more
than
a
million
dollars
worth
of
fun
out
of
it
already
certainly
not
added
the
professor
we
discuss
that
later
said
marquand
firmly
just
now
we
must
take
care
of
what
we
have
found
who
will
get
the
bags
we
will
answered
the
boys
promptly
no
you
stay
here
i
get
them
answered
kris
kringle
light
me
up
the
stairs
so
i
do
break
my
neck
in
this
old
rookery
one
of
the
boys
lighted
the
way
to
the
next
floor
then
stepped
back
into
the
cellar
where
marquand
was
turning
over
the
treasure
in
an
effort
to
find
out
if
the
pile
extended
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
chest
in
the
meantime
kris
kringle
unbarred
the
door
and
threw
it
part
way
open
he
did
it
cautiously
as
if
half
expecting
trouble
he
threw
the
door
to
with
a
bang
springing
to
one
side
and
dropping
the
bar
back
into
place
the
reason
for
his
sudden
change
of
plans
was
that
no
sooner
had
the
door
opened
than
several
calibre
bullets
were
fired
from
the
sage
brush
outside
kris
kringle
waited
to
learn
whether
those
in
the
cellar
had
heard
the
shots
but
they
had
not
they
were
some
distance
below
ground
and
their
minds
were
wholly
taken
up
with
the
great
treasure
before
them
after
a
few
moments
the
guide
once
more
removed
the
bar
first
having
drawn
his
revolver
in
case
of
sudden
surprise
then
he
cautiously
opened
the
door
an
inch
or
so
at
first
nothing
happened
the
moonlit
landscape
lay
as
silent
and
peaceful
as
if
there
were
not
a
human
being
on
the
desert
there
were
six
distinct
flashes
all
at
once
and
a
rain
of
lead
showered
into
the
door
kris
kringle
took
a
pot
shot
at
one
of
the
flashes
then
slammed
the
door
shut
and
barred
it
well
i
hope
that
would
get
you
he
muttered
hastily
retracing
his
steps
he
called
the
party
up
to
the
second
cellar
did
you
fetch
the
sacks
called
marquand
no
but
i
fetched
trouble
it
coming
in
sackfuls
what
do
you
mean
we
besieged
besieged
wondered
the
professor
yes
there
a
crowd
outside
and
they
been
trying
to
shoot
me
up
must
be
some
of
your
friends
mr
marquand
lasar
and
comstock
the
scoundrels
growled
marquand
but
make
short
work
of
them
not
so
easy
as
you
think
there
are
more
than
two
out
there
a
crowd
and
they
got
rifles
our
rifles
are
over
in
the
camp
got
a
and
so
have
you
but
what
do
they
amount
to
against
half
a
dozen
rifles
i
talk
to
them
if
i
can
get
any
place
to
make
them
hear
announced
marquand
starting
up
the
stairs
i
reckon
there
a
window
on
the
second
floor
but
you
better
be
careful
that
you
do
get
winged
warned
the
guide
marquand
went
right
on
and
the
others
followed
as
the
guide
had
said
there
was
a
small
window
on
the
floor
above
the
ground
apparently
the
only
one
in
the
house
marquand
hailed
the
besiegers
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
mean
by
shooting
us
up
in
this
fashion
he
demanded
you
ought
to
know
who
we
are
jim
marquand
and
you
know
what
we
want
yes
i
know
you
all
right
lasar
and
i
make
you
smart
for
this
the
place
is
as
much
mine
as
it
is
yours
answered
lasar
and
i
propose
to
take
it
if
you
make
an
even
divvy
of
what
you
have
found
or
expect
to
find
we
go
away
and
let
you
alone
if
you
do
we
take
the
whole
outfit
take
it
take
it
jeered
marquand
you
could
take
it
in
a
hundred
years
not
unless
you
used
artillery
then
we
starve
you
out
replied
the
man
in
the
sage
brush
look
out
warned
the
guide
marquand
sprang
to
one
side
just
as
a
volley
crashed
through
the
opening
the
bullets
rattling
to
the
floor
after
bounding
back
from
the
walls
i
guess
they
got
you
marquand
we
ca
hold
out
forever
if
we
had
rifles
we
could
pick
them
off
by
daylight
but
when
morning
comes
they
draw
back
out
of
revolver
range
and
plunk
the
first
man
who
shows
himself
outside
have
you
any
title
to
this
property
yes
i
have
bought
up
a
hundred
acres
about
here
the
deeds
are
in
my
pocket
i
guess
nobody
has
a
better
his
title
is
all
right
spoke
up
professor
zepplin
i
made
sure
of
that
before
i
decided
to
come
with
mr
marquand
then
there
only
one
thing
to
be
done
what
that
get
a
sheriff
posse
and
bag
the
whole
bunch
marquand
laughed
harshly
if
we
were
in
a
position
to
get
a
posse
we
should
be
able
to
get
away
without
one
i
think
we
had
better
go
below
this
is
not
a
very
safe
place
with
this
open
window
i
remain
here
what
for
kringle
somebody
got
to
watch
the
front
door
to
see
that
they
do
play
any
tricks
on
us
it
clouding
up
and
if
the
night
gets
dark
try
to
get
in
how
far
is
it
to
a
place
where
we
could
get
a
sheriff
asked
tad
who
had
been
thinking
deeply
hondo
fifteen
miles
due
east
of
here
as
the
moon
rises
why
if
i
were
sure
i
could
find
my
way
i
think
i
might
get
some
help
answered
the
lad
quietly
you
snapped
marquand
turning
on
him
if
i
had
a
rope
perhaps
i
can
do
it
without
one
i
like
to
know
how
marquand
was
inclined
to
treat
the
proposition
lightly
believing
that
such
a
move
as
proposed
by
tad
butler
was
an
impossibility
kris
kringle
however
was
regarding
the
boy
inquiringly
he
knew
that
tad
had
some
plan
in
mind
and
that
it
was
likely
to
be
a
good
one
the
rascals
are
all
out
in
front
of
the
house
are
they
yes
master
tad
there
no
reason
why
they
should
be
behind
the
house
they
know
we
ca
get
out
that
way
because
there
is
no
opening
on
that
side
tad
nodded
then
i
can
do
it
tad
what
foolish
idea
have
you
in
mind
now
i
can
not
consent
to
your
taking
any
more
chances
professor
we
are
taking
long
enough
chances
as
it
is
unless
we
are
relieved
soon
we
shall
be
starved
out
and
perhaps
worse
what
your
plan
interrupted
kris
kringle
see
that
hole
in
the
roof
up
there
tad
pointed
they
had
not
seen
it
before
but
they
did
now
a
light
suddenly
dawned
upon
kris
kringle
boy
you
are
the
only
one
in
the
outfit
you
would
have
made
a
corking
indian
fighter
i
the
indian
fighter
chimed
in
stacy
you
can
boost
me
up
to
the
hole
and
i
go
over
the
rear
of
the
house
get
to
the
camp
and
from
there
ride
to
hondo
tad
three
companions
started
a
cheer
which
the
guide
sternly
put
down
i
ca
consent
to
any
such
plan
decided
the
professor
sternly
the
rest
reasoned
with
him
until
finally
he
did
consent
though
he
knew
the
lad
would
be
taking
desperate
chances
tad
understood
that
as
well
as
the
rest
of
them
but
he
was
burning
to
be
off
kris
kringle
gave
him
careful
directions
as
to
how
to
get
to
the
place
take
your
rifle
with
you
if
you
can
get
it
after
you
get
half
a
mile
or
a
mile
away
shoot
once
that
will
tell
us
you
are
all
right
you
can
help
me
in
getting
away
from
here
if
you
will
do
some
shooting
to
cover
my
escape
suggested
tad
that
a
good
idea
agreed
the
guide
you
wait
on
the
roof
until
we
begin
to
rake
the
sage
with
our
revolvers
then
drop
take
a
wide
circuit
so
that
you
wo
stumble
over
the
enemy
tad
gave
his
belt
a
hitch
stuffed
his
sombrero
under
it
and
announced
himself
as
ready
the
guide
stepped
under
the
hole
tad
quickly
climbed
to
his
shoulder
and
stood
up
like
a
circus
performer
he
could
easily
reach
the
roof
with
his
hands
a
second
more
and
his
feet
were
lifted
from
the
shoulders
of
the
guide
they
saw
the
figure
in
the
opening
then
it
disappeared
a
slight
scraping
noise
was
the
only
sound
they
heard
tad
flattened
himself
out
and
wriggled
along
toward
the
rear
of
the
roof
peering
over
the
edge
he
made
sure
that
there
was
no
one
about
he
then
lay
quietly
waiting
for
the
shooting
to
begin
let
have
it
directed
kris
kringle
a
sudden
fusillade
was
emptied
into
the
sage
brush
tad
swung
himself
over
the
edge
of
the
roof
hung
on
for
a
few
seconds
then
dropped
lightly
to
the
ground
chapter
xxiv
conclusion
the
enemy
answered
the
shots
with
a
volley
and
for
a
few
moments
a
lot
of
ammunition
was
wasted
while
the
odor
of
gunpowder
assailed
nostrils
on
both
sides
after
that
the
shooting
died
away
as
the
minutes
lengthened
into
an
hour
and
no
word
of
tad
mission
had
been
received
the
defenders
began
to
grow
restless
they
were
under
a
double
tension
now
marquand
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
floor
suddenly
forgetful
of
the
danger
that
lurked
out
there
he
poked
his
head
out
of
the
window
a
sharp
pat
on
the
stone
window
frame
beside
him
after
the
bullet
had
snipped
off
the
tip
of
his
left
ear
caused
marquand
to
draw
back
suddenly
he
stalked
about
the
floor
holding
a
handkerchief
to
the
wounded
ear
talking
in
dashes
and
asterisks
as
chunky
put
it
kris
kringle
face
wore
a
grim
smile
he
was
taking
chances
of
being
shot
every
second
now
but
he
insisted
in
holding
his
place
at
the
side
of
the
window
so
he
could
listen
and
watch
a
thin
fleecy
veil
covered
the
moon
but
it
was
not
dense
enough
to
fully
hide
objects
on
the
landscape
all
keep
quiet
now
warned
kris
kringle
we
should
get
a
signal
pretty
soon
i
afraid
something
has
happened
to
the
boy
muttered
the
professor
then
all
fell
silent
there
it
goes
exclaimed
the
guide
in
a
tone
of
great
relief
the
crack
of
a
rifle
afar
off
sounded
clear
and
distinct
he
made
it
thank
heaven
breathed
marquand
fervently
chunky
leaped
to
the
opening
swung
his
sombrero
as
he
leaned
out
and
uttered
a
long
shrill
a
bullet
chipped
the
adobe
at
his
side
stacy
ducked
throwing
himself
on
the
floor
sucking
a
thumb
energetically
wing
you
inquired
kris
kringle
somebody
burned
my
thumb
wailed
the
fat
boy
it
was
a
bullet
that
burned
you
served
you
right
too
somebody
tie
that
boy
up
or
he
be
killed
counseled
the
guide
the
besiegers
could
not
have
failed
to
hear
the
shot
from
tad
rifle
but
it
did
not
seem
to
disturb
them
they
evidently
did
not
even
dream
that
one
of
the
party
had
escaped
their
vigilance
and
that
he
was
well
on
his
way
for
assistance
the
wait
from
that
time
on
was
a
tedious
and
trying
one
though
each
felt
a
certain
sense
of
elation
that
tad
butler
had
succeeded
in
outwitting
the
enemy
it
was
shortly
after
two
in
the
morning
when
kris
kringle
espied
a
party
of
horsemen
slowly
encircling
the
adobe
house
the
riders
were
strung
out
far
off
on
the
plain
those
hiding
in
the
sage
in
front
of
the
house
could
not
see
the
approaching
horsemen
there
they
come
whispered
kris
kringle
begin
shooting
the
two
men
started
firing
while
the
besiegers
poured
volley
after
volley
through
the
window
the
posse
at
this
closed
in
at
a
gallop
their
rifles
now
began
to
crash
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
all
over
the
sheriff
men
surrounded
the
besiegers
placing
every
man
of
them
under
arrest
after
this
the
officers
quickly
liberated
the
pony
rider
boys
three
of
the
besiegers
had
been
wounded
among
them
was
the
mexican
whom
tad
had
defeated
in
the
tilting
game
a
few
days
before
when
all
was
over
the
boys
hoisted
tad
butler
on
their
shoulders
and
marched
around
the
adobe
house
shouting
and
singing
marquand
decided
to
go
back
with
the
posse
using
these
men
as
a
guard
for
his
treasure
it
was
understood
that
the
pony
rider
boys
were
to
follow
the
next
morning
before
leaving
marquand
called
the
professor
aside
there
is
on
a
rough
estimate
all
of
sixty
thousand
dollars
in
the
treasure
chest
had
it
not
been
for
you
and
your
brave
boys
i
should
have
lost
it
so
when
you
reach
hondo
i
shall
take
great
pleasure
in
presenting
to
each
of
you
a
draft
for
two
thousand
dollars
professor
zepplin
protested
but
marquand
insisted
and
he
kept
his
word
after
the
posse
with
their
prisoners
and
the
treasure
had
started
the
pony
rider
boys
arm
in
arm
started
off
across
the
moonlit
meadows
toward
their
camp
it
was
their
last
night
in
camp
their
summer
journeyings
had
come
to
an
end
a
fitting
close
to
their
adventurous
travels
not
a
word
did
they
speak
until
they
reached
the
camp
there
they
turned
and
gazed
off
over
the
plain
which
was
all
silvered
under
the
now
clear
light
of
the
moon
it
has
been
a
silver
trail
mused
tad
butler
it
has
indeed
breathed
his
companions
and
we
reached
the
end
of
the
silver
trail
added
the
professor
coming
up
at
that
moment
i
breathe
the
first
free
breath
that
i
drawn
in
three
months
the
boys
circled
slowly
around
him
and
joined
hands
then
their
voices
rose
on
the
mellow
desert
air
to
the
tune
of
home
sweet
home
a
week
later
saw
the
wanderers
back
in
chillicothe
their
welcome
was
a
warm
one
banker
perkins
