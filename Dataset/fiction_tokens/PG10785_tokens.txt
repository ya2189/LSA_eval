dowson
sat
by
the
kitchen
fire
smoking
and
turning
a
docile
and
trained
ear
to
the
heated
words
which
fell
from
his
wife
lips

do
the

dowson
with

said
his
wife
restraining
herself
by
an
effort

hard
at
his
pipe
through
the
cover
of
the
smoke
he
bestowed
a
sympathetic
wink
upon
his
daughter

the
sentimental

such

as

and
look
what
to

miss
dowson
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
subsiding
in
her
chair
went
on
with
her
book
until
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
and
a
cheerful
but
peculiarly
shrill
whistle
sounded
outside

miss
dowson
subsiding
in

on
with
her
book

my
lord
exclaimed
dowson
waspishly

think
the

to
him
and
now
he
dancing
on
my
clean
doorstep
might
be
only
knocking
the
mud
off
afore
coming
in

dowson
as
he
rose
to
open
the
door
i
noticed

very
careful
i
just
came
in
to
tell

as
he
followed
his
host
into
the
kitchen
and
gazed
tenderly
at
miss
dowson

joke

ever
had
in
my
life
i
my
fortune
told
guess
what
it
was
been
laughing
to
myself
ever
since
who
told
it
inquired
dowson
after
a
somewhat
awkward
silence
old
gypsy
woman
in
peter
street
replied
foss
i
gave
a
wrong
name
and
address
just
in
case
she
might
ha
heard
about
me
and
she
did
make
a
mess
of
it
upon
my
word
she
did
wot
did
she
say
inquired
dowson
foss
laughed
said
i
was
a
wrong
he
said
cheerfully
and
would
bring
my
mother
gray
hairs
to
the
grave
with
sorrow
i
to
bad
companions
and
take
to
drink
i
to
steal
money
to
gamble
with
and
after
all
that
i
to
five
years
for
bigamy
i
told
her
i
was
disappointed
i
was
to
be
hung
and
she
said
it
would
be
a
disappointment
to
a
lot
of
other
people
too
laugh
i
thought
i
should
killed
myself
i
do
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
said
dowson
coldly
i
should
tell
anybody
else
charlie
said
her
husband
keep
it
a
secret
my
boy
but
you
you
do
believe
it
stammered
the
crestfallen
foss
dowson
cast
a
stealthy
glance
at
her
daughter
its
wonderful
some
o
those
can
see
into
the
future
she
said
shaking
her
head
ah
said
her
husband
with
a
confirmatory
nod
wonderful
is
no
name
for
it
i
my
fortune
told
once
when
i
was
a
boy
and
she
told
me
i
should
marry
the
prettiest
and
the
nicest
and
the
gal
in
poplar
foss
with
a
triumphant
smile
barely
waited
for
him
to
finish
there
you
he
began
and
stopped
suddenly
illustration
i
just
came
in
to
tell
you
a
joke
what
was
you
about
to
remark
inquired
dowson
icily
i
was
going
to
say
replied
foss
i
was
going
to
say
i
just
got
it
on
the
tip
o
my
tongue
to
say
you
you
you
all
the
luck
mr
dowson
he
edged
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
flora
but
there
was
a
chilliness
in
the
atmosphere
against
which
his
high
spirits
strove
in
vain
dowson
remembered
other
predictions
which
had
come
true
notably
the
case
of
one
man
who
learning
that
he
was
to
come
in
for
a
legacy
gave
up
a
job
and
did
actually
come
in
for
twenty
pounds
and
a
seven
years
afterwards
illustration
he
edged
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
flora
it
all
nonsense
protested
foss
she
only
said
all
that
because
i
made
fun
of
her
you
do
believe
it
do
you
flora
i
do
see
anything
to
laugh
at
returned
miss
dowson
fancy
five
years
for
bigamy
fancy
the
disgrace
of
it
but
you
talking
as
if
i
was
going
to
do
it
objected
foss
i
wish
you
go
and
your
fortune
told
go
and
see
what
she
says
about
you
you
wo
believe
so
much
in
afterwards
dowson
looked
up
quickly
and
then
lowering
her
eyes
took
her
hand
out
of
the
stocking
she
had
been
darning
and
placing
it
beside
its
companion
rolled
the
pair
into
a
ball
you
go
round
night
flora
she
said
deliberately
it
be
said
a
daughter
of
mine
was
afraid
to
hear
the
truth
about
herself
father
find
the
money
and
she
can
say
what
she
likes
about
you
but
i
believe
it
said
foss
reproachfully
i
do
suppose
it
be
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
said
miss
dowson
sharply
foss
bade
them
suddenly
and
finding
himself
accompanied
to
the
door
by
dowson
gave
way
to
gloom
he
stood
for
so
long
with
one
foot
on
the
step
and
the
other
on
the
mat
that
dowson
who
disliked
draughts
got
impatient
illustration
foss
bade
them
suddenly
you
catch
cold
charlie
he
said
at
last
that
what
i
trying
to
do
said
foss
my
death
o
cold
then
i
get
five
years
for
bigamy
he
added
bitterly
cheer
up
said
dowson
five
years
ai
much
out
of
a
lifetime
and
you
ca
expect
to
your
fun
without
he
watched
the
retreating
figure
of
foss
as
it
stamped
its
way
down
the
street
and
closing
the
door
returned
to
the
kitchen
to
discuss
palmistry
and
other
sciences
until
bedtime
dowson
saw
husband
and
daughter
off
to
work
in
the
morning
and
after
washing
up
the
breakfast
things
drew
her
chair
up
to
the
kitchen
fire
and
became
absorbed
in
memories
of
the
past
all
the
leading
incidents
in
flora
career
passed
in
review
before
her
measles
and
other
things
peculiar
to
the
age
of
innocence
were
all
there
in
her
enthusiasm
she
nearly
gave
her
a
sprained
ankle
which
had
belonged
to
her
sister
still
shaking
her
head
over
her
mistake
she
drew
flora
latest
portrait
carefully
from
its
place
in
the
album
and
putting
on
her
hat
and
jacket
went
round
to
make
a
call
in
peter
street
by
the
time
flora
returned
home
dowson
appeared
to
have
forgotten
the
arrangement
made
the
night
before
and
being
reminded
by
her
daughter
questioned
whether
any
good
could
come
of
attempts
to
peer
into
the
future
dowson
was
still
more
emphatic
but
his
objections
being
recognized
by
both
ladies
as
ones
carried
no
weight
it
ended
in
flora
going
off
with
half
a
crown
in
her
glove
and
an
urgent
request
from
her
father
to
make
it
as
difficult
as
possible
for
the
sibyl
by
giving
a
false
name
and
address
no
name
was
asked
for
however
as
miss
dowson
was
shown
into
the
untidy
little
back
room
on
the
first
floor
in
which
the
sorceress
ate
slept
and
received
visitors
she
rose
from
an
old
as
the
visitor
entered
and
regarding
her
with
a
pair
of
beady
black
eyes
bade
her
sit
down
are
you
the
inquired
the
girl
men
call
me
so
was
the
reply
yes
but
are
you
persisted
miss
dowson
who
inherited
her
fondness
for
half
crowns
yes
said
the
other
in
a
more
natural
voice
she
took
the
girl
left
hand
and
pouring
a
little
dark
liquid
into
the
palm
gazed
at
it
intently
left
for
the
past
right
for
the
future
she
said
in
a
deep
voice
she
muttered
some
strange
words
and
bent
her
head
lower
over
the
hand
illustration
she
muttered
some
strange
words
and
bent
her
head
lower
over
the
girl
hand
i
see
a
infant
she
said
slowly
i
see
a
little
girl
of
four
racked
with
the
i
see
her
later
eight
she
appears
to
be
she
is
in
bed
with
measles
miss
dowson
stared
at
her
she
goes
away
to
the
seaside
to
get
strong
continued
the
sorceress
she
is
paddling
she
falls
into
the
water
and
spoils
her
frock
her
mother
never
mind
about
that
interrupted
the
staring
miss
dowson
hastily
i
was
only
eight
at
the
time
and
mother
always
was
ready
with
her
hands
people
on
the
beach
smile
resumed
the
other
they
it
do
take
much
to
make
some
people
laugh
said
miss
dowson
with
bitterness
at
fourteen
she
and
a
boy
next
door
but
seven
both
have
the
mumps
and
why
not
demanded
miss
dowson
with
great
warmth
why
not
i
only
reading
what
i
see
in
your
hand
said
the
other
at
fifteen
i
see
her
knocked
down
by
a
a
boy
from
opposite
brings
her
home
passing
at
the
time
murmured
miss
dowson
his
head
is
done
up
with
i
see
her
apprenticed
to
a
dressmaker
i
see
her
the
voice
went
on
monotonously
and
flora
gasping
with
astonishment
listened
to
a
long
recital
of
the
remaining
interesting
points
in
her
career
that
brings
us
to
the
present
said
the
soothsayer
dropping
her
hand
now
for
the
future
she
took
the
girl
other
hand
and
poured
some
of
the
liquid
into
it
miss
dowson
shrank
back
if
it
anything
dreadful
she
said
quickly
i
do
want
to
hear
it
it
it
ai
natural
i
can
warn
you
of
dangers
to
keep
clear
of
said
the
other
detaining
her
hand
i
can
let
you
peep
into
the
future
and
see
what
to
do
and
what
to
avoid
ah
she
bent
over
the
girl
hand
again
and
uttered
little
ejaculations
of
surprise
and
perplexity
i
see
you
moving
in
gay
scenes
surrounded
by
happy
faces
she
said
slowly
you
are
much
sought
after
handsome
presents
and
fine
clothes
are
showered
upon
you
you
will
cross
the
sea
i
see
a
dark
young
man
and
a
fair
young
man
they
will
both
influence
your
life
the
fair
young
man
works
in
his
father
shop
he
will
have
great
riches
what
about
the
other
inquired
miss
dowson
after
a
somewhat
lengthy
pause
the
shook
her
head
he
is
his
own
worst
enemy
she
said
and
he
will
drag
down
those
he
loves
with
him
you
are
going
to
marry
one
of
them
but
i
ca
see
clear
i
ca
see
which
look
again
said
the
trembling
flora
i
ca
see
was
the
reply
therefore
it
is
meant
for
me
to
see
it
for
you
to
choose
i
can
see
them
now
as
plain
as
i
can
see
you
you
are
all
three
standing
where
two
roads
meet
the
fair
young
man
is
beckoning
to
you
and
pointing
to
a
big
house
and
a
and
a
yacht
and
the
other
said
the
surprised
miss
dowson
he
in
knickerbockers
said
the
other
doubtfully
what
does
that
mean
ah
i
see
they
got
the
broad
arrow
on
them
and
he
is
pointing
to
a
jail
it
all
gone
i
can
see
no
more
she
dropped
the
girl
hand
and
drawing
her
hand
across
her
eyes
sank
back
into
her
chair
miss
dowson
with
trembling
fingers
dropped
the
half
crown
into
her
lap
and
with
her
head
in
a
whirl
made
her
way
downstairs
after
such
marvels
the
streets
seemed
oddly
commonplace
as
she
walked
swiftly
home
she
decided
as
she
went
to
keep
her
knowledge
to
herself
but
inclination
on
the
one
hand
and
dowson
on
the
other
got
the
better
of
her
resolution
with
the
exception
of
a
few
things
in
her
past
already
known
and
therefore
not
worth
dwelling
upon
the
whole
of
the
interview
was
disclosed
it
fair
takes
your
breath
away
declared
the
astounded
dowson
the
fair
young
man
is
meant
for
ben
lippet
said
his
wife
and
the
dark
one
is
charlie
foss
it
must
be
it
no
use
shutting
your
eyes
to
things
it
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
agreed
her
husband
and
she
told
charlie
five
years
for
bigamy
and
when
she
telling
flora
fortune
she
sees
in
convict
clothes
how
she
does
it
i
ca
think
it
a
gift
said
dowson
briefly
and
i
do
hope
that
flora
is
going
to
act
sensible
anyhow
she
can
let
ben
lippet
come
and
see
her
without
going
upstairs
with
the
he
can
come
if
he
likes
said
flora
though
why
charlie
could
have
the
and
the
five
years
i
do
know
lippet
came
in
the
next
evening
and
the
evening
after
in
fact
so
easy
is
it
to
fall
into
habits
of
an
agreeable
nature
that
nearly
every
evening
saw
him
the
happy
guest
of
dowson
a
spirit
of
resignation
fostered
by
a
present
or
two
and
a
visit
to
the
theatre
descended
upon
miss
dowson
fate
and
her
mother
combined
were
in
a
fair
way
to
overcome
her
inclinations
when
foss
who
had
been
out
of
town
on
a
job
came
in
to
hear
the
result
of
her
visit
to
the
and
found
lippet
installed
in
the
seat
that
used
to
be
his
at
first
dowson
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
his
request
for
information
and
it
was
only
when
his
jocularity
on
the
subject
passed
the
bounds
of
endurance
that
she
consented
to
gratify
his
curiosity
i
did
want
to
tell
you
she
said
when
she
had
finished
but
you
asked
for
it
and
now
you
got
it
it
very
amusing
said
foss
i
wonder
who
the
dark
young
man
in
the
fancy
knickers
is
ah
i
daresay
you
know
some
day
said
dowson
was
the
fair
young
man
a
chap
inquired
the
inquisitive
foss
dowson
hesitated
yes
she
said
defiantly
wonder
who
it
can
be
muttered
foss
in
perplexity
you
know
that
too
some
day
no
doubt
was
the
reply
i
glad
it
to
be
a
chap
he
said
not
that
i
think
flora
believes
in
such
rubbish
as
she
too
sensible
i
do
said
flora
how
should
she
know
all
the
things
i
did
when
i
was
a
little
girl
tell
me
that
i
believe
in
it
too
said
dowson
you
tell
me
not
sensible
foss
quailed
at
the
challenge
and
relapsed
into
moody
silence
the
talk
turned
on
an
aunt
of
lippet
rumored
to
possess
money
and
an
uncle
who
was
rolling
in
it
he
began
to
feel
in
the
way
and
only
his
native
obstinacy
prevented
him
from
going
it
was
a
relief
to
him
when
the
front
door
opened
and
the
heavy
step
of
dowson
was
heard
in
the
tiny
passage
if
anything
it
seemed
heavier
than
usual
and
dowson
manner
when
he
entered
the
room
and
greeted
his
guests
was
singularly
lacking
in
its
usual
cheerfulness
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
and
putting
his
feet
on
the
fender
gazed
moodily
between
the
bars
i
been
wondering
as
i
came
along
he
said
at
last
with
an
obvious
attempt
to
speak
carelessly
whether
this
as
been
hearing
so
much
about
lately
always
comes
out
true
it
depends
on
the
said
his
wife
i
mean
said
dowson
slowly
i
mean
that
gypsy
woman
that
charlie
and
flora
went
to
of
course
it
does
snapped
his
wife
i
trust
what
she
says
afore
anything
i
know
five
or
six
that
she
has
told
said
lippet
plucking
up
courage
and
they
all
believe
they
could
help
themselves
they
said
so
still
she
might
make
a
mistake
sometimes
said
dowson
faintly
might
get
mixed
up
so
to
speak
never
said
dowson
firmly
never
echoed
flora
and
lippet
dowson
heaved
a
big
sigh
and
his
eye
wandered
round
the
room
it
lighted
on
foss
she
an
old
humbug
said
that
gentleman
i
a
good
mind
to
put
the
police
on
to
her
dowson
reached
over
and
gripped
his
hand
then
he
sighed
again
of
course
it
suits
charlie
foss
to
say
so
said
dowson
naturally
he
say
so
he
got
reasons
i
believe
every
word
she
says
if
she
told
me
i
was
coming
in
for
a
fortune
i
should
believe
her
and
if
she
told
me
i
was
going
to
have
misfortunes
i
should
believe
her
do
say
that
shouted
dowson
with
startling
energy
do
say
that
that
what
she
did
say
what
cried
his
wife
sharply
what
are
you
talking
about
i
won
eighteenpence
off
of
bob
stevens
said
her
husband
staring
at
the
table
eighteenpence
is
price
for
telling
the
future
only
and
being
curious
and
feeling
i
like
to
know
what
going
to
to
me
i
went
in
and
had
eighteenpennorth
well
you
upset
said
dowson
with
a
quick
glance
at
him
you
get
upstairs
to
bed
i
sooner
stay
said
her
husband
resuming
his
seat
it
seems
more
cheerful
and
lifelike
i
wish
i
gorn
that
what
i
wish
what
did
she
tell
you
inquired
foss
dowson
thrust
his
hands
into
his
trouser
pockets
and
spoke
desperately
she
says
i
to
live
to
ninety
and
i
to
travel
to
foreign
parts
you
get
to
bed
said
his
wife
come
along
dowson
shook
his
head
doggedly
i
to
be
rich
he
continued
slowly
rich
and
loved
after
my
pore
dear
wife
death
i
to
marry
again
a
young
woman
with
money
and
stormy
brown
eyes
dowson
sprang
from
her
chair
and
stood
over
him
quivering
with
passion
how
dare
you
she
gasped
you
you
been
drinking
i
two
said
her
husband
solemnly
i
should
the
second
only
i
felt
so
miserable
i
know
i
be
with
a
young
woman
dowson
past
speech
sank
back
in
her
chair
and
stared
at
him
i
should
worry
about
it
if
i
was
you
dowson
said
foss
kindly
look
what
she
said
about
me
that
ought
to
show
you
she
to
be
relied
on
eyes
like
lamps
said
dowson
musingly
and
i
next
month
well
they
do
say
every
eye
its
own
idea
of
beauty
a
strange
sound
half
laugh
and
half
cry
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
dowson
she
controlled
herself
by
an
effort
if
she
said
it
she
said
doggedly
with
a
fierce
glance
at
foss
it
come
true
if
after
my
death
my
is
going
to
marry
a
young
woman
with
with
stormy
brown
eyes
interjected
foss
softly
it
his
fate
and
it
ca
be
avoided
concluded
dowson
but
it
so
soon
said
the
unfortunate
husband
you
to
die
in
three
weeks
and
i
to
be
married
three
months
after
dowson
moistened
her
lips
and
tried
but
in
vain
to
avoid
the
glittering
eye
of
foss
three
she
said
mechanically
three
three
weeks
do
be
frightened
said
foss
in
a
winning
voice
i
believe
it
and
besides
we
shall
soon
see
and
if
you
do
die
in
three
weeks
perhaps
i
get
five
years
for
bigamy
and
perhaps
flora
wo
marry
a
fair
man
with
millions
of
money
and
no
perhaps
she
is
wrong
after
all
mother
said
dowson
hopefully
dowson
gave
him
a
singularly
unkind
look
for
one
about
to
leave
him
so
soon
and
afraid
to
trust
herself
to
speech
left
the
room
and
went
as
the
door
closed
behind
her
foss
took
the
chair
which
lippet
had
thoughtlessly
vacated
and
offered
such
consolations
to
flora
as
he
considered
suitable
to
the
occasion
