i
the
ancient
port
of
sunwich
was
basking
in
the
sunshine
of
a
july
afternoon
a
rattle
of
cranes
and
winches
sounded
from
the
shipping
in
the
harbour
but
the
town
itself
was
half
asleep
somnolent
shopkeepers
in
dim
back
parlours
coyly
veiled
their
faces
in
red
handkerchiefs
from
the
too
ardent
flies
while
small
boys
left
in
charge
noticed
listlessly
the
slow
passing
of
time
as
recorded
by
the
church
clock
it
is
a
fine
church
and
sunwich
is
proud
of
it
the
tall
grey
tower
is
a
landmark
at
sea
but
from
the
narrow
streets
of
the
little
town
itself
it
has
a
disquieting
appearance
of
rising
suddenly
above
the
roofs
huddled
beneath
it
for
the
purpose
of
displaying
a
clock
with
gilt
numerals
whose
mellow
chimes
have
recorded
the
passing
hours
for
many
generations
of
sunwich
men
regardless
of
the
heat
which
indeed
was
mild
compared
with
that
which
raged
in
his
own
bosom
captain
nugent
fresh
from
the
inquiry
of
the
collision
of
his
ship
with
the
german
barque
strode
rapidly
up
the
high
street
in
the
direction
of
home
an
honest
seafaring
smell
compounded
of
tar
rope
and
fish
known
to
the
educated
of
sunwich
as
ozone
set
his
thoughts
upon
the
sea
he
longed
to
be
aboard
ship
again
with
the
court
of
inquiry
to
form
part
of
his
crew
in
all
his
fifty
years
of
life
he
had
never
met
such
a
collection
of
fools
his
hard
blue
eyes
blazed
as
he
thought
of
them
and
the
mouth
hidden
by
his
beard
was
set
with
anger
samson
wilks
his
steward
who
had
been
with
him
to
london
to
give
evidence
had
had
a
time
upon
which
he
looked
back
in
later
years
with
much
satisfaction
at
his
powers
of
endurance
he
was
with
the
captain
and
yet
not
with
him
when
they
got
out
of
the
train
at
sunwich
he
hesitated
as
to
whether
he
should
follow
the
captain
or
leave
him
his
excuse
for
following
was
the
bag
his
reason
for
leaving
the
volcanic
condition
of
its
owner
temper
coupled
with
the
fact
that
he
appeared
to
be
sublimely
ignorant
that
the
most
devoted
steward
in
the
world
was
tagging
faithfully
along
a
yard
or
two
in
the
rear
the
few
glanced
at
the
couple
with
interest
wilks
had
what
is
called
an
expressive
face
and
he
had
worked
his
sandy
eyebrows
his
weak
blue
eyes
and
large
tremulous
mouth
into
such
an
expression
of
surprise
at
the
finding
of
the
court
that
he
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
beholder
of
visions
he
changed
the
bag
to
his
other
hand
as
they
left
the
town
behind
them
and
regarded
with
gratitude
the
approaching
end
of
his
labours
at
the
of
a
house
some
along
the
road
the
captain
stopped
and
after
an
impatient
fumbling
at
the
latch
strode
up
the
path
followed
by
wilks
and
knocked
at
the
door
as
he
paused
on
the
step
he
half
turned
and
for
the
first
time
noticed
the
facial
expression
of
his
faithful
follower
what
the
dickens
are
you
looking
like
that
for
he
demanded
i
been
surprised
sir
conceded
wilks
surprised
and
astonished
wrath
blazed
again
in
the
captain
eyes
and
set
lines
in
his
forehead
he
was
being
pitied
by
a
steward
you
been
drinking
he
said
crisply
put
that
bag
down
arsking
your
pardon
sir
said
the
steward
twisting
his
unusually
dry
lips
into
a
smile
but
i
no
opportunity
sir
i
been
you
all
day
sir
a
servant
opened
the
door
you
been
soaking
in
it
for
a
month
declared
the
captain
as
he
entered
the
hall
why
the
blazes
do
you
bring
that
bag
in
are
you
so
drunk
you
do
know
what
you
are
doing
wilks
picked
the
bag
up
and
followed
humbly
into
the
house
then
he
lost
his
head
altogether
and
gave
some
colour
to
his
superior
charges
by
first
cannoning
into
the
servant
and
then
wedging
the
captain
firmly
in
the
doorway
of
the
with
the
bag
steward
rasped
the
captain
yessir
said
the
unhappy
wilks
go
and
sit
down
in
the
kitchen
and
do
leave
this
house
till
sober
wilks
disappeared
he
was
not
in
his
first
lustre
but
he
was
an
ardent
admirer
of
the
sex
and
in
an
way
he
passed
his
arm
round
the
handmaiden
waist
and
sustained
a
buffet
which
made
his
head
ring
a
man
o
your
age
and
drunk
too
explained
the
damsel
wilks
denied
both
charges
it
appeared
that
he
was
much
younger
than
he
looked
while
as
for
drink
he
had
forgotten
the
taste
of
it
a
question
as
to
the
reception
ann
would
have
accorded
a
boyish
teetotaler
remained
unanswered
in
the
kingdom
the
captain
widowed
sister
put
down
her
as
her
brother
entered
and
turned
to
him
expectantly
there
was
an
expression
of
loving
sympathy
on
her
mild
and
rather
foolish
face
and
the
captain
stiffened
at
once
i
was
in
the
wrong
he
said
harshly
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
my
certificate
has
been
suspended
for
six
months
and
my
first
officer
has
been
commended
suspended
gasped
kingdom
pushing
back
the
white
streamer
to
the
cap
which
she
wore
in
memory
of
the
late
kingdom
and
sitting
upright
you
i
think
that
what
i
said
replied
her
brother
kingdom
gazed
at
him
mournfully
and
putting
her
hand
behind
her
began
a
wriggling
search
in
her
pocket
for
a
handkerchief
with
the
idea
of
paying
a
wholesome
tribute
of
tears
she
was
a
in
the
art
of
grief
and
pending
its
extraction
a
docile
tear
hung
on
her
eyelid
and
waited
the
captain
eyed
her
preparations
with
silent
anger
i
am
not
surprised
said
kingdom
dabbing
her
eyes
i
expected
it
somehow
i
seemed
to
have
a
warning
of
it
something
seemed
to
tell
me
i
could
explain
but
i
seemed
to
know
she
sniffed
gently
and
wiping
one
eye
at
a
time
kept
the
disengaged
one
charged
with
sisterly
solicitude
upon
her
brother
the
captain
with
steadily
rising
anger
endured
this
game
of
for
five
minutes
then
he
rose
and
muttering
strange
things
in
his
beard
stalked
upstairs
to
his
room
kingdom
thus
forsaken
dried
her
eyes
and
resumed
her
work
the
remainder
of
the
family
were
in
the
kitchen
ministering
to
the
wants
of
a
misunderstood
steward
and
in
return
extracting
information
which
should
render
them
independent
of
the
captain
version
was
it
very
solemn
sam
inquired
miss
nugent
aged
nine
who
was
sitting
on
the
kitchen
table
wilks
used
his
hands
and
eyebrows
to
indicate
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
they
even
made
the
leave
off
speaking
he
said
in
an
awed
voice
i
should
have
liked
to
have
been
there
said
master
nugent
dutifully
ann
said
miss
nugent
go
and
draw

a
jug
of
beer
beer
miss
said
ann
a
jug
of
beer
repeated
miss
nugent
peremptorily
ann
took
a
jug
from
the
dresser
and
wilks
who
was
watching
her
coughed
helplessly
his
perturbation
attracted
the
attention
of
his
hostess
and
looking
round
for
the
cause
she
was
just
in
time
to
see
ann
disappearing
into
the
larder
with
a
cream
jug
illustration
his
perturbation
attracted
the
attention
of
his
hostess
the
big
jug
ann
she
said
impatiently
you
ought
to
know
sam
would
like
a
big
one
ann
changed
the
jugs
and
ignoring
a
mild
triumph
in
wilks
eye
returned
to
the
larder
whence
ensued
a
musical
trickling
then
miss
nugent
raising
the
jug
with
some
difficulty
poured
out
a
tumbler
for
the
steward
with
her
own
fair
hands
sam
likes
beer
she
said
speaking
generally
i
knew
that
the
first
time
i
see
him
miss
the
vindictive
ann
wilks
drained
his
glass
and
set
it
down
on
the
table
again
making
a
feeble
gesture
of
repulse
as
miss
nugent
refilled
it
go
on
sam
she
said
with
kindly
encouragement
how
much
does
this
jug
hold
jack
quart
replied
her
brother
how
many
quarts
are
there
in
a
gallon
four
miss
nugent
looked
troubled
i
heard
father
say
he
drinks
gallons
a
day
she
remarked
you
better
fill
all
the
jugs
ann
it
was
only
way
o
speaking
said
wilks
hurriedly
the
is
like
that
sometimes
i
knew
a
man
once
miss
said
ann
as
used
to
prefer
to
it
in
a
basin
odd
man
was
like
wilks
in
the
face
only
wilks
sat
upright
and
in
the
mental
struggle
involved
in
taking
in
this
insult
in
all
its
ramifications
did
not
notice
until
too
late
that
miss
nugent
had
filled
his
glass
again
it
must
ha
been
nice
for
the
captain
to
you
with
remarked
ann
carelessly
it
was
said
wilks
pausing
with
the
glass
at
his
lips
and
eyeing
her
sternly
eighteen
years
i
bin
with
ever
since
a
ship
took
a
fancy
to
me
the
fust
time

on
me

inquired
miss
nugent
shuffling
closer
to
him
on
the
table
and
regarding
him
affectionately
much
as
i
am
now
miss
replied
wilks
setting
down
his
glass
and
regarding
ann
giggles
with
a
cold
eye
miss
nugent
sighed
i
love
you
sam
she
said
simply
will
you
have
some
more
beer
wilks
declined
gracefully
eighteen
years

remarked
softly
through
calms
and
storms

foul

by
side
always
ready
in
a
quiet
and
way
to

his
and
lost
ship

wilks
sit
down
and
starve
ashore
till
he
gets
another
at
these
touching
words
miss
nugent
was
undisguisedly
affected
and
wiping
her
bright
eyes
with
her
pinafore
gave
her
small
nose
a
slight
touch
with
the
same
useful
garment
and
squeezed
his
arm
affectionately
it
a
lively
for
me
if
father
is
going
to
be
at
home
for
long
remarked
master
nugent

wonder
if

fust
officer

replied
the
steward
he
was
going
in
the
fog
afore
he
sent
down
to
rouse
your
father
and
as
soon
as
your
father
came
on
deck
went
at
hardy
was
commended
and
your
father
certifikit
was
suspended
for
six
months
master
nugent
whistled
thoughtfully
and
quitting
the
kitchen
proceeded
upstairs
to
his
room
and
first
washing
himself
with
unusual
care
for
a
boy
of
thirteen
put
on
a
clean
collar
and
brushed
his
hair
he
was
not
going
to
provide
a
suspended
with
any
obvious
reasons
for
while
he
was
thus
occupied
the
bell
rang
and
ann
answering
it
left
wilks
in
the
kitchen
listening
with
some
trepidation
to
the
conversation
is
that
steward
of
mine
still
in
the
kitchen
demanded
the
captain
gruffly
yessir
said
ann
what
he
doing
wilks
ears
quivered
anxiously
and
he
eyed
with
unwonted
disfavour
the
evidences
of
his
late
debauch
sitting
down
sir
replied
ann
give
him
a
glass
of
ale
and
send
him
off
commanded
the
captain
and
if
that
was
miss
kate
i
heard
talking
send
her
in
to
me
ann
took
the
message
back
to
the
kitchen
and
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
engaged
upon
an
unpleasant
task
drew
wilks
another
glass
of
ale
and
stood
over
him
with
wonder
while
he
drank
it
miss
nugent
walked
into
the
and
listening
in
a
perfunctory
fashion
to
a
shipmaster
platitude
on
took
a
seat
on
his
knee
and
kissed
his
ear
chapter
ii
the
downfall
of
captain
nugent
was
for
some
time
a
welcome
subject
of
conversation
in
marine
circles
at
sunwich
at
the
goblets
a
rambling
old
inn
with
paved
courtyard
and
wooden
galleries
which
almost
backed
on
to
the
churchyard
attributed
it
to
an
error
of
judgment
at
the
two
schooners
on
the
quay
the
profanest
of
sailormen
readily
attributed
it
to
an
providence
with
a
dislike
of
illustration
a
welcome
subject
of
conversation
in
marine
circles
the
captain
cup
was
filled
to
the
brim
by
the
promotion
of
his
first
officer
to
the
command
of
the
it
was
by
far
the
largest
craft
which
sailed
from
the
port
of
sunwich
and
its
master
held
a
corresponding
dignity
amongst
the
captains
of
lesser
vessels
their
allegiance
was
now
transferred
to
captain
hardy
and
the
master
of
a
brig
which
was
in
the
last
stages
of
senile
decay
meeting
nugent
in
the
goblets
actually
showed
him
by
means
of
two
lucifer
matches
how
the
collision
might
have
been
avoided
a
touching
feature
in
the
business
and
a
source
of
much
gratification
to
wilks
by
the
sentimental
applause
evoked
by
it
was
his
renunciation
of
the
post
of
steward
on
the
ss
sunwich
buzzed
with
the
tidings
that
after
eighteen
years
service
with
captain
nugent
he
preferred
starvation
ashore
to
serving
under
another
master
although
comfortable
in
pocket
and
known
to
be
living
with
his
mother
who
kept
a
small
general
shop
he
was
regarded
as
a
man
on
the
brink
of
starvation
pints
were
thrust
upon
him
and
the
tale
of
his
nobility
increased
with
much
narration
it
was
considered
that
the
whole
race
of
stewards
had
acquired
fresh
lustre
from
his
action
his
only
unfavourable
critic
was
the
erring
captain
himself
he
sent
a
peremptory
summons
to
wilks
to
attend
at
equator
lodge
and
the
moment
he
set
eyes
upon
that
piece
of
probity
embarked
upon
such
a
vilification
of
his
personal
defects
and
character
as
wilks
had
never
even
dreamt
of
he
wound
up
by
ordering
him
to
rejoin
the
ship
forthwith
arsking
your
pardon
sir
said
wilks
with
tender
reproach
but
i
could
are
you
going
to
live
on
your
mother
you
hulking
rascal
quoth
the
incensed
captain
no
sir
said
wilks
i
got
a
little
money
sir
enough
for
my
few
wants
till
we
sail
again
when
i
sail
again
you
wo
come
with
me
said
the
captain
grimly
i
suppose
you
want
an
excuse
for
a
soak
ashore
for
six
months
wilks
twiddled
his
cap
in
his
hands
and
smiled
weakly
i
thought
as
you
like
me
to
come
round
and
wait
at
table
and
help
with
the
knives
and
boots
and
he
said
softly
ann
is
agreeable
get
out
of
the
house
said
the
captain
in
quiet
measured
tones
wilks
went
but
on
his
way
to
the
gate
he
picked
up
three
pieces
of
paper
which
had
blown
into
the
garden
weeded
two
pieces
of
grass
from
the
path
and
carefully
removed
a
dead
branch
from
a
laurel
facing
the
window
he
would
have
done
more
but
for
an
imperative
knocking
on
the
glass
and
he
left
the
premises
sadly
putting
his
collection
of
rubbish
over
the
next
garden
fence
as
he
passed
it
but
the
next
day
the
captain
boots
bore
such
a
polish
that
he
was
able
to
view
his
own
startled
face
in
them
and
at
the
brightness
of
the
knives
was
so
conspicuous
that
kingdom
called
ann
in
for
the
purpose
of
asking
her
why
she
did
always
do
them
like
that
her
brother
ate
his
meal
in
silence
and
going
to
his
room
afterwards
discovered
every
pair
of
boots
he
possessed
headed
by
the
tall
standing
in
a
nicely
graduated
line
by
the
wall
and
all
shining
their
hardest
for
two
days
did
wilks
do
good
by
stealth
leaving
ann
to
blush
to
find
it
fame
but
on
the
third
day
at
dinner
as
the
captain
took
up
his
knife
and
fork
to
carve
he
became
aware
of
a
shadow
standing
behind
his
chair
a
shadow
in
a
blue
coat
with
metal
buttons
which
whipping
up
the
first
plate
carved
carried
it
to
kingdom
and
then
leaned
against
her
with
the
vegetable
dishes
the
dishes
clattered
a
little
on
his
arm
as
he
helped
the
captain
but
the
latter
after
an
impressive
pause
and
a
vain
attempt
to
catch
the
eye
of
wilks
which
was
intent
upon
things
afar
off
took
up
the
spoon
and
helped
himself
from
the
unwonted
silence
of
miss
nugent
in
the
presence
of
anything
unusual
it
was
clear
to
him
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
carefully
arranged
he
ate
in
silence
and
a
resolution
to
kick
wilks
off
the
premises
vanished
before
the
comfort
to
say
nothing
of
the
dignity
afforded
by
his
presence
wilks
somewhat
reassured
favoured
miss
nugent
with
a
wink
to
which
although
she
had
devoted
much
time
in
trying
to
acquire
the
art
she
endeavoured
in
vain
to
respond
it
was
on
the
day
following
this
that
jack
nugent
at
his
instigation
made
an
attempt
to
avenge
the
family
honour
miss
nugent
although
she
treated
him
with
scant
courtesy
herself
had
a
touching
faith
in
his
prowess
a
faith
partly
due
to
her
brother
occasionally
showing
her
his
bicep
muscles
in
moments
of
exaltation
there
that
horrid
jem
hardy
she
said
suddenly
as
they
walked
along
the
road
so
it
is
said
master
nugent
but
without
any
display
of
enthusiasm
halloa
jack
shouted
master
hardy
across
the
road
the
suspense
became
painful
halloa
responded
the
other
he
going
to
fight
you
shrilled
miss
nugent
who
thought
these
amenities
he
said
so
master
hardy
crossed
the
road
what
for
he
demanded
with
surprise
because
you
a
nasty
horrid
boy
replied
miss
nugent
drawing
herself
up
oh
said
master
hardy
blankly
the
two
gentlemen
stood
regarding
each
other
with
uneasy
grins
the
lady
stood
by
in
breathless
expectation
the
suspense
became
painful
illustration
the
suspense
became
painful
who
are
you
staring
at
demanded
master
nugent
at
last
you
replied
the
other
who
are
you
staring
at
you
said
master
nugent
defiantly
there
was
a
long
interval
both
gentlemen
experiencing
some
difficulty
in
working
up
sufficient
heat
for
the
engagement
you
hit
me
and
see
what
you
get
said
master
hardy
at
length
you
hit
me
said
the
other
cowardy
cowardy
custard
chanted
the
miss
nugent
ate
his
mother
mustard
cowardy
cowardy
cus
why
do
you
send
that
kid
home
demanded
master
hardy
eyeing
the
fair
songstress
with
strong
disfavour
you
leave
my
sister
alone
said
the
other
giving
him
a
light
tap
on
the
shoulder
there
your
coward
blow
master
hardy
made
a
ceremonious
return
there
yours
he
said
let
go
behind
the
church
his
foe
assented
and
they
proceeded
in
grave
silence
to
a
piece
of
grass
screened
by
trees
which
stood
between
the
church
and
the
beach
here
they
removed
their
coats
and
rolled
up
their
things
look
different
out
of
doors
and
to
miss
nugent
the
arms
of
both
gentlemen
seemed
somewhat
in
their
proportions
the
preliminaries
were
awful
both
combatants
prancing
round
each
other
with
their
faces
just
peering
above
their
bent
right
arms
while
their
trusty
lefts
dealt
vicious
blows
at
the
air
miss
nugent
turned
pale
and
caught
her
breath
at
each
blow
then
she
suddenly
reddened
with
wrath
as
james
philip
hardy
having
paid
his
tribute
to
science
began
to
hammer
john
augustus
nugent
about
the
face
in
a
most
painful
and
workmanlike
fashion
she
hid
her
face
for
a
moment
and
when
she
looked
again
jack
was
on
the
ground
and
master
hardy
just
rising
from
his
prostrate
body
then
jack
rose
slowly
and
crossing
over
to
her
borrowed
her
handkerchief
and
applied
it
with
great
tenderness
to
his
nose
does
it
hurt
jack
she
inquired
anxiously
no
growled
her
brother
he
threw
down
the
handkerchief
and
turned
to
his
opponent
again
miss
nugent
who
was
careful
about
her
property
stooped
to
recover
it
and
immediately
found
herself
involved
in
a
twisting
tangle
of
legs
from
which
she
escaped
by
a
miracle
to
see
master
hardy
cuddling
her
brother
round
the
neck
with
one
hand
and
punching
him
as
hard
and
as
fast
as
he
could
with
the
other
the
unfairness
of
it
maddened
her
and
the
next
moment
master
hardy
head
was
drawn
forcibly
backwards
by
the
hair
the
pain
was
so
excruciating
that
he
released
his
victim
at
once
and
miss
nugent
emitting
a
series
of
terrified
yelps
dashed
off
in
the
direction
of
home
her
hair
bobbing
up
and
down
on
her
shoulders
and
her
small
black
legs
in
an
ecstasy
of
motion
master
hardy
with
no
very
ideas
of
what
he
was
going
to
do
if
he
caught
her
started
in
pursuit
his
scalp
was
still
smarting
and
his
eyes
watering
with
the
pain
as
he
pounded
behind
her
panting
wildly
she
heard
him
coming
closer
and
closer
and
she
was
just
about
to
give
up
when
to
her
joy
she
saw
her
father
coming
towards
them
master
hardy
intent
on
his
quarry
saw
him
just
in
time
and
swerving
into
the
road
passed
in
safety
as
miss
nugent
flung
herself
with
some
violence
at
her
father
waistcoat
and
clinging
to
him
convulsively
fought
for
breath
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
furnish
the
astonished
captain
with
full
details
and
she
was
pleased
to
find
that
his
indignation
led
him
to
ignore
the
episode
on
which
to
do
her
justice
she
touched
but
lightly
that
evening
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
captain
nugent
after
some
deliberation
called
upon
his
late
mate
the
old
servant
who
since
hardy
death
the
year
before
had
looked
after
the
house
was
out
and
hardy
unaware
of
the
honour
intended
him
was
scandalized
by
the
manner
in
which
his
son
received
the
visitor
the
door
opened
there
was
an
involuntary
grunt
from
master
hardy
and
the
next
moment
he
sped
along
the
narrow
passage
and
darted
upstairs
his
father
after
waiting
in
vain
for
his
return
went
to
the
door
himself
good
evening
he
said
in
surprise
nugent
responded
gruffly
and
followed
him
into
the
to
an
invitation
to
sit
he
responded
more
gruffly
still
that
he
preferred
to
stand
he
then
demanded
instant
and
sufficient
punishment
of
master
hardy
for
frightening
his
daughter
even
as
he
spoke
he
noticed
with
strong
disfavour
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
his
late
first
officer
the
change
which
takes
place
when
a
man
is
promoted
from
that
rank
to
that
of
master
is
subtle
but
unmistakable
sometimes
as
in
the
present
instance
more
unmistakable
than
subtle
captain
hardy
coiled
his
long
sinewy
form
in
an
and
eyeing
him
calmly
lit
his
pipe
before
replying
illustration
captain
hardy
lit
his
pipe
before
replying
boys
will
fight
he
said
briefly
i
speaking
of
his
running
after
my
daughter
said
nugent
sternly
hardy
eyes
twinkled
young
dog
he
said
genially
at
his
age
too
captain
nugent
face
was
suffused
with
wrath
at
the
pleasantry
and
he
regarded
him
with
a
fixed
stare
on
board
the
there
was
a
witchery
in
that
glance
more
potent
than
the
spoken
word
but
in
his
own
parlour
the
new
captain
met
it
calmly
i
did
come
here
to
listen
to
your
foolery
said
nugent
i
came
to
tell
you
to
punish
that
boy
of
yours
and
i
do
it
replied
the
other
i
have
got
something
better
to
do
than
interfere
in
children
quarrels
i
have
got
your
spare
time
you
know
captain
nugent
turned
purple
such
language
from
his
late
first
officer
was
a
revelation
to
him
i
also
came
to
warn
you
he
said
furiously
that
i
shall
take
the
law
into
my
own
hands
if
you
refuse
aye
aye
said
hardy
with
careless
contempt
i
tell
him
to
keep
out
of
your
way
but
i
should
advise
you
to
wait
until
i
have
sailed
captain
nugent
who
was
moving
towards
the
door
swung
round
and
confronted
him
savagely
what
do
you
mean
he
demanded
what
i
say
retorted
captain
hardy
i
do
want
to
indulge
sunwich
with
the
spectacle
of
two
at
fisticuffs
but
that
what
happen
if
you
touch
my
boy
it
would
probably
please
the
spectators
more
than
it
would
us
i
cane
him
the
first
time
i
lay
hands
on
him
roared
captain
nugent
captain
hardy
stock
of
patience
was
at
an
end
and
there
was
moreover
a
long
and
undischarged
account
between
himself
and
his
late
skipper
he
rose
and
crossed
to
the
door
jem
he
cried
come
downstairs
and
show
captain
nugent
out
there
was
a
breathless
pause
captain
nugent
ground
his
teeth
with
fury
as
he
saw
the
challenge
and
realized
the
ridiculous
position
into
which
his
temper
had
led
him
and
the
other
who
was
also
careful
of
appearances
repented
the
order
the
moment
he
had
given
it
matters
had
now
however
passed
out
of
their
hands
and
both
men
cast
appraising
glances
at
each
other
form
the
only
one
who
kept
his
head
was
master
hardy
and
it
was
a
source
of
considerable
relief
to
both
of
them
when
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
voice
of
that
youthful
solomon
was
heard
declining
in
the
most
positive
terms
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
captain
hardy
repeated
his
command
the
only
reply
was
the
violent
closing
of
a
door
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
after
waiting
a
short
time
he
led
the
way
to
the
front
door
himself
you
will
regret
your
insolence
before
i
have
done
with
you
said
his
visitor
as
he
paused
on
the
step
it
the
old
story
of
a
beggar
on
horseback
it
a
good
story
said
captain
hardy
but
to
my
mind
it
does
come
up
to
the
one
about
chapter
iii
if
anything
was
wanted
to
convince
captain
nugent
that
his
action
had
been
foolish
and
his
language
intemperate
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
by
the
subsequent
behaviour
of
master
hardy
generosity
is
seldom
an
attribute
of
youth
while
egotism
on
the
other
hand
is
seldom
absent
so
far
from
realizing
that
the
captain
would
have
scorned
such
lowly
game
master
hardy
believed
that
he
lived
for
little
else
and
his
ubiquity
was
a
constant
marvel
and
discomfort
to
that
irritable
mariner
did
he
approach
a
seat
on
the
beach
it
was
master
hardy
who
rose
at
the
last
moment
to
make
room
for
him
did
he
stroll
down
to
the
harbour
it
was
in
the
wake
of
a
small
boy
looking
coyly
at
him
over
his
shoulder
every
small
alley
as
he
passed
seemed
to
contain
a
jem
hardy
who
whizzed
out
like
a
human
firework
in
front
of
him
and
then
followed
dancing
on
his
toes
a
pace
or
two
in
his
rear
this
was
on
on
the
sabbath
master
hardy
daring
ingenuity
led
him
to
still
further
flights
all
the
seats
at
the
parish
church
were
free
but
captain
nugent
whose
admirable
practice
it
was
to
take
his
entire
family
to
church
never
thoroughly
realized
how
free
they
were
until
master
hardy
squeezed
his
way
in
and
taking
a
seat
next
to
him
prayed
with
unwonted
fervour
into
the
interior
of
a
new
hat
and
then
sitting
back
watched
with
polite
composure
the
efforts
of
miss
family
to
her
growing
excitement
charmed
with
the
experiment
he
repeated
it
the
following
sunday
this
time
he
boarded
the
seat
from
the
other
end
and
seeing
no
place
by
the
captain
took
one
or
more
correctly
speaking
made
one
between
miss
nugent
and
jack
and
despite
the
former
elbow
began
to
feel
almost
like
one
of
the
family
hostile
feelings
vanished
and
with
an
amiable
smile
at
the
miss
nugent
he
placed
a
of
great
strength
in
his
cheek
and
leaning
forward
for
a
left
one
on
the
ledge
in
front
of
jack
a
perfume
at
once
assailed
the
atmosphere
miss
nugent
sat
dazed
at
his
impudence
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
doubts
as
to
her
father
capacity
stirred
within
her
she
attempted
the
poor
consolation
of
an
acid
tablet
and
it
was
at
once
impounded
by
the
watchful
kingdom
the
reek
of
was
insufferable
the
service
seemed
interminable
and
all
that
time
the
indignant
damsel
wedged
in
between
her
aunt
and
the
openly
exultant
enemy
of
her
house
was
compelled
to
endure
in
silence
she
did
indeed
attempt
one
remark
and
master
hardy
with
a
horrified
expression
of
outraged
piety
said
and
shook
his
head
at
her
it
was
almost
more
than
flesh
and
blood
could
bear
and
when
the
unobservant
kingdom
asked
her
for
the
text
on
the
way
home
her
reply
nearly
cost
her
the
loss
of
her
dinner
the
under
its
new
commander
sailed
on
the
day
following
wilks
watched
it
from
the
quay
and
the
new
steward
observing
him
came
to
the
side
and
holding
aloft
an
old
between
his
finger
and
thumb
until
he
had
attracted
his
attention
dropped
it
overboard
with
every
circumstance
of
exaggerated
horror
by
the
time
a
suitable
retort
had
occurred
to
the
the
steamer
was
half
a
mile
distant
and
the
extraordinary
and
unnatural
pantomime
in
which
he
indulged
on
the
edge
of
the
quay
was
grievously
misinterpreted
by
a
nervous
man
in
a
sailing
boat
illustration
wilks
watched
it
from
the
quay
master
hardy
had
also
seen
the
ship
out
and
perched
on
the
extreme
end
of
the
breakwater
he
remained
watching
until
she
was
hull
down
on
the
horizon
then
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
town
and
the
nearest
confectioner
and
started
for
home
just
as
miss
nugent
who
was
about
to
pay
a
call
with
her
aunt
waited
beautifully
dressed
in
the
front
garden
while
that
lady
completed
her
preparations
feeling
very
spic
and
span
and
still
a
trifle
uncomfortable
from
the
vigorous
attentions
of
ann
who
cleansed
her
as
though
she
had
been
a
doorstep
she
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
path
upon
these
occasions
of
high
dress
a
spirit
of
sabbath
calm
was
wont
to
descend
upon
her
and
save
her
from
escapades
to
which
in
a
less
severe
garb
she
was
somewhat
prone
she
stopped
at
the
gate
and
looked
up
the
road
then
her
face
flushed
and
she
cast
her
eyes
behind
her
to
make
sure
that
the
stood
open
the
hated
scion
of
the
house
of
hardy
was
coming
down
the
road
and
in
view
of
that
fact
she
forgot
all
else
even
her
manners
the
boy
still
fresh
from
the
loss
of
his
natural
protector
kept
a
wary
eye
on
the
house
as
he
approached
then
all
expression
died
out
of
his
face
and
he
passed
the
gate
blankly
ignoring
the
small
girl
who
was
leaning
over
it
and
apparently
suffering
from
elephantiasis
of
the
tongue
he
went
by
quietly
and
miss
nugent
raging
inwardly
that
she
had
misbehaved
to
no
purpose
withdrew
her
tongue
for
more
legitimate
uses
boo
she
cried
who
had
his
hair
pulled
master
hardy
pursued
the
even
tenor
of
his
way
who
afraid
to
answer
me
for
fear
my
father
will
thrash
him
cried
the
disappointed
lady
raising
her
voice
this
was
too
much
the
enemy
retraced
his
steps
and
came
up
to
the
gate
you
a
rude
little
girl
he
said
with
an
insufferably
air
who
had
his
hair
pulled
demanded
miss
nugent
capering
wildly
who
had
his
hair
pulled
do
be
silly
said
master
hardy
here
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
producing
some
nuts
offered
them
over
the
gate
at
this
miss
nugent
ceased
her
capering
and
wrath
possessed
her
that
the
enemy
should
thus
misunderstand
the
gravity
of
the
situation
well
give
to
jack
then
pursued
the
boy
he
wo
say
no
this
was
a
distinct
reflection
on
jack
loyalty
and
her
indignation
was
not
lessened
by
the
fact
that
she
knew
it
was
true
go
away
from
our
gate
she
stormed
if
my
father
catches
you
suffer
pooh
said
the
he
looked
up
at
the
house
and
then
opening
the
gate
strode
boldly
into
the
front
garden
before
this
intrusion
miss
nugent
retreated
in
alarm
and
gaining
the
gazed
at
him
in
dismay
then
her
face
cleared
suddenly
and
master
hardy
looking
over
his
shoulder
saw
that
his
retreat
was
cut
off
by
wilks
do
let
him
hurt
me
sam
entreated
miss
nugent
piteously
wilks
came
into
the
garden
and
closed
the
gate
behind
him
i
was
going
to
hurt
her
cried
master
hardy
anxiously
as
if
i
should
hurt
a
girl
wot
are
you
doing
in
our
front
garden
then
demanded
wilks
he
sprang
forward
suddenly
and
catching
the
boy
by
the
collar
with
one
huge
hand
dragged
him
struggling
violently
down
the
into
the
back
garden
miss
nugent
following
close
behind
sought
to
improve
the
occasion
see
what
you
get
by
coming
into
our
garden
she
said
the
victim
made
no
reply
he
was
writhing
strenuously
in
order
to
frustrate
wilks
evident
desire
to
arrange
him
comfortably
for
the
administration
of
the
stick
he
was
carrying
satisfied
at
last
the
raised
his
weapon
and
for
some
seconds
plied
it
briskly
miss
nugent
trembled
but
sternly
repressing
sympathy
for
the
sufferer
was
pleased
that
the
long
arm
of
justice
had
at
last
him
let
him
go
now
sam
she
said
he
crying
i
not
yelled
master
hardy
frantically
i
can
see
the
tears
declared
miss
nugent
bending
wilks
plied
the
rod
again
until
his
victim
with
a
sudden
turn
fetched
him
a
violent
kick
on
the
shin
and
broke
loose
the
set
off
in
pursuit
somewhat
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
he
dare
not
go
over
whilst
master
hardy
was
singularly
free
from
such
prejudices
miss
nugent
ran
to
the
to
cut
off
his
retreat
she
was
willing
for
him
to
be
released
but
not
to
escape
and
so
it
fell
out
that
the
boy
dodging
beneath
wilks
outspread
arms
charged
blindly
up
the
and
bowled
the
young
lady
over
there
was
a
shrill
squeal
a
flutter
of
white
and
a
neat
pair
of
button
boots
waving
in
the
air
then
miss
nugent
sobbing
piteously
rose
from
the
puddle
into
which
she
had
fallen
and
surveyed
her
garments
wilks
surveyed
them
too
and
a
very
cursory
glance
was
sufficient
to
show
him
that
the
case
was
beyond
his
powers
he
took
the
outraged
damsel
by
the
hand
and
led
her
howling
lustily
in
to
the
horrified
ann
my
word
said
she
gasping
look
at
your
gloves
look
at
your
frock
but
miss
nugent
was
looking
at
her
knees
there
was
only
a
slight
redness
about
the
left
but
from
the
right
a
piece
of
skin
was
indubitably
missing
this
knee
she
gave
ann
instructions
to
foment
with
fair
water
of
a
comfortable
temperature
indulging
in
satisfied
prognostications
as
to
the
fate
of
master
hardy
when
her
father
should
see
the
damage
the
news
when
the
captain
came
home
was
broken
to
him
by
degrees
he
was
first
shown
the
by
ann
then
kingdom
brought
in
various
soiled
garments
and
at
the
psychological
moment
his
daughter
bared
her
knees
what
will
you
do
to
him
father
she
inquired
the
captain
ignored
the
question
in
favour
of
a
few
remarks
on
the
subject
of
his
daughter
behaviour
coupled
with
stern
inquiries
as
to
where
she
learnt
such
tricks
in
reply
miss
nugent
sheltered
herself
behind
a
list
which
contained
the
names
of
all
the
young
gentlemen
who
attended
her
kindergarten
class
and
many
of
the
young
ladies
and
again
inquired
as
to
the
fate
of
her
assailant
jack
came
in
soon
after
and
the
indefatigable
miss
nugent
produced
her
knees
again
she
had
to
describe
the
injury
to
the
left
but
the
right
spoke
for
itself
jack
gazed
at
it
with
indignation
and
then
without
waiting
for
his
tea
put
on
his
cap
and
sallied
out
again
he
returned
an
hour
later
and
instead
of
entering
the
went
straight
upstairs
to
bed
from
whence
he
sent
down
word
by
the
sympathetic
ann
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
bad
headache
which
he
proposed
to
treat
with
raw
meat
applied
to
the
left
eye
his
nose
which
was
apparently
suffering
from
sympathetic
inflammation
he
left
to
take
care
of
itself
that
organ
bitterly
resenting
any
treatment
whatsoever
he
described
the
battle
to
kate
and
ann
the
next
day
darkly
ascribing
his
defeat
to
a
mysterious
compound
which
jem
hardy
was
believed
to
rub
into
his
arms
to
a
foolish
error
of
judgment
at
the
beginning
of
the
fray
and
to
the
sun
which
shone
persistently
in
his
eyes
all
the
time
his
audience
received
the
explanations
in
chilly
silence
and
he
said
it
was
an
accident
he
knocked
you
down
he
concluded
he
said
he
hoped
you
were
hurt
and
he
gave
me
some
toffee
for
you
what
did
you
do
with
it
demanded
miss
nugent
i
knew
you
would
have
it
replied
her
brother
inconsequently
and
there
was
much
of
it
his
sister
regarded
him
sharply
you
do
mean
to
say
you
ate
it
she
screamed
why
not
demanded
her
brother
i
wanted
comforting
i
can
tell
you
i
wonder
you
were
not
too
too
proud
said
miss
nugent
bitterly
i
never
too
proud
to
eat
toffee
retorted
jack
simply
he
stalked
off
in
dudgeon
at
the
lack
of
sympathy
displayed
by
his
audience
and
being
still
in
need
of
comforting
sought
it
amid
the
his
father
noted
his
son
honourable
scars
but
made
no
comment
as
to
any
action
on
his
own
part
he
realized
to
the
full
the
impotence
of
a
and
dignified
citizen
when
confronted
by
lawless
youth
but
master
hardy
came
to
church
no
more
indeed
the
following
sunday
he
was
fully
occupied
on
the
beach
enacting
the
part
of
david
after
first
impressing
the
raving
wilks
into

master
hardy
on
the
beach
enacting
the
part
of
david
chapter
iv
for
the
next
month
or
two
master
hardy
existence
was
brightened
by
the
efforts
of
an
elderly
steward
who
made
no
secret
of
his
intentions
of
putting
an
end
to
it
wilks
at
first
placed
great
reliance
on
the
saw
that
it
is
the
early
bird
that
catches
the
worm
but
lost
faith
in
it
when
he
found
that
it
made
no
provision
for
cases
in
which
the
worm
leaning
from
its
bedroom
window
addressed
spirited
remonstrances
to
the
bird
on
the
subject
of
its
personal
appearance
to
the
anxious
inquiries
of
miss
nugent
wilks
replied
that
he
was
biding
his
time
every
delay
he
hinted
made
it
worse
for
master
hardy
when
the
day
of
retribution
should
dawn
and
although
she
pleaded
earnestly
for
a
little
on
account
he
was
unable
to
meet
her
wishes
before
that
day
came
however
captain
nugent
heard
of
the
proceedings
and
after
a
painful
interview
with
the
steward
during
which
the
failings
by
no
means
escaped
attention
confined
him
to
the
house
illustration
wilks
replied
that
he
was
biding
his
time
an
excellent
reason
for
absenting
himself
from
school
was
thus
denied
to
master
hardy
but
it
has
been
well
said
that
when
one
door
closes
another
opens
and
to
his
great
satisfaction
the
old
servant
who
had
been
in
poor
health
for
some
time
suddenly
took
to
her
bed
and
required
his
undivided
attention
he
treated
her
at
first
with
patent
medicines
purchased
at
the
chemist
a
doctor
being
regarded
by
both
of
them
as
a
piece
of
unnecessary
extravagance
but
in
spite
of
four
infallible
remedies
she
got
steadily
worse
then
a
doctor
was
called
in
and
by
the
time
captain
hardy
returned
home
she
had
made
a
partial
recovery
but
was
clearly
incapable
of
further
work
she
left
in
a
cab
to
accept
a
home
with
a
niece
leaving
the
captain
confronted
with
a
problem
which
he
had
seen
growing
for
some
time
past
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
with
you
he
observed
regarding
his
son
i
very
comfortable
was
the
reply
you
too
comfortable
said
his
father
you
running
wild
it
just
as
well
poor
old
martha
has
gone
it
has
brought
things
to
a
head
we
could
have
somebody
else
suggested
his
son
the
captain
shook
his
head
i
give
up
the
house
and
send
you
to
london
to
your
aunt
mary
he
said
slowly
she
does
know
you
and
once
i
at
sea
and
the
house
given
up
she
wo
be
able
to
send
you
back
master
hardy
who
was
much
averse
to
leaving
sunwich
and
had
heard
accounts
of
the
lady
in
question
which
referred
principally
to
her
strength
of
mind
made
tender
inquiries
concerning
his
father
comfort
while
ashore
i
take
rooms
was
the
reply
and
i
shall
spend
as
much
time
as
i
can
with
you
in
london
you
want
looking
after
my
son
i
heard
all
about
you
his
son
without
inquiring
as
to
the
nature
of
the
information
denied
it
at
once
upon
principle
he
also
alluded
darkly
to
his
education
and
shook
his
head
over
the
effects
of
a
change
at
such
a
critical
period
of
his
existence
and
you
talk
too
much
for
your
age
was
his
father
comment
when
he
had
finished
a
year
or
two
with
your
aunt
ought
to
make
a
nice
boy
of
you
there
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
he
put
his
plans
in
hand
at
once
and
a
week
before
he
sailed
again
had
disposed
of
the
house
some
of
the
furniture
he
kept
for
himself
but
the
bulk
of
it
went
to
his
sister
as
master
hardy
in
very
low
spirits
watched
it
taken
away
big
men
in
boots
ran
noisily
up
the
bare
stairs
and
came
down
slowly
steering
large
pieces
of
furniture
through
narrow
passages
and
using
much
vain
repetition
when
they
found
their
hands
acting
as
fenders
the
wardrobe
a
piece
of
furniture
which
had
been
built
for
larger
premises
was
a
particularly
hard
nut
to
crack
but
they
succeeded
at
last
in
three
places
illustration
a
particularly
hard
nut
to
crack
a
few
of
his
intimates
came
down
to
see
the
last
of
him
and
miss
nugent
who
in
some
feminine
fashion
regarded
the
move
as
a
triumph
for
her
family
passed
by
several
times
it
might
have
been
chance
it
might
have
been
design
but
the
boy
could
not
help
noticing
that
when
the
piano
the
wardrobe
and
other
fine
pieces
were
being
placed
in
the
van
she
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
road
a
position
from
which
such
curios
as
a
broken
washstand
or
a
chair
never
failed
to
entice
her
it
was
over
at
last
the
second

had
disappeared
and
nothing
was
left
but
a
litter
of
straw
and
paper

open

nugent

to
the
gate
and
stared
in
superciliously
i
glad
you
going
she
said
frankly
master
hardy
scarcely
noticed
her
one
of
his
friends
who
concealed
strong
business
instincts
beneath
a
sentimental
exterior
had
suggested
souvenirs
and
given
him
a
said
to
have
belonged
to
henry
and
he
was
busy
searching
his
pockets
for
an
adequate
return
then
captain
hardy
came
up
and
first
going
over
the
empty
house
came
out
and
bade
his
son
accompany
him
to
the
station
a
minute
or
two
later
and
they
were
out
of
sight
the
sentimentalist
stood
on
the
curb
gloating
over
a
newly
acquired
penknife
and
miss
nugent
after
being
strongly
reproved
by
him
for
curiosity
paced
slowly
home
with
her
head
in
the
air
sunwich
made
no
stir
over
the
departure
of
one
of
its
youthful
citizens
indeed
it
lacked
not
those
who
would
have
cheerfully
parted
with
two
or
three
hundred
more
the
boy
was
quite
chilled
by
the
tameness
of
his
exit
and
for
years
afterwards
the
desolate
appearance
of
the
platform
as
the
train
steamed
out
occurred
to
him
with
an
odd
sense
of
discomfort
in
all
sunwich
there
was
only
one
person
who
grieved
over
his
departure
and
he
after
keeping
his
memory
green
for
two
years
wrote
off
fivepence
as
a
bad
debt
and
dismissed
him
from
his
thoughts

months

describing
it

pressed
for
details

could
only
murmur
disjointedly
of

brass

crimson
velvet
jack
nugent
hailed
his
father
departure
with
joy
they
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
each
other
during
the
latter
prolonged
stay
ashore
and
neither
had
risen
in
the
other
estimation
in
consequence
he
became
enthusiastic
over
the
sea
as
a
profession
for
fathers
and
gave
himself
some
airs
over
acquaintances
less
fortunately
placed
in
the
first
flush
of
liberty
he
took
to
staying
away
from
school
the
education
thus
lost
being
only
partially
atoned
for
by
a
style
of
composition
engendered
by
dictating
excuses
to
the
kingdom
at
seventeen
he
learnt
somewhat
to
his
surprise
that
his
education
was
finished
his
father
provided
the
information
and
simply
as
a
matter
of
form
consulted
him
as
to
his
views
for
the
future
it
was
an
important
thing
to
decide
upon
at
short
notice
but
he
was
equal
to
it
and
having
suggested
as
the
only
profession
he
cared
for
was
promptly
provided
by
the
incensed
captain
with
a
stool
in
the
local
bank
illustration
a
stool
in
the
local
bank
he
occupied
it
for
three
weeks
a
period
of
time
which
coincided
to
a
day
with
his
father
leave
ashore
he
left
behind
him
his
initials
cut
deeply
in
the
lid
of
his
desk
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
cheap
fiction
and
a
few
experiments
in
which
the
manager
ultimately
solved
with
red
ink
and
a
ruler
a
slight
uneasiness
as
to
the
wisdom
of
his
proceedings
occurred
to
him
just
before
his
father
return
but
he
comforted
himself
and
kate
with
the
undeniable
truth
that
after
all
the
captain
could
eat
him
he
was
afraid
however
that
the
latter
would
be
displeased
and
with
a
constitutional
objection
to
unpleasantness
he
contrived
to
be
out
when
he
returned
leaving
to
kingdom

task
of
breaking
the
news
the
captain
reply
was
brief
and
to
the
point
he
asked
his
son
whether
he
would
like
to
go
to
sea
and
upon
receiving
a
decided
answer
in
the
negative
at
once
took
steps
to
send
him
there
in
two
days

had
procured
him
an
outfit
and
within
a
week
jack
nugent
greatly
to
his
own
surprise
was
on
the
way
to
melbourne
as
apprentice
on
the
barque
he
liked
it
even
less
than
the
bank
the
monotony
of
the
sea
was
appalling
to
a
youth
of
his
tastes
and
the
fact
that
the
skipper
a
man
who
never
spoke
except
to
find
fault
was
almost
loquacious
with
him
failed
to
afford
him
any
satisfaction
he
liked
the
mates
no
better
than
the
skipper
and
having
said
as
much
one
day
to
the
second
officer
had
no
reason
afterwards
to
modify
his
opinions
he
lived
a
life
apart
and
except
for
the
cook
another
martyr
to
had
no
society
in
these
uncongenial
circumstances
the
new
apprentice
worked
for
four
months
as
he
had
never
believed
it
possible
he
could
work
he
was
annoyed
both
at
the
extent
and
the
variety
of
his
tasks
the
work
of
an
being
gratuitously
included
in
his
curriculum
the
end
of
the
voyage
found
him
desperate
and
after
a
hasty
consultation
with
the
cook
they
deserted
together
and
went
letters
dealing
mainly
with
the
ideas
and
adventures
of
the
cook

sunwich
at
irregular
intervals
and
were
eagerly
perused
by
kingdom

stared
but
made
no

disappointed
in
his
son
he
turned
for
consolation
to
his
daughter
noting
with
some
concern
the
unaccountable
changes
which
that
young
lady
underwent
during
his
absences
he
noticed
a
difference
after
every
voyage

left
behind
him
on
one
occasion
a
nice
trim
little
girl
and
returned
to
find
a
creature
all
legs
and
arms
he
returned
again
and
found
the
arms
less
obnoxious
and
the
legs
hidden
by
a
long
skirt
and
as
he
complained
in
secret
astonishment
to
his
sister
she
had
developed
a
motherly
manner
in
her
dealings
with
him
which
was
almost
unbearable
she
grow
out
of
it
soon
said
kingdom
you
wait
and
see
the
captain
growled
and
waited
and
found
his
sister
prognostications
partly
fulfilled
the
exuberance
of
miss
nugent
manner
was
certainly
modified
by
time
but
she
developed
instead
a
quiet
unassuming
habit
of
authority
which
he
liked
as
little
she
gets
made
such
a
fuss
of
it
no
wonder
said
kingdom
with
a
satisfied
smile
i
never
heard
of
a
girl
getting
as
much
attention
as
she
does
it
a
wonder
her
head
is
turned
eh
said
the
startled
captain
she
better
not
let
me
see
anything
of
it
just
so
said
kingdom
the
captain
dwelt
on
these
words
and
kept
his
eyes
open
and
owing
to
his
daughter
benevolent
efforts
on
his
behalf
had
them
fully
occupied
he
went
to
sea
firmly
convinced
that
she
would
do
something
foolish
in
the
matrimonial
line
the
glowing
terms
in
which
he
had
overheard
her
describing
the
charms
of
the
new
postman
to
kingdom
filling
him
with
the
direst
forebodings
it
was
his
last
voyage
an
unexpected
windfall
from
an
almost
forgotten
uncle
and
his
own
investments
had
placed
him
in
a
position
of
modest
comfort
and
just
before
miss
nugent
reached
her
twentieth
birthday
he
resolved
to
spend
his
declining
days
ashore
and
give
her
those
advantages
of
parental
attention
from
which
she
had
been
so
long
debarred
wilks
to
the
inconsolable
grief
of
his
left
with
him
he
had
been
for
nearly
a
couple
of
years
in
receipt
of
an
annuity
purchased
for
him
under
the
will
of
his
mother
and
his
defection
left
a
gap
never
to
be
filled
among
comrades
who
had
for
some
time
regarded
him
in
the
light
of
an
improved
drinking
fountain
chapter
v
on
a
fine
afternoon
some
two
months
after
his
release
from
the
toils
of
the
sea
captain
nugent
sat
in
the
special
parlour
of
the
goblets
the
old
inn
offers
hospitality
to
all
but
one
parlour
has
by
ancient
tradition
and
the
exercise
of
and
proper
feeling
been
from
time
immemorial
reserved
for
the
elite
of
the
town
the
captain
confident
in
the
security
of
these
unwritten
regulations
conversed
freely
with
his
peers
he
had
been
moved
to
speech
by
the
utter
absence
of
discipline
ashore
and
from
that
had
wandered
to
the
growing
evil
of
revolutionary
ideas
at
sea
his
remarks
were
much
applauded
and
two
listened
with
grave
respect
to
a
disquisition
on
the
wrongs
of
shipmasters
ensuing
on
the
fancied
rights
of
sailor
men
the
only
discordant
note
being
struck
by
the
a
man
whose
ideas
had
probably
been
insidiously
sapped
by
a
long
residence
ashore
a
man
before
the
mast
said
the
latter
fortifying
his
moral
courage
with
whisky
is
a
human
being
nobody
denies
it
said
captain
nugent
looking
round
one
captain
agreed
with
him
why
do
they
act
like
it
then
demanded
the
other
nugent
and
the
first
captain
struck
by
the
thought
they
had
perhaps
been
too
hasty
in
their
admission
and
waited
for
number
two
to
continue
they
eyed
him
with
silent
encouragement
why
do
they
act
like
it
then
repeated
number
two
who
being
a
man
of
few
ideas
was
not
disposed
to
waste
them
captain
nugent
and
his
friend
turned
to
the
to
see
how
he
would
meet
this
poser
they
mostly
do
he
replied
sturdily
treat
a
seaman
well
and
treat
you
well
this
was
rank
heresy
and
moreover
seemed
to
imply
something
captain
nugent
wondered
dismally
whether
life
ashore
would
infect
him
with
the
same
opinions
what
about
that
man
of
mine
who
threw
a
at
me
the
quailed
at
the
challenge
the
obvious
retort
was
offensive
i
shall
carry
the
mark
with
me
to
my
grave
added
the
captain
as
a
further
inducement
to
him
to
reply
i
hope
that
you
carry
it
a
long
time
said
the
gracefully

look
here
hall
expostulated
captain
number
two
starting
up
it
all
right
cooper
said
nugent
it
all
right
said
captain
number
one
and
in
a
rash
moment
undertook
to
explain
in
five
minutes
he
had
clouded
captain
cooper
intellect
for
the
afternoon
he
was
still
busy
with
his
task
when
a
diversion
was
created
by
the
entrance
of
a
new
arrival
a
short
stout
man
stood
for
a
moment
with
the
handle
of
the
door
in
his
hand
and
then
came
in
carefully
bearing
before
him
a
glass
of
gin
and
water
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
set
foot
there
and
all
understood
that
by
this
intrusion
daniel
kybird
sought
to
place
and
other
dignitaries
on
a
footing
with
the
keepers
of
and
dealers
in
old
clothes
in
the
midst
of
an
impressive
silence
he
set
his
glass
upon
the
table
and
taking
a
chair
drew
a
small
clay
pipe
from
his
pocket
illustration
a
diversion
was
created
by
the
entrance
of
a
new
arrival
aghast
at
the
intrusion
the
quartette
conferred
with
their
eyes
a
language
which
is
perhaps
only
successful
in
love
captain
cooper
who
was
usually
moved
to
speech
by
externals
was
the
first
to
speak
you
got
a
sty
coming
on
your
eye
hall
he
remarked
i
daresay
if
anybody
got
a
needle
said
the
captain
who
loved
minor
operations
nobody
heeded
him
except
the
and
he
muttered
something
about
beams
and
motes
which
the
captain
failed
to
understand
the
others
were
glaring
darkly
at
kybird
who
had
taken
up
a
newspaper
and
was
busy
perusing
it
are
you
looking
for
anybody
demanded
captain
nugent
at
last
no
said
kybird
looking
at
him
over
the
top
of
his
paper
what
have
you
come
here
for
then
inquired
the
captain
i
come
to
drink
two
o
gin
cold
returned
kybird
with
a
dignity
befitting
the
occupation
well
suppose
you
drink
it
somewhere
else
suggested
the
captain
kybird
had
another
supposition
to
offer
suppose
i
do
he
remarked
i
a
british
tradesman
and
my
money
is
as
good
as
yours
i
as
much
right
to
be
here
as
you
i
never
done
anything
i
ashamed
of
and
you
never
will
said
captain
cooper
friend
grimly
not
if
you
live
to
be
a
hundred
kybird
looked
surprised
at
the
tribute
thankee
he
said
gratefully
well
we
do
want
you
here
said
captain
nugent
we
prefer
your
room
to
your
company
kybird
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
twisted
his
blunt
features
into
an
expression
of
withering
contempt
then
he
took
up
a
glass
and
drank
and
discovered
too
late
that
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
had
made
free
with
the
speaker
whisky
do
apologize
interrupted
the
captain
it
soon
remedied
he
took
the
glass
up
gingerly
and
flung
it
with
a
crash
into
the
fireplace
then
he
rang
the
bell
i
smashed
a
dirty
glass
he
said
as
the
entered
how
much
the
man
told
him
and
the
captain
after
a
few
stern
remarks
about
privacy
and
harpies
left
the
room
with
his
friends
leaving
the
speechless
kybird
gazing
at
the
broken
glass
and
returning
evasive
replies
to
the
inquiries
of
the
curious
charles
he
finished
his
gin
and
water
slowly
for
months
he
had
been
screwing
up
his
courage
to
carry
that
room
by
assault
and
this
was
the
result
he
had
been
insulted
almost
in
the
very
face
of
charles
a
youth
whose
reputation
as
a
gossip
was
second
to
none
in
sunwich
do
you
know
what
i
should
do
if
i
was
you
said
that
worthy
as
he
entered
the
room
again
and
swept
up
the
broken
glass
i
do
not
said
kybird
with
lofty
indifference
i
should
come
again
that
what
i
should
do
said
charles
frankly
next
time
he
throw
you
in
the
fireplace
ho
said
the
heated
kybird
ho
will
he
i
like
to
see
i
make
sorry
for
this
afore
i
done
with
i
learn
to
insult
a
respectable
british
tradesman
i
show
him
who
who
what
you
do
inquired
the
other
never
you
mind
said
kybird
who
was
not
in
a
position
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
never
you
mind
you
go
and
get
on
with
your
work
charles
and
by
the
time
your
moustache
grown
big
enough
to
be
seen
you
something
i
something
the
other
day
said
the
musingly
about
you
it
was
but
i
would
believe
it
wot
was
it
demanded
the
other
nothing
much
replied
charles
standing
with
his
hand
on
the
but
i
would
believe
it
of
you
i
said
i
could
wot
was
it
insisted
kybird
why
they
said
you
once
gave
a
man
a
fair
price
for
a
pair
of
trousers
said
the
barman
indignantly
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
softly
and
kybird
after
a
brief
pause
opened
it
again
and
more
softly
still
quitted
the
precincts
of
the
goblets
and
stepped
across
the
road
to
his
emporium
illustration
he
stepped
across
the
road
to
his
emporium
captain
nugent
in
happy
ignorance
of
the
dark
designs
of
the
wardrobe
dealer
had
also
gone
home
he
was
only
just
beginning
to
realize
the
comparative
unimportance
of
a
retired
shipmaster
and
the
knowledge
was
a
source
of
considerable
annoyance
to
him
no
deferential
mates
listened
respectfully
to
his
instructions
no
sturdy
seaman
ran
to
execute
his
commands
or
trembled
mutinously
at
his
wrath
the
only
person
in
the
wide
world
who
stood
in
awe
of
him
was
the
general
servant
bella
and
she
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
her
satisfaction
at
the
attention
excited
by
her
shortcomings
he
paused
a
moment
at
the
gate
and
then
walking
slowly
up
to
the
door
gave
it
the
knock
of
a
master
a
full
minute
passing
he
knocked
again
remembering
with
some
misgivings
his
stern
instructions
of
the
day
before
that
the
door
was
to
be
attended
by
the
servant
and
by
nobody
else
he
had
seen
miss
nugent
sitting
at
the
window
as
he
passed
it
but
in
the
circumstances
the
fact
gave
him
no
comfort
a
third
knock
was
followed
by
a
fourth
and
then
a
distressed
voice
upstairs
was
heard
calling
wildly
upon
the
name
of
bella
at
the
fifth
knock
the
house
shook
and
a
maid
with
her
shoulders
veiled
in
a
large
damp
towel
passed
hastily
down
the
staircase
and
slipping
the
catch
passed
more
hastily
still
upstairs
again
affording
the
indignant
captain
a
glimpse
of
a
short
striped
skirt
as
it
turned
the
landing
is
there
any
management
at
all
in
this
house
he
inquired
as
he
entered
the
room
bella
was
dressing
said
miss
nugent
calmly
and
you
gave
orders
yesterday
that
nobody
else
was
to
open
the
door
nobody
else
when
she
available
qualified
her
father
eyeing
her
sharply
when
i
give
orders
i
expect
people
to
use
their
common
sense
why
is
my
tea
ready
it
five
the
clock
twenty
minutes
fast
said
kate
who
been
meddling
with
it
demanded
her
father
verifying
the
fact
by
his
watch
miss
nugent
shook
her
head
it
gained
that
since
you
regulated
it
last
night
she
said
with
a
smile
the
captain
threw
himself
into
an
and
with
one
eye
on
the
clock
waited
until
at
five
minutes
to
the
hour
by
the
right
time
a
clatter
of
crockery
sounded
from
the
kitchen
and
bella
still
damp
came
in
with
the
tray
her
eye
was
also
on
the
clock
and
she
smirked
weakly
in
the
captain
direction
as
she
saw
that
she
was
at
least
two
minutes
ahead
of
time
at
a
minute
to
the
hour
the
teapot
itself
was
on
the
tray
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
handmaiden
in
the
kitchen
was
audible
to
all
punctual
to
the
minute
john
said
kingdom
as
she
took
her
seat
at
the
tray
it
wonderful
how
that
girl
has
improved
since
been
at
home
she
is
like
the
same
girl
she
raised
the
teapot
and
after
pouring
out
a
little
of
the
contents
put
it
down
again
and
gave
it
another
two
minutes
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
colour
being
of
the
same
unsatisfactory
paleness
she
set
the
pot
down
and
was
about
to
raise
the
lid
when
an
avalanche
burst
into
the
room
and
emptying
some
tea
into
the
pot
from
a
beat
a
hasty
good
tea
and
servants
muttered
the
captain
to
his
plate
what
more
can
a
man
want
kingdom
coughed
and
passed
his
cup
miss
nugent
who
possessed
a
healthy
appetite
serenely
attacked
her
bread
and
butter
conversation
languished
i
suppose
you
heard
the
news
john
said
his
sister
i
daresay
i
have
was
the
reply
strange
he
should
come
back
after
all
these
years
said
kingdom
though
to
be
sure
i
do
know
why
he
should
it
his
native
place
and
his
father
lives
here
who
are
you
talking
about
inquired
the
captain
why
james
hardy
replied
his
sister
i
thought
you
said
you
had
heard
he
coming
back
to
sunwich
and
going
into
partnership
with
old
swann
the
shipbroker
a
very
good
thing
for
him
i
should
think
i
not
interested
in
the
doings
of
the
hardys
said
the
captain
gruffly
i
sure
i
not
said
his
sister
defensively
captain
nugent
proceeded
with
his
meal
in
silence
his
hatred
of
hardy
had
not
been
lessened
by
the
success
which
had
attended
that
career
and
was
not
likely
to
be
improved
by
the
of
hardy
junior
he
passed
his
cup
for
some
more
tea
and
with
a
furtive
glance
at
the
photograph
on
the
mantelpiece
wondered
what
had
happened
to
his
own
son
i
do
suppose
i
should
know
him
if
i
saw
him
continued
kingdom
addressing
a
respectable
old
london
is
sure
to
have
changed
him
is
this
inquired
the
captain
looking
up
from
his
plate
yes
why
said
kingdom
i
only
wanted
information
said
her
brother
as
he
deposited
the
salad
in
question
in
the
kingdom
with
a
resigned
expression
tried
to
catch
her
niece
eye
and
caught
the
captain
instead
miss
nugent
happening
to
glance
up
saw
her
fascinated
by
the
basilisk
glare
of
the
master
of
the
house
some
more
tea
please
she
said
her
aunt
took
her
cup
and
in
gratitude
for
the
diversion
picked
out
the
largest
lumps
of
sugar
in
the
basin
london
changes
so
many
people
mused
the
persevering
lady
stirring
her
tea
i
noticed
it
before
why
it
is
i
ca
say
but
the
fact
remains
it
seems
to
improve
them
altogether
i
dare
say
that
young
hardy
will
you
understand
that
i
wo
have
the
hardys
mentiond
in
my
house
said
the
captain
looking
up
i
not
interested
in
their
business
and
i
will
not
have
it
discussed
here
as
you
please
john
said
his
sister
drawing
herself
up
it
your
house
and
you
are
master
here
i
sure
i
do
want
to
discuss
them
nothing
was
farther
from
my
thoughts
you
understand
what
your
father
says
kate
perfectly
said
miss
nugent
when
the
desire
to
talk
about
the
hardys
becomes
irresistible
we
must
go
for
a
walk
the
captain
turned
in
his
chair
and
regarded
his
daughter
steadily
she
met
his
gaze
with
calm
affection
i
wish
you
were
a
boy
he
growled
you
the
only
man
in
sunwich
who
wishes
that
said
miss
nugent
complacently
and
i
do
believe
you
mean
it
if
you
come
a
little
closer
i
put
my
head
on
your
shoulder
and
convert
you
kate
said
kingdom
reprovingly
and
talking
about
heads
said
miss
nugent
briskly
reminds
me
that
i
want
a
new
hat
you
need
look
like
that
daughters
always
come
expensive
she
moved
her
chair
a
couple
of
inches
in
his
direction
and
smiled
alluringly
the
captain
shifted
uneasily
prudence
counselled
flight
but
dignity
forbade
it
he
stared
hard
at
kingdom
and
a
smile
of
rare
appreciation
on
that
lady
face
endeavoured
to
fade
slowly
and
naturally
into
another
expression
the
chair
came
nearer
do
be
foolish
said
the
captain
gruffly
the
chair
came
still
nearer
until
at
last
it
touched
his
and
then
miss
nugent
with
a
sigh
of
exaggerated
content
allowed
her
head
to
sink
gracefully
on
his
shoulder
most
comfortable
shoulder
in
sunwich
she
murmured
come
and
try
the
other
aunt
and
perhaps
you
get
a
new
bonnet
illustration
comfortable
