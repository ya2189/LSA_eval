extensive

did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the

this

was

i
admit
it
i
did
know
if
i
was
coming
or
going
but
i
know
that
if
i
stuck
to
the
old
man
i
was
a
comer
even
if
he
was
a
goner
doc
had
this
solemn
human
by
the
throat
when
i
caught
up
with
him
tonight
doc
was
saying
in
his
old
voice
that
was
as
crackled
and
important
as
parchment
tonight
man
will
reach
the
moon
the
golden
moon
and
the
silver
ship
symbols
of
greed
tonight
is
the
night
when
this
is
to
happen
sure
the
man
agreed
severely
prying
a
little
worriedly
at
arthritic
fingers
that
were
clamped
on
his
collar
no
argument
sure
up
we
go
but
leave
me
go
or
so
help
me
i
fetch
you
one
in
the
teeth
i
came
alongside
and
carefully
started
to
lever
the
old
man
loose
one
finger
at
a
time
it
had
to
be
done
this
way
i
had
learned
that
during
all
these
weeks
and
months
his
hands
looked
old
and
crippled
but
i
felt
they
were
the
strongest
in
the
world
if
a
half
dozen
winos
in
seattle
had
helped
me
get
them
loose
doc
and
i
would
have
been
wanted
for
the
murder
of
a
north
american
mountie
it
was
easier
this
night
and
that
made
me
afraid
doc
thin
frame
layered
with
lumpy
fat
was
beginning
to
against
my
side
one
of
his
times
was
coming
on
him
then
at
last
he
was
free
of
the
greasy
collar
of
the
human
i
hope
you
forgive
him
sir
i
said
not
meeting
the
man
eyes
he
my
father
and
very
old
as
you
can
see
i
laughed
inside
at
the
absurd
easy
lie
old
events
seem
recent
to
him
the
human
nodded
adam
apple
jerking
in
the
angry
neon
twilight
jump
you
mean
all
my
have
it
but
lupos
funny
thing
is
like
a
schoolgirl
sharp
you
know
i
say
the
poor
old
guy
looks
sick
want
any
help
i
told
the
human
no
thanks
and
walked
doc
toward
the
flophouse
three
doors
down
i
hoped
we
would
make
it
i
did
know
what
would
happen
if
we
did
doc
was
liable
to
say
something
that
might
nova
sol
for
all
i
knew
martians
approaching
the
corner
were
sensing
at
doc
and
me
they
were
just
cheap
tourists
slumming
down
on
skid
row
i
hated
tourists
and
especially
i
hated
martian
tourists
because
i
especially
hated
martians
they
were
they
were
like
doc
and
me
then
i
realized
what
was
about
to
happen
it
was
foolish
and
awful
and
true
i
was
going
to
have
one
of
mine
at
the
same
time
doc
was
having
his
that
was
bad
it
had
happened
a
few
times
right
after
i
first
found
him
but
now
it
was
worse
for
some
undefinable
reason
i
felt
we
kept
getting
closer
each
of
the
times
i
tried
not
to
think
about
it
and
helped
doc
through
the
flophouse
doors
the
tubercular
clerk
looked
up
from
the
gaudy
comics
sections
of
one
of
those
little
tabloids
that
have
the
funnies
a
week
in
advance
fifteen
cents
a
bed
he
said
mechanically
we
use
one
bed
i
told
him
i
give
you
twenty
cents
i
felt
the
round
hard
quarter
in
my
pocket
sweaty
hand
against
sticky
lining
fifteen
cents
a
bed
he
played
it
back
for
me
doc
was
quivering
against
me
his
legs
boneless
we
can
always
make
it
over
to
the
mission
i
lied
the
clerk
turned
his
upper
lip
as
if
he
were
going
to
spit
awright
since
we
ai
full
up
in
i
placed
the
quarter
on
the
desk
give
me
a
nickel
the
clerk
hand
fell
on
the
coin
and
slid
it
off
into
the
unknown
before
i
could
move
what
with
holding
up
doc
you
got
your
nerve
he
said
at
me
with
a
fine
mist
of
dew
had
a
quarter
all
along
and
yet
you
martian
me
down
to
twenty
cents
he
saw
the
look
on
my
face
i
give
you
a
for
the
two
bits
a
bed
for
twenty
i
knew
i
was
going
to
need
that
nickel
i
reached
across
the
desk
with
my
free
hand
and
hauled
the
scrawny
human
up
against
the
register
hard
i
not
as
strong
in
my
hands
as
doc
but
i
managed
give
me
a
nickel
i
said
what
nickel
his
eyes
were
big
but
they
kept
looking
right
at
me
you
do
have
any
nickel
you
do
have
any
quarter
not
if
i
say
so
want
i
should
call
a
cop
and
tell
him
you
were
flexing
a
muscle
i
let
go
of
him
he
did
scare
me
but
doc
was
beginning
to
mumble
and
that
scare
me
i
had
to
get
him
alone
where
the
room
i
asked
the
room
was
six
feet
in
all
directions
and
the
walls
were
five
feet
high
the
other
foot
was
finished
in
chicken
wire
there
was
a
wino
singing
on
the
left
a
wino
praying
on
the
right
and
the
door
have
any
lock
on
it
at
last
doc
and
i
were
alone
i
laid
doc
out
on
the
cot
and
put
his
forearm
over
his
face
to
shield
it
some
from
the
glare
of
the
light
bulb
i
swept
off
all
the
bedbugs
in
sight
and
stepped
on
them
heavily
then
i
dropped
down
into
the
painted
stool
chair
and
let
my
burning
eyes
rest
on
the
obscene
wall
drawings
just
to
focus
them
i
was
so
dirty
i
could
feel
the
grime
grinding
together
all
over
me
my
shaggy
scalp
still
smarted
from
the
alcohol
i
had
stolen
from
a
gas
tank
to
get
rid
of
doc
and
my
cooties
lucky
that
i
never
needed
to
shave
and
that
my
face
was
so
dirty
no
one
would
even
notice
that
i
did
need
to
the
cramp
hit
me
and
i
folded
out
of
the
chair
onto
the
littered
uncovered
floor
it
stopped
hurting
but
i
knew
it
would
begin
if
i
moved
i
stared
at
a
jagged
nude
curled
against
a
lump
of
dust
and
lint
giving
it
an
unreal
distortion
doc
began
to
mumble
louder
i
knew
i
had
to
move
i
waited
just
a
moment
savoring
the
painless
peace
then
finally
i
moved
i
was
bent
double
but
i
got
from
the
floor
to
the
chair
and
found
my
notebook
and
in
my
hands
i
found
i
could
focus
both
my
mind
and
my
eyes
through
the
electric
flashes
of
agony
so
i
concentrated
on
doc
voice
and
trusted
my
hands
would
follow
their
habit
pattern
and
construct
the
symbols
for
his
words
they
were
suddenly
distinguishable
six
seven
his
voice
rose
to
a
meaningless
wail
that
stretched
into
the
pen
slid
across
the
scribbled
face
of
the
notebook
and
both
dropped
from
my
numb
hands
but
i
knew
somehow
inside
me
that
these
words
were
what
i
had
been
waiting
for
they
told
everything
i
needed
to
know
to
become
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
solar
federation
that
was
just
an
addict
dream
i
knew
who
doc
was
when
i
got
to
thinking
it
was
just
a
dream
and
that
i
was
dragging
this
old
man
around
north
america
for
nothing
i
remembered
who
he
was
i
remembered
that
he
was
somebody
very
important
whose
name
and
work
i
had
once
known
even
if
now
i
knew
him
only
as
doc
pain
was
a
pendulum
within
me
swinging
from
low
throbbing
bass
to
high
screaming
tenor
i
had
to
get
out
and
get
some
but
i
did
have
a
nickel
still
i
had
to
get
some
i
crawled
to
the
door
and
raised
myself
by
the
knob
slick
with
greasy
dirt
the
door
opened
and
shut
there
was
no
lock
i
should
leave
doc
alone
but
i
had
to
he
was
starting
to
cry
he
did
always
do
that
i
listened
to
him
for
a
moment
then
tested
and
tasted
the
craving
that
crawled
through
my
veins
i
got
back
inside
somehow
doc
was
twisting
on
the
cot
tears
washing
white
streaks
across
his
face
i
shoved
doc
face
up
against
my
chest
i
held
onto
him
and
let
him
bellow
i
soothed
the
lanks
of
soiled
white
hair
back
over
his
lumpy
skull
he
shut
up
at
last
and
i
laid
him
down
again
and
put
his
arm
back
across
his
face
you
ca
turn
the
light
off
and
on
in
places
like
that
the
old
wiring
will
blow
the
bulb
half
the
time
i
do
remember
how
i
got
out
onto
the
street
she
was
pink
and
clean
and
her
platinum
hair
was
pulled
straight
back
drawing
her
tighter
straightening
her
wide
appealing
mouth
drawing
her
lean
athletic
feminine
body
erect
she
was
wearing
a
dress
that
covered
all
of
her
breasts
and
hips
and
the
upper
half
of
her
legs
the
most
wonderful
thing
about
her
was
her
perfume
then
i
realized
it
was
perfume
only
the
scent
of
soap
finally
i
knew
it
was
that
it
was
just
healthy
skin
i
went
to
her
at
the
bus
stop
forcing
my
legs
not
to
stagger
nobody
would
help
a
drunk
i
do
know
why
but
nobody
will
help
you
if
they
think
you
are
blotto
could
you
help
a
man
who
not
had
work
i
kept
my
eyes
down
i
could
look
a
human
in
the
eye
and
ask
for
help
just
a
dime
for
a
cup
of
coffee
i
knew
where
i
could
get
it
for
three
cents
maybe
two
and
a
half
i
felt
her
looking
at
me
she
spoke
in
an
educated
voice
one
she
used
perhaps
as
a
teacher
or
supervising
telephone
operator
do
you
want
it
for
coffee
or
to
apply
or
a
glass
or
hypo
of
something
else
i
cringed
and
whined
she
would
expect
it
of
me
i
suddenly
realized
that
anybody
as
clean
as
she
was
had
to
be
a
tourist
here
i
hate
tourists
just
coffee
she
was
younger
than
i
was
so
i
did
have
to
call
her
that
a
little
more
for
food
if
you
could
spare
it
i
had
eaten
in
a
day
and
a
half
but
i
did
care
much
i
buy
you
a
dinner
she
said
carefully
provided
i
can
go
with
you
and
see
for
myself
that
you
actually
eat
it
i
felt
my
face
flushing
red
you
would
want
to
be
seen
with
a
bum
like
me
i
be
seen
with
you
if
you
really
want
to
eat
it
was
certainly
unfair
and
probably
immoral
but
i
had
no
choice
whatever
okay
i
said
tasting
bitterness
over
the
craving
the
coffee
was
in
a
thick
white
cup
before
me
on
the
counter
it
was
pale
grayish
brown
and
steaming
faintly
i
picked
it
up
in
both
hands
to
feel
its
warmth
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
could
see
the
woman
sitting
on
the
stool
beside
me
she
had
no
right
to
intrude
this
moment
should
be
mine
but
there
she
sat
marring
it
for
me
a
contemptible
i
gulped
down
the
thick
dark
liquid
brutally
it
was
all
i
could
do
the
cramp
flowed
out
of
my
diaphragm
i
took
another
swallow
and
was
able
to
think
straight
again
a
third
swallow
and
i
felt
good
not
abnormally
stimulated
but
strong
alert
poised
on
the
brink
of
exhilaration
that
was
what
coffee
did
for
me
i
was
a
caffeine
addict
humans
sometimes
have
the
addiction
to
a
slight
extent
but
i
knew
that
as
a
centurian
i
had
it
infinitely
worse
caffeine
affected
my
metabolism
like
a
pure
alkaloid
the
immediate
effects
were
the
same
but
the
ran
as
deep
i
finished
the
cup
i
did
order
another
because
i
was
a
pure
sensualist
i
just
needed
release
sometimes
when
i
did
have
the
price
of
a
cup
i
would
look
around
in
alleys
and
find
cola
bottles
with
a
few
drops
left
in
them
they
have
a
little
caffeine
in
them
not
enough
never
enough
but
better
than
nothing
now
what
do
you
want
to
eat
the
woman
asked
i
did
look
at
her
she
did
know
she
thought
i
was
a
human
an
human
i
was
a
of
course
not
an
like
a
martian
earthmen
ran
the
whole
solar
federation
but
i
was
just
as
good
as
an
earthman
with
my
suntan
and
short
mane
i
could
pass
could
i
that
proved
it
did
it
hamburger
i
said
well
done
i
knew
that
would
probably
be
all
they
had
fit
to
eat
at
a
place
like
this
it
might
be
horse
meat
but
then
i
did
have
the
local
prejudices
i
did
look
at
the
woman
i
could
but
i
kept
remembering
how
clean
she
looked
and
i
was
aware
of
how
clean
she
smelled
i
was
so
dirty
so
very
dirty
that
i
could
never
get
clean
if
i
bathed
every
hour
for
the
rest
of
my
life
the
hamburger
was
engulfed
by
five
broken
fingernails
and
raised
to
two
rows
of
yellow
ivory
i
surrounded
it
like
an
ameba
almost
in
a
single
movement
of
my
jaws
several
other
hamburgers
followed
the
first
i
lost
count
i
drank
a
glass
of
milk
i
did
want
to
black
out
on
coffee
with
doc
waiting
for
me
could
i
have
a
few
to
take
with
me
miss
i
pleaded
she
smiled
i
caught
that
out
of
the
edge
of
my
vision
but
mostly
i
just
felt
it
that
the
first
time
you
called
me
anything
but
she
said
i
not
an
schoolteacher
you
know
that
probably
meant
she
was
a
schoolteacher
though
no
miss
i
said
it
miss
casey
vivian
casey
she
corrected
she
was
a
schoolteacher
all
right
no
other
girl
would
introduce
herself
as
miss
last
name
then
there
was
something
in
her
voice
what
your
name
she
said
to
me
i
choked
a
little
on
a
bite
of
stale
bun
i
a
name
everybody
has
a
name
and
i
knew
if
i
went
off
somewhere
quiet
and
thought
about
it
mine
would
come
to
me
meanwhile
i
would
tell
the
girl
that
my
name
was
kevin
abruptly
i
realized
that
that
my
name
kevin
i
told
her
john
kevin
mister
kevin
she
said
her
words
dancing
with
bright
absurdity
like
waterhose
mist
on
a
summer
afternoon
i
wonder
if
you
could
help
happy
to
miss
i
mumbled
she
pushed
a
white
rectangle
in
front
of
me
on
the
painted
maroon
bar
what
do
you
think
of
this
i
looked
at
the
piece
of
paper
it
was
a
coupon
from
a
magazine
dear
acolyte
please
send
me
free
of
obligation
in
sealed
wrapper
the
scarlet
book
revealing
to
me
how
i
may
gain
secret
mastery
of
the
universe
name
address
the
world
disoriented
itself
and
i
was
on
the
floor
of
the
somber
diner
and
miss
vivian
casey
was
out
of
sight
and
scent
there
was
a
five
dollar
bill
tight
in
my
fist
the
counterman
was
trying
to
pull
it
out
i
looked
up
at
his
stubbled
face
i
had
half
a
dozen
hamburgers
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
glass
of
milk
i
want
four
more
to
go
and
a
pint
of
coffee
by
your
prices
that
will
be
one
if
the
lady
did
pay
you
she
did
he
stammered
why
do
you
think
i
was
trying
to
get
that
bill
out
of
your
hand
i
did
say
anything
just
got
up
off
the
floor
after
the
counterman
put
down
my
change
i
spread
out
the
five
dollar
bill
on
the
vacant
bar
smoothing
it
i
scooped
up
my
change
and
walked
out
the
door
there
was
no
one
on
the
sidewalk
only
in
the
doorways
first
i
opened
the
door
on
an
amber
world
then
an
azure
one
neon
light
was
coming
from
the
chickenwire
border
of
the
room
from
a
window
somewhere
beyond
the
wino
on
one
side
of
the
room
was
singing
and
the
one
on
the
other
side
was
praying
same
as
before
only
they
had
changed
around
prayer
came
from
the
left
song
from
the
right
doc
sat
on
the
floor
in
the
and
he
had
made
a
my
heart
hammered
at
my
lungs
i
this
last
time
had
been
different
whatever
it
was
was
getting
closer
this
was
the
first
time
doc
had
ever
made
anything
it
did
look
like
much
but
it
was
a
start
he
had
broken
the
light
bulb
and
used
the
filament
and
screw
bottom
his
strong
hands
had
unraveled
some
of
the
bed
springs
metal
webbing
and
fashioned
them
to
his
needs
my
pen
had
dissolved
under
his
touch
all
of
them
useless
parts
were
made
into
a
meaningful
whole
i
knew
the
thing
had
meaning
but
when
i
tried
to
follow
its
design
i
became
lost
i
put
the
paper
container
of
warm
coffee
and
the
greasy
bag
of
hamburgers
on
the
wooden
chair
hoping
the
odor
would
bring
any
hungry
rats
out
of
the
walls
i
knelt
beside
doc
an
order
my
boy
an
order
he
whispered
i
did
know
what
he
meant
was
he
suddenly
trying
to
give
me
orders
he
held
something
out
to
me
it
was
my
notebook
he
had
used
my
pen
before
dismantling
it
to
write
something
i
tilted
the
notebook
against
the
neon
light
now
red
wine
now
fresh
grape
i
read
it
concentrate
doc
said
hoarsely
concentrate
i
wondered
what
the
words
meant
wondering
takes
a
kind
of
concentration
the
words
first
edition
were
what
i
was
thinking
about
most
the
man
in
the
ornate
armchair
was
saying
the
bullet
struck
me
as
i
was
pulling
on
my
boot
i
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
of
a
victorian
living
room
i
quite
familiar
with
earth
history
and
i
recognized
the
period
immediately
then
i
realized
what
i
had
been
trying
to
get
from
doc
all
these
months
time
travel
a
thin
sickly
man
was
sprawled
in
the
other
chair
in
a
rumpled
dressing
gown
my
eyes
held
to
his
face
his
pinpoint
pupils
and
whitened
nose
he
was
a
condemned
snowbird
if
there
was
anything
i
hated
or
held
in
more
contempt
than
tourists
or
martians
it
was
a
snowbird
my
clients
have
occasioned
singular
methods
of
entry
into
these
rooms
the
thin
man
remarked
but
never
before
have
they
used
instantaneous
materialization
the
heavier
man
was
half
choking
half
laughing
i
say
i
say
i
would
like
to
see
you
explain
this
my
dear
fellow
i
have
no
data
the
thin
man
answered
coolly
in
such
instance
one
begins
to
twist
theories
into
fact
or
facts
into
theories
i
must
ask
this
unemployed
former
professional
man
who
has
gone
through
a
serious
illness
and
is
suffering
a
more
serious
addiction
to
tell
me
the
place
and
from
which
he
comes
the
surprise
stung
how
did
you
know
i
asked
he
gestured
with
a
pale
hand
to
maintain
a
logical
approach
i
must
reject
the
supernatural
your
arrival
unless
hallucinatory
and
despite
my
voluntary
use
of
one
drug
and
my
involuntary
experiences
recently
with
another
i
must
accept
the
evidence
of
my
senses
or
retire
from
my
profession
your
arrival
was
then
i
might
say
of
a
science
not
of
my
or
the
good
doctor
time
clearly
time
travel
is
a
familiar
folk
legend
and
i
have
been
reading
an
article
by
the
entertaining
wells
perhaps
he
will
expand
it
into
one
of
his
novels
of
scientific
romance
i
knew
who
these
two
men
were
with
a
tormenting
doubt
but
the
other
your
hands
though
unclean
have
never
seen
physical
labor
your
cranial
construction
is
of
a
superior
type
or
even
if
you
reject
my
theories
concentration
does
set
the
facial
features
i
judge
you
have
suffered
an
illness
because
of
the
inhibition
of
your
beard
growth
your
for
rum
or
opium
perhaps
is
you
are
at
too
resilient
an
age
to
be
so
sunk
by
even
an
amour
why
else
then
would
you
let
yourself
fall
into
such
an
underfed
and
unsanitary
state
he
was
so
smug
and
so
sure
this
snowbird
i
hated
him
because
i
could
trust
to
my
own
senses
as
he
did
you
do
exist
i
said
slowly
painfully
you
are
fictional
creations
the
doctor
flushed
darkly
you
give
my
literary
agent
too
much
credit
for
the
addition
of
professional
polish
to
my
works
the
other
man
was
filling
a
large
curved
pipe
from
something
that
looked
vaguely
like
an
interesting
perhaps
if
our
visitor
would
tell
us
something
of
his
age
with
special
reference
to
the
theory
and
practice
of
temporal
transference
doctor
we
would
be
better
equipped
to
judge
whether
we
exist
there
was
no
theory
or
practice
of
time
travel
i
told
them
all
i
had
ever
heard
theorized
from
hindu
yoga
through
perception
to
relativity
and
the
positron
and
negatron
interesting
he
breathed
out
suffocating
black
clouds
of
smoke
presume
that
the
people
of
your
time
by
their
perception
have
altered
the
past
to
make
it
as
they
suppose
it
to
be
the
great
historical
figures
are
made
the
larger
than
that
we
know
them
the
great
literary
creations
assume
reality
i
thought
of
cleopatra
and
helen
of
troy
and
wondered
if
they
would
be
the
goddesses
of
love
that
people
imagined
or
the
scrawny
redhead
and
fading
old
woman
of
scholarship
then
i
noticed
the
detective
hand
that
had
been
resting
idly
on
a
round
brass
weight
of
unknown
sort
to
me
his
tapered
fingertips
had
indented
the
metal
his
bright
eyes
followed
mine
and
he
smiled
faintly
withdrawal
symptoms
the
admiration
and
affection
for
this
man
that
had
been
slowly
building
up
behind
my
hatred
unbrinked
i
remembered
now
that
he
had
stopped
he
was
not
a
snowbird
after
a
time
i
asked
the
doctor
a
question
why
yes
i
flattered
this
is
the
first
manuscript
considering
my
professional
handwriting
i
recopied
it
more
laboriously
accepting
the
sheaf
of
papers
and
not
looking
back
at
these
two
great
and
good
men
i
concentrated
on
my
own
time
and
doc
nothing
happened
my
heart
raced
but
i
saw
something
dancing
before
me
like
a
dust
mote
in
sunlight
and
stepped
toward
it
into
the
effective
range
of
miss
casey
tiny
gun
she
inclined
the
lethal
silver
toy
let
me
see
those
papers
kevin
i
handed
her
the
doctor
manuscript
her
breath
escaped
slowly
and
loudly
it
all
right
it
all
right
it
exists
it
real
not
even
one
of
the
unwritten
ones
i
read
this
myself
doc
was
lying
on
the
cot
half
his
face
twisted
into
horror
do
move
kevin
she
said
i
have
to
shoot
you
maybe
not
to
kill
but
painfully
i
watched
her
face
flash
blue
red
blue
and
knew
she
meant
it
but
i
had
known
too
much
in
too
short
a
time
i
had
to
help
doc
but
there
was
something
else
i
just
want
a
drink
of
coffee
from
that
container
on
the
chair
i
told
her
she
shook
her
head
i
do
know
what
you
think
it
does
to
you
it
was
getting
hard
for
me
to
think
who
are
you
she
showed
me
a
card
from
her
wrist
purse
vivian
casey
constable
north
american
mounted
police
i
had
to
help
doc
i
had
to
have
some
coffee
what
do
you
want
listen
kevin
listen
carefully
to
what
i
am
saying
doc
found
a
method
of
time
travel
it
was
almost
a
purely
mathematical
topographical
way
divorced
from
modern
physical
sciences
he
kept
it
secret
and
he
wanted
to
make
money
with
it
he
was
an
idealist
he
had
his
crusades
how
can
you
make
money
with
time
travel
i
did
know
whether
she
was
asking
me
but
i
did
know
all
i
knew
was
that
i
had
to
help
doc
and
get
some
coffee
it
takes
money
money
doc
did
have
to
make
money
miss
casey
said
even
if
you
know
what
horse
will
come
in
and
what
stock
will
prosper
besides
and
the
stock
market
were
a
part
of
doc
character
he
was
a
scholar
why
did
she
keep
using
the
past
tense
in
reference
to
doc
it
scared
me
he
was
lying
so
still
with
the
left
side
of
his
face
so
twisted
i
needed
some
coffee
he
became
a
book
finder
he
got
rare
editions
of
books
and
magazines
for
his
clients
in
absolutely
mint
condition
that
was
all
right
until
he
started
obtaining
books
that
not
i
did
know
what
all
that
was
supposed
to
mean
i
got
to
the
chair
snatched
up
the
coffee
container
tore
it
open
and
gulped
down
the
soothing
liquid
i
turned
toward
her
and
threw
the
rest
of
the
coffee
into
her
face
the
coffee
splashed
out
over
her
platinum
hair
and
dress
that
looked
white
when
the
neon
was
azure
purple
when
it
was
amber
the
coffee
stained
and
soiled
and
ruined
and
i
was
fiercely
glad
unreasonably
happy
i
tore
the
gun
away
from
her
by
the
short
barrel
not
letting
my
filthy
hands
touch
her
scrubbed
pink
ones
i
pointed
the
gun
generally
at
her
and
backed
around
the
on
the
floor
to
the
cot
doc
had
a
pulse
but
it
was
irregular
i
checked
for
a
fever
and
there
was
one
after
that
i
did
know
what
to
do
i
looked
up
finally
and
saw
a
martian
in
or
about
the
doorway
call
me
andre
the
martian
said
a
common
name
but
foreign
it
should
serve
as
a
point
of
reference
i
had
always
wondered
how
a
thing
like
a
martian
could
talk
sometimes
i
wondered
if
they
really
could
you
wo
need
the
gun
andre
said
conversationally
i
keep
it
thanks
what
do
want
i
begin
as
miss
casey
did
by
telling
you
things
hundreds
of
people
disappeared
from
north
america
a
few
months
ago
they
always
do
i
told
him
they
ceased
to
exist
as
human
beings
shortly
after
they
received
a
book
from
doc
the
martian
said
something
seemed
to
strike
me
in
the
back
of
the
neck
i
staggered
but
managed
to
hold
onto
the
gun
and
stand
up
use
one
of
those
sneaky
martian
weapons
again
i
warned
him
and
i
kill
the
girl
martians
were
supposed
to
be
against
the
destruction
of
any
i
had
read
someplace
i
doubted
it
but
it
was
worth
a
try
kevin
andre
said
why
do
you
take
a
bath
the
martian
weapon
staggered
me
again
i
tried
to
say
something
i
tried
to
explain
that
i
was
so
dirty
that
i
could
never
get
clean
no
matter
how
often
i
bathed
no
words
formed
but
kevin
andre
said
you
are
dirty
the
blow
shook
the
gun
from
my
fingers
it
almost
fell
into
the
on
the
floor
but
at
the
last
moment
seemed
to
change
direction
and
miss
it
i
knew
something
i
do
wash
because
i
drink
coffee
it
all
right
to
drink
coffee
is
it
he
asked
of
course
i
said
and
added
absurdly
that
why
i
do
you
mean
andre
said
slowly
ploddingly
that
if
you
bathed
you
would
be
admitting
that
drinking
coffee
was
in
the
same
class
as
any
other
solitary
vice
that
makes
people
wash
frequently
i
was
knocked
to
my
knees
kevin
the
martian
said
drinking
coffee
represents
a
major
vice
only
in
centurian
humanoids
not
human
beings
are
you
nothing
came
out
of
my
gabbling
mouth
is
doc
full
name
i
almost
fell
in
but
at
the
last
instant
i
caught
myself
and
said
doctor
kevin
senior
from
the
bed
doc
said
a
word
son
then
he
disappeared
i
looked
at
that
which
he
had
made
i
wondered
where
he
had
gone
in
search
of
what
he
did
use
that
andre
said
so
i
was
an
earthman
doc
son
so
my
addiction
to
coffee
was
all
in
my
mind
that
did
change
anything
they
say
sex
is
all
in
your
mind
i
did
want
to
be
cured
i
would
be
doc
was
gone
that
was
all
i
had
now
that
and
the
he
left
the
rest
is
simple
andre
said
doc
bought
up
all
the
stock
in
a
certain
ancient
metaphysical
order
and
started
supplying
members
with
certain
books
can
you
imagine
the
effect
of
the
of
or
the
of
or
the
cryptical
books
of
or
the
itself
on
human
beings
but
they
do
exist
i
said
wearily
exactly
kevin
exactly
they
have
never
existed
any
more
than
your
victorian
detective
friend
but
the
unconscious
racial
mind
has
reached
back
into
time
and
created
them
and
that
unconscious
mind
deeper
than
psychology
terms
the
subconscious
has
always
known
about
the
powers
of
esp
telepathy
telekinesis
precognition
through
these
books
the
human
race
can
tell
itself
how
to
achieve
a
state
of
pure
logic
without
food
without
sex
without
conflict
just
as
doc
has
achieved
such
a
state
a
little
late
true
he
had
a
powerful
guilt
complex
even
stronger
than
your
withdrawal
over
releasing
this
blessing
on
the
inhabited
universe
but
reason
finally
prevailed
he
had
reached
a
state
of
pure
thought
the
north
american
government
to
have
this
secret
kevin
the
girl
said
you
ca
let
it
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
martians
andre
did
not
deny
that
he
wanted
it
to
fall
into
his
hands
i
knew
i
could
not
let
doc
dad
time
travel
fall
into
anyone
hands
i
remembered
that
all
the
copies
of
the
books
had
disappeared
with
their
readers
now
there
must
not
be
any
more
i
knew
miss
casey
did
her
duty
and
tried
to
stop
me
with
a
judo
hold
but
i
do
think
her
heart
was
in
it
because
i
reversed
and
broke
it
i
kicked
the
to
pieces
and
stomped
on
the
pieces
maybe
you
ca
stop
the
progress
of
science
but
i
knew
it
might
be
millenniums
before
doc
genes
and
creative
environment
were
recreated
and
time
travel
was
rediscovered
maybe
we
would
be
ready
for
it
then
i
knew
we
were
now
miss
casey
leaned
against
my
dirty
chest
and
cried
into
it
i
mind
her
touching
me
i
glad
she
said
andre
flowed
out
of
the
doorway
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
would
never
know
i
supposed
i
had
destroyed
because
i
want
the
human
race
to
become
a
thing
of
pure
reason
without
purpose
direction
or
love
but
i
would
never
know
for
sure
i
thought
i
could
kick
the
habit
perhaps
with
miss
casey
help
but
i
was
really
confident
maybe
i
had
destroyed
the
time
machine
because
a
world
without
material
needs
would
not
grow
and
roast
coffee
