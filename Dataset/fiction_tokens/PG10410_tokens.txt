chapter
i
lisa
knight
and
lisa
sister
it
had
come
at
last
the
moment
i
had
been
thinking
about
for
days
i
was
going
to
have
him
all
to
myself
the
only
person
in
the
world
i
ever
loved
he
had
asked
me
to
sit
out
two
dances
and
that
made
me
think
he
really
must
want
to
be
with
me
not
just
because
i
the
pretty
sister
but
because
i
myself
lisa
drummond
being
what
i
am
queer
and
plain
i
ca
bear
to
think
that
men
like
girls
for
their
beauty
yet
i
ca
help
liking
men
better
if
they
are
handsome
i
do
know
if
ivor
dundas
is
the
handsomest
man
i
ever
saw
but
he
seems
so
to
me
i
do
know
if
he
is
very
good
or
really
very
wonderful
although
he
clever
and
ambitious
enough
but
he
has
a
way
that
makes
women
fond
of
him
and
men
admire
him
too
he
looks
straight
into
your
eyes
when
he
talks
to
you
as
if
he
cared
more
for
you
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
and
if
i
were
an
artist
painting
a
picture
of
a
dark
young
knight
starting
off
for
the
crusades
i
should
ask
ivor
dundas
to
stand
as
my
model
perhaps
his
expression
would
be
exactly
right
for
the
pious
young
crusader
for
it
is
at
all
saintly
really
still
i
have
seen
just
that
rapt
sort
of
look
on
his
face
it
was
generally
when
he
was
talking
to
di
but
i
would
let
myself
believe
that
it
meant
anything
in
particular
he
has
the
reputation
of
having
made
lots
of
women
fall
in
love
with
him
this
was
one
of
the
first
things
i
heard
when
di
and
i
came
over
from
america
to
visit
lord
and
lady
mountstuart
and
of
course
there
was
the
story
about
him
and
maxine
de
renzie
everyone
was
talking
of
it
when
we
first
arrived
in
london
my
heart
beat
very
fast
as
i
guided
him
into
the
room
which
lady
mountstuart
has
given
di
and
me
for
our
special
den
it
is
separated
by
another
larger
room
from
the
ballroom
but
both
doors
were
open
and
we
could
see
people
dancing
i
told
him
he
might
sit
by
me
on
the
sofa
under
di
book
shelves
because
we
could
talk
better
there
usually
i
do
like
being
in
front
of
a
mirror
because
well
because
i
only
the
pretty
girl
sister
but
i
did
mind
my
cheeks
were
red
and
my
eyes
bright
sitting
down
you
might
almost
take
me
for
a
tall
girl
and
the
way
my
gown
was
made
did
show
that
one
shoulder
is
a
little
higher
than
the
other
di
designed
the
dress
i
thought
if
i
was
pretty
i
did
look
interesting
and
original
i
looked
as
if
i
could
of
things
and
as
if
i
could
feel
and
i
was
feeling
i
was
wondering
why
he
had
been
so
good
to
me
lately
unless
he
cared
of
course
it
might
be
for
di
sake
but
i
am
not
so
that
no
man
could
ever
be
fascinated
by
me
they
say
pity
is
akin
to
love
perhaps
he
had
begun
by
pitying
me
because
di
has
everything
and
i
nothing
and
then
afterwards
he
had
found
out
that
i
was
intelligent
and
sympathetic
he
sat
by
me
and
did
speak
at
first
just
then
di
passed
the
open
door
of
the
ballroom
dancing
with
lord
robert
west
the
duke
of
glasgow
brother
thank
you
so
much
for
the
book
i
said
he
had
sent
me
a
book
that
morning
one
he
heard
me
say
i
wanted
he
did
seem
to
hear
and
then
he
turned
suddenly
with
one
of
his
nice
smiles
i
always
think
he
has
the
nicest
smile
in
the
world
and
certainly
he
has
the
nicest
voice
his
eyes
looked
very
kind
and
a
little
sad
i
willed
him
hard
to
love
me
it
made
me
happy
to
get
it
i
went
on
it
made
me
happy
to
send
it
he
said
does
it
please
you
to
do
things
for
me
i
asked
why
of
course
you
do
like
poor
little
me
a
tiny
bit
then
i
could
help
adding
even
though
i
different
from
other
girls
perhaps
more
for
that
reason
he
said
with
his
voice
as
kind
as
his
eyes
oh
what
shall
i
do
if
you
go
away
i
burst
out
partly
because
i
really
meant
it
and
partly
because
i
hoped
it
might
lead
him
on
to
say
what
i
wanted
so
much
to
hear
suppose
you
get
that
consulship
at
algiers
i
hope
i
may
he
said
quickly
a
consulship
is
a
very
great
thing
but
it
a
beginning
i
want
it
badly
i
wish
i
had
some
influence
with
the
foreign
secretary
said
i
not
telling
him
that
the
man
actually
dislikes
me
and
looks
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
toad
of
course
he
lord
mountstuart
cousin
and
as
well
and
that
makes
him
seem
quite
in
the
family
does
it
but
it
is
as
if
i
were
really
related
to
lady
mountstuart
i
was
never
sorry
before
that
di
and
i
are
only
no
not
a
bit
sorry
though
her
mother
had
all
the
money
and
brought
it
to
my
poor
father
but
now
i
wish
i
were
lady
mountstuart
niece
and
that
i
had
some
of
the
coaxing
ways
di
can
put
on
when
she
wants
to
get
something
out
of
people
i
make
the
foreign
secretary
give
you
exactly
what
you
wanted
even
if
it
took
you
far
far
from
me
with
that
he
looked
at
me
suddenly
and
his
face
grew
slowly
red
under
the
brown
you
are
a
very
kind
imp
he
said
imp
is
the
name
he
invented
for
me
i
loved
to
hear
him
call
me
by
it
kind
i
echoed
one
is
kind
when
one
likes
people
i
saw
by
his
eyes
then
that
he
knew
but
i
did
care
if
only
i
could
make
him
say
the
words
i
longed
to
hear
even
because
he
pitied
me
because
he
had
found
out
how
i
loved
him
and
because
he
had
really
too
much
of
the
in
him
to
break
my
heart
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
take
him
at
his
word
quickly
if
he
gave
me
the
chance
and
i
would
tell
di
that
he
was
dreadfully
in
love
with
me
that
would
make
her
writhe
i
kept
my
eyes
on
him
and
i
let
them
tell
him
everything
he
saw
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
but
he
did
not
say
the
words
i
hoped
for
a
moment
or
two
he
was
silent
and
then
gazing
away
towards
the
door
of
the
ballroom
he
spoke
very
gently
as
if
i
had
been
a
child
though
i
am
older
than
di
by
three
or
four
years
thank
you
imp
for
letting
me
see
that
you
are
such
a
staunch
little
friend
said
he
now
that
i
know
you
really
do
take
an
interest
in
my
affairs
i
think
i
may
tell
you
why
i
want
so
much
to
go
to
algiers
though
very
likely
you
guessed
already
you
are
such
an
girl
and
besides
i
have
tried
very
hard
to
hide
my
feelings
not
as
hard
as
i
ought
perhaps
when
i
realise
how
little
i
have
to
offer
to
your
sister
now
you
understand
all
do
you
even
if
you
did
before
i
love
her
and
if
i
go
to
algiers
do
say
any
more
i
managed
to
cut
him
short
i
ca
bear
i
mean
i
understand
i
did
guess
before
it
was
true
i
had
guessed
but
i
would
let
myself
believe
i
hoped
against
hope
he
was
so
much
kinder
to
me
than
any
other
man
ever
took
the
trouble
to
be
in
all
my
wretched
embittered
years
of
life
di
might
have
told
me
i
went
gasping
on
rather
than
let
there
be
a
long
silence
between
us
just
then
i
had
enough
pride
not
to
want
him
to
see
me
cry
though
if
it
could
have
made
any
difference
i
would
have
grovelled
at
his
feet
and
wet
them
with
my
tears
but
she
never
does
tell
me
anything
about
herself
she
so
unselfish
and
so
fond
of
you
that
probably
she
likes
better
to
talk
about
you
instead
he
defended
her
and
then
i
felt
that
i
could
hate
him
as
much
as
i
always
hated
di
deep
down
in
my
heart
at
that
minute
i
should
have
liked
to
kill
her
and
watch
his
face
when
he
found
her
lying
dead
out
of
his
reach
for
ever
besides
he
hurried
on
i
never
asked
her
yet
if
she
would
marry
me
because
my
prospects
were
very
brilliant
she
knows
of
course
that
i
love
her
and
if
you
get
the
consulship
you
put
the
important
question
i
cut
him
short
trying
to
be
flippant
yes
but
i
told
you
tonight
because
i
because
you
were
so
kind
i
felt
i
should
like
to
have
you
know
kind
yes
i
had
been
too
kind
but
if
by
putting
out
my
foot
i
could
have
crushed
every
hope
of
his
for
the
future
every
hope
that
is
in
which
my
stepsister
diana
forrest
had
any
part
i
would
have
done
it
just
as
i
trample
on
ants
in
the
country
sometimes
for
the
pleasure
of
feeling
that
i
even
i
have
power
of
life
and
death
i
swallowed
hard
to
keep
the
sobs
back
i
never
very
strong
or
well
but
now
i
felt
broken
ready
to
die
i
was
glad
when
i
heard
the
music
stop
in
the
ballroom
there
i
said
the
two
dances
you
asked
me
to
sit
out
with
you
are
over
i
sure
you
engaged
for
the
next
yes
imp
i
am
to
di
no
i
have
number
with
her
thirteen
unlucky
number
any
number
is
lucky
that
gives
me
a
chance
with
her
the
next
one
coming
now
is
with
george
allendale
oh
yes
the
actor
manager
wife
she
goes
everywhere
and
lord
mountstuart
likes
theatrical
celebrities
this
house
ought
to
be
very
serious
and
political
but
we
have
every
sort
of
creature
provided
an
amusing
or
successful
or
one
by
the
way
used
maxine
de
renzie
to
come
here
when
she
was
acting
in
london
at
george
allendale
theatre
that
was
before
di
and
i
arrived
on
the
scene
you
remember
i
remember
oh
yes
she
came
here
it
was
in
this
house
i
met
her
first
off
the
stage
i
believe
what
a
sweet
memory
was
george
awfully
jealous
of
her
husband
when
he
had
such
a
fascinating
beauty
for
his
leading
lady
i
never
heard
that
she
was
you
need
look
cross
with
me
i
not
saying
anything
against
your
gorgeous
maxine
of
course
not
nobody
could
but
you
must
call
miss
de
renzie
maxine
please
imp
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
you
see
i
heard
other
people
call
her
that
in
joke
and
you
dedicated
your
book
about
lhassa
that
made
you
such
a
famous
person
to
her
did
you
no
what
made
you
think
that
he
was
really
annoyed
now
and
i
was
pleased
if
anything
could
please
me
in
my
despair
why
everybody
thinks
it
it
was
dedicated
to
as
if
the
name
were
a
secret
so
is
very
stupid
then
is
an
old
lady
my
who
helped
me
with
money
for
my
expedition
to
lhassa
otherwise
i
could
have
gone
and
she
is
of
the
kind
that
likes
to
see
her
name
in
print
now
where
shall
i
take
you
imp
because
i
must
go
and
look
for
mrs
allendale
i
stay
where
i
am
thank
you
i
said
and
watch
you
dance
from
far
off
that
my
part
in
life
you
know
watching
other
people
dance
from
far
off
when
he
was
gone
i
leaned
back
among
the
cushions
and
i
was
sure
that
one
of
my
heart
attacks
would
not
come
on
i
felt
horribly
alone
and
deserted
and
though
i
hate
di
and
always
have
hated
her
ever
since
the
tiny
child
and
her
mother
a
beautiful
rich
young
californian
widow
came
into
my
father
house
in
new
york
she
does
know
how
to
manage
me
better
than
anyone
else
when
i
am
in
such
moods
i
could
have
screamed
for
her
as
i
sat
there
helplessly
looking
through
the
open
doors
and
then
at
last
i
saw
her
as
if
my
wish
had
been
a
call
which
had
reached
her
ears
over
the
music
in
the
ballroom
she
had
stopped
dancing
and
with
her
partner
lord
robert
again
entered
the
room
which
lay
between
our
den
and
the
ballroom
probably
they
would
have
gone
on
to
the
conservatory
which
can
be
reached
in
that
way
but
i
cried
her
name
as
loudly
as
i
could
and
she
heard
only
a
moment
she
paused
long
enough
to
send
lord
robert
away
and
then
she
came
straight
to
me
he
must
have
been
furious
but
i
did
care
for
that
i
had
been
wanting
her
badly
but
when
i
saw
her
so
bright
and
beautiful
looking
as
if
she
were
the
joy
of
life
made
incarnate
i
should
have
liked
to
strike
her
hard
first
on
one
cheek
and
then
the
other
deepening
the
rose
to
crimson
and
leaving
an
ugly
red
mark
for
each
finger
have
you
a
headache
dear
she
asked
in
that
velvet
voice
she
keeps
for
me
as
if
i
were
a
thing
only
fit
for
pity
and
protection
it
my
heart
said
i
it
feels
like
a
clock
running
down
oh
i
wish
i
could
die
and
end
it
all
what
the
good
of
me
to
myself
or
anyone
do
talk
like
that
my
poor
one
she
said
shall
i
take
you
upstairs
to
your
own
room
no
i
think
i
should
faint
if
i
had
to
go
upstairs
i
answered
yet
i
ca
stay
here
what
shall
i
do
what
about
uncle
eric
study
di
asked
she
always
calls
lord
mountstuart
eric
though
he
is
her
uncle
her
mother
and
his
wife
were
sisters
that
all
and
then
there
was
the
other
sister
who
married
the
british
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
a
cousin
of
lord
mountstuart
that
family
seemed
to
have
a
craze
for
american
girls
but
lord
mountstuart
makes
an
exception
of
me
he
civil
of
course
because
he
an
abject
slave
of
di
and
she
refused
to
come
and
pay
a
visit
in
england
without
me
but
i
give
him
the
shivers
i
know
very
well
and
i
take
an
impish
joy
in
making
him
jump
i
sure
he
wo
be
there
this
evening
di
went
on
when
i
hesitated
he
playing
bridge
with
a
lot
of
dear
old
boys
in
the
library
or
was
half
an
hour
ago
come
let
me
help
you
there
it
only
a
step
she
put
her
pretty
arm
round
my
waist
and
leaning
on
her
i
walked
across
the
room
out
into
a
corridor
through
a
tiny
bookroom
where
odd
volumes
and
old
magazines
are
kept
into
lord
mountstuart
study
it
is
a
nice
room
which
he
uses
much
as
his
wife
uses
her
boudoir
the
library
next
door
is
rather
a
show
place
but
the
study
has
only
lord
mountstuart
favourite
books
in
it
he
writes
there
he
has
written
a
novel
or
two
and
thinks
himself
literary
and
some
pictures
he
has
painted
in
different
parts
of
the
world
hang
on
the
walls
for
he
also
fancies
himself
artistic
in
one
corner
is
a
particularly
comfortable
cushiony
lounge
where
i
suppose
the
distinguished
author
lies
and
thinks
out
his
subjects
or
dreams
them
out
and
it
was
to
this
that
di
led
me
she
settled
me
among
some
fat
pillows
of
old
purple
and
gold
brocade
and
asked
if
she
should
ring
and
get
a
little
brandy
no
i
said
i
shall
feel
better
in
a
few
minutes
it
so
nice
and
cool
here
you
look
better
already
exclaimed
di
soon
when
you
lain
and
rested
awhile
you
be
a
different
girl
ah
how
i
wish
i
be
a
different
girl
i
sighed
a
strong
well
girl
and
tall
and
beautiful
and
admired
by
everyone
like
you
or
maxine
de
renzie
what
makes
you
think
of
her
asked
di
quickly
ivor
was
just
talking
to
me
of
her
you
know
he
calls
me
his
and
tells
me
things
he
does
tell
everybody
he
thinks
a
great
deal
about
maxine
still
she
be
a
difficult
woman
to
forget
if
she
as
attractive
off
the
stage
as
she
is
on
what
a
pity
we
did
come
in
time
to
meet
here
when
she
was
playing
in
london
with
george
allendale
everybody
used
to
invite
her
to
their
houses
it
seems
ivor
was
telling
me
that
he
first
met
her
here
and
that
it
such
a
pleasant
memory
whenever
he
comes
to
this
house
i
suppose
that
one
reason
he
likes
to
come
so
much
no
doubt
said
di
sharply
he
got
so
fascinated
talking
of
her
i
went
on
he
almost
forgot
that
he
had
a
dance
with
allendale
of
course
maxine
had
made
a
great
hit
and
all
that
but
she
did
stand
quite
as
high
as
she
does
now
since
she
become
the
fashion
in
paris
perhaps
she
had
nothing
except
her
salary
then
whereas
she
must
have
saved
up
a
lot
of
money
by
this
time
i
have
an
idea
that
ivor
would
have
proposed
to
her
when
she
was
in
london
if
he
thought
her
success
established
nonsense
di
broke
out
her
cheeks
very
pink
as
if
ivor
were
the
kind
of
man
to
think
of
such
a
thing
he
is
very
rich
and
he
is
very
ambitious
it
would
be
bad
for
him
to
marry
a
poor
girl
or
a
girl
who
was
well
connected
socially
he
to
think
of
such
things
i
watched
the
effect
of
these
words
with
my
eyes
half
shut
for
of
course
di
has
all
her
mother
money
two
hundred
thousand
english
pounds
and
through
the
mountstuarts
and
her
aunt
who
is
married
to
the
foreign
secretary
she
has
got
to
know
all
the
best
people
in
england
besides
the
king
and
queen
have
been
particularly
nice
to
her
since
she
was
presented
so
she
has
the
run
of
their
special
set
as
well
as
the
political
and
artistic
and
exclusive
ones
ivor
dundas
is
a
law
unto
himself
she
said
and
he
has
plenty
of
good
connections
of
his
own
he
have
a
little
money
too
some
day
from
an
aunt
or
a
i
believe
anyway
he
and
miss
de
renzie
had
nothing
more
than
a
flirtation
aunt
lilian
told
me
so
she
said
maxine
was
rather
proud
to
have
ivor
dangling
about
because
everyone
likes
him
and
because
his
travels
and
his
book
were
being
a
lot
talked
about
just
then
naturally
he
admired
her
because
she
beautiful
and
a
very
great
actress
oh
your
aunt
lilian
would
make
little
of
the
affair
i
laughed
she
flirts
with
him
herself
why
lisa
aunt
lilian
over
forty
and
he
forty
is
the
end
of
the
world
for
a
woman
nowadays
she
a
beauty
and
a
great
lady
ivor
always
wants
the
best
of
everything
she
flirts
with
him
and
he
with
her
di
laughed
too
but
only
to
make
it
seem
as
if
she
did
care
better
not
say
such
silly
things
to
uncle
eric
she
said
staring
at
the
pattern
of
the
cornice
are
those
funny
gargoyley
faces
up
there
i
never
noticed
them
before
but
oh
about
dundas
and
maxine
de
renzie
i
do
think
really
that
he
troubles
himself
much
about
her
any
more
for
the
other
day
i
i
happened
to
ask
what
she
was
playing
in
paris
now
and
he
did
know
he
said
he
had
been
over
to
see
her
act
as
it
was
too
far
away
and
he
was
afraid
when
he
too
busy
he
was
too
lazy
he
so
to
you
of
course
but
when
he
spends
saturday
to
monday
at
folkestone
with
the
godmother
who
going
to
leave
him
her
money
how
easy
to
slip
over
the
channel
to
the
fair
maxine
without
anyone
being
the
wiser
why
should
he
slip
or
slide
or
steam
or
sail
in
a
balloon
if
he
likes
laughed
di
but
not
happily
you
looking
much
better
lisa
you
quite
a
colour
now
do
you
feel
strong
enough
to
go
upstairs
i
would
rather
rest
here
for
awhile
since
you
think
lord
mountstuart
is
sure
not
to
come
said
i
these
pillows
are
so
comfortable
then
perhaps
by
and
by
i
shall
feel
able
to
go
back
to
the
den
and
watch
the
dancing
i
should
like
to
keep
up
if
i
can
for
i
know
i
sleep
and
the
night
will
seem
so
long
very
well
said
di
speaking
kindly
though
i
knew
she
would
have
liked
to
shake
me
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
run
away
now
for
my
partner
will
think
me
so
rude
what
about
supper
oh
i
do
want
any
and
i
shall
have
gone
upstairs
before
that
i
interrupted
go
now
i
do
need
you
any
more
ring
and
send
for
me
if
you
feel
badly
again
yes
yes
by
this
time
she
was
at
the
door
and
there
she
turned
with
a
remorseful
look
in
her
eyes
as
if
she
had
been
unkind
and
was
sorry
even
if
you
do
send
i
shall
come
back
by
and
by
when
i
can
to
see
how
you
are
she
said
then
she
was
gone
and
i
nestled
deeper
into
the
sofa
cushions
with
the
feeling
that
my
head
was
so
heavy
it
must
weigh
down
the
pillows
like
a
stone
she
was
afraid
of
missing
number
with
ivor
i
said
to
myself
well
she
welcome
to
it
now
i
do
think
she
enjoy
it
much
or
let
him
oh
i
hope
they
quarrel
i
do
think
i
mind
anything
if
only
i
was
sure
they
never
be
nearer
to
each
other
i
wish
di
would
marry
lord
robert
perhaps
then
ivor
would
turn
to
me
oh
my
god
how
i
hate
her
and
all
beautiful
girls
who
spoil
the
lives
of
women
like
me
a
shivering
fit
shook
me
from
head
to
feet
as
i
guessed
that
the
time
must
be
coming
for
number
they
were
together
perhaps
what
if
in
spite
of
all
ivor
should
tell
di
how
he
loved
her
and
they
should
be
engaged
at
that
thought
i
tried
to
bring
on
a
heart
attack
and
die
for
at
least
it
would
chill
their
happiness
if
when
lady
ball
was
over
i
should
be
found
lying
white
and
dead
like
elaine
on
her
barge
i
was
holding
my
breath
with
my
hand
pressed
over
my
heart
to
feel
how
it
was
beating
when
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
i
heard
a
voice
speaking
chapter
ii
lisa
listens
someone
turned
up
the
light
i
leave
you
together
said
lord
mountstuart
and
the
door
was
closed
what
could
that
mean
i
wondered
i
had
supposed
the
two
men
had
come
in
alone
but
there
must
have
been
a
third
person
who
could
it
be
had
lord
mountstuart
been
arranging
a
between
di
and
ivor
dundas
the
thought
was
like
a
hand
on
my
throat
choking
my
life
out
i
must
hear
what
they
had
to
say
to
each
other
without
stopping
to
think
more
i
rolled
over
and
let
myself
sink
down
into
the
narrow
space
between
the
low
couch
and
the
wall
sharply
pulling
the
clinging
folds
of
my
chiffon
dress
after
me
then
i
lay
still
my
blood
pounding
in
my
temples
and
ears
and
in
my
nostrils
a
faint
musty
smell
from
the
oriental
stuff
that
covered
the
lounge
i
could
see
nothing
from
where
i
lay
except
the
side
of
the
couch
the
wall
and
a
bit
of
the
ceiling
with
the
gargoyley
cornice
which
di
had
mentioned
when
she
wanted
to
seem
indifferent
to
the
subject
of
our
conversation
but
i
was
listening
with
all
my
might
for
what
was
to
come
better
lock
the
door
if
you
please
dundas
said
a
voice
which
gave
me
a
shock
of
surprise
though
i
knew
it
well
instead
of
di
it
was
the
foreign
secretary
who
spoke
we
wo
run
the
risk
of
interruptions
he
went
on
with
that
slow
clear
enunciation
of
his
which
most
oxford
men
have
and
keep
all
their
lives
especially
men
of
the
college
that
was
his
balliol
i
told
mountstuart
that
i
wanted
a
private
chat
with
you
beyond
that
he
knows
nothing
nor
does
anyone
else
except
myself
you
understand
that
this
conversation
of
ours
whether
anything
comes
of
it
or
not
is
entirely
confidential
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
you
agree
to
it
or
not
as
you
choose
but
if
you
do
agree
forget
it
with
everything
i
may
have
said
my
services
and
my
memory
are
both
at
your
disposal
answered
ivor
in
such
a
gay
happy
voice
that
something
told
me
he
had
already
talked
with
diana
and
that
in
spite
of
me
she
had
not
snubbed
him
i
am
honoured
i
wo
say
flattered
for
i
too
much
in
earnest
that
you
should
place
any
confidence
in
me
i
lay
there
behind
the
lounge
and
sneered
at
this
speech
of
his
of
course
i
said
to
myself
he
would
be
ready
to
do
anything
to
please
the
foreign
secretary
since
all
the
big
plums
his
ambition
craved
were
in
the
gift
of
that
man
frankly
i
in
a
difficulty
and
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
you
can
help
me
out
of
it
better
than
anyone
else
i
know
said
the
smooth
trained
voice
it
is
a
little
diplomatic
errand
you
will
have
to
undertake
for
me
tomorrow
if
you
want
to
do
me
a
good
turn
i
will
undertake
it
with
great
pleasure
and
carry
it
through
to
the
best
of
my
ability
replied
ivor
i
sure
you
can
carry
it
through
excellently
said
the
foreign
secretary
still
fencing
it
will
be
good
practice
if
you
succeed
for
any
future
duties
in
the
career
which
may
be
opening
to
you
he
bribing
him
with
that
consulship
i
thought
beginning
to
be
very
curious
indeed
as
to
what
i
might
be
going
to
hear
my
heart
beating
so
thickly
now
i
could
think
almost
calmly
again
i
thank
you
for
your
trust
in
me
said
ivor
a
little
diplomatic
errand
repeated
the
foreign
secretary
in
itself
the
thing
is
not
much
that
is
on
the
face
of
it
and
yet
in
its
relation
with
other
interests
it
becomes
a
mission
of
vast
importance
incalculable
importance
when
i
have
explained
you
will
see
why
i
apply
to
you
indeed
i
came
to
my
cousin
mountstuart
house
expressly
because
i
was
told
you
would
be
at
his
wife
ball
my
regret
is
that
the
news
which
brought
me
in
search
of
you
did
reach
me
earlier
for
if
it
had
i
should
have
come
with
my
wife
and
have
got
at
you
in
time
to
send
you
off
if
you
agreed
to
go
as
it
is
the
matter
will
have
to
rest
till
morning
it
too
late
for
you
to
catch
the
midnight
boat
across
the
channel
across
the
channel
echoed
ivor
you
want
me
to
go
to
france
yes
one
could
always
get
across
somehow
said
ivor
thoughtfully
if
there
were
a
great
hurry
there
is
the
greatest
but
in
this
case
the
more
haste
the
less
speed
that
is
if
you
were
to
rush
off
order
a
special
train
and
charter
a
tug
or
motor
boat
at
dover
as
i
suppose
you
mean
my
object
would
probably
be
defeated
i
came
to
you
because
those
who
are
watching
this
business
would
be
likely
to
guess
i
had
given
you
a
hand
in
it
all
that
you
do
however
must
be
done
quietly
with
no
fuss
no
sign
of
anything
unusual
going
on
it
was
natural
i
should
come
to
a
ball
given
by
my
wife
sister
whose
husband
is
my
cousin
no
one
knows
of
this
interview
of
ours
i
believe
i
may
make
my
mind
easy
on
that
score
at
least
and
it
is
equally
natural
that
you
should
start
on
business
or
pleasure
of
your
own
for
paris
morning
also
that
you
should
meet
mademoiselle
de
renzie
there
mademoiselle
de
renzie
exclaimed
ivor
off
his
guard
for
an
instant
and
showing
plainly
that
he
was
taken
aback
is
she
a
friend
of
yours
asked
the
foreign
secretary
rather
sharply
though
i
could
see
him
i
knew
exactly
how
he
would
be
looking
at
ivor
his
keen
grey
eyes
narrowed
his
lips
drawn
in
the
long
hand
of
which
he
is
said
to
be
vain
toying
with
the
pale
malmaison
pink
he
always
wears
in
his
buttonhole
yes
she
is
a
friend
of
mine
ivor
answered
but
a
already
perhaps
i
better
tell
you
that
the
mission
has
to
do
with
mademoiselle
de
renzie
and
directly
with
no
one
else
she
has
acted
as
my
agent
in
paris
indeed
i
did
dream
that
she
dabbled
in
politics
and
you
should
not
dream
it
from
any
word
of
mine
dundas
if
it
were
necessary
to
be
entirely
open
with
you
if
you
are
to
help
me
in
this
matter
but
before
we
go
any
further
i
must
know
whether
mademoiselle
de
renzie
connection
with
this
business
will
for
any
reason
keep
you
out
of
it
not
if
you
need
my
help
said
ivor
with
an
effort
and
i
beg
you
wo
suppose
that
my
hesitation
has
anything
to
do
with
miss
de
renzie
herself
i
have
for
her
the
greatest
respect
and
admiration
we
all
have
returned
the
foreign
secretary
especially
those
who
know
her
best
among
her
many
virtues
she
one
of
the
few
women
who
can
keep
a
secret
her
own
and
others
she
is
a
magnificent
actress
on
the
stage
and
off
and
now
i
have
your
promise
to
help
me
i
must
tell
you
it
to
help
her
as
well
therefore
i
owe
you
the
whole
truth
or
you
will
be
handicapped
for
several
years
mademoiselle
de
renzie
has
done
good
service
secret
service
you
must
understand
for
great
britain
by
jove
maxine
a
political
spy
ivor
broke
out
impulsively
that
rather
a
hard
name
is
it
there
are
better
ones
and
no
traitor
to
her
country
because
as
you
perhaps
know
she
polish
by
birth
i
can
assure
you
we
much
for
which
to
thank
her
cleverness
and
tact
and
beauty
for
our
sakes
i
sorry
that
she
serving
our
interests
professionally
for
the
last
time
for
her
own
sake
i
ought
to
rejoice
as
she
engaged
to
be
married
and
if
you
can
save
her
from
coming
to
grief
over
this
very
ticklish
business
she
probably
live
happily
ever
after
did
you
know
of
her
engagement
no
replied
ivor
i
saw
miss
de
renzie
often
when
she
was
acting
in
london
a
year
ago
but
after
she
went
to
paris
of
course
she
very
busy
and
has
crowds
of
friends
and
i
only
crossed
once
or
twice
since
on
hurried
visits
so
we
have
met
or
written
to
each
other
very
good
reason
i
thought
bitterly
behind
my
sofa
you
been
busy
too
falling
in
love
with
diana
forrest
it
has
been
announced
yet
but
i
thought
as
an
old
friend
you
might
have
been
told
i
believe
mademoiselle
wants
to
surprise
everybody
when
the
right
time
comes
if
the
poor
girl
is
ruined
irretrievably
in
this
affair
of
ours
is
there
really
serious
danger
of
that
the
most
serious
if
you
ca
save
her
not
only
will
the
be
shaken
to
its
foundations
and
i
say
nothing
of
my
own
reputation
which
is
at
stake
but
her
future
happiness
will
be
broken
in
the
crash
and
she
says
she
will
not
live
to
suffer
the
agony
of
her
loss
she
will
kill
herself
if
disaster
comes
and
though
suicide
is
usually
the
last
resource
of
a
coward
mademoiselle
de
renzie
is
no
coward
and
i
inclined
to
think
i
should
come
to
the
same
resolve
in
her
place
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
said
ivor
evidently
moved
by
the
foreign
secretary
strange
words
and
his
intense
earnestness
you
will
go
to
paris
by
the
first
train
morning
without
mentioning
your
intention
to
anyone
you
will
drive
at
once
to
some
hotel
where
you
have
never
stayed
and
are
not
known
i
will
find
means
of
informing
the
lady
what
hotel
you
choose
you
will
there
give
a
fictitious
name
let
us
say
george
sandford
and
you
will
take
a
suite
with
a
private
that
done
you
will
say
that
you
are
expecting
a
lady
to
call
upon
you
and
will
see
no
one
else
you
will
wait
till
mademoiselle
de
renzie
appears
which
will
certainly
be
as
soon
as
she
can
possibly
manage
and
when
you
and
she
are
alone
together
sure
that
you
not
being
spied
upon
you
will
put
into
her
hands
a
small
packet
which
i
shall
give
you
before
we
part
it
sounds
simple
enough
said
ivor
if
that
all
it
is
all
yet
it
may
be
anything
but
simple
would
you
prefer
to
have
me
call
at
her
house
and
save
her
coming
to
a
hotel
i
willingly
do
so
if
no
as
i
told
you
should
it
be
known
that
you
and
she
meet
those
who
are
watching
her
at
present
ought
not
to
suspect
the
real
motive
of
the
meeting
so
much
the
better
for
us
but
we
must
think
of
her
after
four
every
afternoon
the
young
frenchman
she
engaged
to
is
in
the
habit
of
going
to
her
house
and
stopping
until
it
time
for
her
to
go
to
work
he
dines
with
her
but
does
drive
with
her
to
the
theatre
as
that
would
be
rather
too
public
for
the
present
until
their
engagement
announced
he
adores
her
but
is
inconveniently
jealous
like
most
latins
it
practically
certain
that
he
heard
your
name
mentioned
in
connection
with
hers
when
she
was
in
london
and
as
a
frenchman
invariably
fails
to
understand
that
a
man
can
admire
a
beautiful
woman
without
being
in
love
with
her
your
call
at
her
house
might
give
mademoiselle
maxine
a
quart
i
see
but
if
she
sends
him
away
and
comes
to
my
hotel
she
probably
make
some
excuse
about
being
obliged
to
go
to
the
theatre
early
and
thus
get
rid
of
him
she
quite
clever
enough
to
manage
that
then
as
your
own
name
wo
appear
on
any
hotel
list
in
the
papers
next
day
the
most
jealous
heart
need
have
no
cause
for
suspicion
at
the
same
time
if
certain
persons
whom
mademoiselle
and
we
too
have
to
fear
do
find
out
that
she
has
visited
ivor
dundas
who
has
assumed
a
false
name
for
the
pleasure
of
a
private
interview
with
her
interests
of
even
deeper
importance
than
the
most
desperate
love
affair
may
still
we
hope
be
guarded
by
the
pretext
of
your
old
friendship
now
you
understand
thoroughly
i
think
so
replied
ivor
very
grave
and
troubled
i
knew
by
the
change
in
his
manner
out
of
which
all
the
gaiety
had
been
slowly
drained
i
will
do
my
very
best
if
you
are
sacrificing
any
important
engagements
of
your
own
for
the
next
two
days
you
wo
suffer
for
it
in
the
end
remarked
the
foreign
secretary
meaningly
no
doubt
ivor
saw
the
consulship
at
algiers
dancing
before
his
eyes
bound
up
with
an
engagement
to
di
just
as
a
slice
of
rich
plum
cake
and
white
bride
cake
are
tied
together
with
bows
of
satin
ribbons
sometimes
in
america
i
did
want
him
to
have
the
consulship
because
getting
that
would
perhaps
mean
getting
di
too
thank
you
said
ivor
and
what
hotel
shall
you
choose
in
paris
asked
the
foreign
secretary
it
should
be
a
good
one
i
do
need
to
remind
you
where
mademoiselle
de
renzie
could
go
without
danger
of
compromising
herself
in
case
she
should
be
recognised
in
spite
of
the
veil
she
pretty
certain
to
wear
yet
it
should
be
in
too
central
a
situation
shall
it
be
the
élysèe
palace
asked
ivor
that
will
do
very
well
replied
the
other
after
reflecting
for
an
instant
and
i
could
have
clapped
my
hands
in
what
ivor
would
call
my
impish
joy
when
it
was
settled
for
the
élysèe
palace
is
where
lord
and
lady
mountstuart
stop
when
they
visit
paris
and
they
been
talking
of
running
over
next
day
with
lord
robert
west
to
look
at
a
wonderful
new
motor
car
for
sale
there
one
that
a
rajah
had
ordered
to
be
made
for
him
but
died
before
it
was
finished
lady
mountstuart
always
has
one
new
fad
every
six
months
at
least
and
her
latest
is
to
drive
a
motor
car
herself
lord
robert
is
a
great
expert
can
make
a
motor
i
believe
or
take
it
to
pieces
and
put
it
together
again
and
he
been
insisting
for
days
that
she
would
be
able
to
drive
this
rajah
car
promised
that
if
not
too
tired
she
cross
to
paris
the
day
after
the
ball
taking
the
afternoon
train
via
boulogne
as
she
would
be
equal
to
an
early
start
now
i
thought
how
splendid
it
would
be
if
she
should
see
maxine
at
the
hotel
with
ivor
the
foreign
secretary
was
advising
ivor
to
wire
the
élysèe
palace
for
rooms
without
any
delay
as
there
must
be
no
hitch
about
his
meeting
maxine
once
it
was
arranged
for
her
to
go
there
any
misunderstanding
would
be
fatal
he
went
on
as
solemnly
as
if
the
safety
of
head
depended
upon
ivor
trip
i
only
wish
i
could
have
got
you
off
and
in
that
case
you
might
have
gone
to
her
own
house
early
in
the
morning
she
is
in
a
frightful
state
of
mind
poor
girl
but
it
was
only
that
the
contents
of
the
packet
reached
me
and
was
shown
to
the
prime
minister
then
it
was
just
before
i
hurried
round
here
to
see
you
that
i
received
a
cypher
telegram
from
her
warning
me
that
count
godensky
of
whom
you
probably
heard
an
attaché
of
the
russian
embassy
in
paris
somehow
has
come
to
suspect
a
er
a
game
in
high
politics
which
she
and
i
have
been
playing
her
last
according
to
present
intentions
as
i
told
you
i
have
an
idea
that
this
man
well
known
in
paris
society
proposed
to
mademoiselle
de
renzie
refused
to
take
no
for
an
answer
and
bored
her
until
she
perhaps
was
goaded
into
giving
him
a
severe
snub
godensky
is
a
vain
man
and
forgive
a
snub
especially
if
it
had
got
talked
about
he
be
a
bad
enemy
and
mademoiselle
seems
to
think
that
he
is
a
very
bitter
and
determined
enemy
apparently
she
does
know
how
much
he
has
found
out
or
whether
he
has
actually
found
out
anything
at
all
or
merely
guesses
and
but
one
thing
is
unfortunately
certain
i
believe
every
boat
and
every
train
between
london
and
paris
will
be
watched
more
closely
than
usual
for
the
next
day
or
two
any
known
or
suspected
agent
would
get
through
unchallenged
but
i
can
see
no
reason
why
you
should
not
nor
i
answered
ivor
laughing
a
little
i
think
i
could
make
some
trouble
for
anyone
who
tried
to
stop
me
caution
above
all
remember
you
in
training
for
a
diplomatic
career
what
if
you
should
lose
the
packet
i
going
to
give
you
i
prophesy
that
in
hours
the
world
would
be
empty
of
maxine
de
renzie
for
the
circumstances
surrounding
her
in
this
transaction
are
peculiar
the
most
peculiar
i
ever
been
entangled
in
perhaps
in
rather
a
varied
experience
and
they
intimately
concern
her
fiancé
the
vicomte
raoul
du
laurier
raoul
du
laurier
exclaimed
ivor
so
she
engaged
to
marry
him
yes
do
you
know
him
i
have
friends
who
do
he
in
the
french
foreign
office
though
they
say
he
more
at
home
in
the
hunting
field
or
writing
plays
which
do
get
produced
quite
so
but
they
will
get
produced
some
day
for
i
believe
he
an
extremely
clever
fellow
in
his
way
in
everything
except
the
diplomatic
which
his
father
would
have
him
take
up
and
got
him
into
through
heaven
knows
what
influence
no
du
laurier
no
fool
and
is
said
to
be
a
fine
sportsman
as
well
as
almost
absurdly
mademoiselle
maxine
has
plenty
of
excuse
for
her
infatuation
for
i
assure
you
it
nothing
less
she
jump
into
the
fire
for
this
young
man
and
grill
with
a
joan
of
arc
smile
on
her
face
this
would
have
been
pleasant
hearing
for
ivor
if
he
ever
been
really
in
love
with
maxine
but
i
was
obliged
to
admit
to
myself
that
he
had
for
he
did
seem
to
care
in
the
least
on
the
contrary
he
grew
a
little
more
cheerful
i
can
see
that
du
laurier
being
in
the
french
foreign
office
might
make
it
rather
awkward
for
miss
de
renzie
if
she
if
she
been
rather
too
helpful
to
us
he
said
exactly
and
thereby
hangs
a
tale
a
sensational
and
even
romantic
tale
almost
complicated
enough
for
the
plot
of
a
novel
when
you
meet
mademoiselle
afternoon
or
evening
if
she
cares
to
take
you
into
her
confidence
in
reward
for
your
services
in
regard
to
some
private
interests
of
her
own
which
have
got
themselves
wildly
mixed
up
with
the
gravest
political
matters
she
at
liberty
to
do
so
as
far
as
i
concerned
for
you
are
to
be
trusted
and
deserve
to
be
trusted
you
may
say
that
to
her
from
me
if
the
occasion
arises
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
that
everything
may
go
smoothly
if
not
the
may
burst
like
a
bomb
i
who
have
made
myself
responsible
in
the
matter
with
the
clear
understanding
that
england
will
deny
me
if
the
scheme
a
failure
shall
be
shattered
by
a
flying
fragment
the
favourite
actress
of
paris
will
be
asphyxiated
by
the
poisonous
fumes
and
you
though
i
hope
no
worse
harm
may
come
to
you
will
mourn
for
the
misfortunes
of
others
your
responsibility
will
be
such
that
it
will
be
almost
as
if
you
carried
the
destructive
bomb
itself
until
you
get
the
packet
into
the
hands
of
maxine
de
renzie
good
heavens
i
shall
be
glad
when
she
has
it
said
ivor
you
ca
be
gladder
than
she
or
i
and
here
it
is
replied
the
foreign
secretary
i
consider
it
great
luck
to
have
found
such
a
messenger
at
a
house
i
could
enter
without
being
suspected
of
any
motive
more
subtle
than
a
wish
to
eat
a
good
supper
or
to
meet
some
of
the
prettiest
women
in
london
i
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
see
what
he
was
giving
ivor
to
take
to
maxine
and
i
was
half
tempted
to
lift
myself
up
and
peep
at
the
two
from
behind
the
lounge
but
i
could
tell
from
their
voices
that
they
were
standing
quite
near
and
it
would
have
been
too
dangerous
the
foreign
secretary
who
is
rather
a
nervous
man
and
fastidious
about
a
woman
looks
never
could
bear
me
and
i
believe
he
would
have
thought
it
almost
as
justifiable
as
drowning
an
ugly
kitten
to
choke
me
if
he
knew
i
overheard
his
secrets
however
ivor
next
words
gave
me
some
inkling
of
what
i
wished
to
know
it
importance
evidently
does
consist
in
bulk
he
said
lightly
i
can
easily
carry
the
case
in
my
breast
pocket
pray
put
it
there
at
once
and
guard
it
as
you
would
guard
the
life
and
honour
of
a
woman
said
the
foreign
secretary
solemnly
now
i
must
go
and
look
for
my
wife
it
better
that
you
and
i
should
be
seen
together
one
never
knows
who
may
have
got
in
among
the
guests
at
a
crush
like
this
i
will
go
out
at
one
door
and
when
you
waited
for
a
few
minutes
you
can
go
by
way
of
another
a
moment
later
there
was
silence
in
the
room
and
i
knew
that
ivor
was
alone
what
if
i
spoke
and
startled
him
all
that
is
impish
in
me
longed
to
see
how
his
face
would
look
but
there
was
too
much
at
stake
not
only
would
i
hate
to
have
him
scorn
me
for
an
eavesdropper
but
i
had
already
built
up
a
great
plan
for
the
use
i
could
make
of
what
i
had
overheard
chapter
iii
lisa
makes
mischief
when
ivor
was
safely
out
of
the
room
my
first
thought
was
to
escape
from
behind
the
lounge
and
get
upstairs
to
my
own
quarters
but
just
as
i
had
sat
up
very
cramped
and
wretched
with
one
foot
and
one
arm
asleep
lord
mountstuart
came
in
again
and
down
i
had
to
duck
he
had
brought
a
friend
who
was
as
mad
about
old
books
and
first
editions
as
he
a
stuffy
elderly
thing
who
had
never
seen
lord
mountstuart
treasures
before
as
both
were
perfectly
daft
on
the
subject
they
must
have
kept
me
lying
there
an
hour
while
they
fussed
about
from
one
to
another
murmuring
admiration
of
caxtons
or
discussing
the
value
of
a
mazarin
bible
with
their
noses
in
a
lot
of
old
volumes
which
ought
to
have
been
eaten
up
by
moths
long
ago
as
for
me
i
should
have
been
delighted
to
set
fire
to
the
whole
lot
at
last
lord
mountstuart
whom
i
nicknamed
stewey
remembered
that
there
was
a
ball
going
on
and
that
he
was
the
host
so
he
and
the
other
duffer
pottered
away
leaving
the
coast
clear
and
the
door
wide
open
it
was
just
my
luck
which
is
always
bad
and
always
has
been
that
a
pair
of
flirting
idiots
for
whom
the
conservatory
or
our
den
or
the
stairs
was
secluded
enough
must
needs
be
prying
about
and
spy
that
open
door
before
i
had
conquered
my
cramps
and
got
up
from
behind
the
sofa
the
dim
light
commended
itself
to
their
silliness
and
after
hesitating
a
minute
the
girl
whoever
she
was
allowed
herself
to
be
drawn
into
a
room
where
she
had
no
business
to
be
then
to
make
bad
worse
they
selected
the
lounge
to
sit
upon
and
i
had
to
lie
closely
wedged
against
the
wall
with
pins
and
needles
pricking
all
over
my
cramped
body
while
some
man
i
did
know
proposed
and
was
accepted
by
some
girl
i
shall
probably
never
see
they
continued
to
sit
making
a
tremendous
fuss
about
each
other
until
voices
were
heard
off
as
they
say
in
the
directions
for
theatricals
whereupon
they
sprang
up
and
hurried
out
like
guilty
things
upon
a
fearful
summons
by
that
time
i
was
more
dead
than
alive
but
i
did
manage
to
crawl
out
of
my
prison
and
creep
up
to
my
room
by
a
back
stairway
which
the
servants
use
but
it
was
very
late
now
and
people
were
going
even
the
young
ones
who
love
dancing
as
soon
as
i
was
able
i
scuttled
out
of
my
ball
dress
and
into
a
dressing
gown
also
i
undid
my
hair
which
is
my
one
beauty
and
let
it
hang
over
my
shoulders
streaming
down
in
front
on
each
side
so
that
nobody
would
know
one
shoulder
is
higher
than
the
other
it
was
that
i
was
particularly
anxious
to
appear
well
before
di
though
i
have
enough
vanity
not
to
like
the
contrast
between
us
to
seem
too
great
even
when
she
and
i
are
alone
but
because
i
wanted
her
to
think
when
she
came
to
my
room
that
i
been
there
a
long
time
i
was
sure
she
would
come
and
peep
in
at
the
door
to
steal
away
if
she
found
me
asleep
or
to
enquire
how
i
felt
if
i
were
awake
by
and
by
the
handle
of
the
door
moved
softly
just
as
i
had
expected
and
seeing
a
light
di
came
in
it
was
late
and
she
had
danced
all
night
but
instead
of
looking
tired
she
was
radiant
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
as
gay
and
happy
as
ivor
had
been
when
he
first
came
into
lord
mountstuart
study
with
the
foreign
secretary
i
said
that
i
was
much
better
and
had
had
a
nice
rest
that
if
i
wanted
to
hear
how
everything
had
gone
at
the
ball
i
should
have
been
in
bed
and
asleep
long
ago
everything
went
very
well
said
she
i
think
it
was
a
great
success
did
you
dance
every
dance
i
asked
working
up
slowly
to
what
i
meant
to
say
except
a
few
that
i
sat
out
i
can
guess
who
sat
them
out
with
you
said
i
ivor
dundas
and
one
was
number
thirteen
was
it
how
did
you
know
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
have
thirteen
with
you
oh
you
need
try
to
hide
anything
from
me
he
tells
most
things
to
his
was
he
nice
when
he
proposed
he
did
propose
i
give
you
the
sapphire
bracelet
lady
mountstuart
gave
me
if
he
did
tell
you
he
loved
you
and
ask
if
there
be
a
chance
for
him
in
case
he
got
algiers
i
would
take
your
bracelet
even
if
if
but
you
a
little
witch
lisa
of
course
i
am
i
exclaimed
smiling
though
i
had
a
sickening
wrench
of
the
heart
and
i
suppose
you
forgot
all
his
faults
and
failings
and
said
he
could
have
you
algiers
or
no
algiers
i
do
believe
he
has
all
those
faults
and
failings
you
were
talking
about
this
evening
said
di
with
her
cheeks
very
pink
he
may
have
flirted
a
little
at
one
time
women
have
spoiled
him
a
lot
but
but
he
love
me
lisa
and
he
did
love
maxine
i
laughed
he
did
he
never
loved
her
i
you
see
you
put
such
horrid
thoughts
into
my
head
that
that
i
just
mentioned
her
name
when
he
said
oh
when
he
said
the
usual
things
about
never
having
cared
seriously
for
anyone
until
he
saw
me
only
it
seems
treacherous
to
call
them
because
when
you
love
a
man
you
feel
that
the
things
he
says
can
never
have
been
said
before
in
the
same
way
by
any
other
man
to
any
other
woman
only
perhaps
by
the
same
man
to
another
woman
i
mocked
at
her
trying
to
act
as
if
i
were
teasing
in
fun
lisa
you
be
hateful
sometimes
she
cried
it
only
for
your
good
if
i
hateful
now
i
said
i
do
want
to
have
you
disappointed
when
it
too
late
i
want
you
to
keep
your
eyes
open
and
see
exactly
where
you
going
it
the
truest
thing
ever
said
that
is
blind
you
ca
deny
that
you
in
love
with
ivor
dundas
i
do
deny
it
she
answered
with
a
proud
air
which
would
i
suppose
have
made
ivor
want
to
kiss
her
and
you
did
deny
it
to
him
no
i
did
but
thanks
to
you
i
put
him
upon
a
kind
of
probation
i
wish
i
had
now
i
wish
i
shown
that
i
trusted
him
entirely
i
know
he
deserves
to
be
trusted
and
i
shall
tell
him
i
do
think
i
should
commit
myself
any
further
till
day
after
said
i
drily
indeed
you
could
if
you
wanted
to
unless
you
wrote
or
wired
you
wo
see
him
yes
i
shall
she
contradicted
me
opening
those
big
hazel
eyes
of
hers
that
looked
positively
black
with
excitement
he
going
to
the
duchess
of
glasgow
bazaar
because
i
said
i
should
most
likely
be
there
and
i
will
go
but
he
wo
how
can
you
know
anything
about
it
i
do
know
everything
and
i
tell
you
what
i
know
if
you
promise
me
two
things
what
things
that
you
wo
ask
me
how
i
found
out
and
that
you
swear
never
to
give
me
away
to
anybody
of
course
i
would
you
away
as
you
call
it
but
i
not
sure
i
want
you
to
tell
me
i
have
faith
in
ivor
i
rather
not
hear
stories
behind
his
back
oh
very
well
then
go
to
the
duchess
i
snapped
and
wear
your
prettiest
frock
to
please
ivor
when
just
about
that
time
he
be
arriving
in
paris
to
keep
a
very
particular
engagement
with
maxine
de
renzie
di
grew
suddenly
pale
and
her
eyes
looked
violet
instead
of
black
i
do
believe
he
going
to
paris
she
exclaimed
i
know
he
going
and
i
know
he
going
especially
to
see
maxine
it
ca
be
he
told
me
he
would
cross
the
street
to
see
her
i
i
made
it
a
condition
that
if
he
found
he
cared
enough
for
her
to
want
to
see
her
again
he
must
go
of
course
but
he
must
give
up
all
thought
of
me
if
i
to
reign
i
must
reign
alone
well
then
on
thinking
it
over
he
probably
did
find
that
he
wanted
to
see
her
no
for
he
loved
me
just
as
much
when
we
parted
only
half
an
hour
ago
yet
at
least
two
hours
ago
he
arranged
a
meeting
with
maxine
for
afternoon
you
dreaming
i
was
never
wider
awake
or
if
i
dreaming
you
can
dream
the
same
dream
if
you
be
at
victoria
station
or
rather
this
morning
when
the
boat
train
goes
out
at
i
will
be
there
cried
di
changing
from
red
to
white
and
you
shall
be
with
me
to
see
that
you
wrong
i
know
you
will
be
wrong
that
an
engagement
said
i
at
victoria
station
just
you
and
i
and
nobody
else
in
the
house
the
wiser
if
i
right
and
ivor
there
shall
you
think
it
wise
to
give
him
up
he
might
be
obliged
to
go
to
paris
suddenly
for
some
business
reason
without
meaning
to
call
on
maxine
de
renzie
in
which
case
he
probably
write
me
but
at
the
station
i
shall
ask
him
straight
out
that
is
if
he
there
as
i
sure
he
wo
be
whether
he
intends
to
see
mademoiselle
de
renzie
if
he
says
no
i
believe
him
if
he
says
yes
you
tell
him
all
is
over
between
you
he
know
that
without
my
telling
after
our
talk
last
night
and
whatever
happens
you
will
say
nothing
about
having
heard
name
from
me
nothing
di
answered
and
i
knew
she
would
keep
her
word
ivor
dundas
point
of
view
chapter
iv
ivor
travels
to
paris
it
is
rather
a
startling
sensation
for
a
man
to
be
caught
suddenly
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
so
to
speak
and
pitched
out
of
heaven
down
to
the
other
place
but
that
was
what
happened
to
me
when
i
arrived
at
victoria
station
on
my
way
to
paris
i
had
taken
my
ticket
and
hurried
on
to
the
platform
without
too
much
time
to
spare
i
been
warned
not
to
risk
observation
by
being
too
early
when
i
came
face
to
face
with
the
girl
whom
at
any
other
time
i
should
have
liked
best
to
meet
whom
at
that
particular
time
i
least
wished
to
meet
diana
forrest
the
imp
lisa
drummond
was
with
her
but
i
saw
only
di
at
first
di
looking
a
little
pale
and
harassed
but
beautiful
as
always
only
last
night
i
had
told
her
that
paris
had
no
attractions
for
me
i
had
said
that
i
did
care
to
see
maxine
de
renzie
yet
here
i
was
on
the
way
to
see
her
and
here
was
di
discovering
me
in
the
act
of
going
to
see
her
of
course
i
could
lie
and
i
suppose
some
men
even
men
of
honour
would
think
it
justifiable
as
well
as
wise
to
lie
in
such
a
case
when
explanations
were
forbidden
but
i
could
lie
to
a
girl
i
loved
as
i
love
diana
forrest
it
would
have
sickened
me
with
life
and
with
myself
to
do
it
and
it
was
with
the
knowledge
in
my
mind
that
i
could
not
and
would
not
lie
that
i
had
to
greet
her
with
a
conventional
good
morning
are
you
going
out
of
town
i
asked
with
my
hat
off
for
her
and
for
the
imp
whose
strange
little
weazened
face
i
now
saw
looking
over
my
tall
love
shoulders
it
had
never
before
struck
me
that
the
imp
was
like
a
cat
but
suddenly
the
resemblance
struck
me
something
in
the
poor
little
creature
expression
it
must
have
been
or
in
her
greenish
grey
eyes
which
seemed
at
that
moment
to
concentrate
all
the
knowledge
of
old
and
evil
things
that
has
ever
come
into
the
world
since
the
days
of
the
early
egyptians
when
a
cat
was
worshipped
no
i
not
going
out
of
town
di
answered
i
came
here
to
meet
you
in
case
you
should
be
leaving
by
this
train
and
i
brought
lisa
with
me
who
told
you
i
was
leaving
i
asked
hoping
for
a
second
or
two
that
the
foreign
secretary
had
confided
to
her
something
of
his
secret
guessing
ours
perhaps
and
that
my
unexpected
inexplicable
absence
might
injure
me
with
her
i
ca
tell
you
she
answered
i
did
believe
you
would
go
even
though
i
got
your
letter
by
the
eight
post
this
morning
i
glad
you
got
that
i
said
i
posted
it
soon
after
i
left
you
last
night
why
did
you
tell
me
when
we
were
bidding
each
other
that
you
would
be
able
to
see
me
this
afternoon
instead
of
waiting
to
write
frankly
and
honestly
i
said
for
i
had
to
say
it
just
at
the
moment
and
only
for
the
moment
i
forgot
about
the
duchess
of
bazaar
that
was
because
after
i
decided
to
drop
in
at
the
bazaar
something
happened
which
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
go
in
my
letter
i
begged
you
to
let
me
see
you
instead
and
now
i
beg
it
again
do
say
i
say
yes
on
one
condition
and
gladly
she
replied
with
an
odd
pale
little
smile
that
you
tell
me
where
you
going
this
morning
i
know
it
must
seem
horrid
in
me
to
ask
but
but
oh
ivor
it
horrid
really
you
would
think
it
horrid
if
you
could
understand
i
going
to
paris
i
answered
beginning
to
feel
as
if
i
had
a
cold
potato
where
my
heart
ought
to
be
i
am
obliged
to
go
on
business
you
did
say
anything
about
paris
in
your
letter
this
morning
when
you
told
me
you
could
come
to
the
duchess
said
di
looking
like
a
beautiful
unhappy
child
her
eyes
big
and
appealing
her
mouth
proud
you
only
mentioned
urgent
engagement
which
you
forgotten
i
thought
that
would
be
enough
to
explain
in
a
hurry
i
told
her
lamely
so
it
was
so
it
would
have
been
she
faltered
if
it
had
been
for
what
we
said
last
night
about
paris
and
then
i
ca
explain
to
you
ivor
any
more
than
it
seems
you
can
to
me
but
i
did
hear
you
meant
to
go
there
and
after
our
talk
i
could
believe
it
i
come
to
the
station
to
find
you
i
came
because
i
was
perfectly
sure
i
would
find
you
and
wanted
to
prove
that
i
had
found
you
yet
you
here
and
though
i
am
here
you
will
trust
me
just
the
same
i
said
as
firmly
as
i
could
of
course
i
trust
you
if
if
what
if
you
tell
me
just
one
little
tiny
thing
that
you
not
going
to
see
maxine
de
renzie
i
may
see
her
i
admitted
but
but
at
least
you
not
going
on
purpose
this
drove
me
into
a
corner
without
being
disloyal
to
the
foreign
secretary
i
could
not
deny
all
personal
desire
to
meet
maxine
yet
to
what
suspicion
was
i
not
laying
myself
open
in
confessing
that
i
deliberately
intended
to
see
her
having
sworn
by
all
things
a
man
does
swear
by
when
he
wishes
to
please
a
girl
that
i
did
wish
to
see
maxine
and
would
not
see
maxine
you
said
you
trust
me
di
i
reminded
her
for
heaven
sake
break
that
promise
but
if
you
breaking
a
promise
to
me
a
promise
worse
then
because
i
did
ask
you
to
promise
i
had
too
much
faith
in
you
for
that
i
believed
you
when
you
said
you
did
care
for
anyone
but
me
i
told
lisa
it
does
matter
our
speaking
like
this
before
her
i
asked
you
to
wait
for
my
promise
for
a
little
while
until
i
could
be
quite
sure
you
did
think
of
miss
de
renzie
as
some
people
fancied
you
did
if
you
wanted
to
see
her
i
said
you
must
go
and
you
laughed
at
the
idea
yet
the
very
next
morning
by
the
first
train
you
start
only
because
i
am
obliged
to
i
hazarded
in
spite
of
the
foreign
secretary
and
his
precautions
but
i
was
punished
for
my
lack
of
them
by
making
matters
worse
instead
of
better
for
myself
obliged
to
she
echoed
then
there
something
you
must
settle
with
her
before
you
can
be
free
the
guard
was
shutting
the
carriage
doors
in
another
minute
i
should
lose
the
train
and
i
must
not
lose
the
train
for
her
future
and
mine
as
well
as
maxine
i
must
not
dearest
i
said
hurriedly
i
am
free
there
no
question
of
freedom
yet
i
shall
have
to
go
i
hold
you
to
your
word
trust
me
not
if
you
go
to
her
this
day
of
all
days
the
words
were
wrung
from
the
poor
child
lips
i
could
see
by
sheer
anguish
and
it
was
like
death
to
me
that
i
should
have
to
cause
her
this
anguish
instead
of
soothing
it
you
shall
you
must
i
commanded
rather
than
implored
darling
precious
one
i
shall
think
of
you
every
instant
and
i
shall
come
back
to
you
you
need
you
need
never
come
to
me
again
she
said
white
lipped
and
the
guard
whistled
waving
his
green
flag
do
dare
to
say
such
a
cruel
thing
a
thing
you
do
mean
i
cried
catching
at
the
closed
door
of
a
compartment
as
i
did
so
a
little
man
inside
jumped
to
the
window
and
shouted
reserved
do
you
see
it
reserved
which
explained
the
fact
that
the
door
seemed
to
be
fastened
i
stepped
back
my
eyes
falling
on
the
label
to
which
the
man
pointed
and
would
have
tried
the
handle
of
the
next
carriage
had
not
two
men
rushed
at
the
door
as
the
train
began
to
move
and
dexterously
opened
it
with
a
railway
key
their
throwing
themselves
thus
in
my
way
would
have
lost
me
my
last
chance
of
catching
the
moving
train
had
i
not
dashed
in
after
them
if
i
could
choose
i
would
be
the
last
man
to
obtrude
myself
where
i
was
not
wanted
but
there
was
no
time
to
choose
and
i
was
thankful
to
get
in
anywhere
rather
than
break
my
word
besides
my
heart
was
too
sore
at
leaving
diana
as
i
had
had
to
leave
her
to
care
much
for
anything
else
i
had
just
sense
enough
to
fight
my
way
in
though
the
two
men
with
the
key
not
the
one
who
had
occupied
the
compartment
first
now
yelled
that
it
was
reserved
and
would
have
pushed
me
out
if
i
had
been
too
strong
for
them
i
had
a
dim
impression
that
instead
of
joining
with
the
newcomers
the
first
man
who
would
have
kept
the
place
to
himself
before
their
entrance
seemed
willing
to
aid
me
against
the
others
they
being
once
foisted
upon
him
he
appeared
to
wish
for
my
presence
too
or
else
he
merely
desired
to
prevent
me
from
being
dashed
onto
the
platform
and
perhaps
killed
for
he
thrust
out
a
hand
and
tried
to
pull
me
in
at
the
same
time
a
guard
came
along
protesting
against
the
unseemly
struggle
and
the
carriage
door
was
slammed
shut
upon
us
all
four
when
i
got
my
balance
and
was
able
to
look
out
the
train
had
gone
so
far
that
diana
and
lisa
had
been
swept
away
from
my
sight
it
was
like
a
bad
omen
and
the
fear
was
cold
upon
me
that
i
had
lost
my
love
for
ever
at
that
moment
i
suffered
so
atrociously
that
if
it
had
not
been
too
late
i
fear
i
should
have
sacrificed
maxine
and
the
foreign
secretary
and
even
the
provided
he
had
not
been
exaggerating
for
di
sake
and
love
sake
but
there
was
no
going
back
now
even
if
i
would
the
train
was
already
travelling
almost
at
full
speed
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
resign
myself
to
the
inevitable
and
hope
for
the
best
someone
it
was
clear
had
tried
to
work
mischief
between
diana
and
me
and
there
were
only
too
many
chances
that
he
had
succeeded
could
it
be
bob
west
i
asked
myself
as
i
looked
for
a
place
to
sit
down
among
the
litter
of
small
luggage
with
which
the
first
occupant
of
the
carriage
had
strewn
every
seat
i
knew
that
bob
was
as
much
in
love
with
di
as
a
man
of
his
rather
unintellectual
unimaginative
type
could
be
and
he
had
shown
himself
as
friendly
lately
to
me
as
he
once
had
still
i
did
think
he
was
the
sort
of
fellow
to
trip
up
a
rival
in
the
race
by
a
trick
even
if
he
could
possibly
have
found
out
that
i
was
going
to
paris
this
morning
wo
you
sit
here
sir
a
voice
broke
into
my
thoughts
and
i
saw
that
the
little
man
had
cleared
a
place
for
me
next
his
own
which
was
in
a
corner
facing
the
engine
thanking
him
i
sat
down
and
began
to
observe
my
travelling
companions
for
the
first
time
so
far
their
faces
had
been
mere
blurs
for
me
but
now
it
struck
me
that
all
three
were
rather
peculiar
that
is
peculiar
when
seen
in
a
carriage
the
man
who
had
reserved
the
compartment
for
himself
and
who
had
removed
a
bundle
of
golf
sticks
from
the
seat
to
make
room
for
me
did
not
look
like
a
typical
golfer
nor
did
he
appear
at
all
the
sort
of
person
who
might
be
expected
to
reserve
a
whole
compartment
for
himself
he
was
small
and
thin
and
weedy
with
little
blinking
eyes
of
the
kind
which
ought
to
have
had
white
lashes
instead
of
the
sparse
jet
black
ones
that
rimmed
them
his
forehead
though
narrow
suggested
shrewdness
as
did
the
expression
of
those
light
coloured
eyes
of
his
which
were
set
close
to
the
sharp
slightly
nose
his
hair
was
so
black
that
it
made
his
skin
seem
singularly
pallid
though
it
was
only
sallow
and
a
mean
rabbit
mouth
worked
nervously
over
two
prominent
teeth
though
his
clothes
were
good
and
new
they
had
the
air
of
having
been
bought
ready
made
and
in
spite
of
his
smart
get
up
the
man
who
might
have
been
anywhere
between
thirty
and
looked
somewhat
like
an
or
bookmaker
masquerading
as
a
swell
the
two
intruders
who
had
violated
the
sanctity
of
the
reserved
compartment
by
means
of
their
railway
key
were
both
bigger
and
more
manly
than
he
who
had
a
right
to
it
one
was
dark
and
probably
jewish
with
a
heavy
beard
and
moustache
in
the
midst
of
which
his
sensual
and
cruel
mouth
pouted
disagreeably
red
the
other
was
puffy
and
flushed
with
a
complexion
deeply
pitted
by
smallpox
they
also
were
flashily
dressed
with
horsey
neckties
and
conspicuous
as
i
glanced
at
the
pair
they
were
talking
together
in
a
low
voice
with
an
open
newspaper
held
up
between
them
but
the
man
who
had
helped
me
in
against
their
will
sat
silent
staring
out
of
the
window
and
uneasily
fingering
his
collar
not
one
of
the
trio
was
apparently
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
me
now
that
i
was
seated
nevertheless
i
thought
of
the
large
long
which
i
carried
in
an
inner
breast
pocket
of
my
carefully
buttoned
coat
i
would
not
attract
attention
to
the
contents
of
that
pocket
by
touching
it
to
assure
myself
that
it
was
safe
but
i
had
done
so
just
before
meeting
di
and
i
felt
certain
that
nothing
could
have
happened
to
it
since
i
folded
my
arms
across
my
chest
glanced
up
to
see
where
the
cord
of
communication
might
be
found
in
case
of
emergency
and
then
reflected
that
these
men
were
not
likely
to
be
dangerous
since
i
had
followed
them
into
the
compartment
not
they
me
this
thought
was
reassuring
as
they
were
three
to
one
if
they
combined
against
me
and
the
train
was
unfortunately
not
entirely
a
corridor
train
therefore
having
assured
myself
that
i
was
not
among
spies
bent
on
having
my
life
or
the
secret
i
carried
i
forgot
about
my
and
fell
into
gloomy
speculations
as
to
my
chances
with
diana
i
had
been
loving
her
thinking
of
little
else
but
her
and
my
hopes
of
her
for
many
months
now
but
never
had
i
realised
what
a
miserable
empty
world
it
would
be
for
me
without
di
for
my
own
as
i
did
now
when
i
had
perhaps
lost
her
not
that
i
would
allow
myself
to
think
that
i
could
not
get
her
back
i
would
not
think
it
i
would
force
her
to
believe
in
me
to
trust
me
even
to
repent
her
suspicions
though
appearances
were
all
against
me
and
heaven
knew
how
much
or
when
i
might
be
permitted
to
explain
i
would
not
be
a
man
if
i
took
her
at
her
word
and
let
her
slip
from
me
no
matter
how
many
times
that
word
were
repeated
so
i
told
myself
over
and
over
yet
a
voice
inside
me
seemed
to
say
that
nothing
could
be
as
it
had
been
that
i
sacrificed
my
happiness
to
please
a
stranger
and
to
save
a
woman
whom
i
had
never
really
loved
di
was
so
beautiful
so
sweet
so
used
to
being
admired
by
men
there
were
so
many
who
loved
her
so
many
with
a
thousand
times
more
to
offer
than
i
had
or
would
ever
have
how
could
i
hope
that
she
would
go
on
caring
for
me
after
what
had
happened
i
wondered
she
said
in
actual
words
last
night
that
she
would
marry
me
whereas
this
morning
she
had
almost
said
she
never
would
i
should
have
nobody
to
blame
but
myself
if
i
came
back
to
london
to
find
her
engaged
to
lord
robert
west
a
man
who
as
his
brother
has
no
children
might
some
day
make
her
a
duchess
sorry
to
have
seemed
rude
just
now
sir
said
one
of
the
two
men
suddenly
reminding
me
of
his
unnecessary
existence
hardly
knew
what
i
was
about
when
i
shoved
you
away
from
the
door
me
and
my
friend
was
afraid
of
missing
the
train
so
we
pushed
instinct
of
i
suppose
and
he
chuckled
as
if
he
had
got
off
some
witticism
anyhow
i
apologise
nothing
intentional
my
word
thanks
no
apology
is
necessary
i
replied
as
indifferently
as
i
felt
that
all
right
then
finished
the
man
who
had
spoken
he
turned
to
his
companion
and
the
two
resumed
their
conversation
behind
the
newspaper
but
i
now
became
conscious
that
they
occasionally
glanced
over
the
top
at
their
neighbour
or
at
me
as
if
their
whole
attention
were
not
taken
up
with
the
news
of
the
day
any
interest
they
might
feel
in
me
provided
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
a
certain
pocket
they
were
welcome
to
but
the
little
man
was
apparently
not
of
the
same
mind
concerning
himself
his
nervously
twitching
hand
on
the
upholstered
which
separated
his
place
from
mine
attracted
my
attention
which
was
then
drawn
up
to
his
face
he
was
so
sickly
pale
under
a
kind
of
yellowish
glaze
spread
over
his
complexion
that
i
thought
he
must
be
ill
perhaps
suffering
from
train
sickness
in
anxious
anticipation
of
the
horrors
which
might
be
in
store
for
him
on
the
boat
presently
he
pulled
out
a
handkerchief
and
unobtrusively
wiped
his
forehead
under
his
checked
travelling
cap
when
he
had
done
this
i
saw
that
his
hair
was
left
streaked
with
damp
and
there
was
a
faint
purplish
stain
on
the
handkerchief
observing
which
with
evident
dismay
he
stuffed
the
big
square
of
coarse
cambric
hastily
into
his
pocket
the
little
beast
must
dye
his
hair
i
thought
contemptuously
perhaps
he
an
albino
really
his
eyes
look
like
it
with
that
he
threw
a
frightened
glance
at
me
which
caused
me
to
turn
away
and
spare
him
the
humiliation
of
knowing
that
he
was
observed
but
immediately
after
he
made
an
effort
to
pull
himself
together
picking
up
a
book
he
had
laid
down
to
wipe
his
forehead
and
holding
it
so
close
to
his
nose
that
the
printed
page
must
have
been
a
mere
blur
unless
he
were
very
thus
he
sat
for
some
time
yet
i
felt
that
no
look
thrown
by
the
other
two
was
lost
on
him
he
seemed
to
know
each
time
one
of
them
peered
over
the
newspaper
and
when
at
last
the
train
slowed
down
by
the
admiralty
pier
all
his
nervousness
returned
his
small
thin
hands
freckled
on
their
backs
hovered
over
one
piece
of
luggage
after
another
as
if
he
could
not
decide
how
to
pile
the
things
together
naturally
i
had
not
brought
my
man
with
me
on
this
errand
therefore
i
had
let
my
suitcase
go
into
the
van
that
i
might
have
both
hands
free
and
i
had
nothing
to
do
when
the
train
stopped
but
jump
out
and
make
for
the
boat
nevertheless
i
lingered
folding
up
a
newspaper
and
tearing
an
article
out
of
a
magazine
by
way
of
excuse
for
it
was
not
my
object
to
be
caught
in
a
crowd
and
hustled
perhaps
by
some
clever
wretches
who
might
be
lying
in
wait
for
what
i
had
in
my
pocket
it
seemed
impossible
that
anyone
could
have
learned
that
i
was
playing
messenger
between
the
british
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
and
maxine
de
renzie
still
the
danger
and
difficulty
of
the
apparently
simple
mission
had
been
so
strongly
impressed
on
me
that
i
did
not
intend
to
neglect
any
precaution
i
lingered
therefore
and
the
man
with
his
friend
lingered
also
for
some
reason
of
their
own
they
had
no
luggage
except
a
small
handbag
each
but
these
they
opened
at
the
last
minute
to
stuff
in
their
newspapers
and
apparently
to
review
the
other
contents
presently
when
the
first
rush
for
the
boat
was
over
and
the
porters
who
had
come
to
the
door
of
our
compartment
had
gone
away
i
would
have
got
out
had
i
not
caught
an
imploring
glance
from
the
little
man
who
had
reserved
the
carriage
perhaps
i
imagined
it
but
his
eyes
seemed
to
say
for
heaven
sake
do
leave
me
alone
with
these
others
would
you
be
so
very
kind
sir
he
said
to
me
to
beckon
a
porter
as
you
are
near
the
door
i
find
after
all
that
i
sha
be
able
to
carry
everything
myself
i
did
as
he
asked
and
there
was
so
much
confusion
in
the
carriage
when
the
porter
came
that
in
the
two
friends
got
out
with
their
bags
i
also
descended
and
would
have
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
crowd
if
the
little
man
had
not
called
after
me
he
had
lost
his
ticket
he
said
would
i
be
so
extremely
obliging
as
to
throw
an
eye
about
the
platform
to
see
if
it
had
fallen
there
i
did
oblige
him
in
this
manner
without
avail
but
by
this
time
he
had
found
the
missing
treasure
in
the
folds
of
his
travelling
rug
and
scrambling
out
of
the
carriage
attended
by
the
porter
i
had
secured
for
him
he
would
have
walked
by
my
side
towards
the
boat
had
i
not
dropped
behind
a
few
steps
thinking
as
always
of
the
contents
of
that
inner
breast
pocket
he
and
i
were
now
at
the
of
the
procession
hastening
boatward
or
almost
at
the
tail
for
there
were
but
four
or
five
other
passengers
a
family
party
with
a
fat
nurse
and
crying
baby
behind
us
as
i
approached
the
gangway
i
saw
on
deck
my
late
travelling
companions
the
jewish
man
and
his
friend
regarding
us
with
interest
then
just
as
i
was
about
to
step
on
board
almost
on
the
little
heels
there
came
a
cry
apparently
from
someone
ahead
look
out
gangway
falling
in
an
instant
all
was
confusion
the
fat
nurse
behind
me
screamed
as
the
nervous
fellow
in
front
leaped
like
a
cat
intent
on
saving
himself
no
matter
what
happened
to
anyone
else
and
flung
me
against
the
woman
with
the
baby
two
or
three
excitable
frenchmen
just
ahead
also
attempted
to
turn
thus
nearly
throwing
the
little
man
onto
his
knees
the
large
bag
which
he
carried
hit
me
across
the
shins
in
his
terror
he
almost
embraced
me
as
he
helped
himself
up
the
nurse
as
she
stumbled
pitched
forward
onto
my
shoulder
and
if
i
had
not
seized
the
howling
baby
it
would
certainly
have
fallen
under
our
feet
my
bowler
was
knocked
over
my
eyes
and
though
an
officer
of
the
boat
cried
the
reassuring
intelligence
that
it
was
a
false
alarm
that
the
gangway
was
all
right
and
never
had
been
anything
but
all
right
i
could
not
readjust
my
hat
nor
see
what
was
going
on
until
the
fat
nurse
had
obligingly
retrieved
her
charge
without
a
word
of
thanks
my
first
thought
was
for
the
in
my
pocket
for
i
had
a
horrible
idea
that
the
scare
might
have
been
got
up
for
the
express
purpose
of
robbing
me
of
it
but
i
could
feel
its
outline
as
plainly
as
ever
under
my
coat
and
decided
thankfully
that
after
all
the
alarm
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
had
wired
for
a
private
cabin
thinking
it
would
be
well
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
my
during
the
crossing
but
the
weather
had
been
rough
for
a
day
or
two
it
was
not
yet
the
middle
of
april
and
everything
was
already
engaged
therefore
i
walked
the
deck
most
of
the
time
always
conscious
of
the
unusual
thickness
of
my
breast
pocket
the
little
man
paced
up
and
down
too
though
his
yellow
face
grew
slowly
green
and
he
would
have
been
much
better
off
below
lying
on
his
back
as
for
the
two
others
they
also
remained
on
deck
talking
together
as
they
leaned
against
the
rail
but
though
i
passed
them
now
and
again
i
noticed
that
the
little
man
invariably
avoided
them
by
turning
before
he
reached
their
pitch
at
the
gare
du
nord
i
regretted
that
i
had
not
carried
my
own
bag
because
if
i
had
it
would
have
been
examined
on
the
boat
and
all
bother
would
have
been
over
but
rather
than
run
any
risks
in
the
crowd
thronging
the
i
decided
to
let
the
suitcase
look
after
itself
and
send
down
for
it
with
the
key
from
the
hotel
later
again
the
little
man
was
close
to
my
side
as
i
went
in
search
of
a
cab
for
all
his
things
had
been
gone
through
by
the
custom
house
officer
in
so
that
he
too
was
free
to
depart
without
delay
he
even
seemed
to
cling
to
me
somewhat
wistfully
and
i
half
thought
he
meant
to
speak
but
he
did
not
save
for
a
good
evening
sir
as
i
separated
myself
from
him
at
last
he
had
stuck
rather
too
close
elbow
to
elbow
but
i
had
no
fear
for
the
as
he
was
on
the
wrong
side
to
play
any
conjurer
tricks
with
that
the
last
i
saw
of
the
fellow
he
was
walking
toward
a
cab
and
looking
uneasily
over
his
shoulder
at
his
two
late
travelling
companions
who
were
getting
into
another
vehicle
near
by
i
went
straight
to
the
élysée
palace
hotel
where
i
had
never
stopped
before
a
long
drive
from
the
gare
du
nord
and
claimed
the
rooms
for
which
george
sandford
had
wired
from
london
the
suite
engaged
was
a
charming
one
and
the
private
salon
almost
worthy
to
receive
the
lovely
lady
i
expected
nor
did
she
keep
me
waiting
i
had
had
time
only
to
give
instructions
about
sending
a
man
with
a
key
to
the
station
for
my
luggage
to
say
that
a
lady
would
call
to
reach
my
rooms
and
to
draw
the
curtains
over
the
windows
when
a
knock
came
at
the
salon
door
i
was
in
the
act
of
turning
on
the
electric
light
when
this
happened
but
to
my
surprise
the
room
remained
in
darkness
or
rather
in
a
pink
dusk
lent
by
the
colour
of
the
curtains
the
lady
has
arrived
monsieur
announced
the
servant
as
monsieur
expected
her
she
has
come
up
without
waiting
but
i
regret
that
something
has
gone
wrong
with
the
electricity
all
over
the
hotel
it
was
but
just
now
discovered
at
time
for
turning
on
the
lights
otherwise
lamps
and
plenty
of
candles
would
have
been
provided
though
no
doubt
the
light
will
fonctionne
properly
in
a
few
minutes
if
monsieur
permits
i
will
instantly
bring
him
a
lamp
no
thank
you
i
said
hurriedly
for
i
did
not
wish
to
be
interrupted
in
the
midst
of
my
important
interview
with
maxine
if
the
light
comes
on
it
will
he
all
right
if
not
i
will
put
back
the
curtains
and
it
is
not
yet
quite
dark
show
the
lady
in
into
the
pink
twilight
of
the
curtained
room
came
maxine
de
renzie
whose
tall
and
noble
figure
i
recognised
in
its
plain
black
dress
though
her
wide
brimmed
hat
was
draped
with
a
thickly
embroidered
veil
that
completely
hid
her
face
while
long
graceful
lace
folds
fell
over
and
obscured
the
bright
auburn
of
her
hair
one
moment
i
said
let
me
push
the
curtains
back
the
electricity
has
failed
no
no
she
answered
better
leave
them
as
they
are
the
lights
may
come
on
and
we
be
seen
from
outside
why
as
she
drew
nearer
to
me
and
the
servant
closed
the
door
i
thought
i
recognised
that
voice
it
is
ivor
dundas
no
other
said
i
did
the
were
you
warned
who
would
be
the
man
to
come
no
she
replied
only
the
assumed
name
of
the
messenger
and
place
of
meeting
were
wired
it
was
safer
so
even
though
the
telegram
was
in
a
cypher
which
i
trust
nobody
knows
except
myself
and
one
other
but
glad
glad
it
you
it
was
clever
of
him
to
have
sent
you
no
one
would
dream
that
no
one
would
think
it
strange
if
they
knew
as
i
hope
they
wo
that
you
came
to
paris
to
see
me
oh
the
relief
that
got
through
safely
nothing
has
happened
you
have
the
paper
nothing
has
happened
and
i
have
the
paper
i
reassured
her
no
adventures
to
speak
of
on
the
way
and
no
reason
to
think
i
been
spotted
anyway
here
i
am
and
here
is
something
which
will
put
an
end
to
your
anxiety
and
i
tapped
the
breast
of
my
coat
meaningly
thank
god
breathed
maxine
with
a
thrilling
note
in
her
voice
which
would
have
done
her
great
credit
on
the
stage
though
i
am
sure
she
was
never
further
in
her
life
from
the
thought
of
acting
after
all
suffered
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
give
it
to
me
quick
ivor
and
let
me
go
i
will
i
said
but
you
might
seem
to
take
just
a
little
more
interest
in
me
even
if
you
do
really
feel
it
you
know
you
might
just
say
have
you
been
for
the
last
twelve
months
oh
i
do
take
an
interest
and
i
grateful
to
you
i
ca
tell
you
how
grateful
but
i
have
no
time
to
think
either
of
you
or
myself
now
she
said
eagerly
if
you
knew
everything
you
understand
i
know
practically
nothing
i
confessed
still
i
do
understand
i
was
only
teasing
you
forgive
me
i
ought
to
have
done
it
even
for
a
minute
here
is
the
which
the
foreign
which
was
given
to
me
to
bring
to
you
wait
she
exclaimed
still
in
the
half
whisper
from
which
she
had
never
departed
wait
it
will
he
better
to
lock
the
door
but
even
as
she
spoke
there
came
a
knock
loud
and
insistent
with
a
spring
she
flung
herself
on
me
her
hand
fumbling
for
the
pocket
i
had
tapped
suggestively
a
moment
ago
i
let
her
draw
out
the
long
case
which
i
had
been
guarding
the
case
i
had
not
once
touched
since
leaving
london
except
to
feel
anxiously
for
its
outline
through
my
buttoned
coat
at
least
whatever
might
be
about
to
happen
she
had
it
in
her
own
hands
now
neither
of
us
spoke
nor
made
a
sound
during
the
instant
that
she
clung
to
me
the
faint
perfume
of
her
hair
her
dress
in
my
nostrils
but
as
she
started
away
and
i
knew
that
she
had
the
the
knock
came
again
then
before
i
could
be
sure
whether
she
wished
for
time
to
hide
or
whether
she
would
have
me
cry
come
in
without
seeming
to
hesitate
the
door
opened
for
a
second
or
two
maxine
and
i
and
a
group
of
figures
at
the
door
were
mere
shadows
in
the
ever
deepening
pink
dusk
but
i
could
scarcely
have
counted
ten
before
the
long
expected
light
sprang
up
i
had
turned
it
on
in
more
than
one
place
and
a
sudden
brilliant
illumination
showed
me
a
tall
commissary
of
police
with
two
little
gendarmes
looking
over
his
shoulder
i
threw
a
glance
at
maxine
who
was
still
veiled
and
was
relieved
to
see
that
she
had
found
some
means
of
putting
the
out
of
sight
having
ascertained
this
i
sharply
enquired
in
french
what
in
the
devil
name
the
commissary
of
police
meant
by
walking
into
an
englishman
room
without
being
invited
and
not
only
that
but
what
under
heaven
he
wanted
anyway
he
was
far
more
polite
than
i
was
ten
thousand
pardons
monsieur
he
apologised
i
knocked
twice
but
hearing
no
answer
entered
thinking
that
perhaps
after
all
the
salon
was
unoccupied
important
business
must
be
my
excuse
i
have
to
request
that
monsieur
dundas
will
first
place
in
my
hands
the
gift
he
has
brought
from
london
to
mademoiselle
de
renzie
i
have
brought
no
gift
for
mademoiselle
de
renzie
i
prevaricated
boldly
but
the
man
knowledge
of
my
name
was
ominous
if
the
paris
police
had
contrived
to
learn
it
already
as
well
as
to
find
out
that
i
was
the
bearer
of
something
for
maxine
it
looked
as
if
they
knew
enough
to
play
the
game
in
their
own
way
whatever
that
might
be
perhaps
i
should
say
the
thing
which
mademoiselle
lent
to
a
friend
in
england
and
monsieur
has
now
kindly
returned
amended
the
commissary
of
police
as
politely
as
patiently
as
ever
really
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
said
shrugging
my
shoulders
and
looking
bewildered
or
hoping
that
i
looked
bewildered
all
the
while
i
was
wondering
desperately
if
this
meant
ruin
for
maxine
or
if
she
would
still
find
some
way
of
saving
herself
but
all
i
could
do
for
her
at
the
moment
was
to
keep
calm
and
tell
as
many
lies
as
necessary
i
had
been
able
to
lie
to
diana
but
i
had
no
compunctions
about
doing
it
now
if
it
were
to
help
maxine
the
worst
was
that
i
was
far
from
sure
it
would
help
her
i
trust
monsieur
that
you
do
not
wish
to
prevent
the
french
police
from
doing
their
duty
said
the
officer
his
tone
becoming
peremptory
for
the
first
time
should
you
attempt
it
i
should
unfortunately
be
compelled
to
order
that
monsieur
be
searched
you
seem
to
forget
that
you
dealing
with
a
british
subject
said
i
who
is
offending
against
the
laws
of
a
friendly
country
he
capped
my
words
you
can
complain
afterwards
monsieur
but
now
why
do
you
empty
your
pockets
dundas
suggested
maxine
lightly
yet
contemptuously
and
show
them
that
you
nothing
in
which
the
police
can
have
any
interest
i
suppose
the
next
thing
they
propose
will
be
to
search
me
i
deeply
regret
to
say
that
will
be
the
next
thing
mademoiselle
unless
satisfaction
is
given
to
me
returned
the
commissary
of
police
maxine
threw
back
her
thick
veil
and
if
this
were
the
first
time
these
men
had
ever
seen
the
celebrated
actress
off
the
stage
it
seemed
to
me
that
her
beauty
must
almost
have
dazzled
them
thus
suddenly
displayed
for
maxine
is
a
gloriously
handsome
woman
and
never
had
she
been
most
striking
more
wonderful
than
at
that
moment
when
her
dark
eyes
laughed
out
of
her
white
face
and
her
red
lips
smiled
as
if
neither
they
nor
the
great
eyes
had
any
secret
to
hide
look
at
me
she
said
throwing
back
her
arms
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
forward
her
slender
body
in
the
tight
black
sheath
of
the
dress
which
was
of
the
fashion
which
i
think
women
call
princess
it
fitted
her
as
smoothly
as
the
gloves
that
covered
her
arms
to
the
elbows
do
you
think
there
is
much
chance
for
concealment
in
this
dress
she
asked
i
have
a
pocket
you
see
no
woman
could
have
in
a
gown
like
this
i
do
know
in
the
least
what
sort
of
my
old
friend
is
supposed
to
have
brought
me
is
it
large
or
small
take
off
my
gloves
and
let
you
see
my
rings
if
you
like
monsieur
le
commisaire
for
i
been
taught
as
a
servant
of
the
public
to
be
civil
to
my
fellow
servants
even
if
they
should
be
unreasonable
no
you
do
want
to
see
my
rings
let
me
oblige
you
by
taking
off
my
hat
then
i
might
have
put
the
thing
whatever
it
is
in
my
hair
as
she
spoke
she
drew
out
her
hatpins
still
laughing
in
a
half
scornful
half
way
she
was
bewitching
as
she
stood
smiling
with
her
black
hat
and
veil
in
her
hand
the
ruffled
waves
of
her
dark
red
hair
shadowing
her
forehead
meanwhile
fired
by
her
example
i
turned
out
the
contents
of
my
pockets
a
letter
or
two
a
flat
gold
cigarette
case
a
match
box
my
watch
and
a
handkerchief
also
in
an
outer
pocket
of
my
coat
a
small
bit
of
crumpled
paper
of
which
i
had
no
recollection
but
as
one
of
the
gendarmes
politely
picked
it
up
from
the
floor
where
it
had
fallen
and
handed
it
to
me
without
examining
it
mechanically
i
slipped
it
back
into
the
pocket
and
thought
no
more
of
it
at
the
time
there
were
too
many
other
things
to
think
of
and
i
was
wondering
what
on
earth
maxine
could
have
done
with
the
she
had
had
no
more
than
two
seconds
in
which
to
dispose
of
it
hardly
enough
it
seemed
to
me
to
pass
it
from
one
hand
to
another
yet
apparently
it
was
well
hidden
now
are
you
satisfied
she
asked
now
that
we
have
both
shown
you
we
have
nothing
to
conceal
or
would
you
like
to
take
me
to
the
police
station
and
have
some
dreadful
female
search
me
more
thoroughly
still
i
go
with
you
if
you
wish
i
wo
even
he
indiscreet
enough
to
ask
questions
since
you
seem
inclined
to
do
what
we
no
need
to
do
keep
your
own
secrets
all
i
stipulate
is
that
if
you
care
to
take
such
measures
you
take
them
at
once
for
as
you
may
possibly
be
aware
this
is
the
first
night
of
my
new
play
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
be
late
the
commissary
of
police
looked
fixedly
at
maxine
for
a
moment
as
if
he
would
read
her
soul
no
mademoiselle
he
said
i
am
convinced
that
neither
you
nor
monsieur
are
concealing
anything
about
your
persons
i
will
not
trouble
you
further
until
we
have
searched
the
room
maxine
could
not
blanch
for
already
she
was
as
white
as
she
will
be
when
she
lies
in
her
coffin
but
though
her
expression
did
not
change
i
saw
that
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
dilated
actress
that
she
is
she
could
control
her
muscles
but
she
could
not
control
the
beating
of
the
blood
in
her
brain
i
felt
that
she
was
conscious
of
this
betrayal
under
the
gaze
of
the
policeman
and
she
laughed
to
distract
his
attention
my
heart
ached
for
her
i
thought
of
a
manoeuvering
to
hide
the
place
where
her
nest
lies
poor
beautiful
maxine
in
spite
of
her
pride
her
high
courage
the
veneer
of
hardness
which
her
experience
of
the
world
had
given
she
was
infinitely
pathetic
in
my
eyes
and
though
i
had
never
loved
her
though
i
did
love
another
woman
i
would
have
given
my
life
gladly
at
this
minute
if
i
could
have
saved
her
from
the
catastrophe
she
dreaded
chapter
v
ivor
does
what
he
can
for
maxine
how
long
a
time
do
you
think
i
had
been
in
this
room
monsieur
she
asked
before
you
rather
rudely
i
must
say
broke
in
upon
my
conversation
with
my
friend
you
had
been
here
exactly
three
minutes
replied
the
commissary
of
police
as
much
as
that
i
should
have
thought
less
we
had
to
greet
each
other
after
having
been
parted
for
many
months
and
still
in
the
three
minutes
you
believe
that
we
had
time
to
concoct
a
plot
of
some
sort
and
to
find
some
safe
corner
all
the
while
in
for
the
hiding
of
a
thing
important
to
the
police
a
bomb
perhaps
you
must
think
us
very
clever
i
know
that
you
are
very
clever
mademoiselle
perhaps
i
ought
to
thank
you
for
the
compliment
she
answered
allowing
anger
to
warm
her
voice
at
last
but
this
is
almost
beyond
a
joke
a
woman
comes
to
the
rooms
of
a
friend
both
of
them
are
so
placed
that
they
prefer
her
call
not
to
be
talked
about
for
that
reason
and
for
the
woman
sake
the
friend
chooses
to
take
a
name
that
his
as
he
has
a
right
to
do
yet
just
because
that
woman
happens
unfortunately
to
be
her
face
and
name
being
public
property
she
is
followed
she
is
spied
upon
humiliated
and
all
no
doubt
on
account
of
some
silly
mistake
or
malicious
false
information
ah
it
is
shameful
monsieur
i
wonder
the
police
of
paris
can
stoop
to
such
stupidity
such
meanness
when
we
have
found
out
that
it
is
a
mistake
the
police
of
paris
will
apologise
to
you
mademoiselle
through
me
said
the
commissary
until
then
i
regret
if
our
duty
makes
us
disagreeable
to
you
then
turning
to
his
two
gendarmes
he
directed
them
to
search
the
room
beginning
with
all
possible
places
in
which
a
paper
parcel
or
large
envelope
might
be
hidden
within
ten
metres
of
the
spot
where
mademoiselle
and
monsieur
had
stood
talking
together
when
the
police
opened
the
door
maxine
did
not
protest
again
with
her
head
up
and
a
look
as
if
the
three
policemen
were
of
no
more
importance
to
her
than
the
furniture
of
the
room
she
walked
to
the
mantelpiece
and
stood
leaning
her
elbow
upon
it
weariness
disgusted
indifference
were
in
her
attitude
but
i
guessed
that
she
felt
herself
actually
in
need
of
the
physical
support
the
two
gendarmes
moved
about
in
noiseless
obedience
their
faces
expressionless
as
masks
they
did
not
glance
at
maxine
giving
themselves
entirely
to
the
task
at
which
they
had
been
set
but
their
superior
officer
did
not
once
take
his
eyes
from
the
pure
profile
she
turned
scornfully
towards
him
i
knew
why
he
watched
her
thus
and
thought
of
a
foolish
child
game
i
used
to
play
twenty
years
ago
at
parties
the
game
of
while
one
searched
for
the
treasure
those
who
knew
where
it
was
stood
by
saying
now
you
are
warm
now
you
are
hot
boiling
hot
now
you
are
cool
again
now
you
are
ice
cold
it
was
as
if
we
were
five
players
at
this
game
and
maxine
de
renzie
white
deathly
smiling
face
was
expected
to
proclaim
against
her
will
now
you
are
warm
now
you
are
hot
now
you
are
ice
cold
there
was
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
one
or
two
volumes
of
photographs
and
guide
books
of
paris
upon
it
as
well
as
my
hat
and
gloves
which
i
had
tossed
down
as
i
came
in
the
gendarmes
picked
up
these
things
examined
them
laid
them
aside
peered
under
the
table
peeped
behind
the
silk
cushions
on
the
sofa
opened
the
doors
and
drawers
of
a
cabinet
and
a
small
writing
desk
lifted
the
corners
of
the
rugs
on
the
bare
polished
floor
and
finally
bowing
apologies
to
maxine
for
disturbing
her
took
out
the
logs
from
the
fireplace
where
the
fire
was
ready
for
lighting
and
pried
into
the
vases
on
the
mantel
also
they
shook
the
silk
and
lace
window
curtains
and
moved
the
pictures
on
the
walls
when
all
this
had
been
done
in
vain
the
pair
confessed
with
shrugs
of
the
shoulders
that
they
were
at
a
loss
during
the
search
which
had
been
conducted
in
silence
i
had
a
curious
sensation
caused
by
my
intense
sympathy
with
maxine
suffering
i
felt
as
if
my
heart
were
the
pendulum
of
a
clock
which
had
been
jarred
until
it
was
uncertain
whether
to
go
on
or
stop
once
when
the
gendarmes
were
peering
under
the
sofa
or
behind
the
sofa
cushions
a
grey
shadow
round
maxine
eyes
made
her
beautiful
face
look
like
a
in
the
white
electric
light
which
did
not
fail
now
or
spare
her
any
cruelty
of
revelation
she
was
smiling
contemptuously
still
always
the
same
smile
but
her
forehead
appeared
to
have
been
sprinkled
with
diamond
dust
i
saw
that
dewy
sparkle
and
wondered
sickeningly
if
the
enemy
saw
it
too
but
i
had
not
long
to
wait
before
being
satisfied
on
this
point
the
frenchman
gave
no
further
instructions
to
his
baffled
subordinates
but
crossing
the
room
to
the
sofa
stood
staring
at
it
fixedly
then
grasping
the
back
with
his
hand
instead
of
beginning
at
once
a
quest
which
his
gendarmes
had
abandoned
he
searched
the
face
of
the
tortured
woman
unflinching
in
courage
she
seemed
not
to
see
him
but
it
was
as
if
she
had
suddenly
ceased
to
breathe
her
bosom
no
longer
rose
and
fell
the
only
movement
was
the
visible
knocking
of
her
heart
i
felt
that
in
another
moment
if
he
found
what
she
had
hidden
her
heart
would
knock
no
longer
and
she
would
die
for
a
second
i
wildly
counted
the
chances
of
overpowering
all
three
men
stunning
them
into
unconsciousness
and
giving
maxine
time
to
escape
with
the
but
i
knew
the
attempt
would
be
useless
even
if
i
could
succeed
the
noise
would
arouse
the
hotel
people
would
come
other
policemen
would
rush
in
to
the
help
of
their
comrades
and
matters
would
be
worse
with
us
than
before
the
frenchman
having
looked
at
maxine
and
seen
that
beating
of
her
bodice
deliberately
laid
the
silk
cushions
on
the
floor
then
pushing
his
hand
down
between
the
seat
and
the
back
of
the
sofa
he
moved
it
along
the
crevice
inch
by
inch
i
watched
the
hand
which
looked
cruel
to
me
as
that
of
an
executioner
i
think
maxine
watched
it
too
suddenly
it
stopped
it
had
found
something
the
other
hand
sprang
to
its
assistance
both
worked
together
groping
and
prying
for
a
few
seconds
evidently
the
something
hidden
had
been
forced
deeply
and
firmly
down
then
up
it
came
a
dark
red
leather
case
which
was
neither
a
nor
a
but
might
be
used
for
either
my
heart
almost
stopped
beating
in
the
intense
relief
i
felt
for
this
was
not
the
thing
i
had
come
from
london
to
bring
maxine
i
could
hardly
keep
back
a
cry
of
joy
but
i
did
keep
it
back
for
suspense
and
anxiety
had
left
me
a
few
grains
of
sense
voila
grunted
the
commissary
of
police
i
said
that
you
were
clever
mademoiselle
but
it
would
have
been
as
well
for
all
concerned
if
you
had
spared
us
this
trouble
you
alone
are
to
blame
for
the
trouble
answered
maxine
i
never
saw
that
thing
before
in
my
life
i
was
astonished
that
there
was
no
ring
of
satisfaction
in
her
voice
it
sounded
hard
and
defiant
but
there
was
no
triumph
in
it
no
joy
that
so
far
she
was
saved
as
if
by
a
miracle
rather
was
her
tone
that
of
a
woman
at
bay
fighting
to
the
last
but
without
hope
nor
did
i
ever
see
it
before
i
echoed
her
words
she
glanced
at
me
as
if
with
gratitude
yet
there
was
no
need
for
gratitude
i
was
not
lying
for
her
sake
but
speaking
the
plain
truth
as
i
thought
that
she
must
know
for
the
first
time
the
commissary
of
police
condescended
to
laugh
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
believe
that
the
last
occupant
of
this
room
tucked
some
valued
possession
down
into
a
safe
hiding
place
and
then
forgot
all
about
it
that
is
likely
is
it
not
you
shall
have
the
pleasure
mademoiselle
and
you
monsieur
of
seeing
with
me
what
that
careless
person
left
behind
him
he
had
laid
the
thing
on
the
table
and
now
he
tapped
it
aggravatingly
with
his
hand
but
the
strain
was
over
for
me
i
looked
on
with
calmness
and
was
amazed
when
at
last
maxine
flew
to
him
no
longer
scornful
tragically
indifferent
in
her
manner
but
imploring
a
weak
agonized
woman
for
the
love
of
god
spare
me
monsieur
she
sobbed
you
understand
i
confess
that
what
you
have
there
is
mine
i
have
held
myself
high
in
my
own
eyes
and
the
eyes
of
the
world
because
i
an
actress
never
took
a
lover
but
now
i
am
like
the
others
this
is
my
lover
there
the
price
i
put
on
my
love
now
monsieur
i
ask
you
on
my
womanhood
to
hold
what
is
in
that
leather
case
sacred
i
felt
the
blood
rush
to
my
face
as
if
she
had
struck
me
across
it
with
a
whip
my
first
thought
to
my
shame
was
a
selfish
one
what
if
this
became
known
this
thing
that
she
had
said
and
diana
should
hear
then
indeed
all
hope
for
me
with
the
girl
i
loved
would
be
over
my
second
thought
was
for
maxine
herself
but
she
had
sealed
my
lips
since
she
had
chosen
the
way
i
could
only
be
silent
mademoiselle
it
is
a
grief
to
me
that
i
must
refuse
such
a
prayer
from
such
a
woman
but
duty
before
chivalry
i
must
see
the
contents
of
that
case
said
the
commissary
of
police
she
caught
his
hand
and
rained
tears
upon
it
no
no
she
implored
if
i
were
rich
i
would
offer
you
thousands
to
spare
me
i
been
extravagant
i
have
saved
but
all
i
have
in
the
world
is
yours
if
there
can
be
no
such
mademoiselle
the
man
broke
in
and
wrenching
his
hand
free
he
opened
the
case
before
she
could
again
prevent
him
out
fell
a
cascade
of
light
a
diamond
necklace
it
flashed
to
the
floor
where
it
lay
on
one
of
the
sofa
cushions
sending
up
a
spray
of
rainbow
colours
sacré
bleu
muttered
the
frenchman
under
his
breath
for
whatever
he
had
expected
he
had
not
expected
that
but
maxine
spoke
not
a
word
shorn
of
hope
as
in
spite
of
her
prayers
and
tears
the
leather
case
was
torn
open
she
was
shorn
of
strength
as
well
and
the
beautiful
tall
figure
crumpling
like
a
flower
broken
on
its
stalk
she
would
have
fallen
if
i
had
not
caught
her
holding
her
up
against
my
shoulder
when
the
cataract
of
diamonds
sprang
out
of
the
case
however
i
felt
her
limp
body
straighten
itself
i
felt
her
pulses
leap
i
felt
her
begin
to
she
had
drunk
a
draught
of
hope
and
life
and
fortified
by
it
was
gathering
all
her
scattered
forces
together
for
a
new
fight
if
fight
she
must
again
the
commissary
of
police
turned
the
leather
case
wrong
side
out
it
was
empty
there
had
been
nothing
inside
but
the
necklace
not
a
card
not
a
scrap
of
paper
where
then
is
the
document
crestfallen
he
put
the
question
half
to
himself
half
to
maxine
de
renzie
what
document
she
asked
too
wise
to
betray
relief
in
voice
or
face
hearing
the
heavy
tone
seeing
the
shamed
face
the
hanging
head
that
lay
against
my
shoulder
who
knowing
a
little
less
than
i
did
of
the
truth
would
have
dreamed
that
in
her
soul
she
thanked
god
for
a
miracle
even
i
would
not
have
been
sure
had
i
not
felt
the
life
stealing
back
into
her
body
the
contents
of
the
case
are
not
what
i
came
here
to
find
admitted
the
enemy
i
do
not
know
what
you
came
to
find
but
you
have
made
me
suffer
horribly
said
maxine
you
have
been
very
cruel
to
a
woman
who
has
done
nothing
to
deserve
such
humiliation
all
pleasure
i
might
have
taken
in
my
diamonds
is
gone
now
i
shall
never
have
a
peaceful
moment
never
be
able
to
wear
them
joyfully
i
shall
have
the
thought
in
my
mind
that
people
who
look
at
me
will
be
saying
woman
has
her
price
there
is
the
price
of
maxine
de
renzie
you
need
have
no
such
thought
mademoiselle
the
man
protested
we
shall
never
speak
to
anyone
except
those
who
will
receive
our
report
of
what
we
have
heard
and
seen
in
this
room
wo
you
search
further
asked
maxine
since
you
seemed
to
expect
something
else
you
would
not
have
had
time
to
conceal
more
than
one
thing
mademoiselle
said
the
policeman
with
a
smile
that
was
faintly
grim
besides
this
case
was
what
you
did
not
wish
us
to
find
you
are
a
great
actress
but
you
could
not
control
the
dew
which
sprang
out
on
your
forehead
or
the
beating
of
your
heart
when
i
touched
the
sofa
so
i
knew
i
had
been
watching
you
for
that
there
has
been
an
error
and
i
can
only
apologise
i
do
blame
you
but
those
who
sent
you
said
maxine
letting
me
lead
her
to
a
chair
into
which
she
sank
limply
i
am
thankful
you
do
not
tell
me
these
diamonds
are
contraband
in
some
way
i
was
not
sure
but
it
would
end
in
that
not
at
all
mademoiselle
i
wish
you
joy
of
them
it
is
you
who
will
adorn
the
jewels
not
they
you
again
i
apologise
for
myself
and
my
companions
we
have
but
done
our
duty
i
have
an
enemy
who
must
have
contrived
this
plot
against
me
exclaimed
maxine
as
if
on
a
sudden
thought
it
is
said
that
hath
no
fury
like
a
woman
scorned
but
what
of
a
man
who
has
been
scorned
by
a
woman
he
knew
i
wanted
all
my
strength
for
the
night
of
the
new
play
and
he
will
be
hoping
that
this
has
broken
me
but
i
will
not
be
broken
if
you
would
atone
messieurs
for
your
part
in
this
scene
you
will
go
to
the
theatre
this
evening
and
encourage
me
by
your
applause
all
three
bowed
the
commissary
of
police
lately
so
relentless
murmured
compliments
it
was
all
very
french
and
after
what
had
passed
gave
me
the
sensation
that
i
was
in
a
dream
chapter
vi
ivor
hears
the
story
they
were
gone
they
had
closed
the
door
behind
them
i
looked
at
maxine
but
she
did
not
speak
with
her
finger
to
her
lips
she
got
up
trembling
still
and
walking
to
the
door
she
opened
it
suddenly
to
look
out
nobody
was
there
they
may
have
gone
into
your
bedroom
to
listen
at
that
door
she
whispered
i
took
the
hint
and
going
quickly
into
the
room
adjoining
turned
on
the
light
emptiness
there
but
i
left
the
door
open
and
the
electricity
switched
on
they
might
change
their
minds
or
be
more
subtle
than
they
wished
to
seem
maxine
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
gathering
up
the
necklace
from
the
cushion
where
it
had
fallen
and
lifting
it
in
both
hands
pressed
the
glittering
mass
against
her
lips
and
cheeks
thank
god
thank
god
and
thank
you
ivor
best
of
friends
she
said
brokenly
in
so
low
a
voice
that
no
ear
could
have
caught
her
words
even
if
pressed
against
the
keyhole
then
letting
the
diamonds
drop
into
her
lap
she
flung
back
her
head
and
laughed
and
cried
together
oh
ivor
ivor
she
panted
between
her
sobs
and
hysterical
gusts
of
laughter
the
agony
of
it
the
agony
and
the
joy
now
wonderful
good
precious
ivor
dear
friend
saint
at
this
i
laughed
too
partly
to
calm
her
and
patted
gently
the
hands
with
which
she
had
nervously
clutched
my
sleeve
heaven
knows
i
do
deserve
one
of
those
epithets
i
said
i
just
stick
to
friend
not
deserve
them
she
repeated
not
deserve
them
when
you
saved
me
i
do
yet
understand
how
from
a
horror
worse
than
death
oh
but
a
thousand
times
worse
for
i
wanted
to
die
i
meant
to
die
if
they
had
found
it
i
should
have
lived
to
see
morning
tell
me
how
did
you
work
such
a
miracle
how
did
you
get
this
necklace
that
meant
so
much
to
me
and
to
one
i
love
and
how
did
you
hide
the
other
thing
i
do
know
anything
about
this
necklace
i
answered
stupidly
i
did
bring
it
you
bring
no
at
least
that
red
leather
thing
is
the
case
i
carried
when
the
fellow
pulled
it
out
from
the
sofa
i
saw
it
was
what
i
had
so
i
thanked
our
lucky
stars
and
would
have
tried
to
let
you
know
that
all
hope
was
over
if
i
dared
to
catch
your
eye
or
make
a
signal
maxine
was
suddenly
calm
the
tears
had
dried
on
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
ivor
you
ca
know
what
you
are
talking
about
she
said
in
a
changed
voice
that
red
leather
case
is
what
you
took
out
of
your
breast
pocket
and
handed
to
me
when
i
first
came
into
the
room
at
the
sound
of
the
knock
i
pushed
it
down
as
far
as
i
could
between
the
seat
and
back
of
the
sofa
and
then
ran
off
to
a
distance
before
the
door
opened
you
bring
the
necklace
knowingly
or
not
and
as
it
was
the
cause
of
all
my
trouble
in
the
beginning
i
need
tell
you
of
the
joy
i
had
in
seeing
it
apart
from
the
heavenly
relief
of
being
spared
discovery
of
the
thing
i
feared
now
when
you
given
me
the
other
packet
which
you
hid
so
marvellously
i
can
go
away
happy
i
stared
at
her
feeling
more
than
ever
like
one
in
a
dream
i
gave
you
the
only
thing
i
brought
i
said
it
was
in
my
breast
pocket
inside
my
coat
i
took
it
out
and
put
it
in
your
hands
there
was
no
other
thing
look
again
in
the
sofa
it
must
be
there
still
this
red
case
is
something
else
we
can
try
to
account
for
it
later
it
all
came
through
the
lights
not
working
if
it
had
been
dusk
you
would
have
seen
that
i
gave
you
a
dark
green
leather
quite
different
from
this
though
of
about
the
same
length
rather
less
thick
and
frantically
she
began
ransacking
the
crevice
between
the
seat
and
back
of
the
sofa
but
nothing
was
there
we
might
have
known
there
could
be
nothing
or
the
commissary
of
police
would
have
been
before
us
with
a
cry
she
cut
me
short
at
last
throwing
up
her
hands
in
despair
she
was
deathly
pale
again
and
all
the
light
had
gone
out
of
her
eyes
leaving
them
dull
as
if
she
had
been
sick
with
some
long
illness
what
will
become
of
me
she
stammered
the
treaty
lost
my
god
what
shall
i
do
ivor
you
are
killing
me
do
you
know
you
are
killing
me
the
word
treaty
was
new
to
me
in
this
connection
for
the
foreign
secretary
had
not
thought
it
necessary
that
his
messenger
should
be
wholly
in
his
secrets
and
maxine
yet
hearing
the
word
brought
no
great
surprise
i
knew
that
i
had
been
in
some
game
of
high
stakes
but
it
was
of
maxine
i
thought
now
and
the
importance
of
the
loss
to
her
not
the
national
disaster
which
it
might
well
be
also
wait
i
said
do
despair
yet
there
some
mistake
perhaps
we
shall
be
able
to
see
light
when
we
thrashed
this
out
and
talked
it
over
i
know
i
had
a
green
it
never
left
my
pocket
i
thought
of
it
and
guarded
it
every
moment
could
those
diamonds
have
been
inside
it
could
the
foreign
secretary
had
given
me
the
necklace
of
what
you
expected
no
no
she
answered
with
desperate
impatience
he
knew
that
the
only
thing
which
could
save
me
was
the
document
i
sent
him
i
wired
that
i
must
have
it
back
again
immediately
for
my
own
sake
for
his
for
the
sake
of
england
ivor
think
again
do
you
want
me
to
go
mad
i
will
think
i
said
trying
to
speak
reassuringly
give
me
a
moment
a
quiet
moment
a
quiet
moment
she
repeated
bitterly
when
for
me
each
second
is
an
hour
it
late
and
this
is
the
night
of
my
new
play
soon
i
must
be
at
the
theatre
for
the
and
dressing
of
this
part
for
the
first
act
are
a
heavy
business
i
do
want
all
paris
to
know
that
maxine
de
renzie
has
been
ruined
by
her
enemies
let
us
keep
the
secret
while
we
can
for
others
sakes
and
so
gain
time
for
our
own
if
all
is
not
lost
if
you
believe
still
that
there
any
hope
oh
save
me
ivor
somehow
my
whole
life
is
in
this
let
your
understudy
take
your
part
while
we
think
and
work
i
suggested
you
can
not
go
to
the
theatre
in
this
state
for
an
actress
there
no
such
word
as
can
not
she
said
bitterly
i
could
play
a
part
to
the
finish
and
crawl
off
the
stage
to
die
the
next
instant
yet
no
one
would
have
guessed
that
i
was
dying
i
have
no
understudy
what
use
to
have
one
what
audience
would
stop
in
the
theatre
after
an
announcement
that
their
maxine
understudy
would
take
her
place
every
man
and
woman
would
walk
out
and
get
his
money
back
no
for
the
sake
of
the
man
i
love
better
than
my
life
or
twenty
lives
the
man
i
either
saved
or
ruined
i
play
tonight
if
i
go
mad
or
kill
myself
do
quietly
ivor
think
out
aloud
and
let
me
follow
the
workings
of
your
mind
we
may
help
each
other
so
let
us
go
over
together
everything
that
happened
to
you
from
the
minute
you
took
the
from
the
foreign
secretary
up
to
the
minute
i
came
into
this
room
i
obeyed
beginning
at
the
very
beginning
and
telling
her
all
except
the
part
that
had
to
do
with
diana
forrest
she
had
no
concern
in
that
i
told
her
how
i
had
slept
with
the
green
under
my
pillow
and
had
waked
to
feel
and
look
for
it
once
or
twice
an
hour
how
when
morning
came
i
had
been
late
in
getting
to
the
train
how
i
had
struggled
with
the
two
men
who
tried
to
keep
me
out
of
the
reserved
compartment
into
which
they
were
intruding
how
the
man
who
had
a
right
to
it
after
wishing
to
prevent
my
entering
helped
me
in
the
end
rather
than
be
alone
with
the
pair
who
had
forced
themselves
upon
him
how
he
had
stumbled
almost
into
my
arms
in
a
panic
during
the
confusion
after
the
false
alarm
on
the
boat
gangway
how
he
had
walked
beside
me
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
speaking
later
in
the
gare
du
nord
how
i
had
avoided
and
lost
sight
of
him
but
how
i
had
many
times
covertly
touched
my
pocket
to
be
sure
that
through
all
the
was
still
safe
there
maxine
grew
calmer
though
not
i
think
more
hopeful
as
i
talked
and
at
last
she
folded
up
the
diamonds
neatly
in
the
red
case
which
she
gave
to
me
put
that
into
the
same
pocket
she
said
and
then
pass
your
hand
over
your
coat
as
you
did
often
before
now
does
it
feel
exactly
as
if
it
were
the
green
with
which
you
started
out
yes
i
think
it
does
i
answered
doubtfully
i
afraid
i
know
the
difference
this
be
a
little
thicker
than
the
other
but
i
ca
be
sure
and
you
see
i
never
once
had
a
chance
to
unbutton
my
coat
and
look
at
the
thing
i
had
in
this
inner
pocket
it
would
have
attracted
too
much
attention
to
risk
that
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
especially
warned
not
to
do
it
i
could
trust
only
to
the
touch
but
even
granting
that
by
a
skill
almost
clever
enough
for
sleight
of
hand
a
skill
which
only
the
smartest
pickpocket
in
europe
could
possess
why
should
a
thief
who
had
stolen
my
give
me
instead
a
string
of
diamonds
worth
many
thousands
of
pounds
if
he
wanted
to
put
something
into
my
pocket
of
much
the
same
size
and
shape
as
the
thing
he
stole
so
that
i
should
suspect
my
loss
why
he
slip
in
the
red
case
instead
of
containing
the
necklace
necklace
too
of
all
things
in
the
world
murmured
maxine
lost
in
the
mystery
it
like
a
dream
yet
here
by
some
miracle
it
is
in
our
hands
and
the
treaty
is
gone
the
treaty
is
gone
i
repeated
miserably
it
was
maxine
herself
who
had
spoken
the
words
which
i
merely
echoed
yet
it
almost
killed
her
to
hear
them
from
me
no
doubt
it
gave
the
dreadful
fact
a
kind
of
inevitability
she
flung
herself
down
on
the
sofa
with
a
groan
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
my
god
what
a
punishment
she
stammered
i
ruined
the
man
i
risked
everything
to
save
i
will
go
to
the
theatre
and
i
will
act
my
friend
but
unless
you
can
give
me
back
what
is
lost
when
morning
comes
i
shall
be
out
of
the
world
do
say
that
i
implored
sick
with
pity
for
her
and
shame
at
my
failure
all
hope
is
over
yet
it
ca
be
i
think
this
out
there
must
be
a
solution
there
must
be
a
way
of
laying
hold
of
what
to
be
gone
if
by
giving
my
life
i
could
get
it
i
assure
you
i
would
hesitate
for
an
instant
now
so
you
see
there
nothing
i
wo
do
to
help
you
only
i
wish
the
path
could
be
made
a
little
plainer
for
me
unless
for
some
reason
it
necessary
for
you
to
keep
me
in
the
dark
the
word
i
heard
for
the
first
time
from
you
i
did
know
what
i
was
bringing
you
except
that
it
was
a
document
of
international
importance
and
that
you
been
helping
the
british
foreign
secretary
perhaps
great
britain
as
a
power
in
some
ticklish
manoeuvre
of
high
politics
he
said
that
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
you
might
tell
me
more
if
you
liked
he
left
it
to
you
that
was
his
message
then
i
will
tell
you
more
maxine
exclaimed
it
will
be
better
to
do
so
i
know
that
it
will
make
it
easier
for
you
to
help
me
the
document
you
were
bringing
me
was
a
treaty
a
quite
new
treaty
between
japan
russia
and
france
not
a
copy
but
the
original
england
had
been
warned
that
there
was
a
secret
understanding
between
the
three
countries
unknown
to
her
there
was
no
time
to
make
a
copy
and
i
stole
the
real
treaty
from
raoul
du
laurier
to
whom
i
am
engaged
whom
i
adore
ivor
as
i
did
know
it
was
in
me
to
adore
any
man
you
know
his
name
perhaps
that
he
under
secretary
in
the
foreign
office
here
in
paris
oh
i
can
read
in
your
eyes
what
you
thinking
of
me
now
you
think
worse
of
me
than
i
think
of
myself
yet
i
did
the
thing
for
raoul
sake
there
that
in
my
defence
only
that
i
do
understand
i
said
trying
not
to
show
the
horror
of
treachery
to
a
man
who
loved
and
trusted
her
which
i
could
not
help
feeling
how
could
you
except
that
i
betrayed
him
but
i
tell
you
everything
i
go
back
a
long
way
then
you
pity
me
even
if
you
scorn
me
too
you
work
for
me
to
save
me
and
him
for
years
helped
the
british
government
oh
i
wo
spare
myself
i
been
a
spy
sometimes
against
one
power
sometimes
against
another
when
there
was
anything
to
do
against
russia
i
was
always
glad
because
my
dear
father
was
a
pole
and
you
know
how
poles
feel
towards
russia
russia
ruined
his
life
and
stripped
it
of
everything
worth
having
not
only
money
but
oh
well
that
not
in
this
story
of
mine
i
wo
trouble
you
or
waste
time
in
the
telling
only
when
i
was
a
very
young
girl
i
was
already
the
enemy
of
all
that
russian
with
a
big
debt
of
revenge
to
pay
and
i
been
paying
it
slowly
do
think
that
the
money
had
for
my
work
hateful
work
often
has
been
used
for
myself
it
been
for
my
father
country
poor
sad
country
every
shilling
of
english
coin
as
an
actress
i
supported
myself
and
as
an
actress
it
has
been
easier
for
me
to
do
the
other
secret
work
than
it
would
have
been
for
a
woman
leading
a
more
sheltered
life
mingling
less
with
distinguished
persons
of
different
countries
or
unable
to
be
eccentric
without
causing
scandal
as
for
france
she
the
friend
of
russia
and
i
have
a
drop
of
french
blood
in
my
veins
so
at
least
i
never
been
treacherous
to
my
own
people
oh
i
have
made
some
great
in
the
last
eight
or
nine
years
ivor
for
i
began
before
i
was
sixteen
and
now
i
once
or
twice
england
has
had
to
thank
me
for
giving
her
news
of
the
most
vital
importance
you
shocked
to
hear
what
my
inner
life
has
been
if
i
were
shocked
no
doubt
the
feeling
would
be
more
than
half
conventional
one
hardly
knows
how
conventional
one
opinions
are
until
one
stops
to
think
said
i
once
i
gloried
in
the
work
maxine
went
on
but
that
was
before
i
fell
in
love
you
and
i
have
played
a
little
at
being
in
love
but
that
was
to
pass
the
time
both
of
us
were
flirting
i
never
met
raoul
then
and
i
never
really
loved
any
man
except
him
it
came
at
first
sight
for
me
and
when
he
told
me
that
he
cared
he
said
it
had
begun
when
he
first
saw
me
on
the
stage
so
you
see
it
is
as
if
we
were
meant
for
each
other
from
the
moment
i
gave
him
my
promise
i
promised
myself
that
the
old
work
should
be
given
up
for
ever
raoul
raoul
wife
should
not
be
the
tool
of
diplomatists
besides
as
he
a
frenchman
his
wife
would
owe
loyalty
to
france
which
maxine
de
renzie
never
owed
i
wanted
oh
how
much
i
wanted
to
be
only
what
raoul
believed
me
just
a
simple
woman
with
nothing
to
hide
it
made
me
sick
to
think
that
there
was
one
thing
i
must
always
conceal
from
him
but
i
did
the
best
i
could
i
vowed
to
myself
that
i
break
with
the
past
and
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
british
foreign
secretary
who
has
always
been
a
good
friend
of
mine
i
said
i
was
engaged
and
hoped
to
begin
my
life
all
over
again
in
a
different
way
though
he
might
be
sure
that
i
know
how
to
keep
his
secrets
as
well
as
my
own
oh
ivor
to
think
that
was
hardly
more
than
a
week
ago
i
was
happy
then
i
feel
twenty
years
older
now
a
week
ago
you
been
engaged
only
a
week
i
broke
in
not
many
days
more
i
guessed
i
hoped
long
ago
that
raoul
cared
but
he
would
have
told
me
even
the
day
he
did
tell
if
he
had
lost
his
head
a
little
he
had
meant
to
speak
it
seems
for
he
poor
and
he
thought
he
had
no
right
but
what
a
man
worth
who
does
lose
his
head
when
he
loves
a
woman
i
adored
him
for
it
we
decided
not
to
let
anyone
know
until
a
few
weeks
before
we
could
marry
as
i
care
to
have
my
engagement
gossipped
about
for
months
on
end
there
were
reasons
why
more
than
one
but
the
man
of
all
others
whom
i
want
to
know
the
truth
found
out
or
rather
suspected
what
had
happened
the
very
day
when
raoul
and
i
came
to
an
understanding
count
godensky
of
the
russian
embassy
he
called
and
was
let
in
by
mistake
while
raoul
was
with
me
and
just
as
he
must
have
seen
by
our
faces
that
there
was
something
to
suspect
so
i
saw
by
his
that
he
did
suspect
oh
a
hateful
person
i
refused
him
three
times
there
are
some
men
so
vain
that
they
can
never
believe
a
woman
really
means
to
say
to
them
count
godensky
is
one
of
those
and
he
dangerous
too
i
afraid
of
him
since
i
cared
for
raoul
though
i
used
to
be
afraid
of
no
one
when
i
only
myself
to
think
of
raoul
was
going
away
that
very
night
he
had
an
errand
to
do
for
a
woman
who
was
a
dear
and
intimate
friend
of
his
dead
mother
you
must
know
of
the
duchesse
de
montpellier
well
it
was
for
her
and
raoul
is
like
her
son
she
has
no
children
of
her
own
i
do
know
her
i
said
but
i
seen
her
a
charming
looking
woman
about
with
a
husband
a
fellow
who
might
be
rather
a
tartar
to
live
with
they
were
pointed
out
to
me
at
monte
carlo
one
year
in
the
casino
where
the
duchess
seemed
to
be
enjoying
herself
hugely
though
the
duke
had
the
air
of
being
dragged
in
against
his
will
no
doubt
he
had
been
or
else
he
was
there
to
fetch
her
out
poor
dear
she
a
dreadful
gambler
it
in
her
blood
i
she
lost
i
do
know
how
much
at
monte
carlo
on
an
system
she
had
she
afraid
of
her
husband
though
she
loves
him
immensely
and
lately
a
craze
had
for
bridge
has
cost
her
so
much
that
she
dare
tell
the
duke
who
hates
her
gambling
she
confessed
to
raoul
and
begged
him
to
help
her
not
with
money
for
he
has
none
but
by
taking
a
famous
and
wonderful
diamond
necklace
of
hers
to
amsterdam
selling
the
stones
for
her
there
and
having
them
replaced
with
paste
it
was
all
to
be
done
very
secretly
of
course
so
that
the
duke
should
know
and
raoul
hated
it
but
he
could
refuse
he
had
no
idea
of
telling
me
this
story
that
day
when
he
his
head
while
we
were
bidding
each
other
before
his
journey
he
did
mention
the
name
of
the
duchess
but
said
only
that
he
had
leave
and
was
going
to
holland
on
business
but
while
he
was
away
a
thing
happened
the
most
ghastly
misfortune
and
as
we
were
engaged
to
be
married
he
felt
obliged
when
he
came
back
to
let
me
know
the
worst
what
was
the
dreadful
thing
that
happened
i
asked
as
she
paused
pressing
her
hands
against
her
temples
the
necklace
was
stolen
from
raoul
by
a
thief
who
must
have
been
one
of
the
most
expert
in
the
world
can
you
imagine
raoul
feelings
he
came
to
me
in
despair
asking
my
advice
what
was
he
to
do
he
dared
not
appeal
to
the
police
or
the
duchess
secret
would
come
out
and
he
could
bear
to
tell
her
of
the
loss
not
only
because
it
would
be
such
a
blow
to
her
as
she
was
depending
on
the
money
from
the
sale
of
the
jewels
but
because
she
knew
that
he
was
in
some
difficulties
and
be
tempted
to
believe
that
he
only
pretended
the
diamonds
were
stolen
while
really
he
sold
them
for
his
own
use
as
she
fond
of
him
and
trusts
him
probably
she
would
have
thought
no
such
thing
i
tried
to
comfort
maxine
but
certainly
it
was
a
rather
bad
fix
rather
bad
fix
oh
you
laconic
creatures
englishmen
all
you
think
of
is
to
hide
your
feelings
behind
icy
words
as
for
me
well
there
was
nothing
i
would
have
done
to
help
him
nothing
my
life
would
have
been
a
small
thing
to
give
i
would
have
given
my
soul
and
already
a
thought
came
flashing
into
my
mind
i
begged
raoul
to
wait
and
say
nothing
to
the
duchess
who
did
even
know
yet
that
he
come
back
from
amsterdam
the
thought
in
my
mind
was
about
the
commission
from
your
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
as
i
told
you
i
just
sent
him
word
in
the
usual
cypher
and
through
the
usual
channels
that
i
do
what
he
wanted
he
offered
me
eight
thousand
pounds
to
undertake
the
service
and
four
more
if
i
succeeded
i
believed
i
could
succeed
if
i
tried
and
with
the
few
thousands
i
saved
up
and
selling
such
jewels
as
i
had
i
could
make
up
the
sum
raoul
had
been
told
to
ask
for
the
necklace
then
he
could
give
it
to
the
duchess
and
she
need
never
know
that
the
diamonds
had
been
stolen
all
that
night
i
lay
awake
thinking
thinking
next
day
at
a
time
when
i
knew
raoul
would
be
working
in
his
office
i
went
to
see
him
there
and
cheered
him
up
as
well
as
i
could
i
told
him
that
in
a
few
days
i
hoped
to
have
eighteen
or
twenty
thousand
pounds
in
my
hands
all
for
him
to
let
him
have
the
money
would
make
me
happier
than
i
ever
been
at
first
he
said
he
would
take
it
from
me
i
knew
he
would
say
that
but
at
last
after
i
cried
and
begged
and
persuaded
he
consented
only
it
was
to
be
a
loan
and
some
how
some
time
he
would
pay
me
back
in
that
office
there
are
several
great
safes
and
when
we
had
grown
quite
happy
and
gay
together
i
made
raoul
tell
me
which
was
the
most
important
of
all
where
the
really
sacred
and
valuable
things
were
kept
he
laughed
and
pointed
out
the
most
interesting
one
the
one
he
said
which
held
all
the
deepest
secrets
of
french
foreign
diplomacy
i
was
sure
then
that
the
thing
i
had
to
get
for
the
british
foreign
secretary
must
be
there
though
it
was
such
a
new
thing
that
it
could
have
been
anywhere
for
long
are
three
keys
to
that
safe
said
raoul
is
kept
by
the
president
one
is
always
with
the
foreign
secretary
this
is
the
third
and
he
showed
me
a
strange
little
key
different
to
any
i
had
seen
before
do
let
me
have
a
peep
at
these
wonderful
papers
i
pleaded
with
him
before
coming
i
had
planned
what
to
do
round
my
throat
i
wore
a
string
of
imitation
pearls
which
i
put
on
for
a
special
purpose
but
they
were
pretty
and
so
well
made
that
only
an
expert
would
know
they
were
real
raoul
is
an
expert
so
at
the
moment
he
fitted
the
key
into
the
lock
of
the
safe
to
open
the
door
i
gave
a
sly
little
pull
and
broke
the
thread
making
the
pearls
roll
everywhere
about
the
floor
he
was
quite
distressed
forgot
all
about
the
key
in
the
lock
and
flew
to
pick
up
the
pearls
as
if
each
one
were
worth
at
least
a
thousand
francs
while
he
was
busy
finding
the
lost
beads
i
whipped
out
the
key
took
an
impression
of
it
on
a
piece
of
wax
i
had
ready
concealed
in
my
handkerchief
and
slipped
it
back
into
the
lock
while
he
was
still
on
his
hands
and
knees
on
the
floor
then
he
opened
the
for
a
moment
just
to
give
me
the
peep
i
had
begged
for
but
not
long
enough
for
me
to
touch
anything
even
if
i
dared
to
try
with
him
standing
there
enough
though
to
show
me
that
the
documents
were
neatly
arranged
in
labelled
and
to
see
their
general
character
colour
and
shape
that
same
day
a
key
to
fit
the
lock
was
being
made
and
when
it
was
ready
i
made
an
excuse
to
call
again
on
raoul
at
the
office
not
that
a
very
elaborate
excuse
was
needed
the
poor
fellow
trusting
me
as
he
trusts
himself
or
more
was
only
too
glad
to
have
me
come
to
him
even
in
that
sacred
place
now
the
thing
was
to
get
him
away
but
i
made
up
my
mind
what
to
do
in
another
office
upstairs
was
a
friend
of
raoul
the
one
who
introduced
us
to
each
other
and
i
made
up
a
message
for
him
which
i
begged
raoul
to
take
and
bring
his
friend
to
speak
to
me
he
went
and
i
believed
i
might
count
on
five
minutes
to
myself
no
more
but
those
five
minutes
would
have
to
be
enough
for
success
or
failure
the
instant
the
door
shut
behind
raoul
i
was
at
the
safe
the
key
fitted
i
snatched
out
a
folded
document
and
opened
it
to
make
quite
quite
certain
it
was
the
right
one
for
a
mistake
would
be
inexcusable
and
spoil
everything
it
was
what
i
wanted
the
treaty
newly
made
between
japan
russia
and
france
the
treaty
which
your
foreign
secretary
thought
he
had
reason
to
believe
was
a
secret
one
arranged
between
the
three
countries
without
the
knowledge
of
england
and
to
the
prejudice
of
her
interests
the
one
glance
i
had
gave
me
the
impression
that
the
document
was
nothing
of
the
kind
but
quite
innocent
affecting
trade
only
yet
that
was
my
business
i
had
to
send
it
to
the
foreign
secretary
who
wanted
to
know
its
precise
nature
and
whether
england
was
being
deceived
in
place
of
the
treaty
i
slipped
into
its
a
document
i
brought
with
me
just
like
the
real
thing
no
one
opening
the
safe
on
other
business
would
suspect
the
change
that
had
been
made
my
hope
was
to
get
the
treaty
back
before
it
should
be
missed
you
see
i
was
betraying
raoul
to
save
him
do
you
understand
i
understand
you
must
have
persuaded
yourself
that
you
were
justified
but
good
heavens
maxine
i
could
help
breaking
out
it
was
an
awful
thing
to
do
i
know
i
know
but
i
had
to
have
the
money
for
raoul
and
there
was
no
other
way
to
get
it
you
remember
i
refused
till
the
diamonds
were
lost
and
would
have
refused
even
if
raoul
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
french
foreign
office
but
let
me
go
on
telling
you
what
happened
i
had
time
enough
i
had
even
a
minute
or
two
to
spare
and
fortunately
for
me
the
man
i
sent
raoul
to
find
was
out
i
looked
at
my
watch
pretended
to
be
surprised
and
said
i
must
go
at
once
i
could
bear
to
waste
a
second
in
hurrying
the
treaty
off
so
that
it
might
the
more
quickly
be
on
its
way
back
i
had
come
to
visit
raoul
in
my
own
carriage
but
in
a
cab
which
was
waiting
as
raoul
was
taking
me
to
it
count
godensky
got
out
of
a
and
saw
me
if
only
it
had
been
anywhere
except
in
front
of
the
foreign
office
i
told
myself
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
guess
that
anything
was
wrong
but
i
was
in
such
a
state
of
nerves
that
as
he
raised
his
hat
and
his
eyebrows
i
fancied
that
he
imagined
all
sorts
of
things
and
i
felt
myself
grow
red
and
pale
what
a
fool
i
was
and
how
weak
but
i
could
help
it
i
did
wait
to
go
home
i
wrote
a
few
lines
in
the
cab
and
sent
off
the
packet
registered
in
time
i
hoped
to
catch
the
post
but
after
all
it
did
coming
out
from
the
post
office
there
was
godensky
again
in
his
could
have
been
no
coincidence
a
horrid
certainty
sprang
to
life
in
me
that
he
followed
my
cab
from
the
foreign
office
to
see
where
i
would
go
why
could
i
have
thought
of
that
danger
i
have
always
thought
of
things
and
guarded
against
them
yet
this
time
this
time
of
all
others
i
seemed
fated
but
if
godensky
had
known
what
you
were
doing
the
game
would
have
been
up
for
you
before
this
i
said
he
did
know
of
course
only
if
he
wants
to
be
a
woman
lover
and
she
wo
have
him
he
her
enemy
and
he
the
enemy
of
the
man
who
her
lover
he
too
clever
and
too
careful
of
his
own
interests
to
speak
out
prematurely
anything
he
might
vaguely
suspect
for
it
would
do
him
harm
if
he
proved
mistaken
he
would
yet
i
think
even
warn
those
whom
it
might
concern
to
search
and
see
if
anything
in
charge
were
out
of
order
or
missing
but
what
he
would
do
what
i
think
he
has
done
is
this
having
some
idea
as
he
may
have
that
my
relations
with
certain
important
persons
in
england
are
rather
friendly
and
seeing
me
come
from
the
foreign
office
to
go
almost
straight
to
the
post
it
might
have
occurred
to
him
to
try
and
learn
the
name
of
my
correspondent
he
has
influence
he
could
perhaps
have
found
out
but
if
he
did
it
would
have
helped
him
much
for
naturally
my
dealings
with
the
british
foreign
secretary
are
always
well
under
cover
hence
a
delay
sometimes
in
his
receiving
word
from
me
what
i
send
can
never
go
straight
to
him
as
you
may
guess
godensky
would
guess
that
too
and
he
would
have
perhaps
informed
the
police
very
cautiously
very
unofficially
and
confidentially
that
he
suspected
maxine
de
renzie
of
being
a
political
spy
in
the
pay
of
england
he
would
have
advised
that
my
movements
be
watched
for
the
next
few
days
that
english
agents
of
the
french
police
be
warned
to
watch
also
on
their
side
of
the
channel
he
would
have
argued
to
himself
that
if
i
sent
any
document
away
with
raoul
connivance
or
without
i
would
be
wanting
it
back
as
soon
as
possible
and
he
would
have
mentioned
to
the
police
that
possibly
a
messenger
would
bring
me
something
if
my
correspondence
through
the
post
was
found
to
contain
nothing
compromising
oh
there
have
been
eyes
on
me
and
on
every
movement
of
mine
i
sure
see
how
efficient
though
quiet
the
methods
have
been
where
you
concerned
they
the
police
knew
the
name
of
the
man
i
was
to
meet
here
at
this
hotel
and
if
as
godensky
must
have
hoped
any
document
belonging
to
the
french
government
had
been
found
on
you
or
me
everything
would
have
played
into
his
hands
raoul
would
have
been
ruined
his
heart
broken
and
i
but
there
are
no
words
to
express
what
i
would
have
suffered
what
i
may
yet
have
to
suffer
godensky
would
be
praised
for
his
cleverness
as
well
as
securing
a
satisfactory
revenge
on
me
for
refusing
him
the
only
thing
which
rejoices
me
now
is
the
thought
of
his
blank
disappointment
when
he
gets
the
news
from
the
commissary
of
police
you
do
believe
then
i
asked
that
godensky
has
had
any
hand
in
the
disappearance
of
the
treaty
i
would
believe
it
if
it
were
for
the
necklace
being
put
in
its
place
even
if
count
godensky
could
have
known
of
raoul
mission
with
the
diamonds
and
got
them
into
his
own
hands
he
would
have
let
them
get
out
again
with
every
chance
of
their
going
back
to
raoul
and
thus
saving
him
from
his
trouble
he
do
nothing
to
help
but
everything
to
hinder
there
lies
the
mystery
in
the
return
of
the
necklace
instead
of
the
treaty
you
have
no
knowledge
of
it
you
tell
me
yet
you
come
to
me
with
it
in
your
pocket
the
necklace
stolen
from
raoul
du
laurier
days
ago
in
amsterdam
or
on
the
way
there
you
certain
it
the
same
certain
as
that
you
are
you
and
i
am
i
and
i
not
out
of
my
mind
yet
though
i
soon
shall
be
unless
you
somehow
save
me
from
this
horror
i
going
to
try
i
said
do
give
up
hope
i
wish
though
that
you
had
to
act
so
do
i
but
there
no
way
out
of
it
and
i
must
go
now
to
the
theatre
or
i
shall
be
late
my
a
heavy
one
and
takes
a
long
time
i
ca
afford
to
have
any
talk
about
me
and
my
affairs
whatever
comes
afterwards
raoul
will
be
in
a
box
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
he
be
at
the
door
of
my
the
agony
of
seeing
him
of
hearing
him
praise
my
acting
and
saying
dear
trusting
loving
words
that
would
make
me
almost
too
happy
if
i
had
betrayed
him
ruined
his
career
for
ever
maybe
not
i
said
and
anyhow
there
the
necklace
something
yes
that
something
will
godensky
be
in
the
audience
too
i
asked
i
sure
he
will
he
could
keep
away
but
he
may
be
late
he
come
until
he
had
a
long
talk
with
the
commissary
of
police
and
tried
to
thrash
matters
out
if
only
your
theory
right
then
if
he
has
dared
yet
to
throw
suspicion
on
du
laurier
and
if
the
loss
of
that
with
its
contents
is
as
much
of
a
mystery
to
him
as
it
is
to
us
we
have
a
little
time
before
us
still
we
comparatively
safe
for
a
few
hours
we
as
safe
answered
maxine
with
a
kind
of
desperate
calmness
as
if
we
were
in
a
house
with
gunpowder
stored
underneath
and
a
train
laid
to
fire
it
but
she
broke
off
bitterly
why
do
i
say
to
you
all
this
can
be
no
more
than
a
regret
a
worry
you
know
that
not
just
i
reproached
her
i
in
this
with
you
now
heart
and
soul
i
spoke
no
more
than
the
truth
when
i
said
i
give
my
life
if
necessary
to
redeem
my
failure
already
i
given
something
but
what
have
you
given
she
caught
me
up
quickly
my
hope
of
happiness
with
a
girl
i
love
as
you
love
du
laurier
i
answered
then
regretted
my
words
and
would
have
taken
them
back
if
i
could
for
she
had
a
heavy
enough
burden
to
bear
already
without
helping
me
bear
mine
i
do
understand
she
said
do
think
of
it
you
can
do
nothing
and
i
do
grudge
the
sacrifice
or
anything
i
hurried
on
yet
i
will
think
of
it
if
i
ever
have
time
to
think
of
anything
beyond
this
tangle
but
now
it
must
be
save
me
save
raoul
if
you
can
ivor
what
you
can
do
i
do
know
i
groping
in
darkness
yet
you
my
one
hope
for
pity
sake
come
to
my
house
when
the
play
over
to
tell
me
what
you
done
if
you
been
able
to
do
anything
be
there
at
twelve
i
promise
thank
you
i
shall
live
for
that
moment
now
give
me
the
diamonds
and
i
go
i
do
want
you
to
be
seen
with
me
outside
this
room
i
gave
her
the
necklace
and
she
was
at
the
door
before
i
could
open
it
chapter
vii
ivor
is
late
for
an
appointment
i
was
glad
to
be
alone
for
as
i
had
said
i
wanted
to
think
quietly
maxine
had
taken
the
diamonds
but
she
had
slipped
the
necklace
into
the
bosom
of
her
dress
pressing
it
down
through
the
rather
opening
at
the
throat
and
had
therefore
left
the
leather
case
i
picked
the
thing
up
from
the
table
where
she
had
thrown
it
and
examined
it
carefully
for
the
first
time
it
had
not
been
originally
intended
as
a
that
was
clear
and
as
maxine
voice
had
rung
unmistakably
true
when
she
denied
all
previous
knowledge
of
it
to
the
police
i
judged
that
the
diamonds
had
not
been
in
it
when
the
duchess
entrusted
them
to
du
laurier
he
would
almost
certainly
have
described
to
maxine
the
box
or
case
which
had
been
stolen
from
him
and
if
the
thing
pulled
out
from
the
had
recalled
his
description
she
must
have
betrayed
some
emotion
under
the
keen
eyes
of
the
commissary
of
police
the
case
which
it
seemed
i
had
brought
to
paris
looked
as
if
it
might
have
been
made
to
hold
a
peculiar
kind
of
cigar
much
longer
than
the
ordinary
sort
within
on
either
side
was
a
partition
and
there
was
a
silver
clasp
on
which
the
hallmark
was
english
english
silver
i
said
to
myself
thoughtfully
the
three
men
who
had
travelled
in
the
carriage
with
me
from
london
to
dover
were
all
english
of
the
trio
only
the
nervous
little
fellow
who
had
reserved
the
compartment
for
himself
had
found
the
smallest
possible
opportunity
to
steal
the
treaty
from
me
and
exchange
for
it
this
red
leather
case
containing
a
diamond
necklace
worth
twenty
thousand
pounds
if
he
possessed
the
skill
and
quick
deftness
of
a
conjurer
or
a
marvellously
clever
professional
pickpocket
as
well
as
the
incentive
of
a
paid
spy
he
might
conceivably
have
done
the
trick
at
the
moment
of
alarm
on
the
boat
gangway
not
afterwards
for
when
he
had
pressed
near
me
in
the
gare
du
nord
he
had
been
on
the
wrong
side
but
for
my
life
i
could
not
guess
the
motive
for
such
an
exchange
supposing
him
a
spy
employed
to
track
and
rob
me
of
what
i
carried
why
should
he
have
made
me
a
present
of
these
rare
and
precious
diamonds
would
the
bribe
for
which
he
used
his
skill
reach
anything
like
the
sum
he
could
obtain
by
selling
the
stones
i
was
almost
sure
it
would
not
and
therefore
having
the
diamonds
it
would
have
been
far
more
to
his
advantage
to
keep
them
than
to
stuff
them
into
my
pocket
simply
to
fill
up
the
space
where
the
case
with
the
treaty
had
lain
there
would
not
have
been
time
yet
for
the
real
diamonds
to
have
been
copied
in
amsterdam
therefore
it
would
be
useless
to
build
up
a
theory
that
the
stones
given
me
might
be
false
besides
i
reminded
myself
if
the
man
were
a
spy
whose
business
was
to
watch
and
be
near
me
why
had
he
waited
to
see
what
i
would
do
where
i
would
go
instead
of
taking
a
compartment
carefully
reserving
it
and
trusting
to
such
an
unlikely
chance
as
that
i
might
force
myself
into
it
with
him
even
if
the
three
men
had
been
in
some
obscure
way
playing
into
each
others
hands
i
could
not
see
how
their
game
had
been
arranged
to
catch
me
maxine
and
i
had
talked
for
a
long
time
but
not
two
hours
had
passed
yet
since
i
saw
the
last
of
the
little
rat
of
a
man
in
the
though
i
could
not
understand
any
reason
for
his
tricking
me
still
i
told
myself
that
nobody
else
could
have
done
it
and
i
decided
to
go
back
at
once
to
the
gare
du
nord
there
i
might
still
be
able
to
find
some
trace
of
the
little
man
and
of
my
two
other
if
through
a
porter
or
cabman
i
could
learn
where
they
had
gone
i
might
have
a
chance
even
now
of
getting
back
the
stolen
treaty
i
had
brought
with
me
from
london
a
loaded
revolver
warned
by
the
foreign
secretary
that
to
do
so
would
be
a
wise
precaution
and
i
was
ready
to
make
use
of
it
if
necessary
i
was
beginning
to
be
very
hungry
but
that
was
a
detail
of
no
importance
for
i
had
no
time
to
waste
in
eating
i
went
to
the
and
looked
about
until
i
found
a
porter
whose
face
i
had
seen
when
i
got
out
of
the
train
he
had
in
fact
appeared
under
the
window
of
my
compartment
offering
himself
as
a
luggage
carrier
and
had
been
close
behind
me
when
my
late
travelling
companion
walked
by
my
side
questioned
he
appeared
not
to
remember
but
his
wits
being
sharpened
by
the
gift
of
a
franc
he
reflected
and
recalled
not
only
my
features
but
the
features
of
the
little
man
whom
he
described
with
sufficient
accuracy
what
had
become
of
petit
he
was
not
certain
but
fancied
he
had
eventually
driven
away
in
a
cab
accompanied
by
two
other
gentlemen
he
recollected
this
circumstance
because
the
face
of
the
cabman
was
one
that
he
knew
and
it
was
now
again
in
the
station
for
the
had
returned
would
he
point
out
the
to
me
he
would
and
did
receiving
a
second
franc
for
his
pains
the
cab
driver
proved
to
be
a
dull
and
surly
fellow
like
many
another
of
paris
but
the
clink
of
silver
and
the
sight
of
it
mellowed
him
i
began
by
saying
that
i
was
in
search
of
three
friends
of
mine
whom
i
was
to
have
met
when
the
boat
train
came
in
but
whom
i
had
unfortunately
missed
i
asked
him
to
describe
the
men
he
had
driven
away
from
the
station
at
that
time
and
though
he
did
it
clumsily
betraying
an
irritating
lack
of
observation
when
it
came
to
details
still
such
information
as
i
could
draw
from
him
sounded
encouraging
he
remembered
perfectly
well
the
place
at
which
he
had
deposited
his
three
passengers
and
i
decided
to
take
the
risk
of
following
them
when
i
say
risk
i
mean
the
risk
that
the
man
i
was
starting
to
chase
might
turn
out
not
to
be
the
man
i
wished
to
follow
besides
as
they
had
been
driven
to
neuilly
the
distance
was
so
great
that
if
i
went
there
in
a
cab
and
found
at
last
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
i
should
have
wasted
a
great
deal
of
valuable
time
on
the
wrong
tack
if
the
driver
had
remembered
the
name
of
the
street
and
the
number
of
the
house
at
which
he
had
paused
i
would
have
hired
a
motor
and
flashed
out
to
the
place
in
a
few
minutes
but
despite
a
suggested
bribe
he
could
say
no
more
than
that
when
he
had
come
to
a
certain
place
one
of
his
passengers
had
called
turn
down
the
next
street
to
the
left
he
had
done
so
and
in
front
of
a
house
almost
midway
along
that
street
he
had
been
bidden
to
stop
he
had
not
bothered
to
look
at
the
name
of
the
street
but
though
he
was
not
very
familiar
with
that
neighbourhood
various
landmarks
would
guide
him
to
the
right
place
when
he
came
to
pass
them
again
having
heard
all
he
had
to
say
i
reluctantly
made
up
my
mind
that
i
could
do
no
better
than
take
the
man
as
my
conductor
and
accordingly
with
a
horse
already
tired
i
drove
to
neuilly
there
the
landmarks
were
not
deceiving
as
i
was
half
afraid
they
would
be
and
in
a
quiet
street
of
the
suburb
we
stopped
at
last
before
a
house
with
lights
in
many
windows
evidently
it
was
a
of
the
who
answered
my
ring
i
enquired
if
three
english
gentlemen
had
lately
arrived
he
replied
that
they
had
and
were
dining
would
monsieur
give
himself
the
pain
of
waiting
a
few
minutes
until
dinner
should
be
over
my
answer
was
to
slip
a
five
franc
piece
into
the
servant
hand
and
suggest
that
i
should
be
shown
at
once
into
the
without
waiting
my
idea
was
to
catch
my
birds
while
they
fed
and
take
them
by
surprise
lest
they
fly
away
if
i
pounced
upon
them
in
the
midst
of
a
meal
at
least
they
could
not
escape
before
being
recognised
by
me
and
as
to
what
should
come
after
recognition
the
moment
of
meeting
must
decide
the
five
franc
piece
worked
like
a
charm
i
was
promptly
ushered
into
the
and
standing
just
inside
the
door
i
swept
the
long
table
with
a
quick
eager
glance
about
eighteen
or
twenty
people
were
dining
but
though
several
were
unmistakably
english
i
saw
no
one
who
resembled
my
travelling
companions
everyone
turned
and
stared
there
was
no
face
of
which
i
had
not
a
good
view
in
a
low
voice
i
asked
the
servant
which
were
the
new
arrivals
of
whom
he
had
spoken
he
pointed
them
out
and
added
that
though
they
had
come
only
that
day
from
england
they
were
old
patrons
well
known
in
the
house
as
i
lingered
deeply
disappointed
the
elderly
proprietor
of
the
who
superintended
the
comfort
of
his
guests
trotted
fussily
up
to
enquire
the
stranger
business
in
his
i
explained
that
i
had
hoped
to
find
friends
and
was
so
polite
that
i
contrived
to
get
permission
for
my
cabman
to
have
a
peep
through
the
crack
of
the
door
when
he
had
identified
his
three
passengers
all
hope
was
over
i
had
followed
the
wrong
men
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
back
to
the
gare
du
nord
and
question
more
porters
and
cabmen
nobody
could
give
me
any
information
worth
having
it
seemed
yet
the
little
man
must
have
left
the
station
in
a
vehicle
of
some
sort
as
he
had
a
great
deal
of
small
luggage
since
i
could
learn
nothing
of
him
or
his
movements
however
and
dared
not
because
of
maxine
and
the
british
foreign
secretary
apply
to
the
police
for
help
i
determined
to
lose
no
more
time
before
consulting
a
private
detective
a
man
whose
actions
i
could
control
and
to
whom
i
need
tell
only
as
much
of
the
truth
as
i
chose
without
fear
of
having
the
rest
dragged
out
of
me
at
my
own
hotel
i
enquired
of
the
manager
where
i
could
find
a
good
private
detective
got
an
address
and
motored
to
it
the
speed
bracing
my
nerves
fortunately
as
i
thought
then
monsieur
anatole
girard
was
at
home
and
able
to
receive
me
i
was
shown
into
the
plain
but
very
neat
little
of
a
flat
on
the
fifth
floor
of
a
big
new
apartment
house
and
was
impressed
at
first
glance
by
the
clever
face
of
the
dark
thin
frenchman
who
politely
bade
me
welcome
it
was
cunning
as
well
as
clever
no
doubt
but
then
i
told
myself
it
was
the
business
of
a
person
in
monsieur
girard
profession
to
be
cunning
i
introduced
myself
as
sanford
the
name
i
had
been
told
to
give
at
the
élysée
palace
hotel
this
seemed
best
as
it
was
in
the
hotel
that
i
had
been
recommended
to
monsieur
girard
and
complications
might
arise
if
george
sandford
suddenly
turned
into
ivor
dundas
besides
as
there
were
a
good
many
things
which
i
did
not
want
brought
to
light
sandford
seemed
the
man
to
fit
the
situation
later
he
could
easily
disappear
and
leave
no
trace
i
said
that
i
had
been
robbed
of
a
thing
which
was
of
immense
value
to
me
but
as
it
was
the
gift
of
a
lady
whose
name
must
not
on
any
account
appear
in
the
case
i
did
not
wish
to
consult
the
police
all
i
asked
of
monsieur
girard
ability
was
the
discovery
of
the
supposed
thief
whom
i
thereupon
described
i
added
the
fact
that
we
had
travelled
together
mentioned
the
incident
at
the
gangway
and
explained
that
i
had
not
suspected
my
loss
until
i
arrived
at
the
élysée
palace
hotel
girard
listened
quietly
evidently
realising
that
i
talked
to
him
from
behind
a
screen
of
reserve
yet
not
seeking
to
force
me
to
put
aside
that
screen
he
asked
several
intelligent
questions
very
much
to
the
point
and
i
answered
them
as
seemed
best
when
he
touched
on
points
which
i
considered
too
delicate
to
be
handled
by
a
stranger
even
a
detective
in
my
employ
i
frankly
replied
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
in
hand
shrugging
his
shoulders
almost
imperceptibly
yet
expressively
he
took
my
refusals
without
comment
and
merely
bowed
when
i
said
that
if
the
scoundrel
could
be
unearthed
within
hours
i
would
pay
a
hundred
pounds
if
within
twelve
a
hundred
and
fifty
if
within
six
two
hundred
i
added
that
there
was
not
a
second
to
waste
as
the
fellow
might
slip
out
of
paris
at
any
minute
but
whatever
happened
monsieur
girard
was
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
the
detective
promised
to
do
his
best
which
was
said
to
be
very
good
held
out
hopes
of
success
and
assured
me
of
his
discretion
on
the
whole
i
was
pleased
with
him
he
looked
like
a
man
who
thoroughly
knew
his
business
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
solemn
warning
of
the
foreign
secretary
and
the
risk
for
maxine
i
would
gladly
have
put
more
efficient
weapons
in
girard
hands
by
telling
him
everything
by
the
time
that
the
detective
had
been
primed
with
such
facts
and
details
as
i
could
give
it
was
past
ten
i
could
see
my
way
to
do
nothing
more
for
the
moment
and
as
i
was
half
famished
i
whizzed
back
in
my
hired
automobile
to
the
élysée
palace
hotel
there
i
had
food
served
in
my
own
lest
george
sandford
should
chance
inconveniently
upon
some
acquaintance
of
ivor
dundas
in
the
restaurant
i
did
not
hurry
over
the
meal
for
all
i
wanted
now
was
to
arrive
at
maxine
de
renzie
house
at
twelve
and
tell
her
my
news
or
lack
of
news
she
would
be
there
waiting
for
me
i
was
sure
no
matter
how
prompt
i
might
be
for
though
in
ordinary
circumstances
after
the
first
performance
of
a
new
play
either
maxine
would
have
gone
out
to
supper
or
invited
guests
to
sup
with
her
she
would
have
accepted
no
invitation
given
none
for
she
would
hurry
out
of
the
theatre
probably
without
waiting
to
remove
her
stage
and
she
would
go
home
unaccompanied
except
by
her
maid
maxine
lives
in
a
charming
little
house
set
back
in
its
own
garden
a
great
find
in
a
good
quarter
of
paris
and
her
house
could
he
reached
in
ten
minutes
drive
from
my
hotel
i
would
not
go
as
far
as
the
gate
but
would
dismiss
my
cab
at
the
corner
of
the
quiet
street
as
it
would
not
he
wise
to
advertise
the
fact
that
mademoiselle
de
renzie
was
receiving
a
visit
from
a
young
man
at
midnight
fifteen
minutes
would
give
me
plenty
of
time
for
all
this
therefore
at
about
a
quarter
to
twelve
i
started
to
go
downstairs
and
in
the
entrance
hall
almost
ran
against
the
last
person
on
earth
i
expected
to
see
diana
forrest
she
was
not
alone
of
course
but
for
a
second
or
two
i
saw
no
one
else
there
was
none
other
except
her
precious
and
beautiful
face
in
the
world
and
for
a
wild
instant
i
asked
myself
if
she
had
come
here
to
see
me
to
take
back
all
her
cruel
words
of
misunderstanding
and
to
take
me
hack
also
but
it
was
only
for
an
instant
a
very
mad
instant
then
i
realised
that
she
could
have
known
i
was
to
be
at
the
élysée
palace
hotel
and
that
even
if
she
had
she
would
not
have
dreamed
of
coming
to
me
as
common
sense
swept
my
brain
clear
i
saw
near
the
precious
and
beautiful
face
other
faces
lady
mountstuart
lord
mountstuart
lisa
drummond
and
bob
west
they
were
all
in
evening
dress
the
ladies
in
charming
wraps
which
appeared
to
consist
mostly
of
lace
and
chiffon
and
evidently
they
had
just
come
into
the
hotel
from
some
place
of
amusement
the
beautiful
face
which
had
been
pale
grew
rosy
at
sight
of
me
though
whether
with
amazement
or
anger
or
both
i
could
tell
lisa
smiled
looking
more
impish
even
than
usual
but
it
was
plain
that
the
others
lord
mountstuart
among
them
were
surprised
to
see
me
here
goodness
is
it
you
or
your
ghost
exclaimed
lady
mountstuart
in
the
soft
accents
of
california
which
have
never
changed
in
spite
of
the
long
years
of
her
married
life
in
england
if
it
had
been
my
ghost
it
would
have
vanished
immediately
to
save
di
from
embarrassment
and
also
to
prevent
any
delay
in
getting
to
maxine
but
unfortunately
a
flesh
and
blood
young
man
must
stop
for
conventional
politeness
before
he
can
disappear
no
matter
what
presses
i
said
how
do
you
do
to
everyone
adding
that
i
was
as
surprised
to
see
them
as
they
could
be
to
see
me
i
even
grinned
civilly
at
lord
robert
west
though
finding
him
here
with
di
looking
particularly
pleased
with
himself
made
me
want
to
knock
him
down
oh
it
was
a
plan
as
far
as
mounty
and
lord
robert
and
i
are
concerned
explained
lady
mountstuart
of
course
lord
robert
ought
to
have
been
at
the
duchess
bazaar
this
afternoon
but
then
he
wo
show
up
at
such
things
even
to
please
his
sister
and
di
and
lisa
were
to
have
represented
me
there
and
are
the
only
days
all
three
of
us
could
possibly
steal
to
get
away
and
look
at
a
most
wonderful
motor
car
made
for
a
rajah
who
died
before
it
was
ready
lord
robert
certainly
knows
more
about
automobiles
than
any
other
human
being
does
and
he
thought
this
was
just
what
i
would
want
di
had
the
most
horrid
headache
this
morning
poor
child
and
was
fit
for
the
fatigue
of
a
big
crush
so
as
she
a
splendid
sailor
i
persuaded
her
to
come
with
us
and
lisa
too
of
course
we
caught
the
afternoon
train
to
boulogne
and
had
such
a
glorious
crossing
that
we
actually
all
had
the
courage
to
dress
and
dine
at
madrid
was
it
plucky
of
us
but
collapsing
now
and
have
come
back
early
as
we
must
inspect
the
car
the
first
thing
morning
and
do
a
heap
of
shopping
afterwards
if
you
collapsing
i
must
keep
you
standing
here
a
moment
i
said
anxious
for
more
than
one
reason
to
get
away
di
was
looking
at
me
half
turned
from
me
purposely
i
did
doubt
she
had
begun
a
conversation
with
bob
west
who
beamed
with
joy
over
her
kindness
to
him
and
her
apparent
indifference
to
me
is
an
exaggeration
perhaps
laughed
lady
mountstuart
but
instead
of
keeping
us
standing
here
come
up
to
our
and
have
a
little
talk
and
whisky
and
soda
yes
do
come
dundas
her
husband
added
thank
you
both
i
stammered
trying
not
to
look
embarrassed
but
i
know
you
all
tired
and
and
perhaps
you
have
some
nice
engagement
piped
lisa
it
too
late
for
respectable
british
young
men
to
have
engagements
in
naughty
paris
said
lady
mountstuart
laughing
again
she
looks
very
handsome
when
she
laughs
and
knows
it
is
that
true
mr
dundas
it
depends
upon
the
engagement
i
managed
to
reply
calmly
but
then
as
di
suddenly
turned
and
looked
straight
at
me
with
marked
coldness
the
blood
sprang
up
to
my
face
i
began
to
stammer
again
like
a
young
ass
of
a
schoolboy
i
afraid
that
i
er
the
fact
is
i
engaged
a
matter
of
business
i
wish
i
could
get
out
of
it
but
i
ca
and
er
i
shall
have
to
run
off
or
i
will
be
late
then
i
mumbled
something
about
hoping
to
see
them
again
before
they
left
paris
and
escaped
knowing
that
i
had
made
a
horrid
mess
of
my
excuses
di
was
laughing
at
something
west
said
as
i
turned
away
and
though
perhaps
his
remark
and
her
laugh
had
nothing
to
do
with
me
my
ears
burned
and
there
was
a
cold
lump
of
iron
or
something
that
felt
like
it
where
my
heart
ought
to
have
been
now
was
lord
robert
time
to
propose
now
when
she
believed
me
faithless
and
unworthy
if
he
but
knew
it
and
i
was
afraid
that
he
would
know
it
i
got
out
into
the
open
air
feeling
as
one
of
the
under
porters
called
me
a
cab
i
gave
the
name
of
a
street
in
the
direction
but
at
some
distance
from
maxine
lest
ears
should
hear
which
ought
not
to
hear
and
it
was
only
when
we
were
well
away
from
the
hotel
that
i
amended
my
first
instructions
even
then
i
mentioned
the
street
leading
into
the
one
where
i
was
due
not
the
street
itself
i
added
for
i
had
delayed
eight
or
ten
minutes
longer
than
i
ought
and
this
had
upset
the
exactness
of
my
calculations
the
man
obeyed
nevertheless
instead
of
reaching
the
top
of
maxine
street
at
two
or
three
minutes
before
twelve
as
i
had
intended
it
was
nearly
ten
minutes
past
when
i
got
out
of
my
cab
at
the
corner
and
when
i
came
to
the
gate
of
the
house
a
clock
somewhere
was
striking
the
quarter
hour
after
midnight
maxine
de
renzie
part
chapter
viii
maxine
acts
on
the
stage
and
off
how
i
got
through
the
play
on
that
awful
night
i
do
know
when
i
went
onto
the
stage
to
take
up
my
cue
soon
after
the
beginning
of
the
first
act
my
brain
was
a
blank
i
could
not
remember
a
single
line
that
i
had
to
say
i
could
even
see
through
the
dazzling
mist
which
floated
before
my
eyes
to
recognise
raoul
in
the
box
where
i
knew
he
would
be
sitting
unless
something
had
happened
but
presently
i
was
conscious
of
one
pair
of
hands
clapping
more
than
all
the
rest
yes
raoul
was
there
i
felt
his
love
reaching
out
to
me
and
warming
my
chilled
heart
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
that
finds
its
way
through
shadows
i
must
not
fail
for
his
sake
i
must
not
fail
i
never
had
failed
and
i
would
not
now
above
all
not
now
it
was
the
thought
of
raoul
that
gave
me
back
my
courage
and
though
i
could
have
said
one
word
of
my
part
before
i
came
on
the
stage
to
answer
that
first
cue
by
the
time
the
applause
had
died
down
enough
to
let
me
speak
each
line
seemed
to
spring
into
my
mind
as
it
was
needed
then
i
got
out
of
myself
and
into
the
part
as
i
always
do
but
had
feared
not
to
do
the
audience
was
mine
to
play
with
as
i
liked
to
make
laugh
to
make
cry
and
clap
its
hands
or
shout
yet
for
once
i
feared
it
feared
that
great
crowd
of
people
out
there
as
a
lion
tamer
must
at
some
time
or
other
fear
one
of
his
lions
what
if
they
know
all
i
done
the
question
flashed
across
my
brain
what
if
a
voice
in
the
auditorium
should
suddenly
shout
that
maxine
de
renzie
had
betrayed
france
for
money
english
money
how
these
hands
which
applauded
would
tingle
to
seize
me
by
the
throat
and
choke
my
life
out
still
with
these
thoughts
murmuring
in
my
head
like
a
kind
of
dreadful
undertone
i
went
on
an
actress
can
always
go
on
till
she
breaks
i
think
that
she
ca
be
bent
as
other
women
can
and
i
envy
the
women
who
have
had
to
learn
the
lesson
of
hardening
themselves
it
seems
to
me
that
they
must
suffer
less
at
last
came
the
end
of
the
first
act
but
there
were
five
curtain
calls
five
times
i
had
to
go
back
and
smile
and
bow
and
look
delighted
with
the
ovation
i
was
having
then
when
the
time
came
that
i
could
escape
i
met
on
the
way
to
my
men
carrying
big
harps
and
crowns
baskets
and
bunches
of
flowers
which
had
been
sent
up
to
me
on
the
stage
i
pushed
past
hardly
glancing
at
them
for
i
knew
that
raoul
would
be
waiting
there
he
was
radiant
with
his
unselfish
pride
in
me
my
big
handsome
lover
looking
more
like
the
apollo
belvedere
come
alive
and
dressed
in
modern
clothes
than
like
an
ordinary
diplomatic
young
man
from
the
foreign
office
but
then
of
course
he
is
really
quite
out
of
place
in
diplomacy
since
he
ca
exist
on
a
marble
pedestal
or
some
old
master
canvas
he
ought
at
least
to
be
a
poet
or
an
artist
and
so
he
is
at
heart
not
one
but
both
and
a
dreamer
of
beautiful
dreams
as
beautiful
and
noble
as
his
own
face
which
might
be
cold
if
it
were
not
for
the
eyes
and
lips
there
were
people
about
and
we
spoke
like
mere
acquaintances
until
led
raoul
into
the
little
boudoir
which
adjoins
my
then
well
we
spoke
no
longer
like
mere
acquaintances
that
is
enough
to
say
and
we
had
five
minutes
together
before
i
was
obliged
to
send
him
away
and
go
to
dress
for
the
second
act
the
touch
of
raoul
hands
and
those
lips
of
his
that
are
not
cold
gave
me
strength
to
go
through
all
that
was
yet
to
come
something
almost
magical
in
the
touch
just
a
little
little
touch
of
the
one
we
love
best
for
a
moment
we
can
forget
everything
else
even
if
it
were
death
itself
waiting
just
round
the
corner
i
flirted
with
more
than
one
man
sometimes
because
i
liked
him
and
it
amused
me
as
with
ivor
dundas
sometimes
because
i
had
to
win
him
for
politic
reasons
but
i
never
knew
that
blessed
feeling
until
i
met
raoul
du
laurier
it
was
a
heavenly
rest
now
to
lay
my
head
for
a
minute
on
his
shoulder
just
shutting
my
eyes
without
speaking
a
word
i
thought
for
i
was
worn
out
body
and
soul
with
the
strain
of
keeping
up
and
hiding
my
secret
that
when
i
was
dead
the
best
paradise
would
be
to
lean
so
on
raoul
shoulder
never
moving
for
the
first
two
or
three
hundred
years
of
eternity
but
as
the
peaceful
fancy
cooled
my
brain
back
darted
remembrance
like
a
poisonous
snake
i
reminded
myself
how
little
i
deserved
such
a
paradise
and
how
my
lover
dear
arms
would
put
me
away
in
a
kind
of
unbelieving
horror
if
he
knew
what
i
had
done
and
how
i
had
betrayed
his
trust
in
me
for
ten
years
i
been
a
political
spy
yes
but
i
owed
a
grudge
to
russia
which
i
promised
my
father
to
pay
and
france
is
ally
besides
it
seems
less
vile
to
betray
a
country
than
to
deceive
a
man
you
adore
who
adores
you
in
return
we
women
are
true
as
truth
itself
to
those
we
love
for
them
we
would
sacrifice
the
greatest
cause
always
i
had
known
this
and
i
had
thought
that
i
could
prove
myself
truer
than
the
truest
if
i
ever
loved
yet
now
i
had
betrayed
my
lover
and
sold
his
country
and
realising
what
i
had
done
as
i
hardly
had
realised
it
till
this
moment
i
suffered
torture
in
his
arms
even
if
by
something
like
a
miracle
we
were
saved
from
ruin
nothing
on
earth
could
wash
the
stain
from
my
heart
which
raoul
believed
so
good
so
pure
what
can
be
more
terrible
for
a
woman
than
the
secret
knowledge
that
to
hold
a
man
respect
she
must
always
keep
one
dark
spot
covered
from
his
eyes
such
a
woman
needs
no
future
punishment
she
has
all
she
deserves
in
this
world
my
punishment
had
begun
and
it
would
always
go
on
through
my
life
with
raoul
i
knew
even
if
no
great
disaster
came
into
the
heart
of
my
happiness
would
come
the
thought
of
that
hidden
spot
how
often
oh
how
often
would
i
feel
that
thought
stir
like
a
black
bat
i
could
no
longer
rest
with
my
eyes
shut
at
peace
after
the
storm
i
shuddered
and
sobbed
though
my
lids
were
dry
and
raoul
tried
to
soothe
me
thinking
it
was
but
my
excitement
in
playing
for
the
first
time
a
heavy
and
exacting
part
he
little
guessed
how
heavy
and
exacting
it
really
was
darling
he
said
you
were
wonderful
and
how
proud
i
was
of
you
how
proud
i
am
i
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
worship
you
more
than
i
did
but
i
love
you
a
thousand
times
more
than
ever
it
was
true
i
knew
i
could
see
it
in
his
eyes
hear
it
in
his
voice
since
his
dreadful
misfortune
in
losing
the
diamonds
since
i
had
comforted
him
for
their
loss
and
insisted
on
giving
him
all
i
had
to
help
him
out
of
his
trouble
he
had
seen
in
me
the
angel
of
his
salvation
his
heart
was
almost
breaking
with
love
for
me
who
so
ill
deserved
it
now
i
had
news
for
him
which
would
make
him
long
to
shout
for
joy
if
i
chose
i
could
tell
him
that
the
jewels
were
safe
he
would
love
me
still
more
passionately
in
his
happiness
which
i
had
given
than
in
his
grief
and
i
would
take
all
his
love
as
if
it
were
my
right
hiding
the
secret
of
my
treachery
as
long
as
i
could
but
how
long
would
that
be
how
could
i
be
sure
that
the
theft
of
the
treaty
had
not
already
been
discovered
and
that
the
avalanche
of
ruin
was
not
on
its
way
to
blot
us
for
ever
out
of
life
and
love
the
fear
made
me
nestle
nearer
to
him
and
cling
tightly
because
i
said
to
myself
that
perhaps
i
might
never
be
in
his
arms
again
that
this
might
be
the
last
time
that
his
eyes
those
eyes
that
are
not
cold
might
look
at
me
with
love
in
them
as
now
suppose
all
these
people
out
there
had
hated
and
hissed
me
instead
of
applauding
i
asked
would
you
still
be
proud
of
me
still
care
for
me
i
love
you
better
if
there
could
be
a
he
answered
holding
me
very
close
you
know
dearest
one
most
beautiful
one
that
i
a
jealous
brute
i
ca
bear
you
to
belong
to
others
even
to
the
public
that
appreciates
you
almost
as
much
as
you
deserve
to
be
appreciated
of
course
i
proud
that
they
adore
you
but
i
like
to
take
you
away
from
them
and
adore
you
all
by
myself
why
if
the
whole
world
turned
against
you
be
a
kind
of
joy
in
that
for
me
i
be
so
glad
of
the
chance
to
face
it
for
you
to
shield
you
from
it
always
then
what
there
would
make
you
love
me
less
i
went
on
dwelling
on
the
subject
with
a
dreadful
fascination
as
one
looks
over
the
brink
of
a
precipice
nothing
on
god
earth
while
you
kept
true
to
me
and
if
i
were
true
if
i
deceived
you
why
i
kill
you
and
myself
after
but
it
makes
me
see
red
a
blazing
scarlet
even
to
think
of
such
a
thing
why
should
you
speak
of
it
when
it
beyond
possibility
thank
heaven
i
know
you
love
me
or
you
would
make
such
noble
sacrifices
to
save
me
from
ruin
i
shivered
and
i
shall
not
be
colder
when
they
lay
me
in
my
coffin
i
wished
that
i
had
not
looked
over
that
precipice
down
into
blackness
why
dwell
on
horrors
when
i
might
have
five
minutes
of
happiness
perhaps
the
last
i
should
ever
know
i
remembered
the
piece
of
good
news
i
had
for
raoul
i
would
have
told
him
then
but
he
went
on
saying
to
me
so
many
things
sweet
and
blessed
to
hear
that
i
could
not
bear
to
cut
him
short
lest
never
after
this
should
he
speak
words
of
love
to
me
then
long
before
it
ought
so
it
seemed
the
clock
in
struck
and
i
knew
that
i
had
another
instant
to
spare
on
some
first
nights
i
might
have
been
willing
to
risk
keeping
the
curtain
down
though
i
am
rather
conscientious
in
such
ways
but
i
wanted
more
than
anything
else
to
have
the
play
over
and
to
get
home
by
midnight
or
before
so
that
my
suspense
might
be
ended
and
i
might
know
the
worst
or
best
i
must
go
you
must
leave
me
dear
i
said
but
i
some
good
news
for
you
when
there
time
to
explain
and
a
great
surprise
i
ca
give
you
a
minute
until
the
last
for
you
know
i
almost
to
open
the
third
and
fourth
acts
but
when
the
curtain
goes
down
on
my
death
scene
come
behind
again
i
sha
take
any
calls
after
dying
it
too
inartistic
is
it
and
i
never
do
i
see
you
for
just
a
few
more
minutes
here
in
this
room
before
i
dress
to
go
home
for
a
few
minutes
raoul
caught
me
up
but
afterwards
you
promised
me
long
ago
that
i
should
have
supper
with
you
at
your
house
just
you
and
i
alone
together
on
the
first
night
of
the
new
play
my
heart
gave
a
jump
as
he
reminded
me
of
this
promise
never
before
had
i
forgotten
an
engagement
with
raoul
but
this
time
i
had
forgotten
there
had
been
so
many
miserable
things
to
think
of
that
they
had
crowded
the
one
pleasant
thing
out
of
my
tortured
brain
i
drew
away
from
him
involuntarily
with
a
start
of
surprise
you
forgotten
exclaimed
raoul
disappointed
and
hurt
only
for
the
instant
i
said
because
i
hardly
myself
i
tired
and
excited
unstrung
as
i
always
am
on
first
nights
but
would
you
rather
not
be
bothered
with
me
he
asked
wistfully
as
i
paused
to
think
what
i
should
do
his
eyes
looked
as
if
the
light
had
suddenly
gone
out
of
them
and
i
could
bear
that
it
might
too
soon
be
struck
out
for
ever
and
by
me
do
say
i
reproached
him
that
a
cruel
word
the
question
is
i
worn
out
i
do
think
i
shall
be
able
to
eat
supper
my
maid
will
want
to
put
me
to
bed
the
minute
i
get
home
poor
old
marianne
she
such
a
tyrant
when
she
fancies
it
for
my
good
it
generally
ends
in
my
obeying
her
seldom
in
her
obeying
me
but
see
how
i
feel
when
the
last
act
over
we
talk
of
it
when
you
come
here
after
my
death
i
tried
to
laugh
as
i
made
that
wretched
jest
but
i
was
sorry
when
i
made
it
and
my
laugh
did
ring
true
there
was
a
shadow
on
raoul
face
that
dear
sensitive
face
of
his
which
shows
too
much
feeling
for
a
man
in
this
strenuous
world
but
i
had
little
time
to
comfort
him
it
will
be
like
coming
to
life
again
to
see
you
i
said
and
now
no
not
but
i
sent
him
away
and
flew
into
my
next
door
where
marianne
was
growing
very
nervous
and
aimlessly
shifting
my
things
on
the
dressing
table
or
fussing
with
some
part
of
my
dress
for
the
next
act
there
a
letter
for
you
mademoiselle
said
she
the
keeper
just
brought
it
round
but
you
have
time
to
read
it
now
a
wave
of
faintness
swept
over
me
supposing
ivor
had
had
bad
news
and
thought
it
best
to
warn
me
without
delay
i
must
read
the
letter
i
insisted
give
it
to
me
at
once
occasionally
marianne
who
has
been
with
me
for
many
years
and
is
old
enough
to
be
my
mother
argues
a
matter
on
which
we
disagree
but
something
in
my
voice
i
suppose
made
her
obey
me
with
extraordinary
promptness
then
came
a
shock
and
not
of
relief
i
recognised
on
the
envelope
the
handwriting
of
count
godensky
i
know
that
i
am
not
a
coward
yet
it
was
only
by
the
strongest
effort
of
will
that
i
forced
myself
to
open
that
letter
i
was
afraid
afraid
of
a
hundred
things
but
most
of
all
i
was
afraid
of
learning
that
the
treaty
was
in
his
hands
it
would
be
like
him
to
tell
me
he
had
it
and
try
to
drive
some
dreadful
bargain
nerving
myself
as
i
suppose
a
condemned
criminal
must
nerve
himself
to
go
to
the
guillotine
or
the
gallows
i
opened
the
letter
for
as
long
as
i
might
have
counted
one
two
slowly
the
paper
looked
black
before
my
eyes
as
if
ink
were
spilt
over
it
blotting
out
the
words
but
the
dark
smudge
cleared
away
and
showed
me
nothing
except
that
if
alexis
godensky
held
a
trump
card
i
was
not
to
have
a
sight
of
it
until
later
when
he
chose
my
dear
maxine
he
began
his
letter
though
he
had
never
been
given
the
right
to
call
me
maxine
and
never
had
dared
so
to
call
me
before
i
must
see
you
and
talk
to
you
this
evening
alone
this
for
your
own
sake
and
that
of
another
even
more
than
mine
though
you
know
very
well
what
it
is
to
me
to
be
with
you
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
guess
that
this
is
important
i
am
so
sure
that
you
guess
and
that
you
will
not
only
be
willing
but
anxious
to
see
me
if
you
never
were
before
that
i
shall
venture
to
be
waiting
for
you
at
the
stage
door
when
you
come
out
yours
in
whatever
way
you
will
alexis
if
anything
could
have
given
me
pleasure
at
that
moment
it
would
have
been
to
tear
the
letter
in
little
pieces
with
the
writer
looking
on
then
to
throw
those
pieces
in
his
hateful
face
and
say
that
your
answer
but
he
was
not
looking
on
and
even
if
he
had
been
i
could
not
have
done
what
i
wished
he
knew
that
i
would
have
to
consent
to
see
him
that
he
need
have
no
fear
i
would
profit
by
my
knowledge
of
his
intentions
to
order
him
sent
away
from
the
stage
door
i
would
have
to
see
him
but
how
could
i
manage
it
after
refusing
as
i
must
refuse
to
let
raoul
go
home
with
me
raoul
was
coming
to
me
after
my
death
scene
on
the
stage
at
the
very
least
he
would
expect
to
put
me
into
my
carriage
when
i
left
the
theatre
even
if
he
went
no
further
yet
there
would
be
godensky
waiting
and
raoul
would
see
him
what
could
i
do
to
escape
from
such
an
chapter
ix
maxine
gives
back
the
diamonds
i
tried
to
answer
the
question
to
decide
something
but
my
brain
felt
dead
i
ca
think
now
i
must
trust
to
luck
trust
to
luck
i
said
to
myself
desperately
as
marianne
dressed
me
by
and
by
i
think
it
all
out
but
after
that
my
part
gave
me
no
more
time
to
think
i
was
not
maxine
de
renzie
but
princess
hélène
of
hungaria
whose
tragic
fate
was
even
more
sure
and
swift
than
miserable
maxine
when
princess
hélène
had
died
in
her
lover
arms
however
died
as
maxine
had
not
deserved
to
die
and
i
was
able
to
pick
up
the
tangled
threads
of
my
own
life
where
i
laid
them
down
the
questions
were
still
crying
out
for
answer
and
must
somehow
be
decided
at
once
first
there
was
raoul
to
be
put
off
and
got
out
of
the
way
raoul
my
best
beloved
whose
help
and
protection
i
needed
so
much
yet
must
forego
and
hurt
him
instead
the
keeper
had
orders
to
let
him
come
behind
and
so
he
was
already
waiting
at
the
door
of
my
little
boudoir
by
the
time
hélène
had
died
the
curtain
had
gone
down
and
maxine
de
renzie
had
been
able
to
leave
the
stage
as
we
went
together
into
the
room
he
caught
both
my
hands
crushing
them
tightly
in
his
and
kissing
them
over
and
over
again
but
his
face
was
pale
and
sad
and
a
new
fear
sprang
up
in
my
heart
like
a
sudden
live
flame
among
red
ashes
what
is
it
raoul
why
do
you
look
like
that
i
asked
while
inside
my
head
another
question
sounded
like
a
shriek
what
if
some
word
had
come
to
him
in
the
theatre
about
the
treaty
then
i
could
have
cried
as
a
child
cries
with
the
snapping
of
the
tension
when
he
answered
it
was
only
that
terrible
last
scene
darling
i
seen
you
die
in
other
parts
but
it
never
affected
me
like
this
perhaps
it
because
you
did
belong
to
me
in
those
days
or
is
it
that
you
were
more
realistic
in
your
acting
than
ever
before
anyway
it
was
awful
so
horribly
real
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
sit
still
and
not
jump
out
of
the
box
to
save
you
prince
cyril
was
a
poor
chap
not
to
thwart
the
villain
i
should
have
killed
him
in
the
third
act
and
then
hélène
might
have
been
happily
married
instead
of
dying
i
believe
you
would
have
killed
him
i
said
i
know
i
should
it
a
mistake
not
to
be
jealous
i
admit
that
jealous
but
such
jealousy
is
a
compliment
to
a
woman
my
dearest
not
an
insult
how
you
feel
things
i
exclaimed
even
a
play
on
the
stage
if
the
woman
i
love
is
the
heroine
will
you
ever
be
blasé
like
the
rest
of
the
men
i
know
i
laughed
though
i
could
have
sobbed
never
i
think
it
is
in
me
do
you
despise
me
for
my
enthusiasm
i
only
love
you
the
more
i
said
wondering
every
instant
in
a
kind
of
horrid
undertone
how
i
was
to
get
him
away
i
admit
i
was
made
for
diplomacy
he
went
on
i
wish
i
had
money
enough
to
get
out
of
it
and
take
you
off
the
stage
away
into
some
beautiful
peaceful
world
where
we
need
think
of
nothing
but
our
love
for
each
other
and
the
good
we
might
do
others
because
of
our
love
and
to
keep
our
world
beautiful
would
you
go
with
me
ah
if
i
could
i
sighed
if
i
could
go
with
you
away
into
that
beautiful
peaceful
world
knows
meanwhile
meanwhile
you
do
mean
to
send
me
away
from
you
he
pleaded
in
a
coaxing
way
he
has
which
is
part
of
his
charm
and
makes
him
seem
like
a
boy
you
do
know
what
it
is
after
that
scene
of
your
death
on
the
stage
where
i
could
get
to
you
where
another
man
was
your
lover
to
touch
you
again
alive
and
warm
your
own
adorable
vivid
self
you
let
me
go
home
with
you
in
your
carriage
anyhow
as
far
as
the
house
and
kiss
you
there
even
if
you
so
tired
you
must
drive
me
out
then
i
would
have
given
all
my
success
of
that
night
and
more
to
say
yes
but
instead
i
had
to
stumble
into
excuses
i
had
to
argue
that
we
must
be
seen
leaving
the
theatre
together
yet
until
everyone
knew
that
we
were
engaged
as
for
letting
him
come
to
me
at
home
if
he
dreamt
how
my
head
ached
he
would
ask
it
i
almost
broke
down
as
i
said
this
and
poor
raoul
was
so
sorry
for
me
that
he
immediately
offered
to
leave
me
at
once
it
a
great
sacrifice
though
to
give
up
what
i
been
looking
forward
to
for
days
he
said
and
to
let
you
go
from
me
of
all
nights
why
of
all
nights
i
asked
quickly
my
coward
conscience
frightening
me
again
only
because
i
love
you
more
than
ever
and
it
a
stupid
feeling
of
course
i
suppose
all
the
fault
of
that
last
scene
in
the
play
yet
i
feel
as
if
but
no
i
do
want
to
say
it
you
must
say
it
i
cried
well
if
only
to
hear
you
contradict
me
then
i
feel
as
if
i
were
in
danger
of
losing
you
it
just
a
feeling
a
weight
on
my
heart
nothing
more
rather
womanish
is
it
not
womanish
but
foolish
i
said
shake
off
the
feeling
as
one
wakes
up
from
a
nightmare
think
of
meeting
then
will
be
all
the
sweeter
as
i
spoke
it
was
as
if
a
voice
echoed
mine
saying
different
words
mockingly
if
there
be
any
meeting
or
ever
i
shut
my
ears
to
the
voice
and
went
on
quickly
before
we
say
i
something
to
show
you
something
like
very
much
wait
here
till
i
get
it
from
the
next
room
marianne
was
tidying
my
for
the
night
bustling
here
and
there
a
dear
old
comfortable
dependable
thing
she
was
delighted
with
my
success
which
she
knew
all
about
of
course
but
she
was
not
in
the
least
excited
because
she
had
loyally
expected
me
to
succeed
and
would
have
thought
the
sky
must
be
about
to
fall
if
i
had
failed
she
was
as
placid
as
she
was
on
other
less
important
nights
far
more
placid
than
she
would
have
been
if
she
had
known
that
she
was
guarding
not
only
my
jewellery
but
a
famous
diamond
necklace
worth
at
least
five
hundred
thousand
francs
there
it
was
under
the
lowest
tray
of
my
jewel
box
i
had
felt
perfectly
safe
in
leaving
it
there
for
i
knew
that
nothing
on
earth
short
of
a
bomb
explosion
could
tempt
the
good
creature
out
of
my
in
my
absence
and
that
even
if
a
bomb
did
explode
she
would
try
to
be
blown
up
with
my
jewel
box
clutched
in
her
hands
saying
nothing
to
marianne
who
was
brushing
a
little
stage
dust
off
my
third
act
dress
with
my
back
to
her
i
took
out
tray
after
tray
from
the
box
which
always
came
with
us
to
the
theatre
and
went
away
again
in
my
carriage
until
the
electric
light
over
the
dressing
table
set
the
diamonds
on
fire
really
i
said
to
myself
they
were
wonderful
stones
i
had
no
idea
how
magnificent
they
were
not
that
there
were
a
great
many
of
them
the
necklace
was
composed
of
a
single
row
of
diamonds
with
six
flat
tassels
depending
from
it
but
the
smallest
stones
at
the
back
where
the
clasp
came
were
as
large
as
my
little
finger
nail
and
the
largest
were
almost
the
size
of
a
filbert
all
were
of
perfect
colour
and
fire
extraordinarily
deep
and
faultlessly
shaped
as
well
as
flawless
besides
the
necklace
had
a
history
which
would
have
made
it
interesting
even
if
it
had
been
intrinsically
of
half
its
value
with
the
first
thrill
of
pleasure
i
had
felt
since
i
knew
that
the
treaty
had
disappeared
i
lifted
the
beautiful
diamonds
from
the
box
and
slipped
them
into
a
small
embroidered
bag
of
pink
and
silver
brocade
which
lay
on
the
table
it
was
a
foolish
but
pretty
little
bag
which
a
friend
had
made
and
sent
to
me
at
the
theatre
a
few
nights
ago
and
was
intended
to
carry
a
purse
and
handkerchief
but
i
had
never
used
it
yet
now
it
seemed
a
convenient
receptacle
for
the
necklace
and
i
suddenly
planned
out
my
way
of
giving
it
to
raoul
at
first
earlier
in
the
evening
i
had
meant
to
put
the
diamonds
in
his
hands
and
say
see
what
i
have
for
you
but
now
i
had
changed
my
mind
because
he
must
be
induced
to
go
away
as
quickly
as
possible
quite
quite
away
from
the
theatre
so
that
there
would
be
no
danger
of
his
seeing
count
godensky
at
the
stage
door
i
was
not
sorry
that
raoul
was
jealous
because
as
he
said
his
jealousy
was
a
compliment
to
me
and
it
is
possible
only
for
a
cold
man
never
to
be
jealous
of
a
woman
in
my
profession
who
lives
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
but
i
did
not
want
him
to
be
jealous
of
the
russian
and
he
would
be
horribly
jealous
if
he
thought
that
he
had
the
least
cause
if
i
showed
him
the
diamonds
now
he
would
want
to
stop
and
talk
he
would
ask
me
questions
which
i
would
rather
not
answer
until
i
seen
ivor
dundas
again
and
knew
better
what
to
say
whether
truth
or
fiction
still
i
wished
raoul
to
have
the
necklace
because
it
would
mean
all
the
difference
to
him
between
constant
gnawing
anxiety
and
the
joy
of
deliverance
let
him
have
a
happy
night
even
though
i
was
sending
him
away
even
though
i
did
not
know
what
might
bring
either
for
him
or
for
me
i
tied
the
gold
cords
of
the
bag
in
two
hard
knots
and
went
out
with
it
to
raoul
in
the
next
room
this
holds
something
precious
i
said
smiling
at
him
and
making
a
mystery
you
value
the
something
i
know
partly
for
itself
partly
because
i
because
i
been
at
a
lot
of
trouble
to
get
it
for
you
when
you
see
it
you
be
more
resigned
not
to
see
me
just
for
tonight
but
you
to
write
me
a
letter
please
and
describe
accurately
every
one
of
your
sensations
on
opening
the
bag
also
you
may
say
in
your
letter
a
few
kind
things
about
me
if
you
like
and
i
want
it
to
come
to
me
when
i
first
wake
up
morning
so
go
now
dearest
and
have
the
sensations
and
write
about
them
i
shall
be
thinking
of
you
every
minute
asleep
or
awake
why
may
i
look
now
asked
raoul
taking
the
soft
mass
of
pink
and
silver
from
me
in
the
nice
clumsy
way
a
big
man
has
of
handling
a
woman
things
because
just
but
perhaps
you
guess
why
by
and
by
i
said
then
i
held
up
my
face
to
be
kissed
and
he
bundled
the
small
bag
away
in
an
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
as
carelessly
as
if
it
held
nothing
but
a
handkerchief
and
a
pair
of
gloves
be
careful
i
could
help
exclaiming
but
i
do
think
he
heard
for
he
had
me
in
his
arms
and
was
kissing
me
as
if
he
knew
the
fear
in
my
heart
the
fear
that
it
might
be
for
the
last
time
chapter
x
maxine
drives
with
the
enemy
when
raoul
was
gone
i
made
marianne
hurry
me
out
of
the
and
filmy
tissue
in
which
the
unfortunate
princess
hélène
had
died
and
into
the
black
gown
in
which
the
almost
equally
unfortunate
maxine
had
come
to
the
theatre
i
did
not
even
stop
to
take
off
my
for
though
the
play
was
an
unusually
short
one
and
all
the
actors
and
actresses
had
followed
my
example
of
prompt
readiness
for
all
four
acts
it
lacked
twenty
minutes
of
twelve
when
i
was
dressed
i
had
to
see
count
godensky
get
rid
of
him
somehow
and
still
be
in
time
to
keep
my
appointment
with
ivor
dundas
for
which
i
knew
he
would
strain
every
nerve
not
to
be
late
my
electric
carriage
would
be
at
the
stage
door
and
my
plan
was
to
speak
to
godensky
if
he
were
waiting
if
possible
learn
in
a
moment
or
two
whether
he
had
really
found
out
the
truth
and
then
act
accordingly
but
if
i
could
avoid
it
i
meant
in
any
case
to
put
off
a
long
conversation
until
later
i
had
drawn
my
veil
down
before
walking
out
of
the
theatre
yet
godensky
knew
me
at
once
and
came
forward
evidently
he
had
been
watching
the
door
he
said
a
hundred
congratulations
he
put
out
his
hand
and
i
had
to
give
him
mine
for
my
chauffeur
and
the
keeper
to
say
nothing
of
marianne
who
followed
me
closely
and
several
with
other
employés
of
the
theatre
were
within
seeing
and
hearing
distance
i
wanted
no
gossip
though
that
was
exactly
what
might
best
please
count
godensky
i
got
your
note
i
answered
in
russian
though
he
had
spoken
in
french
what
is
it
you
want
to
see
me
about
something
that
ca
be
told
in
a
moment
he
said
something
of
great
importance
i
very
tired
i
sighed
ca
it
wait
until
i
tried
to
draw
him
and
to
a
certain
extent
i
succeeded
you
would
ask
that
question
if
you
guessed
what
i
know
he
replied
was
it
a
bluff
or
did
he
know
not
merely
suspect
something
i
do
understand
you
i
said
quietly
though
my
lips
were
dry
shall
i
mention
the
word
he
hinted
really
i
sure
you
wo
regret
it
if
you
let
me
drive
home
with
you
mademoiselle
i
ca
do
that
i
answered
and
i
ca
take
you
into
my
carriage
here
but
i
stop
for
you
and
wait
at
the
corner
rue
eugène
beauharnais
then
you
can
go
with
me
until
i
think
it
best
for
you
to
get
out
very
well
he
agreed
but
send
your
maid
home
in
a
cab
i
can
not
talk
before
her
yes
you
can
she
knows
no
language
except
french
and
a
little
english
she
always
drives
home
with
me
this
was
true
but
if
i
had
been
talking
to
raoul
i
would
perhaps
have
given
the
dear
old
woman
her
first
experience
of
being
sent
off
by
herself
in
that
case
she
would
not
have
minded
for
she
likes
raoul
admires
him
as
a
dream
of
a
young
man
and
already
suspected
what
i
had
yet
told
her
that
we
were
engaged
but
with
count
godensky
forced
upon
me
as
a
companion
i
would
not
for
any
consideration
have
parted
with
marianne
three
or
four
minutes
after
starting
i
was
giving
instructions
to
my
chauffeur
where
to
stop
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
godensky
appeared
he
got
in
and
took
the
place
at
my
left
marianne
silent
but
doubtless
astonished
facing
us
on
the
little
front
seat
now
i
exclaimed
please
begin
quickly
do
force
me
to
be
too
abrupt
he
said
i
would
spare
you
if
i
could
you
speak
as
if
you
grudged
me
every
moment
with
you
yet
i
am
here
because
i
love
you
oh
please
monsieur
i
broke
in
you
know
i
told
you
that
is
useless
but
everything
is
changed
since
then
perhaps
now
even
your
mind
will
be
changed
that
happens
with
women
sometimes
i
want
to
warn
you
of
a
great
danger
that
threatens
you
maxine
perhaps
late
as
it
is
i
could
save
you
from
it
if
you
let
me
save
me
from
what
i
asked
temporising
you
very
mysterious
count
godensky
and
i
mademoiselle
de
renzie
except
to
my
very
intimate
friends
i
am
your
friend
always
maybe
you
will
even
permit
me
to
speak
of
myself
as
your
friend
when
i
have
done
what
i
hope
to
do
for
you
in
in
the
matter
of
a
certain
document
which
has
disappeared
i
was
quivering
all
over
but
i
had
not
lost
hope
yet
i
think
that
some
women
feeling
as
i
did
would
have
fainted
but
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
to
die
and
be
out
of
my
troubles
for
ever
than
to
let
myself
faint
and
show
godensky
that
he
had
struck
home
be
quiet
be
cool
be
brave
now
if
never
again
i
said
to
myself
and
my
voice
sounded
perfectly
natural
as
i
exclaimed
oh
the
again
the
one
you
spoke
about
when
we
first
met
you
rouse
my
curiosity
but
i
do
in
the
least
know
what
you
mean
the
loss
of
it
is
known
he
said
ah
it
a
lost
document
as
you
will
be
lost
maxine
if
you
do
come
to
me
for
the
help
only
too
glad
to
give
on
conditions
let
me
tell
you
what
they
are
would
it
be
more
to
the
point
if
you
told
me
what
the
document
is
and
how
it
concerns
me
i
parried
him
determined
to
bring
him
to
bay
are
evading
the
point
far
more
than
i
the
document
which
you
and
i
can
both
see
as
plainly
before
our
eyes
at
this
instant
as
though
it
were
in
let
us
say
your
hands
or
du
laurier
if
he
were
here
that
document
is
far
too
important
even
to
name
within
hearing
of
other
ears
marianne
but
i
told
you
she
ca
understand
a
word
of
russian
one
ca
be
sure
we
can
never
tell
in
these
days
who
may
not
be
a
spy
there
was
a
stab
for
me
but
i
would
not
give
him
the
satisfaction
of
showing
that
it
hurt
he
wanted
to
confuse
me
to
put
me
off
my
guard
but
he
should
not
they
say
one
judges
others
by
one
self
i
laughed
count
godensky
if
you
throw
out
such
lurid
hints
about
my
poor
fat
marianne
i
shall
begin
to
wonder
if
it
not
who
are
the
spy
since
you
trust
your
woman
so
implicitly
then
he
went
on
i
tell
you
what
you
want
to
know
the
document
i
speak
of
is
the
one
you
took
out
of
the
foreign
office
the
other
day
when
you
called
on
your
friend
monsieur
le
vicomte
du
laurier
dear
me
i
exclaimed
you
say
you
want
to
be
my
friend
yet
you
seem
to
think
i
am
a
kleptomaniac
i
ca
imagine
what
i
should
want
with
any
dry
old
document
out
of
the
foreign
office
can
you
yes
i
can
imagine
said
godensky
drily
pray
tell
me
then
also
what
document
it
was
for
joking
apart
this
is
rather
a
serious
accusation
if
i
make
any
accusation
it
less
against
you
than
du
laurier
oh
you
make
an
accusation
against
him
why
do
you
make
it
to
me
as
a
warning
or
because
you
do
dare
make
it
to
anyone
else
dare
i
have
accused
him
thus
far
because
to
do
so
would
brand
your
name
with
his
ah
i
said
you
are
very
considerate
i
do
pretend
to
be
considerate
except
of
myself
i
waited
and
held
my
hand
until
now
because
i
wanted
to
see
you
before
doing
a
thing
which
would
mean
certain
ruin
for
du
laurier
i
love
you
as
much
as
i
ever
did
even
more
because
in
common
with
most
men
i
value
what
i
find
hard
to
get
i
ask
you
again
to
marry
me
give
me
a
different
answer
from
that
you
gave
me
before
and
i
be
silent
about
what
i
know
what
you
know
of
the
document
you
mentioned
i
asked
my
heart
drumming
an
echo
of
its
beating
in
my
ears
yes
but
i
thought
you
said
that
its
loss
was
already
discovered
oh
i
was
keeping
myself
well
under
control
though
a
mistake
now
would
surely
cost
me
more
than
i
dared
count
for
half
a
second
he
was
taken
aback
at
a
loss
what
answer
to
make
half
a
second
no
more
yet
that
hardly
perceptible
hesitation
told
me
what
i
had
been
playing
with
him
to
find
out
discovered
by
me
he
explained
that
is
by
me
and
one
person
over
whom
i
have
such
an
influence
that
he
will
use
his
knowledge
or
forget
it
according
to
my
advice
there
is
no
such
person
i
said
to
myself
but
i
did
say
it
aloud
quickly
i
named
over
in
my
mind
such
men
in
the
french
foreign
office
as
were
in
a
position
to
discover
the
disappearance
of
any
document
under
raoul
du
laurier
charge
there
were
several
who
might
have
done
so
some
above
raoul
in
authority
some
below
but
i
was
certain
that
not
one
of
them
was
an
intimate
friend
of
count
godensky
if
he
had
suspected
anything
the
day
he
met
me
coming
out
of
the
foreign
office
he
might
of
course
have
hinted
his
suspicions
to
one
of
those
men
though
all
along
i
believed
him
too
shrewd
to
risk
the
consequences
the
ridicule
and
humiliation
of
a
mistake
but
if
he
had
spoken
it
would
be
beyond
his
power
to
prevent
matters
from
taking
their
own
course
independent
of
my
decisions
and
his
actions
i
believed
now
that
what
i
had
hoped
was
true
he
was
bluffing
he
wanted
me
to
flounder
into
some
admission
and
to
make
him
a
promise
in
order
to
save
the
man
i
loved
i
was
only
a
woman
he
argued
no
doubt
an
emotional
woman
already
wrought
up
to
a
high
pitch
of
nervous
excitement
perhaps
he
had
expected
to
have
easy
work
with
me
and
i
do
think
that
my
silence
after
his
last
words
discouraged
him
he
imagined
me
writhing
at
the
alternative
of
giving
up
raoul
or
seeing
him
ruined
and
he
believed
that
he
knew
me
well
enough
to
be
sure
what
i
would
do
in
the
end
well
he
said
at
last
quite
gently
my
eyes
had
been
bent
on
my
lap
but
i
glanced
suddenly
up
at
him
and
saw
his
face
in
the
light
of
the
street
lamps
as
we
passed
count
godensky
is
not
more
mephistophelian
in
type
than
any
other
dark
thin
man
with
a
hook
nose
keen
eyes
heavy
browed
a
prominent
chin
and
a
sharply
waxed
military
moustache
trained
to
point
upward
slightly
at
the
ends
but
to
my
fancy
he
looked
absolutely
devilish
at
that
moment
still
i
was
less
afraid
of
him
than
i
had
been
since
the
day
i
stole
the
treaty
well
i
said
slowly
i
think
it
time
that
you
left
me
now
that
your
answer
you
ca
mean
it
i
do
mean
it
just
as
much
as
i
meant
to
refuse
you
the
three
other
times
that
you
did
me
the
same
honour
you
asked
me
to
hear
what
you
had
to
say
and
i
have
heard
it
so
there
no
reason
why
i
should
press
the
electric
bell
for
my
chauffeur
to
stop
and
do
you
know
that
you
pronouncing
du
laurier
doom
to
say
nothing
of
your
own
no
i
do
know
it
then
i
have
made
myself
clear
enough
that
true
you
have
made
yourself
clear
enough
in
what
detail
have
i
failed
because
in
the
detail
of
the
document
i
told
you
i
know
nothing
about
it
you
told
me
you
know
everything
yet
so
i
do
prove
that
by
saying
what
it
is
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
i
explained
why
i
ca
do
that
here
then
why
should
you
stay
here
longer
since
that
is
the
point
to
my
mind
you
understood
before
you
came
into
my
carriage
that
i
had
no
intention
of
letting
you
go
all
the
way
home
with
me
count
godensky
suddenly
laughed
and
the
laugh
frightened
me
frightened
me
horribly
just
as
i
had
begun
to
have
confidence
in
myself
and
feel
that
i
had
got
the
best
of
the
game
chapter
xi
maxine
opens
the
gate
for
a
man
you
are
afraid
that
du
laurier
may
find
out
he
said
but
he
knows
already
knows
what
that
i
expected
to
have
the
privilege
of
going
to
your
house
with
you
all
that
i
had
gained
seemed
worthless
those
quiet
sneering
words
of
his
almost
crushed
me
on
the
load
i
had
struggled
to
bear
without
falling
they
laid
one
feather
too
much
my
voice
broke
you
devil
i
cried
at
him
you
dared
to
tell
raoul
that
opposite
on
her
narrow
little
seat
marianne
stirred
uneasily
till
now
our
tones
had
been
quiet
and
she
could
not
understand
one
word
we
said
she
is
the
soul
of
discretion
and
a
triumph
of
good
training
in
her
walk
of
life
but
she
loves
me
more
than
she
loves
any
other
creature
on
earth
and
now
she
could
see
and
hear
that
the
man
had
driven
me
to
the
brink
of
hysterics
she
would
have
liked
to
tear
his
face
with
her
nails
or
choke
him
i
think
if
i
had
given
her
the
word
i
believe
she
would
have
tried
with
all
her
strength
which
is
not
small
and
a
very
good
will
to
kill
him
i
was
dimly
conscious
of
what
her
restlessness
meant
and
vaguely
comforted
too
by
the
thought
of
her
supreme
loyalty
but
i
forgot
marianne
when
godensky
answered
my
question
yes
i
told
him
it
was
the
truth
and
i
always
understood
that
you
made
a
great
point
of
never
doing
anything
which
you
considered
in
the
least
risqué
so
why
should
i
suppose
you
would
rather
du
laurier
know
you
might
already
have
mentioned
it
to
him
he
would
believe
you
i
exclaimed
desperately
and
my
only
hope
was
that
i
might
be
right
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
seem
to
at
first
so
i
at
once
understood
that
you
had
spoken
of
our
appointment
but
it
was
too
late
to
atone
for
my
carelessness
and
i
did
the
next
best
thing
justified
my
veracity
i
suggested
that
if
he
did
take
my
word
for
it
he
might
stand
where
he
could
see
us
speaking
together
at
the
stage
door
and
ah
i
am
glad
of
that
i
cut
in
then
he
saw
that
we
did
drive
away
together
you
jump
at
conclusions
just
like
less
clever
women
i
hardly
thought
you
receive
me
into
your
carriage
at
the
theatre
so
i
took
the
precaution
of
warning
du
laurier
that
he
need
expect
to
see
that
you
would
suggest
a
place
for
me
to
meet
you
i
said
when
i
knew
it
i
would
inform
him
if
he
chose
to
wait
about
somewhere
for
a
few
minutes
raoul
du
laurier
would
scorn
to
spy
upon
me
i
broke
out
how
hard
you
are
on
spies
and
how
little
knowledge
of
human
nature
you
have
after
all
if
you
do
understand
that
a
man
suddenly
out
of
his
head
with
jealousy
will
do
things
of
which
he
be
incapable
when
he
was
sane
the
argument
silenced
me
i
knew
i
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
jealousy
could
rouse
a
demon
in
raoul
and
only
he
had
reminded
me
that
he
was
a
jealous
brute
i
remembered
what
answer
he
had
made
when
i
asked
him
what
he
would
do
if
i
deceived
him
he
said
that
he
would
kill
me
and
kill
himself
after
as
he
spoke
the
blood
had
streamed
up
to
his
forehead
and
streamed
back
again
leaving
him
pale
a
flash
like
steel
had
shot
out
of
his
eyes
the
dear
eyes
that
are
not
cold
it
was
true
as
this
cruel
wretch
reminded
me
raoul
would
do
things
under
the
torture
of
jealousy
that
he
would
cut
off
his
hand
sooner
than
do
when
his
own
sweet
was
in
ascendancy
as
a
proof
of
what
i
say
godensky
went
on
du
laurier
did
wait
did
hear
from
me
the
place
where
you
were
to
stop
and
pick
me
up
and
if
it
would
be
the
worst
of
form
to
bet
i
bet
that
he
found
some
way
of
getting
there
in
time
to
see
that
i
had
told
the
truth
you
coward
i
stammered
on
the
contrary
a
brave
man
i
heard
that
du
laurier
is
a
fine
shot
and
that
very
few
men
in
paris
can
touch
him
with
the
foils
so
you
see
you
want
to
frighten
me
i
exclaimed
you
misjudge
me
in
every
way
my
only
answer
was
to
tell
marianne
to
press
the
button
which
gives
the
signal
for
my
chauffeur
to
stop
instantly
the
electric
carriage
slowed
down
then
came
to
a
standstill
my
man
opened
the
door
and
count
godensky
submitted
to
my
will
nevertheless
he
was
far
from
being
in
a
submissive
mood
as
i
did
not
need
to
be
reminded
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
when
he
said
au
revoir
nothing
could
have
been
more
polite
than
the
words
or
his
way
of
speaking
them
as
he
stood
in
the
street
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
but
to
me
they
meant
a
threat
and
as
a
threat
they
were
intended
my
talk
with
godensky
at
the
stage
door
my
pause
to
pick
him
up
and
my
second
pause
to
set
him
down
had
all
taken
time
of
which
i
had
had
little
enough
at
the
starting
if
i
were
to
meet
ivor
dundas
when
he
arrived
it
was
two
or
three
minutes
after
midnight
or
so
my
watch
said
when
we
drew
up
before
the
gate
of
my
garden
in
the
quiet
rue
a
little
while
ago
i
had
been
ready
to
seize
upon
almost
any
expedient
for
keeping
raoul
away
from
my
house
but
now
after
what
i
had
just
heard
from
godensky
i
prayed
to
see
him
waiting
for
me
nobody
except
ivor
concerning
whom
i
given
orders
would
be
let
in
so
late
at
night
during
my
absence
not
even
raoul
himself
so
if
he
had
come
to
reproach
me
or
break
with
me
he
would
have
to
stand
outside
the
locked
gate
till
i
appeared
i
looked
for
him
longingly
but
he
was
not
there
there
was
to
be
sure
a
motor
brougham
in
the
street
for
a
wonder
usually
the
rue
is
as
empty
as
a
desert
after
eleven
but
a
girl
face
peered
out
at
me
from
the
window
an
impish
curiously
abnormal
little
face
it
was
extinguishing
the
spark
of
hope
that
sprang
to
life
as
i
caught
sight
of
the
carriage
it
was
standing
before
the
closed
gate
of
a
house
almost
opposite
mine
and
the
girl
seemed
somewhat
interested
in
me
but
i
was
not
at
all
interested
in
her
and
i
hate
being
stared
at
as
if
i
were
something
in
a
museum
the
gate
is
always
kept
locked
at
night
when
i
at
the
theatre
but
marianne
has
the
key
and
we
let
ourselves
in
when
we
come
for
only
old
henri
sits
up
and
he
is
growing
a
little
deaf
a
moment
and
we
were
inside
the
chauffeur
spinning
away
to
the
garage
usually
i
am
newly
delighted
every
night
with
my
quaint
old
house
and
its
small
but
pretty
garden
to
which
it
seems
delightful
to
come
home
after
hours
of
hard
work
at
the
theatre
but
though
a
cheerful
light
shone
out
from
between
the
drawn
curtains
of
the
salon
the
place
looked
inexpressibly
dreary
even
forbidding
to
me
i
felt
that
i
hated
the
house
though
i
had
chosen
it
after
a
long
search
for
peacefulness
and
privacy
how
gloomy
how
dead
was
the
street
beyond
the
high
wall
with
all
its
windows
closed
like
the
eyes
of
corpses
there
was
a
moist
depressing
smell
of
earth
after
rains
in
the
garden
no
wonder
the
place
had
been
to
let
at
a
bargain
for
a
long
term
there
had
been
a
murder
in
it
once
and
it
had
stood
empty
for
twelve
or
thirteen
of
the
fifteen
years
since
the
almost
forgotten
tragedy
i
had
been
the
tenant
for
two
years
now
before
i
became
a
star
with
a
theatre
of
my
own
in
paris
i
had
had
no
fear
of
the
ghost
said
to
haunt
the
house
indeed
i
remembered
thinking
and
saying
that
the
story
only
made
the
place
more
interesting
but
now
i
said
to
myself
that
i
wished
i
had
never
spoken
so
lightly
perhaps
the
ghost
had
brought
me
bad
luck
i
felt
as
if
the
murder
must
have
happened
on
just
such
a
still
brooding
damp
night
as
this
maybe
it
was
the
anniversary
if
i
only
knew
i
went
indoors
marianne
following
henri
very
thin
very
precise
withered
like
a
winter
apple
had
fallen
into
a
doze
in
the
hall
where
he
had
sat
hoping
to
hear
the
stopping
of
my
carriage
he
rose
up
bowing
and
blinking
just
as
he
had
done
often
before
and
would
often
again
if
life
were
to
go
on
for
me
in
the
old
way
he
regretted
not
having
heard
mademoiselle
would
mademoiselle
take
supper
no
mademoiselle
would
not
take
supper
she
wanted
nothing
and
henri
might
go
to
bed
i
thank
mademoiselle
when
i
have
closed
the
house
but
i
do
want
the
house
closed
i
said
i
shall
sit
up
for
awhile
it
hot
close
and
stuffy
i
may
like
to
have
the
windows
open
the
visitor
mademoiselle
expected
did
not
arrive
perhaps
if
he
comes
marianne
or
i
will
let
him
in
but
he
may
not
come
now
it
is
so
late
when
henri
had
gone
i
told
marianne
that
she
might
go
too
i
did
not
want
her
to
wait
if
the
person
i
had
expected
should
call
it
was
a
very
old
friend
in
fact
ivor
dundas
whom
marianne
must
remember
in
london
he
was
to
call
if
he
did
call
only
on
a
matter
of
business
which
would
take
but
a
few
minutes
to
get
through
and
possibly
he
would
not
even
come
into
the
house
if
the
rang
i
would
answer
it
myself
and
speak
with
dundas
perhaps
in
the
garden
then
i
would
let
him
out
and
come
straight
upstairs
marianne
might
go
to
bed
if
she
wished
i
do
not
wish
unless
mademoiselle
particularly
desires
me
to
do
so
said
she
i
do
not
rest
well
when
i
have
not
been
allowed
to
undress
mademoiselle
sit
up
then
in
your
own
room
and
wait
there
for
me
till
i
ring
for
you
i
replied
i
sha
be
late
whether
dundas
comes
or
come
supposing
the
should
ring
and
mademoiselle
should
go
yet
it
should
not
be
the
monsieur
she
expects
but
another
person
whom
she
would
not
care
to
admit
i
knew
of
what
she
was
thinking
and
of
whom
there
no
fear
of
that
no
fear
of
any
kind
i
answered
she
took
off
my
cloak
and
went
upstairs
reluctantly
carrying
my
jewel
box
i
walked
into
the
which
was
lighted
and
looked
very
bright
and
charming
with
its
many
flowers
and
framed
photographs
and
the
delightful
louis
quinze
furniture
which
i
had
so
enjoyed
picking
up
here
and
there
at
antique
shops
or
at
private
sales
i
flung
myself
on
the
sofa
but
i
could
not
rest
in
a
moment
i
was
up
again
moving
about
looking
at
the
clock
comparing
it
with
my
watch
wondering
what
could
have
happened
to
make
ivor
fail
in
keeping
his
promise
to
be
prompt
on
the
hour
of
twelve
of
course
a
hundred
harmless
things
might
have
kept
him
but
i
thought
only
of
the
worst
and
was
working
myself
up
to
a
frenzy
when
at
last
i
heard
the
i
had
been
in
the
house
no
more
than
twelve
or
fourteen
minutes
but
it
seemed
an
hour
and
i
gave
a
sob
of
relief
as
i
rushed
out
down
the
garden
path
to
let
my
visitor
in
fumbling
a
little
at
the
lock
always
a
little
difficult
if
one
were
in
a
hurry
i
asked
myself
what
if
as
marianne
had
suggested
it
were
not
ivor
dundas
but
someone
else
raoul
perhaps
or
the
man
who
had
been
in
her
mind
godensky
but
it
was
ivor
what
news
i
questioned
him
my
voice
sounding
queer
and
far
away
in
my
own
ears
i
do
know
whether
you
call
it
news
or
not
though
plenty
of
things
have
happened
i
awfully
sorry
to
be
late
i
would
let
him
finish
standing
there
but
took
him
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
into
the
garden
pushing
the
gate
shut
behind
him
as
i
did
so
yet
i
forgot
to
lock
it
and
naturally
it
did
not
occur
to
ivor
that
it
ought
to
be
fastened
once
inside
in
the
garden
i
was
going
to
make
him
begin
again
as
i
had
told
marianne
i
would
but
suddenly
i
bethought
myself
that
he
might
have
been
followed
that
there
might
be
watchers
behind
that
high
wall
watchers
who
would
try
to
be
listeners
too
and
whose
ears
would
be
very
different
from
old
henri
come
into
the
house
i
said
in
a
low
voice
before
you
begin
to
tell
anything
then
when
we
were
inside
i
could
not
even
wait
for
him
to
go
on
of
his
own
accord
and
in
his
own
way
the
treaty
i
asked
have
you
got
hold
of
it
unfortunately
no
but
you
heard
of
it
oh
you
heard
something
if
i
have
it
is
because
i
sat
down
and
waited
for
news
to
come
i
went
back
to
the
gare
du
nord
after
you
left
me
to
try
and
get
on
the
track
of
the
men
who
travelled
with
me
in
the
train
to
dover
but
i
was
sent
off
on
the
wrong
scent
and
wasted
a
lot
of
time
worse
luck
i
tell
you
about
it
later
if
you
care
to
hear
details
then
when
that
game
was
up
i
did
what
i
wish
i
done
at
first
found
out
and
consulted
a
private
detective
said
to
be
one
of
the
best
in
paris
you
told
your
story
story
to
a
detective
i
gasped
no
certainly
not
i
said
i
lost
something
of
value
given
me
by
a
lady
whose
name
i
could
bring
into
the
affair
i
was
george
sandford
too
not
dundas
i
described
my
travelling
companions
telling
all
that
happened
on
the
way
and
offered
big
pay
if
he
could
find
them
quickly
especially
the
little
fellow
he
held
out
hopes
of
spotting
them
so
do
be
desperate
my
poor
girl
the
detective
chap
seemed
really
to
think
he
not
have
much
difficulty
in
tracking
down
our
man
and
even
if
he
parted
with
the
treaty
we
can
find
out
what
he
done
with
it
no
doubt
girard
says
girard
i
caught
ivor
up
is
your
detective
name
anatole
girard
and
does
he
live
in
rue
du
capucin
blanc
yes
do
you
know
him
i
know
too
much
of
him
i
answered
bitterly
is
he
clever
after
all
far
too
clever
i
rather
you
had
gone
to
any
other
detective
in
paris
or
to
none
why
what
wrong
with
him
ivor
began
to
be
distressed
only
that
he
a
personal
friend
of
my
worst
enemy
the
man
i
spoke
of
to
you
this
evening
count
godensky
i
heard
so
from
godensky
himself
who
mentioned
the
acquaintance
once
when
girard
had
just
succeeded
in
a
case
everybody
was
talking
about
by
jove
what
a
beastly
coincidence
exclaimed
ivor
horribly
disappointed
at
having
done
exactly
the
wrong
thing
when
he
had
tried
so
hard
to
do
the
right
one
yet
how
could
i
have
dreamed
of
it
you
could
i
admitted
hopelessly
nothing
is
your
fault
all
that
happened
would
have
happened
just
the
same
no
matter
what
messenger
the
foreign
secretary
had
sent
to
me
it
fate
and
it
my
punishment
still
even
if
godensky
and
girard
are
friends
ivor
tried
to
console
me
it
is
likely
that
the
count
has
talked
to
the
detective
about
you
and
the
affair
of
the
treaty
he
may
have
gone
to
him
for
help
in
finding
out
things
he
could
find
out
himself
hardly
i
should
say
until
there
been
time
for
him
to
fear
failure
no
the
chances
are
that
girard
will
have
no
inner
knowledge
of
the
matter
i
put
into
his
hands
and
if
he
a
man
of
honour
he
bound
to
do
the
best
he
can
for
me
as
his
employer
have
you
seen
du
laurier
yes
at
the
theatre
nothing
bad
had
happened
to
him
yet
but
that
brute
godensky
has
made
dreadful
mischief
between
us
if
only
i
known
that
you
would
be
so
late
i
might
have
explained
everything
to
him
i
very
sorry
said
ivor
so
humbly
and
so
sadly
that
i
pitied
him
but
not
half
as
much
as
i
pitied
myself
even
though
i
had
forgotten
that
hint
he
had
let
drop
about
a
great
sacrifice
a
girl
he
loved
whom
he
had
thrown
over
somehow
to
come
to
me
i
made
every
effort
to
be
in
time
it
seems
a
piece
with
the
rest
of
my
horrible
luck
that
i
was
prevented
i
hope
at
least
that
du
laurier
knows
about
the
necklace
he
does
by
this
i
answered
yet
i
afraid
he
wo
be
in
a
mood
to
take
much
comfort
from
it
thanks
to
that
wretch
you
know
raoul
a
practical
bone
in
his
body
he
will
think
i
deceived
him
and
nothing
else
will
matter
i
must
but
i
broke
off
and
laid
my
hand
on
ivor
arm
what
that
i
whispered
did
you
hear
anything
then
ivor
shook
his
head
and
we
both
listened
it
a
step
outside
on
the
gravel
path
said
i
my
heart
beginning
to
knock
against
my
side
i
forgot
to
lock
the
gate
somebody
has
come
into
the
garden
what
if
it
should
be
raoul
what
if
he
has
seen
our
shadows
on
the
curtain
mechanically
we
moved
apart
ivor
making
a
gesture
to
reassure
me
on
account
of
the
position
of
the
lights
he
was
right
our
shadows
could
have
fallen
on
the
curtain
as
we
stood
listening
there
came
a
knock
at
the
front
door
it
was
raoul
knock
i
was
sure
of
that
if
only
ivor
had
arrived
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
at
the
time
appointed
i
should
have
hurried
him
away
before
this
so
that
i
might
write
to
raoul
but
now
i
could
not
think
what
to
do
for
the
best
what
to
do
that
things
might
not
be
made
far
worse
instead
of
better
between
raoul
and
me
i
had
suffered
so
much
that
my
power
of
quick
decision
on
which
i
so
often
prided
myself
vaingloriously
seemed
gone
it
is
raoul
i
said
what
shall
i
do
let
him
in
of
course
and
introduce
me
do
act
as
if
you
were
afraid
say
that
i
came
to
see
you
on
important
business
concerning
a
friend
of
yours
in
england
and
had
to
call
after
the
theatre
because
i
leaving
paris
by
the
first
train
in
the
morning
no
use
why
not
when
a
man
loves
a
woman
he
trusts
her
no
man
of
latin
blood
i
think
and
raoul
already
angry
he
has
the
right
to
be
or
would
have
if
godensky
had
been
telling
him
the
truth
and
i
refused
to
let
him
come
here
i
said
i
was
going
straight
to
bed
i
was
so
tired
he
knocking
again
hide
yourself
and
i
let
him
in
oh
do
you
stand
there
looking
at
me
like
that
go
into
that
room
and
i
pointed
then
pushed
him
towards
the
door
you
can
get
through
the
window
and
out
of
the
garden
softly
while
raoul
and
i
are
talking
if
you
insist
said
ivor
but
you
wrong
the
best
thing
go
go
i
tell
you
do
argue
i
know
best
i
cut
him
short
in
a
sharp
whisper
pushing
him
again
this
time
he
made
no
more
objections
but
went
into
the
adjoining
room
my
boudoir
the
key
was
in
the
door
i
turned
it
in
the
lock
snatched
it
out
and
dropped
it
into
a
bowl
of
flowers
on
a
table
close
by
that
done
i
flew
out
of
the
into
the
little
entrance
hall
and
opened
the
front
door
there
stood
raoul
his
face
dead
white
and
very
stern
in
the
light
of
the
hall
lamp
i
had
never
seen
him
like
that
before
i
know
why
you
here
i
began
quickly
before
he
could
speak
count
godensky
told
me
what
he
said
to
you
i
hoped
you
would
come
is
this
why
you
wished
to
know
what
i
would
do
if
you
deceived
me
he
asked
with
the
bitterest
reproach
in
eyes
and
voice
no
for
i
had
deceived
you
i
answered
i
have
deceived
you
now
if
you
loved
me
you
believe
me
raoul
i
put
out
my
hand
and
took
his
he
gave
mine
no
pressure
but
he
let
me
draw
him
into
the
house
for
god
sake
give
me
back
my
faith
in
you
if
you
can
he
said
it
death
to
lose
it
i
came
here
wanting
to
die
after
you
killed
me
as
you
said
perhaps
i
could
keep
away
i
had
to
come
if
you
have
any
explanation
for
the
love
of
heaven
tell
me
what
it
is
you
know
me
and
you
know
godensky
yet
you
need
an
explanation
of
anything
evil
said
of
me
by
him
in
this
way
i
hoped
to
disarm
raoul
but
he
had
been
i
think
and
was
scarcely
sane
now
such
a
power
had
jealousy
over
his
better
self
do
play
with
me
he
exclaimed
i
ca
bear
it
you
sent
me
away
yet
you
had
an
appointment
with
godensky
you
took
him
into
your
carriage
and
now
marianne
was
in
the
carriage
if
i
could
have
had
you
with
me
i
should
have
packed
her
off
by
herself
alone
that
i
might
be
alone
with
you
oh
raoul
it
is
you
believe
that
i
could
lie
to
you
for
godensky
sake
a
man
like
that
if
i
cared
for
him
why
should
i
have
accepted
him
instead
of
you
could
i
have
changed
so
quickly
do
you
think
i
do
think
i
not
able
to
think
i
can
only
feel
he
answered
then
feel
sure
that
i
love
you
no
man
but
you
now
and
always
oh
maxine
he
stammered
am
i
a
fool
or
wise
to
let
myself
believe
you
you
are
wise
i
answered
as
firmly
as
if
i
deserved
the
full
faith
i
was
claiming
from
him
as
my
right
if
you
would
believe
without
my
insisting
without
my
explaining
and
defending
myself
i
tell
you
nothing
but
you
believe
just
because
you
love
me
i
see
it
in
your
face
and
thank
god
for
it
so
i
tell
you
this
count
godensky
hates
me
because
i
could
and
would
love
him
and
he
hates
you
because
he
thinks
i
love
you
he
i
paused
for
a
second
a
wild
thought
had
flashed
like
the
light
of
a
beacon
in
my
brain
if
i
could
say
something
now
which
when
the
blow
fell
if
it
did
fall
might
come
back
to
raoul
mind
and
convince
him
instantly
that
it
was
godensky
not
i
who
had
stolen
the
treaty
and
broken
him
if
i
could
make
him
believe
the
whole
thing
a
monstrous
plot
of
godensky
to
revenge
himself
on
a
woman
who
refused
him
by
cleverly
implicating
her
in
her
lover
ruin
by
throwing
guilt
upon
her
while
she
was
in
reality
innocent
if
i
could
suggest
that
to
raoul
now
while
his
ears
were
open
i
might
hold
his
love
against
the
world
no
matter
what
happened
afterward
it
was
a
mad
idea
and
a
wicked
one
perhaps
but
i
was
at
my
wits
end
and
desperate
though
not
guilty
of
this
one
crime
which
i
would
shift
upon
his
shoulders
if
i
could
as
a
means
of
escaping
from
the
trap
helped
to
set
godensky
was
capable
of
it
and
guilty
of
others
i
was
sure
which
had
never
been
brought
home
to
him
i
believed
that
he
too
was
a
spy
just
as
i
was
and
far
worse
because
if
he
were
one
he
betrayed
his
own
country
while
i
never
had
done
that
never
would
all
these
thoughts
rushed
through
my
head
in
a
second
and
i
think
that
raoul
could
hardly
have
noticed
the
pause
before
i
began
to
speak
again
he
godensky
would
do
anything
to
part
you
and
me
i
said
no
plot
too
sly
and
vile
for
him
to
conceive
and
carry
out
against
me
and
you
no
lie
too
base
for
him
to
tell
you
or
others
about
me
he
sent
me
a
letter
at
the
theatre
soon
after
you
left
me
the
first
time
in
it
he
said
that
i
must
give
him
a
few
minutes
after
the
play
unless
i
wanted
some
dreadful
harm
to
come
to
something
concerning
your
career
that
frightened
me
though
i
might
have
guessed
it
was
only
a
trick
indeed
i
did
guess
but
i
could
be
sure
so
i
saw
him
i
did
want
you
to
know
i
tell
you
that
frankly
raoul
because
i
told
you
not
to
come
home
with
me
i
hoped
you
would
find
out
that
i
meant
to
let
count
godensky
drive
part
of
the
way
back
with
me
and
marianne
i
ran
the
risk
and
the
very
thing
happened
which
i
ought
to
have
known
would
happen
as
for
what
he
had
to
tell
me
it
was
nothing
only
vague
hints
of
trouble
from
which
he
as
one
of
an
inner
circle
might
save
you
if
i
would
be
grateful
enough
the
scoundrel
broke
out
raoul
convinced
now
his
eyes
blazing
i
he
stopped
suddenly
but
i
knew
what
had
been
on
his
lips
to
say
he
meant
to
send
a
challenge
to
count
godensky
i
must
prevent
him
from
doing
that
no
raoul
i
said
as
if
he
had
finished
his
sentence
you
fight
for
my
sake
you
must
do
you
see
it
just
what
he
like
best
it
would
be
a
way
of
doing
me
the
most
dreadful
injury
think
of
the
scandal
oh
you
think
of
it
when
you
cooler
for
you
i
would
not
fear
much
for
i
know
what
a
swordsman
you
are
and
what
a
shot
far
superior
to
godensky
and
with
right
on
your
side
but
i
would
fear
for
myself
promise
you
wo
bring
this
trouble
upon
me
i
promise
he
answered
oh
my
darling
what
would
i
promise
you
to
atone
for
my
brutal
injustice
to
an
angel
how
thankful
i
am
that
i
came
to
you
i
meant
not
to
come
i
was
afraid
of
myself
and
what
i
might
do
but
at
last
i
could
hold
out
against
the
something
that
seemed
forcing
me
here
in
spite
of
all
resistance
do
you
forgive
me
as
a
reward
for
your
promise
i
said
smiling
at
him
through
tears
that
would
come
because
i
was
worn
out
and
because
i
knew
that
it
was
i
who
needed
his
forgiveness
not
he
mine
now
are
you
happy
again
i
asked
yes
i
happy
he
said
though
on
the
way
to
this
house
i
dream
that
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
know
happiness
any
more
in
this
world
and
even
at
your
gate
he
stopped
suddenly
and
his
face
changed
i
waited
an
instant
but
seeing
that
he
did
mean
to
go
on
i
could
not
resist
questioning
him
i
had
to
know
what
had
happened
at
my
gate
even
at
the
gate
what
i
asked
nothing
i
sorry
i
spoke
i
want
to
show
you
how
completely
i
trust
you
now
by
not
speaking
of
that
but
this
reticence
of
his
only
made
me
more
anxious
to
hear
what
he
had
been
going
to
say
i
was
afraid
that
i
could
guess
but
i
must
have
it
from
his
lips
and
be
able
to
explain
away
the
mystery
which
when
it
recurred
to
him
in
the
future
might
make
him
doubt
me
even
though
in
this
moment
of
exaltation
he
did
not
doubt
yes
speak
of
it
i
said
all
the
more
because
it
is
nothing
for
it
be
nothing
i
want
to
punish
myself
for
asking
an
explanation
about
godensky
by
not
allowing
you
to
explain
this
other
thing
insisted
poor
loyal
repentant
raoul
then
at
the
time
it
made
all
the
rest
seem
worse
a
thousand
times
worse
but
i
saw
through
black
spectacles
now
i
see
through
ones
i
rather
you
saw
through
your
own
dear
eyes
without
any
spectacles
you
must
tell
me
what
you
thinking
of
dear
for
my
own
sake
if
not
yours
well
if
you
will
know
but
remember
darling
i
going
to
put
it
out
of
my
mind
i
ask
you
no
questions
i
only
tell
you
the
thing
itself
as
i
said
i
did
come
here
directly
after
seeing
godensky
get
into
your
carriage
i
wandered
about
like
a
madman
and
i
thought
of
the
seine
oh
you
must
indeed
have
been
mad
i
was
but
that
something
saved
me
the
something
that
drove
me
to
find
you
i
walked
here
by
roundabout
ways
but
always
coming
nearer
and
nearer
as
if
being
drawn
into
a
whirlpool
at
last
i
was
in
this
street
on
the
side
opposite
your
house
i
had
made
up
my
mind
yet
that
i
would
try
to
see
you
i
did
know
what
i
would
do
i
stood
still
and
tried
to
think
it
was
very
black
in
the
angle
between
two
garden
walls
where
the
big
plane
tree
sprouts
up
you
know
nobody
who
did
expect
to
find
a
man
would
have
noticed
me
in
the
darkness
i
had
been
there
for
two
minutes
when
a
man
turned
the
corner
walking
very
fast
as
he
passed
the
street
lamp
just
before
reaching
the
garden
wall
i
saw
him
plainly
not
his
face
but
his
figure
and
he
was
young
and
well
dressed
in
travelling
clothes
i
thought
he
looked
like
an
englishman
he
went
straight
to
your
gate
and
rang
a
moment
later
someone
i
could
see
who
opened
the
gate
and
let
him
in
involuntarily
i
took
a
step
forward
with
the
idea
of
following
of
pushing
my
way
in
to
see
who
he
was
and
who
had
opened
the
gate
but
i
was
quite
mad
enough
to
act
like
a
cad
the
gate
shut
oh
maxine
there
were
evil
and
cruel
thoughts
in
my
mind
i
confess
it
to
you
but
how
they
made
me
suffer
i
stood
as
if
i
were
turned
to
stone
and
i
only
wished
that
i
might
be
for
a
stone
knows
no
pain
just
then
a
motor
cab
going
slowly
along
the
street
stopped
in
front
of
your
gate
there
were
two
women
in
it
i
could
see
them
by
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
though
not
as
plainly
as
i
seen
the
man
and
they
appeared
to
be
arguing
very
excitedly
about
something
whatever
it
was
it
must
have
been
in
some
way
concerned
with
you
or
your
affairs
because
they
were
tremendously
interested
in
the
house
they
both
looked
out
and
one
pointed
several
times
even
if
i
intended
to
go
in
i
would
have
gone
while
they
were
there
but
the
very
fact
that
they
there
roused
me
out
of
the
kind
of
lethargy
of
misery
i
fallen
into
i
wondered
who
they
were
and
if
they
meant
you
harm
or
good
when
they
had
driven
away
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
see
you
if
i
could
i
tried
the
gate
and
found
it
unlocked
i
walked
in
and
there
were
lights
in
these
windows
i
knew
you
could
have
gone
to
bed
yet
though
you
said
you
were
so
tired
there
was
death
in
my
heart
then
for
you
and
for
me
maxine
for
the
gate
had
opened
again
and
i
know
what
you
thought
i
broke
in
my
heart
beating
so
now
that
my
voice
shook
a
little
though
i
struggled
to
seem
calm
you
said
to
yourself
was
maxine
who
let
the
man
in
he
is
with
her
now
i
shall
find
them
together
yes
raoul
admitted
but
i
did
try
the
handle
of
the
door
as
i
had
of
the
gate
i
rang
i
could
bring
myself
to
take
you
unawares
do
you
think
still
that
i
let
a
man
in
and
hid
him
when
i
heard
you
ring
i
asked
for
an
instant
i
was
inclined
to
tell
the
story
ivor
had
advised
me
to
tell
but
i
saw
how
excited
raoul
was
i
saw
how
in
painting
the
picture
for
me
he
lived
through
the
scene
again
and
in
spite
of
himself
suffered
almost
as
keenly
as
he
had
suffered
in
the
experience
i
saw
how
his
suspicions
of
me
came
crawling
into
his
heart
though
he
strove
to
lash
them
back
i
dared
not
bring
ivor
out
from
the
other
room
if
he
were
still
there
he
was
too
handsome
too
young
too
attractive
in
every
way
if
raoul
had
been
jealous
of
count
godensky
whom
he
knew
i
had
refused
what
would
he
feel
towards
ivor
dundas
a
stranger
whose
name
i
had
never
mentioned
though
he
was
received
at
my
house
after
midnight
i
was
thankful
i
had
taken
ivor
advice
and
introduced
the
two
men
at
first
for
in
his
then
mood
raoul
would
have
listened
to
no
explanations
he
and
i
would
never
have
arrived
at
the
understanding
we
had
reached
now
and
not
having
been
frank
at
first
i
must
be
secret
to
the
end
the
very
asking
of
such
a
bold
question
do
you
think
i
let
a
man
in
and
hid
him
helped
my
cause
with
raoul
no
he
said
i
ca
think
it
i
wo
and
do
think
it
and
you
need
tell
me
nothing
i
love
you
and
so
help
me
god
i
wo
distrust
you
again
just
as
it
entered
my
mind
to
risk
everything
on
the
chance
that
ivor
had
by
this
time
found
his
way
out
i
heard
or
fancied
i
heard
a
faint
sound
in
the
next
room
he
was
there
still
instead
of
throwing
open
the
door
as
it
had
occurred
to
me
to
do
saying
let
us
look
for
the
man
and
make
sure
no
one
else
let
him
in
i
laughed
out
abruptly
as
if
on
a
sudden
thought
but
really
to
cover
the
sound
if
it
should
come
again
oh
raoul
i
exclaimed
in
the
midst
of
the
laughter
with
which
i
surprised
him
you
taking
this
too
seriously
a
thousand
times
i
thank
you
for
trusting
me
in
spite
of
appearances
but
after
all
they
so
much
against
me
you
seem
to
think
i
am
the
only
young
woman
in
this
house
marianne
poor
dear
is
old
enough
it
true
but
i
have
a
de
and
a
both
under
both
pretty
and
both
engaged
to
be
married
this
was
true
ah
what
a
comfort
to
speak
the
truth
to
him
does
it
occur
to
you
that
at
this
very
moment
a
couple
of
lovers
may
be
sitting
hand
in
hand
on
the
seat
under
the
old
yew
arbour
ca
you
imagine
how
they
started
and
tried
to
hold
their
breath
lest
you
should
hear
as
you
opened
the
gate
and
came
up
the
path
forgive
me
murmured
raoul
in
the
depths
of
remorse
again
shall
we
go
and
look
or
shall
we
leave
them
in
peace
leave
them
in
peace
by
all
means
the
man
will
be
slipping
away
soon
no
doubt
both
thérèse
and
annette
are
good
little
girls
do
let
bother
about
them
you
will
be
sending
me
away
soon
too
and
i
shall
deserve
it
brute
that
i
am
you
were
so
tired
and
i
oh
i
better
now
i
said
of
course
i
must
send
you
away
by
and
by
but
not
quite
yet
first
i
want
to
ask
if
you
were
glad
when
you
saw
the
jewels
jewels
echoed
raoul
what
jewels
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
yet
opened
the
little
bag
i
gave
you
at
the
theatre
i
exclaimed
raoul
looked
half
ashamed
dearest
do
think
me
ungrateful
he
said
but
before
i
had
a
chance
to
open
it
i
met
godensky
and
he
told
me
that
lie
it
lit
a
fire
in
my
brain
i
forgot
all
about
the
bag
and
have
thought
of
it
again
till
this
minute
at
last
i
laughed
with
sincerity
oh
raoul
raoul
you
not
fit
for
this
world
well
i
glad
after
all
that
i
shall
be
with
you
when
you
see
what
that
little
insignificant
bag
which
forgotten
all
this
tune
has
in
it
take
it
out
of
your
pocket
and
open
it
together
for
the
moment
i
was
almost
happy
and
that
raoul
would
be
happy
i
knew
his
hand
went
to
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
into
which
i
had
seen
him
put
the
brocade
bag
but
it
did
not
come
out
again
it
groped
and
his
face
flushed
good
heavens
maxine
he
said
i
hope
you
were
in
earnest
when
you
told
me
that
bag
held
something
very
valuable
to
us
both
for
i
lost
it
you
know
i
been
almost
mad
i
had
my
handkerchief
in
that
pocket
i
must
have
pulled
it
out
and
my
knees
seemed
to
give
way
under
me
i
half
fell
onto
a
sofa
raoul
i
said
in
a
queer
stifled
voice
the
bag
had
in
it
the
duchess
de
montpellier
diamonds
ivor
dundas
part
chapter
xii
ivor
goes
into
the
dark
never
had
i
been
caught
in
a
situation
which
i
liked
less
than
finding
myself
long
after
midnight
locked
by
maxine
de
renzie
into
her
boudoir
while
within
hearing
she
did
her
best
to
convince
her
lover
that
no
stranger
had
come
on
her
account
to
the
house
i
had
never
before
visited
her
in
paris
though
she
had
described
her
little
place
there
to
me
when
we
knew
each
other
in
london
and
in
groping
about
trying
to
find
another
door
or
a
window
in
the
dark
room
i
ran
constant
risks
of
making
my
presence
known
by
stumbling
against
the
furniture
or
knocking
down
some
ornament
i
dared
not
strike
a
match
because
of
the
sharp
rasping
noise
it
would
make
and
i
had
to
be
as
cautious
as
if
i
were
treading
with
bare
feet
on
glass
although
i
knew
that
maxine
was
praying
for
me
to
be
out
of
the
house
and
i
was
as
far
from
wishing
to
linger
as
she
was
to
have
me
stay
only
by
a
miracle
did
i
save
myself
once
or
twice
from
upsetting
a
chair
or
a
tall
vase
of
flowers
on
my
way
to
a
second
door
which
was
locked
on
the
other
side
at
last
however
i
discovered
a
window
and
congratulated
myself
that
my
trouble
and
maxine
danger
was
nearly
over
the
room
being
on
the
ground
floor
though
rather
high
above
the
level
of
the
garden
i
thought
that
i
could
easily
let
myself
down
but
when
i
had
slipped
behind
the
heavy
curtains
they
were
drawn
and
felt
smooth
like
satin
it
was
only
to
come
upon
a
new
difficulty
the
window
which
opened
in
the
middle
like
most
french
windows
was
tightly
closed
with
the
catch
securely
fastened
and
as
i
began
slowly
and
with
infinite
caution
to
turn
the
handle
i
felt
that
the
window
was
going
to
stick
perhaps
the
wood
had
been
freshly
painted
perhaps
it
had
swelled
in
any
case
i
knew
that
when
the
two
sashes
consented
to
part
they
would
make
a
loud
protest
after
the
first
warning
squeak
i
stopped
in
the
next
room
maxine
raised
her
voice
to
cover
the
sound
i
was
sure
then
it
had
been
worse
even
than
i
fancied
i
dared
not
begin
again
i
would
grope
about
once
more
and
see
if
i
could
hit
upon
some
other
way
out
which
possibly
i
had
missed
no
there
was
nothing
no
other
window
except
a
small
one
which
apparently
communicated
with
a
pantry
and
even
if
that
had
not
seemed
too
small
for
me
to
climb
through
it
was
fastened
on
the
pantry
side
what
to
do
i
did
not
know
it
would
be
a
calamity
for
maxine
if
du
laurier
should
hear
a
sound
and
insist
on
having
the
door
opened
after
she
had
given
him
the
impression
if
she
had
not
said
it
in
so
many
words
that
there
was
no
stranger
in
the
house
probably
she
hoped
that
by
this
time
i
was
gone
but
how
could
i
go
i
felt
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
and
if
i
had
been
a
nervous
woman
i
should
have
imagined
myself
stifling
in
the
small
hot
room
with
its
closed
doors
and
windows
as
it
was
i
was
uncomfortable
enough
my
forehead
grew
damp
as
in
the
first
moments
of
a
turkish
bath
and
absent
mindedly
i
felt
in
pocket
after
pocket
for
my
handkerchief
it
was
not
to
be
found
i
must
have
lost
it
at
the
hotel
or
the
detective
or
in
the
automobile
i
had
hired
in
an
outside
pocket
of
my
coat
however
i
chanced
upon
something
for
the
existence
of
which
i
could
account
it
was
a
very
small
something
only
a
bit
of
paper
but
a
very
neatly
folded
bit
of
paper
and
i
remembered
how
it
had
fallen
from
my
pocket
onto
the
floor
and
a
gendarme
had
picked
it
up
at
ordinary
times
i
should
most
likely
not
have
given
it
a
second
thought
but
nothing
unexpected
could
be
dismissed
as
insignificant
until
it
had
been
thoroughly
examined
i
put
the
paper
back
and
as
i
did
so
i
heard
maxine
give
an
exclamation
apparently
of
distress
i
could
not
distinguish
all
she
said
but
i
thought
that
i
caught
the
word
diamonds
for
a
moment
or
two
she
and
du
laurier
talked
together
so
excitedly
that
i
might
have
made
another
attack
on
the
window
without
great
risk
and
i
was
meditating
the
attempt
when
suddenly
the
voices
ceased
a
door
opened
and
shut
there
was
dead
silence
except
for
a
footfall
overhead
which
sounded
heavier
than
maxine
perhaps
it
was
her
maid
for
a
few
seconds
more
i
stood
still
awaiting
developments
but
there
was
no
sound
in
the
next
room
and
i
decided
to
take
my
chance
before
it
should
be
too
late
i
jerked
at
the
window
which
yielded
with
a
loud
squeak
that
would
certainly
have
given
away
the
secret
of
my
presence
if
there
had
been
ears
to
hear
but
all
was
still
in
the
adjoining
and
i
dropped
down
on
to
a
flower
bed
some
few
feet
below
then
i
skirted
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
walking
stealthily
on
the
soft
grass
and
would
have
made
a
noiseless
dash
for
the
gate
had
i
not
seen
a
stream
of
light
flowing
out
through
the
open
front
door
across
the
lawn
i
checked
myself
just
in
time
to
draw
back
without
being
seen
by
a
woman
and
a
tall
man
moving
slowly
down
the
path
they
were
maxine
and
no
doubt
du
laurier
they
spoke
not
a
word
but
walked
with
their
heads
bent
as
if
deeply
absorbed
in
searching
for
something
on
the
ground
down
to
the
gate
they
went
opened
it
and
passed
out
only
half
closing
it
behind
them
so
that
i
knew
they
meant
presently
to
come
back
again
i
should
have
been
thankful
to
escape
but
the
chance
of
meeting
them
was
too
imminent
accordingly
i
waited
and
it
was
well
i
did
for
as
they
reappeared
in
three
or
four
minutes
they
could
not
have
gone
far
enough
to
be
out
of
sight
from
the
gate
there
witchcraft
in
it
maxine
said
as
she
and
her
lover
passed
within
a
few
yards
of
me
where
i
hid
behind
a
little
arbour
du
laurier
answer
was
lost
to
me
but
his
voice
sounded
despondent
evidently
they
had
mislaid
something
of
importance
and
had
small
hope
of
finding
it
again
i
could
not
help
being
curious
as
well
as
sorry
for
maxine
that
a
further
misfortune
should
have
befallen
her
at
such
a
time
but
the
one
and
only
way
in
which
i
could
help
her
at
the
moment
was
to
get
away
as
soon
as
possible
they
had
left
the
gate
unlocked
and
i
drew
in
a
long
breath
of
relief
when
i
was
on
the
other
side
i
hurried
out
of
the
street
lest
du
laurier
should
by
any
chance
follow
on
quickly
and
my
first
thought
was
to
go
immediately
back
to
my
hotel
where
girard
might
by
now
have
arrived
with
news
i
was
just
ready
to
hail
a
cab
crawling
by
at
a
distance
when
i
remembered
the
bit
of
paper
i
found
and
put
back
into
my
pocket
it
occurred
to
me
to
have
a
look
at
it
by
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
near
by
and
the
instant
i
had
straightened
out
the
small
crumpled
wad
i
guessed
that
here
was
a
link
in
the
mystery
the
paper
was
a
leaf
torn
from
a
and
closely
covered
on
both
sides
with
small
uneven
writing
done
with
a
sharp
black
pencil
the
handwriting
was
that
of
an
uneducated
person
and
was
strange
to
me
i
could
not
make
out
the
words
by
the
light
of
the
tall
lamp
so
i
lit
a
wax
match
from
my
and
protecting
the
flame
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
began
studying
the
strange
message
the
three
first
words
sent
my
heart
up
with
a
bound
on
board
the
i
had
crossed
the
channel
in
the
queen
and
this
beginning
alone
was
enough
to
make
me
hope
that
the
bit
of
paper
might
do
more
than
any
detective
to
unravel
the
mystery
i
taking
big
risks
because
i
got
to
i
read
on
it
my
only
chance
and
if
you
find
this
i
bet
i
can
trust
you
a
gentleman
and
you
saved
my
life
and
a
lot
more
besides
by
getting
into
that
when
the
other
chaps
did
the
minute
i
seen
them
i
thot
i
was
done
for
but
you
stopped
there
game
i
a
jewler
assistant
carrying
property
worth
thousands
for
my
employers
from
the
first
i
knew
was
bound
to
be
a
ticklish
job
on
this
bote
i
safe
for
the
villions
who
would
have
murdered
and
robbed
me
in
the
train
if
it
been
for
you
being
there
wo
have
a
chance
but
when
i
get
to
paris
it
will
be
the
worst
and
no
hope
for
the
jewls
followed
as
i
am
if
i
had
already
thot
of
a
plan
to
save
them
through
you
an
honest
gentleman
far
above
temptashun
i
know
who
you
are
for
i
seen
your
photo
in
the
papers
so
what
i
did
was
this
to
try
a
ventriloquist
trick
which
has
offen
bin
of
use
in
my
carere
just
as
folks
were
on
the
boat
gangway
making
that
disturbance
and
a
little
skill
i
have
got
by
doing
amatoor
conjuring
to
amuse
my
wife
and
famly
i
was
able
to
slip
the
case
of
my
employer
jewls
into
your
breast
pocket
without
your
knowing
and
i
had
to
take
away
what
you
had
in
not
that
i
wanted
to
rob
one
who
had
done
good
by
me
but
because
if
left
it
the
double
thickness
would
have
surprised
you
and
you
would
probably
have
pulled
out
my
case
to
see
what
it
was
then
my
fat
would
have
bin
in
the
fire
with
certin
persons
looking
on
and
you
in
danger
as
well
as
me
which
would
be
fare
got
your
case
in
my
pocket
as
i
write
but
i
wo
open
it
because
it
may
have
your
sweetart
letters
in
you
can
get
your
property
again
by
bringing
me
my
master
which
is
fare
exchange
i
ca
call
on
you
for
i
do
know
where
your
going
and
dare
hang
round
to
see
on
account
of
the
danger
i
run
and
needing
to
meet
a
pal
of
mine
who
will
help
me
i
must
get
to
him
at
once
if
i
am
spared
to
do
so
for
which
reason
i
wrote
out
this
explanashun
the
best
i
can
do
is
to
slip
it
in
your
pocket
which
i
shall
try
when
in
the
railway
stashun
at
paris
you
see
how
i
trust
you
as
a
gentleman
to
bring
me
the
jewls
come
as
soon
as
you
can
and
get
your
own

sake

for

of
gestre
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
rage
at
not
having
read
this
illuminating
little
document
earlier
i
should
have
felt
like
shouting
with
joy
as
it
was
my
delight
was
tempered
with
enough
of
regret
to
make
it
easier
to
restrain
myself
but
for
the
fear
that
du
laurier
might
be
still
with
maxine
i
should
have
rushed
back
to
her
house
for
a
moment
just
long
enough
to
give
her
the
good
news
but
in
the
circumstances
i
dared
not
do
it
lest
she
should
curse
instead
of
bless
me
and
besides
as
there
was
still
a
chance
of
disappointment
it
might
be
better
in
any
case
not
to
raise
her
hopes
until
there
was
no
danger
of
dashing
them
again
the
best
thing
was
to
get
the
treaty
back
without
a
second
of
delay
as
for
the
detective
who
was
perhaps
waiting
for
me
at
the
hotel
he
would
have
to
wait
longer
or
even
go
away
disgusted
nothing
made
much
difference
now
maybe
when
once
i
had
the
treaty
in
my
hands
i
might
send
a
messenger
with
a
few
cautious
words
to
maxine
no
matter
how
late
the
hour
she
was
certain
not
to
be
asleep
the
cab
i
had
seen
crawling
through
the
street
had
disappeared
long
ago
and
no
other
was
in
sight
so
i
walked
quickly
on
hoping
to
find
one
presently
it
was
now
so
late
however
that
in
this
quiet
part
of
paris
no
carriages
of
any
sort
were
plying
for
hire
finally
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
should
have
to
go
all
the
way
on
foot
but
i
knew
the
direction
of
the
avenue
morot
though
i
never
heard
of
rue
de
la
fille
sauvage
and
as
it
was
not
more
than
two
miles
to
walk
i
could
reach
the
house
i
wanted
to
find
in
half
an
hour
a
few
minutes
more
or
less
ought
not
to
matter
much
since
was
sure
to
be
awaiting
me
with
impatience
therefore
the
thing
which
bothered
me
most
was
the
effect
likely
to
be
produced
on
the
man
when
i
could
not
hand
him
over
the
diamonds
in
exchange
for
the
treaty
of
course
i
did
believe
that
was
a
jeweller
messenger
though
possibly
i
might
have
been
less
incredulous
if
maxine
had
not
told
me
the
true
history
of
the
diamonds
and
what
had
happened
in
holland
as
it
was
i
had
very
little
doubt
that
the
rat
of
a
man
i
had
chanced
to
protect
in
the
railway
carriage
was
no
other
than
the
extraordinarily
expert
thief
who
had
relieved
du
laurier
of
the
duchess
necklace
following
out
a
theory
which
i
worked
up
as
i
walked
i
thought
it
probable
that
the
fellow
had
been
helped
by
confederates
whom
he
had
contrived
to
dodge
evading
them
and
sneaking
off
to
london
in
the
hope
of
cheating
them
out
of
their
share
of
the
spoil
followed
by
them
dreading
their
vengeance
i
fancied
him
flitting
from
one
to
another
not
daring
to
separate
himself
from
the
jewels
at
last
determining
to
escape
disguised
from
england
where
the
scent
had
become
too
hot
reserving
a
carriage
in
the
train
to
dover
and
travelling
with
a
golfer
kit
struck
with
panic
at
the
last
moment
on
seeing
the
very
men
he
fled
to
avoid
close
on
his
heels
and
opening
the
door
of
his
reserved
carriage
with
a
railway
key
all
this
was
merely
deduction
for
so
far
as
i
had
seen
travelling
companions
had
even
accosted
him
still
the
theory
accounted
for
much
that
had
been
puzzling
and
made
it
plausible
that
a
man
should
be
desperate
enough
to
trust
his
treasure
to
a
stranger
known
only
through
photos
in
the
newspapers
rather
than
risk
losing
it
to
those
he
had
betrayed
i
resolved
to
use
all
my
powers
of
diplomacy
to
extract
from
the
case
containing
the
treaty
before
he
learned
that
he
was
not
to
receive
the
diamonds
in
its
place
and
i
had
no
more
than
vaguely
mapped
out
a
plan
of
proceeding
before
i
arrived
in
the
avenue
morot
thence
i
soon
found
my
way
into
the
rue
de
la
fille
sauvage
a
mean
street
to
which
the
queer
name
seemed
not
inappropriate
the
house
i
had
to
visit
was
an
ugly
big
box
of
a
building
with
rooms
advertised
to
let
as
i
could
see
by
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
across
the
way
which
gleamed
bleakly
on
the
lines
of
shut
windows
behind
narrow
iron
balconies
the
large
double
doors
from
which
the
paint
had
peeled
in
patches
were
closed
but
i
rang
the
bell
for
the
concierge
and
after
a
delay
of
several
minutes
i
heard
a
slight
click
which
meant
that
the
doors
had
opened
for
me
i
passed
into
a
dim
lobby
to
be
challenged
by
a
sleepy
voice
behind
a
half
open
window
the
owner
of
the
voice
kept
himself
invisible
and
was
no
doubt
in
the
bunk
which
he
called
his
bed
only
a
stern
sense
of
duty
as
concierge
woke
him
up
enough
to
demand
mechanically
who
it
was
that
the
strange
monsieur
desired
to
visit
at
this
late
hour
i
replied
according
to
instructions
i
wished
to
see
monsieur
gestre
monsieur
gestre
is
away
murmured
the
voice
behind
the
little
window
i
thought
quickly
gestre
was
probably
the
pal
whom
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
find
very
well
said
i
i
see
his
friend
the
englishman
who
arrived
this
evening
i
have
an
appointment
with
him
ah
i
understand
i
remember
is
it
not
that
monsieur
has
been
here
already
he
now
returns
as
he
mentioned
that
he
might
do
again
my
thoughts
made
haste
to
arrange
themselves
the
monsieur
who
had
called
had
probably
also
arrived
late
after
the
concierge
had
gone
to
bed
in
his
dim
box
and
become
too
drowsy
to
notice
such
details
as
the
difference
between
voices
especially
if
they
were
those
of
foreigners
perhaps
if
i
explained
that
i
was
not
the
person
who
had
said
he
would
come
again
but
another
the
man
behind
the
window
would
consider
me
a
complication
and
refuse
to
let
me
pass
at
such
an
hour
without
a
fuss
and
of
all
things
a
fuss
was
what
i
least
wanted
for
maxine
sake
and
because
of
the
treaty
i
decided
to
seize
upon
the
advantage
that
was
offered
me
quite
right
i
said
shortly
i
know
the
way
and
so
began
to
mount
the
stairs
flight
after
flight
i
went
up
meeting
no
one
and
on
the
fifth
floor
i
found
that
i
had
reached
the
top
of
the
house
there
were
no
more
stairs
to
go
up
on
each
of
the
floors
below
there
had
been
a
dim
light
a
jet
of
gas
turned
low
but
the
fifth
floor
was
in
darkness
someone
had
put
out
the
light
either
in
carelessness
or
for
some
special
reason
there
were
several
doors
on
each
side
of
the
passage
but
i
could
not
be
sure
that
i
had
reached
the
right
one
until
i
lighted
a
match
when
i
was
sure
i
knocked
but
no
answer
came
he
ca
be
out
i
said
to
myself
cheerfully
he
got
tired
of
waiting
and
dropped
asleep
that
all
i
knocked
again
silence
and
then
for
a
third
time
loudly
keeping
on
until
i
was
sure
that
if
there
were
anyone
in
the
room
no
matter
how
sound
asleep
i
must
have
waked
him
after
all
he
had
gone
out
but
perhaps
only
for
a
short
time
surely
he
would
soon
come
back
lest
he
should
miss
the
keeper
of
the
diamonds
i
had
very
little
hope
that
even
on
the
chance
of
my
arriving
while
he
was
away
he
would
have
left
the
door
open
nevertheless
i
tried
the
handle
and
to
my
surprise
it
yielded
that
must
be
because
the
lock
broken
and
only
a
bolt
remains
i
thought
so
he
had
to
take
the
risk
all
the
better
this
looks
as
if
he
be
back
any
minute
he
would
like
giving
the
enemy
a
chance
to
find
his
lair
and
step
into
it
before
him
it
was
dark
in
the
room
and
i
struck
another
wax
match
just
inside
the
threshold
but
i
had
hardly
time
to
get
an
impression
of
bareness
and
meanness
of
furnishing
before
a
draught
of
air
from
an
open
window
blew
out
the
struggling
flame
and
at
the
same
instant
banged
the
door
shut
behind
me
chapter
xiii
ivor
finds
something
in
the
dark
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
paraffin
oil
in
the
room
and
from
somewhere
at
the
far
end
came
a
faint
tap
tapping
sound
which
might
be
the
light
knocking
of
a
or
the
rap
of
a
signalling
finger
if
i
could
steer
my
way
to
the
window
and
pull
back
the
drawn
curtains
i
might
be
able
to
let
in
light
enough
to
find
matches
on
mantelpiece
or
table
then
what
good
luck
if
i
should
discover
the
case
containing
the
treaty
and
go
off
with
it
before
came
back
it
was
not
his
and
he
was
a
thief
therefore
i
should
be
doing
him
no
wrong
and
maxine
de
renzie
much
good
by
taking
it
if
he
had
left
it
behind
not
too
well
hidden
when
he
went
out
guided
in
the
darkness
by
a
slight
breeze
which
still
came
through
the
window
though
the
door
was
now
shut
i
shuffled
across
the
uncarpeted
floor
groping
with
hands
held
out
before
me
as
i
moved
in
a
moment
i
brushed
against
a
table
then
struck
my
shin
on
something
which
proved
to
be
the
leg
of
a
chair
lying
on
the
floor
i
pushed
it
out
of
the
way
but
had
gone
on
no
more
than
three
or
four
steps
when
i
caught
my
foot
in
a
rug
which
had
got
twisted
in
a
heap
round
the
fallen
chair
i
disentangled
myself
from
its
coils
only
to
slip
and
almost
lose
my
balance
by
stepping
into
some
spilled
liquid
which
lay
thick
and
greasy
on
the
bare
boards
the
warm
hopefulness
which
i
had
brought
into
this
dark
silent
room
was
chilled
and
dying
now
i
afraid
there
been
a
struggle
here
i
thought
and
if
there
had
been
a
struggle
what
of
the
treaty
there
seemed
to
be
a
good
deal
of
the
spilled
liquid
for
as
i
felt
my
way
along
more
anxious
than
ever
for
light
the
floor
was
still
wet
and
slippery
and
then
in
the
midst
of
the
puddle
i
stumbled
over
a
thing
that
was
heavy
and
soft
to
the
touch
of
my
foot
a
queer
tingling
like
the
sting
of
a
thousand
tiny
electric
needles
prickled
through
my
veins
for
even
before
i
stooped
and
laid
my
hand
on
that
barrier
which
was
so
heavy
and
yet
so
soft
as
it
stopped
my
path
i
knew
what
it
would
prove
to
be
it
was
as
if
i
could
see
through
the
dark
to
what
it
hid
but
though
there
was
no
surprise
left
there
was
a
shock
of
horror
as
my
fingers
touched
an
arm
a
throat
an
upturned
face
and
my
fingers
were
wet
as
i
knew
my
boots
must
be
and
i
knew
too
with
what
they
were
wet
i
ashamed
to
say
that
after
the
first
shock
of
the
discovery
my
impulse
was
to
get
away
and
out
of
the
whole
business
in
which
for
reasons
which
concerned
others
even
more
than
myself
it
would
be
unpleasant
to
be
involved
just
at
this
time
especially
i
could
go
downstairs
now
past
the
sleeping
concierge
and
with
luck
no
one
need
ever
know
that
i
had
been
in
this
dark
room
of
death
but
as
quickly
as
the
impulse
came
it
went
i
must
stop
here
and
search
for
the
treaty
no
matter
what
happened
until
i
had
found
it
or
made
sure
it
was
not
to
be
found
i
must
not
think
of
escape
if
there
were
matches
in
the
room
well
and
good
if
not
i
must
go
elsewhere
for
them
and
come
back
it
was
a
grim
task
but
it
had
to
be
done
somehow
i
got
to
the
mantelpiece
and
there
luckily
among
a
litter
of
pipes
and
bottles
and
miscellaneous
rubbish
i
did
lay
my
hand
on
a
broken
cup
containing
a
few
matches
i
struck
one
which
showed
me
on
the
mantel
an
end
of
a
candle
standing
up
in
a
bed
of
its
own
grease
i
lighted
it
and
not
until
the
flame
was
burning
brightly
did
i
look
round
there
was
but
a
faint
illumination
yet
it
was
enough
to
give
me
the
secret
of
the
room
i
might
have
seen
all
at
a
glance
as
i
came
in
before
the
light
of
my
last
match
was
blown
out
by
the
wind
had
not
the
door
as
i
opened
it
formed
a
screen
between
me
and
the
dead
man
on
the
floor
he
lay
in
the
midst
of
the
wildest
confusion
in
falling
he
had
dragged
with
him
the
cover
of
a
table
and
a
glass
lamp
which
was
smashed
in
pieces
the
spilled
oil
mingling
with
the
stream
of
his
blood
a
chair
had
been
overturned
and
a
broken
plate
and
tumbler
with
the
tray
that
had
held
them
were
half
hidden
in
the
folds
of
a
disordered
rug
but
this
was
not
all
the
struggle
for
life
did
not
account
for
the
condition
of
other
parts
of
the
room
papers
were
scattered
over
the
floor
the
drawers
of
an
old
escritoire
had
been
jerked
out
of
place
and
their
contents
strewn
far
and
near
the
doors
of
a
wardrobe
were
open
and
a
few
shabby
coats
and
pairs
of
trousers
thrown
about
with
the
pockets
wrong
side
out
or
torn
in
rags
a
chest
of
drawers
had
been
ransacked
and
a
narrow
hospital
bed
stripped
of
sheets
and
blankets
the
stuffing
of
the
mattress
pulled
into
small
pieces
the
room
looked
as
if
a
whirlwind
had
swept
through
it
and
as
i
forced
myself
to
go
near
the
body
i
saw
that
it
had
not
been
left
in
peace
by
the
murderer
the
coat
was
open
the
pockets
of
the
garments
turned
out
like
those
in
the
wardrobe
and
all
the
clothing
disarranged
evidently
by
hands
which
searched
for
something
with
frenzied
haste
and
merciless
determination
the
cunning
forethought
of
the
wretched
man
had
availed
him
nothing
i
could
imagine
how
joyously
he
had
arrived
at
this
house
believing
that
he
had
outwitted
the
enemy
i
pictured
his
disappointment
on
not
finding
the
friend
who
could
have
helped
and
supported
him
i
saw
how
he
had
planned
to
defend
himself
in
case
of
siege
by
locking
and
bolting
the
door
both
lock
and
bolt
were
broken
i
fancied
him
driven
by
hunger
to
search
his
friend
quarters
for
food
and
fearfully
beginning
a
supper
in
the
midst
of
which
he
had
probably
been
interrupted
almost
i
could
feel
the
horror
with
which
he
must
have
trembled
when
steps
came
along
the
corridor
when
the
door
was
tried
and
finally
broken
in
by
force
without
any
cry
of
his
being
heard
i
guessed
how
he
had
rushed
to
the
window
opened
it
only
to
stare
down
at
the
depths
below
and
return
desperately
to
stand
at
bay
to
protest
to
the
avengers
that
he
had
not
the
jewels
that
he
had
been
deceived
that
he
was
innocent
of
any
intention
to
defraud
them
that
he
would
explain
all
make
anything
right
if
only
they
would
give
him
time
but
they
had
not
given
him
time
they
had
punished
him
for
robbing
them
of
the
diamonds
by
robbing
him
of
his
life
they
had
made
him
pay
with
the
extreme
penalty
for
his
treachery
and
yet
in
the
flickering
the
stricken
face
though
it
was
seemed
to
leer
slyly
as
if
in
the
knowledge
that
they
had
been
cheated
in
the
end
the
confusion
of
the
room
promised
badly
for
my
hopes
nevertheless
there
was
a
chance
that
the
murderers
intent
only
on
finding
the
diamonds
or
some
letters
relating
to
their
disposal
might
if
they
found
the
treaty
have
hastily
flung
it
aside
as
a
thing
of
no
value
though
the
corridors
of
the
house
were
lit
by
gas
this
room
had
none
and
the
lamp
being
broken
i
had
to
depend
upon
the
bit
of
candle
which
might
fail
while
i
still
had
need
of
it
i
separated
it
carefully
from
its
bed
of
grease
on
the
mantel
and
as
i
did
so
the
wavering
light
touched
my
hand
and
shirt
cuff
both
were
stained
red
and
i
turned
slightly
sick
at
the
sight
there
was
blood
on
my
brown
boots
too
and
the
grey
tweed
clothes
which
i
had
not
had
time
to
change
since
arriving
in
paris
i
told
myself
that
i
must
do
my
best
to
wash
away
these
stains
before
leaving
the
room
but
first
i
would
look
for
the
treaty
i
began
my
search
by
stirring
up
the
mass
of
scattered
papers
on
the
floor
and
in
spite
of
the
horror
which
gripped
me
by
the
throat
i
cried
hurrah
when
half
hidden
by
the
twisted
rug
i
saw
the
missing
it
was
lying
spread
open
back
uppermost
and
there
came
an
instant
of
despair
when
i
pounced
on
it
only
to
find
it
empty
but
there
was
the
treaty
on
the
floor
underneath
and
lucky
it
was
that
the
searchers
had
thrown
it
out
for
there
were
gouts
of
blood
on
the
while
the
treaty
was
clean
and
unspotted
with
a
sense
of
unutterable
relief
which
almost
made
up
for
everything
endured
and
still
to
be
endured
i
slipped
the
document
back
into
the
pocket
from
which
it
had
been
stolen
at
that
moment
a
board
creaked
in
the
corridor
and
then
came
a
step
outside
the
door
my
blood
rushed
up
to
my
head
but
it
was
not
of
myself
i
thought
it
was
of
the
treaty
if
i
were
to
be
caught
here
alone
with
the
dead
man
my
hands
and
clothing
stained
with
his
blood
i
should
be
arrested
the
treaty
must
not
be
found
on
me
yet
i
must
hide
it
save
it
i
made
a
dash
for
the
window
and
once
outside
standing
on
the
narrow
balcony
i
threw
the
into
the
room
aiming
for
the
faint
starlight
sifting
through
heavy
clouds
showed
me
a
row
of
small
standing
in
a
wooden
box
hastily
i
wrapped
the
treaty
in
a
towel
which
hung
over
the
iron
railing
lifted
out
two
of
the
in
which
the
plants
were
dead
and
dry
laid
the
flat
parcel
i
had
made
in
the
bottom
of
the
box
and
replaced
the
pots
to
cover
and
conceal
it
then
i
walked
back
into
the
room
again
a
hand
fumbling
at
the
handle
of
the
door
pushed
it
open
with
a
faint
creaking
of
the
hinges
then
the
light
of
a
dark
lantern
flashed

some
people
apparently
understand
how
to
be
unhappy
gracefully
as
if
it
were
a
kind
of
fine
art
i
do
it
seems
too
bad
to
be
true
that
i
should
be
unhappy
and
as
if
i
must
wake
up
to
find
that
it
was
only
a
bad
dream
i
suppose
i
been
spoiled
a
good
deal
all
my
life
everybody
has
been
kind
to
me
and
tried
to
do
things
for
my
pleasure
just
as
i
have
for
them
and
i
have
taken
things
for
granted
except
of
course
with
lisa
but
lisa
is
different
different
from
everyone
else
in
the
world
i
have
never
expected
anything
from
her
as
i
have
from
others
all
i
wanted
was
to
make
her
as
happy
as
such
a
poor
little
piteous
creature
could
be
and
to
teach
myself
never
to
mind
anything
that
she
might
say
or
do
but
ivor
to
be
disappointed
in
him
to
be
made
miserable
by
him
i
did
know
it
was
possible
to
suffer
as
i
suffered
that
day
he
went
off
and
left
me
standing
in
the
i
did
dream
then
of
going
to
paris
if
anybody
had
told
me
i
would
go
i
should
have
said
no
no
i
will
not
and
yet
i
did
i
allowed
myself
to
be
persuaded
i
tried
to
make
myself
think
that
it
was
to
please
aunt
lilian
but
down
underneath
i
knew
all
the
time
it
was
that
really
it
was
because
i
could
bear
to
do
the
things
i
accustomed
to
doing
every
day
i
felt
as
if
i
should
cry
or
scream
or
do
something
ridiculous
and
awful
unless
there
were
a
change
of
some
sort
any
change
but
if
possible
some
novelty
and
excitement
with
people
talking
to
me
every
minute
perhaps
too
there
was
an
attraction
for
me
in
the
thought
that
i
would
be
in
paris
while
ivor
was
there
i
kept
reminding
myself
on
the
boat
and
the
train
that
nothing
good
could
happen
that
ivor
and
i
could
never
be
as
we
had
been
before
that
it
was
all
over
between
us
for
ever
and
ever
and
through
his
fault
but
there
at
the
bottom
was
the
thought
that
i
have
done
him
an
injustice
because
he
had
begged
me
to
trust
him
and
i
would
just
suppose
something
in
myself
kept
on
saying
that
we
should
by
mere
chance
meet
in
paris
and
he
should
be
able
to
prove
that
he
had
come
for
maxine
de
renzie
sake
it
would
be
too
glorious
i
should
begin
to
live
again
for
already
i
found
out
that
life
without
loving
and
trusting
ivor
was
life
at
all
he
could
think
i
had
followed
him
even
if
he
did
see
me
in
paris
because
i
would
be
with
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
lord
robert
west
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
be
very
nice
to
lord
bob
much
nicer
than
i
ever
had
been
if
ivor
happened
to
run
across
us
anywhere
then
that
very
thing
did
happen
in
the
strangest
and
most
unexpected
way
but
instead
of
being
happier
for
seeing
him
i
was
ten
times
more
unhappy
than
before
for
now
the
misery
had
no
gleam
of
hope
shining
through
its
blackness
that
was
what
i
told
myself
at
first
but
after
we
had
met
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
and
ivor
had
seemed
confused
and
would
give
up
his
mysterious
engagement
or
say
what
it
was
though
lisa
chaffed
him
and
he
have
known
what
i
thought
i
suddenly
forgot
the
slight
he
had
put
upon
me
instead
of
being
angry
with
him
i
was
for
him
i
could
have
explained
why
unless
it
was
the
look
on
his
face
when
he
turned
away
from
me
no
man
would
look
like
that
who
was
going
of
his
own
free
will
to
a
woman
with
whom
he
was
in
love
that
same
queer
something
whispered
in
my
ear
instead
of
feeling
sick
and
sorry
for
myself
and
desperately
angry
with
him
it
was
ivor
i
felt
sorry
for
i
pretended
not
to
care
whether
he
stayed
or
went
and
talked
to
lord
robert
west
as
if
i
forgotten
that
there
was
such
a
person
as
ivor
dundas
i
even
turned
my
back
on
him
before
he
was
gone
still
i
seemed
to
see
the
tragic
look
in
his
eyes
and
the
dogged
set
of
his
jaw
it
was
just
as
if
he
were
going
away
from
me
to
his
death
and
his
face
was
like
that
of
the
man
in
millais
picture
of
the
huguenot
lovers
i
wondered
if
that
girl
had
been
because
he
would
let
her
tie
round
his
arm
the
white
scarf
that
might
have
saved
him
it
is
strange
how
one
mood
can
change
in
a
moment
but
perhaps
it
is
like
that
only
with
women
a
minute
before
i
been
trying
to
despise
ivor
and
to
argue
just
as
if
i
been
a
mamma
to
myself
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
if
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
marry
lord
bob
that
it
would
be
rather
nice
being
a
duchess
some
day
and
that
besides
perhaps
ivor
would
be
sorry
when
he
heard
that
i
was
engaged
to
somebody
else
but
then
as
i
said
quite
suddenly
it
was
as
if
a
sharp
knife
had
been
stuck
into
my
heart
and
turned
round
and
round
i
would
have
given
anything
to
run
after
ivor
to
tell
him
that
i
loved
him
dreadfully
and
would
trust
him
in
spite
of
all
you
look
as
pale
as
if
you
were
going
to
faint
said
lisa
in
her
little
voice
which
though
she
does
speak
loudly
always
reaches
to
the
farthest
corners
of
the
biggest
rooms
i
did
think
it
was
unkind
of
her
to
call
everyone
attention
to
me
just
then
for
even
strangers
heard
and
turned
to
throw
a
glance
at
me
as
they
passed
it
must
be
the
light
i
said
for
i
do
feel
in
the
least
faint
that
was
a
fib
because
when
you
are
as
miserable
as
i
was
at
that
minute
your
heart
feels
cold
and
heavy
as
though
it
could
hardly
go
on
beating
but
i
felt
that
if
ever
a
fib
were
excusable
that
one
was
i
a
little
tired
though
i
went
on
none
of
us
got
to
bed
till
after
three
last
night
and
this
day
though
very
nice
of
course
has
been
rather
long
i
think
if
you
do
mind
aunt
lil
i
go
straight
to
my
room
when
we
get
upstairs
we
all
went
up
together
in
the
lift
but
i
said
to
the
others
at
the
door
of
the
pretty
at
the
end
of
uncle
eric
suite
sha
i
come
with
you
asked
lisa
but
i
said
no
it
was
something
new
for
her
to
offer
to
help
me
for
she
is
very
strong
and
has
always
been
the
one
to
be
petted
and
watched
over
by
me
though
she
a
few
years
older
than
i
am
aunt
lilian
had
brought
her
maid
without
whom
she
ca
get
on
even
for
a
single
night
but
lisa
and
i
had
left
ours
at
home
and
aunt
lil
had
offered
to
let
morton
help
us
as
much
as
we
liked
i
had
been
shut
up
in
my
room
for
two
minutes
therefore
when
morton
knocked
to
ask
if
she
could
do
anything
but
i
thanked
her
and
sent
her
away
i
had
not
yet
begun
to
undress
but
was
standing
in
the
window
looking
along
the
champs
élysées
brilliant
still
with
electric
lights
and
full
of
carriages
and
bringing
people
home
from
theatres
and
or
taking
them
to
restaurants
for
supper
down
there
somewhere
was
ivor
going
farther
away
from
me
every
moment
though
last
night
at
about
this
time
he
had
been
telling
me
how
he
loved
me
how
i
was
the
one
girl
in
the
world
for
him
and
always
always
would
be
here
was
i
remembering
in
spite
of
myself
every
word
he
had
said
hearing
again
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
seeing
the
look
in
his
eyes
as
he
said
it
there
was
he
going
to
the
woman
for
whose
sake
he
had
been
willing
to
break
with
me
but
was
he
going
to
her
i
asked
myself
if
not
when
they
had
chaffed
him
he
might
easily
have
mentioned
what
his
engagement
really
was
knowing
as
he
must
have
known
exactly
how
he
made
me
suffer
still
why
had
he
looked
so
miserable
if
he
did
care
what
i
thought
and
was
really
ready
to
throw
me
over
at
a
call
from
her
the
whole
thing
began
to
appear
more
complicated
more
mysterious
than
i
had
felt
it
to
be
at
first
when
i
was
smarting
with
my
disappointment
in
ivor
and
tingling
all
over
with
the
humiliation
he
seemed
to
have
put
upon
me
oh
to
know
to
what
he
doing
at
this
minute
i
whispered
half
aloud
because
it
was
comforting
in
my
loneliness
to
hear
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
to
whether
i
doing
him
the
most
awful
injustice
or
not
just
then
at
the
door
between
my
room
and
lisa
next
to
mine
came
a
tapping
and
instantly
after
the
handle
was
tried
but
i
had
turned
the
key
thinking
that
perhaps
this
very
thing
might
happen
that
lisa
might
wish
to
come
and
not
wait
till
i
given
her
permission
she
does
that
sort
of
thing
sometimes
for
she
is
rather
curious
and
impish
ivor
calls
her
imp
and
if
she
thinks
people
do
want
her
that
is
the
very
time
when
she
most
wants
them
oh
di
do
let
me
in
she
exclaimed
for
a
second
or
two
i
did
answer
never
in
my
life
had
i
liked
poor
lisa
less
than
i
liked
her
for
the
last
four
and
twenty
hours
though
i
told
myself
over
and
over
again
that
she
meant
well
that
she
was
acting
for
my
good
and
that
some
day
i
would
be
grateful
instead
of
longing
to
slap
her
as
i
could
help
doing
now
but
always
before
when
she
has
irritated
me
until
i
nearly
forgotten
my
promise
to
her
father
my
always
to
be
gentle
with
her
in
thought
and
deed
i
have
felt
such
pangs
of
remorse
that
i
tried
to
atone
even
when
there
was
really
anything
to
atone
for
except
in
my
mind
i
was
afraid
that
if
i
refused
to
let
her
come
in
she
would
go
to
bed
angry
with
me
and
when
lisa
is
angry
she
generally
has
a
heart
attack
and
is
ill
next
day
di
are
you
there
she
called
again
without
answering
i
went
to
the
door
and
unlocked
it
she
came
in
with
a
rush
i
feel
perfectly
wild
as
if
i
must
do
something
desperate
she
said
so
did
i
but
i
did
mean
to
let
her
know
that
i
going
out
she
went
on
if
i
do
i
shall
have
a
fit
out
i
repeated
you
ca
it
midnight
ca
there
no
such
word
for
me
as
when
i
want
to
do
anything
and
you
ought
to
know
that
said
she
it
only
being
ill
that
ever
stops
me
and
i
not
ill
i
feel
as
if
electricity
were
flowing
all
through
me
making
my
nerves
jump
and
i
believe
you
feel
exactly
the
same
way
your
eyes
are
as
big
as
and
as
black
as
ink
i
a
little
nervous
i
confessed
and
i
could
help
thinking
it
odd
that
lisa
and
i
should
both
be
feeling
that
electrical
sensation
at
the
same
time
perhaps
it
in
the
air
maybe
there
going
to
be
a
there
are
clouds
over
the
stars
and
a
wind
coming
up
maybe
it
partly
that
maybe
not
said
she
but
there
one
thing
i
sure
of
going
to
do
you
feel
that
too
i
broke
out
before
i
stopped
to
think
then
i
wished
i
had
but
it
was
too
late
to
wish
lisa
caught
me
up
quickly
ah
i
you
did
she
cried
looking
as
eerie
and
almost
as
haggard
as
a
witch
something
going
to
happen
come
go
with
me
and
be
in
it
whatever
it
is
no
i
said
and
you
must
go
either
but
she
was
weird
she
seemed
to
lure
me
like
a
strange
little
siren
with
all
a
siren
witchery
though
without
her
beauty
my
voice
sounded
undecided
and
i
knew
it
of
course
i
not
asking
you
to
wander
with
me
in
the
night
hand
in
hand
through
the
streets
of
paris
like
the
two
orphans
said
lisa
i
going
to
have
a
closed
carriage
a
one
belonging
to
the
hotel
so
it
quite
safe
it
ordered
already
and
i
shall
first
drive
and
drive
until
my
nerves
stop
jerking
and
my
head
throbbing
if
you
wo
drive
with
me
i
shall
drive
alone
but
there
be
no
harm
in
it
either
way
i
did
know
you
were
so
conventional
as
to
think
there
could
be
where
your
brave
independent
american
spirit
i
not
conventional
i
said
yes
you
are
living
in
england
has
spoiled
you
you
afraid
of
things
you
never
used
to
be
afraid
of
i
not
afraid
of
things
and
i
not
a
bit
changed
i
said
you
only
want
to
me
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
it
would
be
so
much
nicer
than
going
alone
she
begged
supposing
i
got
ill
in
a
hired
cab
i
might
you
know
but
i
stay
indoors
whatever
happens
if
we
were
together
it
would
be
an
adventure
worth
remembering
very
well
i
said
i
go
with
you
not
for
the
adventure
but
rather
than
have
you
make
a
fuss
because
i
try
to
keep
you
in
and
rather
than
you
should
go
alone
good
girl
exclaimed
lisa
quite
pleasant
and
purring
now
that
she
had
got
her
way
though
if
i
refused
she
would
probably
have
cried
she
is
terrifying
when
she
cries
great
deep
sobs
seem
almost
to
tear
her
frail
little
body
to
pieces
she
goes
deadly
white
and
sometimes
ends
up
by
a
fit
of
trembling
as
if
she
were
in
an
ague
have
you
really
ordered
a
motor
cab
i
asked
yes
said
she
i
rang
for
a
waiter
and
sent
him
down
to
tell
the
big
porter
at
the
front
door
to
get
me
one
then
i
gave
him
five
francs
and
said
i
did
not
want
anybody
to
know
because
i
must
visit
a
poor
sick
friend
who
had
written
to
say
she
was
in
great
trouble
but
wished
to
tell
no
one
except
me
that
she
come
to
paris
i
should
have
thought
such
an
elaborate
story
necessary
to
a
waiter
i
remarked
tossing
up
my
chin
a
little
for
i
do
like
lisa
subterranean
ways
but
this
time
she
did
even
try
to
defend
herself
let
get
ready
at
once
she
said
i
going
to
put
on
my
long
travelling
cloak
to
cover
up
this
dress
and
wear
my
black
toque
with
a
veil
i
suppose
you
do
the
same
then
we
can
slip
out
and
down
the
stairs
the
carriage
is
to
wait
for
us
at
the
side
entrance
i
looked
at
her
trying
to
read
her
secretive
little
face
lisa
are
you
planning
to
go
somewhere
in
particular
do
something
you
want
to
on
me
when
it
too
late
for
me
to
get
out
of
it
how
horrid
of
you
to
be
so
suspicious
of
me
you
hurt
my
feelings
i
have
had
an
inspiration
yet
so
i
ca
make
a
plan
but
it
will
come
i
know
it
will
i
shall
where
we
ought
to
go
to
be
in
the
midst
of
an
adventure
oh
without
being
mixed
up
in
it
so
do
look
horrified
i
told
you
that
something
was
going
to
happen
and
that
i
wanted
to
be
in
it
well
i
mean
to
be
when
the
inspiration
comes
we
put
on
our
dark
hats
and
long
travelling
cloaks
i
pinned
on
veil
and
my
own
then
she
peeped
to
see
if
anyone
were
about
but
there
was
nobody
in
the
corridor
we
hurried
out
and
as
lisa
already
knew
where
to
find
the
stairs
we
were
soon
on
the
way
down
at
the
side
entrance
of
the
hotel
the
was
waiting
and
when
we
were
both
seated
inside
lisa
spoke
in
french
to
the
driver
who
waited
for
orders
i
think
you
might
take
us
to
the
rue
drive
fast
please
after
that
i
tell
you
where
to
go
next
is
this
your
i
asked
i
not
sure
yet
why
and
her
voice
was
rather
sharp
for
no
particular
reason
i
a
little
curious
that
all
we
drove
on
for
some
minutes
in
silence
i
was
sure
now
that
lisa
had
been
playing
with
me
that
all
along
she
had
had
some
special
destination
in
her
mind
and
that
she
had
her
own
reasons
for
wanting
to
bring
me
to
it
but
what
use
to
ask
more
questions
she
did
not
mean
me
to
find
out
until
she
was
ready
for
me
to
know
she
had
told
the
man
to
go
quickly
and
he
obeyed
he
rushed
us
round
corners
and
through
street
after
street
which
i
had
never
seen
before
quiet
streets
where
there
were
no
cabs
and
no
gay
people
coming
home
from
theatres
and
dinners
at
last
we
turned
into
a
particularly
dull
little
street
and
stopped
is
this
the
rue
lisa
enquired
of
the
driver
jumping
quickly
up
and
putting
her
head
out
of
the
window
oui
i
heard
the
man
answer
then
stop
where
you
are
please
until
i
give
you
new
orders
i
should
have
thought
this
was
the
sort
of
street
where
nothing
could
possibly
happen
said
i
wait
a
little
and
maybe
you
find
out
you
mistaken
if
nothing
does
and
we
are
amused
we
can
go
on
somewhere
else
she
had
not
finished
speaking
when
a
handsome
electric
carriage
spun
almost
noiselessly
round
the
corner
it
slowed
down
before
a
gate
set
in
a
high
wall
almost
covered
with
creepers
and
though
the
street
was
dimly
lighted
and
we
had
stopped
at
a
little
distance
i
could
see
that
the
house
behind
the
wall
though
not
large
was
very
quaint
and
pretty
an
unusual
sort
of
house
for
paris
it
seemed
to
me
scarcely
had
the
electric
carriage
come
to
a
halt
when
the
chauffeur
in
neat
dark
livery
jumped
down
to
open
the
door
and
quickly
a
tall
slim
woman
sprang
out
followed
by
another
elderly
and
stout
who
looked
like
a
lady
maid
i
could
not
see
the
face
of
either
but
the
light
of
the
lamp
on
our
side
of
the
way
shone
on
the
hair
of
the
slim
young
woman
in
black
who
got
down
first
it
was
gorgeous
hair
the
colour
of
burnished
copper
i
had
heard
a
man
say
once
that
only
two
women
in
the
world
had
hair
of
that
exact
shade
jane
hading
and
maxine
de
renzie
my
heart
gave
a
great
bound
and
i
guessed
in
an
instant
why
lisa
had
brought
me
here
though
how
she
could
have
learned
where
to
find
the
house
i
did
know
oh
lisa
i
reproached
her
how
you
it
really
an
inspiration
i
sure
of
that
now
she
said
quietly
though
i
could
tell
by
her
tone
that
she
was
trying
to
hide
excitement
you
never
saw
that
woman
before
except
once
on
the
stage
yet
you
know
who
she
is
you
jumped
as
if
she
had
fired
a
shot
at
you
i
know
by
the
hair
i
answered
i
might
have
foreseen
this
would
be
the
kind
of
thing
you
would
think
of
it
like
you
you
ought
to
be
grateful
to
me
for
thinking
of
it
said
lisa
entirely
for
your
sake
and
it
quite
true
it
was
an
inspiration
to
come
here
this
afternoon
in
the
train
i
read
an
interview
in
with
maxine
de
renzie
about
the
new
play
she
produced
there
was
a
picture
of
her
and
a
description
of
her
house
in
the
rue
now
you
have
satisfied
your
curiosity
you
seen
her
back
and
her
maid
back
and
the
garden
wall
i
said
more
sharply
than
i
often
speak
to
lisa
i
shall
tell
the
driver
to
take
us
to
the
hotel
at
once
i
know
why
you
want
to
wait
here
but
you
sha
i
wo
i
going
away
as
quickly
as
i
can
she
caught
my
dress
as
i
would
have
leaned
out
to
speak
to
the
driver
her
manner
had
suddenly
changed
and
she
was
all
softness
and
sweetness
and
persuasiveness
di
dearest
girl
be
cross
with
me
please
misunderstand
she
implored
i
love
you
you
know
even
if
you
sometimes
think
i
do
i
want
you
to
be
happy
oh
wait
a
moment
and
listen
i
been
so
miserable
all
day
knowing
you
were
miserable
and
i
felt
horribly
guilty
for
fear
after
all
i
said
too
much
of
course
if
you
guessed
where
i
meant
to
come
you
would
have
stirred
out
of
the
hotel
and
it
was
better
for
you
to
see
for
yourself
unless
ivor
dundas
came
here
with
a
as
we
did
he
could
hardly
have
arrived
yet
so
if
he
does
come
we
shall
know
if
he
come
we
shall
know
too
think
how
happy
you
feel
if
he
apologise
to
you
then
frankly
and
freely
and
i
suppose
you
would
not
mind
apologising
to
him
if
necessary
he
may
be
in
the
house
now
i
said
more
to
myself
than
to
lisa
if
he
is
he
come
out
and
meet
her
when
he
hears
the
gate
open
there
it
open
now
the
maid
unlocked
it
no
there
nobody
in
the
garden
i
ca
stop
here
and
watch
for
him
like
a
spy
i
said
not
like
a
spy
but
like
a
girl
who
thinks
she
may
have
done
a
man
an
injustice
it
for
sake
i
ask
you
to
stay
and
if
you
wo
i
must
stay
alone
if
you
insist
on
going
away
i
get
out
and
stand
in
the
street
either
until
ivor
dundas
has
come
or
until
i
sure
he
is
coming
but
how
much
better
to
wait
and
see
for
yourself
you
know
i
ca
go
off
and
leave
you
standing
here
i
answered
and
i
ca
leave
you
sitting
in
the
carriage
and
walk
through
the
streets
alone
i
might
meet
i
would
not
finish
my
sentence
but
lisa
must
nave
guessed
the
name
on
my
lips
the
only
thing
to
do
then
is
for
us
to
stop
where
we
are
together
said
lisa
for
stop
i
must
and
shall
in
justice
to
myself
to
ivor
dundas
and
to
you
you
could
force
me
away
even
if
you
wanted
to
use
force
which
you
know
is
out
of
the
question
i
said
desperately
but
why
has
your
conscience
begun
to
reproach
you
for
trying
to
put
me
against
ivor
you
seemed
to
have
no
scruples
whatever
last
night
and
this
morning
i
been
thinking
hard
since
then
i
want
my
warning
to
you
either
to
be
justified
or
else
i
want
to
apologise
humbly
for
if
ivor
come
to
this
house
in
spite
of
his
embarrassment
when
he
spoke
about
an
engagement
i
shall
believe
that
he
does
care
a
rap
about
maxine
de
renzie
i
said
no
more
but
leaned
back
against
the
cushions
my
heart
beating
as
if
it
were
in
my
throat
and
my
brain
throbbing
in
time
with
it
i
could
not
think
or
argue
with
myself
what
was
really
right
and
wise
to
do
i
could
only
give
myself
up
and
drift
with
circumstances
a
man
has
just
come
round
the
far
corner
whispered
lisa
is
it
ivor
i
ca
make
out
he
does
look
our
way
thank
heaven
we
too
far
off
for
him
to
see
our
faces
i
would
rather
die
than
have
ivor
know
we
here
i
broke
out
i
do
think
it
is
ivor
lisa
went
on
he
hidden
himself
in
the
shadow
as
if
he
were
watching
it
house
he
interested
in
who
can
he
be
if
not
ivor
a
detective
perhaps
why
should
a
detective
watch
mademoiselle
de
renzie
house
i
asked
in
spite
of
myself
lisa
seemed
a
little
confused
as
if
she
had
said
something
she
regretted
i
do
know
i
sure
she
answered
hastily
why
indeed
it
was
just
a
thought
the
man
seems
so
anxious
not
to
be
seen
oh
keep
back
di
do
look
out
for
an
instant
till
he
passed
ivor
is
coming
now
he
walking
in
a
great
hurry
there
he
ca
see
you
he
far
enough
away
for
you
to
peep
and
see
for
yourself
he
at
maxine
de
gate
it
was
all
over
then
and
no
more
hope
his
eyes
when
they
gave
me
that
tragic
look
had
lied
even
as
his
lips
had
lied
last
night
when
he
told
me
there
was
no
other
woman
in
his
world
but
me
i
wo
look
i
stammered
almost
choking
someone
i
ca
see
who
is
letting
him
in
the
gate
shut
behind
him
let
us
go
now
i
begged
no
no
not
yet
cried
lisa
i
must
know
what
happens
next
we
are
in
the
midst
of
it
indeed
i
hardly
cared
what
she
did
now
ivor
had
come
to
see
maxine
de
renzie
and
nothing
else
mattered
very
much
i
had
no
strength
to
insist
that
we
should
go
i
wonder
what
the
man
in
the
shadow
would
do
if
he
saw
us
lisa
said
then
she
leaned
out
on
the
side
away
from
the
hiding
man
and
softly
told
our
chauffeur
to
go
very
slowly
along
the
street
this
he
did
but
the
man
did
not
move
stop
before
that
house
behind
the
wall
with
the
creepers
directed
lisa
but
i
would
not
allow
that
no
he
shall
not
stop
there
i
exclaimed
lisa
i
forbid
it
had
your
way
in
everything
so
far
i
wo
let
you
have
it
in
this
very
well
we
turn
the
corner
into
the
next
street
to
please
you
said
lisa
and
she
gave
orders
to
the
chauffeur
again
now
stop
she
cried
when
we
had
gone
half
way
down
the
street
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
anyone
in
the
rue
then
in
another
instant
before
i
had
any
idea
what
she
meant
to
do
she
was
out
of
the
cab
running
like
a
child
in
the
direction
whence
we
had
come
i
looked
after
her
hesitating
whether
or
not
to
follow
for
i
could
not
bear
to
risk
meeting
ivor
and
saw
that
she
paused
at
the
corner
she
was
peeping
into
the
rue
to
find
out
what
was
happening
there
she
will
come
back
in
a
moment
or
two
i
said
to
myself
wearily
and
sat
waiting
for
a
little
while
she
stood
with
her
long
dress
gathered
up
under
her
cloak
then
she
darted
round
the
corner
and
vanished
if
she
had
not
appeared
again
almost
at
once
i
should
have
had
to
tell
the
driver
to
follow
though
i
hated
the
thought
of
going
again
into
the
street
where
maxine
de
renzie
lived
but
she
did
come
and
in
her
hand
was
a
pretty
little
brocade
bag
embroidered
with
gold
or
silver
that
sparkled
even
in
the
faint
light
i
saw
this
lying
in
the
street
and
ran
to
pick
it
up
she
exclaimed
you
might
better
have
left
it
i
said
stiffly
perhaps
mademoiselle
de
renzie
dropped
it
no
i
do
think
so
it
was
in
front
of
her
house
it
may
belong
to
that
man
who
was
watching
then
it
does
look
much
like
a
thing
that
a
man
would
carry
about
with
him
does
it
no
i
admitted
indifferently
now
we
will
go
home
do
you
want
to
wait
and
see
how
long
ivor
dundas
stops
indeed
i
do
i
cried
i
do
want
to
know
any
more
about
him
and
for
the
moment
i
almost
believed
that
what
i
said
was
true
very
well
said
lisa
perhaps
we
do
know
enough
to
prove
to
us
both
that
i
have
anything
to
reproach
myself
with
and
the
less
you
think
about
him
after
this
the
better
i
sha
think
about
him
at
all
i
said
but
i
knew
that
was
a
boast
i
should
never
be
able
to
keep
try
as
i
might
i
felt
now
that
i
could
understand
how
people
must
feel
when
they
are
very
old
and
weary
of
life
i
do
believe
that
i
shall
feel
older
and
more
tired
if
i
live
to
be
eighty
than
i
felt
then
it
was
a
slight
comfort
to
know
that
we
were
on
our
way
back
to
the
hotel
and
that
soon
i
should
be
in
my
room
alone
with
the
door
shut
and
locked
between
lisa
and
me
but
it
was
only
very
slight
i
could
imagine
ever
being
really
pleased
about
anything
again
you
will
marry
lord
robert
now
i
suppose
chirped
lisa
and
show
ivor
dundas
that
he
has
spoiled
your
life
as
she
asked
this
question
she
was
tugging
away
at
a
knot
in
the
ribbons
that
tied
the
bag
she
had
found
perhaps
i
shall
i
answered
i
might
do
worse
i
should
think
you
might
exclaimed
lisa
oh
do
accept
him
soon
i
do
want
ivor
dundas
to
say
to
himself
that
you
for
him
lord
bob
is
sure
to
propose
to
you
even
if
he
already
and
if
he
has
he
do
it
again
i
saw
it
in
his
eye
all
he
was
dying
to
speak
at
any
minute
if
only
he
got
a
chance
with
you
alone
you
say
when
he
does
wo
you
and
have
the
engagement
announced
at
once
i
see
how
i
feel
at
the
time
if
it
comes
i
answered
trying
to
speak
gaily
but
making
a
failure
of
it
at
last
lisa
had
got
the
brocade
bag
open
and
was
looking
in
she
seemed
surprised
by
what
she
saw
and
very
much
interested
she
put
in
her
hand
and
touched
the
thing
whatever
it
was
but
she
did
not
tell
me
what
was
there
probably
she
wanted
to
excite
my
curiosity
and
make
me
ask
but
i
did
care
enough
to
humour
her
if
the
bag
had
been
stuffed
full
of
the
most
gorgeous
jewels
in
the
world
at
that
moment
i
should
have
been
interested
in
the
least
i
saw
lisa
give
a
little
sidelong
peep
up
at
me
to
see
if
i
were
watching
but
when
she
found
me
looking
entirely
indifferent
she
tied
up
the
bag
again
and
stowed
it
away
in
one
of
the
deep
pockets
of
her
travelling
cloak
i
was
afraid
that
when
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
and
gone
up
to
our
rooms
lisa
might
want
to
stop
with
me
and
be
vexed
when
i
turned
her
out
as
i
felt
i
must
do
but
she
seemed
to
have
lost
interest
in
me
and
my
affairs
now
that
all
doubt
was
settled
she
did
even
wish
to
talk
over
what
had
happened
but
when
i
bade
her
simply
said
in
return
and
let
me
shut
the
door
between
the
rooms
i
suppose
i
thought
that
the
best
thing
i
shall
have
to
hope
for
after
this
until
i
grow
quite
old
is
to
sleep
and
be
happy
in
my
dreams
but
though
i
tried
hard
to
put
away
thoughts
of
all
kinds
and
fall
asleep
i
could
my
eyes
would
not
stay
closed
for
more
than
a
minute
at
a
time
and
always
i
found
myself
staring
at
the
window
hour
after
hour
hoping
for
the
light
chapter
xv
diana
hears
news
it
seemed
as
if
the
night
would
never
end
if
i
had
been
vain
and
deserved
to
be
punished
for
my
vanity
then
i
was
well
punished
now
i
felt
so
ashamed
and
humiliated
it
must
have
been
long
after
one
when
i
went
to
bed
yet
i
was
thankful
when
dawn
came
and
gave
me
an
excuse
to
get
up
after
i
had
had
a
cold
bath
however
i
felt
better
and
a
cup
of
steaming
hot
coffee
afterwards
did
me
good
i
was
all
dressed
when
morton
aunt
maid
knocked
at
my
door
to
ask
if
i
were
up
and
if
she
could
help
me
do
my
hair
her
ladyship
sent
me
her
love
and
hoped
i
had
rested
nicely
she
would
be
pleased
to
hear
that
i
was
looking
well
looking
well
i
was
glad
to
know
that
though
it
surprised
me
i
stared
at
myself
in
the
glass
and
wondered
that
so
many
hours
of
misery
had
made
so
little
impression
on
my
face
i
was
rather
paler
than
usual
perhaps
but
my
cheeks
were
faintly
pink
and
my
lips
red
i
suppose
while
one
is
young
one
can
suffer
a
good
deal
and
one
face
tell
no
secret
we
were
to
make
a
very
early
start
to
examine
the
wonderful
which
lord
robert
west
had
advised
aunt
lil
to
buy
afterwards
she
and
lisa
and
i
had
planned
to
do
a
little
shopping
because
it
would
seem
a
waste
of
time
to
be
in
paris
and
bring
nothing
away
from
the
shops
but
when
i
tapped
at
lisa
door
dreading
yet
wishing
to
have
our
first
greeting
over
it
appeared
that
she
had
a
bad
headache
and
did
not
want
to
go
with
us
to
see
the
rajah
automobile
while
i
was
with
her
aunt
lil
came
in
looking
very
bright
and
handsome
she
was
so
sorry
for
lisa
and
not
at
all
sorry
for
me
how
little
she
guessed
and
before
taking
me
away
with
her
promised
to
come
back
after
it
was
settled
about
the
car
to
see
whether
lisa
were
well
enough
by
that
time
for
the
shopping
expedition
the
automobile
really
was
a
magnificent
animal
as
aunt
lil
said
and
it
took
her
just
two
minutes
after
examining
it
from
bonnet
to
to
make
up
her
mind
that
she
could
not
be
happy
without
it
it
was
sixty
horsepower
and
of
a
make
but
that
was
a
detail
car
could
be
powerful
and
well
made
every
car
should
be
or
you
would
not
pay
for
it
but
she
had
never
seen
one
before
with
such
heavenly
little
arrangements
for
luggage
and
lunch
while
as
for
the
gold
toilet
things
in
a
pale
grey
suède
case
they
were
beyond
words
and
she
must
have
them
the
motor
also
of
course
since
it
went
with
them
so
that
was
decided
and
she
and
i
drove
back
to
the
hotel
while
the
two
men
went
to
the
automobile
club
of
which
lord
bob
was
an
honorary
member
if
possible
all
formalities
were
to
be
got
through
with
the
agent
and
the
car
paid
for
at
two
when
we
were
to
meet
the
men
at
the
ritz
for
luncheon
they
were
to
let
us
know
whether
everything
had
been
successfully
arranged
and
if
so
aunt
lil
wanted
the
party
to
motor
to
calais
in
her
new
automobile
instead
of
going
by
train
lord
bob
would
drive
but
he
meant
to
hire
a
chauffeur
recommended
by
the
club
so
that
he
would
not
have
to
stop
behind
and
see
to
getting
the
car
across
the
channel
in
a
cargo
boat
aunt
lil
was
very
much
excited
over
this
idea
as
she
always
is
over
anything
new
and
if
i
was
rather
quiet
and
uninterested
she
was
too
much
occupied
to
notice
lisa
was
looking
worse
when
we
went
back
to
her
at
the
hotel
but
aunt
lil
did
notice
that
either
she
is
always
nice
to
lisa
but
she
does
like
her
and
it
is
only
when
you
really
care
for
people
that
you
observe
changes
in
them
when
you
are
busy
thinking
of
your
own
affairs
i
advised
lisa
to
rest
in
her
own
room
instead
of
shopping
as
she
would
have
the
long
motor
run
later
in
the
day
and
a
night
journey
but
she
was
dressed
and
seemed
to
want
to
go
out
she
had
things
to
do
she
said
and
though
she
did
buy
anything
when
she
was
with
us
while
we
were
at
a
milliner
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
choosing
hats
for
aunt
lil
she
disappeared
on
some
errand
of
her
own
and
only
came
back
just
as
we
were
ready
to
leave
the
shop
whatever
it
was
that
she
had
been
doing
it
had
interested
her
and
waked
her
out
of
herself
for
her
eyes
looked
brighter
and
she
had
spots
of
colour
on
her
cheeks
aunt
lil
found
so
much
to
do
and
was
sure
we
could
easily
carry
so
many
things
in
the
that
it
was
a
rush
to
meet
uncle
eric
and
lord
bob
at
the
ritz
by
two
but
we
did
manage
it
or
nearly
we
were
not
more
than
ten
minutes
late
which
was
wonderful
for
aunt
lil
and
the
short
time
that
we
kept
them
waiting
was
enough
to
account
for
the
solemnity
of
the
two
men
faces
as
they
came
forward
to
meet
us
something
gone
wrong
about
the
car
exclaimed
aunt
lil
no
the
car
all
right
said
lord
bob
i
got
you
a
chauffeur
too
and
then
what
has
happened
you
both
look
like
or
wet
blankets
or
something
disagreeable
it
surely
ca
be
because
hungry
that
you
cross
about
a
few
minutes
have
you
seen
a
newspaper
asked
uncle
eric
a
newspaper
i
should
think
not
indeed
we
had
too
many
important
things
to
do
to
waste
time
on
trifles
why
has
the
government
gone
out
ivor
dundas
has
got
into
a
mess
here
uncle
eric
answered
looking
very
much
worried
so
much
worried
that
i
thought
he
must
care
even
more
about
ivor
than
i
had
fancied
of
course
it
the
most
awful
rot
said
lord
bob
but
he
accused
of
murder
it
in
the
evening
papers
not
a
word
had
got
into
the
morning
ones
uncle
eric
went
on
we
only
just
seen
the
news
since
we
came
here
to
wait
for
you
otherwise
i
should
have
tried
to
do
something
for
him
as
it
is
of
course
i
must
as
a
friend
of
his
stop
in
paris
and
do
what
i
can
to
help
him
through
but
that
need
keep
the
rest
of
you
from
going
on
as
you
planned
what
an
awful
thing
exclaimed
aunt
lil
i
will
stay
too
if
the
girls
do
mind
poor
fellow
it
may
be
some
comfort
to
him
to
feel
that
he
has
friends
on
the
spot
standing
by
him
i
got
thousands
of
engagements
we
all
have
but
i
shall
telegraph
to
everybody
what
about
you
lord
bob
i
stand
by
with
you
lady
mountstuart
said
he
his
nice
though
not
very
clever
face
more
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
his
blue
eyes
watching
me
rather
wistfully
dundas
and
i
have
never
been
intimate
but
he
a
fine
chap
and
i
always
admired
him
he
sure
to
come
out
of
this
all
right
poor
lord
robert
i
had
much
thought
to
give
him
then
but
dimly
i
felt
that
his
anxiety
was
concerned
with
me
even
more
than
with
ivor
of
whom
he
spoke
so
kindly
though
he
had
often
shown
signs
of
jealousy
in
past
days
i
felt
stunned
and
almost
dazed
if
anyone
had
spoken
to
me
i
think
i
should
have
been
dumb
unable
to
answer
but
nobody
did
speak
or
seem
to
think
it
strange
that
i
had
nothing
to
say
i
suppose
you
wo
try
to
do
anything
until
after
lunch
will
you
mountstuart
lord
robert
went
on
to
ask
no
we
must
eat
and
talk
things
over
said
uncle
eric
we
went
into
the
restaurant
i
moving
as
if
i
were
in
a
dream
ivor
accused
of
murder
what
had
he
done
what
could
have
happened
but
i
was
soon
to
know
as
soon
as
we
were
seated
at
a
table
where
the
lovely
fresh
flowers
seemed
a
mockery
aunt
lil
began
asking
questions
for
some
reason
uncle
eric
apparently
did
not
like
answering
it
was
almost
as
if
he
had
had
some
kind
of
previous
knowledge
of
the
affair
of
which
he
did
wish
to
speak
but
i
suppose
it
could
not
have
been
that
it
was
lord
robert
who
told
us
nearly
everything
and
always
i
was
conscious
that
he
was
watching
me
wondering
if
this
were
a
cruel
blow
for
me
asking
himself
if
he
were
speaking
in
a
tactful
way
of
one
who
had
been
his
rival
there
was
that
engagement
of
dundas
last
night
which
he
was
just
going
to
keep
when
we
saw
him
said
lord
bob
carefully
but
clumsily
i
afraid
there
must
have
been
something
fishy
about
that
i
mean
some
trap
must
have
been
laid
to
catch
him
and
it
seems
he
supposed
to
be
in
paris
though
i
do
see
what
that
can
have
to
do
with
the
plot
if
there
is
one
he
was
stopping
in
the
hotel
under
another
name
no
doubt
he
had
some
good
reason
though
there
nothing
sly
about
dundas
if
ever
there
was
a
plucky
chap
he
one
anyhow
apparently
he
wanted
to
get
hold
of
a
man
in
paris
he
could
find
for
he
called
last
evening
on
a
detective
named
girard
a
rather
fellow
in
his
line
i
believe
it
almost
looks
as
if
dundas
had
made
an
enemy
of
him
for
he
been
giving
evidence
pretty
freely
to
the
police
lost
no
time
about
it
anyhow
girard
says
he
was
following
up
the
scent
tracking
down
the
person
he
been
hired
by
dundas
to
hunt
for
and
had
at
last
come
to
the
house
where
he
was
lodging
when
there
he
found
dundas
himself
ransacking
the
room
covered
with
blood
and
the
chap
who
was
wanted
lying
dead
on
the
floor
his
body
hardly
cold
what
time
was
all
that
enquired
lisa
sharply
it
was
the
first
question
she
had
asked
between
midnight
and
one
i
think
the
papers
said
answered
lord
bob
well
of
course
it
all
nonsense
exclaimed
aunt
lil
impatiently
french
people
are
so
sensational
and
they
jump
at
conclusions
so
the
idea
of
their
daring
to
accuse
a
man
like
ivor
dundas
of
murder
they
ought
to
know
better
they
soon
be
eating
and
begging
england
pardon
for
wrongful
treatment
of
a
british
subject
they
eric
i
afraid
there
no
question
of
jumping
at
conclusions
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
or
of
eating
uncle
eric
said
the
evidence
entirely
circumstantial
so
far
luckily
is
dead
against
ivor
and
as
for
his
being
a
british
subject
there
nothing
in
that
if
an
englishman
chooses
to
commit
a
murder
in
france
he
left
to
the
french
law
to
deal
with
as
if
he
were
a
frenchman
but
ivor
has
committed
murder
cried
aunt
lilian
horrified
of
course
not
but
he
got
to
prove
that
he
has
and
in
that
worse
off
than
if
this
thing
happened
in
england
english
law
supposes
a
man
innocent
until
he
been
proved
guilty
french
law
on
the
contrary
presumes
that
he
guilty
until
he
proved
innocent
in
face
of
the
evidence
against
ivor
the
authorities
could
have
done
otherwise
than
they
have
done
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
felt
angry
with
aunt
lilian
husband
i
do
hate
that
cold
stern
sense
of
justice
on
which
men
pride
themselves
so
much
whether
it
an
affair
of
a
friend
or
an
enemy
surely
dundas
must
have
been
able
to
prove
an
an
do
you
call
it
an
alibi
asked
lisa
he
did
try
to
replied
lord
bob
he
simply
refused
up
to
the
present
to
tell
what
he
was
doing
between
twelve
and
the
time
he
was
found
except
to
say
that
he
walked
for
a
good
while
before
going
to
the
house
where
girard
afterwards
found
him
of
course
he
denies
killing
the
man
says
the
fellow
had
stolen
something
from
him
on
the
boat
crossing
from
dover
to
calais
yesterday
and
that
after
applying
to
the
detective
he
got
a
note
from
the
thief
offering
to
give
the
thing
back
if
he
would
call
and
name
a
reward
says
he
found
the
room
already
ransacked
and
the
fellow
dead
when
he
arrived
at
the
address
given
him
that
he
was
searching
for
his
property
when
girard
appeared
on
the
scene
could
he
have
shown
the
note
sent
by
the
thief
asked
aunt
lil
he
did
show
a
note
but
it
does
him
more
harm
than
good
and
he
would
tell
what
the
thing
was
the
thief
had
taken
from
him
except
that
it
was
valuable
it
does
look
as
if
he
were
determined
to
make
the
case
as
black
as
possible
against
himself
but
then
as
i
said
before
no
doubt
he
has
good
reasons
he
has
no
good
luck
anyhow
sighed
aunt
lil
who
always
liked
ivor
rather
not
so
far
why
one
of
the
worst
bits
of
evidence
against
him
is
that
the
concierge
of
this
house
in
the
rue
de
la
fille
sauvage
swears
that
though
dundas
had
been
in
the
place
much
above
half
an
hour
when
the
detective
arrived
he
was
there
then
the
second
that
he
admitted
it
when
he
came
the
first
visit
he
made
according
to
the
concierge
was
about
an
hour
before
the
second
the
concierge
was
already
in
bed
in
his
little
box
but
not
asleep
when
a
man
rang
and
an
voice
asked
for
monsieur
gestre
on
hearing
that
gestre
was
away
the
visitor
said
he
would
see
the
gentleman
who
was
stopping
in
gestre
room
by
and
by
the
englishman
went
out
and
on
being
challenged
said
he
might
come
back
again
later
after
a
while
the
concierge
was
waked
up
once
more
by
a
caller
for
gestre
who
announced
that
he
been
before
and
now
he
vows
that
it
was
the
same
man
both
times
though
dundas
denies
having
called
twice
if
he
could
prove
that
he
been
in
the
house
no
more
than
half
an
hour
it
might
be
all
right
for
two
doctors
agree
that
the
murdered
man
had
been
dead
more
than
an
hour
when
they
were
called
in
but
he
ca
or
prove
it
that
his
luck
again
and
nobody
can
be
found
who
saw
him
in
any
of
the
streets
through
which
he
mentions
passing
the
last
moment
that
he
can
be
accounted
for
is
when
a
cabman
who
taken
him
up
at
the
hotel
just
after
he
left
us
set
him
down
in
the
rue
de
courbvoie
not
so
very
far
from
the
élysée
palace
then
it
was
only
between
five
and
ten
minutes
past
twelve
so
he
could
easily
have
gone
on
to
the
rue
de
la
fille
sauvage
afterwards
and
killed
his
man
at
the
time
when
the
doctors
say
the
fellow
must
have
died
it
a
bad
scrape
but
of
course
dundas
will
get
out
of
it
somehow
or
other
in
the
end
do
think
he
will
eric
asked
aunt
lil
i
hope
so
with
all
my
heart
he
answered
but
his
face
showed
that
he
was
deeply
troubled
and
my
heart
sank
down
down
as
i
realised
more
and
more
the
danger
in
which
ivor
stood
my
resentment
against
him
began
to
seem
curiously
trivial
nothing
had
happened
to
make
me
feel
that
i
had
done
him
an
injustice
in
thinking
he
cared
more
for
maxine
de
renzie
than
for
me
indeed
on
the
contrary
everything
went
to
prove
his
supreme
loyalty
to
her
whose
name
he
had
refused
to
speak
even
for
the
sake
of
clearing
himself
still
now
that
the
world
was
against
him
my
soul
rushed
to
stand
by
his
side
to
defend
him
to
give
him
love
and
trust
in
spite
of
all
down
deep
in
my
heart
i
forgave
him
even
though
he
had
been
cruel
and
i
yearned
over
him
with
an
exceeding
tenderness
more
than
anything
on
earth
i
wanted
to
help
him
and
i
meant
to
try
indeed
as
the
talk
went
on
while
that
terrible
meal
progressed
i
thought
i
saw
a
way
to
do
it
if
lisa
and
i
should
act
together
i
was
so
anxious
to
have
a
talk
with
her
that
i
could
hardly
wait
to
get
back
to
our
own
hotel
from
the
ritz
fortunately
nobody
wanted
to
sit
long
at
lunch
so
it
was
yet
three
when
i
called
her
into
my
room
the
men
had
gone
to
make
different
arrangements
about
starting
for
we
were
not
to
leave
paris
until
they
had
had
time
to
do
something
for
ivor
uncle
eric
went
to
see
the
british
ambassador
and
aunt
lilian
had
said
that
she
would
be
busy
for
at
least
an
hour
writing
letters
and
telegrams
to
cancel
engagements
we
had
had
in
london
for
awhile
lisa
and
i
were
almost
sure
not
to
be
interrupted
but
i
spoke
out
abruptly
what
was
in
my
mind
not
wishing
to
lose
a
minute
i
think
the
only
thing
for
us
to
do
i
said
is
to
tell
what
we
know
and
save
ivor
in
spite
of
himself
how
can
anything
you
know
save
him
she
asked
with
a
queer
faint
emphasis
which
i
did
understand
do
you
see
i
cried
that
if
we
come
forward
and
say
we
saw
him
in
the
rue
at
a
quarter
past
twelve
going
into
a
house
there
he
could
have
murdered
the
man
in
that
other
house
far
away
it
all
hangs
on
the
time
but
you
did
see
him
go
in
lisa
contradicted
me
i
stared
at
her
did
is
it
the
same
thing
no
not
unless
i
choose
to
say
so
and
but
you
will
choose
you
want
to
save
him
of
course
why
because
he
innocent
because
he
your
friend
no
man
is
the
friend
of
any
woman
if
he
in
love
with
another
oh
lisa
does
sophistry
of
that
sort
matter
does
anything
matter
except
saving
him
i
do
consider
she
said
in
a
slow
aggravating
way
that
ivor
dundas
has
behaved
very
well
to
to
our
family
but
i
want
you
to
understand
this
di
if
he
is
to
be
got
out
of
this
danger
no
doubt
it
real
danger
in
any
such
way
as
you
propose
it
for
to
do
it
not
you
he
have
to
owe
his
gratitude
to
me
and
something
else
i
can
do
for
him
perhaps
i
and
only
i
a
thing
of
value
was
stolen
from
him
it
seems
a
thing
he
was
anxious
to
get
back
at
any
price
even
the
price
of
looking
for
it
on
a
dead
man
body
well
i
think
i
know
what
that
thing
was
i
think
i
have
it
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
astonished
at
her
and
at
her
manner
and
her
words
i
not
going
to
tell
you
what
i
mean
only
i
sure
of
what
saying
at
least
that
the
thing
valuable
worth
risking
a
great
deal
for
i
learned
that
from
experts
this
morning
while
you
and
your
aunt
were
thinking
about
hats
for
an
instant
i
was
completely
bewildered
then
suddenly
a
strange
idea
sprang
into
my
mind
that
brocade
bag
you
picked
up
in
the
rue
last
night
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
thought
of
it
from
that
moment
to
this
there
had
been
so
many
other
things
which
seemed
more
important
lisa
looked
annoyed
i
think
she
had
counted
on
my
not
remembering
or
not
connecting
her
hints
with
the
thing
she
had
found
in
the
street
and
that
she
had
wanted
to
tantalise
me
i
wo
say
whether
i
mean
the
brocade
bag
or
not
and
whether
if
i
do
that
i
believe
ivor
dropped
it
or
whether
there
was
another
man
mixed
up
in
the
case
perhaps
the
real
murderer
if
i
decide
to
tell
what
i
know
and
what
i
suspect
it
wo
be
to
you
unless
for
a
very
particular
reason
and
it
wo
be
yet
awhile
i
afraid
that
i
almost
hated
her
for
a
moment
she
seemed
so
cold
so
calculating
and
sly
i
could
bear
to
think
that
she
was
my
and
i
was
glad
that
at
least
not
a
drop
of
the
same
blood
ran
in
our
veins
if
you
choose
to
keep
silent
for
some
purpose
of
your
own
i
broke
out
you
ca
prevent
me
from
telling
the
whole
story
as
know
it
how
i
went
out
with
you
and
all
that
i
ca
prevent
you
from
doing
it
but
i
can
advise
you
not
to
for
ivor
sake
she
answered
for
his
sake
yes
and
for
your
own
too
if
you
care
for
his
opinion
of
you
at
all
for
his
sake
because
of
us
knows
when
he
came
out
of
maxine
de
renzie
house
you
go
away
though
i
wanted
to
stay
and
watch
he
may
not
have
been
there
more
than
five
minutes
for
all
we
can
tell
to
the
contrary
in
which
case
he
would
still
have
had
time
to
go
straight
off
to
the
rue
de
la
fille
sauvage
and
kill
that
man
in
accordance
with
the
doctors
statements
about
the
death
for
sake
because
if
he
knows
that
you
tracked
him
to
maxine
de
house
he
wo
respect
you
very
much
and
because
he
would
probably
be
furious
with
you
unable
to
forgive
you
as
long
as
he
lived
for
injuring
the
reputation
of
the
woman
he
risked
so
much
to
save
believe
you
did
it
out
of
spiteful
jealousy
against
her
i
grew
cold
all
over
and
trembled
so
that
i
could
hardly
speak
ivor
would
know
that
i
incapable
of
such
baseness
i
not
sure
he
hold
you
above
it
hath
no
fury
like
a
woman
scorned
and
he
scorned
you
for
an
actress
it
was
as
if
she
had
struck
me
in
the
face
and
i
could
feel
the
blood
rush
up
to
my
cheeks
they
burned
so
hotly
that
the
tears
were
forced
to
my
eyes
you
see
i
right
do
you
lisa
asked
you
may
be
right
in
thinking
i
could
do
him
no
good
in
that
way
and
that
he
would
wish
it
even
if
i
could
but
not
about
the
rest
i
said
we
wo
talk
of
it
any
more
i
ca
stand
it
please
go
back
to
your
room
now
lisa
i
want
to
be
alone
very
well
she
snapped
called
me
in
i
did
ask
to
come
then
she
went
out
with
not
another
word
or
look
and
slammed
the
door
i
could
imagine
myself
compelling
her
to
give
up
the
brocade
bag
or
offering
her
some
great
bribe
of
money
thousands
of
pounds
if
necessary
lisa
is
a
strange
little
creature
she
will
do
a
good
deal
for
money
chapter
xvi
diana
undertakes
a
strange
errand
if
i
had
not
been
tingling
with
anger
against
lisa
who
had
seemed
to
enjoy
saying
needlessly
cruel
things
to
me
perhaps
i
would
have
been
utterly
discouraged
when
she
pricked
the
bubble
of
my
hope
she
had
made
me
realise
that
the
plan
i
had
was
useless
perhaps
worse
than
useless
but
in
my
desperate
mood
i
caught
at
another
i
would
try
to
see
ivor
and
find
out
some
other
way
of
helping
him
at
all
events
he
should
know
that
i
was
for
him
not
against
him
in
this
time
of
trouble
perhaps
this
new
idea
was
a
mad
one
i
told
myself
perhaps
i
should
not
be
allowed
to
see
him
even
in
the
presence
of
others
but
while
there
was
a
perhaps
i
would
give
up
without
waiting
for
a
cooler
or
more
cowardly
mood
to
set
in
i
almost
ran
out
of
my
room
and
downstairs
for
i
had
taken
off
my
hat
and
coat
since
coming
in
i
had
no
knowledge
of
french
law
or
police
etiquette
or
anything
of
that
sort
but
i
knew
the
french
as
a
gallant
nation
and
i
thought
that
if
a
girl
should
go
to
the
right
place
begging
for
a
short
conversation
with
an
accused
man
as
his
friend
an
interview
probably
with
a
witness
might
possibly
be
granted
the
authorities
might
think
that
we
were
engaged
for
all
i
cared
i
did
not
care
about
anything
now
except
seeing
ivor
and
helping
him
if
i
could
i
hardly
knew
what
i
meant
to
do
at
the
beginning
by
way
of
getting
the
chance
i
wanted
until
i
had
asked
to
have
a
called
for
me
then
i
suddenly
thought
of
the
british
ambassador
a
great
friend
of
uncle
eric
and
aunt
lilian
uncle
eric
had
already
been
to
him
but
i
fancied
not
with
a
view
of
trying
to
see
ivor
that
idea
had
apparently
not
been
in
his
mind
at
all
anyway
the
ambassador
would
already
understand
that
the
family
took
a
deep
interest
in
the
fate
of
ivor
dundas
and
would
not
be
wholly
astonished
at
receiving
a
call
from
me
besides
hearing
of
some
rather
venturesome
escapades
of
mine
when
i
first
arrived
in
london
he
had
once
while
visiting
uncle
eric
laughed
a
good
deal
and
said
that
in
future
he
would
be
surprised
at
nothing
an
american
girl
might
do
i
told
the
driver
to
go
to
the
british
embassy
as
fast
as
he
could
there
i
sent
in
my
name
and
the
ambassador
received
me
at
once
i
did
explain
much
but
came
to
the
point
immediately
and
said
that
i
wanted
oh
but
wanted
and
needed
very
much
indeed
to
see
ivor
dundas
could
he
would
he
help
me
to
do
that
ought
i
to
help
you
he
asked
would
mountstuart
and
lady
mountstuart
approve
yes
i
said
firmly
they
would
approve
you
see
it
is
necessary
then
if
it
necessary
and
i
believe
you
when
you
say
that
it
is
he
answered
i
do
what
i
can
what
he
could
do
and
did
do
was
to
write
a
personal
letter
to
the
chief
of
police
in
paris
asking
as
a
favour
that
his
friend
miss
forrest
a
young
lady
related
through
marriage
to
the
british
foreign
secretary
should
be
allowed
five
minutes
conversation
with
the
englishman
accused
of
murder
ivor
dundas
i
took
the
letter
to
the
chief
of
police
myself
to
save
time
and
because
i
was
so
restless
and
excited
that
i
must
be
doing
something
every
instant
something
which
i
felt
might
bring
me
nearer
to
ivor
from
the
chief
of
police
who
proved
to
be
a
most
courteous
person
i
received
an
order
to
give
to
the
governor
of
the
gaol
or
prison
where
they
had
put
ivor
this
he
explained
would
procure
me
the
interview
i
wanted
but
unfortunately
i
must
not
hope
to
see
my
friend
alone
a
warder
who
understood
english
would
have
to
be
present
so
far
i
had
gone
into
the
wild
venture
without
once
thinking
what
it
would
be
to
find
myself
suddenly
face
to
face
with
ivor
in
such
terrible
circumstances
or
what
he
would
think
of
me
for
coming
in
such
a
way
now
that
we
were
no
longer
anything
to
each
other
not
even
friends
but
a
kind
of
crept
over
me
while
i
sat
waiting
in
an
ugly
little
bare
stuffy
reception
room
my
head
was
going
round
and
round
my
heart
was
pounding
so
that
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
what
to
say
to
ivor
when
he
came
then
suddenly
i
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
outside
the
door
and
when
it
opened
there
stood
ivor
between
two
frenchmen
in
blue
uniforms
one
of
them
walked
into
the
room
with
him
i
suppose
he
must
have
been
a
warder
but
he
stopped
near
the
door
and
in
a
second
i
had
forgotten
all
about
him
he
simply
ceased
to
exist
for
me
when
my
eyes
and
ivor
had
met
i
sprang
up
from
my
chair
and
began
to
talk
as
quickly
as
i
could
stammering
and
confused
hardly
knowing
what
i
said
but
anxious
to
make
him
understand
in
the
beginning
that
i
had
not
come
to
take
back
my
words
of
yesterday
we
all
so
dreadfully
sorry
dundas
i
said
i
do
know
if
uncle
eric
has
been
here
yet
but
he
is
doing
all
he
can
and
aunt
lilian
is
dreadfully
upset
we
staying
on
in
paris
on
account
of
on
account
of
this
so
you
see
you
got
friends
near
you
and
i
such
old
friends
i
could
help
trying
as
hard
as
i
could
for
a
sight
of
you
to
to
cheer
you
up
and
and
to
help
you
if
that
possible
i
spoke
very
fast
not
daring
to
look
at
him
after
the
first
but
pretending
to
smooth
out
some
wrinkles
in
one
of
my
long
gloves
my
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
i
was
afraid
they
go
splashing
down
my
cheeks
if
i
even
winked
my
lashes
i
loved
him
more
than
ever
now
and
felt
capable
of
forgiving
him
anything
if
only
i
had
the
chance
to
forgive
and
if
only
he
really
loved
me
and
not
that
other
thank
you
a
hundred
times
more
than
i
can
express
he
said
with
a
faint
quiver
in
his
voice
his
beautiful
voice
which
was
the
first
thing
that
charmed
me
after
knowing
him
it
cheer
me
to
see
you
it
gives
me
strength
and
courage
you
would
have
come
if
you
did
trust
me
and
believe
me
innocent
why
of
course
i
we
believe
you
innocent
of
any
crime
i
faltered
and
of
any
lack
of
faith
oh
as
for
that
how
can
but
do
let
speak
of
that
what
can
it
matter
now
it
matters
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
if
only
you
could
say
that
you
will
have
faith
i
try
to
say
it
then
if
it
can
give
you
any
comfort
not
unless
you
mean
it
then
i
try
to
mean
it
will
that
satisfy
you
it
better
than
nothing
and
i
thank
you
again
as
for
the
rest
you
not
to
be
anxious
everything
will
come
right
for
me
sooner
or
later
though
i
may
have
to
suffer
some
annoyances
first
annoyances
i
echoed
if
there
were
nothing
worse
there
wo
be
i
shall
be
well
defended
it
will
all
be
shown
up
as
a
huge
mistake
another
warning
against
trusting
to
circumstantial
evidence
is
there
nothing
we
can
do
then
or
that
we
would
urge
to
do
i
asked
hoping
he
would
understand
that
i
meant
other
maxine
de
renzie
i
guessed
by
his
look
that
he
did
understand
it
was
a
look
of
gloom
but
suddenly
a
light
flashed
in
his
eyes
there
is
one
thing
could
do
for
me
you
and
no
one
else
he
said
but
i
have
no
right
to
ask
it
tell
me
what
it
is
i
implored
i
would
not
if
it
did
mean
more
than
my
life
to
me
he
hesitated
and
then
while
i
wondered
what
was
to
come
he
bent
forward
and
spoke
a
few
hurried
words
in
spanish
he
knew
that
to
me
spanish
was
almost
as
familiar
as
english
he
had
heard
me
talk
of
the
spanish
customs
still
existing
in
the
part
of
california
where
i
was
born
he
had
heard
me
sing
spanish
songs
we
had
sung
them
together
one
or
two
i
had
taught
him
but
i
had
not
taught
him
the
language
he
learned
that
and
three
or
four
others
at
least
as
a
boy
when
first
he
thought
of
taking
up
a
diplomatic
career
they
were
so
few
words
and
so
quickly
spoken
that
i
remembering
the
warder
almost
hoped
they
might
pass
unnoticed
but
the
man
in
uniform
came
nearer
to
us
at
once
looking
angry
and
suspicious
that
is
forbidden
he
said
to
ivor
then
turning
sharply
to
me
what
language
was
that
spanish
i
answered
he
only
bade
me
we
have
been
very
dear
friends
and
there
was
a
misunderstanding
but
it
over
now
it
was
natural
he
should
want
you
to
hear
his
last
words
to
me
nevertheless
it
is
forbidden
repeated
the
warder
obstinately
and
though
the
five
minutes
you
were
granted
together
are
not
over
yet
the
prisoner
must
go
with
me
now
he
has
forfeited
the
rest
of
his
time
and
must
be
reported
with
this
he
ordered
ivor
to
leave
the
room
in
a
tone
which
sounded
to
me
so
brutal
that
i
should
have
liked
him
to
be
shot
and
the
whole
french
police
force
exterminated
to
hear
a
little
underbred
policeman
dare
to
speak
like
that
to
my
big
brave
handsome
englishman
and
to
know
that
it
would
be
childish
and
undignified
of
ivor
to
resist
oh
i
could
have
killed
the
creature
with
my
own
hands
i
think
as
for
ivor
he
said
not
another
word
except
smiling
half
sadly
half
with
a
twinkle
of
grim
humour
then
he
went
out
with
his
head
high
and
just
at
the
door
he
threw
me
back
one
look
it
said
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
spoken
remember
i
know
you
wo
fail
me
i
did
indeed
remember
and
i
prayed
that
i
should
have
pluck
and
courage
not
to
fail
but
it
was
a
very
hard
thing
that
he
had
asked
me
to
do
and
he
had
said
well
in
saying
that
he
would
not
ask
it
of
me
if
it
did
not
mean
more
than
his
life
the
words
he
had
whispered
so
hastily
and
unexpectedly
in
spanish
were
these
go
to
the
room
of
the
murder
alone
and
on
the
window
balcony
find
in
a
box
under
a
folded
document
take
this
to
maxine
every
moment
counts
so
it
seemed
that
it
was
always
of
her
he
thought
of
maxine
de
renzie
and
i
of
all
people
in
the
world
was
to
help
him
with
her
as
i
thought
of
this
task
he
set
me
and
of
all
it
meant
it
appeared
more
and
more
incredible
that
he
should
have
had
the
heart
to
ask
such
a
thing
of
me
but
it
meant
more
than
his
life
and
i
would
do
the
thing
if
it
could
be
done
because
of
my
pride
as
i
drove
away
from
the
prison
a
kind
of
fury
grew
in
me
and
possessed
me
i
felt
as
if
i
had
fire
instead
of
blood
in
my
veins
if
i
had
known
that
death
or
worse
than
death
waited
for
me
in
the
ghastly
house
to
which
ivor
had
sent
me
i
would
still
have
gone
there
my
first
thought
was
to
go
instantly
and
get
it
over
with
success
or
failure
but
calmer
thoughts
prevailed
i
had
looked
at
the
papers
yet
my
only
knowledge
of
last
dreadful
happenings
had
come
from
uncle
eric
and
lord
robert
west
i
had
said
to
myself
that
i
did
wish
to
read
the
newspaper
accounts
of
the
murder
and
of
ivor
supposed
part
in
it
i
remembered
now
however
that
i
did
not
even
know
in
what
part
of
paris
the
house
of
the
murder
was
i
recalled
only
the
name
of
the
street
because
it
was
a
curiously
grim
one
like
the
tragedy
that
had
been
acted
in
it
i
could
tell
the
chaffeur
to
drive
me
to
the
street
and
house
that
would
be
a
stupid
thing
to
do
i
must
search
the
papers
and
find
out
from
them
something
about
the
neighbourhood
for
there
would
surely
be
plenty
of
details
of
that
sort
and
i
must
do
this
without
first
going
back
to
the
hotel
as
it
might
be
very
difficult
to
get
away
again
once
i
was
there
now
nobody
knew
where
i
was
and
i
was
free
to
do
as
i
pleased
no
matter
what
the
consequences
might
be
afterwards
passing
a
duval
restaurant
i
suddenly
ordered
my
to
stop
having
paid
and
sent
it
away
i
went
upstairs
and
asked
for
a
cup
of
chocolate
at
one
of
the
little
deadly
marble
tables
also
i
asked
to
see
an
evening
paper
it
was
a
shock
to
find
ivor
photograph
horribly
reproduced
gazing
at
me
from
the
front
page
the
photograph
was
an
old
one
which
had
been
a
good
deal
shown
in
shop
windows
much
to
ivor
disgust
at
about
the
time
when
he
returned
from
his
great
expedition
and
published
his
really
wonderful
book
i
had
seen
it
before
i
met
him
and
as
it
must
have
been
on
sale
in
paris
as
well
as
london
it
had
been
easy
enough
for
the
newspaper
people
to
get
it
then
there
came
the
story
of
the
murder
built
up
dramatically
hating
it
sickened
by
it
i
yet
read
it
all
i
knew
where
to
go
to
find
the
house
and
i
knew
that
the
murder
had
been
committed
in
a
back
room
on
the
top
floor
also
i
saw
the
picture
of
the
window
with
the
balcony
ivor
was
supposed
according
to
girard
the
detective
to
have
tried
in
vain
to
escape
by
way
of
this
high
balcony
on
hearing
sounds
outside
the
door
while
busy
in
searching
the
dead
man
room
girard
said
that
he
had
seen
him
first
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
which
he
girard
carried
standing
at
bay
in
the
open
window
there
was
a
photograph
of
this
window
taken
from
outside
there
was
the
balcony
and
there
was
the
balcony
of
another
window
with
another
balcony
just
like
it
on
the
adjoining
house
i
looked
at
the
picture
and
judged
that
there
would
not
be
more
than
two
feet
of
distance
between
the
railings
of
those
two
balconies
that
would
be
my
way
to
get
there
if
i
can
get
there
at
all
i
said
to
myself
but
there
was
hardly
any
if
left
in
my
mind
now
i
meant
to
get
there
by
this
time
it
was
after
five
i
left
the
duval
restaurant
and
again
took
a
cab
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
send
a
to
aunt
lilian
saying
that
she
was
to
worry
about
me
i
been
hipped
and
nervous
and
had
gone
out
to
see
a
friend
who
was
i
just
found
out
staying
in
paris
perhaps
i
should
stop
with
the
friend
to
dinner
but
at
latest
i
should
be
back
by
nine
or
ten
that
would
save
a
bother
at
the
hotel
for
aunt
lilian
knew
i
had
heaps
of
american
friends
who
came
every
year
to
paris
yet
no
one
would
know
where
to
search
for
me
even
if
they
were
inclined
next
i
drove
to
a
street
near
the
rue
de
la
fille
sauvage
and
dismissed
my
cab
i
asked
for
no
directions
but
after
one
or
two
mistakes
found
the
street
i
wanted
instead
of
going
to
the
house
of
the
murder
i
passed
on
to
the
next
house
on
the
left
the
house
of
the
balcony
almost
adjoining
the
dead
man
i
rang
the
bell
for
the
concierge
and
asked
him
if
there
were
any
rooms
to
let
in
the
house
i
knew
already
that
there
were
for
i
could
see
the
advertisement
of
à
staring
me
in
the
face
but
i
spoke
french
as
badly
as
i
could
making
three
mistakes
to
every
sentence
and
begged
the
man
to
talk
slowly
in
answering
me
there
were
several
rooms
to
be
had
it
appeared
but
it
would
have
been
too
good
to
be
true
that
the
one
i
wanted
should
be
empty
after
we
had
jabbered
awhile
i
made
the
concierge
understand
that
i
was
a
young
american
journalist
employed
by
a
new
york
paper
i
wanted
to
write
up
the
murder
of
last
night
according
to
my
own
ideas
and
as
of
course
the
police
would
let
me
go
into
the
room
where
it
happened
the
next
best
thing
would
be
to
take
the
room
close
to
it
in
the
house
adjoining
i
wanted
to
be
there
only
long
enough
to
get
the
emotion
the
sensation
i
explained
so
as
to
make
my
article
really
dramatic
would
the
people
who
occupied
that
room
let
it
to
me
for
a
few
hours
long
before
bedtime
they
could
have
it
back
again
if
i
got
on
well
with
my
writing
the
concierge
to
whom
i
gave
ten
francs
as
a
kind
of
retaining
fee
was
almost
sure
the
occupants
of
the
room
an
old
man
and
his
wife
would
willingly
agree
to
such
a
proposal
if
i
paid
them
well
enough
for
their
trouble
in
turning
out
would
three
louis
be
enough
i
asked
the
concierge
whose
eyes
brightened
thought
that
it
would
i
knew
by
his
look
that
he
would
take
a
large
commission
for
managing
the
affair
as
he
quickly
offered
to
do
but
that
did
matter
to
me
he
confirmed
my
idea
that
it
would
have
been
hopeless
to
try
and
get
into
the
room
of
the
murder
itself
even
if
i
could
have
borne
it
saying
that
the
door
and
window
too
had
been
sealed
by
the
police
who
were
also
guarding
the
house
from
curiosity
seekers
but
he
added
that
i
could
see
the
shut
window
from
the
balcony
of
the
room
i
was
going
to
hire
i
waited
for
him
and
played
with
his
very
unattractive
baby
while
he
went
upstairs
to
make
enquiries
he
was
gone
for
some
time
explaining
to
the
people
but
at
last
when
my
patience
was
almost
too
far
strained
he
came
back
to
say
that
monsieur
and
madame
nissot
had
consented
to
go
out
of
their
room
for
the
evening
they
were
dining
at
the
moment
however
and
mademoiselle
must
be
pleased
to
wait
a
few
moments
until
they
finished
the
meal
and
gathered
up
a
few
things
which
they
could
carry
to
a
neighbour
books
and
work
for
their
hours
of
absence
the
concierge
politely
suggested
but
that
was
to
save
my
feelings
no
doubt
for
i
was
sure
the
husband
and
wife
meant
to
make
a
parcel
of
any
valuables
which
could
possibly
be
carried
off
by
an
unscrupulous
american
journalist
also
they
stipulated
that
payment
must
be
made
in
advance
to
this
i
agreed
willingly
and
then
i
waited
waited
it
was
tedious
but
after
all
the
tediousness
did
matter
much
when
i
came
to
think
of
it
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
the
thing
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
do
till
after
dark
maxine
de
renzie
part
chapter
xvii
maxine
makes
a
bargain
we
looked
everywhere
in
all
possible
places
for
the
diamond
necklace
raoul
and
i
and
to
him
poor
fellow
its
second
loss
seemed
overwhelming
he
did
not
see
in
glaring
scarlet
letters
always
before
his
eyes
these
two
words
the
treaty
as
i
did
for
my
punishment
he
was
in
happy
ignorance
still
of
that
other
loss
which
i
i
to
whom
his
honour
should
have
been
sacred
had
inflicted
upon
him
he
was
satisfied
with
my
story
that
through
a
person
employed
by
me
a
person
whose
name
could
not
yet
be
mentioned
even
to
him
the
necklace
had
been
snatched
from
the
thief
who
had
stolen
it
he
blamed
himself
mercilessly
for
thinking
so
little
of
the
brocade
bag
which
i
had
given
him
at
parting
for
letting
all
remembrance
of
my
words
concerning
it
be
put
out
of
his
mind
by
his
wicked
jealousy
as
he
repentantly
called
it
for
me
he
had
nothing
but
praise
and
gratitude
for
what
i
had
done
for
him
he
begged
me
to
forgive
him
and
his
remorse
for
such
a
small
thing
comparatively
wrung
my
heart
we
searched
the
garden
and
the
whole
street
then
came
back
to
search
the
little
for
the
second
time
in
vain
it
did
seem
that
there
was
witchcraft
in
it
as
i
said
to
raoul
but
at
last
i
persuaded
him
to
go
away
and
follow
his
own
track
wherever
he
had
been
since
i
gave
him
the
bag
with
the
diamonds
it
was
just
possible
as
it
was
so
late
and
his
way
had
led
him
through
quiet
streets
that
even
after
all
this
time
the
little
brocade
bag
might
be
lying
where
he
had
left
it
or
that
some
honest
policeman
on
his
beat
might
have
picked
it
up
besides
there
was
the
cab
in
which
he
had
come
part
of
the
distance
to
my
house
the
bag
might
have
fallen
on
the
floor
while
he
drove
and
there
were
many
honest
cabmen
in
paris
i
reminded
him
trying
to
be
as
cheerful
as
i
could
so
he
left
me
and
i
was
deadly
tired
but
i
had
no
thought
of
sleep
no
wish
for
it
when
i
had
unlocked
the
door
of
my
boudoir
and
found
ivor
dundas
gone
as
i
had
hoped
he
would
be
the
next
hope
born
in
my
heart
was
that
he
might
by
and
by
come
back
or
send
with
news
hour
after
hour
of
deadly
suspense
passed
on
and
he
did
not
come
or
make
any
sign
at
five
marianne
who
had
flitted
about
all
night
like
a
restless
ghost
made
me
drink
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
and
actually
put
me
to
bed
my
last
words
to
her
were
what
is
the
use
i
ca
sleep
it
will
be
worse
to
lie
and
toss
in
a
fever
than
sit
up
yet
i
did
sleep
and
heavily
she
will
always
deny
it
i
know
but
sure
she
must
have
slyly
slipped
a
into
the
chocolate
i
was
far
too
much
occupied
with
my
own
thoughts
as
i
drank
to
please
her
to
think
whether
or
no
there
was
anything
at
all
peculiar
in
the
taste
be
that
as
it
may
i
slept
and
when
i
waked
suddenly
starting
out
of
a
hateful
dream
yet
scarcely
worse
than
realities
to
my
horror
it
was
nearly
noon
i
was
wild
with
fear
lest
the
servants
in
their
stupid
but
wish
not
to
disturb
me
might
have
sent
important
visitors
away
however
when
marianne
came
flying
in
in
answer
to
my
long
peal
of
the
electric
bell
she
said
that
no
one
had
been
there
were
letters
and
one
telegram
and
all
the
morning
papers
as
usual
after
the
first
night
of
a
new
play
my
heart
gave
a
spring
at
the
news
that
there
was
a
telegram
for
i
thought
it
might
be
from
ivor
saying
he
was
on
the
track
of
the
treaty
even
if
he
had
yet
got
hold
of
it
but
the
message
was
from
raoul
and
he
had
not
found
the
brocade
bag
he
did
not
put
this
in
so
many
words
but
said
i
have
not
found
what
was
lost
or
learned
anything
of
it
from
ivor
there
was
not
a
line
and
i
thought
this
cruel
he
might
have
wired
or
written
me
a
note
even
if
there
were
nothing
definite
to
say
he
might
unless
something
had
happened
to
him
there
was
that
to
think
of
and
i
did
think
of
it
with
dread
and
a
growing
presentiment
that
i
had
not
suffered
yet
all
i
was
to
suffer
i
determined
to
send
a
servant
to
the
élysée
palace
hotel
to
enquire
for
him
and
despatched
henri
immediately
meanwhile
as
there
was
nothing
to
do
after
pretending
to
eat
breakfast
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
marianne
i
pretended
also
to
read
the
newspaper
notices
of
the
play
but
each
sentence
went
out
of
my
head
before
i
had
begun
the
next
i
knew
in
the
end
only
that
according
to
all
the
critics
maxine
de
renzie
had
surpassed
herself
had
been
astonishingly
great
had
done
what
no
woman
could
do
unless
she
threw
her
whole
soul
into
her
part
how
little
they
knew
where
maxine
de
renzie
soul
had
been
last
night
and
only
god
knew
where
it
might
be
this
night
out
of
her
body
perhaps
the
one
way
of
escape
from
hatred
if
he
had
come
to
know
the
truth
of
course
the
enquiry
at
the
hotel
was
not
for
ivor
dundas
but
for
the
name
he
had
adopted
there
yet
when
my
servant
came
back
to
me
he
had
nothing
to
tell
which
was
consoling
rather
the
other
way
the
gentleman
had
gone
out
about
midnight
i
knew
that
already
and
had
returned
since
henri
had
been
to
the
bureau
to
ask
and
it
had
struck
him
he
admitted
to
me
on
being
catechised
that
his
questions
had
been
answered
with
a
certain
reserve
as
if
more
were
known
of
the
absent
movements
than
it
was
considered
wise
to
tell
my
servant
had
not
been
long
away
though
it
seemed
long
to
me
and
he
had
delayed
only
to
buy
all
the
evening
papers
which
he
thought
that
mademoiselle
would
like
to
see
as
they
were
sure
to
be
filled
with
praise
of
her
great
acting
it
was
on
my
tongue
to
scold
him
for
stopping
even
one
moment
when
he
had
been
told
to
hurry
but
he
looked
so
pleased
at
his
own
cleverness
that
i
had
the
heart
to
dash
his
happiness
i
would
however
have
pushed
the
papers
aside
without
so
much
as
glancing
at
them
if
it
had
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
if
any
accident
had
befallen
ivor
news
of
it
might
possibly
have
got
into
print
by
this
time
when
i
read
what
had
happened
how
he
was
accused
of
murder
and
while
declaring
his
innocence
had
been
silent
as
to
all
those
events
which
might
have
proved
it
my
heart
went
out
to
him
in
a
wave
of
gratitude
here
was
a
man
a
man
loyal
and
brave
and
chivalrous
as
all
men
ought
to
be
but
few
are
he
had
sacrificed
himself
to
the
death
no
doubt
to
keep
my
name
out
of
the
mud
into
which
my
business
had
thrown
him
and
to
save
me
from
appearing
in
raoul
eyes
the
liar
that
i
was
had
ivor
told
that
he
was
with
me
after
i
had
prevaricated
if
i
had
not
actually
lied
to
raoul
about
the
midnight
visitor
to
my
house
what
would
raoul
think
of
me
ivor
was
trying
to
save
me
if
he
could
and
he
had
been
trying
to
save
me
when
he
went
to
the
room
of
that
dead
man
though
how
and
when
he
had
decided
to
go
i
knew
not
if
it
were
not
for
me
he
would
be
free
and
happy
my
conscience
cried
out
that
the
one
thing
to
do
was
to
go
at
once
to
the
chief
of
police
and
say
monsieur
this
english
gentleman
they
have
arrested
can
not
have
committed
a
murder
in
the
rue
de
la
fille
sauvage
between
twelve
and
one
last
night
for
he
came
to
my
house
far
away
in
the
rue
at
a
quarter
past
twelve
and
did
leave
it
till
after
one
i
even
sprang
up
from
my
chair
in
the
very
room
where
i
had
hidden
ivor
to
ring
for
marianne
and
tell
her
to
bring
me
a
hat
and
coat
to
bid
her
order
my
electric
brougham
immediately
but
i
sat
down
again
sick
and
despairing
deliberately
crushing
the
generous
impulse
i
could
obey
it
i
dared
not
by
and
by
perhaps
if
ivor
should
be
in
real
pressing
danger
then
certainly
but
not
now
at
four
raoul
came
and
was
with
me
for
an
hour
each
of
us
tried
to
cheer
the
other
i
did
all
i
could
to
make
him
hope
that
even
yet
he
would
have
news
of
the
brocade
bag
and
its
contents
he
thinking
me
ill
and
tired
out
did
all
he
could
to
persuade
me
that
he
was
not
miserable
with
anxiety
at
least
he
was
no
longer
jealous
of
godensky
or
of
any
man
and
was
humbly
repentant
for
his
suspicions
of
me
the
night
before
when
raoul
is
repentant
and
wishes
to
atone
for
something
that
he
has
done
he
is
enchanting
there
was
never
a
man
like
him
at
five
i
sent
him
away
with
the
excuse
that
i
must
rest
as
i
slept
much
the
night
before
but
really
it
was
because
i
feared
lest
i
should
disgrace
myself
before
him
by
breaking
down
and
giving
him
a
fright
or
perhaps
even
by
being
mad
enough
to
confess
the
thing
i
had
done
i
felt
that
i
was
no
longer
mistress
of
myself
that
i
might
be
capable
of
any
folly
i
could
not
eat
but
i
drank
a
little
before
starting
for
the
theatre
where
i
went
earlier
than
usual
it
would
be
something
to
be
busy
and
in
my
part
i
might
even
forget
for
a
moment
now
and
then
marianne
and
i
were
in
my
before
seven
i
insisted
on
dressing
at
once
and
took
as
long
as
i
could
in
the
process
of
making
up
still
when
i
was
ready
there
was
more
than
half
an
hour
to
spare
before
the
first
act
there
were
letters
for
me
the
kind
that
always
come
to
the
theatre
but
i
could
read
them
after
i
had
occupied
myself
with
tearing
open
the
envelopes
i
knew
what
they
would
be
vows
of
adoration
from
strangers
poems
by
budding
poets
petitions
for
advice
from
girls
and
young
men
who
wanted
to
go
on
the
stage
requests
from
artists
who
wanted
to
paint
my
picture
there
were
always
such
things
every
night
especially
after
the
opening
of
a
new
play
i
was
still
aimlessly
breaking
fantastic
seals
and
staring
unseeingly
at
crests
and
coronets
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
marianne
opened
it
to
speak
for
a
moment
with
the
stage
door
keeper
mademoiselle
she
whispered
coming
to
me
monsieur
le
comte
godensky
wishes
to
see
you
shall
i
say
you
are
not
receiving
i
thought
for
a
moment
better
see
him
perhaps
i
might
learn
something
if
not
if
he
had
only
come
to
torture
me
uselessly
to
please
himself
i
would
soon
find
out
and
could
send
him
away
i
went
into
my
little
adjoining
and
received
him
there
he
advanced
smiling
as
one
advances
to
a
friend
of
whose
welcome
one
is
sure
well
i
asked
abruptly
when
the
door
was
shut
and
we
were
alone
he
held
out
his
hand
but
i
put
mine
behind
me
and
drew
back
a
step
when
he
had
come
too
close
well
i
have
news
for
you
that
no
one
else
could
bring
so
i
thought
you
would
be
glad
to
see
even
me
he
answered
smiling
still
what
news
but
bad
of
course
or
you
would
bring
it
you
are
very
cruel
of
course
you
seen
the
evening
papers
you
know
that
your
english
friend
is
in
prison
the
same
english
friend
whom
would
have
liked
to
see
arrested
early
last
evening
on
a
ridiculous
baseless
charge
i
flung
at
him
you
look
surprised
but
you
are
surprised
count
godensky
except
perhaps
that
i
should
guess
who
had
me
spied
upon
at
the
élysée
palace
hotel
a
disappointment
that
affair
was
it
but
you
have
told
me
your
news
it
is
this
that
ivor
dundas
of
england
has
been
on
the
rack
what
do
you
mean
he
has
been
in
the
hands
of
the
juge
it
is
much
the
same
is
it
if
one
has
secrets
to
keep
would
you
like
to
know
if
some
magical
bird
could
tell
you
what
questions
were
put
to
dundas
and
what
answers
he
made
strange
that
this
very
thought
had
been
torturing
me
before
godensky
came
i
had
been
thinking
of
the
juge
and
his
terrible
which
only
a
man
of
steel
or
iron
can
answer
without
trembling
i
had
thought
that
questions
had
been
asked
and
answers
given
which
might
mean
everything
to
me
if
i
could
only
have
heard
them
could
it
be
that
i
was
to
hear
now
but
i
reminded
myself
that
this
was
impossible
no
one
could
know
except
the
juge
and
ivor
dundas
himself
only
two
men
were
present
at
that
scene
and
they
will
never
tell
what
went
on
i
said
aloud
three
men
were
present
godensky
answered
besides
the
two
of
whom
you
think
there
was
another
a
lawyer
who
speaks
english
it
is
permitted
nowadays
that
a
foreigner
if
he
demands
it
can
be
accompanied
by
his
legal
adviser
when
he
goes
before
the
juge
otherwise
his
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
language
might
handicap
him
and
cause
misunderstandings
which
would
prejudice
his
case
he
paused
a
moment
but
i
did
not
reply
i
knew
that
ivor
dundas
spoke
french
as
well
as
i
but
i
was
not
going
to
tell
this
russian
that
fact
the
adviser
your
friend
has
chosen
godensky
went
on
happens
to
be
a
protégé
of
mine
i
made
him
gave
him
his
first
case
his
first
success
and
have
employed
him
more
than
once
since
odd
what
a
penchant
dundas
seems
to
have
for
men
in
whom
i
too
have
confidence
last
night
it
was
girard
it
is
lenormand
this
was
a
blow
and
a
heavy
one
but
i
would
let
godensky
see
that
i
winced
under
it
you
keep
yourself
singularly
of
the
movements
of
your
various
protégés
i
said
as
well
as
those
of
your
enemies
but
if
the
information
in
the
one
case
is
no
more
trustworthy
than
in
the
other
why
you
not
faithfully
served
i
good
reason
to
know
that
you
made
several
mistakes
lately
and
you
likely
to
make
more
thanks
for
the
warning
but
i
hope
you
do
call
yourself
my
i
do
know
of
a
more
appropriate
name
after
the
baseness
that
you
have
even
tried
to
hide
in
your
dealings
with
me
i
thought
all
was
fair
in
love
and
war
do
you
make
war
on
women
no
i
make
love
to
them
to
many
i
dare
say
but
here
is
one
who
wo
listen
at
least
you
will
listen
while
i
go
on
with
the
news
i
came
to
tell
oh
yes
i
confess
to
being
curious
no
doubt
what
you
say
will
be
interesting
even
if
not
accurate
i
can
promise
that
it
shall
be
both
i
called
on
lenormand
as
soon
as
i
learned
what
had
happened
that
he
been
mixed
up
in
this
case
and
expressed
myself
as
extremely
concerned
for
the
fate
of
his
client
friends
of
whom
were
intimate
friends
of
mine
so
you
see
there
was
no
question
of
treachery
on
lenormand
part
he
trusts
me
as
you
do
not
indeed
i
even
offered
my
help
for
dundas
if
i
could
give
it
consistently
with
my
position
naturally
he
told
me
nothing
which
could
be
used
against
dundas
so
far
as
he
knew
even
if
i
wished
to
go
against
him
which
my
coming
here
ought
to
prove
to
you
that
i
do
not
i
read
the
proof
rather
differently
i
said
but
go
on
i
sure
you
are
anxious
to
tell
me
certain
things
please
come
to
the
point
in
a
few
words
then
the
point
is
this
one
of
the
most
important
questions
put
by
the
juge
after
hearing
from
dundas
the
explanation
of
a
document
found
on
him
by
the
police
ah
that
wakes
you
up
mademoiselle
you
are
surprised
that
a
document
was
found
on
the
prisoner
i
was
half
fainting
with
fear
lest
ivor
had
regained
the
treaty
only
to
lose
it
again
in
this
dreadful
way
but
i
controlled
myself
i
rather
hope
it
was
not
a
letter
from
me
i
said
you
know
so
much
that
you
probably
know
i
admitted
to
the
police
at
the
élysée
palace
a
strong
friendship
for
dundas
we
knew
each
other
well
in
london
but
london
ways
are
different
from
the
ways
of
paris
it
is
agreeable
to
be
gossipped
about
however
unjustly
even
if
one
is
only
an
actress
you
turn
things
cleverly
as
always
yes
you
are
afraid
there
might
have
been
a
letter
yet
the
public
adores
you
it
would
pardon
you
any
indiscretion
especially
a
romantic
one
any
indiscretion
there
might
however
be
a
few
persons
less
indulgent
du
laurier
for
instance
i
shivered
we
were
speaking
of
the
scene
with
the
juge
i
reminded
him
you
have
wandered
from
the
point
again
there
are
so
many
points
all
sharp
as
swords
for
those
they
may
pierce
well
the
important
question
was
in
relation
to
a
letter
yes
but
the
letter
was
not
from
you
mademoiselle
it
was
written
in
english
and
it
made
an
appointment
at
the
very
address
where
the
crime
was
committed
it
was
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
out
a
request
from
a
person
calling
himself
a
jeweller
assistant
for
the
receiver
of
the
letter
to
call
and
return
a
case
containing
jewels
this
case
had
been
committed
to
dundas
care
it
appeared
while
travelling
from
london
to
paris
and
without
his
knowledge
another
packet
being
taken
away
to
make
room
for
this
dundas
replied
to
the
juge
that
his
own
packet
stolen
from
him
on
the
journey
contained
nothing
but
papers
personal
concerning
himself
alone
was
in
the
case
which
the
man
afterwards
murdered
slipped
into
your
pocket
asked
the
juge
lenormand
tells
me
necklace
answered
dundas
necklace
of
diamonds
diamonds
possibly
paste
i
was
much
interested
in
it
was
this
not
the
necklace
which
you
staying
at
the
élysée
palace
under
another
name
gave
to
mademoiselle
maxine
de
renzie
last
evening
was
the
next
question
thrown
suddenly
at
dundas
head
now
you
see
mademoiselle
that
my
story
is
not
dull
am
i
to
hear
the
rest
according
to
your
protégé
i
asked
twisting
my
handkerchief
as
i
should
have
liked
to
twist
godensky
neck
till
he
had
no
more
breath
or
wickedness
left
in
him
dundas
tried
his
best
to
convince
the
juge
a
most
clever
and
experienced
man
that
if
he
had
as
an
old
friend
brought
you
a
present
of
diamonds
it
was
something
entirely
different
and
therefore
far
removed
from
this
case
you
not
mademoiselle
de
renzie
lover
was
the
next
enquiry
admire
her
as
do
thousands
of
others
who
also
respect
her
as
i
do
your
friend
returned
very
prettily
at
last
dearest
lady
you
begin
to
see
what
there
is
in
this
string
of
questions
and
answers
to
bring
me
straight
to
you
no
count
godensky
i
do
not
i
answered
steadily
but
a
sudden
illuminating
ray
did
show
me
even
as
i
spoke
what
be
in
his
scheming
mind
then
i
must
be
clear
and
above
all
frank
du
laurier
loves
you
you
love
him
you
mean
i
think
to
marry
him
but
deeply
in
love
as
he
is
he
is
a
very
proud
fellow
he
will
have
all
or
nothing
if
i
judge
him
well
and
he
would
not
take
for
his
wife
a
woman
who
accepts
diamonds
from
another
man
saying
as
she
takes
them
that
he
is
her
lover
he
would
believe
it
of
me
i
cried
there
is
a
way
of
convincing
him
oh
shall
not
tell
him
but
he
shall
see
in
writing
all
that
passed
between
the
juge
and
dundas
unless
unless
but
i
know
what
you
mean
to
threaten
you
repeat
yourself
not
quite
for
i
have
new
arguments
and
stronger
ones
i
want
you
maxine
i
mean
to
have
you
or
i
will
crush
you
and
now
you
know
i
can
choose
i
sprang
up
and
looked
at
him
perhaps
there
was
murder
in
my
eyes
as
for
a
moment
there
was
in
my
heart
for
he
exclaimed
tigeress
you
would
kill
me
if
you
could
but
that
does
make
me
love
you
less
would
du
laurier
have
you
if
he
knew
what
you
are
as
he
will
know
soon
unless
you
let
me
save
you
yet
i
i
would
love
you
if
you
were
a
murderess
as
well
as
a
spy
it
is
you
who
are
a
spy
i
faltered
now
all
but
broken
if
i
am
i
have
spied
in
vain
not
only
can
i
ruin
you
with
du
laurier
and
before
the
world
but
i
can
ruin
him
utterly
and
in
all
ways
no
no
i
gasped
you
can
not
you
boasting
you
can
do
nothing
nothing
perhaps
i
not
speaking
of
i
am
giving
you
time
but
or
the
day
after
it
much
the
same
to
me
at
first
when
i
began
to
suspect
that
something
had
been
taken
from
its
place
i
had
no
proof
i
had
to
get
that
and
i
did
get
it
nearly
all
i
wanted
this
affair
of
dundas
might
have
been
planned
for
my
advantage
it
is
perfect
all
its
complications
are
just
so
many
links
in
a
chain
for
me
girard
the
man
dundas
chose
to
employ
was
the
very
man
sent
to
england
on
what
errand
do
you
think
to
watch
your
friend
the
british
foreign
secretary
he
followed
dundas
to
paris
on
the
bare
suspicion
that
there
been
communication
between
the
two
and
he
was
preparing
a
report
for
me
when
dundas
called
on
him
what
connection
can
ivor
dundas
coming
to
paris
have
with
raoul
du
laurier
i
dared
to
ask
you
know
best
as
to
that
they
have
never
met
both
are
men
of
honour
and
men
of
honour
are
tricked
by
women
sometimes
and
then
they
have
to
suffer
for
being
fools
as
if
they
had
been
villains
think
what
such
a
man
a
man
of
honour
as
you
say
would
feel
when
he
found
out
the
woman
a
woman
can
be
calumniated
as
well
as
a
man
i
said
you
are
so
unscrupulous
you
would
stoop
to
anything
i
know
that
raoul
du
laurier
has
done
nothing
i
i
have
done
nothing
of
which
to
be
ashamed
yet
you
can
lie
about
us
ruin
him
perhaps
by
a
plot
as
if
he
were
guilty
and
and
do
terrible
harm
to
me
i
can
without
the
trouble
of
lying
and
i
will
unless
you
give
up
du
laurier
and
make
up
your
mind
to
marry
me
i
always
meant
to
have
you
you
are
the
one
woman
worthy
of
me
you
are
the
man
most
unworthy
of
any
woman
but
give
me
till
evening
at
this
time
to
decide
will
you
promise
me
that
no
i
know
what
you
would
do
you
would
kill
yourself
it
is
what
is
in
your
mind
now
i
wo
risk
losing
you
i
have
waited
long
enough
already
give
me
a
ring
of
yours
and
a
written
word
from
you
to
du
laurier
saying
that
you
find
you
have
made
a
mistake
and
not
only
will
i
do
nothing
to
injure
him
but
will
guard
against
the
discovery
of
you
know
what
besides
as
a
matter
of
course
i
bring
all
my
influence
to
bear
in
keeping
your
name
out
of
this
or
any
other
scandal
i
can
do
much
everything
indeed
for
i
admit
that
it
was
through
me
the
commissary
of
police
trapped
you
with
dundas
i
will
say
that
i
blundered
i
know
what
to
do
to
save
you
and
i
will
do
it
for
my
future
wife
no
power
on
earth
could
induce
me
to
break
with
raoul
du
laurier
in
the
way
you
wish
i
said
if
if
i
am
to
give
him
up
i
must
tell
him
with
my
own
lips
and
bid
him
i
will
do
this
if
you
will
hold
your
hand
until
then
we
looked
at
each
other
for
a
long
moment
in
silence
godensky
was
trying
to
read
my
mind
and
to
make
up
his
accordingly
you
swear
by
everything
you
hold
sacred
to
break
with
him
by
the
memory
of
my
father
and
mother
martyred
by
bureaucrats
like
you
i
pledge
my
word
that
that
if
i
ca
break
with
raoul
to
let
you
know
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
dare
you
to
do
what
you
will
you
will
not
me
i
think
and
because
i
think
so
i
will
wait
a
little
longer
until
this
time
no
for
if
you
cheated
me
it
would
be
too
late
to
act
for
another
twelve
hours
but
i
will
give
you
till
noon
you
agree
to
that
i
agree
my
lips
formed
the
words
i
hardly
spoke
them
but
he
understood
and
with
a
flash
in
his
eyes
took
a
step
towards
me
as
if
to
snatch
my
hand
i
drew
away
he
followed
but
at
this
instant
marianne
appeared
at
the
door
there
is
a
young
lady
to
see
mademoiselle
she
announced
her
open
face
showing
all
her
dislike
of
count
godensky
a
young
lady
who
sends
this
note
begging
that
mademoiselle
will
read
it
at
once
and
consent
to
see
her
thankful
that
the
had
been
interrupted
i
held
out
my
hand
for
the
letter
marianne
gave
it
to
me
i
glanced
at
the
name
written
below
the
lines
which
only
half
filled
the
first
page
of
theatre
paper
and
found
it
strange
to
me
but
even
if
i
had
not
been
ready
to
snatch
at
the
chance
of
ridding
myself
immediately
of
godensky
the
few
words
above
the
unfamiliar
name
would
have
made
me
say
as
i
did
say
bring
the
young
lady
in
at
once
i
come
to
you
from
dundas
on
business
which
he
told
me
was
of
the
greatest
and
most
pressing
importance
diana
forrest
that
was
the
whole
contents
of
the
note
but
a
dozen
sheets
closely
filled
with
arguments
could
not
have
moved
me
more
chapter
xviii
maxine
meets
diana
godensky
was
obliged
to
take
his
leave
which
he
did
abruptly
but
to
all
appearance
with
a
good
grace
and
when
he
was
gone
marianne
ushered
in
a
girl
a
tall
beautiful
girl
in
a
grey
tailor
dress
built
by
an
artist
for
such
time
as
it
might
have
taken
us
to
count
twelve
we
looked
at
each
other
and
as
we
looked
a
little
clock
on
the
mantel
softly
chimed
the
quarter
hour
in
fifteen
minutes
i
should
be
due
upon
the
stage
the
girl
was
very
lovely
yes
lovely
was
the
right
word
for
her
lovely
and
lovable
she
was
like
a
fresh
rose
with
the
morning
dew
of
youth
on
its
petals
a
rose
that
had
budded
and
was
beginning
to
bloom
in
a
fair
garden
far
out
of
reach
of
ugly
weeds
i
envied
her
for
i
felt
how
different
her
sweet
girl
life
had
been
from
my
stormy
if
sometimes
brilliant
career
dundas
sent
you
to
me
i
asked
when
did
you
see
him
surely
not
since
this
afternoon
she
answered
quietly
in
a
pretty
sounding
voice
with
a
soft
little
drawl
of
the
south
in
it
i
went
to
see
him
they
gave
us
five
minutes
a
warder
was
there
but
speaking
quickly
in
spanish
just
a
few
words
he
dundas
managed
to
tell
me
a
thing
he
wished
me
to
do
he
said
it
meant
more
than
his
life
so
i
did
it
for
we
have
been
friends
and
just
now
he
helpless
the
warder
was
angry
and
stopped
our
conversation
at
once
though
the
five
minutes
ended
but
i
understood
dundas
said
there
was
a
moment
to
lose
yet
that
was
in
the
afternoon
and
you
only
come
to
me
at
this
hour
i
exclaimed
i
had
something
else
to
do
first
she
said
in
the
same
quiet
voice
she
was
looking
down
now
not
at
me
and
her
eyelashes
were
so
long
that
they
made
a
shadow
on
her
cheeks
but
the
blood
streamed
over
her
face
even
before
i
saw
dundas
she
went
on
i
had
the
idea
of
calling
on
you
about
a
different
matter
i
think
it
would
be
more
honest
of
me
if
before
i
go
on
i
tell
you
that
quite
by
accident
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
was
with
someone
who
saw
dundas
go
to
your
house
last
night
a
little
after
twelve
i
did
dream
of
spying
on
either
of
you
it
just
happened
it
would
interest
you
to
know
how
yet
i
beg
of
you
to
tell
me
one
thing
was
he
with
you
for
long
so
long
that
he
could
have
got
to
the
other
place
in
time
to
commit
the
murder
he
was
in
my
house
until
after
one
i
said
boldly
but
you
if
you
are
his
friend
ought
to
know
him
well
enough
to
be
certain
without
such
an
assurance
from
me
that
he
is
no
murderer
oh
i
am
certain
she
protested
i
asked
the
question
not
for
that
reason
but
to
know
if
you
could
really
prove
his
innocence
if
you
choose
now
i
find
you
can
when
i
read
the
papers
this
afternoon
at
first
i
wanted
to
rush
off
to
the
police
and
tell
them
where
he
had
been
while
the
murder
was
being
committed
but
i
did
know
how
long
he
had
stopped
in
your
house
and
besides
you
would
have
dared
to
do
that
i
broke
in
the
blood
angry
blood
stinging
my
cheeks
more
hotly
than
it
stung
hers
it
was
a
question
of
daring
she
answered
i
thought
of
him
more
than
of
you
but
i
thought
of
you
too
i
knew
that
if
i
were
in
your
place
no
matter
how
much
harm
i
might
do
to
myself
i
would
confess
that
he
had
been
in
my
house
there
are
reasons
why
i
ca
tell
that
he
was
there
i
said
trying
to
awe
her
by
speaking
coldly
and
proudly
his
visit
was
entirely
on
business
but
dundas
understands
why
i
must
keep
silence
and
he
approves
you
know
he
has
remained
silent
himself
for
your
sake
because
he
is
a
gentleman
brave
and
chivalrous
would
you
take
advantage
of
that
you
take
advantage
of
me
i
flung
back
at
the
girl
looking
her
up
and
down
you
pretend
that
you
came
from
dundas
with
a
pressing
message
for
me
do
you
want
me
to
believe
his
message
i
think
too
well
of
him
i
do
want
you
to
believe
that
she
answered
i
have
come
to
the
message
yet
i
have
earned
a
right
to
speak
to
you
first
on
my
own
account
in
twelve
minutes
i
must
be
on
the
stage
i
said
the
stage
she
echoed
you
can
go
on
acting
just
the
same
though
he
is
in
prison
for
you
i
must
go
on
acting
if
i
did
i
should
do
him
more
harm
than
good
i
wo
keep
you
beyond
your
time
but
i
beg
that
you
do
him
good
if
you
care
for
him
at
all
you
must
want
to
save
him
if
i
care
for
him
i
repeated
in
surprise
you
think
oh
but
i
understand
now
you
are
the
girl
he
spoke
of
she
blushed
deeply
and
then
grew
pale
i
did
not
think
he
would
speak
of
me
she
said
i
wish
he
had
but
if
you
know
everything
the
little
there
is
to
know
you
must
see
that
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
any
rivalry
of
mine
mademoiselle
de
renzie
why
i
exclaimed
you
speak
as
if
you
thought
ivor
dundas
my
lover
i
do
know
what
you
are
to
each
other
she
faltered
all
her
coolness
deserting
her
that
is
my
affair
but
i
say
it
is
you
shall
not
make
such
a
mistake
dundas
cares
nothing
for
me
except
as
a
friend
he
never
did
though
we
flirted
a
little
a
year
ago
to
amuse
ourselves
now
i
am
engaged
to
marry
a
man
whom
i
worship
i
would
gladly
die
for
him
ivor
dundas
knows
that
and
is
glad
but
the
other
man
is
jealous
he
would
understand
he
would
want
to
kill
me
and
himself
and
ivor
dundas
if
he
knew
that
ivor
was
in
my
house
last
night
he
was
there
too
and
i
lied
to
him
about
ivor
how
could
i
expect
him
to
believe
the
real
truth
now
he
is
a
man
but
will
believe
because
you
are
a
woman
like
myself
and
i
think
the
woman
ivor
dundas
loves
her
beautiful
eyes
brightened
he
told
you
that
he
told
me
he
loved
a
girl
and
was
afraid
that
he
would
lose
her
because
of
the
business
which
brought
him
to
me
you
seem
to
have
been
as
unreasonable
with
him
as
ra
as
the
man
i
love
could
be
with
me
poor
ivor
last
night
was
not
the
first
time
that
he
sacrificed
himself
for
chivalry
and
honour
yet
you
blame
me
look
to
yourself
miss
forrest
i
i
do
blame
you
she
stammered
a
sob
in
her
voice
only
i
beg
you
to
save
him
from
gratitude
if
not
from
love
it
true
i
owe
him
a
debt
of
gratitude
deeper
than
you
know
i
answered
he
is
worth
trusting
worth
saving
at
the
expense
of
almost
any
sacrifice
but
i
ca
sacrifice
the
man
i
love
for
him
she
looked
thoughtful
you
say
the
man
you
were
engaged
to
was
at
your
house
while
ivor
was
there
yes
he
came
then
i
hid
ivor
and
i
lied
he
suspected
that
someone
was
with
you
he
stood
watching
outside
your
gate
he
confessed
that
when
i
made
him
repent
his
jealousy
why
do
you
ask
you
saw
him
i
think
so
tell
me
mademoiselle
de
renzie
did
he
lose
anything
of
value
near
your
house
great
heavens
yes
i
cried
what
do
you
know
of
that
i
know
something
enough
maybe
to
help
you
to
find
the
thing
for
him
if
you
will
promise
to
help
ivor
oh
shame
i
cried
violently
sick
of
bargains
and
promises
you
are
trying
to
bribe
me
yes
but
i
am
not
ashamed
the
girl
answered
holding
her
head
high
i
have
not
the
thing
which
was
lost
but
i
can
get
it
for
you
this
very
night
or
morning
if
you
will
do
what
i
ask
i
tell
you
i
can
not
i
said
not
even
to
get
back
that
thing
whose
loss
was
the
beginning
of
all
my
misery
ivor
would
not
wish
me
to
ruin
myself
and
another
dundas
must
be
saved
without
me
please
go
if
we
talked
of
this
together
all
night
it
could
make
no
difference
and
i
in
great
trouble
great
trouble
of
my
own
has
your
trouble
anything
to
do
with
a
document
miss
forrest
slowly
asked
i
started
and
stared
at
her
breathless
it
has
she
answered
for
me
your
face
tells
me
so
has
ivor
message
to
do
with
that
i
almost
gasped
perhaps
but
he
had
no
good
news
of
it
to
give
you
if
you
want
news
if
you
want
the
document
it
must
be
through
me
anything
anything
on
earth
you
like
to
ask
for
the
document
if
you
can
get
it
for
me
i
will
do
i
pleaded
all
my
pride
and
anger
gone
i
ask
you
to
tell
the
police
that
ivor
dundas
was
in
your
house
from
a
little
after
midnight
until
after
one
will
you
do
that
i
must
i
said
if
you
have
the
document
to
sell
and
are
determined
to
sell
it
at
no
other
price
but
if
i
do
what
you
ask
it
will
spoil
my
life
for
it
will
kill
my
lover
love
when
he
knows
i
have
lied
to
him
still
it
will
save
him
from
i
stopped
and
bit
my
lip
will
you
give
me
the
diamonds
too
i
asked
humbly
enough
now
the
diamonds
she
looked
bewildered
the
diamonds
in
the
brocade
bag
oh
surely
they
still
in
the
bag
yes
they
are
they
will
be
in
the
bag
the
girl
answered
her
charming
mouth
suddenly
resolute
though
her
eyes
were
troubled
you
shall
have
the
diamonds
and
the
document
too
for
that
one
promise
how
is
it
possible
that
you
can
give
me
the
document
i
asked
half
suspicious
for
that
it
should
come
to
me
after
all
i
had
endured
because
of
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
that
it
should
come
through
this
girl
seemed
incredible
ivor
sent
me
to
find
it
and
i
found
it
she
said
simply
that
was
why
i
could
come
to
you
before
i
had
to
get
the
document
i
quite
know
how
i
was
to
do
it
at
first
because
i
had
no
one
to
help
or
advise
me
and
ivor
said
it
was
under
some
in
a
box
on
the
balcony
of
the
room
where
the
man
was
murdered
i
was
sure
i
would
be
allowed
to
get
into
the
room
itself
so
it
seemed
difficult
but
i
thought
it
all
out
and
hired
a
room
for
the
evening
in
a
house
next
door
pretending
i
was
a
new
york
journalist
i
had
to
wait
until
after
dark
and
then
i
climbed
across
from
one
balcony
to
the
other
it
as
easy
to
do
as
it
looked
from
the
photograph
i
saw
because
it
was
so
high
up
and
the
balconies
were
quite
far
apart
after
all
but
i
could
fail
ivor
and
i
got
across
the
rest
was
nothing
except
the
climbing
back
i
do
know
how
the
document
came
in
the
box
though
i
suppose
ivor
put
it
there
to
hide
it
from
the
police
it
was
wrapped
up
in
a
towel
and
it
quite
clean
i
think
i
said
slowly
when
she
had
finished
her
story
that
you
have
a
right
to
set
a
high
price
on
that
document
you
are
a
brave
girl
it
not
much
to
be
brave
for
a
man
you
love
is
it
and
now
i
going
to
give
the
thing
to
you
because
i
trust
you
mademoiselle
de
renzie
i
know
you
pay
and
i
hope
oh
i
it
wo
hurt
you
as
you
think
it
will
then
as
if
it
had
been
some
ordinary
paper
she
whipped
from
a
long
pocket
of
a
coat
she
wore
the
treaty
she
put
it
into
my
hand
i
felt
it
i
clasped
it
i
could
have
kissed
it
the
very
touch
of
it
made
me
tremble
do
you
know
what
this
is
miss
forrest
i
asked
no
she
said
it
was
yours
or
ivor
of
course
i
did
look
and
then
there
came
the
rap
rap
of
the
at
the
door
the
fifteen
minutes
were
over
but
i
had
the
treaty
and
i
had
to
pay
its
price
chapter
xix
maxine
plays
the
last
hand
of
the
game
when
the
play
was
over
i
let
raoul
drive
home
with
me
to
supper
if
godensky
knew
as
he
may
have
known
since
he
seemed
to
know
all
my
movements
perhaps
he
thought
that
i
was
seeing
raoul
for
the
last
time
and
sending
him
away
from
me
for
ever
but
though
the
game
was
not
in
my
hands
yet
the
treaty
was
and
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
defy
godensky
i
had
almost
promised
that
if
he
held
his
hand
i
would
give
raoul
up
and
never
have
i
broken
my
word
but
if
i
wrote
a
letter
to
godensky
in
the
morning
saying
i
had
changed
my
mind
that
he
could
do
his
worst
against
raoul
du
laurier
and
against
me
for
nothing
should
part
us
two
except
death
then
he
would
have
fair
warning
that
i
did
not
intend
to
do
the
thing
to
which
he
had
nearly
forced
me
and
i
would
fight
him
when
he
tried
to
take
revenge
but
meanwhile
before
he
got
that
letter
i
would
i
must
find
some
way
of
putting
the
treaty
back
in
its
place
at
the
foreign
office
it
was
too
soon
to
dare
to
be
happy
yet
for
it
was
on
the
cards
that
even
when
i
had
saved
raoul
from
the
consequences
of
my
political
treachery
godensky
might
still
be
able
to
ruin
me
with
him
yet
the
relief
i
felt
after
the
all
but
hopeless
anguish
in
which
i
had
been
drowning
for
the
last
few
days
gave
to
my
spirit
a
wild
exhilaration
that
night
i
encouraged
raoul
with
hints
that
i
had
news
of
the
necklace
and
said
that
if
he
would
let
me
come
to
him
in
his
office
as
soon
as
it
was
open
in
the
morning
i
might
be
able
to
surprise
him
pleasantly
of
course
he
answered
that
it
would
give
him
the
greatest
joy
to
see
me
there
or
anywhere
and
we
parted
with
an
appointment
for
nine
next
day
when
he
had
gone
i
wrote
a
note
a
very
short
note
to
count
godensky
i
wanted
to
have
it
ready
but
i
did
not
mean
to
send
it
till
the
treaty
was
in
the
safe
whence
i
had
taken
it
then
the
letter
should
go
at
once
by
messenger
and
it
would
still
be
very
early
in
the
day
i
hoped
usually
i
have
my
cup
of
chocolate
in
bed
at
nine
but
on
the
morning
which
followed
i
was
dressed
and
ready
to
go
out
at
half
past
eight
i
think
that
i
had
not
slept
at
all
but
that
did
matter
i
felt
strong
and
fresh
and
my
heart
was
full
of
courage
i
was
leaving
nothing
to
chance
i
had
a
plan
and
knew
how
i
meant
to
play
the
last
hand
in
the
game
it
might
go
against
me
but
i
held
a
high
trump
again
as
before
raoul
received
me
alone
dearest
he
exclaimed
i
know
your
news
must
be
good
for
you
look
so
bright
and
beautiful
tell
me
tell
me
i
laughed
teasingly
though
heaven
knew
i
was
in
no
mood
for
teasing
you
too
impatient
i
said
to
punish
you
for
asking
about
the
wretched
diamonds
before
you
enquired
how
i
slept
and
whether
i
dreamed
of
you
i
shall
make
you
pay
a
penalty
any
penalty
you
will
he
answered
laughing
too
and
entering
into
the
joke
for
he
was
happy
and
hopeful
now
seeing
that
i
could
joke
let
me
sit
down
and
write
at
your
desk
on
a
bit
of
your
paper
i
said
he
gave
me
pen
and
ink
i
scribbled
off
a
few
words
and
folded
the
note
into
an
envelope
now
this
is
very
precious
i
went
on
it
tells
you
all
you
want
to
know
but
i
going
to
post
it
no
no
he
protested
i
ca
wait
for
the
post
oh
i
would
trust
my
treasure
to
the
post
office
not
even
if
it
were
insured
open
that
wonderful
safe
you
gave
me
a
peep
into
the
other
day
and
i
put
this
valuable
document
in
among
the
others
not
more
valuable
to
the
country
than
this
ought
to
be
to
you
i
hide
it
there
and
you
must
shut
up
the
safe
without
looking
for
it
till
gone
then
you
must
count
ten
and
after
that
you
may
search
remember
you
said
you
submit
to
any
penalty
so
no
excuses
no
complaints
raoul
laughed
you
shall
have
your
way
fantastic
though
it
be
for
you
are
a
sorceress
and
have
bewitched
me
he
unlocked
the
door
of
the
safe
and
stood
waiting
for
me
to
gratify
my
whim
but
i
gaily
motioned
him
behind
me
if
you
stand
there
you
can
see
where
i
put
it
and
that
wo
be
fair
play
turn
your
back
he
obeyed
you
see
how
i
trust
you
he
said
there
lie
my
secrets
they
safe
from
me
i
said
pertly
and
so
indeed
they
were
now
they
too
uninteresting
to
amuse
me
in
the
least
as
i
spoke
i
found
and
abstracted
the
dummy
treaty
and
slipped
the
real
one
into
its
place
then
i
laid
the
envelope
with
the
note
i
had
written
where
he
could
not
help
finding
it
at
first
or
second
glance
now
you
can
close
the
safe
i
said
he
shut
the
door
and
i
almost
breathed
aloud
the
words
that
burst
from
my
heart
thank
heaven
i
must
leave
you
i
told
him
and
i
was
kind
for
a
moment
capricious
no
longer
because
though
the
treaty
had
been
restored
i
was
going
to
open
the
cage
of
godensky
vengeance
and
i
was
afraid
of
him
i
may
come
to
you
as
soon
as
i
free
raoul
asked
yes
come
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
the
news
and
what
you
think
of
me
i
said
and
while
i
spoke
smiling
i
prayed
within
that
he
might
continue
to
think
of
me
all
things
good
far
better
than
i
deserved
yet
not
better
than
i
would
try
to
deserve
in
the
future
if
i
were
permitted
to
spend
that
future
with
him
the
next
thing
i
did
was
to
send
my
letter
to
count
godensky
this
was
a
flinging
down
of
the
glove
and
i
knew
it
well
but
i
was
ready
to
fight
now
then
i
had
to
keep
my
promise
to
miss
forrest
but
i
had
thought
of
a
way
in
which
i
hoped
that
promise
fulfilled
as
i
meant
to
fulfil
it
might
help
rather
than
injure
me
i
had
not
lain
awake
all
night
for
nothing
i
went
to
the
office
of
the
chief
of
police
who
is
a
gentleman
and
a
patron
of
the
theatre
when
he
can
spare
time
from
his
work
i
had
met
him
and
had
reason
to
know
that
he
admired
my
acting
his
first
words
were
of
congratulation
upon
my
success
in
the
new
play
and
he
was
as
cordial
as
complimentary
as
if
he
had
never
heard
of
that
scene
at
the
élysée
palace
hotel
about
which
of
course
he
knew
everything
so
far
as
his
subordinate
could
report
are
you
surprised
to
see
me
monsieur
i
asked
a
great
delight
is
always
more
or
less
of
a
surprise
in
this
world
he
gallantly
replied
but
you
can
guess
what
has
brought
me
would
that
i
could
think
it
was
only
to
give
me
a
box
at
the
theatre
this
evening
it
is
partly
that
i
laughed
partly
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
of
course
and
partly
you
know
already
since
you
know
everything
that
i
am
a
friend
of
dundas
the
young
englishman
accused
of
a
murder
which
he
could
not
possibly
have
committed
could
not
possibly
have
committed
is
that
merely
your
opinion
as
a
loyal
friend
or
have
you
come
to
make
a
communication
to
me
for
that
and
to
offer
you
the
for
a
thousand
thanks
for
the
box
as
for
the
communication
it
this
dundas
was
in
my
house
at
the
time
when
according
to
the
doctors
statements
the
murder
must
have
been
committed
oh
it
a
hard
thing
for
me
to
come
and
tell
you
this
i
went
on
hastily
not
that
i
ashamed
to
have
received
a
call
from
him
at
that
hour
as
it
was
necessary
to
see
him
then
or
not
at
all
he
meant
to
leave
paris
early
in
the
morning
but
because
i
engaged
to
be
married
to
perhaps
you
know
that
though
among
other
things
i
heard
a
rumour
i
did
know
that
it
amounted
to
an
engagement
monsieur
du
laurier
is
to
be
a
thousand
times
congratulated
i
love
him
dearly
i
said
simply
and
not
because
i
am
an
actress
but
because
i
am
a
a
woman
and
had
suffered
all
that
i
could
bear
tears
rose
to
my
eyes
i
am
true
to
him
and
always
have
been
but
he
is
horribly
jealous
i
ca
explain
dundas
night
visit
in
a
way
to
satisfy
him
if
raoul
finds
out
that
an
englishman
but
of
whom
i
never
spoke
was
at
my
house
after
midnight
he
will
believe
i
have
deceived
him
oh
monsieur
if
you
would
help
me
to
keep
this
secret
i
am
telling
you
so
frankly
keep
the
secret
yet
use
it
to
free
the
englishman
asked
the
chief
of
police
gravely
yes
i
ask
no
less
of
you
i
beg
i
implore
you
it
would
kill
me
to
break
with
raoul
du
laurier
dear
mademoiselle
said
the
good
and
gallant
man
trust
me
to
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
i
could
see
that
my
tears
had
moved
him
a
grief
to
you
would
be
a
blow
to
paris
yet
well
as
you
have
been
frank
i
owe
it
to
you
to
be
equally
so
on
my
side
i
should
before
this
have
sent
quite
privately
and
in
a
friendly
way
to
question
you
about
this
dundas
who
passed
under
another
name
at
the
hotel
where
you
called
upon
him
but
i
received
a
request
from
a
very
high
quarter
to
wait
before
communicating
with
you
now
as
you
have
come
to
me
i
suppose
i
may
speak
ask
me
any
questions
you
choose
i
said
and
i
answer
them
then
to
begin
with
since
you
are
engaged
to
monsieur
du
laurier
how
do
you
explain
the
statement
you
made
at
the
hotel
concerning
mr
dundas
that
is
one
of
the
many
things
i
have
come
here
on
purpose
to
tell
you
i
answered
him
for
i
am
going
to
give
you
my
whole
confidence
i
throw
myself
upon
your
mercy
you
do
me
a
great
honour
will
you
speak
without
my
prompting
yes
i
would
prefer
it
in
england
a
year
ago
i
had
a
little
flirtation
with
dundas
no
more
though
we
liked
and
admired
each
other
we
exchanged
a
few
silly
letters
and
i
forgot
all
about
them
until
i
fell
in
love
with
raoul
and
promised
to
marry
him
only
a
short
time
ago
then
i
could
bear
to
think
that
i
had
written
these
foolish
letters
and
that
perhaps
dundas
might
have
kept
them
i
wrote
and
asked
if
he
had
he
answered
that
he
had
every
one
and
valued
them
immensely
but
if
i
wished
he
would
either
burn
all
or
bring
them
to
me
whichever
i
chose
i
chose
to
have
him
bring
them
and
i
told
him
that
i
meet
him
at
the
élysée
palace
hotel
on
a
certain
evening
to
receive
the
letters
from
him
he
came
as
i
said
under
another
name
why
was
that
mademoiselle
since
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
be
ashamed
of
he
also
is
in
love
and
just
engaged
to
be
married
to
an
american
girl
who
lives
with
relations
in
london
in
a
very
high
position
he
want
the
girl
to
know
he
was
coming
to
paris
because
it
seems
there
had
been
a
little
talk
about
him
and
me
which
she
had
heard
and
she
did
like
it
i
see
this
gentleman
started
for
paris
i
have
learned
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
the
day
after
a
ball
at
a
house
where
he
met
the
british
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
perhaps
for
i
have
enquired
and
found
out
that
the
girl
a
miss
forrest
is
distantly
connected
with
the
british
foreign
secretary
she
lives
with
her
aunt
lady
mountstuart
whose
sister
is
married
to
that
gentleman
and
the
foreign
secretary
is
a
cousin
of
lord
mountstuart
ah
miss
forrest
you
know
of
her
already
i
have
heard
her
name
i
guessed
how
for
she
could
not
have
seen
ivor
dundas
in
prison
except
through
the
chief
of
police
but
i
said
nothing
of
that
you
say
you
know
how
we
met
at
the
hotel
dundas
and
i
i
went
on
but
i
explain
to
you
now
the
inner
meaning
of
it
all
which
even
you
ca
have
found
out
dundas
was
to
have
brought
me
my
letters
half
a
dozen
he
gave
me
a
leather
case
which
he
took
from
an
inner
breast
pocket
saying
the
letters
were
in
it
but
the
room
was
dark
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
electricity
and
i
had
let
him
push
back
the
curtains
for
fear
i
might
be
seen
from
outside
if
the
lights
should
suddenly
come
on
he
did
see
the
case
as
he
handed
it
to
me
nor
could
i
just
at
that
instant
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
quick
as
thought
i
pushed
the
leather
case
down
between
the
seat
and
back
of
the
sofa
but
what
reason
had
you
to
suppose
that
any
danger
of
discovery
threatened
you
because
of
a
knock
at
the
door
i
tell
you
there
is
a
man
i
wo
mention
his
name
but
you
know
it
very
well
and
maybe
it
is
in
your
mind
now
who
wants
me
to
marry
him
he
has
wanted
it
for
some
time
i
think
because
he
admires
women
who
are
before
the
public
and
applauded
by
the
world
also
perhaps
because
i
have
refused
him
and
he
is
one
who
wants
most
what
he
finds
hardest
to
get
he
is
not
a
scrupulous
person
but
he
has
some
power
and
a
good
deal
of
influence
because
he
is
very
highly
connected
and
when
people
have
to
grind
he
helps
to
grind
them
he
has
suspected
for
some
time
that
i
cared
for
du
laurier
and
for
that
he
has
hated
raoul
i
have
fancied
that
he
hired
detectives
to
spy
upon
me
and
my
instinct
as
well
as
common
sense
told
me
that
he
would
let
no
chance
slip
to
separate
me
from
the
man
i
love
he
would
work
mischief
between
us
or
he
would
try
to
ruin
raoul
or
crush
me
anything
to
keep
us
apart
when
i
saw
the
commissary
of
police
i
was
hardly
surprised
and
though
i
did
know
what
pretext
had
brought
him
i
said
to
myself
is
the
work
of
perhaps
better
not
mention
the
name
mademoiselle
i
did
mean
to
i
leave
that
to
your
imagination
is
the
work
of
the
man
whose
love
is
more
cruel
than
hate
i
thought
while
i
wondered
what
possible
use
the
police
could
make
of
my
letters
i
was
shaking
with
terror
lest
they
should
come
upon
them
and
they
should
somehow
fall
into
a
certain
man
hands
then
at
last
they
did
find
the
case
just
as
i
begun
to
hope
it
was
safe
i
begged
the
commissary
of
police
not
to
open
it
in
vain
when
he
did
what
was
my
relief
to
see
the
diamond
necklace
you
must
have
heard
of
my
relief
and
my
surprise
and
now
i
going
to
confide
in
you
the
secret
of
another
speaking
to
you
as
my
friend
and
a
man
of
honour
those
jewels
had
been
stolen
only
a
few
days
ago
from
monsieur
du
laurier
and
he
was
in
despair
at
their
loss
for
they
belonged
to
a
dear
friend
of
his
an
inveterate
gambler
but
an
adorable
woman
she
dared
not
tell
her
husband
of
money
that
she
lost
but
begged
raoul
to
sell
the
diamonds
for
her
in
amsterdam
and
have
them
replaced
by
paste
on
his
way
there
the
necklace
was
stolen
by
an
expert
thief
who
must
somehow
have
learned
what
was
going
on
through
the
pawnbroker
with
whom
the
jewels
had
been
in
pledge
for
a
few
thousand
francs
only
you
can
imagine
my
astonishment
at
seeing
the
necklace
returned
in
such
a
miraculous
way
i
thought
that
ivor
dundas
must
have
got
it
back
meaning
to
give
it
to
me
as
a
surprise
and
the
letters
afterwards
and
it
was
only
to
keep
the
letters
out
of
the
affair
altogether
at
any
price
evidences
in
black
and
white
of
my
silly
flirtation
and
also
to
avoid
any
association
of
raoul
name
with
the
necklace
that
i
told
the
commissary
of
police
the
leather
case
had
in
it
a
present
from
my
lover
i
spoke
impulsively
in
sheer
desperation
and
the
instant
the
words
were
out
i
would
have
cut
off
my
hand
to
take
back
the
stupid
falsehood
but
what
good
to
deny
what
i
had
just
said
the
men
would
have
believed
me
when
the
police
had
gone
i
asked
dundas
for
my
letters
but
he
thought
he
had
given
them
to
me
and
he
knew
no
more
of
the
diamonds
in
their
red
case
than
i
did
far
less
indeed
i
was
distracted
to
find
that
my
letters
had
disappeared
though
i
was
thankful
for
raoul
sake
to
have
the
necklace
dundas
believed
that
his
own
leather
case
with
the
letters
must
have
been
stolen
from
his
pocket
in
the
train
though
he
could
imagine
why
the
diamonds
had
been
given
to
him
instead
but
he
suspected
a
travelling
companion
of
his
who
had
acted
queerly
and
he
determined
to
try
and
find
the
man
he
was
to
bring
me
news
after
the
theatre
at
my
house
about
midnight
he
came
fifteen
minutes
later
having
been
detained
at
his
hotel
friends
of
his
had
unexpectedly
arrived
he
had
just
time
to
tell
me
this
and
that
after
going
out
on
a
false
scent
he
had
employed
a
detective
named
girard
when
monsieur
du
laurier
arrived
unexpectedly
it
seems
he
been
made
frantically
jealous
by
some
misrepresentations
of
the
man
whose
name
we
have
mentioned
i
begged
dundas
to
hide
in
my
boudoir
which
he
disliked
doing
but
finally
did
to
please
me
i
hoped
that
he
would
escape
by
the
window
but
it
stuck
and
to
my
horror
i
heard
him
there
in
the
dark
moving
about
i
covered
the
sounds
as
well
as
i
could
and
pacified
raoul
who
thought
he
had
seen
someone
come
in
i
hinted
that
it
must
have
been
the
fiancé
of
a
pretty
housemaid
i
have
it
was
not
till
after
one
that
ivor
dundas
finally
got
away
this
i
swear
to
you
what
happened
to
him
after
leaving
my
house
you
know
better
than
i
do
for
i
have
seen
him
since
as
you
are
well
aware
he
says
he
found
a
letter
from
the
thief
in
his
pocket
and
went
to
the
address
named
that
he
could
get
a
cab
and
walked
but
you
have
read
the
papers
yes
and
i
know
how
loyal
he
has
been
to
me
why
he
would
even
tell
about
the
diamonds
much
less
my
letters
as
for
these
letters
you
are
still
anxious
about
them
mademoiselle
my
hope
is
that
dundas
found
and
had
time
to
destroy
them
rather
than
risk
further
delay
you
would
like
to
know
their
fate
i
would
indeed
well
i
applaud
the
englishman
chivalry
vive
cordiale
you
are
a
man
to
understand
such
chivalry
monsieur
now
that
humbled
myself
ca
you
give
me
hope
that
he
soon
be
released
and
yet
that
that
i
sha
be
made
to
suffer
for
my
confession
to
you
clear
to
you
is
it
that
the
murder
must
have
been
done
long
before
he
could
have
reached
the
house
in
the
rue
de
la
fille
sauvage
from
the
rue
yes
that
is
clear
and
needless
to
say
i
believe
your
statement
mademoiselle
you
are
brave
and
good
to
have
come
forward
as
you
have
without
being
called
upon
there
are
still
some
formalities
to
be
gone
through
before
dundas
can
be
released
but
english
influence
is
at
work
in
high
quarters
and
after
what
you
have
told
me
i
think
he
will
not
much
longer
be
under
restraint
besides
i
may
as
well
inform
you
dear
lady
that
not
ten
minutes
before
you
arrived
this
morning
i
received
satisfactory
news
of
the
arrest
of
two
englishmen
at
frankfort
who
seem
to
have
been
concerned
in
this
business
in
the
rue
de
la
fille
sauvage
they
certainly
travelled
with
the
murdered
man
and
a
friend
of
his
called
gestre
just
back
from
marseilles
has
sworn
that
these
persons
were
formerly
partners
of
janson
the
deceased
if
janson
stole
the
necklace
from
monsieur
du
laurier
with
this
pair
as
accomplices
and
then
tried
to
cheat
them
a
motive
for
the
crime
is
evident
and
we
are
getting
at
janson
record
which
seems
to
be
a
bad
one
a
notorious
one
throughout
europe
if
he
proves
to
be
the
man
we
think
i
hope
really
that
in
a
very
few
days
dundas
may
be
able
to
thank
you
in
person
for
what
you
done
for
him
and
to
tell
you
what
has
become
of
those
letters
what
good
will
their
destruction
do
me
though
if
you
are
not
merciful
i
intend
to
be
for
i
can
combine
mercy
with
justice
dear
mademoiselle
monsieur
du
laurier
need
never
know
the
circumstances
you
have
told
to
me
or
that
the
englishman
alibi
has
been
proved
by
you
the
arrest
of
these
two
men
in
frankfort
will
i
feel
sure
help
the
police
to
keep
your
secret
as
you
would
keep
it
yourself
now
will
that
assurance
make
it
easier
for
you
to
put
your
whole
soul
into
your
part
if
you
will
accept
that
box
i
said
letting
him
kiss
my
hand
and
feeling
inclined
to
kiss
his
then
i
drove
home
with
my
heart
singing
for
i
felt
almost
sure
that
i
had
trumped
godensky
last
trick
now
when
i
reached
home
miss
forrest
was
there
she
had
brought
the
diamonds
in
the
brocade
bag
oddly
enough
the
ribbons
which
fastened
it
were
torn
out
as
if
there
had
been
a
struggle
for
the
possession
of
the
bag
but
miss
forrest
did
not
explain
this
or
even
allude
to
it
at
all
i
thanked
her
for
coming
and
for
bringing
the
jewels
i
have
kept
my
promise
i
said
the
man
you
love
will
be
free
in
a
few
days
will
you
let
me
say
that
i
think
you
are
a
very
noble
pair
and
i
hope
you
will
be
happy
together
i
shall
try
to
make
up
to
him
for
my
hateful
suspicions
and
everything
she
said
like
a
repentant
child
i
love
him
so
much
and
he
you
you
almost
broke
his
heart
by
throwing
him
over
i
saw
that
but
how
gloriously
you
will
mend
it
again
oh
i
hope
so
she
cried
and
you
have
i
really
spoiled
your
life
by
forcing
you
to
make
that
promise
i
pray
that
i
have
i
thought
you
had
but
i
was
mistaken
i
answered
the
thing
you
have
made
me
do
has
proved
a
blessing
i
may
have
altered
some
of
the
facts
a
little
but
none
of
those
that
concern
dundas
and
a
woman
has
to
use
such
weapons
as
she
has
against
cruel
enemies
i
hope
you
defeat
yours
said
miss
forrest
i
begin
to
believe
i
shall
said
i
and
we
shook
hands
she
is
the
only
girl
i
ever
saw
who
seemed
to
me
worthy
of
ivor
dundas
early
in
the
afternoon
raoul
came
and
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
give
him
the
diamonds
you
are
my
good
angel
he
exclaimed
thank
heaven
i
wo
have
to
take
your
money
now
all
that
mine
is
yours
i
said
it
is
i
want
for
mine
he
answered
when
am
i
to
have
you
do
keep
me
waiting
long
my
darling
i
nothing
without
you
i
do
want
to
keep
you
waiting
i
told
him
and
indeed
i
longed
to
be
his
wife
his
in
spite
of
godensky
his
till
death
us
should
part
he
took
me
in
his
arms
and
then
when
i
had
promised
to
marry
him
as
soon
as
a
marriage
could
be
arranged
our
talk
drifted
back
to
the
morning
and
the
note
i
had
written
telling
him
that
a
pretty
american
girl
had
found
the
diamonds
she
engaged
to
marry
ivor
dundas
an
old
friend
of
mine
the
poor
fellow
so
stupidly
accused
of
murder
i
explained
but
of
course
he
is
innocent
of
course
he
be
discharged
without
a
blot
upon
his
name
they
tremendously
in
love
with
each
other
almost
as
much
as
you
and
i
you
did
tell
me
about
the
love
affair
in
your
note
said
raoul
you
spoke
only
of
the
girl
and
the
coincidence
of
her
driving
past
your
house
after
i
went
in
there
was
time
for
more
in
that
famous
communication
i
laughed
raoul
echoed
me
it
came
rather
too
near
being
famous
by
the
way
he
said
just
after
i
had
found
it
in
the
safe
where
you
would
put
it
you
witch
a
man
came
in
with
an
order
from
the
president
to
copy
a
clause
in
a
new
treaty
which
is
kept
there
what
treaty
i
asked
with
a
leap
of
the
heart
oh
one
between
france
japan
and
russia
but
that
is
the
point
ah
it
not
if
he
had
known
the
thing
is
it
would
have
been
rather
awkward
would
it
if
i
had
got
your
note
out
of
the
safe
before
the
man
came
in
as
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
me
or
out
of
the
open
safe
for
a
second
thank
god
i
was
too
late
i
stammered
before
i
could
keep
back
the
rushing
words
you
mean
thank
god
he
was
sooner
do
you
darling
amended
raoul
yes
of
course
how
stupid
i
am
i
murmured
all
along
then
godensky
had
meant
to
get
my
promise
and
deceive
me
for
i
had
not
even
sent
my
note
of
defiance
when
this
trick
was
played
had
the
treaty
been
missing
and
raoul
disgraced
godensky
would
no
doubt
have
vowed
to
me
if
i
lived
to
hear
his
vows
that
he
had
had
no
hand
in
the
discovery
fear
of
the
terrible
man
who
had
so
nearly
beaten
me
in
the
game
made
me
quiver
even
now
you
see
i
went
on
i
can
think
of
nothing
but
you
and
my
love
for
you
you
never
be
jealous
and
make
me
miserable
again
will
you
no
matter
what
count
godensky
or
any
other
wretched
creature
may
say
of
me
to
you
i
listened
to
godensky
for
the
last
time
said
raoul
the
dog
he
shall
never
come
near
me
again
i
hardly
think
he
will
try
i
said
i
glad
we
going
to
be
married
soon
do
you
know
i
half
inclined
to
do
as
you
asked
me
sometimes
and
promised
you
would
ask
again
leave
the
stage
i
want
to
rest
and
just
be
happy
like
other
women
i
want
love
and
peace
and
you
you
shall
have
all
and
for
always
answered
raoul
if
only
i
deserved
you
if
only
i
deserved
you
i
echoed
raoul
would
not
let
me
say
that
but
he
did
not
know
and
i
trust
that
he
never
may
or
not
until
a
time
if
such
a
time
could
come
that
he
would
forgive
me
all
things
because
we
are
one
in
a
perfect
love
the
end
