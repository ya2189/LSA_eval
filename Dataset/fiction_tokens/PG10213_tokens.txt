the
everlasting
whisper
tale
of
the
california
by
jackson
gregory
to
maxwell
perkins
with
the
author
grateful
recognition
of
his
countless
sympathetic
criticisms
and
suggestions
it
was
springtime
in
the
california
sierra
never
were
skies
bluer
never
did
the
golden
steep
the
endless
forest
lands
in
richer
glory
ridge
after
ridge
the
mountains
swept
on
and
fell
away
upon
one
side
until
in
the
vague
distances
they
sank
to
the
monotonous
level
of
the
sacramento
valley
down
there
it
was
already
summer
and
fields
were
hot
and
brown
ridge
after
ridge
the
mountains
stretched
on
the
other
side
rising
steadily
growing
ever
more
august
and
mighty
and
rocky
on
their
crests
across
the
blue
gorges
the
snow
was
dazzling
white
and
winter
held
stubbornly
on
at
altitudes
of
seven
thousand
feet
thus
winter
springtime
and
ripe
summer
coexisted
touching
fingers
across
the
seventy
miles
that
lie
between
the
icy
top
of
the
sierra
and
the
burning
lowlands
here
in
a
region
lifted
a
mile
into
the
rare
atmosphere
was
a
ridge
all
naked
boulder
and
spire
along
its
crest
its
sides
studded
with
pine
and
incense
cedar
the
afternoon
sunlight
streaked
the
big
bronze
tree
trunks
making
bright
gay
spots
and
patches
of
light
casting
cool
black
shadows
across
the
open
spaces
where
the
brown
dead
needles
lay
in
thick
carpets
it
was
early
june
and
thus
far
only
had
the
springtime
advanced
in
its
vernal
progress
upward
through
the
timbered
solitudes
some
few
small
patches
of
snow
still
lingered
on
in
spots
sheltered
from
the
sun
but
now
they
were
ebbing
away
in
thin
trickles
down
in
a
hollow
at
the
base
of
the
sunny
slope
was
a
round
alpine
lake
no
bigger
than
a
pond
in
a
city
park
it
was
of
the
same
deep
perfect
blue
as
the
sky
whose
colour
it
seemed
not
to
reflect
but
to
absorb
a
tiny
fragment
of
this
same
heavenly
azure
drifted
downward
among
the
trees
like
a
bit
of
sky
falling
a
second
bit
of
blue
that
had
skimmed
across
the
lake
and
was
visible
now
only
as
it
rose
and
winged
across
the
contrasting
coloured
meadow
rimming
the
pool
was
like
a
bit
of
the
lake
itself
two
bluebirds
they
swerved
before
the
meeting
their
wings
fluttered
they
lighted
on
branches
of
the
same
tree
and
shyly
eyed
each
other
did
a
man
need
to
have
the
still
message
of
all
the
woods
summed
up
in
final
emphasis
this
it
was
spring
is
here
the
man
himself
as
the
birds
had
done
before
him
had
the
appearance
of
materializing
spontaneously
from
some
distilled
essence
of
his
environment
a
moment
ago
the
spaces
between
the
were
empty
yet
he
had
been
there
a
long
time
it
was
only
because
he
had
moved
that
he
attracted
attention
even
of
the
forest
folk
who
were
returning
to
tree
and
thicket
as
the
bluebirds
had
been
viewless
when
merged
into
the
backgrounds
of
their
own
colour
so
he
while
sitting
with
his
back
against
a
tawny
cedar
had
been
drawn
into
the
entity
of
the
wilderness
to
which
obviously
he
belonged
here
he
blended
harmonized
disappeared
when
he
held
motionless
the
tall
laced
boots
were
of
brown
leather
much
scuffed
one
in
colour
with
the
soil
dusting
them
the
khaki
trousers
gathered
into
the
the
soft
flannel
shirt
were
the
brown
of
the
tree
trunks
skin
of
hands
and
face
and
muscular
throat
were
the
bronze
of
ripe
and
burnished
and
in
a
landscape
spotted
with
light
and
shadow
the
head
of
black
hair
might
have
passed
for
a
bit
of
such
shadow
as
a
tuft
of
thick
foliage
casts
upon
the
ground
beyond
this
outward
harmony
there
was
something
at
once
more
intangible
and
yet
more
vital
and
positive
that
made
the
man
a
piece
with
the
natural
world
about
him
perhaps
it
was
that
he
had
lived
so
many
months
of
so
many
years
in
the
open
that
he
had
grown
to
be
true
brother
of
the
wild
that
he
had
shed
coat
after
coat
of
artificial
veneer
as
he
took
on
the
layers
of
tan
that
in
doing
so
he
shed
from
his
mind
many
of
the
artificialities
of
the
twentieth
century
and
remembered
ancient
instincts
his
deep
chest
knew
the
tricks
of
proper
breathing
he
would
come
to
the
top
of
a
steep
climb
with
unlaboured
breath
he
stood
tall
and
stalwart
filled
with
vigorous
strength
in
repose
like
the
straight
valiant
cedars
his
eyes
were
black
and
piercing
as
keen
as
those
of
the
hawk
which
circling
in
the
deeper
sky
had
seen
him
when
he
moved
he
too
had
seen
the
hawk
all
about
him
was
a
lustily
masculine
phase
of
the
world
giant
trees
dominating
giant
slopes
rugged
boulders
upheaved
iron
cliffs
defying
time
and
battling
the
years
he
like
them
was
virile
his
sex
clothing
him
magnificently
he
had
not
shaved
for
three
days
and
yet
instead
of
looking
untidy
was
but
clothed
in
the
greater
vitality
while
his
eyes
sped
swiftly
hither
and
thither
now
busied
with
wide
groupings
now
catching
small
details
his
face
was
impassive
in
keeping
both
with
his
own
magnificent
physique
and
the
rugged
note
of
the
forest
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
who
had
defied
and
battled
beyond
the
lake
a
peak
upthrust
its
rocky
front
into
the
sky
it
frowned
across
the
ridges
darkened
by
the
shadows
which
its
own
irregularities
cast
athwart
its
massive
features
but
the
sun
slowly
as
it
rolled
sought
out
those
shadows
they
moved
crept
to
other
and
the
golden
light
coaxed
a
subdued
soft
gentleness
across
the
massive
boulders
this
too
the
man
saw
he
stood
looking
out
across
the
ridges
and
so
to
the
final
bulwark
against
the
sky
still
white
with
last
december
he
sought
landmarks
and
measured
distance
not
in
miles
but
in
hours
then
he
glanced
briefly
at
the
sun
but
now
before
starting
on
again
he
turned
from
the
more
distant
landscape
and
remembering
the
immediate
scene
about
him
as
he
had
viewed
it
last
drowsing
in
the
indian
summer
of
last
october
he
noted
everywhere
the
handiwork
of
young
june
the
eyes
which
had
been
keen
and
alert
filled
suddenly
with
a
shining
brightness
the
springtime
eternally
youthful
coquette
had
come
with
a
great
outward
display
of
timidity
and
shyness
into
the
sternly
solemn
forest
land
of
the
high
sierra
to
the
last
fine
detail
and
exquisite
touch
was
she
more
here
than
elsewhere
softly
prettily
daintily
feminine
her
light
heart
idly
set
on
wooing
from
its
calm
and
abstracted
aloofness
this
region
of
granite
and
lava
of
rugged
chasms
and
august
ancient
trees
she
filled
the
air
with
fragrances
lightly
shaken
she
scattered
bright
fragile
flowers
to
brighten
the
earth
and
clear
to
sparkle
through
the
air
hesitant
always
in
the
seeming
she
came
with
that
shy
step
of
hers
to
the
feet
of
glooming
precipices
under
crests
where
the
snow
clung
on
she
played
at
indifference
loitering
with
a
new
flower
knowing
that
little
by
little
the
thaw
would
answer
her
veiled
efforts
that
in
the
end
the
monarch
of
all
the
brooding
mountain
tops
would
discard
the
white
mantle
of
aloofness
and
thrill
to
her
embrace
knowing
too
that
with
each
successive
conquest
made
secure
she
would
only
laugh
in
that
singing
voice
of
hers
and
turn
her
back
and
pass
on
on
and
on
over
ridges
and
ranges
and
so
around
the
world
the
woods
lay
steeped
in
sunshine
enwrapped
in
characteristic
quietude
there
was
no
wind
to
ruffle
the
man
hair
no
sound
of
a
falling
cone
or
of
dead
leaves
crackling
under
a
squirrel
foot
and
yet
the
man
had
the
air
now
of
one
listening
hearkening
to
the
silence
itself
for
silence
among
the
pines
is
not
the
dead
void
of
desert
lands
but
a
great
hush
like
the
command
in
a
sleeper
room
or
the
still
message
of
a
held
to
the
ear
the
countless
millions
of
cedar
and
pine
needles
seemed
as
motionless
as
the
very
mountains
themselves
yet
it
was
they
who
laid
the
gently
audible
command
upon
the
balmy
afternoon
and
whispered
the
great
hush
that
whisper
the
man
heard
it
seemed
to
him
less
with
his
ears
than
with
his
soul
he
went
back
to
the
tree
against
which
he
had
rested
and
picked
up
his
hat
and
a
small
canvas
roll
and
yet
again
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
stood
motionless
his
eyes
lingering
along
the
cliff
tops
across
the
little
lake
his
attitude
that
of
a
man
listening
to
an
invitation
which
he
would
like
to
accept
but
in
the
end
meant
to
refuse
already
he
had
marked
out
the
way
he
planned
to
go
and
still
the
nearer
peaks
with
the
sunshine
upon
them
called
to
him
one
would
have
hazarded
that
they
were
familiar
from
visits
and
that
among
his
plans
to
the
contrary
a
desire
to
climb
them
insisted
he
glanced
at
the
sun
again
shook
his
head
and
took
the
first
step
slantingly
downward
along
the
slope
but
only
once
more
to
grow
as
still
as
the
big
trees
about
him
slowly
he
drew
back
into
the
shadows
to
watch
and
not
be
seen
for
abruptly
two
figures
had
appeared
upon
the
rocky
head
of
the
mountain
across
the
lake
they
had
come
up
from
the
further
side
and
when
he
saw
them
first
stood
against
the
sky
they
might
have
been
hunters
since
each
carried
a
rifle
and
yet
the
watcher
brows
gathered
in
a
frown
and
his
eyes
glinted
angrily
the
two
figures
separated
one
going
along
the
crest
of
the
ridge
the
other
climbing
downward
cautiously
until
he
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
he
craned
his
body
to
look
down
as
though
seeking
a
way
to
the
lake
he
straightened
and
stared
for
a
long
time
toward
the
snow
tops
of
the
more
distant
altitudes
the
sun
lay
in
pools
all
about
him
and
across
the
distance
separating
him
and
his
companion
from
the
man
who
watched
them
so
intently
his
gestures
could
be
followed
readily
he
turned
and
must
have
said
something
to
his
companion
who
leaped
down
from
a
boulder
and
came
to
his
side
the
second
man
towered
over
him
head
and
shoulder
this
the
eyes
upon
the
other
slope
were
quick
to
note
they
cleared
briefly
as
though
with
a
new
understanding
only
to
grow
harder
than
before
they
talked
together
and
yet
the
only
sound
to
carry
across
the
lake
and
meadow
was
the
rush
of
air
through
innumerable
the
blue
water
glinted
softly
under
the
westering
sun
in
the
blue
void
of
the
sky
the
hawk
wheeled
silent
and
graceful
and
watchful
the
smaller
man
pointed
his
arm
outheld
steadily
the
other
drew
nearer
towering
above
him
he
too
pointed
or
seemed
about
to
point
they
stood
so
close
together
that
the
two
figures
merged
from
a
distance
they
looked
like
one
man
now
it
was
with
startling
abruptness
that
the
two
figures
were
torn
apart
each
resolved
again
into
an
individual
one
the
towering
man
had
drawn
suddenly
back
the
other
was
falling
and
yet
the
silence
was
unbroken
there
was
never
a
cry
to
echo
through
the
gorges
from
a
throat
the
falling
man
plunged
straight
down
a
dozen
feet
struck
against
a
ragged
rock
writhed
free
fell
again
a
few
feet
and
began
to
roll
there
had
been
the
flash
of
the
sun
on
the
rifle
in
his
hand
he
had
clutched
wildly
at
that
as
though
it
could
save
him
now
it
flew
from
his
grasp
as
he
rolled
over
and
over
plunging
down
the
steep
flank
of
the
mountain
the
man
who
had
watched
from
across
the
lake
had
not
stirred
the
big
man
on
the
cliffs
came
back
slowly
to
the
brink
and
crouched
there
looking
down
motionless
so
long
that
it
was
hard
for
the
eye
to
be
sure
of
him
to
know
if
it
were
really
a
human
being
or
a
poised
boulder
squatting
there
there
came
no
call
from
below
the
hawk
wheeled
and
wheeled
lost
interest
drifting
away
in
the
little
hollow
where
the
lake
glinted
it
was
very
still
with
the
soft
perfection
of
the
first
spring
days
the
man
on
the
cliff
stood
up
holding
his
rifle
he
had
done
with
looking
down
now
he
pivoted
slowly
looking
off
in
all
other
directions
presently
he
began
climbing
back
up
the
few
feet
to
the
crest
from
which
he
had
descended
not
five
minutes
ago
he
paused
there
for
hardly
more
than
an
instant
and
then
went
on
down
the
further
side
out
of
sight
the
man
who
had
seen
all
this
from
his
own
slope
caught
up
his
canvas
roll
again
and
hurried
down
toward
the
lake
for
the
first
time
he
spoke
aloud
saying
swen
brodie
there
not
another
man
in
the
mountains
brute
enough
for
that
he
hastened
on
taking
the
shortest
way
making
nothing
of
the
steepest
slopes
he
was
going
straight
toward
the
nearer
end
of
the
lake
which
he
must
skirt
to
come
up
the
further
mountain
and
to
the
man
who
had
fallen
and
by
the
way
straight
toward
the
peak
still
bright
in
the
sunlight
which
he
had
wanted
to
revisit
all
along
much
of
the
descent
of
the
long
slope
was
taken
at
a
run
on
ploughing
heels
he
crossed
the
springy
meadow
at
a
but
the
climb
to
the
fallen
man
was
another
matter
the
sun
was
appreciably
lower
the
shadows
already
made
dusky
tangles
among
the
trees
when
the
man
carrying
the
canvas
roll
came
at
last
under
the
cliffs
from
out
these
shadows
before
his
keen
eyes
found
the
man
they
sought
he
heard
a
voice
calling
faintly
that
you
brodie
no
brodie
gone
the
voice
though
very
weak
sharpened
perceptibly
you
who
are
you
what
difference
does
it
make
if
you
need
help
who
said
i
wanted
help
not
brodie
no
not
brodie
he
dropped
his
roll
and
began
working
his
way
through
the
bushes
presently
he
came
to
a
spot
from
which
he
could
see
a
figure
propped
up
against
a
tree
there
was
a
rifle
across
the
man
knees
gripped
in
both
hands
and
yet
surely
the
rifle
had
been
whirled
out
of
his
hands
in
his
fall
then
he
was
not
hurt
badly
after
all
since
he
had
managed
to
work
his
way
back
up
to
it
oh
it
you
is
it
king
the
man
against
the
tree
did
not
seem
overjoyed
there
was
a
sullen
note
in
his
voice
king
came
on
breaking
his
way
through
the
brush
hello
he
said
a
little
taken
aback
it
you
is
it
i
thought
it
would
be
but
he
did
not
say
who
he
came
on
and
stood
over
the
man
on
the
ground
stooping
for
an
instant
to
peer
close
into
his
face
hurt
much
he
asked
the
answer
was
a
long
time
coming
the
face
was
bloodlessly
grey
from
it
a
pair
of
shallow
brown
eyes
looked
shiftily
a
tongue
ran
back
and
forth
between
the
colourless
lips
it
my
leg
he
said
i
do
know
if
it
broke
and
i
sort
of
bunged
up
he
looked
up
sharply
oh
i
be
all
right
he
grunted
and
do
you
fool
yourself
did
brodie
the
man
began
to
tremble
the
hands
on
his
gun
shook
so
that
the
weapon
veered
and
wavered
uncertainly
yes
rot
his
soul
he
began
to
curse
at
first
softly
then
with
a
strained
voice
rising
into
a
storm
of
windy
incoherence
suddenly
he
broke
off
eyeing
king
with
suspicion
upon
the
surface
of
his
shallow
eyes
what
are
you
after
i
did
know
how
badly
you
were
hurt
i
came
to
see
if
i
could
lend
you
a
hand
you
know
i
do
mean
that
what
are
you
after
here
in
the
mountains
his
voice
was
surly
with
truculence
king
grew
angry
and
burst
out
bluntly
the
devil
take
you
andy
parker
i
wanted
to
help
you
if
you
take
my
interference
kindly
i
be
on
my
way
he
turned
to
be
off
why
the
man
was
not
already
dead
from
that
fall
he
did
not
know
but
if
the
fellow
was
able
to
shift
for
himself
it
suited
king
well
enough
he
had
business
of
his
own
and
no
desire
to
step
to
one
side
or
another
to
deal
with
swen
brodie
or
andy
parker
or
with
any
man
who
trailed
his
luck
with
such
as
these
but
now
parker
called
to
him
and
in
an
altered
voice
a
whine
running
through
the
words
hold
on
king
i
hung
up
here
for
the
night
anyhow
and
i
ai
got
a
bite
of
grub
and
already
i
burning
up
with
thirst
get
me
a
drink
will
you
without
answer
king
went
to
his
canvas
roll
and
parker
thinking
himself
deserted
began
to
plead
noisily
on
his
knees
king
opened
his
roll
got
out
a
cup
and
began
to
search
for
water
above
him
there
were
patches
of
snow
he
found
where
a
trickle
of
clear
cold
water
ran
in
a
narrow
rivulet
and
presently
returned
to
the
injured
man
with
a
brimming
cup
parker
drank
thirstily
demanded
more
and
sank
back
with
a
long
sigh
the
thing
unlucky
you
know
king
he
said
queerly
is
it
said
king
coolly
it
was
like
him
not
to
pretend
that
he
did
not
know
to
what
andy
parker
thoughts
had
flown
parker
nodded
pursing
his
lips
and
kept
on
nodding
like
a
broken
automatic
toy
at
the
end
he
jerked
his
head
up
and
muttered
there
been
the
devil
luck
on
it
for
more
sixty
years
and
maybe
a
thousand
years
before
that
oh
know
look
how
it
went
with
those
the
last
one
of
the
seven
got
it
look
how
it
happens
with
old
man
loony
honeycutt
clucking
and
chuckling
and
stepping
up
and
down
in
his
shadow
all
the
time
gone
nuts
from
just
of
it
look
what
happens
to
me
all
stove
up
here
he
paused
and
then
spat
out
venomously
oh
it
get
swen
brodie
and
it
get
you
too
mark
king
you
see
another
drink
before
i
go
demanded
king
parker
put
his
fingers
to
his
scalp
and
examined
them
for
traces
of
blood
i
got
a
terrible
headache
he
said
aching
and
singing
and
sort
of
dizzy
king
went
for
more
water
this
time
filling
his
one
when
he
returned
parker
was
trying
to
stand
he
had
drawn
himself
up
holding
to
the
tree
with
both
shaking
hands
putting
his
weight
gingerly
on
one
leg
suddenly
his
weak
hands
gave
way
he
swayed
and
fell
king
standing
over
him
thought
at
first
he
was
dead
so
white
and
still
was
he
but
parker
had
only
fainted
the
sun
sank
lower
the
shadows
down
about
the
lake
shores
thickened
and
began
to
run
more
and
more
swiftly
up
the
surrounding
slopes
the
tall
peaks
caught
the
last
of
the
fading
light
and
like
so
many
blazed
across
the
wilderness
upward
about
their
bases
surged
the
flooding
shadows
like
a
dark
tide
rising
swiftly
the
light
on
the
tallest
spire
winked
and
went
out
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
rush
of
air
through
the
pine
tops
strengthened
and
a
growing
murmur
like
the
voice
of
a
distant
surf
made
it
seem
that
one
could
hear
the
flood
of
the
night
sweeping
through
gorge
and
cañon
and
inundating
the
world
and
despite
all
that
mark
king
could
do
the
sunset
glow
had
gone
and
the
first
big
star
was
shining
before
andy
parker
stirred
his
first
call
was
for
water
then
he
complained
of
a
terrible
pain
in
his
vitals
a
pain
that
stabbed
him
through
from
chest
to
abdomen
thereafter
he
was
never
coherent
again
though
for
the
most
part
he
babbled
like
a
noisy
brook
he
spoke
of
swen
brodie
and
old
loony
honeycutt
and
gus
ingle
all
in
one
breath
and
king
knew
that
gus
ingle
was
sixty
years
dead
he
dwelt
hectically
on
the
luck
of
the
unlucky
seven
and
when
far
on
in
the
night
he
at
length
grew
silent
and
king
went
to
peer
into
his
face
by
the
light
of
his
andy
parker
was
dead
mark
king
made
the
grave
in
the
dawn
in
his
roll
the
handle
slipped
out
so
that
it
might
lie
snug
against
the
steel
head
was
a
short
miner
pick
a
little
below
where
parker
lay
in
his
last
vigil
under
the
stars
king
found
a
fairly
level
space
free
of
rock
and
carpeted
in
young
grass
here
with
a
to
mark
head
and
foot
he
worked
at
the
shallow
grave
he
put
his
own
blanket
down
laid
the
quiet
figure
gently
upon
it
bringing
the
ends
over
to
cover
him
he
marked
the
spot
with
a
pile
of
rocks
he
blazed
the
two
trees
it
was
all
that
he
could
do
far
more
than
andy
parker
would
have
done
for
him
or
for
any
other
man
the
sun
was
rising
when
he
made
his
way
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
and
came
to
stand
where
he
had
seen
parker
and
swen
brodie
side
by
side
he
clambered
on
until
he
came
to
the
very
crest
over
which
swen
brodie
had
disappeared
just
where
had
brodie
gone
he
wondered
the
answer
came
before
the
question
could
have
been
put
into
words
though
it
was
full
day
across
the
heights
where
king
stood
it
would
be
an
hour
and
longer
before
the
sun
got
down
into
the
cañons
and
meadows
he
saw
the
flare
of
a
shining
bright
through
the
dark
of
a
flat
two
miles
or
more
from
his
brodie
would
be
cooking
his
breakfast
now
after
that
king
did
not
again
climb
up
where
his
body
would
stand
out
against
the
sky
which
was
filling
so
brightly
with
the
new
morning
he
moved
along
the
ridge
steadily
and
swiftly
like
a
man
with
a
definite
objective
who
did
not
care
to
be
spied
on
in
twenty
minutes
after
many
a
hazardous
passage
along
a
steep
bare
surface
he
came
to
a
spot
where
the
knife
edge
of
the
ridge
was
broken
down
and
blunted
into
a
fairly
level
space
a
hundred
yards
across
here
was
an
accumulation
of
soil
worn
down
from
the
granite
above
and
here
an
odd
isolated
tuft
of
scrawny
verdure
grew
a
small
grove
of
trees
stunted
pine
and
scraggling
brush
toward
the
far
end
of
this
upland
flat
was
the
disintegrating
ruin
of
a
cabin
the
walls
had
disappeared
long
ago
save
for
two
or
three
rotting
logs
but
a
small
rectangle
of
slightly
raised
ground
indicated
how
they
had
extended
even
the
rock
chimney
had
fallen
away
but
something
of
the
fireplace
black
with
burning
stood
where
labouring
hands
had
placed
it
more
than
half
a
century
before
here
he
made
his
own
breakfast
from
what
was
ready
cooked
in
his
pack
dispensing
with
the
fire
which
would
inevitably
tell
brodie
of
his
presence
for
brodie
callously
brutish
as
he
was
must
be
something
less
than
human
not
to
turn
his
chill
blue
icelandic
eyes
toward
the
spot
where
he
had
abandoned
his
fallen
companion
king
first
interest
was
centred
on
the
ground
underfoot
he
went
back
and
forth
and
about
the
ruin
of
the
cabin
several
times
seeking
any
sign
that
would
tell
him
if
brodie
and
andy
parker
had
been
here
before
him
but
there
were
no
tracks
in
the
softer
soil
no
grass
it
was
very
likely
that
no
foot
had
come
here
since
king
own
last
october
a
look
of
satisfaction
shone
for
an
instant
in
his
eyes
then
done
with
this
keen
examination
they
went
with
curious
eagerness
to
the
more
distant
landscape
he
passed
through
the
trees
and
to
the
far
rim
of
the
flat
where
he
stood
a
long
time
staring
frowningly
at
one
after
another
of
the
spires
and
ridges
lifted
against
the
sky
probing
into
the
mystery
of
the
night
still
slumbering
in
the
ravines
now
his
look
had
to
do
in
intent
concentration
with
a
slope
not
five
hundred
yards
off
now
with
a
summit
toward
which
a
man
might
toil
all
day
and
all
night
before
reaching
he
might
have
been
the
figure
of
the
explorer
grim
and
hard
and
determined
silent
and
solitary
in
a
land
of
silence
and
solitude
brooding
over
a
region
where
the
trails
run
out
and
stop
something
urged
something
called
and
his
blood
responded
about
him
rose
the
voice
of
the
endless
leagues
of
pines
in
a
hushed
utterance
which
might
have
been
the
whisper
something
hidden
go
and
find
it
go
and
look
behind
the
ranges
something
lost
behind
the
ranges
lost
and
waiting
for
you
go
he
made
sure
that
he
had
left
no
sign
of
his
visit
here
not
so
much
as
a
fallen
crust
of
bread
caught
up
his
pack
and
found
the
familiar
way
down
the
cliffs
striking
off
toward
the
higher
mountains
and
the
high
pass
through
which
he
would
travel
to
have
followed
the
pace
which
he
set
that
day
would
have
broken
the
heart
of
any
but
a
seasoned
mountaineer
no
man
in
these
mountains
could
have
so
much
as
kept
him
in
sight
saving
alone
swen
brodie
and
he
was
left
far
back
yonder
miles
on
the
other
lower
side
of
the
ridge
by
king
had
outstripped
the
springtime
and
was
among
snow
patches
which
grew
in
frequency
and
extent
at
noon
he
built
his
little
fire
on
a
snow
crust
he
crossed
a
raging
tributary
of
the
american
travelling
upward
along
the
gorge
a
full
mile
before
he
came
to
the
possible
precarious
ford
at
six
he
made
a
second
fire
in
a
bleak
windy
pass
surrounded
by
a
glimmering
ghostly
waste
trees
were
stiff
with
frost
the
wind
whistled
and
jeered
through
them
and
about
sharp
crags
filling
the
crisp
air
with
eerie
shuddersome
music
he
set
his
coffee
to
boil
while
meditating
that
down
in
the
sacramento
valley
which
one
could
glimpse
from
here
by
day
it
was
stifling
hot
like
midsummer
he
rested
by
his
fire
with
his
canvas
drawn
up
about
his
shoulders
smoked
his
pipe
remade
his
pack
and
went
on
he
counted
on
the
moon
presently
and
a
bed
at
a
slightly
lower
altitude
among
the
trees
andy
parker
was
sleeping
in
his
army
blanket
he
crunched
along
over
the
snow
crust
which
rarely
failed
him
and
though
the
daylight
passed
swiftly
the
surface
seemed
to
hold
an
absorbed
radiance
and
shed
it
softly
by
the
time
he
got
down
to
the
again
the
moon
was
up
he
left
the
country
of
five
lakes
well
to
his
left
ignoring
the
invitation
of
the
trail
beyond
down
the
tall
walls
of
squaw
creek
cañon
he
went
straight
down
the
long
pitch
of
the
mountain
heading
tenaciously
toward
the
tiny
lakelet
which
so
far
as
he
knew
had
been
nameless
until
his
old
friend
ben
gaynor
had
built
a
summer
home
there
two
years
ago
and
had
christened
the
pond
among
the
trees
lake
gloria
mark
king
liked
the
appellation
little
enough
telling
himself
with
unreason
that
there
was
a
silly
name
to
fit
to
perfection
a
silly
girl
but
altogether
out
of
place
to
tie
on
to
an
unspoiled
sierra
lake
ben
would
have
done
a
better
job
in
naming
it
lake
vanity
or
king
could
think
of
a
score
of
designations
more
to
the
point
for
though
he
had
never
so
much
as
set
his
eyes
on
either
gloria
or
her
mother
he
had
his
own
opinion
of
both
of
them
nor
did
he
in
the
least
realize
that
that
opinion
was
based
rather
less
on
actual
knowledge
than
moulded
by
his
own
peculiar
form
of
jealousy
that
jealousy
which
one
friend
feels
when
the
other
allows
love
of
women
to
occupy
a
higher
place
than
friendship
he
made
his
camp
at
eight
in
a
sheltered
spot
among
the
firs
he
built
a
fire
made
a
mat
of
boughs
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
canvas
and
went
promptly
to
sleep
he
awoke
cold
got
his
blood
running
by
stamping
about
put
on
fresh
fuel
and
went
to
sleep
again
his
feet
toward
the
blaze
half
a
dozen
times
he
was
up
during
the
night
before
dawn
he
had
his
coffee
boiling
before
the
sun
was
up
he
was
well
on
his
way
again
driving
the
cramped
chill
out
of
him
by
walking
vigorously
and
at
nine
that
morning
he
stood
on
the
bench
of
a
timbered
slope
whence
looking
downward
through
the
trees
he
got
his
first
glimpse
of
lake
gloria
and
of
the
rambling
log
house
which
ben
gaynor
had
been
prevailed
on
to
build
here
in
the
wild
a
dozen
miles
from
the
lake
tahoe
road
he
noted
as
he
came
nearer
swinging
along
down
the
slope
and
seeing
the
little
valley
with
its
green
meadow
and
azure
lake
how
ben
had
had
a
log
dam
thrown
across
the
pond
lower
end
backing
up
the
water
and
making
it
widen
out
he
saw
a
couple
of
graceful
canoes
resting
tranquilly
on
their
own
reflections
a
pretty
already
green
with
lusty
ben
gaynor
had
been
spending
money
a
good
deal
of
money
and
no
one
knew
better
than
mark
king
that
ben
had
been
these
latter
years
he
shrugged
telling
himself
to
pull
up
short
and
not
find
fault
with
his
friend
or
what
his
friend
did
or
with
those
whom
his
friend
loved
an
hour
later
he
came
to
the
grove
of
back
of
the
house
here
he
paused
a
moment
though
he
was
all
eagerness
for
his
meeting
with
gaynor
he
had
seen
a
number
of
persons
coming
out
of
the
house
a
dozen
or
more
pouring
out
brightly
as
gay
as
butterflies
men
and
women
their
laughter
floated
out
to
him
through
the
still
sunny
morning
the
deeper
notes
of
men
a
cluster
of
rippling
notes
from
a
girl
he
wanted
to
see
gaynor
not
a
lot
of
gaynor
san
francisco
guests
no
not
gaynor
rather
the
friends
of
gaynor
womenfolk
it
was
king
hope
that
they
were
going
down
toward
the
lake
thus
he
would
avoid
meeting
them
he
come
in
at
the
back
have
his
talk
with
ben
and
be
on
his
way
without
the
bore
of
shaking
a
lot
of
flabby
hands
and
listening
to
a
lot
of
gushing
exclamations
he
stood
very
still
where
he
was
unseen
as
he
leaned
against
a
pine
a
girl
broke
away
from
the
knot
of
figures
ran
a
few
steps
down
the
path
toward
the
lake
poised
gracefully
executed
a
stagy
little
pose
with
head
back
and
arms
outflung
as
though
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
that
the
world
was
so
fair
she
was
a
bright
spot
of
colour
with
her
pink
dress
and
white
shoes
and
stockings
and
lacy
parasol
and
brown
hair
and
for
a
little
his
eyes
went
after
her
quite
as
they
would
have
followed
the
flight
of
a
brilliant
bird
then
as
in
sheer
youth
as
one
who
during
a
night
of
refreshing
sleep
has
been
steeped
body
and
soul
in
the
elixir
that
is
youth
own
she
yielded
her
young
body
up
to
an
extravagant
dance
whirling
away
as
light
as
thistledown
across
the
meadow
hands
clapped
after
her
voices
men
voices
filled
her
ears
with
a
clamour
of
praise
as
extravagant
as
her
own
dancing
the
guests
went
trooping
gaily
after
her
king
seized
his
chance
and
went
swiftly
toward
the
house
as
he
went
he
noted
that
the
girl
alone
was
watching
him
she
was
facing
him
while
the
others
had
turned
their
backs
upon
the
house
she
had
abandoned
her
dance
and
was
standing
very
still
obviously
interested
in
the
booted
figure
which
had
seemed
so
abruptly
to
materialize
from
the
forest
land
ben
gaynor
had
seen
him
through
a
window
and
met
him
at
the
door
their
hands
met
in
the
way
of
old
friendship
gripping
hard
further
ben
beat
the
dust
out
of
his
shoulders
with
a
open
palm
as
he
led
the
way
inside
my
wife
has
been
saying
for
years
that
you
a
myth
said
gaynor
the
gleam
in
his
eyes
as
youthful
as
it
had
ever
been
that
you
are
no
more
flesh
and
blood
than
the
unicorn
or
the
dodo
bird
i
show
her
they
were
up
half
the
night
dancing
and
fussing
around
she
will
be
down
in
two
shakes
though
in
the
meantime
we
can
talk
said
king
i
got
something
to
tell
you
ben
gaynor
led
the
way
through
a
room
where
were
piano
and
victrola
and
from
the
floor
of
which
the
rugs
were
still
rolled
through
a
and
into
what
was
at
once
a
small
library
and
gaynor
study
king
noted
that
even
a
telephone
had
found
its
way
hither
a
chair
pulled
forward
a
box
of
cigars
offered
and
the
two
friends
took
stock
in
each
eyes
of
what
the
last
year
had
done
for
each
you
look
more
fit
than
ever
mark
and
younger
king
wanted
to
say
the
same
thing
of
his
friend
but
the
words
did
not
come
gaynor
was
by
far
the
older
man
king
senior
by
a
score
of
years
and
obviously
had
begun
to
feel
the
burden
of
the
latter
greying
days
or
of
cares
flocking
along
with
them
they
generally
come
together
his
were
seriously
accepted
responsibilities
where
mark
gathered
unto
himself
fresh
hopes
and
eager
joys
the
responsibilities
which
come
in
the
wake
of
wife
and
daughter
a
home
to
be
maintained
in
the
city
the
necessity
to
adapt
himself
even
if
stiffly
to
unfamiliar
conditions
this
big
log
house
itself
it
seemed
to
king
was
carried
on
the
back
of
old
ben
they
had
been
friends
together
since
king
could
remember
since
ben
had
him
carried
him
on
his
back
taught
him
to
swim
and
shoot
then
one
year
while
king
was
off
at
school
his
friend
took
unto
himself
a
wife
this
with
no
permission
from
mark
king
not
even
after
a
conference
with
him
in
fact
to
his
utter
bewilderment
king
did
not
so
much
as
know
of
the
event
until
gaynor
after
a
month
of
honeymooning
remembered
to
drop
him
a
brief
note
the
bald
fact
jarred
king
was
hurt
and
grew
angry
and
resentful
with
all
of
that
unreason
of
a
boy
he
went
off
to
alaska
without
a
word
to
gaynor
with
the
passage
of
time
the
friends
had
again
grown
intimate
had
been
partners
in
more
than
one
deal
and
the
youthful
relationship
had
been
cemented
by
the
years
but
it
had
happened
seemingly
purely
through
chance
although
king
knew
better
that
he
had
never
met
gaynor
wife
or
daughter
when
gloria
was
little
gaynor
had
been
impressed
by
the
desirability
of
a
city
environment
had
urged
the
larger
schools
music
teachers
proper
young
companions
and
a
host
of
somewhat
vague
advantages
hence
a
large
part
of
the
year
gaynor
kept
quarters
in
his
own
little
lumber
town
in
the
mountains
where
his
business
interests
held
him
and
where
his
wife
and
daughter
came
during
a
few
weeks
in
the
summer
to
visit
him
at
such
periods
king
always
managed
to
be
away
this
year
the
wife
and
daughter
drawn
by
the
new
summer
home
had
come
early
in
the
season
and
king
business
was
urgent
besides
he
had
told
himself
a
dozen
times
there
really
existed
no
sane
reason
in
the
world
why
he
should
avoid
ben
gaynor
family
as
though
they
were
leprous
what
king
said
in
answer
to
his
friend
approval
was
by
way
of
a
bantering
miracles
do
happen
here
ben
gaynor
playing
he
a
bird
of
paradise
or
emulating
beau
brummel
which
is
it
ben
and
whence
the
fine
idea
gaynor
with
a
strange
sort
of
smile
king
thought
half
sheepish
and
the
other
half
tender
cast
a
downward
glance
along
the
encasement
of
the
outer
man
silk
shirt
a
very
pure
white
bright
tie
very
new
white
flannels
very
spick
and
span
silken
hose
and
low
white
ties
this
garb
for
ben
gaynor
the
lumberman
who
felt
not
entirely
at
his
ease
hence
the
sheepish
grin
a
fond
father
decked
out
by
his
daughter
as
king
well
guessed
hence
that
gleam
of
tenderness
gloria
doings
he
chuckled
sent
ahead
from
san
francisco
with
explicit
commands
i
guess
i
wear
a
if
she
said
so
mark
but
none
the
less
his
eyes
as
they
appraised
the
rough
garb
of
his
guest
were
envious
i
can
breathe
better
just
the
same
in
boots
like
yours
he
concluded
he
stretched
his
long
arms
high
above
his
head
i
wish
i
could
get
out
into
the
woods
for
a
spell
with
you
mark
and
he
did
not
know
did
not
in
the
least
suspect
that
he
was
failing
the
minutest
iota
in
his
loyalty
to
gloria
and
her
mother
he
was
thinking
only
of
their
guests
whom
he
could
not
quite
consider
his
own
the
very
thing
said
king
eagerly
that
just
what
i
want
but
gaynor
shook
his
head
and
his
thin
aristocratic
face
was
briefly
overcast
and
for
an
instant
shadows
crept
into
his
eyes
no
can
do
mark
he
said
quietly
not
this
time
i
got
both
hands
full
and
then
some
king
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
his
hand
gripping
gaynor
knee
ben
it
there
i
always
known
it
always
been
willing
to
bet
my
last
dollar
now
i
gamble
my
life
on
it
gaynor
mouth
tightened
and
his
eyes
flashed
between
you
and
me
mark
he
said
in
a
voice
which
dropped
confidentially
i
like
mighty
well
to
have
my
share
right
now
gone
in
pretty
deep
here
of
late
a
little
over
my
head
it
begins
to
look
i
branched
out
where
i
would
have
better
played
my
own
game
and
been
content
with
things
as
they
were
going
i
but
he
broke
off
suddenly
he
was
close
to
the
edge
of
disloyalty
now
what
makes
you
so
sure
he
asked
i
came
up
this
time
from
georgetown
you
remember
the
old
trail
up
by
gerle
red
cliff
and
hell
hole
leaving
french
meadows
and
gate
and
mount
mildred
off
to
the
left
i
had
it
all
pretty
much
my
own
way
until
i
came
to
lookout
ridge
and
who
do
you
suppose
i
found
poking
around
there
not
old
loony
honeycutt
cried
gaynor
then
he
laughed
at
himself
for
allowing
an
association
of
ideas
to
lead
to
so
absurd
a
thought
of
course
not
honeycutt
i
saw
him
last
week
as
you
wanted
me
to
and
he
is
down
in
coloma
as
usual
ca
drag
his
wicked
old
feet
out
of
his
yard
who
then
mark
swen
brodie
then
and
andy
parker
gaynor
frowned
impressed
as
king
had
been
before
him
but
he
objected
as
he
pondered
he
might
have
been
there
for
some
other
reason
brodie
i
mean
remember
that
the
ancient
and
pastimes
of
the
kentucky
mountains
have
come
into
vogue
in
the
west
everybody
knows
and
that
includes
even
the
government
agents
in
san
francisco
that
there
is
a
lot
of
moonshine
being
made
in
places
of
the
california
mountains
there
a
job
for
swen
brodie
and
his
crowd
there
talk
of
it
mark
maybe
king
admitted
but
brodie
was
looking
for
something
and
not
revenue
men
at
that
he
and
parker
were
up
on
the
cliffs
not
a
from
the
old
cabin
they
stood
close
together
right
at
the
edge
parker
fell
brodie
looked
down
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
off
smoking
his
stinking
pipe
most
likely
i
buried
parker
the
next
morning
poor
devil
said
gaynor
then
his
brows
shot
up
and
he
demanded
you
mean
brodie
did
for
him
shoved
him
over
that
exactly
what
i
mean
but
i
ca
tie
it
to
brodie
not
so
that
he
could
shake
himself
free
of
it
parker
did
say
so
in
so
many
words
i
saw
the
whole
thing
from
the
mountain
across
the
lake
too
far
to
swear
to
anything
like
that
but
this
i
can
swear
to
brodie
was
in
there
for
the
same
thing
we
been
after
for
ten
years
and
what
is
more
it
open
and
shut
that
he
was
of
a
mind
to
play
and
pushed
andy
parker
over
to
simplify
matters
in
my
mind
even
though
i
ca
hope
to
ram
that
down
a
jury
how
do
you
what
brodie
and
parker
were
after
andy
parker
he
was
sullen
and
for
the
most
part
until
delirium
got
him
then
he
babbled
by
the
hour
and
all
his
talk
was
of
gus
ingle
and
the
devil
luck
of
the
unlucky
seven
with
every
now
and
then
a
word
for
loony
honeycutt
and
swen
brodie
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
devil
luck
said
gaynor
with
a
sober
look
to
his
face
this
thing
seems
plastered
thick
with
it
king
grunted
his
derision
we
take
a
chance
ben
he
said
and
after
all
one
man
bane
is
another
man
bread
you
know
now
i
told
you
my
tale
let
have
yours
you
saw
honeycutt
could
you
get
anything
out
of
him
only
this
that
you
are
dead
right
about
his
knowing
or
thinking
that
he
knows
he
is
feebler
than
he
was
last
fall
a
great
deal
feebler
both
in
body
and
mind
all
day
he
sits
on
his
steps
in
the
sun
and
peers
through
his
bleary
eyes
across
the
mountains
and
chuckles
to
himself
like
an
old
hen
i
know
what
you
after
he
cackles
at
me
shrewd
enough
to
hit
the
nail
square
too
mark
he
rambles
on
come
to
the
right
man
but
am
i
goin
to
blab
now
havin
kept
a
shut
mouth
all
these
years
and
then
he
goes
on
his
eyes
blinking
to
proclaim
that
he
is
feeling
a
whole
lot
stronger
these
days
that
he
is
getting
his
second
wind
so
to
speak
that
come
he
be
as
frisky
as
a
colt
and
that
then
he
means
to
have
what
is
his
own
and
that
is
as
close
as
he
ever
comes
to
saying
anything
about
this
one
thing
i
mean
he
chatter
like
a
magpie
about
anything
else
even
his
own
youthful
evil
deeds
he
seems
to
know
somehow
that
no
longer
has
the
law
any
interest
in
his
old
carcass
and
begins
to
brag
a
bit
of
the
wild
days
up
and
down
the
forks
of
the
american
and
of
his
own
share
in
it
all
half
lies
and
the
other
half
truth
i
swear
it
makes
a
man
shiver
to
listen
to
the
old
he
ca
live
a
thousand
years
mused
king
he
is
eighty
now
if
a
day
by
his
own
estimate
but
when
it
a
question
of
that
he
sits
there
and
sucks
at
his
toothless
old
gums
and
giggles
that
it
the
first
hundred
years
that
are
the
hardest
to
get
through
with
and
gettin
away
with
he
knows
something
ben
so
do
we
or
think
we
do
so
does
brodie
it
would
seem
does
old
honeycutt
know
any
more
than
the
rest
of
us
we
are
all
young
men
compared
with
loony
honeycutt
all
youngsters
gus
ingle
and
his
crowd
as
near
as
we
can
figure
came
to
grief
in
the
winter
of
by
old
honeycutt
own
count
he
would
have
been
a
wild
young
devil
of
seventeen
then
and
remember
he
was
one
of
the
roaring
crowd
that
made
the
country
what
it
was
after
he
knows
where
the
old
cabin
was
on
lookout
he
swears
he
knows
who
built
it
in
that
same
winter
of
and
and
cut
in
gaynor
if
you
believe
the
murderous
old
rascal
he
knows
with
sly
intimate
knowledge
how
and
why
the
man
in
the
lone
cabin
was
killed
all
in
that
same
winter
of
king
pricked
up
his
ears
i
did
know
that
what
does
he
say
he
talks
on
most
subjects
pretty
much
at
random
he
knows
that
the
sheriff
only
laughs
at
him
since
who
would
want
to
snatch
the
old
derelict
away
from
his
mountains
after
all
these
years
and
try
to
fix
a
crime
of
more
than
half
a
century
ago
on
him
but
as
the
law
laughs
and
at
least
pretends
to
disbelieve
his
pride
is
hurt
so
he
has
grown
into
the
way
of
wild
boasting
you
ought
to
hear
him
talk
about
the
affair
at
murderer
bar
it
makes
a
man
shiver
to
stand
there
in
the
sunshine
and
hear
him
and
with
the
rest
of
his
drivelling
braggadocio
to
hear
him
tell
it
hinting
broadly
it
was
a
boy
of
seventeen
who
carrying
nothing
but
an
axe
did
for
the
poor
devil
in
the
cabin
and
i
for
one
believe
him
what
is
more
i
am
dead
certain
call
it
a
hunch
if
you
like
that
if
he
had
had
the
use
of
his
legs
all
these
years
he
have
gone
straight
as
a
string
where
we
are
trying
to
get
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
frowning
brodie
has
been
hanging
around
him
lately
has
he
yes
brodie
and
steve
jarrold
and
andy
parker
and
the
rest
of
worthless
crowd
of
illicit
they
hang
out
in
the
old
mcquarry
shack
cheek
by
jowl
with
honeycutt
i
saw
them
thick
as
flies
while
i
was
there
last
week
brodie
it
seems
has
even
been
cooking
the
old
man
meals
for
him
there
you
are
burst
out
king
what
more
do
you
want
imagine
swen
brodie
turning
over
his
hand
for
anybody
on
earth
if
there
something
in
it
all
for
swen
brodie
and
i
go
bond
he
giving
honeycutt
the
best
most
nourishing
meals
that
have
come
his
way
since
his
mother
suckled
him
swen
brodie
bound
on
keeping
him
alive
until
he
gets
what
he
after
when
he
kick
old
honeycutt
in
the
side
and
leave
him
to
die
like
a
dog
with
a
broken
back
well
demanded
gaynor
what
to
be
done
with
all
his
jabberings
honeycutt
is
sly
and
furtive
and
is
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
there
is
one
thing
he
wo
tell
will
you
go
and
see
him
one
more
time
what
the
good
mark
if
he
does
know
he
gets
lockjaw
at
the
first
word
i
tried
there
one
thing
we
have
tried
old
honeycutt
is
as
greedy
a
miser
as
ever
gloated
over
a
pile
of
hoardings
we
get
a
thousand
dollars
five
thousand
if
necessary
in
hard
gold
coin
if
we
have
to
rob
the
mint
for
it
you
spread
it
on
the
table
in
his
kitchen
you
let
it
chink
and
you
let
some
of
it
drop
and
roll
if
that
wo
buy
the
knowledge
we
want
but
it
will
i
known
the
time
when
five
thousand
was
as
much
money
as
it
is
right
now
mark
i
got
it
if
i
scrape
deep
and
i
dig
down
to
the
bottom
and
if
we
draw
a
blank
but
there
was
a
step
at
the
door
the
knob
was
turning
mark
king
turned
utterly
unconscious
of
the
quick
stiffening
of
his
body
as
he
awaited
the
introduction
to
ben
wife
at
first
king
was
taken
aback
by
ben
youthfulness
or
look
of
youth
as
he
understood
presently
he
knew
that
she
was
within
a
few
years
of
ben
age
and
yet
certainly
she
showed
no
signs
of
it
to
his
eyes
which
though
keen
enough
were
after
a
male
fashion
unsophisticated
she
was
a
very
pretty
woman
alert
and
decidedly
winsome
he
understood
in
a
flash
why
ben
should
have
been
attracted
to
her
how
she
had
held
him
to
her
own
policies
all
these
years
largely
because
they
were
hers
she
was
dressed
daintily
her
glossy
brown
hair
was
becomingly
arranged
about
the
bright
smiling
face
she
chose
to
be
very
gracious
to
her
husband
friend
giving
him
a
small
plump
hand
in
a
welcoming
grip
establishing
him
in
an
instant
by
some
sleight
of
femininity
which
king
did
not
plumb
as
a
hearthside
intimate
most
affectionately
regarded
his
first
two
impressions
of
her
arriving
almost
but
not
quite
simultaneously
were
of
youthful
prettiness
and
cleverness
she
slipped
to
a
place
on
the
arm
of
gaynor
chair
her
hand
whose
beauty
caught
and
held
king
eyes
for
a
moment
toying
with

gaynor
was
what
is
known
as
a
born
hostess
very
charming
hostess
to
her
husband
of
whom
she
saw
somewhat
less
each
year
than
of
a
number
of
other
friends
she
had
always
the

dark

which
were
always
animated
with
expression
if
she
was
not
more
at
his
side
the
matter
was
simply
explained
she
adored
their
daughter
gloria
no
less
and
probably
somewhat
more
and
gloria
needed
her
surely
gaynor
needs
those
of
a
grown
man
were
less
than
those
of
a
young
girl
whose
budding
youth
must
be
perfected
in
flower
and
if
ben
was
indefatigable
in
keeping
herself
young
while
ben
quietly
accepted
the
gathering
years
it
was
with
no
thought
of
coquetting
with
other
men
but
only
that
she
might
remain
an
older
sister
to
her
daughter
maintain
the
closer
contact
and
see
that
gloria
made
the
most
of
life
any
small
misstep
which
she
herself
had
made
in
life
her
daughter
must
be
saved
from
making
all
of
her
unsatisfied
yearnings
must
be
fulfilled
for
gloria
she
constituted
herself
and
handmaiden
for
their
daughter
if
it
were
necessary
to
engrave
another

line
in

followed
his
wife
pridefully
when
at
the
end
of
fifteen
pleasant
sunny
minutes
she
left
them
and
then
went
swiftly
to
his
friend
face
seeking
approbation
and
he
found
it
king
had
risen
as
she
went
out
holding
himself
with
a
hint
of
stiffness
as
was
his
unconscious
way
when
infrequently
in
the
presence
of
women
now
he
turned
to
ben
with
an
odd
smile
pretty
tardy
date
to
congratulate
you
old
man
he
said
with
a
laugh
do
believe
i
ever
remembered
it
before
did
i
ben
glowed
and
rubbed
his
long
hands
together
in
rich
contentment
she
a
wonder
mark
he
said
heartily
mark
nodded
an
emphatic
approval
words
which
ben
perhaps
looked
for
he
did
not
add
everything
had
been
said
in
the
one
word
congratulate
sprang
from
good
old
pioneer
stock
too
mark
said
gaynor
think
now
to
look
at
her
that
she
was
born
at
gold
run
in
a
family
as
rugged
as
yours
and
mine
would
you
with
precious
few
advantages
until
she
was
a
girl
grown
look
at
what
she
has
made
of
herself
while
you
and
i
and
the
likes
of
us
have
been
content
to
stay
pretty
much
in
the
rough
she
has
there
not
a
more
accomplished
cultured
little
woman
this
or
the
other
side
boston
even
if
she
did
hail
from
gold
run
and
as
for
gloria
all
her
doing
why
and
he
chuckled
she
has
the
slightest
idea
i
suppose
that
she
ever
had
a
grandfather
who
sweated
and
went
about
in
and
chewed
tobacco
and
swore
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
a
grandfather
laughed
king
look
at
me
challenged
gaynor
thrusting
into
notice
his
immaculate
attire
he
chuckled
one
must
live
down
his
disgraceful
past
for
his
daughter
you
know
from
without
came
a
gust
of
shouts
and
laughter
from
the
gaynor
guests
skylarking
along
the
lake
shore
come
said
ben
you
have
to
meet
the
crowd
mark
and
i
want
you
to
see
my
little
girl
i
told
her
so
many
yarns
about
you
that
dying
of
curiosity
king
though
he
would
have
preferred
to
tramp
ten
miles
over
rough
trails
gleaning
small
joy
from
meeting
strangers
not
of
his
sort
who
would
never
be
anything
but
strangers
to
him
accepted
the
inevitable
without
demur
and
followed
his
host
he
would
shake
hands
say
a
dozen
stupid
words
and
escape
for
a
good
long
talk
with
ben
then
before
the
he
would
be
off
gaynor
led
the
way
toward
a
side
door
passing
through
a
hallway
and
a
wide
thus
they
came
abreast
of
a
wide
stairway
leading
to
the
second
storey
down
the
glistening
treads
making
her
entrance
like
the
heroine
in
a
play
just
at
the
proper
instant
in
answer
to
her
cue
came
gloria
gloria
called
gaynor
papa
said
miss
gloria
i
wanted
oh
you
are
not
alone
instinctively
king
frowned
now
why
did
she
say
that
he
asked
within
himself
for
she
had
seen
him
coming
to
the
house
himself
circuitous
ways
even
in
trifles
awoke
his
distrust
come
here
my
dear
said
ben
mark
this
is
my
little
girl
gloria
you
know
all
about
this
wild
man
he
is
mark
king
indeed
yes
cried
gloria
she
came
smiling
down
the
stairway
a
fluffy
pink
puffball
floating
her
two
hands
were
out
ingenuously
pretty
little
hands
which
had
done
little
in
this
world
beyond
adorn
charmingly
the
extremities
of
two
soft
round
arms
for
an
instant
king
felt
the
genial
current
within
him
frozen
as
he
stiffened
to
meet
the
girl
he
had
watched
in
the
extravagant
dance
down
to
the
lake
then
getting
his
first
near
view
of
her
his
eyes
widened
he
had
never
seen
anything
just
like
her
with
that
he
began
realizing
dully
that
he
was
straying
into
strange
pastures
he
took
her
two
hands
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
feeling
just
a
trifle
awkward
in
the
unaccustomed
act
he
looked
down
into
gloria
face
which
was
lifted
so
artlessly
up
to
his
hers
were
the
softest
tenderest
grey
eyes
he
had
ever
looked
into
he
had
the
uneasy
fear
that
his
hard
rough
hands
were
rasping
the
fine
soft
skin
of
hers
yet
there
was
a
warm
pleasurable
thrill
in
the
contact
gloria
was
very
much
alive
and
and
beautiful
she
was
like
those
flowers
which
king
knew
so
well
fragrant
dainty
blossoms
which
lift
their
little
faces
from
the
highest
of
the
old
mountains
into
the
rarest
of
skies
growths
seeming
to
partake
of
some
celestial
perfection
hardy
though
they
clothed
themselves
in
an
outward
seeming
of
fragile
delicacy
he
emphasized
the
word
and
barricaded
himself
behind
it
as
though
he
were
on
the
defence
against
her
she
came
nearer
perfection
than
he
had
thought
a
girl
could
come
and
nowhere
did
he
find
a
conflicting
detail
from
the
tendril
of
sunny
brown
hair
touching
the
curve
of
the
sweet
young
face
to
the
little
feet
in
their
clicking
shoes
thus
from
the
beginning
he
thought
of
her
in
superlatives
and
thus
did
gloria
like
the
springtime
coquetting
with
an
aloof
and
silent
wilderness
make
her
bright
entry
into
mark
king
life
i
have
been
like
a
comanche
indian
outside
laughed
gloria
it
was
she
who
withdrew
her
hands
king
started
inwardly
wondering
how
long
he
had
been
holding
them
how
long
he
would
have
held
them
if
she
had
not
been
so
serenely
mistress
of
the
moment
my
hair
was
all
tumbling
down
and
i
had
to
run
upstairs
to
fight
it
back
where
it
belongs
is
a
girl
hair
a
terrible
affliction
king
one
of
these
days
when
papa
back
is
turned
i
going
to
cut
it
off
short
like
a
boy
an
explanation
of
her
presence
in
the
house
while
her
guests
were
still
in
the
yard
why
explain
so
trifling
a
matter
a
suggestion
that
she
retained
that
lustrous
crown
of
hair
just
to
please
her
papa
whereas
one
who
had
not
been
told
might
have
been
mistaken
in
his
belief
that
this
should
be
one
of
her
greatest
prides
two
little
fibs
for
miss
gloria
yet
certainly
very
small
fibs
which
hurt
no
one
gloria
eyes
despite
their
soft
tenderness
were
every
whit
as
quick
as
mark
king
when
they
were
as
now
intrigued
of
course
both
she
and
king
had
heard
countless
references
one
of
the
other
from
ben
gaynor
but
neither
had
been
greatly
interested
king
had
known
that
there
was
a
baby
girl
long
ago
that
fact
had
been
impressed
on
him
with
such
rare
eloquence
that
it
had
created
a
mental
picture
which
until
now
had
been
vivid
and
like
an
indelible
drawing
he
had
known
had
he
ever
paused
for
reflection
which
he
had
not
that
a
baby
would
not
stay
such
during
a
period
of
eighteen
years
she
had
heard
a
thousand
tales
of
my
good
friend
mark
mark
thus
had
been
in
her
mind
a
man
of
her
father
age
and
about
such
a
young
girl
romantic
ideas
do
not
flock
but
from
the
first
glimpse
of
the
booted
figure
among
the
trees
she
had
sensed
other
things
king
would
have
blushed
had
he
known
how
picturesque
he
bulked
in
her
eyes
how
now
while
she
smiled
at
him
so
ingenuously
she
was
doing
his
masculinity
full
tribute
how
the
ruggedness
of
him
the
very
scent
of
the
resinous
pines
he
bore
along
with
him
the
clear
manlike
look
of
his
eyes
and
the
warm
dusky
tan
of
face
and
hands
even
the
effect
of
the
careless
worn
boots
and
the
muscular
throat
showing
through
an
open
put
a
delicious
little
shiver
of
excitement
into
her
miss
gloria
had
a
pretty
way
of
commanding
half
beseeching
and
yet
altogether
tyrannical
king
having
agreed
to
stay
to
luncheon
was
in
the
bathroom
off
gaynor
room
shaving
gloria
had
caught
her
father
and
dragged
him
off
into
a
corner
oh
papa
he
is
simply
magnificent
why
did
you
me
why
he
is
a
bit
old
and
and
she
made
him
repaint
for
her
the
high
lights
of
an
episode
of
mark
king
making
a
name
for
himself
and
a
fortune
at
the
same
time
in
the
klondike
country
she
danced
away
singing
to
her
abandoned
friends
who
were
returning
to
the
house
it
mark
king
my
dears
she
told
them
triumphantly
not
unconscious
of
the
depressing
result
of
her
disclosures
upon
a
couple
of
boys
of
the
college
age
who
adored
openly
and
with
frequent
lapses
from
glorious
hope
to
bleak
despair
the
man
who
made
history
in
the
klondike
the
man
who
fought
his
way
alone
across
fifteen
hundred
miles
of
snow
and
ice
and
won
oh
i
do
know
kind
of
a
fight
against
all
kinds
of
odds
the
very
mark
king
he
papa
best
friend
you
know
let
him
be
your
dad
friend
then
said
the
young
fellow
with
the
pampered
pompadour
his
eyes
showing
a
glint
of
sullen
jealousy
no
reason
why
archie
cried
gloria
you
are
making
yourself
just
horrid
you
do
want
to
make
me
sorry
i
ever
invited
you
here
do
you
and
a
brief
ago
archie
had
flattered
himself
that
gloria
dancing
had
been
chiefly
for
him
they
were
all
of
gloria
set
with
one
noteworthy
exception
him
she
called
gratton
while
the
others
were
archie
and
teddy
and
georgia
and
evelyn
and
connie
it
was
to
this
gratton
that
she
turned
having
made
a
piquant
face
at
the
dejected
college
youth
will
like
him
immensely
i
know
she
said
while
the
ears
of
poor
archie
reddened
even
as
he
was
being
led
away
by
the
not
very
pretty
but
extremely
comforting
georgia
he
a
real
man
every
inch
of
him
every
inch
a
king
she
thought
quickly
unashamed
of
the
pun
a
big
man
who
does
big
things
in
a
big
way
she
ran
on
indicating
that
she
too
after
that
brief
meeting
had
been
lured
into
superlatives
gratton
smiled
urbanely
for
his
own
part
he
might
have
been
called
every
inch
a
concrete
expression
of
suavity
he
was
clad
in
the
conventional
outdoor
rig
shining
puttees
lying
bravely
about
the
shape
of
his
leg
brown
outing
breeches
creased
laced
at
their
abbreviated
ends
shirt
of
the
sport
effect
a
man
of
with
ambitions
a
chalky
complexion
and
a
very
weak
mouth
with
full
red
lips
miss
gloria
he
whispered
as
he
managed
to
have
her
all
to
himself
a
moment
you
make
me
jealous
she
was
used
to
him
saying
stupid
things
yet
she
laughed
and
seemed
pleased
gratton
egotistically
supposed
her
thought
was
of
him
king
would
have
been
amazed
to
know
that
she
was
already
watching
the
house
for
his
coming
and
he
would
have
been
no
end
amazed
and
bristling
with
defence
had
he
glimpsed
the
astonishing
fact
that
gloria
already
fully
and
clearly
meant
to
parade
him
before
her
summer
friends
as
her
latest
and
most
virile
admirer
gratton
pale
eyes
trailed
over
her
speculatively
that
forenoon
king
shook
hands
with
archie
teddy
gratton
and
the
rest
made
his
formal
bows
to
gloria
girl
friends
and
felt
relief
when
the
inept
banalities
languished
and
he
was
free
to
draw
apart
gratton
with
slender
finger
to
his
shadowy
moustache
bore
down
upon
him
king
did
not
like
this
suave
individual
he
had
the
habit
of
judging
a
man
by
first
impressions
and
sticking
stubbornly
to
his
snap
judgment
until
circumstance
showed
him
to
be
in
error
he
liked
neither
the
way
gratton
walked
nor
talked
he
had
no
love
for
the
cut
of
his
eye
now
he
resented
being
approached
when
there
was
no
call
for
it
never
was
there
a
more
friendly
man
anywhere
than
mark
king
when
he
found
a
never
a
more
aloof
at
times
like
this
one
i
have
been
tremendously
interested
gratton
led
off
ingratiatingly
in
the
things
i
have
heard
of
you
king
by
george
men
like
you
live
the
real
life
the
wild
fancy
came
booming
upon
king
to
kick
him
over
the
verandah
railing
think
so
he
said
coolly
wondering
despite
himself
what
things
gratton
had
heard
of
him
and
from
whom
his
spirit
groaned
within
him
at
the
thought
that
old
ben
gaynor
had
been
lured
into
paths
along
which
he
should
come
to
hobnob
with
men
like
gratton
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
promised
to
stay
to
lunch
his
thoughts
all
of
a
sudden
were
restive
flying
off
to
swen
brodie
to
loony
honeycutt
to
what
he
must
get
done
without
too
much
delay
gratton
startled
him
by
speaking
bringing
his
thoughts
back
from
across
the
ridges
to
the
sunny
verandah
overlooking
lake
gloria
gratton
was
nobody
fool
save
his
own
and
both
marked
and
resented
king
attitude
his
heavy
lids
had
a
fluttering
way
at
times
during
which
his
prominent
eyes
seemed
to
flicker
what
the
chance
with
gus
ingle
this
year
mr
king
he
demanded
silkily
king
wheeled
on
him
what
do
you
know
about
it
he
said
sharply
and
who
has
been
talking
to
you
gratton
laughed
looked
wise
and
amused
and
strolled
away
at
luncheon
gaynor
placed
her
guests
at
table
out
on
the
porch
conscious
of
her
daughter
watchful
eye
when
all
were
seated
mark
king
found
himself
with
miss
gloria
at
his
right
and
an
unusually
plain
and
unattractive
girl
named
georgia
on
his
left
everybody
talked
king
alone
contenting
himself
with
brevities
over
dessert
he
found
himself
drifting
into
with
miss
gloria
they
pushed
back
their
chairs
he
found
himself
still
drifting
this
time
physically
and
still
with
gloria
as
they
two
strolled
out
through
the
grove
at
the
back
of
the
log
house
there
was
a
splendid
pool
there
a
thoroughly
romantic
sort
of
spot
in
gloria
gaynor
fancies
a
most
charming
background
for
springtime
loitering
the
gush
and
babble
of
the
bright
water
tumbling
in
rushing
out
filled
the
air
singingly
gloria
wanted
to
ask
king
about
a
certain
little
bird
which
she
had
seen
here
a
little
fellow
who
might
have
been
the
embodiment
of
the
joy
she
knew
from
her
father
that
king
was
an
intimate
friend
of
wild
things
and
could
tell
her
all
about
it
they
sat
in
gloria
favourite
nook
very
silent
now
and
then
with
a
whisper
from
gloria
awaiting
the
coming
of
the
bird
but
my
darling
daughter
gasped
gaynor
you
do
in
the
least
understand
what
you
are
about
but
my
darling
mother
mimicked
miss
gloria
light
of
tone
but
with
all
of
the
calm
assurance
of
her
years
i
do
know
exactly
what
i
am
about
i
always
do
and
anyway
with
a
frenchy
little
shrug
which
she
had
adopted
and
adapted
last
season
i
am
going
but
exclaimed
her
mother
already
routed
as
was
inevitable
and
now
looking
toward
the
essential
considerations
what
in
the
world
will
every
one
say
and
think
in
the
tall
mirror
before
her
gloria
regarded
her
boots
and
critically
then
her
little
hat
and
the
blue
flannel
short
too
mannish
never
with
gloria
in
them
an
expression
in
very
charming
curves
of
triumphant
girlhood
what
in
the
world
was
mark
king
thinking
of
demanded
her
mother
what
do
you
suppose
said
gloria
tranquilly
he
would
have
been
very
rude
if
he
had
been
thinking
of
your
little
daughter
besides
he
had
very
little
to
do
with
the
matter
gloria
and
what
is
more
there
was
a
moon
remember
that
mamma
she
tied
the
big
scarlet
silk
handkerchief
about
her
throat
and
turned
to
be
kissed
gaynor
looked
distressed
there
were
actually
tears
trying
to
invade
her
troubled
eyes
and
her
hands
were
nervous
but
you
will
be
gone
all
day
oh
mamma
gloria
began
to
grow
impatient
what
if
i
am
king
is
a
gentleman
is
he
he
is
going
to
eat
me
is
he
why
do
you
make
such
a
fuss
over
it
all
do
you
want
to
spoil
everything
for
me
you
know
i
do
but
we
had
nothing
but
since
i
told
you
i
should
have
left
you
a
note
and
slipped
out
she
bestowed
upon
the
worried
face
a
pecking
little
kiss
and
tiptoed
to
the
door
wait
gloria
what
shall
i
tell
every
one
they
your
after
all
tell
them
i
asked
to
be
excused
for
the
day
beyond
that
you
are
rather
good
at
smoothing
out
things
i
trust
you
but
i
mean
and
mr
gratton
oh
tell
him
to
go
to
the
devil
cried
gloria
it
will
do
him
no
end
of
good
and
while
gaynor
stared
after
her
she
closed
the
door
softly
and
went
tiptoeing
downstairs
and
out
into
the
brightening
dawn
where
mark
king
awaited
her
with
the
horses
from
behind
a
gloria
mother
watched
the
girl
tripping
away
through
the
meadow
to
the
stable
set
back
among
the
trees
king
was
leading
the
saddled
horses
to
meet
her
gloria
gave
him
her
gauntleted
hand
in
a
greeting
the
degree
of
friendliness
of
which
was
gauged
by
the
clever
eyes
at
the
window
friendliness
already
arrived
at
a
stage
of
intimacy
king
lifted
gloria
into
her
saddle
gloria
little
laugh
had
in
it
a
flutter
of
excitement
as
her
cavalier
strength
took
her
by
delighted
surprise
and
off
her
feet
they
rode
away
through
the
thinning
shadows
gaynor
despite
the
earliness
of
the
hour
went
straight
to
her
husband
awoke
him
mercilessly
and
told
him
everything
oh
he
said
when
she
had
done
and
he
had
turned
over
for
another
hour
or
so
of
sleep
that
all
right
mark
told
me
about
it
last
night
and
you
did
say
a
word
to
me
forgot
said
ben
but
do
worry
mark
take
care
of
her
she
left
him
to
his
innocent
slumbers
and
began
dressing
already
she
was
busied
with
planning
just
what
to
say
and
how
to
say
it
gloria
knew
she
thought
with
some
complacency
that
her
mother
could
be
depended
upon
in
any
situation
demanding
the
delicate
touch
she
would
be
about
cool
and
smiling
when
the
first
guest
appeared
it
would
be
supposed
that
she
and
gloria
and
king
had
been
quite
a
merry
trio
as
the
morning
adventure
was
being
arranged
that
first
guest
stirring
would
be
gratton
on
hand
to
pounce
on
gloria
and
get
her
out
of
the
house
for
a
run
down
to
the
lake
a
dash
in
a
canoe
or
a
brief
stroll
across
the
meadow
before
the
instead
of
gloria
terse
message
for
him
she
had
quite
an
elaborate
and
laughing
tale
to
tell
after
all
gloria
usually
did
know
what
she
was
about
and
if
gratton
meant
all
that
he
looked
gaynor
had
cast
up
a
rough
draft
of
everything
she
would
say
that
morning
before
she
opened
the
door
to
go
downstairs
and
for
reasons
very
clear
to
her
and
which
she
had
no
doubt
would
be
viewed
with
equal
clarity
by
gloria
after
this
escapade
of
hers
was
done
with
she
meant
to
be
very
tactful
indeed
with
gratton
never
had
mark
king
known
pleasanter
companionship
than
gloria
gaynor
afforded
this
bright
morning
they
passed
up
the
trail
over
the
first
ridge
dropped
down
into
a
tiny
wild
little
valley
and
had
the
world
all
alone
to
themselves
only
now
was
the
sun
up
and
there
in
the
mountains
blazing
forth
cheerily
it
seemed
to
shine
for
them
alone
when
they
rode
side
by
side
gloria
chatted
brightly
athrill
with
animation
vivid
with
her
rioting
youth
when
the
narrow
trail
demanded
and
she
rode
ahead
bright
little
snatches
of
lilting
song
or
broken
exclamations
floated
back
to
the
man
whose
eyes
shone
with
his
enjoyment
of
her
on
every
hand
this
was
all
a
bright
new
world
to
her
she
had
never
run
wild
in
the
hills
as
her
mother
had
done
through
her
girlhood
she
had
never
been
particularly
interested
in
all
of
this
sprawling
ruggedness
now
she
had
a
hundred
eager
questions
she
saw
the
shining
splendour
of
the
solitudes
through
king
eyes
she
turned
to
him
with
full
confidence
for
the
name
of
a
flower
the
habit
of
a
bird
even
though
the
latter
unseen
among
the
trees
had
only
announced
himself
by
a
enraptured
notes
yesterday
surrendering
her
volatile
self
to
a
very
natural
and
quite
innocent
feminine
instinct
gloria
had
fully
determined
to
parade
mark
king
before
her
envious
friends
as
very
much
her
own
property
it
was
merely
a
bit
of
the
game
the
old
old
game
at
which
she
being
richly
favoured
by
nature
was
as
skilful
as
a
girl
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
could
possibly
be
in
the
eternal
skirmish
she
was
an
enterprising
young
savage
with
many
scalps
dangling
from
her
triumphant
belt
the
petted
pompadour
of
poor
archie
the
curly
locks
of
teddy
the
stiff
black
brush
of
gratton
were
to
have
an
added
fellow
in
king
trophy
then
she
had
caught
a
word
between
her
father
and
his
friend
had
heard
honeycutt
mentioned
and
a
ride
to
coloma
and
on
the
break
of
the
instant
had
determined
with
a
young
will
which
invariably
went
unthwarted
that
high
adventure
was
beckoning
her
a
ride
on
horseback
through
the
mountains
with
a
man
who
had
stirred
her
more
than
a
little
who
filled
her
romantic
fancies
with
picturesque
glamour
who
was
on
a
quest
of
which
she
knew
ten
times
more
than
he
had
any
idea
she
knew
and
that
quest
itself
pure
golden
glamour
everywhere
hence
some
few
minutes
afterward
in
a
cosy
nook
of
the
verandah
while
the
others
danced
the
moon
and
gloria
were
serenely
victorious
king
once
assured
that
the
long
ride
was
not
too
hard
for
her
saw
no
slightest
reason
for
objecting
to
her
coming
he
did
not
think
of
all
of
that
which
would
mean
so
much
to
ben
wife
the
conventions
and
what
would
people
say
conventions
do
not
thrive
in
such
regions
as
the
high
sierra
ben
to
whom
king
mentioned
the
thing
looked
at
it
quite
as
did
his
friend
gloria
would
be
in
good
hands
and
ought
to
have
a
corking
good
time
he
wished
he
could
get
away
to
go
along
so
king
telephoned
to
san
francisco
arranged
to
have
three
thousand
dollars
in
cash
sent
immediately
to
him
at
coloma
and
fancied
himself
strictly
attending
to
business
with
an
undivided
mind
i
know
now
where
the
original
garden
of
eden
was
gloria
turning
to
look
back
at
him
as
he
came
on
through
a
delightful
flowery
upland
meadow
sat
her
horse
gracefully
upon
a
slight
hillock
herself
and
her
restless
mount
bathed
in
sunshine
her
cheeks
warm
with
the
flush
upon
them
her
lips
red
with
coursing
life
her
eyes
dancing
it
perfectly
lovely
it
pure
heavenly
king
nodded
and
smiled
he
was
not
given
to
many
words
grown
taciturn
as
are
mountaineers
inevitably
trained
in
long
habit
to
approve
in
silence
of
that
which
pleased
him
most
so
while
gloria
eager
tongue
tripped
along
as
busily
as
the
brooks
they
forded
he
was
for
the
most
part
silent
an
extended
arm
to
point
out
a
big
against
a
little
heap
of
snow
was
as
eloquent
as
the
spoken
word
thus
he
indicated
much
that
might
have
passed
unnoticed
by
gloria
keenly
enjoying
her
lively
admiration
he
chose
always
the
easier
trails
since
with
the
good
horses
under
them
they
had
ample
time
to
come
to
loony
honeycutt
place
well
before
midday
also
they
stopped
frequently
king
making
an
excuse
of
showing
her
points
of
interest
the
tiny
valley
where
one
could
be
sure
of
a
glimpse
of
a
brown
bear
the
of
mountain
deer
the
pass
into
the
of
the
picturesque
highwaymen
of
an
earlier
day
whence
they
drove
stolen
horses
into
nevada
where
they
secreted
other
horses
stolen
in
nevada
and
to
be
disposed
of
down
in
the
sacramento
valley
there
lasted
until
this
very
day
the
ruins
of
their
rock
house
snuggled
into
the
mountains
under
their
it
would
be
fun
said
gloria
the
spell
of
the
wilderness
mysteries
upon
her
her
eyes
half
wistful
and
altogether
serious
to
be
lost
out
here
just
to
get
far
far
away
from
people
and
ever
so
close
to
the
big
old
mountains
would
it
and
a
few
minutes
later
she
drew
in
her
horse
and
cried
out
softly
listen
she
herself
was
listening
breathlessly
it
sounds
like
the
ocean
ever
so
far
off
or
or
like
shouting
voices
a
million
miles
away
or
like
the
mountains
themselves
whispering
it
is
hard
to
believe
is
it
that
it
is
just
the
wind
in
the
pines
another
time
while
under
the
pretext
of
letting
their
horses
blow
king
had
suggested
a
short
halt
to
give
the
girl
a
chance
to
rest
she
said
with
abruptness
what
do
you
think
of
mr
gratton
already
she
knew
mark
king
well
enough
to
realize
that
he
would
either
refuse
to
answer
or
would
speak
his
mind
without
beating
about
the
bush
i
do
like
him
said
king
gloria
looked
thoughtful
neither
do
i
she
said
not
up
here
in
the
mountains
and
down
in
san
francisco
i
thought
him
rather
splendid
what
is
more
if
we
were
whisked
back
to
san
francisco
this
minute
i
probably
think
him
fine
again
she
appeared
interested
in
the
consideration
and
when
they
rode
on
was
silent
obviously
turning
the
matter
over
and
over
in
mind
were
three
mysteries
tremblingly
close
to
revealing
themselves
one
to
another
the
great
green
mystery
of
the
woodlands
the
mystery
of
a
man
clothed
in
his
masculinity
as
in
an
outer
garment
the
tender
mystery
of
a
young
girl
athrill
with
romance
effervescent
with
youth
her
own
thoughts
half
veiled
from
herself
her
instincts
alive
and
urgent
and
often
all
in
confusion
how
could
a
man
like
mark
king
quite
understand
a
girl
like
gloria
how
could
a
girl
like
gloria
with
all
of
her
surety
of
her
own
decisions
understand
a
man
like
king
each
glimpsed
that
day
much
of
the
other
true
character
and
yet
all
the
while
the
mainsprings
were
just
out
of
sight
unguessed
undreamed
of
at
gloria
age
if
one
be
a
girl
and
very
pretty
and
made
much
of
by
adoring
parents
and
a
host
of
boys
and
men
the
world
is
an
extremely
nice
place
inhabited
exclusively
by
individuals
pressing
forward
to
do
her
reverence
she
is
beautiful
she
is
vivacious
filled
with
delight
she
is
a
sparkling
fountainhead
of
joy
she
is
so
superabundantly
supplied
with
eager
happiness
that
she
radiates
happiness
if
she
thinks
a
very
great
deal
of
herself
so
for
that
matter
does
every
other
individual
in
the
world
it
is
merely
that
with
all
of
her
sophistication
she
remains
much
more
naive
than
she
would
ever
believe
she
is
a
coquette
because
she
is
female
she
is
pleased
with
herself
and
with
the
high
excuse
that
every
one
else
is
pleased
with
her
hence
she
demands
adoration
as
a
right
if
she
rides
on
a
she
fully
expects
that
the
conductor
will
regard
her
admiringly
and
that
the
motorman
will
turn
his
head
after
her
she
does
expect
to
marry
either
of
these
gentlemen
she
does
not
particularly
require
their
flattering
attentions
gloria
did
not
expect
to
marry
archie
or
teddy
or
gratton
she
had
no
thought
of
being
any
one
wife
that
term
after
all
at
gloria
age
is
a
drab
and
humdrum
thing
she
did
not
dream
of
mark
king
as
a
possible
husband
another
unromantic
title
she
merely
hungered
for
male
admiration
it
was
the
wine
of
life
the
breath
in
her
nostrils
as
it
happens
to
be
to
some
countless
millions
of
other
girls
all
of
which
is
so
clearly
a
pretty
nearly
universal
condition
that
it
would
seem
that
if
mark
king
had
had
his
wits
about
him
he
must
have
realized
it
and
yet
had
he
glimpsed
that
which
should
have
been
so
obvious
he
would
have
been
startled
somewhat
shocked
and
would
have
grieved
over
his
friend
daughter
holding
her
unmaidenly
when
she
was
but
dallying
with
dreams
which
mean
so
much
to
all
maidens
but
gloria
did
not
say
to
him
mark
king
i
am
determined
that
you
shall
adore
me
pretty
face
pretty
figure
pretty
ways
and
all
nor
yet
to
herself
did
she
put
things
so
baldly
she
did
however
yield
herself
luxuriously
to
the
springtime
the
romance
of
the
hour
the
appeal
of
her
latest
cavalier
and
preen
herself
like
a
mating
bird
king
saw
admired
and
in
his
own
fashion
played
his
own
part
it
was
not
clear
to
him
that
there
had
been
a
new
pleasure
in
his
own
strength
when
he
had
lifted
her
into
her
saddle
and
yet
her
little
breathless
laugh
had
rung
musically
in
his
ears
had
a
man
arisen
to
announce
jibingly
that
mark
king
was
showing
off
before
a
girl
like
a
boy
of
ten
though
within
bounds
he
would
have
called
the
man
a
liar
and
forthwith
have
kicked
him
out
of
the
landscape
they
rode
on
side
by
side
each
content
with
seeing
only
that
which
lay
on
the
surface
both
of
his
companion
and
of
himself
in
a
word
they
were
living
life
naturally
without
demanding
of
the
great
theatrical
manager
to
know
exactly
what
parts
they
were
to
play
in
the
human
comedy
externals
sufficed
just
now
the
fragrant
still
forests
the
sunshine
the
warm
fruitful
earth
below
and
the
blue
sky
above
from
the
first
he
called
her
gloria
quite
naturally
to
her
he
was
king
but
the
mark
slipped
out
before
they
came
into
sight
of
the
roofs
of
picturesque
coloma
you
are
sure
you
wo
be
gone
more
than
an
hour
gloria
asked
never
it
seemed
to
her
had
she
seen
a
place
than
old
coloma
drowsing
on
the
fringe
of
the
wilderness
the
street
into
which
they
had
ridden
was
deserted
save
for
a
couple
of
dogs
making
each
other
acquaintance
suspiciously
why
was
it
more
lonesome
here
than
it
had
been
back
there
in
the
mountains
she
wondered
less
than
an
hour
he
assured
her
what
business
i
have
can
be
done
in
fifteen
minutes
if
it
can
be
done
at
all
but
in
the
meantime
what
will
you
do
oh
said
gloria
i
just
poke
around
it
will
be
fun
to
see
what
kind
of
people
live
here
he
put
the
horses
in
the
stable
watered
and
fed
them
himself
and
came
back
to
her
outside
the
front
double
doors
she
had
dropped
down
on
a
box
in
the
sun
he
thought
that
there
was
a
little
droop
to
her
shoulders
and
small
wonder
he
admitted
with
a
tardy
sense
of
guilt
all
these
hours
in
the
saddle
tired
much
he
asked
solicitously
the
shoulders
straightened
like
a
soldier
she
jumped
up
and
whirled
smilingly
not
a
bit
tired
she
told
him
brightly
that
good
but
i
could
get
a
room
for
you
at
the
hotel
you
could
lie
down
and
rest
a
couple
of
hours
gloria
would
not
hear
to
it
if
she
did
want
to
lie
down
she
go
out
under
one
of
the
trees
and
rest
there
she
trudged
along
with
him
to
the
she
watched
as
mark
called
for
and
got
a
registered
parcel
further
she
marked
that
the
postmaster
appeared
curious
about
the
package
so
heavily
insured
until
over
mark
shoulder
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
and
that
thereafter
craning
his
neck
as
they
went
out
he
evidenced
a
greater
interest
in
her
than
in
a
bundle
insured
for
three
thousand
dollars
she
was
smiling
brightly
when
mark
king
hurried
off
to
his
meeting
with
old
loony
honeycutt
honeycutt
shanty
ancient
twisted
warped
and
ugly
like
himself
stood
well
apart
from
the
flock
of
houses
as
though
like
himself
even
in
this
it
were
suspicious
and
meant
to
keep
its
own
business
to
itself
only
one
other
building
had
approached
it
in
neighbourly
fashion
and
this
originally
had
been
honeycutt
barn
now
it
had
a
couple
of
crazy
windows
cut
crookedly
into
its
sides
and
a
stovepipe
thrust
up
also
crookedly
through
the
shake
roof
and
was
known
as
the
mcquarry
place
here
one
might
count
on
finding
swen
brodie
at
such
times
as
he
favoured
coloma
with
his
hulking
presence
here
foregathered
his
an
idle
crowd
for
the
most
part
save
when
the
devil
found
mischief
for
them
to
do
they
might
be
expected
to
be
represented
by
one
or
two
of
their
number
loafing
about
headquarters
and
king
realized
that
his
visit
to
loony
honeycutt
was
not
likely
to
pass
unnoticed
what
he
had
not
counted
on
was
finding
swen
brodie
himself
before
him
in
honeycutt
shanty
king
seeing
no
one
walked
through
the
weeds
to
honeycutt
door
the
door
was
closed
the
windows
down
dirty
windows
every
corner
of
every
pane
with
its
dirty
cobweb
trap
and
skeletons
of
flies
as
he
lifted
his
foot
to
the
first
of
the
three
front
steps
he
heard
voices
nor
would
any
man
who
had
once
listened
to
the
deep
sullen
bass
of
swen
brodie
have
forgotten
or
have
failed
now
in
quick
recognition
brodie
mouth
when
he
spoke
dripped
the
vilest
of
vocabularies
that
had
ever
been
known
in
these
mountains
very
much
as
old
honeycutt
toothless
mouth
ever
screwed
up
in
rotary
chewing
and
sucking
movements
drooled
tobacco
juice
upon
his
unclean
shirt
brodie
at
moments
when
he
desired
to
be
utterly
inoffensive
could
not
purge
his
utterance
of
oaths
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
could
not
remark
that
it
was
a
fine
morning
without
first
damning
the
thing
qualifying
it
with
an
epithet
of
vileness
and
turning
it
out
of
his
big
loose
mouth
sullied
with
syllables
which
do
not
get
themselves
into
print
what
king
heard
as
though
brodie
had
held
his
speech
for
the
moment
and
hurled
it
like
a
challenge
to
the
man
he
did
not
know
had
come
was
when
stripped
of
its
cargo
of
verbal
filth
you
old
fool
you
dying
right
now
it
for
me
or
mark
king
to
get
it
and
it
ai
going
to
be
king
honeycutt
all
the
time
was
whining
like
a
feeble
spirit
in
pain
his
utterances
like
the
final
dwindlings
of
a
dog
king
had
never
heard
him
whine
like
that
honeycutt
was
more
given
to
chucklings
and
clackings
of
defiance
and
derision
perhaps
brodie
as
the
ultimate
argument
had
manhandled
him
king
threw
open
the
door
there
stood
old
honeycutt
tremblingly
upheld
upon
his
beyond
him
facing
the
door
was
swen
brodie
his
immense
body
towering
over
honeycutt
spindling
one
his
bestial
face
hideous
in
its
contortions
as
at
once
he
gloated
and
threatened
in
hands
which
were
twice
the
size
of
an
ordinary
man
was
a
little
wooden
box
to
which
honeycutt
rheumy
eyes
were
glued
with
frantic
despair
evidently
the
box
had
only
now
been
taken
from
its
under
a
loose
board
in
the
floor
the
board
lay
tossed
to
one
side
and
brodie
legs
straddled
the
opening
honeycutt
did
not
know
immediately
that
any
one
had
entered
either
his
old
ears
had
not
heard
or
his
excited
mind
was
concentrated
so
excludingly
on
brodie
that
he
had
no
thought
of
aught
else
brodie
however
turned
his
small
restless
eyes
that
were
like
two
shiny
buttons
upon
the
intruder
his
great
mouth
stood
open
showing
his
teeth
on
that
lower
deformed
undershot
jaw
of
swen
brodie
were
those
monstrous
teeth
which
were
his
pride
a
misshapen
double
row
which
he
kept
clean
while
his
body
went
unwashed
and
between
which
the
man
could
bend
a
nail
swen
brodie
was
the
biggest
man
who
had
ever
come
to
the
mountains
men
said
unless
that
honour
went
to
one
of
the
seven
who
more
than
a
ago
had
perished
with
gus
ingle
and
even
so
brodie
kept
the
honour
in
his
own
blood
boasting
that
ingle
giant
companion
the
worst
of
a
bad
lot
was
his
own
father
father
the
elder
brodie
had
come
from
iceland
had
lived
with
a
squaw
had
sired
the
first
swen
brodie
and
this
last
scion
of
a
house
of
outlawry
and
depravity
the
blue
devil
as
many
called
him
stood
six
or
eight
clear
inches
above
mark
king
who
was
well
above
six
feet
whatever
pride
was
in
him
went
first
to
his
teeth
next
to
his
enormous
stature
he
denied
that
his
father
had
been
so
big
a
man
he
flew
into
a
towering
rage
at
the
suggestion
he
cursed
his
father
memory
as
a
fabric
of
lies
his
head
was
all
face
flattening
off
an
inch
above
the
hairless
brows
his
face
was
all
enormous
mouth
slowly
the
big
mouth
closed
the
shiny
blue
eyes
narrowed
and
glinted
the
coarse
face
reddened
brodie
throat
corded
the
adam
apple
moved
repeatedly
up
and
down
as
he
swallowed
inarticulately
this
old
honeycutt
saw
he
jerked
about
and
quick
lights
sprang
up
in
his
despairing
eyes
he
began
to
sputter
but
brodie
loud
voice
had
come
back
to
him
and
drowned
out
the
old
man
shrillings
brodie
ripped
out
a
string
of
oaths
demanding
who
told
to
come
in
you
you
he
was
aiming
to
kill
me
cried
old
honeycutt
dragging
and
pulling
at
king
sleeve
he
was
for
doin
for
me
like
that
he
pointed
to
the
floor
there
lay
a
heavy
iron
poker
bent
double
he
done
it
brodie
done
it
he
was
for
doin
me
you
old
fool
i
do
you
yet
growled
brodie
and
you
king
what
are
you
after
always
truculent
brodie
was
plainly
spoiling
for
trouble
king
had
stepped
in
at
a
moment
when
brodie
was
in
no
mood
to
brook
any
interruption
or
interference
i
came
for
a
word
with
honeycutt
not
with
you
king
flashed
back
at
him
and
from
the
look
of
things
honeycutt
is
thanking
his
stars
that
i
did
come
if
you
mean
anything
by
that
shouted
brodie
threateningly
put
a
name
to
it
if
it
a
fight
you
want
said
king
sharply
i
ready
to
take
you
on
any
time
and
without
a
lot
of
palaver
old
honeycutt
began
sidling
off
toward
the
back
door
neither
of
his
two
visitors
noticing
him
now
as
their
eyes
clashed
what
i
come
for
i
going
to
have
announced
brodie
it
mine
anyhow
more
than
any
other
man
i
could
prove
it
by
law
if
i
gave
the
snap
of
a
finger
for
what
the
law
deals
out
hit
or
miss
was
there
a
king
with
gus
ingle
crowd
or
a
honeycutt
no
but
there
was
a
brodie
and
i
his
heir
by
thunder
it
mine
more
any
man
king
laughed
at
him
since
when
have
you
been
studying
law
brodie
since
you
got
back
this
last
trip
figuring
you
might
have
a
word
with
the
sheriff
sheriff
what
do
you
mean
sheriff
i
happened
to
see
you
and
andy
parker
standing
together
on
the
cliffs
i
saw
andy
go
overboard
what
is
more
i
had
a
talk
with
him
before
i
buried
him
again
brodie
big
mouth
dropped
open
his
little
blue
eyes
rounded
and
he
put
one
hand
at
his
throat
nervously
andy
a
liar
always
a
liar
he
said
thickly
but
he
seemed
annoyed
then
his
face
cleared
and
he
too
laughed
derision
in
his
tone
anyway
he
dead
and
ca
lie
no
more
and
your
word
against
mine
ai
more
an
even
break
so
if
your
nosing
sheriff
gets
gay
with
me
i
twist
his
cursed
neck
for
him
suit
yourself
i
told
you
already
i
came
for
a
talk
with
honeycutt
and
not
with
you
then
you
wait
until
i
done
with
him
roared
brodie
all
of
his
first
baffled
rage
sweeping
back
through
his
blood
and
now
clear
out
king
stooped
forward
just
a
little
gathering
himself
and
ready
as
he
saw
brodie
crouch
for
a
spring
it
was
just
then
that
both
remembered
old
honeycutt
for
the
old
man
tottering
in
the
opening
of
the
rear
door
was
muttering
in
a
wicked
sort
of
glee
up
with
them
hands
of
swen
brodie
high
up
an
right
quick
or
i
blow
your
ugly
head
your
shoulders
in
his
trembling
hands
was
a
shotgun
sawed
off
and
doubtless
loaded
to
the
muzzle
with
buckshot
though
the
thing
wavered
considerably
its
end
was
not
six
feet
from
brodie
head
and
both
hammers
were
back
while
the
ancient
nervous
fingers
were
playing
as
with
palsy
about
the
triggers
king
expected
the
discharge
each
second
brodie
whirled
and
drew
back
his
face
turning
grey
put
it
down
you
old
fool
put
it
down
he
cried
raspingly
i
go
the
old
man
cackled
in
his
delight
i
put
nothin
down
he
announced
triumphantly
you
set
down
that
box
hastily
brodie
put
it
on
the
table
he
drew
further
away
backing
toward
the
front
door
git
cried
old
honeycutt
they
could
hear
the
air
rushing
back
into
brodie
lungs
as
he
came
to
the
door
and
his
fear
left
him
i
be
back
honeycutt
do
you
fear
he
growled
savagely
as
for
you
king
you
and
me
ai
done
i
get
you
where
there
no
old
fool
to
butt
in
and
i
break
every
bone
in
your
body
i
be
ready
brodie
said
king
he
watched
the
great
hulking
figure
as
it
went
out
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
brawn
there
every
ounce
of
it
packed
with
power
and
the
cunning
of
brutish
battle
if
he
ever
fought
swen
brodie
just
man
to
man
with
only
the
weapons
nature
gave
them
what
would
the
end
be
but
brodie
was
gone
his
shadow
withdrawn
from
the
doorstep
and
he
had
his
business
with
honeycutt
he
left
the
door
wide
open
so
that
no
one
might
come
suddenly
upon
them
and
turned
to
the
old
man
put
your
gun
down
honeycutt
he
said
quietly
i
want
to
talk
with
you
i
got
the
big
stiff
on
the
run
mumbled
the
old
man
he
cai
come
an
bulldoze
me
not
me
he
cai
no
nor
if
swen
brodie
cai
git
the
best
of
me
no
other
man
can
he
added
meaningly
glaring
at
king
there
that
box
on
the
table
said
king
maybe
you
want
to
put
it
away
before
he
makes
you
another
visit
honeycutt
hastily
set
his
gun
down
leaning
it
against
the
wall
with
both
hammers
still
back
and
shambled
to
the
table
he
caught
the
box
up
and
hugged
it
to
his
thin
old
breast
breathing
hard
if
there
money
in
it
said
king
knowing
well
that
the
old
miser
had
money
secreted
somewhere
who
said
there
was
money
who
said
so
he
went
to
his
tumbled
bunk
in
a
corner
sat
down
on
it
thrusting
the
box
out
of
sight
under
the
untidy
heap
of
dirty
bedding
i
ai
talkin
he
said
he
glanced
at
his
gun
you
too
king
felt
that
he
could
not
have
selected
a
more
inopportune
moment
for
his
visit
and
already
began
to
fear
that
he
would
have
no
success
but
it
began
to
look
as
though
it
were
a
question
of
now
or
never
brodie
would
return
despite
the
shotgun
and
brodie
might
now
be
looked
to
for
methods
so
in
face
of
the
bristling
hostility
he
was
set
in
his
determination
to
see
the
thing
through
to
one
end
or
another
to
catch
an
interest
which
he
knew
was
always
readily
awakened
he
said
brodie
and
parker
were
on
lookout
ridge
day
before
yesterday
brodie
shoved
parker
over
lookout
honeycutt
he
stressed
the
words
significantly
while
keenly
watching
for
the
gleam
of
interest
in
the
faded
eyes
it
came
honeycutt
jerked
his
head
up
i
wish
i
of
shot
him
he
wailed
i
wish
to
god
i
of
blowed
his
ugly
head
off
it
might
have
saved
trouble
admitted
king
coolly
also
it
might
have
been
the
job
to
hang
you
honeycutt
better
leave
well
enough
alone
but
listen
to
me
brodie
told
you
and
he
meant
it
that
it
was
going
to
be
brodie
or
king
who
got
away
with
this
deal
he
lied
like
you
lie

honeycutt
probed
in
his
tenderest
spot

in
that

a
pair
of
palsied
fists

cackled
and
rubbed
his
hands
at
the
admission
but
i
going
to
find

probably
is
brodie
now
look
here
honeycutt
i
have
come
to
browbeat
you
as
brodie
did
i
am
for
making
you
a
straight
business

ready
to

knowledge

cold
hard
cash
no

money

not
any
morgan
or
king
began
opening
the
parcel
he
had
brought
from
the
as
he
cut
the
heavy
cord
with
his
honeycutt
looked
on
curiously
king
stepped
to
the
table
standing
so
that
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
he
commanded
both
doors
and
stripped
off
the
look
sharp
honeycutt
he
commanded
here
money
enough
to
last
you
as
long
as
you
live
all
yours
if
you
can
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
a
golden
coin
rolled
free
shone
with
its
virgin
newness
and
lay
on
the
gleaming
its
lure
into
the
covetous
old
eyes
another
followed
it
and
another
king
regretted
that
there
were
not
more
that
the
parcel
contained
banknotes
for
the
most
part
he
began
counting
it
out
there
one
thousand
dollars
right
in
that
pile
he
said
one
thousand
dollars
one
thousand
dollars
an
some
of
it

me
have
the
feel
of

king
tossed
it
it
fell
upon
the
bedding
and
honeycutt
fingers
dived
after
it
and
held
it
tight
he
began
rubbing
it
caressing
it
king
went
on
counting
one
more
thousand
in
this
pile
he
said
that
two
thousand
honeycutt
two
thousand
repeated
honeycutt
nodding
he
was
sucking
at
his
lips
his
mouth
puckered
his
cheeks
sunken
in
he
got
up
and
shambled
on
his
cane
close
to
the
table
leaning
against
it
thrusting
his
peering
eyes
down
king
counted
out
the
last
crisp
note
three
thousand
dollars
he
stepped
back
a
pace
three
thousand
dollars
that
a
might
of
money
mark
three
thousand
dollars
all
on
my
table
his
thin
voice
was
a
hushed
whisper
now
i
never
seen
that
much
money
not
all
at
once
and
spread
out
it
likely
that
you
never
see
that
much
again
unless
you
and
i
do
business
honeycutt
did
not
answer
perhaps
had
not
heard
his
emaciated
arms
were
uplifted
he
had
let
his
cane
go
supporting
himself
by
leaning
hard
against
the
table
his
arms
curved
inward
his
fingers
were
like
claws
standing
apart
slowly
the
hands
descended
the
fingers
began
gathering
the
few
gold
pieces
stacking
them
lingering
with
each
separate
one
smoothing
at
it
gold
spoke
directly
and
eloquently
to
what
stood
for
a
soul
in
loony
honeycutt
banknotes
had
a
voice
which
he
understood
but
which
could
never
move
him
thrill
him
lift
him
to
ecstatic
heights
as
pure
musical
beautiful
gold
could
it
a
sight
of
money
mark
he
whispered
it
a
sight
of
money
king
held
his
silence
his
whole
argument
was
on
the
table
only
now
and
then
did
king
catch
a
glimpse
of
honeycutt
eyes
for
the
most
part
hidden
by
his
lowered
lids
and
bent
head
at
such
times
though
he
had
counted
on
having
to
do
with
cupidity
he
was
startled
by
the
look
he
saw
here
was
the
expression
of
the
one
emotion
which
dwelt
on
in
the
withered
body
here
was
in
one
of
its
ten
thousand
forms
love
that
is
burning
desire
that
quenches
all
other
spark
of
the
spirit
that
is
boundless
love
of
a
hideously
grotesque
and
deformed
sort
love
defiled
twisted
misshapen
as
though
eros
had
become
an
ugly
malformed
leering
monstrosity
that
love
which
is
the
expression
of
the
last
degree
of
selfish
greed
since
it
demands
all
and
gives
nothing
that
love
which
is
like
a
rank
weed
choking
tenderer
growths
or
more
like
a
poisonous
snake
now
it
dominated
the
old
man
utterly
the
world
beyond
the
rectangular
top
of
the
table
did
not
exist
now
its
elixir
poured
through
his
arteries
so
that
for
the
first
time
in
months
there
came
pinkish
spots
upon
the
withered
cheeks
showing
through
the
scattering
soiled
grey
hairs
of
his
beard
suddenly
king
went
to
the
door
standing
in
the
sunshine
filling
his
lungs
with
the
outside
air
the
sight
of
the
gloating
miser
sickened
him
more
than
that
it
sickened
his
fancies
so
that
for
a
minute
he
asked
himself
what
he
and
brodie
were
doing
the
lure
of
gold
the
thing
had
hypnotized
him
he
wished
that
he
were
out
in
the
mountains
riding
among
the
pines
and
cedars
listening
to
the
voice
of
the
wilderness
it
was
clean
out
there
listening
to
gloria
happy
voice
living
in
tune
with
the
springtime
thinking
a
man
thoughts
dreaming
a
man
dreams
doing
a
man
work
and
all
for
something
other
than
just
gold
at
the
end
of
it
but
the
emotion
like
a
vertigo
passed
as
swiftly
as
it
had
come
for
he
knew
within
himself
that
never
had
that
twisted
travesty
of
love
stirred
within
him
that
though
he
had
travelled
on
many
a
golden
trail
it
was
that
it
was
the
game
itself
that
counted
ever
with
him
and
no
such
poisonous
emotions
as
grew
within
the
wretched
breast
of
loony
honeycutt
and
these
golden
trails
though
inevitably
they
brought
him
trail
fellows
like
honeycutt
like
swen
brodie
were
none
the
less
paths
in
which
a
man
feet
might
tread
without
shame
and
in
which
the
mire
might
be
left
to
one
side
he
turned
back
to
the
room
honeycutt
was
near
the
bunk
groping
for
his
shotgun
he
started
guiltily
veiled
his
eyes
and
returned
to
the
table
if
it
was
all
in
gold
now
said
honeycutt
hurriedly
king
made
no
reference
to
honeycutt
murderous
intent
that
paper
is
the
same
thing
as
gold
he
said
the
government
backs
it
up
i
know
i
know
but
what
a
they
go
busted
do
they
sometimes
same
as
folks
gold
do
go
busted
there
ai
nothin
else
like
gold
you
can
tie
to
it
it
wo
burn
on
you
an
it
wo
rust
he
shook
his
head
stubbornly
there
ai
nothin
like
gold
if
that
was
all
in
gold
pieces
now
i
get
a
car
here
said
king
we
drive
down
to
auburn
and
take
a
train
to
san
francisco
and
there
i
undertake
to
get
you
the
whole
thing
in
gold
three
thousand
dollars
that
is
one
hundred
and
fifty
pieces
but
old
honeycutt
sucking
and
mouthing
shook
his
head
i
could
leave
here
an
you
know
it
i
i
got
things
here
he
said
with
a
look
of
great
cunning
i
would
go
away
from
not
if
horses
was
pullin
me
you
can
bring
those
things
along
honeycutt
cried
out
sharply
at
that
you
know
i
would
durst
with
the
world
full
of
robbers
that
would
be
after
me
like
hounds
runnin
down
a
rabbit
i
wo
go
you
make
me
no
man
cai
king
patience
deserted
him
i

not
going
to
make
you
do
anything
further

not
going
to
put

any
more
time
on
you
i
have
offered
to
pay
you
three
thousand
dollars
for
what

the
very
strong

a
bit
more
than
i
do
do
know
shrieked
honeycutt

i
a
boy
grown
when
the
dyin
delerious

stumbled
in
on
the
camp

i

old
dry

the
question

bleary
eyes
were
bright
with
cunning
if
i
do

nothin
jibed
honeycutt
what
you
askin
me
for
king
had
learned
little
that
he
did
not
already
know
he
came
back
to
the
table
and
began
gathering
up
the
money
wait
a
minute
mark
pleaded
the
old
man
restless
as
he
understood
that
the
glittering
coins
were
to
be
taken
away
let
talk
a
while
you
an
me
ai
had
a
good
chat
like
this
for
a
year
i
going
retorted
king
but
i
make
you
one
last
proposition
he
thrust
into
his
pocket
everything
excepting
five
gold
pieces
these
he
left
standing
in
a
little
pile
i
give
you
just
exactly
one
hundred
dollars
for
a
look
at
what
is
in
that
box
of
yours
in
sudden
alarm
the
old
man
shambled
back
to
his
bunk
his
hands
on
the
bedding
over
the
box
you
grab
it
an
run
he
clacked
you
rob
me
you
worse
than
brodie
you
know
better
than
that
king
told
him
sternly
if
i
wanted
to
rob
you
i
do
it
without
all
this
monkey
business
in
his
suspicious
old
heart
honeycutt
knew
that
he
battled
with
himself
his
toothless
old
mouth
tight
clamped
i
go
you
he
said
abruptly
stand
back
an
give
me
the
money
first
king
gave
him
the
money
and
drew
back
some
three
or
four
paces
honeycutt
drew
out
the
box
held
it
lingeringly
fought
his
battle
all
over
again
and
again
went
down
before
the
hundred
dollars
he
opened
the
box
upon
a
hinged
lid
he
made
a
smooth
place
in
the
covers
he
poured
out
the
contents
what
king
saw
three
articles
only
were
these
an
old
leather
pouch
bulging
probably
with
coins
a
parcel
and
a
burnished
gold
nugget
the
nugget
he
estimated
roughly
would
be
worth
five
hundred
dollars
were
it
all
that
it
looked
from
a
dozen
feet
away
the
parcel
since
it
was
enwrapped
in
a
piece
of
cloth
might
have
been
anything
it
was
shaped
like
a
flat
box
the
size
of
an
octavo
volume
honeycutt
leered
if
swen
brodie
had
of
knowed
what
he
had
right
in
his
hands
he
gloated
he
never
of
let
go
not
even
for
a
shotgun
at
his
head
brodie
has
gone
far
he
come
back
you
have
your
last
chance
to
talk
business
with
me
honeycutt
brodie
will
get
it
next
time
ho
will
he
not
where
i
goin
to
hide
it
mark
king
i
got
another
place
a
better
place
a
place
the
old
himself
find
king
left
him
gloating
and
placing
his
treasures
back
in
his
box
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
brodie
would
come
again
soon
it
began
to
look
as
though
brodie
had
the
bulge
on
the
situation
for
that
which
mark
king
could
not
come
at
by
fair
means
brodie
meant
to
have
by
foul
for
he
had
little
faith
in
the
new
but
on
a
knoll
where
she
sat
with
her
back
to
a
tree
was
gloria
he
turned
toward
her
she
waved
he
saw
that
brodie
and
two
men
with
him
were
looking
out
of
a
window
of
the
old
honeycutt
barn
he
heard
one
of
them
laughing
they
were
looking
at
gloria
king
quickened
his
step
to
come
to
her
his
blood
ruffled
by
a
new
anger
which
he
did
not
stop
to
reason
over
he
could
imagine
the
look
in
swen
brodie
evil
little
eyes
gloria
was
genuinely
glad
to
see
king
returning
to
her
she
came
to
meet
him
smiling
her
glad
welcome
it
seemed
that
you
were
gone
she
explained
i
never
saw
such
a
dreary
lonesome
place
as
this
sleepy
little
town
it
gives
me
the
fidgets
she
concluded
laughingly
these
old
mining
camps
have
atmospheres
all
their
own
he
admitted
understandingly
once
they
were
the
busiest
most
frantic
spots
of
the
whole
west
thousands
of
men
hurrying
up
and
down
all
full
of
great
big
golden
hopes
they
gone
but
i
sometimes
half
believe
their
ghosts
hang
on
the
air
is
full
of
that
sort
of
thing
a
dead
town
turned
into
a
ghost
town
it
gets
on
your
nerves
she
nodded
soberly
that
what
i
felt
though
i
did
reason
it
all
out
her
quick
smile
came
back
as
she
looked
up
into
his
face
and
confessed
my
it
good
to
have
you
back
come
he
said
we
go
and
have
lunch
you
no
idea
how
much
gayer
things
will
look
then
we
not
going
to
eat
she
announced
already
gay
i
stopped
in
at
a
little
funny
store
and
ordered
some
things
let
start
back
take
them
with
us
and
picnic
in
the
first
pretty
spot
out
of
sight
of
old
houses
as
side
by
side
they
went
along
through
the
sunshine
king
noted
how
brodie
and
a
couple
of
men
came
out
to
look
after
them
he
heard
the
low
sullen
bass
of
the
unforgettable
voice
saw
that
brodie
had
left
his
companions
and
was
going
straight
to
old
honeycutt
shanty
king
frowned
and
for
an
instant
hung
on
his
heel
drawing
gloria
curious
look
you
do
like
that
big
man
with
the
big
voice
said
gloria
no
he
said
tersely
it
is
swen
brodie
yes
but
how
do
you
know
oh
i
know
lots
of
things
people
do
think
i
know
all
girls
do
girls
are
rather
knowing
creatures
i
wonder
if
you
realize
that
i
do
know
much
about
girls
he
smiled
at
her
she
pondered
the
matter
for
a
dozen
steps
swinging
her
hat
at
her
side
and
looking
away
across
the
housetops
to
the
mountains
she
did
not
know
any
other
man
who
would
have
said
that
in
just
that
way
the
words
were
frank
all
sincerity
that
is
nothing
lay
behind
them
archie
and
teddy
any
of
her
boy
friends
in
town
they
knew
all
about
girls
or
thought
that
they
did
gratton
with
his
smooth
way
he
led
her
to
suppose
that
he
had
been
giving
girls
a
great
deal
of
studious
thought
for
many
years
and
that
only
after
this
thorough
investigation
did
he
feel
in
a
position
to
declare
herself
to
be
the
most
wonderful
of
her
sex
do
you
like
girls
she
asked
for
once
she
was
fishing
she
wanted
to
know
of
course
i
do
he
told
her
heartily
as
well
as
a
man
can
under
the
circumstances
you
mean
not
knowing
them
better
when
he
nodded
she
looked
up
at
him
again
hesitated
and
then
demanded
you
like
me
do
you
as
the
question
popped
out
she
understood
even
more
clearly
than
before
that
mark
king
was
utterly
different
from
her
various
men
friends
she
had
never
asked
a
man
that
before
she
was
not
accustomed
to
employing
either
that
direct
method
or
tone
just
now
there
was
no
hint
of
the
coquette
in
her
she
was
just
a
very
girl
as
serious
in
her
with
an
interesting
male
as
she
could
have
been
were
she
sixty
years
old
and
she
was
concerned
with
his
answer
already
she
knew
that
he
had
a
way
of
being
very
direct
and
straight
from
the
shoulder
of
course
i
do
he
said
heartily
a
little
surprised
by
the
abruptness
of
the
question
and
yet
without
hesitation
very
much
she
flushed
prettily
she
gloria
gaynor
flushed
up
because
mark
king
said
in
blunt
unvarnished
fashion
i
like
you
very
much
the
grave
sobriety
went
out
of
her
eyes
they
shone
happily
when
they
reached
the
funny
little
store
she
was
humming
a
snatch
of
a
bright
little
waltz
tune
and
she
was
thinking
without
putting
the
thought
into
words
and
i
like
you
very
much
you
are
quite
the
most
splendid
man
i
ever
saw
king
laughed
over
gloria
order
some
bars
of
sweetened
chocolate
a
bag
of
cookies
with
stale
frosting
in
pink
and
white
a
diminutive
tin
of
sardines
and
two
bottles
of
fine
he
chuckled
as
far
as
it
goes
now
we
complete
the
larder
a
small
handful
of
coffee
a
tin
of
condensed
milk
a
worth
of
sugar
can
of
corned
beef
block
of
butter
loaf
of
bread
two
tin
cups
your
marketing
he
grinned
at
her
we
have
for
dessert
i
did
know
countered
gloria
making
a
face
at
him
that
i
was
entertaining
a
starved
wild
man
for
lunch
you
eat
your
half
i
bet
and
be
ready
for
more
a
long
time
before
we
get
home
gloria
impatient
to
be
on
the
homeward
trail
assumed
command
in
a
way
which
delighted
king
he
glimpsed
the
fact
that
she
had
always
had
her
way
and
was
thoroughly
accustomed
to
the
issuance
of
orders
which
were
to
be
obeyed
further
he
found
her
little
way
of
princess
gloria
entirely
captivating
already
she
was
bullying
him
as
all
of
her
life
she
had
bullied
his
old
friend
ben
i
get
all
of
the
parcels
together
was
what
she
said
while
you
go
for
the
horses
and
you
hurry
wo
you
mark
on
the
run
your
majesty
he
laughed
when
he
had
saddled
and
returned
to
her
gloria
was
waiting
with
the
various
purchases
in
a
she
made
a
great
pretence
of
being
weighted
down
by
the
great
bulk
of
provisions
demanded
by
appetite
he
took
the
bag
from
her
lifted
her
into
her
saddle
and
they
rode
away
gloria
flicked
her
horse
lightly
with
her
whip
and
galloped
ahead
as
king
followed
he
turned
in
the
saddle
and
looked
back
toward
honeycutt
cabin
he
was
pulled
two
ways
by
the
girlish
figure
ahead
which
he
must
follow
since
it
was
his
responsibility
to
bring
her
back
to
his
friend
ben
by
what
he
fancied
happening
between
brodie
and
honeycutt
brodie
had
been
in
ugly
mood
all
along
he
would
be
in
uglier
mood
now
after
king
interruption
and
the
shotgun
episode
nor
could
king
forget
what
he
had
seen
on
lookout
ridge
if
swen
brodie
were
sure
enough
of
what
he
was
about
to
rid
himself
of
andy
parker
what
would
he
not
do
with
old
honeycutt
i
ought
to
go
back
was
what
king
said
over
and
over
to
himself
as
he
rode
steadily
on
after
gloria
the
last
roof
lost
to
sight
as
they
turned
into
the
mouth
of
a
cañon
he
shook
off
all
thought
of
returning
overtook
gloria
and
determined
to
forget
both
honeycutt
and
brodie
for
the
rest
of
the
day
would
be
another
day
there
are
hundreds
of
pretty
places
to
picnic
said
gloria
but
it
is
so
much
jollier
by
running
water
if
you
can
fight
down
that
hunger
of
yours
for
a
few
miles
he
told
her
i
show
you
the
prettiest
picnic
spot
you
ever
saw
and
one
by
the
way
that
precious
few
folks
know
about
it
tucked
away
as
if
the
mountains
had
the
notion
to
hide
it
from
all
invaders
she
was
immediately
all
eagerness
to
come
to
it
but
she
was
quick
to
see
that
though
king
laughed
with
her
he
retained
certain
serious
thoughts
of
his
own
thoughts
which
of
course
had
to
do
with
his
errand
she
wondered
what
had
happened
at
honeycutt
if
king
had
had
any
words
with
swen
brodie
she
had
been
wondering
that
ever
since
he
rejoined
her
under
the
tree
but
now
as
then
she
held
back
her
question
since
she
was
also
wondering
something
else
if
he
would
tell
her
without
being
asked
when
they
came
to
a
spring
freshet
which
they
had
crossed
this
morning
king
turned
off
to
the
right
riding
his
horse
hoofs
splashing
mightily
in
the
water
gloria
looking
on
ahead
saw
only
cañon
walls
on
either
hand
and
a
tangle
of
across
the
creek
come
on
called
king
keep
your
horse
right
in
the
water
and
in
two
shakes
i
show
you
my
hidden
place
you
are
going
to
like
it
though
she
was
little
impressed
by
what
she
could
see
she
followed
now
and
then
an
alder
brushed
against
her
once
king
waited
holding
back
a
green
barrier
which
he
had
thrust
to
one
side
the
shrubbery
thickened
in
five
minutes
she
could
catch
but
broken
glimpses
of
the
slopes
rising
to
right
and
left
their
horses
splashed
through
a
deep
pool
and
king
told
gloria
to
let
her
animal
have
his
head
so
that
he
could
pick
his
way
among
submerged
boulders
there
came
a
spot
where
the
banks
sloped
gently
again
and
here
he
rode
out
upon
a
bit
of
springy
sward
ringed
with
alder
and
willow
as
he
dismounted
gloria
looked
uncertainly
about
her
damp
underfoot
and
a
paradise
for
mosquitoes
was
her
thought
he
caught
her
look
and
laughed
we
get
down
here
and
leave
the
horses
he
informed
her
they
can
top
off
their
grain
and
hay
with
grass
while
we
dine
we
go
only
about
fifty
steps
further
but
we
go
on
foot
she
came
down
lightly
again
all
eager
curiosity
king
carrying
their
went
ahead
breaking
aside
the
shrubbery
for
gloria
close
at
his
heels
they
ploughed
through
what
looked
to
her
like
an
impenetrable
thicket
they
forded
the
stream
where
it
widened
out
placidly
stepping
on
boulders
always
king
went
ahead
holding
out
his
hand
to
her
once
she
slipped
but
before
her
boot
had
broken
the
surface
of
the
water
his
arm
was
about
her
he
caught
her
up
holding
her
an
instant
gloria
began
to
laugh
then
as
she
regarded
it
a
thoroughly
astonishing
thing
happened
she
felt
her
face
flushing
hotter
and
hotter
until
it
burned
she
laughed
again
a
trifle
uncertainly
and
jumped
unaided
to
the
next
boulder
and
across
to
the
pebbly
shallows
wading
out
through
six
inches
of
water
little
fool
she
chided
herself
hot
with
vexation
what
in
the
world
did
you
want
to
blush
like
that
for
he
will
think
you
are
about
ten
years
old
for
his
part
king
stood
a
moment
regarding
the
water
rushing
about
him
he
had
caught
her
to
save
her
from
falling
he
had
held
her
for
something
less
than
a
round
second
and
yet
something
of
her
pervaded
his
senses
it
had
been
a
second
fraught
with
intimacy
her
hair
had
blown
across
his
face
she
had
thrilled
through
him
like
a
sudden
burst
of
music
when
he
jerked
his
head
up
and
looked
at
her
he
could
not
see
her
face
she
was
very
busy
with
a
white
pebble
she
had
picked
up
he
jumped
across
to
land
and
went
on
and
the
incident
sank
away
into
silence
he
was
glad
to
come
to
what
he
called
the
door
to
the
hidden
place
he
opened
it
for
her
that
is
he
shoved
aside
a
mass
of
leaves
holding
the
branches
back
with
his
body
gloria
went
through
the
opening
thus
afforded
climbed
a
long
slanting
whitish
granite
slab
and
cried
out
ecstatically
at
the
beauty
of
the
spot
before
her
was
a
tiny
meadow
as
green
and
smooth
as
velvet
thick
with
white
and
yellow
violets
about
it
rimming
it
in
clean
lines
which
did
not
invade
the
sward
were
pines
and
beyond
the
pines
to
be
seen
in
broken
glimpses
among
their
sturdy
straight
trunks
were
the
cliffs
shutting
all
in
through
one
of
these
vistas
she
saw
a
white
waterfall
its
drops
of
spray
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
as
the
sun
caught
them
the
water
fell
into
a
green
pool
spilled
over
flowed
through
a
rock
channel
of
its
own
ancient
carving
and
curved
away
through
the
meadow
on
the
edge
of
this
granite
basin
with
showers
of
spray
breaking
over
it
a
little
bird
bobbed
and
dipped
and
lifting
its
head
with
its
own
inimitably
bright
gesture
broke
into
a
sweet
singing
as
liquidly
musical
as
the
falling
water
the
cried
gloria
see
i
remembered
his
name
and
he
is
here
to
welcome
us
under
the
pines
where
the
ground
was
dry
king
made
their
a
small
blaze
of
dry
twigs
between
two
flat
stones
gloria
was
every
bit
as
exultantly
delighted
with
the
moment
as
she
could
have
been
were
she
really
about
ten
years
old
i
want
to
help
what
can
i
do
tell
me
mark
what
can
i
do
oh
the
coffee
you
ca
make
coffee
without
water
can
you
she
caught
up
the
new
tin
and
ran
across
the
meadow
to
the
creek
the
little
bird
had
given
over
singing
and
watched
her
when
she
was
mindful
of
his
previous
rights
and
did
not
come
too
near
his
waterfall
he
gave
over
any
foolish
notion
he
may
have
had
of
flight
and
cocked
his
eye
again
at
the
pool
perhaps
the
put
him
in
mind
of
his
own
dinner
gloria
kneeling
at
her
task
watched
him
he
seemed
to
reflect
a
moment
then
with
a
sudden
flirt
and
flutter
he
had
broken
the
surface
of
the
water
and
was
gone
out
of
sight
she
gasped
he
had
gone
right
under
the
waterfall
a
little
bundle
of
feathers
no
bigger
than
her
clenched
hand
she
knelt
with
one
knee
getting
wet
and
never
knowing
it
she
began
to
feel
positive
that
the
hardy
headlong
little
fellow
surely
must
be
battered
to
death
and
drowned
then
with
the
abruptness
of
a
flash
of
light
there
he
was
again
on
the
surface
now
driving
himself
forward
toward
the
bank
and
there
he
sat
again
on
his
rock
the
water
flung
from
him
to
flash
and
mingle
with
the
falling
spray
his
head
back
his
throbbing
little
throat
pouring
out
his
fluent
melody
gloria
laughed
happily
and
went
back
to
king
and
the
fire
with
her
pot
of
water
i
love
this
said
gloria
softly
she
was
drinking
a
tin
cup
of
strong
cheap
coffee
cooled
with
condensed
milk
in
her
other
hand
was
a
thick
sandwich
of
bread
butter
and
corned
beef
king
laughed
what
he
demanded
what
particular
article
of
my
daintily
served
luncheon
has
made
the
great
hit
with
you
is
it
perhaps
the
rancid
butter
that
you
adore
you
know
i
love
this
her
look
embraced
the
universe
began
with
the
dying
fire
swept
on
beyond
the
against
the
deep
blue
of
sky
i
do
know
why
people
live
in
cities
with
all
of
this
shut
out
the
call
of
the
wild
he
spoke
lightly
and
yet
he
glimpsed
a
soul
really
stirred
saw
that
for
the
moment
if
for
no
longer
the
great
solitudes
held
her
enthralled
more
seriously
he
added
it
the
blood
of
your
ancestors
it
is
just
getting
a
chance
to
make
itself
heard
the
racket
of
market
street
drowns
it
out
she
nodded
thoughtfully
they
did
full
justice
to
their
lunch
finished
with
her
purchases
for
dessert
quite
as
he
had
prophesied
and
lazed
through
the
nooning
hour
gloria
lay
on
a
yielding
mat
of
her
eyes
grave
as
her
spirit
within
her
was
grave
moved
by
influences
at
once
vague
restless
and
tremendous
this
was
not
her
first
day
in
the
woods
and
yet
she
felt
strangely
that
it
was
he
had
spoken
of
her
ancestors
she
knew
little
of
her
mother
and
her
father
forbears
she
had
never
been
greatly
concerned
with
individuals
whom
she
had
never
known
in
a
way
she
had
been
led
to
think
by
her
own
mother
however
so
innocently
that
she
was
living
them
down
they
had
been
of
a
ruder
race
that
had
lived
in
a
ruder
day
in
san
francisco
to
miss
gloria
gaynor
in
a
pretty
new
gown
one
of
a
cluster
of
dainty
girls
those
grandparents
had
seemed
further
away
than
the
one
step
of
removal
between
them
and
her
nearer
blood
they
came
near
her
very
near
indeed
for
the
hour
that
she
lay
looking
up
at
the
sky
not
many
words
passed
between
her
and
king
he
sat
back
to
tree
and
smoked
his
pipe
and
was
quite
content
with
the
silence
she
started
out
of
a
reverie
to
find
king
standing
up
his
body
rigid
as
he
stood
in
the
attitude
of
one
who
listens
his
head
a
little
to
one
side
his
eyes
narrowed
wait
for
me
he
said
i
be
back
in
just
a
minute
she
sat
up
and
watched
him
he
went
back
to
the
sloping
granite
slab
over
it
down
among
the
alders
and
out
of
sight
for
a
moment
she
heard
him
among
the
bushes
then
as
all
sound
made
by
him
died
away
there
was
only
the
purl
of
the
creek
and
the
eternal
murmur
of
the
pines
now
it
seemed
to
her
more
silent
than
before
even
when
king
had
sat
wordlessly
near
her
and
yet
incongruously
whereas
the
silence
was
deepened
by
utter
solitude
the
voices
of
running
water
and
stirring
trees
rose
clearer
louder
more
insistent
a
falling
striking
all
but
noiselessly
at
her
side
made
her
turn
swiftly
only
now
did
she
hear
that
other
sound
which
king
had
detected
it
was
the
thud
of
horses
hoofs
with
it
came
men
voices
faintly
king
had
gone
that
way
gloria
stood
up
smothered
under
a
sense
of
aloneness
she
resented
his
going
she
was
on
the
verge
of
calling
to
him
her
heart
began
to
beat
faster
she
was
afraid
she
did
think
she
was
afraid
when
he
came
up
over
the
rock
again
gone
but
a
few
moments
true
to
his
word
she
ran
to
meet
him
she
had
not
been
afraid
but
engulfed
by
an
emotion
which
had
seemed
not
born
within
her
but
a
mighty
emanation
of
the
woods
themselves
and
which
in
its
effect
was
not
unlike
fear
an
emotion
which
now
that
king
was
here
was
lifted
out
of
her
and
blown
away
like
a
whiff
of
smoke
before
the
mountain
winds
she
looked
at
him
with
new
curiosity
wondering
at
herself
wondering
at
him
that
his
presence
or
absence
could
make
all
this
world
of
difference
she
saw
him
in
a
new
bright
light
as
one
may
see
for
the
first
time
a
stranger
on
whom
much
depends
he
was
strong
she
thought
strong
of
body
of
mind
of
heart
he
was
like
the
mountains
which
were
not
complete
without
him
his
eyes
were
frank
and
clear
and
honest
and
yet
they
were
for
her
filled
with
mystery
for
he
was
man
and
his
physical
manhood
was
splendidly
vigorously
vital
she
had
danced
with
men
and
boys
flirted
with
them
made
friends
of
a
sort
with
them
yet
none
of
them
had
set
her
wondering
as
king
did
the
repressed
curl
of
his
short
crisp
hair
the
warm
tan
of
his
face
and
hands
and
exposed
throat
the
very
gleam
of
his
perfect
teeth
and
the
flow
of
the
muscles
under
his
shirt
these
things
by
the
sheer
trick
of
opposites
sent
her
fancies
scurrying
to
gratton
how
unlike
the
two
men
were
and
how
glad
she
was
that
now
it
was
king
coming
up
over
the
rock
to
her
it
had
been
to
gratton
that
she
had
said
he
is
every
inch
a
man
she
stopped
abruptly
and
waited
for
him
to
come
to
her
side
we
must
be
going
he
said
you
have
rested
she
nodded
and
he
began
gathering
up
cups
scraps
of
paper
bits
of
food
he
left
for
bird
and
chipmunk
but
the
tin
cans
were
dropped
behind
an
old
log
and
covered
over
with
leaves
she
would
not
have
thought
of
that
she
understood
the
reason
and
was
glad
that
their
own
arrival
here
had
not
been
spoiled
for
them
by
finding
a
litter
of
other
campers
leavings
he
stamped
out
the
few
embers
of
their
fire
and
not
entirely
satisfied
though
there
was
but
little
danger
of
forest
fires
here
in
green
young
june
nevertheless
went
to
the
creek
for
water
and
doused
the
one
or
two
black
charred
sticks
which
still
emitted
thin
wisps
of
smoke
those
men
queried
gloria
when
it
was
clear
that
he
would
require
prompting
who
were
they
some
chaps
from
coloma
packing
off
into
the
woods
swen
brodie
she
demanded
yes
swen
brodie
and
half
a
dozen
of
his
ilk
we
will
overtake
them
is
that
why
you
are
in
a
hurry
now
no
we
wo
see
anything
of
them
that
what
i
went
to
find
out
we
are
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
fork
in
the
trail
they
turned
off
to
the
right
as
i
thought
they
would
you
would
like
to
follow
after
them
she
gathered
that
from
a
vague
something
in
his
voice
and
from
a
look
not
so
vague
in
his
eyes
if
i
were
not
along
you
would
go
the
way
they
have
gone
yes
he
admitted
but
you
are
along
you
know
what
is
more
as
he
realized
that
she
might
fear
he
resented
her
being
with
him
i
am
glad
that
you
are
and
now
shall
we
start
we
a
long
ride
ahead
of
us
yet
she
followed
him
down
through
the
alders
at
the
pool
where
she
had
slipped
before
and
he
had
held
her
in
his
arms
she
was
very
careful
not
to
slip
now
nor
did
they
look
at
each
other
while
she
lightly
touched
his
hand
and
they
crossed
over
for
an
hour
until
the
wilderness
worked
its
green
magic
upon
them
again
they
were
a
very
silent
man
and
girl
he
pondering
on
brodie
and
his
men
pushing
on
into
the
solitudes
she
wondering
many
things
about
her
companion
and
about
herself
through
the
long
shadows
of
evening
they
rode
back
to
the
log
house
while
king
unsaddled
gloria
stood
watching
him
her
eyes
shone
softly
through
the
dusk
it
has
been
a
truly
wonderful
day
she
said
simply
it
is
you
who
have
been
wonderful
he
answered
stoutly
i
know
you
are
not
used
to
long
rides
like
ours
i
know
you
are
tired
out
and
you
never
gave
a
sign
the
blood
of
my
ancestors
she
laughed
happily
in
the
house
gratton
looked
at
them
sharply
and
suspiciously
archie
and
teddy
saw
only
gloria
through
sorrowful
eyes
king
with
a
nod
to
the
various
guests
and
a
few
words
with
gaynor
entirely
given
to
warm
praise
of
her
daughter
drew
ben
aside
for
a
discussion
of
conditions
as
he
had
found
them
and
left
them
he
was
dead
sure
that
brodie
had
gone
back
to
honeycutt
had
gotten
what
he
wanted
and
was
off
in
a
to
put
to
the
proof
the
old
man
tale
gloria
was
off
to
bed
early
saying
everybody
rather
absently
she
climbed
up
the
stairs
wearily
when
her
mother
slipped
away
from
the
others
having
started
the
victrola
and
urged
them
to
dancing
she
found
gloria
ready
for
bed
but
standing
before
her
window
looking
out
at
the
first
stars
gaynor
discovered
in
her
little
daughter
a
new
uncommunicativeness
gloria
usually
had
so
many
bright
gushing
things
to
say
after
a
day
of
pleasure
but
she
appeared
oddly
preoccupied
oh
i
dead
tired
mamma
she
said
impatiently
nothing
happened
i
tell
you
anything
i
can
think
of
and
now
i
so
sleepy
she
kissed
her
mother
and
added
i
did
tell
mark
already
my
dear
he
was
outside
with
papa
said
gloria
slipping
into
bed
will
you
tell
him
for
me
he
gone
retorted
her
mother
with
a
certain
relish
gone
gloria
sat
up
a
very
pretty
picture
of
consternation
where
back
into
the
woods
where
he
came
from
of
course
i
actually
think
and
she
laughed
deprecatingly
though
with
a
shrewd
watchful
look
to
mark
her
daughter
quick
play
of
expression
that
that
man
could
sleep
two
consecutive
nights
under
a
roof
his
clothes
smell
like
a
he
would
understand
us
any
more
than
we
could
understand
him
i
suppose
gloria
was
silent
and
thoughtful
then
mamma
she
offered
again
her
cheek
snuggled
against
her
pillow
and
put
out
the
light
as
you
go
please
gaynor
accepting
her
dismissal
though
reluctantly
sighed
and
went
out
as
the
door
closed
gloria
tossed
back
the
covers
and
sprang
out
of
bed
going
again
to
her
window
she
watched
the
mountain
ridges
turn
blacker
and
blacker
saw
a
second
star
and
another
and
suddenly
the
heavens
filled
with
a
softly
glimmering
spray
of
twinkling
lights
she
heard
the
night
wind
rustling
tender
with
vague
voices
a
tiny
shiver
shook
the
white
shoulders
a
shiver
not
from
cold
since
not
yet
had
the
air
chilled
through
her
mind
swept
a
dozen
vivid
pictures
all
of
king
most
of
them
of
him
out
there
alone
with
the
night
and
the
mountains
but
she
saw
him
also
as
she
had
seen
him
riding
before
her
breaking
the
alders
aside
catching
her
as
she
fell
all
day
she
had
thrilled
to
him
now
more
than
ever
she
thrilled
she
imagined
she
saw
him
striding
along
through
the
big
boles
of
the
pines
passing
swiftly
silent
and
stern
through
a
faint
patch
of
light
standing
in
the
shadows
listening
his
keen
eyes
drilling
the
obscurity
passing
on
again
vigorous
forceful
determined
and
splendid
she
wondered
if
he
would
come
up
with
swen
brodie
most
of
all
she
wondered
when
she
would
see
him
again
in
all
likelihood
miss
gloria
healthy
tired
young
animal
would
have
slept
until
noon
next
day
had
she
been
left
to
her
own
devices
but
at
nine
her
mother
came
up
with
a
gloria
regarded
it
sleepily
i
would
have
let
you
sleep
my
dear
said
gaynor
but
there
are
your
guests
you
know
hang
my
guests
was
gloria
morning
greeting
just
because
i
invited
them
up
here
do
i
have
to
give
up
every
shred
of
my
independence
she
was
lying
in
identically
the
same
position
in
which
she
had
dropped
off
to
sleep
the
night
before
now
she
turned
and
emitted
a
sudden
ouch
not
only
was
she
stiff
from
head
to
foot
her
whole
body
ached
as
though
it
were
nothing
but
bruises
so
began
gloria
day
after
her
picnicking
with
mark
king
and
in
very
much
the
same
way
her
day
continued
long
before
the
sun
set
she
had
quarrelled
with
georgia
turned
up
her
nose
at
teddy
laughed
derisively
at
poor
archie
devotion
and
considerably
perplexed
and
worried
gratton
who
was
astute
enough
to
keep
tactfully
in
the
background
hurt
her
mother
feelings
and
alarmed
her
father
by
a
wild
and
for
the
instant
perfectly
heartfelt
determination
to
go
and
be
a
movie
actress
there
was
no
dancing
that
night
gloria
when
they
thought
her
upstairs
sat
alone
out
in
the
gloaming
a
wistful
drooping
little
girl
surrendering
sweepingly
to
youthful
melancholia
she
know
just
what
the
matter
was
she
did
seek
for
reasons
and
explanations
she
merely
stared
at
the
stars
which
swam
in
a
blue
blur
and
felt
miserable
but
morning
came
again
as
bright
as
that
first
day
in
eden
the
birds
sang
and
the
air
was
crisp
and
young
blood
ran
pleasantly
she
came
down
early
all
radiant
smiles
she
kissed
her
mother
on
both
cheeks
and
the
lips
rumpled
her
father
hair
affectionately
went
for
a
stroll
with
gratton
before
breakfast
craved
georgia
pardon
abjectly
and
made
the
world
an
of
joy
for
the
college
boys
gloria
was
mildly
surprised
that
gratton
did
not
appear
in
the
least
to
resent
her
day
of
adventuring
with
king
he
was
interested
he
did
shake
his
head
with
one
of
his
suave
smiles
and
murmur
lucky
dog
when
king
was
referred
to
but
his
interest
seemed
to
be
chiefly
in
that
quaint
little
relic
of
past
turbulent
days
coloma
he
had
her
tell
him
all
about
it
of
the
deserted
houses
the
store
everything
hence
his
curiosity
in
honeycutt
and
brodie
and
just
what
happened
between
king
and
them
did
not
stand
out
alone
and
made
no
impression
on
gloria
long
ago
gratton
had
had
from
her
lips
what
rumours
had
been
repeated
by
her
father
to
her
mother
and
then
relayed
on
to
her
own
ears
down
in
san
francisco
busied
with
her
own
youthful
joys
this
quest
of
ben
gaynor
and
mark
king
had
had
no
serious
import
to
the
girl
she
had
merely
chatted
of
it
because
of
its
colourful
phases
naturally
had
she
thought
a
great
deal
of
it
she
would
have
supposed
that
gratton
in
nowise
concerned
was
even
more
superficially
interested
than
herself
by
the
end
of
the
week
her
guests
began
taking
their
leaves
georgia
and
connie
grayson
were
off
to
foregather
with
a
crowd
of
friends
at
the
lake
tahoe
tavern
evelyn
returned
to
her
mother
in
oakland
archie
departed
importantly
to
aid
his
father
in
the
business
teddy
went
away
regretfully
even
gratton
having
lingered
longest
of
all
went
back
to
his
city
affairs
promising
to
run
up
again
when
he
could
prophesying
smilingly
that
he
would
see
both
gloria
and
her
mother
in
town
within
ten
days
ben
leaving
his
oldest
and
most
dependable
to
look
out
for
the
womenfolk
hastened
back
to
the
where
he
returned
like
a
fish
to
water
to
his
old
pipe
and
old
clothes
and
roomy
boots
and
gloria
was
plunged
deep
into
loneliness
she
would
walk
up
the
creek
back
of
the
house
sit
by
the
hour
near
the
pool
where
the
water
came
slithering
down
over
a
green
and
grey
boulder
watching
for
the
entertained
in
an
absent
sort
of
way
by
his
bobbings
and
flirtings
and
snatches
of
song
she
dreamed
she
started
expectantly
every
time
a
chipmunk
made
a
scurrying
racket
in
dead
leaves
she
made
a
hundred
romantic
conclusions
to
the
story
just
begun
by
mark
king
going
in
the
night
into
the
mountains
where
brodie
was
her
mind
was
rife
with
speculation
having
ample
food
for
thought
in
all
the
information
she
had
extracted
from
her
father
thus
she
knew
of
andy
parker
death
of
old
honeycutt
box
of
boastings
of
a
wild
youth
of
brodie
threats
and
king
interference
and
the
old
man
shotgun
if
she
could
only
what
was
happening
now
out
there
beyond
those
silent
blue
barriers
night
after
night
she
stood
at
her
window
swayed
through
many
swift
moods
by
her
live
fancies
she
grew
wildly
homesick
for
town
a
theatre
dance
a
ride
through
the
park
activity
and
people
it
was
for
her
mother
that
she
consented
to
remain
here
another
week
gaynor
declared
that
she
must
have
a
few
more
days
of
rest
she
was
worn
out
from
a
year
of
going
eternally
entertaining
or
being
entertained
gloria
yielding
plunged
into
an
orgy
of
she
answered
letters
weeks
old
she
scribbled
countless
bright
and
unnecessary
notes
also
she
succeeded
in
getting
her
mother
to
drive
with
her
frequently
to
tahoe
to
call
on
those
of
their
friends
there
who
had
come
to
the
mountains
so
early
in
the
season
several
times
they
remained
overnight
at
the
tavern
it
was
after
one
of
these
absences
that
jim
spalding
the
old
told
gaynor
in
his
abashed
stammer
that
mark
king
had
showed
up
while
they
were
gone
gloria
on
her
way
to
her
room
whirled
and
came
back
and
extracted
the
tale
in
its
entirety
pumping
it
out
of
the
brief
old
spalding
in
jerky
details
king
had
appeared
late
yesterday
afternoon
coming
out
of
the
woods
looked
like
he
been
roughin
it
an
goin
it
hard
at
that
had
told
jim
he
wanted
to
telephone
had
stuck
around
for
a
while
gettin
his
call
through
had
eaten
supper
with
jim
had
gone
back
into
the
woods
just
about
dark
that
was
all
jim
knowed
about
it
rather
that
was
all
that
he
supposed
he
knew
until
miss
gloria
was
done
with
him
she
dragged
other
bits
of
information
to
the
surface
king
had
phoned
her
father
they
had
talked
ten
minutes
gaynor
was
to
telephone
to
the
log
house
again
or
next
day
there
would
be
a
message
for
king
mos
likely
from
coloma
king
wanted
to
know
something
ben
was
to
find
out
king
would
turn
up
within
a
few
days
for
the
message
gaynor
that
same
day
said
to
her
daughter
in
a
way
so
casual
that
gloria
immediately
was
on
the
alert
you
been
very
sweet
to
stay
up
here
in
this
lonely
place
with
me
dear
i
am
ready
to
go
at
any
time
now
shall
we
go
mother
thinks
she
is
so
deep
was
gloria
unspoken
comment
we
such
a
lot
of
packing
to
do
said
gloria
with
an
assumption
of
carelessness
far
more
artistic
than
her
mother
and
i
as
sleepy
and
lazy
as
an
owl
after
being
up
so
late
last
night
her
yawn
softly
patted
by
four
fingers
was
as
ingenuous
as
a
kitten
i
really
in
no
hurry
mamma
if
we
ready
or
next
day
they
were
still
in
the
log
house
when
hours
later
the
telephone
rang
and
gloria
quick
to
forestall
her
mother
heard
the
operator
saying
coloma
calling
ben
gaynor
residence
coloma
thought
gloria
with
a
quickened
heartbeat
then
it
would
be
her
father
after
all
it
would
be
mark
king
but
her
father
it
was
and
she
was
disappointed
the
message
however
was
for
king
mark
will
show
up
in
a
day
or
so
he
said
tell
him
that
i
did
as
he
asked
that
brodie
is
in
and
out
from
here
the
lord
knows
what
about
that
old
honeycutt
boasts
that
what
he
has
hidden
nobody
is
going
to
find
i
think
if
he
ever
talks
to
anybody
it
will
be
to
me
and
i
run
in
and
see
him
whenever
i
get
a
chance
to
get
over
here
and
tell
king
that
that
oh
i
guess
that
all
better
let
me
have
a
word
with
your
mother
ben
gaynor
was
never
the
man
for
successful
subterfuge
especially
with
his
daughter
she
could
read
every
look
in
his
eye
every
twitch
of
his
mouth
and
now
over
many
miles
of
country
telephone
lines
she
knew
that
her
beloved
old
humbug
of
a
male
parent
was
holding
out
on
her
her
first
impulse
was
to
face
him
down
and
demand
to
be
told
the
rest
but
realizing
that
a
father
at
the
end
of
a
line
was
possessed
of
a
certain
strategic
advantage
presenting
more
difficulties
than
a
mother
at
hand
she
said
lightly
all
right
papa
i
call
her
be
sure
you
take
good
care
of
yourself
bydie
she
relinquished
the
telephone
instrument
to
her
mother
and
stood
waiting
she
could
hear
the
buzzing
of
her
father
voice
but
no
distinct
word
her
mother
said
yes
and
yes
and
yes
ben
and
then
oh
i
do
understand
and
then
her
mother
voice
sharpened
and
she
cut
into
something
gaynor
was
saying
i
ca
say
anything
like
it
is
as
though
we
suspected
him
of
being
underhanded
and
such
scraps
of
talk
were
baffling
and
gloria
with
scant
patience
for
the
baffling
moved
up
and
down
restlessly
when
her
mother
had
clicked
up
the
receiver
gloria
followed
her
and
demanded
to
be
told
gaynor
looked
worried
said
it
was
nothing
and
refused
to
talk
but
in
five
minutes
her
daughter
knew
everything
gaynor
had
said
king
was
to
be
told
that
gratton
instead
of
going
straight
to
san
francisco
had
gone
down
to
placerville
and
next
had
turned
up
at
coloma
that
he
had
spent
three
days
there
that
he
had
gone
several
times
to
shanty
and
had
been
seen
more
than
once
with
swen
brodie
it
an
outrage
cried
gaynor
to
retail
all
that
to
mark
king
what
business
of
his
is
it
if
gratton
does
go
to
coloma
or
anywhere
else
that
for
you
and
papa
to
argue
out
said
gloria
serenely
we
are
going
back
to
san
francisco
i
not
you
know
i
not
ready
to
go
yet
that
is
very
undutiful
gloria
said
her
mother
anxiously
when
your
own
mother
oh
let
not
get
tragic
and
anyway
papa
wanted
us
to
stay
until
king
came
so
that
we
could
tell
him
jim
spalding
will
be
here
he
can
tell
why
mamma
after
papa
has
trusted
to
to
see
that
his
message
is
delivered
gloria
looked
shocked
incredulous
surely
so
they
waited
for
mark
king
to
come
again
out
of
the
forest
all
the
next
day
gloria
dressed
very
daintily
and
looking
so
lovely
in
her
expectancy
that
even
old
jim
spalding
eyes
followed
her
everywhere
watched
from
the
porch
or
a
window
or
her
place
by
the
creek
she
was
sure
that
he
would
step
out
of
the
shadows
into
the
sun
with
that
familiar
appearance
of
having
just
materialized
from
among
the
tree
trunks
over
and
over
she
was
prepared
with
prettily
simulated
surprise
to
greet
his
coming
but
the
day
passed
night
drove
them
indoors
to
a
cosy
fireplace
and
lights
and
fragments
of
music
which
gloria
played
wistfully
or
crashingly
in
bursts
of
impatience
and
still
he
did
not
come
gaynor
went
off
to
bed
at
nine
gloria
suddenly
absorbed
in
a
book
elected
to
sit
up
and
finish
her
chapter
she
outwatched
the
log
fire
at
eleven
the
air
was
chill
and
gloria
as
she
went
upstairs
shivered
a
little
and
felt
tired
and
vaguely
sad
the
next
day
she
put
on
another
pretty
dress
did
her
hair
in
her
favourite
way
and
went
about
the
house
as
gay
as
a
lark
the
day
dragged
by
king
did
not
come
by
nightfall
the
look
in
gloria
eyes
had
altered
and
a
stubborn
expression
played
havoc
with
the
tenderer
curves
of
her
mouth
she
resented
at
this
late
date
king
way
of
going
not
only
had
he
not
told
her
he
had
left
no
word
with
her
father
for
her
she
sat
smiling
over
a
letter
received
some
days
ago
from
gratton
after
she
had
retrieved
the
letter
from
a
heap
of
crumpled
papers
in
her
bedroom
basket
she
read
to
her
mother
fragments
bright
gossipy
remarks
in
gratton
clever
way
of
saying
them
she
wrote
a
long
dashingly
composed
answer
two
days
later
she
said
to
her
mother
out
of
a
long
silence
over
the
coffee
cups
let
go
back
to
san
francisco
this
stupid
place
gets
on
my
nerves
why
of
course
dear
agreed
gaynor
i
can
have
everything
packed
this
afternoon
and
nonsense
said
gloria
you
know
we
can
get
packed
in
half
an
hour
that
day
they
left
jim
spalding
in
charge
and
departed
for
truckee
to
catch
a
train
for
san
francisco
gaynor
dutifully
entrusted
to
spalding
her
husband
message
for
mark
king
that
is
to
say
that
portion
of
the
message
which
she
considered
important
gloria
herself
left
no
message
with
old
jim
not
in
so
many
words
but
she
did
impress
him
with
her
abundant
gaiety
with
her
eagerness
for
san
francisco
where
all
of
her
best
and
dearest
friends
were
if
any
one
should
ask
old
jim
concerning
miss
gloria
jim
would
be
sure
to
make
it
clear
that
she
had
no
minutest
regret
in
going
but
a
very
lively
anticipation
of
the
fullest
happiness
elsewhere
three
or
four
weeks
passed
before
mark
king
and
gloria
met
again
weeks
of
busy
gaiety
on
her
part
of
steady
persistent
seeking
on
his
now
again
gloria
and
her
mother
and
ben
were
at
the
log
house
in
the
mountains
this
time
with
a
fresh
set
of
guests
only
one
of
the
former
flock
had
been
invited
gratton
and
this
despite
ben
uneasy
this
chap
gratton
nellie
he
cutting
in
pretty
strong
here
of
late
and
i
do
know
that
i
like
him
he
too
confounded
smooth
somehow
king
came
the
day
after
the
guests
arrived
for
a
talk
with
ben
gloria
knew
that
he
was
coming
and
was
coolly
prepared
to
meet
him
she
gave
him
a
bright
little
nod
friendly
enough
but
casual
and
resumed
her
lively
chatter
with
her
friends
king
went
off
with
gaynor
that
night
there
was
no
moon
but
the
stars
those
great
glittering
stars
of
the
sierra
made
the
hour
softly
palpitant
king
betook
himself
to
smoke
upon
that
particular
remembered
corner
of
the
porch
gloria
slipping
out
from
a
dance
felt
the
little
thrill
that
would
not
down
when
she
found
him
there
in
their
two
chairs
necessarily
close
together
since
the
nook
was
so
cosily
narrow
her
shoulder
now
and
then
brushing
his
as
she
moved
the
faint
fragrances
from
her
gown
and
hair
blown
across
his
face
by
the
night
breeze
for
them
his
pipe
hastily
laid
aside
they
sat
talking
softly
or
in
a
pleasant
silence
the
next
morning
the
matter
seemed
to
arrange
itself
with
very
little
help
from
either
they
were
to
have
a
ride
together
this
time
they
would
take
their
lunch
when
they
said
gloria
impulsively
gave
him
her
two
hands
he
remembered
how
she
had
done
that
the
first
time
he
had
seen
her
her
face
was
lifted
up
to
his
in
the
starlight
he
saw
her
eyes
shining
softly
gloriously
he
saw
her
mouth
the
lips
barely
apart
for
an
instant
his
hands
shut
down
hard
on
hers
he
felt
the
faint
pressure
of
her
own
in
return
when
they
heard
her
mother
in
the
doorway
calling
gloria
where
are
you
they
started
apart
a
strange
and
unanalysed
sense
of
secrecy
had
fallen
upon
them
gloria
whispered
mark
and
then
calling
here
i
am
mamma
just
cooling
off
she
went
skipping
down
the
porch
slipped
her
arm
about
her
mother
and
carried
her
back
into
the
house
before
the
new
day
was
fairly
come
they
met
in
the
fringe
of
pines
again
they
shook
hands
again
for
an
instant
they
stood
as
they
had
stood
last
night
they
were
tremblingly
close
to
the
first
kiss
suddenly
gloria
with
her
colour
high
and
her
eyes
hidden
under
lashes
which
king
marvelled
at
lashes
laid
tenderly
against
her
cheeks
pulled
her
hands
out
of
his
and
began
drawing
on
her
gauntlets
gravely
as
though
here
were
a
rite
to
be
approached
solemnly
he
lifted
her
into
the
saddle
they
turned
their
horses
and
rode
up
the
ridge
among
the
trees
they
heard
together
the
first
sleepy
twitterings
of
hidden
birds
they
saw
the
black
shadows
thinning
they
watched
the
light
come
upon
the
peaks
ridges
shook
off
the
shadow
cloaks
seemed
to
quiver
as
they
awoke
to
the
new
day
grew
flushed
and
rosy
the
chill
of
the
early
morning
air
was
like
wine
sparkling
tingling
in
the
blood
the
smell
of
resinous
woods
was
insistent
the
fine
bouquet
to
the
rare
vintage
the
day
the
world
themselves
all
were
young
together
all
awakening
to
the
full
true
and
triumphant
meaning
of
life
they
rode
a
mile
with
never
a
spoken
word
but
in
a
communion
then
it
was
gloria
who
spoke
first
saying
as
she
had
said
once
before
i
love
it
they
followed
narrow
trails
through
the
riding
one
behind
the
other
they
climbed
steep
trails
among
the
pines
then
went
down
steep
trails
among
granite
boulders
they
rode
side
by
side
through
little
upland
valleys
and
grassy
meadows
they
broke
off
sprays
of
resinous
needles
as
they
rode
inhaling
the
sharp
odours
they
stooped
for
handfuls
of
fragrant
sage
they
splashed
through
swampy
places
where
the
grass
and
stalks
of
lush
flowers
swept
their
stirrups
through
noisy
streams
where
they
must
pick
their
way
cautiously
and
where
the
horses
snorted
and
shook
their
heads
and
gloria
laughed
gleefully
was
like
the
completion
of
that
other
day
when
they
had
ridden
to
coloma
to
both
it
seemed
that
it
was
only
yesterday
the
weeks
in
between
did
not
matter
they
were
wiped
out
of
life
by
the
green
magic
unfinished
topics
left
over
from
the
first
ride
presented
themselves
now
to
be
completed
once
gloria
speaking
of
their
first
woodland
luncheon
said
yesterday
once
king
as
they
crossed
a
wild
mountain
brook
said
there
one
nest
now
on
that
rock
down
by
the
waterfall
looks
like
a
bit
of
the
rock
itself
with
moss
all
about
it
and
gloria
understood
that
it
was
her
he
was
talking
about
it
was
springtime
yesterday
and
it
summer
said
gloria
it
always
springtime
somewhere
in
the
world
answered
king
we
ride
from
one
season
up
into
the
other
more
magic
laughed
gloria
it
is
always
springtime
somewhere
in
the
world
as
youth
knows
and
remembers
as
age
forgets
always
a
place
somewhere
for
laughter
and
love
and
light
hands
caressing
for
bird
song
and
bird
mating
and
colourful
flowers
and
they
were
seeking
this
place
among
the
mountains
riding
on
expectantly
through
dark
passes
climbing
winding
trails
looking
across
deep
cañons
and
blue
ridges
gloria
thought
dreamily
that
she
would
like
always
to
be
riding
thus
leaving
summer
behind
and
below
questing
the
joyous
springtime
he
had
promised
to
show
her
his
latest
temporary
camp
they
came
to
it
before
noon
at
an
altitude
of
well
above
seven
thousand
feet
in
a
grassy
open
space
they
left
their
horses
king
carried
their
lunch
bundle
and
they
went
on
on
foot
along
the
frothing
creek
along
the
through
a
wild
country
of
dwarfed
vegetation
she
began
to
understand
a
thing
he
had
told
her
that
the
sierra
is
the
land
of
dwarf
and
giant
pine
and
cedar
and
in
one
spot
he
knew
mighty
sequoia
piercing
at
the
sky
and
here
pine
dwarfed
pygmied
until
it
was
but
a
mat
of
twisted
broken
twigs
carpeting
the
heights
and
i
have
walked
among
the
pine
tops
cried
gloria
for
up
here
there
was
scant
soil
here
the
winds
raged
and
the
snow
heaped
itself
high
in
the
late
fall
and
remained
into
late
summer
and
here
now
the
springtime
had
just
come
never
had
gloria
seen
more
beautiful
flowers
flowers
half
so
and
yet
how
hardy
they
must
be
to
live
here
at
all
you
are
like
these
flowers
king
said
quite
gravely
and
with
sincerity
gloria
told
him
also
gravely
and
sincerely
that
that
was
the
finest
compliment
she
had
ever
received
she
hoped
that
he
meant
it
at
least
she
understood
and
she
would
like
to
be
like
them
his
camp
was
in
a
little
nearly
level
spot
sheltered
by
crags
and
so
hidden
by
them
that
one
must
come
fairly
upon
it
before
guessing
its
proximity
back
of
it
rose
cliffs
so
sheer
that
gloria
craned
her
neck
to
look
up
at
them
below
were
the
headwaters
of
the
creek
across
it
the
steep
slope
of
the
other
cañon
wall
on
all
hands
bleak
naked
rock
with
tiny
blossoms
here
and
there
between
in
the
shallow
soil
and
the
carpeting
of
pygmy
pine
and
flattened
cedar
only
infrequently
did
a
tree
with
roots
gripping
like
claws
lift
its
ragged
top
above
the
big
boulders
a
wild
place
savagely
silent
save
for
the
hissing
of
the
wind
around
the
cliffs
above
king
brought
water
from
the
creek
he
showed
her
where
he
had
hidden
his
few
camp
utensils
the
one
small
pot
one
one
cup
one
spoon
to
these
he
added
his
he
made
a
fire
where
already
there
was
a
little
heap
of
charred
coals
against
a
blackened
rock
and
they
made
coffee
and
cooked
bacon
gloria
used
a
stick
which
he
had
pointed
for
her
to
turn
the
bacon
they
took
turns
with
the
one
cup
what
was
it
like
up
on
the
cliff
tops
king
did
not
know
he
had
not
yet
been
up
there
and
would
it
take
long
to
climb
them
not
over
an
hour
he
estimated
if
she
was
tired
it
was
decided
that
king
would
have
his
postprandial
smoke
up
there
where
they
could
sit
and
look
out
across
the
top
of
the
world
as
they
climbed
they
came
into
a
current
of
rushing
air
higher
up
the
wind
strengthened
they
stood
poised
on
boulders
their
shoulders
thrown
back
heads
up
lungs
filling
gloria
hair
was
whipped
out
from
under
her
turban
it
blew
across
her
face
a
strand
of
it
fluttered
across
king
eyes
brushed
his
lips
he
gave
her
his
hand
up
a
steep
place
down
which
they
sent
a
cascade
of
disintegrating
stone
they
stood
side
by
side
shoulders
brushing
resting
breathing
deeply
perceptibly
the
air
thinned
one
lungs
were
taxed
to
capacity
here
the
blood
clamoured
for
deeper
drafts
for
more
oxygen
when
they
came
to
the
top
gloria
dropped
down
panting
though
they
had
stopped
many
times
on
the
way
she
closed
her
eyes
and
her
senses
swam
through
a
vast
blur
king
gave
her
a
drink
from
his
canteen
she
merely
thanked
him
with
her
eyes
but
in
ten
minutes
she
had
rested
and
was
on
her
feet
her
slim
body
leaning
against
the
wind
he
stood
by
her
and
they
looked
out
across
the
mountains
for
what
seemed
to
gloria
a
thousand
miles
there
was
the
broken
wilderness
of
mountains
gashed
with
gorges
crowned
with
peaks
painted
with
sunlight
and
distance
glinting
white
here
veiled
in
purple
there
she
gasped
at
the
bigness
of
it
it
spoke
of
the
vastness
of
the
world
and
of
the
world
primitive
savagery
and
yet
it
did
not
repel
it
fascinated
and
its
message
had
the
seeming
of
an
old
and
tale
it
threatened
with
its
spires
as
cruel
as
bared
fangs
and
yet
it
beckoned
and
invited
with
its
blue
distances
always
since
the
first
man
fashioned
the
first
club
and
made
him
a
knife
of
a
jagged
flint
has
mankind
battled
with
the
great
mother
the
earth
who
bore
him
he
has
striven
with
her
for
his
food
warred
with
her
for
his
raiment
entrenched
himself
against
the
merciless
attack
of
the
seasons
winter
to
stab
him
with
icy
spear
summer
to
consume
him
and
always
has
he
loved
her
and
honoured
her
since
she
is
his
great
mother
gloria
her
thoughts
confused
by
conflicting
instincts
inspired
and
awed
drew
closer
to
but
to
be
out
here
alone
the
utter
utter
loneliness
of
it
she
looked
at
him
with
new
curious
eyes
does
it
bear
down
on
you
do
you
feel
at
times
that
the
loneliness
he
understood
i
am
used
to
it
you
know
i
have
never
known
what
it
was
out
here
to
feel
lonely
until
she
waited
for
him
to
finish
her
eyes
on
his
until
until
after
our
first
ride
together
he
said
again
she
understood
and
now
she
looked
away
hastily
and
her
cheeks
reddened
he
was
about
to
tell
her
that
he
loved
her
his
eyes
had
told
her
his
lips
were
shaping
to
the
words
i
love
you
and
she
was
suddenly
conscious
of
a
wild
nutter
in
her
heart
she
was
trembling
as
though
terrified
other
men
had
told
her
i
love
you
many
times
and
in
many
ways
smiling
with
a
laugh
with
a
sigh
whispering
the
words
or
saying
them
half
sternly
and
she
had
always
been
gay
and
ready
a
little
thrilled
perhaps
as
by
a
chance
strain
of
music
but
now
she
could
hardly
breathe
now
she
was
frightened
she
did
not
know
why
she
could
not
understand
the
sense
of
it
she
only
knew
that
she
was
afraid
of
what
nor
did
she
know
that
she
only
knew
that
here
were
gloria
gaynor
and
mark
king
man
and
girl
man
and
woman
set
apart
from
the
world
lifted
above
it
figures
upon
a
pinnacle
piercing
the
infinite
blue
of
the
heavens
and
that
a
mystery
was
unfolding
before
them
she
had
a
wild
wish
to
stop
the
flight
of
time
to
thrust
it
back
upon
itself
to
have
the
present
not
the
present
but
to
avoid
the
now
by
racing
back
into
the
serenity
of
just
a
little
while
ago
ten
minutes
ago
anything
but
this
electric
terrifying
moment
when
mark
king
a
surge
of
emotion
upon
him
was
about
to
say
i
love
you
look
gloria
started
and
forgetful
of
the
strange
conflict
of
emotions
within
her
clutched
at
his
sleeve
a
man
here
swen
brodie
muttered
king
angrily
brodie
had
just
clambered
up
the
ridge
and
came
into
view
only
when
his
head
and
bulky
shoulders
were
upthrust
beyond
a
boulder
he
came
on
until
he
topped
the
boulder
standing
fully
revealed
upon
its
flattish
top
the
butt
of
his
rifle
resting
on
his
boot
gloria
was
suddenly
afraid
with
a
new
sort
of
fear
though
this
man
was
not
near
enough
for
her
to
see
the
dancing
evil
of
his
little
eyes
she
saw
the
brutish
face
in
full
relief
against
the
sky
and
marked
the
jeer
on
the
ugly
mouth
her
one
wild
thought
was
that
brodie
would
murder
them
both
shoot
them
both
down
in
cold
blood
she
shuddered
king
was
unarmed
brodie
hated
king
as
only
a
man
of
brodie
kind
bestial
and
cruel
could
hate
she
remembered
what
her
father
had
told
her
of
the
death
of
andy
parker
she
began
tugging
at
king
take
me
away
she
gasped
and
then
with
a
terrified
look
over
her
shoulder
oh
he
is
terrible
perhaps
brodie
heard
the
stiff
wind
blew
her
words
away
from
her
lips
tossing
them
toward
him
steady
gloria
said
king
in
a
low
voice
i
take
you
away
but
we
need
hurry
he
wo
hurt
you
and
to
further
soothe
her
he
added
he
be
afraid
to
shoot
were
he
minded
to
the
noise
of
the
gun
you
know
and
he
does
know
how
many
there
are
with
us
or
how
close
they
are
come
we
go
this
way
he
turned
his
back
square
on
brodie
and
with
his
hand
firm
on
arm
led
her
along
the
ridge
they
passed
about
a
rock
and
gloria
looked
back
hoping
that
it
had
hidden
them
already
from
brodie
she
saw
his
head
over
the
top
of
it
felt
upon
her
the
eyes
which
she
could
not
see
lost
as
they
were
under
his
and
hurried
on
she
ran
ahead
now
with
king
hastening
his
step
to
overtake
her
that
night
when
king
and
gloria
said
an
odd
constraint
lay
over
them
to
gloria
king
seemed
stiff
and
preoccupied
she
herself
had
red
spots
in
her
cheeks
and
was
nervously
tense
the
abrupt
approach
of
brodie
with
his
repulsive
face
at
a
moment
when
the
world
swirled
away
from
her
underfoot
and
a
divine
madness
was
in
her
blood
the
reaction
and
revulsion
all
this
and
the
resultant
conflict
of
emotions
had
worn
her
out
she
was
sure
of
nothing
in
all
the
world
for
once
was
not
in
the
least
certain
of
herself
when
she
drew
her
hand
out
of
king
and
hastened
to
her
guests
in
the
house
it
was
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
she
heard
the
door
close
shutting
her
in
with
familiar
homey
objects
and
faces
opposing
its
barrier
against
the
wilderness
and
a
man
who
was
a
part
of
the
wilderness
she
knew
that
king
was
going
back
to
the
mountains
she
knew
when
he
left
going
swiftly
and
silently
like
a
shadow
among
shadows
she
knew
that
this
time
he
went
armed
carrying
her
father
rifle
for
mark
king
knew
that
it
was
inevitable
that
his
path
and
swen
brodie
should
run
closer
and
closer
that
trails
made
by
two
men
like
king
and
brodie
could
never
converge
harmoniously
that
there
was
too
much
at
stake
that
it
was
well
to
be
ready
for
brodie
in
an
ugly
mood
in
an
encounter
so
far
removed
from
the
habitations
of
men
that
a
deed
done
would
pass
without
human
commentary
a
week
passed
and
gloria
went
back
to
san
francisco
these
had
been
seven
days
and
nights
of
uncertainty
for
her
and
had
brought
hours
of
confusion
that
mounted
into
bewilderment
she
had
sung
and
danced
and
flirted
as
even
gloria
gaynor
had
never
done
before
she
had
made
gratton
sure
of
her
and
his
eyes
had
smouldered
and
his
chalky
pale
face
had
flushed
she
had
sent
him
off
gnawing
at
his
nails
she
had
made
other
young
laughter
rise
like
echoes
of
her
own
she
had
sighed
and
sat
long
hours
at
her
window
wondering
wondering
wondering
in
the
end
she
had
gone
leaving
her
little
note
for
mark
king
king
did
not
return
to
the
log
house
he
knew
that
long
ago
gloria
would
have
gone
there
was
nothing
to
draw
him
in
her
absence
he
kept
in
touch
none
too
close
with
ben
gaynor
telephoned
him
once
from
coloma
and
once
sent
a
note
to
him
by
a
hunter
he
encountered
on
five
lakes
creek
above
hell
hole
the
note
to
be
mailed
in
truckee
some
time
later
and
to
reach
gaynor
the
following
day
at
his
these
were
strenuous
days
during
which
king
penetrated
the
most
corners
of
the
mountains
he
constructed
his
theories
and
strove
doggedly
to
set
them
to
the
proof
he
held
that
when
baldy
winch
had
made
him
a
cabin
in
so
inaccessible
and
distant
a
spot
as
the
crest
of
lookout
ridge
it
had
been
because
winch
the
sole
survivor
of
those
hardy
spirits
who
had
been
of
gus
ingle
party
was
of
a
mind
to
make
sure
day
after
day
that
no
other
men
went
where
he
had
been
perhaps
he
knew
that
he
alone
remained
alive
that
the
secret
was
his
that
he
had
but
to
wait
the
winter
out
to
sit
through
the
spring
thaw
and
then
go
back
to
claim
his
own
a
man
like
baldy
winch
as
king
envisioned
him
would
do
that
hence
from
lookout
ridge
one
should
be
able
to
see
the
very
point
or
a
peak
standing
over
the
very
point
where
gus
ingle
men
had
gone
but
always
the
one
difficulty
that
point
might
be
a
mile
away
or
ten
twenty
thirty
miles
away
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
seek
and
he
knew
that
always
swen
brodie
too
was
seeking
brodie
and
the
men
of
his
own
kind
whom
likeness
drew
to
likeness
so
king
spent
day
after
day
in
the
cañons
and
on
the
ridges
and
yet
through
ben
gaynor
thought
to
keep
an
eye
on
old
loony
honeycutt
but
there
were
many
hours
alone
in
the
forests
resting
sitting
over
a
bubbling
lying
in
his
blankets
under
the
stars
that
king
thought
very
little
of
brodie
gus
ingle
or
honeycutt
there
were
times
when
the
solitudes
were
empty
when
a
new
strange
feeling
of
loneliness
swept
overpoweringly
over
him
at
such
moments
he
fancied
that
a
girl
came
stealing
through
the
trees
to
him
that
she
slipped
her
hand
into
his
own
that
she
lifted
to
his
her
soft
eyes
that
something
within
the
soul
of
him
spoke
to
her
and
that
she
answered
his
pulses
quickened
a
great
yearning
as
of
infinite
hunger
possessed
him
he
remembered
how
they
had
stood
together
upon
the
ridge
the
last
time
how
his
arms
had
been
opening
for
her
the
look
in
her
eyes
that
had
been
a
moment
when
the
world
had
lain
at
their
feet
when
they
had
been
lifted
up
and
up
close
to
the
gates
of
paradise
he
saw
virtually
nothing
of
brodie
now
and
then
smoke
from
a
once
or
twice
the
charred
coals
where
brodie
men
had
been
before
him
upon
these
camp
sites
he
looked
contemptuously
carelessness
and
wastefulness
were
two
things
he
hated
in
a
woodsman
and
always
he
found
them
in
brodie
wake
also
he
found
bottles
further
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
he
could
go
in
the
dark
to
the
particular
cañon
in
which
the
illicit
still
made
its
output
of
bad
moonshine
whiskey
but
though
that
canon
lay
in
the
heart
of
the
country
he
was
combing
over
it
was
one
which
he
had
explored
from
top
to
bottom
two
years
ago
and
now
was
content
to
leave
aside
one
day
he
came
upon
signs
of
a
killing
made
the
day
before
by
one
of
brodie
outfit
he
assumed
some
one
had
baited
for
a
bear
and
had
killed
the
mother
bear
he
discovered
the
following
morning
for
he
came
upon
a
little
brown
cub
whimpering
dismally
king
made
the
rebellious
little
fellow
an
unwilling
captive
and
smiled
as
he
thought
of
gloria
gloria
had
talked
of
bear
cubs
if
she
but
had
one
for
a
pet
well
here
was
gloria
pet
king
that
day
turned
toward
the
log
house
and
thus
he
received
at
last
gloria
note
at
jim
spalding
hands
dear
mark
mamma
and
i
have
to
go
back
to
town
i
am
so
sorry
that
i
ca
stay
up
here
always
and
always
do
you
realize
that
i
have
never
seen
you
in
the
city
it
lots
of
fun
too
in
its
own
way
do
you
think
another
kind
of
a
wilderness
i
wonder
if
you
would
come
down
if
i
asked
you
to
i
say
it
very
nicely
and
properly
like
this
gloria
gaynor
requests
the
pleasure
of
mark
king
presence
at
her
little
on
the
evening
of
august
twelfth
at
eight
just
the
four
of
us
mark
mamma
and
papa
you
and
gloria
august
twelfth
said
king
i
go
he
did
write
as
the
necessity
of
an
answer
did
not
suggest
itself
to
him
he
took
it
for
granted
that
she
would
know
that
he
would
come
he
chuckled
as
he
thought
of
the
birthday
gift
he
would
bring
her
there
was
still
a
week
he
remained
with
spalding
at
the
gaynor
mountain
home
and
devoted
hour
after
hour
to
taming
the
cub
on
the
eleventh
he
was
in
san
francisco
before
he
had
taken
a
taxi
at
the
ferry
building
it
had
dawned
on
him
that
his
best
suit
of
clothes
was
somewhat
outworn
it
would
never
do
to
go
to
the
gaynors
in
that
nor
was
there
time
for
a
tailor
therefore
he
went
direct
to
a
in
market
street
and
in
something
less
than
half
an
hour
had
bought
suit
hat
shoes
socks
shirt
collar
and
tie
i
can
have
the
alterations
made
by
afternoon
said
the
salesman
what
alterations
demanded
king
turning
before
the
long
glass
and
staring
at
his
new
finery
the
coat
is
a
trifle
tight
just
here
the
trousers
king
laughed
as
long
as
i
satisfied
you
are
are
you
he
said
the
clerk
watched
him
with
admiring
eyes
as
he
went
out
for
the
clerk
an
odd
thing
in
a
man
who
sold
clothing
and
therefore
was
prone
to
judge
by
clothes
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
real
man
big
mining
man
most
likely
muttered
the
clerk
do
care
for
clothes
and
is
rich
enough
to
get
by
with
whatever
he
wears
he
looked
vaguely
envious
king
was
busied
for
an
hour
or
so
finding
quarters
for
his
cub
registering
at
the
francis
getting
a
shave
and
a
manicurist
saw
his
hands
and
smothering
a
giggle
pointed
them
out
to
the
young
fellow
she
was
working
on
go
after
them
he
grinned
there
a
fortune
for
you
in
them
nothing
doing
she
returned
from
her
higher
wisdom
he
ai
the
kind
that
knows
he
got
any
hands
unless
he
got
a
job
for
them
to
do
later
king
telephoned
to
the
gaynor
home
a
maid
answered
and
informed
him
that
gaynor
had
not
arrived
yet
though
he
was
expected
this
afternoon
or
in
the
morning
that
both
and
miss
gaynor
were
out
king
hung
up
without
leaving
his
name
king
sat
in
the
lobby
musing
on
san
francisco
as
gloria
had
said
it
was
a
wilderness
of
its
own
sort
time
was
when
it
had
appealed
to
him
that
was
in
the
younger
collegiate
days
he
wondered
what
had
happened
to
his
proud
evening
regalia
how
he
had
strutted
in
it
dances
and
dinners
and
but
briefly
and
long
long
ago
it
was
like
a
former
incarnation
or
rather
like
the
unfamiliar
existence
of
some
other
man
he
grew
restless
over
his
paper
and
strolled
into
the
bar
there
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
stumble
on
a
man
he
knew
an
old
mining
engineer
the
two
got
off
into
a
corner
and
talked
later
they
dined
and
went
to
the
theatre
together
the
next
evening
king
got
a
taxi
called
for
his
bear
cub
stopped
at
a
florist
for
an
armful
of
early
violets
and
growing
more
eager
and
impatient
at
every
block
was
off
to
the
gaynor
home
here
you
are
sir
said
the
chauffeur
opening
the
door
king
fancied
the
man
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
number
the
house
was
blazing
with
lights
upstairs
and
down
there
was
an
unmistakable
air
of
revelry
about
it
faintly
the
music
of
a
new
dance
tune
violin
and
piccolo
and
piano
crept
out
into
the
night
above
the
music
he
could
hear
gay
voices
muffled
by
door
and
window
and
wall
king
was
of
a
mind
to
go
back
to
the
hotel
he
had
counted
on
the
gaynors
alone
not
on
this
sort
of
thing
but
also
most
of
all
he
had
counted
on
gloria
and
his
hesitation
was
brief
he
jumped
down
and
leading
his
bear
cub
by
its
new
chain
went
up
the
steps
a
housemaid
came
to
the
door
opened
it
wide
for
him
saw
the
cub
against
his
leg
and
screamed
why
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
frieda
said
some
one
it
was
gloria
passing
through
the
front
hallway
with
a
worshipful
youth
gloria
came
to
the
door
the
youth
at
her
heels
looking
over
her
shoulder
oh
cried
gloria
king
knew
then
in
a
flash
that
she
had
not
expected
him
that
probably
because
he
had
never
answered
her
letter
she
had
forgotten
all
about
it
unconsciously
he
stiffened
his
old
gesture
before
a
woman
but
now
gloria
came
running
out
to
him
her
two
hands
offered
her
eyes
alight
with
pleasure
you
did
come
she
said
gladly
gloria
escort
obviously
holding
himself
to
be
privileged
through
virtue
of
his
briefly
temporary
office
thrust
himself
along
in
her
wake
him
king
did
not
notice
king
saw
only
gloria
as
of
old
she
set
his
pulse
stirring
restlessly
with
her
sparkling
vivid
loveliness
was
gloria
night
she
was
eighteen
and
queen
of
the
world
and
oh
look
she
let
her
hands
remain
in
his
but
her
eyes
were
all
for
the
little
brown
bundle
of
fur
at
king
feet
that
began
now
to
whine
and
pull
back
at
its
chain
my
birthday
present
just
now
mark
king
would
have
given
anything
he
could
think
of
to
have
that
bear
cub
back
in
the
woods
where
it
belonged
he
had
had
time
to
analyse
impulses
he
did
know
why
all
of
a
sudden
his
gift
seemed
out
of
place
as
he
let
gloria
fingers
slip
through
his
he
looked
at
the
young
fellow
a
boy
of
gloria
own
age
in
the
doorway
perhaps
the
full
evening
dress
had
something
to
do
with
king
new
attitude
toward
his
pet
but
now
as
gloria
a
little
timid
and
holding
her
skirts
back
and
yet
clearly
delighted
flashed
him
her
look
of
understanding
and
gratitude
he
was
content
gloria
remembered
to
make
king
known
to
trimble
then
king
suggested
that
they
take
the
cub
around
back
and
lodge
him
for
the
night
in
the
garage
but
gloria
discovering
that
she
could
pat
and
fondle
the
little
creature
and
that
he
was
of
friendly
disposition
insisted
on
having
him
brought
into
the
house
for
all
to
see
it
the
most
delightful
present
of
all
she
whispered
to
king
in
the
hallway
they
were
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
the
curious
girls
in
pretty
dresses
young
fellows
in
black
suits
all
very
exact
as
to
the
proper
evening
appointments
at
first
they
were
disposed
to
look
on
king
as
the
man
who
brought
the
cub
and
it
was
only
when
gloria
began
a
string
of
introductions
that
they
understood
one
and
all
they
regarded
mark
king
curiously
the
cub
was
made
much
of
and
finally
led
off
to
the
kitchen
for
sugar
and
a
bed
in
a
box
under
the
table
gaynor
appeared
and
was
very
glad
indeed
to
see
king
again
gratton
whom
king
remembered
with
small
liking
came
up
and
shook
hands
and
looked
at
king
in
a
way
which
did
nothing
to
increase
the
liking
ben
it
appeared
had
been
unable
to
come
this
year
king
was
sorry
for
that
as
he
looked
about
him
only
now
did
he
remember
the
violets
he
had
brought
for
gloria
the
evening
was
anything
but
that
to
which
he
had
looked
forward
from
the
beginning
he
regretted
coming
before
the
end
it
was
slow
torture
for
him
he
was
out
of
place
and
felt
more
out
of
place
than
he
was
glances
at
his
carelessly
purchased
clothes
were
veiled
and
never
utterly
impolite
but
he
was
conscious
of
them
he
was
conspicuous
because
he
was
different
outwardly
in
garb
inwardly
in
much
else
there
was
no
one
here
whom
he
knew
he
had
never
felt
that
he
knew
gloria
mother
and
gloria
self
puzzling
him
baffling
him
was
an
unknown
not
that
she
was
not
delightful
to
him
she
was
just
as
delightful
to
every
other
man
there
and
in
the
same
way
his
days
with
her
in
the
forest
blurred
and
faded
gloria
gave
him
the
first
dance
after
his
arrival
highhandedly
commanding
a
and
despondent
youth
to
surrender
to
king
one
of
his
numbers
king
caught
her
into
his
arms
hungrily
only
to
feel
that
she
was
very
far
away
from
him
he
knew
that
he
was
dancing
awkwardly
he
had
not
danced
for
a
dozen
years
gloria
suggested
sitting
out
the
rest
of
the
dance
she
said
it
prettily
but
he
understood
he
understood
too
by
that
sixth
sense
of
man
which
is
so
keen
at
certain
moments
of
mental
distress
that
all
of
gloria
friends
were
wondering
about
him
where
he
came
from
what
his
business
was
he
was
tanned
rugged
he
was
not
of
them
he
fancied
sensitively
that
among
themselves
they
laughed
at
him
as
he
sat
with
gloria
and
found
little
to
say
he
was
conscious
of
her
eyes
probing
at
him
when
she
thought
that
he
did
not
see
he
looked
away
a
shadow
in
his
eyes
and
chanced
to
see
gratton
gratton
who
had
struck
him
as
contemptible
in
the
woods
a
misfit
and
a
poor
sort
of
man
at
best
was
here
on
his
own
heath
he
carried
himself
well
he
talked
well
he
bore
himself
with
a
certain
distinction
clearly
he
was
much
in
favour
among
the
girls
and
women
much
envied
by
the
younger
men
yes
gloria
was
right
this
was
another
sort
of
wilderness
where
mark
king
was
the
misfit
where
gratton
was
as
much
in
tone
with
his
environment
as
was
king
among
the
forest
and
crags
of
the
ridges
another
dance
gloria
excused
herself
lightly
and
escaped
into
the
arms
of
gratton
himself
escaped
king
understood
that
was
the
word
for
it
he
watched
them
saw
gratton
whisper
something
into
her
ear
saw
gloria
toss
her
head
saw
her
cheeks
flush
then
gratton
laughed
and
she
laughed
with
him
they
danced
wonderfully
together
swaying
together
like
two
reeds
in
the
same
gentle
wind
others
than
king
noticed
there
were
knowing
smiles
at
the
end
of
the
dance
king
saw
the
look
which
gloria
flushed
and
happy
flashed
up
at
gratton
and
his
heart
contracted
in
a
sudden
spasm
of
pain
when
again
couples
were
seeking
each
other
to
the
jazzy
invitation
of
the
musicians
king
slipped
away
and
went
outside
he
stood
in
the
shadows
of
the
porch
seeking
to
get
a
grip
on
himself
in
a
moment
he
would
go
in
and
say
to
gaynor
he
say
to
gloria
he
would
go
and
put
an
end
to
a
hideous
nightmare
he
held
himself
very
much
of
a
fool
and
he
knew
that
he
was
fanciful
but
he
was
of
no
mind
to
stay
two
or
three
couples
came
out
he
remained
unnoticed
in
the
darkness
he
heard
a
girl
voice
but
is
he
i
think
he
terribly
handsome
and
superior
to
our
kind
of
nonsense
who
are
you
talking
about
betty
her
dancing
partner
pretended
to
be
in
doubt
me
a
whirlwind
of
girls
laughter
then
one
of
them
saying
or
handsome
she
means
the
serge
suit
good
god
was
there
a
price
tag
on
him
oh
the
animal
trainer
they
laughed
again
then
gloria
came
and
they
called
to
her
demanding
is
he
oh
said
gloria
carelessly
he
is
an
old
friend
of
papa
and
his
name
is
king
they
went
in
two
of
the
girls
lingering
a
little
behind
the
others
gloria
and
another
the
other
bantering
and
yet
curious
said
georgia
told
me
all
about
a
king
up
in
the
mountains
this
spring
and
that
it
looked
like
love
at
first
sight
to
her
up
glory
my
dear
gloria
laughter
unfettered
spontaneous
was
of
high
amusement
georgia
said
just
the
same
that
she
bet
on
an
elopement
king
reddened
and
stirred
uneasily
gloria
gasped
georgia
crazy
she
said
emphatically
why
the
man
is
impossible
five
minutes
later
king
went
in
found
his
hat
and
told
gaynor
she
was
glad
that
he
was
going
and
he
knew
it
though
she
made
the
obvious
perfunctory
remark
gloria
saw
and
came
tripping
across
the
room
not
going
so
soon
yes
he
said
briefly
gloria
you
mean
do
you
i
mean
he
said
quietly
gratton
thrust
forward
king
left
abruptly
leaving
them
together
conscious
of
the
quick
look
of
pleasure
on
the
face
of
gloria
mother
always
gloria
yielding
to
the
heady
impulses
of
youth
was
ready
for
high
adventure
therein
lay
the
explanation
of
many
things
which
gloria
did
time
went
scurrying
on
mark
king
had
returned
to
the
sierra
no
word
came
from
him
and
gloria
told
herself
with
an
exaggerated
air
of
indifference
that
she
had
just
about
forgotten
him
autumn
came
that
finest
of
all
seasons
about
san
francisco
bay
the
ocean
fogs
were
thrust
back
unveiling
the
clear
sunny
skies
by
day
the
crystalline
glitter
of
stars
by
night
the
city
grew
gayer
as
the
season
advanced
dinners
and
dances
and
made
life
a
gloriously
joyful
affair
for
gloria
she
had
hardly
the
time
to
ask
herself
just
where
am
i
going
it
was
so
much
easier
to
laugh
and
cry
lightly
in
the
phrase
of
the
day
i
am
on
my
way
she
had
drifted
drifted
like
one
in
a
canoe
trailing
her
fingers
idly
in
the
clear
water
and
never
noting
when
the
little
craft
was
caught
by
a
steady
purposeful
current
it
was
speeding
now
but
she
only
laughed
breathlessly
and
drank
her
fill
of
the
hour
and
left
to
others
the
thoughts
which
carve
fine
lines
about
brow
and
eyes
she
knew
that
her
father
was
beset
by
some
sort
of
financial
troubles
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
he
had
not
come
to
her
and
her
mother
had
explained
rather
soberly
that
it
was
because
of
a
business
crisis
gloria
did
not
know
that
crises
lasted
so
long
weeks
and
weeks
had
gone
and
still
she
knew
from
a
look
which
her
mother
could
not
hide
that
the
money
troubles
were
still
stalking
her
father
and
coming
so
close
that
for
the
first
time
in
history
they
cast
a
shadow
from
the
top
of
the
sierra
down
into
her
mother
heart
in
san
francisco
now
gratton
became
the
man
of
the
hour
he
had
studied
gloria
with
infinite
patience
and
he
never
displeased
her
he
understood
her
as
she
comfortingly
assured
herself
that
meant
of
course
that
he
gave
in
to
her
always
that
tirelessly
he
exerted
himself
to
please
her
at
a
time
when
there
was
much
financial
depression
gratton
obvious
affluence
was
very
agreeable
to
the
he
dressed
well
he
entertained
with
due
respect
for
the
most
charming
accessories
he
took
her
to
dance
or
theatre
or
for
a
drive
in
the
park
or
down
the
peninsula
in
a
new
elegantly
appointed
limousine
and
about
the
same
time
fate
had
it
that
by
two
entirely
unassociated
trends
of
circumstance
he
should
draw
to
the
dregs
of
gloria
lively
and
romantic
interest
in
the
first
place
he
began
to
become
a
prominent
figure
in
san
francisco
his
name
was
in
the
papers
with
names
of
men
who
counted
and
of
far
greater
import
to
gloria
he
became
what
she
liked
to
consider
a
man
of
mystery
for
weeks
ago
gloria
had
noted
that
regularly
once
a
week
gratton
dropped
out
of
sight
to
be
gone
for
one
or
two
days
he
was
never
to
be
seen
saturday
seldom
sunday
always
any
day
from
monday
to
friday
night
during
he
was
out
of
town
and
though
there
were
countless
opportunities
for
an
explanation
gratton
never
gave
it
others
than
gloria
remarked
the
fact
a
girl
friend
insinuatingly
remarked
better
watch
out
for
him
glory
dear
la
you
know
gloria
never
suspected
any
such
condition
of
affairs
she
was
too
sure
of
gratton
attentions
but
being
gloria
she
wondered
one
night
she
and
gratton
were
having
a
late
supper
together
at
the
palace
they
had
been
to
the
theatre
and
now
yielding
to
the
demands
of
her
young
appetite
they
sat
before
sandwiches
and
coffee
gloria
saw
the
page
as
he
came
to
the
doorway
he
stood
an
envelope
in
his
hand
looking
up
and
down
the
room
when
at
last
his
eyes
rested
on
her
and
her
companion
the
boy
came
to
the
table
telegram
mr
gratton
gratton
more
interested
in
what
she
was
saying
than
in
the
yellow
envelope
opened
it
carelessly
but
in
a
flash
his
attention
was
whipped
away
from
her
she
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
knew
that
he
had
not
noticed
a
quick
spurt
of
blood
flushed
his
skin
his
eyes
grew
bright
with
excitement
he
read
in
a
sweeping
glance
and
before
his
eyes
came
back
to
her
they
went
hurriedly
to
his
watch
i
got
to
go
gloria
he
said
nervously
immediately
this
is
important
why
of
course
she
agreed
i
can
get
a
bite
when
i
get
home
he
thrust
the
telegram
into
his
pocket
and
came
around
to
the
back
of
her
chair
he
was
all
impatience
it
seemed
he
could
not
wait
until
hat
and
coats
were
gotten
on
the
way
to
the
street
he
looked
again
at
his
watch
i
got
to
go
out
of
town
he
explained
i
be
gone
a
couple
of
days
but
this
is
only
wednesday
and
usually
i
do
go
before
saturday
he
was
tapping
at
his
as
they
came
to
their
taxi
yes
but
something
has
happened
he
helped
her
in
and
lifted
his
foot
to
follow
gloria
he
muttered
i
ca
make
it
if
i
see
you
home
i
will
miss
the
last
boat
across
the
bay
she
was
more
and
more
interested
she
had
never
known
gratton
to
show
emotion
as
he
showed
it
she
was
more
and
more
curious
about
that
business
which
carried
him
out
of
town
why
had
he
tossed
the
telegram
across
the
table
for
her
to
read
here
was
a
shut
door
and
from
being
barred
a
door
always
invites
the
more
temptingly
especially
to
a
girl
like
gloria
why
i
can
go
home
alone
i
do
like
it
i
he
ended
abruptly
and
thrust
his
head
into
the
car
his
eyes
questing
hers
in
the
the
chauffeur
with
his
engine
going
looked
over
his
shoulder
come
with
me
gloria
gloria
wondered
what
he
meant
whether
the
man
was
suggesting
an
elopement
or
just
a
wild
bit
of
downright
unconventionality
i
mean
it
said
gratton
listen
the
new
day
has
already
started
by
the
time
the
ferry
lands
us
in
oakland
it
will
be
nearly
three
i
got
to
drive
up
into
the
country
we
phone
your
mother
and
will
start
right
away
we
get
there
long
before
noon
we
be
back
before
night
it
would
mean
only
a
day
outing
and
no
harm
done
wo
you
come
gloria
please
come
he
pulled
out
his
watch
again
we
just
got
time
to
catch
the
boat
comfortably
he
called
to
the
to
the
ferry
and
jumped
in
but
you
can
come
as
far
as
the
ferry
anyway
even
if
you
wo
give
me
a
day
of
motoring
it
wonderful
out
in
the
country
this
time
of
year
and
when
they
came
to
the
ferry
there
was
no
time
for
debating
the
matter
the
crowd
was
pouring
toward
the
last
boat
and
gloria
her
eyes
bright
with
the
joy
of
her
escapade
went
with
him
through
the
little
gate
where
the
tickets
were
presented
for
the
last
boat
across
the
bay
it
was
unconventional
as
she
saw
quite
clearly
but
to
gloria
unconventionality
was
a
condition
fairly
divided
into
two
widely
separated
there
was
the
thing
which
was
just
daring
there
was
that
other
which
was
ugly
because
it
was
compromising
this
adventure
promised
to
fall
into
the
safer
category
to
be
off
motoring
with
gratton
from
three
in
the
morning
until
late
afternoon
was
what
she
considered
a
lark
they
laughed
together
in
anticipation
as
they
crossed
the
bay
they
sat
where
they
could
watch
the
red
and
green
lights
reflected
like
topazes
and
rubies
in
the
shimmering
water
fall
away
and
dwindle
as
the
silhouette
of
the
embarcadero
receded
on
the
electric
train
they
were
whizzed
among
many
sleepy
folk
into
a
sleeping
town
oakland
drowsing
and
silent
gratton
summoned
a
somnolent
and
they
were
whisked
through
the
cool
air
to
a
garage
he
left
her
a
moment
sitting
in
the
taxi
while
he
ran
in
and
arranged
for
a
roadster
gloria
left
to
her
own
thoughts
began
to
regret
having
come
the
thing
reviewed
in
solitude
was
crazy
she
grew
vaguely
distressed
she
wanted
to
go
back
to
san
francisco
but
there
would
be
no
boat
now
until
full
morning
three
or
four
hours
she
could
not
get
home
before
seven
or
seven
she
tried
to
recall
a
friend
on
this
side
of
the
bay
to
whom
she
could
go
at
this
time
of
night
day
rather
her
lips
shaped
to
a
half
smile
i
got
the
car
gratton
was
back
offering
to
help
her
down
and
i
phoned
your
mother
was
she
she
trusts
you
with
me
gloria
he
said
quickly
she
let
him
help
her
into
the
car
he
had
hired
gratton
took
the
wheel
and
turned
into
san
pablo
avenue
the
street
was
deserted
and
he
gently
pressed
down
the
throttle
he
had
hired
a
dependable
car
and
the
motor
sang
softly
the
wind
blew
in
gloria
face
and
her
zest
came
back
to
her
gratton
would
not
tell
her
where
they
were
going
he
made
a
great
lark
of
their
escapade
assuring
her
gaily
that
their
destination
was
reserved
as
the
final
surprise
for
her
he
evaded
laughingly
when
she
asked
maybe
we
keep
right
on
going
always
and
always
he
jested
with
her
she
thought
that
under
the
jest
there
was
a
queer
note
when
his
eyes
flashed
briefly
toward
her
she
tried
to
read
their
message
but
the
hour
filled
them
with
mystery
gloria
began
laughing
what
will
we
look
like
i
mean
when
it
full
day
me
dressed
like
this
you
in
evening
suit
by
jove
said
gratton
then
he
laughed
with
her
it
the
lark
of
my
life
the
ocean
breeze
smarted
in
their
eyes
the
motor
thrummed
merrily
trees
and
houses
flew
by
the
racing
car
leaped
to
fresh
speed
on
the
cement
highway
the
spinning
tyres
whined
musically
they
were
far
when
the
sun
rose
gloria
very
sleepy
now
watched
it
climb
above
the
hills
she
had
watched
the
sunrise
last
june
with
mark
king
later
again
with
mark
king
she
had
seen
it
thrust
its
great
burning
disk
above
the
pine
ridges
she
was
asleep
and
started
wide
awake
when
the
car
stopped
suddenly
they
were
in
the
one
street
of
a
little
town
it
must
be
eight
she
was
cold
what
do
you
say
to
a
cup
of
coffee
and
toast
and
eggs
i
am
hungry
she
confessed
over
their
breakfast
in
the
little
wayside
restaurant
with
its
untidy
tables
and
greasy
it
was
gratton
who
did
all
of
the
talking
gloria
by
now
realized
that
she
was
downright
sorry
she
had
come
he
seemed
eager
his
eyes
very
bright
his
voice
quick
and
vibrant
with
an
electrical
urge
dominating
she
wondered
vaguely
what
made
him
seem
different
the
waiter
she
said
as
they
finished
is
staring
his
head
off
at
our
clothes
we
going
to
remedy
that
matter
come
on
the
stores
are
open
fancy
shopping
here
the
thought
made
her
laugh
just
the
place
for
what
we
want
khaki
trousers
and
flannel
shirt
and
boots
for
me
an
for
you
he
took
her
arm
and
they
walked
the
doors
to
the
store
i
have
a
cent
with
me
let
me
be
your
banker
he
said
lightly
gloria
hesitated
but
very
briefly
hot
coffee
had
done
much
for
her
drooping
courage
the
escapade
even
this
going
at
eight
in
the
morning
into
a
country
store
with
a
man
and
on
money
borrowed
from
the
man
was
an
experience
to
put
the
gay
note
of
adventure
back
into
the
affair
gloria
made
her
purchases
in
fifteen
minutes
and
the
change
from
theatre
gown
into
an
olive
in
another
fifteen
her
discarded
garments
were
gathered
up
put
into
a
cardboard
box
by
the
clerk
and
wrapped
in
heavy
paper
to
be
stowed
away
in
the
car
she
confronted
gratton
smilingly
in
her
new
garb
her
hands
in
her
pockets
her
face
saucy
her
slim
body
boyish
in
its
swagger
and
richly
feminine
in
its
unhidden
curves
gratton
eyes
shone
quick
with
admiration
she
laughed
and
a
flush
came
into
her
cheeks
as
he
gravely
paid
for
her
clothing
and
his
own
when
they
went
to
their
car
both
were
strangely
silent
i
owe
you
a
lot
of
money
she
said
with
assumed
carelessness
which
i
hope
you
never
repay
he
returned
meaningly
at
nine
they
were
threading
the
streets
of
sacramento
at
a
little
after
ten
they
were
in
auburn
they
drove
through
old
town
passed
the
courthouse
and
through
the
newer
portion
of
the
village
by
the
freeman
hotel
and
the
through
the
subway
under
the
tracks
and
turned
off
to
the
right
leaving
the
highway
for
the
first
time
and
skirting
the
on
the
hill
then
sweeping
around
a
wide
curve
they
caught
the
first
glimpse
of
the
american
river
deep
down
in
its
historic
canon
on
over
a
narrow
road
closer
down
to
the
gorge
across
the
long
bridge
up
and
up
the
steep
writhing
grade
they
came
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
raced
through
cool
through
lotus
coloma
gasped
gloria
you
are
going
to
coloma
he
slowed
the
car
down
that
he
might
look
at
her
keenly
well
he
said
lightly
it
is
to
coloma
that
you
have
been
coming
every
week
well
he
said
a
second
time
then
you
you
too
he
glanced
at
the
road
cut
down
the
speed
still
more
and
looked
back
into
her
thoughtful
eyes
would
you
rather
that
it
was
mark
king
or
i
who
succeeded
she
was
clearly
perplexed
mark
king
is
papa
partner
she
said
musingly
and
i
i
hope
one
day
to
be
more
than
his
partner
she
understood
but
gave
no
sign
of
understanding
he
did
not
press
the
point
here
we
are
he
said
presently
as
the
first
of
the
picturesque
old
houses
of
coloma
stood
forth
out
of
the
wilderness
and
you
dead
tired
and
nearly
dead
for
sleep
i
am
sorry
we
ca
have
a
city
hotel
up
here
but
i
get
you
a
room
where
you
can
lie
down
you
can
sleep
and
rest
for
two
or
three
hours
then
we
start
back
gloria
had
been
tired
and
sleepy
half
an
hour
ago
not
now
gratton
was
playing
his
own
hand
in
his
own
way
against
her
father
and
against
mark
king
and
gratton
had
a
way
of
winning
something
had
happened
some
one
had
telegraphed
for
him
to
come
gloria
was
aquiver
with
excitement
she
watched
gratton
while
he
was
watching
the
road
he
too
was
tense
and
eager
when
he
stopped
the
car
she
got
down
not
knowing
just
what
to
do
or
say
he
led
the
way
to
the
little
hotel
and
she
followed
since
she
could
not
insist
on
following
him
about
his
business
it
was
perhaps
just
as
well
if
she
lay
down
and
alone
thought
things
out
he
placed
a
chair
for
her
and
arranged
for
her
room
he
paid
for
it
in
advance
saying
that
they
would
be
leaving
in
a
hurry
he
registered
for
her
then
gloria
was
shown
down
a
long
hall
and
to
her
room
here
gratton
left
her
impatient
to
be
away
she
went
to
her
window
and
stood
looking
out
she
heard
a
man
call
a
deep
rumbling
bass
voice
she
saw
gratton
come
about
the
corner
of
the
house
and
start
across
the
street
a
man
a
very
big
man
came
to
meet
him
they
stood
together
talking
in
the
middle
of
the
road
their
voices
low
their
looks
earnest
they
went
away
together
she
shivered
and
went
to
her
bed
and
sat
down
her
hands
tight
clasped
a
look
of
trouble
in
her
eyes
gratton
and
swen
brodie
together
i
do
understand
she
said
it
to
herself
over
and
over
i
understand
she
sprang
up
and
left
the
room
going
in
feverish
haste
back
to
the
front
part
of
the
building
the
man
who
had
given
gratton
the
register
followed
her
with
his
speculative
eyes
she
went
to
the
door
and
looked
out
seeing
neither
the
dusty
road
the
deserted
house
across
the
way
nor
the
mountains
beyond
she
was
groping
blindly
in
a
mental
fog
she
was
tired
very
tired
and
uncertain
something
was
happening
had
happened
or
was
about
to
happen
and
she
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
her
father
poor
old
papa
was
fighting
hard
against
some
kind
of
money
troubles
mark
king
gratton
brodie
figures
to
race
through
her
brain
to
confuse
her
with
their
own
contentions
to
baffle
and
bewilder
suddenly
she
felt
utterly
alone
hopelessly
helplessly
alone
she
wanted
her
mother
and
with
the
impulse
wheeled
back
toward
the
man
watching
her
i
want
to
use
the
telephone
she
said
where
is
it
this
way
miss
said
the
man
eager
to
be
of
service
then
with
a
bashful
grin
he
amended
i
pardon
gratton
i
mean
gloria
stared
at
him
her
mouth
was
open
to
correct
him
she
saw
how
naturally
his
mistake
was
made
but
before
she
could
speak
a
wild
flutter
in
her
heart
stopped
the
words
she
went
swiftly
to
the
register
in
gratton
own
hand
set
opposite
the
clerk
number
seven
indicating
her
room
were
the
words
gratton
wife
she
turned
crimson
went
white
i
telephone
later
she
said
faintly
and
went
again
to
the
door
and
this
time
out
into
the
autumn
sunshine
all
of
the
high
adventure
was
dead
ashes
the
lark
was
lost
in
a
sinister
enterprise
gratton
wife
gratton
he
had
done
that
she
walked
on
blindly
tears
gathered
tears
of
mortification
of
blazing
anger
but
they
did
not
fall
she
dabbed
viciously
at
her
eyes
why
had
he
done
that
never
a
why
so
insistent
in
all
of
the
girl
lifetime
never
a
moment
of
such
blind
wonder
howdy
miss
a
voice
was
saying
it
brought
her
back
to
earth
from
a
region
of
swirling
vapours
back
to
and
coloma
she
stopped
and
looked
at
the
man
startled
he
was
a
stranger
yet
dimly
familiar
the
little
store
his
own
round
face
his
and
boots
i
wanted
to
ask
he
said
solicitously
how
your
father
was
this
morning
my
father
she
repeated
dully
oh
he
quite
well
thank
you
plainly
her
words
puzzled
him
he
squinted
his
eyes
as
though
to
make
sure
of
her
you
the
young
lady
that
stopped
in
here
one
day
last
spring
with
mark
king
june
it
was
was
it
you
bought
some
stuff
for
lunch
yes
she
admitted
she
would
never
have
remembered
him
but
he
who
had
not
seen
others
like
her
remembered
then
you
ben
gaynor
girl
yes
she
said
again
and
was
about
to
go
on
resenting
his
persistent
meddlesomeness
and
you
say
he
quite
well
i
believe
she
said
coolly
but
wait
a
minute
he
called
after
her
was
he
bad
hurt
last
night
papa

i
supposed
that
was
why
you
was
here
how
hurt
she
cried
sharply
when
where
tell
me
why
do
you
tell
me
he
looked
at
her
in
wonder
all
i
know
is
just
what
i
heard
and
you
know
how
news
gets
itself
all
twisted
up
travelling
half
a
mile
i
he
got
hurt
at
old
loony
honeycutt
last
night
right
bad
hurt
they
said
but
i
was
just
asking
you
where
is
he
she
cut
in
excitedly
now
did
you
just
come
out
of
the
hotel
he
looked
more
puzzled
than
ever
was
he
there
how
do
i
know
was
he
taken
there
he
nodded
leastways
i
heard
he
was
last
night
gloria
did
not
wait
for
more
she
turned
and
ran
back
to
the
building
she
had
quitted
only
a
moment
ago
bursting
into
the
front
room
demanding
earnestly
and
in
words
that
came
with
a
rush
is
my
father
here
is
he
hurt
your
father
hurt
say
you
ai
ben
gaynor
daughter
are
you
yes
yes
and
papa
they
had
a
doctor
over
from
placerville
last
night
he
coming
back
again
this
morning
some
time
take
me
to
papa
quick
said
gloria
imperiously
you
should
have
told
me
the
minute
i
came
but
i
did
know
quick
repeated
gloria
he
showed
her
to
the
room
only
three
doors
beyond
her
own
he
moved
to
open
the
door
but
gloria
hand
was
first
to
the
knob
she
opened
and
went
in
closing
the
door
softly
she
was
trembling
frightened
dreading
oppressed
by
fear
of
what
might
be
though
both
windows
were
open
the
shades
were
drawn
the
light
was
dim
she
made
out
a
man
form
on
the
bed
there
was
a
white
bandage
about
his
head
he
stirred
and
turned
half
over
papa
cried
gloria
her
voice
catching
she
ran
to
him
and
went
down
on
her
knees
at
his
bedside
her
two
hands
finding
his
upon
the
coverlet
clasping
them
tight
he
looked
at
her
in
wonderment
gloria
misread
the
look
in
his
eyes
and
for
a
terrible
moment
thought
that
he
was
dying
gloria
he
said
in
amazement
here
oh
papa
to
ben
gaynor
this
unannounced
coming
of
his
daughter
partook
of
the
nature
of
an
apparition
and
of
a
miracle
at
first
he
would
not
believe
his
senses
fearing
that
he
had
just
gone
off
his
head
then
it
was
that
the
look
in
his
eyes
frightened
her
but
the
hands
gripping
his
were
hands
and
besides
ben
gaynor
was
a
very
man
little
given
to
prolonged
fanciful
ideas
even
after
a
night
of
pain
and
mental
distress
by
the
lord
we
nail
their
hides
to
our
barn
door
yet
were
his
first
words
of
greeting
he
hitched
himself
up
against
his
pillows
what
in
the
world
happened
gloria
asked
after
a
sigh
of
relief
how
you
happened
to
be
here
gets
me
said
gaynor
it
like
magic
you
did
hear
down
in
san
francisco
that
i
was
hurt
did
you
no
i
i
just
happened
to
be
here
you
see
papa
that
come
later
he
broke
in
you
here
that
all
that
counts
you
going
to
do
something
for
me
anything
thought
gloria
and
she
was
glad
that
he
did
not
seek
just
now
the
explanation
of
her
presence
here
of
course
she
would
tell
him
everything
later
but
she
was
still
confused
gratton
did
she
down
in
the
depths
of
her
frivolous
want
to
be
that
had
she
glimpsed
when
she
so
gaily
left
san
francisco
last
night
that
this
escapade
was
something
more
than
a
mere
lark
you
are
not
dangerously
hurt
papa
bless
you
no
not
now
that
you
here
though
i
believe
it
would
have
near
killed
me
if
i
been
put
out
of
the
running
altogether
i
got
a
crack
on
the
head
that
sickened
me
but
the
tough
old
skull
held
out
against
it
and
i
got
an
arm
broken
and
a
rib
cracked
gloria
aghast
was
once
more
in
fear
for
him
but
he
cried
impatiently
do
you
worry
about
me
i
be
on
my
feet
in
a
week
now
listen
i
got
to
talk
fast
before
somebody
comes
in
the
doctor
is
apt
to
be
here
any
minute
and
he
a
tyrant
you
know
the
trail
through
the
mountains
to
our
place
you
rode
it
twice
with
king
yes
i
want
you
to
ride
it
again

can
get
a
horse
at
the
stable

any
one

where
you
are
going
i
want
you
to
take
a
message
to
king
and
it
got
to
get
to
him
and
into
nobody
hands
but
his
understand
that
gloria
gloria
did
not
answer
promptly
she
wanted
to
demur
she
was
tired
she
was
afraid
of
the
mountains
she
did
not
want
to
see
mark
king
but
she
saw
a
terrible
earnestness
in
her
father
eyes
and
that
while
he
awaited
her
answer
quick
fever
spots
glowed
in
his
cheeks
she
squeezed
his
hands
and
replied
of
course
papa
i
do
whatever
you
want
god
bless
you
for
that
he
muttered
this
is
sober
serious
business
gloria
you
are
the
only
one
here
i
could
trust
king
will
be
at
the
house
at
least
i
hope
he
will
i
sent
him
word
several
days
ago
that
that
something
was
in
the
wind
and
to
meet
me
there
and
gloria
i
want
you
to
promise
by
all
that
good
and
holy
that
you
wo
let
a
word
or
a
sign
or
a
hint
slip
to
anybody
else
not
to
a
soul
on
earth
will
you
gloria
yes
she
looked
at
him
curiously
she
had
never
known
her
father
to
be
so
tensely
in
earnest
then
he
said
go
turn
the
key
in
the
lock
and
hurry
before
any
one
comes
she
locked
the
door
and
returned
to
him
feel
under
my
pillow
got
it
she
felt
the
cold
barrel
of
a
revolver
and
started
back
never
had
she
known
her
father
to
carry
arms
then
gingerly
she
sought
again
she
found
a
small
parcel
and
drew
it
out
it
was
a
flattish
affair
and
rectangular
the
size
and
shape
of
an
octavo
volume
a
flat
box
if
not
a
book
it
was
wrapped
in
a
bit
of
soiled
cloth
quick
he
commanded
nervously
out
of
sight
with
it
stick
it
into
your
blouse
if
you
can
tuck
it
away
under
your
arm
it
wo
show
so
much
there
catching
something
of
his
suppressed
excitement
she
obeyed
i
managed
a
little
note
to
mark
he
said
when
she
had
buttoned
the
loose
shirt
again
and
he
had
sunk
back
white
and
exhausted
among
his
pillows
i
stuck
it
inside
the
cloth
lord
if
i
was
only
on
my
feet
but
you
do
it
for
me
my
girl
with
never
a
hint
to
any
one
gloria
stooped
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
i
promise
papa
she
said
assuringly
unlock
the
door
again
then
there
somebody
coming
sit
down
over
there
across
the
room
and
leave
as
soon
as
you
can
we
let
them
think
you
going
to
the
log
house
for
for
she
was
quicker
at
inventions
doctor
rowell
our
family
physician
is
at
lake
tahoe
i
am
going
to
find
him
we
would
telephone
but
he
is
camped
out
pretty
late
for
camping
oh
that
do
gloria
sat
in
her
chair
across
the
room
looking
innocently
the
part
of
a
daughter
in
a
when
the
door
opened
and
the
placerville
doctor
came
in
a
moment
later
she
slipped
out
she
went
out
into
the
sunshine
down
the
road
she
saw
gratton
he
came
quickly
to
meet
her
she
saw
that
he
was
eyeing
her
keenly
and
her
thought
was
that
he
was
wondering
if
by
chance
she
had
seen
the
hotel
register
i
do
know
just
what
to
do
said
gratton
my
business
is
going
to
hold
me
here
longer
than
i
had
thought
i
i
promised
to
go
back
with
you
this
afternoon
would
it
be
all
right
if
i
got
a
man
to
drive
you
back
i
am
terribly
sorry
gloria
but
business
is
business
she
laughed
a
trifle
nervously
then
her
inspiration
i
know
i
can
go
to
our
mountain
home
i
phone
mamma
and
she
will
come
up
we
spend
a
few
days
and
for
an
instant
his
eyes
fairly
blazed
they
were
bright
with
triumph
just
the
thing
i
go
for
the
horses
i
ride
over
with
you
and
get
right
back
here
but
but
already
excusing
himself
hurriedly
gratton
was
off
for
the
horses
it
was
when
gloria
and
gratton
came
to
the
log
house
in
the
woods
jim
spalding
coming
to
take
their
horses
away
to
the
stable
though
a
man
of
no
wild
flights
of
imagination
and
given
to
minding
his
own
business
was
plainly
curious
we
rode
on
ahead
jim
gloria
told
him
and
jim
detected
no
false
note
in
her
gaiety
mamma
is
coming
spalding
gave
them
a
key
and
they
went
to
the
house
it
was
gloria
who
unlocked
the
door
gratton
his
white
face
looking
more
than
ever
bloodless
saw
her
hand
tremble
she
hurried
in
excused
herself
and
ran
upstairs
she
knew
that
the
time
had
come
when
she
would
have
to
listen
to
what
gratton
was
going
to
say
she
knew
what
the
burden
of
his
plea
would
be
she
knew
everything
she
thought
wildly
except
what
her
answer
would
be
she
heard
gratton
stirring
restlessly
downstairs
he
walked
up
and
down
snapping
his
fingers
incessantly
a
habit
which
in
the
man
bespoke
nervousness
he
sat
at
the
piano
and
the
keys
jangled
under
his
touch
he
got
up
and
walked
again
he
was
waiting
for
her
to
come
down
he
was
shaping
in
mind
the
words
which
would
greet
her
before
she
had
come
fairly
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
gloria
turned
into
her
own
room
locking
the
door
behind
her
she
looked
at
herself
in
her
glass
she
was
pale
her
eyes
looked
unnaturally
big
and
brilliant
she
bit
her
lips
and
turned
away
from
her
blouse
she
brought
out
the
parcel
her
father
had
entrusted
to
her
slipping
it
under
her
mattress
smoothing
the
counterpane
when
she
had
done
then
with
but
one
clear
thought
in
the
world
that
of
getting
into
immediate
touch
with
her
mother
she
went
to
the
telephone
on
this
floor
in
a
cosy
little
room
opening
upon
the
upstairs
was
an
extension
telephone
installed
for
the
convenience
of
gloria
and
her
mother
gloria
went
tiptoeing
to
it
rather
than
go
down
where
gratton
was
she
rang
the
necessary
bell
for
the
operator
in
truckee
and
put
in
her
call
in
low
tones
which
demanded
a
repetition
before
the
operator
got
it
right
then
she
sat
with
the
instrument
in
her
hand
waiting
once
she
heard
gratton
step
close
to
the
stairs
and
jumped
to
her
feet
thinking
that
he
was
coming
up
but
he
passed
by
and
the
house
grew
silent
again
she
wondered
when
mark
king
would
come
this
afternoon
spalding
had
said
nothing
she
had
not
mentioned
king
to
spalding
since
she
had
not
mentioned
him
to
gratton
during
the
long
ride
her
telephone
bell
rang
after
the
irritating
way
of
telephones
she
was
put
presently
into
communication
with
gaynor
gloria
gloria
is
that
you
her
mother
voice
sounded
strange
in
gloria
ears
shaken
with
emotion
yes
mamma
i
what
has
happened
child
tell
me
quick
i
am
nearly
dead
with
worry
are
you
all
right
of
course
mamma
i
but
are
you
where
were
you
all
night
are
you
sure
everything
is
all
right
never
had
gloria
known
her
extremely
mother
to
be
so
wildly
disturbed
so
nervously
incoherent
i
have
told
you
i
am
all
right
i
am
up
in
the
mountains
at
our
log
house
did
gratton
tell
you
mr
gratton
gaynor
was
only
more
mystified
he
has
told
me
nothing
i
have
seen
him
i
tried
to
phone
him
oh
i
have
phoned
everybody
we
know
and
he
is
out
of
town
and
but
gloria
by
something
her
mother
had
said
cried
you
have
phoned
oh
mamma
what
do
you
mean
when
you
did
come
in
last
night
i
have
been
crazy
with
worry
i
thought
you
might
be
spending
the
night
with
one
of
your
friends
i
thought
that
maybe
something
had
happened
and
it
was
being
kept
from
me
i
rang
up
georgia
stark
and
mildred
carter
and
the
farrilees
and
even
the
emergency
hospitals
i
thought
the
rest
was
only
a
meaningless
buzzing
in
gloria
ears
she
sat
speechless
herself
bereft
of
all
reason
for
a
dull
moment
then
harbouring
quick
clear
thoughts
as
swift
as
vivid
as
lightning
and
in
the
end
as
blinding
by
their
very
quality
of
blazing
light
newspapers
still
dominated
subconsciously
by
the
thought
which
had
brought
her
to
the
telephone
gloria
managed
before
the
connection
was
broken
to
beg
her
mother
to
come
immediately
to
her
at
the
log
house
to
tell
every
one
that
gloria
was
with
her
father
her
mother
promised
began
asking
questions
and
gloria
said
a
bleak
and
hung
up
she
sat
there
staring
into
space
and
seeing
the
san
francisco
and
hawked
by
newsboys
on
stands
thrust
under
doors
going
like
spreading
snowflakes
of
a
big
storm
into
to
racing
trains
all
over
the
land
her
mother
had
telephoned
the
emergency
hospitals
gloria
could
have
wept
in
rage
screamed
thrown
herself
down
and
given
over
to
paroxysms
of
weeping
but
she
only
sat
on
her
face
whiter
and
whiter
looking
into
emptiness
and
seeing
headlines
that
towered
as
high
as
immense
black
cliffs
her
mother
had
telephoned
mildred
carter
that
hateful
hateful
mildred
carter
had
confessed
that
gloria
had
gone
out
with
gratton
was
gone
all
night
no
one
knew
where
mildred
carter
who
was
as
good
as
married
to
bob
dwight
of
the
and
the
emergency
hospitals
gloria
with
never
a
tear
coming
in
her
hour
of
greatest
distress
sat
rocking
back
and
forth
on
her
chair
crying
oh
i
wish
i
were
dead
as
one
hears
noises
through
a
dream
long
powerless
to
connect
them
logically
with
familiar
happenings
so
now
did
gloria
absently
hearken
to
gratton
calling
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
jumped
up
only
when
she
heard
him
start
to
mount
them
then
galvanized
she
sprang
to
her
feet
cried
to
him
i
be
down
in
just
a
second
and
ran
to
her
room
she
stood
again
looking
at
herself
in
her
glass
gloria
gaynor
she
heard
her
own
pale
lips
say
you
have
gotten
yourself
into
a
nasty
nasty
mess
the
lips
began
to
tremble
then
with
a
great
struggle
for
they
steadied
and
said
gloria
in
a
cold
harsh
little
voice
it
up
to
you
and
no
one
else
to
get
out
the
best
you
can
this
time
she
bathed
her
face
and
hands
she
rubbed
her
cheeks
with
a
towel
determined
to
bring
some
vestige
of
colour
back
she
took
down
her
hair
only
then
so
distrait
was
gloria
did
she
think
of
changing
from
her
boyish
suit
into
a
house
dress
her
eyes
which
had
harboured
only
bewilderment
and
terror
now
grew
speculative
she
brought
from
her
closet
half
a
dozen
dresses
chose
a
certain
pink
one
without
analysing
the
reasons
of
her
selection
found
silk
stockings
and
pumps
and
dressed
from
top
to
toe
she
would
have
to
have
it
out
with
gratton
one
way
or
the
other
she
began
to
know
which
way
it
would
be
but
always
a
girl
should
be
at
her
best
also
she
decided
by
the
time
that
she
was
becomingly
gowned
and
her
hair
arranged
tastefully
it
was
as
well
to
let
gratton
wait
for
her
a
while
waiting
always
to
some
extent
brought
to
the
one
cooling
his
heels
a
sense
of
disadvantage
in
short
gloria
had
gone
through
the
most
panicky
of
her
moments
and
was
getting
a
grip
on
herself
again
when
after
gratton
had
waited
and
fumed
for
upward
of
an
hour
she
went
downstairs
she
looked
cool
and
pretty
and
quite
unembarrassed
he
flashed
a
look
at
her
that
was
eloquent
of
nervous
excitement
i
want
to
explain
everything
to
you
gloria
it
will
take
a
good
deal
of
explaining
wo
it
mr
gratton
they
went
into
the
and
gloria
sat
in
a
big
chair
while
he
stood
before
her
his
fingers
tapping
and
tapping
at
his
you
while
i
talked
with
mamma
did
you
she
said
carelessly
no
said
gratton
but
so
promptly
that
she
knew
he
lied
well
she
said
indifferently
suppose
we
have
the
explanations
now
i
am
sure
that
they
will
prove
interesting
i
am
afraid
he
began
talking
swiftly
that
i
have
been
instrumental
in
placing
you
in
a
false
position
last
night
i
told
you
i
had
telephoned
to
your
mother
i
did
try
they
reported
the
line
out
of
order
what
could
i
do
i
did
want
to
alarm
you
it
was
only
a
lark
i
meant
innocently
you
know
that
do
you
gloria
did
you
she
said
and
managed
to
keep
her
lips
smiling
it
is
only
since
coming
here
that
i
have
realized
how
things
will
look
what
people
will
think
and
say
curse
them
our
being
out
so
long
together
my
buying
clothing
for
you
our
being
registered
as
and
gratton
his
eyes
burned
his
lips
clamped
tight
forgive
me
gloria
it
was
the
mad
impulse
of
a
moment
i
thought
as
we
went
in
that
it
would
look
strange
a
young
unmarried
couple
that
if
i
put
down
man
and
wife
no
one
would
think
anything
at
all
and
we
be
gone
in
a
few
hours
and
probably
you
never
go
back
there
and
no
one
would
know
who
you
were
i
see
gloria
tone
devoid
of
expression
gave
no
clue
to
her
racing
thoughts
you
did
that
for
my
sake
yes
he
said
eagerly
as
i
would
do
anything
on
earth
for
your
sake
you
know
that
gloria
you
know
and
have
known
for
a
long
time
always
that
i
love
you
i
was
going
to
ask
you
soon
to
to
marry
me
gloria
and
now
now
you
will
marry
me
wo
you
yes
but
gloria
did
not
say
it
aloud
not
yet
she
merely
made
it
perfectly
clear
to
miss
gloria
gaynor
that
she
was
going
to
marry
gratton
and
that
there
was
to
be
no
further
question
of
it
and
oh
god
at
this
fateful
moment
how
she
hated
him
how
she
loathed
and
detested
him
while
a
week
ago
yesterday
she
had
wondered
dreamily
if
she
were
in
love
with
him
but
that
was
when
he
was
in
the
city
at
home
in
his
own
wilderness
but
now
she
was
in
a
trap
this
man
had
made
it
cunningly
using
in
his
work
all
that
he
knew
of
gloria
gaynor
there
was
no
way
out
save
through
the
gate
of
matrimony
and
in
her
heart
she
laughed
at
him
through
that
other
wider
gate
beyond
the
gate
of
divorce
she
would
accept
his
name
the
name
of
gratton
stood
high
in
san
francisco
then
she
would
tell
him
how
she
loathed
him
she
would
laugh
at
him
for
physically
she
had
no
fear
of
him
and
he
would
never
have
her
for
his
own
despite
all
of
his
money
and
his
position
and
his
hideous
trickery
gratton
with
all
of
his
shrewdness
had
not
taken
into
consideration
one
thing
how
in
the
city
on
his
native
heath
he
attracted
gloria
how
in
the
woods
he
impressed
her
in
his
unbecoming
outdoor
togs
as
contemptible
you
know
how
i
love
you
he
was
repeating
and
he
was
sincere
she
saw
that
in
his
eyes
in
the
unaccustomed
colour
in
his
face
he
loved
her
as
such
an
unclean
animal
could
love
oh
how
he
sickened
her
will
you
marry
me
gloria
will
you
forgive
me
for
having
however
unintentionally
placed
you
in
a
wrong
light
will
you
give
me
the
right
to
protect
you
to
defend
your
good
name
oh
gloria
strange
that
the
man
had
never
revolted
her
as
he
did
now
she
wanted
to
get
up
and
run
from
him
meantime
she
was
telling
herself
almost
calmly
yes
you
marry
him
the
little
beast
she
did
get
to
her
feet
he
followed
her
into
the
hall
let
me
be
alone
for
a
little
while
she
said
quietly
she
went
to
the
stairway
i
am
going
upstairs
wait
here
for
me
you
will
come
to
me
you
will
marry
me
i
think
so
do
she
cried
sharply
as
he
moved
to
come
to
her
wait
he
swallowed
nervously
i
i
hoped
you
would
and
i
saw
how
terribly
the
events
of
the
last
few
hours
might
be
misconstrued
so
gloria
daring
to
hope
i
sent
word
for
a
justice
of
the
peace
he
will
be
here
this
afternoon
or
this
evening
justice
of
the
peace
gloria
nerves
jangled
loose
in
her
irrepressible
laughter
we
have
a
priest
later
of
course
he
ran
on
hurriedly
but
i
could
arrange
for
one
so
soon
gloria
went
slowly
upstairs
walking
backward
looking
down
on
him
with
unfathomable
eyes
tell
me
gloria
i
promise
not
to
come
near
you
until
you
say
i
may
is
it
yes
said
gloria
and
was
gone
in
a
flash
turning
running
up
and
out
of
sight
he
stood
looking
after
her
tapping
and
tapping
at
his
to
gloria
the
sluggish
moments
were
fraught
with
despondency
or
pulsating
terror
all
arrangements
were
made
she
was
powerless
in
a
trap
a
justice
was
coming
she
was
going
to
marry
gratton
she
lay
on
her
bed
with
her
door
bolted
and
wept
bitterly
moaning
over
and
over
oh
i
wish
i
were
dead
she
heard
gratton
stirring
restlessly
downstairs
she
herself
grew
restless
she
sprang
up
tiptoed
to
her
door
and
slipped
out
as
silent
as
a
shadow
she
went
into
the
little
room
where
the
telephone
was
and
through
it
to
the
for
a
long
time
she
stood
looking
out
across
the
mountains
her
hand
pressed
to
lips
which
trembled
she
thought
of
her
mother
who
coming
as
fast
as
she
could
no
doubt
by
automobile
since
she
would
not
have
the
patience
for
trains
would
not
arrive
before
morning
a
night
here
alone
worse
than
alone
but
great
as
was
the
emotional
tension
lusty
and
now
wearied
youth
must
be
served
she
had
danced
and
ridden
all
through
the
night
she
had
not
had
over
an
hour
or
so
of
broken
sleep
she
had
been
going
all
day
she
dropped
to
sleep
on
the
on
the
porch
it
was
so
very
silent
all
about
her
the
shadows
were
creeping
creeping
among
the
pines
she
awoke
with
a
start
it
was
quite
dark
the
first
stars
burned
with
steadily
growing
brilliancy
some
one
was
standing
above
her
looking
down
at
her
she
could
see
only
the
vague
outline
gloria
a
little
cry
of
fear
broke
from
her
gloria
pleaded
gratton
do
you
know
i
would
i
be
down
in
a
minute
she
told
him
drawing
as
far
away
as
she
could
speaking
with
nervous
haste
go
down
please
wait
for
me
the
justice
is
downstairs
he
said
his
own
voice
agitated
despite
his
effort
for
mastery
are
you
ready
yes
yes
in
a
minute
i
be
down
go
please
go
he
hesitated
she
could
have
screamed
at
him
but
presently
he
began
withdrawing
slowly
hideously
slowly
when
you
are
ready
and
he
has
a
long
ride
back
gloria
we
should
not
keep
him
waiting
she
watched
until
he
had
gone
then
she
crouched
staring
with
wide
unseeing
eyes
into
the
outside
dark
the
man
would
go
right
away
she
would
not
have
even
him
to
mitigate
the
horrible
condition
of
aloneness
with
gratton
i
wo
marry
him
she
cried
out
i
wo
i
hate
him
he
is
a
beast
and
i
wo
there
was
after
all
nothing
to
force
her
nothing
save
that
she
had
been
away
all
this
time
with
gratton
that
he
had
bought
clothing
for
her
that
he
had
registered
himself
and
wife
the
she
heard
a
door
slam
and
sprang
up
if
the
justice
went
away
now
without
marrying
them
she
marry
him
why
if
he
had
been
of
a
notion
to
demur
she
would
have
made
him
marry
her
i
ca
think
clearly
i
wonder
if
i
am
insane
she
went
with
heavy
leaden
steps
back
to
her
room
a
pale
weary
face
looked
at
her
from
her
glass
she
began
arranging
her
hair
her
fingers
with
wills
of
their
own
refused
to
obey
her
own
command
laid
upon
them
she
sought
wildly
to
delay
delay
to
the
last
fragment
of
the
last
second
before
yielding
to
the
inevitable
she
wanted
to
loiter
over
her
hair
and
her
fingers
raced
she
could
hear
voices
downstairs
gratton
voice
low
and
urgent
a
thin
querulous
voice
she
shuddered
that
would
be
the
justice
another
voice
a
man
and
strange
to
her
he
said
nothing
but
twice
she
heard
him
laugh
a
laugh
that
jarred
upon
her
nerves
she
guessed
who
he
would
be
the
man
gratton
had
sent
to
bring
the
justice
gloria
gratton
was
calling
from
the
foot
of
the
steps
the
voice
that
answered
for
her
was
clear
and
steady
and
downstairs
must
have
sounded
untroubled
i
coming
just
a
minute
two
hours
ago
while
gloria
had
been
watching
the
shadows
creeping
among
the
pines
mark
king
had
arrived
he
had
come
down
the
ridge
from
the
rear
and
thus
to
the
outbuilding
by
the
stable
which
housed
the
caretaker
old
jim
spalding
hello
mark
jim
had
said
a
trifle
startled
by
king
sudden
appearance
here
you
come
again
like
a
injun
the
woods
jim
was
smoking
his
pipe
on
his
bench
king
paused
saying
hello
jim
has
ben
showed
up
yet
no
he
ai
showed
mark
expectin
him
yes
who
in
the
house
then
why

of

girl
for
one
and
that
city
guy
gratton
for
another
she
did
say
anything
about

comin
she
did
say
though
the
missis
would
be
along
pretty
soon
gloria
and
gratton
here
king
frowned
he
had
had
ample
time
during
the
long
weeks
since
the
twelfth
of
august
to
decide
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
gloria
gaynor
and
now
she
was
here
with
gratton
he
turned
into
jim
quarters
he
had
no
desire
or
at
least
so
he
told
himself
very
emphatically
to
see
either
one
of
them
i
hit
the
trail
hard
jim
he
said
as
jim
followed
him
and
king
closed
the
door
and
i
dead
tired
and
as
hungry
as
a
bear
what
shape
the
cupboard
in
fine
returned
spalding
hospitably
you
know
me
mark
so
it
happened
that
while
gloria
fought
her
losing
battle
all
alone
mark
king
sat
at
spalding
table
not
a
hundred
yards
away
and
made
a
silent
meal
of
coffee
and
bread
of
jim
crude
baking
and
a
dubious
stew
thereafter
king
threw
himself
down
on
jim
bunk
and
the
two
smoked
their
pipes
with
nothing
in
particular
to
be
said
virtually
nothing
was
said
need
tell
anybody
i
here
jim
king
was
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
i
have
any
business
with
the
folks
in
there
but
keep
your
eye
peeled
for
ben
will
you
the
minute
he
comes
i
want
to
see
him
maybe
suggested
spalding
his
girl
brought
word
no
ben
is
in
coloma
gratton
and
miss
gaynor
and
gaynor
would
have
come
up
from
the
city
you
know
that
means
they
would
have
come
through
placerville
or
truckee
guess
so
agreed
spalding
that
right
i
set
outside
where
i
can
watch
for
ben
goin
to
take
a
snooze
yes
and
after
lying
ten
minutes
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
above
him
king
went
to
sleep
must
of
been
goin
some
meditated
the
man
who
was
once
more
on
his
bench
outside
the
door
king
looks
tuckered
he
sat
through
the
thickening
shadows
watching
the
stars
come
trooping
into
the
darkening
sky
hearkening
to
the
night
breeze
among
the
trees
and
the
thin
singing
noises
of
insects
an
hour
or
so
later
he
heard
horses
that
would
be
ben
now
was
his
first
thought
his
second
was
that
it
might
be
some
one
else
and
that
there
was
no
sense
waking
a
tired
man
for
nothing
so
he
went
down
toward
the
house
he
saw
two
men
dismount
and
tie
their
horses
he
saw
the
door
open
and
gratton
come
out
the
horsemen
went
up
to
the
porch
neither
was
ben
gaynor
one
as
he
passed
in
through
the
doorway
was
a
little
grey
man
whom
jim
had
never
seen
before
the
other
man
it
happened
he
knew
rather
well
by
sight
and
reputation
a
scalawag
as
jim
catalogued
him
name
of
steve
jarrold
the
door
closed
after
them
and
jim
went
back
to
his
bench
in
the
house
they
were
waiting
for
gloria
the
little
grey
man
whom
they
called
judge
and
who
had
a
way
of
clearing
his
throat
before
and
after
the
most
trifling
remark
went
up
and
down
with
his
hands
under
his
peering
at
pictures
and
books
and
quite
a
tidy
little
place
ben
gaynor
got
here
he
said
patronizingly
quite
a
tidy
little
place
gratton
paced
back
and
forth
whirling
always
abreast
of
the
stairs
looking
up
expectantly
steve
jarrold
the
man
whom
gloria
had
heard
laugh
never
budged
from
the
spot
where
he
had
landed
when
entering
the
his
wide
spraddled
legs
seemed
rooted
through
the
big
feet
into
the
floor
and
bony
with
startlingly
black
restless
eyes
and
a
three
or
four
days
growth
of
wiry
beard
no
less
lustrously
black
he
was
ragged
unkempt
and
unthinkably
dirty
his
eyes
roved
all
about
the
room
they
came
back
to
gratton
sped
up
the
steps
came
back
to
gratton
with
a
leer
in
them
and
all
the
while
he
turned
and
turned
his
black
dusty
hat
like
a
man
doing
a
job
he
was
being
paid
for
at
last
since
no
delay
holds
back
for
ever
the
rolling
of
the
great
wheels
of
time
gloria
came
slowly
she
descended
the
stairs
one
hand
at
her
breast
one
gripping
the
banister
her
pallor
was
so
great
that
her
lips
though
pale
also
looked
unnaturally
red
in
contrast
they
were
just
a
little
apart
she
seemed
to
breathe
with
difficulty
her
eyes
glancing
wildly
about
the
room
and
at
the
men
to
be
seen
in
the
hallway
were
the
eyes
of
one
in
a
trap
seeking
frantically
for
escape
knowing
that
there
was
no
escape
her
brain
like
one
in
a
fever
was
quick
to
impressions
alive
with
broken
fragments
of
thought
like
so
many
flashes
of
light
she
noted
trifles
she
saw
a
painting
over
gratton
head
a
seascape
her
father
had
given
her
for
her
fourteenth
birthday
she
saw
three
pairs
of
eyes
staring
at
her
men
eyes
to
her
the
eyes
of
wild
animals
she
read
as
clearly
as
if
their
messages
had
been
in
large
printed
letters
what
lay
in
the
mind
of
each
in
the
little
grey
man
the
judge
speculation
in
steve
jarrold
the
jeers
of
a
man
of
jarrold
type
at
such
a
moment
when
they
fall
upon
the
bride
in
gratton
quickened
desire
of
her
and
triumphant
cunning
my
dear
said
gratton
coming
forward
as
though
to
meet
her
and
then
pausing
abruptly
and
holding
back
this
is
judge
judge
summerling
he
will
perform
the
ceremony
you
know
and
this
is
jarrold
he
brought
the
judge
and
will
be
a
witness
gloria
from
the
last
step
regarded
the
three
men
as
a
prisoner
might
have
looked
upon
jailers
coming
to
drag
her
to
execution
her
lips
moved
but
no
sound
issued
judge
summerling
bowed
stiffly
and
cleared
his
throat
steve
jarrold
hat
ceased
revolving
an
instant
then
fairly
spun
as
though
to
make
up
for
lost
time
suddenly
gloria
began
to
laugh
hysterically
uncontrollably
gratton
whipped
back
and
stared
at
her
summerling
and
jarrold
were
mystified
she
looked
so
little
like
laughter
and
as
both
had
cause
to
regard
the
situation
there
was
so
little
call
for
laughter
but
they
could
have
no
clue
to
gloria
thoughts
her
wedding
with
that
insignificant
little
grey
man
in
his
cheap
wrinkled
clothes
to
officiate
with
that
unshaven
leering
dirty
man
to
witness
holy
matrimony
gloria
gaynor
wedding
she
was
near
madness
with
the
hideous
cruel
travesty
of
such
weddings
as
are
dear
to
the
hearts
of
san
francisco
society
girls
the
judge
was
clearing
his
throat
again
she
looked
at
him
curiously
with
the
odd
sensation
that
while
gloria
gaynor
was
asleep
drugged
into
a
deep
stupor
there
was
within
her
another
gloria
who
took
a
keen
interest
in
the
smallest
happenings
this
affair
ai
any
more
regular
than
it
ought
to
be
he
was
saying
now
just
the
matter
of
the
licence
gratton
jerked
about
and
glared
at
him
the
judge
broke
off
with
a
vehement
clearing
of
his
throat
in
a
moment
he
spoke
again
seein
as
both
parties
to
get
married
he
said
hastily
and
as
circumstances
is
what
they
is
keepin
in
mind
how
circumstances
does
alter
cases
well
then
are
you
ready
that
are
you
ready
seemed
to
explode
like
a
pistol
shot
in
ears
something
within
her
shrieked
no
no
no
gratton
had
said
a
quiet
yes
and
was
looking
at
her
she
heard
herself
saying
faintly
yes
gratton
put
out
his
hand
as
though
to
help
her
down
the
last
step
she
made
a
little
gesture
motioning
him
back
he
bit
at
his
lip
and
obeyed
though
with
a
quick
flash
of
the
eyes
gloria
looked
down
at
the
step
about
six
inches
high
and
yet
and
yet
where
she
stood
was
as
high
as
heaven
down
there
as
deep
as
hell
she
seemed
powerless
to
achieve
that
last
step
but
gratton
was
stirring
restlessly
he
would
put
out
his
hand
again
to
help
her
she
shuddered
and
moved
quickly
now
she
stood
on
the
same
level
as
gratton
and
the
others
the
physical
fact
was
sinister
as
though
symbolical
of
the
psychical
the
judge
began
to
grow
vastly
businesslike
he
must
have
the
full
names
correctly
ages
birthplaces
gratton
answered
for
himself
and
for
gloria
who
stood
now
with
her
hand
on
the
back
of
a
chair
just
within
the
door
across
the
room
was
the
fireplace
over
it
an
ornamental
mirror
she
wondered
dully
what
she
looked
like
the
bride
but
from
where
she
stood
she
could
see
only
the
reflection
of
the
window
across
the
room
the
strip
of
curtain
at
the
side
stirring
softly
in
the
evening
breeze
that
breeze
came
down
through
the
pines
it
wandered
free
why
could
she
gloria
be
like
that
she
thought
poignantly
of
her
few
days
among
the
pines
with
mark
king
oh
the
remembered
glory
of
it
the
clean
sweet
freedom
of
it
now
folks
if
you
ready
stand
side
by
side
oh
cried
gloria
eh
what
that
demanded
the
judge
she
tried
to
smile
i
i
think
she
saw
steve
jarrold
leering
the
witness
she
said
wildly
there
is
only
one
and
it
usual
to
have
two
anyhow
admitted
the
judge
but
being
as
things
a
bit
irregular
and
everything
why
we
make
one
do
there
jim
said
gloria
she
did
not
look
toward
gratton
but
he
understood
that
she
addressed
him
jim
spalding
i
feel
better
if
some
one
i
knew
if
you
get
jim
to
come
please
she
knew
that
she
did
not
care
whether
jim
spalding
came
or
did
not
come
that
she
was
fighting
for
delay
and
could
not
help
snatching
at
any
straw
though
she
knew
that
in
the
end
she
would
go
down
overwhelmed
by
circumstance
circumstance
and
gratton
gratton
also
knew
and
frowned
gloria
he
said
smoothly
that
is
necessary
is
it
yes
it
is
she
flared
out
at
him
hotly
go
get
him
it
will
take
only
a
minute
gratton
said
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
he
would
see
to
it
that
it
took
no
great
amount
of
time
spalding
on
his
bench
saw
gratton
running
toward
him
you
wanted
in
the
house
a
minute
spalding
he
said
curtly
step
lively
will
you
spalding
not
given
to
stepping
lively
at
other
men
commands
was
slow
in
answering
and
then
spoke
drawlingly
wanted
am
i
well
that
interestin
by
who
i
wonderin
miss
gloria
she
wants
you
right
away
that
different
said
old
jim
getting
to
his
feet
gratton
turned
and
hastened
back
to
the
house
jim
quickening
his
own
pace
as
he
sensed
something
out
of
the
ordinary
the
house
door
stood
open
as
gratton
had
left
it
and
the
two
entered
hastily
jim
looked
from
face
to
face
with
keen
shrewd
eyes
ignored
jarrold
who
said
a
mirthful
evenin
jim
and
turned
to
gloria
for
explanation
miss
gloria
wanted
began
gratton
but
jim
spalding
lifted
a
big
hand
as
though
to
ward
off
the
words
i
here
miss
he
said
when
gloria
white
face
only
stared
at
him
you
ai
sick
are
you
no
jim
i
i
am
going
to
be
married
and
married
jim
looked
incredulous
and
then
puzzled
as
again
his
eyes
went
swiftly
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
three
men
faces
yes
jim
and
i
want
you
to
be
a
witness
jim
flushed
up
and
shifted
uneasily
he
had
never
been
at
a
wedding
he
did
not
know
what
a
witness
had
to
do
and
to
witness
the
wedding
of
miss
gloria
who
had
never
appeared
to
come
down
to
earth
long
enough
to
know
that
there
was
such
a
man
as
jim
spalding
on
the
same
sphere
with
her
he
managed
an
uneasy
yes
and
backed
off
toward
the
door
now
if
you
folks
is
ready
began
the
judge
again
right
now
muttered
jim
you
gettin
married
right
now
yes
said
gloria
wearily
and
to
summerling
i
am
ready
but
i
ai
cried
spalding
he
got
to
the
door
and
started
down
the
hall
wait
a
minute
will
you
gratton
hurried
after
him
his
face
hot
with
rage
while
steve
jarrold
guffawed
loudly
and
then
under
gloria
startled
look
dropped
his
eyes
come
back
here
spalding
commanded
gratton
angrily
whatever
got
to
do
can
wait
a
minute
wait
growled
jim
i
be
back
quick
enough
mark
king
was
awakened
by
old
jim
rushing
into
the
room
lighting
a
lamp
hastily
and
making
a
deal
of
clatter
he
sat
up
demanding
has
ben
come
jim
began
chuckling
after
all
a
wedding
was
a
wedding
and
therefore
a
matter
well
worth
a
man
allowing
himself
to
get
a
bit
excited
from
a
cupboard
he
began
dragging
forth
his
one
and
only
serviceable
suit
of
clothes
dingy
black
shiny
affairs
but
jim
best
he
kicked
off
his
breeches
drew
on
the
black
trousers
and
caught
up
the
coat
no
ben
ai
back
he
grinned
at
king
guess
he
be
surprised
when
he
does
come
his
girl
gettin
herself
married
to
that
city
guy
gratton
right
now
in
the
house
what
king
had
heard
well
enough
but
that
what
broke
from
him
explosively
an
me
i
a
witness
said
old
jim
steve
jarrold
another
they
got
the
preacher
there
an
everything
he
paused
a
moment
and
reflected
with
puckered
brows
what
do
you
think
of
her
marryin
that
swab
now
think
ben
goin
to
be
pleased
kind
of
surprising
ai
it
mark
king
managed
a
laugh
which
escaped
critical
notice
only
because
old
jim
was
only
half
listening
oh
it
been
open
and
shut
all
along
that
she
marry
gratton
he
said
keeping
his
head
down
as
he
drew
a
match
across
the
floor
as
though
to
like
a
pipe
whose
bowl
was
empty
if
it
suits
his
womenfolk
i
guess
ben
will
stand
for
it
by
now
jim
had
drawn
his
coat
on
and
was
back
at
the
door
better
come
along
mark
he
invited
you
do
see
a
weddin
every
day
comin
no
thanks
said
king
he
broke
his
match
between
nervous
fingers
he
raised
his
head
to
watch
jim
go
lord
mark
said
spalding
holding
on
his
heel
a
moment
you
must
of
made
one
day
of
it
you
sure
do
look
tuckered
king
rose
and
went
to
the
door
and
stood
looking
after
the
swiftly
departing
figure
he
saw
the
house
the
windows
bright
with
lights
light
streaming
out
through
the
door
to
the
porch
there
was
gloria
just
there
and
he
had
slept
and
gloria
was
marrying
and
here
was
the
end
of
it
the
end
of
everything
it
dawned
on
him
he
who
had
never
looked
twice
on
a
woman
had
looked
thrice
on
her
and
again
he
the
man
had
found
the
one
woman
and
had
lost
her
he
looked
out
toward
the
house
and
through
its
thick
log
walls
saw
gloria
gloria
as
she
had
come
down
the
stairs
to
him
that
first
day
floating
down
like
a
pink
thistledown
putting
her
two
hands
into
his
looking
up
into
his
eyes
with
eyes
which
he
would
never
forget
he
saw
her
in
the
woods
riding
with
him
by
the
spring
waiting
eagerly
for
the
little
she
so
like
a
bird
herself
crossing
a
stream
on
boulders
she
had
slipped
he
had
caught
her
into
his
arms
close
her
hair
had
blown
across
his
face
he
stood
with
her
on
the
highest
crest
of
a
ridge
the
world
lay
below
them
they
were
alone
in
the
blue
heavens
and
he
loved
her
he
groaned
and
ran
his
hand
across
his
eyes
as
though
to
wipe
the
pictures
out
pictures
which
would
never
pass
away
gloria
was
marrying
gratton
now
he
looked
up
into
the
sky
bright
with
stars
its
great
message
to
him
was
emptiness
the
world
was
empty
life
was
empty
there
was
nothing
simply
because
gloria
had
come
had
laughed
into
his
eyes
and
had
gone
on
she
was
like
the
springtime
which
came
dancing
into
the
mountains
which
softened
them
and
brightened
them
and
laughed
and
passed
on
and
away
she
would
be
laughing
now
into
gratton
eyes
he
would
never
see
her
again
after
other
men
had
loved
and
their
loves
had
crumbled
to
ashes
blown
away
by
the
winds
of
time
but
he
see
her
the
last
time
while
still
she
was
gloria
gaynor
and
not
gratton
wife
he
started
and
hurried
toward
the
house
they
were
waiting
for
jim
and
jim
had
hurried
he
came
to
the
porch
and
with
never
a
board
to
creak
under
his
careful
tread
he
made
his
way
silently
around
to
the
side
of
the
house
there
was
a
window
there
the
shade
was
not
drawn
the
curtains
were
blowing
back
and
forth
he
drew
close
and
stood
watching
he
would
look
at
gloria
one
last
time
turning
away
just
before
the
preacher
said
the
last
words
it
was
like
looking
for
the
last
time
on
a
beloved
face
before
the
sod
fell
he
saw
her
her
back
was
turned
to
him
her
head
was
down
he
watched
her
fingers
moving
nervously
at
her
sides
and
his
brow
contracted
with
a
sudden
access
of
pain
those
fingers
had
touched
his
and
he
had
thrilled
to
the
soft
warm
contact
he
loved
them
better
than
he
loved
life
and
soon
they
would
find
their
way
into
gratton
not
once
did
he
move
his
eyes
from
her
she
did
not
turn
toward
him
but
as
the
judge
began
talking
she
lifted
her
head
and
king
saw
her
throat
her
cheek
how
pale
she
was
though
her
head
was
up
her
slim
body
drooped
like
a
little
wildwood
flower
wilting
so
she
remained
for
what
seemed
a
very
long
time
then
suddenly
he
saw
her
body
stiffen
her
hands
flew
to
her
breast
the
judge
hurrying
along
had
asked
and
do
you
take
this
man
to
be
your
wedded
husband
king
did
not
want
to
hear
the
answer
he
turned
to
go
but
hear
now
he
must
for
though
until
now
responses
had
been
hardly
above
a
murmur
he
heard
gloria
crying
no
and
no
and
king
stopped
like
a
man
paralysed
had
he
gone
mad
then
his
pulses
leaped
and
hammered
gloria
had
cried
a
tremor
shook
him
he
could
no
longer
see
her
but
he
stood
where
he
was
his
senses
keyed
to
hear
a
falling
pin
within
he
is
a
beast
and
i
hate
him
cried
gloria
wildly
he
tried
to
trick
me
and
trap
me
he
tried
to
make
me
marry
him
but
i
wo
i
wo
rather
die
her
voice
died
chokingly
away
and
for
five
seconds
it
was
deathly
still
still
king
did
not
move
he
heard
gratton
exclamation
gratton
hurried
step
the
man
was
excited
was
expostulating
other
voices
the
other
men
had
drawn
aside
amazed
leaving
gratton
a
clear
field
with
his
unwilling
bride
have
you
gone
mad
gloria
king
could
hear
the
words
now
think
what
you
are
saying
i
have
thought
i
hate
you
go
away
let
me
go
gratton
pale
eyes
must
be
ablaze
with
wrath
now
his
tone
told
that
there
no
way
out
for
you
you
got
to
marry
me
i
take
your
hand
off
her
voice
broke
into
a
scream
you
hurting
me
and
now
mark
king
moved
at
last
before
the
last
word
had
done
vibrating
through
the
still
room
he
was
through
the
window
taking
the
shortest
way
gratton
hand
was
on
gloria
shoulder
king
threw
it
off
hurling
the
man
backward
across
the
room
gloria
turned
to
him
mark
she
cried
oh
mark
king
he
put
his
arms
about
her
thinking
that
she
was
going
to
fall
for
an
instant
he
held
her
tight
he
felt
her
heart
beating
as
though
it
would
burst
through
her
bosom
you
wo
let
him
he
moved
with
her
to
a
chair
placed
her
in
it
and
turned
toward
gratton
a
look
like
a
naked
knife
in
his
eyes
by
jings
muttered
old
jim
under
his
breath
by
jings
at
this
the
most
critical
moment
of
her
life
it
would
appear
inevitable
that
gloria
must
bend
every
mental
faculty
to
grappling
with
the
vital
issues
and
yet
as
she
sat
swallowed
up
in
the
big
chair
for
a
space
of
time
she
was
in
a
spell
caught
up
and
whirled
away
from
those
about
her
she
forgot
gratton
with
the
white
angry
face
she
had
no
eyes
for
mark
king
or
for
summerling
steve
jarrold
or
jim
spalding
she
was
thinking
of
another
day
two
years
ago
when
she
and
her
mother
had
been
alone
in
this
room
they
had
been
busied
with
the
last
touches
of
furniture
arrangement
they
had
discussed
locations
for
chairs
and
had
argued
over
pictures
both
tired
out
with
a
day
of
effort
they
had
come
near
tears
in
a
verbal
battle
over
the
best
place
for
the
sole
article
remaining
unplaced
gloria
wanted
it
in
the
hallway
gaynor
pleaded
for
it
over
the
mantel
in
the
finally
it
was
gloria
who
cried
with
sudden
laughter
oh
what
does
it
make
we
getting
silly
over
trifles
have
it
your
way
mamma
trifles
gloria
wondered
if
any
other
act
of
her
life
had
had
the
tremendous
import
of
that
sudden
yielding
to
her
mother
wishes
if
the
mirror
had
been
placed
anywhere
else
in
the
universe
even
by
a
few
inches
removed
from
its
present
would
there
be
a
in
all
the
world
right
now
or
would
her
chair
hold
quite
another
sort
of
person
gratton
if
she
had
not
lifted
her
desperate
eyes
and
seen
mark
king
reflected
at
the
window
how
would
she
have
answered
that
one
final
question
the
judge
propounded
would
she
have
said
yes
or
would
it
have
been
no
she
did
not
know
she
would
never
know
she
had
been
on
the
verge
dizzy
with
profitless
speculation
and
now
only
the
extent
of
one
little
word
stood
between
her
and
an
unthinkable
condition
that
a
whole
life
should
be
steered
down
one
channel
or
another
oh
what
immeasurably
separated
channels
by
one
breath
in
a
word
you
do
answer
a
voice
was
saying
irritably
she
started
they
were
talking
to
her
they
had
been
talking
to
her
and
now
she
realized
that
she
had
heard
voices
across
a
great
distance
and
by
no
means
as
clear
to
her
consciousness
as
the
remembered
voice
of
her
mother
two
years
ago
arguing
for
a
mirror
over
the
fireplace
she
turned
her
eyes
on
gratton
since
obviously
it
was
he
who
insisted
on
an
answer
but
king
spoke
for
her
look
here
gratton
he
said
bluntly
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
is
no
reason
why
miss
gaynor
should
pay
the
least
attention
to
your
effervescings
if
she
does
care
to
she
is
a
free
agent
and
under
no
obligations
to
you
i
ask
your
opinion
when
i
want
it
snapped
gratton
miss
gloria
you
asked
me
something
said
gloria
pardon
me
i
did
hear
her
aloof
reply
disconcerted
him
her
attitude
was
spontaneous
unaffected
and
hence
unconsciously
one
of
polite
indifference
suddenly
gratton
fume
as
he
would
had
become
of
not
the
least
importance
you
said
that
you
would
marry
me
not
a
dozen
minutes
ago
did
i
she
demanded
coolly
are
you
quite
sure
i
said
that
look
here
miss
gloria
it
was
jim
spalding
who
had
been
ill
at
ease
all
along
and
now
had
the
brains
and
perhaps
the
delicacy
to
understand
that
this
was
no
place
for
him
if
you
do
need
me
after
all
go
and
the
rest
of
us
with
you
said
king
if
miss
gaynor
cares
to
talk
things
over
with
gratton
gloria
put
out
her
hand
impulsively
touching
king
arm
stay
please
until
he
goes
king
inclined
his
head
gravely
not
realizing
that
his
body
stiffened
under
her
light
touch
what
about
demanded
the
judge
sharply
am
i
needed
or
i
i
say
not
this
evening
king
dry
voice
answered
him
to
you
that
a
fine
way
to
treat
a
man
cried
summerling
truculently
here
i
ride
all
this
way
in
the
dark
and
without
stoppin
for
so
much
as
supper
here
i
ai
had
a
bite
to
eat
since
and
and
get
out
and
that
hundred
dollars
i
was
to
get
so
fast
how
about
that
think
i
the
man
to
let
folks
trample
on
me
and
maybe
jim
will
give
you
a
at
his
cabin
king
told
him
as
for
your
money
get
it
out
of
gratton
if
he
promised
it
to
you
or
he
added
with
a
flash
of
heat
take
it
out
of
his
hide
for
all
i
care
wait
for
me
outside
summerling
muttered
gratton
have
said
you
wo
be
needed
have
i
just
the
same
i
would
mind
takin
what
comin
to
me
now
man
alive
shouted
gratton
whirling
on
him
have
i
got
enough
on
my
hands
without
you
yelping
at
me
just
the
same
jim
called
king
above
the
incoherent
mouthings
slip
your
arm
through
summerling
and
lead
him
off
with
you
feed
him
if
you
feel
like
it
and
let
him
stick
around
for
a
word
with
gratton
if
he
wants
and
you
steve
jarrold
ben
gaynor
is
here
but
just
the
same
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
neither
you
nor
any
other
of
swen
brodie
hangdogs
is
wanted
in
ben
gaynor
house
out
you
go
jarrold
eyes
slanted
off
to
gratton
then
seeing
himself
ignored
and
forgotten
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
pulled
on
his
hat
and
went
out
behind
him
arm
in
arm
one
smiling
widely
and
the
other
pulling
back
and
still
sputtering
went
jim
and
the
judge
to
all
this
gloria
had
given
scant
attention
the
spell
no
longer
lay
over
her
she
was
keenly
awake
to
the
demands
of
the
present
she
was
thinking
thinking
thinking
it
seemed
that
she
had
walked
on
quicksands
that
a
hand
had
drawn
her
up
and
placed
her
where
she
was
now
with
solid
ground
underfoot
but
that
still
all
about
her
were
quicksands
what
temporary
sense
of
security
was
hers
was
due
to
mark
king
to
his
presence
as
long
as
he
stood
there
where
she
could
put
out
a
hand
and
touch
him
she
could
rest
calmly
assured
of
safety
but
when
he
went
there
remained
gratton
and
his
venom
quicksands
all
about
her
in
which
she
would
be
floundering
at
this
moment
but
for
mark
king
her
heart
was
beating
normally
again
the
pallor
left
her
face
which
became
delicately
flushed
her
eyes
large
and
humid
a
sweet
grey
and
once
more
almost
childlike
eyes
to
remind
a
man
that
here
after
all
was
no
woman
of
the
world
but
only
a
young
girl
rose
to
king
and
met
his
long
and
searchingly
yet
there
was
that
in
their
expression
that
made
him
understand
that
she
was
not
looking
at
him
the
physical
man
so
much
as
through
him
for
the
first
time
in
her
pampered
life
the
day
had
come
when
she
was
face
to
face
with
vital
issues
when
there
was
no
mamma
and
no
papa
to
turn
to
when
there
were
no
shoulders
other
than
her
own
to
feel
the
weight
of
events
she
must
do
her
own
thinking
come
to
her
own
decisions
here
was
no
time
for
a
misstep
the
one
great
step
she
had
already
taken
she
had
cried
no
that
step
could
be
reconsidered
retraced
she
looked
at
gratton
face
and
saw
that
but
now
she
would
not
do
that
she
could
not
in
the
city
seeing
the
two
men
together
she
had
turned
to
gratton
now
here
in
her
father
log
house
in
the
mountains
she
wondered
that
she
could
have
done
so
did
men
change
colour
like
chameleons
shifted
from
one
environment
to
another
or
was
it
she
who
had
been
unstable
she
who
was
the
chameleon
a
queer
sensation
which
had
been
hers
before
and
which
she
was
to
know
more
than
once
in
days
to
follow
mastered
her
it
seemed
that
within
her
coexistent
and
for
ever
in
conflict
there
were
two
glorias
a
girl
who
was
very
young
spoiled
vain
and
selfish
a
girl
who
was
older
who
looked
above
and
beyond
the
confines
of
her
own
self
who
was
warmhearted
and
impulsive
and
could
be
generous
there
was
the
gloria
who
was
the
product
of
her
mother
teaching
and
pampering
there
was
that
other
gloria
who
was
the
true
daughter
of
a
pioneer
stock
a
girl
linked
to
the
city
through
tradition
bound
to
the
outdoors
through
instinct
there
was
the
gloria
who
was
ashamed
of
mark
king
at
a
formal
gathering
in
her
own
home
there
was
the
gloria
who
was
thrilled
to
the
depths
of
her
being
as
in
the
she
knew
a
breathless
moment
in
the
arms
of
mark
king
well
here
were
considerations
to
linger
over
on
an
idle
day
now
without
seeking
for
hidden
springs
there
were
on
the
surface
certain
plain
facts
no
matter
what
she
had
felt
toward
gratton
before
she
detested
him
now
no
matter
what
he
might
have
appeared
in
san
francisco
here
in
his
unaccustomed
garb
he
looked
to
her
puny
shallow
and
contemptible
he
was
as
she
had
told
him
a
beast
he
had
betrayed
her
confidence
he
had
taken
advantage
of
her
headlong
youth
he
had
displayed
to
her
view
the
vileness
within
him
he
loved
her
did
he
so
much
the
better
it
lay
within
her
power
then
to
repay
him
if
only
in
part
for
what
he
had
made
her
suffer
i
repeat
miss
gloria
gratton
was
saying
a
stubborn
look
in
his
eyes
that
you
promised
to
marry
me
you
have
had
a
hard
day
i
realize
there
has
been
much
to
unnerve
you
i
erred
in
haste
perhaps
i
should
have
waited
until
you
had
a
night
rest
but
you
know
why
i
did
not
wait
it
was
for
your
sake
gloria
heard
him
through
with
a
hard
little
smile
nothing
is
further
from
my
intention
gratton
she
told
him
icily
than
to
marry
you
now
or
ever
please
let
us
consider
the
matter
closed
once
and
for
all
his
fingers
worked
nervously
at
his
sides
gloria
chose
the
moment
to
lift
her
eyes
again
fleetingly
to
king
she
wanted
gratton
to
see
she
wanted
to
hurt
him
all
that
she
could
she
looked
back
to
see
him
wince
nor
did
his
quick
contraction
of
the
brows
result
from
her
glance
alone
he
had
seen
the
look
lying
unhidden
in
king
eyes
mark
king
had
for
the
first
time
swept
barriers
aside
and
looked
straight
into
his
own
heart
and
known
that
all
of
the
love
that
was
in
him
to
give
had
been
given
to
gloria
gaynor
he
had
come
from
jim
cabin
to
look
on
her
for
the
last
time
he
was
giving
her
up
and
then
when
he
had
turned
away
rather
than
hear
her
murmur
yes
she
had
cried
out
ringingly
no
the
sod
had
not
fallen
upon
a
beloved
face
death
had
not
entered
the
door
life
was
not
extinguished
where
there
was
life
invariably
there
was
hope
he
had
given
gloria
up
yes
but
she
had
come
back
from
beyond
the
frontier
she
had
come
calling
to
him
he
was
certain
of
nothing
just
now
beyond
the
tremendous
fact
that
wise
or
fool
he
loved
her
he
wanted
her
with
a
want
that
is
greater
than
hunger
or
thirst
or
love
of
man
for
man
or
of
man
for
life
itself
much
of
this
lay
shining
in
his
eyes
for
gratton
to
read
or
for
gloria
i
am
no
boy
to
be
thrown
aside
like
an
old
glove
cried
gratton
beside
himself
shaken
with
jealous
fury
you
have
promised
you
have
loved
me
in
your
heart
you
love
me
now
shall
i
stand
back
for
a
nervous
whim
i
tell
you
you
shall
marry
me
gloria
laughter
cool
and
insolent
maddened
him
he
clenched
his
hands
and
was
swept
away
by
his
passion
to
gusty
vehemence
think
before
you
laugh
what
if
instead
of
doing
the
gentlemanly
thing
i
refused
to
marry
you
alone
with
me
all
this
time
all
last
night
a
clerk
to
swear
i
bought
clothing
for
you
a
register
to
show
where
we
engaged
a
room
as
man
and
wife
the
san
francisco
papers
already
bandying
your
name
about
already
nosing
after
scandal
to
marry
me
there
is
nothing
else
for
you
to
do
gloria
flushed
hotly
but
only
in
anger
this
time
king
mystified
looking
from
one
to
the
other
turned
at
last
to
gloria
and
muttered
for
god
sake
let
me
throw
him
out
of
the
door
i
think
it
might
be
best
first
she
answered
quietly
if
gratton
remained
long
enough
to
understand
that
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
ever
speak
to
him
or
listen
to
a
word
from
him
he
has
tried
to
get
me
into
a
nasty
situation
he
will
do
all
that
he
can
to
promote
scandal
but
i
want
him
to
know
that
he
will
in
the
end
of
it
all
have
my
father
to
reckon
with
and
my
friends
again
she
looked
swiftly
at
king
and
again
gratton
writhed
at
the
look
papa
will
not
be
here
he
is
hurt
and
in
coloma
and
i
give
you
his
message
soon
but
you
saw
your
father
in
coloma
it
was
a
gasp
of
astonishment
from
gratton
you
said
nothing
you
brought
a
message
to
king
here
and
you
escorted
me
and
never
guessed
gloria
taunted
him
really
it
seems
too
bad
after
all
of
your
trips
to
coloma
after
all
of
your
conferences
with
the
estimable
swen
brodie
his
prominent
eyes
bulged
written
large
with
consternation
for
a
moment
he
stood
the
picture
of
uncertainty
plucking
at
his
lip
gloria
he
said
shortly
despite
all
you
have
said
i
shall
see
you
again
when
we
have
both
rested
i
come
to
you
now
if
you
will
pardon
me
i
have
a
word
with
king
strictly
business
you
may
be
sure
king
he
concluded
sarcastically
there
to
be
no
business
between
you
and
me
king
told
him
promptly
but
there
is
if
you
got
two
grains
of
common
sense
look
you
loony
honeycutt
is
dead
at
last
his
secret
is
no
longer
his
secret
swen
brodie
knows
something
a
whole
lot
it
strikes
me
frowned
king
that
you
know
more
of
this
than
i
gave
you
credit
for
where
do
you
come
in
i
know
nearly
all
that
it
is
necessary
to
know
his
eyes
flashed
triumphantly
think
i
the
man
to
let
the
crowd
of
you
lift
a
fortune
right
under
my
nose
here
is
my
proposition
and
you
thank
your
stars
that
i
make
it
we
are
not
friends
you
and
i
but
that
is
no
reason
that
we
can
not
be
business
associates
until
this
trick
is
turned
you
and
i
enter
into
a
pact
right
now
purely
business
you
understand
he
was
speaking
more
and
more
rapidly
in
the
grip
of
a
new
emotion
whatever
we
find
we
divide
king
sudden
laughter
no
pleasant
sound
in
gratton
ears
checked
the
rush
of
words
to
accept
gratton
as
a
partner
on
a
split
of
the
spoils
was
the
man
crazy
i
have
been
working
with
brodie
shouted
gratton
if
i
go
on
with
him
now
with
him
and
the
men
with
him
six
or
eight
of
them
taking
what
he
gives
them
either
in
money
or
in
curses
and
orders
if
i
say
i
chip
in
with
him
against
you
what
will
the
inevitable
end
be
i
ask
you
look
at
the
odds
the
inevitable
end
said
king
sternly
will
be
that
they
pick
your
bones
and
kick
you
out
i
demand
to
know
what
word
gaynor
sent
will
you
have
him
go
mark
said
gloria
he
sickens
me
king
unleashed
by
her
words
took
a
quick
step
forward
gratton
he
said
you
better
go
gratton
rising
to
fresh
fury
shouted
at
him
and
leave
you
and
her
here
alone
all
night
king
bore
down
upon
him
and
struck
him
across
the
mouth
hurling
him
back
so
that
gratton
tripped
and
fell
gloria
rose
and
stood
watching
terrified
and
yet
fascinated
she
saw
gratton
crawl
to
his
feet
his
hand
went
out
to
the
table
to
draw
himself
up
it
found
one
of
the
heavy
bronze
the
fingers
gripped
it
so
that
the
tendons
stood
out
like
cords
she
could
see
the
faces
of
both
men
gratton
twitching
and
vindictive
king
immobile
looking
at
once
calm
and
terribly
stern
if
there
were
two
glorias
within
her
one
of
them
fled
now
the
other
watched
with
quick
bright
eyes
and
gloried
in
the
man
who
had
come
at
her
hour
of
direst
need
one
vanished
afraid
the
other
felt
a
little
thrill
go
singing
through
her
blood
and
though
that
bronze
block
were
it
hurled
at
king
head
might
have
been
the
death
of
him
she
was
not
once
in
doubt
as
to
the
end
of
this
conflict
there
before
her
eyes
a
man
contended
with
a
manikin
drop
that
gratton
do
you
hear
me
drop
it
i
say
he
even
drew
closer
while
he
spoke
in
his
voice
was
assurance
that
he
would
be
obeyed
in
his
look
was
the
promise
of
death
or
to
be
meted
out
swiftly
and
relentlessly
for
disobedience
gratton
like
a
man
in
a
daze
hesitated
king
hand
shot
out
swiftly
gripping
his
wrist
there
was
a
sudden
jerk
and
the
bit
of
bronze
crashed
to
the
floor
you
go
now
yes
i
go
but
on
your
way
then
but
shut
up
a
tremor
not
to
be
repressed
shook
king
voice
and
go
before
i
just
go
gratton
caught
up
his
hat
stood
for
a
moment
plucking
at
his
lip
and
staring
at
gloria
and
then
turned
and
went
out
strangely
only
now
that
he
had
gone
did
gloria
shiver
and
look
after
him
fearfully
the
man
here
had
seemed
so
futile
and
yet
she
had
seen
that
last
look
so
filled
with
malevolence
that
in
his
wake
the
room
seemed
steeped
in
menace
king
must
have
had
somewhat
the
same
sort
of
an
impression
he
went
to
the
door
and
called
out
loudly
jim
oh
jim
jim
voice
answered
from
the
cabin
comin
mark
gratton
outside
i
told
him
to
clear
out
give
him
about
two
minutes
and
if
he
still
here
throw
a
gun
on
him
and
run
him
off
the
place
oh
i
going
fast
enough
from
somewhere
off
in
the
dark
it
was
gratton
voice
calling
back
hatefully
and
do
you
forget
it
mark
king
i
am
going
where
an
offer
like
mine
to
you
will
be
accepted
be
there
before
you
yet
a
dozen
men
that
wo
lay
down
before
you
and
you
can
tell
that
girl
in
there
with
my
compliments
she
be
on
her
knees
to
me
before
she
a
day
older
he
lifted
his
voice
so
that
gloria
shivering
in
the
silent
house
must
hear
every
word
you
can
tell
her
too
that
if
i
did
telephone
to
her
mother
from
oakland
i
did
call
up
two
of
the
san
francisco
newspaper
offices
tell
her
to
watch
for
the
papers
and
when
they
get
wind
of
the
nice
little
situation
gloria
here
all
night
king
had
held
the
door
open
only
to
see
if
gratton
was
going
to
his
horse
now
however
he
slammed
it
suddenly
and
went
back
to
gloria
after
all
jim
could
be
depended
on
to
see
to
gratton
and
to
do
his
job
thoroughly
and
with
joy
in
the
doing
there
was
still
the
message
to
be
had
from
ben
gaynor
who
it
seemed
lay
hurt
somewhere
in
coloma
but
he
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
when
he
saw
gloria
and
for
the
moment
all
thoughts
of
gaynor
or
a
message
fled
from
his
mind
again
she
was
as
pale
as
death
she
caught
at
the
back
of
the
chair
which
had
served
her
thus
before
she
lifted
to
king
eyes
sick
with
terror
i
have
got
the
straight
of
things
very
well
king
said
to
her
speaking
very
gently
for
in
his
heart
he
was
thinking
poor
little
kid
she
only
a
kid
of
a
girl
and
she
pretty
near
the
from
the
look
of
things
and
small
wonder
but
aloud
he
continued
only
one
thing
seems
clear
you
are
tired
half
to
death
and
worried
the
other
half
i
would
let
myself
think
of
that
snake
gratton
or
his
poison
drippings
things
will
work
out
all
right
he
managed
a
smile
of
a
sort
the
first
smile
and
added
they
always
do
you
know
do
they
she
asked
listlessly
and
she
too
forced
a
smile
so
wan
and
bleak
that
it
came
close
to
putting
a
dash
of
tears
into
eyes
for
one
thing
he
said
brusquely
i
bet
you
have
had
a
bite
to
eat
since
you
got
here
have
you
she
shook
her
head
she
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
eating
when
had
she
eaten
last
not
since
she
and
gratton
motoring
up
from
san
francisco
had
stopped
at
the
wayside
perhaps
that
was
why
this
giddy
faintness
troubled
her
why
the
blood
drummed
in
her
ears
you
sit
right
down
commanded
king
or
lie
down
is
better
in
two
shakes
i
have
something
ready
for
you
you
are
so
good
to
me
that
came
straight
from
gloria
heart
her
eyes
shone
with
a
gratitude
which
struck
him
as
far
beyond
proportion
to
the
small
deed
of
the
moment
i
go
upstairs
a
moment
message
it
can
wait
ten
minutes
let
me
get
it
now
i
i
will
lie
down
in
my
room
until
you
call
me
if
you
want
me
to
that
good
he
watched
her
go
slowly
upstairs
and
then
hastened
to
the
kitchen
he
got
a
wood
fire
going
in
the
range
scouted
for
coffee
found
a
glass
jar
of
bacon
a
tin
of
milk
all
kinds
of
canned
goods
and
meantime
though
occupied
with
much
speculation
concerning
all
that
had
happened
and
must
have
happened
before
and
might
happen
in
the
future
he
never
for
an
instant
entirely
forgot
gloria
and
how
pitifully
borne
down
she
looked
gratton
had
tricked
her
some
way
had
coerced
her
had
come
close
to
breaking
her
utterly
and
yet
her
indomitable
spirit
had
in
the
end
triumphed
over
gratton
scheming
king
would
never
forget
how
her
voice
had
rung
out
in
that
fearless
no
no
and
no
and
no
just
a
little
kid
of
a
girl
and
he
had
looked
to
her
for
the
sanity
of
mature
age
a
mere
girl
sheltered
always
by
father
and
mother
spoiled
to
the
degree
given
no
opportunity
to
develop
her
own
character
to
grow
up
to
life
responsibilities
her
mother
had
not
even
told
her
of
her
grandparents
being
ashamed
of
them
making
gloria
ashamed
grandparents
of
whom
any
one
might
be
justly
proud
folk
of
integrity
of
stamina
of
fearless
hardihood
men
and
women
of
that
glorious
type
that
builds
empires
and
gloria
king
sensed
was
like
them
deep
within
her
under
the
layers
of
artificiality
which
her
mother
had
striven
so
indefatigably
and
lovingly
to
lay
on
she
was
like
them
he
remembered
his
two
days
with
her
alone
in
the
mountains
and
sought
to
forget
the
fragment
of
one
evening
in
the
city
here
she
was
her
real
self
there
she
had
been
what
her
mother
had
made
her
over
gloria
with
lagging
steps
had
gone
to
her
room
now
she
lay
on
her
bed
her
hands
pressed
tight
upon
her
closed
eyes
her
will
set
against
heeding
the
throbbing
in
her
temples
as
she
strove
to
think
clearly
gratton
words
rang
in
her
ears
they
plunged
her
into
panic
for
scores
of
friends
and
hundreds
of
acquaintances
she
would
furnish
a
topic
of
talk
girls
who
were
jealous
of
her
would
get
into
a
warm
flurry
of
excitement
gloria
could
picture
a
dozen
of
them
sitting
at
their
telephones
calling
up
this
that
and
the
other
mabel
and
ernestine
saying
oh
did
you
hear
about
gloria
gaynor
is
it
what
she
have
been
thinking
of
i
knew
she
was
and
so
forth
and
so
on
ringing
interminable
changes
youth
though
declared
by
the
thoughtless
to
be
a
period
of
heedlessness
takes
to
heart
far
more
seriously
than
does
age
all
happenings
which
touch
its
own
interests
pure
tragedy
is
youth
own
realm
it
feels
acutely
its
imaginings
are
fearful
it
magnifies
and
distorts
beyond
all
reason
had
gloria
been
above
thirty
instead
of
under
twenty
this
moment
would
have
been
far
far
less
deeply
immersed
in
the
gloom
of
despair
she
suffered
but
youth
condition
of
wedded
extremes
while
it
holds
tragedy
to
its
bleeding
heart
can
not
entirely
fail
in
time
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
hope
gloria
clung
passionately
to
the
one
straw
offered
her
mark
king
had
come
he
had
saved
her
if
only
for
the
moment
if
there
were
further
salvation
it
lay
in
mark
king
and
so
she
came
presently
to
a
thought
that
made
her
sit
bolt
upright
that
set
her
heart
racing
that
brought
a
new
look
into
her
eyes
just
now
it
had
seemed
so
clear
that
only
one
thing
could
save
her
from
clacking
diatribes
from
torture
under
the
tongues
of
ernestines
and
mabels
and
daily
newspapers
marriage
with
gratton
but
gratton
was
gone
and
mark
king
was
here
if
she
married
king
the
judge
was
still
here
king
was
her
friend
between
men
like
them
there
was
nothing
which
would
be
denied
when
friendship
asked
what
if
she
went
to
king
saying
to
him
straightforwardly
thus
and
such
is
my
predicament
for
my
sake
for
the
sake
of
papa
daughter
and
hence
for
papa
sake
no
less
will
you
go
through
the
form
of
marrying
me
i
shall
be
no
burden
it
will
make
no
difference
in
your
life
for
i
will
go
back
to
san
francisco
and
you
need
never
see
me
again
you
can
let
me
have
a
divorce
you
will
have
lost
nothing
i
shall
have
been
saved
everything
will
you
many
me
mark
king
gloria
king
was
calling
will
you
come
down
now
ready
coming
answered
gloria
right
away
she
glanced
in
her
glass
as
she
went
out
the
colour
which
had
played
all
day
was
again
tinting
her
cheeks
a
delicate
rose
what
were
fatigue
and
hunger
when
hope
attended
them
but
it
happened
that
gloria
impulse
which
was
at
least
honest
and
frank
was
for
a
little
held
in
abeyance
and
thus
it
came
about
that
she
lost
the
opportunity
to
appear
before
mark
king
at
a
critical
moment
as
being
direct
and
outspoken
she
thanked
him
with
her
eyes
for
the
lunch
he
had
set
forth
for
her
she
gave
him
a
quick
little
smile
as
he
waited
on
her
he
poured
the
coffee
gave
her
milk
and
sugar
brought
the
hot
things
from
the
stove
and
all
of
the
time
there
was
in
his
eyes
a
look
which
he
had
no
suspicion
was
there
the
look
of
a
man
adoration
he
will
do
whatever
i
ask
him
to
do
something
sang
within
her
wo
you
sit
down
with
me
mark
she
smiled
at
him
and
there
while
one
gloria
had
determined
to
indulge
in
plain
talk
the
other
gloria
came
forward
obliquely
demanding
the
place
which
had
always
been
hers
when
it
was
a
case
of
man
and
girl
together
the
smile
was
the
smile
of
a
coquette
it
intoxicated
it
made
a
man
heart
beat
hard
it
brought
him
in
close
to
her
and
thrust
the
world
back
she
could
not
have
helped
the
smile
or
its
message
i
have
eaten
he
said
a
trifle
harshly
she
thought
you
are
so
good
to
me
she
stirred
her
coffee
and
he
saw
only
the
lashes
and
their
black
shadows
on
her
cheeks
then
she
said
brightly
this
is
our
third
little
picnic
together
is
it
then
you
have
forgotten
the
others
the
words
said
themselves
for
him
the
human
comedy
had
begun
or
the
comedy
begun
long
ago
was
resumed
smoothly
in
its
third
act
king
unconsciously
answering
to
his
cue
after
that
it
was
neither
gloria
nor
himself
who
played
the
part
of
that
responsibility
was
back
in
the
hands
of
the
oldest
of
all
the
wind
that
drives
autumn
leaves
scurrying
the
sun
that
awakens
spring
buds
were
no
more
resistless
or
inevitable
forces
than
the
one
now
voicing
its
dictates
it
would
be
unmaidenly
to
ask
him
to
marry
you
whispered
that
other
self
within
her
oh
if
she
could
only
guess
which
was
the
which
the
pretender
and
there
is
no
need
look
at
his
eyes
king
saw
lying
on
the
table
the
package
done
up
in
an
old
cloth
which
she
had
brought
further
he
knew
that
he
had
seen
it
before
and
where
he
had
seen
it
he
knew
that
at
last
he
had
old
loony
honeycutt
secret
where
he
could
put
out
his
hand
to
it
with
none
to
gainsay
him
he
knew
that
with
it
was
a
message
from
his
old
friend
ben
that
ben
himself
lay
at
this
moment
in
coloma
hurt
and
yet
his
eyes
clung
to
the
eyes
of
gloria
and
all
of
these
things
were
swept
aside
in
his
mind
he
saw
that
when
her
eyes
came
to
a
meeting
with
his
the
flush
in
her
cheeks
grew
hotter
he
tried
to
remember
how
he
had
come
away
from
her
in
san
francisco
how
he
had
given
her
up
for
all
time
but
that
memory
blurred
in
its
place
he
stood
with
her
on
a
boulder
in
a
creek
holding
her
in
his
arms
he
stood
with
her
on
a
mountain
top
with
the
world
lost
below
them
he
sought
to
get
a
grip
on
himself
here
and
now
was
no
time
to
talk
to
her
of
love
she
was
alone
it
was
his
one
job
right
now
to
take
ben
place
to
protect
her
and
efface
his
own
madness
but
was
he
mad
and
was
now
no
time
after
all
she
was
alone
yes
but
if
some
day
she
would
marry
him
was
not
now
the
time
what
would
he
not
give
for
the
right
to
stop
the
nasty
mouth
of
gratton
once
and
for
all
fragmentary
thoughts
by
no
means
logically
aligned
they
came
and
went
with
other
thoughts
between
pro
and
con
but
thoughts
do
not
always
sway
destiny
in
the
crisis
often
enough
there
is
no
time
for
so
slow
a
process
as
thinking
instinct
leaps
instinct
compels
all
of
the
thought
in
the
world
will
not
draw
a
steel
needle
to
a
bit
of
wood
all
of
the
thought
in
the
world
will
not
hold
back
the
same
needle
from
a
magnet
there
are
urges
which
must
be
obeyed
the
urge
of
spinning
worlds
to
circling
suns
the
urge
of
man
to
maid
gloria
he
said
huskily
gloria
yes
mark
she
said
quietly
trying
to
speak
very
calmly
and
as
though
she
did
not
know
oh
so
well
all
that
tumult
that
lay
behind
his
calling
her
name
but
despite
her
determination
she
was
agitated
the
moment
had
come
there
was
no
stopping
it
and
did
she
want
it
what
did
she
want
what
exactly
did
she
feel
she
knew
what
was
in
his
heart
his
soul
exulted
as
the
certainty
rushed
upon
him
she
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
words
were
needless
between
them
and
the
colour
merely
deepened
in
her
cheeks
while
she
hid
her
eyes
from
him
he
came
to
her
swiftly
she
rose
as
swiftly
to
her
feet
he
saw
that
a
tremor
shook
her
he
saw
that
she
did
not
draw
back
from
him
her
eyes
at
last
lifted
to
meet
his
own
they
baffled
him
he
could
not
read
their
meaning
but
they
shone
on
him
softly
they
were
the
eyes
of
her
whom
he
loved
like
magnet
and
steel
they
were
swept
together
he
had
her
in
his
arms
he
felt
against
his
breast
the
wild
flutter
of
her
heart
against
his
face
the
soft
brushing
of
her
hair
he
felt
her
body
tense
but
unresisting
in
his
arms
suddenly
she
relaxed
her
head
was
against
his
breast
gloria
in
his
arms
gloria
sweet
face
hidden
from
him
against
his
rough
shirt
gloria
he
cried
again
gloria
the
the
bacon
gasped
gloria
it
burning
she
freed
herself
and
while
he
let
her
go
he
stood
watching
her
with
the
new
look
in
his
eyes
she
flashed
her
look
at
him
from
across
the
table
then
she
fled
to
the
stove
and
retrieved
the
burning
bacon
as
though
here
were
the
one
matter
of
transcendent
importance
king
began
to
laugh
his
laughter
as
joyous
as
a
boy
gloria
that
five
times
you
said
she
informed
him
hurriedly
and
please
mark
as
he
moved
toward
her
and
you
have
read
papa
letter
yet
and
and
i
dying
to
know
what
is
in
that
funny
package
are
you
if
i
dying
at
all
he
told
her
gravely
though
he
found
a
smile
to
answer
her
own
and
two
very
serious
smiles
they
were
it
is
of
quite
another
complaint
and
this
time
but
mark
i
am
here
all
alone
with
you
and
i
know
i
have
forgotten
but
gloria
they
both
started
to
a
sudden
sound
outside
a
scuffling
on
the
porch
involuntarily
gloria
prone
to
nervous
alarm
in
her
overwrought
condition
moved
hastily
back
toward
him
from
whom
just
now
she
had
escaped
they
glanced
toward
the
sound
they
saw
at
the
window
the
puckered
and
perplexed
face
of
the
judge
they
were
just
in
time
to
see
a
big
hand
grasp
him
by
the
shoulder
and
yank
him
out
of
sight
they
heard
summerling
expostulate
they
heard
jim
spalding
far
from
gentle
voice
cursing
him
king
understood
at
least
in
part
what
must
lie
under
gloria
look
of
distress
surely
circumstance
had
placed
her
in
an
equivocal
position
summerling
was
the
type
to
blab
he
was
in
no
charitable
frame
of
mind
he
had
found
her
alone
here
with
men
had
come
to
marry
her
to
one
man
and
now
had
seen
her
in
the
arms
of
another
there
was
but
one
answer
even
to
mark
king
some
time
you
are
going
to
marry
me
gloria
he
said
gravely
why
not
now
it
sounds
like
like
an
advertisement
mark
she
laughed
somewhat
wildly
poor
little
kid
he
muttered
seeing
how
she
trembled
but
gloria
why
not
some
time
you
are
going
to
give
yourself
to
me
are
you
dear
while
this
man
is
still
here
wo
you
let
him
marry
us
it
will
give
me
the
right
to
shut
that
fool
gratton
mouth
for
him
and
oh
gloria
my
dear
my
dear
she
stood
staring
at
him
with
wide
eyes
he
pleaded
with
her
will
you
gloria
and
then
from
lips
which
did
not
smile
he
heard
the
very
faint
but
no
longer
evasive
yes
now
gloria
yes
mark
if
you
are
sure
that
you
want
me
she
spoke
humbly
at
the
instant
she
was
humble
but
she
added
hastily
still
you
read
poor
papa
letter
he
was
very
anxious
let
me
go
a
minute
mark
i
am
going
upstairs
i
i
want
to
phone
to
mamma
first
and
while
i
am
gone
you
can
read
papa
letter
and
and
her
face
was
hot
with
blushes
and
arrange
with
the
judge
he
said
his
own
voice
uncertain
yes
gloria
she
ran
by
him
then
he
heard
her
going
upstairs
he
heard
a
door
closing
after
her
then
like
a
man
who
treads
on
air
he
went
to
the
window
and
threw
it
up
and
called
jim
tell
the
judge
not
to
go
i
have
business
with
him
i
want
him
and
you
here
in
ten
minutes
and
then
when
jim
voice
had
answered
him
he
thought
to
take
up
the
parcel
on
the
table
largely
because
gloria
had
asked
him
a
hurried
letter
from
ben
and
the
parcel
from
honeycutt
something
here
for
which
he
had
been
seeking
working
for
years
remembered
now
only
because
gloria
had
made
the
request
that
they
be
not
forgotten
to
withdraw
his
racing
thoughts
from
gloria
and
her
golden
promise
to
bend
them
to
a
letter
this
was
in
the
beginning
an
effort
but
words
caught
him
when
he
had
read
the
first
line
he
had
opened
the
packet
ripping
off
the
old
encasement
of
cloth
there
was
a
book
a
bible
that
looked
to
be
centuries
old
battered
the
covers
gone
gaynor
letter
was
slipped
into
it
dear
mark
honeycutt
dead
i
got
his
secret
but
brodie
came
near
doing
me
in
honeycutt
dying
sent
for
me
i
got
there
just
in
time
he
gave
me
the
bible
it
was
the
parson
and
then
gus
ingle
as
i
was
going
out
of
the
cabin
brodie
and
two
of
his
gang
swooped
down
on
me
in
the
dark
i
pitched
the
bible
clear
and
they
did
not
see
it
was
just
that
near
they
came
close
to
killing
me
when
i
came
to
i
found
they
been
through
my
pockets
i
do
know
how
much
brodie
knows
i
do
know
he
is
working
with
gratton
the
dirty
crook
i
think
you
can
beat
them
to
it
hands
down
and
for
god
sake
mark
and
for
my
sake
if
not
for
your
own
do
let
the
grass
grow
i
am
on
the
edge
of
absolute
bankruptcy
laid
up
this
way
i
do
see
a
chance
unless
you
find
what
we
been
after
so
long
find
it
will
you
start
without
any
delay
as
soon
as
you
get
this
phone
to
charlie
marsh
at
coloma
leave
word
for
me
and
let
that
word
be
that
nothing
on
earth
will
stop
you
then
i
wo
go
crazy
here
with
worry
and
watch
out
for
gratton
as
well
as
brodie
ben
a
bit
of
the
old
interest
swept
back
over
king
as
he
read
the
old
excitement
raced
through
his
blood
he
dropped
ben
note
into
the
stove
and
eagerly
took
up
the
old
bible
there
on
the
blank
pages
written
in
a
crabbed
hand
long
ago
at
times
letters
blurred
out
but
always
a
trace
left
where
the
unaccustomed
scribe
had
borne
down
hard
in
his
painful
labourings
was
the
secret
at
last
gus
ingle
message
come
to
him
across
the
dead
years
good
god
i
never
see
such
gold
nor
no
man
neither
and
when
he
come
in
to
camp
you
could
reed
in
his
look
he
had
found
it
because
no
man
could
have
looked
at
that
mother
load
and
not
look
like
jimmy
and
big
brodie
grabbed
him
by
the
throat
and
shook
him
and
nearly
killed
him
until
jimmy
told
and
i
guess
there
was
enough
there
for
everybody
in
all
the
world
we
went
down
the
gorge
to
the
narrow
place
over
on
the
big
seedar
that
had
broke
off
and
that
was
how
we
come
to
the
first
caive
and
then
we
come
to
caive
number
thre
and
two
and
good
god
have
mercy
on
my
soul
when
ime
dead
but
i
got
the
thought
right
then
if
it
was
only
all
mine
we
worked
all
seven
until
we
dropped
that
day
and
night
and
early
in
the
morning
and
the
storm
was
coming
but
we
stayed
and
for
two
weeks
maybe
thre
we
lost
track
of
time
until
this
grate
big
pile
of
gold
was
dug
that
i
am
setting
right
on
top
of
right
now
how
can
a
man
eat
gold
when
he
is
dying
of
hunger
and
burn
it
when
he
is
freezing
and
it
was
big
brodie
killed
pore
manny
i
seen
him
and
the
next
day
or
maybe
it
was
two
days
dago
was
gone
and
never
come
back
was
it
manny
goast
got
him
and
drug
him
down
the
cliffs
screaming
horrible
and
in
the
gorge
anyway
that
was
two
and
i
am
all
that
is
left
and
i
am
going
i
tride
to
get
out
and
the
big
storm
drov
me
back
and
all
i
can
see
is
jimmy
kelp
and
the
parson
if
i
had
not
of
killed
them
they
would
killed
me
sure
and
big
brodie
gone
he
is
crazy
and
cant
never
make
it
back
across
the
mountains
in
this
storm
and
baldy
winch
he
took
a
big
nugget
and
went
off
and
he
stoled
what
handful
of
grub
there
was
and
now
i
can
look
down
in
the
gorge
and
see
the
water
all
white
and
snow
and
ice
sickles
and
i
am
afraide
to
get
lost
in
the
caives
and
if
i
write
all
this
in
the
bible
that
was
preacher
elsons
and
tie
it
up
safe
in
oilcloath
and
canvas
and
make
a
bote
out
of
a
chunk
of
wood
and
throw
it
in
the
river
maybe
it
will
get
to
one
of
the
camps
down
there
and
a
good
man
will
find
it
and
ile
give
him
half
you
come
up
the
old
trail
past
where
the
thre
eytalians
had
their
camp
last
year
and
over
the
big
mountain
strate
ahead
and
about
another
seven
miles
strate
on
and
then
there
is
the
pass
with
the
big
black
rocks
on
one
side
and
streaks
of
white
granite
on
the
other
and
down
into
the
gorge
and
strate
up
four
or
five
miles
where
the
old
seedar
broke
off
and
fell
acrost
my
god
here
goes
gus
ingle
to
any
man
who
knew
the
sierra
hereabouts
less
intimately
than
did
mark
king
gus
ingle
message
would
have
brought
only
stupefaction
but
to
king
now
as
to
ben
gaynor
before
him
the
secret
lay
bare
old
names
held
on
the
three
italians
had
given
a
name
to
what
was
now
known
as
italy
gulch
the
caves
were
on
a
certain
fork
of
the
american
river
then
and
king
had
approximately
the
distances
and
direction
what
is
more
he
thought
triumphantly
i
know
where
two
caves
are
in
there
but
where
the
devil
is
thre
here
he
started
up
and
thrust
the
old
bible
into
his
shirt
there
were
steps
on
the
porch
jim
and
the
judge
were
coming
it
strikes
me
said
summerling
sarcastically
that
there
mighty
funny
here
i
show
up
to
marry
one
man
to
a
girl
and
nex
thing
i
know
i
peek
in
a
winder
and
see
never
mind
that
cut
in
king
hastily
you
are
going
to
marry
her
after
all
only
to
another
man
meanin
you
mark
demanded
jim
on
his
honest
old
face
was
a
look
of
utter
bewilderment
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
decide
whether
he
or
every
one
else
had
gone
crazy
king
flushed
under
the
look
but
nodded
and
managed
a
calm
yes
jim
summerling
cleared
his
throat
and
thereafter
scratched
his
head
it
irregular
i
told
gratton
that
but
he
said
there
was
was
extenuatin
circumstances
and
all
that
had
been
time
for
a
licence
it
irregular
do
know
as
i
might
get
in
trouble
for
it
the
marriage
would
be
binding
would
it
demanded
king
sure
it
would
once
i
said
and
wife
nary
man
could
set
aside
but
if
any
one
wanted
to
get
in
bad
seeing
there
no
licence
well
it
would
make
trouble
with
my
bondsmen
and
they
make
trouble
with
me
king
silenced
the
man
with
a
scowl
and
led
him
and
jim
into
the
closing
the
door
it
was
unthinkable
that
gloria
should
hear
a
lot
of
talk
about
why
and
how
for
gloria
it
struck
him
had
undergone
enough
for
one
day
look
here
he
said
to
summerling
then
either
you
will
or
you
wo
if
you
wo
then
miss
gaynor
and
myself
will
go
elsewhere
now
which
is
it
gratton
promised
me
a
hundred
dollars
muttered
the
judge
and
he
cleared
out
without
taking
the
trouble
to
pay
me
king
face
cleared
his
cheque
for
a
hundred
dollars
decided
the
judge
that
a
might
of
money
to
pay
the
old
duffer
for
one
night
work
mark
muttered
jim
strikes
me
that
way
anyhow
a
might
of
money
king
laughed
now
if
you
folks
are
ready
said
summerling
grown
impatient
the
moment
the
cheque
was
in
his
pocket
i
got
a
long
ride
ahead
of
me
this
time
gloria
did
not
keep
them
waiting
she
came
down
the
staircase
to
mark
king
standing
at
the
bottom
in
her
pink
dress
like
a
thistledown
floating
down
to
him
he
was
thinking
she
too
remembered
how
for
the
first
time
they
had
met
thus
she
smiled
at
him
she
put
out
her
two
hands
to
him
as
she
had
done
that
other
time
and
right
there
they
were
married
on
gus
ingle
old
bible
it
done
whispered
mark
bending
over
her
you
are
mine
now
mine
for
all
time
gloria
and
girl
of
mine
he
added
reverently
may
god
deal
with
me
as
i
deal
with
you
it
done
in
an
awed
little
voice
came
gloria
response
like
an
echo
mark
king
had
seen
her
across
the
quicksands
jim
and
the
judge
had
gone
they
two
were
alone
in
the
still
house
gloria
was
nervous
king
could
see
that
and
thought
that
he
understood
so
he
went
for
wood
made
a
cheery
blaze
in
the
fireplace
and
drew
two
chairs
up
to
it
tell
me
about
papa
letter
said
gloria
hastily
had
there
not
been
that
obvious
topic
she
would
have
caught
at
another
any
other
he
did
tell
me
how
badly
he
was
hurt
or
what
had
happened
king
put
out
his
hand
for
hers
and
while
gloria
looked
into
the
fire
and
he
looked
into
her
face
he
told
her
at
the
end
he
brought
out
gus
ingle
bible
and
read
to
her
what
was
written
in
it
all
the
time
that
his
eyes
were
occupied
she
watched
him
eagerly
a
little
anxiously
but
by
the
time
he
had
finished
she
had
been
intrigued
for
the
moment
out
of
her
own
thoughts
her
fancies
caught
by
all
that
underlay
this
crude
tale
of
treasure
and
murder
of
lust
for
gold
of
treachery
and
lonely
death
and
you
know
where
it
is
i
can
go
to
it
as
straight
as
a
string
two
days
to
get
to
it
and
to
stake
a
claim
two
days
to
come
out
with
a
couple
of
horses
loaded
to
the
guards
and
that
itself
means
a
fortune
if
it
clean
raw
gold
as
would
seem
to
be
the
case
we
need
not
fear
the
poorhouse
you
and
i
mrs
king
but
brodie
and
mr
gratton
they
do
know
where
it
is
they
ca
know
since
we
got
the
bible
and
honeycutt
was
dead
before
they
got
to
him
if
they
knew
they
would
have
been
on
their
way
already
and
i
be
striking
out
before
dawn
leaving
no
such
trail
that
they
can
follow
it
in
a
hurry
even
if
they
should
seek
to
no
brodie
and
gratton
and
the
rest
of
them
have
lost
the
game
you
are
going
so
soon
papa
wanted
that
he
wanted
me
to
telephone
as
soon
as
i
got
this
he
rose
lingering
over
her
we
must
forget
him
even
for
our
own
happiness
he
brushed
her
hair
with
his
lips
he
hastened
the
few
steps
to
the
telephone
in
ben
study
i
i
am
going
upstairs
mark
called
gloria
after
him
all
right
queen
of
the
world
he
answered
her
i
just
to
phone
in
a
message
for
him
it
wo
take
me
five
minutes
to
get
it
done
just
to
say
ben
that
i
start
at
dawn
and
that
he
got
my
word
for
it
that
nothing
going
to
stop
me
and
that
i
just
married
gloria
but
he
was
at
the
telephone
longer
than
he
thought
to
be
the
operator
buzzed
into
his
ear
as
he
took
down
the
receiver
san
francisco
was
trying
to
get
a
message
through
for
gloria
gaynor
would
he
take
the
message
then
an
operator
in
san
francisco
droning
the
words
for
miss
gloria
gaynor
your
father
is
hurt
in
coloma
just
sent
me
word
says
not
dangerously
but
i
must
go
to
him
immediately
meet
me
there
mamma
got
it
said
king
and
san
francisco
rang
off
thereafter
he
got
his
own
message
through
he
wondered
how
gaynor
would
take
the
news
of
her
new
ben
would
be
glad
he
was
sure
of
ben
gloria
was
still
upstairs
king
sat
in
front
of
the
fire
staring
into
the
flames
listening
to
the
wind
in
the
chimney
waiting
for
gloria
when
time
passed
and
she
did
not
come
he
went
softly
upstairs
and
to
her
door
it
was
closed
and
he
knocked
lightly
then
dropped
his
hand
to
the
knob
awaiting
her
voice
his
knuckles
had
hardly
brushed
the
door
this
door
which
he
approached
in
reverence
gloria
had
not
even
heard
him
he
called
softly
his
voice
little
above
a
whisper
gloria
he
heard
her
move
for
a
moment
she
did
not
answer
he
could
not
know
how
she
stood
scarcely
breathing
her
hands
at
her
breast
nor
how
now
that
the
great
step
was
taken
she
was
again
altogether
bewildered
and
uncertain
of
herself
of
him
of
everything
is
it
you
mark
yes
may
i
come
in
gloria
please
mark
it
all
so
new
so
strange
i
intended
to
come
right
back
downstairs
but
i
so
tired
mark
and
i
want
to
be
alone
a
little
to
think
i
have
had
time
to
think
of
anything
you
mind
do
you
mark
he
answered
promptly
and
heartily
refusing
to
allow
himself
to
harbour
a
shadow
of
disappointment
no
no
of
course
not
you
will
go
right
to
bed
i
know
you
must
be
for
sleep
yes
there
was
a
note
of
eagerness
in
the
voice
coming
to
him
from
beyond
the
shut
door
there
was
a
message
from
your
mother
she
has
gone
to
your
father
and
wanted
you
to
meet
her
there
but
we
will
talk
of
that
later
yes
mark
are
you
going
to
kiss
me
he
asked
hesitating
a
little
between
the
words
his
new
privilege
a
lover
a
husband
was
not
an
hour
old
he
felt
strangely
shy
as
he
spoke
softly
to
her
please
mark
i
am
terribly
tired
out
and
and
i
afraid
i
mislaid
the
key
and
that
hurt
him
his
eyes
darkened
with
the
quick
pain
that
came
to
him
from
her
words
he
had
hoped
that
gloria
had
known
him
better
than
that
you
need
never
lock
your
door
against
me
my
dear
he
told
her
gently
i
do
want
you
to
be
afraid
of
me
why
god
bless
you
i
touch
the
hem
of
your
dress
if
you
did
want
me
to
yes
said
gloria
i
know
you
are
so
good
mark
but
now
i
am
going
he
returned
tenderly
to
sit
by
the
fire
and
think
just
to
soak
myself
in
the
realization
he
added
with
a
happy
laugh
that
you
are
mine
before
you
go
in
the
morning
you
will
come
to
my
door
if
you
want
me
to
of
course
mark
then
dear
mark
king
was
astir
long
before
dawn
he
got
the
fire
going
in
the
kitchen
and
started
breakfast
seeking
to
be
very
silent
and
succeeding
in
making
the
usual
clatter
of
a
male
among
pots
and
pans
whilst
water
heated
and
bacon
sizzled
he
rummaged
through
the
at
the
rear
of
the
house
gathering
what
he
meant
to
put
into
his
pack
for
the
four
or
five
days
trip
as
he
returned
from
the
last
journey
to
the
his
arms
full
of
camp
accessories
including
canvas
and
camp
blankets
he
confronted
gloria
fully
dressed
he
dropped
his
and
filled
his
eyes
with
her
any
shadow
left
overnight
in
his
heart
was
sent
scurrying
before
his
new
joyousness
gloria
had
come
down
to
him
while
he
deemed
her
fast
asleep
gloria
he
cried
a
more
radiantly
lovely
gloria
he
had
never
looked
upon
she
had
slept
and
rested
she
had
bathed
and
groomed
and
set
herself
in
order
she
was
dressed
after
a
fashion
to
bewilder
a
mere
man
in
the
only
utterly
ravishing
outing
costume
mark
king
had
ever
seen
he
felt
insanely
inclined
to
pick
up
her
little
boots
one
after
the
other
and
go
down
on
his
knees
and
kiss
them
her
hat
was
a
flopsy
turban
from
under
the
brim
of
which
the
most
adorable
of
curls
half
escaped
to
throw
on
her
rosy
cheeks
and
gloria
eyes
this
time
there
was
no
door
between
them
nor
even
the
memory
of
a
door
he
gathered
her
up
into
his
arms
so
that
her
swung
clear
of
the
floor
do
you
know
do
you
guess
have
you
the
faintest
suspicion
how
i
love
you
the
the
coffee
gasped
gloria
it
boiling
over
he
laughed
joyously
at
that
and
finally
when
he
had
set
her
down
gloria
bright
and
flushed
laughed
too
burning
bacon
last
night
boiling
coffee
this
morning
he
chuckled
and
then
there
in
the
kitchen
they
sat
down
to
breakfast
it
sweet
of
you
he
told
her
softly
to
get
up
and
come
down
and
see
me
off
oh
said
gloria
i
am
going
with
you
not
once
had
king
dared
think
of
a
thing
like
that
he
had
thought
that
at
best
he
would
be
with
her
again
in
four
or
five
days
but
that
she
should
go
with
him
into
the
mountains
on
this
quest
of
his
he
sat
and
pondered
and
stared
at
her
do
you
want
me
asked
gloria
are
you
glad
mark
she
was
serenely
prepared
for
objections
should
they
be
forthcoming
for
it
was
not
on
any
spur
of
the
moment
but
after
long
deliberation
that
she
had
decided
that
she
would
go
with
him
she
wanted
no
scandal
in
the
papers
she
meant
that
there
should
be
none
if
it
were
rumoured
that
she
had
gone
out
of
town
with
gratton
if
gratton
wanted
to
be
ugly
and
feed
rumour
then
on
top
of
that
if
she
appeared
within
reach
of
a
reporter
without
a
husband
there
would
be
talk
if
it
were
answered
that
she
was
married
to
mark
king
there
would
be
the
question
and
where
my
dear
is
this
mark
king
those
girl
friends
in
san
francisco
who
had
met
him
at
her
would
be
fairly
squirming
with
excited
curiosity
to
know
among
themselves
they
would
make
insinuations
about
the
bear
tamer
or
the
animal
trainer
as
gloria
knew
that
they
would
variously
and
mirthfully
designate
him
they
would
find
it
unusual
that
king
had
married
her
one
day
and
had
gone
off
the
next
without
her
they
would
hazard
endless
unpleasant
explanations
they
would
get
their
heads
together
they
would
make
an
astonishing
patchwork
of
scraps
of
distorted
rumour
and
bits
of
wild
speculation
from
upstairs
last
night
she
had
heard
fragmentary
outbursts
from
the
judge
irregular
no
licence
now
gloria
meant
to
kill
the
snake
outright
not
to
allow
the
scotched
reptile
to
writhe
free
she
was
married
she
was
going
with
her
husband
into
the
wilderness
on
the
most
romantic
of
all
honeymoons
the
papers
were
free
to
make
much
of
that
of
course
i
want
you
said
king
slowly
glad
glad
that
you
want
to
come
with
me
ca
you
see
that
i
am
the
gladdest
man
on
earth
but
i
have
already
written
a
message
i
wanted
to
send
to
a
girl
friend
in
san
francisco
it
was
to
miss
mildred
carter
who
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
bob
dwight
of
the
i
was
going
to
have
it
phoned
in
to
her
it
tells
her
i
married
to
you
mark
and
that
we
off
on
the
most
wonderful
trip
together
into
the
heart
of
the
wild
country
god
bless
you
he
said
heartily
but
gloria
glancing
at
him
swiftly
saw
that
his
eyes
were
clouded
with
perplexity
of
course
she
said
if
you
do
want
a
girl
along
gloria
well
then
it
settled
i
to
go
only
i
afraid
it
is
the
sort
of
a
trip
for
a
girl
it
hard
going
and
oh
it
a
cursed
shame
i
ca
put
it
off
you
said
last
night
that
you
were
afraid
of
anything
brodie
and
his
men
could
do
that
they
did
even
know
where
to
go
that
they
never
know
where
to
find
you
yes
and
i
meant
it
but
he
wanted
her
with
him
she
wanted
to
come
further
it
pained
him
to
think
that
those
first
glorious
days
should
be
spent
with
the
mountains
between
them
he
was
tempted
sorely
tempted
gloria
knew
she
smiled
at
him
across
the
table
she
tempted
him
further
was
there
really
any
danger
would
there
be
danger
to
her
if
he
thought
so
that
there
was
the
faintest
likelihood
of
harm
to
her
he
would
say
no
no
matter
what
the
yearning
in
his
heart
but
if
they
made
a
quick
dash
in
and
out
two
days
each
way
not
over
one
day
at
gus
ingle
caves
if
they
went
on
horseback
nearly
all
the
way
and
travelled
light
he
carried
a
rifle
nowadays
and
he
rather
believed
he
might
carry
it
ten
years
without
ever
firing
a
shot
at
any
man
of
their
hulking
crowd
they
could
go
in
one
way
come
out
another
they
had
at
least
a
full
day
head
start
of
any
possible
followers
no
in
his
heart
he
did
not
believe
that
there
would
be
any
danger
to
gloria
further
the
thought
struck
him
that
she
would
not
be
altogether
safe
here
there
was
venom
in
gratton
god
only
knew
how
virulent
and
there
was
sinister
significance
in
the
fact
that
gratton
was
hand
in
glove
now
with
swen
brodie
then
too
gratton
knew
from
gloria
own
lips
that
she
had
brought
the
message
from
her
father
in
coloma
hence
gratton
might
suspect
and
brodie
after
him
that
gloria
was
in
possession
of
old
loony
secret
instead
of
seeming
hazardous
to
take
gloria
with
him
it
began
to
appear
that
his
new
responsibility
of
guarding
her
from
all
harm
had
begun
already
and
that
he
could
best
protect
her
from
any
possible
evil
by
having
her
always
with
him
he
could
not
allow
her
to
go
to
her
parents
in
coloma
he
thought
of
that
but
that
was
brodie
hangout
and
ben
was
in
no
condition
to
send
for
her
nor
was
it
advisable
for
her
to
go
alone
to
san
francisco
her
mother
was
not
there
and
gratton
might
be
looked
on
to
follow
her
with
himself
communed
mark
king
never
a
man
overly
given
to
caution
but
seeking
now
to
measure
chances
to
set
them
in
the
scales
over
against
the
desire
of
his
heart
a
fanciful
thought
insisted
on
being
heard
had
gus
ingle
treasure
hidden
itself
all
these
years
awaiting
the
time
when
he
and
gloria
together
came
to
it
their
wedding
gift
how
much
more
precious
then
than
mere
gold
we
travel
light
he
said
thoughtfully
and
gloria
knew
that
she
had
won
we
go
in
quick
out
quick
it
getting
late
in
the
year
he
added
with
a
smile
and
we
have
to
hurry
brodie
or
no
brodie
no
notion
for
a
prolonged
honeymoon
in
those
mountains
her
eyes
danced
would
that
be
fun
his
smile
quickened
her
childish
ignorance
of
what
such
an
adventure
would
mean
was
in
keeping
with
her
vast
inexperience
with
matters
of
the
outdoors
she
had
merely
begun
in
his
company
to
glimpse
the
true
meanings
of
the
solitudes
she
would
learn
further
with
him
and
a
warm
glow
of
pleasure
came
with
the
thought
that
gloria
wanted
to
go
the
dawn
was
flowering
into
a
still
pink
morning
when
they
locked
the
door
behind
them
and
stepped
out
into
the
crisp
sweet
freshness
of
the
autumn
air
he
had
made
two
small
packs
provisions
rolled
into
the
bedding
and
the
whole
wrapped
in
pieces
of
canvas
he
estimated
they
would
be
gone
five
days
and
then
making
due
allowance
for
any
reasonable
delay
provisioned
for
ten
when
he
saw
that
gloria
had
noted
how
for
the
first
time
on
a
woodland
jaunt
with
her
he
carried
a
very
rifle
he
explained
laughingly
that
if
they
developed
abnormal
appetites
there
were
both
deer
and
bear
to
be
had
she
was
much
interested
in
everything
and
looked
out
to
the
mountains
eagerly
when
king
had
swung
her
up
to
her
saddle
on
blackie
the
tall
horse
where
she
sat
with
a
roll
of
blankets
at
her
back
and
with
the
horn
before
her
decorated
with
a
miscellany
of
camp
equipment
a
a
axe
in
its
sheath
an
overcoat
done
into
a
compact
bundle
here
was
another
moment
when
thoughts
were
too
slow
processes
to
emphasize
themselves
she
was
swayed
by
emotions
provoked
by
the
moment
where
were
the
trunks
and
suitcases
and
to
accompany
the
young
bride
in
their
stead
a
coat
tied
into
a
tight
bundle
and
a
before
her
king
looked
at
her
and
marvelled
her
cheeks
were
roses
her
eyes
were
gloria
own
wonderful
and
big
and
deep
beyond
fathoming
from
his
own
saddle
on
the
buckskin
he
nodded
his
approval
of
her
you
are
not
afraid
that
i
ca
take
care
of
you
are
you
gloria
he
asked
and
gloria
laughed
gaily
answering
my
dear
man
i
am
not
the
least
little
bit
afraid
of
anything
in
all
the
world
this
morning
so
with
the
glorious
day
brightening
all
about
them
they
turned
away
from
the
log
house
and
into
the
trail
which
straightway
king
dubbed
adventure
trail
and
as
they
went
he
sang
out
joyously
the
lord
knows
what
we
find
dear
heart
and
the
deuce
knows
what
we
do
but
we
back
once
more
on
the
old
trail
our
own
trail
the
out
trail
and
life
runs
large
on
the
long
trail
the
trail
that
is
always
new
the
magnificent
wilderness
into
which
rode
mark
and
gloria
king
seemed
to
prostrate
its
august
self
to
do
them
honour
upon
this
their
wedding
morning
succeeding
the
paler
tints
of
the
earlier
hour
came
the
rare
blue
day
last
night
clouds
had
vanished
the
air
was
clear
and
crisp
with
still
a
hint
of
frost
on
all
hands
had
october
in
passing
splashed
the
world
with
colour
along
the
creek
the
aspens
danced
and
played
and
shivered
in
bright
golden
raiment
through
the
bushes
there
was
a
glimpse
of
vivid
scarlet
where
the
leaves
of
a
dwarf
maple
were
as
bright
as
a
little
grove
of
gracefully
slender
poplars
trembled
in
yellow
against
the
azure
above
the
clear
thin
sunlight
pricked
out
colours
until
it
made
the
woods
a
riot
of
them
greens
dark
and
light
the
grey
of
sage
the
white
of
a
granite
seam
the
black
of
a
lava
rock
and
in
the
creek
spray
a
brilliant
rainbow
sheen
they
two
riding
side
by
side
while
the
broad
trail
permitted
passed
over
the
ridge
and
out
of
sight
of
the
house
immediately
the
solitudes
shut
down
about
them
with
titanic
walls
they
rode
down
into
a
long
shadowy
hollow
out
through
a
tiny
verdant
meadow
fringed
with
the
rusty
brown
of
sunflower
leaves
and
on
up
to
the
crest
of
the
second
ridge
already
they
were
alone
in
the
world
a
man
and
his
mate
with
only
infinity
and
its
concrete
symbols
embracing
them
ancient
and
ageless
trees
limitless
sky
mile
after
mile
of
ridge
and
precipice
and
barren
peak
and
upon
them
and
about
them
and
within
them
the
utter
serene
hush
of
the
sierra
with
every
swinging
step
of
the
horses
taking
them
on
a
new
gladness
blossomed
in
king
heart
for
they
were
pushing
ever
further
into
the
portion
of
the
world
which
he
knew
best
loved
best
the
present
left
him
nothing
to
wish
for
he
had
gloria
and
gloria
had
elected
to
come
with
him
until
high
noon
they
would
wind
along
for
the
most
part
climbing
pretty
steadily
with
the
old
trail
indian
trail
trail
trail
which
even
seems
to
lead
from
the
first
generation
of
the
twentieth
century
straight
back
into
the
heart
of
and
beyond
here
men
did
not
penetrate
save
at
long
intervals
here
was
true
solitude
and
soon
when
they
should
leave
this
trail
to
travel
as
straight
a
line
as
the
broken
country
would
allow
toward
gus
caves
they
would
enter
a
region
given
over
entirely
to
the
wild
own
shy
inhabitants
there
were
red
spots
in
gloria
cheeks
when
they
started
king
sought
to
guess
at
what
might
be
the
emotions
of
a
young
girl
going
on
with
gloria
present
emotional
adventure
vain
task
of
a
mere
man
seeking
to
fathom
those
troubled
feminine
depths
marking
that
she
was
a
little
nervous
and
distrait
i
know
the
place
gus
ingle
tried
to
describe
he
said
as
well
as
i
know
my
old
hat
or
at
least
i
have
said
so
until
he
mentioned
the
third
cave
i
been
there
dozens
of
times
too
but
i
got
to
see
more
than
two
caves
there
yet
together
they
had
read
the
crabbed
lines
in
the
bible
they
had
been
silent
thereafter
as
to
each
came
imagined
pictures
like
ghosts
from
the
past
ghosts
of
greed
and
envy
and
despair
now
gloria
mused
aloud
i
wonder
do
you
suppose
we
find
it
as
he
says
at
least
we
see
about
it
and
whether
there
be
heaps
and
piles
of
red
red
gold
as
the
tale
telleth
be
sure
our
trip
is
going
to
be
worth
the
two
days
ride
i
show
you
such
chasms
and
gorges
and
crags
as
you
never
turned
those
two
lovely
eyes
of
yours
upon
gloria
king
he
could
abstain
absolutely
from
all
and
a
little
grove
of
sequoias
which
belongs
to
me
or
at
least
i
believe
i
am
the
only
man
who
knows
where
they
are
friends
of
mine
those
big
fellows
are
five
old
monarchs
she
looked
interested
and
treated
him
to
a
fleeting
smile
but
asked
curiously
how
can
a
man
speak
of
a
tree
that
way
as
though
it
were
alive
she
broke
off
laughing
and
amended
but
they
alive
are
they
i
mean
human
why
you
poor
little
angel
he
cried
heartily
you
will
answer
your
own
question
inside
of
two
days
no
doubt
i
going
to
grow
jealous
of
old
vulcan
and
thor
and
majesty
sure
i
named
them
he
chuckled
and
you
come
with
me
into
their
dim
cathedral
at
dusk
and
listen
with
me
to
their
old
sermon
a
man
ought
to
go
to
church
to
them
at
least
once
a
year
to
keep
his
soul
cleaned
out
and
growing
properly
gloria
appeared
thoughtful
that
she
was
interested
just
now
less
in
that
of
which
he
spoke
than
in
the
man
himself
he
did
not
suspect
she
was
noting
how
he
spoke
of
trees
as
friends
how
he
was
different
from
other
men
whom
she
knew
in
that
he
stood
so
much
closer
to
the
ancient
mother
the
wilderness
now
embracing
them
instinctively
she
knew
that
it
behoved
her
to
penetrate
as
deeply
as
she
might
into
the
inner
nature
of
this
man
who
hardly
more
than
a
pleasant
attractive
stranger
yesterday
was
her
husband
what
is
the
oldest
thing
in
the
world
he
asked
her
abruptly
she
wrinkled
her
brows
prettily
at
him
church
evening
and
school
now
she
countered
lightly
answer
insisted
king
just
at
a
rough
guess
what
would
you
say
was
the
oldest
thing
in
the
world
gloria
cudgelled
her
brains
finally
since
he
seemed
quite
serious
and
she
knew
that
wisdom
lay
in
pleasing
the
male
of
the
species
in
small
and
unimportant
matters
she
sought
to
reply
the
sphinx
or
the
pyramids
i
guess
she
offered
naturally
he
returned
and
what
will
you
say
when
i
introduce
you
to
the
pharaoh
who
was
a
big
husky
giant
before
thebes
was
thought
of
again
she
looked
to
see
a
twinkle
of
jest
in
his
eyes
pharaoh
she
said
just
a
tree
over
two
or
three
thousand
years
old
by
at
least
another
thousand
he
rejoined
triumphantly
and
as
staunch
an
old
gentleman
as
you
find
even
gloria
a
poor
little
angel
must
muse
upon
the
statement
having
caught
her
interest
he
told
her
picturesquely
of
his
old
friends
how
they
had
dwelt
on
serenely
while
peoples
were
born
and
empires
rose
and
fell
while
rome
smote
greece
and
both
went
down
in
the
dust
while
columbus
pushed
his
three
boats
across
the
seas
while
the
world
itself
passed
from
one
phase
to
another
how
they
were
all
but
with
eternity
when
you
think
how
these
old
fellows
were
a
thousand
years
old
when
the
christ
was
a
little
boy
he
ended
simply
you
will
begin
to
realize
the
sort
of
things
they
have
a
way
of
saying
to
you
while
you
lie
still
and
look
up
and
up
and
still
up
among
their
branches
that
seem
at
night
to
brush
against
the
stars
she
let
her
fancies
drift
in
the
leash
of
his
but
again
they
left
the
picturesque
ancient
trees
and
returned
to
him
a
little
smile
touched
her
lips
and
was
gone
before
he
was
sure
of
it
she
was
thinking
that
a
man
like
king
kept
always
in
his
heart
something
of
the
simplicity
of
a
little
child
she
wondered
if
she
herself
though
so
much
younger
in
actual
years
were
not
worlds
more
sophisticated
for
his
part
king
noted
that
she
displayed
none
of
that
chattering
singing
gaiety
of
their
former
rides
together
he
remembered
sympathetically
that
she
had
had
very
little
sleep
last
night
and
that
she
had
endured
a
wearisome
hours
before
and
that
the
long
nervous
strain
under
which
she
had
struggled
must
certainly
have
told
upon
her
both
physically
and
mentally
so
believing
that
she
would
be
grateful
for
silence
he
grew
silent
with
her
further
and
ever
further
into
the
heart
of
the
solitudes
they
rode
through
the
quiet
hours
of
the
forenoon
with
gloria
ever
more
abstracted
and
mark
king
holding
apart
from
her
doing
her
reverence
drinking
always
deep
of
that
soft
sweet
beauty
which
was
hers
they
forsook
the
creeks
where
the
aspens
fluttered
their
myriad
little
gleaming
banners
they
made
slow
zigzag
work
of
climbing
a
mountain
they
looked
back
upon
green
meadow
and
gay
poplar
grove
far
below
they
galloped
their
horses
across
a
wide
over
which
shrilled
the
wind
already
sharpened
by
the
season
for
the
work
it
had
to
do
before
many
weeks
passed
though
there
were
some
few
level
spaces
though
now
and
then
as
king
sought
for
her
the
easier
way
they
rode
down
short
slopes
with
every
mile
put
behind
them
they
had
climbed
perceptibly
already
gloria
had
the
sensation
of
being
by
the
world
forgotten
though
for
her
the
world
could
not
be
forgot
a
ridge
from
which
they
looked
out
across
the
peaks
and
valleys
seemed
to
her
like
an
island
lost
remote
eternally
set
apart
from
other
people
whom
she
knew
from
all
her
life
as
she
had
lived
it
she
went
on
and
on
and
felt
like
one
in
a
dream
journeying
into
a
fierce
rugged
land
over
which
lay
a
spell
of
enchantment
a
spell
that
had
been
cast
over
it
before
king
all
but
immortal
trees
had
burst
from
the
seeds
so
that
now
while
the
outside
world
pulsed
and
beat
with
life
and
swung
back
and
forth
with
its
pendulous
progress
here
all
was
unchanged
changeless
king
led
her
well
before
midday
to
the
spot
in
which
from
the
first
he
had
planned
that
they
would
noon
a
forest
pool
ringed
with
boulders
which
were
green
with
moss
under
the
splashing
of
the
water
from
above
where
the
swaying
pines
mirrored
themselves
and
shivered
in
the
little
breeze
which
ruffled
the
clear
cold
water
here
was
a
tiny
upland
meadow
and
much
rich
grass
here
a
sheltered
spot
where
gloria
might
sit
in
the
sun
and
be
protected
from
the
colder
air
he
was
quick
to
help
her
to
dismount
and
noted
that
she
came
down
stiffly
the
eyes
which
she
turned
to
him
were
heavy
with
fatigue
some
of
the
rose
flush
had
faded
from
her
cheeks
maybe
i
should
have
let
you
come
after
all
dear
he
said
contritely
these
are
harder
trails
than
we
ridden
before
and
had
to
keep
at
it
steadier
there
was
an
effort
in
her
smile
answering
him
the
last
two
days
been
hard
to
get
through
with
she
said
as
she
yielded
to
his
insistence
and
sat
down
on
the
i
am
sorry
i
am
so
so
he
did
not
allow
her
to
run
down
the
elusive
word
nonsense
he
told
her
heartily
you
got
a
right
to
be
tired
but
when
you
had
some
hot
lunch
and
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
you
be
again
you
see
king
unsaddled
and
tethered
the
horses
where
they
could
browse
and
rest
and
roll
built
his
little
fire
and
went
about
with
a
joy
he
had
never
known
in
the
old
accustomed
routine
before
now
and
then
he
glanced
toward
gloria
he
could
not
help
that
but
he
saw
that
she
was
lying
back
her
eyes
closed
and
while
his
heart
went
out
to
her
he
did
not
force
his
sympathy
on
her
she
was
tired
and
what
was
more
she
had
every
right
and
reason
to
be
tired
he
hoped
that
she
might
get
three
winks
of
sleep
when
he
came
near
her
for
the
he
tiptoed
she
seemed
to
be
asleep
but
gloria
was
not
asleep
never
had
her
mind
raced
so
it
was
done
and
she
was
mark
king
wife
higher
and
higher
loomed
that
fact
above
all
other
considerations
but
there
were
other
considerations
her
father
hurt
she
did
not
know
how
badly
her
mother
mystified
by
now
perhaps
informed
of
gloria
marriage
gratton
with
the
poison
extracted
from
his
fangs
had
the
fangs
still
gold
ahead
somewhere
in
caves
where
men
long
ago
had
laboured
and
fought
and
snarled
at
one
another
like
starving
wolves
and
died
brodie
somewhere
brodie
with
the
horrible
face
she
shivered
and
stirred
restlessly
and
king
who
saw
everything
thought
that
she
had
dreamed
a
bad
dream
but
lunch
was
ready
he
came
to
her
with
plate
and
cup
and
again
gloria
did
her
best
to
smile
gratefully
you
are
so
good
to
me
mark
she
said
her
eyes
were
thoughtful
would
he
always
be
good
to
her
even
when
but
she
was
too
weary
to
think
it
seemed
to
her
that
only
now
was
she
beginning
to
feel
the
effects
of
all
she
had
been
through
i
want
to
learn
how
to
be
good
to
you
wife
of
mine
he
said
very
gently
that
is
all
on
earth
i
ask
just
to
make
you
happy
you
love
me
so
much
mark
she
asked
as
one
who
wondered
at
what
she
had
read
in
his
low
voice
and
glimpsed
in
his
eyes
gloria
he
told
her
gently
i
do
understand
this
thing
they
call
love
yet
it
is
too
new
too
wonderful
but
i
do
know
that
in
all
the
world
there
is
nothing
else
that
matters
not
even
gus
ingle
red
red
gold
she
said
rather
more
lightly
than
she
had
spoken
not
even
gus
ingle
red
red
gold
she
looked
at
him
long
and
curiously
you
would
do
anything
you
could
to
make
me
happy
anything
mark
i
pray
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
that
i
always
may
gloria
seemed
to
rest
through
the
noon
hour
and
to
brighten
when
she
saw
him
the
second
time
look
at
the
sun
she
got
up
from
the
ground
and
said
time
to
go
on
i
ready
and
after
that
banquet
i
feel
all
again
he
laughed
and
went
off
after
the
horses
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
she
stood
very
still
looking
off
after
him
her
brows
puckering
into
a
shadowy
frown
oh
if
she
could
only
read
herself
as
he
allowed
her
to
read
him
if
she
could
only
be
as
sure
of
gloria
as
she
was
of
mark
if
she
could
only
look
deep
into
her
heart
as
she
looked
into
his
but
she
could
not
his
heart
was
like
the
clear
pool
just
yonder
across
which
the
sunshine
lay
and
far
down
in
which
she
could
see
the
stones
and
pebbles
as
through
so
much
clear
glass
hers
was
like
the
rushing
stream
above
eddying
and
swirling
and
hiding
itself
under
its
own
light
spray
all
day
long
she
had
tried
to
see
what
lay
under
the
surface
she
love
mark
she
had
thrilled
to
him
as
she
had
thrilled
to
no
other
man
but
that
had
been
in
the
springtime
twice
then
she
had
been
sure
that
she
loved
him
but
that
was
so
long
ago
and
now
that
she
had
allowed
him
to
carry
her
out
of
the
quicksands
what
now
she
was
so
borne
down
by
all
that
she
had
lived
through
he
was
so
much
a
part
of
the
mountainous
solitudes
towering
about
them
and
was
she
one
to
love
the
wilderness
for
long
or
did
it
not
begin
to
bear
down
upon
her
uncertain
spirit
did
it
not
menace
and
frighten
and
in
the
end
would
it
not
repel
oh
if
she
had
only
let
him
go
on
alone
this
morning
if
she
had
remained
where
she
could
rest
and
think
and
thus
come
to
see
clearly
even
into
her
own
troubled
heart
their
first
hour
after
lunch
led
them
through
a
region
which
given
over
to
silence
itself
denied
them
any
considerable
opportunity
for
conversation
king
rode
ahead
turning
off
to
the
left
from
their
by
the
pool
and
riding
through
a
sea
of
grey
brush
following
a
narrow
trail
made
by
deer
then
the
reared
its
barrier
and
made
all
forward
and
upward
progress
slow
and
toilsome
three
times
they
dismounted
and
king
led
the
horses
here
gloria
clung
to
the
steep
looking
fearfully
down
into
the
monster
gorge
carved
at
its
base
dwelling
with
fascinated
fancies
on
the
thought
of
slipping
losing
handhold
and
foothold
and
plunging
down
among
the
jagged
boulders
strewing
the
lower
levels
there
was
really
no
great
danger
she
told
herself
over
and
over
king
cheery
calls
reassured
her
no
danger
so
long
as
they
went
forward
on
foot
but
now
and
then
when
a
horse
foot
slipped
and
a
wild
cascade
of
loose
soil
and
rocks
went
hurtling
downward
she
grew
rigid
with
apprehension
but
there
was
only
an
hour
of
this
thereafter
they
rode
down
a
long
slope
and
into
a
long
narrow
twisting
ravine
rocky
cliffs
on
one
hand
and
a
noisy
stream
on
the
other
a
fair
trail
underfoot
nearly
always
now
king
rode
ahead
finding
the
way
for
her
and
gloria
her
spirits
drooping
again
with
the
advancing
afternoon
vaguely
oppressed
by
the
solemn
stillness
about
her
was
glad
that
she
too
could
be
silent
when
he
did
call
to
her
she
needed
only
nod
or
smile
he
turned
to
point
out
some
rare
view
that
appealed
to
him
a
vista
worth
her
seeing
a
cascade
or
a
fall
of
cliff
or
a
ferny
nook
or
perhaps
a
late
blossom
he
pointed
out
a
scampering
douglas
squirrel
and
had
her
hearken
to
a
quail
we
already
in
the
finest
timber
belt
in
the
world
he
told
her
full
of
enthusiastic
loyalty
to
his
beloved
mountains
thus
he
leading
the
way
she
following
with
head
down
and
shoulders
drooping
they
came
about
four
to
a
small
meadow
studded
with
big
yellow
pines
and
here
and
there
graced
with
an
incense
cedar
stopping
in
the
open
sitting
sideways
in
the
saddle
he
waited
for
her
and
what
do
you
think
of
this
miss
gloria
he
called
gaily
as
her
horse
thrust
his
black
nose
through
the
alders
down
by
the
creek
gloria
drew
rein
and
looked
at
him
with
large
eyes
across
the
twenty
paces
separating
them
i
ca
go
any
further
she
said
bleakly
i
tired
out
he
was
quick
to
see
a
gathering
of
tears
and
swung
down
from
his
horse
and
went
to
her
with
long
strides
his
own
eyes
filled
with
concern
poor
little
kidlet
he
said
humbly
i
let
you
do
yourself
up
and
it
was
his
duty
his
privilege
and
no
one
else
in
the
world
to
shelter
her
to
stand
between
her
and
all
hardship
he
put
out
his
arms
to
take
her
into
them
quite
as
he
could
have
picked
up
a
little
maid
of
six
something
stirring
in
the
depths
of
him
which
in
man
is
twin
to
the
maternal
instinct
in
woman
but
gloria
said
hurriedly
please
mark
i
am
so
tired
and
drew
back
and
he
let
his
hands
fall
to
his
side
for
a
second
time
her
act
hurt
him
her
gesture
was
akin
to
locking
a
door
last
night
but
in
a
moment
his
pity
and
loyalty
and
staunch
faith
in
her
crowding
the
small
ache
out
of
his
heart
he
was
unrolling
a
pack
making
a
temporary
couch
for
her
and
commanding
her
lovingly
just
to
lie
down
and
look
up
at
the
above
her
and
rest
while
he
staked
out
the
horses
sensing
that
perhaps
the
very
bigness
and
majestic
silence
of
these
uplands
might
rest
heavy
upon
her
spirit
and
perhaps
depress
if
not
actually
awake
in
her
an
emotion
akin
to
fear
he
strove
to
cheer
her
by
his
own
blithe
acceptance
of
the
fortune
of
the
hour
he
told
her
heartily
that
she
had
earned
a
rest
if
any
one
ever
had
that
it
was
well
after
all
to
get
an
early
start
at
pitching
camp
that
he
was
going
to
make
his
as
cosy
here
in
his
big
outdoor
home
as
was
ever
princess
in
castle
walls
gloria
shivered
and
threw
herself
face
down
on
the
blankets
gloria
did
not
know
what
possessed
her
she
fought
for
repression
hiding
her
face
from
him
out
of
a
hideously
stern
world
a
black
spirit
had
leaped
upon
her
it
clutched
at
her
throat
it
dragged
at
her
heart
when
king
called
a
cheery
word
from
beyond
the
thicket
where
he
had
gone
with
the
horses
she
could
have
screamed
she
was
so
nervous
that
now
and
again
a
fierce
tremor
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
king
was
counting
it
fortunate
that
they
were
granted
so
likely
a
camp
site
for
the
night
he
looked
up
at
the
tall
black
cliffs
shutting
in
the
little
meadow
they
would
hold
back
the
night
winds
from
gloria
he
chose
the
spot
well
back
from
the
creek
where
she
would
sleep
high
overhead
like
brooding
giants
stood
the
upright
pines
where
a
little
clump
of
mere
youngsters
lusty
fellows
not
a
score
of
years
old
had
the
air
of
pressing
close
together
as
though
thus
with
their
combined
strength
they
sought
to
match
the
strength
of
their
aloof
parents
a
compact
grove
to
make
a
further
shelter
against
the
mountain
air
gloria
would
sleep
he
stretched
a
strip
of
canvas
from
tree
to
tree
making
a
wall
of
it
close
by
he
started
his
fire
knowing
from
experience
oft
repeated
how
a
cheery
blaze
in
the
forest
may
dispel
shadows
within
even
as
it
makes
the
sombrest
of
shadows
dance
gaily
under
the
trees
to
one
side
he
laid
many
resinous
faggots
planning
on
their
crackling
light
later
on
when
the
dark
came
he
ringed
his
fire
with
rocks
lugging
them
as
heavy
as
he
could
carry
up
from
the
creek
side
making
the
rudest
of
fireplaces
but
it
had
the
merit
that
it
threw
the
heat
back
toward
his
extended
canvas
and
there
between
it
would
be
snug
and
warm
all
about
him
as
he
laboured
was
the
singing
of
water
and
high
in
air
the
singing
of
pine
tops
they
made
merry
music
and
king
gone
down
to
the
stream
to
fill
his
sang
with
it
from
a
full
brimming
heart
gloria
was
tired
but
she
was
resting
now
and
in
a
little
while
when
dark
came
he
and
she
would
sit
by
his
fire
and
look
into
it
and
talk
in
hushed
voices
hand
locked
in
hand
they
would
watch
for
the
first
of
the
big
blazing
stars
to
come
out
he
and
gloria
alone
in
the
wilderness
he
saw
a
trout
swinging
lazily
in
a
quiet
pool
trout
for
gloria
he
glanced
toward
where
she
lay
he
was
glad
that
she
was
not
looking
it
would
be
a
surprise
for
her
he
hurried
to
his
kit
in
his
pack
got
out
hook
and
line
baited
with
a
tiny
bit
of
red
flannel
and
went
back
to
the
creek
for
he
knew
that
it
was
not
likely
that
the
trout
here
could
have
had
any
remembered
encounters
with
man
they
were
plentiful
and
might
like
many
other
sorts
of
beings
be
lured
to
their
undoing
by
curiosity
and
greed
he
cut
a
willow
pole
stood
back
and
cast
out
his
gay
bit
of
bait
letting
it
drift
with
the
riffles
there
came
a
quick
tug
another
sharp
and
vigorous
and
he
swung
his
prize
out
of
the
water
breaking
the
surface
into
scattering
jewels
flashing
in
the
sunlight
as
it
struck
against
the
grass
along
the
creek
edge
dusk
gathered
while
he
worked
over
his
fire
the
aroma
of
boiling
coffee
rose
crept
through
the
air
blended
with
the
aromas
of
the
woods
he
had
made
toast
holding
the
bread
to
the
coals
upon
a
sharpened
stick
there
were
strips
of
crisp
bacon
garnishing
a
trout
browned
to
the
last
painstaking
turn
there
were
fried
potatoes
cut
by
king
into
thin
strips
and
turned
into
gold
by
the
alchemy
of
cooking
he
set
out
his
dishes
upon
a
rock
replenished
his
fire
threw
on
some
green
cedar
boughs
for
their
delightful
fragrance
and
went
to
call
gloria
gloria
too
tired
bodily
and
mentally
to
wage
a
winning
battle
against
those
black
vapours
which
flock
so
frequently
about
luckless
youth
had
suffered
and
yielded
and
gone
down
in
misery
she
had
been
crying
just
why
she
knew
not
crying
because
she
could
not
help
it
hers
was
a
state
of
overwrought
nerves
which
forbade
clear
thinking
which
distorted
and
warped
and
magnified
the
babble
of
the
water
which
had
been
music
to
king
was
to
her
a
chorus
of
jeering
voices
the
wind
in
the
pines
an
eerie
moaning
as
of
lost
spirits
wailing
the
trees
themselves
merging
with
the
dusk
were
brooding
shadowy
giant
things
which
she
suddenly
both
feared
and
hated
the
cliffs
rising
against
the
sky
loomed
so
near
and
so
gigantically
tall
that
she
felt
as
though
they
were
pressing
in
upon
her
to
suffocate
her
to
crush
her
to
annihilate
her
the
world
was
turning
black
with
the
night
the
night
rushed
treading
out
the
last
gleam
of
sunlight
even
the
one
star
which
she
had
glimpsed
through
her
tears
impressed
her
only
with
its
remoteness
she
was
frightened
not
because
of
any
physical
violence
for
mark
king
stood
between
her
and
that
but
of
vague
horrors
she
thought
of
san
francisco
of
her
own
bright
room
there
of
the
lights
in
the
streets
of
pedestrians
and
motors
and
filling
that
other
wilderness
with
familiar
noises
and
somehow
san
francisco
seemed
further
away
immeasurably
further
away
than
that
one
remote
star
blazing
through
the
vastness
of
space
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
bit
of
supper
king
said
gently
you
feel
a
lot
better
she
rose
wearily
and
followed
him
without
a
word
she
dropped
down
beside
his
banquet
putting
out
a
listless
hand
to
her
tin
cup
the
firelight
upon
her
face
showed
him
her
thoughtful
eyes
but
they
were
turned
not
toward
him
but
toward
the
bed
of
coals
he
had
anticipated
her
lively
surprise
at
the
trout
she
pushed
the
brown
morsel
aside
saying
absently
i
am
not
hungry
it
was
good
of
you
to
go
to
all
of
this
trouble
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
much
of
a
camper
she
forced
the
shadow
of
a
smile
with
the
admission
tuckered
out
he
thought
as
he
looked
into
her
face
across
which
light
and
shadow
flickered
as
flame
and
smoke
in
the
came
and
went
fitfully
twisted
by
the
evening
breeze
clean
tuckered
out
gloria
feeling
his
gaze
so
steady
upon
her
turned
her
eyes
toward
his
eyes
heavy
and
sober
with
her
drooping
spirit
as
the
flames
frolicked
about
the
he
had
tossed
to
the
coals
he
saw
the
traces
of
tears
he
said
nothing
supposing
that
he
understood
he
but
strove
the
harder
to
be
good
to
her
to
share
with
her
some
of
that
rare
joy
filling
his
own
heart
he
sought
with
unobtrusive
tenderness
to
anticipate
her
slightest
want
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
brought
her
a
cup
of
water
he
shoved
aside
a
burning
branch
which
rolled
impudently
too
near
the
divine
foot
he
removed
the
offending
fish
from
under
her
nostrils
hastily
and
half
apologetically
he
piled
the
fire
high
when
he
saw
her
shiver
and
finally
when
she
pushed
her
cup
away
and
let
her
two
hands
drop
into
her
lap
he
gathered
the
dishes
and
carried
them
away
to
the
nearest
pool
to
wash
them
leaving
gloria
silent
and
thoughtful
brooding
over
his
fire
when
he
came
back
to
her
in
the
hush
of
the
first
hour
of
night
he
thought
that
he
understood
her
need
for
silence
and
spoke
only
infrequently
and
briefly
and
very
very
softly
calling
her
attention
now
to
the
last
lingering
light
upon
the
piney
ridge
behind
them
or
to
the
liquid
music
of
the
creek
which
with
the
coming
of
night
seemed
to
grow
clearer
and
finer
and
sweeter
or
finally
to
the
big
star
burning
gloriously
in
the
perfect
sky
and
now
he
said
taking
up
his
axe
i
am
going
to
make
for
my
the
finest
couch
for
tranquil
restful
sleep
that
mortal
ever
had
as
he
strode
away
toward
a
grove
of
firs
he
was
lost
to
her
eyes
before
he
had
gone
a
hundred
paces
the
night
came
so
swiftly
it
seemed
to
her
feverish
fancies
that
in
the
dark
the
big
tree
trunks
were
huddling
closer
together
in
a
moment
she
heard
the
sound
of
his
axe
striking
softly
through
green
juicy
branches
he
worked
swiftly
grudging
every
minute
away
from
her
and
then
with
his
arms
full
of
the
fragrant
balsamy
boughs
he
stopped
and
let
them
slip
down
to
the
ground
and
himself
sat
down
upon
a
log
and
filled
his
pipe
with
slow
fingers
force
himself
to
smoke
one
pipe
before
he
went
back
to
her
thinking
that
she
would
be
grateful
for
a
few
moments
alone
almost
with
the
first
puff
of
smoke
there
came
to
him
gloria
piercing
scream
his
heart
stopping
he
jumped
up
and
ran
through
the
trees
to
her
shouting
gloria
i
gloria
i
coming
what
is
it
gloria
was
cowering
against
the
nearest
tree
her
face
showing
frightened
in
the
firelight
her
eyes
wide
with
nervous
horror
there
is
something
there
in
the
bushes
she
cried
excitedly
i
heard
it
moving
he
looked
where
she
pointed
down
by
the
creek
just
waddling
back
into
the
alders
was
a
fat
old
porcupine
dimly
seen
in
the
fringe
of
the
but
king
did
not
laugh
his
first
impulse
upon
him
strengthened
by
gloria
helplessness
he
took
her
into
his
arms
holding
her
close
to
him
why
did
you
leave
me
asked
gloria
petulantly
so
long
he
had
been
away
from
her
fifteen
minutes
while
he
cut
an
armful
of
and
thereafter
filled
and
lighted
his
pipe
and
to
gloria
the
time
had
seemed
long
little
enough
of
love
confession
surely
but
a
golden
crumb
to
a
man
starving
love
he
drew
her
closer
their
faces
ruddy
with
each
tense
with
its
own
emotion
were
close
together
oh
cried
gloria
she
wrenched
away
from
him
violently
you
you
hurt
me
let
me
go
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
he
saw
her
shoulders
lift
and
droop
he
heard
her
sob
oh
i
was
a
fool
his
arms
had
dropped
to
his
sides
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
speechless
staring
at
her
as
across
a
chasm
gloria
he
said
bewildered
but
now
her
hands
too
were
at
her
sides
clenched
and
nervous
her
white
face
was
lifted
and
she
broke
out
passionately
into
hot
words
he
saw
her
breast
heaving
and
sensed
that
she
was
stirred
to
depths
never
until
now
plumbed
what
he
could
not
glimpse
were
the
vague
unreasonable
reasons
the
distorted
horrors
grinning
at
her
among
the
spaces
of
black
gloom
into
which
her
spirit
had
sunk
had
he
been
a
poet
a
creature
given
to
blue
devils
and
nightmare
conjecture
he
might
have
come
somewhere
near
an
understanding
but
being
plain
mark
king
a
straightforward
healthy
and
unjaundiced
man
his
comprehension
found
never
a
clue
to
a
condition
which
in
gloria
was
hardly
other
than
an
inevitable
result
of
all
that
had
gone
before
i
was
last
night
she
panted
there
was
no
way
to
turn
that
beast
of
a
man
drove
me
to
desperation
then
you
came
and
and
oh
i
wish
that
i
were
dead
incredulous
amazed
near
stupefied
he
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
i
do
understand
he
said
dully
after
a
long
silence
broken
only
by
a
tumble
and
frolic
of
the
water
and
gloria
quick
hard
breathing
he
strove
to
be
very
gentle
with
her
just
what
is
it
can
you
tell
me
dear
do
call
me
dear
like
that
she
cried
sharply
just
as
though
i
were
your
he
saw
the
roundness
of
her
eyes
she
shuddered
you
knew
that
i
was
driven
to
it
to
save
my
name
to
stop
hideous
gossip
in
her
disordered
mind
she
had
been
flung
as
upon
shoals
to
many
bleak
points
of
view
she
had
blamed
fate
for
her
undoing
she
had
blamed
gratton
she
had
laid
the
responsibility
upon
her
mother
for
having
allowed
her
to
drift
but
always
she
had
looked
upon
herself
as
the
victim
now
in
her
agitation
which
had
risen
close
to
hysteria
it
was
suddenly
mark
king
whom
she
blamed
for
everything
he
in
the
guise
of
fate
had
betrayed
her
you
saw
that
i
was
half
dead
with
terror
that
i
hardly
knew
what
i
was
doing
that
all
i
could
think
of
was
escape
from
the
horrible
trap
that
had
been
set
for
me
you
so
that
was
it
but
still
his
tone
was
utterly
devoid
of
any
emotion
save
that
of
incredulity
you
mean
you
did
love
me
gloria
when
did
you
ever
ask
me
if
i
loved
you
but
you
you
married
me
great
god
he
ran
his
hand
across
his
brow
as
though
to
brush
away
an
obsession
not
loving
me
you
married
me
just
to
save
yourself
from
possible
scandal
what
girl
would
she
cried
wildly
driven
as
i
was
he
tried
to
think
with
all
of
that
calm
deliberation
which
this
moment
so
plainly
required
in
mind
he
went
back
stage
by
stage
through
all
of
last
night
events
and
so
he
came
in
retrospect
in
due
time
to
the
moment
when
he
had
come
to
the
porch
and
had
looked
in
through
the
window
to
take
his
last
farewell
of
her
when
he
had
seen
her
standing
at
gratton
side
she
had
drooped
so
like
a
figure
of
despondency
she
had
lifted
her
head
slowly
at
the
judge
question
and
then
there
had
occurred
that
sudden
change
in
her
bearing
and
in
her
voice
alike
when
abruptly
she
had
cried
out
no
no
and
no
and
no
tell
me
said
king
heavily
when
you
refused
to
marry
gratton
last
night
did
you
know
that
i
was
outside
yes
she
answered
she
wondered
why
he
asked
there
was
a
mirror
i
saw
your
reflection
in
it
if
i
had
not
come
would
you
have
gone
on
with
the
thing
he
hesitated
then
said
harshly
would
you
have
married
him
i
do
know
oh
she
exclaimed
twisting
at
her
hands
how
can
i
tell
what
i
would
have
done
driven
one
way
torn
another
you
might
have
married
him
you
but
chose
me
as
the
lesser
of
two
evils
was
that
it
i
tell
you
i
do
know
i
only
know
that
i
was
hideously
compromised
i
would
never
have
dared
show
my
face
again
in
san
francisco
anywhere
it
would
have
killed
me
and
even
yet
there
was
in
king
face
only
a
queer
tortured
incredulity
for
a
long
time
neither
moved
nor
spoke
his
eyes
were
on
her
hers
intently
on
him
when
he
answered
it
was
in
a
voice
from
which
all
of
joyousness
had
fled
i
going
to
make
your
bed
gloria
he
said
evenly
near
the
fire
which
i
keep
going
i
make
mine
on
the
outside
so
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
any
prowling
animal
then
in
the
morning
we
will
talk
she
watched
him
go
back
for
his
scattered
and
even
gloria
noted
how
heavy
was
his
walk
but
she
could
not
guess
how
when
he
was
alone
with
his
trees
and
the
darkness
dropped
curtainwise
between
him
and
her
he
went
down
on
both
knees
and
buried
his
face
in
one
of
those
same
fallen
sprays
from
the
fir
flat
on
his
back
lay
mark
king
his
hands
under
his
head
his
eyes
upon
the
slow
procession
of
the
stars
just
so
had
he
lain
many
a
night
in
the
but
life
then
and
now
were
as
two
distinct
existences
which
had
nothing
in
common
but
were
set
apart
in
two
separate
worlds
remote
one
from
the
other
now
he
saw
the
stars
as
it
were
with
the
physical
eye
alone
merely
because
they
blazed
so
bright
against
the
darkness
above
him
he
was
scarcely
conscious
of
their
gleam
and
sparkle
of
old
he
had
been
wont
to
commune
with
them
through
the
long
years
they
had
woven
themselves
into
his
religion
countless
times
had
he
watched
them
and
mused
and
hearkened
to
the
message
which
as
with
a
still
voice
infinitely
calming
travelled
to
him
across
the
limitless
vastitude
of
the
universe
countless
times
that
voice
had
called
him
away
from
the
toils
and
victories
and
defeats
of
the
day
up
into
a
place
of
quiet
from
which
a
man
might
look
about
him
with
a
somewhat
truer
perspective
he
glimpsed
futility
in
much
of
human
strife
and
striving
he
saw
nobility
enshrined
in
a
small
act
he
marked
how
set
in
the
scales
of
the
eternal
balances
of
scope
and
eternity
a
copper
penny
set
against
a
million
dollars
were
as
two
feathers
they
rode
light
and
there
was
little
choice
between
them
he
had
known
that
firefly
cluster
of
lights
above
to
be
the
majestic
processional
of
worlds
he
saw
himself
as
small
the
universe
as
big
and
the
knowledge
did
not
crush
it
elevated
throughout
the
whole
of
creation
ran
the
fine
chain
of
divine
ordinance
of
a
law
that
flowered
in
beauty
there
was
god
work
above
him
about
him
within
him
and
god
stood
back
of
it
all
vouching
for
it
making
it
good
the
spinning
of
worlds
the
pulses
of
tides
the
course
of
the
blood
in
his
veins
these
were
kindred
phenomena
the
law
of
god
bound
about
with
its
fine
chain
of
divine
will
and
love
the
greater
and
the
lesser
bodies
moving
through
the
universe
upon
such
a
comprehension
brotherhood
of
man
and
tree
and
sun
and
flower
had
been
raised
mark
king
haphazard
edifice
of
a
theory
of
life
the
stars
reminded
him
that
through
the
eons
all
had
been
right
with
the
world
of
worlds
they
sang
of
hope
and
happiness
and
beauty
they
showed
a
man
the
way
to
rich
full
contentment
they
lighted
the
path
to
generous
dealings
with
other
men
they
threw
their
searchlight
upon
the
day
a
man
had
just
done
with
and
set
him
thinking
they
led
his
thoughts
ahead
to
the
day
soon
to
dawn
making
him
wish
to
make
a
better
job
of
things
but
between
him
and
his
beloved
stars
stretched
a
region
of
shadows
through
which
the
eyes
of
his
soul
did
not
look
something
within
him
had
been
stricken
sorely
wounded
beaten
to
its
knees
chilled
with
death
he
sought
to
think
quite
calmly
and
for
a
long
time
clear
consecutive
thought
was
beyond
his
reach
a
moment
had
come
when
he
could
only
he
was
swept
this
way
and
that
he
had
given
to
gloria
his
love
without
stint
without
reservation
without
limit
the
love
which
no
other
woman
had
ever
awakened
had
poured
itself
out
before
gloria
like
a
flood
of
clear
swift
water
breaking
free
he
loved
after
the
only
fashion
possible
to
him
with
his
whole
heart
and
soul
with
his
whole
being
he
adored
he
made
of
his
beloved
a
princess
a
goddess
he
saw
her
upon
a
plane
where
no
woman
ever
lived
in
an
atmosphere
too
rare
for
humanity
a
man
does
not
love
through
human
reason
rather
through
a
reason
hidden
even
to
him
deeper
than
humanity
then
gloria
had
put
her
hand
into
his
gloria
had
married
him
gloria
had
elected
to
come
with
him
after
that
he
had
seen
nothing
in
its
true
light
gloria
had
remade
the
world
into
paradise
ineffable
he
had
been
on
the
heights
lifted
among
the
stars
and
without
warning
without
mercy
the
world
had
crashed
about
him
from
the
zenith
to
the
nadir
small
wonder
that
thoughts
did
not
come
logically
he
floundered
lost
crushed
bewildered
just
yonder
on
the
bed
of
he
had
made
for
her
lay
gloria
he
did
not
look
that
way
the
wind
was
rising
he
heard
it
go
rushing
through
the
it
struck
with
sudden
relentless
impact
it
set
the
shivering
needles
to
shrill
whistling
it
made
the
staunch
old
trunks
shudder
he
heard
the
canvas
by
gloria
bed
above
him
tossing
boughs
scraped
and
creaked
one
thing
only
seemed
clear
to
him
the
time
had
come
when
a
man
must
seek
to
hold
himself
in
check
when
he
must
not
leap
when
he
must
strive
with
all
the
stubborn
will
in
him
to
reserve
judgment
his
own
life
crisis
had
come
to
him
revealing
itself
with
the
blinding
swiftness
of
a
flash
of
lightning
a
step
forward
or
back
now
would
be
one
step
toward
which
his
entire
destiny
from
the
hour
of
birth
until
now
had
led
him
there
would
be
no
retracing
it
it
would
be
final
and
everything
everything
was
at
stake
he
must
think
he
must
try
to
understand
all
that
gloria
had
experienced
to
see
what
impulses
had
moved
her
to
make
allowances
for
her
to
come
to
read
aright
what
lay
in
her
heart
he
must
see
clearly
into
two
human
hearts
task
for
the
gods
as
though
the
wilderness
about
him
were
a
colossal
malevolent
entity
endowed
with
the
power
to
look
into
human
breasts
it
jeered
at
him
with
its
voice
of
the
wind
he
had
but
half
a
mind
to
give
to
physical
senses
though
the
wind
howled
all
night
long
he
scarce
was
conscious
of
it
though
the
cold
increased
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
cold
before
he
had
grown
numb
he
had
given
to
gloria
all
of
their
bedding
save
alone
the
one
blanket
he
had
wrapped
about
him
he
had
kept
on
all
his
clothing
buttoned
up
his
coat
and
forgotten
that
he
was
not
warmly
covered
now
he
got
up
and
walked
up
and
down
he
made
the
fire
blaze
up
he
sat
huddled
over
it
until
it
burned
down
to
a
bed
of
glowing
red
coals
once
or
twice
he
heard
gloria
stir
restlessly
upon
her
bed
but
he
did
not
speak
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
between
them
now
they
would
wait
until
she
had
rested
until
morning
then
there
would
be
no
more
delay
they
would
understand
each
other
then
as
few
men
and
women
had
understood
there
would
be
plain
words
and
but
few
of
them
he
grew
impatient
for
morning
and
sat
looking
forward
to
its
coming
with
a
face
set
and
hard
growing
as
stern
as
death
gloria
exhausted
had
gone
to
sleep
snuggled
warmly
into
her
blankets
it
was
the
wind
that
awoke
her
she
started
wide
awake
her
heart
in
her
throat
startled
by
the
flapping
of
the
canvas
at
her
head
she
lay
still
and
looked
up
the
pines
were
black
and
swayed
dismally
the
wind
among
them
made
shuddersome
music
the
cold
began
to
drive
through
her
blankets
through
her
clothing
her
body
was
stiff
and
sore
the
branches
of
fir
under
her
hurt
her
through
the
canvas
and
one
blanket
which
covered
them
she
turned
twisting
into
a
position
of
less
discomfort
the
creek
babbled
and
splashed
its
voice
merged
with
the
wilds
into
a
bleak
cheerless
duet
she
lifted
her
head
a
little
the
fire
was
dying
out
and
king
had
gone
the
darkness
bore
down
upon
her
she
heard
everywhere
vague
sounds
noises
as
of
stealthy
feet
she
knew
a
moment
of
blind
terror
she
tried
to
cry
out
but
only
a
little
choking
gasp
resulted
she
saw
something
moving
a
vague
formless
dreadful
something
and
lay
back
chilled
with
fright
it
was
king
he
was
bringing
fresh
fuel
she
sank
back
and
again
looked
up
at
the
pines
swaying
against
the
field
of
stars
she
began
to
shiver
a
nervous
chill
she
felt
the
slow
tears
form
and
spill
over
and
trickle
down
her
cheeks
she
gathered
her
nether
lip
between
her
teeth
and
lay
very
still
shaken
now
and
then
by
a
noiseless
sob
she
existed
through
a
period
of
suppressed
excitement
if
king
found
cool
logic
eluding
him
gloria
mind
was
an
orgy
of
nervous
imaginings
she
was
back
with
her
mother
weeping
sobbing
out
upon
a
comforting
breast
all
of
her
hideous
adventures
she
was
reading
the
tall
headlines
in
the
newspapers
she
was
commenting
on
them
with
simulated
flippancy
to
georgia
and
ernestine
she
was
meeting
gratton
for
the
first
time
again
treating
him
to
such
haughty
disdain
as
put
hot
blood
into
his
white
face
she
was
standing
erect
in
the
morning
confronting
mark
king
fearlessly
demanding
her
rights
commanding
that
he
take
her
home
and
piteously
lonely
and
frightened
she
was
longing
to
have
him
come
to
her
now
to
put
his
arms
about
her
to
hold
her
tight
to
set
his
fearless
body
between
hers
and
the
vague
and
terrible
menaces
of
the
night
and
the
jeering
night
voices
she
heard
a
twig
snap
her
heart
beat
wildly
she
wondered
what
she
would
do
when
he
came
and
she
saw
that
he
sat
motionless
by
the
fire
the
night
wore
on
she
dozed
now
and
then
fitfully
awakened
always
rudely
by
unaccustomed
noises
or
by
the
cold
or
the
discomfort
of
her
bed
she
put
her
hand
to
her
cheek
wondering
if
she
were
going
to
be
feverish
her
face
was
cold
she
saw
that
king
had
lighted
his
pipe
she
wanted
to
scream
at
him
how
she
hated
him
for
that
that
he
could
smoke
while
she
lay
here
in
such
wretchedness
made
her
briefly
hot
with
anger
he
was
a
man
and
sweepingly
she
told
herself
that
she
loathed
all
mankind
she
accused
him
of
heartlessness
of
lack
of
understanding
of
brutal
lack
of
sympathy
he
and
he
alone
was
responsible
for
everything
that
vague
terrible
he
sat
there
as
still
as
a
rooted
tree
he
bulked
big
through
the
gloom
like
a
rugged
boulder
he
was
a
part
of
this
wild
land
as
indifferent
as
cold
as
merciless
the
thought
now
that
he
might
come
to
her
made
her
quake
with
fear
she
was
afraid
of
him
if
she
could
only
sleep
no
sleep
little
the
night
before
less
the
night
before
that
no
wonder
her
brain
swirled
if
all
this
had
happened
at
any
other
time
she
was
a
bundle
of
nerves
nerves
that
vibrated
at
the
slightest
suggestion
she
was
going
to
be
perhaps
the
end
of
it
would
be
that
she
would
die
all
of
the
misshapen
monstrous
fancies
which
are
bred
of
a
sleepless
and
nervous
night
made
for
her
a
period
of
such
stress
that
as
the
hours
wore
on
they
blanched
her
cheeks
and
put
dark
shadows
under
her
eyes
and
taunted
her
with
longings
for
a
rest
which
they
denied
her
thus
in
the
stern
grips
of
their
destinies
mark
king
and
gloria
lived
through
the
night
two
uncertain
spirits
awaiting
the
light
of
day
and
thus
their
brains
those
finite
organs
upon
which
mankind
entrusts
the
ordering
of
great
events
prepared
themselves
for
the
moment
when
they
must
grapple
with
and
decide
a
matter
of
supreme
moment
and
all
night
the
wind
like
a
hateful
voice
jeered
at
four
that
chill
morning
king
began
the
day
he
saw
that
gloria
was
awake
and
sitting
up
looking
straight
ahead
of
her
he
gave
no
sign
of
having
noted
her
but
busied
himself
in
a
swift
silent
sort
of
way
with
and
breakfast
preparation
gloria
in
turn
saw
him
she
experienced
aloof
wonder
at
the
look
on
his
face
he
was
haggard
his
mouth
was
set
and
hard
she
had
thought
to
be
thankful
when
daylight
came
now
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
fire
rubbing
her
cold
hands
together
looking
at
an
awakened
world
with
dull
eyes
it
was
not
yet
full
day
what
light
filtered
down
here
into
this
sheltered
spot
was
cheerless
as
it
drew
forest
details
out
of
the
thinning
shadows
it
seemed
to
be
painting
them
in
cold
grey
monotones
upon
a
cold
grey
world
he
and
she
when
he
came
back
with
an
of
wood
looked
straight
into
each
other
eyes
long
and
soberly
searchingly
and
hopelessly
after
that
they
did
not
again
look
into
each
other
faces
no
had
passed
between
them
since
both
sensed
that
any
time
for
empty
civilities
had
gone
there
could
be
no
conventional
pretence
at
harmony
even
in
small
things
they
must
be
in
each
other
arms
or
worlds
apart
out
of
a
night
grappling
with
chimeras
king
had
come
to
one
and
only
one
determination
he
would
go
slowly
he
would
hold
an
iron
check
upon
himself
he
would
throttle
down
a
temper
which
more
than
once
in
his
life
at
moments
of
tempest
had
blazed
out
uncontrollably
he
would
smother
within
himself
that
passion
which
in
forthright
men
is
so
prone
to
burst
into
violence
were
gloria
to
show
herself
to
be
this
or
that
were
she
to
say
this
word
or
another
he
would
speak
with
her
coolly
he
would
listen
to
her
calmly
and
in
the
end
since
judge
he
must
he
would
judge
with
his
heart
ordered
to
beat
steadily
and
not
with
a
wild
rush
of
blood
he
had
set
a
guard
in
his
own
breast
as
he
might
have
set
a
guard
over
a
camp
of
treacherous
enemies
yet
from
the
outset
nothing
was
more
unlikely
than
that
these
two
should
advance
by
smooth
paths
to
a
clear
and
utter
understanding
his
one
glimpse
of
her
face
dethroned
his
cold
logic
and
moved
him
very
deeply
she
was
so
white
so
pitifully
she
too
had
suffered
god
knew
that
she
had
battled
through
hours
of
anguish
he
wanted
her
in
his
arms
he
wanted
to
batter
at
the
world
with
his
fists
to
save
her
from
its
flings
of
grief
and
pain
he
bit
savagely
at
his
lip
and
turned
away
and
she
seeing
his
haggard
eyes
his
drawn
face
knew
that
she
had
been
unjust
last
night
when
she
had
hated
him
for
seeming
a
soulless
man
who
could
smoke
his
pipe
in
all
serenity
and
feel
nothing
of
the
unhappiness
of
the
night
he
did
not
look
like
the
mark
king
of
yesterday
the
glad
gleam
of
joy
had
died
in
his
eyes
the
quick
resiliency
had
gone
out
of
his
step
he
too
had
lived
through
slow
hours
of
torture
he
did
love
her
she
could
never
doubt
that
had
he
suddenly
caught
her
to
him
then
had
he
crushed
her
close
in
his
arms
had
he
cried
out
in
headlong
passion
that
she
love
him
that
he
would
make
her
love
him
that
she
was
his
that
he
would
not
give
her
up
would
she
have
wrenched
away
from
him
hot
with
anger
or
would
she
have
crept
close
and
known
at
last
whether
or
not
she
loved
him
but
here
was
something
else
she
could
not
know
he
turned
and
went
off
for
his
wood
she
crouched
shivering
by
the
fire
they
breakfasted
in
silence
the
fire
between
them
neither
did
much
more
than
drink
the
strong
coffee
gloria
sat
tossing
bits
of
bread
into
the
fire
it
was
on
his
lips
to
tell
her
not
to
do
that
waste
in
the
wilderness
is
a
crime
but
he
held
his
words
back
he
went
methodically
about
camp
work
cleaned
the
plates
and
cups
and
pans
remade
the
two
packs
all
this
time
she
did
not
stir
at
last
he
came
back
to
her
and
stood
by
the
dying
fire
ominously
silent
she
grew
nervously
restive
wishing
that
he
would
say
something
there
a
day
work
to
be
done
he
said
at
last
his
voice
meant
to
be
impersonal
was
only
stern
that
means
an
early
start
and
is
it
very
much
further
to
the
caves
she
asked
he
had
paused
she
had
to
say
something
it
will
take
a
long
day
getting
there
you
see
we
did
come
very
far
yesterday
this
she
supposed
was
a
fling
at
her
and
she
stiffened
under
it
but
when
she
spoke
it
was
to
ignore
the
innuendo
intended
or
not
for
wherever
they
might
be
led
she
hoped
it
would
not
be
into
sordid
quarrelling
it
begins
to
be
rather
obvious
that
i
should
not
have
come
it
she
asked
well
now
if
i
turn
back
to
the
house
and
then
to
mamma
and
papa
in
coloma
and
then
to
san
francisco
and
i
if
you
would
go
with
me
as
far
as
the
house
she
saw
how
his
body
straightened
how
his
broad
shoulders
squared
there
was
something
eloquent
in
the
gesture
mark
king
with
no
toleration
of
a
clutter
of
side
issues
came
straight
to
the
main
barrier
which
must
be
swept
aside
for
good
and
all
or
which
must
be
skirted
and
so
passed
and
relegated
to
the
limbo
of
dead
hopes
do
you
love
me
gloria
he
demanded
as
lovers
love
as
i
have
loved
you
as
a
wife
should
love
her
husband
did
i
explain
all
of
that
last
night
she
said
petulantly
must
we
go
over
it
all
again
if
i
have
have
pained
you
i
am
sorry
i
say
any
more
than
that
can
i
i
thought
i
made
you
see
how
i
was
placed
how
there
was
but
the
one
thing
for
me
to
do
marry
gratton
or
me
and
you
chose
me
she
hesitated
she
knew
that
he
was
angry
though
he
gave
so
little
outward
sign
nor
did
she
fail
to
recognize
that
he
had
grounds
for
anger
but
none
the
less
she
resented
his
insistent
questionings
she
stood
looking
blankly
at
him
if
she
had
only
obeyed
her
straightforward
impulse
at
the
house
to
go
to
him
and
explain
her
predicament
i
intended
she
began
in
a
low
strange
voice
to
go
to
you
to
tell
you
answer
me
he
said
sternly
yes
or
no
did
you
marry
me
without
love
and
just
to
save
yourself
from
possible
gossip
of
being
alone
all
night
with
a
man
is
that
why
you
married
me
yes
or
no
to
gloria
as
to
king
the
issue
was
clear
and
not
to
be
clouded
to
her
credit
be
it
said
that
she
wasted
no
time
in
fruitless
evasion
this
matter
would
demand
settlement
as
well
now
as
later
there
was
wisdom
in
ending
all
unpleasantness
once
and
for
ever
yes
she
answered
defiantly
then
suddenly
it
was
given
her
to
see
a
mark
king
she
had
never
dreamed
of
a
mark
king
of
blazing
wrath
thrusting
aside
the
man
whom
she
knew
and
who
had
held
himself
in
check
and
throttled
down
his
emotion
until
she
spoke
that
quiet
yes
the
word
was
like
a
spark
to
a
train
of
gunpowder
his
determination
to
beat
down
his
temper
no
matter
what
came
was
gone
his
memory
of
her
ordeals
was
wiped
out
from
his
whole
tense
being
there
flashed
out
upon
her
a
hot
heady
anger
like
stabbing
lightning
from
an
ominous
cloud
his
few
words
seared
and
scorched
a
place
in
her
memory
to
endure
always
he
clenched
his
hands
and
raised
them
for
an
instant
she
thought
he
was
going
to
strike
her
down
you
are
utterly
contemptible
he
shouted
at
her
and
i
am
done
with
you
he
turned
and
left
her
gloria
stared
after
him
in
amazement
she
saw
how
he
walked
swiftly
his
big
boots
crunching
through
the
gravel
down
by
the
creek
bed
splashing
through
the
water
carrying
him
up
the
timbered
slope
toward
the
horses
she
could
not
know
that
he
was
almost
running
because
he
was
telling
himself
in
his
fierce
white
passion
that
unless
he
left
her
thus
he
would
lose
the
last
power
of
restraint
and
set
his
hands
to
her
throat
and
choke
her
until
the
last
second
he
had
sought
not
to
condemn
too
soon
now
after
his
fashion
he
condemned
sweepingly
for
the
moment
he
held
that
she
was
less
to
him
than
the
grime
upon
his
boots
when
he
came
to
the
horses
he
was
white
with
anger
he
lifted
his
hand
and
looked
at
his
fingers
queerly
they
were
trembling
he
cursed
himself
for
a
fool
shut
the
hand
into
a
hard
fist
as
steady
as
rock
and
for
an
instant
glared
at
it
blackly
then
he
opened
the
fingers
slowly
a
hard
smile
made
his
mouth
ugly
and
left
it
cruel
the
fingers
had
hearkened
to
a
superb
will
and
gave
no
greater
hint
of
trembling
than
did
the
nigged
hole
of
the
giant
cedar
under
which
he
stood
he
coiled
his
horse
and
led
him
back
to
camp
as
he
drew
near
gloria
promptly
turned
her
back
and
studied
her
nails
she
had
had
encounters
with
men
before
now
and
had
not
yet
gauged
the
profundity
of
this
man
emotion
she
counted
fully
on
bringing
him
to
a
full
and
contrite
sense
of
his
crime
before
she
condescended
so
much
as
to
look
at
him
but
when
she
flashed
him
a
quick
furtive
glance
she
saw
that
he
had
his
back
upon
her
and
that
he
gave
neither
hint
of
softening
nor
yet
of
knowledge
of
her
presence
he
bridled
the
buckskin
saddled
tied
his
rope
at
the
and
began
making
his
pack
she
watched
uneasy
and
concerned
but
not
yet
fully
understanding
but
when
she
noted
how
he
took
from
their
one
cup
one
plate
one
knife
and
fork
only
how
he
did
not
appear
interested
in
the
which
she
knew
had
been
brought
for
her
how
he
left
half
of
the
coffee
and
bacon
and
sugar
a
strange
alarm
came
over
her
she
glanced
wildly
around
the
forest
glowered
darkly
the
silence
was
overpowering
the
loneliness
bewildering
he
was
going
to
leave
her
she
had
not
the
faintest
idea
in
the
world
where
the
trail
lay
king
went
swiftly
about
his
preparations
he
did
not
even
see
her
he
studiously
kept
his
eyes
aloof
within
his
soul
he
swore
that
he
would
never
look
at
her
again
took
up
his
rifle
gloria
stirred
uneasily
she
did
not
like
to
yield
to
him
even
to
the
extent
of
saying
a
stiff
word
but
she
felt
that
the
man
was
not
playing
a
part
and
that
in
another
moment
she
would
be
alone
you
are
not
going
to
leave
me
here
alone
are
you
she
demanded
coldly
i
am
going
on
was
his
curt
rejoinder
and
i
she
persisted
what
you
please
he
went
on
with
his
preparations
terror
sprang
up
into
the
heart
i
would
never
find
my
way
out
she
cried
jumping
to
her
feet
and
coming
toward
him
i
am
not
used
to
the
mountains
i
do
know
which
way
i
would
die
to
be
rid
of
you
the
easiest
way
he
returned
bluntly
i
would
turn
back
with
you
until
we
got
within
striking
distance
of
the
open
but
you
have
made
me
waste
time
as
it
is
and
i
promised
ben
that
i
be
in
gus
ingle
caves
with
no
time
lost
so
i
am
going
on
but
and
all
of
her
surging
terror
trembled
in
her
rushing
words
i
would
die
i
tell
you
and
i
tell
you
he
snapped
back
at
her
that
i
do
care
a
damn
if
you
do
must
i
tell
you
twice
that
i
am
through
with
you
he
set
his
foot
to
the
stirrup
gloria
pride
lost
in
panic
ran
to
him
and
grasped
his
arm
crying
to
him
you
must
leave
me
this
way
it
brutal
it
murder
i
gave
my
promise
to
ben
he
said
you
are
not
worth
breaking
a
promise
if
you
wo
take
me
back
then
let
me
go
with
you
worthless
and
selfish
and
cowardly
useless
and
vain
and
brainless
good
god
am
i
a
man
full
grown
to
loiter
on
the
trail
with
the
like
of
you
let
go
he
shook
her
hand
off
roughly
and
swung
up
into
the
saddle
sending
his
horse
with
a
in
the
flank
down
to
the
ford
but
gloria
screamed
after
him
and
ran
after
him
down
to
the
creek
and
through
it
calling
out
mark
mark
for
god
sake
do
leave
me
i
am
afraid
i
will
die
of
fear
take
me
with
you
he
did
not
look
back
at
her
but
he
did
pause
after
all
she
was
the
daughter
of
his
old
friend
the
woods
are
free
and
open
he
said
slowly
to
even
such
as
you
for
the
third
time
and
for
the
last
i
tell
you
this
i
am
done
with
you
but
if
you
like
you
may
follow
behind
me
i
will
wait
for
you
ten
minutes
not
here
but
on
the
ridge
up
there
and
if
you
have
not
come
i
will
go
on
at
the
end
of
that
time
that
is
my
solemn
word
gloria
gaynor
he
rode
from
her
straight
and
massive
in
the
saddle
up
the
slope
among
the
trees
and
in
a
trice
out
of
sight
she
stood
like
one
in
a
sudden
trance
then
with
an
inarticulate
moan
she
ran
into
the
grove
and
grasped
blackie
rope
and
dragged
at
him
trying
to
make
him
run
with
her
to
her
saddle
and
few
belongings
the
saddle
nearly
overmastered
her
it
was
heavy
and
she
knew
as
little
of
it
as
did
any
city
girl
but
her
need
was
sore
and
her
young
body
not
without
supple
strength
in
half
of
the
allotted
time
gloria
came
riding
up
the
ridge
now
king
glanced
toward
her
briefly
but
less
at
her
than
at
her
pack
you
had
better
go
back
for
the
rest
of
the
grub
he
said
to
her
and
for
your
that
would
be
my
advice
to
the
devil
himself
you
can
do
it
in
the
five
minutes
left
to
you
gloria
flung
up
her
head
opened
her
lips
for
a
stinging
reply
and
then
held
for
a
moment
in
silence
and
hesitation
you
hideous
brute
she
flung
at
him
but
none
the
less
she
hastened
back
for
her
outfit
five
minutes
later
they
rode
on
into
the
wilderness
she
just
keeping
his
form
in
sight
he
never
turning
nor
speaking
for
his
brutal
treatment
of
her
gloria
fully
meant
that
in
the
ripeness
of
time
he
should
pay
to
the
uttermost
after
that
first
panic
she
felt
toward
king
only
such
anger
as
she
had
never
experienced
before
never
having
cause
for
it
perhaps
the
emotion
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
for
her
certainly
here
was
a
moment
of
reversion
to
a
condition
of
unplumbed
progenital
influences
the
scorching
anger
arising
from
such
a
primitive
situation
was
in
itself
primal
hence
the
emotion
no
less
that
the
experience
itself
was
novel
clean
searing
anger
following
this
emotion
which
rode
her
and
sapped
her
nervous
strength
came
a
period
of
faintness
and
nausea
she
closed
her
eyes
and
dropped
her
head
and
clung
to
the
horn
of
her
saddle
with
hands
which
went
cold
and
shook
in
this
mood
she
called
out
once
to
king
but
he
was
far
ahead
and
did
not
turn
she
did
not
know
whether
he
had
heard
her
gradually
the
weakness
passed
they
topped
the
ridge
and
the
sun
wanned
her
coolly
and
collectedly
she
turned
her
thoughts
upon
the
insufferable
insult
and
came
back
through
a
sort
of
circle
to
her
first
intention
now
the
decision
was
cold
and
stubborn
he
would
pay
and
in
full
king
led
the
way
unfalteringly
time
and
again
she
saw
no
hint
of
a
trail
underfoot
or
ahead
they
broke
through
brush
or
made
a
difficult
way
through
a
thicket
of
alders
or
willows
and
invariably
came
again
upon
a
trail
it
was
evident
that
the
man
thought
only
of
his
end
and
was
hastening
hence
he
took
all
the
short
cuts
which
he
knew
in
one
of
these
pathless
places
where
the
and
tangle
of
brush
were
above
her
head
where
it
seemed
that
she
must
smother
she
lost
all
sight
of
him
her
horse
came
to
a
dead
halt
she
listened
and
could
not
hear
the
hoofs
of
his
horse
again
panic
mastered
her
and
she
cried
out
wildly
but
just
ahead
was
a
mad
mountain
stream
filling
the
gorge
with
its
thunder
she
knew
that
king
could
not
hear
her
she
felt
the
desperate
certainty
that
he
would
not
heed
could
he
hear
then
she
struck
her
horse
frantically
with
her
bare
hands
and
pounded
him
with
her
heels
longing
for
the
sight
of
king
as
one
athirst
in
the
bad
lands
longs
for
water
the
horse
snorted
and
whirling
and
plunging
went
ripping
through
the
bushes
which
whipped
at
her
and
tore
the
skin
of
hands
and
face
but
in
three
minutes
he
brought
her
into
the
open
and
into
full
sight
of
king
riding
up
a
gentle
slope
through
big
cedars
when
her
fear
died
as
it
did
swiftly
after
the
way
of
fear
it
left
not
the
old
hot
anger
but
a
new
elemental
emotion
cold
hatred
thus
upon
their
second
morning
the
honeymoon
entered
upon
its
second
phase
every
moment
brought
some
new
discomfort
to
her
the
saddle
hurt
her
her
clothes
were
torn
her
tender
skin
bruised
and
scratched
pains
came
stabbingly
with
early
fatigue
as
for
king
he
had
come
abruptly
to
look
down
upon
her
as
utterly
despicable
being
a
man
of
high
honour
he
convicted
her
out
of
hand
as
one
without
honour
despising
her
he
despised
himself
for
having
linked
his
life
in
ever
so
little
with
hers
but
yesterday
he
had
knelt
to
her
humbly
in
his
innermost
heart
of
hearts
now
he
sought
to
shut
his
mind
against
her
quite
as
definitely
as
he
turned
his
back
on
her
what
sombre
misshapen
edifice
they
should
build
upon
these
of
hate
and
contempt
was
a
matter
into
which
no
conjecture
could
enter
even
slightly
had
their
compelling
environment
been
different
in
the
city
they
would
have
turned
their
backs
and
walked
away
from
each
other
but
two
men
upon
a
raft
separate
until
land
is
sighted
gloria
at
least
was
in
her
present
plight
comparable
to
a
shipwrecked
sailor
of
little
skill
and
less
resource
hence
what
was
to
be
remained
to
be
seen
at
ten
the
air
was
and
sweet
half
an
hour
later
the
genial
day
was
made
over
by
the
high
wind
trailing
vapours
into
a
chill
bleak
sky
they
had
climbed
to
fresh
altitudes
the
timber
through
which
they
progressed
indicated
that
a
height
of
at
least
seven
thousand
feet
above
had
been
passed
they
passed
through
groves
of
the
tamaracks
came
at
the
base
of
a
rugged
slope
to
scattering
mountain
pines
which
reared
into
lusty
perfection
on
bleak
levels
where
many
of
their
companion
growths
were
beginning
to
run
out
in
dwarfed
twisted
misery
and
came
to
a
rocky
pass
through
the
mountains
where
on
all
sides
the
red
cedar
the
juniper
of
the
sierra
throve
hardily
among
bare
boulders
crowning
the
lofty
crests
like
a
sparse
stiff
hirsute
display
upon
the
gigantic
body
of
the
world
the
dwarf
pine
lingered
here
straggling
along
the
slopes
beaten
down
by
many
a
winter
of
wind
and
heavy
snow
but
by
noon
they
had
made
a
slow
tedious
way
down
a
rocky
ridge
and
were
once
more
in
the
heart
of
the
upper
forest
belt
in
an
upland
meadow
through
whose
narrow
boundaries
a
thin
cold
stream
trickled
they
nooned
long
had
gloria
hungered
for
the
moment
when
she
would
see
king
swing
down
from
the
saddle
during
the
last
she
had
begun
to
fear
that
his
brutality
knew
no
bounds
and
that
he
would
spare
neither
the
horses
nor
her
but
crowd
on
until
nightfall
when
he
did
dismount
by
the
creek
she
drew
rein
fifty
feet
from
him
king
slipped
buck
bridle
dropped
the
and
let
the
animal
forage
along
the
fringes
of
the
brook
to
gloria
in
a
voice
which
struck
her
as
being
as
chill
as
the
grey
overcast
sky
he
said
better
let
your
horse
eat
we
got
to
go
pretty
steady
to
get
anywhere
gloria
got
down
stiffly
from
her
saddle
in
all
the
days
of
her
life
she
had
never
been
so
unutterably
weary
further
she
was
faint
from
hunger
and
her
throat
pained
her
she
went
to
the
creek
and
threw
herself
down
and
put
her
face
into
the
cool
water
from
which
she
rose
with
a
long
sigh
she
had
seen
how
king
did
with
his
she
did
similarly
but
was
too
tired
to
trouble
with
removing
the
bit
from
her
mouth
still
blackie
accepted
his
handicapped
opportunity
and
joined
buck
in
tearing
and
ripping
at
the
lush
grass
it
was
more
inviting
than
the
and
occasional
at
which
he
had
snatched
during
the
day
king
made
coffee
and
fried
bacon
the
horses
had
earned
an
hour
of
rest
and
fodder
and
a
man
has
the
right
to
bacon
and
coffee
even
though
hard
miles
lie
before
him
while
he
pottered
with
his
fire
he
looked
more
than
once
at
the
sky
in
the
with
all
of
his
heart
he
wished
that
he
had
turned
back
with
gloria
this
morning
by
now
he
could
have
set
her
feet
in
a
trail
which
even
a
fool
could
travel
back
to
the
log
house
and
he
could
be
again
hastening
upon
his
errand
gloria
lay
inert
she
chewed
slowly
at
a
bit
broken
from
a
slab
of
hard
chocolate
and
kept
her
eyes
closed
her
face
was
very
white
two
big
tears
of
distress
slipped
out
from
the
shut
lids
but
king
did
not
come
close
enough
to
see
them
when
his
coffee
was
ready
he
called
to
her
saying
indifferently
better
have
a
cup
it
helps
but
gloria
did
not
reply
king
seemed
not
to
notice
whether
she
ate
or
not
but
when
he
had
drunk
his
own
coffee
and
she
still
lay
quiet
on
the
grass
he
sweetened
a
cup
for
her
put
some
milk
in
it
and
set
it
at
her
elbow
better
drink
it
he
said
coldly
and
gloria
gathered
her
strength
and
sat
up
and
drank
thereafter
she
ate
some
bread
and
potted
ham
fragments
of
bread
the
crust
and
half
of
the
ham
she
threw
away
king
opened
his
mouth
to
protest
then
shrugged
and
remained
silent
his
back
to
a
tree
he
sat
and
smoked
until
the
hour
had
passed
precisely
at
one
they
were
on
their
way
gloria
caught
her
own
horse
coiled
the
rope
and
mounted
as
king
rode
across
the
meadow
and
to
the
wooded
slope
beyond
she
followed
it
seemed
to
her
that
this
was
all
a
dream
she
was
almost
the
sternest
of
realities
began
to
seem
impalpable
and
distant
and
of
scant
moment
she
knew
that
she
was
going
forward
because
she
must
that
otherwise
she
would
lie
here
in
the
lonely
wilderness
and
die
in
her
exhaustion
she
noted
as
one
does
note
his
own
when
overwrought
that
the
prospect
of
death
seemed
less
terrible
than
that
of
utter
desertion
the
mountains
were
so
big
they
stifled
her
with
every
tortuous
step
forward
this
formidable
land
all
about
her
had
grown
more
severe
more
lonely
more
to
her
like
the
kingdom
of
desolation
than
she
had
ever
dreamed
existed
there
were
slope
fields
strewn
with
black
lava
rock
where
never
a
solitary
blade
of
grass
upthrust
a
thin
spear
there
were
broken
expanses
across
which
the
eye
might
travel
wearily
for
what
appeared
endless
miles
one
could
call
out
here
with
never
a
faint
hope
of
being
heard
one
left
alone
here
could
die
miserably
taunted
only
by
the
echoes
of
her
own
choking
voice
this
devil
land
took
on
a
vindictive
personality
it
was
a
hideous
colossus
stooping
over
her
inspired
with
but
one
cruel
desire
to
crush
her
soft
white
body
to
stamp
out
her
life
to
annihilate
her
and
gloat
over
her
shrieking
despair
she
felt
like
some
hapless
little
princess
in
a
who
had
wandered
into
a
monstrous
land
of
black
sorcery
by
four
when
it
seemed
to
gloria
that
she
had
reached
and
was
passing
the
limits
of
her
endurance
came
two
momentous
occurrences
king
riding
ahead
as
usual
was
not
quite
so
far
in
advance
and
did
not
have
his
back
turned
square
upon
her
for
the
first
time
he
had
briefly
mistaken
the
trail
they
were
on
the
steep
flank
of
the
mountain
he
turned
and
rode
back
in
her
general
direction
but
some
hundred
yards
lower
on
the
slope
the
trail
down
here
he
announced
shortly
he
did
not
lift
his
eyes
to
her
face
did
not
note
the
droop
of
the
weary
body
his
look
was
all
for
her
horse
and
a
new
and
unreasonable
spurt
of
anger
was
in
his
heart
through
her
unbounded
ignorance
she
had
needlessly
fatigued
her
mount
having
no
knowledge
of
the
ways
one
employs
to
save
his
horse
gloria
understood
dully
that
she
was
too
far
up
and
must
ride
down
to
his
level
she
was
beyond
complaining
or
asking
questions
with
a
sudden
jerk
upon
the
reins
she
brought
blackie
about
king
cursed
under
his
breath
that
too
steep
he
called
to
her
want
to
kill
your
horse
blackie
tried
to
swerve
and
sidle
down
gloria
lifted
her
whip
and
struck
him
blackie
snorted
and
obeyed
her
command
some
loose
dirt
gave
way
underfoot
the
tired
beast
stumbled
a
dead
limb
caught
at
his
legs
tripping
him
and
blackie
lurched
downward
and
fell
through
the
grace
of
fortune
gloria
rolled
clear
and
unhurt
blackie
got
up
tottering
with
one
quivering
lifted
king
face
went
black
with
rage
but
this
time
it
was
wordless
rage
he
dismounted
and
made
his
way
up
to
the
lamed
horse
gloria
from
where
she
lay
thought
at
first
that
of
course
he
was
coming
to
her
but
he
kept
his
back
to
her
as
he
lifted
the
horse
and
felt
tenderly
at
the
wrenched
muscle
gloria
without
stirring
and
without
experiencing
any
poignant
emotion
watched
him
listlessly
then
shut
her
eyes
her
most
clear
sensation
was
one
of
relief
they
would
no
doubt
make
camp
here
a
cold
drop
of
rain
splashed
on
her
cheek
she
opened
her
eyes
king
was
removing
blackie
saddle
gloria
closed
her
eyes
again
and
sighed
a
sort
of
dreary
thankfulness
blossomed
feebly
in
her
heart
that
the
torturous
day
was
over
king
would
make
some
sort
of
a
shelter
she
would
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
and
crawl
into
her
blankets
and
go
to
sleep
come
on
called
a
voice
as
though
from
some
great
distance
we
got
to
hurry
as
fast
as
god
will
let
us
blackie
was
standing
where
king
had
led
him
his
saddle
and
bridle
swung
up
into
a
tree
his
foot
still
lifted
his
nostrils
close
to
the
long
grass
but
untempted
gloria
pack
and
the
rifle
were
across
king
back
as
she
sat
up
and
stared
at
him
she
read
his
intentions
he
was
going
on
on
foot
expecting
her
to
take
his
horse
i
ca
she
said
miserably
he
looked
up
into
the
sky
and
not
at
her
you
can
do
what
you
please
he
retorted
curtly
i
am
going
on
she
rose
and
went
stumbling
down
the
slope
she
swayed
as
she
tried
to
mount
but
he
did
not
offer
his
hand
when
she
was
in
the
saddle
he
strode
on
ahead
blackie
looked
after
them
wistfully
the
leg
not
broken
king
told
her
gruffly
just
a
bad
sprain
not
your
fault
it
is
worse
though
he
take
care
of
himself
god
knows
he
got
as
good
a
chance
as
we
have
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
quickly
he
merely
swung
up
his
arm
toward
the
sky
by
way
of
answer
and
went
on
the
second
big
hit
gloria
cheek
it
was
chill
its
dullness
seemed
to
drive
straight
to
her
heart
the
storm
caught
them
as
it
has
caught
so
many
a
wayfarer
before
and
since
the
wintry
season
was
not
due
for
a
full
four
weeks
but
the
winter
had
thrust
sign
and
season
aside
and
made
his
regal
entry
after
his
own
ancient
fashion
there
came
a
crash
of
reverberating
thunder
a
scurry
in
the
thickening
mass
of
black
clouds
a
drenching
downpour
of
rain
for
twenty
minutes
they
crouched
in
what
scant
shelter
was
afforded
them
by
a
squat
cedar
then
the
wind
went
ripping
off
through
the
exacting
its
toll
of
flying
twigs
and
leaving
in
its
wake
a
brief
hushed
calm
through
the
still
air
fell
scattering
flakes
of
snow
big
and
unbroken
and
feathery
king
eyes
were
filled
with
concern
his
face
was
ominous
like
the
face
of
the
world
about
him
again
gloria
tired
body
was
assured
of
rest
again
king
said
expressionlessly
come
on
this
time
he
helped
her
into
the
saddle
being
in
haste
and
of
no
mind
to
wait
for
trifles
he
hurried
on
ahead
she
followed
on
buck
listlessly
clinging
to
the
saddle
her
eyes
often
shut
for
an
hour
it
snowed
though
there
was
no
sun
it
was
not
dark
save
in
the
deeper
cañons
nor
was
it
as
cold
as
gloria
had
thought
it
must
be
or
else
she
was
too
tired
to
feel
the
pinch
of
the
sharp
air
but
presently
the
flakes
grew
fewer
and
then
ceased
utterly
those
that
lay
on
the
ground
or
clung
to
branches
melted
swiftly
and
with
their
departure
the
last
light
of
the
day
was
gone
now
king
led
the
horse
and
gloria
rode
through
a
gathering
darkness
she
wanted
to
ask
why
they
did
not
stop
why
they
did
not
turn
back
but
lacked
the
spirit
now
and
then
she
half
dozed
at
last
it
was
pitch
dark
and
the
rain
was
beginning
again
king
had
stopped
and
was
helping
her
down
she
was
numb
now
in
body
her
brain
was
numb
the
rain
hardened
into
a
rattle
of
hail
thereafter
the
air
softened
and
filled
with
swirling
snow
gloria
could
not
see
if
they
were
in
an
open
valley
or
shut
in
by
canon
walls
or
upon
the
slope
of
a
mountain
nor
did
she
greatly
care
she
waited
until
king
prepared
some
kind
of
a
shelter
and
then
went
wordlessly
to
it
she
felt
under
her
aching
body
and
was
in
pure
animal
fashion
conscious
of
blanket
and
canvas
over
her
and
of
a
grateful
warmth
through
a
tangle
of
bushes
she
saw
the
flicker
of
a
small
fire
she
smelled
coffee
she
drank
half
of
the
hot
cup
which
he
brought
to
her
then
she
let
go
her
grip
upon
a
wretched
world
and
passed
like
a
child
into
a
heavy
sleep
by
his
fire
of
little
cheer
mark
king
sat
with
his
canvas
drawn
over
his
slumping
shoulders
his
head
down
his
heart
as
black
as
the
night
his
soul
possessed
by
ravaging
blue
demons
at
the
end
of
a
fool
day
came
a
fool
night
he
should
have
paid
heed
to
the
first
threat
of
a
thin
film
across
the
sky
he
should
have
turned
back
with
gloria
the
first
thing
this
morning
he
should
have
done
anything
in
the
world
save
exactly
what
he
had
done
he
should
not
have
married
her
he
should
not
have
brought
her
with
him
it
was
even
sheer
idiocy
to
come
after
this
blind
fashion
into
the
mountains
in
the
late
fall
though
the
season
was
early
the
hour
was
ominous
the
storm
might
pass
before
dawn
there
remained
the
equal
likelihood
that
it
would
not
were
he
alone
or
had
he
a
man
or
yes
by
heaven
a
real
woman
with
him
things
would
not
be
so
bad
the
wind
jeered
at
him
through
the
trees
the
storm
drenched
his
fire
he
cursed
back
at
both
one
thing
he
thought
when
his
pipe
brought
him
a
solitary
instant
of
peace
i
wo
be
worried
with
gratton
and
brodie
and
his
crowd
if
they
ever
started
they
would
have
sense
enough
to
turn
back
long
ago
after
the
cold
wet
night
came
a
sodden
morning
king
stood
up
and
looked
about
him
curiously
his
first
thought
was
to
make
sure
that
they
had
really
camped
upon
the
edge
of
that
particular
upland
valley
which
he
had
striven
for
and
a
glint
of
satisfaction
came
into
his
eyes
it
is
something
to
have
followed
such
a
trail
aright
upon
such
a
night
down
yonder
a
crooked
black
line
in
a
white
field
was
the
stream
which
many
miles
further
on
flowed
into
the
american
rising
abrupt
beyond
it
were
the
broken
precipitous
cliffs
of
granite
such
as
beetle
above
the
mountain
tributaries
of
the
american
the
rocks
like
the
river
were
black
and
looked
far
colder
than
the
white
world
which
extended
in
all
directions
if
in
truth
there
existed
heaps
of
raw
red
gold
somewhere
in
a
cave
in
these
mountains
and
there
had
been
any
exactness
in
the
description
in
gus
ingle
bible
then
the
spot
was
not
more
than
three
or
four
miles
away
that
was
one
consideration
it
was
still
snowing
here
was
a
second
consideration
king
turned
moody
eyes
to
gloria
shelter
in
the
lee
of
a
little
bit
of
cliff
there
lay
the
third
he
prepared
breakfast
without
delay
but
without
enthusiasm
he
felt
a
tired
man
with
shackled
limbs
dragging
a
dead
weight
when
he
went
to
wake
gloria
he
first
stood
over
her
looking
queerly
down
upon
her
sleep
she
showed
less
trace
of
the
hard
day
and
wild
night
than
he
had
expected
to
see
his
preparations
for
her
comfort
instinctive
and
thorough
had
been
made
with
the
cunning
skill
of
a
man
familiar
with
situations
like
the
present
she
had
rested
she
lay
curled
up
snug
and
warm
under
the
covers
upon
which
a
thin
layer
of
fluffy
snow
had
gathered
her
face
was
against
a
curved
arm
and
the
sweetness
of
it
in
its
tranquil
repose
was
a
bitter
sweet
to
him
her
lashes
against
her
cheek
stirred
and
flew
apart
under
his
steady
gaze
he
looked
into
gloria
eyes
sweet
and
soft
heavy
with
sleep
time
to
be
up
he
said
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
back
in
haste
to
his
fire
gloria
awake
was
ravenously
hungry
she
came
sooner
than
he
had
expected
setting
the
wild
disarray
of
her
hair
in
some
hurried
order
her
eyes
were
quick
and
curious
as
she
looked
up
at
him
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
behind
his
back
and
extended
her
hands
to
the
small
blaze
are
we
going
back
she
asked
colourlessly
no
he
returned
as
indifferently
it
about
four
miles
to
the
caves
we
be
there
in
a
couple
of
hours
then
we
see
what
we
see
gloria
sent
a
long
searching
and
look
across
the
broken
country
yonder
then
she
realized
dismally
lay
their
destination
bleak
black
rocky
heights
at
so
great
an
altitude
and
in
a
region
so
barren
that
but
few
trees
grew
and
the
brutal
face
of
the
world
was
unmasked
she
saw
bare
peaks
steep
slopes
a
tremendous
gorge
like
an
ugly
gash
on
the
far
side
of
the
gorge
sheer
cliffs
toward
them
king
looked
was
it
there
that
gus
ingle
caves
awaited
them
was
that
journey
end
she
shivered
and
drew
closer
to
the
fire
closer
to
her
companion
shrinking
from
the
menace
of
the
mountains
is
it
going
to
keep
on
snowing
she
asked
this
time
he
shrugged
that
was
his
only
answer
she
stared
at
him
a
slow
flush
came
into
her
cheeks
her
eyes
hardened
oh
very
well
she
said
coldly
that
was
the
whole
of
their
conversation
save
for
one
curt
remark
and
an
impudent
laugh
in
answer
at
the
end
of
the
scanty
meal
gloria
tossed
a
piece
of
bacon
into
the
fire
king
looked
at
her
sternly
and
said
young
lady
we
may
be
up
against
the
real
thing
right
now
nobody
but
a
fool
will
do
a
trick
like
that
the
laugh
was
gloria
once
on
their
way
they
climbed
almost
steadily
the
air
grew
rarer
and
colder
the
snowflakes
became
smaller
at
last
a
fine
sifting
like
sand
particles
that
cut
at
hands
and
face
viciously
no
longer
were
there
groves
to
shelter
them
on
all
sides
bare
hostile
rocks
and
only
occasionally
a
sparse
growth
of
sprawling
dwarf
pine
and
cedar
over
which
king
strode
as
over
so
much
low
tangled
brush
then
came
a
long
ridge
a
spine
from
which
the
world
dropped
almost
sheer
on
both
sides
with
the
wind
raging
so
that
it
seemed
buck
must
be
blown
off
his
feet
or
the
girl
torn
from
the
saddle
and
borne
far
out
like
a
thistledown
with
frightened
eyes
which
she
strove
vainly
to
keep
closed
she
saw
long
broken
slopes
occasionally
when
the
air
cleared
a
frothing
torrent
and
once
at
the
end
of
a
couple
of
hours
far
down
in
a
distant
level
land
a
growth
of
giant
timber
she
thought
that
king
was
making
his
way
down
there
but
his
purpose
soon
became
plain
even
to
her
he
was
keeping
high
on
the
ridges
going
about
the
head
of
the
ravine
which
lower
down
cut
like
a
knife
across
the
timbered
tract
headed
for
what
he
took
to
be
gus
ingle
cave
a
mile
away
she
saw
it
a
great
ragged
black
hole
in
a
high
mass
of
rock
close
to
the
crest
of
the
next
ridge
she
was
wrapped
warmly
and
yet
here
the
icy
breath
of
the
wind
pierced
the
fabric
of
her
wrappings
and
hurt
her
to
the
bone
she
watched
king
wonderingly
as
he
hastened
on
did
the
man
have
no
sense
of
bodily
discomfort
certainly
he
gave
no
sign
he
was
like
an
animal
she
found
room
for
a
flash
of
scorn
in
the
thought
for
so
she
was
pleased
to
consider
him
lower
in
the
scale
than
herself
at
another
time
she
might
have
seen
the
world
about
her
clothed
in
grandeur
now
its
sublimity
was
lost
i
upon
her
it
was
a
ravening
beast
an
ugly
thing
big
and
brutal
and
like
king
oh
how
she
hated
it
and
him
when
at
last
he
waited
for
her
and
told
her
to
get
down
she
had
the
suspicion
that
he
had
gone
mad
certainly
here
was
no
spot
to
tarry
it
was
on
her
lips
to
demur
but
she
looked
at
his
face
and
slipped
stiffly
from
the
saddle
they
were
high
up
on
the
ridge
gloria
on
foot
beside
him
clutched
at
the
branch
of
one
of
the
sprawling
cliff
growths
in
sudden
panic
that
she
was
being
swept
from
her
feet
just
below
them
was
the
deepening
cleft
in
the
which
further
down
widened
and
descended
into
the
gorge
through
it
shot
a
mad
frothy
stream
a
hundred
yards
further
on
high
up
in
the
cliffs
was
the
yawning
hole
in
the
rocks
king
holding
buck
bridle
looked
about
him
and
at
the
sky
gloria
read
in
his
manner
a
hint
of
uncertainty
hoping
to
influence
his
decision
she
said
quickly
had
we
better
turn
back
now
he
looked
at
her
steadily
before
answering
in
what
he
replied
in
that
impersonal
way
which
maddened
her
have
you
so
altered
as
to
be
worth
a
man
broken
promise
and
then
she
knew
that
no
thought
of
going
back
had
had
any
part
in
his
brief
indecision
he
was
going
forward
would
go
forward
in
anything
he
undertook
that
was
a
part
of
his
he
was
merely
seeking
the
best
place
to
unpack
and
a
convenient
spot
to
tether
buck
they
were
going
to
make
camp
either
right
here
or
nearer
the
cave
perhaps
in
it
she
looked
at
the
uninviting
hole
and
shivered
she
would
know
his
decision
when
king
saw
fit
to
enlighten
her
now
he
merely
dumped
at
her
feet
the
roll
from
the
horse
back
setting
his
rifle
down
against
it
then
he
led
buck
away
zigzagging
tediously
at
last
passing
from
sight
beyond
an
out
jutting
monster
crag
gloria
crouched
seeking
to
shield
herself
from
the
whiplashes
of
the
wind
she
listened
to
it
as
it
shrieked
about
the
slabs
and
boulders
of
granite
the
sound
was
indescribably
eerie
filled
with
unrest
eloquent
of
the
brutal
contempt
of
the
eternal
for
the
feeble
and
transient
the
universe
grew
utterly
lonely
the
wind
was
a
whining
thing
cutting
through
the
silence
and
king
was
so
long
in
coming
back
the
terrifying
thought
electrified
her
what
if
he
had
deserted
her
what
if
he
had
no
intention
of
coming
back
she
should
have
known
better
perhaps
deep
down
within
her
she
did
know
better
but
the
suspicion
brought
its
wild
flutter
she
sprang
up
and
grew
rigid
in
tense
fright
she
felt
a
strange
glad
rush
of
joy
as
she
saw
his
hat
bobbing
up
and
toward
her
along
the
mountain
flank
when
he
rejoined
her
she
was
staring
off
at
nothingness
her
back
to
him
he
lashed
the
two
canvas
rolls
together
swung
them
up
to
his
shoulders
took
and
rifle
in
his
free
hand
and
nodded
toward
the
small
pack
of
provisions
which
had
been
left
over
from
lunch
better
bring
those
he
advised
briefly
there
no
telling
what
may
be
in
the
cards
he
went
on
along
the
of
the
ridge
down
into
a
little
depression
up
beyond
she
hesitated
saw
that
he
had
not
looked
bit
her
lip
angrily
and
snatched
up
the
parcel
then
she
followed
him
stooping
against
the
wind
when
she
came
up
with
him
he
had
thrown
down
his
pack
at
the
very
edge
of
the
gorge
she
came
to
his
side
leaned
forward
and
looked
down
far
below
plunged
the
wildest
torrent
she
had
ever
seen
it
hurled
itself
in
mad
haste
between
boulders
it
shot
down
over
dizzy
falls
it
made
for
itself
a
white
mantle
of
frothing
waters
it
looked
as
black
as
ebony
in
sections
of
smoother
channel
and
as
cold
as
death
it
spun
in
whirlpools
it
filled
the
air
with
its
din
and
king
meant
to
go
down
to
it
to
cross
it
to
climb
the
dizzy
cliff
upon
the
further
side
she
knew
from
his
look
without
asking
for
just
across
the
chasm
from
them
in
the
highest
of
the
cliffs
was
the
yawning
place
of
horrors
if
one
slipped
on
those
bare
rocks
clambering
down
or
climbing
on
the
further
side
she
sat
down
suddenly
now
when
her
lip
was
caught
between
her
teeth
it
was
to
fight
back
the
tears
the
world
was
so
cold
and
stern
and
brutal
this
man
was
so
much
like
the
environment
she
was
so
woefully
desperately
on
this
lofty
crest
of
a
land
she
felt
the
insignificance
of
a
fly
clinging
to
the
brow
of
an
abyss
king
went
about
his
task
methodically
gloria
watched
him
rather
than
look
across
the
rocky
gorges
slowly
and
with
difficulty
he
made
his
way
down
the
steep
wall
of
rocks
dragging
and
pulling
the
roll
of
bedding
and
provisions
after
him
it
required
perhaps
twenty
minutes
for
him
to
get
to
the
bottom
she
wondered
where
he
would
attempt
a
crossing
the
water
looked
so
black
in
the
pools
so
violent
over
the
rapids
he
went
there
lay
an
old
cedar
log
so
that
it
spanned
the
current
its
sturdy
old
trunk
ten
feet
above
the
water
for
a
moment
king
disappeared
under
an
ledge
then
she
saw
him
again
the
pack
on
his
shoulders
he
had
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
the
log
he
was
crossing
where
he
went
now
she
must
follow
fascinated
she
watched
him
once
she
thought
he
was
going
to
fall
but
unerringly
he
trod
the
rude
bridge
underfoot
gained
the
other
side
without
mishap
tossed
down
his
bundle
and
lowered
himself
from
the
log
after
it
gloria
marvelled
at
him
she
could
see
his
face
and
it
was
impassive
could
he
not
hear
the
hostile
voices
of
the
raging
waters
could
he
not
feel
the
ominous
threat
of
the
bleak
day
and
the
monster
cliffs
was
he
a
man
without
imagination
as
he
seemed
to
be
without
fear
on
he
went
again
clinging
to
the
steep
pitch
of
the
gorge
until
he
was
almost
under
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
he
put
back
his
head
and
looked
up
it
was
a
hundred
feet
above
him
and
the
cliffs
from
where
gloria
sat
numb
with
cold
and
dread
looked
unsurmountable
yet
he
was
going
up
them
and
where
he
goes
you
will
follow
it
was
as
though
the
wild
waters
below
were
chanting
it
into
her
ears
and
thereafter
filling
the
gorge
with
the
mockery
of
derisive
laughter
slowly
tediously
but
with
never
a
sign
of
hesitation
king
made
his
way
up
the
cliff
he
had
been
here
before
he
knew
and
remembered
every
foothold
and
handhold
nor
was
the
task
the
impossible
one
it
looked
from
a
distance
there
were
cracks
and
crevices
there
were
seams
of
a
harder
material
which
better
withstanding
the
attacks
of
time
were
thrust
out
beyond
the
general
level
on
them
a
man
might
stand
there
were
spots
of
softer
material
scooped
out
into
pockets
by
wind
and
water
there
were
flinty
splinters
there
were
places
where
the
wall
looking
from
across
the
cañon
to
be
sheer
and
perpendicular
sloped
more
gently
and
a
man
might
crawl
up
them
king
had
drawn
up
after
him
stage
after
stage
the
roll
of
bedding
using
blackie
to
haul
it
up
and
to
moor
it
briefly
gloria
saw
it
swing
at
times
like
a
huge
misshapen
pendulum
watched
it
crawl
up
after
him
she
saw
the
wind
snatch
at
it
and
set
it
scraping
back
and
forth
when
he
let
it
dangle
at
rope
end
she
saw
king
coat
flap
in
the
wind
once
she
cried
out
aloud
thinking
a
second
time
that
king
was
falling
if
he
fell
from
that
height
if
he
were
killed
what
then
would
be
the
fate
of
gloria
gaynor
but
at
length
he
came
safely
to
the
cave
mouth
he
stood
upright
and
looked
about
him
then
he
drew
up
to
his
feet
the
dangling
roll
with
it
in
his
arms
he
was
gone
into
that
yawning
hole
she
waited
breathlessly
for
his
return
she
saw
him
come
again
into
the
light
he
had
the
rope
in
his
hand
was
coiling
it
he
began
to
come
down
he
was
returning
for
her
she
did
not
stir
while
he
made
the
slow
descent
nor
while
he
recrossed
on
the
log
and
climbed
the
steep
bank
to
her
i
am
going
to
spend
the
day
up
there
he
told
her
in
his
studied
aloof
manner
i
know
soon
enough
now
what
truth
there
is
in
the
story
of
gus
ingle
gold
there
room
in
the
cave
to
sleep
and
there
shelter
of
a
sort
morning
if
i
find
nothing
i
start
back
with
you
if
you
care
to
come
up
now
i
help
you
what
else
is
there
to
do
cried
gloria
with
the
first
flash
of
passion
what
else
do
you
leave
me
he
slipped
a
loop
of
the
rope
about
her
waist
taking
slow
pains
not
to
touch
her
with
his
hands
and
turned
downward
again
she
followed
filled
with
sudden
fear
when
they
had
climbed
down
ten
feet
obeying
him
hastily
when
he
commanded
her
to
stand
still
or
to
move
on
feeling
her
fear
grow
mightily
as
they
progressed
the
wind
strengthening
abruptly
tore
at
her
in
angry
gusts
she
was
panting
and
shaking
visibly
when
finally
she
reached
the
log
spanning
the
stream
he
was
up
before
her
offering
her
his
hand
how
she
hated
to
touch
it
how
she
feared
to
follow
him
but
her
hand
went
into
his
her
steps
followed
his
and
without
hesitation
for
there
was
nothing
left
now
to
choice
she
looked
down
and
saw
the
water
raging
below
it
was
like
a
monster
leaping
at
her
snatching
at
her
she
wanted
to
look
away
and
could
not
like
one
moving
through
the
fearsome
steps
of
a
nightmare
she
went
on
clinging
to
king
hand
his
hand
tight
upon
hers
cold
hands
which
met
because
they
must
at
last
the
torrent
was
behind
her
she
came
down
into
arms
from
the
log
she
was
faint
and
would
have
sat
down
but
he
urged
her
on
it
was
another
nightmare
climbing
up
the
cliffs
to
the
cave
he
went
ahead
he
stopped
and
braced
himself
he
tautened
the
rope
about
her
waist
and
said
come
on
slow
and
careful
does
it
she
clutched
with
her
cold
sore
fingers
at
the
rocks
felt
the
rope
tighten
and
went
up
and
up
the
wind
as
though
in
a
fury
at
losing
its
quarry
shrieked
in
her
ears
and
in
mighty
gusts
strove
to
drag
her
hands
from
the
rocks
and
to
set
her
swinging
as
it
had
swung
the
roll
of
bedding
she
climbed
on
king
ordered
and
she
obeyed
she
waited
for
him
to
go
up
further
ahead
for
him
to
call
to
her
and
draw
in
on
the
rope
stage
by
stage
weary
stages
fraught
with
terror
she
toiled
up
and
up
and
up
and
so
at
last
when
it
seemed
to
her
that
no
strength
remained
in
her
she
came
to
king
side
at
the
gloomy
entrance
of
gus
ingle
cave
the
formless
black
void
before
her
which
under
other
circumstances
would
have
repelled
now
invited
it
offered
shelter
and
rest
and
protection
she
crept
by
king
with
never
a
backward
glance
and
threw
herself
face
down
on
the
uneven
floor
a
long
time
king
stood
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
looking
forth
upon
the
newly
whitened
world
the
look
of
the
thickening
sky
the
wintry
sting
of
the
rushing
air
the
businesslike
way
in
which
the
snow
swirled
and
fell
created
a
condition
upon
which
he
had
not
counted
and
for
which
he
had
no
relish
this
was
more
like
a
blizzard
than
any
storm
had
any
business
being
so
early
in
the
season
for
many
hours
already
the
snow
had
been
falling
piling
up
in
the
mountain
passes
if
it
kept
on
at
this
rate
through
another
day
and
night
well
he
and
gloria
had
best
be
getting
out
without
any
loitering
he
looked
at
his
watch
not
yet
eleven
need
for
haste
the
day
would
be
short
before
darkness
shut
down
he
had
half
a
dozen
hours
hours
for
methodical
search
here
was
one
of
gus
ingle
caves
another
he
knew
was
directly
below
and
at
the
base
of
the
cliffs
the
third
should
be
near
it
was
the
third
that
he
was
chiefly
interested
in
he
recalled
the
words
in
the
old
bible
we
come
to
the
first
caive
and
then
we
come
to
caive
number
three
and
two
there
lay
significance
in
the
order
of
ingle
numerals
first
three
and
two
two
of
the
caves
were
for
any
one
to
see
before
now
king
had
been
in
both
of
them
hence
it
must
be
that
gus
ingle
treasure
lay
in
the
third
that
one
king
must
locate
and
without
too
much
delay
he
looked
down
at
gloria
she
lay
motionless
just
as
she
had
thrown
herself
down
taking
his
rope
with
him
king
made
what
haste
he
could
going
down
the
cliffs
the
sides
of
the
ravine
were
littered
with
dead
wood
drift
and
limbs
that
had
broken
off
the
few
battered
trees
above
he
gathered
as
heavy
a
load
of
dry
branches
as
he
could
handle
bound
them
about
with
his
rope
and
fighting
his
way
all
the
way
up
clambered
again
to
the
upper
cave
gloria
had
not
stirred
he
moved
about
her
went
a
dozen
paces
deeper
into
the
great
cavern
and
threw
down
his
wood
breaking
branches
into
short
lengths
he
quickly
got
a
fire
going
the
flames
spurted
up
eagerly
bright
and
cheery
and
threw
dancing
light
among
the
wavering
shadows
he
brought
the
closer
and
opened
it
into
a
bed
then
he
called
to
gloria
you
better
lie
here
by
the
fire
he
told
her
you
apt
to
catch
cold
there
she
was
sitting
up
watching
him
now
she
rose
listlessly
and
came
forward
dropping
down
into
a
sitting
position
upon
the
blankets
her
chilled
hands
out
toward
the
blaze
i
do
like
the
look
of
this
storm
he
told
her
it
is
up
to
us
to
hurry
i
am
going
to
look
around
now
i
think
you
had
better
rest
all
you
can
so
as
to
be
ready
to
make
a
start
back
as
soon
as
i
find
out
whether
we
are
on
a
chase
or
not
you
mean
we
may
start
back
i
do
know
what
i
am
going
to
find
of
course
whether
i
am
going
to
find
anything
but
if
we
can
get
only
a
couple
of
hours
on
our
way
it
just
that
much
gained
you
are
going
to
leave
me
here
i
wo
be
far
with
that
he
set
fire
to
a
dry
pine
faggot
the
best
torch
available
and
left
her
going
deeper
into
the
cave
she
watched
him
marvelling
at
the
size
of
the
cavern
he
went
on
a
score
of
paces
he
seemed
to
be
ascending
a
steepening
slant
floor
and
then
to
have
gone
over
a
sort
of
ridge
and
to
be
descending
again
but
still
going
further
from
her
presently
she
knew
that
the
tunnel
had
turned
sharply
to
the
right
she
could
hear
the
thud
of
his
boots
and
for
a
little
while
could
see
the
flare
of
his
torch
against
a
wall
of
rock
he
himself
had
passed
out
of
her
sight
but
she
knew
that
he
had
not
gone
a
great
deal
further
for
he
was
not
so
far
away
that
she
could
not
hear
him
he
was
going
back
and
forth
at
irregular
intervals
she
saw
a
dim
ghostly
light
playing
upon
the
dark
cavern
walls
and
despite
the
weary
ache
of
a
body
she
began
to
be
interested
in
his
search
if
there
were
in
truth
such
gold
here
somewhere
as
he
and
her
father
with
him
had
dreamed
of
gold
for
which
seven
men
had
died
sixty
years
ago
for
which
old
loony
honeycutt
had
hungered
all
these
years
for
which
brodie
and
his
following
and
even
a
city
man
like
gratton
were
like
so
many
ravening
wolves
on
the
trail
gold
in
quantity
to
make
even
toughened
old
delirious
with
the
dreams
of
it
why
then
that
gold
was
half
mark
king
and
half
ben
gaynor
and
it
might
be
that
now
at
this
very
instant
mark
king
was
finding
it
was
standing
over
it
staring
down
at
it
by
the
ghostly
flare
of
a
smoking
torch
she
sat
tense
and
still
listening
trying
to
probe
with
tired
but
suddenly
bright
eyes
through
the
dark
she
started
realizing
that
no
longer
could
she
hear
king
searching
back
and
forth
it
was
very
silent
about
her
only
the
crackle
of
the
flames
making
a
sound
to
be
heard
against
the
rush
of
air
outside
it
seemed
to
her
that
king
had
been
gone
a
long
time
she
rose
to
her
feet
tempted
to
follow
him
she
was
curious
to
know
what
he
was
doing
why
he
was
so
silent
where
he
had
gone
but
in
the
end
pride
restrained
her
and
she
sat
down
again
to
wait
in
an
attitude
of
indifference
but
the
minutes
dragged
on
and
never
a
sound
came
back
from
the
far
dark
depths
of
the
cavern
fifteen
minutes
half
an
hour
she
grew
restless
and
walked
up
and
down
she
went
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
stood
looking
out
into
the
swirling
she
returned
to
the
fire
throwing
on
more
wood
she
felt
sure
that
an
hour
had
passed
two
hours
she
began
to
grow
alarmed
always
that
dread
thought
was
ready
to
spring
out
upon
her
if
something
had
happened
to
him
she
went
a
little
way
in
the
direction
he
had
taken
stood
peering
into
the
dark
listening
breathless
and
rigid
never
a
sound
she
went
back
to
the
front
of
the
cave
looking
down
staring
out
into
the
grey
sky
across
the
ridge
gloria
trembling
with
a
new
excitement
was
down
on
her
knees
before
the
pack
when
king
returned
she
sprang
up
to
face
him
and
each
with
the
other
emotions
and
experiences
of
the
past
two
or
three
hours
unknown
to
him
marvelled
at
what
was
to
be
read
in
the
other
face
gloria
was
excited
king
excitement
was
no
less
where
she
had
at
least
the
clue
to
his
altered
expression
he
had
none
to
hers
it
here
he
burst
out
and
i
found
it
tons
and
tons
of
it
such
knobs
and
nuggets
of
pure
gold
as
never
man
laid
eyes
on
we
have
here
the
magic
lamp
to
rub
a
castle
in
spain
and
an
yacht
and
the
newest
thing
in
and
a
trip
around
the
world
and
a
presentation
to
royalty
a
fragment
of
heaven
and
a
very
large
slice
of
hell
ambition
fulfilled
and
love
consumed
and
hate
born
we
have
old
ben
made
whole
and
full
of
power
again
and
here
we
have
all
that
is
left
of
gus
ingle
and
his
friends
except
for
a
pile
of
bones
back
yonder
she
saw
that
in
each
hand
he
carried
what
looked
like
a
big
rough
stone
she
saw
from
the
way
he
carried
them
that
they
were
heavy
the
fires
leaped
higher
brighter
in
her
eyes
now
she
saw
the
way
to
make
mark
king
pay
for
all
of
his
brutality
to
her
to
pay
to
the
uttermost
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
she
said
as
stiffly
as
she
knew
the
way
i
care
to
hear
nothing
you
have
to
say
i
have
tolerated
all
that
i
mean
to
tolerate
from
you
her
bearing
no
less
than
her
words
astonished
him
for
the
first
time
he
saw
what
it
was
that
she
held
in
her
hands
she
had
been
gathering
up
her
own
little
personal
effects
a
tiny
parcel
of
silken
things
comb
and
brush
trifling
feminine
odds
and
ends
he
stared
at
her
wonderingly
i
do
understand
gloria
treated
him
to
cool
laughter
you
will
in
a
minute
i
am
going
going
you
in
god
name
deep
silence
answered
him
he
frowned
at
her
in
puzzled
fashion
a
moment
then
suspecting
the
truth
since
his
racing
mind
could
hit
on
no
other
possible
explanation
of
her
manner
he
dropped
to
the
fireside
the
things
in
his
hands
and
went
swiftly
to
the
cave
mouth
he
looked
out
into
the
storm
his
eyes
questing
in
all
directions
nothing
only
the
thickening
storm
the
ridges
dim
beyond
the
swirl
of
snow
then
he
saw
for
a
long
time
he
stood
studying
it
seeking
to
make
sure
what
he
saw
was
beaten
down
by
the
falling
snow
dissipated
by
the
wind
gone
entirely
over
and
again
only
to
rise
like
a
shapeless
ghost
of
disaster
it
was
a
column
of
smoke
some
one
had
encamped
no
great
distance
away
on
the
same
stream
hidden
only
by
the
windings
of
the
gorge
some
one
why
then
gratton
and
brodie
and
their
crowd
after
all
he
glowered
angrily
toward
the
faint
smudge
of
smoke
then
he
swung
about
and
came
back
to
gloria
side
you
saw
that
smoke
he
demanded
you
plan
on
going
to
them
yes
cried
gloria
she
sprang
up
and
confronted
him
angrily
yes
to
both
questions
you
know
who
they
are
then
no
but
that
does
matter
which
means
as
plain
as
print
he
said
thoughtfully
that
you
would
go
to
any
man
to
be
rid
of
me
he
laughed
unpleasantly
and
anger
flared
the
higher
do
you
know
he
said
presently
that
they
are
probably
gratton
and
swen
brodie
and
their
outfit
what
of
it
asked
gloria
erect
and
defiant
you
know
that
gratton
has
set
out
to
ruin
your
father
that
he
a
scoundrel
that
brodie
is
worse
that
neither
is
hardly
the
sort
for
a
girl
to
trust
herself
to
in
a
place
like
this
i
am
not
given
much
choice
gloria
informed
him
with
high
insolence
that
a
fact
he
conceded
with
a
grunt
he
give
a
thousand
dollars
right
now
to
be
well
rid
of
her
yes
and
have
gratton
and
brodie
and
the
rest
of
them
come
on
looking
for
any
sort
of
a
row
that
suited
their
ilk
he
told
himself
that
with
savage
emphasis
but
he
asked
could
he
let
her
go
before
i
go
said
gloria
when
she
thought
that
he
had
nothing
further
to
add
i
want
to
say
just
one
thing
father
has
always
considered
you
his
best
friend
i
shall
lose
no
time
in
telling
him
what
you
really
are
gloria
remark
coming
just
when
it
did
in
king
perplexity
settled
his
decision
firmly
on
him
the
girl
was
a
vicious
little
fool
so
he
was
determined
to
think
of
her
unequivocally
but
she
was
after
all
ben
gaynor
daughter
and
furthermore
the
apple
of
ben
eye
she
was
in
king
keeping
he
had
been
eminently
to
blame
for
bringing
her
here
his
was
the
responsibility
gratton
eye
was
the
sort
that
soils
a
woman
you
are
going
he
said
suddenly
turning
upon
her
i
allow
you
to
put
yourself
in
gratton
or
brodie
dirty
hands
a
quick
light
was
in
her
eyes
a
quick
spurt
of
satisfaction
in
her
heart
in
king
decision
she
read
the
assurance
that
he
was
still
madly
in
love
with
her
that
now
his
jealousy
stirred
him
she
lifted
her
chin
and
with
her
little
bundle
under
her
arm
came
forward
walking
confidently
stand
aside
please
she
commanded
i
am
going
i
tell
you
again
sensing
the
familiarity
of
the
battlefield
she
felt
an
almost
serene
confidence
believing
herself
easily
mistress
of
the
situation
so
much
must
have
been
plain
to
king
from
that
stand
aside
please
which
miss
gloria
gaynor
of
last
week
might
have
addressed
to
a
porter
were
it
not
that
just
now
king
thought
was
not
bended
to
trifles
when
she
came
to
his
side
and
he
did
not
stir
she
sought
to
brush
by
him
there
was
no
hesitation
in
the
way
in
which
he
put
out
his
hand
and
held
her
back
there
can
be
only
one
captain
to
an
expedition
in
adventure
he
told
her
seriously
i
have
been
elected
to
the
job
you
pardon
me
if
i
put
matters
into
words
until
we
are
well
out
of
this
if
we
are
ever
out
at
all
you
will
have
to
do
what
i
tell
you
you
are
not
going
to
desert
ship
she
stared
at
him
speechlessly
then
by
what
right
do
issue
orders
to
she
cried
let
us
say
he
returned
in
the
coin
of
her
own
harshness
by
the
old
right
of
a
husband
if
that
is
sufficient
you
can
add
to
it
by
the
right
of
the
lord
and
master
for
that
is
just
precisely
what
i
intend
being
until
i
can
turn
you
over
to
your
dawdling
set
in
the
city
again
wait
a
minute
he
added
sternly
as
he
saw
her
lips
opening
to
a
rush
of
words
i
would
be
glad
to
have
you
go
were
conditions
less
exacting
now
i
have
thought
matters
over
and
it
appears
essential
that
certain
of
our
marriage
vows
be
remembered
you
have
to
love
or
honour
but
by
thunder
you
are
going
to
obey
reversion
to
an
ancient
order
of
things
eh
well
the
world
was
better
then
largely
in
that
women
were
worth
a
man
while
further
for
my
part
i
fully
intend
to
keep
my
obligation
of
protecting
you
against
your
own
foolishness
the
storm
gratton
brodie
and
the
devil
himself
and
finally
i
mean
to
keep
my
promise
to
your
father
he
sent
me
to
get
gus
ingle
gold
it
here
so
is
gratton
with
his
crowd
i
will
in
all
probability
have
my
hands
full
but
once
and
for
all
you
stick
with
me
where
he
concluded
with
the
last
jeer
the
wife
place
should
be
gloria
tried
to
stare
him
down
to
wither
him
with
the
fire
of
her
scorn
to
brave
by
him
but
the
man
all
emotion
having
receded
from
his
eyes
was
once
more
like
so
much
rock
but
rock
endowed
with
dormant
power
of
aggression
she
felt
as
though
she
had
to
do
with
a
great
poised
boulder
which
offered
no
menace
so
long
as
she
let
it
alone
but
which
needed
but
an
unwary
step
of
hers
to
destroy
its
equilibrium
and
thus
bring
it
crashing
down
upon
her
crushing
her
she
began
by
wondering
if
she
had
mistaken
his
look
just
now
when
she
had
leaped
to
the
triumphant
decision
that
he
loved
her
she
ended
by
feeling
hopeless
and
tired
and
uncertain
of
all
things
to
keep
him
from
noting
how
she
was
trembling
she
went
hastily
back
to
the
roll
of
bedding
and
dropped
down
to
it
on
the
instant
it
became
clear
to
her
that
physically
king
was
the
master
to
her
before
whom
difficulties
had
heretofore
invariably
melted
it
seemed
equally
clear
that
there
must
be
a
way
out
of
an
unbearable
situation
so
now
for
the
first
time
she
began
a
certain
logical
line
of
thought
seeking
to
shape
her
own
plans
please
listen
to
me
seriously
king
said
quietly
to
her
i
wo
talk
long
to
you
your
father
is
on
the
edge
of
bankruptcy
he
is
temporarily
out
of
the
running
at
the
hands
of
the
very
men
you
want
to
go
to
he
counts
on
me
for
what
is
in
gus
ingle
caves
i
have
found
at
least
a
part
of
it
and
i
honestly
believe
that
it
is
in
your
hands
and
mine
to
pull
ben
through
and
leave
him
a
rich
man
on
top
of
it
gratton
and
brodie
are
down
there
they
clean
us
out
if
they
can
the
stake
is
big
enough
for
them
to
stop
at
nothing
short
of
murder
and
i
am
not
oversure
they
stop
there
gus
ingle
crowd
did
and
i
do
know
that
men
have
changed
much
in
half
a
hundred
years
i
am
listening
said
gloria
coolly
when
he
paused
here
the
point
this
is
we
got
here
first
it
is
up
to
us
to
hold
it
can
i
count
on
you
you
do
happen
to
have
any
love
for
me
well
you
should
have
any
for
gratton
or
brodie
either
and
you
know
that
you
can
trust
yourself
to
me
can
i
count
on
you
sticking
on
the
job
your
father
and
your
own
job
as
much
as
mine
until
we
make
a
go
of
it
gloria
logical
thinking
had
barely
begun
and
as
yet
had
not
had
time
to
progress
her
spite
was
lively
and
bitter
in
her
distorted
vision
blurred
by
passionate
anger
she
cried
out
quickly
so
now
that
the
odds
are
against
you
you
come
cringing
to
me
do
you
again
she
was
misled
into
fancying
that
she
held
a
over
him
answering
your
question
i
would
trust
gratton
any
day
rather
than
you
he
at
least
is
not
quite
the
brute
and
bully
that
you
are
king
was
hardly
disappointed
at
least
you
have
given
a
straight
answer
he
muttered
that
is
something
now
he
shaped
his
plans
swiftly
and
carefully
knowing
where
she
stood
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
once
having
seen
clearly
his
own
responsibility
toward
a
foolish
girl
he
did
not
seek
to
simplify
his
own
difficulty
by
ridding
himself
of
her
henceforth
he
would
merely
consider
her
his
chief
handicap
with
him
but
against
him
he
consoled
himself
with
the
whimsical
thought
that
there
was
never
a
proper
that
did
not
carry
traitorous
mutineers
on
the
questing
ship
and
so
after
all
he
and
gloria
were
not
alone
in
the
mountains
that
other
crowd
was
still
to
be
reckoned
with
king
stood
at
the
mouth
frowning
into
the
smother
of
the
storm
their
smoke
was
gone
again
beaten
down
hidden
behind
the
but
they
were
there
at
no
very
great
distance
thus
then
they
knew
something
just
what
here
was
the
matter
of
his
perplexity
did
they
know
all
that
he
did
or
had
they
merely
such
a
hint
as
would
lead
them
as
close
as
this
or
had
they
followed
his
trail
he
grew
impatient
with
seeking
to
speculate
it
struck
him
clearly
and
forcefully
that
he
had
but
one
thing
to
do
to
trust
that
they
did
not
have
such
full
information
as
had
fallen
into
his
hands
and
to
see
to
it
that
he
gave
them
no
help
though
they
should
come
close
very
close
still
that
which
he
had
found
might
remain
hidden
from
them
there
lay
his
work
to
do
all
that
he
could
to
hide
gus
ingle
gold
first
he
would
bring
with
him
more
than
the
two
nuggets
all
that
he
felt
he
could
manage
to
carry
with
the
rest
of
his
necessary
load
enough
to
help
ben
gaynor
over
a
crisis
enough
raw
gold
to
slam
down
before
some
san
francisco
capitalist
together
with
a
tale
which
would
make
any
man
eager
to
stake
the
owner
to
what
loan
he
asked
with
that
he
seek
to
get
back
to
the
open
he
would
get
provisions
a
if
necessary
a
couple
of
trusted
men
to
come
with
him
he
would
be
back
here
within
the
week
but
first
before
he
went
he
would
strive
to
make
as
sure
as
a
man
could
that
brodie
crowd
did
not
find
the
golden
hoard
he
went
a
second
time
far
back
into
the
darkness
of
the
further
cave
carrying
a
smoking
torch
as
before
vanishing
from
gloria
eyes
she
was
alone
nothing
stood
between
her
and
the
cave
mouth
she
was
free
to
go
he
must
have
thought
of
that
he
was
giving
her
her
chance
she
had
but
to
snatch
up
the
few
things
she
meant
to
take
with
her
to
go
out
to
find
her
way
down
the
cliffs
she
shuddered
she
was
afraid
did
he
know
that
too
had
he
thought
of
that
she
moved
back
and
forth
restlessly
at
one
instant
she
was
sure
that
she
would
go
only
to
be
certain
of
nothing
before
another
second
passed
how
soon
would
he
return
would
he
hurry
after
her
would
he
bring
her
back
forcibly
she
went
where
she
could
look
out
the
column
of
smoke
had
disappeared
the
wind
tore
at
her
in
mighty
gusts
she
hesitated
and
time
passed
how
long
he
was
gone
she
did
not
know
she
only
knew
that
she
had
done
nothing
when
at
length
he
returned
there
was
a
look
of
grim
satisfaction
on
his
face
whatever
he
had
gone
to
do
he
had
done
in
a
manner
to
please
him
she
noted
that
his
coat
was
off
that
in
it
as
in
a
bag
he
carried
something
heavy
this
goes
with
us
wherever
we
go
he
announced
triumphantly
it
a
big
breathing
spell
for
ben
gaynor
he
dumped
it
out
there
were
other
lumps
like
the
two
he
had
brought
back
the
first
time
she
wondered
dully
if
that
grimy
stuff
were
gold
she
watched
him
while
he
emptied
a
and
thereafter
dropped
into
it
the
stuff
he
had
brought
in
his
coat
on
top
of
it
went
the
articles
of
food
if
you
can
whip
up
enough
endurance
for
the
work
ahead
of
us
he
announced
impersonally
we
stand
a
good
chance
of
getting
out
of
this
otherwise
we
stand
a
whole
lot
better
show
of
being
caught
here
and
freezing
and
starving
to
death
gloria
shook
visibly
nervousness
and
fear
and
the
cold
were
combined
and
merciless
her
look
sped
from
king
face
to
what
she
could
see
of
the
but
we
wait
she
asked
in
utter
weary
meekness
until
this
horrible
storm
is
over
one
never
knows
about
a
storm
like
this
he
told
her
it
may
blow
itself
out
soon
and
it
may
keep
on
for
a
long
time
now
it
beginning
to
pile
up
in
the
drifts
to
hide
the
trails
to
make
going
harder
every
minute
as
it
is
we
have
our
work
cut
out
for
us
if
this
keeps
up
all
afternoon
and
all
night
he
shrugged
you
mean
that
then
we
could
get
out
at
all
she
asked
sharply
he
looked
down
on
her
thoughtfully
i
do
know
he
replied
slowly
whether
you
could
make
it
then
or
not
i
am
more
or
less
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
and
you
are
not
i
figure
that
we
ought
to
take
no
more
long
shots
than
we
have
to
if
we
start
right
now
and
have
any
luck
we
can
make
several
miles
before
night
and
camp
in
some
of
the
thick
timber
we
be
as
well
off
there
as
we
are
here
and
just
that
much
nearer
the
outside
if
the
weather
allowed
us
to
travel
at
all
we
could
be
back
at
your
father
place
in
four
or
five
days
at
the
longest
and
he
added
significantly
we
have
food
to
last
us
just
about
that
long
gloria
sprang
up
hastily
quick
she
cried
let
hurry
king
nodded
and
began
his
preparations
into
the
squares
of
canvas
he
rolled
everything
they
were
to
take
with
them
and
he
took
no
single
article
which
he
judged
was
not
absolutely
necessary
one
small
and
one
light
aluminium
pot
with
single
knife
fork
and
spoon
constituted
all
in
the
way
of
cooking
utensils
with
jealous
eye
he
judged
the
weight
bulk
and
worth
of
every
other
article
whether
it
be
a
tin
of
fruit
or
a
slab
of
bacon
those
delicacies
which
his
love
for
gloria
had
prompted
him
to
bring
with
them
he
now
placed
at
one
side
to
be
left
behind
bacon
to
the
last
small
scrap
and
rind
coffee
to
the
dregs
in
the
he
packed
carefully
then
his
roll
made
and
drawn
tight
he
took
up
the
discarded
articles
and
hid
them
under
some
loose
dirt
in
a
remote
black
corner
of
the
cave
ten
minutes
later
he
had
gotten
first
his
pack
then
gloria
safely
down
the
cliffs
and
they
started
head
down
silent
like
two
grotesque
automatons
they
trudged
on
they
crossed
on
the
fallen
cedar
they
climbed
out
of
the
gorge
on
the
far
side
they
fought
their
way
on
several
times
king
turned
but
she
soon
saw
it
was
not
to
look
at
her
his
glance
passed
down
the
long
cañon
toward
the
spot
where
they
had
seen
the
smudge
of
smoke
she
had
come
near
forgetting
that
other
men
were
near
she
had
no
interest
in
them
now
king
had
brought
her
here
king
must
take
her
safely
back
to
the
world
which
she
had
forsaken
so
stupidly
the
obligation
was
plainly
his
the
power
seemed
his
no
less
as
gloria
fought
her
way
along
she
was
upborne
at
every
step
by
the
expectation
of
coming
presently
to
their
horse
of
being
placed
in
the
saddle
and
of
having
nothing
to
do
from
then
on
but
hold
to
the
pommel
and
have
king
lead
her
on
to
an
ultimate
safety
the
progress
would
be
long
and
the
way
little
less
than
an
adventure
in
hell
to
her
but
at
least
hers
would
have
become
a
slightly
more
passive
part
and
she
would
be
moving
on
toward
the
luxury
of
four
walls
and
a
maid
and
warm
comforts
so
when
they
came
to
the
spot
where
king
had
tethered
his
horse
and
there
was
no
horse
there
gloria
looked
her
blank
stupefied
bewilderment
and
then
simply
collapsed
she
dropped
down
in
the
snow
her
face
in
her
hands
too
weary
and
heartbroken
to
sob
aloud
king
stared
about
him
with
an
almost
equal
consternation
leaving
gloria
where
she
lay
inert
in
the
snow
king
put
down
rifle
and
pack
and
hurried
down
into
the
hollow
where
he
had
tethered
his
horse
five
minutes
of
reading
the
signs
in
the
snow
told
him
the
story
he
had
been
right
his
venture
from
the
beginning
had
been
loaded
to
the
guards
with
bad
luck
there
was
the
end
of
the
broken
there
the
tracks
showing
the
way
buck
had
gone
in
full
headlong
flight
the
rope
was
stout
and
would
have
broken
only
were
the
animal
terrified
if
frightened
then
there
had
been
something
to
cause
fright
again
since
the
horse
fled
straight
down
the
slope
that
something
startling
it
would
have
been
at
some
point
directly
above
king
turned
and
mounted
to
the
ridge
top
again
here
were
other
tracks
all
but
obliterated
by
the
snow
which
had
fallen
since
they
were
made
a
bear
had
come
up
over
the
ridge
had
frightened
the
horse
into
breaking
its
tether
and
running
and
the
equally
startled
bear
had
turned
tail
and
raced
off
the
other
way
both
animals
were
probably
a
dozen
miles
off
by
now
the
bear
perhaps
twice
that
distance
king
came
back
slowly
and
sat
down
on
his
pack
from
gloria
dejected
figure
he
looked
to
his
watch
from
his
watch
again
to
the
four
points
of
the
compass
his
lips
tightened
the
afternoon
was
passing
and
the
dark
would
come
early
are
you
up
to
crowding
ahead
on
foot
he
called
to
gloria
if
you
have
the
nerve
we
can
really
make
better
time
that
way
anyhow
from
now
on
can
you
do
it
at
first
she
did
not
try
to
answer
but
when
he
shouted
to
her
again
his
voice
hard
with
anger
she
moaned
miserably
i
am
sick
i
am
dying
i
think
i
ca
go
on
king
grunted
disgustedly
he
let
gloria
lie
where
she
was
until
she
had
rested
then
he
went
to
her
and
put
his
hands
under
her
arms
and
lifted
her
to
her
feet
she
was
limp
and
pale
her
eyes
shut
her
lashes
looking
unusually
black
against
the
pallor
of
her
pinched
cheeks
we
go
back
to
the
cave
for
the
night
after
all
he
told
her
quietly
it
the
inevitable
and
that
one
thing
there
no
sense
bucking
against
stand
up
but
the
slight
figure
in
its
boyish
garb
drooped
against
him
head
moved
the
slightest
bit
in
sidewise
negation
her
pale
lips
stirred
soundlessly
what
asked
king
i
ca
came
her
whisper
he
judged
that
here
was
no
time
for
foolishness
but
rather
the
time
for
each
one
to
do
his
part
if
the
two
of
them
lived
to
make
all
of
this
an
unpleasant
memory
you
got
to
he
informed
her
crisply
i
ca
carry
you
and
the
pack
and
rifle
and
everything
can
i
i
am
going
back
the
rest
is
up
to
you
do
you
want
to
lie
here
and
die
i
do
care
said
gloria
listlessly
he
looked
at
her
curiously
as
he
drew
his
hands
away
she
slipped
down
and
lay
as
she
had
lain
before
he
turned
away
took
up
his
pack
and
gun
set
his
back
square
upon
her
and
trudged
off
toward
the
only
shelter
that
was
theirs
along
the
ridge
buffeted
by
the
wind
half
blind
with
the
flurries
of
stinging
hail
with
which
that
wind
lashed
him
as
with
countless
bits
of
broken
glass
he
did
not
turn
to
look
behind
him
not
until
he
had
gone
fully
half
of
the
way
to
the
cave
then
he
did
turn
he
could
not
see
her
following
as
he
had
pictured
her
he
dropped
his
burden
and
went
back
to
her
she
lay
as
he
had
left
her
her
face
whiter
than
he
had
ever
seen
it
her
eyes
shut
certain
small
blue
veins
making
a
delicate
tracery
across
the
lids
he
had
meant
to
storm
at
her
to
stir
her
into
activity
by
the
lashings
of
his
rage
but
instead
he
stooped
and
gathered
her
up
into
his
arms
and
carried
her
through
the
storm
shielding
her
body
all
that
he
could
and
as
he
stooped
and
as
he
moved
off
he
was
growling
deep
down
in
his
throat
like
a
disgruntled
old
bear
when
it
came
to
clambering
down
and
then
up
the
cliffs
gloria
obeyed
his
commands
listlessly
and
as
in
a
dream
lending
the
certain
small
aid
that
was
necessary
even
so
the
climb
was
hard
and
slow
and
more
than
ever
before
filled
with
danger
but
in
the
end
it
was
done
again
they
were
in
gus
ingle
cave
king
built
a
fire
left
gloria
lying
by
it
and
went
back
for
his
pack
when
he
returned
she
had
not
moved
he
made
a
bed
for
her
placed
her
on
it
so
that
her
feet
were
toward
the
fire
and
covered
her
with
his
own
blanket
then
he
boiled
some
coffee
and
made
her
drink
it
she
obeyed
again
neither
thanked
him
nor
upbraided
him
and
drooped
back
upon
her
hard
bed
and
shut
her
eyes
here
was
a
new
gloria
a
gloria
who
did
not
care
whether
she
lived
or
died
with
a
quickening
alarm
in
his
eyes
he
stood
by
the
smoky
fire
staring
at
her
uninured
to
hardship
her
delicate
body
was
already
beaten
with
still
further
hardship
to
come
might
she
not
die
and
what
would
mark
king
say
to
ben
gaynor
even
if
he
brought
back
much
raw
red
gold
if
it
had
cost
the
life
of
ben
gaynor
daughter
she
did
not
stir
when
he
came
to
her
and
knelt
and
put
his
hand
against
her
cheek
he
was
shocked
to
learn
how
cold
she
was
lightly
he
set
his
fingers
against
her
softly
pulsing
throat
it
was
cold
like
ice
plainly
she
was
chilled
through
as
he
began
unlacing
her
boots
a
curiously
bitter
thought
came
to
him
she
was
his
the
marriage
service
had
given
her
to
him
with
her
own
willingness
his
wife
and
now
he
was
doing
for
her
the
first
intimate
little
thing
he
drew
off
her
boots
and
stockings
and
found
that
her
feet
were
terribly
cold
he
wrapped
them
in
a
hot
blanket
and
hastened
to
set
a
pot
of
water
on
the
coals
while
the
water
warmed
he
knelt
and
chafed
her
feet
between
his
palms
afraid
for
a
moment
that
they
were
frozen
finally
while
he
bathed
them
in
steaming
water
the
dead
white
began
to
give
place
to
a
faint
pinkness
like
a
blush
and
again
he
put
the
blanket
about
them
she
had
not
moved
when
a
second
time
he
laid
his
hand
against
her
throat
the
cold
of
it
alarmed
him
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
the
urgent
need
being
more
than
evident
he
began
swiftly
to
undo
her
outer
garments
the
boyish
shirt
he
unbuttoned
and
managed
to
remove
it
was
wet
through
and
stiff
with
frost
he
noted
her
silken
and
foolish
little
things
with
amazement
she
had
known
no
better
than
to
wear
such
nonsensical
affairs
on
a
trip
like
this
good
god
what
she
know
but
he
did
not
pause
in
his
labours
until
he
had
slipped
off
the
wet
clothing
then
he
wrapped
her
in
another
warm
blanket
and
placed
her
on
her
bed
her
feet
still
to
the
blaze
all
of
the
time
she
had
seemed
and
probably
was
hardly
conscious
now
only
she
opened
her
eyes
i
ca
have
you
playing
the
fool
and
getting
pneumonia
he
growled
at
her
we
got
our
hands
full
as
it
is
do
you
know
enough
to
but
she
was
not
listening
she
stirred
slightly
eased
herself
into
a
new
position
cuddled
her
face
against
a
bare
arm
sighed
and
went
to
sleep
all
night
king
kept
his
fire
blazing
with
several
long
sticks
and
a
piece
of
the
canvas
drawing
deeply
upon
his
ingenuity
and
almost
to
the
dregs
of
his
patience
he
contrived
a
rude
barrier
to
the
cold
across
the
mouth
of
the
cave
countless
times
he
rolled
out
of
his
own
bunk
and
stiff
to
readjust
the
screen
when
it
had
blown
down
to
put
more
wood
on
his
fire
to
make
sure
that
gloria
was
covered
and
warm
sleeping
heavily
and
not
dead
his
nerves
were
frayed
in
the
long
night
his
fears
grew
misshapen
and
grotesque
within
his
soul
he
prayed
mutely
that
when
morning
came
gloria
would
be
alive
when
with
the
first
sickly
streaks
of
dawn
he
went
to
put
fresh
fuel
upon
the
dying
embers
he
found
that
there
was
but
a
handful
of
wood
left
he
came
to
stoop
over
the
girl
and
listen
to
her
breathing
then
he
descended
the
cliffs
for
more
wood
during
the
night
winter
had
set
the
white
seal
of
his
sovereignty
upon
the
world
the
snarling
wind
had
died
in
its
own
fierceness
giving
over
to
a
still
calm
air
through
which
steadily
the
big
flakes
fell
now
they
clung
to
bush
and
tree
everywhere
the
limbs
had
grown
thick
and
heavy
drooping
like
countless
plumes
fat
mats
of
snow
lay
on
the
level
spaces
upon
flat
rocks
curling
over
and
down
at
the
edges
where
he
stood
king
sank
in
the
fluffy
stuff
as
he
moved
along
the
cliffs
and
down
the
slope
toward
a
dead
tree
he
stepped
now
and
then
into
drifts
where
the
snow
was
gathering
swiftly
as
he
looked
up
seeking
to
penetrate
the
skies
above
him
and
judge
their
import
he
saw
only
myriads
of
grey
particles
high
up
swirling
but
slightly
in
some
softly
stirring
for
the
most
part
dropping
floating
falling
almost
vertically
nowhere
was
there
a
hint
or
hope
of
cessation
the
winter
a
full
four
weeks
early
had
come
in
the
noose
of
his
rope
he
dragged
up
the
cliff
much
dead
wood
riven
from
a
fallen
pine
throughout
the
noise
of
his
comings
and
goings
the
girl
slept
heavily
he
got
a
big
fire
blazing
without
waking
her
and
set
about
getting
breakfast
while
he
waited
for
the
coffee
to
boil
he
took
careful
stock
of
provisions
for
two
people
there
was
enough
for
some
twenty
meals
food
for
about
a
week
time
to
conserve
the
grease
from
the
to
hoard
the
smallest
bit
of
bacon
rind
he
even
counted
his
rounds
of
ammunition
here
alone
he
was
affluent
he
had
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
hundred
cartridges
for
the
rifle
while
he
was
setting
the
gun
aside
he
felt
gloria
eyes
upon
him
during
the
night
and
now
during
this
inventory
he
had
been
granted
both
ample
time
and
cause
for
his
decision
he
addressed
her
with
prompt
frankness
inside
fifteen
minutes
we
got
to
be
on
our
way
out
as
we
go
look
for
the
horse
but
find
it
or
not
we
going
she
lay
looking
up
at
him
thoughtfully
she
had
rested
she
resented
his
coolly
assumed
mastery
she
had
not
forgotten
that
there
were
other
men
near
by
but
she
merely
said
by
way
of
beginning
the
storm
is
over
then
no
but
we
are
not
going
to
wait
we
have
food
for
only
six
or
seven
days
at
the
most
she
let
her
eyes
droop
to
the
fire
so
that
the
lids
hid
them
from
him
it
was
not
yet
full
day
it
was
still
snowing
gratton
and
the
men
with
him
would
of
course
have
ample
supplies
she
yearned
feverishly
to
be
rid
of
king
and
his
intolerable
domineering
she
estimated
swiftly
that
paradoxically
her
only
power
over
him
was
that
of
powerlessness
while
she
lay
here
hers
was
in
a
way
the
advantage
on
her
feet
following
him
he
would
be
again
to
her
the
brute
he
had
been
coming
in
i
am
tired
out
she
said
faintly
still
not
looking
up
i
am
sick
i
have
a
pain
here
she
moved
her
hand
to
her
side
where
in
reality
she
was
conscious
of
a
troublesome
soreness
i
ca
go
on
he
stared
at
her
she
was
pale
now
that
she
lifted
her
eyes
for
a
brief
reading
of
his
look
he
remarked
that
they
appeared
unusually
large
and
luminous
there
was
a
flush
on
her
cheeks
his
old
fear
surged
back
on
him
gloria
was
going
to
die
so
he
did
what
gloria
had
counted
on
having
him
do
put
milk
and
sugar
in
her
coffee
and
brought
the
cup
to
her
he
hastened
to
serve
her
a
breakfast
of
crisp
bacon
hot
cakes
and
jam
he
urged
her
to
eat
and
made
his
own
meal
of
unsweetened
black
coffee
and
cakes
without
jam
triumphantly
and
covertly
gloria
observed
all
of
this
hers
was
the
victory
mark
king
was
again
waiting
on
her
hand
and
foot
sacrificing
for
her
he
allowed
himself
half
a
pipe
of
tobacco
tobacco
like
food
was
going
to
run
out
soon
and
smoked
sombrely
here
already
was
the
thing
to
be
dreaded
more
than
aught
else
gloria
threatened
with
illness
as
ben
gaynor
daughter
never
as
his
own
beloved
wife
she
had
become
his
responsibility
she
was
a
parcel
marked
fragile
handle
with
care
which
he
had
undertaken
to
deliver
safely
to
a
friend
i
am
going
to
look
for
the
horse
he
told
her
he
got
to
his
feet
and
took
up
his
rifle
but
do
count
too
much
on
my
success
all
the
chances
are
that
buck
is
a
long
way
on
the
trail
back
to
his
stable
blackie
has
probably
limped
back
home
by
now
another
thing
if
i
get
buck
he
be
of
no
use
to
us
that
is
if
the
snow
keeps
on
but
i
do
what
i
can
but
before
leaving
he
did
what
he
could
to
make
for
her
comfort
during
his
absence
he
brought
up
making
them
into
a
bed
for
her
he
readjusted
his
canvas
screen
securing
it
more
carefully
thereby
making
the
cave
somewhat
more
snug
and
at
the
last
he
dropped
a
little
book
at
her
side
she
did
not
know
he
had
it
with
him
she
did
not
appear
to
note
it
until
he
had
gone
then
she
took
it
up
curiously
a
volume
of
kipling
poems
compact
and
companionable
on
india
paper
between
worn
covers
with
a
little
sniff
she
put
the
book
down
just
the
sort
of
thing
for
mark
king
to
read
she
thought
with
fine
scorn
and
utterly
stupid
to
gloria
what
had
she
to
do
with
and
and
and
feet
of
the
young
less
than
nothing
in
sheer
regrettable
fact
she
knew
he
had
one
other
book
with
him
gus
ingle
bible
the
profaned
volume
of
a
murderous
scoundrel
what
a
library
for
a
dainty
lady
gloria
suddenly
found
that
she
could
have
screamed
she
scrambled
up
and
went
to
peer
out
around
the
canvas
screen
no
sound
out
there
for
the
wind
was
dead
and
the
snow
dropped
noiselessly
the
creek
in
the
gorge
because
what
little
draught
there
was
in
the
air
bore
down
the
canon
sent
no
sound
to
her
ears
the
wilderness
of
crag
and
peak
and
distant
forest
was
hostile
pitiless
she
sought
eagerly
for
some
sign
of
gratton
there
was
none
no
smoke
this
morning
denoted
his
camp
no
figure
toiled
upward
toward
her
but
he
would
come
soon
he
must
king
had
found
the
gold
here
gratton
would
know
and
come
she
would
wait
hoping
for
gratton
coming
before
king
return
meanwhile
king
making
his
way
down
the
mountain
slope
found
that
his
estimate
of
the
storm
was
cheerlessly
correct
the
fluffy
stuff
underfoot
was
in
places
already
and
mounting
steadily
higher
he
shook
himself
and
growled
in
his
throat
and
ploughed
through
it
vigorously
a
pair
of
webs
would
look
like
wings
before
long
he
muttered
well
we
make
since
we
ca
buy
making
his
way
back
to
the
point
where
buck
had
broken
his
tether
king
overlooked
no
precaution
since
he
did
not
care
to
have
his
and
known
unnecessarily
to
gratton
and
his
following
he
forsook
the
natural
pathway
and
made
slower
hard
progress
along
the
gorge
where
others
would
be
less
likely
to
chance
upon
his
tracks
and
where
the
tracks
themselves
would
soonest
fill
with
drifting
snow
passing
about
many
a
stunted
grove
he
came
at
last
to
the
place
whence
buck
had
fled
he
knew
that
in
the
general
direction
indicated
by
the
line
of
flight
beyond
two
ridges
was
the
valley
of
the
giant
sequoias
there
a
horse
would
find
water
shelter
and
grass
if
he
failed
to
find
the
animal
there
well
then
buck
was
well
on
the
trail
or
lost
to
king
in
any
one
of
a
hundred
places
and
always
as
he
went
panting
up
and
ploughing
down
the
steep
slopes
his
eyes
were
keen
for
meat
be
it
douglas
squirrel
or
bear
but
the
woods
seemed
deserted
and
empty
only
those
cheerful
impudent
little
bundles
of
feathers
the
snowbirds
and
an
occasional
darting
along
the
creeks
these
he
let
alone
but
with
the
mental
reservation
that
the
time
might
well
be
at
hand
when
even
such
as
they
must
be
called
on
to
keep
life
in
him
and
gloria
he
had
taken
on
a
contract
for
his
morning
work
and
drove
his
big
body
at
it
relentlessly
and
he
took
his
own
sort
of
joy
from
it
the
joy
of
a
fight
against
odds
the
joy
of
action
in
the
open
his
body
was
wet
with
sweat
but
neither
his
ardour
nor
optimism
were
dampened
his
foot
came
perilously
near
after
he
slipped
into
the
hidden
water
of
a
small
stream
but
he
considered
the
accident
but
a
part
of
the
day
work
so
prepared
by
common
sense
for
disappointment
he
looked
hopefully
to
finding
the
horse
and
as
he
pushed
on
he
pondered
other
likely
spots
to
seek
this
afternoon
or
if
he
did
not
find
the
animal
in
the
sequoias
when
at
last
he
came
to
the
grove
of
big
trees
he
was
among
old
friends
but
he
knew
almost
as
soon
as
he
reached
them
that
they
had
no
word
for
him
on
his
wedding
morning
he
had
planned
how
he
would
bring
gloria
here
taking
it
for
granted
in
his
blind
infatuation
that
they
would
mean
to
her
what
they
had
meant
to
him
now
he
passed
swiftly
like
a
noiseless
shadow
between
the
gigantic
boles
he
did
not
lift
his
head
to
look
at
old
vulcan
crest
two
hundred
feet
in
air
all
but
lost
up
there
in
the
falling
snow
he
gave
no
thought
to
the
thousands
of
years
which
were
majesty
and
thor
he
went
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
seeking
tracks
of
a
horse
and
as
he
had
more
than
half
expected
he
found
nothing
the
magnificent
vistas
carpeted
in
snow
gave
him
no
view
of
anything
but
snow
later
he
must
cudgel
his
brains
and
seek
elsewhere
now
with
other
work
to
be
done
he
should
go
back
the
shortest
quickest
way
so
he
set
his
feet
into
the
trail
which
they
had
made
and
turned
his
back
upon
the
grove
where
he
crossed
streams
he
took
stock
of
pools
there
were
trout
there
if
a
man
could
take
them
this
was
another
matter
to
see
about
oh
he
would
be
busy
enough
and
yet
he
did
not
loiter
and
stopped
only
briefly
and
infrequently
to
rest
before
returning
to
gloria
king
meant
to
look
in
on
brodie
camp
if
only
from
a
distance
as
matters
stood
now
there
was
no
telling
what
bearing
gratton
and
brodie
actions
might
have
later
upon
his
own
affairs
it
would
be
well
to
note
if
the
men
were
preparing
to
fight
the
storm
out
or
to
pack
up
and
leave
rather
than
take
prolonged
chances
with
the
season
so
a
mile
below
his
own
camp
he
slipped
into
a
grove
of
firs
and
made
his
unseen
way
toward
the
fringe
whence
he
counted
upon
seeing
what
they
were
about
he
was
still
moving
on
slowly
and
had
had
no
glimpse
of
the
men
when
he
heard
them
he
stopped
abruptly
and
listened
they
were
down
there
against
the
cañon
wall
words
came
to
him
indistinctly
muffled
by
the
thick
air
the
tones
of
the
voices
were
unmistakable
three
voices
there
were
each
with
its
own
peculiarity
none
of
them
gratton
first
a
big
booming
voice
then
a
sharp
voice
thereafter
a
querulous
utterance
nervous
and
irritable
disagreement
if
not
quarrel
had
already
come
to
camp
king
moved
a
few
paces
nearer
pushed
aside
a
low
branch
from
which
the
snow
dropped
with
little
thuds
and
saw
the
men
there
were
four
of
them
in
an
excited
group
and
slightly
drawn
apart
one
hand
at
his
mouth
was
gratton
the
four
paid
no
attention
to
him
but
formed
a
group
exclusively
of
these
four
one
now
held
his
own
counsel
his
attitude
alert
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
head
turning
swiftly
so
that
his
eyes
were
now
on
one
speaker
now
on
another
across
the
brief
distance
king
could
see
the
puffs
of
smoke
from
the
pipe
in
his
teeth
the
man
wore
a
red
handkerchief
knotted
about
his
throat
its
colour
was
as
bright
as
blood
swen
brodie
now
and
then
as
a
voice
was
lifted
king
caught
a
word
repeated
several
times
he
heard
the
word
bacon
here
doubtless
was
the
matter
under
discussion
one
man
he
of
the
thin
querulous
voice
swung
his
nervous
arm
widely
and
fairly
shrieked
his
message
it
came
in
little
puffs
and
was
lost
between
king
heard
him
shout
bacon
and
snow
and
hell
the
three
expressions
so
oddly
connected
and
yet
disjointed
were
significant
gratton
stood
apart
and
gnawed
at
his
hand
though
he
could
not
see
the
prominent
eyes
king
could
imagine
the
look
in
them
swen
brodie
puffed
regularly
at
his
pipe
and
watched
and
listened
intently
abruptly
the
wrangling
knot
of
men
resolved
itself
into
two
definite
factions
his
fellows
had
turned
upon
the
man
plainly
in
some
sort
of
denunciation
or
accusation
he
was
the
smallest
of
the
lot
and
drew
back
hastily
step
after
step
offering
the
of
his
curses
as
the
others
clubbed
their
fists
a
lie
he
shrieked
fools
gratton
gnawed
at
his
knuckles
brodie
puffed
steadily
and
the
two
aggressors
accepted
windy
denial
as
sign
of
guilt
one
of
them
sprang
forward
and
struck
the
little
man
whipped
out
a
revolver
and
fired
the
shot
sounded
dull
and
muffled
a
puff
of
smoke
hung
for
a
moment
like
the
smoke
from
the
pipe
appearing
methodically
between
the
passive
onlooker
teeth
the
man
who
had
struck
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
there
came
a
second
shot
then
in
sharp
staccato
succession
four
others
followed
by
the
ugly
little
metallic
click
announcing
that
the
gun
had
emptied
itself
before
the
last
explosion
the
balancing
body
sagged
limply
and
sprawled
in
the
snow
king
first
natural
impulse
was
to
break
through
the
brush
and
run
forward
but
his
caution
of
the
day
commanded
by
circumstance
though
never
a
part
of
the
man
headlong
nature
remained
with
him
counselling
cool
thought
instead
of
hot
haste
the
man
down
was
dead
or
as
good
as
dead
him
king
could
not
help
so
he
held
back
and
watched
there
fell
a
brief
silence
while
the
man
who
had
done
the
shooting
and
the
men
about
him
no
less
than
the
figure
lying
in
the
snow
were
as
motionless
as
so
many
carven
statues
at
last
brodie
spoke
heavily
benny
right
bates
had
it
coming
to
him
times
like
this
stealing
a
side
of
bacon
is
murder
bates
stole
it
he
was
going
to
try
to
us
and
beat
it
out
of
here
now
he
dead
and
good
riddance
he
spat
into
the
snow
when
he
had
done
benny
chattering
wildly
to
himself
now
began
a
hasty
reloading
of
his
revolver
the
man
whom
he
had
shot
whom
brodie
named
bates
lay
not
five
steps
from
benny
feet
his
blood
already
congealing
where
it
flushed
the
snow
oddly
enough
king
knew
personally
or
by
repute
each
of
the
men
before
him
with
the
single
exception
of
the
man
who
had
paid
in
full
for
his
own
or
some
one
else
crime
of
stealing
food
at
a
time
when
food
meant
a
chance
for
life
to
begin
with
there
was
swen
brodie
and
there
was
gratton
there
was
benny
who
had
done
the
killing
a
degenerate
a
morphine
addict
and
a
scoundrel
beyond
him
stood
the
burly
ruffian
of
the
big
awkward
bony
frame
who
had
brought
the
judge
to
the
log
house
the
other
night
at
bidding
steve
jarrold
through
the
trees
coming
up
now
were
two
more
of
the
party
a
swart
squat
italian
and
just
at
his
heels
a
ragged
scarecrow
of
a
man
named
brail
it
was
brail
who
came
close
enough
to
stoop
over
the
fallen
man
dead
ai
he
queried
benny
over
his
words
his
fellows
had
drawn
closer
so
that
they
stood
in
a
ring
about
the
body
one
man
alone
held
apart
gratton
eyes
were
wild
void
of
purpose
the
dead
of
his
face
turned
a
sickly
greenish
tinge
after
a
little
while
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
he
began
a
slow
withdrawal
moving
jerkily
step
by
step
his
dragging
heels
making
long
furrows
in
the
snow
then
king
too
began
to
draw
back
slipping
quietly
and
swiftly
through
the
screen
of
tree
and
bush
stepping
in
the
tracks
he
had
made
coming
hither
praying
suddenly
for
further
snow
to
hide
or
obliterate
the
trail
he
had
made
and
for
the
moment
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
gold
which
they
too
sought
and
which
he
had
meant
to
snatch
away
from
under
their
noses
he
thought
only
of
gloria
if
that
crowd
in
its
present
temper
found
the
way
to
his
camp
if
in
one
way
or
another
gloria
fell
into
their
hands
then
could
she
thank
god
for
a
clean
bullet
and
a
swift
end
of
things
the
mere
fact
of
being
absolutely
alone
from
midday
to
dark
would
have
been
for
gloria
an
experience
at
any
time
and
in
any
environment
of
her
friends
in
the
city
there
were
many
who
had
never
in
a
lifetime
known
what
it
was
to
spend
half
a
dozen
consecutive
daytime
waking
hours
in
perfect
solitude
catching
not
so
much
as
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
a
servant
a
policeman
a
nurse
or
a
conductor
in
the
echoing
street
solitude
rendered
rippleless
by
an
absence
of
any
familiar
sound
neither
the
whisk
of
a
maid
broom
the
clang
of
a
telephone
bell
the
buzz
of
motors
or
the
slamming
of
doors
at
those
intervals
when
king
thought
of
her
it
was
to
realize
that
she
might
quite
naturally
find
discomfort
in
her
bleak
surroundings
being
denied
and
upholstered
chair
it
did
not
suggest
itself
to
him
that
the
chief
discomfort
would
be
a
terrifying
loneliness
she
told
herself
when
he
had
gone
that
she
was
glad
to
be
alone
five
minutes
later
she
began
to
stir
restlessly
another
five
minutes
and
already
she
was
listening
for
his
return
never
once
during
the
day
was
there
a
sudden
or
unexpected
sound
whether
the
snapping
of
a
burning
faggot
or
the
scratching
against
the
rock
of
a
log
rolling
apart
or
the
flap
of
her
canvas
that
she
did
not
look
expectantly
toward
the
rude
door
through
which
she
thought
to
see
him
returning
once
that
her
restlessness
came
upon
her
she
could
not
remain
quiet
she
drew
on
her
boots
and
walked
up
and
down
casting
fearsome
glances
toward
the
darkest
portion
of
the
cavern
shunning
it
keeping
the
fire
between
it
and
herself
when
she
peered
out
across
the
desolate
world
she
drew
back
from
its
bleak
menace
shuddering
returning
to
crouch
miserably
by
her
fire
shut
in
between
two
frightful
things
the
black
unknown
of
the
bowels
of
the
cave
the
white
horror
of
the
brutal
insensate
wilderness
and
in
her
almost
hysterical
emotional
frenzy
she
saw
back
of
each
of
them
the
man
mark
king
as
though
they
were
but
the
expressions
of
his
own
brutality
after
an
hour
she
felt
that
she
would
go
mad
unless
she
found
something
to
hold
her
mind
back
from
those
hideous
channels
into
which
it
slipped
so
readily
she
snatched
up
the
book
which
king
had
left
with
her
and
forced
herself
to
read
pages
eluded
her
but
here
and
there
single
lines
or
words
caught
her
attention
as
a
thorny
copse
catches
and
plucks
the
garments
of
one
going
blindly
through
it
so
she
was
arrested
by
the
line
simpleness
and
gentleness
and
honour
and
clean
and
this
was
one
of
the
times
when
she
threw
the
book
down
and
got
up
and
walked
back
and
forth
impatiently
it
was
almost
as
though
king
had
left
the
wretched
volume
behind
to
be
his
spokesman
in
his
absence
she
told
herself
angrily
that
he
was
like
that
had
never
been
like
that
he
was
a
mere
brute
of
a
man
not
as
fought
and
sailed
and
ruled
and
loved
and
made
our
he
was
rather
unthinkably
crude
and
boorish
and
detestable
but
rebelling
at
utter
loneliness
she
was
forced
again
and
again
to
the
only
companion
at
hand
she
read
fascinated
in
a
shivery
uncanny
way
by
the
first
line
as
though
a
ghostly
voice
were
whispering
to
her
from
the
black
corners
of
the
cave
no
sense
in
going
further
it
the
edge
of
and
later
faced
the
sheer
whipping
up
and
leading
others
than
she
had
gone
into
the
last
solitudes
others
who
had
joyed
in
it
and
sung
of
it
it
was
as
though
the
dead
shades
of
those
others
squatted
at
the
edges
of
her
fire
and
mocked
at
her
then
she
could
fancy
that
it
was
king
himself
jeering
and
that
he
cried
he
chose
me
for
his
whisper
and
i
found
it
and
it
yours
she
snapped
the
book
shut
later
she
opened
it
to
the
tale
of
tomlinson
she
did
not
entirely
grasp
it
but
she
could
not
entirely
miss
what
it
said
she
hurried
on
she
wondered
vaguely
at
the
call
of
the
red
gods
here
again
seeking
distraction
she
was
whipped
back
to
reality
there
were
the
lines
staring
at
her
as
though
king
had
rewritten
kipling
hath
smelt
at
twilight
who
hath
heard
the
birch
log
burning
who
is
quick
to
read
the
noises
of
the
night
and
the
answer
was
mark
king
even
now
it
was
a
torturous
twilight
in
the
cave
even
now
she
smelled
even
now
she
was
like
one
starting
at
the
noises
of
the
night
she
thought
contemptuously
she
had
heard
such
an
expression
used
in
connection
with
the
verses
of
this
uncouth
scribe
it
did
not
strike
her
that
might
well
enough
be
also
being
one
or
the
other
or
both
for
the
sheer
reason
that
it
was
human
she
chose
to
consider
it
merely
the
sort
of
coarse
food
for
male
mental
digestion
a
man
nature
was
not
fine
and
intricate
rather
his
emotional
qualities
must
be
like
stubby
blunt
callous
fingers
unskilled
and
not
highly
sentient
a
man
lacked
the
psychical
and
spiritual
and
intellectual
development
which
was
that
of
a
maid
like
gloria
his
joys
were
chiefly
physical
so
he
cared
to
blaze
trails
like
the
explorer
the
impact
of
a
storm
buffeting
and
the
low
appreciation
of
a
full
stomach
drew
limits
marking
his
possibilities
of
expansion
he
was
a
beast
and
she
hated
the
whole
sex
sweepingly
and
superbly
in
great
surges
of
genuine
sympathy
her
heart
went
out
to
herself
but
after
all
the
moments
in
which
her
thoughts
were
snared
away
from
her
fears
and
the
oppression
of
loneliness
were
few
and
short
from
wondering
what
kept
king
she
passed
to
bitter
anger
that
he
should
desert
her
so
she
concluded
that
he
was
doing
it
with
malicious
intent
repeatedly
she
was
tempted
to
go
forth
and
seek
gratton
to
hunt
up
and
down
until
at
last
she
came
to
him
again
and
again
she
went
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
looked
forth
but
each
time
she
drew
back
terrified
at
the
thought
of
making
her
way
unaided
down
the
sheer
cliff
wall
she
sought
to
tell
herself
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
the
snow
of
being
lost
of
being
unable
to
find
gratton
but
she
could
not
climb
down
the
cliff
she
knew
that
she
would
fall
dizzy
and
sick
shivering
with
dread
and
cold
she
turned
back
always
she
let
her
fire
die
down
not
noticing
it
then
the
cold
reminded
her
and
she
worked
long
building
another
she
knew
where
a
block
of
matches
was
she
had
seen
king
set
it
carefully
away
in
her
excitement
she
struck
dozens
of
matches
dropping
the
burnt
ends
about
her
at
last
her
fire
blazed
up
and
she
warmed
herself
then
she
was
conscious
of
a
strange
faintness
and
realized
that
she
was
hungry
she
went
to
their
food
cache
and
ransacked
it
hastily
she
opened
a
tin
of
sardines
and
came
back
to
the
fire
with
it
in
her
hands
she
had
no
clear
conception
of
the
deed
when
half
of
the
fish
consumed
the
smelly
stuff
revolted
her
and
she
hurled
the
remaining
part
into
the
bed
of
coals
king
stamped
the
loose
snow
from
his
boots
and
came
in
gloria
stood
confronting
him
tense
rigid
her
hands
stiff
at
her
sides
she
wanted
to
cry
out
to
upbraid
him
all
of
her
fear
of
the
day
turned
into
molten
anger
but
at
the
moment
her
strength
failed
strangely
her
heart
seemed
to
be
stopping
she
choked
up
the
surge
of
her
relief
like
a
suddenly
released
current
impacting
with
that
other
current
of
her
unleashed
anger
made
of
her
consciousness
a
sort
of
wild
fuming
whirlpool
nothing
was
clear
to
her
just
then
save
that
mark
king
had
come
back
and
that
no
doubt
his
heart
was
filled
with
jeers
she
could
not
read
the
expression
of
his
shadowed
face
but
fancied
it
one
of
mockery
king
was
tired
throughout
every
muscle
of
his
body
he
set
down
his
rifle
tossed
his
hat
aside
and
slumped
down
by
the
fire
coming
in
from
the
open
he
sniffed
at
the
closeness
of
the
cave
it
was
not
alone
the
smell
of
smoke
his
first
thought
was
that
gloria
had
been
cooking
something
then
he
noted
the
with
a
stick
he
raked
it
out
of
the
coals
and
now
gloria
could
read
his
expression
well
enough
as
he
jerked
his
head
up
in
god
name
he
demanded
what
do
you
mean
by
a
thing
like
that
are
you
stark
raving
mad
for
a
moment
she
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
had
enraged
him
the
act
of
tossing
the
distasteful
food
into
the
fire
had
been
purely
involuntary
her
conscious
mind
had
hardly
taken
cognizance
of
the
fact
when
it
dawned
upon
her
what
he
meant
her
own
anger
was
still
greater
than
her
sense
of
her
act
folly
but
she
found
no
ready
answer
to
his
accusation
she
was
not
without
reason
in
their
present
predicament
she
was
a
fool
to
have
done
a
thing
like
that
she
could
hardly
believe
that
she
had
done
it
and
so
she
stared
impudently
at
him
and
held
her
silence
and
finally
with
an
elaborate
shrug
of
disdainful
shoulders
she
turned
her
back
on
him
but
king
flung
to
his
feet
and
set
his
hands
on
her
two
shoulders
and
swung
her
about
her
eyes
opened
widely
listen
to
me
he
said
angrily
i
am
going
to
talk
plain
to
you
you
are
a
fool
a
downright
silly
fool
what
you
have
destroyed
in
wanton
carelessness
would
have
kept
the
life
in
a
man
a
whole
day
have
you
sense
enough
to
see
it
going
to
be
nip
and
tuck
if
we
ever
get
out
of
this
you
shown
yourself
from
start
to
finish
a
miserable
cheat
there
no
trust
to
be
put
in
either
your
judgment
or
your
intentions
be
still
he
commanded
as
she
sought
to
wriggle
out
of
his
grasp
to
avoid
the
direct
blaze
of
his
eyes
i
am
going
to
do
what
i
can
for
you
to
see
you
safe
through
this
if
i
can
not
because
you
are
anything
to
me
but
just
because
you
are
ben
gaynor
and
he
is
my
friend
understand
you
are
hurting
me
she
said
in
defiance
take
your
dirty
hands
off
when
i
am
done
he
returned
curtly
i
am
going
to
stick
to
you
and
see
you
through
i
tell
you
but
i
am
not
going
to
have
you
throw
all
of
our
chances
away
by
dumping
grub
into
the
fire
if
you
do
one
other
brainless
thing
like
that
and
i
catch
you
at
it
i
am
going
to
tie
you
up
hand
and
foot
and
keep
you
out
of
mischief
you
would
dare
but
she
knew
better
he
would
dare
anything
he
of
the
type
that
fought
and
sailed
and
ruled
now
when
having
spoken
his
mind
he
turned
away
from
her
she
stared
after
him
and
watched
him
as
he
dropped
back
by
the
fire
then
she
went
slowly
to
her
bed
to
hide
her
trembling
and
lay
down
presently
she
heard
him
stirring
she
did
not
turn
her
head
to
look
at
him
but
she
knew
that
he
was
busied
with
supper
she
smelt
coffee
heard
the
clash
of
tin
cup
and
plate
and
realized
that
he
was
eating
she
wondered
if
he
had
forgotten
her
after
a
while
she
moved
just
a
trifle
and
furtively
he
had
put
away
his
dishes
and
was
filling
his
pipe
and
he
knew
that
she
was
watching
him
no
he
said
to
her
unspoken
question
i
am
not
going
to
cook
for
you
any
more
i
have
had
a
hard
day
of
it
doing
the
man
work
had
you
done
the
woman
you
would
have
had
supper
ready
for
me
he
lighted
his
pipe
with
a
splinter
of
burning
pine
then
for
the
first
time
he
saw
the
waste
of
scattered
matches
on
the
floor
from
them
he
looked
to
her
in
an
amazement
so
sheer
that
it
left
him
no
word
of
expostulation
the
suspicion
actually
came
to
him
that
the
girl
was
mad
it
was
scarcely
conceivable
that
a
perfectly
sane
individual
could
do
the
things
which
she
had
done
she
saw
him
get
up
and
begin
gathering
up
all
of
the
foodstuff
he
carried
it
to
the
back
of
the
cave
where
he
passed
out
of
her
sight
in
the
dark
he
was
gone
ten
minutes
and
came
back
he
made
the
second
trip
after
which
there
was
left
on
a
shelf
of
rock
only
half
a
dozen
matches
and
enough
food
for
one
scanty
meal
this
gloria
ignored
do
you
think
she
said
contemptuously
that
what
you
have
hidden
back
there
i
could
find
you
could
find
it
but
you
wo
he
returned
with
quiet
assurance
that
jerked
the
question
from
her
why
because
he
grunted
contemptuously
you
are
too
much
of
a
coward
to
go
back
there
to
look
for
it
and
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
here
was
but
the
mere
truth
for
why
was
she
not
already
in
gratton
camp
her
opportunity
had
come
and
gone
because
she
had
been
afraid
king
awoke
filled
with
resolve
and
definite
purpose
it
was
pitch
dark
but
he
sensed
the
coming
of
wintry
dawn
he
drew
on
his
boots
and
went
to
look
out
it
was
still
snowing
heavily
steadily
implacably
he
kicked
the
loose
fluffy
stuff
underfoot
the
biggest
storm
in
twenty
years
he
told
himself
and
if
any
one
of
us
in
these
mountains
come
out
of
them
alive
he
have
something
to
talk
about
it
the
real
thing
he
went
grimly
about
his
fixed
purpose
crystallizing
to
the
smallest
detail
again
he
must
seek
immediately
to
locate
his
horse
one
could
eat
horseflesh
if
driven
to
it
he
must
try
to
get
game
of
some
sort
and
every
lost
hour
meant
lessened
chances
of
his
killing
forest
meat
deer
and
bear
and
the
smaller
folk
if
they
had
been
caught
napping
would
be
scurrying
out
of
the
mountains
long
before
now
soon
the
solitudes
would
be
utterly
barren
and
empty
he
went
to
bed
you
better
get
up
he
said
briefly
time
to
start
the
day
while
we
eat
i
want
to
talk
with
you
she
awoke
slowly
blinked
at
him
and
only
drew
her
blanket
higher
about
her
chin
i
am
tired
she
answered
petulantly
do
you
realize
that
a
girl
i
realize
he
cut
into
her
sleepy
expostulation
that
you
are
weak
and
frightened
and
useless
and
that
those
are
three
of
the
many
things
you
got
to
get
over
the
shortest
way
if
you
do
want
to
die
here
i
do
know
that
i
care
to
live
she
began
turning
with
her
old
instinct
toward
an
attitude
which
before
now
had
robbed
him
of
his
harshness
but
his
plan
was
set
in
cold
determination
and
he
cut
her
short
again
if
you
do
care
i
do
and
i
am
going
to
pull
you
through
with
me
if
for
no
other
reason
simply
because
i
have
set
out
to
do
it
and
am
not
going
to
lie
down
on
the
job
what
more
you
got
to
do
your
share
i
have
built
the
fire
will
you
get
up
no
she
flashed
out
at
him
thoroughly
awake
now
i
wo
he
stooped
caught
the
corner
of
her
blankets
and
whipped
them
off
instinctively
she
sought
to
draw
the
over
her
forgetting
that
she
had
not
undressed
you
brute
she
screamed
at
him
get
up
he
told
her
sternly
or
by
heaven
i
make
you
she
saw
his
face
plainly
now
as
his
crackling
fire
burned
higher
it
was
hard
his
eyes
were
ominous
she
hesitated
and
saw
in
his
eyes
and
in
a
stir
of
his
body
that
he
was
going
to
jerk
her
to
her
feet
she
flung
out
of
bed
at
that
and
upon
the
far
side
from
him
get
your
boots
on
he
ordered
i
do
want
you
catching
cold
from
idiotic
carelessness
and
i
wo
have
you
going
sick
on
my
hands
for
the
first
and
last
time
i
admit
that
i
do
enjoy
driving
you
like
a
cursed
but
i
do
it
and
do
a
thorough
job
of
it
if
you
force
me
to
it
she
drew
on
her
boots
hastily
and
came
to
the
fire
and
laced
them
he
was
a
new
man
this
morning
and
relentless
she
was
afraid
of
him
after
a
new
bewildered
fashion
i
never
saw
a
storm
worse
than
this
he
told
her
he
had
cooked
the
breakfast
because
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
did
not
care
to
trust
her
wasteful
fingers
with
their
already
precious
food
there
must
be
two
or
three
feet
on
the
level
places
by
now
ploughing
through
snow
like
that
is
killing
work
for
a
man
and
you
would
last
at
it
ten
minutes
he
had
no
intention
of
speaking
contemptuously
she
knew
that
his
thought
was
not
trifling
with
such
matters
as
her
feelings
he
was
merely
indulging
in
plain
talk
we
have
enough
food
for
a
few
days
after
that
if
we
stuck
on
here
and
did
not
find
more
somehow
we
die
like
dogs
therefore
we
are
going
to
get
ready
to
beat
it
out
the
first
chance
we
get
but
if
i
would
last
ten
minutes
as
you
so
elegantly
put
it
not
as
you
are
not
as
the
snow
is
but
i
hoping
that
before
it
too
late
we
get
clear
weather
a
sun
a
thaw
and
freezing
nights
then
we
could
tackle
it
on
the
crust
and
your
job
now
is
to
get
yourself
ready
for
that
one
chance
her
anger
at
the
indignity
already
done
her
whipped
out
the
sarcasm
by
getting
ready
i
suppose
you
mean
for
me
to
pack
my
trunk
and
order
the
expressman
at
the
door
he
looked
at
her
with
a
long
impersonal
stare
which
bewildered
her
she
was
at
utter
loss
to
read
its
meaning
until
he
spoke
you
are
to
pack
what
endurance
you
got
into
your
muscles
you
are
to
make
up
your
mind
to
call
up
all
of
the
grit
that
in
you
you
need
both
and
you
are
to
quit
lying
around
and
getting
weaker
every
day
you
got
little
enough
time
to
harden
yourself
so
you
are
going
to
take
on
the
job
right
now
she
gasped
incredulous
he
nodded
sternly
gloria
he
said
tersely
i
am
going
to
do
all
that
i
can
for
both
of
us
you
are
going
to
do
all
that
you
can
that
is
final
she
bit
her
lips
and
gave
him
her
scornful
silence
the
blood
was
red
and
hot
in
her
cheeks
she
ignored
him
when
he
called
crisply
that
breakfast
was
ready
there
were
limits
to
her
obedience
she
thought
rebelliously
to
be
told
do
this
do
that
to
arise
when
this
man
body
was
rested
to
eat
when
his
stomach
was
empty
was
intolerable
king
looked
at
her
and
had
the
understanding
to
grasp
something
of
her
thought
so
he
explained
i
want
you
to
come
outside
with
me
you
find
it
hard
work
it
would
be
a
idea
if
you
fortify
your
strength
by
the
little
bit
of
nourishment
which
we
can
afford
to
take
no
well
i
here
he
offered
her
the
pieces
of
a
sack
he
had
cut
in
two
for
her
tie
those
about
your
feet
to
keep
them
from
freezing
when
i
want
your
advice
i
ask
for
it
she
retorted
icily
very
well
he
answered
and
i
ca
make
you
eat
if
you
do
want
to
after
all
perhaps
you
are
not
hungry
he
set
aside
her
portion
you
have
the
appetite
for
that
when
we
get
back
she
had
the
appetite
now
but
she
would
prefer
to
starve
she
honestly
thought
at
the
moment
than
eat
when
he
told
her
to
eat
now
he
finished
in
silence
she
saw
him
glance
at
his
watch
her
heart
seemed
scarcely
to
stir
in
her
breast
then
slowly
it
began
to
beat
swifter
and
swifter
hammering
wildly
he
had
said
that
she
was
going
out
with
him
what
he
promised
to
do
she
realized
again
he
would
do
if
it
were
humanly
possible
she
wanted
to
run
run
anywhere
just
to
be
lost
to
him
and
yet
she
stood
and
rigid
while
her
heart
hastened
and
leaped
and
her
mind
sought
to
grasp
the
thing
to
do
she
must
go
with
him
do
what
he
told
her
like
a
slave
as
he
had
said
or
he
would
make
her
her
reason
said
directly
you
will
go
without
a
word
and
yet
when
he
arose
to
his
feet
and
knocked
his
pipe
out
and
looked
at
her
her
reason
fled
before
the
flood
of
the
passionate
wilfulness
of
the
old
gloria
and
she
cried
shrilly
i
wo
i
wo
i
am
not
your
slave
and
i
am
not
going
to
jump
at
your
bidding
you
ca
make
me
you
sha
make
me
wo
he
had
hoped
for
better
than
this
he
came
closer
and
looked
intently
into
her
eyes
seeking
to
measure
what
endurance
and
steadfastness
and
stubbornness
were
hers
but
her
eyes
showed
him
only
glimpses
of
a
soul
i
will
make
you
he
said
harshly
so
help
me
god
gloria
i
will
make
you
and
i
am
through
talking
i
am
sick
of
talk
come
with
me
she
drew
back
and
back
in
fury
you
do
listen
to
me
we
are
down
to
bare
elementals
now
ca
you
see
it
it
is
no
question
of
what
we
like
to
do
or
dislike
it
is
a
question
of
life
and
death
if
to
let
you
have
your
way
were
anything
other
than
suicide
i
let
you
have
it
if
i
thought
that
you
would
listen
to
reason
i
stop
to
reason
with
you
but
as
things
are
i
got
nothing
left
me
but
tell
you
what
to
do
and
you
got
to
do
as
i
say
my
life
is
my
own
to
do
with
it
as
i
please
i
do
not
please
to
obey
your
commands
her
tortured
heart
surged
up
in
wild
triumph
as
he
turned
it
sank
sickly
as
he
came
back
he
had
a
piece
of
rope
in
his
hand
the
heavy
rope
which
had
served
to
tie
a
horse
you
would
tie
me
she
gasped
me
no
he
said
tersely
as
though
you
were
any
other
fractious
animal
refusing
discipline
when
refusal
means
death
i
am
going
to
whip
you
god
screamed
gloria
oh
my
god
for
again
he
but
said
simply
the
thing
which
he
meant
to
do
and
she
knew
yet
the
consummation
was
monstrous
unthinkable
she
would
not
believe
it
at
the
last
minute
his
lifted
arm
would
fail
him
god
himself
would
wither
it
undreamed
rescuers
would
come
the
earth
would
open
would
save
her
from
this
humiliation
which
would
kill
her
while
i
count
three
said
king
and
steadily
though
there
was
a
pallor
on
his
own
face
which
should
have
told
her
the
terrible
relentlessness
of
his
intention
he
counted
one
two
three
she
put
her
face
into
her
hands
and
shivered
and
felt
the
fear
of
one
under
the
flashing
guillotine
she
willed
to
move
to
obey
at
this
tardy
second
but
something
within
her
stronger
than
herself
held
her
back
wo
she
screamed
the
blow
fell
swiftly
the
rope
cut
through
the
air
with
vicious
sibilance
and
fell
across
the
stooped
shoulders
the
pain
was
immediate
hot
and
searing
and
gloria
shrieked
once
only
and
grew
still
she
dropped
her
hands
and
looked
at
him
her
face
as
white
as
a
dead
girl
her
eyes
as
unfathomable
as
a
maniac
she
who
had
never
been
whipped
in
all
of
her
life
she
whose
soft
white
body
had
been
held
inviolate
by
idolizing
parents
she
who
had
come
to
hold
her
own
person
as
sacred
as
that
of
a
high
princess
to
be
beaten
by
a
man
to
be
lashed
across
her
shoulders
with
a
she
gloria
gaynor
to
have
her
bedding
ripped
off
her
to
be
commanded
to
do
a
man
bidding
and
to
be
whipped
she
had
known
fear
blind
paralysing
terror
she
had
suffered
indignity
and
experienced
an
insulted
resentment
that
seared
through
her
like
a
hot
iron
she
had
known
pain
merciless
bodily
pain
now
she
was
plunged
into
stupor
but
that
stupor
was
of
only
the
fraction
of
a
second
in
duration
a
flash
as
of
white
fire
flared
through
her
brain
in
a
soul
in
torment
something
had
happened
something
had
been
killed
within
her
or
something
had
been
born
a
blow
at
a
man
hand
had
seemed
to
cut
through
her
being
it
had
separated
body
and
spirit
she
was
conscious
of
the
body
as
though
she
stood
apart
and
looked
down
at
it
he
could
beat
that
he
was
stronger
the
spirit
rose
above
it
a
spirit
bathed
in
floods
of
fire
she
was
in
the
sudden
fierce
grip
of
such
anger
as
kills
of
such
defiance
as
suffers
death
and
does
not
yield
i
wo
go
with
you
she
cried
you
may
beat
me
you
may
kill
me
if
you
like
unthinkable
brute
that
you
are
i
will
not
follow
you
now
i
will
never
follow
one
step
ever
i
have
listened
to
you
now
listen
to
me
i
would
rather
die
than
be
brought
to
safety
by
you
if
i
can
not
find
the
way
home
without
your
help
i
do
not
want
ever
to
get
home
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
or
your
rope
i
had
rather
feel
a
clean
rope
across
my
shoulders
until
they
were
bloody
than
your
vile
hand
on
mine
you
will
do
what
i
tell
you
to
do
he
said
thickly
it
is
the
only
way
i
will
make
you
blazing
eyes
burning
in
a
face
gave
him
his
only
answer
his
own
face
now
was
no
less
white
as
he
was
he
was
trembling
yet
he
lifted
the
rope
to
strike
the
second
blow
not
just
to
frighten
her
but
to
strike
she
read
his
purpose
clearly
and
she
could
not
restrain
a
shudder
of
her
flesh
but
she
did
not
draw
back
from
him
and
she
did
not
cry
out
she
meant
what
she
had
said
or
what
some
gloria
had
said
for
her
he
might
kill
her
but
she
would
not
follow
him
and
then
mark
king
as
he
was
about
to
strike
stayed
his
hand
at
the
last
moment
and
hurled
the
rope
far
from
him
and
whirled
about
and
left
her
someway
he
came
to
the
base
of
the
cliffs
he
was
outside
he
was
in
the
open
and
yet
he
struggled
blindly
through
a
pit
of
gloom
he
was
conscious
of
but
one
fact
in
all
the
world
about
it
everything
else
turned
and
spun
as
sweep
the
bodies
of
the
sky
about
the
sun
he
had
lifted
his
hand
against
a
woman
he
mark
king
had
struck
a
woman
he
had
struck
gloria
his
friend
daughter
ben
daughter
he
had
struck
her
what
had
come
over
him
had
he
gone
mad
stark
staring
raving
mad
he
knew
all
along
that
his
nerves
were
on
edge
raw
and
quivering
but
no
jangling
nerves
explained
a
thing
like
that
he
who
had
held
himself
a
man
had
struck
a
woman
a
girl
a
little
defenceless
girl
my
god
he
groaned
he
stumbled
on
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
going
or
why
he
ran
his
hand
across
his
eyes
again
and
again
he
did
know
why
he
did
that
one
could
thus
wipe
out
a
vision
which
persisted
in
his
brain
see
her
as
she
stood
there
every
day
and
night
until
he
died
in
a
sweeping
revulsion
of
feeling
he
saw
himself
all
that
she
had
named
him
a
great
hulking
brute
all
along
he
had
been
brutal
with
her
he
should
have
made
due
allowances
he
should
have
been
patient
he
had
plunged
her
into
an
existence
of
which
she
had
no
foreknowledge
he
had
looked
to
her
for
the
sober
sanity
of
maturity
when
he
should
have
remembered
how
young
she
was
how
little
of
real
life
she
knew
how
she
had
been
driven
to
desperation
by
circumstances
which
crushed
her
how
she
had
gone
sleepless
living
on
her
nerves
he
had
held
her
weak
and
worthless
and
without
spirit
or
character
and
now
he
could
only
see
her
standing
up
before
him
white
but
valiant
defying
him
unafraid
welcoming
death
rather
than
yield
to
him
he
would
have
given
ten
years
off
the
span
of
his
life
to
have
the
deed
of
one
mad
moment
wiped
clean
it
was
a
long
time
before
consecutive
thought
returned
to
him
and
it
brought
him
only
increased
bitterness
gloria
had
said
that
she
would
die
here
rather
than
have
him
lead
her
to
safety
well
he
did
not
blame
her
for
that
rather
he
told
himself
grimly
he
honoured
her
for
it
and
yet
now
more
than
ever
his
and
his
alone
was
the
responsibility
of
seeing
that
she
went
clear
of
this
wretched
existence
into
which
he
had
stubbornly
led
her
he
could
not
take
her
away
against
her
will
he
could
not
pick
her
up
in
his
arms
and
carry
her
over
a
two
or
three
days
journey
nor
could
he
entrust
her
to
the
only
other
human
beings
who
were
near
enough
for
her
to
go
to
what
could
he
do
she
would
perish
without
help
hence
he
must
help
her
but
how
there
was
but
one
possible
answer
and
in
due
course
of
time
he
came
to
see
it
clearly
he
must
leave
her
get
back
the
shortest
quickest
way
to
civilization
and
send
other
men
trustworthy
men
in
for
her
it
could
be
done
even
though
the
storm
continued
he
could
get
a
alaskan
huskies
to
be
had
in
truckee
he
could
load
sledges
with
provisions
he
could
put
the
right
man
in
charge
and
then
lead
the
way
that
would
mean
several
days
alone
for
gloria
but
what
else
was
there
and
even
that
solution
depended
upon
the
consideration
which
by
now
was
the
elemental
thing
first
he
must
find
some
sort
of
provisions
with
which
to
eke
out
their
small
supply
there
was
not
enough
in
camp
to
sustain
him
while
he
battled
with
the
storm
for
a
way
out
and
to
sustain
strength
in
her
while
she
waited
he
must
first
replenish
the
larder
otherwise
they
died
he
must
get
fish
in
plenty
or
a
bear
or
a
deer
he
looked
at
the
grey
ominous
sky
at
the
piling
snow
and
the
chill
of
the
wilderness
struck
to
his
heart
but
at
last
his
eyes
grew
hard
again
with
determination
in
a
distressed
mental
condition
in
which
the
only
solid
ground
beneath
him
was
his
determination
to
do
to
the
uttermost
that
lay
within
him
for
gloria
he
broke
into
mutterings
voicing
aloud
fragments
of
speech
forcing
himself
toward
steadiness
of
purpose
i
got
to
leave
her
she
wo
go
with
me
that
means
i
got
to
leave
with
her
every
scrap
of
food
we
have
between
us
i
can
go
two
days
without
eating
i
can
a
man
if
he
half
a
man
can
finish
his
work
before
he
buckles
under
her
one
danger
is
brodie
otherwise
she
would
be
safe
enough
for
four
or
five
days
she
got
to
stick
close
to
the
cave
she
must
not
dare
to
set
foot
outside
but
that
not
enough
they
might
come
to
the
cave
the
way
in
is
not
overwide
would
they
see
it
from
below
they
do
know
where
it
is
or
they
would
have
done
as
i
did
they
would
have
come
to
it
for
shelter
no
they
do
know
of
it
can
i
close
up
the
entrance
somehow
so
that
they
wo
find
it
there
are
loose
rocks
in
there
if
they
come
this
way
up
the
gorge
it
will
be
hard
for
them
to
see
it
from
below
even
if
they
should
find
it
i
can
show
her
where
to
hide
way
in
the
back
there
a
place
there
i
can
get
out
in
two
days
back
in
two
days
somehow
allow
five
days
to
cover
accidents
five
days
she
can
stick
it
out
five
days
if
i
do
take
a
scrap
of
her
food
away
from
her
oh
i
can
make
it
it
is
up
to
me
to
make
it
i
get
a
fish
sooner
or
later
or
a
rabbit
a
man
can
eat
his
boots
after
a
long
time
he
went
back
to
the
cave
he
knew
now
just
what
he
would
do
since
it
had
become
clear
to
him
that
there
was
but
one
thing
to
be
done
gloria
faced
him
as
he
came
in
she
marked
how
he
walked
like
a
very
tired
man
her
head
was
up
there
were
spots
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
in
her
eyes
was
a
new
look
she
had
found
herself
or
she
was
finding
herself
her
spirit
had
risen
undaunted
in
a
crisis
in
a
clash
of
wills
hers
had
not
gone
down
before
his
rather
it
had
been
hers
that
had
triumphed
she
might
know
fear
again
but
the
time
was
past
and
dead
when
she
would
bow
meekly
before
a
man
bidding
so
she
told
herself
while
with
head
erect
she
awaited
his
speech
he
began
saying
very
simply
what
he
had
decided
must
be
said
he
did
not
swerve
for
the
useless
words
i
am
sorry
he
knew
that
she
did
not
expect
them
would
not
answer
them
what
he
had
done
was
monstrous
and
unpardonable
hence
a
man
would
not
ask
pardon
by
his
own
act
they
were
set
as
far
apart
as
two
beings
inhabiting
two
widely
separate
worlds
it
remained
for
him
merely
to
instruct
her
concerning
what
she
must
do
then
to
find
the
way
to
bring
her
back
safely
to
her
father
thereafter
there
the
haze
crept
in
again
he
would
go
away
far
from
the
sierra
far
from
california
to
some
corner
of
the
world
where
no
man
who
had
ever
known
mark
king
would
see
him
again
at
that
moment
he
could
have
died
very
gladly
just
to
know
that
she
was
once
more
among
her
own
people
and
that
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
life
was
a
game
played
out
and
ended
now
that
he
spoke
again
his
voice
was
no
longer
harsh
and
stern
but
gentle
rather
gentle
after
a
steady
and
fashion
that
was
infinitely
aloof
he
could
not
know
how
impersonal
his
utterance
sounded
in
her
ears
since
he
did
not
fully
realize
how
at
the
moment
he
held
himself
less
an
individual
addressing
another
than
as
the
mouthpiece
of
fate
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
he
told
her
i
am
going
over
the
ridge
and
to
the
headwaters
of
the
other
fork
i
have
been
thinking
of
that
country
a
good
deal
it
a
little
far
and
hard
going
and
i
burn
up
a
lot
of
fuel
making
the
trip
but
i
got
a
hunch
a
bear
in
there
the
one
that
stampeded
buck
may
have
circled
around
that
way
and
i
going
to
play
every
hunch
i
get
good
and
strong
it
will
probably
be
dark
before
i
get
back
she
thought
that
he
had
finished
but
presently
in
the
same
strangely
quiet
voice
he
continued
i
may
even
be
gone
all
night
if
i
am
it
will
be
because
i
am
playing
the
last
card
you
have
said
that
you
would
rather
be
dead
than
go
with
me
i
believe
you
meant
that
again
he
paused
gloria
did
not
again
lift
her
eyes
from
the
fire
did
not
speak
king
sighed
and
did
not
know
that
he
had
done
so
if
i
do
get
back
night
it
will
be
because
i
am
trying
to
break
through
to
civilization
i
outfit
a
party
and
send
them
in
for
you
i
get
through
some
way
in
two
days
i
get
help
back
to
you
in
another
two
or
three
at
latest
you
have
food
here
to
keep
you
alive
a
week
if
you
spin
it
out
long
before
he
had
gotten
to
the
end
of
his
slow
speech
her
heart
was
beating
wildly
the
old
fears
surged
back
on
her
crushing
her
to
be
left
here
alone
four
or
five
days
and
nights
it
was
unendurable
she
would
be
dead
you
have
your
choice
he
went
on
his
voice
grown
still
more
gentle
if
you
will
let
me
help
you
but
even
while
in
the
silence
that
followed
she
heard
the
rapid
beating
of
her
own
heart
something
stronger
more
stubborn
than
the
gloria
of
another
day
kept
her
silent
and
still
he
had
not
finished
before
i
go
i
am
going
to
do
all
that
i
can
to
wall
up
the
mouth
of
the
cave
it
will
make
it
warmer
in
here
and
and
there
will
be
less
danger
of
any
one
finding
the
place
you
threatened
once
to
go
to
those
other
men
matter
what
happens
you
must
not
do
you
do
quite
understand
what
some
men
are
these
happen
to
be
the
worst
of
a
bad
crowd
that
ever
got
into
these
mountains
they
respect
neither
god
nor
man
nor
woman
they
are
in
an
ugly
mood
they
probably
have
more
bootleg
whiskey
with
them
than
food
i
did
not
tell
you
but
i
looked
in
on
their
camp
and
saw
one
of
them
a
dope
fiend
named
benny
rudge
shoot
one
of
his
own
friends
dead
suspecting
him
of
having
stolen
a
side
of
bacon
you
would
be
better
dead
too
than
in
their
hands
never
forget
that
they
do
know
if
they
ever
get
out
of
this
alive
they
are
desperate
devils
but
with
the
cave
walled
up
they
wo
find
you
if
the
worst
should
happen
and
they
came
here
still
you
could
hide
i
show
you
the
place
far
back
in
the
cave
you
could
run
there
with
your
blankets
and
food
you
could
stay
there
never
moving
no
man
could
find
you
there
they
would
see
where
we
had
been
here
but
they
would
have
to
decide
in
the
end
that
we
had
gone
both
of
us
i
bring
you
plenty
of
wood
i
am
going
to
make
a
pair
of
of
a
sort
for
me
i
make
a
pair
for
you
i
hope
you
wo
need
them
he
ran
his
hand
across
his
brow
but
continued
in
a
moment
his
voice
unchanged
i
go
out
before
daylight
in
the
morning
it
will
take
me
all
that
is
left
of
to
do
what
must
be
done
first
he
turned
then
and
went
about
his
work
she
went
back
to
the
place
by
the
fire
terribly
moved
agitated
to
the
depths
of
her
soul
torn
this
way
and
that
but
one
steady
fire
burned
in
her
bosom
the
newly
kindled
white
flame
of
her
resentment
just
yonder
where
he
had
hurled
it
a
grim
reminder
lay
the
rope
he
brought
fragments
of
rock
to
the
cave
mouth
the
biggest
he
could
find
boulders
which
he
rolled
from
the
further
dark
and
with
which
he
struggled
mightily
as
he
piled
them
one
on
the
other
higher
and
higher
he
built
his
rude
wall
placing
the
smaller
stones
at
the
top
and
in
time
after
hours
of
labour
he
had
hidden
the
great
hole
as
best
he
could
leaving
only
at
the
side
a
way
to
pass
in
and
out
which
could
hardly
be
seen
from
below
across
this
he
fixed
the
canvas
were
that
glimpsed
its
would
appear
but
a
streak
of
granite
if
you
will
come
with
me
i
will
show
you
your
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
him
no
word
had
passed
between
them
during
the
hours
of
his
labouring
again
she
thought
swiftly
he
was
seeking
to
command
to
dictate
doubtless
in
the
end
she
would
have
arisen
and
gone
with
him
since
to
refuse
were
madness
but
he
had
not
waited
he
had
gone
alone
into
the
depths
of
the
cavern
she
heard
his
slow
measured
steps
receding
she
heard
them
again
slow
and
measured
as
he
came
back
it
only
about
thirty
paces
straight
back
he
was
saying
my
steps
remember
but
shortened
so
that
it
would
be
about
the
same
for
you
say
there
i
have
made
a
little
pile
of
rocks
you
ca
miss
it
that
marks
the
place
just
at
the
side
of
the
rock
pile
where
i
found
the
gold
there
is
a
blind
cave
back
there
just
under
this
one
there
only
a
small
entrance
to
it
straight
down
a
ragged
hole
in
the
floor
hardly
more
than
big
enough
for
a
man
to
drop
down
through
i
had
it
hidden
by
dragging
a
boulder
over
it
now
i
have
shoved
the
boulder
just
far
enough
to
one
side
to
let
you
go
through
also
i
have
set
bits
of
stone
under
its
outside
edge
so
that
it
is
fairly
balanced
if
you
go
through
a
quick
tug
at
it
will
topple
it
over
to
cover
the
hole
again
there
air
down
there
that
comes
up
from
below
and
it
a
better
place
to
be
than
here
if
any
one
should
come
she
shuddered
but
he
had
not
seen
there
remained
much
to
do
and
the
hours
fled
so
swiftly
he
set
to
work
making
the
clumsy
he
imitated
a
crude
native
shoe
he
had
once
seen
in
alaska
he
bent
willow
wands
he
had
brought
from
along
the
edge
of
the
stream
whipping
them
about
with
narrow
strips
of
canvas
binding
other
wands
crosswise
making
also
of
canvas
strips
a
sort
of
stirrup
for
each
foot
the
last
of
the
weak
daylight
passed
and
died
gloomily
and
he
was
still
at
his
task
bending
now
by
his
fire
working
on
with
infinite
care
the
sticks
brittle
with
the
cold
weather
broke
under
his
strong
fingers
patiently
he
inserted
others
or
strengthened
the
cracking
pieces
with
string
his
face
ruddy
in
the
firelight
was
impassive
gloria
looking
at
him
saw
no
mere
man
but
a
senseless
thing
of
machine
levers
and
steel
coils
something
tireless
and
hard
and
as
determined
as
fate
itself
they
had
made
their
scanty
suppers
after
it
both
were
hungry
they
had
been
hungry
thus
for
four
days
there
remained
coffee
and
sugar
enough
for
another
meagre
meals
here
the
affluence
ended
the
bacon
was
down
to
a
piece
of
fat
two
inches
thick
and
seven
inches
long
there
was
bacon
grease
a
couple
of
inches
deep
in
a
there
was
a
teacup
of
flour
there
was
one
small
tin
of
sardines
and
a
smaller
one
of
devilled
meat
they
were
hungry
they
would
be
a
great
deal
hungrier
the
next
day
they
would
begin
to
starve
king
got
up
and
went
out
down
the
cliffs
in
the
dark
for
a
last
load
of
wood
when
he
came
back
she
was
lying
on
her
bed
her
face
from
the
light
he
stood
a
moment
looking
at
her
then
for
the
last
time
he
spoke
to
her
if
i
am
long
gone
you
understand
why
it
would
be
best
to
save
food
all
you
can
not
to
stir
about
much
since
exercise
means
burning
up
more
strength
which
must
be
renewed
and
by
still
more
food
there
is
not
a
chance
in
a
thousand
now
that
those
men
will
find
this
place
if
they
do
there
is
not
a
chance
in
another
thousand
that
they
will
find
the
middle
cave
you
will
be
safe
enough
and
if
i
do
not
get
back
you
will
know
that
within
three
days
more
or
four
at
most
there
will
be
a
party
in
here
to
bring
you
out
gloria
awoke
with
a
start
she
had
not
heard
king
go
yet
she
knew
that
she
was
alone
in
the
cave
alone
she
sat
up
clutching
her
blankets
about
her
objects
all
around
her
were
plunged
into
darkness
but
where
the
canvas
let
in
the
morning
she
saw
a
patch
of
drear
chill
light
full
morning
then
by
now
mark
king
was
far
away
oh
the
pitiless
loneliness
of
the
world
as
she
sat
there
in
the
gloom
of
the
cavern
her
heart
as
cheerless
as
the
drear
light
creeping
in
as
cold
as
the
dead
charred
sticks
where
last
night
fire
had
burnt
itself
out
and
oh
the
terrible
merciless
silence
about
her
she
sat
plunged
into
a
despondency
beyond
the
bourne
of
tears
a
slim
girl
crushed
beaten
by
a
relentless
destiny
lost
to
the
world
shut
in
between
two
terrors
the
black
unknown
of
the
deeper
cavern
the
white
menace
of
a
waste
wilderness
and
far
more
than
pinch
of
cold
or
bite
of
hunger
was
her
utter
solitude
unbearable
she
sprang
up
and
built
a
fire
less
for
the
warmth
though
she
was
cold
to
the
bone
than
for
the
sense
of
companionship
the
homely
flames
were
like
flames
in
remembered
fireplaces
their
voices
were
as
the
voices
of
those
other
fires
their
light
though
showing
only
cold
rock
walls
and
rude
camp
equipment
was
the
closest
thing
she
had
to
companionship
she
came
close
to
the
fire
and
for
a
long
time
would
not
move
from
it
she
went
to
the
wall
king
had
built
moving
the
canvas
aside
just
enough
to
look
out
and
stood
there
a
long
time
a
dead
hush
lay
over
the
world
there
was
no
wind
the
snow
in
great
unbroken
feathery
crystals
fell
softly
thick
in
the
sky
dropping
ceaselessly
and
soundlessly
it
clung
to
the
limbs
of
trees
making
of
each
branch
a
thick
white
arm
stilling
the
binding
them
together
in
the
sheath
which
forbade
them
to
shiver
and
rustle
it
lay
in
sludgy
messes
in
the
pools
of
the
stream
and
curled
over
the
edges
of
the
steep
banks
and
coated
the
boulders
it
lay
its
white
command
for
silence
upon
the
racing
water
a
world
and
that
unbroken
silence
which
exists
nowhere
else
as
it
does
in
the
wastes
of
snow
and
which
lies
upon
the
soul
like
a
positive
inhibition
against
the
slightest
sound
no
wind
to
stir
a
dry
twig
no
dry
twig
but
was
manacled
and
muffled
no
dead
leaves
to
rustle
since
all
dead
leaves
lay
deeper
than
death
under
the
snow
gloria
sensation
as
she
stood
as
still
as
the
wilderness
all
about
her
and
stared
out
across
the
ridges
was
that
of
one
who
had
suddenly
and
without
warning
gone
the
stillness
was
so
absolute
that
it
seemed
to
crush
the
soul
within
her
she
went
back
hastily
to
her
fire
glad
to
hear
the
crackle
of
the
flames
grateful
to
have
the
emptiness
made
somewhat
less
the
yawning
void
by
the
small
sound
of
a
bit
of
wood
rolling
apart
on
the
rock
floor
she
was
hungry
but
she
had
no
heart
for
cooking
she
ate
little
scraps
of
cold
food
left
over
from
last
night
she
nibbled
at
a
last
bit
of
the
slab
chocolate
she
filled
a
pot
with
snow
gathered
at
the
cave
mouth
and
set
it
on
the
coals
to
get
water
to
drink
and
again
having
nothing
else
to
do
and
urged
restlessly
to
some
form
of
activity
she
hurried
back
to
the
canvas
flap
and
watched
the
falling
snow
hearkening
to
the
stillness
for
in
the
spell
of
the
snow
country
one
is
forced
to
the
attitude
of
one
who
listens
and
who
hears
the
great
hush
and
who
like
the
enchanted
world
about
it
heeds
and
obeys
and
when
he
moves
goes
with
quiet
footfalls
endlessly
long
were
the
minutes
hours
were
eternities
she
stood
by
the
rock
wall
until
she
was
chilled
as
noiselessly
as
a
creeping
shadow
she
went
back
to
her
fire
and
shivered
before
it
and
warmed
herself
turning
her
head
quickly
to
peer
into
the
dark
of
the
hidden
tunnel
turning
again
as
quickly
to
glance
toward
her
rude
door
her
heart
leaping
at
every
crackle
of
her
fire
she
thawed
some
of
the
cold
out
of
her
and
went
to
look
out
again
a
hundred
times
she
made
the
brief
journey
from
being
thought
became
a
laborious
drugged
process
her
excited
mind
had
harboured
throngs
of
vivid
visions
she
had
known
a
period
of
mental
stimulation
she
had
seen
as
in
the
actual
flesh
mark
king
ploughing
through
the
snow
going
over
ridges
pushing
on
and
on
and
on
always
further
away
driving
on
through
limitless
distances
she
had
seen
him
fall
his
body
crashing
down
a
sheer
precipice
she
had
seen
him
lying
his
face
turned
up
the
snowflakes
falling
falling
falling
covering
it
she
had
seen
him
going
on
again
she
had
seen
him
breaking
his
way
to
the
open
getting
back
among
other
men
falling
exhausted
but
calling
upon
them
to
go
back
to
her
she
had
seen
men
hurrying
harnessed
packs
of
provisions
men
on
she
had
seen
them
coming
toward
her
across
the
miles
some
one
else
was
coming
too
it
was
big
swen
brodie
his
face
horrible
there
was
a
rabble
at
his
back
it
was
a
race
between
these
men
and
those
other
men
she
had
felt
that
brodie
was
putting
out
a
terrible
hand
toward
her
she
had
seen
other
men
leap
upon
him
dragging
him
back
king
had
returned
king
and
brodie
were
struggling
then
again
she
saw
king
fighting
his
way
through
the
snow
going
for
help
she
had
tried
to
reason
he
could
be
only
a
few
miles
away
but
at
last
a
tired
brain
refused
to
create
more
of
these
swift
pictures
she
stared
out
and
did
not
think
she
merely
felt
the
weight
of
the
silence
the
weight
of
utter
loneliness
with
dragging
feet
she
returned
to
her
fire
and
looked
into
the
coals
and
from
them
to
the
further
dark
and
from
it
back
to
the
pale
light
about
her
canvas
she
sank
into
a
condition
of
lethargy
the
silence
had
worked
a
sort
of
hypnosis
in
her
briefly
in
her
eyes
there
was
no
light
of
interest
vaguely
as
though
she
had
no
great
personal
concern
in
the
matter
she
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
one
left
alone
here
would
go
mad
and
would
the
mad
one
shout
shrieking
defiance
at
the
silence
or
go
about
on
finger
laid
across
his
lips
the
morning
wore
on
at
one
moment
she
was
plunged
into
a
deep
chaotic
abyss
that
was
neither
unconsciousness
nor
reverie
and
yet
which
strangely
partook
of
both
a
moment
later
she
was
vaguely
aware
of
a
difference
it
was
as
though
a
presence
though
what
sort
she
could
not
tell
had
approached
were
near
her
all
about
her
that
instant
of
uncertainty
was
brief
gone
in
a
flash
she
turned
and
a
little
glad
cry
broke
from
her
lips
a
streak
of
sunshine
lay
across
the
rocks
at
the
cave
mouth
it
was
like
the
visit
of
an
angel
more
than
that
like
the
face
of
a
beloved
friend
she
ran
to
her
canvas
and
looked
out
there
was
a
rift
in
the
sombre
roofing
of
clouds
she
saw
a
strip
of
clean
blue
sky
through
which
a
splendid
sun
shone
and
yet
the
snow
was
falling
on
all
hands
snow
bright
with
a
new
shining
whiteness
she
watched
that
little
strip
of
heaven
blue
eagerly
and
anxiously
was
it
widening
or
were
the
clouds
crowding
over
it
again
but
though
this
seemed
the
one
consideration
of
importance
in
all
the
world
for
her
just
now
in
another
instant
it
was
swept
from
her
mind
forgotten
far
below
her
down
in
the
gorge
she
saw
something
moving
and
that
something
ploughing
laboriously
through
depths
and
drifts
of
loose
fluffy
snow
was
a
man
now
her
thoughts
raced
again
it
was
king
he
was
coming
back
to
her
no
it
was
not
king
it
was
swen
brodie
she
began
to
tremble
violently
she
had
barely
strength
to
draw
back
to
pull
the
canvas
closer
to
the
rocks
to
strive
to
hide
if
brodie
came
now
if
brodie
found
her
here
alone
that
fear
which
is
in
all
female
hearts
that
boundless
terror
of
the
one
creature
who
is
her
greatest
protector
her
vilest
enemy
more
dreaded
than
a
wild
beast
gripped
her
and
shook
her
and
swiftly
beat
the
strength
out
of
her
but
fascinated
she
clung
to
the
rocks
and
watched
the
man
struggling
weakly
against
the
pitiless
wilderness
wallowing
in
the
snow
seemed
to
make
his
way
along
the
gorge
inch
by
inch
he
carried
something
on
his
back
something
white
under
the
falling
snow
which
whitened
his
hat
and
labouring
shoulders
a
sack
with
something
in
it
something
to
which
he
clung
tenaciously
how
he
floundered
and
battled
against
the
white
stuff
about
him
which
held
him
back
which
mounted
about
his
legs
up
to
his
waist
at
times
when
he
floundered
he
was
all
but
lost
in
it
he
lay
still
like
a
dead
man
he
struggled
and
began
crawling
on
again
he
stopped
and
looked
about
him
how
her
heart
pounded
then
he
was
looking
for
something
seeking
something
her
she
was
so
certain
it
must
be
brodie
yet
she
remained
motionless
powerless
to
move
though
she
remembered
king
word
of
the
where
she
would
be
safe
she
peered
out
fascinated
in
time
the
man
came
closer
and
the
first
suspicion
entered
her
mind
that
after
all
it
might
not
be
brodie
he
stopped
he
was
exhausted
he
pulled
off
his
hat
and
ran
his
hand
across
his
face
then
still
bareheaded
he
looked
up
it
was
gratton
gratton
alone
gratton
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
more
often
than
he
quested
far
ahead
gratton
in
a
mad
attempt
to
make
haste
where
haste
was
impossible
now
his
every
gesture
bespoke
a
frantic
haste
he
was
escaping
from
something
then
what
he
had
left
the
other
men
he
was
running
away
from
them
she
knew
it
as
well
as
if
he
had
screamed
it
into
her
ears
a
sudden
spurt
of
pity
for
him
entered
her
heart
he
seemed
so
beaten
and
bewildered
and
frantic
and
terrified
who
better
than
she
could
sympathize
with
one
in
gratton
predicament
she
looked
far
down
the
gorge
she
could
see
like
a
bluish
crooked
shadow
the
trail
which
he
had
made
after
him
no
one
else
in
sight
then
she
forgot
everything
saving
that
she
and
gratton
were
alone
that
they
had
been
friends
that
they
were
bound
in
a
common
fate
she
leaned
as
far
out
as
she
could
he
was
just
below
now
she
called
to
him
he
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
he
jerked
his
head
up
and
stared
wildly
his
mouth
dropped
open
and
in
the
shock
of
the
moment
speech
was
denied
him
she
called
again
you
had
not
the
silence
been
so
complete
his
gasping
voice
would
have
failed
to
reach
her
as
it
was
she
barely
heard
it
you
gloria
here
my
god
have
i
gone
mad
the
man
villainy
of
so
few
days
ago
appeared
now
in
the
biassed
light
of
circumstance
a
pardonable
a
forgettable
offence
he
had
loved
her
he
had
wanted
to
marry
her
he
had
with
that
in
mind
tricked
her
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
universal
admission
that
in
love
as
in
war
all
things
were
fair
the
ugliness
of
what
he
had
done
was
chiefly
ugly
because
it
had
lain
against
a
background
of
commonplace
and
convention
here
at
the
time
when
no
considerations
existed
save
the
eternal
and
vital
ones
all
of
gratton
futile
trickery
was
as
though
it
had
never
been
she
was
calling
to
him
again
urging
him
to
clamber
up
the
cliff
bidding
him
hurry
before
he
was
seen
how
came
you
here
was
all
that
he
could
find
words
for
you
and
she
would
tell
him
everything
but
he
must
not
tarry
down
there
he
must
make
haste
her
words
cleared
his
bewilderment
away
he
glanced
again
over
his
shoulder
the
gorge
was
empty
of
other
human
presence
he
looked
back
up
at
her
and
then
before
her
eager
eyes
he
slumped
down
where
he
stood
lying
in
the
snow
i
ca
she
heard
his
voice
as
across
a
distance
ten
times
that
which
separated
them
in
it
was
bleak
despair
i
gone
through
hell
already
i
am
nearly
dead
i
could
climb
up
there
i
oh
my
god
why
did
i
ever
come
into
this
inferno
she
begged
she
urged
but
he
only
turned
a
white
face
up
to
her
and
lay
where
he
had
fallen
his
body
shaking
visibly
what
with
the
strain
he
had
put
upon
it
and
the
emotions
which
only
his
own
soul
knew
but
it
is
so
easy
she
cried
to
him
forgetful
of
her
now
terror
at
mounting
up
here
i
have
done
it
twice
i
will
show
you
just
which
way
where
to
set
your
feet
i
ca
he
said
miserably
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
get
this
far
i
i
think
i
am
dying
again
and
again
she
pleaded
with
him
but
he
had
either
reached
the
limit
of
his
physical
endurance
or
shaken
and
unnerved
he
had
not
the
courage
to
attempt
the
steep
climb
he
lay
still
his
eyes
were
shut
and
to
gloria
too
came
the
swift
fear
that
the
man
might
be
dying
i
am
coming
to
you
she
called
she
began
making
the
hazardous
descent
she
did
not
take
time
to
ask
herself
if
she
could
make
it
she
knew
only
that
she
must
she
set
foot
on
the
narrow
sloping
ledge
outside
brushing
off
the
snow
with
her
boot
clinging
with
her
hands
to
a
splinter
of
granite
feeling
her
way
cautiously
careful
to
move
inch
by
inch
along
the
way
down
which
she
had
gone
twice
with
mark
king
her
fingers
already
cold
when
she
started
went
numb
they
were
at
all
times
either
in
pits
and
pockets
of
snow
or
gripping
the
rough
stone
that
was
painfully
but
steadily
she
climbed
down
and
down
she
strove
not
to
look
down
she
had
no
eyes
for
gratton
who
now
sat
upright
his
jaw
still
sagging
and
marvelled
at
her
a
dozen
times
he
was
prepared
to
see
her
slip
and
fall
after
a
weary
time
she
came
to
the
base
of
the
cliffs
gratton
was
not
a
dozen
paces
from
her
he
looked
to
her
like
a
sick
man
gaunt
unkempt
unshaven
as
she
had
never
seen
him
before
he
was
like
some
caricature
of
the
immaculate
gratton
of
san
francisco
he
did
not
move
but
looked
at
her
in
a
strange
bewildered
fashion
plainly
he
had
had
no
knowledge
of
her
being
here
he
could
not
explain
her
presence
he
was
every
whit
as
dumbfounded
as
he
would
have
been
had
she
dropped
down
upon
him
out
of
the
sky
seeing
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
move
she
started
to
come
to
him
she
was
standing
upon
a
rock
she
stepped
off
into
the
snow
and
in
a
flash
had
sunk
to
her
breast
a
cry
broke
from
her
as
thus
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
learned
what
it
was
to
seek
to
force
a
way
through
deep
snow
in
its
individual
flakes
in
mass
it
made
haste
impossible
to
push
on
six
inches
through
it
was
labour
to
come
a
dozen
paces
to
gratton
was
hard
work
she
floundered
as
she
had
seen
him
flounder
she
threw
herself
forward
as
he
had
done
and
sinking
with
every
effort
at
last
reached
his
side
it
you
gloria
gaynor
he
muttered
but
i
do
understand
i
came
with
mark
king
the
storm
caught
us
just
as
it
caught
you
but
you
must
come
with
me
if
you
lie
here
you
will
be
chilled
you
will
freeze
later
we
can
tell
each
other
everything
he
shook
his
head
i
ca
he
groaned
i
am
more
dead
than
alive
i
tell
you
i
have
been
living
through
days
and
nights
of
hell
hell
populated
by
raging
demons
i
have
been
since
before
dawn
getting
here
he
cast
a
bleak
look
up
along
the
cliffs
and
shuddered
i
rather
lie
here
and
die
than
attempt
it
once
more
gloria
was
urging
and
pleading
but
in
the
end
she
gave
over
hopelessly
seeing
that
gratton
would
not
budge
and
it
was
so
clear
to
her
that
he
would
perish
if
he
lay
here
there
a
hole
in
the
cliffs
just
yonder
gratton
said
drearily
god
knows
what
wild
beasts
may
be
in
it
but
i
was
going
to
crawl
in
there
when
you
called
then
gloria
saw
for
the
first
time
the
opening
to
that
cave
which
in
gus
ingle
bible
had
been
set
down
as
caive
number
one
it
was
almost
directly
under
king
cave
at
the
base
of
the
cliffs
the
snow
came
close
to
concealing
it
entirely
as
it
was
just
a
ragged
black
hole
showed
a
couple
of
feet
above
the
come
then
she
said
let
see
if
it
big
enough
for
a
shelter
it
may
do
as
well
as
the
other
gratton
heaved
himself
up
with
a
groan
gloria
did
not
wait
for
him
but
began
the
tedious
breaking
of
a
path
the
few
feet
to
the
hole
too
earnest
in
the
endeavour
even
to
note
how
gratton
came
along
behind
without
suggesting
that
it
was
the
man
place
to
break
trail
thus
gloria
came
first
to
the
lower
cave
she
hesitated
and
listened
her
fancies
stimulated
by
his
suggestion
of
animals
and
sought
to
peer
into
the
dark
she
could
see
nothing
she
heard
nothing
nothing
save
gratton
hard
breathing
close
behind
her
she
got
a
grip
upon
herself
and
made
a
step
forward
paused
extended
her
arms
to
grope
for
a
wall
and
made
another
step
there
was
still
no
sound
she
breathed
more
freely
assuring
herself
that
save
for
herself
the
cavern
was
empty
she
stumbled
over
a
rock
stopped
again
and
called
to
gratton
only
now
was
he
entering
light
a
match
she
commanded
my
hands
are
dead
with
cold
he
muttered
i
do
know
if
i
have
a
match
wait
a
minute
he
began
a
slow
search
finally
she
knew
that
he
had
found
a
match
she
heard
it
scratch
against
a
rock
then
she
heard
gratton
curse
nervously
the
match
had
broken
and
his
knuckles
had
scraped
along
the
rock
the
second
match
he
gave
to
her
she
struck
it
carefully
cupped
the
tiny
flame
with
her
hands
and
strove
to
see
what
lay
about
her
the
little
light
gave
but
poor
assistance
to
her
straining
eyes
but
she
did
see
that
there
was
a
litter
of
dead
limbs
about
her
feet
she
began
gathering
up
some
of
the
smaller
branches
groping
for
others
as
her
match
burned
out
again
gratton
searched
his
pockets
he
found
more
matches
and
some
scraps
of
paper
it
was
gloria
hands
which
started
the
fire
and
placed
the
bits
of
dry
wood
upon
it
the
flames
crackled
the
wood
caught
like
tinder
the
flickering
light
retrieved
much
of
the
cavern
about
them
from
the
utter
dark
here
i
stay
said
gratton
he
dropped
down
and
began
warming
his
shaking
hands
a
more
abjectly
miserable
specimen
of
humanity
gloria
had
never
looked
upon
he
was
jaded
spiritless
cowed
but
he
was
a
human
being
and
she
was
no
longer
alone
across
the
empty
desolation
he
had
come
to
her
one
who
had
lived
as
she
had
lived
who
knew
another
world
than
this
who
could
understand
what
she
suffered
because
he
too
suffered
there
came
a
space
of
time
all
too
brief
during
which
her
heart
sang
within
her
she
was
lifted
from
despair
to
a
realm
bright
with
hope
king
had
gone
for
succour
she
had
a
companion
to
share
with
her
the
dread
hours
of
waiting
she
began
a
swift
planning
she
caught
up
a
burning
brand
as
she
had
seen
mark
king
do
and
holding
it
high
made
a
quick
survey
going
timidly
step
by
step
further
from
the
entrance
deeper
into
the
cavern
it
was
much
like
the
one
so
high
above
of
what
shape
she
could
hardly
guess
so
many
were
the
hollows
in
floor
roof
and
walls
so
many
were
the
arms
reaching
further
than
she
dared
go
gratton
could
not
or
would
not
climb
to
the
higher
cave
then
why
should
they
not
make
this
their
shelter
she
would
have
to
climb
the
cliffs
again
but
she
would
have
to
do
that
in
any
case
once
up
there
it
would
be
so
simple
a
matter
to
toss
down
blankets
and
food
and
cooking
utensils
a
would
see
her
camp
moved
from
one
cave
to
the
other
eager
and
excited
she
began
to
tell
gratton
what
she
meant
to
do
wait
a
while
he
urged
her
i
am
terribly
shaken
gloria
i
have
lived
through
experiences
which
a
week
ago
i
would
have
thought
unbearable
he
shuddered
she
saw
that
when
he
said
he
was
terribly
shaken
he
had
not
exaggerated
and
in
the
glare
of
his
eyes
she
read
that
utterly
unnerved
he
dreaded
to
be
left
alone
even
while
she
went
up
the
cliffs
i
would
say
that
a
man
would
have
died
or
gone
mad
with
the
strain
that
i
have
lived
through
i
know
she
said
gently
i
can
guess
but
when
you
get
good
and
warm
and
rest
i
will
make
you
a
hot
cup
of
coffee
i
have
this
it
better
than
coffee
for
me
now
he
untied
the
mouth
of
the
bag
with
shaking
fingers
groped
through
its
contents
and
at
last
brought
out
a
flask
nearly
full
of
an
amber
liquid
it
the
stuff
brodie
crowd
makes
he
explained
unstoppering
the
flask
they
got
more
of
it
than
food
with
them
curse
their
bestial
hearts
stuff
which
way
back
in
ancient
history
which
means
a
week
ago
i
no
more
have
thought
of
drinking
than
i
drink
poison
but
it
has
saved
the
life
in
me
he
put
the
bottle
to
his
lips
and
swallowed
three
or
four
times
he
sat
afterward
making
a
wry
face
his
full
eyes
blinking
but
gradually
a
faint
bit
of
colour
made
his
pasty
cheeks
something
less
and
the
powerful
raw
corn
whiskey
injected
into
his
blood
a
little
reassurance
let
me
rest
a
bit
and
get
warm
he
asked
of
her
i
i
rather
you
did
leave
me
just
yet
gloria
knowing
so
well
what
it
was
to
have
raw
quivering
nerves
she
tried
to
smile
at
him
and
saying
as
lightly
as
she
could
why
of
course
there
no
hurry
began
to
gather
what
bits
of
wood
lay
about
piling
them
on
the
fire
thus
she
noted
where
evidently
long
ago
there
had
been
another
fire
kindled
against
the
wall
of
rock
some
one
else
had
camped
here
perhaps
during
and
this
explained
the
fuel
wood
so
conveniently
placed
meanwhile
gratton
took
a
second
pull
at
his
flask
set
it
carefully
aside
and
stood
up
swinging
his
arms
to
get
the
blood
running
beating
his
hands
against
his
thighs
stamping
gingerly
he
began
looking
at
her
curiously
presently
he
said
do
you
think
we
are
ever
going
to
get
out
of
this
alive
yes
her
voice
rang
with
assurance
mark
king
has
gone
for
help
all
we
have
to
do
is
wait
for
a
few
days
his
pale
brows
flew
up
king
he
has
gone
he
has
left
you
alone
here
again
she
said
yes
gratton
began
plucking
at
his
lip
striding
up
and
down
now
it
became
obvious
to
her
that
there
had
been
nothing
wrong
within
him
beyond
what
his
frantic
terror
had
done
to
him
perhaps
left
alone
he
would
have
died
out
there
in
the
snow
now
having
already
leaned
on
her
having
her
company
and
the
hope
she
held
out
he
began
to
look
his
old
self
now
i
go
for
the
things
in
the
other
cave
she
suggested
and
as
an
afterthought
now
that
you
are
feeling
better
perhaps
you
will
go
up
with
me
and
help
why
he
said
why
of
course
yes
we
both
go
for
in
his
new
mood
warmed
by
the
fire
and
the
raw
whiskey
and
further
having
seen
that
she
had
done
the
thing
with
no
mishap
he
was
willing
to
do
what
before
he
could
not
do
come
he
said
let
hurry
along
the
paths
they
had
already
made
it
was
a
much
easier
matter
to
make
the
return
trip
at
the
cliffs
gratton
allowed
gloria
to
go
ahead
since
she
knew
the
way
up
and
he
did
not
he
followed
her
closely
and
at
first
with
little
difficulty
or
hesitation
the
higher
they
climbed
however
the
slower
he
went
once
he
hesitated
so
long
that
she
began
to
believe
that
dizziness
had
overcome
him
and
that
he
was
coming
no
further
but
at
length
she
came
to
the
ledge
and
the
wall
king
had
made
and
gratton
looking
up
and
seeing
her
above
him
began
climbing
again
gloria
held
aside
the
canvas
flap
he
followed
her
into
the
cave
her
fire
though
low
still
burned
for
the
sake
of
more
light
she
put
on
more
dry
wood
from
the
great
heap
king
had
left
for
her
she
began
to
look
about
planning
swiftly
just
how
easiest
to
move
the
few
belongings
which
must
go
with
her
she
could
pile
odds
and
ends
into
a
blanket
she
could
remake
the
canvas
roll
as
king
had
done
so
often
she
and
gratton
could
drag
the
bundles
to
the
front
of
the
cave
and
push
them
over
down
the
cliffs
first
we
get
things
together
all
in
a
heap
she
said
aloud
he
came
forward
and
stood
warming
his
nervous
hands
at
her
fire
his
eyes
everywhere
at
once
he
marked
the
shipshape
air
of
the
cavern
the
parcels
which
were
supper
and
three
poor
little
meals
each
set
carefully
apart
from
the
others
on
the
rock
shelf
he
saw
how
the
firewood
was
piled
in
its
place
not
scattered
how
bed
and
king
looked
almost
comfortable
because
of
the
how
the
clean
pots
and
pans
were
in
their
places
then
he
turned
his
full
eyes
like
searchlights
upon
the
girl
and
you
he
said
marvelling
actually
came
with
a
man
like
king
into
a
place
like
this
i
was
a
fool
cried
gloria
a
pitiful
little
fool
oh
had
she
been
thinking
less
of
gloria
and
more
of
this
other
man
with
whom
she
was
now
to
cope
she
must
have
marked
a
certain
swift
change
in
his
attitude
it
became
less
furtive
more
assured
his
eyes
left
her
to
rove
again
lingered
with
the
two
couches
and
returned
to
her
you
found
king
was
your
kind
he
announced
you
have
quarrelled
from
the
very
beginning
she
replied
quickly
he
is
unthinkable
i
would
have
left
him
long
ago
only
only
there
was
no
place
to
go
gratton
finished
it
for
her
and
now
he
continued
slowly
studying
her
you
are
willing
to
come
with
me
yes
she
told
him
unhesitatingly
but
he
offered
musingly
you
refused
me
once
and
turned
to
him
have
i
told
you
i
was
a
fool
i
did
know
then
quite
what
men
were
some
men
she
was
not
measuring
every
word
now
she
meant
simply
that
she
was
determined
to
have
done
with
mark
king
holding
bitterly
that
she
hated
him
that
she
would
go
to
any
one
to
be
definitely
through
with
king
yet
he
had
time
to
weigh
her
words
and
draw
from
each
one
his
own
significance
his
eyes
followed
her
as
she
gathered
up
her
few
personal
and
intimate
possessions
comb
brush
little
silken
things
of
pale
pink
and
blue
a
faint
colour
seeped
into
the
usually
colourless
lips
at
which
his
teeth
were
suddenly
gnawing
when
she
saw
the
look
in
his
eyes
she
stared
at
him
wonderingly
what
is
it
she
asked
her
voice
puzzled
what
is
what
gratton
laughed
but
the
look
was
still
there
his
eyes
did
not
laugh
what
makes
you
look
like
that
what
are
you
thinking
now
it
was
he
who
was
vaguely
puzzled
then
he
shrugged
i
was
just
thinking
how
superb
you
are
he
replied
not
entirely
untruthfully
for
his
ulterior
thought
had
been
reared
upon
the
vital
fact
of
her
triumphant
beauty
the
compliment
was
too
much
like
hundreds
she
had
received
in
her
life
to
alarm
her
rather
it
pleased
what
word
of
praise
had
she
heard
during
these
latter
days
his
voice
sounded
queerly
as
though
his
breath
came
with
difficulty
maybe
it
did
since
he
was
no
outdoors
man
and
to
him
the
climb
up
the
rocks
and
the
brief
journey
along
the
mountain
flank
was
a
painful
labour
certain
it
was
that
the
faint
flush
was
still
in
the
sallow
cheeks
suddenly
he
lifted
his
hands
putting
them
out
toward
her
she
saw
again
the
strange
look
in
his
eyes
gloria
he
said
hoarsely
you
are
wonderful
and
you
have
come
to
me
gloria
met
his
rather
too
ardent
admiration
with
that
cool
little
laugh
which
had
been
her
weapon
in
other
days
she
was
not
afraid
of
gratton
she
had
led
and
he
had
followed
she
had
commanded
and
he
had
obeyed
here
was
a
pleasant
change
from
king
masterfulness
and
she
fully
intended
to
hold
gratton
well
in
hand
i
came
to
you
she
said
frankly
because
i
was
a
woman
in
distress
and
had
no
alternative
that
there
has
ever
been
any
unpleasantness
between
us
does
not
alter
that
fact
you
understand
me
do
you
he
hardly
heard
her
to
his
mind
the
situation
was
clearness
itself
gloria
had
come
alone
into
the
forest
with
mark
king
she
had
been
with
him
all
these
days
and
nights
but
she
and
king
had
quarrelled
tired
of
each
other
already
perhaps
gratton
did
not
care
what
the
reason
was
he
was
gloatingly
satisfied
with
the
outcome
he
had
always
coveted
her
it
took
much
to
stir
his
pale
blood
and
only
the
superb
beauty
of
gloria
gaynor
had
ever
fully
done
so
king
had
stolen
her
away
but
she
had
left
him
and
had
come
straight
to
gratton
he
came
a
step
closer
and
the
firelight
showed
how
the
muscles
of
his
throat
were
working
gloria
eyes
widened
but
not
yet
did
she
fully
understand
and
not
yet
did
she
fear
gratton
she
began
gloria
he
cried
out
gloria
his
hands
suddenly
flung
out
were
upon
her
she
tore
them
away
wrenched
herself
free
from
him
and
started
back
as
she
did
so
her
little
silken
bundle
dropped
at
her
feet
gratton
caught
it
up
and
buried
his
face
in
it
now
as
he
looked
up
at
her
his
eyes
and
all
that
she
could
see
of
his
face
were
stamped
with
that
which
lay
in
his
heart
oh
she
cried
shrinking
not
so
much
from
him
as
from
the
thing
she
read
so
plainly
at
last
surely
you
do
not
think
you
do
not
misinterpret
my
being
here
at
all
my
being
with
king
no
cried
gratton
wildly
i
misinterpret
nothing
you
came
alone
with
him
into
the
mountains
what
chance
is
there
for
two
interpretations
there
you
gave
yourself
to
him
you
saw
your
mistake
you
hated
him
you
have
come
to
me
i
have
always
loved
you
i
want
you
her
cheeks
flamed
red
with
hot
anger
there
was
a
flutter
in
her
heart
a
wild
tremor
in
her
blood
she
drew
back
from
him
he
followed
his
arms
out
she
was
amazed
for
the
moment
shocked
into
consternation
and
yet
she
knew
no
such
terror
as
had
been
hers
when
king
had
advanced
on
her
rope
in
hand
her
new
contempt
of
gratton
was
too
high
for
that
now
she
marked
the
small
stature
little
taller
little
stronger
than
her
own
the
pale
face
the
narrow
chest
the
slender
body
you
know
what
i
mean
what
i
want
he
was
muttering
that
sweet
innocence
is
all
right
in
its
place
but
that
place
is
not
here
alone
in
the
mountains
with
a
man
man
she
burst
out
scathingly
you
why
you
wretched
little
beast
but
gratton
his
brain
reeling
with
hot
fancy
came
on
you
were
afraid
of
king
you
said
that
he
made
you
do
what
he
wanted
what
about
me
you
are
going
to
do
what
i
tell
you
i
by
god
i
will
make
you
beast
you
call
me
no
more
beast
than
any
other
man
i
have
wanted
you
all
these
years
you
have
wanted
me
or
you
would
not
have
been
so
glad
to
see
me
only
a
few
days
ago
you
were
ready
to
marry
me
and
now
his
arms
groped
for
her
gloria
swept
up
a
dead
pine
limb
that
lay
by
the
fire
and
swung
it
in
both
hands
and
struck
him
full
across
the
face
he
reeled
back
and
stood
half
in
the
shadow
his
shoulders
to
the
rock
wall
his
hands
to
his
face
you
beast
she
panted
you
cowardly
contemptible
beast
from
the
way
in
which
he
brought
his
hand
down
and
looked
at
it
and
laid
it
back
upon
his
lips
she
knew
that
his
mouth
was
bleeding
and
she
read
in
the
gesture
and
in
the
man
whole
cringing
attitude
that
the
danger
of
any
physical
violence
from
him
was
past
and
done
with
in
the
grip
of
his
passion
ugly
as
it
was
he
had
risen
somewhat
from
his
essential
weakness
in
the
moment
he
had
at
least
thought
of
himself
as
a
conqueror
now
he
was
again
what
he
always
really
was
at
heart
a
contemptible
coward
an
absolutely
new
sense
of
elation
sang
through
gloria
blood
she
was
fully
mistress
of
the
situation
and
had
found
within
her
an
unguessed
strength
physically
superb
at
all
times
because
nature
had
richly
gifted
her
now
she
was
magnificent
gratton
she
said
swiftly
you
have
made
a
mistake
king
has
never
offered
me
violence
of
that
sort
remember
that
though
we
are
alone
and
in
the
mountains
i
am
the
same
gloria
gaynor
that
you
have
known
and
be
sure
that
you
treat
me
as
such
he
nursed
his
battered
lips
and
stared
at
her
the
blow
had
dazed
him
slowly
as
his
mind
cleared
there
dawned
in
it
the
realization
that
he
made
a
mistake
the
stick
was
still
in
her
hands
a
shiver
ran
through
him
his
desire
went
out
of
him
i
wish
to
god
i
had
never
seen
you
he
groaned
she
had
meant
from
the
first
to
take
the
upper
hand
now
she
was
almost
glad
that
this
had
happened
for
now
she
was
very
sure
of
herself
gratton
had
merely
been
bold
like
other
young
men
who
had
sought
to
presume
he
had
been
cruder
simply
because
the
situation
seemed
to
his
mind
to
offer
the
opportunity
now
a
blow
from
her
had
accomplished
the
work
of
a
haughty
look
in
encounters
with
those
other
young
men
she
dropped
the
stick
and
wiped
her
hands
we
have
other
things
to
think
of
she
said
she
might
have
been
a
young
queen
who
had
punished
a
subject
and
now
from
her
exalted
place
condescended
to
consider
that
the
indignity
offered
her
royal
person
had
never
occurred
she
began
dragging
the
blankets
from
her
bed
tumbling
them
to
the
floor
take
these
she
commanded
i
was
a
fool
for
ever
leaving
san
francisco
he
muttered
bitterly
you
let
me
think
that
you
cared
for
me
and
now
you
treat
me
like
a
dog
i
spent
time
and
money
trying
to
be
the
one
to
find
gold
in
these
infernal
mountains
and
i
find
nothing
but
storm
and
starvation
i
believe
there
ever
was
gold
here
he
stopped
at
his
own
words
his
eyes
flying
wide
open
during
these
later
hours
fleeing
from
brodie
men
stumbling
upon
gloria
swirled
away
by
mad
longings
he
had
not
thought
of
gold
but
here
was
king
camp
straight
here
had
king
come
after
gloria
had
brought
him
her
father
message
and
old
honeycutt
secret
then
the
gold
was
here
the
cupidity
which
in
the
man
never
slept
long
was
awake
on
the
instant
he
began
looking
about
him
eagerly
king
was
gone
then
not
for
men
to
bring
help
to
gloria
but
to
aid
him
in
carrying
off
the
gold
having
brought
gloria
here
so
that
she
could
not
tell
others
what
she
knew
he
left
her
here
with
the
same
purpose
so
gratton
would
have
done
king
would
have
hidden
it
here
at
least
some
of
it
he
began
questing
feverishly
shuffling
about
in
the
shadows
while
gloria
busy
with
her
plans
for
moving
wondered
at
him
he
was
striking
matches
running
back
and
forth
she
could
hear
his
mutterings
and
presently
when
gloria
had
called
and
he
had
not
heard
he
came
upon
the
bag
which
king
had
meant
to
take
out
with
him
that
day
the
horse
was
lost
he
hovered
over
it
he
struck
other
matches
he
came
hastening
back
dragging
it
after
him
he
went
down
on
his
knees
by
the
sack
got
a
heavy
lump
in
his
hands
rubbed
at
it
held
it
closer
to
the
firelight
rubbed
again
more
excitedly
and
finally
sat
back
staring
up
at
her
with
new
flames
of
another
sort
leaping
in
his
eyes
it
next
thing
to
solid
gold
he
gasped
there
are
thousands
thousands
millions
she
looked
at
him
and
marvelled
in
his
shallow
soul
no
emotion
lived
long
greed
of
gold
now
obliterated
the
little
ripples
that
another
greed
had
fleetingly
made
how
had
she
thought
well
of
him
down
in
the
city
how
had
she
so
much
as
tolerated
him
on
the
instant
it
struck
her
that
there
was
small
justice
in
gratton
reaping
any
reward
having
done
nothing
to
earn
it
we
have
the
things
to
move
come
hurry
why
should
we
move
after
all
he
demanded
sharply
now
that
i
have
got
up
here
why
not
stay
there
wood
here
everything
is
fixed
up
after
a
fashion
king
would
know
where
to
send
for
us
and
and
those
cursed
dogs
of
brodie
would
never
think
of
looking
up
here
even
if
chance
did
lead
them
along
the
gorge
gloria
recalling
king
warning
remembering
brodie
brute
face
said
hastily
do
you
think
there
is
any
real
danger
that
they
will
come
this
way
i
hope
not
he
groaned
they
could
follow
my
trail
if
they
tried
to
you
see
i
left
them
last
night
as
early
as
i
dared
i
struck
out
in
a
straight
line
down
the
slope
then
i
made
a
turn
off
to
the
side
and
along
the
ridge
where
there
was
but
little
snow
by
now
all
those
tracks
are
wiped
out
what
with
wind
and
new
snow
there
nothing
to
lead
them
this
way
then
if
we
go
down
quickly
if
we
get
your
bag
of
food
and
put
out
the
fire
down
there
and
come
right
back
up
it
wo
be
very
long
before
our
tracks
will
be
gone
and
we
not
budge
from
here
until
help
comes
come
let
hurry
coming
said
gratton
yes
we
must
hurry
she
went
ahead
and
began
to
clamber
down
the
cliffs
down
she
wondered
why
he
was
not
following
she
found
a
place
where
she
could
cling
and
look
up
thus
she
was
just
in
time
to
see
him
standing
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
clutching
a
heavy
bag
he
had
been
tying
the
mouth
of
it
now
he
cast
it
outward
so
that
it
fell
striking
against
the
and
then
rolling
and
dropping
to
disappear
at
last
in
the
below
and
then
he
began
though
hesitantly
to
follow
her
that
one
thing
mark
king
wo
get
he
announced
with
emphasis
at
last
he
stood
beside
her
in
the
snow
no
matter
how
the
game
breaks
whether
he
comes
back
or
not
and
no
matter
who
gets
away
with
the
rest
that
bagful
is
mine
there
a
fortune
in
it
and
it
mine
he
began
tossing
double
handfuls
of
loose
snow
into
the
hole
which
the
bag
of
gold
had
made
when
i
get
a
chance
he
muttered
i
move
it
somewhere
else
his
avarice
disgusted
her
just
now
the
thought
of
gold
sickened
we
are
wasting
time
she
reminded
him
he
followed
her
again
casting
a
last
look
behind
him
then
looking
up
at
the
sky
grey
everywhere
except
for
a
long
patch
of
blue
what
we
want
is
another
three
or
four
hours
of
steady
snowing
he
was
saying
when
they
slipped
into
the
mouth
of
the
lower
cave
enough
to
hide
that
and
to
cover
up
our
paths
gloria
was
already
trying
to
put
out
the
fire
if
ill
fortune
should
lead
brodie
crowd
here
it
would
be
just
as
well
if
they
found
no
smouldering
sticks
to
tell
them
that
the
fugitives
had
been
here
so
short
a
time
ago
and
could
not
be
far
off
she
called
to
gratton
to
help
her
he
stamped
out
burning
brands
while
she
hastened
back
and
forth
bringing
handfuls
of
snow
with
which
to
extinguish
the
last
glowing
coals
she
worked
vigorously
and
swiftly
he
only
since
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
maybe
he
said
thoughtfully
i
better
bring
that
bag
in
here
and
hide
it
somewhere
far
back
in
the
dark
no
she
said
leave
it
where
it
is
we
must
hurry
back
to
the
other
cave
but
he
grew
stubborn
over
it
the
storm
might
end
at
any
time
the
sun
might
melt
all
this
fluffy
snow
the
bag
then
would
be
for
any
one
to
see
heedless
of
her
expostulations
he
left
her
extinguishing
the
fire
and
went
back
for
the
gold
he
was
gone
several
minutes
digging
after
it
she
had
finished
her
task
when
he
reappeared
dragging
the
heavy
sack
after
him
he
disappeared
swiftly
going
into
the
deeper
dark
of
the
further
end
of
the
cave
she
heard
him
moving
with
shuffling
feet
what
a
treacherous
thieving
petty
animal
he
was
she
started
and
whirled
about
there
was
a
new
sound
in
the
air
a
low
mumble
a
vague
murmur
men
voices
outside
coming
nearer
swiftly
were
men
her
first
thought
was
of
king
then
she
knew
that
it
was
too
soon
for
him
to
have
gotten
out
of
the
mountains
found
assistance
and
returned
a
deep
heavy
bass
voice
drowned
out
the
others
it
was
like
a
growl
ominous
sinister
gloria
whirled
again
this
time
toward
the
dark
into
which
gratton
had
gone
blindly
she
hurried
after
him
she
stumbled
but
kept
on
she
could
hear
him
at
work
hiding
his
gold
at
last
she
was
at
his
side
she
clutched
at
his
sleeve
listen
she
whispered
they
are
outside
they
have
followed
you
she
felt
his
arm
stiffen
as
from
head
to
foot
he
grew
rigid
she
heard
his
breath
whistling
through
his
nostrils
she
could
hear
the
beating
of
his
heart
or
was
it
her
own
the
voices
came
nearer
rose
higher
gratton
began
to
shake
as
with
a
terrible
chill
if
they
find
me
oh
my
god
if
they
find
me
benny
killed
a
man
he
thought
had
the
bacon
i
had
it
all
the
time
my
god
gloria
if
they
find
me
sh
she
commanded
be
still
maybe
they
will
go
by
the
voices
came
nearer
passed
on
two
or
three
men
out
there
were
speaking
at
once
then
all
were
silent
the
silence
lasted
so
long
that
gloria
began
to
breathe
again
surely
surely
brodie
and
his
men
had
gone
then
again
came
brodie
deep
sinister
voice
back
this
way
boys
he
shouted
he
gone
in
here
we
trapped
the
dirty
white
rat
gloria
and
gratton
clung
to
each
other
too
terrified
to
move
gratton
had
he
been
left
to
his
own
devices
would
have
stood
where
he
was
frozen
to
the
ground
in
terror
gloria
tugged
at
him
whispering
over
and
over
they
are
coming
do
you
hear
them
quick
we
must
try
to
hide
at
last
he
seemed
to
awaken
from
a
trance
he
started
and
began
hurrying
with
her
crowding
by
her
stumbling
on
ahead
in
the
darkness
seeking
the
cave
unfathomed
depths
of
darkness
she
heard
him
stumble
and
fall
she
ran
blindly
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
again
whispering
fiercely
you
must
be
silent
if
they
once
hear
us
we
have
no
chance
if
we
are
still
maybe
they
wo
find
us
after
that
he
moved
more
guardedly
but
still
he
crowded
ahead
once
in
his
excitement
when
she
brushed
against
him
and
he
thought
that
she
was
going
to
get
in
his
way
he
shoved
her
violently
aside
it
was
then
that
gloria
looking
back
saw
brodie
great
bulk
outlined
against
the
snow
outside
he
came
in
she
saw
his
rifle
his
figure
was
absorbed
in
the
shadows
she
saw
other
men
following
him
how
many
she
did
not
know
one
by
one
they
bulked
black
against
the
daylight
one
by
one
as
they
entered
they
were
lost
among
the
shadows
she
had
bumped
into
a
wall
of
rock
gratton
was
there
groping
in
all
directions
with
his
hands
she
could
hear
his
quick
dry
breathing
they
could
go
no
further
this
was
the
end
brodie
called
out
loudly
his
speech
dripping
with
his
habitual
vileness
he
shouted
gratton
better
step
out
lively
like
a
man
now
we
got
you
anyway
then
he
began
to
gather
the
scattered
firewood
a
match
flared
in
his
hand
his
face
leaped
out
of
the
dark
like
a
devil
or
a
madman
a
man
mad
with
a
rage
which
lusted
for
the
killing
of
another
man
gloria
heart
sank
in
despair
she
felt
as
though
she
were
going
to
faint
but
all
the
time
her
hands
like
gratton
had
been
groping
at
the
moment
when
she
felt
that
her
knees
were
giving
way
under
her
she
found
where
an
arm
of
the
cave
continued
narrow
slanting
upward
steeply
cluttered
with
blocks
of
stone
she
tugged
at
gratton
sleeve
she
crept
into
this
place
and
felt
him
close
behind
her
crowding
trying
to
press
by
her
she
gave
way
briefly
felt
him
scrape
past
and
began
crawling
following
again
only
a
few
feet
further
on
she
came
up
with
him
again
once
more
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
tunnel
he
was
crouching
flattened
against
the
rock
wall
they
were
in
a
pocket
with
no
outlet
save
the
way
they
had
come
she
stood
turned
toward
the
front
of
the
cave
and
waited
get
a
fire
going
boys
brodie
rumbling
bass
was
calling
assured
now
of
having
run
his
quarry
to
earth
he
took
a
wolfish
joy
from
the
moment
there
was
a
horrible
note
in
his
laughter
booming
out
suddenly
the
little
skunk
run
to
a
hole
we
smoke
him
out
he
spoke
of
gratton
as
though
he
were
a
frightened
animal
and
like
a
frightened
animal
gloria
felt
she
stooped
and
looked
toward
the
pursuers
thus
only
could
she
see
them
since
when
she
stood
erect
the
irregularities
of
the
rocks
above
hid
them
from
her
brodie
lighted
his
fire
the
other
men
dully
she
counted
them
now
there
were
five
of
them
all
told
were
gathering
wood
heaping
it
on
the
flames
leaped
crackled
lifted
their
voices
into
a
roar
volumes
of
white
smoke
shot
out
thinned
were
gone
the
light
flared
higher
brighter
dark
corners
and
crevices
were
made
palely
fight
she
could
see
the
faces
of
the
men
now
their
eyes
reflecting
the
fire
looking
like
the
eyes
of
wolves
brodie
carried
his
rifle
as
though
he
fully
intended
using
it
at
his
side
benny
rudge
fidgeted
and
blinked
by
benny
stood
that
scarecrow
of
a
man
brail
close
by
interested
spectators
were
the
squat
italian
and
the
man
who
had
brought
the
judge
to
marry
her
to
gratton
the
leering
steve
jarrold
more
fire
boys
called
brodie
again
his
ugly
laughter
boomed
out
i
think
i
see
where
he
is
whether
or
not
brodie
already
saw
them
it
appeared
clear
that
immediate
discovery
was
inevitable
for
there
was
no
further
here
to
creep
into
no
such
refuge
as
king
had
urged
gloria
to
hasten
to
if
brodie
came
she
remembered
the
caution
all
too
late
she
thought
of
king
with
wild
longing
while
gratton
cringed
and
pulled
back
and
tried
to
screen
his
body
with
hers
here
the
grub
he
stole
it
was
benny
cracked
nervous
voice
full
of
wrath
she
could
feel
gratton
shiver
as
he
crouched
against
her
sudden
disgust
filled
her
they
knew
that
he
was
here
they
would
take
him
in
a
minute
his
seeking
further
to
hide
was
so
futile
and
yet
he
was
not
man
enough
to
stand
forth
at
the
end
he
was
the
type
who
must
be
dragged
whimpering
and
pulling
back
pleading
for
mercy
even
when
he
knew
so
well
that
he
deserved
no
mercy
and
would
have
none
meted
out
to
him
gratton
had
his
one
last
chance
to
show
if
there
was
the
spark
of
manhood
in
him
they
did
not
yet
know
of
gloria
presence
and
had
he
stepped
out
now
he
might
have
given
her
a
chance
to
remain
unseen
but
no
such
heroism
suggested
itself
to
gratton
come
on
gratton
shouted
brodie
or
do
you
want
me
to
begin
shooting
from
here
the
light
of
the
fire
flared
higher
brighter
the
eyes
of
the
men
who
had
just
entered
from
the
outside
were
growing
accustomed
to
this
place
of
shadows
suddenly
the
man
jarrold
called
sharply
there
some
one
with
him
there
two
of
brodie
go
easy
brodie
cursed
him
for
a
fool
i
do
care
how
many
with
him
or
who
they
are
he
bellowed
the
thief
has
got
his
coming
to
him
step
out
you
sneak
and
take
your
medicine
that
all
right
muttered
jarrold
but
it
wo
hurt
to
see
who
they
are
first
brodie
gratton
got
no
gun
with
him
cackled
benny
rudge
neither
that
other
guy
come
ahead
steve
me
an
you
pull
out
gloria
pressed
back
against
the
rock
her
flesh
quivering
she
saw
two
men
and
then
another
two
coming
toward
her
the
first
sound
broke
from
gratton
lips
now
a
little
gurgling
moan
the
men
came
on
one
had
heard
and
laughed
then
gloria
with
more
shuddersome
thought
of
rough
hands
upon
her
than
of
a
broke
away
from
her
cowering
companion
and
came
hastily
to
meet
them
i
coming
out
she
cried
out
to
them
it
was
all
that
she
could
do
to
hold
herself
erect
and
come
back
into
the
more
open
cave
jarrold
and
benny
and
the
men
after
them
came
to
a
dead
halt
and
stared
at
her
in
the
flickering
she
looked
a
slim
frightened
boy
all
of
a
sudden
the
woods
is
gettin
all
cluttered
up
with
folks
grunted
benny
who
in
blazes
are
you
kid
an
where
your
mamma
his
companions
laughed
they
laughed
at
anything
one
of
them
steve
jarrold
came
closer
to
look
into
her
face
she
saw
that
his
steps
were
uncertain
she
had
heard
how
thick
was
his
vocal
utterance
now
she
smelled
the
whiskey
with
which
he
reeked
a
shout
broke
from
jarrold
he
clutched
her
shoulder
with
a
great
claw
of
a
hand
and
drew
her
closer
to
him
his
face
thrust
down
to
hers
let
me
go
she
cried
trying
to
jerk
away
from
him
easy
does
it
said
jarrold
easy
i
of
a
notion
i
seen
that
face
of
yours
somewheres
never
mind
the
kid
brodie
was
growling
savagely
it
gratton
first
out
with
him
benny
the
others
bore
down
upon
gratton
he
had
found
his
voice
now
he
shrieked
at
them
he
begged
shrilly
he
battered
them
with
his
fists
striking
weak
vain
blows
benny
though
the
smaller
man
had
him
by
the
collar
the
italian
caught
an
arm
and
as
they
dragged
him
toward
the
fire
brail
struck
at
him
with
a
heavy
boot
so
said
brodie
heavily
gratton
began
an
incoherent
pleading
arrested
impatiently
by
great
voice
shut
up
you
had
your
innings
it
mine
now
you
swiped
grub
when
it
the
same
thing
as
slitting
a
man
gullet
you
let
another
man
be
killed
for
what
you
done
now
you
get
yours
he
jerked
up
his
rifle
benny
and
the
italian
let
gratton
go
and
jumped
nimbly
aside
gratton
stumbled
and
sagged
staggering
like
a
drunken
man
brodie
with
his
not
six
feet
from
body
laughed
again
stop
gloria
shrilled
she
broke
away
from
jarrold
grasp
and
ran
toward
brodie
you
do
know
what
you
are
doing
you
close
your
trap
kid
brodie
thundered
at
her
unless
you
want
the
second
bullet
jarrold
big
boots
came
clumping
noisily
across
the
rock
floor
easy
does
it
brodie
he
shouted
she
ai
no
kid
i

girl

away
from
him
keep
your
eye
peeled
king
would
be
around
somewhere
hidin
back
there
in
the
dark
somewhere
muttered
benny
brodie
though
his
rifle
had
not
swerved
was
listening
no
not
hiding
in
the
dark
corners
he
said
ponderously
not
mark
king
rot
him
ben
gaynor
girl
you
say
then
we
red
hot
on
the
right
trail
boys
you
know
what
her
and
king
would
be
after
gratton
stunned
brain
began
to
function
wildly
the
gold
is
here
brodie
he
cried
out
wildly
king
had
got
to
it
before
us
but
i
found
it
i
was
coming
back
to
tell
you
brodie
had
small
liking
for
a
coward
and
now
his
bull
voice
cut
gratton
chatter
short
no
solid
mountain
of
gold
is
going
to
save
your
hide
benny
began
to
jig
up
and
down
in
a
frenzy
of
excitement
hold
your
hand
brodie
you
big
fool
he
shouted
he
even
jumped
to
brodie
side
and
caught
the
shoving
it
downward
if
he
does
know
where
it
is
give
him
a
show
to
lead
us
to
it
ai
you
got
any
sense
before
king
gets
back
if
you
popped
him
off
now
how
would
we
know
where
to
look
brodie
snarled
at
benny
and
whipped
the
rifle
clear
of
the
nervous
clutch
but
he
understood
what
benny
had
in
mind
and
saw
wisdom
in
obeying
the
command
to
hold
his
hand
his
gross
face
half
in
light
half
in
darkness
showed
a
look
of
hesitation
gratton
began
a
rapid
vehement
talking
explaining
arguing
pleading
he
had
not
meant
to
steal
the
food
he
could
lead
them
to
the
gold
he
wanted
none
of
it
all
that
he
asked
was
to
be
allowed
to
live
shut
up
brodie
cried
again
disgustedly
you
ai
dead
yet
are
you
so
you
keep
your
lying
face
closed
i
give
you
one
show
step
lively
is
gratton
like
a
hound
in
leash
suddenly
freed
turned
and
sped
toward
the
spot
where
he
had
hid
the
gold
brodie
his
rifle
shifting
in
his
hands
leaped
after
him
keeping
close
to
him
gratton
was
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
scratching
among
the
loose
stones
like
a
dog
digging
for
a
buried
bone
brodie
put
a
heavy
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
jerked
him
back
hurling
him
to
one
side
thus
it
was
brodie
who
found
the
bag
and
dragged
it
forward
to
the
fire
dumping
its
contents
on
the
ground
benny
was
with
him
now
pawing
over
the
heavy
lumps
brail
the
italian
steve
jarrold
all
rushed
forward
and
snatched
up
bits
of
the
ore
that
had
rolled
from
the
sack
one
of
them
shouted
in
wonder
another
seized
the
nugget
from
his
hands
they
all
talked
at
once
benny
squealed
in
high
rage
as
jarrold
shoved
him
backward
the
italian
trod
in
the
fire
and
cursed
and
kicked
at
it
savagely
sending
burning
brands
in
all
directions
gloria
had
stood
powerless
to
move
now
she
saw
that
in
their
flush
of
excitement
no
one
was
looking
toward
her
she
began
slowly
silently
edging
toward
the
side
of
the
cave
toward
the
way
out
her
one
thought
was
to
slip
away
while
none
noted
her
to
dart
out
and
hurry
up
the
cliff
to
come
to
the
of
which
mark
king
had
told
her
i
never
see
such
gold
and
me
an
in
the
mines
it
was
steve
jarrold
muttering
it
like
they
took
clean
gold
down
to
the
mint
and
rolled
it
and
lumped
it
into
nuggets
was
broke
off
the
mother
oh
my
gawd
gloria
made
another
quiet
step
and
another
still
no
one
saw
her
if
she
could
only
make
half
a
dozen
more
steps
before
these
men
awoke
from
the
first
moments
of
a
spell
that
had
made
them
oblivious
of
everything
on
earth
except
that
little
heap
of
rock
another
step
she
went
quicker
their
backs
were
toward
her
and
still
no
one
saw
yes
gratton
alone
had
seen
she
made
a
quick
frightened
gesture
his
jaw
sagged
open
he
watched
her
with
bulging
eyes
she
could
read
his
thought
so
plainly
he
was
thinking
of
his
own
ultimate
chances
for
life
he
was
screwing
up
his
courage
to
make
a
dash
for
the
open
himself
his
eyes
followed
her
step
by
step
oh
if
only
he
would
look
in
some
other
direction
if
any
one
of
them
saw
gratton
face
then
gratton
began
a
slow
withdrawal
from
the
others
he
meant
to
do
as
he
saw
her
doing
heavy
laka
hell
the
italian
was
saying
justa
da
gold
do
that
give
me
that
tony
snarled
brodie
he
snatched
the
mass
from
the
other
hands
that
the
biggest
nugget
any
man
living
ever
saw
gloria
tasted
the
clean
fresh
outside
air
she
was
within
three
paces
of
the
line
of
snow
then
there
was
a
sudden
noise
gratton
inching
off
backward
had
stumbled
over
a
dead
stick
the
men
by
the
fire
were
startled
out
of
their
oblivion
steve
jarrold
the
one
nearest
gloria
swung
about
saw
her
dropped
what
was
in
his
hands
and
lunged
towards
her
she
made
a
dash
for
the
exit
in
two
great
strides
jarrold
was
upon
her
and
had
caught
her
by
the
shoulders
dragging
her
back
and
gratton
stood
again
his
feet
glued
to
the
ground
she
could
see
the
flash
of
his
teeth
gnawing
at
his
fingers
trying
to
make
a
sneak
for
it
boomed
brodie
i
show
you
not
yet
brodie
you
big
fool
yelled
benny
this
is
only
a
sackful
and
not
full
at
that
it
the
rest
of
it
we
after
the
whole
lousy
mess
he
got
to
show
us
where
this
come
from
i
am
not
trying
to
get

said
gratton
though
his
tone
did
not
convince
have
i
made
good
already
have
i
kept
my
promise
am
i
not
ready
to
do
whatever
i
can
talk
cheap
retorted
brodie
get
busy
then
gratton
struggling
already
in
the
meshes
of
the
net
drawing
ever
tighter
about
him
pointed
to
gloria
with
shaking
finger
he
swallowed
twice
and
moistened
his
lips
to
speak
king
found
it
first
she
was
with
him
i
made
her
show
me
the
sack
of
gold
i
was
going
to
go
back
to
your
camp
to
tell
you
cut
it
commanded
brodie
leave
out
the
lies
and
talk
straight
and
fast
where
is
the
rest
of
it
where
did
this
come
from
i
trying
to
tell
you
said
gratton
hurriedly
there
another
cave
up
above
that
where
king
had
his
camp
that
where
i
got
the
sack
it
up
there
no
wonder
she
wanted
to
skip
out
jeered
steve
jarrold
his
great
bony
hand
locked
about
gloria
shrinking
shoulder
his
face
the
small
pig
eyes
always
jeering
the
black
bristle
of
beard
not
unlike
a
hog
bristles
were
thrust
close
to
her
face
king
all
this
time
he
demanded
up
in
the
other
cave
maybe
no
she
said
dismally
seeking
to
jerk
away
from
his
evil
glance
and
breath
he
has
gone
that
good
let
him
go
we
do
care
do
we
eh
girlie
but
again
his
hand
tightened
until
the
hard
fingers
hurt
her
but
gone
where
we
were
short
of
food
he
is
hunting
maybe
he
has
gone
for
help
and
you
showed
gratton
where
he
hid
his
gold
that
a
nice
little
ai
it
well
while
the
showing
good
lead
us
to
the
rest
of
it
that
the
eye
steve
said
brodie
he
stepped
forward
shoved
his
against
gratton
body
and
commanded
you
too
go
ahead
you
and
her
and
show
us
the
way
and
no
monkey
business
either
of
you
or
i
blow
a
hole
square
through
you
gratton
grown
nimble
darted
ahead
with
brodie
always
close
at
his
heels
gloria
forced
on
by
jarrold
came
next
and
after
them
the
others
benny
was
the
last
he
had
taken
time
to
put
the
gold
back
into
the
sack
and
set
it
aside
among
the
shadows
for
benny
believed
in
making
sure
of
what
they
had
even
while
they
quested
better
things
then
he
caught
up
his
rifle
the
only
other
gun
besides
brodie
and
came
hurrying
after
them
they
went
up
the
cliff
in
a
long
file
clawing
their
way
cursing
the
steepness
now
and
then
one
or
another
of
them
fumbling
uncertainly
close
to
a
slip
and
a
fall
it
was
clear
that
with
the
possible
exception
of
swen
brodie
not
a
man
of
them
was
entirely
sober
but
they
made
the
climb
safely
and
hastened
into
the
upper
cave
eagerly
it
somewhere
back
there
said
gratton
more
fire
shouted
brodie
his
voice
exulted
his
blood
would
be
running
now
with
the
gold
fever
he
tossed
on
an
armful
of
dry
wood
the
flames
caught
and
roared
shadows
quivered
and
danced
already
benny
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
cave
the
others
ran
after
him
even
jarrold
relinquished
gloria
arm
eager
to
be
in
at
the
finding
but
he
called
to
her
as
he
went
you
stick
where
you
are
i
not
forgetting
you
this
time
fascinated
she
watched
them
they
ran
like
dogs
that
had
briefly
lost
their
quarry
that
were
seeking
everywhere
in
every
cranny
with
slavering
jaws
they
turned
aside
into
of
the
main
cavern
they
got
torches
and
looked
high
and
low
they
went
back
and
forth
up
and
down
they
stumbled
against
one
another
and
cursed
angrily
they
caught
up
bits
of
stone
ran
back
to
the
fire
to
see
if
the
fragments
were
shot
with
gold
cursed
and
hurled
the
useless
things
from
them
and
ran
back
again
to
jostle
and
seek
and
be
first
they
were
not
so
much
like
dogs
now
as
human
hogs
fighting
to
get
first
into
the
trough
but
they
did
not
forget
gratton
and
they
did
not
forget
gloria
all
the
time
both
brodie
and
benny
kept
their
guns
in
their
hands
two
significant
looks
had
been
all
that
was
needed
to
keep
their
two
prisoners
in
mind
of
the
fact
that
no
escape
now
was
possible
to
gloria
it
seemed
inevitable
that
in
this
quest
which
overlooked
nothing
and
which
as
time
wore
on
grew
less
frenzied
and
more
systematic
they
would
find
what
king
had
found
before
them
she
tried
to
think
consecutively
she
recalled
all
that
king
had
told
her
of
these
men
all
that
gratton
had
hinted
at
she
recalled
with
a
shudder
the
look
in
the
moist
eyes
of
steve
jarrold
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
only
slim
chance
for
safety
lay
in
their
finding
the
gold
for
only
gold
gold
unlimited
could
cause
them
to
forget
her
for
an
hour
they
sought
tirelessly
it
appeared
that
there
were
many
fingers
to
the
further
end
of
the
cave
narrow
irregular
channels
into
which
they
pressed
their
faggots
burned
out
the
smoke
choked
them
they
coughed
and
cursed
came
out
for
fresh
air
dived
into
the
dark
again
the
short
day
was
passing
the
entering
light
where
they
had
torn
the
canvas
aside
grew
dimmer
and
still
they
searched
at
last
brodie
returned
and
stood
looking
from
gloria
to
gratton
one
of
you
knows
he
said
shortly
which
one
i
swear
to
god
began
gratton
shut
up
then
it
you
the
little
shiny
blue
eyes
never
so
coldly
evil
drew
her
own
frightened
eyes
fascinated
and
held
them
you
know
i
do
know
all
i
know
do
lie
to
me
it
do
you
no
good
he
lifted
a
hand
and
held
it
over
her
the
enormous
fingers
apart
and
rigid
i
make
you
tell
listen
to
me
she
managed
to
cry
out
i
do
know
i
tell
you
but
i
know
where
it
might
be
in
a
place
you
would
never
think
of
looking
not
in
a
thousand
years
blue
fire
sprang
up
in
the
gleaming
eyes
the
other
men
drawn
close
watched
and
listened
their
eyes
alive
with
many
lights
what
you
know
i
know
i
choke
it
out
of
you
i
tell
you
if
you
will
keep
your
hands
off
me
i
make
a
bargain
with
you
i
show
you
the
place
if
there
gold
there
i
do
care
what
happens
to
it
if
you
only
agree
to
let
me
alone
to
let
me
go
brodie
laughed
at
her
but
benny
cried
out
of
course
we
let
you
go
what
do
you
suppose
we
want
of
you
once
we
get
our
hands
on
it
she
can
go
brodie
tell
her
so
you
big
sure
said
brodie
with
a
wide
grin
it
ai
women
we
after
this
trick
it
something
better
and
and
it
would
be
very
nice
of
you
to
show
us
miss
gaynor
he
treated
her
to
a
grinning
mock
respect
so
obviously
spurious
that
her
fear
of
him
rose
higher
choking
her
very
nice
ai
it
boys
i
i
am
not
sure
what
you
find
whispered
gloria
i
only
know
that
oh
dear
god
i
hope
you
find
all
the
gold
in
the
world
hastily
she
ran
by
brodie
toward
the
dark
end
of
the
cave
then
she
stopped
and
tried
to
think
how
many
paces
had
king
said
she
came
back
to
the
fire
thirty
she
began
counting
as
she
walked
while
they
watched
her
wondering
and
following
slowly
after
her
she
found
several
boulders
in
her
path
but
she
had
not
gone
far
enough
she
kept
on
thirty
she
could
hardly
see
about
her
she
stumbled
against
a
rock
in
her
way
try
here
she
said
already
brodie
and
steve
jarrold
were
at
her
side
this
rock
see
if
it
will
move
they
thrust
her
roughly
aside
brodie
set
down
his
rifle
laid
his
big
hands
on
the
boulder
and
as
if
it
had
weighed
only
ten
pounds
tossed
it
out
of
the
way
he
knelt
feeling
along
the
ground
a
sudden
shout
burst
from
him
down
here
there
a
big
hole
there
a
dark
cave
underneath
where
it
is
they
brought
faggots
at
the
edge
of
the
hole
they
hastily
built
another
fire
they
crowded
round
peering
down
brodie
tossed
a
brand
through
it
dropped
a
short
distance
a
few
feet
only
struck
and
began
to
roll
it
caught
against
a
rock
smoked
and
smouldered
and
went
out
brodie
set
his
legs
over
the
opening
called
to
the
italian
to
grab
his
rifle
and
keep
an
eye
on
gloria
and
gratton
and
went
down
the
others
crowded
about
the
hole
waiting
impatiently
for
him
to
go
through
and
then
began
piling
down
after
him
gloria
could
see
their
figures
dimly
they
went
down
and
down
along
a
long
steep
slanting
they
had
smoking
torches
and
looked
like
so
many
fiends
in
the
bottomless
pit
she
heard
them
calling
back
and
forth
excitedly
they
went
on
still
downward
she
heard
their
grinding
but
could
no
longer
see
them
suddenly
they
were
silent
then
there
were
swift
mutterings
and
then
a
great
triumphant
shout
in
gus
they
had
at
last
come
to
gus
ingle
treasure
and
among
other
things
to
the
skeleton
of
gus
ingle
himself
sprawling
here
for
sixty
years
in
the
dark
over
a
great
heap
of
gold
swen
brodie
whose
will
had
at
all
times
directed
was
now
absolute
dictator
big
and
brutal
and
fearless
drunken
with
gold
he
loomed
above
his
companions
driving
them
commanding
them
swearing
violently
that
they
would
do
what
he
told
them
to
do
or
he
dash
their
brains
out
i
led
you
to
it
he
reminded
them
in
a
great
shouting
voice
but
for
me
never
a
man
of
you
would
of
smelled
it
there
enough
here
to
make
a
thousand
men
rich
and
that
lucky
for
you
but
we
got
to
hold
what
we
got
and
we
got
to
get
out
of
here
with
it
somehow
that
somehow
is
for
me
to
figure
out
and
being
as
one
man
got
to
run
any
job
and
the
rest
has
got
to
take
orders
and
take
on
the
jump
you
doing
what
i
say
if
any
man
jack
of
you
do
like
that
let
him
open
his
head
right
now
there
no
sense
scrappin
muttered
benny
an
we
all
satisfied
i
say
but
there
no
call
to
start
wavin
a
red
flag
we
going
down
to
the
lower
cave
said
brodie
everything
we
can
pry
loose
is
going
down
with
us
we
pitch
the
loose
chunks
of
gold
over
the
cliff
and
we
stow
away
somewhere
else
where
king
if
things
break
some
way
we
do
look
for
wo
find
we
start
right
now
while
there
daylight
what
more
we
move
our
camp
from
down
the
canon
to
the
cave
below
steve
jarrold
you
and
tony
are
elected
to
that
job
and
you
better
get
a
move
on
bring
up
what
grub
left
and
the
blankets
and
stuff
the
rest
of
us
will
start
in
firing
gold
overboard
and
putting
it
somewhere
more
safe
all
that
loose
and
at
that
think
of
the
great
big
wide
yellow
seam
of
it
down
below
where
are
you
goin
to
put
it
demanded
jarrold
not
hiding
it
from
you
and
tony
steve
cried
brodie
sharply
put
your
suspicious
ways
in
your
pocket
and
if
you
on
the
jump
have
our
camp
truck
moved
before
we
done
look
alive
will
you
a
man
never
knows
what
going
to
happen
why
not
leave
it
here
until
we
know
for
one
thing
because
mark
king
knows
this
place
now
move
come
ahead
you
other
fellows
you
too
gratton
we
ai
forgot
you
an
uglier
note
crept
into
the
harsh
voice
you
can
help
and
so
can
you
whirling
on
gloria
woman
or
no
woman
you
got
hands
and
feet
night
had
come
when
they
had
done
gloria
scarcely
able
to
stand
from
exhaustion
her
body
bruised
her
hands
and
arms
wounded
from
many
a
jagged
rock
as
she
had
gone
back
and
forth
carrying
heavy
loads
went
with
the
others
into
the
lowest
cave
in
which
already
the
gold
had
been
stowed
away
she
sank
down
wearily
she
closed
her
eyes
rather
than
watch
the
men
about
their
fire
eating
noisily
drinking
noisily
from
the
bottles
which
steve
and
tony
had
brought
from
their
other
camp
trying
to
remain
unnoticed
in
the
shadows
was
gratton
brodie
having
commanded
that
a
rude
rock
wall
like
king
be
built
across
the
mouth
of
the
cave
to
shut
out
the
cold
and
having
laboured
with
the
others
at
the
task
came
back
to
the
fire
he
took
a
long
pull
at
a
bottle
emptying
it
and
smashing
it
to
tinkling
fragments
as
he
hurled
it
behind
him
he
caught
up
a
big
piece
of
dried
beef
and
gnawed
at
it
like
a
dog
though
gloria
kept
her
eyes
away
from
him
she
could
hear
the
tearing
and
grinding
of
the
monstrous
teeth
it
been
a
day
work
at
that
he
said
with
a
full
mouth
but
we
ai
done
i
noticed
how
no
man
has
said
a
word
about
how
we
split
what
we
found
there
five
of
us
said
benny
quickly
we
split
it
five
ways
even
like
pardners
brodie
turned
on
him
slowly
still
rending
at
his
meat
still
clutching
his
rifle
and
holding
it
so
that
no
man
might
forget
that
he
held
it
think
so
benny
he
said
ponderously
being
as
i
worked
on
this
lay
a
long
time
since
i
let
you
others
in
on
it
since
i
led
you
to
it
think
that
the
fair
way
to
split
it
now
suppose
you
listen
to
me
you
boys
ai
mentioned
a
split
because
it
was
none
of
your
say
and
you
knew
it
say
in
round
numbers
but
there
ten
times
that
that
there
a
million
dollars
tucked
away
here
why
there
mines
all
through
these
mountains
that
never
thought
of
stopping
at
a
million
that
was
just
a
fair
start
well
to
get
going
say
there
an
even
million
i
get
just
half
that
that
leaves
half
a
million
do
it
now
shut
up
a
minute
he
commanded
truculently
as
more
than
one
man
stirred
listen
to
me
that
five
hundred
thousand
to
split
between
four
of
you
that
over
a
hundred
thousand
for
every
man
jack
of
you
and
that
what
i
call
a
fair
split
they
growled
in
their
throats
at
that
but
no
man
took
it
upon
himself
to
speak
out
definitely
though
they
glanced
sidewise
among
themselves
benny
who
always
had
a
thought
of
his
own
said
quietly
what
are
you
doin
about
gratton
he
claim
his
share
wo
he
and
if
you
say
him
no
he
shoot
his
face
off
wo
he
no
said
brodie
he
wo
he
paused
swallowed
the
last
of
his
beef
caught
up
a
bottle
from
benny
side
and
drank
deeply
benny
afraid
that
this
bottle
too
still
nearly
full
would
be
broken
hastily
snatched
it
back
when
brodie
had
done
no
said
brodie
heavily
gratton
wo
talk
he
grew
suddenly
he
broke
into
a
volley
of
accusation
his
tongue
lent
itself
to
such
a
rush
of
vileness
that
gloria
shrinking
back
covered
her
ears
with
her
hands
gratton
stole
grub
when
was
the
same
as
slitting
a
man
throat
and
what
next
does
he
plan
why
to
make
trouble
to
swear
that
benny
killed
a
man
that
we
was
all
in
it
to
get
us
all
hung
if
he
can
or
in
the
pen
then
to
grab
what
ours
look
at
him
you
can
see
it
in
his
frog
eyes
he
done
that
what
he
is
with
a
swift
gesture
his
gun
was
at
his
shoulder
gratton
scrambled
to
his
feet
with
a
choking
cry
gloria
too
had
sprung
up
sick
with
horror
she
looked
from
brodie
to
gratton
who
was
not
two
feet
from
her
she
saw
that
he
was
his
fear
was
choking
him
stopping
his
heart
paralysing
his
muscles
he
wanted
to
run
and
could
not
he
tried
to
speak
but
now
not
even
a
whisper
came
from
between
his
writhing
lips
slowly
an
unshaken
senseless
piece
of
machinery
brodie
raised
his
rifle
now
gratton
voice
returned
to
him
a
strangling
cry
broke
from
his
agonized
soul
a
hand
wildly
outthrown
caught
at
gloria
sleeve
you
there
called
brodie
stand
aside
unless
you
wanting
yours
too
her
own
heart
was
stopping
her
feet
were
leaded
she
understood
what
he
said
she
knew
that
it
was
to
her
that
he
spoke
but
she
believe
could
believe
that
he
meant
gratton
was
pressing
tight
to
gloria
seeking
futilely
to
get
behind
her
he
began
to
articulate
to
beg
to
promise
brodie
fired
a
great
reverberating
roar
filled
the
cavern
gloria
her
brain
gone
suddenly
numb
felt
the
grip
on
her
arm
tighten
convulsively
then
it
relaxed
slowly
gratton
his
eyes
bulging
his
mouth
wide
open
was
sinking
gloria
put
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
screamed
again
and
again
her
scream
broke
from
her
she
tried
to
draw
back
to
run
but
all
her
strength
was
gone
she
crumpled
and
settled
down
almost
as
gratton
had
done
and
so
close
to
him
that
she
brushed
him
with
her
knee
she
felt
the
body
twitch
she
leaped
to
her
feet
and
ran
blindly
screaming
she
struck
against
the
rock
wall
and
sank
down
again
the
wonder
was
that
she
did
not
swoon
outright
as
it
was
her
soul
seemed
to
float
dizzily
out
of
her
body
and
through
an
utter
dark
she
thought
that
she
was
dying
as
though
across
a
vast
distance
she
heard
voices
well
it
was
the
man
who
had
done
the
shooting
his
voice
truculent
anybody
got
anything
to
say
say
it
quick
if
you
have
there
was
a
silence
then
a
shuffling
of
feet
then
an
answering
voice
thin
and
querulous
it
was
benny
he
too
had
killed
his
man
he
had
it
coming
he
said
eagerly
any
judge
would
say
so
stole
every
bit
of
grub
when
stealing
grub
is
the
same
as
cutting
a
throat
just
like
you
said
brodie
he
had
it
coming
you
done
right
you
jarrold
demanded
brodie
got
anything
to
say
again
silence
then
again
a
voice
jarrold
saying
hurriedly
no
benny
right
he
had
it
coming
damn
fool
and
you
brail
and
you
tony
got
anything
to
say
talk
lively
brail
and
tony
like
the
others
before
them
were
quick
to
excuse
brodie
act
they
spoke
briefly
and
relapsed
into
silence
then
beginning
far
away
and
coming
closer
with
the
speed
of
an
onrushing
hurricane
gloria
heard
heavy
feet
crunching
in
the
dirt
and
gravel
a
hard
hand
gripped
her
shoulder
jerking
her
to
her
feet
you
friend
said
brodie
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
it
she
hung
limp
in
his
powerful
hand
speechless
he
dragged
her
closer
to
the
firelight
peering
at
her
with
his
eyes
do
forget
who
she
is
another
voice
was
saying
steve
jarrold
remember
what
i
told
you
it
was
as
though
he
prided
himself
on
the
fact
that
he
alone
knew
her
for
gaynor
daughter
and
from
it
derived
a
sort
of
ownership
of
her
for
while
the
others
had
never
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
until
now
he
had
filled
his
eyes
with
her
before
we
got
to
think
this
out
she
came
along
with
king
got
enough
of
him
and
switched
to
gratton
that
like
a
woman
brodie
let
her
slip
down
and
turned
away
from
her
his
mood
was
not
so
soon
for
a
woman
see
she
keeps
her
mouth
shut
he
said
threateningly
if
she
ai
got
sense
enough
for
that
she
ai
got
sense
to
go
on
living
benny
stooped
and
feasted
his
eyes
on
her
then
straightening
up
he
turned
to
jarrold
with
nodding
approval
she
skins
anything
ever
saw
he
admitted
in
some
strange
way
it
seemed
to
gloria
that
both
benny
and
brodie
had
consigned
her
to
jarrold
as
though
they
admitted
his
prior
claim
as
though
among
these
three
she
was
looked
upon
as
the
property
of
one
she
struggled
to
her
feet
do
let
her
go
said
brodie
that
all
i
got
to
say
about
her
right
now
she
made
an
uncertain
step
toward
the
mouth
of
the
cave
jarrold
moved
at
her
side
she
went
faster
he
put
his
hand
on
her
did
you
hear
what
he
said
he
asked
she
tried
to
break
away
and
run
he
held
her
one
clear
thought
and
only
one
formed
in
her
mind
as
she
had
never
longed
for
anything
in
her
life
she
yearned
for
mark
king
mark
she
screamed
mark
king
save
me
jarrold
clapped
a
big
dirty
hand
over
her
mouth
he
put
a
wiry
arm
about
her
and
lifted
her
and
carried
her
back
to
the
fireside
none
of
that
he
growled
in
her
ear
she
shrank
away
as
she
felt
the
tensing
of
his
arm
and
was
conscious
of
the
contact
of
his
body
she
grew
silent
cowering
she
heard
a
sound
of
something
dragging
and
could
not
hide
her
fascinated
eyes
thus
she
watched
as
brodie
gripped
the
slack
of
gratton
coat
shoulders
and
shoved
the
body
out
into
the
snow
she
even
marked
how
the
living
man
spat
after
the
dead
go
to
the
coyotes
he
muttered
they
your
kind
gloria
knew
that
if
she
took
a
step
jarrold
would
clutch
her
again
so
she
stood
very
still
brodie
came
back
and
threw
some
wood
on
the
fire
and
squatted
down
over
the
provisions
seeming
to
be
taking
stock
of
them
perhaps
he
was
but
strengthening
his
heart
digesting
the
evidence
of
the
case
assuring
himself
again
after
the
accomplished
fact
that
the
deed
was
just
still
squatting
he
drank
again
this
time
from
the
bottle
which
had
been
gratton
as
he
tilted
it
up
she
saw
that
it
was
full
when
he
put
it
down
with
a
long
sigh
and
wiped
his
wet
mouth
it
was
not
over
he
brooded
over
the
fire
he
gave
no
sign
of
noticing
her
let
me
go
she
said
to
jarrold
i
am
sick
i
die
here
please
let
me
go
jarrold
shifted
and
looked
to
his
companions
benny
shook
his
head
there
ai
no
hurry
he
stated
judicially
what
sort
is
she
steve
she
come
up
to
gaynor
place
along
with
gratton
answered
jarrold
as
though
he
knew
all
about
her
he
was
crazy
gone
on
her
crazy
enough
to
want
to
marry
her
even
sent
me
for
the
judge
then
mark
king
showed
up
she
fell
for
him
and
gave
gratton
the
then
she
comes
into
the
mountains
with
king
i
guess
next
she
gets
tired
of
him
and
goes
back
to
gratton
woman
asked
benny
jarrold
nodded
benny
clacked
his
tongue
brodie
still
brooded
at
his
fire
his
eyes
sullen
upon
the
fitful
flame
and
red
embers
where
is
king
asked
brodie
where
is
king
repeated
jarrold
to
gloria
i
do
know
she
answered
speaking
with
difficulty
i
oh
for
god
sake
let
me
go
i
wo
say
anything
about
what
i
saw
i
promise
if
you
will
only
let
me
go
they
promise
easy
and
break
promises
easier
said
jarrold
benny
came
up
and
touched
brodie
on
the
shoulder
the
squatting
man
started
and
scowled
benny
stooped
and
whispered
brodie
got
up
heavily
and
together
the
two
withdrew
going
further
back
in
the
cave
they
talked
but
gloria
could
not
catch
the
words
she
saw
the
flare
of
one
match
after
the
other
as
they
fell
to
smoking
the
smell
of
strong
tobacco
came
to
her
she
looked
appealingly
to
jarrold
he
sidled
closer
standing
between
her
and
the
open
i
pay
you
a
thousand
dollars
when
i
get
back
to
san
francisco
she
whispered
eagerly
ten
thousand
if
you
let
me
go
now
jarrold
pondered
his
stupid
little
eyes
steady
and
unwinking
on
her
a
thousand
dollars
he
returned
slowly
would
do
me
any
good
if
i
never
got
it
as
i
would
if
none
of
us
got
clear
of
this
damn
snow
neither
would
ten
i
and
it
would
do
me
any
good
if
benny
and
brodie
shot
me
full
of
lead
and
it
would
be
much
anyhow
if
we
got
away
with
what
we
found
everything
being
as
it
is
i
ai
half
as
strong
for
a
thousand
dollars
nor
yet
ten
right
now
as
i
am
for
you
and
you
know
it
do
you
he
tried
to
ogle
her
and
her
sick
dread
nearly
overwhelmed
her
and
you
got
sense
too
went
on
jarrold
leering
meaningly
it
be
bad
to
have
a
man
stuck
on
you
that
got
all
kind
of
kale
will
it
girlie
as
he
poured
out
his
wretched
insinuations
she
was
trembling
in
her
heart
she
thought
that
she
had
spoken
truly
and
would
die
if
they
kept
her
here
i
am
married
to
king
she
said
as
steadily
as
she
could
i
want
to
go
to
him
you
have
no
right
to
keep
me
here
but
you
do
even
know
where
he
is
jarrold
reminded
her
slyly
brodie
and
benny
had
given
over
their
whispering
and
came
back
to
the
fire
where
brail
and
the
italian
looked
up
at
them
sharply
here
was
another
guarded
conference
among
the
four
gloria
though
she
could
watch
them
was
unable
to
hear
what
they
were
saying
jarrold
began
to
grow
uneasy
so
soon
is
distrust
bred
amongst
those
who
have
found
treasure
brodie
made
a
last
remark
and
laughed
the
others
laughed
after
him
and
the
four
looked
toward
jarrold
and
gloria
brodie
leaning
back
caught
up
a
bottle
and
drank
and
thereafter
passed
the
bottle
to
the
man
nearest
him
gloria
was
quick
to
see
that
he
had
set
his
rifle
away
somewhere
against
the
rock
wall
in
the
shadows
only
brail
still
clung
to
his
gun
if
he
should
set
it
aside
if
there
should
come
a
moment
when
she
could
slip
to
the
cave
mouth
in
the
outside
dark
despite
the
deep
snow
she
would
at
least
have
a
chance
to
escape
from
them
even
though
she
had
nowhere
to
go
she
longed
wildly
to
be
away
from
them
when
their
eyes
roved
toward
her
she
thought
that
she
would
rather
be
dead
out
in
the
clean
white
snow
than
here
she
wondered
if
these
men
were
as
utterly
callous
as
they
seemed
gratton
so
newly
dead
appeared
forgotten
they
laughed
and
drank
they
smoked
and
spat
they
soiled
her
with
their
eyes
and
their
talk
quite
as
though
they
had
neither
knowledge
nor
memory
of
manslaughter
done
benny
alone
for
a
brief
period
appeared
nervous
she
wondered
what
he
was
doing
he
had
rolled
back
his
he
was
jabbing
at
his
bare
forearm
with
something
which
now
and
then
caught
and
reflected
the
firelight
after
a
long
time
she
heard
a
long
sigh
from
benny
he
pulled
down
his
the
others
laughed
again
it
time
we
had
a
little
talk
said
brodie
out
of
a
short
silence
without
anybody
skirt
listening
in
leave
her
back
there
further
from
the
front
door
jarrold
where
she
ca
get
an
earful
and
where
she
ca
make
a
getaway
you
come
on
over
here
a
minute
gloria
made
no
resistance
but
sank
down
limply
where
jarrold
left
her
and
watched
him
as
he
slouched
over
to
the
fire
she
sought
to
hear
their
words
to
read
the
looks
on
their
faces
but
she
caught
only
a
monotonous
mutter
unintelligible
but
evil
and
saw
only
the
bottle
passing
from
one
to
the
other
brodie
finished
it
and
hurled
it
from
him
so
that
it
broke
noisily
a
few
times
she
heard
them
laugh
she
could
distinguish
brodie
throaty
bull
tone
and
benny
nervous
cackle
jarrold
did
not
appear
made
for
mirth
and
him
she
feared
most
of
all
yes
even
more
than
brodie
whom
she
had
seen
do
murder
and
benny
who
she
knew
had
done
murder
brail
and
the
italian
said
little
they
were
men
to
follow
where
other
men
led
she
fancied
that
several
times
steve
jarrold
little
eyes
left
the
bottle
the
faces
of
his
companions
and
even
the
pile
of
gold
to
quest
for
her
face
in
the
dark
come
here
commanded
brodie
she
started
he
was
calling
to
her
she
got
up
and
moved
forward
slowly
it
was
obey
or
be
dragged
to
him
in
the
pale
light
by
the
fire
standing
so
that
the
blaze
was
between
the
five
men
and
herself
she
stopped
until
now
she
had
been
very
white
suddenly
she
knew
that
her
face
must
be
flooded
with
bright
red
she
could
feel
the
burn
of
it
the
eyes
of
the
men
seemed
veritably
to
disregard
her
clothes
to
make
her
feel
another
lady
godiva
gratton
then
king
then
gratton
again
brodie
chuckled
i
do
care
whose
before
gratton
the
first
time
but
whose
after
gratton
the
last
time
that
it
who
are
you
for
me
or
steve
no
she
cried
her
hands
at
her
breast
no
i
am
not
like
that
i
was
not
gratton
i
am
i
am
mark
king
wife
so
admitted
brodie
well
that
cuts
no
ice
open
and
shut
you
gone
back
to
gratton
now
come
over
here
closer
i
wo
she
shuddered
you
do
dare
make
me
i
oh
wo
you
let
me
go
you
have
your
gold
there
you
have
gold
and
whiskey
you
do
want
me
whiskey
gold
and
women
muttered
brodie
they
go
together
fine
and
quit
that
little
schoolgirl
dodge
you
make
me
sick
if
you
was
what
you
are
you
would
be
where
you
are
come
over
here
and
give
us
a
kiss
he
jerked
from
his
pocket
a
dull
lump
one
of
the
smaller
richer
nuggets
i
no
pincher
come
across
and
i
give
you
a
whole
handful
of
gold
his
tone
was
playful
but
jarrold
cut
in
less
playfully
leave
her
alone
brodie
he
advised
she
do
cotton
to
you
and
what
more
whose
gold
is
it
anyhow
we
ai
divided
yet
and
she
well
if
she
belongs
to
anybody
she
mine
so
brodie
monosyllable
was
expressionless
well
i
was
asking
and
she
ai
answered
yet
fast
as
the
girl
heart
beat
her
thoughts
sought
to
fly
faster
these
men
were
brutes
here
she
began
and
alas
here
she
ended
she
had
never
known
what
brute
meant
she
had
called
mark
king
that
and
now
if
only
mark
king
could
hear
her
call
could
come
to
her
but
that
was
less
thought
than
prayer
these
were
brute
beasts
their
bestiality
when
they
had
first
come
upon
her
was
terrifying
now
as
the
alcohol
burned
in
their
stomachs
and
the
further
intoxication
of
gold
crept
into
their
blood
her
terror
was
boundless
in
a
moment
she
would
feel
upon
her
either
the
hands
of
brodie
or
the
hands
of
jarrold
and
she
was
helpless
and
hopeless
until
since
life
connotes
hope
there
came
a
faint
flicker
of
light
and
with
it
came
a
sudden
compelling
swift
longing
if
she
might
set
them
to
quarrelling
over
her
to
send
a
snarling
man
at
a
snarling
man
throat
her
hands
dropped
to
her
sides
and
were
clenched
she
lifted
her
chin
with
all
that
strength
that
lay
in
the
innermost
soul
of
gloria
king
she
strove
to
drive
her
great
fear
out
of
her
eyes
to
hide
it
from
their
wolfish
regard
to
summon
up
in
its
stead
a
mocking
inscrutability
there
was
but
one
thing
left
to
do
but
one
part
to
play
oh
god
if
she
could
play
the
part
she
stood
motionless
silent
she
battled
with
herself
she
struggled
mightily
for
a
calm
utterance
and
in
the
end
she
said
in
a
tone
which
she
managed
to
make
full
of
challenge
which
of
you
is
the
better
man
they
stared
at
her
all
of
them
puzzled
by
her
change
of
attitude
as
by
her
words
then
brodie
with
a
noisy
explosion
of
laughter
smote
his
thigh
and
after
him
benny
giggled
foolishly
the
better
man
brodie
shouted
hear
her
steve
old
horse
the
better
man
he
lunged
to
his
feet
he
stood
solidly
unswerving
though
more
than
ever
slow
and
ponderous
i
go
you
steve
the
right
she
goes
to
the
man
who
man
enough
to
get
her
that
big
swen
brodie
the
best
man
in
these
mountains
i
go
you
for
her
steve
by
god
she
worth
it
too
but
steve
jarrold
sat
where
he
was
glaring
she
sly
he
grunted
cursing
before
and
after
ca
you
see
what
she
up
to
she
wants
us
to
fight
one
another
she
be
glad
if
we
both
killed
one
another
you
do
understand
women
brodie
they
sly
like
cats
make
a
auction
it
was
benny
mirthful
suggestion
why
just
you
two
guys
anyway
where
do
you
get
that
stuff
free
for
all
what
i
say
he
waved
his
bottle
auction
her
off
that
what
i
say
i
give
a
bottle
of
whiskey
for
her
hey
brodie
brodie
had
laughed
when
jarrold
spoke
he
laughed
now
but
he
looked
to
jarrold
and
not
benny
as
he
spoke
he
extended
his
great
hands
the
fingers
crooked
curving
slowly
inward
like
steel
hooks
i
can
eat
you
alive
and
you
know
it
steve
he
mocked
what
more
knows
it
that
what
she
wants
she
picked
me
steve
just
her
way
of
letting
you
down
easy
she
do
aim
to
hurt
your
feelings
will
you
come
on
and
take
a
fall
for
her
or
is
the
lady
mine
what
the
word
speak
up
man
gloria
saw
that
jarrold
though
he
sent
a
black
scowling
look
at
the
bigger
man
was
afraid
and
yet
they
must
fight
they
must
be
driven
to
blows
she
must
somehow
set
them
at
each
others
throats
it
was
so
hard
to
think
at
all
yet
she
could
think
forward
to
one
occurrence
only
that
could
give
her
respite
and
a
frail
chance
for
freedom
if
they
would
only
fight
as
in
some
dim
instinctive
way
it
was
given
her
to
understand
that
such
men
would
fight
once
a
wrathful
blow
had
been
given
and
taken
if
the
others
would
only
watch
them
and
not
her
if
she
could
come
to
one
of
the
rifles
or
outside
she
turned
to
jarrold
she
gathered
herself
for
the
final
supreme
effort
she
made
her
eyes
grow
bright
through
sheer
force
of
will
she
made
her
lips
cease
trembling
and
curve
to
a
smile
at
the
man
she
even
concealed
her
loathing
and
put
a
ringing
note
almost
of
laughter
into
her
voice
as
she
said
softly
i
know
you
are
not
afraid
and
i
think
yes
i
am
sure
that
you
could
whip
him
steve
jarrold
eyes
flashed
then
they
left
hers
lingeringly
brodie
was
stamping
impatiently
calling
to
him
take
her
snapped
jarrold
hell
take
both
of
you
the
laughter
and
challenge
went
out
of
swen
brodie
bloodshot
eyes
a
new
red
surged
all
of
a
sudden
into
them
he
turned
and
came
slowly
about
the
fire
his
arms
still
uplifted
the
crooking
fingers
toward
gloria
scream
after
scream
burst
from
gloria
lips
taut
nerves
seemed
to
snap
all
through
her
body
like
violin
strings
she
ran
ran
anywhere
ran
blindly
she
ran
into
benny
who
clutched
at
her
she
fled
away
from
him
back
toward
the
darker
end
of
the
cave
the
low
rumble
of
a
man
laughter
answered
her
drunken
laughter
from
brodie
whether
drunk
with
whiskey
or
with
gold
or
with
lust
did
not
matter
drunk
he
was
gloria
shriek
rose
like
a
madwoman
brodie
thick
laughter
was
its
sinister
echo
another
man
called
out
something
the
slow
heavy
feet
of
swen
brodie
were
following
following
boots
scuffling
brodie
pursuing
with
a
wide
patient
grin
he
was
in
no
hurry
he
was
so
sure
of
her
his
hands
were
almost
on
her
gloria
whipped
aside
and
ran
again
he
kept
between
her
and
the
front
of
the
cave
with
all
of
his
grinning
patience
he
was
as
watchful
as
a
cat
she
was
driven
back
and
back
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
narrowing
tunnel
he
came
on
he
would
be
upon
her
in
another
slow
ponderous
strides
she
could
not
pass
him
she
could
not
dart
forward
and
out
his
arms
were
widely
extended
on
either
side
he
was
expecting
that
she
could
only
save
herself
from
him
second
by
second
and
the
seconds
were
running
out
swiftly
she
prayed
to
god
in
wild
passionate
supplication
she
prayed
for
sudden
death
death
before
those
horrid
crooked
fingers
touched
her
but
while
she
prayed
to
god
it
was
of
mark
king
that
she
thought
and
mark
king
because
of
her
usage
of
him
was
miles
and
miles
away
so
far
that
her
despairing
shrieks
died
without
penetrating
part
of
the
empty
wastes
across
which
he
had
trudged
and
still
she
drew
back
and
back
and
still
she
prayed
for
the
miracle
as
she
had
done
that
day
when
she
had
seen
king
coming
toward
her
with
a
rope
in
his
hand
prayed
for
the
earth
to
split
asunder
for
a
flame
to
leap
out
and
consume
the
beast
crowding
closer
upon
her
to
consume
him
or
herself
at
last
she
was
at
the
end
the
end
of
the
the
end
of
hope
brodie
came
on
his
arms
out
she
could
hear
him
breathing
she
could
smell
the
whiskey
he
reeked
with
beyond
him
she
saw
jarrold
squatting
by
the
fire
brail
leaning
on
his
rifle
guarding
the
entrance
benny
and
the
italian
lounging
in
the
shadows
figures
of
hell
watching
brodie
actions
with
aloof
interest
brodie
made
the
last
step
she
felt
his
hand
on
her
arm
closing
drawing
her
forward
the
last
agonized
shriek
burst
from
her
oh
god
oh
dear
god
she
did
not
hear
and
brodie
did
not
hearken
to
a
sudden
new
sound
in
the
cave
grown
suddenly
still
the
sound
of
a
cascade
of
loose
stones
they
came
with
a
rush
they
piled
up
near
the
middle
of
the
open
cave
dropping
from
the
shadowy
rock
roof
above
but
benny
always
on
nerve
edge
shrilled
look
out
a
she
heard
god
had
heard
better
crushed
under
a
falling
mountain
than
in
those
brute
arms
and
then
she
saw
from
ten
feet
above
straight
down
dropped
something
else
taut
nerves
of
those
who
saw
fancied
it
a
great
boulder
falling
but
no
boulder
this
which
striking
the
little
pile
of
rocks
became
animated
rose
whirled
and
mark
screamed
gloria
mark
turned
to
stone
incredulous
of
their
eyes
bewildered
beyond
the
power
to
move
were
those
who
saw
it
was
brail
who
first
understood
brail
the
one
man
with
a
gun
in
his
hands
he
whipped
it
up
and
began
firing
nervous
and
excited
it
was
after
the
second
shot
that
king
rifle
answered
him
it
roared
out
like
the
crash
of
doom
in
gloria
ears
she
saw
the
stabbing
spurt
of
fire
brail
sagged
where
he
stood
crumpled
and
pitched
forward
his
rifle
clattering
loudly
against
the
rocks
but
by
now
the
brief
stupor
that
had
locked
the
other
men
in
staring
inaction
was
gone
gloria
saw
figures
leaping
forward
she
knew
that
brodie
hands
had
relinquished
her
she
saw
brodie
bearing
down
on
king
roaring
inarticulately
as
he
went
she
saw
benny
and
jarrold
and
the
italian
bearing
down
upon
him
king
was
in
the
midst
of
all
that
they
were
upon
him
before
brail
head
had
struck
the
ground
they
gave
him
no
time
no
space
for
another
shot
he
swept
his
clubbed
rifle
high
over
his
head
she
heard
the
blow
when
he
struck
the
hideous
sound
of
a
crushing
skull
a
man
went
down
she
did
not
know
which
one
only
it
was
not
mark
thank
god
it
was
not
mark
king
and
now
king
had
a
little
room
and
an
instant
of
his
own
as
two
other
men
swerved
widely
about
the
falling
figure
he
fired
again
not
putting
the
rifle
to
his
shoulder
another
man
fell
lay
screaming
rolled
aside
was
forgotten
where
my
rifle
brodie
was
yelling
he
could
find
it
in
the
dark
he
could
stop
to
grope
for
it
but
gloria
knew
she
remembered
she
ran
for
it
found
it
straightened
up
with
it
in
her
shaking
hands
again
king
was
using
his
weapon
as
a
club
since
they
pressed
him
so
closely
again
came
that
terrible
sound
steve
jarrold
it
was
who
went
down
and
with
it
another
sound
that
of
hard
wood
splintering
the
rifle
was
broken
over
his
head
the
stock
whirled
close
to
gloria
king
had
only
the
short
heavy
steel
barrel
in
his
hands
benny
had
circled
to
the
far
side
brodie
had
caught
up
a
great
thick
limb
of
wood
they
were
coming
at
king
from
two
sides
at
once
gloria
tried
to
aim
pulled
the
trigger
tugging
frantically
only
then
she
remembered
to
draw
the
hammer
back
it
was
brodie
ancient
rifle
and
she
struggled
to
get
it
cocked
she
shuddered
at
the
report
the
bullet
sang
in
front
of
benny
and
he
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
he
was
near
the
cave
mouth
gloria
pointed
forgot
the
hammer
remembered
got
the
gun
cocked
and
fired
again
benny
plunged
wildly
forward
she
did
not
know
if
she
had
hit
him
he
hurled
himself
headlong
toward
the
narrow
exit
and
through
she
had
forgotten
brodie
and
king
she
turned
toward
them
she
did
not
dare
shoot
now
king
was
in
the
way
he
moved
aside
as
if
he
understood
her
trouble
brodie
grown
unthinkably
quick
of
foot
moved
with
him
brodie
too
understood
she
saw
him
leap
in
and
strike
the
blow
landed
a
glancing
blow
king
seemed
to
have
grown
tired
he
moved
so
slowly
but
he
did
move
and
toward
brodie
he
swung
his
clubbed
and
beat
at
brodie
great
face
with
it
beat
and
missed
and
almost
fell
forward
again
brodie
struck
again
king
beat
at
him
they
moved
up
and
down
back
and
forth
brodie
was
cursing
under
his
breath
and
at
last
jeering
king
was
moving
more
and
more
slowly
his
left
arm
swung
as
if
it
were
useless
brodie
swept
up
his
club
in
both
hands
grunting
audibly
with
every
blow
oh
if
she
could
only
shoot
if
she
only
dared
shoot
but
brodie
nimble
on
his
feet
that
had
been
so
patiently
slow
just
now
kept
king
always
in
front
of
him
between
him
and
gloria
rifle
i
get
you
king
i
get
you
shouted
brodie
his
voice
exulting
i
always
wanted
to
get
you
right
there
was
a
crash
the
splintering
of
wood
against
steel
both
men
had
struck
together
brodie
club
had
broken
to
splinters
and
the
in
king
hands
flew
out
of
his
grip
and
across
the
cave
ringing
out
as
it
struck
the
two
men
their
hands
empty
stood
a
moment
staring
at
each
other
then
brodie
shouted
a
great
shout
of
triumph
and
sprang
forward
and
mark
king
steadying
himself
ignoring
the
hot
trickle
of
blood
down
his
side
where
benny
second
bullet
had
torn
his
flesh
met
him
with
a
cry
that
was
like
brodie
own
in
his
hot
brain
there
was
no
thought
of
handicap
of
odds
of
brodie
advantage
there
was
only
the
mad
rage
which
had
hurled
him
here
one
man
against
five
in
a
girl
defence
that
and
a
raving
unleashed
blood
lust
the
desire
overshadowing
all
else
to
have
brodie
brute
throat
in
his
hands
to
batter
brodie
brute
face
into
the
rocks
they
met
in
their
onrush
like
two
bodies
hurled
from
catapults
they
struck
and
grappled
and
fell
and
rolled
together
one
now
as
they
strove
locked
in
the
embrace
of
death
an
embrace
in
which
brodie
was
the
greater
weight
the
greater
girth
the
greater
strength
and
mark
king
the
greater
sheer
clean
manhood
gloria
ran
toward
them
the
rifle
shaking
in
her
hands
brodie
feared
her
and
strove
to
turn
and
twist
so
that
she
could
not
shoot
king
saw
her
and
shouted
in
a
terrible
voice
which
was
not
like
mark
voice
do
shoot
let
me
she
did
not
heed
she
would
shoot
if
ever
she
could
be
sure
that
she
would
not
shoot
him
but
she
did
not
dare
they
thrashed
about
so
madly
they
were
like
octopuses
in
mortal
combat
their
arms
flailing
seemed
more
than
four
arms
brodie
had
his
hands
at
king
throat
king
hands
were
at
throat
she
saw
brodie
bestial
face
gloating
he
was
so
confident
now
she
saw
his
great
hands
shut
down
sinking
into
the
flesh
king
face
when
she
got
one
swift
glimpse
of
it
was
set
void
of
expression
king
hands
with
tendons
bursting
sank
deeper
and
deeper
then
she
understood
that
each
man
had
the
grip
that
he
wanted
that
it
was
a
mere
matter
now
of
strength
and
endurance
and
will
and
that
glorious
thing
sheer
clean
manhood
they
were
breathing
terribly
they
lay
stiller
stiller
they
did
not
thrash
about
so
much
their
eyes
were
starting
out
of
their
sockets
their
faces
were
turning
purple
or
was
it
the
firelight
men
faces
could
not
look
like
that
not
while
the
men
lived
they
gasped
now
they
did
not
breathe
one
of
brodie
hands
came
away
hastily
he
began
battering
at
face
battering
like
a
the
blows
sounded
loudly
blood
broke
out
under
the
terrific
pounding
king
grip
did
not
alter
did
not
shift
his
eyes
were
shut
but
he
clung
on
grim
looking
a
dead
man
but
a
man
whose
will
lasted
on
after
death
brodie
wrenched
they
rolled
over
still
king
hands
did
not
leave
their
grip
they
were
on
their
feet
staggering
up
and
down
two
men
moulded
together
like
one
man
brodie
struck
blow
after
blow
and
with
every
thud
gloria
winced
and
felt
a
pain
through
her
own
body
and
still
king
held
his
grip
both
hands
sunk
deep
into
the
thick
throat
they
were
apart
two
blind
staggering
men
what
parted
them
they
did
not
know
and
gloria
could
not
see
thus
they
stood
for
a
second
only
brodie
lifted
his
hands
weak
hands
rising
slowly
slowly
uncertainly
king
saw
him
through
a
gathering
mist
brodie
opened
his
mouth
to
draw
in
great
sobbing
breaths
of
air
king
the
primal
rage
upon
him
saw
the
great
double
teeth
bared
and
thought
that
his
enemy
was
laughing
at
him
it
was
king
who
gathered
himself
first
and
struck
first
all
of
the
will
he
had
all
of
the
endurance
left
in
his
battered
body
all
of
the
strength
god
gave
him
he
put
into
that
blow
he
struck
brodie
full
in
the
face
between
the
little
battered
blue
eyes
and
brodie
fell
he
rose
he
got
to
his
knees
and
sagged
up
and
forward
king
shout
then
was
to
ring
through
gloria
memory
for
days
to
come
he
bore
down
on
swen
brodie
caught
him
about
the
great
body
lifted
him
clear
of
the
floor
and
hurled
him
downward
brodie
struck
heavily
his
head
against
the
rocks
and
where
he
fell
he
lay
stunned
or
dead
come
said
king
to
gloria
come
quick
he
turned
toward
the
cave
mouth
and
with
one
hand
began
to
drag
away
the
stones
so
that
they
could
go
out
his
other
hand
was
pressed
to
his
side
his
work
done
he
picked
up
the
rifle
at
his
feet
and
went
out
gloria
swaying
and
stumbling
came
after
him
neither
spoke
a
word
as
they
made
a
slow
way
through
the
snow
king
went
unsteadily
with
dragging
feet
they
climbed
the
cliff
laboriously
they
were
in
their
cave
it
was
like
home
she
dropped
down
on
the
stumbling
to
them
in
the
dark
gloria
did
not
know
if
she
had
slept
or
fainted
when
she
regained
consciousness
though
it
was
pitch
dark
and
dead
still
there
was
no
first
puzzled
moment
of
uncertainty
that
last
wonderfully
glad
thought
which
had
filled
brain
and
heart
when
she
sank
down
on
her
had
persisted
throughout
her
moments
or
hours
of
unconsciousness
pervading
her
subconscious
self
gloriously
flowering
spontaneously
in
an
awakening
mind
mark
king
had
come
back
to
her
in
her
moment
of
peril
he
had
battled
for
her
like
the
hero
that
he
was
he
had
saved
her
and
had
brought
her
home
back
home
she
had
prayed
to
god
when
utter
undoing
seemed
inevitable
when
death
had
seemed
more
desirable
than
life
and
he
had
answered
he
had
sent
mark
king
to
her
she
was
saved
and
though
it
was
cold
and
dark
and
still
she
felt
her
heart
singing
within
her
having
lived
through
all
that
she
had
endured
having
been
brought
safely
through
it
she
was
as
confident
of
the
future
as
though
never
had
evil
menaced
her
she
felt
new
strength
coursing
through
her
blood
new
hope
rising
within
her
new
certainty
that
all
was
right
with
her
and
mark
king
that
all
would
be
right
eternally
terror
and
anguish
and
despair
that
had
surged
over
her
in
so
many
great
flooding
waves
now
receded
and
were
gone
in
their
place
shone
the
great
flame
of
life
triumphant
she
thrilled
through
with
the
largeness
of
life
never
thank
god
would
she
forget
how
mark
king
forgetful
of
self
contemptuous
of
the
frightful
odds
against
him
had
hurled
himself
into
the
midst
of
those
drunken
brutes
never
would
she
forget
how
godlike
he
had
stood
forth
in
her
eyes
as
those
others
leaped
upon
him
and
he
beat
them
back
forgetful
of
self
he
had
always
been
forgetful
of
self
she
could
not
think
of
him
as
she
had
ever
thought
of
any
other
man
she
had
ever
known
for
what
other
man
would
have
come
to
her
as
he
had
done
courting
death
gladly
if
only
he
could
stand
between
her
and
the
hideous
thing
that
attacked
her
the
rush
of
great
events
had
swept
her
mind
clear
of
pettiness
and
prejudice
they
bore
her
on
from
familiar
and
to
new
levels
like
roaring
winds
out
of
a
tempestuous
north
they
cleared
away
the
wretched
fogs
that
had
enwrapped
a
girl
they
made
her
see
a
man
in
the
naked
glory
of
his
sheer
clean
manhood
to
her
now
he
stood
forth
clothed
in
magnificence
she
could
think
upon
him
only
in
superlatives
he
was
fearless
and
he
was
unselfish
he
was
kind
and
generous
and
as
as
god
own
clear
sunshine
she
knew
now
suddenly
and
for
the
first
time
because
he
had
shown
her
what
the
simple
word
meant
how
far
apart
he
stood
from
such
as
brodie
the
beast
how
high
above
such
as
gratton
and
once
in
the
city
she
had
been
ashamed
of
him
and
had
turned
to
gratton
because
he
had
appeared
to
her
without
just
so
much
black
cloth
upon
his
back
cut
in
just
such
a
style
and
now
how
bitterly
she
was
ashamed
of
her
shame
but
for
only
an
instant
thereafter
she
forgot
shame
of
any
sort
and
exulted
in
her
pride
of
him
and
in
her
pride
that
she
was
proud
yes
in
glad
defiance
of
a
gloria
that
had
been
she
was
proud
of
the
manhood
of
a
man
who
had
beaten
her
he
had
been
right
he
had
done
that
as
the
last
argument
with
an
selfish
girl
who
deserved
no
better
at
his
hands
a
girl
who
had
been
like
the
gratton
whom
she
so
abhorred
and
despised
despised
even
in
death
she
had
been
like
gratton
the
cowardly
contemptible
petty
selfish
dishonourable
all
along
mark
king
had
been
right
and
she
had
been
wrong
at
every
step
he
had
been
gentle
and
patient
after
a
fashion
which
now
set
her
wondering
and
in
the
end
lifted
him
to
new
heights
in
her
esteem
when
without
loving
him
she
had
lied
with
her
eyes
and
married
him
that
had
been
a
gratton
sort
of
trick
like
stealing
his
partners
food
loving
no
thank
god
not
that
she
had
always
loved
him
she
loved
him
now
with
her
whole
heart
and
soul
with
an
adoration
she
had
saved
for
him
when
in
the
springtime
she
had
ridden
with
him
through
the
when
their
hands
had
touched
when
he
had
held
her
in
his
arms
when
she
had
seen
him
that
first
time
from
the
stairway
and
had
looked
down
into
his
clear
eyes
and
through
them
into
his
heart
she
had
always
loved
him
she
wanted
suddenly
to
go
to
him
to
slip
into
his
arms
to
make
herself
humble
in
pleading
for
his
forgiveness
she
was
not
afraid
that
he
would
not
forgive
he
was
so
big
of
heart
that
he
would
understand
mark
she
called
softly
in
the
utter
dark
she
could
see
nothing
the
absolute
stillness
was
unbroken
she
called
anxiously
mark
where
are
you
there
was
no
answer
she
sprang
up
and
called
to
him
over
and
over
when
still
there
was
no
reply
she
began
a
hurried
search
for
a
match
there
were
still
some
upon
the
rock
shelf
then
it
was
that
she
stumbled
over
something
sprawling
on
the
floor
mark
she
cried
again
oh
mark
she
found
a
match
she
got
some
dry
twigs
blazing
in
their
light
she
saw
him
he
lay
on
his
back
like
a
dead
man
his
arms
outflung
his
white
face
turned
up
toward
hers
there
was
a
great
smear
of
blood
across
his
brow
the
track
of
a
bloody
hand
as
it
had
sought
to
wipe
a
gathering
dimness
out
of
his
eyes
the
fire
burned
brighter
she
saw
it
glisten
upon
a
little
pool
of
blood
at
her
side
she
knelt
and
bent
over
him
scarcely
breathing
if
he
were
dead
if
after
all
this
mark
king
were
dead
his
eyes
were
closed
his
face
was
deathly
white
looking
the
more
ghastly
from
the
dark
stain
across
it
she
lifted
her
own
hand
that
had
touched
his
side
and
looked
at
it
with
wide
frightened
eyes
it
too
was
red
at
that
moment
king
face
was
no
ghastlier
than
hers
for
a
little
while
she
sat
motionless
her
brain
reeling
but
almost
immediately
her
brain
cleared
and
there
stood
forth
as
in
a
white
light
the
one
thought
king
was
about
to
die
and
he
must
not
for
he
was
mark
king
valiant
and
full
of
vigour
and
vitality
a
man
strong
and
hardy
and
lusty
a
man
who
would
not
be
beaten
he
was
the
victor
not
the
vanquished
and
further
she
gloria
king
mark
king
wife
would
not
let
him
die
he
was
hers
her
own
she
would
hold
him
back
to
her
had
he
not
come
to
her
when
she
needed
him
and
done
his
uttermost
for
her
if
now
she
was
filled
with
life
and
the
pulsating
love
of
life
it
was
his
doing
and
now
it
was
her
task
her
glorious
privilege
to
do
for
him
to
fight
for
him
ignoring
the
odds
against
her
to
save
him
she
sprang
up
filled
with
stubborn
confident
determination
he
was
hers
and
she
would
not
let
him
die
she
had
learned
to
fight
she
had
fought
against
gratton
against
brodie
she
would
fight
as
she
had
never
done
until
now
against
death
itself
he
was
big
and
she
little
yet
she
dragged
his
bed
close
to
his
side
and
got
her
arms
about
him
and
lifted
him
enough
to
get
him
upon
the
blankets
she
ran
to
her
fire
and
piled
and
piled
wood
on
it
until
the
flames
roared
noisily
and
brightened
everything
about
her
she
ran
back
to
him
and
knelt
again
and
slipped
her
hand
inside
his
shirt
seeking
his
heart
the
deep
chest
was
barely
warmer
than
death
the
heart
stirred
only
faintly
but
it
did
beat
she
sought
the
wound
bullet
had
made
and
found
it
in
his
side
there
was
blood
on
her
hands
but
she
did
not
notice
it
now
she
found
where
the
bullet
had
entered
and
where
it
had
torn
its
way
out
through
his
flesh
she
did
not
know
if
any
vital
organ
lay
in
that
narrow
span
or
if
any
major
artery
had
been
severed
or
if
the
had
merely
glanced
along
the
ribs
and
been
deflected
by
them
she
only
knew
that
he
had
lost
much
blood
that
it
must
have
gushed
freely
while
he
strove
with
swen
brodie
and
that
now
it
must
be
stopped
utterly
there
seemed
to
be
so
little
blood
left
in
the
pale
battered
body
she
did
see
how
in
the
intense
cold
it
had
coagulated
over
the
wounds
checking
its
own
flow
but
she
did
not
mean
for
him
to
lose
another
precious
drop
and
then
it
was
that
hands
achieved
the
first
really
important
work
they
had
ever
done
in
her
life
she
tore
bits
away
from
her
own
and
made
soft
pads
over
each
wound
with
their
she
cut
a
long
strip
from
a
blanket
this
she
wound
about
his
limp
body
making
a
long
tight
bandage
all
this
time
he
had
not
moved
she
had
to
bend
close
to
be
sure
that
he
still
breathed
she
got
snow
and
wiped
his
face
clean
of
blood
touching
the
closed
eyelids
gently
when
still
the
eyes
remained
shut
and
he
looked
like
one
already
dead
she
longed
wildly
for
some
stimulant
there
was
coffee
she
would
make
hot
coffee
do
she
got
the
among
the
coals
filled
it
with
snow
to
melt
recklessly
poured
coffee
into
it
then
while
she
awaited
the
slow
heating
she
returned
to
him
and
for
the
first
time
saw
how
wet
his
boots
were
she
got
the
boots
off
and
felt
his
feet
she
stooped
over
them
until
for
an
instant
she
laid
her
cheek
against
a
bare
foot
it
was
like
ice
she
recalled
how
he
had
ministered
to
her
she
heated
a
blanket
and
wrapped
it
about
his
feet
and
ankles
she
heated
other
blankets
and
put
them
about
him
the
canvas
at
the
cave
mouth
had
been
torn
down
she
got
it
back
into
place
to
make
it
warmer
for
him
she
put
fresh
wood
on
the
fire
she
hastened
the
coffee
boiling
all
that
she
could
by
placing
bits
of
dry
wood
close
all
about
the
pot
she
knelt
at
king
side
she
got
an
arm
under
his
shoulders
and
managed
to
lift
him
a
little
she
rolled
up
a
blanket
and
put
it
under
his
head
then
she
brought
the
cup
of
black
coffee
and
with
a
spoon
got
some
of
it
between
his
teeth
she
spilled
more
than
went
into
his
mouth
but
she
was
rewarded
by
seeing
the
throat
muscles
contract
as
involuntarily
he
swallowed
thus
patient
and
determined
and
very
very
gentle
with
him
she
got
several
spoonfuls
of
coffee
down
him
thereafter
she
let
him
lie
back
again
while
she
sought
to
plan
just
how
she
must
care
for
him
just
what
she
could
do
for
him
she
knew
little
of
nursing
and
yet
knew
instinctively
that
his
condition
was
precarious
that
he
must
be
kept
warm
and
still
that
what
strength
remained
in
him
must
be
saved
by
proper
nourishment
there
were
scraps
of
food
left
brodie
and
his
men
in
their
gold
fever
had
not
so
much
as
thought
to
gather
up
the
few
bits
of
scanty
provisions
she
began
taking
careful
stock
she
found
a
scrap
of
bread
that
had
been
knocked
to
the
floor
and
kicked
aside
she
picked
it
up
and
carrying
a
torch
with
her
began
seeking
any
other
fallen
morsels
in
this
search
she
came
once
to
the
hole
in
the
floor
through
which
brodie
and
the
others
had
gone
down
into
gus
ingle
and
at
its
side
she
found
something
which
at
this
moment
was
a
thousand
times
more
precious
in
her
staring
eyes
than
if
it
had
been
so
much
solid
gold
it
was
a
great
hunk
of
fresh
meat
instantly
she
knew
how
it
had
come
here
king
had
killed
his
bear
that
was
why
he
had
returned
he
had
brought
it
here
had
missed
her
had
dropped
it
here
and
then
she
understood
now
too
how
he
had
come
so
unexpectedly
into
the
lowest
cave
he
had
gone
down
through
this
hole
and
had
known
a
which
led
on
down
she
stood
by
the
hole
bending
over
it
listening
wondering
if
any
man
stirred
down
there
but
that
was
but
for
a
moment
she
caught
up
the
bear
meat
carrying
it
in
both
arms
and
hurried
back
to
her
fire
though
she
knew
little
more
of
cookery
than
of
nursing
she
set
about
the
very
sensible
task
of
making
a
strong
broth
the
proper
nourishment
that
had
seemed
so
impossible
a
moment
ago
was
now
ready
at
hand
god
is
good
she
whispered
a
sudden
new
gush
of
love
and
reverence
in
her
heart
he
will
help
me
now
for
herself
since
her
own
strength
must
be
kept
up
she
cooked
a
strip
of
the
meat
on
the
coals
then
she
went
to
king
and
for
a
long
time
sat
at
his
side
her
eyes
upon
his
white
face
her
hand
clasping
his
again
and
again
she
stooped
and
laid
her
cheek
against
the
strong
but
now
lax
fingers
once
she
put
her
lips
to
his
forehead
when
she
sat
back
her
eyes
were
wet
and
the
slow
tears
welled
up
and
trickled
unnoticed
down
her
cheeks
but
they
were
tears
which
left
the
heart
sweetened
tears
of
tenderness
of
gratitude
of
sympathy
and
love
as
the
night
wore
on
since
she
was
determined
that
king
should
not
be
chilled
her
fire
consumed
a
great
part
of
the
wood
more
wood
must
be
brought
or
in
the
morning
she
went
to
the
canvas
flap
and
looked
out
there
were
clouds
but
also
there
were
wide
rifts
through
which
the
stars
blazed
in
all
of
that
glorious
crystalline
beauty
of
the
stars
of
the
winter
sierra
while
she
stood
looking
out
the
moon
almost
at
the
full
gilded
a
cloud
edge
and
after
a
moment
broke
through
like
an
augury
of
joy
stars
and
moon
made
the
wilderness
over
into
a
land
of
fairy
at
ten
million
points
the
snow
caught
the
light
flashing
it
back
as
though
the
white
robe
spread
over
the
solitudes
were
sewn
with
gems
never
had
the
world
looked
so
white
as
now
with
a
rare
light
shining
upon
its
smooth
purity
it
was
clean
and
fresh
gloriously
spotless
where
black
shadows
lay
they
but
accentuated
the
whiteness
across
which
they
fell
out
of
this
sleeping
enchanted
land
rising
above
it
sweeping
across
it
a
low
voice
like
a
whisper
came
to
her
a
whisper
in
her
ears
that
became
a
song
in
her
heart
the
snow
that
had
clung
to
the
pines
muting
their
needles
and
stilling
their
branches
had
dropped
on
during
the
day
now
the
night
wind
which
drove
the
clouds
lingered
through
the
pine
tops
and
set
them
swaying
gently
in
the
vast
harmonic
rhythm
which
is
like
the
surging
of
a
distant
ocean
the
everlasting
whisper
of
the
pines
that
ancient
hushed
voice
which
through
the
countless
centuries
has
never
been
still
save
when
briefly
silenced
by
the
snow
which
had
borne
its
message
to
gloria
when
on
that
first
day
she
went
with
mark
king
into
the
mountains
which
many
a
time
had
mingled
with
her
fancies
tingeing
them
leading
her
to
dream
of
another
life
than
that
of
city
streets
which
now
suddenly
set
chords
vibrating
softly
in
her
own
bosom
all
these
days
it
had
been
stilled
had
it
called
her
ears
would
have
been
deaf
to
it
but
now
insistently
it
bore
a
message
to
her
such
a
message
as
from
now
on
she
would
hear
in
the
quiet
voices
of
her
little
to
her
attuned
by
those
varying
emotions
which
latterly
had
had
their
wills
with
her
it
was
the
ancient
call
the
summons
back
to
the
real
things
of
his
to
the
bigness
and
the
true
meaning
of
life
rising
in
response
to
it
awakening
in
her
own
breast
were
the
old
human
instinctive
influences
sprouting
seeds
in
the
blood
of
her
forbears
it
was
the
eternal
call
of
the
mother
earth
that
one
like
gloria
must
hear
and
hearken
to
and
understand
before
she
could
set
firm
feet
upon
the
ashes
of
a
vanquished
self
to
rise
to
the
true
things
of
womanhood
it
was
the
one
everlasting
whisper
day
and
night
repeated
so
something
hidden
go
and
find
it
go
and
look
behind
the
ranges
something
lost
behind
the
ranges
lost
and
waiting
for
you
go
gloria
understood
in
her
heart
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
white
glory
of
the
earth
to
the
bright
glory
of
the
sky
she
thanked
god
that
she
understood
benny
and
the
italian
were
still
alive
and
might
be
near
that
did
not
in
any
way
affect
the
fact
that
there
must
be
wood
brought
for
fire
she
turned
back
for
the
rifle
and
the
rope
she
saw
that
king
had
not
stirred
that
he
seemed
plunged
in
a
deep
quiet
sleep
she
stood
over
him
looking
down
at
him
with
her
love
for
him
softening
her
eyes
he
was
going
to
get
well
she
did
her
and
her
part
was
so
clearly
indicated
to
give
him
broth
and
to
keep
his
fire
going
she
did
not
hesitate
and
she
was
not
afraid
as
she
went
down
the
cliffs
she
meant
to
be
mark
king
mate
she
meant
to
be
worthy
of
being
his
mate
he
had
not
hesitated
he
had
not
been
afraid
when
one
man
against
five
he
dropped
down
into
the
lowest
cave
she
like
him
was
of
pioneer
stock
she
remembered
that
impressive
monument
to
pioneer
fortitude
which
stands
in
the
mountains
where
the
highway
runs
by
donner
lake
as
in
a
vision
she
saw
the
little
group
that
crowns
the
rugged
pile
the
woman
the
pioneer
mother
holding
her
baby
to
her
breast
pressing
on
with
her
own
mate
looking
fearlessly
ahead
daring
what
might
come
not
lagging
behind
the
man
rather
ready
to
lead
the
way
should
he
falter
it
was
a
glorious
thing
to
have
blood
like
that
in
her
veins
it
was
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
to
be
a
woman
like
that
woman
she
stepped
down
into
the
packed
snow
at
the
base
of
the
cliffs
here
she
stood
looking
up
and
down
the
gorge
for
any
sign
of
benny
or
of
the
italian
or
of
any
other
of
brodie
crowd
who
might
be
alive
and
astir
but
she
saw
no
one
even
gratton
body
where
it
had
been
tumbled
out
into
the
snow
was
hidden
she
heard
the
deep
quiet
breathing
of
the
pines
the
canon
stream
rushed
and
gurgled
and
babbled
shouting
as
it
leaped
over
fails
flinging
spray
which
the
moonlight
and
starlight
made
over
into
jewels
gloria
worked
at
her
working
in
the
snow
until
her
hands
and
feet
were
nearly
frozen
but
her
heart
was
warm
though
she
made
haste
and
was
ever
watchful
and
on
the
alert
her
mind
filled
with
such
thoughts
as
had
never
come
trooping
into
it
before
fragmentary
they
were
like
bright
bits
spinning
about
a
common
centre
she
looked
up
at
the
wide
sky
and
it
was
borne
in
upon
her
that
the
universe
was
mighty
and
wonderful
and
infinite
she
looked
into
her
own
heart
and
saw
where
she
had
been
small
and
silly
and
finite
she
saw
that
the
ridges
stretching
endlessly
were
like
a
concrete
symbol
of
that
infinity
which
extended
above
and
about
her
that
they
were
clothed
in
beauty
she
knew
that
when
mark
king
was
made
whole
again
and
had
forgiven
her
and
they
stood
together
hand
locked
in
hand
she
would
have
no
fear
any
more
for
his
mountains
but
rather
a
great
abiding
love
she
saw
that
her
life
had
been
empty
that
only
love
could
fill
it
love
and
service
such
as
she
was
rendering
pretty
clothes
dress
suits
did
not
matter
and
strong
loyal
hearts
did
matter
she
would
rather
have
mark
king
hold
her
in
his
arms
and
say
i
love
you
than
to
have
all
of
the
red
gold
in
all
of
the
world
three
times
that
night
she
made
the
trip
up
and
down
the
cliffs
bringing
wood
at
the
end
though
near
exhaustion
she
sank
down
by
the
fire
for
but
a
few
minutes
the
bear
meat
was
boiling
and
bubbling
she
poured
off
a
little
of
the
broth
cooled
it
and
then
as
she
had
given
king
the
coffee
she
forced
some
of
the
strong
soup
between
his
teeth
she
touched
his
cheek
and
dared
hope
that
it
was
not
so
icy
cold
she
chafed
his
feet
and
wrapped
them
again
in
a
not
blanket
and
then
with
all
of
her
covers
given
to
him
she
drew
a
coat
about
her
shoulders
and
sat
down
at
his
side
on
the
edge
of
his
blankets
and
here
throughout
the
night
she
sat
dozing
and
waking
rising
again
and
again
to
keep
the
fire
burning
she
started
up
to
find
it
full
day
she
had
been
asleep
her
head
against
his
knee
the
fire
was
dying
down
she
jumped
up
and
replenished
it
setting
the
broth
back
among
the
coals
king
lay
as
he
had
lain
last
night
his
continued
coma
was
like
a
profound
quiet
sleep
he
was
very
pale
and
yet
certainly
not
paler
than
when
she
had
first
looked
upon
his
face
she
went
to
the
canvas
screen
and
looked
out
the
sun
was
shining
and
oh
the
glory
of
the
sun
after
these
long
dark
days
the
sky
was
a
deep
serene
perfect
blue
the
snow
shone
and
glittered
and
sparkled
everywhere
down
in
the
gorge
she
saw
a
little
bird
in
quick
flight
it
skimmed
the
water
it
lighted
on
a
rock
in
the
spray
it
put
back
its
head
and
seemed
to
be
bursting
with
a
joy
of
song
a
a
friend
from
out
a
happy
past
to
gloria
it
seemed
that
the
world
was
full
of
promise
all
day
long
she
ministered
to
king
going
back
and
forth
tirelessly
since
love
and
hope
inspired
every
step
she
made
none
of
brodie
men
had
come
she
felt
a
strange
confidence
that
they
would
not
come
they
were
afraid
of
king
as
jackals
are
afraid
of
a
lion
further
they
did
not
know
that
he
was
wounded
she
thought
little
of
them
having
much
else
to
think
of
she
wound
king
watch
guessing
at
the
time
she
judged
it
sensible
to
force
a
little
nourishment
upon
him
at
regular
intervals
and
brought
him
his
broth
every
two
hours
at
a
little
before
noon
gloria
stooping
over
the
fire
started
erect
and
whirled
about
king
eyes
were
open
she
ran
to
him
dropping
on
her
knees
beside
him
catching
up
his
hand
whispering
mark
oh
mark
thank
god
he
looked
at
her
strangely
there
was
a
puzzled
bewildered
expression
in
his
eyes
he
strove
to
move
and
again
looked
at
her
with
that
strange
bewilderment
she
saw
his
lips
move
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
ask
something
and
deserted
now
by
all
of
that
magnificent
strength
on
which
he
had
always
leaned
was
as
weak
as
a
baby
do
try
to
talk
mark
she
cried
softly
please
not
yet
you
are
better
everything
is
all
right
she
gave
his
hand
a
last
squeeze
and
hurried
back
to
the
fire
his
eyes
still
followed
her
curiously
she
came
back
to
him
with
cup
and
spoon
this
he
could
understand
he
opened
his
lips
for
the
spoon
he
accepted
what
she
gave
him
and
when
she
had
finished
lay
looking
up
at
her
wonderingly
you
must
talk
mark
she
commanded
him
gently
as
again
she
knelt
by
him
you
are
getting
so
much
stronger
i
tell
you
everything
it
was
last
night
you
have
been
unconscious
ever
since
none
of
the
other
men
have
been
near
i
have
even
seen
one
of
them
she
saw
his
eyes
clear
mark
she
whispered
we
are
safe
here
because
because
you
are
so
wonderful
you
were
like
a
god
the
bravest
noblest
best
man
in
all
the
world
you
came
in
time
you
saved
me
mark
they
had
not
put
hand
upon
me
and
i
am
well
and
strong
now
i
am
going
to
take
care
of
you
you
must
just
lie
still
and
get
well
his
eyes
closed
again
he
seemed
very
faint
very
weary
hushed
she
sat
tense
her
eyes
never
moving
from
his
face
after
a
long
time
he
opened
his
eyes
again
he
tried
again
to
speak
when
the
words
did
not
come
he
managed
a
strange
shadowy
smile
with
his
bloodless
lips
and
in
another
moment
had
sunk
again
into
that
heavy
sleep
that
was
so
like
death
when
next
two
hours
later
she
again
brought
his
broth
he
stirred
at
her
touch
and
awoke
this
time
his
eyes
cleared
swiftly
he
remembered
the
other
awakening
and
her
words
he
looked
at
her
long
and
searchingly
and
she
understood
what
lay
back
of
that
look
he
was
wondering
how
she
managed
how
she
endured
to
care
for
them
both
how
without
his
active
aid
she
withstood
hardship
and
this
time
she
smiled
at
him
i
have
been
dining
sumptuously
on
bear
steaks
she
told
him
lightly
and
i
have
slept
and
kept
warm
there
has
been
no
one
near
and
the
days
are
fine
again
it
was
clear
last
night
the
sun
has
been
shining
all
day
now
when
you
had
your
own
lunch
i
tell
you
anything
you
want
to
know
only
you
must
not
try
to
talk
yet
mark
not
until
i
want
you
strong
and
well
again
you
know
it
lonesome
without
you
she
gave
him
for
the
first
time
a
whole
cup
of
broth
glorying
in
the
certainty
that
already
he
was
stronger
but
even
yet
his
weakness
was
so
great
that
before
she
had
spoken
a
dozen
sentences
he
was
asleep
again
clearly
even
to
gloria
if
but
a
little
more
blood
had
ebbed
out
of
the
wounded
side
he
would
never
have
awakened
clearly
to
gloria
triumphant
it
had
been
she
who
had
held
him
back
from
death
she
gloria
king
alone
had
fought
the
great
grim
battle
hers
was
the
victory
for
at
last
she
knew
with
her
brain
as
all
along
she
had
known
in
her
heart
that
it
was
to
be
victory
so
the
hours
passed
for
the
most
part
king
slept
lapsing
into
the
deep
stupor
of
a
drugged
man
but
at
times
he
stirred
restlessly
with
slowly
returning
strength
his
wounds
pained
him
in
his
sleep
he
muttered
gloria
watching
him
winced
as
she
saw
his
brow
contract
and
saw
how
he
tried
to
shift
his
body
as
though
to
pull
away
from
something
that
hurt
him
king
was
awake
awakening
he
tried
to
move
his
utter
weakness
like
a
great
weight
bearing
down
upon
him
held
him
powerless
but
his
mind
slowly
freeing
itself
from
the
shadows
of
sleep
was
suddenly
very
clear
he
could
turn
his
head
a
little
it
was
late
afternoon
outside
the
sun
was
still
shining
for
a
patch
of
light
lay
at
the
side
of
the
canvas
flap
at
first
he
did
not
see
gloria
but
his
eyes
quested
until
at
last
they
found
her
she
lay
by
the
fire
her
head
upon
her
arm
sleeping
the
little
huddled
body
looked
weary
beyond
expression
for
a
long
time
his
haggard
eyes
remained
with
her
she
lay
on
the
rocks
without
a
blanket
his
hand
moved
weakly
there
were
blankets
under
him
blankets
covering
him
his
feet
were
wrapped
in
a
blanket
he
remembered
that
a
long
long
time
ago
she
had
said
to
him
it
was
last
night
all
this
long
long
time
he
had
had
all
the
blankets
he
looked
again
at
gloria
at
the
fire
he
saw
wood
piled
near
by
for
many
minutes
he
puzzled
the
matter
in
the
end
it
was
obvious
even
to
a
man
as
sick
as
king
that
she
must
have
gone
for
wood
perhaps
more
than
once
he
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
very
still
he
knew
now
that
he
had
been
desperately
hurt
that
wounded
his
fight
with
brodie
had
brought
him
very
near
a
weakness
from
blood
loss
that
was
pale
twin
to
death
and
yet
he
was
alive
and
warm
he
had
had
broth
and
blankets
and
the
fire
had
been
kept
blazing
he
managed
to
slip
a
hand
inside
his
shirt
before
his
fingers
found
it
he
knew
that
the
bandage
was
there
gloria
had
done
all
this
gloria
whom
he
had
struck
ever
since
that
blow
the
one
act
of
his
life
which
he
would
have
given
so
much
to
have
undone
he
had
been
ashamed
he
had
rejoiced
in
his
battle
with
the
men
who
had
threatened
gloria
with
worse
than
death
rejoiced
that
in
some
way
he
might
make
reparation
but
now
beginning
to
understand
all
that
gloria
had
done
for
him
how
great
were
the
sacrifices
she
had
made
for
him
lying
unconscious
of
all
she
did
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
thing
that
he
had
done
was
a
very
small
thing
set
in
the
scales
against
her
own
acts
he
wanted
to
get
up
and
go
to
her
to
put
his
blankets
about
her
to
play
the
man
part
and
protect
and
shelter
but
he
could
not
so
much
as
raise
his
voice
to
call
her
to
him
ever
since
that
blow
upbraiding
himself
he
had
said
she
was
only
a
little
terrified
girl
and
you
were
a
brute
to
her
and
now
he
thought
wonderingly
after
that
she
has
worked
for
you
has
nursed
you
has
saved
the
worthless
life
in
you
when
she
should
have
let
you
die
again
his
eyes
flew
open
now
they
clung
to
her
with
a
strange
look
in
them
born
of
many
emotions
gloria
as
though
she
felt
his
eyes
upon
her
stirred
rose
pushed
the
hair
back
from
her
eyes
and
came
quickly
to
him
and
as
she
came
she
smiled
she
went
down
on
her
knees
beside
him
and
took
his
hand
in
her
two
and
held
it
tight
she
had
never
seen
in
his
eyes
a
look
like
the
one
now
burning
in
them
she
could
not
understand
its
mute
message
but
she
spoke
softly
everything
is
all
right
mark
and
you
are
better
every
time
you
wake
his
lips
strove
to
frame
words
she
bent
close
to
them
and
heard
his
wondering
whisper
every
thing
all
right
yes
thank
god
she
whispered
back
to
him
everything
in
all
the
wide
wide
world
no
he
could
not
understand
that
she
saw
perplexity
in
his
eyes
now
but
she
did
not
mean
to
let
him
talk
yet
and
it
was
time
for
broth
again
but
again
he
was
whispering
blankets
yours
yes
mark
after
you
have
had
your
nourishment
when
i
need
them
but
when
he
had
taken
his
cup
of
hot
broth
he
slipped
off
to
sleep
again
and
gloria
smiling
a
tender
smile
sat
by
her
fire
watching
him
as
a
mother
watches
a
sick
baby
who
the
doctor
has
just
told
her
will
live
that
night
gloria
listening
now
to
king
breathing
now
to
the
crackling
of
her
fire
grew
restless
restless
again
and
again
she
went
to
look
out
into
the
quiet
moonlight
night
across
the
glittering
expanses
of
pure
white
glistening
snow
it
was
the
restlessness
of
one
who
had
taken
a
giant
determination
who
but
awaited
impatiently
for
the
time
to
do
what
she
was
bent
upon
doing
in
her
heart
was
still
that
gladness
in
her
bosom
there
was
still
something
singing
like
the
liquid
voice
of
a
bird
it
had
sung
for
the
first
time
when
first
she
had
ministered
to
king
when
she
had
understood
what
love
service
was
when
she
had
gone
down
the
cliffs
for
firewood
when
because
of
her
tireless
nursing
she
had
been
rewarded
by
his
opening
eyes
as
the
hours
wore
on
it
had
grown
into
a
chant
triumphant
she
gloria
had
lived
to
do
something
that
was
noble
and
unselfish
and
brave
she
gloria
had
been
unafraid
and
unswerving
she
had
saved
a
man
life
and
that
life
was
mark
king
she
had
made
amends
she
had
set
her
feet
unfalteringly
in
a
new
trail
throughout
her
being
she
was
aglow
with
the
consciousness
of
one
who
had
gladly
done
love
labour
now
she
waited
only
for
the
hour
when
again
king
must
have
his
broth
she
gave
it
to
him
smiled
at
him
commanded
him
to
go
back
to
sleep
promising
to
talk
with
him
in
the
morning
and
then
when
again
he
breathed
with
the
quiet
regularity
of
one
sleeping
she
went
eagerly
about
her
task
now
at
her
hour
of
need
she
was
buoyed
up
by
a
great
and
wonderful
confidence
that
she
could
not
fail
thus
far
she
had
accomplished
each
duty
as
it
had
stood
before
her
and
from
successes
achieved
grew
the
new
faith
that
in
task
perhaps
the
supreme
and
final
labour
she
would
succeed
again
they
must
have
more
meat
or
the
next
day
at
latest
for
the
steaks
which
she
had
eaten
and
the
strong
broths
to
maintain
and
rebuild
strength
in
king
had
cut
deeply
into
their
supply
and
she
knew
mark
king
well
enough
to
be
very
certain
that
the
moment
he
could
summon
strength
enough
to
command
his
tottering
body
to
stand
on
two
legs
he
would
go
now
while
he
was
still
too
weak
to
observe
greatly
what
went
on
about
him
and
while
he
slept
most
of
the
time
it
was
for
her
to
be
before
him
fortunately
and
were
not
all
omens
bright
with
hope
it
had
not
snowed
since
king
made
his
kill
she
could
follow
in
the
trail
he
had
made
and
it
would
lead
her
unerringly
to
the
spot
where
he
had
left
the
rest
of
the
meat
she
had
everything
ready
rifle
small
packet
of
food
knife
even
matches
and
strips
torn
from
the
sack
for
her
feet
down
in
the
gorge
clutching
her
rifle
she
stood
looking
listening
always
the
thought
of
benny
and
the
other
man
was
on
the
rim
of
her
consciousness
and
fear
is
a
basic
and
elemental
emotion
but
though
the
moon
set
forth
all
details
in
clear
relief
against
the
snow
there
was
no
man
in
sight
and
in
the
intense
determination
possessing
her
she
throttled
down
all
she
clung
with
a
deep
fervour
to
the
thoughts
that
she
and
mark
king
had
put
disaster
behind
them
that
ahead
lay
hope
and
happiness
that
god
was
with
her
and
about
her
and
that
all
danger
was
gone
down
the
canon
she
saw
the
broken
uneven
snow
where
brodie
and
his
men
had
left
their
tracks
irregular
trails
up
which
gratton
had
come
down
which
benny
and
the
italian
had
fled
upward
along
the
gorge
was
one
deep
straight
path
wide
and
hard
packed
the
track
of
mark
king
crude
into
this
she
stepped
thinking
even
at
the
time
how
even
mark
trail
was
characteristic
of
him
and
different
from
that
of
the
other
men
it
looked
purposeful
and
confident
and
like
the
man
himself
driving
straight
on
there
was
a
sense
of
comfort
in
treading
where
he
had
trodden
before
her
the
world
slept
but
its
quiet
breathing
she
seemed
to
hear
as
the
air
drew
through
the
pines
she
turned
up
the
gorge
a
tiny
dark
figure
in
an
immense
white
wilderness
the
stars
shone
and
she
loved
them
they
were
like
bright
companionable
candles
the
moon
shed
its
soft
lustre
and
she
loved
it
it
thrust
shadows
back
and
drove
out
the
dark
the
night
was
all
quiet
splendour
and
peace
and
serenity
the
snow
was
crisp
crunching
underfoot
sunny
days
had
thawed
clear
cold
nights
had
frozen
and
the
crust
had
begun
to
form
before
she
had
gone
a
dozen
feet
she
discovered
this
and
its
importance
to
her
where
king
weight
on
the
along
a
trail
had
packed
the
snow
and
where
now
the
sun
and
cold
had
done
their
work
there
was
a
crust
which
upbore
her
slight
weight
she
could
walk
swiftly
there
was
to
be
no
more
floundering
she
could
run
and
run
she
did
when
she
had
crested
the
first
ridge
and
had
started
down
the
far
side
it
was
like
flying
the
crisp
air
cut
her
glowing
cheeks
her
blood
leaped
along
her
veins
she
breathed
deeply
a
great
uplifting
elation
bore
her
along
love
god
is
love
smoothed
the
way
before
her
the
stars
ran
with
her
the
great
blazing
stars
to
which
again
and
again
she
lifted
her
eyes
they
spoke
to
her
they
came
close
to
her
when
she
stopped
resting
they
were
all
about
her
bending
down
and
she
was
lifted
up
among
them
fervour
and
the
ecstasy
of
the
hour
in
which
was
doing
to
the
uttermost
forgetful
of
pettiness
and
selfishness
and
cowardice
she
prayed
mutely
that
she
was
done
with
them
for
ever
that
never
again
would
she
be
such
a
woman
as
gratton
had
been
a
man
made
her
over
into
a
radiant
glorious
gloria
the
night
stamped
itself
upon
her
for
all
time
out
of
the
night
she
drew
as
one
draws
air
into
his
lungs
a
new
faith
that
was
akin
to
the
man
whom
she
served
for
one
can
not
be
alone
with
the
stars
and
be
unmoved
by
them
they
are
serene
with
eternity
refulgent
with
the
perfect
beauty
of
a
perfect
creation
eloquent
to
the
heart
of
man
and
woman
of
true
values
under
the
fields
of
their
vastitude
confronted
by
their
infinity
gloria
like
thousands
before
understood
that
man
in
fevered
times
is
prone
to
turn
to
false
gods
gus
ingle
gold
her
own
gold
one
day
was
a
thing
to
smile
at
or
at
best
not
a
thing
to
expend
wildly
for
gowns
and
gowns
and
shoes
and
stockings
and
limousines
gloria
felt
that
she
had
had
her
fill
of
vanities
like
those
that
she
was
done
with
them
that
if
for
every
moan
and
agony
and
slow
death
and
thought
of
envy
gus
ingle
gold
had
brought
into
the
world
she
could
create
a
smile
here
and
a
hope
fulfilled
there
and
a
glow
yonder
she
would
ask
nothing
else
of
the
yellow
dirt
for
dirt
or
rock
or
dross
it
was
and
that
was
as
clear
as
starlight
if
her
hand
but
lay
in
the
hand
of
mark
king
what
did
gold
matter
or
dresses
or
what
people
thought
or
said
of
her
or
him
a
strange
little
smile
touched
her
lips
i
love
you
she
whispered
as
though
mark
were
with
her
as
in
her
soul
he
was
had
there
not
been
a
great
glowing
love
in
her
heart
she
would
have
been
afraid
but
there
was
no
room
for
fear
had
she
not
felt
that
he
was
with
her
and
that
god
was
with
her
she
must
have
felt
an
unutterable
dreary
loneliness
but
she
was
upborne
at
every
step
and
gloried
in
every
exertion
and
exertion
until
she
came
close
to
the
limits
of
endurance
was
to
be
hers
that
white
night
hers
the
knowledge
of
supreme
endeavour
on
and
on
she
went
across
the
immense
glistening
smooth
fields
through
which
the
trail
ahead
was
the
only
scar
through
groves
of
black
pines
whispering
whispering
whispering
down
into
canons
out
into
the
open
again
up
and
down
and
on
and
on
a
tiny
dot
upon
the
endless
wastes
fatigue
came
upon
her
suddenly
when
she
had
forgotten
to
save
her
strength
and
had
gone
she
rested
lying
on
her
back
her
eyes
closed
she
opened
her
eyes
she
saw
the
stars
she
rose
and
went
on
she
had
gone
miles
how
many
she
could
not
guess
always
after
for
a
little
while
she
had
dropped
down
wearily
she
rose
again
and
went
on
she
learned
that
though
beaten
down
one
might
rise
again
that
was
mark
king
way
it
would
be
her
way
despite
the
rags
about
her
boots
her
feet
were
soon
dangerously
cold
she
passed
into
the
embrace
of
a
forest
of
black
trees
casting
blacker
shadows
their
branches
seemed
motionless
but
they
sang
to
her
with
hushed
voices
and
always
there
was
the
trail
king
had
made
leading
her
on
where
he
had
gone
before
she
followed
where
he
had
made
slow
progress
seeking
game
and
breaking
trail
she
went
swiftly
on
the
packed
snow
so
in
the
full
splendour
of
the
moon
she
came
at
last
to
the
final
ridge
whence
looking
down
into
the
canon
she
saw
the
end
of
her
trail
hanging
from
a
bent
pine
sapling
was
what
she
knew
must
be
his
bear
down
the
steep
slope
she
went
half
sliding
half
rolling
in
the
bed
of
the
ravine
she
landed
softly
in
the
drift
here
she
rested
sitting
in
a
nest
of
snow
and
before
she
had
stirred
to
begin
the
last
short
span
of
her
journey
there
came
suddenly
out
of
the
silence
a
strange
quivering
cry
bursting
out
upon
her
a
sobbing
throbbing
scream
a
woman
cried
gloria
aghast
a
woman
in
an
agony
of
terror
she
thought
or
a
lost
soul
the
wandering
spirit
of
the
dead
or
god
knew
what
impossible
thing
sudden
terror
leaped
out
upon
her
striking
like
a
knife
into
her
heart
fear
banished
all
this
time
surprised
her
and
clutched
at
her
throat
and
paralysed
her
muscles
blind
panic
gripped
her
then
came
the
piercing
scream
again
and
with
it
enlightenment
and
gloria
sank
back
seeming
to
melt
into
the
snow
about
her
yonder
just
upon
the
next
ridge
where
the
moonlight
carved
in
fine
details
the
outline
of
a
big
bare
boulder
stood
the
thing
that
had
screamed
in
this
light
its
great
body
was
weirdly
magnified
so
that
the
entire
length
of
seven
or
eight
feet
appeared
to
gloria
frightened
eyes
twice
that
and
lithe
and
merciless
and
the
big
cat
in
silhouette
twitched
its
restless
tail
back
and
forth
nervously
and
from
snarling
jaws
sent
forth
its
almost
human
call
to
cut
across
vast
still
distances
gloria
drew
back
and
back
where
she
crouched
her
body
pressed
into
the
in
a
panicky
desire
to
hide
the
big
cat
had
smelled
the
meat
she
guessed
swiftly
when
it
leaped
upward
seeking
to
snatch
down
the
swinging
weight
or
clambered
up
the
pine
then
she
must
spring
up
and
run
run
as
she
had
never
run
in
her
life
away
from
this
terrible
murderous
thing
back
to
king
unconscious
of
cold
and
wet
she
cowered
and
waited
scarce
breathing
she
saw
how
the
big
beast
put
up
its
head
and
sniffed
did
it
in
reality
smell
the
meat
or
had
it
sensed
her
presence
for
what
seemed
a
very
long
time
the
animal
stood
as
still
as
the
rock
beneath
it
then
silent
and
swift
it
turned
and
like
a
cat
at
home
leaping
down
from
a
table
dropped
into
the
shadows
at
the
base
of
the
rock
and
was
lost
to
gloria
sight
in
a
little
hollow
she
waited
her
eyes
staring
again
all
of
a
sudden
she
saw
it
moving
with
the
stealthy
caution
which
is
its
birthright
it
appeared
fleetingly
a
score
of
feet
lower
on
the
steep
slope
the
body
and
its
shadow
a
twin
for
stealthy
silence
gone
in
a
flash
reappearing
once
more
still
lower
on
the
slope
and
just
beyond
the
pine
sapling
it
was
coming
on
fascinated
gloria
sat
like
stone
with
never
a
thought
of
the
rifle
lying
across
her
knees
the
leaped
downward
softly
from
stage
to
stage
of
the
paused
under
the
pine
lifted
its
head
and
sent
forth
again
its
all
this
time
gloria
sat
breathless
the
still
held
her
powerless
she
watched
the
animal
crouch
and
gather
its
strength
and
hurl
its
lean
body
upward
the
lion
fell
back
the
ripping
claws
having
missed
the
meat
by
some
two
or
three
feet
and
gloria
heard
the
low
rumbling
growl
again
it
sprang
again
it
missed
and
then
for
a
weary
time
of
silence
it
sat
still
its
head
back
its
eyes
on
the
desired
meal
in
the
moonlight
gloria
saw
the
glistening
saliva
from
the
jaws
but
in
the
end
feline
craft
found
the
way
and
the
cat
set
its
paws
against
the
tree
trunk
and
began
to
climb
limbs
broke
under
the
two
hundred
pounds
of
weight
the
bark
was
torn
under
slipping
paws
but
upward
the
sinuous
body
writhed
swiftly
now
it
would
come
to
kill
king
gloria
started
this
was
mark
kill
he
had
stalked
it
he
had
ploughed
many
miles
through
deep
snow
to
get
it
to
get
it
for
her
as
well
as
for
him
to
keep
the
life
in
her
now
without
it
king
would
die
and
now
the
lion
was
going
to
take
it
while
she
watched
and
did
nothing
oh
god
help
me
she
sprang
to
her
feet
she
jerked
up
her
rifle
and
fired
at
the
black
bulk
crawling
upward
in
the
pine
it
shall
not
have
mark
meat
it
shall
not
at
the
first
shot
the
dropped
through
crashing
branches
she
had
shot
it
she
had
driven
a
bullet
through
its
heart
god
had
heard
her
that
was
her
first
wild
thought
but
in
a
flash
she
saw
that
it
was
on
its
feet
again
and
that
with
red
mouth
snarling
it
had
swung
about
facing
her
she
saw
the
cruel
white
teeth
wet
and
glistening
incoherently
gloria
cried
out
again
sick
and
shaken
with
terror
in
another
moment
she
would
have
the
lean
powerful
body
leaping
upon
her
she
fired
again
and
again
taking
no
time
for
aim
as
fast
as
she
could
work
the
lever
and
pull
the
trigger
she
was
trembling
so
that
it
was
all
that
she
could
do
to
hold
the
gun
at
all
she
prayed
and
called
on
mark
and
fired
all
at
once
never
did
bullets
fly
wider
of
the
mark
but
never
did
the
roar
of
exploding
shells
do
better
service
the
lion
though
ravenous
was
not
yet
starved
to
the
degree
to
whip
it
to
the
supreme
desperation
of
attacking
a
human
being
and
defying
a
rifle
it
whirled
and
went
flashing
across
the
snow
seeking
the
shadows
gone
in
the
drifts
vanishing
gloria
gasped
stared
after
its
wild
flight
a
paralysed
moment
and
then
ran
to
the
tree
where
the
bear
hung
she
was
shaking
like
a
leaf
in
a
storm
she
was
still
terrified
filled
with
horror
at
the
thought
that
at
any
second
the
lean
body
might
come
flashing
back
upon
her
but
through
the
emotions
storming
through
her
there
lived
on
that
one
determination
that
would
live
while
she
lived
that
was
mark
meat
and
she
was
going
to
save
it
for
him
she
began
climbing
the
young
pine
she
fought
wildly
to
get
up
into
its
branches
she
was
handicapped
by
the
rifle
which
she
clung
to
desperately
she
got
the
gun
in
a
crotch
above
her
head
she
pulled
herself
upward
she
slipped
and
tore
the
skin
of
hands
and
arms
but
hastening
frantically
she
climbed
up
and
up
she
got
the
rifle
into
her
hands
again
nearly
dropped
it
thrust
it
above
her
jammed
it
into
a
fork
of
a
limb
and
kept
on
climbing
at
last
she
was
where
she
could
reach
out
and
touch
the
swinging
carcass
with
butcher
knife
she
hacked
and
cut
at
the
frozen
meat
panting
with
every
effort
the
task
seemed
endless
the
bear
swung
away
from
her
a
branch
broke
under
her
foot
and
she
almost
fell
she
was
sobbing
aloud
brokenly
before
it
was
done
the
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
but
at
last
there
was
the
thud
of
the
falling
meat
below
her
it
lay
on
the
snow
crust
in
wild
haste
she
snatched
her
rifle
holding
it
in
one
hand
afraid
to
let
it
slip
out
of
her
grasp
for
a
moment
casting
a
last
fearful
look
in
the
direction
whither
the
lion
had
gone
she
began
slipping
down
and
in
another
moment
with
the
precious
burden
caught
up
with
the
gun
in
her
arms
she
was
running
back
up
the
ridge
her
feet
in
king
trail
home
she
looked
behind
her
at
every
step
picturing
the
snarling
cat
springing
out
from
every
shadow
starting
upward
from
every
drift
and
but
she
clutched
her
meat
tight
and
struggled
on
up
the
slope
her
whole
body
was
shaking
she
closed
her
eyes
overcome
with
faintness
there
was
a
faint
wind
stirring
and
it
cut
like
a
knife
probing
through
her
garments
where
they
were
damp
she
shivered
and
struggled
on
and
on
she
felt
that
she
could
run
all
night
without
stopping
she
stumbled
and
fell
and
arose
panting
and
sobbing
and
ran
on
she
no
longer
looked
behind
her
she
had
fallen
when
she
did
that
again
and
again
from
far
behind
her
came
the
clear
merciless
scream
of
the
time
passed
or
hour
or
two
hours
she
had
little
idea
time
itself
was
a
nightmare
of
running
falling
rising
staggering
running
again
until
the
blood
pounded
in
her
temples
drummed
in
her
ears
the
cry
came
again
as
near
as
before
nearer
throughout
the
night
as
she
struggled
on
she
could
always
fancy
the
stealthy
silent
feet
following
her
keeping
time
with
her
own
cautious
now
would
its
caution
slowly
subside
as
its
hunger
grew
and
as
she
always
fled
from
it
the
thought
came
to
her
that
such
a
menace
would
follow
one
day
after
day
that
it
would
wait
and
wait
that
in
the
end
it
knew
its
time
would
come
when
sleep
or
exhaustion
broke
down
its
prey
guard
then
it
would
leap
and
strike
her
rifle
had
grown
a
weight
until
it
seemed
that
it
would
drag
her
arms
from
their
sockets
to
hold
it
up
the
pack
of
meat
on
her
back
was
like
lead
she
wondered
if
king
had
missed
her
if
he
were
awake
and
wondering
at
her
absence
she
wondered
if
he
would
miss
her
soon
how
soon
at
the
first
glint
of
dawn
would
he
begin
to
see
that
she
was
at
least
and
at
last
trying
well
she
had
tried
though
she
died
still
she
had
tried
she
was
cold
to
the
bone
her
teeth
chattered
her
body
quaked
yet
she
kept
on
she
fell
she
lay
with
the
tears
of
exhaustion
rolling
down
her
face
she
struggled
to
get
to
her
feet
she
fell
again
but
always
she
rose
and
always
she
kept
on
and
so
in
the
fulness
of
time
after
long
frightful
hellish
hours
came
to
the
last
terror
of
the
night
the
new
day
was
bright
on
the
mountain
tops
when
she
felt
at
first
a
dull
sort
of
surprise
and
then
a
sudden
stimulating
gladness
noting
the
familiar
look
of
the
ridge
ahead
yonder
the
cave
would
be
the
cave
and
king
success
and
rest
she
straightened
up
a
little
brushing
her
hand
across
her
straining
eyes
making
sure
that
she
was
right
she
heard
the
insistent
scream
behind
her
but
now
she
did
not
heed
it
for
in
front
of
her
in
the
trail
was
a
man
it
was
benny
she
had
thrilled
to
an
ecstasy
descending
from
the
stars
welling
up
in
her
own
heart
and
she
had
shivered
with
fear
and
had
dropped
with
weariness
akin
to
despair
now
suddenly
all
emotions
were
upgathered
into
searing
anger
her
thought
was
he
will
take
the
meat
from
me
the
meat
i
have
brought
for
mark
she
grew
rigid
in
her
tracks
she
jerked
up
her
rifle
in
front
of
her
her
tired
eyes
hardened
she
had
gone
to
the
limits
of
endurance
in
a
labour
of
love
she
had
succeeded
and
now
she
would
fight
for
what
she
had
brought
back
then
she
noted
that
benny
had
not
seen
her
though
he
was
in
full
view
on
the
ridge
he
had
had
no
eyes
for
her
he
was
stooping
she
saw
that
he
had
a
small
pack
on
his
back
food
no
doubt
on
the
ground
by
him
was
a
second
pack
something
in
a
crash
sack
benny
was
struggling
to
lift
it
to
his
shoulders
it
must
be
very
heavy
gloria
drew
back
hastily
glancing
about
her
found
the
only
offered
and
slipped
behind
the
big
rock
presently
benny
came
on
she
heard
him
from
a
distance
he
was
talking
to
himself
excitedly
jabbering
broken
fragments
of
sentences
twice
breaking
into
his
hideous
dry
cackle
of
laughter
she
shivered
his
utterances
sounded
mad
and
mad
they
were
perhaps
his
drug
had
run
out
certainly
for
a
nervous
man
there
had
been
ample
cause
for
jangling
nerves
he
jabbered
constantly
his
mutterings
at
last
coming
to
her
in
jumbled
words
as
benny
drew
on
he
was
talking
about
gold
and
he
chuckled
he
mentioned
names
brodie
and
jarrold
and
gratton
and
another
name
and
he
chuckled
again
gloria
peered
cautiously
from
the
shelter
of
her
rock
he
was
very
near
now
struggling
with
the
smaller
pack
and
his
rifle
and
the
heavy
bundle
in
his
sack
she
thought
that
he
was
going
to
pass
without
seeing
her
but
just
as
he
passed
abreast
of
her
something
prompted
benny
to
jerk
up
his
head
he
saw
her
and
stopped
suddenly
she
saw
his
eyes
and
she
knew
on
the
instant
that
if
the
man
were
not
stark
mad
at
least
he
was
not
entirely
sane
she
lifted
her
rifle
cold
all
over
if
he
came
another
step
nearer
she
would
shoot
it
mine
benny
shrieked
at
her
mine
i
tell
you
he
broke
into
a
run
passing
her
leaving
the
trail
floundering
down
the
ridge
the
shortest
way
his
rifle
encumbered
him
she
saw
it
fall
into
the
snow
while
benny
clutching
his
in
both
arms
stumbled
on
he
fell
he
rose
shrieking
curses
she
watched
fascinated
the
pack
on
his
back
slipped
around
in
front
of
him
benny
tore
at
it
and
cursed
it
and
hurled
it
from
him
still
hugging
his
gold
he
was
gone
far
down
the
steep
slope
gloria
shuddered
and
stepped
back
into
her
own
trail
she
could
hear
benny
cursing
faintly
like
an
echo
came
another
cry
across
the
ridges
the
cry
of
a
starving
cat
mark
king
awakened
to
a
sensation
of
piercing
cold
in
his
weakened
condition
the
chill
struck
deep
the
pain
of
it
sore
in
his
wound
he
moved
a
little
to
draw
his
blankets
closer
about
him
and
as
an
awaking
impression
found
that
his
strength
even
though
slowly
was
surely
returning
to
him
he
was
still
terribly
weak
but
thank
god
and
gloria
that
hideous
faintness
in
which
he
had
been
unable
to
stir
hand
or
foot
or
to
speak
above
a
whisper
had
passed
he
filled
his
lungs
with
a
deep
and
grateful
breath
of
satisfaction
in
a
day
or
two
he
would
be
able
to
carry
on
again
to
do
his
part
he
turned
his
head
lifting
it
a
trifle
already
he
had
thought
of
gloria
and
now
he
sought
her
the
fire
had
burned
down
to
a
handful
of
glowing
coals
gloria
then
must
be
asleep
for
that
too
he
was
grateful
he
had
but
faint
remembrance
and
dim
knowledge
of
what
tasks
must
have
fallen
to
her
lot
but
his
mind
active
from
the
moment
his
eyes
flew
open
was
quick
to
understand
that
the
burdens
had
fallen
upon
her
shoulders
and
that
she
must
have
been
in
dire
need
of
rest
and
sleep
he
could
not
see
her
anywhere
no
doubt
she
lay
in
the
shadowy
dark
beyond
the
dying
fire
he
lay
back
staring
up
into
the
gloom
above
him
it
was
thinning
day
was
coming
or
had
come
already
a
day
with
sunshine
they
could
go
out
on
the
crust
by
the
time
that
he
was
able
to
be
about
then
he
remembered
the
blankets
last
night
he
had
had
all
of
them
gloria
as
well
as
his
own
he
had
wanted
to
make
her
take
her
covers
and
she
had
put
him
off
and
he
had
gone
to
sleep
forgetting
he
stirred
again
hastily
his
hands
groping
even
his
feet
moving
he
had
them
yet
his
and
hers
and
she
had
slept
through
the
cold
night
with
no
covering
while
he
never
waking
until
now
had
lain
warm
and
comfortable
he
struggled
to
turn
on
his
side
and
got
himself
raised
a
little
despite
the
pain
from
the
exertion
seeking
her
she
must
be
frozen
gloria
was
not
in
the
cave
he
sank
back
sure
of
that
for
she
should
be
sleeping
close
by
the
fire
then
she
had
gone
down
again
for
wood
he
frowned
and
lay
staring
upward
again
gloria
bringing
wood
while
he
lay
here
like
a
confounded
log
he
grew
nervously
restive
at
the
thought
it
was
unthinkable
that
she
should
do
work
like
that
he
saw
her
in
his
mind
struggling
with
the
unaccustomed
labour
and
always
he
saw
her
as
he
had
first
seen
her
a
girl
a
girl
with
sweet
little
hands
as
soft
as
rose
petals
he
remembered
her
as
he
had
seen
her
that
first
day
a
vision
of
loveliness
in
her
fluffy
pink
dress
her
skin
like
the
skin
of
a
baby
her
eyes
the
soft
tender
grey
eyes
of
the
girl
to
whom
he
had
given
his
heart
without
reservation
the
glorious
gloria
all
slender
delicacy
like
a
little
mountain
flower
the
gloria
for
whom
it
had
been
his
duty
and
his
high
privilege
to
labour
he
must
fight
to
get
his
strength
back
to
get
on
his
feet
again
to
save
her
from
such
toil
as
was
no
woman
work
in
the
world
certainly
never
the
work
for
a
girl
like
gloria
he
heard
a
sound
at
the
cave
mouth
gloria
was
coming
back
he
found
no
words
with
which
to
greet
her
but
lay
very
still
waiting
for
her
to
come
in
an
emotion
of
which
he
was
ashamed
and
yet
which
was
infinitely
sweet
swept
over
him
it
was
so
wonderful
a
thing
to
have
gloria
come
to
him
nurse
him
put
her
hand
so
tenderly
on
his
a
thrill
shot
down
his
faintly
stirring
pulses
as
already
he
fancied
her
stealing
softly
to
his
side
so
he
waited
and
when
she
came
where
he
could
at
last
see
her
watched
she
set
her
gun
down
at
first
he
wondered
at
that
poor
little
gloria
he
thought
taking
her
rifle
with
her
when
she
went
down
for
wood
frightened
and
yet
enough
to
go
in
spite
of
fear
she
came
on
not
to
him
but
to
the
smouldering
coals
she
had
turned
toward
him
but
no
doubt
thought
him
still
asleep
he
watched
her
still
knowing
that
presently
she
would
come
awaiting
her
coming
and
again
he
was
perplexed
he
did
not
understand
why
gloria
walked
like
that
he
had
never
seen
her
walk
so
before
she
had
always
been
so
light
of
foot
so
graceful
so
like
a
fairy
creature
scarcely
touching
the
ground
now
her
feet
dragged
she
groped
uncertainly
she
was
like
one
gone
suddenly
dizzy
she
dropped
down
by
the
coals
her
face
in
her
hands
the
light
was
bad
he
could
hardly
see
her
now
he
heard
a
sigh
that
ended
in
a
sob
she
rose
oh
so
wearily
he
saw
her
sway
as
she
walked
she
was
throwing
wood
on
the
fire
it
caught
a
flame
flared
out
other
flames
followed
with
their
merry
crackling
and
leaping
lights
and
now
he
saw
face
it
was
drawn
and
haggard
it
had
been
washed
with
tears
her
eyes
looked
enormous
and
unnaturally
bright
he
saw
her
hair
it
was
in
wild
disarray
a
tumble
of
disorder
he
saw
that
she
had
sacks
wrapped
about
her
lagging
feet
that
her
clothes
were
torn
that
her
sleeves
were
ragged
that
her
arms
were
covered
with
long
scratches
his
first
thought
making
his
body
tense
with
anger
was
that
he
had
not
come
in
time
to
save
her
from
brodie
hands
what
was
gloria
doing
struggling
with
something
on
her
back
something
which
was
tied
across
her
shoulders
she
got
it
free
it
fell
close
to
the
fire
played
over
by
the
light
of
the
flames
he
craned
his
neck
and
saw
it
was
a
great
chunk
of
bear
meat
he
could
see
bits
of
the
hide
still
on
it
he
could
not
understand
not
yet
all
that
he
could
do
was
stare
at
her
and
wonder
and
grope
confusedly
for
the
explanation
it
was
clear
that
something
was
wrong
with
gloria
she
dropped
down
by
the
fire
she
slumped
forward
she
lay
her
face
upon
her
crossed
arms
he
could
see
the
frail
body
shaking
he
could
hear
her
sudden
wild
sobbing
the
truth
came
upon
him
at
last
dawning
slowly
slowly
gloria
it
was
a
gasp
of
more
than
amazement
consternation
was
in
his
heart
she
lifted
her
head
and
sat
up
he
saw
her
great
eyes
and
the
tears
gushing
from
them
she
fought
to
control
herself
a
sob
in
her
throat
she
rose
and
came
toward
him
in
strange
wildly
uncertain
steps
gloria
you
sh
mark
you
must
but
he
could
lie
still
he
lifted
himself
upon
his
elbow
and
looked
at
her
with
wondering
eyes
she
stood
over
him
looking
on
the
verge
of
collapse
slowly
she
came
down
to
him
half
kneeling
half
falling
my
god
he
cried
hoarsely
you
went
for
my
bear
did
she
tried
to
smile
at
him
and
into
his
own
eyes
there
broke
a
sudden
gush
of
tears
you
wonderful
wonderful
wonderful
gloria
he
cried
out
there
is
no
girl
in
all
the
world
could
have
done
that
there
is
no
girl
like
you
her
hand
was
questing
his
he
caught
it
and
gripped
it
with
all
the
strength
in
him
he
hurt
her
and
at
last
with
the
pain
her
smile
broke
through
gloria
mark
can
you
not
so
soon
but
some
day
forgive
me
she
found
only
a
faint
whisper
with
which
to
answer
him
her
eyes
were
as
hungry
as
his
can
you
forgive
mark
and
now
when
their
eyes
clung
together
as
their
hands
were
already
clinging
each
was
marvelling
that
the
other
could
forgive
and
love
one
who
had
erred
so
the
end
