the
stories
of
the
three
burglars
by
frank
stockton
the
stories
of
the
three
burglars
i
am
a
householder
in
a
pleasant
country
neighbourhood
about
twenty
miles
from
new
york
my
family
consists
of
myself
and
wife
our
boy
george
william
aged
two
two
and
a
man
but
in
the
summer
we
have
frequent
visitors
and
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
about
to
write
my
aunt
martha
was
staying
with
us
my
house
is
large
and
pleasant
and
we
have
neighbours
near
enough
for
social
purposes
and
yet
not
too
near
or
too
many
to
detract
from
the
rural
aspect
of
our
surroundings
but
we
do
not
live
in
a
paradise
we
are
occasionally
troubled
by
mosquitoes
and
burglars
against
the
first
of
these
annoyances
we
have
always
been
able
to
guard
ourselves
at
least
in
a
measure
and
our
man
and
the
cook
declare
that
they
have
become
so
used
to
them
that
they
do
not
mind
them
but
to
guard
against
burglars
is
much
more
difficult
and
to
become
used
to
them
would
i
think
require
a
great
deal
of
practice
for
several
months
before
the
period
of
this
narrative
our
neighbourhood
had
been
subject
to
visits
from
burglars
from
time
to
time
houses
had
been
entered
and
robbed
and
the
offenders
had
never
been
detected
we
had
no
police
force
not
even
a
village
organization
there
was
a
small
railway
station
near
our
house
and
six
miles
away
was
the
county
town
for
fire
and
police
protection
each
household
was
obliged
to
depend
upon
itself
before
the
beginning
of
the
burglarious
enterprises
in
our
midst
we
had
not
felt
the
need
of
much
protection
in
this
direction
sometimes
poultry
was
stolen
but
this
was
a
rare
occurrence
and
although
windows
and
doors
were
generally
fastened
for
the
night
this
labour
was
often
considered
much
more
troublesome
than
necessary
but
now
a
great
change
had
taken
place
in
the
feelings
of
our
community
when
the
first
robbery
occurred
the
neighbours
were
inclined
to
laugh
about
it
and
to
say
that
captain
hubbard
habit
of
sitting
up
after
the
rest
of
his
family
had
gone
to
bed
and
then
retiring
and
forgetting
to
close
the
front
door
had
invited
the
entrance
of
a
passing
tramp
but
when
a
second
and
a
third
house
where
windows
and
doors
had
not
been
left
open
had
been
entered
and
in
a
measure
despoiled
people
ceased
to
laugh
and
if
there
had
been
any
merriment
at
all
on
the
subject
it
would
have
been
caused
by
the
extraordinary
and
remarkable
precautions
taken
against
the
entrance
of
thieves
by
night
the
loaded
pistol
became
the
favourite
companion
of
the
head
of
the
house
those
who
had
no
bought
them
there
were
new
locks
new
bolts
new
fastenings
at
one
time
there
was
a
mounted
patrol
of
young
men
which
however
was
soon
broken
up
by
their
mothers
but
this
trouble
was
unavailing
for
at
intervals
the
burglaries
continued
as
a
matter
of
course
a
great
many
theories
were
broached
as
to
the
reasons
for
this
disturbance
in
our
hitherto
peaceful
neighbourhood
we
were
at
such
a
distance
from
the
ordinary
centres
of
crime
that
it
was
generally
considered
that
professional
burglars
would
hardly
take
the
trouble
to
get
to
us
or
to
get
away
from
us
and
that
therefore
the
offences
were
probably
committed
by
unsuspected
persons
living
in
this
part
of
the
country
who
had
easy
means
of
determining
which
houses
were
worth
breaking
into
and
what
method
of
entrance
would
be
most
feasible
in
this
way
some
families
hitherto
regarded
as
respectable
families
had
fallen
under
suspicion
so
far
mine
was
the
only
house
of
any
importance
within
the
distance
of
a
mile
from
the
station
which
had
not
in
some
way
suffered
from
burglars
in
one
or
two
of
these
cases
the
offenders
had
been
frightened
away
before
they
had
done
any
other
injury
than
the
breaking
of
a
but
we
had
been
spared
any
visitation
whatever
after
a
time
we
began
to
consider
that
this
was
an
invidious
distinction
of
course
we
did
not
desire
that
robbers
should
break
into
our
house
and
steal
but
it
was
a
sort
of
implied
insult
that
robbers
should
think
that
our
house
was
not
worth
breaking
into
we
contrived
however
to
bear
up
under
this
implied
contempt
and
even
under
the
facetious
imputations
of
some
of
our
lively
neighbours
who
declared
that
it
looked
very
suspicious
that
we
should
lose
nothing
and
even
continue
to
add
to
our
worldly
goods
while
everybody
else
was
suffering
from
abstractions
i
did
not
however
allow
any
relaxation
in
my
vigilance
in
the
protection
of
my
house
and
family
my
time
to
suffer
had
not
yet
arrived
and
it
might
not
arrive
at
all
but
if
it
did
come
it
should
not
be
my
fault
i
therefore
carefully
examined
all
the
new
precautions
my
neighbours
had
taken
against
the
entrance
of
thieves
and
where
i
approved
of
them
i
adopted
them
of
some
of
these
my
wife
and
i
did
not
approve
for
instance
a
tin
pan
containing
iron
spoons
the
dinner
bell
and
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
hardware
balanced
on
the
top
stair
of
the
staircase
and
so
connected
with
fine
cords
that
a
thief
coming
up
the
stairs
would
send
it
rattling
and
bounding
to
the
bottom
was
looked
upon
by
us
with
great
disfavour
the
descent
of
the
pan
whether
by
innocent
accident
or
the
approach
of
a
burglar
might
throw
our
little
boy
into
a
fit
to
say
nothing
of
the
terrible
fright
it
would
give
my
aunt
martha
who
was
a
maiden
lady
of
middle
age
and
not
accustomed
to
a
clatter
in
the
night
a
in
the
house
my
wife
would
not
have
nor
indeed
a
dog
of
any
kind
george
william
was
not
yet
old
enough
to
play
with
dogs
especially
a
sharp
one
and
if
the
dog
was
not
sharp
it
was
of
no
use
to
have
him
in
the
house
to
the
ordinary
she
strongly
objected
she
had
been
in
houses
where
these
things
went
off
of
their
own
accord
occasioning
great
consternation
and
besides
she
said
that
if
thieves
got
into
the
house
she
did
not
want
to
know
it
and
she
did
not
want
me
to
know
it
the
quicker
they
found
what
they
came
for
and
went
away
with
it
the
better
of
course
she
wished
them
kept
out
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
but
if
they
did
get
in
our
duty
as
parents
of
the
dearest
little
boy
was
she
insisted
however
that
the
room
in
which
the
loveliest
of
children
slept
and
which
was
also
occupied
by
ourselves
should
be
made
absolutely
burglar
proof
and
this
object
by
means
of
extraordinary
bolts
and
chains
i
flattered
myself
i
accomplished
my
aunt
martha
had
a
patent
contrivance
for
fastening
a
door
that
she
always
used
whether
at
home
or
travelling
and
in
whose
merit
she
placed
implicit
confidence
therefore
we
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
be
anxious
about
her
and
the
servants
slept
at
the
top
of
the
house
where
thieves
would
not
be
likely
to
go
they
may
continue
to
slight
us
by
their
absence
said
my
wife
but
i
do
not
believe
that
they
will
be
able
to
frighten
us
by
their
presence
i
was
not
however
so
easily
contented
as
my
wife
of
course
i
wished
to
do
everything
possible
to
protect
george
william
and
the
rest
of
the
family
but
i
was
also
very
anxious
to
protect
our
property
in
all
parts
of
the
house
therefore
in
addition
to
everything
else
i
had
done
i
devised
a
scheme
for
interfering
with
the
plans
of
men
who
should
feloniously
break
into
our
home
after
a
consultation
with
a
friend
who
was
a
physician
greatly
interested
in
the
study
of
narcotic
drugs
i
procured
a
mixture
which
was
almost
tasteless
and
without
peculiar
odour
and
of
which
a
small
quantity
would
in
less
than
a
minute
throw
an
ordinary
man
into
a
state
of
unconsciousness
the
potion
was
however
no
more
dangerous
in
its
effects
than
that
quantity
of
ardent
spirits
which
would
cause
entire
insensibility
after
the
lapse
of
several
hours
the
person
under
the
influence
of
the
drug
would
recover
consciousness
without
assistance
but
in
order
to
provide
against
all
contingencies
my
friend
prepared
a
powerful
antidote
which
would
almost
immediately
revive
one
who
had
been
made
unconscious
by
our
potion
the
scheme
that
i
had
devised
may
possibly
have
been
put
into
use
by
others
but
of
this
i
know
not
i
thought
it
a
good
scheme
and
determined
to
experiment
with
it
and
if
possible
to
make
a
trap
which
should
catch
a
burglar
i
would
reveal
this
plan
to
no
one
but
my
friend
the
physician
and
my
wife
secrecy
would
be
an
important
element
in
its
success
our
library
was
a
large
and
pleasant
room
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
house
and
here
i
set
my
trap
it
was
my
habit
to
remain
in
this
room
an
hour
or
so
after
the
rest
of
the
family
had
gone
to
bed
and
as
i
was
an
early
riser
i
was
always
in
it
again
before
it
was
necessary
for
a
servant
to
enter
it
in
the
morning
before
leaving
the
library
for
the
night
i
placed
in
a
conspicuous
position
in
the
room
a
small
table
on
which
was
a
tray
holding
two
decanters
partially
filled
with
wine
in
the
one
red
and
in
the
other
white
there
was
also
upon
the
tray
an
open
box
of
biscuit
and
three
two
of
them
with
a
little
wine
at
the
bottom
i
took
pains
to
make
it
appear
that
these
refreshments
had
been
recently
partaken
of
there
were
biscuit
crumbs
upon
the
tray
and
a
drop
or
two
of
wine
was
freshly
spilled
upon
it
every
time
the
trap
was
set
the
table
thus
arranged
was
left
in
the
room
during
the
night
and
early
in
the
morning
i
put
the
tray
and
its
contents
into
a
closet
and
locked
it
up
a
portion
of
my
narcotic
preparation
was
thoroughly
mixed
with
the
contents
of
each
of
the
decanters
in
such
proportions
that
a
glass
of
the
wine
would
be
sufficient
to
produce
the
desired
effect
it
was
my
opinion
that
there
were
few
men
who
after
a
night
walk
and
perhaps
some
labour
in
forcibly
opening
a
door
or
a
would
not
cease
for
a
moment
in
pursuance
of
their
task
to
partake
of
the
refreshments
so
conveniently
left
behind
them
by
the
occupants
of
the
house
when
they
retired
to
rest
should
my
surmises
be
correct
i
might
reasonably
expect
should
my
house
be
broken
into
to
find
an
unconscious
burglar
in
the
library
when
i
went
down
in
the
morning
and
i
was
sure
and
my
wife
agreed
with
me
that
if
i
should
find
a
burglar
in
that
room
or
any
other
part
of
the
house
it
was
highly
desirable
that
he
should
be
an
unconscious
one
night
after
night
i
set
my
burglar
trap
and
morning
after
morning
i
locked
it
up
in
the
closet
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
exactly
disappointed
that
no
opportunity
offered
to
test
the
value
of
my
plan
but
it
did
seem
a
pity
that
i
should
take
so
much
trouble
for
nothing
it
had
been
some
weeks
since
any
burglaries
had
been
committed
in
the
neighbourhood
and
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
the
miscreants
had
considered
this
field
worked
out
and
had
transferred
their
labours
to
a
place
the
insult
of
having
been
considered
unworthy
the
attention
of
the
knights
of
the
midnight
jimmy
remained
with
us
but
as
all
our
goods
and
chattels
also
remained
with
us
we
could
afford
to
brook
the
indignity
as
the
trap
cost
nothing
my
wife
did
not
object
to
my
setting
it
every
night
for
the
present
something
might
happen
she
remarked
and
it
was
just
as
well
to
be
prepared
in
more
ways
than
one
but
there
was
a
point
upon
which
she
was
very
positive
when
george
william
is
old
enough
to
go
about
the
house
by
himself
she
said
those
decanters
must
not
be
left
exposed
upon
the
table
of
course
i
do
not
expect
him
to
go
about
the
house
drinking
wine
and
everything
that
he
finds
but
there
is
no
knowing
what
a
child
in
the
first
moments
of
his
investigative
existence
may
do
for
myself
i
became
somewhat
tired
of
acting
my
part
in
this
little
farce
every
night
and
morning
but
when
i
have
undertaken
anything
of
this
sort
i
am
slow
to
drop
it
it
was
about
three
weeks
since
i
had
begun
to
set
my
trap
when
i
was
awakened
in
the
night
by
a
sudden
noise
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
as
i
did
so
my
wife
said
to
me
sleepily
what
is
that
was
it
thunder
there
it
is
again
she
exclaimed
starting
up
what
a
crash
it
must
have
struck
somewhere
i
did
not
answer
it
was
not
thunder
it
was
something
in
the
house
and
it
flashed
into
my
mind
that
perhaps
my
trap
had
been
sprung
i
got
out
of
bed
and
began
rapidly
to
dress
what
are
you
going
to
do
anxiously
asked
my
wife
i
going
to
see
what
has
happened
said
i
at
that
moment
there
was
another
noise
this
was
like
two
or
three
heavy
footsteps
followed
by
a
sudden
thump
but
it
was
not
so
loud
as
the
others
john
cried
my
wife
do
stir
an
inch
it
burglars
and
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
seized
me
by
the
arm
i
must
go
down
i
said
but
there
is
really
no
reason
for
your
being
frightened
i
shall
call
david
and
shall
carry
my
pistol
so
there
is
really
no
danger
if
there
are
thieves
in
the
house
they
have
probably
decamped
by
this
time
that
is
if
they
are
able
to
do
so
for
of
course
they
must
know
that
noise
would
awaken
the
soundest
sleepers
my
wife
looked
at
me
and
then
slowly
withdrew
her
hands
from
my
arm
you
promise
me
she
said
if
you
find
a
burglar
downstairs
in
the
possession
of
his
senses
you
will
immediately
come
back
to
me
and
george
william
i
promised
her
and
slipping
on
some
clothes
i
went
out
into
the
hall
i
carried
no
light
before
i
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
back
stairs
i
heard
david
my
man
coming
down
to
be
sure
it
was
he
and
not
a
burglar
i
spoke
to
him
in
a
low
voice
my
pistol
raised
in
case
of
an
unsatisfactory
reply
i
heard
that
noise
sir
he
whispered
and
was
going
down
to
see
about
it
are
you
ready
if
it
thieves
i
whispered
i
have
got
the
he
replied
come
on
then
said
i
and
we
went
downstairs
i
had
left
no
light
in
the
library
but
there
was
one
there
now
and
it
shone
through
the
open
door
into
the
hallway
we
stopped
and
listened
there
was
no
sound
and
then
slowly
and
cautiously
we
approached
the
door
of
the
library
the
scene
i
beheld
astounded
me
and
involuntarily
i
sprang
back
a
step
or
two
so
did
david
but
in
an
instant
we
saw
that
there
was
no
need
of
retreat
or
defence
stretched
upon
the
floor
not
far
from
the
doorway
lay
a
tall
man
his
face
upturned
to
the
light
of
a
lantern
which
stood
by
the
his
eyes
were
shut
and
it
was
evident
that
he
was
perfectly
insensible
near
by
in
the
wreck
of
the
small
table
glasses
and
decanters
lay
another
man
apparently
of
heavier
build
he
also
was
as
still
as
a
corpse
a
little
further
back
half
sitting
on
the
floor
with
the
upper
part
of
his
body
resting
against
the
lounge
was
another
man
with
a
black
mask
over
his
face
are
they
dead
exclaimed
david
in
an
undertone
of
horror
no
said
i
they
are
not
dead
they
have
been
caught
in
my
trap
and
i
must
admit
that
the
consciousness
of
this
created
a
proud
exultation
of
spirit
within
me
i
had
overmatched
these
rascals
they
were
prostrated
before
me
if
one
of
them
moved
david
and
i
could
kill
him
but
i
did
not
believe
there
would
be
any
killing
nor
any
moving
for
the
present
in
a
high
whisper
which
could
have
been
heard
distinctly
all
over
the
house
my
wife
now
called
to
me
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
what
is
it
she
said
what
has
happened
i
stepped
quickly
to
the
stairway
everything
is
all
right
i
said
in
a
loud
distinct
voice
intended
to
assure
my
wife
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
caution
or
alarm
i
will
be
with
you
presently
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
nothing
is
the
matter
said
aunt
martha
now
for
the
first
time
opening
her
door
i
was
afraid
something
had
happened
but
i
had
business
to
attend
to
before
i
could
go
upstairs
in
thinking
over
and
arranging
this
plan
for
the
capture
of
burglars
i
had
carefully
considered
its
various
processes
and
had
provided
against
all
the
contingencies
i
could
think
of
therefore
i
was
not
now
obliged
to
deliberate
what
i
should
do
keep
your
eye
on
them
said
i
to
david
and
if
one
of
them
moves
be
ready
for
him
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
tie
them
hand
and
foot
i
quickly
lighted
a
lamp
and
then
took
from
another
shelf
of
the
closet
a
large
coil
of
strong
cotton
rope
which
i
had
provided
for
such
an
occasion
as
the
present
now
said
i
to
david
i
will
tie
them
while
you
stand
by
to
knock
over
any
one
of
them
who
attempts
to
get
up
the
instrument
with
which
david
was
prepared
to
carry
out
my
orders
was
a
formidable
one
in
the
days
of
my
youth
my
family
was
very
fond
of
maryland
biscuit
which
owes
much
of
its
delicacy
to
the
fact
that
before
baking
it
is
pounded
and
beaten
by
a
piece
of
heavy
iron
some
people
used
one
kind
of
a
beater
and
some
another
but
we
had
had
made
for
the
purpose
a
heavy
iron
club
a
little
over
a
foot
long
large
and
heavy
at
one
end
and
a
handle
at
the
other
in
my
present
household
maryland
biscuits
were
never
made
but
i
had
preserved
this
iron
beater
as
a
memento
of
my
boyhood
and
when
the
burglaries
began
in
our
vicinity
i
gave
it
to
david
to
keep
in
his
room
to
be
used
as
a
weapon
if
necessary
i
did
not
allow
him
to
have
a
pistol
having
a
regard
for
my
own
safety
in
a
sudden
night
alarm
and
nothing
could
be
more
formidable
in
a
encounter
than
this
club
i
began
with
the
tall
man
and
rapidly
tied
his
feet
together
with
many
twists
of
the
rope
and
as
many
knots
i
then
turned
him
over
and
tied
his
elbows
behind
him
in
the
same
secure
way
i
had
given
so
much
thought
to
the
best
method
of
securing
a
man
by
cords
that
i
do
not
think
this
fellow
could
possibly
have
released
himself
when
i
had
finished
with
him
david
was
obeying
my
orders
and
keeping
a
strict
watch
on
the
prostrate
men
but
his
emotions
of
amazement
were
so
great
that
he
could
not
keep
them
down
what
is
the
matter
with
them
sir
he
said
how
did
they
come
so
there
is
no
time
for
talking
now
i
answered
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
when
the
men
have
been
secured
i
now
turned
my
attention
to
the
man
who
was
partly
resting
against
the
lounge
i
first
tied
his
feet
and
before
letting
him
down
to
the
floor
so
as
to
get
to
his
arms
i
removed
his
hat
and
his
mask
which
was
made
of
black
muslin
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
beardless
face
of
a
young
and
very
man
he
was
well
dressed
and
had
the
general
appearance
of
a
person
belonging
to
theatrical
circles
when
his
arms
had
been
tied
i
told
david
he
might
lay
down
his
and
help
me
with
the
third
man
who
was
badly
mixed
up
with
the
of
the
refreshments
we
hauled
him
out
and
tied
him
up
he
was
rather
a
short
man
but
very
heavy
and
i
could
see
no
signs
of
his
having
been
hurt
by
the
he
made
in
falling
we
now
proceeded
to
search
the
insensible
burglars
for
arms
upon
the
tall
man
we
found
a
large
revolver
a
heavy
billy
which
seemed
as
if
it
had
seen
service
and
a
knife
the
stout
man
carried
two
pistols
and
upon
one
of
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
wore
a
brass
ring
with
a
iron
protuberance
upon
it
which
when
driven
forward
by
his
powerful
arm
was
probably
more
dangerous
than
a
billy
upon
the
younger
man
we
found
no
arms
at
all
and
his
hip
pocket
contained
nothing
but
a
small
handbook
on
civil
engineering
i
now
briefly
explained
to
david
the
nature
of
the
trap
which
had
caught
the
burglars
he
gazed
upon
me
with
a
face
glowing
with
amazed
admiration
what
a
head
you
have
got
sir
he
exclaimed
i
do
believe
there
is
another
man
in
this
state
who
would
have
thought
of
that
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
now
sir
hang
that
what
ought
to
be
done
with
them
the
hounds
all
i
shall
do
i
answered
will
be
to
keep
them
till
daylight
and
then
i
shall
send
word
to
the
sheriff
at
kennertown
and
have
him
send
officers
for
them
upon
my
word
exclaimed
david
they
are
in
the
worst
kind
of
a
box
now
my
wife
called
me
again
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
down
there
she
called
why
do
you
come
upstairs
this
annoyed
me
for
i
was
not
yet
ready
to
go
upstairs
i
wished
to
resuscitate
these
fellows
for
their
stupor
was
so
profound
that
i
began
to
fear
that
perhaps
they
had
taken
too
much
of
the
drug
and
ought
to
be
brought
to
their
senses
as
speedily
as
possible
this
feeling
was
due
more
to
my
desire
that
serious
injuries
should
not
occur
to
the
rascals
while
in
my
house
than
to
any
concern
for
them
my
dear
said
i
stepping
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
i
have
some
things
to
attend
to
down
here
which
will
occupy
me
a
few
minutes
longer
then
i
will
come
up
to
you
i
ca
imagine
what
the
things
are
she
said
but
i
suppose
i
can
wait
and
she
went
into
her
room
and
closed
her
door
after
her
i
now
began
to
consider
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
burglars
after
they
had
been
resuscitated
my
first
impulse
was
to
rid
the
house
of
them
by
carrying
them
out
of
doors
and
bringing
them
to
their
senses
there
but
there
was
an
objection
to
this
plan
they
would
be
pretty
heavy
fellows
to
carry
and
as
it
would
be
absolutely
necessary
to
watch
them
until
they
could
be
given
into
the
charge
of
the
officers
of
the
law
i
did
not
want
to
stay
out
of
doors
to
do
this
for
the
night
air
was
raw
and
chilly
and
i
therefore
determined
to
keep
them
in
the
house
and
as
they
could
be
resuscitated
better
in
a
sitting
position
they
must
be
set
up
in
some
way
or
other
i
consulted
david
on
the
subject
you
might
put
up
with
their
backs
agin
the
wall
sir
said
he
but
the
dirty
beasts
would
spoil
the
paper
i
would
keep
them
in
a
decent
room
like
this
i
haul
out
into
the
kitchen
anyway
but
as
they
were
already
in
the
library
i
decided
to
let
them
stay
there
and
to
get
them
as
speedily
as
possible
into
some
position
in
which
they
might
remain
i
bethought
me
of
a
heavy
wooden
settle
or
bench
with
back
and
arms
which
stood
on
the
side
piazza
with
help
i
brought
this
into
the
room
and
placed
it
with
its
back
to
the
window
now
then
said
i
to
david
we
will
put
them
on
this
bench
and
i
will
tie
them
fast
to
it
we
can
not
be
too
careful
in
securing
them
for
if
one
of
them
were
to
get
loose
even
without
arms
there
is
no
knowing
what
trouble
he
might
make
well
sir
said
david
if
i
to
handle
them
at
all
i
rather
have
them
dead
as
i
hope
they
are
than
have
them
alive
but
you
need
be
afraid
sir
that
any
one
of
them
will
get
loose
if
i
see
any
signs
of
that
i
crack
the
rascal
skull
in
a
jiffy
it
required
a
great
deal
of
tugging
and
lifting
to
get
those
three
men
on
the
bench
but
we
got
them
there
side
by
side
their
heads
hanging
listlessly
some
one
way
some
another
i
then
tied
each
one
of
them
firmly
to
the
bench
i
had
scarcely
finished
this
when
i
again
heard
my
wife
voice
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
if
any
pipes
have
burst
she
called
down
tell
david
not
to
catch
the
water
in
the
new
very
well
i
replied
i
see
to
it
and
was
rejoiced
to
hear
again
the
shutting
of
the
bedroom
door
i
now
saturated
a
sponge
with
the
powerful
preparation
which
marks
had
prepared
as
an
antidote
and
held
it
under
the
nose
of
the
tall
burglar
in
less
than
twenty
seconds
he
made
a
slight
quivering
in
his
face
as
if
he
were
about
to
sneeze
and
very
soon
he
did
sneeze
slightly
then
he
sneezed
violently
raised
his
head
and
opened
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
gazed
blankly
before
him
and
then
looked
stupidly
at
david
and
at
me
but
in
an
instant
there
flashed
into
his
face
the
look
of
a
wild
beast
his
quick
glittering
eye
took
in
the
whole
situation
at
a
glance
with
a
furious
oath
he
threw
himself
forward
with
such
a
powerful
movement
that
he
nearly
lifted
the
bench
stop
that
said
david
who
stood
near
him
with
his
iron
club
uplifted
if
you
do
that
again
i
let
you
feel
this
the
man
looked
at
him
with
a
fiery
flash
in
his
eyes
and
then
he
looked
at
me
as
i
stood
holding
the
muzzle
of
my
pistol
within
two
feet
of
his
face
the
black
and
red
faded
out
of
his
countenance
he
became
pale
he
glanced
at
his
companions
bound
and
helpless
his
expression
now
changed
entirely
the
fury
of
the
wild
beast
was
succeeded
by
a
look
of
frightened
subjection
gazing
very
anxiously
at
my
pistol
he
said
in
a
voice
which
though
agitated
was
low
and
respectful
what
does
this
mean
what
are
you
going
to
do
will
you
please
turn
away
the
muzzle
of
that
pistol
i
took
no
notice
of
this
indication
of
my
steadiness
of
hand
and
answered
i
am
going
to
bring
these
other
scoundrels
to
their
senses
and
early
in
the
morning
the
three
of
you
will
be
on
your
way
to
jail
where
i
hope
you
may
remain
for
the
rest
of
your
lives
if
you
do
get
killed
on
your
way
there
said
david
in
whose
nervous
hand
the
heavy
was
almost
as
dangerous
as
my
pistol
the
stout
man
who
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
bench
was
twice
as
long
in
reviving
as
had
been
his
companion
who
watched
the
operation
with
intense
interest
when
the
burly
scoundrel
finally
became
conscious
he
sat
for
a
few
minutes
gazing
at
the
floor
with
a
silly
grin
then
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
first
at
one
of
his
companions
and
then
at
the
other
gazed
for
an
instant
at
me
and
david
tried
to
move
his
feet
gave
a
pull
at
one
arm
and
then
at
the
other
and
when
he
found
he
was
bound
hard
and
fast
his
face
turned
as
red
as
fire
and
he
opened
his
mouth
whether
to
swear
or
yell
i
know
not
i
had
already
closed
the
door
and
before
the
man
had
uttered
more
than
a
premonitory
sound
david
had
clapped
the
end
of
his
bludgeon
against
his
mouth
taste
that
he
said
and
you
know
what
you
will
get
if
you
disturb
this
family
with
any
of
your
vile
cursin
and
swearin
look
here
said
the
tall
man
suddenly
turning
to
the
other
with
an
air
of
authority
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
do
speak
till
spoken
to
mind
that
now
or
these
gentlemen
will
make
it
the
worse
for
you
david
grinned
as
he
took
away
his
club
i
gentlemen
you
he
said
if
i
could
get
half
a
chance
to
do
it
the
face
of
the
heavy
burglar
maintained
its
redness
but
he
kept
his
mouth
shut
when
the
younger
man
was
restored
to
his
senses
his
full
consciousness
and
power
of
perception
seemed
to
come
to
him
in
an
instant
his
eyes
flashed
from
right
to
left
he
turned
deadly
white
and
then
merely
moving
his
arms
and
legs
enough
to
make
himself
aware
that
he
was
bound
he
sat
perfectly
still
and
said
not
a
word
i
now
felt
that
i
must
go
and
acquaint
my
wife
with
what
had
happened
or
otherwise
she
would
be
coming
downstairs
to
see
what
was
keeping
me
so
long
david
declared
that
he
was
perfectly
able
to
keep
guard
over
them
and
i
ran
upstairs
david
afterward
told
me
that
as
soon
as
i
left
the
room
the
tall
burglar
endeavoured
to
bribe
him
to
cut
their
ropes
and
told
him
if
he
was
afraid
to
stay
behind
after
doing
this
he
would
get
him
a
much
better
situation
than
this
could
possibly
be
but
as
david
threatened
personal
injury
to
the
speaker
if
he
uttered
another
word
of
the
kind
the
tall
man
said
no
more
but
the
stout
man
became
very
violent
and
angry
threatening
all
sorts
of
vengeance
on
my
unfortunate
man
david
said
he
was
beginning
to
get
angry
when
the
tall
man
who
seemed
to
have
much
influence
over
the
other
fellow
ordered
him
to
keep
quiet
as
the
gentleman
with
the
iron
club
no
doubt
thought
he
was
doing
right
the
young
fellow
never
said
a
word
when
i
told
my
wife
that
i
had
caught
three
burglars
and
they
were
fast
bound
in
the
library
she
nearly
fainted
and
when
i
had
revived
her
she
begged
me
to
promise
that
i
would
not
go
downstairs
again
until
the
police
had
carried
away
the
horrible
wretches
but
i
assured
her
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
me
to
return
to
the
library
she
then
declared
that
she
would
go
with
me
and
if
anything
happened
she
would
share
my
fate
besides
she
said
if
they
are
tied
fast
so
they
ca
move
i
should
like
to
see
what
they
look
like
i
never
saw
a
burglar
i
did
not
wish
my
wife
to
go
downstairs
but
as
i
knew
there
would
be
no
use
in
objecting
i
consented
she
hastily
dressed
herself
making
me
wait
for
her
and
when
she
left
the
room
she
locked
the
door
on
the
sleeping
george
william
in
order
that
no
one
should
get
at
him
during
her
absence
as
we
passed
the
head
of
the
stairs
the
door
of
my
aunt
martha
room
opened
and
there
she
stood
completely
dressed
with
her
bonnet
on
and
a
little
leather
bag
in
her
hand
i
heard
so
much
talking
and
so
much
going
up
and
down
stairs
that
i
thought
i
had
better
be
ready
to
do
whatever
had
to
be
done
is
it
fire
no
said
my
wife
it
three
burglars
tied
in
a
bunch
in
the
library
i
am
going
down
to
see
them
my
aunt
martha
gasped
and
looked
as
if
she
were
going
to
sit
down
on
the
floor
goodness
gracious
she
said
if
you
going
i
go
too
i
ca
let
you
go
alone
and
i
never
did
see
a
burglar
i
hurried
down
and
left
the
two
ladies
on
the
stairs
until
i
was
sure
everything
was
still
safe
and
when
i
saw
that
there
had
been
no
change
in
the
state
of
affairs
i
told
them
to
come
down
when
my
wife
and
aunt
martha
timidly
looked
in
at
the
library
door
the
effect
upon
them
and
the
burglars
was
equally
interesting
the
ladies
each
gave
a
start
and
a
little
scream
and
huddled
themselves
close
to
me
and
the
three
burglars
gazed
at
them
with
faces
that
expressed
more
astonishment
than
any
i
had
ever
seen
before
the
stout
fellow
gave
vent
to
a
smothered
exclamation
and
the
face
of
the
young
man
flushed
but
not
one
of
them
spoke
are
you
sure
they
are
tied
fast
whispered
my
aunt
martha
to
me
perfectly
i
answered
if
i
had
not
been
sure
i
should
not
have
allowed
you
to
come
down
thereupon
the
ladies
picked
up
courage
and
stepped
further
into
the
room
did
you
and
david
catch
them
asked
my
aunt
and
how
in
the
world
did
you
do
it
i
tell
you
all
about
that
another
time
i
said
and
you
had
better
go
upstairs
as
soon
as
you
two
have
seen
what
sort
of
people
are
these
cowardly
burglars
who
sneak
or
break
into
the
houses
of
respectable
people
at
night
and
rob
and
steal
and
ruin
other
people
property
with
no
more
conscience
or
human
feeling
than
is
possessed
by
the
rats
which
steal
your
corn
or
the
polecats
which
kill
your
chickens
i
can
scarcely
believe
said
aunt
martha
that
that
young
man
is
a
real
burglar
at
these
words
the
eyes
of
the
fellow
spoken
of
glowed
as
he
fixed
them
on
aunt
martha
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
and
the
paleness
which
had
returned
to
his
face
did
not
change
have
they
told
you
who
they
are
asked
my
wife
i
have
asked
them
i
said
and
now
do
you
think
you
had
better
go
upstairs
it
seems
to
me
said
aunt
martha
that
those
ropes
must
hurt
them
the
tall
man
now
spoke
indeed
they
do
madam
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
very
respectful
manner
they
are
very
tight
i
told
david
to
look
at
all
the
cords
and
see
if
any
of
them
were
too
tightly
drawn
it
all
nonsense
sir
said
he
when
he
had
finished
the
examination
not
one
of
the
ropes
is
a
bit
too
tight
all
they
want
is
a
chance
to
pull
out
their
ugly
hands
of
course
said
aunt
martha
if
it
would
be
unsafe
to
loosen
the
knots
i
would
do
it
are
they
to
be
sent
to
prison
yes
said
i
as
soon
as
the
day
breaks
i
shall
send
down
for
the
police
i
now
heard
a
slight
sound
at
the
door
and
turning
saw
alice
our
maid
of
the
house
who
was
peeping
in
at
the
door
alice
was
a
modest
girl
and
quite
pretty
i
heard
the
noise
and
the
talking
sir
she
said
and
when
i
found
the
ladies
had
gone
down
to
see
what
it
was
i
thought
i
would
come
too
and
where
is
the
cook
asked
my
wife
do
she
want
to
see
burglars
not
a
bit
of
it
answered
alice
very
emphatically
as
soon
as
i
told
her
what
it
was
she
covered
up
her
head
with
the
bedclothes
and
declared
that
she
would
never
get
up
until
they
were
entirely
gone
out
of
the
house
at
this
the
stout
man
grinned
i
wish
you
all
cover
up
your
heads
he
said
the
tall
man
looked
at
him
severely
and
he
said
no
more
david
did
not
move
from
his
post
near
the
three
burglars
but
he
turned
toward
alice
and
looked
at
her
we
knew
that
he
had
tender
feelings
toward
the
girl
and
i
think
that
he
did
not
approve
of
her
being
there
have
they
stolen
anything
asked
aunt
martha
they
have
not
had
any
chance
to
take
anything
away
i
said
and
my
wife
remarked
that
whether
they
had
stolen
anything
or
not
they
had
made
a
dreadful
mess
on
the
floor
and
had
broken
the
table
they
should
certainly
be
punished
at
this
she
made
a
motion
as
if
she
would
leave
the
room
and
an
anxious
expression
immediately
came
on
the
face
of
the
tall
man
who
had
evidently
been
revolving
something
in
his
mind
madam
he
said
we
are
very
sorry
that
we
have
broken
your
table
and
that
we
have
damaged
some
of
your
glass
and
your
carpet
i
assure
you
however
that
nothing
of
the
kind
would
have
happened
but
for
that
drugged
wine
which
was
doubtless
intended
for
a
medicine
and
not
a
beverage
but
weary
and
chilled
as
we
were
when
we
arrived
madam
we
were
glad
to
partake
of
it
supposing
it
ordinary
wine
i
could
not
help
showing
a
little
pride
at
the
success
of
my
scheme
the
refreshment
was
intended
for
fellows
of
your
class
and
i
am
very
glad
you
accepted
it
the
tall
man
did
not
answer
me
but
he
again
addressed
my
wife
madam
he
said
if
you
ladies
would
remain
and
listen
to
me
a
few
moments
i
am
sure
i
would
make
you
aware
that
there
is
much
to
extenuate
the
apparent
offence
which
i
have
committed
my
wife
did
not
answer
him
but
turning
to
me
said
smiling
if
he
alludes
to
their
drinking
your
wine
he
need
not
apologize
the
man
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
as
if
her
words
had
pained
him
madam
he
said
if
you
consent
to
listen
to
my
explanations
and
the
story
of
this
affair
i
am
sure
your
feelings
toward
me
would
not
be
so
harsh
now
then
said
my
aunt
martha
if
he
has
a
story
to
tell
he
ought
to
be
allowed
to
tell
it
even
in
a
case
like
this
nobody
should
be
judged
until
he
has
said
what
he
thinks
he
ought
to
say
let
us
hear
his
story
i
laughed
any
statement
he
may
make
i
said
will
probably
deserve
a
much
stronger
name
than
stories
i
think
that
what
you
say
is
true
remarked
my
wife
but
still
if
he
has
a
story
to
tell
i
should
like
to
hear
it
i
think
i
heard
david
give
a
little
grunt
but
he
was
too
well
bred
to
say
anything
very
well
said
i
if
you
choose
to
sit
up
and
hear
him
talk
it
is
your
affair
i
shall
be
obliged
to
remain
here
anyway
and
will
not
object
to
anything
that
will
help
to
pass
away
the
time
but
these
men
must
not
be
the
only
ones
who
are
seated
david
you
and
alice
can
clear
away
that
broken
table
and
the
rest
of
the
stuff
and
then
we
might
as
well
sit
down
and
make
ourselves
comfortable
alice
with
cloth
and
brush
approached
very
timidly
the
scene
of
the
disaster
but
the
younger
burglar
who
was
nearest
to
her
gazed
upon
her
with
such
a
gentle
and
quiet
air
that
she
did
not
seem
to
be
frightened
when
she
and
david
had
put
the
room
in
fair
order
i
placed
two
for
my
wife
and
aunt
martha
at
a
moderate
distance
from
the
burglars
and
took
another
myself
a
little
nearer
to
them
and
then
told
david
to
seat
himself
near
the
other
end
of
the
bench
and
alice
took
a
chair
at
a
little
distance
from
the
ladies
now
then
said
aunt
martha
to
the
burglars
i
would
like
very
much
to
hear
what
any
one
of
you
can
say
in
extenuation
of
having
broken
into
a
gentleman
house
by
night
without
hesitation
the
tall
man
began
his
speech
he
had
a
long
and
rather
lean
face
which
at
present
bore
the
expression
of
an
undertaker
conducting
a
funeral
although
it
was
my
aunt
who
had
shown
the
greatest
desire
to
hear
his
story
he
addressed
himself
to
my
wife
i
think
he
imagined
that
she
was
the
more
influential
person
of
the
two
madam
said
he
i
am
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
giving
you
and
your
family
an
idea
of
the
difficulties
and
miseries
which
beset
a
large
class
of
your
of
whom
you
seldom
have
any
chance
of
knowing
anything
at
all
but
of
whom
you
hear
all
sorts
of
the
most
misleading
accounts
now
i
am
a
poor
man
i
have
suffered
the
greatest
miseries
that
poverty
can
inflict
i
am
here
suspected
of
having
committed
a
crime
it
is
possible
that
i
may
be
put
to
considerable
difficulty
and
expense
in
proving
my
innocence
i
should
wonder
i
interrupted
to
this
remark
he
paid
no
attention
considering
all
this
he
continued
you
may
not
suppose
madam
that
as
a
boy
i
was
brought
up
most
respectably
and
properly
my
mother
was
a
religious
woman
and
my
father
was
a
i
was
sent
to
school
and
my
mother
has
often
told
me
that
i
was
a
good
scholar
but
she
died
when
i
was
about
sixteen
and
i
am
sure
had
this
not
happened
i
should
never
have
been
even
suspected
of
breaking
the
laws
of
my
country
not
long
after
her
death
my
father
appeared
to
lose
interest
in
his
business
and
took
to
rowing
about
the
river
instead
of
building
boats
for
other
people
to
row
very
often
he
went
out
at
night
and
i
used
to
wonder
why
he
should
care
to
be
on
the
water
in
the
darkness
and
sometimes
in
the
rain
one
evening
at
supper
he
said
to
me
you
ought
to
know
how
to
row
in
the
dark
as
well
as
in
the
daytime
i
am
going
up
the
river
and
you
can
come
with
me
it
was
about
my
ordinary
bedtime
when
we
took
a
boat
with
two
pair
of
oars
and
we
pulled
up
the
river
about
three
miles
above
the
city
what
city
i
asked
the
city
where
i
was
born
sir
he
said
and
the
name
of
which
i
must
be
excused
from
mentioning
for
reasons
connected
with
my
only
surviving
parent
there
were
houses
on
the
river
bank
but
they
were
not
very
near
each
other
some
of
them
had
lights
in
them
but
most
of
them
were
dark
as
it
must
have
been
after
eleven
before
one
of
them
my
father
stopped
rowing
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
it
pretty
hard
it
seemed
to
be
all
dark
but
as
we
pulled
on
a
little
i
saw
a
light
in
the
back
of
the
house
my
father
said
nothing
but
we
kept
on
though
pulling
very
easy
for
a
mile
or
two
and
then
we
turned
and
floated
down
with
the
tide
might
as
well
rest
thomas
said
he
you
have
worked
pretty
hard
we
floated
slowly
for
the
tide
was
just
beginning
to
turn
and
when
we
got
near
the
house
which
i
mentioned
i
noticed
that
there
was
no
light
in
it
when
we
were
about
opposite
to
it
father
suddenly
looked
up
and
said
not
speaking
very
loud
george
if
that
is
williamson
green
house
i
was
thinking
of
it
when
we
rowed
up
and
passed
it
without
taking
notice
of
it
i
am
sorry
for
that
for
i
wanted
to
see
williamson
and
now
i
expect
he
has
gone
to
bed
is
mr
green
i
asked
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
said
my
father
i
have
seen
him
for
some
little
while
now
about
four
months
ago
he
borrowed
of
me
a
sextant
quadrant
and
chronometer
they
were
instruments
i
took
from
old
captain
barney
in
payment
of
some
work
i
did
for
him
i
usin
them
and
williamson
had
bought
a
catboat
and
was
studying
navigation
but
he
has
given
up
that
fad
now
and
has
promised
me
over
and
over
to
send
me
back
my
instruments
but
he
has
never
done
it
if
i
thought
of
it
i
would
have
stopped
and
got
of
him
but
i
think
and
now
i
expect
he
has
gone
to
bed
however
i
row
in
shore
and
see
perhaps
he
up
yet
you
see
said
the
speaker
to
my
wife
i
tellin
you
all
these
particulars
because
i
am
very
anxious
you
should
understand
exactly
how
everything
happened
on
this
night
which
was
the
of
my
life
very
good
said
aunt
martha
we
want
to
hear
all
the
particulars
well
then
continued
the
burglar
we
pulled
up
to
a
stone
wall
which
was
at
the
bottom
of
green
place
and
made
fast
and
father
he
got
out
and
went
up
to
the
house
after
a
good
while
he
came
back
and
said
that
he
was
pretty
sure
williamson
green
had
gone
to
bed
and
as
it
do
to
waken
people
up
from
their
sleep
to
ask
them
for
nautical
instruments
they
had
borrowed
he
sat
down
for
a
minute
on
the
top
of
the
wall
and
then
he
slapped
his
knee
not
making
much
noise
though
george
he
said
idea
has
just
struck
me
i
can
play
the
prettiest
trick
on
williamson
that
ever
was
played
on
mortal
man
those
instruments
are
all
in
a
box
locked
up
and
i
know
just
where
he
keeps
it
i
saw
it
not
long
ago
when
i
went
to
his
house
to
talk
about
a
yacht
he
wants
built
they
are
on
a
table
in
the
comer
of
his
bedroom
he
was
taking
me
through
the
house
to
show
me
the
improvements
he
had
made
and
he
said
to
me
martin
there
your
instruments
i
wo
trouble
you
to
take
them
with
you
because
they
heavy
and
you
not
going
straight
home
but
i
bring
them
to
you
day
after
when
i
shall
be
goin
your
way
then
said
my
father
trick
i
thinkin
of
playing
on
williamson
is
this
i
like
to
take
that
box
of
instruments
out
of
his
room
without
his
knowing
it
and
carry
them
home
having
the
boat
here
convenient
and
then
in
a
day
or
two
to
write
to
him
and
tell
him
i
must
have
because
i
have
a
special
use
for
of
course
he
be
awfully
cut
up
not
having
them
to
send
back
and
when
he
comes
down
to
my
place
to
talk
about
it
and
after
hearing
all
he
has
to
say
show
him
the
box
he
be
the
most
dumbfoundedest
man
in
this
state
and
if
i
do
choose
to
tell
him
he
never
know
to
his
dying
day
how
i
got
that
box
and
if
he
lies
awake
at
night
trying
to
think
how
i
got
it
it
will
serve
him
right
for
keeping
my
property
from
me
so
long
father
said
i
the
people
have
gone
to
bed
you
ca
get
into
the
house
to
play
him
your
trick
can
be
managed
says
he
rather
old
for
climbing
myself
but
i
know
a
way
by
which
you
thomas
can
get
in
easy
enough
at
the
back
of
the
house
is
a
trellis
with
a
running
over
it
and
the
top
of
it
is
just
under
one
of
the
windows
you
can
climb
up
that
trellis
thomas
and
lift
up
that
very
carefully
so
not
to
make
no
noise
and
get
in
then
you
be
in
a
back
room
with
a
door
right
in
front
of
you
which
opens
into
and
green
bedroom
there
always
a
little
night
lamp
burning
in
it
by
which
you
can
see
to
get
about
in
the
corner
on
your
right
as
you
go
into
the
room
is
a
table
with
my
standing
on
it
the
box
is
pretty
heavy
and
there
is
a
handle
on
top
to
carry
it
by
you
need
be
afraid
to
go
in
for
by
this
time
they
are
both
sound
asleep
and
you
can
pick
up
the
box
and
walk
out
as
gingerly
as
a
cat
having
of
course
taken
your
shoes
off
before
you
went
in
then
you
can
hand
the
box
out
the
back
window
to
me
i
can
climb
up
high
enough
to
reach
it
and
you
can
scuttle
down
and
we
be
off
having
the
best
rig
on
williamson
green
that
i
ever
heard
of
in
my
born
days
i
was
a
very
active
boy
used
to
climbing
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
had
no
doubt
that
i
could
easily
get
into
the
house
but
i
did
not
fancy
my
father
scheme
i
said
williamson
green
should
wake
up
and
see
me
what
could
i
say
how
could
i
explain
my
situation
need
say
anything
said
my
father
he
wakes
up
blow
out
the
light
and
scoot
if
you
happen
to
have
the
box
in
your
hand
drop
it
out
the
back
window
and
then
slip
down
after
it
he
wo
see
us
but
if
he
does
he
can
not
catch
us
before
we
get
to
the
boat
but
if
he
should
however
i
have
to
explain
the
matter
to
him
and
the
joke
will
be
against
me
but
i
shall
get
my
instruments
which
is
the
main
point
after
all
i
did
not
argue
with
my
father
for
he
was
a
man
who
hated
to
be
differed
with
and
i
agreed
to
help
him
carry
out
his
little
joke
we
took
off
our
shoes
and
walked
quietly
to
the
back
of
the
house
my
father
stood
below
and
i
climbed
up
the
trellis
under
the
back
window
which
he
pointed
out
the
was
down
all
but
a
little
crack
to
let
in
air
and
i
raised
it
so
slowly
and
gently
that
i
made
no
noise
then
without
any
trouble
at
all
i
got
into
the
room
i
found
myself
in
a
chamber
into
which
a
faint
light
came
from
a
door
opposite
the
window
having
been
several
hours
out
in
the
night
my
eyes
had
become
so
accustomed
to
darkness
that
this
light
was
comparatively
strong
and
i
could
see
everything
looking
about
me
my
eyes
fell
on
a
little
bedstead
on
which
lay
one
of
the
most
beautiful
infants
i
ever
beheld
in
my
life
its
golden
hair
lay
in
ringlets
upon
the
pillow
its
eyes
were
closed
but
its
soft
cheeks
had
in
them
a
rosy
tinge
which
almost
equalled
the
colour
of
its
dainty
little
lips
slightly
opened
as
it
softly
breathed
and
dreamed
at
this
point
i
saw
my
wife
look
quickly
at
the
bedroom
key
she
had
in
her
hand
i
knew
she
was
thinking
of
george
william
i
stood
entranced
continued
the
burglar
gazing
upon
this
babe
for
i
was
very
fond
of
children
but
i
remembered
that
i
must
not
waste
time
and
stepped
softly
into
the
next
room
there
i
beheld
and
williamson
green
in
bed
both
fast
asleep
the
gentleman
breathing
a
little
hard
in
a
corner
just
where
my
father
told
me
i
should
find
it
stood
the
box
upon
the
table
but
i
could
not
immediately
pick
it
up
and
depart
the
beautiful
room
in
which
i
found
myself
was
a
revelation
to
me
until
that
moment
i
had
not
known
that
i
had
tastes
and
sympathies
of
a
higher
order
than
might
have
been
expected
of
the
youthful
son
of
a
those
artistic
furnishings
aroused
within
a
love
of
the
beautiful
which
i
did
not
know
i
possessed
the
carpets
the
walls
the
pictures
the
hangings
in
the
windows
the
furniture
the
ornaments
everything
in
fact
impressed
me
with
such
a
delight
that
i
did
not
wish
to
move
or
go
away
into
my
young
soul
there
came
a
longing
i
said
to
myself
my
parents
had
belonged
to
the
same
social
grade
as
that
worthy
couple
reposing
in
that
bed
and
oh
that
i
in
my
infancy
had
been
as
beautiful
and
as
likely
to
be
so
carefully
nurtured
and
cultured
as
that
sweet
babe
in
the
next
room
i
almost
heaved
a
sigh
as
i
thought
of
the
difference
between
these
surroundings
and
my
own
but
i
checked
myself
it
would
not
do
to
made
a
noise
and
spoil
my
father
joke
there
were
a
great
many
things
in
that
luxurious
apartment
which
it
would
have
delighted
me
to
look
upon
and
examine
but
i
forbore
i
wish
i
been
there
said
the
stout
man
there
would
have
been
any
forbearin
the
speaker
turned
sharply
upon
him
do
you
interrupt
me
again
he
said
angrily
then
instantly
resuming
his
deferential
tone
he
continued
the
story
but
i
had
come
there
by
the
command
of
my
parent
and
this
command
must
be
obeyed
without
trifling
or
loss
of
time
my
father
did
not
approve
of
trifling
or
loss
of
time
i
moved
quietly
toward
the
table
in
the
corner
on
which
stood
my
father
box
i
was
just
about
to
put
my
hand
upon
it
when
i
heard
a
slight
movement
behind
me
i
gave
a
start
and
glanced
backward
it
was
williamson
green
turning
over
in
his
bed
what
if
he
should
awake
his
back
was
now
toward
me
and
my
impulse
was
to
fly
and
leave
everything
behind
me
but
my
father
had
ordered
me
to
bring
the
box
and
he
expected
his
orders
to
be
obeyed
i
had
often
been
convinced
of
that
i
stood
perfectly
motionless
for
a
minute
or
so
and
when
the
gentleman
recommenced
his
regular
and
very
audible
breathing
i
felt
it
safe
to
proceed
with
my
task
taking
hold
of
the
box
i
found
it
was
much
heavier
than
i
expected
it
to
be
but
i
moved
gently
away
with
it
and
passed
into
the
back
room
there
i
could
not
refrain
from
stopping
a
moment
by
the
side
of
the
sleeping
babe
upon
whose
face
the
light
of
the
night
lamp
dimly
shone
the
little
child
was
still
sleeping
sweetly
and
my
impulse
was
to
stop
and
kiss
it
but
i
knew
that
this
would
be
wrong
the
infant
might
awake
and
utter
a
cry
and
my
father
joke
be
spoiled
i
moved
to
the
open
window
and
with
some
trouble
and
i
think
without
any
noise
i
succeeded
in
getting
out
upon
the
trellis
with
the
box
under
my
arm
the
descent
was
awkward
but
my
father
was
a
tall
man
and
reaching
upward
relieved
me
of
my
burden
before
i
got
to
the
ground
did
remember
it
was
so
heavy
he
whispered
i
should
have
given
you
a
rope
to
lower
it
down
by
if
you
had
dropped
it
and
spoiled
my
instruments
and
made
a
lot
of
noise
besides
i
should
have
been
angry
enough
i
was
very
glad
my
father
was
not
angry
and
following
him
over
the
greensward
we
quickly
reached
the
boat
where
the
box
was
stowed
away
under
the
bow
to
keep
it
from
injury
we
pushed
off
as
quietly
as
possible
and
rowed
swiftly
down
the
river
when
we
had
gone
about
a
mile
i
suddenly
dropped
my
oar
with
an
exclamation
of
dismay
the
matter
cried
my
father
i
have
done
a
dreadful
thing
i
said
father
i
must
go
back
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
at
this
my
father
swore
do
you
want
to
go
back
for
he
said
to
think
of
it
i
have
left
open
the
window
in
which
that
beautiful
child
was
sleeping
if
it
should
take
cold
and
die
from
the
damp
air
of
the
river
blowing
upon
it
i
should
never
forgive
myself
oh
if
i
had
only
thought
of
climbing
up
the
trellis
again
and
pulling
down
that
sash
i
am
sure
i
could
go
back
and
do
it
without
making
the
least
noise
my
father
gave
a
grunt
but
what
the
grunt
meant
i
do
not
know
and
for
a
few
moments
he
was
silent
and
then
he
said
you
can
not
go
back
the
distance
is
too
great
the
tide
is
against
us
and
it
is
time
that
you
and
i
were
both
in
our
beds
nothing
may
happen
to
that
baby
but
attend
to
my
words
now
if
any
harm
should
come
to
that
child
it
will
go
hard
with
you
if
it
should
die
it
would
be
of
no
use
for
you
to
talk
about
practical
jokes
you
would
be
held
responsible
for
its
death
i
was
going
to
say
to
you
that
it
might
be
as
well
for
you
not
to
say
anything
about
this
little
venture
until
i
had
seen
how
williamson
green
took
the
joke
some
people
get
angry
with
very
little
reason
although
i
hardly
believe
he
that
sort
of
a
man
but
now
things
are
different
he
thinks
all
the
world
of
that
child
which
is
the
only
one
they
got
and
if
you
want
to
stay
outside
of
jail
or
the
house
of
refuge
i
warn
you
never
to
say
a
word
of
where
you
have
been
this
night
with
this
he
began
to
row
again
and
i
followed
his
example
but
with
a
very
heavy
heart
all
that
night
i
dreamt
of
the
little
child
with
the
damp
night
winds
blowing
in
upon
it
did
you
ever
hear
if
it
caught
cold
asked
aunt
martha
no
replied
the
burglar
i
never
did
i
mentioned
the
matter
to
my
father
and
he
said
that
he
had
great
fears
upon
the
subject
for
although
he
had
written
to
williamson
green
asking
him
to
return
the
instruments
he
had
not
seen
him
or
heard
from
him
and
he
was
afraid
that
the
child
had
died
or
was
dangerously
sick
shortly
after
that
my
father
sent
me
on
a
little
trip
to
the
long
island
coast
to
collect
some
bills
from
people
for
whom
he
had
done
work
he
gave
me
money
to
stay
a
week
or
two
at
the
seashore
saying
that
the
change
would
do
me
good
and
it
was
while
i
was
away
on
this
delightful
holiday
that
an
event
occurred
which
had
a
most
disastrous
effect
upon
my
future
life
my
father
was
arrested
for
burglary
it
appeared
and
i
can
not
tell
you
how
shocked
i
was
when
i
discovered
the
truth
that
the
box
which
i
had
carried
away
did
not
contain
nautical
instruments
but
was
filled
with
valuable
plate
and
jewels
my
unfortunate
father
heard
from
a
man
who
had
been
discharged
from
the
service
of
the
family
whose
house
he
had
visited
whose
name
by
the
way
was
not
green
where
the
box
containing
the
valuables
mentioned
was
always
placed
at
night
and
he
had
also
received
accurate
information
in
regard
to
the
situation
of
the
rooms
and
the
best
method
of
gaining
access
to
them
i
believe
that
some
arrangement
had
been
made
between
my
father
and
this
discharged
servant
in
regard
to
a
division
of
the
contents
of
the
box
and
it
was
on
account
of
a
disagreement
on
this
subject
that
the
man
became
very
angry
and
after
pocketing
what
my
father
thought
was
his
fair
share
he
departed
to
unknown
regions
leaving
behind
a
note
to
the
police
which
led
to
my
father
arrest
that
was
a
mean
trick
said
aunt
martha
the
burglar
looked
at
her
gratefully
in
the
lower
spheres
of
life
madam
such
things
often
happen
some
of
the
plate
and
jewels
were
found
in
my
father
possession
and
he
was
speedily
tried
and
sentenced
to
a
long
term
of
imprisonment
and
now
can
you
imagine
ladies
said
the
tall
burglar
apparently
having
become
satisfied
to
address
himself
to
aunt
martha
as
well
as
my
wife
the
wretched
position
in
which
i
found
myself
i
was
upbraided
as
the
son
of
a
thief
i
soon
found
myself
without
home
without
occupation
and
alas
without
good
reputation
i
was
careful
not
to
mention
my
voluntary
connection
with
my
father
crime
for
fear
that
should
i
do
so
i
might
be
compelled
to
make
a
statement
which
might
increase
the
severity
of
his
punishment
for
this
reason
i
did
not
dare
to
make
inquiries
concerning
the
child
in
whom
i
had
taken
such
an
interest
and
whose
little
life
i
had
perhaps
imperilled
i
never
knew
ladies
whether
that
infant
grew
up
or
not
but
i
alas
grew
up
to
a
life
of
hardship
and
degradation
it
would
be
impossible
for
persons
in
your
sphere
of
life
to
understand
what
i
now
was
obliged
to
suffer
suitable
employment
i
could
not
obtain
because
i
was
the
son
of
a
burglar
with
a
father
in
the
state
prison
it
was
of
no
use
for
me
to
apply
for
employment
at
any
respectable
place
of
business
i
laboured
at
one
thing
and
another
sometimes
engaging
in
the
most
menial
employments
i
also
had
been
educated
and
brought
up
by
my
dear
mother
for
a
very
different
career
sometimes
i
managed
to
live
fairly
well
sometimes
i
suffered
always
i
suffered
from
the
stigma
of
my
father
crime
always
in
the
eyes
of
the
community
in
which
i
lived
a
community
i
am
sorry
to
say
incapable
as
a
rule
of
making
correct
judgments
in
delicate
cases
like
these
i
was
looked
upon
as
belonging
to
the
ranks
of
the
dishonest
it
was
a
hard
lot
and
sometimes
almost
impossible
to
bear
up
under
i
have
spoken
at
length
ladies
in
order
that
you
may
understand
my
true
position
and
i
wish
to
say
that
i
have
never
felt
the
crushing
weight
of
my
father
disgrace
more
deeply
than
i
felt
it
last
evening
this
man
nodding
toward
the
stout
burglar
came
to
me
shortly
after
i
had
eaten
my
supper
which
happened
to
be
a
frugal
one
and
said
to
me
i
have
some
business
to
attend
to
in
which
you
can
help
me
if
you
choose
i
know
you
are
a
good
mechanic
it
is
work
that
will
pay
me
i
answered
should
be
very
glad
to
do
it
for
i
am
greatly
in
need
of
money
will
pay
said
he
and
i
agreed
to
assist
him
as
we
were
walking
to
the
station
as
the
business
to
be
attended
to
was
out
of
town
this
man
whose
name
is
james
barlow
talked
to
me
in
such
a
way
that
i
began
to
suspect
that
he
intended
to
commit
a
burglary
and
openly
charged
him
with
this
evil
purpose
may
call
it
burglary
or
anything
else
you
please
said
he
is
very
unequally
divided
in
this
world
and
it
is
my
business
in
life
to
make
wrong
things
right
as
far
as
i
can
i
am
going
to
the
house
of
a
man
who
has
a
great
deal
more
than
he
needs
and
i
have
anything
like
as
much
as
i
need
and
so
i
intend
to
take
some
of
his
overplus
not
very
much
for
when
i
leave
his
house
he
will
still
be
a
rich
man
and
be
a
poor
one
but
for
a
time
my
family
will
not
starve
as
you
please
james
barlow
i
said
you
are
going
to
do
is
nothing
less
than
burglary
course
it
is
said
he
it
all
right
all
the
same
there
are
a
lot
of
people
thomas
who
are
not
as
particular
about
these
things
as
they
used
to
be
and
there
is
no
use
for
you
to
seem
better
than
your
friends
and
acquaintances
now
to
show
there
are
not
so
many
bigots
as
there
used
to
be
there
a
young
man
going
to
meet
us
at
the
station
who
is
greatly
interested
in
the
study
of
social
problems
he
is
going
along
with
us
just
to
look
into
this
sort
of
thing
and
study
it
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
understand
people
of
our
class
or
do
anything
to
make
their
condition
better
if
he
does
not
thoroughly
investigate
their
methods
of
life
and
action
he
going
along
just
as
a
student
nothing
more
and
he
may
be
down
on
the
whole
thing
for
all
i
know
he
pays
me
five
dollars
for
the
privilege
of
accompanying
me
and
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
is
his
business
i
want
you
to
go
along
as
a
mechanic
and
if
your
conscience
wo
let
you
take
any
share
in
the
profit
i
just
pay
you
for
your
time
barlow
said
i
am
going
with
you
but
for
a
purpose
far
different
from
that
you
desire
i
shall
keep
by
your
side
and
if
i
can
dissuade
you
from
committing
the
crime
you
intend
i
shall
do
so
but
if
i
fail
in
this
and
you
deliberately
break
into
a
house
for
purposes
of
robbery
i
shall
arouse
the
inmates
and
frustrate
your
crime
now
james
barlow
said
he
turning
to
the
stout
man
with
a
severe
expression
on
his
strongly
marked
face
is
not
what
i
have
said
perfectly
true
did
you
not
say
to
me
every
word
which
i
have
just
repeated
the
stout
man
looked
at
the
other
in
a
very
odd
way
his
face
seemed
to
broaden
and
redden
and
he
merely
closed
his
eyes
as
he
promptly
answered
that
just
what
i
said
every
blasted
word
of
it
you
told
it
fair
and
square
leavin
off
nothin
and
puttin
in
nothin
you
told
the
true
facts
out
and
out
up
and
down
without
a
break
now
ladies
continued
the
tall
man
you
see
my
story
is
corroborated
and
i
will
conclude
it
by
saying
that
when
this
house
in
spite
of
my
protest
had
been
opened
i
entered
with
the
others
with
the
firm
intention
of
stepping
into
a
hallway
or
some
other
suitable
place
and
announcing
in
a
loud
voice
that
the
house
was
about
to
be
robbed
as
soon
as
i
found
the
family
aroused
and
my
purpose
accomplished
i
intended
to
depart
as
quickly
as
possible
for
on
account
of
the
shadow
cast
upon
me
by
my
father
crime
i
must
never
be
found
even
in
the
vicinity
of
criminal
action
but
as
i
was
passing
through
this
room
i
could
not
resist
the
invitation
of
barlow
to
partake
of
the
refreshments
which
we
saw
upon
the
table
i
was
faint
from
fatigue
and
insufficient
nourishment
it
seemed
a
very
little
thing
to
taste
a
drop
of
wine
in
a
house
where
i
was
about
to
confer
a
great
benefit
i
yielded
to
the
temptation
and
now
i
am
punished
partaking
even
that
little
which
did
not
belong
to
me
i
find
myself
placed
in
my
present
embarrassing
position
you
are
right
there
said
i
it
must
be
embarrassing
but
before
we
have
any
more
reflections
there
are
some
practical
points
about
which
i
wish
you
would
inform
me
how
did
that
wicked
man
barlow
i
think
you
called
him
get
into
this
house
the
tall
man
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
as
if
in
doubt
what
he
should
say
and
then
his
expression
of
mingled
hopelessness
and
contrition
changed
into
one
of
earnest
frankness
i
will
tell
you
sir
exactly
he
said
i
have
no
wish
to
conceal
anything
i
have
long
wanted
to
have
an
opportunity
to
inform
occupants
of
houses
especially
those
in
the
suburbs
of
the
insufficiency
of
their
window
fastenings
familiar
with
mechanic
devices
as
i
am
and
accustomed
to
think
of
such
things
the
precautions
of
householders
sometimes
move
me
to
laughter
your
outer
doors
front
and
back
are
of
heavy
wood
chained
locked
and
bolted
often
double
locked
and
bolted
but
your
lower
windows
are
closed
in
the
first
place
by
the
lightest
kind
of
shutters
which
are
very
seldom
fastened
at
all
and
in
the
second
place
by
a
little
contrivance
connecting
the
two
sashes
which
is
held
in
place
by
a
couple
of
baby
screws
if
these
contrivances
are
of
the
best
kind
and
can
not
be
opened
from
the
outside
with
a
or
piece
of
tin
the
burglar
puts
a
chisel
or
jimmy
under
the
lower
sash
and
gently
presses
it
upward
when
the
baby
screws
come
out
as
easily
as
if
they
were
babies
not
for
a
moment
does
the
burglar
trouble
himself
about
the
front
door
with
its
locks
and
chains
and
bolts
he
goes
to
the
window
with
its
baby
screws
which
might
as
well
be
left
open
as
shut
for
all
the
hindrance
it
is
to
his
entrance
and
if
he
meddled
with
the
door
at
all
it
is
simply
to
open
it
from
the
inside
so
that
when
he
is
ready
to
depart
he
may
do
so
easily
but
all
that
does
not
apply
to
my
windows
i
said
they
are
not
fastened
that
way
no
sir
said
the
man
your
lower
shutters
are
solid
and
strong
as
your
doors
this
is
right
for
if
shutters
are
intended
to
obstruct
entrance
to
a
house
they
should
be
as
strong
as
the
doors
when
james
barlow
first
reached
this
house
he
tried
his
jimmy
on
one
of
the
shutters
in
this
main
building
but
he
could
not
open
it
the
heavy
bolt
inside
was
too
strong
for
him
then
he
tried
another
near
by
with
the
same
result
you
will
find
the
shutters
splintered
at
the
bottom
then
he
walked
to
the
small
addition
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
the
kitchen
is
located
here
the
shutters
were
smaller
and
of
course
the
inside
bolts
were
smaller
everything
in
harmony
builders
are
so
careful
to
have
everything
in
harmony
when
barlow
tried
his
jimmy
on
one
of
these
shutters
the
bolt
resisted
for
a
time
but
its
harmonious
proportions
caused
it
to
bend
and
it
was
soon
drawn
from
its
staples
and
the
shutter
opened
and
of
course
the
sash
was
opened
as
i
told
you
sashes
are
opened
well
said
i
shutters
and
sashes
of
mine
shall
never
be
opened
in
that
way
again
it
was
with
that
object
that
i
spoke
to
you
said
the
tall
man
i
wish
you
to
understand
the
faults
of
your
fastenings
and
any
information
i
can
give
you
which
will
better
enable
you
to
protect
your
house
i
shall
be
glad
to
give
as
a
slight
repayment
for
the
injury
i
may
have
helped
to
do
to
you
in
the
way
of
broken
glass
and
spoiled
carpet
i
have
made
window
fastenings
an
especial
study
and
if
you
employ
me
for
the
purpose
i
guarantee
that
i
will
put
your
house
into
a
condition
which
will
be
absolutely
burglar
proof
if
i
do
not
do
this
to
your
satisfaction
i
will
not
ask
to
be
paid
a
cent
we
will
not
consider
that
proposition
now
i
said
for
you
may
have
other
engagements
which
would
interfere
with
the
proposed
job
i
was
about
to
say
that
i
thought
we
had
enough
of
this
sort
of
story
when
aunt
martha
interrupted
me
it
seems
to
me
she
said
speaking
to
the
tall
burglar
that
you
have
instincts
and
perhaps
convictions
of
what
is
right
and
proper
but
it
is
plain
that
you
allow
yourself
to
be
led
and
influenced
by
unprincipled
companions
you
should
avoid
even
the
outskirts
of
evil
you
may
not
know
that
the
proposed
enterprise
is
a
bad
one
but
you
should
not
take
part
in
it
unless
you
know
that
it
is
a
good
one
in
such
cases
you
should
be
rigid
the
man
turned
toward
my
aunt
and
looked
steadfastly
at
her
and
as
he
gazed
his
face
grew
sadder
and
sadder
rigid
he
repeated
that
is
hard
yes
i
remarked
that
is
one
of
the
meanings
of
the
word
paying
no
attention
to
me
he
continued
madam
said
he
with
a
deep
pathos
in
his
voice
no
one
can
be
better
aware
than
i
am
that
i
have
made
many
mistakes
in
the
course
of
my
life
but
that
quality
on
which
i
think
i
have
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
myself
is
my
rigidity
when
i
know
a
thing
is
wrong
there
occurs
to
me
now
an
instance
in
my
career
which
will
prove
to
you
what
i
say
i
knew
a
man
by
the
name
of
spotkirk
who
had
invented
a
liniment
for
the
cure
of
boils
he
made
a
great
success
with
his
liniment
which
he
called
boilene
and
at
the
time
i
speak
of
he
was
a
very
rich
man
one
day
spotkirk
came
to
me
and
told
me
he
wanted
me
to
do
a
piece
of
business
for
him
for
which
he
would
pay
me
dollars
i
was
glad
to
hear
this
for
i
was
greatly
in
need
of
money
and
i
asked
him
what
it
was
he
wanted
me
to
do
know
timothy
barker
said
he
timothy
and
i
have
had
a
misunderstanding
and
i
want
you
to
be
a
referee
or
umpire
between
us
to
set
things
straight
good
said
i
what
is
the
point
of
difference
put
the
whole
thing
before
you
said
he
of
course
you
must
understand
it
or
you
ca
talk
properly
to
timothy
now
you
see
in
the
manufacture
of
my
boilene
i
need
a
great
quantity
of
good
yellow
gravel
and
timothy
barker
has
got
a
gravel
pit
of
that
kind
two
years
ago
i
agreed
with
timothy
that
he
should
furnish
me
with
all
the
gravel
i
should
want
for
of
one
per
cent
of
the
profits
on
the
boilene
we
did
sign
no
papers
for
which
i
am
sorry
but
that
was
the
agreement
and
now
timothy
says
that
of
one
per
cent
is
enough
he
has
gone
wild
about
it
and
actually
wants
ten
per
and
threatens
to
sue
me
if
i
do
give
it
to
him
you
obliged
to
have
gravel
would
something
else
do
for
your
purpose
nothing
as
cheap
said
spotkirk
see
i
have
to
have
lots
and
lots
of
it
every
day
i
fill
a
great
tank
with
the
gravel
and
let
water
onto
it
this
soaks
through
the
gravel
and
comes
out
a
little
pipe
in
the
bottom
of
the
tank
of
a
beautiful
yellow
color
sometimes
it
is
too
dark
and
then
i
have
to
thin
it
with
more
water
you
bottle
it
i
said
said
spotkirk
there
is
all
the
expense
and
labour
of
bottling
it
you
put
nothing
more
into
it
said
i
more
goes
into
it
before
it
corked
said
spotkirk
my
business
that
my
secret
and
nobody
been
able
to
find
it
out
people
have
had
boilene
analyzed
by
chemists
but
they
ca
find
out
the
hidden
secret
of
its
virtue
there
one
thing
that
everybody
who
has
used
it
does
know
and
that
is
that
it
is
a
sure
cure
for
boils
if
applied
for
two
or
three
days
according
to
directions
and
at
the
proper
stage
the
boil
is
sure
to
disappear
as
a
proof
of
its
merit
i
have
sold
seven
hundred
and
thousand
bottles
this
year
a
dollar
a
bottle
said
i
is
the
retail
price
said
he
then
spotkirk
said
i
will
not
be
easy
to
convince
timothy
barker
that
of
one
per
cent
is
enough
for
him
i
suppose
he
hauls
his
gravel
to
your
factory
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
he
is
only
ten
cents
a
load
anywhere
and
if
i
choose
i
could
put
my
factory
right
in
the
middle
of
a
gravel
pit
timothy
barker
has
nothing
to
complain
of
he
knows
you
are
making
a
lot
of
money
said
i
it
will
be
a
hard
job
to
talk
him
over
spotkirk
it
worth
every
cent
of
fifty
dollars
look
here
said
he
you
get
barker
to
sign
a
paper
that
will
suit
me
i
give
you
fifty
dollars
i
rather
do
that
than
have
him
bring
a
suit
if
the
matter
comes
up
in
the
courts
those
rascally
lawyers
will
be
trying
to
find
out
what
i
put
into
my
boilene
and
that
sort
of
thing
would
be
sure
to
hurt
my
business
it
wo
be
so
hard
to
get
a
hold
on
barker
if
you
go
to
work
the
right
way
you
can
just
let
him
understand
that
you
know
all
about
that
robbery
at
where
he
kept
the
stolen
goods
in
his
barn
covered
up
with
hay
for
nearly
a
week
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
timothy
barker
to
understand
that
somebody
else
beside
me
knows
about
that
business
and
if
you
bring
it
in
right
it
will
fetch
him
around
sure
i
kept
quiet
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
i
said
spotkirk
this
is
an
important
business
i
ca
touch
it
under
a
hundred
dollars
he
looked
hard
at
me
and
then
he
said
it
right
and
a
hundred
dollars
is
yours
after
that
i
went
to
see
timothy
barker
and
had
a
talk
with
him
timothy
was
boiling
over
and
considered
himself
the
man
in
the
world
he
had
only
lately
found
out
how
spotkirk
made
his
boilene
and
what
a
big
sale
he
had
for
it
and
he
was
determined
to
have
more
of
the
profits
look
at
it
he
shouted
spotkirk
has
washed
out
my
gravel
it
worth
more
than
it
was
before
and
he
sells
it
for
cents
a
load
to
put
on
gentlemen
places
even
out
of
that
he
makes
a
hundred
and
fifty
per
cent
profit
i
talked
a
good
deal
more
with
timothy
barker
and
found
out
a
good
many
things
about
spotkirk
dealings
with
him
and
then
in
an
manner
i
mentioned
the
matter
of
the
stolen
goods
in
his
barn
just
as
if
i
had
known
all
about
it
from
the
very
first
at
this
timothy
stopped
shouting
and
became
as
meek
as
a
mouse
he
said
nobody
was
as
sorry
as
he
was
when
he
found
the
goods
concealed
in
his
barn
had
been
stolen
and
that
if
he
had
known
it
before
the
thieves
took
them
away
he
should
have
informed
the
authorities
and
then
he
went
on
to
tell
me
how
he
got
so
poor
and
so
hard
up
by
giving
his
whole
time
to
digging
and
hauling
gravel
for
spotkirk
and
neglecting
his
little
farm
that
he
did
not
know
what
was
going
to
become
of
him
and
his
family
if
he
could
make
better
terms
with
spotkirk
for
the
future
and
he
asked
me
very
earnestly
to
help
him
in
this
business
if
i
could
now
then
i
set
myself
to
work
to
consider
this
business
here
was
a
rich
man
oppressing
a
poor
one
and
here
was
this
rich
man
offering
me
one
hundred
dollars
which
in
my
eyes
was
a
regular
fortune
to
help
him
get
things
so
fixed
that
he
could
keep
on
oppressing
the
poor
one
now
then
here
was
a
chance
for
me
to
show
my
principles
here
was
a
chance
for
me
to
show
myself
what
you
madam
call
rigid
and
rigid
i
was
i
just
set
that
dazzling
one
hundred
dollars
aside
much
as
i
wanted
it
much
as
i
actually
needed
it
i
would
look
at
it
or
think
of
it
i
just
said
to
myself
you
can
do
any
good
in
this
matter
do
it
for
the
poor
man
and
i
did
do
it
for
timothy
barker
with
his
poor
wife
and
seven
children
only
two
of
them
old
enough
to
help
him
in
the
gravel
pit
i
went
to
spotkirk
and
i
talked
to
him
and
i
let
him
see
that
if
timothy
barker
showed
up
the
boilene
business
as
he
threatened
to
do
it
would
be
a
bad
day
for
the
spotkirk
family
he
tried
hard
to
talk
me
over
to
his
side
but
i
was
rigid
madam
i
was
rigid
and
the
business
ended
in
my
getting
seven
per
cent
of
the
profits
of
boilene
for
that
poor
man
timothy
barker
and
his
large
family
and
their
domestic
prosperity
is
entirely
due
i
say
it
without
hesitation
to
my
efforts
on
their
behalf
and
to
my
rigidity
in
standing
up
for
the
poor
against
the
rich
of
course
i
here
remarked
you
do
care
to
mention
anything
about
the
money
you
squeezed
out
of
timothy
barker
by
means
of
your
knowledge
that
he
had
been
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
and
i
suppose
the
boilene
man
gave
you
something
to
get
the
percentage
brought
down
from
ten
per
cent
to
seven
the
tall
burglar
turned
and
looked
at
me
with
an
air
of
saddened
resignation
of
course
said
he
it
is
of
no
use
for
a
man
in
my
position
to
endeavour
to
set
himself
right
in
the
eyes
of
one
who
is
prejudiced
against
him
my
hope
is
that
those
present
who
are
not
prejudiced
will
give
my
statements
the
consideration
they
deserve
which
they
certainly
will
do
i
continued
turning
to
my
wife
and
aunt
martha
as
you
have
heard
this
fine
story
i
think
it
is
time
for
you
to
retire
i
do
not
wish
to
retire
promptly
returned
aunt
martha
i
was
never
more
awake
in
my
life
and
could
go
asleep
if
i
tried
what
we
have
heard
may
or
may
not
be
true
but
it
furnishes
subjects
for
reflection
serious
reflection
i
wish
very
much
to
hear
what
that
man
in
the
middle
of
the
bench
has
to
say
for
himself
i
am
sure
he
has
a
story
yes
said
the
stout
man
with
animation
i
got
one
and
like
nothin
better
than
to
tell
it
to
you
if
you
give
me
a
little
somethin
to
wet
my
lips
with
a
little
beer
or
whiskey
and
water
or
anything
you
have
convenient
whiskey
and
water
said
aunt
martha
with
severity
i
should
think
not
it
seems
to
me
you
have
had
all
the
intoxicating
liquors
in
this
house
that
you
would
want
but
i
do
think
you
the
kind
of
person
who
doctor
the
liquor
this
is
the
first
gentleman
house
where
i
ever
found
anything
of
that
kind
the
worse
for
the
gentleman
i
remarked
the
man
grunted
well
he
said
call
it
anything
you
please
milk
cider
or
if
you
have
nothin
else
i
take
water
i
ca
talk
without
somethin
soaky
my
wife
rose
if
we
are
to
listen
to
another
story
she
said
i
want
something
to
keep
up
my
strength
i
shall
go
into
the
and
make
some
tea
and
aunt
martha
can
give
these
men
some
of
that
if
she
likes
the
ladies
now
left
the
room
followed
by
alice
presently
they
called
me
and
leaving
the
burglars
in
charge
of
the
vigilant
david
i
went
to
them
i
found
them
making
tea
i
have
been
upstairs
to
see
if
george
william
is
all
right
and
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
you
think
of
that
man
story
said
my
wife
i
do
think
it
a
story
at
all
said
i
i
call
it
a
lie
a
story
is
a
relation
which
purports
to
be
fiction
no
matter
how
much
like
truth
it
may
be
and
is
intended
to
be
received
as
fiction
a
lie
is
a
false
statement
made
with
the
intention
to
deceive
and
that
is
what
i
believe
we
have
heard
i
agree
with
you
exactly
said
my
wife
it
may
be
said
aunt
martha
that
the
man
story
is
true
there
are
some
things
about
it
which
make
me
think
so
but
if
he
is
really
a
criminal
he
must
have
had
trials
and
temptations
which
led
him
into
his
present
mode
of
life
we
should
consider
that
i
have
been
studying
him
i
said
and
i
think
he
is
a
born
rascal
who
ought
to
have
been
hung
long
ago
my
aunt
looked
at
me
john
she
said
if
you
believe
people
are
born
criminals
they
ought
to
be
executed
in
their
infancy
it
could
be
done
painlessly
by
electricity
and
society
would
be
the
gainer
although
you
lawyers
would
be
the
losers
but
i
do
not
believe
in
your
doctrine
if
the
children
of
the
poor
were
properly
brought
up
and
educated
fewer
of
them
would
grow
to
be
criminals
i
do
think
this
man
suffered
for
want
of
education
said
my
wife
he
used
very
good
language
that
was
one
of
the
first
things
that
led
me
to
suspect
him
it
is
not
likely
that
sons
of
speak
so
correctly
and
express
themselves
so
well
of
course
i
can
not
alter
your
opinions
said
aunt
martha
but
the
story
interested
me
and
i
very
much
wish
to
hear
what
that
other
man
has
to
say
for
himself
very
well
said
i
you
shall
hear
it
but
i
must
drink
my
tea
and
go
back
to
the
prisoners
and
i
said
aunt
martha
will
take
some
tea
to
them
they
may
be
bad
men
but
they
must
not
suffer
i
had
been
in
the
library
but
a
few
moments
when
aunt
martha
entered
followed
by
alice
who
bore
a
tray
containing
three
very
large
cups
of
tea
and
some
biscuit
now
then
said
aunt
martha
to
me
if
you
will
untie
their
hands
i
will
give
them
some
tea
at
these
words
each
burglar
turned
his
eyes
on
me
with
a
quick
glance
i
laughed
hardly
said
i
i
would
not
be
willing
to
undertake
the
task
of
tying
them
up
again
unless
indeed
they
will
consent
to
drink
some
more
of
my
wine
which
we
wo
do
said
the
middle
burglar
and
that
flat
then
they
must
drink
this
tea
with
their
hands
tied
said
aunt
martha
in
a
tone
of
reproachful
resignation
and
taking
a
cup
from
the
tray
she
approached
the
stout
man
and
held
it
up
to
his
lips
at
this
act
of
extreme
kindness
we
were
all
amused
even
the
burglar
companions
smiled
and
david
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
burst
into
a
laugh
which
however
he
quickly
checked
the
stout
burglar
however
saw
nothing
to
laugh
at
he
drank
the
tea
and
never
drew
breath
until
the
cup
was
emptied
i
forgot
said
my
aunt
as
she
removed
the
cup
from
his
lips
to
ask
you
whether
you
took
much
or
little
sugar
do
make
no
difference
to
me
answered
the
man
tea
is
malt
liquor
it
poor
stuff
any
way
and
it
does
matter
to
me
whether
it
got
sugar
in
it
or
not
but
it
moistenin
and
that
what
i
want
now
madam
i
just
say
to
you
if
ever
i
break
into
a
room
where
you
sleepin
i
see
that
you
do
come
to
no
harm
even
if
you
sit
up
in
bed
and
holler
thank
you
said
aunt
martha
but
i
hope
you
will
never
again
be
concerned
in
that
sort
of
business
he
grinned
that
depends
on
circumstances
said
he
aunt
martha
now
offered
the
tall
man
some
tea
but
he
thanked
her
very
respectfully
and
declined
the
young
man
also
said
that
he
did
not
care
for
tea
but
that
if
the
maid
looking
at
alice
would
give
him
a
glass
of
water
he
would
be
obliged
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
spoken
his
voice
was
low
and
of
a
pleasing
tone
david
face
grew
dark
and
we
could
see
that
he
objected
to
this
service
from
alice
i
will
give
him
the
water
myself
said
aunt
martha
this
she
did
and
i
noticed
that
the
man
thirst
was
very
soon
satisfied
when
david
had
been
refreshed
and
biscuits
refused
by
the
burglars
who
could
not
very
well
eat
them
with
their
hands
tied
we
all
sat
down
and
the
stout
man
began
his
story
i
give
it
as
he
told
it
omitting
some
coarse
and
rough
expressions
and
a
good
deal
of
slang
which
would
be
unintelligible
to
the
general
reader
there
no
use
said
the
burglar
for
me
to
try
and
make
any
of
you
believe
that
i
a
pious
gentleman
under
a
cloud
for
i
know
i
look
like
it
and
would
be
likely
to
make
out
a
case
at
this
the
tall
man
looked
at
him
very
severely
i
do
mean
to
say
he
continued
that
my
friend
here
tried
anything
like
that
every
word
he
said
was
perfectly
true
as
i
could
personally
testify
if
i
was
called
upon
the
stand
and
what
i
goin
to
tell
you
is
likewise
solid
fact
my
father
was
a
cracksman
and
a
one
too
he
brought
me
up
to
the
business
beginning
when
i
was
very
small
i
do
remember
havin
any
mother
so
i
leave
her
out
my
old
man
was
very
particular
he
liked
to
see
things
done
right
one
day
i
was
with
him
and
we
saw
a
tinner
nailing
a
new
leader
or
tin
to
the
side
of
a
house
here
young
man
says
dad
makin
a
pretty
poor
job
of
that
you
do
put
in
enough
nails
and
they
ai
half
drove
in
supposin
there
was
a
fire
in
that
house
some
night
and
the
family
had
to
come
down
by
the
spout
and
your
nails
would
give
way
and
break
their
necks
what
would
you
think
then
and
i
can
tell
you
what
it
is
young
man
i
can
appear
you
for
doing
poor
work
the
tinner
grumbled
but
he
used
more
nails
and
drove
tight
dad
and
me
standin
by
an
looking
at
him
one
rainy
night
not
long
after
this
dad
took
me
out
with
him
and
we
stopped
in
front
of
this
house
bobbie
said
he
want
you
to
climb
into
that
open
window
and
then
slip
down
stairs
and
open
the
front
door
for
me
the
family
at
dinner
am
i
to
get
up
dad
said
i
you
can
go
up
the
spout
says
he
warrant
that
it
will
hold
you
i
seen
to
it
that
it
was
put
on
good
and
strong
i
tried
it
and
as
far
as
i
can
remember
i
never
went
up
a
safer
spout
and
you
opened
the
front
door
asked
aunt
martha
indeed
i
did
said
the
burglar
you
would
catch
me
no
mistakes
in
that
line
after
a
while
i
got
too
heavy
to
climb
spouts
and
i
took
to
the
regular
business
and
did
well
at
it
too
do
you
mean
to
say
asked
aunt
martha
that
you
willingly
and
premeditatedly
became
a
thief
and
midnight
robber
that
what
i
am
said
he
i
do
make
no
bones
about
it
a
number
one
burglar
with
all
the
attachments
and
noiseless
treadle
that
what
i
am
and
no
mistake
there
all
kinds
of
businesses
in
this
world
and
there
got
to
be
people
to
work
at
every
one
of
and
when
a
fellow
takes
any
particular
line
his
business
is
to
do
it
well
that
my
motto
when
i
break
into
a
house
i
make
it
a
point
to
clean
it
out
and
not
to
carry
away
no
trash
nuther
of
course
i
had
my
ups
and
my
downs
like
other
people
preachers
and
doctors
and
storekeepers
they
all
have
them
and
i
guess
the
downs
are
more
amusin
than
the
ups
at
least
to
outsiders
i
just
happened
to
think
of
one
of
them
and
let
you
have
it
there
was
a
man
i
knew
named
jerry
hammond
that
was
a
contractor
and
sometimes
he
had
pretty
big
jobs
on
hand
buildin
or
or
somethin
or
other
he
contract
to
do
anything
would
jerry
no
matter
whether
he
ever
done
it
before
or
not
i
got
to
know
his
times
and
seasons
for
collecting
money
and
i
laid
for
him
abominable
meanness
exclaimed
my
wife
it
all
business
said
the
stout
man
quite
unabashed
you
catch
a
doctor
refusin
to
practise
on
a
friend
or
a
lawyer
nuther
and
in
our
line
of
business
it
the
same
thing
it
was
about
the
end
of
october
nigh
four
years
ago
that
i
found
out
that
jerry
had
a
lot
of
money
on
hand
he
been
collectin
it
from
different
parties
and
had
got
home
too
late
in
the
day
to
put
it
in
the
bank
so
says
i
to
myself
this
is
your
time
old
fellow
and
you
better
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
i
was
a
little
afraid
to
crack
jerry
house
by
myself
for
a
strong
old
fellow
so
i
got
a
man
named
putty
henderson
to
go
along
with
me
putty
was
a
big
fellow
and
very
handy
with
a
jimmy
but
he
was
awful
and
he
would
agree
to
clean
out
jerry
until
i
promised
to
go
halves
with
him
this
was
fair
for
it
was
his
job
and
a
quarter
would
have
been
lots
for
him
but
there
was
no
use
arguin
and
along
we
went
and
about
one
we
was
standin
alongside
jerry
bed
where
he
was
fast
asleep
he
was
a
bachelor
and
lived
pretty
much
by
himself
i
give
him
a
punch
to
waken
him
up
for
we
made
up
our
minds
that
that
was
the
way
to
work
this
job
it
would
pay
us
to
go
around
huntin
for
money
he
was
such
a
sharp
old
fellow
it
was
six
to
four
we
never
find
it
he
sat
up
in
bed
with
a
jump
like
a
and
looked
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
of
us
we
both
had
masks
on
and
it
puzzlin
to
guess
what
we
was
there
fur
hammond
says
i
speakin
rather
rough
and
husky
knows
that
you
got
a
lot
o
money
in
this
house
and
we
come
fur
it
we
mean
business
and
there
no
use
foolin
you
can
give
it
to
us
quiet
and
easy
and
keep
a
whole
head
on
your
shoulders
or
we
lay
you
out
ready
fur
a
wake
and
help
ourselves
to
the
funds
and
now
you
pays
your
money
and
you
can
take
your
choice
how
you
do
it
there
shabby
about
us
but
we
mean
business
do
we
pard
so
says
putty
here
says
jerry
jest
as
cool
as
if
he
had
been
sittin
outside
on
his
own
curbstone
know
you
two
men
and
no
mistake
you
tommy
randall
and
you
putty
henderson
so
you
might
as
well
take
off
them
masks
i
am
glad
to
do
says
i
i
hate
and
i
put
mine
in
my
pocket
and
putty
he
took
off
his
excuse
me
said
aunt
martha
interrupting
at
this
point
but
when
hammond
mentioned
the
name
of
tommy
randall
to
whom
did
he
refer
i
can
explain
that
madam
said
the
tall
burglar
quickly
this
man
by
his
criminal
course
of
life
has
got
himself
into
a
good
many
scrapes
and
is
frequently
obliged
to
change
his
name
since
i
accidentally
became
acquainted
with
him
he
has
had
several
aliases
and
i
think
that
he
very
often
forgets
that
his
real
name
is
james
barlow
that
so
said
the
stout
man
there
never
was
a
more
correct
person
than
this
industrious
and
unfortunate
man
sittin
by
me
i
am
dreadful
forgetful
and
sometimes
i
disremember
what
belongs
to
me
and
what
do
names
the
same
as
other
things
now
jerry
says
i
need
think
you
goin
to
make
anythin
by
knowin
us
you
got
to
fork
over
your
cash
all
the
same
and
if
you
think
to
make
anything
by
peachin
on
us
after
we
cleared
out
and
left
you
peaceful
in
your
bed
you
mistook
so
far
as
concerned
for
i
made
the
track
clear
to
get
out
of
this
town
before
daybreak
and
i
do
know
when
i
come
back
this
place
is
gettin
a
little
too
hot
for
me
and
you
my
concludin
exercise
jerry
he
sat
still
for
a
minute
considerin
he
was
no
fool
and
he
knowed
that
there
was
no
use
gettin
scared
nor
cussin
nor
hollerin
more
he
knowed
that
we
was
there
to
get
his
money
and
if
he
fork
it
over
he
get
himself
laid
out
and
that
was
worse
than
money
any
day
boys
says
he
tell
you
what
i
do
make
you
an
offer
a
fair
and
square
offer
what
money
i
got
divide
even
with
you
each
of
us
takin
a
third
and
i
try
to
make
up
what
i
lose
out
of
my
next
contract
now
nothin
could
be
no
squarer
than
that
much
money
have
you
got
jerry
says
i
the
first
thing
to
know
got
hundred
dollars
even
says
he
that
will
be
one
thousand
and
dollars
and
cents
apiece
i
got
bills
to
pay
for
lumber
and
bricks
and
my
third
will
pay
if
i
do
i
go
to
pieces
you
do
want
to
see
me
break
up
business
do
you
jerry
says
i
wo
do
you
have
got
enough
to
divide
into
three
parts
putty
and
me
agree
to
go
halves
with
what
we
get
out
of
you
and
when
i
lay
out
a
piece
of
business
i
do
make
no
changes
half
of
that
money
is
for
me
and
half
is
for
putty
so
just
hand
it
out
and
do
let
have
no
more
jabberin
jerry
he
looked
at
me
pretty
hard
and
then
says
he
about
the
and
meanest
man
i
ever
met
with
here
i
offer
you
a
third
part
of
my
money
and
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
take
it
and
go
away
peaceable
i
be
willin
to

he

a
little
sore
with

arguments
we
had
about

and
he
was
mighty
glad
besides
to
get
the
chance
of
makin
fifty
dollars
extry
and
so
he
said
it
was
all
right
and
he
agree
then
i
thought
it
was
about
time
for
me
to
take
in
some
of
my
sail
and
says
i
that
a
pretty
good
joke
and
you
can
take
my
hat
as
soon
as
i
get
a
new
one
but
of
course
i
do
mean
to
be
hard
on
you
and
if
you
really
have
bills
to
pay
i
take
a
third
and
putty
take
another
and
we
go
away
peaceful
you
wo
sings
out
jerry
and
with
that
he
jumps
out
of
bed
right
at
me
and
putty
henderson
he
comes
at
me
from
the
other
side
and
between
the
two
they
gave
me
the
worst
lickin
i
ever
got
in
my
born
days
and
then
they
dragged
me
down
stairs
and
kicked
me
out
the
front
door
and
i
had
hardly
time
to
pick
myself
up
before
i
saw
a
policeman
about
a
block
off
and
if
he
had
been
a
fat
one
he
had
me
sure
it
would
have
been
pleasant
for
i
was
a
good
deal
wanted
about
that
time
so
you
see
ladies
and
gents
that
it
true
what
i
said
things
always
go
right
in
our
line
of
business
no
more
than
any
other
one
i
think
you
were
served
exactly
right
said
aunt
martha
and
i
wonder
such
an
experience
did
not
induce
you
to
reform
it
did
it
did
said
the
burglar
i
made
a
vow
that
night
that
if
ever
again
i
had
to
call
in
any
one
to
help
me
in
business
of
that
kind
i
would
go
pards
with
him
i
pay
him
so
much
for
the
job
and
i
take
the
risks
and
i
stuck
to
it
but
even
that
do
always
work
luck
sometimes
goes
a
man
even
when
he
working
by
himself
i
remember
a
thing
of
that
kind
that
was
beastly
hard
on
me
a
gentleman
employed
me
to
steal
his
daughter
what
exclaimed
my
wife
and
aunt
martha
steal
his
own
daughter
what
do
you
mean
by
that
that
what
it
was
said
the
stout
burglar
no
more
nor
less
i
was
recommended
to
the
gent
as
a
reliable
party
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
met
him
to
talk
it
over
and
then
he
told
me
just
how
the
case
stood
he
and
his
wife
were
separated
and
the
daughter
about
eleven
years
old
had
been
given
to
her
by
the
court
and
she
put
it
into
a
school
and
the
gent
he
was
goin
to
europe
and
he
wanted
to
get
the
little
gal
and
take
her
with
him
he
tried
to
get
her
once
but
it
slipped
up
and
so
there
was
no
good
in
his
showin
hisself
at
the
school
any
more
which
was
in
the
country
and
he
knowed
that
if
he
expected
to
get
the
gal
he
have
to
hire
a
professional
to
attend
to
it
now
when
i
heard
what
he
had
to
say
i
put
on
the
strictly
pious
and
says
i
a
pretty
bad
thing
you
askin
me
to
do
sir
to
carry
away
a
little
gal
from
its
lovin
mother
and
more
that
to
take
it
from
a
school
where
it
gettin
all
the
benefits
of
eddication
says
he
all
stuff
what
eddication
the
gal
gets
at
a
school
like
that
is
worth
a
row
of
pins
and
when
they
go
away
they
do
know
nothin
useful
nor
even
anything
ornamental
all
they
learned
is
the
pianer
and
higher
mathematics
as
for
anythin
useful
they
nowhere
there
is
one
of
them
could
bound
new
jersey
or
tell
you
when
washington
crossed
the
delaware
may
be
sir
says
i
them
higher
branches
comes
useful
if
washington
really
did
cross
the
delaware
your
little
gal
could
ask
somebody
when
it
was
but
she
could
ask
how
the
pianer
was
played
nor
what
the
whole
multiplication
table
came
to
added
up
them
things
she
have
to
learn
how
to
do
for
herself
i
give
you
my
word
sir
i
could
take
a
little
gal
from
a
school
where
she
was
gettin
a
number
one
eddication
silver
forks
and
towels
extry
the
gent
looked
pretty
glum
for
he
was
to
sail
the
next
day
and
if
i
did
do
the
job
for
him
he
did
know
who
would
and
he
said
that
he
was
sorry
to
see
that
i
was
goin
back
on
him
after
the
recommend
had
and
i
said
that
i
would
go
back
on
him
if
it
was
for
my
conscience
i
was
ready
to
do
any
common
piece
of
business
but
this
stealin
away
little
gals
from
lovin
mothers
was
a
leetle
too
much
for
me
says
he
ai
no
time
to
be
lost
and
how
much
more
will
satisfy
your
conscience
when
i
said
a
hundred
dollars
we
struck
the
bargain
well
we
cut
and
dried
that
business
pretty
straight
i
took
a
cab
and
went
out
to
the
school
and
the
gent
he
got
the
key
of
a
house
that
was
to
let
about
three
miles
from
the
school
and
he
was
to
stay
there
and
look
at
that
empty
house
until
i
brought
him
the
gal
when
he
was
to
pay
me
and
take
her
away
i
like
to
have
had
more
time
so
that
i
could
go
out
and
see
how
the
land
laid
but
there
was
no
more
time
and
i
had
to
do
the
best
i
could
the
gent
told
me
they
all
went
a
walkin
every
afternoon
and
that
if
i
laid
low
that
would
be
the
best
time
to
get
her
and
i
must
just
fetch
her
along
no
matter
who
hollered
i
did
know
exactly
how
i
was
going
to
manage
it
but
i
took
along
with
me
a
big
bag
that
was
made
for
the
conveyance
of
an
extinct
millionaire
but
which
had
never
been
used
owin
to
beforehand
arrangements
which
had
been
made
with
the
party
family
i
left
the
cab
behind
a
bit
of
woods
not
far
from
the
school
and
then
i
laid
low
and
pretty
soon
i
seed
all
coming
out
in
a
double
line
with
the
teacher
behind
for
a
walk
i
had
a
description
of
the
little
gal
as
was
wanted
and
as
they
come
nearer
i
made
her
out
easy
she
was
the
only
real
one
in
the
lot
i
hid
behind
some
bushes
in
the
side
of
the
road
and
when
they
come
up
and
the
little
gal
was
just
opposite
to
me
i
jumped
out
of
the
bushes
and
made
a
dash
at
her
whoop
what
a
row
there
was
in
one
second
such
a
screamin
and
screechin
of
gals
such
a
pilin
on
top
each
other
and
the
teacher
on
top
the
whole
of
bangin
with
her
umbrella
they
pulled
at
the
gal
and
they
pulled
at
me
an
they
yelled
and
they
howled
and
i
never
was
in
such
a
row
and
hope
i
never
shall
be
again
and
i
grabbed
that
girl
by
her
frock
and
i
tumbled
some
over
one
way
and
some
another
and
i
got
the
umbrella
over
my
head
but
i
mind
it
and
i
clapped
that
bag
over
the
little
gal
and
i
jerked
up
her
feet
and
let
her
slip
into
it
and
then
i
took
her
up
like
a
bag
of
meal
and
put
across
the
field
with
the
whole
kit
and
boodle
after
me
but
i
guess
most
of
must
have
tumbled
down
in
hysterics
from
the
screechin
and
i
got
up
to
the
cab
and
away
we
went
well
when
we
got
to
the
house
where
i
was
to
meet
the
gent
he
began
straight
off
to
blow
at
me
do
you
mean
he
yelled
my
daughter
in
a
bag
the
only
way
to
do
it
sir
says
i
holler
and
they
ca
kick
and
people
passin
by
do
know
what
got
and
so
sayin
i
untied
the
strings
put
the
little
gal
on
her
feet
and
pulled
off
the
bag
and
then
i
be
hanged
if
i
ever
saw
a
man
so
ragin
mad
as
he
was
do
i
want
with
that
gal
he
cried
not
my
daughter
that
girl
hair
is
as
black
as
a
coal
and
she
a
jew
besides
as
soon
as
i
sot
my
eyes
on
the
little
varmint
it
come
over
me
that
i
got
the
thing
crooked
and
in
the
scrimmage
i
let
go
of
the
right
gal
and
grabbed
another
i
do
see
how
a
man
could
help
makin
mistakes
with
that
umbrella
whanging
away
at
his
knowledge
box
but
i
was
goin
to
let
on
ai
no
jew
nuther
says
i
your
daughter
too
you
need
try
to
play
no
tricks
on
me
pay
me
my
money
and
take
her
away
as
quick
as
you
can
that
my
advice
or
before
you
know
it
you
be
nabbed
ye
he
yelled
you
think
pay
you
anything
for
that
little
jew
just
as
much
a
christian
as
you
are
says
i
you
a
christian
little
gal
and
this
gentleman
your
father
and
ai
you
surprised
that
he
wants
to
give
you
back
to
be
put
in
the
bag
i
said
this
hopin
she
have
sense
enough
to
say
he
was
her
father
so
to
get
rid
of
me
the
wretched
gal
had
been
clean
dumbfounded
when
she
was
took
out
of
the
bag
and
had
done
nothin
so
far
but
blubber
and
cry
and
try
to
get
away
which
she
could
because
i
held
her
frock
but
now
she
ups
and
screams
he
was
her
father
and
she
never
seen
him
before
and
then
he
storms
and
swears
and
tells
me
to
take
her
back
where
i
got
her
and
i
tell
him
i
see
him
hanged
first
and
what
i
want
is
my
money
she
screams
and
he
swears
he
not
pay
me
a
cent
and
i
squares
off
and
says
that
i
thrash
him
out
of
his
skin
and
then
he
calls
in
his
coachman
and
they
both
make
at
me
and
i
backs
out
the
door
to
get
my
cabby
to
stand
by
me
and
i
found
that
he
cut
out
havin
most
likely
got
frightened
afraid
of
bein
mixed
up
in
trouble
then
i
seed
on
the
high
road
some
half
a
mile
away
some
men
comin
gallopin
and
the
gent
he
looked
out
and
seed
too
and
then
says
he
to
me
jist
take
that
little
jew
gal
back
where
you
got
her
from
no
use
to
me
i
goin
and
at
that
i
hollered
for
my
money
and
made
a
grab
at
him
but
the
coachman
he
tripped
me
over
backward
and
before
i
could
git
up
again
they
was
both
off
with
the
horses
on
a
run
i
was
so
mad
i
could
speak
but
there
was
no
time
for
foolin
and
i
had
made
up
my
mind
which
door
i
should
cut
out
of
when
the
fellows
on
horseback
went
ridin
past
as
hard
as
they
could
go
they
must
have
seed
the
carriage
drivin
away
and
thought
for
sure
it
had
the
gal
in
it
and
they
was
after
it
when
they
was
clean
gone
i
looked
round
for
the
little
gal
but
could
see
her
but
all
she
came
out
of
the
fireplace
where
she
been
hidin
she
got
over
her
cryin
and
over
her
scare
too
judgin
from
her
looks
glad
he
gone
says
she
i
mighty
glad
too
that
haskins
and
them
other
men
did
see
me
they
says
neighbors
says
she
if
they
knew
i
was
here
they
took
me
back
you
little
minx
say
i
that
what
you
want
says
she
did
want
to
go
with
that
man
for
i
do
know
him
and
i
hate
him
but
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
that
school
i
hate
it
worse
than
anything
in
the
whole
world
you
have
no
idea
what
a
horrid
place
it
is
they
just
work
you
to
death
and
give
you
half
enough
to
eat
my
constitution
wo
stand
it
i
told
pop
that
and
he
thinks
so
too
but
marm
she
do
believe
in
it
and
my
stayin
there
is
all
her
doin
i
been
wantin
to
get
away
for
ever
so
long
but
i
did
want
to
be
took
off
in
a
bag
but
now
that
i
out
of
that
horrid
hole
i
do
want
to
go
back
and
if
you
take
me
home
to
pop
i
know
he
wo
let
me
go
back
and
he
pay
you
real
handsome
besides
your
pop
says
groppeltacker
of
groppeltacker
mintz
corset
findings
seven
hundred
and
something
or
other
i
forget
the
number
now
broadway
oh
pop
does
a
lot
of
business
i
tell
you
and
he
got
lots
of
money
he
sends
corset
findings
to
south
america
and
paris
and
chicago
and
madagascar
and
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
i
heard
him
say
that
often
and
you
need
be
afraid
of
his
not
bein
able
to
pay
you
a
lot
more
than
that
man
would
have
paid
you
for
his
little
gal
if
you
catched
the
right
one
so
if
you
take
me
to
pop
and
get
me
there
safe
and
sound
it
will
be
an
awful
good
speck
for
you
now
i
begins
to
think
to
myself
that
perhaps
there
was
somethin
in
what
that
little
jew
gal
was
sayin
and
that
i
might
make
something
out
of
the
gal
after
all
i
did
count
on
gettin
a
big
pile
out
of
old
groppeltacker
it
was
likely
he
was
that
kind
of
a
man
but
whatever
i
did
get
would
be
clean
profit
and
i
might
as
well
try
it
on
he
could
make
no
charge
me
fur
bringin
him
his
daughter
if
she
asked
me
to
do
it
so
says
i
to
her
if
i
take
you
home
to
your
pop
will
you
promise
on
your
word
an
honour
that
you
wo
say
nothin
about
my
carryin
you
off
in
a
bag
and
say
that
you
seed
me
walkin
along
the
road
and
liked
my
looks
and
told
me
you
were
sufferin
and
asked
me
to
take
you
home
to
your
kind
parents
where
you
might
be
took
proper
care
of
and
that
i
said
i
was
goin
that
way
but
i
do
it
out
of
pure
christian
charity
and
nothin
more
nor
less
and
here
you
was
and
then
of
course
you
can
tell
him
he
ought
to
do
the
handsome
thing
by
me
do
that
says
she
i
tell
how
you
talked
to
me
awful
kind
for
more
than
an
hour
tryin
to
keep
me
to
stay
at
the
school
and
it
was
till
i
got
down
on
my
knees
and
weeped
that
you
agreed
to
take
me
to
my
kind
father
right
says
i
might
as
well
take
you
along
but
we
have
to
go
back
by
the
railroad
and
foot
it
at
least
two
miles
to
the
station
and
i
do
know
about
walkin
across
the
country
with
a
little
girl
dressed
as
fine
as
you
are
i
might
get
myself
suspicioned
so
says
she
might
meet
somebody
that
know
me
and
then
she
wriggled
up
her
little
forehead
and
began
to
think
i
never
did
see
such
a
little
gal
as
sharp
as
that
one
was
needles
was
nothin
to
her
in
about
a
minute
she
says
that
bag
of
yourn
it
is
says
i
and
then
she
took
it
and
looked
at
it
up
and
down
with
her
head
cocked
on
one
side
somethin
to
cut
that
bag
with
says
she
could
fix
myself
up
so
that
nobody
know
me
do
care
who
it
was
do
want
that
bag
cut
says
i
an
extry
good
bag
it
was
made
for
a
particular
purpose
and
cost
money
will
pay
expenses
says
she
much
did
it
cost
was
four
dollars
cash
said
cheated
you
like
everything
says
she
could
get
a
bag
like
that
any
day
for
a
dollar
and
cents
will
you
let
it
go
at
that
right
says
i
for
i
was
tickled
to
see
how
sharp
that
little
jew
gal
was
and
ten
to
one
i
throwed
away
the
bag
before
we
got
to
town
so
she
pulled
a
little
book
out
of
her
pocket
with
a
pencil
stuck
in
it
and
turnin
over
to
a
blank
page
she
put
down
one
dollar
and
then
she
borrows
my
big
knife
and
holdin
the
top
of
the
bag
up
her
belt
she
made
me
stick
a
pin
in
it
about
a
from
the
floor
then
she
took
the
knife
and
cut
the
bag
clean
across
me
one
side
of
it
then
she
took
the
top
end
of
that
bag
and
slipped
it
on
her
over
her
head
and
shoulders
and
tied
the
drawin
strings
in
it
round
her
waist
and
it
hung
around
her
just
like
a
skirt
nearly
touchin
the
ground
then
she
split
open
the
rest
of
the
bag
and
made
a
kind
of
shawl
out
of
it
puttin
it
into
shape
with
a
lot
o
pins
and
pinnin
it
on
herself
real
clever
she
had
lots
of
pins
in
her
belt
and
she
told
me
that
she
never
passed
a
pin
in
that
school
without
pickin
it
up
and
that
she
had
four
hundred
and
of
them
now
in
her
room
which
she
was
mighty
sorry
to
leave
behind
and
that
these
she
had
now
was
this
day
pickin
up
when
she
got
done
workin
at
herself
you
could
see
not
a
ribbon
nor
a
hem
of
her
fine
clothes
it
was
all
black
skirt
and
shawl
and
put
up
her
sleeve
so
that
when
her
arm
stuck
out
it
was
bare
then
she
took
all
the
ribbons
and
flowers
off
her
hat
and
crumpled
it
up
and
when
she
tied
it
on
what
a
guy
she
was
says
she
can
go
barefoot
you
wo
says
i
you
get
your
feet
all
cut
but
you
can
muddy
your
shoes
which
she
did
i
pumpin
on
so
that
the
dust
in
the
back
yard
would
stick
then
we
starts
off
across
the
country
and
upon
my
word
i
was
pretty
nigh
ashamed
to
be
seen
walkin
with
such
a
little
scarecrow
when
i
bought
the
tickets
at
the
station
she
asked
me
how
much
they
was
and
put
it
down
in
her
book
when
we
got
into
the
cars
the
people
all
looked
hard
at
her
and
i
reckon
they
thought
some
kind
of
a
home
had
been
burnt
down
and
this
was
one
of
the
orphans
that
had
been
saved
but
they
did
say
nothin
and
she
fixed
herself
as
comfortable
as
you
please
and
before
long
a
boy
came
through
the
car
with
fruit
in
a
basket
and
then
says
she
to
me
want
two
apples
the
boy
had
gone
past
us
but
i
got
up
and
followed
him
and
bought
her
two
apples
much
did
you
give
for
them
says
she
when
i
come
was
two
for
five
cents
says
says
she
do
stick
you
dreadful
two
for
three
cents
is
all
papa
or
i
pays
for
apples
like
them
and
she
took
out
her
little
book
and
put
down
three
cents
well
miss
says
i
if
you
want
any
more
refreshments
you
buy
yourself
think
i
better
says
she
and
she
went
to
work
eatin
them
two
apples
she
had
more
than
got
through
with
when
the
boy
came
around
want
a
banana
says
she
me
five
cents
which
i
did
and
she
put
down
five
cents
then
the
boy
come
up
and
says
she
much
are
your
bananas
cents
said
two
says
says
he
one
do
you
take
me
for
says
she
bought
bananas
before
i
give
you
three
cents
for
that
one
pointin
to
the
biggest
in
the
ca
do
that
said
the
boy
price
is
five
cents
like
a
banana
says
she
i
do
pay
more
three
cents
take
it
or
leave
it
and
with
that
the
boy
went
on
says
i
gouged
yourself
out
of
a
banana
a
bit
of
it
says
she
be
back
and
in
two
minutes
he
was
back
and
said
she
might
have
it
for
three
cents
you
got
two
coppers
said
she
me
see
he
said
he
had
and
showed
to
her
and
she
took
and
the
banana
and
then
give
him
five
cents
and
then
she
did
give
the
change
to
me
but
put
it
in
her
pocket
says
she
you
buy
things
that
way
you
be
rich
in
time
when
we
got
to
the
city
we
took
the
elevated
and
went
up
town
to
street
and
then
walked
over
to
her
father
house
it
was
a
big
one
on
one
of
the
cross
streets
when
we
got
there
she
told
me
to
wait
a
minute
and
lookin
around
to
see
that
nobody
was
comin
she
slipped
off
the
skirt
and
the
cape
she
had
made
and
rolled
up
in
a
bundle
do
matter
about
my
hat
and
shoes
says
she
they
would
know
me
in
such
duds
then
handin
me
the
bundle
she
said
cents
you
can
get
that
bag
mended
just
as
good
as
new
so
you
can
take
it
and
it
will
save
us
a
dollar
and
a
half
you
do
says
i
for
i
had
enough
of
her
stinginess
do
touch
that
bag
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
minute
to
charge
the
old
man
five
dollars
worth
when
the
front
door
was
opened
the
servant
gal
looked
as
if
she
could
believe
her
eyes
but
my
young
woman
was
as
cool
as
you
please
and
she
had
me
showed
into
a
room
off
the
hall
and
then
she
went
i
sat
a
long
time
which
gave
me
a
good
chance
to
look
around
at
things
the
room
was
real
handsome
and
i
took
a
peep
at
the
window
fastenin
and
the
lay
of
the
doors
thinkin
the
knowledge
might
come
in
handy
some
time
right
in
front
of
me
on
a
table
was
a
little
yellow
mouse
and
it
struck
me
as
i
looked
at
it
that
that
must
be
gold
i
listened
if
anybody
was
comin
and
then
i
picked
it
up
to
see
if
it
really
was
i
thought
i
heard
the
ring
just
then
and
shut
it
up
in
my
hand
quick
but
nobody
went
to
the
door
and
then
i
looked
at
the
little
mouse
and
if
it
was
pure
gold
it
was
the
best
imitation
ever
i
see
so
i
slipped
it
quietly
in
my
pocket
to
look
at
it
when
i
had
time
pretty
soon
old
groppeltacker
come
in
shut
the
door
and
sot
down
you
brought
my
daughter
back
says
says
you
expect
to
be
paid
for
it
says
says
i
do
much
do
you
ask
for
your
services
says
he
now
this
was
a
sort
of
a
staggerer
for
i
had
made
up
my
mind
how
much
i
was
goin
to
ask
but
there
was
time
for
no
more
thinkin
about
it
and
so
says
i
plum
hundred
dollars
and
there
was
some
expenses
besides
well
says
he
seems
like
a
good
deal
just
for
bringin
a
little
gal
from
school
it
could
have
took
you
more
a
couple
of
hours
do
charge
for
time
says
i
for
the
risks
and
the
science
of
the
thing
there
mighty
few
men
in
this
town
could
have
brought
your
daughter
home
as
neat
as
i
did
well
says
he
rubbin
his
hands
expect
i
have
to
pay
for
the
whole
term
of
the
school
whether
she
there
or
not
and
the
business
will
come
heavy
on
me
do
you
think
sixty
dollars
would
pay
you
now
i
know
when
you
deal
with
this
sort
of
a
man
there
always
a
good
deal
of
difference
splittin
and
so
says
i
it
wo
i
might
take
ninety
dollars
but
that
the
very
lowest
peg
very
lowest
says
he
gettin
up
and
walkin
about
a
little
and
then
i
thought
i
heard
the
ring
again
and
i
was
dreadful
afraid
somebody
would
come
and
call
off
the
old
man
before
he
finished
the
bargain
says
i
call
it
and
expenses
and
there
i
stop
groppeltacker
now
he
set
down
and
looked
hard
at
me
ask
you
to
bring
my
daughter
back
says
he
speakin
gruff
and
very
different
from
the
way
he
spoke
before
what
more
i
did
want
her
back
and
what
more
yet
i
not
goin
to
pay
you
a
red
cent
look
says
i
mighty
sharp
o
that
old
man
fork
over
the
money
or
i
lay
you
out
stiff
as
a
poker
and
help
myself
i
not
a
fellow
to
be
fooled
with
and
there
nobody
in
this
house
can
stop
me
old
groppeltacker
he
did
turn
a
hair
but
just
sot
there
and
says
he
you
blow
any
more
suppose
you
take
my
little
gold
mouse
out
of
your
pocket
and
hand
it
to
me
i
must
say
i
was
took
back
at
this
but
i
spoke
back
as
bold
as
brass
and
said
i
never
seed
his
gold
mouse
ho
says
he
you
did
see
was
the
electric
button
under
the
table
cover
which
rung
a
bell
when
the
mouse
was
picked
up
that
what
i
call
my
at
this
i
jist
over
says
i
you
hand
out
every
cent
you
got
and
your
watch
too
not
another
word
and
i
jumped
up
and
clapped
my
hand
on
my
pistol
in
my
and
just
at
that
minute
there
was
a
click
and
the
nippers
were
on
me
and
there
was
a
big
policeman
with
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
i
could
speak
i
was
so
and
so
dumbfounded
both
at
once
old
groppeltacker
he
just
leaned
back
and
he
laughed
came
in
he
said
to
the
cop
the
second
i
rang
and
as
soft
as
a
cat
and
the
first
thing
that
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
take
that
gold
mouse
out
of
his
pocket
and
i
be
on
hand
whenever
you
let
me
know
i
wanted
the
cop
he
took
the
gold
mouse
out
of
my
pocket
and
says
he
know
this
fellow
and
if
i
not
mistook
they
be
more
charges
than
yourn
made
him
there
was
no
chance
to
show
fight
so
i
did
do
it
but
i
says
to
old
groppeltacker
my
expenses
you
got
to
pay
them
anyway
right
says
he
you
send
in
your
bill
marked
correct
by
my
daughter
and
i
settle
it
and
he
laughed
again
and
the
cop
he
took
me
off
well
ladies
and
gents
that
little
piece
of
business
together
with
some
other
old
scores
took
me
to
sing
sing
for
three
years
and
it
tai
six
months
since
i
got
out
so
you
can
see
for
yourselves
what
hard
times
a
fellow
in
my
line
of
business
sometimes
has
well
said
aunt
martha
i
do
approve
of
the
groppeltacker
sort
of
people
but
if
there
were
more
of
that
kind
i
believe
there
would
be
fewer
of
your
kind
that
story
shows
you
in
such
a
bad
light
that
i
believe
it
true
every
word
of
it
said
the
man
i
wish
it
was
and
now
i
spoke
since
you
claim
to
be
a
being
i
said
to
the
stout
burglar
suppose
you
tell
me
why
you
never
attempted
before
to
break
into
my
house
every
considerable
dwelling
in
this
neighbourhood
has
been
entered
and
i
have
no
doubt
you
are
the
men
who
committed
all
the
burglaries
no
sir
said
he
not
men
i
am
the
man
who
did
all
but
these
two
friends
of
mine
was
never
with
me
before
in
a
bit
of
business
like
this
in
their
line
i
have
had
pals
with
me
but
they
was
professionals
these
ai
cracksmen
they
do
know
nothin
about
it
but
this
one
is
handy
at
tools
and
that
the
reason
i
brung
him
along
but
you
see
he
kicked
and
was
goin
to
give
me
away
and
this
young
gentleman
never
mind
about
that
young
gentleman
i
said
i
have
a
certain
curiosity
to
know
why
my
house
was
not
entered
when
the
others
were
well
said
he
i
do
mind
tellin
yer
how
that
was
it
was
on
account
of
your
baby
we
do
like
to
crack
a
house
where
there
a
pretty
small
baby
that
liable
to
wake
up
and
howl
any
minute
and
rouse
up
the
rest
of
the
family
there
no
workin
in
a
house
with
comfort
when
there
such
a
young
one
about
i
tell
you
what
it
is
all
your
and
your
dogs
ai
worth
nuthin
alongside
of
a
baby
for
guardin
a
house
if
a
cracksman
ai
careful
the
alarms
will
go
off
and
if
he
do
know
how
to
manage
dogs
the
dogs
will
bark
but
by
george
sir
there
ai
no
providin
a
baby
he
howl
any
time
and
nobody
can
tell
when
so
i
waited
till
your
baby
was
a
little
more
settled
in
its
ways
and
slept
soundly
and
then
we
come
along
and
here
we
are
this
statement
very
much
surprised
me
and
did
not
elate
me
without
saying
so
to
any
one
i
had
flattered
myself
that
the
burglars
had
heard
of
my
precautions
and
of
my
excellent
stock
of
firearms
and
perhaps
had
got
a
notion
that
i
would
be
an
intrepid
man
to
deal
with
and
it
was
somewhat
humiliating
to
find
that
it
was
our
baby
the
burglars
were
afraid
of
and
not
myself
my
wife
was
amazed
can
it
be
possible
she
said
that
these
people
know
so
much
about
our
baby
and
that
george
william
has
been
protecting
this
house
it
makes
my
flesh
creep
said
aunt
martha
do
you
know
everything
about
all
of
us
wish
i
did
said
the
stout
burglar
wish
i
known
about
that
beastly
liquor
well
we
had
enough
of
this
said
i
rising
and
my
dear
you
and
aunt
martha
must
be
ready
to
go
to
bed
and
david
and
i
will
keep
guard
over
these
fellows
until
morning
at
this
instant
the
youngest
burglar
spoke
his
face
wore
a
very
anxious
expression
may
i
ask
sir
he
said
what
you
intend
to
do
with
me
in
the
morning
i
have
already
said
i
answered
that
i
shall
then
hand
over
all
of
you
to
the
officers
of
justice
of
this
country
but
sir
said
the
young
man
you
will
surely
except
me
i
am
not
at
all
concerned
in
this
matter
and
it
would
be
of
the
greatest
possible
injury
to
me
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
or
to
be
mentioned
in
public
reports
as
an
associate
of
a
criminal
i
not
acquainted
with
the
gentleman
at
the
other
end
of
the
bench
but
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
from
what
he
said
to
me
that
he
intended
to
notify
you
if
this
james
barlow
proceeded
to
any
open
act
for
myself
i
beg
you
will
allow
me
to
state
who
and
what
i
am
and
to
tell
you
by
what
a
strange
concatenation
of
circumstances
i
happen
to
find
myself
in
my
present
position
one
which
i
assure
you
causes
me
the
greatest
embarrassment
and
anxiety
we
had
enough
for
one
night
said
i
and
you
had
better
reserve
your
statement
for
the
magistrate
here
aunt
martha
put
in
her
voice
that
is
not
fair
she
said
two
of
them
have
been
allowed
to
speak
and
this
one
has
just
as
much
right
to
be
heard
as
the
others
what
do
you
say
cornelia
i
hoped
that
my
wife
would
put
herself
on
my
side
and
would
say
that
we
had
enough
of
this
sort
of
thing
but
female
curiosity
is
an
unknown
quantity
and
she
unhesitatingly
replied
that
she
would
like
to
hear
the
young
man
story
i
sat
down
in
despair
it
was
useless
to
endeavour
to
withstand
this
yearning
for
personal
information
one
of
the
curses
i
may
say
of
our
present
civilization
the
young
man
gave
no
time
for
change
of
opinion
but
immediately
began
his
voice
was
rich
and
rather
low
and
his
manner
exceedingly
pleasing
and
gentle
i
wish
to
state
in
the
first
place
said
he
that
i
am
a
reporter
for
the
press
in
the
exercise
of
my
vocation
i
have
frequently
found
myself
in
peculiar
and
unpleasant
positions
but
never
before
have
i
been
in
a
situation
so
embarrassing
so
humiliating
as
this
in
the
course
of
my
studies
and
experiences
i
have
found
that
in
literature
and
journalism
as
well
as
in
art
one
can
make
a
true
picture
only
of
what
one
has
seen
imagination
is
all
very
well
often
grand
and
beautiful
but
imaginative
authors
show
us
their
inner
selves
and
not
our
outer
world
there
is
a
demand
for
the
real
and
it
is
a
demand
which
will
be
satisfied
with
nothing
but
the
truth
i
have
determined
as
far
as
in
me
lies
to
endeavour
to
supply
this
demand
and
i
have
devoted
myself
to
the
study
of
realism
with
this
end
in
view
i
have
made
it
a
rule
never
to
describe
anything
i
have
not
personally
seen
and
examined
if
we
would
thoroughly
understand
and
appreciate
our
we
must
know
what
they
do
and
how
they
do
it
otherwise
we
can
not
give
them
credit
for
their
virtues
or
judge
them
properly
for
their
faults
if
i
could
prevent
crime
i
would
annihilate
it
and
when
it
ceased
to
exist
the
necessity
for
describing
it
would
also
cease
but
it
does
exist
it
is
a
powerful
element
in
the
life
of
the
human
race
being
known
and
acknowledged
everywhere
it
should
be
understood
therefore
it
should
be
described
the
grand
reality
of
which
we
are
a
part
can
never
be
truly
comprehended
until
we
comprehend
all
its
parts
but
i
will
not
philosophize
i
have
devoted
myself
to
realism
and
in
order
to
be
a
conscientious
student
i
study
it
in
all
its
branches
i
am
frequently
called
upon
to
write
accounts
of
burglars
and
burglaries
and
in
order
thoroughly
to
understand
these
people
and
their
method
of
action
i
determined
as
soon
as
the
opportunity
should
offer
itself
to
accompany
a
burglarious
expedition
my
sole
object
was
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
of
the
subject
knowledge
which
to
me
would
be
valuable
and
i
may
say
essential
i
engaged
this
man
james
barlow
to
take
me
with
him
the
first
time
he
should
have
on
hand
an
affair
of
this
kind
and
thus
it
is
that
you
find
me
here
in
this
company
as
i
came
here
for
the
purpose
of
earnest
and
thorough
investigation
i
will
frankly
admit
that
i
would
not
have
interfered
with
his
processes
but
at
the
same
time
i
would
have
seen
that
no
material
injuries
should
result
to
any
members
of
this
family
that
was
very
kind
of
you
i
said
at
which
my
wife
looked
at
me
somewhat
reproachingly
if
he
really
intended
it
she
remarked
and
i
do
not
see
why
that
was
not
the
case
it
was
kind
in
him
as
for
me
said
aunt
martha
very
sympathetically
i
think
that
the
study
of
realism
may
be
carried
a
great
deal
too
far
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
the
slightest
necessity
for
people
to
know
anything
about
burglars
if
people
keep
talking
and
reading
about
diseases
they
will
get
them
and
if
they
keep
talking
and
reading
about
crimes
they
will
find
that
iniquity
is
catching
the
same
as
some
other
things
besides
this
realistic
description
gets
to
be
very
tiresome
if
you
really
want
to
be
a
writer
young
man
why
do
you
try
your
hand
on
some
original
composition
then
you
might
write
something
which
would
be
interesting
ah
madam
said
the
young
man
casting
his
eyes
on
the
floor
it
would
be
far
beyond
my
power
to
write
anything
more
wonderful
than
what
i
have
known
and
seen
if
i
may
tell
you
some
of
the
things
which
have
happened
to
me
you
will
understand
why
i
have
become
convinced
that
in
this
world
of
realities
imagination
must
always
take
a
second
place
of
course
we
want
to
hear
your
story
said
aunt
martha
that
is
what
we
are
here
for
if
i
was
unbound
said
the
young
man
looking
at
me
i
could
speak
more
freely
no
doubt
of
it
said
i
but
perhaps
you
might
run
away
before
you
finished
your
story
i
would
have
that
happen
for
the
world
do
make
fun
of
him
said
aunt
martha
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
cut
him
loose
but
after
what
you
say
i
think
it
would
perhaps
be
just
as
well
to
keep
them
all
tied
until
the
narratives
are
completed
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
the
young
man
began
his
story
i
am
american
born
but
my
father
who
was
a
civil
engineer
and
of
high
rank
in
his
profession
was
obliged
when
i
was
quite
a
small
boy
to
go
to
austria
where
he
had
made
extensive
contracts
for
the
building
of
railroads
in
that
country
i
spent
the
greater
part
of
my
boyhood
and
youth
there
i
was
educated
in
the
best
schools
my
father
sparing
no
money
to
have
me
taught
everything
that
a
gentleman
should
know
my
mother
died
when
i
was
a
mere
infant
and
as
my
father
vocation
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
travel
a
great
deal
my
life
was
often
a
lonely
one
for
society
i
depended
entirely
upon
my
my
tutors
and
masters
it
was
my
father
intention
however
that
when
i
had
finished
my
studies
i
should
go
to
one
of
the
great
capitals
there
to
mix
with
the
world
but
when
this
period
arrived
i
was
in
no
haste
to
avail
myself
of
the
advantages
he
offered
me
my
tastes
were
studious
my
disposition
contemplative
and
i
was
a
lover
of
rural
life
my
father
had
leased
an
old
castle
in
carinthia
not
far
from
the
mountains
and
here
he
kept
his
books
and
charts
and
here
he
came
for
recreation
and
study
whenever
his
arduous
duties
gave
him
a
little
for
several
months
i
had
lived
at
this
castle
happy
when
my
father
was
with
me
and
happy
when
i
was
alone
i
expected
soon
to
go
to
vienna
where
my
father
would
introduce
me
to
some
of
his
influential
friends
but
day
by
day
i
postponed
the
journey
walking
one
morning
a
few
miles
from
the
castle
i
saw
at
the
edge
of
a
piece
of
woodland
a
female
figure
seated
beneath
a
tree
approaching
nearer
i
perceived
that
she
was
young
and
that
she
was
sketching
i
was
surprised
for
i
knew
that
in
this
part
of
the
world
young
women
at
least
those
of
the
upper
classes
to
which
the
costume
and
tastes
of
this
one
showed
her
to
belong
were
not
allowed
to
wander
about
the
country
by
themselves
but
although
i
stood
still
and
watched
the
young
lady
for
some
time
no
companion
appeared
upon
the
scene
the
path
i
had
intended
to
take
led
past
the
piece
of
woodland
and
i
saw
no
reason
why
i
should
diverge
from
my
proposed
course
i
accordingly
proceeded
and
when
i
reached
the
young
lady
i
bowed
and
raised
my
hat
i
think
that
for
some
time
she
had
perceived
my
approach
and
she
looked
up
at
me
with
a
face
that
was
half
merry
half
inquisitive
and
perfectly
charming
i
can
not
describe
the
effect
which
her
expression
had
upon
me
i
had
never
seen
her
before
but
her
look
was
not
such
a
one
as
she
would
bestow
upon
a
stranger
i
had
the
most
powerful
desire
to
stop
and
speak
to
her
but
having
no
right
to
do
so
i
should
have
passed
on
had
she
not
said
to
me
in
the
best
of
english
sir
then
i
stopped
you
may
be
sure
i
was
so
accustomed
to
speak
to
those
i
meet
in
either
french
or
german
that
i
involuntarily
said
to
her
jour
need
not
speak
french
she
said
am
neither
english
nor
american
but
i
speak
english
are
you
the
gentleman
who
lives
in
wulrick
castle
if
so
we
are
neighbours
and
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
why
you
live
there
all
the
time
alone
at
this
i
sat
down
by
her
am
that
person
i
said
and
handed
her
my
card
before
i
say
any
more
please
tell
me
who
you
are
am
marie
dorfler
my
father
house
is
on
the
other
side
of
this
piece
of
woodland
you
can
not
see
it
from
here
this
is
part
of
his
estate
and
now
tell
me
why
you
live
all
by
yourself
in
that
old
ruin
is
not
altogether
a
ruin
i
answered
of
it
is
in
very
good
condition
and
then
i
proceeded
to
give
her
an
account
of
my
method
of
life
and
my
reasons
for
it
is
interesting
she
said
it
is
very
odd
do
not
think
it
half
so
odd
i
answered
that
you
should
be
here
by
yourself
is
truly
an
sort
of
thing
she
said
just
now
i
am
doing
things
if
i
do
not
do
them
now
i
shall
never
have
the
opportunity
again
in
two
weeks
i
shall
be
married
and
then
i
shall
go
to
prague
and
everything
will
be
by
line
and
rule
no
more
delightful
rambles
by
myself
no
more
sitting
quietly
in
the
woods
watching
the
little
birds
and
hares
no
more
making
a
sketch
just
where
i
please
no
matter
whether
the
ground
be
damp
or
not
wonder
that
you
are
allowed
to
do
these
things
now
i
am
not
allowed
she
answered
do
them
in
hours
when
i
am
supposed
to
be
painting
flower
pieces
in
an
upper
room
when
you
married
i
said
husband
will
be
your
companion
in
such
rambles
she
said
shrugging
her
shoulders
will
be
on
the
thirteenth
of
next
month
which
i
believe
is
july
and
he
is
a
great
deal
more
grizzled
than
my
father
who
is
past
fifty
he
is
very
particular
about
all
sorts
of
things
as
i
suppose
he
has
to
be
as
he
is
a
colonel
of
infantry
nobody
could
possibly
disapprove
of
my
present
performances
more
than
he
would
i
could
not
help
ejaculating
then
do
you
marry
him
she
smiled
at
my
earnestness
that
is
all
arranged
she
said
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
have
known
for
more
than
a
year
that
i
to
marry
colonel
kaldhein
but
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
given
myself
much
concern
about
it
until
recently
it
now
occurs
to
me
that
if
i
expect
to
amuse
myself
in
the
way
i
best
like
i
must
lose
no
time
doing
so
i
looked
at
the
girl
with
earnest
interest
appears
to
me
said
i
your
ways
of
amusing
yourself
are
very
much
like
mine
is
true
she
said
looking
up
with
animation
are
is
it
not
delightful
to
be
free
to
go
where
you
like
and
do
what
you
please
without
any
one
to
advise
or
interfere
with
you
is
delightful
said
i
and
for
half
an
hour
we
sat
and
talked
about
these
delights
and
kindred
subjects
she
was
much
interested
in
our
castle
and
urged
me
to
make
a
sketch
of
it
so
that
she
may
know
what
it
now
looked
like
she
had
seen
it
when
a
little
girl
but
never
since
and
had
been
afraid
to
wander
very
far
in
this
direction
by
herself
i
told
her
that
it
would
be
far
better
for
her
to
see
the
castle
with
her
own
eyes
and
that
i
could
conduct
her
to
an
eminence
not
half
a
mile
away
where
she
could
have
an
excellent
view
of
it
this
plan
greatly
pleased
her
but
looking
at
her
watch
she
said
that
it
would
be
too
late
for
her
to
go
that
morning
but
if
i
happened
to
come
that
way
the
next
day
and
she
should
be
there
to
finish
her
sketch
she
would
be
delighted
to
have
me
show
her
the
eminence
i
think
interrupted
aunt
martha
that
she
was
a
very
imprudent
young
woman
that
may
be
he
replied
but
you
must
remember
madam
that
up
to
this
time
the
young
lady
had
been
subjected
to
the
most
conventional
trammels
and
that
her
young
nature
had
just
burst
out
into
temporary
freedom
and
true
life
it
was
the
caged
bird
flight
into
the
bright
summer
air
just
the
kind
of
birds
said
aunt
martha
that
should
be
allowed
to
fly
at
least
until
they
are
used
to
it
but
you
can
go
on
with
your
story
well
said
the
young
man
the
next
day
we
met
i
took
her
to
the
piece
of
high
ground
i
had
mentioned
and
she
sketched
the
castle
after
that
we
met
again
and
again
nearly
every
day
this
sort
of
story
tells
itself
i
became
madly
in
love
with
her
and
i
am
sure
she
liked
me
very
well
at
all
events
i
was
a
companion
of
her
own
age
and
tastes
and
such
a
one
she
assured
me
she
had
never
known
before
and
probably
would
never
know
again
there
was
some
excuse
for
her
said
aunt
martha
but
still
she
had
no
right
to
act
in
that
way
especially
as
she
was
so
soon
to
be
married
i
do
not
think
that
she
reasoned
much
upon
the
subject
said
the
young
man
and
i
am
sure
i
did
not
we
made
no
plans
every
day
we
thought
only
of
what
we
were
doing
or
saying
and
not
at
all
what
we
had
done
or
would
do
we
were
very
happy
one
morning
i
was
sitting
by
marie
in
the
very
place
where
i
had
first
met
her
when
we
heard
some
one
rapidly
approaching
looking
up
i
saw
a
tall
man
in
military
uniform
cried
marie
is
colonel
kaldhein
the
situation
was
one
of
which
an
expectant
bridegroom
would
not
be
likely
to
ask
many
questions
marie
was
seated
on
a
low
stone
with
her
in
her
lap
she
was
finishing
the
sketch
on
which
she
was
engaged
when
i
first
saw
her
and
i
was
kneeling
close
to
her
looking
over
her
work
and
making
various
suggestions
and
i
think
my
countenance
must
have
indicated
that
i
found
it
very
pleasant
to
make
suggestions
in
that
way
to
such
a
pretty
girl
our
heads
were
very
close
together
sometimes
we
looked
at
the
paper
sometimes
we
looked
at
each
other
but
in
the
instant
i
caught
sight
of
the
colonel
the
situation
had
changed
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
marie
began
to
pick
up
the
drawing
materials
which
were
lying
about
her
colonel
kaldhein
came
forward
almost
at
a
run
his
eyes
blazed
through
his
gold
spectacles
and
his
reddish
beard
seemed
to
be
singeing
with
the
fires
of
rage
i
had
but
an
instant
for
observation
for
he
came
directly
up
to
me
and
with
a
tremendous
objurgation
he
struck
me
full
in
the
face
with
such
force
that
the
blow
stretched
me
upon
the
ground
i
was
almost
stunned
but
i
heard
a
scream
from
marie
a
storm
of
angry
words
from
kaldhein
and
i
felt
sure
he
was
about
to
inflict
further
injury
he
was
a
much
stronger
man
than
i
was
and
probably
was
armed
with
a
sudden
instinct
of
i
rolled
down
a
little
declivity
on
the
edge
of
which
i
had
fallen
and
staggering
to
my
feet
plunged
into
a
thicket
and
fled
even
had
i
been
in
the
full
possession
of
my
senses
i
knew
that
under
the
circumstances
i
would
have
been
of
no
benefit
to
marie
had
i
remained
upon
the
scene
the
last
thing
i
heard
was
a
shout
from
kaldhein
in
which
he
declared
that
he
would
kill
me
yet
for
some
days
i
did
not
go
out
of
my
castle
my
face
was
bruised
my
soul
was
dejected
i
knew
there
was
no
possible
chance
that
i
should
meet
marie
and
that
there
was
a
chance
that
i
might
meet
the
angry
colonel
an
altercation
at
this
time
would
be
very
annoying
and
painful
to
the
lady
no
matter
what
the
result
and
i
considered
it
my
duty
to
do
everything
that
was
possible
to
avoid
a
meeting
with
kaldhein
therefore
as
i
have
said
i
shut
myself
up
within
the
walls
of
old
wulrick
and
gave
strict
orders
to
my
servants
to
admit
no
one
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
strangest
events
of
my
life
occurred
sitting
in
an
upper
room
gazing
out
of
the
window
over
the
fields
through
which
i
had
walked
so
happily
but
two
days
before
to
meet
the
lady
whom
i
had
begun
to
think
of
as
my
marie
i
felt
the
head
of
a
dog
laid
gently
in
my
lap
without
turning
my
head
i
caressed
the
animal
and
stroked
the
long
hair
on
his
neck
my
hound
ajax
was
a
dear
companion
to
me
in
this
old
castle
although
i
never
took
him
in
my
walks
as
he
was
apt
to
get
into
mischief
and
when
i
turned
my
head
to
look
at
him
he
was
gone
but
strange
to
say
the
hand
which
had
been
stroking
the
dog
felt
as
if
it
were
still
resting
on
his
neck
quickly
drawing
my
hand
toward
me
it
struck
the
head
of
the
dog
and
moving
it
backward
and
forward
i
felt
the
ears
and
nose
of
the
animal
and
then
became
conscious
that
its
head
was
still
resting
upon
my
knee
i
started
back
had
i
been
stricken
with
blindness
but
no
turning
my
head
i
could
plainly
see
everything
in
the
room
the
scene
from
the
window
was
as
distinct
as
it
ever
had
been
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
as
i
stood
wondering
what
this
strange
thing
could
mean
the
dog
brushed
up
against
me
and
licked
my
hand
then
the
idea
suddenly
flashed
into
my
mind
that
by
some
occult
influence
ajax
had
been
rendered
invisible
i
dashed
and
although
i
could
neither
see
nor
hear
it
i
felt
that
the
dog
was
following
me
rushing
into
the
open
air
i
saw
one
of
my
men
is
ajax
i
cried
very
strange
thing
has
happened
sir
he
said
i
should
have
come
to
tell
you
of
it
had
i
not
been
unwilling
to
disturb
your
studies
about
two
hours
ago
ajax
was
lying
here
in
the
courtyard
suddenly
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
savage
growl
his
hair
stood
straight
upon
his
back
his
tail
was
stiff
and
his
lips
were
drawn
back
showing
his
great
teeth
i
turned
to
see
what
had
enraged
him
but
there
was
absolutely
nothing
sir
nothing
in
the
world
and
never
did
i
see
ajax
so
angry
but
this
lasted
only
for
an
instant
ajax
suddenly
backed
his
tail
dropped
between
his
legs
his
head
hung
down
and
with
a
dreadful
howl
he
turned
and
leaping
the
wall
of
the
courtyard
he
disappeared
i
have
since
been
watching
for
his
return
the
gate
is
open
and
as
soon
as
he
enters
i
shall
chain
him
for
i
fear
the
dog
is
mad
i
did
not
dare
to
utter
the
thoughts
that
were
in
my
mind
but
bidding
the
man
inform
me
the
moment
ajax
returned
i
reëntered
the
castle
and
sat
down
in
the
great
hall
the
dog
was
beside
me
his
head
again
lay
upon
my
knees
with
a
feeling
of
awe
yet
strangely
enough
without
fear
i
carefully
passed
my
hand
over
the
animal
head
i
felt
his
ears
his
nose
his
jaws
and
his
neck
they
were
not
the
head
the
ears
the
nose
the
jaws
or
the
neck
of
ajax
i
had
heard
of
animals
and
even
human
beings
who
were
totally
invisible
but
who
still
retained
their
form
their
palpability
and
all
the
powers
and
functions
of
life
i
had
heard
of
houses
haunted
by
invisible
animals
i
had
read
de
kay
story
of
the
maiden
whose
coming
her
lover
perceived
by
the
parting
of
the
tall
grain
in
the
field
of
ripe
wheat
through
which
she
passed
but
whose
form
although
it
might
be
folded
in
his
arms
was
yet
as
invisible
to
his
sight
as
the
summer
air
i
did
not
doubt
for
a
moment
that
the
animal
that
had
come
to
me
was
one
of
those
strange
beings
i
lifted
his
head
it
was
heavy
i
took
hold
of
a
paw
which
he
readily
gave
me
he
had
every
attribute
of
a
real
dog
except
that
he
could
not
be
seen
i
call
that
perfectly
horrible
said
aunt
martha
with
a
sort
of
a
gasp
perhaps
said
the
young
man
you
would
prefer
that
i
should
not
continue
at
this
both
my
wife
and
aunt
martha
declared
that
he
must
go
on
and
even
i
did
not
object
to
hearing
the
rest
of
the
story
well
said
the
young
man
ajax
never
came
back
it
is
generally
believed
that
dogs
can
see
things
which
are
invisible
to
us
and
i
am
afraid
that
my
faithful
hound
was
frightened
perhaps
to
death
when
he
found
that
the
animal
whose
entrance
into
the
courtyard
he
had
perceived
was
a
supernatural
thing
but
if
i
needed
a
canine
companion
i
had
one
for
by
day
or
night
this
invisible
dog
never
left
me
when
i
slept
he
lay
on
the
floor
by
the
side
of
my
bed
if
i
put
down
my
hand
i
could
always
feel
his
head
and
often
he
would
stand
up
and
press
his
nose
against
me
as
if
to
assure
me
that
he
was
there
this
strange
companionship
continued
for
several
days
and
i
became
really
attached
to
the
invisible
animal
his
constant
companionship
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
had
come
to
guard
me
and
that
he
was
determined
to
do
it
thoroughly
i
felt
so
much
confidence
in
his
protection
although
i
knew
not
how
it
could
be
exerted
that
one
morning
i
decided
to
take
a
walk
and
with
my
hand
on
the
head
of
the
dog
to
make
sure
that
he
was
with
me
i
strolled
into
the
open
country
i
had
walked
about
a
mile
and
was
approaching
a
group
of
large
trees
when
suddenly
from
behind
one
of
them
the
tall
figure
of
a
man
appeared
in
an
instant
i
knew
it
to
be
colonel
kaldhein
his
was
a
face
which
could
not
easily
be
forgotten
without
a
word
he
raised
a
pistol
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
fired
at
me
the
ball
whistled
over
my
head
i
stopped
short
startled
and
frightened
almost
out
of
my
senses
i
was
unarmed
and
had
no
place
of
refuge
it
was
plain
that
the
man
was
determined
to
kill
me
quickly
recocking
his
pistol
kaldhein
raised
it
again
i
involuntarily
shrank
back
expecting
death
but
before
he
could
fire
his
arm
suddenly
dropped
and
the
pistol
was
discharged
into
the
ground
then
began
a
strange
scene
the
man
shouted
kicked
and
beat
up
and
down
with
his
arms
his
pistol
fell
from
his
hand
he
sprang
from
side
to
side
he
turned
around
he
struggled
and
yelled
i
stood
astounded
for
an
instant
i
supposed
the
man
had
been
overtaken
by
some
sort
of
fit
but
in
a
flash
the
truth
came
to
me
kaldhein
was
being
attacked
by
my
protector
the
invisible
dog
horrified
by
this
conviction
my
first
impulse
was
to
save
the
man
and
without
knowing
what
i
was
going
to
do
i
stepped
quickly
toward
him
but
stumbling
over
something
i
did
not
see
i
fell
sprawling
before
i
could
regain
my
feet
i
saw
kaldhein
fall
backward
to
the
ground
where
a
scene
took
place
so
terrible
that
i
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
it
when
with
trembling
steps
i
approached
the
man
was
dead
the
invisible
dog
had
almost
torn
him
to
pieces
i
could
do
nothing
i
did
not
remain
upon
the
spot
another
minute
but
hurried
home
to
the
castle
as
i
rapidly
walked
on
i
felt
the
dog
beside
me
and
putting
my
hand
upon
him
i
felt
that
he
was
panting
terribly
for
three
days
i
did
not
leave
the
house
about
the
end
of
this
time
i
was
sitting
in
an
upper
room
of
the
castle
reflecting
upon
the
recent
dreadful
event
when
the
thought
struck
me
that
the
invisible
dog
who
was
by
my
side
apparently
asleep
must
be
of
an
unusually
powerful
build
to
overcome
so
easily
such
a
strong
man
as
kaldhein
i
felt
a
desire
to
know
how
large
the
creature
really
was
and
as
i
had
never
touched
any
portion
of
his
body
back
of
his
shoulders
i
now
passed
my
hand
along
his
back
i
was
amazed
at
his
length
and
when
i
had
moved
my
hand
at
least
seven
feet
from
his
head
it
still
rested
upon
his
body
and
then
the
form
of
that
body
began
to
change
in
a
manner
which
terrified
me
but
impelled
by
a
horrible
but
irresistible
curiosity
my
hand
moved
on
but
i
no
longer
touched
the
body
of
a
dog
the
form
beneath
my
hand
was
cylindrical
apparently
about
a
foot
in
diameter
as
my
hand
moved
on
the
diameter
diminished
and
the
skin
of
the
creature
became
cold
and
clammy
i
was
feeling
the
body
of
a
snake
i
now
had
reached
the
open
door
of
the
room
the
body
of
the
snake
extended
through
it
it
went
on
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
these
i
began
to
descend
my
heart
beating
fast
with
terror
my
face
blanched
i
am
sure
but
my
hand
still
moving
along
the
body
of
the
awful
creature
i
had
studied
zoology
giving
a
good
deal
of
attention
to
reptiles
and
i
knew
that
judged
by
the
ordinary
ratio
of
diminution
of
the
bodies
of
serpents
this
one
must
extend
a
long
distance
down
the
stairs
but
i
had
not
descended
more
than
a
dozen
steps
before
i
felt
a
shiver
beneath
my
hand
and
then
a
jerk
and
the
next
moment
the
snake
body
was
violently
drawn
upward
i
withdrew
my
hand
and
started
to
one
side
and
then
how
i
know
not
i
became
aware
that
the
dog
part
of
the
creature
was
coming
downstairs
i
now
became
possessed
by
a
wild
terror
the
creature
must
be
furious
that
i
had
discovered
his
real
form
he
had
always
been
careful
to
keep
his
head
toward
me
i
should
be
torn
to
pieces
as
kaldhein
had
been
down
the
stairs
i
dashed
across
the
courtyard
and
toward
a
lofty
old
tower
which
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
castle
i
ran
up
the
winding
stairs
of
this
with
a
speed
which
belongs
only
to
a
frantically
terrified
creature
until
i
reached
the
fourth
story
where
i
dashed
through
an
open
doorway
slammed
behind
me
an
iron
door
which
shut
with
a
spring
and
fell
gasping
upon
the
floor
in
less
than
a
minute
i
was
aware
by
a
slight
rattling
of
the
that
something
was
pushing
against
the
door
but
i
did
not
move
i
knew
that
i
was
safe
the
room
in
which
i
lay
was
a
prison
dungeon
and
in
it
in
the
olden
times
it
is
said
men
had
been
left
to
perish
escape
or
communication
with
the
outer
world
was
impossible
a
little
light
and
air
came
through
a
narrow
slit
in
the
wall
and
the
door
could
not
be
forced
i
knew
that
the
invisible
dog
or
whatever
it
was
could
not
get
in
unless
the
door
was
open
i
had
frequently
noticed
that
when
he
entered
a
room
it
was
through
an
open
door
and
i
sometimes
knew
of
his
approach
by
seeing
an
unlatched
door
open
without
visible
cause
so
feeling
secure
for
the
present
i
lay
and
gasped
and
panted
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
hours
however
i
was
seized
by
a
new
terror
how
was
i
ever
to
get
out
of
this
horrible
dungeon
even
if
i
made
up
my
mind
to
face
the
dog
trusting
that
he
had
recovered
from
his
momentary
anger
i
had
no
means
of
opening
the
door
and
as
to
making
any
one
hear
me
i
knew
that
was
impossible
i
had
no
hope
that
my
servants
would
seek
me
here
i
had
not
seen
any
one
when
i
ran
into
the
tower
and
if
they
should
discover
that
i
was
in
this
dungeon
how
could
they
open
the
door
the
key
was
in
my
possession
he
had
taken
it
to
vienna
to
exhibit
it
as
a
curiosity
to
some
of
his
mechanical
friends
he
believed
that
there
was
not
such
another
key
in
the
world
i
was
in
the
habit
of
making
long
absences
from
the
castle
and
if
i
should
be
looked
for
i
believed
that
the
tower
would
be
the
last
place
visited
night
came
on
the
little
light
in
the
room
vanished
and
hungry
thirsty
and
almost
hopeless
i
fell
asleep
during
the
night
there
was
a
most
dreadful
storm
the
thunder
roared
the
lightning
flashed
through
the
slit
in
the
wall
and
the
wind
blew
with
such
terrific
violence
that
the
tower
shook
and
trembled
after
a
time
i
heard
a
tremendous
crash
as
of
falling
walls
and
then
another
and
now
i
felt
the
wind
blowing
into
my
prison
there
was
no
further
sleep
for
me
trembling
with
a
fearful
apprehension
of
what
might
happen
next
i
cowered
against
the
wall
until
the
day
broke
and
then
i
perceived
that
in
front
of
me
was
a
great
hole
in
the
wall
of
the
dungeon
which
extended
for
more
than
a
yard
above
the
floor
i
sat
and
gazed
at
this
until
the
light
became
stronger
and
then
i
cautiously
approached
the
aperture
and
looked
out
nearly
the
whole
of
the
castle
lay
in
ruins
before
me
it
was
easy
to
see
what
had
happened
the
storm
had
demolished
the
crumbling
walls
of
the
old
building
and
the
tower
itself
frail
and
tottering
stood
alone
high
above
the
prostrate
ruins
if
the
winds
should
again
arise
it
must
fall
and
at
any
moment
its
shaken
foundations
might
give
way
beneath
it
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
which
had
been
caused
by
the
tearing
away
of
some
of
the
connection
between
the
tower
and
main
building
i
could
look
down
on
the
ground
below
covered
with
masses
of
jagged
stone
but
there
was
no
way
in
which
i
could
get
down
i
could
not
descend
that
perpendicular
wall
if
i
leaped
out
death
would
be
certain
as
i
crouched
at
the
opening
i
felt
the
head
of
a
dog
pushed
against
me
a
spasm
of
terror
ran
through
me
but
the
moment
the
creature
began
to
lick
my
hands
i
knew
that
i
had
nothing
to
fear
from
him
instantly
my
courage
returned
i
felt
that
he
was
my
protector
i
patted
his
head
and
he
renewed
his
caresses
passing
my
hand
over
him
i
found
he
was
holding
himself
in
his
present
position
by
means
of
his
forelegs
which
were
stretched
out
upon
the
floor
what
a
dog
this
must
be
who
could
climb
a
wall
but
i
gave
no
time
to
conjectures
of
this
sort
how
could
i
avail
myself
of
his
assistance
in
what
manner
could
he
enable
me
to
escape
from
that
dangerous
tower
suddenly
a
thought
came
to
me
i
remembered
the
snake
part
of
him
judging
from
the
ratio
of
diminution
which
i
have
mentioned
before
that
part
if
hanging
down
must
reach
nearly
if
not
quite
to
the
ground
by
taking
advantage
of
this
means
of
descent
i
might
be
saved
but
the
feat
would
require
dexterity
and
an
immense
amount
of
faith
this
portion
of
the
animal
was
invisible
how
could
i
know
how
long
it
was
but
there
was
no
time
for
consideration
the
wind
had
again
arisen
and
was
blowing
with
fury
the
tower
shook
beneath
me
at
any
moment
it
might
fall
if
i
should
again
escape
from
death
through
the
assistance
of
my
invisible
friend
i
must
avail
myself
of
that
assistance
instantly
i
stopped
and
felt
the
animal
he
still
hung
by
part
of
his
body
and
by
his
forelegs
to
the
floor
of
the
dungeon
and
by
reaching
out
i
could
feel
that
the
rest
of
him
extended
downward
i
therefore
seized
his
body
in
my
arms
threw
myself
out
of
the
aperture
and
began
to
slide
down
in
a
very
short
time
i
found
that
i
had
reached
the
snake
portion
of
the
creature
and
throwing
my
arms
and
legs
around
it
i
endeavoured
with
all
my
strength
to
prevent
a
too
rapid
descent
but
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
my
downward
progress
was
faster
than
i
would
have
wished
it
to
be
but
there
was
no
stopping
i
must
slip
down
in
these
moments
of
rapid
descent
my
mind
was
filled
with
wild
anxiety
concerning
the
form
to
which
i
was
clinging
i
remembered
in
a
flash
that
there
were
snakes
whose
caudal
extremity
dwindled
away
suddenly
into
a
point
this
one
might
do
so
and
at
any
instant
i
might
come
to
the
end
of
the
tail
and
drop
upon
the
jagged
stones
below
calculation
after
calculation
of
the
ratio
of
diminution
flashed
through
my
mind
during
that
awful
descent
my
whole
soul
was
centred
upon
one
point
when
would
this
support
end
when
would
i
drop
fortunately
i
was
on
the
leeward
side
of
the
tower
and
i
was
not
swung
about
by
the
wind
steadily
i
descended
and
steadily
the
diameter
of
the
form
i
grasped
diminished
soon
i
could
grasp
it
in
my
hand
then
with
a
terrified
glance
i
looked
below
i
was
still
at
a
sickening
distance
from
the
ground
i
shut
my
eyes
i
slipped
down
down
down
the
tail
became
like
a
thick
rope
which
i
encircled
with
each
hand
it
became
thinner
and
thinner
it
grew
so
small
that
i
could
not
hold
it
but
as
i
felt
it
slip
from
my
fingers
my
feet
rested
on
a
pile
of
stones
bewildered
and
almost
exhausted
i
stumbled
over
the
ruins
gained
the
unencumbered
ground
and
ran
as
far
from
the
tower
as
i
could
sinking
down
at
last
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
in
a
neighbouring
field
scarcely
had
i
reached
this
spot
when
the
fury
of
the
appeared
to
redouble
and
before
the
wild
and
shrieking
blast
the
tower
bent
and
then
fell
with
a
crash
upon
the
other
ruins
the
first
thought
that
came
into
my
mind
when
i
beheld
the
dreadful
spectacle
concerned
the
creature
who
had
twice
saved
my
life
had
he
escaped
or
was
he
crushed
beneath
that
mass
of
stone
i
felt
on
either
side
to
discover
if
he
were
near
me
but
he
was
not
had
he
given
his
life
for
mine
had
i
been
stronger
i
would
have
searched
for
him
i
would
have
clambered
among
the
ruins
to
see
if
i
could
discover
his
mangled
form
if
i
could
but
reach
his
faithful
head
i
would
stroke
and
caress
it
living
or
dead
but
excitement
fatigue
and
want
of
food
had
made
me
so
weak
that
i
could
do
nothing
but
sit
upon
the
ground
with
my
back
against
the
tree
while
thus
resting
i
perceived
that
the
whole
of
the
tower
had
not
been
demolished
by
the
storm
some
of
the
rooms
in
which
we
had
lived
having
been
built
at
a
later
date
than
the
rest
of
the
great
edifice
had
resisted
the
power
of
the
wind
and
were
still
standing
from
the
direction
of
the
uninjured
portion
of
the
castle
i
now
saw
approaching
a
object
which
seemed
to
be
floating
in
the
air
about
a
foot
from
the
ground
as
it
came
nearer
i
saw
that
it
was
a
basket
and
i
immediately
understood
the
situation
my
faithful
friend
was
alive
and
was
bringing
me
some
refreshments
on
came
the
basket
rising
and
falling
with
the
bounds
of
the
dog
it
was
truly
an
odd
spectacle
but
a
very
welcome
one
in
a
few
moments
the
basket
was
deposited
at
my
side
and
i
was
caressing
the
head
of
the
faithful
dog
in
the
basket
i
found
a
bottle
of
wine
and
some
bread
and
meat
which
the
good
creature
had
doubtless
discovered
in
the
kitchen
of
the
castle
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
was
myself
again
the
storm
had
now
almost
passed
away
and
i
arose
and
went
to
my
own
rooms
my
friend
and
protector
still
keeping
close
to
my
side
on
the
morning
of
the
next
day
as
i
sat
wondering
what
had
happened
to
my
servants
and
whether
my
father
had
been
apprised
of
the
disaster
to
the
castle
i
felt
something
pulling
at
the
skirt
of
my
coat
i
put
out
my
hand
and
found
that
it
was
the
invisible
dog
imagining
that
he
wished
me
to
follow
him
i
arose
and
obeying
the
impulse
given
me
by
his
gentle
strain
upon
my
coat
i
followed
him
out
of
the
door
across
the
courtyard
and
into
the
open
country
we
went
on
for
a
considerable
distance
a
gentle
touch
of
my
coat
admonished
me
when
i
turned
from
the
direction
in
which
it
was
desired
that
i
should
go
after
a
walk
of
about
half
an
hour
i
approached
a
great
with
low
branches
some
one
was
sitting
beneath
it
imagining
the
truth
i
rushed
forward
it
was
marie
it
was
needless
for
us
to
say
anything
to
explain
the
state
of
our
feelings
toward
each
other
that
tale
was
told
by
the
delight
with
which
we
met
when
i
asked
her
how
she
came
to
be
there
she
told
me
that
about
an
hour
before
while
sitting
in
front
of
her
father
mansion
she
had
felt
something
gently
pulling
at
her
skirts
and
although
at
first
frightened
she
was
at
length
impelled
to
obey
the
impulse
and
without
knowing
whether
it
was
the
wind
or
some
supernatural
force
which
had
led
her
here
she
had
come
we
had
a
great
deal
to
say
to
each
other
she
told
me
that
she
had
been
longing
to
send
me
a
message
to
warn
me
that
colonel
kaldhein
would
certainly
kill
me
the
next
time
he
saw
me
but
she
had
no
means
of
sending
me
such
a
message
for
the
colonel
had
had
her
actions
closely
watched
when
the
news
came
of
kaldhein
death
she
at
first
feared
that
i
had
killed
him
and
would
therefore
be
obliged
to
fly
the
country
but
when
it
was
known
that
he
had
been
almost
torn
to
pieces
by
wild
beasts
she
like
every
one
else
was
utterly
amazed
and
could
not
understand
the
matter
at
all
none
but
the
most
ferocious
creatures
could
have
inflicted
the
injuries
of
which
the
man
had
died
and
where
those
creatures
came
from
no
one
knew
some
people
thought
that
a
pack
of
might
have
broken
loose
from
some
of
the
estates
of
the
surrounding
country
and
in
the
course
of
their
wild
journeyings
might
have
met
with
the
colonel
and
fallen
upon
him
others
surmised
that
a
bear
had
come
down
from
the
mountains
but
the
fact
was
that
nobody
knew
anything
about
it
i
did
not
attempt
to
acquaint
marie
with
the
truth
at
that
moment
the
invisible
dog
was
lying
at
my
side
and
i
feared
if
i
mentioned
his
existence
to
marie
she
might
fly
in
terror
to
me
there
was
only
one
important
phase
of
the
affair
and
that
was
that
marie
was
now
free
that
she
might
be
mine
before
we
parted
we
were
affianced
lovers
pledged
to
marry
as
soon
as
possible
i
wrote
to
my
father
asking
for
his
permission
to
wed
the
lady
but
in
his
reply
he
utterly
forbade
any
such
marriage
marie
also
discovered
that
her
parents
would
not
permit
a
union
with
a
foreigner
and
would
indeed
oppose
her
marriage
with
any
one
at
this
time
however
as
usual
love
triumphed
and
after
surmounting
many
difficulties
we
were
married
and
fled
to
america
since
that
time
i
have
been
obliged
to
support
myself
and
my
wife
for
my
father
will
give
me
no
assistance
he
had
proposed
a
very
different
career
for
me
and
was
extremely
angry
when
he
found
his
plans
had
been
completely
destroyed
but
we
are
hopeful
we
work
hard
and
hope
that
we
may
yet
be
able
to
support
ourselves
comfortably
without
aid
from
any
one
we
are
young
we
are
strong
we
trust
each
other
and
have
a
firm
faith
in
our
success
i
had
only
one
regret
in
leaving
europe
and
that
was
that
my
faithful
friend
the
noble
and
devoted
invisible
dog
was
obliged
to
remain
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
why
this
was
so
i
do
not
know
but
perhaps
it
was
for
the
best
i
never
told
my
wife
of
his
existence
and
if
she
had
accidentally
discovered
it
i
know
not
what
might
have
been
the
effects
upon
her
nervous
system
the
dog
accompanied
me
through
austria
switzerland
and
france
to
havre
from
which
port
we
sailed
i
took
leave
of
him
on
the
he
licked
my
hands
and
i
caressed
and
stroked
him
people
might
have
thought
that
my
actions
denoted
insanity
but
every
one
was
so
greatly
occupied
in
these
last
moments
before
departure
that
perhaps
i
was
not
noticed
just
as
i
left
him
and
hastened
on
board
a
sailor
fell
overboard
from
the
he
was
quickly
rescued
but
could
not
imagine
why
he
had
fallen
i
believe
however
that
he
was
tripped
up
by
the
snake
part
of
my
friend
as
he
convulsively
rushed
away
the
young
man
ceased
and
gazed
pensively
upon
the
floor
well
well
well
exclaimed
aunt
martha
if
those
are
the
sort
of
experiences
you
had
i
do
wonder
that
realism
was
wonderful
enough
for
you
the
invisible
creature
was
very
good
to
you
i
am
sure
but
i
am
glad
it
did
not
come
with
you
to
america
david
who
had
been
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
speak
now
interrupted
further
comments
by
stating
that
it
was
daylight
and
if
i
thought
well
of
it
he
would
open
the
so
that
we
might
see
any
one
going
toward
the
town
a
milkman
he
said
passed
the
house
very
early
every
morning
when
the
shutters
were
opened
we
were
all
amazed
that
the
night
should
have
passed
so
quickly
the
tall
burglar
and
the
young
man
now
began
to
exhibit
a
good
deal
of
anxiety
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
said
the
former
what
you
intend
to
do
in
regard
to
us
it
can
not
be
that
you
think
of
placing
that
young
gentleman
and
myself
in
the
hands
of
the
law
of
course
this
man
pointing
to
the
stout
burglar
can
not
expect
anything
but
a
just
punishment
of
his
crimes
but
after
what
we
have
told
you
you
must
certainly
be
convinced
that
our
connection
with
the
affair
is
entirely
blameless
and
should
be
considered
as
a
piece
of
very
bad
luck
that
said
i
is
a
matter
which
will
receive
all
the
consideration
it
needs
at
this
moment
david
announced
the
milkman
counselling
my
man
to
keep
strict
guard
over
the
prisoners
i
went
out
to
the
road
stopped
the
milkman
and
gave
him
a
message
which
i
was
certain
would
insure
the
prompt
arrival
at
my
house
of
sufficient
force
to
take
safe
charge
of
the
burglars
excited
with
the
importance
of
the
commission
he
whipped
up
his
horse
and
dashed
away
when
i
returned
to
the
house
i
besought
my
wife
and
aunt
martha
to
go
to
bed
that
they
might
yet
get
some
hours
of
sleep
but
both
refused
they
did
not
feel
in
the
least
like
sleep
and
there
was
a
subject
on
which
they
wished
to
consult
with
me
in
the
now
said
aunt
martha
when
the
door
had
been
closed
these
men
have
freely
told
us
their
stories
whether
they
are
entirely
true
or
not
must
of
course
be
a
matter
of
opinion
but
they
have
laid
their
cases
before
us
and
we
should
not
place
them
all
in
the
hands
of
the
officers
of
the
law
without
giving
them
due
consideration
and
arriving
at
a
decision
which
shall
be
satisfactory
to
ourselves
let
us
take
them
in
order
said
i
what
do
you
think
of
the
tall
man
case
i
think
he
is
a
thief
and
manufacturer
of
falsehoods
said
my
wife
promptly
i
am
afraid
said
aunt
martha
that
he
is
not
altogether
innocent
but
there
is
one
thing
greatly
in
his
favour
when
he
told
of
the
feelings
which
overcame
him
when
he
saw
that
little
child
sleeping
peacefully
in
its
bed
in
the
house
which
he
had
unintentionally
robbed
i
felt
there
must
be
good
points
in
that
man
nature
what
do
you
think
of
him
i
think
he
is
worst
of
the
lot
i
answered
and
as
there
are
now
two
votes
against
him
he
must
go
to
the
and
now
what
of
the
stout
fellow
i
asked
oh
he
is
a
burglar
by
his
own
confession
said
my
wife
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
i
am
afraid
you
are
right
said
aunt
martha
i
know
she
is
said
i
and
james
barlow
or
whatever
his
name
may
be
shall
be
delivered
to
the
constable
of
course
there
can
be
no
difference
of
opinion
in
regard
to
the
young
man
said
aunt
martha
quickly
both
the
others
admitted
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
affair
except
as
a
journalist
and
although
i
do
not
think
he
ought
to
get
his
realistic
ideas
in
that
way
i
would
consider
it
positively
wicked
to
send
him
into
court
in
company
with
those
other
men
consider
the
position
in
which
he
would
be
placed
before
the
world
consider
his
young
wife
i
can
not
say
said
my
wife
that
i
am
inclined
to
believe
all
parts
of
his
story
i
suppose
said
i
laughing
that
you
particularly
refer
to
the
invisible
i
not
so
sure
about
all
that
she
answered
since
the
labours
of
the
psychic
researchers
began
we
have
heard
of
a
great
many
strange
things
but
it
is
evident
that
he
is
a
young
man
of
education
and
culture
and
in
all
probability
a
journalist
or
literary
man
i
do
not
think
he
should
be
sent
to
the
with
common
criminals
there
cried
aunt
martha
two
in
his
favour
he
must
be
released
it
a
poor
rule
that
does
not
work
both
ways
i
stood
for
a
few
moments
undecided
if
left
to
myself
i
would
have
sent
the
trio
to
the
county
town
where
if
any
one
of
them
could
prove
his
innocence
he
could
do
so
before
the
constitutional
authorities
but
having
submitted
the
matter
to
my
wife
and
aunt
i
could
not
well
override
their
decision
as
for
what
the
young
man
said
i
gave
it
no
weight
whatever
for
of
course
he
would
say
the
best
he
could
for
himself
but
the
testimony
of
the
others
had
weight
when
they
both
declared
that
he
was
not
a
burglar
but
merely
a
journalist
engaged
in
what
he
supposed
to
be
his
duty
it
would
seem
to
be
a
cruel
thing
to
stamp
him
as
a
criminal
by
putting
him
in
charge
of
the
constables
but
my
indecision
soon
came
to
an
end
for
aunt
martha
declared
that
no
time
should
be
lost
in
setting
the
young
man
free
for
should
the
people
in
town
arrive
and
see
him
sitting
bound
with
the
others
it
would
ruin
his
character
forever
my
wife
agreed
whatever
there
may
be
of
truth
in
his
story
she
said
one
of
two
things
is
certain
either
he
has
had
most
wonderful
experiences
out
of
which
he
may
construct
realistic
novels
which
will
give
him
fortune
and
reputation
or
he
has
a
startling
imagination
which
if
used
in
the
production
of
works
in
the
romantic
school
will
be
of
the
same
advantage
to
his
future
looking
upon
it
even
in
this
light
and
without
any
reference
to
his
family
and
the
possible
effects
on
his
own
moral
nature
we
shall
assume
a
great
responsibility
in
deliberately
subjecting
such
a
person
to
criminal
prosecution
and
perhaps
conviction
this
was
enough
well
said
i
we
will
release
the
young
fellow
and
send
the
two
other
rascals
to
jail
that
was
not
well
expressed
said
my
wife
but
we
will
not
criticise
words
at
present
we
returned
to
the
library
and
i
announced
my
decision
when
he
heard
it
the
stout
burglar
exhibited
no
emotion
his
expression
indicated
that
having
been
caught
he
expected
to
be
sent
to
jail
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
perhaps
he
had
been
through
this
experience
so
often
that
he
had
become
used
to
it
the
tall
man
however
took
the
announcement
in
a
very
different
way
his
face
grew
dark
and
his
eyes
glittered
you
are
making
a
great
mistake
he
said
to
me
a
very
great
mistake
and
you
will
have
to
bear
the
consequences
very
good
said
i
i
will
remember
that
remark
when
your
trial
comes
on
the
behaviour
of
the
young
man
was
unexceptional
he
looked
upon
us
with
a
face
full
of
happy
gratitude
and
as
he
thanked
us
for
the
kind
favour
and
the
justice
which
we
had
shown
him
his
eyes
seemed
dim
with
tears
aunt
martha
was
much
affected
i
wonder
if
his
mother
is
living
she
whispered
to
me
a
wife
is
a
great
deal
but
a
mother
is
more
if
i
had
thought
of
her
sooner
i
would
have
spoken
more
strongly
in
his
favour
and
now
you
should
untie
him
at
once
and
let
him
go
home
his
wife
must
be
getting
terribly
anxious
the
young
man
overheard
this
last
remark
you
will
confer
a
great
favour
on
me
sir
he
said
if
you
will
let
me
depart
as
soon
as
possible
i
feel
a
great
repugnance
to
be
seen
in
company
with
these
men
as
you
may
imagine
from
wearing
a
mask
on
coming
here
if
i
leave
immediately
i
think
i
can
catch
the
first
train
from
your
station
i
considered
the
situation
if
i
did
what
i
was
asked
there
would
be
two
bound
burglars
to
guard
three
women
and
a
child
to
protect
an
uncertain
stranger
at
liberty
and
only
david
and
myself
to
attend
to
the
whole
business
no
sir
said
i
i
shall
not
untie
you
until
the
officers
i
sent
for
are
near
at
hand
then
i
will
release
you
and
you
can
leave
the
house
by
the
back
way
without
being
seen
by
them
there
are
other
morning
trains
which
will
take
you
into
the
city
early
enough
i
think
you
are
a
little
hard
on
him
remarked
aunt
martha
but
the
young
man
made
no
complaint
i
will
trust
myself
to
you
sir
he
said
the
officers
arrived
much
sooner
than
i
expected
there
were
five
of
them
including
the
chief
of
police
and
they
were
accompanied
by
several
volunteer
assistants
among
whom
was
the
milkman
who
had
been
my
messenger
this
morning
his
customers
might
wait
for
their
milk
for
all
business
must
give
way
before
such
an
important
piece
of
sightseeing
as
this
i
had
barely
time
to
untie
the
young
man
and
take
him
to
the
back
of
the
house
before
the
officers
and
their
followers
had
entered
the
front
door
there
was
now
a
great
deal
of
questioning
a
great
deal
of
explanation
a
great
deal
of
discussion
as
to
whether
my
way
of
catching
burglars
was
advisable
or
not
and
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
the
best
method
of
taking
the
men
to
town
some
of
the
officers
were
in
favour
of
releasing
the
two
men
and
then
deciding
in
what
manner
they
should
be
taken
to
town
and
if
this
plan
had
been
adopted
i
believe
that
these
two
alert
and
practical
rascals
would
have
taken
themselves
out
of
my
house
without
the
assistance
of
the
officers
or
at
least
would
have
caused
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
perhaps
injury
in
endeavouring
to
do
so
but
the
chief
of
police
was
of
my
mind
and
before
the
men
were
entirely
released
from
the
ropes
by
which
i
had
tied
them
they
were
securely
manacled
a
requisition
made
on
david
and
myself
to
appear
as
witnesses
the
two
men
were
taken
from
the
house
to
the
wagons
in
which
the
officers
and
their
followers
had
come
my
wife
and
aunt
martha
had
gone
upstairs
before
the
arrival
of
the
police
and
were
watching
the
outside
proceeding
from
a
window
standing
in
the
hallway
i
glanced
into
the
and
was
surprised
to
see
the
young
man
still
standing
by
a
side
door
i
had
thought
him
gone
but
perhaps
it
was
wise
in
him
to
remain
and
not
show
himself
upon
the
road
until
the
coast
was
entirely
clear
he
did
not
see
me
and
was
looking
backward
into
the
kitchen
a
cheerful
and
animated
expression
upon
his
face
this
expression
did
not
strike
me
pleasantly
he
had
escaped
a
great
danger
it
was
true
but
it
was
no
reason
for
this
rather
obtrusive
air
of
exultation
just
then
alice
came
into
the
from
the
kitchen
and
the
young
man
stepped
back
so
that
she
did
not
notice
him
as
she
passed
he
gently
threw
his
arm
quietly
around
her
neck
and
kissed
her
at
that
very
instant
even
before
the
girl
had
time
to
exclaim
in
rushed
david
from
the
outer
side
door
i
been
watching
you
you
rascal
he
shouted
you
done
for
now
and
he
threw
his
strong
arms
around
the
man
pinioning
his
arms
to
his
side
the
young
fellow
gave
a
great
jerk
and
began
to
struggle
powerfully
his
face
turned
black
with
rage
he
swore
he
kicked
he
made
the
most
frenzied
efforts
to
free
himself
but
david
arms
were
strong
his
soul
was
full
of
jealous
fury
and
in
a
moment
i
had
come
to
his
assistance
each
of
us
taking
the
young
fellow
by
an
arm
we
ran
him
into
the
hallway
and
out
of
the
front
door
alice
aiding
us
greatly
by
putting
her
hands
against
the
man
back
and
pushing
most
forcibly
here
another
one
cried
david
i
appear
against
him
he
the
worst
of
the
lot
without
knowing
what
it
all
meant
the
chief
clapped
the
nippers
on
our
prisoner
justly
believing
that
if
burglars
were
about
to
show
themselves
so
unexpectedly
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
handcuff
them
as
fast
as
they
appeared
and
then
to
ask
questions
the
reasons
for
not
having
produced
this
man
before
and
for
producing
him
now
were
not
very
satisfactory
to
the
officer
have
you
any
more
in
the
cellar
he
asked
if
so
i
should
like
to
take
a
look
at
them
before
i
start
away
at
this
moment
aunt
martha
made
her
appearance
at
the
front
door
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
young
man
she
asked
sharply
what
right
have
you
to
put
irons
upon
him
aunt
martha
said
i
stepping
back
to
her
what
do
you
think
he
has
done
i
do
know
said
she
how
should
i
know
all
i
know
is
that
we
agreed
to
set
him
free
i
addressed
her
solemnly
david
and
i
believe
him
to
be
utterly
depraved
he
availed
himself
of
the
first
moments
of
his
liberation
to
kiss
alice
aunt
martha
looked
at
me
with
eyes
and
then
her
brows
contracted
he
did
did
he
said
she
and
that
is
the
kind
of
a
man
he
is
very
good
let
him
go
to
jail
with
the
others
i
do
believe
one
word
about
his
young
wife
if
kissing
respectable
young
women
is
the
way
he
studies
realism
the
quicker
he
goes
to
jail
the
better
and
with
that
she
walked
into
the
house
when
the
men
had
been
placed
in
the
two
vehicles
in
which
the
police
had
come
the
chief
and
i
made
an
examination
of
the
premises
and
we
found
that
the
house
had
been
entered
by
a
kitchen
window
in
exactly
the
manner
which
the
tall
burglar
had
described
outside
of
this
window
close
to
the
wall
we
found
a
leathern
bag
containing
what
the
chief
declared
to
be
an
excellent
assortment
of
burglars
tools
the
officers
and
their
prisoners
now
drove
away
and
we
were
left
to
a
long
morning
nap
if
we
were
so
fortunate
as
to
get
it
and
a
late
breakfast
in
the
course
of
the
trial
of
the
three
men
who
had
entered
my
house
some
interesting
points
in
regard
to
them
were
brought
out
several
detectives
and
policemen
from
new
york
were
present
and
their
testimony
proved
that
my
three
burglars
were
men
of
eminence
in
their
profession
and
that
which
most
puzzled
the
metropolitan
detectives
was
to
discover
why
these
men
should
have
been
willing
to
devote
their
high
talents
to
the
comparatively
insignificant
business
of
breaking
into
a
suburban
dwelling
the
tall
man
occupied
a
position
of
peculiar
eminence
in
criminal
circles
he
was
what
might
be
called
a
criminal
manager
he
would
take
contracts
for
the
successful
execution
of
certain
crimes
bank
robberies
for
instance
and
while
seldom
taking
part
in
the
actual
work
of
a
burglary
or
similar
operation
he
would
plan
all
the
details
of
the
affair
and
select
and
direct
his
agents
with
great
skill
and
judgment
he
had
never
been
arrested
before
and
the
detectives
were
delighted
believing
they
would
now
have
an
opportunity
of
tracing
to
him
a
series
of
very
important
criminal
operations
that
had
taken
place
in
new
york
and
some
other
large
cities
he
was
known
as
lewis
mandit
and
this
was
believed
to
be
his
real
name
the
stout
man
was
a
professional
burglar
and
nothing
more
and
was
in
the
employ
of
mandit
the
young
man
was
a
decidedly
uncommon
personage
he
was
of
a
good
family
had
been
educated
at
one
of
our
principal
colleges
had
travelled
and
was
in
every
way
qualified
to
make
a
figure
in
society
he
had
been
a
newspaper
man
and
a
writer
for
leading
periodicals
and
had
shown
considerable
literary
ability
but
a
life
of
honest
industry
did
not
suit
his
tastes
and
he
had
now
adopted
knavery
as
a
regular
profession
this
man
who
was
known
among
his
present
associates
as
sparky
still
showed
himself
occasionally
in
newspaper
offices
and
was
generally
supposed
to
be
a
correspondent
for
a
western
journal
but
his
real
business
position
was
that
of
mandit
head
man
sparky
was
an
expert
in
many
branches
of
crime
he
was
an
excellent
forger
a
skilful
an
ingenious
planner
of
shady
projects
and
had
given
a
great
deal
of
earnest
study
to
the
subject
of
the
loopholes
of
the
law
he
had
a
high
reputation
in
criminal
circles
for
his
ability
in
getting
his
out
of
jail
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
in
the
past
year
no
less
than
nine
men
some
condemned
to
terms
of
imprisonment
and
some
held
for
trial
had
escaped
by
means
of
assistance
given
them
by
sparky
his
methods
of
giving
help
to
were
various
sometimes
liberty
was
conferred
through
the
agency
of
saws
and
ropes
at
other
times
through
that
of
a
habeas
corpus
and
an
incontestible
alibi
his
means
were
adapted
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
it
was
believed
that
if
sparky
could
be
induced
to
take
up
the
case
of
a
captured
rogue
the
man
had
better
chance
of
finding
himself
free
than
the
law
had
of
keeping
him
behind
bars
especially
if
his
case
were
treated
before
it
had
passed
into
its
more
chronic
stages
sparky
success
was
greatly
due
to
his
extremely
specious
manner
and
his
power
of
playing
the
part
that
the
occasion
demanded
in
this
particular
he
was
even
the
superior
of
mandit
who
was
an
adept
in
this
line
these
two
men
found
no
difficulty
in
securing
the
services
of
proficient
burglars
and
the
like
for
in
addition
to
the
high
rewards
paid
these
men
they
were
in
a
manner
insured
against
permanent
imprisonment
in
case
of
misfortune
it
was
always
arranged
that
if
any
of
their
enterprises
came
to
grief
and
if
either
mandit
or
sparky
should
happen
to
be
arrested
the
working
miscreants
should
substantiate
any
story
their
superiors
might
choose
to
tell
of
themselves
and
if
necessary
to
take
upon
themselves
the
whole
responsibility
of
the
crime
in
this
case
their
speedy
release
was
to
be
looked
upon
as
assured
a
great
deal
of
evidence
in
regard
to
the
character
and
practices
of
these
two
men
came
from
the
stout
burglar
commonly
known
as
barney
fitch
when
he
found
that
nothing
was
to
be
expected
from
his
two
astute
employers
and
that
they
were
in
as
bad
a
place
as
himself
he
promptly
turned
state
evidence
and
told
all
that
he
knew
about
them
it
was
through
the
testimony
of
this
man
that
the
motive
for
the
attempted
robbery
of
my
house
was
found
out
it
had
no
connection
whatever
with
the
other
burglaries
of
our
neighbourhood
those
probably
having
been
committed
by
thieves
who
had
not
broken
into
my
house
simply
because
my
doors
and
windows
had
been
so
well
secured
nor
had
our
boy
george
william
any
share
whatever
in
the
protection
of
the
household
the
burglary
was
undertaken
solely
for
the
purpose
of
getting
possession
of
some
important
law
papers
which
were
to
be
used
in
a
case
in
which
i
was
concerned
which
soon
would
be
tried
if
these
papers
could
be
secured
by
the
opposite
party
the
side
on
which
i
was
engaged
would
have
no
case
at
all
and
a
suit
involving
a
great
deal
of
property
must
drop
with
this
end
in
view
the
unscrupulous
defendants
in
the
case
had
employed
mandit
to
procure
the
papers
and
that
astute
criminal
manager
had
not
only
arranged
all
the
details
of
the
affair
but
had
gone
himself
to
the
scene
of
action
in
order
to
see
that
there
should
be
no
mistake
in
carrying
out
the
details
of
this
most
important
piece
of
business
the
premises
had
been
thoroughly
reconnoitred
by
sparky
who
a
few
days
before
the
time
fixed
for
the
burglary
had
visited
my
house
in
the
capacity
of
an
agent
of
a
telescopic
bookcase
which
could
be
extended
as
new
volumes
were
required
therefore
need
never
exhibit
empty
shelves
the
young
man
had
been
included
in
the
party
on
account
of
his
familiarity
with
legal
documents
it
being
of
course
of
paramount
importance
that
the
right
papers
should
be
secured
his
ingenuity
was
also
to
be
used
to
cover
up
if
possible
all
evidence
that
the
house
had
been
entered
at
all
it
being
desirable
to
make
it
appear
to
the
court
that
i
had
never
had
these
documents
in
my
possession
and
that
they
never
existed
had
it
not
been
for
a
very
natural
desire
for
refreshment
that
interfered
with
their
admirably
laid
plans
it
is
probable
that
the
mechanical
skill
of
mandit
would
have
been
equal
to
the
noiseless
straightening
of
the
bent
bolt
and
the
obliteration
of
the
scratches
and
dents
made
by
the
attempts
upon
other
shutters
and
that
sparky
after
relocking
all
open
desks
or
cabinets
and
after
the
exit
of
the
others
would
have
closed
and
fastened
the
kitchen
shutters
and
would
then
have
left
the
house
by
means
of
an
open
window
in
the
upper
hall
and
the
roof
of
a
piazza
thus
it
was
that
these
three
men
so
eminent
in
their
different
spheres
of
earnest
endeavour
came
to
visit
my
comparatively
humble
abode
and
thus
it
was
that
they
not
only
came
to
that
abode
but
to
the
deepest
grief
they
were
wanted
in
so
many
quarters
and
on
so
many
charges
that
before
they
had
finished
serving
out
their
various
sentences
their
ability
to
wickedly
avail
themselves
of
the
property
of
others
would
have
suffered
greatly
from
disuse
and
the
period
of
life
left
them
for
the
further
exercise
of
those
abilities
would
be
inconveniently
limited
i
was
assured
by
a
prominent
detective
that
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
two
such
dangerous
criminals
as
mandit
and
sparky
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
law
these
men
by
means
of
very
competent
outside
assistance
made
a
stout
fight
for
acquittal
on
some
of
the
charges
brought
against
them
but
when
they
found
that
further
effort
of
this
kind
would
be
unavailing
and
that
they
would
be
sentenced
to
long
terms
of
imprisonment
they
threw
off
their
masks
of
outraged
probity
and
stood
out
in
their
true
characters
of
violent
and
brutal
ruffians
barney
fitch
the
cracksman
was
a
senior
warden
compared
to
them
it
was
a
long
time
before
my
aunt
martha
recovered
from
her
disappointment
in
regard
to
the
youngest
burglar
of
course
i
was
mistaken
she
said
that
sort
of
thing
will
happen
but
i
really
had
good
grounds
for
believing
him
to
be
a
truthful
person
so
i
am
not
ashamed
for
having
taken
him
for
what
he
said
he
was
i
have
now
no
doubt
before
he
fell
in
his
wicked
ways
that
he
was
a
very
good
writer
and
might
have
become
a
novelist
or
a
magazine
author
but
his
case
is
a
very
sad
proof
that
the
study
of
realism
may
be
carried
too
far
and
she
heaved
a
sigh
the
end
