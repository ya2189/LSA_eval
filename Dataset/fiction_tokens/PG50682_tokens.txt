the
characters
and
situations
in
this
book
are
wholly
fictional
and
imaginative
they
do
not
portray
and
are
not
intended
to
portray
any
actual
persons
or
the
planet
mappers
as
he
heard
that
dread
yet
telltale
against
the
hull
of
their
spaceboat
young
jon
carver
dropped
his
reelbook
and
sprang
to
his
feet
his
eyes
looked
swiftly
to
help
his
ears
trace
the
sudden
he
knew
was
their
precious
air
escaping
in
the
back
of
his
mind
he
heard
the
sudden
grunt
his
father
made
the
sound
of
a
falling
body
his
mother
frightened
scream
and
his
brother
what
wrong
but
he
did
not
stop
his
own
lanky
gangling
body
in
its
leap
toward
the
outer
bulkhead
and
as
he
jumped
he
pulled
his
handkerchief
from
his
hip
pocket
leaping
tuna
if
that
is
fixed
quick
we
lose
our
air
was
his
thought
we
wo
be
able
to
get
where
we
going
be
lucky
if
we
come
out
of
it
alive
so
guided
by
the
whistling
escaping
air
jon
found
the
hole
nearly
half
an
inch
in
diameter
into
it
he
wadded
the
corner
of
the
cloth
as
best
he
could
the
outward
loss
of
their
precious
air
slackened
although
there
was
still
some
leakage
he
could
not
stop
this
way
he
jumped
to
the
nearest
of
the
many
emergency
repair
kits
scattered
about
the
ship
from
it
he
grabbed
a
metal
patch
and
an
electric
torch
swiftly
he
plugged
the
latter
into
a
wall
socket
with
it
he
quickly
welded
the
patch
into
place
after
pulling
with
considerable
difficulty
his
handkerchief
from
the
hole
it
do
for
now
he
decided
after
carefully
examining
his
work
and
listening
closely
to
make
sure
there
was
no
more
of
air
but
we
have
to
go
outside
and
really
fill
in
and
that
hole
in
the
hull
but
quick
he
the
torch
then
opened
a
flagon
of
emergency
mixture
in
front
of
the
electric
blowers
that
kept
their
air
circulating
to
replenish
what
had
been
lost
only
then
although
it
had
been
less
than
two
minutes
really
did
he
turn
back
to
the
rest
of
the
family
he
had
been
somewhat
surprised
that
his
father
had
not
come
to
help
him
he
had
not
been
at
all
surprised
that
his
brother
had
not
jak
was
a
grand
guy
jon
thought
the
world
of
him
but
he
just
was
worth
a
dead
salmon
in
an
emergency
like
this
he
did
not
have
a
mechanical
type
of
mind
now
as
he
turned
jon
saw
his
mother
and
brother
kneeling
beside
the
prone
body
of
his
father
and
noted
with
astonishment
that
she
was
crying
there
was
something
stiff
and
unnatural
about
the
man
body
too
lying
there
on
the
deck
beside
his
recline
seat
a
sudden
fear
sent
the
boy
leaping
across
the
room
what
what
happened
pop
is
dead
is
he
no
something
made
him
fall
and
he
hit
his
head
on
the
deck
and
knocked
himself
out
jak
said
without
looking
up
his
foot
caught
in
the
footrest
and
as
he
fell
over
the
seat
arm
his
leg
broke
jon
dropped
to
his
knees
beside
his
weeping
mother
and
threw
an
arm
about
her
his
eyes
were
wide
and
damp
with
swift
tears
for
in
spite
of
the
rapid
growth
his
body
had
undergone
in
the
past
few
years
he
was
still
only
sixteen
and
he
loved
this
splendid
father
of
his
with
genuine
devotion
it
just
could
be
that
pop
would
live
he
thought
in
panic
he
could
make
himself
believe
that
he
might
no
longer
have
the
wonderful
companionship
and
guidance
and
counsel
of
this
grand
man
who
had
been
his
world
his
mother
seeming
to
realize
what
the
boy
was
undergoing
forced
back
her
own
grief
to
turn
and
gather
this
younger
son
into
her
arms
comforting
him
as
only
mothers
can
they
watched
the
elder
brother
swift
competent
hands
as
he
bathed
with
soft
cotton
soaked
in
some
kind
of
medicine
taken
from
the
open
kit
beside
him
the
bruised
place
on
the
back
of
the
head
jak
had
already
shaved
away
the
hair
about
this
bruise
now
he
took
an
atomizer
and
sprayed
on
a
clear
plastic
bandage
mrs
carver
turned
anxiously
to
her
younger
son
jon
you
know
how
to
run
the
ship
turn
it
around
and
get
us
back
to
the
nearest
hospital
as
fast
as
it
will
go
jon
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
for
it
had
never
before
occurred
to
him
that
she
did
not
know
at
least
something
about
astrogation
we
ca
mom
you
do
run
a
ship
in
space
like
you
do
a
ground
car
we
on
negative
acceleration
now
but
it
be
close
to
two
days
before
we
slowed
enough
for
any
kind
of
maneuvering
that
right
mother
jak
came
unexpectedly
to
his
brother
aid
you
ca
stop
or
turn
a
spaceship
at
will
but
i
do
think
we
need
worry
too
much
father
head
wound
is
not
serious
although
there
a
slight
concussion
and
we
can
set
his
leg
so
it
will
heal
straight
it
a
clean
break
besides
it
would
take
at
least
a
month
to
get
back
to
the
nearest
colonized
planet
jon
took
up
the
explanation
you
know
we
almost
six
weeks
out
of
terra
mrs
carver
still
looked
doubtful
but
responded
as
did
jon
when
jak
began
issuing
instructions
to
them
to
help
him
in
setting
the
broken
leg
he
had
cut
away
the
trousers
and
removed
the
boot
and
sock
now
he
asked
his
mother
to
grasp
his
father
shoulders
and
hold
tightly
he
then
showed
jon
how
to
hold
the
toes
and
heel
of
the
injured
leg
and
pull
steadily
downward
while
he
manipulated
the
bone
ends
into
place
when
the
break
had
been
adjusted
jak
dissolved
certain
plastics
into
a
heavy
viscous
liquid
which
he
sprayed
onto
the
leg
this
mixture
hardened
almost
instantly
forming
a
cast
that
was
far
stiffer
and
yet
less
weighty
than
either
the
ancient
plaster
casts
or
cumbersome
splints
when
it
was
finished
they
all
rose
and
while
their
mother
hurried
ahead
to
prepare
the
bunk
the
boys
stooped
and
lifted
their
inert
body
staggering
a
bit
under
the
load
yet
handling
him
tenderly
they
carried
him
to
his
wall
bunk
and
lowered
him
onto
the
sheeted
mattress
after
their
mother
had
tucked
in
the
top
sheet
and
blankets
the
boys
buckled
the
acceleration
straps
about
the
bunk
and
jak
made
an
extra
binder
with
a
folded
blanket
about
the
broken
leg
now
if
their
father
regained
consciousness
or
moved
about
restlessly
in
partial
awakening
he
could
not
fall
out
and
perhaps
hurt
himself
more
when
all
had
been
done
to
make
the
wounded
man
as
comfortable
as
possible
mrs
carver
turned
to
jon
questioningly
what
happened
son
do
you
know
meteoroid
broached
the
hull
then
must
have
gone
on
and
almost
hit
pop
if
it
was
a
close
miss
the
force
of
its
passage
must
have
made
him
duck
and
fall
but
i
do
feel
any
air
escaping
there
is
now
i
patched
the
hole
inside
temporary
job
though
pop
he
stopped
in
sudden
realization
then
straightened
resolutely
and
his
voice
was
calmer
more
sure
as
he
went
on
i
mean
have
to
go
outside
and
make
a
permanent
weld
might
as
well
do
it
now
his
mother
face
showed
the
pride
she
felt
in
this
young
son
who
could
plan
and
do
the
things
that
had
to
be
done
even
while
she
knew
he
was
upset
by
his
father
accident
yes
it
should
be
done
at
once
but
she
gripped
his
arm
convulsively
be
sure
your
lifeline
is
fastened
securely
jon
he
patted
her
hand
awkwardly
i
will
mom
i
been
outside
a
lot
you
know
and
understand
just
what
to
do
he
broke
away
and
ran
toward
the
airlock
from
the
closet
just
inside
the
inner
lockdoor
he
took
his
spacesuit
and
put
it
on
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
was
still
working
on
the
zippered
seam
down
the
front
smearing
on
the
plastic
that
made
it
doubly
airtight
when
his
brother
came
in
can
i
help
chubby
sure
give
me
a
hand
with
my
helmet
say
owl
will
pop
really
be
all
ok
i
i
think
so
he
got
a
bad
smack
when
he
fell
but
his
heart
seems
to
be
beating
strongly
and
i
think
the
concussion
wear
off
soon
the
leg
heal
but
he
be
out
of
commission
about
six
weeks
he
picked
up
the
quartzite
fishbowl
and
slipped
it
over
jon
head
they
settled
it
firmly
in
place
on
the
and
screwed
tight
the
lugs
that
held
it
in
place
as
jon
turned
on
his
oxygen
he
motioned
to
the
plastic
and
jak
smeared
it
carefully
all
around
the
seam
when
he
had
finished
jon
increased
the
oxygen
flow
until
the
suit
bulged
while
jak
minutely
inspected
every
point
for
any
possible
leakage
finding
none
he
made
the
ok
sign
with
thumb
and
bent
forefinger
and
jon
reduced
his
and
opened
the
escape
valve
until
the
suit
deflated
enough
so
he
could
move
about
easily
from
a
chest
of
repair
supplies
the
younger
boy
took
a
can
of
and
a
acetylene
torch
these
he
fastened
to
his
belt
while
jak
was
getting
from
a
wall
hook
a
coil
of
thin
but
terrifically
strong
light
plastic
rope
that
would
neither
freeze
nor
lose
its
pliability
in
the
utter
cold
of
space
while
spacesuits
had
magnetic
shoe
soles
to
keep
their
wearers
in
contact
with
the
hull
a
lifeline
was
a
safety
factor
in
case
they
happened
to
break
that
contact
and
drift
away
from
the
ship
jon
checked
his
suit
and
equipment
again
making
sure
he
had
all
the
tools
he
might
need
and
that
they
were
firmly
in
place
he
snapped
one
end
of
his
lifeline
into
a
ring
at
his
belt
tugging
strongly
on
it
several
times
then
he
turned
and
grinned
through
the
helmet
at
his
elder
brother
he
waved
him
away
from
the
inner
lockdoor
then
pressed
a
button
the
inner
door
swung
open
and
air
rushed
in
to
fill
the
vacuum
between
the
inner
and
outer
lockdoors
jon
stepped
into
the
narrow
space
skirted
the
handling
mechanism
there
then
pressed
another
button
to
actuate
the
motor
that
closed
and
locked
the
inner
door
when
the
red
signal
light
told
him
it
was
airtight
he
switched
on
the
pump
that
returned
the
air
to
the
body
of
the
ship
the
lock
empty
he
twisted
the
knob
that
opened
the
outer
lockdoor
then
snapped
the
other
end
of
his
lifeline
to
a
ring
just
beside
the
opening
doorway
he
switched
on
his
as
he
felt
the
chill
of
space
slowly
ponderously
the
mechanism
swung
the
great
outer
door
partially
open
and
jon
was
facing
deep
space
although
he
had
spent
nearly
a
third
of
his
life
out
here
it
was
a
sight
that
never
tired
the
boy
active
imaginative
mind
and
even
now
he
stood
for
a
long
minute
eagerly
looking
outward
the
awesome
blackness
of
the
void
seemed
alive
with
millions
upon
countless
millions
of
tiny
distant
pinpointed
lights
he
knew
were
giant
suns
on
and
on
they
stretched
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
and
beyond
in
the
far
far
distance
were
blotches
of
light
jon
knew
were
the
incredibly
distant
nebulae
other
uncounted
billions
of
suns
that
made
up
the
galaxies
and
universes
he
looked
overhead
picking
out
against
the
backdrop
of
the
nearer
suns
of
our
own
galaxy
the
milky
way
some
of
the
larger
giant
suns
canopus
rigel
deneb
betelgeuse
antares
and
others
he
knew
by
sight
the
patterns
familiar
on
terra
were
somewhat
distorted
here
because
of
the
difference
in
distance
and
his
line
of
sight
but
those
suns
could
not
be
mistaken
he
only
stood
there
for
a
moment
then
he
reached
out
carefully
and
grasped
the
rung
of
the
metal
ladder
welded
onto
the
hull
and
which
ran
completely
around
the
ship
he
pulled
himself
onto
this
and
held
there
while
he
estimated
where
that
hole
should
be
about
feet
to
the
left
and
one
or
two
lower
than
the
doortop
i
think
he
muttered
to
himself
he
climbed
several
rungs
then
and
set
first
one
foot
and
then
the
other
firmly
and
flatly
onto
the
hull
beside
the
ladder
rungs
he
tried
each
of
his
shoes
making
sure
their
magnetic
soles
were
gripping
tightly
against
the
hull
surface
then
he
let
loose
the
ladder
and
stood
upright
compared
to
the
decks
inside
he
was
at
right
angles
but
there
is
no
up
down
or
sideways
in
space
except
that
your
feet
always
seem
down
assured
that
his
shoes
were
holding
firmly
he
slid
first
one
foot
and
then
the
other
along
the
hull
in
this
way
he
walked
ahead
always
in
full
contact
yet
able
to
progress
almost
at
a
normal
pace
he
counted
his
steps
and
when
he
felt
he
was
near
the
hole
for
which
he
was
looking
stooped
and
began
searching
about
the
surface
more
minutely
his
estimate
had
been
close
and
it
took
him
only
a
moment
to
find
the
place
where
the
meteoroid
had
struck
he
drew
his
lifeline
taut
and
tied
the
loop
to
his
belt
leaving
the
end
of
the
line
still
snapped
in
place
now
even
though
his
knot
might
come
loose
he
was
still
fastened
to
the
ship
he
took
the
can
of
from
his
belt
pouch
fumbling
a
bit
because
it
was
difficult
working
with
such
heavy
gloves
as
those
attached
to
his
spacesuit
there
was
plenty
of
light
from
the
billions
of
stars
nor
did
it
matter
what
hour
the
ship
chronoms
might
indicate
inside
it
was
always
the
same
out
here
he
squatted
down
still
keeping
both
feet
flat
against
the
outer
skin
of
the
ship
carefully
he
poured
some
of
the
sluggish
viscous
liquid
metal
into
the
hole
which
was
over
an
inch
wide
at
the
hull
surface
then
he
unslung
his
torch
he
snapped
the
lighter
and
adjusted
the
flame
to
a
narrow
pencil
beam
with
the
beam
he
melted
the
he
had
poured
into
the
hole
in
the
cold
depths
of
space
where
the
temperature
was
about
absolute
zero
the
metal
cooled
almost
instantly
as
he
turned
his
torch
away
he
then
added
more
seal
melted
that
then
more
seal
and
so
on
a
bit
at
a
time
until
the
hole
was
completely
filled
and
the
hull
surface
once
again
smooth
and
even
satisfied
at
last
that
the
damage
to
the
ship
was
completely
repaired
he
hooked
his
torch
to
his
belt
once
more
recapped
the
can
of
remaining
and
stored
it
in
his
belt
pouch
he
rose
and
stood
again
for
a
few
short
moments
looking
at
the
glory
of
the
universe
as
it
can
only
be
seen
from
a
spaceship
then
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
lock
and
entered
the
ship
he
touched
the
stud
and
the
motor
slowly
closed
the
great
outer
door
when
the
red
signal
light
showed
it
was
airtight
he
punched
the
other
button
air
filled
the
entry
and
then
the
inner
door
opened
he
went
through
into
the
ship
closed
the
inner
door
and
when
that
was
tight
started
the
motor
that
pumped
the
precious
air
from
the
lock
back
into
the
ship
his
brother
had
not
stayed
around
to
help
him
so
jon
had
to
strip
the
plastic
from
his
zipper
and
around
the
base
of
his
helmet
by
himself
it
was
an
awkward
job
as
was
trying
to
unscrew
the
lugs
at
the
back
of
his
shoulders
and
he
growled
a
bit
beneath
his
breath
because
jak
had
not
waited
nor
come
back
to
help
him
but
his
irritation
quickly
passed
and
he
grinned
to
himself
he
knew
his
brother
so
well
jak
simply
had
not
thought
to
stay
and
help
or
he
would
willingly
have
done
so
jak
tastes
and
desires
ran
more
to
other
things
jon
knew
to
medicine
and
to
all
growing
things
whether
plant
animal
or
human
jak
had
always
been
far
more
interested
in
what
made
grow
and
perform
its
miracles
than
he
had
in
how
and
why
operated
and
jon
acknowledged
honestly
it
was
a
good
thing
for
them
all
in
this
present
emergency
if
good
old
jak
was
half
a
doctor
already
pop
would
really
be
in
a
bad
way
and
so
would
all
of
them
if
they
lost
that
steady
and
competent
prop
on
whom
they
all
leaned
so
confidently
i
sure
would
have
known
what
to
do
jon
admitted
to
himself
as
the
thought
of
his
father
made
him
hurry
the
removing
of
his
suit
i
probably
would
have
run
for
my
tool
kit
not
the
one
he
finally
got
the
suit
off
and
hung
it
back
in
the
closet
he
gathered
up
the
scraps
of
used
plastic
and
stuffed
them
into
the
trash
disposal
chute
then
he
ran
into
the
living
room
and
on
to
the
side
of
his
father
bunk
where
his
mother
and
brother
were
standing
watching
how
is
he
just
the
same
you
sure
he
he
is
no
he
still
alive
and
i
sure
he
pull
out
in
time
only
question
is
how
long
it
take
jon
mind
began
churning
with
problems
what
would
they
do
while
pop
was
out
who
was
to
run
the
ship
make
the
calculations
on
orbits
and
trajectories
who
to
handle
the
controls
of
landing
when
we
reach
our
destination
which
wo
be
very
long
now
who
do
the
thousand
and
one
things
pop
has
always
done
who
make
the
decisions
again
the
sense
and
knowledge
of
his
personal
loss
came
home
and
young
jon
carver
sank
onto
the
deck
of
the
bunkroom
again
he
was
just
a
boy
who
had
lost
his
dearest
pal
his
ideal
pop
just
could
die
help
him
with
his
problems
teach
him
the
many
things
he
was
always
wanting
to
know
it
just
could
be
that
there
would
be
no
more
of
those
tussles
of
friendly
play
those
boxing
matches
or
wrestling
bouts
by
which
his
growing
body
adjusted
to
swift
action
and
hard
knocks
he
could
not
make
himself
believe
that
there
would
be
no
more
of
those
hours
of
practical
instruction
or
the
long
pleasant
evenings
when
the
big
man
would
talk
of
the
places
where
he
had
been
the
things
he
had
seen
and
done
in
his
travels
about
the
galaxy
for
tad
carver
was
one
of
the
real
pioneers
of
deep
space
he
had
been
an
officer
of
the
first
ship
to
reach
the
stars
the
planets
of
sirius
travel
was
not
yet
a
commonplace
thing
although
it
was
becoming
so
more
swiftly
with
each
passing
year
jon
knew
that
there
were
now
regular
trips
to
the
planets
and
some
of
the
moons
of
his
home
solar
system
one
could
have
a
two
weeks
vacation
trip
from
terra
to
luna
for
a
thousand
credits
or
a
month
cruise
to
mars
or
venus
for
forty
hundred
merchant
ships
made
fairly
regular
voyages
to
the
planets
of
sirius
and
vega
and
less
often
to
one
or
two
other
even
more
distant
worlds
which
had
been
found
to
contain
friendly
and
civilized
beings
not
all
of
them
humanoid
who
were
glad
to
engage
in
commerce
other
spaceships
plied
between
terra
and
the
many
newly
discovered
worlds
that
were
being
colonized
by
earth
people
but
it
had
been
men
like
tad
carver
who
had
bought
ships
and
surveyed
the
spaceways
it
was
they
who
had
opened
up
those
parts
of
the
galaxy
so
far
charted
and
who
incidentally
had
made
fortunes
for
themselves
from
the
metals
strange
jewels
and
other
rare
objects
they
had
discovered
and
brought
back
and
for
which
the
rich
of
terra
had
paid
so
willingly
and
so
handsomely
that
was
why
after
a
number
of
years
and
many
such
trips
carver
had
been
able
to
buy
his
own
small
ship
outfit
it
for
deep
space
travel
and
take
his
family
with
him
on
his
further
voyages
of
exploration
and
survey
they
were
now
en
route
to
a
new
portion
of
the
galaxy
one
never
so
far
as
they
knew
visited
by
human
beings
but
what
we
do
without
pop
jon
mind
went
back
to
his
problem
who
would
be
in
command
of
their
ship
now
mom
did
know
a
thing
about
the
navigation
of
space
look
how
she
demanded
he
turn
around
now
she
was
wonderful
and
jon
loved
her
dearly
but
he
also
knew
she
would
be
absolutely
out
of
place
trying
to
make
their
decisions
about
where
to
go
how
to
get
there
how
to
run
the
ship
and
so
on
she
had
always
seemed
content
to
keep
house
on
the
ship
just
as
she
had
on
terra
and
paid
but
little
attention
to
what
else
was
going
on
and
jak
was
just
about
as
bad
the
older
boy
was
thinking
and
knew
a
lot
but
not
about
such
things
jon
had
been
the
one
who
was
always
tagging
their
father
around
forever
asking
questions
about
how
to
do
this
why
was
that
done
what
did
this
machine
do
and
what
was
the
theory
behind
it
and
so
on
he
had
always
been
working
with
machines
almost
since
he
could
toddle
he
took
them
apart
not
destructively
but
questioningly
and
was
very
soon
able
to
put
back
together
again
correctly
an
endless
succession
of
mechanisms
recently
he
had
begun
the
study
of
astrogation
he
had
also
long
been
a
math
shark
and
now
knew
enough
to
realize
how
little
he
really
did
know
about
this
complicated
subject
although
actually
it
was
a
great
deal
sobered
and
suddenly
aware
of
a
growing
maturity
brought
on
by
the
terrific
problems
they
faced
jon
sat
up
he
rose
and
went
over
to
his
mother
side
he
touched
her
softly
on
the
shoulder
and
she
looked
up
at
him
at
sight
of
his
anxious
face
she
threw
her
arms
about
him
jon
boy
what
will
we
do
now
how
will
we
ever
manage
without
mr
c
at
this
echo
of
his
own
questionings
and
doubts
the
boy
straightened
we
make
out
all
right
mom
he
said
with
a
bravado
he
certainly
did
not
feel
but
which
he
hoped
she
would
think
was
genuine
have
to
make
up
our
minds
what
we
going
to
do
then
do
it
keep
on
with
pop
plans
of
course
this
was
a
statement
rather
than
a
question
why
why
she
seemed
startled
by
the
realization
that
she
had
to
make
a
decision
i
had
thought
about
that
yet
she
was
silent
a
moment
then
turned
to
her
elder
son
who
had
also
risen
and
was
listening
intently
what
do
you
think
jak
you
older
so
have
to
take
charge
now
and
be
the
man
of
the
family
the
slender
studious
looked
startled
i
i
know
he
stammered
his
eyes
suddenly
filled
with
strange
fears
i
i
suppose
we
might
as
well
go
home
we
do
know
where
going
or
what
we
were
to
do
when
we
got
there
he
suddenly
looked
like
a
little
boy
who
has
lost
everything
and
everyone
in
whom
he
had
looked
for
and
found
comfort
and
security
do
ask
me
mother
i
do
know
what
we
going
to
do
we
apt
to
die
without
father
to
keep
us
going
safely
jon
stared
at
him
this
brother
he
had
always
loved
and
to
whom
he
had
looked
up
as
a
strong
elder
companion
in
spite
of
their
almost
continuous
although
friendly
bickerings
which
never
disturbed
the
warm
affection
underneath
now
he
just
could
believe
his
eyes
and
ears
this
could
be
jak
the
strong
reliable
jak
suddenly
he
felt
a
surge
of
anger
and
distrust
yet
immediately
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
for
such
feelings
this
was
any
minnow
of
a
predicament
they
were
in
it
was
a
very
whale
of
a
mess
he
was
scared
himself
and
could
understand
just
how
jak
must
feel
but
by
the
great
horned
catfish
he
was
going
to
let
himself
cry
about
it
any
more
especially
in
front
of
mom
something
had
to
be
done
and
it
would
be
done
a
thought
flashed
through
his
mind
and
he
straightened
with
resolve
up
he
yelled
at
his
brother
and
when
jak
and
their
mother
stared
at
him
in
amazement
jon
grinned
calmly
and
said
half
apologetically
just
trying
to
snap
you
out
of
the
dumps
i
say
got
to
think
this
out
carefully
and
not
make
any
snap
decisions
or
give
up
like
this
the
ship
on
automatic
drive
and
decelerating
so
we
do
have
to
worry
about
running
it
for
some
time
but
pop
like
it
if
we
did
keep
on
you
know
how
important
this
trip
is
to
him
besides
he
be
waking
up
soon
and
even
if
he
has
to
stay
in
his
bunk
he
can
tell
us
what
to
do
do
you
know
where
we
going
and
why
jak
was
still
upset
sure
pop
talked
with
me
a
lot
about
it
their
mother
looked
from
one
to
the
other
doubtfully
then
smiled
in
a
constrained
manner
you
you
probably
right
jon
did
say
this
would
make
or
break
us
i
leave
it
up
to
my
two
big
boys
to
discuss
and
suggest
plans
until
your
father
is
able
to
take
charge
again
with
an
effort
she
pulled
herself
together
and
now
her
smile
was
firmer
brighter
meanwhile
i
think
we
better
have
something
to
eat
we
have
to
keep
up
our
strength
for
whatever
is
coming
you
know
when
the
boys
woke
up
the
next
morning
their
mother
reported
that
their
father
had
apparently
had
a
restful
night
coming
out
of
his
coma
briefly
a
couple
of
times
after
breakfast
the
two
boys
went
into
the
control
room
and
began
examining
the
various
instruments
and
recorders
on
the
panel
to
see
if
they
could
figure
out
how
much
longer
it
would
take
them
to
reach
the
system
their
father
was
seeking
through
the
visiplates
they
could
now
see
not
only
the
sun
toward
which
jon
said
they
were
heading
but
even
its
nearer
planets
were
beginning
to
show
appreciable
discs
as
they
were
studying
these
jak
suddenly
asked
how
do
you
suppose
we
happened
to
run
into
a
meteor
way
out
here
in
space
like
that
jon
shook
his
head
helplessly
darned
if
i
can
figure
it
out
i
always
supposed
such
stuff
was
only
found
inside
a
planetary
system
must
be
there
some
in
deep
space
though
since
we
sure
as
perch
got
hit
by
one
he
reached
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
small
stone
here
it
is
i
hunted
around
and
found
it
last
night
it
dented
the
farther
bulkhead
but
must
have
lost
so
much
momentum
it
penetrate
just
one
of
those
chances
eh
jak
looked
up
from
his
examination
of
the
stone
yes
there
still
so
much
about
space
nobody
knows
yet
jak
thought
silently
for
a
moment
then
asked
well
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
next
keep
going
natch
jon
voice
was
earnest
we
ca
be
more
than
a
couple
of
days
away
from
the
nearest
planets
and
we
over
six
weeks
out
of
terra
pop
said
this
system
we
heading
for
has
four
or
five
planets
at
least
and
that
probably
two
and
three
and
maybe
four
would
be
fairly
earthlike
and
habitable
so
long
as
we
so
close
it
would
be
wrong
if
we
did
at
least
take
a
looksee
at
them
yes
slowly
father
want
us
to
do
that
you
know
darned
well
he
would
he
sunk
almost
everything
he
got
into
this
ship
and
this
trip
and
if
we
miss
now
the
government
probably
would
give
us
another
exclusive
crack
at
it
even
if
we
could
scrape
up
the
credits
to
come
out
here
again
did
father
say
something
the
other
day
about
his
you
know
showing
there
was
yes
popped
up
strong
on
that
and
that
another
reason
got
to
keep
going
especially
since
you
think
pop
snap
out
of
it
in
a
few
days
you
sure
of
that
are
you
he
peered
intently
into
his
brother
eyes
yes
as
far
as
i
can
tell
there
a
concussion
where
his
head
hit
the
floor
but
i
do
think
it
too
bad
and
it
should
wear
off
soon
jon
sighed
with
relief
if
if
he
was
dead
or
dying
it
would
be
different
and
i
say
go
home
but
there
another
thing
before
we
left
terra
we
heard
a
rumor
slik
bogin
was
chasing
around
out
in
this
sector
and
we
do
want
to
let
him
beat
us
to
this
system
bogin
that
the
notorious
pirate
is
it
no
if
he
out
here
we
do
want
to
let
him
beat
us
though
what
we
could
do
if
he
did
try
i
do
know
we
figure
that
out
if
he
tries
to
hijack
us
you
hope
there
was
a
long
silence
while
the
boys
studied
their
instruments
again
then
what
about
landing
chubby
can
you
do
it
i
been
studying
up
on
it
put
on
the
last
night
jon
was
suddenly
with
the
prospect
but
determined
to
keep
his
voice
level
i
helped
pop
land
the
crate
several
times
even
handled
the
controls
under
his
instructions
so
i
think
i
can
do
it
with
you
reading
off
the
manual
to
me
anyway
if
if
pop
gets
worse
we
got
to
land
some
time
so
we
might
as
well
try
it
here
as
any
time
or
anywhere
jak
stood
silent
a
long
moment
rubbing
his
hand
through
his
hair
as
he
did
when
concentrating
then
he
looked
up
with
determination
jon
you
and
i
have
got
ourselves
a
job
to
do
and
now
his
voice
was
steady
and
earnest
it
up
to
us
to
take
care
of
mother
and
keep
her
from
worrying
so
whenever
we
where
she
can
hear
us
we
got
to
act
brave
and
sure
of
ourselves
no
matter
how
we
feel
inside
yes
she
all
broken
up
about
pop
we
ought
to
do
most
of
the
work
too
so
she
no
jak
shook
his
head
that
be
the
worst
thing
we
could
do
she
is
sick
physically
and
if
she
keeps
busy
she
wo
have
time
to
worry
so
much
so
we
must
keep
her
from
having
too
much
idle
time
oh
maybe
you
right
owl
yes
guess
you
are
at
that
more
your
dish
but
we
can
act
like
everything
going
to
jet
fair
it
a
deal
he
held
out
his
hand
and
the
two
brothers
clasped
in
agreement
they
went
into
the
living
quarters
hi
mom
lunch
ready
yet
starved
as
usual
jak
bantered
mrs
carver
looked
up
apathetically
from
the
recline
seat
where
she
had
been
sitting
worrying
during
the
several
hours
the
boys
had
been
in
the
control
room
she
looked
as
though
she
were
almost
shocked
at
their
seemingly
heartless
question
forgetting
that
she
herself
had
used
the
same
excuse
the
night
before
but
in
a
moment
she
smiled
tremulously
i
guess
i
let
myself
forget
my
job
and
that
we
have
to
go
through
the
motions
of
living
she
rose
slowly
and
the
boys
came
and
put
their
arms
about
her
would
want
me
to
break
down
like
this
i
try
to
do
better
she
gave
her
sons
a
quick
hug
and
went
into
the
little
galley
where
they
heard
her
moving
about
from
the
to
cupboards
to
soon
the
smells
of
appetizing
food
spread
throughout
the
ship
jon
had
gone
back
into
the
control
room
and
picked
up
the
reelbook
on
astrogation
opening
it
to
the
chart
of
the
pilot
panel
he
was
still
studying
this
and
tracing
from
the
diagrams
in
the
book
the
controls
switches
and
recorders
on
the
panel
itself
he
memorized
each
one
as
he
went
along
and
made
sure
he
knew
its
functions
when
jak
called
him
to
lunch
jon
carried
the
reel
with
him
and
continued
studying
it
as
he
absentmindedly
ate
his
preoccupation
with
it
raised
his
mother
fears
again
can
you
make
anything
out
of
it
son
huh
he
roused
himself
then
and
grinned
at
her
sure
mom
easy
pop
taught
me
most
of
it
already
and
i
just
refreshing
my
mind
i
set
us
down
in
one
piece
do
you
fear
how
soon
will
we
arrive
about
tomorrow
noon
i
think
by
our
clocks
no
telling
what
time
it
be
there
i
take
measurements
again
and
make
sure
right
after
i
through
eating
we
must
be
about
ready
to
step
up
our
deceleration
he
looked
at
his
mother
more
intently
and
his
voice
was
so
earnest
it
broke
from
baritone
to
a
childish
treble
in
places
mom
i
not
questioning
your
authority
or
anything
but
you
said
yesterday
that
jak
was
to
be
in
charge
until
pop
wakes
up
now
jak
does
know
anything
at
all
about
astrogation
and
while
i
do
know
it
all
i
do
know
more
than
he
does
and
i
have
to
handle
it
so
what
about
me
being
in
charge
of
the
ship
when
we
in
flight
or
on
landings
and
and
jak
in
charge
other
times
though
whatever
you
say
goes
of
course
he
added
hastily
somewhat
to
his
surprise
his
brother
sided
with
him
the
elder
seemed
to
realize
this
was
no
time
for
one
of
their
friendly
squabbles
about
which
was
to
be
top
man
that
their
very
safety
depended
on
the
fact
that
whichever
knew
the
most
about
any
one
thing
should
be
the
one
to
have
the
say
about
it
their
mother
looked
from
one
to
the
other
helplessly
i
i
guess
that
will
be
all
right
you
two
figure
out
things
between
you
all
the
men
i
have
now
until
your
father
she
almost
broke
into
tears
then
but
pulled
herself
together
yes
you
do
whatever
you
think
is
best
about
such
things
we
handle
it
jak
assured
her
but
you
still
be
boss
in
chief
you
say
and
and
jak
and
i
figure
out
jon
grinned
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
grasped
each
by
a
hand
my
big
boys
i
sure
we
come
through
safely
you
getting
to
be
real
men
then
she
changed
her
tone
and
asked
you
going
to
land
on
one
of
those
planets
then
as
c
planned
being
so
close
it
seems
best
jak
answered
how
long
we
stay
will
depend
on
what
we
do
or
do
find
there
yes
we
need
a
few
days
rest
on
firm
ground
before
we
start
back
to
terra
at
least
we
want
to
freshen
our
air
if
we
can
and
maybe
get
some
fresh
food
besides
we
ought
to
try
to
get
all
the
necessary
data
to
prove
pop
discovery
if
the
planets
are
uninhabited
but
worth
colonizing
i
agree
seconded
jak
even
if
we
have
to
land
in
some
secluded
spot
and
just
rest
i
leave
it
up
to
you
then
their
mother
appeared
more
like
her
usual
happy
self
than
the
boys
had
seen
her
since
the
accident
keep
house
like
i
always
have
and
you
boys
do
whatever
else
you
think
best
jak
laughed
we
be
like
those
musketeers
in
that
old
book
i
read
some
time
ago
for
one
and
one
for
all
he
held
out
his
hand
dramatically
put
your
hands
on
mine
and
we
all
swear
to
it
laughing
they
did
as
he
suggested
although
their
mother
pretended
severity
you
know
i
do
like
swearing
boys
jak
grinned
but
i
meant
this
in
the
sense
of
an
oath
not
of
oh
she
krinkled
her
nose
at
him
grinning
with
her
impishness
that
different
jon
rose
from
the
table
i
get
back
to
my
studying
you
listen
to
your
mother
and
do
study
too
hard
she
warned
knowing
how
he
was
apt
to
lose
himself
in
his
books
you
need
plenty
of
rest
for
tomorrow
all
right
mom
but
when
she
went
into
the
control
room
long
after
dinner
he
was
still
deep
in
his
reelbook
she
took
it
away
from
him
get
to
bed
jon
you
promised
i
sorry
mom
just
got
so
interested
i
forgot
time
he
kissed
her
mom
and
do
worry
we
make
out
swell
i
sure
of
it
her
words
were
brave
but
he
could
see
the
tears
were
perilously
close
you
better
ask
jak
for
some
barbit
or
you
wo
sleep
any
better
than
you
did
last
night
he
counseled
remember
he
and
i
are
going
to
take
turns
watching
pop
thank
you
son
good
night
he
touched
a
switch
and
the
glolights
dimmed
and
went
dark
as
he
followed
her
out
all
the
next
morning
mrs
carver
and
her
two
sons
were
in
the
control
room
except
for
their
frequent
trips
to
mr
carver
bunk
to
see
how
their
patient
was
getting
along
they
were
studying
through
the
telescopic
visiplates
the
solar
system
they
were
rapidly
approaching
jon
had
figured
the
sun
was
a
type
g
dwarf
much
like
sol
but
a
little
larger
it
had
they
now
knew
only
five
planets
three
of
these
two
three
and
four
had
seven
satellites
among
them
from
their
distances
from
the
sun
the
boys
figured
that
probably
two
and
three
would
have
climates
that
human
colonists
with
some
adaptation
could
stand
now
they
were
peering
even
more
closely
into
their
plates
as
their
ship
circled
the
globe
beneath
them
jon
had
maneuvered
it
into
a
spiral
course
about
planet
two
in
such
a
manner
that
from
a
height
of
about
a
hundred
miles
they
could
get
a
good
view
of
the
world
beneath
them
in
their
telescopic
plates
lots
of
plant
life
but
i
have
seen
anything
that
looks
like
cities
jak
said
at
last
nor
i
from
their
mother
and
me
neither
jon
added
their
first
measurements
of
this
new
planet
had
shown
it
to
be
almost
the
size
of
terra
and
they
had
been
delighted
to
see
that
there
was
a
moon
of
considerable
size
although
not
as
large
as
luna
it
was
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
miles
out
there
a
number
of
large
seas
or
oceans
jak
commented
without
taking
his
eyes
from
his
visiplate
look
at
that
plant
life
though
it
evidently
coats
the
whole
planet
from
here
it
looks
like
jungle
lots
of
lakes
and
rivers
on
it
and
in
those
plains
we
saw
jon
was
excited
it
sure
looks
like
a
wonderful
world
where
men
can
live
as
they
crisscrossed
the
planet
from
pole
to
pole
they
saw
small
ice
fields
about
each
that
means
there
be
varied
seasons
here
jon
stated
not
necessarily
jak
argued
in
fact
while
possible
it
not
even
probable
says
you
jon
sniffed
then
later
i
figure
the
year
here
at
about
three
hundred
days
just
an
approximation
of
course
but
probably
within
five
per
cent
i
not
too
good
at
such
things
you
probably
wrong
jak
snorted
and
their
mother
interrupted
what
she
thought
was
the
beginning
of
another
of
their
interminable
arguments
are
you
going
to
land
here
or
go
on
to
another
planet
first
she
asked
jon
i
going
low
enough
to
test
atmosphere
and
temperature
before
i
decide
he
told
her
well
resignedly
do
as
you
boys
think
best
jon
manipulated
his
controls
and
as
the
ship
tilted
slightly
they
could
see
in
their
plates
the
ground
coming
closer
slowly
under
the
increased
reaction
of
the
powerful
bow
tubes
the
ship
slowed
until
it
was
cruising
at
about
one
thousand
miles
an
hour
and
about
a
mile
above
the
surface
or
the
tops
of
the
vegetation
at
least
then
jon
leveled
it
off
you
know
how
to
test
atmosphere
jak
he
asked
the
temp
now
is
about
degrees
fahrenheit
so
it
probably
is
over
at
ground
level
yes
father
taught
me
that
jak
moved
over
to
the
hull
wall
where
there
was
an
and
the
mechanism
that
tested
and
recorded
the
contents
of
any
air
they
might
encounter
on
a
new
planet
he
worked
this
and
studied
the
results
this
latest
invention
of
terran
aeroscopic
technies
was
simple
to
operate
a
chart
already
prepared
to
show
the
constituents
of
atmospheric
limits
compatible
to
human
needs
was
placed
beneath
a
stylus
the
latter
drew
a
curve
showing
the
components
of
the
new
air
and
if
the
lines
did
not
go
above
or
below
the
red
one
on
the
prepared
chart
the
atmosphere
was
safe
for
human
consumption
carbon
dioxide
a
little
higher
and
when
i
tested
density
with
a
spring
balance
the
weight
showed
nine
and
a
half
jak
reported
that
means
we
feel
a
trifle
lighter
and
wo
find
walking
and
lifting
as
hard
their
mother
had
been
hovering
nervously
in
the
background
now
she
stepped
up
and
asked
are
you
sure
it
is
safe
here
we
will
be
before
we
go
outside
mother
jak
assured
her
then
turned
to
jon
where
are
you
going
to
land
soon
as
i
find
a
good
spot
keep
your
eyes
peeled
for
a
large
clearing
but
they
had
gone
only
a
few
more
miles
when
jak
yelled
there
jon
off
to
the
left
a
mile
or
so
at
his
first
words
jon
had
increased
the
negative
acceleration
his
darting
eyes
spotted
the
clearing
and
he
put
the
ship
into
a
circle
and
elevated
the
nose
so
they
climbed
to
a
height
of
some
twenty
miles
grab
that
astrogation
book
and
get
ready
to
read
me
the
checks
owl
mom
you
strap
in
is
pop
all
right
mrs
carver
assured
him
that
on
her
recent
trip
to
her
husband
bunk
she
had
seen
to
it
that
he
was
safely
fastened
down
in
anticipation
of
their
landing
jak
picked
up
the
book
and
opened
it
to
the
page
he
sank
into
the
seat
and
fastened
the
safety
belt
ready
when
you
are
their
mother
now
reported
all
fast
jon
a
moment
while
the
younger
boy
glanced
quickly
at
his
various
dials
then
he
said

a

per

let
her
down
anxious
seconds
of
jockeying
jon
eyes
flashing
from
indicator
to
gauge
to
telltale
to
screen
his
hands
and
feet
moving
here
and
there
on
the
controls
the
two
others
gasped
as
they
saw
the
ground
rushing
toward
them
so
swiftly
the
ship
landed
but
with
a
jar
that
shook
them
all
off
bow
retarders
jak
yelled
the
roar
of
the
tubes
ceased
and
they
were
almost
stunned
by
the
sudden
silence
down
landing
props
the
grind
of
a
motor
then
a
gentle
jar
and
the
ship
seemed
to
straighten
a
bit
props
down
close

closed
shut
off

shut
all

in

jon
hands
flashed
over
several
levers
knobs
and
switches
everything
neutral
he
turned
in
his
seat
then
and
his
face
wore
a
wide
grin
of
triumph
we
did
it
we
down
he
noticed
his
mother
white
strained
face
and
called
to
her
relax
mom
i
set
you
down
in
one
piece
just
as
i
said
i
would
jak
broke
in
with
a
scoffing
comment
although
his
eyes
showed
the
secret
pride
he
felt
in
his
younger
brother
ability
lousy
landing
what
the
big
idea
jolting
us
all
like
that
want
to
bust
up
the
ship
now
boys
their
mother
hastened
to
break
up
this
incipient
quarrel
before
it
had
the
chance
to
get
started
which
was
exactly
what
jak
intended
i
think
jon
did
exceptionally
well
considering
it
was
his
first
solo
landing
i
not
hurt
at
all
and
i
sure
the
ship
is
either
jak
pretended
to
look
ashamed
although
neither
of
the
boys
could
completely
hide
their
grins
and
had
to
face
away
from
her
yes
i
was
just
steaming
off
it
was
really
a
swell
job
chubby
but
jon
had
already
pushed
out
of
his
seat
and
was
at
one
of
the
peering
eagerly
outside
however
he
did
fling
back
over
his
shoulder
you
helped
a
lot
owl
could
have
done
it
without
you
the
other
two
came
up
quickly
to
stand
beside
him
staring
at
this
strange
new
world
the
clearing
in
which
the
ship
rested
they
could
see
now
was
about
a
hundred
acres
in
extent
near
the
ship
the
strange
grass
with
which
the
clearing
was
carpeted
was
seared
and
black
from
their
landing
blasts
and
burning
in
places
but
toward
the
huge
trees
that
walled
the
clearing
the
grass
was
in
its
natural
green
state
covered
with
tiny
whitish
blossoms
the
trees
visible
from
the
ship
were
mostly
very
tall
averaging
well
over
three
hundred
feet
the
carvers
estimated
they
looked
somewhat
like
douglas
firs
but
with
a
difference
the
terrans
could
not
at
the
moment
figure
out
the
three
could
see
no
animal
or
bird
life
but
guessed
this
did
not
mean
there
was
none
the
jungle
might
be
teeming
with
life
but
it
would
probably
have
been
frightened
away
for
the
time
being
by
this
strange
monster
that
had
descended
from
the
skies
to
land
on
their
world
think
it
safe
to
go
out
jak
asked
now
you
listen
to
your
mother
and
do
take
any
chances
we
wo
jon
told
her
then
answered
his
brother
we
wait
an
hour
and
see
what
we
can
see
from
here
then
decide
i
sure
want
a
closer
look
at
that
plant
life
jak
eyes
glistened
and
he
ran
to
get
his
binoculars
to
see
better
i
ought
to
examine
the
hull
and
tubes
too
to
make
sure
they
fouled
or
corroded
jon
told
his
mother
it
nearly
time
for
lunch
she
turned
away
at
least
you
must
stay
in
until
after
that
it
was
plain
she
was
still
worried
and
the
boys
tried
to
reassure
her
and
quiet
her
fears
when
she
called
they
reluctantly
left
their
vantage
points
at
the
ports
and
went
in
to
eat
the
lunch
she
had
prepared
several
times
she
had
to
caution
them
against
bolting
their
food
as
they
talked
eagerly
of
what
they
might
find
here
finally
finished
jon
rose
come
on
owl
he
urged
let
go
outside
and
give
it
the
lightly
better
break
out
our
rifles
first
the
elder
advised
no
telling
what
we
run
into
if
it
dangerous
enough
for
guns
i
wish
you
would
go
their
mother
was
worried
again
they
just
a
precaution
same
as
father
would
take
if
he
was
in
charge
jak
soothed
we
wo
go
out
of
this
clearing
this
first
time
you
better
give
another
feeding
first
had
you
jak
consulted
his
yes
it
nearly
time
and
we
might
not
be
back
by
the
regular
hour
the
problem
of
keeping
their
father
fed
and
in
good
health
apart
from
his
head
and
leg
injuries
had
not
proven
too
hard
when
they
became
convinced
that
he
was
not
going
to
wake
up
often
enough
to
eat
normally
jak
while
working
as
orderly
in
the
centropolitan
hospital
the
previous
summer
had
assisted
the
interns
and
nurses
in
giving
intravenous
feedings
to
unconscious
patients
so
he
knew
the
general
procedure
as
well
as
the
composition
and
quantity
of
the
nutrient
liquid
to
be
administered
will
you
come
help
me
mother
he
had
asked
when
he
was
sure
he
was
ready
for
that
first
feeding
we
got
to
find
certain
things
in
our
food
stores
you
sure
you
know
how
to
do
it
yes
it
not
hard
we
need
liquid
proteins
salt
sugar
and
glucose
with
his
mother
helping
he
had
gathered
these
from
their
stores
and
taken
them
into
the
galley
there
he
had
carefully
measured
out
and
mixed
these
ingredients
in
the
proportions
his
books
stated
then
he
and
jon
had
gone
into
the
workshop
and
there
the
younger
under
his
brother
supervision
and
with
pictures
of
the
apparatus
as
a
guide
had
rigged
up
a
to
go
into
the
mouth
of
a
large
bottle
to
this
they
had
attached
a
long
slender
plastic
tube
and
to
the
far
end
of
that
a
large
hollow
feeding
needle
as
the
others
watched
anxiously
jak
had
inserted
the
needle
into
the
large
vein
on
the
inside
of
his
father
left
elbow
with
his
thumb
jak
had
softly
rubbed
the
vein
just
above
the
needle
point
to
assist
the
flow
of
the
nutrient
soon
it
was
done
mr
carver
had
stirred
and
his
eyelids
had
fluttered
when
the
needle
was
inserted
but
he
had
not
fully
regained
consciousness
that
first
feeding
so
successfully
accomplished
mrs
carver
did
not
seem
to
worry
quite
so
much
about
her
husband
although
she
was
careful
to
keep
track
of
the
feeding
times
and
to
remind
her
sometimes
forgetful
son
of
his
duty
the
feeding
given
this
day
the
boys
consulted
together
shall
we
wear
our
spacesuits
jon
asked
i
do
see
why
it
hot
outside
but
bearable
and
the
air
all
right
jak
answered
positively
i
not
only
tested
it
but
i
breathed
the
sample
i
took
in
through
the
trap
it
smells
good
and
hurt
me
any
we
take
our
guns
and
i
want
my
magnifying
glass
and
knapsack
for
specimens
and
i
put
some
multiform
tools
in
my
belt
then
in
case
anything
that
needs
doing
on
the
tubes
or
hull
i
can
do
it
quickly
the
two
brothers
assembled
their
gear
and
jon
was
just
reaching
for
the
button
to
open
the
inner
door
when
they
stopped
short
and
shrank
back
for
a
terrific
roar
came
from
outside
such
a
tremendous
sound
it
penetrated
even
the
hull
of
their
ship
at
that
horrid
noise
the
two
boys
stood
frozen
a
moment
then
with
one
accord
raced
to
the
control
room
where
they
peered
out
of
the
quartzite
ports
great
whales
look
at
that
thing
jon
shouted
as
they
caught
their
first
glimpse
outside
yeow
jak
yelled
in
amazement
what
do
you
suppose
it
is
never
saw
anything
like
it
before
they
stared
in
awe
at
the
tremendous
creature
standing
in
the
little
clearing
looking
belligerently
toward
their
ship
it
was
so
unlike
any
earth
beast
it
was
no
wonder
the
boys
were
startled
the
huge
body
was
covered
with
heavily
matted
fur
it
must
have
been
at
least
a
dozen
feet
long
and
stood
about
eight
feet
tall
but
the
striking
thing
was
that
the
body
was
triangular
and
the
beast
was
two
at
the
back
and
one
in
front
there
was
no
tail
and
the
blocky
legs
one
at
each
corner
of
the
weirdly
triangular
body
seemed
to
end
in
clawed
feet
the
head
was
shaped
something
like
that
of
a
horse
but
the
huge
mouth
now
partly
open
was
seen
to
contain
great
fangs
larger
than
those
of
any
beast
the
boys
had
ever
seen
in
terran
zoos
or
on
any
planet
they
had
visited
two
of
the
tusks
were
almost
like
the
ones
they
had
seen
in
pictures
of
ancient
tigers
the
whole
getup
gave
such
an
effect
of
fierceness
that
both
boys
felt
a
shiver
run
down
their
spines
jak
voice
was
tremulous
as
he
spoke
yipe
i
sure
glad
i
not
out
there
with
that
jon
was
slow
in
answering
yet
if
we
going
out
at
all
he
hesitated
then
continued
we
either
have
to
chase
it
away
or
kill
it
if
we
can
his
brother
retorted
i
think
our
guns
handle
it
jon
said
the
question
is
how
are
we
going
to
do
it
without
exposing
ourselves
jak
thought
swiftly
maybe
we
could
open
the
outer
lock
door
a
crack
just
enough
to
see
through
and
aim
our
guns
yes
i
guess
that
it
do
say
anything
to
mother
jak
cautioned
of
course
not
silly
come
on
let
see
if
we
can
kill
it
the
two
ran
to
the
airlock
and
opened
the
inner
door
leaving
it
open
they
examined
their
guns
to
make
sure
they
were
fully
loaded
then
jon
punched
the
button
to
open
the
outer
lockdoor
it
was
possible
to
do
this
while
the
inner
one
was
still
open
since
there
was
now
air
outside
to
equalize
the
pressure
when
the
door
had
swung
open
a
couple
of
feet
jon
stopped
the
motor
and
joined
his
brother
who
was
peering
through
the
opening
the
huge
creature
was
still
facing
them
about
forty
yards
from
the
ship
one
of
its
rear
feet
was
now
pawing
at
the
ground
tearing
up
great
chunks
of
sod
while
it
roared
its
mighty
challenge
time
and
again
i
kneel
and
aim
for
the
left
eye
you
stand
over
me
and
try
to
hit
the
other
jak
took
swift
command
then
try
for
the
brain
or
heart
and
keep
pumping
while
our
ammo
lasts
or
until
we
kill
it
right
jon
took
his
place
and
aimed
his
gun
count
three
and
fire
together
jak
knelt
and
steadied
his
rifle
with
one
elbow
on
his
extended
knee
one
two
three
fire
as
the
two
shots
crashed
out
the
creature
sprang
into
the
air
a
couple
of
feet
a
great
scream
of
pain
and
rage
shook
the
very
ground
and
made
the
air
tremble
it
hesitated
only
a
moment
then
charged
toward
the
ship
at
terrific
speed
the
boys
pumped
shots
as
fast
as
they
could
both
had
hit
the
head
but
neither
had
put
out
an
eye
as
they
had
hoped
they
kept
firing
as
fast
as
they
could
work
their
guns
blood
spouted
from
numerous
wounds
on
the
beast
but
still
it
came
on
madly
with
swift
though
lumbering
bounds
back
quick
and
shut
the
door
jak
yelled
as
his
hammer
clicked
on
an
empty
gun
he
pushed
backward
and
scrambled
to
his
feet
as
jon
leaped
to
the
door
controls
the
heavy
door
swung
shut
and
the
boys
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
but
almost
at
once
their
eyes
filled
with
fear
they
cringed
back
when
they
felt
the
ship
itself
shudder
as
that
heavy
body
struck
against
it
as
swiftly
as
their
trembling
legs
would
carry
them
they
raced
back
to
the
control
room
they
reached
it
just
in
time
to
see
the
huge
triped
lunge
against
the
side
of
the
ship
a
second
time
and
again
held
their
breaths
as
it
did
so
once
more
the
beast
slow
mind
evidently
realized
then
that
it
could
not
so
easily
overthrow
this
strange
great
thing
that
had
appeared
so
mysteriously
in
its
jungle
clearing
it
backed
away
some
little
distance
still
roaring
out
in
that
horrible
voice
once
again
the
beast
bunched
its
mighty
muscles
for
another
attack
when
it
seemed
to
stop
in
the
middle
of
a
roar
it
wobbled
a
bit
slowly
its
mighty
legs
buckled
and
it
sprawled
on
the
ground
a
few
spasmodic
shudders
a
convulsive
shiver
that
ran
through
the
tremendous
frame
then
it
was
still
the
boys
let
out
their
breaths
they
were
just
beginning
to
congratulate
themselves
when
the
door
of
the
control
room
opened
and
their
mother
frightened
face
appeared
what
was
that
boys
i
was
taking
a
nap
but
your
shooting
woke
me
than
i
felt
the
ship
shake
as
though
there
was
an
earthquake
or
something
it
was
noth
jon
began
but
jak
went
up
to
her
and
put
his
arm
about
her
it
was
just
a
big
animal
mother
jon
and
i
killed
it
an
animal
big
enough
to
jar
the
ship
that
way
where
is
it
she
gasped
jak
pointed
silently
toward
the
port
and
she
hurried
to
look
out
at
sight
of
that
huge
mountain
of
flesh
she
cried
out
and
her
face
became
ever
more
white
and
strained
what
a
horrible
beast
are
you
sure
it
dead
quite
sure
it
was
hard
to
kill
jak
minimized
the
danger
and
made
himself
grin
encouragingly
i
going
out
and
hack
off
some
steaks
bet
they
be
good
too
you
do
no
such
thing
she
cried
shocked
now
you
boys
listen
to
your
mother
you
not
to
budge
outside
the
ship
i
want
you
to
leave
this
awful
world
at
once
the
two
boys
looked
at
their
mother
and
suddenly
they
seemed
to
feel
strength
and
maturity
growing
within
them
as
though
the
act
had
been
discussed
and
rehearsed
they
both
came
up
and
taking
their
mother
each
by
an
arm
led
her
out
of
the
control
room
and
back
to
their
living
quarters
there
they
sat
her
down
in
her
favorite
recline
seat
look
mother
you
know
how
much
we
both
love
you
and
want
to
obey
you
always
jak
said
earnestly
but
we
in
a
peculiar
situation
here
on
a
strange
planet
and
pop
out
of
commission
jon
broke
in
i
know
jon
and
i
are
still
boys
jak
continued
but
we
all
the
men
here
right
now
we
think
you
got
to
begin
trusting
us
to
make
the
decisions
jak
right
jon
chimed
in
we
not
going
to
take
any
fool
chances
but
i
say
we
got
to
go
ahead
and
do
things
just
as
we
think
pop
would
if
he
was
well
and
in
command
as
best
we
can
that
is
mrs
carver
looked
from
one
son
to
the
other
doubtfully
for
a
long
minute
then
smiled
tremulously
i
keep
forgetting
you
not
my
babies
any
longer
she
said
slowly
mothers
do
that
you
know
you
both
almost
grown
men
i
know
you
have
good
minds
almost
mature
minds
the
various
things
you
been
through
have
done
that
so
i
release
you
from
my
apron
strings
you
two
take
charge
and
do
whatever
you
feel
necessary
they
threw
themselves
on
their
knees
one
on
either
side
of
her
their
arms
about
her
oh
mother
we
did
mean
it
like
that
we
never
felt
you
had
us
tied
to
your
apron
strings
mom
jon
added
we
still
want
to
be
your
boys
even
though
we
do
have
to
act
like
men
at
least
until
pop
takes
charge
again
her
smile
now
was
warm
and
tender
all
hesitancy
and
most
of
the
fears
gone
and
i
have
tried
to
make
you
and
resourceful
and
he
be
as
proud
of
you
as
i
am
you
right
you
are
the
men
of
the
party
and
must
do
whatever
you
decide
should
be
done
but
be
careful
she
could
not
help
adding
we
will
mother
we
think
just
as
much
of
us
as
you
do
jon
quipped
they
left
her
sitting
there
then
and
went
back
to
the
control
room
as
they
came
close
to
the
they
peered
through
eagerly
and
were
surprised
to
see
the
huge
carcass
of
the
triped
literally
covered
with
strange
looking
winged
featherless
but
the
latter
had
large
sharp
beaks
with
which
they
were
tearing
great
gobs
of
flesh
from
the
hulk
gulping
them
down
with
ravenous
relish
scavengers
jon
exclaimed
his
eyes
glued
to
the
scene
yes
there
go
our
steaks
jak
tone
was
so
lugubrious
that
jon
looked
up
and
laughed
i
had
hoped
for
some
fresh
meat
there
be
plenty
later
on
jon
consoled
his
brother
probably
this
one
would
been
too
tough
anyway
jak
suddenly
chuckled
yes
like
the
fox
said
the
grapes
were
probably
sour
they
grinned
companionably
at
each
other
then
turned
back
to
watch
through
the
port
again
so
numerous
and
so
voracious
were
the
scavenger
birds
that
within
a
few
minutes
they
had
even
that
mammoth
carcass
stripped
of
flesh
leaving
only
the
huge
bones
one
by
one
the
birds
then
flew
into
the
forest
the
last
ones
fighting
among
themselves
for
the
few
remaining
scraps
of
stringy
flesh
or
entrails
before
they
too
took
wing
shall
we
try
it
now
jak
asked
after
the
last
of
the
had
gone
might
as
well
we
sure
do
want
to
be
cooped
up
here
forever
they
went
back
to
the
airlock
again
making
sure
their
guns
were
reloaded
and
their
ammo
belts
filled
when
both
boys
were
in
the
lock
jon
punched
the
button
that
closed
the
inner
door
then
opened
the
outer
one
safer
for
mom
to
have
one
of
them
shut
he
exclaimed
the
two
stood
there
a
moment
looking
all
about
them
except
for
that
strange
pile
of
huge
bones
now
covered
thickly
with
some
sort
of
reddish
insects
the
clearing
seemed
empty
of
all
life
except
the
peculiar
grasses
jon
climbed
down
to
the
ground
and
jak
followed
closely
they
walked
a
short
distance
away
then
turned
and
looked
back
scanning
carefully
in
all
directions
to
make
sure
no
enemy
was
at
their
backs
let
go
over
and
study
that
jungle
a
bit
jak
suggested
when
they
were
sure
their
rear
was
not
apparently
menaced
jon
had
been
looking
at
the
remains
of
the
beast
i
like
to
try
to
salvage
those
tusks
he
said
and
with
jak
at
his
side
went
up
to
them
the
two
boys
managed
after
considerable
work
to
get
the
great
fangs
out
of
the
jaws
they
brushed
off
the
clinging
insects
then
ran
back
and
placed
the
tusks
inside
the
lock
thanks
owl
now
we
go
take
a
look
at
your
trees
then
i
want
to
examine
the
tubes
and
the
outside
of
the
ship
but
we
better
stick
together
at
least
this
first
time
so
i
sort
of
cover
you
then
when
you
had
a
looksee
we
go
back
and
you
keep
guard
while
i
see
what
shape
the
boat
in
right
let
get
going
once
past
the
seared
place
they
found
that
the
peculiar
grasses
were
as
stiff
as
wheat
stubble
the
were
knife
sharp
but
unable
to
penetrate
the
heavy
leather
boots
the
boys
wore
jak
stooped
to
examine
and
study
them
the
blossoms
all
seem
to
have
three
of
these
whitish
petals
he
said
as
he
rose
at
last
and
that
yellowish
bulb
in
the
center
will
be
the
seed
pod
when
they
started
on
again
they
found
walking
difficult
until
they
learned
the
trick
of
scuffling
along
without
trying
to
raise
their
feet
above
the
tops
of
the
grasses
each
step
then
it
was
easier
particularly
since
the
gravity
here
was
about
five
per
cent
less
than
that
of
terra
so
they
weighed
less
and
their
strength
consequently
seemed
greater
the
trees
were
closely
clustered
for
the
most
part
and
after
studying
them
for
some
time
jak
said
they
a
lot
like
some
of
the
pines
back
home
although
not
too
much
like
any
i
ever
saw
notice
how
there
no
limbs
until
you
get
up
thirty
feet
or
so
jon
asked
they
be
hard
to
climb
without
spurs
indeed
after
anyone
did
reach
the
first
low
limbs
he
would
not
be
in
much
better
shape
for
climbing
for
the
branches
were
ten
to
fifteen
feet
apart
all
the
way
up
do
see
any
fruits
though
maybe
we
just
not
where
any
fruit
trees
are
growing
jak
said
after
a
bit
yes
lots
of
woods
back
home
do
have
any
fruit
or
nut
trees
in
them
the
strange
grasses
grew
only
in
small
occasional
clusters
inside
the
forest
but
the
ground
was
so
deeply
covered
with
fallen
twigs
rotted
branches
and
the
leaves
of
previous
years
that
walking
was
extremely
difficult
almost
impossible
in
places
there
probably
trails
somewhere
that
triped
would
made
some
sort
of
path
he
sure
was
heavy
enough
and
if
this
was
part
of
his
regular
stamping
ground
he
undoubtedly
used
the
same
route
maybe
but
not
necessarily
he
might
been
attracted
by
our
descent
anyway
we
can
look
for
that
later
let
go
back
now
so
you
can
look
over
the
ship
while
it
still
light
we
should
be
ready
for
a
quick
if
we
run
into
anything
too
hot
to
handle
jon
looked
the
surprise
he
felt
this
sudden
responsibility
was
making
jak
more
practical
than
he
had
ever
been
before
just
the
same
as
it
was
making
him
after
all
it
was
to
be
expected
jon
knew
jak
had
an
excellent
mind
the
elder
brother
had
just
used
it
for
what
jon
had
previously
felt
were
unimportant
things
not
mechanics
math
or
such
practical
interests
but
the
way
jak
had
taken
care
of
pop
the
way
he
had
figured
out
how
to
feed
him
and
the
right
medicines
to
use
on
the
bruise
on
his
head
that
must
have
injured
pop
inside
and
had
known
how
to
set
his
leg
it
was
a
danged
good
thing
after
all
that
jak
had
spent
so
much
time
studying
those
other
subjects
maybe
mechanics
and
such
sciences
were
not
the
main
things
in
life
after
all
other
things
had
their
uses
too
now
the
two
went
back
to
the
ship
and
around
to
the
stern
there
while
jak
stayed
on
the
ground
on
guard
watching
in
all
directions
in
turn
for
any
possible
dangers
jon
surveyed
the
great
driving
tubes
he
climbed
the
metal
rungs
set
into
the
ship
for
that
purpose
so
he
could
reach
each
of
the
tubes
with
his
glotorch
he
studied
the
lining
of
each
tube
crawling
partially
inside
each
one
in
turn
finally
he
backed
out
of
the
last
one
and
down
to
the
ground
all
in
fine
shape
he
reported
happily
to
his
brother
ca
find
a
single
thin
spot
in
any
of
them
that
new
alloy
is
really
something
although
the
older
brother
did
not
know
too
much
about
such
things
he
felt
a
sudden
relief
at
this
report
for
he
felt
that
jon
did
know
and
he
had
real
confidence
in
him
he
had
long
realized
the
differences
in
their
temperaments
and
for
several
years
had
known
his
brother
was
almost
a
genius
in
the
mechanical
field
he
remembered
mentioning
this
matter
to
their
father
one
time
and
how
his
eyes
had
shone
with
pride
as
he
answered
jon
really
remarkable
some
day
if
he
keeps
on
like
this
he
going
to
be
known
all
over
the
galaxy
because
of
what
he
do
in
mechanics
nor
had
jak
been
jealous
at
this
high
praise
of
his
younger
brother
jon
just
a
kid
he
had
said
and
he
thoughtless
rather
than
conceited
but
sometimes
he
makes
me
so
darned
mad
his
father
laughed
yes
like
all
kids
he
hates
the
thought
of
letting
anyone
get
ahead
of
him
that
particularly
true
of
younger
brothers
they
feel
within
themselves
that
they
are
just
as
good
or
better
than
the
older
members
of
the
family
and
sometimes
ca
help
showing
it
jak
grinned
i
bust
him
one
yet
some
day
though
if
he
watch
out
but
he
knew
and
so
did
his
father
that
he
never
would
for
both
knew
the
real
love
that
existed
between
the
two
brothers
jak
realized
that
his
swiftly
growing
brother
now
several
inches
taller
and
many
pounds
heavier
than
he
had
a
terrific
mind
so
as
now
he
generally
respected
jon
ideas
and
shrugged
away
any
momentary
angers
when
jon
was
particularly
bossy
jak
followed
as
jon
walked
slowly
along
the
side
of
the
ship
giving
it
a
careful
survey
especially
toward
the
bottom
to
see
if
anything
on
the
lower
surfaces
appeared
wrong
i
climb
up
and
give
the
top
a
tomorrow
jon
said
as
they
went
ahead
the
was
really
a
it
was
feet
long
and
about
eighteen
feet
in
diameter
at
its
thickest
part
which
was
about
a
third
of
the
way
back
from
the
bow
the
front
of
the
ship
was
bluntly
rounded
and
contained
the
control
room
with
its
thick
quartzite
and
just
outside
that
room
the
four
tubes
which
jon
also
carefully
examined
when
the
boys
reached
them
just
aft
of
the
control
room
were
the
living
quarters
these
consisted
of
the
large
comfortable
living
room
and
two
small
but
compact
bunkrooms
the
the
kitchen
and
many
ingeniously
designed
closet
and
drawer
spaces
for
stowing
personal
belongings
clothing
and
supplies
beyond
these
were
the
storerooms
for
food
tools
and
other
supplies
and
equipment
the
stern
of
the
ship
was
devoted
to
the
storage
of
fuel
and
the
various
machines
that
drove
the
and
kept
it
a
world
while
in
space
here
were
the
refrigerators
and
heaters
the
and
the
generators
of
electricity
for
light
and
cooking
and
for
their
auxiliary
motors
such
as
the
ones
controlling
the
airlock
doors
and
pumps
in
the
lower
part
of
the
hull
under
their
living
and
control
rooms
and
storerooms
were
hydroponic
tanks
which
not
only
grew
vegetables
and
greens
for
their
table
but
which
furnished
oxygen
to
replace
that
unavoidably
lost
when
the
locks
were
opened
at
the
far
stem
were
the
driving
mechanisms
the
latter
were
the
latest
development
in
the
field
and
were
surprisingly
small
for
the
tremendous
work
they
did
even
jon
did
not
yet
fully
understand
how
they
operated
although
he
knew
how
to
run
them
he
did
know
they
took
copper
in
the
form
of
small
nuggets
and
utilized
the
tremendous
force
locked
within
their
atoms
as
the
propelling
medium
by
which
the
ship
operated
in
some
manner
these
nuggets
were
vaporized
inside
the
generators
into
which
they
were
automatically
fed
from
the
storage
bins
as
needed
the
regulating
the
speed
with
which
they
were
fed
into
the
generators
this
vaporized
copper
was
run
through
some
sort
of
a
modified
mechanism
where
the
of
its
atoms
was
liberated
that
indescribable
power
then
forced
its
vaporized
particles
out
through
the
tubes
using
the
newtonian
law
of
action
and
reaction
to
propel
the
ship
suddenly
jon
turned
to
his
brother
hey
i
just
happened
to
think
we
ought
to
rig
up
a
siren
or
something
so
mom
can
call
us
if
she
needs
us
when
we
away
from
the
ship
sounds
like
a
swell
idea
can
fix
sure
nothing
to
it
we
may
even
have
one
among
the
stores
if
not
it
just
a
diaphragm
inside
a
tube
oscillated
by
electricity
see
if
we
got
one
or
else
make
one
and
install
it
as
they
neared
the
entrance
to
the
ship
they
saw
their
mother
standing
in
the
opened
lock
getting
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
looking
about
the
clearing
with
an
interested
expression
jon
had
just
opened
his
mouth
to
call
to
her
when
suddenly
without
warning
without
even
a
change
in
the
light
or
feeling
in
the
air
rain
began
coming
down
in
great
sheets
the
boys
after
only
a
momentary
start
of
surprise
raced
for
the
airlock
their
mother
stayed
to
help
them
climb
in
but
by
the
time
they
were
inside
and
the
outer
door
was
closed
they
were
wet
through
to
the
skin
wow
that
sure
some
storm
wonder
if
it
a
regular
feature
here
i
would
know
jak
panted
did
you
get
a
look
at
that
lightning
and
hear
the
thunder
did
take
time
i
was
too
busy
running
jon
laughed
as
he
tried
to
wring
the
worst
of
the
water
out
of
his
coveralls
before
going
through
the
living
room
to
the
bunkroom
where
they
could
change
to
dry
garments
as
they
came
out
their
mother
now
also
in
dry
clothes
met
them
with
a
smile
i
think
your
father
is
getting
better
he
moved
about
quite
a
bit
a
while
ago
although
he
did
completely
regain
consciousness
wonderful
that
super
later
as
the
three
were
eating
dinner
jak
suddenly
laid
down
his
fork
in
excitement
just
happened
to
think
we
did
see
any
cities
here
so
does
that
make
this
a
prime
discovery
that
it
do
that
it
do
jon
said
delightedly
then
that
means
we
have
the
right
to
name
and
claim
this
system
unless
there
are
intelligent
inhabitants
on
some
of
the
other
planets
seems
to
me
if
there
were
any
they
be
here
this
is
certain
to
be
the
most
logical
world
to
support
life
what
we
call
this
system
of
course
stupid
after
pop
jon
answered
witheringly
that
very
thoughtful
of
you
son
his
mother
smiled
at
him
fondly
we
call
the
sun
then
and
the
five
planets
will
be
and
ouch
how
corny
can
you
get
jon
sniffed
since
there
are
five
i
know
the
fifth
should
be
named
for
the
ship
and
we
ca
very
well
call
it
rover
but
certainly
not
just
either
why
not
leave
off
the
last
and
just
call
it
their
mother
suggested
good
swell
the
two
exclaimed
at
once
that
means
this
one
is
named
after
you
mom
how
does
it
feel
to
have
a
whole
world
named
after
you
you
ought
to
know
she
retorted
with
a
smile
that
brought
out
her
dimples
in
the
old
way
you
each
got
one
named
for
you
then
let
call
this
moon
after
the
ancient
goddess
of
the
moon
jak
said
look
owl
this
is
mom
planet
she
has
the
right
to
name
her
own
moon
jon
voice
was
almost
a
sneer
i
think
is
a
very
nice
name
and
i
accept
that
although
i
going
to
make
it
his
mother
soothed
that
has
always
been
my
favorite
girl
name
if
i
ever
had
a
daughter
i
probably
would
have
named
her
so
it
will
make
a
doubly
fine
name
for
my
moon
have
time
to
measure
or
weigh
it
now
but
i
bet
it
big
enough
and
close
enough
to
cause
tides
jon
said
meditatively
what
that
got
to
do
with
the
price
of
onions
in
bermuda
nothing
just
thought
it
was
interesting
well
bed
for
me
need
a
good
rest
tonight
why
especially
son
what
do
you
plan
for
tomorrow
just
some
more
exploring
that
all
and
we
be
careful
jon
added
hastily
as
he
saw
the
familiar
words
forming
on
her
lips
mom
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
jon
suddenly
stopped
eating
say
as
we
were
coming
down
did
you
notice
a
small
river
or
creek
just
over
there
to
the
right
i
was
pretty
busy
at
the
time
but
seem
to
remember
something
of
the
sort
yes
there
was
one
near
but
do
know
just
how
far
why
the
boy
grinned
if
there
a
stream
there
probably
fish
i
was
thinking
we
could
get
some
fresh
supplies
that
way
you
and
your
fishing
do
you
ever
think
of
anything
else
sure
i
do
but
i
notice
you
always
eat
your
share
when
i
catch
any
and
mom
cooks
their
mother
said
quickly
some
fresh
fish
would
taste
good
boys
if
you
have
time
and
can
catch
any
i
know
we
would
all
appreciate
them
look
jak
you
want
to
explore
some
more
of
that
jungle
and
i
want
to
see
if
there
any
of
that
stuff
pop
was
looking
for
near
here
we
can
just
as
well
do
both
while
working
toward
that
creek
and
i
can
take
my
rod
along
but
first
we
got
to
set
up
our
marker
here
in
the
clearing
that
right
i
almost
forgotten
your
telling
us
about
that
and
we
do
want
to
stay
too
long
either
did
you
say
we
have
to
place
one
on
each
planet
in
order
to
prove
our
claim
as
original
discovers
yes
and
one
in
an
orbit
about
the
sun
too
jon
pushed
back
his
chair
and
rose
i
go
get
one
from
the
storeroom
i
get
my
specimen
cases
ready
and
see
to
the
guns
jak
too
rose
then
forestalled
his
mother
by
turning
to
her
i
feed
father
first
and
we
be
careful
outside
you
can
call
us
back
with
the
new
siren
jon
installed
if
you
need
us
all
right
boys
she
smiled
at
them
seemed
to
rest
well
last
night
although
i
do
wish
he
would
regain
full
consciousness
plenty
of
housekeeping
to
keep
busy
while
you
gone
really
should
do
some
washing
but
that
does
take
long
just
do
stay
out
too
late
we
wo
they
both
assured
her
we
be
back
long
before
dark
the
marker
which
jon
fetched
from
the
storeroom
and
placed
near
the
inner
lockdoor
ready
to
take
outside
and
set
up
was
one
developed
by
the
scientists
and
technies
of
terra
for
just
such
use
it
consisted
of
an
exceptionally
strong
broadcasting
unit
that
beamed
the
message
of
a
tape
continuously
toward
terra
jon
made
up
the
tape
while
jak
was
giving
the
feeding
it
read
this
planetary
system
was
first
discovered
by
tad
carver
on
fourteenth
january
this
is
the
second
planet
and
has
been
named
over
and
over
at
intervals
the
sender
would
broadcast
that
message
on
a
beam
aimed
at
terra
the
controlling
mechanism
was
a
marvelously
precise
uranium
clock
and
a
small
atomic
motor
with
fuel
enough
for
five
years
gave
all
the
needed
power
by
the
terms
of
the
terran
colonial
laws
this
was
supposed
to
entitle
the
prime
discover
to
certain
rights
in
the
system
for
one
thing
he
would
receive
a
per
cent
share
of
the
value
of
all
minerals
oils
jewels
and
certain
other
natural
resources
later
colonists
might
wrest
from
those
planets
for
twenty
years
following
his
discovery
and
the
acceptance
of
his
claim
in
this
way
the
colonial
board
of
the
world
government
of
terra
sponsored
and
assured
the
exploration
which
the
development
of
travel
had
made
possible
the
dangers
and
expense
were
so
considerable
that
something
well
worth
while
had
to
be
offered
to
make
individuals
or
companies
willing
to
gamble
on
the
hardships
and
tremendous
costs
of
exploration
when
the
boys
left
the
ship
to
place
the
marker
they
left
both
lockdoors
open
so
that
the
fresh
morning
air
from
outside
could
circulate
throughout
the
ship
replacing
the
somewhat
stuffy
although
chemically
pure
air
that
their
purifiers
kept
renewed
keep
your
eyes
and
ears
open
and
shut
the
doors
if
you
think
any
danger
both
boys
cautioned
their
mother
after
making
sure
she
knew
how
to
work
the
door
controls
i
will
she
promised
with
a
laugh
and
could
help
adding
just
you
be
as
careful
as
i
be
the
boys
carried
the
to
a
distant
corner
of
the
clearing
to
what
jon
said
was
a
good
spot
the
book
says
to
dig
a
hole
and
plant
it
with
the
top
projecting
three
inches
above
the
ground
whenever
such
a
thing
is
possible
you
know
what
to
do
so
take
charge
jak
said
simply
when
they
had
dug
the
hole
and
placed
the
sender
in
it
they
shoveled
the
dirt
back
then
jon
opened
the
lid
he
started
the
tape
reels
and
the
broadcasting
unit
then
carefully
shut
and
locked
the
cover
in
digging
they
found
the
ground
here
to
be
damp
and
soggy
apparently
from
that
terrific
downpour
of
the
previous
evening
it
was
almost
like
a
wet
clay
although
even
to
their
inexperienced
eyes
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
rich
type
of
soil
look
how
wet
it
is
even
over
two
feet
down
jon
said
that
was
a
real
rain
last
night
jak
shook
his
head
slowly
but
somehow
i
ca
believe
it
made
this
maybe
this
is
the
rainy
season
they
started
toward
the
jungle
but
turned
to
look
back
toward
the
ship
they
saw
their
mother
at
the
open
door
and
waved
to
her
after
seeing
her
answering
wave
they
plunged
into
the
forest
at
a
point
where
they
saw
a
trail
left
either
by
the
frequent
passings
of
the
great
triped
they
had
shot
or
by
other
beasts
of
some
type
not
yet
seen
memory
of
that
gigantic
beast
though
made
them
doubly
cautious
sure
do
want
to
meet
his
relatives
jon
said
especially
the
mate
jak
added
and
could
not
conceal
a
shiver
they
had
noticed
with
considerable
interest
and
surprise
that
those
native
scavengers
had
almost
entirely
eaten
the
bones
of
the
triped
apparently
we
not
find
much
in
the
way
of
remains
on
this
world
jak
commented
as
they
walked
carefully
along
the
trail
those
scavenger
birds
and
ants
sure
clean
up
things
in
a
hurry
except
for
old
vegetation
jon
grunted
as
he
stumbled
over
a
dead
branch
protruding
out
into
the
trail
he
was
keeping
his
rifle
ready
in
his
hands
and
his
keen
eyes
alert
to
one
side
and
then
the
other
rather
than
downward
knowing
his
younger
brother
was
so
carefully
on
guard
jak
felt
free
to
study
and
examine
the
various
trees
and
other
plant
life
near
the
irregular
path
they
were
following
he
was
almost
in
a
frenzy
of
delight
constantly
darting
off
the
trail
a
few
yards
to
look
at
some
specimen
he
had
detected
studying
it
carefully
and
exclaiming
over
his
find
hey
this
one
is
like
an
he
yelped
intently
studying
the
bark
with
his
magnifying
glass
spik
englis
jon
scolded
what
is
it
a
hard
maple
jak
voice
was
condescending
then
he
ran
over
to
another
this
one
almost
like
a
silver
poplar
see
how
its
light
bark
glints
where
the
sunlight
hits
it
he
started
toward
another
farther
away
but
jon
called
him
back
get
so
far
from
the
trail
reluctantly
jak
retraced
his
steps
only
to
be
off
again
a
moment
later
this
got
nuts
almost
like
small
coconuts
he
picked
a
fallen
one
from
the
ground
and
tossed
it
to
jon
see
if
you
can
crack
it
and
find
out
what
inside
but
when
jon
had
done
so
it
proved
to
be
dried
and
they
could
not
get
a
fresh
one
from
the
tree
by
shaking
and
it
was
too
smooth
and
high
to
climb
without
spurs
jak
quickly
filled
his
knapsacks
with
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
smaller
plants
twigs
and
leaves
he
was
continually
finding
soon
jon
was
laughing
heartily
for
his
brother
now
had
to
discard
an
older
specimen
to
make
room
for
the
new
you
have
to
make
several
trips
to
get
anywhere
near
all
of
those
just
around
here
owl
jon
called
at
last
you
ca
take
back
everything
anyway
way
you
going
now
you
soon
have
the
ship
so
full
of
your
junk
there
be
no
place
for
us
and
this
is
only
the
first
planet
remember
but
these
are
unique
jak
wailed
botanists
will
want
to
study
them
then
let
them
come
here
jon
stated
practically
jak
looked
at
him
and
grew
shamefaced
guess
i
did
go
a
little
nuts
he
said
but
before
long
his
excitement
rose
to
fever
pitch
again
there
so
much
here
that
new
and
different
yet
something
like
the
ones
we
know
i
must
take
back
samples
of
everything
how
many
different
kinds
of
oh
say
roses
are
there
on
terra
why
why
i
do
really
know
hundreds
i
sure
maybe
thousands
what
that
got
to
do
with
this
simply
trying
to
make
you
realize
you
ca
take
back
samples
of
as
you
said
ouch
jak
laughed
then
you
got
me
pal
i
take
it
easier
but
he
soon
forgot
his
good
intentions
as
he
found
ever
newer
and
more
different
plants
and
trees
and
mosses
there
was
such
a
dissimilarity
yet
at
the
same
time
so
many
points
of
likeness
between
the
plant
life
of
this
new
world
and
that
of
terra
that
the
young
botanist
was
in
a
continual
state
of
excitement
jon
meanwhile
although
still
keeping
a
sharp
watch
for
any
possible
dangers
had
been
noticing
the
profusion
of
other
life
in
this
jungle
there
were
a
number
of
different
bird
forms
although
he
saw
that
those
he
was
close
enough
to
examine
were
rather
than
feathered
nor
did
they
seem
to
be
songsters
for
the
only
noises
he
heard
were
the
soughing
of
the
wind
through
the
trees
and
vines
and
bushes
and
the
of
wings
as
the
birds
flew
past
they
had
gone
some
distance
when
he
stopped
short
off
at
one
side
there
was
movement
among
the
small
bushes
a
quick
sibilant
whisper
froze
jak
in
his
tracks
jon
raised
his
gun
his
eyes
searching
quickly
then
two
quick
shots
and
a
threshing
in
the
underbrush
soon
stillness
and
the
two
boys
advanced
cautiously
both
with
their
guns
at
the
ready
in
the
bushes
they
found
what
jon
had
shot
two
small
tripeds
somewhat
resembling
large
jack
rabbits
hah
these
should
be
good
eating
jon
was
in
transports
as
he
picked
them
up
examining
them
carefully
should
be
tender
at
least
if
the
flesh
is
suitable
to
us
jak
was
excited
too
there
enough
for
a
good
meal
jon
took
a
piece
of
cord
from
his
coverall
pocket
and
tied
the
hind
legs
together
then
slung
them
over
his
shoulder
let
keep
going
jak
continued
finding
new
and
different
plants
and
jon
kept
on
guard
once
they
saw
one
of
the
huge
tripeds
in
the
distance
and
stopped
instantly
being
very
quiet
as
they
slipped
behind
the
boles
of
large
trees
from
which
they
peered
out
cautiously
but
apparently
the
great
beast
had
not
heard
seen
nor
smelled
them
it
finally
wandered
away
grazing
well
i
be
a
tadpole
jon
exclaimed
a
but
jak
was
not
so
sure
lots
of
also
eat
a
little
grass
those
teeth
did
look
like
the
ones
of
a
herbivore
i
think
i
keep
away
from
them
anyway
you
and
me
both
jon
was
agreeable
to
the
idea
at
last
after
nearly
two
hours
the
two
boys
came
to
the
banks
of
the
stream
which
was
about
a
quarter
mile
wide
at
this
point
and
seemed
not
too
deep
at
least
near
the
shore
now
it
was
jon
turn
to
become
the
most
excited
he
ran
to
the
edge
and
peered
into
the
shallow
depths
then
called
out
delightedly
at
seeing
dozens
of
darting
forms
of
some
type
of
marine
life
in
the
clear
waters
you
watch
while
i
fish
he
commanded
dropping
his
gun
and
the
two
creatures
he
took
the
carrying
case
from
his
shoulder
opened
it
and
in
moments
had
his
rod
reel
and
line
ready
yippee
he
yelled
as
he
got
an
immediate
strike
on
his
first
cast
with
true
fisherman
skill
he
played
the
now
fighting
swiftly
darting
denizen
of
the
river
carefully
he
reeled
in
his
catch
giving
line
when
the
fish
ran
or
plunged
reeling
in
when
he
felt
the
least
bit
of
slack
exerting
only
enough
pressure
to
force
the
in
toward
him
without
losing
it
soon
the
wriggling
creature
was
in
shallow
water
and
jon
waded
out
with
his
landing
net
a
quick
darting
movement
with
hand
and
net
and
he
had
his
first
catch
he
took
it
carefully
from
the
net
and
held
it
aloft
examining
and
admiring
it
while
jak
danced
about
on
the
shore
near
him
uttering
shrill
yelps
of
triumph
they
could
see
that
jon
catch
was
streamlined
almost
like
a
trout
or
barracuda
it
was
nearly
fifteen
inches
long
and
very
slender
there
seemed
to
be
no
scales
the
skin
was
more
like
that
of
an
eel
or
bullhead
fish
or
snake
jak
asked
do
know
for
sure
jon
was
still
studying
it
think
it
a
fish
all
right
but
it
has
any
fins
and
swims
with
the
same
wriggles
a
snake
uses
i
think
it
more
eel
than
snake
though
and
i
quite
sure
it
be
good
eating
the
mouth
was
large
and
ran
back
almost
three
and
a
half
inches
when
jon
pried
it
open
to
remove
his
hook
he
saw
there
was
a
triple
row
of
teeth
so
quickly
took
a
pair
of
pliers
from
his
tool
belt
and
used
these
to
remove
the
deeply
swallowed
hook
the
freed
he
dropped
it
into
his
creel
then
cast
again
it
was
apparent
these
water
denizens
were
unused
to
lures
for
hardly
had
his
spinner
touched
the
surface
of
the
water
than
he
had
another
strike
as
swiftly
as
he
could
reel
in
and
remove
one
from
his
hook
and
cast
again
jon
brought
in
fish
after
fish
all
this
time
jak
was
dancing
about
now
as
excited
as
his
brother
at
this
prospect
of
fresh
food
to
replace
for
the
time
the
nourishing
but
concentrates
and
frozen
foods
on
which
they
had
been
living
for
so
long
but
when
jon
finally
was
satisfied
with
the
size
of
his
catch
he
found
that
leaving
the
river
was
not
to
be
a
simple
matter
of
wading
ashore
so
intent
had
he
been
on
his
fun
he
had
not
noticed
that
his
feet
were
sinking
further
and
further
into
the
bottom
only
now
as
he
tried
to
return
to
shore
did
he
find
he
could
not
lift
his
feet
they
were
firmly
embedded
in
the
sand
or
muck
more
than
halfway
to
his
knees
for
a
long
moment
he
struggled
to
pull
first
one
foot
and
then
the
other
from
the
clinging
stuff
then
he
realized
he
must
be
in
a
sort
of
quicksand
and
he
began
to
panic
quick
jak
come
help
me
i
caught
but
almost
instantly
he
countermanded
that
sharply
no
stay
back
the
bottom
here
quicksand
or
something
jak
had
come
running
at
jon
first
cry
at
this
warning
though
he
slid
to
a
halt
just
short
of
the
water
how
can
i
help
he
cried
anxiously
catch
these
first
and
jon
threw
first
his
rod
then
his
creel
filled
with
fish
jak
caught
each
and
tossed
them
farther
back
onto
the
bank
he
then
looked
quickly
about
and
spied
a
long
fallen
branch
at
some
little
distance
he
called
to
his
brother
who
was
still
trying
desperately
to
free
himself
hang
on
a
minute
i
be
right
back
racing
for
the
branch
he
picked
it
up
and
brought
it
back
to
the
water
edge
but
when
he
extended
it
toward
jon
it
was
too
short
by
several
feet
even
though
both
leaned
forward
jak
would
have
gone
into
the
water
with
it
but
jon
would
not
let
him
we
have
to
try
something
else
then
jak
was
getting
really
worried
now
for
he
could
see
that
the
water
was
up
to
jon
waist
you
have
to
make
it
snappy
jon
spoke
as
calmly
as
he
could
sinking
deeper
all
the
time
again
jak
searched
swiftly
and
purposefully
about
him
he
saw
something
he
thought
might
help
and
ran
swiftly
toward
one
of
the
smaller
trees
with
difficulty
because
of
the
scarcity
of
limbs
he
climbed
this
and
soon
was
hacking
with
his
knife
at
the
long
slender
liana
or
climbing
vine
that
hung
downward
from
it
it
took
only
a
few
moments
to
sever
the
top
end
then
jak
slid
down
the
trunk
and
traced
the
vine
to
its
root
cutting
it
there
with
this
long
section
he
ran
back
to
the
water
edge
catch
he
yelled
but
it
took
several
attempts
before
he
could
get
the
unwieldy
near
enough
for
jon
to
grasp
jak
dug
his
heels
into
the
ground
and
started
pulling
his
face
grew
red
cords
stood
out
in
his
neck
and
his
muscles
bulged
but
quickly
the
strain
proved
too
great
for
him
since
he
was
the
lighter
and
weaker
he
was
being
pulled
toward
the
water
rather
than
freeing
his
embedded
brother
i
ca
do
it
jak
panted
his
strength
gone
his
muscles
and
limbs
aching
and
trembling
tie
your
end
around
a
tree
i
try
to
work
myself
out
jak
did
so
and
the
muscles
on
jon
more
powerful
arms
back
and
shoulders
stood
out
in
ridges
as
he
threw
all
his
splendid
young
strength
into
this
climactic
effort
he
pulled
he
wriggled
about
from
side
to
side
slow
heartbreaking
moments
passed
as
the
tug
of
war
continued
inch
by
inch
jon
was
withdrawing
his
imprisoned
legs
from
the
sucking
gripping
stuff
that
was
so
determined
not
to
yield
its
victim
but
he
was
still
only
a
boy
and
he
had
neither
the
strength
nor
the
endurance
to
continue
for
long
this
tremendous
struggle
slowly
his
efforts
grew
weaker
and
less
successful
the
sand
began
reclaiming
that
which
it
had
lost
before
long
jon
sank
back
and
the
strain
on
the
vine
relaxed
ca
make
it
you
been
a
great
brother
he
tried
to
smile
take
care
of
mom
and
pop
and
break
it
to
them
gently
shut
up
you
dope
jak
yelled
but
there
was
a
catch
in
his
voice
we
not
licked
yet
desperately
his
mind
raced
he
must
think
of
some
more
effective
mode
of
leverage
if
only
he
knew
how
to
handle
the
ship
he
could
bring
that
here
and
with
the
loading
winch
in
the
lock
drag
his
brother
loose
but
that
was
out
he
did
know
how
to
handle
it
he
thought
of
going
after
his
mother
but
realized
quickly
that
before
he
got
her
and
brought
her
back
jon
would
be
gone
no
it
was
strictly
up
to
him
and
time
was
swiftly
running
out
jak
carver
eyes
searched
the
edge
of
the
jungle
feverishly
for
any
idea
for
some
means
of
rescuing
his
younger
brother
embedded
in
the
quicksand
of
the
stream
there
suddenly
he
spied
a
slim
but
tree
close
to
the
edge
and
a
trick
the
two
boys
had
often
played
with
a
small
tree
in
their
back
yard
at
home
sprang
into
his
mind
got
an
idea
jon
slack
off
a
minute
for
jon
had
been
trying
again
and
again
as
he
felt
a
momentary
return
of
part
of
his
strength
to
pull
himself
free
he
had
by
this
means
barely
managed
to
keep
from
sinking
further
but
that
was
all
now
with
a
quick
twist
jak
unfastened
the
end
of
the
liana
from
the
tree
to
which
he
had
tied
it
tie
your
end
about
you
just
under
the
arms
he
called
then
placing
his
end
of
the
vine
in
his
mouth
and
gripping
it
firmly
with
his
teeth
he
started
climbing
that
slim
tree
it
was
about
seven
inches
in
diameter
at
the
base
and
some
forty
to
feet
tall
his
brother
instantly
recognized
what
he
had
in
mind
so
as
jak
climbed
jon
made
sure
his
end
was
securely
fastened
about
him
then
he
grasped
the
vine
firmly
with
both
hands
a
few
inches
in
front
of
his
chest
as
jak
climbed
ever
higher
into
the
tree
the
slender
sapling
bent
beneath
his
weight
he
still
climbed
but
carefully
now
on
the
side
nearest
the
water
so
the
treetop
would
bend
in
that
direction
the
higher
he
climbed
the
tree
the
more
his
weight
made
it
curve
downward
so
that
toward
the
last
his
back
was
almost
parallel
to
the
ground
holding
with
his
legs
wrapped
about
the
trunk
when
he
was
almost
of
the
way
up
jak
fastened
his
end
of
the
liana
tautly
in
place
this
was
extremely
difficult
because
of
his
unnatural
position
as
well
as
the
stiffness
of
the
vine
and
his
having
to
work
with
one
hand
but
without
wasting
time
he
took
pains
to
make
sure
the
knot
was
tight
and
secure
then
he
started
climbing
again
further
and
further
toward
the
slender
top
of
the
now
bent
tree
but
carefully
lest
his
weight
and
the
bending
splinter
or
snap
the
treetop
as
it
bent
still
further
get
tight
jon
be
ready
for
the
yank
when
i
let
go
all
set
and
line
tight
yell
when
you
drop
glancing
down
to
see
that
the
way
was
clear
below
him
jak
let
his
legs
go
and
swung
by
his
arms
until
he
was
hanging
clear
he
yelled
sharply
and
let
go
plunging
down
the
fifteen
or
eighteen
feet
to
the
ground
disregarding
the
shock
he
scrambled
up
and
peered
closely
at
the
tree
then
the
vine
then
at
jon
the
tree
was
straining
to
pull
back
into
its
accustomed
erectness
the
liana
was
taut
but
bits
of
its
bark
were
flecking
off
it
creaked
so
alarmingly
jak
was
afraid
it
would
break
all
the
time
jon
was
wriggling
and
twisting
to
help
free
his
feet
and
legs
and
the
vine
held
as
the
tree
proved
its
natural
strength
and
desire
for
an
upright
position
slowly
but
surely
jon
body
was
pulled
from
its
prison
as
he
came
more
nearly
free
the
tree
snapped
upright
so
swiftly
he
was
whipped
out
of
the
water
and
a
dozen
feet
onto
the
sand
he
landed
face
down
with
a
terrific
jar
jak
ran
up
and
helped
untie
the
vine
jon
sat
up
slowly
with
his
brother
help
his
face
was
scuffed
where
it
had
slid
along
the
sandy
beach
and
he
slowly
painfully
wiped
it
somewhat
clean
with
his
handkerchief
his
breath
came
in
gasps
from
the
terrible
constriction
of
the
vine
about
his
chest
and
from
his
unusual
exertions
sympathetically
jak
hovered
about
until
finally
jon
breathing
was
a
bit
easier
when
his
brother
started
to
try
to
get
up
he
helped
and
held
him
guess
i
can
make
it
now
jon
finally
broke
away
and
did
manage
to
stand
alone
although
he
still
reeled
a
bit
from
the
fatigue
and
the
terrible
ordeal
through
which
he
had
been
he
walked
slowly
about
rolling
his
shoulders
and
moving
his
arms
and
fingers
exercising
his
cramped
muscles
jak
gave
him
a
couple
of
pills
from
his
pocket
kit
and
jon
swallowed
these
finally
he
began
collecting
his
rod
and
creel
they
danged
well
better
be
good
to
eat
he
declared
shaking
the
offending
fish
basket
it
certainly
was
worth
all
that
narrow
escape
jak
said
soberly
as
he
took
the
things
from
his
brother
and
went
over
to
pick
up
the
little
animal
carcasses
but
when
he
got
there
he
exclaimed
in
disgust
darn
those
ants
have
eaten
them
almost
all
up
we
must
let
mom
know
how
close
i
came
to
not
getting
back
jon
said
as
he
staggered
along
the
little
trail
although
as
he
went
his
strength
and
limberness
returned
somewhat
i
say
not
i
keep
my
trap
shut
one
thing
sure
though
there
be
no
more
fishing
trips
here
aw
i
would
say
that
jon
snapped
back
i
know
enough
now
to
stay
on
the
bank
and
if
these
are
good
eating
it
too
easy
a
way
to
get
fresh
food
to
waste
they
were
just
climbing
into
the
lock
when
again
that
sudden
heavy
downpour
of
rain
began
jon
grinned
as
he
opened
the
inner
door
glad
to
see
the
rain
this
time
it
keep
mom
from
wondering
why
my
clothes
are
so
wet
as
soon
as
they
had
changed
to
dry
clothing
jon
went
to
clean
his
fish
then
took
them
to
his
mother
in
the
galley
jak
meanwhile
was
in
the
control
room
rearranging
and
trying
to
begin
the
classification
of
his
plant
specimens
when
their
mother
called
them
to
table
the
boys
sniffed
appreciatively
at
the
delicious
odor
of
the
nicely
browned
they
cook
nicely
but
how
do
we
tell
if
they
good
to
eat
mrs
carver
asked
jak
flipped
one
onto
his
plate
and
cut
off
a
tiny
portion
tell
you
soon
and
he
forked
the
piece
into
his
mouth
with
his
tongue
and
teeth
he
tested
it
but
did
not
swallow
tastes
good
he
said
a
moment
later
retrieving
the
piece
with
his
fork
and
laying
it
on
the
side
of
his
plate
one
more
test
he
cut
off
another
small
piece
and
took
it
into
the
storeroom
where
he
placed
a
piece
in
one
of
the
cages
containing
half
a
dozen
white
rats
a
couple
of
them
came
up
immediately
smelled
the
food
then
one
of
them
gobbled
it
up
jak
watched
anxiously
for
a
moment
then
gave
another
rat
a
piece
it
too
gobbled
it
up
and
then
joined
the
rest
who
were
pressed
against
the
wires
begging
for
more
jak
stood
watching
for
one
minute
then
two
then
three
satisfied
that
the
meat
had
done
the
rodents
no
harm
he
returned
to
the
table
it
all
right
he
said
and
began
eating
the
rats
liked
it
and
it
did
seem
to
hurt
them
the
others
pitched
in
then
and
soon
the
entire
platterful
was
reduced
to
a
pile
of
bones
on
the
three
plates
how
father
been
today
jak
asked
he
was
asleep
when
i
glanced
at
him
after
getting
back
he
moved
about
several
times
tossing
and
groaning
a
bit
and
seeming
to
be
trying
to
touch
his
broken
leg
although
probably
it
itches
inside
the
cast
jak
said
he
did
regain
full
consciousness
but
i
tried
spooning
some
concentrated
broth
into
his
mouth
and
he
was
able
to
swallow
a
little
of
it
golly
that
great
jak
exclaimed
in
relief
his
drifting
out
of
his
coma
from
time
to
time
shows
there
is
no
real
damage
to
his
brain
and
now
he
evidently
beginning
to
come
out
of
the
concussion
whatever
it
is
i
feel
more
sure
he
soon
regain
consciousness
and
be
all
right
mrs
carver
spoke
with
quiet
confidence
of
course
he
will
mom
pop
too
tough
for
a
busted
leg
and
a
bump
on
the
head
to
kill
him
jon
smiled
at
her
comfortingly
as
the
surface
wound
heals
the
brain
tissues
beneath
will
also
be
healing
jak
said
pedantically
as
long
as
we
can
keep
him
fed
and
otherwise
healthy
the
concussion
will
grow
less
and
finally
dissipate
entirely
doctor
carver
i
presume
jon
sniggered
and
his
brother
flushed
a
bit
then
poked
him
in
the
ribs
jon
tried
not
to
wince
at
that
light
jab
luckily
their
mother
had
not
noticed
anything
so
as
quickly
as
possible
he
said
well
owl
hit
the
sack
want
to
move
around
this
planet
tomorrow
and
get
our
pics
and
info
then
take
a
look
at
the
others
jak
started
to
protest
but
caught
his
brother
almost
imperceptible
but
frantic
signal
and
changed
his
words
maybe
jon
right
at
that
and
we
should
get
an
early
start
mother
good
night
boys
she
responded
to
their
kisses
and
soon
the
two
were
in
their
bunkroom
with
the
door
closed
jak
turned
swiftly
on
his
brother
what
the
big
idea
making
us
go
to
bed
so
early
and
why
that
funny
look
you
gave
me
i
had
to
get
out
of
there
jon
winced
as
he
began
taking
off
his
shirt
and
jak
crammed
his
fist
into
his
mouth
to
keep
from
crying
out
as
he
saw
the
great
angry
red
welts
and
the
terrible
splotches
on
jon
torso
great
guns
what
happened
that
vine
must
have
really
hurt
when
it
pulled
me
loose
from
that
quicksand
i
did
notice
it
particularly
though
until
you
poked
me
in
the
ribs
jak
quickly
dragged
his
large
kit
from
its
place
in
the
wall
cupboard
and
opened
it
lie
down
on
the
bunk
and
i
fix
you
up
he
said
as
he
took
out
tubes
of
unguents
bottles
of
antiseptic
and
rolls
of
bandages
and
plasters
from
the
kit
golly
kid
i
had
no
idea
you
were
in
that
shape
or
i
have
done
this
before
jon
gritted
his
teeth
as
the
other
gently
felt
to
see
if
any
ribs
were
broken
and
later
as
jak
applied
the
healing
lotions
and
sometimes
smarting
antiseptics
but
he
could
not
entirely
restrain
his
exclamations
of
pain
although
he
muffled
them
with
his
pillow
lest
their
mother
hear
and
come
to
investigate
he
knew
his
brother
was
being
sympathetically
gentle
and
when
at
last
it
was
done
jon
did
feel
easier
the
burning
had
largely
stopped
and
some
of
the
ache
was
gone
i
better
give
you
some
barbit
so
you
sleep
sounder
jak
shook
two
small
pills
from
a
bottle
the
calmer
you
sleep
the
less
mess
up
those
dressings
and
the
quicker
you
heal
he
got
a
glass
of
water
and
jon
took
the
pills
and
washed
them
down
you
do
have
your
uses
now
and
then
he
growled
but
the
grateful
look
in
his
eyes
belied
the
ungraciousness
of
his
words
and
jak
was
well
content
in
the
morning
much
of
the
soreness
and
discoloration
was
gone
and
there
was
no
sign
of
inflammation
or
pus
after
jak
had
again
tended
to
the
abrasions
and
friction
sores
the
two
boys
dressed
and
went
in
to
breakfast
their
mother
was
in
good
spirits
breathing
seems
much
easier
than
it
was
she
announced
with
delight
they
all
went
in
to
see
him
and
while
jak
was
redressing
the
now
almost
healed
head
wound
jon
looked
on
happily
wo
be
long
now
he
hugged
his
mother
joyfully
i
hope
not
she
sighed
he
does
seem
to
be
getting
better
though
we
lucky
we
still
have
him
mother
jak
voice
was
serious
if
that
rock
had
even
touched
him
it
would
have
been
the
end
his
leg
looks
ok
no
signs
of
swelling
or
inflammation
breakfast
was
quiet
and
as
soon
as
they
finished
jon
rose
purposefully
i
take
us
up
now
and
we
cruise
around
and
see
what
we
can
see
have
to
take
lots
of
recordings
and
pictures
you
know
are
you
sure
you
understand
all
that
has
to
be
done
his
voice
was
anxious
sure
mom
it
tells
all
about
it
on
the
papers
the
colonial
board
furnished
all
we
have
to
do
is
follow
their
instructions
you
coming
jak
right
with
you
his
brother
hastily
drank
the
rest
of
his
coffee
and
rose
wiping
his
mouth
be
sure
you
strap
down
at
the
signal
mother
if
you
are
coming
with
us
she
flashed
him
a
smile
i
will
meanwhile
i
clear
the
table
if
i
have
time
she
looked
questioningly
at
jon
sure
it
take
ten
fifteen
minutes
to
get
ready
and
i
give
you
a
couple
of
warnings
when
all
was
ready
jak
strapped
himself
down
in
the
seat
the
book
of
instructions
in
his
hand
jon
touched
the
stud
of
the
buzzer
waited
a
full
minute
then
punched
two
buzzes
then
he
nodded

jon
snapped

a
dull
rumbling
began
and
the
ship
seemed
to
strain
as
the
first
tube
started
functioning
although
at
minimum
strength
he
carefully
watched
a
dial
to
see
that
it
was
working
smoothly
finally
tube
one
firing
in
like
manner
tubes
four
two
and
then
three
were
started
and
tested
and
finally
reported
firing
evenly
the
ship
seemed
more
than
ever
straining
as
though
anxious
to
get
into
the
air
and
into
free
space
but
remained
on
the
ground
up

jon
touched
another
stud
and
they
could
feel
the
motor
lifting
the
landing
props
into
their
slots
in
the
hull
take
off
the
roar
deepened
as

increased

keeping

if

jak
loosened
his
straps
and
went
to
look
out
of
the
port
but
jon
kept
his
gaze
fastened
on
the
lookout
plate
before
him
his
hands
resting
lightly
on
the
controls
although
they
were
not
connected
now
beneath
them
the
land
was
sliding
by
as
the
ship
cruised
at
the
slow
speed
for
it
of
just
under
a
thousand
miles
an
hour
the
boys
saw
the
same
sort
of
jungle
forests
the
same
occasional
clearings
from
time
to
time
the
glint
of
water
revealed
rivers
or
lakes
the
latter
seldom
more
than
a
mile
or
so
in
width
or
length
after
nearly
an
hour
they
were
flying
above
a
huge
plain
covered
with
some
sort
of
grass
or
grain
they
had
been
above
this
for
some
minutes
when
jon
uttered
an
exclamation
and
jak
came
up
quickly
to
see
what
his
brother
had
spotted
in
the
look
down
there
owl
the
younger
brother
was
excited
thousands
of
cattle
whew
most
like
those
old
we
read
the
old
pioneers
saw
on
the
western
plains
of
noramer
hey
those
things
are
tripeds
too
like
the
big
one
we
shot
and
the
rabbits
yes
i
see
must
be
the
usual
thing
here
but
those
down
there
are
smaller
like
cows
wonder
if
they
good
to
eat
or
give
milk
do
know
but
we
sure
want
to
report
this
he
took
several
pictures
with
the
recording
camera
then
made
notations
in
the
data
book
the
two
continued
watching
until
the
tremendous
herd
was
out
of
sight
behind
them
and
they
were
flying
once
more
above
a
great
forest
they
had
gone
almost
two
thousand
miles
when
they
saw
ahead
and
downward
the
beginnings
of
what
was
either
an
ocean
or
a
great
sea
as
they
drew
closer
they
still
could
not
see
its
further
shore
i
do
remember
this
from
before
do
you
jon
looked
perplexed
yes
i
think
this
must
be
the
one
we
saw
part
of
from
the
north
that
is
i
assume
it
was
north
as
we
were
near
the
icecap
but
i
realize
it
was
so
hey
look
down
there
that
proves
i
was
right
jon
pointed
triumphantly
toward
his
visiplate
see
those
marks
along
the
shore
that
means
this
moon
is
big
enough
to
cause
tides
same
as
luna
does
to
terra
what
good
really
are
tides
why
superciliously
they
one
of
the
most
useful
things
god
has
given
man
they
they
jon
stopped
flushed
then
laughed
darned
if
i
know
what
they
good
for
of
course
if
they
high
enough
men
can
make
and
produce
power
but
now
that
got
atomics
we
do
need
those
i
suppose
we
should
record
them
though
jak
was
tactful
enough
not
to
laugh
yes
write
it
down
they
were
over
an
hour
passing
above
this
ocean
and
had
begun
to
wonder
if
it
was
greater
in
extent
than
terra
pacific
but
finally
they
made
out
in
the
distance
the
dim
blueness
of
the
farther
shore
that
some
ocean
all
right
shows
there
lots
of
water
here
on
two
with
those
heavy
rains
there
almost
have
to
be
this
be
of
special
interest
to
colonists
means
not
only
plenty
of
water
but
if
that
stream
was
any
example
there
be
lots
of
fish
down
there
to
start
a
big
food
industry
later
about
two
hundred
miles
past
the
eastern
shore
of
the
ocean
they
saw
the
blue
of
mountains
in
the
decreasing
distance
soon
jon
had
to
rise
higher
and
higher
to
clear
them
safely
some
of
the
individual
peaks
seemed
to
be
nearly
five
miles
high
and
one
or
two
of
them
almost
at
the
range
of
visibility
the
boys
estimated
to
be
even
taller
probably
lots
of
metals
here
jon
commented
i
swing
back
and
over
them
again
and
let
get
to
work
yes
this
list
says
to
report
on
metallic
ores
say
does
it
seem
funny
to
you
that
there
are
no
people
on
a
world
as
capable
as
this
of
supporting
life
wonder
why
no
telling
pop
says
lots
of
earthlike
planets
do
have
any
inhabitants
capable
of
any
sort
of
civilization
but
that
means
more
worlds
for
terrans
to
colonize
jon
made
their
ship
circle
above
the
mountains
while
the
boys
took
readings
with
the
then
they
started
on
again
after
almost
another
hour
when
they
were
over
one
of
the
few
desert
places
they
had
seen
jon
suddenly
leaned
forward
with
a
little
intake
of
breath
that
his
brother
noticed
what
up
not
sure
but
listen
to
click
from
the
reading
i
think
there
must
be
some
of
that
metal
pop
was
so
positive
about
down
there
somewhere
the
stuff
for
a
new
fuel
yes
we
do
know
it
be
any
good
as
fuel
but
its
atomic
weight
seems
to
be
so
high
pop
was
all
excited
when
the
spectrogram
of
this
sun
showed
it
he
said
he
felt
sure
we
find
it
on
at
least
one
of
these
planets
it
take
a
lot
of
time
to
locate
it
exactly
wo
it
not
too
much
with
the
new
gadgets
they
have
for
locating
metal
ores
jon
tried
not
to
sound
impatient
with
his
brother
ignorance
got
one
that
lets
us
cruise
around
in
the
air
and
spot
it
fairly
close
then
land
and
find
the
exact
place
quite
easily
what
sort
of
gadget
jon
shrugged
do
know
exactly
how
they
work
but
i
can
use
one
something
like
a
spectroscope
that
works
without
first
having
to
heat
the
metals
into
gas
plus
something
like
those
old
geiger
counters
they
used
to
trace
radioactives
plus
some
other
ideas
the
technies
put
into
them
it
tells
about
them
in
one
of
our
reelbooks
there
you
go
get
ours
i
think
it
in
bin
in
the
storeroom
looks
like
a
small
black
suitcase
with
carrying
straps
meanwhile
i
get
ready
to
set
us
down
i
hurry
so
to
be
back
to
read
the
routine
for
you
while
his
brother
was
gone
jon
activated
the
bow
retarders
after
snapping
off
the
stern
tubes
then
he
sent
the
ship
into
a
curve
that
would
bring
them
back
nearer
the
place
where
he
wanted
to
land
but
only
part
of
his
mind
was
doing
that
the
rest
was
wondering
why
there
had
to
be
so
much
fuss
and
detail
in
landing
and
with
a
ship
why
could
it
be
fixed
so
one
man
could
navigate
and
pilot
without
all
this
bother
it
ought
not
to
be
too
difficult
jak
was
soon
back
with
the
recorder
and
jon
showed
him
how
to
read
it
soon
they
located
what
seemed
to
be
the
center
of
that
strange
disturbance
and
with
jak
help
jon
set
the
ship
down
on
the
sand
fairly
close
to
where
they
thought
that
metal
or
its
ore
might
be
found
when
the
two
boys
went
into
the
living
room
they
told
their
mother
what
they
had
landed
for
and
that
they
were
going
out
to
look
for
the
source
of
this
excitement
is
it
really
necessary
she
asked
anxiously
did
say
anything
to
me
about
any
such
thing
have
we
got
fuel
enough
to
get
home
on
sure
mom
jon
hastened
to
explain
but
pop
thought
this
new
stuff
would
be
a
lot
more
powerful
than
the
fuel
we
using
said
it
ought
to
give
us
far
greater
cruising
range
with
lots
less
storage
space
if
we
found
something
of
the
sort
it
would
be
a
great
contribution
to
space
travel
that
right
jak
added
and
if
we
do
find
such
a
thing
here
miners
will
soon
be
flocking
after
it
and
that
mean
credits
for
us
well
doubtfully
i
guess
you
know
best
your
father
seems
to
be
growing
better
and
lets
me
feed
him
even
though
he
has
ever
seemed
to
regain
full
consciousness
if
you
are
sure
this
is
what
he
do
if
awake
i
suppose
it
is
what
you
should
do
looks
like
a
funny
place
for
ore
jon
said
as
the
two
boys
left
the
ship
and
started
at
a
fast
pace
in
the
direction
annie
had
pointed
out
as
the
center
of
activity
i
have
expected
it
to
be
in
the
mountains
not
in
a
desert
like
this
yes
i
was
wondering
about
that
the
elder
brother
shook
his
head
slowly
but
you
can
tell
there
something
here
what
is
it
really
looking
for
oh
i
know
it
metal
or
ore
of
some
kind
he
added
hurriedly
as
he
saw
jon
start
a
retort
what
i
mean
is
is
it
ore
or
natural
nuggets
and
is
it
radioactive
or
what
jon
grinned
as
he
trotted
along
do
really
know
much
more
than
you
i
know
how
to
detect
it
and
i
know
it
if
we
find
it
but
to
tell
ahead
of
time
i
have
the
minnow
of
an
idea
they
had
actually
gone
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
the
heat
of
the
sun
reflected
from
the
hot
white
desert
sand
became
almost
unbearable
finally
jak
stopped
wiping
the
pouring
perspiration
from
his
face
and
neck
we
ca
take
much
of
this
better
go
back
and
get
our
suits
yes
guess
you
right
jon
was
also
working
his
handkerchief
overtime
the
refrigs
in
them
will
keep
us
cooler
even
if
harder
to
walk
in
and
the
will
protect
us
better
from
the
actinic
rays
of
this
sun
jak
said
we
so
close
only
or
seventy
millions
you
said
that
the
solar
rays
are
lots
stronger
than
those
we
get
back
on
terra
even
in
the
deserts
sure
those
jungle
trees
protected
us
before
so
we
did
notice
them
their
mother
heard
them
as
they
returned
and
came
to
see
what
the
trouble
was
when
they
explained
as
they
were
putting
on
their
suits
she
again
warned
them
to
be
careful
then
she
added
somewhat
hastily
it
just
a
mother
instinct
to
keep
warning
her
children
to
be
careful
i
know
you
boys
always
are
the
fact
that
you
came
back
rather
than
take
chances
shows
this
please
do
feel
badly
that
i
keep
nagging
at
you
heck
mom
we
know
you
are
nagging
jon
hugged
her
if
you
ever
quit
warning
us
that
when
we
really
get
worried
their
suits
on
and
the
refrigerators
working
the
pair
began
retracing
their
steps
jon
led
the
way
since
he
was
carrying
the
detector
they
went
in
a
decreasing
spiral
to
locate
the
center
then
made
a
beeline
for
that
spot
but
after
almost
a
mile
the
signal
seemed
to
grow
weaker
and
they
stopped
for
a
conference
must
have
passed
it
jon
said
over
his
as
his
puzzled
eyes
studied
the
meters
on
the
finder
try
going
back
thirty
or
forty
yards
to
the
right
then
back
toward
the
left
jak
suggested
soon
jon
shouted
and
started
off
in
a
new
direction
but
more
slowly
and
jak
ran
quarteringly
toward
him
inside
half
a
mile
jon
lost
the
beam
again
and
once
more
they
quartered
to
find
it
in
narrower
and
narrower
circles
they
searched
suddenly
jak
stumbled
and
fell
to
the
ground
as
he
started
to
rise
jon
heard
his
excited
yell
coming
through
his
earphones
at
his
brother
eager
cry
jon
ran
over
toward
where
the
older
boy
was
stooping
down
examining
carefully
something
almost
completely
embedded
in
the
sand
he
saw
jak
rise
take
his
shovel
from
the
carrying
straps
on
his
suit
back
and
start
uncovering
whatever
it
was
he
had
stumbled
over
as
jon
came
up
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
why
what
that
a
metal
plate
what
is
it
jak
do
know
yet
the
elder
panted
as
he
worked
even
more
feverishly
with
his
shovel
jon
quickly
laid
down
the
detector
which
was
clicking
excitedly
to
unsling
his
own
shovel
and
begin
digging
in
a
few
moments
they
had
completely
bared
the
metal
plate
and
could
now
see
it
was
about
ten
by
four
feet
and
hinged
on
one
side
looks
like
a
trap
door
sure
does
lend
a
hand
let
see
if
we
can
open
it
the
crack
along
the
edge
was
not
wide
enough
for
the
gloved
fingers
of
their
suits
so
jon
inserted
his
shovel
tip
in
the
crack
as
a
prize
jak
did
the
same
and
after
many
attempts
for
it
was
much
heavier
even
than
they
expected
they
managed
to
lift
the
edge
a
bit
can
you
hold
it
alone
a
sec
jak
asked
try
jon
threw
his
whole
weight
on
the
end
of
the
shovel
handle
while
jak
quickly
found
a
small
stone
and
wedged
it
in
the
opening
then
with
jon
moving
his
shovel
farther
and
farther
back
along
the
edge
jak
pushed
ever
larger
stones
closely
behind
him
and
they
finally
managed
to
get
the
cover
high
enough
so
they
were
able
to
tip
it
back
but
only
after
considerable
straining
and
puffing
what
do
you
suppose
is
down
there
jon
hopped
about
digging
at
the
sand
with
his
boot
tip
do
know
but
it
has
sure
been
a
long
time
since
anyone
used
this
jak
spoke
slowly
how
can
you
tell
because
of
all
the
sand
that
sifted
in
here
silly
you
do
think
this
is
just
a
box
of
sand
do
you
it
could
have
been
here
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
you
mean
there
were
people
living
here
then
the
elder
boy
shook
his
head
maybe
yes
maybe
no
it
could
have
been
folks
who
merely
visited
here
well
what
do
we
do
now
jon
picked
up
his
shovel
you
the
one
that
silly
now
we
clear
it
out
and
look
for
some
time
the
two
made
the
sand
fly
then
jak
shovel
struck
metal
and
feverishly
the
two
concentrated
on
that
spot
another
few
minutes
and
they
could
see
it
was
a
large
metal
chest
that
almost
filled
this
covered
pit
when
they
finally
had
the
top
of
the
box
completely
exposed
they
found
its
cover
fastened
with
a
simple
hasp
which
was
quickly
opened
then
they
lifted
this
second
lid
inside
the
box
was
completely
filled
with
thousands
of
small
cubes
of
some
sort
of
glistening
metal
jak
started
to
reach
for
one
but
jon
struck
his
hand
away
listen
to
that
detector
it
has
gone
crazy
he
yelled
that
deadly
radioactive
i
bet
he
started
to
scramble
out
of
the
hole
after
slamming
down
the
lid
we
get
out
of
here
but
fast
then
we
talk
about
it
jak
had
sense
enough
to
heed
his
brother
warning
and
lost
no
time
in
following
some
little
distance
away
the
two
stopped
to
debate
what
they
were
to
do
you
know
what
i
think
jon
eyes
gleamed
i
think
this
was
a
fuel
cache
left
by
people
who
used
to
make
trips
around
the
galaxy
and
not
something
left
by
people
who
once
lived
here
you
nuts
who
and
when
and
why
did
they
ever
come
to
terra
if
they
had
if
they
came
this
close
would
they
have
gone
there
too
not
necessarily
space
is
so
big
and
sol
is
relatively
small
you
know
but
maybe
they
did
get
to
earth
at
that
jon
grew
more
thoughtful
remember
our
reading
about
all
the
strange
things
people
reported
seeing
hundreds
you
mean
those
old
saucer
reports
a
couple
of
centuries
ago
yes
them
and
even
before
that
there
been
reports
of
strange
airships
and
things
why
there
was
one
that
almost
four
hundred
years
ago
of
a
dutch
sea
captain
who
saw
something
in
the
air
above
the
indi
ocean
and
reported
it
in
his
log
even
made
a
sketch
of
it
that
was
almost
exactly
like
those
made
later
by
people
who
said
seen
it
jak
had
been
thinking
back
then
maybe
the
bible
story
of
ezekiel
within
a
wheel
he
saw
in
the
air
was
one
sure
earth
people
for
centuries
have
seen
all
sorts
of
unknown
things
then
maybe
your
idea
is
so
wild
after
all
the
question
now
is
jon
ignored
the
apology
how
do
we
take
some
of
this
stuff
back
to
the
ship
and
how
do
we
test
it
to
see
if
fuel
or
do
we
that
more
your
line
than
mine
what
do
you
suggest
jon
thought
seriously
for
several
minutes
then
brightened
you
stay
here
so
i
can
see
where
i
going
and
i
go
get
the
ship
and
bring
it
here
then
we
try
one
of
those
cubes
in
the
generator
you
you
think
it
safe
what
would
get
you
out
here
in
this
desert
i
did
mean
that
and
you
know
it
i
meant
do
you
think
it
safe
to
try
this
stuff
that
way
oh
that
sure
jon
threw
down
the
extra
things
he
was
carrying
and
started
away
at
a
trot
when
he
reached
the
ship
and
was
inside
the
airlocks
he
called
to
his
mother
as
he
was
sitting
down
at
the
controls
what
the
matter
jon
she
asked
as
she
came
in
and
saw
him
working
at
the
controls
and
where
jak
we
found
something
out
there
too
heavy
to
carry
and
jak
watching
it
while
i
bring
up
the
ship
strap
down
she
sank
into
the
seat
and
fastened
the
broad
belt
about
her
even
as
jon
was
activating
the
generator
and
tubes
raggedly
since
he
was
trying
to
handle
the
controls
and
read
the
directions
at
the
same
time
it
simply
did
occur
to
him
to
ask
his
mother
to
read
them
to
him
the
boy
finally
got
the
ship
into
the
air
what
is
it
you
found
his
mother
could
contain
her
curiosity
no
longer
something
we
think
is
that
new
fuel
pop
talked
about
but
radioactive
and
we
did
dare
try
to
carry
it
without
special
equipment
he
told
her
absently
as
the
ship
began
lowering
he
maneuvered
it
to
a
bumpy
landing
close
to
his
brother
whom
they
could
now
see
through
the
port
excitedly
waving
his
arms
at
them
we
think
it
something
some
other
people
left
here
as
a
cache
a
long
long
time
ago
jon
explained
as
he
put
his
controls
in
neutral
his
voice
an
excited
squeak
some
other
earth
people
she
asked
incredulously
you
mean
we
the
first
ones
here
after
all
no
we
do
think
it
was
terrans
he
said
as
he
unstrapped
but
before
he
could
get
out
of
the
seat
they
heard
the
lockdoor
mechanisms
working
and
knew
jak
was
coming
inboard
so
the
two
stayed
in
the
control
room
jon
answered
his
mother
anxious
questions
as
best
he
could
jak
soon
came
running
in
and
the
two
boys
held
a
quick
council
almost
ignoring
their
mother
in
the
excitement
of
trying
to
figure
a
safe
way
of
bringing
some
of
the
aboard
and
trying
it
out
but
at
last
she
made
herself
heard
i
think
you
should
wait
and
let
decide
about
this
she
said
with
determination
how
is
he
awake
about
the
same
still
unconscious
then
do
you
see
mom
that
there
no
telling
when
he
wake
up
and
we
do
want
to
wait
that
long
i
still
say
you
must
take
the
chance
of
blowing
us
all
to
kingdom
come
before
you
can
have
his
advice
and
help
in
deciding
what
to
do
with
that
new
untried
and
dangerous
metal
she
declared
so
firmly
that
they
could
not
ignore
her
now
you
listen
to
your
mother
this
is
once
when
i
setting
my
foot
down
i
will
let
you
do
it
nor
could
their
pleas
move
her
all
right
mother
jak
finally
conceded
defeat
with
if
the
truth
must
be
told
an
inner
sense
of
relief
he
too
had
been
more
than
a
little
afraid
of
that
untried
stuff
but
jon
had
seemed
so
sure
while
he
knew
very
little
about
it
we
leave
it
here
while
we
go
set
our
markers
on
the
other
planets
unless
pop
wakes
up
before
we
finished
here
jon
added
sullenly
somewhat
humiliated
because
he
felt
his
mother
was
treating
him
like
a
little
boy
instead
of
the
man
and
scientist
he
now
considered
himself
to
be
when
he
does
though
you
see
he
say
we
should
have
tried
it
his
mother
understanding
well
how
he
felt
but
still
worried
over
the
possibilities
for
danger
her
anxious
mind
insisted
on
painting
patted
his
shoulder
in
that
case
son
she
said
softly
i
apologize
we
better
go
out
and
shut
that
trap
door
and
mark
the
place
some
way
before
we
leave
jak
tried
to
lighten
the
tension
i
take
measurements
of
where
we
are
and
that
do
just
as
well
jon
voice
still
held
that
injured
tone
mrs
carver
kept
her
voice
level
but
her
eyes
caught
and
held
those
of
her
younger
son
i
sorry
if
i
seem
too
stubborn
about
this
jon
but
i
just
do
like
the
idea
of
you
boys
trying
to
handle
alone
something
you
do
know
anything
about
especially
since
you
yourselves
admit
that
it
highly
dangerous
jon
petulance
slowly
disappeared
and
finally
he
grinned
and
kissed
her
you
right
as
always
mom
i
getting
too
big
for
my
coveralls
i
calculate
courses
to
one
and
to
and
around
the
sun
and
we
let
this
ride
until
pop
wakes
up
while
jak
and
mrs
carver
busied
themselves
at
other
tasks
jon
sweated
over
the
complicated
math
of
the
new
courses
he
knew
how
important
this
was
especially
the
plan
he
had
in
mind
for
placing
the
marker
in
its
orbit
about
the
sun
he
knew
their
very
lives
depended
on
the
correctness
of
his
calculations
so
he
did
them
slowly
carefully
and
checked
them
closely
to
make
sure
he
had
done
them
right
and
made
no
mistakes
but
when
he
was
finished
he
put
the
sheets
of
calculations
in
a
drawer
took
more
paper
and
figured
the
courses
over
a
second
time
that
solution
he
also
put
in
the
drawer
and
figured
it
the
third
time
without
consulting
what
he
had
done
before
when
he
had
completed
this
third
computation
he
took
out
the
other
two
sets
and
compared
the
three
all
came
out
exactly
the
same
and
he
gasped
in
relief
and
sank
back
trembling
with
thankfulness
in
the
pilot
seat
they
must
be
right
while
mrs
carver
and
her
sons
were
eating
lunch
they
heard
a
weak
call
from
the
bunkroom
and
ran
in
to
find
their
father
fully
awake
he
seemed
surprised
at
his
condition
but
jak
explained
swiftly
what
had
happened
and
jon
told
briefly
what
they
had
done
and
were
planning
to
do
next
that
good
that
very
good
he
said
drowsily
and
before
jon
could
say
anything
about
finding
that
new
metal
his
father
had
again
sunk
into
sleep
or
unconsciousness
not
even
jak
could
tell
which
well
jon
tried
to
be
brave
about
his
disappointment
i
guess
just
have
to
go
ahead
but
is
it
swell
that
pop
woke
up
fully
it
certainly
is
mrs
carver
had
tears
of
joy
in
her
eyes
now
we
know
he
soon
be
all
right
the
trip
to
planet
one
tad
was
neither
long
nor
eventful
once
they
got
started
they
found
as
expected
that
the
small
world
smaller
than
sol
mercury
was
so
close
to
the
sun
that
it
was
fearfully
hot
even
on
the
equator
or
intermediate
zone
despite
the
refrigerators
on
the
ship
it
was
becoming
hot
inside
and
all
stripped
as
far
as
decency
allowed
the
planet
had
no
real
atmosphere
but
many
of
the
metals
indeed
the
very
rocks
themselves
were
so
largely
molten
especially
on
the
eternally
sunward
side
that
there
was
a
fog
of
gasses
about
the
surface
these
gaseous
emanations
were
in
a
state
of
motion
much
like
that
of
earthly
cyclones
constantly
swirling
and
blowing
with
terrific
velocity
the
boys
carefully
examined
their
but
annie
showed
none
of
that
strange
they
were
so
keen
to
locate
in
its
natural
state
maybe
we
found
all
there
is
here
jak
suggested
perhaps
but
somehow
i
ca
feel
that
way
jon
voice
was
worried
i
must
have
slipped
somewhere
do
see
how
just
one
boxful
could
have
shown
up
so
clearly
from
as
many
light
years
away
as
we
first
discovered
it
despite
the
conditions
the
young
planet
mappers
found
here
on
one
the
colonial
law
required
that
a
sending
beacon
be
set
up
on
all
planets
or
else
in
an
orbit
about
them
they
decided
to
place
theirs
on
top
of
one
of
the
highest
of
the
small
mountains
that
comprised
the
twilight
zone
jon
made
up
the
tape
for
this
planet
while
jak
brought
it
from
the
storeroom
when
the
tape
was
installed
and
running
the
sender
was
placed
in
the
lock
between
the
inner
and
outer
doors
and
the
boys
returned
to
the
control
room
jon
directed
the
ship
toward
the
range
of
mountains
and
when
he
neared
them
jak
from
his
seat
worked
the
remote
controls
and
the
outer
lockdoor
swung
open
then
he
activated
the
distant
hands
the
handling
mechanism
that
was
an
integral
part
of
the
equipment
for
handling
materials
into
and
out
of
the
ship
watching
through
his
special
visiplate
really
a
sort
of
television
jak
made
the
grips
pick
up
the
box
ready
to
deposit
it
on
the
hard
hot
ground
outside
when
jon
would
swoop
down
over
the
mountaintop
move
it
outside
jon
called
and
jak
did
so
set
it
down
jon
yelled
and
as
soon
as
he
was
sure
jak
had
placed
the
sender
solidly
sent
the
rising
higher
and
away
from
the
planet
then
jak
closed
the
outer
door
turned
in
his
seat
and
tuned
in
their
receiver
soon
they
caught
the
message
and
knew
everything
was
jetting
fair
nice
going
owl
jon
applauded
aw
you
just
saying
that
because
it
true
jak
grunted
and
jon
turned
his
attention
once
more
to
his
controls
and
the
new
course
he
had
plotted
for
their
swing
around
the
sun
of
this
system
now
less
than
thirty
million
miles
away
how
close
go
jak
was
more
interested
than
fearful
having
confidence
in
his
brother
skill
we
have
to
follow
a
course
so
that
when
the
sender
is
dumped
it
will
take
up
a
closed
orbit
the
more
nearly
circular
the
better
around
the
sun
also
we
have
to
have
speed
enough
so
we
wo
get
fried
to
a
crisp
at
the
which
figures
to
be
about
ten
million
miles
is
that
pretty
close
their
mother
who
had
slipped
into
the
control
room
quietly
just
after
jak
had
placed
the
sender
tried
not
to
sound
too
frightened
relax
mother
the
kid
knows
what
he
doing
jak
tried
to
calm
her
i
figured
this
three
times
mom
jon
said
earnestly
got
the
same
answer
each
time
so
i
we
can
do
it
well
still
doubtfully
i
guess
you
do
know
what
you
are
doing
but
that
seems
awfully
close
she
struggled
with
herself
and
finally
managed
a
weak
smile
i
promised
to
let
you
boys
make
the
decisions
i
go
lie
down
in
my
bunk
so
i
wo
know
what
happening
until
all
over
you
do
that
mother
i
not
worrying
jon
really
knows
his
stuff
jak
assured
her
brightly
but
as
soon
as
she
had
left
the
control
room
he
turned
worried
eyes
to
his
brother
i
i
hope
you
actually
do
chubby
his
voice
quavered
a
bit
jon
grinned
mockingly
there
one
sure
thing
if
i
wrong
never
know
it
but
i
studied
this
a
lot
since
i
knew
it
was
up
to
me
i
know
the
technique
and
as
i
said
before
i
computed
our
course
three
times
and
come
up
with
the
same
figures
each
time
and
we
have
to
set
it
as
close
as
possible
now
either
hit
your
bunk
or
set
your
seat
to
recline
we
up
to
better
than
two
g
already
and
building
to
five
yes
i
feel
us
getting
heavier
i
stay
with
you
jak
made
sure
his
straps
were
in
place
then
tilted
his
seat
jon
cranked
his
own
to
recline
the
control
panel
automatically
slanting
to
keep
it
in
the
same
relative
position
his
arms
were
resting
on
movable
slides
and
the
controls
he
would
have
to
manipulate
on
this
dangerous
orbit
were
all
beneath
his
hands
and
fingers
closer
and
closer
they
drove
to
the
sun
with
ever
mounting
speed
their
gallant
little
ship
refrigerators
were
full
on
all
shutters
in
place
their
only
view
of
the
outside
was
through
one
visiplate
whose
aperture
was
closed
until
only
a
tiny
slit
was
open
but
it
was
enough
although
jon
was
forced
to
keep
building
up
layer
after
layer
of
protective
colored
plastic
to
make
the
intense
blinding
light
of
the
swiftly
approaching
sun
bearable
clearly
visible
now
were
the
tremendous
streamers
of
matter
the
sun
was
throwing
up
as
prominences
jon
was
able
to
see
huge
sunspots
occurring
here
and
there
about
the
surface
of
that
mighty
furnace
tremendous
cyclonic
storms
of
atomic
disintegration
so
interested
was
he
in
this
first
close
view
of
a
sun
that
he
almost
forgot
the
reason
for
this
dangerous
trip
almost
but
not
quite
for
his
mind
was
to
remember
the
things
that
had
to
be
recalled
young
as
he
was
so
his
eyes
glanced
often
at
the
distance
gauge
soon
he
yelled
at
jak
get
ready
to
throw
out
the
sender
jak
struggled
to
place
his
hands
on
the
controls
a
thing
he
had
not
had
the
foresight
to
do
before
jon
started
building
up
that
tremendous
acceleration
his
muscles
strained
sweat
broke
out
on
him
even
worse
than
that
the
heat
from
the
sun
brought
his
breathing
became
gasps
there
seemed
to
be
a
constricting
band
about
his
chest
his
eyes
felt
as
though
the
balls
were
being
pushed
down
into
his
head
he
just
could
possibly
move
a
muscle
under
this
terrible
pressure
still
he
exerted
every
force
of
will
and
of
muscle
slowly
painfully
he
stretched
out
his
fingertips
a
fraction
of
an
inch
he
dug
them
into
the
fabric
of
the
arm
rest
and
pulled
the
palm
of
his
hand
along
then
he
forced
the
rest
of
his
arm
to
follow
his
fingers
and
hand
over
and
over
straining
to
do
what
had
to
be
done
then
victory
at
last
his
hand
and
arm
were
on
the
sliding
arms
now
it
was
easier
and
soon
his
fingers
were
on
the
controls
when
he
panted
then
open
the
outer
door
now
we
almost
there
jon
commanded
watching
his
controls
intently
we
going
so
fast
have
much
time
you
sure
sender
keep
correct
orbit
sure
jon
voice
was
confident
if
we
do
dump
exactly
on
zero
it
just
change
shape
of
orbit
a
little
that
all
door
open
jak
reported
a
moment
later
lift
sender
but
do
eject
yet
right
more
minutes
while
the
heat
increased
and
even
through
that
tiny
aperture
and
the
covering
shields
the
blinding
light
was
coming
in
so
fiercely
jon
was
tempted
to
close
it
entirely
then
with
a
snort
of
disgust
at
his
stupidity
he
did
close
it
and
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
as
that
piercing
beam
died
he
did
need
to
see
there
was
no
reason
to
look
even
if
there
was
it
was
too
late
now
to
do
anything
about
it
if
his
calculations
were
correct
the
ship
would
get
away
safely
if
his
figures
were
wrong
he
shuddered
well
they
never
know
it
that
was
for
sure
he
made
himself
forget
that
dire
possibility
and
kept
his
eyes
glued
to
his
indicators
almost
there
ready
jak
tensed
his
hand
and
fingers
above
the
controls
he
hoped
he
could
do
it
when
the
time
came
but
this
awful
heat
this
horrible
acceleration
pressure
drop
it
jon
yelled
suddenly
jak
tensed
hand
and
fingers
and
tried
to
depress
the
button
it
seemed
he
could
move
he
gritted
his
teeth
and
again
called
upon
his
inner
strength
his
will
from
that
hidden
depth
he
found
that
extra
measure
of
energy
necessary
to
curve
his
fingertip
downward
his
eyes
peering
into
the
shielded
intercom
visiplate
saw
those
distant
hands
the
in
the
lock
swing
the
box
out
through
the
opened
doorway
when
he
could
no
longer
see
it
because
of
the
angle
at
which
his
visiplate
was
set
he
touched
and
depressed
the
second
button
now
if
the
mechanism
was
still
functioning
in
spite
of
that
terrific
heat
its
arms
were
opening
and
the
box
slipping
away
he
withdrew
the
handling
arms
and
as
they
came
into
sight
again
he
saw
with
satisfaction
that
they
were
empty
he
locked
them
into
their
cradle
then
closed
the
outer
lockdoor
done
he
reported
thankfully
and
let
himself
go
unconsciousness
claimed
him
at
once
why
suffer
had
been
his
thought
when
he
could
so
easily
sleep
until
this
intolerable
pressure
was
gone
so
quickly
did
he
slip
away
he
did
not
realize
that
jon
too
after
a
final
quick
glance
at
his
board
and
knowing
that
everything
necessary
had
been
done
had
also
relaxed
into
unconsciousness
did
not
know
or
care
that
their
ship
was
now
speeding
around
and
away
from
the
sun
did
not
realize
that
all
four
of
the
carvers
were
now
unconscious
but
their
blackout
did
not
last
too
long
in
a
few
hours
during
which
the
took
them
smoothly
and
accurately
away
from
that
titanic
furnace
safety
distance
was
attained
and
the
frightful
acceleration
began
to
ease
by
the
time
they
were
traveling
at
a
little
less
than
two
gravities
jon
stirred
his
memory
cells
began
functioning
once
more
and
slowly
he
awakened
as
soon
as
he
realized
where
he
was
and
why
he
glanced
at
his
various
telltales
we
made
it
he
yelled
triumphantly
then
as
he
heard
no
reply
from
his
brother
he
quickly
raised
his
seat
to
upright
and
turned
to
look
at
jak
the
latter
was
still
lying
down
his
face
white
and
strained
quickly
anxiously
jon
released
himself
and
sprang
across
to
his
brother
side
he
rubbed
jak
wrists
and
temples
soon
the
flush
of
returning
blood
showed
and
the
elder
sighed
and
opened
his
eyes
we
made
it
jon
cried
again
as
he
pushed
jak
seat
into
erect
everything
went
off
jak
struggled
into
full
consciousness
then
began
loosening
his
straps
mother
and
father
he
exclaimed
did
they
come
through
all
right
at
jak
question
jon
started
have
looked
yet
let
go
see
the
two
raced
into
the
living
room
and
into
their
parents
bunkroom
mrs
carver
was
just
opening
her
eyes
and
seeing
the
boys
anxious
looks
struggled
to
sit
up
they
helped
her
and
jak
turned
quickly
to
look
at
his
father
to
his
relief
the
latter
pulse
was
no
weaker
and
his
breathing
was
regular
we
got
through
all
safely
jon
assured
his
mother
and
she
threw
her
arms
about
him
and
broke
into
tears
hey
no
need
of
crying
now
all
over
i
know
she
reached
down
for
a
corner
of
her
apron
and
wiped
her
eyes
just
relief
i
guess
is
all
right
she
asked
jak
did
seem
to
hurt
him
a
bit
indeed
just
then
there
was
a
mutter
from
mr
carver
lips
and
his
eyelids
fluttered
open
the
three
gathered
closely
beside
him
and
were
tremendously
heartened
at
the
look
of
sane
awareness
in
his
eyes
hullo
as
though
surprised
to
find
himself
in
bed
and
the
others
gathered
about
him
did
i
oversleep
jak
reached
out
and
took
his
father
hand
no
father
you
been
a
little
ill
and
unconscious
that
all
but
you
almost
well
now
a
bit
more
rest
and
you
be
all
the
invalid
looked
surprised
then
doubtfully
at
his
wife
who
quickly
stooped
and
kissed
him
jak
right
you
get
some
more
sleep
so
you
get
strong
quicker
dutifully
he
closed
his
eyes
and
immediately
his
regular
breathing
told
the
three
he
was
asleep
once
more
quietly
jak
drew
the
others
out
of
the
bunkroom
and
closed
the
door
then
his
eyes
shone
and
he
grabbed
his
mother
and
danced
her
about
while
jon
tried
to
get
into
the
act
he
almost
well
he
almost
well
jak
chanted
jon
yelled
in
honest
praise
you
did
a
grand
job
owl
but
his
voice
broke
into
a
boyish
treble
with
the
excitement
after
several
minutes
of
jubilation
jon
went
back
into
the
control
room
and
began
figuring
their
course
to
planet
three
he
turned
on
the
receiver
and
pointed
the
directional
antenna
soon
the
broadcast
of
their
solar
signal
came
in
this
one
about
the
sun
had
most
worried
him
but
he
could
read
it
clearly
this
solar
system
was
first
discovered
and
charted
by
tad
carver
of
terra
on
fourteenth
january
it
has
been
named
and
the
five
planets
and
seven
satellites
are
being
charted
and
named
details
will
be
filed
with
the
terran
colonial
board
finally
jon
finished
his
astrogation
then
went
back
into
the
living
quarters
ready
to
set
course
to
three
folks
strap
down
while
i
change
course
how
long
it
take
just
under
a
couple
of
days
at
two
g
ouch
do
we
have
to
go
that
fast
jak
complained
you
want
to
get
there
do
you
jon
turned
away
indifferently
while
mrs
carver
smiled
at
jak
and
shrugged
during
the
balance
of
that
day
jon
stayed
in
the
control
room
when
either
of
the
others
looked
in
he
was
studying
intently
right
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
he
put
in
a
long
session
at
the
computer
and
his
drawing
board
then
after
lunch
went
into
the
storeroom
after
a
while
he
came
out
with
his
arms
filled
with
wires
cells
relays
and
other
oddments
which
he
carried
into
the
control
room
the
others
busy
with
their
own
work
and
chores
paid
no
special
attention
to
what
jon
was
doing
seeing
him
busy
like
this
had
become
so
commonplace
they
seldom
bothered
even
asking
what
he
was
doing
when
he
did
not
volunteer
the
information
but
as
they
approached
planet
three
early
the
following
morning
under
negative
acceleration
all
three
were
in
the
control
room
peering
intently
into
the
visiplates
what
would
they
find
there
would
there
be
people
of
some
sort
cities
jungles
deserts
ice
fields
all
three
minds
were
busy
with
such
conjectures
as
they
came
closer
in
their
instruments
had
already
told
them
three
possessed
an
atmosphere
containing
water
vapor
so
they
knew
it
could
not
be
entirely
untenable
unless
the
air
contained
poisonous
gases
but
what
real
conditions
they
would
discover
there
remained
to
be
seen
they
had
already
found
charted
and
photographed
the
two
small
moons
that
circled
the
planet
one
of
these
was
fairly
large
about
nine
hundred
miles
in
diameter
and
the
other
much
smaller
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
three
itself
was
about
five
thousand
miles
through
there
are
clouds
down
there
jak
called
suddenly
as
they
approached
ever
nearer
at
constantly
decreasing
speed
yes
i
see
them
and
there
a
big
ocean
their
mother
was
equally
excited
three
only
about
thirty
million
farther
away
than
two
although
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
sun
right
now
so
there
should
be
too
much
difference
except
three
be
colder
jon
stated
we
about
a
hundred
miles
up
now
so
i
throwing
us
into
a
descending
spiral
there
a
big
mountain
range
and
some
of
the
peaks
are
jak
called
out
a
few
minutes
later
i
see
them
we
down
to
about
twenty
miles
now
and
i
setting
a
crisscross
orbit
for
two
or
three
revolutions
to
get
a
better
view
and
take
our
first
pictures
mom
if
you
can
tear
yourself
away
hungry
she
stepped
back
from
the
screen
laughing
you
always
hungry
then
she
glanced
at
her
and
gasped
in
dismay
no
wonder
it
over
an
hour
past
lunchtime
we
yell
if
anything
especially
interesting
shows
up
jak
called
as
she
was
leaving
by
circling
the
planet
from
east
to
west
they
kept
to
the
daylight
side
most
of
the
time
and
as
the
hours
passed
they
were
able
to
get
most
of
their
pictures
and
reports
on
the
geography
climate
and
other
conditions
their
showed
considerable
mineral
deposits
in
many
of
the
places
over
which
they
passed
they
saw
plenty
of
vegetation
and
jon
exclaimed
about
its
coloring
must
be
fall
here
jak
explained
unless
of
course
those
plants
do
contain
chlorophyll
which
i
doubt
but
nowhere
did
they
see
anything
that
looked
like
the
works
of
intelligent
beings
like
planet
two
there
was
no
sign
of
people
anywhere
when
they
became
so
tired
they
could
no
longer
keep
awake
jon
set
the
ship
into
a
higher
safer
orbit
and
they
all
went
to
bed
their
father
had
awakened
only
once
during
the
day
and
then
only
for
a
few
minutes
nor
had
his
wife
allowed
him
to
talk
greatly
as
the
boys
especially
desired
it
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
jon
maneuvered
the
ship
down
closer
to
the
surface
and
they
completed
exploring
the
planet
taking
their
pictures
and
recordings
jak
made
tests
and
reported
the
atmosphere
not
poisonous
although
so
scant
they
would
have
to
wear
suits
most
of
the
time
when
outdoors
it
lots
better
than
mars
but
not
near
as
dense
as
terra
or
two
back
there
he
told
jon
temp
below
freezing
but
i
imagine
it
get
warmer
when
the
sun
nearer
noon
here
humans
can
adapt
themselves
to
living
here
then
jon
voice
was
joyful
they
already
colonized
planets
worse
than
this
as
far
as
temperature
and
air
are
concerned
yes
the
human
animal
seems
to
be
marvelously
adaptable
to
almost
any
conditions
not
actually
poisonous
jak
said
admiringly
there
even
a
colony
of
people
from
the
high
andes
of
souamer
living
on
mars
now
without
domes
they
could
transport
those
andean
indians
to
mars
direct
because
they
were
used
to
living
in
the
rarefied
atmosphere
of
the
high
mountains
eh
that
right
those
indians
would
have
suffocated
at
sea
level
back
on
terra
indeed
they
seldom
went
down
the
mountains
below
ten
thousand
feet
because
of
the
discomfort
on
mars
they
had
some
difficulty
at
first
but
i
understand
the
second
generation
born
there
are
perfectly
at
home
jon
blue
eyes
had
been
watching
his
detectors
even
while
his
ears
had
been
listening
to
jak
explanations
so
far
he
had
not
discovered
any
of
that
strange
if
it
was
fuel
they
had
found
on
two
he
spoke
of
this
now
to
his
brother
wonder
if
those
people
leave
any
caches
here
on
three
or
what
maybe
they
did
like
cold
weather
jak
grinned
more
likely
though
either
we
have
come
close
enough
to
detect
it
or
else
they
may
only
have
made
a
cache
on
one
planet
in
a
system
that
probably
it
i
been
watching
for
it
all
the
way
in
and
did
chirp
at
all
well
do
we
land
and
see
what
the
joint
is
like
do
know
about
you
chubby
but
i
sure
want
to
how
about
closer
to
the
equator
ought
to
be
warmer
there
and
more
comfortable
i
want
to
study
that
plant
life
ok
by
me
if
you
do
try
to
load
the
boat
with
your
specimens
jon
laughed
and
jak
joined
in
sheepishly
i
promise
not
to
go
like
i
did
last
time
going
to
land
mom
strap
down
jon
called
into
the
intercom
jak
reached
for
the
sheet
of
landing
instructions
but
jon
shook
his
head
do
think
we
need
those
tighten
your
belt
here
we
go
hey
what
gives
jak
eyes
widened
as
he
saw
his
brother
throw
in
one
switch
and
then
take
his
hands
off
the
controls
although
his
eyes
were
alertly
watching
his
many
dials
and
lights
and
his
body
was
tensely
ready
for
emergencies
jon
did
not
answer
and
jak
watched
in
the
plate
as
the
ground
below
appeared
to
rush
closer
each
second
it
almost
seemed
to
him
they
were
not
slowing
as
fast
as
was
usual
on
landings
but
he
was
not
unduly
worried
he
trusted
jon
to
know
what
he
was
doing
even
if
he
did
but
apparently
jon
was
not
satisfied
for
when
the
ship
was
only
a
few
hundred
yards
above
ground
he
suddenly
worked
frantically
at
his
controls
and
the
nose
of
the
little
yacht
came
up
sharply
and
she
zoomed
into
the
upper
air
with
a
push
from
her
stern
tubes
miles
up
jon
set
the
ship
into
a
circular
orbit
then
got
out
of
his
pilot
seat
and
began
tinkering
with
some
of
the
controls
what
wrong
jak
asked
how
come
you
went
down
without
following
the
manual
and
then
came
up
again
but
jon
was
and
uncommunicative
their
mother
voice
came
over
the
intercom
asking
why
they
had
not
landed
and
jon
answered
her
question
just
a
slight
miscalculation
of
height
mom
so
i
came
up
to
try
again
he
answered
stay
strapped
down
i
be
going
down
again
in
a
minute
soon
he
was
back
in
his
seat
scanning
his
various
instruments
then
again
jak
saw
him
throw
that
one
switch
once
more
the
little
ship
began
settling
toward
the
ground
beneath
without
any
handling
of
the
controls
this
time
the
landing
was
smooth
soft
and
even
still
without
any
move
by
jon
jak
could
feel
the
various
generators
and
engines
stop
the
landing
props
go
down
and
finally
the
board
show
a
clear
green
neutral
condition
how
how
come
jak
gasped
and
this
time
jon
chose
to
answer
just
rigged
up
a
series
of
cells
and
relays
so
now
all
i
have
to
do
is
throw
one
switch
and
it
takes
care
of
all
the
little
details
of
landing
just
as
this
other
one
does
of
jon
tried
to
make
it
sound
like
an
offhand
comment
my
ratio
was
off
a
bit
and
that
was
what
i
had
to
fix
but
but
that
something
brand
new
is
it
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
jak
still
could
hardly
believe
what
he
had
just
witnessed
oh
it
was
so
much
a
much
jon
looked
down
as
he
guessed
that
his
brother
would
soon
realize
what
a
remarkable
thing
he
had
done
boy
you
good
jak
applauded
and
as
their
mother
came
into
the
control
room
he
almost
shouted
jon
gone
and
landed
so
we
could
go
out
a
bit
and
make
a
fuller
report
in
our
log
jon
cut
in
sharply
with
a
warning
look
at
his
senior
how
pop
been
moving
about
some
although
he
has
wakened
fully
yet
today
his
breathing
is
much
easier
he
still
makes
noises
but
then
he
always
did
sort
of
snore
when
he
slept
the
boys
went
with
her
into
the
bunkroom
to
look
at
their
father
before
they
started
outside
there
was
a
flush
of
color
on
his
skin
although
it
was
paler
than
its
usual
state
when
jak
examined
the
side
of
his
patient
head
he
could
see
that
it
was
practically
healed
also
the
broken
leg
seemed
in
fine
shape
as
seen
through
the
clear
plastic
of
the
cast
he
be
waking
up
for
good
any
day
now
i
sure
he
said
thankfully
gosh
i
hope
so
jon
said
i
feel
like
a
fish
out
of
water
without
my
pop
you
seem
to
be
doing
fine
anyway
his
mother
cheered
him
and
so
is
jak
she
hastened
to
add
fearful
her
elder
son
might
think
her
prejudiced
the
boys
went
out
to
get
ready
for
their
outside
trip
what
the
big
idea
not
letting
me
tell
mother
about
your
new
dinkus
for
landings
and
jak
railed
aw
she
would
understand
it
and
it
worry
her
for
fear
it
would
work
jon
was
clearly
uncomfortable
about
the
praise
he
could
not
help
seeing
in
his
brother
eyes
i
tell
pop
when
he
wakes
up
come
on
i
race
you
into
our
suits
the
boys
donned
their
spacesuits
and
examined
each
other
to
make
sure
they
were
tight
they
saw
to
it
that
their
guns
and
bandoliers
were
fully
loaded
that
they
had
with
them
what
tools
and
other
equipment
they
felt
might
be
needed
then
they
opened
the
lockdoors
and
went
outside
they
started
off
in
a
predetermined
direction
having
made
plans
to
go
about
five
miles
then
they
would
swing
in
a
circle
around
the
ship
if
they
saw
anything
they
thought
exceptionally
interesting
they
would
make
short
side
trips
and
if
necessary
complete
their
circle
on
another
day
in
any
event
they
had
promised
their
mother
to
be
back
by
dark
the
first
leg
of
their
journey
was
completed
without
any
excitement
although
jak
was
continually
finding
new
plants
he
wanted
to
collect
for
future
study
nix
owl
not
this
trip
jon
kept
protesting
you
promised
remember
oh
all
right
killjoy
but
there
so
much
here
i
want
to
find
out
about
yes
so
much
you
could
even
make
a
dent
in
it
in
a
lifetime
want
us
to
leave
you
behind
to
do
it
you
just
try
that
and
i
knock
your
teeth
loose
you
and
what
platoon
of
space
marines
jon
jeered
knowing
that
with
his
greater
size
and
strength
jak
could
not
make
good
his
threat
even
if
he
had
really
wanted
to
bickering
in
more
or
less
friendly
fashion
they
covered
their
first
five
miles
then
turned
to
the
left
and
started
circling
about
a
mile
of
this
and
they
entered
a
fairly
large
wood
the
trees
here
were
so
strange
the
boys
looked
about
them
with
a
growing
excitement
unconsciously
they
drew
closer
together
and
finally
jon
voiced
what
was
in
both
their
minds
i
beginning
to
get
scared
jak
ought
we
to
keep
trying
to
go
this
way
i
not
sure
slowly
i
getting
a
feeling
there
something
here
that
seems
to
be
unfriendly
perhaps
dangerous
but
there
is
a
thing
we
can
see
not
even
animal
life
maybe
it
only
because
this
forest
is
so
unlike
either
those
on
terra
or
the
ones
on
two
but
jon
gripped
his
rifle
more
tightly
and
his
thumb
unlocked
the
safety
catch
the
two
boys
finally
came
to
a
dead
halt
in
a
small
clearing
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
in
diameter
and
examined
more
closely
the
few
trees
and
bushes
about
them
the
ground
on
which
they
were
now
standing
was
bare
and
sandy
although
beneath
the
trees
it
had
been
more
like
black
loam
this
sand
must
be
why
there
practically
no
vegetation
here
jak
said
he
dug
into
the
ground
a
bit
and
found
it
to
be
sand
as
deep
as
he
went
rising
he
looked
even
more
closely
at
the
trees
about
the
edge
of
the
clearing
not
one
of
them
was
the
straight
slim
type
with
which
they
were
familiar
these
were
ungainly
and
appeared
stunted
although
many
were
actually
close
to
thirty
feet
tall
even
so
they
looked
too
large
in
diameter
for
their
height
none
of
them
had
more
than
five
or
six
twigless
leafless
limbs
and
those
were
almost
as
large
in
diameter
as
the
trunks
from
which
they
grew
these
branches
twisted
and
curved
although
in
most
cases
the
curve
was
upward
so
that
the
leafless
limbs
often
ended
at
a
higher
point
than
the
main
trunk
of
the
tree
suddenly
jak
began
laughing
but
with
a
mirthless
laughter
as
jon
looked
at
him
in
surprise
the
elder
tried
to
calm
himself
i
know
what
makes
them
look
so
scary
he
finally
said
between
gasps
it
that
weird
look
but
remember
those
pictures
we
seen
of
the
zona
and
newmex
deserts
in
noramer
back
home
remember
the
josha
trees
growing
there
they
as
as
anything
on
terra
and
these
look
something
like
them
jon
too
began
grinning
as
remembrance
came
let
ourselves
get
scared
over
nothing
did
we
come
on
let
travel
and
he
started
forward
yet
the
strangeness
persisted
and
before
the
boys
had
passed
through
the
fringe
of
those
tortured
trees
on
the
other
side
of
that
wood
they
started
to
get
that
queazy
feeling
again
in
spite
of
their
realization
of
what
caused
it
they
began
going
more
slowly
cautiously
ready
for
a
quick
turn
and
run
yet
both
inwardly
hating
themselves
for
the
fear
and
each
determined
not
to
let
the
other
know
he
was
afraid
but
it
was
with
a
distinct
sense
of
relief
that
they
saw
the
end
of
that
forest
ahead
of
them
unconsciously
they
hurried
their
steps
until
they
were
almost
trotting
for
the
balance
of
their
trip
jon
was
strangely
acquiescent
as
jak
became
more
and
more
engrossed
in
the
strange
plant
life
of
this
world
three
he
knew
that
this
was
jak
dish
and
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
defer
to
the
elder
knowledge
and
desire
to
learn
his
main
concern
was
to
keep
his
brother
from
overloading
himself
with
specimens
or
from
loitering
too
much
jak
had
been
especially
studying
the
soil
here
jon
noticed
and
finally
he
asked
about
it
notice
one
peculiar
thing
about
this
planet
what
on
your
mind
the
total
absence
as
far
as
we
seen
of
any
sort
or
type
of
protoplasmic
life
jak
reported
hey
that
right
though
i
had
thought
of
it
before
our
examination
from
the
air
i
remember
now
showed
no
animals
birds
or
people
plenty
of
vegetation
though
yes
it
has
everything
in
that
line
i
wonder
though
he
paused
and
he
grew
thoughtful
wonder
what
how
those
plants
can
grow
without
any
worms
or
ants
or
anything
to
loosen
and
irrigate
the
soil
and
no
animals
or
birds
to
make
fertilizers
or
bees
or
butterflies
or
anything
to
carry
pollen
jon
shrugged
would
have
the
foggiest
that
your
line
not
mine
but
they
must
do
it
some
way
there
sure
lots
of
plant
life
here
but
jak
was
still
shaking
his
head
in
puzzlement
as
they
finally
returned
to
the
ship
it
was
quite
dark
outside
when
the
boys
went
into
the
control
room
after
dinner
jon
went
over
to
the
while
jak
began
working
with
his
plant
specimens
jak
come
here
jon
called
after
a
moment
or
two
the
elder
prompted
by
the
curious
urgency
in
his
brother
voice
left
his
specimens
and
ran
to
the
other
side
what
those
things
jak
stared
through
the
port
in
amazement
outside
drifting
across
the
clearing
were
nearly
a
dozen
large
spherical
things
like
ghostly
white
balloons
they
must
have
been
almost
a
yard
in
diameter
and
by
straining
their
eyes
the
boys
could
see
tentacles
or
tendrils
of
some
sort
depending
from
the
bottom
surfaces
gosh
never
saw
anything
like
those
let
go
out
and
see
what
they
are
let
not
and
say
we
did
jon
retorted
i
want
to
find
out
more
about
them
first
he
went
over
to
the
control
panel
and
switched
on
the
searchlight
as
well
as
the
pilot
looking
into
the
latter
he
was
able
to
direct
the
light
so
it
shone
on
a
couple
of
the
floating
balls
jak
was
studying
the
plants
for
so
he
believed
them
to
be
more
carefully
now
that
they
were
lighted
but
after
a
moment
he
yelped
excitedly
hey
they
deflating
must
be
the
light
does
it
jon
was
watching
them
in
his
screen
yes
i
see
now
what
causes
it
i
do
know
jak
answered
sadly
and
absently
but
i
sure
want
to
know
how
about
covering
me
while
i
go
out
and
see
if
i
can
get
one
well
maybe
in
your
suit
you
be
safe
once
suited
up
jak
went
outside
and
across
the
short
distance
to
where
the
balls
seems
to
be
slightly
closer
together
he
tried
first
one
way
and
then
another
to
catch
one
but
at
his
lightest
touch
they
burst
and
deflated
after
several
unsuccessful
attempts
though
he
called
excitedly
through
his
jon
you
read
me
coming
through
i
going
to
try
fanning
one
toward
the
i
want
to
see
if
we
can
get
an
idea
of
what
inside
i
got
a
screwy
hunch
right
i
switch
the
light
away
from
them
up
into
the
air
carefully
jak
herded
one
of
the
globes
near
the
ship
and
was
finally
successful
in
getting
it
close
to
the
of
the
when
it
was
almost
touching
the
ship
side
he
reached
out
and
touched
it
and
it
promptly
broke
get
anything
he
yelled
yes
gas
of
some
sort
taking
the
reading
now
it
seems
to
be
mostly
nitrogen
hah
that
it
then
i
coming
in
when
jak
was
back
inside
jon
helped
him
remove
his
helmet
then
demanded
curiously
what
it
all
about
owl
i
not
positive
of
course
but
i
bet
those
things
take
the
place
of
bees
for
pollinating
and
also
furnish
the
fertilizer
for
the
ground
when
they
burst
and
their
nitrogen
gets
into
the
soil
some
way
later
that
evening
jon
carver
sat
for
nearly
an
hour
studying
intently
from
one
of
his
reelbooks
and
the
frown
on
his
face
grew
deeper
and
deeper
jak
had
been
working
over
their
father
he
had
given
him
a
careful
sponge
bath
then
fed
him
another
intravenous
dosage
of
the
combined
liquid
protein
salt
sugar
and
glucose
even
though
their
mother
had
been
able
to
her
husband
small
amounts
of
food
each
day
the
young
doctor
felt
additional
nourishment
was
necessary
when
he
finished
his
task
and
started
to
seek
a
comfortable
seat
in
the
living
quarters
of
the
space
yacht
to
relax
with
a
little
reading
of
his
own
he
noticed
his
brother
intent
look
and
worried
face
what
the
matter
jon
eh
the
younger
boy
looked
up
startled
from
his
deep
study
then
as
jak
repeated
the
question
he
answered
unhappily
i
just
do
know
enough
owl
i
ca
figure
out
why
pop
found
such
strong
spectroscopic
lines
of
that
new
element
while
we
were
billions
of
miles
away
and
yet
we
ca
find
any
traces
of
it
anywhere
on
these
planets
except
what
we
found
in
that
cache
maybe
it
in
the
sun
i
tried
that
when
we
were
out
there
but
did
even
peep
the
elder
brother
studied
the
problem
a
moment
could
it
be
so
strong
that
even
the
little
bit
we
found
would
have
shown
those
lines
maybe
doubtfully
but
i
do
think
so
tomorrow
morning
when
the
sun
comes
up
i
going
to
try
to
take
a
new
reading
from
here
i
tried
to
read
two
but
could
get
anything
however
i
not
so
hot
with
the
regular
spectrograph
and
that
why
i
boning
up
on
it
is
this
important
their
mother
had
laid
her
sewing
in
her
lap
to
listen
to
them
trying
to
follow
and
understand
what
her
sons
were
talking
about
pop
thought
it
was
mom
jon
explained
one
of
the
things
men
have
been
looking
for
ever
since
they
first
started
dreaming
of
rockets
and
spaceships
was
the
best
possible
fuel
we
knew
the
one
we
using
now
is
the
ultimate
but
it
the
best
they
been
able
to
get
so
far
pop
thought
perhaps
this
new
stuff
might
be
it
we
could
find
it
and
we
could
learn
how
to
use
it
why
ca
we
use
it
if
you
find
it
jak
wanted
to
know
there
are
so
many
problems
maybe
it
would
be
so
radioactive
we
would
be
able
to
handle
it
or
keep
it
in
the
storage
bins
without
endangering
the
people
on
the
ship
maybe
the
exciters
and
convertors
would
handle
it
without
a
lot
of
new
experimenting
and
new
designs
we
would
have
the
scientific
or
technical
to
make
or
it
might
be
that
instead
of
getting
a
steady
stream
of
power
as
we
do
with
our
present
fuel
the
stuff
would
want
to
blow
up
all
at
once
if
the
metal
as
powerful
as
i
think
it
is
it
might
cause
an
explosion
that
would
make
man
biggest
or
look
like
a
firecracker
then
do
you
go
experimenting
with
it
and
blow
us
all
up
his
mother
said
sharply
jon
grinned
at
her
you
need
worry
about
that
mom
now
that
had
a
chance
to
learn
how
little
i
know
although
i
would
gone
off
that
day
you
stopped
me
for
which
i
grateful
even
though
i
was
sore
at
you
for
a
while
then
but
i
sure
going
to
study
it
as
soon
as
we
get
the
other
markers
set
and
can
get
back
to
two
by
that
time
father
will
be
well
again
jak
said
is
it
wonderful
that
he
really
is
coming
around
all
right
seems
to
be
taking
an
awful
long
time
for
him
to
recover
fully
though
i
sure
he
be
his
own
keen
self
again
soon
although
he
have
to
stay
in
bed
until
that
leg
is
strong
enough
to
stand
on
again
well
let
hit
the
sack
so
we
can
get
a
good
start
in
the
morning
mom
during
their
journeys
over
the
surface
of
planet
three
the
boys
conscientiously
tended
the
machines
and
recorders
that
gave
them
the
data
on
land
and
water
conditions
the
proportions
of
each
the
approximate
amounts
of
metallic
ores
their
analyzers
showed
the
information
on
weather
temperature
and
humidity
they
took
numerous
pictures
as
required
by
law
their
mother
often
helping
in
this
after
jak
had
taught
her
how
to
operate
the
cameras
these
pictures
jak
developed
and
printed
as
he
had
time
and
mounted
them
in
their
data
book
for
the
colonial
board
to
study
when
they
got
back
they
also
mapped
and
recorded
the
size
and
distances
of
three
two
moons
jak
named
these
zinnia
and
begonia
much
to
jon
sarcastic
and
derision
this
make
a
swell
home
for
people
who
like
cold
weather
jak
tried
to
change
the
subject
yes
just
as
two
will
for
those
who
like
it
hotter
jon
eyes
shone
pop
sure
picked
a
winner
when
he
decided
to
explore
this
system
even
with
just
these
two
worlds
he
has
a
prize
they
accept
our
work
as
proof
wonder
what
the
fourth
planet
will
be
like
jak
continued
in
a
different
tone
cold
lots
colder
probably
than
mars
then
it
wo
do
us
any
good
depends
on
what
on
it
in
the
way
of
metals
that
can
be
mined
maybe
we
find
something
there
might
be
natural
gems
or
jewels
too
and
anyway
cold
never
stopped
man
that
right
jon
said
admiringly
they
have
mines
on
pluto
even
although
they
mostly
worked
by
automatics
while
the
men
stay
warm
in
their
as
the
approached
closer
to
the
distant
smaller
planet
they
had
named
jon
their
instruments
showed
it
to
have
a
diameter
of
about
miles
and
a
density
of
about
a
little
lighter
than
terra
this
meant
the
gravity
would
be
a
bit
weaker
and
they
would
weigh
less
than
on
their
home
planet
four
was
almost
a
quarter
of
a
billion
miles
from
the
sun
and
would
be
very
cold
as
jon
had
said
while
their
ship
drove
in
closer
the
boys
mother
came
into
the
control
room
all
three
carvers
stared
excitedly
into
their
visiplates
watching
their
rapid
approach
to
this
new
world
would
they
find
anything
of
value
there
or
was
it
simply
a
barren
wasteland
of
ice
and
frozen
air
and
rocks
far
too
cold
and
forbidding
for
men
even
to
bother
trying
to
explore
it
when
jak
eyes
still
glued
to
the
telescopic
sights
of
his
voiced
something
of
this
jon
drawled
you
know
better
than
that
owl
we
said
just
yesterday
that
there
no
place
no
matter
how
bad
that
man
wo
explore
to
see
if
there
anything
he
can
possibly
use
they
follow
us
here
do
worry
after
cruising
about
the
surface
for
some
time
recording
their
data
and
taking
the
needed
pictures
they
saw
a
fairly
level
valley
and
bare
and
jon
set
the
ship
down
there
by
now
he
was
becoming
an
expert
astrogator
and
pilot
and
with
his
new
controls
they
could
hardly
feel
the
jar
of
the
ship
landing
how
the
temp
outside
jak
was
examining
the
gauges
about
a
hundred
below
and
not
a
bit
of
moisture
naturally
going
to
try
going
out
i
do
their
mother
started
to
speak
against
it
but
made
herself
stop
her
boys
were
showing
such
resourcefulness
and
unexpected
habits
of
caution
that
she
felt
she
must
let
them
decide
things
for
themselves
even
though
her
motherly
instinct
was
always
to
hold
them
back
from
possible
dangers
sure
we
going
out
for
a
bit
jon
answered
his
brother
then
faced
their
mother
it
be
all
ok
mom
he
said
affectionately
we
wear
our
suits
of
course
with
the
heaters
on
we
wo
go
far
because
the
moment
we
feel
any
cold
we
run
back
but
i
want
to
see
what
it
like
out
there
and
if
there
any
sort
of
life
supposed
to
report
life
here
incredulously
it
was
jak
who
answered
this
sure
mother
there
can
be
anywhere
oh
not
necessarily
nor
even
probably
anything
we
know
on
terra
but
there
should
be
some
sort
of
moss
or
lichen
in
the
plant
line
yes
it
has
been
learned
from
experience
there
some
sort
of
life
almost
everywhere
jon
chimed
in
even
though
most
of
it
so
different
from
the
basic
we
used
to
that
it
hard
to
realize
it
really
life
at
all
jak
continued
but
then
remember
back
on
terra
the
vast
difference
between
animal
and
vegetable
life
so
totally
unlike
each
other
i
second
jon
plan
to
go
out
i
really
like
to
see
what
out
there
she
sighed
as
if
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
these
boys
of
hers
were
fast
becoming
reliable
men
they
were
not
her
babies
any
more
she
was
proud
of
course
but
she
could
resist
the
motherly
impulse
to
warn
well
be
careful
anyway
sure
we
will
jon
locked
all
the
controls
in
neutral
and
the
two
boys
went
to
put
on
their
suits
knowing
as
they
did
the
vital
necessity
of
making
sure
they
were
tight
and
fully
equipped
they
examined
and
inspected
their
own
and
each
other
spacesuits
carefully
before
they
opened
the
inner
lockdoor
once
outside
they
stood
on
the
icy
ground
for
several
minutes
to
make
sure
their
heaters
were
working
capably
enough
to
keep
them
and
especially
their
feet
warm
finding
they
were
as
completely
comfortable
as
anyone
ever
can
be
inside
that
sort
of
a
suit
they
started
off
across
the
frozen
plain
headed
for
the
hills
on
the
side
of
the
valley
closest
to
the
ship
jak
examined
the
ground
about
them
intently
as
they
walked
hoping
to
find
some
sort
of
plant
life
while
jon
kept
his
eyes
mostly
on
the
portable
analyzer
he
carried
hoping
they
might
discover
valuable
deposits
of
inorganics
was
there
any
of
that
unknown
here
he
wondered
anxiously
their
big
analyzer
had
not
shown
it
as
they
were
coming
in
on
the
survey
or
landing
spiral
but
that
did
not
necessarily
mean
the
portable
would
show
it
on
closer
approach
or
that
there
might
not
be
some
on
a
portion
of
the
surface
they
had
not
yet
covered
from
above
their
trips
about
and
above
the
surface
had
however
shown
traces
of
iron
manganese
gold
silver
copper
and
several
other
metals
although
not
strongly
enough
to
indicate
great
deposits
but
jon
knew
experience
had
shown
over
the
years
that
one
of
the
inefficiencies
of
such
analyzers
was
that
they
would
not
show
the
of
a
deposit
many
times
when
only
a
slight
trace
had
been
detected
while
flying
above
the
surface
prospectors
on
the
ground
had
found
veritable
bonanzas
once
they
started
mining
even
though
the
gravity
was
about
eight
per
cent
lighter
than
on
terra
the
boys
found
walking
not
too
easy
the
terrain
was
mostly
rough
although
there
were
many
spots
of
slick
glare
ice
too
there
were
many
hillocks
and
cracks
and
crevasses
between
the
slippery
places
so
even
though
they
had
added
caulks
to
their
metallic
walking
was
unsafe
and
hard
by
the
time
they
reached
the
base
of
the
first
low
hills
they
were
winded
and
glad
to
rest
a
few
minutes
not
a
thing
so
far
jak
panted
into
his
i
ca
see
even
a
bit
of
color
just
this
white
glare
has
let
out
a
peep
either
guess
this
is
a
dead
all
right
at
least
this
district
looks
it
let
climb
a
ways
and
if
we
do
find
anything
there
go
back
to
the
ship
and
try
somewhere
else
i
buy
a
chunk
of
that
they
started
up
the
hill
before
them
the
climbing
was
difficult
because
of
the
ice
and
because
in
most
places
the
side
of
the
hill
was
not
a
gradual
slope
but
a
starkly
steep
climb
it
was
evident
there
had
been
no
gradual
weathering
here
to
produce
rounded
edges
and
rolling
slopes
although
there
were
occasional
smooth
places
these
though
the
boys
knew
could
not
be
climbed
at
all
without
special
equipment
which
they
did
not
carry
this
is
ice
is
it
jon
asked
as
they
panted
upward
no
silly
there
can
be
no
water
vapor
here
any
more
than
there
is
on
neptune
or
pluto
back
home
this
is
mostly
frozen
carbon
dioxide
well
it
just
as
cold
and
just
as
hard
to
climb
as
polar
ice
they
climbed
the
quarter
mile
to
the
crest
of
the
first
hill
and
peered
eagerly
over
its
top
in
front
and
slightly
below
was
another
valley
not
as
deep
as
the
one
in
which
their
ship
lay
but
even
larger
from
their
higher
position
the
floor
of
this
new
valley
seemed
quite
smooth
but
that
can
be
just
an
optical
illusion
jak
answered
statement
adding
the
glare
of
white
would
make
it
look
smoother
from
a
height
jon
ignored
the
tone
of
superiority
good
thing
our
suits
have
tinted
lenses
do
we
go
down
natch
jak
had
already
started
off
there
to
the
right
and
part
way
down
are
some
darker
places
i
want
to
look
at
them
could
lichens
grow
here
some
could
possibly
though
not
exactly
like
the
kind
we
find
on
earth
if
there
life
here
it
probably
a
type
that
can
convert
energy
directly
from
the
elements
in
the
ground
or
ice
instead
of
using
or
other
methods
of
obtaining
nourishment
we
know
about
they
made
their
difficult
way
to
the
little
patch
of
which
jak
examined
with
growing
delight
hey
that
gneiss
what
nice
about
oh
jon
grew
at
having
been
caught
that
way
you
and
your
education
he
snorted
see
how
brittle
it
is
jak
ignored
the
interruption
as
he
touched
a
stem
only
to
have
it
snap
off
like
a
slim
glass
fibre
ca
tell
without
a
more
thorough
microscopic
examination
but
i
bet
this
is
some
sort
of
life
crystalline
instead
of
being
like
the
gneissic
rocks
back
home
jon
meanwhile
had
been
surveying
the
valley
with
his
binoculars
suddenly
he
gave
a
gasp
and
focussed
his
glasses
more
steadily
on
something
that
had
caught
his
eye
for
some
minutes
he
studied
it
then
called
excitedly
hey
owl
give
a
look
over
there
see
beside
that
spire
of
rock
he
pointed
as
his
brother
rose
and
unlimbered
his
own
pair
of
binoculars
movement
of
some
sort
there
though
it
very
very
slow
on
that
sort
of
pyramid
a
yard
or
so
high
for
long
moments
the
two
studied
the
spot
through
their
glasses
then
jak
said
slowly
but
with
mounting
excitement
i
think
you
right
chubby
and
that
we
got
to
see
in
their
excitement
the
two
started
off
faster
and
more
carelessly
than
was
safe
they
found
out
that
fact
when
both
almost
at
the
same
time
lost
their
footing
and
fell
coasting
down
the
remainder
of
the
hill
faster
and
faster
they
slid
shaken
and
becoming
bruised
although
luckily
neither
broke
any
bones
at
the
bottom
they
picked
themselves
up
and
started
on
again
both
walked
more
gingerly
now
and
jak
limped
a
bit
from
a
twisted
ankle
yet
they
were
so
eager
to
see
what
this
strange
movement
might
be
they
soon
forgot
their
bruises
and
hurried
once
more
it
was
a
good
half
mile
across
the
valley
floor
to
their
destination
but
there
sure
enough
they
found
strange
unearthly
life
it
was
but
they
soon
discovered
that
it
had
reproduction
growth
and
movement
the
three
main
criteria
of
crystalline
by
golly
jon
yelled
jak
was
squatting
beside
the
growing
thing
it
was
somewhat
pyramidal
yet
the
sides
were
not
smooth
rather
they
were
like
the
pieces
of
rock
crystal
with
which
the
boys
were
familiar
it
was
a
color
with
just
enough
of
the
gray
in
it
so
it
had
been
visible
from
a
distance
against
the
white
background
but
now
as
the
boys
were
on
the
sunward
side
of
one
of
the
pyramids
for
there
were
many
of
them
about
they
could
see
that
the
light
reflected
from
it
was
kaleidoscopic
coloration
at
times
jak
reached
out
a
gloved
hand
and
rapped
on
the
pyramid
and
it
gave
forth
a
tinkling
sound
then
collapsed
into
a
thousand
tiny
shards
you
you
broke
it
yes
i
sorry
i
did
mean
to
kill
it
had
no
idea
it
was
so
fragile
jak
rose
moved
over
to
another
pyramid
and
squatted
beside
it
examining
it
closely
but
careful
not
to
touch
it
jon
sank
onto
his
heels
beside
him
for
a
few
seconds
as
they
watched
there
was
no
change
but
suddenly
they
heard
a
small
clear
and
a
new
crystal
sprang
into
existence
near
the
base
almost
at
once
there
was
a
repetition
of
the
sound
and
another
appeared
further
up
on
the
adjoining
side
of
the
structure
or
creature
as
the
boys
continued
watching
this
was
repeated
over
and
over
with
each
tiny
sound
a
new
facet
came
into
being
somewhere
on
the
pyramid
before
their
very
eyes
the
was
growing
boy
that
something
jon
exclaimed
admiringly
yes
it
a
all
right
jak
said
more
seriously
without
taking
his
eyes
from
it
it
all
new
to
us
but
i
bet
silicon
of
some
sort
beneath
this
ice
and
that
this
thing
gets
its
nourishment
from
that
what
makes
it
keep
growing
what
makes
a
man
or
an
animal
or
plant
grow
when
it
eats
oh
then
do
you
suppose
it
has
any
mentality
jak
was
silent
a
moment
mulling
that
over
then
he
looked
at
his
brother
a
crease
of
concentration
on
his
forehead
i
feel
quite
sure
that
it
probably
has
but
of
a
sort
we
would
be
able
to
understand
even
if
we
could
get
in
contact
with
its
even
reading
that
i
doubt
very
much
if
we
be
able
to
understand
its
way
of
thinking
reasoning
or
the
motivations
by
which
it
lives
he
went
back
to
studying
the
strange
crystallization
probably
you
right
jon
agreed
after
some
thought
a
moment
later
he
asked
is
it
good
for
anything
i
mean
can
man
use
it
for
something
jak
wrenched
his
gaze
away
from
that
astounding
growth
to
look
up
in
shocked
disgust
is
that
all
you
think
about
in
the
face
of
such
a
marvel
as
this
whether
it
worth
anything
or
not
here
we
found
an
entirely
new
type
of
life
and
hey
keep
your
suit
tight
owl
we
have
to
report
this
you
know
and
i
just
trying
to
find
out
what
to
write
down
oh
jak
spoke
slowly
his
voice
now
admitting
the
lightness
of
that
point
of
view
i
ca
offhand
see
any
practical
value
especially
considering
how
easily
these
crystals
are
broken
but
i
know
geologists
and
possibly
chemists
will
be
intensely
interested
in
studying
them
there
a
lot
they
can
learn
here
i
sure
naturally
report
all
that
you
right
and
the
location
of
this
valley
think
they
may
occur
all
over
the
planet
no
telling
but
probably
if
they
can
find
the
right
sort
of
soil
nourishment
we
did
see
any
while
coming
down
but
they
been
there
and
we
missed
them
not
expecting
anything
like
this
we
did
see
any
other
either
that
we
could
recognize
maybe
these
the
dominant
species
here
jak
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
all
about
him
there
were
hundreds
of
the
pyramids
to
be
seen
some
towering
a
dozen
or
more
feet
high
and
as
large
across
each
base
line
others
very
small
babies
he
thought
with
a
grin
again
he
watched
one
of
the
smaller
ones
intently
noticing
how
it
grew
jon
walked
about
looking
at
the
different
structures
of
that
mysterious
growing
crystal
suddenly
he
stiffened
straining
listening
then
he
called
hey
jak
you
hear
anything
huh
his
brother
tore
his
gaze
from
the
crystallization
he
was
watching
hear
what
turn
up
the
power
of
your
suit
receiver
there
there
it
is
again
hey
sounds
like
our
siren
yes
i
heard
it
then
mother
must
be
in
trouble
or
something
jak
last
words
were
flung
back
across
his
shoulder
as
he
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
across
the
icy
wastes
of
the
valley
floor
nor
was
jon
far
behind
in
fact
after
a
few
strides
the
younger
but
boy
was
beside
him
then
forged
ahead
hurry
owl
mom
would
signal
unless
it
was
urgent
maybe
father
worse
they
tried
to
conserve
their
breath
after
that
for
running
and
climbing
once
jon
broke
the
silence
turn
your
oxygen
a
little
higher
jak
he
said
as
he
twisted
the
small
lever
at
his
own
shoulder
to
increase
the
flow
of
the
energy
they
were
panting
and
winded
by
the
time
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
but
they
disregarded
fatigue
in
the
face
of
their
probable
danger
or
their
father
jon
looked
quickly
to
one
side
and
then
the
other
as
jak
topped
the
ridge
he
saw
his
brother
run
some
twenty
feet
or
so
to
where
he
had
spotted
a
fairly
smooth
downward
slope
down
this
the
younger
boy
launched
himself
feet
first
sliding
on
his
suit
back
jak
instantly
realized
the
reason
and
threw
himself
after
his
brother
in
less
than
a
tenth
of
the
time
it
would
have
taken
them
to
climb
down
the
boys
were
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
they
struggled
to
their
feet
and
started
off
toward
the
ship
both
were
again
shaken
and
sorely
bruised
from
their
rough
slide
but
they
trotted
on
mother
had
called
nothing
else
mattered
as
they
came
closer
to
the
ship
they
saw
her
reason
for
summoning
them
all
about
the
outer
lockdoor
were
those
strange
crystalline
structures
growing
swiftly
as
the
two
boys
came
still
closer
they
could
see
that
streamers
of
the
crystals
had
already
reached
the
lower
edge
and
were
trying
to
force
their
way
through
the
almost
imperceptible
crack
they
never
get
through
there
jon
panted
as
he
raced
the
last
few
feet
do
see
how
they
can
but
watch
jak
waded
into
the
alien
growing
things
his
gloved
fists
smashed
right
and
left
as
he
spoke
jon
was
already
doing
the
same
but
whether
these
were
of
a
different
type
from
those
that
jak
had
broken
in
the
distant
valley
or
just
what
was
the
reason
the
boys
now
found
it
more
difficult
to
break
these
crystals
down
these
are
like
those
back
there
jon
had
now
seen
that
these
crystals
did
not
always
grow
in
pyramidal
shape
no
they
grow
new
crystals
wherever
needed
jak
had
been
concentrating
on
the
tendrils
or
chains
of
crystals
that
were
reaching
always
reaching
toward
the
lockdoor
while
jon
had
been
trying
to
break
the
bases
of
the
pyramids
from
which
these
arms
sprang
although
the
crystals
were
still
fairly
easy
to
break
especially
the
tentacles
which
were
only
a
thin
string
new
ones
replaced
them
so
swiftly
and
their
numbers
increased
so
constantly
that
it
seemed
almost
a
losing
battle
these
growing
lots
faster
than
the
others
jon
gritted
his
teeth
as
he
now
tried
crushing
the
bases
with
his
heavy
metallic
boots
hoping
thus
to
make
it
harder
for
the
to
reach
the
door
for
minutes
the
two
boys
fought
in
desperation
then
jon
grunted
in
disgust
at
his
thoughtlessness
and
yanked
out
his
never
thought
of
this
he
yelled
as
he
trained
it
on
the
the
terrifically
hot
flame
washed
off
them
in
coruscating
showers
but
did
no
damage
try
bullets
jak
unlimbered
his
gun
from
his
back
and
started
firing
it
into
the
base
of
the
crystals
nearest
the
lockdoor
the
heavy
bullets
shattered
the
crystals
easily
and
soon
the
boys
could
begin
to
see
that
they
were
clearing
the
way
you
keep
firing
while
i
open
the
door
and
climb
in
jon
yelled
then
you
climb
in
while
i
going
to
the
control
room
and
i
lift
ship
right
jak
replied
and
fired
even
faster
as
jon
touched
the
outer
that
opened
the
lock
hardly
had
it
begun
opening
however
than
they
heard
the
sound
of
another
gun
being
fired
through
the
opening
they
looked
up
in
surprise
and
saw
it
was
their
mother
shooting
a
shotgun
jon
scrambled
up
into
the
lock
good
work
mom
but
get
back
in
i
lifting
ship
he
dashed
through
the
inner
doorway
and
into
the
control
room
he
threw
the
switch
and
shuddered
as
its
tubes
roared
into
life
jon
punched
on
the
intercom
visiplate
that
scanned
the
interior
of
the
lock
and
saw
his
mother
pulling
jak
into
the
ship
then
closing
the
outer
door
quickly
jon
put
the
ship
into
a
slow
cruising
orbit
and
switched
on
the
remembering
the
open
doors
and
the
bitter
outside
cold
he
glanced
to
see
that
the
automatic
heaters
were
taking
care
of
the
inside
temperature
then
ran
back
toward
the
lock
there
he
found
his
brother
desperately
trying
to
warm
their
unsuited
body
now
growing
blue
from
that
terrible
cold
help
me
carry
her
into
bed
jak
rose
and
grasped
her
arms
but
jon
pushed
him
aside
stooping
he
picked
her
up
bodily
he
ran
staggering
a
bit
with
her
into
the
bunkroom
jak
was
right
behind
and
pulled
some
extra
blankets
from
a
drawer
then
while
he
was
piling
covers
about
her
jon
dashed
into
the
galley
he
drew
hot
water
from
the
tap
and
quickly
made
a
cupful
of
instant
tea
then
ran
back
with
it
to
the
bunkroom
some
minutes
later
they
saw
with
satisfaction
that
their
mother
color
was
growing
more
natural
and
her
body
tremors
were
slowing
from
the
combined
warmth
of
the
extra
blankets
and
hot
drink
only
then
did
the
boys
stop
to
help
each
other
out
of
their
suits
thanks
for
the
help
mother
but
do
you
know
enough
to
wear
a
suit
in
weather
as
cold
as
this
jak
worry
made
his
voice
sharp
yes
who
always
fussing
about
us
being
careful
jon
added
then
pull
a
stunt
like
this
their
mother
looked
up
at
them
and
the
old
impish
grin
they
had
seen
so
seldom
of
late
came
onto
her
face
you
got
me
chums
she
drawled
from
now
on
i
reckon
i
keep
my
big
mouth
shut
jon
howled
and
jak
added
in
the
same
sort
of
drawl
well
now
i
would
go
for
to
say
it
was
and
ducked
as
she
slapped
out
at
him
soon
the
two
boys
sobered
down
we
better
go
examine
the
lock
and
make
sure
no
crystals
got
in
jak
said
yow
i
forgot
about
that
jon
sprang
forward
we
sure
do
want
any
of
them
in
or
on
the
ship
despite
jon
desire
to
get
away
from
this
unfriendly
world
that
bore
his
name
he
was
careful
to
see
that
the
was
set
out
and
functioning
and
that
the
ship
log
contained
as
complete
a
record
of
the
resources
and
data
on
the
planet
as
was
required
by
the
terran
colonial
board
the
same
was
true
of
four
four
moons
jak
checked
all
the
work
nor
did
they
leave
four
until
both
boys
were
satisfied
it
was
complete
their
mother
was
a
great
help
in
taking
the
numerous
photographs
needed
having
become
quite
competent
in
handling
the
cameras
she
was
so
relieved
at
the
steady
progress
of
her
convalescence
that
she
put
extra
enthusiasm
into
her
photography
the
family
still
felt
that
mr
carver
should
be
kept
as
quiet
as
possible
and
away
from
any
mental
strain
in
connection
with
the
ship
and
the
planet
mapping
and
in
his
weakness
he
seemed
content
to
leave
it
that
way
for
the
time
being
he
asked
few
questions
and
accepted
the
reassuring
answers
contentedly
nor
even
though
jon
wished
to
get
back
to
friendly
two
as
soon
as
he
could
did
he
forget
they
still
had
to
visit
planet
five
and
scout
and
record
that
so
as
soon
as
they
were
completely
done
on
four
he
lost
no
time
setting
course
for
five
once
on
the
way
he
announced
his
names
for
the
four
moons
of
four
and
now
it
was
jak
turn
to
scoff
well
if
you
can
name
yours
after
flowers
i
do
see
why
you
got
any
kick
coming
because
i
name
mine
after
fish
jon
asserted
i
leave
it
to
you
mom
are
tuna
betta
sturgeon
and
porpoise
nice
names
i
think
they
are
fine
just
as
i
think
zinnia
and
begonia
are
aptly
named
she
said
diplomatically
the
two
boys
made
faces
at
each
other
then
jon
turned
back
to
his
computations
i
not
as
good
at
figuring
these
things
out
as
pop
is
but
i
think
five
is
about
a
half
billion
miles
from
the
sun
almost
three
hundred
and
fifty
million
miles
from
here
since
further
around
the
sun
but
we
cut
across
on
a
direct
route
to
his
surprise
jak
came
up
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
doing
a
grand
job
of
astrogating
chubby
i
really
proud
of
you
his
voice
was
sincere
and
appreciative
yes
their
mother
came
over
and
kissed
jon
rumpling
his
hair
affectionately
i
been
unexpectedly
relieved
that
you
managed
to
get
us
to
each
world
so
surely
and
to
land
us
so
gently
though
maybe
i
should
have
been
so
surprised
at
that
she
laughed
gaily
as
her
younger
son
flushed
from
this
unexpected
praise
aw
you
guys
are
just
saying
that
because
i
so
wonderful
jon
tried
to
joke
but
they
could
tell
how
deeply
he
felt
their
compliments
a
day
later
when
jon
announced
they
were
approaching
this
outermost
planet
the
other
two
joined
him
in
the
control
room
and
all
were
soon
deeply
engrossed
in
the
sight
revealed
to
them
in
their
visiplates
an
hour
or
so
later
jon
was
examining
their
when
he
let
out
a
yelp
of
excitement
hey
that
showing
up
it
must
come
from
five
and
a
moment
later
listen
to
rattle
it
sure
is
there
but
plenty
they
clustered
about
him
and
even
though
they
could
not
tell
anything
from
the
lines
on
the
spectrograph
that
he
pointed
out
they
could
hear
the
machine
chattering
and
they
grew
excited
from
his
exultation
miners
can
use
the
same
type
of
automatics
they
use
on
pluto
to
get
it
ca
they
jak
asked
i
imagine
so
although
i
really
do
know
anything
about
it
however
if
we
find
we
can
use
it
there
where
they
can
get
it
and
that
the
important
thing
their
plates
again
showed
only
the
blinding
whiteness
of
ice
they
knew
was
frozen
carbon
dioxide
rather
than
frozen
water
or
snow
for
even
more
than
on
four
there
could
be
no
water
here
even
in
its
most
frozen
form
they
cruised
about
above
the
surface
watching
their
instruments
to
find
and
record
any
metallic
ore
deposits
especially
the
new
one
the
terrain
was
so
forbidding
so
desolate
that
even
the
irrepressible
jon
felt
no
desire
to
land
on
it
or
to
go
outside
again
their
mother
took
most
of
the
needed
photographs
while
the
boys
recorded
all
the
other
data
of
geography
size
and
conditions
generally
finally
jon
set
the
ship
down
on
a
fairly
level
plateau
close
to
what
they
figured
was
the
equator
well
here
we
are
and
that
all
i
care
about
jon
announced
with
a
shiver
we
use
the
distant
hands
to
put
out
the
marker
then
see
if
we
can
find
the
location
of
that
fuel
deposit
jak
agreed
i
would
go
out
there
for
a
million
credits
he
shuddered
as
he
looked
out
the
port
while
the
others
crowded
about
to
view
that
forbidding
scene
maybe
we
should
but
i
sure
would
get
any
fun
out
of
it
doubt
if
our
suits
would
be
able
to
keep
us
warm
even
with
the
heaters
at
max
no
their
mother
said
sharply
although
they
could
detect
the
relief
in
her
voice
that
they
had
already
made
the
decision
this
is
one
time
i
would
have
set
my
foot
down
and
not
allowed
it
this
place
gives
me
the
creeps
while
jon
was
making
up
the
tape
jak
carried
a
into
the
lock
and
placed
it
beneath
those
distant
hands
jon
came
in
and
installed
the
tape
then
started
the
mechanism
running
they
returned
to
the
control
room
and
jak
whistling
unmelodiously
between
his
teeth
operated
the
controls
that
opened
the
outer
door
then
used
the
lifting
to
set
the
outside
on
the
icy
ground
when
the
outer
door
was
closed
he
nodded
to
jon
and
the
latter
lifted
the
ship
again
i
going
up
a
couple
of
miles
then
circle
about
to
look
for
deposits
of
that
fuel
metal
meanwhile
as
we
go
we
can
get
the
rest
of
our
dope
and
then
scoot
out
of
here
jak
again
took
his
place
at
the
recorders
while
his
mother
was
at
the
cameras
jon
set
the
ship
into
a
quartering
circle
and
when
he
had
located
the
direction
in
which
the
analyzer
showed
the
strongest
indications
of
the
enigmatic
metal
swung
into
that
course
they
had
gone
less
than
five
hundred
miles
when
they
noticed
a
reddish
glow
in
the
distance
as
they
came
closer
they
saw
that
ahead
and
below
was
a
terrific
whirling
mass
of
colored
gas
wow
look
at
that
storm
jak
yelled
but
he
could
not
help
adding
did
you
ever
see
anything
more
beautiful
better
get
well
above
it
had
you
mrs
carver
asked
anxiously
it
looks
dangerous
i
sure
not
going
through
it
jon
was
already
lifting
the
ship
but
says
the
stuffs
right
close
at
five
miles
high
he
leveled
off
and
put
the
ship
into
a
narrowing
spiral
from
that
vantage
point
they
could
see
that
the
storm
was
a
purely
localized
affair
perhaps
some
twenty
miles
in
diameter
wonder
what
makes
those
colors
jak
called
from
the
into
which
he
was
staring
suppose
it
could
be
a
volcano
could
there
be
volcanic
action
on
so
cold
a
planet
their
mother
asked
in
astonishment
i
do
see
how
there
could
be
jak
answered
slowly
but
that
certainly
looks
like
flames
of
some
sort
down
there
maybe
the
experts
from
terra
can
figure
it
out
from
our
color
pictures
mrs
carver
said
i
taking
a
lot
of
extra
ones
with
the
variable
focus
lens
that
new
metal
down
there
though
whatever
it
is
since
those
other
people
mined
it
our
miners
figure
out
how
to
get
it
too
i
bet
i
wonder
jak
was
suddenly
diffident
do
laugh
now
but
do
you
suppose
maybe
those
flames
could
be
some
sort
of
life
and
that
feeding
on
the
metal
which
you
said
was
highly
radioactive
now
who
nutty
jon
asked
witheringly
while
mrs
carver
gasped
at
the
daring
concept
well
some
of
those
flames
are
coming
higher
and
aiming
for
us
jak
tried
to
defend
his
position
we
have
said
such
as
we
found
on
four
were
impossible
but
we
know
they
are
and
that
they
have
some
sort
of
well
intelligence
from
the
way
they
tried
to
get
our
ship
so
why
not
do
you
think
they
dangerous
their
mother
voice
held
a
frightened
note
as
she
saw
in
her
plate
those
swiftly
approaching
flames
do
see
how
they
could
possibly
hurt
the
ship
or
us
jon
tried
to
speak
calmly
but
he
tilted
the
nose
and
the
was
soon
nearly
ten
miles
high
although
it
still
continued
circling
man
oh
man
they
certainly
beautiful
jak
was
enthralled
as
those
bright
shining
tongues
of
flame
grew
taller
and
taller
there
there
does
seem
to
be
a
a
purpose
in
the
way
they
act
though
his
tone
changed
to
a
more
anxious
one
the
flames
were
now
high
above
the
storm
of
fire
that
constituted
the
main
body
now
these
tongues
broke
loose
and
as
they
continued
rising
toward
the
ship
they
became
more
spherical
in
shape
were
no
longer
simply
extensions
of
the
fires
and
as
they
rose
ever
higher
and
faster
they
seemed
to
the
anxious
watchers
to
be
really
thinking
intelligent
entities
let
move
away
from
here
their
mother
pleaded
i
getting
the
feeling
that
they
are
actually
pursuing
us
and
for
no
good
purpose
either
jon
touched
the
controls
and
the
ship
began
rising
more
swiftly
no
do
leave
i
want
to
study
jak
began
but
jon
interrupted
him
so
would
i
like
to
know
more
about
them
but
if
mom
wants
to
leave
away
we
go
yet
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
relief
in
his
voice
but
as
if
guessing
his
intention
the
flames
hurtled
after
them
at
such
tremendous
speed
that
before
the
ship
had
barely
begun
accelerating
they
were
almost
up
to
it
hang
on
tight
jon
yelled
and
increased
the
acceleration
soon
the
ship
had
left
the
flames
behind
peering
in
their
telescopic
plates
the
three
could
see
the
flames
reluctantly
and
as
if
baffled
return
at
last
to
their
home
below
all
gone
mother
we
safe
now
jak
said
comfortingly
thank
you
god
she
said
devoutly
and
sank
limply
into
a
seat
i
was
afraid
for
awhile
so
was
i
jon
teeth
began
chattering
and
his
body
shaking
so
hard
that
he
too
was
glad
he
was
sitting
down
now
that
it
was
all
over
the
shock
of
that
strangeness
that
utter
alienness
was
hitting
him
nor
was
jak
in
much
better
shape
in
spite
of
his
expressed
desire
to
stay
and
study
the
enigmatic
it
was
many
minutes
before
the
trio
were
able
to
discuss
the
matter
calmly
and
to
realize
they
had
been
in
actual
danger
i
see
now
we
sure
would
have
been
if
jon
had
zoomed
us
out
of
there
so
fast
jak
said
finally
mrs
carver
shook
herself
i
go
get
lunch
it
must
be
time
hungry
as
i
feel
me
too
jon
laughed
but
then
i
always
hungry
as
soon
as
the
three
had
finished
eating
mrs
carver
and
jak
went
to
sit
with
the
invalid
and
watch
hopefully
for
those
moments
which
were
becoming
more
and
more
frequent
jon
went
back
to
check
his
course
back
to
planet
two
and
to
lounge
later
in
the
seat
studying
from
one
of
his
reelbooks
there
must
be
he
told
himself
some
way
of
handling
that
fuel
and
of
storing
and
using
it
the
fact
that
it
was
cached
there
on
two
shows
that
but
then
those
folks
who
used
it
were
so
evidently
far
advanced
in
science
a
bit
later
the
thought
intruded
hey
if
that
stuff
so
powerful
now
after
all
the
untold
time
it
was
stored
there
what
was
it
like
when
it
was
new
an
hour
or
so
later
he
heard
his
name
called
urgently
he
sprang
up
and
ran
into
the
other
room
to
see
his
brother
beckoning
him
from
the
doorway
of
their
parents
bunkroom
as
he
came
up
jon
saw
his
mother
inside
bending
over
the
bunk
is
is
pop
worse
he
been
so
much
better
jon
heart
was
clogging
his
speech
no
he
seems
to
be
waking
up
fully
jak
turned
a
radiant
face
toward
him
then
immediately
knelt
by
his
father
side
jon
knelt
too
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
still
figure
in
the
bed
but
even
as
he
watched
the
eyelids
slowly
fluttered
a
bit
then
a
hand
was
raised
to
the
forehead
mr
carver
head
turned
from
side
to
side
restlessly
and
then
his
eyes
opened
they
seemed
to
be
studying
each
of
the
three
watchers
in
turn
as
well
as
the
room
in
which
he
was
lying
what
the
voice
was
low
and
they
strained
to
hear
what
happened
to
me
his
wife
answered
quietly
do
you
worry
about
that
now
dear
you
were
hurt
and
have
been
unconscious
for
some
time
but
now
getting
well
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
when
you
wake
up
again
go
back
to
sleep
now
you
are
getting
stronger
that
way
mr
carver
seemed
to
be
weighing
that
advice
then
to
accept
it
all
right
he
said
with
an
affectionate
smile
he
closed
his
eyes
and
soon
the
rhythmic
breathing
told
the
three
anxious
watchers
he
was
asleep
once
more
jon
let
out
his
breath
in
a
happy
sigh
there
were
tears
of
joy
in
his
mother
eyes
jak
exclaimed
delightedly
he
getting
well
mother
in
another
day
or
so
he
be
all
right
naturally
he
not
remember
clearly
for
a
while
my
textreels
say
people
with
concussions
seldom
do
but
as
soon
as
he
gets
a
little
stronger
and
those
damaged
places
in
his
brain
completely
restore
themselves
he
will
you
see
jon
chimed
in
quickly
although
he
was
not
too
sure
of
what
he
was
saying
it
just
the
shock
like
jak
says
he
snap
out
of
it
in
a
day
or
so
she
wiped
her
eyes
on
the
corner
of
her
apron
and
smiled
tremulously
of
course
boys
i
i
guess
i
just
been
so
nervous
and
and
he
was
so
much
more
like
himself
this
time
no
wonder
jon
laid
his
hand
gently
on
her
arm
you
been
under
a
terrible
strain
too
what
with
pop
sick
and
us
boys
roaming
around
on
alien
planets
but
we
be
back
on
two
where
it
more
like
home
and
there
only
a
little
more
to
be
done
before
we
can
start
back
for
terra
anyway
we
did
and
are
doing
what
had
to
be
done
to
prove
up
pop
claim
and
we
beaten
slik
bogin
supposing
he
out
here
trying
to
cheat
us
out
of
this
system
the
boys
went
into
the
control
room
we
have
to
figure
out
where
to
lay
out
our
townsite
and
which
planet
is
best
to
put
it
on
i
vote
for
two
jak
said
after
only
a
moment
hesitation
it
seems
the
most
homelike
to
me
and
we
can
stand
the
climate
so
much
better
there
wo
have
to
work
in
suits
all
the
time
yes
that
where
i
wanted
it
too
this
is
a
funny
system
in
a
way
though
there
a
much
greater
difference
in
the
distances
between
the
planets
than
we
usually
find
why
that
ask
some
astronomer
not
me
has
something
to
do
with
sizes
and
densities
i
believe
but
i
not
sure
even
of
that
maybe
it
because
this
sun
is
larger
and
denser
than
the
others
we
studied
i
know
it
almost
a
quarter
bigger
than
sol
two
almost
as
far
away
from
this
sun
as
terra
is
from
sol
you
say
yes
earth
average
is
about
million
miles
while
two
is
about
which
accounts
for
its
warmth
then
near
as
i
can
figure
it
out
three
is
lots
closer
than
mars
yet
five
is
only
a
little
further
than
jupe
and
four
is
between
them
did
i
read
somewhere
that
sol
asteroid
belt
is
really
a
planet
some
people
think
so
but
nobody
knows
for
sure
yet
all
right
then
let
put
our
city
on
two
jak
grinned
has
the
mastermind
decided
where
to
put
it
not
the
exact
location
jon
flushed
but
grinned
back
colonial
says
it
must
be
fairly
close
to
good
water
good
soil
forests
and
mineral
deposits
however
he
sobered
and
looked
at
his
brother
appealingly
golly
owl
any
chance
of
pop
getting
entirely
well
before
we
have
to
start
it
so
that
it
would
hurt
him
to
do
brainwork
i
do
know
very
much
about
city
planning
you
know
only
the
specs
colonial
furnished
he
could
but
maybe
he
wo
i
do
know
enough
to
say
how
soon
i
been
fooled
before
thought
it
would
only
take
a
few
days
when
he
was
first
hurt
what
about
his
being
so
so
dreamy
you
mean
when
he
woke
up
just
now
that
really
nothing
to
worry
about
honestly
just
as
i
told
you
and
mother
i
looked
it
up
again
and
the
text
says
amnesiacs
often
act
that
way
just
before
they
recover
full
consciousness
jon
let
out
his
breath
in
relief
but
listen
jak
changed
back
to
the
old
subject
if
you
do
know
anything
about
city
planning
and
i
do
either
how
we
going
to
know
what
has
to
be
done
to
satisfy
the
colonial
board
it
all
in
the
papers
they
gave
us
that
have
to
be
filled
out
to
file
when
we
get
back
it
tells
how
much
area
to
cover
how
far
apart
the
streets
are
to
be
and
how
wide
and
how
to
mark
out
everything
gosh
that
sounds
like
a
complicated
deal
it
take
us
an
awful
long
time
wo
it
not
as
much
as
you
think
if
we
work
really
hard
i
figure
we
should
be
able
to
do
it
in
a
couple
of
weeks
we
just
have
to
sketch
in
the
bare
outline
not
fill
it
all
in
get
out
the
papers
then
and
we
study
them
right
with
the
various
members
of
the
carver
family
busy
with
their
studies
and
chores
it
did
not
seem
long
before
they
came
close
to
planet
two
and
jon
laid
down
his
reelbooks
to
begin
preparing
for
the
landing
he
had
started
down
through
the
atmosphere
when
jak
suddenly
roused
why
do
we
circle
around
a
bit
and
look
for
our
townsite
from
the
air
i
was
going
to
jon
said
with
a
disarming
grin
just
wanted
to
get
close
enough
to
see
well
before
i
called
you
in
to
help
me
decide
at
about
five
miles
above
the
surface
he
leveled
off
and
began
circumnavigating
the
globe
he
headed
in
the
direction
which
he
remembered
from
their
previous
visit
would
soonest
bring
them
near
the
great
ocean
but
zigzagged
from
north
to
south
as
they
proceeded
eastward
watch
for
rivers
he
said
a
fairly
large
one
that
empties
into
the
ocean
they
were
about
halfway
between
the
north
pole
and
the
equator
as
they
had
already
decided
the
climate
in
that
latitude
would
probably
be
the
most
suitably
average
in
a
few
minutes
of
traveling
they
saw
ahead
a
plain
that
looked
to
be
just
what
they
wanted
quickly
jon
maneuvered
the
ship
downward
and
soon
landed
they
were
just
a
few
miles
from
the
edge
of
the
great
ocean
at
the
mouth
of
a
large
river
of
considerable
width
and
length
and
not
far
from
an
extensive
forest
to
the
south
and
a
range
of
considerable
mountains
to
the
west
hope
the
soil
here
is
good
jon
commented
as
he
locked
the
controls
in
neutral
everything
else
seems
perfect
the
shows
minerals
fairly
close
in
those
hills
to
the
west
jak
was
eagerly
peering
from
the
port
i
know
that
why
i
chose
this
spot
nice
flat
land
here
good
river
close
to
the
ocean
mountains
less
than
a
hundred
miles
away
and
not
too
high
ideal
place
i
say
that
it
is
that
it
is
going
out
today
why
not
nearly
four
hours
till
sundown
we
can
start
planning
today
then
get
busy
in
the
morning
their
mother
came
in
just
then
i
thought
it
felt
like
we
had
landed
what
are
you
going
to
do
here
she
glanced
out
of
the
port
we
have
to
lay
out
a
townsite
jon
answered
and
at
her
astonished
look
he
explained
she
shook
her
head
admiringly
and
with
surprise
you
boys
continually
amaze
me
you
seem
able
to
do
anything
jon
shrugged
that
off
when
a
thing
has
to
be
done
a
fellow
usually
can
figure
out
some
way
of
doing
it
besides
jak
grinned
we
like
those
old
chaps
on
terra
who
used
to
say
difficult
we
do
immediately
the
impossible
takes
a
little
longer
they
left
her
then
and
hurried
out
of
the
ship
even
though
they
felt
there
could
be
no
possible
danger
here
they
could
see
for
miles
in
every
direction
and
noticed
nothing
moving
they
were
wise
enough
from
experience
to
carry
their
rifles
slung
across
their
backs
and
wore
bandoliers
of
ammunition
in
addition
both
carried
tools
and
what
equipment
they
felt
might
be
needed
once
outside
they
ran
first
to
the
river
and
tested
the
water
it
was
fresh
and
clear
and
they
knew
this
would
be
a
good
source
of
water
for
their
proposed
city
until
men
might
pollute
it
with
their
garbage
and
wastes
got
your
pedometer
jak
asked
sure
right
here
in
my
coverall
pocket
why
i
suggest
this
would
be
a
good
place
for
the
center
of
the
north
side
yes
here
by
the
riverbank
would
i
go
east
and
you
go
west
a
half
mile
each
then
we
set
our
corner
stakes
then
we
both
walk
south
a
mile
and
set
those
and
have
the
four
corners
done
sometimes
owl
i
have
to
give
you
credit
for
having
brains
wish
i
could
say
the
same
about
you
jak
reached
out
and
gave
his
brother
a
friendly
shove
get
going
stupe
and
when
we
start
south
be
sure
you
keep
your
line
straight
look
who
yelping
mine
be
as
plumb
as
yours
probably
more
so
because
i
a
better
plumber
than
you
are
jon
started
his
pacing
while
jak
went
in
the
opposite
direction
after
a
pretended
at
jon
horrible
pun
when
they
returned
to
the
ship
as
the
sun
was
going
down
they
felt
they
had
made
a
good
beginning
but
as
they
went
into
the
control
room
to
talk
alone
away
from
their
mother
hearing
lest
they
worry
her
they
were
not
too
cheerful
you
know
anything
about
surveying
jak
slumped
into
a
seat
nope
not
a
sardine
worth
jon
paced
forth
and
back
in
the
little
room
that
what
has
me
worried
how
we
going
to
place
those
other
marking
stakes
in
exactly
the
right
spots
guess
we
have
to
measure
them
some
other
way
how
darned
if
i
know
you
the
mechanically
minded
one
i
thought
you
could
figure
it
out
jon
continued
his
pacing
his
young
forehead
creased
with
thought
finally
just
as
their
mother
called
them
to
dinner
he
looked
up
excitedly
hey
it
be
easy
after
all
how
jak
was
as
excited
as
his
brother
as
they
went
in
to
the
living
quarters
and
sat
down
at
the
table
a
light
plastic
line
that
wo
stretch
exactly
measured
and
fastened
to
two
metal
we
make
two
sets
and
i
get
it
one
the
length
of
the
blocks
the
other
the
width
of
the
streets
right
stick
a
pin
in
the
ground
measure
out
the
line
then
plant
one
of
our
regular
stakes
then
give
a
yank
pull
the
pin
out
and
haul
it
in
then
use
the
other
set
to
measure
the
street
yes
just
keep
going
hey
i
believe
with
that
system
we
could
each
work
alone
so
i
make
two
sets
jak
thought
all
this
over
swiftly
for
several
minutes
working
fork
and
knife
and
jaws
meanwhile
finally
between
mouthfuls
he
said
slowly
i
ca
see
a
flaw
in
it
as
long
as
we
mighty
careful
do
you
think
it
pass
inspection
if
we
take
our
time
and
make
sure
we
right
i
do
see
why
not
what
you
boys
talking
about
now
their
mother
set
a
refilled
dish
of
steaming
chlorella
stew
on
the
table
and
resumed
her
own
seat
they
explained
and
told
her
the
necessity
of
what
they
had
to
do
in
order
to
prove
up
their
father
claim
on
this
system
when
they
returned
to
terra
and
appeared
before
the
colonial
board
with
their
proofs
of
prime
discovery
the
worried
look
came
back
into
her
eyes
i
always
understood
that
surveying
was
a
mighty
exact
profession
do
you
really
think
you
can
measure
it
exactly
enough
to
take
the
place
of
a
regular
survey
i
think
we
can
make
it
close
enough
so
that
when
pop
wakes
up
and
shows
us
how
to
do
the
final
survey
with
the
instruments
we
can
save
a
lot
of
time
at
least
jon
assured
her
that
what
we
thinking
and
planning
about
now
you
see
mother
jak
broke
in
if
we
have
the
stakes
all
set
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
make
the
sights
on
each
one
after
father
teaches
us
how
to
use
the
transit
then
if
we
should
be
off
anywhere
we
can
fix
them
easily
yes
it
cut
down
the
time
a
lot
jon
went
on
and
now
we
so
near
done
i
want
to
get
everything
finished
so
we
can
go
back
to
terra
immejit
why
getting
homesick
his
mother
teased
not
so
much
that
but
we
want
to
get
our
claim
before
the
board
anything
can
happen
when
such
distances
and
time
are
concerned
and
we
just
do
want
anything
to
spoil
father
chances
of
having
this
valuable
claim
verified
i
see
she
smiled
now
in
relief
and
again
her
eyes
showed
the
pride
she
felt
in
her
two
manly
boys
who
were
daily
proving
themselves
more
than
equal
to
the
unusual
situations
in
which
they
found
themselves
your
father
woke
up
again
while
you
were
out
and
he
did
it
was
a
duet
of
happy
excitement
and
while
he
still
did
seem
to
realize
what
had
happened
he
acted
even
more
as
though
he
recognized
me
he
let
me
feed
him
some
broth
then
went
back
to
sleep
again
very
contentedly
golly
that
great
jon
reached
out
and
patted
her
hand
the
three
chatted
together
with
more
freedom
and
animation
than
they
had
known
since
the
terrible
accident
first
occurred
it
seemed
as
though
their
worst
troubles
were
over
for
tad
carver
was
so
reliable
so
confident
in
himself
so
even
beyond
their
natural
love
for
him
that
they
felt
everything
would
just
have
to
work
out
right
once
he
was
again
in
command
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
eating
the
boys
hurried
to
the
storeroom
and
found
some
metal
rods
cut
me
four
lengths
about
fifteen
inches
each
jon
ordered
as
he
went
to
the
workbench
he
cleared
a
space
then
began
getting
the
tools
he
wanted
and
hooking
up
the
induction
furnace
you
need
eight
for
two
full
sets
wo
you
i
got
to
thinking
we
better
make
only
one
set
for
now
if
it
works
out
all
ok
then
we
can
make
the
other
by
the
time
jak
had
the
pieces
cut
jon
was
ready
to
heat
one
end
of
each
in
the
furnace
then
bend
it
into
a
small
eye
the
other
end
he
sharpened
on
the
emery
wheel
now
measure
out
pieces
of
that
plastic
rope
he
ordered
pointing
to
a
reel
of
but
very
strong
line
figure
about
six
inches
extra
on
each
look
chum
you
tend
to
your
job
and
give
me
credit
for
brains
enough
to
know
that
much
jak
tone
was
almost
cross
for
sometimes
this
younger
brother
got
on
his
nerves
since
jon
did
occasionally
get
quite
bossy
but
the
elder
quickly
subdued
that
feeling
helped
by
the
surprised
and
somewhat
hurt
look
in
jon
eyes
he
knew
so
well
that
jon
was
merely
trying
as
he
himself
was
learning
to
do
to
see
that
neither
made
any
mistakes
in
this
important
work
they
were
attempting
to
do
in
their
father
absence
father
was
always
cautioning
them
to
take
pains
with
whatever
they
were
doing
and
they
usually
accepted
his
warning
and
advice
as
they
did
their
mother
without
any
more
grumbling
than
boys
ordinarily
make
about
such
fussing
but
now
each
of
them
and
both
of
them
together
had
to
be
and
did
try
to
be
extra
painstaking
in
all
the
things
their
father
would
have
cautioned
them
about
and
they
checked
and
rechecked
each
other
constantly
so
jak
said
nothing
more
and
quietly
helped
jon
complete
the
sets
after
all
he
admitted
honestly
there
were
undoubtedly
times
when
he
got
just
as
bossy
as
jon
did
soon
the
two
sets
of
pins
and
line
were
done
each
of
the
boys
measured
each
once
twice
to
make
doubly
sure
their
work
was
right
then
they
cut
up
and
sharpened
a
number
of
wooden
stakes
from
some
strips
they
found
in
the
storeroom
the
next
morning
they
started
out
early
each
carried
a
bundle
of
the
marking
stakes
and
jon
had
a
small
sledge
in
one
hand
in
addition
they
had
their
rifles
slung
across
their
backs
working
together
to
begin
with
jon
said
at
breakfast
we
can
start
the
eastward
leg
from
the
southwest
corner
and
run
it
a
ways
then
come
back
and
start
the
northward
one
from
this
same
corner
yes
if
we
get
that
first
corner
square
and
right
there
less
chance
of
the
other
three
being
wrong
they
more
or
less
check
themselves
they
soon
found
they
could
work
at
quite
a
swift
pace
and
at
lunch
time
jon
cried
at
this
rate
we
have
time
to
go
back
and
everything
and
still
get
done
within
our
two
weeks
yes
if
we
do
run
into
any
trouble
this
seems
to
be
working
out
fine
much
better
than
i
have
given
you
credit
for
being
able
to
figure
out
chubby
catfish
to
you
brother
jon
grinned
hey
that
reminds
me
i
want
to
see
if
that
river
got
any
fish
in
it
and
no
he
caught
himself
and
stopped
but
jak
knew
what
he
meant
their
mother
still
did
know
about
that
quicksand
jon
had
been
almost
trapped
in
and
they
did
want
her
to
learn
of
it
i
suppose
it
would
be
worth
knowing
jak
had
hastened
to
say
almost
as
if
interrupting
for
once
your
eternal
love
of
fishing
will
have
its
good
points
as
well
as
getting
us
fresh
food
what
about
the
ocean
i
try
that
too
if
i
have
time
wo
tell
us
too
much
about
the
deeper
sea
and
i
have
any
heavy
tackle
for
anything
very
big
if
we
happen
to
run
into
it
but
probably
close
to
shore
like
i
have
to
fish
we
would
catch
anything
my
lines
and
hooks
handle
if
can
handle
jak
said
with
a
grin
do
you
worry
about
me
jon
retorted
i
can
pull
in
anything
i
can
get
my
hook
on
except
a
sunken
ship
jak
jibed
and
jon
face
grew
red
that
incident
when
he
and
his
father
had
been
fishing
off
the
coast
of
southern
california
back
in
terra
pacific
ocean
was
still
a
tender
subject
with
him
he
had
had
to
cut
his
line
that
time
because
they
could
not
loosen
his
hooks
and
he
had
lost
a
favorite
spinner
and
leader
and
half
his
best
line
that
first
week
passed
uneventfully
the
boys
worked
hard
from
shortly
after
sunup
to
almost
sundown
so
hard
in
fact
that
their
mother
finally
protested
after
noticing
that
they
were
so
weary
that
they
slumped
in
their
chairs
at
the
table
and
could
hardly
eat
each
evening
when
they
returned
to
the
ship
now
you
boys
listen
to
your
mother
she
commanded
one
night
at
dinner
i
just
as
anxious
to
get
back
to
earth
as
you
are
but
there
no
sense
killing
yourselves
to
save
a
day
or
two
from
now
on
you
are
to
start
an
hour
later
and
quit
an
hour
earlier
jak
managed
a
weak
grin
guess
you
right
mother
but
we
are
coming
along
fine
sure
we
almost
completed
outlining
the
site
we
have
to
take
tomorrow
off
anyway
to
go
to
the
forest
out
there
and
cut
some
more
stakes
jon
added
it
make
a
nice
vacation
i
really
fed
up
with
so
much
sameness
of
hard
work
yes
it
been
a
steady
grind
no
fooling
but
we
wanted
to
get
it
done
as
quick
as
we
can
so
pop
can
check
it
for
their
father
had
been
waking
up
several
times
every
day
their
mother
reported
true
he
had
only
been
conscious
for
short
periods
and
was
still
too
weak
to
be
bothered
with
any
of
their
problems
but
she
told
the
boys
he
was
able
to
eat
something
each
time
he
awoke
and
his
mind
was
clear
again
she
was
preparing
easily
eaten
and
digested
foods
that
would
bring
back
his
strength
quickly
jak
asked
anxiously
whether
his
father
had
mentioned
how
the
leg
felt
and
mrs
carver
told
him
he
says
it
does
pain
any
although
sometimes
it
itches
beneath
the
cast
later
on
just
as
they
finished
eating
jak
suggested
take
your
tackle
along
tomorrow
chubby
and
we
chop
where
the
woods
meet
the
river
why
pal
you
a
good
kid
jon
made
a
fake
pass
at
his
brother
who
jumped
up
from
the
table
and
yanked
the
other
chair
backward
starting
a
small
scuffle
which
their
mother
wisely
did
not
try
to
stop
knowing
that
tired
as
they
were
it
would
last
only
a
few
seconds
and
would
be
good
for
them
when
the
boys
returned
from
their
expedition
the
next
night
with
arms
and
backs
loaded
with
bundles
of
stakes
and
jon
creel
with
two
she
met
them
anxiously
at
the
lockdoor
did
you
boys
hear
or
see
the
ship
that
passed
over
us
this
morning
ship
no
we
did
see
nor
hear
a
thing
sure
it
was
a
ship
no
i
did
see
it
either
i
thought
i
heard
one
and
ran
to
look
out
but
could
locate
anything
maybe
it
was
just
my
imagination
spaceship
or
airship
jon
asked
i
could
tell
you
that
either
except
that
if
i
did
really
hear
one
it
must
have
been
a
spaceship
to
disappear
so
quickly
unless
it
was
a
fast
jet
they
just
as
hard
to
spot
they
discussed
the
affair
for
some
time
but
could
come
to
no
conclusions
if
it
was
a
ship
why
had
it
stopped
or
signalled
and
if
it
was
one
what
had
she
heard
or
had
she
actually
heard
anything
two
evenings
later
the
two
boys
had
completed
outlining
their
city
site
and
were
just
climbing
into
the
when
they
heard
their
mother
voice
that
you
boys
come
in
here
hurry
at
the
urgency
in
her
voice
they
ran
quickly
and
found
her
sitting
at
the
side
of
their
father
bunk
as
they
got
closer
they
saw
his
head
turn
toward
them
and
recognition
in
the
eyes
hello
fellows
his
voice
was
weak
but
happy
father
oh
pop
you
awake
at
last
the
two
almost
fought
to
be
closest
to
him
but
their
mother
moved
a
little
and
both
sank
to
their
haunches
beside
the
bunk
each
with
one
of
their
father
somewhat
emaciated
hands
in
theirs
your
mother
tells
me
i
been
sick
quite
a
long
time
and
that
you
chaps
have
been
carrying
on
i
grateful
and
proud
you
should
see
the
way
mom
has
caught
on
to
doing
things
jon
said
quickly
she
does
almost
all
our
photographing
now
and
jon
has
developed
into
a
real
astrogator
jak
said
yes
pop
but
you
would
be
as
well
as
you
are
today
if
it
been
for
owl
knowing
how
to
set
your
leg
and
make
a
cast
for
it
and
giving
you
the
proper
medicines
and
intravenous
feedings
jon
turned
to
smile
at
his
brother
who
grew
red
in
the
face
and
tried
to
stop
the
compliments
but
the
younger
boy
rushed
on
he
really
a
whiz
as
a
doctor
knew
exactly
what
to
do
for
you
how
your
leg
feel
fine
thanks
to
you
jak
oh
it
was
so
much
and
i
did
i
had
to
study
a
lot
to
find
out
anyway
i
still
alive
and
that
shows
you
did
a
fine
job
mr
carver
lifted
a
weak
hand
to
caress
his
elder
son
face
then
he
turned
toward
jon
i
had
fine
reports
of
you
too
son
your
mother
says
yes
if
anyone
deserves
praise
around
here
it
jon
jak
broke
in
he
has
done
all
the
piloting
and
figuring
courses
and
he
even
invented
a
control
so
he
can
land
and
take
off
without
all
the
trouble
and
preciseness
needed
before
why
he
nix
owl
jon
was
the
one
to
be
embarrassed
now
that
can
wait
until
pop
stronger
the
main
thing
is
to
report
now
so
he
can
tell
us
what
to
do
next
where
are
we
and
what
has
been
done
so
far
mr
carver
asked
your
mother
has
or
would
tell
me
except
that
we
reached
the
new
system
and
are
landed
on
one
of
the
worlds
there
we
on
planet
two
and
we
laying
out
the
city
site
that
the
board
requires
this
sun
has
five
planets
and
two
and
three
are
perfectly
habitable
for
humans
but
no
natives
above
animal
level
jak
began
there
seven
moons
one
at
two
two
at
three
and
four
at
four
jon
took
up
the
tale
we
visited
all
the
planets
and
have
set
out
the
automatic
with
tapes
giving
you
the
credit
for
the
prime
discovery
they
named
the
sun
after
you
his
wife
leaned
forward
eyes
shining
with
pride
and
an
arm
across
the
shoulders
of
each
of
the
boys
they
named
the
planets
after
one
of
us
each
and
the
fifth
one
after
the
ship
and
we
given
names
to
the
moons
too
this
world
will
be
swell
for
people
who
like
it
warm
and
three
will
be
just
as
good
for
those
who
prefer
colder
weather
both
are
a
lot
like
terra
at
different
seasons
and
sections
and
both
are
rich
in
soil
water
forests
metals
and
and
we
discovered
a
cache
of
that
new
you
thought
you
saw
in
the
spectroscope
jon
broke
in
his
voice
bubbling
with
eagerness
right
here
on
two
not
a
mine
or
a
vein
understand
but
a
cache
in
a
metal
box
buried
in
the
sand
must
have
been
some
people
a
long
long
time
ago
because
from
the
sand
drifted
inside
the
box
it
apparently
had
been
touched
for
thousands
of
years
and
it
showed
up
on
five
but
it
guarded
by
some
sort
of
sentient
flames
jak
burst
in
his
father
face
lighted
up
have
you
tried
it
yet
he
asked
jon
no
the
boy
face
showed
disappointment
mom
would
let
me
take
any
chances
when
i
first
wanted
to
but
now
i
glad
it
very
highly
radioactive
still
in
spite
of
who
knows
how
many
deteriorations
it
might
blown
us
higher
than
up
maybe
though
when
you
get
better
we
can
study
if
we
have
got
a
small
lead
box
you
ought
to
be
able
to
make
one
his
father
broke
in
you
could
probably
handle
a
small
quantity
of
it
that
way
to
bring
it
in
so
we
can
study
it
maybe
though
as
an
afterthought
if
it
that
strong
you
better
wait
for
me
to
help
before
trying
any
of
it
in
the
generators
it
in
little
cubes
a
bit
smaller
than
our
copper
pellets
why
i
so
sure
it
a
fuel
and
that
it
was
put
here
by
some
sort
of
people
who
had
advanced
space
travel
a
long
long
time
ago
jon
was
still
excited
we
figure
all
we
have
to
do
is
finish
laying
out
the
town
here
and
then
we
can
start
back
for
terra
and
put
your
claim
before
the
colonial
board
jon
said
of
course
we
all
hoped
and
expected
you
be
well
enough
to
check
what
we
done
but
we
tried
to
follow
all
the
items
in
the
papers
the
board
gave
us
jak
added
seriously
and
now
you
well
we
can
make
sure
you
father
is
far
from
well
yet
their
mother
broke
in
her
voice
imperative
we
are
all
so
happy
he
awake
at
last
but
i
can
see
very
weak
and
that
all
this
excitement
has
been
almost
too
much
for
him
you
boys
say
night
to
him
now
and
then
run
off
and
eat
your
dinner
and
let
him
sleep
tomorrow
evening
you
can
finish
your
report
reluctantly
the
boys
obeyed
and
went
into
their
living
quarters
and
to
the
table
golly
i
should
think
pop
want
to
hear
all
about
it
now
jon
frowned
with
disappointment
he
does
do
you
worry
jak
tried
to
cheer
him
i
should
have
watched
him
more
closely
to
see
we
did
excite
or
overtire
him
but
i
was
just
as
happy
and
eager
as
you
were
he
be
stronger
after
another
good
long
sleep
but
we
got
to
be
careful
not
to
expect
too
much
of
him
for
some
time
yet
yes
i
know
you
right
then
jon
face
lighted
with
relief
but
it
sure
swell
to
have
him
awake
so
we
can
talk
to
him
and
he
can
take
charge
of
things
again
you
did
a
grand
job
owl
bringing
him
through
that
another
thing
you
big
bum
you
go
handing
out
praise
like
that
again
and
i
bust
you
one
oh
yeh
and
who
was
the
parrotfish
talking
up
so
big
the
few
little
things
i
did
jak
came
over
and
threw
his
arm
across
the
shoulders
of
his
taller
but
younger
brother
both
of
us
were
so
carried
away
by
our
enthusiasm
we
forgot
to
belittle
each
other
he
said
sagely
maybe
we
do
sort
of
like
each
other
after
all
jon
pushed
him
away
with
rough
tenderness
but
his
eyes
were
suspiciously
moist
his
words
though
were
an
attempted
snort
as
he
picked
up
his
knife
and
fork
what
do
you
want
the
next
waltz
when
the
boys
came
into
the
dinette
the
next
morning
their
mother
was
humming
happily
as
she
prepared
breakfast
and
greeted
them
with
a
cheery
smile
pop
awake
yet
jon
asked
as
he
saw
her
mood
no
but
he
sleeping
so
sweetly
i
know
he
all
right
she
answered
they
sat
down
and
began
eating
after
finishing
jak
said
well
we
might
as
well
go
out
and
work
some
more
on
our
townsite
call
us
when
pop
wakes
up
will
you
please
jon
took
a
last
sip
of
his
that
be
silly
jak
frowned
we
know
he
ca
come
and
help
us
so
why
should
we
run
several
miles
back
here
when
we
can
see
him
when
we
get
back
jon
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
his
eyes
flashing
almost
angrily
but
their
mother
interrupted
quickly
with
a
question
boys
just
why
do
you
have
to
lay
out
such
a
site
the
board
requires
it
jon
answered
shortly
in
the
early
days
of
exploration
jak
explained
more
patiently
some
of
the
space
crews
used
to
make
their
reports
after
merely
flying
above
the
surface
of
the
planets
of
a
new
system
in
fact
some
of
them
did
even
go
that
close
and
merely
made
up
sketchy
reports
then
when
colonists
got
there
jon
who
had
simmered
down
by
now
took
up
the
explanation
they
often
found
conditions
very
different
and
many
times
quite
dangerous
to
them
yes
sometimes
there
were
even
intelligent
inhabitants
who
had
been
reported
so
their
planets
could
be
used
for
colonization
so
the
board
made
this
new
ruling
jak
continued
now
we
have
to
have
so
many
photos
taken
from
various
heights
and
at
different
places
all
over
the
surface
of
each
planet
and
each
moon
more
than
one
hundred
miles
in
diameter
and
we
have
to
lay
out
a
townsite
on
the
most
earthlike
planet
mostly
to
show
we
actually
have
been
there
and
spent
some
time
there
and
it
really
does
make
any
difference
whether
the
people
come
here
to
live
use
it
or
not
but
we
think
they
will
use
ours
because
we
selected
a
place
close
to
a
river
and
the
ocean
close
to
forests
and
fairly
near
minerals
yes
you
have
done
a
wonderful
job
i
know
that
much
about
it
well
we
go
out
and
our
lines
jon
said
i
been
studying
and
experimenting
with
the
theodolite
and
i
can
what
is
that
she
asked
what
what
oh
the
that
the
surveyor
telescope
i
learned
enough
about
it
so
i
can
tell
if
our
lines
have
been
run
straight
and
as
we
were
so
careful
in
measuring
the
distances
quite
sure
they
fairly
accurate
yes
jak
chimed
in
i
bet
none
of
them
are
more
than
an
inch
off
if
that
optimist
jon
scoffed
i
take
that
bet
away
from
you
only
it
be
cheating
an
infant
jak
started
a
retort
then
thought
better
of
it
and
shut
up
they
left
the
ship
soon
jon
carrying
the
surveying
instrument
over
his
shoulder
and
jak
the
arrived
at
the
nearest
corner
of
their
townsite
jon
set
the
instrument
down
while
jak
went
on
to
the
next
stake
by
means
of
the
graduated
circle
attached
just
below
the
telescope
and
the
plumb
line
suspended
from
it
jon
adjusted
the
collapsible
legs
until
he
felt
sure
it
was
correctly
focussed
then
as
jak
went
ahead
from
stake
to
stake
jon
took
sights
to
make
sure
each
marker
was
centered
on
his
cross
hairs
the
ones
that
were
not
he
indicated
by
hand
signals
and
jak
reset
them
to
left
or
right
until
jon
was
satisfied
they
completed
all
of
one
side
before
lunch
then
returned
to
the
ship
they
found
their
mother
had
opened
both
lockdoors
while
they
were
gone
and
fresh
crisp
though
warm
air
was
circulating
through
the
ship
blowing
out
the
old
chemically
pure
yet
air
their
purifiers
had
been
for
so
long
their
father
was
awake
but
still
so
weak
he
was
making
no
attempt
to
sit
fully
up
in
bed
although
his
wife
had
slipped
an
extra
pillow
beneath
his
head
ho
fellows
he
greeted
the
boys
as
they
came
into
the
bunkroom
how
the
job
coming
just
fine
pop
we
have
the
townsite
all
laid
out
and
now
we
checking
to
make
sure
the
lines
are
straight
jak
told
him
he
frowned
a
bit
how
did
you
manage
it
neither
of
you
is
a
surveyor
or
have
you
learned
how
to
do
that
too
i
think
i
figured
out
the
theodolite
well
enough
to
tell
if
our
lines
are
straight
and
that
what
we
using
now
jon
continued
i
ca
measure
distances
with
it
though
jak
explained
more
in
detail
how
they
had
measured
the
blocks
and
street
widths
and
rechecked
them
all
i
ca
see
why
it
wo
pass
their
father
said
when
they
finished
probably
no
one
will
ever
check
it
unless
they
actually
use
the
site
when
the
colonists
come
it
shows
we
were
landed
here
long
enough
to
do
the
work
and
that
the
important
thing
what
about
the
rest
of
the
mapping
i
go
get
the
papers
jon
ran
out
to
return
in
a
few
minutes
with
the
book
of
reports
and
the
rolls
of
film
and
prints
they
had
made
on
all
the
planets
and
satellites
you
can
check
these
as
you
feel
up
to
it
pop
and
anything
that
looks
wrong
we
can
go
back
and
or
do
over
mr
carver
riffled
quickly
through
the
pages
and
saw
that
each
question
had
been
answered
each
measurement
given
an
answer
though
whether
correct
or
not
of
course
he
could
not
know
all
the
information
required
had
been
supplied
at
least
he
gave
the
boys
his
grin
even
as
he
was
shaking
his
head
in
wonder
you
chaps
certainly
have
done
a
job
looks
like
i
have
to
take
the
backseat
from
now
the
two
boys
were
shocked
by
that
not
on
your
life
pop
we
maybe
did
fairly
well
but
we
need
you
just
the
same
i
say
we
do
jak
chimed
in
there
so
much
yet
you
can
teach
us
why
we
only
begun
learning
most
of
the
things
we
want
to
know
mr
carver
smiled
up
at
his
sons
i
always
glad
to
tell
you
anything
i
can
fellows
it
good
to
see
you
growing
up
though
he
turned
his
head
to
face
jon
more
directly
what
that
about
a
new
system
you
rigged
up
so
you
can
land
and
take
off
with
only
one
switch
jon
explained
and
the
two
were
soon
deep
in
technical
talk
of
electronic
relays
and
cells
and
automatic
finally
mrs
carver
came
in
with
a
tray
of
lunch
for
her
husband
and
told
the
boys
their
food
was
on
the
table
all
right
you
chaps
go
and
eat
mr
carver
said
i
take
another
nap
while
you
out
this
afternoon
then
maybe
i
feel
up
to
talking
some
more
this
evening
and
going
over
these
reports
with
you
the
second
day
later
the
boys
finished
their
and
came
back
to
the
ship
in
midafternoon
their
father
was
again
awake
and
they
went
in
to
see
him
we
all
done
here
pop
so
what
say
we
go
back
to
that
cache
and
see
about
getting
the
stuff
aboard
jon
asked
i
guess
from
all
you
said
that
the
most
important
thing
now
he
agreed
after
a
moment
consideration
only
thing
is
i
been
wondering
if
you
could
move
me
into
the
control
room
and
fix
a
couch
for
me
there
sure
that
easy
jak
told
him
but
jon
frowned
in
thought
yes
we
can
do
it
but
we
have
to
figure
out
first
how
to
fasten
the
cot
down
and
then
make
some
arrangement
so
you
can
stand
any
acceleration
we
may
have
to
use
how
about
fixing
the
seat
into
a
bunk
hey
that
the
ticket
jon
brightened
he
ran
out
and
soon
was
helping
his
mother
gather
blankets
sheets
and
pillows
and
going
with
jak
to
bring
an
extra
mattress
from
the
storeroom
they
set
the
seat
to
recline
and
then
while
mrs
carver
was
making
up
the
bed
the
boys
carried
their
father
a
much
lighter
load
now
than
when
he
had
first
been
hurt
and
put
him
in
his
new
bed
say
this
is
all
right
mr
carver
exclaimed
after
jon
had
lowered
the
visiplate
so
his
father
could
look
into
it
without
distortion
or
all
the
comforts
of
home
he
grinned
at
his
wife
she
stooped
and
kissed
him
be
sure
and
let
us
know
any
time
you
get
too
tired
though
i
will
honey
he
assured
her
but
actually
i
so
comfortable
i
do
see
why
i
ca
stay
here
as
well
as
in
bed
until
the
strong
enough
to
start
getting
up
everything
else
ready
he
watched
anxiously
then
admiringly
as
jon
started
the
tubes
firing
balanced
them
and
took
them
off
with
the
throwing
of
his
one
switch
in
his
visiplate
the
elder
man
watched
with
intense
interest
the
scenery
over
which
they
were
passing
jon
had
set
course
so
they
would
go
completely
around
this
world
of
two
until
they
came
to
that
desert
mr
carver
made
many
enthusiastic
comments
about
this
splendid
planet
that
now
bore
his
wife
name
yes
and
three
just
as
nice
only
colder
jon
reported
eagerly
folks
who
like
cold
weather
can
live
there
without
too
much
trouble
at
all
it
funny
though
jak
declared
with
a
frown
that
there
no
protoplasmic
life
there
at
all
that
we
could
find
he
hastened
to
add
lots
of
vegetation
though
jon
added
that
means
the
soil
will
be
good
for
growing
things
does
it
it
certainly
sounds
like
it
his
father
smiled
the
colonists
may
have
to
adapt
their
to
fit
and
probably
bring
their
own
worms
and
bees
and
so
on
but
they
should
be
able
to
farm
there
from
your
surveys
it
appears
there
are
plenty
of
minerals
so
they
can
start
mines
and
factories
of
all
kinds
right
away
yes
this
looks
like
a
pretty
good
solar
system
you
bet
pop
you
sure
picked
a
winner
in
this
one
jon
eyes
gleamed
with
satisfaction
i
had
an
idea
from
the
spectroscopic
examinations
we
made
back
there
near
sirius
that
we
find
it
fairly
good
here
but
to
be
honest
i
did
dare
hope
it
would
be
this
good
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
really
more
interested
in
that
line
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
than
i
was
in
new
planets
for
colonization
although
we
needed
those
too
to
make
the
trip
pay
off
before
long
they
came
above
the
beginning
of
that
desert
and
jon
slowed
and
circled
preparatory
to
landing
jon
kept
his
eyes
upon
his
instruments
and
when
he
saw
they
were
close
to
the
actual
latitude
and
longitude
he
killed
the
speed
to
their
slowest
cruising
range
and
their
height
to
a
few
hundred
yards
when
he
knew
he
was
almost
at
the
exact
spot
he
stared
intently
into
his
pilot
magnifying
visiplate
at
the
same
time
keeping
his
fingers
tautly
on
the
landing
switch
soon
in
his
plate
he
saw
the
top
of
that
cache
cover
in
the
nearing
distance
he
circled
until
he
judged
he
could
land
close
to
it
then
closed
the
switch
softly
easily
the
came
in
to
a
landing
on
the
hard
packed
sand
and
jon
shut
off
the
power
and
put
everything
in
neutral
his
father
had
wisely
kept
silent
during
this
maneuvering
but
now
he
let
out
his
breath
in
a
that
the
neatest
landing
i
ever
saw
he
told
jon
admiringly
that
gadget
of
yours
will
make
you
a
young
fortune
when
we
get
it
back
to
terra
jon
actually
blushed
with
pleased
embarrassment
aw
it
but
jak
interrupted
him
almost
fiercely
do
go
playing
coy
chubby
you
know
darned
well
it
wonderful
sure
i
do
jon
laughed
then
and
the
rest
joined
in
but
you
have
tromped
on
me
if
i
been
the
one
to
say
so
he
turned
quickly
to
face
his
father
what
do
we
do
about
this
my
suggestion
would
be
for
you
to
put
on
your
suit
and
go
out
and
open
those
covers
you
told
me
about
give
me
the
analyzer
first
and
i
study
the
stuff
emanations
when
you
get
it
uncovered
i
go
out
jak
offered
quickly
you
and
jon
had
better
study
it
together
i
do
know
anything
about
it
but
the
kid
does
and
be
the
one
to
handle
it
until
you
well
better
take
the
jack
that
cover
heavy
remember
jon
said
and
jak
ran
out
i
never
have
been
able
to
do
anything
if
it
had
been
for
wiser
advice
jon
said
honestly
as
he
brought
the
analyzer
to
his
father
from
the
instrument
rack
i
apt
to
go
off
you
know
mr
carver
looked
fondly
up
at
his
wife
who
moved
quickly
to
his
side
and
put
her
hand
against
his
cheek
a
couple
of
grand
fellows
you
raised
darling
he
said
softly
raised
you
mean
she
smiled
down
at
him
they
fight
all
the
time
but
when
it
comes
to
the
pinch
they
work
together
and
i
know
they
really
love
and
admire
each
other
very
much
jon
chuckled
and
spoke
into
the
mike
the
folks
are
taking
our
good
names
in
vain
owl
yes
i
heard
them
came
back
the
elder
boy
voice
from
the
speaker
if
they
only
knew
what
we
really
think
of
each
other
and
then
followed
his
attempt
at
a
sneering
laugh
in
their
visiplates
those
inside
the
ship
could
see
jak
in
his
spacesuit
trotting
awkwardly
across
the
sand
toward
the
cache
he
carried
the
jack
and
when
he
got
there
used
it
to
raise
the
heavy
cover
and
throw
it
back
he
jumped
into
the
hole
and
took
the
cover
off
the
smaller
box
then
scrambled
quickly
out
and
ran
some
distance
away
shall
i
come
back
now
or
wait
here
to
cover
it
again
he
asked
over
his
maybe
you
better
wait
out
there
a
few
minutes
his
father
replied
into
the
mike
attached
to
his
seat
if
we
ca
figure
out
something
in
a
fairly
short
time
i
tell
you
and
you
can
recap
the
boxes
and
come
back
he
busied
himself
adjusting
the
analyzer
and
he
and
young
jon
studied
the
lines
carefully
for
quite
a
time
finally
the
father
roused
this
is
going
to
take
a
lot
of
study
and
work
he
told
his
younger
son
then
he
spoke
into
the
mike
better
come
back
in
jak
he
turned
his
head
again
to
face
the
boy
with
him
did
you
find
a
lead
box
jon
no
sir
we
have
anything
like
that
in
our
stores
jon
answered
but
there
is
quite
a
roll
of
lead
foil
can
we
do
anything
with
that
how
much
is
there
and
how
thick
is
it
the
foil
twenty
inches
wide
and
about
twelve
feet
long
jon
reported
as
he
came
back
after
a
quick
run
to
the
storeroom
to
measure
the
foil
he
had
delayed
a
moment
or
two
at
the
lock
to
help
jak
out
of
his
suit
it
a
thick
that
not
so
good
let
see
if
we
quadrupled
it
that
would
give
us
an
eighth
no
that
not
enough
better
take
a
piece
and
fold
it
to
at
least
eight
thicknesses
then
go
wrap
it
around
a
piece
of
that
metal
and
bring
it
into
the
lock
that
not
too
much
protection
if
the
stuff
so
strong
is
it
pop
well
double
that
then
but
i
think
it
keep
the
rays
off
you
long
enough
to
bring
it
in
especially
since
you
be
in
your
suit
and
if
you
put
on
gloves
all
right
jon
started
out
then
turned
back
what
about
the
rest
of
it
when
we
leave
do
we
take
it
all
with
us
no
slowly
i
doubt
if
anyone
else
would
find
it
and
steal
it
before
we
get
back
on
the
other
hand
the
more
we
can
take
back
with
us
supposing
we
learn
how
to
use
it
and
it
as
good
as
we
think
the
more
we
could
get
for
it
on
terra
to
give
another
immediate
stake
to
come
back
i
have
a
thought
pop
why
not
just
the
whole
big
box
now
in
to
the
outside
of
the
ship
and
make
a
small
box
that
hold
some
to
bring
into
the
ship
to
experiment
with
jon
eyes
blazed
eagerly
that
a
thought
jak
exclaimed
while
their
father
answered
more
slowly
yes
i
believe
that
could
be
done
safely
especially
if
we
put
it
back
near
the
stern
is
the
ship
close
enough
so
the
lock
can
bring
in
the
big
box
i
do
think
so
jon
answered
after
a
searching
look
out
of
the
but
with
our
suits
on
jak
and
i
could
carry
it
we
we
been
close
to
the
stuff
several
times
for
about
as
long
as
take
jak
added
and
it
does
seem
to
have
hurt
us
any
kind
of
a
large
box
is
it
mr
carver
asked
quizzically
might
be
sort
of
heavy
the
boys
flushed
and
jon
picked
up
his
slide
rule
and
did
some
quick
figuring
then
he
announced
crestfallen
great
mackerel
i
sure
went
off
that
time
ok
i
take
the
ship
up
and
bring
it
down
closer
that
mighty
delicate
maneuvering
his
mother
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
sure
you
can
do
it
jon
shrugged
if
i
ca
the
first
time
i
try
again
his
father
had
to
smile
at
the
boy
confidence
in
himself
but
he
merely
said
this
i
got
to
watch
assured
everyone
was
safely
strapped
in
jon
started
the
tubes
firing
raised
the
ship
into
the
air
watching
his
plate
closely
as
he
circled
about
then
came
down
again
right
beside
and
not
over
five
feet
from
to
box
that
perfect
his
father
cried
delightedly
watching
in
his
plate
you
sure
getting
to
be
an
expert
pilot
son
and
you
getting
too
excited
and
too
tired
from
all
this
tad
mrs
carver
said
determinedly
we
have
no
more
of
it
today
you
boys
go
into
the
living
room
and
you
relax
and
take
a
nap
we
have
you
getting
sick
again
the
boys
started
to
protest
but
their
father
grinned
our
voice
boys
and
she
right
i
was
trying
too
much
we
not
in
that
big
a
hurry
jon
you
and
jak
go
make
a
box
to
hold
our
specimen
they
left
him
and
in
moments
he
was
asleep
from
exhaustion
in
the
storeroom
jon
found
some
pieces
of
oak
and
jak
and
he
made
up
their
box
finishing
just
as
their
mother
called
them
to
dinner
it
was
a
cube
sturdily
fastened
with
plenty
of
screws
strong
enough
to
hold
solid
osmium
the
lead
foil
was
carefully
fitted
into
the
interior
and
was
now
twelve
layers
thick
of
an
inch
that
ought
to
do
it
jak
said
and
jon
agreed
let
go
out
and
fill
it
after
we
eat
jak
was
all
eagerness
jon
shook
his
head
not
unless
pop
says
to
now
that
he
awake
i
just
do
like
to
make
decisions
jak
grinned
you
right
of
course
guess
we
got
too
having
to
do
things
ourselves
while
he
was
unconscious
yes
we
still
pretty
inexperienced
and
i
glad
we
do
have
to
figure
things
out
now
still
we
ca
go
back
to
depending
too
much
on
him
jak
said
thoughtfully
that
way
we
never
get
the
habit
of
thinking
for
ourselves
and
deciding
and
that
would
be
bad
but
about
this
i
agree
fully
he
added
quickly
as
he
saw
his
brother
about
to
protest
even
if
i
do
know
much
about
it
i
can
see
that
this
dangerous
to
monkey
with
their
father
awakened
later
much
refreshed
by
his
nap
after
the
boys
had
explained
and
exhibited
their
new
box
he
agreed
it
would
be
all
right
for
them
to
go
out
and
get
a
single
piece
of
the
metal
leave
it
in
the
lock
though
he
added
then
in
the
morning
maybe
i
feel
like
helping
jon
study
and
experiment
with
it
the
two
boys
ran
to
get
into
their
suits
and
soon
were
outside
carrying
their
box
they
jumped
into
the
large
cache
box
after
lifting
off
the
lid
and
took
the
top
from
the
inner
one
they
set
the
carrier
beside
it
then
ran
back
to
the
ship
with
the
distant
hands
jon
flipped
a
nugget
into
the
small
box
and
set
it
aside
on
the
sand
using
the
same
he
closed
both
covers
then
he
brought
the
little
box
back
and
deposited
it
on
the
floor
of
the
lock
the
two
boys
took
off
their
suits
and
hung
them
in
the
wall
closet
then
went
into
the
control
room
you
were
right
pop
we
sure
could
have
handled
the
big
box
at
all
jon
grinned
still
panting
even
the
little
one
is
really
heavy
with
just
one
nugget
in
it
his
father
grinned
back
i
had
an
idea
but
thought
i
let
you
learn
the
hard
way
now
maybe
you
remember
it
longer
anyway
we
got
it
in
the
lock
and
tomorrow
if
you
feel
up
to
it
we
can
start
experimenting
just
how
big
are
the
pellets
a
little
over
half
the
size
of
our
ones
jon
told
him
we
have
to
cut
it
before
we
try
working
with
it
jak
having
disposed
of
the
used
plastic
from
their
suits
had
come
into
the
control
room
and
was
listening
interestedly
as
was
their
mother
who
was
hovering
near
not
quite
sure
she
liked
the
idea
of
her
menfolks
fussing
with
this
unknown
but
admittedly
dangerous
metal
that
means
we
have
to
make
and
install
a
smaller
injector
too
does
it
jon
asked
and
when
his
father
nodded
he
added
i
see
about
making
it
later
when
we
found
out
whether
we
can
use
the
stuff
right
now
we
all
better
get
some
sleep
i
bushed
and
i
imagine
you
chaps
are
too
how
about
you
marci
mr
carver
turned
to
his
wife
well
i
could
use
some
sleep
she
admitted
right
pop
good
night
mom
early
the
next
morning
the
boys
were
clamoring
to
get
started
but
their
mother
would
not
let
them
go
into
the
control
room
now
you
listen
to
mother
she
protested
using
a
favorite
phrase
of
hers
your
father
has
made
any
sign
yet
you
wait
until
he
awake
and
has
had
something
to
eat
i
know
how
anxious
you
are
to
do
all
these
things
but
you
must
remember
he
is
strong
yet
and
we
must
not
let
him
overdo
he
is
as
much
a
child
about
such
things
as
you
two
are
but
someone
has
to
watch
him
the
boys
laughed
rather
shamefacedly
it
just
we
get
so
interested
in
things
mom
jon
apologized
yes
i
know
but
if
you
will
look
in
your
dictionary
you
will
find
a
word
called
she
smiled
never
heard
of
it
jon
grinned
as
he
went
to
get
a
reelbook
on
radioactives
and
began
studying
jak
too
went
back
to
studying
and
trying
to
classify
the
various
specimens
he
had
obtained
from
the
two
worlds
however
they
soon
remembered
their
usual
duties
and
whisked
through
their
various
chores
about
the
ship
then
went
back
to
their
absorbing
occupations
they
had
been
at
these
nearly
an
hour
when
they
heard
their
voice
dropping
everything
they
sprang
toward
the
control
room
and
found
him
and
looking
much
better
mrs
carver
came
running
in
and
they
were
told
feel
fine
this
is
a
wonderful
bed
seem
to
be
much
stronger
today
too
that
wonderful
i
go
get
you
some
breakfast
jon
ran
for
a
basin
of
water
and
towels
and
he
and
jak
helped
their
father
with
his
toilet
while
you
eating
pop
how
about
me
cutting
off
that
piece
of
the
new
metal
so
we
can
start
studying
it
how
big
a
piece
were
you
figuring
on
mr
carver
asked
with
that
quizzical
look
jon
flushed
and
mentally
changed
the
size
he
had
planned
to
get
about
a
gram
he
asked
i
say
more
like
a
few
milligrams
his
father
grinned
plenty
for
our
initial
studies
and
analyses
and
should
hurt
us
any
if
we
careful
and
wear
insulation
but
that
only
a
size
well
again
quizzically
jon
flushed
once
more
yes
that
big
enough
to
test
i
realize
now
it
a
good
thing
i
waited
for
you
to
help
me
i
probably
have
burned
myself
but
bad
actually
he
smiled
now
i
was
figuring
on
about
a
quarter
of
a
pellet
his
father
frowned
you
should
have
known
better
than
that
jon
i
thought
i
taught
you
something
about
being
careful
and
the
dangers
of
rashness
or
impulsiveness
especially
around
anything
as
dangerous
as
this
stuff
undoubtedly
is
you
did
sir
and
i
sorry
but
i
forget
sometimes
when
i
get
too
enthusiastic
well
philosophically
you
probably
learn
as
you
grow
older
if
you
live
that
long
but
again
there
was
that
disarming
grin
which
jon
repaid
in
kind
before
leaving
to
get
his
tools
and
go
after
the
mite
of
new
metal
this
time
he
did
not
neglect
his
precautions
he
wore
his
suit
and
put
on
a
pair
of
gloves
carefully
he
lifted
a
pellet
from
the
box
wrapped
it
in
several
layers
of
lead
foil
left
after
making
the
box
he
carried
it
so
into
the
storeroom
locked
it
in
a
vice
and
with
a
fine
hacksaw
cut
off
a
tiny
bit
still
wrapped
carefully
in
the
lead
foil
he
carried
the
remainder
of
the
pellet
back
to
the
box
in
the
lock
closed
the
lid
and
then
took
the
sample
inside
he
took
off
his
suit
and
donned
a
hooded
gown
and
the
leaded
gloves
good
his
father
said
when
jon
told
what
he
had
done
i
think
i
feel
well
enough
to
sit
up
a
bit
suppose
you
crank
this
seat
halfway
up
then
i
can
watch
better
while
you
make
the
tests
just
be
sure
you
do
get
too
tired
jon
said
solicitously
as
he
raised
the
seat
and
locked
it
at
he
had
brought
in
another
of
the
and
he
slipped
this
over
his
head
arms
and
upper
torso
arranging
the
balance
of
it
down
over
his
legs
then
acting
on
his
father
various
instructions
he
took
the
particle
from
its
wrappings
and
began
his
tests
he
measured
the
amount
of
radioactivity
and
together
they
computed
its
wow
that
sure
is
stuff
jon
exclaimed
when
they
had
completed
the
various
tests
which
they
had
the
equipment
to
make
his
father
silently
motioned
him
to
set
the
seat
back
to
full
recline
and
lay
there
concentrating
for
some
time
before
he
spoke
yes
he
said
at
last
it
even
higher
in
the
scale
than
i
thought
lots
higher
than
curium
even
now
and
no
telling
by
any
tests
we
can
make
what
it
was
originally
before
its
many
reductions
that
must
have
taken
place
over
the
long
time
it
has
undoubtedly
been
lying
out
there
probably
way
above
anything
known
even
theoretically
to
terran
scientists
can
we
use
it
jon
was
quivering
with
excitement
if
we
can
figure
out
a
way
to
do
so
safely
so
it
does
want
to
disintegrate
all
at
once
i
think
we
really
got
a
fuel
a
super
fuel
but
we
have
to
go
at
it
mighty
slow
and
easy
that
stuff
could
blow
us
higher
than
up
if
used
wrongly
yes
i
know
but
after
our
scientists
first
liberated
atomic
energy
for
their
bombs
many
people
said
they
could
control
a
hydrogen
bomb
but
they
did
and
later
the
thorium
bomb
and
then
they
got
our
activated
copper
so
i
betting
they
can
figure
this
out
both
fell
silent
although
there
were
a
dozen
eager
questions
the
boy
wanted
so
much
to
ask
but
he
did
not
interrupt
his
father
line
of
thought
even
though
long
long
minutes
dragged
away
while
the
elder
still
pondered
the
problem
at
last
after
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
tad
carver
stirred
and
looked
up
this
is
going
to
take
a
long
time
to
figure
out
he
said
slowly
i
not
too
much
on
atomics
myself
and
neither
are
you
now
you
run
along
and
do
whatever
else
you
have
to
do
it
a
cinch
we
wo
be
able
to
try
this
stuff
right
away
if
we
try
it
at
all
the
disappointment
on
jon
face
was
plain
but
he
restrained
any
protests
knowing
his
father
was
right
and
not
wishing
to
call
down
on
himself
another
verbal
chastisement
like
that
recent
one
what
about
the
rest
of
the
stuff
he
asked
instead
shall
i
get
the
box
out
of
the
cache
and
weld
it
onto
the
hull
as
we
thought
we
might
do
i
do
see
why
not
we
want
to
take
it
back
to
terra
with
us
whether
we
figure
out
how
to
use
it
or
decide
the
job
too
big
for
us
and
turn
it
over
to
the
scientists
there
to
handle
right
jon
went
over
to
the
controls
of
the
handling
arms
in
the
lock
watching
in
the
special
visiplate
he
opened
the
outer
lockdoor
extended
the
hands
and
guided
them
down
into
the
cache
after
using
them
to
lift
the
lid
off
the
larger
carefully
he
manipulated
them
to
grasp
the
inner
box
by
its
lower
and
experimentally
lift
it
an
inch
or
so
finding
that
it
balanced
he
slowly
made
the
lift
the
heavy
container
from
its
ages
old
resting
place
and
up
onto
the
top
surface
of
the
ship
near
the
stern
making
sure
it
was
securely
held
there
he
put
on
his
suit
gathered
up
his
welding
outfit
and
went
outside
and
climbed
onto
the
hull
going
to
where
the
box
rested
he
began
the
task
of
welding
its
bottom
onto
the
metal
hull
then
he
released
the
grip
of
the
handlers
and
leaving
them
dangling
in
the
air
welded
the
other
three
bottom
edges
finished
he
turned
off
his
torch
rose
to
his
feet
and
started
back
but
after
a
step
or
two
he
stopped
and
thought
pop
he
said
into
his
do
you
hear
me
yes
jon
the
answer
came
back
at
once
into
his
earphones
what
is
it
i
was
just
wondering
if
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
a
few
places
along
the
edges
of
the
cover
too
so
there
be
less
chances
of
its
coming
open
it
be
easy
to
open
it
later
how
it
fastened
now
just
a
simple
hasp
better
touch
it
in
a
few
places
then
to
make
sure
right
when
this
was
done
jon
returned
inside
the
ship
and
saw
to
it
that
all
the
equipment
was
put
back
in
place
and
carefully
locked
only
then
did
he
doff
his
suit
and
return
to
the
control
room
well
that
done
what
now
anything
else
you
need
to
do
here
on
this
planet
not
that
i
know
of
why
i
was
thinking
that
if
everything
has
been
taken
care
of
we
might
as
well
start
back
to
terra
no
use
staying
any
longer
than
is
necessary
i
i
think
we
done
everything
have
you
checked
the
record
book
and
the
pictures
no
not
fully
and
i
probably
should
before
we
take
off
at
that
but
i
think
i
better
have
another
nap
or
rest
now
so
i
go
over
them
after
a
while
put
them
on
the
table
here
so
i
can
reach
them
right
sir
you
take
plenty
of
time
to
rest
if
jak
not
too
busy
to
go
with
me
i
think
i
go
fishing
in
the
river
out
there
by
the
edge
of
the
desert
maybe
we
can
get
quite
a
haul
to
take
with
us
for
fresh
food
on
the
trip
good
idea
your
mother
said
they
were
delicious
when
the
two
boys
returned
with
full
creels
late
that
afternoon
they
went
at
once
to
see
how
their
father
was
getting
along
he
was
awake
and
studying
the
records
they
had
made
hi
fellows
everything
seems
to
be
in
fine
shape
you
chaps
certainly
did
a
job
while
i
was
get
any
fish
lots
of
them
they
sure
bite
swell
here
maybe
because
no
one
has
ever
fished
them
before
and
they
have
no
idea
of
lures
and
hooks
then
let
just
rest
and
eat
and
sleep
and
plan
to
take
off
in
the
morning
eh
you
bet
i
sure
be
glad
to
get
back
home
again
jak
declared
this
chasing
around
is
fun
but
i
homesick
for
terra
i
guess
me
too
kind
of
besides
i
want
to
get
some
more
schooling
at
one
of
our
atomic
institutes
jon
added
more
slowly
going
to
give
up
exploration
son
his
father
asked
drily
no
sir
but
i
figured
we
have
to
stay
on
terra
for
a
year
or
so
while
you
get
everything
straightened
out
about
this
discovery
and
get
the
ship
ready
for
the
next
trip
so
while
you
doing
that
i
might
as
well
be
trying
to
learn
something
more
we
will
and
you
should
and
i
presume
he
turned
to
face
jak
you
want
to
study
medicine
that
and
other
things
the
elder
boy
responded
soberly
if
we
can
afford
it
sir
i
like
to
get
several
top
men
in
various
branches
to
give
me
some
special
coaching
instead
of
going
to
a
school
that
would
get
me
started
straight
and
they
could
recommend
good
books
for
me
to
be
studying
while
we
on
our
future
trips
their
father
looked
up
at
his
wife
with
a
smile
what
happened
to
our
babies
marci
they
just
grown
up
but
we
have
some
pretty
wonderful
men
in
their
place
her
eyes
shone
it
was
pretty
hard
at
first
after
you
got
hurt
and
they
had
to
take
charge
of
everything
to
realize
that
they
had
grown
away
from
us
but
i
soon
found
that
they
had
really
she
continued
hastily
as
the
boys
gave
cries
of
dismay
they
have
matured
wonderfully
but
we
have
not
lost
our
boys
at
all
well
i
should
say
not
jak
cried
hotly
we
still
kids
not
men
jon
declared
why
there
still
so
much
to
learn
and
experience
to
gain
we
barely
started
growing
up
you
can
keep
learning
back
on
terra
their
mother
said
as
for
me
i
glad
we
going
to
be
there
a
year
or
more
i
want
to
live
in
a
house
again
on
land
i
know
then
we
all
better
get
to
bed
their
father
said
with
his
roguish
smile
otherwise
we
all
be
too
fagged
out
to
take
off
for
home
tomorrow
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
finished
the
next
morning
the
carvers
all
assembled
in
the
control
room
for
the
start
back
to
terra
jon
had
already
made
the
astrogational
calculations
for
their
trip
having
worked
on
them
off
and
on
during
many
evenings
of
the
past
several
weeks
but
just
as
they
were
all
strapping
down
his
father
stopped
jon
with
a
sudden
exclamation
wait
son
i
think
we
better
go
back
close
enough
to
all
the
planets
and
the
sun
to
make
sure
all
the
signals
are
working
right
that
one
of
the
most
important
things
the
colonial
board
will
check
oh
i
sure
they
ok
pop
we
listened
to
each
one
after
placed
it
but
cases
have
been
known
where
a
sender
failed
especially
those
on
extremely
hot
or
exceptionally
cold
planets
i
not
doubting
that
you
handled
them
all
right
it
just
that
i
think
it
worth
the
time
and
effort
to
check
them
and
make
sure
while
we
still
out
here
all
right
you
the
captain
jon
opened
the
drawer
in
the
control
desk
and
hunted
out
the
sheets
on
which
he
had
figured
his
former
flight
plans
to
the
various
planets
we
wo
need
to
land
if
the
signals
are
working
his
father
said
just
get
us
close
enough
in
line
so
we
can
receive
the
messages
in
that
case
we
can
fly
almost
by
sight
merely
taking
into
consideration
the
direction
and
speed
of
the
planets
jon
shoved
his
papers
back
into
the
drawer
let
see
we
make
the
best
time
going
to
one
then
the
sun
then
three
four
and
five
and
then
circling
about
and
heading
for
home
fine
get
going
strap
down
everybody
a
quick
glance
to
see
that
they
were
all
secure
then
jon
closed
the
master
switch
of
his
new
interlocking
controls
smoothly
with
increasing
acceleration
the
lifted
upward
through
the
atmosphere
on
the
planet
marci
carveria
two
ever
more
swiftly
it
flew
and
a
special
sort
of
gladness
was
in
each
heart
at
the
thought
that
soon
they
would
be
once
more
speeding
toward
their
home
on
far
distant
terra
traveling
about
the
universe
seeing
new
suns
new
planets
new
and
interesting
even
though
alien
and
sometimes
dangerous
forms
of
life
of
various
kinds
all
this
was
a
constant
source
of
interest
and
delight
still
there
was
within
each
of
them
even
tad
carver
a
love
of
and
a
longing
for
the
planet
that
had
given
them
birth
men
had
always
found
it
so
it
was
probable
that
men
born
on
terra
always
would
probable
too
that
men
born
on
other
planets
would
always
long
for
a
return
to
mother
world
it
took
a
special
type
of
person
to
become
a
colonist
on
another
and
alien
planet
much
the
same
type
of
pioneer
as
those
many
times
removed
who
had
made
the
terrible
journey
across
the
western
plains
and
mountains
of
noramer
to
conquer
the
great
west
and
forefathers
and
mothers
who
had
braved
the
perilous
and
unknown
oceans
to
come
from
the
old
to
the
new
world
in
colonial
days
to
search
for
freedom
and
opportunity
it
had
been
found
that
even
among
those
willing
to
make
the
sacrifices
and
uprootings
necessary
to
become
colonists
on
other
worlds
there
were
always
a
few
who
realized
they
could
not
stand
it
after
all
these
unfortunate
people
usually
returned
to
terra
if
they
had
the
funds
to
do
so
nor
did
it
seem
to
matter
how
much
this
new
planet
was
like
earth
nor
how
great
the
opportunities
for
gaining
wealth
and
prestige
it
was
that
inner
feeling
of
always
that
they
were
so
far
from
home
and
everything
and
everyone
they
had
formerly
known
and
loved
tad
carver
was
a
true
son
of
wanderlust
he
had
the
itching
foot
the
urge
to
travel
the
zest
for
new
places
new
scenes
new
outlooks
but
even
he
after
a
certain
time
away
felt
that
indefinable
yet
exceedingly
strong
to
return
to
his
home
world
for
a
while
the
boys
were
young
which
meant
they
were
eager
for
new
experiences
whether
on
their
own
or
other
worlds
they
had
not
yet
come
to
an
age
where
terra
meant
a
great
deal
to
them
life
was
so
thrilling
so
interesting
there
was
so
much
to
see
and
do
yet
even
they
did
feel
nostalgia
after
too
long
an
absence
it
was
marci
carver
who
felt
it
most
this
longing
this
for
the
old
home
while
it
is
true
that
her
great
love
for
her
husband
and
sons
made
home
for
her
any
place
in
the
universe
where
they
might
be
yet
she
had
no
real
interest
in
exploration
no
great
desire
or
even
curiosity
to
see
other
lands
or
other
worlds
the
deeps
of
space
brought
such
an
to
her
that
they
almost
made
her
afraid
no
if
her
menfolk
had
been
satisfied
there
she
would
never
have
dreamed
of
leaving
earth
she
would
have
been
perfectly
content
to
live
in
one
town
or
city
all
her
life
in
the
same
house
even
she
did
not
have
the
pioneer
spirit
did
not
in
the
least
desire
new
scenes
her
home
and
her
man
and
boys
these
were
all
she
asked
of
life
yet
she
did
have
the
rare
knack
of
making
any
place
where
she
might
be
home
she
could
make
a
mansion
or
a
hovel
or
this
spaceship
seem
such
a
perfect
home
to
her
men
that
they
were
perfectly
happy
and
contented
with
their
living
quarters
it
was
not
a
matter
of
furnishings
or
their
arrangement
not
just
material
things
like
pictures
books
pillows
or
other
knickknacks
placed
just
so
rather
it
was
the
spirit
of
home
with
which
she
impregnated
every
place
in
which
her
family
might
be
living
at
the
moment
the
boys
had
not
yet
noticed
this
consciously
they
were
so
filled
with
the
joy
of
living
and
doing
and
learning
that
they
had
not
yet
stopped
to
think
about
such
matters
but
tad
carver
recognized
it
and
loved
his
wife
all
the
more
because
of
her
ability
he
often
remarked
of
her
put
her
in
even
a
hotel
room
for
ten
minutes
and
she
make
it
home
for
me
he
sometimes
felt
moments
of
guilt
that
he
made
her
chase
around
so
much
instead
of
letting
her
stay
in
one
place
and
remaining
with
her
there
but
he
could
not
stay
put
and
he
knew
she
would
not
want
to
remain
any
place
without
him
that
was
why
he
had
arranged
things
so
she
and
the
boys
could
travel
with
him
and
until
he
had
been
hurt
and
she
with
the
boys
had
had
to
take
over
his
duties
she
had
seldom
left
the
ship
while
on
other
planets
although
she
always
looked
out
through
port
or
visiplate
in
the
various
places
where
they
had
gone
with
the
keen
interest
in
anything
new
that
made
her
such
a
delightful
traveling
companion
so
now
all
four
felt
that
eagerness
to
be
done
with
this
matter
of
so
they
could
be
on
their
way
back
to
terra
it
made
the
time
pass
swiftly
yet
made
it
so
draggingly
prolonged
it
seemed
they
would
never
reach
their
destination
the
ship
soon
reached
an
acceleration
of
two
earth
gravities
and
jon
asked
is
this
fast
enough
pop
or
can
you
stand
more
you
might
step
it
up
to
three
g
for
an
hour
there
no
use
loafing
around
here
longer
than
necessary
to
make
the
curve
so
we
can
come
fairly
near
each
planet
on
the
line
between
it
and
terra
and
that
get
us
up
to
cruising
speed
quicker
when
we
do
start
the
straight
stretch
for
home
jon
said
and
turned
back
to
his
controls
to
apply
another
notch
of
speed
it
was
not
long
before
they
approached
planet
one
tad
jon
had
plotted
a
course
that
would
take
them
to
within
about
thirty
thousand
miles
of
the
little
hot
planet
on
the
earthward
side
as
they
flashed
past
it
their
receiver
clearly
picked
up
the
broadcast
of
their
that
one
all
right
their
father
said
in
a
pleased
voice
and
jon
looked
up
and
back
from
his
calculations
on
the
orbit
to
circle
them
about
the
sun
to
grin
his
pleasure
at
the
approval
jak
put
it
on
top
of
a
peak
in
the
intermediate
zone
he
explained
the
weather
if
you
can
call
it
weather
there
is
more
nearly
normal
than
either
on
the
sunward
or
the
spaceward
side
an
hour
later
jak
struggled
up
from
his
chair
staggering
beneath
the
triple
weight
of
his
body
at
that
acceleration
seeing
him
jon
called
wait
owl
i
just
about
to
reduce
to
two
g
and
in
a
moment
the
older
boy
found
it
easier
to
get
the
sandwiches
and
bottles
of
nourishing
broth
their
mother
had
prepared
before
and
distribute
them
to
the
others
gratefully
they
all
ate
and
drank
after
we
circle
the
sun
and
are
en
route
to
three
i
cut
down
to
one
gravity
while
we
have
a
real
meal
jon
promised
aw
let
not
slow
down
just
for
jak
began
it
wo
cut
our
speed
just
our
acceleration
which
means
added
speed
his
father
explained
as
soon
as
passed
them
all
and
are
heading
for
home
we
cut
to
one
gravity
for
the
greater
part
of
the
trip
but
our
speed
will
have
been
built
up
tremendously
oh
sure
i
know
that
but
i
forgot
for
the
minute
as
they
circled
toward
the
sun
mr
carver
studied
it
carefully
in
his
visiplate
just
about
the
same
type
of
sun
as
sol
he
said
after
a
while
that
what
i
figured
only
that
it
about
one
quarter
larger
and
heavier
jon
told
him
i
was
hoping
you
be
well
enough
before
we
left
to
check
it
for
me
how
close
did
you
set
your
orbit
here
ten
million
miles
million
the
man
gasped
then
laughed
in
relief
as
he
thought
the
boy
was
just
trying
to
spoof
him
oh
come
off
it
jon
how
far
out
were
you
really
unless
my
figures
are
all
wrong
jon
voice
held
a
hurt
note
it
was
really
only
ten
million
miles
you
can
check
my
calculations
the
book
says
quote
said
orbit
to
be
as
nearly
circular
and
as
close
to
the
discovered
sun
as
possible
unquote
so
i
sent
us
in
on
a
van
sicklenberg
orbit
apexing
at
ten
million
boy
that
was
really
taking
a
chance
you
do
need
to
repeat
it
for
my
benefit
i
was
planning
to
sir
jon
grinned
now
we
go
around
at
about
twenty
million
this
time
but
the
same
type
of
orbit
as
before
that
better
well
i
think
i
go
back
to
sleep
all
of
us
should
i
suggest
mother
has
already
dropped
off
jak
said
softly
glancing
toward
the
recline
seat
in
which
she
lay
switch
on
the
auto
chubby
then
douse
the
glotubes
father
and
soon
the
little
ship
was
speeding
across
the
interplanetary
wastes
guided
only
by
the
automatic
pilot
while
inside
four
weary
people
slept
peacefully
knowing
the
mechanisms
would
guide
them
safely
and
surely
to
their
distant
plotted
destination
for
outside
of
a
possible
recurrence
of
the
accident
that
had
caused
mr
carver
injury
and
that
was
a
chance
that
could
not
possibly
strike
them
again
what
was
there
to
fear
away
out
here
nevertheless
it
was
the
sudden
ringing
of
an
alarm
bell
that
woke
them
all
into
instant
wondering
wakefulness
what
in
the
world
jon
eyes
snapped
open
and
immediately
began
scanning
the
various
telltales
on
the
panel
while
from
the
other
three
came
a
chorused
what
wrong
something
out
here
using
atomic
energy
jon
surprised
voice
made
them
raise
their
seats
quickly
to
upright
so
they
could
better
see
for
themselves
mr
carver
hastily
adjusted
his
visiplate
to
maximum
magnification
and
began
searching
the
heavens
surrounding
them
a
ship
you
think
yes
and
quite
close
and
a
moment
later
aided
more
surely
by
his
more
complex
instruments
jon
cried
there
it
is
ra
square
on
the
plate
his
father
flying
fingers
found
the
object
then
narrowed
his
focus
of
vision
and
stepped
up
the
magnification
his
eyes
grew
large
then
hard
and
tense
as
he
studied
the
image
slik
ship
i
know
that
anywhere
he
exclaimed
and
the
boys
looked
at
him
in
puzzled
concern
then
i
must
have
been
right
that
day
i
thought
i
heard
a
ship
mrs
carver
declared
you
must
have
been
jak
agreed
but
what
bogin
doing
out
here
jon
asked
with
a
touch
of
fear
in
his
voice
nothing
good
you
can
bet
his
father
voice
was
grimmer
than
any
of
them
had
ever
heard
it
before
any
time
you
run
across
that
pirate
you
can
lay
mighty
big
odds
there
skullduggery
afoot
great
catfish
he
trying
to
beat
us
out
of
this
system
i
lay
a
thousand
to
one
he
is
if
he
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
it
what
can
we
do
about
it
father
there
was
now
a
trace
of
a
tremor
in
jak
voice
jon
and
i
have
worked
so
hard
to
map
these
planets
how
can
bogin
possibly
do
the
same
and
still
beat
us
no
telling
he
a
slippery
cuss
and
if
he
really
wants
to
try
he
figure
out
some
dirty
scheme
ca
we
get
back
to
earth
ahead
of
him
and
report
to
the
colonial
board
first
mrs
carver
was
almost
in
tears
her
husband
gave
her
a
smile
we
sure
try
honey
his
forehead
creased
with
a
frown
of
concentration
for
some
minutes
then
he
faced
jon
who
was
watching
him
from
the
pilot
seat
bogin
headed
in
the
opposite
direction
so
no
use
chasing
him
to
see
what
he
doing
besides
i
heard
his
ship
is
armed
and
we
are
except
for
our
rifles
which
are
absolutely
no
good
in
space
i
say
continue
our
course
checking
our
signals
then
beat
it
for
home
after
all
we
do
for
sure
that
bogin
trying
anything
and
our
best
bet
is
to
finish
our
job
as
though
nothing
had
happened
but
not
waste
any
time
doing
it
just
in
case
right
pop
as
near
as
i
could
tell
we
have
twice
his
speed
and
we
do
need
to
worry
we
have
all
the
data
and
pictures
to
prove
the
prime
discoverers
and
we
did
hear
any
signals
to
show
he
put
out
any
senders
but
there
was
an
uneasy
and
unhappy
silence
as
the
little
continued
to
eat
up
the
millions
of
miles
tad
carver
had
intended
having
his
younger
son
slow
down
near
planet
three
and
go
into
an
orbit
close
enough
so
he
could
get
a
good
generalized
view
of
this
other
earthlike
though
colder
planet
but
now
he
would
not
do
so
speed
and
time
were
essential
in
getting
back
to
terra
he
would
try
to
keep
his
worries
from
the
others
as
much
as
possible
but
there
was
a
deep
foreboding
in
his
mind
only
too
well
he
knew
the
various
types
of
men
who
braved
the
spaceways
and
that
many
of
them
were
out
and
out
criminals
and
this
slik
bogin
was
the
most
ruthless
pirate
and
cutthroat
of
them
all
from
reports
there
were
so
many
many
crimes
charged
against
him
though
it
was
true
that
none
had
ever
been
proven
yet
such
was
the
evil
reputation
that
all
honest
spacemen
hated
him
even
as
they
were
somewhat
in
fear
of
him
mr
carver
was
sure
that
the
man
spacer
was
almost
a
warship
in
her
armament
nor
did
he
doubt
that
the
master
criminal
would
not
hesitate
to
use
his
heavy
rays
to
blast
out
of
existence
anyone
he
felt
was
a
menace
to
his
nefarious
plans
and
this
new
system
the
carvers
had
discovered
was
a
prize
well
worth
stealing
if
possible
although
mr
carver
had
not
seen
these
splendid
worlds
with
his
own
eyes
he
had
carefully
studied
the
boys
concise
and
complete
reports
and
their
many
detailed
pictures
so
he
knew
what
a
rich
treasure
they
had
struck
in
finding
this
sun
and
its
planets
and
moons
it
would
make
him
and
his
family
rich
beyond
their
fondest
dreams
and
he
would
be
worse
than
flat
broke
if
they
lost
out
on
getting
their
claim
approved
for
mr
carver
had
not
told
even
his
wife
that
all
their
possessions
including
their
ship
were
mortgaged
for
every
credit
he
could
secure
to
enable
them
to
make
this
costly
journey
it
was
true
he
had
won
great
wealth
on
his
previous
trips
into
space
but
several
of
his
largest
investments
on
terra
had
gone
sour
and
this
was
a
last
desperate
chance
to
recoup
his
fortune
in
one
intensive
campaign
as
they
neared
the
point
in
their
trajectory
that
brought
them
to
the
earthward
side
of
planet
three
jon
began
tuning
his
receiver
and
turning
his
directional
so
he
could
pick
up
the
continuous
message
of
their
sender
soon
he
began
hearing
words
and
tuned
more
closely
stepping
up
his
power
the
four
sat
erect
expectant
then
their
faces
blanched
and
their
fists
tightened
as
they
heard
the
words
this
sun
and
system
of
five
planets
of
which
this
is
the
third
were
discovered
and
surveyed
by
michael
bogin
and
his
crew
on
the
tenth
day
of
january
in
the
terran
year
of
over
and
over
the
message
was
repeated
while
the
carvers
stared
at
each
other
in
horrified
surprise
and
consternation
but
mr
carver
rallied
quickly
he
has
changed
the
tape
in
your
senders
boys
we
probably
find
the
same
on
four
and
five
and
on
his
way
to
two
now
to
do
the
same
but
he
not
be
able
to
change
the
one
we
set
out
around
the
sun
will
he
pop
jon
voice
quavered
and
broke
into
a
boyish
soprano
he
ca
get
in
as
close
as
we
did
and
still
slow
down
enough
to
retrieve
such
a
small
thing
can
he
i
do
see
how
he
could
but
he
has
some
darned
good
technies
in
that
pirate
crew
of
his
they
figure
out
some
way
to
destroy
ours
and
substitute
one
of
their
own
i
bet
well
this
changes
the
picture
now
we
know
what
he
up
to
so
we
just
have
to
get
to
terra
ahead
of
him
and
lay
our
facts
before
the
board
first
they
take
our
word
against
his
wo
they
especially
since
we
have
such
complete
records
and
so
many
photographs
jak
asked
hoping
to
be
reassured
there
no
telling
mr
carver
spoke
slowly
shaking
his
head
if
bogin
is
trying
to
get
this
claim
and
now
we
know
he
is
he
work
out
some
way
of
getting
pictures
and
records
too
we
can
only
hope
and
pray
their
mother
added
determinedly
we
make
out
some
way
jon
tried
to
cheer
them
all
meanwhile
i
suggest
i
cut
to
one
g
and
that
mom
fixes
us
some
grub
we
have
to
eat
that
a
good
idea
his
father
agreed
and
jon
manipulated
his
controls
they
all
felt
the
sudden
relief
of
once
more
being
their
accustomed
weight
mrs
carver
unstrapped
herself
and
left
for
the
galley
jak
also
unstrapped
saying
i
go
help
mom
ask
her
to
make
a
pile
of
sandwiches
too
and
to
bring
plenty
of
drinks
so
we
can
eat
later
without
slowing
our
acceleration
his
father
called
then
added
do
let
your
mother
talk
about
this
get
her
mind
on
something
else
and
keep
it
there
right
father
this
is
serious
jon
mr
carver
said
when
the
two
were
alone
in
the
control
room
i
do
like
to
worry
any
of
you
any
more
necessary
but
our
chances
are
too
good
now
that
those
signals
have
been
changed
we
got
some
hope
left
though
have
we
came
the
anxious
inquiry
i
see
two
fairly
good
ones
but
it
all
depends
on
so
many
factors
mr
carver
answered
after
a
moment
of
thought
we
got
to
try
to
get
back
first
and
report
and
show
them
our
records
and
pictures
which
are
very
detailed
thanks
to
you
two
boys
second
we
got
to
hope
someone
back
there
caught
our
original
signals
and
then
noticed
the
change
they
could
tell
they
came
from
the
same
system
how
are
you
making
out
under
this
acceleration
all
right
i
do
seem
to
be
any
weaker
but
then
what
with
all
the
excitement
and
disappointment
there
may
be
a
relapse
but
not
important
then
hearing
his
son
gasp
of
dismay
he
continued
rapidly
and
grimly
no
jon
really
i
mean
that
and
i
want
you
to
keep
it
in
mind
at
all
times
on
the
rest
of
this
trip
i
expendable
if
we
can
prove
our
case
not
that
i
intend
to
die
he
hastened
to
add
with
a
grin
as
jon
started
to
protest
but
i
rather
take
longer
to
get
well
and
know
that
you
all
are
provided
for
the
way
you
should
be
if
we
cut
for
terra
right
away
without
waiting
to
go
on
to
four
and
five
bogin
could
possibly
build
up
speed
enough
to
beat
us
in
could
he
jon
questioned
anxiously
not
unless
his
ship
a
lot
faster
than
ours
it
probably
is
because
his
crew
can
undoubtedly
stand
more
acceleration
and
he
drive
to
the
limit
but
if
he
stops
to
change
those
other
signals
i
do
see
how
he
can
do
it
go
ahead
change
course
and
let
hike
for
home
right
let
see
now
terra
behind
and
down
from
where
we
are
and
the
way
we
heading
i
set
us
into
a
circle
while
we
figuring
out
our
course
make
it
just
an
approximation
for
now
we
can
refine
it
as
we
go
right
jon
worked
swiftly
at
his
computer
then
at
his
controls
and
they
could
feel
the
gallant
little
ship
begin
to
strain
toward
the
right
do
try
too
short
a
turn
his
father
warned
ok
i
let
up
a
bit
i
was
figuring
on
a
two
million
radius
better
make
it
three
for
safety
in
time
their
circling
was
completed
the
new
homeward
bound
course
figured
for
days
the
little
ship
and
its
anxious
crew
were
on
their
way
three
times
each
day
their
acceleration
was
stepped
up
to
two
for
a
period
of
four
hours
then
back
to
one
and
a
quarter
for
the
same
period
four
on
and
four
off
continually
to
give
them
a
rest
from
the
burden
of
doubled
weight
and
to
make
it
easier
to
prepare
and
eat
their
meals
and
to
do
what
personal
and
ship
chores
had
to
be
done
in
between
times
as
they
could
they
slept
jon
had
set
their
receptor
and
analyzer
to
react
to
atomics
it
was
now
fanning
out
behind
them
in
a
funnel
of
force
he
hoped
by
this
to
be
able
to
tell
if
bogin
began
overtaking
them
of
course
space
was
so
vast
and
the
distance
to
sol
and
terra
so
great
and
their
points
of
trajectory
so
different
that
the
pirate
ship
might
be
taking
an
entirely
different
course
and
not
come
anywhere
near
them
until
the
two
ships
were
almost
home
on
the
other
hand
jon
was
taking
the
most
direct
route
and
he
was
sure
bogin
would
undoubtedly
do
the
same
so
they
were
quite
apt
to
converge
sooner
or
later
and
since
jon
receptors
covered
an
sphere
of
space
the
farther
away
they
reached
he
and
his
father
hoped
they
would
be
able
to
tell
if
and
when
their
enemy
began
catching
up
with
them
meantime
the
two
studied
almost
continuously
together
the
problem
of
that
supposedly
new
they
had
discovered
on
the
planet
marci
hoping
it
could
be
used
in
their
engines
they
were
sadly
handicapped
both
because
neither
was
an
atomic
physicist
and
because
their
little
ship
and
provided
with
many
instruments
as
it
was
did
not
contain
anywhere
near
all
the
testing
equipment
needed
for
such
a
delicate
and
complex
and
dangerous
task
yet
they
learned
much
jak
took
over
the
routine
duties
of
their
flight
after
some
additional
instruction
on
points
about
which
he
was
not
sure
in
between
times
as
the
lessened
pressure
allowed
he
studied
the
new
specimens
he
had
collected
saw
to
it
that
the
ship
hydroponics
kept
operating
correctly
and
did
whatever
he
could
to
relieve
his
brother
and
his
father
of
their
ordinary
duties
so
they
could
devote
all
their
waking
time
to
study
and
experiment
their
mother
attended
to
her
housekeeping
and
saw
to
the
comfort
and
of
her
menfolk
mr
carver
knew
deep
within
himself
that
he
was
overdoing
considering
his
illness
his
broken
leg
so
often
pained
and
throbbed
that
he
had
difficulty
concealing
his
hurt
from
the
sharp
eyes
of
his
family
but
he
loved
his
wife
and
sons
so
greatly
that
their
future
was
far
more
important
to
him
than
his
own
and
so
he
never
mentioned
these
things
the
sturdy
little
yacht
had
covered
almost
half
the
tremendous
distance
back
to
sol
the
carvers
were
beginning
to
let
up
a
bit
in
their
anxiety
and
fears
surely
each
one
felt
they
were
winning
the
race
then
suddenly
their
alarm
rang
three
of
them
found
themselves
on
their
feet
rushing
toward
the
control
panel
how
close
are
they
jon
their
father
yelled
from
his
couch
i
stepped
this
up
about
two
hundred
per
cent
i
figure
it
about
half
a
billion
miles
not
very
far
in
space
they
must
have
lots
more
speed
than
we
do
to
have
caught
up
with
us
like
that
what
shall
we
do
mrs
carver
grabbed
her
husband
arm
with
trembling
fingers
he
turned
his
head
and
smiled
up
at
her
we
figure
out
some
way
to
beat
them
honey
he
soothed
there
lots
more
can
be
done
yet
sure
mom
they
still
a
long
way
behind
us
jon
tried
to
keep
the
anxiety
out
of
his
voice
and
you
know
the
old
saying
stern
chase
is
a
long
chase
ca
we
increase
our
acceleration
and
so
our
speed
jak
asked
yes
we
have
to
do
that
at
least
mr
carver
voice
was
grim
he
looked
at
jon
step
it
up
to
two
and
a
half
as
soon
as
you
all
in
your
seats
we
stay
there
more
of
the
time
from
now
on
and
change
the
period
to
six
in
and
two
up
how
about
one
and
a
half
for
the
two
hours
we
try
it
if
we
sleep
or
nap
more
while
we
at
max
we
ought
to
be
able
to
stand
it
we
still
almost
jon
figured
rapidly
at
the
computer
three
weeks
out
of
terra
even
at
that
increased
speed
his
father
grimaced
while
his
wife
and
elder
son
uttered
gasps
of
dismay
i
know
it
be
tough
but
we
to
win
but
after
a
moment
he
looked
first
at
his
wife
than
at
jak
this
is
an
order
he
said
seriously
the
minute
any
of
you
feel
you
take
it
any
more
say
so
and
we
cut
down
even
if
we
do
lose
speed
i
guess
i
went
off
just
now
in
saying
that
we
had
to
win
our
health
is
more
important
except
yours
you
trying
to
say
jak
broke
in
you
have
been
sparing
yourself
any
i
notice
and
i
know
enough
doctoring
to
know
you
not
getting
well
as
fast
pooh
i
all
right
and
i
used
to
ship
accelerations
mr
carver
turned
his
head
toward
his
son
and
made
himself
grin
even
under
these
three
g
i
can
still
get
up
and
lick
you
even
with
a
leg
jon
realized
at
once
that
his
father
was
warning
him
not
to
worry
their
mother
any
more
and
forced
himself
to
reply
pretending
to
be
shamefaced
yes
sir
you
could
at
that
i
be
good
but
the
next
morning
by
the
ship
chronoms
after
they
had
fully
awakened
from
a
night
of
tortured
sleep
jon
studied
his
instruments
for
some
time
then
reported
to
his
father
bogin
still
catching
up
he
only
about
four
hundred
million
behind
us
now
but
how
can
he
possibly
be
jak
demanded
probably
staying
on
three
g
or
better
all
the
time
jon
answered
or
else
he
has
a
different
means
of
propulsion
than
we
have
that
affects
his
whole
ship
and
contents
including
crew
his
father
said
slowly
i
do
know
what
it
could
be
but
theoretically
there
are
a
lot
of
different
ways
of
traveling
faster
than
any
we
learned
how
to
use
yet
but
how
could
they
mr
his
wife
gasped
i
do
pretend
to
know
much
about
such
things
but
i
thought
that
better
fuels
merely
meant
increased
efficiency
in
the
use
of
the
engines
not
an
increase
of
speed
is
it
acceleration
that
makes
the
speed
faster
he
turned
his
head
with
difficulty
at
three
gravities
acceleration
their
apparent
weight
was
tripled
and
his
body
now
weighed
over
five
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
instead
of
its
normal
one
eighty
plus
you
both
right
and
wrong
honey
he
explained
the
better
the
fuel
the
less
we
have
to
carry
for
the
same
distance
traveled
and
that
makes
our
ratio
less
we
can
go
home
faster
than
we
came
out
here
because
some
of
our
fuel
is
gone
and
we
have
less
mass
but
that
not
what
i
talking
about
theoretically
as
i
said
there
are
other
ways
none
of
which
our
scientists
have
yet
figured
out
how
to
use
as
far
as
i
know
there
could
be
a
complete
or
partial
nullification
of
gravity
or
of
inertia
or
some
type
of
space
warp
or
some
method
of
through
the
other
dimensions
so
we
could
go
almost
instantly
from
one
point
in
space
to
another
jak
gasped
why
how
that
possible
father
jon
answered
quickly
i
can
illustrate
i
think
imagine
a
sheet
of
paper
with
a
dot
near
either
end
the
normal
way
to
connect
them
would
be
a
straight
line
drawn
from
one
to
the
other
which
is
analogous
to
the
way
we
travel
in
space
now
what
pop
talking
about
would
be
the
same
as
if
we
folded
the
paper
so
the
two
dots
touched
and
moved
from
one
to
the
other
direct
that
would
be
that
silly
the
two
phrases
came
simultaneously
from
jak
and
his
mother
it
not
silly
honey
we
merely
have
figured
out
how
to
do
it
yet
but
theoretical
science
knows
that
there
are
in
space
we
just
have
learned
how
to
use
them
yet
no
jak
snorted
and
i
bet
you
never
do
and
i
bet
they
will
jon
blazed
you
just
do
realize
how
wonderful
science
is
in
other
lines
than
your
own
i
mean
you
think
it
perfectly
natural
that
medical
science
has
made
such
tremendous
advances
in
the
past
couple
of
centuries
why
should
other
branches
make
just
as
great
strides
because
the
advances
in
medicine
and
surgery
have
been
logical
his
brother
began
hotly
but
their
father
interrupted
whoa
now
boys
do
get
started
on
an
endless
argument
you
both
right
and
both
wrong
i
admit
that
the
three
methods
i
mentioned
are
pretty
but
after
all
science
is
always
doing
the
unexpected
and
the
impossible
there
no
telling
what
they
do
next
not
even
of
telling
what
they
may
have
done
while
we
been
gone
i
read
about
that
thing
jon
stated
it
was
a
concept
about
being
able
to
reproduce
the
exact
nucleonic
pattern
of
some
other
space
and
thus
being
able
to
transfer
to
it
instantly
another
idea
is
of
a
or
method
of
transversing
space
at
almost
instantaneous
speeds
and
many
other
such
mr
carver
declared
but
it
a
cinch
none
of
us
have
brains
enough
to
figure
out
any
of
them
before
we
reach
terra
and
that
bogin
not
using
any
of
them
either
since
he
so
apparently
on
a
flight
like
we
are
he
may
have
better
engines
or
better
fuel
but
to
overtake
us
like
he
is
now
that
i
stopped
to
think
about
it
can
only
be
done
by
using
greater
acceleration
than
we
are
and
for
a
longer
time
so
while
those
other
ideas
are
interesting
conjectures
they
wo
help
us
out
of
our
present
predicament
that
right
pop
jon
wrenched
his
mind
back
to
their
immediate
problem
we
got
to
figure
out
what
we
can
do
to
beat
bogin
they
all
lapsed
into
silence
then
partly
to
think
of
their
problem
and
partly
because
their
personal
energy
was
weakened
by
the
tremendous
pressures
they
were
undergoing
their
new
schedule
was
hard
on
them
all
none
of
them
were
really
rested
even
though
they
now
slept
or
dozed
most
of
the
time
but
they
were
keeping
more
nearly
ahead
although
when
jon
took
his
next
readings
bogin
ship
had
crept
up
another
third
of
a
hundred
million
miles
that
means
he
catch
up
with
and
pass
us
in
about
eleven
days
and
we
still
almost
twenty
out
of
terra
jon
could
not
entirely
keep
the
worry
out
of
his
voice
during
the
noon
respite
according
to
ship
time
they
cut
their
acceleration
to
one
and
a
half
and
mrs
carver
prepared
a
hot
meal
and
cold
lunches
for
the
balance
of
that
day
while
they
were
eating
there
in
the
control
room
jak
suddenly
looked
up
at
his
father
i
just
wondered
sir
how
much
pressure
could
a
person
stand
for
long
periods
if
he
was
unconscious
under
some
kind
of
an
anaesthetic
why
the
elder
hesitated
i
do
know
exactly
i
imagine
around
five
gravities
or
so
if
it
was
to
be
for
some
time
especially
if
one
was
in
a
pressure
pack
why
do
you
ask
i
been
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
and
i
remembered
reading
about
a
series
of
experiments
a
swedish
scientist
has
been
making
about
putting
animals
even
people
into
an
unconscious
state
it
in
one
of
my
reelbooks
seems
to
me
i
remember
its
saying
he
has
found
he
could
keep
them
there
for
several
days
at
a
time
without
any
sign
of
permanent
harm
how
he
do
it
jon
dropped
his
fork
to
lean
forward
with
a
drug
he
invented
wait
i
go
get
the
book
jak
jumped
up
from
the
table
but
his
mother
voice
stopped
him
we
not
going
to
try
anything
like
that
she
said
worriedly
not
even
to
beat
bogin
mr
carver
reached
out
from
his
recline
seat
to
lay
a
hand
soothingly
on
his
wife
wait
now
marci
let
find
out
first
what
this
is
all
about
maybe
the
boy
has
something
maybe
not
but
let
examine
it
before
we
decide
shall
we
her
eyes
still
held
the
worried
look
but
she
returned
the
pressure
of
his
hand
well
i
guess
there
no
harm
in
that
but
i
just
do
like
taking
dangerous
chances
that
all
he
smiled
at
her
fondly
pioneers
always
have
to
take
chances
honey
he
said
gently
men
would
never
have
gotten
anywhere
if
they
had
but
we
make
sure
we
know
all
about
what
we
getting
into
before
we
leap
you
can
bet
besides
jon
tried
to
reassure
her
even
if
this
stuff
would
work
owl
has
any
of
that
new
drug
so
we
could
try
it
much
as
we
might
want
to
oh
that
right
i
had
thought
of
that
she
smiled
with
relief
in
a
moment
jak
came
running
back
with
a
reelbook
here
it
is
see
now
he
rapidly
scanned
through
the
reel
with
his
finder
ah
here
it
is
he
read
aloud
rapidly
and
the
three
listened
intently
so
you
see
jak
raised
his
head
triumphantly
when
he
had
finished
reading
it
perfectly
possible
to
put
us
to
sleep
for
a
week
at
a
time
and
you
said
the
ship
was
fully
automatic
he
turned
to
jon
so
it
does
need
guiding
and
would
keep
on
its
course
whether
we
were
awake
or
not
well
it
way
past
our
two
hours
mr
carver
spoke
up
hastily
to
prevent
his
wife
from
saying
anything
time
we
were
getting
back
into
acceleration
again
strap
down
and
we
can
study
this
later
i
still
do
like
the
idea
mrs
carver
said
as
the
four
made
themselves
as
comfortable
as
possible
in
the
recline
seats
before
jon
turned
on
more
acceleration
during
the
next
two
or
three
waking
periods
jak
busied
himself
studying
his
reeltext
but
this
was
such
a
common
sight
it
attracted
no
special
attention
nor
did
the
others
notice
that
he
began
disappearing
into
the
ship
storeroom
each
up
period
and
had
to
be
called
repeatedly
when
the
meal
was
ready
or
it
was
time
to
strap
down
again
he
said
nothing
of
what
he
was
doing
nor
did
any
of
the
others
think
to
ask
for
the
boys
were
customarily
here
and
there
about
the
ship
busy
at
their
many
tasks
and
activities
but
at
the
start
of
one
up
period
jak
went
at
once
to
the
storeroom
and
workshop
and
when
he
came
back
to
the
table
set
in
the
control
room
he
showed
his
family
a
large
corked
test
tube
filled
with
a
colorless
liquid
i
got
it
he
exclaimed
his
eyes
shining
i
found
all
the
ingredients
needed
in
our
stores
and
my
medical
kit
and
made
up
a
batch
of
the
cataleptic
fluid
we
inject
four
cc
in
each
of
us
and
what
you
talking
about
jon
demanded
the
stuff
to
make
us
unconscious
so
we
can
stand
five
g
of
acceleration
jak
looked
up
in
hurt
surprise
what
we
were
talking
about
the
other
i
thought
we
were
going
to
forget
that
nonsense
his
mother
said
sharply
wait
now
marci
let
hear
what
the
boy
has
her
husband
said
gently
then
go
ahead
jak
tell
us
more
about
this
this
medicine
injected
into
our
blood
streams
puts
us
into
suspended
animation
for
several
days
depending
on
how
much
of
the
fluid
we
use
we
first
take
an
injection
of
glucose
and
other
nutrients
of
course
then
this
stuff
puts
us
into
deep
sleep
slows
our
metabolism
you
said
in
such
a
state
we
could
stand
much
heavier
acceleration
father
then
with
this
we
can
beat
bogin
what
sort
of
shape
will
it
leave
us
in
his
father
almost
raised
up
in
interest
and
held
up
his
hand
when
his
wife
would
have
broken
in
are
there
any
the
book
says
the
doctor
never
discovered
any
especially
after
he
started
giving
people
the
nutrient
injections
first
he
has
had
people
under
for
as
much
as
two
weeks
four
cc
will
act
for
about
five
days
so
i
thought
we
could
use
that
much
the
first
time
at
least
five
g
would
certainly
put
us
ahead
of
bogin
ship
jon
had
jumped
up
from
the
table
and
had
been
working
swiftly
with
the
computer
two
such
periods
three
more
days
on
positive
acceleration
then
seven
on
negative
ought
to
give
us
a
controllable
velocity
somewhere
near
sol
we
have
to
compute
it
more
exactly
of
course
before
we
take
each
shot
mr
carver
thought
slowly
and
intently
then
spoke
decisively
i
believe
that
this
is
our
best
bet
if
it
sure
we
certainly
want
to
get
back
first
if
possible
and
according
to
our
present
routine
which
is
all
we
can
stand
as
we
are
bogin
can
beat
us
in
besides
he
will
undoubtedly
shoot
down
the
if
he
catches
up
with
it
and
you
know
what
would
happen
to
us
yes
when
i
checked
today
he
was
only
about
two
hundred
million
behind
let
try
it
jak
was
all
eagerness
take
it
easy
son
we
got
to
talk
and
study
this
a
lot
first
mr
carver
then
turned
to
his
wife
who
had
sunk
back
into
her
seat
biting
her
lips
to
keep
from
crying
out
her
hands
clenched
tightly
well
make
as
sure
as
we
possibly
can
before
we
decide
to
do
anything
honey
but
do
you
see
the
advantage
of
this
if
it
will
work
we
must
get
to
terra
first
if
we
can
and
this
seems
to
be
the
only
way
we
know
of
doing
it
i
see
that
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
and
i
know
know
what
you
doing
before
you
do
it
we
sure
will
then
mr
carver
turned
back
to
jak
tell
us
again
all
about
this
stuff
and
what
the
book
says
jak
talked
rapidly
but
concisely
for
nearly
five
minutes
afterwards
he
showed
his
father
the
reel
and
his
table
of
components
of
the
mixture
mr
carver
studied
the
book
carefully
for
some
time
and
minutely
compared
the
formula
as
given
there
with
the
one
jak
had
used
then
he
lay
back
and
thought
with
intense
concentration
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
finally
he
raised
his
head
with
determination
i
think
we
should
try
it
it
seems
safe
from
all
the
evidence
here
i
have
faith
enough
in
jak
ability
to
trust
him
to
have
made
the
fluid
correctly
his
formula
checks
exactly
with
the
one
in
the
reels
and
if
it
works
we
can
win
out
jon
rose
purposefully
right
pop
come
on
jak
let
break
out
the
pressure
packs
and
get
them
hung
they
went
into
the
storeroom
and
soon
came
back
each
staggering
under
the
weight
and
inconvenience
of
two
packs
these
they
hung
from
the
bulkhead
hooks
built
into
the
ship
for
just
that
purpose
and
made
sure
they
were
securely
anchored
how
much
time
after
the
injection
before
we
blank
out
owl
jon
asked
then
a
minute
or
so
i
guess
why
figuring
how
long
i
have
to
handle
the
controls
a
minute
is
plenty
of
time
as
i
can
have
everything
set
up
and
only
have
one
switch
to
throw
mr
carver
reached
out
a
hand
and
patted
his
wife
cheek
as
she
stood
by
his
side
it
going
to
work
out
all
right
honey
his
voice
was
bright
and
assured
these
boys
of
ours
are
really
up
on
their
stuff
yes
she
agreed
i
know
they
know
what
they
are
doing
and
that
you
are
checking
them
carefully
it
is
mainly
my
not
knowing
that
makes
me
afraid
sometimes
she
gave
him
a
lopsided
smile
i
hate
being
the
weak
member
of
the
party
you
nothing
of
the
kind
he
grinned
as
the
boys
murmured
protests
which
meant
the
same
thing
you
the
best
fellow
in
the
gang
and
he
blew
her
a
kiss
as
the
boys
helped
him
into
his
pack
and
saw
to
it
that
he
was
securely
and
comfortably
strapped
in
then
they
did
the
same
for
their
mother
jak
went
to
his
room
and
came
back
quickly
with
his
hypodermic
needles
and
the
bottles
of
glucose
and
concentrates
he
put
these
beside
the
test
tube
with
the
new
fluid
carefully
he
administered
the
dosage
of
nutrients
to
the
other
three
then
lay
down
on
his
recline
seat
and
gave
himself
his
own
dose
he
rested
there
for
a
couple
of
minutes
then
rose
carefully
he
drew
four
cubic
centimeters
of
the
new
clear
fluid
into
his
needle
then
approached
his
mother
ready
he
asked
smiling
but
with
tight
lips
she
pushed
up
her
left
sleeve
ready
son
and
now
her
voice
was
soft
but
steady
he
tipped
the
needle
into
the
light
carefully
expelled
a
couple
of
drops
to
make
sure
all
air
was
out
of
the
tube
then
quickly
and
with
a
sureness
he
had
trouble
making
his
hands
achieve
he
pushed
the
slim
needle
into
her
arm
and
injected
the
drug
with
the
ball
of
his
thumb
he
rubbed
the
puncture
gently
for
a
moment
sleep
tight
mother
he
smiled
and
leaned
down
to
kiss
her
who
next
he
turned
to
the
others
me
of
course
his
father
bared
his
arm
jon
has
to
be
awake
last
to
handle
the
controls
again
jak
filled
his
needle
and
as
carefully
as
before
he
injected
the
sleeping
drug
into
his
father
then
he
stepped
up
to
the
pressure
pack
where
his
younger
brother
was
adjusting
the
controls
ready
jon
just
a
sec
the
boy
was
still
working
pushing
in
a
button
there
turning
a
switch
here
stopping
to
tighten
a
wire
or
connection
somewhere
else
but
in
a
few
moments
he
had
finished
and
then
rested
his
right
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
master
switch
ready
to
push
it
into
contact
but
just
as
jak
brought
the
needle
close
to
his
arm
the
younger
boy
pushed
it
away
wait
now
jak
how
about
you
can
you
make
it
to
your
pack
and
get
in
and
strapped
down
and
settled
and
then
give
yourself
the
shot
before
i
throw
the
switch
and
the
five
g
take
effect
do
worry
about
me
his
brother
said
gruffly
i
make
out
some
way
not
good
enough
jon
said
positively
let
figure
this
down
to
seconds
if
i
do
close
the
switch
before
i
black
out
all
be
wasted
how
about
if
you
inject
yourself
first
will
you
have
time
enough
to
give
me
my
shot
and
then
get
back
into
your
pack
and
strap
down
before
you
go
under
jak
thought
swiftly
a
moment
your
point
well
taken
jon
but
you
did
figure
it
right
your
way
i
have
to
give
you
your
injection
besides
doing
all
the
rest
in
the
same
length
of
time
if
i
give
you
yours
first
i
can
get
into
my
pack
and
give
myself
mine
there
you
merely
stay
awake
until
i
done
yes
guess
you
right
but
fix
your
pack
so
you
can
be
sure
of
getting
in
without
any
trouble
jak
did
this
then
came
back
filled
the
needle
and
injected
it
into
jon
arm
swiftly
then
he
ran
to
his
own
pack
climbed
in
and
fastened
the
straps
he
filled
the
needle
plunged
it
into
his
arm
and
pushed
home
the
plunger
jon
had
been
watching
his
brother
forcing
back
the
drowsiness
that
sought
to
engulf
him
as
he
saw
jak
nod
that
all
was
done
he
turned
to
his
panel
a
quick
glance
about
his
board
with
his
senses
told
him
everything
was
on
the
green
with
his
last
measure
of
consciousness
he
rammed
home
the
switch
he
settled
back
into
a
more
comfortable
position
and
felt
himself
plunging
down
into
the
blackness
of
unconsciousness
jon
felt
himself
coming
awake
and
his
first
startled
thought
was
did
the
stuff
work
he
began
to
open
his
eyes
and
noticed
at
once
how
stiff
his
eyelids
felt
but
he
forced
them
open
he
looked
at
the
and
smiled
with
relief
the
five
days
and
several
hours
had
passed
seemingly
in
an
instant
now
almost
fully
awake
his
eyes
sought
the
various
meters
dials
gauges
and
telltales
on
his
panel
everything
seemed
to
be
working
properly
he
tuned
in
his
receptor
and
applied
greater
and
still
greater
power
space
behind
was
blank
of
atomics
smiling
thankfully
and
beginning
to
unloosen
his
straps
jon
now
noticed
how
dry
his
mouth
was
and
that
his
skin
felt
dry
too
and
feverish
but
he
had
no
headache
and
his
thoughts
seemed
to
be
functioning
as
clearly
and
swiftly
as
always
boy
i
sure
need
a
bath
and
drink
and
something
to
eat
he
thought
then
realized
that
the
others
would
be
feeling
the
same
way
the
others
he
turned
quickly
to
look
at
them
they
were
all
still
lying
in
their
packs
somewhat
pale
but
with
a
peaceful
unstrained
look
on
their
faces
jon
tried
to
rise
but
reeled
back
and
almost
fell
as
he
got
onto
his
feet
he
held
himself
erect
a
moment
and
gradually
felt
a
measure
of
strength
returning
as
soon
as
he
could
he
went
into
the
galley
quickly
he
prepared
a
cup
of
instant
broth
and
drank
it
gratefully
much
refreshed
he
made
more
of
the
consomme
and
further
enriched
it
with
some
pills
dissolved
in
the
steaming
liquid
he
set
four
cups
of
it
on
a
tray
and
carried
them
into
the
control
room
his
first
quick
glance
showed
the
others
beginning
to
stir
morning
folks
he
called
cheerily
soup
on
they
opened
their
eyes
slowly
almost
uncomprehendingly
but
awareness
came
quickly
and
his
mother
and
brother
sat
up
and
fumbled
at
their
straps
did
we
make
it
his
father
called
anxiously
but
jak
noticed
at
once
how
weak
his
father
voice
sounded
and
went
across
to
his
side
we
sure
did
jon
smiled
broadly
we
were
out
just
a
little
over
five
days
and
the
receptors
do
show
a
thing
behind
i
woke
up
just
a
few
minutes
ahead
of
you
and
that
one
of
the
first
things
i
looked
at
then
i
found
i
was
weak
and
dry
so
i
went
out
and
made
this
broth
he
passed
the
cups
and
as
the
others
drank
gratefully
jon
spoke
again
i
got
to
hand
it
to
you
owl
you
sure
fixed
us
fine
this
time
he
certainly
did
mr
carver
spoke
as
forcefully
as
he
could
having
already
privately
warned
jak
to
say
nothing
of
his
weakened
condition
he
looked
solicitously
over
at
his
wife
you
all
right
marci
yes
i
feel
fine
now
that
i
had
this
good
consomme
jon
was
so
thoughtful
as
to
make
she
smiled
with
real
relief
that
they
had
all
come
through
this
dangerous
experiment
so
successfully
mr
carver
turned
to
jon
it
feels
like
we
only
at
one
gravity
yes
i
rigged
the
automatics
so
they
take
care
of
that
at
the
end
of
one
hundred
and
hours
the
boy
explained
probably
it
was
the
relief
from
pressure
that
woke
us
as
well
as
the
wearing
off
of
the
stuff
jak
gave
us
then
he
looked
at
his
brother
how
come
not
famished
after
five
days
that
little
glucose
and
stuff
you
gave
us
would
last
that
long
would
it
no
but
the
drug
not
only
made
us
unconscious
but
slowed
down
our
metabolism
so
that
we
burned
up
hardly
any
energy
there
was
silence
then
while
the
four
sipped
their
broth
finally
mr
carver
looked
up
at
jak
how
soon
can
we
go
through
this
again
the
book
says
the
doctor
gave
as
high
as
four
doses
to
people
one
right
after
the
other
as
they
woke
up
with
only
a
few
hours
rest
between
them
then
we
better
take
some
time
out
we
all
want
baths
plenty
of
your
mother
good
cooking
and
jon
and
i
will
have
to
do
some
computing
if
bogin
holds
his
acceleration
plus
and
minus
we
can
take
most
of
the
day
and
still
beat
him
in
jon
had
been
doing
some
rapid
preliminary
figuring
but
it
take
a
couple
of
hours
maybe
more
to
compute
the
last
hop
it
tricky
especially
i
have
to
look
in
the
ephemeris
to
find
the
position
of
luna
when
we
get
near
her
orbit
right
we
do
want
to
hit
her
well
we
can
keep
at
one
gravity
for
at
least
twelve
hours
then
his
father
said
and
mrs
carver
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
she
was
still
a
bit
worried
about
their
undergoing
such
untried
experiments
even
though
she
trusted
the
abilities
of
her
menfolks
and
knew
they
had
all
come
safely
through
the
first
time
i
make
notes
of
all
this
and
ask
each
of
you
for
your
full
reactions
jak
said
animatedly
then
when
we
get
home
i
write
up
a
complete
report
and
send
it
to
svendholm
i
sure
he
be
tickled
pink
to
get
this
added
confirmation
of
his
studies
and
experiments
that
thoughtful
of
you
son
his
father
smiled
you
developing
into
a
true
research
scientist
he
sure
is
his
younger
brother
paid
deserved
tribute
jak
reddened
a
bit
and
hastily
left
the
control
room
to
help
his
mother
with
her
work
they
all
took
warm
baths
and
changed
their
clothing
as
jak
was
helping
his
father
he
asked
anxiously
now
that
we
alone
father
did
you
really
come
through
all
right
you
look
a
bit
more
tired
and
worn
than
before
we
started
this
sure
i
ok
mr
carver
said
quickly
but
he
could
not
meet
his
son
eyes
you
not
sir
and
you
know
it
and
i
know
it
jak
smiled
a
bit
strainedly
i
do
like
it
but
i
know
how
you
feel
about
this
so
i
keep
quiet
how
your
leg
thanks
son
our
getting
back
first
is
very
important
to
me
and
i
can
rest
and
get
well
after
we
reach
earth
and
get
the
board
confirmation
on
our
claim
and
do
forget
that
we
might
not
get
back
at
all
if
bogin
catches
up
with
us
he
ruthless
about
anyone
who
gets
in
his
way
as
for
the
leg
it
aches
some
but
not
like
it
did
before
i
really
think
it
healing
in
fine
shape
let
have
a
look
jak
threw
back
the
covers
and
peered
closely
at
the
leg
lifting
it
so
he
could
better
see
all
around
it
yes
he
said
finally
as
he
tucked
in
the
blankets
again
almost
healed
and
there
is
a
sign
of
inflammation
not
even
a
bump
where
the
break
was
i
i
sure
hope
i
set
it
right
so
that
it
bother
you
later
on
his
father
patted
his
hand
you
did
a
grand
job
i
know
son
and
very
grateful
to
you
as
well
as
proud
of
having
such
a
fine
boy
two
fine
boys
then
for
jon
is
certainly
every
bit
as
deserving
of
your
praise
as
i
am
sir
that
i
certainly
buy
mr
carver
eyes
shone
they
all
sat
about
during
the
day
eating
as
much
as
they
could
hold
of
mrs
carver
fine
cooking
and
relaxing
gratefully
in
the
comfortable
jon
and
his
father
worked
tirelessly
until
they
had
computed
precisely
where
they
were
and
how
soon
and
how
much
more
deceleration
they
would
have
to
use
to
finish
their
trip
then
they
too
relaxed
for
the
balance
of
the
day
late
that
afternoon
jon
suddenly
swiveled
his
chair
about
to
face
his
father
recline
seat
i
think
i
figured
out
something
on
that
new
fuel
and
how
to
use
it
pop
ships
have
to
be
changed
though
the
bins
will
have
to
be
heavily
of
course
and
so
would
the
injector
tubes
have
to
be
shielded
the
nozzles
would
have
to
be
made
smaller
so
the
pellets
will
fit
better
i
figure
the
people
who
used
to
handle
the
stuff
made
the
nuggets
that
exact
size
on
purpose
that
we
not
want
to
try
making
them
the
same
size
as
our
copper
ones
that
sounds
reasonable
what
about
shielding
for
the
generators
there
have
to
be
a
lot
more
of
that
too
probably
thick
shields
of
neocarbolloy
and
paraffin
but
ca
they
surround
the
generators
bins
and
everything
with
force
fields
as
an
added
precaution
maybe
they
could
at
that
we
better
put
it
up
to
the
scientists
and
technies
back
on
terra
neither
of
us
knows
enough
to
handle
it
ourselves
when
it
comes
down
to
the
actual
work
the
boy
face
fell
then
he
forced
a
smile
i
hate
to
give
in
to
anyone
else
on
this
but
you
right
as
rain
pop
it
is
too
big
a
fish
for
us
to
handle
alone
but
i
sure
going
to
learn
before
i
finish
and
some
day
when
i
run
up
against
anything
like
this
again
you
can
bet
i
know
what
to
do
what
the
use
of
going
to
all
that
trouble
when
you
only
have
that
small
amount
of
fuel
you
found
their
mother
asked
curiously
ouch
you
would
have
to
think
of
that
jon
grumbled
but
mr
carver
smiled
up
at
his
wife
there
plenty
on
planet
five
remember
and
probably
in
other
places
about
the
universe
you
can
bet
that
prospectors
will
be
hunting
and
finding
it
once
we
announce
our
discovery
if
we
and
the
scientists
can
figure
out
what
it
was
before
it
started
losing
its
half
life
and
if
we
can
learn
how
to
use
it
he
said
firmly
once
metallurgists
have
had
the
chance
to
analyze
it
they
wo
take
long
to
figure
out
exactly
what
it
is
and
where
it
can
probably
be
found
the
type
of
sun
and
planet
that
would
have
it
i
mean
he
added
and
under
the
prime
discoverer
code
we
get
a
percentage
of
the
process
wo
we
pop
i
think
so
that
be
up
to
the
board
but
they
usually
pretty
square
about
such
things
when
it
was
time
jak
again
gave
the
family
the
dosages
of
nutrients
and
then
the
shots
jon
had
filled
four
thermos
bottles
with
soup
his
mother
had
made
and
these
were
placed
at
each
ready
for
their
awakening
again
the
four
lapsed
into
the
complete
unconsciousness
of
suspended
animation
knowing
neither
discomfort
nor
the
long
passage
of
time
while
their
little
ship
bored
through
the
immensities
of
space
at
a
constant
negative
acceleration
of
five
gravities
as
before
when
they
awakened
they
felt
as
though
they
had
just
gone
to
sleep
as
soon
as
they
had
taken
their
initial
feedings
of
the
broth
jon
and
his
father
set
to
work
taking
observations
and
making
long
and
intricate
calculations
of
their
present
speed
and
placement
where
were
they
how
much
of
their
utterly
incomprehensible
top
speed
did
they
have
left
practically
perfect
jon
exclaimed
happily
after
nearly
an
hour
of
careful
computations
as
he
read
the
last
tapes
from
the
calculator
it
works
out
at
one
point
eight
four
g
to
atmosphere
o
positively
k
mr
carver
agreed
a
master
computer
could
have
done
any
better
and
jak
has
certainly
proved
himself
to
be
a
grand
doctor
it
not
my
credit
svendholm
the
one
who
but
it
was
you
who
made
up
the
fluid
and
induced
us
to
take
it
his
mother
came
over
and
ran
her
hand
gently
through
his
hair
i
proud
of
you
all
jon
had
been
tuning
his
receptors
carefully
but
was
unable
to
get
any
trace
of
bogin
ship
and
all
were
happy
at
his
report
warm
baths
and
changes
of
clothing
and
the
fine
meals
prepared
by
mrs
carver
plus
the
fact
they
were
rapidly
nearing
sol
which
could
be
seen
on
their
telescopic
plates
made
them
all
very
gay
and
full
of
chatter
i
decided
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
and
really
prepare
myself
to
be
a
doctor
jak
said
in
no
uncertain
terms
later
i
want
to
go
into
medical
research
and
i
still
want
to
enroll
at
the
centropolitan
institute
of
atomics
jon
eyes
were
shining
are
you
boys
forgetting
one
little
detail
their
father
asked
drily
while
the
long
sleeps
had
relaxed
his
body
and
had
practically
completed
the
healing
of
his
broken
leg
the
pressure
had
not
been
good
for
him
and
his
condition
as
a
whole
was
worse
but
his
spirits
were
high
and
he
was
careful
not
to
let
any
of
his
family
know
just
how
weak
he
felt
at
his
question
they
all
looked
up
astonished
and
he
continued
there
the
small
matter
of
getting
the
colonial
board
approval
of
our
claim
against
the
we
feel
so
sure
bogin
is
coming
in
to
make
pooh
he
has
got
a
chance
jon
said
airily
you
hope
jak
scoffed
suddenly
serious
and
worried
how
about
it
mr
mrs
carver
asked
our
pictures
and
data
are
so
detailed
i
do
see
how
bogin
can
possibly
match
them
her
husband
answered
slowly
and
thoughtfully
i
think
we
can
prove
our
claim
besides
their
receivers
there
on
terra
should
have
picked
up
the
broadcasts
of
our
signals
and
then
the
change
and
that
should
have
made
them
wonder
why
so
our
explanation
ought
to
satisfy
them
that
reminds
me
jon
swung
back
to
his
panel
let
see
if
we
can
pick
up
our
signals
from
here
or
bogin
rather
his
lips
tightened
in
a
few
moments
his
tubes
had
warmed
up
but
nothing
came
in
over
his
receivers
he
stepped
up
the
power
and
swung
his
directional
loops
forth
and
back
although
mostly
he
aimed
them
directly
toward
the
carveria
system
known
coordinates
for
long
anxious
minutes
he
worked
but
still
no
sounds
save
the
noise
of
cosmic
rays
and
the
other
forces
of
the
void
that
made
communication
such
a
problem
with
a
weary
gesture
jon
finally
turned
off
the
set
and
swung
about
with
a
stricken
face
what
do
you
suppose
is
wrong
pop
the
elder
shook
his
head
slowly
only
thing
i
can
think
of
is
that
we
so
far
away
the
senders
ca
reach
this
far
wo
that
be
in
our
favor
jak
asked
if
they
ca
hear
any
signals
at
all
our
records
ought
to
be
enough
maybe
yes
maybe
no
mr
carver
answered
with
a
tired
smile
and
after
all
our
hard
work
too
jon
tone
was
dispirited
and
the
dangers
you
were
up
against
mrs
carver
eyes
were
their
father
caught
himself
and
looked
at
each
with
a
disarming
grin
hey
we
all
crossing
bridges
where
maybe
there
is
even
a
creek
to
be
spanned
he
made
his
voice
mockingly
cheerful
what
happened
to
the
good
old
carver
spirit
you
right
pop
jon
shook
away
his
dismay
and
began
to
smile
we
not
licked
yet
but
while
they
were
eating
a
short
time
later
jon
turned
his
seat
to
face
his
father
do
like
to
start
worrying
again
pop
he
said
in
a
low
voice
but
our
receptor
is
picking
up
atomic
activity
behind
us
again
of
course
he
added
quickly
this
close
to
terra
it
could
be
some
other
ship
not
bogin
could
be
and
probably
is
his
father
stroked
his
chin
reflectively
i
do
see
how
he
could
caught
up
with
us
but
we
do
know
what
his
ship
can
do
the
guy
tricky
and
dirty
but
he
does
have
a
brain
and
he
has
some
darned
good
technies
in
his
crew
he
know
from
his
own
receptors
when
we
started
speeding
up
so
fast
and
he
do
something
to
counteract
that
if
he
could
i
heard
things
like
that
about
him
but
i
do
know
him
i
do
grimly
we
had
brushes
before
when
i
was
in
other
ships
he
a
skunk
and
ought
to
be
behind
bars
but
so
far
no
one
has
been
able
to
produce
any
real
evidence
of
what
all
spacemen
know
must
be
true
if
the
board
accepts
our
claim
and
data
against
his
wo
that
be
proof
against
him
it
should
be
you
can
bet
your
tackle
i
work
on
that
angle
space
will
be
cleaner
if
that
hellhound
is
in
it
you
bet
pop
i
hope
you
sink
your
hook
in
him
this
time
his
father
laughed
grimly
it
wo
be
for
lack
of
trying
that
for
danged
sure
jon
carver
spoke
into

minutes
instructions

off

jon
sighted
through
his
visiplate
until
he
located
the
cradle
marked
with
a
large
in
the
section
of
the
tremendous
spaceport
also
clearly
marked
he
lowered
the
ship
slowly
and
gently
keeping
his
eyes
closely
on
the
chronom
and
its
big
so
expert
had
he
become
at
handling
the
ship
and
so
well
did
his
new
automatic
technique
work
that
the
ship
settled
gently
into
the
cradle
dead

and
only
one

three

off
the

minutes

chubby
jak
cheered
as
they
felt
the
mighty
engines
and
generators
shut
off
aw
it
was
rotten
i
was
almost
a
second
and
a
half
off
in
my
timing
who
cares
there
was
a
lilt
of
joy
and
pure
thankfulness
in
their
mother
voice
we
are
back
on
earth
home
and
all
of
us
are
whole
that
the
best
part
of
all
her
husband
looked
up
from
the
recline
seat
where
he
was
still
lying
and
winked
at
his
sons
then
he
faced
his
wife
the
eternal
mother
he
smiled
gently
at
her
and
his
voice
was
soft
with
emotion
happiest
when
her
brood
is
safe
and
he
added
hastily
at
the
look
coming
into
her
eyes
how
thankful
mankind
is
or
should
be
that
womenfolk
have
always
had
that
feeling
man
would
never
have
gone
as
far
as
he
has
if
she
had
jak
soon
came
in
from
the
other
part
of
the
ship
all
our
data
books
pictures
and
specimens
are
packed
and
stashed
by
the
inner
lockdoor
he
reported
jon
jumped
from
his
pilot
seat
and
started
toward
the
living
quarters
let
get
our
street
clothes
on
and
get
going
to
the
colonial
board
headquarters
yes
mrs
carver
said
eagerly
after
all
we
gone
through
to
make
sure
we
beat
that
bogin
and
his
ship
back
home
let
not
waste
any
time
well
mr
carver
eyes
twinkled
go
put
on
your
prettiest
frock
and
all
your
war
paint
so
you
can
make
a
good
impression
on
the
board
members
she
krinkled
her
nose
at
him
but
went
in
to
the
bunkroom
mr
carver
raised
his
chair
to
upright
and
began
struggling
to
get
up
the
two
boys
watching
closely
saw
how
weak
he
was
and
ran
to
help
him
with
his
arms
across
their
shoulders
he
finally
managed
to
half
be
carried
into
the
other
room
the
boys
lowered
him
into
a
seat
i
get
your
clean
clothes
and
your
razor
and
some
hot
water
jak
said
jon
went
back
into
the
control
room
and
turned
on
his
service
please
he
said
when
the
operator
came
on
and
in
a
moment
cradle
section
please
have
a
here
in
thirty
minutes
and
a
wheel
chair
with
it
thanks
when
the
four
got
outside
on
the
landing
platform
and
tad
carver
saw
the
wheel
chair
he
was
indignant
i
not
going
to
ride
in
any
lousy
perambulator
he
grumbled
but
the
boys
were
insistent
finally
his
wife
came
over
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
you
might
as
well
give
in
besides
your
leg
is
not
strong
enough
to
do
without
one
yet
still
grumbling
he
let
the
boys
help
him
into
the
wheel
chair
but
they
noticed
his
sigh
of
relief
when
he
was
settled
and
the
weight
was
taken
off
his
feet
his
body
trembled
with
weakness
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
control
himself
the
chair
their
books
and
cases
were
soon
loaded
into
the
copter
then
jon
directed
colonial
board
building
please
the
little
ship
rose
swiftly
on
her
whirling
vanes
then
streaked
through
the
clear
air
toward
the
center
of
the
great
city
of
centropolis
while
the
four
watched
the
familiar
sights
of
home
with
eager
happy
eyes
look
at
the
trees
and
flowers
jak
called
excitedly
pointing
at
the
riot
of
color
below
they
getting
green
and
in
full
bloom
late
spring
here
yet
it
was
fall
back
on
three
different
suns
different
seasons
on
the
various
planets
there
was
amusement
in
his
father
voice
sure
you
ought
to
know
that
jon
said
condescendingly
i
do
know
it
you
fathead
i
was
just
now
boys
their
mother
interposed
and
the
two
grinned
covertly
at
each
other
poor
mother
never
seemed
to
realize
there
was
no
real
animosity
behind
their
bickerings
it
took
only
a
few
minutes
for
the
swift
to
ferry
them
from
the
spaceport
to
the
roof
of
the
huge
colonial
building
tad
carver
paid
the
fare
the
boys
again
filled
their
arms
with
their
books
and
cases
and
mrs
carver
pushed
the
wheel
chair
to
the
elevator
they
descended
to
the
board
headquarters
floor
in
the
anteroom
their
father
propelled
his
chair
to
the
desk
i
tad
carver
owner
of
the
just
back
from
a
trip
we
wish
to
present
a
claim
as
prime
discoverers
of
a
new
planetary
system
oh
splendid
the
stately
brunette
eyes
lighted
is
it
a
good
one
she
asked
as
she
reached
into
one
of
the
drawers
of
her
desk
for
a
sheet
of
forms
mr
carver
smiled
five
planets
and
seven
moons
two
of
the
planets
are
very
earthlike
and
there
are
lots
of
metal
wood
and
many
other
things
a
distant
look
came
into
the
girl
eyes
i
never
been
out
in
space
it
must
be
wonderful
she
straightened
with
determination
please
answer
these
preliminary
questions
then
i
get
your
appointment
with
the
board
rapidly
she
put
the
questions
as
listed
on
her
forms
and
filled
in
the
vacant
places
as
he
answered
her
finished
she
rose
said
just
a
moment
please
and
went
in
through
a
side
door
with
the
papers
in
her
hand
mr
carver
wheeled
himself
back
to
his
family
who
were
sitting
stiffly
in
chairs
against
the
further
wall
are
they
going
to
allow
our
claim
jon
asked
nervously
the
others
leaned
forward
to
hear
the
answer
take
it
easy
mr
carver
eyes
showed
amusement
the
girl
has
merely
gone
in
to
make
an
appointment
for
us
this
takes
time
you
know
we
probably
wo
have
the
answer
for
several
days
oh
it
was
a
trio
of
disappointment
and
they
sat
back
to
wait
glumly
impatiently
but
only
a
few
minutes
later
they
straightened
expectantly
as
they
saw
the
receptionist
coming
back
she
crossed
over
to
them
the
board
is
at
liberty
to
hear
your
preliminary
claim
now
she
told
them
please
follow
me
she
led
them
through
the
same
side
door
and
into
a
large
room
beyond
the
four
looked
eagerly
about
them
seeing
a
office
across
the
room
was
a
large
heavy
behind
which
were
seated
five
men
and
tad
carver
and
their
two
sons
the
girl
introduced
them
before
leaving
please
take
those
chairs
from
his
seat
at
the
center
of
the
table
the
chairman
indicated
comfortable
chairs
on
the
side
of
the
table
opposite
him
jon
pushed
one
aside
while
jak
propelled
the
wheel
chair
into
the
vacant
space
then
the
other
three
carvers
seated
themselves
in
adjoining
seats
i
am
robert
wilson
chairman
of
the
board
the
other
members
are
phil
silverman
james
dougherty
will
irwin
and
sam
reardon
he
indicated
in
turn
the
other
men
at
the
table
i
see
you
claim
to
be
the
prime
discoverers
of
a
new
solar
system
that
wonderful
we
expanding
so
rapidly
what
with
the
increasing
birth
rate
on
terra
and
the
other
colonized
planets
that
we
already
and
always
need
more
room
tell
us
more
about
your
find
it
a
system
with
a
sun
much
like
sol
only
about
a
quarter
larger
the
coordinates
are
right
ascension
declination
minus
distance
about
light
years
swiftly
mr
carver
gave
the
pertinent
facts
about
the
habitability
of
planets
two
and
three
and
presented
their
books
of
data
and
their
cases
of
photographs
how
come
we
have
received
your
signals
or
did
you
place
any
irwin
asked
we
did
place
them
sir
but
we
noticed
several
days
ago
coming
in
that
we
could
not
hear
them
with
our
own
receivers
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
distance
is
too
great
for
the
strength
of
the
senders
that
possible
silverman
spoke
up
your
claim
is
farther
away
than
any
yet
presented
to
us
i
happen
to
know
that
the
furnished
by
our
board
technicians
ordinarily
have
a
theoretical
range
of
not
quite
fifty
mr
carver
then
settled
back
and
spoke
with
a
level
voice
while
his
eyes
swept
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
five
men
i
want
to
report
honestly
on
this
case
sirs
just
before
we
left
we
started
back
along
a
course
that
would
take
us
fairly
close
to
all
our
planets
and
the
sun
to
make
sure
our
senders
were
functioning
correctly
we
started
from
two
where
we
had
just
completed
our
city
site
went
past
one
and
around
the
sun
planning
to
make
a
big
swing
to
the
other
planets
and
so
back
home
the
senders
of
one
two
and
the
sun
were
working
all
right
but
as
we
neared
three
we
heard
instead
of
our
own
signals
stating
that
the
system
had
been
charted
and
claimed
by
michael
bogin
and
his
slik
bogin
several
of
the
board
members
exclaimed
in
concert
and
chairman
wilson
added
grimly
so
he
at
work
again
mr
carver
waited
until
they
were
silent
then
continued
we
think
he
either
destroyed
our
senders
or
substituted
his
own
tapes
in
ours
however
we
put
our
into
an
orbit
so
close
to
the
surface
we
doubt
if
he
be
able
to
do
anything
about
it
it
only
about
ten
million
miles
ten
million
reardon
almost
yelled
the
question
and
the
others
sat
upright
in
excited
astonishment
doubt
showing
in
their
faces
how
could
you
do
that
i
figured
a
van
sicklenberg
sir
to
give
our
sender
a
circular
orbit
apexing
at
ten
million
miles
jon
carver
explained
simply
we
used
the
in
our
lock
to
throw
the
sender
out
when
at
minimum
distance
you
there
was
a
concerted
expression
of
disbelief
and
reardon
said
witheringly
why
you
not
a
listed
astrogator
how
could
you
compute
a
a
what
was
it
you
called
it
a
van
sicklenberg
orbit
sir
i
never
heard
of
a
van
sicklenberg
what
is
it
what
sort
of
nonsense
are
you
talking
jon
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
but
his
mother
forestalled
him
she
rose
determinedly
my
jon
is
a
boy
gentlemen
but
he
has
also
become
an
expert
pilot
and
an
excellent
astrogator
if
i
do
say
so
myself
he
is
also
an
inventor
and
will
shortly
apply
for
patents
on
a
new
automatic
piloting
system
which
i
do
pretend
to
understand
anything
about
but
which
i
do
know
from
watching
its
use
is
far
in
advance
of
anything
you
now
have
you
can
be
sure
he
knows
how
to
do
such
a
simple
thing
as
plot
an
orbit
she
sat
down
eyes
defiant
her
mouth
in
a
straight
line
the
men
faces
showed
astonishment
at
her
words
as
much
as
at
her
outburst
i
had
been
knocked
unconscious
and
my
leg
was
broken
mr
carver
took
up
the
explanation
so
i
was
out
of
action
for
a
long
time
i
not
fully
recovered
yet
which
is
the
reason
for
the
discourtesy
of
this
wheel
chair
the
two
boys
had
to
take
over
all
the
work
of
mapping
the
new
system
but
i
have
examined
their
books
and
pictures
and
feel
sure
you
will
find
everything
in
order
and
complete
and
that
it
will
prove
our
rights
as
prime
discoverers
no
matter
what
bogin
may
have
to
say
when
he
gets
here
he
is
following
us
but
we
managed
to
beat
him
in
the
chairman
frowned
in
thought
then
whispered
for
some
moments
to
the
other
men
on
either
side
of
him
the
four
carvers
sat
nervously
awaiting
the
decision
of
the
final
arbiters
finally
chairman
wilson
addressed
them
directly
you
can
well
understand
that
we
will
have
to
make
a
rather
more
thorough
examination
than
usual
in
this
case
mr
carver
and
that
we
will
have
to
wait
a
few
days
to
see
whether
or
not
michael
bogin
is
going
to
make
a
knowing
you
got
here
first
he
may
decide
not
to
do
so
where
are
you
located
so
we
can
get
in
touch
with
you
later
we
came
directly
from
our
ship
sir
so
do
not
have
an
address
as
yet
however
as
soon
as
we
have
found
a
place
i
call
your
secretary
and
leave
our
address
and
visiphone
number
you
do
that
please
then
as
the
carvers
rose
to
depart
chairman
wilson
halted
them
his
voice
kindly
yet
grim
this
is
a
peculiar
case
carver
as
you
can
well
understand
we
know
the
reputation
of
bogin
but
we
also
know
he
has
never
been
found
guilty
of
any
of
the
things
rumor
claims
he
has
done
we
board
members
try
always
to
be
fair
and
honest
in
these
matters
and
you
can
feel
certain
and
confident
you
and
your
claims
will
be
given
careful
consideration
we
will
get
in
touch
with
you
in
a
few
days
thank
you
gentlemen
i
content
to
rest
my
claim
in
your
hands
the
four
bowed
then
left
the
office
and
the
building
what
do
you
think
father
jak
asked
anxiously
as
they
were
riding
a
whose
driver
had
been
instructed
to
find
them
a
good
apartment
hotel
i
do
know
mr
carver
added
a
weary
smile
it
all
in
the
future
and
i
not
a
seer
however
i
sure
we
get
an
honest
and
unbiased
hearing
and
decision
and
i
equally
positive
we
have
the
better
claim
so
let
forget
it
until
we
notified
to
appear
and
enjoy
our
return
to
terra
right
boys
their
mother
agreed
we
done
our
best
and
thanks
to
you
boys
it
a
very
fine
best
now
we
must
wait
but
not
worry
their
cabby
found
them
a
nice
place
where
there
was
a
vacancy
and
soon
the
four
were
unpacking
their
gear
and
getting
settled
in
their
new
home
mr
carver
visiphoned
at
once
to
give
the
new
address
and
phone
number
to
the
board
receptionist
then
the
carvers
settled
down
to
wait
with
as
much
patience
as
they
could
muster
for
the
call
jak
insisted
on
having
a
good
doctor
called
at
once
the
latter
made
a
thorough
examination
he
had
mr
carver
taken
to
an
laboratory
where
it
was
determined
that
the
broken
leg
had
been
perfectly
set
and
was
now
practically
healed
although
it
would
be
some
time
before
the
strength
returned
to
it
he
also
prescribed
a
course
of
medications
to
bring
back
the
invalid
full
health
and
vigor
the
call
came
from
the
board
three
days
later
in
the
middle
of
a
morning
when
fortunately
the
four
carvers
were
all
in
the
apartment
they
hurried
down
to
the
street
where
they
flagged
a
and
were
driven
swiftly
to
the
colonial
building
the
same
brunette
girl
ushered
them
at
once
into
the
board
room
inside
they
found
the
complete
board
in
session
and
in
chairs
opposite
them
sat
slik
bogin
and
his
chief
lieutenant
who
glared
at
the
carvers
sullenly
as
they
entered
hardly
were
the
four
seated
when
bogin
sprang
to
his
feet
what
the
big
idea
carver
he
almost
yelled
trying
to
claim
our
discovery
you
got
a
crust
trying
something
sit
down
bogin
and
keep
quiet
chairman
wilson
spoke
in
a
low
but
commanding
voice
we
here
to
judge
the
facts
as
presented
not
to
indulge
in
charges
countercharges
and
vituperation
now
the
board
has
examined
minutely
both
sets
of
claims
both
parties
have
presented
all
the
data
required
by
us
and
these
have
been
studied
by
each
of
us
individually
dougherty
he
turned
to
one
of
the
board
members
please
review
the
data
sheets
for
us
a
tall
man
rose
and
arranged
the
two
sets
of
sheets
before
him
according
to
the
carver
claim
as
presented
here
he
gestured
toward
one
set
of
books
they
arrived
at
the
system
and
made
their
first
landing
on
planet
two
on
january
of
this
year
the
bogin
claim
is
that
they
first
discovered
the
system
and
landed
on
planet
three
on
january
tenth
also
of
the
year
both
parties
claim
they
set
out
the
required
although
neither
have
been
heard
by
our
listening
posts
here
however
we
know
that
signals
from
these
senders
can
not
ordinarily
be
read
at
distances
in
excess
of
fifty
and
the
system
under
consideration
is
said
to
be
over
sixty
we
have
asked
the
communications
department
to
check
with
ships
and
planets
nearer
the
system
in
question
to
learn
whether
or
not
any
signals
from
it
have
been
received
he
paused
a
moment
and
looked
at
his
fellow
members
first
then
at
the
expectant
six
across
the
table
i
said
that
both
parties
have
presented
complete
data
however
it
seems
to
us
after
careful
scrutiny
that
one
set
of
data
was
obtained
from
the
air
and
from
the
surface
of
three
of
the
five
planets
and
from
a
height
of
less
than
twenty
miles
above
the
seven
moons
and
less
than
five
from
the
other
two
planets
as
our
regulations
specify
the
other
books
clearly
show
that
the
observations
were
all
taken
from
above
the
surface
there
was
relief
on
the
faces
of
the
four
carvers
nervous
side
glances
between
bogin
and
his
henchman
none
of
which
escaped
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
five
board
members
watching
closely
the
reactions
of
the
two
opposing
parties
we
have
here
the
two
sets
of
photographs
taken
from
a
height
of
five
miles
as
specified
by
our
rulings
of
the
townsite
that
we
require
to
be
laid
out
he
held
one
set
out
to
each
party
across
the
table
please
examine
them
and
let
us
know
if
you
see
any
differences
there
was
silence
for
several
long
anxious
moments
then
after
the
two
groups
had
studied
the
photographs
handed
them
jon
carver
suddenly
let
out
a
gasp
and
looked
up
eagerly
may
i
speak
sirs
you
may
this
is
not
the
picture
we
took
indicating
one
if
you
will
compare
the
two
you
will
find
that
this
one
was
taken
before
the
work
was
fully
completed
see
there
is
a
gap
here
along
the
east
side
where
not
all
the
stakes
are
in
oh
his
mother
looked
up
quickly
and
took
up
the
story
then
i
was
right
that
time
i
did
hear
a
ship
you
see
sirs
she
addressed
the
board
members
more
directly
the
boys
ran
out
of
stakes
and
had
to
go
to
the
forest
there
some
miles
to
the
northwest
of
the
ship
to
cut
more
look
you
can
see
just
the
edge
of
our
ship
right
here
on
the
margin
while
they
were
gone
i
thought
i
heard
a
ship
passing
over
ours
but
when
i
got
to
the
control
room
and
could
look
through
a
plate
either
it
had
gone
out
of
sight
or
i
was
mistaken
the
boys
said
when
asked
after
they
got
back
that
they
had
neither
heard
nor
seen
it
they
were
in
the
woods
at
the
time
but
i
believe
now
that
i
did
hear
a
ship
that
it
was
bogin
and
that
he
took
this
picture
at
that
time
it
took
the
boys
nearly
a
day
and
a
half
longer
to
complete
their
work
and
not
until
after
that
was
our
picture
taken
the
board
chairman
smiled
at
her
then
turned
a
severe
face
toward
bogin
and
his
lieutenant
that
is
exactly
what
the
pictures
show
that
one
is
complete
and
the
other
is
not
what
have
you
to
say
about
that
the
man
face
was
black
with
fury
i
say
they
liars
he
shouted
this
one
here
shaking
the
photograph
he
held
is
our
picture
that
one
is
theirs
mr
carver
started
to
rise
but
jak
was
before
him
and
it
was
the
latter
whose
voice
cut
through
the
din
oh
no
and
i
can
prove
which
is
our
picture
if
you
will
examine
all
the
rest
i
did
all
the
developing
and
printing
and
you
find
a
small
down
in
the
lower
corner
of
all
our
pictures
i
marked
all
our
negatives
that
way
as
you
can
determine
if
you
send
someone
to
our
ship
to
get
the
negatives
from
the
darkroom
the
board
members
huddled
over
the
sheaves
of
pictures
for
a
moment
then
turned
severely
toward
bogin
the
young
man
is
correct
all
the
carver
pictures
are
so
marked
and
so
is
this
one
of
the
completed
townsite
jon
carver
broke
in
ask
them
to
describe
the
animal
life
they
found
on
planet
three
he
suggested
well
the
chairman
looked
levelly
at
bogin
why
why
the
latter
was
quite
taken
aback
by
this
sudden
challenge
why
there
are
several
species
and
and
they
were
more
or
less
like
ours
here
although
not
exactly
like
them
of
course
ha
that
proves
he
was
never
on
the
ground
there
jon
cried
out
in
triumph
we
found
and
so
will
anyone
else
you
care
to
send
there
that
while
planet
three
has
a
lot
of
vegetation
and
is
perfectly
habitable
though
cold
there
is
absolutely
no
protoplasmic
life
to
be
found
there
at
least
he
added
honestly
on
any
of
the
surface
we
covered
and
our
ship
log
will
show
as
you
can
see
there
that
we
flew
at
less
than
five
miles
up
for
eight
complete
but
spiral
revolutions
about
the
planet
and
were
on
the
ground
in
several
places
which
we
explored
and
photographed
thoroughly
the
young
man
is
right
silverman
spoke
up
i
noticed
that
fact
mentioned
in
their
records
and
intended
asking
more
about
it
because
this
is
the
first
planet
of
which
i
heard
that
is
otherwise
completely
habitable
by
mankind
where
such
a
condition
has
obtained
where
there
is
voluminous
floral
life
but
no
protoplasmic
life
of
any
kind
being
something
of
a
botanist
that
fact
struck
me
at
once
bogin
rose
sneering
but
also
feeling
safe
in
this
part
of
his
claim
bah
they
just
did
happen
to
sit
down
in
the
same
places
we
did
if
they
were
there
at
all
we
saw
lots
of
animal
life
there
and
you
took
pictures
of
such
life
mr
carver
asked
pointedly
why
no
it
is
required
there
was
a
discreet
rap
on
the
door
and
when
the
chairman
gave
permission
the
receptionist
entered
and
handed
him
a
sheet
of
paper
he
examined
it
quickly
then
passed
it
to
his
fellow
members
the
five
conferred
together
in
quick
whispers
for
several
minutes
while
bogin
and
his
man
glared
in
sullen
anger
at
the
carvers
four
of
the
board
members
finally
resumed
their
seats
while
chairman
wilson
stood
at
his
place
he
pressed
a
buzzer
then
took
up
his
gavel
he
struck
three
loud
solemn
notes
with
it
it
is
the
considered
opinion
of
the
terran
colonial
board
here
assembled
in
official
meeting
he
intoned
that
tad
carver
has
proven
his
claim
as
prime
discoverer
of
the
solar
system
henceforth
to
be
known
as
and
this
decision
shall
be
so
entered
in
our
records
as
of
this
date
congratulations
he
added
smiling
as
he
turned
to
the
happy
four
who
were
attempting
the
almost
impossible
task
of
each
hugging
all
the
others
at
the
same
time
bogin
and
his
lieutenant
rose
wrathfully
and
started
to
leave
the
room
just
a
moment
bogin
chairman
wilson
said
authoritatively
you
are
under
arrest
for
an
illegal
attempt
to
defraud
by
false
testimony
bogin
eyes
blazing
suddenly
seemed
to
go
berserk
he
drew
a
blaster
from
an
underarm
holster
and
waved
it
about
as
he
and
his
man
backed
toward
the
door
you
ai
gon
na
arrest
nobody
we
leaving
here
and
we
cinder
the
first
one
of
you
that
moves
but
unseen
by
them
the
door
behind
had
opened
and
three
space
marines
guns
in
hand
had
entered
in
response
to
the
chairman
buzzed
call
drop
that
gun
mister
their
leader
said
sharply
his
own
muzzle
pushed
against
bogin
back
the
latter
face
livid
did
so
in
moments
the
two
pirates
were
handcuffed
the
sergeant
saluted
the
board
members
guards
will
be
sent
to
the
spaceport
at
once
to
arrest
the
other
members
of
the
bogin
crew
sir
pending
examination
and
trial
thank
you
sergeant
we
will
prefer
charges
at
once
as
the
marines
started
leading
the
two
away
bogin
pulled
back
suddenly
and
faced
mr
carver
one
thing
i
like
to
know
we
were
catching
up
with
you
fast
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
pulled
away
from
us
as
though
we
was
standing
still
yet
we
were
all
in
slings
and
doing
three
and
a
half
g
you
do
it
mr
carver
smiled
lazily
we
submitting
a
full
report
to
space
pilot
you
can
read
it
there
if
they
let
you
read
where
you
going
he
turned
back
to
the
board
members
and
again
expressed
the
thanks
of
himself
and
his
family
chairman
wilson
held
out
a
sheet
of
paper
you
may
be
interested
in
this
report
it
came
from
the
communications
center
on
petrarch
three
and
was
the
deciding
factor
in
your
case
the
four
clustered
close
to
read
carver
signals
heard
first
then
ceased
one
by
one
and
the
bogin
signals
began
although
one
carver
signal
the
solar
one
is
still
heard
mr
carver
turned
to
the
board
members
and
said
like
most
crooks
bogin
was
yellow
he
did
have
nerve
enough
to
run
in
as
close
to
the
sun
as
these
youngsters
of
mine
did
and
so
could
change
their
signal
there
the
boys
are
great
planet
mappers
both
of
them
edward
everett
evans
was
born
in
coldwater
michigan
the
youngest
of
the
four
children
of
john
and
nellie
evans
enlisting
in
the
navy
after
leaving
high
school
he
served
as
a
musician
before
and
during
the
first
world
war
he
played
in
concert
and
dance
bands
for
several
years
after
leaving
the
service
and
still
finds
enjoyment
in
listening
to
good
music
although
he
no
longer
performs
on
any
instrument
he
learned
to
read
even
before
he
entered
kindergarten
and
has
always
had
a
fondness
for
the
strange
and
in
stories
when
science
fiction
and
fantasy
first
gained
their
own
magazines
he
became
a
regular
reader
of
them
and
still
is
evans
began
attending
conventions
of
the
fans
of
science
fiction
with
the
first
chicon
or
chicago
convention
and
he
has
not
missed
one
since
he
finds
both
enjoyment
and
profit
from
meeting
the
people
who
are
also
interested
in
this
kind
of
literature
from
reading
to
writing
was
a
logical
step
although
not
an
easy
one
but
evans
has
made
the
step
successfully
in
addition
to
his
novels
he
has
over
forty
short
stories
to
his
credit
all
of
these
reflect
his
optimism
about
the
future
of
the
human
race
and
his
firm
belief
that
the
great
majority
of
people
are
swell
guys
he
confidently
expects
to
see
man
first
spaceship
make
a
successful
flight
within
his
lifetime
and
thinks
it
will
not
be
long
after
that
before
many
of
the
astonishing
happenings
and
inventions
of
his
stories
will
be
actualities
