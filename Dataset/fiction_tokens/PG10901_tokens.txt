of

was
in
the
eddy
mows
come
on
shouted
jot
here
she
goes
hip
hip
echoed
kent
but
of
course
old
tilly
took
it
calmly
he
planted
his
brown
hands
and
his
bare
brown
legs
wide
apart
and
surveyed
the
splendid
bursting
mows
with
honest
pride
yes
sir
that
the
finest
lot
o
hay
in
hexham
county
beat
it
if
you
can

he
said
approvingly
then
being
ready
he
caught
off
his
own
hat
and
cheered
too
hold
on
you
chaps
give
the
old
man
a
chance
to
holler
with
you
father
eddy
big
hearty
voice
cried
above
the
din
and
there
was
the
flaring
swinging
with
the
other
hats
hooray
for
the
best
hay
in
town
hooray
for
the
smartest
team
o
boys
hooray
for
hooray
hooray
they
were
all
of
them
out
of
breath
and
red
in
the
face
but
how
they
cheered
liberty
that
was
something
to
cheer
for
after
and
haying
hurrah
for
liberty
the
din
softened
gradually
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm
father
gathered
all
the
boys
in
a
laughing
heap
before
him
well
he
said
what
next
who
going
to
celebrate

done
with
you

a
fortnight

chores
and
send
you
small
chaps
about

your
holiday
and
i
do
know
but
it
as
good
a
time
as
any
to
settle
up
pay
day
as
good
one
day
as
another
he
drew
out
a
little
tight
roll
of
bills
and
sorted
out
three
notes
gravely
the
boys
eyes
began
to
shine
father
always
paid
them
after
haying
but
five
dollars
apiece
old
tilly
pursed
his
lips
and
whistled
softly
kent
nudged
jot
illustration
he
sorted
out
three
notes
gravely
there
you
are
you
need
mind
about
giving
receipts
father
eddy
said
but
his
gray
eyes
were
under
their
cliffs
of
gray
brows
he
was
exulting
quietly
in
the
delight
he
could
read
in
the
three
round
brown
faces
good
boys
yes
sir
all
of
them
was
their
beat
in
hexham
county

with
you
scatter
he
laughed
mother
and
i
are
going
to
mill
to
celebrate
when
you
decided
what
you
going
to
do
send
a
committee
o
three
to
let
us
know
mind
you
can
celebrate
any
way
you
want
to
that
sensible
the
boys
waited
till
the
tall
figure
had
gone
back
into
the
dim
barn
then
with
one
accord
the
din
began
again
for
father
father
father
it
died
away
began
again
then
trailed
out
to
a
faint
wail
as
the
boys
scuttled
off
round
the
barn
to
the
orchard
father
smiled
to
himself
unsteadily
good
boys
good
boys
good
boys
he
muttered
come
on
up
in
the
consultery
cried
kent
excitedly
yes
come
on
old
till
that
the
place
jot
echoed
the
consultery
was
a
platform
up
in
the
great
tree
when
there
was
time
it
could
be
reached
comfortably
by
a
short
ladder
but
in
times
of
hurry
it
was
the
custom
to
swing
up
to
it
by
a
bough
with
a
long
running
jump
as
a
starter
they
all
swung
up
oh
i
say
wo
there
be
times
cried
kent
five
apiece
is
fifteen
lumped
you
can
celebrate
like
everything
with
fifteen
dollars
sure
but
how
old
tilly
asked
in
his
gentle
moderate
way
we
want
any
old
common
celebration
you
better
believe
we
do
no
sir
we
want
to
do
something
new
camping
out
old
camping
no
good
go
on
jot
said
briefly
it
was
always
old
tilly
they
looked
to
for
suggestions
if
you
waited
long
enough
they
were
sure
to
come
well
that
the
trouble
i
ca
on
yet
you
do
give
a
chap
time
to
wink
what
we
want
is
to
settle
right
down
to
it
and
think
out
a
fine
way
to
celebrate
it
got
to
take
time
for
the
space
of
a
minute
it
was
still
in
the
consultery
save
for
the
soft
swish
of
the
leaves
overhead
and
roundabout
then
jot
broke
out
a
minute
was
jot
utmost
limit
of
silence
we
could
go
up
through
the
notch
and
back
you
know
he
reflected
that
no
end
of
fun
would
cost
us
all
more
a
fiver
for
the
round
trip
and
we
have
the
other
ten
to
to
buy
popcorn
and
mountain
views
with
finished
kent
in
scorn
well
if
you
want
to
dress
up
in
your
best
fixin
and
stew
all
day
in
a
railroad
train
i
do
rejoined
jot
hastily
i
was
thinking
of
old
till
tilly
other
name
was
nathan
but
it
had
grown
musty
with
disuse
he
was
the
oldest
of
the
eddy
trio
and
ballasted
the
other
two
father
eddy
said
old
tilly
was
fourteen
and
the
eddy
twins
jotham
and
kennet
were
twelve
all
three
were
lusty
fellows
who
could
work
or
celebrate
their
liberty
as
the
case
might
be
with
a
good
will
just
now
it
was
the
latter
they
wanted
to
do
in
some
untried
way
it
was
a
beautiful
up
in
the
consultery
the
birds
in
the
meshes
of
leaves
that
roofed
it
over
twittered
in
whispers
as
if
they
realized
that
a
momentous
question
was
under
consultation
down
below
and
demanded
quiet
jot
fretted
impatiently
under
his
breath
should
think
it
need
to
take
all
day
he
muttered
you
as
slow
as
as
old
tilly
laughed
kent
the
spell
of
silence
was
broken
and
the
birds
overhead
broke
into
jubilant
trills
as
if
they
were
laughing
too
i
guess
the
name
fits
all
right
this
time
old
tilly
said
ruefully
i
ca
seem
to
think
of
anything
at
all
my
head
clicks
the
mowing
machine
wheels
have
got
into
it
i
guess
wheels
in
mine
too
kent
drawled
lazily
wheels
jot
sprang
to
his
feet
in
excitement
in
his
haste
he
miscalculated
the
dimensions
of
the
consultery
there
was
a
wild
flutter
of
brown
hands
and
feet
and
then
the
chestnut
leaves
closed
calmly
over
the
opening
and
there
were
but
two
boys
in
the
consultery
one
of
those
parted
the
leaves
again
and
peered
down
hello
jot
no
answer
old
tilly
laugh
froze
on
his
face
jot
hello
he
cried
preparing
to
swing
himself
down
hello
yourself
came
up
calmly
oh
are
you
killed
but
i
say
you
need
either
o
you
sit
up
there
any
longer
gloomin
i
thought
of
the
way
we
celebrate
it
great
the
crisp
branches
creaked
as
the
others
swung
down
to
the
ground
in
haste
you
have
cried
kent
what
is
it
quick
old
tilly
said
old
tilly
in
a
hurry
wheels
announced
jot
deliberately
you

in
your
head
and
that
put
into
mine
yes
sir
we
celebrate
on
wheels
why
of
course
good
for
you
shouted
kent
but
old
tilly
weighed
things
first
in
his
mind
that
would
be
a
go
if
we
had
enough
to
round
but
you
twinnies
wouid
have
to
ride
double
or
spell
each
other
or
something

nobody
scornfully
cried
jot
no

that
all

me
his
bike
just
like
a
book
i
know
ben
besides
he
owes
me
a
dollar
and
call
it
square
there
old
tilly
nodded
approvingly
good
he
said
then
we
take
a
trip
off
somewhere
that
what
you
meant
sure
we
go
discovering
things
you
know
like
those
fellows
what
their
names
who
did
errands
for
people
and
had
wonderful
things
happen
to
them
while
doing
them
put
in
kent
enthusiastically

exclaimed
old
till
laughing
that

jotham

why
they
er
they

rode
round
on
splendid
horses
all
armed
er
and
armed
with
old
tilly
came
briskly
to
the
rescue
never
mind
the
errands
or
the
pie
laughed
he
we
be
knights
and

up
distressed
folks

start
morning
at
sunrise
for
morning
for
sunrise
for
jot
finished
kent
generously
forgetting
mockeries
the
plan
promised
gloriously
when
father
and
mother
came
home
from
the
mill
they
fell
in
with
it
heartily
and
mother
rolled
up
her
sleeves
at
once
to
make
cakes
to
fill
the
boys
bundle
racks
they
would
buy
other
things
as
they
went
along
that
would
be
part
of
the
fun
in
the
middle
of
the
night
jot
got
out
of
bed
softly
and
padded
his
way
across
to
the
bureau
to
feel
of
the
three
bills
they
had
left
together
under
the
pincushion
for
a
paper
weight
he
slid
his
fingers
under
carefully
what
he
lifted
the
cushion
then
he
struck
a
match
two
matches
three
in
agitated
succession
the
money
was
gone
chapter
ii
jot
gasped
with
horror
the
last
match
went
out
and
left
him
standing
there
in
the
dark
after
one
instant
hesitation
he
made
a
bound
for
the
bed
kent

whispered

the
limp

strengthened
as

and
rose
to
a
sitting
position

he
cried

wish

jot
eddy
old
tilly
was
slumbering
peacefully
oblivious
to
thieves
and
bills
alike
it
took
a
long
time
to
wake
him
and
longer
yet
to
make
him
understand
the
dire
thing
that

all

and

money
if
you
are
old
tilly
then
something
funny
happened
anyway
it
seemed
funny
to
old
tilly
he
buried
his
face
in
the
pillow
and
choked
with
laughter
it
gone
to
his
head
whispered
jot
in
alarm
no
to
his
giggled
old
tilly
purple
in
the
face

laugh

wo
you

sir
but
we
wait
till

get
out
o
bed
and
that
this
very
minute
jot
exclaimed
wrathfully
he
was
dancing
up
and
down
with
impatience
old
tilly
slowly
brought
a
lean
shapely
leg
into
view
from
beneath
the
sheet
to
the
boys
amazement
it
was
covered
with
a
long
black
stocking
old
tilly
like
the
other
boys
had
been
barefooted
all
day
thought
i
might
as
well
get
a
good
start
in
dressing
he
chuckled
nothing
like
being
read
oh
come
off
well
i
wish
it
would
there
something
in
the
toe
that
hurts
ow
he
drew
off
the
stocking
and
gravely
examined
the
snug
little
wad
in
the
toe
the
money
cried
kent
yes
sir
the
money
jot
echoed
in
astonishment
why
so
it
is
old
tilly
said
in
evident
surprise
then
the
thieves
did
get
away
with
it
after
all
i
call
that
a
lucky
stroke
my
getting
partly
dressed
overnight
no
hold
on
you
little
chaps
get
uppy
i
explain
honest
i
will
you
see
i
got
up
after
a
while
and
put
the
money
there
for
i
like
to
see
the
thief
that
would
look
there
for
it
he
get
a
good
kick
if
he
did
it
was
half
an
hour
later
when
the
trio
settled
back
into
sleep
again
in
the
east
already
there
were
dim
outriders
of
day
trailing
across
the
darkness
without
further
incident
the
three
got
under
way
next
day
in
a
glare
of
july
sunshine
they
rode
away
in
search
of
adventures
while
father
and
mother
eddy
in
the
kitchen
doorway
looked
after
them
a
little
wistfully
bless
their
hearts
mother
murmured
good
boys
good
boys
said
father
coughing
to
cover
the
break
in
his
voice
i
say
this
is
great
called
jot
who
led
the
van
of
course
this
is
the
way
to
do
it
illustration
i
say
this
is
great
called
jot
yes
sir
kent
cried
in
high
feather
it
feels
as
if
you
were
old
knights
you
know
is
it
jolly
not
to
know
what
going
to
happen
next
old
tilly
wheel
slid
up
abreast
of
kent
and
proceeded
sociably
esau
whalley
farm
next
and
then
old
uncle
rod
next
old
tilly
said
calmly
i
guess
we
better
wait
till
we
get
out
o
this
neck
o
woods
before
we
settle
down
to
making
believe
but
three
wheels
driven
by
three
pairs
of
sturdy
legs
get
over
miles
swiftly
and
by
ten
the
boys
had
turned
down
an
unfamiliar
road
and
were
on
the
way
to
things
that
happened
before
noon
knightly
deeds
were
at
their
hand
jot
himself
discovered
the
first
one
he
vaulted
from
his
bicycle
suddenly
as
they
were
bowling
past
a
little
gray
house
set
in
weeds
and
the
others
looking
back
saw
him
carrying
a
dripping
pail
of
water
along
the
path
to
the
kitchen
doorsteps
the
pail
was
out
there
on
the
well
curb
asking
to
be
filled
he
explained
brusquely
as
he
caught
up
with
them
and
the
old
woman
pumping
into
it
did
look
as
if
lugging
water
agreed
with
her
besides
i
wanted
a
drink
you
did
get
one
retorted
kent
wisely
jot
cast
a
sidewise
glance
upon
him
i
said
i
wanted
one
did
i
anybody
can
want
a
drink
and
take
your
remedy
dose
lug
one
pail
o
water
for
an
old
woman
if
not
successful
repeat
in
ten
min
jot
made
a
rapid
spurt
and
left
his
teaser
behind
when
old
tilly
had
come
abreast
of
him
again
he
reached
out
a
brotherly
hand
and
bestowed
a
hearty
pat
on
his
arm
good
boy
he
said
and
unconsciously
his
voice
was
like
father
miles
back
in
the
kitchen
doorway
it
was
the
way
father
would
have
said
it
that
the
way
to
do
we
pick
up
to
do
for
folks
the
use
of
being
knights
and
old
tilly
turn
came
next
in
the
way
of
driving
the
cows
out
of
somebody
corn
patch
and
propping
up
the
broken
fence
if
it
took
but
a
few
minutes
what
of
that
it
saved
a
bent
old
man
rheumatic
leg
and
the
gay
whistle
that
went
with
it
drifted
into
an
open
window
and
pleased
a
little
fretful
child
my
turn
next
shouted
kent
gliding
away
from
them
out
of
sight
over
the
brow
of
a
hill
good
luck
to
you
called
jot
we
going
into
camp
to
take
a
bite
no
use
being
in
such
a
rush
when
you
come
my
way
drop
in
floated
back
faintly
they
tilted
their
wheels
against
trees
and
threw
themselves
down
in
the
shade
to
rest
jot
was
ravenous
with
hunger
cakes
are
all
right
to
begin
on
he
said
regarding
mother
bountiful
store
with
approval
but
when
i
strike
the
next
store
you
see
the
crackers
and
cheese
fly
i
do
mind
taking
a
hand
in
the
scrimmage
myself
laughed
old
tilly
munching
a
fat
cake
i
say
was
kent
foolish
to
go
scooting
off
like
that
might
as
well
have
begun
easy
i
move
we
ride
nights
and
mornings
mostly
and
loaf
noons
there
a
moon
his
voice
trailed
lazily
into
song
it
was
pleasant
lounging
in
the
shade
and
remembering
the
hay
was
all
in
and
adventures
ahead
an
hour
or
so
later
they
moved
on
at
a
leisurely
pace
looking
for
kent
the
general
direction
had
been
agreed
upon
so
they
experienced
no
anxiety
it
added
to
the
fun
to
hunt
for
him
where
in
the
world
did
he
go
to
queried
old
tilly
laughing
he
disappeared
like
a
streak
of
lightning
i
see
him
there
under
that
tree
cried
jot
waving
a
salute
lying
down
and
enjoying
life
but
it
was
a
tired
old
man
under
the
tree
and
from
his
forlorn
face
he
did
not
seem
to
be
enjoying
life
he
was
very
old
very
shabby
very
tired
his
unkempt
figure
had
collapsed
feebly
by
the
way
apparently
what
astonished
the
boys
was
the
wheel
that
lay
on
its
side
near
him
he
did
not
look
like
a
wheelman
hold
on
old
till
i
say
called
jot
in
sudden
excitement
forging
ahead
to
his
side
i
say
that
looks
like
our
wheel
mine
and
kent
i
guess
i
know
our
wheel
jot
was
riding
the
borrowed
machine

had
the
one
they
owned
jointly
you

sonny

that
way
rejoined
old
tilly

in
his
turn

pounce
on
it
and

how

given
it

the
old
duffer
for
a
birthday

hundredth
anniversary
he
scoffed
that

be
taking
his
turn
at
doing
let
go
right
on
and
not
disturb
the
poor
old
man
let
have
sense
remarked
old
tilly
briefly
we
forge
on
ahead
and
hunt
kent
up
before
we
arrest
tramps
for
when
he
says
he
been
robbed
it
be
time
to
holler
thief
yes
come

jot
called
back
as
he
shot
ahead
i
have
a
doubt
but
we
find
kentie
got
his
bike
tucked
away
all
safe
in
the
toe
of
his
stocking
they
came
almost
instantly
into
the
outskirts
of
a
snug
little
settlement
the
road
was
flanked
on
both
sides
by
neat
white
houses
trig
little
children
scurried
out
of
their
way
cheering
shrilly
somewhere
there
was
music

it
appears
in
the
original
book
hark
jot
cried
hark
yourself
that
a
good
old
tilly
said
and
he
hummed
the
familiar
tune
and
both
wheels
sped
on
to
the
time
of
it
as
it
seemed
the
music
grew
louder
look
up
in
that
dooryard
will
you
jot

look
at
the
chap
that
grinding
it

an
exclamation

astonishment
chapter
iii
up
in
one
of
the
shady
side
yards
stood
kent
turning
the
crank
of
a
he
was
facing
the
highway
where
the
other
two
boys
were
but
not
a
trace
of
recognition
was
in
his
face
ranged
in
a
semicircle
before
him
was
a
line
of
little
children
shuffling
their
toes
to
the
gay
tune
it
kent
gasped
jot
or
his
ghost
pretty
lively
one
where
in
the
world
did
he
get
that
and
what
he
done
with
his
bike
why
oh
old
tilly
added
two
and
two
and
in
the
light
of
a
sudden
inspiration
they
made
four
yes
of
course
that
was
it
but
he
would
wait
and
let
jot
guess
it
out
for
himself
jot
had
other
business
in
hand
just
then
say
come
on
up
there
with
the
youngsters
old
till
he
whispered
excitedly
come
on
quick
we
make
him
smile
he
ca
keep
his
face
with
us
tagging
on
with
the
children
they
left
their
wheels
beside
the
road
and
stalked
solemnly
up
the
path
the
children
were
too
intent
on
the
music
to
notice
them
and
the
figure
at
the
crank
did
not
change
its
stiff
military
attitude
the
tune
lurched
and
swayed
on
suddenly
with
a
sharp
click
the
music
swept
into
something
majestic
and
martial
with
the
tread
of
soldiers
feet
and
the
boom
of
drums
in
it
the
faces
of
the
little
children
grew
solemn
and
unconsciously
their
little
shoulders
straightened
and
they
stood
at
attention
they
were
all
little
patriots
at
heart
and
they
longed
to
step
into
file
and
tramp
away
to
that
splendid
music
again
the
tune
changed
sharply
and
still
again
then
the
slung
his
instrument
with
an
experienced
twist
and
twirl
across
his
shoulders
and
took
off
his
cap
look
will
you

going
to
pass
it
round
giggled
jot
under
his
breath
he
pass
it
to
us

your

commanded
old
till
sharply
the
handed
round
his
cap
up
and
down
the
crooked
line
of
his
audience
the
two
sober
boys
at
one
end
dropped
in
a
number
of
pennies
one
at
a
time
deliberately
bless
ye
murmured
the
gratefully
jot
brown
face
tweaked
with
the
agony
of
keeping
straight
but
old
tilly
was
equal
to
the
occasion
he
assumed
a
benevolent
pitying
expression
hold
on
a
minute
he
called
here
a
nickel
for
your
poor
wife
and
children
how
many
you
got
five
sir
your
honor
the
musician
murmured
thickly
starving
sure
all
but
a
couple
of
the
little
uns
they
up
dressed
thank
ye
bless
ye
jot
made
a
strange
choking
sound
in
his
throat

the
young
gent
took
ill
inquired
the
solicitously
no
oh
no
only
a
slight
attack
of
strangulating
he
liable
to
attacks
it
was
the
music
too
much
for
him
old
tilly
gravely
explained
but
his
lips
quivered
and
struggled
to
smile
the
whole
little
procession
trailed
slowly
down
the
lane
to
the
street
at
the
next
house
and
at
all
the
others
in
succession
it
turned
in
and
arranged
itself
in
line
again
prepared
to
listen
with
ears
and
dancing
toes
jot
and
old
tilly
followed
on
in
the
rear
they
found
it
hard
work
to
find
pennies
enough
to
drop
into
the
cap
at
every
round
toward
the
end
they
economized
narrowly
the
small
settlement
came
to
an
abrupt
ending
just
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
houses
gave
out
and
the
musician
and
his
audience
swung
about
and
retraced
their
steps
the
children
dropped
off
a
few
at
a
time
until
there
were
left
only
the
three
boys
who
went
on
soberly
together
oh
say
broke
out
jot
at
last

not
for
the
likes

me
to
your
honor
the
murmured
humbly
and

gave
him
a
violent
nudge

knock
off

cried
i

and
for
the
sake
o
goodness

where

my
wheel
quoted
kent
from
the
fourth
reader
he
was
shaking
with
suppressed
laughter
that
turned
into
astonishment
at
old
tilly
calm
rejoinder
if
it
did
take
old
till
to
ferret
things
out
it
is
liable
to
turn
while
that
old
tramp
has
it
tilly
said
calmly
he
is
built
for
a
rider
what
kind
of
a
trade
did
you
make
anyway
going
halves
no
going
wholes
kent
answered
briefly
and
would
say
no
more
they
went
on
down
the
sandy
road
when
they
got
back
to
the
forlorn
old
figure
under
the
tree
it
was
slowly
rising
up
and
regarding
them
out
of
tired
eyes
the
wheel
still
leaned
comfortably
in
its
place
close
by
me
bring
money

tunes

said
very
slowly
and
distinctly
pausing
between
every
word
he
a
foreigner

know
he
explained
over
his
shoulder
to
the
boys
he
no
understand
you
have
to
talk
pigeon
english
to
him
see
how
he
catches
on
to
what
i
said
the
old
face
had
grown
less
dull
and
weary
a
slow
light
seemed
to
illumine
it
as
the
little
stream
of
pennies
dripped
into
the
tremulous
wrinkled
old
hand
it
suddenly
flashed
into
a
smile
then
a
stream
of
strange
words
issued
from
the
old
man
lips
they
tripped
over
each
other
and
made
weird
indistinguishable
combinations
of
sound
but
the
boys
translated
them
by
the
light
of
that
smile
how
pleased
the
old
fellow
was
how
he
fingered
over
the
pennies
exultantly
tell
the
whole
story
old
man
old
tilly
said
quietly
as
they
mounted
their
wheels
and
glided
off

a
novel

without
any
fooling

that
old
chap
when
i
came
on
him
he
was
all
used

there
was
a
creek
back
a
ways
and
the
water
kind
of
pulled
him
up
he
could
talk
english
but
he
offered
me
a
black
piece
for
pay
he
turned
his
pocket
out
to
find
it
that
set
me
to
thinking
i
make
him
a
little
richer
of
course

on
hurried
jot

old
tilly
cried
softly
i
say
that
was
splendid
kentie
i
like
that
kent
flushed
uneasily
old
tilly
face
looked
like
father
when
he
said
his
rare
hearty
words
of
commendation
well
the
likes
it
too
kent
laughed
now
he
can
have
something
to
eat
poor
old
fellow
he
could
have
gone
through
all
those
dooryards
to
save
his
life
he
was
sunstruck
i
told
a
motherly
old
lady
about
him
at
one
of
the
houses
and
she
going
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
him
and
give
him
a
snack
of
meat
and
bread
they
went
on
for
half
a
mile
quite
silently
then
without
warning
jot
suddenly
began
to
laugh
he
tumbled
off
his
bicycle
and
collapsed
in
a
feeble
heap
do
anybody
me
he
cried
it
dangerous
i
having
one
my
the
others
joined
in
and
for
a
little
the
woods
rang
with
boyish
mirth
it
was
rich
stammered
jot
passing
the
hat
round
capped
it
it
was
great
laughed
old
tilly

actor
kentie
me
what
are

i
ca
grind
a
and
pass
round
the
hat
like
that
i
could
jot
cried
suddenly
sobering
down
and
going
through
the
motions
of
turning
a
crank
with
airy
ease
it
too
easy
for
me
the
fun
lasted
until
night
it
was
saturday
and
they
rode
until
sunset
without
further
stops
we
rest
awhile
and
then
go
on
by
moonlight
old
tilly
said
it
will
be
jolly
and
cool
then
besides
we
do
want
to
be
on
the
road
i
promised
mother
i
see
that

all
kept
sunday
and
go
to
church
jot
said
yes
and
go
to
church

there

to

to
anywhere
old
tilly
rejoined
quietly
i
told
mother
i
see
that
you
fellows
went
to
church
quiet
and
nice
if
possible
she
put
in
the
extra
collars
and
neckties
on
purpose
a
long
rest
with
a
hearty
lunch
and
then
they
were
off
again
in
the
clear
moonlight
it
was
splendid
the
trees
the
road
the
pale
ghostly
houses
everything
had
a
weird
charmed
aspect
they
might
have
been
riding
through
fairyland
it
was
growing
late
they
knew
and
at
last
they
stopped
out
of
sheer
weariness
a
great
square
bulk
loomed
faintly
before
them
in
the
waning
moonlight
it
might
be
a
house
might
be
a
mountain
jot
spurted
on
ahead
to
reconnoiter
house
he
shouted
back
doors
open
all
quiet
guess
it
on
a
picnic
ground
i
felt
a
stair
that
seemed
to
lead
up
to
a
balcony
or
something
well
we
sleepy
enough
we
take
anything
we
can
get
yawned
kent
come
on
then
and
riding
into
what
seemed
a
yard
they
found
a
good
place
for
their
wheels
under
some
bushes
the
moon
was
too
low
to
give
them
any
light
but
the
boys
found
the
doorway
to
the
big
building
and
went
up
the
stairs
guided
by
their
hands
along
the
narrow
passageway
they
could
only
discern
a
queer
little
enclosure
topped
by
a
little
rail
they
were
too
thoroughly
tired
out
to
be
curious
and
feeling
some
narrow
seats
they
lay
down
and
making
themselves
comfortable
were
soon
asleep
jot
was
dreaming
that
old
tilly
had
made
him
go
to
church
and
the
people
were
singing
when
suddenly
he
opened
his
eyes
was
he
dreaming
over
him
floated
a
sweet
hymn
one
his
mother
loved
to
join
in
singing
at
church
sunday
morning
the
boy
eyes
opened
wider
still
at
sight
of
flecks
of
sunshine
dancing
on
the
walls
near
and
raising
his
head
he
saw
through
the
clear
little
panes
of
a
long
window
where
the
green
leaves
were
dancing
against
the
glass
the
singing
went
on
and
the
boy
raised
himself
in
a
wondering
fashion
upon
his
elbow
where
were
they
jot
lifted
his
head
still
higher
and
glancing
over
the
railing
he
looked
down
upon
a
goodly
company
the
amazement
on
his
face
grew
greater
instead
of
less
they
were
in
church
that
was
sure
jot
looked
back
to
his
sleeping
companions
and
held
his
breath
as
one
of
them
stirred
uneasily
what
if
he
should
roll
off
the
bench
the
hymn
grew
louder
and
sweeter
and
jot
smoothed
out
his
hair
and
straightened
his
necktie
and
sat
up
straight
the
branches
outside
tapped
the
narrow
small
paned
window
near
him
and
from
the
open
windows
below
the
sweet
beauty
of
the
summer
morning
stole
in
but
as
the
minister
rose
to
give
out
his
text
a
sound
from
one
of
the
boys
back
of
him
caused
jot
to
turn
chapter
iv
jot
turned
in
his
narrow
seat
there
in
the
church
gallery
as
he
heard
a
sound
that
made
him
think
his
brothers
were
waking
but
old
tilly
had
only
stirred
in
his
sleep
and
struck
out
a
little
jarringly
against
the
back
of
the
narrow
gallery
pew
jot
turned
back
and
scanned
the
place
they
had
so
innocently
taken
for
their
quarters
the
night
before
the
gallery
pew
they
were
in
was
like
a
tiny
room
with
seats
running
around
three
sides
and
up
to
the
queer
door
on
the
fourth
side
the
walls
of
the
pews
were
almost
as
high
as
jot
head
if
he
had
dared
to
stand
up
kent
stirred
uneasily
and
threw
out
his
arm
with
a
smart
rap
against
the
side
jot
crept
across
to
him
in
terror
sh
sh
keep
quiet
breathe
you
in
meeting
he
whispered
the
minister
down
there
preaching
now
oh
sh
lem
me
but
jot
hand
cut
off
the
rest
the
other
hand
gently
shook
kent
arm
i
tell
you
we
in
meeting
do
make
a
sound
who
making
a
sound
whispered
kent
now
thoroughly
awake
was
jot
taken
suddenly
crazy
hark
who
was
that
talking
if
you
do
believe
me
raise
your
eye
over
that
wall
and
sec
what
whispered
jot
eagerly
he
drew
kent
up
beside
him
and
they
peeped
carefully
over
kent
dropped
back
as
jot
had
done
in
sheer
surprise
the
two
boys
gazed
at
each
other
silently
it
was
too
much
for
kent
though
and
to
suppress
a
laugh
he
stuffed
his
handkerchief
in
his
mouth
kent
pointed
to
old
tilly
and
smiled
broadly
he
promised
mother
he
take
us
to
meeting
he
whispered
and
done
it
yes
but
she
would
like
to
see
him
asleep
in
church
jot
whispered
hack
below
them
the
minister
deep
voice
tolled
on
solemnly
they
could
not
catch
all
the
words
come
on
i
going
to
sit
up
like
folks
i
want
to
hear
what
saying
jot
whispered
after
awhile
they
smoothed
their
hair
and
tried
to
straighten
collars
and
ties
and
then
suddenly
some
of
the
people
down
below
in
the
body
of
the
church
glanced
up
and
saw
two
boyish
faces
side
by
side
in
the
gallery
the
puzzle
was
beyond
unraveling
the
women
prodded
each
other
gently
with
their
parasol
tips
and
raised
their
eyebrows
the
men
looked
blank
when
had
those
youngsters
got
up
there
in
that
pew
one
of
the
deacons
scowled
a
little
but
the
two
quiet
brown
faces
allayed
his
suspicions
it
was
mischief
it
was
mystery
the
sight
that
had
met
jot
astonished
eyes
in
the
beginning
was
a
quaint
one
this
was
a
new
kind
of
a
church
at
home
there
were
rows
upon
rows
of
seats
with
the
hymn
books
and
fans
in
the
racks
making
the
only
break
to
the
monotony
here
the
pews
were
all
little
square
rooms
with
high
partitions
and
doors
the
hard
board
seats
ran
round
them
all
so
that
in
some
of
them
people
were
sitting
directly
back
to
the
minister
rows
on
rows
of
the
little
rooms
like
cells
jutted
against
each
other
and
filled
up
the
entire
space
below
save
the
aisles
and
the
pulpit
illustration
this
was
a
new
kind
of
church
and
the
pulpit
jot
eyes
returned
to
it
constantly
in
wondering
admiration
there
was
a
steep
flight
of
stairs
leading
up
to
it
on
each
side
and
an
enormous
was
poised
heavily
above
it
the
pulpit
itself
was
round
and
tail
and
hung
above
the
heads
of
the
congregation
making
the
practice
of
looking
up
at
the
good
old
minister
a
process
directly
beneath
the
pulpit
was
a
seat
facing
the
people
it
was
empty
now
but
a
hundred
years
ago
had
the
lads
but
known
it
the
deacons
had
sat
there
and
the
whose
duty
it
was
to
go
about
waking
up
the
dozers
with
his
long
wand
it
was
called
the
deacon
seat
and
if
sometimes
the
deacons
themselves
had
dropped
off
into
peaceful
naps
what
then
did
the
nudge
them
sharply
with
his
stick
or
was
he
dozing
too
there
are
still
a
few
of
these
old
landmarks
left
in
the
country
now
and
then
we
run
across
them
and
get
a
distinct
flavor
of
old
times
and
it
is
worth
going
a
good
many
miles
to
see
the
inside
of
one
of
them
by
just
shutting
one
eyes
and
making
believe
a
little
how
easy
it
would
be
to
conjure
up
our
dear
old
grandmothers
in
their
great
scoop
bonnets
and
grandfathers
with
their
high
coat
collars
coming
nearly
to
their
bald
crowns
and
the
deacon
seat
under
the
pulpit
how
easy
to
make
believe
the
deacons
in
coats
and
queer
frilled
shirt
bosoms
the
people
jot
and
kent
saw
were
ordinary
modern
people
and
their
modern
clothes
looked
oddly
out
of
date
against
the
quaint
old
setting
jot
thought
with
a
twinge
of
sympathy
how
hard
the
seats
must
feel
and
how
shoulders
must
ache
against
the
perfectly
backs
he
felt
a
sudden
pity
for
his
and
and
aunts
this
especial
old
church
and
unchurchly
without
and
ancient
within
was
rarely
used
for
worship
except
in
the
summer
months
then
there
were
services
in
it
as
often
as
a
minister
could
be
found
to
conduct
them
the
three
young
adventurers
had
stumbled
upon
it
in
the
dark
and
overslept
out
of
sheer
physical
weariness
it
was
up
in
one
of
the
old
choir
pews
in
the
high
gallery
they
had
wakened
or
jot
had
wakened
to
the
strains
of
the
beautiful
hymn
his
mother
loved
the
whole
explanation
was
simple
enough
when
it
was
explained
kent
and
jot
worked
it
out
slowly
in
their
own
minds
meanwhile
old
tilly
slept
on
and
the
sermon
came
to
an
end
there
was
another
hymn
and
then
the
benediction
the
people
dispersed
slowly
and
once
more
the
big
house
was
deserted
then
jot
woke
old
tilly
i
say
he
cried
i
say
old
fellow
wake
up
yes
i
coming
in
a
minute
muttered
old
tilly
you
be
late
for
church
remarked
kent
dryly
with
a
wink
at
jot
old
tilly
stirred
and
rose
on
his
elbow
then
he
gave
a
bewildered
look
around
him
you
in
church
did
you
promise
mother
you
take
us
to
church
yes
but
you
slept
all
through
the
service
said
kent
and
i
shall
tell
mother
so
kent
eddy
what
are
you
trying
to
get
at
how
did
we
get
here
anyhow
said
old
tilly
rising
cautiously
and
then
as
he
looked
down
on
the
empty
room
below
standing
to
his
full
height
he
said
well
if
i
ever
a
laugh
breaking
through
his
white
teeth
i
should
say
we
had
been
in
church
he
added
why
did
you
fellows
wake
me
up
what
did
the
folks
think
oh
they
only
saw
the
two
good
boys
sitting
on
the
seat
facing
them
we
did
say
we
had
another
one
smuggled
in
under
beside
us
but
my
you
did
rap
the
seat
awfully
once
with
your
elbow
well
i
know
one
thing
my
shoulder
aches
from
lying
on
that
narrow
seat
so
long
said
old
tilly
i
say
let
go
down
to
the
wheels
and
the
grub
i
half
starved
all
right
said
kent
in
rather
a
subdued
way
the
morning
service
had
stolen
pleasingly
through
him
and
somehow
it
seemed
to
the
little
lad
as
though
their
ship
had
been
guided
into
a
wonderfully
quiet
harbor
and
now
he
followed
his
brothers
down
the
narrow
stairs
that
they
had
so
innocently
groped
their
way
up
in
darkness
the
night
before
the
three
had
agreed
to
leave
the
church
and
partake
of
the
lunch
that
was
in
the
baskets
on
the
wheels
but
now
they
found
doing
so
not
as
easy
of
accomplishment
as
they
had
at
first
thought
when
they
tried
the
outer
door
they
found
to
their
dismay
that
it
was
locked
old
tilly
would
not
believe
kent
and
he
pushed
the
latter
hand
off
the
door
knob
rather
impatiently
let
me
get
hold
of
it
but
rattle
the
door
as
he
might
he
could
not
stir
the
rusty
lock
well
we
locked
in
that
sure
said
kent
looking
almost
dismayed
chapter
i
guess
you
right
jotham
old
tilly
said
but
what
in
the
world
did
they
go
and
lock
up
for
when
we
got
in
just
as
easy
as
pie
last
night
exclaimed
kent
disgustedly
oh
ask
something
easy
jot
cried
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
going
to
get
on
the
other
side
o
that
door
the
if
one
could
call
him
that
of
the
old
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
take
care
of
it
or
it
may
have
been
that
the
key
chanced
to
be
in
his
pocket
convenient
at
all
events
the
door
was
securely
fastened
the
three
boys
reluctantly
gave
up
the
attempt
to
force
it
windows
kent
suddenly
exclaimed
and
they
all
laughed
foolishly
they
had
not
thought
of
the
windows
that
a
good
joke
on
the
eddy
boys
old
tilly
said
we
hear
the
last
of
it
if
anybody
lets
on
to
father
better
wait
till
we
on
the
other
side
of
the
windows
advised
kent
maybe
it
is
a
joke
there
were
windows
enough
they
were
ranged
in
monotonous
rows
on
all
sides
of
the
church
above
and
below
they
all
had
tiny
panes
of
glass
and
were
fastened
with
wooden
buttons
it
was
the
work
of
a
minute
to
unbutton
one
of
them
and
jump
out
there
breathed
jot
in
relief
as
his
toes
touched
sod
again
i
feel
as
if
i
been
in
prison
and
just
got
out
broken
out
that
the
way
i
feel
i
wish
we
could
fasten
the
window
again
old
tilly
said
thoughtfully
kent
was
rubbing
his
ankle
ruefully
it
was
a
joke
on
us
our
mooning
round
that
door
all
that
time
and
thinking
we
were
trapped
oh
well
come
on
it
does
matter
now
we
free
again
come
along
here
are
our
wheels
all
right
old
tilly
said
briskly
let
go
down
to
that
little
bunch
of
white
houses
there
under
the
hill
and
pick
out
the
one
we
want
to
stay
over
night
in
the
one
that
wants
us
to
stay
in
it
you
mean
come
on
then
it
was
already
the
beautiful
sunday
peace
that
broods
over
new
england
country
places
rested
softly
on
fields
and
bits
of
pasture
and
woods
the
boys
hearts
were
made
tender
by
the
service
they
had
so
unexpectedly
attended
and
as
the
beauty
of
the
scene
recalled
again
the
home
fields
they
fell
into
silence
a
tiny
bird
tilted
on
a
twig
and
sang
to
them
as
they
passed
the
little
throat
throbbed
and
pulsated
with
eager
melody
old
tilly
listened
to
the
song
to
its
close
then
swung
round
suddenly
his
face
was
like
father
when
he
got
up
from
his
knees
at
family
prayers
that
bird
seems
singing
holy
holy
old
tilly
said
softly
ca
you
hear
yes
i
hear
murmured
jot
the
little
white
house
they
picked
out
sat
back
from
the
highway
in
a
nest
of
lilac
bushes
it
reminded
the
boys
a
very
little
of
home

over
night

boys
away

the
old
woman
in
the
doorway
held
out
both
hands
welcomingly
she
seemed
to
get
at
the
history
of
the
three
young
knights
by
some
instinctive
of
her
own
the
boys
themselves
said
so
little
it
was
the
little
old
lady
sweet
voice
that
ran
on
without
periods
piecing
old
tilly
brief
explanatory
words
together

stooped
and

a
placid
attempt
at
sternness
i
hope

she
cried
jot
face

oddly

subduedly

she
added
innocently
kent
nudged
jot
delightedly
they
were
entering
a
quaint
room
and
at
the
further
end
on
a
settle
lay
a
withered
morsel
of
an
old
man
his
face
made
a
shriveled
spot
of
color
against
the
pillows
that
pa
the
little
old
lady
said
by
way
of
introduction

broke
off
with
a
quiver
in
her
thin
clear
voice

on
the
couch
put
out
his
hand
feebly
and
smoothed
her
skirt
we
had
three
boys

explained
quietly
that

long
to

up
three
old
tilly
and
the
others
stood
by
in
odd
embarrassment
jot
was
bothered
with
a
strange
sensation
in
his
throat
but
the
old
lady
sorrowing
face
brightened
presently
she
bustled
about
the
room
busily
getting
out
chairs
and
setting
straight
things
crooked
in
her
zeal
i
guess
you
hungry
ai
you
boys
always
is
an
three
boys

how
hungry

entertainin
the
bread

just
like

with
a
delicious
crust
and
the
butter
yellow
as
gold
and
jot
helped
himself
plentifully
ma
behind
the
tea
urn
watched
him
with
a
beaming
face
that
right
i
love
to
see

tell

can
just
see

one
of
ma
good
meals
o
victuals
you
must
have
some
of
this
custard
joey
a
faint
essence
of
added
tenderness
crept
into
the
wistful
old
voice
at
that
name
the
boys
knew
that
joey
had
been
the
little
old
lady
baby
joey
was
a
great
hand
for
custard
joey
was
a
master
hearty
boy
after
supper
the
boys
wandered
out
around
the
tiny
farm
it
was
at
best
a
rocky
uneven
place
but
there
were
evidences
of
pa
hard
work
on
it
most
of
the
grass
had
been
mowed
and
carried
into
the
barn
but
there
was
one
small
field
still
dotted
over
with
cocks
of
overripe
hay
old
tilly
strode
over
and
examined
it
with
an
air
of
wisdom
too
ripe
he
commented
i
guess
it
wo
be
worth
getting
in
if
it
stays
out
here
much
longer
he
meant
to
have
it
all
in
yesterday
she
said
he
did
i
mean
that
little
old
lady
said
so
jot
remarked
well
if
it
is
all
in
it
a
goner
old
tilly
said
decisively
now
boys
there
lots
o
good
water
out
in
the
cistern
the
old
lady
said
when
they
came
back
i
put
the
towels
handy
in
the
shed
it
may
be
you
sleep
sounder
if
you
have
a
nice
sponge
off
only
too
glad
the
boys
took
to
the
shed
and
then
followed
their
guide
to
the
airy
room
waiting
how
the
pillows
fitted
a
fellow
head
as
jot
said
luxuriously
and
the
beds
how
good
they
felt
after
those
hard
church
pews
they
were
sound
asleep
in
a
moment
the
little
old
lady
stole
in
to
look
at
them
she
held
the
lamp
high
in
one
hand
and
gazed
down
with
wistful
eyes
into
the
three
healthy
brown
faces
when
she
went
back
to
pa
her
face
was
wet
with
a
rain
of
tears
they
look
so
good
pa
lyin
there
she
said
brokenly
an
ought
to
see
how
much
like
joey
the
littlest
one
throws
up
his
arm
the
old
man
could
not
sleep
he
kept
asking
if
it
looked
like
rain
and
kept
fretting
because
he
could
not
move
his
legs
about
freely
i
got
to
move
ma
he
i
got
to
practice
before
so
to
get
the
hay
in
i
got
to
get
the
hay
in
ma
it
was
jot
for
a
wonder
who
slept
the
longest
he
woke
with
a
start
of
surprise
at
his
strange
surroundings
then
he
sat
up
in
bed
blinking
his
eyes
open
wider
the
room
was
a
large
one
with
two
beds
in
it
he
and
kent
had
slept
in
one
and
old
tilly
in
the
other
it
was
just
before
sunrise
and
in
the
east
a
wide
swathe
of
pink
was
banding
the
sky
outside
the
window
a
crowd
of
little
birds
were
tuning
up
for
a
concert
jot
rubbed
his
eyes
again
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
the
other
boys
had
vanished
completely
he
leaped
out
of
bed
with
a
queer
sense
of
fright
then
he
made
a
discovery
chapter
vi
come
on
haying
begun
the
note
read
it
was
in
kent
angular
boyish
hand
and
jot
found
it
pinned
conspicuously
to
the
frame
old
till
and
i
are
at
it
come
on
out
so
that
was
it
they
were
getting
in
the
poor
little
morsel
of
an
old
man
hay
jot
jumped
into
his
clothes
with
a
leap
and
was
out
in
the
with
them
he
was
inclined
to
be
cross
at
being
left
dozing
while
the
work
began
i
call
that
shabby
mean
he
protested
why
could
you
wake
a
fellow
up
i
guess
i
like
a
hand
in
helping
the
old
man
out
as
well
as
either
of
you
wake
you
up
laughed
kent
did
i
tickle
the
soles
of
your
feet
did
i
pinch
you
what
more
do
you
want
you
would
wake
up
jot
old
tilly
said
cheerfully
i
took
a
hand
at
it
myself
but
nothing
this
side
of
a
brass
band
would
done
it
this
morning
we
could
bring
that
in
you
know
for
fear
of
waking
the
folks
so
kent
wrote
you
a
letter
the

on
splendidly
they

all
in
fine
haying
trim
and
the
cocks
in
the
rough
little
field
were
tossed
briskly
into
the
rack
there
were
three
loads
and
the
last
one

safely
stowed
in

earlier
all
the
morning
the
boys
wondered
at
the
stream
of
wagons
traveling
their
way
then
just
at
noon
they
found
out
what
it
meant
they
came
round
a
sharp
curve
in
the
road
upon
a
beautiful
grove
on
the
shore
of
a
lake
it
was
gay
with
flags
and
the
bright
dresses
of
women
and
children
here
and
there
an
awning
or
tent
dotted
the
green
spaces
people
were
bustling
about
in
all
directions
laughing
and
shouting
to
each
other
and
every
few
minutes
there
were
new
arrivals

the
three
young
knights
were
presently
in
the
midst
of
the
gay
crowd
as
gay
as
anybody
the
afternoon
was
full
of
fun
for
them
they
made
plenty
of
acquaintances
among
the
other
farmer
boys
and
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
with
the
hearty
zest
of
boys
out
holidaying
they
were
a
little
careful
about
not
being
too
free
with
their
we
out
on
a
long
run
you
know
old
tilly
said
but
what
they
did
spend
went
for
their
share
of
the
entertainment
given
so
freely
to
them
by
the
big
granger
who
had
taken
them
in
tow
it
was
a
day
filled
with
a
round
of
pleasure
as
jot
had
predicted
the
athletic
contests
on
the
primitive
little
proved
the
greatest
attraction
of
all
there
were
bicycle
races
after
the
and
and
high
jumping
jot
longed
to
vault
into
his
own
wheel
and
whirl
round
the
track
dizzily
like
the
rest
of
them
he
and
kent
stood
together
close
to
the
they
had
somehow
drifted
away
from
old
tilly
a
new
race
began
and
up
at
the
there
seemed
to
be
a
good
deal
of
hilarity
the
hearty
laughs
were
tantalizing
what
is
it
why
do
they
come
on
and
give
us
fellows
a
chance
to
laugh
too
exclaimed
jot
impatiently
kent
was
peering
sharply
between
his
hands
he
suddenly
began
to
laugh
it
a
slow
race
he
cried
they
trying
to
see
who
can
get
behind
come
on
up
further
where
we
can
see
it
be
great
come
along
then
hurry
shouted
jot

but
they
got
to
be
slower
than
old
tilly
ca
do
it
whispered
jot
old
tilly
can
sit
still
on
his
bike
i
hope

the
race

panted
it
would
be
mean
if

a
good
place
there
they
come

slow
as

jot
they
caught
off
their
caps
and
cheered
wildly
else
joined
in
catching
at
the
name
and
laughing
over
it
as
a
good
joke
hurrah
hurrah
for
old
tilly
hip
hip
a
tiger
for
old
the
called
time
and
old
tilly
descended
from
his
victorious
wheel
and
bowed
profoundly
to
his
cheerers
he
walked
away
to
join
the
other
boys
with
the
exaggerated
air
of
a
great
victor
and
the
people
shouted
again
oh
i
say
that
was
rich
old
till
gasped
jot
that
was
worth
a
farm
what
made
you
think
of
entering
kent
laughed
oh
i
thought
i
would
i
knew
i
could
beat
old
tilly
said
modestly
sunset
ended
the
festivities
in
the
grove
and
the
boys
mounted
and
rode
away
with
the
other
tired
people
gradually
they
fell
behind
do
rush
so
i
got
to
keep
up
my
reputation
said
old
tilly
besides
i
tired
me
too
same
here
let
camp
out
in
the
woods
why
did
we
stay
there
and
camp
in
that
grove
well
we
might
have
but
we
wo
go
back
answered
old
tilly
come
on
let
make
for
that
pretty
little
brown
house
maybe
we
can
buy
our
supper
there
but
the
little
brown
house
was
shut
up
tight
the
curtains
were
all
pulled
down
and
a
general
air
of
not
at
home
pervaded
even
the
clapboards
and
the
vine
over
the
door
only
the
neat
little
barn
looked
hospitable
its
doors
stood
open
wide
a
distant
rumble
of
thunder
suddenly
sounded
and
the
sky
darkened
with
ominous
swiftness
going
to
rain
kent
said
sure
added
jot
look
at
those
clouds
will
you
we
better
get
into
a
hole
somewhere
we
go
into
the
barn
decided
old
tilly
after
a
minute
thought
and
if
it
rains
all
night
we
stay
there
we
ca
do
any
harm
it
rained
all
night
shower
after
shower
burst
over
them
heavily
and
there
was
a
continual
boom
of
thunder
in
their
ears
a
slight
respite
at
midnight
was
followed
by
the
most
terrific
shower
of
all
the
boys
huddled
together
in
the
hay
with
faces
but
unafraid
they
could
not
sleep
in
such
a
magnificent
tumult
of
nature
suddenly
there
was
a
blinding
flash
of
lightning
then
a
crash
the
whole
universe
seemed
tottering
about
them
dizzy
and
stunned
they
gazed
at
each
other
unable
to
move
for
an
instant
then
it
was
jot
who
sprang
up
in
tremulous
haste
i
smell
smoke
we
afire
he
exclaimed
yes
old
tilly
cried
striving
to
be
calm
it
struck
this
barn
chapter
vii
they
darted
away
in
search
of
the
fire
the
glare
of
the
lightning
showed
them
their
way
and
presently
they
came
into
the
glare
of
the
flames
the
bolt
had
descended
through
the
harness
room
quick
cattle
first
shouted
old
tilly
clearly
we
must
save
the
cattle
anyway
you
go
to
them
you
two
i
going
to
the
pump
called
back
kent
decisively
he
remembered
there
was
a
pump
just
outside
the
barn
and
he
was
sure
he
had
seen
two
or
three
pails
standing
about
near
it
yes
there
they
were
he
caught
them
up
with
a
sweep
as
he
leaped
by
it
was
the
work
of
a
moment
to
fill
two
pails
and
a
moment
more
to
dash
them
down
by
the
floor
in
one
corner
where
the
scattered
hay
was
burning
again
and
again
he
made
flying
leaps
to
the
pump
and
back
meanwhile
the
other
two
boys
were
releasing
the
frantic
cattle
it
was
no
simple
thing
to
do
the
poor
creatures
were
so
terrified
there
were
two
steers
and
a
heifer
the
boys
had
made
acquaintance
with
them
the
night
before
and
the
poor
things
greeted
them
now
with
piteous
lows
of
appeal
so
boss
so
boss
soothed
jot
at
the
heifer
head
his
trembling
fingers
caressed
the
smooth
nose
as
with
the
other
hand
he
untied
her
she
crouched
back
at
first
and
refused
to
pass
that
terrible
flaming
something
on
the
way
to
safety
outside
but
jot
pulled
her
along
talking
to
her
all
the
way
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
of
it
the
cattle
were
out
of
danger
now
the
hens
hurry
hurry
jot
i
going
to
help
kent
it
get
to
the
hay
upstairs
thanks
to
kent
steady
tireless
work
there
was
little
danger
of
that
now
already
the
flames
were
greatly
subdued
and
only
sputtered
aimlessly
under
the
regular
showers
of
water
that
fell
upon
them
the
two
boys
toiled
over
them
patiently
till
just
a
blackened
corner
told
that
they
had
been
there
in
the
trig
little
barn
it
had
been
a
short
sharp
battle
a
moment
indecision
a
very
little
less
determined
effort
and
presence
of
mind
and
nothing
but
a
miracle
could
have
saved
the
barn
and
then
the
house
it
stood
so
near
what
could
have
saved
it
it
was
an
hour
or
more
before
old
tilly
would
allow
the
live
stock
brought
back
into
the
barn
they
hovered
anxiously
over
the
blackened
embers
for
fear
they
might
spring
into
life
again
but
at
last
there
seemed
no
danger
and
presently
the
building
settled
back
to
quiet
again
and
the
tired
rescuers
tried
to
snatch
a
little
sleep
in
the
hay
jot
woke
the
others
in
the
first
dim
daylight
fire
fire
he
screamed
where
where
is
it
cried
kent
springing
to
his
feet
put
it
mumbled
old
tilly
it
was
only
a
nightmare
but
the
boys
could
not
doze
again
after
it
it
was
just
as
the
sun
was
rising
clear
and
beautiful
that
the
boys
came
out
from
the
barn
and
as
they
caught
sight
of
each
other
blackened
faces
in
the
dazzling
light
they
each
gave
way
to
a
roar
of
laughter
well
we
all
seem
to
be
in
the
same
boat
said
kent
making
for
the
pump
and
filling
the
pails
one
after
the
other
here
a
pail
apiece
that
ought
to
do
it
for
us
then
he
went
to
one
of
the
wheel
baskets
and
brought
back
a
crash
towel
and
a
generous
piece
of
soap
now
lay
to
on
yourselves
boys
and
then
we
will
see
what
we
can
scare
up
for
breakfast
i
suppose
there
no
getting
into
the
house
so
we
have
to
depend
on
ourselves
but
here
kent
noticed
how
particularly
quiet
old
tilly
was
what
up
lad
he
said
as
he
plunged
his
face
down
into
one
of
the
dripping
pails
and
then
after
scrubbing
and
sputtering
for
a
while
he
reached
out
blindly
for
a
towel
which
one
of
the
others
tossed
into
his
hands
when
his
eyes
were
free
he
drew
a
long
breath
saying
water
fixes
a
fellow
all
right
but
as
he
did
this
he
noticed
something
that
made
him
exclaim
sharply
it
was
the
sight
of
old
tilly
washing
himself
with
one
hand
while
around
the
wrist
of
the
other
a
grimy
handkerchief
was
bound
why
did
you
say
you
were
hurt
he
said
coming
over
to
old
tilly
side
what
is
it
anyway
oh
it
nothing
said
old
tilly
with
an
impatient
nod
of
his
head
maybe
it
where
the
lightning
ran
down
he
said
with
a
laugh
lightning
not
much
come
out
with
it
what
is
it
oh
it
just
a
tear
on
an
old
nail
one
of
those
steers
got
a
little
ugly
and
i
jumped
back
too
suddenly
it
nothing
we
have
to
take
your
word
for
it
said
kent
but
he
very
soberly
turned
to
the
lunch
baskets
it
was
just
as
they
had
packed
up
everything
neatly
and
were
mounting
their
wheels
to
ride
away
that
a
wagon
came
rumbling
down
the
grassy
road
and
turned
in
to
the
farmyard
a
young
man
with
a
limp
felt
hat
was
on
the
seat
with
a
woman
wearing
a
brown
straw
hat
while
a
tiny
girl
in
a
pink
sunbonnet
was
nestled
down
between
them
halloo
said
the
man
as
he
saw
the
boys
just
leavin
yes
sir
said
old
tilly
respectfully
we
took
the
liberty
of
sleeping
in
your
barn
last
night
you
see
the
storm
kept
us
there
all
night
well
the
storm
kept
us
too
said
the
young
farmer
reaching
for
the
little
child
and
setting
her
down
by
the
pump
and
then
helping
the
woman
to
alight
the
young
woman
gave
a
relieved
look
around
first
at
the
barn
and
then
at
the
house
and
said
delightedly
oh
jim
how
good
it
does
seem
to
see
everything
safe
i
ca
believe
my
eyes
hardly
and
she
added
turning
to
the
boys
with
a
slightly
embarrassed
laugh
i
never
was
very
good
to
stay
away
from
home
nights
and
we
did
mean
to
stay
last
night
but
the
rain
kept
us
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
with
every
clap
of
thunder
we
find
everything
burned
to
ashes
and
the
whole
place
gone
tears
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
turned
and
gave
her
hand
to
the
little
child
well
i
going
in
to
get
breakfast
she
said
a
glad
tremulous
light
showing
across
her
face
you
better
bring
these
boys
in
to
breakfast
jim
if
they
just
slept
in
the
barn
they
must
be
hungry
then
turning
back
again
with
a
heartier
laugh
i
feel
that
glad
to
see
everything
even
to
the
chickens
just
as
we
left
them
that
i
would
object
to
asking
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
breakfast
you
ai
from
around
here
are
you
she
asked
looking
at
the
boys
i
thought
not
and
you
hungry
i
wager
she
said
as
she
bustled
away
with
the
little
girl
tugging
at
her
skirts
not
waiting
for
the
boys
to
disaffirm
as
they
most
assuredly
would
have
done
had
a
chance
been
given
them
for
they
were
not
in
the
least
hungry
but
then
what
was
a
cold
luncheon
taken
from
a
bicycle
basket
compared
with
a
warm
breakfast
that
might
include
ham
and
eggs
she
awfully
nervous
nancy
is
said
the
young
farmer
a
trifle
apologetically
she
would
have
it
at
brother
ed
that
she
was
being
burned
out
of
house
and
home
we
ought
to
have
stayed
but
brother
ed
urged
us
to
go
home
with
him
she
always
that
way
when
she
away
we
ridden
nineteen
miles
since
daybreak
and
she
believed
every
mile
that
we
were
going
to
see
a
house
at
the
end
well
said
old
tilly
in
a
quiet
way
so
as
not
to
alarm
the
young
farmer
i
guess
she
was
about
right
this
time
if
we
had
happened
here
then
he
slipped
back
into
the
barn
and
the
young
farmer
followed
after
and
old
tilly
pointed
to
the
blackened
corner
while
the
other
two
drew
near
interestedly
you
see
how
it
struck
old
tilly
said
quietly
but
we
put
it
out
after
a
while
it
is
well
we
happened
to
be
right
here
the
young
farmer
was
gazing
at
the
burned
place
with
his
jaw
dropped
and
a
look
of
terror
coming
into
his
blue
eyes
it
did
strike
i
should
say
it
did
he
cried
excitedly
what
will
nancy
say
illustration
i
should
say
it
did
strike
he
cried
excitedly
then
as
a
realization
came
to
him
that
it
was
owing
to
the
boys
that
they
had
a
roof
over
their
heads
he
turned
first
to
one
lad
and
then
to
the
other
and
shook
their
hands
heartily
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
but
he
did
not
seem
conscious
of
them
i
do
know
what
nancy
say
he
reiterated
as
he
shook
one
hand
after
the
other
up
and
down
like
a
pump
handle
we
have
to
be
everlastingly
obliged
to
you
for
the
rest
of
our
days
he
said
trying
to
laugh
a
little
but
his
voice
choked
and
he
turned
away
to
hide
his
emotion
then
he
dropped
down
upon
a
and
insisted
on
hearing
the
story
from
beginning
to
end
although
old
tilly
declared
time
and
again
with
the
other
two
joining
in
that
it
was
nothing
you
call
it
nothing
well
you
wait
until
you
worked
half
a
lifetime
as
nancy
and
me
have
done
to
get
a
place
and
then
see
what
you
think
about
it
i
guess
nancy
believe
it
something
then
he
stopped
as
a
clear
call
breakfast
breakfast
came
ringing
out
to
them
from
the
open
door
beyond
the
pump
perhaps
we
better
not
say
anything
about
it
until
after
breakfast
she
had
a
powerful
uneasy
night
and
it
been
a
good
bit
of
a
ride
over
too
to
this
the
boys
assented
and
the
four
walked
across
the
yard
to
the
kitchen
door
where
the
little
girl
was
shyly
waiting
for
them
ai
you
the
young
chap
that
beat
in
the
bicycle
slow
race
asked
nancy
when
she
caught
a
sight
of
tilly
face
as
he
removed
his
hat
the
other
two
boys
laughed
and
the
farmer
looking
squarely
at
his
visitor
said
well
i
thought
i
seen
you
somewhere
and
then
they
settled
down
to
breakfast
in
the
happiest
frame
of
mind
evidently
that
could
be
imagined
but
all
the
time
old
tilly
kept
one
hand
down
at
his
side
a
little
out
of
sight
and
the
boys
noticed
that
he
took
upon
his
plate
only
such
things
as
he
could
very
easily
manage
with
one
hand
the
breakfast
for
a
hurried
one
was
very
satisfactory
indeed
jot
and
kent
ate
with
full
appreciation
of
it
but
had
they
watched
closely
they
would
have
seen
how
old
tilly
face
now
flushed
and
then
grew
pale
and
that
occasionally
he
brought
his
lips
together
as
though
striving
to
control
himself
but
all
unmindful
of
what
the
boy
was
undergoing
nancy
presided
merrily
over
the
table
and
kept
prompting
jim
to
fill
up
the
plates
as
they
needed
it
and
pressed
this
and
that
upon
the
boys
attention
i
do
feel
as
if
i
should
ever
want
to
go
away
again
she
cried
it
so
good
to
be
at
home
i
been
through
every
room
in
the
house
and
taken
a
view
of
them
all
and
then
she
said
laughingly
turning
to
the
boys
not
that
there
are
so
very
many
of
but
they
all
got
you
know
after
breakfast
we
going
out
to
the
barn
ai
we
polly
she
added
but
now
kent
noticed
that
jot
face
had
suddenly
sobered
he
was
looking
at
old
tilly
anxiously
he
had
seen
his
hand
come
up
from
beneath
the
table
and
he
was
sure
that
the
handkerchief
was
spotted
with
red
i
say
old
tilly
jot
got
to
his
feet
hastily
but
old
tilly
face
was
white
and
he
was
swaying
from
side
to
side
old
tilly
was
fainting
away
chapter
viii
i
i
awake
now
what
the
matter
who
sick
old
tilly
sat
up
dizzily
he
had
lost
consciousness
only
for
a
moment
but
his
face
seemed
to
be
growing
whiter
and
whiter
jot
and
kent
hovered
over
him
anxiously
you
got
kind
of
faint
old
till
just
for
a
minute
you
all
right
now
kent
said
of
course
i
all
right
i
always
was
i
do
see
what
you
making
such
a
fuss
about
but
the
pale
face
belied
his
words
kent
lifted
the
clumsily
bandaged
hand
and
unwound
the
handkerchief
it
was
stained
with
blood
oh
what
have
you
done
kent
you
should
have
taken
the
bandage
off
exclaimed
jot
in
fright
see
how
the
blood
is
dripping
from
the
cloth
it
nothing
i
tell
you
growled
old
tilly
wind
the
thing
up
again
it
only
a
nail
tear
old
tilly
was
swaying
again
and
they
forced
him
gently
back
the
little
woman
looked
up
startled
what
is
it
jim
how
did
it
happen
she
quavered
jim
face
looked
very
sober
i
guess
i
better
fetch
the
doctor
he
said
he
hurt
it
on
a
nail
he
says
i
wo
stop
to
harness
up
old
betty
used
to
bein
rode
bareback
he
hurried
away
followed
by
his
wife
jot
was
examining
the
torn
wrist
tenderly
some
new
untried
strength
seemed
to
spring
into
the
brown
boyish
face
it
took
on
the
lines
of
a
man
it
an
artery
kentie
i
know
because
the
blood
leaps
up
so
when
the
handkerchief
is
off
it
ca
have
been
bleeding
all
night
i
understand
it
bled
some
last
night
said
old
tilly
but
i
stopped
it
i
guess
i
hit
it
someway
just
now
against
the
table
it
began
again
worse
than
ever
cover
it
up
ca
you
it
all
right
it
is
all
right
get
me
a
little
stick
quick
kentie
no
that
fork
do
hand
it
here
this
bleeding
got
to
stop
it
seemed
odd
that
it
should
be
jot
little
wild
jot
who
should
take
the
lead
in
that
calm
determined
way
what
had
come
to
the
boy
with
pale
face
and
set
teeth
he
quietly
bound
the
handkerchief
tightly
above
the
wrist
and
inserting
the
fork
handle
in
the
knot
twisted
it
about
the
bleeding
lessened
stopped
there
now
if
i
keep
a
good
grip
on
it
oh
i
say
kentie
was
i
afraid
i
could
work
it
he
said
breathing
hard
i
do
see
how
you
did
work
it
i
do
see
how
you
ever
thought
of
it
jot
eddy
well
i
did
i
read
how
it
was
done
up
in
the
consultery
father
may
laugh
but
i
going
to
be
a
doctor
kent
face
was
full
of
respect
he
suddenly
remembered
that
it
was
jot
who
had
set
rover
broken
leg
and
nursed
the
little
sick
calf
that
father
set
such
store
by
i
guess
father
wo
laugh
kent
said
soberly
jot
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
lounge
holding
the
fork
in
a
firm
grasp
old
tilly
opened
his
eyes
and
nodded
approvingly
that
what
i
tried
to
do
myself
with
the
handkerchief
bind
it
tight
it
was
very
bad
at
first
but
i
jerked
it
or
something
i
want
you
fellows
good
time
spoiled
that
just
like
you
burst
out
kent
you
never
tell
when
you
get
hurt
for
fear
other
folks
be
bothered
the
little
woman
crept
back
into
the
kitchen
and
went
quietly
about
her
work
the
doctor
soon
came
and
in
a
brief
time
the
artery
was
taken
up
and
the
hand
deftly
bandaged
which
of
you
fellows
made
that
tourniquet
with
the
fork
the
doctor
asked
brusquely
kent
pointed
proudly
to
jot
oh
it
was
you
was
it
well
you
did
a
mighty
good
thing
for
your
brother
there
he
have
lost
plenty
of
blood
before
i
got
here
if
you
had
the
whole
of
that
day
and
the
next
night
the
boys
remained
at
jim
the
doctor
had
positively
objected
to
old
tilly
going
on
without
a
day
quiet
and
the
little
woman
the
little
woman
would
not
hear
of
anything
else
but
their
staying
she
had
been
out
to
the
barn
with
jim
and
seen
the
blackened
corner
after
that
she
hovered
over
the
three
boys
like
a
hen
over
her
chickens
for
to
think
jim
it
was
saving
our
home
he
got
hurt
she
cried
the
boys
talked
things
over
together
and
kent
and
jot
were
for
turning
about
and
going
straight
home
but
not
so
old
tilly
i
guess
no
sir
we
go
right
ahead
and
have
our
holiday
out
great
fun
cruising
round
like
this
but
your
hand
old
tilly
the
doctor
said
to
keep
it
quiet
he
did
say
to
sit
down
in
a
and
sing
it
to
sleep
i
guess
if
i
ca
ride
a
wheel
with
one
hand
my
name
is
nathan
eddy
it
is
laughed
kent
it
old
tilly
eddy
but
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
ghost
appeared
suddenly
over
old
tilly
the
pale
moonlight
introduced
it
timidly
as
jot
in
his
white
shirt
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
i
going
home
he
announced
in
a
whisper
you

fellows

do
as
you
like
of
course
you
can
ride
all
right
with
one
hand

hands
any
further
from

old
tilly

next
morning

be
so
set
do
you
think
he
looks
kind
of
scoffed

well
something
up
mother
put
him
in
my
care
and
i
going
to
take
him
home
i
never

if

to
jot
away
from
home
i
sorry
on
your
account
kentie
oh

ahead
i
all
right
rejoined
kent
cheerfully
i
just
as
soon
we
had
a
jolly
good
time
of
it
so
far
and
we
can
take
the
rest
of
it
out
in
going
fishing
or
camping
at
home
well
then
we
go
right
back
home
on
jot
account
i
feet
as
if
i
must
take
him
to
mother
poor
jot
it
was
hard
to
be
taken
home
that
way
when
all
the
while
was
he
taking
wounded
old
tilly
home
to
mother
it
was
the
only
way
he
had
been
able
to
work
it
out
lying
awake
and
worrying
over
the
torn
wrist
something
must
be
done
to
get
old
tilly
home
i
told
the
truth
i
said
i
was
keeping
something
back
thought
jot
i
said
i
was
sick
did
i
and
old
till
got
to
go
home
the
doctor
told
me
the
sooner
the
better
but
it
was
a
distinct
sacrifice
to
jot
pride
to
be
taken
home
to
mother
he
bore
it
remarkably
well
because
of
the
love
and
anxiety
in
his
sturdy
little
heart
he
would
do
a
good
deal
for
old
till
they
returned
by
a
more
direct
route
than
they
had
come
on
the
way
they
discussed
their
adventures
jot
counted
them
up
on
his
fingers
old
churches
little
old
man
hay
pshaw
that
was
an
adventure
jot
blushed
hotly
as
if
caught
in
some
misdeed
no
skip
that
old
tilly
said
quietly
that
just
happened
begin
over
again
old
churches
two
adventures
there
you
know
picnics
slow
races
skip
that
cried
old
tilly
no
sir
slow
races
burning
barns
arteries
oh
i
say
i
do
the
counting
up
myself
besides
you
left
out
the
very
first
adventure
did
you
the
very
first
one
yes
of
course
losing
all
our
money
before
we
started
quits
cried
jot
laughing
he
did
not
appear
sick
at
all
all
the
way
home
he
watched
old
tilly
with
almost
professional
care
and
old
tilly
unknown
to
jot
watched
him
say
jot
he
said
that
night
when
they
had
gone
upstairs
to
their
own
beds
once
more
do
you
feel
a
little
better
his
face
was
white
and
tired
and
he
nestled
in
the
pillows
gratefully
it
was
good
to
be
at
home
do
you
feel
a
good
deal
better
me
asked
innocent
jot
i
feel
jolly
never
felt
oh
er
i
mean
that
is
you
a
rascal
laughed
old
tilly
comfortably
that
what
you
mean
think
i
did
surmise
a
thing
or
two
well
honest
i
did
at
first
but
on
the
way
home
i
found
out
what
you
were
up
to
you
looked
altogether
too
healthy
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
jot
spoke
meekly
i
felt
sort
of
mean
but
i
could
help
it
honest
and
i
told
the
truth
now
i
i
was
going
to
own
up
he
went
away
into
the
next
room
and
crept
into
bed
beside
kent
jot
jot
i
say
called
old
tilly
presently
hope
you
do
think
i
mad
i
do
mind
i
i
like
it
there
was
an
indistinct
mumble
of
relief
from
jot
quarter
followed
by
another
silence
then
again
old
tilly
contented
voice
crept
through
the
dark
say
jot
you
asleep
yes
you
sound
it
feels
mighty
good
to
be
home
does
it
prime
old
chap
same
here
then
silence
unbroken
by
and
by
mother
eddy
stole
upstairs
to
her
boys
good
boys
every
one
of
them
god
bless
them
she
murmured
home
is
home
without
them
but
young
things
must
have
their
holidaying
and
i
guess
from
what
they
tell
they
made
good
use
of
theirs
and
it
is
everyone
does
that
some
of
them
just
waste
it
but
this
held
something
in
it
i
do
know
just
what
but
every
one
of
them
seems
well
sort
o
more
i
glad
their
pa
let
them
go
but
home
ai
home
without
boys
in
it
that
sure
and
she
turned
and
went
softly
down
the
stairs
