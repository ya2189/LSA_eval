to
the
best
a
boy
ever
had
except
possibly
yours
belongs
the
dedication
of
this
story
of
life
at
an
academy
since
his
goodness
enabled
me
to
know
it
and
write
it
note
about
half
of
this
book
was
published
serially
in
st
nicholas
the
rest
of
it
is
here
printed
for
the
first
time
if
in
this
story
of
life
at
a
preparatory
school
i
have
neglected
to
say
very
much
about
books
and
studies
and
have
stuck
to
far
less
interesting
matters
such
as
the
games
and
gambols
that
while
away
the
dull
hours
between
classes
i
hope
my
readers
will
graciously
forgive
the
omission
list
of
illustrations
it
was
evident
that
a
severe
struggle
had
taken
place
stop
the
train
and
wait
for
me
i
going
to
kingston
too
tug
is
treated
to
a
little
quiz
learned
to
shoot
the
hills
at
a
breathless
rate
jumbo
saw
a
pair
of
flashing
eyes
glaring
at
him
over
the
coverlet
pretty
and
enid
the
run
the
tied
up
like
dummies
in
sacks
striker
out
burning
the
books
the
dozen
from
lakerim
i
some
people
think
it
great
fun
to
build
a
house
of
cards
slowly
and
anxiously
and
then
knock
it
to
pieces
with
one
little
snip
of
the
finger
or
to
fix
up
a
snow
man
in
fine
style
and
watch
a
sudden
thaw
melt
him
out
of
sight
or
to
write
a
name
carefully
like
a
and
with
many
curlicues
in
the
wet
sand
and
then
scamper
off
and
let
the
first
high
wave
smooth
it
away
as
a
boy
sponge
wipes
from
his
slate
some
such
marvelous
statement
as
or
gives
a
koshunt
of
when
such
things
are
erased
it
does
much
matter
but
there
are
occasions
when
it
hurts
to
have
father
time
come
along
and
blot
out
the
work
you
have
taken
great
pains
with
and
have
put
your
heart
into
twelve
young
gentlemen
in
the
town
of
lakerim
were
feeling
decidedly
blue
over
just
such
an
occasion
you
may
not
find
the
town
of
lakerim
on
the
map
in
your
geography
and
yet
it
was
very
well
known
to
the
people
that
lived
in
it
and
the
lakerim
athletic
club
was
very
well
known
to
those
same
people
and
the
lakerim
athletic
club
or
at
least
the
twelve
founders
of
the
club
were
as
blue
as
the
june
sky
because
it
seemed
to
them
that
father
time
old
granddaddy
longlegs
that
he
is
was
playing
a
mean
trick
on
them
for
had
they
given
all
their
brain
and
muscle
to
building
up
an
athletic
club
that
should
be
a
credit
to
the
town
and
a
terror
to
outsiders
and
had
they
given
up
every
free
hour
for
two
years
to
working
like
trojans
though
for
that
matter
who
ever
heard
of
any
work
the
trojans
ever
did
that
amounted
to
anything
except
the
spending
of
ten
years
in
getting
themselves
badly
defeated
by
a
big
wooden
but
while
all
of
the
dozen
were
deep
in
the
dumps
and
had
their
brows
tied
up
like
a
neglected
the
loudest
complaint
was
made
of
course
by
the
one
who
had
done
the
least
work
in
building
up
the
club
a
lazybones
who
had
been
born
tired
and
had
spent
most
of
his
young
life
in
industriously
earning
for
himself
the
name
of
sleepy
it
a
shame
growled
he
for
you
fellows
to
go
and
leave
the
club
in
the
lurch
this
way
after
all
the
trouble
we
have
had
organizing
it
yes
assented
another
who
was
called
because
he
had
jumped
from
a
high
bridge
once
too
often
and
who
read
wild
western
romances
more
than
was
good
for
his
peace
of
mind
or
his
conversation
it
kind
of
looks
as
if
you
fellows
were
renegades
to
the
cause
none
of
the
twelve
knew
exactly
what
a
renegade
was
but
it
sounded
unpleasant
and
the
men
to
whom
the
term
was
applied
lost
their
tempers
and
volunteered
to
clean
out
the
where
they
all
sat
for
two
cents
but
the
offenders
either
thought
they
could
have
more
fun
for
less
money
or
had
the
money
for
they
changed
their
tune
and
the
debate
went
on
in
a
more
peaceful
manner
the
trouble
was
this
some
of
you
who
are
up
on
the
important
works
of
history
may
have
heard
how
these
twelve
youth
of
the
high
school
at
lakerim
organized
themselves
into
an
athletic
club
that
won
many
victories
and
how
they
begged
borrowed
and
earned
enough
money
to
build
themselves
a
after
a
year
of
hard
work
and
harder
play
well
now
after
they
had
gone
to
all
this
trouble
and
all
this
expense
and
had
enjoyed
the
fruits
of
their
labors
barely
a
year
lo
and
behold
one
third
of
the
dozen
were
planning
to
desert
the
club
leave
the
town
and
take
their
good
muscles
to
another
town
where
there
was
an
academy
the
worst
of
it
was
that
this
academy
was
the
very
one
that
had
worked
hardest
to
keep
the
lakerim
athletic
club
from
being
admitted
into
the
league
known
as
the
interscholastic
and
now
that
the
lakerim
club
had
forced
its
way
into
the
league
and
had
won
the
pennant
the
very
first
year
it
seemed
hard
that
some
of
the
most
valuable
of
the
lakerimmers
should
even
consider
joining
forces
with
a
rival
the
president
of
the
club
himself
was
one
of
the
deserters
and
the
rest
of
the
dozen
grew
very
bitter
and
the
arguments
often
reached
a
point
where
it
needed
only
one
word
more
to
bring
on
a
scrimmage
a
scrimmage
that
would
make
a
lively
football
game
seem
tame
by
comparison
and
now
the
president
or
tug
as
he
was
always
called
had
been
baited
long
enough
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
proceeded
to
deliver
an
oration
with
all
the
fervor
of
a
orator
making
the
eagle
scream
i
want
you
fellows
to
understand
once
for
all
he
cried
that
no
one
loves
the
lakerim
athletic
club
more
than
i
do
or
is
more
patriotic
toward
it
but
now
that
i
have
graduated
from
the
high
school
i
ca
consider
that
i
know
everything
that
is
to
be
known
there
are
one
or
two
things
to
learn
yet
and
i
intend
to
go
to
a
preparatory
school
and
then
through
college
and
the
best
thing
you
follows
can
do
is
to
make
your
plans
to
do
the
same
thing
well
now
seeing
that
my
mind
is
made
up
to
go
to
college
and
seeing
that
i
got
to
go
to
some
preparatory
school
and
seeing
there
is
no
preparatory
school
in
lakerim
and
seeing
that
i
have
therefore
got
to
go
to
some
other
town
and
seeing
that
at
kingston
there
is
a
fine
preparatory
school
and
seeing
that
i
want
to
have
some
sort
of
a
show
in
athletics
and
seeing
that
the
athletic
association
of
the
kingston
academy
has
been
kind
enough
to
specially
invite
three
of
us
fellows
to
go
there
why
seeing
all
this
i
do
see
that
there
is
any
kick
coming
to
you
fellows
if
we
three
fellows
take
advantage
of
our
opportunities
like
sensible
people
and
the
best
advice
i
can
give
you
is
to
make
up
your
minds
and
make
up
your
fathers
and
minds
to
come
along
to
kingston
academy
with
us
then
there
wo
be
any
talk
about
our
being
traitors
to
the
dozen
for
we
just
pick
the
dozen
up
bodily
and
carry
it
over
to
kingston
the
new
members
we
elected
can
take
care
of
the
club
and
the
tug
sat
down
amid
a
silence
that
was
more
complimentary
than
the
wildest
applause
for
he
had
done
what
few
orators
do
he
had
set
his
audience
to
thinking
only
one
of
the
twelve
had
a
remark
to
make
for
some
time
and
that
was
a
gnome
called
history
he
leaned
over
and
said
to
his
bobbles
tug
is
a
regular
demoskenes
who
demoskenes
whispered
bobbles
why
do
you
remember
him
said
history
proudly
he
was
the
fellow
that
used
to
fill
his
mouth
full
of
pebbles
before
he
talked
i
bet
he
would
have
choked
on
some
of
your
big
words
though
history
growled
a
little
fellow
called
jumbo
but
the
man
at
his
side
known
to
fame
as
punk
broke
in
with
a
crushing
aw
let
up
on
that
old
dutchman
of
a
demoskenes
and
let
talk
business
so
they
all
got
their
heads
together
again
and
discussed
their
affairs
with
the
solemnity
due
to
their
importance
they
talked
till
the
janitor
went
round
lighting
up
the
which
reminded
them
that
they
were
keeping
dinner
waiting
at
their
various
homes
then
they
strolled
along
home
they
met
again
and
again
for
the
fate
of
the
club
was
a
serious
matter
to
them
and
the
fate
of
the
dozen
was
a
still
more
serious
matter
because
the
dozen
had
existed
before
the
club
or
the
and
their
hearts
ached
at
the
mere
thought
of
breaking
up
the
old
and
dear
associations
that
had
grown
up
around
their
partnership
in
many
an
hour
of
victory
and
defeat
but
where
there
are
many
souls
there
are
many
minds
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
keep
the
twelve
together
for
another
year
it
was
settled
that
tug
and
jumbo
and
punk
should
accept
the
flattering
invitation
of
the
kingston
athletic
association
and
their
parents
were
glad
enough
to
have
them
go
seeing
that
kingston
was
an
academy
of
excellent
standing
history
was
also
to
be
there
for
his
learning
had
won
him
a
free
scholarship
in
a
competitive
examination
quiz
and
bobbles
were
to
be
sent
to
other
academies
to
charleston
to
troy
and
to
greenville
but
they
made
life
miserable
for
their
fathers
and
mothers
with
their
pleadings
until
they
too
were
permitted
to
join
their
fellows
at
kingston
sleepy
was
the
only
one
that
did
not
want
to
go
and
he
insisted
that
he
had
learned
all
that
was
necessary
for
his
purpose
in
life
that
he
simply
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
laboring
over
books
any
longer
but
just
as
the
dozen
had
resigned
themselves
to
losing
the
companionship
of
sleepy
he
was
a
good
man
to
crack
jokes
about
if
for
no
other
reason
sleepy
parents
announced
to
him
that
his
decision
was
not
final
and
that
whether
or
not
he
wanted
to
go
go
he
should
and
then
there
were
eight
the
handsome
and
fashionable
young
dozener
known
to
his
friends
as
edward
parker
and
to
fame
as
pretty
was
won
over
with
much
difficulty
he
had
completely
made
up
his
mind
to
attend
the
troy
latin
school
not
because
he
loved
latin
but
because
troy
was
the
seat
of
much
social
gaiety
and
because
there
was
a
large
seminary
for
girls
in
that
town
he
was
however
at
length
cajoled
into
consenting
to
pitch
his
tent
at
kingston
by
the
diplomatic
jumbo
who
told
him
that
the
girls
at
kingston
were
the
prettiest
in
three
states
and
then
there
were
nine
the
phillips
twins
reddy
and
heady
were
the
next
source
of
trouble
for
they
had
recently
indulged
in
an
unusually
violent
squabble
even
for
them
and
each
had
vowed
that
he
would
never
speak
to
the
other
again
and
would
sooner
die
than
go
to
the
same
the
father
of
this
fiery
couple
knew
that
the
boys
really
loved
each
other
dearly
at
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
and
decided
to
teach
them
how
much
they
truly
cared
for
each
other
so
he
yielded
to
their
prayer
that
they
be
allowed
to
go
to
different
academies
the
boys
in
high
glee
tossed
up
a
penny
to
decide
which
should
go
with
the
dozen
to
kingston
and
which
should
go
to
the
brownsville
school
for
boys
reddy
won
kingston
and
rejoiced
greatly
but
though
heady
was
so
blue
that
his
hair
was
almost
dyed
nothing
could
persuade
him
to
tag
along
after
his
brother
as
he
phrased
it
and
so
there
were
ten
the
deepest
grief
of
the
dozen
was
the
plight
of
the
beloved
giant
there
seemed
to
be
no
possible
way
of
getting
him
to
kingston
much
as
they
thought
of
his
big
muscles
and
more
us
they
thought
of
his
big
heart
his
sworn
pal
the
tiny
jumbo
was
well
nigh
distracted
at
the
thought
of
severing
their
two
knitted
hearts
but
father
was
dead
and
his
mother
was
too
poor
to
pay
for
his
schooling
so
they
gave
him
up
for
lost
not
without
aching
at
the
heart
and
even
a
little
dampness
at
the
eyelids
heady
was
the
first
to
leave
town
he
slipped
away
on
an
early
morning
train
without
telling
any
one
for
he
felt
very
much
ashamed
of
his
stubbornness
and
he
and
his
brother
shook
hands
with
each
other
as
nervously
as
two
a
few
days
later
the
five
sixths
of
the
dozen
that
were
booked
for
kingston
stood
on
the
crowded
platform
of
the
lakerim
bidding
to
all
the
parents
they
had
and
all
the
friends
all
of
them
had
paid
long
calls
on
their
best
girls
the
evening
before
and
exchanged
photographs
and
locks
of
hair
and
various
keepsakes
more
or
less
sentimental
and
altogether
useless
so
now
that
they
were
in
public
they
all
shook
hands
very
formally
tug
with
a
girl
several
years
older
than
he
pretty
with
the
beautiful
enid
quiz
with
the
fickle
cecily
brown
bashful
bobbles
with
the
bouncing
betsy
with
a
girl
who
had
as
many
freckles
as
had
had
imaginary
encounters
with
the
bandits
who
had
tried
to
steal
her
the
unwilling
sleepy
with
a
lively
young
woman
who
broke
his
heart
by
congratulating
him
on
being
able
to
go
to
kingston
tiny
jumbo
with
plump
carrie
shields
whom
he
had
once
fished
out
of
the
water
and
reddy
with
the
girl
over
whom
he
and
his
brother
had
had
their
bitterest
quarrels
and
who
could
not
for
the
life
of
her
tell
which
one
she
liked
the
better
illustration
stop
the
train
and
wait
for
me
i
going
to
kingston
too
but
there
was
one
very
little
girl
in
the
crowd
whose
greatest
sorrow
strangely
enough
was
the
fact
that
she
had
no
one
to
bid
to
since
her
dearest
friend
the
huge
was
not
to
go
to
kingston
just
as
the
engine
began
to
ring
its
warning
bell
and
the
conductor
to
wave
the
people
aboard
there
was
a
loud
clatter
of
hoofs
and
the
rickety
old
lakerim
carryall
came
dashing
up
drawn
by
the
lively
horses
had
once
saved
from
destroying
themselves
and
the
dozen
in
one
fell
swoop
down
a
steep
hill
the
carryall
lurched
up
to
the
station
came
to
a
sudden
stop
and
out
bounced
who
but
himself
loaded
down
with
bundles
and
yelling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
stop
the
train
and
wait
for
me
i
going
to
kingston
too
ii
there
was
just
time
to
dump
his
trunk
into
the
and
bundle
him
and
his
bundles
on
to
the
platform
before
the
train
steamed
away
and
the
eleven
lakerimmers
were
so
busy
waving
farewell
to
the
waving
and
farewelling
crowd
at
the
station
that
it
was
some
minutes
before
they
could
find
time
to
learn
how
came
to
be
among
them
when
he
explained
that
he
had
made
arrangements
to
work
his
way
through
the
academy
they
took
no
thought
for
the
hard
struggle
in
front
of
him
they
were
so
glad
to
have
him
along
jumbo
and
he
sat
with
their
arms
around
each
other
all
the
way
to
kingston
their
hearts
too
full
for
anything
but
an
occasional
hooray
the
journey
to
kingston
brought
no
adventures
with
it
except
that
history
of
course
had
lost
his
spectacles
and
his
ticket
and
had
to
borrow
money
of
pretty
to
keep
from
being
put
off
the
train
and
that
when
they
reached
kingston
they
came
near
forgetting
sleepy
entirely
for
he
had
curled
up
in
a
seat
and
was
reeling
off
slumber
at
a
faster
rate
than
the
train
reeled
off
miles
the
first
few
days
at
kingston
were
so
busily
filled
with
entrance
examinations
and
selection
of
rooms
and
the
harder
selection
of
and
other
furniture
that
the
dozen
saw
little
of
each
other
except
as
they
crunched
by
along
the
gravel
walks
of
the
campus
or
met
for
a
hasty
meal
in
the
this
by
the
way
was
managed
by
an
estimable
widow
named
mrs
slaughter
and
of
course
the
boys
called
it
the
a
name
not
so
far
from
the
truth
when
one
considers
the
way
large
tough
roasts
of
beef
and
tons
of
soggy
corned
beef
were
massacred
by
the
students
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
insert
here
a
little
snap
shot
of
kingston
academy
the
town
itself
was
a
old
village
that
claimed
a
thousand
inhabitants
but
could
never
have
mustered
that
number
without
counting
in
all
the
sleepy
horses
mules
cows
and
pet
dogs
that
roamed
the
streets
like
the
rest
of
the
inhabitants
the
chief
industry
of
the
people
of
kingston
seemed
to
be
that
of
selling
and
other
necessaries
of
life
to
the
boys
at
the
academy
the
grown
young
men
of
the
town
spent
their
lives
trying
to
get
away
to
some
other
cities
the
younger
youth
of
the
town
spent
their
lives
trying
to
interfere
with
the
pleasures
of
the
kingston
academicians
so
there
were
many
of
the
squabbles
and
it
was
well
for
the
health
of
the
kingston
academy
boys
that
they
rarely
went
around
town
except
in
groups
of
two
or
three
and
it
was
very
bad
for
the
health
of
any
of
the
town
fellows
if
they
happened
to
be
caught
within
the
academy
grounds
the
result
of
being
situated
in
a
village
which
was
neither
loved
nor
loving
did
not
make
life
at
the
academy
tame
but
quite
the
opposite
for
the
boys
were
forced
to
find
their
whole
entertainment
in
the
academy
life
and
in
one
another
and
the
campus
was
therefore
a
little
republic
in
itself
a
utopia
like
every
other
republic
it
had
its
cliques
and
its
struggles
its
victories
and
its
defeats
its
friendships
and
its
enmities
and
everything
else
that
makes
life
lively
and
lifelike
the
campus
was
beautiful
enough
and
large
enough
to
accommodate
its
citizens
handsomely
its
trees
were
many
and
tall
venerable
old
monarchs
with
foliage
like
tents
for
shade
and
comfort
to
any
little
groups
that
cared
to
lounge
upon
the
mossy
divans
beneath
the
grounds
were
spacious
enough
to
furnish
not
only
football
and
baseball
fields
and
but
meadows
where
wild
flowers
grew
in
the
spring
and
a
little
lake
where
the
ice
grew
in
the
winter
miles
away
just
enough
to
make
a
good
sabbath
day
journey
was
a
wonderful
region
called
the
ledges
where
glaciers
had
once
resided
and
left
huge
boulders
scratched
and
scarred
as
jumbo
put
it
it
seemed
from
the
chasms
and
caves
and
curious
distortions
of
stone
and
soil
that
nature
must
have
once
had
a
fit
most
of
the
buildings
of
the
academy
looked
nearly
old
enough
to
have
been
also
deposited
there
by
the
primeval
glaciers
but
they
were
huge
and
comfortable
and
so
many
colonies
of
boys
had
romped
and
ruminated
there
and
so
much
laughter
and
so
much
lore
had
soaked
into
the
old
walls
that
they
were
pleasanter
than
any
newer
and
more
gorgeous
architecture
could
possibly
be
they
were
homely
in
the
better
as
well
as
the
worse
sense
but
this
is
more
than
enough
description
and
you
must
imagine
for
yourselves
how
the
lakerim
eleven
often
as
they
thought
of
home
and
homesick
as
they
were
in
spite
of
themselves
now
and
then
rejoiced
in
being
thrown
on
their
own
resources
and
made
somewhat
independent
citizens
in
a
little
country
of
their
own
unwilling
to
make
selections
among
themselves
more
unwilling
to
select
from
the
other
students
the
foreigners
as
the
lakerimmers
called
them
they
drew
lots
for
one
another
and
the
lots
decided
that
they
should
room
together
thus
tug
and
punk
were
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
building
known
as
south
college
in
room
no
in
the
room
just
over
them
were
quiz
and
pretty
and
on
the
same
floor
at
the
back
of
the
building
were
bobbles
and
reddy
reddy
insisted
upon
this
room
because
it
had
a
third
bedroom
off
its
while
of
course
he
never
expected
to
see
heady
there
and
did
much
care
of
course
whether
he
came
or
not
still
a
fellow
never
can
tell
you
know
on
the
same
floor
were
and
jumbo
jumbo
did
not
stoop
to
flatter
by
pretending
that
he
would
not
have
preferred
for
his
but
was
working
his
way
through
and
the
principal
of
the
academy
had
offered
to
help
him
out
not
only
with
a
free
scholarship
but
with
a
free
room
as
well
in
middle
college
an
old
building
which
had
the
gymnasium
on
the
first
floor
the
chapel
on
the
second
and
in
the
loft
a
single
fixed
up
as
a
bedroom
the
lots
the
fellows
drew
seemed
to
be
in
a
joking
mood
when
they
selected
history
and
sleepy
for
the
hardest
student
and
the
softest
not
only
of
the
dozen
but
of
the
whole
academy
sleepy
had
been
too
lazy
to
pay
much
heed
when
the
diplomatic
history
had
suggested
their
choosing
room
no
for
theirs
and
he
assented
languidly
history
had
said
that
it
was
the
brightest
and
sunniest
room
in
the
building
and
if
there
was
one
thing
that
sleepy
loved
almost
better
than
baseball
it
was
a
good
snooze
in
the
sun
after
he
had
worked
hard
stowing
away
any
of
the
three
meals
his
heart
was
broken
however
when
he
learned
that
the
room
chosen
by
the
wily
history
was
on
the
top
floor
with
three
long
flights
to
climb
after
that
you
could
never
convince
him
that
thirteen
was
not
an
unlucky
number
the
lakerimmers
had
thus
managed
quietly
to
ensconce
themselves
all
except
in
one
building
and
it
was
just
as
well
perhaps
that
they
did
so
establish
themselves
in
a
stronghold
of
their
own
for
they
clung
together
so
steadfastly
that
there
was
soon
a
deal
of
jealousy
among
the
other
students
toward
them
and
all
the
factions
combined
together
to
try
to
keep
the
lakerimmers
from
cabbaging
any
of
the
good
things
of
academy
life
there
was
a
craze
of
skylarking
the
first
few
weeks
after
the
school
opened
almost
every
day
one
of
the
lakerimmers
would
come
back
from
his
classes
to
find
his
room
stacked
a
word
that
exactly
expresses
its
meaning
there
is
something
particularly
discouraging
in
going
to
your
room
late
in
the
evening
your
mind
made
up
to
a
comfortable
hour
of
reading
on
a
divan
covered
with
cushions
made
by
your
best
girls
only
to
find
the
divan
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
with
a
bureau
and
a
bookcase
stuck
on
top
of
it
a
few
chairs
and
a
pet
bulldog
tied
in
the
middle
of
the
and
a
mirror
and
a
bowl
of
water
so
fixed
on
the
top
of
the
heap
that
it
is
impossible
to
move
any
one
of
the
articles
without
cracking
the
or
dousing
yourself
with
the
water
the
lakerimmers
tried
retaliation
for
a
time
but
the
pleasure
of
stacking
another
man
room
was
not
half
so
great
as
the
misery
of
unstacking
one
own
room
and
they
finally
decided
to
keep
two
or
three
of
the
men
always
on
guard
in
the
building
there
was
a
rage
for
hazing
too
the
first
few
weeks
and
as
the
lakerimmers
were
all
new
men
in
the
academy
they
were
considered
particularly
good
candidates
for
various
degrees
of
torment
hazing
was
strictly
against
the
rules
of
the
academy
but
the
teachers
could
not
be
everywhere
at
once
and
had
something
to
do
besides
prowl
around
the
dark
corners
of
the
campus
at
all
hours
of
the
night
some
of
the
men
furiously
resisted
the
efforts
to
haze
them
but
when
they
once
learned
that
their
efforts
were
vain
and
had
perforce
to
submit
none
of
them
were
mean
enough
to
peach
on
their
tormentors
after
the
damage
was
done
the
lakerimmers
however
decided
to
resist
force
with
force
and
stuck
by
each
other
so
closely
and
barricaded
their
doors
so
firmly
at
night
when
they
must
necessarily
separate
that
time
went
on
without
any
of
them
being
subjected
to
any
other
indignities
than
the
guying
of
the
other
kingstonians
had
so
much
and
such
hard
work
to
do
after
school
hours
that
the
whole
academy
respected
him
too
much
to
attempt
to
haze
him
though
he
roomed
alone
in
the
old
middle
college
besides
his
size
was
such
that
nobody
cared
to
be
the
first
one
to
lay
hand
on
him
there
was
just
one
blot
on
the
happiness
of
the
dozen
at
kingston
tug
and
punk
and
jumbo
had
started
the
whole
migration
from
lakerim
because
they
had
been
invited
by
the
kingston
athletic
association
to
join
forces
with
the
academy
the
magnificent
game
of
football
these
three
men
had
played
in
the
last
two
years
had
been
the
cause
of
this
invitation
and
they
had
come
with
glowing
dreams
of
new
worlds
to
conquer
what
was
their
pain
and
disgust
to
find
that
the
captain
of
the
kingston
team
elected
before
they
came
had
decided
that
he
had
good
cause
for
jealousy
of
tug
and
had
decided
that
since
tug
would
probably
win
all
his
old
laurels
away
from
him
if
he
once
admitted
him
to
the
eleven
the
only
way
to
retain
those
laurels
was
to
keep
tug
off
the
team
when
the
lakerim
three
therefore
appeared
on
the
field
as
candidates
for
the
eleven
they
were
assigned
to
the
second
or
scrub
team
the
first
team
was
generally
called
the
varsity
though
of
course
it
only
represented
an
academy
the
lakerim
three
though
disappointed
at
first
determined
to
show
their
respect
for
discipline
and
to
earn
their
way
so
they
submitted
meekly
and
played
the
best
game
they
could
on
the
scrub
when
the
varsity
captain
clayton
by
name
criticized
their
playing
in
a
way
that
was
brutal
not
because
it
was
frank
but
because
it
was
unjust
they
swallowed
the
poison
as
quietly
as
they
could
and
went
back
into
the
game
determined
not
to
repeat
the
slip
that
had
brought
upon
them
such
a
deluge
of
abuse
it
soon
became
evident
however
from
the
way
clayton
neglected
the
mistakes
of
the
pets
of
his
own
eleven
and
his
constant
and
petty
with
the
three
lakerimmers
that
he
was
determined
to
keep
them
from
the
varsity
even
if
he
had
to
keep
players
on
the
team
and
even
if
he
imperiled
the
academy
chances
against
rival
elevens
when
this
unpleasant
truth
had
finally
soaked
into
their
minds
the
lakerimmers
grew
very
solemn
and
one
evening
when
the
whole
eleven
happened
to
be
in
room
no
and
when
the
hosts
tug
and
punk
were
particularly
sore
from
the
outrageous
language
used
against
them
in
the
practice
of
the
afternoon
punk
who
was
rather
easily
discouraged
spoke
up
i
guess
the
only
thing
for
us
to
do
fellows
is
to
pack
up
our
duds
and
go
back
home
there
no
chance
for
us
here
tug
who
was
feeling
rather
muggy
only
growled
not
on
your
life
i
had
rather
be
a
yellow
dog
than
a
quitter
then
he
relapsed
into
a
silence
that
reminded
history
of
achilles
in
his
tent
though
he
was
ungently
told
to
keep
still
when
he
tried
to
suggest
the
similarity
reddy
was
fairly
sizzling
with
rage
at
the
clayton
faction
and
sang
out
i
move
that
we
go
round
and
throw
a
few
rocks
through
windows
and
then
if
he
says
anything
punch
his
head
for
him
this
idea
seemed
to
please
the
majority
of
the
men
and
they
were
instantly
on
their
feet
and
rushing
out
of
the
door
to
execute
their
vengeance
on
the
tyrant
when
tug
thundered
out
for
them
to
come
back
i
got
a
better
idea
he
said
and
one
that
will
do
us
more
credit
i
tell
you
what
i
am
going
to
do
i
am
going
to
take
this
matter
into
my
own
hands
and
drill
that
scrub
team
myself
and
see
if
we
ca
teach
the
varsity
a
thing
or
two
i
believe
that
with
a
little
practice
and
a
little
good
sense
we
can
shove
off
the
earth
this
struck
the
fellows
as
the
proper
and
the
lakerim
method
of
doing
things
and
they
responded
with
a
cheer
iii
tug
persuaded
reddy
pretty
and
bobbles
who
had
not
been
trying
for
the
team
to
come
out
on
the
field
he
even
coaxed
the
busy
into
postponing
some
of
his
work
for
a
few
days
to
help
them
out
he
thus
had
almost
the
old
lakerim
eleven
at
his
command
and
that
very
night
in
that
very
room
they
concocted
and
practised
a
few
secret
tricks
and
a
few
surprises
for
clayton
who
was
neither
very
fertile
in
invention
nor
very
quick
to
understand
the
schemes
of
others
clayton
was
too
sure
of
his
own
position
and
power
to
pay
any
heed
to
the
storm
that
was
brewing
for
him
and
was
only
too
glad
to
see
more
lakerim
men
on
the
scrub
team
for
him
to
abuse
the
next
day
tug
persuaded
some
of
the
others
of
the
scrub
eleven
to
lay
off
for
a
few
days
and
he
also
persuaded
the
captain
of
the
scrub
team
to
give
him
command
for
a
week
then
he
took
his
new
eleven
seven
of
them
old
lakerim
veterans
out
on
the
field
and
worked
with
them
early
and
late
to
instil
into
the
heads
of
his
men
the
necessity
of
being
in
just
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
tug
drew
a
map
of
the
field
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
and
spread
it
on
his
then
he
took
checkers
and
set
them
in
array
like
two
football
teams
he
gathered
his
eleven
into
his
room
at
night
told
each
man
jack
of
them
which
checker
was
his
and
set
them
problems
to
work
out
suppose
i
give
the
signal
for
the
to
take
the
ball
around
the
he
would
say
and
ask
each
man
in
turn
where
would
you
go
then
the
backs
drew
their
checkers
up
to
position
as
interference
and
the
tackles
and
guards
showed
what
particular
enemies
they
were
to
bowl
over
many
ridiculous
mistakes
were
made
at
first
and
each
man
had
a
good
laugh
at
the
folly
of
each
of
the
others
for
some
play
that
left
a
big
hole
in
the
flying
protection
but
they
could
practise
at
night
and
worry
it
out
in
theory
while
their
legs
rested
till
the
next
day
practice
when
he
could
find
an
empty
at
an
idle
hour
professor
tug
as
they
soon
called
him
would
gather
his
class
about
him
and
work
out
the
same
problems
on
the
blackboards
each
man
being
compelled
to
draw
an
arrow
from
his
position
at
the
time
of
the
signal
to
his
proper
place
when
the
ball
was
in
play
the
game
now
became
a
true
science
and
the
scrub
took
it
up
with
a
new
zest
this
indoor
drill
made
it
easy
also
to
revive
a
trick
popular
at
yale
in
the
the
giving
of
one
signal
to
prepare
for
a
series
of
plays
then
tug
would
call
out
some
eloquent
gibberish
like
and
that
meant
that
on
the
first
down
the
was
to
come
in
on
the
run
and
take
the
ball
through
the
enemy
and
tackle
on
the
second
down
the
right
was
to
crisscross
with
the
left
and
on
the
third
down
the
was
to
scoot
round
the
the
beauty
of
this
old
scheme
was
that
it
caught
the
enemy
napping
while
he
was
lounging
and
waiting
for
the
loud
signal
the
ball
was
silently
put
in
play
before
he
was
ready
on
the
fatal
day
tug
found
that
the
scheme
was
well
worth
the
trouble
it
took
it
has
its
disadvantages
in
the
long
run
but
on
its
first
appearance
at
kingston
it
fairly
made
the
varsity
team
eyes
pop
with
amazement
tug
did
not
put
into
play
the
whole
strength
of
his
eleven
but
practised
cautiously
and
instructed
his
team
in
the
few
ruses
clayton
seemed
to
be
fond
of
he
was
looking
forward
to
the
occasion
when
a
complete
game
was
to
be
played
before
the
townspeople
between
the
varsity
and
the
scrub
and
clayton
was
looking
forward
to
this
same
day
and
promising
himself
a
great
triumph
when
the
academy
and
the
town
should
see
what
a
rattling
eleven
he
had
made
up
the
day
came
the
whole
academy
and
most
of
the
town
turned
out
and
filled
the
grand
stand
and
the
space
along
the
side
lines
it
was
to
be
the
first
full
game
of
the
season
on
the
academy
grounds
and
every
one
was
eager
to
renew
acquaintance
with
the
excitements
of
the
fall
before
you
have
doubtless
seen
and
read
about
more
football
games
than
enough
and
you
will
be
glad
to
skip
the
details
of
this
contest
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
do
more
than
suggest
how
clayton
was
simply
dumfounded
when
he
saw
his
first
long
caught
by
the
veteran
punk
and
carried
forward
with
express
speed
under
the
protection
of
tug
men
who
were
not
satisfied
with
merely
running
in
front
of
clayton
tacklers
but
bunted
into
them
and
dumped
them
over
with
a
vigor
and
covered
punk
from
attack
on
the
rear
and
carried
him
across
the
center
line
and
well
on
into
territory
before
clayton
realized
that
several
of
his
pets
were
mere
straw
men
and
dashed
violently
and
madly
into
and
through
interference
and
downed
him
on
the
line
how
the
spectators
looked
on
in
silent
amazement
at
this
unexpected
beginning
how
promptly
tug
men
were
lined
up
a
broad
swath
completely
opened
with
one
quick
gash
in
clayton
line
and
the
ball
shoved
through
and
within
five
yards
of
the
almost
before
clayton
knew
it
was
in
play
how
clayton
called
his
men
to
one
side
and
rebuked
them
and
told
them
just
what
to
do
and
found
to
his
disgust
that
when
they
had
done
it
it
was
just
the
wrong
thing
to
do
how
they
could
not
hold
the
line
against
the
fury
of
the
scrub
team
how
the
ball
was
jammed
across
the
line
right
under
the
and
clayton
head
well
whacked
against
one
of
those
same
posts
as
he
was
swept
off
his
feet
how
tug
men
on
the
line
were
taught
to
avoid
foolish
attempts
to
worry
their
opponents
and
taught
to
reserve
their
strength
for
the
supreme
moment
when
the
call
came
to
split
the
line
how
though
lighter
than
clayton
huge
pound
center
had
more
than
mere
bulk
to
commend
him
and
tipped
the
huge
baby
over
at
just
the
right
moment
how
tug
now
and
then
followed
a
series
of
honest
football
maneuvers
with
some
unexpected
trick
that
carried
the
ball
far
down
the
field
around
one
end
when
clayton
was
scrambling
after
it
in
the
wrong
place
how
tug
had
perfected
his
interference
until
the
man
carrying
the
ball
seemed
almost
as
safe
as
if
clayton
men
were
spaniards
and
he
were
in
the
turret
of
the
how
little
time
tug
men
lost
in
getting
away
after
the
ball
had
been
passed
to
them
how
little
they
depended
on
grand
stand
plays
by
the
individual
and
how
much
on
how
tug
men
went
through
clayton
interference
as
neatly
as
a
fox
through
a
hedge
how
they
resisted
clayton
mass
plays
as
firmly
as
harveyized
steel
how
clayton
fumed
and
fretted
and
slugged
and
fouled
and
threatened
his
men
and
called
them
off
to
hold
conferences
that
only
served
to
give
tug
men
a
chance
to
get
their
wind
after
some
violent
play
how
tug
was
everywhere
at
once
and
played
for
more
than
the
pleasure
of
winning
this
one
game
played
as
if
he
were
a
pair
of
twins
and
only
smiled
back
when
clayton
glared
at
him
how
punk
guarded
the
goal
from
the
longest
punts
the
varsity
could
make
and
how
he
kicked
the
goal
after
all
but
one
of
the
many
the
scrub
team
made
how
little
jumbo
as
passed
the
ball
with
never
a
fumble
and
never
a
bad
throw
how
when
it
came
back
to
his
hands
he
skimmed
almost
as
closely
and
as
silently
and
as
swiftly
over
the
ground
as
the
shadow
of
a
flying
bird
and
made
long
run
after
long
run
that
won
the
cheers
of
the
crowd
how
and
pretty
as
center
and
responded
at
just
the
right
moment
and
how
pretty
dodged
and
ran
with
the
alertness
he
had
learned
in
many
a
championship
tennis
tournament
and
how
reddy
as
left
flew
across
the
field
like
a
firebrand
or
hurled
himself
into
the
line
with
a
fury
that
seemed
to
have
no
regard
for
the
bones
or
flesh
of
himself
or
the
claytonians
how
iv
but
did
any
one
ever
read
such
a
string
of
hows
why
that
sentence
was
getting
to
be
longer
and
more
complicated
than
the
game
it
was
pretending
not
to
describe
so
here
an
end
o
with
the
plain
statement
that
the
game
like
that
sentence
came
finally
to
an
end
but
the
effects
of
the
contest
did
not
end
with
the
dying
out
of
the
cheers
with
which
the
victory
of
the
scrub
was
greeted
and
elevation
did
not
cease
when
he
had
been
caught
up
on
the
shoulders
of
the
crowd
and
carried
all
over
the
field
amid
the
wild
cheers
of
the
whole
academy
no
more
did
captain
clayton
chagrin
end
with
his
awakening
from
the
stupor
into
which
he
had
been
sent
by
the
surprisingly
good
form
of
the
scrub
clayton
felt
bitter
enough
at
the
exposure
of
his
bad
captaincy
but
a
still
greater
bitterness
awaited
him
and
a
still
greater
triumph
awaited
tug
for
the
athletic
association
put
their
heads
together
and
decided
to
have
their
little
say
the
result
was
published
in
the
kingston
weekly
and
tug
after
the
overwhelming
honor
of
being
interviewed
by
a
live
reporter
read
there
the
following
screaming
scrub
wipes
the
earth
with
varsity
kingston
football
team
meets
with
a
crushing
defeat
at
the
hands
of
the
second
eleven
score
to
varsity
outplayed
at
every
point
popular
opinion
forces
captain
clayton
to
resign
in
favor
of
tug
robinson
kingston
team
to
be
completely
reorganized
robinson
declares
that
favoritism
will
have
no
part
in
the
of
the
new
team
and
magnanimously
offers
clayton
a
position
on
the
new
eleven
there
is
no
need
telling
here
the
wild
emotions
in
the
hearts
of
clayton
and
his
faction
at
the
end
of
the
game
and
no
need
of
even
hinting
the
wilder
delight
of
the
lakerimmers
at
the
vindication
of
their
cause
the
whole
eleven
of
them
strolled
home
in
one
grand
embrace
and
used
their
jaws
more
for
talking
than
for
eating
when
they
reached
the
meal
at
the
and
after
supper
they
met
again
at
the
fence
and
sang
lakerim
songs
of
rejoicing
and
told
and
retold
to
each
other
the
different
features
of
the
game
which
they
all
knew
without
the
telling
so
much
praise
was
heaped
upon
tug
by
the
rest
of
the
academy
and
he
was
so
fêted
by
the
lakerimmers
that
he
finally
slipped
away
and
went
to
his
room
and
little
history
also
bade
them
good
night
on
his
old
excuse
of
having
to
study
it
was
very
dark
before
the
lakerimmers
had
talked
themselves
tired
then
they
voted
to
go
around
and
congratulate
tug
once
more
upon
his
victory
and
give
him
three
cheers
for
the
sake
of
auld
lang
syne
when
they
went
to
his
room
they
were
amazed
to
see
the
door
swinging
open
and
shut
in
the
breeze
they
noted
that
the
lock
was
torn
off
they
hurried
in
and
found
one
of
the
windows
broken
and
books
and
chairs
scattered
about
in
confusion
the
mantel
and
cloth
and
the
photographs
on
it
were
all
awry
it
was
evident
that
a
fierce
struggle
had
taken
place
in
the
room
the
nine
lakerimmers
stood
aghast
staring
at
each
other
in
stupefaction
reddy
was
the
first
to
find
tongue
and
he
cried
out
i
know
what
up
fellows
that
blamed
gang
of
hazers
has
got
him
now
there
was
an
excitement
indeed
punk
suggested
that
perhaps
he
might
be
in
history
room
and
bobbles
scaled
the
three
flights
three
steps
at
a
time
only
to
return
with
a
wild
look
and
declare
that
history
room
was
empty
his
lock
broken
and
his
student
lamp
smoking
plainly
the
hazing
committee
had
lost
no
time
in
seizing
its
first
opportunity
plainly
the
lakerimmers
must
lose
no
time
in
hurrying
to
the
rescue
up
and
after
men
cried
and
trying
to
remember
what
was
the
proper
thing
for
an
old
indian
scout
to
do
under
the
circumstances
he
started
off
on
a
dead
run
and
the
others
followed
him
into
the
night
v
tug
had
stood
the
praise
and
applause
of
his
and
especially
the
wild
flattery
of
the
dozen
who
were
almost
insanely
joyful
over
his
success
in
captaining
the
scrub
football
team
and
wiping
the
earth
up
with
the
varsity
until
he
was
as
sick
as
a
boy
that
has
overfed
on
candy
finally
he
had
slunk
away
rather
like
a
guilty
man
than
a
hero
and
started
for
his
room
once
he
had
left
the
crowd
and
was
alone
under
the
great
trees
darkly
beautiful
with
the
moonlight
he
felt
again
the
delicious
pride
of
his
victory
against
the
heavy
odds
and
the
conspiracy
of
his
deadly
rival
in
football
he
planned
in
his
imagination
the
various
steps
he
would
take
to
reorganize
the
varsity
eleven
to
which
it
was
evident
that
he
would
be
elected
captain
and
he
smacked
his
lips
over
the
prospects
of
glorious
battles
and
victories
in
the
games
in
which
he
and
his
team
would
represent
the
kingston
academy
against
the
other
academies
of
the
interscholastic
league
his
waking
dreams
came
true
in
good
season
too
for
under
his
inspiring
leadership
the
kingston
men
took
up
the
game
with
a
new
zest
gave
up
the
idea
that
individual
plays
won
games
and
learned
to
sink
their
ambitions
for
themselves
into
a
stronger
ambition
for
the
success
of
the
whole
team
and
they
played
so
brilliantly
and
so
faithfully
that
academy
after
academy
went
down
before
them
and
they
were
not
even
scored
against
until
they
met
the
most
formidable
rivals
of
all
the
greenville
academy
greenville
was
an
old
athletic
enemy
of
the
lakerim
club
and
tug
looked
forward
to
meeting
it
with
particular
delight
especially
as
the
championship
of
the
league
football
series
lay
between
greenville
and
kingston
i
have
only
time
and
room
enough
to
tell
you
that
when
the
final
contest
came
tug
sent
his
men
round
the
ends
so
scientifically
and
led
them
into
the
scrimmages
so
furiously
that
they
won
a
glorious
victory
of
to
but
this
is
getting
a
long
way
into
the
future
and
away
from
tug
on
his
walk
to
his
room
that
beautiful
evening
when
all
these
triumphs
were
still
in
the
clouds
and
he
had
only
one
victory
to
look
back
upon
tug
responsibility
had
been
great
that
afternoon
and
the
strain
of
coaxing
and
commanding
his
scrub
players
to
assault
and
defeat
the
heavier
eleven
opposed
to
them
had
worn
hard
on
his
muscles
and
nerves
when
he
got
to
his
room
he
was
too
tired
to
remember
that
he
had
forgotten
to
take
the
usual
precautions
of
locking
his
door
and
windows
or
even
of
drawing
the
curtains
he
did
not
stop
to
think
that
hazing
had
been
flourishing
about
the
academy
grounds
for
some
time
and
that
threats
had
been
made
against
any
of
the
lakerim
dozen
if
they
were
ever
caught
alone
he
could
just
keep
awake
long
enough
to
light
his
student
lamp
then
he
dropped
on
his
divan
and
buried
his
head
in
a
cushion
his
best
lakerim
girl
had
embroidered
for
him
in
a
fearful
and
wonderful
manner
and
was
soon
dozing
away
into
a
dreamland
where
the
whole
world
was
one
great
football
and
he
was
kicking
it
along
the
milky
way
scoring
a
every
fifty
years
a
little
later
history
poked
his
head
in
at
the
door
he
also
had
left
the
crowd
seated
on
the
fence
and
had
started
for
his
room
to
study
he
saw
tug
fast
asleep
and
let
him
lie
undisturbed
though
he
was
tempted
to
wake
him
up
and
say
that
tug
reminded
him
of
the
sleeping
beauty
before
taking
the
magic
kiss
but
he
thought
it
might
not
be
safe
and
went
on
up
to
his
room
whistling
very
much
off
the
key
tug
slept
on
as
soundly
as
the
mummy
of
rameses
but
suddenly
he
woke
with
a
start
he
had
a
confused
idea
that
he
had
heard
some
one
fumbling
at
his
window
his
sleepy
eyes
seemed
to
make
out
a
face
just
disappearing
from
sight
outside
he
dismissed
his
suspicions
as
the
manufactures
of
sleep
and
was
about
to
fall
back
again
on
the
comfortable
divan
when
he
heard
footsteps
outside
and
the
creak
of
his
he
rose
quickly
to
his
feet
a
masked
face
was
thrust
in
at
the
door
and
the
lips
smiled
maliciously
under
the
black
mask
and
a
pair
of
blacker
eyes
gleamed
through
it
tug
made
a
leap
for
the
door
to
shut
the
intruder
out
realizing
in
a
flash
that
the
hazers
had
truly
caught
him
napping
but
he
was
too
late
the
masked
face
was
followed
swiftly
into
the
room
by
the
body
that
belonged
to
it
and
by
other
faces
and
other
bodies
all
the
faces
masked
and
all
the
bodies
hidden
in
long
black
robes
tug
fell
back
a
step
and
said
with
all
the
calmness
he
could
muster
i
guess
you
fellows
are
in
the
wrong
room
nope
we
come
for
you
was
the
answer
of
the
first
masker
who
spoke
in
a
disguised
voice
tug
looked
as
resolutely
as
he
could
into
the
eyes
behind
the
mask
and
asked
rather
nervously
a
question
whose
answer
he
could
have
as
easily
given
himself
well
now
that
you
here
what
do
you
want
again
the
disguised
voice
came
deeply
from
the
leader
oh
we
just
want
to
have
a
little
fun
with
you
well
i
do
want
to
have
any
fun
with
you
parleyed
tug
trying
to
gain
time
oh
it
does
make
any
difference
whether
you
want
to
come
or
not
this
is
your
picnic
it
ours
was
the
cheery
response
of
the
first
ghost
and
the
other
black
crows
fairly
cawed
with
delight
still
tug
argued
what
right
have
you
men
got
to
come
into
my
room
without
being
invited
it
just
a
little
we
planned
well
i
not
feeling
like
entertaining
any
oh
that
does
make
any
difference
to
us
again
the
black
flock
flapped
its
wings
and
cawed
and
now
tug
as
usual
lost
his
temper
when
he
saw
they
were
making
a
guy
of
him
and
he
blurted
fiercely
get
out
of
here
all
of
you
then
the
crowd
laughed
uproariously
at
him
and
this
made
him
still
more
furious
and
though
they
were
ten
to
one
tug
flung
himself
at
them
without
fear
or
hesitation
when
five
of
them
fell
on
him
at
once
he
dragged
them
round
the
room
as
if
they
were
trying
to
down
him
but
the
odds
were
too
great
and
before
long
they
overpowered
him
and
tied
his
wrists
behind
him
not
without
difficulty
for
tug
had
the
slipperiness
of
an
eel
along
with
the
strength
of
a
young
shark
when
they
had
him
well
bound
and
his
legs
tethered
so
that
he
could
take
only
very
short
steps
they
lifted
him
to
his
feet
i
think
we
better
gag
him
said
the
leader
of
the
crows
and
he
produced
a
stout
handkerchief
but
tug
gave
him
one
contemptuous
look
and
remarked
do
you
suppose
i
a
i
not
going
to
call
for
help
there
was
something
in
his
tone
that
convinced
the
captain
of
the
crows
vi
a
detachment
was
now
sent
to
scurry
through
the
dormitory
and
see
if
it
could
find
any
other
lakerimmers
this
squad
finally
came
down
the
stairs
the
biggest
one
of
the
crows
carrying
little
history
under
his
arm
history
was
waving
his
arms
and
legs
about
as
if
he
were
a
tarantula
but
the
big
black
crow
held
him
tight
and
kept
one
hand
over
the
boy
mouth
so
that
he
could
not
scream
then
tug
began
to
struggle
furiously
again
and
to
resist
their
efforts
to
drag
him
out
of
the
room
he
could
easily
have
raised
a
cry
that
would
have
brought
a
professor
to
his
rescue
and
scattered
his
persecutors
like
sparrows
but
his
boyish
idea
of
honor
put
that
rescue
out
of
his
reach
and
he
fought
like
a
dumb
man
with
only
such
occasional
grunts
as
his
struggle
tore
from
him
he
might
have
been
fighting
them
yet
for
all
i
know
had
not
history
twisted
his
mouth
from
under
the
hand
of
his
captor
and
threatened
he
had
not
breath
enough
left
to
call
for
help
if
you
do
let
me
go
i
on
you
the
very
thought
of
this
smallness
horrified
tug
so
much
that
he
stopped
struggling
and
turned
his
head
to
implore
history
not
to
disgrace
lakerim
by
being
a
tattler
the
crows
saw
their
chance
and
while
tug
attention
was
occupied
one
of
them
threw
a
loosely
woven
sack
over
his
head
and
drew
it
down
about
his
neck
then
they
started
once
more
on
the
march
history
scratching
and
kicking
in
all
directions
and
doing
very
little
harm
while
tug
with
his
hands
tied
behind
him
and
his
head
first
in
a
noose
used
his
only
weapons
his
shoulders
with
the
fury
of
a
spanish
bull
and
before
they
got
him
through
the
door
he
had
nearly
disabled
three
of
his
assailants
making
one
of
them
bite
his
tongue
in
a
manner
most
uncomfortable
and
the
room
looked
as
if
a
young
cyclone
had
been
testing
its
muscles
there
the
crows
hustled
the
lakerimmers
out
without
any
unnecessary
tenderness
forgetting
to
close
the
door
after
them
out
of
the
hall
and
across
the
board
walk
on
to
the
soft
frosty
grass
where
the
sound
of
their
scuffling
feet
would
not
betray
them
they
jostled
their
way
tug
soon
decided
that
the
best
thing
for
him
to
do
was
to
reserve
his
strength
so
he
ceased
to
resist
and
followed
meekly
where
they
led
they
whirled
him
round
on
his
heel
several
times
to
confuse
him
as
to
the
direction
they
took
then
they
hurried
him
through
the
dark
woods
of
a
neglected
corner
of
the
campus
history
simply
refused
to
go
on
his
own
feet
and
they
had
to
carry
him
most
of
the
way
and
found
only
partial
revenge
in
pinching
his
spidery
legs
and
bumping
his
head
into
occasional
trees
the
two
boys
knew
when
they
left
the
campus
by
the
fact
that
they
were
bundled
and
boosted
over
a
stone
wall
and
across
a
road
history
as
he
stumbled
along
at
tug
side
at
length
came
to
himself
enough
to
be
reminded
of
the
way
the
ancient
romans
used
to
treat
such
captives
as
were
brought
back
in
triumph
by
their
generals
but
tug
did
not
care
to
hear
about
the
troubles
of
the
gauls
he
had
troubles
of
his
own
once
they
paused
and
heard
a
mysterious
whispering
among
the
crows
who
left
them
standing
alone
and
withdrew
a
little
distance
history
was
afraid
to
move
in
the
dark
for
fear
that
he
might
step
out
of
the
into
the
fire
but
tug
always
ready
to
take
even
the
most
desperate
chance
thought
he
would
make
a
bolt
for
it
he
put
one
foot
forward
as
a
starter
but
found
no
ground
in
front
of
him
he
felt
about
cautiously
with
his
toe
and
discovered
that
he
was
standing
at
the
brink
of
a
ledge
how
deep
the
ravine
in
front
of
him
was
he
could
only
imagine
and
in
spite
of
his
courage
he
shivered
at
the
thought
of
what
he
might
have
done
had
he
followed
his
first
impulse
and
made
a
dash
there
are
pleasanter
things
on
a
dark
night
than
standing
with
eyes
blindfolded
and
hands
bound
on
the
edge
of
an
unknown
embankment
as
he
waited
the
weakening
effect
of
the
struggle
and
the
mysterious
terrors
of
the
darkness
told
on
his
nerves
and
he
shivered
a
bit
in
spite
of
his
clenched
teeth
then
he
overheard
the
voices
of
the
crows
and
one
of
them
was
saying
aw
go
on
shove
him
over
another
protested
but
it
might
break
his
neck
and
it
sure
to
fracture
a
bone
or
two
well
what
of
it
he
nearly
broke
my
jaw
then
tug
heard
more
excited
whispering
and
what
sounded
like
a
struggle
and
suddenly
he
heard
some
one
rushing
toward
him
he
felt
a
sharp
blow
and
a
shove
from
behind
and
was
launched
over
the
brink
of
the
ledge
i
not
pretend
that
he
was
about
as
badly
scared
as
time
would
allow
but
there
was
barely
space
for
one
lightning
stroke
of
wild
regret
that
his
glad
athletic
days
were
over
and
he
was
to
be
at
least
a
cripple
if
he
lived
at
all
when
the
ground
rose
up
and
smote
him
much
quicker
even
than
he
had
expected
as
he
sprawled
awkwardly
and
realized
that
he
had
hardly
been
even
bruised
he
felt
a
sense
of
rage
at
himself
for
having
been
taken
in
by
the
old
hazing
joke
and
a
greater
rage
at
the
men
who
had
brought
on
him
what
was
to
him
the
greatest
disgrace
of
all
a
feeling
of
fear
he
had
just
time
to
make
up
his
mind
to
take
this
joke
out
of
the
hides
of
some
of
his
tormentors
if
it
took
him
all
winter
when
he
heard
above
him
the
sound
of
a
short
sharp
scuffle
with
history
who
was
pleading
for
dear
life
and
who
came
flying
over
the
ledge
with
a
shrill
scream
of
terror
and
plumped
on
the
ground
half
an
inch
from
tug
head
it
took
history
only
half
a
second
to
realize
that
he
was
not
dead
yet
and
he
was
so
glad
to
be
alive
again
as
he
thought
of
it
that
he
began
to
sniffle
from
pure
joy
the
crows
were
not
long
in
leaping
over
the
ledge
and
getting
tug
and
history
to
their
feet
then
they
took
up
the
march
again
staggering
under
their
laughter
and
howling
with
barbarous
glee
after
half
a
mile
more
of
hard
travel
the
prisoners
were
brought
through
a
dense
woods
into
a
clearing
where
their
party
was
greeted
by
the
voices
of
others
the
sack
over
tug
head
was
unbound
and
snatched
away
and
he
looked
about
him
to
see
a
dozen
more
black
crows
with
two
other
hapless
prisoners
seated
like
an
indian
about
a
blazing
lire
and
like
an
indian
pondering
tortures
for
their
unlucky
captives
in
the
fire
were
two
or
three
iron
pokers
glowing
the
sight
of
this
gave
the
final
blow
to
any
hope
that
might
have
remained
of
history
conducting
himself
with
dignity
when
he
and
tug
were
led
in
there
was
such
an
hilarious
celebration
over
the
two
lakerim
captives
as
the
indian
powwow
indulged
in
on
seeing
a
scouting
party
bring
in
daniel
boone
a
prisoner
as
tug
was
the
most
important
spoil
of
war
they
took
counsel
and
decided
that
he
should
be
given
the
position
of
honor
and
tortured
last
then
they
went
enthusiastically
to
work
making
life
miserable
for
the
two
captives
brought
in
previously
the
first
was
compelled
to
climb
a
tree
which
he
did
with
some
little
difficulty
seeing
that
while
half
of
them
pretended
to
boost
him
the
other
half
amused
themselves
by
grabbing
his
legs
and
pulling
him
back
three
inches
for
every
one
inch
he
climbed
like
the
frog
and
the
well
in
the
mathematical
problem
he
finally
gained
a
point
above
their
reach
however
and
seated
himself
in
the
branches
looking
about
as
happy
as
a
lone
wayfarer
treed
by
a
pack
of
wolves
then
they
commanded
him
to
bark
at
the
moon
and
threatened
him
with
all
sorts
of
penalties
if
he
disobeyed
so
he
yelped
and
gnarled
and
till
there
was
nothing
left
of
his
voice
but
a
sickly
wheeze
then
they
told
him
that
the
first
course
was
over
and
invited
him
to
return
to
earth
and
rest
up
for
the
second
so
he
came
sliddering
down
the
rough
bark
with
the
speed
of
greased
lightning
the
second
captive
was
a
great
fat
boy
who
had
been
a
promising
candidate
for
center
rush
on
the
football
team
until
appeared
on
the
scene
this
behemoth
was
compelled
to
seat
himself
on
a
small
inverted
saucer
and
row
for
dear
life
with
a
pair
of
toothpicks
the
crows
howled
with
glee
over
the
ludicrous
antics
of
the
fellow
and
set
him
such
a
pace
that
he
was
soon
a
perfect
waterfall
of
perspiration
and
was
crying
for
mercy
at
length
he
caught
a
crab
and
went
heels
over
head
backward
on
the
ground
and
they
left
him
to
recover
his
breath
and
his
temper
history
had
watched
these
proceedings
with
much
amusement
but
when
he
saw
the
hazers
coming
for
him
he
lost
sight
of
the
fun
of
the
situation
immediately
the
head
crow
now
towered
over
the
shivering
little
history
and
said
in
his
deepest
these
lakerim
cattle
are
too
fresh
they
must
be
branded
and
salted
a
little
then
he
fastened
a
handkerchief
over
history
eyes
and
growled
are
those
irons
hot
yet
your
majesty
came
the
answer
from
one
of
the
other
ravens
and
history
heard
the
clanking
of
the
pokers
as
they
were
drawn
from
the
fire
he
had
seen
before
that
they
were
and
now
they
were
brandished
before
his
very
nose
so
close
that
he
could
see
the
red
glow
through
the
cloth
over
his
eyes
and
could
feel
the
heat
in
the
air
close
to
his
cheek
where
shall
we
brand
the
wretch
your
honor
was
the
next
question
history
heard
the
poor
pygmy
was
too
much
frightened
to
move
and
he
almost
fainted
when
he
heard
the
first
crow
answer
gruffly
thrust
the
right
down
the
back
of
his
neck
and
give
him
a
good
long
mark
that
shall
last
him
the
rest
of
his
life
instantly
history
felt
a
bitter
stinging
pain
at
the
back
of
his
neck
a
pain
that
ran
like
fire
down
along
his
spine
and
he
gave
a
great
shriek
of
terror
and
almost
swooned
away
tug
eyes
were
not
blindfolded
and
he
had
seen
that
though
the
crows
had
waved
a
poker
before
history
nose
they
had
quickly
substituted
a
very
cold
rod
to
thrust
down
his
back
the
effect
on
the
nerves
of
the
blindfolded
boy
however
was
the
same
as
if
it
had
been
and
he
had
dropped
to
earth
like
a
flash
tug
though
he
knew
it
would
heighten
his
own
tortures
could
not
avoid
expressing
his
opinion
of
such
treatment
of
the
sensitive
history
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
more
disgusted
and
enraged
at
the
actual
pain
the
crows
had
given
their
captives
or
at
the
ridiculous
plights
they
had
put
them
in
but
he
did
know
that
he
regarded
the
whole
proceeding
as
a
terrible
outrage
a
disgrace
to
the
academy
and
ever
after
he
used
all
his
influence
against
the
barbarous
idea
of
hazing
but
now
he
commanded
as
though
he
were
master
of
the
situation
throw
some
of
that
water
on
the
boy
face
and
bring
him
to
and
while
they
hastened
to
follow
out
his
suggestion
he
poured
out
the
rage
in
his
soul
shame
on
you
you
big
cowards
for
torturing
that
poor
little
kid
you
a
nice
pack
of
heroes
you
are
only
twenty
to
one
but
pay
you
back
for
this
some
day
and
do
you
forget
it
and
if
untie
my
hands
i
take
you
one
at
a
time
now
i
guess
i
could
just
about
do
up
of
you
at
a
time
you
big
bullies
you
and
now
one
of
the
larger
crows
rushed
up
to
tug
and
drew
off
to
strike
him
in
the
face
but
tug
only
stared
back
into
the
eyes
with
a
fiercer
glare
in
his
own
and
cried
hit
me
my
hands
are
tied
now
it
a
good
chance
for
you
and
never
get
another
for
i
remember
the
cut
of
that
jaw
and
the
mole
on
your
cheek
in
spite
of
your
mask
and
you
wish
you
had
never
been
born
before
i
get
through
with
you
tug
rash
bravado
infuriated
the
crows
until
they
were
ready
for
any
violence
but
the
head
crow
interposed
and
pushed
aside
the
one
who
still
threatened
tug
he
said
laughingly
let
him
alone
boys
we
want
him
in
prime
condition
for
the
grand
final
torture
ceremonies
let
finish
up
the
others
then
they
laughed
and
went
back
to
the
first
two
wretches
and
made
life
miserable
for
them
to
the
end
of
their
short
wits
they
were
afraid
to
try
any
more
experiments
on
history
and
left
him
lying
by
the
fire
slowly
recovering
his
nerves
all
the
while
tug
had
remained
so
very
quiet
that
the
crows
detailed
to
watch
him
had
slightly
relaxed
their
vigilance
he
had
been
silently
working
at
the
cords
with
which
his
hands
were
tied
behind
his
back
and
by
much
straining
and
turning
and
torment
of
flesh
he
had
at
length
worked
his
right
hand
almost
out
of
the
rope
soon
he
saw
that
the
crows
were
about
to
begin
on
him
he
thought
the
whole
performance
an
outrage
on
the
dignity
of
an
american
citizen
and
he
gave
the
cords
one
last
fierce
jerk
that
wrung
his
right
hand
loose
though
it
left
not
a
little
of
the
skin
on
the
cords
and
the
first
crow
to
lay
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
thought
he
must
have
touched
a
live
wire
for
tug
hand
came
flashing
from
behind
his
back
and
struck
home
on
the
fellow
nose
then
tug
warmed
up
to
the
scrimmage
and
his
right
and
left
arms
flew
about
like
don
quixote
windmill
for
a
few
minutes
until
two
of
the
two
dozen
crows
lighted
on
his
back
and
pinioned
his
arms
down
and
bore
him
gradually
to
his
knees
just
as
the
rest
were
closing
in
to
crush
tug
into
mincemeat
perhaps
history
who
had
been
lying
neglected
on
the
ground
near
the
fire
rose
to
the
occasion
for
once
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
as
it
were
sat
down
suddenly
upon
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
rolled
over
swiftly
caught
up
the
two
pokers
which
had
been
restored
to
the
fire
after
they
had
been
used
to
frighten
him
and
before
he
could
be
prevented
thrust
the
handle
of
one
of
them
into
tug
grasp
and
rose
to
his
feet
brandishing
the
other
like
a
sword
tug
lost
no
time
in
adapting
himself
to
the
new
weapon
he
simply
waved
it
gently
about
and
described
a
bright
circle
in
the
air
over
his
head
and
his
enemies
fell
off
his
back
and
scattered
like
grasshoppers
tug
now
got
quickly
to
his
feet
and
he
and
history
shook
hands
with
their
left
hands
very
majestically
then
they
faced
about
and
stood
back
to
back
asking
the
crows
why
they
had
lost
interest
so
suddenly
and
cordially
inviting
them
to
return
and
finish
the
game
they
stood
thus
monarchs
of
all
they
surveyed
for
a
few
moments
but
dismay
replaced
their
joy
as
they
heard
the
words
of
the
first
crow
they
ca
get
back
to
their
rooms
before
their
pokers
grow
cold
and
it
is
only
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes
until
they
chill
anyway
so
all
that
we
have
to
do
is
to
wait
here
a
little
while
and
then
go
back
and
finish
up
our
work
and
perhaps
add
a
little
extra
on
account
of
this
last
piece
of
rambunctiousness
tug
saw
that
they
were
prisoners
indeed
but
intended
to
hold
the
fort
until
the
last
possible
moment
he
told
history
to
put
his
poker
back
in
the
fire
and
to
heat
it
up
again
while
he
stood
guard
with
his
own
to
this
stratagem
the
first
crow
responded
with
another
he
trumped
tug
ace
as
it
were
for
though
he
saw
that
the
fire
was
going
out
and
would
not
heat
the
pokers
much
longer
he
decided
not
to
wait
for
this
but
set
his
men
to
gathering
stones
and
sticks
to
pelt
the
two
luckless
lakerimmers
with
and
now
tug
saw
that
the
chances
of
escape
were
indeed
small
he
felt
that
he
could
make
a
dash
for
liberty
and
outrun
any
one
in
the
crowd
or
outfight
any
one
who
might
overtake
him
but
he
would
sooner
have
died
than
leave
history
who
could
neither
run
well
nor
fight
well
to
the
mercies
of
the
merciless
gang
that
surrounded
them
let
give
the
lakerim
yell
together
history
he
said
perhaps
the
fellows
have
missed
us
and
are
out
looking
for
us
and
will
come
to
our
rescue
so
he
and
history
filled
their
lungs
and
hurled
forth
into
the
air
the
old
lakerim
yell
or
as
much
of
it
as
two
could
manage
ray
ri
ro
row
roo
rah
the
crows
listened
in
amazement
to
the
of
the
two
lakerimmers
then
the
first
crow
who
had
irish
blood
in
his
veins
smiled
and
said
oho
i
see
what
they
are
up
to
they
calling
for
help
well
now
we
just
drown
out
their
yell
with
a
little
noise
of
our
own
and
so
when
tug
and
history
had
regained
breath
enough
to
begin
their
club
cry
again
the
whole
two
dozen
of
the
crows
broke
forth
into
a
horrible
hullabaloo
of
shrieks
and
howls
that
drowned
out
tug
and
history
voices
completely
but
raised
far
more
noise
than
they
could
ever
have
hoped
to
make
after
a
few
moments
of
thus
caterwauling
night
hideous
like
a
pack
of
coyotes
the
crows
began
to
close
in
on
the
lakerim
stronghold
and
stones
and
sticks
flew
around
the
two
in
a
shower
that
kept
them
busy
dodging
we
got
to
make
a
break
for
it
said
tug
under
his
breath
now
you
hang
on
to
me
and
i
hang
on
to
you
and
mind
how
your
lungs
ache
or
whether
you
have
any
breath
or
not
but
just
leg
it
for
home
he
had
locked
his
arm
through
history
and
made
a
leap
toward
the
circle
of
crows
just
as
a
heavy
stone
lighted
on
the
spot
where
they
had
made
their
stand
so
long
before
the
crows
knew
what
was
up
tug
and
history
were
upon
them
and
had
cut
a
path
through
the
ring
by
merely
brandishing
their
incandescent
pokers
and
had
disappeared
into
the
dark
of
the
woods
there
was
dire
confusion
among
the
crows
and
some
of
them
ran
every
which
way
and
lost
the
crowd
entirely
as
history
and
tug
vanished
into
the
thick
night
the
glowing
pokers
however
that
were
their
only
weapons
of
defense
were
also
their
chiefest
danger
and
a
pack
of
about
a
dozen
crows
soon
discovered
that
they
could
follow
the
runaways
by
the
gleam
of
the
rods
tug
realized
this
too
very
shortly
and
he
and
history
threw
the
pokers
away
tug
and
history
however
had
come
pretty
well
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
were
just
rushing
down
a
little
glade
that
would
lead
them
into
the
open
when
the
first
crow
yelled
for
some
of
his
men
to
take
a
short
cut
and
head
them
off
the
lakerimmers
then
their
breath
all
spent
and
their
hearts
burning
with
the
flight
which
tug
would
not
let
history
give
up
saw
themselves
headed
off
and
escape
no
longer
possible
tug
knew
that
history
would
be
useless
in
a
scrimmage
so
in
a
low
tone
he
bade
him
drop
under
a
deep
bush
they
were
just
passing
history
was
too
exhausted
to
object
even
to
being
left
alone
and
managed
to
sink
into
the
friendly
cover
of
the
bush
without
being
observed
and
tug
went
right
into
a
mob
of
them
crying
with
a
fine
defiance
the
old
yell
of
the
athletic
club
vii
the
nine
lakerimmers
who
had
set
forth
to
the
rescue
of
tug
and
history
had
no
more
clue
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
kidnapped
twain
than
some
broken
furniture
and
an
open
door
and
even
one
who
was
so
well
versed
in
detective
stories
as
had
to
admit
that
this
was
very
little
for
what
he
called
a
to
begin
work
on
there
had
been
no
snow
and
the
frost
had
hardened
the
ground
so
that
there
were
no
footprints
to
tell
the
way
the
crowd
of
hazers
had
gone
as
jumbo
said
it
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
after
dark
and
it
would
do
you
any
good
to
sit
down
in
this
haystack
either
the
only
thing
to
do
then
was
to
scour
the
campus
in
all
its
nooks
and
crannies
pausing
now
and
then
to
look
and
listen
hard
for
any
sign
or
sound
of
the
captives
but
each
man
heard
nothing
except
the
pounding
of
his
own
heart
and
the
wheezing
of
his
own
lungs
then
they
must
up
and
away
again
into
the
dark
they
had
scurried
hither
and
yon
and
yonder
and
thither
until
they
were
discouraged
when
just
as
they
were
crashing
through
some
thick
underbrush
stopped
suddenly
short
bumped
into
him
and
jumbo
tripped
over
but
commanded
them
to
be
silent
so
sharply
that
they
paused
where
they
had
fallen
and
listened
violently
then
they
heard
far
and
faint
in
the
distance
to
the
right
of
their
course
a
little
murmur
of
voices
just
barely
audible
quick
ear
made
out
the
difference
between
this
hubbub
and
the
other
quiet
sounds
of
the
night
that
dim
little
noise
his
breathless
fellows
could
just
hear
was
the
wild
hullabaloo
the
foolish
crows
had
set
up
to
drown
out
the
voices
of
tug
and
history
as
they
gave
the
lakerim
yell
ear
was
correct
enough
not
only
to
understand
the
noise
but
to
decide
the
direction
it
came
from
though
to
the
other
lakerimmers
it
came
from
nowhere
in
particular
and
everywhere
in
general
before
they
had
made
up
their
minds
just
how
puzzled
they
were
was
striking
off
in
a
new
direction
at
the
top
of
his
speed
and
was
well
over
the
stone
wall
before
they
could
get
up
steam
to
follow
him
across
the
road
and
through
the
fence
he
led
them
there
was
a
little
pause
while
jumbo
helped
the
lubberly
through
the
strands
that
had
laid
hold
of
his
big
frame
like
took
this
chance
to
vouchsafe
his
followers
just
one
bit
of
information
they
at
roden
knoll
he
puffed
roden
knoll
was
a
little
clearing
in
the
woods
that
marked
the
highest
point
of
land
in
the
state
though
it
was
approached
very
gradually
and
nothing
but
a
barometer
could
have
told
its
elevation
it
was
a
long
run
through
the
night
over
many
a
treacherous
bog
and
through
many
a
cluster
of
bushes
which
as
jumbo
said
had
and
there
was
many
a
stumble
and
jolt
and
many
a
short
stop
at
the
edge
of
a
sudden
embankment
one
of
these
pauses
that
brought
the
whole
nine
up
into
a
knot
was
the
little
where
tug
and
history
had
thought
they
were
being
shoved
over
the
precipice
of
a
grand
cañon
at
length
roden
knoll
was
reached
but
there
the
weary
lakerimmers
were
discouraged
to
find
nothing
but
a
smoldering
fire
and
the
signs
of
a
hard
straggle
we
too
late
it
all
over
sighed
pretty
thinking
sadly
of
the
mud
and
the
rips
and
tears
that
disfigured
his
usually
perfect
toilet
i
move
we
rest
a
bit
groaned
sleepy
seconding
his
own
motion
by
dropping
to
the
ground
shh
commanded
hear
that
instantly
they
were
all
in
motion
again
for
they
heard
the
noise
of
many
runners
crashing
through
the
thicket
soon
they
saw
a
shadowy
form
ahead
of
them
and
overtook
it
and
recognized
one
of
the
crows
they
gave
him
a
glance
and
then
shoved
him
to
one
side
with
little
gentleness
and
ran
on
two
or
three
of
the
crows
they
overtook
in
this
manner
but
spent
little
time
upon
them
they
were
bent
upon
a
rescue
not
upon
the
taking
of
prisoners
then
just
as
they
were
approaching
the
edge
of
the
woods
they
heard
a
cry
that
made
their
weary
blood
gallop
it
was
the
of
tug
making
his
last
charge
on
the
flock
of
crows
in
a
moment
they
had
reached
the
mass
of
humanity
that
was
writhing
over
him
and
they
began
to
tear
them
off
and
fling
them
back
upon
the
ground
with
fierce
rudeness
man
after
man
they
peeled
off
and
flung
back
till
they
got
down
to
one
fellow
with
his
knee
on
nose
that
nose
was
tug
and
they
soon
had
the
boy
on
his
feet
and
turned
to
continue
the
argument
with
the
crows
but
there
were
no
crows
to
argue
with
the
dozen
had
made
up
in
impetus
and
vim
what
it
lacked
in
numbers
and
the
crows
had
fled
as
if
from
an
army
a
few
black
ghosts
flying
for
their
lives
were
all
they
could
see
of
the
band
that
had
been
so
courageous
with
only
history
and
tug
to
take
care
of
so
the
ten
from
lakerim
gathered
together
and
while
beat
time
they
spent
what
little
breath
was
left
in
them
on
the
club
yell
it
sounded
more
like
a
chorus
of
bullfrogs
than
of
young
men
but
it
was
gladsome
enough
to
atone
for
its
lack
of
music
and
it
was
loud
enough
to
convince
history
that
it
was
safe
to
come
out
of
the
bushes
where
he
had
been
crouching
in
ghostly
terror
the
lakerimmers
were
inclined
to
laugh
at
history
for
his
fears
but
tug
told
them
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
seizing
the
pokers
there
would
have
been
a
different
story
to
tell
so
they
hugged
him
instead
of
laughing
at
him
and
clapped
him
on
the
back
such
a
vigorous
thump
that
history
thought
the
hazers
had
hold
of
him
again
now
they
took
up
their
way
back
to
the
academy
and
began
to
plot
a
dire
revenge
on
the
cowardly
crows
but
tug
said
i
move
we
let
the
matter
drop
they
the
ones
to
talk
now
of
getting
even
for
they
have
certainly
had
the
worst
of
it
it
be
just
as
well
to
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
them
though
and
it
is
very
important
for
us
to
stand
together
when
they
had
reached
the
dormitory
they
all
joined
in
straightening
up
and
rearranging
tug
room
before
they
went
to
their
sleep
i
am
afraid
the
lakerim
eleven
had
the
bad
taste
to
do
a
little
gloating
over
the
crows
their
wit
was
not
always
of
the
finest
but
they
enjoyed
it
themselves
though
little
the
crows
liked
it
and
it
kept
them
all
unusually
happy
for
many
days
all
except
reddy
he
showed
a
strange
inclination
to
mulp
a
portmanteau
word
that
jumbo
coined
out
of
mope
and
sulk
viii
to
see
the
hilarious
reddy
mulping
was
very
odd
about
the
only
subject
in
or
out
of
books
that
seemed
to
interest
him
in
the
slightest
degree
was
the
mention
of
the
name
of
his
twin
brother
heady
and
that
too
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
two
of
them
had
quarreled
and
bickered
so
much
that
their
despairing
parents
had
finally
sent
them
to
different
schools
but
now
reddy
seemed
to
be
inconsolable
grieving
for
the
other
half
of
his
twin
heart
finally
the
boy
blues
grew
so
blue
that
no
one
was
much
surprised
when
he
announced
his
desperate
determination
to
journey
to
the
town
where
heady
was
at
school
and
visit
him
reddy
got
permission
from
the
principal
to
leave
on
friday
night
and
return
on
monday
he
had
been
saving
up
his
for
many
a
dismal
week
and
now
he
went
about
borrowing
the
of
all
his
friends
one
friday
evening
then
after
class
hours
all
the
lakerimmers
went
in
a
body
down
to
the
to
bid
reddy
a
short
jumbo
felt
inclined
to
crack
a
few
jokes
upon
reddy
inconsistency
in
struggling
so
hard
to
get
away
from
his
brother
and
then
struggling
so
hard
to
go
back
to
him
but
tug
told
jumbo
that
the
subject
was
too
tender
for
any
of
his
flippancy
on
reaching
the
depot
they
found
that
reddy
train
was
half
an
hour
late
and
that
a
train
from
the
opposite
direction
would
get
in
first
so
they
all
stood
solemnly
around
and
waited
when
this
train
pulled
into
the
station
you
can
imagine
the
feelings
of
all
when
the
first
one
to
descend
was
was
heady
the
twins
stood
and
stared
at
each
other
like
tailors
dummies
for
a
moment
while
the
strangers
on
the
platform
and
on
the
train
wondered
if
they
were
seeing
double
then
reddy
and
heady
dropped
each
his
valise
and
made
a
spring
and
each
landed
on
the
other
neck
now
seized
heady
valise
and
jumbo
seized
reddy
and
then
they
all
set
off
together
the
reunited
twins
the
completed
dozen
for
the
campus
the
whole
twelve
felt
a
new
delight
in
the
reunion
and
realized
for
the
first
time
how
dear
the
dozen
was
the
twins
of
course
were
blissfulest
of
all
and
marched
at
the
head
of
the
column
with
their
arms
about
each
other
exchanging
news
and
olds
both
talking
at
once
and
each
understanding
perfectly
what
the
other
was
trying
to
say
thus
they
proceeded
glowing
with
mutual
affection
till
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
campus
when
the
others
saw
the
twins
suddenly
loose
their
hold
on
each
other
and
fall
to
hammer
and
tongs
over
some
quarrel
whose
beginning
the
rest
had
not
heard
jumbo
grinned
and
murmured
to
the
twins
are
themselves
again
but
hastened
to
separate
and
pacify
them
and
they
set
off
again
for
reddy
room
arm
in
arm
later
heady
arranged
with
his
parents
to
let
him
stay
at
kingston
for
the
rest
of
the
heady
had
not
been
back
among
his
old
cronies
long
before
they
had
him
up
in
a
corner
in
reddy
room
and
were
all
trying
at
the
same
time
to
tell
him
of
the
atrocious
behavior
of
the
crows
their
harsh
treatment
of
tug
and
history
the
magnificent
resistance
and
the
glorious
rescue
it
reminds
me
said
history
of
one
of
sir
william
scott
novels
with
moats
and
castles
and
swords
and
shields
and
all
sorts
of
beautiful
things
but
broke
in
scornfully
aw
that
old
scott
he
a
deader
it
reminds
me
of
one
of
those
new
detective
stories
with
clues
and
escapes
and
tug
is
like
ike
who
took
four
villyuns
two
in
each
hand
and
swung
them
around
his
head
till
they
got
so
dizzy
that
they
swounded
away
and
then
he
threw
one
of
through
a
winder
and
used
the
other
three
like
baseball
bats
to
knock
down
a
gang
of
desperate
ruffians
that
was
comin
to
the
rescue
oh
but
i
tell
you
it
was
great
me
bobbles
interrupted
it
more
like
one
of
funnimore
hooper
indian
stories
with
the
captives
tied
to
the
stake
and
tortured
and
scalluped
and
all
sorts
of
horrible
things
when
along
comes
old
and
picks
all
off
with
his
trusty
rifle
two
or
three
others
were
evidently
reminded
of
something
else
they
were
anxious
to
describe
but
heady
was
growing
impatient
and
very
wrathful
and
he
broke
in
well
while
you
fellows
are
all
being
reminded
of
so
many
things
i
like
to
ask
just
one
thing
and
that
is
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
nothing
at
all
said
history
and
thinking
of
his
unexpected
escape
from
his
terrible
adventure
he
added
quickly
i
think
we
did
mighty
well
to
get
out
of
it
alive
pooh
sniffed
heady
getting
madder
every
moment
well
tug
says
the
same
thing
drawled
sleepy
he
says
that
we
got
the
best
of
it
all
around
and
that
if
anybody
after
revenge
it
ought
to
be
the
crows
because
we
wiped
off
the
earth
bah
snapped
heady
it
is
enough
for
the
lakerim
athletic
club
to
get
out
of
a
thing
even
and
call
quits
leastways
that
was
the
pollersy
when
i
used
to
be
with
you
this
spirit
of
revolt
from
the
calm
advice
of
tug
seemed
to
be
catching
and
the
other
lakerimmers
were
becoming
much
excited
tug
made
a
speech
trying
to
calm
the
growing
rage
and
he
was
supported
by
history
who
tried
to
bring
up
some
historical
parallels
but
was
ordered
off
the
floor
by
the
others
tug
plan
which
was
seconded
by
history
from
motives
of
timidity
was
thirded
by
sleepy
from
motives
of
laziness
but
heady
leaped
to
his
foot
and
delivered
a
wild
plea
for
war
such
another
harangue
as
he
had
delivered
during
the
famous
at
the
hawk
nest
he
favored
a
sharp
and
speedy
retaliation
well
how
are
you
going
to
retaliate
said
tug
who
saw
his
policy
losing
all
its
force
and
who
began
to
grow
just
a
bit
eager
himself
to
give
the
crows
a
good
lesson
still
he
repeated
when
heady
only
looked
puzzled
and
gave
no
answer
how
are
you
going
to
retaliate
i
say
a
chance
will
come
said
heady
solemnly
and
reddy
who
had
been
burning
up
with
patriotic
zeal
for
the
glory
of
lakerim
was
so
proud
of
his
brother
success
in
stirring
up
a
warlike
spirit
that
he
moved
over
and
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
and
put
his
arms
around
him
and
they
never
quarreled
again
till
after
supper
but
the
chance
came
sooner
than
any
of
them
expected
ix
for
quiz
whose
curiosity
threatened
to
be
the
death
of
him
some
day
and
who
was
always
snooping
around
learned
not
many
days
later
that
the
crows
were
planning
to
give
a
great
banquet
in
a
room
over
the
only
restaurant
in
the
village
this
feast
had
been
intended
as
a
grand
finale
to
the
season
of
hazing
and
it
was
to
be
paid
for
by
the
poor
wretches
who
had
been
given
the
pleasure
of
being
hazed
and
taxed
a
dollar
apiece
for
the
privilege
strange
to
say
the
two
lakerim
men
whom
the
crows
had
tried
to
haze
were
neither
invited
to
pay
the
tax
nor
to
be
present
at
the
banquet
in
fact
the
unkind
behavior
of
the
lakerimmers
had
hurt
the
feelings
of
the
crows
very
badly
and
cast
a
gloom
over
the
whole
idea
of
the
banquet
as
soon
as
quiz
learned
in
a
roundabout
way
where
and
when
the
feast
was
to
be
held
he
came
rushing
into
tug
room
where
the
dozen
had
gathered
saturday
evening
after
a
long
day
spent
in
skating
on
the
first
heavy
ice
of
the
winter
quiz
crashed
through
the
door
and
smashed
it
shut
behind
him
and
yelled
i
got
it
i
got
it
with
such
zeal
that
sleepy
who
was
taking
a
little
doze
in
a
tilted
chair
went
over
backward
into
a
corner
and
had
to
be
pulled
out
by
the
heels
history
spoke
up
as
usual
with
one
of
his
eternal
memories
and
piped
out
you
remind
me
quiz
of
the
day
when
archimeter
jumped
out
of
his
and
ran
around
yelling
euraker
but
heady
shouted
somebody
stuff
a
down
history
mouth
until
we
learn
what
it
is
that
quiz
has
got
or
what
it
is
that
got
quiz
added
jumbo
when
history
had
been
upset
and
sleepy
set
up
quiz
who
had
run
several
blocks
with
his
news
found
breath
to
gasp
the
crows
are
going
to
have
a
banquet
then
he
flopped
over
on
the
couch
and
proceeded
to
pant
like
a
the
rest
of
the
dozen
stared
at
quiz
a
moment
then
passed
a
look
around
as
if
they
thought
that
either
quiz
was
out
of
his
head
or
they
were
then
they
all
exclaimed
in
chorus
well
what
of
it
and
jumbo
added
sarcastically
it
be
a
nice
day
if
it
does
rain
quiz
was
a
long
time
getting
his
breath
and
opening
his
eyes
then
it
was
his
turn
to
look
around
in
amazement
and
to
exclaim
what
of
it
what
of
it
why
you
numskulls
do
you
see
it
just
the
chance
you
wanted
for
revenge
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
the
others
do
you
mean
that
we
should
go
down
and
eat
the
banquet
for
queried
sleepy
whose
first
thought
was
always
either
for
a
round
sleep
or
a
square
meal
i
had
thought
of
that
said
quiz
that
would
be
a
good
idea
too
what
i
had
in
my
mind
was
doing
what
they
do
in
the
big
colleges
sometimes
kidnap
the
president
of
the
crowd
so
that
he
ca
go
to
the
dinner
great
head
great
scheme
the
others
exclaimed
and
they
jumped
to
their
feet
and
indulged
in
a
that
shook
the
whole
building
when
they
had
done
with
this
jollification
tug
who
objected
to
doing
things
by
halves
asked
why
not
kidnap
the
whole
kit
and
boodle
of
them
then
there
was
another
but
they
all
stopped
suddenly
and
quiz
expressed
the
sentiment
of
all
of
them
when
he
said
but
how
are
we
going
to
do
it
then
they
all
put
their
heads
together
for
a
long
and
serious
debate
the
result
of
which
was
a
plan
that
seemed
to
promise
success
the
banquet
was
to
be
held
on
the
next
friday
night
at
night
and
the
dozen
had
nearly
a
week
for
perfecting
their
plot
suggested
the
first
plan
that
looked
feasible
for
taking
care
of
the
whole
crowd
of
the
crows
about
two
dozen
in
number
the
chapel
over
which
had
his
room
had
a
large
as
well
knew
since
it
was
one
of
his
duties
to
ring
the
bell
on
all
the
many
occasions
when
it
was
to
be
rung
in
this
cupola
there
was
a
loft
of
good
size
it
was
reached
by
a
heavy
ladder
which
could
be
removed
with
some
difficulty
under
the
chapel
there
was
a
large
cellar
which
seemed
never
to
have
been
used
for
any
particular
purpose
though
it
was
divided
into
a
number
of
compartments
separated
by
the
stone
walls
of
the
foundation
or
by
heavy
boarding
a
few
hundred
old
books
from
the
library
were
about
its
only
contents
the
only
occupant
of
the
chapel
except
at
morning
prayers
and
on
sundays
was
the
gymnasium
on
the
ground
floor
was
not
lighted
up
after
dark
and
so
the
building
was
completely
deserted
every
evening
some
unusual
scheme
must
be
devised
to
enable
twelve
men
to
take
care
of
fortunately
it
happened
that
half
a
dozen
of
the
took
the
train
for
their
homes
in
neighboring
towns
where
they
went
to
spend
saturday
and
sunday
with
their
parents
this
reduced
the
number
to
eighteen
friday
evening
a
number
of
the
crows
appeared
at
the
slaughterhouse
though
there
was
to
be
a
banquet
at
eight
with
true
boyhood
appetite
they
felt
that
a
bun
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
future
and
besides
what
boy
would
refuse
to
take
care
of
two
meals
where
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
only
one
it
would
be
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
now
who
as
you
know
was
paying
his
way
through
the
academy
earned
his
board
by
waiting
on
the
table
he
had
an
excellent
chance
therefore
for
tucking
under
the
plates
of
all
the
crows
a
note
which
read
the
crows
will
meet
at
the
gymnasium
after
dark
and
go
to
moore
resteront
in
a
body
keep
this
conphedential
to
half
a
dozen
of
the
notes
these
words
were
added
you
are
wanted
at
the
gymnasium
at
a
to
to
serve
on
a
cummitty
be
there
sharp
the
crows
naturally
did
not
know
the
handwriting
of
every
one
of
their
number
and
did
not
recognize
that
the
notes
were
of
manufacture
they
were
a
little
mystified
but
suspected
nothing
the
dozen
gathered
in
full
force
at
the
gymnasium
as
soon
after
supper
as
they
could
without
attracting
attention
who
had
the
keys
of
the
building
then
posted
a
strong
guard
at
the
heavy
door
and
explained
and
rehearsed
his
plan
in
detail
at
a
quarter
of
seven
the
six
who
had
been
requested
to
serve
on
the
cummitty
came
in
a
body
and
finding
the
door
of
the
gymnasium
fastened
knocked
gently
they
heard
a
low
voice
from
the
inside
ask
who
there
and
they
gave
their
names
do
you
all
belong
to
the
crows
of
course
they
answered
yes
they
were
then
admitted
in
single
file
into
the
vestibule
which
was
absolutely
dark
as
each
one
stepped
in
a
hand
was
laid
on
each
arm
and
he
was
requested
in
a
whisper
to
come
this
way
between
his
two
escorts
he
stumbled
along
through
the
dark
until
suddenly
the
door
was
heard
to
close
and
the
key
to
snap
in
the
lock
then
immediately
his
mouth
was
covered
with
a
borrowed
from
the
gymnasium
his
feet
were
kicked
out
from
under
him
and
before
he
knew
it
his
two
courteous
escorts
had
their
knees
in
the
small
of
his
back
and
were
tying
him
hand
and
foot
one
or
two
of
the
crows
put
up
a
good
fight
and
managed
to
squirm
away
from
the
gagging
and
let
out
a
yelp
but
the
heavy
door
of
the
gymnasium
kept
the
secret
mum
and
there
was
something
so
surprising
about
the
ambuscade
in
the
dark
that
the
dozen
soon
had
the
securely
gagged
and
fettered
then
they
were
toted
like
up
the
stairs
of
the
chapel
and
on
up
and
up
into
the
loft
and
into
the
there
they
were
laid
out
on
the
floor
and
their
angry
eyes
discovered
that
they
were
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
reddy
and
heady
the
only
light
was
a
lantern
and
reddy
and
heady
each
carried
an
indian
club
also
borrowed
from
the
gymnasium
and
with
this
they
promised
to
tap
any
of
the
crows
on
the
head
if
he
made
the
slightest
disturbance
the
ten
other
lakerimmers
hastened
down
to
the
ground
floor
again
just
in
time
to
welcome
the
earliest
of
the
crows
to
arrive
this
was
a
fellow
who
had
always
believed
up
to
this
time
in
being
punctual
but
he
was
very
much
discouraged
in
this
excellent
habit
by
the
reception
he
got
at
the
gymnasium
for
on
saying
in
answer
to
the
voice
behind
the
door
that
he
had
the
honor
of
being
a
crow
he
was
ushered
in
and
treated
to
the
same
hospitality
that
had
been
meted
out
to
the
committee
of
six
the
wisdom
of
using
the
words
after
dark
on
the
forged
invitation
was
soon
made
evident
because
the
crows
did
not
come
all
at
once
but
gradually
by
ones
and
twos
every
few
minutes
between
seven
and
in
this
way
eleven
more
of
the
crows
were
taken
in
these
were
bundled
down
into
the
dark
cellar
and
stowed
away
in
groups
of
three
or
four
in
three
of
the
compartments
of
the
cellar
each
with
a
guard
armed
with
a
lantern
and
an
indian
club
by
a
quarter
to
eight
the
lakerimmers
believed
that
they
had
accounted
for
all
of
the
crows
except
the
president
macmanus
six
had
left
town
six
were
stowed
aloft
in
the
cupola
and
eleven
were
as
the
sailor
expressed
it
below
hatches
five
of
the
dozen
were
posted
as
guards
and
that
left
seven
to
go
out
upon
the
and
bring
in
the
chief
of
the
ravens
he
had
felt
his
dignity
too
great
to
permit
him
to
take
two
meals
in
one
evening
besides
he
was
very
solemnly
engaged
in
preparing
a
speech
to
deliver
at
the
banquet
and
his
task
was
very
difficult
since
he
had
to
make
a
great
splurge
about
the
glories
of
the
campaign
without
reminding
every
one
of
the
inglorious
result
of
the
attempt
to
haze
the
dozen
no
note
had
been
sent
to
him
and
it
seemed
necessary
to
concoct
some
scheme
to
decoy
him
from
his
room
because
any
attempt
to
drag
him
out
would
probably
bring
one
of
the
professors
down
upon
the
scene
tug
had
an
idea
and
leaving
three
of
the
seven
to
guard
the
door
he
took
the
other
three
and
hurried
to
the
dormitory
where
macmanus
roomed
and
threw
pebbles
against
his
window
the
chief
crow
soon
stuck
his
head
out
and
peered
down
into
the
dark
asking
what
was
the
matter
a
voice
that
he
did
not
recognize
or
suspect
came
out
of
the
blackness
to
inform
him
that
some
of
the
crows
were
in
trouble
at
the
gymnasium
and
he
must
come
at
once
after
waiting
a
moment
they
saw
his
light
go
out
and
heard
his
feet
upon
the
stairs
for
he
had
lost
no
time
in
stuffing
into
his
pocket
the
notes
for
his
address
at
the
banquet
and
flying
to
the
rescue
of
the
captive
banqueters
as
soon
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
door
of
the
dormitory
history
knit
muffler
was
wrapped
around
his
mouth
and
he
was
seized
and
hustled
along
toward
the
gymnasium
tug
felt
a
strong
desire
to
inflict
punishment
then
and
there
upon
the
man
who
had
tortured
him
when
he
was
helpless
but
that
was
not
according
to
the
lakerim
code
another
idea
however
which
was
quite
as
cruel
but
had
the
saving
grace
of
fun
suggested
itself
to
him
and
he
said
to
the
others
when
they
had
reached
the
gymnasium
i
tell
you
what
fellows
what
said
the
reunited
seven
in
one
breath
instead
of
putting
macmanus
with
the
rest
of
let
take
him
along
and
make
him
look
on
while
we
eat
the
crows
banquet
make
him
crow
himself
you
mean
suggested
jumbo
the
idea
appealed
strongly
to
the
lakerimmers
who
after
all
were
human
and
could
help
now
and
then
enjoying
the
misery
of
those
who
had
made
them
miserable
while
macmanus
was
securely
held
by
two
of
the
dozen
and
tug
went
to
the
cupola
to
summon
the
twins
the
knots
with
which
the
cummitty
were
tied
were
carefully
looked
to
and
strengthened
and
then
the
lakerimmers
withdrew
from
the
cupola
taking
the
lantern
with
them
dragging
a
heavy
over
their
heads
as
they
descended
the
ladder
and
then
taking
the
ladder
away
and
laying
it
on
the
floor
they
hurried
down
the
stairs
then
and
went
to
the
cellar
looking
alive
again
to
the
fetters
of
the
crows
and
closing
and
barring
the
heavy
wooden
doors
between
the
compartments
as
securely
as
they
could
they
came
up
the
stairs
and
put
down
and
bolted
the
cellar
door
and
moved
upon
it
with
great
difficulty
the
parallel
bars
with
their
iron
supports
from
the
gymnasium
and
several
as
well
as
the
heavy
reddy
and
heady
were
in
favor
also
of
blocking
up
the
narrow
little
windows
set
high
in
the
walls
of
the
cellar
well
over
the
head
of
the
tallest
of
the
crows
but
tug
said
that
these
windows
were
necessary
for
ventilation
and
history
was
reminded
of
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
so
it
was
decided
to
leave
the
windows
open
for
the
sake
of
the
air
even
if
it
did
give
the
crows
a
loophole
of
possible
escape
there
no
fun
in
an
affair
of
this
kind
if
the
other
side
even
a
chance
said
tug
and
this
appealed
to
the
lakerim
theory
of
sport
x
so
they
all
left
the
gymnasium
with
its
prisoners
and
locked
the
door
firmly
behind
him
then
they
went
at
a
for
moore
restaurant
and
the
waiting
banquet
which
they
suspected
was
by
this
time
growing
cold
when
macmanus
left
his
room
he
had
thrown
on
a
long
ulster
overcoat
with
a
very
high
collar
when
this
was
turned
up
about
his
ears
it
completely
hid
the
gag
around
his
mouth
and
tug
and
locked
arms
with
him
and
hurried
him
along
the
poorly
lighted
streets
of
kingston
without
fear
of
detection
from
any
macmanus
dragged
his
feet
and
refused
to
go
for
a
time
till
tug
and
hauled
him
over
such
rough
spots
that
he
preferred
to
walk
then
without
warning
when
they
were
crossing
a
slippery
place
he
pushed
his
feet
in
opposite
directions
and
knocked
and
tug
feet
out
from
under
them
but
inasmuch
as
all
three
of
them
fell
in
a
heap
with
him
at
the
bottom
he
decided
that
this
was
a
poor
policy
the
dozen
were
soon
at
moore
restaurant
and
there
at
the
door
they
found
waiting
one
of
the
crows
whom
they
had
forgotten
to
take
into
account
he
was
the
fat
boy
whom
tug
and
history
had
seen
hazed
just
before
their
turn
came
on
the
eventful
night
at
roden
knoll
having
been
hazed
and
having
been
taxed
this
boy
who
was
known
as
fatty
warner
was
entitled
to
banquet
with
the
crows
but
he
had
been
invited
out
to
a
bigger
supper
than
he
could
get
at
the
and
so
he
did
not
receive
his
note
and
escaped
the
fate
of
the
crows
who
had
been
put
in
cold
storage
in
the
gymnasium
and
bobbles
however
took
him
to
one
side
and
told
him
that
they
were
afraid
they
would
have
to
tie
him
up
and
put
him
in
a
corner
with
macmanus
but
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
at
the
thought
of
sitting
and
looking
at
a
feast
in
which
he
could
not
take
part
and
he
reminded
the
lakerimmers
that
he
had
had
no
share
in
the
attack
on
tug
and
history
and
had
done
nothing
to
interfere
with
their
escape
from
roden
knoll
and
besides
he
had
been
compelled
to
pay
out
his
last
cent
of
to
the
crows
for
this
banquet
so
the
lakerimmers
decided
to
invite
him
to
join
them
in
eating
the
feast
of
the
enemy
moore
the
proprietor
of
the
village
restaurant
had
a
very
bad
memory
for
faces
and
when
the
lakerimmers
came
into
the
room
where
the
table
was
spread
and
told
him
to
hurry
up
with
the
banquet
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
ask
for
a
certificate
of
character
from
the
guests
he
was
surprised
however
that
there
were
only
twelve
men
where
he
had
provided
for
eighteen
or
more
but
jumbo
said
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
the
rest
of
them
could
come
so
we
eat
their
share
the
lakerimmers
grinned
at
this
moore
suspected
that
there
was
some
joke
which
he
could
not
understand
but
the
ways
of
the
academy
boys
were
always
past
his
comprehension
so
he
and
the
waiters
came
bustling
in
with
the
first
course
of
just
such
a
banquet
as
would
please
a
crowd
of
academicians
and
would
give
an
older
person
a
for
six
weeks
besides
the
wise
moore
knew
the
little
habit
students
have
of
postponing
the
payment
of
their
bills
and
he
had
insisted
upon
being
paid
in
advance
poor
macmanus
suddenly
remembered
how
he
had
doled
out
the
funds
of
the
crows
for
this
very
spread
and
he
almost
sobbed
as
he
thought
of
the
hard
time
he
had
spent
in
collecting
the
money
and
preparing
the
menu
and
all
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
hated
lakerimmers
who
had
already
spoiled
the
final
hazing
of
the
year
and
were
now
giggling
and
gobbling
the
precious
banquet
provided
at
such
expense
moore
wondered
at
the
presence
of
such
a
guest
at
the
feast
and
wondered
why
he
insisted
on
abstaining
from
the
monstrous
delicacies
that
made
the
tables
groan
but
he
reasoned
that
it
was
none
of
his
affair
and
asked
no
questions
before
they
had
eaten
much
the
lakerimmers
grew
as
uncomfortable
over
the
torment
they
were
inflicting
on
poor
macmanus
as
the
poor
macmanus
was
himself
and
tug
explained
to
him
in
a
low
voice
that
if
he
would
promise
on
his
solemn
honor
not
to
make
any
disturbance
they
would
be
glad
to
have
him
as
a
guest
instead
of
a
prisoner
macmanus
objected
bitterly
for
a
long
time
but
the
enticing
odor
drove
him
almost
crazy
and
the
sight
of
the
renegade
fat
boy
who
was
fairly
making
a
cupboard
of
himself
finally
convinced
the
president
that
it
was
better
to
take
his
ill
fortune
with
a
good
grace
so
he
nodded
assent
to
the
promises
tug
exacted
of
him
his
muffler
and
overcoat
were
removed
and
he
was
invited
to
make
himself
at
home
and
his
misery
was
promptly
forgotten
in
the
rattle
of
dishes
and
the
clatter
of
laughter
and
song
with
which
the
dozen
reveled
in
the
feast
of
its
ancient
enemies
the
delight
of
the
lakerimmers
in
the
banquet
was
no
greater
than
the
misery
of
the
crows
whose
wings
had
been
clipped
and
who
had
been
left
to
flop
about
in
the
dark
nooks
of
the
chapel
the
feast
of
the
dozen
had
just
begun
when
two
of
the
crows
in
the
cupola
and
two
others
in
the
cellar
bethought
themselves
to
roll
close
to
each
other
back
to
back
and
untie
the
knots
around
each
other
wrists
they
were
soon
free
and
quickly
had
their
fellows
liberated
and
the
gags
all
removed
but
the
liberty
of
hands
and
feet
and
tongues
though
it
left
them
free
to
express
their
rage
still
left
them
as
far
as
ever
from
the
banquet
which
as
they
soon
suspected
was
disappearing
rapidly
under
the
teeth
of
the
lakerimmers
they
groped
around
in
the
darkness
and
finally
one
of
the
men
in
the
cupola
found
a
little
round
window
through
which
he
could
put
his
head
and
yell
for
help
his
cry
was
soon
answered
by
another
that
seemed
to
come
faintly
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
xi
the
cry
which
the
six
crows
in
the
cupola
heard
coming
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
was
raised
by
the
eleven
crows
in
the
cellar
by
dint
of
much
yelling
the
two
flocks
made
their
misery
known
to
each
other
the
trouble
with
the
cellar
party
was
that
it
could
not
get
up
the
trouble
with
the
cupola
crowd
was
that
it
could
not
get
down
and
they
seemed
to
be
too
far
apart
to
be
of
much
help
to
each
other
for
the
cupola
crows
had
lost
little
time
in
lifting
the
of
the
belfry
and
finding
that
the
ladder
was
gone
and
none
of
them
was
hardy
or
foolhardy
enough
to
risk
the
drop
into
the
uncertain
dark
so
there
they
waited
in
the
cellar
crows
when
they
had
released
each
other
bonds
and
groped
around
the
jagged
walls
and
stumbled
foolishly
over
each
other
and
all
the
other
tripping
things
in
their
dungeons
had
succeeded
in
forcing
apart
the
wooden
doors
between
their
three
cells
and
joining
forces
or
joining
weaknesses
rather
because
when
they
finally
found
the
cellar
stairs
they
also
found
that
for
all
the
strength
they
could
throw
into
their
backs
and
shoulders
they
could
not
lift
the
door
with
all
the
heavy
weights
put
on
it
by
the
dozen
there
were
a
few
matches
in
the
crowd
and
they
sufficed
to
reveal
the
little
cellar
windows
these
they
reached
by
forming
a
human
ladder
as
the
gauls
scaled
the
walls
of
rome
only
to
find
that
a
flock
of
silly
geese
had
foiled
their
plans
but
there
were
no
geese
to
disturb
the
crows
and
the
first
of
their
number
managed
to
worm
through
to
the
outer
air
and
help
up
his
fellows
in
misery
it
seemed
for
a
time
though
as
if
even
this
escape
were
to
be
cut
off
for
a
very
fat
crow
got
himself
stuck
in
a
little
window
and
the
crows
outside
could
not
pull
him
through
tug
as
they
would
then
the
crows
inside
began
to
pull
at
his
feet
and
to
hang
their
whole
weight
on
his
legs
but
still
he
stuck
then
they
all
grew
excited
and
both
the
outsiders
and
the
insiders
pulled
at
once
until
the
luckless
fat
boy
thought
they
were
trying
to
make
twins
of
him
and
howled
for
mercy
he
might
have
been
there
to
this
day
had
he
not
managed
by
some
mysterious
and
painful
wriggle
to
crawl
through
unaided
before
long
then
the
whole
crowd
of
cellar
crows
was
standing
out
in
the
cold
air
and
asking
the
cupola
crows
why
they
did
come
down
one
of
the
crows
irish
by
descent
suddenly
started
off
on
the
run
the
others
called
him
back
and
asked
what
he
was
going
for
for
a
he
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
they
asked
and
he
answered
going
to
throw
a
rope
and
pull
down
then
he
wondered
why
they
all
groaned
the
word
rope
however
suggested
an
idea
to
the
cupola
prisoners
and
after
much
groping
they
found
the
and
one
of
them
cut
off
a
good
length
of
it
they
fastened
it
securely
then
and
slid
down
to
the
next
floor
whence
they
made
their
way
without
much
difficulty
down
the
stairs
to
the
ground
there
they
found
the
outer
door
firmly
locked
then
they
felt
sadder
than
over
but
by
this
time
the
hubbub
they
had
raised
had
brought
on
the
scene
several
of
the
instructors
one
of
whom
had
a
duplicate
key
of
the
gymnasium
and
they
suffered
the
terrible
humiliation
of
being
released
by
one
of
the
faculty
on
being
questioned
as
to
the
cause
of
such
a
breach
of
the
peace
of
the
academy
all
the
seventeen
crows
attempted
to
explain
the
and
inexcusable
conduct
of
the
wicked
dozen
which
had
picked
on
eighteen
defenseless
men
and
made
them
prisoners
the
instructor
had
been
a
boy
himself
once
and
he
could
not
entirely
conceal
a
little
smile
at
the
thought
of
the
cruelty
of
the
lakerim
twelve
just
then
macmanus
came
by
and
with
one
accord
the
crows
exclaimed
where
did
they
tie
you
up
down
at
moore
restaurant
said
macmanus
sheepishly
well
what
has
happened
to
the
banquet
they
exclaimed
it
all
eaten
groaned
macmanus
who
ate
it
cawed
the
crows
the
dozen
moaned
macmanus
and
that
was
the
last
straw
that
broke
the
crows
backs
they
threatened
all
sorts
of
revenge
and
some
of
the
of
them
went
to
the
faculty
and
suggested
that
the
best
thing
that
could
be
done
was
to
expel
the
lakerim
men
in
a
body
but
by
a
little
questioning
the
faculty
learned
of
the
attempted
hazing
that
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
matter
and
decided
that
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
reprimand
and
warn
both
the
crows
and
the
dozen
and
make
them
solemnly
promise
to
bury
the
hatchet
which
they
did
and
thus
ended
one
of
the
bitterest
feuds
of
modern
times
xii
now
heady
who
had
set
the
whole
kidnapping
scheme
on
foot
as
soon
as
he
joined
the
dozen
at
kingston
had
brought
to
the
academy
no
particular
love
for
study
but
he
had
brought
a
great
enthusiasm
for
and
this
enthusiasm
was
catching
and
he
soon
had
many
of
the
kingstonians
working
hard
in
the
gymnasium
and
organizing
scrub
teams
to
play
this
most
bewilderingly
rapid
of
games
most
of
the
lakerimmers
went
in
for
pure
love
of
excitement
but
when
heady
said
that
it
was
especially
good
as
an
indoor
winter
exercise
to
keep
men
in
trim
for
football
and
baseball
tug
and
punk
immediately
went
at
it
with
great
enthusiasm
but
tug
was
so
mixed
up
in
the
slight
differences
between
this
game
and
his
beloved
football
and
so
insisted
upon
running
which
is
against
the
rules
of
and
upon
tackling
which
is
against
the
rules
and
upon
kicking
which
is
against
the
rules
that
he
finally
gave
up
in
despair
and
said
that
if
he
became
a
good
player
he
would
be
a
poor
and
football
was
his
earlier
love
sleepy
however
who
was
the
great
baseball
sharp
made
this
complaint
in
his
drawling
fashion
the
rules
say
you
can
only
hold
the
ball
five
seconds
and
it
takes
me
at
least
ten
seconds
to
decide
what
to
do
with
it
so
i
guess
the
blamed
game
is
for
me
out
of
the
many
candidates
for
the
team
the
following
regular
five
were
chosen
for
center
who
was
tall
enough
to
do
the
in
excellent
style
and
who
could
by
spreading
out
his
great
arms
present
in
front
of
an
ambitious
enemy
a
surface
as
big
as
a
windmill
almost
the
was
heady
and
of
course
the
had
to
be
his
other
half
reddy
pretty
managed
by
his
skill
in
to
make
the
position
of
and
the
was
the
chief
of
the
crows
macmanus
the
dozen
treated
him
if
not
as
an
equal
at
least
as
one
who
had
a
right
to
be
alive
and
move
about
upon
the
same
earth
with
them
the
kingston
team
played
many
games
and
grew
in
speed
and
till
they
were
looked
upon
as
a
terror
by
the
rest
of
the
interscholastic
league
finally
indeed
they
landed
the
championship
of
the
various
teams
of
the
academies
but
just
before
they
played
their
last
triumphant
game
in
the
league
and
when
they
were
feeling
their
oats
and
acting
as
rambunctious
and
as
bumptious
as
a
crowd
of
almost
undefeated
boys
sometimes
chooses
to
be
they
received
a
challenge
that
caused
them
to
laugh
long
and
loud
at
first
it
looked
like
a
huge
joke
for
the
kingston
team
to
be
challenged
by
a
team
from
the
palatine
institute
then
it
began
to
look
like
an
insult
and
they
were
angry
at
such
treatment
of
such
great
men
as
they
admitted
themselves
to
be
it
occurred
to
however
that
before
they
sent
back
an
indignant
refusal
to
play
they
might
as
well
look
up
the
record
of
the
men
after
a
little
investigation
to
their
surprise
they
found
that
these
men
were
astoundingly
clever
players
and
had
won
game
after
game
from
the
best
teams
so
they
accepted
the
challenge
in
lordly
manner
and
in
due
time
the
palatiners
appeared
upon
the
floor
of
the
kingston
gymnasium
a
large
audience
had
gathered
and
was
seated
in
the
gallery
where
the
ran
among
the
spectators
was
that
girl
to
whom
both
reddy
and
heady
were
devoted
the
girl
who
could
not
decide
between
them
she
liked
both
of
them
so
immensely
especially
as
she
herself
was
the
champion
player
among
the
girls
at
her
seminary
each
of
the
twins
resolved
that
he
would
not
only
outdo
all
the
rest
of
the
players
upon
the
gymnasium
floor
but
also
his
bitter
rival
his
brother
there
was
something
uncanny
at
first
in
the
playing
of
the
palatines
all
of
whom
were
except
the
captain
who
was
neither
deaf
nor
dumb
but
understood
and
talked
the
sign
language
the
game
opened
with
the
usual
the
referee
called
the
two
centers
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
then
tossed
the
ball
high
in
the
air
between
them
they
leaped
as
far
as
they
could
but
enormous
height
carried
him
far
beyond
the
other
man
and
giving
the
ball
a
smart
slap
he
sent
it
directly
into
the
clutch
of
reddy
who
had
run
on
and
was
waiting
to
receive
it
half
over
his
shoulder
finding
himself
covered
by
the
opposing
forward
he
passed
the
ball
quickly
under
the
other
man
arm
across
to
heady
who
had
run
down
the
other
side
of
the
floor
heady
received
the
ball
without
obstruction
and
by
a
quick
overhead
fling
landed
it
in
the
high
basket
and
scored
the
first
point
while
applause
and
wonderment
were
loud
in
the
gallery
the
kingstonians
played
like
one
man
if
you
can
imagine
one
man
with
twenty
arms
and
legs
made
such
high
leaps
and
covered
so
well
and
sent
the
ball
so
well
through
the
forwards
and
supported
them
so
well
the
twin
forwards
dodged
and
ran
and
passed
and
dribbled
the
ball
with
such
dash
and
the
guards
were
so
alert
in
the
protection
of
their
goal
and
in
obstructing
the
throwing
of
the
other
forwards
that
three
goals
and
the
score
of
six
were
rolled
up
in
an
amazingly
short
time
was
in
so
many
places
at
once
and
kept
all
four
limbs
going
so
violently
that
the
spectators
began
to
cheer
him
on
as
granddaddy
longlegs
a
loud
laugh
was
raised
on
one
occasion
when
the
palatine
captain
got
the
ball
and
holding
it
high
in
the
air
to
make
a
try
for
goal
from
the
field
found
himself
covered
by
the
towering
he
curved
the
ball
downward
where
one
of
the
twins
leaped
for
it
in
front
then
he
wriggled
and
writhed
with
it
till
it
was
between
his
legs
but
there
the
other
twin
was
and
with
a
quick
wringing
clutch
that
nearly
tied
the
opposing
captain
into
a
he
had
the
ball
away
from
him
at
the
end
of
the
three
goals
the
kingstonians
began
to
whisper
to
themselves
that
they
had
what
they
were
pleased
to
call
a
cinch
they
alluded
to
the
palatines
as
easy
fruit
and
began
to
make
a
number
of
fresh
and
plays
the
inevitable
and
proper
result
of
this
funny
business
was
that
they
began
to
grow
careless
the
unusually
alert
in
other
ways
on
account
of
the
loss
of
hearing
and
speech
were
quick
to
see
the
opportunity
and
to
play
with
unexpected
carefulness
and
dash
the
swelled
heads
of
the
kingstonians
were
reduced
to
normal
size
when
the
palatines
quickly
scored
two
goals
it
began
to
look
as
if
they
would
add
a
third
score
when
the
desperate
reddy
seeing
one
of
the
palatine
forwards
about
to
make
a
try
for
goal
made
a
leaping
tackle
that
destroyed
the
man
aim
and
almost
upset
him
reddy
was
just
secretly
congratulating
himself
upon
his
breach
of
etiquette
when
the
shrill
whistle
of
the
referee
brought
dismay
to
his
heart
his
act
was
declared
a
foul
and
the
palatines
were
given
a
free
throw
their
was
allowed
to
take
his
stand
fifteen
feet
from
the
basket
and
have
an
unobstructed
try
at
it
the
throw
was
successful
and
the
score
now
stood
to
in
favor
of
kingston
the
game
went
rapidly
on
and
at
one
stage
the
ball
was
declared
held
by
the
referee
and
it
was
faced
off
well
toward
the
palatine
goal
made
a
particularly
high
leap
in
the
air
and
an
unusually
fierce
whack
at
the
ball
to
his
chagrin
it
went
up
into
the
gallery
and
struck
the
girl
to
whom
the
twins
were
so
devoted
smack
upon
her
pretty
snub
nose
though
the
blow
was
hard
enough
to
bring
tears
to
her
bright
eyes
she
smiled
and
with
a
laugh
and
a
blush
picked
up
the
ball
and
dropped
it
over
the
rail
the
twins
both
made
a
dash
to
receive
this
gift
from
her
pretty
hands
and
in
consequence
bumped
into
each
other
and
fell
apart
the
ball
which
they
had
robbed
each
other
of
fell
into
the
clutch
of
pretty
who
made
the
girl
a
graceful
bow
that
quite
won
her
heart
pretty
was
by
the
way
always
cutting
the
other
fellows
out
this
was
the
only
grudge
they
ever
had
against
him
the
twins
were
now
more
rattled
than
ever
and
heady
determined
to
do
or
die
he
saw
one
of
the
palatines
running
forward
and
looking
backward
to
receive
the
ball
on
a
long
pass
and
he
gave
him
a
vicious
he
knew
it
was
a
foul
at
the
time
but
he
thought
the
referee
was
not
looking
his
punishment
was
fittingly
double
for
not
only
did
the
referee
see
and
declare
the
foul
but
the
big
palatine
came
with
such
impetus
that
he
knocked
heady
heady
went
scraping
along
a
row
of
single
sticks
and
wooden
making
a
noise
like
the
rattle
of
a
board
along
a
picket
fence
then
he
tumbled
in
a
heap
with
the
palatine
man
on
top
of
him
as
the
palatine
man
got
up
he
dislodged
a
number
of
indian
clubs
which
fairly
pelted
the
prostrate
heady
this
foul
gave
the
palatines
another
free
throw
and
made
the
score
a
tie
xiii
the
twins
were
now
so
angry
and
ashamed
of
themselves
that
they
played
worse
than
ever
everything
seemed
to
go
wrong
with
them
their
passes
were
blocked
their
tries
for
goal
failed
the
palatines
would
not
even
help
them
out
with
a
foul
in
their
general
disorder
of
plan
they
could
do
nothing
to
prevent
the
palatines
from
making
goal
after
goal
till
when
the
referee
whistle
announced
that
the
first
half
was
over
the
score
stood
to
against
kingston
the
twins
were
feeling
sore
enough
as
it
was
but
when
they
went
to
the
dripping
with
sweat
and
gasping
for
breath
from
their
hard
exertions
tug
appeared
to
rub
salt
into
their
wounds
by
a
little
lecture
upon
their
shortcomings
and
fargoings
heady
he
said
i
guess
you
have
been
away
from
us
a
little
too
long
the
lakerim
athletic
club
never
approved
of
foul
playing
on
the
part
of
itself
or
any
one
else
and
you
got
just
what
you
deserved
for
forgetting
your
dignity
i
suppose
reddy
got
the
disease
from
you
but
i
want
to
say
right
here
that
you
have
got
to
play
like
lakerim
men
or
there
is
going
to
be
trouble
the
twins
realized
the
depths
of
their
disgrace
before
tug
spoke
and
they
were
too
much
humiliated
in
their
own
hearts
to
resent
his
lofty
tone
they
determined
to
wipe
the
disgrace
out
in
the
only
way
it
could
be
effaced
by
brilliant
clean
playing
in
the
second
half
of
the
game
when
the
intermission
was
over
they
went
in
with
such
vim
that
they
broke
up
all
the
plans
of
the
palatines
for
gaining
goal
and
put
them
to
a
very
fierce
defensive
game
heady
soon
scored
a
goal
by
passing
the
ball
back
to
reddy
and
then
running
forward
well
into
palatine
territory
and
receiving
it
on
a
long
pass
and
tossing
it
into
the
basket
before
he
could
be
obstructed
but
this
ray
of
hope
was
immediately
dimmed
by
the
curious
action
of
macmanus
who
forgetting
that
he
was
not
on
the
football
field
and
receiving
the
ball
unexpectedly
made
a
brilliant
run
down
the
field
with
it
carrying
it
firmly
against
his
body
he
was
brought
back
with
a
expression
and
the
realization
that
he
had
unconsciously
played
foul
and
given
the
palatines
another
free
throw
which
made
their
score
to
a
little
later
reddy
finding
himself
with
his
back
to
the
palatine
goal
and
all
chance
of
passing
the
ball
to
his
brother
foiled
by
the
large
overshadowing
form
of
the
palatine
captain
determined
to
make
a
long
shot
at
luck
and
threw
the
ball
backward
over
his
head
a
loud
yell
and
a
burst
of
applause
announced
that
fortune
had
favored
him
he
had
landed
the
ball
exactly
in
the
basket
but
heady
went
him
one
better
for
he
made
a
similarly
marvelous
goal
with
a
smaller
element
of
luck
finding
himself
in
a
good
position
for
a
try
he
was
about
to
send
the
ball
with
the
overhead
throw
that
is
usual
when
he
was
confronted
by
a
palatine
guard
who
completely
covered
all
the
space
in
front
of
the
diminutive
heady
like
a
flash
heady
dropped
to
the
floor
in
a
attitude
and
gave
the
ball
a
quick
upward
throw
between
the
man
outspread
legs
and
up
into
the
basket
and
now
the
audience
went
wild
indeed
at
seeing
two
such
plays
as
have
been
seen
only
once
or
twice
in
the
history
of
the
game
with
the
score
of
to
in
their
favor
the
palatines
made
a
strong
rally
and
prevented
the
kingstonians
from
scoring
they
were
tired
and
evidently
thought
that
their
safety
lay
in
sparring
for
time
and
the
referee
seemed
willing
to
aid
them
for
his
watch
was
in
his
hand
and
the
game
had
only
the
life
of
a
few
seconds
to
live
when
the
ball
fell
into
the
hands
of
heady
the
desperate
boy
realized
that
now
he
had
the
final
chance
to
retrieve
the
day
and
wrest
victory
from
defeat
he
was
far
far
from
the
basket
but
he
did
not
dare
to
risk
the
precious
moment
in
dribbling
or
passing
the
ball
the
only
hope
lay
in
one
perfect
throw
he
held
the
ball
in
his
hands
high
over
his
head
and
bent
far
back
he
straightened
himself
like
a
bow
when
the
arrow
of
the
indian
leaves
its
side
he
gave
a
spring
into
the
air
and
launched
the
ball
at
the
little
basket
it
soared
on
an
arc
as
beautiful
as
a
rainbow
it
landed
full
in
the
basket
but
the
force
of
the
blow
was
so
great
that
the
ball
choggled
about
and
bounded
out
upon
the
rim
there
it
halted
tantalizingly
rolled
around
the
edge
of
the
basket
trembled
as
if
hesitating
whether
to
give
victory
to
the
palatines
or
the
kingstons
after
what
seemed
an
age
of
this
dallying
it
slowly
dropped
to
the
floor
a
deep
deep
sigh
came
from
the
lips
of
all
even
the
palatines
and
down
into
the
hearts
of
the
twins
there
went
a
solemn
pain
they
had
lost
the
game
that
was
bad
enough
but
they
knew
that
they
deserved
to
lose
it
that
their
own
misplays
had
brought
their
own
punishment
but
they
bore
their
ordeal
pluckily
and
when
the
next
week
they
met
another
team
they
played
a
clean
swift
game
that
won
them
stainless
laurels
xiv
set
quiz
to
wondering
what
he
could
do
to
occupy
his
spare
moments
for
the
drifts
were
too
deep
for
him
to
continue
his
beloved
pastime
of
bicycling
and
he
had
to
put
his
wheel
out
of
commission
so
he
went
nosing
about
trying
a
little
of
everything
and
being
satisfied
with
nothing
the
academy
hockey
team
of
which
jumbo
was
the
leader
was
working
out
a
fine
game
and
making
its
prowess
felt
among
the
rival
teams
of
the
interscholastic
league
but
hockey
did
not
interest
quiz
for
though
he
could
almost
sleep
on
a
bicycle
without
falling
over
when
he
put
on
a
pair
of
skates
you
might
have
thought
that
he
was
trying
to
turn
somersaults
or
describe
in
the
air
it
was
a
little
cold
for
rowing
though
quiz
pulled
a
very
decent
oar
and
the
shell
would
hardly
go
through
the
ice
at
an
interesting
speed
indoor
work
in
the
gymnasium
was
also
too
slow
for
quiz
and
he
was
asking
every
one
what
pastime
there
was
to
interest
a
young
man
who
required
speed
in
anything
that
was
to
hold
his
attention
at
length
he
bethought
him
of
a
sport
he
had
seen
practised
during
a
visit
he
paid
once
to
some
relatives
in
minnesota
where
the
many
norwegian
immigrants
practised
the
art
of
running
upon
the
skies
at
first
sight
this
statement
looks
as
if
it
might
have
come
out
of
the
adventures
of
that
trustworthy
historian
baron
münchhäusen
but
the
skies
you
are
thinking
of
are
not
the
skies
i
mean
the
scandinavian
skies
are
not
blue
and
they
are
not
overhead
but
underfoot
of
course
you
know
all
about
the
norwegian
ski
but
perhaps
your
younger
brother
does
not
so
i
will
say
for
his
benefit
that
the
ski
is
a
sort
of
norwegian
only
it
is
almost
as
swift
as
the
boots
when
you
put
it
on
you
look
as
if
you
had
a
toboggan
on
each
foot
for
it
is
a
strip
of
ash
half
an
inch
thick
half
a
dozen
inches
wide
and
some
ten
feet
long
the
front
end
of
it
pointed
and
turned
up
like
that
of
a
toboggan
when
you
first
get
the
things
on
or
rather
get
on
them
you
learn
that
however
pleasant
they
may
grow
to
be
as
servants
they
are
certainly
pretty
bad
masters
and
you
will
find
that
the
groove
which
is
run
in
the
bottom
of
the
skies
to
prevent
their
spreading
is
of
very
little
assistance
for
they
seem
to
have
a
will
of
their
own
and
also
a
bitter
grudge
against
each
other
they
step
on
each
other
one
moment
and
make
a
wild
bolt
in
opposite
directions
the
next
and
behave
generally
like
a
pair
of
unbroken
colts
quiz
had
once
learned
to
walk
on
he
grew
to
be
quite
an
adept
indeed
and
could
take
a
hurdle
with
little
difficulty
but
he
soon
found
that
so
far
from
being
a
help
his
familiarity
with
the
was
a
great
hindrance
the
mode
of
walking
on
a
canadian
which
he
had
learned
with
such
difficulty
had
to
be
completely
unlearned
before
he
could
begin
to
make
progress
with
the
scandinavian
footgear
for
in
walking
the
feet
must
be
lifted
straight
up
and
then
carried
forward
before
they
are
planted
and
any
attempt
to
slide
them
forward
makes
a
woeful
tangle
to
try
to
lift
the
ski
off
the
ground
however
is
to
invite
ridiculous
distress
and
the
whole
art
of
scooting
on
the
ski
is
in
the
long
sliding
motion
it
is
a
sort
of
skating
on
incredibly
long
skates
that
must
not
be
lifted
from
the
snow
quiz
had
the
skies
made
by
a
kingston
carpenter
and
he
was
so
proud
of
them
that
when
a
crowd
gathered
to
see
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
the
mysterious
slats
he
proceeded
to
make
his
first
attempt
in
an
open
space
in
the
academy
campus
he
put
the
skies
down
on
the
snow
slipped
his
toes
into
the
straps
and
sweeping
a
proud
glance
around
among
the
wondering
kingstonians
dashed
forward
in
his
old
fashion
it
took
the
kingstonians
some
seconds
to
decide
which
was
quiz
and
which
was
ski
for
the
skittish
skies
skewed
and
skedaddled
and
skulked
and
skipped
and
scrubbed
and
screwed
and
screamed
and
scrawled
and
scooped
and
scrabbled
and
scrambled
and
scambled
and
scumbled
and
scraped
and
scrunched
and
scudded
and
scuttled
and
scuffled
and
skimped
and
scattered
in
such
scandalous
scampishness
that
the
scornful
scholars
scoffed
quiz
quit
the
poor
boy
was
so
laughed
at
for
days
by
the
whole
academy
that
his
spunk
was
finally
aroused
he
got
out
again
the
skies
he
had
hidden
away
in
disgust
and
practised
upon
them
in
the
fields
at
a
distance
from
the
campus
until
he
had
finally
broken
the
broncos
and
made
a
swift
and
delightful
team
of
them
he
soon
grew
strong
enough
to
glide
for
hours
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
without
weariness
and
the
ski
became
a
serious
rival
to
the
bicycle
in
his
affections
he
learned
to
shoot
the
hills
at
a
breathless
rate
climbing
up
swiftly
to
the
top
then
with
feet
apart
but
even
zipping
like
an
down
the
steep
incline
and
far
along
the
level
below
he
even
risked
his
bones
by
attempting
the
rash
deeds
of
old
reaching
an
embankment
he
would
retire
a
little
distance
and
then
rush
forward
to
the
brink
and
leap
over
into
the
air
lighting
on
the
ground
below
far
out
steadying
himself
quickly
and
shooting
on
at
terrific
pace

rashness

its
own
punishment

xv
at
dinner
one
saturday
quiz
had
broken
out
in
exclamations
of
delight
over
his
pet
skies
and
had
begun
to
complain
about
the
time
when
spring
should
drive
away
the
blessed
winter
i
ca
get
enough
of
the
snow
he
exclaimed
oh
ca
you
said
jumbo
ominously
quiz
could
hardly
finish
his
dinner
so
impatient
was
he
to
be
up
and
off
again
over
the
hills
and
far
away
when
he
had
gone
jumbo
asked
the
other
lakerimmers
if
they
had
not
noticed
how
exclusive
quiz
was
becoming
and
how
little
they
saw
of
him
he
said
also
that
he
did
not
approve
of
quiz
rushing
all
over
the
country
alone
and
taking
foolish
risks
for
the
sake
of
a
little
solitary
fun
the
lakerimmers
agreed
that
something
should
be
done
and
jumbo
reminded
them
of
quiz
remark
that
he
could
not
get
enough
snow
and
suggested
a
plan
that
he
thought
might
work
as
a
good
medicine
on
him
that
afternoon
quiz
seemed
to
have
quite
lost
his
head
over
his
he
felt
that
there
were
signs
of
a
thaw
in
the
air
and
he
proposed
that
this
snow
should
not
fade
away
before
he
had
indulged
in
one
grand
farewell
voyage
he
struck
off
into
the
country
by
a
new
road
and
at
such
a
speed
that
he
was
soon
among
unfamiliar
surroundings
as
the
day
began
to
droop
toward
twilight
he
decided
that
it
was
high
time
to
be
turning
back
toward
kingston
he
looked
about
for
one
last
embankment
to
shoot
before
he
retraced
his
course
far
in
the
distance
he
thought
he
saw
a
fine
high
bluff
and
he
hurried
toward
it
with
delicious
expectation
when
he
had
reached
the
brink
he
looked
down
and
saw
that
the
bluff
ended
in
a
little
body
of
water
hardly
big
enough
to
be
called
a
lake
after
measuring
the
drop
with
his
eye
and
deciding
that
while
it
was
higher
than
anything
he
had
ever
shot
before
it
was
just
risky
enough
to
be
exciting
he
went
back
several
steps
came
forward
with
a
good
impetus
and
launched
himself
fearlessly
into
the
air
like
the
aëronaughty
darius
green
he
launched
himself
fearlessly
enough
but
he
was
no
sooner
in
than
he
began
to
regret
his
rashness
it
was
rather
late
now
though
to
be
thinking
of
that
and
he
realized
that
nothing
could
save
him
from
having
a
sudden
meeting
with
the
bottom
of
the
hill
he
lost
his
nerve
in
his
excitement
and
crossed
his
skies
so
that
when
he
struck
instead
of
sailing
forward
like
the
wind
he
stuck
and
went
headforemost
fortunately
one
of
his
skies
broke
instead
of
most
of
his
bones
and
a
very
appeared
like
a
and
somewhat
checked
the
force
of
his
fall
but
for
all
that
he
was
soon
rolling
over
and
over
down
the
hill
and
he
landed
finally
on
a
thin
spot
in
the
ice
of
the
lake
and
crashed
through
into
the
water
up
to
his
waist
now
he
was
so
that
he
scrambled
frantically
out
he
cast
one
sorry
glance
up
the
hill
and
saw
there
the
pieces
into
which
his
ski
had
cracked
as
well
as
the
pathway
he
himself
had
cleared
in
the
snow
as
he
came
tumbling
down
then
he
looked
for
the
other
ski
and
realised
that
it
was
far
away
under
the
ice
he
was
now
so
cold
that
dripping
as
he
was
he
would
not
have
waded
into
the
lake
again
to
grope
around
for
the
other
ski
if
that
ski
had
been
solid
gold
studded
with
diamonds
plainly
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
make
for
home
and
that
right
quickly
before
night
came
on
and
he
lost
his
way
and
the
pneumonia
got
him
it
was
a
very
different
story
trudging
back
through
the
in
the
twilight
from
flitting
like
a
butterfly
on
the
ski
he
realized
now
that
his
legs
were
tired
from
the
long
run
he
had
enjoyed
so
much
he
lost
his
way
too
time
and
again
and
when
he
came
to
a
and
had
to
guess
for
himself
which
path
to
take
somehow
or
other
he
seemed
always
to
take
the
wrong
one
and
to
plod
along
it
until
he
met
some
farmer
to
put
him
on
the
right
path
to
kingston
but
though
he
met
many
a
farmer
he
seemed
to
find
never
a
wagon
going
his
way
or
even
a
he
was
still
miles
away
from
kingston
when
time
came
a
little
gleam
came
cheerfully
toward
him
out
of
the
dark
he
hurried
to
it
thinking
of
the
fine
supper
the
farmers
would
doubtless
give
him
when
just
as
he
reached
the
gate
of
the
there
was
a
most
uproar
and
two
or
three
furious
dogs
came
bounding
shadowily
toward
him
he
lost
no
time
in
deciding
that
supper
after
all
was
a
rather
useless
invention
and
kingston
much
preferable
previously
to
this
quiz
had
always
understood
that
the
dog
was
the
most
of
animals
but
it
was
months
after
that
night
before
he
could
hear
the
mere
name
of
a
canine
without
shuddering
well
a
boy
can
cover
any
distance
imaginable
even
the
path
to
the
moon
if
he
only
has
the
strength
and
the
time
so
quiz
finally
reached
the
outskirts
of
kingston
his
long
walk
had
dried
and
warmed
him
somewhat
but
he
was
miserably
tired
and
he
felt
that
his
stomach
was
as
empty
as
the
desert
of
sahara
at
last
though
he
reached
the
campus
and
dragged
heavily
along
the
path
to
his
dormitory
he
stopped
at
tug
to
see
if
tug
had
any
remains
left
of
the
latest
box
of
good
things
from
home
but
no
answer
came
to
his
knock
and
he
went
sadly
up
to
the
next
lakerim
room
but
that
was
empty
too
and
all
of
the
others
of
the
dozen
were
away
for
they
had
become
alarmed
at
quiz
absence
and
started
out
in
search
of
him
as
they
had
once
before
set
forth
on
the
trail
of
tug
and
history
illustration
jumbo
saw
a
pair
of
flashing
eyes
glaring
at
him
over
the
coverlet
by
the
time
quiz
reached
his
room
he
was
too
tired
to
be
very
hungry
and
he
decided
that
his
bed
would
be
paradise
enough
so
all
cold
and
weary
as
he
was
he
hastily
peeled
off
his
clothes
and
blew
out
the
light
he
shivered
at
the
very
thought
of
the
coldness
of
the
sheets
but
he
fairly
flung
himself
between
them
just
of
a
second
he
spent
in
his
downy
couch
and
then
leaped
out
on
the
floor
with
a
howl
he
remembered
suddenly
the
look
jumbo
had
given
him
at
dinner
when
he
had
said
he
could
not
get
snow
enough
jumbo
and
the
other
fiends
from
lakerim
had
filled
the
lower
half
of
his
bed
with
it
late
that
night
when
the
eleven
lakerimmers
came
back
weary
from
their
long
search
and
frightened
at
not
finding
quiz
jumbo
went
to
his
room
with
a
sad
heart
when
he
lighted
his
lamp
and
looked
longingly
toward
his
downy
bed
he
saw
a
pair
of
flashing
eyes
glaring
at
him
over
the
coverlet
they
were
the
eyes
of
quiz
and
within
easy
reach
lay
a
baseball
bat
and
several
large
lumps
of
coal
but
all
quiz
said
was
excuse
me
for
getting
into
your
bed
jumbo
you
are
perfectly
welcome
to
mine
xvi
but
speaking
of
cold
you
ought
to
hear
about
the
great
fire
company
that
was
organized
at
the
academy
the
town
of
kingston
was
not
large
enough
or
rich
enough
to
support
a
fire
department
with
paid
firemen
and
trained
horses
it
had
nothing
but
an
engine
a
and
a
all
of
which
had
to
be
drawn
by
steeds
the
volunteer
firemen
of
the
village
the
lakerimmers
had
not
been
in
kingston
many
weeks
before
they
heard
the
lift
its
voice
it
was
not
more
than
twenty
minutes
before
the
kingston
fire
department
appeared
galloping
along
the
rough
road
in
front
of
the
campus
at
a
fearsome
speed
of
about
six
miles
an
hour
several
of
the
horses
wore
long
white
beards
and
others
of
them
were
so
fat
that
they
added
more
weight
than
power
to
the
team
such
of
the
academicians
as
had
no
classes
at
that
hour
followed
these
champing
chargers
to
the
scene
of
the
fire
it
turned
out
to
be
a
woodshed
which
was
as
black
and
useless
as
a
burnt
biscuit
by
the
time
the
fire
department
arrived
but
the
volunteers
had
the
pleasure
of
dropping
a
hose
down
the
well
of
the
owner
of
the
late
lamented
woodshed
and
pumping
the
well
dry
the
volunteers
thus
bravely
extinguished
three
that
had
caught
fire
from
the
woodshed
and
then
turned
for
home
proud
in
the
consciousness
of
duty
performed
they
felt
sure
that
they
had
saved
the
village
from
a
second
chicago
fire
jumbo
said
that
the
department
ought
not
to
be
called
the
volunteers
but
the
crawfishes
who
had
a
scientific
turn
of
mind
said
that
he
had
an
idea
for
a
great
invention
the
world
revolves
from
west
to
east
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
miles
an
hour
he
said
i
heard
so
broke
in
jumbo
but
you
ca
believe
everything
you
see
in
print
brushed
him
aside
and
went
on
now
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
invent
a
scheme
for
raising
your
and
your
firemen
up
in
the
air
a
few
feet
and
holding
them
still
while
the
earth
revolves
under
them
then
you
turn
a
kind
of
a
wheel
or
something
when
the
place
you
want
to
get
to
comes
around
and
there
you
are
in
a
jiffy
it
would
beat
the
empire
state
express
all
hollow
why
it
would
be
faster
even
than
an
he
exclaimed
enthusiastically
i
guess
i
have
to
get
that
idea
patented
but
say
said
bobbles
in
a
puzzled
manner
suppose
your
fire
was
in
the
other
direction
you
have
to
go
clear
around
the
world
to
get
to
the
place
i
did
think
of
that
said
dejectedly
and
thus
one
of
the
greatest
inventions
of
the
age
was
left
uninvented
but
tug
had
also
been
set
to
thinking
by
the
kingston
firemen
what
this
place
really
needs
he
said
is
some
firemen
that
can
run
they
want
more
speed
and
less
rheumatism
now
if
we
fellows
could
only
join
the
department
we
show
a
few
things
why
ca
we
said
punk
always
ready
to
carry
out
suggestion
george
washington
was
a
volunteer
fireman
was
reminder
from
the
books
the
scheme
took
like
with
the
dozen
and
after
a
conference
in
which
the
twelve
heads
got
as
close
together
as
large
feet
would
permit
it
was
decided
to
ask
permission
of
the
academy
faculty
and
of
the
town
trustees
the
kingston
faculty
was
of
the
general
opinion
that
it
is
ordinarily
though
by
no
means
always
the
best
plan
to
allow
restless
boys
to
carry
out
their
own
schemes
if
the
scheme
is
a
bad
one
they
will
be
more
likely
to
be
convinced
of
it
by
putting
it
into
practice
than
by
being
told
that
it
is
bad
and
forbidden
to
attempt
it
so
after
long
deliberation
they
consented
to
permit
half
a
dozen
of
the
larger
lakerim
fellows
to
join
the
volunteer
department
fires
were
not
frequent
and
most
of
the
buildings
of
the
village
were
so
small
that
little
risk
was
to
be
feared
the
trustees
of
the
village
saw
little
harm
in
allowing
the
academicians
to
drag
their
heavy
trucks
for
them
and
promised
that
they
would
not
permit
the
boys
to
rush
into
any
dangerous
places
in
a
short
while
then
the
were
firemen
with
red
flannel
shirts
rubber
boots
and
regulation
hats
the
lakerimmers
were
so
proud
of
their
new
honor
that
they
wanted
to
wear
their
gorgeous
uniforms
in
the
but
the
heartless
faculty
put
its
foot
down
hard
on
this
the
very
minute
the
six
tug
punk
sleepy
and
the
twins
were
safely
installed
as
volunteers
it
seemed
that
the
whole
town
had
suddenly
become
the
boys
could
neither
study
their
lessons
nor
recite
them
with
more
than
half
a
mind
for
they
had
always
one
ear
raised
for
the
sound
of
the
delightful
they
always
hoped
that
when
the
fire
would
come
it
would
be
in
the
midst
of
a
recitation
and
sleepy
constantly
failed
to
prepare
himself
at
all
in
the
hope
that
at
the
critical
moment
he
would
be
rescued
from
flunking
by
a
call
to
higher
duties
but
fate
was
ironical
and
after
two
or
three
weeks
of
this
existence
the
volunteers
began
to
lose
hope
one
saturday
afternoon
when
the
roads
were
frozen
into
ruts
as
hard
and
sharp
as
iron
and
when
the
dozen
had
just
started
forth
to
take
a
number
of
pretty
girls
to
see
a
promising
hockey
game
the
villainous
old
began
to
call
for
help
the
regretted
for
a
moment
that
they
had
ever
volunteered
to
be
volunteers
but
they
would
not
shirk
their
duty
and
instantly
dashed
toward
the
shed
where
the
fire
department
was
stored
they
were
there
long
before
any
of
the
older
volunteers
and
had
a
long
impatient
wait
then
there
were
all
manner
of
delays
breakages
had
to
be
repaired
and
axles
greased
before
a
start
could
be
properly
made
but
at
last
they
were
off
tearing
down
the
rough
roads
at
a
speed
that
made
the
older
firemen
plead
for
mercy
the
alarm
had
come
from
a
man
who
had
been
painting
a
church
steeple
and
had
seen
a
cloud
of
smoke
in
the
direction
of
the
mitchell
place
a
large
some
little
distance
out
of
the
village
limits
there
was
a
fine
exhilaration
about
the
run
until
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
town
and
began
to
drag
the
bouncing
jouncing
cart
over
the
miserable
country
road
still
they
tugged
on
going
slower
and
slower
and
the
older
volunteers
letting
go
of
the
rope
and
falling
by
the
wayside
like
the
wounded
at
the
hill
of
san
juan
finally
even
the
had
to
slacken
speed
too
and
walk
for
fear
of
losing
the
whole
fire
department
the
chief
had
already
given
out
in
exhaustion
and
insisted
upon
climbing
on
one
of
the
trucks
and
riding
the
rest
of
the
way
but
at
length
somehow
or
other
the
kingston
volunteers
reached
the
at
a
slow
walk
their
tongues
almost
hanging
out
of
their
mouths
and
their
breath
coming
in
gasps
strange
to
say
there
were
no
signs
of
excitement
at
the
mitchell
place
though
a
great
cloud
of
black
smoke
poured
from
a
huge
hollow
that
had
been
cut
off
about
ten
feet
from
the
ground
and
was
used
as
a
primitive
the
volunteers
looked
at
this
tree
and
then
at
one
another
without
a
word
then
mitchell
came
slowly
toward
his
gate
and
asked
why
he
had
been
honored
with
such
a
visit
the
only
one
that
had
breath
enough
to
say
a
word
was
the
fire
chief
who
had
ridden
the
latter
part
of
the
way
he
explained
the
alarm
and
asked
the
cause
of
the
smoke
mitchell
drawled
wawl
i
jest
some
hams
as
they
all
pegged
dismally
homeward
the
thought
that
mitchell
had
also
just
about
cured
six
volunteers
and
when
the
took
off
their
red
flannel
shirts
that
day
they
no
longer
looked
upon
them
as
red
badges
of
courage
but
rather
as
a
sort
of
penitentiary
uniform
the
fire
department
of
kingston
had
such
another
long
snooze
that
the
began
now
to
rejoice
in
the
hope
that
there
would
not
be
another
fire
before
they
had
almost
forgotten
that
they
were
volunteers
and
went
about
their
studies
and
pastimes
with
the
fine
of
glorious
boyhood
then
came
a
cold
wave
suddenly
out
of
the
west
a
tidal
wave
of
bitter
winds
and
blizzardy
that
sent
the
mercury
down
into
the
shoes
of
the
thermometer
things
froze
up
with
a
snap
that
you
could
almost
hear
it
seemed
that
it
would
be
impossible
even
to
put
a
nose
out
of
the
warm
rooms
without
hearing
a
sudden
crackle
and
seeing
it
drop
to
the
ground
and
the
ears
after
it
the
very
stoves
had
to
be
coaxed
and
coddled
to
keep
warm
jumbo
said
why
i
have
to
button
my
overcoat
around
my
stove
and
feed
it
with
coal
in
a
teaspoon
to
keep
it
from
freezing
to
death
the
academicians
went
to
and
from
their
classes
on
the
dead
run
and
even
the
staid
professors
scampered
along
the
slippery
paths
with
more
thought
of
speed
than
of
dignity
that
night
was
the
coldest
that
the
oldest
inhabitant
of
kingston
could
remember
the
very
winds
seemed
to
be
tearing
madly
about
trying
to
keep
warm
and
screaming
with
pain
they
were
so
cold
ugh
my
ears
tingle
to
think
of
it
the
lakerimmers
piled
the
coal
high
in
their
stoves
and
piled
their
overcoats
and
even
the
rugs
from
the
floor
over
their
beds
sleepy
whose
blood
was
so
slow
that
he
was
never
warm
enough
in
winter
and
never
very
warm
in
summer
even
spread
all
the
newspapers
he
could
find
inside
his
bed
and
crawled
in
between
them
having
heard
that
paper
is
one
of
the
warmest
of
coverings
the
journals
crackled
like
popcorn
every
time
he
moved
but
he
moved
very
little
and
it
would
have
been
a
loud
noise
indeed
that
could
have
kept
him
awake
at
a
very
early
hour
then
the
volunteers
and
the
rest
of
the
dozen
were
as
snug
as
bugs
in
rugs
and
then
oh
merciless
fate
at
the
coldest
and
dismalest
hour
of
the
whole
when
the
night
is
about
over
and
the
day
is
not
begun
at
about
what
oh
what
should
sound
even
above
the
howls
of
the
wind
and
the
rattlings
of
the
windows
and
doors
but
that
fiend
of
a
it
clanged
and
banged
and
clamored
and
boomed
and
pounded
its
way
even
through
the
harveyized
of
the
lakerim
ship
of
sleep
tug
was
the
first
to
wake
and
his
heart
almost
stopped
with
horror
of
the
time
the
old
bell
had
chosen
for
making
itself
heard
tug
was
a
brave
boy
and
he
had
a
high
sense
of
responsibility
but
he
had
also
a
high
sense
of
the
comfort
of
a
good
warm
bed
on
a
bitter
cold
night
and
he
lay
there
his
heart
torn
up
like
a
where
the
two
angels
of
duty
and
evil
fought
bitterly
and
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
give
them
plenty
of
time
to
fight
it
out
to
a
finish
in
another
room
of
the
dormitory
there
was
another
struggle
going
on
though
it
would
be
rather
flattering
to
say
that
they
were
angels
who
were
struggling
the
twins
had
wakened
at
the
same
moment
and
each
had
pretended
to
be
asleep
at
first
then
each
had
remembered
that
misery
loves
company
and
each
had
jabbed
the
other
in
the
ribs
at
the
same
time
what
bell
is
that
reddy
had
asked
heady
and
heady
had
asked
reddy
at
the
same
instant
it
that
both
exclaimed
each
answering
the
other
question
and
his
own
but
this
is
a
pretty
time
for
that
old
thing
to
break
out
wailed
reddy
it
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
itself
moaned
heady
it
too
bad
said
reddy
but
a
fireman
must
mind
the
wind
or
the
weather
that
so
sighed
heady
but
i
sorry
for
you
what
cried
reddy
you
sorry
for
what
the
matter
with
yourself
why
i
could
possibly
think
of
going
out
such
a
night
as
this
explained
heady
you
know
i
have
been
at
all
well
for
the
last
few
days
oh
have
you
complained
reddy
well
you
twice
as
well
as
i
am
and
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
to
shirk
your
duty
this
way
duty
humph
there
nothing
the
matter
with
you
it
would
be
criminal
for
me
though
to
go
out
a
night
like
this
feeling
as
i
do
mother
would
never
forgive
me
but
you
had
better
hurry
or
you
be
late
urged
heady
hurry
nothing
said
reddy
i
surprised
though
to
see
you
trying
to
pretend
that
you
sick
and
trying
to
send
me
out
on
a
terrible
night
like
this
when
you
i
really
sick
then
the
quarrel
waxed
fiercer
and
fiercer
until
they
quit
using
words
and
began
to
apply
hands
and
feet
it
was
not
many
minutes
before
each
had
kicked
the
other
out
of
bed
and
each
had
carried
half
of
the
bedclothing
with
him
neither
of
them
remained
any
longer
than
was
necessary
on
the
cold
floor
but
each
grabbed
up
his
half
of
the
bedding
and
rolled
himself
up
in
it
and
lay
down
with
great
dignity
as
far
away
from
the
other
as
he
could
get
even
though
he
hung
far
over
the
edge
but
the
covers
had
been
none
too
warm
all
together
and
now
divided
into
half
the
twins
were
soon
shivering
in
misery
they
stood
it
as
long
as
they
could
and
then
as
if
by
a
silent
agreement
they
decided
to
declare
a
peace
and
each
remarked
i
guess
we
both
too
sick
to
go
out
such
a
night
as
this
and
they
were
soon
asleep
again
when
punk
heard
the
his
heart
grew
bitter
at
the
thought
of
the
still
bitterer
night
he
did
not
think
it
proper
for
one
of
his
conservative
nature
to
violate
all
the
rules
of
health
and
by
going
out
in
such
rowdy
weather
he
peeked
over
the
edge
of
his
coverlet
and
saw
that
his
stove
was
still
glowing
and
that
his
own
room
was
not
on
fire
then
he
reached
out
one
quick
arm
and
pulled
his
slippers
into
bed
with
him
and
when
they
were
warm
enough
put
them
on
his
feet
wrapped
himself
up
well
and
running
to
the
window
raised
it
quickly
thrust
his
head
out
and
looked
up
and
down
the
campus
this
quick
glance
satisfied
him
of
two
things
first
that
none
of
the
beloved
academy
buildings
were
on
fire
and
second
that
he
was
never
much
interested
in
the
old
village
anyway
so
he
toddled
back
to
his
cozy
bed
was
sleeping
so
soundly
that
the
could
not
wake
him
it
simply
rang
in
his
ears
and
mingled
with
his
dreams
in
the
land
of
dreams
he
went
to
all
sorts
of
fires
and
saved
thirty
or
forty
lives
mainly
of
beautiful
maidens
in
top
stories
of
blazing
palaces
his
dreamland
rescues
were
as
heroic
as
any
one
could
desire
but
that
was
as
near
as
he
came
to
answering
the
call
of
the
kingston
alarm
as
for
sleepy
it
is
doubtful
if
the
bell
would
have
awakened
him
if
it
had
been
suspended
from
his
but
from
where
it
was
it
never
reached
even
to
his
dreams
if
indeed
even
dreams
could
have
wormed
their
way
into
his
solid
slumbers
tug
conscience
however
was
giving
him
a
sharper
pain
than
he
suffered
at
the
thought
of
the
night
outside
at
length
he
could
stand
the
thought
of
being
found
wanting
in
his
duty
no
longer
he
flung
himself
out
of
bed
and
into
his
clothes
his
teeth
beating
a
tattoo
his
knees
fighting
a
and
his
hands
all
thumbs
with
the
cold
then
he
put
on
two
pairs
of
trousers
three
coats
and
an
overcoat
two
caps
several
mufflers
and
a
pair
of
heavy
mittens
over
a
pair
of
gloves
and
flew
down
the
stairs
and
dived
out
into
the
storm
like
a
russian
taking
a
in
an
icy
stream
fairly
plowing
through
the
freezing
winds
along
the
cinder
paths
he
hurried
and
down
the
clattering
board
walks
of
the
village
to
the
building
of
the
fire
department
he
met
never
a
soul
upon
the
arctic
streets
and
he
found
never
a
soul
at
the
of
the
volunteers
what
amazed
him
most
was
that
he
found
not
even
a
man
there
to
ring
the
bell
the
rope
however
was
flouncing
about
in
the
wind
and
the
bell
itself
was
still
thundering
alarums
over
the
town
tug
first
thought
at
this
discovery
was
spooks
as
is
usual
with
people
who
do
not
believe
in
ghosts
they
were
the
first
things
he
thought
of
as
an
explanation
of
a
mysterious
performance
his
second
thought
was
the
right
one
the
hurricane
had
ripped
off
the
boarding
about
the
bell
and
the
wind
itself
was
the
with
a
sigh
of
the
utmost
tragedy
tug
turned
back
toward
his
room
he
was
colder
now
than
ever
and
by
the
time
he
reached
the
dormitory
he
was
too
nearly
frozen
to
stop
and
upbraid
punk
and
the
other
derelicts
who
had
proved
false
at
a
crisis
that
also
proved
false
the
next
morning
however
he
gathered
them
all
in
his
room
and
read
them
a
severe
lecture
they
had
been
a
disgrace
to
the
lakerim
ideal
he
insisted
and
they
had
only
luck
and
not
themselves
to
credit
for
the
fact
that
they
were
not
made
the
of
the
town
and
the
academy
and
that
day
the
sent
in
its
resignation
from
the
volunteer
fire
department
of
the
village
of
kingston
xvii
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
the
christmas
vacation
hove
in
sight
and
the
dozen
forgot
the
blot
upon
its
escutcheon
in
the
thought
of
the
delight
that
awaited
it
in
renewing
acquaintance
with
its
mothers
and
other
best
girls
at
lakerim
not
to
mention
the
cronies
in
the
each
had
his
plans
for
making
fourteen
days
out
of
the
two
weeks
they
were
to
spend
at
home
peaceful
thoughts
filled
the
hearts
of
most
of
them
but
dreamed
chiefly
of
the
furious
conflicts
that
awaited
him
on
the
lake
which
had
been
the
scene
of
many
an
adventure
in
his
mettlesome
the
last
days
crawled
painfully
by
for
all
of
them
and
the
dozen
grew
more
and
more
meek
as
they
became
more
and
more
homesick
for
their
mothers
they
were
boys
indeed
now
and
until
they
reached
the
old
town
but
there
there
was
such
a
cordial
reception
for
them
from
the
whole
village
fathers
mothers
brothers
sisters
best
girls
cronies
and
even
dogs
that
by
the
time
they
had
reached
the
which
had
been
built
by
their
own
efforts
and
in
which
they
were
recorded
on
a
beautiful
panel
as
the
charter
members
they
felt
that
they
were
aged
veterans
returning
to
some
where
they
were
indeed
famous
a
reception
was
given
in
their
honor
at
the
and
tug
made
a
speech
and
the
others
gave
various
more
or
less
ridiculous
and
impressive
exhibitions
of
their
grandeur
after
a
day
or
two
of
this
glory
however
they
became
with
the
rest
of
the
villagers
and
were
content
to
sit
around
the
and
tell
stories
of
the
grand
old
days
when
the
lakerim
athletic
club
had
no
to
cover
its
head
the
days
when
they
fought
so
hard
for
admission
to
the
interscholastic
league
of
academies
they
were
to
tell
the
truth
though
just
a
little
disappointed
in
the
inside
of
their
hearts
that
the
successors
left
behind
to
carry
on
the
club
were
doing
prosperously
winning
athletic
victories
and
paying
off
the
debt
in
fine
style
quite
as
well
as
if
they
themselves
had
been
there
the
most
popular
of
the
was
whose
favorite
and
most
successful
yarn
was
the
account
of
the
great
adventure
when
the
hockey
team
was
wrecked
upon
buzzard
rock
and
spent
the
night
in
the
with
the
blizzard
howling
outside
the
memory
of
that
terrible
escape
made
the
blood
run
cold
in
the
veins
of
the
other
members
of
the
club
but
it
aroused
in
only
a
new
and
irresistible
desire
to
be
off
again
upon
the
same
now
father
was
an
enthusiastic
sailor
fortunately
not
so
rash
a
sailor
as
his
son
but
quite
as
great
a
lover
of
a
flowing
sail
as
he
was
he
could
not
spend
a
winter
idly
and
turned
his
attention
to
he
owned
a
beautiful
modern
vessel
made
of
basswood
butternut
and
pine
with
rigging
all
of
steel
and
a
as
springy
as
an
umbrella
frame
she
carried
no
more
than
four
hundred
square
feet
of
sail
but
when
he
gave
her
the
whip
and
let
her
take
to
her
heels
she
outran
the
fleetest
wind
that
ever
swept
the
lake
and
she
skipped
and
sported
along
near
the
railroad
track
where
the
raced
in
vain
with
her
for
she
could
make
her
sixty
miles
an
hour
or
more
without
gasping
for
breath
she
was
named
now
father
had
ample
cause
to
be
suspicious
of
that
young
man
discretion
and
he
never
permitted
him
to
take
the
boat
out
alone
good
sailor
as
he
knew
his
son
to
be
so
had
to
content
himself
with
parties
of
boys
and
girls
hilarious
with
the
cold
and
speed
and
wrapped
up
tamely
in
great
blankets
under
the
charge
of
his
father
who
was
a
more
than
cautious
sailor
being
as
wise
as
he
was
old
and
seeing
the
foolishness
of
those
pleasures
which
depend
only
on
risking
bone
and
body
but
was
wretched
and
chafed
under
the
restraint
of
such
respectable
amusement
with
girls
too
and
when
in
the
midst
of
the
holidays
his
father
was
called
out
of
town
went
to
bed
and
could
hardly
fall
asleep
under
the
conspiracies
he
began
to
form
for
eloping
on
one
last
escapade
with
the
he
woke
soon
after
daybreak
the
next
morning
and
hurried
to
his
window
there
he
found
a
gale
of
wind
blowing
and
lashing
the
earth
with
a
furious
rain
the
wind
he
received
with
welcoming
heart
but
the
rain
sent
terror
there
for
it
told
him
that
the
ice
would
soon
disappear
and
he
would
be
sent
back
to
kingston
academy
with
never
a
chance
to
let
loose
the
it
is
now
or
never
mumbled
clenching
his
teeth
after
the
manner
of
all
desperados
xviii
he
sneaked
into
his
clothes
and
descended
the
cold
creaking
staircase
in
his
then
he
put
on
his
rubber
boots
and
stole
out
of
the
house
like
a
burglar
the
wind
would
have
wrecked
any
umbrella
alive
but
he
cared
naught
for
the
rain
and
hurried
down
the
street
where
the
twins
were
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
righteous
he
threw
pebbles
at
their
windows
till
they
were
awakened
and
after
a
proper
amount
of
deliberation
in
which
each
requested
the
other
to
go
to
the
window
both
went
hand
in
hand
on
their
shivering
toes
when
they
had
leaned
out
and
learned
what
invited
them
to
they
reminded
him
that
he
was
either
crazy
or
walking
in
his
sleep
but
answered
back
that
they
were
either
talking
in
their
sleep
or
were
cowardy
calves
the
worst
of
all
fools
is
the
one
that
is
afraid
to
take
a
dare
and
the
twins
were
well
let
us
say
they
were
not
yet
wide
enough
awake
to
know
what
they
were
doing
at
any
rate
they
could
not
stand
the
banter
of
and
had
soon
joined
him
in
the
soaking
storm
outside
when
the
lake
was
reached
the
twins
were
more
than
ever
convinced
that
was
more
than
ever
out
of
his
head
for
instead
of
the
smooth
mirror
they
had
been
accustomed
to
gliding
over
in
the
boat
they
found
that
the
ice
was
covered
with
an
inch
of
slush
and
water
the
sky
above
was
not
promising
and
blue
nor
did
the
wind
have
a
merry
whizz
but
it
laughed
like
a
maniac
and
shrieked
and
threatened
them
warning
them
to
go
back
home
or
take
most
dreadful
consequences
however
would
not
listen
to
the
advice
they
tendered
him
but
went
busily
about
getting
the
sails
up
and
preparing
the
boat
for
the
voyage
the
twins
were
still
pleading
with
to
have
some
regard
for
the
dictates
of
common
sense
when
he
began
to
haul
in
the
and
put
the
helm
down
and
they
had
barely
time
to
leap
aboard
before
the
boat
was
away
they
felt
indeed
that
they
were
sailing
in
a
regular
sloop
and
that
too
going
with
lee
rail
awash
for
instead
of
the
soft
crooning
sound
the
runners
made
usually
there
was
a
slash
and
a
swish
of
ripples
cloven
apart
and
instead
of
the
little
fountains
of
which
rise
from
the
heels
of
the
sharp
shoes
when
the
boat
is
skimming
the
frozen
surface
there
rose
long
spurting
sprays
of
water
the
twins
reproached
each
other
bitterly
for
coming
on
such
a
wild
venture
but
they
did
not
know
how
really
sorry
they
were
till
they
got
well
out
on
the
lake
where
the
wind
caught
them
with
full
force
and
proved
to
be
a
very
gale
of
fury
the
mast
writhed
and
squealed
and
the
sails
groaned
and
wrenched
as
if
they
would
fairly
rip
the
boat
apart
the
world
seemed
one
vast
vortex
of
hurricane
and
yet
for
all
the
wind
that
was
frightening
them
to
death
the
twins
seemed
to
find
it
impossible
to
get
enough
to
breathe
it
was
bitter
bitter
cold
too
and
reddy
hands
and
feet
reminded
him
only
of
the
bags
of
cracked
ice
they
put
on
his
forehead
once
when
he
had
a
severe
fever
however
was
as
happy
as
the
twins
were
miserable
and
he
yelled
and
shouted
in
ecstatic
glee
now
he
was
a
gang
of
at
a
now
he
was
a
band
of
apache
indians
circling
fiendishly
around
a
crew
of
those
inland
sailors
who
used
to
steer
their
across
the
west
before
the
twins
could
imagine
it
the
boat
had
reached
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
and
it
was
necessary
to
come
about
suddenly
the
skipper
had
thrown
her
head
into
the
wind
the
jib
and
mainsail
were
clattering
thunderously
and
the
boom
went
slashing
over
like
a
club
in
the
hands
of
a
giant
before
the
twins
had
dared
to
lift
their
heads
again
there
was
a
silence
and
the
sails
began
to
fill
and
the
boat
to
resume
her
speed
quickly
in
a
new
direction
in
a
moment
the
was
well
under
way
along
a
new
leg
and
sailing
as
close
as
could
hold
her
and
now
as
the
twins
glared
with
icy
eyeballs
into
the
mist
ahead
suddenly
they
both
made
out
a
thin
black
line
drawn
as
if
by
a
great
pencil
across
the
lake
in
front
of
them
watch
out
they
cried
we
are
coming
to
an
enormous
crack
hooray
for
the
crack
was
all
the
answer
they
got
from
the
intrepid
and
now
instead
of
their
rushing
toward
the
crack
it
seemed
to
be
flying
at
them
widening
like
the
jaws
of
a
terrible
dragon
but
the
was
as
fearless
and
as
gaily
jaunty
as
siegfried
straight
at
the
black
maw
with
bits
of
floating
ice
like
the
crunching
white
teeth
of
a
monster
the
boat
held
its
way
neatly
as
the
boy
pretty
ever
skimmed
a
hurdle
in
a
the
boat
skimmed
the
gulf
of
water
the
ice
bent
and
cracked
treacherously
and
the
water
flew
up
in
little
jets
where
it
broke
but
was
off
and
away
before
there
was
ever
a
chance
to
engulf
her
and
then
the
heart
of
the
twins
could
beat
again
the
boat
was
just
well
over
the
crack
when
she
struck
a
patch
of
rough
ice
and
yawed
suddenly
there
was
a
severe
wrench
and
reddy
were
prepared
for
it
but
heady
before
he
knew
what
was
the
matter
had
slid
off
the
boat
on
to
the
ice
and
on
a
long
tangent
into
the
crack
they
had
just
passed
he
let
out
a
yell
i
can
tell
you
and
clung
to
the
edge
of
the
brittle
ice
with
desperate
hands
he
thought
he
had
been
cold
before
but
as
he
clung
there
now
in
the
bitter
water
and
watched
trying
to
bring
the
obstinate
boat
about
and
come
alongside
he
thought
that
the
passengers
on
the
were
warm
as
in
any
turkish
bath
after
what
seemed
to
him
at
least
a
century
of
foolish
zigzagging
finally
got
the
boat
somewhere
near
the
miserable
heady
brought
the
to
a
standstill
and
threw
the
dripping
twin
the
then
he
hauled
him
out
upon
the
strong
ice
begged
heady
to
get
aboard
and
resume
the
journey
or
at
least
ride
back
home
but
heady
vowed
he
would
never
even
look
at
an
again
and
could
not
be
dissuaded
from
starting
off
at
a
across
the
lake
toward
home
reddy
wanted
to
get
out
and
follow
him
but
insisted
that
he
could
not
sail
the
boat
without
some
ballast
and
before
reddy
could
step
out
upon
the
ice
had
flung
the
sail
into
the
wind
again
and
was
off
with
his
kidnapped
prisoner
reddy
looked
disconsolately
after
the
wretched
heady
plowing
through
the
slush
homeward
until
his
twin
brother
disappeared
in
the
distance
then
he
began
to
implore
to
put
back
to
lakerim
finally
he
began
to
threaten
him
with
physical
force
if
he
did
not
fairly
giggled
at
the
thought
of
at
last
seeing
one
of
those
mutinies
he
had
read
so
much
about
but
he
contented
himself
with
having
a
great
deal
to
say
about
tacking
on
this
leg
and
on
that
and
about
how
many
points
he
could
sail
into
the
wind
and
a
lot
of
other
gibberish
that
kept
reddy
guessing
until
the
boat
had
gone
far
up
the
lake
at
last
to
reddy
infinite
delight
announced
that
he
was
going
to
turn
round
and
tack
home
as
they
came
about
they
gave
the
wind
full
sweep
the
sail
filled
with
a
roar
and
the
boat
leaped
away
like
an
athlete
at
a
and
now
their
speed
was
so
that
reddy
would
have
been
reminded
of
the
boy
ganymede
whom
jupiter
eagle
stole
and
flew
off
to
heaven
with
but
he
had
never
heard
of
that
unfortunate
youth
he
had
the
sense
of
flight
plainly
enough
though
and
it
terrified
him
beyond
all
the
previous
terrors
of
the
morning
as
i
have
said
before
different
persons
have
their
different
specialties
in
courage
as
in
everything
else
and
while
reddy
and
heady
were
brave
as
lads
could
well
be
in
some
ways
their
courage
lay
in
other
lines
than
in
running
dead
before
the
wind
in
a
madcap
on
uncertain
ice
the
wind
had
increased
too
since
they
first
started
out
and
now
it
was
a
young
and
hilarious
gale
it
began
to
wrench
the
windward
runner
clear
of
the
ice
and
bang
it
down
again
with
a
thud
in
fact
the
wind
began
to
batter
the
boat
about
so
much
that
decided
he
must
have
some
weight
upon
the
windward
runner
or
it
would
be
unmanageable
he
told
reddy
that
he
must
make
his
way
out
to
the
end
of
the
reddy
gave
one
suspicious
look
and
then
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
voice
no
thank
you
the
calm
and
joyful
now
proceeded
to
grow
very
much
excited
and
to
insist
he
told
reddy
that
he
must
go
out
upon
the
end
of
the
runner
or
the
boat
would
be
wrecked
and
both
of
them
possibly
killed
after
many
warnings
of
this
sort
the
disgusted
reddy
set
forth
upon
his
most
unpleasant
voyage
he
crept
tremblingly
along
the
narrow
backbone
until
he
reached
the
of
the
runner
there
he
grasped
a
and
made
his
way
step
by
step
along
the
jouncing
plank
to
the
end
where
he
wrapped
his
legs
around
the
wire
stay
and
held
on
for
dear
life
reddy
weight
gave
the
runner
steadiness
enough
to
reassure
though
poor
reddy
thought
it
was
the
most
unstable
platform
he
had
stood
upon
as
it
flung
and
bucked
and
shook
him
hither
and
yon
with
a
violence
that
knew
no
rest
or
regularity
but
uncomfortable
as
he
was
and
much
as
he
felt
like
a
seasick
balloonist
he
did
not
know
in
what
a
lucky
position
he
was
nor
how
happy
he
should
have
been
that
it
was
not
even
riskier
there
is
some
comfort
or
there
ought
to
be
in
the
fact
that
a
situation
is
never
so
bad
that
it
might
not
be
worse
was
now
so
well
satisfied
with
his
live
ballast
that
he
began
once
more
to
sing
and
make
a
mad
hullabaloo
of
pure
enjoyment
he
finally
grew
careless
and
forgot
himself
and
the
eternal
alertness
that
is
necessary
for
a
good
skipper
just
one
moment
he
let
his
mind
wander
and
that
moment
was
enough
the
boat
without
warning
to
either
or
reddy
jibed
reddy
now
more
than
ever
astounded
suddenly
found
himself
pitching
forward
in
the
air
and
slamming
on
the
ice
he
slid
along
it
for
a
hundred
feet
or
more
on
his
stomach
like
a
rocket
with
a
wake
of
spray
and
slush
for
a
tail
reddy
was
soaked
as
completely
as
if
he
had
fallen
into
a
and
his
face
and
hands
were
cut
and
bruised
in
the
bargain
but
his
feelings
his
mental
feelings
were
hurt
even
worse
than
his
flesh
as
for
the
reckless
though
he
was
not
so
badly
bruised
as
his
unfortunate
and
unwilling
guest
he
was
to
suffer
a
still
greater
torment
he
too
was
thrown
from
the
boat
into
the
slush
and
by
the
time
he
had
recovered
himself
the
yacht
was
well
away
from
the
hope
of
capture
but
that
wilful
boat
the
seemed
unwilling
to
let
off
her
tormentor
so
easily
for
the
astounded
glaring
at
her
as
she
ran
on
riderless
saw
her
come
upon
some
rough
ice
and
jolt
and
ditch
her
runner
and
veer
until
she
had
actually
made
a
and
was
heading
straight
for
him
all
this
remarkable
change
took
place
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
but
a
large
part
of
that
small
time
was
spent
by
in
absolute
amazement
at
the
curious
and
vicious
action
of
his
boat
then
as
the
yacht
began
to
bear
down
on
him
with
increasing
speed
he
made
a
dash
to
get
out
of
its
path
but
his
feet
slipped
on
the
wet
ice
and
he
could
make
no
headway
saw
immediately
that
one
of
two
things
was
very
sure
to
happen
and
he
could
not
see
how
either
of
them
would
result
in
anything
but
terrible
disaster
to
him
for
if
he
should
stand
still
the
would
strike
him
below
the
knee
and
break
both
his
legs
like
straws
besides
when
he
was
knocked
over
he
was
likely
to
be
struck
by
the
which
would
finish
him
completely
if
on
the
other
hand
he
tried
to
jump
into
the
air
and
escape
the
runner
he
stood
a
fine
chance
of
being
hit
on
the
head
by
the
boom
which
would
deal
a
blow
like
the
guard
of
an
before
these
two
sickening
probabilities
the
boy
paused
motionless
helpless
it
was
the
choice
of
or
fire
xix
decided
to
take
the
chances
of
a
battered
skull
rather
than
let
both
the
windward
runner
and
the
have
a
slash
at
him
he
gathered
himself
for
a
dive
into
the
air
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
leap
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
lifted
the
windward
runner
off
the
ice
at
least
two
feet
like
lightning
dropped
face
down
on
the
ice
and
the
boat
passed
harmlessly
over
him
the
runner
just
grazing
his
having
inflicted
what
seemed
to
it
to
be
punishment
enough
the
sailed
coquettishly
on
down
the
lake
and
finally
banged
into
a
dock
at
home
and
stopped
and
reddy
made
off
after
it
as
fast
as
they
could
on
the
slippery
ice
with
the
help
of
the
wind
at
their
backs
but
they
never
overtook
it
and
the
run
served
them
only
the
good
turn
of
warming
them
somewhat
and
thus
saving
them
from
all
the
dire
consequences
they
deserved
for
their
foolhardiness
when
reddy
reached
home
he
found
that
heady
had
preceded
him
both
were
put
to
bed
and
dosed
with
such
bitter
medicine
that
they
almost
forgot
the
miseries
they
had
had
upon
the
lake
but
it
was
many
a
day
before
they
would
consent
to
speak
to
when
they
saw
him
coming
they
crossed
the
street
with
great
dignity
and
if
he
spoke
to
them
they
seemed
stricken
with
a
sudden
deafness
troubles
did
not
end
with
his
return
home
for
somehow
or
other
the
escapade
with
the
reached
his
father
ears
and
it
is
reported
that
father
forgot
for
a
few
minutes
the
fact
that
his
son
was
now
a
dignified
academician
at
any
rate
took
his
meals
standing
for
a
day
or
two
and
he
could
not
explain
this
strange
whim
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
friends
every
member
of
the
dozen
realized
the
necessity
of
keeping
the
body
clean
if
he
would
be
a
successful
athlete
and
of
keeping
his
linen
and
clothes
comely
if
he
would
be
a
successful
gentleman
taken
altogether
the
twelve
were
exactly
what
could
be
called
neat
but
not
gaudy
but
presentable
as
all
of
them
were
there
was
none
that
took
so
much
pains
and
pride
in
the
elegances
of
dress
as
the
boy
pretty
who
won
his
title
from
his
fondness
for
being
what
the
others
sometimes
called
a
dude
but
he
was
such
a
vigorous
athletic
young
fellow
with
so
little
foolishness
about
his
that
the
name
did
not
carry
with
it
the
insult
it
usually
conveys
the
chief
offense
pretty
gave
to
the
less
careful
of
the
dozen
was
his
fondness
for
carrying
a
cane
a
practice
which
the
rest
of
the
boys
being
boys
did
not
affect
but
pretty
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
from
this
nor
from
any
of
his
other
foibles
by
ridicule
and
the
others
finally
gave
him
up
in
despair
when
he
went
to
kingston
there
was
a
new
audience
for
his
devotion
to
matters
of
dress
but
at
the
academy
it
was
considered
a
breach
of
respect
to
the
for
the
to
carry
canes
pretty
however
simply
sniffed
at
the
tradition
and
said
it
interest
him
at
all
finally
a
large
senior
vowed
he
would
crack
the
cane
in
pieces
over
pretty
head
if
necessary
pretty
heard
these
threats
and
was
prepared
for
the
man
when
the
fatal
moment
of
their
meeting
arrived
though
the
senior
was
much
bigger
than
pretty
the
lakerim
youth
did
not
run
at
least
he
ran
no
farther
than
was
necessary
to
clear
a
good
space
for
the
use
of
a
little
exercise
pretty
was
no
boxer
but
he
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
value
of
a
good
stout
cane
imagine
his
humiliation
then
when
he
found
in
the
first
place
that
the
crook
of
his
stick
had
caught
in
his
and
spoiled
one
good
blow
and
in
the
second
place
that
the
fine
strong
slash
he
meant
to
deliver
overhead
like
a
stroke
merely
landed
upon
the
upraised
arm
of
the
senior
and
had
its
whole
force
broken
pretty
then
had
the
bitter
misery
of
seeing
his
good
sword
wrenched
from
his
hand
and
broken
across
the
knee
of
the
senior
who
very
magnificently
told
him
that
he
must
never
appear
on
the
campus
again
with
a
pretty
was
overcome
with
embarrassment
at
the
outcome
of
his
innocent
foppery
and
of
his
short
vain
battle
and
he
was
the
of
the
seniors
for
a
whole
day
but
being
of
lakerim
mettle
and
metal
he
did
not
mean
to
let
one
defeat
mean
a
final
overthrow
he
told
the
rest
of
the
lakerimmers
that
he
would
carry
a
cane
anyway
and
carry
it
anywhere
he
pleased
and
that
the
next
man
who
attempted
to
take
it
from
him
would
be
likely
to
get
mussed
up
about
this
time
he
found
a
magazine
article
that
told
the
proper
sort
of
cane
to
carry
and
the
proper
way
to
use
it
in
case
of
attack
and
he
proceeded
to
read
and
profit
now
inasmuch
as
was
working
his
way
through
the
academy
and
paying
his
own
expenses
without
assistance
except
from
what
small
earnings
he
could
make
himself
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
always
be
the
one
who
always
had
a
little
money
to
lend
to
the
other
fellows
though
they
had
their
funds
from
home
it
was
now
pretty
who
came
to
him
for
the
advance
of
cash
enough
to
buy
a
of
the
following
superb
description
a
thoroughly
even
bit
of
tapered
like
a
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
at
the
butt
and
three
fourths
of
an
inch
thick
at
the
point
the
butt
carrying
a
knob
of
silver
and
the
point
heavily
ferruled
pretty
had
managed
to
find
such
a
stick
in
the
small
stores
of
lakerim
he
bought
it
with
money
and
he
practised
his
exercises
with
it
so
vigorously
and
so
secretly
that
when
he
next
appeared
upon
the
campus
and
carried
it
the
senior
who
had
attacked
him
before
let
him
go
by
without
any
hindrance
he
was
fairly
stupefied
at
the
impudence
of
this
lakerimmer
whom
he
thought
he
had
thrashed
so
soundly
he
did
not
know
that
the
main
characteristic
of
the
lakerimmer
is
this
he
does
not
know
when
he
is
whipped
or
if
he
does
know
it
he
will
not
stay
whipped
but
once
he
had
recovered
his
senses
the
haughty
senior
did
not
lose
much
time
in
making
another
onslaught
on
pretty
when
some
of
his
friends
were
pouring
cold
water
on
this
bruised
head
a
few
minutes
later
he
poured
cold
water
on
their
scheme
to
attempt
to
carry
out
what
he
had
failed
in
for
he
said
do
you
ever
go
up
against
that
lakerim
fellow
his
cane
works
like
a
gatling
gun
so
pretty
was
permitted
to
carry
his
cane
and
though
he
swaggered
a
little
perhaps
no
further
attempt
was
made
by
the
seniors
to
take
the
stick
away
from
him
they
had
to
content
themselves
with
trying
to
throw
water
on
him
from
upper
windows
but
their
aim
was
bad
xx
pretty
had
not
been
home
long
on
his
christmas
vacation
before
he
called
at
the
home
of
the
beautiful
girl
enid
who
had
helped
him
win
so
many
tennis
games
and
who
was
the
best
of
all
the
best
girls
he
devoted
himself
to
either
in
kingston
lakerim
or
any
other
of
the
towns
he
blessed
with
his
smiling
presence
enid
and
pretty
being
great
lovers
of
fresh
air
took
many
a
long
walk
on
the
country
roads
about
lakerim
one
day
when
the
air
was
as
exhilarating
and
as
electric
as
the
bubbles
in
a
glass
of
soda
they
took
a
much
longer
stroll
than
usual
then
they
made
a
sudden
decision
to
turn
homeward
for
rounding
a
sharp
bend
in
the
road
they
saw
coming
toward
them
three
burly
tramps
at
the
sight
of
these
three
graces
both
pretty
and
enid
stopped
short
in
some
little
uneasiness
the
tramps
also
stopped
short
and
seemed
to
engage
in
a
conversation
about
the
two
young
people
ahead
of
them
on
the
road
pretty
on
account
of
the
extreme
neatness
of
his
costume
often
got
credit
for
being
a
much
richer
lad
than
he
was
and
enid
also
was
as
careful
and
as
successful
in
her
costumery
as
pretty
so
the
three
tramps
probably
thought
they
had
before
them
two
children
of
wealth
who
would
be
amply
provided
with
but
if
they
had
only
known
how
little
the
two
really
had
in
their
possession
the
adventure
you
are
about
to
hear
would
never
have
happened
but
while
pretty
was
flicking
the
dirt
at
the
end
of
his
toe
with
his
and
wondering
if
he
really
cared
to
go
any
farther
the
tramps
moved
toward
him
quickly
enid
being
a
girl
was
frightened
and
did
not
try
to
conceal
it
but
said
oh
pretty
let
go
home
at
once
pretty
being
a
boy
thought
he
must
make
a
display
of
courage
even
if
he
did
feel
it
so
while
his
heart
clattered
away
in
his
breast
and
he
could
hardly
find
breath
to
speak
he
said
with
some
show
of
composure
yes
enid
i
think
we
have
walked
far
enough
for
then
they
whirled
about
and
started
for
home
at
a
good
gait
they
had
not
gone
far
when
enid
glancing
back
over
her
shoulder
noticed
that
the
tramps
were
coming
up
at
a
still
more
rapid
walk
one
of
them
indeed
called
out
in
a
suspiciously
friendly
tone
hey
young
feller
hold
up
a
minute
and
tell
us
what
time
it
is
will
ye
enid
gasped
let
run
pretty
come
on
but
pretty
answered
with
much
dignity
run
what
for
and
he
turned
and
called
back
to
the
tramp
i
know
what
time
it
is
then
the
tramps
insisted
again
that
pretty
wait
for
them
to
come
up
but
when
he
continued
to
walk
without
answering
them
they
began
to
hurl
oaths
and
rocks
and
to
run
toward
him
now
pretty
thought
that
discretion
was
the
better
half
of
valor
and
he
seized
enid
wrist
and
started
off
on
a
run
an
act
in
which
she
was
willing
enough
to
follow
his
lead
but
he
had
to
explain
just
to
preserve
his
dignity
they
three
to
one
you
know
but
while
enid
understood
well
enough
the
necessity
for
speed
she
had
no
breath
to
expend
expressing
her
appreciation
of
pretty
delicate
position
she
was
too
frightened
to
run
even
as
well
as
she
knew
how
and
she
was
going
at
a
gait
that
was
neither
very
fast
nor
very
economical
of
muscle
and
breath
pretty
however
ran
scientifically
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
with
his
head
erect
his
chest
out
and
his
lips
tightly
locked
but
before
long
he
was
doing
all
the
work
for
two
and
laboring
like
a
ship
that
drags
its
anchor
in
a
storm
they
came
to
a
hill
now
and
here
enid
leaned
her
whole
weight
upon
him
he
barely
managed
with
the
most
tremendous
determination
and
exertion
to
get
her
to
the
top
of
this
long
incline
as
they
labored
up
he
decided
in
his
own
mind
and
told
her
that
she
must
leave
him
and
run
on
for
help
just
one
tenth
of
a
second
his
terrified
mind
had
been
occupied
with
the
thought
that
he
might
run
on
alone
and
leave
her
the
tempting
idea
of
had
whispered
to
him
that
if
he
stayed
behind
it
would
only
result
in
disaster
to
two
while
if
he
ran
on
alone
at
least
one
would
be
saved
but
this
cowardly
selfishness
he
put
away
after
the
tenth
of
a
second
of
thought
and
now
he
was
insisting
even
against
enid
gasping
objection
that
she
must
run
on
alone
and
leave
him
to
take
care
of
the
footpads
he
did
not
know
how
he
was
going
to
do
this
but
he
felt
that
upon
him
devolved
the
duty
of
being
the
zealous
to
cover
the
retreat
of
a
vanquished
army
enid
however
was
stubborn
and
proposed
to
stay
and
fight
with
him
even
drawing
out
a
very
sharp
and
very
dangerous
to
emphasize
her
courage
but
pretty
while
he
blessed
her
for
her
bravery
and
her
still
commanded
her
to
run
on
and
bring
help
promising
her
that
he
would
keep
out
of
harm
way
till
help
could
come
with
this
assurance
the
poor
girl
staggered
on
gaining
strength
from
the
necessity
of
speed
to
save
her
beloved
pretty
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
pretty
found
himself
alone
and
turned
and
looked
at
the
trio
with
defiant
sternness
after
a
moment
which
gave
him
some
rest
and
a
chance
to
gain
new
breath
he
realized
that
one
half
a
battle
is
with
the
warrior
that
is
wise
enough
to
make
the
first
onslaught
so
after
a
tremor
of
very
natural
hesitation
the
boy
dashed
full
at
the
three
hulkish
tramps
xxi
the
overgrown
brutes
were
so
much
taken
aback
at
the
change
of
front
on
the
part
of
the
young
fellow
whom
they
had
hoped
to
run
down
like
a
scared
rabbit
that
they
stopped
short
in
sheer
surprise
but
this
was
only
for
a
moment
then
the
leader
of
the
three
rushed
forward
with
a
large
club
he
carried
it
high
in
the
air
in
the
same
indiscreet
manner
in
which
pretty
had
once
attacked
the
senior
just
before
the
tramp
and
the
boy
came
to
close
quarters
pretty
made
a
diving
sidelong
dodge
and
as
the
tramp
club
whisked
idly
through
the
air
past
him
he
dealt
the
fellow
a
furious
blow
across
the
left
shin
now
as
any
one
who
was
ever
struck
there
knows
a
man
shin
is
as
tender
as
a
bear
nose
and
the
surprised
tramp
was
soon
dancing
about
in
the
air
hugging
his
bruised
leg
and
yowling
like
a
wildcat
but
pretty
had
run
on
past
leaving
him
to
his
misery
now
he
came
up
to
the
other
two
who
moved
in
single
file
toward
him
the
first
man
pretty
received
right
upon
the
point
of
his
cane
driving
the
hard
metal
ferrule
straight
at
the
man
solar
plexus
the
combination
of
the
man
rush
and
pretty
powerful
thrust
was
enough
to
lay
the
wretch
upon
the
ground
writhing
and
almost
unconscious
for
the
last
thug
pretty
had
prepared
a
beautiful
slash
across
the
face
but
the
villain
seeing
what
was
in
store
for
him
dropped
down
and
rushed
at
the
boy
low
enough
to
evade
the
stick
pretty
however
had
a
check
for
this
move
also
and
a
quick
step
to
one
side
saved
him
from
the
man
clutch
now
he
recovered
himself
quickly
enough
to
deliver
a
vicious
whack
straight
at
the
back
of
the
man
head
a
blow
that
would
have
settled
the
tramp
mind
for
some
time
to
come
but
the
fellow
was
running
so
fast
that
pretty
missed
his
aim
and
his
stout
weapon
only
dealt
a
stinging
blow
upon
the
man
left
shoulder
the
thug
ran
on
far
enough
to
gain
a
good
and
then
whirling
came
at
pretty
again
now
his
uplifted
hand
held
an
ugly
knife
the
look
of
this
was
not
pleasant
to
pretty
eyes
but
the
excitement
of
the
situation
was
much
increased
when
a
glance
out
of
the
side
of
his
eye
showed
him
that
the
first
thug
had
regained
enough
nerve
to
come
limping
forward
in
the
endeavor
to
throttle
him
the
men
were
not
coming
at
him
in
such
a
way
that
he
could
use
the
thrust
that
he
had
learned
for
such
occasions
so
he
decided
instantly
to
repeat
upon
the
first
thug
the
blow
that
had
been
so
successful
before
as
the
man
came
on
then
pretty
gave
a
terrific
backward
slash
that
caught
the
tramp
uninjured
shin
it
was
a
beauteous
shot
and
sent
the
fellow
to
his
hunkers
actually
boohooing
with
agony
and
now
with
another
fine
long
sweep
this
time
upward
pretty
sent
a
smashing
blow
at
the
third
tramp
upraised
arm
the
force
of
the
stroke
was
alone
strong
enough
to
send
the
knife
flying
but
by
the
addition
of
a
bit
of
good
luck
pretty
caught
the
wretch
on
his
crazy
bone
and
set
him
to
such
a
caterwauling
as
cats
sing
of
midnights
on
a
fence
leaving
the
battered
three
graces
to
their
different
dances
pretty
picked
up
the
knife
he
had
knocked
from
the
hand
of
the
third
and
sauntered
homeward
adjusting
his
somewhat
ruffled
collar
and
tie
as
he
went
with
magnificent
on
his
way
he
met
the
party
of
rescuers
sent
to
him
by
enid
who
had
managed
to
reach
town
in
rapid
time
pretty
calmly
sent
them
back
to
pick
up
the
three
tramps
he
had
left
and
these
gentlemen
were
stowed
away
in
the
lakerim
jail
where
they
cracked
rock
and
thought
of
their
cracked
bones
till
long
after
pretty
christmas
vacation
was
over
as
for
enid
i
will
leave
you
to
guess
whether
or
no
she
thought
pretty
the
greatest
hero
of
his
age
or
any
age
and
whether
or
no
she
gossiped
his
bravery
all
around
lakerim
long
after
the
dozen
were
away
again
in
kingston
xxii
the
night
before
the
lakerim
contingent
went
back
to
the
kingston
academy
another
grand
reception
was
given
in
their
honor
at
the
and
the
dozen
made
more
speeches
and
assumed
an
air
of
greater
magnificence
than
ever
but
nevertheless
they
were
just
a
trifle
sorry
that
they
had
to
leave
their
old
happy
but
there
was
some
consolation
in
the
thought
that
the
life
at
the
academy
would
not
be
one
glittering
revel
of
studies
and
classes
for
the
dozen
believed
as
it
believed
nothing
else
that
all
play
and
no
work
makes
jack
a
dull
boy
the
general
average
of
the
dozen
in
the
matter
of
studies
was
satisfactory
enough
for
while
sleepy
was
always
at
the
bottom
of
his
classes
and
probably
the
laziest
and
stupidest
of
all
the
students
at
kingston
history
was
certainly
at
the
head
of
his
classes
and
probably
the
most
brilliant
of
all
the
students
at
kingston
with
these
two
at
the
opposite
poles
the
rest
of
the
dozen
worked
more
or
less
hard
and
faithfully
and
kept
a
very
decent
pace
but
the
average
attainment
of
the
dozen
in
the
field
of
athletics
was
far
more
than
satisfactory
it
was
brilliant
for
while
there
was
one
man
history
who
was
not
quite
the
athlete
of
the
universe
and
was
not
good
at
anything
more
muscular
than
chess
and
golf
the
eleven
others
had
each
his
specialty
and
his
numerous
interests
they
believed
athletically
in
knowing
everything
about
something
and
something
about
everything
the
winter
went
blustering
along
piling
up
snows
and
melting
them
again
only
to
pile
up
more
again
and
the
wind
raved
in
very
uncertain
humors
but
snow
or
thaw
the
dozen
was
never
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
finally
january
was
gone
and
february
that
month
was
dawdling
along
its
way
toward
that
great
occasion
which
gives
it
its
chief
excuse
for
being
on
the
calendar
washington
birthday
from
time
immemorial
it
had
been
the
custom
at
kingston
to
celebrate
the
natal
anniversary
of
the
father
of
his
country
with
all
sorts
of
disgraceful
rioting
and
cavorting
the
lakerim
twelve
were
not
the
ones
to
throw
the
weight
of
their
influence
against
any
traditions
that
might
add
dignity
to
the
excitements
of
life
of
the
part
they
took
in
raising
the
flag
on
the
tower
of
the
chapel
and
in
defending
that
flag
and
in
tearing
down
a
dummy
raised
in
their
colors
by
the
crows
in
the
public
square
of
the
village
of
this
and
many
other
delightfully
improper
pranks
there
is
no
room
to
tell
here
and
you
must
rest
content
with
hearing
of
the
important
athletic
affair
the
affair
which
more
truly
and
fittingly
celebrated
the
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
this
great
man
who
was
himself
one
of
the
finest
specimens
of
manhood
and
one
of
the
best
athletes
our
country
has
ever
known
the
athletic
association
from
a
neighboring
school
known
as
the
brownsville
school
for
boys
had
sent
the
kingstonians
an
offer
to
bring
along
a
team
of
runners
to
scour
the
regions
around
kingston
in
competition
with
any
team
kingston
would
put
forth
the
challenge
was
cordially
accepted
at
once
and
the
brownsville
people
sent
over
john
orton
the
best
of
their
runners
to
look
over
a
course
two
days
in
advance
and
decide
upon
the
path
along
which
he
should
lead
his
team
it
was
agreed
that
the
course
should
be
between
six
and
eight
miles
long
the
runners
should
start
from
the
kingston
gymnasium
and
report
successively
at
the
macomb
which
was
some
distance
out
of
kingston
and
was
cut
off
by
numerous
ditches
and
gullies
then
at
the
railway
junction
two
miles
out
of
kingston
then
at
a
certain
little
red
and
then
at
the
finish
in
front
of
the
campus
it
was
agreed
that
the
two
teams
should
start
in
different
directions
and
touch
at
these
points
in
the
reverse
order
each
captain
was
allowed
to
choose
his
own
course
and
take
such
short
cuts
as
he
would
the
three
points
being
especially
chosen
with
a
view
to
keeping
the
men
off
the
road
and
giving
them
plenty
of
and
of
all
sorts
the
race
was
to
have
been
run
off
in
the
afternoon
but
the
train
was
late
and
the
brownsvillers
did
not
arrive
until
just
before
supper
it
was
decided
after
a
solemn
conference
that
the
race
should
be
run
in
spite
of
the
delay
and
as
soon
as
the
supper
had
had
a
ghost
of
a
chance
to
digest
the
rising
of
a
full
and
resplendent
moon
was
a
promise
that
the
runners
should
not
be
entirely
in
the
dark
tug
and
the
brownsville
chief
orton
had
made
careful
surveys
of
the
course
they
were
to
run
over
it
was
as
new
to
tug
as
to
the
brownsville
man
each
of
the
two
had
planned
his
own
short
cuts
and
even
if
they
had
been
running
over
the
course
in
the
same
direction
they
would
have
separated
almost
immediately
but
when
the
that
sent
them
off
in
different
directions
rang
out
they
were
standing
back
to
back
and
did
not
know
anything
of
each
whereabouts
until
they
met
again
face
to
face
at
the
end
of
the
course
the
teams
consisted
of
five
men
each
the
only
lakerim
men
on
the
kingston
team
were
tug
the
chief
who
had
been
a
great
runner
of
races
and
who
had
won
the
event
on
various
the
other
three
were
stage
bloss
and
macmanus
all
of
them
were
stocky
runners
and
inured
to
hardship
they
had
come
out
of
the
gymnasium
in
their
bathrobes
and
when
the
signal
to
start
was
given
the
spectators
in
their
warm
overcoats
felt
chills
scampering
up
and
down
their
ribs
as
they
noticed
that
all
the
men
of
both
teams
when
they
had
thrown
off
their
stood
clad
only
in
short
and
jerseys
but
their
heat
was
to
come
from
within
and
once
they
were
started
cold
was
the
least
of
their
trials
the
two
teams
broke
away
from
each
other
at
the
gymnasium
and
bolted
at
a
wide
angle
straight
across
the
campus
they
all
took
the
first
fence
in
perfect
form
as
if
they
were
thoroughbred
hunters
racing
after
a
fox
quiz
and
one
or
two
other
of
the
bicycle
enthusiasts
attempted
to
follow
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
packs
but
they
avoided
the
road
so
completely
that
the
bicyclists
soon
lost
them
from
sight
and
returned
to
watch
the
finish
the
method
of
awarding
the
victory
was
this
the
different
runners
were
to
be
checked
off
as
they
passed
the
different
stages
of
the
course
and
crossed
off
as
they
came
across
the
each
man
was
thus
given
the
number
of
his
place
in
the
finish
and
the
total
of
the
numbers
earned
by
each
team
decided
the
match
the
team
having
the
smaller
number
winning
thus
the
first
man
in
added
the
number
to
the
total
score
of
his
side
while
the
last
man
in
added
to
his
tug
had
explained
to
his
runners
before
they
started
out
that
was
what
would
count
that
he
wished
his
men
to
keep
together
and
that
they
were
to
take
their
orders
all
from
him
after
the
first
enthusiasm
of
a
good
brisk
start
to
get
steam
and
interest
up
tug
slowed
his
pace
down
to
such
a
gait
as
he
thought
could
be
comfortably
maintained
through
the
course
the
brownsville
leader
orton
however
being
a
brilliant
runner
himself
set
his
men
too
fierce
a
pace
and
soon
had
upon
his
hands
a
pack
of
breathless
stragglers
tug
vigorously
silenced
any
attempt
at
conversation
among
his
men
and
advised
them
to
save
their
breath
for
a
time
soon
to
come
when
they
would
need
it
badly
his
path
led
into
a
heavy
woods
very
gloomy
under
the
dim
moonlight
and
he
had
many
an
occasion
to
yell
with
pain
and
surprise
as
a
low
branch
stung
him
across
the
head
but
all
he
permitted
himself
to
exclaim
was
a
warning
cry
to
the
others
low
bridge
the
grove
was
so
blind
save
for
the
little
clearing
at
roden
knoll
which
tug
and
recognized
with
a
groan
of
pride
that
the
men
shins
were
barked
and
their
ankles
turned
at
almost
every
other
step
it
seemed
but
tug
would
not
permit
any
of
them
the
luxury
of
complaint
in
time
they
were
out
of
the
wood
and
into
the
open
but
here
it
seemed
that
their
troubles
only
increased
for
where
the
main
difficulty
in
the
forest
was
to
avoid
obstacles
the
chief
trouble
in
the
plain
was
to
conquer
them
there
were
many
fences
to
crawl
through
the
points
clutching
the
bare
skin
and
tearing
it
painfully
at
various
spots
the
huge
suffered
most
from
these
barbs
but
he
only
gasped
i
punctured
there
were
long
steep
hills
to
scramble
up
and
to
jolt
down
there
were
little
gullies
to
leap
over
and
brooks
to
cross
on
watery
that
frequently
betrayed
the
feet
into
icy
water
after
vaulting
gaily
over
one
rail
fence
and
scooting
jauntily
along
across
a
wide
pasture
the
kingstonians
were
surprised
to
hear
the
sound
of
other
footsteps
than
theirs
and
they
turned
and
found
a
large
and
enthusiastic
bull
endeavoring
to
join
their
select
circle
perhaps
this
bovine
gentleman
was
after
all
their
very
best
friend
for
nowhere
along
the
whole
course
did
they
attain
such
a
burst
of
speed
as
then
indeed
none
of
the
five
could
remember
a
time
in
his
life
when
he
made
such
a
spurt
they
reached
and
scaled
a
stone
wall
however
in
time
to
shake
off
the
company
of
this
inhospitable
host
in
the
next
field
there
were
two
or
three
skittish
colts
which
they
scared
into
all
manner
of
hysterical
behavior
as
they
sped
across
down
a
country
lane
they
turned
for
a
short
distance
and
a
farmer
and
his
wife
returning
home
from
a
church
sociable
on
seeing
these
five
white
figures
flit
past
in
a
minimum
of
clothing
thereafter
always
vowed
that
they
had
seen
ghosts
as
the
runners
trailed
past
a
with
never
a
light
to
show
upon
its
front
there
was
a
ferocious
hullabaloo
something
between
the
angry
snorting
of
a
buffalo
and
the
puffing
of
a
railroad
engine
going
up
a
steep
grade
it
was
the
wolfish
welcome
of
three
canine
brigands
the
bloodthirsty
that
surrounded
and
guarded
this
lonely
and
little
from
the
approach
of
any
one
or
those
dogs
must
have
been
very
sorry
they
spoke
for
when
they
came
rushing
forward
cordially
to
take
a
few
souvenir
bites
out
of
the
lakerim
team
tug
and
the
others
stopped
short
and
turned
toward
them
load
cried
tug
and
every
mother
son
of
the
five
picked
up
three
or
four
large
rocks
from
the
road
aim
cried
tug
and
every
father
son
of
the
five
drew
back
a
strong
and
willing
arm
fire
cried
tug
and
every
grandfather
and
grandmother
grandson
of
the
five
let
fly
with
a
will
the
rocks
his
hands
had
found
upon
the
road
those
dogs
must
have
felt
that
they
were
caught
out
in
the
heaviest
of
their
whole
experience
their
blustering
mood
disappeared
in
an
instant
and
they
turned
for
home
yelping
like
frightened
puppies
nor
did
they
forget
like
sheep
to
take
their
tails
with
them
neatly
tucked
between
their
legs
past
as
the
dogs
ran
in
one
direction
the
humans
ran
in
the
opposite
now
that
they
were
on
a
good
pike
road
some
of
them
were
disposed
to
sprint
particularly
the
stage
who
could
far
outrun
tug
or
any
of
the
team
but
tug
thought
that
wisdom
lay
in
keeping
his
team
well
in
hand
and
he
did
not
approve
of
running
on
in
advance
any
more
than
he
approved
of
straggling
thus
the
enthusiastic
stage
rejoicing
in
his
airy
heels
suddenly
found
himself
deserted
tug
having
seen
fit
to
leave
the
road
for
a
short
cut
across
the
fields
and
stage
had
to
run
back
fifty
yards
or
more
and
spend
most
of
his
surplus
energy
in
catching
up
with
the
team
it
was
a
merry
chase
tug
led
his
weary
crew
through
one
rough
ravine
where
the
hillside
flowed
out
from
under
their
feet
and
followed
them
down
and
where
they
must
climb
the
other
side
on
slippery
earth
grasping
at
a
rock
here
and
a
root
there
then
through
one
little
strip
of
forest
that
offered
him
an
cut
here
again
he
silenced
the
protests
of
his
men
at
the
thick
underbrush
and
the
frequent
brambles
they
encountered
just
at
the
edge
of
this
little
grove
tug
put
on
an
extra
burst
of
speed
and
was
running
like
the
wind
the
others
following
to
the
best
of
their
ability
saw
him
about
to
pass
between
two
harmless
posts
suddenly
they
also
saw
him
throw
up
his
hands
and
fall
over
backward
when
they
reached
him
they
saw
that
he
had
run
into
a
fence
in
the
dark
xxiii
they
were
doubly
dismayed
now
because
they
not
only
had
lost
their
leader
but
were
themselves
lost
in
some
part
of
the
country
where
they
knew
neither
the
landmarks
nor
the
points
of
the
compass
they
helped
tug
cautiously
to
his
feet
and
for
lack
of
a
better
medicine
rubbed
snow
upon
the
ugly
slashes
in
his
breast
and
legs
this
ends
the
race
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
moaned
bloss
but
tug
had
recovered
enough
from
his
dizziness
to
shake
his
head
and
mane
and
cry
not
much
come
on
boys
and
before
the
restraining
hand
of
could
stop
him
tug
had
somehow
wormed
himself
through
the
fence
and
was
off
across
the
open
and
they
were
sore
put
to
it
to
catch
up
with
him
again
suddenly
as
the
devoted
four
followed
their
leader
the
first
station
the
at
which
they
were
to
report
loomed
unexpectedly
upon
the
horizon
approached
in
some
unknown
way
by
tug
who
was
threading
his
way
through
the
wilderness
with
more
regard
for
straight
lines
than
for
progress
they
were
named
off
as
they
flew
past
by
a
watcher
stationed
there
and
without
pause
they
made
off
toward
the
railroad
junction
once
they
thought
they
saw
a
few
fleeting
forms
in
the
distance
and
they
guessed
that
they
must
be
orton
and
his
brownsville
team
but
they
could
not
feel
sure
and
no
closer
sight
of
their
rivals
was
vouchsafed
to
them
when
the
last
station
the
little
red
had
been
passed
they
began
to
feel
that
there
was
some
hope
of
their
reaching
home
they
began
also
to
feel
the
effect
of
their
long
hard
journey
their
sides
hurt
them
sorely
their
legs
ached
and
their
breath
came
faster
than
they
wished
macmanus
now
showed
more
serious
signs
of
weakening
than
any
of
the
rest
he
straggled
along
the
way
with
feet
that
seemed
to
get
into
each
other
path
and
with
a
head
that
wabbled
uncertainly
on
his
drooping
shoulders
tug
fell
back
and
ran
alongside
him
trying
to
console
and
encourage
him
to
better
speed
macmanus
responded
to
this
plea
with
a
spurt
and
suddenly
broke
away
from
the
four
and
ran
wildly
ahead
with
the
speed
of
desperation
he
came
upon
a
little
brook
frozen
across
with
a
thin
sheet
of
ice
here
he
found
a
log
that
seemed
to
have
been
placed
either
providentially
or
by
some
human
being
to
serve
as
a
macmanus
leaped
gaily
on
it
to
cross
the
stream
ahead
of
the
rest
to
his
breathless
dismay
the
log
turned
under
his
foot
and
wildly
as
he
tried
to
get
a
good
grip
on
the
atmosphere
nothing
could
save
him
and
he
went
and
through
the
thin
ice
into
the
water
now
he
was
indeed
willing
to
run
without
any
more
coaxing
than
the
bitter
air
upon
his
wet
skin
his
only
hope
of
getting
warm
was
in
his
heels
and
he
ran
like
a
maniac
till
tug
and
the
rest
must
put
on
extra
force
also
or
leave
him
completely
almost
before
they
knew
it
now
they
were
on
the
outskirts
of
kingston
village
their
arrival
at
the
beginning
of
the
home
stretch
was
signaled
in
a
very
startling
manner
for
tug
who
had
regained
the
lead
saw
ahead
of
him
a
bright
shining
strip
that
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
little
frozen
stream
under
the
moonlight
he
did
not
care
to
risk
stepping
on
any
more
thin
ice
so
he
gave
the
quick
command
jump
and
he
jumped
followed
almost
immediately
by
his
devoted
attendants
the
next
thing
they
all
knew
they
were
in
mud
up
to
their
knees
the
bright
patch
they
had
supposed
to
be
a
brook
was
a
sidewalk
and
they
had
carefully
jumped
over
the
sidewalk
into
the
mire
beyond
tug
was
disgusted
but
not
disheartened
and
he
had
his
crew
under
way
again
instantly
he
kept
up
his
system
of
short
cuts
even
now
that
they
were
in
town
he
led
them
over
back
fences
through
orchards
and
scattering
a
noisy
flock
of
hens
in
one
place
and
stirring
up
a
more
dogs
in
another
the
true
home
stretch
was
a
long
downhill
run
straight
to
the
goal
by
the
time
they
reached
this
macmanus
was
once
more
in
bad
shape
and
going
very
unsteadily
as
they
cleared
the
brow
of
the
hill
tug
anxious
heart
was
pierced
with
the
fear
that
he
had
lost
the
long
racking
race
after
all
for
just
crossing
the
stake
at
the
finish
he
caught
a
sight
of
orton
the
rest
of
the
team
saw
the
same
disheartening
spectacle
and
macmanus
eager
for
any
excuse
to
stop
running
gasped
they
beaten
us
there
no
use
running
any
farther
but
tug
having
lakerim
ideals
in
mind
would
never
say
die
he
squandered
just
breath
enough
to
exclaim
we
not
beaten
till
the
last
man
crosses
the
line
and
he
added
stage
run
for
your
life
and
stage
ran
oh
but
it
was
fine
to
see
that
lad
run
he
fled
forward
like
a
stag
with
the
hounds
in
full
cry
after
him
he
wasted
not
an
ounce
of
energy
but
ran
cleanly
and
straightly
and
splendidly
he
had
the
of
a
thoroughbred
trotter
and
his
running
was
as
beautiful
as
it
was
swift
run
all
of
you
for
your
lives
cried
tug
and
at
that
the
weary
little
band
sprang
forward
with
a
new
lease
on
strength
and
determination
tug
had
no
ambition
like
orton
to
leave
his
men
to
find
their
own
way
rather
he
herded
them
up
and
urged
them
on
as
a
scotch
collie
drives
home
the
sheep
at
a
canter
orton
runners
were
tailed
out
for
more
than
half
a
mile
behind
him
he
himself
was
easily
the
first
man
home
but
stage
beat
his
second
man
in
and
bloss
was
a
good
third
orton
ran
back
frantically
now
to
coax
his
last
three
men
he
hurried
in
his
third
runner
at
a
fairly
good
gait
but
before
he
could
get
him
to
the
line
tug
had
brought
forward
his
last
three
men
well
up
macmanus
going
doggedly
and
leaning
mentally
if
not
physically
on
tug
who
ran
at
his
side
by
thus
hurling
in
three
men
at
once
tug
made
an
enormous
inroad
upon
the
score
of
the
brownsvillers
besides
though
orton
got
his
man
in
soon
after
tug
the
last
brownsviller
did
not
come
along
for
a
minute
afterward
he
had
been
left
to
make
his
way
along
unaided
and
unguided
and
he
hardly
deserved
the
laughter
that
greeted
him
as
he
came
over
the
line
thus
orton
too
ambitious
had
brought
his
team
in
with
this
score
total
while
tug
men
well
bunched
at
the
finish
came
in
with
this
score
tug
richly
deserved
the
cheers
and
enthusiasm
that
greeted
his
management
for
in
spite
of
a
team
of
individual
inferiority
to
the
crack
brownsvillers
he
had
won
by
strict
discipline
and
clever
generalship
xxiv
the
victorious
outcome
of
the
run
as
well
as
many
other
victories
and
defeats
had
pretty
well
instilled
it
in
the
lakerim
minds
that
is
an
factor
of
success
but
the
time
came
when
there
was
no
opportunity
to
use
the
easily
forgot
lesson
of
and
it
was
each
man
for
himself
and
all
for
lakerim
and
kingston
when
the
ground
was
soggy
and
mushy
with
the
first
footsteps
of
spring
and
it
was
not
yet
possible
to
practise
to
any
extent
out
of
doors
the
kingston
athletic
association
received
from
the
athletic
association
of
the
troy
latin
school
a
letter
that
was
a
curious
combination
of
hospitality
and
challenge
the
latin
school
in
other
words
opened
its
heart
and
its
gymnasium
and
warmly
invited
the
kingston
athletes
to
come
over
and
be
eaten
up
in
a
grand
indoor
carnival
troy
was
not
so
far
away
that
only
a
small
delegation
could
go
almost
every
one
from
kingston
particularly
those
athletically
inclined
took
the
train
to
troy
most
surprising
of
all
it
was
to
see
the
diminutive
and
bespectacled
history
proudly
joining
the
ranks
of
the
strong
ones
he
was
going
to
troy
to
display
his
microscopical
muscles
in
that
most
wearing
and
violent
of
all
exercises
chess
the
interscholastic
league
which
encouraged
the
practice
of
all
imaginable
digressions
from
had
arranged
for
a
series
of
chess
games
between
teams
selected
from
the
different
academies
the
winners
of
these
preliminary
heats
if
one
can
use
so
calm
a
word
for
so
exciting
a
game
were
to
meet
at
troy
and
play
for
the
championship
of
the
league
if
i
should
describe
the
excitement
of
that
chess
tournament
i
am
afraid
that
this
book
would
be
put
down
as
entirely
too
lively
for
young
readers
so
i
will
simply
say
once
for
all
that
owing
to
history
ability
to
look
wiser
than
any
one
could
possibly
be
and
to
spend
so
much
time
thinking
of
each
move
that
his
deliberation
affected
his
opponents
nerves
and
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
could
so
thoroughly
map
out
future
moves
on
the
inside
of
his
large
skull
and
that
there
was
something
about
his
general
look
of
being
a
wizard
in
boys
clothes
he
won
the
tournament
almost
more
by
his
looks
than
by
his
skill
as
a
tactician
the
whole
academy
and
especially
the
lakerimmers
overwhelmed
this
second
paul
morphy
with
congratulations
and
felt
proud
of
him
but
when
he
attempted
to
explain
how
he
had
won
his
magnificent
battle
and
started
off
with
such
words
as
these
you
will
observe
that
i
used
the
zukertort
opening
and
when
he
began
to
tell
of
his
moves
from
vx
to
qz
or
some
such
place
even
his
best
friends
took
to
tall
timber
the
kingston
visitors
found
that
the
troy
latin
school
was
in
possession
of
a
finer
and
much
larger
gymnasium
than
their
own
but
much
as
they
envied
their
luckier
neighbors
they
determined
that
they
would
prove
that
fine
feathers
do
not
make
fine
birds
nor
a
fine
gymnasium
fine
athletes
a
large
crowd
had
gathered
and
was
put
in
a
good
humor
with
a
beautiful
exhibition
of
by
the
troy
men
on
the
triple
and
horizontal
bars
and
the
double
trapeze
the
trojans
also
gave
a
kaleidoscopic
exhibition
of
tumbling
and
none
of
which
sports
had
been
practised
much
by
the
kingstonians
after
this
the
regular
athletic
contests
of
the
evening
began
in
almost
every
event
at
least
one
of
the
lakerim
men
represented
kingston
some
of
the
dozen
made
a
poor
showing
but
the
majority
owing
to
their
long
devotion
to
the
theory
and
the
practice
of
athletics
stood
out
strongly
and
were
recognized
by
the
strange
audience
in
their
lakerim
sweaters
as
distinguished
heroes
of
the
occasion
the
first
event
was
a
contest
in
in
which
no
lakerim
men
were
entered
kingston
suffered
a
defeat
ill
begun
is
half
done
up
sighed
jumbo
but
in
the
next
event
the
old
reliable
tug
was
entered
among
others
and
in
the
he
ran
up
the
cord
like
a
monkey
on
a
stick
and
touched
the
tambourine
that
hung
feet
in
the
air
before
any
of
his
rivals
reached
their
goal
and
in
better
form
than
any
of
them
the
third
event
was
the
standing
high
jump
and
and
the
other
kingstonians
were
badly
outclassed
here
their
efforts
to
clear
the
bar
compared
with
that
of
the
trojans
as
the
soaring
of
an
elephant
compares
with
the
flight
of
a
butterfly
punk
was
the
only
lakerimmer
on
the
team
that
attempted
to
win
glory
on
the
but
he
and
his
brother
kingstonians
suffered
a
like
humiliation
with
the
standing
the
clerk
of
the
course
and
the
referees
were
now
seen
to
be
running
hither
and
yon
in
great
excitement
a
long
delay
and
much
putting
of
heads
together
ensued
to
the
great
mystification
of
the
audience
at
length
just
as
a
number
of
small
boys
in
the
gallery
had
begun
to
stamp
their
feet
in
military
time
and
whistle
their
indignation
the
official
announcer
officially
announced
that
there
had
been
a
slight
hitch
in
the
proceedings
i
have
to
explain
he
yelled
in
his
gentlest
manner
that
two
of
the
boxers
have
failed
to
turn
up
both
have
excellent
excuses
and
doctors
certificates
to
account
for
their
absence
but
we
have
unfortunately
to
confess
that
the
kingston
and
the
troy
are
incapacitated
for
the
present
the
from
kingston
however
is
a
good
enough
sport
to
express
a
willingness
to
box
for
points
with
the
from
troy
while
this
match
will
look
a
little
unusual
owing
to
the
difference
in
size
of
the
two
opponents
it
will
be
scientific
enough
we
have
no
doubt
to
make
it
interesting
as
well
as
picturesque
as
usual
the
audience
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
applauded
very
cordially
and
now
the
from
troy
one
jaynes
appeared
upon
the
scene
with
his
second
there
was
no
space
but
only
an
imaginary
ring
which
was
as
usual
a
square
of
about
feet
each
way
jaynes
was
just
barely
qualified
as
a
being
only
a
trifle
over
one
hundred
and
pounds
but
he
overshadowed
little
bobbles
as
the
giants
overshadowed
jack
the
bobbles
while
he
was
diminutive
compared
with
jaynes
was
yet
rather
tall
and
wiry
for
his
light
weight
and
had
an
unusually
long
reach
for
one
of
his
size
he
regretted
now
the
great
pains
he
had
taken
to
train
down
to
weight
for
when
he
had
stepped
on
the
scales
in
the
gymnasium
the
day
before
he
had
started
for
troy
he
found
that
he
was
three
pounds
over
the
necessary
hundred
and
fifteen
so
he
had
put
on
three
sweaters
two
pairs
of
trousers
and
his
football
knickers
and
run
around
the
track
for
fully
four
miles
until
he
was
in
doubt
as
to
whether
he
was
a
liquid
or
a
solid
body
then
he
had
fallen
into
a
hot
bath
and
jumped
from
that
into
a
cold
shower
and
had
then
been
rubbed
down
by
some
of
his
faithful
lakerim
friends
with
a
pail
of
to
harden
his
muscles
at
troy
too
he
had
continued
these
tactics
and
found
to
his
delight
when
he
weighed
in
that
he
just
tipped
the
scales
at
one
hundred
and
fifteen
and
now
he
was
matched
to
fight
with
a
and
every
pound
he
had
sweat
off
would
have
been
an
advantage
to
him
yet
at
any
rate
it
was
not
a
fight
to
a
finish
but
only
for
points
and
he
counted
upon
his
agility
to
save
him
from
the
rushes
and
the
major
tactics
of
the
larger
man
in
order
to
make
the
scoring
of
points
more
vivid
and
visible
to
the
audience
it
was
decided
after
some
hesitation
that
the
gloves
should
be
coated
with
bobbles
realized
that
his
salvation
lay
in
quick
attack
and
the
seizure
of
every
possible
opportunity
as
well
as
in
his
ability
to
escape
the
onslaughts
of
the
he
did
not
purpose
turning
it
into
a
but
he
felt
that
he
was
justified
in
making
as
much
use
of
the
art
of
evasion
as
possible
he
began
the
series
by
what
was
almost
sharp
practice
but
was
justified
by
the
rules
the
referee
sang
out
gentlemen
shake
hands
then
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
quickly
clasped
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
time
cried
the
referee
illustration
the
boxing
match
immediately
on
the
before
jaynes
had
got
his
hands
into
position
bobbles
had
landed
on
him
with
a
fine
left
upper
cut
that
put
a
black
mark
on
jaynes
jaw
jaynes
looked
surprised
and
the
audience
laughed
bobbles
also
laughed
for
he
knew
he
would
have
few
chances
to
place
black
spots
on
the
upper
works
of
the
tall
jaynes
and
that
he
must
make
his
scores
mainly
upon
the
zone
just
above
jaynes
belt
jaynes
was
as
much
angered
as
surprised
at
receiving
the
first
blow
and
sailed
in
with
a
vengeance
to
pepper
bobbles
but
he
began
to
think
that
he
was
boxing
with
a
grasshopper
before
long
for
wherever
he
struck
there
bobbles
was
not
in
fact
most
of
his
blows
were
not
only
dodged
by
bobbles
with
the
smallest
necessary
effort
but
were
effectively
countered
bobbles
proved
himself
an
adept
at
that
best
of
boxing
tactics
the
ability
to
dodge
he
rarely
moved
more
than
would
take
him
sufficiently
out
of
harm
way
a
little
bending
of
the
head
from
one
side
to
the
other
a
quick
or
an
adroit
duck
saved
him
from
being
the
of
most
of
jaynes
attacks
there
were
to
be
three
rounds
of
three
minutes
each
with
one
intermission
between
rounds
the
first
round
was
over
before
either
of
the
men
was
much
more
than
well
warmed
up
to
the
work
and
before
either
had
scored
any
impressive
amount
of
points
jaynes
however
realized
that
bobbles
had
landed
oftener
than
he
and
that
the
sympathy
of
the
audience
was
with
the
little
fellow
when
time
was
called
for
the
next
round
therefore
he
decided
to
rush
things
and
he
charged
on
bobbles
with
such
fury
that
and
were
of
little
avail
and
there
was
nothing
for
bobbles
to
do
but
go
into
the
and
try
to
give
as
much
as
he
received
before
they
knew
just
how
they
were
clinched
and
the
referee
was
cutting
them
apart
like
a
and
now
the
big
man
realized
that
on
the
swift
interchange
of
blows
bobbles
was
quicker
than
he
and
that
he
must
keep
him
at
a
little
distance
relying
then
on
his
greater
reach
he
went
at
bobbles
in
a
most
exasperating
manner
holding
one
long
arm
out
straight
and
fanning
bobbles
with
the
other
bobbles
ran
into
the
outstretched
fist
with
great
enthusiasm
at
first
but
after
a
moment
daze
he
dodged
round
and
under
that
arm
and
devoted
himself
to
playing
a
tattoo
on
jaynes
solar
plexus
since
his
glove
left
a
black
mark
wherever
it
struck
it
was
tattooing
in
two
senses
both
men
welcomed
the
gong
that
announced
a
chance
to
breathe
the
grateful
rubbing
down
fanning
and
sponging
of
the
seconds
between
the
rounds
restored
both
men
somewhat
to
their
enthusiasm
though
the
furious
rate
at
which
they
had
taken
the
two
previous
rounds
left
them
bodily
weak
jaynes
second
told
him
during
the
pause
that
bobbles
had
decidedly
the
best
of
it
thus
far
on
form
and
jaynes
temper
was
aroused
bobbles
having
been
told
by
his
second
that
he
had
the
better
of
it
had
grown
a
trifle
rash
and
impudent
and
dared
to
take
the
aggressive
he
went
straight
into
jaynes
zone
of
fire
and
managed
to
plant
several
good
hooks
and
upper
cuts
while
bobbles
was
playing
in
the
upper
regions
for
jaynes
jaynes
made
a
reach
for
bobbles
body
several
times
but
bobbles
was
not
there
when
jaynes
made
a
careless
lead
bobbles
countered
and
dodged
with
remarkable
skill
all
these
things
while
they
increased
bobbles
score
and
standing
with
the
judges
increased
jaynes
temper
and
finally
he
gave
a
vicious
right
swing
which
bobbles
avoided
unintentionally
by
slipping
and
falling
so
he
found
himself
on
the
floor
with
jaynes
standing
over
him
in
expectant
anticipation
of
landing
him
another
ebonizing
blow
he
heard
also
the
referee
beginning
to
count
slowly
the
seconds
his
first
impulse
was
to
rise
to
his
feet
and
assail
jaynes
with
all
his
might
then
he
realized
that
he
had
nine
seconds
for
refreshment
and
there
he
waited
on
one
hand
and
one
knee
while
the
seconds
were
slowly
intoned
until
the
referee
sang
out
nine
then
he
made
a
sidelong
scramble
to
his
feet
and
succeeded
in
dodging
the
blow
with
which
jaynes
welcomed
him
back
jaynes
charged
now
after
bobbles
like
a
spanish
bull
but
the
wiry
lakerimmer
dodged
him
and
smote
back
at
him
while
he
dodged
while
jaynes
losing
his
head
completely
wasted
his
strength
in
futile
rushes
and
wild
blows
that
bruised
nothing
except
the
atmosphere
before
the
end
of
the
round
both
men
were
decidedly
tired
because
the
pace
had
been
very
rapid
the
blows
they
dealt
at
each
other
were
now
hardly
more
than
velvety
shoves
and
the
air
seemed
to
be
the
chief
obstacle
in
their
way
when
by
some
chance
they
clinched
they
leaned
lovingly
upon
each
other
till
the
referee
had
to
pry
them
apart
there
was
a
little
revival
of
interest
just
before
the
gong
sounded
to
end
the
third
and
last
round
for
bobbles
having
regained
some
of
his
wind
began
to
pommel
jaynes
with
surprising
rapidity
and
accuracy
the
end
of
the
bout
found
them
in
a
each
striking
blindly
the
judges
now
met
to
discuss
the
verdict
they
were
to
render
and
there
being
some
dispute
as
to
the
number
of
blows
landed
by
each
the
two
men
were
brought
forward
for
inspection
bobbles
face
and
neck
were
as
black
as
a
piccaninny
but
there
were
few
dark
spots
upon
his
chest
jaynes
however
was
like
a
leopard
for
the
blacking
on
bobbles
gloves
had
mottled
him
all
up
and
down
and
around
as
jumbo
remarked
to
bobbles
certainly
had
designs
on
that
big
fellow
the
judges
had
been
agreed
that
on
the
points
of
defense
guarding
ducking
getting
away
and
bobbles
considering
his
size
was
plainly
the
more
brainy
and
speedy
of
the
two
they
were
also
inclined
to
grant
him
the
greater
number
of
points
on
his
form
in
general
and
especially
on
account
of
the
disparity
in
size
and
reach
and
when
they
counted
the
on
each
they
found
that
here
also
bobbles
had
made
the
highest
score
and
they
did
not
hesitate
to
award
him
the
prize
the
next
event
was
the
high
kick
which
was
won
by
a
kingston
who
was
a
rank
outsider
from
the
dozen
quiz
managed
to
be
third
and
add
one
point
to
the
academy
score
then
came
an
exhibition
of
swinging
jumbo
had
formerly
been
the
great
swinger
of
the
dozen
but
he
had
recently
gone
in
so
enthusiastically
for
wrestling
that
he
had
given
up
his
other
interest
sleepy
had
taken
up
this
discarded
amusement
with
as
much
enthusiasm
as
was
possible
to
him
there
was
something
about
it
that
appealed
to
sleepy
it
was
different
from
and
dumb
bell
exercising
in
that
when
you
once
got
the
clubs
started
they
seemed
to
do
all
the
work
themselves
but
sleepy
was
too
lazy
to
learn
many
of
the
new
wrinkles
and
the
troy
set
him
some
tasks
that
he
could
not
repeat
in
form
too
he
was
not
their
equal
and
this
event
went
to
the
kingston
opponents
a
novelty
was
introduced
here
in
place
of
the
usual
exhibition
from
the
horizontal
bar
a
light
gate
was
hung
and
the
various
contestants
gave
exhibitions
of
vaulting
the
gate
prevented
the
use
of
the
kippie
swing
there
was
no
method
of
twisting
and
writhing
up
to
the
bar
it
had
to
be
clean
vaulting
and
kingston
gradually
raised
the
mark
till
the
troy
men
could
not
go
over
it
at
its
last
notch
only
one
man
made
it
and
that
was
a
kingston
athlete
but
unfortunately
not
a
lakerimmer
as
punk
remained
behind
with
the
others
and
divided
second
place
with
a
rival
a
sack
race
was
introduced
to
furnish
a
little
diversion
for
the
audience
which
in
view
of
the
length
of
the
program
was
beginning
to
believe
that
after
all
it
is
possible
to
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
the
kingstonians
had
put
their
hope
in
this
event
upon
the
twins
none
but
the
dozen
could
tell
them
apart
but
the
kingstonians
felt
confident
that
one
of
the
brotherhood
would
win
out
and
so
it
looked
to
the
audience
when
the
long
row
of
men
were
tied
up
like
dummies
in
sacks
that
reached
to
their
necks
for
after
the
first
muddle
at
the
start
two
small
figures
went
bouncing
along
in
the
lead
like
bags
with
red
stoppers
in
them
the
kingstonians
not
knowing
which
of
the
twins
was
in
the
lead
if
indeed
either
of
them
actually
led
yelled
violently
the
twins
the
twins
it
was
reddy
that
had
got
the
first
start
and
cleared
the
multitude
but
heady
by
a
careful
system
of
jumping
was
soon
alongside
his
brother
he
made
a
effort
to
cut
reddy
off
with
the
result
that
they
wabbled
together
and
fell
in
a
heap
they
did
not
mind
the
fact
that
two
or
three
other
were
falling
all
over
them
nor
did
they
care
what
became
of
the
race
the
desire
of
each
was
to
tear
off
that
sack
and
get
at
the
wretched
brother
that
had
caused
the
fall
not
being
able
to
work
their
hands
loose
they
rolled
toward
each
other
and
began
violently
to
bunt
heads
finding
that
this
banner
of
battle
hurt
the
giver
of
the
blow
as
much
as
it
did
the
receiver
of
it
they
rolled
apart
again
and
began
to
kick
at
each
other
in
a
most
ludicrous
and
undignified
manner
the
lakerimmers
were
finally
compelled
to
rush
in
on
the
track
and
separate
the
loving
brothers
strange
to
say
the
twins
got
no
consolation
for
the
loss
of
the
race
from
the
fact
that
the
audience
had
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
its
face
illustration
tied
up
like
dummies
in
sacks
when
the
running
high
jump
went
to
troy
on
account
of
the
inability
of
to
reach
even
his
own
record
the
kingstonians
began
to
feel
anxious
of
results
troy
had
won
six
events
and
they
had
won
only
four
the
points
too
had
fallen
in
such
a
way
that
there
was
a
bad
discrepancy
appeared
upon
the
horizon
as
a
temporary
rescuer
and
while
he
could
not
put
the
bag
of
shot
so
far
as
he
had
in
better
days
sent
the
solid
shot
still
he
threw
it
farther
than
any
of
the
trojans
could
and
brought
the
kingston
score
up
to
within
one
of
the
events
gone
to
troy
pretty
added
one
more
by
a
display
of
grace
and
skill
in
the
with
foils
that
surprised
even
his
best
friends
from
lakerim
and
won
the
unanimous
vote
of
the
three
judges
themselves
skilful
fencers
a
wet
blanket
was
thrown
on
the
encouragement
of
the
kingstonians
by
their
inferiority
at
was
many
pounds
from
the
power
of
a
certain
powerful
trojan
who
was
a
smaller
man
with
bigger
muscles
then
all
the
members
of
the
dozen
had
a
special
parlay
with
jumbo
imploring
him
to
save
the
day
and
the
honor
of
both
kingston
and
lakerim
by
winning
the
xxv
when
jumbo
glanced
across
the
floor
and
saw
the
man
that
was
to
be
his
opponent
striding
toward
the
mat
in
the
center
of
the
floor
he
wished
that
some
one
else
had
been
placed
as
the
keystone
in
the
kingston
arch
of
success
for
jumbo
knew
well
the
man
record
as
a
wrestler
but
jumbo
himself
while
small
was
well
put
together
and
though
built
as
he
said
close
to
the
ground
he
was
built
for
business
since
he
had
gone
in
for
wrestling
he
had
made
it
the
specialty
of
all
his
athletic
exercises
he
had
practised
everything
that
had
any
bearing
on
the
strengthening
of
particular
muscles
or
general
agility
he
had
practised
back
and
front
flips
he
had
worked
with
his
neck
at
the
machine
he
would
walk
on
his
hands
to
strengthen
his
throat
and
his
collars
had
grown
in
a
few
weeks
from
thirteen
and
a
half
to
fifteen
and
he
could
no
longer
wear
his
old
shirts
without
splitting
them
he
made
the
mats
in
the
kingston
gymnasium
almost
his
home
his
special
studies
were
bridging
and
spinning
he
spent
hours
on
his
back
rising
to
his
two
feet
and
his
head
and
then
rolling
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
and
spinning
to
his
front
when
he
had
his
abilities
fairly
well
started
he
compelled
his
heavy
chum
to
act
as
a
living
and
rolled
around
upon
the
top
of
his
head
and
bridged
with
laying
all
his
weight
across
his
chest
when
he
went
to
bed
he
bridged
there
until
the
best
of
wrestlers
sleep
had
downed
him
when
he
woke
in
the
morning
he
fell
out
of
bed
to
the
floor
turning
his
head
under
him
and
rolling
so
as
not
to
break
his
neck
or
any
bones
and
bridging
rigidly
upon
his
head
and
bare
feet
jumbo
knew
that
whatever
might
be
the
ability
of
his
rival
the
trojan
ware
at
least
he
jumbo
could
have
his
conscience
easy
with
the
thought
that
he
had
made
the
most
profitable
use
of
the
short
time
he
had
spent
on
wrestling
and
that
he
would
put
up
as
good
a
fight
as
was
in
him
more
than
that
no
athlete
can
do
jumbo
and
ware
met
upon
the
mattress
with
their
heads
looking
like
bulldogs
jowls
and
they
shook
hands
if
one
can
imagine
bulldogs
shaking
hands
jumbo
had
two
cardinal
principles
but
he
could
put
neither
of
them
into
practice
in
the
first
maneuvers
the
first
was
always
to
try
to
get
out
of
one
difficulty
by
dumping
the
opponent
into
another
the
second
was
always
to
try
for
leverages
ware
being
the
larger
of
the
two
jumbo
was
content
to
play
a
waiting
game
and
find
out
something
of
the
methods
of
his
burly
opponent
he
dodged
here
and
there
avoiding
the
reaching
of
ware
by
quick
wriggles
or
by
slapping
his
hands
away
as
they
thrust
suddenly
ware
made
a
quick
rush
and
breaking
through
jumbo
interference
seized
him
around
the
body
to
bend
him
backward
but
while
the
man
was
straining
his
hardest
jumbo
brought
his
hands
around
and
placed
them
together
in
front
of
the
pit
of
his
stomach
so
that
the
harder
ware
squeezed
the
harder
he
pressed
jumbo
fists
into
his
abdomen
ware
looked
foolish
at
being
foiled
so
neatly
and
broke
away
only
to
come
at
jumbo
again
and
clasp
him
so
close
that
there
was
no
room
for
his
fists
to
press
against
ware
diaphragm
but
now
jumbo
suddenly
clasped
his
left
arm
back
of
ware
neck
and
with
his
right
hand
bent
the
man
forehead
back
until
he
was
glad
enough
to
let
go
and
spring
away
ware
continued
to
run
around
jumbo
as
a
dog
runs
around
a
treed
cat
but
jumbo
always
evaded
his
quick
rushes
till
ware
after
many
false
moves
finally
made
a
sudden
and
unforeseen
dash
seized
right
hand
with
both
of
his
whirled
in
close
and
with
his
back
against
jumbo
chest
carried
the
lakerimmer
right
arm
straight
and
stiff
across
his
shoulder
bearing
down
with
all
his
weight
on
this
lever
and
at
the
same
time
dropping
to
his
knees
he
shot
jumbo
over
his
shoulders
heels
over
head
that
flying
mere
was
certainly
a
bird
said
bobbles
ware
went
down
with
jumbo
to
land
on
his
chest
and
break
any
bridge
the
boy
might
form
and
the
flying
mere
had
been
such
a
surprise
and
the
fall
was
so
far
and
the
floor
so
hard
that
while
jumbo
instinctively
tried
to
bridge
his
effort
collapsed
his
two
shoulders
touched
the
bout
was
over
the
first
fall
had
been
so
quickly
accomplished
and
jumbo
had
offered
so
feeble
a
resistance
that
the
troy
faction
at
once
accepted
the
as
theirs
and
the
kingstonians
gave
up
the
evening
as
hopelessly
lost
jumbo
was
especially
covered
with
chagrin
since
he
had
practised
so
long
and
had
builded
so
many
hopes
on
this
victory
worst
of
all
the
whole
success
of
the
contest
between
the
two
academies
depended
on
his
victory
when
then
after
a
rest
the
referee
called
time
ware
came
stalking
up
jauntily
and
confidently
but
jumbo
instead
of
skulking
was
up
and
at
and
on
him
like
a
wildcat
ware
had
expected
that
the
lakerim
youngster
would
pursue
the
same
elusive
tactics
as
before
and
he
was
all
amaze
while
jumbo
was
seizing
his
left
hand
with
his
own
left
hand
and
darting
round
behind
him
was
bending
ware
arm
backward
and
upward
into
the
hammerlock
the
pain
of
this
twist
sent
ware
body
forward
so
that
jumbo
could
reach
up
under
his
right
armpit
and
placing
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
on
the
back
of
ware
head
make
use
of
that
crowbar
known
as
the
right
this
pressure
was
gradually
forcing
ware
forward
on
the
top
of
his
head
but
he
knew
the
proper
break
for
the
hammerlock
and
simply
threw
himself
face
forward
on
the
mat
as
he
rose
to
his
knees
again
jumbo
pounced
on
him
like
a
hawk
and
while
ware
waited
patiently
the
little
lakerimmer
was
reaching
under
ware
armpit
again
for
another
but
ware
simply
dodged
the
grasping
of
jumbo
right
hand
or
bringing
his
right
arm
vigorously
back
and
down
so
checked
jumbo
arm
that
the
boy
could
not
reach
his
neck
jumbo
now
tried
by
leaning
his
left
forearm
and
all
his
weight
upon
ware
head
to
bring
it
into
reach
but
neck
was
too
strong
and
when
he
stiffened
it
jumbo
could
not
force
it
down
ware
waited
in
amused
patience
to
learn
just
how
much
jumbo
knew
about
wrestling
jumbo
wandered
around
on
his
knees
feinting
for
another
and
making
many
false
plays
to
throw
ware
off
his
guard
suddenly
while
ware
seemed
to
be
all
neck
against
a
jumbo
dropped
to
his
knees
near
ware
right
arm
and
shooting
his
left
arm
under
ware
body
and
his
right
arm
across
beneath
chin
laid
violent
hold
on
the
man
left
arm
near
the
shoulder
with
what
is
known
as
the
hold
jumbo
movement
was
so
quick
and
unexpected
that
ware
could
not
parry
it
by
throwing
his
left
leg
out
and
forward
for
a
brake
he
realized
at
once
that
he
would
have
to
go
and
when
jumbo
gave
a
quick
yank
he
rolled
over
and
bridged
but
jumbo
followed
him
quickly
over
and
clasping
ware
left
arm
between
his
legs
he
forced
the
right
arm
out
straight
also
with
both
his
hands
so
that
ware
could
not
roll
then
he
simply
pressed
with
all
his
force
upon
ware
chest
and
waited
also
weighted
ware
squirmed
and
wriggled
and
grunted
and
writhed
but
there
was
no
escape
for
him
and
while
he
stuck
it
out
manfully
with
jumbo
heavy
upon
him
he
knew
that
he
was
a
goner
and
finally
with
a
sickly
groan
london
bridge
came
down
the
bout
was
jumbo
and
he
retired
to
his
corner
with
a
heart
much
lighter
the
applause
of
the
audience
the
enthusiasm
of
the
kingston
academy
yell
followed
by
the
beloved
club
cry
of
lakerim
rejoiced
him
mightily
he
had
put
down
a
man
far
heavier
than
he
and
he
felt
that
possibly
perchance
maybe
there
was
a
probability
of
a
contingency
in
which
he
might
be
able
to
have
a
chance
of
downing
him
once
more
perhaps
it
was
a
very
cool
and
cautious
young
man
that
came
forward
to
represent
kingston
when
the
referee
exclaimed
shake
hands
for
the
third
and
last
bout
jumbo
as
soon
as
he
had
released
ware
fingers
dropped
to
his
hands
and
knees
on
the
mat
squatting
far
back
on
his
haunches
and
manifested
a
cheerful
willingness
to
go
almost
anywhere
except
on
the
back
of
his
two
shoulders
it
was
ware
turn
to
be
aggressive
now
for
he
had
been
laughed
at
not
a
little
for
being
downed
by
so
small
an
opponent
he
spent
some
time
and
more
strength
in
picking
jumbo
up
bodily
from
the
mat
and
dropping
him
all
over
the
place
jumbo
practice
at
bridging
stood
him
in
excellent
stead
now
and
he
got
out
of
many
a
tight
corner
by
a
quick
firm
bridge
or
a
sudden
spin
ware
time
after
time
forced
one
of
the
boy
shoulders
to
the
mat
and
strove
with
all
his
vim
to
force
the
other
shoulder
down
and
he
generally
succeeded
but
the
first
always
came
up
jumbo
went
willingly
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
but
never
from
one
to
both
he
frequently
showed
a
most
obliging
disposition
and
did
what
ware
wanted
him
to
or
rather
he
did
just
that
and
a
little
more
he
always
went
too
far
and
ware
was
becoming
convinced
that
he
never
could
get
those
two
obstinate
to
the
mat
at
the
same
time
after
much
puttering
he
reached
the
goal
of
his
ambition
and
got
the
deadly
on
jumbo
head
and
forced
it
slowly
and
irresistibly
down
just
as
he
was
congratulating
himself
that
he
had
his
fish
landed
jumbo
suddenly
whirled
his
legs
forward
and
assumed
a
sitting
position
the
whole
problem
was
reversed
ware
rose
wearily
to
his
feet
and
jumbo
returned
to
his
hands
and
knees
once
more
ware
strove
for
the
nelson
he
was
jabbing
jumbo
head
and
trying
to
shove
it
down
within
reach
of
his
right
hand
suddenly
with
a
surprising
abruptness
jumbo
head
was
not
there
he
had
jerked
it
quickly
to
one
side
and
ware
hand
slipped
down
and
almost
touched
the
floor
but
the
watchful
jumbo
had
seized
ware
wrist
with
both
hands
and
returned
to
the
big
fellow
the
compliment
of
the
leverage
and
the
flying
mere
which
had
been
so
fatal
to
himself
in
the
first
bout
ware
fall
was
not
nearly
so
far
as
jumbo
had
been
and
he
managed
to
bridge
and
save
himself
before
jumbo
could
settle
on
his
chest
ware
was
out
of
danger
but
he
went
to
his
hands
and
knees
in
a
defensive
attitude
that
showed
he
was
nearly
worn
out
jumbo
did
not
see
just
what
right
ware
had
to
imitate
his
own
position
and
the
two
of
them
sprawled
like
frogs
eying
each
other
jealously
jumbo
soon
saw
that
he
was
expected
to
take
the
aggressive
or
go
to
sleep
so
with
a
lazy
sigh
he
began
snooping
around
for
those
nuggets
of
wrestling
the
nelsons
after
foiling
many
efforts
the
trojan
noted
all
at
once
that
jumbo
head
was
not
above
shoulders
but
back
of
the
right
armpit
in
a
flash
a
thought
of
pity
went
through
ware
brain
poor
fool
he
almost
groaned
aloud
and
reaching
back
he
gathered
jumbo
head
into
chancery
a
sigh
went
up
from
all
kingston
and
gasped
poor
jumbo
gone
but
just
as
ware
chuckling
with
glee
started
to
roll
jumbo
over
the
boy
swung
at
right
angles
across
ware
back
and
brought
the
arm
helplessly
to
the
hammerlock
this
was
a
new
trick
to
ware
one
he
had
never
heard
of
but
one
that
he
understood
and
respected
immediately
he
yielded
to
it
judiciously
and
managed
to
spin
on
his
head
before
jumbo
could
land
on
his
chest
ware
had
more
respect
now
for
jumbo
and
decided
to
keep
him
on
the
defensive
especially
as
a
bystander
announced
that
the
time
was
almost
up
ware
rushed
the
contest
and
after
many
failures
managed
to
secure
a
perfect
jumbo
position
was
such
that
there
was
no
way
for
him
to
squirm
out
he
resisted
until
it
seemed
that
his
neck
would
break
in
vain
his
head
was
slowly
forced
under
and
now
his
shoulders
began
to
follow
and
he
was
rolling
over
on
his
back
one
shoulder
is
down
the
referee
is
on
all
fours
his
cheek
almost
to
the
ground
he
is
watching
for
the
meeting
of
those
two
shoulders
upon
the
mat
the
kingstonians
have
given
up
and
the
trojans
have
their
cheers
all
ready
and
now
the
despairing
jumbo
feels
that
his
last
minute
has
come
but
just
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
he
sees
that
the
cautious
ware
is
slightly
changing
his
hold
with
a
sudden
a
terrific
effort
he
throws
all
his
soul
into
his
muscles
closes
his
arms
like
a
vise
on
ware
arms
the
nelson
is
broken
or
weakened
into
uselessness
he
draws
his
head
into
his
shoulders
as
a
turtle
head
is
drawn
into
its
shell
whirls
like
lightning
on
the
top
of
his
head
to
his
other
shoulder
and
on
over
carrying
the
horrified
ware
with
him
plouncing
the
trojan
flat
on
his
back
and
plumping
down
on
top
of
him
and
the
excited
referee
went
over
on
his
back
also
and
kicked
his
heels
foolishly
in
the
air
as
he
cried
down
jumbo
had
won
the
match
this
brought
the
score
of
contests
back
to
a
tie
and
the
result
of
these
olympic
games
now
rested
entirely
on
the
victors
of
the
tug
of
war
xxvi
curiously
enough
the
trojans
and
the
kingstonians
had
each
won
a
series
of
firsts
seconds
and
thirds
that
totaled
up
the
same
so
the
tug
of
war
which
had
been
intended
only
for
an
exhibition
became
in
a
sense
the
deciding
event
of
the
whole
contest
the
captain
of
the
kingston
four
was
the
large
who
was
also
the
anchor
of
his
team
he
came
out
upon
the
floor
wearing
around
his
waist
a
belt
that
was
almost
as
graceful
as
a
and
quite
as
heavy
made
as
it
was
of
padded
leather
it
was
suspended
from
his
shoulders
like
a
and
carried
a
deep
groove
around
the
middle
of
it
the
troy
captain
had
a
similar
contrivance
about
him
and
he
looked
somewhat
contemptuously
upon
the
kingstonians
who
had
not
the
beefy
brawny
look
of
his
own
big
four
the
eight
took
their
places
on
the
long
board
each
man
with
his
feet
against
a
cleat
the
rope
was
marked
in
its
exact
center
with
a
white
cord
and
held
there
by
a
lever
which
the
umpire
pressed
down
with
his
foot
the
troy
tuggers
took
a
stout
hold
on
the
rope
and
faced
the
kingstonians
gloweringly
the
kingston
men
however
faced
to
the
rear
and
straddled
the
rope
all
except
who
had
wrapped
it
round
his
belt
and
taken
a
hitch
in
it
for
security
he
faced
the
trojans
and
hoped
that
science
would
defeat
beef
once
more
in
the
history
of
athletics
when
all
were
ready
the
umpire
shouted
go
and
at
the
same
instant
released
the
lever
and
the
cable
the
trojans
threw
all
their
muscle
into
one
terrific
jerk
but
each
of
men
gripping
the
cable
in
front
of
him
at
fell
forward
face
down
by
the
impact
of
their
full
weight
and
by
relying
not
merely
upon
their
arms
but
on
the
whole
pull
of
back
and
legs
the
kingstonians
gave
the
rope
a
yank
that
would
have
annoyed
an
and
certainly
left
the
trojans
no
chance
after
this
first
assault
the
teams
found
themselves
thus
the
kingstonians
were
stretched
prone
upon
the
board
with
their
legs
straight
against
the
cleats
was
braced
against
his
cleat
and
seated
facing
troy
the
rival
team
was
seated
but
with
knees
bent
and
their
captain
glared
amazed
at
who
was
busily
taking
in
over
a
foot
of
captured
cable
the
trojan
captain
winthrop
by
name
gave
a
signal
grunt
to
which
his
men
responded
with
a
fury
regaining
about
two
of
the
lost
inches
this
lifted
slightly
off
the
board
and
in
response
to
three
or
four
bitter
wrenches
from
troy
he
was
forced
to
let
them
have
six
inches
more
cable
lest
they
cut
him
in
two
like
a
cake
of
soap
but
kingston
had
learned
by
painful
experience
the
signals
of
the
troy
captain
and
just
as
the
trojans
were
reaching
confidently
forward
for
a
new
hold
the
alert
murmured
a
quick
hint
and
his
men
gave
a
sudden
hunch
that
took
the
enemy
unawares
and
brought
back
home
three
inches
of
beautiful
rope
the
same
watchfulness
won
another
three
and
there
they
held
the
white
string
a
foot
to
their
side
when
the
time
was
up
and
the
lever
was
clamped
down
after
a
short
rest
the
men
resined
their
hands
anew
and
prepared
for
the
second
pull
the
trojan
captain
had
been
wise
enough
to
see
the
advantage
of
the
kingston
forward
fall
and
he
was
not
too
modest
to
adopt
it
when
the
lever
was
supped
the
second
time
both
teams
fell
face
downward
but
now
troy
greater
bulk
told
to
her
advantage
and
she
carried
the
white
cord
six
inches
to
her
side
the
kingstons
lay
with
their
knees
bent
now
tried
a
preconcerted
trick
signal
with
ominous
tone
he
cried
now
boys
all
together
heave
at
the
word
heave
the
trojans
braced
like
oxen
against
the
expected
jerk
but
none
came
and
they
relaxed
a
little
feeling
that
they
had
been
fooled
but
men
were
slowly
and
silently
counting
five
and
then
with
a
mighty
heave
they
yearned
forward
and
catching
the
winthrop
team
unprepared
got
back
four
inches
they
tried
it
again
and
made
only
about
an
inch
a
third
time
gave
the
signal
and
the
trojans
recognizing
it
waited
a
bit
before
bracing
for
the
shock
but
for
the
third
time
had
arranged
that
the
pull
should
immediately
follow
the
command
again
the
trojans
were
fooled
and
the
white
went
two
inches
into
kingston
territory
the
trojans
now
grew
angry
and
panicky
and
began
to
wrench
and
twist
without
regard
for
one
another
the
result
of
this
was
that
kingston
gradually
gained
three
inches
more
before
winthrop
could
coax
his
men
back
to
reason
and
the
time
was
almost
gone
now
and
he
got
his
men
into
a
series
of
steady
deadly
efforts
that
threatened
to
bring
the
whole
kingston
four
over
with
the
white
cord
but
pleaded
with
his
men
and
they
buried
their
faces
in
the
board
and
worked
like
mad
to
the
spectators
they
seemed
hardly
to
move
but
under
their
skins
their
muscles
were
crowding
and
shoving
like
a
gang
of
slaves
and
fairly
squeezing
streams
of
sweat
out
of
them
as
if
their
gleaming
hides
were
sponges
and
then
after
what
seemed
a
whole
night
of
agony
the
white
cord
budged
no
more
though
the
trojans
pulled
themselves
almost
inside
out
and
suddenly
the
lever
nipped
the
rope
and
the
contest
was
over
the
trojans
were
all
faint
and
the
head
of
winthrop
fell
forward
limply
even
was
so
dizzy
that
he
had
to
be
helped
across
the
floor
by
his
friends
but
they
were
glad
enough
to
pay
him
this
aid
all
kingston
had
learned
to
love
the
sturdy
giant
and
the
lakerimmers
were
prouder
of
him
than
ever
for
it
was
through
him
that
the
fatal
balance
had
been
pulled
down
to
kingston
side
so
that
the
team
could
take
another
victory
home
with
them
to
the
academy
xxvii
as
the
school
year
rolled
on
toward
its
finish
in
june
times
became
busier
and
busier
for
the
students
especially
for
the
lakerimmers
who
felt
a
great
responsibility
upon
their
shoulders
the
responsibility
of
keeping
the
lakerim
athletic
club
pennant
flying
to
the
fore
in
all
the
different
businesses
of
academic
life
in
the
classroom
at
the
prize
speaking
in
the
debating
society
and
most
of
all
in
the
different
athletic
affairs
it
was
no
longer
necessary
as
it
had
been
at
home
in
lakerim
for
the
same
twelve
men
to
play
all
the
games
known
to
humanity
to
make
a
specialty
of
everything
so
to
speak
at
kingston
while
they
were
still
one
body
and
soul
and
kept
up
their
union
with
constant
powwows
in
one
another
rooms
but
most
often
in
tug
they
were
divided
variously
among
the
athletic
teams
where
each
one
felt
that
his
own
honor
was
lakerim
their
motto
was
the
motto
of
the
three
musketeers
all
for
one
and
one
for
all
the
springtime
athletics
found
the
best
of
them
choosing
between
the
boat
crew
and
the
ball
team
it
was
a
hard
choice
for
some
of
them
who
loved
to
be
but
a
choice
was
necessary
the
kingston
academy
possessed
so
many
good
fellows
that
not
all
of
the
dozen
found
a
place
on
the
eight
or
the
nine
still
there
were
enough
of
them
successful
to
keep
lakerim
material
still
strongly
in
evidence
of
the
men
that
tried
for
the
crew
all
were
sifted
out
gradually
except
quiz
and
punk
the
training
was
a
severe
one
under
a
coach
who
had
graduated
some
years
before
from
kingston
and
had
come
back
to
bring
his
beloved
academy
first
across
the
line
as
it
had
gone
the
year
he
had
captained
the
crew
as
the
training
went
on
the
man
who
had
been
elected
captain
of
the
eight
worked
so
faithfully
or
overworked
so
faithfully
that
he
was
trained
up
to
the
finest
point
some
two
or
three
weeks
before
the
great
regatta
of
academies
every
day
after
that
he
lost
in
form
in
spite
of
himself
and
the
coach
had
finally
to
make
him
abdicate
the
throne
and
punk
who
had
worked
in
his
usual
slow
and
conservative
fashion
seemed
the
fittest
man
to
succeed
him
so
punk
became
captain
of
the
crew
and
found
himself
at
the
old
post
of
on
the
day
of
the
great
henley
of
the
interscholastic
league
when
all
the
crews
had
got
away
in
their
best
style
after
two
vexatious
false
starts
punk
slowly
and
without
any
impatience
urged
his
crew
past
all
the
others
till
kingston
led
them
all
from
this
place
he
could
study
his
rivals
well
and
after
some
shifting
of
positions
he
saw
the
troy
latin
school
eight
coming
cleanly
out
of
the
parade
and
making
swiftly
after
him
suddenly
a
great
nervousness
seized
him
because
he
remembered
the
time
the
year
before
when
the
lakerim
crew
rowed
troy
and
when
his
oar
had
broken
just
before
the
finish
so
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
jump
out
into
the
water
and
had
missed
the
joy
of
riding
over
the
line
with
his
winning
lakerimmers
he
wondered
now
if
this
oar
would
also
play
him
false
but
he
had
selected
it
with
experienced
care
and
hard
as
he
strained
it
and
pathetically
as
it
groaned
it
stood
him
in
good
stead
and
carried
him
and
the
seven
who
rowed
with
him
safely
into
the
paradise
of
victory
xxviii
of
the
lakerimmers
who
tried
for
the
baseball
team
four
men
were
elevated
to
the
glory
of
positions
on
the
regular
nine
sleepy
had
somehow
proved
that
was
safer
when
he
was
seeming
to
take
a
nap
there
than
it
was
under
the
guard
of
any
of
the
more
restless
players
tug
was
a
second
baseman
whose
cool
head
made
him
a
good
man
at
that
pivot
of
the
field
he
was
an
able
assistant
to
the
a
ready
to
the
and
a
perfect
spider
for
taking
into
his
web
all
the
wild
throws
that
came
slashing
from
the
home
plate
to
cut
off
those
who
dared
to
try
to
steal
his
base
was
the
nearest
of
all
the
kingstonians
to
resembling
a
so
he
had
no
real
competitors
for
first
base
he
declined
to
play
however
unless
jumbo
were
given
the
position
of
and
jumbo
soon
proved
that
he
had
some
other
rights
to
the
position
besides
a
powerful
pull
reddy
and
heady
had
worked
like
beavers
to
be
accepted
as
the
battery
but
the
pitcher
and
catcher
of
the
year
before
were
so
satisfactory
that
the
twins
could
get
no
nearer
to
their
ambitions
than
the
and
there
it
seemed
they
were
pretty
sure
to
remain
upon
the
shelf
in
spite
of
all
the
practice
they
had
kept
up
even
through
the
winter
the
kingston
had
found
its
only
rival
to
the
championship
of
the
interscholastic
league
in
the
nine
from
the
charleston
preparatory
school
the
kingstonians
all
plucked
up
hope
however
when
they
found
themselves
at
the
end
of
the
season
one
game
ahead
of
charleston
or
at
least
they
called
it
one
game
ahead
for
charleston
had
played
off
its
schedule
and
kingston
had
only
one
more
nine
to
defeat
and
that
was
the
brownsville
school
for
boys
the
poorest
team
in
the
whole
league
a
pack
of
with
butter
on
their
fingers
and
holes
in
their
bats
so
kingston
counted
the
pennant
as
good
as
won
down
the
team
went
to
brownsville
then
just
to
see
how
big
a
score
they
could
roll
up
back
they
came
from
brownsville
so
dazed
they
almost
rode
past
the
kingston
station
for
when
they
had
reached
the
ballground
one
of
those
curious
moods
that
attacks
a
team
as
it
attacks
a
single
person
seized
them
and
took
away
the
whole
knack
that
had
won
them
so
many
games
the
brownsvillers
on
the
other
hand
seemed
to
have
been
inspired
by
something
in
the
air
they
simply
could
not
muff
the
ball
or
strike
out
they
found
and
pounded
the
curves
of
the
kingston
pitcher
so
badly
that
the
substitute
battery
would
have
been
put
in
had
they
not
been
left
behind
because
it
was
not
thought
worth
while
to
pay
their
fare
down
to
brownsville
the
upshot
of
the
horrible
afternoon
was
that
brownsville
sent
kingston
home
with
its
feelings
bruised
black
and
blue
and
its
record
done
up
in
cotton
it
was
a
good
thing
that
kingston
had
prepared
no
bonfire
for
the
victory
they
had
thought
would
be
so
easy
because
if
the
defeated
nine
had
been
met
with
such
a
mockery
they
would
surely
have
perished
of
mortification
the
loss
of
this
game
think
of
it
the
score
was
to
tied
the
kingstonians
with
the
charlestonians
and
another
game
was
necessary
to
decide
the
contest
for
the
pennant
that
game
was
immediately
arranged
for
commencement
week
on
the
kingston
grounds
and
now
the
twins
who
had
resigned
themselves
to
having
never
a
chance
on
the
nine
found
themselves
suddenly
called
upon
to
pitch
and
catch
in
game
of
the
year
for
the
drubbing
the
regular
pitcher
had
received
had
destroyed
the
confidence
of
the
team
in
his
ability
to
pitch
a
second
time
successfully
against
the
charlestonians
to
make
matters
worse
the
game
was
to
come
almost
in
the
very
midst
of
the
final
examinations
of
the
year
and
the
twins
became
so
mixed
up
in
their
efforts
to
cram
into
their
heads
all
the
knowledge
in
the
world
and
to
pull
out
of
their
fingers
all
of
the
curves
known
to
science
that
one
day
reddy
said
to
heady
i
half
believe
that
when
i
get
up
for
oral
examination
i
be
so
rattled
that
instead
of
answering
the
question
i
try
to
throw
the
on
an
upshoot
at
the
professor
head
and
heady
answered
even
more
glumly
i
would
mind
that
so
much
what
i
afraid
of
is
that
when
you
really
need
to
use
that
you
throw
only
a
few
dates
at
the
batter
i
will
signal
for
an
and
you
stand
in
the
box
and
tie
yourself
in
a
and
throw
at
me
something
about
columbus
discovering
america
in
or
you
reel
off
some
problem
about
plastering
the
inside
of
a
room
leaving
room
for
four
doors
and
six
windows
when
the
day
of
the
game
arrived
however
reddy
and
heady
took
their
positions
with
the
proud
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
they
had
passed
all
their
examinations
now
they
wondered
what
percentage
they
would
make
in
their
baseball
examination
sleepy
however
went
out
to
not
knowing
where
he
stood
he
knew
so
little
about
his
books
indeed
that
even
after
the
examination
was
over
he
could
tell
none
of
the
fellows
what
answers
he
had
made
to
what
questions
and
so
they
could
not
tell
him
whether
or
no
he
had
failed
ignominiously
or
passed
accidentally
this
worry
however
sat
very
lightly
on
sleepy
nerves
the
largest
crowd
of
the
year
was
gathered
to
witness
the
greatest
game
of
the
year
and
charleston
and
kingston
were
tuned
up
to
the
highest
pitch
they
could
reach
without
breaking
the
day
was
perfect
and
in
the
preliminary
practice
the
kingstonians
showed
that
they
were
determined
to
wipe
out
the
disgrace
of
the
brownsville
game
or
at
least
to
cover
it
up
with
the
scalps
of
the
charlestonians
at
length
the
charlestonians
were
called
in
by
their
captain
for
they
were
first
at
bat
the
kingstonians
dispread
themselves
over
the
field
in
their
various
positions
the
umpire
tossed
to
the
nervous
reddy
what
seemed
to
be
a
snowball
whose
whiteness
he
immediately
covered
with
dust
from
the
box
the
charlestonian
batter
came
to
the
plate
and
tapped
it
smartly
three
or
four
times
the
umpire
sang
out
reddy
cast
a
nervous
look
around
the
field
then
went
into
a
spasm
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
skin
the
cat
on
an
invisible
out
of
the
he
suddenly
straightened
himself
the
first
baseman
saw
a
dusty
white
shoot
past
him
and
heard
the
umpire
dulcet
voice
growl
strike
which
pleased
the
kingston
audience
so
mightily
that
they
broke
forth
into
cheers
and
applause
that
upset
reddy
so
completely
that
the
next
ball
slipped
from
his
hand
and
came
toward
the
first
baseman
so
gently
that
he
could
hardly
have
missed
it
had
he
tried
the
kingstonian
cheer
disappeared
in
a
groan
as
everybody
heard
that
unmistakable
whack
that
resounds
whenever
the
bat
and
the
ball
meet
face
to
face
but
the
very
sureness
of
the
hit
was
its
ruination
for
it
went
soaring
like
a
straight
home
to
the
hands
of
sleepy
who
without
moving
from
his
place
reached
up
and
took
it
in
the
kingston
groan
was
now
changed
back
again
to
a
cheer
and
the
first
batter
of
the
first
half
of
the
first
inning
had
scored
the
first
out
the
charleston
third
baseman
now
came
to
the
bat
three
times
in
succession
reddy
failed
to
get
the
ball
over
the
plate
and
the
man
evidently
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
to
get
his
base
on
balls
for
at
the
fourth
pitch
he
dropped
his
bat
and
started
for
first
base
only
to
be
called
back
by
the
umpire
voice
declaring
a
strike
to
his
immense
disgust
two
other
strikes
followed
it
and
he
went
to
the
bench
instead
of
to
the
base
the
third
charlestonian
caught
the
first
ball
pitched
by
reddy
and
sent
it
bounding
toward
jumbo
who
ripped
it
off
the
ground
and
had
it
in
the
hands
of
his
chum
before
the
charlestonian
was
to
first
base
this
retired
the
side
and
the
kingstonians
came
in
to
bat
amid
a
pleasant
april
shower
of
applause
was
the
first
kingston
man
to
take
a
club
to
the
charlestonians
he
waved
his
bat
violently
up
and
down
and
stared
fiercely
at
the
charleston
pitcher
his
ferocity
disappeared
however
when
he
saw
the
ball
coming
at
a
frightful
speed
straight
at
him
and
threatening
to
take
a
large
scoop
out
of
his
stomach
he
stretched
up
and
back
and
away
from
it
with
a
ridiculous
wiggle
that
was
the
more
ridiculous
when
he
saw
the
ball
curve
harmlessly
over
the
plate
and
heard
the
umpire
cry
strike
one
he
upbraided
himself
for
his
fear
and
when
the
next
ball
was
pitched
though
he
felt
sure
that
it
was
going
to
strike
him
on
the
shoulder
he
did
not
budge
but
here
he
made
mistake
number
two
for
the
ball
did
not
curve
as
the
pitcher
had
intended
but
gave
the
batter
a
sharp
nip
just
where
it
said
it
would
the
only
apology
the
pitcher
made
was
the
rueful
look
with
which
he
watched
going
down
to
first
base
the
kingston
was
the
next
at
the
bat
and
he
sent
a
little
roman
candle
of
a
fly
that
fell
cozily
into
the
third
hands
jumbo
now
came
to
the
plate
and
swinged
at
the
ball
so
violently
that
one
might
have
thought
he
was
trying
to
lift
bodily
from
first
base
to
second
but
he
managed
only
to
send
a
slow
coach
of
a
liner
that
raced
him
to
first
base
and
beat
him
there
however
had
managed
to
make
second
before
the
charleston
first
baseman
could
throw
him
out
and
there
he
pined
away
for
the
kingston
third
baseman
struck
out
possibly
in
compliment
to
the
charleston
third
baseman
who
had
done
the
same
thing
this
complimentary
spirit
seemed
to
fill
the
also
for
he
sent
down
to
his
rival
jumbo
a
considerately
easy
little
fly
which
stuck
to
jumbo
palms
as
firmly
as
if
there
had
been
on
them
the
charleston
catcher
now
found
reddy
for
a
clean
between
left
and
center
field
he
tried
to
stretch
it
into
a
hit
and
the
kingston
center
fielded
the
ball
in
so
slowly
that
he
succeeded
in
his
grasping
attempt
the
charlestonian
second
baseman
made
a
sacrifice
hit
that
advanced
the
catcher
to
third
and
now
the
pitcher
came
to
the
bat
eager
to
bring
home
the
wretch
at
whom
he
had
hurled
his
swiftest
curves
his
anxiety
led
him
into
making
two
foolish
jabs
at
curves
that
were
out
of
his
reach
and
finally
he
caught
one
just
on
the
tip
of
his
bat
and
it
went
neatly
into
tug
hand
leaving
the
catcher
to
perish
on
third
base
sleepy
now
came
to
the
bat
for
kingston
and
without
making
any
undue
exertion
deftly
placed
a
fly
between
the
and
the
and
reached
first
base
on
a
canter
he
made
no
rash
attempts
to
steal
second
but
waited
to
be
assisted
there
the
kingston
however
struck
out
and
made
way
for
reddy
reddy
though
a
pitcher
was
like
most
pitchers
unable
to
solve
the
mystery
of
a
rival
curves
for
more
than
a
little
grounder
that
lost
him
first
base
and
forced
sleepy
to
a
most
uncomfortable
exertion
to
keep
from
being
headed
off
at
second
tug
now
came
to
the
bat
but
unfortunately
while
the
hit
he
knocked
was
a
sturdy
one
it
went
toward
third
base
and
sleepy
did
not
dare
venture
off
second
though
he
made
a
feint
at
third
which
engaged
the
baseman
attention
until
tug
reached
first
heady
now
came
to
the
bat
and
some
of
the
charlestonians
insisted
that
he
had
batted
before
but
they
were
soon
convinced
of
their
error
when
the
twins
were
placed
side
by
side
heady
puzzled
them
even
more
however
by
scratching
off
just
such
another
measly
bunt
as
his
brother
had
failed
with
and
when
he
was
put
out
at
first
sleepy
and
tug
realized
that
their
running
had
been
in
vain
sleepy
thought
of
the
terrific
inconvenience
the
struggle
for
the
three
bases
had
caused
him
and
was
almost
sorry
that
he
had
not
struck
out
in
the
first
place
the
charleston
opened
the
third
inning
with
a
graceful
fly
just
this
side
the
reach
in
that
field
where
seem
to
grow
most
plentifully
the
kingston
was
presented
with
a
base
on
balls
which
forced
the
to
second
base
now
reddy
recovered
sufficiently
to
strike
out
the
next
charleston
batter
though
the
one
after
him
sent
into
right
field
a
long
low
fly
which
the
kingston
caught
on
the
first
bound
and
hurled
furiously
to
third
base
to
head
off
the
charleston
runner
the
throw
was
wild
and
a
sickening
sensation
went
through
the
hearts
of
all
as
they
saw
it
hurtle
past
the
third
baseman
the
charleston
runner
rejoiced
and
giving
the
bag
a
mere
touch
with
his
foot
started
gaily
for
home
a
warning
cry
from
his
coach
however
checked
him
in
full
speed
and
he
whirled
about
to
see
that
sleepy
foreseeing
the
throw
from
as
soon
as
the
ball
left
the
bat
had
sauntered
over
behind
the
third
baseman
had
stopped
the
wild
throw
and
now
stood
waiting
for
the
to
declare
his
intention
before
he
threw
the
ball
the
charlestonian
made
a
quick
dash
to
get
back
to
third
but
sleepy
had
the
ball
in
the
third
baseman
hands
before
him
now
the
third
baseman
saw
that
the
second
kingston
runner
had
also
been
wavering
uncertainly
between
second
and
third
ready
to
reach
third
if
sleepy
threw
for
home
and
to
return
to
second
if
he
threw
to
third
the
third
baseman
started
toward
the
runner
making
many
pretenses
of
throwing
the
ball
and
keeping
the
poor
on
such
a
of
uncertainty
that
he
actually
allowed
himself
to
be
touched
out
with
barely
a
wriggle
this
double
play
retired
the
side
it
was
credited
to
the
third
baseman
but
the
real
glory
belonged
to
sleepy
and
the
crowd
gave
him
the
applause
once
more
towered
at
the
bat
he
was
willing
to
take
another
bruise
if
he
could
be
assured
of
getting
to
first
base
but
the
pitcher
was
so
wary
of
striking
him
this
time
that
he
gave
him
his
base
on
balls
and
lifted
his
hat
to
him
in
gratitude
for
this
second
gift
the
knocked
a
fly
into
the
hands
of
the
first
baseman
who
stood
on
the
bag
barely
escaped
falling
victim
to
a
double
play
by
beating
the
fly
to
first
again
jumbo
labored
mightily
to
advance
and
did
indeed
get
him
to
second
on
a
the
next
kingstonian
however
the
third
baseman
knocked
to
the
second
baseman
a
that
was
so
straight
and
hot
that
the
second
baseman
could
neither
have
dodged
nor
missed
it
had
he
tried
so
he
just
held
on
to
it
and
set
his
foot
on
the
bag
and
caught
before
he
could
get
back
to
the
base
the
fourth
inning
was
opened
by
a
charlestonian
who
sent
a
singing
fly
right
over
head
he
seemed
to
double
his
length
like
a
when
he
shut
up
again
however
the
ball
was
not
in
his
hand
but
down
in
the
it
was
a
master
stroke
but
worth
only
one
base
to
charleston
the
second
man
at
the
bat
fell
prey
to
reddy
bewildering
curves
and
reddy
heard
again
that
sweetest
sound
a
pitcher
can
hear
the
voice
crying
striker
out
the
charlestonian
who
had
lined
out
the
beautiful
proved
himself
the
possessor
of
a
pair
of
heels
as
good
as
his
pair
of
eyes
and
just
as
reddy
had
declared
by
his
motions
such
a
readiness
to
pitch
the
ball
that
he
could
not
have
changed
his
mind
without
being
declared
guilty
of
a
balk
just
at
that
instant
the
charlestonian
dashed
madly
for
second
base
heady
snatched
off
his
mask
and
threw
the
ball
to
second
with
all
the
speed
and
correctness
he
was
master
of
but
the
throw
went
just
so
far
to
the
right
that
tug
leaning
far
out
could
not
recover
himself
in
time
to
touch
the
runner
illustration
out
these
two
now
began
to
play
a
game
of
about
second
base
much
to
reddy
discomfort
there
is
nothing
so
annoying
to
a
pitcher
as
the
presence
of
a
courageous
and
speedy
on
the
second
base
for
the
pitcher
has
always
the
threefold
terror
that
in
whirling
suddenly
he
may
be
found
guilty
of
balking
or
in
facing
about
quickly
he
may
make
a
wild
throw
and
yet
if
he
does
not
keep
a
sharp
eye
in
the
back
of
his
head
the
can
play
off
far
enough
to
stand
a
good
chance
of
stealing
third
safely
reddy
engaged
in
this
duel
so
ardently
that
before
he
knew
it
he
had
given
the
man
at
the
bat
a
base
on
balls
this
added
to
his
confusion
and
seeing
at
the
bat
the
charleston
catcher
who
had
in
the
second
inning
knocked
out
a
perfect
and
made
two
bases
on
it
reddy
left
the
wily
fox
at
second
base
to
his
own
devices
and
paid
no
heed
to
tug
efforts
to
beat
the
man
back
to
second
suddenly
the
fellow
made
a
dart
for
third
though
heady
throw
was
straight
and
swift
the
fellow
dived
for
the
base
and
slid
into
safety
under
the
ball
in
the
shadow
of
this
dash
the
other
charleston
took
second
base
without
protest
the
charleston
catcher
was
evidently
determined
to
bring
in
at
least
one
run
or
die
trying
he
smashed
at
every
ball
that
reddy
pitched
he
only
succeeded
however
in
making
a
number
of
fouls
but
reddy
shuddered
for
the
score
when
he
realized
how
well
the
charleston
catcher
was
studying
his
best
curves
suddenly
the
man
struck
up
a
foul
everybody
yelled
at
once
over
your
head
and
heady
ripping
away
his
mask
again
whirled
round
and
round
trying
to
find
the
little
globule
in
the
dazzling
sky
he
gimleted
all
over
the
space
back
of
the
plate
before
he
finally
made
out
the
ball
coming
to
earth
many
feet
in
front
of
him
he
made
a
desperate
lunge
for
it
and
caught
it
and
reddy
groan
of
relief
could
be
heard
clear
from
the
pitcher
box
the
charleston
catcher
in
a
great
huff
threw
his
bat
to
the
ground
with
such
violence
that
it
broke
and
he
gave
way
to
the
second
baseman
who
had
made
a
sacrifice
hit
in
the
second
inning
which
advanced
the
catcher
one
base
the
man
realized
however
that
a
sacrifice
in
this
inning
with
two
men
already
out
would
not
be
so
advantageous
as
before
he
made
an
heroic
attempt
resulting
in
a
clean
drive
that
hummed
past
reddy
like
a
mauser
bullet
and
chose
a
path
exactly
between
jumbo
and
tug
it
was
evident
that
no
kingston
man
could
stop
it
in
time
to
throw
either
to
first
base
or
home
ahead
of
a
charleston
man
but
since
kingston
could
not
put
the
side
out
before
a
run
was
scored
the
charlestonians
cheerfully
consented
to
put
themselves
out
that
is
the
on
second
making
a
furious
dash
for
third
ran
into
the
ball
which
recorded
itself
on
his
when
he
fell
to
the
ground
yelping
with
torment
i
am
afraid
that
the
kingstonians
showed
little
of
the
good
samaritan
spirit
for
the
and
the
kingston
sympathizers
in
the
crowd
indulged
in
a
jubilation
such
as
a
roman
throng
gave
vent
to
when
a
favorite
gladiator
had
floored
some
new
savage
the
kingston
men
came
in
from
the
field
arm
in
arm
but
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
once
more
sauntering
out
into
the
field
for
not
one
of
them
reached
first
base
a
game
without
runs
is
not
usually
half
so
interesting
to
the
crowd
as
one
in
which
there
is
free
batting
and
a
generous
sprinkling
of
runs
the
average
spectator
is
not
sport
enough
to
feel
sorry
for
the
pitcher
when
a
home
run
has
been
knocked
over
the
fence
or
to
feel
sorry
for
a
fielder
who
lets
a
ball
through
his
fingers
and
sends
the
on
their
way
rejoicing
to
your
thorough
sport
though
a
scientific
game
is
the
most
interesting
he
likes
to
see
runs
earned
if
scored
at
all
and
has
sympathy
but
no
interest
for
a
pitcher
who
permits
himself
to
be
knocked
out
of
the
box
a
more
nicely
balanced
game
than
this
between
kingston
and
charleston
could
hardly
be
imagined
and
there
was
something
in
the
air
or
in
the
game
that
made
the
young
teams
play
like
veterans
each
worked
together
like
a
clock
of
nine
though
the
next
four
innings
were
altogether
different
from
one
another
in
batting
and
fielding
they
were
exactly
alike
in
that
they
were
all
totaled
at
the
bottom
of
the
column
with
a
large
blank
at
the
opening
of
the
ninth
inning
even
the
uncultured
members
of
the
crowd
those
unscientific
ingoramuses
that
had
voted
the
game
a
dull
one
because
no
one
had
made
the
circuit
of
the
bases
even
these
sat
up
and
breathed
fast
and
wondered
what
was
going
to
happen
they
had
not
drawn
many
breaths
before
the
kingston
catcher
rapped
on
the
plate
and
threw
back
his
bat
to
knock
the
stuffing
out
of
any
ball
that
reddy
might
hurl
at
him
and
indeed
his
intentions
were
nearly
realized
for
the
very
first
throw
that
reddy
made
hit
the
on
the
charleston
bat
and
then
leaped
away
with
a
thwack
reddy
leaped
for
it
first
but
it
went
far
from
his
fingers
next
after
him
tug
went
up
into
the
air
and
fell
back
beautifully
and
after
him
just
as
if
they
had
been
the
bounded
high
and
clutched
at
the
ball
but
past
his
too
it
went
and
he
turned
ignominiously
after
it
if
he
was
running
the
charlestonian
was
flying
he
shot
across
first
base
and
on
just
grazing
second
base
unseen
by
tug
who
had
turned
his
back
and
was
yelling
vainly
to
the
to
throw
him
the
ball
he
had
not
yet
caught
up
with
on
the
charlestonian
sped
in
a
blind
hurry
he
very
much
resembled
a
young
man
decidedly
anxious
to
get
home
as
soon
as
possible
he
flew
past
third
base
and
on
down
like
an
antelope
to
the
plate
this
he
spurned
with
his
toe
as
he
ran
on
unable
to
check
his
furious
impetus
until
he
fell
in
the
arms
of
the
other
charleston
players
on
the
bench
and
then
the
charleston
faction
in
the
crowd
raised
crawled
in
at
the
back
door
and
been
ousted
unceremoniously
the
kingstonians
had
certainly
played
a
beautiful
game
but
the
charlestonians
had
played
one
quite
as
good
all
that
the
could
do
when
they
saw
their
nine
come
to
the
bat
for
the
ninth
time
was
to
look
uncomfortable
mop
their
brows
and
remark
whew
the
kingstonian
was
the
first
to
the
bat
and
he
struck
out
then
jumbo
appeared
and
played
a
waiting
game
he
was
very
fond
of
while
pretending
to
be
willing
to
hit
anything
that
was
pitched
he
almost
always
let
the
ball
go
by
him
and
since
he
was
so
short
and
stocky
built
so
close
to
the
ground
as
he
expressed
it
the
pitcher
usually
threw
too
high
and
jumbo
got
his
base
on
balls
a
dozen
times
where
he
earned
it
with
a
or
lost
it
on
a
and
now
he
reached
first
base
in
his
old
pet
way
and
made
ardent
preparations
to
steal
second
but
his
enterprise
was
for
the
kingston
third
baseman
knocked
an
easy
grounder
to
the
who
picked
it
from
the
ground
and
tossed
it
into
the
second
hands
almost
with
one
motion
and
the
second
baseman
just
touching
the
base
with
his
toe
to
put
jumbo
out
on
a
forced
run
made
a
clean
throw
to
first
that
put
out
the
batsman
also
and
with
him
the
side
the
scientists
marked
down
upon
the
calendars
of
their
memory
the
fact
that
they
had
seen
two
preparatory
school
teams
play
a
game
without
scoring
a
run
the
others
in
the
crowd
only
felt
sick
with
hope
deferred
and
wondered
if
that
home
plate
were
going
to
be
as
difficult
to
reach
as
the
north
pole
the
charleston
third
baseman
came
to
the
bat
first
for
his
side
in
the
tenth
inning
and
he
struck
out
the
followed
him
and
by
knocking
a
little
bunt
that
buzzed
like
a
top
just
in
front
of
the
plate
managed
to
agonize
his
way
to
first
base
before
reddy
and
heady
could
field
the
ball
both
of
them
having
jumped
for
it
and
reached
it
at
the
same
time
but
this
man
making
a
rash
and
foolish
effort
to
steal
second
was
given
the
punishment
of
death
for
theft
heady
having
made
a
perfect
throw
from
the
plate
the
charleston
reached
second
on
a
fly
muffed
by
the
kingston
the
first
error
made
by
this
excellent
player
and
now
once
more
the
redoubtable
charleston
catcher
appeared
at
the
bat
once
more
he
showed
his
understanding
of
reddy
science
this
time
he
was
evidently
determined
to
wipe
out
the
mistake
he
had
made
of
too
great
haste
on
his
previous
home
runs
after
warming
up
with
two
strikes
and
letting
three
balls
pass
he
found
the
ball
where
he
wanted
it
and
drove
out
into
a
magnificent
fly
pretty
saw
it
coming
and
turning
ran
to
the
best
of
his
ability
for
the
uttermost
edge
of
his
field
hoping
only
to
delay
the
course
of
the
ball
at
length
it
overtook
him
and
even
as
he
ran
he
sprang
into
the
air
and
clutched
upward
for
it
and
struck
it
as
if
he
would
bat
it
back
to
the
home
plate
it
did
not
stick
to
his
fingers
but
none
of
the
scorers
counted
it
as
an
error
on
the
clean
square
beside
his
name
under
the
letter
he
had
not
achieved
the
impossible
of
catching
it
but
he
had
done
the
next
best
thing
he
had
knocked
it
to
the
ground
and
run
it
down
in
two
or
three
steps
and
turned
and
drawing
backward
till
the
ball
almost
touched
the
ground
behind
him
had
strained
every
muscle
with
a
furious
lunge
and
sent
the
ball
flying
for
home
in
a
desperate
race
with
the
charleston
who
had
passed
third
base
and
was
sprinting
for
dear
life
homeward
at
the
plate
stood
heady
beckoning
the
home
with
frantic
hope
and
reddy
both
rushing
to
get
behind
him
and
back
him
up
so
that
at
least
not
more
than
one
run
should
be
scored
with
a
gasp
of
resolve
the
charleston
runner
seeing
by
heady
eyes
that
the
ball
was
just
at
hand
flung
himself
to
the
ground
hoping
to
lay
at
least
a
on
the
plate
but
there
was
a
quick
thwack
as
the
ball
struck
heady
gloves
there
was
a
stinging
blow
at
the
charlestonian
right
and
the
shrill
cry
of
the
umpire
out
once
more
the
spectators
shifted
in
their
seats
and
knit
their
brows
and
observed
whew
and
now
sleepy
opened
the
second
half
of
the
tenth
inning
he
had
a
little
splutter
of
applause
for
his
magnificent
throw
when
he
came
to
the
plate
but
he
either
was
dreaming
of
and
did
not
hear
it
or
was
too
lazy
to
lift
his
cap
for
he
made
no
sign
of
recognition
he
made
a
sign
of
recognition
of
the
pitcher
first
upshoot
however
for
he
sent
it
spinning
leisurely
down
into
so
leisurely
that
even
he
beat
it
to
first
base
the
kingston
now
atoned
for
his
previous
error
by
a
ringing
hit
that
took
sleepy
on
a
comfortable
jog
to
second
base
and
placed
himself
safely
on
first
then
reddy
came
to
the
bat
he
was
saved
the
chagrin
of
striking
out
to
his
deadly
rival
but
the
hit
he
knocked
was
only
a
little
fly
that
the
pitcher
caught
the
two
however
had
not
had
great
expectations
of
reddy
batting
prowess
so
they
did
not
stray
far
from
their
bases
and
were
not
caught
napping
now
tug
came
to
the
bat
and
while
he
was
gathering
his
strength
for
a
blow
at
the
ball
the
two
made
ready
to
take
advantage
of
anything
he
should
hit
the
played
off
too
far
and
to
tug
despair
was
caught
by
a
quick
throw
from
the
pitcher
to
the
first
baseman
tug
heart
turned
sick
within
him
for
there
were
two
men
out
and
the
only
man
on
base
was
sleepy
who
could
never
be
counted
on
to
make
a
run
on
a
hit
as
tug
stood
bewailing
his
fate
the
ball
shot
past
him
and
the
umpire
cried
strike
one
tug
shook
himself
together
with
a
jolt
and
struck
furiously
at
the
next
ball
strike
two
sang
the
umpire
and
now
the
umpire
had
upon
his
lips
the
fatal
words
strike
three
for
as
he
looked
down
the
line
traced
in
the
air
by
the
ball
he
saw
that
tug
had
misjudged
it
but
for
once
science
meant
suicide
for
though
tug
struck
wildly
the
ball
condescendingly
curved
down
and
fell
full
and
fair
upon
the
bat
and
danced
off
again
over
the
first
baseman
head
and
toward
the
feet
of
the
this
worthy
player
ran
swiftly
for
it
and
bent
forward
but
he
could
not
reach
it
it
struck
him
a
smarting
whack
on
the
instep
and
bounded
off
outside
the
and
while
he
limped
painfully
after
it
there
was
time
even
for
the
sleepy
sleepy
to
reach
the
plate
and
score
a
run
and
then
the
half
blinded
with
pain
threw
the
ball
at
nobody
in
particular
and
it
went
into
the
crowd
back
of
third
base
and
tug
came
in
unopposed
and
since
the
game
was
now
kingston
no
one
waited
to
see
whether
heady
would
have
knocked
a
home
run
or
struck
out
he
was
not
given
a
chance
to
bat
conclusion
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
kingston
that
night
much
croaking
of
tin
horns
and
much
building
of
bonfires
the
athletic
year
had
been
remarkably
successful
and
every
one
realized
the
vital
part
played
in
that
success
by
the
men
from
lakerim
the
dozen
who
had
made
some
enemies
as
all
active
people
must
and
had
made
many
more
friends
as
all
active
people
may
the
rejoicing
of
the
lakerimmers
themselves
had
a
faint
tang
of
regret
for
while
they
were
all
to
go
back
to
the
same
town
together
for
their
vacation
yet
they
knew
that
this
would
be
the
last
year
of
school
life
they
could
ever
spend
together
next
year
history
punk
and
jumbo
were
to
go
to
college
the
others
had
at
least
one
more
year
of
preparatory
work
and
they
thought
too
that
this
first
separation
into
two
parts
was
only
the
beginning
of
many
separations
that
should
finally
scatter
them
perhaps
over
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
there
was
bobbles
for
instance
who
had
an
uncle
that
was
a
great
sugar
magnate
in
the
hawaiian
islands
and
had
offered
him
a
position
there
whenever
he
was
ready
for
it
had
been
promised
an
appointment
to
annapolis
for
he
would
be
a
sailor
and
an
officer
of
uncle
sam
navy
and
tug
had
been
offered
a
chance
to
try
for
west
point
and
there
were
no
dangers
for
him
in
either
the
rigid
mental
or
the
physical
examinations
pretty
who
had
shown
a
wonderful
gift
for
modeling
in
clay
was
going
some
day
to
paris
to
study
sculpture
and
quiz
looked
forward
to
being
a
lawyer
the
twins
would
go
into
business
since
their
father
busy
sawmill
property
would
descend
to
both
of
them
and
as
they
thought
it
out
could
not
very
well
be
divided
plainly
they
must
make
the
best
of
life
together
it
promised
to
be
a
lively
existence
but
a
pleasant
one
withal
history
hoped
to
be
a
great
writer
some
day
and
punk
would
be
a
professor
of
something
staid
and
quiet
latin
most
probably
and
jumbo
had
not
made
up
their
minds
as
to
just
what
the
future
was
to
hold
for
them
but
they
agreed
that
it
must
be
something
in
partnership
sleepy
had
never
a
fancy
of
what
coming
years
should
bring
him
to
do
he
preferred
to
postpone
the
unpleasant
task
of
making
up
his
mind
and
only
took
the
trouble
to
hope
that
the
future
would
give
him
something
that
offered
plenty
of
time
for
sleeping
and
eating
late
into
the
night
the
twelve
sat
around
a
waving
bonfire
their
eyes
twinkling
at
the
memory
of
old
victories
and
defeats
of
struggles
that
were
pleasant
whatever
their
outcome
just
because
they
were
struggles
at
length
sleepy
got
himself
to
his
feet
with
much
difficulty
going
to
bed
jumbo
sang
out
nope
drawled
sleepy
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
they
all
smiled
at
the
thought
of
him
whom
none
of
them
respected
and
all
of
them
loved
in
a
space
of
time
quite
short
for
him
sleepy
returned
with
an
of
books
the
that
had
given
him
so
much
trouble
and
would
have
given
him
more
had
they
had
the
chance
offered
them
fire
getting
low
was
all
he
said
and
he
dumped
the
every
one
into
the
blaze
the
other
lakerimmers
knew
that
they
had
passed
every
examination
either
brilliantly
or
at
the
worst
well
enough
to
scrape
through
sleepy
did
not
even
know
whether
he
had
failed
or
not
but
the
next
morning
he
found
out
that
he
should
sadly
need
next
year
those
books
that
were
charred
ashes
in
a
corner
of
the
campus
and
should
have
to
replace
them
out
of
his
that
night
however
he
was
blissful
with
ignorance
and
having
made
a
pyre
of
his
bookish
tormentors
he
fell
in
with
the
jollity
of
the
others
when
it
grew
very
late
silence
gradually
fell
on
the
gossipy
twelve
the
beauty
of
the
night
and
the
union
of
souls
seemed
to
be
speech
enough
finally
the
fire
fell
asleep
and
with
one
mind
they
all
rose
and
standing
in
a
circle
about
glimmering
ashes
clasped
hands
in
eternal
friendship
and
said
good
night
the
home
plate
