preface
in
reprinting
this
story
for
a
new
edition
i
am
reminded
that
it
was
in
the
chapters
of
from
the
madding
crowd
as
they
appeared
month
by
month
in
a
popular
magazine
that
i
first
ventured
to
adopt
the
word
from
the
pages
of
early
english
history
and
give
it
a
fictitious
significance
as
the
existing
name
of
the
district
once
included
in
that
extinct
kingdom
the
series
of
novels
i
projected
being
mainly
of
the
kind
called
local
they
seemed
to
require
a
territorial
definition
of
some
sort
to
lend
unity
to
their
scene
finding
that
the
area
of
a
single
county
did
not
afford
a
canvas
large
enough
for
this
purpose
and
that
there
were
objections
to
an
invented
name
i
disinterred
the
old
one
the
press
and
the
public
were
kind
enough
to
welcome
the
fanciful
plan
and
willingly
joined
me
in
the
anachronism
of
imagining
a
wessex
population
living
under
queen
victoria
modern
wessex
of
railways
the
penny
post
mowing
and
reaping
machines
union
workhouses
lucifer
matches
labourers
who
could
read
and
write
and
national
school
children
but
i
believe
i
am
correct
in
stating
that
until
the
existence
of
this
contemporaneous
wessex
was
announced
in
the
present
story
in
it
had
never
been
heard
of
and
that
the
expression
wessex
peasant
or
wessex
custom
would
theretofore
have
been
taken
to
refer
to
nothing
later
in
date
than
the
norman
conquest
i
did
not
anticipate
that
this
application
of
the
word
to
a
modern
use
would
extend
outside
the
chapters
of
my
own
chronicles
but
the
name
was
soon
taken
up
elsewhere
as
a
local
designation
the
first
to
do
so
was
the
now
defunct
which
in
the
impression
bearing
date
july
entitled
one
of
its
articles
wessex
labourer
the
article
turning
out
to
be
no
dissertation
on
farming
during
the
heptarchy
but
on
the
modern
peasant
of
the
counties
and
his
presentation
in
these
stories
since
then
the
appellation
which
i
had
thought
to
reserve
to
the
horizons
and
landscapes
of
a
merely
realistic
has
become
more
and
more
popular
as
a
practical
definition
and
the
has
by
degrees
solidified
into
a
utilitarian
region
which
people
can
go
to
take
a
house
in
and
write
to
the
papers
from
but
i
ask
all
good
and
gentle
readers
to
be
so
kind
as
to
forget
this
and
to
refuse
steadfastly
to
believe
that
there
are
any
inhabitants
of
a
victorian
wessex
outside
the
pages
of
this
and
the
companion
volumes
in
which
they
were
first
discovered
moreover
the
village
called
weatherbury
wherein
the
scenes
of
the
present
story
of
the
series
are
for
the
most
part
laid
would
perhaps
be
hardly
discernible
by
the
explorer
without
help
in
any
existing
place
nowadays
though
at
the
time
comparatively
recent
at
which
the
tale
was
written
a
sufficient
reality
to
meet
the
descriptions
both
of
backgrounds
and
personages
might
have
been
traced
easily
enough
the
church
remains
by
great
good
fortune
unrestored
and
intact
and
a
few
of
the
old
houses
but
the
ancient
which
was
formerly
so
characteristic
of
the
parish
has
been
pulled
down
these
twenty
years
also
most
of
the
thatched
and
dormered
cottages
that
were
once
lifeholds
the
game
of
base
which
not
so
long
ago
seemed
to
enjoy
a
perennial
vitality
in
front
of
the
stocks
may
so
far
as
i
can
say
be
entirely
unknown
to
the
rising
generation
of
schoolboys
there
the
practice
of
divination
by
bible
and
key
the
regarding
of
valentines
as
things
of
serious
import
the
and
the
have
too
nearly
disappeared
in
the
wake
of
the
old
houses
and
with
them
have
gone
it
is
said
much
of
that
love
of
fuddling
to
which
the
village
at
one
time
was
notoriously
prone
the
change
at
the
root
of
this
has
been
the
recent
supplanting
of
the
class
of
stationary
cottagers
who
carried
on
the
local
traditions
and
humours
by
a
population
of
more
or
less
migratory
labourers
which
has
led
to
a
break
of
continuity
in
local
history
more
fatal
than
any
other
thing
to
the
preservation
of
legend
close
relations
and
eccentric
individualities
for
these
the
indispensable
conditions
of
existence
are
attachment
to
the
soil
of
one
particular
spot

description
of
farmer
incident
when
farmer
oak
smiled
the
corners
of
his
mouth
spread
till
they
were
within
an
unimportant
distance
of
his
ears
his
eyes
were
reduced
to
chinks
and
diverging
wrinkles
appeared
round
them
extending
upon
his
countenance
like
the
rays
in
a
rudimentary
sketch
of
the
rising
sun
his
christian
name
was
gabriel
and
on
working
days
he
was
a
young
man
of
sound
judgment
easy
motions
proper
dress
and
general
good
character
on
sundays
he
was
a
man
of
misty
views
rather
given
to
postponing
and
hampered
by
his
best
clothes
and
umbrella
upon
the
whole
one
who
felt
himself
to
occupy
morally
that
vast
middle
space
of
laodicean
neutrality
which
lay
between
the
communion
people
of
the
parish
and
the
drunken
section
is
he
went
to
church
but
yawned
privately
by
the
time
the
congregation
reached
the
nicene
creed
and
thought
of
what
there
would
be
for
dinner
when
he
meant
to
be
listening
to
the
sermon
or
to
state
his
character
as
it
stood
in
the
scale
of
public
opinion
when
his
friends
and
critics
were
in
tantrums
he
was
considered
rather
a
bad
man
when
they
were
pleased
he
was
rather
a
good
man
when
they
were
neither
he
was
a
man
whose
moral
colour
was
a
kind
of
mixture
since
he
lived
six
times
as
many
as
sundays
appearance
in
his
old
clothes
was
most
peculiarly
his
mental
picture
formed
by
his
neighbours
in
imagining
him
being
always
dressed
in
that
way
he
wore
a
felt
hat
spread
out
at
the
base
by
tight
jamming
upon
the
head
for
security
in
high
winds
and
a
coat
like
his
lower
extremities
being
encased
in
ordinary
leather
leggings
and
boots
emphatically
large
affording
to
each
foot
a
roomy
apartment
so
constructed
that
any
wearer
might
stand
in
a
river
all
day
long
and
know
nothing
of
maker
being
a
conscientious
man
who
endeavoured
to
compensate
for
any
weakness
in
his
cut
by
unstinted
dimension
and
solidity
oak
carried
about
him
by
way
of
watch
what
may
be
called
a
small
silver
clock
in
other
words
it
was
a
watch
as
to
shape
and
intention
and
a
small
clock
as
to
size
this
instrument
being
several
years
older
than
grandfather
had
the
peculiarity
of
going
either
too
fast
or
not
at
all
the
smaller
of
its
hands
too
occasionally
slipped
round
on
the
pivot
and
thus
though
the
minutes
were
told
with
precision
nobody
could
be
quite
certain
of
the
hour
they
belonged
to
the
stopping
peculiarity
of
his
watch
oak
remedied
by
thumps
and
shakes
and
he
escaped
any
evil
consequences
from
the
other
two
defects
by
constant
comparisons
with
and
observations
of
the
sun
and
stars
and
by
pressing
his
face
close
to
the
glass
of
his
windows
till
he
could
discern
the
hour
marked
by
the
timekeepers
within
it
may
be
mentioned
that
fob
being
difficult
of
access
by
reason
of
its
somewhat
high
situation
in
the
waistband
of
his
trousers
which
also
lay
at
a
remote
height
under
his
waistcoat
the
watch
was
as
a
necessity
pulled
out
by
throwing
the
body
to
one
side
compressing
the
mouth
and
face
to
a
mere
mass
of
ruddy
flesh
on
account
of
the
exertion
required
and
drawing
up
the
watch
by
its
chain
like
a
bucket
from
a
well
but
some
thoughtful
persons
who
had
seen
him
walking
across
one
of
his
fields
on
a
certain
december
and
exceedingly
have
regarded
gabriel
oak
in
other
aspects
than
these
in
his
face
one
might
notice
that
many
of
the
hues
and
curves
of
youth
had
tarried
on
to
manhood
there
even
remained
in
his
remoter
crannies
some
relics
of
the
boy
his
height
and
breadth
would
have
been
sufficient
to
make
his
presence
imposing
had
they
been
exhibited
with
due
consideration
but
there
is
a
way
some
men
have
rural
and
urban
alike
for
which
the
mind
is
more
responsible
than
flesh
and
sinew
it
is
a
way
of
curtailing
their
dimensions
by
their
manner
of
showing
them
and
from
a
quiet
modesty
that
would
have
become
a
vestal
which
seemed
continually
to
impress
upon
him
that
he
had
no
great
claim
on
the
room
oak
walked
unassumingly
and
with
a
faintly
perceptible
bend
yet
distinct
from
a
bowing
of
the
shoulders
this
may
be
said
to
be
a
defect
in
an
individual
if
he
depends
for
his
valuation
more
upon
his
appearance
than
upon
his
capacity
to
wear
well
which
oak
did
not
he
had
just
reached
the
time
of
life
at
which
is
ceasing
to
be
the
prefix
of
in
speaking
of
one
he
was
at
the
brightest
period
of
masculine
growth
for
his
intellect
and
his
emotions
were
clearly
separated
he
had
passed
the
time
during
which
the
influence
of
youth
indiscriminately
mingles
them
in
the
character
of
impulse
and
he
had
not
yet
arrived
at
the
stage
wherein
they
become
united
again
in
the
character
of
prejudice
by
the
influence
of
a
wife
and
family
in
short
he
was
and
a
bachelor
the
field
he
was
in
this
morning
sloped
to
a
ridge
called
norcombe
hill
through
a
spur
of
this
hill
ran
the
highway
between
emminster
and
casually
glancing
over
the
hedge
oak
saw
coming
down
the
incline
before
him
an
ornamental
spring
waggon
painted
yellow
and
gaily
marked
drawn
by
two
horses
a
waggoner
walking
alongside
bearing
a
whip
perpendicularly
the
waggon
was
laden
with
household
goods
and
window
plants
and
on
the
apex
of
the
whole
sat
a
woman
young
and
attractive
gabriel
had
not
beheld
the
sight
for
more
than
half
a
minute
when
the
vehicle
was
brought
to
a
standstill
just
beneath
his
eyes
tailboard
of
the
waggon
is
gone
miss
said
the
waggoner
i
heard
it
fall
said
the
girl
in
a
soft
though
not
particularly
low
voice
heard
a
noise
i
could
not
account
for
when
we
were
coming
up
the
run
she
answered
the
sensible
horses
still
and
the
steps
sank
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
distance
the
girl
on
the
summit
of
the
load
sat
motionless
surrounded
by
tables
and
chairs
with
their
legs
upwards
backed
by
an
oak
settle
and
ornamented
in
front
by
pots
of
geraniums
myrtles
and
cactuses
together
with
a
caged
probably
from
the
windows
of
the
house
just
vacated
there
was
also
a
cat
in
a
willow
basket
from
the
lid
of
which
she
gazed
with
eyes
and
affectionately
surveyed
the
small
birds
around
the
handsome
girl
waited
for
some
time
idly
in
her
place
and
the
only
sound
heard
in
the
stillness
was
the
hopping
of
the
canary
up
and
down
the
perches
of
its
prison
then
she
looked
attentively
downwards
it
was
not
at
the
bird
nor
at
the
cat
it
was
at
an
oblong
package
tied
in
paper
and
lying
between
them
she
turned
her
head
to
learn
if
the
waggoner
were
coming
he
was
not
yet
in
sight
and
her
eyes
crept
back
to
the
package
her
thoughts
seeming
to
run
upon
what
was
inside
it
at
length
she
drew
the
article
into
her
lap
and
untied
the
paper
covering
a
small
swing
was
disclosed
in
which
she
proceeded
to
survey
herself
attentively
she
parted
her
lips
and
smiled
it
was
a
fine
morning
and
the
sun
lighted
up
to
a
scarlet
glow
the
crimson
jacket
she
wore
and
painted
a
soft
lustre
upon
her
bright
face
and
dark
hair
the
myrtles
geraniums
and
cactuses
packed
around
her
were
fresh
and
green
and
at
such
a
leafless
season
they
invested
the
whole
concern
of
horses
waggon
furniture
and
girl
with
a
peculiar
vernal
charm
what
possessed
her
to
indulge
in
such
a
performance
in
the
sight
of
the
sparrows
blackbirds
and
unperceived
farmer
who
were
alone
its
spectators
the
smile
began
as
a
factitious
one
to
test
her
capacity
in
that
art
knows
it
ended
certainly
in
a
real
smile
she
blushed
at
herself
and
seeing
her
reflection
blush
blushed
the
more
the
change
from
the
customary
spot
and
necessary
occasion
of
such
an
the
dressing
hour
in
a
bedroom
to
a
time
of
travelling
out
of
to
the
idle
deed
a
novelty
it
did
not
intrinsically
possess
the
picture
was
a
delicate
one
prescriptive
infirmity
had
stalked
into
the
sunlight
which
had
clothed
it
in
the
freshness
of
an
originality
a
cynical
inference
was
irresistible
by
gabriel
oak
as
he
regarded
the
scene
generous
though
he
fain
would
have
been
there
was
no
necessity
whatever
for
her
looking
in
the
glass
she
did
not
adjust
her
hat
or
pat
her
hair
or
press
a
dimple
into
shape
or
do
one
thing
to
signify
that
any
such
intention
had
been
her
motive
in
taking
up
the
glass
she
simply
observed
herself
as
a
fair
product
of
nature
in
the
feminine
kind
her
thoughts
seeming
to
glide
into
though
likely
dramas
in
which
men
would
play
a
of
probable
smiles
being
of
a
phase
suggesting
that
hearts
were
imagined
as
lost
and
won
still
this
was
but
conjecture
and
the
whole
series
of
actions
was
so
idly
put
forth
as
to
make
it
rash
to
assert
that
intention
had
any
part
in
them
at
all
the
steps
were
heard
returning
she
put
the
glass
in
the
paper
and
the
whole
again
into
its
place
when
the
waggon
had
passed
on
gabriel
withdrew
from
his
point
of
espial
and
descending
into
the
road
followed
the
vehicle
to
the
some
way
beyond
the
bottom
of
the
hill
where
the
object
of
his
contemplation
now
halted
for
the
payment
of
toll
about
twenty
steps
still
remained
between
him
and
the
gate
when
he
heard
a
dispute
it
was
a
difference
concerning
twopence
between
the
persons
with
the
waggon
and
the
man
at
the
niece
is
upon
the
top
of
the
things
and
she
says
enough
that
offered
ye
you
great
miser
and
she
pay
any
these
were
the
words
well
then
niece
pass
said
the
closing
the
gate
oak
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
disputants
and
fell
into
a
reverie
there
was
something
in
the
tone
of
twopence
remarkably
insignificant
threepence
had
a
definite
value
as
was
an
appreciable
infringement
on
a
wages
and
as
such
a
higgling
matter
but
he
said
stepping
forward
and
handing
twopence
to
the
gatekeeper
the
young
woman
he
looked
up
at
her
then
she
heard
his
words
and
looked
down
features
adhered
throughout
their
form
so
exactly
to
the
middle
line
between
the
beauty
of
john
and
the
ugliness
of
judas
iscariot
as
represented
in
a
window
of
the
church
he
attended
that
not
a
single
lineament
could
be
selected
and
called
worthy
either
of
distinction
or
notoriety
the
and
maiden
seemed
to
think
so
too
for
she
carelessly
glanced
over
him
and
told
her
man
to
drive
on
she
might
have
looked
her
thanks
to
gabriel
on
a
minute
scale
but
she
did
not
speak
them
more
probably
she
felt
none
for
in
gaining
her
a
passage
he
had
lost
her
her
point
and
we
know
how
women
take
a
favour
of
that
kind
the
gatekeeper
surveyed
the
retreating
vehicle
a
handsome
maid
he
said
to
oak
she
has
her
faults
said
gabriel
the
greatest
of
them
what
it
is
people
down
ay
then
gabriel
perhaps
a
little
piqued
by
the
comely
indifference
glanced
back
to
where
he
had
witnessed
her
performance
over
the
hedge
and
said
chapter
ii
interior
it
was
nearly
midnight
on
the
eve
of
the
shortest
day
in
the
year
a
desolating
wind
wandered
from
the
north
over
the
hill
whereon
oak
had
watched
the
yellow
waggon
and
its
occupant
in
the
sunshine
of
a
few
days
earlier
norcombe
far
from
lonely
one
of
the
spots
which
suggest
to
a
that
he
is
in
the
presence
of
a
shape
approaching
the
indestructible
as
nearly
as
any
to
be
found
on
earth
it
was
a
featureless
convexity
of
chalk
and
ordinary
specimen
of
those
protuberances
of
the
globe
which
may
remain
undisturbed
on
some
great
day
of
confusion
when
far
grander
heights
and
dizzy
granite
precipices
topple
down
the
hill
was
covered
on
its
northern
side
by
an
ancient
and
decaying
plantation
of
beeches
whose
upper
verge
formed
a
line
over
the
crest
fringing
its
arched
curve
against
the
sky
like
a
mane
these
trees
sheltered
the
southern
slope
from
the
keenest
blasts
which
smote
the
wood
and
floundered
through
it
with
a
sound
as
of
grumbling
or
gushed
over
its
crowning
boughs
in
a
weakened
moan
the
dry
leaves
in
the
ditch
simmered
and
boiled
in
the
same
breezes
a
tongue
of
air
occasionally
ferreting
out
a
few
and
sending
them
spinning
across
the
grass
a
group
or
two
of
the
latest
in
date
amongst
the
dead
multitude
had
remained
till
this
very
time
on
the
twigs
which
bore
them
and
in
falling
rattled
against
the
trunks
with
smart
taps
between
this
hill
and
the
vague
still
horizon
that
its
summit
indistinctly
commanded
was
a
mysterious
sheet
of
fathomless
sounds
from
which
suggested
that
what
it
concealed
bore
some
reduced
resemblance
to
features
here
the
thin
grasses
more
or
less
coating
the
hill
were
touched
by
the
wind
in
breezes
of
differing
powers
and
almost
of
differing
rubbing
the
blades
heavily
another
raking
them
piercingly
another
brushing
them
like
a
soft
broom
the
instinctive
act
of
humankind
was
to
stand
and
listen
and
learn
how
the
trees
on
the
right
and
the
trees
on
the
left
wailed
or
chaunted
to
each
other
in
the
regular
antiphonies
of
a
cathedral
choir
how
hedges
and
other
shapes
to
leeward
then
caught
the
note
lowering
it
to
the
tenderest
sob
and
how
the
hurrying
gust
then
plunged
into
the
south
to
be
heard
no
more
the
sky
was
the
twinkling
of
all
the
stars
seemed
to
be
but
throbs
of
one
body
timed
by
a
common
pulse
the
north
star
was
directly
in
the
eye
and
since
evening
the
bear
had
swung
round
it
outwardly
to
the
east
till
he
was
now
at
a
right
angle
with
the
meridian
a
difference
of
colour
in
the
read
of
than
seen
in
really
perceptible
here
the
sovereign
brilliancy
of
sirius
pierced
the
eye
with
a
steely
glitter
the
star
called
capella
was
yellow
aldebaran
and
betelgueux
shone
with
a
fiery
red
to
persons
standing
alone
on
a
hill
during
a
clear
midnight
such
as
this
the
roll
of
the
world
eastward
is
almost
a
palpable
movement
the
sensation
may
be
caused
by
the
panoramic
glide
of
the
stars
past
earthly
objects
which
is
perceptible
in
a
few
minutes
of
stillness
or
by
the
better
outlook
upon
space
that
a
hill
affords
or
by
the
wind
or
by
the
solitude
but
whatever
be
its
origin
the
impression
of
riding
along
is
vivid
and
abiding
the
poetry
of
motion
is
a
phrase
much
in
use
and
to
enjoy
the
epic
form
of
that
gratification
it
is
necessary
to
stand
on
a
hill
at
a
small
hour
of
the
night
and
having
first
expanded
with
a
sense
of
difference
from
the
mass
of
civilised
mankind
who
are
dreamwrapt
and
disregardful
of
all
such
proceedings
at
this
time
long
and
quietly
watch
your
stately
progress
through
the
stars
after
such
a
nocturnal
reconnoitre
it
is
hard
to
get
back
to
earth
and
to
believe
that
the
consciousness
of
such
majestic
speeding
is
derived
from
a
tiny
human
frame
suddenly
an
unexpected
series
of
sounds
began
to
be
heard
in
this
place
up
against
the
sky
they
had
a
clearness
which
was
to
be
found
nowhere
in
the
wind
and
a
sequence
which
was
to
be
found
nowhere
in
nature
they
were
the
notes
of
farmer
flute
the
tune
was
not
floating
unhindered
into
the
open
air
it
seemed
muffled
in
some
way
and
was
altogether
too
curtailed
in
power
to
spread
high
or
wide
it
came
from
the
direction
of
a
small
dark
object
under
the
plantation
presenting
an
outline
to
which
an
uninitiated
person
might
have
been
puzzled
to
attach
either
meaning
or
use
the
image
as
a
whole
was
that
of
a
small
ark
on
a
small
ararat
allowing
the
traditionary
outlines
and
general
form
of
the
ark
which
are
followed
by
by
these
means
are
established
in
imaginations
among
their
firmest
because
earliest
pass
as
an
approximate
pattern
the
hut
stood
on
little
wheels
which
raised
its
floor
about
a
foot
from
the
ground
such
huts
are
dragged
into
the
fields
when
the
lambing
season
comes
on
to
shelter
the
shepherd
in
his
enforced
nightly
attendance
it
was
only
latterly
that
people
had
begun
to
call
gabriel
oak
during
the
twelvemonth
preceding
this
time
he
had
been
enabled
by
sustained
efforts
of
industry
and
chronic
good
spirits
to
lease
the
small
of
which
norcombe
hill
was
a
portion
and
stock
it
with
two
hundred
sheep
previously
he
had
been
a
bailiff
for
a
short
time
and
earlier
still
a
shepherd
only
having
from
his
childhood
assisted
his
father
in
tending
the
flocks
of
large
proprietors
till
old
gabriel
sank
to
rest
this
venture
unaided
and
alone
into
the
paths
of
farming
as
master
and
not
as
man
with
an
advance
of
sheep
not
yet
paid
for
was
a
critical
juncture
with
gabriel
oak
and
he
recognised
his
position
clearly
the
first
movement
in
his
new
progress
was
the
lambing
of
his
ewes
and
sheep
having
been
his
speciality
from
his
youth
he
wisely
refrained
from
deputing
the
task
of
tending
them
at
this
season
to
a
hireling
or
a
novice
the
wind
continued
to
beat
about
the
corners
of
the
hut
but
the
ceased
a
rectangular
space
of
light
appeared
in
the
side
of
the
hut
and
in
the
opening
the
outline
of
farmer
figure
he
carried
a
lantern
in
his
hand
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
came
forward
and
busied
himself
about
this
nook
of
the
field
for
nearly
twenty
minutes
the
lantern
light
appearing
and
disappearing
here
and
there
and
brightening
him
or
darkening
him
as
he
stood
before
or
behind
it
motions
though
they
had
a
quiet
energy
were
slow
and
their
deliberateness
accorded
well
with
his
occupation
fitness
being
the
basis
of
beauty
nobody
could
have
denied
that
his
steady
swings
and
turns
in
and
about
the
flock
had
elements
of
grace
yet
although
if
occasion
demanded
he
could
do
or
think
a
thing
with
as
mercurial
a
dash
as
can
the
men
of
towns
who
are
more
to
the
manner
born
his
special
power
morally
physically
and
mentally
was
static
owing
little
or
nothing
to
momentum
as
a
rule
a
close
examination
of
the
ground
hereabout
even
by
the
wan
starlight
only
revealed
how
a
portion
of
what
would
have
been
casually
called
a
wild
slope
had
been
appropriated
by
farmer
oak
for
his
great
purpose
this
winter
detached
hurdles
thatched
with
straw
were
stuck
into
the
ground
at
various
scattered
points
amid
and
under
which
the
whitish
forms
of
his
meek
ewes
moved
and
rustled
the
ring
of
the
which
had
been
silent
during
his
absence
recommenced
in
tones
that
had
more
mellowness
than
clearness
owing
to
an
increasing
growth
of
surrounding
wool
this
continued
till
oak
withdrew
again
from
the
flock
he
returned
to
the
hut
bringing
in
his
arms
a
lamb
consisting
of
four
legs
large
enough
for
a
sheep
united
by
a
seemingly
inconsiderable
membrane
about
half
the
substance
of
the
legs
collectively
which
constituted
the
entire
body
just
at
present
the
little
speck
of
life
he
placed
on
a
wisp
of
hay
before
the
small
stove
where
a
can
of
milk
was
simmering
oak
extinguished
the
lantern
by
blowing
into
it
and
then
pinching
the
snuff
the
cot
being
lighted
by
a
candle
suspended
by
a
twisted
wire
a
rather
hard
couch
formed
of
a
few
corn
sacks
thrown
carelessly
down
covered
half
the
floor
of
this
little
habitation
and
here
the
young
man
stretched
himself
along
loosened
his
woollen
cravat
and
closed
his
eyes
in
about
the
time
a
person
unaccustomed
to
bodily
labour
would
have
decided
upon
which
side
to
lie
farmer
oak
was
asleep
the
inside
of
the
hut
as
it
now
presented
itself
was
cosy
and
alluring
and
the
scarlet
handful
of
fire
in
addition
to
the
candle
reflecting
its
own
genial
colour
upon
whatever
it
could
reach
flung
associations
of
enjoyment
even
over
utensils
and
tools
in
the
corner
stood
the
and
along
a
shelf
at
one
side
were
ranged
bottles
and
canisters
of
the
simple
preparations
pertaining
to
ovine
surgery
and
physic
spirits
of
wine
turpentine
tar
magnesia
ginger
and
being
the
chief
on
a
triangular
shelf
across
the
corner
stood
bread
bacon
cheese
and
a
cup
for
ale
or
cider
which
was
supplied
from
a
flagon
beneath
beside
the
provisions
lay
the
flute
whose
notes
had
lately
been
called
forth
by
the
lonely
watcher
to
beguile
a
tedious
hour
the
house
was
ventilated
by
two
round
holes
like
the
lights
of
a
cabin
with
wood
slides
the
lamb
revived
by
the
warmth
began
to
bleat
and
the
sound
entered
ears
and
brain
with
an
instant
meaning
as
expected
sounds
will
passing
from
the
profoundest
sleep
to
the
most
alert
wakefulness
with
the
same
ease
that
had
accompanied
the
reverse
operation
he
looked
at
his
watch
found
that
the
had
shifted
again
put
on
his
hat
took
the
lamb
in
his
arms
and
carried
it
into
the
darkness
after
placing
the
little
creature
with
its
mother
he
stood
and
carefully
examined
the
sky
to
ascertain
the
time
of
night
from
the
altitudes
of
the
stars
the
and
aldebaran
pointing
to
the
restless
pleiades
were
up
the
southern
sky
and
between
them
hung
orion
which
gorgeous
constellation
never
burnt
more
vividly
than
now
as
it
soared
forth
above
the
rim
of
the
landscape
castor
and
pollux
with
their
quiet
shine
were
almost
on
the
meridian
the
barren
and
gloomy
square
of
pegasus
was
creeping
round
to
the
far
away
through
the
plantation
vega
sparkled
like
a
lamp
suspended
amid
the
leafless
trees
and
chair
stood
daintily
poised
on
the
uppermost
boughs
said
gabriel
being
a
man
not
without
a
frequent
consciousness
that
there
was
some
charm
in
this
life
he
led
he
stood
still
after
looking
at
the
sky
as
a
useful
instrument
and
regarded
it
in
an
appreciative
spirit
as
a
work
of
art
superlatively
beautiful
for
a
moment
he
seemed
impressed
with
the
speaking
loneliness
of
the
scene
or
rather
with
the
complete
abstraction
from
all
its
compass
of
the
sights
and
sounds
of
man
human
shapes
interferences
troubles
and
joys
were
all
as
if
they
were
not
and
there
seemed
to
be
on
the
shaded
hemisphere
of
the
globe
no
sentient
being
save
himself
he
could
fancy
them
all
gone
round
to
the
sunny
side
occupied
thus
with
eyes
stretched
afar
oak
gradually
perceived
that
what
he
had
previously
taken
to
be
a
star
low
down
behind
the
outskirts
of
the
plantation
was
in
reality
no
such
thing
it
was
an
artificial
light
almost
close
at
hand
to
find
themselves
utterly
alone
at
night
where
company
is
desirable
and
expected
makes
some
people
fearful
but
a
case
more
trying
by
far
to
the
nerves
is
to
discover
some
mysterious
companionship
when
intuition
sensation
memory
analogy
testimony
probability
kind
of
evidence
in
the
united
to
persuade
consciousness
that
it
is
quite
in
isolation
farmer
oak
went
towards
the
plantation
and
pushed
through
its
lower
boughs
to
the
windy
side
a
dim
mass
under
the
slope
reminded
him
that
a
shed
occupied
a
place
here
the
site
being
a
cutting
into
the
slope
of
the
hill
so
that
at
its
back
part
the
roof
was
almost
level
with
the
ground
in
front
it
was
formed
of
board
nailed
to
posts
and
covered
with
tar
as
a
preservative
through
crevices
in
the
roof
and
side
spread
streaks
and
dots
of
light
a
combination
of
which
made
the
radiance
that
had
attracted
him
oak
stepped
up
behind
where
leaning
down
upon
the
roof
and
putting
his
eye
close
to
a
hole
he
could
see
into
the
interior
clearly
the
place
contained
two
women
and
two
cows
by
the
side
of
the
latter
a
steaming
stood
in
a
bucket
one
of
the
women
was
past
middle
age
her
companion
was
apparently
young
and
graceful
he
could
form
no
decided
opinion
upon
her
looks
her
position
being
almost
beneath
his
eye
so
that
he
saw
her
in
a
view
as
satan
first
saw
paradise
she
wore
no
bonnet
or
hat
but
had
enveloped
herself
in
a
large
cloak
which
was
carelessly
flung
over
her
head
as
a
covering
now
go
home
said
the
elder
of
the
two
resting
her
knuckles
upon
her
hips
and
looking
at
their
as
a
whole
do
hope
daisy
will
fetch
round
again
now
i
have
never
been
more
frightened
in
my
life
but
i
mind
breaking
my
rest
if
she
the
young
woman
whose
eyelids
were
apparently
inclined
to
fall
together
on
the
smallest
provocation
of
silence
yawned
without
parting
her
lips
to
any
inconvenient
extent
whereupon
gabriel
caught
the
infection
and
slightly
yawned
in
sympathy
wish
we
were
rich
enough
to
pay
a
man
to
do
these
things
she
said
we
are
not
we
must
do
them
ourselves
said
the
other
you
must
help
me
if
you
my
hat
is
gone
however
continued
the
younger
went
over
the
hedge
i
think
the
idea
of
such
a
slight
wind
catching
the
cow
standing
erect
was
of
the
devon
breed
and
was
encased
in
a
tight
warm
hide
of
rich
indian
red
as
absolutely
uniform
from
eyes
to
tail
as
if
the
animal
had
been
dipped
in
a
dye
of
that
colour
her
long
back
being
mathematically
level
the
other
was
spotted
grey
and
white
beside
her
oak
now
noticed
a
little
calf
about
a
day
old
looking
idiotically
at
the
two
women
which
showed
that
it
had
not
long
been
accustomed
to
the
phenomenon
of

no

oak
upon
hearing
these
remarks
became
more
curious
to
observe
her
features
but
this
prospect
being
denied
him
by
the
hooding
effect
of
the
cloak
and
by
his
aërial
position
he
felt
himself
drawing
upon
his
fancy
for
their
details
in
making
even
horizontal
and
clear
inspections
we
colour
and
mould
according
to
the
wants
within
us
whatever
our
eyes
bring
in
had
gabriel
been
able
from
the
first
to
get
a
distinct
view
of
her
countenance
his
estimate
of
it
as
very
handsome
or
slightly
so
would
have
been
as
his
soul
required
a
divinity
at
the
moment
or
was
ready
supplied
with
one
having
for
some
time
known
the
want
of
a
satisfactory
form
to
fill
an
increasing
void
within
him
his
position
moreover
affording
the
widest
scope
for
his
fancy
he
painted
her
a
beauty
by
one
of
those
whimsical
coincidences
in
which
nature
like
a
busy
mother
seems
to
spare
a
moment
from
her
unremitting
labours
to
turn
and
make
her
children
smile
the
girl
now
dropped
the
cloak
and
forth
tumbled
ropes
of
black
hair
over
a
red
jacket
oak
knew
her
instantly
as
the
heroine
of
the
yellow
waggon
myrtles
and
prosily
as
the
woman
who
owed
him
twopence
they
placed
the
calf
beside
its
mother
again
took
up
the
lantern
and
went
out

down
the

it
was
no
more
than
a
nebula

returned
to
his

chapter
iii
a
girl
on
the
sluggish
day
began
to
break
even
its
position
terrestrially
is
one
of
the
elements
of
a
new
interest
and
for
no
particular
reason
save
that
the
incident
of
the
night
had
occurred
there
oak
went
again
into
the
plantation
lingering
and
musing
here
he
heard
the
steps
of
a
horse
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
soon
there
appeared
in
view
an
auburn
pony
with
a
girl
on
its
back
ascending
by
the
path
leading
past
the
she
was
the
young
woman
of
the
night
before
gabriel
instantly
thought
of
the
hat
she
had
mentioned
as
having
lost
in
the
wind
possibly
she
had
come
to
look
for
it
he
hastily
scanned
the
ditch
and
after
walking
about
ten
yards
along
it
found
the
hat
among
the
leaves
gabriel
took
it
in
his
hand
and
returned
to
his
hut
here
he
ensconced
himself
and
peeped
through
the
loophole
in
the
direction
of
the
approach
she
came
up
and
looked
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
gabriel
was
about
to
advance
and
restore
the
missing
article
when
an
unexpected
performance
induced
him
to
suspend
the
action
for
the
present
the
path
after
passing
the
cowshed
bisected
the
plantation
it
was
not
a
a
track
and
the
boughs
spread
horizontally
at
a
height
not
greater
than
seven
feet
above
the
ground
which
made
it
impossible
to
ride
erect
beneath
them
the
girl
who
wore
no
looked
around
for
a
moment
as
if
to
assure
herself
that
all
humanity
was
out
of
view
then
dexterously
dropped
backwards
flat
upon
the
back
her
head
over
its
tail
her
feet
against
its
shoulders
and
her
eyes
to
the
sky
the
rapidity
of
her
glide
into
this
position
was
that
of
a
noiselessness
that
of
a
hawk
eyes
had
scarcely
been
able
to
follow
her
the
tall
lank
pony
seemed
used
to
such
doings
and
ambled
along
unconcerned
thus
she
passed
under
the
level
boughs
the
performer
seemed
quite
at
home
anywhere
between
a
head
and
its
tail
and
the
necessity
for
this
abnormal
attitude
having
ceased
with
the
passage
of
the
plantation
she
began
to
adopt
another
even
more
obviously
convenient
than
the
first
she
had
no
and
it
was
very
apparent
that
a
firm
seat
upon
the
smooth
leather
beneath
her
was
unattainable
sideways
springing
to
her
accustomed
perpendicular
like
a
bowed
sapling
and
satisfying
herself
that
nobody
was
in
sight
she
seated
herself
in
the
manner
demanded
by
the
saddle
though
hardly
expected
of
the
woman
and
trotted
off
in
the
direction
of
tewnell
mill
oak
was
amused
perhaps
a
little
astonished
and
hanging
up
the
hat
in
his
hut
went
again
among
his
ewes
an
hour
passed
the
girl
returned
properly
seated
now
with
a
bag
of
bran
in
front
of
her
on
nearing
the
she
was
met
by
a
boy
bringing
a
who
held
the
reins
of
the
pony
whilst
she
slid
off
the
boy
led
away
the
horse
leaving
the
pail
with
the
young
woman
soon
soft
spirts
alternating
with
loud
spirts
came
in
regular
succession
from
within
the
shed
the
obvious
sounds
of
a
person
milking
a
cow
gabriel
took
the
lost
hat
in
his
hand
and
waited
beside
the
path
she
would
follow
in
leaving
the
hill
she
came
the
pail
in
one
hand
hanging
against
her
knee
the
left
arm
was
extended
as
a
balance
enough
of
it
being
shown
bare
to
make
oak
wish
that
the
event
had
happened
in
the
summer
when
the
whole
would
have
been
revealed
there
was
a
bright
air
and
manner
about
her
now
by
which
she
seemed
to
imply
that
the
desirability
of
her
existence
could
not
be
questioned
and
this
rather
saucy
assumption
failed
in
being
offensive
because
a
beholder
felt
it
to
be
upon
the
whole
true
like
exceptional
emphasis
in
the
tone
of
a
genius
that
which
would
have
made
mediocrity
ridiculous
was
an
addition
to
recognised
power
it
was
with
some
surprise
that
she
saw
face
rising
like
the
moon
behind
the
hedge
the
adjustment
of
the
hazy
conceptions
of
her
charms
to
the
portrait
of
herself
she
now
presented
him
with
was
less
a
diminution
than
a
difference
the
selected
by
the
judgment
was
her
height
she
seemed
tall
but
the
pail
was
a
small
one
and
the
hedge
diminutive
hence
making
allowance
for
error
by
comparison
with
these
she
could
have
been
not
above
the
height
to
be
chosen
by
women
as
best
all
features
of
consequence
were
severe
and
regular
it
may
have
been
observed
by
persons
who
go
about
the
shires
with
eyes
for
beauty
that
in
englishwoman
a
face
is
seldom
found
to
be
united
with
a
figure
of
the
same
pattern
the
features
being
generally
too
large
for
the
remainder
of
the
frame
that
a
graceful
and
proportionate
figure
of
eight
heads
usually
goes
off
into
random
facial
curves
without
throwing
a
nymphean
tissue
over
a
milkmaid
let
it
be
said
that
here
criticism
checked
itself
as
out
of
place
and
looked
at
her
proportions
with
a
long
consciousness
of
pleasure
from
the
contours
of
her
figure
in
its
upper
part
she
must
have
had
a
beautiful
neck
and
shoulders
but
since
her
infancy
nobody
had
ever
seen
them
had
she
been
put
into
a
low
dress
she
would
have
run
and
thrust
her
head
into
a
bush
yet
she
was
not
a
shy
girl
by
any
means
it
was
merely
her
instinct
to
draw
the
line
dividing
the
seen
from
the
unseen
higher
than
they
do
it
in
towns
that
the
thoughts
hovered
about
her
face
and
form
as
soon
as
she
caught
eyes
conning
the
same
page
was
natural
and
almost
certain
the
shown
would
have
been
vanity
if
a
little
more
pronounced
dignity
if
a
little
less
rays
of
male
vision
seem
to
have
a
tickling
effect
upon
virgin
faces
in
rural
districts
she
brushed
hers
with
her
hand
as
if
gabriel
had
been
irritating
its
pink
surface
by
actual
touch
and
the
free
air
of
her
previous
movements
was
reduced
at
the
same
time
to
a
chastened
phase
of
itself
yet
it
was
the
man
who
blushed
the
maid
not
at
all
found
a
hat
said
oak
is
mine
said
she
and
from
a
sense
of
proportion
kept
down
to
a
small
smile
an
inclination
to
laugh
distinctly
flew
away
last
this
morning
she
was
surprised
did
you
know
she
said
was
are
farmer
oak
are
you
not
or
thereabouts
lately
come
to
this
large
farm
she
inquired
casting
her
eyes
round
and
swinging
back
her
hair
which
was
black
in
the
shaded
hollows
of
its
mass
but
it
being
now
an
hour
past
sunrise
the
rays
touched
its
prominent
curves
with
a
colour
of
their
own
not
large
about
a
in
speaking
of
farms
the
word
is
omitted
by
the
natives
by
analogy
to
such
old
expressions
as
stag
of
wanted
my
hat
this
morning
she
went
on
had
to
ride
to
tewnell
you
do
you
know
saw
she
inquired
a
misgiving
bringing
every
muscle
of
her
lineaments
and
frame
to
a
standstill
through
the
plantation
and
all
down
the
hill
said
farmer
oak
with
an
aspect
excessively
knowing
with
regard
to
some
matter
in
his
mind
as
he
gazed
at
a
remote
point
in
the
direction
named
and
then
turned
back
to
meet
his
eyes
a
perception
caused
him
to
withdraw
his
own
eyes
from
hers
as
suddenly
as
if
he
had
been
caught
in
a
theft
recollection
of
the
strange
antics
she
had
indulged
in
when
passing
through
the
trees
was
succeeded
in
the
girl
by
a
nettled
palpitation
and
that
by
a
hot
face
it
was
a
time
to
see
a
woman
redden
who
was
not
given
to
reddening
as
a
rule
not
a
point
in
the
milkmaid
but
was
of
the
deepest
from
the
blush
through
all
varieties
of
the
provence
down
to
the
crimson
tuscany
the
countenance
of
acquaintance
quickly
graduated
whereupon
he
in
considerateness
turned
away
his
head
the
sympathetic
man
still
looked
the
other
way
and
wondered
when
she
would
recover
coolness
sufficient
to
justify
him
in
facing
her
again
he
heard
what
seemed
to
be
the
flitting
of
a
dead
leaf
upon
the
breeze
and
looked
she
had
gone
away
with
an
air
between
that
of
tragedy
and
comedy
gabriel
returned
to
his
work
five
mornings
and
evenings
passed
the
young
woman
came
regularly
to
milk
the
healthy
cow
or
to
attend
to
the
sick
one
but
never
allowed
her
vision
to
stray
in
the
direction
of
person
his
want
of
tact
had
deeply
offended
by
seeing
what
he
could
not
help
but
by
letting
her
know
that
he
had
seen
it
for
as
without
law
there
is
no
sin
without
eyes
there
is
no
indecorum
and
she
appeared
to
feel
that
espial
had
made
her
an
indecorous
woman
without
her
own
connivance
it
was
food
for
great
regret
with
him
it
was
also
a
which
touched
into
life
a
latent
heat
he
had
experienced
in
that
direction
the
acquaintanceship
might
however
have
ended
in
a
slow
forgetting
but
for
an
incident
which
occurred
at
the
end
of
the
same
week
one
afternoon
it
began
to
freeze
and
the
frost
increased
with
evening
which
drew
on
like
a
stealthy
tightening
of
bonds
it
was
a
time
when
in
cottages
the
breath
of
the
sleepers
freezes
to
the
sheets
when
round
the
fire
of
a
mansion
the
backs
are
cold
even
whilst
their
faces
are
all
aglow
many
a
small
bird
went
to
bed
supperless
that
night
among
the
bare
boughs
as
the
drew
near
oak
kept
his
usual
watch
upon
the
cowshed
at
last
he
felt
cold
and
shaking
an
extra
quantity
of
bedding
round
the
yearling
ewes
he
entered
the
hut
and
heaped
more
fuel
upon
the
stove
the
wind
came
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
and
to
prevent
it
oak
laid
a
sack
there
and
wheeled
the
cot
round
a
little
more
to
the
south
then
the
wind
spouted
in
at
a
ventilating
which
there
was
one
on
each
side
of
the
hut
gabriel
had
always
known
that
when
the
fire
was
lighted
and
the
door
closed
one
of
these
must
be
kept
chosen
being
always
on
the
side
away
from
the
wind
closing
the
slide
to
windward
he
turned
to
open
the
other
on
second
thoughts
the
farmer
considered
that
he
would
first
sit
down
leaving
both
closed
for
a
minute
or
two
till
the
temperature
of
the
hut
was
a
little
raised
he
sat
down
his
head
began
to
ache
in
an
unwonted
manner
and
fancying
himself
weary
by
reason
of
the
broken
rests
of
the
preceding
nights
oak
decided
to
get
up
open
the
slide
and
then
allow
himself
to
fall
asleep
he
fell
asleep
however
without
having
performed
the
necessary
preliminary
how
long
he
remained
unconscious
gabriel
never
knew
during
the
first
stages
of
his
return
to
perception
peculiar
deeds
seemed
to
be
in
course
of
enactment
his
dog
was
howling
his
head
was
aching
was
pulling
him
about
hands
were
loosening
his
neckerchief
on
opening
his
eyes
he
found
that
evening
had
sunk
to
dusk
in
a
strange
manner
of
unexpectedness
the
young
girl
with
the
remarkably
pleasant
lips
and
white
teeth
was
beside
him
more
than
head
was
upon
her
lap
his
face
and
neck
were
disagreeably
wet
and
her
fingers
were
unbuttoning
his
collar
is
the
matter
said
oak
vacantly
she
seemed
to
experience
mirth
but
of
too
insignificant
a
kind
to
start
enjoyment
now
she
answered
you
are
not
dead
it
is
a
wonder
you
were
not
suffocated
in
this
hut
of
the
hut
murmured
gabriel
gave
ten
pounds
for
that
hut
but
sell
it
and
sit
under
thatched
hurdles
as
they
did
in
old
times
and
curl
up
to
sleep
in
a
lock
of
straw
it
played
me
nearly
the
same
trick
the
other
day
gabriel
by
way
of
emphasis
brought
down
his
fist
upon
the
floor
was
not
exactly
the
fault
of
the
hut
she
observed
in
a
tone
which
showed
her
to
be
that
novelty
among
who
finished
a
thought
before
beginning
the
sentence
which
was
to
convey
it
should
i
think
have
considered
and
not
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
leave
the
slides
i
suppose
i
should
said
oak
absently
he
was
endeavouring
to
catch
and
appreciate
the
sensation
of
being
thus
with
her
his
head
upon
her
dress
before
the
event
passed
on
into
the
heap
of
bygone
things
he
wished
she
knew
his
impressions
but
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
carrying
an
odour
in
a
net
as
of
attempting
to
convey
the
intangibilities
of
his
feeling
in
the
coarse
meshes
of
language
so
he
remained
silent
she
made
him
sit
up
and
then
oak
began
wiping
his
face
and
shaking
himself
like
a
samson
can
i
thank
he
said
at
last
gratefully
some
of
the
natural
rusty
red
having
returned
to
his
face
never
mind
that
said
the
girl
smiling
and
allowing
her
smile
to
hold
good
for
next
remark
whatever
that
might
prove
to
be
did
you
find
me
heard
your
dog
howling
and
scratching
at
the
door
of
the
hut
when
i
came
to
the
milking
it
was
so
lucky
milking
is
almost
over
for
the
season
and
i
shall
not
come
here
after
this
week
or
the
next
the
dog
saw
me
and
jumped
over
to
me
and
laid
hold
of
my
skirt
i
came
across
and
looked
round
the
hut
the
very
first
thing
to
see
if
the
slides
were
closed
my
uncle
has
a
hut
like
this
one
and
i
have
heard
him
tell
his
shepherd
not
to
go
to
sleep
without
leaving
a
slide
open
i
opened
the
door
and
there
you
were
like
dead
i
threw
the
milk
over
you
as
there
was
no
water
forgetting
it
was
warm
and
no
wonder
if
i
should
have
died
gabriel
said
in
a
low
voice
which
was
rather
meant
to
travel
back
to
himself
than
to
her
no
the
girl
replied
she
seemed
to
prefer
a
less
tragic
probability
to
have
saved
a
man
from
death
involved
talk
that
should
harmonise
with
the
dignity
of
such
a
she
shunned
it
believe
you
saved
my
life
know
your
name
i
know
your
but
not
would
just
as
soon
not
tell
not
there
is
no
reason
either
why
i
should
as
you
probably
will
never
have
much
to
do
with
i
should
like
to
can
inquire
at
my
will
tell
name
is
gabriel
mine
you
seem
fond
of
yours
in
speaking
it
so
decisively
gabriel
see
it
is
the
only
one
i
shall
ever
have
and
i
must
make
the
most
of
always
think
mine
sounds
odd
and
should
think
you
might
soon
get
a
new
many
opinions
you
keep
about
you
concerning
other
people
gabriel
the
thought
you
would
like
them
but
i
match
you
i
know
in
mapping
out
my
mind
upon
my
tongue
i
never
was
very
clever
in
my
inside
but
i
thank
you
come
give
me
your
she
hesitated
somewhat
disconcerted
at
earnest
conclusion
to
a
dialogue
lightly
carried
on
well
she
said
and
gave
him
her
hand
compressing
her
lips
to
a
demure
impassivity
he
held
it
but
an
instant
and
in
his
fear
of
being
too
demonstrative
swerved
to
the
opposite
extreme
touching
her
fingers
with
the
lightness
of
a
person
am
sorry
he
said
the
instant
after
for
your
hand
go
so
may
have
it
again
if
you
like
there
it
she
gave
him
her
hand
again
oak
held
it
longer
this
curiously
long
soft
it
winter
time
chapped
or
rough
or
anything
he
said
long
enough
said
she
though
without
pulling
it
away
i
suppose
you
are
thinking
you
would
like
to
kiss
it
you
may
if
you
want
thinking
of
any
such
thing
said
gabriel
simply
i
you
she
snatched
back
her
hand
gabriel
felt
himself
guilty
of
another
want
of
tact

out
my
name

teasingly
and
withdrew
chapter
iv
mistake
the
only
superiority
in
women
that
is
tolerable
to
the
rival
sex
is
as
a
rule
that
of
the
unconscious
kind
but
a
superiority
which
recognizes
itself
may
sometimes
please
by
suggesting
possibilities
of
capture
to
the
subordinated
man
this
and
comely
girl
soon
made
appreciable
inroads
upon
the
emotional
constitution
of
young
farmer
oak
love
being
an
extremely
exacting
usurer
a
sense
of
exorbitant
profit
spiritually
by
an
exchange
of
hearts
being
at
the
bottom
of
pure
passions
as
that
of
exorbitant
profit
bodily
or
materially
is
at
the
bottom
of
those
of
lower
atmosphere
every
morning
feelings
were
as
sensitive
as
the
in
calculations
upon
his
chances
his
dog
waited
for
his
meals
in
a
way
so
like
that
in
which
oak
waited
for
the
presence
that
the
farmer
was
quite
struck
with
the
resemblance
felt
it
lowering
and
would
not
look
at
the
dog
however
he
continued
to
watch
through
the
hedge
for
her
regular
coming
and
thus
his
sentiments
towards
her
were
deepened
without
any
corresponding
effect
being
produced
upon
herself
oak
had
nothing
finished
and
ready
to
say
as
yet
and
not
being
able
to
frame
love
phrases
which
end
where
they
begin
passionate
of
sound
and
fury
he
said
no
word
at
all
by
making
inquiries
he
found
that
the
name
was
bathsheba
everdene
and
that
the
cow
would
go
dry
in
about
seven
days
he
dreaded
the
eighth
day
at
last
the
eighth
day
came
the
cow
had
ceased
to
give
milk
for
that
year
and
bathsheba
everdene
came
up
the
hill
no
more
gabriel
had
reached
a
pitch
of
existence
he
never
could
have
anticipated
a
short
time
before
he
liked
saying
as
a
private
enjoyment
instead
of
whistling
turned
over
his
taste
to
black
hair
though
he
had
sworn
by
brown
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
isolated
himself
till
the
space
he
filled
in
the
public
eye
was
contemptibly
small
love
is
a
possible
strength
in
an
actual
weakness
marriage
transforms
a
distraction
into
a
support
the
power
of
which
should
be
and
happily
often
is
in
direct
proportion
to
the
degree
of
imbecility
it
supplants
oak
began
now
to
see
light
in
this
direction
and
said
to
himself
make
her
my
wife
or
upon
my
soul
i
shall
be
good
for
nothing
all
this
while
he
was
perplexing
himself
about
an
errand
on
which
he
might
consistently
visit
the
cottage
of
aunt
he
found
his
opportunity
in
the
death
of
a
ewe
mother
of
a
living
lamb
on
a
day
which
had
a
summer
face
and
a
winter
fine
january
morning
when
there
was
just
enough
blue
sky
visible
to
make
people
wish
for
more
and
an
occasional
gleam
of
silvery
sunshine
oak
put
the
lamb
into
a
respectable
sunday
basket
and
stalked
across
the
fields
to
the
house
of
hurst
the
the
dog
walking
behind
with
a
countenance
of
great
concern
at
the
serious
turn
pastoral
affairs
seemed
to
be
taking
gabriel
had
watched
the
blue
curling
from
the
chimney
with
strange
meditation
at
evening
he
had
fancifully
traced
it
down
the
chimney
to
the
spot
of
its
the
hearth
and
bathsheba
beside
it
in
her
dress
for
the
clothes
she
had
worn
on
the
hill
were
by
association
equally
with
her
person
included
in
the
compass
of
his
affection
they
seemed
at
this
early
time
of
his
love
a
necessary
ingredient
of
the
sweet
mixture
called
bathsheba
everdene
he
had
made
a
toilet
of
a
a
nature
between
the
carefully
neat
and
the
carelessly
a
degree
between
and
selection
he
thoroughly
cleaned
his
silver
with
whiting
put
new
lacing
straps
to
his
boots
looked
to
the
brass
went
to
the
inmost
heart
of
the
plantation
for
a
new
and
trimmed
it
vigorously
on
his
way
back
took
a
new
handkerchief
from
the
bottom
of
his
put
on
the
light
waistcoat
patterned
all
over
with
sprigs
of
an
elegant
flower
uniting
the
beauties
of
both
rose
and
lily
without
the
defects
of
either
and
used
all
the
he
possessed
upon
his
usually
dry
sandy
and
inextricably
curly
hair
till
he
had
deepened
it
to
a
splendidly
novel
colour
between
that
of
guano
and
roman
cement
making
it
stick
to
his
head
like
mace
round
a
nutmeg
or
wet
seaweed
round
a
boulder
after
the
ebb
nothing
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
cottage
save
the
chatter
of
a
knot
of
sparrows
on
the
eaves
one
might
fancy
scandal
and
rumour
to
be
no
less
the
staple
topic
of
these
little
coteries
on
roofs
than
of
those
under
them
it
seemed
that
the
omen
was
an
unpropitious
one
for
as
the
rather
untoward
commencement
of
overtures
just
as
he
arrived
by
the
garden
gate
he
saw
a
cat
inside
going
into
various
arched
shapes
and
fiendish
convulsions
at
the
sight
of
his
dog
george
the
dog
took
no
notice
for
he
had
arrived
at
an
age
at
which
all
superfluous
barking
was
cynically
avoided
as
a
waste
of
fact
he
never
barked
even
at
the
sheep
except
to
order
when
it
was
done
with
an
absolutely
neutral
countenance
as
a
sort
of
which
though
offensive
had
to
be
gone
through
once
now
and
then
to
frighten
the
flock
for
their
own
good
a
voice
came
from
behind
some
into
which
the
cat
had
run
dear
did
a
nasty
brute
of
a
dog
want
to
kill
it
he
poor
dear
beg
your
pardon
said
oak
to
the
voice
george
was
walking
on
behind
me
with
a
temper
as
mild
as
almost
before
he
had
ceased
speaking
oak
was
seized
with
a
misgiving
as
to
whose
ear
was
the
recipient
of
his
answer
nobody
appeared
and
he
heard
the
person
retreat
among
the
bushes
gabriel
meditated
and
so
deeply
that
he
brought
small
furrows
into
his
forehead
by
sheer
force
of
reverie
where
the
issue
of
an
interview
is
as
likely
to
be
a
vast
change
for
the
worse
as
for
the
better
any
initial
difference
from
expectation
causes
nipping
sensations
of
failure
oak
went
up
to
the
door
a
little
abashed
his
mental
rehearsal
and
the
reality
had
had
no
common
grounds
of
opening
aunt
was
indoors
you
tell
miss
everdene
that
somebody
would
be
glad
to
speak
to
her
said
oak
calling
self
merely
somebody
without
giving
a
name
is
not
to
be
taken
as
an
example
of
the
of
the
rural
world
it
springs
from
a
refined
modesty
of
which
townspeople
with
their
cards
and
announcements
have
no
notion
whatever
bathsheba
was
out
the
voice
had
evidently
been
hers
you
come
in
oak
thank
said
gabriel
following
her
to
the
fireplace
brought
a
lamb
for
miss
everdene
i
thought
she
might
like
one
to
rear
girls
might
said
hurst
musingly
only
a
visitor
here
if
you
will
wait
a
minute
bathsheba
will
be
i
will
wait
said
gabriel
sitting
down
lamb
really
the
business
i
came
about
hurst
in
short
i
was
going
to
ask
her
if
like
to
be
were
you
indeed
because
if
she
would
i
should
be
very
glad
to
marry
her
know
if
got
any
other
young
man
hanging
about
her
at
all
me
think
said
hurst
poking
the
fire
superfluously
you
ever
so
many
young
men
you
see
farmer
oak
so
and
an
excellent
scholar
was
going
to
be
a
governess
once
you
know
only
she
was
too
wild
not
that
her
young
men
ever
come
lord
in
the
nature
of
women
she
must
have
a
dozen
unfortunate
said
farmer
oak
contemplating
a
crack
in
the
stone
floor
with
sorrow
only
an
sort
of
man
and
my
only
chance
was
in
being
the
first
comer
well
no
use
in
my
waiting
for
that
was
all
i
came
about
so
take
myself
off
when
gabriel
had
gone
about
two
hundred
yards
along
the
down
he
heard
a
uttered
behind
him
in
a
piping
note
of
more
treble
quality
than
that
in
which
the
exclamation
usually
embodies
itself
when
shouted
across
a
field
he
looked
round
and
saw
a
girl
racing
after
him
waving
a
white
handkerchief
oak
stood
the
runner
drew
nearer
it
was
bathsheba
everdene
colour
deepened
hers
was
already
deep
not
as
it
appeared
from
emotion
but
from
running
she
said
pausing
for
want
of
breath
pulling
up
in
front
of
him
with
a
slanted
face
and
putting
her
hand
to
her
side
have
just
called
to
see
you
said
gabriel
pending
her
further
speech
know
that
she
said
panting
like
a
robin
her
face
red
and
moist
from
her
exertions
like
a
peony
petal
before
the
sun
dries
off
the
dew
know
you
had
come
to
ask
to
have
me
or
i
should
have
come
in
from
the
garden
instantly
i
ran
after
you
to
my
aunt
made
a
mistake
in
sending
you
away
from
courting
gabriel
expanded
sorry
to
have
made
you
run
so
fast
my
dear
he
said
with
a
grateful
sense
of
favours
to
come
a
bit
till
found
your
was
quite
a
telling
you
i
had
a
young
man
already
bathsheba
went
on
a
sweetheart
at
i
never
had
one
and
i
thought
that
as
times
go
with
women
it
was
a
pity
to
send
you
away
thinking
that
i
had
and
truly
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
said
farmer
oak
smiling
one
of
his
long
special
smiles
and
blushing
with
gladness
he
held
out
his
hand
to
take
hers
which
when
she
had
eased
her
side
by
pressing
it
there
was
prettily
extended
upon
her
bosom
to
still
her
heart
directly
he
seized
it
she
put
it
behind
her
so
that
it
slipped
through
his
fingers
like
an
eel
have
a
nice
snug
little
farm
said
gabriel
with
half
a
degree
less
assurance
than
when
he
had
seized
her
hand
you
man
has
advanced
me
money
to
begin
with
but
still
it
will
soon
be
paid
off
and
though
i
am
only
an
sort
of
man
i
have
got
on
a
little
since
i
was
a
gabriel
uttered
in
a
tone
to
show
her
that
it
was
the
complacent
form
of
great
he
continued
we
be
married
i
am
quite
sure
i
can
work
twice
as
hard
as
i
do
he
went
forward
and
stretched
out
his
arm
again
bathsheba
had
overtaken
him
at
a
point
beside
which
stood
a
low
stunted
holly
bush
now
laden
with
red
berries
seeing
his
advance
take
the
form
of
an
attitude
threatening
a
possible
enclosure
if
not
compression
of
her
person
she
edged
off
round
the
bush
farmer
oak
she
said
over
the
top
looking
at
him
with
rounded
eyes
never
said
i
was
going
to
marry
a
tale
said
oak
with
dismay
run
after
anybody
like
this
and
then
say
you
want
him
i
meant
to
tell
you
was
only
this
she
said
eagerly
and
yet
half
conscious
of
the
absurdity
of
the
position
she
had
made
for
nobody
has
got
me
yet
as
a
sweetheart
instead
of
my
having
a
dozen
as
my
aunt
said
i
to
be
thought
property
in
that
way
though
possibly
i
shall
be
had
some
day
why
if
wanted
you
i
have
run
after
you
like
this
have
been
the
thing
but
there
was
no
harm
in
hurrying
to
correct
a
piece
of
false
news
that
had
been
told
harm
at
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
being
too
generous
in
expressing
a
judgment
impulsively
and
oak
added
with
a
more
appreciative
sense
of
all
the
i
am
not
quite
certain
it
was
no
i
time
to
think
before
starting
whether
i
wanted
to
marry
or
not
for
have
been
gone
over
the
said
gabriel
freshening
again
a
minute
or
two
wait
a
while
miss
everdene
will
you
marry
me
do
bathsheba
i
love
you
far
more
than
common
try
to
think
she
observed
rather
more
timorously
i
can
think
out
of
doors
my
mind
spreads
away
you
can
give
a
give
me
bathsheba
looked
thoughtfully
into
the
distance
away
from
the
direction
in
which
gabriel
stood
can
make
you
happy
said
he
to
the
back
of
her
head
across
the
bush
shall
have
a
piano
in
a
year
or
wives
are
getting
to
have
pianos
practise
up
the
flute
right
well
to
play
with
you
in
the
i
should
like
have
one
of
those
little
gigs
for
nice
flowers
and
and
hens
i
mean
because
they
be
useful
continued
gabriel
feeling
balanced
between
poetry
and
practicality
should
like
it
very
a
frame
for
a
gentleman
and
when
the
wedding
was
over
have
it
put
in
the
newspaper
list
of
i
should
like
that
the
babies
in
the
man
jack
of
and
at
home
by
the
fire
whenever
you
look
up
there
i
shall
whenever
i
look
up
there
will
be
wait
and
be
improper
her
countenance
fell
and
she
was
silent
awhile
he
regarded
the
red
berries
between
them
over
and
over
again
to
such
an
extent
that
holly
seemed
in
his
after
life
to
be
a
cypher
signifying
a
proposal
of
marriage
bathsheba
decisively
turned
to
him
no
use
she
said
want
to
marry
have
tried
hard
all
the
time
been
thinking
for
a
marriage
would
be
very
nice
in
one
sense
people
would
talk
about
me
and
think
i
had
won
my
battle
and
i
should
feel
triumphant
and
all
that
but
a
always
be
there
as
you
say
whenever
i
looked
up
there
course
he
that
what
i
mean
is
that
i
mind
being
a
bride
at
a
wedding
if
i
could
be
one
without
having
a
husband
but
since
a
woman
show
off
in
that
way
by
herself
i
least
a
terrible
wooden
story
at
this
criticism
of
her
statement
bathsheba
made
an
addition
to
her
dignity
by
a
slight
sweep
away
from
him
my
heart
and
soul
i
know
what
a
maid
can
say
stupider
than
that
said
oak
dearest
he
continued
in
a
palliative
voice
be
like
it
oak
sighed
a
deep
honest
the
less
so
in
that
being
like
the
sigh
of
a
pine
plantation
it
was
rather
noticeable
as
a
disturbance
of
the
atmosphere
you
have
me
he
appealed
creeping
round
the
holly
to
reach
her
side
can
not
she
said
retreating
why
he
persisted
standing
still
at
last
in
despair
of
ever
reaching
her
and
facing
over
the
bush
i
love
she
contracted
a
yawn
to
an
inoffensive
smallness
so
that
it
was
hardly
at
all
love
you
she
said
i
love
as
for
myself
i
am
content
to
be
very
fine
get
to
despise
said
mr
oak
so
earnestly
that
he
seemed
to
be
coming
by
the
force
of
his
words
straight
through
the
bush
and
into
her
arms
shall
do
one
thing
in
this
thing
is
love
you
and
long
for
you
and
wanting
till
i
his
voice
had
a
genuine
pathos
now
and
his
large
brown
hands
perceptibly
trembled
seems
dreadfully
wrong
not
to
have
you
when
you
feel
so
much
she
said
with
a
little
distress
and
looking
hopelessly
around
for
some
means
of
escape
from
her
moral
dilemma
i
wish
i
run
after
you
however
she
seemed
to
have
a
short
cut
for
getting
back
to
cheerfulness
and
set
her
face
to
signify
archness
do
oak
i
want
somebody
to
tame
me
i
am
too
independent
and
you
would
never
be
able
to
i
oak
cast
his
eyes
down
the
field
in
a
way
implying
that
it
was
useless
to
attempt
argument
oak
she
said
with
luminous
distinctness
and
common
sense
are
better
off
than
i
have
hardly
a
penny
in
the
am
staying
with
my
aunt
for
my
bare
sustenance
i
am
better
educated
than
i
love
you
a
bit
my
side
of
the
case
now
yours
you
are
a
farmer
just
beginning
and
you
ought
in
common
prudence
if
you
marry
at
all
which
you
should
certainly
not
think
of
doing
at
present
to
marry
a
woman
with
money
who
would
stock
a
larger
farm
for
you
than
you
have
gabriel
looked
at
her
with
a
little
surprise
and
much
admiration
the
very
thing
i
had
been
thinking
myself
he
naïvely
said
farmer
oak
had
christian
characteristics
too
many
to
succeed
with
bathsheba
his
humility
and
a
superfluous
moiety
of
honesty
bathsheba
was
decidedly
disconcerted
then
why
did
you
come
and
disturb
me
she
said
almost
angrily
if
not
quite
an
enlarging
red
spot
rising
in
each
cheek
do
what
i
think
would
have
made
an
admission
oak
she
exclaimed
with
even
more
hauteur
and
rocking
her
head
disdainfully
that
do
you
think
i
could
marry
you
not
if
i
know
he
broke
in
passionately
mistake
me
like
that
because
i
am
open
enough
to
own
what
every
man
in
my
shoes
would
have
thought
of
you
make
your
colours
come
up
your
face
and
get
crabbed
with
me
that
about
your
not
being
good
enough
for
me
is
nonsense
you
speak
like
a
the
parish
notice
it
and
your
uncle
at
weatherbury
is
i
have
heerd
a
large
larger
than
ever
i
shall
be
may
i
call
in
the
evening
or
will
you
walk
along
with
me
sundays
i
want
you
to
your
mind
at
once
if
rather
can
not
press
me
any
i
love
be
ridiculous
she
said
with
a
laugh
no
man
likes
to
see
his
emotions
the
sport
of
a
of
skittishness
well
said
oak
firmly
with
the
bearing
of
one
who
was
going
to
give
his
days
and
nights
to
ecclesiastes
for
ever
ask
you
no
chapter
v
departure
of
pastoral
tragedy
the
news
which
one
day
reached
gabriel
that
bathsheba
everdene
had
left
the
neighbourhood
had
an
influence
upon
him
which
might
have
surprised
any
who
never
suspected
that
the
more
emphatic
the
renunciation
the
less
absolute
its
character
it
may
have
been
observed
that
there
is
no
regular
path
for
getting
out
of
love
as
there
is
for
getting
in
some
people
look
upon
marriage
as
a
short
cut
that
way
but
it
has
been
known
to
fail
separation
which
was
the
means
that
chance
offered
to
gabriel
oak
by
disappearance
though
effectual
with
people
of
certain
humours
is
apt
to
idealize
the
removed
object
with
those
whose
affection
placid
and
regular
as
it
may
be
flows
deep
and
long
oak
belonged
to
the
order
of
humanity
and
felt
the
secret
fusion
of
himself
in
bathsheba
to
be
burning
with
a
finer
flame
now
that
she
was
was
all
his
incipient
friendship
with
her
aunt
had
been
nipped
by
the
failure
of
his
suit
and
all
that
oak
learnt
of
movements
was
done
indirectly
it
appeared
that
she
had
gone
to
a
place
called
weatherbury
more
than
twenty
miles
off
but
in
what
as
a
visitor
or
permanently
he
could
not
discover
gabriel
had
two
dogs
george
the
elder
exhibited
an
nose
surrounded
by
a
narrow
margin
of
pink
flesh
and
a
coat
marked
in
random
splotches
approximating
in
colour
to
white
and
slaty
grey
but
the
grey
after
years
of
sun
and
rain
had
been
scorched
and
washed
out
of
the
more
prominent
locks
leaving
them
of
a
as
if
the
blue
component
of
the
grey
had
faded
like
the
indigo
from
the
same
kind
of
colour
in
pictures
in
substance
it
had
originally
been
hair
but
long
contact
with
sheep
seemed
to
be
turning
it
by
degrees
into
wool
of
a
poor
quality
and
staple
this
dog
had
originally
belonged
to
a
shepherd
of
inferior
morals
and
dreadful
temper
and
the
result
was
that
george
knew
the
exact
degrees
of
condemnation
signified
by
cursing
and
swearing
of
all
descriptions
better
than
the
wickedest
old
man
in
the
neighbourhood
long
experience
had
so
precisely
taught
the
animal
the
difference
between
such
exclamations
as
in
and
ye
come
in
that
he
knew
to
a
breadth
the
rate
of
trotting
back
from
the
tails
that
each
call
involved
if
a
staggerer
with
the
sheep
crook
was
to
be
escaped
though
old
he
was
clever
and
trustworthy
still
the
young
dog
son
might
possibly
have
been
the
image
of
his
mother
for
there
was
not
much
resemblance
between
him
and
george
he
was
learning
the
business
so
as
to
follow
on
at
the
flock
when
the
other
should
die
but
had
got
no
further
than
the
rudiments
as
finding
an
insuperable
difficulty
in
distinguishing
between
doing
a
thing
well
enough
and
doing
it
too
well
so
earnest
and
yet
so
was
this
young
dog
he
had
no
name
in
particular
and
answered
with
perfect
readiness
to
any
pleasant
interjection
that
if
sent
behind
the
flock
to
help
them
on
he
did
it
so
thoroughly
that
he
would
have
chased
them
across
the
whole
county
with
the
greatest
pleasure
if
not
called
off
or
reminded
when
to
stop
by
the
example
of
old
george
thus
much
for
the
dogs
on
the
further
side
of
norcombe
hill
was
a
from
which
chalk
had
been
drawn
for
generations
and
spread
over
adjacent
farms
two
hedges
converged
upon
it
in
the
form
of
a
v
but
without
quite
meeting
the
narrow
opening
left
which
was
immediately
over
the
brow
of
the
pit
was
protected
by
a
rough
railing
one
night
when
farmer
oak
had
returned
to
his
house
believing
there
would
be
no
further
necessity
for
his
attendance
on
the
down
he
called
as
usual
to
the
dogs
previously
to
shutting
them
up
in
the
outhouse
till
next
morning
only
one
george
the
other
could
not
be
found
either
in
the
house
lane
or
garden
gabriel
then
remembered
that
he
had
left
the
two
dogs
on
the
hill
eating
a
dead
lamb
a
kind
of
meat
he
usually
kept
from
them
except
when
other
food
ran
short
and
concluding
that
the
young
one
had
not
finished
his
meal
he
went
indoors
to
the
luxury
of
a
bed
which
latterly
he
had
only
enjoyed
on
sundays
it
was
a
still
moist
night
just
before
dawn
he
was
assisted
in
waking
by
the
abnormal
reverberation
of
familiar
music
to
the
shepherd
the
note
of
the
like
the
ticking
of
the
clock
to
other
people
is
a
chronic
sound
that
only
makes
itself
noticed
by
ceasing
or
altering
in
some
unusual
manner
from
the
idle
twinkle
which
signifies
to
the
accustomed
ear
however
distant
that
all
is
well
in
the
fold
in
the
solemn
calm
of
the
awakening
morn
that
note
was
heard
by
gabriel
beating
with
unusual
violence
and
rapidity
this
exceptional
ringing
may
be
caused
in
two
the
rapid
feeding
of
the
sheep
bearing
the
bell
as
when
the
flock
breaks
into
new
pasture
which
gives
it
an
intermittent
rapidity
or
by
the
sheep
starting
off
in
a
run
when
the
sound
has
a
regular
palpitation
the
experienced
ear
of
oak
knew
the
sound
he
now
heard
to
be
caused
by
the
running
of
the
flock
with
great
velocity
he
jumped
out
of
bed
dressed
tore
down
the
lane
through
a
foggy
dawn
and
ascended
the
hill
the
forward
ewes
were
kept
apart
from
those
among
which
the
fall
of
lambs
would
be
later
there
being
two
hundred
of
the
latter
class
in
flock
these
two
hundred
seemed
to
have
absolutely
vanished
from
the
hill
there
were
the
fifty
with
their
lambs
enclosed
at
the
other
end
as
he
had
left
them
but
the
rest
forming
the
bulk
of
the
flock
were
nowhere
gabriel
called
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
call
ovey
ovey
not
a
single
bleat
he
went
to
the
hedge
a
gap
had
been
broken
through
it
and
in
the
gap
were
the
footprints
of
the
sheep
rather
surprised
to
find
them
break
fence
at
this
season
yet
putting
it
down
instantly
to
their
great
fondness
for
ivy
in
of
which
a
great
deal
grew
in
the
plantation
he
followed
through
the
hedge
they
were
not
in
the
plantation
he
called
again
the
valleys
and
farthest
hills
resounded
as
when
the
sailors
invoked
the
lost
hylas
on
the
mysian
shore
but
no
sheep
he
passed
through
the
trees
and
along
the
ridge
of
the
hill
on
the
extreme
summit
where
the
ends
of
the
two
converging
hedges
of
which
we
have
spoken
were
stopped
short
by
meeting
the
brow
of
the
he
saw
the
younger
dog
standing
against
the
and
motionless
as
napoleon
at
helena
a
horrible
conviction
darted
through
oak
with
a
sensation
of
bodily
faintness
he
advanced
at
one
point
the
rails
were
broken
through
and
there
he
saw
the
footprints
of
his
ewes
the
dog
came
up
licked
his
hand
and
made
signs
implying
that
he
expected
some
great
reward
for
signal
services
rendered
oak
looked
over
the
precipice
the
ewes
lay
dead
and
dying
at
its
heap
of
two
hundred
mangled
carcasses
representing
in
their
condition
just
now
at
least
two
hundred
more
oak
was
an
intensely
humane
man
indeed
his
humanity
often
tore
in
pieces
any
politic
intentions
of
his
which
bordered
on
strategy
and
carried
him
on
as
by
gravitation
a
shadow
in
his
life
had
always
been
that
his
flock
ended
in
a
day
came
and
found
every
shepherd
an
arrant
traitor
to
his
defenseless
sheep
his
first
feeling
now
was
one
of
pity
for
the
untimely
fate
of
these
gentle
ewes
and
their
unborn
lambs
it
was
a
second
to
remember
another
phase
of
the
matter
the
sheep
were
not
insured
all
the
savings
of
a
frugal
life
had
been
dispersed
at
a
blow
his
hopes
of
being
an
independent
farmer
were
laid
for
ever
energies
patience
and
industry
had
been
so
severely
taxed
during
the
years
of
his
life
between
eighteen
and
to
reach
his
present
stage
of
progress
that
no
more
seemed
to
be
left
in
him
he
leant
down
upon
a
rail
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
stupors
however
do
not
last
for
ever
and
farmer
oak
recovered
from
his
it
was
as
remarkable
as
it
was
characteristic
that
the
one
sentence
he
uttered
was
in
thankfulness
god
i
am
not
married
what
would
have
done
in
the
poverty
now
coming
upon
me
oak
raised
his
head
and
wondering
what
he
could
do
listlessly
surveyed
the
scene
by
the
outer
margin
of
the
pit
was
an
oval
pond
and
over
it
hung
the
attenuated
skeleton
of
a
moon
which
had
only
a
few
days
to
morning
star
dogging
her
on
the
left
hand
the
pool
glittered
like
a
dead
eye
and
as
the
world
awoke
a
breeze
blew
shaking
and
elongating
the
reflection
of
the
moon
without
breaking
it
and
turning
the
image
of
the
star
to
a
phosphoric
streak
upon
the
water
all
this
oak
saw
and
remembered
as
far
as
could
be
learnt
it
appeared
that
the
poor
young
dog
still
under
the
impression
that
since
he
was
kept
for
running
after
sheep
the
more
he
ran
after
them
the
better
had
at
the
end
of
his
meal
off
the
dead
lamb
which
may
have
given
him
additional
energy
and
spirits
collected
all
the
ewes
into
a
corner
driven
the
timid
creatures
through
the
hedge
across
the
upper
field
and
by
main
force
of
worrying
had
given
them
momentum
enough
to
break
down
a
portion
of
the
rotten
railing
and
so
hurled
them
over
the
edge
son
had
done
his
work
so
thoroughly
that
he
was
considered
too
good
a
workman
to
live
and
was
in
fact
taken
and
tragically
shot
at

that
same
instance
of
the
untoward
fate
which
so
often
attends
dogs
and
other
philosophers
who
follow
out
a
train
of
reasoning
to
its
logical
conclusion
and
attempt
perfectly
consistent
conduct
in

up
so
largely
of

cleared
off

found
that
the
value
of
stock
plant
and
implements
which
were
really
his
own
would
be
about
sufficient
to
pay
his
debts

himself
a
free
man
with
the
clothes
he
stood
up
in
and
nothing
more
chapter
vi
the
fire
two
months
passed
away
we
are
brought
on
to
a
day
in
february
on
which
was
held
the
yearly
statute
or
hiring
fair
in
the
of
casterbridge
at
one
end
of
the
street
stood
from
two
to
three
hundred
blithe
and
hearty
labourers
waiting
upon
men
of
the
stamp
to
whom
labour
suggests
nothing
worse
than
a
wrestle
with
gravitation
and
pleasure
nothing
better
than
a
renunciation
of
the
same
among
these
carters
and
waggoners
were
distinguished
by
having
a
piece
of
twisted
round
their
hats
thatchers
wore
a
fragment
of
woven
straw
shepherds
held
their
in
their
hands
and
thus
the
situation
required
was
known
to
the
hirers
at
a
glance
in
the
crowd
was
an
athletic
young
fellow
of
somewhat
superior
appearance
to
the
fact
his
superiority
was
marked
enough
to
lead
several
ruddy
peasants
standing
by
to
speak
to
him
inquiringly
as
to
a
farmer
and
to
use
as
a
finishing
word
his
answer
always
was
am
looking
for
a
place
do
ye
know
of
anybody
who
wants
one
gabriel
was
paler
now
his
eyes
were
more
meditative
and
his
expression
was
more
sad
he
had
passed
through
an
ordeal
of
wretchedness
which
had
given
him
more
than
it
had
taken
away
he
had
sunk
from
his
modest
elevation
as
pastoral
king
into
the
very
of
siddim
but
there
was
left
to
him
a
dignified
calm
he
had
never
before
known
and
that
indifference
to
fate
which
though
it
often
makes
a
villain
of
a
man
is
the
basis
of
his
sublimity
when
it
does
not
and
thus
the
abasement
had
been
exaltation
and
the
loss
gain
in
the
morning
a
regiment
of
cavalry
had
left
the
town
and
a
sergeant
and
his
party
had
been
beating
up
for
recruits
through
the
four
streets
as
the
end
of
the
day
drew
on
and
he
found
himself
not
hired
gabriel
almost
wished
that
he
had
joined
them
and
gone
off
to
serve
his
country
weary
of
standing
in
the
and
not
much
minding
the
kind
of
work
he
turned
his
hand
to
he
decided
to
offer
himself
in
some
other
capacity
than
that
of
bailiff
all
the
farmers
seemed
to
be
wanting
shepherds
was
speciality
turning
down
an
obscure
street
and
entering
an
obscurer
lane
he
went
up
to
a
shop
long
would
it
take
you
to
make
a
crook
much
he
sat
on
a
bench
and
the
crook
was
made
a
stem
being
given
him
into
the
bargain
he
then
went
to
a
shop
the
owner
of
which
had
a
large
rural
connection
as
the
crook
had
absorbed
most
of
money
he
attempted
and
carried
out
an
exchange
of
his
overcoat
for
a
regulation
this
transaction
having
been
completed
he
again
hurried
off
to
the
centre
of
the
town
and
stood
on
the
kerb
of
the
pavement
as
a
shepherd
crook
in
hand
now
that
oak
had
turned
himself
into
a
shepherd
it
seemed
that
bailiffs
were
most
in
demand
however
two
or
three
farmers
noticed
him
and
drew
near
dialogues
followed
more
or
less
in
the
subjoined
form
do
you
come
from
a
long
way
farm
were
you
upon
last
this
reply
invariably
operated
like
a
rumour
of
cholera
the
inquiring
farmer
would
edge
away
and
shake
his
head
dubiously
gabriel
like
his
dog
was
too
good
to
be
trustworthy
and
he
never
made
advance
beyond
this
point
it
is
safer
to
accept
any
chance
that
offers
itself
and
extemporize
a
procedure
to
fit
it
than
to
get
a
good
plan
matured
and
wait
for
a
chance
of
using
it
gabriel
wished
he
had
not
nailed
up
his
colours
as
a
shepherd
but
had
laid
himself
out
for
anything
in
the
whole
cycle
of
labour
that
was
required
in
the
fair
it
grew
dusk
some
merry
men
were
whistling
and
singing
by
the
hand
which
had
lain
for
some
time
idle
in
his
pocket
touched
his
flute
which
he
carried
there
here
was
an
opportunity
for
putting
his
dearly
bought
wisdom
into
practice
he
drew
out
his
flute
and
began
to
play
to
the
in
the
style
of
a
man
who
had
never
known
a
sorrow
oak
could
pipe
with
arcadian
sweetness
and
the
sound
of
the
notes
cheered
his
own
heart
as
well
as
those
of
the
loungers
he
played
on
with
spirit
and
in
half
an
hour
had
earned
in
pence
what
was
a
small
fortune
to
a
destitute
man
by
making
inquiries
he
learnt
that
there
was
another
fair
at
shottsford
the
next
day
far
is
shottsford
miles
side
of
weatherbury
it
was
where
bathsheba
had
gone
two
months
before
this
information
was
like
coming
from
night
into
noon
far
is
it
to
weatherbury
or
six
bathsheba
had
probably
left
weatherbury
long
before
this
time
but
the
place
had
enough
interest
attaching
to
it
to
lead
oak
to
choose
shottsford
fair
as
his
next
field
of
inquiry
because
it
lay
in
the
weatherbury
quarter
moreover
the
weatherbury
folk
were
by
no
means
uninteresting
intrinsically
if
report
spoke
truly
they
were
as
hardy
merry
thriving
wicked
a
set
as
any
in
the
whole
county
oak
resolved
to
sleep
at
weatherbury
that
night
on
his
way
to
shottsford
and
struck
out
at
once
into
the
high
road
which
had
been
recommended
as
the
direct
route
to
the
village
in
question
the
road
stretched
through
traversed
by
little
brooks
whose
quivering
surfaces
were
braided
along
their
centres
and
folded
into
creases
at
the
sides
or
where
the
flow
was
more
rapid
the
stream
was
pied
with
spots
of
white
froth
which
rode
on
in
undisturbed
serenity
on
the
higher
levels
the
dead
and
dry
carcasses
of
leaves
tapped
the
ground
as
they
bowled
along
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
wind
and
little
birds
in
the
hedges
were
rustling
their
feathers
and
tucking
themselves
in
comfortably
for
the
night
retaining
their
places
if
oak
kept
moving
but
flying
away
if
he
stopped
to
look
at
them
he
passed
by
yalbury
wood
where
the
were
rising
to
their
roosts
and
heard
the
cuck
and
the
wheezy
whistle
of
the
hens
by
the
time
he
had
walked
three
or
four
miles
every
shape
in
the
landscape
had
assumed
a
uniform
hue
of
blackness
he
descended
yalbury
hill
and
could
just
discern
ahead
of
him
a
waggon
drawn
up
under
a
great
tree
by
the
roadside
on
coming
close
he
found
there
were
no
horses
attached
to
it
the
spot
being
apparently
quite
deserted
the
waggon
from
its
position
seemed
to
have
been
left
there
for
the
night
for
beyond
about
half
a
truss
of
hay
which
was
heaped
in
the
bottom
it
was
quite
empty
gabriel
sat
down
on
the
shafts
of
the
vehicle
and
considered
his
position
he
calculated
that
he
had
walked
a
very
fair
proportion
of
the
journey
and
having
been
on
foot
since
daybreak
he
felt
tempted
to
lie
down
upon
the
hay
in
the
waggon
instead
of
pushing
on
to
the
village
of
weatherbury
and
having
to
pay
for
a
lodging
eating
his
last
slices
of
bread
and
ham
and
drinking
from
the
bottle
of
cider
he
had
taken
the
precaution
to
bring
with
him
he
got
into
the
lonely
waggon
here
he
spread
half
of
the
hay
as
a
bed
and
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
darkness
pulled
the
other
half
over
him
by
way
of
covering
himself
entirely
and
feeling
physically
as
comfortable
as
ever
he
had
been
in
his
life
inward
melancholy
it
was
impossible
for
a
man
like
oak
introspective
far
beyond
his
neighbours
to
banish
quite
whilst
conning
the
present
untoward
page
of
his
history
so
thinking
of
his
misfortunes
amorous
and
pastoral
he
fell
asleep
shepherds
enjoying
in
common
with
sailors
the
privilege
of
being
able
to
summon
the
god
instead
of
having
to
wait
for
him
on
somewhat
suddenly
awaking
after
a
sleep
of
whose
length
he
had
no
idea
oak
found
that
the
waggon
was
in
motion
he
was
being
carried
along
the
road
at
a
rate
rather
considerable
for
a
vehicle
without
springs
and
under
circumstances
of
physical
uneasiness
his
head
being
dandled
up
and
down
on
the
bed
of
the
waggon
like
a
he
then
distinguished
voices
in
conversation
coming
from
the
forpart
of
the
waggon
his
concern
at
this
dilemma
which
would
have
been
alarm
had
he
been
a
thriving
man
but
misfortune
is
a
fine
opiate
to
personal
terror
led
him
to
peer
cautiously
from
the
hay
and
the
first
sight
he
beheld
was
the
stars
above
him
wain
was
getting
towards
a
right
angle
with
the
pole
star
and
gabriel
concluded
that
it
must
be
about
nine
other
words
that
he
had
slept
two
hours
this
small
astronomical
calculation
was
made
without
any
positive
effort
and
whilst
he
was
stealthily
turning
to
discover
if
possible
into
whose
hands
he
had
fallen
two
figures
were
dimly
visible
in
front
sitting
with
their
legs
outside
the
waggon
one
of
whom
was
driving
gabriel
soon
found
that
this
was
the
waggoner
and
it
appeared
they
had
come
from
casterbridge
fair
like
himself
a
conversation
was
in
progress
which
continued
thus
as
a
fine
handsome
body
as
looks
be
concerned
but
only
the
skin
of
the
woman
and
these
dandy
cattle
be
as
proud
as
a
lucifer
in
their
do
seem
billy
do
this
utterance
was
very
shaky
by
nature
and
more
so
by
circumstance
the
jolting
of
the
waggon
not
being
without
its
effect
upon
the
larynx
it
came
from
the
man
who
held
the
reins
a
very
vain
said
here
and
now
if
so
be
like
that
i
look
her
in
the
face
lord
no
not
such
a
shy
man
as
i
be
very
vain
said
that
every
night
at
going
to
bed
she
looks
in
the
glass
to
put
on
her
not
a
married
woman
oh
the
world
can
play
the
peanner
so
said
can
play
so
clever
that
can
make
a
psalm
tune
sound
as
well
as
the
merriest
loose
song
a
man
can
wish
tell
a
happy
time
for
us
and
i
feel
quite
a
new
man
and
how
do
she
pay
i
know
master
on
hearing
these
and
other
similar
remarks
a
wild
thought
flashed
into
mind
that
they
might
be
speaking
of
bathsheba
there
were
however
no
grounds
for
retaining
such
a
supposition
for
the
waggon
though
going
in
the
direction
of
weatherbury
might
be
going
beyond
it
and
the
woman
alluded
to
seemed
to
be
the
mistress
of
some
estate
they
were
now
apparently
close
upon
weatherbury
and
not
to
alarm
the
speakers
unnecessarily
gabriel
slipped
out
of
the
waggon
unseen
he
turned
to
an
opening
in
the
hedge
which
he
found
to
be
a
gate
and
mounting
thereon
he
sat
meditating
whether
to
seek
a
cheap
lodging
in
the
village
or
to
ensure
a
cheaper
one
by
lying
under
some
hay
or
the
crunching
jangle
of
the
waggon
died
upon
his
ear
he
was
about
to
walk
on
when
he
noticed
on
his
left
hand
an
unusual
about
half
a
mile
distant
oak
watched
it
and
the
glow
increased
something
was
on
fire
gabriel
again
mounted
the
gate
and
leaping
down
on
the
other
side
upon
what
he
found
to
be
ploughed
soil
made
across
the
field
in
the
exact
direction
of
the
fire
the
blaze
enlarging
in
a
double
ratio
by
his
approach
and
its
own
increase
showed
him
as
he
drew
nearer
the
outlines
of
ricks
beside
it
lighted
up
to
great
distinctness
a
was
the
source
of
the
fire
his
weary
face
now
began
to
be
painted
over
with
a
rich
orange
glow
and
the
whole
front
of
his
and
gaiters
was
covered
with
a
dancing
shadow
pattern
of
light
reaching
him
through
a
leafless
intervening
the
metallic
curve
of
his
shone
in
the
same
abounding
rays
he
came
up
to
the
boundary
fence
and
stood
to
regain
breath
it
seemed
as
if
the
spot
was
unoccupied
by
a
living
soul
the
fire
was
issuing
from
a
long
which
was
so
far
gone
as
to
preclude
a
possibility
of
saving
it
a
rick
burns
differently
from
a
house
as
the
wind
blows
the
fire
inwards
the
portion
in
flames
completely
disappears
like
melting
sugar
and
the
outline
is
lost
to
the
eye
however
a
hay
or
a
well
put
together
will
resist
combustion
for
a
length
of
time
if
it
begins
on
the
outside
this
before
eyes
was
a
rick
of
straw
loosely
put
together
and
the
flames
darted
into
it
with
lightning
swiftness
it
glowed
on
the
windward
side
rising
and
falling
in
intensity
like
the
coal
of
a
cigar
then
a
superincumbent
bundle
rolled
down
with
a
whisking
noise
flames
elongated
and
bent
themselves
about
with
a
quiet
roar
but
no
crackle
banks
of
smoke
went
off
horizontally
at
the
back
like
passing
clouds
and
behind
these
burned
hidden
pyres
illuminating
the
sheet
of
smoke
to
a
lustrous
yellow
uniformity
individual
straws
in
the
foreground
were
consumed
in
a
creeping
movement
of
ruddy
heat
as
if
they
were
knots
of
red
worms
and
above
shone
imaginary
fiery
faces
tongues
hanging
from
lips
glaring
eyes
and
other
impish
forms
from
which
at
intervals
sparks
flew
in
clusters
like
birds
from
a
nest
oak
suddenly
ceased
from
being
a
mere
spectator
by
discovering
the
case
to
be
more
serious
than
he
had
at
first
imagined
a
scroll
of
smoke
blew
aside
and
revealed
to
him
a
in
startling
juxtaposition
with
the
decaying
one
and
behind
this
a
series
of
others
composing
the
main
corn
produce
of
the
farm
so
that
instead
of
the
standing
as
he
had
imagined
comparatively
isolated
there
was
a
regular
connection
between
it
and
the
remaining
stacks
of
the
group
gabriel
leapt
over
the
hedge
and
saw
that
he
was
not
alone
the
first
man
he
came
to
was
running
about
in
a
great
hurry
as
if
his
thoughts
were
several
yards
in
advance
of
his
body
which
they
could
never
drag
on
fast
enough
fire
a
good
master
and
a
bad
servant
is
fire
fire
mane
a
bad
servant
and
a
good
master
oh
mark
and
you
billy
you
maryann
you
jan
coggan
and
matthew
there
other
figures
now
appeared
behind
this
shouting
man
and
among
the
smoke
and
gabriel
found
that
far
from
being
alone
he
was
in
a
great
shadows
danced
merrily
up
and
down
timed
by
the
jigging
of
the
flames
and
not
at
all
by
their
movements
the
to
that
class
of
society
which
casts
its
thoughts
into
the
form
of
feeling
and
its
feelings
into
the
form
of
to
work
with
a
remarkable
confusion
of
purpose
the
draught
under
the
cried
gabriel
to
those
nearest
to
him
the
corn
stood
on
stone
staddles
and
between
these
tongues
of
yellow
hue
from
the
burning
straw
licked
and
darted
playfully
if
the
fire
once
got
this
stack
all
would
be
lost
a
said
gabriel
a
was
brought
and
they
hung
it
like
a
curtain
across
the
channel
the
flames
immediately
ceased
to
go
under
the
bottom
of
the
and
stood
up
vertical
here
with
a
bucket
of
water
and
keep
the
cloth
said
gabriel
again
the
flames
now
driven
upwards
began
to
attack
the
angles
of
the
huge
roof
covering
the
ladder
cried
gabriel
ladder
was
against
the
and
is
burnt
to
a
cinder
said
a
form
in
the
smoke
oak
seized
the
cut
ends
of
the
sheaves
as
if
he
were
going
to
engage
in
the
operation
of
and
digging
in
his
feet
and
occasionally
sticking
in
the
stem
of
his
he
clambered
up
the
beetling
face
he
at
once
sat
astride
the
very
apex
and
began
with
his
crook
to
beat
off
the
fiery
fragments
which
had
lodged
thereon
shouting
to
the
others
to
get
him
a
bough
and
a
ladder
and
some
water
billy
of
the
men
who
had
been
on
the
this
time
had
found
a
ladder
which
mark
clark
ascended
holding
on
beside
oak
upon
the
thatch
the
smoke
at
this
corner
was
stifling
and
clark
a
nimble
fellow
having
been
handed
a
bucket
of
water
bathed
face
and
sprinkled
him
generally
whilst
gabriel
now
with
a
long
in
one
hand
in
addition
to
his
crook
in
the
other
kept
sweeping
the
stack
and
dislodging
all
fiery
particles
on
the
ground
the
groups
of
villagers
were
still
occupied
in
doing
all
they
could
to
keep
down
the
conflagration
which
was
not
much
they
were
all
tinged
orange
and
backed
up
by
shadows
of
varying
pattern
round
the
corner
of
the
largest
stack
out
of
the
direct
rays
of
the
fire
stood
a
pony
bearing
a
young
woman
on
its
back
by
her
side
was
another
woman
on
foot
these
two
seemed
to
keep
at
a
distance
from
the
fire
that
the
horse
might
not
become
restive
a
shepherd
said
the
woman
on
foot
is
see
how
his
crook
shines
as
he
beats
the
rick
with
it
and
his
is
burnt
in
two
holes
i
declare
a
fine
young
shepherd
he
is
too
shepherd
is
he
said
the
equestrian
in
a
clear
voice
know
any
of
the
others
know
at
asked
quite
a
stranger
they
the
young
woman
on
the
pony
rode
out
from
the
shade
and
looked
anxiously
around
you
think
the
barn
is
safe

said

the
barn
is
safe
jan
coggan
said
the
second
woman
passing
on
the
question
to
the
nearest
man
in
that
direction
i
think
so
if
this
rick
had
gone
the
barn
would
have
followed
that
bold
shepherd
up
there
that
have
done
the
most
sitting
on
the
top
rick
whizzing
his
great
long
arms
about
like
a
does
work
hard
said
the
young
woman
on
horseback
looking
up
at
gabriel
through
her
thick
woollen
veil
wish
he
was
shepherd
here
any
of

his
form
the

began
to
get
worsted
and
elevated

being
no
longer

of

he
made
as
if
to
descend
said
the
girl
on
horseback
to
him
as
he
comes
down
and
say
that
the
farmer
wishes
to
thank
him
for
the
great
service
he
has
maryann
stalked
off
towards
the
rick
and
met
oak
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
she
delivered
her
message
is
your
master
the
farmer
asked
gabriel
kindling
with
the
idea
of
getting
employment
that
seemed
to
strike
him
now
a
master
a
mistress
woman
farmer
and
a
rich
one

a
bystander
came
here
from
a
distance
took
on
her
farm

died
suddenly
used
to
measure
his
money
in
cups
they
say
now
that
business
in
every
bank
in
casterbridge
and
thinks
no
more
of
playing
sovereign
than
you
and
i
do
a
bit
in
the
world
she
back
there
upon
the
pony

maryann
her
face
up
in
that
black
cloth
with
holes
in

features
smudged
grimy

undiscoverable
from
the
smoke
and

dripping
with

the

of
his
charred
six
inches

stern
adversity
had
thrust
upon
him
up

he
lifted
his
hat
with
respect
and
not
without
gallantry
stepping
close
to
her
hanging
feet
he
said
in
a
hesitating
voice
you
happen
to
want
a
shepherd
she
lifted
the
wool
veil
tied
round
her
face
and
looked
all
astonishment
gabriel

his
darling

mechanically
repeated
in

abashed
and
sad
voice

chapter
vii
timid
girl
bathsheba
withdrew
into
the
shade
she
scarcely
knew
whether
most
to
be
amused
at
the
singularity
of
the
meeting
or
to
be
concerned
at
its
awkwardness
there
was
room
for
a
little
pity
also
for
a
very
little
exultation
the
former
at
his
position
the
latter
at
her
own
embarrassed
she
was
not
and
she
remembered
declaration
of
love
to
her
at
norcombe
only
to
think
she
had
nearly
forgotten
it
she
murmured
putting
on
an
air
of
dignity
and
turning
again
to
him
with
a
little
warmth
of
cheek
do
want
a
shepherd
the
very
man
said
one
of
the
villagers
quietly
conviction
breeds
conviction
that
is
said
a
second
decisively
man
truly
said
a
third
with
heartiness
all
there
said
number
four
fervidly
will
you
tell
him
to
speak
to
the
bailiff
said
bathsheba
all
was
practical
again
now
a
summer
eve
and
loneliness
would
have
been
necessary
to
give
the
meeting
its
proper
fulness
of
romance
the
bailiff
was
pointed
out
to
gabriel
who
checking
the
palpitation
within
his
breast
at
discovering
that
this
ashtoreth
of
strange
report
was
only
a
modification
of
venus
the
and
admired
retired
with
him
to
talk
over
the
necessary
preliminaries
of
hiring
the
fire
before
them
wasted
away
said
bathsheba
shall
take
a
little
refreshment
after
this
extra
work
will
you
come
to
the
house
could
knock
in
a
bit
and
a
drop
a
good
deal
freer
miss
if
so
be
send
it
to
malthouse
replied
the
spokesman
bathsheba
then
rode
off
into
the
darkness
and
the
men
straggled
on
to
the
village
in
twos
and
and
the
bailiff
being
left
by
the
rick
alone
now
said
the
bailiff
finally
is
settled
i
think
about
your
coming
and
i
am
going
to
ye
you
get
me
a
lodging
inquired
gabriel
i
indeed
he
said
moving
past
oak
as
a
christian
edges
past
an
when
he
does
not
mean
to
contribute
you
follow
on
the
road
till
you
come
to
malthouse
where
they
are
all
gone
to
have
their
snap
of
victuals
i
daresay
some
of
will
tell
you
of
a
place
to
ye
the
bailiff
who
showed
this
nervous
dread
of
loving
his
neighbour
as
himself
went
up
the
hill
and
oak
walked
on
to
the
village
still
astonished
at
the
reencounter
with
bathsheba
glad
of
his
nearness
to
her
and
perplexed
at
the
rapidity
with
which
the
unpractised
girl
of
norcombe
had
developed
into
the
supervising
and
cool
woman
here
but
some
women
only
require
an
emergency
to
make
them
fit
for
one
obliged
to
some
extent
to
forgo
dreaming
in
order
to
find
the
way
he
reached
the
churchyard
and
passed
round
it
under
the
wall
where
several
ancient
trees
grew
there
was
a
wide
margin
of
grass
along
here
and
footsteps
were
deadened
by
its
softness
even
at
this
indurating
period
of
the
year
when
abreast
of
a
trunk
which
appeared
to
be
the
oldest
of
the
old
he
became
aware
that
a
figure
was
standing
behind
it
gabriel
did
not
pause
in
his
walk
and
in
another
moment
he
accidentally
kicked
a
loose
stone
the
noise
was
enough
to
disturb
the
motionless
stranger
who
started
and
assumed
a
careless
position
it
was
a
slim
girl
rather
thinly
clad
to
you
said
gabriel
heartily
said
the
girl
to
gabriel
the
voice
was
unexpectedly
attractive
it
was
the
low
and
dulcet
note
suggestive
of
romance
common
in
descriptions
rare
in
experience
thank
you
to
tell
me
if
in
the
way
for
malthouse
gabriel
resumed
primarily
to
gain
the
information
indirectly
to
get
more
of
the
music
right
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
do
you
the
girl
hesitated
and
then
went
on
again
you
know
how
late
they
keep
open
the
head
inn
she
seemed
to
be
won
by
heartiness
as
gabriel
had
been
won
by
her
modulations
know
where
the
head
is
or
anything
about
it
do
you
think
of
going
there
the
woman
again
paused
there
was
no
necessity
for
any
continuance
of
speech
and
the
fact
that
she
did
add
more
seemed
to
proceed
from
an
unconscious
desire
to
show
unconcern
by
making
a
remark
which
is
noticeable
in
the
ingenuous
when
they
are
acting
by
stealth
are
not
a
weatherbury
man
she
said
timorously
am
not
i
am
the
new
a
you
seem
almost
a
farmer
by
your
a
shepherd
gabriel
repeated
in
a
dull
cadence
of
finality
his
thoughts
were
directed
to
the
past
his
eyes
to
the
feet
of
the
girl
and
for
the
first
time
he
saw
lying
there
a
bundle
of
some
sort
she
may
have
perceived
the
direction
of
his
face
for
she
said
coaxingly
say
anything
in
the
parish
about
having
seen
me
here
will
least
not
for
a
day
or
two
if
you
wish
me
not
to
said
oak
you
indeed
the
other
replied
am
rather
poor
and
i
want
people
to
know
anything
about
then
she
was
silent
and
shivered
ought
to
have
a
cloak
on
such
a
cold
night
gabriel
observed
would
advise
to
get
no
would
you
mind
going
on
and
leaving
me
i
thank
you
much
for
what
you
have
told
will
go
on
he
said
adding
hesitatingly
you
are
not
very
well
off
perhaps
you
would
accept
this
trifle
from
me
it
is
only
a
shilling
but
it
is
all
i
have
to
i
will
take
it
said
the
stranger
gratefully
she
extended
her
hand
gabriel
his
in
feeling
for
each
palm
in
the
gloom
before
the
money
could
be
passed
a
minute
incident
occurred
which
told
much
fingers
alighted
on
the
young
wrist
it
was
beating
with
a
throb
of
tragic
intensity
he
had
frequently
felt
the
same
quick
hard
beat
in
the
femoral
artery
of
his
lambs
when
overdriven
it
suggested
a
consumption
too
great
of
a
vitality
which
to
judge
from
her
figure
and
stature
was
already
too
little
is
the
matter
there
is
no
no
let
your
having
seen
me
be
a
secret
well
i
will
the
young
girl
remained
motionless
by
the
tree
and
gabriel
descended
into
the
village
of
weatherbury
or
lower
longpuddle
as
it
was
sometimes
called
he
fancied
that
he
had
felt
himself
in
the
penumbra
of
a
very
deep
sadness
when
touching
that
slight
and
fragile
creature
but
wisdom
lies
in
moderating
mere
impressions
and
gabriel
endeavoured
to
think
little
of
this
chapter
viii
the
malthouse
was
enclosed
by
an
old
wall
inwrapped
with
ivy
and
though
not
much
of
the
exterior
was
visible
at
this
hour
the
character
and
purposes
of
the
building
were
clearly
enough
shown
by
its
outline
upon
the
sky
from
the
walls
an
overhanging
thatched
roof
sloped
up
to
a
point
in
the
centre
upon
which
rose
a
small
wooden
lantern
fitted
with
on
all
the
four
sides
and
from
these
openings
a
mist
was
dimly
perceived
to
be
escaping
into
the
night
air
there
was
no
window
in
front
but
a
square
hole
in
the
door
was
glazed
with
a
single
pane
through
which
red
comfortable
rays
now
stretched
out
upon
the
ivied
wall
in
front
voices
were
to
be
heard
inside
hand
skimmed
the
surface
of
the
door
with
fingers
extended
to
an
pattern
till
he
found
a
leathern
strap
which
he
pulled
this
lifted
a
wooden
latch
and
the
door
swung
open
the
room
inside
was
lighted
only
by
the
ruddy
glow
from
the
kiln
mouth
which
shone
over
the
floor
with
the
streaming
horizontality
of
the
setting
sun
and
threw
upwards
the
shadows
of
all
facial
irregularities
in
those
assembled
around
the
floor
was
worn
into
a
path
from
the
doorway
to
the
kiln
and
into
undulations
everywhere
a
curved
settle
of
unplaned
oak
stretched
along
one
side
and
in
a
remote
corner
was
a
small
bed
and
bedstead
the
owner
and
frequent
occupier
of
which
was
the
maltster
this
aged
man
was
now
sitting
opposite
the
fire
his
frosty
white
hair
and
beard
overgrowing
his
gnarled
figure
like
the
grey
moss
and
lichen
upon
a
leafless
he
wore
breeches
and
the
shoes
called
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
nose
was
greeted
by
an
atmosphere
laden
with
the
sweet
smell
of
new
malt
the
conversation
which
seemed
to
have
been
concerning
the
origin
of
the
fire
immediately
ceased
and
every
one
ocularly
criticised
him
to
the
degree
expressed
by
contracting
the
flesh
of
their
foreheads
and
looking
at
him
with
narrowed
eyelids
as
if
he
had
been
a
light
too
strong
for
their
sight
several
exclaimed
meditatively
after
this
operation
had
been
completed
the
new
shepherd
thought
we
heard
a
hand
pawing
about
the
door
for
the
bobbin
but
sure
not
a
dead
leaf
blowed
across
said
another
in
shepherd
sure
ye
be
welcome
though
we
know
yer
oak
my
name
the
ancient
maltster
sitting
in
the
midst
turned
at
turning
being
as
the
turning
of
a
rusty
crane
never
gable
grandson
over
at
he
said
as
a
formula
expressive
of
surprise
which
nobody
was
supposed
for
a
moment
to
take
literally
father
and
my
grandfather
were
old
men
of
the
name
of
gabriel
said
the
shepherd
placidly
i
knowed
the
face
as
i
seed
him
on
the
rick
i
did
and
where
be
ye
trading
to
now
shepherd
thinking
of
biding
here
said
oak
yer
grandfather
for
years
and
years
continued
the
maltster
the
words
coming
forth
of
their
own
accord
as
if
the
momentum
previously
imparted
had
been
sufficient
did
you
yer
her
too
knowed
yer
father
when
he
was
a
child
why
my
boy
jacob
there
and
your
father
were
sworn
they
were
ye
jacob
sure
said
his
son
a
young
man
about
with
a
head
and
one
tooth
in
the
left
centre
of
his
upper
jaw
which
made
much
of
itself
by
standing
prominent
like
a
milestone
in
a
bank
joe
had
most
to
do
with
him
however
my
son
william
must
have
knowed
the
very
man
afore
ye
billy
afore
ye
left
norcombe
andrew
said
son
billy
a
child
of
forty
or
thereabouts
who
manifested
the
peculiarity
of
possessing
a
cheerful
soul
in
a
gloomy
body
and
whose
whiskers
were
assuming
a
chinchilla
shade
here
and
there
can
mind
andrew
said
oak
being
a
man
in
the
place
when
i
was
quite
a
other
day
i
and
my
youngest
daughter
liddy
were
over
at
my
christening
continued
billy
were
talking
about
this
very
family
and
only
last
purification
day
in
this
very
world
when
the
is
gied
away
to
the
poor
folk
you
know
shepherd
and
i
can
mind
the
day
because
they
all
had
to
traypse
up
to
the
this
very
shepherd
and
drink
gape
and
swaller
with
drap
of
sommit
but
not
of
much
account
said
the
maltster
removing
from
the
fire
his
eyes
which
were
and
bleared
by
gazing
into
it
for
so
many
years
up
the
jacob
see
if
warm
jacob
stooped
to
the
which
was
a
tall
mug
standing
in
the
ashes
cracked
and
charred
with
heat
it
was
rather
furred
with
extraneous
matter
about
the
outside
especially
in
the
crevices
of
the
handles
the
innermost
curves
of
which
may
not
have
seen
daylight
for
several
years
by
reason
of
this
encrustation
of
ashes
accidentally
wetted
with
cider
and
baked
hard
but
to
the
mind
of
any
sensible
drinker
the
cup
was
no
worse
for
that
being
incontestably
clean
on
the
inside
and
about
the
rim
it
may
be
observed
that
such
a
class
of
mug
is
called
a
in
weatherbury
and
its
vicinity
for
uncertain
reasons
probably
because
its
size
makes
any
given
toper
feel
ashamed
of
himself
when
he
sees
its
bottom
in
drinking
it
empty
jacob
on
receiving
the
order
to
see
if
the
liquor
was
warm
enough
placidly
dipped
his
forefinger
into
it
by
way
of
thermometer
and
having
pronounced
it
nearly
of
the
proper
degree
raised
the
cup
and
very
civilly
attempted
to
dust
some
of
the
ashes
from
the
bottom
with
the
skirt
of
his
because

said
the
maltster
commandingly
at
all
said
gabriel
in
a
reproving
tone
of
considerateness
never
fuss
about
dirt
in
its
pure
state
and
when
i
know
what
sort
it
taking
the
mug
he
drank
an
inch
or
more
from
the
depth
of
its
contents
and
duly
passed
it
to
the
next

of
giving
such
trouble
to
neighbours
in
washing
up
when
so
much
work

be
done
in

already
continued
oak
in
a
moister
tone
after
recovering
from
the
stoppage
of
breath
which
is
occasioned
by

a
genial

pleasant
gentleman
whom
to
meet
anywhere
in
your
travels
was
to
know
to
know

to

with

to

with
was
unfortunately
to
pay
for
a
mouthful
of

exactly

said

a
person
who
held
notions
of
share
and
share
alike
where
liquor
was
concerned
as
the
vessel
showed
signs
of
approaching
him
in
its
gradual
revolution
among
them
having
at
this
moment
reached
the
end
of
a
wistful
gaze
into
henry
did
not
refuse
he
was
a
man
of
more
than
middle
age
with
eyebrows
high
up
in
his
forehead
who
laid
it
down
that
the
law
of
the
world
was
bad
with
a
look
through
his
listeners
at
the
world
alluded
to
as
it
presented
itself
to
his
imagination
he
always
signed
his
name
insisting
upon
that
spelling
and
if
any
passing
schoolmaster
ventured
to
remark
that
the
second
was
superfluous
and
he
received
the
reply
that
was
the
name
he
was
christened
and
the
name
he
would
stick
the
tone
of
one
to
whom
orthographical
differences
were
matters
which
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
personal
character
jan
coggan
who
had
passed
the
cup
to
henery
was
a
crimson
man
with
a
spacious
countenance
and
private
glimmer
in
his
eye
whose
name
had
appeared
on
the
marriage
register
of
weatherbury
and
neighbouring
parishes
as
best
man
and
chief
witness
in
countless
unions
of
the
previous
twenty
years

at
joseph
poorgrass
with
pitying
reproach
hardly
looked
at
her
at
all
simpered
joseph
reducing
his
body
smaller
whilst
talking
apparently
from
a
meek
sense
of
undue
prominence
when
i
seed
her
nothing
but
blushes
with
me
feller
said
clark
a
curious
nature
for
a
man
said
jan
coggan
continued
joseph
shyness
which
was
so
painful
as
a
defect
filling
him
with
a
mild
complacency
now
that
it
was
regarded
as
an
interesting
study
blush
blush
blush
with
me
every
minute
of
the
time
when
she
was
speaking
to
believe
ye
joseph
poorgrass
for
we
all
know
ye
to
be
a
very
bashful
awkward
gift
for
a
man
poor
soul
said
the
maltster
how
long
have
ye
have
suffered
from
it
joseph
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
was
concerned
to
her
heart
about
but
all
ye
ever
go
into
the
world
to
try
and
stop
it
joseph
poorgrass
ay
tried
all
sorts
company
they
took
me
to
greenhill
fair
and
into
a
great
gay
show
where
there
were
riding
upon
horses
with
hardly
anything
on
but
their
smocks
but
it
cure
me
a
morsel
and
then
i
was
put
at
the
skittle
alley
at
the
back
of
the
arms
in
casterbridge
a
horrible
sinful
situation
and
a
very
curious
place
for
a
good
man
i
had
to
stand
and
look
people
in
the
face
from
morning
till
night
but
no
was
just
as
bad
as
ever
after
all
blushes
hev
been
in
the
family
for
generations
there
a
happy
providence
that
i
be
no
said
jacob
smallbury
deepening
his
thoughts
to
a
profounder
view
of
the
subject
a
thought
to
look
at
that
ye
might
have
been
worse
but
even
as
you
be
a
very
bad
affliction
for
joseph
for
ye
see
shepherd
though
very
well
for
a
woman
dang
it
all
awkward
for
a
man
like
him
poor
feller
said
gabriel
recovering
from
a
meditation
very
awkward
for
the
and
very
timid
too
observed
jan
coggan
he
had
been
working
late
at
yalbury
bottom
and
had
had
a
drap
of
drink
and
lost
his
way
as
he
was
coming
through
yalbury
wood
ye
master
poorgrass
no
no
not
that
story
expostulated
the
modest
man
forcing
a
laugh
to
bury
his
concern
so
lost
himself
quite
continued
coggan
with
an
impassive
face
implying
that
a
true
narrative
like
time
and
tide
must
run
its
course
and
would
respect
no
man
as
he
was
coming
along
in
the
middle
of
the
night
much
afeared
and
not
able
to
find
his
way
out
of
the
trees
nohow
cried
out
a
owl
in
a
tree
happened
to
be
crying
as
owls
do
you
know
gabriel
nodded
joseph
all
in
a
tremble
said
poorgrass
of
weatherbury
sir
no
too
much
said
the
timid
man
becoming
a
man
of
brazen
courage
all
of
a
sudden
say
take
my
oath
i
say
poorgrass
weatherbury
no
no
right
is
right
and
i
never
said
sir
to
the
bird
knowing
very
well
that
no
man
of
a
rank
would
be
hollering
there
at
that
time
night
poorgrass
of
weatherbury
every
word
i
said
and
i
said
that
if
been
for
keeper
metheglin
there
a
merciful
thing
it
ended
where
it
the
question
of
which
was
right
being
tacitly
waived
by
the
company
jan
went
on
meditatively
the
fearfullest
man
ye
joseph
ay
another
time
ye
were
lost
by
gate
ye
joseph
was
replied
poorgrass
as
if
there
were
some
conditions
too
serious
even
for
modesty
to
remember
itself
under
this
being
one
that
were
the
middle
of
the
night
too
the
gate
would
not
open
try
how
he
would
and
knowing
there
was
the
hand
in
it
he
kneeled
said
joseph
acquiring
confidence
from
the
warmth
of
the
fire
the
cider
and
a
perception
of
the
narrative
capabilities
of
the
experience
alluded
to
heart
died
within
me
that
time
but
i
kneeled
down
and
said
the
prayer
and
then
the
belief
right
through
and
then
the
ten
commandments
in
earnest
prayer
but
no
the
gate
open
and
then
i
went
on
with
dearly
beloved
brethren
and
thinks
i
this
makes
four
and
all
i
know
out
of
book
and
if
this
do
it
nothing
will
and
a
lost
man
well
when
i
got
to
saying
after
me
i
rose
from
my
knees
and
found
the
gate
would
neighbours
the
gate
opened
the
same
as
a
meditation
on
the
obvious
inference
was
indulged
in
by
all
and
during
its
continuance
each
directed
his
vision
into
the
ashpit
which
glowed
like
a
desert
in
the
tropics
under
a
vertical
sun
shaping
their
eyes
long
and
liny
partly
because
of
the
light
partly
from
the
depth
of
the
subject
discussed
gabriel
broke
the
silence
sort
of
a
place
is
this
to
live
at
and
what
sort
of
a
is
she
to
work
under
bosom
thrilled
gently
as
he
thus
slipped
under
the
notice
of
the
assembly
the
subject
of
his
heart
know
little
of
she
only
showed
herself
a
few
days
ago
her
uncle
was
took
bad
and
the
doctor
was
called
with
his
skill
but
he
save
the
man
as
i
take
it
going
to
keep
on
the
farm
about
the
shape
said
jan
coggan
a
very
good
family
as
soon
be
under
as
under
one
here
and
there
her
uncle
was
a
very
fair
sort
of
man
did
ye
know
en
at
used
to
go
to
his
house
my
first
wife
charlotte
who
was
his
dairymaid
well
a
very
man
were
farmer
everdene
and
i
being
a
respectable
young
fellow
was
allowed
to
call
and
see
her
and
drink
as
much
ale
as
i
liked
but
not
to
carry
away
my
skin
i
mane
of
ay
jan
coggan
we
know
yer
so
you
see
beautiful
ale
and
i
wished
to
value
his
kindness
as
much
as
i
could
and
not
to
be
so
as
to
drink
only
a
thimbleful
which
would
have
been
insulting
the
master
coggan
so
corroborated
mark
clark
so
i
used
to
eat
a
lot
of
salt
fish
afore
going
and
then
by
the
time
i
got
there
i
were
as
dry
as
a
thorough
dry
that
that
ale
would
slip
slip
down
sweet
happy
times
heavenly
times
such
lovely
drunks
as
i
used
to
have
at
that
house
you
can
mind
jacob
you
used
to
go
me
can
said
jacob
one
too
that
we
had
at
head
on
a
white
monday
was
a
pretty
but
for
a
wet
of
the
better
class
that
brought
you
no
nearer
to
the
horned
man
than
you
were
afore
you
begun
there
was
none
like
those
in
farmer
kitchen
not
a
single
damn
allowed
no
not
a
bare
poor
one
even
at
the
most
cheerful
moment
when
all
were
blindest
though
the
good
old
word
of
sin
thrown
in
here
and
there
at
such
times
is
a
great
relief
to
a
merry
said
the
maltster
requires
her
swearing
at
the
regular
times
or
not
herself
and
unholy
exclamations
is
a
necessity
of
charlotte
continued
a
word
of
the
sort
would
charlotte
allow
nor
the
smallest
item
of
taking
in
vain
ay
poor
charlotte
i
wonder
if
she
had
the
good
fortune
to
get
into
heaven
when
died
but
was
never
much
in
way
and
perhaps
went
downwards
after
all
poor
did
any
of
you
know
miss
father
and
mother
inquired
the
shepherd
who
found
some
difficulty
in
keeping
the
conversation
in
the
desired
channel
knew
them
a
little
said
jacob
smallbury
they
were
townsfolk
and
live
here
been
dead
for
years
father
what
sort
of
people
were
father
and
mother
said
the
maltster
much
to
look
at
but
she
was
a
lovely
woman
he
was
fond
enough
of
her
as
his
to
kiss
her
scores
and
times
so
said
observed
coggan
was
very
proud
of
her
too
when
they
were
married
as
been
told
said
the
maltster
said
coggan
admired
her
so
much
that
he
used
to
light
the
candle
three
times
a
night
to
look
at
love
i
have
supposed
it
in
the
universe
murmured
joseph
poorgrass
who
habitually
spoke
on
a
large
scale
in
his
moral
reflections
to
be
sure
said
gabriel
true
enough
i
knowed
the
man
and
woman
both
well
levi
was
the
name
sure
saith
i
in
my
hurry
but
he
were
of
a
higher
circle
of
life
than
was
a
really
worth
scores
of
pounds
and
he
became
a
very
celebrated
bankrupt
two
or
three
i
thought
he
was
quite
a
common
man
said
joseph
no
no
that
man
failed
for
heaps
of
money
hundreds
in
gold
and
the
maltster
being
rather
short
of
breath
coggan
after
absently
scrutinising
a
coal
which
had
fallen
among
the
ashes
took
up
the
narrative
with
a
private
twirl
of
his
eye
now
hardly
believe
it
but
that
miss
one
of
the
ficklest
husbands
alive
after
a
while
understand
want
to
be
fickle
but
he
help
it
the
pore
feller
were
faithful
and
true
enough
to
her
in
his
wish
but
his
heart
would
rove
do
what
he
would
he
spoke
to
me
in
real
tribulation
about
it
once
he
said
could
never
wish
for
a
handsomer
woman
than
got
but
feeling
ticketed
as
my
lawful
wife
i
help
my
wicked
heart
wandering
do
what
i
but
at
last
i
believe
he
cured
it
by
making
her
take
off
her
and
calling
her
by
her
maiden
name
as
they
sat
together
after
the
shop
was
shut
and
so
would
get
to
fancy
she
was
only
his
sweetheart
and
not
married
to
him
at
all
and
as
soon
as
he
could
thoroughly
fancy
he
was
doing
wrong
and
committing
the
seventh
got
to
like
her
as
well
as
ever
and
they
lived
on
a
perfect
picture
of
mutel
a
most
ungodly
remedy
murmured
joseph
poorgrass
we
ought
to
feel
deep
cheerfulness
that
a
happy
providence
kept
it
from
being
any
worse
you
see
he
might
have
gone
the
bad
road
and
given
his
eyes
to
unlawfulness
gross
unlawfulness
so
to
say
see
said
billy
smallbury
will
was
to
do
right
sure
enough
but
his
heart
chime
got
so
much
better
that
he
was
quite
godly
in
his
later
years
he
jan
said
joseph
poorgrass
got
himself
confirmed
over
again
in
a
more
serious
way
and
took
to
saying
almost
as
loud
as
the
clerk
and
he
liked
to
copy
comforting
verses
from
the
tombstones
he
used
too
to
hold
the
at
let
your
light
so
shine
and
stand
godfather
to
poor
little
children
and
he
kept
a
missionary
box
upon
his
table
to
nab
folks
unawares
when
they
called
yes
and
he
would
box
the
ears
if
they
laughed
in
church
till
they
could
hardly
stand
upright
and
do
other
deeds
of
piety
natural
to
the
saintly
at
that
time
he
thought
of
nothing
but
high
things
added
billy
smallbury
day
parson
thirdly
met
him
and
said
mister
everdene
a
fine
day
said
everdene
quite
thinking
only
of
religion
when
he
seed
a
parson
yes
he
was
a
very
christian
daughter
was
not
at
all
a
pretty
chiel
at
that
time
said
henery
fray
should
have
thought
have
growed
up
such
a
handsome
body
as
she
to
be
hoped
her
temper
is
as
good
as
her
yes
but
the
baily
will
have
most
to
do
with
the
business
and
ourselves
ah
henery
gazed
into
the
ashpit
and
smiled
volumes
of
ironical
knowledge
queer
christian
like
the
head
in
a
cowl
as
the
saying
is
volunteered
mark
clark
is
said
henery
implying
that
irony
must
cease
at
a
certain
point
we
two
man
and
man
i
believe
that
man
would
as
soon
tell
a
lie
sundays
as
i
do
faith
you
do
talk
said
gabriel
enough
said
the
man
of
bitter
moods
looking
round
upon
the
company
with
the
antithetic
laughter
that
comes
from
a
keener
appreciation
of
the
miseries
of
life
than
ordinary
men
are
capable
of
people
of
one
sort
and
people
of
another
but
that
your
souls
gabriel
thought
fit
to
change
the
subject
must
be
a
very
aged
man
malter
to
have
sons
growed
mild
and
ancient
he
remarked
so
old
that
mind
his
age
can
ye
father
interposed
jacob
growed
terrible
crooked
too
lately
jacob
continued
surveying
his
figure
which
was
rather
more
bowed
than
his
own
one
may
say
that
father
there
is
folk
will
last
a
long
while
said
the
maltster
grimly
and
not
in
the
best
humour
would
like
to
hear
the
pedigree
of
yer
life
ye
shepherd
that
i
should
said
gabriel
with
the
heartiness
of
a
man
who
had
longed
to
hear
it
for
several
months
may
your
age
be
malter
the
maltster
cleared
his
throat
in
an
exaggerated
form
for
emphasis
and
elongating
his
gaze
to
the
remotest
point
of
the
ashpit
said
in
the
slow
speech
justifiable
when
the
importance
of
a
subject
is
so
generally
felt
that
any
mannerism
must
be
tolerated
in
getting
at
it
i
mind
the
year
i
were
born
in
but
perhaps
i
can
reckon
up
the
places
lived
at
and
so
get
it
that
way
i
bode
at
upper
longpuddle
across
nodding
to
the
north
i
were
eleven
i
bode
seven
at
nodding
to
the
east
i
took
to
malting
i
went
therefrom
to
norcombe
and
malted
there
years
years
i
was
there
and
harvesting
ah
i
knowed
that
old
place
norcombe
years
afore
you
were
thought
of
master
oak
smiled
sincere
belief
in
the
fact
i
malted
at
durnover
four
year
and
four
year
and
i
was
fourteen
times
eleven
months
at
millpond
nodding
twills
hire
me
for
more
than
eleven
months
at
a
time
to
keep
me
from
being
chargeable
to
the
parish
if
so
be
i
was
disabled
then
i
was
three
year
at
mellstock
and
been
here
year
come
candlemas
how
much
is
that
and
seventeen
chuckled
another
old
gentleman
given
to
mental
arithmetic
and
little
conversation
who
had
hitherto
sat
unobserved
in
a
corner
then
my
age
said
the
maltster
emphatically
no
father
said
jacob
were
in
the
summer
and
your
malting
in
the
winter
of
the
same
years
and
ye
ought
to
halves
it
all
i
lived
through
the
summers
i
my
question
i
suppose
say
next
i
be
no
age
at
all
to
speak
of
we
said
gabriel
soothingly
be
a
very
old
aged
person
malter
attested
jan
coggan
also
soothingly
all
know
that
and
ye
must
have
a
wonderful
talented
constitution
to
be
able
to
live
so
long
he
neighbours
true
ye
must
malter
wonderful
said
the
meeting
unanimously
the
maltster
being
now
pacified
was
even
generous
enough
to
voluntarily
disparage
in
a
slight
degree
the
virtue
of
having
lived
a
great
many
years
by
mentioning
that
the
cup
they
were
drinking
out
of
was
three
years
older
than
he
while
the
cup
was
being
examined
the
end
of
gabriel
flute
became
visible
over
his
pocket
and
henery
fray
exclaimed
shepherd
i
seed
you
blowing
into
a
great
flute
by
now
at
casterbridge
did
said
gabriel
blushing
faintly
been
in
great
trouble
neighbours
and
was
driven
to
it
i
used
not
to
be
so
poor
as
i
be
mind
heart
said
mark
clark
should
take
it
shepherd
and
your
time
will
come
but
we
could
thank
ye
for
a
tune
if
ye
too
tired
drum
nor
trumpet
have
i
heard
since
christmas
said
jan
coggan
raise
a
tune
master
oak
that
i
will
said
gabriel
pulling
out
his
flute
and
putting
it
together
poor
tool
neighbours
but
such
as
i
can
do
ye
shall
have
and
oak
then
struck
up
to
the
fair
and
played
that
sparkling
melody
three
times
through
accenting
the
notes
in
the
third
round
in
a
most
artistic
and
lively
manner
by
bending
his
body
in
small
jerks
and
tapping
with
his
foot
to
beat
time
can
blow
the
flute
very
can
said
a
young
married
man
who
having
no
individuality
worth
mentioning
was
known
as
he
continued
as
lief
as
not
be
able
to
blow
into
a
flute
as
well
as
a
clever
man
and
a
true
comfort
for
us
to
have
such
a
shepherd
murmured
joseph
poorgrass
in
a
soft
cadence
ought
to
feel
full
thanksgiving
that
not
a
player
of
songs
instead
of
these
merry
tunes
for
have
been
just
as
easy
for
god
to
have
made
the
shepherd
a
loose
low
man
of
iniquity
so
to
speak
what
he
is
yes
for
our
and
sakes
we
should
feel
real
true
thanksgiving
dashed
in
mark
clark
conclusively
not
feeling
it
to
be
of
any
consequence
to
his
opinion
that
he
had
only
heard
about
a
word
and
of
what
joseph
had
said
added
joseph
beginning
to
feel
like
a
man
in
the
bible
evil
do
thrive
so
in
these
times
that
ye
may
be
as
much
deceived
in
the
cleanest
shaved
and
whitest
shirted
man
as
in
the
raggedest
tramp
upon
the
turnpike
if
i
may
term
it
i
can
mind
yer
face
now
shepherd
said
henery

criticising
gabriel
with
misty
eyes
as
he
entered
upon
his
second
tune
i
see
blowing
into
the
flute
i
know
to
be
the
same
man
i
see
play
at
casterbridge
for
yer
mouth
were
scrimped
up
and
yer
eyes
out
like
a
strangled
as
they
be
a
pity
that
playing
the
flute
should
make
a
man
look
such
a
scarecrow
observed
mark
clark
with
additional
criticism
of
countenance
the
latter
person
jerking
out
with
the
ghastly
grimace
required
by
the
instrument
the
chorus
of
durden
and
and
and
and
hope
you
mind
that
young
bad
manners
in
naming
your
features
whispered
joseph
to
gabriel
at
all
said
oak
by
nature
ye
be
a
very
handsome
man
shepherd
continued
joseph
poorgrass
with
winning
sauvity
that
ye

shepard
said
the
company
you
very
much
said
oak
in
the
modest
tone
good
manners
demanded
thinking
however
that
he
would
never
let
bathsheba
see
him
playing
the
flute
in
this
resolve
showing
a
discretion
equal
to
that
related
to
its
sagacious
inventress
the
divine
minerva
herself
when
i
and
my
wife
were
married
at
norcombe
church
said
the
old
maltster
not
pleased
at
finding
himself
left
out
of
the

called
the
handsomest
couple
in
the
said
if
ye
altered
now
malter
said
a
voice
with
the
vigour
natural
to
the
enunciation
of
a
remarkably
evident
truism
it
came
from
the
old
man
in
the
background
whose
offensiveness
and
spiteful
ways
were
barely
atoned
for
by
the
occasional
chuckle
he
contributed
to
general
laughs
no
no
said
gabriel
ye
play
no
more
said
susan
husband
the
young
married
man
who
had
spoken
once
before
must
be
moving
and
when
tunes
going
on
i
seem
as
if
hung
in
wires
if
i
thought
after
left
that
music
was
still
playing
and
i
not
there
i
should
be
quite
yer
hurry
then
laban
inquired
coggan
used
to
bide
as
late
as
the
ye
see
neighbours
i
was
lately
married
to
a
woman
and
my
vocation
now
and
so
ye
the
young
man
halted
lamely
lords
new

as
the
saying
is
i
suppose
remarked
coggan
ha
said
susan
husband
in
a
tone
intended
to
imply
his
habitual
reception
of
jokes
without
minding
them
at
all
the
young
man
then
wished
them
and
withdrew
henery
fray
was
the
first
to
follow
then
gabriel
arose
and
went
off
with
jan
coggan
who
had
offered
him
a
lodging
a
few
minutes
later
when
the
remaining
ones
were
on
their
legs
and
about
to
depart
fray
came
back
again
in
a
hurry
flourishing
his
finger
ominously
he
threw
a
gaze
teeming
with
tidings
just
where
his
eye
alighted
by
accident
which
happened
to
be
in
joseph
face
the
matter
the
matter
henery
said
joseph
starting
back
henery
asked
jacob
and
mark
clark
said
so
yes
i
said
so
found
out
stealing
anything
it
is
the
news
is
that
after
miss
everdene
got
home
she
went
out
again
to
see
all
was
safe
as
she
usually
do
and
coming
in
found
baily
pennyways
creeping
down
the
granary
steps
with
half
a
bushel
of
barley
she
fleed
at
him
like
a
such
a
tomboy
as
she
course
i
speak
with
closed
doors
do
fleed
at
him
and
to
cut
a
long
story
short
he
owned
to
having
carried
off
five
sack
altogether
upon
her
promising
not
to
persecute
him
well
turned
out
neck
and
crop
and
my
question
is
going
to
be
baily
now
the
question
was
such
a
profound
one
that
henery
was
obliged
to
drink
there
and
then
from
the
large
cup
till
the
bottom
was
distinctly
visible
inside
before
he
had
replaced
it
on
the
table
in
came
the
young
man
susan
husband
in
a
still
greater
hurry
ye
heard
the
news
all
over
parish
baily
pennyways
besides
that
a
morsel
of
it
they
replied
looking
into
the
very
midst
of
laban
tall
as
if
to
meet
his
words
down
his
throat
a
night
of
horrors
murmured
joseph
poorgrass
waving
his
hands
spasmodically
had
the
ringing
in
my
left
ear
quite
bad
enough
for
a
murder
and
seen
a
magpie
all
alone
youngest
be
found
been
wanting
to
lock
up
the
door
these
two
hours
but
she
come
in
and
they
know
what
to
do
about
going
to
bed
for
fear
of
locking
her
out
they
be
so
concerned
if
she
been
noticed
in
such
low
spirits
these
last
few
days
and
maryann
think
the
beginning
of
a
inquest
has
happened
to
the
poor

from
joseph

billy

with
a
vivid
sense
of
detail
everdene
wants
to
speak
to
one
or
two
of
us
before
we
go
to
bed
what
with
this
trouble
about
the
baily
and
now
about
the
girl
is
almost
they
all
hastened
up
the
lane
to
the
farmhouse
excepting
the
old
maltster
whom
neither
news
fire
rain
nor
thunder
could
draw
from
his
hole
there
as
the
footsteps
died
away
he
sat
down
again
and
continued
gazing
as
usual
into
the
furnace
with
his
red
bleared
eyes
from
the
bedroom
window
above
their
heads
head
and
shoulders
robed
in
mystic
white
were
dimly
seen
extended
into
the
air
any
of
my
men
among
you
she
said
anxiously
several
said
susan
husband
morning
i
wish
two
or
three
of
you
to
make
inquiries
in
the
villages
round
if
they
have
seen
such
a
person
as
fanny
robin
do
it
quietly
there
is
no
reason
for
alarm
as
yet
she
must
have
left
whilst
we
were
all
at
the
beg
yer
pardon
but
had
she
any
young
man
courting
her
in
the
parish
asked
jacob
smallbury
know
said
bathsheba
never
heard
of
any
such
thing
said
two
or
three
is
hardly
likely
either
continued
bathsheba
any
lover
of
hers
might
have
come
to
the
house
if
he
had
been
a
respectable
lad
the
most
mysterious
matter
connected
with
her
the
only
thing
which
gives
me
serious
that
she
was
seen
to
go
out
of
the
house
by
maryann
with
only
her
indoor
working
gown
even
a
you
mean
excusing
my
words
that
a
young
woman
would
hardly
go
to
see
her
young
man
without
dressing
up
said
jacob
turning
his
mental
vision
upon
past
experiences
would
not
had
i
think
a
bundle
though
i
see
very
well
said
a
female
voice
from
another
window
which
seemed
that
of
maryann
she
had
no
young
man
about
here
hers
lives
in
casterbridge
and
i
believe
a
you
know
his
name
bathsheba
said
mistress
she
was
very
close
about
i
might
be
able
to
find
out
if
i
went
to
casterbridge
barracks
said
william
smallbury
well
if
she
return
mind
you
go
there
and
try
to
discover
which
man
it
is
and
see
him
i
feel
more
responsible
than
i
should
if
she
had
had
any
friends
or
relations
alive
i
do
hope
she
has
come
to
no
harm
through
a
man
of
that
kind
and
then
this
disgraceful
affair
of
the
i
speak
of
him
bathsheba
had
so
many
reasons
for
uneasiness
that
it
seemed
she
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
dwell
upon
any
particular
one
as
i
told
you
then
she
said
in
conclusion
closing
the
casement
ay
mistress
we
will
they
replied
and
moved
away
that
night
at
gabriel
oak
beneath
the
screen
of
closed
eyelids
was
busy
with
fancies
and
full
of
movement
like
a
river
flowing
rapidly
under
its
ice
night
had
always
been
the
time
at
which
he
saw
bathsheba
most
vividly
and
through
the
slow
hours
of
shadow
he
tenderly
regarded
her
image
now
it
is
rarely
that
the
pleasures
of
the
imagination
will
compensate
for
the
pain
of
sleeplessness
but
they
possibly
did
with
oak
for
the
delight
of
merely
seeing
her
effaced
for
the
time
his
perception
of
the
great
difference
between
seeing
and
possessing
he
also
thought
of
plans
for
fetching
his
few
utensils
and
books
from
norcombe
young
best
sure
veterinary
and
constituted
his
library
and
though
a
limited
series
it
was
one
from
which
he
had
acquired
more
sound
information
by
diligent
perusal
than
many
a
man
of
opportunities
has
done
from
a
furlong
of
laden
shelves
chapter
ix
the
by
daylight
the
bower
of
mistress
bathsheba
everdene
presented
itself
as
a
hoary
building
of
the
early
stage
of
classic
renaissance
as
regards
its
architecture
and
of
a
proportion
which
told
at
a
glance
that
as
is
so
frequently
the
case
it
had
once
been
the
memorial
hall
upon
a
small
estate
around
it
now
altogether
effaced
as
a
distinct
property
and
merged
in
the
vast
tract
of
a
landlord
which
comprised
several
such
modest
demesnes
fluted
pilasters
worked
from
the
solid
stone
decorated
its
front
and
above
the
roof
the
chimneys
were
panelled
or
columnar
some
coped
gables
with
finials
and
like
features
still
retaining
traces
of
their
gothic
extraction
soft
brown
mosses
like
faded
velveteen
formed
cushions
upon
the
stone
tiling
and
tufts
of
the
houseleek
or
sengreen
sprouted
from
the
eaves
of
the
low
surrounding
buildings
a
gravel
walk
leading
from
the
door
to
the
road
in
front
was
encrusted
at
the
sides
with
more
it
was
a
variety
the
of
the
gravel
being
visible
to
the
width
of
only
a
foot
or
two
in
the
centre
this
circumstance
and
the
generally
sleepy
air
of
the
whole
prospect
here
together
with
the
animated
and
contrasting
state
of
the
reverse
façade
suggested
to
the
imagination
that
on
the
adaptation
of
the
building
for
farming
purposes
the
vital
principle
of
the
house
had
turned
round
inside
its
body
to
face
the
other
way
reversals
of
this
kind
strange
deformities
tremendous
paralyses
are
often
seen
to
be
inflicted
by
trade
upon
individual
or
in
the
aggregate
as
streets
and
were
originally
planned
for
pleasure
alone
lively
voices
were
heard
this
morning
in
the
upper
rooms
the
main
staircase
to
which
was
of
hard
oak
the
balusters
heavy
as
being
turned
and
moulded
in
the
quaint
fashion
of
their
century
the
handrail
as
stout
as
a
and
the
stairs
themselves
continually
twisting
round
like
a
person
trying
to
look
over
his
shoulder
going
up
the
floors
above
were
found
to
have
a
very
irregular
surface
rising
to
ridges
sinking
into
valleys
and
being
just
then
uncarpeted
the
face
of
the
boards
was
seen
to
be
eaten
into
innumerable
vermiculations
every
window
replied
by
a
clang
to
the
opening
and
shutting
of
every
door
a
tremble
followed
every
bustling
movement
and
a
creak
accompanied
a
walker
about
the
house
like
a
spirit
wherever
he
went
in
the
room
from
which
the
conversation
proceeded
bathsheba
and
her
liddy
smallbury
were
to
be
discovered
sitting
upon
the
floor
and
sorting
a
complication
of
papers
books
bottles
and
rubbish
spread
out
from
the
household
stores
of
the
late
occupier
liddy
the
was
about
equal
in
age
and
her
face
was
a
prominent
advertisement
of
the
english
country
girl
the
beauty
her
features
might
have
lacked
in
form
was
amply
made
up
for
by
perfection
of
hue
which
at
this
was
the
softened
ruddiness
on
a
surface
of
high
rotundity
that
we
meet
with
in
a
terburg
or
a
gerard
douw
and
like
the
presentations
of
those
great
colourists
it
was
a
face
which
kept
well
back
from
the
boundary
between
comeliness
and
the
ideal
though
elastic
in
nature
she
was
less
daring
than
bathsheba
and
occasionally
showed
some
earnestness
which
consisted
half
of
genuine
feeling
and
half
of
mannerliness
superadded
by
way
of
duty
through
a
door
the
noise
of
a
led
up
to
the
charwoman
maryann
money
a
person
who
for
a
face
had
a
circular
disc
furrowed
less
by
age
than
by
long
gazes
of
perplexity
at
distant
objects
to
think
of
her
was
to
get
to
speak
of
her
was
to
raise
the
image
of
a
dried
normandy
pippin
your
scrubbing
a
moment
said
bathsheba
through
the
door
to
her
hear
maryann
suspended
the
brush
the
tramp
of
a
horse
was
apparent
approaching
the
front
of
the
building
the
paces
slackened
turned
in
at
the
wicket
and
what
was
most
unusual
came
up
the
mossy
path
close
to
the
door
the
door
was
tapped
with
the
end
of
a
crop
or
stick
impertinence

liddy
in
a
low
voice

up
the
footpath
like
that
why

at

gate
lord
a
gentleman
i

the
top
of
his
quiet
said
bathsheba
the
further
expression
of

coggan

bathsheba
continued
resounded
more
decisively
from
oak
you
go
said
she
fluttering
under
the
onset
of
a
crowd
of
romantic
possibilities
a
mess
the
argument
was
unanswerable
after
a
glance
at
maryann
must
said
bathsheba
liddy
held
up
her
hands
and
arms
coated
with
dust
from
the
rubbish
they
were
sorting
and
looked
imploringly
at
her
mistress
coggan
is
going
said
bathsheba
exhaling
her
relief
in
the
form
of
a
long
breath
which
had
lain
in
her
bosom
a
minute
or
more
the
door
opened
and
a
deep
voice
miss
everdene
at
home
see
sir
said
coggan
and
in
a
minute
appeared
in
the
room
what
a
thirtover
place
this
world
is
continued
coggan
a
lady
who
had
a
voice
for
each
class
of
remark
according
to
the
emotion
involved
who
could
toss
a
pancake
or
twirl
a
mop
with
the
accuracy
of
pure
mathematics
and
who
at
this
moment
showed
hands
shaggy
with
fragments
of
dough
and
arms
encrusted
with
flour
am
never
up
to
my
elbows
miss
in
making
a
pudding
but
one
of
two
things
do
my
nose
must
needs
begin
tickling
and
i
live
without
scratching
it
or
somebody
knocks
at
the
door
boldwood
wanting
to
see
you
miss
a
dress
being
a
part
of
her
countenance
and
any
disorder
in
the
one
being
of
the
same
nature
with
a
malformation
or
wound
in
the
other
bathsheba
said
at
see
him
in
this
state
whatever
shall
i
do
were
hardly
naturalized
in
weatherbury
farmhouses
so
liddy
a
fright
with
dust
and
come
sounds
very
well
said
coggan
critically
i
see
will
coggan
went
downstairs
and
returned
the
answer
as
requested
adding
however
on
her
own
responsibility
is
dusting
bottles
sir
and
is
quite
a
why
very
well
said
the
deep
voice
indifferently
i
wanted
to
ask
was
if
anything
had
been
heard
of
fanny
robin
we
may
know
william
smallbury
is
gone
to
casterbridge
where
her
young
man
lives
as
is
supposed
and
the
other
men
be
inquiring
about
the
tramp
then
recommenced
and
retreated
and
the
door
closed
is
boldwood
said
bathsheba
at
little
old
is
he
i
should
a
bother
this
dusting
is
i
am
always
in
some
unfortunate
plight
or
other
bathsheba
said
complainingly
should
he
inquire
about
fanny
because
as
she
had
no
friends
in
her
childhood
he
took
her
and
put
her
to
school
and
got
her
her
place
here
under
your
uncle
a
very
kind
man
that
way
but
was
such
a
hopeless
man
for
a
woman
been
courted
by
sixes
and
the
girls
gentle
and
simple

at

for

months
like
a
slave

the

taylors
spent
a
year
upon
him
and
he
cost

of
tears

twenty
worth
of

clothes

money

as

have
been
thrown
out
of

a
little
boy
came
up
at
this
moment
and
looked
in
upon
them
this
child
was
one
of
the
coggans
who
with
the
smallburys
were
as
common
among
the
families
of
this
district
as
the
avons
and
derwents
among
our
rivers
he
always
had
a
loosened
tooth
or
a
cut
finger
to
show
to
particular
friends
which
he
did
with
an
air
of
being
thereby
elevated
above
the
common
herd
of
afflictionless
which
exhibition
people
were
expected
to
say
child
with
a
dash
of
congratulation
as
well
as
pity
got
a

in
a
scanning
measure
gave
it

liddy
he
gave
it
to
me
for
opening
the
did
he
say
said
are
you
going
my
little
man
and
i
said
miss
please
and
he
said
is
a
staid
woman
she
my
little
man
and
i
said
naughty
child
what
did
you
say
that
for
he
gave
me
the
penny
a
pucker
everything
is
in
said
bathsheba
discontentedly
when
the
child
had
gone
away
maryann
or
go
on
with
your
scrubbing
or
do
something
you
ought
to
be
married
by
this
time
and
not
here
troubling
me
i
did
but
what
between
the
poor
men
i
have
and
the
rich
men
who
have
me
i
stand
as
a
pelican
in
the
wilderness
anybody
ever
want
to
marry
you
miss
liddy
ventured
to
ask
when
they
were
again
alone
of
i
daresay
bathsheba
paused
as
if
about
to
refuse
a
reply
but
the
temptation
to
say
yes
since
it
was
really
in
her
power
was
irresistible
by
aspiring
virginity
in
spite
of
her
spleen
at
having
been
published
as
old
man
wanted
to

experienced

good

for

looked
from
a
back
window
into
the
courtyard
behind
which
was
now
getting
and
dim
with
the
earliest
films
of
night
a
crooked
file
of
men
was
approaching
the
back
door
the
whole
string
of
trailing
individuals
advanced
in
the
completest
balance
of
intention
like
the
remarkable
creatures
known
as
chain

which
distinctly
organized
in
other
respects

then

x
mistress
and
men
later
bathsheba
in
finished
dress
and
followed
by
liddy
entered
the
upper
end
of
the
old
hall
to
find
that
her
men
had
all
deposited
themselves
on
a
long
form
and
a
settle
at
the
lower
extremity
she
sat
down
at
a
table
and
opened
the
pen
in
her
hand
with
a
canvas
beside
her
from
this
she
poured
a
small
heap
of
coin
liddy
chose
a
position
at
her
elbow
and
began
to
sew
sometimes
pausing
and
looking
round
or
with
the
air
of
a
privileged
person
taking
up
one
of
the
lying
before
her
and
surveying
it
merely
as
a
work
of
art
while
strictly
preventing
her
countenance
from
expressing
any
wish
to
possess
it
as
money
before
i
begin
men
said
bathsheba
have
two
matters
to
speak
of
the
first
is
that
the
bailiff
is
dismissed
for
thieving
and
that
i
have
formed
a
resolution
to
have
no
bailiff
at
all
but
to
manage
everything
with
my
own
head
and
the
men
breathed
an
audible
breath
of
amazement
next
matter
is
have
you
heard
anything
of
fanny
you
done
anything
met
farmer

said
jacob

i
went
with
him

slightly
at

in

undertone

henery

joseph

his

became
dry
with
fear
of
some
terrible
consequences
as
he

summarily
speaking
and
henery
slinking
off
to
a
corner

pattens

is
that
bathsheba
asked

his
lawful
wife
continued
the
voice
with
greater
prominence
of
manner
and
tone
this
lady
called
herself
looked
thirty
passed
as
and
was
forty
she
was
a
woman
who
never
like
some
newly
married
showed
conjugal
tenderness
in
public
perhaps
because
she
had
none
to
show
you
are

bathsheba

the

a

well
enough
but
a
poor
gawkhammer
mortal
the
wife
replied
laughed
the
married
man
with
a
hideous
effort
of
appreciation
for
he
was
as
irrepressibly
under
ghastly
snubs
as
a
parliamentary
candidate
on
the
hustings
the
names
remaining
were
called
in
the
same
manner
i
think
i
have
done
with
you

william

returned
new

himself
official

by

a
very
good
lad
henery
said
shepherd
oak
mind
his
youth
he
added
turning
with
an
apologetic
smile
to
the
shepherd
who
had
just
appeared
on
the
scene
and
was
now
leaning
against
the
doorpost
with
his
arms
folded
i
mind
that
said
gabriel
did
cain
come
by
such
a
name
asked
bathsheba
you
see
mem
his
pore
mother
not
being
a
woman
made
a
mistake
at
his
christening
thinking
abel
killed
cain
and
called
en
cain
meaning
abel
all
the
time
the
parson
put
it
right
but
too
late
for
the
name
could
never
be
got
rid
of
in
the
parish
very
unfortunate
for
the
is
rather
however
we
soften
it
down
as
much
as
we
can
and
call
him
cainy
ah
pore
she
cried
her
heart
out
about
it
almost
she
was
brought
up
by
a
very
heathen
father
and
mother
who
never
sent
her
to
church
or
school
and
it
shows
how
the
sins
of
the
parents
are
visited
upon
the
children
mr
fray
here
drew
up
his
features
to
the
mild
degree
of
melancholy
required
when
the
persons
involved
in
the
given
misfortune
do
not
belong
to
your
own
family
well
then
cainey
ball
to
be
and
you
quite
understand
your
duties
i
mean
gabriel
oak
well
i
thank
you
miss
everdene
said
shepherd
oak
from
the
doorpost
i
gabriel
was
rather
staggered
by
the
remarkable
coolness
of
her
manner
certainly
nobody
without
previous
information
would
have
dreamt
that
oak
and
the
handsome
woman
before
whom
he
stood
had
ever
been
other
than
strangers
but
perhaps
her
air
was
the
inevitable
result
of
the
social
rise
which
had
advanced
her
from
a
cottage
to
a
large
house
and
fields
the
case
is
not
unexampled
in
high
places
when
in
the
writings
of
the
later
poets
jove
and
his
family
are
found
to
have
moved
from
their
cramped
quarters
on
the
peak
of
olympus
into
the
wide
sky
above
it
their
words
show
a
proportionate
increase
of
arrogance
and
reserve
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
passage
combining
in
their
character
the
qualities
both
of
weight
and
measure
rather
at
the
expense
of
velocity
all
billy
smallbury
come
from
the
news
said
bathsheba
as
william
after
marching
to
the
middle
of
the
hall
took
a
handkerchief
from
his
hat
and
wiped
his
forehead
from
its
centre
to
its
remoter
boundaries
should
have
been
sooner
miss
he
said
it
been
for
the
he
then
stamped
with
each
foot
severely
and
on
looking
down
his
boots
were
perceived
to
be
clogged
with
snow
at
last
is
it
said
henery
what
about
fanny
said
bathsheba
in
round
numbers
run
away
with
the
soldiers
said
william
not
a
steady
girl
like
fanny
tell
ye
all
particulars
when
i
got
to
casterbridge
barracks
they
said
eleventh
be
gone
away
and
new
troops
have
the
eleventh
left
last
week
for
melchester
and
onwards
the
route
came
from
government
like
a
thief
in
the
night
as
is
his
nature
to
and
afore
the
eleventh
knew
it
almost
they
were
on
the
march
they
passed
near
gabriel
had
listened
with
interest
saw
them
go
he
said
continued
william
pranced
down
the
street
playing
girl
i
left
behind
me
so
said
in
glorious
notes
of
triumph
every
inside
shook
with
the
blows
of
the
great
drum
to
his
deepest
vitals
and
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
throughout
the
town
among
the
people
and
the
nameless
women
not
gone
to
any
war
but
they
be
gone
to
take
the
places
of
them
who
may
which
is
very
close
connected
and
so
i
said
to
myself
young
man
was
one
of
the
regiment
and
gone
after
him
there
it
in
black
and
you
find
out
his
name
nobody
knew
it
i
believe
he
was
higher
in
rank
than
a
gabriel
remained
musing
and
said
nothing
for
he
was
in
doubt
we
are
not
likely
to
know
more
at
any
rate
said
bathsheba
one
of
you
had
better
run
across
to
farmer
and
tell
him
that
she
then
rose
but
before
retiring
addressed
a
few
words
to
them
with
a
pretty
dignity
to
which
her
mourning
dress
added
a
soberness
that
was
hardly
to
be
found
in
the
words
themselves
mind
you
have
a
mistress
instead
of
a
master
i
yet
know
my
powers
or
my
talents
in
farming
but
i
shall
do
my
best
and
if
you
serve
me
well
so
shall
i
serve
you
any
unfair
ones
among
you
if
there
are
any
such
but
i
hope
not
suppose
that
because
a
woman
i
understand
the
difference
between
bad
and
all
liddy
well
shall
be
up
before
you
are
awake
i
shall
be
afield
before
you
are
up
and
i
shall
have
breakfasted
before
you
are
afield
in
short
i
shall
astonish
you
all
so
all
then
this
small
thesmothete
stepped
from
the
table
and
surged
out
of
the
hall
her
black
silk
dress
licking
up
a
few
straws
and
dragging
them
along
with
a
scratching
noise
upon
the
floor
liddy
elevating
her
feelings
to
the
occasion
from
a
sense
of
grandeur
floated
off
behind
bathsheba
with
a
milder
dignity
not
entirely
free
from
travesty
and
the
door
was
closed
chapter
xi
outside
the
meeting
for
dreariness
nothing
could
surpass
a
prospect
in
the
outskirts
of
a
certain
town
and
military
station
many
miles
north
of
weatherbury
at
a
later
hour
on
this
same
snowy
that
may
be
called
a
prospect
of
which
the
chief
constituent
was
darkness
it
was
a
night
when
sorrow
may
come
to
the
brightest
without
causing
any
great
sense
of
incongruity
when
with
impressible
persons
love
becomes
solicitousness
hope
sinks
to
misgiving
and
faith
to
hope
when
the
exercise
of
memory
does
not
stir
feelings
of
regret
at
opportunities
for
ambition
that
have
been
passed
by
and
anticipation
does
not
prompt
to
enterprise
the
scene
was
a
public
path
bordered
on
the
left
hand
by
a
river
behind
which
rose
a
high
wall
on
the
right
was
a
tract
of
land
partly
meadow
and
partly
moor
reaching
at
its
remote
verge
to
a
wide
undulating
upland
the
changes
of
the
seasons
are
less
obtrusive
on
spots
of
this
kind
than
amid
woodland
scenery
still
to
a
close
observer
they
are
just
as
perceptible
the
difference
is
that
their
media
of
manifestation
are
less
trite
and
familiar
than
such
ones
as
the
bursting
of
the
buds
or
the
fall
of
the
leaf
many
are
not
so
stealthy
and
gradual
as
we
may
be
apt
to
imagine
in
considering
the
general
torpidity
of
a
moor
or
waste
winter
in
coming
to
the
country
hereabout
advanced
in
stages
wherein
might
have
been
successively
observed
the
retreat
of
the
snakes
the
transformation
of
the
ferns
the
filling
of
the
pools
a
rising
of
fogs
the
embrowning
by
frost
the
collapse
of
the
fungi
and
an
obliteration
by
snow
this
climax
of
the
series
had
been
reached
on
the
aforesaid
moor
and
for
the
first
time
in
the
season
its
irregularities
were
forms
without
features
suggestive
of
anything
proclaiming
nothing
and
without
more
character
than
that
of
being
the
limit
of
something
lowest
layer
of
a
firmament
of
snow
from
this
chaotic
skyful
of
crowding
flakes

mead
and
moor

received
additional
clothing
only
to
appear
momentarily
more
naked
thereby
the
vast
arch
of
cloud
above
was
strangely
low
and
formed
as
it
were
the
roof
of
a
large
dark
cavern
gradually
sinking
in
upon
its
floor
for
the
instinctive
thought
was
that
the
snow
lining
the
heavens
and
that
encrusting
the
earth
would
soon
unite
into
one
mass
without
any
intervening
stratum
of
air
at
all
we
turn
our
attention
to
the
characteristics
which
were
flatness
in
respect
of
the
river
verticality
in
respect
of
the
wall
behind
it
and
darkness
as
to
both
these
features
made
up
the
mass
if
anything
could
be
darker
than
the
sky
it
was
the
wall
and
if
any
thing
could
be
gloomier
than
the
wall
it
was
the
river
beneath
the
indistinct
summit
of
the
façade
was
notched
and
pronged
by
chimneys
here
and
there
and
upon
its
face
were
faintly
signified
the
oblong
shapes
of
windows
though
only
in
the
upper
part
below
down
to
the
edge
the
flat
was
unbroken
by
hole
or
projection
an
indescribable
succession
of
dull
blows
perplexing
in
their
regularity
sent
their
sound
with
difficulty
through
the
fluffy
atmosphere
it
was
a
neighbouring
clock
striking
ten
the
bell
was
in
the
open
air
and
being
overlaid
with
several
inches
of
muffling
snow
had
lost
its
voice
for
the
time
about
this
hour
the
snow
abated
ten
flakes
fell
where
twenty
had
fallen
then
one
had
the
room
of
ten
not
long
after
a
form
moved
by
the
brink
of
the
river
by
its
outline
upon
the
colourless
background
a
close
observer
might
have
seen
that
it
was
small
this
was
all
that
was
positively
discoverable
though
it
seemed
human
the
shape
went
slowly
along
but
without
much
exertion
for
the
snow
though
sudden
was
not
as
yet
more
than
two
inches
deep
at
this
time
some
words
were
spoken
aloud
two
three
four
between
each
utterance
the
little
shape
advanced
about
half
a
dozen
yards
it
was
evident
now
that
the
windows
high
in
the
wall
were
being
counted
the
word
represented
the
fifth
window
from
the
end
of
the
wall
here
the
spot
stopped
and
dwindled
smaller
the
figure
was
stooping
then
a
morsel
of
snow
flew
across
the
river
towards
the
fifth
window
it
smacked
against
the
wall
at
a
point
several
yards
from
its
mark
the
throw
was
the
idea
of
a
man
conjoined
with
the
execution
of
a
woman
no
man
who
had
ever
seen
bird
rabbit
or
squirrel
in
his
childhood
could
possibly
have
thrown
with
such
utter
imbecility
as
was
shown
here
another
attempt
and
another
till
by
degrees
the
wall
must
have
become
pimpled
with
the
adhering
lumps
of
snow
at
last
one
fragment
struck
the
fifth
window
the
river
would
have
been
seen
by
day
to
be
of
that
deep
smooth
sort
which
races
middle
and
sides
with
the
same
gliding
precision
any
irregularities
of
speed
being
immediately
corrected
by
a
small
whirlpool
nothing
was
heard
in
reply
to
the
signal
but
the
gurgle
and
cluck
of
one
of
these
invisible
with
a
few
small
sounds
which
a
sad
man
would
have
called
moans
and
a
happy
man
by
the
flapping
of
the
waters
against
trifling
objects
in
other
parts
of
the
stream
the
window
was
struck
again
in
the
same
manner
then
a
noise
was
heard
apparently
produced
by
the
opening
of
the
window
this
was
followed
by
a
voice
from
the
same
quarter
there
the
tones
were
masculine
and
not
those
of
surprise
the
high
wall
being
that
of
a
barrack
and
marriage
being
looked
upon
with
disfavour
in
the
army
assignations
and
communications
had
probably
been
made
across
the
river
before
it
sergeant
troy
said
the
blurred
spot
in
the
snow
tremulously
this
person
was
so
much
like
a
mere
shade
upon
the
earth
and
the
other
speaker
so
much
a
part
of
the
building
that
one
would
have
said
the
wall
was
holding
a
conversation
with
the
snow
came
suspiciously
from
the
shadow
girl
are
you
you
know
me
said
the
spot
wife
fanny
said
the
wall
in
utter
astonishment
said
the
girl
with
a
gasp
of
emotion
there
was
something
in
the
tone
which
is
not
that
of
the
wife
and
there
was
a
manner
in
the
man
which
is
rarely
a
the
dialogue
went
on
did
you
come
here
asked
which
was
your
window
forgive
me
did
not
expect
you
indeed
i
did
not
think
you
would
come
at
all
it
was
a
wonder
you
found
me
here
i
am

said
i
was
to
said
that
you
i
mean
that
i
might
you
are
glad
to
see

have
no
leave

are
all
of
us
as
good
as
in
the
county
gaol
till
i
see
you
till
then
the
words
were
in
a
faltering
tone
of
disappointment
did
you
get
here
from
weatherbury
part
of
the
rest
by
the
am
am
i
and
frank
when
will
it
be
you
quite
you
do
speak
like
that
it
weighs
me
to
the
earth
it
makes
me
say
what
ought
to
be
said
first
by
must
i
is
when
shall
we
be
married

i
see
have
to
get

it
be

will
have

am
afraid

times

foolish
if

of
course

i
forgot
to
ask

so
sudden

to
worry

away

come
and

at

barracks

bad
women
about
and
they
think
me
so
come
to
you
my
dear
and
the
noise
was
again
heard
of
a
window
closing
the
little
spot
moved
away
when
she
passed
the
corner
a
subdued
exclamation
was
heard
inside
the
wall
an
expostulation
followed
but
it
was
indistinct
and
it
became
lost
amid
a
low
peal
of
laughter
which
was
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
gurgle
of
the
tiny
whirlpools
outside
chapter

exception
the
first
public
evidence
of
decision
to
be
a
farmer
in
her
own
person
and
by
proxy
no
more
was
her
appearance
the
following
in
the
cornmarket
at
casterbridge
the
low
though
extensive
hall
supported
by
beams
and
pillars
and
latterly
dignified
by
the
name
of
corn
exchange
was
thronged
with
hot
men
who
talked
among
each
other
in
twos
and
threes
the
speaker
of
the
minute
looking
sideways
into
his
face
and
concentrating
his
argument
by
a
contraction
of
one
eyelid
during
delivery
the
greater
number
carried
in
their
hands
saplings
using
them
partly
as
and
partly
for
poking
up
pigs
sheep
neighbours
with
their
backs
turned
and
restful
things
in
general
which
seemed
to
require
such
treatment
in
the
course
of
their
peregrinations
during
conversations
each
subjected
his
sapling
to
great
varieties
of
it
round
his
back
forming
an
arch
of
it
between
his
two
hands
overweighting
it
on
the
ground
till
it
reached
nearly
a
semicircle
or
perhaps
it
was
hastily
tucked
under
the
arm
whilst
the
was
pulled
forth
and
a
handful
of
corn
poured
into
the
palm
which
after
criticism
was
flung
upon
the
floor
an
issue
of
events
perfectly
well
known
to
acute
fowls
which
had
as
usual
crept
into
the
building
unobserved
and
waited
the
fulfilment
of
their
anticipations
with
a
neck
and
oblique
eye
among
these
heavy
yeomen
a
feminine
figure
glided
the
single
one
of
her
sex
that
the
room
contained
she
was
prettily
and
even
daintily
dressed
she
moved
between
them
as
a
chaise
between
carts
was
heard
after
them
as
a
romance
after
sermons
was
felt
among
them
like
a
breeze
among
furnaces
it
had
required
a
little
more
than
she
had
at
first
take
up
a
position
here
for
at
her
first
entry
the
lumbering
dialogues
had
ceased
nearly
every
face
had
been
turned
towards
her
and
those
that
were
already
turned
rigidly
fixed
there
two
or
three
only
of
the
farmers
were
personally
known
to
bathsheba
and
to
these
she
had
made
her
way
but
if
she
was
to
be
the
practical
woman
she
had
intended
to
show
herself
business
must
be
carried
on
introductions
or
none
and
she
ultimately
acquired
confidence
enough
to
speak
and
reply
boldly
to
men
merely
known
to
her
by
hearsay
bathsheba
too
had
her
and
by
degrees
adopted
the
professional
pour
into
the
up
the
grains
in
her
narrow
palm
for
inspection
in
perfect
casterbridge
manner
something
in
the
exact
arch
of
her
upper
unbroken
row
of
teeth
and
in
the
keenly
pointed
corners
of
her
red
mouth
when
with
parted
lips
she
somewhat
defiantly
turned
up
her
face
to
argue
a
point
with
a
tall
man
suggested
that
there
was
potentiality
enough
in
that
lithe
slip
of
humanity
for
alarming
exploits
of
sex
and
daring
enough
to
carry
them
out
but
her
eyes
had
a
a
had
they
not
been
dark
would
have
seemed
mistiness
as
they
were
it
lowered
an
expression
that
might
have
been
piercing
to
simple
clearness
strange
to
say
of
a
woman
in
full
bloom
and
vigor
she
always
allowed
her
interlocutors
to
finish
their
statements
before
rejoining
with
hers
in
arguing
on
prices
she
held
to
her
own
firmly
as
was
natural
in
a
dealer
and
reduced
theirs
persistently
as
was
inevitable
in
a
woman
but
there
was
an
elasticity
in
her
firmness
which
removed
it
from
obstinacy
as
there
was
a
in
her
cheapening
which
saved
it
from
meanness
those
of
the
farmers
with
whom
she
had
no
dealings
by
far
the
greater
part
were
continually
asking
each
other
is
she
the
reply
would
niece
took
on
weatherbury
upper
farm
turned
away
the
baily
and
swears
do
everything
the
other
man
would
then
shake
his
head
a
pity
so
headstrong
the
first
would
say
we
ought
to
be
proud
of
her
lightens
up
the
old
place
such
a
shapely
maid
however
that
soon
get
picked
it
would
be
ungallant
to
suggest
that
the
novelty
of
her
engagement
in
such
an
occupation
had
almost
as
much
to
do
with
the
magnetism
as
had
the
beauty
of
her
face
and
movements
however
the
interest
was
general
and
this
in
the
forum
whatever
it
may
have
been
to
bathsheba
as
the
buying
and
selling
farmer
was
unquestionably
a
triumph
to
her
as
the
maiden
indeed
the
sensation
was
so
pronounced
that
her
instinct
on
two
or
three
occasions
was
merely
to
walk
as
a
queen
among
these
gods
of
the
fallow
like
a
little
sister
of
a
little
jove
and
to
neglect
closing
prices
altogether
the
numerous
evidences
of
her
power
to
attract
were
only
thrown
into
greater
relief
by
a
marked
exception
women
seem
to
have
eyes
in
their
ribbons
for
such
matters
as
these
bathsheba
without
looking
within
a
right
angle
of
him
was
conscious
of
a
black
sheep
among
the
flock
it
perplexed
her
first
if
there
had
been
a
respectable
minority
on
either
side
the
case
would
have
been
most
natural
if
nobody
had
regarded
her
she
would
have
taken
the
matter
cases
had
occurred
if
everybody
this
man
included
she
would
have
taken
it
as
a
matter
of
had
done
so
before
but
the
smallness
of
the
exception
made
the
mystery
she
soon
knew
thus
much
of
the
appearance
he
was
a
gentlemanly
man
with
full
and
distinctly
outlined
roman
features
the
prominences
of
which
glowed
in
the
sun
with
a
richness
of
tone
he
was
erect
in
attitude
and
quiet
in
demeanour
one
characteristic
marked
apparently
he
had
some
time
ago
reached
that
entrance
to
middle
age
at
which
a
aspect
naturally
ceases
to
alter
for
the
term
of
a
dozen
years
or
so
and
artificially
a
does
likewise
and
fifty
were
his
limits
of
might
have
been
either
or
anywhere
between
the
two
it
may
be
said
that
married
men
of
forty
are
usually
ready
and
generous
enough
to
fling
passing
glances
at
any
specimen
of
moderate
beauty
they
may
discern
by
the
way
probably
as
with
persons
playing
whist
for
love
the
consciousness
of
a
certain
immunity
under
any
circumstances
from
that
worst
possible
ultimate
the
having
to
pay
makes
them
unduly
speculative
bathsheba
was
convinced
that
this
unmoved
person
was
not
a
married
man
when
marketing
was
over
she
rushed
off
to
liddy
who
was
waiting
for
her
beside
the
yellow
gig
in
which
they
had
driven
to
town
the
horse
was
put
in
and
on
they
sugar
tea
and
drapery
parcels
being
packed
behind
and
expressing
in
some
indescribable
manner
by
their
colour
shape
and
general
lineaments
that
they
were
that
young
property
and
the
and
no
more
been
through
it
liddy
and
it
is
over
i
mind
it
again
for
they
will
all
have
grown
accustomed
to
seeing
me
there
but
this
morning
it
was
as
bad
as
being
everywhere
knowed
it
would
be
liddy
said
be
such
a
terrible
class
of
society
to
look
at
a
there
was
one
man
who
had
more
sense
than
to
waste
his
time
upon
the
information
was
put
in
this
form
that
liddy
might
not
for
a
moment
suppose
her
mistress
was
at
all
piqued
very
man
she
continued
about
forty
i
should
think
do
you
know
at
all
who
he
could
be
liddy
think
you
guess
at
all
said
bathsheba
with
some
disappointment
a
notion
besides
no
difference
since
he
took
less
notice
of
you
than
any
of
the
rest
now
if
taken
more
it
would
have
mattered
a
great
bathsheba
was
suffering
from
the
reverse
feeling
just
then
and
they
bowled
along
in
silence
a
low
carriage
bowling
along
still
more
rapidly
behind
a
horse
of
unimpeachable
breed
overtook
and
passed
them
there
he
is
she
said
liddy
looked
farmer
course
man
you
see
the
other
day
when
he
farmer
boldwood
murmured
bathsheba
and
looked
at
him
as
he
outstripped
them
the
farmer
had
never
turned
his
head
once
but
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
most
advanced
point
along
the
road
passed
as
unconsciously
and
abstractedly
as
if
bathsheba
and
her
charms
were
thin
air
an
interesting
you
think
so
she
remarked
yes
very
everybody
owns
it
replied
liddy
wonder
why
he
is
so
wrapt
up
and
indifferent
and
seemingly
so
far
away
from
all
he
sees
around
is
not
known
for
he
met
with
some
bitter
disappointment
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
merry
a
woman
jilted
him
they
always
say
we
know
very
well
women
scarcely
ever
jilt
men
the
men
who
jilt
us
i
expect
it
is
simply
his
nature
to
be
so
his
expect
so
else
in
the
more
romantic
to
think
he
has
been
served
cruelly
poor
perhaps
after
all
he
has
upon
it
he
has
oh
yes
miss
he
has
i
feel
he
must
we
are
very
apt
to
think
extremes
of
people
i
wonder
after
all
if
it
a
little
of
between
the
cruelly
used
and
rather
dear
no
think
it
between
the
two
most
yes
so
it
is
i
am
convinced
it
is
most
likely
you
may
take
my
word
miss
that
the
matter
with
chapter
xiii
sortes
valentine
it
was
sunday
afternoon
in
the
farmhouse
on
the
thirteenth
of
february
dinner
being
over
bathsheba
for
want
of
a
better
companion
had
asked
liddy
to
come
and
sit
with
her
the
mouldy
pile
was
dreary
in
before
the
candles
were
lighted
and
the
shutters
closed
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
seemed
as
old
as
the
walls
every
nook
behind
the
furniture
had
a
temperature
of
its
own
for
the
fire
was
not
kindled
in
this
part
of
the
house

particularly
sloping

on
the

threw
a
shade
over
its
less
prominent
angles
and
hid
the
unpleasantness
liddy
like
a
little
brook
though
shallow
was
always
rippling
her
presence
had
not
so
much
weight
as
to
task
thought
and
yet
enough
to
exercise
it
on
the
table
lay
an
old
quarto

bound
in

looking
at
it

you

said
bathsheba
bounding
from
her
seat
with
that
total
disregard
of
consistency
which
can
be
indulged
in
towards
a
dependent
and

said

returning

replied
her
mistress
in
a
tone
which
was
a
proof
in
itself
the
book
was
leaves
drab
with
age
being
quite
worn
away
at
verses
by
the
forefingers
of
unpractised
readers
in
former
days
where
they
were
moved
along
under
the
line
as
an
aid
to
the
vision
the
special
verse
in
the
book
of
ruth
was
sought
out
by
bathsheba
and
the
sublime
words
met
her
eye
they
slightly
thrilled
and
abashed
her
it
was
wisdom
in
the
abstract
facing
folly
in
the
concrete
folly
in
the
concrete
blushed
persisted
in
her
intention
and
placed
the
key
on
the
book
a
rusty
patch
immediately
upon
the
verse
caused
by
previous
pressure
of
an
iron
substance
thereon
told
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
the
old
volume
had
been
used
for
the
purpose
keep
steady
and
be
silent
said
bathsheba
the
verse
was
repeated
the
book
turned
round
bathsheba
blushed
guiltily
did
you
try
said
liddy
curiously
shall
not
tell
you
notice
doings
in
church
this
morning
miss
liddy
continued
adumbrating
by
the
remark
the
track
her
thoughts
had
taken
indeed
said
bathsheba
with
serene
indifference
pew
is
exactly
opposite
yours

you
did
not
see
his
goings
on
i
did
not
i
tell
liddy
assumed
a
smaller
physiognomy
and
shut
her
lips
decisively
this
move
was
unexpected
and
proportionately
disconcerting
did
he
do
bathsheba
said
perforce
turn
his
head
to
look
at
you
once
all
the
should
he
again
demanded
her
mistress
wearing
a
nettled
look
ask
him
no
but
everybody
else
was
noticing
you
and
it
was
odd
he
there
like
him
rich
and
gentlemanly
what
does
he
care
bathsheba
dropped
into
a
silence
intended
to
express
that
she
had
opinions
on
the
matter
too
abstruse
for
comprehension
rather
than
that
she
had
nothing
to
say
had
nearly
forgotten
the
valentine
i
bought
yesterday
she
exclaimed
at
length
who
for
miss
said
liddy
boldwood
it
was
the
single
name
among
all
possible
wrong
ones
that
just
at
this
moment
seemed
to
bathsheba
more
pertinent
than
the
right
no
it
is
only
for
little
teddy
coggan
i
have
promised
him
something
and
this
will
be
a
pretty
surprise
for
him
liddy
you
may
as
well
bring
me
my
desk
and
direct
it
at
bathsheba
took
from
her
desk
a
gorgeously
illuminated
and
embossed
design
in
which
had
been
bought
on
the
previous
at
the
chief
in
casterbridge
in
the
centre
was
a
small
oval
enclosure
this
was
left
blank
that
the
sender
might
insert
tender
words
more
appropriate
to
the
special
occasion
than
any
generalities
by
a
printer
could
possibly
be
a
place
for
writing
said
bathsheba
shall
i
put
of
this
sort
i
should
think
returned
liddy
promptly
rose

and
so
are
that
shall
be
it
it
just
suits
itself
to
a
child
like
him
said
bathsheba
she
inserted
the
words
in
a
small
though
legible
handwriting
enclosed
the
sheet
in
an
envelope
and
dipped
her
pen
for
the
direction
fun
it
would
be
to
send
it
to
the
stupid
old
boldwood
and
how
he
would
wonder
said
the
irrepressible
liddy
lifting
her
eyebrows
and
indulging
in
an
awful
mirth
on
the
verge
of
fear
as
she
thought
of
the
moral
and
social
magnitude
of
the
man
contemplated
bathsheba
paused
to
regard
the
idea
at
full
length
had
begun
to
be
a
troublesome
species
of
daniel
in
her
kingdom
who
persisted
in
kneeling
eastward
when
reason
and
common
sense
said
that
he
might
just
as
well
follow
suit
with
the
rest
and
afford
her
the
official
glance
of
admiration
which
cost
nothing
at
all
she
was
far
from
being
seriously
concerned
about
his
nonconformity
still
it
was
faintly
depressing
that
the
most
dignified
and
valuable
man
in
the
parish
should
withhold
his
eyes
and
that
a
girl
like
liddy
should
talk
about
it
so
idea
was
at
first
rather
harassing
than
piquant
i
do
that
he
see
any
humour
in
worry
to
death
said
the
persistent
liddy
i

particularly
to
send
it

her
mistress

no

open
the
book
went
fluttering
in
the
air
and
came
down

bathsheba
a
small
yawn
upon
her
mouth
took
the
pen
and
with
serenity
directed
the
missive
to
boldwood

bathsheba
looked
closely
at

hot

discover
the

exclaimed
throwing
down
the
letter
frolicsomely
upset
the
solemnity
of
a

liddy
looked
at
the
words
of
the

and
the

evening
the
letter
was
sent
and
was
duly
sorted
in
casterbridge
that
night
to
be
returned
to
weatherbury
again
in
the
morning
so
very
idly
and
unreflectingly
was
this
deed
done

effect
of
the
at
dusk
on
the
evening
of
day
boldwood
sat
down
to
supper
as
usual
by
a
beaming
fire
of
aged
logs
upon
the
before
him
was
a
surmounted
by
a
spread
eagle
and
upon
the
wings
was
the
letter
bathsheba
had
sent
here
the
gaze
was
continually
fastening
itself
till
the
large
red
seal
became
as
a
blot
of
blood
on
the
retina
of
his
eye
and
as
he
ate
and
drank
he
still
read
in
fancy
the
words
thereon
although
they
were
too
remote
for
his
the
pert
injunction
was
like
those
crystal
substances
which
colourless
themselves
assume
the
tone
of
objects
about
them
here
in
the
quiet
of
parlour
where
everything
that
was
not
grave
was
extraneous
and
where
the
atmosphere
was
that
of
a
puritan
sunday
lasting
all
the
week
the
letter
and
its
dictum
changed
their
tenor
from
the
thoughtlessness
of
their
origin
to
a
deep
solemnity
imbibed
from
their
accessories
now
since
the
receipt
of
the
missive
in
the
morning
boldwood
had
felt
the
symmetry
of
his
existence
to
be
slowly
getting
distorted
in
the
direction
of
an
ideal
passion
the
disturbance
was
as
the
first
floating
weed
to
contemptibly
little
suggesting
possibilities
of
the
infinitely
great
the
letter
must
have
had
an
origin
and
a
motive
that
the
latter
was
of
the
smallest
magnitude
compatible
with
its
existence
at
all
boldwood
of
course
did
not
know
and
such
an
explanation
did
not
strike
him
as
a
possibility
even
it
is
foreign
to
a
mystified
condition
of
mind
to
realize
of
the
mystifier
that
the
processes
of
approving
a
course
suggested
by
circumstance
and
of
striking
out
a
course
from
inner
impulse
would
look
the
same
in
the
result
the
vast
difference
between
starting
a
train
of
events
and
directing
into
a
particular
groove
a
series
already
started
is
rarely
apparent
to
the
person
confounded
by
the
issue
when
boldwood
went
to
bed
he
placed
the
valentine
in
the
corner
of
the
he
was
conscious
of
its
presence
even
when
his
back
was
turned
upon
it
it
was
the
first
time
in
life
that
such
an
event
had
occurred
the
same
fascination
that
caused
him
to
think
it
an
act
which
had
a
deliberate
motive
prevented
him
from
regarding
it
as
an
impertinence
he
looked
again
at
the
direction
the
mysterious
influences
of
night
invested
the
writing
with
the
presence
of
the
unknown
writer
had
travelled
softly
over
the
paper
bearing
his
name
her
unrevealed
eyes
had
watched
every
curve
as
she
formed
it
her
brain
had
seen
him
in
imagination
the
while
why
should
she
have
imagined
him
her
the
lips
red
or
pale
plump
or
creased
curved
itself
to
a
certain
expression
as
the
pen
went
corners
had
moved
with
all
their
natural
tremulousness
what
had
been
the
expression
the
vision
of
the
woman
writing
as
a
supplement
to
the
words
written
had
no
individuality
she
was
a
misty
shape
and
well
she
might
be
considering
that
her
original
was
at
that
moment
sound
asleep
and
oblivious
of
all
love
and
under
the
sky
whenever
boldwood
dozed
she
took
a
form
and
comparatively
ceased
to
be
a
vision
when
he
awoke
there
was
the
letter
justifying
the
dream
the
moon
shone
and
its
light
was
not
of
a
customary
kind
his
window
admitted
only
a
reflection
of
its
rays
and
the
pale
sheen
had
that
reversed
direction
which
snow
gives
coming
upward
and
lighting
up
his
ceiling
in
an
unnatural
way
casting
shadows
in
strange
places
and
putting
lights
where
shadows
had
used
to
be
the
substance
of
the
epistle
had
occupied
him
but
little
in
comparison
with
the
fact
of
its
arrival
he
suddenly
wondered
if
anything
more
might
be
found
in
the
envelope
than
what
he
had
withdrawn
he
jumped
out
of
bed
in
the
weird
light
took
the
letter
pulled
out
the
flimsy
sheet
shook
the
it
nothing
more
was
there
boldwood
looked
as
he
had
a
hundred
times
the
preceding
day
at
the
insistent
red
seal
me
he
said
aloud
the
solemn
and
reserved
yeoman
again
closed
the
letter
and
stuck
it
in
the
frame
of
the
glass
in
doing
so
he
caught
sight
of
his
reflected
features
wan
in
expression
and
insubstantial
in
form
he
saw
how
closely
compressed
was
his
mouth
and
that
his
eyes
were
and
vacant
feeling
uneasy
and
dissatisfied
with
himself
for
this
nervous
excitability
he
returned
to
bed
then
the
dawn
drew
on
the
full
power
of
the
clear
heaven
was
not
equal
to
that
of
a
cloudy
sky
at
noon
when
boldwood
arose
and
dressed
himself
he
descended
the
stairs
and
went
out
towards
the
gate
of
a
field
to
the
east
leaning
over
which
he
paused
and
looked
around
it
was
one
of
the
usual
slow
sunrises
of
this
time
of
the
year
and
the
sky
pure
violet
in
the
zenith
was
leaden
to
the
northward
and
murky
to
the
east
where
over
the
snowy
down
or
on
weatherbury
upper
farm
and
apparently
resting
upon
the
ridge
the
only
half
of
the
sun
yet
visible
burnt
rayless
like
a
red
and
flameless
fire
shining
over
a
white
hearthstone
the
whole
effect
resembled
a
sunset
as
childhood
resembles
age
in
other
directions
the
fields
and
sky
were
so
much
of
one
colour
by
the
snow
that
it
was
difficult
in
a
hasty
glance
to
tell
whereabouts
the
horizon
occurred
and
in
general
there
was
here
too
that
preternatural
inversion
of
light
and
shade
which
attends
the
prospect
when
the
garish
brightness
commonly
in
the
sky
is
found
on
the
earth
and
the
shades
of
earth
are
in
the
sky
over
the
west
hung
the
wasting
moon
now
dull
and
like
tarnished
brass
boldwood
was
listlessly
noting
how
the
frost
had
hardened
and
glazed
the
surface
of
the
snow
till
it
shone
in
the
red
eastern
light
with
the
polish
of
marble
how
in
some
portions
of
the
slope
withered
encased
in
icicles
bristled
through
the
smooth
wan
coverlet
in
the
twisted
and
curved
shapes
of
old
venetian
glass
and
how
the
footprints
of
a
few
birds
which
had
hopped
over
the
snow
whilst
it
lay
in
the
state
of
a
soft
fleece
were
now
frozen
to
a
short
permanency
a
noise
of
light
wheels
interrupted
him
boldwood
turned
back
into
the
road
it
was
the
crazy
vehicle
hardly
heavy
enough
to
resist
a
puff
of
wind
the
driver
held
out
a
letter
boldwood
seized
it
and
opened
it
expecting
another
anonymous
greatly
are
ideas
of
probability
a
mere
sense
that
precedent
will
repeat
itself
think
it
is
for
you
sir
said
the
man
when
he
saw
action
there
is

i

it
is

your

looked
then
at
the

the
new
shepherd

near
casterbridge
a
mistake
is
not
mine
nor
is
it
for
my

it
is
for
miss
you
had
better
take
it
on
to
say
i
opened
it
in
at
this
moment
on
the
ridge
up
against
the
blazing
sky
a
figure
was
visible
like
the
black
snuff
in
the
midst
of
a
then
it
moved
and
began
to
bustle
about
vigorously
from
place
to
place
carrying
square
skeleton
masses
which
were
riddled
by
the
same
rays
a
small
figure
on
all
fours
followed
behind
the
tall
form
was
that
of
gabriel

small

that

the

in

of
transit
were

said
boldwood
the

take
the
letter
to
him
to
boldwood
it
was
now
no
longer
merely
a
letter
to
another
man
it
was
an
opportunity
exhibiting
a
face
pregnant
with
intention
he
entered
the
snowy
field
gabriel
at
that
minute
descended
the

towards
the
right
the

stretched
down
in
this
direction
now
and
touched

the

outside
the

did
not
penetrate
to
its
interior
which
was
as
usual
lighted
by
a
rival
glow
of
similar
hue
radiating
from
the
hearth
the
maltster
after
having
lain
down
in
his
clothes
for
a
few
hours
was
now
sitting
beside
a
table
breakfasting
off
bread
and
bacon
this
was
eaten
on
the
plateless
system
which
is
performed
by
placing
a
slice
of
bread
upon
the
table
the
meat
flat
upon
the
bread
a

not

sensibly
diminish
his

he
had
been
without
them
for
so
many
years
that
toothlessness
was
felt
less
to
be
a
defect
than
hard

an
acquisition
indeed
he
seemed
to
approach
the
grave
as
a
hyperbolic
curve
approaches
a

spreading
into

to
be
at
all
an
abrupt
beginning
to
the
maltster
introductory
matter
being
often
omitted
in
this
neighbourhood
both
from
word
and
deed
and
the
maltster
having
the
same
latitude
allowed
him
did
not
hurry
to
reply
he
picked
up
a
fragment
of
cheese
by
pecking
upon
it
with
his
knife
as
a
butcher
picks
up
skewers
henery
appeared
in
a
drab
kerseymere
buttoned
over
his
the
white
skirts
of
the
latter
being
visible
to
the
distance
of
about
a
foot
below
the
which
when
you
got
used
to
the
style
of
dress
looked
natural
enough
and
even
certainly
was
comfortable
matthew
moon
joseph
poorgrass
and
other
carters
and
waggoners
followed
at
his
heels
with
great
lanterns
dangling
from
their
hands
which
showed
that
they
had
just
come
from
the
stables
where
they
had
been
busily
engaged
since
four
that
morning
how
is
she
getting
on
without
a
baily
the
maltster
inquired
henery
shook
his
head
and
smiled
one
of
the
bitter
smiles
dragging
all
the
flesh
of
his
forehead
into
a
corrugated
heap
in
the
centre
rue
surely
he
said
pennyways
were
not
a
true
man
or
an
honest
big
a
betrayer
as
judas
iscariot
himself
but
to
think
she
can
on
alone
he
allowed
his
head
to
swing
laterally
three
or
four
times
in
silence
in
all
my
creeping
this
was
recognized
by
all
as
the
conclusion
of
some
gloomy
speech
which
had
been
expressed
in
thought
alone
during
the
shake
of
the
head
henery
meanwhile
retained
several
marks
of
despair
upon
his
face
to
imply
that
they
would
be
required
for
use
again
directly
he
should
go
on
speaking
will
be
ruined
and
ourselves
too
or
no
meat

with
a
smile
of
misery

to

attested
joseph

a
short
pause
ensued
and
as
a
sort
of
henery
turned
and
blew
out
the
lanterns
which
the
increase
of
daylight
rendered
no
longer
necessary
even
in
the
malthouse

said
the

the

flung
back
till
it
kicked
the

and
trembled
from

with
the
blow
oak
appeared
in
the
entry
with
a
steaming
face
wound
about
his
ankles
to
keep
out
the
snow
a
leather
strap
round
his
waist
outside

looking
altogether
an
epitome
of
the
health
and
vigour
four
lambs
hung
in
various
embarrassing
attitudes
over
his
shoulders
and
the

contrived
to

and
retired
as
he
was
bidden
oak
lowered
the
lambs
from
their
unnatural
elevation
wrapped
them
in
hay
and
placed
them
round
the
fire
no
here
as
i
used
to
have
at
norcombe
said
gabriel
such
a
plague
to
bring
the
weakly
ones
to
a
house
if
for
your
place
here

i
know
what
i

how

it
with
you

neither
sick
nor
sorry
shepherd
but
no
down
shepherd
oak
continued
the
ancient
man
of
malt
how
was
the
old
place
at
norcombe
when
ye
went
for
your
dog
i
should
like
to
see
the
old
familiar
spot
but
faith
i
know
a
soul
there
suppose
you
altered
very
it
true
that
dicky
wooden
is
pulled
down
ago
and
cottage
just
above
to
be
sure
and
old
is
rooted
that
used
to
bear
two
hogsheads
of
cider
and
no
help
from
other
say
it
ah
stirring
times
we
live
you
can
mind
the
old
well
that
used
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
place
turned
into
a
solid
iron
pump
with
a
large
stone
trough
and
all
the
face
of
nations
alter
and
what
we
live
to
see
nowadays
the
same
here
been
talking
but
now
of
the
strange
have
you
been
saying
about
her
inquired
oak
sharply
turning
to
the
rest
and
getting
very
warm
men
have
been
pulling
her
over
the
coals
for
pride
and
vanity
said
mark
clark
i
say
let
her
have
rope
enough
bless
her
pretty
i
like
to
do
her
cherry
lips
the
gallant
mark
clark
here
made
a
peculiar
and
well
known
sound
with
his
own
said
gabriel
sternly
you
mind
this
none
of
that
style
of
miss
everdene
i
allow
it
do
you
hear
all
my
heart
as
got
no
chance
replied
clark
cordially
suppose
been
speaking
against
her
said
oak
turning
to
joseph
poorgrass
with
a
very
grim
look
a
word
a
real
joyful
thing
that
no
worse
what
i
say
said
joseph
trembling
and
blushing
with
terror
just
moon
what
have
you
been
saying
asked
oak
why
ye
know
i
harm
a
not
one
underground
worm
said
matthew
moon
looking
very
uneasy
somebody
look
here
neighbours
gabriel
though
one
of
the
quietest
and
most
gentle
men
on
earth
rose
to
the
occasion
with
martial
promptness
and
vigour
my
here
he
placed
his
fist
rather
smaller
in
size
than
a
common
loaf
in
the
mathematical
centre
of
the
little
table
and
with
it
gave
a
bump
or
two
thereon
as
if
to
ensure
that
their
eyes
all
thoroughly
took
in
the
idea
of
fistiness
before
he
went
further
first
man
in
the
parish
that
i
hear
prophesying
bad
of
our
mistress
here
the
fist
was
raised
and
let
fall
as
thor
might
have
done
with
his
hammer
in
assaying
it
smell
and
taste
a
all
earnestly
expressed
by
their
features
that
their
minds
did
not
wander
to
holland
for
a
moment
on
account
of
this
statement
but
were
deploring
the
difference
which
gave
rise
to
the
figure
and
mark
clark
cried
hear
just
what
i
should
the
dog
george
looked
up
at
the
same
time
after
the
menace
and
though
he
understood
english
but
imperfectly
began
to
growl
ye
take
on
so
shepherd
and
sit
down
said
henery
with
a
deprecating
peacefulness
equal
to
anything
of
the
kind
in
christianity
hear
that
ye
be
a
extraordinary
good
and
clever
man
shepherd
said
joseph
poorgrass
with
considerable
anxiety
from
behind
the
bedstead
whither
he
had
retired
for
safety
a
great
thing
to
be
clever
sure
he
added
making
movements
associated
with
states
of
mind
rather
than
body
wish
we
were
we
neighbours
that
we
do
sure
said
matthew
moon
with
a
small
anxious
laugh
towards
oak
to
show
how
very
friendly
disposed
he
was
likewise
been
telling
you
clever
said
oak
blowed
about
from
pillar
to
post
quite
common
said
matthew
hear
that
ye
can
tell
the
time
as
well
by
the
stars
as
we
can
by
the
sun
and
moon
i
can
do
a
little
that
way
said
gabriel
as
a
man
of
medium
sentiments
on
the
subject
that
ye
can
make
and
prent
names
upon
their
waggons
almost
like
with
beautiful
flourishes
and
great
long
tails
a
excellent
fine
thing
for
ye
to
be
such
a
clever
man
shepherd
joseph
poorgrass
used
to
prent
to
farmer
james
waggons
before
you
came
and
could
never
mind
which
way
to
turn
the
and
ye
joseph
joseph
shook
his
head
to
express
how
absolute
was
the
fact
that
he
so
you
used
to
do
the
wrong
way
like
this
ye
joseph
matthew
marked
on
the
dusty
floor
with
his
illustration
the
word
j
a
m
e
s
appears
here
with
the
and
printed
backwards
how
farmer
james
would
cuss
and
call
thee
a
fool
he
joseph
when
seed
his
name
looking
so
continued
matthew
moon
with
feeling
would
said
joseph
meekly
you
see
i
so
much
to
blame
for
them
and
be
such
trying
sons
witches
for
the
memory
to
mind
whether
they
face
backward
or
forward
and
i
always
had
such
a
forgetful
memory
a
very
bad
affliction
for
ye
being
such
a
man
of
calamities
in
other
but
a
happy
providence
ordered
that
it
should
be
no
worse
and
i
feel
my
thanks
as
to
shepherd
there
sure
ought
to
have
made
ye
her
a
fitting
man
as
you
mind
owning
that
i
expected
it
said
oak
frankly
i
hoped
for
the
place
at
the
same
time
miss
everdene
has
a
right
to
be
her
own
baily
if
she
to
keep
me
down
to
be
a
common
shepherd
oak
drew
a
slow
breath
looked
sadly
into
the
bright
ashpit
and
seemed
lost
in
thoughts
not
of
the
most
hopeful
hue
the
genial
warmth
of
the
fire
now
began
to
stimulate
the
nearly
lifeless
lambs
to
bleat
and
move
their
limbs
briskly
upon
the
hay
and
to
recognize
for
the
first
time
the
fact
that
they
were
born
their
noise
increased
to
a
chorus
of
baas
upon
which
oak
pulled
the
from
before
the
fire
and
taking
a
small
from
the
pocket
of
his
filled
it
with
milk
and
taught
those
of
the
helpless
creatures
which
were
not
to
be
restored
to
their
dams
how
to
drink
from
the
trick
they
acquired
with
astonishing
aptitude
she
even
let
ye
have
the
skins
of
the
dead
lambs
i
hear
resumed
joseph
poorgrass
his
eyes
lingering
on
the
operations
of
oak
with
the
necessary
melancholy
have
them
said
gabriel
be
very
badly
used
shepherd
hazarded
joseph
again
in
the
hope
of
getting
oak
as
an
ally
in
lamentation
after
all
think
took
against
i
at
all
replied
gabriel
hastily
and
a
sigh
escaped
him
which
the
deprivation
of
lamb
skins
could
hardly
have
caused
before
any
further
remark
had
been
added
a
shade
darkened
the
door
and
boldwood
entered
the
malthouse
bestowing
upon
each
a
nod
of
a
quality
between
friendliness
and
condescension
oak
i
thought
you
were
here
he
said
met
the
ten
minutes
ago
and
a
letter
was
put
into
my
hand
which
i
opened
without
reading
the
address
i
believe
it
is
yours
you
must
excuse
the
accident
a
bit
of
difference
a
bit
said
gabriel
readily
he
had
not
a
correspondent
on
earth
nor
was
there
a
possible
letter
coming
to
him
whose
contents
the
whole
parish
would
not
have
been
welcome
to
peruse
oak
stepped
aside
and
read
the
following
in
an
unknown
hand
dear
friend
do
not
know
your
name
but
i
think
these
few
lines
will
reach
you
which
i
wrote
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
to
me
the
night
i
left
weatherbury
in
a
reckless
way
i
also
return
the
money
i
owe
you
which
you
will
excuse
my
not
keeping
as
a
gift
all
has
ended
well
and
i
am
happy
to
say
i
am
going
to
be
married
to
the
young
man
who
has
courted
me
for
some
troy
of
the
dragoon
guards
now
quartered
in
this
town
he
would
i
know
object
to
my
having
received
anything
except
as
a
loan
being
a
man
of
great
respectability
and
high
a
nobleman
by
blood
i
should
be
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
would
keep
the
contents
of
this
letter
a
secret
for
the
present
dear
friend
we
mean
to
surprise
weatherbury
by
coming
there
soon
as
husband
and
wife
though
i
blush
to
state
it
to
one
nearly
a
stranger
the
sergeant
grew
up
in
weatherbury
thanking
you
again
for
your
kindness
i
am
your
sincere
fanny
robin
you
read
it
boldwood
said
gabriel
not
you
had
better
do
so
i
know
you
are
interested
in
fanny
boldwood
read
the
letter
and
looked
grieved
fanny
the
end
she
is
so
confident
of
has
not
yet
come
she
should
may
never
come
i
see
she
gives
no
sort
of
a
man
is
this
sergeant
troy
said
gabriel
afraid
not
one
to
build
much
hope
upon
in
such
a
case
as
this
the
farmer
murmured
a
clever
fellow
and
up
to
everything
a
slight
romance
attaches
to
him
too
his
mother
was
a
french
governess
and
it
seems
that
a
secret
attachment
existed
between
her
and
the
late
lord
severn
she
was
married
to
a
poor
medical
man
and
soon
after
an
infant
was
born
and
while
money
was
forthcoming
all
went
on
well
unfortunately
for
her
boy
his
best
friends
died
and
he
got
then
a
situation
as
second
clerk
at
a
in
casterbridge
he
stayed
there
for
some
time
and
might
have
worked
himself
into
a
dignified
position
of
some
sort
had
he
not
indulged
in
the
wild
freak
of
enlisting
i
have
much
doubt
if
ever
little
fanny
will
surprise
us
in
the
way
she
much
doubt
a
silly
girl
girl
the
door
was
hurriedly
burst
open
again
and
in
came
running
cainy
ball
out
of
breath
his
mouth
red
and
open
like
the
bell
of
a
penny
trumpet
from
which
he
coughed
with
noisy
vigour
and
great
distension
of
face
cain
ball
said
oak
sternly
will
you
run
so
fast
and
lose
your
breath
so
always
telling
you
of
puff
of
mee
way
please
mister
oak
and
made
me
have
you
come
for
run
to
tell
ye
said
the
junior
shepherd
supporting
his
exhausted
youthful
frame
against
the
doorpost
you
must
come
directly
two
more
ewes
have
the
matter
shepherd
it
said
oak
jumping
up
and
dimissing
for
the
present
his
thoughts
on
poor
fanny
are
a
good
boy
to
run
and
tell
me
cain
and
you
shall
smell
a
large
plum
pudding
some
day
as
a
treat
but
before
we
go
cainy
bring
the
tarpot
and
mark
this
lot
and
have
done
with
oak
took
from
his
illimitable
pockets
a
marking
iron
dipped
it
into
the
pot
and
imprinted
on
the
buttocks
of
the
infant
sheep
the
initials
of
her
he
delighted
to
muse
which
signified
to
all
the
region
round
that
henceforth
the
lambs
belonged
to
farmer
bathsheba
everdene
and
to
no
one
else
cainy
shoulder
your
two
and
off
good
morning
the
shepherd
lifted
the
sixteen
large
legs
and
four
small
bodies
he
had
himself
brought
and
vanished
with
them
in
the
direction
of
the
lambing
field
hard
frames
being
now
in
a
sleek
and
hopeful
state
pleasantly
contrasting
with
their
plight
of
half
an
hour
before
boldwood
followed
him
a
little
way
up
the
field
hesitated
and
turned
back
he
followed
him
again
with
a
last
resolve
annihilating
return
on
approaching
the
nook
in
which
the
fold
was
constructed
the
farmer
drew
out
his
unfastened
it
and
allowed
it
to
lie
open
on
his
hand
a
letter
was
was
going
to
ask
you
oak
he
said
with
unreal
carelessness
you
know
whose
writing
this
is
oak
glanced
into
the
book
and
replied
instantly
with
a
flushed
face
oak
had
coloured
simply
at
the
consciousness
of
sounding
her
name
he
now
felt
a
strangely
distressing
qualm
from
a
new
thought
the
letter
could
of
course
be
no
other
than
anonymous
or
the
inquiry
would
not
have
been
necessary
boldwood
mistook
his
confusion
sensitive

always

their

i
in
preference
to

reasoning
question
was
perfectly
fair
he
there
was
something
incongruous
in
the
serious
earnestness
with
which
he
applied
himself
to
an
argument
on
a
valentine
know
it
is
always
expected
that
privy
inquiries
will
be
made
where
if
the
word
had
been
it
could
not
have
been
uttered
with
a
more
constrained
and
restless
countenance
than
was
then
soon
parting
from
gabriel
the
lonely
and
reserved
man
returned
to
his
house
to
twinges
of
shame
and
regret
at
having
so
far
exposed
his
mood
by
those
fevered
questions
to
a
stranger
he
again
placed
the
letter
on
the
mantelpiece
and
sat
down
to
think
of
the
circumstances
attending
it
by
the
light
of

chapter
xvi
all
and
all
on
a
morning
a
small
congregation
consisting
mainly
of
women
and
girls
rose
from
its
knees
in
the
mouldy
nave
of
a
church
called
all
in
the
distant
at
the
end
of
a
service
without
a
sermon
they
were
about
to
disperse
when
a
smart
footstep
entering
the
porch
and
coming
up
the
central
passage
arrested
their
attention
the
step
echoed
with
a
ring
unusual
in
a
church
it
was
the
clink
of
spurs
everybody
looked
a
young
cavalry
soldier
in
a
red
uniform
with
the
three
chevrons
of
a
sergeant
upon
his
sleeve
strode
up
the
aisle
with
an
embarrassment
which
was
only
the
more
marked
by
the
intense
vigour
of
his
step
and
by
the
determination
upon
his
face
to
show
none
a
slight
flush
had
mounted
his
cheek
by
the
time
he
had
run
the
gauntlet
between
these
women
but
passing
on
through
the
chancel
arch
he
never
paused
till
he
came
close
to
the
altar
railing
here
for
a
moment
he
stood
alone
the
officiating
curate
who
had
not
yet
doffed
his
surplice
perceived
the
and
followed
him
to
the
he
whispered
to
the
soldier
and
then
beckoned
to
the
clerk
who
in
his
turn
whispered
to
an
elderly
woman
apparently
his
wife
and
they
also
went
up
the
chancel
steps
a
wedding
murmured
some
of
the
women
brightening
wait
the
majority
again
sat
down
there
was
a
creaking
of
machinery
behind
and
some
of
the
young
ones
turned
their
heads
from
the
interior
face
of
the
west
wall
of
the
tower
projected
a
little
canopy
with
a
and
small
bell
beneath
it
the
automaton
being
driven
by
the
same
clock
machinery
that
struck
the
large
bell
in
the
tower
between
the
tower
and
the
church
was
a
close
screen
the
door
of
which
was
kept
shut
during
services
hiding
this
grotesque
clockwork
from
sight
at
present
however
the
door
was
open
and
the
egress
of
the
jack
the
blows
on
the
bell
and
the
retreat
into
the
nook
again
were
visible
to
many
and
audible
throughout
the
church
the
jack
had
struck
eleven
the
woman
whispered
some
of
the
spectators
the
young
sergeant
stood
still
with
the
abnormal
rigidity
of
the
old
pillars
around
he
faced
the
and
was
as
silent
as
he
was
still
the
silence
grew
to
be
a
noticeable
thing
as
the
minutes
went
on
and
nobody
else
appeared
and
not
a
soul
moved
the
rattle
of
the
again
from
its
niche
its
blows
for
its
fussy
retreat
were
almost
painfully
abrupt
and
caused
many
of
the
congregation
to
start
palpably
wonder
where
the
woman
is
a
voice
whispered
again
there
began
now
that
slight
shifting
of
feet
that
artificial
coughing
among
several
which
betrays
a
nervous
suspense
at
length
there
was
a
titter
but
the
soldier
never
moved
there
he
stood
his
face
to
the
upright
as
a
column
his
cap
in
his
hand
the
clock
ticked
on
the
women
threw
off
their
nervousness
and
titters
and
giggling
became
more
frequent
then
came
a
dead
silence
every
one
was
waiting
for
the
end
some
persons
may
have
noticed
how
extraordinarily
the
striking
of
quarters
seems
to
quicken
the
flight
of
time
it
was
hardly
credible
that
the
jack
had
not
got
wrong
with
the
minutes
when
the
rattle
began
again
the
puppet
emerged
and
the
four
quarters
were
struck
fitfully
as
before
one
could
almost
be
positive
that
there
was
a
malicious
leer
upon
the
hideous
face
and
a
mischievous
delight
in
its
twitchings
then
followed
the
dull
and
remote
resonance
of
the
twelve
heavy
strokes
in
the
tower
above
the
women
were
impressed
and
there
was
no
giggle
this
time
the
clergyman
glided
into
the
vestry
and
the
clerk
vanished
the
sergeant
had
not
yet
turned
every
woman
in
the
church
was
waiting
to
see
his
face
and
he
appeared
to
know
it
at
last
he
did
turn
and
stalked
resolutely
down
the
nave
braving
them
all
with
a
compressed
lip
two
bowed
and
toothless
old
almsmen
then
looked
at
each
other
and
chuckled
innocently
enough
but
the
sound
had
a
strange
weird
effect
in
that
place
opposite
to
the
church
was
a
paved
square
around
which
several
overhanging
wood
buildings
of
old
time
cast
a
picturesque
shade
the
young
man
on
leaving
the
door
went
to
cross
the
square
when
in
the
middle
he
met
a
little
woman
the
expression
of
her
face
which
had
been
one
of
intense
anxiety
sank
at
the
sight
of
his
nearly
to
terror
he
said
in
a
suppressed
passion
fixedly
looking
at
her
made
a
mistake
thought
that
church
with
the
spire
was
all
and
i
was
at
the
door
at
eleven
to
a
minute
as
you
said
i
waited
till
a
quarter
to
twelve
and
found
then
that
i
was
in
all
but
i
much
frightened
for
i
thought
it
could
be
as
fool
for
so
fooling
me
but
say
no
it
be
frank
she
asked
blankly
and
he
gave
vent
to
a
hoarse
laugh
go
through
that
experience
again
for
some
time
i
warrant
you
after
all
she
expostulated
in
a
trembling
voice
mistake
was
not
such
a
terrible
thing
now
dear
frank
when
shall
it
be
when
god
knows
he
said
with
a
light
irony
and
turning
from
her
walked
rapidly
away
chapter
xvii
in
the
on
saturday
boldwood
was
in
casterbridge
market
house
as
usual
when
the
disturber
of
his
dreams
entered
and
became
visible
to
him
adam
had
awakened
from
his
deep
sleep
and
behold
there
was
eve
the
farmer
took
courage
and
for
the
first
time
really
looked
at
her
material
causes
and
emotional
effects
are
not
to
be
arranged
in
regular
equation
the
result
from
capital
employed
in
the
production
of
any
movement
of
a
mental
nature
is
sometimes
as
tremendous
as
the
cause
itself
is
absurdly
minute
when
women
are
in
a
freakish
mood
their
usual
intuition
either
from
carelessness
or
inherent
defect
seemingly
fails
to
teach
them
this
and
hence
it
was
that
bathsheba
was
fated
to
be
astonished
boldwood
looked
at
slily
critically
or
understandingly
but
blankly
at
gaze
in
the
way
a
reaper
looks
up
at
a
passing
something
foreign
to
his
element
and
but
dimly
understood
to
boldwood
women
had
been
remote
phenomena
rather
than
necessary
of
such
uncertain
aspect
movement
and
permanence
that
whether
their
orbits
were
as
geometrical
unchangeable
and
as
subject
to
laws
as
his
own
or
as
absolutely
erratic
as
they
superficially
appeared
he
had
not
deemed
it
his
duty
to
consider
he
saw
her
black
hair
her
correct
facial
curves
and
profile
and
the
roundness
of
her
chin
and
throat
he
saw
then
the
side
of
her
eyelids
eyes
and
lashes
and
the
shape
of
her
ear
next
he
noticed
her
figure
her
skirt
and
the
very
soles
of
her
shoes
boldwood
thought
her
beautiful
but
wondered
whether
he
was
right
in
his
thought
for
it
seemed
impossible
that
this
romance
in
the
flesh
if
so
sweet
as
he
imagined
could
have
been
going
on
long
without
creating
a
commotion
of
delight
among
men
and
provoking
more
inquiry
than
bathsheba
had
done
even
though
that
was
not
a
little
to
the
best
of
his
judgement
neither
nature
nor
art
could
improve
this
perfect
one
of
an
imperfect
many
his
heart
began
to
move
within
him
boldwood
it
must
be
remembered
though
forty
years
of
age
had
never
before
inspected
a
woman
with
the
very
centre
and
force
of
his
glance
they
had
struck
upon
all
his
senses
at
wide
angles
was
she
really
beautiful
he
could
not
assure
himself
that
his
opinion
was
true
even
now
he
furtively
said
to
a
neighbour
miss
everdene
considered
handsome
yes
she
was
a
good
deal
noticed
the
first
time
she
came
if
you
remember
a
very
handsome
girl
a
man
is
never
more
credulous
than
in
receiving
favourable
opinions
on
the
beauty
of
a
woman
he
is
half
or
quite
in
love
with
a
mere
word
on
the
point
has
the
weight
of
an
boldwood
was
satisfied
now
and
this
charming
woman
had
in
effect
said
to
him
why
should
she
have
done
that
strange
thing
blindness
to
the
difference
between
approving
of
what
circumstances
suggest
and
originating
what
they
do
not
suggest
was
well
matched
by
insensibility
to
the
possibly
great
issues
of
little
beginnings
she
was
at
this
moment
coolly
dealing
with
a
dashing
young
farmer
adding
up
accounts
with
him
as
indifferently
as
if
his
face
had
been
the
pages
of
a
ledger
it
was
evident
that
such
a
nature
as
his
had
no
attraction
for
a
woman
of
taste
but
boldwood
grew
hot
down
to
his
hands
with
an
incipient
jealousy
he
trod
for
the
first
time
the
threshold
of
injured
his
first
impulse
was
to
go
and
thrust
himself
between
them
this
could
be
done
but
only
in
one
asking
to
see
a
sample
of
her
corn
boldwood
renounced
the
idea
he
could
not
make
the
request
it
was
debasing
loveliness
to
ask
it
to
buy
and
sell
and
jarred
with
his
conceptions
of
her
all
this
time
bathsheba
was
conscious
of
having
broken
into
that
dignified
stronghold
at
last
his
eyes
she
knew
were
following
her
everywhere
this
was
a
triumph
and
had
it
come
naturally
such
a
triumph
would
have
been
the
sweeter
to
her
for
this
piquing
delay
but
it
had
been
brought
about
by
misdirected
ingenuity
and
she
valued
it
only
as
she
valued
an
artificial
flower
or
a
wax
fruit
being
a
woman
with
some
good
sense
in
reasoning
on
subjects
wherein
her
heart
was
not
involved
bathsheba
genuinely
repented
that
a
freak
which
had
owed
its
existence
as
much
to
liddy
as
to
herself
should
ever
have
been
undertaken
to
disturb
the
placidity
of
a
man
she
respected
too
highly
to
deliberately
tease
she
that
day
nearly
formed
the
intention
of
begging
his
pardon
on
the
very
next
occasion
of
their
meeting
the
worst
features
of
this
arrangement
were
that
if
he
thought
she
ridiculed
him
an
apology
would
increase
the
offence
by
being
disbelieved
and
if
he
thought
she
wanted
him
to
woo
her
it
would
read
like
additional
evidence
of
her
forwardness
chapter

boldwood
in
boldwood
was
tenant
of
what
was
called
little
weatherbury
farm
and
his
person
was
the
nearest
approach
to
aristocracy
that
this
remoter
quarter
of
the
parish
could
boast
of
genteel
strangers
whose
god
was
their
town
who
might
happen
to
be
compelled
to
linger
about
this
nook
for
a
day
heard
the
sound
of
light
wheels
and
prayed
to
see
good
society
to
the
degree
of
a
solitary
lord
or
squire
at
the
very
least
but
it
was
only
boldwood
going
out
for
the
day
they
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
yet
once
more
and
were
to
expectancy
it
was
only
boldwood
coming
home
again
his
house
stood
recessed
from
the
road
and
the
stables
which
are
to
a
farm
what
a
fireplace
is
to
a
room
were
behind
their
lower
portions
being
lost
amid
bushes
of
laurel
inside
the
blue
door
open
down
were
to
be
seen
at
this
time
the
backs
and
tails
of
warm
and
contented
horses
standing
in
their
stalls
and
as
thus
viewed
they
presented
alternations
of
roan
and
bay
in
shapes
like
a
moorish
arch
the
tail
being
a
streak
down
the
midst
of
each
over
these
and
lost
to
the
eye
gazing
in
from
the
outer
light
the
mouths
of
the
same
animals
could
be
heard
busily
sustaining
the
warmth
and
plumpness
by
quantities
of
oats
and
hay
the
restless
and
shadowy
figure
of
a
colt
wandered
about
a
at
the
end
whilst
the
steady
grind
of
all
the
eaters
was
occasionally
diversified
by
the
rattle
of
a
rope
or
the
stamp
of
a
foot
pacing
up
and
down
at
the
heels
of
the
animals
was
farmer
boldwood
himself
this
place
was
his
almonry
and
cloister
in
one
here
after
looking
to
the
feeding
of
his
dependants
the
celibate
would
walk
and
meditate
of
an
evening
till
the
rays
streamed
in
through
the
cobwebbed
windows
or
total
darkness
enveloped
the
scene
his
perpendicularity
showed
more
fully
now
than
in
the
crowd
and
bustle
of
the
in
this
meditative
walk
his
foot
met
the
floor
with
heel
and
toe
simultaneously
and
his
fine
face
was
bent
downwards
just
enough
to
render
obscure
the
still
mouth
and
the
though
rather
prominent
and
broad
chin
a
few
clear
and
horizontal
lines
were
the
only
interruption
to
the
otherwise
smooth
surface
of
his
large
forehead
the
phases
of
life
were
ordinary
enough
but
his
was
not
an
ordinary
nature
that
stillness
which
struck
casual
observers
more
than
anything
else
in
his
character
and
habit
and
seemed
so
precisely
like
the
rest
of
inanition
may
have
been
the
perfect
balance
of
enormous
antagonistic
and
negatives
in
fine
adjustment
his
equilibrium
disturbed
he
was
in
extremity
at
once
if
an
emotion
possessed
him
at
all
it
ruled
him
a
feeling
not
mastering
him
was
entirely
latent
stagnant
or
rapid
it
was
never
slow
he
was
always
hit
mortally
or
he
was
missed
he
had
no
light
and
careless
touches
in
his
constitution
either
for
good
or
for
evil
stern
in
the
outlines
of
action
mild
in
the
details
he
was
serious
throughout
all
he
saw
no
absurd
sides
to
the
follies
of
life
and
thus
though
not
quite
companionable
in
the
eyes
of
merry
men
and
scoffers
and
those
to
whom
all
things
show
life
as
a
jest
he
was
not
intolerable
to
the
earnest
and
those
acquainted
with
grief
being
a
man
who
read
all
the
dramas
of
life
seriously
if
he
failed
to
please
when
they
were
comedies
there
was
no
frivolous
treatment
to
reproach
him
for
when
they
chanced
to
end
tragically
bathsheba
was
far
from
dreaming
that
the
dark
and
silent
shape
upon
which
she
had
so
carelessly
thrown
a
seed
was
a
hotbed
of
tropic
intensity
had
she
known
moods
her
blame
would
have
been
fearful
and
the
stain
upon
her
heart
ineradicable
moreover
had
she
known
her
present
power
for
good
or

this
man
she
would
have
trembled
at
her
responsibility
luckily
for
her
present
unluckily
for
her
future

understanding
had
not

told
her
what
boldwood

nobody
knew
entirely
for
though
it
was
possible
to
form
guesses
concerning
his
wild
capabilities
from

he
had
never
been

a
hedge
and
on
the
other
side
of
this
a
meadow
belonging
to
farm
it
was
now
early
time
of
going
to
grass
with
the
sheep
when
they
have
the
first
feed
of
the
meadows
before
these
are
laid
up
for
mowing
the
wind
which
had
been
blowing
east
for
several
weeks
had
veered
to
the
southward
and
the
middle
of
spring
had
come
without
a
beginning
it
was
that
period
in
the
vernal
quarter
when
we
may
suppose
the
dryads
to
be
waking
for
the
season
the
vegetable
world
begins
to
move
and
swell
and
the
saps
to
rise
till
in
the
completest
silence
of
lone
gardens
and
trackless
plantations
where
everything
seems
helpless
and
still
after
the
bond
and
slavery
of
frost
there
are
bustlings
strainings
united
thrusts
and
in
comparison
with
which
the
powerful
tugs
of
cranes
and
pulleys
in
a
noisy
city
are
but
pigmy
efforts
boldwood
looking
into
the
distant
meadows
saw
there
three
figures
they
were
those
of
miss
everdene
shepherd
oak
and
cainy
ball
when
figure
shone
upon
the
eyes
it
lighted
him
up
as
the
moon
lights
up
a
great
tower
a
body
is
as
the
shell
or
the
tablet
of
his
soul
as
he
is
reserved
or
ingenuous
overflowing
or
there
was
a
change
in
exterior
from
its
former
impassibleness
and
his
face
showed
that
he
was
now
living
outside
his
defences
for
the
first
time
and
with
a
fearful
sense
of
exposure
it
is
the
usual
experience
of
strong
natures
when
they
love
at
last
he
arrived
at
a
conclusion
it
was
to
go
across
and
inquire
boldly
of
her
the
insulation
of
his
heart
by
reserve
during
these
many
years
without
a
channel
of
any
kind
for
disposable
emotion
had
worked
its
effect
it
has
been
observed
more
than
once
that
the
causes
of
love
are
chiefly
subjective
and
boldwood
was
a
living
testimony
to
the
truth
of
the
proposition
no
mother
existed
to
absorb
his
devotion
no
sister
for
his
tenderness
no
idle
ties
for
sense
he
became
surcharged
with
the
compound
which
was
genuine
love
he
approached
the
gate
of
the
meadow
beyond
it
the
ground
was
melodious
with
ripples
and
the
sky
with
larks
the
low
bleating
of
the
flock
mingling
with
both
mistress
and
man
were
engaged
in
the
operation
of
making
a
lamb
which
is
performed
whenever
an
ewe
has
lost
her
own
offspring
one
of
the
twins
of
another
ewe
being
given
her
as
a
substitute
gabriel
had
skinned
the
dead
lamb
and
was
tying
the
skin
over
the
body
of
the
live
lamb
in
the
customary
manner
whilst
bathsheba
was
holding
open
a
little
pen
of
four
hurdles
into
which
the
mother
and
foisted
lamb
were
driven
where
they
would
remain
till
the
old
sheep
conceived
an
affection
for
the
young
one
bathsheba
looked
up
at
the
completion
of
the
manœuvre
and
saw
the
farmer
by
the
gate
where
he
was
overhung
by
a
willow
tree
in
full
bloom
gabriel
to
whom
her
face
was
as
the
uncertain
glory
of
an
april
day
was
ever
regardful
of
its
faintest
changes
and
instantly
discerned
thereon
the
mark
of
some
influence
from
without
in
the
form
of
a
keenly
reddening
he
also
turned
and
beheld
boldwood
at
once
connecting
these
signs
with
the
letter
boldwood
had
shown
him
gabriel
suspected
her
of
some
coquettish
procedure
begun
by
that
means
and
carried
on
since
he
knew
not
how
farmer
boldwood
had
read
the
pantomime
denoting
that
they
were
aware
of
his
presence
and
the
perception
was
as
too
much
light
turned
upon
his
new
sensibility
he
was
still
in
the
road
and
by
moving
on
he
hoped
that
neither
would
recognize
that
he
had
originally
intended
to
enter
the
field
he
passed
by
with
an
utter
and
overwhelming
sensation
of
ignorance
shyness
and
doubt
perhaps
in
her
manner
there
were
signs
that
she
wished
to
see
could
not
read
a
woman
the
cabala
of
this
erotic
philosophy
seemed
to
consist
of
the
subtlest
meanings
expressed
in
misleading
ways
every
turn
look
word
and
accent
contained
a
mystery
quite
distinct
from
its
obvious
import
and
not
one
had
ever
been
pondered
by
him
until
now
as
for
bathsheba
she
was
not
deceived
into
the
belief
that
farmer
boldwood
had
walked
by
on
business
or
in
idleness
she
collected
the
probabilities
of
the
case
and
concluded
that
she
was
herself
responsible
for
appearance
there
it
troubled
her
much
to
see
what
a
great
flame
a
little
wildfire
was
likely
to
kindle
bathsheba
was
no
schemer
for
marriage
nor
was
she
deliberately
a
trifler
with
the
affections
of
men
and
a
experience
on
seeing
an
actual
flirt
after
observing
her
would
have
been
a
feeling
of
surprise
that
bathsheba
could
be
so
different
from
such
a
one
and
yet
so
like
what
a
flirt
is
supposed
to
be
she
resolved
never
again
by
look
or
by
sign
to
interrupt
the
steady
flow
of
this
life
but
a
resolution
to
avoid
an
evil
is
seldom
framed
till
the
evil
is
so
far
advanced
as
to
make
avoidance
impossible
chapter
xix
the
offer
boldwood
did
eventually
call
upon
her
she
was
not
at
home
course
not
he
murmured
in
contemplating
bathsheba
as
a
woman
he
had
forgotten
the
accidents
of
her
position
as
an
being
as
much
of
a
farmer
and
as
extensive
a
farmer
as
himself
her
probable
whereabouts
was
at
this
time
of
the
year
this
and
the
other
oversights
boldwood
was
guilty
of
were
natural
to
the
mood
and
still
more
natural
to
the
circumstances
the
great
aids
to
idealization
in
love
were
present
here
occasional
observation
of
her
from
a
distance
and
the
absence
of
social
intercourse
with
familiarity
oral
strangeness
the
smaller
human
elements
were
kept
out
of
sight
the
pettinesses
that
enter
so
largely
into
all
earthly
living
and
doing
were
disguised
by
the
accident
of
lover
and
not
being
on
visiting
terms
and
there
was
hardly
awakened
a
thought
in
boldwood
that
sorry
household
realities
appertained
to
her
or
that
she
like
all
others
had
moments
of
commonplace
when
to
be
least
plainly
seen
was
to
be
most
prettily
remembered
thus
a
mild
sort
of
apotheosis
took
place
in
his
fancy
whilst
she
still
lived
and
breathed
within
his
own
horizon
a
troubled
creature
like
himself
it
was
the
end
of
may
when
the
farmer
determined
to
be
no
longer
repulsed
by
trivialities
or
distracted
by
suspense
he
had
by
this
time
grown
used
to
being
in
love
the
passion
now
startled
him
less
even
when
it
tortured
him
more
and
he
felt
himself
adequate
to
the
situation
on
inquiring
for
her
at
her
house
they
had
told
him
she
was
at
the
and
he
went
off
to
seek
her
there
the
pool
was
a
perfectly
circular
basin
of
brickwork
in
the
meadows
full
of
the
clearest
water
to
birds
on
the
wing
its
glassy
surface
reflecting
the
light
sky
must
have
been
visible
for
miles
around
as
a
glistening
eye
in
a
green
face
the
grass
about
the
margin
at
this
season
was
a
sight
to
remember
a
minor
sort
of
way
its
activity
in
sucking
the
moisture
from
the
rich
damp
sod
was
almost
a
process
observable
by
the
eye
the
outskirts
of
this
level
were
diversified
by
rounded
and
hollow
pastures
where
just
now
every
flower
that
was
not
a
buttercup
was
a
daisy
the
river
slid
along
noiselessly
as
a
shade
the
swelling
reeds
and
sedge
forming
a
flexible
palisade
upon
its
moist
brink
to
the
north
of
the
mead
were
trees
the
leaves
of
which
were
new
soft
and
moist
not
yet
having
stiffened
and
darkened
under
summer
sun
and
drought
their
colour
being
yellow
beside
a
beside
a
yellow
from
the
recesses
of
this
knot
of
foliage
the
loud
notes
of
three
cuckoos
were
resounding
through
the
still
air
boldwood
went
meditating
down
the
slopes
with
his
eyes
on
his
boots
which
the
yellow
pollen
from
the
buttercups
had
bronzed
in
artistic
gradations
a
tributary
of
the
main
stream
flowed
through
the
basin
of
the
pool
by
an
inlet
and
outlet
at
opposite
points
of
its
diameter
shepherd
oak
jan
coggan
moon
poorgrass
cain
ball
and
several
others
were
assembled
here
all
dripping
wet
to
the
very
roots
of
their
hair
and
bathsheba
was
standing
by
in
a
new
most
elegant
she
had
ever
reins
of
her
horse
being
looped
over
her
arm
flagons
of
cider
were
rolling
about
upon
the
green
the
meek
sheep
were
pushed
into
the
pool
by
coggan
and
matthew
moon
who
stood
by
the
lower
hatch
immersed
to
their
waists
then
gabriel
who
stood
on
the
brink
thrust
them
under
as
they
swam
along
with
an
instrument
like
a
crutch
formed
for
the
purpose
and
also
for
assisting
the
exhausted
animals
when
the
wool
became
saturated
and
they
began
to
sink
they
were
let
out
against
the
stream
and
through
the
upper
opening
all
impurities
flowing
away
below
cainy
ball
and
joseph
who
performed
this
latter
operation
were
if
possible
wetter
than
the
rest
they
resembled
dolphins
under
a
fountain
every
protuberance
and
angle
of
their
clothes
dribbling
forth
a
small
rill
boldwood
came
close
and
bade
her
good
morning
with
such
constraint
that
she
could
not
but
think
he
had
stepped
across
to
the
washing
for
its
own
sake
hoping
not
to
find
her
there
more
she
fancied
his
brow
severe
and
his
eye
slighting
bathsheba
immediately
contrived
to
withdraw
and
glided
along
by
the
river
till
she
was
a
throw
off
she
heard
footsteps
brushing
the
grass
and
had
a
consciousness
that
love
was
encircling
her
like
a
perfume
instead
of
turning
or
waiting
bathsheba
went
further
among
the
high
sedges
but
boldwood
seemed
determined
and
pressed
on
till
they
were
completely
past
the
bend
of
the
river
here
without
being
seen
they
could
hear
the
splashing
and
shouts
of
the
washers
above
everdene
said
the
farmer
she
trembled
turned
and
said
his
tone
was
so
utterly
removed
from
all
she
had
expected
as
a
beginning
it
was
lowness
and
quiet
accentuated
an
emphasis
of
deep
meanings
their
form
at
the
same
time
being
scarcely
expressed
silence
has
sometimes
a
remarkable
power
of
showing
itself
as
the
disembodied
soul
of
feeling
wandering
without
its
carcase
and
it
is
then
more
impressive
than
speech
in
the
same
way
to
say
a
little
is
often
to
tell
more
than
to
say
a
great
deal
boldwood
told
everything
in
that
word
as
the
consciousness
expands
on
learning
that
what
was
fancied
to
be
the
rumble
of
wheels
is
the
reverberation
of
thunder
so
did
at
her
intuitive
conviction
too
think
he
said
with
a
solemn
simplicity
have
come
to
speak
to
you
without
preface
my
life
is
not
my
own
since
i
have
beheld
you
clearly
miss
come
to
make
you
an
offer
of
bathsheba
tried
to
preserve
an
absolutely
neutral
countenance
and
all
the
motion
she
made
was
that
of
closing
lips
which
had
previously
been
a
little
parted
am
now
years
old
he
went
on
may
have
been
called
a
confirmed
bachelor
and
i
was
a
confirmed
bachelor
i
had
never
any
views
of
myself
as
a
husband
in
my
earlier
days
nor
have
i
made
any
calculation
on
the
subject
since
i
have
been
older
but
we
all
change
and
my
change
in
this
matter
came
with
seeing
you
i
have
felt
lately
more
and
more
that
my
present
way
of
living
is
bad
in
every
respect
beyond
all
things
i
want
you
as
my
feel
boldwood
that
though
i
respect
you
much
i
do
not
would
justify
me
accepting
your
offer
she
stammered
this
giving
back
of
dignity
for
dignity
seemed
to
open
the
sluices
of
feeling
that
boldwood
had
as
yet
kept
closed
life
is
a
burden
without
you
he
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
want
want
you
to
let
me
say
i
love
you
again
and
again
bathsheba
answered
nothing
and
the
horse
upon
her
arm
seemed
so
impressed
that
instead
of
cropping
the
herbage
she
looked
up
think
and
hope
you
care
enough
for
me
to
listen
to
what
i
have
to
tell
momentary
impulse
at
hearing
this
was
to
ask
why
he
thought
that
till
she
remembered
that
far
from
being
a
conceited
assumption
on
part
it
was
but
the
natural
conclusion
of
serious
reflection
based
on
deceptive
premises
of
her
own
offering
wish
i
could
say
courteous
flatteries
to
you
the
farmer
continued
in
an
easier
tone
put
my
rugged
feeling
into
a
graceful
shape
but
i
have
neither
power
nor
patience
to
learn
such
things
i
want
you
for
my
wildly
that
no
other
feeling
can
abide
in
me
but
i
should
not
have
spoken
out
had
i
not
been
led
to
valentine
again
o
that
valentine
she
said
to
herself
but
not
a
word
to
him
you
can
love
me
say
so
miss
everdene
if
say
no
boldwood
it
is
painful
to
have
to
say
i
am
surprised
so
that
i
know
how
to
answer
you
with
propriety
and
am
only
just
able
to
speak
out
my
mean
my
meaning
that
i
am
afraid
i
marry
you
much
as
i
respect
you
you
are
too
dignified
for
me
to
suit
you
miss
everdene
know
i
ought
never
to
have
dreamt
of
sending
that
me
was
a
wanton
thing
which
no
woman
with
any
should
have
done
if
you
will
only
pardon
my
thoughtlessness
i
promise
never
no
no
say
thoughtlessness
make
me
think
it
was
something
it
was
a
sort
of
prophetic
beginning
of
a
feeling
that
you
would
like
me
you
torture
me
to
say
it
was
done
in
never
thought
of
it
in
that
light
and
i
endure
it
ah
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
win
you
but
that
i
can
only
ask
if
i
have
already
got
you
if
i
have
not
and
it
is
not
true
that
you
have
come
unwittingly
to
me
as
i
have
to
you
i
can
say
no
have
not
fallen
in
love
with
you
i
must
say
she
allowed
a
very
small
smile
to
creep
for
the
first
time
over
her
serious
face
in
saying
this
and
the
white
row
of
upper
teeth
and
lips
already
noticed
suggested
an
idea
of
heartlessness
which
was
immediately
contradicted
by
the
pleasant
eyes
you
will
just
kindness
and
condescension
you
can
not
bear
with
me
as
a
husband
i
fear
i
am
too
old
for
you
but
believe
me
i
will
take
more
care
of
you
than
would
many
a
man
of
your
own
age
i
will
protect
and
cherish
you
with
all
my
will
indeed
you
shall
have
no
worried
by
no
household
affairs
and
live
quite
at
ease
miss
everdene
the
dairy
superintendence
shall
be
done
by
a
can
afford
it
shall
never
have
so
much
as
to
look
out
of
doors
at
haymaking
time
or
to
think
of
weather
in
the
harvest
i
rather
cling
to
the
chaise
because
it
is
the
same
my
poor
father
and
mother
drove
but
if
you
like
it
i
will
sell
it
and
you
shall
have
a
of
your
own
i
can
not
say
how
far
above
every
other
idea
and
object
on
earth
you
seem
to
only
much
you
are
to
me
heart
was
young
and
it
swelled
with
sympathy
for
the
man
who
spoke
so
simply
say
it
i
can
not
bear
you
to
feel
so
much
and
me
to
feel
nothing
and
i
am
afraid
they
will
notice
us
boldwood
will
you
let
the
matter
rest
now
i
can
not
think
collectedly
i
did
not
know
you
were
going
to
say
this
to
me
oh
i
am
wicked
to
have
made
you
suffer
so
she
was
frightened
as
well
as
agitated
at
his
vehemence
then
that
you
absolutely
refuse
do
not
quite
refuse
can
do
nothing
i
can
not
may
speak
to
you
again
on
the
subject
may
think
of
you
i

may
think
of
hope
to
obtain
you

let
us

call
upon
you

me
will
give
you
any
time
he
said
earnestly
and
gratefully
am
happier
beg
you
be
happier
if
happiness
only
comes
from
my
agreeing
be
neutral
boldwood
i
must
will
wait
he
said
and
then
she
turned
away
boldwood
dropped
his
gaze
to
the
ground
and
stood
long
like
a
man
who
did
not
know
where
he
was
realities
then
returned
upon
him
like
the
pain
of
a
wound
received
in
an
excitement
which
eclipses
it
and
he
too
then
went
on
chapter
xx
the
quarrel
is
so
disinterested
and
kind
to
offer
me
all
that
i
can
desire
bathsheba
mused
yet
farmer
boldwood
whether
by
nature
kind
or
the
reverse
to
kind
did
not
exercise
kindness
here
the
rarest
offerings
of
the
purest
loves
are
but
a
and
no
generosity
at
all
bathsheba
not
being
the
least
in
love
with
him
was
eventually
able
to
look
calmly
at
his
offer
it
was
one
which
many
women
of
her
own
station
in
the
neighbourhood
and
not
a
few
of
higher
rank
would
have
been
wild
to
accept
and
proud
to
publish
in
every
point
of
view
ranging
from
politic
to
passionate
it
was
desirable
that
she
a
lonely
girl
should
marry
and
marry
this
earnest
and
respected
man
he
was
close
to
her
doors
his
standing
was
sufficient
his
qualities
were
even
supererogatory
had
she
felt
which
she
did
not
any
wish
whatever
for
the
married
state
in
the
abstract
she
could
not
reasonably
have
rejected
him
being
a
woman
who
frequently
appealed
to
her
understanding
for
deliverance
from
her
whims
boldwood
as
a
means
to
marriage
was
unexceptionable
she
esteemed
and
liked
him
yet
she
did
not
want
him
it
appears
that
ordinary
men
take
wives
because
possession
is
not
possible
without
marriage
and
that
ordinary
women
accept
husbands
because
marriage
is
not
possible
without
possession
with
totally
differing
aims
the
method
is
the
same
on
both
sides
but
the
understood
incentive
on
the
part
was
wanting
here
besides
position
as
absolute
mistress
of
a
farm
and
house
was
a
novel
one
and
the
novelty
had
not
yet
begun
to
wear
off
but
a
disquiet
filled
her
which
was
somewhat
to
her
credit
for
it
would
have
affected
few
beyond
the
mentioned
reasons
with
which
she
combated
her
objections
she
had
a
strong
feeling
that
having
been
the
one
who
began
the
game
she
ought
in
honesty
to
accept
the
consequences
still
the
reluctance
remained
she
said
in
the
same
breath
that
it
would
be
ungenerous
not
to
marry
boldwood
and
that
she
do
it
to
save
her
life
was
an
impulsive
nature
under
a
deliberative
aspect
an
elizabeth
in
brain
and
a
mary
stuart
in
spirit
she
often
performed
actions
of
the
greatest
temerity
with
a
manner
of
extreme
discretion
many
of
her
thoughts
were
perfect
syllogisms
unluckily
they
always
remained
thoughts
only
a
few
were
irrational
assumptions
but
unfortunately
they
were
the
ones
which
most
frequently
grew
into
deeds
the
next
day
to
that
of
the
declaration
she
found
gabriel
oak
at
the
bottom
of
her
garden
grinding
his
shears
for
the
all
the
surrounding
cottages
were
more
or
less
scenes
of
the
same
operation
the
scurr
of
whetting
spread
into
the
sky
from
all
parts
of
the
village
as
from
an
armoury
previous
to
a
campaign
peace
and
war
kiss
each
other
at
their
hours
of
scythes
shears
and
ranking
with
swords
bayonets
and
lances
in
their
common
necessity
for
point
and
edge
cainy
ball
turned
the
handle
of
grindstone
his
head
performing
a
melancholy
up
and
down
with
each
turn
of
the
wheel
oak
stood
somewhat
as
eros
is
represented
when
in
the
act
of
sharpening
his
arrows
his
figure
slightly
bent
the
weight
of
his
body
thrown
over
on
the
shears
and
his
head
balanced
with
a
critical
compression
of
the
lips
and
contraction
of
the
eyelids
to
crown
the
attitude
his
mistress
came
up
and
looked
upon
them
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
then
she
go
to
the
lower
mead
and
catch
the
bay
mare
turn
the
winch
of
the
grindstone
i
want
to
speak
to
you
cain
departed
and
bathsheba
took
the
handle
gabriel
had
glanced
up
in
intense
surprise
quelled
its
expression
and
looked
down
again
bathsheba
turned
the
winch
and
gabriel
applied
the
shears
the
peculiar
motion
involved
in
turning
a
wheel
has
a
wonderful
tendency
to
benumb
the
mind
it
is
a
sort
of
attenuated
variety
of
punishment
and
contributes
a
dismal
chapter
to
the
history
of
gaols
the
brain
gets
muddled
the
head
grows
heavy
and
the
centre
of
gravity
seems
to
settle
by
degrees
in
a
leaden
lump
somewhere
between
the
eyebrows
and
the
crown
bathsheba
felt
the
unpleasant
symptoms
after
two
or
three
dozen
turns
you
turn
gabriel
and
let
me
hold
the
shears
she
said
head
is
in
a
whirl
and
i
gabriel
turned
bathsheba
then
began
with
some
awkwardness
allowing
her
thoughts
to
stray
occasionally
from
her
story
to
attend
to
the
shears
which
required
a
little
nicety
in
sharpening
wanted
to
ask
you
if
the
men
made
any
observations
on
my
going
behind
the
sedge
with
boldwood
yesterday
they
did
said
gabriel
hold
the
shears
right
knew
you
know
the
like
he
relinquished
the
winch
and
inclosing
her
two
hands
completely
in
his
own
taking
each
as
we
sometimes
slap
a
hand
in
teaching
him
to
write
grasped
the
shears
with
her
the
edge
so
he
said
hands
and
shears
were
inclined
to
suit
the
words
and
held
thus
for
a
peculiarly
long
time
by
the
instructor
as
he
spoke
will
do
exclaimed
bathsheba
my
hands
i
have
them
held
turn
the
gabriel
freed
her
hands
quietly
retired
to
his
handle
and
the
grinding
went
on
the
men
think
it
odd
she
said
again
was
not
the
idea
did
they
say
farmer
name
and
your
own
were
likely
to
be
flung
over
pulpit
together
before
the
year
was
thought
so
by
the
look
of
them
why
nothing
in
it
a
more
foolish
remark
was
never
made
and
i
want
you
to
contradict
it
what
i
came
gabriel
looked
incredulous
and
sad
but
between
his
moments
of
incredulity
relieved
must
have
heard
our
conversation
she
continued
then
bathsheba
said
oak
stopping
the
handle
and
gazing
into
her
face
with
astonishment
everdene
you
mean
she
said
with
dignity
mean
this
that
if
boldwood
really
spoke
of
marriage
i
going
to
tell
a
story
and
say
he
to
please
you
i
have
already
tried
to
please
you
too
much
for
my
own
good
bathsheba
regarded
him
with
perplexity
she
did
not
know
whether
to
pity
him
for
disappointed
love
of
her
or
to
be
angry
with
him
for
having
got
over
tone
being
ambiguous
said
i
wanted
you
just
to
mention
that
it
was
not
true
i
was
going
to
be
married
to
him
she
murmured
with
a
slight
decline
in
her
assurance
can
say
that
to
them
if
you
wish
miss
everdene
and
i
could
likewise
give
an
opinion
to
on
what
you
have
daresay
but
i
want
your
suppose
not
said
gabriel
bitterly
and
going
on
with
his
turning
his
words
rising
and
falling
in
a
regular
swell
and
cadence
as
he
stooped
or
rose
with
the
winch
which
directed
them
according
to
his
position
perpendicularly
into
the
earth
or
horizontally
along
the
garden
his
eyes
being
fixed
on
a
leaf
upon
the
ground
with
bathsheba
a
hastened
act
was
a
rash
act
but
as
does
not
always
happen
time
gained
was
prudence
insured
it
must
be
added
however
that
time
was
very
seldom
gained
at
this
period
the
single
opinion
in
the
parish
on
herself
and
her
doings
that
she
valued
as
sounder
than
her
own
was
gabriel
and
the
outspoken
honesty
of
his
character
was
such
that
on
any
subject
even
that
of
her
love
for
or
marriage
with
another
man
the
same
disinterestedness
of
opinion
might
be
calculated
on
and
be
had
for
the
asking
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
impossibility
of
his
own
suit
a
high
resolve
constrained
him
not
to
injure
that
of
another
this
is
a
most
stoical
virtue
as
the
lack
of
it
is
a
most
venial
sin
knowing
he
would
reply
truly
she
asked
the
question
painful
as
she
must
have
known
the
subject
would
be
such
is
the
selfishness
of
some
charming
women
perhaps
it
was
some
excuse
for
her
thus
torturing
honesty
to
her
own
advantage
that
she
had
absolutely
no
other
sound
judgment
within
easy
reach
what
is
your
opinion
of
my
conduct
she
said
quietly
it
is
unworthy
of
any
thoughtful
and
meek
and
comely
in
an
instant
face
coloured
with
the
angry
crimson
of
a
danby
sunset
but
she
forbore
to
utter
this
feeling
and
the
reticence
of
her
tongue
only
made
the
loquacity
of
her
face
the
more
noticeable
the
next
thing
gabriel
did
was
to
make
a
mistake
you
like
the
rudeness
of
my
reprimanding
you
for
i
know
it
is
rudeness
but
i
thought
it
would
do
she
instantly
replied
the
contrary
my
opinion
of
you
is
so
low
that
i
see
in
your
abuse
the
praise
of
discerning
people
am
glad
you
mind
it
for
i
said
it
honestly
and
with
every
serious
see
but
unfortunately
when
you
try
not
to
speak
in
jest
you
are
as
when
you
wish
to
avoid
seriousness
you
sometimes
say
a
sensible
it
was
a
hard
hit
but
bathsheba
had
unmistakably
lost
her
temper
and
on
that
account
gabriel
had
never
in
his
life
kept
his
own
better
he
said
nothing
she
then
broke
may
ask
i
suppose
where
in
particular
my
unworthiness
lies
in
my
not
marrying
you
perhaps
by
any
means
said
gabriel
quietly
have
long
given
up
thinking
of
that
wishing
it
i
suppose
she
said
and
it
was
apparent
that
she
expected
an
unhesitating
denial
of
this
supposition
whatever
gabriel
felt
he
coolly
echoed
her
wishing
it
a
woman
may
be
treated
with
a
bitterness
which
is
sweet
to
her
and
with
a
rudeness
which
is
not
offensive
bathsheba
would
have
submitted
to
an
indignant
chastisement
for
her
levity
had
gabriel
protested
that
he
was
loving
her
at
the
same
time
the
impetuosity
of
passion
unrequited
is
bearable
even
if
it
stings
and
is
a
triumph
in
the
humiliation
and
a
tenderness
in
the
strife
this
was
what
she
had
been
expecting
and
what
she
had
not
got
to
be
lectured
because
the
lecturer
saw
her
in
the
cold
morning
light
of
disillusion
was
exasperating
he
had
not
finished
either
he
continued
in
a
more
agitated
voice
opinion
is
since
you
ask
it
that
you
are
greatly
to
blame
for
playing
pranks
upon
a
man
like
boldwood
merely
as
a
pastime
leading
on
a
man
you
care
for
is
not
a
praiseworthy
action
and
even
miss
everdene
if
you
seriously
inclined
towards
him
you
might
have
let
him
find
it
out
in
some
way
of
true
and
not
by
sending
him
a
bathsheba
laid
down
the
shears
can
not
allow
any
man
criticise
my
private
conduct
she
exclaimed
will
i
for
a
minute
so
please
leave
the
farm
at
the
end
of
the
week
it
may
have
been
a
any
rate
it
was
a
when
bathsheba
was
swayed
by
an
emotion
of
an
earthly
sort
her
lower
lip
trembled
when
by
a
refined
emotion
her
upper
or
heavenward
one
her
nether
lip
quivered
now
well
so
i
will
said
gabriel
calmly
he
had
been
held
to
her
by
a
beautiful
thread
which
it
pained
him
to
spoil
by
breaking
rather
than
by
a
chain
he
could
not
break
should
be
even
better
pleased
to
go
at
once
he
added
at
once
then
in
name
said
she
her
eyes
flashing
at
his
though
never
meeting
them
let
me
see
your
face
any
well
miss
it
shall
and
he
took
his
shears
and
went
away
from
her
in
placid
dignity
as
moses
left
the
presence

pharaoh

about
hours
when
on
sunday
afternoon
the

came
running
up
to
the
house
of
the

the
matter
men
she
said
meeting
them
at
the
door
just
as
she
was
coming
out
on
her
way
to
church
and
ceasing
in
a
moment
from
the
close
compression
of
her
two
red
lips
with
which
she
had
accompanied
the
exertion
of
pulling
on
a
tight
glove
said
joseph

said
tall
countenance
was
drawn
into
lines
and
puckers
by
his
concern
forehead
was
wrinkled
both
perpendicularly
and
crosswise
after
the
pattern
of
a
portcullis
expressive
of
a
double
despair
laban
lips
were
thin
and
his
face
was
rigid
jaws
sank
and
his
eyes
turned
whichever
way
the
strongest
muscle
happened
to
pull
them
said
joseph
i
was
sitting
at
home
looking
for
ephesians
and
says
i
to
myself
nothing
but
corinthians
and
thessalonians
in
this
danged
testament
when
who
should
come
in
but
henery
there
he
said
sheep
have
blasted
with
bathsheba
it
was
a
moment
when
thought
was
speech
and
speech
exclamation
moreover
she
had
hardly
recovered
her
equanimity
since
the
disturbance
which
she
had
suffered
from
remarks
enough
you
fools
she
cried
throwing
the
parasol
and
into
the
passage
and
running
out
of
doors
in
the
direction
signified
come
to
me
and
not
go
and
get
them
out
directly
oh
the
stupid
numskulls
her
eyes
were
at
their
darkest
and
brightest
now
beauty
belonging
rather
to
the
demonian
than
to
the
angelic
school
she
never
looked
so
well
as
when
she
was
particularly
when
the
effect
was
heightened
by
a
rather
dashing
velvet
dress
carefully
put
on
before
a
glass
all
the
ancient
men
ran
in
a
jumbled
throng
after
her
to
the
joseph
sinking
down
in
the
midst
when
about
like
an
individual
withering
in
a
world
which
was
more
and
more
insupportable
having
once
received
the
stimulus
that
her
presence
always
gave
them
they
went
round
among
the
sheep
with
a
will
the
majority
of
the
afflicted
animals
were
lying
down
and
could
not
be
stirred
these
were
bodily
lifted
out
and
the
others
driven
into
the
adjoining
field
here
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
several
more
fell
down
and
lay
helpless
and
livid
as
the
rest
bathsheba
with
a
sad
bursting
heart
looked
at
these
primest
specimens
of
her
prime
flock
as
they
rolled
swoln
with
wind
and
the
rank
mist
they
drew
many
of
them
foamed
at
the
mouth
their
breathing
being
quick
and
short
whilst
the
bodies
of
all
were
fearfully
distended
what
can
i
do
what
can
i
do
said
bathsheba
helplessly
are
such
unfortunate
animals
always
something
happening
to
them
i
never
knew
a
flock
pass
a
year
without
getting
into
some
scrape

only
one
way
of
saving

get
somebody
to
cure
the

instantly
all
then
stalked
off
in
consternation
to
get
somebody
as
directed
without
any
idea
of
who
it
was
to
be
in
a
minute
they
had
vanished
through
the

stood
alone
with

said
firmly
one
of
the
ewes
here
contracted
its
muscles
horribly
extended
itself
and
jumped
high
into
the
air
the
leap
was
an
astonishing
one
the

fell
heavily
and
lay
still
bathsheba
went
up

the
most
vigorous
expression
of

coincide
with
the
greatest
vigour
of
the
resolution
itself
it
is
often
flung
out
as
a
sort
of
prop
to
support
a
decaying
conviction
which
whilst
strong
required
no
enunciation
to
prove
it
so
the
i
of
bathsheba
meant
virtually
think
i
she
followed
her
assistants
through
the

lifted
her

with
only
a

by

diminished

almost

on
the

side
the

to
which
gabriel
had
retired
before
taking
his
final
departure
from

visible
as
a

spot
on
the
opposite

backed
by

bathsheba
walked
up

down
the
men
entered
the
field
and
endeavoured
to
ease
the
anguish
of
the
dumb
creatures
by
rubbing
them
nothing
availed
bathsheba
continued
walking
the

seen
descending

wearisome

the

said
bathsheba
gabriel

not

anywhere
he

she

came
into
the

and
leapt
off
his

tragic
as
after

the

opening

drawing
in

for

another
of
the
flock
sprang
into
the
air
and
fell
dead
the
men
looked
grave
as
if
they
suppressed
opinion
bathsheba
turned
aside
her
eyes
full
of
tears
the
strait
she
was
in
through
pride
and
shrewishness
could
not
be
disguised
longer
she
burst
out
crying
bitterly
they
all
saw
it
and
she
attempted
no
further
concealment
cry
about
it
miss
said
william

compassionately
not
ask
him
softer
like
sure
come
then
gable
is
a
true
man
in
that
bathsheba
checked
her
grief
and
wiped
her
eyes
it
is
a
wicked
cruelty
to
is
she
murmured
he
drives
me
to
do
what
i
yes
he
does
come
after
this
collapse
not
very
dignified
for
the
head
of
an
establishment
she
went
into
the
house
tall
at
her
heels
here
she
sat
down
and
hastily
scribbled
a
note
between
the
small
convulsive
sobs
of
convalescence
which
follow
a
fit
of
crying
as
a
follows
a
storm
the
note
was
none
the
less
polite
for
being
written
in
a
hurry
she
held
it
at
a
distance
was
about
to
fold
it
then
added
these
words
at
the
bottom
not
desert
me
gabriel
she
looked
a
little
redder
in
refolding
it
and
closed
her
lips
as
if
thereby
to
suspend
till
too
late
the
action
of
conscience
in
examining
whether
such
strategy
were
justifiable
the
note
was
despatched
as
the
message
had
been
and
bathsheba
waited
indoors
for
the
result
it
was
an
anxious
quarter
of
an
hour
that
intervened
between
the
departure
and
the
sound
of
the
tramp
again
outside
she
could
not
watch
this
time
but
leaning
over
the
old
bureau
at
which
she
had
written
the
letter
closed
her
eyes
as
if
to
keep
out
both
hope
and
fear
the
case
however
was
a
promising
one
gabriel
was
not
angry
he
was
simply
neutral
although
her
first
command
had
been
so
haughty
such
imperiousness
would
have
damned
a
little
less
beauty
and
on
the
other
hand
such
beauty
would
have
redeemed
a
little
less
imperiousness
she
went
out
when
the
horse
was
heard
and
looked
up
a
mounted
figure
passed
between
her
and
the
sky
and
drew
on
towards
the
field
of
sheep
the
rider
turning
his
face
in
receding
gabriel
looked
at
her
it
was
a
moment
when
a
eyes
and
tongue
tell
distinctly
opposite
tales
bathsheba
looked
full
of
gratitude
and
she
said
gabriel
how
could
you
serve
me
so
unkindly
such
a
reproach
for
his
previous
delay
was
the
one
speech
in
the
language
that
he
could
pardon
for
not
being
commendation
of
his
readiness
now
gabriel
murmured
a
confused
reply
and
hastened
on
she
knew
from
the
look
which
sentence
in
her
note
had
brought
him
bathsheba
followed
to
the
field
gabriel
was
already
among
the
turgid
prostrate
forms
he
had
flung
off
his
coat
rolled
up
his
and
taken
from
his
pocket
the
instrument
of
salvation
it
was
a
small
tube
or
trochar
with
a
lance
passing
down
the
inside
and
gabriel
began
to
use
it
with
a
dexterity
that
would
have
graced
a
hospital
surgeon
passing
his
hand
over
the
left
flank
and
selecting
the
proper
point
he
punctured
the
skin
and
rumen
with
the
lance
as
it
stood
in
the
tube
then
he
suddenly
withdrew
the
lance
retaining
the
tube
in
its
place
a
current
of
air
rushed
up
the
tube
forcible
enough
to
have
extinguished
a
candle
held
at
the
orifice
it
has
been
said
that
mere
ease
after
torment
is
delight
for
a
time
and
the
countenances
of
these
poor
creatures
expressed
it
now
operations
were
successfully
performed
owing
to
the
great
hurry
necessitated
by
the
state
of
some
of
the
flock
gabriel
missed
his
aim
in
one
case
and
in
one
wide
of
the
mark
and
inflicting
a
mortal
blow
at
once
upon
the
suffering
ewe
four
had
died
three
recovered
without
an
operation
the
total
number
of
sheep
which
had
thus
strayed
and
injured
themselves
so
dangerously
was
when
the
man
had
ceased
from
his
labours
bathsheba
came
and
looked
him
in
the
face
will
you
stay
on
with
me
she
said
smiling
winningly
and
not
troubling
to
bring
her
lips
quite
together
again
at
the
end
because
there
was
going
to
be
another
smile
soon
will
said
gabriel
and
she
smiled
on
him
again

gabriel
lately
for
the
first
time
since
his
prostration
by
misfortune
had
been
independent
in
thought
and
vigorous
in
action
to
a
marked
which
powerless
without
an
opportunity
as
an

would
have

him

lift
upwards
when

but
this
incurable
loitering
beside

stole

the
day
they
sheared
in
the
great
barn
called
for
the
nonce
the
which
on
resembled
a
church
with
transepts
it
not
only
emulated
the
form
of
the
neighbouring
church
of
the
parish
but
vied
with
it
in
antiquity
whether
the
barn
had
ever
formed
one
of
a
group
of
conventual
buildings
nobody
seemed
to
be
aware
no
trace
of
such
surroundings
remained
the
vast
porches
at
the
sides
lofty
enough
to
admit
a
waggon
laden
to
its
highest
with
corn
in
the
sheaf
were
spanned
by
arches
of
stone
broadly
and
boldly
cut
whose
very
simplicity
was
the
origin
of
a
grandeur
not
apparent
in
erections
where
more
ornament
has
been
attempted
the
dusky
filmed
chestnut
roof
braced
and
tied
in
by
huge
collars
curves
and
diagonals
was
far
nobler
in
design
because
more
wealthy
in
material
than
of
those
in
our
modern
churches
along
each
side
wall
was
a
range
of
striding
buttresses
throwing
deep
shadows
on
the
spaces
between
them
which
were
perforated
by
lancet
openings
combining
in
their
proportions
the
precise
requirements
both
of
beauty
and
ventilation
one
could
say
about
this
barn
what
could
hardly
be
said
of
either
the
church
or
the
castle
akin
to
it
in
age
and
style
that
the
purpose
which
had
dictated
its
original
erection
was
the
same
with
that
to
which
it
was
still
applied
unlike
and
superior
to
either
of
those
two
typical
remnants
of
mediævalism
the
old
barn
embodied
practices
which
had
suffered
no
mutilation
at
the
hands
of
time
here
at
least
the
spirit
of
the
ancient
builders
was
at
one
with
the
spirit
of
the
modern
beholder
standing
before
this
abraded
pile
the
eye
regarded
its
present
usage
the
mind
dwelt
upon
its
past
history
with
a
satisfied
sense
of
functional
continuity
feeling
almost
of
gratitude
and
quite
of
pride
at
the
permanence
of
the
idea
which
had
heaped
it
up
the
fact
that
four
centuries
had
neither
proved
it
to
be
founded
on
a
mistake
inspired
any
hatred
of
its
purpose
nor
given
rise
to
any
reaction
that
had
battered
it
down
invested
this
simple
grey
effort
of
old
minds
with
a
repose
if
not
a
grandeur
which
a
too
curious
reflection
was
apt
to
disturb
in
its
ecclesiastical
and
military
compeers
for
once
mediævalism
and
modernism
had
a
common
the
lanceolate
windows
the
archstones
and
chamfers
the
orientation
of
the
axis
the
misty
chestnut
work
of
the
rafters
referred
to
no
exploded
fortifying
art
or
religious
creed
the
defence
and
salvation
of
the
body
by
daily
bread
is
still
a
study
a
religion
and
a
desire
the
large
side
doors
were
thrown
open
towards
the
sun
to
admit
a
bountiful
light
to
the
immediate
spot
of
the
operations
which
was
the
wood
in
the
centre
formed
of
thick
oak
black
with
age
and
polished
by
the
beating
of
flails
for
many
generations
till
it
had
grown
as
slippery
and
as
rich
in
hue
as
the
floors
of
an
elizabethan
mansion
here
the
shearers
knelt
the
sun
slanting
in
upon
their
bleached
shirts
tanned
arms
and
the
polished
shears
they
flourished
causing
these
to
bristle
with
a
thousand
rays
strong
enough
to
blind
a
man
beneath
them
a
captive
sheep
lay
panting
quickening
its
pants
as
misgiving
merged
in
terror
till
it
quivered
like
the
hot
landscape
outside
this
picture
of
in
its
frame
of
four
hundred
years
ago
did
not
produce
that
marked
contrast
between
ancient
and
modern
which
is
implied
by
the
contrast
of
date
in
comparison
with
cities
weatherbury
was
immutable
the

times
in

ten
years
or

in

three
or
four

were
included
in
the
mere
present
and
nothing
less
than
a
century
set
a
mark
on
its
face
or

five
decades
hardly
modified
the
cut
of
a

the

of

ten
generations
failed
to
alter
the
turn
of
a
single
phrase
in
these
wessex
nooks
the
busy
ancient
times
are
only
old
his
old
times
are
still
new
his
present
is
futurity
so
the
barn
was
natural
to
the
shearers
and
the
shearers
were
in
harmony
with
the
barn
the
spacious
ends
of
the
building
answering
ecclesiastically
to
nave
and
chancel
extremities
were
fenced
off
with
hurdles
the
sheep
being
all
collected
in
a
crowd
within
these
two
enclosures
and
in
one
angle
a
was
formed
in
which
three
or
four
sheep
were
continuously
kept
ready
for
the
shearers
to
seize
without
loss
of
time
in
the
background
mellowed
by
tawny
shade
were
the

and

miller
gathering
up
the
fleeces
and
twisting
ropes
of
wool
with
a
wimble
for
tying
them
round
they
were
indifferently
well
assisted
by
the
old
maltster
who
when
the
malting
season
from
october
to
april
had
passed
made
himself
useful
upon
any
of
the
bordering
farmsteads
behind
all
was
bathsheba
carefully
watching
the
men
to
see
that
there
was
no
cutting
or
wounding
through
carelessness
and
that
the
animals
were
shorn
close
gabriel
who
flitted
and
hovered
under
her
bright
eyes
like
a
moth
did
not
shear
continuously
half
his
time
being
spent
in
attending
to
the
others
and
selecting
the
sheep
for
them
at
the
present
moment
he
was
engaged
in
handing
round
a
mug
of
mild
liquor
supplied
from
a
barrel
in
the
corner
and
cut
pieces
of
bread
and
cheese
bathsheba
after
throwing
a
glance
here
a
caution
there
and
lecturing
one
of
the
younger
operators
who
had
allowed
his
last
finished
sheep
to
go
off
among
the
flock
without
it
with
her
initials
came
again
to
gabriel
as
he
put
down
the
luncheon
to
drag
a
frightened
ewe
to
his
flinging
it
over
upon
its
back
with
a
dexterous
twist
of
the
arm
he
lopped
off
the
tresses
about
its
head
and
opened
up
the
neck
and
collar
his
mistress
quietly
looking
on
blushes
at
the
insult
murmured
bathsheba
watching
the
pink
flush
which
arose
and
overspread
the
neck
and
shoulders
of
the
ewe
where
they
were
left
bare
by
the
clicking
flush
which
was
enviable
for
its
delicacy
by
many
queens
of
coteries
and
would
have
been
creditable
for
its
promptness
to
any
woman
in
the
world
poor
soul
was
fed
with
a
luxury
of
content
by
having
her
over
him
her
eyes
critically
regarding
his
skilful
shears
which
apparently
were
going
to
gather
up
a
piece
of
the
flesh
at
every
close
and
yet
never
did
so
like
guildenstern
oak
was
happy
in
that
he
was
not
over
happy
he
had
no
wish
to
converse
with
her
that
his
bright
lady
and
himself
formed
one
group
exclusively
their
own
and
containing
no
others
in
the
world
was
enough
so
the
chatter
was
all
on
her
side
there
is
a
loquacity
that
tells
nothing
which
was
and
there
is
a
silence
which
says
much
that
was
full
of
this
dim
and
temperate
bliss
he
went
on
to
fling
the
ewe
over
upon
her
other
side
covering
her
head
with
his
knee
gradually
running
the
shears
line
after
line
round
her
dewlap
thence
about
her
flank
and
back
and
finishing
over
the
tail
done
and
done
quickly
said
bathsheba
looking
at
her
watch
as
the
last
snip
resounded

miss

gabriel
wiping
his
brow
minutes
and
a
half
since
you
took
the
first
lock
from
its
forehead
it
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
ever
seen
one
done
in
less
than
half
an
the
clean
sleek
creature
arose
from
its
perfectly
like
aphrodite
rising
from
the
foam
should
have
been
seen
to
be
startled
and
shy
at
the
loss
of
its
garment
which
lay
on
the
floor
in
one
soft
cloud
united
throughout
the
portion
visible
being
the
inner
surface
only
which
never
before
exposed
was
white
as
snow
and
without
flaw
or

kind

mister
oak

now
runs
forward
with
the

newly
stamped
upon
the
shorn
skin
and
away
the
simple
dam
leaps
panting
over
the
board
into
the
shirtless
flock
outside
then
up
comes
maryann
throws
the
loose
locks
into
the
middle
of
the
fleece
rolls
it
up
and
carries
it
into
the
background
as
pounds
of
unadulterated
warmth
for
the
winter
enjoyment
of
persons
unknown
and
far
away
who
will
however
never
experience
the
superlative
comfort
derivable
from
the
wool
as
it
here
exists
new
and
the
unctuousness
of
its
nature
whilst
in
a
living
state
has
dried
stiffened
and
been
washed
it
just
now
as
superior
to
anything
as
cream
is
superior
to
but
heartless
circumstance
could
not
leave
entire
happiness
of
this
morning
the
rams
old
ewes
and
ewes
had
duly
undergone
their
stripping
and
the
men
were
proceeding
with
the
shearlings
and
hogs
when
belief
that
she
was
going
to
stand
pleasantly
by
and
time
him
through
another
performance
was
painfully
interrupted
by
farmer
appearance
in
the
extremest
corner
of
the
barn
nobody
seemed
to
have
perceived
his
entry
but
there
he
certainly
was
boldwood
always
carried
with
him
a
social
atmosphere
of
his
own
which
everybody
felt
who
came
near
him
and
the
talk
which
presence
had
somewhat
suppressed
was
now
totally
suspended
he
crossed
over
towards
bathsheba
who
turned
to
greet
him
with
a
carriage
of
perfect
ease
he
spoke
to
her
in
low
tones
and
she
instinctively
modulated
her
own
to
the
same
pitch
and
her
voice
ultimately
even
caught
the
inflection
of
his
she
was
far
from
having
a
wish
to
appear
mysteriously
connected
with
him
but
woman
at
the
impressionable
age
gravitates
to
the
larger
body
not
only
in
her
choice
of
words
which
is
apparent
every
day
but
even
in
her
shades
of
tone
and
humour
when
the
influence
is
great
what
they
conversed
about
was
not
audible
to
gabriel
who
was
too
independent
to
get
near
though
too
concerned
to
disregard
the
issue
of
their
dialogue
was
the
taking
of
her
hand
by
the
courteous
farmer
to
help
her
over
the
into
the
bright
june
sunlight
outside
standing
beside
the
sheep
already
shorn
they
went
on
talking
again
concerning
the
flock
apparently
not
gabriel
theorized
not
without
truth
that
in
quiet
discussion
of
any
matter
within
reach
of
the
eyes
these
are
usually
fixed
upon
it
bathsheba
demurely
regarded
a
contemptible
straw
lying
upon
the
ground
in
a
way
which
suggested
less
ovine
criticism
than
womanly
embarrassment
she
became
more
or
less
red
in
the
cheek
the
blood
wavering
in
uncertain
flux
and
reflux
over
the
sensitive
space
between
ebb
and
flood
gabriel
sheared
on
constrained
and
sad
she
left
side
and
he
walked
up
and
down
alone
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
she
reappeared
in
her
new
of
myrtle
green
which
fitted
her
to
the
waist
as
a
rind
fits
its
fruit
and
young
bob
coggan
led
on
her
mare
boldwood
fetching
his
own
horse
from
the
tree
under
which
it
had
been
tied
eyes
could
not
forsake
them
and
in
endeavouring
to
continue
his
shearing
at
the
same
time
that
he
watched
manner
he
snipped
the
sheep
in
the
groin
the
animal
plunged
bathsheba
instantly
gazed
towards
it
and
saw
the
blood
gabriel
she
exclaimed
with
severe
remonstrance
who
are
so
strict
with
the
other
what
you
are
doing
yourself
to
an
outsider
there
was
not
much
to
complain
of
in
this
remark
but
to
oak
who
knew
bathsheba
to
be
well
aware
that
she
herself
was
the
cause
of
the
poor
wound
because
she
had
wounded
the
shearer
in
a
still
more
vital
part
it
had
a
sting
which
the
abiding
sense
of
his
inferiority
to
both
herself
and
boldwood
was
not
calculated
to
heal
but
a
manly
resolve
to
recognize
boldly
that
he
had
no
longer
a
interest
in
her
helped
him
occasionally
to
conceal
a
feeling
he
shouted
in
an
unmoved
voice
of
routine
cainy
ball
ran
up
the
wound
was
anointed
and
the
shearing
continued
boldwood
gently
tossed
bathsheba
into
the
saddle
and
before
they
turned
away
she
again
spoke
out
to
oak
with
the
same
dominative
and
tantalizing
graciousness
am
going
now
to
see
leicesters
take
my
place
in
the
barn
gabriel
and
keep
the
men
carefully
to
their
the
heads
were
put
about
and
they
trotted
away
deep
attachment
was
a
matter
of
great
interest
among
all
around
him
but
after
having
been
pointed
out
for
so
many
years
as
the
perfect
exemplar
of
thriving
bachelorship
his
lapse
was
an
anticlimax
somewhat
resembling
that
of
john
death
by
consumption
in
the
midst
of
his
proofs
that
it
was
not
a
fatal

spoke
exhibiting
miserable
eyes
at
the
same
time
see
why
a
maid
should
take
a
husband
when
bold
enough
to
fight
her
own
battles
and
want
a
home
for
keeping
another
woman
out
but
let
it
be
for
a
pity
he
and
she
should
trouble
two
as
usual
with
decided
characters
bathsheba
invariably
provoked
the
criticism
of
individuals
like
henery
fray
her
emblazoned
fault
was
to
be
too
pronounced
in
her
objections
and
not
sufficiently
overt
in
her
likings
we
learn
that
it
is
not
the
rays
which
bodies
absorb
but
those
which
they
reject
that
give
them
the
colours
they
are
known
by
and
in
the
same
way
people
are
specialized
by
their
dislikes
and
antagonisms
whilst
their
goodwill
is
looked
upon
as
no
attribute
at
all
henery
continued
in
a
more
complaisant
mood
once
hinted
my
mind
to
her
on
a
few
things
as
nearly
as
a
battered
frame
dared
to
do
so
to
such
a
froward
piece
you
all
know
neighbours
what
a
man
i
be

how
i
come
down
with
my
powerful
words
when
my
pride
is
boiling

said

not

villainy
of

i

womankind
that
too
strong
for
her

well
and
i
would
have
said
it
had
death
and
salvation
overtook
me
for
it
such
is
my
spirit
when
i
have
a
true
man
and
proud
as
a
see
the
artfulness
why
about
being
baily
really
but
i
put
it
so
plain
that
she
could
understand
my
meaning
so
i
could
lay
it
on
all
the
stronger
that
was
my
depth
however
let
her
marry
an
she
will
perhaps
high
time
i
believe
farmer

kissed
her
behind

at

i
a
lie
said
gabriel
neighbour

said
henery
mildly
she
told
me
all
that
passed
said
oak
with
a
pharisaical
sense
that
he
was
not
as
other
shearers
in
this
matter
have
a
right
to
believe
it
said
henery
with
dudgeon
very
true
right
but
i
mid
see
a
little
distance
into
things
to
be
enough
for
a
place
is
a
poor
mere
a
trifle
more
than
nothing
however
i
look
round
upon
life
quite
cool
do
you
heed
me
neighbours
my
words
though
made

simple

i
can

deep
for

we
quite

no

the

querulous
voice
the

time
ye

we
all

were
in

was
likewise
liked
by
a
who

said
the

you
the
bent

hoary
man

satisfied
and
so
apparently
was

that
matters
should
continue

maryann
spoke
who
what
with
her
brown
complexion
and
the
working
wrapper
of

linsey
had
at
present
the
mellow
hue
of
an
old
sketch
in
some
of
nicholas
anybody
know
of
a
crooked
man
or
a
lame
or
any
fellow
at
all
that
would
do
for
poor
me
said
maryann
perfect
one
i
expect
to
get
at
my
time
of
life
if
i
could
hear
of
such
a
thing
do
me
more
good
than
toast
and
coggan
furnished
a
suitable
reply
oak
went
on
with
his
shearing
and
said
not
another
word
pestilent
moods
had
come
and
teased
away
his
quiet
bathsheba
had
shown
indications
of
anointing
him
above
his
fellows
by
installing
him
as
the
bailiff
that
the
farm
imperatively
required
he
did
not
covet
the
post
relatively
to
the
farm
in
relation
to
herself
as
beloved
by
him
and
unmarried
to
another
he
had
coveted
it
his
readings
of
her
seemed
now
to
be
vapoury
and
indistinct
his
lecture
to
her
was
he
thought
one
of
the
absurdest
mistakes
far
from
coquetting
with
boldwood
she
had
trifled
with
himself
in
thus
feigning
that
she
had
trifled
with
another
he
was
inwardly
convinced
that
in
accordance
with
the
anticipations
of
his
and
comrades
that
day
would
see
boldwood
the
accepted
husband
of
miss
everdene
gabriel
at
this
time
of
his
life
had
the
instinctive
dislike
which
every
christian
boy
has
for
reading
the
bible
perusing
it
now
quite
frequently
and
he
inwardly
said
find
more
bitter
than
death
the
woman
whose
heart
is
snares
and
nets
this
was
mere
froth
of
the
storm

adored

chapter
xxiii
second
declaration
for
the
a
long
table
was
placed
on
the
beside
the
house
the
end
of
the
table
being
thrust
over
the
sill
of
the
wide
parlour
window
and
a
foot
or
two
into
the
room
miss
everdene
sat
inside
the
window
facing
down
the
table
she
was
thus
at
the
head
without
mingling
with
the
men
this
evening
bathsheba
was
unusually
excited
her
red
cheeks
and
lips
contrasting
lustrously
with
the
mazy
skeins
of
her
shadowy
hair
she
seemed
to
expect
assistance
and
the
seat
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
was
at
her
request
left
vacant
until
after
they
had
begun
the
meal
she
then
asked
gabriel
to
take
the
place
and
the
duties
appertaining
to
that
end
which
he
did
with
great
readiness
at
this
moment
boldwood
came
in
at
the
gate
and
crossed
the
green
to
bathsheba
at
the
window
he
apologized
for
his
lateness
his
arrival
was
evidently
by
arrangement
said
she
you
move
again
please
and
let
boldwood
come
there
oak
moved
in
silence
back
to
his
original
seat
the
was
dressed
in
cheerful
style
in
a
new
coat
and
white
waistcoat
quite
contrasting
with
his
usual
sober
suits
of
grey
inwardy
too
he
was
blithe
and
consequently
chatty
to
an
exceptional
degree
so
also
was
bathsheba
now
that
he
had
come
though
the
uninvited
presence
of
pennyways
the
bailiff
who
had
been
dismissed
for
theft
disturbed
her
equanimity
for
a
while
supper
being
ended
coggan
began
on
his
own
private
account
without
reference
to
listeners
lost

lost
my

and
i

i

my

i

this
lyric
when
concluded
was
received
with
a
silently
appreciative
gaze
at
the
table
implying
that
the
performance
like
a
work
by
those
established
authors
who
are
independent
of
notices
in
the
papers
was
a
delight
which
required
no
applause

expressing

by
an
inflection

looking

at

your

said
bathsheba
from
the
window
really
he
replied
in
a
yielding
tone
know
what
to
say
it
would
be
a
poor
plain
ballet
of
my
own
hear
said
the
poorgrass
thus
assured
trilled
forth
a
flickering
yet
commendable
piece
of
sentiment
the
tune
of
which
consisted
of
the
and
another
the
latter
being
the
sound
chiefly
dwelt
upon
this
was
so
successful
that
he
rashly
plunged
into
a
second
in
the
same
breath
after
a
few
false
starts
i
i
i
when

put
out

said
coggan
at
the
end
of
the
verse
do
was
a
very
taking
and
there
was
a
pretty
place
at
of
and
well
heaved
out

a
nasty
high
corner
when
a
voice
is
getting
crazed
next
verse
master
but
during
this
rendering
young
bob
coggan
exhibited
one
of
those
anomalies
which
will
afflict
little
people
when
other
persons
are
particularly
serious
in
trying
to
check
his
laughter
he
pushed
down
his
throat
as
much
of
the
tablecloth
as
he
could
get
hold
of
when
after
continuing
hermetically
sealed
for
a
short
time
his
mirth
burst
out
through
his
nose
joseph
perceived
it
and
with
hectic
cheeks
of
indignation
instantly
ceased
singing
coggan
boxed
ears
immediately
on
on
and
never
mind
the
young
scamp
said
coggan
a
very
catching
ballet
now
then
next
bar
help
ye
to
flourish
up
the
shrill
notes
where
yer
wind
is
rather
wheezy
oh
the
and

but
the
singer
could
not
be
set
going
again
bob
coggan
was
sent
home
for
his
ill
manners
and
tranquility
was
restored
by
jacob
smallbury
who
volunteered
a
ballad
as
inclusive
and
interminable
as
that
with
which
the
worthy
toper
old
silenus
amused
on
a
similar
occasion
the
swains
chromis
and
mnasylus
and
other
jolly
dogs
of
his
day
it
was
still
the
beaming
time
of
evening
though
night
was
stealthily
making
itself
visible
low
down
upon
the
ground
the
western
lines
of
light
raking
the
earth
without
alighting
upon
it
to
any
extent
or
illuminating
the
dead
levels
at
all
the
sun
had
crept
round
the
tree
as
a
last
effort
before
death
and
then
began
to
sink
the
lower
parts
becoming
steeped
in
embrowning
twilight
whilst
their
heads
and
shoulders
were
still
enjoying
day
touched
with
a
yellow
of
brilliancy
that
seemed
inherent
rather
than
acquired
the
sun
went
down
in
an
ochreous
mist
but
they
sat
and
talked
on
and
grew
as
merry
as
the
gods
in
heaven
bathsheba
still
remained
enthroned
inside
the
window
and
occupied
herself
in
knitting
from
which
she
sometimes
looked
up
to
view
the
fading
scene
outside
the
slow
twilight
expanded
and
enveloped
them
completely
before
the
signs
of
moving
were
shown
gabriel
suddenly
missed
farmer
boldwood
from
his
place
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
how
long
he
had
been
gone
oak
did
not
know
but
he
had
apparently
withdrawn
into
the
encircling
dusk
whilst
he
was
thinking
of
this
liddy
brought
candles
into
the
back
part
of
the
room
overlooking
the
shearers
and
their
lively
new
flames
shone
down
the
table
and
over
the
men
and
dispersed
among
the
green
shadows
behind
form
still
in
its
original
position
was
now
again
distinct
between
their
eyes
and
the
light
which
revealed
that
boldwood
had
gone
inside
the
room
and
was
sitting
near
her
next
came
the
question
of
the
evening
would
miss
everdene
sing
to
them
the
song
she
always
sang
so
banks
of
allan
they
went
home
after
a
consideration
bathsheba
assented
beckoning
to
gabriel
who
hastened
up
into
the
coveted
atmosphere
you
brought
your
flute
she
whispered
to
my
singing
she
stood
up
in
the
facing
the
men
the
candles
behind
her
gabriel
on
her
right
hand
immediately
outside
the
boldwood
had
drawn
up
on
her
left
within
the
room
her
singing
was
soft
and
rather
tremulous
at
first
but
it
soon
swelled
to
a
steady
clearness
subsequent
events
caused
one
of
the
verses
to
be
remembered
for
many
months
and
even
years
by
more
than
one
of
those
who
were
gathered
there
for
his
bride
a
soldier
sought
her
and
a
winning
tongue
had
he
on
the
banks
of
allan
water
none
was
gay
as
she
in
addition
to
the
dulcet
piping
of
flute
boldwood
supplied
a
bass
in
his
customary
profound
voice
uttering
his
notes
so
softly
however
as
to
abstain
entirely
from
making
anything
like
an
ordinary
duet
of
the
song
they
rather
formed
a
rich
unexplored
shadow
which
threw
her
tones
into
relief
the
shearers
reclined
against
each
other
as
at
suppers
in
the
early
ages
of
the
world
and
so
silent
and
absorbed
were
they
that
her
breathing
could
almost
be
heard
between
the
bars
and
at
the
end
of
the
ballad
when
the
last
tone
loitered
on
to
an
inexpressible
close
there
arose
that
buzz
of
pleasure
which
is
the
attar
of
applause
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
state
that
gabriel
could
not
avoid
noting
the
bearing
towards
their
entertainer
yet
there
was
nothing
exceptional
in
his
actions
beyond
what
appertained
to
his
time
of
performing
them
it
was
when
the
rest
were
all
looking
away
that
boldwood
observed
her
when
they
regarded
her
he
turned
aside
when
they
thanked
or
praised
he
was
silent
when
they
were
inattentive
he
murmured
his
thanks
the
meaning
lay
in
the
difference
between
actions
none
of
which
had
any
meaning
of
itself
and
the
necessity
of
being
jealous
which
lovers
are
troubled
with
did
not
lead
oak
to
underestimate
these
signs
bathsheba
then
wished
them
withdrew
from
the
window
and
retired
to
the
back
part
of
the
room
boldwood
thereupon
closing
the
sash
and
the
shutters
and
remaining
inside
with
her
oak
wandered
away
under
the
quiet
and
scented
trees
recovering
from
the
softer
impressions
produced
by
voice
the
shearers
rose
to
leave
coggan
turning
to
pennyways
as
he
pushed
back
the
bench
to
pass
out
like
to
give
praise
where
praise
is
due
and
the
man
deserves
do
so
he
remarked
looking
at
the
worthy
thief
as
if
he
were
the
masterpiece
of
some
artist
sure
i
should
never
have
believed
it
if
we
proved
it
so
to
allude
hiccupped
joseph
poorgrass
every
cup
every
one
of
the
best
knives
and
forks
and
every
empty
bottle
be
in
their
place
as
perfect
now
as
at
the
beginning
and
not
one
stole
at
sure
i
deserve
half
the
praise
you
give
me
said
the
virtuous
thief
grimly
say
this
for
pennyways
added
coggan
whenever
he
do
really
make
up
his
mind
to
do
a
noble
thing
in
the
shape
of
a
good
action
as
i
could
see
by
his
face
he
did
afore
sitting
down
generally
able
to
carry
it
out
yes
proud
to
say
neighbours
that
stole
nothing
at
an
honest
deed
and
we
thank
ye
for
it
pennyways
said
joseph
to
which
opinion
the
remainder
of
the
company
subscribed
unanimously
at
this
time
of
departure
when
nothing
more
was
visible
of
the
inside
of
the
parlour
than
a
thin
and
still
chink
of
light
between
the
shutters
a
passionate
scene
was
in
course
of
enactment
there
miss
everdene
and
boldwood
were
alone
her
cheeks
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
their
healthful
fire
from
the
very
seriousness
of
her
position
but
her
eye
was
bright
with
the
excitement
of
a
it
was
a
triumph
which
had
rather
been
contemplated
than
desired
she
was
standing
behind
a
low
from
which
she
had
just
risen
and
he
was
kneeling
in
himself
over
its
back
towards
her
and
holding
her
hand
in
both
his
own
his
body
moved
restlessly
and
it
was
with
what
keats
daintily
calls
a
too
happy
happiness
this
unwonted
abstraction
by
love
of
all
dignity
from
a
man
of
whom
it
had
ever
seemed
the
chief
component
was
in
its
distressing
incongruity
a
pain
to
her
which
quenched
much
of
the
pleasure
she
derived
from
the
proof
that
she
was
idolized
will
try
to
love
you
she
was
saying
in
a
trembling
voice
quite
unlike
her
usual
if
i
can
believe
in
any
way
that
i
shall
make
you
a
good
wife
i
shall
indeed
be
willing
to
marry
you
but
boldwood
hesitation
on
so
high
a
matter
is
honourable
in
any
woman
and
i
want
to
give
a
solemn
promise
i
would
rather
ask
you
to
wait
a
few
weeks
till
i
can
see
my
situation
better
you
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
have
every
reason
to
hope
that
at
the
end
of
the
five
or
six
weeks
between
this
time
and
harvest
that
you
say
you
are
going
to
be
away
from
home
i
shall
be
able
to
promise
to
be
your
wife
she
said
firmly
remember
this
distinctly
i
promise
is
enough
i
ask
more
i
can
wait
on
those
dear
words
and
now
miss
everdene
she
said
tenderly
and
boldwood
withdrew
with
a
serene
smile
bathsheba
knew
more
of
him
now
he
had
entirely
bared
his
heart
before
her
even
until
he
had
almost
worn
in
her
eyes
the
sorry
look
of
a
grand
bird
without
the
feathers
that
make
it
grand
she
had
been
at
her
past
temerity
and
was
struggling
to
make
amends
without
thinking
whether
the
sin
quite
deserved
the
penalty
she
was
schooling
herself
to
pay
to
have
brought
all
this
about
her
ears
was
terrible
but
after
a
while
the
situation
was
not
without
a
fearful
joy
the
facility
with
which
even
the
most
timid
women
sometimes
acquire
a
relish
for
the
dreadful
when
that
is
amalgamated
with
a
little
triumph
is
marvellous
chapter
xxiv
the
same
fir
plantation
among
the
multifarious
duties
which
bathsheba
had
voluntarily
imposed
upon
herself
by
dispensing
with
the
services
of
a
bailiff
was
the
particular
one
of
looking
round
the
homestead
before
going
to
bed
to
see
that
all
was
right
and
safe
for
the
night
gabriel
had
almost
constantly
preceded
her
in
this
tour
every
evening
watching
her
affairs
as
carefully
as
any
specially
appointed
officer
of
surveillance
could
have
done
but
this
tender
devotion
was
to
a
great
extent
unknown
to
his
mistress
and
as
much
as
was
known
was
somewhat
thanklessly
received
women
are
never
tired
of
bewailing
fickleness
in
love
but
they
only
seem
to
snub
his
constancy
as
watching
is
best
done
invisibly
she
usually
carried
a
dark
lantern
in
her
hand
and
every
now
and
then
turned
on
the
light
to
examine
nooks
and
corners
with
the
coolness
of
a
metropolitan
policeman
this
coolness
may
have
owed
its
existence
not
so
much
to
her
fearlessness
of
expected
danger
as
to
her
freedom
from
the
suspicion
of
any
her
worst
anticipated
discovery
being
that
a
horse
might
not
be
well
bedded
the
fowls
not
all
in
or
a
door
not
closed
this
night
the
buildings
were
inspected
as
usual
and
she
went
round
to
the
farm
paddock
here
the
only
sounds
disturbing
the
stillness
were
steady
munchings
of
many
mouths
and
stentorian
breathings
from
all
but
invisible
noses
ending
in
snores
and
puffs
like
the
blowing
of
bellows
slowly
then
the
munching
would
recommence
when
the
lively
imagination
might
assist
the
eye
to
discern
a
group
of
nostrils
shaped
as
caverns
and
very
clammy
and
humid
on
their
surfaces
not
exactly
pleasant
to
the
touch
until
one
got
used
to
them
the
mouths
beneath
having
a
great
partiality
for
closing
upon
any
loose
end
of
apparel
which
came
within
reach
of
their
tongues
above
each
of
these
a
still
keener
vision
suggested
a
brown
forehead
and
two
staring
though
not
unfriendly
eyes
and
above
all
a
pair
of
whitish
horns
like
two
particularly
new
moons
an
occasional
stolid
proclaiming
beyond
the
shade
of
a
doubt
that
these
phenomena
were
the
features
and
persons
of
daisy
whitefoot
spot
respectable
dairy
of
devon
cows
belonging
to
bathsheba
aforesaid
her
way
back
to
the
house
was
by
a
path
through
a
young
plantation
of
tapering
firs
which
had
been
planted
some
years
earlier
to
shelter
the
premises
from
the
north
wind
by
reason
of
the
density
of
the
interwoven
foliage
overhead
it
was
gloomy
there
at
cloudless
noontide
twilight
in
the
evening
dark
as
midnight
at
dusk
and
black
as
the
ninth
plague
of
egypt
at
midnight
to
describe
the
spot
is
to
call
it
a
vast
low
naturally
formed
hall
the
plumy
ceiling
of
which
was
supported
by
slender
pillars
of
living
wood
the
floor
being
covered
with
a
soft
dun
carpet
of
dead
spikelets
and
mildewed
cones
with
a
tuft
of
here
and
there
this
bit
of
the
path
was
always
the
crux
of
the
ramble
though
before
starting
her
apprehensions
of
danger
were
not
vivid
enough
to
lead
her
to
take
a
companion
slipping
along
here
covertly
as
time
bathsheba
fancied
she
could
hear
footsteps
entering
the
track
at
the
opposite
end
it
was
certainly
a
rustle
of
footsteps
her
own
instantly
fell
as
gently
as
snowflakes
she
reassured
herself
by
a
remembrance
that
the
path
was
public
and
that
the
traveller
was
probably
some
villager
returning
home
regretting
at
the
same
time
that
the
meeting
should
be
about
to
occur
in
the
darkest
point
of
her
route
even
though
only
just
outside
her
own
door
the
noise
approached
came
close
and
a
figure
was
apparently
on
the
point
of
gliding
past
her
when
something
tugged
at
her
skirt
and
pinned
it
forcibly
to
the
ground
the
instantaneous
check
nearly
threw
bathsheba
off
her
balance
in
recovering
she
struck
against
warm
clothes
and
buttons
rum
start
upon
my
soul
said
a
masculine
voice
a
foot
or
so
above
her
head
i
hurt
you
mate
said
bathsheba
attempting
to
shrink
away
have
got
hitched
together
somehow
i
you
a
woman
lady
i
should
have
am
a
bathsheba
softly
tugged
again
but
to
no
purpose
that
a
dark
lantern
you
have
i
fancy
so
said
the
man
allow
me
open
it
and
set
you
a
hand
seized
the
lantern
the
door
was
opened
the
rays
burst
out
from
their
prison
and
bathsheba
beheld
her
position
with
astonishment
the
man
to
whom
she
was
hooked
was
brilliant
in
brass
and
scarlet
he
was
a
soldier
his
sudden
appearance
was
to
darkness
what
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
is
to
silence
gloom
the
at
all
times
hitherto
was
now
totally
overthrown
less
by
the
than
by
what
the
lantern
lighted
the
contrast
of
this
revelation
with
her
anticipations
of
some
sinister
figure
in
sombre
garb
was
so
great
that
it
had
upon
her
the
effect
of
a
fairy
transformation
it
was
immediately
apparent
that
the
military
spur
had
become
entangled
in
the
gimp
which
decorated
the
skirt
of
her
dress
he
caught
a
view
of
her
face
unfasten
you
in
one
moment
miss
he
said
with
gallantry
can
do
it
thank
you
she
hastily
replied
and
stooped
for
the
performance
the
unfastening
was
not
such
a
trifling
affair
the
rowel
of
the
spur
had
so
wound
itself
among
the
gimp
cords
in
those
few
moments
that
separation
was
likely
to
be
a
matter
of
time
he
too
stooped
and
the
lantern
standing
on
the
ground
betwixt
them
threw
the
gleam
from
its
open
side
among
the
needles
and
the
blades
of
long
damp
grass
with
the
effect
of
a
large
glowworm
it
radiated
upwards
into
their
faces
and
sent
over
half
the
plantation
gigantic
shadows
of
both
man
and
woman
each
dusky
shape
becoming
distorted
and
mangled
upon
the
till
it
wasted
to
nothing
he
looked
hard
into
her
eyes
when
she
raised
them
for
a
moment
bathsheba
looked
down
again
for
his
gaze
was
too
strong
to
be
received
with
her
own
but
she
had
obliquely
noticed
that
he
was
young
and
slim
and
that
he
wore
three
chevrons
upon
his
sleeve
bathsheba
pulled
again
are
a
prisoner
miss
it
is
no
use
blinking
the
matter
said
the
soldier
drily
must
cut
your
dress
if
you
are
in
such
a
do
she
exclaimed
helplessly
be
necessary
if
you
could
wait
a
moment
and
he
unwound
a
cord
from
the
little
wheel
she
withdrew
her
own
hand
but
whether
by
accident
or
design
he
touched
it
bathsheba
was
vexed
she
hardly
knew
why
his
unravelling
went
on
but
it
nevertheless
seemed
coming
to
no
end
she
looked
at
him
again
you
for
the
sight
of
such
a
beautiful
face
said
the
young
sergeant
without
ceremony
she
coloured
with
embarrassment
unwillingly
shown
she
replied
stiffly
and
with
as
much
was
very
she
could
infuse
into
a
position
of
captivity
like
you
the
better
for
that
incivility
miss
he
said
should
have
had
never
shown
yourself
to
me
by
intruding
here
she
pulled
again
and
the
gathers
of
her
dress
began
to
give
way
like
liliputian
musketry
deserve
the
chastisement
your
words
give
me
but
why
should
such
a
fair
and
dutiful
girl
have
such
an
aversion
to
her
sex
on
your
way
beauty
and
drag
you
after
me
do
but
look
i
never
saw
such
a
tangle
shameful
of
you
you
have
been
making
it
worse
on
purpose
to
keep
me
have
i
think
so
said
the
sergeant
with
a
merry
twinkle
tell
you
you
have
she
exclaimed
in
high
temper
insist
upon
undoing
it
now
allow
me
miss
i
am
not
of
he
added
a
sigh
which
had
as
much
archness
in
it
as
a
sigh
could
possess
without
losing
its
nature
altogether
am
thankful
for
beauty
even
when
thrown
to
me
like
a
bone
to
a
dog
these
moments
will
be
over
too
soon
she
closed
her
lips
in
a
determined
silence
bathsheba
was
revolving
in
her
mind
whether
by
a
bold
and
desperate
rush
she
could
free
herself
at
the
risk
of
leaving
her
skirt
bodily
behind
her
the
thought
was
too
dreadful
the
she
had
put
on
to
appear
stately
at
the
the
head
and
front
of
her
wardrobe
not
another
in
her
stock
became
her
so
well
what
woman
in
position
not
naturally
timid
and
within
call
of
her
retainers
would
have
bought
escape
from
a
dashing
soldier
at
so
dear
a
price
in
good
time
it
will
soon
be
done
i
perceive
said
her
cool
friend
trifling
provokes
too
cruel
me
is
done
in
order
that
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
apologizing
to
so
charming
a
woman
which
i
straightway
do
most
humbly
madam
he
said
bowing
low
bathsheba
really
knew
not
what
to
say
seen
a
good
many
women
in
my
time
continued
the
young
man
in
a
murmur
and
more
thoughtfully
than
hitherto
critically
regarding
her
bent
head
at
the
same
time
never
seen
a
woman
so
beautiful
as
you
take
it
or
leave
offended
or
like
are
you
then
who
can
so
well
afford
to
despise
opinion
stranger
sergeant
troy
i
am
staying
in
this
it
is
undone
at
last
you
see
your
light
fingers
were
more
eager
than
mine
i
wish
it
had
been
the
knot
of
knots
which
no
untying
this
was
worse
and
worse
she
started
up
and
so
did
he
how
to
decently
get
away
from
was
her
difficulty
now
she
sidled
off
inch
by
inch
the
lantern
in
her
hand
till
she
could
see
the
redness
of
his
coat
no
longer
beauty
he
said
she
made
no
reply
and
reaching
a
distance
of
twenty
or
thirty
yards
turned
about
and
ran
indoors
liddy
had
just
retired
to
rest
in
ascending
to
her
own
chamber
bathsheba
opened
the
door
an
inch
or
two
and
panting
is
any
soldier
staying
in
the
gentlemanly
for
a
sergeant
and
good
red
coat
with
blue
facings
miss
no
i
say
but
really
it
might
be
sergeant
troy
home
on
furlough
though
i
have
not
seen
him
he
was
here
once
in
that
way
when
the
regiment
was
at
the
name
had
he
a
whiskers
or
beard
kind
of
a
person
is
he
blush
to
name
gay
man
but
i
know
him
to
be
very
quick
and
trim
who
might
have
made
his
thousands
like
a
squire
such
a
clever
young
dandy
as
he
is
a
son
by
name
which
is
a
great
deal
and
an
son
by
nature
is
a
great
deal
more
fancy
is
it
true
and
he
was
brought
up
so
well
and
sent
to
casterbridge
grammar
school
for
years
and
years
learnt
all
languages
while
he
was
there
and
it
was
said
he
got
on
so
far
that
he
could
take
down
chinese
in
shorthand
but
that
i
answer
for
as
it
was
only
reported
however
he
wasted
his
gifted
lot
and
listed
a
soldier
but
even
then
he
rose
to
be
a
sergeant
without
trying
at
all
ah
such
a
blessing
it
is
to
be
nobility
of
blood
will
shine
out
even
in
the
ranks
and
files
and
is
he
really
come
home
miss
believe
so
after
all
how
could
a
cheerful
wearer
of
skirts
be
permanently
offended
with
the
man
there
are
occasions
when
girls
like
bathsheba
will
put
up
with
a
great
deal
of
unconventional
behaviour
when
they
want
to
be
praised
which
is
often
when
they
want
to
be
mastered
which
is
sometimes
and
when
they
want
no
nonsense
which
is
seldom
just
now
the
first
feeling
was
in
the
ascendant
with
bathsheba
with
a
dash
of
the
second
moreover
by
chance
or
by
devilry
the
ministrant
was
antecedently
made
interesting
by
being
a
handsome
stranger
who
had
evidently
seen
better
days
so
she
could
not
clearly
decide
whether
it
was
her
opinion
that
he
had
insulted
her
or
not
ever
anything
so
odd
she
at
last
exclaimed
to
herself
in
her
own
room
was
ever
anything
so
meanly
done
as
what
i
skulk
away
like
that
from
a
man
who
was
only
civil
and
kind
clearly
she
did
not
think
his
barefaced
praise
of
her
person
an
insult
now
it
was
a
fatal
omission
of
that
he
had
never
once
told
her
she
was
beautiful
chapter
xxv
the
new
acquaintance
described
idiosyncrasy
and
vicissitude
had
combined
to
stamp
sergeant
troy
as
an
exceptional
being
he
was
a
man
to
whom
memories
were
an
incumbrance
and
anticipations
a
superfluity
simply
feeling
considering
and
caring
for
what
was
before
his
eyes
he
was
vulnerable
only
in
the
present
his
outlook
upon
time
was
as
a
transient
flash
of
the
eye
now
and
then
that
projection
of
consciousness
into
days
gone
by
and
to
come
which
makes
the
past
a
synonym
for
the
pathetic
and
the
future
a
word
for
circumspection
was
foreign
to
troy
with
him
the
past
was
yesterday
the
future
never
the
day
after
on
this
account
he
might
in
certain
lights
have
been
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
fortunate
of
his
order
for
it
may
be
argued
with
great
plausibility
that
reminiscence
is
less
an
endowment
than
a
disease
and
that
expectation
in
its
only
comfortable
of
absolute
practically
an
impossibility
whilst
in
the
form
of
hope
and
the
secondary
compounds
patience
impatience
resolve
curiosity
it
is
a
constant
fluctuation
between
pleasure
and
pain
sergeant
troy
being
entirely
innocent
of
the
practice
of
expectation
was
never
disappointed
to
set
against
this
negative
gain
there
may
have
been
some
positive
losses
from
a
certain
narrowing
of
the
higher
tastes
and
sensations
which
it
entailed
but
limitation
of
the
capacity
is
never
recognized
as
a
loss
by
the
loser
therefrom
in
this
attribute
moral
or
æsthetic
poverty
contrasts
plausibly
with
material
since
those
who
suffer
do
not
mind
it
whilst
those
who
mind
it
soon
cease
to
suffer
it
is
not
a
denial
of
anything
to
have
been
always
without
it
and
what
troy
had
never
enjoyed
he
did
not
miss
but
being
fully
conscious
that
what
sober
people
missed
he
enjoyed
his
capacity
though
really
less
seemed
greater
than
theirs
he
was
moderately
truthful
towards
men
but
to
women
lied
like
a
system
of
ethics
above
all
others
calculated
to
win
popularity
at
the
first
flush
of
admission
into
lively
society
and
the
possibility
of
the
favour
gained
being
transitory
had
reference
only
to
the
future
he
never
passed
the
line
which
divides
the
spruce
vices
from
the
ugly
and
hence
though
his
morals
had
hardly
been
applauded
disapproval
of
them
had
frequently
been
tempered
with
a
smile
this
treatment
had
led
to
his
becoming
a
sort
of
regrater
of
other
gallantries
to
his
own
aggrandizement
as
a
corinthian
rather
than
to
the
moral
profit
of
his
hearers
his
reason
and
his
propensities
had
seldom
any
reciprocating
influence
having
separated
by
mutual
consent
long
ago
thence
it
sometimes
happened
that
while
his
intentions
were
as
honourable
as
could
be
wished
any
particular
deed
formed
a
dark
background
which
threw
them
into
fine
relief
the
vicious
phases
being
the
offspring
of
impulse
and
his
virtuous
phases
of
cool
meditation
the
latter
had
a
modest
tendency
to
be
oftener
heard
of
than
seen
troy
was
full
of
activity
but
his
activities
were
less
of
a
locomotive
than
a
vegetative
nature
and
never
being
based
upon
any
original
choice
of
foundation
or
direction
they
were
exercised
on
whatever
object
chance
might
place
in
their
way
hence
whilst
he
sometimes
reached
the
brilliant
in
speech
because
that
was
spontaneous
he
fell
below
the
commonplace
in
action
from
inability
to
guide
incipient
effort
he
had
a
quick
comprehension
and
considerable
force
of
character
but
being
without
the
power
to
combine
them
the
comprehension
became
engaged
with
trivialities
whilst
waiting
for
the
will
to
direct
it
and
the
force
wasted
itself
in
useless
grooves
through
unheeding
the
comprehension
he
was
a
fairly
man
for
one
of
middle
well
educated
for
a
common
soldier
he
spoke
fluently
and
unceasingly
he
could
in
this
way
be
one
thing
and
seem
another
for
instance
he
could
speak
of
love
and
think
of
dinner
call
on
the
husband
to
look
at
the
wife
be
eager
to
pay
and
intend
to
owe
the
wondrous
power
of
flattery
in
at
woman
is
a
perception
so
universal
as
to
be
remarked
upon
by
many
people
almost
as
automatically
as
they
repeat
a
proverb
or
say
that
they
are
christians
and
the
like
without
thinking
much
of
the
enormous
corollaries
which
spring
from
the
proposition
still
less
is
it
acted
upon
for
the
good
of
the
complemental
being
alluded
to
with
the
majority
such
an
opinion
is
shelved
with
all
those
trite
aphorisms
which
require
some
catastrophe
to
bring
their
tremendous
meanings
thoroughly
home
when
expressed
with
some
amount
of
reflectiveness
it
seems
with
a
belief
that
this
flattery
must
be
reasonable
to
be
effective
it
is
to
the
credit
of
men
that
few
attempt
to
settle
the
question
by
experiment
and
it
is
for
their
happiness
perhaps
that
accident
has
never
settled
it
for
them
nevertheless
that
a
male
dissembler
who
by
deluging
her
with
untenable
fictions
charms
the
female
wisely
may
acquire
powers
reaching
to
the
extremity
of
perdition
is
a
truth
taught
to
many
by
unsought
and
wringing
occurrences
and
some
profess
to
have
attained
to
the
same
knowledge
by
experiment
as
aforesaid
and
jauntily
continue
their
indulgence
in
such
experiments
with
terrible
effect
sergeant
troy
was
one
he
had
been
known
to
observe
casually
that
in
dealing
with
womankind
the
only
alternative
to
flattery
was
cursing
and
swearing
there
was
no
third
method
them
fairly
and
you
are
a
lost
he
would
say
this
public
appearance
in
weatherbury
promptly
followed
his
arrival
there
a
week
or
two
after
the
shearing
bathsheba
feeling
a
nameless
relief
of
spirits
on
account
of
absence
approached
her
hayfields
and
looked
over
the
hedge
towards
the
haymakers
they
consisted
in
about
equal
proportions
of
gnarled
and
flexuous
forms
the
former
being
the
men
the
latter

women
who
wore
tilt
bonnets
covered
with
nankeen
which
hung
in
a
curtain

their
shoulders

humming
a

were
already
loading

the

raking
it
into
cocks
and

the

tossing
it
upon
the
waggon
from
behind
the
waggon
a
bright
scarlet
spot
emerged
and
went
on
loading
unconcernedly
with
the
rest
it
was
the
gallant
sergeant
who
had
come
haymaking
for
pleasure
and
nobody
could
deny
that
he
was
doing
the
mistress
of
the
farm
real
by
this
voluntary
contribution
of
his
labour
at
a
busy
time
as
soon
as
she
had
entered
the
field
troy
saw
her
and
sticking
his
pitchfork
into
the
ground
and
picking
up
his
crop
or
cane
he
came
forward
bathsheba
blushed
with
embarrassment
and
adjusted
her
eyes
as
well
as
her
feet
to
the
direct
line
of
her
path
chapter
xxvi
scene
on
the
verge
of
the
miss
everdene
said
the
sergeant
touching
his
diminutive
cap
did
i
think
it
was
you
i
was
speaking
to
the
other
night
and
yet
if
i
had
reflected
the
of
the
truth
is
truth
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
and
i
heard
you
so
named
in
casterbridge
yesterday
the
of
the
i
say
could
be
no
other
woman
i
step
across
now
to
beg
your
forgiveness
a
thousand
times
for
having
been
led
by
my
feelings
to
express
myself
too
strongly
for
a
stranger
to
be
sure
i
am
no
stranger
to
the
am
sergeant
troy
as
i
told
you
and
i
have
assisted
your
uncle
in
these
fields
no
end
of
times
when
i
was
a
lad
i
have
been
doing
the
same
for
you
suppose
i
must
thank
you
for
that
sergeant
troy
said
the
queen
of
the
in
an
indifferently
grateful
tone
the
sergeant
looked
hurt
and
sad
you
must
not
miss
everdene
he
said
could
you
think
such
a
thing
necessary
am
glad
it
is
if
i
may
ask
without
i
much
want
to
thank
you
for
am
afraid
i
have
made
a
hole
with
my
tongue
that
my
heart
will
never
mend
o
these
intolerable
times
that
should
follow
a
man
for
honestly
telling
a
woman
she
is
beautiful
the
most
i
must
own
that
and
the
least
i
could
i
own
is
some
talk
i
could
do
without
more
easily
than
that
remark
is
a
sort
of
it
means
that
i
would
rather
have
your
room
than
your
i
would
rather
have
curses
from
you
than
kisses
from
any
other
woman
so
stay
bathsheba
was
absolutely
speechless
and
yet
she
could
not
help
feeling
that
the
assistance
he
was
rendering
forbade
a
harsh
repulse
continued
troy
suppose
there
is
a
praise
which
is
rudeness
and
that
may
be
mine
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
treatment
which
is
injustice
and
that
may
be
yours
because
a
plain
blunt
man
who
has
never
been
taught
concealment
speaks
out
his
mind
without
exactly
intending
it
to
be
snapped
off
like
the
son
of
a
no
such
case
between
us
she
said
turning
away
allow
strangers
to
be
bold
and
in
praise
of
is
not
the
fact
but
the
method
which
offends
you
he
said
carelessly
i
have
the
sad
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
my
words
whether
pleasing
or
offensive
are
unmistakably
true
would
you
have
had
me
look
at
you
and
tell
my
acquaintance
that
you
are
quite
a
woman
to
save
you
the
embarrassment
of
being
stared
at
if
they
come
near
you
not
i
tell
any
such
ridiculous
lie
about
a
beauty
to
encourage
a
single
woman
in
england
in
too
excessive
a
is
all
you
are
saying
exclaimed
bathsheba
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
at
the
sly
method
have
a
rare
invention
sergeant
troy
why
you
have
passed
by
me
that
night
and
said
nothing
was
all
i
meant
to
reproach
you
i
going
to
half
the
pleasure
of
a
feeling
lies
in
being
able
to
express
it
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
i
let
out
mine
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
if
you
had
been
the
reverse
and
should
have
exclaimed
about
it
in
the
same
long
is
it
since
you
have
been
so
afflicted
with
strong
feeling
then
ever
since
i
was
big
enough
to
know
loveliness
from
to
be
hoped
your
sense
of
the
difference
you
speak
of
stop
at
faces
but
extends
to
morals
as
speak
of
morals
or
own
or
anybody
though
perhaps
i
should
have
been
a
very
good
christian
if
you
pretty
women
made
me
an
bathsheba
moved
on
to
hide
the
irrepressible
dimplings
of
merriment
troy
followed
whirling
his
crop
do
forgive
me
say
such
said
you
were
beautiful
and
say
so
still
for
by
so
you
are
the
most
beautiful
ever
i
saw
or
may
i
fall
dead
this
instant
why
upon
my
i

to
are
so
profane
she
said
in
a
restless
state
between
distress
at
hearing
him
and
a
to
hear
more
again
say
you
are
a
most
fascinating
woman
nothing
remarkable
in
my
saying
so
is
there
sure
the
fact
is
evident
enough

my
opinion
may
be
too
forcibly
let
out
to
please
you
and
for
the
matter
of
that
too
insignificant
to
convince
you
but
surely
it
is
honest
and
why
it
be
excused
a
correct
one
she
femininely
murmured
am
i
any
worse
for
breaking
the
third
of
that
terrible
ten
than
you
for
breaking
the
ninth
it
seem
true
to
me
that
i
am
fascinating
she
replied
evasively
so
to
you
then
i
say
with
all
respect
that
if
so
it
is
owing
to
your
modesty
miss
everdene
but
surely
you
must
have
been
told
by
everybody
of
what
everybody
notices
and
you
should
take
their
words
for
say
so
yes
they
must
i
mean
to
my
face
as
you
do
she
went
on
allowing
herself
to
be
further
lured
into
a
conversation
that
intention
had
rigorously
forbidden
you
know
they
think
so
certainly
have
heard
liddy
say
they
do
she
paused
was
the
purport
of
the
simple
reply
guarded
as
it
unknown
to
herself
never
did
a
fragile
tailless
sentence
convey
a
more
perfect
meaning
the
careless
sergeant
smiled
within
himself
and
probably
too
the
devil
smiled
from
a
in
tophet
for
the
moment
was
the
of
a
career
her
tone
and
mien
signified
beyond
mistake
that
the
seed
which
was
to
lift
the
foundation
had
taken
root
in
the
chink
the
remainder
was
a
mere
question
of
time
and
natural
changes
the
truth
comes
out
said
the
soldier
in
reply
tell
me
that
a
young
lady
can
live
in
a
buzz
of
admiration
without
knowing
something
about
it
ah
well
miss
everdene
you
my
blunt
are
rather
an
injury
to
our
race
than
she
said
opening
her
eyes
it
is
true
enough
i
may
as
well
be
hung
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
an
old
country
saying
not
of
much
account
but
it
will
do
for
a
rough
soldier
and
so
i
will
speak
my
mind
regardless
of
your
pleasure
and
without
hoping
or
intending
to
get
your
pardon
why
miss
everdene
it
is
in
this
manner
that
your
good
looks
may
do
more
harm
than
good
in
the
the
sergeant
looked
down
the
mead
in
critical
abstraction
some
one
man
on
an
average
falls
in
love
with
each
ordinary
woman
she
can
marry
him
he
is
content
and
leads
a
useful
life
such
women
as
you
a
hundred
men
always
eyes
will
bewitch
scores
on
scores
into
an
unavailing
fancy
for
can
only
marry
one
of
that
many
out
of
these
say
twenty
will
endeavour
to
drown
the
bitterness
of
despised
love
in
drink
twenty
more
will
mope
away
their
lives
without
a
wish
or
attempt
to
make
a
mark
in
the
world
because
they
have
no
ambition
apart
from
their
attachment
to
you
twenty
susceptible
person
myself
possibly
among
be
always
draggling
after
you
getting
where
they
may
just
see
you
doing
desperate
things
men
are
such
constant
fools
the
rest
may
try
to
get
over
their
passion
with
more
or
less
success
but
all
these
men
will
be
saddened
and
not
only
those
men
but
the
women
they
might
have
married
are
saddened
with
them
my
tale
why
i
say
that
a
woman
so
charming
as
yourself
miss
everdene
is
hardly
a
blessing
to
her
the
handsome
features
were
during
this
speech
as
rigid
and
stern
as
john
in
addressing
his
gay
young
queen
seeing
she
made
no
reply
he
said
you
read
french
i
began
but
when
i
got
to
the
verbs
father
died
she
said
simply
i
have
an
opportunity
which
latterly
has
not
been
often
my
mother
was
a
parisienne
a
proverb
they
have
aime
bien
châtie
chastens
who
loves
do
you
understand
me
she
replied
and
there
was
even
a
little
tremulousness
in
the
usually
cool
voice
you
can
only
fight
half
as
winningly
as
you
can
talk
you
are
able
to
make
a
pleasure
of
a
bayonet
wound
and
then
poor
bathsheba
instantly
perceived
her
slip
in
making
this
admission
in
hastily
trying
to
retrieve
it
she
went
from
bad
to
worse
however
suppose
that
derive
any
pleasure
from
what
you
tell
know
you
do
know
it
perfectly
said
troy
with
much
hearty
conviction
on
the
exterior
of
his
face
and
altering
the
expression
to
moodiness
a
dozen
men
are
ready
to
speak
tenderly
to
you
and
give
the
admiration
you
deserve
without
adding
the
warning
you
need
it
stands
to
reason
that
my
poor
mixture
of
praise
and
blame
can
not
convey
much
pleasure
fool
as
i
may
be
i
am
not
so
conceited
as
to
suppose
that
think
conceited
nevertheless
said
bathsheba
looking
askance
at
a
reed
she
was
fitfully
pulling
with
one
hand
having
lately
grown
feverish
under
the
system
of
because
the
nature
of
his
cajolery
was
entirely
unperceived
but
because
its
vigour
was
overwhelming
would
not
own
it
to
anybody
do
i
exactly
to
you
still
there
might
have
been
some
in
my
foolish
supposition
the
other
night
i
knew
that
what
i
said
in
admiration
might
be
an
opinion
too
often
forced
upon
you
to
give
any
pleasure
but
i
certainly
did
think
that
the
kindness
of
your
nature
might
prevent
you
judging
an
uncontrolled
tongue
you
have
thinking
badly
of
me
and
wounding
me
this
morning
when
i
am
working
hard
to
save
your
you
need
not
think
more
of
that
perhaps
you
did
not
mean
to
be
rude
to
me
by
speaking
out
your
mind
indeed
i
believe
you
did
not
said
the
shrewd
woman
in
painfully
innocent
earnest
i
thank
you
for
giving
help
here
mind
you
speak
to
me
again
in
that
way
or
in
any
other
unless
i
speak
to
miss
bathsheba
that
is
too
hard
it
why
is
it
will
never
speak
to
me
for
i
shall
not
be
here
long
i
am
soon
going
back
again
to
the
miserable
monotony
of
perhaps
our
regiment
will
be
ordered
out
soon
and
yet
you
take
away
the
one
little
of
pleasure
that
i
have
in
this
dull
life
of
mine
well
perhaps
generosity
is
not
a
most
marked
are
you
going
from
here
she
asked
with
some
interest
a
how
can
it
give
you
pleasure
to
speak
to
me
you
ask
miss
as
you
my
offence
is
based
on
you
do
care
so
much
for
a
silly
trifle
of
that
kind
then
i
mind
doing
it
she
uncertainly
and
doubtingly
answered
you
really
care
for
a
word
from
me
you
only
say
think
you
only
say
i
repeat
the
remark
i
am
too
gratified
to
get
such
a
mark
of
your
friendship
at
any
price
to
cavil
at
the
tone
i
miss
everdene
care
for
it
you
may
think
a
man
foolish
to
want
a
mere
a
good
morning
perhaps
he
know
but
you
have
never
been
a
man
looking
upon
a
woman
and
that
woman
you
know
nothing
of
what
such
an
experience
is
heaven
forbid
that
you
ever
should
flatterer
what
is
it
like
i
am
interested
in
shortly
it
is
not
being
able
to
think
hear
or
look
in
any
direction
except
one
without
wretchedness
nor
there
without
sergeant
it
are
pretending
she
said
shaking
her
head
words
are
too
dashing
to
be
am
not
upon
the
honour
of
a
is
it
so
course
i
ask
for
mere
you
are
so
i
am
so
look
like
am
you
only
saw
me
the
other
night
makes
no
difference
the
lightning
works
instantaneously
i
loved
you
then
at
i
do
bathsheba
surveyed
him
curiously
from
the
feet
upward
as
high
as
she
liked
to
venture
her
glance
which
was
not
quite
so
high
as
his
eyes
can
not
and
you
she
said
demurely
is
no
such
sudden
feeling
in
people
i
listen
to
you
any
longer
hear
me
i
wish
i
knew
what
it
am
have
wasted
too
much
time
here
already
the
sergeant
looked
at
his
watch
and
told
her
you
a
watch
miss
he
inquired
have
not
just
at
am
about
to
get
a
new
you
shall
be
given
one
shall
a
gift
miss
and
before
she
knew
what
the
young
man
was
intending
a
heavy
gold
watch
was
in
her
hand
is
an
unusually
good
one
for
a
man
like
me
to
possess
he
quietly
said
watch
has
a
history
press
the
spring
and
open
the
she
did
so
do
you
see
crest
and
a
coronet
with
five
points
and
beneath
amor
yields
to
the
motto
of
the
earls
of
severn
that
watch
belonged
to
the
last
lord
and
was
given
to
my
husband
a
medical
man
for
his
use
till
i
came
of
age
when
it
was
to
be
given
to
me
it
was
all
the
fortune
that
ever
i
inherited
that
watch
has
regulated
imperial
interests
in
its
stately
ceremonial
the
courtly
assignation
pompous
travels
and
lordly
sleeps
now
it
is
sergeant
troy
i
can
not
take
can
not
she
exclaimed
with
wonder
gold
watch
what
are
you
doing
be
such
a
dissembler
the
sergeant
retreated
to
avoid
receiving
back
his
gift
which
she
held
out
persistently
towards
him
bathsheba
followed
as
he
retired
miss
it
said
the
erratic
child
of
impulse
fact
of
your
possessing
it
makes
it
worth
ten
times
as
much
to
me
a
more
plebeian
one
will
answer
my
purpose
just
as
well
and
the
pleasure
of
knowing
whose
heart
my
old
one
beats
i
speak
of
that
it
is
in
far
worthier
hands
than
ever
it
has
been
in
indeed
i
have
it
she
said
in
a
perfect
simmer
of
distress
how
can
you
do
such
a
thing
that
is
if
you
really
mean
it
give
me
your
dead
watch
and
such
a
valuable
one
you
should
not
be
so
reckless
indeed
sergeant
troy
loved
my
father
good
but
better
i
love
you
more
how
i
can
do
it
said
the
sergeant
with
an
intonation
of
such
exquisite
fidelity
to
nature
that
it
was
evidently
not
all
acted
now
her
beauty
which
whilst
it
had
been
quiescent
he
had
praised
in
jest
had
in
its
animated
phases
moved
him
to
earnest
and
though
his
seriousness
was
less
than
she
imagined
it
was
probably
more
than
he
imagined
himself
bathsheba
was
brimming
with
agitated
bewilderment
and
she
said
in
accents
of
feeling
it
be
oh
how
can
it
be
that
you
care
for
me
and
so
suddenly
you
have
seen
so
little
of
me
i
may
not
be
really
as
i
seem
to
you
please
do
take
it
oh
do
i
can
not
and
will
not
have
it
believe
me
your
generosity
is
too
great
i
have
never
done
you
a
single
kindness
and
why
should
you
be
so
kind
to
me
a
factitious
reply
had
been
again
upon
his
lips
but
it
was
again
suspended
and
he
looked
at
her
with
an
arrested
eye
the
truth
was
that
as
she
now
wild
and
honest
as
the
alluring
beauty
bore
out
so
fully
the
epithets
he
had
bestowed
upon
it
that
he
was
quite
startled
at
his
temerity
in
advancing
them
as
false
he
said
mechanically
why
and
continued
to
look
at
her
my
workfolk
see
me
following
you
about
the
field
and
are
wondering
oh
this
is
dreadful
she
went
on
unconscious
of
the
transmutation
she
was
effecting
did
not
quite
mean
you
to
accept
it
at
first
for
it
was
my
one
poor
patent
of
nobility
he
broke
out
bluntly
upon
my
soul
i
wish
you
would
now
without
any
shamming
come
deny
me
the
happiness
of
wearing
it
for
my
sake
but
you
are
too
lovely
even
to
care
to
be
kind
as
others
no
say
so
i
have
reasons
for
reserve
which
i
can
not
it
be
then
let
it
be
he
said
receiving
back
the
watch
at
last
must
be
leaving
you
now
and
will
you
speak
to
me
for
these
few
weeks
of
my
stay
i
will
yet
i
know
if
i
will
oh
why
did
you
come
and
disturb
me
so
in
setting
a
gin
i
have
caught
myself
such
things
have
happened
well
will
you
let
me
work
in
your
fields
he
coaxed
i
suppose
so
if
it
is
any
pleasure
to
everdene
i
thank
the
sergeant
brought
his
hand
to
the
cap
on
the
slope
of
his
head
saluted
and
returned
to
the
distant
group
of
haymakers
bathsheba
could
not
face
the
haymakers
now
her
heart
erratically
flitting
hither
and
thither
from
perplexed
excitement
hot
and
almost
tearful
she
retreated
homeward
murmuring
what
have
i
done
what
does
it
mean
i
wish
i
knew
how
much
of
it
was
true
chapter
xxvii
hiving
the
bees
the
weatherbury
bees
were
late
in
their
swarming
this
year
it
was
in
the
latter
part
of
june
and
the
day
after
the
interview
with
troy
in
the
hayfield
that
bathsheba
was
standing
in
her
garden
watching
a
swarm
in
the
air
and
guessing
their
probable
settling
place
not
only
were
they
late
this
year
but
unruly
sometimes
throughout
a
whole
season
all
the
swarms
would
alight
on
the
lowest
attainable
as
part
of
a
or
espalier
next
year
they
would
with
just
the
same
unanimity
make
straight
off
to
the
uppermost
member
of
some
tall
gaunt
costard
or
quarrenden
and
there
defy
all
invaders
who
did
not
come
armed
with
ladders
and
staves
to
take
them
this
was
the
case
at
present
eyes
shaded
by
one
hand
were
following
the
ascending
multitude
against
the
unexplorable
stretch
of
blue
till
they
ultimately
halted
by
one
of
the
unwieldy
trees
spoken
of
a
process
somewhat
analogous
to
that
of
alleged
formations
of
the
universe
time
and
times
ago
was
observable
the
bustling
swarm
had
swept
the
sky
in
a
scattered
and
uniform
haze
which
now
thickened
to
a
nebulous
centre
this
glided
on
to
a
bough
and
grew
still
denser
till
it
formed
a
solid
black
spot
upon
the
light
the
men
and
women
being
all
busily
engaged
in
saving
the
liddy
had
left
the
house
for
the
purpose
of
lending
a
resolved
to
hive
the
bees
herself
if
possible
she
had
dressed
the
hive
with
herbs
and
honey
fetched
a
ladder
brush
and
crook
made
herself
impregnable
with
armour
of
leather
gloves
straw
hat
and
large
gauze
green
but
now
faded
to
snuff
ascended
a
dozen
rungs
of
the
ladder
at
once
she
heard
not
ten
yards
off
a
voice
that
was
beginning
to
have
a
strange
power
in
agitating
her
everdene
let
me
assist
you
you
should
not
attempt
such
a
thing
troy
was
just
opening
the
garden
gate
bathsheba
flung
down
the
brush
crook
and
empty
hive
pulled
the
skirt
of
her
dress
tightly
round
her
ankles
in
a
tremendous
flurry
and
as
well
as
she
could
slid
down
the
ladder
by
the
time
she
reached
the
bottom
troy
was
there
also
and
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
hive
fortunate
i
am
to
have
dropped
in
at
this
moment
exclaimed
the
sergeant
she
found
her
voice
in
a
minute
and
will
you
shake
them
in
for
me
she
asked
in
what
for
a
defiant
girl
was
a
faltering
way
though
for
a
timid
girl
it
would
have
seemed
a
brave
way
enough
i
said
troy
of
course
i
will
how
blooming
you
are
troy
flung
down
his
cane
and
put
his
foot
on
the
ladder
to
ascend
you
must
have
on
the
veil
and
gloves
or
be
stung
fearfully
yes
i
must
put
on
the
veil
and
gloves
will
you
kindly
show
me
how
to
fix
them
properly
you
must
have
the
hat
too
for
your
cap
has
no
brim
to
keep
the
veil
off
and
reach
your
hat
too
by
all
so
a
whimsical
fate
ordered
that
her
hat
should
be
taken
and
all
placed
upon
his
head
troy
tossing
his
own
into
a
gooseberry
bush
then
the
veil
had
to
be
tied
at
its
lower
edge
round
his
collar
and
the
gloves
put
on
him
he
looked
such
an
extraordinary
object
in
this
guise
that
flurried
as
she
was
she
could
not
avoid
laughing
outright
it
was
the
removal
of
yet
another
stake
from
the
palisade
of
cold
manners
which
had
kept
him
off
bathsheba
looked
on
from
the

whilst
he
was
busy
sweeping
and
shaking
the
bees
from
the
tree
holding
up
the
hive
with
the
other
hand
for
them
to
fall
into
she
made
use
of
an
unobserved
minute
whilst
his
attention
was
absorbed
in
the
operation
to
arrange
her
plumes
a
little
he
came
down
holding
the

at
length
behind
which
trailed
a
cloud
of
bees
my
life
said
troy
through
the
veil
up
this
hive
makes
arm
ache
worse
than
a
week
of
when
the
manœuvre
was
complete
he
approached
her
you
be
good
enough
to
untie
me
and
let
me
out
i
am
nearly
stifled
inside
this
silk
to
hide
her
embarrassment
during
the
unwonted
process
of
untying
the
string
about
his
neck
she
said
have
never
seen
that
you
spoke
would
you
like
to
said
troy
bathsheba
hesitated
she
had
heard
wondrous
reports
from
time
to
time
by
dwellers
in
weatherbury
who
had
by
chance
sojourned
awhile
in
casterbridge
near
the
barracks
of
this
strange
and
glorious
performance
the
men
and
boys
who
had
peeped
through
chinks
or
over
walls
into
the
returned
with
accounts
of
its
being
the
most
flashing
affair
conceivable
accoutrements
and
weapons
glistening
like
there
all
by
rule
and
compass
so
she
said
mildly
what
she
felt
strongly
i
should
like
to
see
it
very
so
you
shall
you
shall
see
me
go
through
how
me
with
a
care
to
see
that
it
must
be
a
real
i
know
and
i
have
no
sword
here
but
i
think
i
could
get
one
by
the
evening
now
will
you
do
this
troy
bent
over
her
and
murmured
some
suggestion
in
a
low
voice
no
indeed
said
bathsheba
blushing
you
very
much
but
i
on
any
you
might
nobody
would
she
shook
her
head
but
with
a
weakened
negation
i
were
to
she
said
must
bring
liddy
too
might
i
not
troy
looked
far
away
see
why
you
want
to
bring
her
he
said
coldly
an
unconscious
look
of
assent
in
eyes
betrayed
that
something
more
than
his
coldness
had
made
her
also
feel
that
liddy
would
be
superfluous
in
the
suggested
scene
she
had
felt
it
even
whilst
making
the
proposal
i
bring
come
but
only
for
a
very
short
time
she
added
very
short
will
not
take
five
minutes

the
hollow
amid
the
ferns
the
hill
opposite
dwelling
extended
a
mile
off
into
an
uncultivated
tract
of
land
dotted
at
this
season
with
tall
thickets
of
brake
fern
plump
and
diaphanous
from
recent
rapid
growth
and
radiant
in
hues
of
clear
and
untainted
green
at
eight
this
midsummer
evening
whilst
the
bristling
ball
of
gold
in
the
west
still
swept
the
tips
of
the
ferns
with
its
long
luxuriant
rays
a
soft
of
garments
might
have
been
heard
among
them
and
bathsheba
appeared
in
their
midst
their
soft
feathery
arms
caressing
her
up
to
her
shoulders
she
paused
turned
went
back
over
the
hill
and
to
her
own
door
whence
she
cast
a
farewell
glance
upon
the
spot
she
had
just
left
having
resolved
not
to
remain
near
the
place
after
all
she
saw
a
dim
spot
of
artificial
red
moving
round
the
shoulder
of
the
rise
it
disappeared
on
the
other
side
she
waited
one
of
disappointment
at
her
of
a
promised
engagement
till
she
again
ran
along
the
field
clambered
over
the
bank
and
followed
the
original
direction
she
was
now
literally
trembling
and
panting
at
this
her
temerity
in
such
an
errant
undertaking
her
breath
came
and
went
quickly
and
her
eyes
shone
with
an
infrequent
light
yet
go
she
must
she
reached
the
verge
of
a
pit
in
the
middle
of
the
ferns
troy
stood
in
the
bottom
looking
up
towards
her
heard
you
rustling
through
the
fern
before
i
saw
you
he
said
coming
up
and
giving
her
his
hand
to
help
her
down
the
slope
the
pit
was
a
concave
naturally
formed
with
a
top
diameter
of
about
thirty
feet
and
shallow
enough
to
allow
the
sunshine
to
reach
their
heads
standing
in
the
centre
the
sky
overhead
was
met
by
a
circular
horizon
of
fern
this
grew
nearly
to
the
bottom
of
the
slope
and
then
abruptly
ceased
the
middle
within
the
belt
of
verdure
was
floored
with
a
thick
flossy
carpet
of
moss
and
grass
intermingled
so
yielding
that
the
foot
was
within
it
said
troy
producing
the
sword
which
as
he
raised
it
into
the
sunlight
gleamed
a
sort
of
greeting
like
a
living
thing
we
have
four
right
and
four
left
cuts
four
right
and
four
left
thrusts
infantry
cuts
and
guards
are
more
interesting
than
ours
to
my
mind
but
they
are
not
so
swashing
they
have
seven
cuts
and
three
thrusts
so
much
as
a
preliminary
well
next
our
cut
one
is
as
if
you
were
sowing
your
bathsheba
saw
a
sort
of
rainbow
upside
down
in
the
air
and
arm
was
still
again
two
as
if
you
were
three
as
if
you
were
four
as
if
you
were
that
way
then
the
same
on
the
left
the
thrusts
are
these
one
two
three
four
right
one
two
three
four
he
repeated
them
again
he
said
she
hurriedly
interrupted
rather
not
though
i
mind
your
twos
and
fours
but
your
ones
and
threes
are
terrible
well
let
you
off
the
ones
and
threes
next
cuts
points
and
guards
troy
duly
exhibited
them
pursuing
practice
in
this
he
gave
the
movements
as
before
those
are
the
stereotyped
forms
the
infantry
have
two
most
diabolical
upward
cuts
which
we
are
too
humane
to
use
like
murderous
and
bloodthirsty
are
rather
deathly
now
be
more
interesting
and
let
you
see
some
loose
all
the
cuts
and
points
infantry
and
cavalry
quicker
than
lightning
and
as
just
enough
rule
to
regulate
instinct
and
yet
not
to
fetter
it
you
are
my
antagonist
with
this
difference
from
real
warfare
that
i
shall
miss
you
every
time
by
one
breadth
or
perhaps
two
mind
you
flinch
whatever
you
be
sure
not
to
she
said
invincibly
he
pointed
to
about
a
yard
in
front
of
him
adventurous
spirit
was
beginning
to
find
some
grains
of
relish
in
these
highly
novel
proceedings
she
took
up
her
position
as
directed
facing
troy
just
to
learn
whether
you
have
pluck
enough
to
let
me
do
what
i
wish
give
you
a
preliminary
he
flourished
the
sword
by
way
of
introduction
number
two
and
the
next
thing
of
which
she
was
conscious
was
that
the
point
and
blade
of
the
sword
were
darting
with
a
gleam
towards
her
left
side
just
above
her
hip
then
of
their
reappearance
on
her
right
side
emerging
as
it
were
from
between
her
ribs
having
apparently
passed
through
her
body
the
third
item
of
consciousness
was
that
of
seeing
the
same
sword
perfectly
clean
and
free
from
blood
held
vertically
in
hand
in
the
position
technically
called
all
was
as
quick
as
electricity
she
cried
out
in
affright
pressing
her
hand
to
her
side
you
run
me
through
you
have
not
whatever
have
you
done
have
not
touched
you
said
troy
quietly
was
mere
sleight
of
hand
the
sword
passed
behind
you
now
you
are
not
afraid
are
you
because
if
you
are
i
perform
i
give
my
word
that
i
will
not
only
not
hurt
you
but
not
once
touch
think
i
am
afraid
you
are
quite
sure
you
will
not
hurt
me
the
sword
very
sharp
stand
as
still
as
a
statue
now
in
an
instant
the
atmosphere
was
transformed
to
eyes
beams
of
light
caught
from
the
low
rays
above
around
in
front
of
her
shut
out
earth
and
emitted
in
the
marvellous
evolutions
of
reflecting
blade
which
seemed
everywhere
at
once
and
yet
nowhere
specially
these
circling
gleams
were
accompanied
by
a
keen
rush
that
was
almost
a
springing
from
all
sides
of
her
at
once
in
short
she
was
enclosed
in
a
firmament
of
light
and
of
sharp
hisses
resembling
a
of
meteors
close
at
hand
never
since
the
broadsword
became
the
national
weapon
had
there
been
more
dexterity
shown
in
its
management
than
by
the
hands
of
sergeant
troy
and
never
had
he
been
in
such
splendid
temper
for
the
performance
as
now
in
the
evening
sunshine
among
the
ferns
with
bathsheba
it
may
safely
be
asserted
with
respect
to
the
closeness
of
his
cuts
that
had
it
been
possible
for
the
edge
of
the
sword
to
leave
in
the
air
a
permanent
substance
wherever
it
flew
past
the
space
left
untouched
would
have
been
almost
a
mould
of
figure
behind
the
luminous
streams
of
this
she
could
see
the
hue
of
sword
arm
spread
in
a
scarlet
haze
over
the
space
covered
by
its
motions
like
a
twanged
harpstring
and
behind
all
troy
himself
mostly
facing
her
sometimes
to
show
the
rear
cuts
half
turned
away
his
eye
nevertheless
always
keenly
measuring
her
breadth
and
outline
and
his
lips
tightly
closed
in
sustained
effort
next
his
movements
lapsed
slower
and
she
could
see
them
individually
the
hissing
of
the
sword
had
ceased
and
he
stopped
entirely
outer
loose
lock
of
hair
wants
tidying
he
said
before
she
had
moved
or
spoken
do
it
for
an
arc
of
silver
shone
on
her
right
side
the
sword
had
descended
the
lock
dropped
to
the
ground
borne
said
troy
flinch
a
thickness
wonderful
in
a
woman
was
because
i
expect
it
oh
you
have
spoilt
my
hair
once
i
am
afraid
of
i
am
she
cried
touch
you
at
even
your
hair
i
am
only
going
to
kill
that
caterpillar
settling
on
you
now
still
it
appeared
that
a
caterpillar
had
come
from
the
fern
and
chosen
the
front
of
her
bodice
as
his
resting
place
she
saw
the
point
glisten
towards
her
bosom
and
seemingly
enter
it
bathsheba
closed
her
eyes
in
the
full
persuasion
that
she
was
killed
at
last
however
feeling
just
as
usual
she
opened
them
again
it
is
look
said
the
sergeant
holding
his
sword
before
her
eyes
the
caterpillar
was
spitted
upon
its
point
it
is
magic
said
bathsheba
amazed
i
merely
gave
point
to
your
bosom
where
the
caterpillar
was
and
instead
of
running
you
through
checked
the
extension
a
thousandth
of
an
inch
short
of
your
how
could
you
chop
off
a
curl
of
my
hair
with
a
sword
that
has
no
edge
edge
this
sword
will
shave
like
a
razor
look
he
touched
the
palm
of
his
hand
with
the
blade
and
then
lifting
it
showed
her
a
thin
shaving
of
dangling
therefrom
you
said
before
beginning
that
it
was
blunt
and
cut
me
was
to
get
you
to
stand
still
and
so
make
sure
of
your
safety
the
risk
of
injuring
you
through
your
moving
was
too
great
not
to
force
me
to
tell
you
a
fib
to
escape
she
shuddered
have
been
within
an
inch
of
my
life
and
know
it
precisely
speaking
you
have
been
within
half
an
inch
of
being
pared
alive
two
hundred
and
cruel
of
you
have
been
perfectly
safe
nevertheless
my
sword
never
and
troy
returned
the
weapon
to
the
scabbard
bathsheba
overcome
by
a
hundred
tumultuous
feelings
resulting
from
the
scene
abstractedly
sat
down
on
a
tuft
of
heather
must
leave
you
now
said
troy
softly
venture
to
take
and
keep
this
in
remembrance
of
she
saw
him
stoop
to
the
grass
pick
up
the
winding
lock
which
he
had
severed
from
her
manifold
tresses
twist
it
round
his
fingers
unfasten
a
button
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
and
carefully
put
it
inside
she
felt
powerless
to
withstand
or
deny
him
he
was
altogether
too
much
for
her
and
bathsheba
seemed
as
one
who
facing
a
reviving
wind
finds
it
blow
so
strongly
that
it
stops
the
breath
he
drew
near
and
said
must
be
leaving
he
drew
nearer
still
a
minute
later
and
she
saw
his
scarlet
form
disappear
amid
the
ferny
thicket
almost
in
a
flash
like
a
brand
swiftly
waved
that
interval
had
brought
the
blood
beating
into
her
face
set
her
stinging
as
if
aflame
to
the
very
hollows
of
her
feet
and
enlarged
emotion
to
a
compass
which
quite
swamped
thought
it
had
brought
upon
her
a
stroke
resulting
as
did
that
of
moses
in
horeb
in
a
liquid
a
stream
of
tears
she
felt
like
one
who
has
sinned
a
great
sin
the
circumstance
had
been
the
gentle
dip
of
mouth
downwards
upon
her
own
he
had
kissed
her
chapter
xxix
particulars
of
a
twilight
walk
we
now
see
the
element
of
folly
distinctly
mingling
with
the
many
varying
particulars
which
made
up
the
character
of
bathsheba
everdene
it
was
almost
foreign
to
her
intrinsic
nature
introduced
as
lymph
on
the
dart
of
eros
it
eventually
permeated
and
coloured
her
whole
constitution
bathsheba
though
she
had
too
much
understanding
to
be
entirely
governed
by
her
womanliness
had
too
much
womanliness
to
use
her
understanding
to
the
best
advantage
perhaps
in
no
minor
point
does
woman
astonish
her
helpmate
more
than
in
the
strange
power
she
possesses
of
believing
cajoleries
that
she
knows
to
be
indeed
in
that
of
being
utterly
sceptical
on
strictures
that
she
knows
to
be
true
bathsheba
loved
troy
in
the
way
that
only
women
love
when
they
abandon
their
when
a
strong
woman
recklessly
throws
away
her
strength
she
is
worse
than
a
weak
woman
who
has
never
had
any
strength
to
throw
away
one
source
of
her
inadequacy
is
the
novelty
of
the
occasion
she
has
never
had
practice
in
making
the
best
of
such
a
condition
weakness
is
doubly
weak
by
being
new
bathsheba
was
not
conscious
of
guile
in
this
matter
though
in
one
sense
a
woman
of
the
world
it
was
after
all
that
world
of
daylight
coteries
and
green
carpets
wherein
cattle
form
the
passing
crowd
and
winds
the
busy
hum
where
a
quiet
family
of
rabbits
or
hares
lives
on
the
other
side
of
your
where
your
neighbour
is
everybody
in
the
tything
and
where
calculation
is
confined
to
of
the
fabricated
tastes
of
good
fashionable
society
she
knew
but
little
and
of
the
formulated
of
bad
nothing
at
all
had
her
utmost
thoughts
in
this
direction
been
distinctly
worded
and
by
herself
they
never
were
they
would
only
have
amounted
to
such
a
matter
as
that
she
felt
her
impulses
to
be
pleasanter
guides
than
her
discretion
her
love
was
entire
as
a
and
though
warm
as
summer
it
was
fresh
as
spring
her
culpability
lay
in
her
making
no
attempt
to
control
feeling
by
subtle
and
careful
inquiry
into
consequences
she
could
show
others
the
steep
and
thorny
way
but
not
her
own
and
deformities
lay
deep
down
from
a
vision
whilst
his
embellishments
were
upon
the
very
surface
thus
contrasting
with
homely
oak
whose
defects
were
patent
to
the
blindest
and
whose
virtues
were
as
metals
in
a
mine
the
difference
between
love
and
respect
was
markedly
shown
in
her
conduct
bathsheba
had
spoken
of
her
interest
in
boldwood
with
the
greatest
freedom
to
liddy
but
she
had
only
communed
with
her
own
heart
concerning
troy
all
this
infatuation
gabriel
saw
and
was
troubled
thereby
from
the
time
of
his
daily
journey
to
the
time
of
his
return
and
on
to
the
small
hours
of
many
a
night
that
he
was
not
beloved
had
hitherto
been
his
great
sorrow
that
bathsheba
was
getting
into
the
toils
was
now
a
sorrow
greater
than
the
first
and
one
which
nearly
obscured
it
it
was
a
result
which
paralleled
the
observation
of
hippocrates
concerning
physical
pains
that
is
a
noble
though
perhaps
an
unpromising
love
which
not
even
the
fear
of
breeding
aversion
in
the
bosom
of
the
one
beloved
can
deter
from
combating
his
or
her
errors
oak
determined
to
speak
to
his
mistress
he
would
base
his
appeal
on
what
he
considered
her
unfair
treatment
of
farmer
boldwood
now
absent
from
home
an
opportunity
occurred
one
evening
when
she
had
gone
for
a
short
walk
by
a
path
through
the
neighbouring
cornfields
it
was
dusk
when
oak
who
had
not
been
far
that
day
took
the
same
path
and
met
her
returning
quite
pensively
as
he
thought
the
wheat
was
now
tall
and
the
path
was
narrow
thus
the
way
was
quite
a
sunken
groove
between
the
embowing
thicket
on
either
side
two
persons
could
not
walk
abreast
without
damaging
the
crop
and
oak
stood
aside
to
let
her
pass
is
it
gabriel
she
said
are
taking
a
walk
too
thought
i
would
come
to
meet
you
as
it
is
rather
late
said
oak
turning
and
following
at
her
heels
when
she
had
brushed
somewhat
quickly
by
him
you
indeed
but
i
am
not
very
no
but
there
are
bad
characters
never
meet
now
oak
with
marvellous
ingenuity
had
been
going
to
introduce
the
gallant
sergeant
through
the
channel
of
but
all
at
once
the
scheme
broke
down
it
suddenly
occurring
to
him
that
this
was
rather
a
clumsy
way
and
too
barefaced
to
begin
with
he
tried
another
preamble
as
the
man
who
would
naturally
come
to
meet
you
is
away
from
home
mean
farmer
thinks
i
go
he
said
she
walked
on
without
turning
her
head
and
for
many
steps
nothing
further
was
heard
from
her
quarter
than
the
rustle
of
her
dress
against
the
heavy
then
she
resumed
rather
quite
understand
what
you
meant
by
saying
that
boldwood
would
naturally
come
to
meet
meant
on
account
of
the
wedding
which
they
say
is
likely
to
take
place
between
you
and
him
miss
forgive
my
speaking
say
what
is
not
she
returned
quickly
marriage
is
likely
to
take
place
between
gabriel
now
put
forth
his
unobscured
opinion
for
the
moment
had
come
miss
everdene
he
said
aside
what
people
say
i
never
in
my
life
saw
any
courting
if
his
is
not
a
courting
of
bathsheba
would
probably
have
terminated
the
conversation
there
and
then
by
flatly
forbidding
the
subject
had
not
her
conscious
weakness
of
position
allured
her
to
palter
and
argue
in
endeavours
to
better
it
this
subject
has
been
mentioned
she
said
very
emphatically
am
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
clearing
up
a
mistake
which
is
very
common
and
very
provoking
i
definitely
promise
boldwood
anything
i
have
never
cared
for
him
i
respect
him
and
he
has
urged
me
to
marry
him
but
i
have
given
him
no
distinct
answer
as
soon
as
he
returns
i
shall
do
so
and
the
answer
will
be
that
i
can
not
think
of
marrying
are
full
of
mistakes
other
day
they
said
you
were
trifling
with
him
and
you
almost
proved
that
you
were
not
lately
they
have
said
that
you
be
not
and
you
straightway
begin
to
i
am
i
suppose
you
i
hope
they
speak
the
do
but
wrongly
applied
i
trifle
with
him
but
then
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
oak
was
unfortunately
led
on
to
speak
of
rival
in
a
wrong
tone
to
her
after
all
wish
you
had
never
met
that
young
sergeant
troy
miss
he
sighed
steps
became
faintly
spasmodic
she
asked
is
not
good
enough
for
any
one
tell
you
to
speak
to
me
like
this
at
it
appears
to
me
that
sergeant
troy
does
not
concern
us
here
she
said
intractably
i
must
say
that
sergeant
troy
is
an
educated
man
and
quite
worthy
of
any
woman
he
is
well
being
higher
in
learning
and
birth
than
the
ruck
soldiers
is
anything
but
a
proof
of
his
worth
it
his
course
to
be
can
not
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
our
conversation
course
is
not
by
any
means
downward
and
his
superiority
a
proof
of
his
worth
believe
him
to
have
no
conscience
at
all
and
i
can
not
help
begging
you
miss
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
listen
to
me
this
this
once
i
say
such
a
bad
man
as
i
have
pray
to
god
he
is
not
but
since
we
exactly
know
what
he
is
why
not
behave
as
if
he
be
bad
simply
for
your
own
safety
trust
him
mistress
i
ask
you
not
to
trust
him
pray
like
soldiers
but
this
one
i
do
not
like
he
said
sturdily
cleverness
in
his
calling
may
have
tempted
him
astray
and
what
is
mirth
to
the
neighbours
is
ruin
to
the
woman
when
he
tries
to
talk
to
again
why
not
turn
away
with
a
short
and
when
you
see
him
coming
one
way
turn
the
other
when
he
says
anything
laughable
fail
to
see
the
point
and
smile
and
speak
of
him
before
those
who
will
report
your
talk
as
fantastical
man
or
sergeant
man
of
a
family
that
has
come
to
the
be
unmannerly
towards
en
but
and
so
get
rid
of
the
no
christmas
robin
detained
by
a
ever
pulsed
as
did
bathsheba
now
say
it
become
you
to
talk
about
him
why
he
should
be
mentioned
passes
me
quite
she
exclaimed
desperately
know
this
he
is
a
thoroughly
conscientious
sometimes
even
to
always
speaking
his
mind
about
you
plain
to
your
face
is
as
good
as
anybody
in
this
parish
he
is
very
particular
too
about
going
to
he
is
am
afeard
nobody
saw
him
there
i
never
did
reason
of
that
is
she
said
eagerly
he
goes
in
privately
by
the
old
tower
door
just
when
the
service
commences
and
sits
at
the
back
of
the
gallery
he
told
me
this
supreme
instance
of
goodness
fell
upon
gabriel
ears
like
the
thirteenth
stroke
of
crazy
clock
it
was
not
only
received
with
utter
incredulity
as
regarded
itself
but
threw
a
doubt
on
all
the
assurances
that
had
preceded
it
oak
was
grieved
to
find
how
entirely
she
trusted
him
he
brimmed
with
deep
feeling
as
he
replied
in
a
steady
voice
the
steadiness
of
which
was
spoilt
by
the
palpableness
of
his
great
effort
to
keep
it
so
know
mistress
that
i
love
you
and
shall
love
you
always
i
only
mention
this
to
bring
to
your
mind
that
at
any
rate
i
would
wish
to
do
you
no
harm
beyond
that
i
put
it
aside
i
have
lost
in
the
race
for
money
and
good
things
and
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
pretend
to
now
i
am
poor
and
you
have
got
altogether
above
me
but
bathsheba
dear
mistress
this
i
beg
you
to
both
to
keep
yourself
well
honoured
among
the
workfolk
and
in
common
generosity
to
an
honourable
man
who
loves
you
as
well
as
i
you
should
be
more
discreet
in
your
bearing
towards
this
she
exclaimed
in
a
choking
voice
ye
not
more
to
me
than
my
own
affairs
and
even
life
he
went
on
listen
to
me
i
am
six
years
older
than
you
and
boldwood
is
ten
years
older
than
i
and
do
beg
of
to
consider
before
it
is
too
safe
you
would
be
in
his
hands
allusion
to
his
own
love
for
her
lessened
to
some
extent
her
anger
at
his
interference
but
she
could
not
really
forgive
him
for
letting
his
wish
to
marry
her
be
eclipsed
by
his
wish
to
do
her
good
any
more
than
for
his
slighting
treatment
of
troy
wish
you
to
go
elsewhere
she
commanded
a
paleness
of
face
invisible
to
the
eye
being
suggested
by
the
trembling
words
not
remain
on
this
farm
any
longer
i
want
beg
you
to
go
nonsense
said
oak
calmly
is
the
second
time
you
have
pretended
to
dismiss
me
and
the
use
it
you
shall
go
lecturing
i
will
not
hear
i
am
mistress
folly
will
you
say
next
treating
me
like
dick
tom
and
harry
when
you
know
that
a
short
time
ago
my
position
was
as
good
as
yours
upon
my
life
bathsheba
it
is
too
barefaced
you
know
too
that
i
go
without
putting
things
in
such
a
strait
as
you
get
out
of
i
tell
when
unless
indeed
promise
to
have
an
understanding
man
as
bailiff
or
manager
or
something
go
at
once
if
promise
shall
have
no
bailiff
i
shall
continue
to
be
my
own
manager
she
said
decisively
well
then
you
should
be
thankful
to
me
for
biding
how
would
the
farm
go
on
with
nobody
to
mind
it
but
a
woman
but
mind
this
i
wish
to
feel
you
owe
me
anything
not
i
what
i
do
i
do
sometimes
i
say
i
should
be
as
glad
as
a
bird
to
leave
the
suppose
content
to
be
a
nobody
i
was
made
for
better
things
however
i
like
to
see
your
concerns
going
to
ruin
as
they
must
if
you
keep
in
this
mind
i
hate
taking
my
own
measure
so
plain
but
upon
my
life
your
provoking
ways
make
a
man
say
what
he
dream
of
at
other
times
i
own
to
being
rather
interfering
but
you
know
well
enough
how
it
is
and
who
she
is
that
i
like
too
well
and
feel
too
much
like
a
fool
about
to
be
civil
to
her
it
is
more
than
probable
that
she
privately
and
unconsciously
respected
him
a
little
for
this
grim
fidelity
which
had
been
shown
in
his
tone
even
more
than
in
his
words
at
any
rate
she
murmured
something
to
the
effect
that
he
might
stay
if
he
wished
she
said
more
distinctly
you
leave
me
alone
now
i
order
it
as
a
ask
it
as
a
woman
and
i
expect
you
not
to
be
so
uncourteous
as
to
i
will
miss
everdene
said
gabriel
gently
he
wondered
that
the
request
should
have
come
at
this
moment
for
the
strife
was
over
and
they
were
on
a
most
desolate
hill
far
from
every
human
habitation
and
the
hour
was
getting
late
he
stood
still
and
allowed
her
to
get
far
ahead
of
him
till
he
could
only
see
her
form
upon
the
sky
a
distressing
explanation
of
this
anxiety
to
be
rid
of
him
at
that
point
now
ensued
a
figure
apparently
rose
from
the
earth
beside
her
the
shape
beyond
all
doubt
was
oak
would
not
be
even
a
possible
listener
and
at
once
turned
back
till
a
good
two
hundred
yards
were
between
the
lovers
and
himself
gabriel
went
home
by
way
of
the
churchyard
in
passing
the
tower
he
thought
of
what
she
had
said
about
the
virtuous
habit
of
entering
the
church
unperceived
at
the
beginning
of
service
believing
that
the
little
gallery
door
alluded
to
was
quite
disused
he
ascended
the
external
flight
of
steps
at
the
top
of
which
it
stood
and
examined
it
the
pale
lustre
yet
hanging
in
the
heaven
was
sufficient
to
show
that
a
sprig
of
ivy
had
grown
from
the
wall
across
the
door
to
a
length
of
more
than
a
foot
delicately
tying
the
panel
to
the
stone
jamb
it
was
a
decisive
proof
that
the
door
had
not
been
opened
at
least
since
troy
came
back
to
weatherbury
chapter
xxx
hot
cheeks
and
tearful
eyes
half
an
hour
later
bathsheba
entered
her
own
house
there
burnt
upon
her
face
when
she
met
the
light
of
the
candles
the
flush
and
excitement
which
were
little
less
than
chronic
with
her
now
the
farewell
words
of
troy
who
had
accompanied
her
to
the
very
door
still
lingered
in
her
ears
he
had
bidden
her
adieu
for
two
days
which
were
so
he
stated
to
be
spent
at
bath
in
visiting
some
friends
he
had
also
kissed
her
a
second
time
it
is
only
fair
to
bathsheba
to
explain
here
a
little
fact
which
did
not
come
to
light
till
a
long
time
afterwards
that
presentation
of
himself
so
aptly
at
the
roadside
this
evening
was
not
by
any
distinctly
preconcerted
arrangement
he
had
had
forbidden
and
it
was
only
on
the
chance
of
his
still
coming
that
she
had
dismissed
oak
fearing
a
meeting
between
them
just
then
she
now
sank
down
into
a
chair
wild
and
perturbed
by
all
these
new
and
fevering
sequences
then
she
jumped
up
with
a
manner
of
decision
and
fetched
her
desk
from
a
side
table
in
three
minutes
without
pause
or
modification
she
had
written
a
letter
to
boldwood
at
his
address
beyond
casterbridge
saying
mildly
but
firmly
that
she
had
well
considered
the
whole
subject
he
had
brought
before
her
and
kindly
given
her
time
to
decide
upon
that
her
final
decision
was
that
she
could
not
marry
him
she
had
expressed
to
oak
an
intention
to
wait
till
boldwood
came
home
before
communicating
to
him
her
conclusive
reply
but
bathsheba
found
that
she
could
not
wait
it
was
impossible
to
send
this
letter
till
the
next
day
yet
to
quell
her
uneasiness
by
getting
it
out
of
her
hands
and
so
as
it
were
setting
the
act
in
motion
at
once
she
arose
to
take
it
to
any
one
of
the
women
who
might
be
in
the
kitchen
she
paused
in
the
passage
a
dialogue
was
going
on
in
the
kitchen
and
bathsheba
and
troy
were
the
subject
of
it
he
marry
her
gie
up
be
a
gallant
life
but
may
bring
some
trouble
between
the
say
i
wish
i
had
half
such
a
bathsheba
had
too
much
sense
to
mind
seriously
what
her
servitors
said
about
her
but
too
much
womanly
redundance
of
speech
to
leave
alone
what
was
said
till
it
died
the
natural
death
of
unminded
things
she
burst
in
upon
them
are
you
speaking
of
she
asked
there
was
a
pause
before
anybody
replied
at
last
liddy
said
frankly
was
passing

a
bit
of
a
word
about
yourself
thought
so
maryann
and
liddy

i
forbid
you

things

your
heart

very
world

wild
scamp
how
dare

my
face
i

no
right
to
hate
him

you

a
silly
woman
what
is
it
to
me
what
he
is

to
defend
his
good
name

mind
this
if

of
you
say
a
word
against
him

dismissed
instantly
she
flung
down
the
letter
and
surged
back
into
the
parlour
with
a
big
heart
and
tearful
eyes
liddy
following
her
miss
said
mild
liddy
looking
pitifully
into
face

sorry

mistook
you
so
i
did
think
you
cared
for
him
but

reckless
abandonment

grief

very
distraction

agony

though

let
it
out
to
somebody

is
wearing
me
away

enough
of
me
to
see
through
that
miserable
denial
of
mine
o
god
what
a
lie
it
was
heaven
and
my
love
forgive
me
and
you
know
that
a
woman

it
is
balanced
against
her
love

of
the
room

want

towards

off
pacing
from

to
door
and
back
again

liddy
frightened
at
unwonted
vehemence

if

rage
at

you
believe
you

at
all
my
poor
life
and
heart
how
weak
i

she
moaned
in
a
relaxed
desultory
way
heedless
of
presence
how
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
him
loving
is
misery
for
women
always
i
shall
never
forgive
god
for
making
me
a
woman
and
dearly
am
i
beginning
to
pay
for
the
honour
of
owning
a
pretty
she
freshened
and
turned
to
liddy
suddenly
this
lydia
smallbury
if
you
repeat
anywhere
a
single
word
of
what
i
have
said
to
you
inside
this
closed
door
never
trust
you
or
love
you
or
have
you
with
me
a
moment
a
moment
want
to
repeat
anything
said
liddy
with
womanly
dignity
of
a
diminutive
order
i
wish
to
stay
with
you
and
if
you
please
go
at
the
end
of
the
harvest
or
this
week
or
i
see
that
i
deserve
to
be
put
upon
and
stormed
at
for
nothing
concluded
the
small
woman
bigly
no
liddy
you
must
stay
said
bathsheba
dropping
from
haughtiness
to
entreaty
with
capricious
inconsequence
must
not
notice
my
being
in
a
taking
just
now
you
are
not
as
a
are
a
companion
to
me
dear
know
what
i
am
doing
since
this
miserable
ache
of
my
heart
has
weighted
and
worn
upon
me
so
what
shall
i
come
to
i
suppose
i
shall
get
further
and
further
into
troubles
i
wonder
sometimes
if
i
am
doomed
to
die
in
the
union
i
am
friendless
enough
god
knows
notice
anything
nor
will
i
leave
you
sobbed
liddy
impulsively
putting
up
her
lips
to
and
kissing
her
then
bathsheba
kissed
liddy
and
all
was
smooth
again
often
cry
do
i
lidd
but
you
have
made
tears
come
into
my
eyes
she
said
a
smile
shining
through
the
moisture
to
think
him
a
good
man
you
dear
liddy
will
miss
is
a
sort
of
steady
man
in
a
wild
way
you
know
better
than
to
be
as
some
are
wild
in
a
steady
way
i
am
afraid
how
i
am
and
promise
me
to
keep
my
liddy
and
do
not
let
them
know
that
i
have
been
crying
about
him
because
it
will
be
dreadful
for
me
and
no
good
to
him
poor
thing
head
himself
wring
it
from
me
mistress
if
a
mind
to
keep
anything
and
always
be
your
friend
replied
liddy
emphatically
at
the
same
time
bringing
a
few
more
tears
into
her
own
eyes
not
from
any
particular
necessity
but
from
an
artistic
sense
of
making
herself
in
keeping
with
the
remainder
of
the
picture
which
seems
to
influence
women
at
such
times
think
god
likes
us
to
be
good
friends
you
i
dear
miss
you
harry
me
and
storm
at
me
will
you
because
you
seem
to
swell
so
tall
as
a
lion
then
and
it
frightens
me
do
you
know
i
fancy
you
would
be
a
match
for
any
man
when
you
are
in
one
your
do
you
said
bathsheba
slightly
laughing
though
somewhat
seriously
alarmed
by
this
amazonian
picture
of
herself
hope
i
am
not
a
bold
sort
of
she
continued
with
some
anxiety
no
not
mannish
but
so
almighty
womanish
that
getting
on
that
way
sometimes
ah
miss
she
said
after
having
drawn
her
breath
very
sadly
in
and
sent
it
very
sadly
out
wish
i
had
half
your
failing
that
way
a
great
protection
to
a
poor
maid
in
these
days
chapter
xxxi
the
next
evening
bathsheba
with
the
idea
of
getting
out
of
the
way
of
boldwood
in
the
event
of
his
returning
to
answer
her
note
in
person
proceeded
to
fulfil
an
engagement
made
with
liddy
some
few
hours
earlier
companion
as
a
gauge
of
their
reconciliation
had
been
granted
a
holiday
to
visit
her
sister
who
was
married
to
a
thriving
hurdler
and
living
in
a
delightful
labyrinth
of
hazel
copse
not
far
beyond
yalbury
the
arrangement
was
that
miss
everdene
should
honour
them
by
coming
there
for
a
day
or
two
to
inspect
some
ingenious
contrivances
which
this
man
of
the
woods
had
introduced
into
his
wares
leaving
her
instructions
with
gabriel
and
maryann
that
they
were
to
see
everything
carefully
locked
up
for
the
night
she
went
out
of
the
house
just
at
the
close
of
a
timely
which
had
refined
the
air
and
daintily
bathed
the
coat
of
the
land
though
all
beneath
was
dry
as
ever
freshness
was
exhaled
in
an
essence
from
the
varied
contours
of
bank
and
hollow
as
if
the
earth
breathed
maiden
breath
and
the
pleased
birds
were
hymning
to
the
scene
before
her
among
the
clouds
there
was
a
contrast
in
the
shape
of
lairs
of
fierce
light
which
showed
themselves
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
hidden
sun
lingering
on
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
heavens
that
this
midsummer
season
allowed
she
had
walked
nearly
two
miles
of
her
journey
watching
how
the
day
was
retreating
and
thinking
how
the
time
of
deeds
was
quietly
melting
into
the
time
of
thought
to
give
place
in
its
turn
to
the
time
of
prayer
and
sleep
when
she
beheld
advancing
over
yalbury
hill
the
very
man
she
sought
so
anxiously
to
elude
boldwood
was
stepping
on
not
with
that
quiet
tread
of
reserved
strength
which
was
his
customary
gait
in
which
he
always
seemed
to
be
balancing
two
thoughts
his
manner
was
stunned
and
sluggish
now
boldwood
had
for
the
first
time
been
awakened
to
privileges
in
tergiversation
even
when
it
involves
another
possible
blight
that
bathsheba
was
a
firm
and
positive
girl
far
less
inconsequent
than
her
fellows
had
been
the
very
lung
of
his
hope
for
he
had
held
that
these
qualities
would
lead
her
to
adhere
to
a
straight
course
for
sake
and
accept
him
though
her
fancy
might
not
flood
him
with
the
iridescent
hues
of
uncritical
love
but
the
argument
now
came
back
as
sorry
gleams
from
a
broken
mirror
the
discovery
was
no
less
a
scourge
than
a
surprise
he
came
on
looking
upon
the
ground
and
did
not
see
bathsheba
till
they
were
less
than
a
throw
apart
he
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
her
and
his
changed
appearance
sufficiently
denoted
to
her
the
depth
and
strength
of
the
feelings
paralyzed
by
her
letter
is
it
you
boldwood
she
faltered
a
guilty
warmth
pulsing
in
her
face
those
who
have
the
power
of
reproaching
in
silence
may
find
it
a
means
more
effective
than
words
there
are
accents
in
the
eye
which
are
not
on
the
tongue
and
more
tales
come
from
pale
lips
than
can
enter
an
ear
it
is
both
the
grandeur
and
the
pain
of
the
remoter
moods
that
they
avoid
the
pathway
of
sound
look
was
unanswerable
seeing
she
turned
a
little
aside
he
said
are
you
afraid
of
me
should
you
say
that
said
bathsheba
fancied
you
looked
so
said
he
it
is
most
strange
because
of
its
contrast
with
my
feeling
for
she
regained
fixed
her
eyes
calmly
and
waited
know
what
that
feeling
is
continued
boldwood
deliberately
thing
strong
as
death
no
dismissal
by
a
hasty
letter
affects
wish
you
did
not
feel
so
strongly
about
me
she
murmured
is
generous
of
you
and
more
than
i
deserve
but
i
must
not
hear
it
it
what
do
you
think
i
have
to
say
then
i
am
not
to
marry
you
and
enough
your
letter
was
excellently
plain
i
want
you
to
hear
bathsheba
was
unable
to
direct
her
will
into
any
definite
groove
for
freeing
herself
from
this
fearfully
awkward
position
she
confusedly
said
evening
and
was
moving
on
boldwood
walked
up
to
her
heavily
and
dully
it
final
indeed
it
pity
upon
me
boldwood
burst
out
sake
am
come
to
that
low
lowest
ask
a
woman
for
pity
still
she
is
is
bathsheba
commanded
herself
well
but
she
could
hardly
get
a
clear
voice
for
what
came
instinctively
to
her
lips
is
little
honour
to
the
woman
in
that
it
was
only
whispered
for
something
unutterably
mournful
no
less
than
distressing
in
this
spectacle
of
a
man
showing
himself
to
be
so
entirely
the
vane
of
a
passion
enervated
the
feminine
instinct
for
punctilios
am
beyond
myself
about
this
and
am
mad
he
said
am
no
stoic
at
all
to
be
supplicating
here
but
i
do
supplicate
to
you
i
wish
you
knew
what
is
in
me
of
devotion
to
you
but
it
is
impossible
that
in
bare
human
mercy
to
a
lonely
man
throw
me
off
now
throw
you
how
can
i
i
never
had
in
her
sense
that
she
had
never
loved
him
she
forgot
for
a
moment
her
thoughtless
angle
on
that
day
in
february
there
was
a
time
when
you
turned
to
me
before
i
thought
of
you
i
reproach
you
for
even
now
i
feel
that
the
ignorant
and
cold
darkness
that
i
should
have
lived
in
if
you
had
not
attracted
me
by
that
you
call
have
been
worse
than
my
knowledge
of
you
though
it
has
brought
this
misery
but
i
say
there
was
a
time
when
i
knew
nothing
of
you
and
cared
nothing
for
you
and
yet
you
drew
me
on
and
if
you
say
you
gave
me
no
encouragement
i
can
not
but
contradict
you
call
encouragement
was
the
childish
game
of
an
idle
minute
i
have
bitterly
repented
of
bitterly
and
in
tears
can
you
still
go
on
reminding
me
accuse
you
of
deplore
it
i
took
for
earnest
what
you
insist
was
jest
and
now
this
that
i
pray
to
be
jest
you
say
is
awful
wretched
earnest
our
moods
meet
at
wrong
places
i
wish
your
feeling
was
more
like
mine
or
my
feeling
more
like
yours
oh
could
i
but
have
foreseen
the
torture
that
trifling
trick
was
going
to
lead
me
into
how
i
should
have
cursed
you
but
only
having
been
able
to
see
it
since
i
can
not
do
that
for
i
love
you
too
well
but
it
is
weak
idle
drivelling
to
go
on
like
this
bathsheba
you
are
the
first
woman
of
any
shade
or
nature
that
i
have
ever
looked
at
to
love
and
it
is
the
having
been
so
near
claiming
you
for
my
own
that
makes
this
denial
so
hard
to
bear
how
nearly
you
promised
me
but
i
speak
now
to
move
your
heart
and
make
you
grieve
because
of
my
pain
it
is
no
use
that
i
must
bear
it
my
pain
would
get
no
less
by
paining
i
do
pity
so
deeply
she
earnestly
said
no
such
no
such
thing
your
dear
love
bathsheba
is
such
a
vast
thing
beside
your
pity
that
the
loss
of
your
pity
as
well
as
your
love
is
no
great
addition
to
my
sorrow
nor
does
the
gain
of
your
pity
make
it
sensibly
less
o
dearly
you
spoke
to
me
behind
the
at
the
and
in
the
barn
at
the
shearing
and
that
dearest
last
time
in
the
evening
at
your
home
where
are
your
pleasant
words
all
earnest
hope
to
be
able
to
love
me
where
is
your
firm
conviction
that
you
would
get
to
care
for
me
very
much
really
forgotten
she
checked
emotion
looked
him
quietly
and
clearly
in
the
face
and
said
in
her
low
firm
voice
boldwood
i
promised
you
nothing
would
you
have
had
me
a
woman
of
clay
when
you
paid
me
that
furthest
highest
compliment
a
man
can
pay
a
her
he
loves
her
i
was
bound
to
show
some
feeling
if
i
would
not
be
a
graceless
shrew
yet
each
of
those
pleasures
was
just
for
the
day
just
for
the
pleasure
how
was
i
to
know
that
what
is
a
pastime
to
all
other
men
was
death
to
you
have
reason
do
and
think
more
kindly
of
me
never
mind
mind
one
thing
is
sure
you
were
all
but
mine
and
now
you
are
not
nearly
mine
everything
is
changed
and
that
by
you
alone
remember
you
were
nothing
to
me
once
and
i
was
contented
you
are
now
nothing
to
me
again
and
how
different
the
second
nothing
is
from
the
first
would
to
god
you
had
never
taken
me
up
since
it
was
only
to
throw
me
down
bathsheba
in
spite
of
her
mettle
began
to
feel
unmistakable
signs
that
she
was
inherently
the
weaker
vessel
she
strove
miserably
against
this
femininity
which
would
insist
upon
supplying
unbidden
emotions
in
stronger
and
stronger
current
she
had
tried
to
elude
agitation
by
fixing
her
mind
on
the
trees
sky
any
trivial
object
before
her
eyes
whilst
his
reproaches
fell
but
ingenuity
could
not
save
her
now
did
not
take
you
i
did
not
she
answered
as
heroically
as
she
could
be
in
this
mood
with
me
i
can
endure
being
told
i
am
in
the
wrong
if
you
will
only
tell
it
me
gently
o
sir
will
you
not
kindly
forgive
me
and
look
at
it
cheerfully
can
a
man
fooled
to
utter
find
a
reason
for
being
merry
if
i
have
lost
how
can
i
be
as
if
i
had
won
heavens
you
must
be
heartless
quite
had
i
known
what
a
fearfully
bitter
sweet
this
was
to
be
how
i
would
have
avoided
you
and
never
seen
you
and
been
deaf
of
you
i
tell
you
all
this
but
what
do
you
care
you
she
returned
silent
and
weak
denials
to
his
charges
and
swayed
her
head
desperately
as
if
to
thrust
away
the
words
as
they
came
showering
about
her
ears
from
the
lips
of
the
trembling
man
in
the
climax
of
life
with
his
bronzed
roman
face
and
fine
frame
dearest
i
am
wavering
even
now
between
the
two
opposites
of
recklessly
renouncing
you
and
labouring
humbly
for
you
again
forget
that
you
have
said
no
and
let
it
be
as
it
was
say
bathsheba
that
you
only
wrote
that
refusal
to
me
in
say
it
to
me
would
be
untrue
and
painful
to
both
of
us
you
overrate
my
capacity
for
love
i
possess
half
the
warmth
of
nature
you
believe
me
to
have
an
unprotected
childhood
in
a
cold
world
has
beaten
gentleness
out
of
he
immediately
said
with
more
resentment
may
be
true
somewhat
but
ah
miss
everdene
it
do
as
a
reason
you
are
not
the
cold
woman
you
would
have
me
believe
no
no
it
because
you
have
no
feeling
in
you
that
you
love
me
you
naturally
would
have
me
think
would
hide
from
me
that
you
have
a
burning
heart
like
mine
you
have
love
enough
but
it
is
turned
into
a
new
channel
i
know
the
swift
music
of
her
heart
became
hubbub
now
and
she
throbbed
to
extremity
he
was
coming
to
troy
he
did
then
know
what
had
occurred
and
the
name
fell
from
his
lips
the
next
moment
did
troy
not
leave
my
treasure
alone
he
asked
fiercely
i
had
no
thought
of
injuring
him
why
did
he
force
himself
upon
your
notice
before
he
worried
you
your
inclination
was
to
have
me
when
next
i
should
have
come
to
you
your
answer
would
have
been
yes
can
you
deny
ask
can
you
deny
it
she
delayed
the
reply
but
was
too
honest
to
withhold
it
can
not
she
whispered
know
you
can
not
but
he
stole
in
in
my
absence
and
robbed
me
why
he
win
you
away
before
when
nobody
would
have
been
grieved
nobody
would
have
been
set
now
the
people
sneer
at
very
hills
and
sky
seem
to
laugh
at
me
till
i
blush
shamefully
for
my
folly
i

and
marry
your
on
boldwood
may
as
well
i
have
no
further
claim
upon
you
as
for
me
i
had
better
go
somewhere
alone
and
pray
i
loved
a
woman
once
i
am
now
ashamed
when
i
am
dead
say
miserable
man
that
he
was
i
had
got
jilted
secretly
and
the
dishonour
not
known
and
my
position
kept
but
no
matter
it
is
gone
and
the
woman
not
gained
shame
upon
his
unreasonable
anger
terrified
her
and
she
glided
from
him
without
obviously
moving
as
she
said

to
me
so
the
time
you
very
well

new
freak

my
misery
dazzled
by
brass
and
is
folly
indeed
she
fired
up
at
once
are
taking
too
much
upon
yourself
she
said
vehemently
is
upon
it
is
unmanly
to
attack
a
woman
so
i
have
nobody
in
the
world
to
fight
my
battles
for
me
but
no
mercy
is
shown
yet
if
a
thousand
of
you
sneer
and
say
things
against
me
i
be
put
down
chatter
with
him
doubtless
about
me
say
to
him

to
him

him
to
be
not

man
for
you
he
has
kissed
you
as
his
do
you
has
kissed
you
deny
it
the
most
tragic
woman
is
cowed
by
a
tragic
man
and
although
boldwood
was
in
vehemence
and
glow
nearly
her
own
self
rendered
into
another
sex
cheek
quivered
she
gasped
me
me
i
am
nothing
to
you
let
me
go
on
that
he
has
kissed
shall
he
has
came
hoarsely
from
the
farmer
has
she
said
slowly
and
in
spite
of
her
fear
defiantly
am
not
ashamed
to
speak
the
curse
him
and
curse
him
said
boldwood
breaking
into
a
whispered
fury
i
would
have
given
worlds
to
touch
your
hand
you
have
let
a
rake
come
in
without
right
or
ceremony
you
you
ah
a
time
of
his
life
shall
come
when
he
will
have
to
repent
and
think
wretchedly
of
the
pain
he
has
caused
another
man
and
then
may
he
ache
and
wish
and
curse
and
i
do
now
oh
pray
down
evil
upon
him
she
implored
in
a
miserable
cry
but
oh
be
kind
to
him
sir
for
i
love
him
true
ideas
had
reached
that
point
of
fusion
at
which
outline
and
consistency
entirely
disappear
the
impending
night
appeared
to
concentrate
in
his
eye
he
did
not
hear
her
at
all
now
punish
my
soul
that
will
i
meet
him
soldier
or
no
and
horsewhip
the
untimely
stripling
for
this
reckless
theft
of
my
one
delight
if
he
were
a
hundred
men
horsewhip
he
dropped
his
voice
suddenly
and
unnaturally
sweet
lost
coquette
pardon
me
been
blaming
you
threatening
you
behaving
like
a
churl
to
you
when
the
greatest
sinner
he
stole
your
dear
heart
away
with
his
unfathomable
lies
it
is
a
fortunate
thing
for
him
that
gone
back
to
his
away
up
the
country
and
not
here
i
hope
he
may
not
return
here
just
yet
i
pray
god
he
may
not
come
into
my
sight
for
i
may
be
tempted
beyond
myself
oh
bathsheba
keep
him
keep
him
away
from
me
for
a
moment
boldwood
stood
so
inertly
after
this
that
his
soul
seemed
to
have
been
entirely
exhaled
with
the
breath
of
his
passionate
words
he
turned
his
face
away
and
withdrew
and
his
form
was
soon
covered
over
by
the
twilight
as
his
footsteps
mixed
in
with
the
low
hiss
of
the
leafy
trees
bathsheba
who
had
been
standing
motionless
as
a
model
all
this
latter
time
flung
her
hands
to
her
face
and
wildly
attempted
to
ponder
on
the
exhibition
which
had
just
passed
away
such
astounding
wells
of
fevered
feeling
in
a
still
man
like
boldwood
were
incomprehensible
dreadful
instead
of
being
a
man
trained
to
repression
he
she
had
seen
him
the
force
of
the
threats
lay
in
their
relation
to
a
circumstance
known
at
present
only
to
herself
her
lover
was
coming
back
to
weatherbury
in
the
course
of
the
very
next
day
or
two
troy
had
not
returned
to
his
distant
barracks
as
boldwood
and
others
supposed
but
had
merely
gone
to
visit
some
acquaintance
in
bath
and
had
yet
a
week
or
more
remaining
to
his
furlough
she
felt
wretchedly
certain
that
if
he
revisited
her
just
at
this
nick
of
time
and
came
into
contact
with
boldwood
a
fierce
quarrel
would
be
the
consequence
she
panted
with
solicitude
when
she
thought
of
possible
injury
to
troy
the
least
spark
would
kindle
the
swift
feelings
of
rage
and
jealousy
he
would
lose
his
as
he
had
this
evening
blitheness
might
become
aggressive
it
might
take
the
direction
of
derision
and
anger
might
then
take
the
direction
of
revenge
with
almost
a
morbid
dread
of
being
thought
a
gushing
girl
this
guileless
woman
too
well
concealed
from
the
world
under
a
manner
of
carelessness
the
warm
depths
of
her
strong
emotions
but
now
there
was
no
reserve
in
her
distraction
instead
of
advancing
further
she
walked
up
and
down
beating
the
air
with
her
fingers
pressing
on
her
brow
and
sobbing
brokenly
to
herself
then
she
sat
down
on
a
heap
of
stones
by
the
wayside
to
think
there
she
remained
long
above
the
dark
margin
of
the
earth
appeared
foreshores
and
promontories
of
coppery
cloud
bounding
a
green
and
pellucid
expanse
in
the
western
sky
amaranthine
glosses
came
over
them
then
and
the
unresting
world
wheeled
her
round
to
a
contrasting
prospect
eastward
in
the
shape
of
indecisive
and
palpitating
stars
she
gazed
upon
their
silent
throes
amid
the
shades
of
space
but
realised
none
at
all
her
troubled
spirit
was
far
away
with
troy
chapter
xxxii
tramping
the
village
of
weatherbury
was
quiet
as
the
graveyard
in
its
midst
and
the
living
were
lying
as
still
as
the
dead
the
church
clock
struck
eleven
the
air
was
so
empty
of
other
sounds
that
the
whirr
of
the
immediately
before
the
strokes
was
distinct
and
so
was
also
the
click
of
the
same
at
their
close
the
notes
flew
forth
with
the
usual
blind
obtuseness
of
inanimate
and
rebounding
among
walls
undulating
against
the
scattered
clouds
spreading
through
their
interstices
into
unexplored
miles
of
space
crannied
and
mouldy
halls
were
occupied
only
by
maryann
liddy
being
as
was
stated
with
her
sister
whom
bathsheba
had
set
out
to
visit
a
few
minutes
after
eleven
had
struck
maryann
turned
in
her
bed
with
a
sense
of
being
disturbed
she
was
totally
unconscious
of
the
nature
of
the
interruption
to
her
sleep
it
led
to
a
dream
and
the
dream
to
an
awakening
with
an
uneasy
sensation
that
something
had
happened
she
left
her
bed
and
looked
out
of
the
window
the
paddock
abutted
on
this
end
of
the
building
and
in
the
paddock
she
could
just
discern
by
the
uncertain
gray
a
moving
figure
approaching
the
horse
that
was
feeding
there
the
figure
seized
the
horse
by
the
forelock
and
led
it
to
the
corner
of
the
field
here
she
could
see
some
object
which
circumstances
proved
to
be
a
vehicle
for
after
a
few
minutes
spent
apparently
in
harnessing
she
heard
the
trot
of
the
horse
down
the
road
mingled
with
the
sound
of
light
wheels
two
varieties
only
of
humanity
could
have
entered
the
paddock
with
the
ghostlike
glide
of
that
mysterious
figure
they
were
a
woman
and
a
gipsy
man
a
woman
was
out
of
the
question
in
such
an
occupation
at
this
hour
and
the
comer
could
be
no
less
than
a
thief
who
might
probably
have
known
the
weakness
of
the
household
on
this
particular
night
and
have
chosen
it
on
that
account
for
his
daring
attempt
moreover
to
raise
suspicion
to
conviction
itself
there
were
gipsies
in
weatherbury
bottom
maryann
who
had
been
afraid
to
shout
in
the
presence
having
seen
him
depart
had
no
fear
she
hastily
slipped
on
her
clothes
stumped
down
the
disjointed
staircase
with
its
hundred
creaks
ran
to
the
nearest
house
and
raised
an
alarm
coggan
called
gabriel
who
now
again
lodged
in
his
house
as
at
first
and
together
they
went
to
the
paddock
beyond
all
doubt
the
horse
was
gone
said
gabriel
they
listened
distinct
upon
the
stagnant
air
came
the
sounds
of
a
trotting
horse
passing
up
longpuddle
beyond
the
encampment
in
weatherbury
bottom
our
swear
to
her
step
said
me
storm
and
call
us
stupids
when
she
comes
back
moaned
maryann
i
wish
it
had
happened
when
she
was
at
home
and
none
of
us
had
been
answerable
must
ride
after
said
gabriel
decisively
be
responsible
to
miss
everdene
for
what
we
do
yes
i
see
how
said
coggan
our
horses
are
too
heavy
for
that
trick
except
little
poppet
and
she
between
two
of
us
we
only
had
that
pair
over
the
hedge
we
might
do
pair
tidy
and
wait
here
till
i
come
hither
again
said
gabriel
he
ran
down
the
hill
towards
farmer
boldwood
is
not
at
home
said
maryann
the
better
said
coggan
know
what
gone
less
than
five
minutes
brought
up
oak
again
running
at
the
same
pace
with
two
halters
dangling
from
his
hand
did
you
find
said
coggan
turning
round
and
leaping
upon
the
hedge
without
waiting
for
an
answer
the
eaves
i
knew
where
they
were
kept
said
gabriel
following
him
you
can
ride
no
time
to
look
for
a
hero
said
you
go
to
bed
gabriel
shouted
to
her
from
the
top
of
the
hedge
springing
down
into
pastures
each
pocketed
his
halter
to
hide
it
from
the
horses
who
seeing
the
men
docilely
allowed
themselves
to
be
seized
by
the
mane
when
the
halters
were
dexterously
slipped
on
having
neither
bit
nor
bridle
oak
and
coggan
extemporized
the
former
by
passing
the
rope
in
each
case
through
the
mouth
and
looping
it
on
the
other
side
oak
vaulted
astride
and
coggan
clambered
up
by
aid
of
the
bank
when
they
ascended
to
the
gate
and
galloped
off
in
the
direction
taken
by
horse
and
the
robber
whose
vehicle
the
horse
had
been
harnessed
to
was
a
matter
of
some
uncertainty
weatherbury
bottom
was
reached
in
three
or
four
minutes
they
scanned
the
shady
green
patch
by
the
roadside
the
gipsies
were
gone
villains
said
gabriel
way
have
they
gone
i
wonder
on
as
sure
as
god
made
little
apples
said
well
we
are
better
mounted
and
must
overtake
said
oak
on
at
full
speed
no
sound
of
the
rider
in
their
van
could
now
be
discovered
the
grew
softer
and
more
clayey
as
weatherbury
was
left
behind
and
the
late
rain
had
wetted
its
surface
to
a
somewhat
plastic
but
not
muddy
state
they
came
to
coggan
suddenly
pulled
up
moll
and
slipped
off
the
matter
said
gabriel
must
try
to
track
since
we
hear
said
jan
fumbling
in
his
pockets
he
struck
a
light
and
held
the
match
to
the
ground
the
rain
had
been
heavier
here
and
all
foot
and
horse
tracks
made
previous
to
the
storm
had
been
abraded
and
blurred
by
the
drops
and
they
were
now
so
many
little
scoops
of
water
which
reflected
the
flame
of
the
match
like
eyes
one
set
of
tracks
was
fresh
and
had
no
water
in
them
one
pair
of
ruts
was
also
empty
and
not
small
canals
like
the
others
the
footprints
forming
this
recent
impression
were
full
of
information
as
to
pace
they
were
in
equidistant
pairs
three
or
four
feet
apart
the
right
and
left
foot
of
each
pair
being
exactly
opposite
one
another
on
jan
exclaimed
like
that
mean
a
stiff
gallop
no
wonder
we
hear
him
and
the
horse
is
at
the
ruts
ay
our
mare
sure
enough
do
you
know
jimmy
harris
only
shoed
her
last
week
and
swear
to
his
make
among
ten
rest
of
the
gipsies
must
gone
on
earlier
or
some
other
way
said
oak
saw
there
were
no
other
tracks
they
rode
along
silently
for
a
long
weary
time
coggan
carried
an
old
pinchbeck
repeater
which
he
had
inherited
from
some
genius
in
his
family
and
it
now
struck
one
he
lighted
another
match
and
examined
the
ground
again
a
canter
now
he
said
throwing
away
the
light
twisty
rickety
pace
for
a
gig
the
fact
is
they
her
at
starting
we
shall
catch
again
they
hastened
on
and
entered
blackmore
vale
watch
struck
one
when
they
looked
again
the
were
so
spaced
as
to
form
a
sort
of
zigzag
if
united
like
the
lamps
along
a
street
a
trot
i
know
said
gabriel
a
trot
now
said
coggan
cheerfully
shall
overtake
him
in
they
pushed
rapidly
on
for
yet
two
or
three
miles
a
moment
said
see
how
she
was
driven
up
this
hill
help
a
light
was
promptly
struck
upon
his
gaiters
as
before
and
the
examination
made
said
coggan
walked
up
well
she
might
we
shall
get
them
in
two
miles
for
a
they
rode
three
and
listened
no
sound
was
to
be
heard
save
a
millpond
trickling
hoarsely
through
a
hatch
and
suggesting
gloomy
possibilities
of
drowning
by
jumping
in
gabriel
dismounted
when
they
came
to
a
turning
the
tracks
were
absolutely
the
only
guide
as
to
the
direction
that
they
now
had
and
great
caution
was
necessary
to
avoid
confusing
them
with
some
others
which
had
made
their
appearance
lately
does
this
mean
i
guess
said
gabriel
looking
up
at
coggan
as
he
moved
the
match
over
the
ground
about
the
turning
coggan
who
no
less
than
the
panting
horses
had
latterly
shown
signs
of
weariness
again
scrutinized
the
mystic
characters
this
time
only
three
were
of
the
regular
horseshoe
shape
every
fourth
was
a
dot
he
screwed
up
his
face
and
emitted
a
long
said
oak
dainty
is
lamed
the
said
coggan
slowly
staring
still
at
the
footprints
push
on
said
gabriel
remounting
his
humid
steed
although
the
road
along
its
greater
part
had
been
as
good
as
any
in
the
country
it
was
nominally
only
a
byway
the
last
turning
had
brought
them
into
the
high
road
leading
to
bath
coggan
recollected
himself
shall
have
him
now
he
exclaimed
turnpike
the
keeper
of
that
gate
is
the
sleepiest
man
between
here
and
randall
his
en
for
years
when
he
was
at
casterbridge
gate
between
the
lameness
and
the
gate
a
done
they
now
advanced
with
extreme
caution
nothing
was
said
until
against
a
shady
background
of
foliage
five
white
bars
were
visible
crossing
their
route
a
little
way
ahead
are
almost
close
said
gabriel
on
upon
the
grass
said
coggan
the
white
bars
were
blotted
out
in
the
midst
by
a
dark
shape
in
front
of
them
the
silence
of
this
lonely
time
was
pierced
by
an
exclamation
from
that
quarter
gate
it
appeared
that
there
had
been
a
previous
call
which
they
had
not
noticed
for
on
their
close
approach
the
door
of
the
opened
and
the
keeper
came
out
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
the
rays
illumined
the
whole
group
the
gate
close
shouted
gabriel
has
stolen
the
horse
said
the
gabriel
looked
at
the
driver
of
the
gig
and
saw
a
his
mistress
on
hearing
his
voice
she
had
turned
her
face
away
from
the
light
coggan
had
however
caught
sight
of
her
in
the
meanwhile
take
my
oath
he
said
amazed
bathsheba
it
certainly
was
and
she
had
by
this
time
done
the
trick
she
could
do
so
well
in
crises
not
of
love
namely
mask
a
surprise
by
coolness
of
manner
gabriel
she
inquired
quietly
are
you
going
began
gabriel
am
driving
to
bath
she
said
taking
for
her
own
use
the
assurance
that
gabriel
lacked
important
matter
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
give
up
my
visit
to
liddy
and
go
off
at
once
what
then
were
you
following
me
thought
the
horse
was
a
thing
how
very
foolish
of
you
not
to
know
that
i
had
taken
the
trap
and
horse
i
could
neither
wake
maryann
nor
get
into
the
house
though
i
hammered
for
ten
minutes
against
her
fortunately
i
could
get
the
key
of
the
so
i
troubled
no
one
further
you
think
it
might
be
me
should
we
miss
not
why
those
are
never
farmer
horses
goodness
mercy
what
have
you
been
trouble
upon
me
in
this
way
what
a
lady
move
an
inch
from
her
door
without
being
dogged
like
a
thief
how
was
we
to
know
if
you
left
no
account
of
your
doings
expostulated
coggan
ladies
drive
at
these
hours
miss
as
a
jineral
rule
of
did
leave
an
you
would
have
seen
it
in
the
morning
i
wrote
in
chalk
on
the
doors
that
i
had
come
back
for
the
horse
and
gig
and
driven
off
that
i
could
arouse
nobody
and
should
return
consider
that
we
see
that
till
it
got
she
said
and
though
vexed
at
first
she
had
too
much
sense
to
blame
them
long
or
seriously
for
a
devotion
to
her
that
was
as
valuable
as
it
was
rare
she
added
with
a
very
pretty
grace
i
really
thank
you
heartily
for
taking
all
this
trouble
but
i
wish
you
had
borrowed
horses
but
is
lame
miss
said
coggan
ye
go
on
was
only
a
stone
in
her
shoe
i
got
down
and
pulled
it
out
a
hundred
yards
back
i
can
manage
very
well
thank
you
i
shall
be
in
bath
by
daylight
will
you
now
return
please
she
turned
her
candle
shimmering
upon
her
quick
clear
eyes
as
she
did
through
the
gate
and
was
soon
wrapped
in
the
embowering
shades
of
mysterious
summer
boughs
coggan
and
gabriel
put
about
their
horses
and
fanned
by
the
velvety
air
of
this
july
night
retraced
the
road
by
which
they
had
come
strange
vagary
this
of
hers
it
oak
said
coggan
curiously
said
gabriel
shortly
be
in
bath
by
no
daylight
suppose
we
keep
this
work
as
quiet
as
we
can
am
of
one
and
the
same
well
we
shall
be
home
by
three
or
so
and
can
creep
into
the
parish
like
perturbed
meditations
by
the
roadside
had
ultimately
evolved
a
conclusion
that
there
were
only
two
remedies
for
the
present
desperate
state
of
affairs
the
first
was
merely
to
keep
troy
away
from
weatherbury
till
indignation
had
cooled
the
second
to
listen
to
entreaties
and
denunciations
and
give
up
troy
altogether
alas
could
she
give
up
this
new
him
to
renounce
her
by
saying
she
did
not
like
no
more
speak
to
him
and
beg
him
for
her
good
to
end
his
furlough
in
bath
and
see
her
and
weatherbury
no
more
it
was
a
picture
full
of
misery
but
for
a
while
she
contemplated
it
firmly
allowing
herself
nevertheless
as
girls
will
to
dwell
upon
the
happy
life
she
would
have
enjoyed
had
troy
been
boldwood
and
the
path
of
love
the
path
of
upon
herself
gratuitous
tortures
by
imagining
him
the
lover
of
another
woman
after
forgetting
her
for
she
had
penetrated
nature
so
far
as
to
estimate
his
tendencies
pretty
accurately
but
unfortunately
loved
him
no
less
in
thinking
that
he
might
soon
cease
to
love
considerably
more
she
jumped
to
her
feet
she
would
see
him
at
once
yes
she
would
implore
him
by
word
of
mouth
to
assist
her
in
this
dilemma
a
letter
to
keep
him
away
could
not
reach
him
in
time
even
if
he
should
be
disposed
to
listen
to
it
was
bathsheba
altogether
blind
to
the
obvious
fact
that
the
support
of
a
arms
is
not
of
a
kind
best
calculated
to
assist
a
resolve
to
renounce
him
or
was
she
sophistically
sensible
with
a
thrill
of
pleasure
that
by
adopting
this
course
for
getting
rid
of
him
she
was
ensuring
a
meeting
with
him
at
any
rate
once
more
it
was
now
dark
and
the
hour
must
have
been
nearly
ten
the
only
way
to
accomplish
her
purpose
was
to
give
up
her
idea
of
visiting
liddy
at
yalbury
return
to
weatherbury
farm
put
the
horse
into
the
gig
and
drive
at
once
to
bath
the
scheme
seemed
at
first
impossible
the
journey
was
a
fearfully
heavy
one
even
for
a
strong
horse
at
her
own
estimate
and
she
much
underrated
the
distance
it
was
most
venturesome
for
a
woman
at
night
and
alone
but
could
she
go
on
to
and
leave
things
to
take
their
course
no
no
anything
but
that
bathsheba
was
full
of
a
stimulating
turbulence
beside
which
caution
vainly
prayed
for
a
hearing
she
turned
back
towards
the
village
her
walk
was
slow
for
she
wished
not
to
enter
weatherbury
till
the
cottagers
were
in
bed
and
particularly
till
boldwood
was
secure
her
plan
was
now
to
drive
to
bath
during
the
night
see
sergeant
troy
in
the
morning
before
he
set
out
to
come
to
her
bid
him
farewell
and
dismiss
him
then
to
rest
the
horse
thoroughly
herself
to
weep
the
while
she
thought
starting
early
the
next
morning
on
her
return
journey
by
this
arrangement
she
could
trot
dainty
gently
all
the
day
reach
liddy
at
yalbury
in
the
evening
and
come
home
to
weatherbury
with
her
whenever
they
nobody
would
know
she
had
been
to
bath
at
all
such
was
scheme
but
in
her
topographical
ignorance
as
a
late
comer
to
the
place
she
misreckoned
the
distance
of
her
journey
as
not
much
more
than
half
what
it
really
was
this
idea
she
proceeded
to
carry
out
with
what
initial
success
we
have
already
seen
chapter
xxxiii
in
the
harbinger
a
week
passed
and
there
were
no
tidings
of
bathsheba
nor
was
there
any
explanation
of
her
rig
then
a
note
came
for
maryann
stating
that
the
business
which
had
called
her
mistress
to
bath
still
detained
her
there
but
that
she
hoped
to
return
in
the
course
of
another
week
another
week
passed
the
began
and
all
the
men
were
under
a
monochromatic
lammas
sky
amid
the
trembling
air
and
short
shadows
of
noon
indoors
nothing
was
to
be
heard
save
the
droning
of
flies
the
whetting
of
scythes
and
the
hiss
of
tressy
rubbing
together
as
their
perpendicular
stalks
of
fell
heavily
to
each
swath
every
drop
of
moisture
not
in
the
bottles
and
flagons
in
the
form
of
cider
was
raining
as
perspiration
from
their
foreheads
and
cheeks
drought
was
everywhere
else
they
were
about
to
withdraw
for
a
while
into
the
charitable
shade
of
a
tree
in
the
fence
when
coggan
saw
a
figure
in
a
blue
coat
and
brass
buttons
running
to
them
across
the
field
wonder
who
that
is
he
said
hope
nothing
is
wrong
about
mistress
said
maryann
who
with
some
other
women
was
tying
the
bundles
oats
being
always
sheafed
on
this
farm
an
unlucky
token
came
to
me
indoors
this
morning
i
went
to
unlock
the
door
and
dropped
the
key
and
it
fell
upon
the
stone
floor
and
broke
into
two
pieces
breaking
a
key
is
a
dreadful
bodement
i
wish
was
cain
ball
said
gabriel
pausing
from
whetting
his
reaphook
oak
was
not
bound
by
his
agreement
to
assist
in
the
but
the
harvest
month
is
an
anxious
time
for
a
farmer
and
the
corn
was
so
he
lent
a
hand
dressed
up
in
his
best
clothes
said
matthew
moon
hev
been
away
from
home
for
a
few
days
since
had
that
felon
upon
his
finger
for
said
since
i
work
have
a
good
time
for
excellent
time
said
joseph
poorgrass
straightening
his
back
for
he
like
some
of
the
others
had
a
way
of
resting
a
while
from
his
labour
on
such
hot
days
for
reasons
preternaturally
small
of
which
cain
advent
on
a
in
his
was
one
of
the
first
magnitude
a
bad
leg
allowed
me
to
read
the
and
mark
clark
learnt
in
a
and
my
father
put
his
arm
out
of
joint
to
have
time
to
go
courting
said
jan
coggan
in
an
eclipsing
tone
wiping
his
face
with
his
and
thrusting
back
his
hat
upon
the
nape
of
his
neck
by
this
time
cainy
was
nearing
the
group
of
harvesters
and
was
perceived
to
be
carrying
a
large
slice
of
bread
and
ham
in
one
hand
from
which
he
took
mouthfuls
as
he
ran
the
other
being
wrapped
in
a
bandage
when
he
came
close
his
mouth
assumed
the
bell
shape
and
he
began
to
cough
violently
cainy
said
gabriel
sternly
many
more
times
must
i
tell
you
to
keep
from
running
so
fast
when
you
be
eating
choke
yourself
some
day
what
do
cain
replied
cain
crumb
of
my
victuals
went
the
wrong
what
mister
oak
and
been
visiting
to
bath
because
i
had
a
felon
on
my
thumb
yes
and
directly
cain
mentioned
bath
they
all
threw
down
their
hooks
and
forks
and
drew
round
him
unfortunately
the
erratic
crumb
did
not
improve
his
narrative
powers
and
a
supplementary
hindrance
was
that
of
a
sneeze
jerking
from
his
pocket
his
rather
large
watch
which
dangled
in
front
of
the
young
man
he
continued
directing
his
thoughts
to
bath
and
letting
his
eyes
follow
seed
the
world
at
seed
our
the
boy
said
gabriel
is
always
going
the
wrong
way
down
your
throat
so
that
you
tell
necessary
to
be
there
please
mister
oak
a
gnat
have
just
fleed
into
my
stomach
and
brought
the
cough
on
again
just
it
your
mouth
is
always
open
you
young
rascal
terrible
bad
to
have
a
gnat
fly
down
yer
throat
pore
boy
said
matthew
moon
at
bath
you
prompted
gabriel
saw
our
mistress
continued
the
junior
shepherd
a
sojer
walking
along
and
bymeby
they
got
closer
and
closer
and
then
they
went
like
courting
like
courting
losing
the
thread
of
his
narrative
at
this
point
simultaneously
with
his
loss
of
breath
their
informant
looked
up
and
down
the
field
apparently
for
some
clue
to
it
i
see
our
and
a
the
boy
said
gabriel
only
my
manner
mister
oak
if
excuse
it
said
cain
ball
looking
reproachfully
at
oak
with
eyes
drenched
in
their
own
dew
some
cider
for
cure
his
throat
said
jan
coggan
lifting
a
flagon
of
cider
pulling
out
the
cork
and
applying
the
hole
to
mouth
joseph
poorgrass
in
the
meantime
beginning
to
think
apprehensively
of
the
serious
consequences
that
would
follow
cainy
strangulation
in
his
cough
and
the
history
of
his
bath
adventures
dying
with
him
my
poor
self
i
always
say
afore
i
do
anything
said
joseph
in
an
unboastful
voice
so
should
you
cain
ball
a
great
safeguard
and
might
perhaps
save
you
from
being
choked
to
death
some
coggan
poured
the
liquor
with
unstinted
liberality
at
the
suffering
circular
mouth
half
of
it
running
down
the
side
of
the
flagon
and
half
of
what
reached
his
mouth
running
down
outside
his
throat
and
half
of
what
ran
in
going
the
wrong
way
and
being
coughed
and
sneezed
around
the
persons
of
the
gathered
reapers
in
the
form
of
a
cider
fog
which
for
a
moment
hung
in
the
sunny
air
like
a
small
exhalation
a
great
clumsy
sneeze
why
ye
have
better
manners
you
young
dog
said
coggan
withdrawing
the
flagon
cider
went
up
my
nose
cried
cainy
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
now
gone
down
my
neck
and
into
my
poor
dumb
felon
and
over
my
shiny
buttons
and
all
my
best
cloze
poor
cough
is
terrible
unfortunate
said
matthew
moon
a
great
history
on
hand
too
bump
his
back
my
nater
mourned
cain
says
i
always
was
so
excitable
when
my
feelings
were
worked
up
to
a
point
true
said
joseph
poorgrass
balls
were
always
a
very
excitable
family
i
knowed
the
truly
nervous
and
modest
man
even
to
genteel
refinery
blush
blush
with
him
almost
as
much
as
with
but
that
a
fault
in
me
at
all
master
poorgrass
said
coggan
a
very
noble
quality
in
well
i
wish
to
noise
nothing
at
all
murmured
poorgrass
diffidently
we
be
born
to
true
yet
i
would
rather
my
trifle
were
hid
though
perhaps
a
high
nater
is
a
little
high
and
at
my
birth
all
things
were
possible
to
my
maker
and
he
may
have
begrudged
no
gifts
but
under
your
bushel
joseph
under
your
bushel
with
a
strange
desire
neighbours
this
desire
to
hide
and
no
praise
due
yet
there
is
a
sermon
on
the
mount
with
a
calendar
of
the
blessed
at
the
head
and
certain
meek
men
may
be
named
grandfather
was
a
very
clever
man
said
matthew
moon
out
of
his
own
head
which
is
called
by
his
name
to
this
early
ball
you
know
jan
a
quarrenden
grafted
on
a
tom
putt
and
a
upon
top
that
again
trew
used
to
bide
about
in
a
a
in
a
way
he
had
no
business
to
by
rights
but
were
a
clever
man
in
the
sense
of
the
then
said
gabriel
impatiently
did
you
see
cain
seed
our
go
into
a
sort
of
a
park
place
where
seats
and
shrubs
and
flowers
with
a
sojer
continued
cainy
firmly
and
with
a
dim
sense
that
his
words
were
very
effective
as
regarded
emotions
i
think
the
sojer
was
sergeant
troy
and
they
sat
there
together
for
more
than
talking
moving
things
and
she
once
was
crying
to
death
and
when
they
came
out
her
eyes
were
shining
and
she
was
as
white
as
a
lily
and
they
looked
into
one
faces
as
friendly
as
a
man
and
woman
can
features
seemed
to
get
thinner
what
did
you
see
besides
all
as
a
lily
you
are
sure
she
what
besides
glass
windows
to
the
shops
and
great
clouds
in
the
sky
full
of
rain
and
old
wooden
trees
in
the
country
what
will
ye
say
next
said
coggan
en
alone
interposed
joseph
poorgrass
meaning
is
that
the
sky
and
the
earth
in
the
kingdom
of
bath
is
not
altogether
different
from
ours
here
for
our
good
to
gain
knowledge
of
strange
cities
and
as
such
the
words
should
be
suffered
so
to
speak
the
people
of
bath
continued
cain
need
to
light
their
fires
except
as
a
luxury
for
the
water
springs
up
out
of
the
earth
ready
boiled
for
true
as
the
light
testified
matthew
moon
heard
other
navigators
say
the
same
drink
nothing
else
there
said
cain
seem
to
enjoy
it
to
see
how
they
swaller
it
it
seems
a
barbarian
practice
enough
to
us
but
i
daresay
the
natives
think
nothing
it
said
matthew
victuals
spring
up
as
well
as
drink
asked
coggan
twirling
his
eye
own
to
a
blot
there
in
true
blot
god
provide
with
victuals
as
well
as
drink
and
a
drawback
i
get
over
at
a
curious
place
to
say
the
least
observed
moon
it
must
be
a
curious
people
that
live
everdene
and
the
soldier
were
walking
about
together
you
say
said
gabriel
returning
to
the
group
and
she
wore
a
beautiful
silk
gown
trimmed
with
black
lace
that
would
have
stood
alone
legs
inside
if
required
a
very
winsome
sight
and
her
hair
was
brushed
splendid
and
when
the
sun
shone
upon
the
bright
gown
and
his
red
how
handsome
they
looked
you
could
see
all
the
length
of
the
what
then
murmured
gabriel
then
i
went
into
to
hae
my
boots
hobbed
and
then
i
went
to
shop
and
asked
for
a
penneth
of
the
cheapest
and
nicest
stales
that
were
all
but
but
not
quite
and
whilst
i
was
chawing
down
i
walked
on
and
seed
a
clock
with
a
face
as
big
as
a
baking
nothing
to
do
with
mistress
coming
to
that
if
leave
me
alone
mister
oak
remonstrated
cainy
you
excites
me
perhaps
bring
on
my
cough
and
then
i
be
able
to
tell
ye
him
tell
it
his
own
way
said
coggan
gabriel
settled
into
a
despairing
attitude
of
patience
and
cainy
went
on
there
were
great
large
houses
and
more
people
all
the
week
long
than
at
weatherbury
on
white
tuesdays
and
i
went
to
grand
churches
and
chapels
and
how
the
parson
would
pray
yes
he
would
kneel
down
and
put
up
his
hands
together
and
make
the
holy
gold
rings
on
his
fingers
gleam
and
twinkle
in
yer
eyes
that
earned
by
praying
so
excellent
well
yes
i
wish
i
lived
poor
parson
thirdly
get
no
money
to
buy
such
rings
said
matthew
moon
thoughtfully
as
good
a
man
as
ever
walked
i
believe
poor
thirdly
have
a
single
one
even
of
humblest
tin
or
copper
such
a
great
ornament
as
be
to
him
on
a
dull
afternoon
when
up
in
the
pulpit
lighted
by
the
wax
candles
but
impossible
poor
man
ah
to
think
how
unequal
things
made
of
different
stuff
than
to
wear
said
gabriel
grimly
enough
of
this
go
on
the
new
style
of
parsons
wear
moustaches
and
long
beards
continued
the
illustrious
traveller
look
like
moses
and
aaron
complete
and
make
we
fokes
in
the
congregation
feel
all
over
like
the
children
of
very
right
said
joseph
poorgrass
two
religions
going
on
in
the
nation
church
and
high
chapel
and
thinks
i
play
fair
so
i
went
to
high
church
in
the
morning
and
high
chapel
in
the
right
and
proper
boy
said
joseph
poorgrass
at
high
church
they
pray
singing
and
worship
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
and
at
high
chapel
they
pray
preaching
and
worship
drab
and
whitewash
only
and
see
no
more
of
miss
everdene
at
you
say
so
afore
then
exclaimed
oak
with
much
disappointment
said
matthew
moon
wish
her
cake
dough
if
so
be
over
intimate
with
that
not
over
intimate
with
him
said
gabriel
indignantly
would
know
better
said
coggan
has
too
much
sense
under
they
knots
of
black
hair
to
do
such
a
mad
see
not
a
coarse
ignorant
man
for
he
was
well
brought
up
said
matthew
dubiously
only
wildness
that
made
him
a
soldier
and
maids
rather
like
your
man
of
cain
ball
said
gabriel
restlessly
you
swear
in
the
most
awful
form
that
the
woman
you
saw
was
miss
everdene
ball
you
be
no
longer
a
babe
and
suckling
said
joseph
in
the
sepulchral
tone
the
circumstances
demanded
you
know
what
taking
an
oath
is
a
horrible
testament
mind
ye
which
you
say
and
seal
with
your
and
the
prophet
matthew
tells
us
that
on
whomsoever
it
shall
fall
it
will
grind
him
to
powder
now
before
all
the
here
assembled
can
you
swear
to
your
words
as
the
shepherd
asks
ye
no
mister
oak
said
cainy
looking
from
one
to
the
other
with
great
uneasiness
at
the
spiritual
magnitude
of
the
position
mind
saying
true
but
i
like
to
say
damn
true
if
what
you
cain
how
can
you
asked
joseph
sternly
be
asked
to
swear
in
a
holy
manner
and
you
swear
like
wicked
shimei
the
son
of
gera
who
cursed
as
he
came
young
man
fie
i
you
want
to
squander
a
pore
soul
joseph
what
said
cain
beginning
to
cry
i
mane
is
that
in
common
truth
miss
everdene
and
sergeant
troy
but
in
the
horrible
truth
that
ye
want
to
make
of
it
perhaps
somebody
else
no
getting
at
the
rights
of
it
said
gabriel
turning
to
his
work
ball
come
to
a
bit
of
bread
groaned
joseph
poorgrass
then
the
hooks
were
flourished
again
and
the
old
sounds
went
on
gabriel
without
making
any
pretence
of
being
lively
did
nothing
to
show
that
he
was
particularly
dull
however
coggan
knew
pretty
nearly
how
the
land
lay
and
when
they
were
in
a
nook
together
he
take
on
about
her
gabriel
what
difference
does
it
make
whose
sweetheart
she
is
since
she
be
yours
the
very
thing
i
say
to
myself
said
gabriel
chapter
xxxiv
home
trickster
that
same
evening
at
dusk
gabriel
was
leaning
over
taking
an
survey
before
retiring
to
rest
a
vehicle
of
some
kind
was
softly
creeping
along
the
grassy
margin
of
the
lane
from
it
spread
the
tones
of
two
women
talking
the
tones
were
natural
and
not
at
all
suppressed
oak
instantly
knew
the
voices
to
be
those
of
bathsheba
and
liddy
the
carriage
came
opposite
and
passed
by
it
was
miss
gig
and
liddy
and
her
mistress
were
the
only
occupants
of
the
seat
liddy
was
asking
questions
about
the
city
of
bath
and
her
companion
was
answering
them
listlessly
and
unconcernedly
both
bathsheba
and
the
horse
seemed
weary
the
exquisite
relief
of
finding
that
she
was
here
again
safe
and
sound
overpowered
all
reflection
and
oak
could
only
luxuriate
in
the
sense
of
it
all
grave
reports
were
forgotten
he
lingered
and
lingered
on
till
there
was
no
difference
between
the
eastern
and
western
expanses
of
sky
and
the
timid
hares
began
to
limp
courageously
round
the
dim
hillocks
gabriel
might
have
been
there
an
additional
when
a
dark
form
walked
slowly
by
gabriel
the
passer
said
it
was
boldwood
sir
said
gabriel
boldwood
likewise
vanished
up
the
road
and
oak
shortly
afterwards
turned
indoors
to
bed
farmer
boldwood
went
on
towards
miss
house
he
reached
the
front
and
approaching
the
entrance
saw
a
light
in
the
parlour
the
blind
was
not
drawn
down
and
inside
the
room
was
bathsheba
looking
over
some
papers
or
letters
her
back
was
towards
boldwood
he
went
to
the
door
knocked
and
waited
with
tense
muscles
and
an
aching
brow
boldwood
had
not
been
outside
his
garden
since
his
meeting
with
bathsheba
in
the
road
to
yalbury
silent
and
alone
he
had
remained
in
moody
meditation
on
ways
deeming
as
essentials
of
the
whole
sex
the
accidents
of
the
single
one
of
their
number
he
had
ever
closely
beheld
by
degrees
a
more
charitable
temper
had
pervaded
him
and
this
was
the
reason
of
his
sally
he
had
come
to
apologize
and
beg
forgiveness
of
bathsheba
with
something
like
a
sense
of
shame
at
his
violence
having
but
just
now
learnt
that
she
had
from
a
visit
to
liddy
as
he
supposed
the
bath
escapade
being
quite
unknown
to
him
he
inquired
for
miss
everdene
manner
was
odd
but
he
did
not
notice
it
she
went
in
leaving
him
standing
there
and
in
her
absence
the
blind
of
the
room
containing
bathsheba
was
pulled
down
boldwood
augured
ill
from
that
sign
liddy
came
out
mistress
can
not
see
you
sir
she
said
the
farmer
instantly
went
out
by
the
gate
he
was
was
the
issue
of
it
all
he
had
seen
her
who
was
to
him
simultaneously
a
delight
and
a
torture
sitting
in
the
room
he
had
shared
with
her
as
a
peculiarly
privileged
guest
only
a
little
earlier
in
the
summer
and
she
had
denied
him
an
entrance
there
now
boldwood
did
not
hurry
homeward
it
was
ten
at
least
when
walking
deliberately
through
the
lower
part
of
weatherbury
he
heard
the
spring
van
entering
the
village
the
van
ran
to
and
from
a
town
in
a
northern
direction
and
it
was
owned
and
driven
by
a
weatherbury
man
at
the
door
of
whose
house
it
now
pulled
up
the
lamp
fixed
to
the
head
of
the
hood
illuminated
a
scarlet
and
gilded
form
who
was
the
first
to
alight
said
boldwood
to
himself
to
see
her
troy
entered
the
house
which
had
been
the
place
of
his
lodging
on
his
last
visit
to
his
native
place
boldwood
was
moved
by
a
sudden
determination
he
hastened
home
in
ten
minutes
he
was
back
again
and
made
as
if
he
were
going
to
call
upon
troy
at
the
but
as
he
approached
some
one
opened
the
door
and
came
out
he
heard
this
person
say
to
the
inmates
and
the
voice
was
this
was
strange
coming
so
immediately
after
his
arrival
boldwood
however
hastened
up
to
him
troy
had
what
appeared
to
be
a
in
his
same
that
he
had
brought
with
him
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
going
to
leave
again
this
very
night
troy
turned
up
the
hill
and
quickened
his
pace
boldwood
stepped
forward
troy
sergeant
arrived
from
up
the
country
i
think
arrived
from
am
william
the
tone
in
which
this
word
was
uttered
was
all
that
had
been
wanted
to
bring
boldwood
to
the
point
wish
to
speak
a
word
with
you
he
said
about
her
who
lives
just
ahead
about
a
woman
you
have
wonder
at
your
impertinence
said
troy
moving
on
look
here
said
boldwood
standing
in
front
of
him
or
not
you
are
going
to
hold
a
conversation
with
troy
heard
the
dull
determination
in
voice
looked
at
his
stalwart
frame
then
at
the
thick
cudgel
he
carried
in
his
hand
he
remembered
it
was
past
ten
it
seemed
worth
while
to
be
civil
to
boldwood
well
listen
with
pleasure
said
troy
placing
his
bag
on
the
ground
speak
low
for
somebody
or
other
may
overhear
us
in
the
farmhouse
know
a
good
deal
concerning
your
fanny
attachment
to
you
i
may
say
too
that
i
believe
i
am
the
only
person
in
the
village
excepting
gabriel
oak
who
does
know
it
you
ought
to
marry
suppose
i
ought
indeed
i
wish
to
but
i
can
not
troy
was
about
to
utter
something
hastily
he
then
checked
himself
and
said
am
too
his
voice
was
changed
previously
it
had
had
a
tone
it
was
the
voice
of
a
trickster
now
present
mood
was
not
critical
enough
to
notice
tones
he
continued
may
as
well
speak
plainly
and
understand
i
wish
to
enter
into
the
questions
of
right
or
wrong
honour
and
shame
or
to
express
any
opinion
on
your
conduct
i
intend
a
business
transaction
with
see
said
troy
we
sit
down
an
old
tree
trunk
lay
under
the
hedge
immediately
opposite
and
they
sat
down
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
miss
everdene
said
boldwood
you
came
engaged
said
troy
good
as
i
had
not
turned
up
she
might
have
become
engaged
to
might
you
had
not
come
i
should
been
accepted
by
this
time
if
you
had
not
seen
her
you
might
have
been
married
to
fanny
well
too
much
difference
between
miss
station
and
your
own
for
this
flirtation
with
her
ever
to
benefit
you
by
ending
in
marriage
so
all
i
ask
is
molest
her
any
more
marry
fanny
make
it
worth
your
will
you
pay
you
well
now
settle
a
sum
of
money
upon
her
and
see
that
you
suffer
from
poverty
in
the
future
put
it
clearly
bathsheba
is
only
playing
with
you
you
are
too
poor
for
her
as
i
said
so
give
up
wasting
your
time
about
a
great
match
never
make
for
a
moderate
and
rightful
match
you
may
make
take
up
your
turn
about
leave
weatherbury
now
this
night
and
you
shall
take
fifty
pounds
with
you
fanny
shall
have
fifty
to
enable
her
to
prepare
for
the
wedding
when
you
have
told
me
where
she
is
living
and
she
shall
have
five
hundred
paid
down
on
her
in
making
this
statement
voice
revealed
only
too
clearly
a
consciousness
of
the
weakness
of
his
position
his
aims
and
his
method
his
manner
had
lapsed
quite
from
that
of
the
firm
and
dignified
boldwood
of
former
times
and
such
a
scheme
as
he
had
now
engaged
in
he
would
have
condemned
as
childishly
imbecile
only
a
few
months
ago
we
discern
a
grand
force
in
the
lover
which
he
lacks
whilst
a
free
man
but
there
is
a
breadth
of
vision
in
the
free
man
which
in
the
lover
we
vainly
seek
where
there
is
much
bias
there
must
be
some
narrowness
and
love
though
added
emotion
is
subtracted
capacity
boldwood
exemplified
this
to
an
abnormal
degree
he
knew
nothing
of
fanny
circumstances
or
whereabouts
he
knew
nothing
of
possibilities
yet
that
was
what
he
said
like
fanny
best
said
troy
if
as
you
say
miss
everdene
is
out
of
my
reach
why
i
have
all
to
gain
by
accepting
your
money
and
marrying
fan
but
only
a
you
agree
to
my
arrangement
said
boldwood
in
a
more
elastic
voice
troy
if
you
like
her
best
why
then
did
you
step
in
here
and
injure
my
happiness
love
fanny
best
now
said
troy
everdene
inflamed
me
and
displaced
fanny
for
a
time
it
is
over
should
it
be
over
so
soon
and
why
then
did
you
come
here
again
are
weighty
reasons
fifty
pounds
at
once
you
said
did
said
boldwood
here
they
he
handed
troy
a
small
packet
have
everything
seems
that
you
calculated
on
my
accepting
them
said
the
sergeant
taking
the
packet
thought
you
might
accept
them
said
boldwood
only
my
word
that
the
programme
shall
be
adhered
to
whilst
i
at
any
rate
have
fifty
had
thought
of
that
and
i
have
considered
that
if
i
appeal
to
your
honour
i
can
trust
to
shrewdness
call
to
lose
five
hundred
pounds
in
prospect
and
also
make
a
bitter
enemy
of
a
man
who
is
willing
to
be
an
extremely
useful
listen
said
troy
in
a
whisper
a
light
was
audible
upon
the
road
just
above
them
she
he
continued
must
go
on
and
meet
alone
at
this
time
night
said
boldwood
in
amazement
and
starting
up
must
you
meet
her
was
expecting
me
i
must
now
speak
to
her
and
wish
her
according
to
your
see
the
necessity
of
can
do
no
be
wandering
about
looking
for
me
if
i
you
shall
hear
all
i
say
to
her
it
will
help
you
in
your
when
i
am
tone
is
no
and
remember
this
if
she
does
not
know
what
has
become
of
me
she
will
think
more
about
me
than
if
i
tell
her
flatly
i
have
come
to
give
her
you
confine
your
words
to
that
one
point
i
hear
every
word
you
say
word
now
sit
still
there
and
hold
my
carpet
bag
for
me
and
mark
what
you
the
light
footstep
came
closer
halting
occasionally
as
if
the
walker
listened
for
a
sound
troy
whistled
a
double
note
in
a
soft
fluty
tone
to
that
is
it
murmured
boldwood
uneasily
promised
silence
said
troy
promise
troy
stepped
forward
dearest
is
that
you
the
tones
were
god
said
boldwood
said
troy
to
her
late
you
are
she
continued
tenderly
you
come
by
the
carrier
i
listened
and
heard
his
wheels
entering
the
village
but
it
was
some
time
ago
and
i
had
almost
given
you
up
was
sure
to
come
said
frank
knew
i
should
did
you
not
i
thought
you
would
she
said
playfully
frank
it
is
so
lucky
not
a
soul
in
my
house
but
me
packed
them
all
off
so
nobody
on
earth
will
know
of
your
visit
to
your
bower
liddy
wanted
to
go
to
her
to
tell
him
about
her
holiday
and
i
said
she
might
stay
with
them
till
be
gone
said
troy
dear
me
i
had
better
go
back
for
my
bag
because
my
slippers
and
brush
and
comb
are
in
it
you
run
home
whilst
i
fetch
it
and
promise
to
be
in
your
parlour
in
ten
she
turned
and
tripped
up
the
hill
again
during
the
progress
of
this
dialogue
there
was
a
nervous
twitching
of
tightly
closed
lips
and
his
face
became
bathed
in
a
clammy
dew
he
now
started
forward
towards
troy
troy
turned
to
him
and
took
up
the
bag
i
tell
her
i
have
come
to
give
her
up
and
can
not
marry
her
said
the
soldier
mockingly
no
wait
a
minute
i
want
to
say
more
to
to
you
said
boldwood
in
a
hoarse
whisper
said
troy
see
my
dilemma
perhaps
i
am
a
bad
victim
of
my
away
to
do
what
i
ought
to
leave
undone
i
however
marry
them
both
and
i
have
two
reasons
for
choosing
fanny
first
i
like
her
best
upon
the
whole
and
second
you
make
it
worth
my
at
the
same
instant
boldwood
sprang
upon
him
and
held
him
by
the
neck
troy
felt
grasp
slowly
tightening
the
move
was
absolutely
unexpected
moment
he
gasped
are
injuring
her
you
love
what
do
you
mean
said
the
farmer
me
breath
said
troy
boldwood
loosened
his
hand
saying
heaven
a
mind
to
kill
you
ruin
how
can
she
be
saved
now
unless
i
marry
her
boldwood
groaned
he
reluctantly
released
the
soldier
and
flung
him
back
against
the
hedge
you
torture
me
said
he
troy
rebounded
like
a
ball
and
was
about
to
make
a
dash
at
the
farmer
but
he
checked
himself
saying
is
not
worth
while
to
measure
my
strength
with
you
indeed
it
is
a
barbarous
way
of
settling
a
quarrel
i
shall
shortly
leave
the
army
because
of
the
same
conviction
now
after
that
revelation
of
how
the
land
lies
with
bathsheba
be
a
mistake
to
kill
me
would
it
not
be
a
mistake
to
kill
you
repeated
boldwood
mechanically
with
a
bowed
head
kill
glad
you
see
make
her
your
wife
and
act
upon
what
i
arranged
just
now
the
alternative
is
dreadful
but
take
bathsheba
i
give
her
up
she
must
love
you
indeed
to
sell
soul
and
body
to
you
so
utterly
as
she
has
done
wretched
are
bathsheba
about
fanny

a
woman
well
to
do
continued
boldwood
in
nervous
anxiety
troy
she
will
make
a
good
wife
and
indeed
she
is
worth
your
hastening
on
your
marriage
with
her
she
has
a
to
say
a
temper
and
i
shall
be
a
mere
slave
to
her
i
could
do
anything
with
poor
fanny

boldwood
imploringly
do
anything
for
you

advantageous
it
will
be
to
you
to
secure

once

to
secure
her
in
any
new
arm
moved
spasmodically
towards
person
again
he
repressed
the
instinct
and
his
form
drooped
as
with
pain
troy
went
shall
soon
purchase
my
discharge
and
i
wish
you
to
hasten
on
this
marriage
it
will
be
better
for
you
both
you
love
each
other
and
you
must
let
me
help
you
to
do
by
settling
the
five
hundred
on
bathsheba
instead
of
fanny
to
enable
you
to
marry
at
once
no
she
have
it
of
me
pay
it
down
to
you
on
the
troy
paused
in
secret
amazement
at
wild
infatuation
he
carelessly
said
am
i
to
have
anything
now
if
you
wish
to
but
i
have
not
much
additional
money
with
me
i
did
not
expect
this
but
all
i
have
is
boldwood
more
like
a
somnambulist
than
a
wakeful
man
pulled
out
the
large
canvas
bag
he
carried
by
way
of
a
purse
and
searched
it
have
pounds
more
with
me
he
said
notes
and
a
sovereign
but
before
i
leave
you
i
must
have
a
paper
me
the
money
and
go
straight
to
her
parlour
and
make
any
arrangement
you
please
to
secure
my
compliance
with
your
wishes
but
she
must
know
nothing
of
this
cash
nothing
said
boldwood
hastily
is
the
sum
and
if
come
to
my
house
write
out
the
agreement
for
the
remainder
and
the
terms
call
upon
why
come
with
me
and
go
with
me
to
the
she
must
be
consulted
at
any
rate
well
go
they
went
up
the
hill
to
house
when
they
stood
at
the
entrance
troy
said
here
a
opening
the
door
he
glided
inside
leaving
the
door
ajar
boldwood
waited
in
two
minutes
a
light
appeared
in
the
passage
boldwood
then
saw
that
the
chain
had
been
fastened
across
the
door
troy
appeared
inside
carrying
a
bedroom
candlestick
did
you
think
i
should
break
in
said
boldwood
contemptuously
no
it
is
merely
my
humour
to
secure
things
will
you
read
this
a
moment
hold
the
troy
handed
a
folded
newspaper
through
the
slit
between
door
and
doorpost
and
put
the
candle
close
the
paragraph
he
said
placing
his

on
a
line

said
troy
a
low
gurgle
of
derisive
laughter
followed
the
words
the

fell
from

good
pounds
not

but

good
finale
already
husband
now
boldwood
yours
is
the
ridiculous
fate
which
always
attends
interference
between
a
man
and
his
wife
and
another
word
bad
as
i
am
i
am
not
such
a
villain
as
to
make
the
marriage
or
misery
of
any
woman
a
matter
of
huckster
and

fanny
has
long
ago
left
me
i
know
where
she
is
i
have
searched
everywhere
another
word
yet
you
say
you
love
bathsheba
yet
on
the
merest
apparent
evidence
you
instantly
believe
in
her
dishonour
a
fig
for
such
love
now
that
taught
you
a
lesson
take
your
money
back
will
not
i
will
not
said
boldwood
in
a
hiss
i
have
it
said
troy
contemptuously
he
wrapped
the
packet
of
gold
in
the
notes
and
threw
the
whole
into
the
road
boldwood
shook
his
clenched
fist
at
him
juggler
of
satan
you
black
hound
but
punish
you
yet
mark
me
punish
you
yet
another
peal
of
laughter
troy
then
closed
the
door
and
locked
himself
in
throughout
the
whole
of
that
night
dark
form
might
have
been
seen
walking
about
the
hills
and
downs
of
weatherbury
like
an
unhappy
shade
in
the
mournful
fields
by
acheron
chapter
xxxv
at
an
upper
window
it
was
very
early
the
next
time
of
sun
and
dew
the
confused
beginnings
of
many
songs
spread
into
the
healthy
air
and
the
wan
blue
of
the
heaven
was
here
and
there
coated
with
thin
webs
of
incorporeal
cloud
which
were
of
no
effect
in
obscuring
day
all
the
lights
in
the
scene
were
yellow
as
to
colour
and
all
the
shadows
were
attenuated
as
to
form
the
creeping
plants
about
the
old
were
bowed
with
rows
of
heavy
water
drops
which
had
upon
objects
behind
them
the
effect
of
minute
lenses
of
high
magnifying
power
just
before
the
clock
struck
five
gabriel
oak
and
coggan
passed
the
village
cross
and
went
on
together
to
the
fields
they
were
yet
barely
in
view
of
their
house
when
oak
fancied
he
saw
the
opening
of
a
casement
in
one
of
the
upper
windows
the
two
men
were
at
this
moment
partially
screened
by
an
elder
bush
now
beginning
to
be
enriched
with
black
bunches
of
fruit
and
they
paused
before
emerging
from
its
shade
a
handsome
man
leaned
idly
from
the
lattice
he
looked
east
and
then
west
in
the
manner
of
one
who
makes
a
first
morning
survey
the
man
was
sergeant
troy
his
red
jacket
was
loosely
thrown
on
but
not
buttoned
and
he
had
altogether
the
relaxed
bearing
of
a
soldier
taking
his
ease
coggan
spoke
first
looking
quietly
at
the
window
has
married
him
he
said
gabriel
had
previously
beheld
the
sight
and
he
now
stood
with
his
back
turned
making
no
reply
fancied
we
should
know
something
continued
coggan
heard
wheels
pass
my
door
just
after
were
out
he
glanced
round
upon
gabriel
heavens
above
us
oak
how
white
your
face
is
you
look
like
a
corpse
i
said
oak
with
a
faint
smile
on
the
gate
wait
a
right
all
they
stood
by
the
gate
awhile
gabriel
listlessly
staring
at
the
ground
his
mind
sped
into
the
future
and
saw
there
enacted
in
years
of
leisure
the
scenes
of
repentance
that
would
ensue
from
this
work
of
haste
that
they
were
married
he
had
instantly
decided
why
had
it
been
so
mysteriously
managed
it
had
become
known
that
she
had
had
a
fearful
journey
to
bath
owing
to
her
miscalculating
the
distance
that
the
horse
had
broken
down
and
that
she
had
been
more
than
two
days
getting
there
it
was
not
way
to
do
things
furtively
with
all
her
faults
she
was
candour
itself
could
she
have
been
entrapped
the
union
was
not
only
an
unutterable
grief
to
him
it
amazed
him
notwithstanding
that
he
had
passed
the
preceding
week
in
a
suspicion
that
such
might
be
the
issue
of
meeting
her
away
from
home
her
quiet
return
with
liddy
had
to
some
extent
dispersed
the
dread
just
as
that
imperceptible
motion
which
appears
like
stillness
is
infinitely
divided
in
its
properties
from
stillness
itself
so
had
his
hope
undistinguishable
from
despair
differed
from
despair
indeed
in
a
few
minutes
they
moved
on
again
towards
the
house
the
sergeant
still
looked
from
the
window
comrades
he
shouted
in
a
cheery
voice
when
they
came
up
coggan
replied
to
the
greeting
ye
going
to
answer
the
man
he
then
said
to
gabriel
say
good
spend
a
hapenny
of
meaning
upon
it
and
yet
keep
the
man
gabriel
soon
decided
too
that
since
the
deed
was
done
to
put
the
best
face
upon
the
matter
would
be
the
greatest
kindness
to
her
he
loved
morning
sergeant
troy
he
returned
in
a
ghastly
voice
rambling
gloomy
house
this
said
troy
smiling
not
be
married
suggested
coggan
not
gabriel
shook
his
head
the
soldier
turned
a
little
towards
the
east
and
the
sun
kindled
his
scarlet
coat
to
an
orange
glow
it
is
a
nice
old
house
responded
gabriel
suppose
so
but
i
feel
like
new
wine
in
an
old
bottle
here
my
notion
is
that
should
be
put
throughout
and
these
old
wainscoted
walls
brightened
up
a
bit
or
the
oak
cleared
quite
away
and
the
walls
would
be
a
pity
i
no
a
philosopher
once
said
in
my
hearing
that
the
old
builders
who
worked
when
art
was
a
living
thing
had
no
respect
for
the
work
of
builders
who
went
before
them
but
pulled
down
and
altered
as
they
thought
fit
and
why
we
and
preservation
do
well
together
says
he
a
million
of
antiquarians
invent
a
my
mind
exactly
i
am
for
making
this
place
more
modern
that
we
may
be
cheerful
whilst
we
the
military
man
turned
and
surveyed
the
interior
of
the
room
to
assist
his
ideas
of
improvement
in
this
direction
gabriel
and
coggan
began
to
move
on
coggan
said
troy
as
if
inspired
by
a
recollection
you
know
if
insanity
has
ever
appeared
in
family
jan
reflected
for
a
moment
once
heard
that
an
uncle
of
his
was
queer
in
his
head
but
i
know
the
rights
he
said
is
of
no
importance
said
troy
lightly
i
shall
be
down
in
the
fields
with
you
some
time
this
week
but
i
have
a
few
matters
to
attend
to
first
so
to
you
we
shall
of
course
keep
on
just
as
friendly
terms
as
usual
not
a
proud
man
nobody
is
ever
able
to
say
that
of
sergeant
troy
however
what
is
must
be
and
to
drink
my
health
troy
threw
the
coin
dexterously
across
the
front
plot
and
over
the
fence
towards
gabriel
who
shunned
it
in
its
fall
his
face
turning
to
an
angry
red
coggan
twirled
his
eye
edged
forward
and
caught
the
money
in
its
ricochet
upon
the
road
keep
it
coggan
said
gabriel
with
disdain
and
almost
fiercely
for
me
do
without
gifts
from
him
show
it
too
much
said
coggan
musingly
if
married
to
her
mark
my
words
buy
his
discharge
and
be
our
master
here
therefore
well
to
say
outwardly
though
you
say
it
is
best
to
be
silent
but
i
go
further
than
that
i
flatter
and
if
my
place
here
is
only
to
be
kept
by
smoothing
him
down
my
place
must
be
a
horseman
whom
they
had
for
some
time
seen
in
the
distance
now
appeared
close
beside
them
boldwood
said
oak
wonder
what
troy
meant
by
his
coggan
and
oak
nodded
respectfully
to
the
farmer
just
checked
their
paces
to
discover
if
they
were
wanted
and
finding
they
were
not
stood
back
to
let
him
pass
on
the
only
signs
of
the
terrible
sorrow
boldwood
had
been
combating
through
the
night
and
was
combating
now
were
the
want
of
colour
in
his
face
the
enlarged
appearance
of
the
veins
in
his
forehead
and
temples
and
the
sharper
lines
about
his
mouth
the
horse
bore
him
away
and
the
very
step
of
the
animal
seemed
significant
of
dogged
despair
gabriel
for
a
minute
rose
above
his
own
grief
in
noticing
he
saw
the
square
figure
sitting
erect
upon
the
horse
the
head
turned
to
neither
side
the
elbows
steady
by
the
hips
the
brim
of
the
hat
level
and
undisturbed
in
its
onward
glide
until
the
keen
edges
of
shape
sank
by
degrees
over
the
hill
to
one
who
knew
the
man
and
his
story
there
was
something
more
striking
in
this
immobility
than
in
a
collapse
the
clash
of
discord
between
mood
and
matter
here
was
forced
painfully
home
to
the
heart
and
as
in
laughter
there
are
more
dreadful
phases
than
in
tears
so
was
there
in
the
steadiness
of
this
agonized
man
an
expression
deeper
than
a
cry
chapter

wealth
in
revel
one
night
at
the
end
of
august
when
experiences
as
a
married
woman
were
still
new
and
when
the
weather
was
yet
dry
and
sultry
a
man
stood
motionless
in
the
stockyard
of
weatherbury
upper
farm
looking
at
the
moon
and
sky
the
night
had
a
sinister
aspect
a
heated
breeze
from
the
south
slowly
fanned
the
summits
of
lofty
objects
and
in
the
sky
dashes
of
buoyant
cloud
were
sailing
in
a
course
at
right
angles
to
that
of
another
stratum
neither
of
them
in
the
direction
of
the
breeze
below
the
moon
as
seen
through
these
films
had
a
lurid
metallic
look
the
fields
were
sallow
with
the
impure
light
and
all
were
tinged
in
monochrome
as
if
beheld
through
stained
glass
the
same
evening
the
sheep
had
trailed
homeward
head
to
tail
the
behaviour
of
the
rooks
had
been
confused
and
the
horses
had
moved
with
timidity
and
caution
thunder
was
imminent
and
taking
some
secondary
appearances
into
consideration
it
was
likely
to
be
followed
by
one
of
the
lengthened
rains
which
mark
the
close
of
dry
weather
for
the
season
before
twelve
hours
had
passed
a
harvest
atmosphere
would
be
a
bygone
thing
oak
gazed
with
misgiving
at
eight
naked
and
unprotected
ricks
massive
and
heavy
with
the
rich
produce
of
the
farm
for
that
year
he
went
on
to
the
barn
this
was
the
night
which
had
been
selected
by
sergeant
now
in
the
room
of
his
giving
the
harvest
supper
and
dance
as
oak
approached
the
building
the
sound
of
violins
and
a
tambourine
and
the
regular
jigging
of
many
feet
grew
more
distinct
he
came
close
to
the
large
doors
one
of
which
stood
slightly
ajar
and
looked
in
the
central
space
together
with
the
recess
at
one
end
was
emptied
of
all
incumbrances
and
this
area
covering
about
of
the
whole
was
appropriated
for
the
gathering
the
remaining
end
which
was
piled
to
the
ceiling
with
oats
being
screened
off
with
tufts
and
garlands
of
green
foliage
decorated
the
walls
beams
and
extemporized
chandeliers
and
immediately
opposite
to
oak
a
rostrum
had
been
erected
bearing
a
table
and
chairs
here
sat
three
fiddlers
and
beside
them
stood
a
frantic
man
with
his
hair
on
end
perspiration
streaming
down
his
cheeks
and
a
tambourine
quivering
in
his
hand
the
dance
ended
and
on
the
black
oak
floor
in
the
midst
a
new
row
of
couples
formed
for
another
and
no
offence
i
hope
i
ask
what
dance
you
would
like
next
said
the
first
violin
it
makes
no
difference
said
the
clear
voice
of
bathsheba
who
stood
at
the
inner
end
of
the
building
observing
the
scene
from
behind
a
table
covered
with
cups
and
viands
troy
was
lolling
beside
her
said
the
fiddler
venture
to
name
that
the
right
and
proper
thing
is
being
a
gallant
soldier
married
into
the
my
sonnies
and
gentlemen
all
shall
be
joy
exclaimed
a
chorus
for
the
compliment
said
the
sergeant
gaily
taking
bathsheba
by
the
hand
and
leading
her
to
the
top
of
the
dance
though
i
have
purchased
my
discharge
from
her
most
gracious
regiment
of
cavalry
the
dragoon
guards
to
attend
to
the
new
duties
awaiting
me
here
i
shall
continue
a
soldier
in
spirit
and
feeling
as
long
as
i
so
the
dance
began
as
to
the
merits
of
joy
there
can
not
be
and
never
were
two
opinions
it
has
been
observed
in
the
musical
circles
of
weatherbury
and
its
vicinity
that
this
melody
at
the
end
of
of
an
hour
of
thunderous
footing
still
possesses
more
stimulative
properties
for
the
heel
and
toe
than
the
majority
of
other
dances
at
their
first
opening
has
too
an
additional
charm
in
being
so
admirably
adapted
to
the
tambourine
mean
instrument
in
the
hands
of
a
performer
who
understands
the
proper
convulsions
spasms
dances
and
fearful
frenzies
necessary
when
exhibiting
its
tones
in
their
highest
perfection
the
immortal
tune
ended
a
fine
dd
rolling
forth
from
the
with
the
sonorousness
of
a
cannonade
and
gabriel
delayed
his
entry
no
longer
he
avoided
bathsheba
and
got
as
near
as
possible
to
the
platform
where
sergeant
troy
was
now
seated
drinking
though
the
others
drank
without
exception
cider
and
ale
gabriel
could
not
easily
thrust
himself
within
speaking
distance
of
the
sergeant
and
he
sent
a
message
asking
him
to
come
down
for
a
moment
the
sergeant
said
he
could
not
attend
you
tell
him
then
said
gabriel
i
only
stepped
to
say
that
a
heavy
rain
is
sure
to
fall
soon
and
that
something
should
be
done
to
protect
the
ricks
troy
says
it
will
not
rain
returned
the
messenger
he
can
not
stop
to
talk
to
you
about
such
in
juxtaposition
with
troy
oak
had
a
melancholy
tendency
to
look
like
a
candle
beside
gas
and
ill
at
ease
he
went
out
again
thinking
he
would
go
home
for
under
the
circumstances
he
had
no
heart
for
the
scene
in
the
barn
at
the
door
he
paused
for
a
moment
troy
was
speaking
it
is
not
only
the
harvest
home
that
we
are
celebrating
but
this
is
also
a
wedding
feast
a
short
time
ago
i
had
the
happiness
to
lead
to
the
altar
this
lady
your
mistress
and
not
until
now
have
we
been
able
to
give
any
public
flourish
to
the
event
in
weatherbury
that
it
may
be
thoroughly
well
done
and
that
every
man
may
go
happy
to
bed
i
have
ordered
to
be
brought
here
some
bottles
of
brandy
and
kettles
of
hot
water
a
goblet
will
be
handed
round
to
each
bathsheba
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
with
upturned
pale
face
said
imploringly
give
it
to
frank
it
will
only
do
them
harm
they
have
had
enough
of
wish
for
no
more
thank
ye
said
one
or
two
said
the
sergeant
contemptuously
and
raised
his
voice
as
if
lighted
up
by
a
new
idea
he
said
send
the
home
time
they
were
in
bed
then
we
cockbirds
will
have
a
jolly
carouse
to
ourselves
if
any
of
the
men
show
the
white
feather
let
them
look
elsewhere
for
a
bathsheba
indignantly
left
the
barn
followed
by
all
the
women
and
children
the
musicians
not
looking
upon
themselves
as
slipped
quietly
away
to
their
spring
waggon
and
put
in
the
horse
thus
troy
and
the
men
on
the
farm
were
left
sole
occupants
of
the
place
oak
not
to
appear
unnecessarily
disagreeable
stayed
a
little
while
then
he
too
arose
and
quietly
took
his
departure
followed
by
a
friendly
oath
from
the
sergeant
for
not
staying
to
a
second
round
of
grog
gabriel
proceeded
towards
his
home
in
approaching
the
door
his
toe
kicked
something
which
felt
and
sounded
soft
leathery
and
distended
like
a
it
was
a
large
toad
humbly
travelling
across
the
path
oak
took
it
up
thinking
it
might
be
better
to
kill
the
creature
to
save
it
from
pain
but
finding
it
uninjured
he
placed
it
again
among
the
grass
he
knew
what
this
direct
message
from
the
great
mother
meant
and
soon
came
another
when
he
struck
a
light
indoors
there
appeared
upon
the
table
a
thin
glistening
streak
as
if
a
brush
of
varnish
had
been
lightly
dragged
across
it
eyes
followed
the
serpentine
sheen
to
the
other
side
where
it
led
up
to
a
huge
brown
which
had
come
indoors
for
reasons
of
its
own
it
was
second
way
of
hinting
to
him
that
he
was
to
prepare
for
foul
weather
oak
sat
down
meditating
for
nearly
an
hour
during
this
time
two
black
spiders
of
the
kind
common
in
thatched
houses
promenaded
the
ceiling
ultimately
dropping
to
the
floor
this
reminded
him
that
if
there
was
one
class
of
manifestation
on
this
matter
that
he
thoroughly
understood
it
was
the
instincts
of
sheep
he
left
the
room
ran
across
two
or
three
fields
towards
the
flock
got
upon
a
hedge
and
looked
over
among
them
they
were
crowded
close
together
on
the
other
side
around
some
furze
bushes
and
the
first
peculiarity
observable
was
that
on
the
sudden
appearance
of
head
over
the
fence
they
did
not
stir
or
run
away
they
had
now
a
terror
of
something
greater
than
their
terror
of
man
but
this
was
not
the
most
noteworthy
feature
they
were
all
grouped
in
such
a
way
that
their
tails
without
a
single
exception
were
towards
that
half
of
the
horizon
from
which
the
storm
threatened
there
was
an
inner
circle
closely
huddled
and
outside
these
they
radiated
wider
apart
the
pattern
formed
by
the
flock
as
a
whole
not
being
unlike
a
vandyked
lace
collar
to
which
the
clump
of
stood
in
the
position
of
a
neck
this
was
enough
to
him
in
his
original
opinion
he
knew
now
that
he
was
right
and
that
troy
was
wrong
every
voice
in
nature
was
unanimous
in
bespeaking
change
but
two
distinct
translations
attached
to
these
dumb
expressions
apparently
there
was
to
be
a
and
afterwards
a
cold
continuous
rain
the
creeping
things
seemed
to
know
all
about
the
later
rain
but
little
of
the
interpolated
whilst
the
sheep
knew
all
about
the
and
nothing
of
the
later
rain
this
complication
of
weathers
being
uncommon
was
all
the
more
to
be
feared
oak
returned
to
the
all
was
silent
here
and
the
conical
tips
of
the
ricks
jutted
darkly
into
the
sky
there
were
five
in
this
yard
and
three
stacks
of
barley
the
wheat
when
threshed
would
average
about
thirty
quarters
to
each
stack
the
barley
at
least
forty
their
value
to
bathsheba
and
indeed
to
anybody
oak
mentally
estimated
by
the
following
simple
calculation
quarters
quarters
total
seven
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
in
the
divinest
form
that
money
can
of
necessary
food
for
man
and
beast
should
the
risk
be
run
of
deteriorating
this
bulk
of
corn
to
less
than
half
its
value
because
of
the
instability
of
a
woman
if
i
can
prevent
it
said
gabriel
such
was
the
argument
that
oak
set
outwardly
before
him
but
man
even
to
himself
is
a
palimpsest
having
an
ostensible
writing
and
another
beneath
the
lines
it
is
possible
that
there
was
this
golden
legend
under
the
utilitarian
one
will
help
to
my
last
effort
the
woman
i
have
loved
so
he
went
back
to
the
barn
to
endeavour
to
obtain
assistance
for
covering
the
ricks
that
very
night
all
was
silent
within
and
he
would
have
passed
on
in
the
belief
that
the
party
had
broken
up
had
not
a
dim
light
yellow
as
saffron
by
contrast
with
the
greenish
whiteness
outside
streamed
through
a
in
the
folding
doors
gabriel
looked
in
an
unusual
picture
met
his
eye
the
candles
suspended
among
the
evergreens
had
burnt
down
to
their
sockets
and
in
some
cases
the
leaves
tied
about
them
were
scorched
many
of
the
lights
had
quite
gone
out
others
smoked
and
stank
grease
dropping
from
them
upon
the
floor
here
under
the
table
and
leaning
against
forms
and
chairs
in
every
conceivable
attitude
except
the
perpendicular
were
the
wretched
persons
of
all
the
the
hair
of
their
heads
at
such
low
levels
being
suggestive
of
mops
and
brooms
in
the
midst
of
these
shone
red
and
distinct
the
figure
of
sergeant
troy
leaning
back
in
a
chair
coggan
was
on
his
back
with
his
mouth
open
huzzing
forth
snores
as
were
several
others
the
united
breathings
of
the
horizonal
assemblage
forming
a
subdued
roar
like
london
from
a
distance
joseph
poorgrass
was
curled
round
in
the
fashion
of
a
apparently
in
attempts
to
present
the
least
possible
portion
of
his
surface
to
the
air
and
behind
him
was
dimly
visible
an
unimportant
remnant
of
william
smallbury
the
glasses
and
cups
still
stood
upon
the
table
a
being
overturned
from
which
a
small
rill
after
tracing
its
course
with
marvellous
precision
down
the
centre
of
the
long
table
fell
into
the
neck
of
the
unconscious
mark
clark
in
a
steady
monotonous
drip
like
the
dripping
of
a
stalactite
in
a
cave
gabriel
glanced
hopelessly
at
the
group
which
with
one
or
two
exceptions
composed
all
the
men
upon
the
farm
he
saw
at
once
that
if
the
ricks
were
to
be
saved
that
night
or
even
the
next
morning
he
must
save
them
with
his
own
hands
a
faint
resounded
from
under
waistcoat
it
was
watch
striking
the
hour
of
two
oak
went
to
the
recumbent
form
of
matthew
moon
who
usually
undertook
the
rough
thatching
of
the
and
shook
him
the
shaking
was
without
effect
gabriel
shouted
in
his
ear
your
and
and
spars
the
staddles
said
moon
mechanically
with
the
unconscious
promptness
of
a
medium
gabriel
let
go
his
head
and
it
dropped
upon
the
floor
like
a
bowl
he
then
went
to
susan
husband
the
key
of
the
granary
no
answer
the
question
was
repeated
with
the
same
result
to
be
shouted
to
at
night
was
evidently
less
of
a
novelty
to
susan
husband
than
to
matthew
moon
oak
flung
down
head
into
the
corner
again
and
turned
away
to
be
just
the
men
were
not
greatly
to
blame
for
this
painful
and
demoralizing
termination
to
the
entertainment
sergeant
troy
had
so
strenuously
insisted
glass
in
hand
that
drinking
should
be
the
bond
of
their
union
that
those
who
wished
to
refuse
hardly
liked
to
be
so
unmannerly
under
the
circumstances
having
from
their
youth
up
been
entirely
unaccustomed
to
any
liquor
stronger
than
cider
or
mild
ale
it
was
no
wonder
that
they
had
succumbed
one
and
all
with
extraordinary
uniformity
after
the
lapse
of
about
an
hour
gabriel
was
greatly
depressed
this
debauch
boded
ill
for
that
wilful
and
fascinating
mistress
whom
the
faithful
man
even
now
felt
within
him
as
the
embodiment
of
all
that
was
sweet
and
bright
and
hopeless
he
put
out
the
expiring
lights
that
the
barn
might
not
be
endangered
closed
the
door
upon
the
men
in
their
deep
and
oblivious
sleep
and
went
again
into
the
lone
night
a
hot
breeze
as
if
breathed
from
the
parted
lips
of
some
dragon
about
to
swallow
the
globe
fanned
him
from
the
south
while
directly
opposite
in
the
north
rose
a
grim
misshapen
body
of
cloud
in
the
very
teeth
of
the
wind
so
unnaturally
did
it
rise
that
one
could
fancy
it
to
be
lifted
by
machinery
from
below
meanwhile
the
faint
cloudlets
had
flown
back
into
the
corner
of
the
sky
as
if
in
terror
of
the
large
cloud
like
a
young
brood
gazed
in
upon
by
some
monster
going
on
to
the
village
oak
flung
a
small
stone
against
the
window
of
laban
bedroom
expecting
susan
to
open
it
but
nobody
stirred
he
went
round
to
the
back
door
which
had
been
left
unfastened
for
entry
and
passed
in
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
tall
come
for
the
key
of
the
granary
to
get
at
the
said
oak
in
a
stentorian
voice
that
you
said
susan
tall
half
awake
said
gabriel
along
to
bed
do
you
drawlatching
a
body
awake
like
this
gabriel
oak
i
want
the
key
of
the
what
in
the
name
of
fortune
did
you
pretend
to
be
laban
for
i
thought
you
you
did
what
do
you
want
here
key
of
the
it
then
on
the
nail
people
coming
disturbing
women
at
this
time
of
night
gabriel
took
the
key
without
waiting
to
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
tirade
ten
minutes
later
his
lonely
figure
might
have
been
seen
dragging
four
large
coverings
across
the
yard
and
soon
two
of
these
heaps
of
treasure
in
grain
were
covered
cloths
to
each
two
hundred
pounds
were
secured
three
remained
open
and
there
were
no
more
cloths
oak
looked
under
the
staddles
and
found
a
fork
he
mounted
the
third
pile
of
wealth
and
began
operating
adopting
the
plan
of
sloping
the
upper
sheaves
one
over
the
other
and
in
addition
filling
the
interstices
with
the
material
of
some
untied
sheaves
so
far
all
was
well
by
this
hurried
contrivance
property
in
wheat
was
safe
for
at
any
rate
a
week
or
two
provided
always
that
there
was
not
much
wind
next
came
the
barley
this
it
was
only
possible
to
protect
by
systematic
thatching
time
went
on
and
the
moon
vanished
not
to
reappear
it
was
the
farewell
of
the
ambassador
previous
to
war
the
night
had
a
haggard
look
like
a
sick
thing
and
there
came
finally
an
utter
expiration
of
air
from
the
whole
heaven
in
the
form
of
a
slow
breeze
which
might
have
been
likened
to
a
death
and
now
nothing
was
heard
in
the
yard
but
the
dull
thuds
of
the
beetle
which
drove
in
the
spars
and
the
rustle
of
thatch
in
the
intervals
chapter
xxxvii
the
two
together
a
light
flapped
over
the
scene
as
if
reflected
from
phosphorescent
wings
crossing
the
sky
and
a
rumble
filled
the
air
it
was
the
first
move
of
the
approaching
storm
the
second
peal
was
noisy
with
comparatively
little
visible
lightning
gabriel
saw
a
candle
shining
in
bedroom
and
soon
a
shadow
swept
to
and
fro
upon
the
blind
then
there
came
a
third
flash
manœuvres
of
a
most
extraordinary
kind
were
going
on
in
the
vast
firmamental
hollows
overhead
the
lightning
now
was
the
colour
of
silver
and
gleamed
in
the
heavens
like
a
mailed
army
rumbles
became
rattles
gabriel
from
his
elevated
position
could
see
over
the
landscape
at
least
miles
in
front
every
hedge
bush
and
tree
was
distinct
as
in
a
line
engraving
in
a
paddock
in
the
same
direction
was
a
herd
of
heifers
and
the
forms
of
these
were
visible
at
this
moment
in
the
act
of
galloping
about
in
the
wildest
and
maddest
confusion
flinging
their
heels
and
tails
high
into
the
air
their
heads
to
earth
a
poplar
in
the
immediate
foreground
was
like
an
ink
stroke
on
burnished
tin
then
the
picture
vanished
leaving
the
darkness
so
intense
that
gabriel
worked
entirely
by
feeling
with
his
hands
he
had
stuck
his
or
poniard
as
it
was
indifferently
long
iron
lance
polished
by
the
stack
used
to
support
the
sheaves
instead
of
the
support
called
a
groom
used
on
houses
a
blue
light
appeared
in
the
zenith
and
in
some
indescribable
manner
flickered
down
near
the
top
of
the
rod
it
was
the
fourth
of
the
larger
flashes
a
moment
later
and
there
was
a
clear
and
short
gabriel
felt
his
position
to
be
anything
but
a
safe
one
and
he
resolved
to
descend
not
a
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
as
yet
he
wiped
his
weary
brow
and
looked
again
at
the
black
forms
of
the
unprotected
stacks
was
his
life
so
valuable
to
him
after
all
what
were
his
prospects
that
he
should
be
so
chary
of
running
risk
when
important
and
urgent
labour
could
not
be
carried
on
without
such
risk
he
resolved
to
stick
to
the
stack
however
he
took
a
precaution
under
the
staddles
was
a
long
tethering
chain
used
to
prevent
the
escape
of
errant
horses
this
he
carried
up
the
ladder
and
sticking
his
rod
through
the
clog
at
one
end
allowed
the
other
end
of
the
chain
to
trail
upon
the
ground
the
spike
attached
to
it
he
drove
in
under
the
shadow
of
this
extemporized
he
felt
himself
comparatively
safe
before
oak
had
laid
his
hands
upon
his
tools
again
out
leapt
the
fifth
flash
with
the
spring
of
a
serpent
and
the
shout
of
a
fiend
it
was
green
as
an
emerald
and
the
reverberation
was
stunning
what
was
this
the
light
revealed
to
him
in
the
open
ground
before
him
as
he
looked
over
the
ridge
of
the
rick
was
a
dark
and
apparently
female
form
could
it
be
that
of
the
only
venturesome
woman
in
the
the
form
moved
on
a
step
then
he
could
see
no
more
that
you
said
gabriel
to
the
darkness
is
there
said
the
voice
of
bathsheba
i
am
on
the
rick
gabriel
are
you
i
have
come
about
them
the
weather
awoke
me
and
i
thought
of
the
corn
i
am
so
distressed
about
we
save
it
anyhow
i
can
not
find
my
husband
is
he
with
you
is
not
you
know
where
he
is
in
the
promised
that
the
stacks
should
be
seen
to
and
now
they
are
all
neglected
can
i
do
anything
to
help
liddy
is
afraid
to
come
out
fancy
finding
you
here
at
such
an
hour
surely
i
can
do
something
can
bring
up
some
to
me
one
by
one
if
you
are
not
afraid
to
come
up
the
ladder
in
the
dark
said
gabriel
moment
is
precious
now
and
that
would
save
a
good
deal
of
time
it
is
not
very
dark
when
the
lightning
has
been
gone
a
do
anything
she
said
resolutely
she
instantly
took
a
sheaf
upon
her
shoulder
clambered
up
close
to
his
heels
placed
it
behind
the
rod
and
descended
for
another
at
her
third
ascent
the
rick
suddenly
brightened
with
the
brazen
glare
of
shining
knot
in
every
straw
was
visible
on
the
slope
in
front
of
him
appeared
two
human
shapes
black
as
jet
the
rick
lost
its
shapes
vanished
gabriel
turned
his
head
it
had
been
the
sixth
flash
which
had
come
from
the
east
behind
him
and
the
two
dark
forms
on
the
slope
had
been
the
shadows
of
himself
and
bathsheba
then
came
the
peal
it
hardly
was
credible
that
such
a
heavenly
light
could
be
the
parent
of
such
a
diabolical
sound
terrible
she
exclaimed
and
clutched
him
by
the
sleeve
gabriel
turned
and
steadied
her
on
her
aerial
perch
by
holding
her
arm
at
the
same
moment
while
he
was
still
reversed
in
his
attitude
there
was
more
light
and
he
saw
as
it
were
a
copy
of
the
tall
poplar
tree
on
the
hill
drawn
in
black
on
the
wall
of
the
barn
it
was
the
shadow
of
that
tree
thrown
across
by
a
secondary
flash
in
the
west
the
next
flare
came
bathsheba
was
on
the
ground
now
shouldering
another
sheaf
and
she
bore
its
dazzle
without
and
again
ascended
with
the
load
there
was
then
a
silence
everywhere
for
four
or
five
minutes
and
the
crunch
of
the
spars
as
gabriel
hastily
drove
them
in
could
again
be
distinctly
heard
he
thought
the
crisis
of
the
storm
had
passed
but
there
came
a
burst
of
light
on
said
gabriel
taking
the
sheaf
from
her
shoulder
and
grasping
her
arm
again
heaven
opened
then
indeed
the
flash
was
almost
too
novel
for
its
inexpressibly
dangerous
nature
to
be
at
once
realized
and
they
could
only
comprehend
the
magnificence
of
its
beauty
it
sprang
from
east
west
north
south
and
was
a
perfect
dance
of
death
the
forms
of
skeletons
appeared
in
the
air
shaped
with
blue
fire
for
leaping
striding
racing
around
and
mingling
altogether
in
unparalleled
confusion
with
these
were
intertwined
undulating
snakes
of
green
and
behind
these
was
a
broad
mass
of
lesser
light
simultaneously
came
from
every
part
of
the
tumbling
sky
what
may
be
called
a
shout
since
though
no
shout
ever
came
near
it
it
was
more
of
the
nature
of
a
shout
than
of
anything
else
earthly
in
the
meantime
one
of
the
grisly
forms
had
alighted
upon
the
point
of
rod
to
run
invisibly
down
it
down
the
chain
and
into
the
earth
gabriel
was
almost
blinded
and
he
could
feel
warm
arm
tremble
in
his
sensation
novel
and
thrilling
enough
but
love
life
everything
human
seemed
small
and
trifling
in
such
close
juxtaposition
with
an
infuriated
universe
oak
had
hardly
time
to
gather
up
these
impressions
into
a
thought
and
to
see
how
strangely
the
red
feather
of
her
hat
shone
in
this
light
when
the
tall
tree
on
the
hill
before
mentioned
seemed
on
fire
to
a
white
heat
and
a
new
one
among
these
terrible
voices
mingled
with
the
last
crash
of
those
preceding
it
was
a
stupefying
blast
harsh
and
pitiless
and
it
fell
upon
their
ears
in
a
dead
flat
blow
without
that
reverberation
which
lends
the
tones
of
a
drum
to
more
distant
thunder
by
the
lustre
reflected
from
every
part
of
the
earth
and
from
the
wide
domical
scoop
above
it
he
saw
that
the
tree
was
sliced
down
the
whole
length
of
its
tall
straight
stem
a
huge
riband
of
bark
being
apparently
flung
off
the
other
portion
remained
erect
and
revealed
the
bared
surface
as
a
strip
of
white
down
the
front
the
lightning
had
struck
the
tree
a
sulphurous
smell
filled
the
air
then
all
was
silent
and
black
as
a
cave
in
hinnom
had
a
narrow
escape
said
gabriel
hurriedly
had
better
go
bathsheba
said
nothing
but
he
could
distinctly
hear
her
rhythmical
pants
and
the
recurrent
rustle
of
the
sheaf
beside
her
in
response
to
her
frightened
pulsations
she
descended
the
ladder
and
on
second
thoughts
he
followed
her
the
darkness
was
now
impenetrable
by
the
sharpest
vision
they
both
stood
still
at
the
bottom
side
by
side
bathsheba
appeared
to
think
only
of
the
thought
only
of
her
just
then
at
last
he
storm
seems
to
have
passed
now
at
any
think
so
too
said
bathsheba
there
are
multitudes
of
gleams
look
the
sky
was
now
filled
with
an
incessant
light
frequent
repetition
melting
into
complete
continuity
as
an
unbroken
sound
results
from
the
successive
strokes
on
a
gong
serious
said
he
can
not
understand
no
rain
falling
but
heaven
be
praised
it
is
all
the
better
for
us
i
am
now
going
up
you
are
kinder
than
i
deserve
i
will
stay
and
help
you
yet
oh
why
are
not
some
of
the
others
here
would
have
been
here
if
they
could
said
oak
in
a
hesitating
way
i
know
it
she
said
adding
slowly
are
all
asleep
in
the
barn
in
a
drunken
sleep
and
my
husband
among
them
it
is
it
not
think
i
am
a
timid
woman
and
endure
am
not
certain
said
gabriel
will
go
and
he
crossed
to
the
barn
leaving
her
there
alone
he
looked
through
the
chinks
of
the
door
all
was
in
total
darkness
as
he
had
left
it
and
there
still
arose
as
at
the
former
time
the
steady
buzz
of
many
snores
he
felt
a
zephyr
curling
about
his
cheek
and
turned
it
was
had
followed
him
and
was
looking
into
the
same
chink
he
endeavoured
to
put
off
the
immediate
and
painful
subject
of
their
thoughts
by
remarking
gently
come
back
again
and
hand
up
a
few
more
it
would
save
much
then
oak
went
back
again
ascended
to
the
top
stepped
off
the
ladder
for
greater
expedition
and
went
on
thatching
she
followed
but
without
a
sheaf
she
said
in
a
strange
and
impressive
voice
oak
looked
up
at
her
she
had
not
spoken
since
he
left
the
barn
the
soft
and
continual
shimmer
of
the
dying
lightning
showed
a
marble
face
high
against
the
black
sky
of
the
opposite
quarter
bathsheba
was
sitting
almost
on
the
apex
of
the
stack
her
feet
gathered
up
beneath
her
and
resting
on
the
top
round
of
the
ladder
mistress
he
said
suppose
you
thought
that
when
i
galloped
away
to
bath
that
night
it
was
on
purpose
to
be
married
did
at
at
first
he
answered
somewhat
surprised
at
the
abruptness
with
which
this
new
subject
was
broached
others
thought
so
too
you
blamed
me
for
it
thought
so
now
i
care
a
little
for
your
good
opinion
and
i
want
to
explain
have
longed
to
do
it
ever
since
i
returned
and
you
looked
so
gravely
at
me
for
if
i
were
to
i
may
die
would
be
dreadful
that
you
should
always
think
mistakenly
of
me
now
gabriel
ceased
his
rustling
went
to
bath
that
night
in
the
full
intention
of
breaking
off
my
engagement
to
mr
troy
it
was
owing
to
circumstances
which
occurred
after
i
got
there
we
were
married
now
do
you
see
the
matter
in
a
new
light
must
i
suppose
say
more
now
that
i
have
begun
and
perhaps
no
harm
for
you
are
certainly
under
no
delusion
that
i
ever
loved
you
or
that
i
can
have
any
object
in
speaking
more
than
that
object
i
have
mentioned
well
i
was
alone
in
a
strange
city
and
the
horse
was
lame
and
at
last
i
know
what
to
do
i
saw
when
it
was
too
late
that
scandal
might
seize
hold
of
me
for
meeting
him
alone
in
that
way
but
i
was
coming
away
when
he
suddenly
said
he
had
that
day
seen
a
woman
more
beautiful
than
i
and
that
his
constancy
could
not
be
counted
on
unless
i
at
once
became
his
and
i
was
grieved
and
she
cleared
her
voice
and
waited
a
moment
as
if
to
gather
breath
then
between
jealousy
and
distraction
i
married
him
she
whispered
with
desperate
impetuosity
gabriel
made
no
reply
was
not
to
blame
for
it
was
perfectly
true
his
seeing
somebody
else
she
quickly
added
now
i
wish
for
a
single
remark
from
you
upon
the
i
forbid
it
i
only
wanted
you
to
know
that
misunderstood
bit
of
my
history
before
a
time
comes
when
you
could
never
know
want
some
more
sheaves
she
went
down
the
ladder
and
the
work
proceeded
gabriel
soon
perceived
a
languor
in
the
movements
of
his
mistress
up
and
down
and
he
said
to
her
gently
as
a
think
you
had
better
go
indoors
now
you
are
tired
i
can
finish
the
rest
alone
if
the
wind
does
not
change
the
rain
is
likely
to
keep
i
am
useless
i
will
go
said
bathsheba
in
a
flagging
cadence
o
if
your
life
should
be
lost
are
not
useless
but
i
would
rather
not
tire
you
longer
you
have
done
you
better
she
said
gratefully
you
for
your
devotion
a
thousand
times
gabriel
know
you
are
doing
your
very
best
for
she
diminished
in
the
gloom
and
vanished
and
he
heard
the
latch
of
the
gate
fall
as
she
passed
through
he
worked
in
a
reverie
now
musing
upon
her
story
and
upon
the
contradictoriness
of
that
feminine
heart
which
had
caused
her
to
speak
more
warmly
to
him
than
she
ever
had
done
whilst
unmarried
and
free
to
speak
as
warmly
as
she
chose
he
was
disturbed
in
his
meditation
by
a
grating
noise
from
the
it
was
the
vane
on
the
roof
turning
round
and
this
change
in
the
wind
was
the
signal
for
a
disastrous
rain
chapter
xxxviii
solitary
meets
another
it
was
now
five
and
the
dawn
was
promising
to
break
in
hues
of
drab
and
ash
the
air
changed
its
temperature
and
stirred
itself
more
vigorously
cool
breezes
coursed
in
transparent
eddies
round
face
the
wind
shifted
yet
a
point
or
two
and
blew
stronger
in
ten
minutes
every
wind
of
heaven
seemed
to
be
roaming
at
large
some
of
the
thatching
on
the
was
now
whirled
fantastically
aloft
and
had
to
be
replaced
and
weighted
with
some
rails
that
lay
near
at
hand
this
done
oak
slaved
away
again
at
the
barley
a
huge
drop
of
rain
smote
his
face
the
wind
snarled
round
every
corner
the
trees
rocked
to
the
bases
of
their
trunks
and
the
twigs
clashed
in
strife
driving
in
spars
at
any
point
and
on
any
system
inch
by
inch
he
covered
more
and
more
safely
from
ruin
this
distracting
impersonation
of
seven
hundred
pounds
the
rain
came
on
in
earnest
and
oak
soon
felt
the
water
to
be
tracking
cold
and
clammy
routes
down
his
back
ultimately
he
was
reduced
to
a
homogeneous
sop
and
the
dyes
of
his
clothes
trickled
down
and
stood
in
a
pool
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
the
rain
stretched
obliquely
through
the
dull
atmosphere
in
liquid
spines
unbroken
in
continuity
between
their
beginnings
in
the
clouds
and
their
points
in
him
oak
suddenly
remembered
that
eight
months
before
this
time
he
had
been
fighting
against
fire
in
the
same
spot
as
desperately
as
he
was
fighting
against
water
for
a
futile
love
of
the
same
woman
as
for
oak
was
generous
and
true
and
dismissed
his
reflections
it
was
about
seven
in
the
dark
leaden
morning
when
gabriel
came
down
from
the
last
stack
and
thankfully
exclaimed
is
done
he
was
drenched
weary
and
sad
and
yet
not
so
sad
as
drenched
and
weary
for
he
was
cheered
by
a
sense
of
success
in
a
good
cause
faint
sounds
came
from
the
barn
and
he
looked
that
way
figures
stepped
singly
and
in
pairs
through
the
walking
awkwardly
and
abashed
save
the
foremost
who
wore
a
red
jacket
and
advanced
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
whistling
the
others
shambled
after
with
a
air
the
whole
procession
was
not
unlike
group
of
the
suitors
tottering
on
towards
the
infernal
regions
under
the
conduct
of
mercury
the
gnarled
shapes
passed
into
the
village
troy
their
leader
entering
the
farmhouse
not
a
single
one
of
them
had
turned
his
face
to
the
ricks
or
apparently
bestowed
one
thought
upon
their
condition
soon
oak
too
went
homeward
by
a
different
route
from
theirs
in
front
of
him
against
the
wet
glazed
surface
of
the
lane
he
saw
a
person
walking
yet
more
slowly
than
himself
under
an
umbrella
the
man
turned
and
plainly
started
he
was
boldwood
are
you
this
morning
sir
said
oak
it
is
a
wet
i
am
well
very
well
i
thank
you
quite
am
glad
to
hear
it
boldwood
seemed
to
awake
to
the
present
by
degrees
look
tired
and
ill
oak
he
said
then
desultorily
regarding
his
companion
am
tired
you
look
strangely
altered
not
a
bit
of
it
i
am
well
enough
what
put
that
into
your
head
thought
you
look
quite
so
topping
as
you
used
to
that
was
then
you
are
mistaken
said
boldwood
shortly
hurts
me
my
constitution
is
an
iron
been
working
hard
to
get
our
ricks
covered
and
was
barely
in
time
never
had
such
a
struggle
in
my
life
yours
of
course
are
safe
yes
boldwood
added
after
an
interval
of
silence
did
you
ask
oak
ricks
are
all
covered
before
this
time
any
rate
the
large
ones
upon
the
stone
staddles
are
under
the
hedge
i
forgot
to
tell
the
thatcher
to
set
about
the
little
one
by
the
stile
the
little
one
by
the
stile
i
overlooked
the
ricks
this
not
a
tenth
of
your
corn
will
come
to
measure
them
repeated
gabriel
slowly
to
himself
it
is
difficult
to
describe
the
intensely
dramatic
effect
that
announcement
had
upon
oak
at
such
a
moment
all
the
night
he
had
been
feeling
that
the
neglect
he
was
labouring
to
repair
was
abnormal
and
only
instance
of
the
kind
within
the
circuit
of
the
county
yet
at
this
very
time
within
the
same
parish
a
greater
waste
had
been
going
on
uncomplained
of
and
disregarded
a
few
months
earlier
forgetting
his
husbandry
would
have
been
as
preposterous
an
idea
as
a
sailor
forgetting
he
was
in
a
ship
oak
was
just
thinking
that
whatever
he
himself
might
have
suffered
from
marriage
here
was
a
man
who
had
suffered
more
when
boldwood
spoke
in
a
changed
of
one
who
yearned
to
make
a
confidence
and
relieve
his
heart
by
an
outpouring
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
things
have
gone
wrong
with
me
lately
i
may
as
well
own
it
i
was
going
to
get
a
little
settled
in
life
but
in
some
way
my
plan
has
come
to
thought
my
mistress
would
have
married
you
said
gabriel
not
knowing
enough
of
the
full
depths
of
love
to
keep
silence
on
the
account
and
determined
not
to
evade
discipline
by
doing
so
on
his
own
it
is
so
sometimes
and
nothing
happens
that
we
expect
he
added
with
the
repose
of
a
man
whom
misfortune
had
inured
rather
than
subdued
daresay
i
am
a
joke
about
the
parish
said
boldwood
as
if
the
subject
came
irresistibly
to
his
tongue
and
with
a
miserable
lightness
meant
to
express
his
indifference
think
the
real
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
there
was
not
as
some
fancy
any
jilting
part
no
engagement
ever
existed
between
me
and
miss
everdene
people
say
so
but
it
is
untrue
she
never
promised
me
boldwood
stood
still
now
and
turned
his
wild
face
to
oak
gabriel
he
continued
am
weak
and
foolish
and
i
know
what
and
i
fend
off
my
miserable
grief
i
had
some
faint
belief
in
the
mercy
of
god
till
i
lost
that
woman
yes
he
prepared
a
gourd
to
shade
me
and
like
the
prophet
i
thanked
him
and
was
glad
but
the
next
day
he
prepared
a
worm
to
smite
the
gourd
and
wither
it
and
i
feel
it
is
better
to
die
than
to
live
a
silence
followed
boldwood
aroused
himself
from
the
momentary
mood
of
confidence
into
which
he
had
drifted
and
walked
on
again
resuming
his
usual
reserve
gabriel
he
resumed
with
a
carelessness
which
was
like
the
smile
on
the
countenance
of
a
skull
was
made
more
of
by
other
people
than
ever
it
was
by
us
i
do
feel
a
little
regret
occasionally
but
no
woman
ever
had
power
over
me
for
any
length
of
time
well
good
morning
i
can
trust
you
not
to
mention
to
others
what
has
passed
between
us
two
chapter
xxxix
coming
cry
on
the
turnpike
road
between
casterbridge
and
weatherbury
and
about
three
miles
from
the
former
place
is
yalbury
hill
one
of
those
steep
long
ascents
which
pervade
the
highways
of
this
undulating
part
of
south
wessex
in
returning
from
market
it
is
usual
for
the
farmers
and
other
to
alight
at
the
bottom
and
walk
up
one
saturday
evening
in
the
month
of
october
vehicle
was
duly
creeping
up
this
incline
she
was
sitting
listlessly
in
the
second
seat
of
the
gig
whilst
walking
beside
her
in
a
marketing
suit
of
unusually
fashionable
cut
was
an
erect
young
man
though
on
foot
he
held
the
reins
and
whip
and
occasionally
aimed
light
cuts
at
the
ear
with
the
end
of
the
lash
as
a
recreation
this
man
was
her
husband
formerly
sergeant
troy
who
having
bought
his
discharge
with
money
was
gradually
transforming
himself
into
a
farmer
of
a
spirited
and
very
modern
school
people
of
unalterable
ideas
still
insisted
upon
calling
him
when
they
met
him
which
was
in
some
degree
owing
to
his
having
still
retained
the
moustache
of
his
military
days
and
the
soldierly
bearing
inseparable
from
his
form
and
training
if
it
been
for
that
wretched
rain
i
should
have
cleared
two
hundred
as
easy
as
looking
my
love
he
was
saying
you
see
it
altered
all
the
chances
to
speak
like
a
book
i
once
read
wet
weather
is
the
narrative
and
fine
days
are
the
episodes
of
our
history
now
that
true
the
time
of
year
is
come
for
changeable
yes
the
fact
is
these
autumn
races
are
the
ruin
of
everybody
never
did
i
see
such
a
day
as
a
wild
open
place
just
out
of
budmouth
and
a
drab
sea
rolled
in
towards
us
like
liquid
misery
wind
and
lord
dark
why
as
black
as
my
hat
before
the
last
race
was
run
five
and
you
see
the
horses
till
they
were
almost
in
leave
alone
colours
the
ground
was
as
heavy
as
lead
and
all
judgment
from
a
experience
went
for
nothing
horses
riders
people
were
all
blown
about
like
ships
at
sea
three
booths
were
blown
over
and
the
wretched
folk
inside
crawled
out
upon
their
hands
and
knees
and
in
the
next
field
were
as
many
as
a
dozen
hats
at
one
time
ay
pimpernel
regularly
stuck
fast
when
about
sixty
yards
off
and
when
i
saw
policy
stepping
on
it
did
knock
my
heart
against
the
lining
of
my
ribs
i
assure
you
my
love
you
mean
frank
said
bathsheba
voice
was
painfully
lowered
from
the
fulness
and
vivacity
of
the
previous
you
have
lost
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
in
a
month
by
this
dreadful
o
frank
it
is
cruel
it
is
foolish
of
you
to
take
away
my
money
so
we
shall
have
to
leave
the
farm
that
will
be
the
end
of
it
about
cruel
now
there
on
the
waterworks
just
like
promise
me
not
to
go
to
budmouth
second
meeting
you
she
implored
bathsheba
was
at
the
full
depth
for
tears
but
she
maintained
a
dry
eye
see
why
i
should
in
fact
if
it
turns
out
to
be
a
fine
day
i
was
thinking
of
taking
never
go
a
hundred
miles
the
other
way
first
i
hate
the
sound
of
the
very
word
the
question
of
going
to
see
the
race
or
staying
at
home
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
matter
bets
are
all
booked
safely
enough
before
the
race
begins
you
may
depend
whether
it
is
a
bad
race
for
me
or
a
good
one
will
have
very
little
to
do
with
our
going
there
next
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
risked
anything
on
this
one
too
she
exclaimed
with
an
agonized
look
now
you
be
a
little
fool
wait
till
you
are
told
why
bathsheba
you
have
lost
all
the
pluck
and
sauciness
you
formerly
had
and
upon
my
life
if
i
had
known
what
a
creature
you
were
under
all
your
boldness
never
know
a
flash
of
indignation
might
have
been
seen
in
dark
eyes
as
she
looked
resolutely
ahead
after
this
reply
they
moved
on
without
further
speech
some
leaves
from
the
trees
which
hooded
the
road
at
this
spot
occasionally
spinning
downward
across
their
path
to
the
earth
a
woman
appeared
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
ridge
was
in
a
cutting
so
that
she
was
very
near
the
husband
and
wife
before
she
became
visible
troy
had
turned
towards
the
gig
to
remount
and
whilst
putting
his
foot
on
the
step
the
woman
passed
behind
him
though
the
overshadowing
trees
and
the
approach
of
eventide
enveloped
them
in
gloom
bathsheba
could
see
plainly
enough
to
discern
the
extreme
poverty
of
the
garb
and
the
sadness
of
her
face
sir
do
you
know
at
what
time
casterbridge
closes
at
night
the
woman
said
these
words
to
troy
over
his
shoulder
troy
started
visibly
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
yet
he
seemed
to
recover
presence
of
mind
sufficient
to
prevent
himself
from
giving
way
to
his
impulse
to
suddenly
turn
and
face
her
he
said
the
woman
on
hearing
him
speak
quickly
looked
up
examined
the
side
of
his
face
and
recognized
the
soldier
under
the
garb
her
face
was
drawn
into
an
expression
which
had
gladness
and
agony
both
among
its
elements
she
uttered
an
hysterical
cry
and
fell
down
poor
thing
exclaimed
bathsheba
instantly
preparing
to
alight
where
you
are
and
attend
to
the
horse
said
troy
peremptorily
throwing
her
the
reins
and
the
whip
the
horse
to
the
top
see
to
the
you
hear
the
horse
gig
and
bathsheba
moved
on
on
earth
did
you
come
here
i
thought
you
were
miles
away
or
dead
why
you
write
to
me
said
troy
to
the
woman
in
a
strangely
gentle
yet
hurried
voice
as
he
lifted
her
up
feared
you
any
money
wish
i
had
more
to
give
you
merest
trifle
it
is
every
farthing
i
have
left
i
have
none
but
what
my
wife
gives
me
you
know
and
i
ask
her
the
woman
made
no
answer
have
only
another
moment
continued
troy
now
listen
where
are
you
going
casterbridge
union
i
thought
to
go
go
there
yet
wait
yes
perhaps
for
i
can
do
nothing
luck
sleep
there
and
stay
there
monday
is
the
first
free
day
i
have
and
on
monday
morning
at
ten
exactly
meet
me
on
bridge
just
out
of
the
town
bring
all
the
money
i
can
muster
you
see
that
fanny
then
get
you
a
lodging
somewhere
till
then
i
am
a
after
advancing
the
distance
which
completed
the
ascent
of
the
hill
bathsheba
turned
her
head
the
woman
was
upon
her
feet
and
bathsheba
saw
her
withdrawing
from
troy
and
going
feebly
down
the
hill
by
the
third
milestone
from
casterbridge
troy
then
came
on
towards
his
wife
stepped
into
the
gig
took
the
reins
from
her
hand
and
without
making
any
observation
whipped
the
horse
into
a
trot
he
was
rather
agitated
you
know
who
that
woman
was
said
bathsheba
looking
searchingly
into
his
face
do
he
said
looking
boldly
back
into
hers
thought
you
did
said
she
with
angry
hauteur
and
still
regarding
him
is
she
he
suddenly
seemed
to
think
that
frankness
would
benefit
neither
of
the
women
to
either
of
us
he
said
know
her
by
is
her
name
should
i
know
her
name
think
you
if
you
will
and
the
sentence
was
completed
by
a
smart
cut
of
the
whip
round
flank
which
caused
the
animal
to
start
forward
at
a
wild
pace
no
more
was
said
chapter
xl
on
casterbridge
highway
for
a
considerable
time
the
woman
walked
on
her
steps
became
feebler
and
she
strained
her
eyes
to
look
afar
upon
the
naked
road
now
indistinct
amid
the
penumbræ
of
night
at
length
her
onward
walk
dwindled
to
the
merest
totter
and
she
opened
a
gate
within
which
was
a
haystack
underneath
this
she
sat
down
and
presently
slept
when
the
woman
awoke
it
was
to
find
herself
in
the
depths
of
a
moonless
and
starless
night
a
heavy
unbroken
crust
of
cloud
stretched
across
the
sky
shutting
out
every
speck
of
heaven
and
a
distant
halo
which
hung
over
the
town
of
casterbridge
was
visible
against
the
black
concave
the
luminosity
appearing
the
brighter
by
its
great
contrast
with
the
circumscribing
darkness
towards
this
weak
soft
glow
the
woman
turned
her
eyes
i
could
only
get
there
she
said
him
the
day
after
god
help
me
perhaps
i
shall
be
in
my
grave
before
a
clock
from
the
far
depths
of
shadow
struck
the
hour
one
in
a
small
attenuated
tone
after
midnight
the
voice
of
a
clock
seems
to
lose
in
breadth
as
much
as
in
length
and
to
diminish
its
sonorousness
to
a
thin
falsetto
afterwards
a
from
the
remote
shade
and
grew
larger
a
carriage
rolled
along
the
road
and
passed
the
gate
it
probably
contained
some
late
the
beams
from
one
lamp
shone
for
a
moment
upon
the
crouching
woman
and
threw
her
face
into
vivid
relief
the
face
was
young
in
the
groundwork
old
in
the
finish
the
general
contours
were
flexuous
and
childlike
but
the
finer
lineaments
had
begun
to
be
sharp
and
thin
the
pedestrian
stood
up
apparently
with
revived
determination
and
looked
around
the
road
appeared
to
be
familiar
to
her
and
she
carefully
scanned
the
fence
as
she
slowly
walked
along
presently
there
became
visible
a
dim
white
shape
it
was
another
milestone
she
drew
her
fingers
across
its
face
to
feel
the
marks
more
she
said
she
leant
against
the
stone
as
a
means
of
rest
for
a
short
interval
then
bestirred
herself
and
again
pursued
her
way
for
a
slight
distance
she
bore
up
bravely
afterwards
flagging
as
before
this
was
beside
a
lone
copsewood
wherein
heaps
of
white
chips
strewn
upon
the
leafy
ground
showed
that
woodmen
had
been
faggoting
and
making
hurdles
during
the
day
now
there
was
not
a
rustle
not
a
breeze
not
the
faintest
clash
of
twigs
to
keep
her
company
the
woman
looked
over
the
gate
opened
it
and
went
in
close
to
the
entrance
stood
a
row
of
faggots
bound
and
unbound
together
with
stakes
of
all
sizes
for
a
few
seconds
the
wayfarer
stood
with
that
tense
stillness
which
signifies
itself
to
be
not
the
end
but
merely
the
suspension
of
a
previous
motion
her
attitude
was
that
of
a
person
who
listens
either
to
the
external
world
of
sound
or
to
the
imagined
discourse
of
thought
a
close
criticism
might
have
detected
signs
proving
that
she
was
intent
on
the
latter
alternative
moreover
as
was
shown
by
what
followed
she
was
oddly
exercising
the
faculty
of
invention
upon
the
speciality
of
the
clever
jacquet
droz
the
designer
of
automatic
substitutes
for
human
limbs
by
the
aid
of
the
casterbridge
aurora
and
by
feeling
with
her
hands
the
woman
selected
two
sticks
from
the
heaps
these
sticks
were
nearly
straight
to
the
height
of
three
or
four
feet
where
each
branched
into
a
fork
like
the
letter
y
she
sat
down
snapped
off
the
small
upper
twigs
and
carried
the
remainder
with
her
into
the
road
she
placed
one
of
these
forks
under
each
arm
as
a
crutch
tested
them
timidly
threw
her
whole
weight
upon
little
that
it
swung
herself
forward
the
girl
had
made
for
herself
a
material
aid
the
crutches
answered
well
the
pat
of
her
feet
and
the
tap
of
her
sticks
upon
the
highway
were
all
the
sounds
that
came
from
the
traveller
now
she
had
passed
the
last
milestone
by
a
good
long
distance
and
began
to
look
wistfully
towards
the
bank
as
if
calculating
upon
another
milestone
soon
the
crutches
though
so
very
useful
had
their
limits
of
power
mechanism
only
transfers
labour
being
powerless
to
supersede
it
and
the
original
amount
of
exertion
was
not
cleared
away
it
was
thrown
into
the
body
and
arms
she
was
exhausted
and
each
swing
forward
became
fainter
at
last
she
swayed
sideways
and
fell
here
she
lay
a
shapeless
heap
for
ten
minutes
and
more
the
morning
wind
began
to
boom
dully
over
the
flats
and
to
move
afresh
dead
leaves
which
had
lain
still
since
yesterday
the
woman
desperately
turned
round
upon
her
knees
and
next
rose
to
her
feet
steadying
herself
by
the
help
of
one
crutch
she
essayed
a
step
then
another
then
a
third
using
the
crutches
now
as
only
thus
she
progressed
till
descending
mellstock
hill
another
milestone
appeared
and
soon
the
beginning
of
an
fence
came
into
view
she
staggered
across
to
the
first
post
clung
to
it
and
looked
around
the
casterbridge
lights
were
now
individually
visible
it
was
getting
towards
morning
and
vehicles
might
be
hoped
for
if
not
expected
soon
she
listened
there
was
not
a
sound
of
life
save
that
acme
and
sublimation
of
all
dismal
sounds
the
bark
of
a
fox
its
three
hollow
notes
being
rendered
at
intervals
of
a
minute
with
the
precision
of
a
funeral
bell
than
a
mile
the
woman
murmured
more
she
added
after
a
pause
mile
is
to
the
county
hall
and
my
is
on
the
other
side
casterbridge
a
little
over
a
mile
and
there
i
am
after
an
interval
she
again
spoke
or
six
steps
to
a
perhaps
i
have
to
go
seventeen
hundred
yards
a
hundred
times
six
six
hundred
seventeen
times
that
o
pity
me
lord
holding
to
the
rails
she
advanced
thrusting
one
hand
forward
upon
the
rail
then
the
other
then
leaning
over
it
whilst
she
dragged
her
feet
on
beneath
this
woman
was
not
given
to
soliloquy
but
extremity
of
feeling
lessens
the
individuality
of
the
weak
as
it
increases
that
of
the
strong
she
said
again
in
the
same
tone
believe
that
the
end
lies
five
posts
forward
and
no
further
and
so
get
strength
to
pass
this
was
a
practical
application
of
the
principle
that
a
and
fictitious
faith
is
better
than

stone
bridge
is
the
end
of
my
journey
she
said
when
the
bridge
over
the
froom
was
in
view
she
crawled
to
the
bridge
during
the
effort
each
breath
of
the
woman
went
into
the
air
as
if
never
to
return
again
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
she
said
sitting
down
truth
is
that
i
have
less
than
half
a
with
what
she
had
known
all
the
time
to
be
false
had
given
her
strength
to
come
over
half
a
mile
that
she
would
have
been
powerless
to
face
in
the
lump
the
artifice
showed
that
the
woman
by
some
mysterious
intuition
had
grasped
the
paradoxical
truth
that
blindness
may
operate
more
vigorously
than
prescience
and
the
effect
more
than
the
that
limitation
and
not
comprehensiveness
is
needed
for
striking
a
blow
the
stood
now
before
the
sick
and
weary
woman
like
a
stolid
juggernaut
it
was
an
impassive
king
of
her
world
the
road
here
ran
across
durnover
moor
open
to
the
road
on
either
side
she
surveyed
the
wide
space
the
lights
herself
sighed
and
lay
down
against
a
of
the
bridge
never
was
ingenuity
exercised
so
sorely
as
the
traveller
here
exercised
hers
every
conceivable
aid
method
stratagem
mechanism
by
which
these
last
desperate
eight
hundred
yards
could
be
overpassed
by
a
human
being
unperceived
was
revolved
in
her
busy
brain
and
dismissed
as
impracticable
she
thought
of
sticks
wheels
even
thought
of
rolling
but
the
exertion
demanded
by
either
of
these
latter
two
was
greater
than
to
walk
erect
the
faculty
of
contrivance
was
worn
out
hopelessness
had
come
at
last
further
she
whispered
and
closed
her
eyes
from
the
stripe
of
shadow
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bridge
a
portion
of
shade
seemed
to
detach
itself
and
move
into
isolation
upon
the
pale
white
of
the
road
it
glided
noiselessly
towards
the
recumbent
woman
she
became
conscious
of
something
touching
her
hand
it
was
softness
and
it
was
warmth
she
opened
her
eyes
and
the
substance
touched
her
face
a
dog
was
licking
her
cheek
he
was
a
huge
heavy
and
quiet
creature
standing
darkly
against
the
low
horizon
and
at
least
two
feet
higher
than
the
present
position
of
her
eyes
whether
newfoundland
mastiff
bloodhound
or
what
not
it
was
impossible
to
say
he
seemed
to
be
of
too
strange
and
mysterious
a
nature
to
belong
to
any
variety
among
those
of
popular
nomenclature
being
thus
assignable
to
no
breed
he
was
the
ideal
embodiment
of
canine
generalization
from
what
was
common
to
all
night
in
its
sad
solemn
and
benevolent
aspect
apart
from
its
stealthy
and
cruel
side
was
personified
in
this
form
darkness
endows
the
small
and
ordinary
ones
among
mankind
with
poetical
power
and
even
the
suffering
woman
threw
her
idea
into
figure
in
her
reclining
position
she
looked
up
to
him
just
as
in
earlier
times
she
had
when
standing
looked
up
to
a
man
the
animal
who
was
as
homeless
as
she
respectfully
withdrew
a
step
or
two
when
the
woman
moved
and
seeing
that
she
did
not
repulse
him
he
licked
her
hand
again
a
thought
moved
within
her
like
lightning
i
can
make
use
of
might
do
it
then
she
pointed
in
the
direction
of
casterbridge
and
the
dog
seemed
to
misunderstand
he
trotted
on
then
finding
she
could
not
follow
he
came
back
and
whined
the
ultimate
and
saddest
singularity
of
effort
and
invention
was
reached
when
with
a
quickened
breathing
she
rose
to
a
stooping
posture
and
resting
her
two
little
arms
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
dog
leant
firmly
thereon
and
murmured
stimulating
words
whilst
she
sorrowed
in
her
heart
she
cheered
with
her
voice
and
what
was
stranger
than
that
the
strong
should
need
encouragement
from
the
weak
was
that
cheerfulness
should
be
so
well
stimulated
by
such
utter
dejection
her
friend
moved
forward
slowly
and
she
with
small
mincing
steps
moved
forward
beside
him
half
her
weight
being
thrown
upon
the
animal
sometimes
she
sank
as
she
had
sunk
from
walking
erect
from
the
crutches
from
the
rails
the
dog
who
now
thoroughly
understood
her
desire
and
her
incapacity
was
frantic
in
his
distress
on
these
occasions
he
would
tug
at
her
dress
and
run
forward
she
always
called
him
back
and
it
was
now
to
be
observed
that
the
woman
listened
for
human
sounds
only
to
avoid
them
it
was
evident
that
she
had
an
object
in
keeping
her
presence
on
the
road
and
her
forlorn
state
unknown
their
progress
was
necessarily
very
slow
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
town
and
the
casterbridge
lamps
lay
before
them
like
fallen
pleiads
as
they
turned
to
the
left
into
the
dense
shade
of
a
deserted
avenue
of
chestnuts
and
so
skirted
the
borough
thus
the
town
was
passed
and
the
goal
was
reached
on
this
spot
outside
the
town
rose
a
picturesque
building
originally
it
had
been
a
mere
case
to
hold
people
the
shell
had
been
so
thin
so
devoid
of
excrescence
and
so
closely
drawn
over
the
accommodation
granted
that
the
grim
character
of
what
was
beneath
showed
through
it
as
the
shape
of
a
body
is
visible
under
a
then
nature
as
if
offended
lent
a
hand
masses
of
ivy
grew
up
completely
covering
the
walls
till
the
place
looked
like
an
abbey
and
it
was
discovered
that
the
view
from
the
front
over
the
casterbridge
chimneys
was
one
of
the
most
magnificent
in
the
county
a
neighbouring
earl
once
said
that
he
would
give
up
a
rental
to
have
at
his
own
door
the
view
enjoyed
by
the
inmates
from
very
probably
the
inmates
would
have
given
up
the
view
for
his
rental
this
stone
edifice
consisted
of
a
central
mass
and
two
wings
whereon
stood
as
sentinels
a
few
slim
chimneys
now
gurgling
sorrowfully
to
the
slow
wind
in
the
wall
was
a
gate
and
by
the
gate
a
bellpull
formed
of
a
hanging
wire
the
woman
raised
herself
as
high
as
possible
upon
her
knees
and
could
just
reach
the
handle
she
moved
it
and
fell
forwards
in
a
bowed
attitude
her
face
upon
her
bosom
it
was
getting
on
towards
six
and
sounds
of
movement
were
to
be
heard
inside
the
building
which
was
the
haven
of
rest
to
this
wearied
soul
a
little
door
by
the
large
one
was
opened
and
a
man
appeared
inside
he
discerned
the
panting
heap
of
clothes
went
back
for
a
light
and
came
again
he
entered
a
second
time
and
returned
with
two
women
these
lifted
the
prostrate
figure
and
assisted
her
in
through
the
doorway
the
man
then
closed
the
door
did
she
get
here
said
one
of
the
women
lord
knows
said
the
other
is
a
dog
outside
murmured
the
overcome
traveller
is
he
gone
he
helped
stoned
him
away
said
the
man
the
little
procession
then
moved
man
in
front
bearing
the
light
the
two
bony
women
next
supporting
between
them
the
small
and
supple
one
thus
they
entered
the
house
and
disappeared
chapter
xli
is
sent
for
bathsheba
said
very
little
to
her
husband
all
that
evening
of
their
return
from
market
and
he
was
not
disposed
to
say
much
to
her
he
exhibited
the
unpleasant
combination
of
a
restless
condition
with
a
silent
tongue
the
next
day
which
was
sunday
passed
nearly
in
the
same
manner
as
regarded
their
taciturnity
bathsheba
going
to
church
both
morning
and
afternoon
this
was
the
day
before
the
budmouth
races
in
the
evening
troy
said
could
you
let
me
have
twenty
pounds
her
countenance
instantly
sank
pounds
she
said
fact
is
i
want
it
the
anxiety
upon
face
was
unusual
and
very
marked
it
was
a
culmination
of
the
mood
he
had
been
in
all
the
day
for
those
races
troy
for
the
moment
made
no
reply
her
mistake
had
its
advantages
to
a
man
who
shrank
from
having
his
mind
inspected
as
he
did
now
suppose
i
do
want
it
for
races
he
said
at
last
frank
bathsheba
replied
and
there
was
such
a
volume
of
entreaty
in
the
words
such
a
few
weeks
ago
you
said
that
i
was
far
sweeter
than
all
your
other
pleasures
put
together
and
that
you
would
give
them
all
up
for
me
and
now
you
give
up
this
one
which
is
more
a
worry
than
a
pleasure
do
frank
come
let
me
fascinate
you
by
all
i
can
pretty
words
and
pretty
looks
and
everything
i
can
think
stay
at
home
say
yes
to
your
yes
the
tenderest
and
softest
phases
of
nature
were
prominent
impulsively
for
his
acceptance
without
any
of
the
disguises
and
defences
which
the
wariness
of
her
character
when
she
was
cool
too
frequently
threw
over
them
few
men
could
have
resisted
the
arch
yet
dignified
entreaty
of
the
beautiful
face
thrown
a
little
back
and
sideways
in
the
well
known
attitude
that
expresses
more
than
the
words
it
accompanies
and
which
seems
to
have
been
designed
for
these
special
occasions
had
the
woman
not
been
his
wife
troy
would
have
succumbed
instantly
as
it
was
he
thought
he
would
not
deceive
her
longer
money
is
not
wanted
for
racing
debts
at
all
he
said
is
it
for
she
asked
worry
me
a
great
deal
by
these
mysterious
responsibilities
troy
hesitated
he
did
not
now
love
her
enough
to
allow
himself
to
be
carried
too
far
by
her
ways
yet
it
was
necessary
to
be
civil
wrong
me
by
such
a
suspicious
manner
he
said
as
you
treat
me
to
is
not
becoming
in
you
at
so
early
a
think
that
i
have
a
right
to
grumble
a
little
if
i
pay
she
said
with
features
between
a
smile
and
a
pout
and
the
former
being
done
suppose
we
proceed
to
the
latter
bathsheba
fun
is
all
very
well
but
go
too
far
or
you
may
have
cause
to
regret
she
reddened
do
that
already
she
said
quickly
do
you
regret
my
romance
has
come
to
an
romances
end
at
wish
you
talk
like
that
you
grieve
me
to
my
soul
by
being
smart
at
my
are
dull
enough
at
mine
i
believe
you
hate
your
faults
i
do
hate
be
much
more
becoming
if
you
set
yourself
to
cure
them
come
strike
a
balance
with
the
twenty
pounds
and
be
she
gave
a
sigh
of
resignation
have
about
that
sum
here
for
household
expenses
if
you
must
have
it
take
good
thank
you
i
expect
i
shall
have
gone
away
before
you
are
in
to
breakfast
must
you
go
ah
there
was
a
time
frank
when
it
would
have
taken
a
good
many
promises
to
other
people
to
drag
you
away
from
me
you
used
to
call
me
darling
then
but
it
matter
to
you
how
my
days
are
passed
must
go
in
spite
of
troy
as
he
spoke
looked
at
his
watch
and
apparently
actuated
by
principles
opened
the
case
at
the
back
revealing
snugly
stowed
within
it
a
small
coil
of
hair
eyes
had
been
accidentally
lifted
at
that
moment
and
she
saw
the
action
and
saw
the
hair
she
flushed
in
pain
and
surprise
and
some
words
escaped
her
before
she
had
thought
whether
or
not
it
was
wise
to
utter
them
curl
of
hair
she
said
frank
whose
is
that
troy
had
instantly
closed
his
watch
he
carelessly
replied
as
one
who
cloaked
some
feelings
that
the
sight
had
stirred
yours
of
course
whose
should
it
be
i
had
quite
forgotten
that
i
had
a
dreadful
fib
frank
tell
you
i
had
forgotten
it
he
said
loudly
mean
was
yellow
insulting
me
i
know
it
was
yellow
now
whose
was
it
i
want
to
tell
you
so
make
no
more
ado
it
is
the
hair
of
a
young
woman
i
was
going
to
marry
before
i
knew
ought
to
tell
me
her
name
can
not
do
she
married
yet
she
alive
she
pretty
is
wonderful
how
she
can
be
poor
thing
under
such
an
awful
affliction
affliction
he
inquired
quickly
hair
of
that
dreadful
like
that
said
troy
recovering
himself
her
hair
has
been
admired
by
everybody
who
has
seen
her
since
she
has
worn
it
loose
which
has
not
been
long
it
is
beautiful
hair
people
used
to
turn
their
heads
to
look
at
it
poor
girl
nothing
she
exclaimed
in
incipient
accents
of
pique
i
cared
for
your
love
as
much
as
i
used
to
i
could
say
people
had
turned
to
look
at
be
so
fitful
and
jealous
you
knew
what
married
life
would
be
like
and
have
entered
it
if
you
feared
these
troy
had
by
this
time
driven
her
to
bitterness
her
heart
was
big
in
her
throat
and
the
ducts
to
her
eyes
were
painfully
full
ashamed
as
she
was
to
show
emotion
at
last
she
burst
out
is
all
i
get
for
loving
you
so
well
ah
when
i
married
you
your
life
was
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
i
would
have
died
for
truly
i
can
say
that
i
would
have
died
for
you
and
now
you
sneer
at
my
foolishness
in
marrying
you
o
is
it
kind
to
me
to
throw
my
mistake
in
my
face
whatever
opinion
you
may
have
of
my
wisdom
you
should
not
tell
me
of
it
so
mercilessly
now
that
i
am
in
your
help
how
things
fall
out
said
troy
my
heart
women
will
be
the
death
of
me
you
keep
hair
burn
it
you
frank
frank
went
on
as
if
he
had
not
heard
her
are
considerations
even
before
my
consideration
for
you
reparations
to
be
you
know
nothing
of
if
you
repent
of
marrying
so
do
trembling
now
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
saying
in
mingled
tones
of
wretchedness
and
coaxing
only
repent
it
if
you
love
me
better
than
any
woman
in
the
world
i
otherwise
frank
you
repent
because
you
already
love
somebody
better
than
you
love
me
do
you
know
why
do
you
say
that
burn
that
curl
you
like
the
woman
who
owns
that
pretty
it
is
beautiful
than
my
miserable
black
mane
well
it
is
no
use
i
help
being
ugly
you
must
like
her
best
if
you
will
when
i
took
it
from
a
drawer
i
have
never
looked
upon
that
bit
of
hair
for
several
i
am
ready
to
just
now
you
said
and
woman
we
met
the
meeting
with
her
that
reminded
me
of
the
it
hers
then
there
now
that
you
have
wormed
it
out
of
me
i
hope
you
are
what
are
the
ties
that
meant
mere
mere
jest
she
said
in
mournful
astonishment
you
jest
when
i
am
so
wretchedly
in
earnest
tell
me
the
truth
frank
i
am
not
a
fool
you
know
although
i
am
a
woman
and
have
my
moments
come
treat
me
fairly
she
said
looking
honestly
and
fearlessly
into
his
face
want
much
bare
all
ah
once
i
felt
i
could
be
content
with
nothing
less
than
the
highest
homage
from
the
husband
i
should
choose
now
anything
short
of
cruelty
will
content
me
yes
the
independent
and
spirited
bathsheba
is
come
to
this
sake
be
so
desperate
troy
said
snappishly
rising
as
he
did
so
and
leaving
the
room
directly
he
had
gone
bathsheba
burst
into
great
sobs
which
cut
as
they
came
without
any
softening
by
tears
but
she
determined
to
repress
all
evidences
of
feeling
she
was
conquered
but
she
would
never
own
it
as
long
as
she
lived
her
pride
was
indeed
brought
low
by
despairing
discoveries
of
her
spoliation
by
marriage
with
a
less
pure
nature
than
her
own
she
chafed
to
and
fro
in
rebelliousness
like
a
caged
leopard
her
whole
soul
was
in
arms
and
the
blood
fired
her
face
until
she
had
met
troy
bathsheba
had
been
proud
of
her
position
as
a
woman
it
had
been
a
glory
to
her
to
know
that
her
lips
had
been
touched
by
no
on
her
waist
had
never
been
encircled
by
a
arm
she
hated
herself
now
in
those
earlier
days
she
had
always
nourished
a
secret
contempt
for
girls
who
were
the
slaves
of
the
first
young
fellow
who
should
choose
to
salute
them
she
had
never
taken
kindly
to
the
idea
of
marriage
in
the
abstract
as
did
the
majority
of
women
she
saw
about
her
in
the
turmoil
of
her
anxiety
for
her
lover
she
had
agreed
to
marry
him
but
the
perception
that
had
accompanied
her
happiest
hours
on
this
account
was
rather
that
of
than
of
promotion
and
honour
although
she
scarcely
knew
the
name
diana
was
the
goddess
whom
bathsheba
instinctively
adored
that
she
had
never
by
look
word
or
sign
encouraged
a
man
to
approach
she
had
felt
herself
sufficient
to
herself
and
had
in
the
independence
of
her
girlish
heart
fancied
there
was
a
certain
degradation
in
renouncing
the
simplicity
of
a
maiden
existence
to
become
the
humbler
half
of
an
indifferent
matrimonial
facts
now
bitterly
remembered
oh
if
she
had
never
stooped
to
folly
of
this
kind
respectable
as
it
was
and
could
only
stand
again
as
she
had
stood
on
the
hill
at
norcombe
and
dare
troy
or
any
other
man
to
pollute
a
hair
of
her
head
by
his
interference
the
next
morning
she
rose
earlier
than
usual
and
had
the
horse
saddled
for
her
ride
round
the
farm
in
the
customary
way
when
she
came
in
at
usual
hour
for
was
informed
that
her
husband
had
risen
taken
his
breakfast
and
driven
off
to
casterbridge
with
the
gig
and
poppet
after
breakfast
she
was
cool
and
herself
in
she
rambled
to
the
gate
intending
to
walk
to
another
quarter
of
the
farm
which
she
still
personally
superintended
as
well
as
her
duties
in
the
house
would
permit
continually
however
finding
herself
preceded
in
forethought
by
gabriel
oak
for
whom
she
began
to
entertain
the
genuine
friendship
of
a
sister
of
course
she
sometimes
thought
of
him
in
the
light
of
an
old
lover
and
had
momentary
imaginings
of
what
life
with
him
as
a
husband
would
have
been
like
also
of
life
with
boldwood
under
the
same
conditions
but
bathsheba
though
she
could
feel
was
not
much
given
to
futile
dreaming
and
her
musings
under
this
head
were
short
and
entirely
confined
to
the
times
when
neglect
was
more
than
ordinarily
evident
she
saw
coming
up
the
road
a
man
like
boldwood
it
was
boldwood
bathsheba
blushed
painfully
and
watched
the
farmer
stopped
when
still
a
long
way
off
and
held
up
his
hand
to
gabriel
oak
who
was
in
a
footpath
across
the
field
the
two
men
then
approached
each
other
and
seemed
to
engage
in
earnest
conversation
thus
they
continued
for
a
long
time
joseph
poorgrass
now
passed
near
them
wheeling
a
barrow
of
apples
up
the
hill
to
residence
boldwood
and
gabriel
called
to
him
spoke
to
him
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
all
three
parted
joseph
immediately
coming
up
the
hill
with
his
barrow
bathsheba
who
had
seen
this
pantomime
with
some
surprise
experienced
great
relief
when
boldwood
turned
back
again
the
message
joseph
she
said
he
set
down
his
barrow
and
putting
upon
himself
the
refined
aspect
that
a
conversation
with
a
lady
required
spoke
to
bathsheba
over
the
gate
never
see
fanny
robin
no
nor
dead
in
the
did
she
die
from
know
for
certain
but
i
should
be
inclined
to
think
it
was
from
general
neshness
of
constitution
she
was
such
a
limber
maid
that
could
stand
no
hardship
even
when
i
knowed
her
and
went
like
a
so
said
she
was
took
bad
in
the
morning
and
being
quite
feeble
and
worn
out
she
died
in
the
evening
she
belongs
by
law
to
our
parish
and
boldwood
is
going
to
send
a
waggon
at
three
this
afternoon
to
fetch
her
home
here
and
bury
i
shall
not
let
boldwood
do
any
such
shall
do
it
fanny
was
my
servant
and
although
i
only
knew
her
for
a
couple
of
days
she
belongs
to
me
how
very
very
sad
this
is
idea
of
fanny
being
in
a
bathsheba
had
begun
to
know
what
suffering
was
and
she
spoke
with
real
feeling
across
to
and
say
that
mrs
troy
will
take
upon
herself
the
duty
of
fetching
an
old
servant
of
the
family
we
ought
not
to
put
her
in
a
waggon
get
a
will
hardly
be
time
will
there
not
she
said
musingly
did
you
say
we
must
be
at
the
this
afternoon
so
to
speak
go
with
it
a
pretty
waggon
is
better
than
an
ugly
hearse
after
all
joseph
have
the
new
spring
waggon
with
the
blue
body
and
red
wheels
and
wash
it
very
clean
and
with
you
some
evergreens
and
flowers
to
put
upon
her
gather
a
great
many
and
completely
bury
her
in
them
get
some
boughs
of
laurustinus
and
variegated
box
and
yew
and
ay
and
some
bunches
of
chrysanthemum
and
let
old
pleasant
draw
her
because
she
knew
him
so
will
i
ought
to
have
said
that
the
union
in
the
form
of
four
labouring
men
will
meet
me
when
i
gets
to
our
churchyard
gate
and
take
her
and
bury
her
according
to
the
rites
of
the
board
of
guardians
as
by
law
is
fanny
come
to
this
said
bathsheba
musing
wish
i
had
known
of
it
sooner
i
thought
she
was
far
away
how
long
has
she
lived
there
been
there
a
day
or
she
has
not
been
staying
there
as
a
regular
inmate
she
first
went
to
live
in
a
side
wessex
and
since
then
been
picking
up
a
living
at
seampstering
in
melchester
for
several
months
at
the
house
of
a
very
respectable
who
takes
in
work
of
that
sort
she
only
got
handy
the
on
sunday
morning
and
supposed
here
and
there
that
she
had
traipsed
every
step
of
the
way
from
melchester
why
she
left
her
place
i
say
for
i
know
and
as
to
a
lie
why
i
tell
it
the
short
of
the
story
no
gem
ever
flashed
from
a
rosy
ray
to
a
white
one
more
rapidly
than
changed
the
young
countenance
whilst
this
word
came
from
her
in
a
breath
she
walk
along
our
she
said
in
a
suddenly
restless
and
eager
voice
believe
she
did
shall
i
call
liddy
you
well
surely
you
look
like
a
pale
and
fainty
call
her
it
is
nothing
when
did
she
pass
weatherbury
saturday
will
do
joseph
now
you
may
come
hither
a
moment
what
was
the
colour
of
fanny
hair
mistress
now
that
put
to
me
so
like
i
call
to
mind
if
believe
me
mind
go
on
and
do
what
i
told
you
no
go
she
turned
herself
away
from
him
that
he
might
no
longer
notice
the
mood
which
had
set
its
sign
so
visibly
upon
her
and
went
indoors
with
a
distressing
sense
of
faintness
and
a
beating
brow
about
an
hour
after
she
heard
the
noise
of
the
waggon
and
went
out
still
with
a
painful
consciousness
of
her
bewildered
and
troubled
look
joseph
dressed
in
his
best
suit
of
clothes
was
putting
in
the
horse
to
start
the
shrubs
and
flowers
were
all
piled
in
the
waggon
as
she
had
directed
bathsheba
hardly
saw
them
now
of
what
did
you
say
joseph
know
you
quite
sure
quite
of
what
sure
that
all
i
know
is
that
she
arrived
in
the
morning
and
died
in
the
evening
without
further
parley
what
oak
and
boldwood
told
me
was
only
these
few
words
fanny
robin
is
dead
joseph
gabriel
said
looking
in
my
face
in
his
steady
old
way
i
was
very
sorry
and
i
said
how
did
she
come
to
die
dead
in
casterbridge
union
he
said
perhaps
much
matter
about
how
she
came
to
die
she
reached
the
union
early
sunday
morning
and
died
in
the
clear
then
i
asked
what
been
doing
lately
and
boldwood
turned
round
to
me
then
and
left
off
spitting
a
thistle
with
the
end
of
his
stick
he
told
me
about
her
having
lived
by
seampstering
in
melchester
as
i
mentioned
to
you
and
that
she
walked
therefrom
at
the
end
of
last
week
passing
near
here
saturday
night
in
the
dusk
they
then
said
i
had
better
just
name
a
hint
of
her
death
to
you
and
away
they
went
her
death
might
have
been
brought
on
by
biding
in
the
night
wind
you
know
for
people
used
to
say
go
off
in
a
decline
she
used
to
cough
a
good
deal
in
winter
time
however
much
odds
to
us
about
that
now
for
all
you
heard
a
different
story
at
all
she
looked
at
him
so
intently
that
eyes
quailed
a
word
mistress
i
assure
he
said
anybody
in
the
parish
knows
the
news
wonder
why
gabriel
bring
the
message
to
me
himself
he
mostly
makes
a
point
of
seeing
me
upon
the
most
trifling
these
words
were
merely
murmured
and
she
was
looking
upon
the
ground
he
was
busy
joseph
suggested
sometimes
he
seems
to
suffer
from
things
upon
his
mind
connected
with
the
time
when
he
was
better
off
than
is
now
rather
a
curious
item
but
a
very
understanding
shepherd
and
learned
in
anything
seem
upon
his
mind
whilst
he
was
speaking
to
you
about
this
can
not
but
say
that
there
did
he
was
terrible
down
and
so
was
farmer
you
joseph
that
will
do
go
on
now
or
be
bathsheba
still
unhappy
went
indoors
again
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
she
said
to
liddy
who
had
been
informed
of
the
occurrence
was
the
colour
of
poor
fanny
hair
do
you
know
i
can
not
only
saw
her
for
a
day
or
was
light
but
she
wore
it
rather
short
and
packed
away
under
her
cap
so
that
you
would
hardly
notice
it
but
i
have
seen
her
let
it
down
when
she
was
going
to
bed
and
it
looked
beautiful
then
real
golden
young
man
was
a
soldier
was
he
not
in
the
same
regiment
as
mr
troy
he
says
he
knew
him
very
mr
troy
says
so
how
came
he
to
say
that
day
i
just
named
it
to
him
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
young
man
he
said
yes
he
knew
the
young
man
as
well
as
he
knew
himself
and
that
there
a
man
in
the
regiment
he
liked
said
that
did
he
and
he
said
there
was
a
strong
likeness
between
himself
and
the
other
young
man
so
that
sometimes
people
mistook
for
sake
stop
your
talking
said
bathsheba
with
the
nervous
petulance
that
comes
from
worrying
perceptions
chapter
xlii
joseph
and
his
head
a
wall
bounded
the
site
of
casterbridge
except
along
a
portion
of
the
end
here
a
high
gable
stood
prominent
and
it
was
covered
like
the
front
with
a
mat
of
ivy
in
this
gable
was
no
window
chimney
ornament
or
protuberance
of
any
kind
the
single
feature
appertaining
to
it
beyond
the
expanse
of
dark
green
leaves
was
a
small
door
the
situation
of
the
door
was
peculiar
the
sill
was
three
or
four
feet
above
the
ground
and
for
a
moment
one
was
at
a
loss
for
an
explanation
of
this
exceptional
altitude
till
ruts
immediately
beneath
suggested
that
the
door
was
used
solely
for
the
passage
of
articles
and
persons
to
and
from
the
level
of
a
vehicle
standing
on
the
outside
upon
the
whole
the
door
seemed
to
advertise
itself
as
a
species
of
gate
translated
to
another
sphere
that
entry
and
exit
hereby
was
only
at
rare
intervals
became
apparent
on
noting
that
tufts
of
grass
were
allowed
to
flourish
undisturbed
in
the
chinks
of
the
sill
as
the
clock
over
the
pointed
to
five
minutes
to
three
a
blue
spring
waggon
picked
out
with
red
and
containing
boughs
and
flowers
passed
the
end
of
the
street
and
up
towards
this
side
of
the
building
whilst
the
chimes
were
yet
stammering
out
a
shattered
form
of
joseph
poorgrass
rang
the
bell
and
received
directions
to
back
his
waggon
against
the
high
door
under
the
gable
the
door
then
opened
and
a
plain
elm
coffin
was
slowly
thrust
forth
and
laid
by
two
men
in
fustian
along
the
middle
of
the
vehicle
one
of
the
men
then
stepped
up
beside
it
took
from
his
pocket
a
lump
of
chalk
and
wrote
upon
the
cover
the
name
and
a
few
other
words
in
a
large
scrawling
hand
we
believe
that
they
do
these
things
more
tenderly
now
and
provide
a
plate
he
covered
the
whole
with
a
black
cloth
threadbare
but
decent
the
of
the
waggon
was
returned
to
its
place
one
of
the
men
handed
a
certificate
of
registry
to
poorgrass
and
both
entered
the
door
closing
it
behind
them
their
connection
with
her
short
as
it
had
been
was
over
for
ever
joseph
then
placed
the
flowers
as
enjoined
and
the
evergreens
around
the
flowers
till
it
was
difficult
to
divine
what
the
waggon
contained
he
smacked
his
whip
and
the
rather
pleasing
funeral
car
crept
down
the
hill
and
along
the
road
to
weatherbury
the
afternoon
drew
on
apace
and
looking
to
the
right
towards
the
sea
as
he
walked
beside
the
horse
poorgrass
saw
strange
clouds
and
scrolls
of
mist
rolling
over
the
long
ridges
which
girt
the
landscape
in
that
quarter
they
came
in
yet
greater
volumes
and
indolently
crept
across
the
intervening
valleys
and
around
the
withered
papery
flags
of
the
moor
and
river
brinks
then
their
dank
spongy
forms
closed
in
upon
the
sky
it
was
a
sudden
overgrowth
of
atmospheric
fungi
which
had
their
roots
in
the
neighbouring
sea
and
by
the
time
that
horse
man
and
corpse
entered
yalbury
great
wood
these
silent
workings
of
an
invisible
hand
had
reached
them
and
they
were
completely
enveloped
this
being
the
first
arrival
of
the
autumn
fogs
and
the
first
fog
of
the
series
the
air
was
as
an
eye
suddenly
struck
blind
the
waggon
and
its
load
rolled
no
longer
on
the
horizontal
division
between
clearness
and
opacity
but
were
imbedded
in
an
elastic
body
of
a
monotonous
pallor
throughout
there
was
no
perceptible
motion
in
the
air
not
a
visible
drop
of
water
fell
upon
a
leaf
of
the
beeches
birches
and
firs
composing
the
wood
on
either
side
the
trees
stood
in
an
attitude
of
intentness
as
if
they
waited
longingly
for
a
wind
to
come
and
rock
them
a
startling
quiet
overhung
all
surrounding
completely
that
the
crunching
of
the
was
as
a
great
noise
and
small
rustles
which
had
never
obtained
a
hearing
except
by
night
were
distinctly
individualized
joseph
poorgrass
looked
round
upon
his
sad
burden
as
it
loomed
faintly
through
the
flowering
laurustinus
then
at
the
unfathomable
gloom
amid
the
high
trees
on
each
hand
indistinct
shadowless
and
in
their
monochrome
of
grey
he
felt
anything
but
cheerful
and
wished
he
had
the
company
even
of
a
child
or
dog
stopping
the
horse
he
listened
not
a
footstep
or
wheel
was
audible
anywhere
around
and
the
dead
silence
was
broken
only
by
a
heavy
particle
falling
from
a
tree
through
the
evergreens
and
alighting
with
a
smart
rap
upon
the
coffin
of
poor
fanny
the
fog
had
by
this
time
saturated
the
trees
and
this
was
the
first
dropping
of
water
from
the
overbrimming
leaves
the
hollow
echo
of
its
fall
reminded
the
waggoner
painfully
of
the
grim
leveller
then
hard
by
came
down
another
drop
then
two
or
three
presently
there
was
a
continual
tapping
of
these
heavy
drops
upon
the
dead
leaves
the
road
and
the
travellers
the
nearer
boughs
were
beaded
with
the
mist
to
the
greyness
of
aged
men
and
the
leaves
of
the
beeches
were
hung
with
similar
drops
like
diamonds
on
auburn
hair
at
the
roadside
hamlet
called
just
beyond
this
wood
was
the
old
inn
head
it
was
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
weatherbury
and
in
the
meridian
times
of
travelling
had
been
the
place
where
many
coaches
changed
and
kept
their
relays
of
horses
all
the
old
stabling
was
now
pulled
down
and
little
remained
besides
the
habitable
inn
itself
which
standing
a
little
way
back
from
the
road
signified
its
existence
to
people
far
up
and
down
the
highway
by
a
sign
hanging
from
the
horizontal
bough
of
an
elm
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
the
variety
had
hardly
developed
into
a
distinct
species
at
this
said
in
passing
when
they
cast
their
eyes
up
to
the
tree
that
artists
were
fond
of
representing
the
signboard
hanging
thus
but
that
they
themselves
had
never
before
noticed
so
perfect
an
instance
in
actual
working
order
it
was
near
this
tree
that
the
waggon
was
standing
into
which
gabriel
oak
crept
on
his
first
journey
to
weatherbury
but
owing
to
the
darkness
the
sign
and
the
inn
had
been
unobserved
the
manners
of
the
inn
were
of
the
type
indeed
in
the
minds
of
its
frequenters
they
existed
as
unalterable
formulæ
rap
with
the
bottom
of
your
pint
for
more
liquor
for
tobacco
shout
in
calling
for
the
girl
in
waiting
say
ditto
for
the
landlady
soul
etc
it
was
a
relief
to
heart
when
the
friendly
signboard
came
in
view
and
stopping
his
horse
immediately
beneath
it
he
proceeded
to
fulfil
an
intention
made
a
long
time
before
his
spirits
were
oozing
out
of
him
quite
he
turned
the
head
to
the
green
bank
and
entered
the
hostel
for
a
mug
of
ale
going
down
into
the
kitchen
of
the
inn
the
floor
of
which
was
a
step
below
the
passage
which
in
its
turn
was
a
step
below
the
road
outside
what
should
joseph
see
to
gladden
his
eyes
but
two
discs
in
the
form
of
the
countenances
of
jan
coggan
and
mark
clark
these
owners
of
the
two
most
appreciative
throats
in
the
neighbourhood
within
the
pale
of
respectability
were
now
sitting
face
to
face
over
a
circular
table
having
an
iron
rim
to
keep
cups
and
pots
from
being
accidentally
elbowed
off
they
might
have
been
said
to
resemble
the
setting
sun
and
the
full
moon
shining
across
the
globe
neighbour
poorgrass
said
mark
clark
sure
your
face
praise
your
table
had
a
very
pale
companion
for
the
last
four
miles
said
joseph
indulging
in
a
shudder
toned
down
by
resignation
to
speak
the
truth
beginning
to
tell
upon
me
i
assure
ye
i
seed
the
colour
of
victuals
or
drink
since
breakfast
time
this
morning
and
that
was
no
more
than
a
drink
joseph
and
restrain
yourself
said
coggan
handing
him
a
hooped
mug
full
joseph
drank
for
a
moderately
long
time
then
for
a
longer
time
saying
as
he
lowered
the
jug
pretty
pretty
drinking
and
is
more
than
cheerful
on
my
melancholy
errand
so
to
speak
drink
is
a
pleasant
delight
said
jan
as
one
who
repeated
a
truism
so
familiar
to
his
brain
that
he
hardly
noticed
its
passage
over
his
tongue
and
lifting
the
cup
coggan
tilted
his
head
gradually
backwards
with
closed
eyes
that
his
expectant
soul
might
not
be
diverted
for
one
instant
from
its
bliss
by
irrelevant
surroundings
i
must
be
on
again
said
poorgrass
but
that
i
should
like
another
nip
with
ye
but
the
parish
might
lose
confidence
in
me
if
i
was
seed
be
ye
trading
to
then
joseph
to
weatherbury
got
poor
little
fanny
robin
in
my
waggon
outside
and
i
must
be
at
the
churchyard
gates
at
a
quarter
to
five
with
heard
of
it
and
so
nailed
up
in
parish
boards
after
all
and
nobody
to
pay
the
bell
shilling
and
the
grave
parish
pays
the
grave
but
not
the
bell
shilling
because
the
a
luxery
but
can
hardly
do
without
the
grave
poor
body
however
i
expect
our
mistress
will
pay
pretty
maid
as
ever
i
see
but
yer
hurry
joseph
the
pore
dead
and
you
bring
her
to
life
and
you
may
as
well
sit
down
comfortable
and
finish
another
with
mind
taking
just
the
least
thimbleful
ye
can
dream
of
more
with
ye
sonnies
but
only
a
few
minutes
because
as
course
have
another
drop
a
twice
the
man
afterwards
you
feel
so
warm
and
glorious
and
you
whop
and
slap
at
your
work
without
any
trouble
and
everything
goes
on
like
sticks
too
much
liquor
is
bad
and
leads
us
to
that
horned
man
in
the
smoky
house
but
after
all
many
people
the
gift
of
enjoying
a
wet
and
since
we
be
highly
favoured
with
a
power
that
way
we
should
make
the
most
said
mark
clark
a
talent
the
lord
has
mercifully
bestowed
upon
us
and
we
ought
not
to
neglect
it
but
what
with
the
parsons
and
clerks
and
and
serious
the
merry
old
ways
of
good
life
have
gone
to
the
my
carcase
they
have
really
i
must
be
onward
again
now
said
joseph
now
joseph
nonsense
the
poor
woman
is
dead
she
and
your
hurry
i
hope
providence
be
in
a
way
with
me
for
my
doings
said
joseph
again
sitting
down
been
troubled
with
weak
moments
lately
true
been
drinky
once
this
month
already
and
i
did
not
go
to
church
and
i
dropped
a
curse
or
two
yesterday
so
i
want
to
go
too
far
for
my
safety
your
next
world
is
your
next
world
and
not
to
be
squandered
believe
ye
to
be
a
chapelmember
joseph
that
i
no
no
i
go
so
far
as
my
part
said
coggan
staunch
church
of
and
faith
so
be
i
said
mark
clark
say
much
for
myself
i
wish
to
coggan
continued
with
that
tendency
to
talk
on
principles
which
is
characteristic
of
the
never
changed
a
single
doctrine
stuck
like
a
plaster
to
the
old
faith
i
was
born
in
yes
this
to
be
said
for
the
church
a
man
can
belong
to
the
church
and
bide
in
his
cheerful
old
inn
and
never
trouble
or
worry
his
mind
about
doctrines
at
all
but
to
be
a
meetinger
you
must
go
to
chapel
in
all
winds
and
weathers
and
make
yerself
as
frantic
as
a
skit
not
but
that
chapel
members
be
clever
chaps
enough
in
their
way
they
can
lift
up
beautiful
prayers
out
of
their
own
heads
all
about
their
families
and
shipwrecks
in
the
can
said
mark
clark
with
corroborative
feeling
we
churchmen
you
see
must
have
it
all
printed
aforehand
or
dang
it
all
we
should
no
more
know
what
to
say
to
a
great
gaffer
like
the
lord
than
babes
be
more
with
them
above
than
we
said
joseph
thoughtfully
said
coggan
know
very
well
that
if
anybody
do
go
to
heaven
they
will
worked
hard
for
it
and
they
deserve
to
have
it
such
as
i
such
a
fool
as
to
pretend
that
we
who
stick
to
the
church
have
the
same
chance
as
they
because
we
know
we
have
not
but
i
hate
a
feller
change
his
old
ancient
doctrines
for
the
sake
of
getting
to
heaven
as
soon
turn
for
the
few
pounds
you
get
why
neighbours
when
every
one
of
my
taties
were
frosted
our
parson
thirdly
were
the
man
who
gave
me
a
sack
for
seed
though
he
hardly
had
one
for
his
own
use
and
no
money
to
buy
if
it
been
for
him
i
hae
had
a
tatie
to
put
in
my
garden
think
turn
after
that
no
stick
to
my
side
and
if
we
be
in
the
wrong
so
be
it
fall
with
the
fallen
well
said
observed
folks
i
must
be
moving
now
upon
my
life
i
must
thirdly
will
be
waiting
at
the
church
gates
and
the
woman
outside
in
the
poorgrass
be
so
miserable
thirdly
mind
a
generous
man
found
me
in
tracts
for
years
and
consumed
a
good
many
in
the
course
of
a
long
and
shady
life
but
never
been
the
man
to
cry
out
at
the
expense
sit
the
longer
joseph
poorgrass
remained
the
less
his
spirit
was
troubled
by
the
duties
which
devolved
upon
him
this
afternoon
the
minutes
glided
by
uncounted
until
the
evening
shades
began
perceptibly
to
deepen
and
the
eyes
of
the
three
were
but
sparkling
points
on
the
surface
of
darkness
repeater
struck
six
from
his
pocket
in
the
usual
still
small
tones
at
that
moment
hasty
steps
were
heard
in
the
entry
and
the
door
opened
to
admit
the
figure
of
gabriel
oak
followed
by
the
maid
of
the
inn
bearing
a
candle
he
stared
sternly
at
the
one
lengthy
and
two
round
faces
of
the
sitters
which
confronted
him
with
the
expressions
of
a
fiddle
and
a
couple
of
joseph
poorgrass
blinked
and
shrank
several
inches
into
the
background
my
soul
ashamed
of
you
disgraceful
joseph
disgraceful
said
gabriel
indignantly
you
call
yourself
a
man
and
know
better
than
coggan
looked
up
indefinitely
at
oak
one
or
other
of
his
eyes
occasionally
opening
and
closing
of
its
own
accord
as
if
it
were
not
a
member
but
a
dozy
individual
with
a
distinct
personality
take
on
so
shepherd
said
mark
clark
looking
reproachfully
at
the
candle
which
appeared
to
possess
special
features
of
interest
for
his
eyes
can
hurt
a
dead
woman
at
length
said
coggan
with
the
precision
of
a
machine
that
could
be
done
for
her
is
beyond
us
and
why
should
a
man
put
himself
in
a
tearing
hurry
for
lifeless
clay
that
can
neither
feel
nor
see
and
know
what
you
do
with
her
at
all
if
been
alive
i
would
have
been
the
first
to
help
her
if
she
now
wanted
victuals
and
drink
pay
for
it
money
down
but
dead
and
no
speed
of
ours
will
bring
her
to
life
the
past
spent
upon
her
is
throwed
away
why
should
we
hurry
to
do
not
required
drink
shepherd
and
be
friends
for
we
may
be
like
may
added
mark
clark
emphatically
at
once
drinking
himself
to
run
no
further
risk
of
losing
his
chance
by
the
event
alluded
to
jan
meanwhile
merging
his
additional
thoughts
of
in
a
song
and
while
peace
and
i
find
at
my
board
with
a
heart
free
from
and
with
my
friends
will
i
share
what
may
and
let
them
spread
the
hold
thy
horning
jan
said
oak
and
turning
upon
poorgrass
for
you
joseph
who
do
your
wicked
deeds
in
such
confoundedly
holy
ways
you
are
as
drunk
as
you
can
shepherd
oak
no
listen
to
reason
shepherd
all
the
matter
with
me
is
the
affliction
called
a
multiplying
eye
and
how
it
is
i
look
double
to
mean
you
look
double
to
multiplying
eye
is
a
very
bad
thing
said
mark
clark
always
comes
on
when
i
have
been
in
a
a
little
time
said
joseph
poorgrass
meekly
i
see
two
of
every
sort
as
if
i
were
some
holy
man
living
in
the
times
of
king
noah
and
entering
into
the
ark
he
added
becoming
much
affected
by
the
picture
of
himself
as
a
person
thrown
away
and
shedding
tears
feel
too
good
for
england
i
ought
to
have
lived
in
genesis
by
rights
like
the
other
men
of
sacrifice
and
then
i
have
called
a
in
such
a
way
wish
show
yourself
a
man
of
spirit
and
not
sit
whining
there
myself
a
man
of
spirit
ah
well
let
me
take
the
name
of
drunkard
me
be
a
man
of
contrite
it
be
i
know
that
i
always
do
say
afore
i
do
anything
from
my
getting
up
to
my
going
down
of
the
same
and
i
be
willing
to
take
as
much
disgrace
as
there
is
in
that
holy
act
hah
yes
but
not
a
man
of
spirit
have
i
ever
allowed
the
toe
of
pride
to
be
lifted
against
my
hinder
parts
without
groaning
manfully
that
i
question
the
right
to
do
so
i
inquire
that
query
boldly
say
that
you
have
hero
poorgrass
admitted
have
i
allowed
such
treatment
to
pass
unquestioned
yet
the
shepherd
says
in
the
face
of
that
rich
testimony
that
i
be
not
a
man
of
spirit
well
let
it
pass
by
and
death
is
a
kind
friend
gabriel
seeing
that
neither
of
the
three
was
in
a
fit
state
to
take
charge
of
the
waggon
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
made
no
reply
but
closing
the
door
again
upon
them
went
across
to
where
the
vehicle
stood
now
getting
indistinct
in
the
fog
and
gloom
of
this
mildewy
time
he
pulled
the
head
from
the
large
patch
of
turf
it
had
eaten
bare
readjusted
the
boughs
over
the
coffin
and
drove
along
through
the
unwholesome
night
it
had
gradually
become
rumoured
in
the
village
that
the
body
to
be
brought
and
buried
that
day
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
unfortunate
fanny
robin
who
had
followed
the
eleventh
from
casterbridge
through
melchester
and
onwards
but
thanks
to
reticence
and
generosity
the
lover
she
had
followed
had
never
been
individualized
as
troy
gabriel
hoped
that
the
whole
truth
of
the
matter
might
not
be
published
till
at
any
rate
the
girl
had
been
in
her
grave
for
a
few
days
when
the
interposing
barriers
of
earth
and
time
and
a
sense
that
the
events
had
been
somewhat
shut
into
oblivion
would
deaden
the
sting
that
revelation
and
invidious
remark
would
have
for
bathsheba
just
now
by
the
time
that
gabriel
reached
the
old
her
residence
which
lay
in
his
way
to
the
church
it
was
quite
dark
a
man
came
from
the
gate
and
said
through
the
fog
which
hung
between
them
like
blown
that
poorgrass
with
the
corpse
gabriel
recognized
the
voice
as
that
of
the
parson
corpse
is
here
sir
said
gabriel
have
just
been
to
inquire
of
mrs
troy
if
she
could
tell
me
the
reason
of
the
delay
i
am
afraid
it
is
too
late
now
for
the
funeral
to
be
performed
with
proper
decency
have
you
the
certificate
said
gabriel
expect
poorgrass
has
that
and
at
the
head
i
forgot
to
ask
him
for
that
settles
the
matter
put
off
the
funeral
till
morning
the
body
may
be
brought
on
to
the
church
or
it
may
be
left
here
at
the
farm
and
fetched
by
the
bearers
in
the
morning
they
waited
more
than
an
hour
and
have
now
gone
gabriel
had
his
reasons
for
thinking
the
latter
a
most
objectionable
plan
notwithstanding
that
fanny
had
been
an
inmate
of
the
for
several
years
in
the
lifetime
of
uncle
visions
of
several
unhappy
contingencies
which
might
arise
from
this
delay
flitted
before
him
but
his
will
was
not
law
and
he
went
indoors
to
inquire
of
his
mistress
what
were
her
wishes
on
the
subject
he
found
her
in
an
unusual
mood
her
eyes
as
she
looked
up
to
him
were
suspicious
and
perplexed
as
with
some
antecedent
thought
troy
had
not
yet
returned
at
first
bathsheba
assented
with
a
mien
of
indifference
to
his
proposition
that
they
should
go
on
to
the
church
at
once
with
their
burden
but
immediately
afterwards
following
gabriel
to
the
gate
she
swerved
to
the
extreme
of
solicitousness
on
account
and
desired
that
the
girl
might
be
brought
into
the
house
oak
argued
upon
the
convenience
of
leaving
her
in
the
waggon
just
as
she
lay
now
with
her
flowers
and
green
leaves
about
her
merely
wheeling
the
vehicle
into
the
till
the
morning
but
to
no
purpose
is
unkind
and
unchristian
she
said
leave
the
poor
thing
in
a
all
well
then
said
the
parson
i
will
arrange
that
the
funeral
shall
take
place
early
perhaps
mrs
troy
is
right
in
feeling
that
we
can
not
treat
a
dead
too
thoughtfully
we
must
remember
that
though
she
may
have
erred
grievously
in
leaving
her
home
she
is
still
our
sister
and
it
is
to
be
believed
that
uncovenanted
mercies
are
extended
towards
her
and
that
she
is
a
member
of
the
flock
of
the
words
spread
into
the
heavy
air
with
a
sad
yet
unperturbed
cadence
and
gabriel
shed
an
honest
tear
bathsheba
seemed
unmoved
thirdly
then
left
them
and
gabriel
lighted
a
lantern
fetching
three
other
men
to
assist
him
they
bore
the
unconscious
truant
indoors
placing
the
coffin
on
two
benches
in
the
middle
of
a
little
next
the
hall
as
bathsheba
directed
every
one
except
gabriel
oak
then
left
the
room
he
still
indecisively
lingered
beside
the
body
he
was
deeply
troubled
at
the
wretchedly
ironical
aspect
that
circumstances
were
putting
on
with
regard
to
wife
and
at
his
own
powerlessness
to
counteract
them
in
spite
of
his
careful
manœuvering
all
this
day
the
very
worst
event
that
could
in
any
way
have
happened
in
connection
with
the
burial
had
happened
now
oak
imagined
a
terrible
discovery
resulting
from
this
work
that
might
cast
over
life
a
shade
which
the
interposition
of
many
lapsing
years
might
but
indifferently
lighten
and
which
nothing
at
all
might
altogether
remove
suddenly
as
in
a
last
attempt
to
save
bathsheba
from
at
any
rate
immediate
anguish
he
looked
again
as
he
had
looked
before
at
the
chalk
writing
upon
the
the
scrawl
was
this
simple
one
robin
and
gabriel
took
his
handkerchief
and
carefully
rubbed
out
the
two
latter
words
leaving
visible
the
inscription
only
he
then
left
the
room
and
went
out
quietly
by
the
front
door

inquired
liddy
at
a
later
hour
the
same
evening
standing
by
the
door
with
a
chamber
candlestick
in
her
hand
and
addressing
bathsheba
who
sat
cheerless
and
alone
in
the
large

beside
the

for

if
you
like
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
fanny
if
i
may
sit
in
my
own
room
and
have
a
candle
she
was
such
a
childlike
nesh
young
thing
that
her

appear
to
anybody
if
it
tried
quite
no
no
you
go
to

sit
up
for
him

and
if
he
has
not
arrived
by
that
time
i
shall
give
him
up
and
go
to

is
it
you
sit
upstairs
i
said
bathsheba
desultorily
worth
a
fire
here
she
suddenly
exclaimed
in
an
impulsive
and
excited
whisper
you
heard
anything
strange
said
of
fanny
the
words
had
no
sooner
escaped
her
than
an
expression
of
unutterable
regret
crossed
her
face
and
she
burst
into
tears
a
word
said
liddy
looking
at
the
weeping
woman
with
astonishment
is
it
makes
you
cry
so
has
anything
hurt
you
she
came
to
side
with
a
face
full
of
sympathy
want
you
any
more
i
can
hardly
say
why
i
have
taken
to
crying
lately
i
never
used
to
cry
liddy
then
left
the
parlour
and
closed
the
door
bathsheba
was
lonely
and
miserable
now
not
lonelier
actually
than
she
had
been
before
her
marriage
but
her
loneliness
then
was
to
that
of
the
present
time
as
the
solitude
of
a
mountain
is
to
the
solitude
of
a
cave
and
within
the
last
day
or
two
had
come
these
disquieting
thoughts
about
her
past
her
wayward
sentiment
that
evening
concerning
temporary
had
been
the
result
of
a
strange
complication
of
impulses
in
bosom
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurately
described
as
a
determined
rebellion
against
her
prejudices
a
revulsion
from
a
lower
instinct
of
uncharitableness
which
would
have
withheld
all
sympathy
from
the
dead
woman
because
in
life
she
had
preceded
bathsheba
in
the
attentions
of
a
man
whom
bathsheba
had
by
no
means
ceased
from
loving
though
her
love
was
sick
to
death
just
now
with
the
gravity
of
a
further
misgiving
in
five
or
ten
minutes
there
was
another
tap
at
the
door
liddy
reappeared
and
coming
in
a
little
way
stood
hesitating
until
at
length
she
said
has
just
heard
something
very
strange
but
i
know
it
true
and
we
shall
be
sure
to
know
the
rights
of
it
in
a
day
or
is
it
nothing
connected
with
you
or
us
it
is
about
fanny
that
same
thing
you
have
have
heard
mean
that
a
wicked
story
is
got
to
weatherbury
within
this
last
liddy
came
close
to
her
mistress
and
whispered
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
slowly
into
her
ear
inclining
her
head
as
she
spoke
in
the
direction
of
the
room
where
fanny
lay
bathsheba
trembled
from
head
to
foot
believe
it
she
said
excitedly
only
one
name
written
on
the
i
and
a
good
many
others
for
we
should
surely
have
been
told
more
about
it
if
it
had
been
you
think
so
might
or
we
might
bathsheba
turned
and
looked
into
the
fire
that
liddy
might
not
see
her
face
finding
that
her
mistress
was
going
to
say
no
more
liddy
glided
out
closed
the
door
softly
and
went
to
bed
face
as
she
continued
looking
into
the
fire
that
evening
might
have
excited
solicitousness
on
her
account
even
among
those
who
loved
her
least
the
sadness
of
fanny
fate
did
not
make
glorious
although
she
was
the
esther
to
this
poor
vashti
and
their
fates
might
be
supposed
to
stand
in
some
respects
as
contrasts
to
each
other
when
liddy
came
into
the
room
a
second
time
the
beautiful
eyes
which
met
hers
had
worn
a
listless
weary
look
when
she
went
out
after
telling
the
story
they
had
expressed
wretchedness
in
full
activity
her
simple
country
nature
fed
on
principles
was
troubled
by
that
which
would
have
troubled
a
woman
of
the
world
very
little
both
fanny
and
her
child
if
she
had
one
being
dead
bathsheba
had
grounds
for
conjecturing
a
connection
between
her
own
history
and
the
dimly
suspected
tragedy
of
end
which
oak
and
boldwood
never
for
a
moment
credited
her
with
possessing
the
meeting
with
the
lonely
woman
on
the
previous
saturday
night
had
been
unwitnessed
and
unspoken
of
oak
may
have
had
the
best
of
intentions
in
withholding
for
as
many
days
as
possible
the
details
of
what
had
happened
to
fanny
but
had
he
known
that
perceptions
had
already
been
exercised
in
the
matter
he
would
have
done
nothing
to
lengthen
the
minutes
of
suspense
she
was
now
undergoing
when
the
certainty
which
must
terminate
it
would
be
the
worst
fact
suspected
after
all
she
suddenly
felt
a
longing
desire
to
speak
to
some
one
stronger
than
herself
and
so
get
strength
to
sustain
her
surmised
position
with
dignity
and
her
lurking
doubts
with
stoicism
where
could
she
find
such
a
friend
nowhere
in
the
house
she
was
by
far
the
coolest
of
the
women
under
her
roof
patience
and
suspension
of
judgement
for
a
few
hours
were
what
she
wanted
to
learn
and
there
was
nobody
to
teach
her
might
she
but
go
to
gabriel
oak
that
could
not
be
what
a
way
oak
had
she
thought
of
enduring
things
boldwood
who
seemed
so
much
deeper
and
higher
and
stronger
in
feeling
than
gabriel
had
not
yet
learnt
any
more
than
she
herself
the
simple
lesson
which
oak
showed
a
mastery
of
by
every
turn
and
look
he
among
the
multitude
of
interests
by
which
he
was
surrounded
those
which
affected
his
personal
were
not
the
most
absorbing
and
important
in
his
eyes
oak
meditatively
looked
upon
the
horizon
of
circumstances
without
any
special
regard
to
his
own
standpoint
in
the
midst
that
was
how
she
would
wish
to
be
but
then
oak
was
not
racked
by
incertitude
upon
the
inmost
matter
of
his
bosom
as
she
was
at
this
moment
oak
knew
all
about
fanny
that
he
wished
to
felt
convinced
of
that
if
she
were
to
go
to
him
now
at
once
and
say
no
more
than
these
few
words
is
the
truth
of
the
story
he
would
feel
bound
in
honour
to
tell
her
it
would
be
an
inexpressible
relief
no
further
speech
would
need
to
be
uttered
he
knew
her
so
well
that
no
eccentricity
of
behaviour
in
her
would
alarm
him
she
flung
a
cloak
round
her
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
every
blade
every
twig
was
still
the
air
was
yet
thick
with
moisture
though
somewhat
less
dense
than
during
the
afternoon
and
a
steady
smack
of
drops
upon
the
fallen
leaves
under
the
boughs
was
almost
musical
in
its
soothing
regularity
it
seemed
better
to
be
out
of
the
house
than
within
it
and
bathsheba
closed
the
door
and
walked
slowly
down
the
lane
till
she
came
opposite
to
cottage
where
he
now
lived
alone
having
left
house
through
being
pinched
for
room
there
was
a
light
in
one
window
only
and
that
was
downstairs
the
shutters
were
not
closed
nor
was
any
blind
or
curtain
drawn
over
the
window
neither
robbery
nor
observation
being
a
contingency
which
could
do
much
injury
to
the
occupant
of
the
domicile
yes
it
was
gabriel
himself
who
was
sitting
up
he
was
reading
from
her
in
the
road
she
could
see
him
plainly
sitting
quite
still
his
light
curly
head
upon
his
hand
and
only
occasionally
looking
up
to
snuff
the
candle
which
stood
beside
him
at
length
he
looked
at
the
clock
seemed
surprised
at
the
lateness
of
the
hour
closed
his
book
and
arose
he
was
going
to
bed
she
knew
and
if
she
tapped
it
must
be
done
at
once
alas
for
her
resolve
she
felt
she
could
not
do
it
not
for
worlds
now
could
she
give
a
hint
about
her
misery
to
him
much
less
ask
him
plainly
for
information
on
the
cause
of
death
she
must
suspect
and
guess
and
chafe
and
bear
it
all
alone
like
a
homeless
wanderer
she
lingered
by
the
bank
as
if
lulled
and
fascinated
by
the
atmosphere
of
content
which
seemed
to
spread
from
that
little
dwelling
and
was
so
sadly
lacking
in
her
own
gabriel
appeared
in
an
upper
room
placed
his
light
in
the
and
down
to
pray
the
contrast
of
the
picture
with
her
rebellious
and
agitated
existence
at
this
same
time
was
too
much
for
her
to
bear
to
look
upon
longer
it
was
not
for
her
to
make
a
truce
with
trouble
by
any
such
means
she
must
tread
her
giddy
distracting
measure
to
its
last
note
as
she
had
begun
it
with
a
swollen
heart
she
went
again
up
the
lane
and
entered
her
own
door
more
fevered
now
by
a
reaction
from
the
first
feelings
which
example
had
raised
in
her
she
paused
in
the
hall
looking
at
the
door
of
the
room
wherein
fanny
lay
she
locked
her
fingers
threw
back
her
head
and
strained
her
hot
hands
rigidly
across
her
forehead
saying
with
a
hysterical
sob
to
god
you
would
speak
and
tell
me
your
secret
fanny
oh
i
hope
hope
it
is
not
true
that
there
are
two
of
you
if
i
could
only
look
in
upon
you
for
one
little
minute
i
should
know
all
a
few
moments
passed
and
she
added
slowly
i
bathsheba
in
after
times
could
never
gauge
the
mood
which
carried
her
through
the
actions
following
this
murmured
resolution
on
this
memorable
evening
of
her
life
she
went
to
the
for
a
at
the
end
of
a
short
though
undefined
time
she
found
herself
in
the
small
room
quivering
with
emotion
a
mist
before
her
eyes
and
an
excruciating
pulsation
in
her
brain
standing
beside
the
uncovered
coffin
of
the
girl
whose
conjectured
end
had
so
entirely
engrossed
her
and
saying
to
herself
in
a
husky
voice
as
she
gazed
was
best
to
know
the
worst
and
i
know
it
now
she
was
conscious
of
having
brought
about
this
situation
by
a
series
of
actions
done
as
by
one
in
an
extravagant
dream
of
following
that
idea
as
to
method
which
had
burst
upon
her
in
the
hall
with
glaring
obviousness
by
gliding
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
assuring
herself
by
listening
to
the
heavy
breathing
of
her
maids
that
they
were
asleep
gliding
down
again
turning
the
handle
of
the
door
within
which
the
young
girl
lay
and
deliberately
setting
herself
to
do
what
if
she
had
anticipated
any
such
undertaking
at
night
and
alone
would
have
horrified
her
but
which
when
done
was
not
so
dreadful
as
was
the
conclusive
proof
of
her
conduct
which
came
with
knowing
beyond
doubt
the
last
chapter
of
story
head
sank
upon
her
bosom
and
the
breath
which
had
been
bated
in
suspense
curiosity
and
interest
was
exhaled
now
in
the
form
of
a
whispered
wail
she
said
and
the
silent
room
added
length
to
her
moan
her
tears
fell
fast
beside
the
unconscious
pair
in
the
coffin
tears
of
a
complicated
origin
of
a
nature
indescribable
almost
indefinable
except
as
other
than
those
of
simple
sorrow
assuredly
their
wonted
fires
must
have
lived
in
ashes
when
events
were
so
shaped
as
to
chariot
her
hither
in
this
natural
unobtrusive
yet
effectual
manner
the
one
feat
of
which
a
mean
condition
could
be
resolved
into
a
grand
one
fanny
had
achieved
and
to
that
had
destiny
subjoined
this
reencounter
which
had
in
wild
imagining
turned
her
failure
to
success
her
humiliation
to
triumph
her
lucklessness
to
ascendency
it
had
thrown
over
herself
a
garish
light
of
mockery
and
set
upon
all
things
about
her
an
ironical
smile
face
was
framed
in
by
that
yellow
hair
of
hers
and
there
was
no
longer
much
room
for
doubt
as
to
the
origin
of
the
curl
owned
by
troy
in
heated
fancy
the
innocent
white
countenance
expressed
a
dim
triumphant
consciousness
of
the
pain
she
was
retaliating
for
her
pain
with
all
the
merciless
rigour
of
the
mosaic
law
for
burning
wound
for
wound
strife
for
bathsheba
indulged
in
contemplations
of
escape
from
her
position
by
immediate
death
which
thought
she
though
it
was
an
inconvenient
and
awful
way
had
limits
to
its
inconvenience
and
awfulness
that
could
not
be
overpassed
whilst
the
shames
of
life
were
measureless
yet
even
this
scheme
of
extinction
by
death
was
but
tamely
copying
her
method
without
the
reasons
which
had
glorified
it
in
her
case
she
glided
rapidly
up
and
down
the
room
as
was
mostly
her
habit
when
excited
her
hands
hanging
clasped
in
front
of
her
as
she
thought
and
in
part
expressed
in
broken
words
i
hate
her
yet
i
mean
that
i
hate
her
for
it
is
grievous
and
wicked
and
yet
i
hate
her
a
little
yes
my
flesh
insists
upon
hating
her
whether
my
spirit
is
willing
or
no
if
she
had
only
lived
i
could
have
been
angry
and
cruel
towards
her
with
some
justification
but
to
be
vindictive
towards
a
poor
dead
woman
recoils
upon
myself
o
god
have
mercy
i
am
miserable
at
all
this
bathsheba
became
at
this
moment
so
terrified
at
her
own
state
of
mind
that
she
looked
around
for
some
sort
of
refuge
from
herself
the
vision
of
oak
kneeling
down
that
night
recurred
to
her
and
with
the
imitative
instinct
which
animates
women
she
seized
upon
the
idea
resolved
to
kneel
and
if
possible
pray
gabriel
had
prayed
so
would
she
she
knelt
beside
the
coffin
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
for
a
time
the
room
was
silent
as
a
tomb
whether
from
a
purely
mechanical
or
from
any
other
cause
when
bathsheba
arose
it
was
with
a
quieted
spirit
and
a
regret
for
the
antagonistic
instincts
which
had
seized
upon
her
just
before
in
her
desire
to
make
atonement
she
took
flowers
from
a
vase
by
the
window
and
began
laying
them
around
the
dead
head
bathsheba
knew
no
other
way
of
showing
kindness
to
persons
departed
than
by
giving
them
flowers
she
knew
not
how
long
she
remained
engaged
thus
she
forgot
time
life
where
she
was
what
she
was
doing
a
slamming
together
of
the
doors
in
the
yard
brought
her
to
herself
again
an
instant
after
the
front
door
opened
and
closed
steps
crossed
the
hall
and
her
husband
appeared
at
the
entrance
to
the
room
looking
in
upon
her
he
beheld
it
all
by
degrees
stared
in
stupefaction
at
the
scene
as
if
he
thought
it
an
illusion
raised
by
some
fiendish
incantation
bathsheba
pallid
as
a
corpse
on
end
gazed
back
at
him
in
the
same
wild
way
so
little
are
instinctive
guesses
the
fruit
of
a
legitimate
induction
that
at
this
moment
as
he
stood
with
the
door
in
his
hand
troy
never
once
thought
of
fanny
in
connection
with
what
he
saw
his
first
confused
idea
was
that
somebody
in
the
house
had
died
said
troy
blankly
must
go
i
must
go
said
bathsheba
to
herself
more
than
to
him
she
came
with
a
dilated
eye
towards
the
door
to
push
past
him
the
matter
in
name
dead
said
troy
can
not
say
let
me
go
out
i
want
air
she
continued
no
stay
i
insist
he
seized
her
hand
and
then
volition
seemed
to
leave
her
and
she
went
off
into
a
state
of
passivity
he
still
holding
her
came
up
the
room
and
thus
hand
in
hand
troy
and
bathsheba
approached
the
side
the
candle
was
standing
on
a
bureau
close
by
them
and
the
light
slanted
down
distinctly
enkindling
the
cold
features
of
both
mother
and
babe
troy
looked
in
dropped
his
hand
knowledge
of
it
all
came
over
him
in
a
lurid
sheen
and
he
stood
still
so
still
he
remained
that
he
could
be
imagined
to
have
left
in
him
no
motive
power
whatever
the
clashes
of
feeling
in
all
directions
confounded
one
another
produced
a
neutrality
and
there
was
motion
in
none
you
know
her
said
bathsheba
in
a
small
enclosed
echo
as
from
the
interior
of
a
cell
do
said
troy
it
she
he
had
originally
stood
perfectly
erect
and
now
in
the
congealed
immobility
of
his
frame
could
be
discerned
an
incipient
movement
as
in
the
darkest
night
may
be
discerned
light
after
a
while
he
was
gradually
sinking
forwards
the
lines
of
his
features
softened
and
dismay
modulated
to
illimitable
sadness
bathsheba
was
regarding
him
from
the
other
side
still
with
parted
lips
and
distracted
eyes
capacity
for
intense
feeling
is
proportionate
to
the
general
intensity
of
the
nature
and
perhaps
in
all
sufferings
much
greater
relatively
to
her
strength
there
never
was
a
time
she
suffered
in
an
absolute
sense
what
bathsheba
suffered
now
what
troy
did
was
to
sink
upon
his
knees
with
an
indefinable
union
of
remorse
and
reverence
upon
his
face
and
bending
over
fanny
robin
gently
kissed
her
as
one
would
kiss
an
infant
asleep
to
avoid
awakening
it
at
the
sight
and
sound
of
that
to
her
unendurable
act
bathsheba
sprang
towards
him
all
the
strong
feelings
which
had
been
scattered
over
her
existence
since
she
knew
what
feeling
was
seemed
gathered
together
into
one
pulsation
now
the
revulsion
from
her
indignant
mood
a
little
earlier
when
she
had
meditated
upon
compromised
honour
forestalment
eclipse
in
maternity
by
another
was
violent
and
entire
all
that
was
forgotten
in
the
simple
and
still
strong
attachment
of
wife
to
husband
she
had
sighed
for
her
then
and
now
she
cried
aloud
against
the
severance
of
the
union
she
had
deplored
she
flung
her
arms
round
neck
exclaiming
wildly
from
the
deepest
deep
of
her
kiss
them
o
frank
i
bear
i
love
you
better
than
she
did
kiss
me
too
me
will
frank
kiss
me
too
there
was
something
so
abnormal
and
startling
in
the
childlike
pain
and
simplicity
of
this
appeal
from
a
woman
of
calibre
and
independence
that
troy
loosening
her
tightly
clasped
arms
from
his
neck
looked
at
her
in
bewilderment
it
was
such
an
unexpected
revelation
of
all
women
being
alike
at
heart
even
those
so
different
in
their
accessories
as
fanny
and
this
one
beside
him
that
troy
could
hardly
seem
to
believe
her
to
be
his
proud
wife
bathsheba
own
spirit
seemed
to
be
animating
her
frame
but
this
was
the
mood
of
a
few
instants
only
when
the
momentary
surprise
had
passed
his
expression
changed
to
a
silencing
imperious
gaze
will
not
kiss
you
he
said
pushing
her
away
had
the
wife
now
but
gone
no
further
yet
perhaps
under
the
harrowing
circumstances
to
speak
out
was
the
one
wrong
act
which
can
be
better
understood
if
not
forgiven
in
her
than
the
right
and
politic
one
her
rival
being
now
but
a
corpse
all
the
feeling
she
had
been
betrayed
into
showing
she
drew
back
to
herself
again
by
a
strenuous
effort
of
have
you
to
say
as
your
reason
she
asked
her
bitter
voice
being
strangely
that
of
another
woman
now
have
to
say
that
i
have
been
a
bad
man
he
answered
that
this
woman
is
your
victim
and
i
not
less
than
taunt
me
madam
this
woman
is
more
to
me
dead
as
she
is
than
ever
you
were
or
are
or
can
be
if
satan
had
not
tempted
me
with
that
face
of
yours
and
those
cursed
coquetries
i
should
have
married
her
i
never
had
another
thought
till
you
came
in
my
way
would
to
god
that
i
had
but
it
is
all
too
late
he
turned
to
fanny
then
never
mind
darling
he
said
the
sight
of
heaven
you
are
my
very
very
wife
at
these
words
there
arose
from
lips
a
long
low
cry
of
measureless
despair
and
indignation
such
a
wail
of
anguish
as
had
never
before
been
heard
within
those
walls
it
was
the
τετέλεσται
of
her
union
with
troy
i
she
added
as
a
continuation
of
the
same
cry
and
sobbing
pitifully
and
the
rarity
with
her
of
such
abandonment
only
made
the
condition
more
dire
are
nothing
to
said
troy
heartlessly
ceremony
before
a
priest
make
a
marriage
i
am
not
morally
a
vehement
impulse
to
flee
from
him
to
run
from
this
place
hide
and
escape
his
words
at
any
price
not
stopping
short
of
death
itself
mastered
bathsheba
now
she
waited
not
an
instant
but
turned
to
the
door
and
ran
out
chapter
xliv
under
a
bathsheba
went
along
the
dark
road
neither
knowing
nor
caring
about
the
direction
or
issue
of
her
flight
the
first
time
that
she
definitely
noticed
her
position
was
when
she
reached
a
gate
leading
into
a
thicket
overhung
by
some
large
oak
and
beech
trees
on
looking
into
the
place
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
seen
it
by
daylight
on
some
previous
occasion
and
that
what
appeared
like
an
impassable
thicket
was
in
reality
a
brake
of
fern
now
withering
fast
she
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
do
with
her
palpitating
self
than
to
go
in
here
and
hide
and
entering
she
lighted
on
a
spot
sheltered
from
the
damp
fog
by
a
reclining
trunk
where
she
sank
down
upon
a
tangled
couch
of
fronds
and
stems
she
mechanically
pulled
some
armfuls
round
her
to
keep
off
the
breezes
and
closed
her
eyes
whether
she
slept
or
not
that
night
bathsheba
was
not
clearly
aware
but
it
was
with
a
freshened
existence
and
a
cooler
brain
that
a
long
time
afterwards
she
became
conscious
of
some
interesting
proceedings
which
were
going
on
in
the
trees
above
her
head
and
around
a
chatter
was
the
first
sound
it
was
a
sparrow
just
waking
next
from
another
retreat
it
was
a
finch
third
from
the
hedge
it
was
a
robin
overhead
a
squirrel
then
from
the
road
my
and
my
it
was
a
ploughboy
presently
he
came
opposite
and
she
believed
from
his
voice
that
he
was
one
of
the
boys
on
her
own
farm
he
was
followed
by
a
shambling
tramp
of
heavy
feet
and
looking
through
the
ferns
bathsheba
could
just
discern
in
the
wan
light
of
daybreak
a
team
of
her
own
horses
they
stopped
to
drink
at
a
pond
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
she
watched
them
flouncing
into
the
pool
drinking
tossing
up
their
heads
drinking
again
the
water
dribbling
from
their
lips
in
silver
threads
there
was
another
flounce
and
they
came
out
of
the
pond
and
turned
back
again
towards
the
farm
she
looked
further
around
day
was
just
dawning
and
beside
its
cool
air
and
colours
her
heated
actions
and
resolves
of
the
night
stood
out
in
lurid
contrast
she
perceived
that
in
her
lap
and
clinging
to
her
hair
were
red
and
yellow
leaves
which
had
come
down
from
the
tree
and
settled
silently
upon
her
during
her
partial
sleep
bathsheba
shook
her
dress
to
get
rid
of
them
when
multitudes
of
the
same
family
lying
round
about
her
rose
and
fluttered
away
in
the
breeze
thus
created
ghosts
from
an
enchanter
there
was
an
opening
towards
the
east
and
the
glow
from
the
as
yet
unrisen
sun
attracted
her
eyes
thither
from
her
feet
and
between
the
beautiful
yellowing
ferns
with
their
feathery
arms
the
ground
sloped
downwards
to
a
hollow
in
which
was
a
species
of
swamp
dotted
with
fungi
a
morning
mist
hung
over
it
fulsome
yet
magnificent
silvery
veil
full
of
light
from
the
sun
yet
hedge
behind
it
being
in
some
measure
hidden
by
its
hazy
luminousness
up
the
sides
of
this
depression
grew
sheaves
of
the
common
rush
and
here
and
there
a
peculiar
species
of
flag
the
blades
of
which
glistened
in
the
emerging
sun
like
scythes
but
the
general
aspect
of
the
swamp
was
malignant
from
its
moist
and
poisonous
coat
seemed
to
be
exhaled
the
essences
of
evil
things
in
the
earth
and
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
the
fungi
grew
in
all
manner
of
positions
from
rotting
leaves
and
tree
stumps
some
exhibiting
to
her
listless
gaze
their
clammy
tops
others
their
oozing
gills
some
were
marked
with
great
splotches
red
as
arterial
blood
others
were
saffron
yellow
and
others
tall
and
attenuated
with
stems
like
macaroni
some
were
leathery
and
of
richest
browns
the
hollow
seemed
a
nursery
of
pestilences
small
and
great
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
comfort
and
health
and
bathsheba
arose
with
a
tremor
at
the
thought
of
having
passed
the
night
on
the
brink
of
so
dismal
a
place
there
were
now
other
footsteps
to
be
heard
along
the
road
nerves
were
still
unstrung
she
crouched
down
out
of
sight
again
and
the
pedestrian
came
into
view
he
was
a
schoolboy
with
a
bag
slung
over
his
shoulder
containing
his
dinner
and
a
book
in
his
hand
he
paused
by
the
gate
and
without
looking
up
continued
murmuring
words
in
tones
quite
loud
enough
to
reach
her
ears
lord
o
lord
o
lord
o
lord
o
i
know
out
book
us
give
us
give
us
give
us
give
i
know
that
grace
that
grace
that
grace
i
other
words
followed
to
the
same
effect
the
boy
was
of
the
dunce
class
apparently
the
book
was
a
psalter
and
this
was
his
way
of
learning
the
collect
in
the
worst
attacks
of
trouble
there
appears
to
be
always
a
superficial
film
of
consciousness
which
is
left
disengaged
and
open
to
the
notice
of
trifles
and
bathsheba
was
faintly
amused
at
the
method
till
he
too
passed
on
by
this
time
stupor
had
given
place
to
anxiety
and
anxiety
began
to
make
room
for
hunger
and
thirst
a
form
now
appeared
upon
the
rise
on
the
other
side
of
the
swamp
by
the
mist
and
came
towards
bathsheba
the
it
was
a
with
her
face
askance
as
if
looking
earnestly
on
all
sides
of
her
when
she
got
a
little
further
round
to
the
left
and
drew
nearer
bathsheba
could
see
the
profile
against
the
sunny
sky
and
knew
the
wavy
sweep
from
forehead
to
chin
with
neither
angle
nor
decisive
line
anywhere
about
it
to
be
the
familiar
contour
of
liddy
smallbury
heart
bounded
with
gratitude
in
the
thought
that
she
was
not
altogether
deserted
and
she
jumped
up
liddy
she
said
or
attempted
to
say
but
the
words
had
only
been
framed
by
her
lips
there
came
no
sound
she
had
lost
her
voice
by
exposure
to
the
clogged
atmosphere
all
these
hours
of
night
i
am
so
glad
i
have
found
you
said
the
girl
as
soon
as
she
saw
bathsheba
come
across
bathsheba
said
in
a
whisper
which
she
vainly
endeavoured
to
make
loud
enough
to
reach
ears
liddy
not
knowing
this
stepped
down
upon
the
swamp
saying
as
she
did
so
will
bear
me
up
i
bathsheba
never
forgot
that
transient
little
picture
of
liddy
crossing
the
swamp
to
her
there
in
the
morning
light
iridescent
bubbles
of
dank
subterranean
breath
rose
from
the
sweating
sod
beside
the
feet
as
she
trod
hissing
as
they
burst
and
expanded
away
to
join
the
vapoury
firmament
above
liddy
did
not
sink
as
bathsheba
had
anticipated
she
landed
safely
on
the
other
side
and
looked
up
at
the
beautiful
though
pale
and
weary
face
of
her
young
mistress
thing
said
liddy
with
tears
in
her
eyes
hearten
yourself
up
a
little
however
speak
above
a
voice
is
gone
for
the
present
said
bathsheba
hurriedly
suppose
the
damp
air
from
that
hollow
has
taken
it
away
liddy
question
me
mind
who
sent
i
thought
when
i
found
you
were
not
at
home
that
something
cruel
had
happened
i
fancy
i
heard
his
voice
late
last
night
and
so
knowing
something
was
he
at
home
he
left
just
before
i
came
fanny
taken
away
yet
she
will
soon
nine
go
home
at
present
then
suppose
we
walk
about
in
this
wood
liddy
without
exactly
understanding
everything
or
anything
in
this
episode
assented
and
they
walked
together
further
among
the
trees
you
had
better
come
in
and
have
something
to
eat
you
will
die
of
a
chill
shall
not
come
indoors
i
get
you
something
to
eat
and
something
else
to
put
over
your
head
besides
that
little
shawl
you
will
liddy
vanished
and
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
returned
with
a
cloak
hat
some
slices
of
bread
and
butter
a
and
some
hot
tea
in
a
little
china
jug
fanny
gone
said
bathsheba
said
her
companion
pouring
out
the
tea
bathsheba
wrapped
herself
up
and
ate
and
drank
sparingly
her
voice
was
then
a
little
clearer
and
trifling
colour
returned
to
her
face
walk
about
again
she
said
they
wandered
about
the
wood
for
nearly
two
hours
bathsheba
replying
in
monosyllables
to
prattle
for
her
mind
ran
on
one
subject
and
one
only
she
interrupted
wonder
if
fanny
is
gone
by
this
time
will
go
and
she
came
back
with
the
information
that
the
men
were
just
taking
away
the
corpse
that
bathsheba
had
been
inquired
for
that
she
had
replied
to
the
effect
that
her
mistress
was
unwell
and
could
not
be
seen
they
think
i
am
in
my
bedroom
liddy
then
ventured
to
add
said
when
i
first
found
you
that
you
might
never
go
home
mean
it
altered
my
mind
it
is
only
women
with
no
pride
in
them
who
run
away
from
their
husbands
there
is
one
position
worse
than
that
of
being
found
dead
in
your
house
from
his
ill
usage
and
that
is
to
be
found
alive
through
having
gone
away
to
the
house
of
somebody
else
thought
of
it
all
this
morning
and
chosen
my
course
a
runaway
wife
is
an
encumbrance
to
everybody
a
burden
to
herself
and
a
of
which
make
up
a
heap
of
misery
greater
than
any
that
comes
by
staying
at
this
may
include
the
trifling
items
of
insult
beating
and
starvation
liddy
if
ever
you
forbid
that
you
ever
should
find
yourself
in
a
fearful
situation
but
mind
this
you
flinch
stand
your
ground
and
be
cut
to
pieces
what
going
to
mistress
talk
so
said
liddy
taking
her
hand
i
knew
you
had
too
much
sense
to
bide
away
may
i
ask
what
dreadful
thing
it
is
that
has
happened
between
you
and
him
may
ask
but
i
may
not
in
about
ten
minutes
they
returned
to
the
house
by
a
circuitous
route
entering
at
the
rear
bathsheba
glided
up
the
back
stairs
to
a
disused
attic
and
her
companion
followed
she
said
with
a
lighter
heart
for
youth
and
hope
had
begun
to
reassert
themselves
are
to
be
my
confidante
for
the
must
i
choose
you
well
i
shall
take

to

at

attempting
to

at

watching
every
movement
outside
without
much
purpose
and
listening
without
much
interest
to
every
sound
the
sun
went
down
almost
that
night
and
a
livid
cloud
received
its
rays
in
the
east
up
against
this
dark
background
the

and

with

hereabouts
at
six
the
young
men
of
the
village
gathered
as
was
their
custom
for
a
game
of
base
the
spot
had
been
consecrated
to
this
ancient
diversion
from
time
immemorial
the
old
stocks
conveniently
forming
a
base
facing
the
boundary
of
the
churchyard
in
front
of
which
the
ground
was
trodden
hard
and
bare
as
a
pavement
by
the
players
she
could
see
the
brown
and
black
heads
of
the
young
lads
darting
about
right
and
left
their
white
gleaming
in
the
sun
whilst
occasionally
a
shout
and
a
peal
of
hearty
laughter
varied
the
stillness
of
the
evening
air
they
continued
playing
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
when
the
game
concluded
abruptly
and
the
players
leapt
over
the
wall
and
vanished
round
to
the
other
side
behind
a
which
was
also
half
behind
a
beech
now
spreading
in
one
mass
of
golden
foliage
on
which
the
branches
traced
black
lines

the
finish
their
game
so
suddenly
bathsheba
inquired
the
next
time
that
liddy
entered
the
room

because
two
men
came
just
then
from

and
began
putting
up

grand
carved
tombstone

romanticism
when
wife
had
left
the
house
at
the
previous
midnight
his
first
act
was
to
cover
the
dead
from
sight
this
done
he
ascended
the
stairs
and
throwing
himself
down
upon
the
bed
dressed
as
he
was
he
waited
miserably
for
the
morning
fate
had
dealt
grimly
with
him
through
the
last
hours
his
day
had
been
spent
in
a
way
which
varied
very
materially
from
his
intentions
regarding
it
there
is
always
an
inertia
to
be
overcome
in
striking
out
a
new
line
of
more
in
ourselves
it
seems
than
in
circumscribing
events
which
appear
as
if
leagued
together
to
allow
no
novelties
in
the
way
of
amelioration
twenty
pounds
having
been
secured
from
bathsheba
he
had
managed
to
add
to
the
sum
every
farthing
he
could
muster
on
his
own
account
which
had
been
seven
pounds
ten
with
this
money
pounds
ten
in
all
he
had
hastily
driven
from
the
gate
that
morning
to
keep
his
appointment
with
fanny
robin
on
reaching
casterbridge
he
left
the
horse
and
trap
at
an
inn
and
at
five
minutes
before
ten
came
back
to
the
bridge
at
the
lower
end
of
the
town
and
sat
himself
upon
the
parapet
the
clocks
struck
the
hour
and
no
fanny
appeared
in
fact
at
that
moment
she
was
being
robed
in
her
by
two
attendants
at
the
union
first
and
last
the
gentle
creature
had
ever
been
honoured
with
the
quarter
went
the
half
hour
a
rush
of
recollection
came
upon
troy
as
he
waited
this
was
the
second
time
she
had
broken
a
serious
engagement
with
him
in
anger
he
vowed
it
should
be
the
last
and
at
eleven
when
he
had
lingered
and
watched
the
stone
of
the
bridge
till
he
knew
every
lichen
upon
their
face
and
heard
the
chink
of
the
ripples
underneath
till
they
oppressed
him
he
jumped
from
his
seat
went
to
the
inn
for
his
gig
and
in
a
bitter
mood
of
indifference
concerning
the
past
and
recklessness
about
the
future
drove
on
to
budmouth
races
he
reached
the
at
two
and
remained
either
there
or
in
the
town
till
nine
but
image
as
it
had
appeared
to
him
in
the
sombre
shadows
of
that
saturday
evening
returned
to
his
mind
backed
up
by
reproaches
he
vowed
he
would
not
bet
and
he
kept
his
vow
for
on
leaving
the
town
at
nine
in
the
evening
he
had
diminished
his
cash
only
to
the
extent
of
a
few
shillings
he
trotted
slowly
homeward
and
it
was
now
that
he
was
struck
for
the
first
time
with
a
thought
that
fanny
had
been
really
prevented
by
illness
from
keeping
her
promise
this
time
she
could
have
made
no
mistake
he
regretted
that
he
had
not
remained
in
casterbridge
and
made
inquiries
reaching
home
he
quietly
unharnessed
the
horse
and
came
indoors
as
we
have
seen
to
the
fearful
shock
that
awaited
him
as
soon
as
it
grew
light
enough
to
distinguish
objects
troy
arose
from
the
coverlet
of
the
bed
and
in
a
mood
of
absolute
indifference
to
whereabouts
and
almost
oblivious
of
her
existence
he
stalked
downstairs
and
left
the
house
by
the
back
door
his
walk
was
towards
the
churchyard
entering
which
he
searched
around
till
he
found
a
newly
dug
unoccupied
grave
dug
the
day
before
for
fanny
the
position
of
this
having
been
marked
he
hastened
on
to
casterbridge
only
pausing
and
musing
for
a
while
at
the
hill
whereon
he
had
last
seen
fanny
alive
reaching
the
town
troy
descended
into
a
side
street
and
entered
a
pair
of
gates
surmounted
by
a
board
bearing
the
words
stone
and
marble
within
were
lying
about
stones
of
all
sizes
and
designs
inscribed
as
being
sacred
to
the
memory
of
unnamed
persons
who
had
not
yet
died
troy
was
so
unlike
himself
now
in
look
word
and
deed
that
the
want
of
likeness
was
perceptible
even
to
his
own
consciousness
his
method
of
engaging
himself
in
this
business
of
purchasing
a
tomb
was
that
of
an
absolutely
unpractised
man
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
consider
calculate
or
economize
he
waywardly
wished
for
something
and
he
set
about
obtaining
it
like
a
child
in
a
nursery
want
a
good
tomb
he
said
to
the
man
who
stood
in
a
little
office
within
the
yard
want
as
good
a
one
as
you
can
give
me
for
it
was
all
the
money
he
possessed
sum
to
include
everything
cutting
the
name
carriage
to
weatherbury
and
erection
and
i
want
it
now
at
could
not
get
anything
special
worked
this
must
have
it
you
would
like
one
of
these
in
stock
it
could
be
got
ready
well
said
troy
impatiently
see
what
you
best
i
have
in
stock
is
this
one
said
the
going
into
a
shed
a
marble
headstone
beautifully
crocketed
with
medallions
beneath
of
typical
subjects
the
footstone
after
the
same
pattern
and
the
coping
to
enclose
the
grave
the
polishing
alone
of
the
set
cost
me
eleven
slabs
are
the
best
of
their
kind
and
i
can
warrant
them
to
resist
rain
and
frost
for
a
hundred
years
without
how
much
i
could
add
the
name
and
put
it
up
at
weatherbury
for
the
sum
you
it
done
and
pay
the
money
the
man
agreed
and
wondered
at
such
a
mood
in
a
visitor
who
wore
not
a
shred
of
mourning
troy
then
wrote
the
words
which
were
to
form
the
inscription
settled
the
account
and
went
away
in
the
afternoon
he
came
back
again
and
found
that
the
lettering
was
almost
done
he
waited
in
the
yard
till
the
tomb
was
packed
and
saw
it
placed
in
the
cart
and
starting
on
its
way
to
weatherbury
giving
directions
to
the
two
men
who
were
to
accompany
it
to
inquire
of
the
sexton
for
the
grave
of
the
person
named
in
the
inscription
it
was
quite
dark
when
troy
came
out
of
casterbridge
he
carried
rather
a
heavy
basket
upon
his
arm
with
which
he
strode
moodily
along
the
road
resting
occasionally
at
bridges
and
gates
whereon
he
deposited
his
burden
for
a
time
midway
on
his
journey
he
met
returning
in
the
darkness
the
men
and
the
waggon
which
had
conveyed
the
tomb
he
merely
inquired
if
the
work
was
done
and
on
being
assured
that
it
was
passed
on
again
troy
entered
weatherbury
churchyard
about
ten
and
went
immediately
to
the
corner
where
he
had
marked
the
vacant
grave
early
in
the
morning
it
was
on
the
obscure
side
of
the
tower
screened
to
a
great
extent
from
the
view
of
passers
along
the
spot
which
until
lately
had
been
abandoned
to
heaps
of
stones
and
bushes
of
alder
but
now
it
was
cleared
and
made
orderly
for
interments
by
reason
of
the
rapid
filling
of
the
ground
elsewhere
here
now
stood
the
tomb
as
the
men
had
stated
and
shapely
in
the
gloom
consisting
of
head
and
and
enclosing
border
of
uniting
them
in
the
midst
was
mould
suitable
for
plants
troy
deposited
his
basket
beside
the
tomb
and
vanished
for
a
few
minutes
when
he
returned
he
carried
a
spade
and
a
lantern
the
light
of
which
he
directed
for
a
few
moments
upon
the
marble
whilst
he
read
the
inscription
he
hung
his
lantern
on
the
lowest
bough
of
the
and
took
from
his
basket
of
several
varieties
there
were
bundles
of
hyacinth
and
crocus
bulbs
violets
and
double
daisies
which
were
to
bloom
in
early
spring
and
of
carnations
pinks
picotees
lilies
of
the
valley
farewell
and
others
for
the
later
seasons
of
the
year
troy
laid
these
out
upon
the
grass
and
with
an
impassive
face
set
to
work
to
plant
them
the
snowdrops
were
arranged
in
a
line
on
the
outside
of
the
coping
the
remainder
within
the
enclosure
of
the
grave
the
crocuses
and
hyacinths
were
to
grow
in
rows
some
of
the
summer
flowers
he
placed
over
her
head
and
feet
the
lilies
and
over
her
heart
the
remainder
were
dispersed
in
the
spaces
between
these
troy
in
his
prostration
at
this
time
had
no
perception
that
in
the
futility
of
these
romantic
doings
dictated
by
a
remorseful
reaction
from
previous
indifference
there
was
any
element
of
absurdity
deriving
his
idiosyncrasies
from
both
sides
of
the
channel
he
showed
at
such
junctures
as
the
present
the
inelasticity
of
the
englishman
together
with
that
blindness
to
the
line
where
sentiment
verges
on
mawkishness
characteristic
of
the
french
it
was
a
cloudy
muggy
and
very
dark
night
and
the
rays
from
lantern
spread
into
the
two
old
yews
with
a
strange
illuminating
power
flickering
as
it
seemed
up
to
the
black
ceiling
of
cloud
above
he
felt
a
large
drop
of
rain
upon
the
back
of
his
hand
and
presently
one
came
and
entered
one
of
the
holes
of
the
lantern
whereupon
the
candle
sputtered
and
went
out
troy
was
weary
and
it
being
now
not
far
from
midnight
and
the
rain
threatening
to
increase
he
resolved
to
leave
the
finishing
touches
of
his
labour
until
the
day
should
break
he
groped
along
the
wall
and
over
the
graves
in
the
dark
till
he
found
himself
round
at
the
north
side
here
he
entered
the
porch
and
reclining
upon
the
bench
within
fell
asleep
chapter

the
gurgoyle
its
doings
the
tower
of
weatherbury
church
was
a
square
erection
of
date
having
two
stone
gurgoyles
on
each
of
the
four
faces
of
its
parapet
of
these
eight
carved
protuberances
only
two
at
this
time
continued
to
serve
the
purpose
of
their
of
spouting
the
water
from
the
lead
roof
within
one
mouth
in
each
front
had
been
closed
by
bygone
as
superfluous
and
two
others
were
broken
away
and
matter
not
of
much
consequence
to
the
wellbeing
of
the
tower
for
the
two
mouths
which
still
remained
open
and
active
were
gaping
enough
to
do
all
the
work
it
has
been
sometimes
argued
that
there
is
no
truer
criterion
of
the
vitality
of
any
given
than
the
power
of
the
of
that
time
in
grotesque
and
certainly
in
the
instance
of
gothic
art
there
is
no
disputing
the
proposition
weatherbury
tower
was
a
somewhat
early
instance
of
the
use
of
an
ornamental
parapet
in
parish
as
distinct
from
cathedral
churches
and
the
gurgoyles
which
are
the
necessary
correlatives
of
a
parapet
were
exceptionally
the
boldest
cut
that
the
hand
could
shape
and
of
the
most
original
design
that
a
human
brain
could
conceive
there
was
so
to
speak
that
symmetry
in
their
distortion
which
is
less
the
characteristic
of
british
than
of
continental
grotesques
of
the
period
all
the
eight
were
different
from
each
other
a
beholder
was
convinced
that
nothing
on
earth
could
be
more
hideous
than
those
he
saw
on
the
north
side
until
he
went
round
to
the
south
of
the
two
on
this
latter
face
only
that
at
the
corner
concerns
the
story
it
was
too
human
to
be
called
like
a
dragon
too
impish
to
be
like
a
man
too
animal
to
be
like
a
fiend
and
not
enough
like
a
bird
to
be
called
a
griffin
this
horrible
stone
entity
was
fashioned
as
if
covered
with
a
wrinkled
hide
it
had
short
erect
ears
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
and
its
fingers
and
hands
were
seizing
the
corners
of
its
mouth
which
they
thus
seemed
to
pull
open
to
give
free
passage
to
the
water
it
vomited
the
lower
row
of
teeth
was
quite
washed
away
though
the
upper
still
remained
here
and
thus
jutting
a
couple
of
feet
from
the
wall
against
which
its
feet
rested
as
a
support

for

laughed
at
the
surrounding

voicelessly
in

a
gurgling
and
snorting
sound
troy
slept
on
in
the
porch
and
the
rain
increased
outside
presently
the
gurgoyle
spat
in
due
time
a
small
stream
began
to
trickle
through
the
seventy
feet
of
aerial
space
between
its
mouth
and
the
ground
which
the
smote
like
duckshot
in

the

thickened
in

gradually
spouting
further
and

further
from

side
of

fell
in

the
ground
and
there
was
now
nothing
to
resist
the
but
the
bare
earth
for
several
years
the
stream
had
not
spouted
so
far
from
the
tower
as
it
was
doing
on
this
night
and
such
a
contingency
had
been
sometimes
this
obscure
corner
received
no
inhabitant
for
the
space
of
two
or
three
years
and
then
it
was
usually
but
a
pauper
a
poacher
or
other
sinner
of
undignified
sins
the
persistent
torrent
from
the
jaws
directed
all
its
vengeance
into
the
grave
the
rich
tawny
mould
was
stirred
into
motion
and
boiled
like
chocolate
the
water
accumulated
and
washed
deeper
down
and
the
roar
of
the
pool
thus
formed
spread
into
the
night
as
the
head
and
chief
among
other
noises
of
the
kind
created
by
the
deluging
rain
the
flowers
so
carefully
planted
by
repentant
lover
began
to
move
and
writhe
in
their
bed
the
turned
slowly
upside
down
and
became
a
mere
mat
of
mud
soon
the
snowdrop
and
other
bulbs
danced
in
the
boiling
mass
like
ingredients
in
a
cauldron
plants
of
the
tufted
species
were
loosened
rose
to
the
surface
and
floated
off
troy
did
not
awake
from
his
comfortless
sleep
till
it
was
broad
day
not
having
been
in
bed
for
two
nights
his
shoulders
felt
stiff
his
feet
tender
and
his
head
heavy
he
remembered
his
position
arose
shivered
took
the
spade
and
again
went
out
the
rain
had
quite
ceased
and
the
sun
was
shining
through
the
green
brown
and
yellow
leaves
now
sparkling
and
varnished
by
the
raindrops
to
the
brightness
of
similar
effects
in
the
landscapes
of
ruysdael
and
hobbema
and
full
of
all
those
infinite
beauties
that
arise
from
the
union
of
water
and
colour
with
high
lights
the
air
was
rendered
so
transparent
by
the
heavy
fall
of
rain
that
the
autumn
hues
of
the
middle
distance
were
as
rich
as
those
near
at
hand
and
the
remote
fields
intercepted
by
the
angle
of
the
tower
appeared
in
the
same
plane
as
the
tower
itself
he
entered
the
gravel
path
which
would
take
him
behind
the
tower
the
path
instead
of
being
stony
as
it
had
been
the
night
before
was
browned
over
with
a
thin
coating
of
mud
at
one
place
in
the
path
he
saw
a
tuft
of
stringy
roots
washed
white
and
clean
as
a
bundle
of
tendons
he
picked
it
it
could
not
be
one
of
the
primroses
he
had
planted
he
saw
a
bulb
another
and
another
as
he
advanced
beyond
doubt
they
were
the
crocuses
with
a
face
of
perplexed
dismay
troy
turned
the
corner
and
then
beheld
the
wreck
the
stream
had
made
the
pool
upon
the
grave
had
soaked
away
into
the
ground
and
in
its
place
was
a
hollow
the
disturbed
earth
was
washed
over
the
grass
and
pathway
in
the
guise
of
the
brown
mud
he
had
already
seen
and
it
spotted
the
marble
tombstone
with
the
same
stains
nearly
all
the
flowers
were
washed
clean
out
of
the
ground
and
they
lay
roots
upwards
on
the
spots
whither
they
had
been
splashed
by
the
stream
brow
became
heavily
contracted
he
set
his
teeth
closely
and
his
compressed
lips
moved
as
those
of
one
in
great
pain
this
singular
accident
by
a
strange
confluence
of
emotions
in
him
was
felt
as
the
sharpest
sting
of
all
face
was
very
expressive
and
any
observer
who
had
seen
him
now
would
hardly
have
believed
him
to
be
a
man
who
had
laughed
and
sung
and
poured
into
a
ear
to
curse
his
miserable
lot
was
at
first
his
impulse
but
even
that
lowest
stage
of
rebellion
needed
an
activity
whose
absence
was
necessarily
antecedent
to
the
existence
of
the
morbid
misery
which
wrung
him
the
sight
coming
as
it
did
superimposed
upon
the
other
dark
scenery
of
the
previous
days
formed
a
sort
of
climax
to
the
whole
panorama
and
it
was
more
than
he
could
endure
sanguine
by
nature
troy
had
a
power
of
eluding
grief
by
simply
adjourning
it
he
could
put
off
the
consideration
of
any
particular
spectre
till
the
matter
had
become
old
and
softened
by
time
the
planting
of
flowers
on
grave
had
been
perhaps
but
a
species
of
elusion
of
the
primary
grief
and
now
it
was
as
if
his
intention
had
been
known
and
circumvented
almost
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
troy
as
he
stood
by
this
dismantled
grave
wished
himself
another
man
it
is
seldom
that
a
person
with
much
animal
spirit
does
not
feel
that
the
fact
of
his
life
being
his
own
is
the
one
qualification
which
singles
it
out
as
a
more
hopeful
life
than
that
of
others
who
may
actually
resemble
him
in
every
particular
troy
had
felt
in
his
transient
way
hundreds
of
times
that
he
could
not
envy
other
people
their
condition
because
the
possession
of
that
condition
would
have
necessitated
a
different
personality
when
he
desired
no
other
than
his
own
he
had
not
minded
the
peculiarities
of
his
birth
the
vicissitudes
of
his
life
the
uncertainty
of
all
that
related
to
him
because
these
appertained
to
the
hero
of
his
story
without
whom
there
would
have
been
no
story
at
all
for
him
and
it
seemed
to
be
only
in
the
nature
of
things
that
matters
would
right
themselves
at
some
proper
date
and
wind
up
well
this
very
morning
the
illusion
completed
its
disappearance
and
as
it
were
all
of
a
sudden
troy
hated
himself
the
suddenness
was
probably
more
apparent
than
real
a
coral
reef
which
just
comes
short
of
the
ocean
surface
is
no
more
to
the
horizon
than
if
it
had
never
been
begun
and
the
mere
finishing
stroke
is
what
often
appears
to
create
an
event
which
has
long
been
potentially
an
accomplished
thing
he
stood
and
miserable
man
whither
should
he
go
that
is
accursed
let
him
be
accursed
still
was
the
pitiless
anathema
written
in
this
spoliated
effort
of
his
solicitousness
a
man
who
has
spent
his
primal
strength
in
journeying
in
one
direction
has
not
much
spirit
left
for
reversing
his
course
troy
had
since
yesterday
faintly
reversed
his
but
the
merest
opposition
had
disheartened
him
to
turn
about
would
have
been
hard
enough
under
the
greatest
providential
encouragement
but
to
find
that
providence
far
from
helping
him
into
a
new
course
or
showing
any
wish
that
he
might
adopt
one
actually
jeered
his
first
trembling
and
critical
attempt
in
that
kind
was
more
than
nature
could
bear
he
slowly
withdrew
from
the
grave
he
did
not
attempt
to
fill
up
the
hole
replace
the
flowers
or
do
anything
at
all
he
simply
threw
up
his
cards
and
forswore
his
game
for
that
time
and
always
going
out
of
the
churchyard
silently
and
of
the
villagers
having
yet
passed
down
some
fields
at
the
back
and
emerged
just
as
secretly
upon
the
high
road
shortly
afterwards
he
had
gone
from
the
village
meanwhile
bathsheba
remained
a
voluntary
prisoner
in
the
attic
the
door
was
kept
locked
except
during
the
entries
and
exits
of
liddy
for
whom
a
bed
had
been
arranged
in
a
small
adjoining
room
the
light
of
lantern
in
the
churchyard
was
noticed
about
ten
by
the
who
casually
glanced
from
the
window
in
that
direction
whilst
taking
her
supper
and
she
called
attention
to
it
they
looked
curiously
at
the
phenomenon
for
a
time
until
liddy
was
sent
to
bed
bathsheba
did
not
sleep
very
heavily
that
night
when
her
attendant
was
unconscious
and
softly
breathing
in
the
next
room
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
still
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
faint
gleam
spreading
from
among
the
in
a
steady
shine
but
blinking
like
a
revolving
though
this
appearance
failed
to
suggest
to
her
that
a
person
was
passing
and
repassing
in
front
of
it
bathsheba
sat
here
till
it
began
to
rain
and
the
light
vanished
when
she
withdrew
to
lie
restlessly
in
her
bed
and
in
a
worn
mind
the
lurid
scene
of
yesternight
almost
before
the
first
faint
sign
of
dawn
appeared
she
arose
again
and
opened
the
window
to
obtain
a
full
breathing
of
the
new
morning
air
the
panes
being
now
wet
with
trembling
tears
left
by
the
night
rain
each
one
rounded
with
a
pale
lustre
caught
from
slashes
through
a
cloud
low
down
in
the
awakening
sky
from
the
trees
came
the
sound
of
steady
dripping
upon
the
drifted
leaves
under
them
and
from
the
direction
of
the
church
she
could
hear
another
and
not
intermittent
like
the
rest
the
purl
of
water
falling
into
a
pool
liddy
knocked
at
eight
and
bathsheba
unlocked
the
door
a
heavy
rain
had
in
the
night
said
liddy
when
her
inquiries
about
breakfast
had
been
made
very
you
hear
the
strange
noise
from
the
churchyard
heard
one
strange
noise
been
thinking
it
must
have
been
the
water
from
the
tower
what
the
shepherd
was
saying
now
gone
on
to
gabriel
has
been
here
this
morning
just
looked
in
in
in
his
old
way
which
i
thought
he
had
left
off
lately
but
the
tower
spouts
used
to
spatter
on
the
stones
and
we
are
puzzled
for
this
was
like
the
boiling
of
a
not
being
able
to
read
think
or
work
bathsheba
asked
liddy
to
stay
and
breakfast
with
her
the
tongue
of
the
more
childish
woman
still
ran
upon
recent
events
you
going
across
to
the
church
she
asked
that
i
know
of
said
bathsheba
thought
you
might
like
to
go
and
see
where
they
have
put
fanny
the
trees
hide
the
place
from
your
bathsheba
had
all
sorts
of
dreads
about
meeting
her
husband
mr
troy
been
in
she
said
i
think
gone
to
budmouth
the
sound
of
the
word
carried
with
it
a
much
diminished
perspective
of
him
and
his
deeds
there
were
thirteen
miles
interval
betwixt
them
now
she
hated
questioning
liddy
about
her
movements
and
indeed
had
hitherto
sedulously
avoided
doing
so
but
now
all
the
house
knew
that
there
had
been
some
dreadful
disagreement
between
them
and
it
was
futile
to
attempt
disguise
bathsheba
had
reached
a
stage
at
which
people
cease
to
have
any
appreciative
regard
for
public
opinion
makes
you
think
he
has
gone
there
she
said
tall
saw
him
on
the
budmouth
road
this
morning
before
bathsheba
was
momentarily
relieved
of
that
wayward
heaviness
of
the
past
hours
which
had
quenched
the
vitality
of
youth
in
her
without
substituting
the
philosophy
of
maturer
years
and
she
resolved
to
go
out
and
walk
a
little
way
so
when
breakfast
was
over
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
took
a
direction
towards
the
church
it
was
nine
and
the
men
having
returned
to
work
again
from
their
first
meal
she
was
not
likely
to
meet
many
of
them
in
the
road
knowing
that
fanny
had
been
laid
in
the
quarter
of
the
graveyard
called
in
the
parish
church
which
was
invisible
from
the
road
it
was
impossible
to
resist
the
impulse
to
enter
and
look
upon
a
spot
which
from
nameless
feelings
she
at
the
same
time
dreaded
to
see
she
had
been
unable
to
overcome
an
impression
that
some
connection
existed
between
her
rival
and
the
light
through
the
trees
bathsheba
skirted
the
buttress
and
beheld
the
hole
and
the
tomb
its
delicately
veined
surface
splashed
and
stained
just
as
troy
had
seen
it
and
left
it
two
hours
earlier
on
the
other
side
of
the
scene
stood
gabriel
his
eyes
too
were
fixed
on
the
tomb
and
her
arrival
having
been
noiseless
she
had
not
as
yet
attracted
his
attention
bathsheba
did
not
at
once
perceive
that
the
grand
tomb
and
the
disturbed
grave
were
and
she
looked
on
both
sides
and
around
for
some
humbler
mound
earthed
up
and
clodded
in
the
usual
way
then
her
eye
followed
and
she
read
the
words
with
which
the
inscription
opened
erected
by
francis
troy
in
beloved
memory
of
fanny
robin
oak
saw
her
and
his
first
act
was
to
gaze
inquiringly
and
learn
how
she
received
this
knowledge
of
the
authorship
of
the
work
which
to
himself
had
caused
considerable
astonishment
but
such
discoveries
did
not
much
affect
her
now
emotional
convulsions
seemed
to
have
become
the
commonplaces
of
her
history
and
she
bade
him
good
morning
and
asked
him
to
fill
in
the
hole
with
the
spade
which
was
standing
by
whilst
oak
was
doing
as
she
desired
bathsheba
collected
the
flowers
and
began
planting
them
with
that
sympathetic
manipulation
of
roots
and
leaves
which
is
so
conspicuous
in
a
gardening
and
which
flowers
seem
to
understand
and
thrive
upon
she
requested
oak
to
get
the
churchwardens
to
turn
the
leadwork
at
the
mouth
of
the
gurgoyle
that
hung
gaping
down
upon
them
that
by
this
means
the
stream
might
be
directed
sideways
and
a
repetition
of
the
accident
prevented
finally
with
the
superfluous
magnanimity
of
a
woman
whose
narrower
instincts
have
brought
down
bitterness
upon
her
instead
of
love
she
wiped
the
mud
spots
from
the
tomb
as
if
she
rather
liked
its
words
than
otherwise
and
went
again
home
chapter
xlvii
adventures
by
the
shore
troy
wandered
along
towards
the
south
a
composite
feeling
made
up
of
disgust
with
the
to
him
humdrum
tediousness
of
a
life
gloomy
images
of
her
who
lay
in
the
churchyard
remorse
and
a
general
averseness
to
his
society
impelled
him
to
seek
a
home
in
any
place
on
earth
save
weatherbury
the
sad
accessories
of
end
confronted
him
as
vivid
pictures
which
threatened
to
be
indelible
and
made
life
in
house
intolerable
at
three
in
the
afternoon
he
found
himself
at
the
foot
of
a
slope
more
than
a
mile
in
length
which
ran
to
the
ridge
of
a
range
of
hills
lying
parallel
with
the
shore
and
forming
a
monotonous
barrier
between
the
basin
of
cultivated
country
inland
and
the
wilder
scenery
of
the
coast
up
the
hill
stretched
a
road
nearly
straight
and
perfectly
white
the
two
sides
approaching
each
other
in
a
gradual
taper
till
they
met
the
sky
at
the
top
about
two
miles
off
throughout
the
length
of
this
narrow
and
irksome
inclined
plane
not
a
sign
of
life
was
visible
on
this
garish
afternoon
troy
toiled
up
the
road
with
a
languor
and
depression
greater
than
any
he
had
experienced
for
many
a
day
and
year
before
the
air
was
warm
and
muggy
and
the
top
seemed
to
recede
as
he
approached
at
last
he
reached
the
summit
and
a
wide
and
novel
prospect
burst
upon
him
with
an
effect
almost
like
that
of
the
pacific
upon
gaze
the
broad
steely
sea
marked
only
by
faint
lines
which
had
a
semblance
of
being
etched
thereon
to
a
degree
not
deep
enough
to
disturb
its
general
evenness
stretched
the
whole
width
of
his
front
and
round
to
the
right
where
near
the
town
and
port
of
budmouth
the
sun
bristled
down
upon
it
and
banished
all
colour
to
substitute
in
its
place
a
clear
oily
polish
nothing
moved
in
sky
land
or
sea
except
a
frill
of
milkwhite
foam
along
the
nearer
angles
of
the
shore
shreds
of
which
licked
the
contiguous
stones
like
tongues
he
descended
and
came
to
a
small
basin
of
sea
enclosed
by
the
cliffs
nature
freshened
within
him
he
thought
he
would
rest
and
bathe
here
before
going
farther
he
undressed
and
plunged
in
inside
the
cove
the
water
was
uninteresting
to
a
swimmer
being
smooth
as
a
pond
and
to
get
a
little
of
the
ocean
swell
troy
presently
swam
between
the
two
projecting
spurs
of
rock
which
formed
the
pillars
of
hercules
to
this
miniature
mediterranean
unfortunately
for
troy
a
current
unknown
to
him
existed
outside
which
unimportant
to
craft
of
any
burden
was
awkward
for
a
swimmer
who
might
be
taken
in
it
unawares
troy
found
himself
carried
to
the
left
and
then
round
in
a
swoop
out
to
sea
he
now
recollected
the
place
and
its
sinister
character
many
bathers
had
there
prayed
for
a
dry
death
from
time
to
time
and
like
gonzalo
also
had
been
unanswered
and
troy
began
to
deem
it
possible
that
he
might
be
added
to
their
number
not
a
boat
of
any
kind
was
at
present
within
sight
but
far
in
the
distance
budmouth
lay
upon
the
sea
as
it
were
quietly
regarding
his
efforts
and
beside
the
town
the
harbour
showed
its
position
by
a
dim
meshwork
of
ropes
and
spars
after
exhausting
himself
in
attempts
to
get
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
cove
in
his
weakness
swimming
several
inches
deeper
than
was
his
wont
keeping
up
his
breathing
entirely
by
his
nostrils
turning
upon
his
back
a
dozen
times
over
swimming
and
so
on
troy
resolved
as
a
last
resource
to
tread
water
at
a
slight
incline
and
so
endeavour
to
reach
the
shore
at
any
point
merely
giving
himself
a
gentle
impetus
inwards
whilst
carried
on
in
the
general
direction
of
the
tide
this
necessarily
a
slow
process
he
found
to
be
not
altogether
so
difficult
and
though
there
was
no
choice
of
a
objects
on
shore
passing
by
him
in
a
sad
and
slow
perceptibly
approached
the
extremity
of
a
spit
of
land
yet
further
to
the
right
now
well
defined
against
the
sunny
portion
of
the
horizon
while
the
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
spit
as
his
only
means
of
salvation
on
this
side
of
the
unknown
a
moving
object
broke
the
outline
of
the
extremity
and
immediately
a
boat
appeared
manned
with
several
sailor
lads
her
bows
towards
the
sea
all
vigour
spasmodically
revived
to
prolong
the
struggle
yet
a
little
further
swimming
with
his
right
arm
he
held
up
his
left
to
hail
them
splashing
upon
the
waves
and
shouting
with
all
his
might
from
the
position
of
the
setting
sun
his
white
form
was
distinctly
visible
upon
the
now
bosom
of
the
sea
to
the
east
of
the
boat
and
the
men
saw
him
at
once
backing
their
oars
and
putting
the
boat
about
they
pulled
towards
him
with
a
will
and
in
five
or
six
minutes
from
the
time
of
his
first
halloo
two
of
the
sailors
hauled
him
in
over
the
stern
they
formed
part
of
a
crew
and
had
come
ashore
for
sand
lending
him
what
little
clothing
they
could
spare
among
them
as
a
slight
protection
against
the
rapidly
cooling
air
they
agreed
to
land
him
in
the
morning
and
without
further
delay
for
it
was
growing
late
they
made
again
towards
the
roadstead
where
their
vessel
lay
and
now
night
drooped
slowly
upon
the
wide
watery
levels
in
front
and
at
no
great
distance
from
them
where
the
shoreline
curved
round
and
formed
a
long
riband
of
shade
upon
the
horizon
a
series
of
points
of
yellow
light
began
to
start
into
existence
denoting
the
spot
to
be
the
site
of
budmouth
where
the
lamps
were
being
lighted
along
the
parade
the
cluck
of
their
oars
was
the
only
sound
of
any
distinctness
upon
the
sea
and
as
they
laboured
amid
the
thickening
shades
the
grew
larger
each
appearing
to
send
a
flaming
sword
deep
down
into
the
waves
before
it
until
there
arose
among
other
dim
shapes
of
the
kind
the
form
of
the
vessel
for
which
they
were
bound

doubts
linger
bathsheba
underwent
the
enlargement
of
her
absence
from
hours
to
days
with
a
slight
feeling
of
surprise
and
a
slight
feeling
of
relief
yet
neither
sensation
rose
at
any
time
far
above
the
level
commonly
designated
as
indifference
she
belonged
to
him
the
certainties
of
that
position
were
so
well
defined
and
the
reasonable
probabilities
of
its
issue
so
bounded
that
she
could
not
speculate
on
contingencies
taking
no
further
interest
in
herself
as
a
splendid
woman
she
acquired
the
indifferent
feelings
of
an
outsider
in
contemplating
her
probable
fate
as
a
singular
wretch
for
bathsheba
drew
herself
and
her
future
in
colours
that
no
reality
could
exceed
for
darkness
her
original
vigorous
pride
of
youth
had
sickened
and
with
it
had
declined
all
her
anxieties
about
coming
years
since
anxiety
recognizes
a
better
and
a
worse
alternative
and
bathsheba
had
made
up
her
mind
that
alternatives
on
any
noteworthy
scale
had
ceased
for
her
soon
or
that
not
very
husband
would
be
home
again
and
then
the
days
of
their
tenancy
of
the
upper
farm
would
be
numbered
there
had
originally
been
shown
by
the
agent
to
the
estate
some
distrust
of
tenure
as
james
successor
on
the
score
of
her
sex
and
her
youth
and
her
beauty
but
the
peculiar
nature
of
her
will
his
own
frequent
testimony
before
his
death
to
her
cleverness
in
such
a
pursuit
and
her
vigorous
marshalling
of
the
numerous
flocks
and
herds
which
came
suddenly
into
her
hands
before
negotiations
were
concluded
had
won
confidence
in
her
powers
and
no
further
objections
had
been
raised
she
had
latterly
been
in
great
doubt
as
to
what
the
legal
effects
of
her
marriage
would
be
upon
her
position
but
no
notice
had
been
taken
as
yet
of
her
change
of
name
and
only
one
point
was
in
the
event
of
her
own
or
her
inability
to
meet
the
agent
at
the
forthcoming
january
very
little
consideration
would
be
shown
and
for
that
matter
very
little
would
be
deserved
once
out
of
the
farm
the
approach
of
poverty
would
be
sure
hence
bathsheba
lived
in
a
perception
that
her
purposes
were
broken
off
she
was
not
a
woman
who
could
hope
on
without
good
materials
for
the
process
differing
thus
from
the
less
and
energetic
though
more
petted
ones
of
the
sex
with
whom
hope
goes
on
as
a
sort
of
clockwork
which
the
merest
food
and
shelter
are
sufficient
to
wind
up
and
perceiving
clearly
that
her
mistake
had
been
a
fatal
one
she
accepted
her
position
and
waited
coldly
for
the
end
the
first
saturday
after
departure
she
went
to
casterbridge
alone
a
journey
she
had
not
before
taken
since
her
marriage
on
this
saturday
bathsheba
was
passing
slowly
on
foot
through
the
crowd
of
rural
gathered
as
usual
in
front
of
the
who
were
as
usual
gazed
upon
by
the
burghers
with
feelings
that
those
healthy
lives
were
dearly
paid
for
by
exclusion
from
possible
aldermanship
when
a
man
who
had
apparently
been
following
her
said
some
words
to
another
on
her
left
hand
ears
were
keen
as
those
of
any
wild
animal
and
she
distinctly
heard
what
the
speaker
said
though
her
back
was
towards
him
am
looking
for
mrs
troy
is
that
she
there
the
young
lady
i
believe
said
the
the
person
addressed
have
some
awkward
news
to
break
to
her
her
husband
is
as
if
endowed
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
bathsheba
gasped
out
it
is
not
true
it
can
not
be
true
then
she
said
and
heard
no
more
the
ice
of
which
had
latterly
gathered
over
her
was
broken
and
the
currents
burst
forth
again
and
overwhelmed
her
a
darkness
came
into
her
eyes
and
she
fell
but
not
to
the
ground
a
gloomy
man
who
had
been
observing
her
from
under
the
portico
of
the
old
when
she
passed
through
the
group
without
stepped
quickly
to
her
side
at
the
moment
of
her
exclamation
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
as
she
sank
down
is
it
said
boldwood
looking
up
at
the
bringer
of
the
big
news
as
he
supported
her
husband
was
drowned
this
week
while
bathing
in
lulwind
cove
a
coastguardsman
found
his
clothes
and
brought
them
into
budmouth
thereupon
a
strange
fire
lighted
up
eye
and
his
face
flushed
with
the
suppressed
excitement
of
an
unutterable
thought
glance
was
now
centred
upon
him
and
the
unconscious
bathsheba
he
lifted
her
bodily
off
the
ground
and
smoothed
down
the
folds
of
her
dress
as
a
child
might
have
taken
a
bird
and
arranged
its
ruffled
plumes
and
bore
her
along
the
pavement
to
the
arms
inn
here
he
passed
with
her
under
the
archway
into
a
private
room
and
by
the
time
he
had
precious
burden
upon
a
sofa
bathsheba
had
opened
her
eyes
remembering
all
that
had
occurred
she
murmured
want
to
go
home
boldwood
left
the
room
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
passage
to
recover
his
senses
the
experience
had
been
too
much
for
his
consciousness
to
keep
up
with
and
now
that
he
had
grasped
it
it
had
gone
again
for
those
few
heavenly
golden
moments
she
had
been
in
his
arms
what
did
it
matter
about
her
not
knowing
it
she
had
been
close
to
his
breast
he
had
been
close
to
hers
he
started
onward
again
and
sending
a
woman
to
her
went
out
to
ascertain
all
the
facts
of
the
case
these
appeared
to
be
limited
to
what
he
had
already
heard
he
then
ordered
her
horse
to
be
put
into
the
gig
and
when
all
was
ready
returned
to
inform
her
he
found
that
though
still
pale
and
unwell
she
had
in
the
meantime
sent
for
the
budmouth
man
who
brought
the
tidings
and
learnt
from
him
all
there
was
to
know
being
hardly
in
a
condition
to
drive
home
as
she
had
driven
to
town
boldwood
with
every
delicacy
of
manner
and
feeling
offered
to
get
her
a
driver
or
to
give
her
a
seat
in
his
phaeton
which
was
more
comfortable
than
her
own
conveyance
these
proposals
bathsheba
gently
declined
and
the
farmer
at
once
departed
about
later
she
invigorated
herself
by
an
effort
and
took
her
seat
and
the
reins
as
external
appearance
much
as
if
nothing
had
happened
she
went
out
of
the
town
by
a
tortuous
back
street
and
drove
slowly
along
unconscious
of
the
road
and
the
scene
the
first
shades
of
evening
were
showing
themselves
when
bathsheba
reached
home
where
silently
alighting
and
leaving
the
horse
in
the
hands
of
the
boy
she
proceeded
at
once
upstairs
liddy
met
her
on
the
landing
the
news
had
preceded
bathsheba
to
weatherbury
by
and
liddy
looked
inquiringly
into
her
face
bathsheba
had
nothing
to
say
she
entered
her
bedroom
and
sat
by
the
window
and
thought
and
thought
till
night
enveloped
her
and
the
extreme
lines
only
of
her
shape
were
visible
somebody
came
to
the
door
knocked
and
opened
it
what
is
it
liddy
she
said
was
thinking
there
must
be
something
got
for
you
to
wear
said
liddy
with
hesitation
do
you
mean
no
no
said
bathsheba
hurriedly
i
suppose
there
must
be
something
done
for
at
present
i
think
it
is
not
not
still
do
you
know
that
said
liddy
amazed
know
it
but
it
have
been
different
or
i
have
heard
more
or
they
have
found
him
liddy
know
how
it
is
but
death
would
have
been
different
from
how
this
is
i
am
perfectly
convinced
that
he
is
still
alive
bathsheba
remained
firm
in
this
opinion
till
monday
when
two
circumstances
conjoined
to
shake
it
the
first
was
a
short
paragraph
in
the
local
newspaper
which
beyond
making
by
a
methodizing
pen
formidable
presumptive
evidence
of
death
by
drowning
contained
the
important
testimony
of
a
young
barker
of
budmouth
who
spoke
to
being
an
eyewitness
of
the
accident
in
a
letter
to
the
editor
in
this
he
stated
that
he
was
passing
over
the
cliff
on
the
remoter
side
of
the
cove
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
at
that
time
he
saw
a
bather
carried
along
in
the
current
outside
the
mouth
of
the
cove
and
guessed
in
an
instant
that
there
was
but
a
poor
chance
for
him
unless
he
should
be
possessed
of
unusual
muscular
powers
he
drifted
behind
a
projection
of
the
coast
and
barker
followed
along
the
shore
in
the
same
direction
but
by
the
time
that
he
could
reach
an
elevation
sufficiently
great
to
command
a
view
of
the
sea
beyond
dusk
had
set
in
and
nothing
further
was
to
be
seen
the
other
circumstance
was
the
arrival
of
his
clothes
when
it
became
necessary
for
her
to
examine
and
identify
this
had
virtually
been
done
long
before
by
those
who
inspected
the
letters
in
his
pockets
it
was
so
evident
to
her
in
the
midst
of
her
agitation
that
troy
had
undressed
in
the
full
conviction
of
dressing
again
almost
immediately
that
the
notion
that
anything
but
death
could
have
prevented
him
was
a
perverse
one
to
entertain
then
bathsheba
said
to
herself
that
others
were
assured
in
their
opinion
strange
that
she
should
not
be
a
strange
reflection
occurred
to
her
causing
her
face
to
flush
suppose
that
troy
had
followed
fanny
into
another
world
had
he
done
this
intentionally
yet
contrived
to
make
his
death
appear
like
an
accident
nevertheless
this
thought
of
how
the
apparent
might
differ
from
the
vivid
by
her
bygone
jealousy
of
fanny
and
the
remorse
he
had
shown
that
not
blind
her
to
the
perception
of
a
likelier
difference
less
tragic
but
to
herself
far
more
disastrous
when
alone
late
that
evening
beside
a
small
fire
and
much
calmed
down
bathsheba
took
watch
into
her
hand
which
had
been
restored
to
her
with
the
rest
of
the
articles
belonging
to
him
she
opened
the
case
as
he
had
opened
it
before
her
a
week
ago
there
was
the
little
coil
of
pale
hair
which
had
been
as
the
fuze
to
this
great
explosion
was
hers
and
she
was
his
they
should
be
gone
together
she
said
am
nothing
to
either
of
them
and
why
should
i
keep
her
hair
she
took
it
in
her
hand
and
held
it
over
the
fire
not
burn
keep
it
in
memory
of
her
poor
thing
she
added
snatching
back
her
hand
chapter
xlix
great
hope
the
later
autumn
and
the
winter
drew
on
apace
and
the
leaves
lay
thick
upon
the
turf
of
the
glades
and
the
mosses
of
the
woods
bathsheba
having
previously
been
living
in
a
state
of
suspended
feeling
which
was
not
suspense
now
lived
in
a
mood
of
quietude
which
was
not
precisely
peacefulness
while
she
had
known
him
to
be
alive
she
could
have
thought
of
his
death
with
equanimity
but
now
that
it
might
be
she
had
lost
him
she
regretted
that
he
was
not
hers
still
she
kept
the
farm
going
raked
in
her
profits
without
caring
keenly
about
them
and
expended
money
on
ventures
because
she
had
done
so
in
bygone
days
which
though
not
long
gone
by
seemed
infinitely
removed
from
her
present
she
looked
back
upon
that
past
over
a
great
gulf
as
if
she
were
now
a
dead
person
having
the
faculty
of
meditation
still
left
in
her
by
means
of
which
like
the
mouldering
gentlefolk
of
the
story
she
could
sit
and
ponder
what
a
gift
life
used
to
be
however
one
excellent
result
of
her
general
apathy
was
the
installation
of
oak
as
bailiff
but
he
having
virtually
exercised
that
function
for
a
long
time
already
the
change
beyond
the
substantial
increase
of
wages
it
brought
was
little
more
than
a
nominal
one
addressed
to
the
outside
world
boldwood
lived
secluded
and
inactive
much
of
his
wheat
and
all
his
barley
of
that
season
had
been
spoilt
by
the
rain
it
sprouted
grew
into
intricate
mats
and
was
ultimately
thrown
to
the
pigs
in
armfuls
the
strange
neglect
which
had
produced
this
ruin
and
waste
became
the
subject
of
whispered
talk
among
all
the
people
round
and
it
was
elicited
from
one
of
men
that
forgetfulness
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
for
he
had
been
reminded
of
the
danger
to
his
corn
as
many
times
and
as
persistently
as
inferiors
dared
to
do
the
sight
of
the
pigs
turning
in
disgust
from
the
rotten
ears
seemed
to
arouse
boldwood
and
he
one
evening
sent
for
oak
whether
it
was
suggested
by
recent
act
of
promotion
or
not
the
farmer
proposed
at
the
interview
that
gabriel
should
undertake
the
superintendence
of
the
lower
farm
as
well
as
of
because
of
the
necessity
boldwood
felt
for
such
aid
and
the
impossibility
of
discovering
a
more
trustworthy
man

assuredly
setting

considered
that
the
two
farms
together
were
too
extensive
for
the
observation
of
one
man
boldwood
who
was
apparently
determined
by
personal
rather
than
commercial
reasons
suggested
that
oak
should
be
furnished
with
a
horse
for
his
sole
use
when
the
plan
would
present
no
difficulty
the
two
farms
lying
side
by
side
boldwood
did
not
directly
communicate
with
her
during
these
negotiations
only
speaking
to
oak
who
was
the
throughout
all
was
harmoniously
arranged
at
last
and
we
now
see
oak
mounted
on
a
strong
cob
and
daily
trotting
the
length
and
breadth
of
about
two
thousand
acres
in
a
cheerful
spirit
of
surveillance
as
if
the
crops
all
belonged
to
actual
mistress
of
the
and
the
master
of
the
other
sitting
in
their
respective
homes
in
gloomy
and
sad
seclusion
out
of
this
there
arose
during
the
spring
succeeding
a
talk
in
the
parish
that
gabriel
oak
was
feathering
his
nest
fast
think
said
susan
tall
oak
is
coming
it
quite
the
dand
he
now
wears
shining
boots
with
hardly
a
hob
in
two
or
three
times
and
a
tall
hat
and
hardly
knows
the
name
of
smockfrock
when
i
see
people
strut
enough
to
be
cut
up
into
bantam
cocks
i
stand
dormant
with
wonder
and
says
no
more
it
was
eventually
known
that
gabriel
though
paid
a
fixed
wage
by
bathsheba
independent
of
the
fluctuations
of
agricultural
profits
had
made
an
engagement
with
boldwood
by
which
oak
was
to
receive
a
share
of
the
small
share
certainly
yet
it
was
money
of
a
higher
quality
than
mere
wages
and
capable
of
expansion
in
a
way
that
wages
were
not
some
were
beginning
to
consider
oak
a
man
for
though
his
condition
had
thus
far
improved
he
lived
in
no
better
style
than
before
occupying
the
same
cottage
paring
his
own
potatoes
mending
his
stockings
and
sometimes
even
making
his
bed
with
his
own
hands
but
as
oak
was
not
only
provokingly
indifferent
to
public
opinion
but
a
man
who
clung
persistently
to
old
habits
and
usages
simply
because
they
were
old
there
was
room
for
doubt
as
to
his
motives
a
great
hope
had
latterly
germinated
in
boldwood
whose
unreasoning
devotion
to
bathsheba
could
only
be
characterized
as
a
fond
madness
which
neither
time
nor
circumstance
evil
nor
good
report
could
weaken
or
destroy
this
fevered
hope
had
grown
up
again
like
a
grain
of
during
the
quiet
which
followed
the
hasty
conjecture
that
troy
was
drowned
he
nourished
it
fearfully
and
almost
shunned
the
contemplation
of
it
in
earnest
lest
facts
should
reveal
the
wildness
of
the
dream
bathsheba
having
at
last
been
persuaded
to
wear
mourning
her
appearance
as
she
entered
the
church
in
that
guise
was
in
itself
a
weekly
addition
to
his
faith
that
a
time
was
far
off
perhaps
yet
surely
his
waiting
on
events
should
have
its
reward
how
long
he
might
have
to
wait
he
had
not
yet
closely
considered
what
he
would
try
to
recognize
was
that
the
severe
schooling
she
had
been
subjected
to
had
made
bathsheba
much
more
considerate
than
she
had
formerly
been
of
the
feelings
of
others
and
he
trusted
that
should
she
be
willing
at
any
time
in
the
future
to
marry
any
man
at
all
that
man
would
be
himself
there
was
a
substratum
of
good
feeling
in
her
her
for
the
injury
she
had
thoughtlessly
done
him
might
be
depended
upon
now
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
before
her
infatuation
and
disappointment
it
would
be
possible
to
approach
her
by
the
channel
of
her
good
nature
and
to
suggest
a
friendly
businesslike
compact
between
them
for
fulfilment
at
some
future
day
keeping
the
passionate
side
of
his
desire
entirely
out
of
her
sight
such
was
hope
to
the
eyes
of
the
bathsheba
was
perhaps
additionally
charming
just
now
her
exuberance
of
spirit
was
pruned
down
the
original
phantom
of
delight
had
shown
herself
to
be
not
too
bright
for
human
daily
food
and
she
had
been
able
to
enter
this
second
poetical
phase
without
losing
much
of
the
first
in
the
process
return
from
a
two
visit
to
her
old
aunt
at
norcombe
afforded
the
impassioned
and
yearning
farmer
a
pretext
for
inquiring
directly
after
possibly
in
the
ninth
month
of
her
endeavouring
to
get
a
notion
of
her
state
of
mind
regarding
him
this
occurred
in
the
middle
of
the
haymaking
and
boldwood
contrived
to
be
near
liddy
who
was
assisting
in
the
fields
am
glad
to
see
you
out
of
doors
lydia
he
said
pleasantly
she
simpered
and
wondered
in
her
heart
why
he
should
speak
so
frankly
to
her
hope
mrs
troy
is
quite
well
after
her
long
absence
he
continued
in
a
manner
expressing
that
the
neighbour
could
scarcely
say
less
about
her
is
quite
well
cheerful
i
did
you
say
no
i
merely
said
she
was
you
all
her
affairs
of
them
troy
puts
much
confidence
in
you
lydia
and
very
wisely
do
sir
been
with
her
all
through
her
troubles
and
was
with
her
at
the
time
of
going
and
all
and
if
she
were
to
marry
again
i
expect
i
should
bide
with
promises
that
you
natural
said
the
strategic
lover
throbbing
throughout
him
at
the
presumption
which
words
appeared
to
his
darling
had
thought
of
promise
it
exactly
i
merely
judge
on
my
own
yes
i
understand
when
she
alludes
to
the
possibility
of
marrying
again
you
never
do
allude
to
it
sir
said
liddy
thinking
how
very
stupid
boldwood
was
getting
course
not
he
returned
hastily
his
hope
falling
again
take
quite
such
long
reaches
with
your
rake
and
quick
ones
are
best
well
perhaps
as
she
is
absolute
mistress
again
now
it
is
wise
of
her
to
resolve
never
to
give
up
her
mistress
did
certainly
once
say
though
not
seriously
that
she
supposed
she
might
marry
again
at
the
end
of
seven
years
from
last
year
if
she
cared
to
risk
coming
back
and
claiming
six
years
from
the
present
time
said
that
she
might
she
might
marry
at
once
in
every
reasonable
opinion
whatever
the
lawyers
may
say
to
the
you
been
to
ask
them
said
liddy
innocently
i
said
boldwood
growing
red
you
stay
here
a
minute
later
than
you
wish
so
oak
says
i
am
now
going
on
a
little
farther
he
went
away
vexed
with
himself
and
ashamed
of
having
for
this
one
time
in
his
life
done
anything
which
could
be
called
underhand
poor
boldwood
had
no
more
skill
in
finesse
than
a
and
he
was
uneasy
with
a
sense
of
having
made
himself
to
appear
stupid
and
what
was
worse
mean
but
he
had
after
all
lighted
upon
one
fact
by
way
of
repayment
it
was
a
singularly
fresh
and
fascinating
fact
and
though
not
without
its
sadness
it
was
pertinent
and
real
in
little
more
than
six
years
from
this
time
bathsheba
might
certainly
marry
him
there
was
something
definite
in
that
hope
for
admitting
that
there
might
have
been
no
deep
thought
in
her
words
to
liddy
about
marriage
they
showed
at
least
her
creed
on
the
matter
this
pleasant
notion
was
now
continually
in
his
mind
six
years
were
a
long
time
but
how
much
shorter
than
never
the
idea
he
had
for
so
long
been
obliged
to
endure
jacob
had
served
twice
seven
years
for
rachel
what
were
six
for
such
a
woman
as
this
he
tried
to
like
the
notion
of
waiting
for
her
better
than
that
of
winning
her
at
once
boldwood
felt
his
love
to
be
so
deep
and
strong
and
eternal
that
it
was
possible
she
had
never
yet
known
its
full
volume
and
this
patience
in
delay
would
afford
him
an
opportunity
of
giving
sweet
proof
on
the
point
he
would
annihilate
the
six
years
of
his
life
as
if
they
were
little
did
he
value
his
time
on
earth
beside
her
love
he
would
let
her
see
all
those
six
years
of
intangible
ethereal
courtship
how
little
care
he
had
for
anything
but
as
it
bore
upon
the
consummation
meanwhile
the
early
and
the
late
summer
brought
round
the
week
in
which
greenhill
fair
was
held
this
fair
was
frequently
attended
by
the
folk
of
weatherbury
chapter
l
the
sheep
touches
his
hand
greenhill
was
the
nijni
novgorod
of
south
wessex
and
the
busiest
merriest
noisiest
day
of
the
whole
statute
number
was
the
day
of
the
sheep
fair
this
yearly
gathering
was
upon
the
summit
of
a
hill
which
retained
in
good
preservation
the
remains
of
an
ancient
earthwork
consisting
of
a
huge
rampart
and
entrenchment
of
an
oval
form
encircling
the
top
of
the
hill
though
somewhat
broken
down
here
and
there
to
each
of
the
two
chief
openings
on
opposite
sides
a
winding
road
ascended
and
the
level
green
space
of
ten
or
fifteen
acres
enclosed
by
the
bank
was
the
site
of
the
fair
a
few
permanent
erections
dotted
the
spot
but
the
majority
of
visitors
patronized
canvas
alone
for
resting
and
feeding
under
during
the
time
of
their
sojourn
here
shepherds
who
attended
with
their
flocks
from
long
distances
started
from
home
two
or
three
days
or
even
a
week
before
the
fair
driving
their
charges
a
few
miles
each
more
than
ten
or
resting
them
at
night
in
hired
fields
by
the
wayside
at
previously
chosen
points
where
they
fed
having
fasted
since
morning
the
shepherd
of
each
flock
marched
behind
a
bundle
containing
his
kit
for
the
week
strapped
upon
his
shoulders
and
in
his
hand
his
crook
which
he
used
as
the
staff
of
his
pilgrimage
several
of
the
sheep
would
get
worn
and
lame
and
occasionally
a
lambing
occurred
on
the
road
to
meet
these
contingencies
there
was
frequently
provided
to
accompany
the
flocks
from
the
remoter
points
a
pony
and
waggon
into
which
the
weakly
ones
were
taken
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
the
weatherbury
farms
however
were
no
such
long
distance
from
the
hill
and
those
arrangements
were
not
necessary
in
their
case
but
the
large
united
flocks
of
bathsheba
and
farmer
boldwood
formed
a
valuable
and
imposing
multitude
which
demanded
much
attention
and
on
this
account
gabriel
in
addition
to
shepherd
and
cain
ball
accompanied
them
along
the
way
through
the
decayed
old
town
of
kingsbere
and
upward
to
the
plateau
george
the
dog
of
course
behind
them
when
the
autumn
sun
slanted
over
greenhill
this
morning
and
lighted
the
dewy
flat
upon
its
crest
nebulous
clouds
of
dust
were
to
be
seen
floating
between
the
pairs
of
hedges
which
streaked
the
wide
prospect
around
in
all
directions
these
gradually
converged
upon
the
base
of
the
hill
and
the
flocks
became
individually
visible
climbing
the
serpentine
ways
which
led
to
the
top
thus
in
a
slow
procession
they
entered
the
opening
to
which
the
roads
tended
multitude
after
multitude
horned
and
flocks
and
red
flocks
buff
flocks
and
brown
flocks
even
green
and
flocks
according
to
the
fancy
of
the
colourist
and
custom
of
the
farm
men
were
shouting
dogs
were
barking
with
greatest
animation
but
the
thronging
travellers
in
so
long
a
journey
had
grown
nearly
indifferent
to
such
terrors
though
they
still
bleated
piteously
at
the
unwontedness
of
their
experiences
a
tall
shepherd
rising
here
and
there
in
the
midst
of
them
like
a
gigantic
idol
amid
a
crowd
of
prostrate
devotees
the
great
mass
of
sheep
in
the
fair
consisted
of
south
downs
and
the
old
wessex
horned
breeds
to
the
latter
class
and
farmer
mainly
belonged
these
filed
in
about
nine
their
vermiculated
horns
lopping
gracefully
on
each
side
of
their
cheeks
in
geometrically
perfect
spirals
a
small
pink
and
white
ear
nestling
under
each
horn
before
and
behind
came
other
varieties
perfect
leopards
as
to
the
full
rich
substance
of
their
coats
and
only
lacking
the
spots
there
were
also
a
few
of
the
oxfordshire
breed
whose
wool
was
beginning
to
curl
like
a
flaxen
hair
though
surpassed
in
this
respect
by
the
effeminate
leicesters
which
were
in
turn
less
curly
than
the
cotswolds
but
the
most
picturesque
by
far
was
a
small
flock
of
exmoors
which
chanced
to
be
there
this
year
their
pied
faces
and
legs
dark
and
heavy
horns
tresses
of
wool
hanging
round
their
swarthy
foreheads
quite
relieved
the
monotony
of
the
flocks
in
that
quarter
all
these
bleating
panting
and
weary
thousands
had
entered
and
were
penned
before
the
morning
had
far
advanced
the
dog
belonging
to
each
flock
being
tied
to
the
corner
of
the
pen
containing
it
alleys
for
pedestrians
intersected
the
pens
which
soon
became
crowded
with
buyers
and
sellers
from
far
and
near
in
another
part
of
the
hill
an
altogether
different
scene
began
to
force
itself
upon
the
eye
towards
midday
a
circular
tent
of
exceptional
newness
and
size
was
in
course
of
erection
here
as
the
day
drew
on
the
flocks
began
to
change
hands
lightening
the
responsibilities
and
they
turned
their
attention
to
this
tent
and
inquired
of
a
man
at
work
there
whose
soul
seemed
concentrated
on
tying
a
bothering
knot
in
no
time
what
was
going
on
royal
hippodrome
performance
of
ride
to
york
and
the
death
of
black
bess
replied
the
man
promptly
without
turning
his
eyes
or
leaving
off
tying
as
soon
as
the
tent
was
completed
the
band
struck
up
highly
stimulating
harmonies
and
the
announcement
was
publicly
made
black
bess
standing
in
a
conspicuous
position
on
the
outside
as
a
living
proof
if
proof
were
wanted
of
the
truth
of
the
oracular
utterances
from
the
stage
over
which
the
people
were
to
enter
these
were
so
convinced
by
such
genuine
appeals
to
heart
and
understanding
both
that
they
soon
began
to
crowd
in
abundantly
among
the
foremost
being
visible
jan
coggan
and
joseph
poorgrass
who
were
holiday
keeping
here
the
great
ruffen
pushing
me
screamed
a
woman
in
front
of
jan
over
her
shoulder
at
him
when
the
rush
was
at
its
fiercest
can
i
help
pushing
ye
when
the
folk
behind
push
me
said
coggan
in
a
deprecating
tone
turning
his
head
towards
the
aforesaid
folk
as
far
as
he
could
without
turning
his
body
which
was
jammed
as
in
a
vice
there
was
a
silence
then
the
drums
and
trumpets
again
sent
forth
their
echoing
notes
the
crowd
was
again
ecstasied
and
gave
another
lurch
in
which
coggan
and
poorgrass
were
again
thrust
by
those
behind
upon
the
women
in
front
that
helpless
feymels
should
be
at
the
mercy
of
such
ruffens
exclaimed
one
of
these
ladies
again
as
she
swayed
like
a
reed
shaken
by
the
wind
said
coggan
appealing
in
an
earnest
voice
to
the
public
at
large
as
it
stood
clustered
about
his
ye
ever
hear
such
onreasonable
woman
as
that
upon
my
carcase
neighbours
if
i
could
only
get
out
of
this
the
damn
women
might
eat
the
show
for

ye
lose
yer
temper
jan
implored
joseph
poorgrass
in
a
whisper
might
get
their
men
to
murder
us
for

think
by
the
shine
of
their
eyes
that
they
be
a
sinful
form
of
jan
held
his
tongue
as
if
he
had
no
objection
to
be
pacified
to
please
a
friend
and
they
gradually
reached
the
foot
of
the
ladder
poorgrass
being
flattened
like
a
and
the
sixpence
for
admission
which
he
had
got
ready
earlier
having
become
so
reeking
hot
in
the
tight
squeeze
of
his
excited
hand
that
the
woman
in
spangles
brazen
rings
set
with
glass
diamonds
and
with
chalked
face
and
shoulders
who
took
the
money
of
him
hastily
dropped
it
again
from
a
fear
that
some
trick
had
been
played
to
burn
her
fingers
so
they
all
entered
and
the
cloth
of
the
tent
to
the
eyes
of
an
observer
on
the
outside
became
bulged
into
innumerable
pimples
such
as
we
observe
on
a
sack
of
potatoes
caused
by
the
various
human
heads
backs
and
elbows
at
high
pressure
within
at
the
rear
of
the
large
tent
there
were
two
small
one
of
these
alloted
to
the
male
performers
was
partitioned
into
halves
by
a
cloth
and
in
one
of
the
divisions
there
was
sitting
on
the
grass
pulling
on
a
pair
of
a
young
man
whom
we
instantly
recognise
as
sergeant
troy
appearance
in
this
position
may
be
briefly
accounted
for
the
brig
aboard
which
he
was
taken
in
budmouth
roads
was
about
to
start
on
a
voyage
though
somewhat
short
of
hands
troy
read
the
articles
and
joined
but
before
they
sailed
a
boat
was
despatched
across
the
bay
to
lulwind
cove
as
he
had
half
expected
his
clothes
were
gone
he
ultimately
worked
his
passage
to
the
united
states
where
he
made
a
precarious
living
in
various
towns
as
professor
of
gymnastics
sword
exercise
fencing
and
pugilism
a
few
months
were
sufficient
to
give
him
a
distaste
for
this
kind
of
life
there
was
a
certain
animal
form
of
refinement
in
his
nature
and
however
pleasant
a
strange
condition
might
be
whilst
privations
were
easily
warded
off
it
was
disadvantageously
coarse
when
money
was
short
there
was
ever
present
too
the
idea
that
he
could
claim
a
home
and
its
comforts
did
he
but
chose
to
return
to
england
and
weatherbury
farm
whether
bathsheba
thought
him
dead
was
a
frequent
subject
of
curious
conjecture
to
england
he
did
return
at
last
but
the
fact
of
drawing
nearer
to
weatherbury
abstracted
its
fascinations
and
his
intention
to
enter
his
old
groove
at
the
place
became
modified
it
was
with
gloom
he
considered
on
landing
at
liverpool
that
if
he
were
to
go
home
his
reception
would
be
of
a
kind
very
unpleasant
to
contemplate
for
what
troy
had
in
the
way
of
emotion
was
an
occasional
fitful
sentiment
which
sometimes
caused
him
as
much
inconvenience
as
emotion
of
a
strong
and
healthy
kind
bathsheba
was
not
a
woman
to
be
made
a
fool
of
or
a
woman
to
suffer
in
silence
and
how
could
he
endure
existence
with
a
spirited
wife
to
whom
at
first
entering
he
would
be
beholden
for
food
and
lodging
moreover
it
was
not
at
all
unlikely
that
his
wife
would
fail
at
her
farming
if
she
had
not
already
done
so
and
he
would
then
become
liable
for
her
maintenance
and
what
a
life
such
a
future
of
poverty
with
her
would
be
the
spectre
of
fanny
constantly
between
them
harrowing
his
temper
and
embittering
her
words
thus
for
reasons
touching
on
distaste
regret
and
shame
commingled
he
put
off
his
return
from
day
to
day
and
would
have
decided
to
put
it
off
altogether
if
he
could
have
found
anywhere
else
the
establishment
which
existed
for
him
there
at
this
july
preceding
the
september
in
which
we
find
at
greenhill
fell
in
with
a
travelling
circus
which
was
performing
in
the
outskirts
of
a
northern
town
troy
introduced
himself
to
the
manager
by
taming
a
restive
horse
of
the
troupe
hitting
a
suspended
apple
with
a
fired
from
the
back
when
in
full
gallop
and
other
feats
for
his
merits
in
more
or
less
based
upon
his
experiences
as
a
was
taken
into
the
company
and
the
play
of
turpin
was
prepared
with
a
view
to
his
personation
of
the
chief
character
troy
was
not
greatly
elated
by
the
appreciative
spirit
in
which
he
was
undoubtedly
treated
but
he
thought
the
engagement
might
afford
him
a
few
weeks
for
consideration
it
was
thus
carelessly
and
without
having
formed
any
definite
plan
for
the
future
that
troy
found
himself
at
greenhill
fair
with
the
rest
of
the
company
on
this
day
and
now
the
mild
autumn
sun
got
lower
and
in
front
of
the
pavilion
the
following
incident
had
taken
place
was
driven
to
the
fair
that
day
by
her
odd
man
like
every
one
else
read
or
heard
the
announcement
that
francis
the
great
cosmopolitan
equestrian
and
roughrider
would
enact
the
part
of
turpin
and
she
was
not
yet
too
old
and
careworn
to
be
without
a
little
curiosity
to
see
him
this
particular
show
was
by
far
the
largest
and
grandest
in
the
fair
a
horde
of
little
shows
grouping
themselves
under
its
shade
like
chickens
around
a
hen
the
crowd
had
passed
in
and
boldwood
who
had
been
watching
all
the
day
for
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
seeing
her
comparatively
isolated
came
up
to
her
side
hope
the
sheep
have
done
well
mrs
troy
he
said
nervously
yes
thank
you
said
bathsheba
colour
springing
up
in
the
centre
of
her
cheeks
was
fortunate
enough
to
sell
them
all
just
as
we
got
upon
the
hill
so
we
to
pen
at
now
you
are
entirely
at
leisure
except
that
i
have
to
see
one
more
dealer
in
two
time
otherwise
i
should
be
going
home
he
was
looking
at
this
large
tent
and
the
announcement
have
you
ever
seen
the
play
of
ride
to
turpin
was
a
real
man
was
he
not
yes
perfectly
of
it
indeed
i
think
heard
jan
coggan
say
that
a
relation
of
his
knew
tom
king
friend
quite
is
rather
given
to
strange
stories
connected
with
his
relations
we
must
remember
i
hope
they
can
all
be
yes
we
know
coggan
but
turpin
is
true
enough
you
have
never
seen
it
played
i
suppose
i
was
not
allowed
to
go
into
these
places
when
i
was
young
hark
that
prancing
how
they
shout
bess
just
started
off
i
suppose
am
i
right
in
supposing
you
would
like
to
see
the
performance
mrs
troy
please
excuse
my
mistake
if
it
is
one
but
if
you
would
like
to
get
a
seat
for
you
with
perceiving
that
she
hesitated
he
added
myself
shall
not
stay
to
see
it
seen
it
now
bathsheba
did
care
a
little
to
see
the
show
and
had
only
withheld
her
feet
from
the
ladder
because
she
feared
to
go
in
alone
she
had
been
hoping
that
oak
might
appear
whose
assistance
in
such
cases
was
always
accepted
as
an
inalienable
right
but
oak
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
hence
it
was
that
she
said
if
you
will
just
look
in
first
to
see
if
room
i
think
i
will
go
in
for
a
minute
or
and
so
a
short
time
after
this
bathsheba
appeared
in
the
tent
with
boldwood
at
her
elbow
who
taking
her
to
a
seat
again
withdrew
this
feature
consisted
of
one
raised
bench
in
a
very
conspicuous
part
of
the
circle
covered
with
red
cloth
and
floored
with
a
piece
of
carpet
and
bathsheba
immediately
found
to
her
confusion
that
she
was
the
single
reserved
individual
in
the
tent
the
rest
of
the
crowded
spectators
one
and
all
standing
on
their
legs
on
the
borders
of
the
arena
where
they
got
twice
as
good
a
view
of
the
performance
for
half
the
money
hence
as
many
eyes
were
turned
upon
her
enthroned
alone
in
this
place
of
honour
against
a
scarlet
background
as
upon
the
ponies
and
clown
who
were
engaged
in
preliminary
exploits
in
the
centre
turpin
not
having
yet
appeared
once
there
bathsheba
was
forced
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
remain
she
sat
down
spreading
her
skirts
with
some
dignity
over
the
unoccupied
space
on
each
side
of
her
and
giving
a
new
and
feminine
aspect
to
the
pavilion
in
a
few
minutes
she
noticed
the
fat
red
nape
of
neck
among
those
standing
just
below
her
and
joseph
saintly
profile
a
little
further
on
the
interior
was
shadowy
with
a
peculiar
shade
the
strange
luminous
of
fine
autumn
afternoons
and
eves
intensified
into
rembrandt
effects
the
few
yellow
sunbeams
which
came
through
holes
and
divisions
in
the
canvas
and
spirted
like
jets
of
across
the
dusky
blue
atmosphere
of
haze
pervading
the
tent
until
they
alighted
on
inner
surfaces
of
cloth
opposite
and
shone
like
little
lamps
suspended
there
troy
on
peeping
from
his
through
a
slit
for
a
reconnoitre
before
entering
saw
his
unconscious
wife
on
high
before
him
as
described
sitting
as
queen
of
the
tournament
he
started
back
in
utter
confusion
for
although
his
disguise
effectually
concealed
his
personality
he
instantly
felt
that
she
would
be
sure
to
recognize
his
voice
he
had
several
times
during
the
day
thought
of
the
possibility
of
some
weatherbury
person
or
other
appearing
and
recognizing
him
but
he
had
taken
the
risk
carelessly
if
they
see
me
let
them
he
had
said
but
here
was
bathsheba
in
her
own
person
and
the
reality
of
the
scene
was
so
much
intenser
than
any
of
his
prefigurings
that
he
felt
he
had
not
half
enough
considered
the
point
she
looked
so
charming
and
fair
that
his
cool
mood
about
weatherbury
people
was
changed
he
had
not
expected
her
to
exercise
this
power
over
him
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
should
he
go
on
and
care
nothing
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
that
beyond
a
politic
wish
to
remain
unknown
there
suddenly
arose
in
him
now
a
sense
of
shame
at
the
possibility
that
his
attractive
young
wife
who
already
despised
him
should
despise
him
more
by
discovering
him
in
so
mean
a
condition
after
so
long
a
time
he
actually
blushed
at
the
thought
and
was
vexed
beyond
measure
that
his
sentiments
of
dislike
towards
weatherbury
should
have
led
him
to
dally
about
the
country
in
this
way
but
troy
was
never
more
clever
than
when
absolutely
at
his
end
he
hastily
thrust
aside
the
curtain
dividing
his
own
little
dressing
space
from
that
of
the
manager
and
proprietor
who
now
appeared
as
the
individual
called
tom
king
as
far
down
as
his
waist
and
as
the
aforesaid
respectable
manager
thence
to
his
toes
the
devil
to
pay
said
troy
that
a
blackguard
creditor
in
the
tent
i
want
to
see
discover
me
and
nab
me
as
sure
as
satan
if
i
open
my
mouth
to
be
done
must
appear
now
i
the
play
must
you
give
out
that
turpin
has
got
a
bad
cold
and
speak
his
part
but
that
perform
it
just
the
same
without
the
proprietor
shook
his
head
play
or
no
play
i
open
my
mouth
said
troy
firmly
well
then
let
me
see
i
tell
you
how
manage
said
the
other
who
perhaps
felt
it
would
be
extremely
awkward
to
offend
his
leading
man
just
at
this
time
tell
anything
about
your
keeping
silence
go
on
with
the
piece
and
say
nothing
doing
what
you
can
by
a
judicious
wink
now
and
then
and
a
few
indomitable
nods
in
the
heroic
places
you
know
never
find
out
that
the
speeches
are
this
seemed
feasible
enough
for
speeches
were
not
many
or
long
the
fascination
of
the
piece
lying
entirely
in
the
action
and
accordingly
the
play
began
and
at
the
appointed
time
black
bess
leapt
into
the
grassy
circle
amid
the
plaudits
of
the
spectators
at
the
turnpike
scene
where
bess
and
turpin
are
hotly
pursued
at
midnight
by
the
officers
and
the
gatekeeper
in
his
tasselled
nightcap
denies
that
any
horseman
has
passed
coggan
uttered
a
done
which
could
be
heard
all
over
the
fair
above
the
bleating
and
poorgrass
smiled
delightedly
with
a
nice
sense
of
dramatic
contrast
between
our
hero
who
coolly
leaps
the
gate
and
halting
justice
in
the
form
of
his
enemies
who
must
needs
pull
up
cumbersomely
and
wait
to
be
let
through
at
the
death
of
tom
king
he
could
not
refrain
from
seizing
coggan
by
the
hand
and
whispering
with
tears
in
his
eyes
course
not
really
shot
seemingly
and
when
the
last
sad
scene
came
on
and
the
body
of
the
gallant
and
faithful
bess
had
to
be
carried
out
on
a
shutter
by
twelve
volunteers
from
among
the
spectators
nothing
could
restrain
poorgrass
from
lending
a
hand
exclaiming
as
he
asked
jan
to
join
him
be
something
to
tell
of
at
in
future
years
jan
and
hand
down
to
our
for
many
a
year
in
weatherbury
joseph
told
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
had
experiences
in
his
time
that
he
touched
with
his
own
hand
the
hoof
of
bess
as
she
lay
upon
the
board
upon
his
shoulder
if
as
some
thinkers
hold
immortality
consists
in
being
enshrined
in
memories
then
did
black
bess
become
immortal
that
day
if
she
never
had
done
so
before
meanwhile
troy
had
added
a
few
touches
to
his
ordinary
for
the
character
the
more
effectually
to
disguise
himself
and
though
he
had
felt
faint
qualms
on
first
entering
the
metamorphosis
effected
by
judiciously
his
face
with
a
wire
rendered
him
safe
from
the
eyes
of
bathsheba
and
her
men
nevertheless
he
was
relieved
when
it
was
got
through
there
was
a
second
performance
in
the
evening
and
the
tent
was
lighted
up
troy
had
taken
his
part
very
quietly
this
time
venturing
to
introduce
a
few
speeches
on
occasion
and
was
just
concluding
it
when
whilst
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
circle
contiguous
to
the
first
row
of
spectators
he
observed
within
a
yard
of
him
the
eye
of
a
man
darted
keenly
into
his
side
features
troy
hastily
shifted
his
position
after
having
recognized
in
the
scrutineer
the
knavish
bailiff
pennyways
his
sworn
enemy
who
still
hung
about
the
outskirts
of
weatherbury
at
first
troy
resolved
to
take
no
notice
and
abide
by
circumstances
that
he
had
been
recognized
by
this
man
was
highly
probable
yet
there
was
room
for
a
doubt
then
the
great
objection
he
had
felt
to
allowing
news
of
his
proximity
to
precede
him
to
weatherbury
in
the
event
of
his
return
based
on
a
feeling
that
knowledge
of
his
present
occupation
would
discredit
him
still
further
in
his
eyes
returned
in
full
force
moreover
should
he
resolve
not
to
return
at
all
a
tale
of
his
being
alive
and
being
in
the
neighbourhood
would
be
awkward
and
he
was
anxious
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
his
temporal
affairs
before
deciding
which
to
do
in
this
dilemma
troy
at
once
went
out
to
reconnoitre
it
occurred
to
him
that
to
find
pennyways
and
make
a
friend
of
him
if
possible
would
be
a
very
wise
act
he
had
put
on
a
thick
beard
borrowed
from
the
establishment
and
in
this
he
wandered
about
the
it
was
now
almost
dark
and
respectable
people
were
getting
their
carts
and
gigs
ready
to
go
home
the
largest
refreshment
booth
in
the
fair
was
provided
by
an
innkeeper
from
a
neighbouring
town
this
was
considered
an
unexceptionable
place
for
obtaining
the
necessary
food
and
rest
host
trencher
as
he
was
jauntily
called
by
the
local
newspaper
being
a
substantial
man
of
high
repute
for
catering
through
all
the
country
round
the
tent
was
divided
into
first
and
compartments
and
at
the
end
of
the
division
was
a
yet
further
enclosure
for
the
most
exclusive
fenced
off
from
the
body
of
the
tent
by
a
behind
which
the
host
himself
stood
bustling
about
in
white
apron
and
and
looking
as
if
he
had
never
lived
anywhere
but
under
canvas
all
his
life
in
these
penetralia
were
chairs
and
a
table
which
on
candles
being
lighted
made
quite
a
cozy
and
luxurious
show
with
an
urn
plated
tea
and
coffee
pots
china
teacups
and
plum
cakes
troy
stood
at
the
entrance
to
the
booth
where
a
was
frying
pancakes
over
a
little
fire
of
sticks
and
selling
them
at
a
penny
and
looked
over
the
heads
of
the
people
within
he
could
see
nothing
of
pennyways
but
he
soon
discerned
bathsheba
through
an
opening
into
the
reserved
space
at
the
further
end
troy
thereupon
retreated
went
round
the
tent
into
the
darkness
and
listened
he
could
hear
voice
immediately
inside
the
canvas
she
was
conversing
with
a
man
a
warmth
overspread
his
face
surely
she
was
not
so
unprincipled
as
to
flirt
in
a
fair
he
wondered
if
then
she
reckoned
upon
his
death
as
an
absolute
certainty
to
get
at
the
root
of
the
matter
troy
took
a
penknife
from
his
pocket
and
softly
made
two
little
cuts
crosswise
in
the
cloth
which
by
folding
back
the
corners
left
a
hole
the
size
of
a
wafer
close
to
this
he
placed
his
face
withdrawing
it
again
in
a
movement
of
surprise
for
his
eye
had
been
within
twelve
inches
of
the
top
of
head
it
was
too
near
to
be
convenient
he
made
another
hole
a
little
to
one
side
and
lower
down
in
a
shaded
place
beside
her
chair
from
which
it
was
easy
and
safe
to
survey
her
by
looking
horizontally
troy
took
in
the
scene
completely
now
she
was
leaning
back
sipping
a
cup
of
tea
that
she
held
in
her
hand
and
the
owner
of
the
male
voice
was
boldwood
who
had
apparently
just
brought
the
cup
to
her
bathsheba
being
in
a
negligent
mood
leant
so
idly
against
the
canvas
that
it
was
pressed
to
the
shape
of
her
shoulder
and
she
was
in
fact
as
good
as
in
arms
and
he
was
obliged
to
keep
his
breast
carefully
backward
that
she
might
not
feel
its
warmth
through
the
cloth
as
he
gazed
in
troy
found
unexpected
chords
of
feeling
to
be
stirred
again
within
him
as
they
had
been
stirred
earlier
in
the
day
she
was
handsome
as
ever
and
she
was
his
it
was
some
minutes
before
he
could
counteract
his
sudden
wish
to
go
in
and
claim
her
then
he
thought
how
the
proud
girl
who
had
always
looked
down
upon
him
even
whilst
it
was
to
love
him
would
hate
him
on
discovering
him
to
be
a
strolling
player
were
he
to
make
himself
known
that
chapter
of
his
life
must
at
all
risks
be
kept
for
ever
from
her
and
from
the
weatherbury
people
or
his
name
would
be
a
byword
throughout
the
parish
he
would
be
nicknamed
as
long
as
he
lived
assuredly
before
he
could
claim
her
these
few
past
months
of
his
existence
must
be
entirely
blotted
out
i
get
you
another
cup
before
you
start
said
farmer
boldwood
you
said
bathsheba
i
must
be
going
at
once
it
was
great
neglect
in
that
man
to
keep
me
waiting
here
till
so
late
i
should
have
gone
two
hours
ago
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
i
had
no
idea
of
coming
in
here
but
nothing
so
refreshing
as
a
cup
of
tea
though
i
should
never
have
got
one
if
you
helped
troy
scrutinized
her
cheek
as
lit
by
the
candles
and
watched
each
varying
shade
thereon
and
the
white
sinuosities
of
her
little
ear
she
took
out
her
purse
and
was
insisting
to
boldwood
on
paying
for
her
tea
for
herself
when
at
this
moment
pennyways
entered
the
tent
troy
trembled
here
was
his
scheme
for
respectability
endangered
at
once
he
was
about
to
leave
his
hole
of
espial
attempt
to
follow
pennyways
and
find
out
if
the
had
recognized
him
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
conversation
and
found
he
was
too
late
me
said
pennyways
some
private
information
for
your
ear
can
not
hear
it
now
she
said
coldly
that
bathsheba
could
not
endure
this
man
was
evident
in
fact
he
was
continually
coming
to
her
with
some
tale
or
other
by
which
he
might
creep
into
favour
at
the
expense
of
persons
maligned
write
it
down
said
pennyways
confidently
he
stooped
over
the
table
pulled
a
leaf
from
a
warped
and
wrote
upon
the
paper
in
a
round
husband
is
here
seen
him
the
fool
now
this
he
folded
small
and
handed
towards
her
bathsheba
would
not
read
it
she
would
not
even
put
out
her
hand
to
take
it
pennyways
then
with
a
laugh
of
derision
tossed
it
into
her
lap
and
turning
away
left
her
from
the
words
and
action
of
pennyways
troy
though
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
what
the
wrote
had
not
a
doubt
that
the
note
referred
to
him
nothing
that
he
could
think
of
could
be
done
to
check
the
exposure
my
luck
he
whispered
and
added
imprecations
which
rustled
in
the
gloom
like
a
pestilent
wind
meanwhile
boldwood
said
taking
up
the
note
from
her
you
wish
to
read
it
mrs
troy
if
not
destroy
well
said
bathsheba
carelessly
it
is
unjust
not
to
read
it
but
i
can
guess
what
it
is
about
he
wants
me
to
recommend
him
or
it
is
to
tell
me
of
some
little
scandal
or
another
connected
with
my
always
doing
bathsheba
held
the
note
in
her
right
hand
boldwood
handed
towards
her
a
plate
of
cut
when
in
order
to
take
a
slice
she
put
the
note
into
her
left
hand
where
she
was
still
holding
the
purse
and
then
allowed
her
hand
to
drop
beside
her
close
to
the
canvas
the
moment
had
come
for
saving
his
game
and
troy
impulsively
felt
that
he
would
play
the
card
for
yet
another
time
he
looked
at
the
fair
hand
and
saw
the
pink
and
the
blue
veins
of
the
wrist
encircled
by
a
bracelet
of
coral
chippings
which
she
wore
how
familiar
it
all
was
to
him
then
with
the
lightning
action
in
which
he
was
such
an
adept
he
noiselessly
slipped
his
hand
under
the
bottom
of
the
which
was
far
from
being
pinned
tightly
down
lifted
it
a
little
way
keeping
his
eye
to
the
hole
snatched
the
note
from
her
fingers
dropped
the
canvas
and
ran
away
in
the
gloom
towards
the
bank
and
ditch
smiling
at
the
scream
of
astonishment
which
burst
from
her
troy
then
slid
down
on
the
outside
of
the
rampart
hastened
round
in
the
bottom
of
the
entrenchment
to
a
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
ascended
again
and
crossed
boldly
in
a
slow
walk
towards
the
front
entrance
of
the
tent
his
object
was
now
to
get
to
pennyways
and
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
announcement
until
such
time
as
he
should
choose
troy
reached
the
tent
door
and
standing
among
the
groups
there
gathered
looked
anxiously
for
pennyways
evidently
not
wishing
to
make
himself
prominent
by
inquiring
for
him
one
or
two
men
were
speaking
of
a
daring
attempt
that
had
just
been
made
to
rob
a
young
lady
by
lifting
the
canvas
of
the
tent
beside
her
it
was
supposed
that
the
rogue
had
imagined
a
slip
of
paper
which
she
held
in
her
hand
to
be
a
bank
note
for
he
had
seized
it
and
made
off
with
it
leaving
her
purse
behind
his
chagrin
and
disappointment
at
discovering
its
worthlessness
would
be
a
good
joke
it
was
said
however
the
occurrence
seemed
to
have
become
known
to
few
for
it
had
not
interrupted
a
fiddler
who
had
lately
begun
playing
by
the
door
of
the
tent
nor
the
four
bowed
old
men
with
grim
countenances
and
in
hand
who
were
dancing
to
the
tune
behind
these
stood
pennyways
troy
glided
up
to
him
beckoned
and
whispered
a
few
words
and
with
a
mutual
glance
of
concurrence
the
two
men
went
into
the
night
together
chapter
li
bathsheba
talks
with
her
outrider
the
arrangement
for
getting
back
again
to
weatherbury
had
been
that
oak
should
take
the
place
of
poorgrass
in
conveyance
and
drive
her
home
it
being
discovered
late
in
the
afternoon
that
joseph
was
suffering
from
his
old
complaint
a
multiplying
eye
and
was
therefore
hardly
trustworthy
as
coachman
and
protector
to
a
woman
but
oak
had
found
himself
so
occupied
and
was
full
of
so
many
cares
relative
to
those
portions
of
flocks
that
were
not
disposed
of
that
bathsheba
without
telling
oak
or
anybody
resolved
to
drive
home
herself
as
she
had
many
times
done
from
casterbridge
market
and
trust
to
her
good
angel
for
performing
the
journey
unmolested
but
having
fallen
in
with
farmer
boldwood
accidentally
on
her
part
at
least
at
the
she
found
it
impossible
to
refuse
his
offer
to
ride
on
horseback
beside
her
as
escort
it
had
grown
twilight
before
she
was
aware
but
boldwood
assured
her
that
there
was
no
cause
for
uneasiness
as
the
moon
would
be
up
in
immediately
after
the
incident
in
the
tent
she
had
risen
to
absolutely
alarmed
and
really
grateful
for
her
old
regretting
absence
whose
company
she
would
have
much
preferred
as
being
more
proper
as
well
as
more
pleasant
since
he
was
her
own
and
servant
this
however
could
not
be
helped
she
would
not
on
any
consideration
treat
boldwood
harshly
having
once
already
him
and
the
moon
having
risen
and
the
gig
being
ready
she
drove
across
the
hilltop
in
the
wending
which
led
oblivious
obscurity
as
it
seemed
for
the
moon
and
the
hill
it
flooded
with
light
were
in
appearance
on
a
level
the
rest
of
the
world
lying
as
a
vast
shady
concave
between
them
boldwood
mounted
his
horse
and
followed
in
close
attendance
behind
thus
they
descended
into
the
lowlands
and
the
sounds
of
those
left
on
the
hill
came
like
voices
from
the
sky
and
the
lights
were
as
those
of
a
camp
in
heaven
they
soon
passed
the
merry
stragglers
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
hill
traversed
kingsbere
and
got
upon
the
high
road
the
keen
instincts
of
bathsheba
had
perceived
that
the
staunch
devotion
to
herself
was
still
undiminished
and
she
sympathized
deeply
the
sight
had
quite
depressed
her
this
evening
had
reminded
her
of
her
folly
she
wished
anew
as
she
had
wished
many
months
ago
for
some
means
of
making
reparation
for
her
fault
hence
her
pity
for
the
man
who
so
persistently
loved
on
to
his
own
injury
and
permanent
gloom
had
betrayed
bathsheba
into
an
injudicious
considerateness
of
manner
which
appeared
almost
like
tenderness
and
gave
new
vigour
to
the
exquisite
dream
of
a
seven
years
service
in
poor
mind
he
soon
found
an
excuse
for
advancing
from
his
position
in
the
rear
and
rode
close
by
her
side
they
had
gone
two
or
three
miles
in
the
moonlight
speaking
desultorily
across
the
wheel
of
her
gig
concerning
the
fair
farming
usefulness
to
them
both
and
other
indifferent
subjects
when
boldwood
said
suddenly
and
troy
you
will
marry
again
some
day
this
query
unmistakably
confused
her
and
it
was
not
till
a
minute
or
more
had
elapsed
that
she
said
have
not
seriously
thought
of
any
such
quite
understand
that
yet
your
late
husband
has
been
dead
nearly
one
year
forget
that
his
death
was
never
absolutely
proved
and
may
not
have
taken
place
so
that
i
may
not
be
really
a
widow
she
said
catching
at
the
straw
of
escape
that
the
fact
afforded
absolutely
proved
perhaps
but
it
was
proved
circumstantially
a
man
saw
him
drowning
too
no
reasonable
person
has
any
doubt
of
his
death
nor
have
you
i
should
have
none
now
or
i
should
have
acted
differently
she
said
gently
certainly
at
first
had
a
strange
unaccountable
feeling
that
he
could
not
have
perished
but
i
have
been
able
to
explain
that
in
several
ways
since
but
though
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
i
shall
see
him
no
more
i
am
far
from
thinking
of
marriage
with
another
i
should
be
very
contemptible
to
indulge
in
such
a
they
were
silent
now
awhile
and
having
struck
into
an
unfrequented
track
across
a
common
the
creaks
of
saddle
and
her
gig
springs
were
all
the
sounds
to
be
heard
boldwood
ended
the
pause
you
remember
when
i
carried
you
fainting
in
my
arms
into
the
arms
in
casterbridge
every
dog
has
his
day
that
was
know
it
all
she
said
hurriedly
for
one
shall
never
cease
regretting
that
events
so
fell
out
as
to
deny
you
to
too
am
very
sorry
she
said
and
then
checked
herself
mean
you
know
i
am
sorry
you
thought
have
always
this
dreary
pleasure
in
thinking
over
those
past
times
with
i
was
something
to
you
before
was
anything
and
that
you
belonged
to
me
but
of
course
nothing
you
never
liked
did
and
respected
you
you
now
do
you
mean
which
you
like
me
or
do
you
respect
me
least
i
can
not
tell
you
it
is
difficult
for
a
woman
to
define
her
feelings
in
language
which
is
chiefly
made
by
men
to
express
theirs
my
treatment
of
you
was
thoughtless
inexcusable
wicked
i
shall
eternally
regret
it
if
there
had
been
anything
i
could
have
done
to
make
amends
i
would
most
gladly
have
done
was
nothing
on
earth
i
so
longed
to
do
as
to
repair
the
error
but
that
was
not
blame
were
not
so
far
in
the
wrong
as
you
suppose
bathsheba
suppose
you
had
real
complete
proof
that
you
are
what
in
fact
you
you
repair
the
old
wrong
to
me
by
marrying
me
can
not
say
i
yet
at
any
you
might
at
some
future
time
of
your
life
yes
i
might
at
some
then
do
you
know
that
without
further
proof
of
any
kind
you
may
marry
again
in
about
six
years
from
the
to
objection
or
blame
yes
she
said
quickly
know
all
that
but
talk
of
or
six
may
we
all
be
by
that
time
will
soon
glide
by
and
it
will
seem
an
astonishingly
short
time
to
look
back
upon
when
they
are
less
than
to
look
forward
to
yes
i
have
found
that
in
my
own
listen
once
more
boldwood
pleaded
i
wait
that
time
will
you
marry
me
you
own
that
you
owe
me
that
be
your
way
of
making
you
want
to
be
the
wife
of
any
other
man
indeed
i
mean
that
i
like
to
talk
about
this
matter
now
perhaps
it
is
not
proper
and
i
ought
not
to
allow
it
let
us
drop
it
my
husband
may
be
living
as
i
course
drop
the
subject
if
you
wish
but
propriety
has
nothing
to
do
with
reasons
i
am
a
man
willing
to
protect
you
for
the
remainder
of
our
lives
on
your
side
at
least
there
is
no
passion
or
blamable
mine
perhaps
there
is
but
i
help
seeing
that
if
you
choose
from
a
feeling
of
pity
and
as
you
say
a
wish
to
make
amends
to
make
a
bargain
with
me
for
a
agreement
which
will
set
all
things
right
and
make
me
happy
late
though
it
may
is
no
fault
to
be
found
with
you
as
a
woman
i
the
first
place
beside
you
you
been
almost
mine
once
already
surely
you
can
say
to
me
as
much
as
this
you
will
have
me
back
again
should
circumstances
permit
now
pray
speak
o
bathsheba
is
only
a
little
if
you
marry
again
you
will
marry
me
his
tone
was
so
excited
that
she
almost
feared
him
at
this
moment
even
whilst
she
sympathized
it
was
a
simple
physical
weak
of
the
strong
there
was
no
emotional
aversion
or
inner
repugnance
she
said
with
some
distress
in
her
voice
for
she
remembered
vividly
his
outburst
on
the
yalbury
road
and
shrank
from
a
repetition
of
his
anger
will
never
marry
another
man
whilst
you
wish
me
to
be
your
wife
whatever
to
say
have
taken
me
so
by
let
it
stand
in
these
simple
in
six
time
you
will
be
my
wife
unexpected
accidents
not
mention
because
those
of
course
must
be
given
way
to
now
this
time
i
know
you
will
keep
your
why
i
hesitate
to
give
do
give
it
remember
the
past
and
be
she
breathed
and
then
said
mournfully
what
shall
i
do
i
love
you
and
i
much
fear
that
i
never
shall
love
you
as
much
as
a
woman
ought
to
love
a
husband
if
you
sir
know
that
and
i
can
yet
give
you
happiness
by
a
mere
promise
to
marry
at
the
end
of
six
years
if
my
husband
should
not
come
back
it
is
a
great
honour
to
me
and
if
you
value
such
an
act
of
friendship
from
a
woman
who
esteem
herself
as
she
did
and
has
little
love
left
why
if
i
can
not
promise
soon
is
perhaps
never
no
it
is
not
i
mean
soon
christmas
he
said
nothing
further
till
he
added
say
no
more
to
you
about
it
till
that
bathsheba
was
in
a
very
peculiar
state
of
mind
which
showed
how
entirely
the
soul
is
the
slave
of
the
body
the
ethereal
spirit
dependent
for
its
quality
upon
the
tangible
flesh
and
blood
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
she
felt
coerced
by
a
force
stronger
than
her
own
will
not
only
into
the
act
of
promising
upon
this
singularly
remote
and
vague
matter
but
into
the
emotion
of
fancying
that
she
ought
to
promise
when
the
weeks
intervening
between
the
night
of
this
conversation
and
christmas
day
began
perceptibly
to
diminish
her
anxiety
and
perplexity
increased
one
day
she
was
led
by
an
accident
into
an
oddly
confidential
dialogue
with
gabriel
about
her
difficulty
it
afforded
her
a
little
a
dull
and
cheerless
kind
they
were
auditing
accounts
and
something
occurred
in
the
course
of
their
labours
which
led
oak
to
say
speaking
of
boldwood
never
forget
you
then
out
came
her
trouble
before
she
was
aware
and
she
told
him
how
she
had
again
got
into
the
toils
what
boldwood
had
asked
her
and
how
he
was
expecting
her
assent
most
mournful
reason
of
all
for
my
agreeing
to
it
she
said
sadly
the
true
reason
why
i
think
to
do
so
for
good
or
for
evil
is
is
a
thing
i
have
not
breathed
to
a
living
soul
as
believe
that
if
i
give
my
word
go
out
of
his
do
ye
said
gabriel
gravely
believe
this
she
continued
with
reckless
frankness
heaven
knows
i
say
it
in
a
spirit
the
very
reverse
of
vain
for
i
am
grieved
and
troubled
to
my
soul
about
believe
i
hold
that
future
in
my
hand
his
career
depends
entirely
upon
my
treatment
of
him
o
gabriel
i
tremble
at
my
responsibility
for
it
is
terrible
i
think
this
much
as
i
told
you
years
ago
said
oak
his
life
is
a
total
blank
whenever
he
hoping
for
but
i
hope
that
nothing
so
dreadful
hangs
on
to
it
as
you
fancy
his
natural
manner
has
always
been
dark
and
strange
you
know
but
since
the
case
is
so
sad
and
why
ye
give
the
conditional
promise
i
think
i
is
it
right
some
rash
acts
of
my
past
life
have
taught
me
that
a
watched
woman
must
have
very
much
circumspection
to
retain
only
a
very
little
credit
and
i
do
want
and
long
to
be
discreet
in
this
and
six
we
may
all
be
in
our
graves
by
that
time
even
if
mr
troy
does
not
come
back
again
which
he
may
not
impossibly
do
such
thoughts
give
a
sort
of
absurdity
to
the
scheme
now
it
preposterous
gabriel
however
he
came
to
dream
of
it
i
can
not
think
but
is
it
wrong
you
are
older
than
years
older
eight
is
it
wrong
it
would
be
an
uncommon
agreement
for
a
man
and
woman
to
make
i
see
anything
really
wrong
about
it
said
oak
slowly
fact
the
very
thing
that
makes
it
doubtful
if
you
ought
to
marry
en
under
any
condition
that
is
your
not
caring
about
i
may
you
may
suppose
that
love
is
wanting
she
said
shortly
is
an
utterly
bygone
sorry
miserable
thing
with
him
or
any
one
your
want
of
love
seems
to
me
the
one
thing
that
takes
away
harm
from
such
an
agreement
with
him
if
wild
heat
had
to
do
it
making
ye
long
to
the
awkwardness
about
your
vanishing
it
mid
be
wrong
but
a
agreement
to
oblige
a
man
seems
different
somehow
the
real
sin
in
my
mind
lies
in
thinking
of
ever
wedding
a
man
you
love
honest
and
willing
to
pay
the
penalty
of
said
bathsheba
firmly
know
gabriel
this
is
what
i
can
not
get
off
my
i
once
seriously
injured
him
in
sheer
idleness
if
i
had
never
played
a
trick
upon
him
he
would
never
have
wanted
to
marry
me
oh
if
i
could
only
pay
some
heavy
damages
in
money
to
him
for
the
harm
i
did
and
so
get
the
sin
off
my
soul
that
way
well
the
debt
which
can
only
be
discharged
in
one
way
and
i
believe
i
am
bound
to
do
it
if
it
honestly
lies
in
my
power
without
any
consideration
of
my
own
future
at
all
when
a
rake
gambles
away
his
expectations
the
fact
that
it
is
an
inconvenient
debt
make
him
the
less
liable
been
a
rake
and
the
single
point
i
ask
you
is
considering
that
my
own
scruples
and
the
fact
that
in
the
eye
of
the
law
my
husband
is
only
missing
will
keep
any
man
from
marrying
me
until
seven
years
have
i
free
to
entertain
such
an
idea
even
though
a
sort
of
it
will
be
that
i
the
act
of
marriage
under
such
circumstances
and
the
class
of
women
i
should
seem
to
belong
to
by
doing
it
seems
to
me
that
all
depends
upon
you
think
as
everybody
else
do
that
your
husband
is
long
ceased
to
doubt
that
i
well
know
what
would
have
brought
him
back
long
before
this
time
if
he
had
then
in
a
religious
sense
you
will
be
as
free
to
marrying
again
as
any
real
widow
of
one
standing
but
why
ye
ask
advice
on
how
to
treat
boldwood
when
i
want
a
opinion
for
general
enlightenment
distinct
from
special
advice
i
never
go
to
a
man
who
deals
in
the
subject
professionally
so
i
like
the
opinion
on
law
the
on
doctoring
the
on
business
and
my
is
on
afraid
a
hitch
in
that
argument
said
oak
with
a
grave
smile
she
did
not
reply
at
once
and
then
saying
evening
oak
went
away
she
had
spoken
frankly
and
neither
asked
nor
expected
any
reply
from
gabriel
more
satisfactory
than
that
she
had
obtained
yet
in
the
centremost
parts
of
her
complicated
heart
there
existed
at
this
minute
a
little
pang
of
disappointment
for
a
reason
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
recognize
oak
had
not
once
wished
her
free
that
he
might
marry
her
not
once
said
could
wait
for
you
as
well
as
that
was
the
insect
sting
not
that
she
would
have
listened
to
any
such
hypothesis
o
she
saying
all
the
time
that
such
thoughts
of
the
future
were
improper
and
gabriel
far
too
poor
a
man
to
speak
sentiment
to
her
yet
he
might
have
just
hinted
about
that
old
love
of
his
and
asked
in
a
playful
way
if
he
might
speak
of
it
it
would
have
seemed
pretty
and
sweet
if
no
more
and
then
she
would
have
shown
how
kind
and
inoffensive
a
can
sometimes
be
but
to
give
such
cool
very
advice
she
had
asked
ruffled
our
heroine
all
the
afternoon
chapter
lii
converging
courses
i
came
and
a
party
that
boldwood
was
to
give
in
the
evening
was
the
great
subject
of
talk
in
weatherbury
it
was
not
that
the
rarity
of
christmas
parties
in
the
parish
made
this
one
a
wonder
but
that
boldwood
should
be
the
giver
the
announcement
had
had
an
abnormal
and
incongruous
sound
as
if
one
should
hear
of
in
a
cathedral
aisle
or
that
some
judge
was
going
upon
the
stage
that
the
party
was
intended
to
be
a
truly
jovial
one
there
was
no
room
for
doubt
a
large
bough
of
mistletoe
had
been
brought
from
the
woods
that
day
and
suspended
in
the
hall
of
the
home
holly
and
ivy
had
followed
in
armfuls
from
six
that
morning
till
past
noon
the
huge
wood
fire
in
the
kitchen
roared
and
sparkled
at
its
highest
the
kettle
the
saucepan
and
the
pot
appearing
in
the
midst
of
the
flames
like
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
moreover
roasting
and
basting
operations
were
continually
carried
on
in
front
of
the
genial
blaze
as
it
grew
later
the
fire
was
made
up
in
the
large
long
hall
into
which
the
staircase
descended
and
all
encumbrances
were
cleared
out
for
dancing
the
log
which
was
to
form
the
of
the
evening
fire
was
the
uncleft
trunk
of
a
tree
so
unwieldy
that
it
could
be
neither
brought
nor
rolled
to
its
place
and
accordingly
two
men
were
to
be
observed
dragging
and
heaving
it
in
by
chains
and
levers
as
the
hour
of
assembly
drew
near
in
spite
of
all
this
the
spirit
of
revelry
was
wanting
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
such
a
thing
had
never
been
attempted
before
by
its
owner
and
it
was
now
done
as
by
a
wrench
intended
gaieties
would
insist
upon
appearing
like
solemn
grandeurs
the
organization
of
the
whole
effort
was
carried
out
coldly
by
hirelings
and
a
shadow
seemed
to
move
about
the
rooms
saying
that
the
proceedings
were
unnatural
to
the
place
and
the
lone
man
who
lived
therein
and
hence
not
good
ii
bathsheba
was
at
this
time
in
her
room
dressing
for
the
event
she
had
called
for
candles
and
liddy
entered
and
placed
one
on
each
side
of
her
glass
go
away
liddy
said
bathsheba
almost
timidly
am
foolishly
can
not
tell
why
i
wish
i
had
not
been
obliged
to
go
to
this
dance
but
no
escaping
now
i
have
not
spoken
to
boldwood
since
the
autumn
when
i
promised
to
see
him
at
christmas
on
business
but
i
had
no
idea
there
was
to
be
anything
of
this
i
would
go
now
said
liddy
who
was
going
with
her
for
boldwood
had
been
indiscriminate
in
his
invitations
i
shall
make
my
appearance
of
course
said
bathsheba
i
am
of
the
party
and
that
upsets
me
tell
no
you
the
cause
of
it
i
am
the
reason
of
the
if
it
had
not
been
for
me
there
would
never
have
been
one
i
explain
any
no
more
to
be
explained
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
wicked
of
wish
to
be
worse
off
than
you
liddy
i
have
never
been
free
from
trouble
since
i
have
lived
here
and
this
party
is
likely
to
bring
me
more
now
fetch
my
black
silk
dress
and
see
how
it
sits
upon
you
will
leave
off
that
surely
you
have
been
a
fourteen
months
and
ought
to
brighten
up
a
little
on
such
a
night
as
it
necessary
no
i
will
appear
as
usual
for
if
i
were
to
wear
any
light
dress
people
would
say
things
about
me
and
i
should
seem
to
be
rejoicing
when
i
am
solemn
all
the
time
the
party
suit
me
a
bit
but
never
mind
stay
and
help
to
finish
me
iii
boldwood
was
dressing
also
at
this
hour
a
tailor
from
casterbridge
was
with
him
assisting
him
in
the
operation
of
trying
on
a
new
coat
that
had
just
been
brought
home
never
had
boldwood
been
so
fastidious
unreasonable
about
the
fit
and
generally
difficult
to
please
the
tailor
walked
round
and
round
him
tugged
at
the
waist
pulled
the
sleeve
pressed
out
the
collar
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
experience
boldwood
was
not
bored
times
had
been
when
the
farmer
had
exclaimed
against
all
such
niceties
as
childish
but
now
no
philosophic
or
hasty
rebuke
whatever
was
provoked
by
this
man
for
attaching
as
much
importance
to
a
crease
in
the
coat
as
to
an
earthquake
in
south
america
boldwood
at
last
expressed
himself
nearly
satisfied
and
paid
the
bill
the
tailor
passing
out
of
the
door
just
as
oak
came
in
to
report
progress
for
the
day
oak
said
boldwood
shall
of
course
see
you
here
make
yourself
merry
i
am
determined
that
neither
expense
nor
trouble
shall
be
try
to
be
here
sir
though
perhaps
it
may
not
be
very
early
said
gabriel
quietly
am
glad
indeed
to
see
such
a
change
in
from
what
it
used
to
must
own
am
bright
cheerful
and
more
than
much
so
that
i
am
almost
sad
again
with
the
sense
that
all
of
it
is
passing
away
and
sometimes
when
i
am
excessively
hopeful
and
blithe
a
trouble
is
looming
in
the
distance
so
that
i
often
get
to
look
upon
gloom
in
me
with
content
and
to
fear
a
happy
mood
still
this
may
be
feel
that
it
is
absurd
perhaps
my
day
is
dawning
at
hope
it
be
a
long
and
a
fair
you
yet
perhaps
my
cheerfulness
rests
on
a
slender
hope
and
yet
i
trust
my
hope
it
is
faith
not
hope
i
think
this
time
i
reckon
with
my
my
hands
are
a
little
shaky
or
something
i
tie
this
neckerchief
properly
perhaps
you
will
tie
it
for
me
the
fact
is
i
have
not
been
well
lately
you
am
sorry
to
hear
that
nothing
i
want
it
done
as
well
as
you
can
please
is
there
any
late
knot
in
fashion
oak
know
sir
said
oak
his
tone
had
sunk
to
sadness
boldwood
approached
gabriel
and
as
oak
tied
the
neckerchief
the
farmer
went
on
a
woman
keep
her
promise
gabriel
it
is
not
inconvenient
to
her
she
rather
an
implied
answer
for
her
implying
said
oak
with
faint
bitterness
a
word
as
full
holes
as
a
sieve
with
talk
like
that
you
have
got
quite
cynical
is
it
we
seem
to
have
shifted
our
positions
i
have
become
the
young
and
hopeful
man
and
you
the
old
and
unbelieving
one
however
does
a
woman
keep
a
promise
not
to
marry
but
to
enter
on
an
engagement
to
marry
at
some
time
now
you
know
women
better
than
am
afeard
you
honour
my
understanding
too
much
however
she
may
keep
such
a
promise
if
it
is
made
with
an
honest
meaning
to
repair
a
has
not
gone
far
yet
but
i
think
it
will
i
know
it
will
he
said
in
an
impulsive
whisper
have
pressed
her
upon
the
subject
and
she
inclines
to
be
kind
to
me
and
to
think
of
me
as
a
husband
at
a
long
future
time
and
enough
for
me
how
can
i
expect
more
she
has
a
notion
that
a
woman
should
not
marry
within
seven
years
of
her
her
own
self
i
his
body
was
not
found
it
may
be
merely
this
legal
reason
which
influences
her
or
it
may
be
a
religious
one
but
she
is
reluctant
to
talk
on
the
point
yet
she
has
she
will
ratify
an
engagement
years
murmured
oak
no
such
thing
he
said
with
impatience
years
nine
months
and
a
few
days
fifteen
months
nearly
have
passed
since
he
vanished
and
is
there
anything
so
wonderful
in
an
engagement
of
little
more
than
five
years
seems
long
in
a
forward
view
build
too
much
upon
such
promises
sir
remember
you
have
once
deceived
her
meaning
may
be
good
but
young
never
said
boldwood
vehemently
never
promised
me
at
that
first
time
and
hence
she
did
not
break
her
promise
if
she
promises
me
marry
me

troy
was
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
white
hart
tavern
at
casterbridge
smoking
and
drinking
a
steaming
mixture
from
a
glass
a
knock
was
given
at
the
door
and
pennyways
entered
have
you
seen
him
troy
inquired
pointing
to
a
chair
at
home
i
went
there
first
a
rather
i
i
see
that
because
a
man
appears
to
be
drowned
and
was
not
he
should
be
liable
for
anything
i
ask
any
not
it
exactly
if
a
man
changes
his
name
and
so
forth
and
takes
steps
to
deceive
the
world
and
his
own
wife
a
cheat
and
that
in
the
eye
of
the
law
is
ayless
a
rogue
and
that
is
ayless
a
lammocken
vagabond
and
a
punishable
well
done
pennyways
troy
had
laughed
but
it
was
with
some
anxiety
that
he
said
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
do
you
think
really
anything
going
on
between
her
and
boldwood
upon
my
soul
i
should
never
have
believed
it
how
she
must
detest
me
have
you
found
out
whether
she
has
encouraged
him
been
able
to
learn
a
deal
of
feeling
on
his
side
seemingly
but
i
answer
for
her
i
know
a
word
about
any
such
thing
till
yesterday
and
all
i
heard
then
was
that
she
was
gwine
to
the
party
at
his
house
this
is
the
first
time
she
has
ever
gone
there
they
say
and
they
say
that
not
so
much
as
spoke
to
him
since
they
were
at
greenhill
fair
but
what
can
folk
believe
however
not
fond
of
offish
and
quite
careless
i
not
so
sure
of
that
a
handsome
woman
pennyways
is
she
not
own
that
you
never
saw
a
finer
or
more
splendid
creature
in
your
life
upon
my
honour
when
i
set
eyes
upon
her
that
day
i
wondered
what
i
could
have
been
made
of
to
be
able
to
leave
her
by
herself
so
long
and
then
i
was
hampered
with
that
bothering
show
which
free
of
at
last
thank
the
he
smoked
on
awhile
and
then
added
did
she
look
when
you
passed
by
yesterday
she
took
no
great
heed
of
me
ye
may
well
fancy
but
she
looked
well
enough
i
know
just
flashed
her
haughty
eyes
upon
my
poor
scram
body
and
then
let
them
go
past
me
to
what
was
yond
much
as
if
been
no
more
than
a
leafless
tree
she
had
just
got
off
her
mare
to
look
at
the
last
of
cider
for
the
year
she
had
been
riding
and
so
her
colours
were
up
and
her
breath
rather
quick
so
that
her
bosom
plimmed
and
and
time
plain
to
my
eye
ay
and
there
were
the
fellers
round
her
wringing
down
the
cheese
and
bustling
about
and
saying
the
pommy
spoil
yer
mind
me
says
she
then
gabe
brought
her
some
of
the
new
cider
and
she
must
needs
go
drinking
it
through
a
strawmote
and
not
in
a
nateral
way
at
all
says
she
indoors
a
few
gallons
and
make
some
sergeant
i
was
no
more
to
her
than
a
morsel
of
scroff
in
the
must
go
and
find
her
out
at
yes
i
see
must
go
oak
is
head
man
still
he
and
at
little
weatherbury
farm
too
he
manages
puzzle
him
to
manage
her
or
any
other
man
of
his
compass
know
about
that
she
do
without
him
and
knowing
it
well
pretty
independent
and
a
few
soft
corners
to
her
mind
though
never
been
able
to
get
into
one
the
baily
a
notch
above
you
and
you
must
own
it
a
higher
class
of
finer
tissue
however
stick
to
me
and
neither
this
haughty
goddess
dashing
piece
of
womanhood
of
mine
juno
was
a
goddess
you
know
nor
anybody
else
shall
hurt
you
but
all
this
wants
looking
into
i
perceive
what
with
one
thing
and
another
i
see
that
my
work
is
well
cut
out
for
v
do
i
look
liddy
said
bathsheba
giving
a
final
adjustment
to
her
dress
before
leaving
the
glass
never
saw
you
look
so
well
before
tell
you
when
you
looked
like
night
a
year
and
a
half
ago
when
you
came
in
so
wildlike
and
scolded
us
for
making
remarks
about
you
and
will
think
that
i
am
setting
myself
to
captivate
boldwood
i
suppose
she
murmured
least
say
so
my
hair
be
brushed
down
a
little
flatter
i
dread
i
dread
the
risk
of
wounding
him
by
staying
you
well
be
dressed
plainer
than
you
are
unless
you
go
in
sackcloth
at
once
your
excitement
is
what
makes
you
look
so
noticeable
know
the
matter
i
feel
wretched
at
one
time
and
buoyant
at
another
i
wish
i
could
have
continued
quite
alone
as
i
have
been
for
the
last
year
or
so
with
no
hopes
and
no
fears
and
no
pleasure
and
no
just
suppose
boldwood
should
ask
just
suppose
run
away
with
him
what
would
you
do
of
that
said
bathsheba
gravely
i
hear
joking
on
any
such
matter
do
you
hear
beg
pardon
but
knowing
what
rum
things
we
women
be
i
just
i
speak
of
it
marrying
for
me
yet
for
many
a
year
if
ever
be
for
reasons
very
very
different
from
those
you
think
or
others
will
believe
now
get
my
cloak
for
it
is
time
to
vi
said
boldwood
you
go
i
want
to
mention
what
has
been
passing
in
my
mind
little
arrangement
we
made
about
your
share
in
the
farm
i
mean
that
share
is
small
too
small
considering
how
little
i
attend
to
business
now
and
how
much
time
and
thought
you
give
to
it
well
since
the
world
is
brightening
for
me
i
want
to
show
my
sense
of
it
by
increasing
your
proportion
in
the
partnership
make
a
memorandum
of
the
arrangement
which
struck
me
as
likely
to
be
convenient
for
i
time
to
talk
about
it
now
and
then
discuss
it
at
our
leisure
my
intention
is
ultimately
to
retire
from
the
management
altogether
and
until
you
can
take
all
the
expenditure
upon
your
shoulders
be
a
sleeping
partner
in
the
stock
then
if
i
marry
i
feel
i
shall
speak
of
it
sir
said
oak
hastily
know
what
may
happen
so
many
upsets
may
befall
many
a
slip
as
they
i
would
advise
know
pardon
me
this
to
be
know
i
know
but
the
feeling
i
have
about
increasing
your
share
is
on
account
of
what
i
know
of
you
oak
i
have
learnt
a
little
about
your
secret
your
interest
in
her
is
more
than
that
of
bailiff
for
an
employer
but
you
have
behaved
like
a
man
and
i
as
a
sort
of
successful
partly
through
your
goodness
of
like
definitely
to
show
my
sense
of
your
friendship
under
what
must
have
been
a
great
pain
to
not
necessary
thank
said
oak
hurriedly
must
get
used
to
such
as
that
other
men
have
and
so
shall
oak
then
left
him
he
was
uneasy
on
account
for
he
saw
anew
that
this
constant
passion
of
the
farmer
made
him
not
the
man
he
once
had
been
as
boldwood
continued
awhile
in
his
room
and
dressed
to
receive
his
mood
of
anxiety
about
his
appearance
seemed
to
pass
away
and
to
be
succeeded
by
a
deep
solemnity
he
looked
out
of
the
window
and
regarded
the
dim
outline
of
the
trees
upon
the
sky
and
the
twilight
deepening
to
darkness
then
he
went
to
a
locked
closet
and
took
from
a
locked
drawer
therein
a
small
circular
case
the
size
of
a
pillbox
and
was
about
to
put
it
into
his
pocket
but
he
lingered
to
open
the
cover
and
take
a
momentary
glance
inside
it
contained
a
set
all
the
way
round
with
small
diamonds
and
from
its
appearance
had
evidently
been
recently
purchased
eyes
dwelt
upon
its
many
sparkles
a
long
time
though
that
its
material
aspect
concerned
him
little
was
plain
from
his
manner
and
mien
which
were
those
of
a
mind
following
out
the
presumed
thread
of
that
future
history
the
noise
of
wheels
at
the
front
of
the
house
became
audible
boldwood
closed
the
box
stowed
it
away
carefully
in
his
pocket
and
went
out
upon
the
landing
the
old
man
who
was
his
indoor
factotum
came
at
the
same
moment
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
be
coming
of
and
was
coming
down
this
moment
those
wheels
i
it
mrs
troy
not
she
a
reserved
and
sombre
expression
had
returned
to
face
again
but
it
poorly
cloaked
his
feelings
when
he
pronounced
name
and
his
feverish
anxiety
continued
to
show
its
existence
by
a
galloping
motion
of
his
fingers
upon
the
side
of
his
thigh
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
vii
does
this
cover
me
said
troy
to
pennyways
would
recognize
me
now
he
was
buttoning
on
a
heavy
grey
overcoat
of
noachian
cut
with
cape
and
high
collar
the
latter
being
erect
and
rigid
like
a
girdling
wall
and
nearly
reaching
to
the
verge
of
a
travelling
cap
which
was
pulled
down
over
his
ears
pennyways
snuffed
the
candle
and
then
looked
up
and
deliberately
inspected
troy
made
up
your
mind
to
go
then
he
said
up
my
mind
yes
of
course
i
not
write
to
her
a
very
queer
corner
that
you
have
got
into
sergeant
you
see
all
these
things
will
come
to
light
if
you
go
back
and
they
sound
well
at
all
faith
if
i
was
you
even
bide
as
you
single
man
of
the
name
of
francis
a
good
wife
is
good
but
the
best
wife
is
not
so
good
as
no
wife
at
all
now
my
outspoke
mind
and
been
called
a
feller
here
and
nonsense
said
troy
angrily
she
is
with
plenty
of
money
and
a
house
and
farm
and
horses
and
comfort
and
here
am
i
living
from
hand
to
needy
adventurer
besides
it
is
no
use
talking
now
it
is
too
late
and
i
am
glad
of
it
been
seen
and
recognized
here
this
very
afternoon
i
should
have
gone
back
to
her
the
day
after
the
fair
if
it
been
for
you
talking
about
the
law
and
rubbish
about
getting
a
separation
and
i
put
it
off
any
longer
what
the
deuce
put
it
into
my
head
to
run
away
at
all
i
think
humbugging
what
it
was
but
what
man
on
earth
was
to
know
that
his
wife
would
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
rid
of
his
name
should
have
known
it
bad
enough
for
mind
who
you
are
talking
sergeant
all
i
say
is
this
that
if
i
were
you
go
abroad
again
where
i
came
too
late
to
do
it
now
i
stir
up
the
business
and
get
a
bad
name
for
the
sake
of
living
with
all
that
about
your
is
sure
to
come
out
you
know
although
you
think
otherwise
my
eyes
and
limbs
be
a
racket
if
you
go
back
just
the
middle
of
christmasing
yes
i
expect
i
shall
not
be
a
very
welcome
guest
if
he
has
her
there
said
the
sergeant
with
a
slight
laugh
sort
of
alonzo
the
brave
and
when
i
go
in
the
guests
will
sit
in
silence
and
fear
and
all
laughter
and
pleasure
will
be
hushed
and
the
lights
in
the
chamber
burn
blue
and
the
horrible
for
some
more
brandy
pennyways
i
felt
an
awful
shudder
just
then
well
what
is
there
besides
a
must
have
a
pennyways
now
felt
himself
to
be
in
something
of
a
difficulty
for
should
bathsheba
and
troy
become
reconciled
it
would
be
necessary
to
regain
her
good
opinion
if
he
would
secure
the
patronage
of
her
husband
sometimes
think
she
likes
you
yet
and
is
a
good
woman
at
bottom
he
said
as
a
saving
sentence
no
telling
to
a
certainty
from
a
outside
well
do
as
you
like
about
going
of
course
sergeant
and
as
for
me
do
as
you
tell
let
me
see
what
the
time
is
said
troy
after
emptying
his
glass
in
one
draught
as
he
stood
six
i
shall
not
hurry
along
the
road
and
shall
be
there
then
before
chapter
liii
momento
outside
the
front
of
house
a
group
of
men
stood
in
the
dark
with
their
faces
towards
the
door
which
occasionally
opened
and
closed
for
the
passage
of
some
guest
or
servant
when
a
golden
rod
of
light
would
stripe
the
ground
for
the
moment
and
vanish
again
leaving
nothing
outside
but
the
glowworm
shine
of
the
pale
lamp
amid
the
evergreens
over
the
door
was
seen
in
casterbridge
this
the
boy
said
one
of
them
remarked
in
a
whisper
i
for
one
believe
it
his
body
was
never
found
you
a
strange
story
said
the
next
may
depend
that
she
knows
nothing
about
a
he
mean
that
she
shall
said
another
man
alive
and
here
in
the
neighbourhood
he
means
mischief
said
the
first
young
thing
i
do
pity
her
if
true
drag
her
to
the
no
settle
down
quiet
enough
said
one
disposed
to
take
a
more
hopeful
view
of
the
case
a
fool
she
must
have
been
ever
to
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
man
she
is
so
and
independent
too
that
one
is
more
minded
to
say
it
serves
her
right
than
pity
no
i
hold
with
there
she
was
no
otherwise
than
a
girl
mind
and
how
could
she
tell
what
the
man
was
made
of
if
really
true
too
hard
a
punishment
and
more
than
she
ought
to
that
this
was
to
some
footsteps
that
were
heard
approaching
smallbury
said
a
dim
figure
in
the
shades
coming
up
and
joining
them
as
a
hedge
it
i
all
but
missed
the
plank
over
the
river
there
in
the
did
such
a
thing
before
in
my
life
be
ye
any
of
workfolk
he
peered
into
their
faces
us
we
met
here
a
few
minutes
i
hear
sam
samway
thought
i
knowed
the
voice
too
going
in
but
i
say
william
samway
whispered
ye
heard
this
strange
tale
about
sergeant
troy
being
seen
mean
souls
said
smallbury
also
lowering
his
voice
in
i
have
laban
tall
named
a
hint
of
it
to
me
but
i
think
it
hark
here
laban
comes
himself
a
footstep
drew
near
i
said
tall
ye
heard
any
more
about
that
said
tall
joining
the
group
inclined
to
think
better
keep
quiet
if
so
be
not
true
flurry
her
and
do
her
much
harm
to
repeat
it
and
if
so
be
true
do
no
good
to
forestall
her
time
trouble
god
send
that
it
mid
be
a
lie
for
though
henery
fray
and
some
of
do
speak
against
her
never
been
anything
but
fair
to
me
hot
and
hasty
but
a
brave
girl
never
tell
a
lie
however
much
the
truth
may
harm
her
and
no
cause
to
wish
her
never
do
tell
little
lies
true
and
a
thing
that
can
be
said
of
very
few
ay
all
the
harm
she
thinks
she
says
to
yer
face
nothing
underhand
they
stood
silent
then
every
man
busied
with
his
own
thoughts
during
which
interval
sounds
of
merriment
could
be
heard
within
then
the
front
door
again
opened
the
rays
streamed
out
the
form
of
boldwood
was
seen
in
the
rectangular
area
of
light
the
door
closed
and
boldwood
walked
slowly
down
the
path
master
one
of
the
men
whispered
as
he
neared
them
better
stand
go
in
again
directly
he
would
think
it
unseemly
us
to
be
loitering
boldwood
came
on
and
passed
by
the
men
without
seeing
them
they
being
under
the
bushes
on
the
grass
he
paused
leant
over
the
gate
and
breathed
a
long
breath
they
heard
low
words
come
from
him
hope
to
god
come
or
this
night
will
be
nothing
but
misery
to
me
oh
my
darling
my
darling
why
do
you
keep
me
in
suspense
like
this
he
said
this
to
himself
and
they
all
distinctly
heard
it
boldwood
remained
silent
after
that
and
the
noise
from
indoors
was
again
just
audible
until
a
few
minutes
later
light
wheels
could
be
distinguished
coming
down
the
hill
they
drew
nearer
and
ceased
at
the
gate
boldwood
hastened
back
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
the
light
shone
upon
bathsheba
coming
up
the
path
boldwood
compressed
his
emotion
to
mere
welcome
the
men
marked
her
light
laugh
and
apology
as
she
met
him
he
took
her
into
the
house
and
the
door
closed
again
heaven
i
know
it
was
like
that
with
him
said
one
of
the
men
thought
that
fancy
of
his
was
over
long
know
much
of
master
if
you
thought
that
said
samway
he
should
know
we
heard
what
said
for
the
world
remarked
a
third
wish
we
had
told
of
the
report
at
once
the
first
uneasily
continued
harm
may
come
of
this
than
we
know
of
poor
boldwood
it
will
be
hard
upon
en
i
wish
troy
was
god
forgive
me
for
such
a
wish
a
scoundrel
to
play
a
poor
wife
such
tricks
nothing
has
prospered
in
weatherbury
since
he
came
here
and
now
no
heart
to
go
in
look
into
for
a
few
minutes
first
shall
us
neighbours
samway
tall
and
smallbury
agreed
to
go
to
and
went
out
at
the
gate
the
remaining
ones
entering
the
house
the
three
soon
drew
near
the
approaching
it
from
the
adjoining
orchard
and
not
by
way
of
the
street
the
pane
of
glass
was
illuminated
as
usual
smallbury
was
a
little
in
advance
of
the
rest
when
pausing
he
turned
suddenly
to
his
companions
and
said
see
the
light
from
the
pane
was
now
perceived
to
be
shining
not
upon
the
ivied
wall
as
usual
but
upon
some
object
close
to
the
glass
it
was
a
human
face
come
closer
whispered
samway
and
they
approached
on
tiptoe
there
was
no
disbelieving
the
report
any
longer
face
was
almost
close
to
the
pane
and
he
was
looking
in
not
only
was
he
looking
in
but
he
appeared
to
have
been
arrested
by
a
conversation
which
was
in
progress
in
the
the
voices
of
the
interlocutors
being
those
of
oak
and
the
maltster
spree
is
all
in
her
honour
said
the
old
man
he
made
believe
only
keeping
up
christmas
can
not
say
replied
oak
true
enough
faith
i
can
not
understand
farmer
boldwood
being
such
a
fool
at
his
time
of
life
as
to
ho
and
hanker
after
this
woman
in
the
way
do
and
she
not
care
a
bit
about
the
men
after
recognizing
features
withdrew
across
the
orchard
as
quietly
as
they
had
come
the
air
was
big
with
fortunes
every
word
everywhere
concerned
her
when
they
were
quite
out
of
earshot
all
by
one
instinct
paused
gave
me
quite
a
face
said
tall
breathing
so
it
did
me
said
samway
to
be
done
see
that
any
business
of
ours
smallbury
murmured
dubiously
it
is
a
thing
which
is
business
said
samway
know
very
well
that
on
a
wrong
tack
and
that
quite
in
the
dark
and
we
should
let
know
at
once
laban
you
know
her
better
go
and
ask
to
speak
to
fit
for
any
such
thing
said
laban
nervously
should
think
william
ought
to
do
it
if
anybody
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
smallbury
a
ticklish
business
altogether
why
go
on
to
her
himself
in
a
few
minutes
know
that
he
will
come
well
if
i
must
i
must
i
suppose
tall
reluctantly
answered
must
i
say
ask
to
see
no
i
speak
to
boldwood
if
i
tell
anybody
be
well
said
samway
laban
then
went
to
the
door
when
he
opened
it
the
hum
of
bustle
rolled
out
as
a
wave
upon
a
still
assemblage
being
immediately
inside
the
was
deadened
to
a
murmur
as
he
closed
it
again
each
man
waited
intently
and
looked
around
at
the
dark
tree
tops
gently
rocking
against
the
sky
and
occasionally
shivering
in
a
slight
wind
as
if
he
took
interest
in
the
scene
which
neither
did
one
of
them
began
walking
up
and
down
and
then
came
to
where
he
started
from
and
stopped
again
with
a
sense
that
walking
was
a
thing
not
worth
doing
now
should
think
laban
must
have
seen
mistress
by
this
time
said
smallbury
breaking
the
silence
she
come
and
speak
to
the
door
opened
tall
appeared
and
joined
them
said
both
like
to
ask
for
her
after
all
laban
faltered
out
were
all
in
such
a
stir
trying
to
put
a
little
spirit
into
the
party
somehow
the
fun
seems
to
hang
fire
though
there
that
a
heart
can
desire
and
i
for
my
soul
interfere
and
throw
damp
upon
to
save
my
life
i
suppose
we
had
better
all
go
in
together
said
samway
gloomily
i
may
have
a
chance
of
saying
a
word
to
so
the
men
entered
the
hall
which
was
the
room
selected
and
arranged
for
the
gathering
because
of
its
size
the
younger
men
and
maids
were
at
last
just
beginning
to
dance
bathsheba
had
been
perplexed
how
to
act
for
she
was
not
much
more
than
a
slim
young
maid
herself
and
the
weight
of
stateliness
sat
heavy
upon
her
sometimes
she
thought
she
ought
not
to
have
come
under
any
circumstances
then
she
considered
what
cold
unkindness
that
would
have
been
and
finally
resolved
upon
the
middle
course
of
staying
for
about
an
hour
only
and
gliding
off
unobserved
having
from
the
first
made
up
her
mind
that
she
could
on
no
account
dance
sing
or
take
any
active
part
in
the
proceedings
her
allotted
hour
having
been
passed
in
chatting
and
looking
on
bathsheba
told
liddy
not
to
hurry
herself
and
went
to
the
small
parlour
to
prepare
for
departure
which
like
the
hall
was
decorated
with
holly
and
ivy
and
well
lighted
up
nobody
was
in
the
room
but
she
had
hardly
been
there
a
moment
when
the
master
of
the
house
entered
are
not
going
he
said
hardly
begun
excuse
me
i
should
like
to
go
her
manner
was
restive
for
she
remembered
her
promise
and
imagined
what
he
was
about
to
say
as
it
is
not
late
she
added
can
walk
home
and
leave
my
man
and
liddy
to
come
when
they
been
trying
to
get
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
said
boldwood
know
perhaps
what
i
long
to
say
bathsheba
silently
looked
on
the
floor
do
give
it
he
said
eagerly
she
whispered
evasion
why
the
promise
i
want
to
intrude
upon
you
at
all
or
to
let
it
become
known
to
anybody
but
do
give
your
word
a
mere
business
compact
you
know
between
two
people
who
are
beyond
the
influence
of
boldwood
knew
how
false
this
picture
was
as
regarded
himself
but
he
had
proved
that
it
was
the
only
tone
in
which
she
would
allow
him
to
approach
her
promise
to
marry
me
at
the
end
of
five
years
and
you
owe
it
to
me
feel
that
i
do
said
bathsheba
is
if
you
demand
it
but
i
am
a
changed
unhappy
are
still
a
very
beautiful
woman
said
boldwood
honesty
and
pure
conviction
suggested
the
remark
unaccompanied
by
any
perception
that
it
might
have
been
adopted
by
blunt
flattery
to
soothe
and
win
her
however
it
had
not
much
effect
now
for
she
said
in
a
passionless
murmur
which
was
in
itself
a
proof
of
her
words
have
no
feeling
in
the
matter
at
all
and
i
at
all
know
what
is
right
to
do
in
my
difficult
position
and
i
have
nobody
to
advise
me
but
i
give
my
promise
if
i
must
i
give
it
as
the
rendering
of
a
debt
conditionally
of
course
on
my
being
a
marry
me
between
five
and
six
years
hence
press
me
too
hard
marry
nobody
surely
you
will
name
the
time
or
nothing
in
the
promise
at
all
i
know
pray
let
me
go
she
said
her
bosom
beginning
to
rise
am
afraid
what
to
do
i
want
to
be
just
to
you
and
to
be
that
seems
to
be
wronging
myself
and
perhaps
it
is
breaking
the
commandments
there
is
considerable
doubt
of
his
death
and
then
it
is
dreadful
let
me
ask
a
solicitor
boldwood
if
i
ought
or
no
the
words
dear
one
and
the
subject
shall
be
dismissed
a
blissful
loving
intimacy
of
six
years
and
then
bathsheba
say
them
he
begged
in
a
husky
voice
unable
to
sustain
the
forms
of
mere
friendship
any
longer
yourself
to
me
i
deserve
it
indeed
i
do
for
i
have
loved
you
more
than
anybody
in
the
world
and
if
i
said
hasty
words
and
showed
heat
of
manner
towards
you
believe
me
dear
i
did
not
mean
to
distress
you
i
was
in
agony
bathsheba
and
i
did
not
know
what
i
said
you
let
a
dog
suffer
what
i
have
suffered
could
you
but
know
it
sometimes
i
shrink
from
your
knowing
what
i
have
felt
for
you
and
sometimes
i
am
distressed
that
all
of
it
you
never
will
know
be
gracious
and
give
up
a
little
to
me
when
i
would
give
up
my
life
for
you
the
trimmings
of
her
dress
as
they
quivered
against
the
light
showed
how
agitated
she
was
and
at
last
she
burst
out
crying
anything
i
say
in
five
or
six
years
she
sobbed
when
she
had
power
to
frame
the
words
then
leave
it
to
she
waited
a
moment
well
marry
you
in
six
years
from
this
day
if
we
both
live
she
said
solemnly
take
this
as
a
token
from
boldwood
had
come
close
to
her
side
and
now
he
clasped
one
of
her
hands
in
both
his
own
and
lifted
it
to
his
breast
is
it
oh
i
can
not
wear
a
ring
she
exclaimed
on
seeing
what
he
held
i
have
a
soul
know
that
an
engagement
perhaps
it
is
improper
besides
we
are
not
engaged
in
the
usual
sense
are
we
insist
in
her
trouble
at
not
being
able
to
get
her
hand
away
from
him
at
once
she
stamped
passionately
on
the
floor
with
one
foot
and
tears
crowded
to
her
eyes
again
means
simply
a
seal
of
a
practical
compact
he
said
more
quietly
but
still
retaining
her
hand
in
his
firm
grasp
now
and
boldwood
slipped
the
ring
on
her
finger
can
not
wear
it
she
said
weeping
as
if
her
heart
would
break
frighten
me
almost
so
wild
a
scheme
please
let
me
go
home
wear
it
just
to
please
me
bathsheba
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
buried
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
though
boldwood
kept
her
hand
yet
at
length
she
said
in
a
sort
of
hopeless
well
then
i
will
if
you
wish
it
so
earnestly
now
loosen
my
hand
i
will
indeed
i
will
wear
it
it
shall
be
the
beginning
of
a
pleasant
secret
courtship
of
six
years
with
a
wedding
at
the
end
must
be
i
suppose
since
you
will
have
it
so
she
said
fairly
beaten
into
boldwood
pressed
her
hand
and
allowed
it
to
drop
in
her
lap
am
happy
now
he
said
bless
you
he
left
the
room
and
when
he
thought
she
might
be
sufficiently
composed
sent
one
of
the
maids
to
her
bathsheba
cloaked
the
effects
of
the
late
scene
as
she
best
could
followed
the
girl
and
in
a
few
moments
came
downstairs
with
her
hat
and
cloak
on
ready
to
go
to
get
to
the
door
it
was
necessary
to
pass
through
the
hall
and
before
doing
so
she
paused
on
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
which
descended
into
one
corner
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
gathering
there
was
no
music
or
dancing
in
progress
just
now
at
the
lower
end
which
had
been
arranged
for
the
specially
a
group
conversed
in
whispers
and
with
clouded
looks
boldwood
was
standing
by
the
fireplace
and
he
too
though
so
absorbed
in
visions
arising
from
her
promise
that
he
scarcely
saw
anything
seemed
at
that
moment
to
have
observed
their
peculiar
manner
and
their
looks
askance
is
it
you
are
in
doubt
about
men
he
said
one
of
them
turned
and
replied
uneasily
was
something
laban
heard
of
all
anybody
married
or
engaged
born
or
dead
inquired
the
farmer
gaily
it
to
us
tall
one
would
think
from
your
looks
and
mysterious
ways
that
it
was
something
very
dreadful
no
sir
nobody
is
dead
said
tall
wish
somebody
was
said
samway
in
a
whisper
do
you
say
samway
asked
boldwood
somewhat
sharply
you
have
anything
to
say
speak
out
if
not
get
up
another
troy
has
come
downstairs
said
samway
to
tall
you
want
to
tell
her
you
had
better
do
it
you
know
what
they
mean
the
farmer
asked
bathsheba
across
the
room
in
the
least
said
bathsheba
there
was
a
smart
rapping
at
the
door
one
of
the
men
opened
it
instantly
and
went
outside
troy
is
wanted
he
said
on
returning
ready
said
bathsheba
i
tell
them
to
is
a
stranger
said
the
man
by
the
door
stranger
she
said
him
to
come
in
said
boldwood
the
message
was
given
and
troy
wrapped
up
to
his
eyes
as
we
have
seen
him
stood
in
the
doorway
there
was
an
unearthly
silence
all
looking
towards
the
newcomer
those
who
had
just
learnt
that
he
was
in
the
neighbourhood
recognized
him
instantly
those
who
did
not
were
perplexed
nobody
noted
bathsheba
she
was
leaning
on
the
stairs
her
brow
had
heavily
contracted
her
whole
face
was
pallid
her
lips
apart
her
eyes
rigidly
staring
at
their
visitor
boldwood
was
among
those
who
did
not
notice
that
he
was
troy
in
come
in
he
repeated
cheerfully
drain
a
christmas
beaker
with
us
stranger
troy
next
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room
took
off
his
cap
turned
down
his
and
looked
boldwood
in
the
face
even
then
boldwood
did
not
recognize
that
the
impersonator
of
persistent
irony
towards
him
who
had
once
before
broken
in
upon
his
bliss
scourged
him
and
snatched
his
delight
away
had
come
to
do
these
things
a
second
time
troy
began
to
laugh
a
mechanical
laugh
boldwood
recognized
him
now
troy
turned
to
bathsheba
the
poor
wretchedness
at
this
time
was
beyond
all
fancy
or
narration
she
had
sunk
down
on
the
lowest
stair
and
there
she
sat
her
mouth
blue
and
dry
and
her
dark
eyes
fixed
vacantly
upon
him
as
if
she
wondered
whether
it
were
not
all
a
terrible
illusion
then
troy
spoke
i
come
here
for
you
she
made
no
reply
home
with
me
come
bathsheba
moved
her
feet
a
little
but
did
not
rise
troy
went
across
to
her
madam
do
you
hear
what
i
say
he
said
peremptorily
a
strange
voice
came
from
the
voice
sounding
far
off
and
confined
as
if
from
a
dungeon
hardly
a
soul
in
the
assembly
recognized
the
thin
tones
to
be
those
of
boldwood
sudden
despair
had
transformed
him
go
with
your
husband
nevertheless
she
did
not
move
the
truth
was
that
bathsheba
was
beyond
the
pale
of
yet
not
in
a
swoon
she
was
in
a
state
of
mental
her
mind
was
for
the
minute
totally
deprived
of
light
at
the
same
time
no
obscuration
was
apparent
from
without
troy
stretched
out
his
hand
to
pull
her
towards
him
when
she
quickly
shrank
back
this
visible
dread
of
him
seemed
to
irritate
troy
and
he
seized
her
arm
and
pulled
it
sharply
whether
his
grasp
pinched
her
or
whether
his
mere
touch
was
the
cause
was
never
known
but
at
the
moment
of
his
seizure
she
writhed
and
gave
a
quick
low
scream
the
scream
had
been
heard
but
a
few
seconds
when
it
was
followed
by
sudden
deafening
report
that
echoed
through
the
room
and
stupefied
them
all
the
oak
partition
shook
with
the
concussion
and
the
place
was
filled
with
grey
smoke
in
bewilderment
they
turned
their
eyes
to
boldwood
at
his
back
as
stood
before
the
fireplace
was
a
as
is
usual
in
farmhouses
constructed
to
hold
two
guns
when
bathsheba
had
cried
out
in
her
grasp
face
of
gnashing
despair
had
changed
the
veins
had
swollen
and
a
frenzied
look
had
gleamed
in
his
eye
he
had
turned
quickly
taken
one
of
the
guns
cocked
it
and
at
once
discharged
it
at
troy
troy
fell
the
distance
apart
of
the
two
men
was
so
small
that
the
charge
of
shot
did
not
spread
in
the
least
but
passed
like
a
bullet
into
his
body
he
uttered
a
long
guttural
was
a
his
muscles
relaxed
and
he
lay
still
boldwood
was
seen
through
the
smoke
to
be
now
again
engaged
with
the
gun
it
was
and
he
had
meanwhile
in
some
way
fastened
his
to
the
trigger
and
with
his
foot
on
the
other
end
was
in
the
act
of
turning
the
second
barrel
upon
himself
samway
his
man
was
the
first
to
see
this
and
in
the
midst
of
the
general
horror
darted
up
to
him
boldwood
had
already
twitched
the
handkerchief
and
the
gun
exploded
a
second
time
sending
its
contents
by
a
timely
blow
from
samway
into
the
beam
which
crossed
the
ceiling
it
makes
no
difference
boldwood
gasped
is
another
way
for
me
to
then
he
broke
from
samway
crossed
the
room
to
bathsheba
and
kissed
her
hand
he
put
on
his
hat
opened
the
door
and
went
into
the
darkness
nobody
thinking
of
preventing
him
chapter
liv
after
the
shock
boldwood
passed
into
the
high
road
and
turned
in
the
direction
of
casterbridge
here
he
walked
at
an
even
steady
pace
over
yalbury
hill
along
the
dead
level
beyond
mounted
mellstock
hill
and
between
eleven
and
twelve
crossed
the
moor
into
the
town
the
streets
were
nearly
deserted
now
and
the
waving
only
lighted
up
rows
of
grey
and
strips
of
white
paving
upon
which
his
step
echoed
as
his
passed
along
he
turned
to
the
right
and
halted
before
an
archway
of
heavy
stonework
which
was
closed
by
an
iron
studded
pair
of
doors
this
was
the
entrance
to
the
gaol
and
over
it
a
lamp
was
fixed
the
light
enabling
the
wretched
traveller
to
find
a
the
small
wicket
at
last
opened
and
a
porter
appeared
boldwood
stepped
forward
and
said
something
in
a
low
tone
when
after
a
delay
another
man
came
boldwood
entered
and
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
and
he
walked
the
world
no
more
long
before
this
time
weatherbury
had
been
thoroughly
aroused
and
the
wild
deed
which
had
terminated
merrymaking
became
known
to
all
of
those
out
of
the
house
oak
was
one
of
the
first
to
hear
of
the
catastrophe
and
when
he
entered
the
room
which
was
about
five
minutes
after
exit
the
scene
was
terrible
all
the
female
guests
were
huddled
aghast
against
the
walls
like
sheep
in
a
storm
and
the
men
were
bewildered
as
to
what
to
do
as
for
bathsheba
she
had
changed
she
was
sitting
on
the
floor
beside
the
body
of
troy
his
head
pillowed
in
her
lap
where
she
had
herself
lifted
it
with
one
hand
she
held
her
handkerchief
to
his
breast
and
covered
the
wound
though
scarcely
a
single
drop
of
blood
had
flowed
and
with
the
other
she
tightly
clasped
one
of
his
the
household
convulsion
had
made
her
herself
again
the
temporary
coma
had
ceased
and
activity
had
come
with
the
necessity
for
it
deeds
of
endurance
which
seem
ordinary
in
philosophy
are
rare
in
conduct
and
bathsheba
was
astonishing
all
around
her
now
for
her
philosophy
was
her
conduct
and
she
seldom
thought
practicable
what
she
did
not
practise
she
was
of
the
stuff
of
which
great
mothers
are
made
she
was
indispensable
to
high
generation
hated
at
tea
parties
feared
in
shops
and
loved
at
crises
troy
recumbent
in
his
lap
formed
now
the
sole
spectacle
in
the
middle
of
the
spacious
room
she
said
automatically
when
he
entered
turning
up
a
face
of
which
only
the
lines
remained
to
tell
him
it
was
hers
all
else
in
the
picture
having
faded
quite
to
casterbridge
instantly
for
a
surgeon
it
is
i
believe
useless
but
go
boldwood
has
shot
my
her
statement
of
the
fact
in
such
quiet
and
simple
words
came
with
more
force
than
a
tragic
declamation
and
had
somewhat
the
effect
of
setting
the
distorted
images
in
each
mind
present
into
proper
focus
oak
almost
before
he
had
comprehended
anything
beyond
the
briefest
abstract
of
the
event
hurried
out
of
the
room
saddled
a
horse
and
rode
away
not
till
he
had
ridden
more
than
a
mile
did
it
occur
to
him
that
he
would
have
done
better
by
sending
some
other
man
on
this
errand
remaining
himself
in
the
house
what
had
become
of
boldwood
he
should
have
been
looked
after
was
he
there
been
a
quarrel
then
how
had
troy
got
there
where
had
he
come
from
how
did
this
remarkable
reappearance
effect
itself
when
he
was
supposed
by
many
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
oak
had
in
some
slight
measure
been
prepared
for
the
presence
of
troy
by
hearing
a
rumour
of
his
return
just
before
entering
house
but
before
he
had
weighed
that
information
this
fatal
event
had
been
superimposed
however
it
was
too
late
now
to
think
of
sending
another
messenger
and
he
rode
on
in
the
excitement
of
these
not
discerning
when
about
three
miles
from
casterbridge
a
pedestrian
passing
along
under
the
dark
hedge
in
the
same
direction
as
his
own
the
miles
necessary
to
be
traversed
and
other
hindrances
incidental
to
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
delayed
the
arrival
of
aldritch
the
surgeon
and
more
than
three
hours
passed
between
the
time
at
which
the
shot
was
fired
and
that
of
his
entering
the
house
oak
was
additionally
detained
in
casterbridge
through
having
to
give
notice
to
the
authorities
of
what
had
happened
and
he
then
found
that
boldwood
had
also
entered
the
town
and
delivered
himself
up
in
the
meantime
the
surgeon
having
hastened
into
the
hall
at
found
it
in
darkness
and
quite
deserted
he
went
on
to
the
back
of
the
house
where
he
discovered
in
the
kitchen
an
old
man
of
whom
he
made
inquiries
had
him
took
away
to
her
own
house
sir
said
his
informant
has
said
the
doctor
troy
was
quite
dead
this
was
astonishing
information
had
no
right
to
do
that
said
the
doctor
will
have
to
be
an
inquest
and
she
should
have
waited
to
know
what
to
sir
it
was
hinted
to
her
that
she
had
better
wait
till
the
law
was
known
but
she
said
law
was
nothing
to
her
and
she
let
her
dear
corpse
bide
neglected
for
folks
to
stare
at
for
all
the
crowners
in
aldritch
drove
at
once
back
again
up
the
hill
to
the
first
person
he
met
was
poor
liddy
who
seemed
literally
to
have
dwindled
smaller
in
these
few
latter
hours
has
been
done
he
said
know
sir
said
liddy
with
suspended
breath
mistress
has
done
it
is
she
with
him
sir
when
he
was
brought
home
and
taken
upstairs
she
said
she
wanted
no
further
help
from
the
men
and
then
she
called
me
and
made
me
fill
the
bath
and
after
that
told
me
i
had
better
go
and
lie
down
because
i
looked
so
then
she
locked
herself
into
the
room
alone
with
him
and
would
not
let
a
nurse
come
in
or
anybody
at
all
but
i
thought
wait
in
the
next
room
in
case
she
should
want
me
i
heard
her
moving
about
inside
for
more
than
an
hour
but
she
only
came
out
once
and
that
was
for
more
candles
because
hers
had
burnt
down
into
the
socket
she
said
we
were
to
let
her
know
when
you
or
thirdly
came
oak
entered
with
the
parson
at
this
moment
and
they
all
went
upstairs
together
preceded
by
liddy
smallbury
everything
was
silent
as
the
grave
when
they
paused
on
the
landing
liddy
knocked
and
dress
was
heard
rustling
across
the
room
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
she
opened
the
door
her
looks
were
calm
and
nearly
rigid
like
a
slightly
animated
bust
of
melpomene
aldritch
you
have
come
at
last
she
murmured
from
her
lips
merely
and
threw
back
the
door
and
thirdly
well
all
is
done
and
anybody
in
the
world
may
see
him
she
then
passed
by
him
crossed
the
landing
and
entered
another
room
looking
into
the
chamber
of
death
she
had
vacated
they
saw
by
the
light
of
the
candles
which
were
on
the
drawers
a
tall
straight
shape
lying
at
the
further
end
of
the
bedroom
wrapped
in
white
everything
around
was
quite
orderly
the
doctor
went
in
and
after
a
few
minutes
returned
to
the
landing
again
where
oak
and
the
parson
still
waited
is
all
done
indeed
as
she
says
remarked
aldritch
in
a
subdued
voice
body
has
been
undressed
and
properly
laid
out
in
grave
clothes
gracious
mere
girl
she
must
have
the
nerve
of
a
stoic
heart
of
a
wife
merely
floated
in
a
whisper
about
the
ears
of
the
three
and
turning
they
saw
bathsheba
in
the
midst
of
them
then
as
if
at
that
instant
to
prove
that
her
fortitude
had
been
more
of
will
than
of
spontaneity
she
silently
sank
down
between
them
and
was
a
shapeless
heap
of
drapery
on
the
floor
the
simple
consciousness
that
superhuman
strain
was
no
longer
required
had
at
once
put
a
period
to
her
power
to
continue
it
they
took
her
away
into
a
further
room
and
the
medical
attendance
which
had
been
useless
in
case
was
invaluable
in
who
fell
into
a
series
of
that
had
a
serious
aspect
for
a
time
the
sufferer
was
got
to
bed
and
oak
finding
from
the
bulletins
that
nothing
really
dreadful
was
to
be
apprehended
on
her
score
left
the
house
liddy
kept
watch
in
chamber
where
she
heard
her
mistress
moaning
in
whispers
through
the
dull
slow
hours
of
that
wretched
night
it
is
my
can
i
live
o
heaven
how
can
i
live
chapter
lv
the
march
we
pass
rapidly
on
into
the
month
of
march
to
a
breezy
day
without
sunshine
frost
or
dew
on
yalbury
hill
about
midway
between
weatherbury
and
casterbridge
where
the
turnpike
road
passes
over
the
crest
a
numerous
concourse
of
people
had
gathered
the
eyes
of
the
greater
number
being
frequently
stretched
afar
in
a
northerly
direction
the
groups
consisted
of
a
throng
of
idlers
a
party
of
and
two
trumpeters
and
in
the
midst
were
carriages
one
of
which
contained
the
high
sheriff
with
the
idlers
many
of
whom
had
mounted
to
the
top
of
a
cutting
formed
for
the
road
were
several
weatherbury
men
and
others
poorgrass
coggan
and
cain
ball
at
the
end
of
a
faint
dust
was
seen
in
the
expected
quarter
and
shortly
after
a
bringing
one
of
the
two
judges
on
the
western
circuit
came
up
the
hill
and
halted
on
the
top
the
judge
changed
carriages
whilst
a
flourish
was
blown
by
the
trumpeters
and
a
procession
being
formed
of
the
vehicles
and
they
all
proceeded
towards
the
town
excepting
the
weatherbury
men
who
as
soon
as
they
had
seen
the
judge
move
off
returned
home
again
to
their
work
i
seed
you
squeezing
close
to
the
carriage
said
coggan
as
they
walked
ye
notice
my
lord
face
did
said
poorgrass
looked
hard
at
en
as
if
i
would
read
his
very
soul
and
there
was
mercy
in
his
to
speak
with
the
exact
truth
required
of
us
at
this
solemn
time
in
the
eye
that
was
towards
i
hope
for
the
best
said
coggan
bad
that
must
be
however
i
go
to
the
trial
and
advise
the
rest
of
ye
that
wanted
to
bide
away
disturb
his
mind
more
than
anything
to
see
us
there
staring
at
him
as
if
he
were
a
very
thing
i
said
this
morning
observed
joseph
is
come
to
weigh
him
in
the
balances
i
said
in
my
reflectious
way
if
found
wanting
so
be
it
unto
him
and
a
bystander
said
hear
a
man
who
can
talk
like
that
ought
to
be
but
i
like
dwelling
upon
it
for
my
few
words
are
my
few
words
and
not
much
though
the
speech
of
some
men
is
rumoured
abroad
as
though
by
nature
formed
for
joseph
and
now
neighbours
as
i
said
every
man
bide
at
the
resolution
was
adhered
to
and
all
waited
anxiously
for
the
news
next
day
their
suspense
was
diverted
however
by
a
discovery
which
was
made
in
the
afternoon
throwing
more
light
on
conduct
and
condition
than
any
details
which
had
preceded
it
that
he
had
been
from
the
time
of
greenhill
fair
until
the
fatal
christmas
eve
in
excited
and
unusual
moods
was
known
to
those
who
had
been
intimate
with
him
but
nobody
imagined
that
there
had
shown
in
him
unequivocal
symptoms
of
the
mental
derangement
which
bathsheba
and
oak
alone
of
all
others
and
at
different
times
had
momentarily
suspected
in
a
locked
closet
was
now
discovered
an
extraordinary
collection
of
articles
there
were
several
sets
of
dresses
in
the
piece
of
sundry
expensive
materials
silks
and
satins
poplins
and
velvets
all
of
colours
which
from
style
of
dress
might
have
been
judged
to
be
her
favourites
there
were
two
muffs
sable
and
ermine
above
all
there
was
a
case
of
jewellery
containing
four
heavy
gold
bracelets
and
several
lockets
and
rings
all
of
fine
quality
and
manufacture
these
things
had
been
bought
in
bath
and
other
towns
from
time
to
time
and
brought
home
by
stealth
they
were
all
carefully
packed
in
paper
and
each
package
was
labelled
boldwood
a
date
being
subjoined
six
years
in
advance
in
every
instance
these
somewhat
pathetic
evidences
of
a
mind
crazed
with
care
and
love
were
the
subject
of
discourse
in
when
oak
entered
from
casterbridge
with
tidings
of
the
sentence
he
came
in
the
afternoon
and
his
face
as
the
kiln
glow
shone
upon
it
told
the
tale
sufficiently
well
boldwood
as
every
one
supposed
he
would
do
had
pleaded
guilty
and
had
been
sentenced
to
death
the
conviction
that
boldwood
had
not
been
morally
responsible
for
his
later
acts
now
became
general
facts
elicited
previous
to
the
trial
had
pointed
strongly
in
the
same
direction
but
they
had
not
been
of
sufficient
weight
to
lead
to
an
order
for
an
examination
into
the
state
of
mind
it
was
astonishing
now
that
a
presumption
of
insanity
was
raised
how
many
collateral
circumstances
were
remembered
to
which
a
condition
of
mental
disease
seemed
to
afford
the
only
others
the
unprecedented
neglect
of
his
corn
stacks
in
the
previous
summer
a
petition
was
addressed
to
the
home
secretary
advancing
the
circumstances
which
appeared
to
justify
a
request
for
a
reconsideration
of
the
sentence
it
was
not
by
the
inhabitants
of
casterbridge
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
for
boldwood
had
never
made
many
friends
over
the
counter
the
shops
thought
it
very
natural
that
a
man
who
by
importing
direct
from
the
producer
had
daringly
set
aside
the
first
great
principle
of
provincial
existence
namely
that
god
made
country
villages
to
supply
customers
to
county
towns
should
have
confused
ideas
about
the
decalogue
the
prompters
were
a
few
merciful
men
who
had
perhaps
too
feelingly
considered
the
facts
latterly
unearthed
and
the
result
was
that
evidence
was
taken
which
it
was
hoped
might
remove
the
crime
in
a
moral
point
of
view
out
of
the
category
of
wilful
murder
and
lead
it
to
be
regarded
as
a
sheer
outcome
of
madness
the
upshot
of
the
petition
was
waited
for
in
weatherbury
with
solicitous
interest
the
execution
had
been
fixed
for
eight
on
a
saturday
morning
about
a
fortnight
after
the
sentence
was
passed
and
up
to
friday
afternoon
no
answer
had
been
received
at
that
time
gabriel
came
from
casterbridge
gaol
whither
he
had
been
to
wish
boldwood
and
turned
down
a
to
avoid
the
town
when
past
the
last
house
he
heard
a
hammering
and
lifting
his
bowed
head
he
looked
back
for
a
moment
over
the
chimneys
he
could
see
the
upper
part
of
the
gaol
entrance
rich
and
glowing
in
the
afternoon
sun
and
some
moving
figures
were
there
they
were
carpenters
lifting
a
post
into
a
vertical
position
within
the
parapet
he
withdrew
his
eyes
quickly
and
hastened
on
it
was
dark
when
he
reached
home
and
half
the
village
was
out
to
meet
him
tidings
gabriel
said
wearily
afraid
no
hope
been
with
him
more
than
two
ye
think
he
was
out
of
his
mind
when
he
did
it
said
smallbury
honestly
say
that
i
do
oak
replied
that
we
can
talk
of
another
time
has
there
been
any
change
in
mistress
this
afternoon
at
she
downstairs
and
getting
on
so
nicely
as
she
was
too
but
very
little
better
now
again
than
she
was
at
christmas
she
keeps
on
asking
if
you
be
come
and
if
news
till
wearied
out
answering
her
shall
i
go
and
say
come
said
oak
a
chance
yet
but
i
stay
in
town
any
seeing
him
too
so
is
here
he
said
tall
arranged
is
that
you
shall
ride
to
town
the
last
thing
leave
here
about
nine
and
wait
a
while
there
getting
home
about
twelve
if
nothing
has
been
received
by
eleven
they
say
no
chance
at
do
so
hope
his
life
will
be
spared
said
liddy
it
is
not
go
out
of
her
mind
too
poor
thing
her
sufferings
have
been
dreadful
she
deserves
she
altered
much
said
coggan
you
seen
poor
mistress
since
christmas
you
know
her
said
liddy
eyes
are
so
miserable
that
not
the
same
woman
only
two
years
ago
she
was
a
romping
girl
and
now
this
laban
departed
as
directed
and
at
eleven
that
night
several
of
the
villagers
strolled
along
the
road
to
casterbridge
and
awaited
his
them
oak
and
nearly
all
the
rest
of
men
anxiety
was
great
that
boldwood
might
be
saved
even
though
in
his
conscience
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
die
for
there
had
been
qualities
in
the
farmer
which
oak
loved
at
last
when
they
all
were
weary
the
tramp
of
a
horse
was
heard
in
the
first
dead
as
if
on
turf
it
trode
then
clattering
on
the
village
road
in
other
pace
than
forth
he
yode
shall
soon
know
now
one
way
or
said
coggan
and
they
all
stepped
down
from
the
bank
on
which
they
had
been
standing
into
the
road
and
the
rider
pranced
into
the
midst
of
them
that
you
laban
said
gabriel
come
not
to
die
confinement
during
her
said
coggan
with
a
swelling
heart
above
the
devil
yet
chapter
lvi
beauty
in
all
bathsheba
revived
with
the
spring
the
utter
prostration
that
had
followed
the
low
fever
from
which
she
had
suffered
diminished
perceptibly
when
all
uncertainty
upon
every
subject
had
come
to
an
end
but
she
remained
alone
now
for
the
greater
part
of
her
time
and
stayed
in
the
house
or
at
furthest
went
into
the
garden
she
shunned
every
one
even
liddy
and
could
be
brought
to
make
no
confidences
and
to
ask
for
no
sympathy
as
the
summer
drew
on
she
passed
more
of
her
time
in
the
open
air
and
began
to
examine
into
farming
matters
from
sheer
necessity
though
she
never
rode
out
or
personally
superintended
as
at
former
times
one
friday
evening
in
august
she
walked
a
little
way
along
the
road
and
entered
the
village
for
the
first
time
since
the
sombre
event
of
the
preceding
christmas
none
of
the
old
colour
had
as
yet
come
to
her
cheek
and
its
absolute
paleness
was
heightened
by
the
jet
black
of
her
gown
till
it
appeared
preternatural
when
she
reached
a
little
shop
at
the
other
end
of
the
place
which
stood
nearly
opposite
to
the
churchyard
bathsheba
heard
singing
inside
the
church
and
she
knew
that
the
singers
were
practising
she
crossed
the
road
opened
the
gate
and
entered
the
graveyard
the
high
sills
of
the
church
windows
effectually
screening
her
from
the
eyes
of
those
gathered
within
her
stealthy
walk
was
to
the
nook
wherein
troy
had
worked
at
planting
flowers
upon
fanny
grave
and
she
came
to
the
marble
tombstone
a
motion
of
satisfaction
enlivened
her
face
as
she
read
the
complete
inscription
first
came
the
words
of
troy
himself
erected
by
francis
troy
in
beloved
memory
of
fanny
robin
who
died
october
aged
years
underneath
this
was
now
inscribed
in
new
letters
in
the
same
grave
lie
the
remains
of
the
aforesaid
francis
troy
who
died
december
aged
years
whilst
she
stood
and
read
and
meditated
the
tones
of
the
organ
began
again
in
the
church
and
she
went
with
the
same
light
step
round
to
the
porch
and
listened
the
door
was
closed
and
the
choir
was
learning
a
new
hymn
bathsheba
was
stirred
by
emotions
which
latterly
she
had
assumed
to
be
altogether
dead
within
her
the
little
attenuated
voices
of
the
children
brought
to
her
ear
in
distinct
utterance
the
words
they
sang
without
thought
or
lead
kindly
light
amid
the
encircling
gloom
lead
thou
me
on
feeling
was
always
to
some
extent
dependent
upon
her
whim
as
is
the
case
with
many
other
women
something
big
came
into
her
throat
and
an
uprising
to
her
she
thought
that
she
would
allow
the
imminent
tears
to
flow
if
they
wished
they
did
flow
and
plenteously
and
one
fell
upon
the
stone
bench
beside
her
once
that
she
had
begun
to
cry
for
she
hardly
knew
what
she
could
not
leave
off
for
crowding
thoughts
she
knew
too
well
she
would
have
given
anything
in
the
world
to
be
as
those
children
were
unconcerned
at
the
meaning
of
their
words
because
too
innocent
to
feel
the
necessity
for
any
such
expression
all
the
impassioned
scenes
of
her
brief
experience
seemed
to
revive
with
added
emotion
at
that
moment
and
those
scenes
which
had
been
without
emotion
during
enactment
had
emotion
then
yet
grief
came
to
her
rather
as
a
luxury
than
as
the
scourge
of
former
times
owing
to
face
being
buried
in
her
hands
she
did
not
notice
a
form
which
came
quietly
into
the
porch
and
on
seeing
her
first
moved
as
if
to
retreat
then
paused
and
regarded
her
bathsheba
did
not
raise
her
head
for
some
time
and
when
she
looked
round
her
face
was
wet
and
her
eyes
drowned
and
dim
oak
exclaimed
she
disconcerted
long
have
you
been
here
few
minutes
said
oak
respectfully
you
going
in
said
bathsheba
and
there
came
from
within
the
church
as
from
a
i
loved
the
garish
day
and
spite
of
fears
pride
ruled
my
will
remember
not
past
years
was
said
gabriel
am
one
of
the
bass
singers
you
know
i
have
sung
bass
for
several
i
aware
of
that
leave
you
which
i
have
loved
long
since
and
lost
awhile
sang
the
children
let
me
drive
you
away
mistress
i
think
i
go
in
drive
me
then
they
stood
in
a
state
of
some
embarrassment
bathsheba
trying
to
wipe
her
dreadfully
drenched
and
inflamed
face
without
his
noticing
her
at
length
oak
said
not
seen
mean
spoken
to
ever
so
long
have
i
but
he
feared
to
bring
distressing
memories
back
and
interrupted
himself
with
you
going
into
church
she
said
came
to
see
the
tombstone
see
if
they
had
cut
the
inscription
as
i
wished
oak
you
mind
speaking
to
me
if
you
wish
to
on
the
matter
which
is
in
both
our
minds
at
this
have
they
done
it
as
you
wished
said
oak
come
and
see
it
if
you
have
not
so
together
they
went
and
read
the
tomb
months
ago
gabriel
murmured
when
he
saw
the
date
seems
like
yesterday
to
to
me
as
if
it
were
years
years
and
i
had
been
dead
between
and
now
i
am
going
home
oak
walked
after
her
wanted
to
name
a
small
matter
to
you
as
soon
as
i
could
he
said
with
hesitation
about
business
and
i
think
i
may
just
mention
it
now
if
allow
yes
is
that
i
may
soon
have
to
give
up
the
management
of
your
farm
mrs
troy
the
fact
is
i
am
thinking
of
leaving
yet
you
england
she
said
in
surprise
and
genuine
disappointment
gabriel
what
are
you
going
to
do
that
for
thought
it
best
oak
stammered
out
is
the
spot
had
in
my
mind
to
it
is
understood
everywhere
that
you
are
going
to
take
poor
farm
on
your
own
had
the
refusal
it
true
but
nothing
is
settled
yet
and
i
have
reasons
for
giving
up
i
shall
finish
out
my
year
there
as
manager
for
the
trustees
but
no
what
shall
i
do
without
you
oh
gabriel
i
think
you
ought
to
go
away
been
with
me
so
bright
times
and
dark
old
friends
as
we
it
seems
unkind
almost
i
had
fancied
that
if
you
leased
the
other
farm
as
master
you
might
still
give
a
helping
look
across
at
mine
and
now
going
away
would
have
now
that
i
am
more
helpless
than
ever
you
go
away
the
ill
fortune
it
said
gabriel
in
a
distressed
tone
it
is
because
of
that
very
helplessness
that
i
feel
bound
to
go
good
afternoon
he
concluded
in
evident
anxiety
to
get
away
and
at
once
went
out
of
the
churchyard
by
a
path
she
could
follow
on
no
pretence
whatever
bathsheba
went
home
her
mind
occupied
with
a
new
trouble
which
being
rather
harassing
than
deadly
was
calculated
to
do
good
by
diverting
her
from
the
chronic
gloom
of
her
life
she
was
set
thinking
a
great
deal
about
oak
and
of
his
wish
to
shun
her
and
there
occurred
to
bathsheba
several
incidents
of
her
latter
intercourse
with
him
which
trivial
when
singly
viewed
amounted
together
to
a
perceptible
disinclination
for
her
society
it
broke
upon
her
at
length
as
a
great
pain
that
her
last
old
disciple
was
about
to
forsake
her
and
flee
he
who
had
believed
in
her
and
argued
on
her
side
when
all
the
rest
of
the
world
was
against
her
had
at
last
like
the
others
become
weary
and
neglectful
of
the
old
cause
and
was
leaving
her
to
fight
her
battles
alone
three
weeks
went
on
and
more
evidence
of
his
want
of
interest
in
her
was
forthcoming
she
noticed
that
instead
of
entering
the
small
parlour
or
office
where
the
farm
accounts
were
kept
and
waiting
or
leaving
a
memorandum
as
he
had
hitherto
done
during
her
seclusion
oak
never
came
at
all
when
she
was
likely
to
be
there
only
entering
at
unseasonable
hours
when
her
presence
in
that
part
of
the
house
was
least
to
be
expected
whenever
he
wanted
directions
he
sent
a
message
or
note
with
neither
heading
nor
signature
to
which
she
was
obliged
to
reply
in
the
same
offhand
style
poor
bathsheba
began
to
suffer
now
from
the
most
torturing
sting
of
sensation
that
she
was
despised
the
autumn
wore
away
gloomily
enough
amid
these
melancholy
conjectures
and
came
completing
a
year
of
her
legal
widowhood
and
two
years
and
a
quarter
of
her
life
alone
on
examining
her
heart
it
appeared
beyond
measure
strange
that
the
subject
of
which
the
season
might
have
been
supposed
event
in
the
hall
at
not
agitating
her
at
all
but
instead
an
agonizing
conviction
that
everybody
abjured
what
she
could
not
that
oak
was
the
ringleader
of
the
recusants
coming
out
of
church
that
day
she
looked
round
in
hope
that
oak
whose
bass
voice
she
had
heard
rolling
out
from
the
gallery
overhead
in
a
most
unconcerned
manner
might
chance
to
linger
in
her
path
in
the
old
way
there
he
was
as
usual
coming
down
the
path
behind
her
but
on
seeing
bathsheba
turn
he
looked
aside
and
as
soon
as
he
got
beyond
the
gate
and
there
was
the
barest
excuse
for
a
divergence
he
made
one
and
vanished
the
next
morning
brought
the
culminating
stroke
she
had
been
expecting
it
long
it
was
a
formal
notice
by
letter
from
him
that
he
should
not
renew
his
engagement
with
her
for
the
following
bathsheba
actually
sat
and
cried
over
this
letter
most
bitterly
she
was
aggrieved
and
wounded
that
the
possession
of
hopeless
love
from
gabriel
which
she
had
grown
to
regard
as
her
inalienable
right
for
life
should
have
been
withdrawn
just
at
his
own
pleasure
in
this
way
she
was
bewildered
too
by
the
prospect
of
having
to
rely
on
her
own
resources
again
it
seemed
to
herself
that
she
never
could
again
acquire
energy
sufficient
to
go
to
market
barter
and
sell
since
death
oak
had
attended
all
sales
and
fairs
for
her
transacting
her
business
at
the
same
time
with
his
own
what
should
she
do
now
her
life
was
becoming
a
desolation
so
desolate
was
bathsheba
this
evening
that
in
an
absolute
hunger
for
pity
and
sympathy
and
miserable
in
that
she
appeared
to
have
outlived
the
only
true
friendship
she
had
ever
owned
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
cloak
and
went
down
to
house
just
after
sunset
guided
on
her
way
by
the
pale
primrose
rays
of
a
crescent
moon
a
few
days
old
a
lively
firelight
shone
from
the
window
but
nobody
was
visible
in
the
room
she
tapped
nervously
and
then
thought
it
doubtful
if
it
were
right
for
a
single
woman
to
call
upon
a
bachelor
who
lived
alone
although
he
was
her
manager
and
she
might
be
supposed
to
call
on
business
without
any
real
impropriety
gabriel
opened
the
door
and
the
moon
shone
upon
his
forehead
oak
said
bathsheba
faintly
i
am
oak
said
gabriel
have
i
the
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
know
you
mistress
shall
not
be
your
mistress
much
longer
shall
i
gabriel
she
said
in
pathetic
tones
no
i
come
in
get
a
light
oak
replied
with
some
awkwardness
not
on
my
is
so
seldom
that
i
get
a
lady
visitor
that
afraid
i
proper
accommodation
will
you
sit
down
please
a
chair
and
one
too
i
am
sorry
that
my
chairs
all
have
wood
seats
and
are
rather
hard
but
thinking
of
getting
some
new
oak
placed
two
or
three
for
her
are
quite
easy
enough
for
so
down
she
sat
and
down
sat
he
the
fire
dancing
in
their
faces
and
upon
the
old
furniture
all
long
years
handlen
that
formed
array
of
household
possessions
which
sent
back
a
dancing
reflection
in
reply
it
was
very
odd
to
these
two
persons
who
knew
each
other
passing
well
that
the
mere
circumstance
of
their
meeting
in
a
new
place
and
in
a
new
way
should
make
them
so
awkward
and
constrained
in
the
fields
or
at
her
house
there
had
never
been
any
embarrassment
but
now
that
oak
had
become
the
entertainer
their
lives
seemed
to
be
moved
back
again
to
the
days
when
they
were
strangers
think
it
strange
that
i
have
come
no
not
at
i
i
have
been
uneasy
in
the
belief
that
i
have
offended
you
and
that
you
are
going
away
on
that
account
it
grieved
me
very
much
and
i
help
me
as
if
you
could
do
that
bathsheba
i
she
asked
gladly
what
are
you
going
away
for
else
am
not
going
to
emigrate
you
know
i
aware
that
you
would
wish
me
not
to
when
i
told
or
i
thought
of
doing
it
he
said
simply
have
arranged
for
little
weatherbury
farm
and
shall
have
it
in
my
own
hands
at
you
know
had
a
share
in
it
for
some
time
still
that
prevent
my
attending
to
your
business
as
before
it
been
that
things
have
been
said
about
said
bathsheba
in
surprise
said
about
you
and
me
what
are
they
can
not
tell
would
be
wiser
if
you
were
to
i
think
you
have
played
the
part
of
mentor
to
me
many
times
and
i
see
why
you
should
fear
to
do
it
is
nothing
that
you
have
done
this
time
the
top
and
tail
is
i
am
sniffing
about
here
and
waiting
for
poor
farm
with
a
thought
of
getting
you
some
me
what
does
that
mean
of
in
plain
british
you
asked
me
to
tell
so
you
blame
bathsheba
did
not
look
quite
so
alarmed
as
if
a
cannon
had
been
discharged
by
her
ear
which
was
what
oak
had
expected
me
i
know
it
was
that
you
meant
she
said
quietly
a
thing
as
that
is
too
think
of
by
far
of
course
it
is
too
absurd
i
desire
any
such
thing
i
should
think
that
was
plain
enough
by
this
time
surely
surely
you
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
think
of
marrying
it
is
too
absurd
as
you
were
the
words
i
must
beg
your
pardon
for
correcting
you
but
you
said
absurd
and
so
do
beg
your
pardon
too
she
returned
with
tears
in
her
eyes
was
what
i
said
but
it
matter
a
at
i
only
meant
indeed
i
oak
and
you
must
believe
me
gabriel
looked
her
long
in
the
face
but
the
firelight
being
faint
there
was
not
much
to
be
seen
he
said
tenderly
and
in
surprise
and
coming
closer
i
only
knew
one
you
would
allow
me
to
love
you
and
win
you
and
marry
you
after
i
only
knew
that
you
never
will
know
she
murmured
you
never
said
gabriel
with
a
low
laugh
of
joyousness
own
ought
not
to
have
sent
me
that
harsh
letter
this
morning
she
interrupted
shows
you
care
a
bit
about
me
and
were
ready
to
desert
me
like
all
the
rest
of
them
it
was
very
cruel
of
you
considering
i
was
the
first
sweetheart
that
you
ever
had
and
you
were
the
first
i
ever
had
and
i
shall
not
forget
it
bathsheba
was
ever
anybody
so
provoking
he
said
laughing
know
it
was
purely
that
i
as
an
unmarried
man
carrying
on
a
business
for
you
as
a
very
taking
young
woman
had
a
proper
hard
part
to
particular
that
people
knew
i
had
a
sort
of
feeling
for
and
i
fancied
from
the
way
we
were
mentioned
together
that
it
might
injure
your
good
name
nobody
knows
the
heat
and
fret
i
have
been
caused
by
was
that
all
how
glad
i
am
i
came
she
exclaimed
thankfully
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
have
thought
so
much
more
of
you
since
i
fancied
you
did
not
want
even
to
see
me
again
but
i
must
be
going
now
or
i
shall
be
missed
why
gabriel
she
said
with
a
slight
laugh
as
they
went
to
the
door
seems
exactly
as
if
i
had
come
courting
dreadful
quite
right
too
said
oak
danced
at
your
skittish
heels
my
beautiful
bathsheba
for
many
a
long
mile
and
many
a
long
day
and
it
is
hard
to
begrudge
me
this
one
he
accompanied
her
up
the
hill
explaining
to
her
the
details
of
his
forthcoming
tenure
of
the
other
farm
they
spoke
very
little
of
their
mutual
feeling
pretty
phrases
and
warm
expressions
being
probably
unnecessary
between
such
tried
friends
theirs
was
that
substantial
affection
which
arises
if
any
arises
at
all
when
the
two
who
are
thrown
together
begin
first
by
knowing
the
rougher
sides
of
each
character
and
not
the
best
till
further
on
the
romance
growing
up
in
the
interstices
of
a
mass
of
hard
prosaic
reality
this
occurring
through
similarity
of
pursuits
is
unfortunately
seldom
superadded
to
love
between
the
sexes
because
men
and
women
associate
not
in
their
labours
but
in
their
pleasures
merely
where
however
happy
circumstance
permits
its
development
the
compounded
feeling
proves
itself
to
be
the
only
love
which
is
strong
as
love
which
many
waters
can
not
quench
nor
the
floods
drown
beside
which
the
passion
usually
called
by
the
name
is
evanescent
as
steam
chapter
lvii
a
foggy
night
and
most
private
secret
plainest
wedding
that
it
is
possible
to
those
had
been
words
to
oak
one
evening
some
time
after
the
event
of
the
preceding
chapter
and
he
meditated
a
full
hour
by
the
clock
upon
how
to
carry
out
her
wishes
to
the
letter
yes
it
must
be
a
license
he
said
to
himself
at
last
well
then
first
a
on
a
dark
night
a
few
days
later
oak
came
with
mysterious
steps
from
the
door
in
casterbridge
on
the
way
home
he
heard
a
heavy
tread
in
front
of
him
and
overtaking
the
man
found
him
to
be
coggan
they
walked
together
into
the
village
until
they
came
to
a
little
lane
behind
the
church
leading
down
to
the
cottage
of
laban
tall
who
had
lately
been
installed
as
clerk
of
the
parish
and
was
yet
in
mortal
terror
at
church
on
sundays
when
he
heard
his
lone
voice
among
certain
hard
words
of
the
psalms
whither
no
man
ventured
to
follow
him
coggan
said
oak
going
down
this
said
coggan
surprised
going
on
then
make
so
bold
oak
it
seemed
rather
ungenerous
not
to
tell
coggan
under
the
circumstances
for
coggan
had
been
true
as
steel
all
through
the
time
of
unhappiness
about
bathsheba
and
gabriel
said
can
keep
a
secret
coggan
proved
me
and
you
i
have
and
i
do
know
well
then
mistress
and
i
mean
to
get
married
high
tower
and
yet
thought
of
such
a
thing
from
time
to
time
true
i
have
but
keeping
it
so
close
well
there
no
consarn
of
of
mine
and
i
wish
joy
you
coggan
but
i
assure
that
this
great
hush
is
not
what
i
wished
for
at
all
or
what
either
of
us
would
have
wished
if
it
been
for
certain
things
that
would
make
a
gay
wedding
seem
hardly
the
thing
bathsheba
has
a
great
wish
that
all
the
parish
shall
not
be
in
church
looking
at
and
nervous
about
it
in
i
be
doing
this
to
humour
i
see
quite
right
too
i
suppose
i
must
say
and
you
be
now
going
down
to
the
you
may
as
well
come
with
am
afeard
your
labour
in
keeping
it
close
will
be
throwed
away
said
coggan
as
they
walked
along
old
woman
will
horn
it
all
over
parish
in
she
will
upon
my
life
i
never
thought
of
that
said
oak
pausing
i
must
tell
him
i
suppose
for
working
so
far
off
and
leaves
tell
how
we
could
tackle
her
said
coggan
knock
and
ask
to
speak
to
laban
outside
the
door
you
standing
in
the
background
then
come
out
and
you
can
tell
yer
tale
never
guess
what
i
want
en
for
and
make
up
a
few
words
about
the
as
a
this
scheme
was
considered
feasible
and
coggan
advanced
boldly
and
rapped
at
door
mrs
tall
herself
opened
it
wanted
to
have
a
word
with
not
at
home
and
be
this
side
of
eleven
been
forced
to
go
over
to
yalbury
since
shutting
out
work
i
shall
do
quite
as
hardly
think
you
will
stop
a
moment
and
coggan
stepped
round
the
corner
of
the
porch
to
consult
oak
man
then
said
mrs
tall
a
friend
said
coggan
wanted
to
meet
mistress
near
morning
at
ten
said
oak
in
a
whisper
he
must
come
without
fail
and
wear
his
best
clothes
will
floor
us
as
safe
as
houses
said
coggan
be
helped
said
oak
so
coggan
delivered
the
message
het
or
wet
blow
or
snow
he
must
come
added
very
particular
indeed
the
fact
is
to
witness
her
sign
some
about
taking
shares
another
farmer
for
a
long
span
years
there
what
and
now
told
mother
tall
in
a
way
i
done
if
i
loved
so
hopeless
coggan
retired
before
she
could
ask
any
further
and
next
they
called
at
the
in
a
manner
which
excited
no
curiosity
at
all
then
gabriel
went
home
and
prepared
for
the
morrow
said
bathsheba
on
going
to
bed
that
night
want
you
to
call
me
at
seven
in
case
i
you
always
do
wake
afore
then
but
i
have
something
important
to
do
which
tell
you
of
when
the
time
comes
and
best
to
make
bathsheba
however
awoke
voluntarily
at
four
nor
could
she
by
any
contrivance
get
to
sleep
again
about
six
being
quite
positive
that
her
watch
had
stopped
during
the
night
she
could
wait
no
longer
she
went
and
tapped
at
door
and
after
some
labour
awoke
her
i
thought
it
was
i
who
had
to
call
you
said
the
bewildered
liddy
it
six
it
is
how
can
you
tell
such
a
story
liddy
i
know
it
must
be
ever
so
much
past
seven
come
to
my
room
as
soon
as
you
can
i
want
you
to
give
my
hair
a
good
when
liddy
came
to
room
her
mistress
was
already
waiting
liddy
could
not
understand
this
extraordinary
promptness
going
on
she
said
tell
you
said
bathsheba
with
a
mischievous
smile
in
her
bright
eyes
oak
is
coming
here
to
dine
with
me
nobody
else
two
alone
is
it
safe
after
been
said
asked
her
companion
dubiously
good
name
is
such
a
perishable
article
bathsheba
laughed
with
a
flushed
cheek
and
whispered
in
ear
although
there
was
nobody
present
then
liddy
stared
and
exclaimed
alive
what
news
it
makes
my
heart
go
quite
makes
mine
rather
furious
too
said
bathsheba
no
getting
out
of
it
now
it
was
a
damp
disagreeable
morning
nevertheless
at
twenty
minutes
to
ten
oak
came
out
of
his
house
and
went
up
the
hill
side
with
that
sort
of
stride
a
man
puts
out
when
walking
in
search
of
a
bride
and
knocked
at
door
ten
minutes
later
a
large
and
a
smaller
umbrella
might
have
been
seen
moving
from
the
same
door
and
through
the
mist
along
the
road
to
the
church
the
distance
was
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
these
two
sensible
persons
deemed
it
unnecessary
to
drive
an
observer
must
have
been
very
close
indeed
to
discover
that
the
forms
under
the
umbrellas
were
those
of
oak
and
bathsheba
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
oak
in
a
greatcoat
extending
to
his
knees
and
bathsheba
in
a
cloak
that
reached
her
clogs
yet
though
so
plainly
dressed
there
was
a
certain
rejuvenated
appearance
about
her
as
though
a
rose
should
shut
and
be
a
bud
again
repose
had
again
incarnadined
her
cheeks
and
having
at
request
arranged
her
hair
this
morning
as
she
had
worn
it
years
ago
on
norcombe
hill
she
seemed
in
his
eyes
remarkably
like
a
girl
of
that
fascinating
dream
which
considering
that
she
was
now
only
three
or
was
perhaps
not
very
wonderful
in
the
church
were
tall
liddy
and
the
parson
and
in
a
remarkably
short
space
of
time
the
deed
was
done
the
two
sat
down
very
quietly
to
tea
in
parlour
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
for
it
had
been
arranged
that
farmer
oak
should
go
there
to
live
since
he
had
as
yet
neither
money
house
nor
furniture
worthy
of
the
name
though
he
was
on
a
sure
way
towards
them
whilst
bathsheba
was
comparatively
in
a
plethora
of
all
three
just
as
bathsheba
was
pouring
out
a
cup
of
tea
their
ears
were
greeted
by
the
firing
of
a
cannon
followed
by
what
seemed
like
a
tremendous
blowing
of
trumpets
in
the
front
of
the
house
said
oak
laughing
knew
those
fellows
were
up
to
something
by
the
look
on
their
oak
took
up
the
light
and
went
into
the
porch
followed
by
bathsheba
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
the
rays
fell
upon
a
group
of
male
figures
gathered
upon
the
gravel
in
front
who
when
they
saw
the
couple
in
the
porch
set
up
a
loud
and
at
the
same
moment
bang
again
went
the
cannon
in
the
background
followed
by
a
hideous
clang
of
music
from
a
drum
tambourine
clarionet
serpent
hautboy
and
only
remaining
relics
of
the
true
and
original
weatherbury
instruments
which
had
celebrated
in
their
own
persons
the
victories
of
marlborough
under
the
fingers
of
the
forefathers
of
those
who
played
them
now
the
performers
came
forward
and
marched
up
to
the
front
bright
boys
mark
clark
and
jan
are
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
said
oak
in
souls
and
have
something
to
eat
and
drink
me
and
my
said
clark
with
evident
ye
all
the
same
but
call
at
a
more
seemly
time
however
we
think
of
letting
the
day
pass
without
a
note
of
admiration
of
some
sort
if
ye
could
send
a
drop
of
down
to
why
so
it
is
long
life
and
happiness
to
neighbour
oak
and
his
comely
bride
ye
thank
ye
all
said
gabriel
bit
and
a
drop
shall
be
sent
to
for
ye
at
once
i
had
a
thought
that
we
might
very
likely
get
a
salute
of
some
sort
from
our
old
friends
and
i
was
saying
so
to
my
wife
but
said
coggan
in
a
critical
tone
turning
to
his
companions
man
hev
learnt
to
say
in
a
wonderful
naterel
way
considering
how
very
youthful
he
is
in
wedlock
as
neighbours

never
heerd
a
skilful
old
married
feller
of
twenty
standing
pipe
in
a
more

jacob

little
more
true

been
spoke
a
little
chillier
but
that
to
be
expected
just
improvement
will
come
time
said
jan
twirling
his
eye
then
oak
laughed
and
bathsheba
smiled
for
she
never
laughed
readily
now
and
their
friends
turned
to
go
i
suppose
the
size
said
joseph
poorgrass
with
a
cheerful
sigh
as
they
moved
away
i
wish
him
joy
her
though
i
were
once
or
twice
