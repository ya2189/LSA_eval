helen
danger
she
stood
a
moment
as
a
pythoness
stands
on
her
tripod
agonized
and
full
of
inspiration
from
distress
when
all
the
like
wild
horses
pull
the
heart
asunder
then
as
more
or
less
their
speed
abated
or
their
strength
grew
dull
she
sank
down
byron
when
grahame
had
locked
the
door
he
flung
the
key
upon
the
table
and
motioned
his
daughter
to
a
seat
she
silently
declined
to
accept
it
he
paced
the
library
for
a
few
minutes
his
emotions
were
terrible
but
they
were
the
strugglings
of
pride
vain
haughty
ambitious
pride
not
such
as
he
would
have
been
justified
in
possessing
helen
stood
motionless
and
faint
she
dreaded
the
demanded
explanation
which
seemed
each
instant
to
draw
nearer
her
heart
throbbed
painfully
so
painfully
it
seemed
as
though
each
throb
depriving
her
of
life
would
be
the
last
at
length
grahame
confronted
her
he
exclaimed
have
you
to
offer
in
explanation
of
the
degraded
and
scandalous
conduct
of
which
you
have
been
guilty
in
flying
from
your
home
and
the
audacious
presumption
you
have
exhibited
in
presenting
yourself
here
again
her
bosom
heaved
and
her
throat
swelled
but
she
spoke
not
demand
to
know
he
continued
fiercely
you
quitted
position
family
a
wealthy
home
in
a
manner
so
disgracefully
clandestine
so
utterly
reckless
of
the
honour
or
the
pride
of
our
house
i
claim
to
know
what
you
have
been
doing
during
your
absence
and
why
now
like
some
spectre
you
suddenly
appear
among
us
to
bring
further
shame
and
disgrace
upon
us
speak
her
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
the
events
of
the
last
few
months
raced
through
her
brain
oh
how
was
she
to
acknowledge
one
incident
at
least
to
him
she
remained
silent
he
bit
his
lips
and
seized
her
wrist
harshly
must
you
shall
speak
he
cried
hoarsely
i
will
find
a
way
to
make
you
that
shall
bring
you
upon
your
bended
knees
in
supplication
to
be
spared
the
torture
tell
me
girl
for
whom
and
with
whom
you
fled
from
home
he
committed
an
error
when
he
thus
acting
sought
to
terrify
her
into
an
explanation
he
only
roused
her
proud
nature
by
a
sudden
motion
she
flung
his
hand
from
her
acted
alone
and
without
being
influenced
by
any
person
she
replied
firmly
even
haughtily
motive
will
learn
it
some
now
i
insist
upon
hearing
it
it
would
be
premature
nothing
is
to
be
gained
by
the
disclosure
but
pain
it
is
enough
that
i
did
what
i
have
done
under
the
promptings
of
my
own
will
i
have
taken
the
consequences
and
i
am
prepared
to
endure
them
i
ask
nothing
of
you
but
to
be
allowed
to
language
is
this
am
i
not
your
father
have
i
no
title
to
control
your
actions
preposterous
notion
you
will
find
your
error
and
repent
it
sorely
have
done
so
she
said
with
an
earnestness
which
struck
him
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
gazed
steadfastly
at
her
means
this
alteration
in
you
why
are
you
so
pallid
and
thin
he
asked
abruptly
have
been
me
he
asked
with
a
choking
utterance
whom
have
you
dwelt
since
you
left
this
house
young
girl
he
echoed
in
surprise
this
was
a
question
he
had
feared
to
ask
and
he
anticipated
from
her
a
direct
refusal
to
reply
he
was
amazed
at
the
readiness
with
which
she
responded
sir
she
continued
in
a
thoughtful
voice
which
had
a
singular
tone
of
sadness
pervading
it
a
model
of
purity
innocence
and
faithfulness
have
been
with
her
alone
up
to
the
hour
you
came
hither
her
you
swear
this
the
face
of
heaven
it
is
true
grahame
paced
the
room
again
there
was
intense
relief
afforded
to
him
by
her
replies
for
heartless
and
selfish
he
cared
little
what
she
had
suffered
during
what
he
considered
to
be
her
madly
capricious
act
so
that
she
had
not
disgraced
his
name
he
would
have
looked
over
even
her
if
he
had
been
sure
that
the
crime
was
confined
alone
to
her
breast
and
that
of
the
partner
of
her
sin
and
it
would
not
interfere
with
his
scheme
he
said
pausing
abruptly
before
her
must
give
me
your
promise
that
you
will
some
day
explain
the
mystery
which
hangs
over
the
interval
of
your
flight
from
home
if
i
forbear
to
urge
it
now
do
sir
she
replied
in
a
low
tone
again
he
took
several
turns
across
the
room
before
he
could
bring
out
his
proposition
but
at
length
he
stopped
and
recommenced
speaking
he
said
are
had
he
struck
her
a
blow
upon
the
temple
it
would
have
had
less
effect
she
staggered
and
clung
o
the
table
are
ill
he
said
hastily
she
answered
in
a
hollow
tone
far
as
i
know
he
said
have
had
no
offer
for
your
hand
no
suitor
who
has
distinctly
proposed
many
intimations
i
know
have
been
made
but
i
have
always
turned
a
cold
face
upon
them
for
i
would
elevate
you
in
rank
and
surround
you
with
wealth
such
a
chance
offers
itself
for
your
acceptance
she
uttered
a
faint
cry
and
recoiled
from
him
he
said
sternly
is
for
you
to
repair
the
past
and
the
opportunity
is
within
your
grasp
beware
how
you
fling
it
she
tried
to
speak
but
her
voice
failed
her
must
not
and
shall
not
now
interpose
your
will
between
mine
and
a
most
important
object
i
have
in
view
he
cried
sternly
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
marry
oh
no
no
no
she
gasped
say
continued
her
father
the
necessity
is
imperious
can
not
dare
not
listen
hear
what
there
is
need
for
you
to
dare
helen
i
am
a
beggar
helen
almost
shrieked
he
uttered
those
words
in
a
tone
so
frightful
he
repeated
stand
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
beggary
god
knows
what
horrors
you
can
save
helen
clasped
her
hands
and
sobbed
convulsively
helen
can
i
swear
to
you
save
me
your
mother
the
house
itself
from
destruction
and
disgrace
my
lord
elsingham
whom
you
met
at
dinner
is
a
peer
of
enormous
wealth
he
has
just
expressed
himself
greatly
prepossessed
in
your
favour
it
rests
with
you
to
follow
up
this
favourable
impression
and
he
is
your
own
the
coronet
of
a
peeress
will
grace
your
temples
your
sister
will
i
trust
win
the
duke
and
in
these
two
marriages
we
may
defy
fate
itself
you
helen
will
prove
my
salvation
do
only
but
this
and
the
agony
of
the
past
will
be
compensated
by
the
splendour
of
the
it
is
not
possible
to
depict
intense
anguish
on
hearing
this
terrible
revelation
or
her
horror
to
find
that
even
if
prepared
to
sacrifice
her
heart
to
save
her
credit
it
would
not
now
be
possible
to
do
so
she
clasped
her
hands
and
fell
upon
her
knees
before
him
sir
sir
she
moaned
in
dire
grief
there
no
other
way
to
save
you
none
none
one
loophole
to
creep
out
of
he
cried
hoarsely
had
promised
to
share
with
me
the
estates
we
both
claim
he
has
recalled
that
promise
and
vast
sums
are
now
demanded
of
me
which
i
can
not
pay
if
however
it
is
known
that
you
are
about
to
become
the
bride
of
one
of
the
wealthiest
peers
in
the
kingdom
the
harpies
will
wait
and
i
shall
be
avenging
heaven
she
cried
i
can
not
do
this
to
save
them
all
cried
her
father
gripping
her
wrist
hard
and
hissing
in
her
ear
must
do
this
may
have
happened
you
must
marry
this
peer
i
ask
you
to
reveal
nothing
keep
your
secret
but
marry
him
you
must
or
ruin
disgrace
death
stares
me
in
the
face
recover
yourself
be
composed
i
leave
you
for
a
short
time
or
my
absence
will
be
remarked
upon
when
i
come
back
i
shall
find
you
cold
and
firm
and
calm
resolved
at
price
to
carry
out
what
i
demand
of
you
not
a
word
not
a
word
as
he
spoke
he
put
her
from
him
she
would
have
clung
entreatingly
to
him
not
to
exact
from
her
a
task
so
wholly
impossible
for
her
to
fulfil
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
and
locked
the
door
without
leaving
her
a
prisoner
there
in
an
agony
of
tears
she
reflected
on
her
position
can
not
must
not
shall
not
be
she
moaned
wringing
her
hands
while
she
spoke
i
will
fly
to
wilton
lotte
has
spoken
of
his
tenderness
of
heart
i
will
appeal
to
him
on
my
knees
to
save
my
father
he
will
not
resist
my
tears
my
prayers
yes
yes
i
will
go
to
him
but
for
this
marriage
ugh
she
shuddered
violently
death
death
rather
than
she
tottered
to
the
door
and
turned
the
handle
but
it
was
fast
she
pressed
against
it
but
it
would
not
yield
she
made
to
the
window
she
remembered
the
iron
staircase
which
led
into
the
garden
the
window
was
unfastened
but
she
alas
was
in
full
dress
she
cast
her
eyes
to
the
door
wistfully
and
thought
she
perceived
the
handle
move
she
hurried
to
it
and
kneeling
down
tried
to
peer
through
the
keyhole
she
heard
a
soft
low
voice
breathe
her
name
and
she
knew
who
was
without
watching
for
her
she
whispered
in
a
low
voice
darling
eva
not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
hasten
with
my
bonnet
and
my
mantle
to
the
slope
beneath
the
library
dearest
murmured
the
soft
low
voice
you
will
not
leave
us
again
sister
eva
if
you
love
me
do
what
i
ask
i
will
be
more
explicit
when
we
are
together
below
she
urged
almost
frantically
you
love
me
eva
oh
if
you
love
me
sweet
will
do
what
you
wish
dear
helen
replied
her
sister
softly
will
be
down
on
the
slope
within
a
few
to
helen
the
very
mention
of
such
a
time
seemed
an
age
she
tied
her
handkerchief
about
her
neck
and
stole
softly
to
the
window
which
had
several
times
admitted
chewkle
to
her
presence
secretly
she
opened
it
gently
and
looked
out
it
seemed
very
dark
and
she
instinctively
shuddered
she
turned
and
looked
round
the
library
hastily
all
was
perfectly
silent
yet
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
door
would
suddenly
fly
open
and
her
father
with
angry
aspect
appear
and
pursue
her
she
stepped
upon
the
narrow
iron
staircase
and
closed
the
window
after
her
then
she
swiftly
and
noiselessly
descended
the
steps
and
stood
shivering
upon
the
grass
slope
she
looked
up
at
the
house
lights
blazed
in
all
the
windows
but
in
the
garden
sombre
darkness
reigned
she
listened
intensely
for
she
fancied
she
heard
a
footfall
upon
the
gravel
path
but
the
sound
was
not
repeated
until
she
heard
a
light
rustling
noise
in
another
moment
after
this
reached
her
ear
she
felt
herself
encircled
in
the
arms
of
evangeline
who
had
hastily
thrown
a
large
shawl
over
her
head
to
protect
herself
from
the
cold
helen
took
from
her
hand
the
garments
for
which
she
had
asked
and
hastily
attired
herself
dare
not
stay
longer
with
you
my
own
darling
eva
she
whispered
to
her
have
escaped
as
you
see
now
from
the
library
in
which
papa
had
why
helen
asked
evangeline
me
not
now
love
she
returned
quickly
day
you
shall
be
made
acquainted
with
the
reason
of
my
flight
and
why
i
have
returned
only
to
leave
you
once
helen
it
seems
so
dreadful
for
you
who
were
the
brightest
ornament
of
our
house
to
become
blot
its
stain
interrupted
helen
passionately
no
no
interposed
evangeline
hastily
meant
not
that
oh
pray
pray
helen
remain
with
us
now
everything
will
come
bright
again
if
all
the
others
look
cold
upon
you
at
first
they
will
come
round
to
regard
you
as
they
did
ere
you
left
us
and
you
know
helen
that
i
will
ever
be
fond
and
loving
to
you
if
you
will
let
helen
folded
her
to
her
heart
and
kissed
her
wildly
is
in
vain
eva
she
presently
replied
in
a
low
but
firm
tone
can
not
be
if
i
were
to
remain
my
father
would
attempt
to
coerce
me
into
an
act
which
weak
and
erring
as
i
have
been
i
would
die
rather
than
consent
to
perform
farewell
we
shall
meet
again
i
come
to
see
you
helen
she
asked
with
great
earnestness
am
very
sad
and
lonely
at
home
here
and
if
i
could
only
come
at
times
to
see
and
speak
with
you
it
would
make
me
so
will
write
to
you
darling
said
helen
hastily
back
to
your
room
eva
or
you
will
be
missed
and
you
will
be
suspected
of
aiding
my
departure
i
would
spare
you
a
terrifying
and
the
likely
to
result
from
it
besides
dearest
if
i
remain
longer
it
may
prove
the
source
of
the
greatest
unhappiness
to
this
latter
argument
had
its
full
weight
with
evangeline
she
embraced
her
sister
with
ardent
weeping
tenderness
and
with
many
kisses
tore
herself
away
helen
wept
too
and
convulsively
she
stood
motionless
until
after
evangeline
had
with
light
fleeting
step
entered
the
house
and
then
she
prepared
to
hastily
leave
the
garden
by
the
entrance
with
the
impression
that
she
should
never
more
enter
that
house
which
had
been
her
home
from
childhood
she
glided
stealthily
for
a
few
paces
until
she
reached
an
angle
of
the
walk
upon
which
a
shadow
from
the
house
fell
darkly
as
she
entered
the
gloom
hastily
she
ran
into
the
arms
of
a
man
who
had
been
standing
silently
there
and
whom
she
had
not
seen
until
she
found
herself
pressed
vigorously
to
his
breast
dear
miss
grahame
i
have
been
expecting
you
and
i
must
have
a
few
delicious
words
with
you
whispered
the
voice
of
lester
vane
in
her
ear
she
cried
affrightedly
and
by
a
desperate
exertion
she
broke
from
him
and
fled
she
knew
not
where
he
followed
her
swiftly
and
caught
her
as
she
reached
the
thicket
in
which
he
had
felt
convinced
on
his
first
visit
she
met
a
lover
clandestinely
he
seized
her
by
both
wrists
and
held
her
firmly
is
useless
to
struggle
with
me
he
exclaimed
in
an
undertone
can
scream
for
help
if
you
will
and
bring
hither
your
proud
parents
i
shall
not
quit
my
hold
of
you
until
i
resign
you
into
the
custody
of
your
father
who
does
not
contemplate
your
departure
as
he
has
just
informed
lord
elsingham
that
you
will
join
us
in
the
when
he
would
have
the
opportunity
of
further
examining
those
fascinating
attractions
which
he
admired
so
much
at
me
she
cried
with
intense
anguish
acutely
feeling
the
painful
position
in
which
she
stood
and
how
much
the
man
whom
she
now
hated
with
an
intense
loathing
had
become
for
the
moment
the
master
of
the
situation
you
have
listened
quietly
to
what
i
have
to
propose
to
you
he
answered
calmly
can
you
have
to
propose
to
me
but
insults
she
replied
impatiently
do
not
offer
them
as
such
he
answered
with
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulders
you
will
persist
in
so
considering
them
of
course
i
can
not
help
mercy
let
me
depart
you
do
not
know
how
desperate
may
be
the
consequences
of
detaining
me
here
she
cried
entreatingly
to
me
miss
grahame
he
returned
in
a
cold
tone
and
with
slow
enunciation
to
what
i
have
to
say
and
here
in
this
spot
for
i
could
not
have
selected
one
more
fitting
for
my
present
she
cast
her
eyes
round
her
oh
heaven
too
well
she
remembered
it
she
struggled
madly
to
get
free
but
he
held
her
with
a
cruel
grip
and
she
was
compelled
to
pause
is
a
strange
mystery
enshrouding
your
actions
at
this
present
moment
he
continued
between
his
set
teeth
i
know
further
i
believe
that
i
have
penetrated
to
its
inmost
recesses
helen
before
you
set
eyes
upon
me
you
loved
another
met
him
clandestinely
in
this
again
helen
struggled
to
set
herself
free
but
in
vain
was
his
hand
continued
vane
sternly
felled
me
to
the
earth
when
i
accidentally
encountered
him
on
this
very
spot
let
that
pass
helen
you
loved
that
man
yet
you
knowingly
and
deliberately
employed
all
your
stratagems
and
turned
upon
me
the
full
blaze
of
your
charms
to
capture
my
she
shuddered
and
cowered
down
eye
it
was
that
sought
mine
and
when
it
encountered
it
rested
there
your
voice
echoed
mine
your
smile
was
set
playing
for
me
your
hand
rested
on
my
arm
whenever
opportunity
offered
you
were
bland
and
tender
to
me
and
coy
by
turns
i
was
never
in
your
presence
but
you
made
me
conscious
of
it
by
those
peculiar
artifices
by
which
women
attract
men
to
their
side
loving
another
helen
grahame
you
acted
thus
to
is
unmanly
to
taunt
me
thus
she
ejaculated
in
hoarse
quivering
accents
he
echoed
it
not
unmaidenly
in
you
with
your
heart
safely
lodged
in
keeping
to
make
so
desperate
a
venture
for
mine
and
for
what
to
make
it
a
toy
to
break
it
and
cast
it
aside
as
worthless
even
as
a
child
does
a
bauble
he
paused
he
could
hear
her
hysteric
breathing
but
no
pity
was
stirred
in
his
merciless
heart
you
not
young
beautiful
of
proud
birth
ought
you
to
wonder
that
you
succeeded
in
your
design
you
have
won
my
heart
is
false
it
is
false
it
is
basely
untrue
she
gasped
vehemently
swear
to
its
truth
or
why
do
i
care
to
see
or
speak
with
you
again
he
replied
with
animation
repeat
it
helen
grahame
i
love
you
you
exerted
yourself
to
accomplish
that
achievement
and
you
succeeded
having
no
love
to
give
back
in
return
what
atonement
have
you
to
offer
to
me
for
having
destroyed
the
brightest
hope
in
my
life
the
fullness
of
an
arrogant
pride
i
have
erred
she
replied
in
a
choking
tone
am
only
too
deeply
conscious
of
my
failings
and
would
gladly
make
reparation
for
all
the
wrong
i
have
done
if
in
my
is
in
your
power
he
interrupted
excitedly
know
you
can
not
give
me
a
heart
that
has
gone
or
a
love
which
has
been
won
by
another
but
i
know
that
under
peculiar
circumstances
you
are
separated
from
him
from
home
from
the
enjoyment
of
the
position
you
once
held
and
you
can
not
be
happy
as
you
are
now
circumstanced
i
would
make
you
happy
i
would
surround
you
with
all
the
luxuries
of
wealth
i
would
place
in
your
grasp
all
the
pleasures
the
world
can
afford
you
and
only
ask
in
return
your
man
man
you
make
most
barbarous
use
of
your
present
advantage
to
grossly
and
shamefully
insult
me
she
hissed
indignantly
i
in
my
wicked
pride
have
been
guilty
of
the
artifices
with
which
you
charge
me
those
artifices
were
expended
upon
a
barren
rock
upon
which
no
flower
grew
i
tell
you
man
you
had
no
heart
to
lure
and
your
plea
is
as
false
as
your
present
outrage
is
contemptible
release
me
or
i
will
dare
by
my
screams
the
very
consequences
you
have
lester
vane
suddenly
started
as
though
he
heard
sounds
of
some
one
approaching
he
said
in
a
low
tone
you
would
not
be
discovered
be
am
careless
now
of
discovery
unhand
me
wretch
he
still
clutched
her
wrists
and
she
exhausted
by
the
scenes
she
had
that
night
already
gone
through
together
with
her
recent
efforts
to
liberate
herself
was
now
wholly
powerless
he
knew
it
and
availed
himself
of
the
advantage
it
gave
him
unheeding
her
words
he
listened
for
further
sounds
with
breathless
attention
but
whatever
they
might
have
been
they
were
not
repeated
and
he
went
on
speaking
have
resolved
not
to
leave
you
helen
he
said
with
determined
emphasis
i
have
your
promise
to
consent
to
my
proposition
and
an
earnest
that
you
intend
to
keep
your

upon
her
knees

upon
me
let
me
depart
or
i
shall
swoon
she
ejaculated
in
a
feeble
voice
in
mercy
let
me
promise
he
cried
me
give
you
the
best
reason
to
fall
in
with
my
arrangements
the
name
of
him
you
loved
was
hugh

she
leaped
up
you
would
not
have
me
fall
dead
at
your
feet
let
me
go
she
exclaimed
frantically
till
you
hear
from
me
he
answered
scornfully
knowing
the
fellow
to
be
a
beggarly
clerk
to
a
merchant
i
called
at
the
warehouse
to
make
inquiries
respecting
him
and
in
proof
of
the
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
in
his
own
province
was
told
abruptly
that
he
was
dead
had
died
on
his
voyage
out
to
india
and
was
thrown
into
the
helen
uttered
a
faint
scream
and
fell
back
lifeless
the
firm
grip
with
which
lester
vane
yet
held
her
prevented
her
receiving
injury
in
her
fall
when
she
was
lifeless
upon
the
green
sward
he
released
her
hands
repenting
at
the
moment
his
precipitation
he
had
no
time
for
more
he
was
suddenly
seized
by
the
throat
and
dragged
from
the
shadow
into
the
open
space
where
there
was
light
enough
for
him
to
distinguish
features
he
had
seen
once
before
cried
his
assailant
have
met
again
once
before
to
your
discomfiture
this
time
to
the
defeat
of
your
base
villany
beware
the
third
time
it
will
be
fatal
to
you
these
words
forced
between
clenched
teeth
were
growled
in
his
ears
and
then
it
seemed
that
myriads
of
flashes
of
light
dashed
before
his
sight
he
was
hurled
to
the
ground
with
tremendous
violence
and
he
remembered
no
more
the
stranger
bent
tenderly
over
the
prostrate
form
of
helen
raised
her
up
gently
imprinted
a
passionate
kiss
upon
her
cold
lips
and
pressed
her
to
his
breast
mine
only
my
wife
let
me
see
who
will
dare
to
take
her
from
me
now
as
he
muttered
these
words
he
lifted
her
senseless
form
carefully
and
fondly
in
his
arms
just
as
though
she
had
been
a
child
and
he
bore
her
to
the
side
of
the
ornamental
water
where
lay
a
boat
in
this
he
laid
her
gently
down
covered
her
with
a
boat
cloak
and
rowed
swiftly
away
with
his
prize

young
many
a
weary
hour
on
the
night
of
departure
did
lotte
sit
watching
by
her
little
charge
while
it
slumbered
plying
her
needle
in
making
its
clothes
with
which
it
was
very
scantily
provided
ever
and
anon
she
raised
her
eyes
from
her
work
to
gaze
upon
the
sweet
face
of
the
little
hapless
innocent
or
to
listen
to
its
breathing
soft
and
low
fearful
that
it
might
awake
and
weep
and
she
be
unable
to
pacify
it
after
ten
had
chimed
she
began
to
find
the
hours
pass
slowly
and
painfully
still
however
the
child
slept
and
still
she
worked
on
at
length
the
deep
tone
of
the
bell
gave
forth
the
hour
of
one
and
she
became
affrighted
at
absence
her
eyes
ached
painfully
she
had
worked
many
hours
and
had
continued
to
do
so
if
only
to
pass
away
the
lone
long
vigil
she
was
keeping
she
had
been
weeping
too
for
she
was
weak
in
body
and
that
created
a
depression
of
spirits
which
found
relief
only
in
tears
she
was
harrassed
by
strange
fears
and
vague
doubts
why
why
was
helen
so
long
away
what
could
have
happened
some
dreadful
accident
perhaps
she
thought
of
nothing
but
that
for
what
else
would
or
could
keep
a
young
mother
from
her
in
the
very
commencement
of
its
babyhood
she
grew
sick
at
heart
for
if
her
painful
foreboding
proved
only
true
what
would
be
the
result
hour
after
hour
came
and
went
but
though
she
listened
to
every
footfall
as
it
approached
and
believed
until
it
went
past
the
house
that
it
must
be
that
of
her
late
companion
she
was
disappointed
in
every
instance
helen
came
not
once
or
twice
the
little
babe
awoke
and
cried
but
she
knelt
down
by
its
side
laid
her
own
soft
innocent
cheek
close
to
its
little
velvet
face
and
soothed
its
low
fretful
sobbing
again
into
slumber
during
the
long
night
she
was
conscious
of
a
strange
tremulous
motion
in
the
room
it
was
not
that
she
shivered
with
the
cold
or
trembled
from
nervousness
but
the
sensation
was
that
of
vibration
as
though
heavy
waggons
were
perpetually
passing
along
the
street
but
making
no
sound
several
times
her
attention
was
aroused
by
a
loud
clicking
repeated
at
intervals
a
peculiar
unusual
sound
it
was
but
she
heeded
it
little
she
reflected
that
in
the
many
many
nights
she
had
sat
up
to
work
she
had
often
heard
unaccountable
noises
the
blue
dawn
stole
into
the
room
through
the
window
curtains
and
paling
the
feeble
ray
of
her
solitary
candle
found
her
wan
and
haggard
alone
with
the
child
and
now
the
little
creature
needing
nourishment
awoke
and
cried
piteously
and
would
not
be
pacified
lotte
was
greatly
distressed
at
first
and
wept
with
the
child
for
she
knew
not
what
to
do
but
she
remembered
that
it
did
not
become
her
in
the
position
of
trust
in
which
she
was
placed
to
be
faint
of
heart
it
was
necessary
to
be
calm
composed
and
collected
in
order
that
she
might
deliberate
upon
the
best
course
to
pursue
she
paced
the
room
with
the
child
and
presently
remembered
that
upon
an
upper
floor
there
dwelt
a
young
married
woman
whose
husband
a
was
away
engaged
in
his
business
at
a
mansion
in
the
country
this
young
woman
lotte
knew
had
a
child
about
three
months
old
and
to
her
she
resolved
to
go
for
advice
and
assistance
in
her
almost
distracting
dilemma
strange
when
she
tried
to
open
her
it
resisted
her
strongest
efforts
at
first
she
thought
it
was
locked
but
she
perceived
that
at
the
top
it
pressed
against
the
casing
forcibly
with
a
desperate
wrench
she
forced
it
open
and
made
her
way
up
the
stairs
feeling
the
strange
tremulous
vibration
more
than
ever
she
found
the
of
the
young
person
she
sought
much
in
the
same
condition
as
her
own
and
she
perceived
on
effecting
a
forcible
entrance
that
the
tenant
of
the
room
was
hastily
dressing
herself
she
wore
on
her
features
a
terrified
expression
and
when
she
saw
lotte
she
hastily
inquired
what
had
brought
her
there
in
a
few
brief
words
lotte
explained
the
condition
in
which
she
had
been
left
with
the
infant
the
young
woman
with
motherly
instinct
at
once
took
the
child
from
lotte
and
quickly
stilled
its
cries
with
nourishment
but
as
she
did
so
she
said
with
the
same
alarmed
look
in
her
eyes
is
the
matter
with
the
house
house
echoed
lotte
every
little
incident
connected
with
the
sounds
she
had
heard
during
the
night
in
a
moment
flashed
through
her
mind
returned
the
young
woman
seemed
to
have
shaken
and
rocked
in
my
bed
all
night
i
have
hardly
slept
a
wink
until
i
could
bear
it
no
hark
a
low
dull
heavy
rumbling
crash
was
plainly
heard
by
both
the
house
seemed
to
swing
backwards
and
forwards
both
felt
a
frightful
giddiness
seize
them
the
flooring
seemed
to
heave
up
with
them
then
followed
a
dull
heavy
boom
and
the
house
seemed
to
shake
to
the
centre
both
girls
shrieked
for
they
saw
fissures
like
forked
lightning
run
down
the
walls
and
at
the
same
moment
loud
shouts
rose
up
in
the
street
mingled
with
screams
and
cries
for
help
and
then
the
house
though
quieter
began
again
its
tremulous
motion
heaven
gasped
lotte
house
has
fallen
down
and
this
will
fall
too
my
child
cried
the
woman
hardly
able
to
speak
from
a
faintness
which
had
seized
her
us
run
out
into
the
street
it
was
following
a
natural
impulse
which
had
brought
every
one
of
the
inmates
from
their
beds
and
hurried
them
into
the
street
too
lotte
still
holding
the
child
found
time
to
snatch
up
her
mantle
and
bonnet
before
she
followed
the
example
of
the
young
woman
a
large
number
of
persons
had
already
assembled
bricklayers
were
speedily
at
hand
a
strong
body
of
police
were
soon
on
the
spot
and
efforts
were
at
once
commenced
to
clear
away
the
of
the
fallen
house
under
which
many
poor
creatures
were
presumed
to
be
buried
the
house
in
which
lotte
had
resided
and
from
which
she
had
just
escaped
was
one
of
a
block
of
eight
erected
before
the
building
act
came
into
operation
the
wonder
was
not
that
they
should
now
have
come
down
but
that
they
had
not
fallen
before
the
corner
house
in
its
descent
dragged
two
others
with
it
leaving
the
rest
in
so
tottering
a
condition
that
none
of
the
residents
were
allowed
to
return
to
them
men
were
however
appointed
under
the
police
surveyor
to
remove
the
most
dangerous
portions
of
the
quivering
walls
and
the
furniture
in
the
dwellings
as
soon
as
they
were
sufficiently
supported
to
admit
of
men
entering
them
with
safety
lotte
was
thus
once
more
thrown
upon
the
world
under
trying
and
painful
circumstances
worn
out
as
she
was
she
did
not
however
give
way
to
helpless
despair
but
nerved
herself
for
the
task
she
saw
she
should
have
to
undergo
she
returned
to
the
young
woman
and
recovered
child
which
she
pressed
to
her
own
gentle
bosom
and
covered
it
carefully
with
her
mantle
she
then
made
her
way
to
the
police
station
gave
a
general
description
of
her
little
property
to
the
inspector
told
him
she
would
send
a
person
to
fetch
it
and
then
made
her
way
at
once
whither
she
knew
she
should
be
befriended
and
where
she
could
obtain
all
assistance
in
rearing
child
until
helen
came
forward
to
claim
it
if
she
ever
came
at
all
lotte
believed
that
she
knew
true
nature
and
to
know
this
was
to
make
her
convinced
that
scarcely
anything
short
of
death
would
have
detained
her
from
her
child
that
child
born
under
such
strange
mysterious
and
unhappy
circumstances
lotte
it
need
hardly
be
said
directed
her
footsteps
to
the
residence
of
bantom
or
that
she
was
there
warmly
welcomed
but
after
the
first
few
words
of
greeting
she
suddenly
alighted
upon
a
full
comprehension
of
a
startling
difficulty
in
her
position
helen
had
obtained
from
her
a
solemn
promise
not
to
disclose
that
she
had
become
the
mother
of
a
child
unless
with
her
sanction
when
bantom
in
her
fussiness
and
gladness
at
seeing
lotte
drew
aside
her
mantle
to
take
it
off
she
discovered
the
child
heart
she
cried
with
wondrous
surprise
a
blessed
little
babby
then
bantom
turned
her
eyes
upon
lotte
inquiringly
and
on
seeing
her
thin
alabaster
face
she
gave
a
gulp
and
uttered
an
ejaculation
the
instant
the
worthy
humble
creature
gave
vent
thus
to
the
suspicion
that
flashed
through
her
mind
lotte
understood
her
position
it
was
impossible
to
keep
down
a
scarlet
flush
that
covered
her
neck
and
face
or
to
prevent
it
dying
away
and
leaving
her
face
of
a
deathly
hue
or
to
help
feeling
as
if
she
should
sink
down
upon
the
earth
and
die
almost
happy
in
the
notion
that
her
spirit
should
be
so
released
from
this
world
of
care
and
pain
bantom
noticed
the
spasm
which
passed
over
her
features
and
said
nothing
though
she
felt
sorely
sorely
grieved
but
she
removed
cloak
and
bonnet
and
forced
her
gently
in
a
chair
are
ill
child
and
weak
said
the
good
woman
in
a
husky
voice
ought
to
be
out
in
in
lotte
tried
to
speak
but
her
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
my
child
my
child
sobbed
out
bantom
poor
motherless
girl
what
has
happened
tell
me
child
all
i
i
think
harshly
of
you
nor
speak
unkindly
to
you
and
i
may
help
you
i
may
with
help
i
poor
lotte
this
undeserved
suspicion
was
very
hard
to
hear
she
looked
back
through
her
past
life
and
felt
that
she
ought
not
to
have
been
thus
mistrusted
but
she
recollected
that
bantom
knew
little
more
of
her
than
that
she
was
a
young
girl
living
quite
alone
and
was
thus
open
to
temptation
or
to
be
led
astray
it
was
natural
she
should
harbour
such
a
thought
as
that
which
now
evidently
possessed
her
mind
and
however
much
it
might
rankle
in
heart
lotte
forgave
her
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
she
said
bantom
you
wrong
me
this
child
is
not
mine
at
present
a
mystery
surrounds
its
birth
which
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
explain
i
thought
indeed
bantom
that
i
should
not
have
had
even
to
say
so
much
to
you
for
of
all
who
know
me
i
should
suspect
you
of
being
the
last
who
could
or
would
think
so
very
ill
of
bantom
was
now
all
the
other
way
she
was
only
too
delighted
to
catch
at
the
very
smallest
assurance
of
innocence
and
she
over
and
over
again
expressed
her
readiness
and
desire
to
be
of
service
to
her
and
in
truth
she
afforded
her
assistance
she
could
not
have
dispensed
with
inasmuch
as
the
good
lady
had
recently
presented
her
husband
with
a
tenth
blessing
and
she
was
therefore
able
to
take
the
child
of
helen
grahame
and
nourish
it
as
her
own
at
the
expiration
of
a
fortnight
lotte
had
sufficiently
recovered
by
care
and
her
strength
and
by
the
aid
and
help
of
bantom
to
instal
herself
once
more
in
an
apartment
of
her
own
in
a
house
which
by
the
way
she
satisfied
herself
was
strongly
built
and
not
likely
to
tumble
down
as
soon
as
she
took
possession
she
had
also
so
far
recovered
her
position
that
the
persons
by
whom
through
the
instrumentality
of
flora
wilton
she
had
been
formerly
employed
gave
her
again
upon
application
so
much
work
that
she
was
enabled
to
employ
an
assistant
who
could
undertake
the
part
of
wet
nurse
as
well
for
lotte
would
not
part
with
the
custody
of
child
under
any
advice
suggestion
or
proposal
she
had
heard
nothing
of
helen
she
was
wholly
at
a
loss
to
conjecture
what
had
become
of
her
and
she
meditated
one
evening
a
visit
to
her
house
in
the
park
with
a
hope
that
she
might
gain
some
tidings
of
her
with
her
brother
as
yet
she
had
not
communicated
but
she
had
contrived
through
bantom
who
in
his
homely
way
would
perform
any
meed
of
service
for
her
with
the
greatest
cheerfulness
though
he
was
not
altogether
a
safe
agent
to
employ
on
secret
service
to
ascertain
that
he
was
well
though
perplexed
and
grieved
at
her
mysterious
absence
all
this
time
had
she
thought
of
mark
wilton
ah
yes
not
with
any
notion
of
a
ever
occurring
between
them
during
the
vicissitudes
and
trials
of
her
patiently
endured
life
of
toil
because
whenever
such
vision
presented
itself
before
her
she
chased
it
away
as
a
mockery
a
delusion
and
a
snare
no
she
thought
not
of
him
as
a
lover
in
anticipation
she
did
not
even
think
in
her
heart
that
he
looked
upon
her
in
any
other
way
than
in
a
spirit
of
kindness
with
perhaps
more
earnestness
than
men
commonly
look
upon
a
pleasant
female
face
but
she
thought
of
him
as
one
whom
she
would
of
all
men
in
the
world
have
soonest
chosen
to
be
her
their
stations
being
widely
apart
she
knew
or
thought
she
knew
that
an
event
so
instinct
with
happiness
could
never
never
come
to
pass
she
would
sometimes
squeeze
her
hands
together
and
sigh
very
deeply
some
would
say
bitterly
as
she
ejaculated
happy
i
am
to
think
we
do
not
meet
how
very
happy
i
ought
to
be
that
i
do
not
see
him
often
i
should
so
love
him
and
she
who
wins
him
how
beneficent
will
heaven
be
to
one
evening
alone
with
the
child
as
she
sat
bending
over
it
caressingly
and
thinking
thus
mark
wilton
stood
before
her
she
uttered
a
faint
cry
and
rose
to
her
feet
she
knew
not
whether
to
welcome
him
frankly
or
to
wait
until
he
spoke
he
recognised
her
embarrassment
and
betrayed
some
confusion
also
for
he
saw
the
child
upon
her
knee
his
colour
went
and
came
and
his
heart
heat
violently
he
did
not
look
so
pleasantly
at
her
as
before
must
beg
to
be
excused
for
my
intrusion
he
said
in
a
low
grave
tone
come
however
to
prepare
you
for
a
visit
from
your
brother
are
you
prepared
to
face
him
there
was
something
in
his
tone
and
manner
so
harsh
and
changed
from
the
style
in
which
he
had
previously
addressed
her
so
different
indeed
from
the
expression
his
face
wore
when
looking
up
her
eyes
suddenly
encountered
his
beaming
on
her
for
no
other
word
would
fitly
give
their
expression
that
involuntarily
she
felt
hurt
and
indignant
a
reproach
was
implied
she
felt
that
she
had
deserved
no
reproach
at
least
from
him
his
curtness
seemed
to
her
out
of
place
and
if
she
refused
to
think
it
impertinent
she
felt
that
it
was
as
unjust
as
it
appeared
unkind
she
turned
her
clear
intelligent
eyes
upon
him
and
while
a
roseate
hue
spread
itself
over
her
face
she
responded
to
his
words
by
the
monosyllable
uttered
in
a
tone
of
inquiry
again
he
looked
at
the
little
laughing
babe
which
she
held
so
lovingly
in
her
arms
and
his
blood
seemed
to
freeze
in
his
veins
really
he
said
abruptly
not
how
to
address
you
i
suppose
by
the
married
lotte
felt
her
face
and
forehead
burn
as
if
they
were
on
fire
her
usually
mild
eye
glittered
like
a
diamond
really
can
not
see
wilton
she
answered
slightest
necessity
for
your
afflicting
yourself
with
any
supposition
concerning
one
so
humble
as
he
was
nettled
by
her
glance
and
by
the
manner
of
her
speech
is
easy
to
see
he
said
you
have
fled
from
your
brother
to
form
some
connection
of
which
you
were
convinced
beforehand
he
would
not
approve
and
that
you
still
fear
to
face
him
by
striving
to
keep
your
abode
secret
from
him
or
you
are
under
the
command
to
do
so
of
the
base
the
contemptible
the
sneaking
the
the
d
d
scoundrel
who
has
cajoled
you
into
taking
the
most
unhappy
course
you
have
he
looked
round
fiercely
and
spoke
loudly
as
though
he
anticipated
the
individual
he
had
loaded
with
such
strong
epithets
would
step
forth
to
answer
for
himself
lotte
became
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
trembled
in
every
limb
her
lips
quivered
so
that
she
could
not
speak
but
she
pointed
to
the
door
with
a
frantic
gesture
as
if
bidding
him
begone
he
said
with
an
angry
frown
on
his
flushed
brow
shall
not
begone
until
i
have
seen
the
rascal
who
has
so
grossly
deceived
you
he
shall
well
explain
the
motives
which
have
led
him
to
induce
you
to
descend
to
such
unworthy
artifices
almost
shrieked
lotte
as
unconsciously
she
pressed
child
to
her
bosom
an
act
he
noted
almost
with
fury
dare
you
thus
speak
to
me
i
i
mr
wilton
i
would
out
of
the
reverence
in
which
i
hold
your
gentle
sister
for
the
benefits
she
has
conferred
on
me
speak
to
you
with
respect
but
this
outrage
this
attack
upon
me
drives
me
from
myself
i
did
not
expect
to
be
thus
cruelly
insulted
by
by
a
gush
of
tears
checked
further
utterance
and
her
voice
dropped
at
the
last
word
truly
in
her
she
had
never
pictured
his
face
turned
upon
her
with
an
expression
so
harsh
as
that
which
now
it
bore
and
when
in
her
imaginings
his
voice
breathed
its
soft
melodious
accents
in
her
ear
it
had
no
such
tone
as
this
mark
felt
his
breast
aflame
when
he
saw
her
weep
and
heard
the
acknowledgment
implied
in
the
reference
to
himself
he
would
have
given
worlds
even
at
that
moment
to
have
been
enabled
to
have
folded
his
arms
tenderly
round
her
and
kissed
away
those
tears
which
he
had
himself
brought
into
her
sweet
eyes
but
there
was
the
little
child
yet
close
hugged
to
her
bosom
if
she
were
a
wife
he
had
he
felt
been
scandalously
cozened
out
of
a
priceless
treasure
if
she
dare
lay
claim
to
no
such
title
he
could
never
think
of
her
more
unless
to
loathe
her
very
name
he
assumed
a
cold
manner
although
his
breast
was
as
a
seething
caldron
and
recommenced
may
place
madam
what
interpretation
you
please
upon
my
language
and
i
am
equally
at
liberty
to
interpret
your
deny
your
right
to
do
any
such
thing
she
interrupted
vehemently
are
here
unbidden
sir
if
you
bear
a
message
from
my
brother
to
me
i
ask
of
you
only
to
deliver
it
to
me
and
to
leave
me
if
you
have
no
such
message
i
request
you
to
depart
at
once
exclaimed
mark
as
if
to
explain
will
hear
from
you
sir
nothing
more
than
my
words
if
you
have
been
entrusted
with
them
persisted
lotte
indignantly
shall
have
them
said
mark
in
a
freezing
tone
i
imagined
as
a
friend
friend
echoed
lotte
bitterly
friend
roared
mark
with
a
rather
startling
emphasis
forgetting
his
assumed
coldness
loved
and
esteemed
your
sister
sir
as
a
friend
exclaimed
lotte
in
a
tone
of
earnest
feeling
she
bit
her
lips
to
repress
the
sob
that
gushed
up
to
her
throat
you
am
answered
he
exclaimed
in
a
low
tone
as
she
paused
had
a
weak
and
foolish
fancy
that
but
it
is
dissipated
gone
for
ever
i
see
now
i
stand
but
in
the
light
of
a
meddlesome
intruder
and
have
no
title
to
ask
from
you
any
explanation
of
your
mysterious
whatever
said
lotte
firmly
madam
he
returned
in
an
icy
tone
have
but
then
to
say
that
your
brother
having
by
means
he
will
himself
explain
discovered
your
abode
will
be
here
to
night
to
see
lotte
bowed
and
remained
silent
mark
twisted
his
hat
round
and
round
looked
at
the
door
and
gazed
wistfully
at
her
but
she
stood
immoveable
she
pressed
the
infant
to
her
bosom
and
she
never
once
raised
her
eyes
to
his
her
face
was
white
as
marble
yet
he
was
sure
he
never
saw
her
look
so
handsome
so
beautifully
interesting
mark
lingered
could
she
be
a
guilty
creature
it
seemed
impossible
yet
that
child
coupled
with
her
sudden
flight
her
continued
and
inexplicable
absence
what
other
interpretation
could
he
put
upon
her
conduct
he
gave
a
slight
to
clear
his
voice
and
then
said
will
see
your
brother
when
he
comes
this
evening
her
eyelids
slightly
trembled
do
you
ask
that
question
she
asked
sternly
he
returned
almost
fiercely
will
not
come
to
you
if
you
wish
him
not
to
do
so
for
then
he
will
know
that
he
should
lotte
seemed
to
feel
that
she
should
fall
into
an
hysterical
paroxysm
if
this
interview
were
to
be
prolonged
yet
her
pride
would
not
suffer
her
to
yield
or
to
make
an
observation
which
would
take
the
form
of
an
admission
either
for
or
against
herself
shall
be
at
home
she
observed
laconically
is
to
imply
that
he
may
come
or
remain
away
at
his
own
inclining
said
mark
between
his
teeth
she
bowed
her
head
without
reply
he
gave
one
wild
glance
at
her
and
hardened
he
muttered
and
rushed
from
the
room
she
sank
upon
the
sofa
mark
with
furious
haste
made
his
way
to
the
office
of
brother
and
with
a
kind
of
incoherent
burst
of
strange
remarks
informed
him
that
he
had
had
an
interview
with
his
sister
she
say
she
wished
to
see
me
inquired
charley
with
a
full
certainty
of
an
affirmative
reply
returned
mark
shortly
charley
looked
at
him
with
wondering
eyes
she
a
fe
female
a
young
lady
with
her
he
inquired
expecting
that
the
presence
of
helen
grahame
might
have
been
the
occasion
of
her
reservation
returned
mark
in
the
same
voice
had
a
child
in
her
he
strode
abruptly
away
as
he
concluded
charley
staggered
back
a
bullet
through
his
body
could
not
have
inflicted
upon
him
a
greater
shock
a
thousand
conjectures
flashed
through
his
mind
and
he
paced
his
room
in
perturbed
agony
who
could
give
him
an
inkling
of
her
betrayer
for
that
she
had
been
basely
betrayed
he
was
sure
he
could
think
of
no
one
to
aid
him
but
vivian
and
him
he
knew
not
where
to
find
yet
he
did
meet
with
him
and
that
while
on
his
frenzied
way
to
see
his
sister
in
a
few
hurried
agonized
words
he
told
hal
who
was
unacquainted
with
absence
of
his
discovery
of
her
abode
of
visit
and
its
result

said
hal
with
marked
impressiveness
and
a
knitted
brow
know
and
esteem
mark
wilton
also
i
have
occasion
to
do
so
charley
but
he
or
any
man
had
better
think
well
ere
they
utter
one
sentence
or
half
a
word
to
defame
truth
or
purity
in
my
you
not
think
then
shame
charley
by
heaven
i
would
stake
my
life
upon
her
virtue
and
her
innocence
mark
hasty
impetuous
forms
his
conclusions
too
rashly
you
are
about
to
visit
her
judge
for
yourself
there
may
be
some
mystery
hanging
over
her
movements
but
she
can
she
will
explain
all
i
would
hazard
all
i
might
ever
hope
for
in
this
world
that
you
will
prove
her
only
like
golden
ore
the
purer
for
the
fiery
ordeal
she
may
have
had
to
bless
you
hal
for
those
comforting
words
they
have
relieved
my
heart
of
much
bitter
agony
cried
charley
fervidly
responded
hal
shrugging
his
shoulders
you
should
have
had
faith
in
lotte
she
deserves
it
if
ever
one
of
her
sex
did
i
am
on
my
way
to
meet
mark
wilton
and
it
shall
go
hard
but
i
disabuse
his
mind
of
any
false
notions
he
may
have
taken
into
his
charley
wrung
his
hand
heard
that
you
were
going
abroad
hal
is
this
true
he
asked
was
my
intention
he
said
hastily
may
be
necessary
yet
a
singular
event
has
however
occurred
to
detain
me
for
the
present
in
england
and
of
which
i
am
not
at
liberty
now
to
speak
but
you
will
no
doubt
some
day
hear
and
if
you
should
not
well
my
fate
will
be
of
little
consequence
then
to
anybody
least
of
all
to
he
waved
his
hand
hurriedly
and
hastened
away
charley
watched
him
for
a
moment
thoughtfully
and
then
he
proceeded
to
his
quiet
and
humble
lodging
on
reaching
the
house
he
found
the
street
door
ajar
and
he
entered
without
noise
previous
inquiries
had
made
him
acquainted
with
the
room
she
occupied
and
he
stole
up
to
it
silently
her
was
partly
open
and
lie
peeped
in
he
saw
lotte
seated
at
work
upon
the
sofa
at
her
knee
was
a
bassinet
in
which
lay
a
sleeping
child
a
pang
shot
through
his
frame
and
every
limb
quivered
lotte
looked
paler
and
thinner
than
when
last
they
parted
and
she
seemed
to
have
been
weeping
she
did
not
raise
her
eyes
from
her
work
but
her
needle
went
swiftly
and
continuously
he
glided
into
the
room
and
stood
before
her
she
heard
him
not
nor
did
she
see
him
in
a
low
tone
he
said
she
started
rose
up
with
her
face
towards
him
and
remained
motionless
but
she
bent
upon
him
an
intensely
appealing
look
which
seemed
to
ask
him
to
look
down
through
her
eyes
to
her
heart
and
read
her
soul
he
did
gaze
into
their
clear
depths
then
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
child
once
more
he
looked
into
her
luminous
orbs
shining
upon
him
like
stars
and
he
opened
wide
his
arms
dear
sister
he
exclaimed
with
deep
emotion
from
her
bosom
burst
an
hysterical
cry
she
sprang
forward
and
laid
her
head
upon
his
breast
sobbing
as
though
her
poor
sorely
tried
heart
would
break
chapter
first
love
although
i
joy
in
thee
i
have
no
joy
of
this
contract
it
is
too
rash
too
unadvised
too
sudden
too
like
the
lightning
which
doth
cease
to
be
ere
one
can
say
it
lightens
sweet
good
night
this
bud
of
love
by
ripening
breath
may
prove
a
beauteous
flower
when
next
we
meet
good
night
good
night
as
sweet
repose
and
rest
come
to
thy
heart
as
that
within
my
breast
oh
wilt
thou
leave
me
so
unsatisfied
what
satisfaction
canst
thou
have
the
exchange
of
thy
faithful
vow
for
mine
i
gave
thee
mine
before
thou
didst
request
it
shakspere
so
hugh
riversdale
had
returned
home
to
england
how
did
it
come
to
pass
the
paragraph
in
the
correctly
detailed
what
had
happened
to
him
on
his
voyage
out
up
to
the
moment
of
placing
him
insensible
on
board
the
what
followed
may
be
given
in
a
few
words
he
was
borne
to
his
berth
where
he
was
immediately
attended
by
two
or
three
doctors
who
in
addition
to
the
regular
medical
officer
happened
to
be
on
board
on
their
way
out
to
india
he
was
speedily
resuscitated
though
not
restored
to
consciousness
and
eventually
he
became
so
ill
that
he
was
landed
under
advice
at
malta
for
it
was
considered
that
to
prosecute
his
journey
to
india
while
so
prostrated
would
only
be
to
ensure
his
death
here
he
lay
in
a
hospital
hovering
on
the
confines
of
death
in
the
event
of
recovery
the
probabilities
were
great
that
insanity
would
take
during
the
remainder
of
his
future
life
the
place
of
reason
events
however
frequently
falsify
predictions
and
upset
the
most
careful
calculations
a
crisis
in
his
illness
arrived
passed
left
him
miserably
weak
but
with
clear
sentient
reasoning
powers
his
uncle
had
read
the
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
and
having
encountered
it
without
preparation
it
shocked
him
inexpressibly
it
erased
out
of
his
heart
many
hard
cold
and
worldly
conceits
and
maxims
of
which
he
had
made
principles
and
it
placed
gentler
emotions
there
feelings
and
intentions
far
more
in
accordance
with
the
divine
precepts
than
had
ever
before
had
a
place
in
his
bosom
he
had
no
child
had
never
been
married
and
was
enormously
wealthy
is
my
own
flesh
and
blood
he
said
in
communing
with
himself
upon
this
event
will
treat
him
as
my
son
there
is
enough
for
him
and
me
and
for
the
future
we
will
live
happily
together
i
will
go
to
his
mother
at
he
did
so
there
to
learn
that
indisposition
to
go
to
india
and
his
act
of
folly
were
the
consequences
of
love
shall
have
the
girl
if
gold
will
buy
her
he
exclaimed
with
determined
emphasis
riversdale
shook
her
head
but
remained
silent
she
it
was
who
prevailed
upon
by
the
earnest
entreaties
of
hugh
was
at
southampton
to
meet
helen
if
she
had
complied
with
the
request
of
her
son
and
joined
him
there
the
uncle
now
bent
upon
happiness
as
a
project
was
not
to
be
checked
by
despondent
action
but
entered
into
plans
for
its
accomplishment
with
all
the
keenness
of
a
commercial
speculation
he
feared
to
ask
too
much
of
riversdale
because
he
desired
to
hear
nothing
likely
to
check
his
enterprise
for
such
he
made
it
he
therefore
as
a
preliminary
step
despatched
a
messenger
to
bring
hugh
home
he
instructed
him
to
stop
at
malta
and
to
make
inquiries
respecting
him
as
it
was
not
improbable
he
might
have
landed
there
to
recruit
his
strength
ere
he
went
on
to
india
there
were
some
letters
for
hugh
which
had
arrived
after
his
departure
from
london
and
his
uncle
sent
them
by
the
messenger
a
confidential
clerk
in
the
establishment
one
who
was
personally
attached
to
hugh
on
the
arrival
of
the
messenger
at
malta
he
quickly
found
young
riversdale
and
executed
his
mission
with
a
skill
and
a
tact
which
had
the
most
beneficial
influence
on
the
speedy
restoration
of
hugh
to
convalescence
but
what
most
called
the
recently
feeble
powers
into
stronger
action
was
an
extraordinary
letter
which
he
received
from
a
college
friend
who
at
the
edinburgh
university
where
hugh
had
been
educated
was
his
chum
this
friend
destined
for
the
church
was
ordained
before
they
parted
to
seek
his
own
path
in
life
the
letter
ran
thus
dear
friend
hugh
i
have
most
grievously
most
momentously
wronged
you
i
am
aghast
as
i
reflect
upon
what
may
be
the
consequences
of
an
act
intended
only
as
a
foolish
amusement
let
me
explain
and
deal
with
me
afterwards
as
gently
in
your
thoughts
as
you
may
find
it
in
your
heart
to
do
will
remember
at
christmas
last
we
spent
the
holidays
in
the
highlands
we
passed
a
week
snowed
up
at
the
dwelling
of
the
ramsays
at
inverkeale
other
visitors
were
placed
in
the
same
predicament
as
ourselves
among
the
guests
were
the
grahames
whom
you
had
met
before
one
of
that
family
a
girl
of
singular
beauty
of
wild
spirits
as
she
ivas
proud
in
demeanour
attracted
much
of
your
attention
and
you
were
frequently
rallied
upon
the
disposition
you
evinced
for
her
oh
unhappy
circumstance
oh
idle
folly
which
reflects
only
in
the
hour
of
repentance
riversdale
remember
that
in
one
of
the
wild
sallies
of
mirth
in
which
you
to
ere
both
called
upon
to
endure
a
storm
of
raillery
it
was
laughingly
proposed
by
a
mirthful
maiden
present
that
you
should
be
wedded
to
miss
grahame
giving
way
to
the
frantic
merriment
by
which
you
were
both
surrounded
you
assented
and
i
was
called
upon
to
perform
the
ceremony
without
reflecting
upon
my
most
unpardonable
and
wicked
imprudence
i
undertook
the
office
mark
the
terrible
result
marriage
service
was
fully
performed
by
me
an
ordained
priest
i
omitted
no
portion
you
both
made
the
proper
responses
you
placed
a
wedding
ring
obtained
from
a
married
lady
upon
the
finger
of
the
thoughtless
girl
who
confronted
you
and
fulfilled
all
the
requirements
of
the
contract
even
to
the
drawing
up
of
a
certificate
which
both
signed
and
which
i
now
hold
in
my
possession
the
time
it
was
thought
as
much
a
piece
of
idle
play
as
an
acted
charade
alas
it
is
no
such
thing
hugh
riversdale
helen
grahame
is
your
wife
in
the
sight
of
god
you
are
married
and
may
form
no
other
contract
it
is
true
some
legal
forms
were
omitted
but
that
does
not
absolve
you
from
the
consequences
of
a
joke
which
has
become
dread
earnest
i
leave
to
you
the
task
of
communicating
with
miss
grahame
but
if
i
do
not
hear
from
you
on
the
expiration
of
a
week
from
the
date
of
your
receipt
of
this
note
i
shall
communicate
with
grahame
i
was
guilty
of
the
act
of
joining
you
in
jest
but
in
the
eyes
of
heaven
it
was
an
act
of
marriage
earnest
reflection
has
impressed
upon
me
the
imperative
necessity
of
doing
my
utmost
to
prevent
aught
sundering
those
whom
god
hath
the
letter
contained
many
further
expressions
of
sorrow
and
penitence
and
offered
if
hugh
was
still
attached
to
miss
grahame
and
anything
stood
in
the
way
of
their
to
do
his
utmost
to
smoothe
it
away
estimate
marriage
as
a
sacrament
he
said
hold
no
divorce
valid
on
earth
but
the
feelings
of
hugh
riversdale
on
reading
this
communication
may
be
imagined
his
stay
in
malta
was
brief
after
this
on
his
return
to
england
his
uncle
made
him
a
gentleman
that
is
to
say
in
one
acceptation
of
the
term
for
he
invested
for
him
a
very
large
sum
of
money
and
thus
presented
him
with
a
most
handsome
income
conveying
and
securing
it
to
him
and
to
his
heirs
for
ever
because
having
heard
from
him
his
he
was
resolved
he
should
be
in
a
position
when
he
claimed
helen
grahame
which
was
equal
to
her
own
hugh
however
to
his
distraction
found
on
immediate
and
anxious
inquiry
that
helen
had
quitted
her
home
under
somewhat
mysterious
circumstances
and
it
was
not
known
whither
by
any
one
whom
he
had
questioned
he
set
a
close
watch
upon
her
house
and
hunted
in
every
direction
for
her
without
success
until
the
eventful
night
upon
which
she
returned
home
he
had
full
faith
in
the
probability
of
her
in
her
house
he
had
the
most
sanguine
hopes
that
he
should
prevail
upon
her
to
quit
it
and
join
him
never
more
to
part
he
provided
a
boat
and
a
carriage
with
fleet
horses
should
flight
be
necessary
and
we
have
seen
how
he
had
occasion
to
use
them
he
bore
inanimate
form
to
his
own
house
and
placed
her
in
charge
of
his
mother
while
he
went
in
quest
of
medical
assistance
helen
was
aroused
from
her
long
insensibility
to
exhibit
only
raving
delirium
a
violent
attack
of
brain
fever
followed
and
when
the
violence
of
this
had
passed
she
settled
down
into
a
state
of
low
dull
insanity
from
the
moment
hugh
had
taken
her
away
to
the
hour
that
she
recovered
sufficient
strength
to
be
conveyed
to
one
of
the
mildest
parts
of
devonshire
she
had
not
once
recognised
him
nor
uttered
a
sentence
by
which
he
could
form
a
clue
to
her
object
in
leaving
home
or
the
evidently
delicate
state
of
health
in
which
he
found
her
he
was
pained
saddened
almost
on
finding
that
at
the
moment
the
cup
of
bliss
was
unexpectedly
raised
to
his
lips
it
was
likely
to
be
dashed
from
them
either
by
the
continuance
of
her
aberration
of
intellect
or
by
her
early
death
there
were
faint
hopes
that
by
the
recovery
of
her
health
her
mind
might
be
restored
but
those
hopes
were
faint
indeed
and
under
advice
he
determined
to
try
the
effect
of
the
soft
air
of
madeira
so
he
left
england
with
her
it
can
now
be
understood
why
she
did
not
return
to
lotte
to
claim
her
child
in
the
meanwhile
explanations
secret
and
confidential
had
taken
place
between
lotte
and
her
brother
the
former
though
she
religiously
preserved
helen
secret
quite
gave
her
brother
to
understand
that
she
was
able
to
meet
him
without
a
blush
upon
her
cheek
raised
there
by
any
sense
of
a
blot
upon
her
fair
fame
and
he
was
content
to
believe
this
without
pressing
upon
her
any
prying
questions
which
would
have
embarrassed
her
to
answer
she
learned
from
him
however
that
he
had
seen
evangeline
grahame
several
times
he
was
therefore
able
to
inform
her
of
sudden
appearance
at
her
house
of
her
subsequent
disappearance
with
some
strange
man
who
having
felled
lester
vane
to
the
ground
when
he
endeavoured
to
intercept
their
flight
had
borne
her
away
in
spite
of
all
attempts
to
discover
them
they
had
not
been
heard
of
since
lotte
despite
the
aspect
that
conduct
wore
had
faith
in
her
still
she
had
many
opportunities
of
judging
her
nature
during
the
time
that
they
had
lived
together
and
though
she
could
not
help
observing
many
defects
in
her
composition
she
was
able
to
detect
that
they
were
more
the
result
of
a
fostered
pride
and
false
education
than
any
real
failing
or
flaw
in
a
true
nobility
of
spirit
of
course
she
was
unable
to
fathom
the
cause
for
her
absence
and
her
silence
but
she
was
convinced
that
she
should
see
her
again
and
that
too
at
the
earliest
moment
the
mother
could
command
the
opportunity
to
rejoin
her
child
so
she
continued
carefully
to
tend
it
to
cherish
and
fondle
it
as
though
it
were
her
own
what
rosy
cheeks
she
had
what
a
soft
beaming
expression
lighted
up
her
humid
eyes
and
what
a
pretty
smile
curled
her
small
lips
as
she
thought
when
pressing
this
little
creature
to
her
bosom
during
the
first
period
of
its
charge
that
some
day
she
might
have
as
pretty
a
treasure
to
hold
up
to
the
fond
kiss
of
the
man
she
loved
but
since
her
last
interview
with
mark
wilton
that
thought
if
it
presented
itself
was
hastily
dismissed
with
a
tearful
sigh
she
never
expected
to
see
him
more
and
she
consigned
to
the
tomb
of
other
hopes
the
visionary
imaginings
she
had
for
a
time
so
fondly
conjured
up
in
spite
of
the
jeers
of
her
common
sense
respecting
him
yet
he
came
again
to
see
her
as
before
unbidden
and
as
before
unexpectedly
hal
vivian
had
seen
him
and
had
listened
quietly
to
a
violent
and
incoherent
string
of
complaints
observations
reproaches
and
charges
against
lotte
clinton
from
his
lips
and
when
he
had
exhausted
his
subject
he
reasoned
with
him
quietly
he
elicited
from
him
that
he
had
never
made
even
an
advance
to
lotte
beyond
the
limits
of
courtesy
and
that
she
had
therefore
no
right
to
divine
or
to
perceive
that
he
had
formed
a
strong
attachment
for
her
and
that
he
had
neither
claim
to
interfere
in
her
affairs
nor
right
to
utter
one
harsh
epithet
respecting
her
hal
thereupon
told
him
firmly
that
holding
her
in
his
high
esteem
for
he
believed
her
character
to
be
as
noble
as
her
nature
was
pure
he
would
not
suffer
any
one
not
even
his
nearest
relative
or
dearest
friend
to
repeat
in
his
hearing
one
word
defamatory
to
her
good
name
mark
despite
his
own
suspicions
his
uneasy
and
unhappy
forebodings
and
speculations
heard
vivian
speak
thus
confidently
with
inward
satisfaction
and
having
incoherently
assented
to
all
he
advanced
with
some
lingering
misgivings
he
thought
it
perhaps
would
be
as
well
if
he
never
saw
her
more
and
under
that
impression
he
went
direct
to
her
abode
and
again
presented
himself
before
her
he
found
her
at
work
ever
at
work
but
as
his
eye
ran
rapidly
round
the
apartment
he
detected
the
absence
of
the
child
he
cared
not
where
it
was
so
that
it
was
not
where
he
held
an
interview
with
her
lotte
was
indeed
surprised
to
see
him
enter
her
heart
commenced
beating
violently
and
perhaps
her
cheeks
and
lips
turned
a
little
pale
but
she
did
not
betray
any
other
emotion
on
the
contrary
she
was
very
cold
and
distant
in
her
manner
giving
him
somewhat
decidedly
to
understand
that
his
presence
was
an
intrusion
he
bit
his
lips
and
felt
angry
he
thought
she
ought
to
have
been
glad
to
see
him
again
and
he
drew
himself
stiffly
up
all
he
had
arranged
to
say
fled
at
once
from
his
memory
and
he
felt
himself
completely
in
a
false
position
as
he
did
not
speak
and
lotte
thought
she
had
waited
long
enough
for
him
to
commence
she
inquired
of
him
in
a
voice
slightly
tremulous
the
object
of
his
visit
this
she
did
in
such
a
tone
that
it
vibrated
through
his
frame
and
he
replied
instantly
have
felt
miss
clinton
since
our
last
interview
that
i
have
a
duty
to
perform
to
you
i
have
an
apology
to
offer
and
an
acknowledgment
to
make
our
last
meeting
was
very
he
paused
me
ejaculated
lotte
thoughtfully
to
me
he
subjoined
there
was
another
pause
then
he
proceeded
am
impelled
to
say
that
at
our
last
interview
i
by
implication
challenged
you
with
conduct
which
i
have
since
reason
to
believe
was
on
my
part
a
rash
and
hasty
and
hasty
sir
echoed
lotte
excitedly
was
cruelly
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
brightened
eyes
as
she
uttered
those
words
and
he
said
earnestly
miss
clinton
do
but
assure
me
solemnly
that
i
aspersed
you
unjustly
in
my
words
and
in
my
thoughts
you
will
indeed
relieve
a
heavy
burden
from
my
said
lotte
her
voice
once
more
trembling
have
a
sense
of
too
acute
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
you
know
but
little
of
me
i
therefore
forgive
your
harsh
and
unwarranted
impressions
but
i
can
not
and
will
not
stoop
to
defend
a
fair
name
which
never
yet
has
deserved
there
was
a
proud
nobleness
in
her
mien
a
clear
unwavering
expression
of
her
eye
and
as
she
concluded
an
unfaltering
tone
in
her
words
which
instantly
carried
conviction
to
heart
clinton
he
responded
with
considerable
earnestness
believe
you
from
my
soul
i
believe
you
i
do
not
know
how
sufficiently
to
reproach
myself
or
how
urgently
enough
to
plead
to
you
to
pardon
my
ungenerous
and
ignoble
conduct
to
you
when
last
we
met
upon
my
knees
i
will
implore
you
to
forgive
me
for
i
now
feel
keenly
how
wantonly
i
insulted
you
how
inhumanly
i
wronged
lotte
with
a
beaming
face
held
out
her
hand
did
in
truth
wrong
me
she
said
with
a
sweet
smile
the
best
of
us
at
times
form
erroneous
impressions
let
us
no
more
remember
what
has
passed
and
never
speak
of
it
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
heart
and
though
she
struggled
a
little
to
withdraw
it
to
his
lips
and
imprinted
a
passionate
kiss
upon
it
miss
clinton
he
said
when
he
released
her
hand
must
speak
of
it
again
for
at
least
i
must
offer
an
explanation
of
the
cause
of
my
behaviour
or
else
appear
in
your
eyes
little
better
than
an
incomprehensible
oh
no
laughed
lotte
i
am
satisfied
that
you
were
troubled
with
some
strange
hallucination
then
which
has
disappeared
now
and
i
am
quite
i
am
not
he
said
gravely
she
rejoined
in
a
tone
of
inquiry
and
with
some
little
surprise
he
answered
and
then
added
with
ardent
warmth
is
useless
to
disguise
the
true
state
of
my
feelings
towards
you
i
love
you
lotte
i
love
you
passionately
truthfully
and
devotedly
i
he
seemed
for
the
moment
as
though
the
intensity
of
his
feelings
would
choke
him
lotte
fell
back
a
step
and
the
colour
fled
from
her
cheek
all
in
the
room
appeared
to
become
dim
to
her
eyes
and
form
to
grow
hazy
and
indistinct
he
fell
upon
one
knee
before
her
and
caught
her
hand
lotte
he
cried
can
now
understand
how
my
heart
was
rent
asunder
when
i
came
here
hopeful
to
gain
your
heart
and
found
you
as
i
believed
in
the
possession
of
rise
wilton
do
not
kneel
to
me
you
distress
me
indeed
indeed
you
do
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
tone
the
last
word
becoming
inaudible
mark
rose
up
he
saw
that
she
appeared
faint
and
seemed
tottering
it
is
not
wonderful
that
he
should
slide
gently
his
arm
around
that
small
waist
which
never
had
been
lovingly
encircled
by
the
arm
of
man
before
she
was
faint
and
full
of
tears
so
the
arm
remained
where
it
had
been
placed
and
somehow
her
head
rested
upon
his
breast
while
large
glittering
drops
fell
from
her
eyes
to
the
ground
oh
the
bliss
of
that
moment
never
before
in
her
life
had
she
experienced
any
emotion
equalling
that
exquisite
felicity
it
was
natural
that
the
same
impulse
which
drew
lotte
to
breast
should
dictate
to
him
to
hold
back
for
an
instant
that
pretty
head
and
to
press
his
lips
upon
her
forehead
it
was
first
she
broke
from
him
startled
affrighted
ran
like
a
terrified
fawn
to
a
chair
upon
which
she
sank
sobbing
mark
followed
her
and
bent
over
her
he
whispered
gently
in
her
ear
not
weep
my
own
sweet
little
girl
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
in
tears
i
love
you
as
i
have
confessed
to
you
fondly
and
dearly
and
i
would
make
you
my
own
little
wife
if
you
will
have
lotte
still
wept
but
it
was
with
an
intensity
of
happiness
to
which
previously
she
had
been
an
entire
stranger
oh
those
day
dreams
those
visions
of
paradise
in
which
she
had
indulged
to
wake
out
of
only
with
a
sigh
were
they
after
all
to
be
realized
and
should
she
really
and
truly
have
for
her
very
own
that
handsome
manly
fellow
now
pleading
his
suit
in
her
ear
the
vision
was
one
of
happiness
to
her
indeed
but
she
woke
up
from
it
her
common
sense
presented
itself
coldly
and
gravely
before
her
it
held
up
a
mirror
to
her
in
which
she
saw
at
a
glance
their
respective
social
positions
and
she
saw
that
what
she
had
just
heard
with
such
trembling
delight
was
after
all
a
dream
only
to
be
added
to
others
which
had
been
dissipated
she
rose
up
and
turned
her
face
towards
him
bending
upon
him
her
now
timid
gaze
must
not
listen
to
you
she
said
in
a
low
sad
tone
he
cried
in
a
startled
tone
not
you
love
another
lotte
is
that
why
he
asked
excitedly
she
shook
her
head
gently
she
replied
he
uttered
an
audible
sigh
of
relief
is
glad
tidings
he
ejaculated
with
evident
satisfaction
and
added
we
proceed
farther
before
you
say
to
me
aught
which
may
be
unsatisfactory
in
my
ears
let
us
dear
dear
lotte
come
to
a
decided
understanding
with
each
other
i
love
you
oh
so
dearly
you
have
confessed
to
me
you
love
no
other
man
brother
said
lotte
archly
serious
as
she
was
at
heart
she
could
not
forbear
the
observation
he
waved
his
hand
impatiently
lotte
tell
me
do
you
at
least
i
should
say
do
you
think
you
could
be
brought
at
some
future
time
to
love
me
not
ask
me
pray
do
not
said
lotte
seriously
and
earnestly
in
reply
not
he
asked
with
surprise
she
answered
have
gone
too
far
already
for
your
own
peace
and
i
i
wish
you
to
see
what
you
have
overlooked
the
difference
between
your
position
and
difference
lotte
he
asked
almost
sharply
are
well
born
of
a
long
line
of
ancestry
so
your
sister
has
told
me
you
are
now
wealthy
and
will
be
richer
still
i
am
but
a
humble
needlewoman
poor
my
only
dowry
a
pure
name
you
see
i
can
not
be
admitted
into
your
family
or
if
i
were
it
might
be
to
meet
with
disdainful
looks
and
to
hear
perhaps
contemptuous
remarks
which
would
break
my
heart
it
will
therefore
be
better
that
we
should
part
now
i
shall
always
think
of
you
kindly
and
and
she
could
get
no
further
and
placed
her
handkerchief
before
her
eyes
to
conceal
the
emotion
which
the
image
of
parting
with
him
for
ever
created
mark
waved
his
hand
impetuously
and
stamped
his
foot
impatiently
he
said
me
to
be
the
judge
of
what
constitutes
the
difference
in
our
social
position
mine
as
yours
is
the
accident
of
birth
and
in
taking
you
to
my
bosom
your
social
condition
can
have
no
weight
with
me
in
my
hearing
none
will
dare
utter
a
derogatory
word
or
bend
a
haughty
look
at
my
choice
those
who
attempt
it
may
be
wealthy
and
but
they
would
be
so
mean
in
soul
i
would
not
mix
with
them
and
i
should
return
their
contempt
with
interest
i
need
lotte
a
pure
mind
and
a
loving
faithful
heart
to
companion
me
through
life
because
my
future
happiness
will
be
wholly
dependent
upon
those
qualities
i
have
mixed
with
many
grades
of
people
and
lived
through
some
wild
scenes
and
i
am
somewhat
unsettled
in
my
nature
i
require
a
gentle
counsellor
one
fond
enough
of
me
to
make
my
home
to
me
the
centre
of
paradise
on
earth
while
i
endeavour
to
make
her
life
as
free
from
care
and
as
full
of
unalloyed
happiness
as
it
is
possible
for
such
an
one
as
myself
to
accomplish
you
lotte
are
the
pure
and
loving
woman
upon
whom
my
heart
settles
like
the
dove
on
the
ark
mere
worldly
distinctions
i
despise
you
have
centred
in
your
sweet
self
all
i
desire
to
am
very
grateful
to
you
wilton
she
responded
he
interrupted
her
my
name
is
mark
do
call
me
mark
he
exclaimed
earnestly
it
was
strange
to
see
how
his
fond
eyes
brought
the
colour
in
her
cheeks
she
smiled
but
yet
it
was
a
saddened
smile
am
grateful
she
repeated
your
kindness
but
you
have
failed
to
convince
me
that
an
alliance
between
us
will
be
what
is
termed
a
fitting
match
your
father
lotte
he
interposed
answer
me
this
could
you
be
happy
with
me
as
my
wife
irrespective
of
the
considerations
you
suggest
she
hesitated
to
answer
and
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
once
more
he
stole
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
bent
his
lips
to
her
ear
lotte
dearest
do
not
be
cold
or
cruel
to
me
could
you
be
happy
if
you
were
my
wife
she
turned
her
eyes
full
of
tenderness
upon
his
and
in
the
rich
tones
of
a
fall
heart
said
could
indeed
mark
in
truth
i
love
me
lotte
love
you
mark
fondly
tenderly
dearly
very
very
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
ask
no
more
he
replied
with
deep
emotion
will
settle
the
social
distinctions
after
we
are
that
night
before
he
parted
with
her
he
obtained
from
her
a
conditional
assent
to
be
his
the
condition
imposed
by
her
was
that
his
father
and
his
sister
should
give
their
consent
to
the
union
and
receive
her
as
became
the
position
of
the
wife
of
the
eldest
born
of
the
house
mark
placed
the
fulfilment
of
that
condition
in
the
rosiest
light
and
left
her
to
depart
for
home
on
the
following
morning
he
arrived
at
his
destination
at
a
most
critical
moment
in
his
life
chapter
mr
mission
avaunt
and
quit
my
sight
let
the
earth
hide
thee
thy
bones
are
marrowless
thy
blood
is
cold
thou
hast
no
speculation
in
those
eyes
which
thou
dost
glare
with
hence
horrible
shadow
unreal
mockery
hence
you
have
displaced
the
mirth
broke
the
meeting
with
most
disorder
shakspere
it
is
necessary
to
refer
to
the
position
in
which
harry
vivian
was
placed
by
the
conduct
of
returned
son
ejected
with
brutal
coarseness
from
the
establishment
in
clerkenwell
his
presence
at
highbury
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
his
future
was
now
in
his
own
hands
most
men
have
latent
energies
of
these
there
is
a
class
who
can
only
have
them
elicited
by
the
pressure
of
dire
disaster
there
is
another
class
in
whom
they
spring
into
action
at
the
first
call
of
necessity
harry
vivian
was
one
of
the
latter
he
had
money
by
him
harper
had
early
in
life
taught
him
the
advantages
of
spending
less
than
he
received
and
funding
the
residue
this
habit
was
grafted
upon
him
in
no
miserly
spirit
but
that
in
the
most
important
epoch
of
his
life
he
should
be
able
to
determine
the
value
of
living
within
his
income
by
the
inestimable
comfort
enjoyed
by
all
who
are
never
in
debt
one
anxious
deliberation
and
his
course
was
clear
to
him
he
was
gifted
with
remarkable
powers
of
perception
when
he
erred
it
was
by
accident
it
was
never
by
the
failing
of
his
understanding
he
detected
the
right
side
of
a
question
at
the
first
glance
and
though
his
decision
was
not
formed
without
a
careful
consideration
he
rarely
had
occasion
to
ignore
his
first
impression
he
saw
mapped
out
before
him
the
order
events
would
take
if
he
adopted
an
unworthy
clandestine
and
mean
course
with
regard
to
flora
wilton
she
could
be
his
and
she
would
be
without
her
consent
but
dearly
as
he
wished
for
such
a
result
it
would
never
he
felt
be
productive
to
him
or
to
her
of
that
unalloyed
happiness
he
so
ardently
longed
to
enjoy
with
her
he
saw
clearly
enough
the
probable
result
of
straightforward
honourable
and
manly
action
for
no
matter
what
the
pangs
they
might
be
called
upon
to
endure
or
the
each
might
be
compelled
to
make
in
the
interval
the
remainder
of
their
would
be
unclouded
by
a
reflection
that
they
had
in
order
to
achieve
the
hope
nearest
and
dearest
to
their
heart
violated
their
truth
sullied
their
open
sincerity
or
forfeited
their
honour
he
saw
in
their
respective
positions
colonel
mires
and
the
honorable
lester
vane
and
he
examined
their
prospects
as
rival
candidates
for
the
hand
of
flora
wilton
the
former
he
feared
on
no
other
grounds
than
that
a
vehement
and
passionate
nature
might
hurry
him
to
some
deed
of
violence
out
of
his
unbridled
desire
to
make
flora
his
own
to
prevent
such
an
event
he
resolved
should
be
his
especial
duty
lester
vane
he
regarded
as
by
far
his
most
dangerous
rival
and
from
the
first
moment
he
beheld
him
when
he
heard
to
his
dismay
the
warm
greetings
of
old
wilton
accompanied
by
his
pressing
invite
to
his
mansion
he
determined
to
ascertain
as
far
as
possible
his
antecedents
he
saw
that
he
was
handsome
highborn
a
welcomed
guest
evidently
much
struck
by
beauty
and
quite
ready
to
form
an
alliance
with
her
while
flora
under
the
strong
pressure
of
her
earnest
urgings
had
but
small
plea
to
refuse
accepting
his
offer
he
be
unworthy
and
i
can
prove
him
to
be
so
reflected
hal
may
save
flora
from
becoming
the
victim
of
her
unhesitating
sacrifice
of
her
to
a
phantasm
and
to
the
cupidity
of
a
needy
he
did
make
close
and
acute
inquiries
through
a
agent
and
he
had
in
his
possession
a
report
carefully
framed
which
at
the
proper
time
he
intended
to
produce
and
substantiate
in
the
strong
expectation
that
the
utter
discomfiture
of
a
scoundrel
would
be
the
inevitable
consequence
at
the
same
time
though
most
ardently
attached
to
flora
he
had
no
absurdly
romantic
imaginings
in
respect
to
his
own
claims
to
her
hand
nor
did
he
attempt
to
shut
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
return
of
the
younger
harper
coupled
with
the
death
of
his
deeply
lamented
uncle
almost
completely
robbed
him
of
the
small
chance
he
had
previously
possessed
his
first
step
after
the
deliberation
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
was
to
write
at
length
to
flora
to
explain
honestly
and
openly
to
her
the
situation
in
which
circumstances
had
placed
him
he
detailed
how
his
natural
expectations
had
been
abruptly
shattered
and
the
stern
necessity
which
henceforward
would
imperiously
call
upon
him
to
supply
by
the
exercise
of
his
own
skill
and
industry
those
resources
with
which
his
late
uncle
had
so
liberally
and
kindly
intended
to
furnish
him
he
made
a
clean
breast
and
disguised
nothing
but
his
letter
was
not
composed
in
a
complaining
or
whining
spirit
and
while
he
dwelt
upon
his
own
ardent
love
for
her
and
alluded
to
the
tender
acknowledgments
she
had
made
to
him
it
was
rather
with
a
view
to
suggest
to
her
that
the
change
in
his
condition
since
her
admission
of
attachment
left
her
now
free
to
act
in
the
future
disposal
of
her
hand
and
person
this
he
told
her
he
felt
to
be
as
a
matter
of
justice
and
of
right
simply
her
due
but
it
was
also
only
fair
to
himself
to
state
that
he
did
not
abrogate
one
hope
or
aspiration
in
which
she
had
hitherto
held
the
first
place
he
bade
her
be
assured
that
he
looked
into
the
future
firmly
confidently
and
with
unwavering
faith
he
asked
no
promise
from
her
binding
her
to
his
future
fortunes
he
even
said
that
he
would
think
of
her
in
no
angry
spirit
if
after
what
had
recently
occurred
to
himself
she
accepted
the
hand
of
one
her
equal
in
rank
and
wealth
however
deep
might
be
his
sense
of
the
loss
he
should
sustain
and
finally
that
he
should
ever
do
his
utmost
to
prove
himself
worthy
of
her
favourable
opinion
even
as
he
should
strive
by
unabated
to
recover
the
position
from
which
he
had
been
so
unexpectedly
hurled
the
letter
despatched
he
pursued
the
course
he
proposed
for
himself
to
follow
personal
application
to
the
first
manufacturing
goldsmiths
in
london
proved
to
him
that
his
devotion
to
his
art
and
the
success
which
always
attends
a
perseverance
met
its
proper
reward
in
quarters
where
he
believed
himself
unknown
his
skill
in
the
manipulation
and
the
finish
of
his
designs
was
almost
a
byeword
he
was
gratified
beyond
measure
to
find
that
hours
withheld
from
idleness
and
dedicated
to
his
advancement
had
won
for
him
a
name
as
a
sculptor
in
the
precious
metal
earlier
in
life
than
could
have
been
accomplished
by
any
other
means
employment
was
liberally
given
to
him
and
a
high
scale
of
remuneration
awarded
in
payment
so
far
his
affairs
went
well
but
his
hopes
were
but
hopes
coloured
by
a
fervid
and
sanguine
imagination
he
was
unconscious
of
the
wide
gulf
which
separated
him
a
young
journeyman
goldsmith
from
the
daughter
of
the
representative
of
an
ancient
and
wealthy
house
before
his
confident
and
imaginative
eyes
there
did
not
present
itself
that
long
vista
of
years
through
which
if
unaided
he
must
pass
to
achieve
the
position
which
he
himself
felt
it
was
fitting
he
should
hold
before
he
could
in
honesty
and
honour
ask
flora
wilton
to
become
his
wife
he
saw
not
foreshadowed
in
the
task
to
which
it
was
his
intention
to
devote
himself
the
incessant
application
and
trying
toil
essential
to
success
he
counted
not
upon
exhaustion
of
energy
repeated
and
vexing
though
common
disappointments
and
retarding
circumstances
all
to
be
surmounted
before
the
goal
he
longed
for
could
be
reached
he
saw
no
impediment
which
steadfast
faith
and
unwavering
perseverance
might
not
overcome
he
therefore
entered
upon
his
mission
not
only
to
win
wealth
but
to
reap
laurels
with
a
bold
heart
and
a
firm
purpose
keeping
ever
in
his
eyes
as
a
tutelary
spirit
the
beautiful
form
of
flora
wilton
so
that
he
might
ever
be
conscious
of
the
value
of
the
prize
for
which
he
was
contending
and
never
never
grow
or
weary
while
prosecuting
his
labour
of
love
flora
wilton
received
his
letter
she
perused
it
many
times
and
with
no
little
emotion
it
came
to
her
as
a
new
opposition
to
her
hopes
raised
up
in
a
most
unexpected
quarter
and
with
womanly
instinct
she
perceived
the
important
influence
a
knowledge
of
sudden
reducement
to
poverty
would
have
upon
her
aversion
to
a
union
between
them
but
she
was
woman
enough
too
to
feel
that
it
strengthened
her
resistance
to
her
design
she
wept
as
she
considered
that
this
sudden
change
in
his
circumstances
must
afflict
the
high
spirit
of
her
lover
and
she
heartily
wished
that
at
the
moment
she
had
control
of
a
fortune
that
she
might
place
it
at
his
disposal
there
was
no
absolute
engagement
existing
between
them
so
far
it
had
been
a
mutual
springing
out
of
an
accidental
circumstance
but
flora
now
construed
it
into
one
he
been
wealthy
and
of
high
standing
what
has
passed
between
us
might
not
be
considered
actually
binding
on
the
free
action
of
either
she
ruminated
now
misfortune
has
overtaken
him
i
can
not
in
honour
release
him
if
i
wished
i
do
not
wish
to
do
so
no
oh
no
hal
i
love
you
so
very
very
dearly
i
would
sooner
die
now
than
we
should
be
separated
for
ever
and
both
live
she
felt
at
a
loss
what
steps
to
take
in
responding
to
the
contents
of
the
letter
because
she
was
anxious
to
take
the
one
which
should
be
most
cheering
to
him
that
should
not
wound
him
by
condolement
should
express
her
sympathy
and
regret
and
at
the
same
time
assure
him
that
it
should
make
no
difference
in
the
esteem
the
profound
esteem
she
entertained
for
him
she
disliked
the
word
it
was
cold
and
inexpressive
yet
it
was
proper
to
think
it
as
well
as
use
it
she
felt
herself
to
be
in
an
embarrassing
position
her
impulses
suggested
to
her
to
write
a
long
and
loving
letter
to
vivian
but
she
was
conscious
of
other
considerations
which
forbade
her
consulting
only
self
in
the
matter
now
it
happened
about
this
time
that
mark
wilton
made
the
discovery
that
no
inconsiderable
portion
of
his
time
was
occupied
in
conjuring
up
the
face
and
form
of
lotte
clinton
and
in
framing
small
dramas
the
incidents
of
which
were
strikingly
romantic
and
in
which
he
and
she
played
the
principal
parts
for
many
years
path
in
life
had
been
rough
hewn
and
he
had
been
compulsorily
he
could
by
no
means
brook
trammels
he
therefore
acted
as
impulse
directed
never
believing
that
his
father
could
or
ought
to
have
any
further
control
over
him
so
after
making
an
imaginary
better
acquaintance
with
lotte
passing
through
a
number
of
visionary
in
which
the
young
lady
was
supposed
to
display
a
vast
deal
of
fond
confidence
and
to
give
faint
utterance
to
the
most
pleasing
open
confessions
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
he
should
come
to
the
conclusion
that
she
was
precisely
the
person
to
become
mark
wilton
and
precisely
the
person
who
should
become
mark
wilton
he
had
nevertheless
his
misgivings
they
would
obtrude
unwelcome
enough
in
all
conscience
and
did
not
altogether
agree
with
his
proud
free
sense
of
independence
after
the
scene
in
which
hal
vivian
was
denied
an
alliance
with
his
sister
flora
and
forbidden
to
entertain
in
future
any
hope
of
her
hand
he
could
hardly
help
perceiving
that
his
father
would
insist
upon
having
a
voice
respecting
the
admission
of
other
new
members
to
his
family
he
might
in
spite
of
assertion
of
his
right
to
do
as
he
pleased
in
the
grave
and
important
act
of
choosing
a
wife
object
to
receive
a
needle
woman
as
a
even
though
he
had
been
in
humble
circumstances
for
a
time
himself
and
as
was
very
likely
he
would
exhibit
a
very
strong
feeling
in
the
matter
and
deliver
a
no
less
strong
opinion
upon
it
but
though
mark
felt
this
he
determined
not
to
be
guided
by
it
he
had
heard
it
said
that
in
the
dance
of
life
it
was
a
duty
to
choose
his
own
partner
and
he
believed
in
the
truth
of
the
aphorism
at
all
events
he
did
not
want
any
to
perform
that
office
for
him
he
had
funds
of
his
own
independent
of
his
property
and
he
resolved
that
all
things
agreeing
he
would
marry
lotte
in
spite
of
his
opposition
always
presuming
that
opposition
rested
solely
on
considerations
of
her
previous
position
in
life
it
may
be
understood
that
with
these
sentiments
he
sympathised
with
his
sister
and
after
some
communing
with
her
during
which
with
rosy
cheeks
and
downcast
eyes
she
made
frank
acknowledgments
he
undertook
to
proceed
to
london
ostensibly
to
convey
a
message
from
her
to
his
early
friend
harry
vivian
but
really
to
two
birds
with
one
stone
the
other
bird
being
lotte
clinton
though
if
he
attempted
to
kill
her
at
all
the
only
murderous
weapon
he
intended
to
use
would
be
kindness
he
only
wanted
an
excuse
for
a
journey
to
london
and
his
sister
flora
afforded
it
to
him
now
he
was
very
warmly
attached
to
hal
vivian
had
been
friends
in
youth
when
the
brightest
side
of
prosperity
was
turned
towards
hal
vivian
but
that
fact
had
only
seemed
to
render
the
latter
more
generous
and
to
mark
wilton
their
friendship
had
indeed
on
both
sides
been
characterised
by
the
nobler
qualities
of
human
nature
unworldly
unselfish
and
romantic
in
its
constitution
and
framed
of
the
materials
to
render
it
lasting
it
was
not
of
a
kind
to
be
lightly
disturbed
mark
knew
his
sister
to
be
lovely
amiable
and
richly
dowered
but
he
knew
no
man
whom
he
would
sooner
see
her
husband
than
hal
vivian
unaffected
by
the
claims
of
rank
and
station
he
bowed
to
those
of
sterling
worth
embodied
in
high
qualities
of
heart
and
mind
he
believed
the
happiness
of
life
to
be
associated
with
them
and
as
it
was
his
intention
to
appeal
to
them
to
ensure
him
a
passage
to
immortal
life
through
elysian
fields
on
earth
he
was
well
disposed
to
interest
himself
to
bring
about
a
marriage
between
flora
and
hal
even
though
his
father
was
at
present
averse
to
it
he
went
to
london
from
harleydale
with
what
result
has
been
shown
previous
to
his
departure
from
the
hall
lester
vane
with
the
promise
of
an
early
return
had
quitted
it
colonel
mires
was
also
gone
and
nathan
gomer
with
a
few
words
of
condolence
to
flora
couched
in
mysterious
language
had
also
disappeared
from
the
house
and
neighbourhood
so
at
least
both
flora
and
mark
concluded
for
though
there
had
been
no
leavetaking
he
was
no
longer
visible
in
house
or
grounds
when
mark
left
therefore
old
wilton
was
once
more
alone
with
his
daughter
by
tacit
consent
no
allusion
was
made
to
the
subject
of
their
interview
in
the
library
when
they
met
she
was
pale
silent
and
abstracted
he
moody
and
stern
he
spoke
to
her
in
sharp
short
sentences
and
she
answered
him
mostly
in
monosyllables
they
scarcely
met
but
at
meals
he
confining
himself
with
but
few
exceptions
to
his
library
and
she
to
visits
to
the
glen
where
she
had
confessed
to
hal
her
love
for
him
or
to
the
solitude
of
her
own
chamber
that
she
might
think
only
of
him
and
those
deep
eyes
which
he
had
bent
upon
her
so
earnestly
and
so
lovingly
when
last
they
parted
there
were
however
two
arrivals
in
the
vicinity
of
harleydale
after
the
departure
of
mark
in
the
persons
of
colonel
mires
and
chewkle
both
were
bent
on
mischief
the
latter
during
the
little
affair
of
the
benefit
society
in
which
his
personal
liberty
was
at
some
hazard
had
contracted
the
vice
of
hard
drinking
he
was
always
addicted
to
the
that
when
it
passes
the
point
but
it
was
an
occasional
indulgence
only
which
had
a
very
passable
interval
of
sobriety
but
now
he
carried
a
bottle
a
bottle
which
he
filled
as
soon
after
it
was
empty
as
possible
and
emptied
as
soon
after
it
was
filled
with
a
celerity
remarkable
as
an
accomplishment
but
not
as
such
commendable
chewkle
freely
indulging
his
new
habit
on
his
way
to
harleydale
arrived
at
his
destination
upon
the
eve
of
an
attack
of
which
fit
duly
came
off
on
the
first
evening
of
his
arrival
in
the
parlour
of
the
village
inn
in
the
presence
of
a
small
assemblage
of
nightly
frequenters
and
resulted
in
great
damage
to
visitors
and
furniture
chewkle
who
had
been
engaged
for
a
considerable
portion
of
the
evening
in
emptying
glass
after
glass
of
brandy
and
water
suddenly
fastened
a
fiery
eye
upon
a
gaunt
tailor
who
was
employed
in
trying
how
long
he
could
make
a
tumbler
of
gin
and
water
last
in
a
little
while
he
began
to
mutter
inarticulate
words
of
suppressed
rage
presently
he
leaped
to
his
feet
with
an
unearthly
screech
and
made
a
dash
at
the
tailor
the
latter
intensely
horrified
threw
a
summersault
scrambled
under
the
table
and
so
out
at
the
door
a
tremendous
uproar
ensued
everybody
in
an
agony
of
fright
made
an
effort
to
get
out
of
the
doorway
at
the
same
moment
and
a
jam
resulted
chewkle
actively
employed
himself
upon
the
body
of
fugitives
with
his
chair
until
the
centre
was
forced
and
the
two
sides
burst
outwards
leaving
chewkle
in
triumph
to
commit
mad
riot
upon
everything
breakable
within
the
room
until
he
fell
in
horrible
convulsions
upon
the
ground
after
successive
efforts
to
effect
a
breach
through
the
wall
with
his
head
it
was
not
until
he
remained
perfectly
motionless
giving
no
sign
of
life
save
by
a
dreadful
stertorous
breathing
that
it
entered
into
the
head
of
the
frantically
amazed
landlord
to
send
for
a
doctor
upon
the
arrival
of
that
skilled
personage
the
truth
was
revealed
and
chewkle
was
placed
in
bed
and
as
on
examining
his
pockets
a
good
round
sum
was
found
a
nurse
was
provided
to
attend
on
him
the
landlord
upon
considerations
of
safety
as
he
suggested
took
possession
of
the
money
leaving
the
empty
purse
in
pocket
and
did
not
forget
immediately
afterwards
to
take
an
inventory
of
the
damage
done
by
his
infuriated
guest
chewkle
during
his
illness
raved
about
grahame
and
wilton
frequently
acting
as
though
he
had
the
throat
of
the
latter
gentleman
compressed
between
his
hands
and
was
squeezing
life
out
he
called
on
grahame
to
pay
him
well
for
job
and
threatened
unless
he
received
bunce
that
he
would
provide
him
with
a
hempen
collar
at
newgate
all
these
ravings
were
treated
as
such
and
taken
no
heed
of
by
those
who
heard
them
though
they
were
remembered
afterwards
chewkle
after
a
few
days
became
conscious
of
his
position
within
a
week
he
had
a
rough
notion
of
the
havoc
he
had
committed
from
the
landlord
who
dropped
in
to
see
how
he
was
getting
on
the
money
never
does
anyone
any
good
chewkle
reflected
upon
the
bill
he
should
have
to
pay
for
breakage
for
attendance
and
lodging
at
the
inn
for
the
professional
services
and
for
the
extent
of
which
he
could
not
foresee
as
a
principle
he
determined
not
to
pay
a
farthing
for
one
solitary
item
how
to
get
out
of
it
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
he
had
not
been
asked
for
any
money
that
was
a
fact
which
though
singular
was
advantageous
and
cheering
and
he
determined
if
a
proposition
to
pay
as
he
went
on
should
be
made
by
the
landlord
that
he
would
show
him
his
gold
and
silver
but
make
an
excuse
for
not
parting
with
a
shilling
until
he
was
convalescent
in
less
than
a
fortnight
he
felt
himself
to
be
so
the
landlord
seemed
still
and
confiding
most
confiding
and
chewkle
by
his
boasts
and
promises
endeavoured
to
keep
him
so
one
night
chewkle
finding
the
household
buried
in
sleep
rose
silently
and
dressed
himself
he
felt
hastily
in
his
pocket
to
see
whether
his
purse
was
there
and
chuckled
as
he
felt
it
for
he
was
at
the
moment
unconscious
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
by
the
aid
of
the
small
which
burned
in
his
room
he
looked
about
for
portable
articles
of
value
but
found
none
worth
the
taking
leaving
the
light
burning
he
then
stole
to
the
window
which
was
a
lattice
opened
it
and
carefully
got
without
resting
his
toes
on
the
stout
stems
of
an
old
ivy
which
covered
the
walls
he
closed
the
window
after
him
and
descended
with
very
little
noise
to
the
ground
it
was
light
enough
to
see
harleydale
woods
in
the
distance
and
for
them
he
made
swiftly
trusting
to
fortune
for
chances
of
encountering
wilton
alone
he
felt
uneasy
at
the
delay
occasioned
by
his
illness
for
he
knew
that
death
under
all
the
circumstances
which
had
come
to
his
ears
was
of
hourly
importance
to
grahame
he
knew
not
indeed
but
that
the
lapse
of
time
might
have
rendered
his
task
useless
still
he
resolved
to
go
on
and
if
he
encountered
the
old
man
alone
to
address
him
to
elicit
from
him
actual
position
and
then
act
as
circumstances
might
dictate
he
gained
harleydale
woods
without
being
seen
chuckling
at
his
successful
escape
unconscious
in
the
midst
of
the
hilarity
with
which
he
reflected
on
having
done
the
landlord
that
he
had
skilfully
done
himself
colonel
mires
was
at
the
same
moment
of
time
hiding
in
the
woods
located
at
no
great
distance
from
chewkle
his
object
though
baneful
was
of
a
very
different
character
to
that
of
agent
his
passion
for
flora
had
brought
him
to
spend
the
long
nights
watching
at
her
window
and
the
days
in
vain
search
of
her
in
hope
of
meeting
her
alone
at
first
he
had
a
scarcely
defined
purpose
in
this
he
had
a
vague
notion
of
declaring
his
passion
to
her
of
imploring
her
upon
his
knees
even
with
tears
to
grant
to
him
her
coveted
hand
he
conjured
up
promises
he
would
make
to
her
an
offer
to
be
her
devoted
slave
to
scour
the
earth
to
gratify
her
lightest
wish
to
minister
to
her
pleasures
her
caprices
her
comforts
and
secure
to
her
constant
happiness
at
any
to
proffer
indeed
impossibilities
with
unscrupulous
recklessness
unheeding
whether
one
of
these
inflated
propositions
would
or
could
be
realized
so
that
he
induced
her
to
become
his
only
his
these
intangible
impressions
conducted
him
to
the
vicinity
of
dwelling
but
in
the
secrecy
arid
solitude
to
which
he
for
a
time
devoted
himself
he
had
the
opportunity
of
reflection
and
to
separate
the
impossible
from
the
probable
his
situation
he
found
to
be
just
this
he
was
inflamed
with
a
passion
for
a
girl
who
loved
another
and
whose
father
if
opposed
to
his
giving
her
hand
to
the
man
she
loved
would
certainly
be
averse
to
her
bestowing
it
upon
him
especially
as
he
had
himself
selected
for
her
husband
one
of
station
wealth
youth
and
handsome
exterior
it
was
simply
assuring
him
that
he
had
no
chance
of
success
whatever
by
fair
means
had
he
been
in
the
western
provinces
of
india
where
he
was
for
many
years
stationed
he
would
soon
have
settled
the
matter
as
it
was
he
was
in
england
and
abductions
are
not
easy
matters
in
this
country
yet
abduction
seemed
to
be
the
only
course
open
to
him
he
bent
his
energies
to
the
task
of
framing
a
plan
and
he
believed
at
last
that
he
had
succeeded
in
forming
a
scheme
which
was
not
susceptible
of
failure
while
chewkle
was
raving
in
bed
he
quitted
harleydale
to
make
and
perfect
arrangements
and
having
completed
them
he
returned
to
the
wood
to
effect
if
possible
a
secret
interview
with
flora
and
carry
out
his
project
he
had
been
two
days
on
the
watch
when
chewkle
arrived
in
the
wood
from
the
inn
in
the
course
of
that
morning
they
came
during
a
stealthy
stroll
suddenly
face
to
face
instantly
their
eyes
met
each
seemed
to
feel
the
other
was
there
for
an
improper
purpose
sir
exclaimed
chewkle
with
a
playful
nod
the
colonel
eyed
him
sternly
are
you
here
for
he
asked
in
a
sharp
tone
chewkle
bent
a
keen
glance
upon
him
have
as
much
right
here
as
him
after
no
good
thought
he
a
rogue
detects
a
rogue
as
a
detective
does
a
thief
by
the
eye
and
chewkle
after
his
inspection
felt
a
little
more
at
ease
mires
repeated
his
question
tellings
answered
chewkle
putting
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
are
you
here
about
eh
he
inquired
somewhat
impudently
scoundrel
how
dare
you
put
such
a
question
to
me
exclaimed
the
colonel
angrily
returned
chewkle
quickly
only
returned
the
compliment
look
here
mister
i
am
old
on
the
town
and
have
forgotten
more
than
a
great
many
people
will
ever
know
but
i
know
this
that
you
are
up
to
some
dodge
yes
very
good
acting
but
it
natural
enough
to
satisfy
me
that
i
am
wrong
now
i
mind
dropping
to
you
that
i
down
here
on
a
spec
and
if
it
comes
off
right
it
will
be
the
making
of
me
so
you
see
we
had
better
try
and
help
each
other
than
kick
up
a
row
and
bring
about
our
ears
a
swarm
of
people
we
want
to
there
was
something
in
what
chewkle
said
as
well
as
in
his
manner
which
attracted
the
attention
of
colonel
mires
he
saw
before
him
a
fitting
instrument
for
the
commission
of
any
act
of
rascality
and
he
came
promptly
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
better
to
enlist
his
services
than
to
make
an
enemy
of
him
he
therefore
determined
to
fence
with
his
questions
for
a
short
time
before
he
came
to
an
open
understanding
with
him
and
directly
he
proceeded
to
do
this
chewkle
felt
satisfied
and
at
his
ease
he
parried
the
questions
with
the
greatest
ease
and
artfully
contrived
to
extract
an
admission
from
him
which
caused
him
to
say
come
after
young
miss
wilton
have
you
you
found
another
before
you
eh
and
you
want
to
get
hold
of
her
on
the
sly
you
the
colonel
eyed
him
curiously
somewhat
staggered
at
the
observation
and
said
quickly
know
the
fellow
vivian
i
suppose
thought
chewkle
wilton
wilton
he
rubbed
his
chin
presently
he
said
you
mean
harper
the
nevy
do
what
then
presume
you
have
come
down
on
his
business
you
far
out
he
wants
to
get
hold
of
miss
wilton
too
you
this
was
the
merest
surmise
on
the
part
of
chewkle
he
knew
that
harry
vivian
was
acquainted
with
the
wiltons
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
pretty
near
the
truth
am
aware
of
his
insolent
pretensions
as
i
am
of
the
impossibility
of
their
realization
i
presume
as
a
man
of
the
world
that
service
suits
you
best
which
pays
you
conjuring
freelogonist
have
told
you
my
weakness
better
if
he
had
his
fingers
on
my
bumps
that
my
the
service
you
have
undertaken
and
serve
me
tell
me
what
you
receive
and
i
will
double
am
your
humble
chewkle
rubbed
his
hands
with
ecstacy
he
became
a
confirmed
follower
in
the
belief
that
is
better
to
be
born
fortunate
than
all
he
ejaculated
in
a
soliloquy
got
it
i
he
at
once
proceeded
to
tell
colonel
mires
a
host
of
lies
respecting
his
mission
to
flora
improbable
and
exaggerated
as
they
were
the
colonel
in
his
raging
jealousy
and
passion
believed
them
and
readily
responded
to
request
for
an
earnest
of
payment
before
he
took
a
step
in
his
service
as
soon
as
gold
was
once
more
in
his
purse
the
unscrupulous
agent
declared
himself
ready
to
perform
anything
required
of
him
and
the
colonel
drew
him
by
a
circuitous
path
towards
the
narrow
glen
flora
was
accustomed
to
visit
he
pointed
it
out
to
him
and
directed
him
how
he
might
gain
access
to
it
unseen
he
had
hardly
done
so
when
he
clutched
chewkle
by
the
arm
and
pointed
to
the
pathway
leading
to
it
he
exclaimed
heaven
miss
wilton
is
proceeding
there
hasten
by
the
route
i
have
described
to
you
and
when
she
is
seated
steal
suddenly
upon
her
so
as
to
startle
her
then
tell
her
you
are
from
aunt
and
give
her
this
letter
i
know
what
the
result
will
be
she
will
faint
i
will
be
on
the
spot
and
the
rest
is
provided
for
quick
quick
follow
that
path
away
with
you
chewkle
a
little
bewildered
took
the
letter
and
stole
cautiously
to
the
spot
pointed
out
to
him
while
colonel
mires
with
an
agitated
manner
darted
off
in
a
different
direction
chapter
the
abduction
why
man
she
is
mine
own
and
i
as
rich
in
having
such
a
jewel
as
twenty
seas
if
all
their
sand
were
pearl
the
water
nectar
and
the
rocks
pure
gold
shakspere
lester
vane
while
he
indulged
his
appetite
for
profligate
pleasures
or
pursued
with
pertinacity
a
revengeful
purpose
never
lost
sight
of
his
personal
interest
especially
where
that
interest
centred
itself
upon
an
object
awakening
his
selfish
desire
he
had
a
double
motive
in
desiring
to
obtain
the
hand
of
flora
wilton
he
needed
the
income
she
would
bring
with
her
and
he
coveted
her
beautiful
self
he
loved
her
so
far
as
he
could
love
anything
feminine
apart
from
a
lower
emotion
intensely
and
was
in
fact
sufficiently
fascinated
by
her
charms
to
have
married
her
had
she
been
penniless
even
if
he
had
neglected
and
her
afterwards
as
she
was
circumstanced
she
was
a
valuable
prize
for
she
had
beauty
and
riches
too
the
combination
was
something
rare
no
one
comprehended
or
appreciated
that
fact
better
than
himself
how
he
would
be
envied
when
she
was
his
fortune
and
all
he
never
separated
that
consideration
from
the
pictures
his
imagination
sketched
of
the
future
he
dwelt
upon
the
vision
which
saw
him
folding
the
fair
creature
to
his
heart
and
placing
the
fortune
she
brought
to
his
own
credit
at
his
own
what
he
had
learned
and
knew
respecting
hal
vivian
he
treated
lightly
contemptuously
nevertheless
the
figure
of
this
young
would
obtrude
itself
still
he
brushed
the
shadowy
object
from
his
sight
with
an
impatient
sneer
for
he
had
faith
in
his
own
attractions
he
thought
it
impossible
that
a
gentle
creature
so
simple
and
certainly
so
impressionable
as
flora
could
resist
him
as
yet
he
had
not
had
a
chance
to
play
off
upon
her
his
attractions
to
win
her
that
odious
indian
bore
as
he
deemed
mires
with
his
bright
eyes
had
always
during
his
sojourn
at
harleydale
intruded
himself
just
as
he
had
brought
up
his
artillery
of
glances
soft
words
and
tender
and
again
at
the
moment
he
had
devised
an
excellent
plan
for
flinging
his
indian
rival
the
unexpected
presence
of
vivian
and
the
events
it
precipitated
drove
him
from
the
scene
of
sight
out
of
was
a
favourite
axiom
with
him
it
was
one
he
invariably
acted
upon
in
affairs
of
the
heart
unless
as
in
the
present
instance
his
personal
interest
was
identified
with
his
passion
for
the
lady
he
being
thus
banished
from
the
object
of
his
passionate
and
pecuniary
hopes
reflected
that
the
axiom
he
adopted
as
a
principle
might
have
a
similar
influence
upon
one
whom
he
would
rather
have
unconscious
of
the
existence
of
the
proverb
much
less
capable
of
its
application
to
render
such
a
contingency
impossible
he
addressed
a
letter
to
wilton
penned
with
a
full
conviction
that
it
would
be
laid
before
and
perused
by
flora
it
was
well
done
and
admirably
calculated
to
effect
its
object
if
ah
those
love
for
harry
vivian
had
been
of
a
different
complexion
he
commenced
by
regretting
that
any
event
should
have
occasioned
his
premature
departure
from
harleydale
yet
more
did
he
regret
the
circumstances
which
had
happened
because
they
were
of
a
character
to
disturb
the
domestic
peace
of
wilton
and
to
inflict
pain
upon
the
gentle
heart
of
his
most
charming
daughter
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
express
the
effect
which
those
events
had
had
upon
himself
here
he
grew
elaborate
and
diffuse
he
declared
that
he
fully
comprehended
the
position
in
which
flora
stood
with
respect
to
vivian
he
was
aware
he
said
that
the
heart
was
not
at
the
disposal
nor
under
the
control
of
the
will
love
scorned
common
influences
or
restraint
he
was
himself
an
example
of
the
fact
until
now
he
had
not
really
understood
the
difference
between
loving
and
liking
until
now
he
was
not
conscious
how
consummately
predilection
and
admiration
simulated
love
in
nature
this
was
an
incontestable
truth
he
believed
that
it
had
its
place
in
he
had
witnessed
and
keenly
appreciated
the
amiable
sweetness
of
miss
disposition
he
had
discerned
with
pleasure
her
ready
and
generous
gratefulness
for
any
service
tendered
to
her
or
actually
rendered
he
could
therefore
perfectly
understand
the
influence
a
handsome
youth
would
have
upon
her
grateful
sense
of
benefit
received
in
having
saved
her
from
death
in
a
moment
of
frightful
peril
this
generous
gratitude
took
the
form
of
emotion
very
like
love
yet
it
was
not
love
oh
no
love
was
higher
and
holier
in
all
its
attributes
the
emotion
he
had
described
was
not
ineradicable
nay
when
its
real
nature
was
fairly
and
rigorously
examined
its
actual
character
would
be
detected
it
was
no
desire
of
his
that
miss
wilton
should
abate
one
jot
of
her
gratefulness
to
vivian
for
the
daring
act
of
gallantry
by
which
he
had
rescued
her
from
a
most
horrible
death
nay
it
would
be
his
duty
as
well
as
his
pleasure
to
respect
and
to
share
it
even
he
had
no
wish
that
miss
wilton
should
be
denied
the
society
of
vivian
whenever
her
father
approved
his
visits
in
short
he
had
only
one
desire
and
that
was
to
render
her
happiness
now
and
in
the
future
perfect
and
entire
and
he
had
no
fear
of
not
accomplishing
this
although
miss
wilton
were
not
united
with
the
present
object
of
her
choice
more
than
this
indeed
he
said
but
enough
has
been
given
to
show
the
purpose
with
which
his
communication
was
framed
wilton
received
the
epistle
upon
the
morning
of
the
between
colonel
mires
and
chewkle
he
read
it
with
feverish
pleasure
again
and
again
then
he
rang
his
bell
and
bade
the
servant
who
attended
to
request
miss
wilton
to
come
to
him
immediately
in
his
library
flora
with
a
beating
heart
obeyed
the
summons
interviews
with
her
father
in
his
library
of
late
had
not
been
pleasurable
to
her
he
evidently
regarded
her
as
a
rebel
in
captivity
himself
being
the
stern
judge
before
whom
she
was
occasionally
brought
in
order
that
she
might
with
frowns
be
lectured
out
of
her
contumacy
unfortunately
for
the
purpose
he
entertained
nature
was
one
not
to
be
frowned
either
into
or
out
of
anything
upon
which
she
had
decided
a
certain
line
of
conduct
was
the
proper
path
to
pursue
and
when
he
grew
angry
and
wroth
and
styled
her
stubborn
she
felt
an
inward
conviction
that
she
was
not
obstinate
but
firm
in
acting
rightly
on
appearing
before
her
father
he
commanded
rather
than
requested
her
to
be
seated
she
obeyed
and
then
taking
up
lester
letter
he
handed
it
to
her
that
he
said
and
added
authoritatively
she
took
the
letter
apprehensively
but
felt
relieved
when
she
found
the
handwriting
was
unknown
to
her
a
few
glances
made
her
mistress
of
the
name
of
the
writer
and
then
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
her
eyes
would
be
bent
keenly
upon
her
face
and
he
would
read
every
expression
that
her
emotions
raised
during
the
perusal
might
place
there
she
set
her
teeth
and
lips
closely
together
contracted
her
brow
and
read
slowly
on
to
the
end
without
losing
a
word
or
betraying
any
other
sign
than
a
slight
curl
of
the
upper
lip
when
she
had
finished
its
perusal
she
returned
it
to
her
father
without
a
word
he
waited
for
a
minute
expecting
her
to
speak
but
she
continued
silent
a
flush
mounted
to
his
forehead
and
his
brow
loured
answer
have
you
to
make
miss
wilton
he
asked
rather
impetuously
would
rather
be
excused
answering
your
question
sir
she
returned
in
a
low
tone
doubt
you
would
he
responded
promptly
i
require
you
to
answer
letter
is
not
addressed
to
me
she
said
coldly
he
rejoined
sharply
it
makes
most
important
references
to
you
it
aptly
describes
the
situation
in
which
we
are
all
placed
and
appears
to
me
to
be
conceived
in
the
very
noblest
lip
curled
most
expressively
say
in
the
very
noblest
spirit
almost
roared
her
father
yet
so
transparent
as
to
disclose
the
motives
which
originated
and
have
governed
its
composition
she
observed
calmly
what
motives
repeated
old
wilton
excitedly
other
motive
could
vane
have
than
that
of
opening
your
i
had
almost
said
wilfully
eyes
to
your
perverse
error
to
show
you
how
mistaken
you
are
in
the
insane
impression
you
are
fostering
and
cherishing
in
obstinate
opposition
to
the
wish
nearest
and
dearest
to
my
do
not
acknowledge
the
correctness
of
conclusions
in
respect
to
the
influences
by
which
my
conduct
is
controlled
returned
flora
firmly
consider
myself
to
be
the
best
judge
of
the
effect
gallantry
has
produced
upon
my
breath
seemed
taken
away
he
was
something
more
than
astonished
he
was
exasperated
he
struck
the
with
his
fist
shall
not
decline
hand
he
cried
vehemently
that
subject
i
have
made
up
my
i
ejaculated
flora
decisively
he
rose
up
as
these
words
fell
from
her
lips
she
rose
up
too
and
stood
calmly
and
unshrinkingly
before
him
he
looked
into
her
clear
unwavering
eyes
which
bore
his
steadfast
gaze
without
the
smallest
perceptible
tremor
in
the
lid
he
saw
written
there
in
plain
emphatic
language
the
determination
which
would
submit
to
death
rather
than
yield
to
coercion
he
saw
there
the
unquailing
spirit
glowing
as
in
a
garment
of
fire
though
that
eye
still
was
soft
and
seemed
so
gentle
in
its
blue
loveliness
he
gasped
twice
or
thrice
he
did
not
sigh
you
my
daughter
at
length
he
uttered
hoarsely
was
she
replied
he
echoed
in
a
bewildered
tone
we
were
poor
and
struggling
she
continued
you
were
labouring
toiling
for
the
bread
we
ate
you
were
my
father
for
then
you
were
tender
kind
and
thoughtful
in
all
that
related
to
my
welfare
and
to
my
happiness
then
i
was
your
daughter
your
child
your
own
own
she
wiped
the
welling
tears
from
her
eyes
smiled
upon
me
benignly
she
continued
spoke
to
me
in
accents
of
soft
lovingness
and
you
made
my
life
though
poverty
intermixed
with
our
daily
wants
and
wishes
one
of
quiet
happiness
for
you
loved
me
then
and
i
i
adored
she
paused
for
a
moment
he
listened
with
downcast
eyes
she
went
on
our
trials
our
toils
our
sorrows
under
our
one
great
affliction
when
when
my
my
sainted
mother
a
sob
burst
from
her
quivering
lips
the
old
head
bowed
yet
lower
flora
with
an
effort
controlled
her
tears
and
went
on
she
was
taken
from
us
no
sacrifice
you
could
have
asked
of
me
i
would
have
ever
paused
at
to
make
you
happy
i
would
have
compressed
my
heart
till
it
had
been
pulseless
rather
than
have
interposed
my
happiness
between
you
and
your
perfect
content
i
should
have
laid
down
my
life
with
a
cry
of
joy
to
have
seen
you
without
care
this
this
i
would
have
done
at
a
time
when
if
they
would
ever
selfish
considerations
would
most
have
weighed
with
me
for
any
change
out
of
our
miserable
destitution
must
have
been
productive
of
greater
comfort
at
least
the
scene
sir
has
been
changed
the
rags
of
wretchedness
have
been
flung
aside
the
poor
abode
has
sunk
in
charred
ruins
you
are
master
of
lordly
domains
and
revel
in
wealth
and
the
relation
previously
subsisting
between
us
has
changed
also
almost
immediately
after
our
arrival
here
we
ceased
to
be
to
each
other
as
father
and
miss
wilton
that
name
sir
is
more
fitting
from
your
lips
i
dream
cried
wilton
pressing
the
palms
of
his
hands
to
his
temples
sir
she
continued
in
the
same
firm
tone
as
before
are
broad
awake
the
morning
sun
is
now
at
least
shining
upon
your
eyes
you
have
seen
me
always
passive
and
placid
yielding
and
perhaps
even
as
the
writer
of
yon
epistle
has
flattered
me
by
saying
displaying
an
amiable
sweetness
of
disposition
in
poverty
sir
you
were
gentle
yielding
oh
most
amiable
but
there
you
had
an
inner
nature
which
has
developed
itself
here
at
i
too
sir
have
an
inner
nature
it
is
developing
itself
is
indeed
almost
groaned
wilton
and
then
added
sternly
what
end
this
sir
replied
flora
as
decisively
as
before
this
house
on
these
estates
you
are
the
lordly
patrician
lofty
to
me
as
to
the
beater
of
your
game
i
am
received
by
you
addressed
by
you
retire
from
your
presence
as
from
that
of
the
supreme
head
of
the
household
i
not
he
demanded
are
sir
as
such
i
pay
you
homage
she
responded
you
are
my
father
no
less
and
in
that
capacity
you
have
thought
it
proper
to
treat
me
as
a
stranger
would
dispose
of
me
as
a
lord
of
old
would
give
in
marriage
the
daughter
of
one
of
his
serfs
to
a
girl
you
are
insane
he
cried
stamping
his
foot
i
were
sir
i
should
not
see
the
change
in
you
bitter
bitter
alteration
oh
i
have
loved
you
so
dearly
so
truly
so
fondly
when
there
were
no
trappings
and
riches
to
step
in
between
our
loving
hearts
how
i
loathe
this
state
which
freezes
our
affections
into
ceremonious
greetings
how
i
fling
back
miss
wilton
to
your
lips
sir
and
how
gladly
would
i
take
up
poverty
again
to
be
once
more
your
own
darling
she
sank
sobbing
into
a
chair
the
old
man
felt
a
tugging
at
his
he
turned
his
eyes
up
to
encounter
those
of
his
looking
down
upon
him
from
her
portrait
with
a
soft
sad
expression
as
though
to
remind
him
of
her
dying
injunctions
to
cherish
and
make
happy
the
little
helpless
innocent
creatures
she
left
behind
her
he
tottered
rather
than
walked
to
the
side
of
his
daughter
he
placed
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
sweet
child
my
own
there
should
be
no
division
between
us
he
said
in
a
voice
quivering
with
emotion
flora
flung
herself
upon
his
breast
with
a
cry
of
joy
as
the
old
tone
of
voice
greeted
her
ears
and
he
bent
over
her
kissing
her
white
forehead
with
his
trembling
lips
outwardly
there
was
a
reunion
and
inwardly
too
at
least
so
far
as
their
true
attachment
for
each
other
uninfluenced
by
the
particular
cause
of
their
recent
estrangement
existed
flora
had
astonished
her
father
no
wonder
she
had
surprised
herself
the
alteration
in
his
manner
since
his
return
to
harleydale
had
been
so
remarkable
that
while
it
pained
her
it
was
incomprehensible
to
her
there
was
something
so
new
in
his
and
so
bewildering
in
his
grand
patronising
air
that
she
whose
memory
of
former
grandeur
was
but
a
fleeting
dream
and
of
their
recent
humble
condition
exceedingly
vivid
felt
distressed
at
the
splendour
by
which
she
was
surrounded
so
abruptly
and
by
homage
which
she
was
called
upon
to
render
as
well
as
to
receive
she
wished
to
have
been
permitted
to
glide
into
her
new
position
and
not
at
one
bound
spring
from
a
child
of
poverty
into
the
position
of
a
duchess
she
forgot
that
penury
had
been
as
it
were
her
normal
condition
that
the
change
in
her
father
was
a
resumption
of
his
dignity
not
a
new
manner
founded
upon
a
sudden
accession
of
wealth
she
had
been
uncomfortable
in
her
isolation
at
harleydale
for
isolated
she
was
she
had
brooded
over
the
changes
which
had
occurred
and
those
which
threatened
her
she
had
held
and
imaginary
conversations
with
what
result
we
have
seen
her
inner
nature
had
developed
itself
in
one
great
explosion
it
gave
to
both
father
and
daughter
a
lesson
wilton
as
he
embraced
his
daughter
became
conscious
that
her
affectionate
nature
required
something
more
tender
in
the
mode
of
addressing
her
and
in
the
manner
of
acting
towards
her
than
he
had
lately
adopted
he
perceived
that
gentle
fondness
would
gain
always
the
strongest
influence
over
her
and
he
resolved
on
the
instant
to
dispense
with
his
loftiness
in
his
interviews
with
her
and
he
hoped
in
recovering
the
earnest
affection
she
had
always
previously
evinced
to
steal
from
her
a
consent
to
wed
the
man
he
had
selected
for
her
husband
she
too
at
the
moment
had
a
thought
that
with
returning
fondness
her
father
might
be
led
to
see
hal
vivian
with
her
eyes
and
his
strong
opposition
to
their
union
might
be
made
to
pass
away
neither
however
alluded
to
the
subject
both
knew
it
was
not
the
time
yet
each
felt
the
impression
strengthened
that
the
resumption
of
their
fond
relations
would
tend
to
a
result
they
both
wished
to
see
consummated
though
so
different
in
effect
wilton
made
no
further
remark
upon
lester
epistle
nor
did
he
hint
that
he
still
entertained
a
very
high
opinion
of
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
conceived
or
that
it
was
his
intention
to
reply
to
it
and
beg
the
writer
to
come
down
to
harleydale
quietly
when
having
the
field
to
himself
he
might
endeavour
by
gentle
words
and
soft
persuasions
to
induce
flora
to
transfer
her
affection
from
young
vivian
to
him
he
addressed
a
few
kind
words
to
the
yet
tearful
girl
endeavoured
to
chase
away
an
impression
that
his
restoration
to
his
proper
position
lessened
his
natural
affection
for
her
and
dismissed
her
with
a
parental
kiss
bidding
her
come
to
him
again
with
brighter
eyes
and
her
own
sweet
smile
to
cheer
up
the
hours
in
which
they
were
accustomed
to
meet
and
which
their
late
estrangement
had
made
irksome
and
gloomy
to
both
she
quitted
the
library
her
overcharged
heart
much
relieved
she
hastened
to
her
chamber
but
not
to
remain
there
she
quickly
attired
herself
for
she
wished
to
sit
and
think
over
the
events
of
the
morning
and
the
prospects
they
seemed
to
open
up
for
her
at
the
spot
where
hal
had
first
poured
the
passionate
words
of
love
in
her
willing
ears
there
and
there
only
could
she
find
it
in
her
heart
to
sit
and
think
of
him
and
to
fashion
hopes
of
rosy
aspect
and
sigh
forth
tender
aspirations
for
a
union
that
was
to
be
to
her
conception
so
happy
so
very
happy
flora
was
on
her
way
to
the
little
glen
for
this
purpose
when
the
baleful
eye
of
colonel
mires
fell
upon
her
as
she
disappeared
in
the
leafy
opening
chewkle
followed
her
according
to
the
directions
of
his
new
employer
while
the
colonel
hurried
away
to
set
in
action
the
train
of
arrangements
he
had
with
much
cunning
artifice
devised
and
now
sought
to
bring
to
a
successful
issue
chewkle
following
his
instructions
to
the
letter
turned
into
a
shrubby
alley
which
colonel
mires
had
omitted
to
tell
him
to
pass
and
instead
therefore
of
directing
his
steps
to
the
spot
where
flora
was
sitting
he
unconsciously
hurried
towards
the
village
inn
from
which
he
had
clandestinely
bolted
colonel
mires
as
he
had
arranged
appeared
at
the
proper
moment
within
the
glen
but
to
his
vexed
surprise
he
saw
flora
with
upturned
face
sitting
in
a
thoughtful
attitude
and
no
chewkle
there
he
instantly
surmised
that
a
mistake
had
occurred
and
he
would
have
retired
but
flora
heard
his
approaching
step
and
on
seeing
him
she
rose
up
suddenly
with
the
evident
intention
of
hastily
quitting
the
little
solitude
colonel
mires
impulsively
placed
himself
before
her
and
intercepted
her
he
was
conscious
the
moment
had
arrived
for
him
to
effect
his
plan
and
make
her
compulsorily
his
bride
or
resign
her
for
ever
to
the
arms
of
another
his
heart
at
the
bare
thought
of
the
alternative
seemed
to
be
plunged
into
the
centre
of
a
flaming
furnace
and
the
sight
of
her
exquisitely
beautiful
but
certainly
very
much
astonished
features
roused
his
worst
passions
so
as
entirely
to
shut
out
the
suggestions
of
caution
reason
or
justice
me
miss
wilton
he
said
in
a
voice
which
actually
trembled
with
excitement
appearing
thus
abruptly
before
you
as
well
as
for
desiring
to
detain
you
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
make
a
communication
to
you
of
an
important
character
at
least
to
my
future
pardon
in
return
colonel
mires
she
interposed
frigidly
communication
you
may
desire
to
make
to
me
must
be
made
at
the
hall
and
in
presence
of
my
father
miss
wilton
such
would
be
the
proper
mode
i
confess
but
there
are
occasions
which
override
etiquette
and
this
is
one
of
as
colonel
mires
had
always
treated
her
with
a
profound
and
tender
respect
no
fear
of
him
entered
her
mind
she
disliked
him
because
he
had
acted
so
rudely
and
contemptuously
to
hal
and
because
his
attentions
to
herself
had
become
sufficiently
marked
to
be
offensive
to
her
she
would
not
therefore
have
hesitated
to
remain
if
it
had
been
a
mere
question
of
reliance
upon
his
gentlemanly
conduct
but
the
instinct
of
danger
so
quickly
felt
by
women
when
there
is
real
danger
at
hand
raised
in
her
a
desire
to
be
away
from
that
lonely
place
and
without
replying
to
his
observation
she
moved
on
to
depart
once
more
he
stayed
her
by
intercepting
her
progress
me
miss
wilton
he
said
must
hear
her
soft
eye
glittered
an
angry
expression
appeared
upon
her
fair
face
so
lovely
even
in
its
ruffled
aspect
as
to
make
the
heart
of
the
colonel
ache
with
an
intensity
of
passion
mires
she
said
sternly
forget
alike
what
is
due
to
my
position
and
your
miss
wilton
he
answered
rapidly
forget
that
all
everything
in
the
world
in
your
beautiful
presence
you
must
have
seen
long
since
miss
wilton
how
completely
you
have
enslaved
my
heart
how
entirely
my
whole
being
is
absorbed
by
a
devouring
passion
for
you
in
my
words
in
my
looks
my
manner
you
must
have
observed
how
ardently
i
love
you
you
must
perceive
and
comprehend
that
i
can
not
live
without
you
oh
miss
wilton
i
am
aware
your
imagination
has
been
ensnared
by
a
generous
impulse
in
favour
of
another
but
believe
that
he
can
never
would
never
perform
one
tithe
of
the
devotions
i
will
offer
up
at
your
shrine
he
would
not
no
other
being
would
so
constantly
and
unceasingly
worship
you
so
persistently
consult
your
happiness
and
do
so
much
to
secure
it
as
i
for
oh
no
other
can
love
you
with
the
impetuous
which
burns
in
my
breast
for
language
in
this
place
is
an
insult
to
me
colonel
mires
i
demand
to
be
allowed
to
depart
cried
flora
as
soon
as
she
could
recover
from
the
bewilderment
his
torrent
of
passionate
words
occasioned
her
only
ask
miss
wilton
for
one
small
word
tell
me
to
hope
one
kind
look
and
the
displacement
of
that
offended
expression
upon
your
face
by
a
forgiving
smile
for
i
do
nought
in
offence
but
all
in
insist
on
not
being
detained
sir
she
cried
indignantly
must
answer
to
my
father
colonel
mires
for
this
unmanly
she
sprang
past
him
and
was
about
to
rush
from
the
spot
when
chewkle
made
his
appearance
out
of
breath
he
had
been
running
in
his
turn
he
intercepted
her
pardon
he
said
almost
inarticulately
are
miss
wilton
i
am
said
flora
readily
for
even
in
this
man
she
believed
she
should
find
a
protector
from
the
importunities
of
the
colonel
mires
all
right
responded
chewkle
still
panting
been
all
over
the
grounds
arter
you
miss
for
a
very
pertikler
dockyment
to
give
into
your
document
into
my
hands
what
do
you
mean
my
good
man
she
responded
with
surprise
miss
a
letter
he
returned
with
a
kind
of
knowing
nod
colonel
mires
retired
a
few
paces
as
if
animated
by
a
desire
not
to
play
the
part
of
an
eavesdropper
did
you
not
leave
this
communication
at
the
hall
said
flora
with
some
misgiving
take
so
much
trouble
to
find
me
as
i
told
you
miss
i
was
charged
to
give
it
into
your
only
you
knows
harper
of
highbury
you
miss
aunt
to
poor
young
vivian
poor
fellow
poor
fellow
face
blanched
his
last
sentence
sounded
like
the
sudden
boom
of
a
in
her
ear
she
tried
to
speak
but
found
it
impossible
to
articulate
a
word
chewkle
placed
in
her
cold
hand
the
letter
he
had
received
from
colonel
mires
letter
is
from
her
he
said
told
me
to
give
it
to
nobody
but
you
and
i
was
to
bring
back
your
answer
poor
creature
she
is
distressed
she
is
flora
had
scarcely
strength
to
tear
open
the
letter
a
terrible
vision
of
something
dreadful
having
happened
with
which
hal
was
intimately
connected
rose
up
before
her
and
it
was
not
dissipated
by
finding
the
paper
on
which
the
communication
was
written
was
thickly
bordered
with
black
her
trembling
eyes
settled
on
the
characters
traced
by
a
female
hand
she
read
a
few
lines
uttered
an
agonized
suffocating
cry
dropped
the
letter
staggered
back
a
few
steps
and
fell
into
the
ready
arms
of
colonel
mires
lifeless
by
goles
cried
chewkle
man
quick
assist
me
to
bear
her
away
from
here
cried
the
colonel
in
a
state
of
excessive
agitation
not
an
instant
is
to
be
chewkle
complied
and
together
they
bore
her
by
a
narrow
avenue
into
a
copse
and
thence

arched

followed

was
a
very
brief
conference
between
him
and

the
rapid
passing
of
a
sum
of
money
and
then
at
a
signal
from
colonel
mires
who
drew
up
the
overlapping
wooden
blind
the
carriage
was
driven
swiftly
away
a
route
through
byways
having
been
previously
arranged
and
chewkle
was
left
alone
the
commission
agent
looked
at
the
money
he
had
received
with
a
smile
and
then
put
it
carefully
away

poor
game
after
all
he
muttered
with
a
air

of
thing
is
the
paying
game
he
added
with
a
chuckle
he
forgot
that
the
game
had
a
heavy
penalty
attached
to
it
one
indeed
that
he
might
be
called
upon
to
pay

sneaked
back
into

on

was
preparing
to
take
a
walk
alone
to
the
very
place
where

was
hiding

shakspere
mark
wilton
during
his
last
interviews
with
lotte
clinton
and
in
the
intervals
that
occurred
between
them
passed
through
a
severe
trial
of
his
love
all
the
unfavourable
points
in
the
circumstances
revolving
round
lotte
served
instead
of
cooling
the
ardent
flame
kindled
in
his
breast
to
make
it
burn
more
fiercely
they
were
so
many
small
impediments
which
apparently
calculated
to
stop
the
progress
of
his
passion
actually
extended
its
area
and
added
to
its
depth
mark
determined
after
the
last
interview
with
her
to
marry
her
he
made
his
way
down
to
harleydale
absorbed
in
the
purpose
of
bringing
his
father
round
to
his
way
of
thinking
he
expected
a
very
angry
opposition
and
he
left
london
in
a
state
of
preparation
for
it
he
commenced
with
a
fierce
altercation
with
a
quarrelled
with
the
at
the
railway
station
and
with
fiery
eyes
and
spluttering
words
informed
the
guard
of
the
train
that
he
would
report
him
because
that
functionary
refused
to
admit
him
into
a
carriage
already
filled
fortunately
the
compartment
into
which
he
did
defiantly
thrust
himself
had
no
other
passenger
and
he
was
solus
all
the
way
to
the
station
nearest
to
he
consequently
quite
undisturbed
vehemently
argued
the
case
every
inch
of
the
way
with
an
imaginary
obstinate
obdurate
parent
who
was
most
absurdly
hostile
to
his
views
by
the
time
he
reached
harleydale
he
had
exhausted
the
discussion
triumphantly
defeated
the
arguments
of
the
phantom
father
extorted
from
him
a
consent
to
the
union
between
himself
and
lotte
and
had
got
so
far
as
to
hear
the
village
bells
ringing
a
joyous
peal
he
was
awakened
to
the
reality
of
the
case
by
ascending
to
the
library
at
the
hall
and
meeting
his
father
just
as
he
was
issuing
from
it
to
place
himself
unconsciously
within
the
reach
and
power
of
chewkle
mark
impetuous
nature
would
brook
no
delay
in
bringing
the
subject
nearest
to
his
heart
to
an
issue
the
life
he
had
passed
on
the
islands
of
the
south
pacific
and
in
other
wild
regions
amid
unlettered
impulsive
men
had
communicated
to
his
character
much
of
that
hasty
decision
and
impatience
of
delay
peculiar
to
those
who
mix
in
the
exciting
scenes
which
abound
in
the
warm
climes
of
the
tropics
he
could
not
have
endured
to
pass
the
day
patiently
away
dined
with
an
appetite
discoursed
on
different
topics
with
his
father
and
ultimately
parted
with
him
for
the
night
with
a
formal
notice
that
in
the
morning
he
wished
to
confer
with
and
consult
him
upon
an
important
subject
connected
with
his
settlement
in
life
no
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
lotte
clinton
whether
his
father
consented
or
not
and
therefore
the
sooner
he
knew
what
side
his
father
ranged
himself
on
and
adhered
to
the
better
wilton
having
just
parted
with
flora
was
most
complacent
he
too
had
been
indulging
in
imaginary
conversations
and
a
vision
wherein
his
daughter
overpowered
by
his
affectionate
conduct
and
his
honeyed
words
gave
at
his
suggestion
with
graceful
sweetness
her
hand
and
heart
to
the
honorable
lester
vane
as
he
was
mentally
bestowing
his
benediction
upon
the
kneeling
pair
his
eyes
fell
upon
his
son
mark
with
a
face
radiant
with
smiles
and
with
a
lofty
air
which
suited
the
rather
windy
eloquence
in
which
he
indulged
he
exclaimed
my
dear
boy
back
from
the
great
metropolis
so
soon
i
am
glad
to
see
you
none
the
less
because
you
are
wearied
of
its
turmoil
its
driving
rushing
selfish
careering
its
hollowness
and
its
of
the
sort
sir
said
mark
bluntly
and
a
little
eagerly
had
an
object
in
coming
back
certainly
not
one
of
those
sentiments
you
have
suggested
induced
me
to
leave
london
of
which
if
i
must
speak
the
truth
i
am
infinitely
more
fond
than
of
the
country
but
i
see
you
are
going
out
anywhere
particular
mark
returned
wilton
with
a
mild
patronising
manner
for
a
stroll
and
the
air
i
have
not
stirred
abroad
for
some
days
and
pedestrian
exercise
is
necessary
for
true
sir
i
will
accompany
you
if
you
will
allow
me
we
can
talk
in
the
broad
free
fresh
air
as
well
as
beneath
the
carved
roof
of
your
library
said
mark
with
some
little
force
in
his
tone
as
though
urging
a
point
all
my
heart
said
wilton
so
together
they
left
harley
dale
hall
and
pursued
their
way
to
the
woods
where
chewkle
lay
hidden
as
they
sauntered
slowly
across
the
park
the
old
man
replied
to
some
questions
respecting
flora
which
mark
put
to
him
in
so
cheery
a
strain
that
the
latter
augured
favourably
of
his
cause
because
he
perceived
that
a
reconciliation
had
ensued
between
his
sister
and
his
father
and
as
he
had
the
strongest
faith
in
adhesion
to
the
choice
of
her
heart
he
concluded
his
father
had
made
the
necessary
concession
and
that
his
own
path
to
hand
was
from
the
impediments
he
had
conjectured
he
would
place
in
it
he
at
once
cast
about
for
an
opening
to
broach
the
delicate
subject
but
his
father
saved
him
the
trouble
by
plumply
introducing
it
wilton
felt
slightly
hilarious
brightened
hopes
of
his
marriage
assisted
by
the
healthful
fresh
air
playing
round
his
brow
disposed
him
to
be
sprightly
how
perfectly
unconscious
he
was
of
the
bombardment
he
was
about
to
receive
or
of
the
animation
with
which
he
should
return
the
fire
he
threw
the
first
rocket
into
entrenchment
it
was
returned
with
a
live
shell
which
exploded
the
instant
it
reached
faery
fabric
and
demolished
it
with
one
fatal
crash
mark
exclaimed
the
old
man
as
they
went
on
what
is
the
special
object
which
has
brought
you
down
to
harleydale
from
gay
london
something
important
of
course
mark
nodded
with
an
air
of
one
who
is
impatient
to
communicate
some
weighty
affair
old
wilton
chuckled
wife
mark
eh
he
said
in
a
light
jesting
tone
simply
because
it
was
the
most
improbable
thing
that
occurred
to
him
said
mark
with
emphasis
surprised
that
his
father
should
come
to
the
point
of
their
anticipated
discussion
without
being
so
far
as
he
knew
prepared
for
it
at
first
wilton
laughed
for
he
accepted
the
answer
as
one
returned
in
the
same
spirit
as
that
in
which
he
put
the
question
then
it
struck
him
that
there
was
a
remarkable
and
decided
emphasis
in
the
tone
of
the
affirmative
which
mark
had
uttered
he
gave
an
uneasy
glance
at
his
features
he
felt
a
cold
perspiration
steal
slowly
over
him
his
heart
suddenly
leaped
jumped
and
ached
so
painfully
that
he
stopped
what
was
coming
mark
walked
on
thoughtfully
presently
he
missed
his
father
from
his
side
do
you
pause
he
turned
round
and
said
are
not
already
tired
shall
we
go
back
old
wilton
waved
his
hand
impatiently
am
not
tired
he
said
sharply
but
rather
huskily
will
go
on
but
but
i
quite
presume
that
you
understand
my
question
to
you
mark
was
put
jestingly
echoed
mark
but
father
i
am
very
desirous
that
you
should
understand
i
replied
in
serious
exclaimed
wilton
his
visage
contracting
and
wearing
that
hard
expression
which
so
chilled
warm
affection
for
him
remember
the
old
house
in
clerkenwell
where
we
lived
in
a
very
different
state
of
things
to
this
said
mark
and
paused
as
he
pointed
around
him
on
responded
his
father
coldly
that
he
cleared
his
throat
and
raised
his
voice
say
in
that
house
from
whose
burning
ruins
young
vivian
saved
my
sister
your
only
daughter
too
the
document
by
which
alone
you
were
enabled
to
enter
on
the
possession
of
this
property
and
leap
from
destitution
into
prosperity
correct
me
if
i
mistake
he
paused
again
wilton
maintained
a
grim
silence
mark
proceeded
that
house
there
dwelt
a
young
girl
a
tenant
of
yours
saved
also
by
hal
from
the
flames
you
remember
her
father
do
you
not
wilton
bowed
stiffly
how
would
it
be
possible
to
forget
her
charming
face
having
once
seen
it
cried
mark
ardently
said
wilton
in
a
grating
voice
with
difficulty
enunciating
the
word
more
need
i
say
sir
she
is
my
choice
returned
mark
plumply
and
with
a
firm
decision
of
manner
the
expression
upon
his
face
was
not
lost
upon
him
he
saw
the
opposition
brewing
and
he
gathered
his
strength
to
meet
the
storm
a
kind
of
spasmodic
yell
burst
from
his
lips
he
cried
vehemently
deliriously
preposterous
are
opposed
sir
to
my
making
lotte
clinton
my
wife
exclaimed
mark
with
a
falling
brow
echoed
wilton
with
a
sardonic
grin
talk
of
opposition
boy
the
thing
can
not
be
entertained
for
one
what
grounds
asked
mark
firmly
wilton
waved
his
hand
contemptuously
as
though
the
subject
altogether
was
beyond
discussion
mark
was
not
so
to
be
put
off
found
her
honest
sir
exclaimed
mark
as
he
perceived
his
father
declined
to
give
his
reasons
for
so
strongly
objecting
to
her
beggar
gasped
the
old
man
persisted
mark
beggar
screamed
his
father
willing
cheerful
continued
mark
with
stern
emphasis
and
heightened
colour
beggar
reiterated
wilton
foaming
at
the
mouth
intelligent
and
good
shouted
mark
elevating
his
voice
to
a
pitch
which
topped
his
excited
tone
she
all
the
cardinal
virtues
and
the
beauty
of
a
seraph
she
is
still
a
beggar
and
therefore
can
not
be
admitted
into
my
family
to
mingle
with
its
blood
to
take
her
place
by
my
side
as
their
equal
cried
wilton
vehemently
she
is
in
want
i
will
assist
her
cheerfully
gladly
if
she
wishes
to
be
settled
in
life
choosing
some
honest
young
man
her
equal
for
her
i
will
present
her
with
a
dowry
beyond
that
limit
it
is
the
most
insane
folly
to
expect
me
to
i
to
understand
sir
that
virtue
and
truth
industry
purity
and
integrity
weigh
nothing
in
the
scale
when
placed
against
birth
and
station
asked
mark
sternly
such
a
case
as
this
to
which
you
would
apply
it
i
say
certainly
not
the
veriest
may
possess
all
these
qualifications
but
therefore
am
i
to
admit
her
into
my
family
as
my
your
objection
springs
only
from
a
sense
of
worldly
most
refined
sense
after
death
sir
at
the
great
judgment
day
what
will
weigh
against
the
virtues
i
have
named
birth
and
station
cope
with
them
then
mark
spoke
with
startling
emphasis
for
he
wished
that
his
words
should
have
a
strong
effect
upon
his
father
for
an
instant
the
old
man
was
staggered
but
the
next
moment
the
idea
that
he
was
called
upon
to
accept
for
his
bride
a
poor
needlework
girl
banished
the
sharp
impression
suggestion
had
made
and
he
exclaimed
violently
will
not
argue
the
monstrous
proposition
with
you
longer
i
command
you
to
speak
upon
it
in
my
hearing
no
will
settle
it
now
sir
if
you
please
said
mark
in
a
firm
determined
tone
hope
you
quite
overlook
the
fact
in
your
sense
of
your
own
grandeur
that
my
future
happiness
is
involved
in
the
event
we
are
discussing
or
that
i
am
therefore
entitled
to
a
voice
in
the
disposal
of
my
own
person
and
while
you
are
taking
upon
yourself
to
decide
who
shall
not
become
a
member
of
your
family
you
do
not
i
trust
forget
that
your
decision
may
help
to
diminish
its
old
wilton
turned
a
fierce
and
angry
glance
upon
his
son
do
not
forget
that
you
are
my
son
and
while
i
live
dependent
upon
me
he
exclaimed
with
enraged
bitterness
such
a
condition
of
your
affairs
remains
unchanged
i
will
control
such
suicidal
acts
as
you
meditate
i
will
compel
you
to
obey
me
so
long
as
i
am
master
of
your
sir
cried
mark
with
strong
emotion
lesson
of
poverty
and
wretchedness
has
been
lost
upon
you
you
have
passed
through
the
furnace
yet
your
old
dross
clings
to
you
listen
to
me
i
am
not
dependent
upon
you
this
strong
right
arm
and
bounteous
generosity
enabled
me
to
wrest
from
the
bosom
a
sum
which
to
men
with
moderate
wishes
is
an
ample
fortune
this
money
i
brought
to
england
to
lift
you
and
my
sister
out
of
your
beggary
if
you
had
needed
its
aid
you
have
not
required
it
and
it
yet
stands
in
my
name
i
will
henceforth
use
it
for
myself
leaving
you
to
enjoy
what
you
possess
but
taking
care
to
reap
from
my
own
wealth
that
happiness
which
you
so
selfishly
deny
he
turned
to
move
away
but
the
old
man
called
to
him
sharply
mark
what
is
it
you
would
do
mark
faced
round
and
gazed
upon
him
with
steadfast
eyes
with
unfaltering
voice
he
said
lotte
clinton
my
you
at
what
cost
cried
the
old
man
with
inflamed
eyes
and
clenched
hands
favour
and
my
stipend
replied
mark
firmly
sacrifice
the
two
but
i
regain
my
independence
and
take
to
my
heart
the
only
woman
i
shall
ever
have
omitted
one
thing
one
tremendous
item
ejaculated
old
wilton
with
heaving
chest
curse
cried
mark
in
a
clear
firm
tone
will
never
leave
your
lips
sir
i
have
seen
in
my
short
life
that
curses
like
birds
come
home
to
roost
do
not
you
try
the
mark
once
more
turned
to
quit
the
spot
boy
wretch
shrieked
his
father
you
you
will
not
dare
dare
not
marry
the
artful
designing
infamous
creature
who
had
infatuated
cozened
you
you
speak
of
her
use
gentler
terms
sir
fiercely
interrupted
mark
is
entitled
to
the
profoundest
respect
of
the
noblest
man
alive
and
i
will
suffer
no
one
to
breathe
a
contumelious
word
respecting
her
in
my
you
persist
my
bitterest
curse
shall
cling
to
your
footsteps
and
drag
you
down
through
palsying
vice
and
debasing
misery
to
perdition
almost
yelled
wilton
interposed
mark
in
a
loud
tone

until
you
return
to
your
library
there
sir
alone
with
that
exquisitely
truthful
representative
of
my
sainted
mother
sink
upon
your
knees
and
with
your
eyes
bent
on
her
soft
loving
tender
orbs
call
down
your
curse
upon
me
if
you
have
the
heart
to
do
it
farewell
sir
when
we
meet
again
you
shall
yourself
appoint
the
once
more
he
quitted
him
with
a
rapid
step
and
wilton
staggered
almost
senseless
back
against
the
stem
of
a
tree
the
old
man
gasped
for
breath
and
wrung
his
hands
what
was
there
no
condition
in
life
exempt
from
disappointed
hopes
from
harassing
cares
what
did
not
ample
estates
and
a
large
income
secure
uninterrupted
happiness
in
his
dreams
over
his
toiling
labour
in
the
home
at
clerkenwell
memories
of
the
past
and
anticipations
of
the
future
had
built
up
for
him
a
visionary
state
of
untroubled
serenity
should
he
ever
again
resume
the
position
he
had
lost
with
what
pride
he
had
after
his
return
to
harleydale
believed
that
it
was
secured
to
him
where
was
it
now
how
he
had
gloated
over
the
knowledge
that
a
worm
was
eating
up
the
very
heart
of
happiness
lo
a
canker
had
commenced
to
corrode
his
own
was
this
visitation
the
retributive
wrath
of
an
offended
deity
at
his
towering
pride
of
position
and
his
selfish
paternal
despotism
he
felt
his
temples
throb
and
ache
and
his
breast
burn
as
he
tried
to
thrust
back
the
answer
which
sought
to
present
itself
he
folded
his
arms
and
plunged
deeper
into
the
wood
he
dared
not
face
the
portrait
of
his
wife
hanging
in
the
library
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
voice
would
issue
from
those
small
lips
and
demand
of
him
how
he
had
kept
his
promise
given
to
her
in
her
dying
moments
to
do
his
utmost
to
secure
the
happiness
of
his
children
as
he
struck
into
a
a
was
fired
he
uttered
a
cry
of
mortal
agony
and
fell
bleeding
to
the
ground
the
next
instant
a
figure
emerged
from
the
copse
it
proved
to
be
chewkle
he
bent
over
the
prostrate
form
of
wilton
winged
him
arter
all
he
exclaimed
covered
him
too
never
mind
do
the
trick
this
time
you
shall
have
it
through
the
head
and
no
mistake
old
he
pointed
the
muzzle
of
a
revolver
to
the
temple
of
wilton
but
at
the
instant
his
finger
pressed
the
trigger
a
pair
of
powerful
hands
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
dragged
him
back
the
pistol
was
discharged
but
the
bullet
missing
its
destination
buried
itself
in
the
earth
a
foot
from
head
chewkle
uttered
a
yell
of
terror
startled
by
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
upon
him
his
first
impression
was
that
he
had
been
pounced
upon
by
nathan
gomer
and
that
his
were
the
fingers
of
solid
burnished
gold
cold
as
death
which
now
clutched
him
by
the
throat
and
his
heart
beat
violently
but
his
antagonist
was
certainly
taller
and
then
it
flashed
through
the
mind
of
chewkle
that
he
was
in
the
hands
of
one
of
gamekeepers
the
gallows
in
an
atmosphere
of
flame
presented
itself
before
his
eyes
with
a
violent
enormous
exertion
of
strength
under
the
influence
of
a
sudden
and
maddening
excitement
he
flung
off
his
captor
and
faced
him
it
was
no
gamekeeper
no
other
than
young
vivian
chewkle
gave
a
growl
of
rage
and
with
a
fierce
oath
fired
his
pistol
suddenly
at
his
youthful
antagonist
the
ball
grazed
ear
and
caused
him
to
stagger
but
before
chewkle
could
repeat
his
shot
as
he
intended
hal
closed
again
with
him
and
a
deadly
struggle
once
more
commenced
twice
did
chewkle
in
the
fearful
wrestle
between
him
and
hal
contrive
to
fire
off
the
revolver
but
without
success
and
at
length
youth
courage
and
skill
prevailed
over
powers
wasted
by
debauchery
and
his
recent
illness
hal
flung
him
with
violence
to
the
ground
and
kneeling
on
his
chest
twisted
with
a
sudden
wrench
the
pistol
out
of
his
hand
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
and
his
assistant
with
a
couple
of
dogs
came
crashing
through
the
foliage
and
took
part
in
the
proceedings
a
few
hasty
words
from
hal
vivian
and
chewkle
was
raised
to
his
feet
his
arms
were
strongly
bound
behind
him
and
he
was
given
into
the
custody
of
the
a
tall
powerful
fellow
who
with
a
strong
grip
upon
collar
and
some
very
profane
words
in
his
mouth
dragged
him
sullen
and
to
the
in
the
village
hal
vivian
and
the
then
raised
old
wilton
and
bore
him
to
the
hall
still
senseless
and
bleeding
from
the
wound
inflicted
by
the
scoundrel
chewkle
a
medical
man
was
summoned
and
quickly
made
his
appearance
he
examined
his
patient
and
relieved
the
minds
of
those
gathered
round
him
by
informing
them
that
arm
had
been
broken
by
a
bullet
but
there
was
no
immediate
or
probably
real
danger
the
old
man
was
placed
in
his
bed
and
the
doctor
proceeded
to
dress
the
wound
in
the
meantime
flora
wilton
was
sent
for
searched
for
but
the
messenger
after
absence
returned
by
saying
he
could
not
find
her
she
had
been
seen
to
enter
the
little
glen
skirting
the
park
but
she
was
not
there
now
mark
wilton
too
had
not
returned
to
the
hall
he
had
been
observed
to
hurry
away
towards
the
railway
station
as
if
on
his
way
back
to
london
young
vivian
heard
with
a
grave
and
anxious
face
that
flora
was
nowhere
to
be
found
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
old
wilton
was
in
charge
of
persons
who
would
pay
him
every
attention
and
nurse
him
with
care
he
left
his
name
and
address
in
the
charge
of
the
housekeeper
proceeded
to
the
and
there
made
a
statement
fixing
the
crime
of
the
attempted
murder
of
wilton
on
chewke
he
then
hurried
to
a
cottage
in
the
village
where
a
paper
was
given
to
him
by
an
old
woman
and
having
perused
it
with
no
little
excitement
he
ran
to
the
village
inn
where
a
sound
serviceable
and
swift
horse
was
ready
saddled
awaiting
his
commands
he
had
him
brought
out
and
after
a
few
words
to
the
landlord
he
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
clapping
spurs
to
the
animal
gallopped
away
as
if
engaged
upon
a
mission
of
life
and
death
in
the
meanwhile
mark
wilton
with
a
mind
much
perturbed
and
intent
on
rash
proceedings
hastened
to
the
railway
station
without
again
entering
his
house
even
to
see
his
sister
it
happened
that
on
reaching
it
before
there
was
time
to
reason
or
for
his
thoughts
to
cool
a
train
for
london
drew
up
at
the
station
he
entered
it
and
was
borne
swiftly
from
harleydale
having
no
knowledge
or
conception
of
the
act
of
chewkle
the
condition
in
which
it
placed
his
father
or
of
what
had
happened
to
his
sister
that
same
evening
he
presented
himself
before
lotte
clinton
she
was
not
a
little
astonished
to
see
him
he
had
prepared
her
for
a
longer
separation
but
one
glance
at
his
handsome
and
expressive
face
informed
her
that
something
had
happened
unfavourable
to
his
wishes
she
did
not
for
an
instant
assume
that
he
had
been
to
harleydale
but
she
rapidly
concluded
that
some
event
had
arisen
which
had
shown
him
the
disparity
of
their
positions
and
he
had
now
come
to
break
off
the
match
he
had
so
hurriedly
and
so
impetuously
desired
to
form
a
feeling
of
pain
and
disappointment
gave
her
a
sudden
heartache
but
she
would
not
let
her
emotion
become
visible
for
fear
that
it
might
deepen
the
gloom
already
heavy
on
his
brow
mark
laid
down
his
hat
and
silently
gazed
in
inquiring
eyes
then
he
said
am
soon
back
you
see
you
have
not
been
to
harleydale
she
exclaimed
but
i
have
he
replied
have
seen
my
father
too
and
have
fully
discussed
with
him
our
intended
lotte
looked
at
him
with
a
sad
and
serious
expression
has
forbidden
it
she
exclaimed
with
a
countenance
which
grew
gradually
pale
in
spite
of
her
effort
to
control
her
emotion
it
echoed
mark
evasively
has
not
the
power
to
forbid
it
i
am
my
own
master
lotte
and
am
independent
of
mark
do
not
let
there
be
any
reserves
or
concealments
between
us

me
know
the
truth
she
urged
i
am
not
afraid
to
hear
it
if
you
will
only
speak
you
lotte
responded
mark
am
desirous
of
speaking
and
acting
always
only
do
believe
it
she
exclaimed
earnestly
he
took
both
her
hands
in
his
and
pressed
them
i
do
other
he
said
with
emphasis
your
face
from
me
and
speak
to
me
never
she
returned
the
pressure
of
his
hands
then
she
said
to
him
with
downcast
eyes
and
a
slightly
lowered
tone
have
seen
your
father
mark
and
you
have
told
him
how
much
you
have
honoured
me
in
selecting
me
to
be
your
much
i
am
honoured
by
your
consent
to
have
me
my
sweet
lotte
interposed
mark
almost
fiercely
lotte
i
told
him
all
i
told
him
that
my
heart
and
happiness
were
bound
up
in
you
that
if
i
did
not
have
you
neither
wealth
nor
station
would
ever
compensate
me
for
your
loss
that
in
fact
they
would
only
heighten
my
anguish
and
unhappiness
so
i
had
determined
to
marry
you
having
your
consent
and
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
so
in
solemn
truth
and
honour
i
have
and
here
i
am
lotte

him
steadfastly
in
the
face

his
eyes

he
exclaimed
evasively

happiness

you
love
me

equally
centred
in
me

and
happiness
and
some
day
i
shall
be
as
wealthy
as

father
now

with
each
other
and
for

little

every
plan

and

peaceful

mark
what
said
wilton
persisted
lotte
looking
grave
and
even
sad
is
an
old
man
lotte
and
obstinate
replied
mark
with
some
little
vehemence
is
selfish

arrogant
upstart
lotte
raised
up
her
soft
white
hand
to
his
mouth
father
she
said
your
so
lotte
yet
he
too
should
remember
that
i
am
his
son
exclaimed
mark
with
some
excitement
son
lotte
not
his
serf
his
slave
his
dog
he
should
recollect
lotte
that
my
happiness
is
of
as
much
importance
to
me
as
pride
of
position
to
him
and
he
should
not
overlook
the
fact
that
i
care
a
that
i
care
he
snapped
his
fingers
be
great
and
grande
if
i
am
to
be
unhappy
in
my
am
to
understand
by
this
said
lotte
very
calmly
though
sadly
he
has
refused
to
give
his
consent
to
receive
me
into
his
family
as
your
wife
you
will
not
trifle
with
my
feelings
mark
on
this
point
i
am
mark
remained
silent
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
softly
me
mark
she
said
gently
he
looked
into
her
soft
appealing
eyes
he
passed
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
will
do
or
say
aught
you
wish
me
lotte
but
do
not
ask
me
to
wound
your
feelings
he
said
in
a
low
earnest
tone
it
will
pain
me
so
much
not
to
know
the
truth
for
you
know
mark
i
may
conjecture
much
that
was
never
said
she
responded
adding
me
did
he
not
decline
to
receive
me
as
his
mark
set
his
teeth
in
an
almost
inaudible
voice
after
some
hesitation
he
replied
objection
mark
fear
not
for
me
my
bruised
heart
has
been
too
much
accustomed
to
such
trials
to
faint
under
learning
all
he
could
say
of
can
not
repeat
his
words
cried
mark
with
a
burst
of
feeling
lotte
still
urged
him
is
needful
mark
indeed
that
i
should
know
she
said
exclaimed
mark
taking
her
hand
and
pressing
it
passionately
to
his
lips
the
words
i
may
repeat
have
had
and
never
can
have
any
influence
on
that
i
am
sure
she
observed
objection
was
that
you
were
poor
said
lotte
as
he
added
mark
as
though
the
words
scorched
his
throat
while
finding
utterance
a
flush
of
scarlet
spread
itself
over
features
she
threw
up
her
head
with
a
haughty
and
indignant
air
and
her
short
upper
lip
trembled
with
an
expression
of
offended
pride
she
was
about
to
utter
a
hasty
reply
but
she
checked
herself
disengaged
herself
from
encircling
arms
and
walked
in
silence
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
she
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
for
a
minute
her
whole
frame
seemed
convulsed
mark
watched
her
with
eyes
by
scalding
tears
and
it
was
only
the
endeavour
to
recover
the
power
of
speaking
clearly
that
prevented
him
at
once
catching
her
in
his
arms
bid
her
banish
from
her
mind
all
she
had
heard
and
to
consent
in
spite
of
what
his
father
had
said
to
become
his
bride
at
the
earliest
moment
possible
he
knew
not
lotte
yet
she
was
the
first
to
recover
calmness
and
she
returned
to
where
he
was
standing
understand
your
weakness
by
my
she
said
pardon
the
pain
it
has
given
me
for
i
am
reminded
by
my
own
poor
indignation
at
being
termed
how
natural
his
anger
would
be
at
the
thought
of
one
so
humble
as
myself
being
elevated
to
his
side
and
made
a
member
of
his
family
in
opposition
to
all
those
prejudices
of
which
station
and
affluence
are
so
fruitful
well
heaven
knows
best
i
bow
to
its
decree
the
dream
only
too
glorious
to
be
realised
was
sweet
very
very
sweet
while
it
lasted
and
i
wake
once
more
to
be
plain
lotte
clinton
the
be
my
wife
lotte
cried
mark
passionately
wife
my
adored
my
honoured
wife
lotte
mark
she
said
in
pleading
earnestness
our
remember
lotte
he
said
i
am
human
that
i
have
my
passions
and
my
failings
as
others
of
my
sex
but
i
hope
i
have
too
that
broader
view
of
life
that
makes
virtue
and
worth
the
true
nobility
and
that
i
can
appreciate
it
when
it
comes
before
me
as
it
has
in
you
lotte
i
have
all
my
life
at
least
so
long
as
i
remember
lived
in
a
sphere
in
which
worth
and
amiability
and
virtue
shine
most
because
they
are
surrounded
by
the
worst
temptations
to
which
the
higher
qualifications
can
be
subjected
and
when
they
maintain
themselves
unsullied
they
are
in
my
eyes
the
true
and
most
fitting
emblems
of
a
real
nobility
all
i
hope
to
find
in
woman
i
believe
dwells
in
your
clear
soul
lotte
i
feeling
how
rich
you
are
in
sterling
virtues

no
more
for
you

wealthy

what
influence
can
the
intemperate
words
of
my
father
have
hereafter
upon
my
happiness
i
shall
ever
love
you
it
shall
be
my
study
to
retain
your
attachment
and
for
the
rest
it
is
all
empty
pomp
and
pride
which
we
can
be
very
very
happy

not
be
mark
exclaimed
lotte
with
a
deep
sigh
can
not
be
echoed
mark
as
though
he
had
not
heard
aright
it
must
not
be
she
said
plaintively
but
yet
very
firmly
must
part
mark
oh

me
grateful
for
your
kindly
expressed
thoughts
and
for
the
tender
preference
so
dear
so
very
dear
to
my
heart
which
you
have
evinced
for
me
believe
that
to
have
been
your
wife
mark

to
me
have
proved
the
greatest
felicity
i
can
imagine
on
earth
yet
i
can
not
consent
even
to
secure
my
own
happiness
to
sow
dissension
in
the
hearts
of
others
i
could
not
look
at
times
mark
upon
your
brow
clouded
sometimes
by
thoughts
of
home
and
those

there

feeling
how
deeply
i
have
erred
in
causing
strife
to
rise
up
between
you
and
lotte
do
not
drive
me
to
distraction
and
despair
cried
mark
passionately
world
is
wide
we
will
remove
from
the
scene
of
my
pride
and
selfishness
to
some
brighter
land
i
know
many
spots
surrounded
by
the
clear
blue
waters
of
the
vast
pacific
where
we
can
settle
down
unfettered
by
the
paltry
worldly
distinctions
which
agitate
my
breast
and
mindful
only
of
that
love
which
makes
each
to
the
other
a
world
of
eyes
swam
in
tears
may
not
be
mark
she
said
decidedly
and
then
added
with
agonized
earnestness
am
so
grateful
so
deeply
grateful
for
your
affection
i
will
never
never
suffer
that
gratitude
to
abate
nor
will
i
ever
cease
to
love
you
as
now
most
fervently
for
that
i
am
parting
with
you
but
great
as
the
grief
i
feel
at
our
separation
mark
it
is
less
than
the
consciousness
of
what
i
had
done
in
consenting
to
wed
you
in
the
face
of
the
hostility
of
your
father
nearest
and
dearest
to
you
in
blood
and
affection
would
make
me
eternally
suffer
for
well
i
know
that
his
peace
of
mind
yours
and
that
of
the
other
members
of
your
family
would
all
more
or
less
be
injured
by
my
act
no
mark
i
will
bear
my
trial
as
as
well
as
i
can
all
the
lighter
because
i
have
spared
those
who
fondly
love
you
and
you
who
love
them
from
tearing
asunder
those
ties
which
bind
you
so
closely
together
how
her
poor
bosom
heaved
and
her
lips
quivered
as
she
said
this
exclaimed
mark
with
intense
earnestness
my
love
for
you
my
future
happiness
to
weigh
nothing
in
the
considerations
by
which
you
are
influenced
to
this
harsh
step
mark
mostly
to
myself
i
love
you
mark
let
that
be
your
solace
no
other
man
i
swear
shall
ever
receive
the
hand
you
have
kissed
you
after
we
have
parted
you
will
not
forget
me
no
no
i
do
believe
that
but
you
will
meet
with
others
in
a
higher
sphere
beautiful
accomplished
and
engaging
more
than
i
can
ever
hope
to
be
and
you
not
finish
your
sentence
lotte
cried
mark
huskily
do
not
love
me
or
you
would
not
permit
such
a
thought
to
enter
your
brain
he
added
reproachfully
doubt
wounds
my
heart
exclaimed
lotte
with
evident
pain
will
not
reiterate
what
i
have
confessed
to
you
on
that
point
i
will
only
add
that
i
would
have
cheerfully
married
you
and
joined
in
our
mutual
support
by
my
own
labour
if
such
had
been
needful
i
would
have
done
it
with
the
proudest
content
had
circumstances
been
such
that
i
could
have
entered
your
family
as
an
equal
this
can
not
be
i
see
the
disparity
more
strongly
now
perhaps
than
even
he
who
has
forbidden
me
to
approach
his
affinity
but
mark
i
could
not
consent
to
become
your
wife
and
his
daughter
on
other
terms
than
your
continued
friendship
with
him
without
incurring
contumely
myself
it
is
wholly
impossible
to
change
my
opinions
on
this
point
so
mark
dear
mark
let
us
bid
each
other
farewell
i
am
faint
oppressed
ill
i
would
part
with
you
at
once
for
ever
said
mark
with
burning
eyes
as
he
forced
the
words
through
his
teeth
she
bowed
her
head
ever
she
repeated
he
exclaimed
with
intense
excitement
can
not
argue
this
point
with
you
i
can
not
i
will
not
bid
you
farewell
i
dare
not
yet
girl
we
shall
never
never
meet
again
he
almost
shrieked
those
last
words
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
she
would
have
followed
him
but
that
she
sank
gasping
and
fainting
upon
the
floor
chapter
the
elopement
the
lonely
flight
for
now
i
stand
as
one
upon
a
rock
with
a
wilderness
of
sea
who
marks
the
waxing
tide
grow
wave
by
wave

ever
when
some
envious
surge
will
in
his
brinish
bowels
swallow
him
shakspere
grahame
after
the
departure
of
chewkle
suffered
the
worst
tortures
of
a
terrible
suspense
he
had
no
peace
night
nor
day
within
his
house
or
away
from
it
the
second
flight
of
helen
and
the
narration
given
of
it
by
lester
vane
in
terms
calculated
to
excoriate
the
haughty
arrogant
pride
were
deprived
of
their
more
agonizing
features
by
the
greater
evils
that
threatened
him
already
had
nathan
gomer
so
far
kept
his
word
that
he
had
caused
process
to
be
issued
upon
the
sums
last
advanced
and
grahame
had
the
inexpressible
mortification
of
being
served
with
a
series
of
writs
in
his
own
library
and
by
no
other
person
than
charles
clinton
the
firm
with
which
he
was
connected
had
been
instructed
by
nathan
gomer
and
the
delicate
task
a
very
painful
one
as
it
proved
of
serving
process
was
entrusted
to
him
because
grahame
had
not
responded
to
a
request
made
to
him
to
name
a
solicitor
who
would
accept
service
for
him
charley
was
quite
aware
of
the
desperate
position
of
affairs
as
well
as
of
the
internal
misery
raging
in
the
bosom
of
of
the
members
of
the
family
and
the
inflated
elevation
of
the
other
portion
ignorant
through
the
most
blind
fatuity
of
the
fearful
precipice
upon
which
they
were
already
tottering
his
interviews
with
evangeline
had
since
the
second
departure
of
helen
from
home
been
several
for
she
anxiously
desired
not
only
to
learn
the
fate
of
her
sister
but
she
formed
a
wild
notion
of
leaving
home
herself
and
living
with
helen
whatever
might
be
the
circumstances
in
which
she
was
placed
she
was
wholly
ignorant
of
the
outer
world
she
had
been
brought
up
in
strict
home
seclusion
and
from
the
almost
excessive
amiability
of
her
nature
had
been
as
will
have
been
seen
kept
in
the
back
ground
as
a
degenerate
member
of
a
proud
race
her
impulses
had
been
sneered
at
or
sharply
checked
but
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
give
them
a
direction
she
was
unhappy
at
home
and
there
seemed
every
probability
to
her
that
if
she
remained
with
her
family
she
would
continue
to
be
treated
ever
the
same
more
indeed
like
an
unwelcome
dependant
than
a
child
loving
and
loveable
now
helen
especially
in
her
affliction
had
been
affectionate
and
tender
in
her
behaviour
to
her
and
had
thus
raised
within
her
bosom
a
degree
of
attachment
to
her
which
would
pause
at
no
sacrifice
to
secure
her
happiness
she
believed
that
if
she
were
with
helen
she
would
be
able
to
minister
to
her
comforts
solace
her
griefs
and
smoothe
away
by
her
loving
gentleness
many
of
her
cares
at
the
same
time
she
would
be
with
one
who
would
appreciate
her
acts
respond
to
them
with
warmth
and
not
repel
the
tributes
of
a
most
generous
nature
with
the
cold
precepts
of
frigid
pride
so
she
formed
a
design
to
leave
home
too
that
she
might
live
with
helen
happier
she
felt
she
should
be
in
privation
and
poverty
with
her
than
surrounded
by
luxury
and
pomp
at
home
unaccompanied
by
a
soft
look
or
a
kind
word
in
her
deep
anxiety
to
know
where
helen
had
hidden
herself
she
applied
through
the
means
agreed
upon
to
charley
clinton
to
obtain
the
information
well
for
her
it
was
that
his
heart
was
full
of
manly
honour
for
he
took
no
advantage
of
her
formidable
error
in
holding
clandestine
meetings
with
him
well
for
her
that
the
bland
language
addressed
to
her
at
various
times
by
lester
vane
had
not
induced
her
to
open
her
heart
to
him
respecting
her
sister
helen
her
own
position
at
home
and
the
form
her
wishes
had
taken
the
consequences
of
her
unwitting
error
would
have
been
evidenced
in
her
certain
ruin
as
it
was
charley
clinton
fell
in
love
with
her
but
he
kept
the
knowledge
of
the
fact
confided
to
his
own
bosom
firstly
he
would
not
for
the
realization
of
his
uttermost
wishes
have
betrayed
the
confidence
she
reposed
in
him
secondly
she
appeared
so
elevated
above
him
in
position
that
whatever
might
be
his
adoration
of
her
he
saw
it
was
not
for
him
to
plead
a
in
her
aristocratic
ear
he
treated
her
therfore
with
the
very
highest
respect
the
most
thoughtful
consideration
and
the
gentlest
deference
evangeline
appreciated
his
conduct
to
her
fully
it
was
unusual
and
delicious
she
so
wished
to
be
loved
that
she
might
prove
how
much
she
could
love
and
how
pure
and
disinterested
that
love
could
be
she
had
no
clear
idea
of
the
actual
consequences
of
raising
such
an
emotion
in
the
breast
of
charles
clinton
after
the
first
two
or
three
meetings
she
began
to
ponder
on
the
difference
between
his
treatment
of
her
and
that
of
others
the
servants
of
her
household
taking
their
tone
from
the
conduct
of
and
grahame
were
less
respectful
or
attentive
to
her
than
to
any
other
member
of
the
family
in
the
presence
of
all
at
home
she
felt
herself
to
be
an
intruder
some
one
who
was
of
necessity
obliged
to
be
kept
in
the
family
but
most
unwelcome
nevertheless
in
the
society
of
charles
clinton
she
was
a
wholly
different
being
she
was
elevated
in
her
own
estimation
for
she
saw
that
she
was
in
his
she
could
perceive
by
his
words
his
looks
his
manner
how
highly
he
appreciated
the
affection
she
had
displayed
towards
her
sister
helen
and
how
his
zeal
and
his
behaviour
still
tempered
by
the
most
respectful
propriety
towards
her
increased
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
experienced
the
gratification
of
being
held
in
high
estimation
by
any
human
creature
she
was
fascinated
by
it
and
she
desired
heartily
to
retain
that
estimation
the
desire
to
learn
fate
began
to
be
accompanied
by
the
wish
to
learn
it
from
no
other
lips
than
those
of
charles
clinton
the
hope
that
she
should
eventually
be
able
to
discover
her
sister
and
to
reside
with
her
came
to
be
interpenetrated
by
anticipations
that
charles
through
his
sister
might
be
an
occasional
visitor
at
her
new
abode
his
name
out
of
gratefulness
for
his
exertions
took
its
place
in
her
prayers
the
intervals
between
their
meetings
grew
fewer
and
the
term
of
the
duration
of
the
latter
longer
even
those
intervals
were
broken
by
correspondence
though
neither
in
their
interviews
nor
in
their
notes
did
one
word
of
love
arise
evangeline
grew
anxious
and
eager
for
the
time
of
meeting
after
it
had
been
appointed
and
loth
to
part
with
charley
when
the
moment
for
separation
arrived
she
hung
on
his
arm
when
they
were
about
to
part
and
with
a
strange
pleasure
suffered
her
hand
to
linger
in
his
when
the
word
was
spoken
and
as
she
felt
his
fingers
tremble
while
they
held
hers
she
seemed
to
know
intuitively
that
they
did
so
out
of
his
great
respect
for
her
a
crimson
hectic
burned
her
cheek
as
an
unbidden
but
ungratified
prompting
rose
up
in
her
breast
to
kiss
them
for
their
flattering
testimony
of
his
estimation
of
her
such
was
the
position
between
charles
clinton
and
evangeline
when
he
was
called
upon
to
proceed
to
the
mansion
in
the
park
to
execute
his
at
all
times
unpleasant
and
now
from
what
had
passed
between
him
and
the
gentle
girl
most
painful
task
the
whole
establishment
was
brilliantly
lighted
up
a
splendid
and
rout
was
that
evening
to
be
given
by
the
direction
of
grahame
grahame
had
demurred
alleging
that
circumstances
would
render
it
inconvenient
to
him
but
as
he
had
not
revealed
to
his
lady
the
true
reason
for
not
wishing
the
entertainment
to
be
given
the
lady
treated
his
suggestions
with
contempt
and
issued
her
invitations
and
her
instructions
for
the
feast
the
fact
was
that
the
duke
of
allborne
had
been
caught
in
the
web
of
margaret
grahame
she
had
met
him
at
at
balls
at
entertainments
and
frequently
at
the
opera
she
had
paused
at
nothing
to
create
in
him
a
belief
that
he
had
obtained
the
most
entire
control
over
her
affections
she
flattered
his
vanity
by
making
him
imagine
that
she
deemed
him
an
admirable
crichton
and
his
weaker
and
viler
propensities
by
leading
him
to
fancy
that
beneath
her
cold
exterior
there
dwelt
an
ardent
passion
which
would
urge
her
to
withhold
scarcely
any
favour
to
him
whom
she
so
well
affected
the
party
given
this
night
was
solely
on
his
account
a
conference
between
mother
and
daughter
having
led
to
the
belief
on
both
sides
that
an
could
be
brought
about
that
in
short
the
duke
could
be
made
successfully
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
been
fairly
hooked
that
he
was
prepared
to
bestow
the
ring
and
coronet
and
confess
to
captivity
for
life
his
chains
being
those
forged
by
margaret
claverhouse
grahame
charley
clinton
had
at
first
some
difficulty
to
obtain
an
interview
with
grahame
the
guests
had
not
yet
arrived
and
grahame
was
said
to
be
very
busy
in
his
library
the
usual
method
of
palming
had
however
the
desired
effect
after
some
and
and
when
grahame
understood
that
the
gentleman
who
desired
to
see
him
was
from
the
solicitors
of
nathan
gomer
he
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
of
the
object
of
his
visit
and
to
save
any
chance
of
exposure
by
refusing
to
see
him
he
ordered
him
to
be
admitted
when
charley
entered
grahame
received
him
in
his
haughtiest
and
grandest
manner
and
motioned
him
to
a
seat
charley
however
declined
it
and
opened
the
purport
of
his
visit
in
a
manner
which
was
calculated
to
have
its
weight
with
grahame
he
did
not
for
a
moment
assume
that
pecuniary
inability
to
comply
with
the
demand
upon
grahame
by
nathan
gomer
was
the
true
occasion
of
the
issuing
of
process
but
that
some
disputed
point
had
led
to
a
determination
to
proceed
to
a
trial
to
decide
the
question
at
issue
grahame
therefore
received
the
writs
with
more
apparent
complacency
than
he
would
have
done
tendering
as
an
explanation
for
not
writing
in
answer
to
the
renewal
of
the
application
for
a
settlement
of
nathan
claim
that
he
had
been
out
of
town
an
assertion
which
charley
knew
to
be
false
grahame
gave
a
scarcely
perceptible
shiver
when
he
received
the
writs
but
he
made
an
unequivocal
start
when
charley
said
is
said
to
be
in
existence
a
deed
grahame
professing
to
be
a
waiver
in
your
favour
to
claim
to
the
eglinton
estates
and
bearing
his
signature
can
you
throw
any
light
upon
the
subject
may
i
ask
your
reason
for
putting
that
question
said
grahame
loftily
wilton
denies
the
signature
and
has
instructed
us
to
discover
the
deed
if
grahame
felt
the
roots
of
his
hair
vibrate
what
ground
do
you
assume
such
a
deed
to
be
in
existence
he
asked
striving
to
appear
calm
is
registered
replied
clinton
grahame
remained
silent
his
lips
trembled
he
could
not
have
spoken
if
he
would
can
be
no
doubt
that
there
either
is
or
was
such
a
deed
continued
charley
that
under
the
most
positive
and
vehement
denials
of
wilton
the
signature
it
bears
is
a
forgery
it
is
assumed
therefore
sir
directly
by
wilton
and
indirectly
by
nathan
gomer
that
the
instrument
being
exclusively
in
your
interest
could
scarcely
have
had
the
false
signature
attached
without
your
grahame
felt
as
though
a
poisoned
barb
had
pierced
his
soul
it
was
not
alone
that
the
surmise
was
just
that
he
winced
under
the
accusation
but
his
pride
was
acutely
wounded
at
the
readiness
with
which
he
was
connected
with
an
act
so
base
with
blanched
cheeks
but
a
cold
and
haughty
manner
he
said
with
knitted
brows
the
deed
of
which
you
have
spoken
if
such
there
is
be
produced
it
will
be
time
to
discuss
the
truth
or
falsity
of
so
foul
an
wilton
was
sued
by
you
sir
for
a
large
sum
returned
charley
gravely
very
instrument
of
which
i
speak
was
tendered
to
him
to
sign
he
did
not
sign
it
and
yet
that
deed
has
been
registered
as
being
completed
i
believe
though
i
can
not
speak
with
exact
certainty
that
nathan
gomer
derived
his
information
on
this
head
from
a
scoundrel
name
d
hair
slowly
lifted
up
he
breathed
faintly
replied
charley
observing
the
ghastly
paleness
which
had
spread
itself
over
visage
mercenary
wretch
who
would
pause
at
no
employment
however
villanous
in
proof
of
which
i
may
tell
you
although
i
may
be
stepping
out
of
my
path
of
strict
duty
in
doing
so
that
a
telegraphic
message
had
just
reached
our
office
with
the
terrible
news
that
the
ruffian
chewkle
of
whom
i
have
just
spoken
encountering
early
this
morning
wilton
in
the
woods
at
harley
dale
discharged
a
pistol
at
him
and
severely
wounded
him
he
was
seized
in
the
attempt
to
consummate
the
murderous
act
and
is
at
the
present
moment
in
safe
custody
it
is
expected
he
will
make
some
important
a
rush
of
ringing
sounds
surged
through
brain
his
eyes
dilated
and
glared
at
charley
with
a
frightful
expression
the
veins
upon
his
temples
swelled
as
though
they
would
burst
and
his
throat
expanded
and
contracted
with
a
horrible
spasmodic
action
charley
took
a
step
towards
him
alarmed
by
his
agitation
but
grahame
waved
him
imperiously
off
he
wiped
the
large
drops
of
clammy
perspiration
thickly
clustered
from
his
brow
and
in
a
hoarse
voice
said
hastily
wilton
wilton
is
he
dead
returned
charley
trembling
under
a
terrible
suspicion
he
yet
lives
communication
stated
his
wound
to
be
severe
but
not
fatal
however
his
son
has
just
quitted
london
to
proceed
to
his
bedside
accompanied
by
an
eminent
surgeon
son
what
son
gasped
grahame
in
a
hollow
tone
eldest
child
and
only
son
he
has
not
long
since
returned
to
england
from
south
america
returned
charley
fortunately
met
with
him
on
my
way
hither
and
informed
him
of
what
had
taken
place
he
at
once
proceeded
to
obtain
a
surgeon
of
great
skill
and
upon
securing
his
services
he
intended
that
together
they
should
immediately
hasten
to
grahame
sank
into
a
chair
it
was
plain
he
was
in
the
throes
of
a
violent
spasm
charley
was
pained
to
see
his
agonized
prostration
he
had
already
gone
farther
than
in
his
capacity
he
ought
strictly
to
have
done
he
knew
that
for
the
advantage
of
his
firm
he
ought
not
to
have
revealed
what
he
had
disclosed
but
it
had
been
for
sake
he
had
been
thus
communicative
and
he
was
at
the
same
time
convinced
that
the
actual
interests
of
wilton
and
gomer
had
not
been
compromised
by
his
act
in
truth
he
could
not
refrain
from
preparing
grahame
in
some
degree
for
the
bursting
of
the
dense
and
threatening
cloud
hanging
over
his
head
he
gazed
with
saddened
commiseration
upon
the
stupified
man
who
sat
before
him
with
clasped
hands
gazing
wildly
into
vacancy
and
then
in
a
soft
kindly
tone
he
said
will
no
longer
obtrude
my
presence
sir
upon
you
i
feel
that
it
is
as
unwelcome
as
the
tidings
i
have
communicated
yet
before
i
depart
permit
me
to
suggest
that
your
opposition
to
the
claim
of
nathan
gomer
can
be
but
of
brief
duration
while
the
expense
of
going
to
trial
will
be
enormous
securities
are
so
indisputable
that
a
jury
would
be
certain
to
give
a
verdict
in
his
favour
and
the
court
would
unhesitatingly
grant
instant
execution
pardon
me
if
i
appear
officious
or
impertinent
by
my
suggestions
i
have
no
such
intent
i
am
only
sincerely
desirous
of
acquainting
you
with
the
aspect
affairs
are
assuming
and
i
would
so
prepare
you
that
you
may
know
how
to
properly
confront
in
voice
there
was
a
tone
of
genuine
sympathy
which
there
was
no
mistaking
or
misunderstanding
and
the
heart
of
the
criminal
must
have
been
callous
indeed
could
it
have
resisted
its
softening
influences
grahame
was
too
unused
to
it
to
remain
unaffected
by
it
at
one
time
he
would
have
spurned
its
display
now
it
fell
like
balm
upon
his
burning
thoughts
he
rose
up
suddenly
and
wrung
hand
and
then
with
an
almost
frantic
gesture
he
waved
to
him
to
leave
charley
bowed
and
quitted
the
library
with
a
heavy
weight
about
his
heart
as
he
closed
the
door
and
prepared
to
pass
along
the
corridor
he
paused
for
an
instant
this
it
is
he
muttered
live
in
splendour
in
pomp
and
proud
luxury
how
magnificent
how
superb
to
gaze
at
what
foul
festering
corrosion
beneath
how
i
have
longed
to
achieve
such
a
position
as
this
but
oh
how
i
should
shrink
from
it
if
it
were
to
be
only
obtained
on
the
conditions
which
are
throttling
the
proud
head
of
this
house
and
hurling
him
into
earthly
if
not
eternal
while
the
last
words
were
on
his
lips
he
heard
the
rustling
of
silk
in
his
vicinity
he
stood
aside
to
allow
the
coming
female
to
pass
and
almost
the
next
instant
he
saw
the
fair
sweet
face
of
evangeline
looking
up
to
his
own
she
stopped
in
evident
surprise
here
clinton
she
said
in
a
low
tone
of
astonishment
then
she
added
hastily
you
heard
anything
of
my
sister
helen
have
you
come
to
bring
me
tidings
of
her
she
was
full
dressed
her
attire
mainly
composed
of
faint
blue
silver
and
lace
was
eminently
suited
to
her
fair
complexion
upon
her
head
she
wore
a
wreath
of
white
flowers
and
in
eyes
she
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
exquisitely
lovely
fairy
spirits
of
whom
with
such
passionate
interest
he
had
read
in
german
legends
he
sighed
as
he
thought
how
hopelessly
she
was
out
of
the
pale
of
his
companionship
but
he
concealed
the
emotion
the
thought
occasioned
he
merely
raised
his
finger
warningly
and
said
in
a
very
low
voice
am
most
loth
to
affright
or
afflict
you
dear
miss
grahame
but
there
is
a
storm
hovering
over
your
house
and
unless
i
am
greatly
deceived
it
will
burst
with
a
terrible
crash
almost
immediately
i
can
not
dare
not
explain
myself
but
i
would
have
you
prepared
when
the
bolt
does
fall
i
would
have
you
call
up
your
energies
and
sustain
yourself
under
the
trial
at
least
i
would
not
have
it
descend
upon
you
without
preparation
or
warning
i
can
not
avert
it
but
i
may
be
able
to
be
of
service
in
the
hour
of
your
affliction
you
know
how
to
summon
me
fear
not
but
i
will
appear
at
your
he
cast
one
passionate
glance
upon
her
beautiful
countenance
overspread
with
a
terrified
amazement
and
hurried
away
for
once
more
the
rustling
of
silks
announced
the
approach
of
females
and
evangeline
almost
ran
into
the
to
avoid
the
scrutiny
of
her
mother
and
sister
the
dinner
party
was
large
and
brilliant
grahame
dressed
as
it
seemed
with
studied
care
presided
the
company
were
unusually
animated
the
honorable
lester
vane
was
present
though
uninvited
by
grahame
or
her
husband
but
the
duke
of
allborne
had
been
honoured
with
a
for
friends
who
might
add
to
the
distinguished
character
of
the
assembly
and
with
a
particular
motive
he
had
used
his
privilege
to
bring
vane
with
him
the
latter
accepted
his
offer
for
he
had
his
motives
too
and
despite
the
omission
of
his
name
from
the
list
of
the
formally
invited
he
made
his
appearance
looking
grahame
defiantly
in
the
eyes
when
she
received
him
with
stiff
politeness
he
deprecated
in
studied
words
every
one
of
which
stung
her
to
the
quick
any
apology
for
the
oversight
as
he
expressed
himself
certain
the
unfortunate
circumstances
attendant
upon
the
absence
of
her
eldest
daughter
had
naturally
disturbed
her
usually
calm
and
retentive
memory
he
looked
sallow
and
savage
his
large
dark
eyes
glittered
like
a
upon
the
spring
there
was
a
dull
red
mark
upon
his
forehead
where
hugh
rivers
blow
had
fallen
when
he
felled
him
to
the
earth
and
he
apparently
took
no
pains
to
conceal
it
he
seemed
to
wear
it
as
a
badge
of
distinction
that
might
attract
all
eyes
and
many
questions
enabling
him
thus
to
answer
them
in
terms
which
would
tear
all
panoply
of
pride
into
shreds
and
trample
them
scornfully
under
foot
how
troubled
she
felt
on
seeing
him
how
disqustedly
she
listened
to
his
words
with
what
sickening
apprehension
she
gazed
upon
the
cicatrised
wound
upon
his
forehead
she
felt
as
he
passed
into
the
room
beyond
that
her
expectations
of
a
proud
triumph
were
likely
to
be
turned
into
torturing
anticipations
of
shame
and
degradation
her
pride
now
changed
her
from
a
juno
to
an
ate
there
was
no
telling
into
what
extravagances
during
this
presence
it
might
hurry
her
as
lester
vane
sauntered
on
he
caught
sight
of
evangeline
who
looked
pale
and
abstracted
he
advanced
towards
her
and
spoke
to
her
with
low
musical
tones
he
bent
his
eyes
upon
her
with
the
fascination
of
a
gaze
but
she
shrank
from
him
in
undisguised
aversion
horrified
aversion
there
could
certainly
be
no
mistaking
the
expression
so
decided
was
it
in
character
that
he
in
the
fullness
of
his
immeasurable
conceit
actually
looked
over
his
shoulder
expecting
there
to
see
some
object
as
the
real
cause
of
her
disgust
but
there
was
no
one
but
himself
to
fasten
upon
and
he
grated
his
teeth
at
the
conviction
miss
evangeline
he
lisped

our
with
a
gratification
i
am
unable
to

tendered
his
hand
but
she
recoiled
from
it
and
him
as
though
he
were
indeed
a
noxious
reptile
helen
had
spoken
of
him
to
her
in
hot
and
blistering
words
she
now
feared
and
loathed
him
she
moved
hastily
to
the
side
of
her
mother
and
lester
vane
muttering
an
oath
sallied
into
the
the
dinner
was
announced
was
eaten
and
at
a
somewhat
late
hour
dancing
commenced
lester
vane
sought
evangeline
for
a
partner
she
distinctly
declined
to
dance
with
him
and
he
turned
away
infuriated
not
that
she
danced
at
all
her
brain
was
in
a
whirl
of
confusion
she
was
alarmed
by
the
agitation
displayed
by
her
mother
who
flushed
and
excited
as
she
had
never
seen
her
before
followed
lester
vane
like
a
shadow
and
whenever
he
commenced
conversation
with
a
group
of
guests
interposed
and
broke
it
up
to
follow
him
still
she
was
much
startled
and
nervously
frightened
too
by
her
aspect
he
seemed
to
walk
like
a
somnambulist
through
the
saloons
he
appeared
to
be
wandering
as
in
search
of
some
one
and
eventually
he
disappeared
the
admirable
quadrille
band
played
its
most
enlivening
airs
and
the
dancing
went
on
with
spirit
evangeline
looked
among
the
dancers
for
her
sister
margaret
for
in
spite
of
her
repellant
coldness
she
thought
that
she
would
lend
an
ear
to
her
forebodings
respecting
both
parents
indeed
she
was
growing
distracted
for
what
with
charles
vague
warning
her
ghastly
aberration
and
her
flushed
excitement
she
felt
each
coming
instant
would
produce
some
event
of
a
frightful
kind
but
margaret
was
not
to
be
seen
evangeline
searched
the
saloons
in
vain
no
she
was
in
the
garden
with
a
thick
shawl
muffled
round
her
listening
to
the
pleadings
of
the
duke
of
allborne
what
had
they
been
saying
to
each

jeuce

in

the

enrapturedly

he
folded
her
shawl
tightly
round
her
trembling
frame
and
placing
his
arms
close
about
her
waist
he
drew
her
to
the
same
spot
from
whence
hugh
riversdale
had
conveyed
her
sister
helen
away
they
stood
upon
the
brink
of
the
winding
stream
so
charming
in
its
ornamental
character
so
facile
for
mischief
at
a
signal
from
the
duke
a
boat
swiftly
appeared
a
was
handed
up
by
the
man
in
charge
of
the
boat
and
margaret
was
closely
muffled
in
it
she
was
then
lifted
into
the
small
vessel
and
the
duke
stepped
lightly
in
after
her
one
moment
more
and
the
boat
glided
silently
but
swiftly
away
the
lights
streamed
brilliantly
from
the
windows
of
the
villa
mansion
strains
of
joyous
music
issued
from
the
crowded
saloons
and
in
noisy
hilarity
the
dancers
whirled
with
rapid
steps
round
the
gorgeously
decorated
apartments
all
within
their
scope
seemed
to
be
instinct
with
joy
and
happiness
when
the
boat
disappeared
there
came
from
the
shadow
of
the
trees
in
the
garden
the
figure
of
a
man
it
was
grahame
he
had
wandered
as
in
a
dream
from
the
heated
rooms
thronged
with
gay
visitors
not
one
of
whom
he
cared
for
or
who
cared
for
him
and
while
leaning
thoughtfully
brooding
over
his
desperate
position
against
a
tree
he
had
witnessed
the
meeting
of
the
duke
and
his
daughter
margaret
he
cared
not
to
interrupt
them
but
glided
back
into
his
house
like
a
thief
no
one
observed
him
enter
he
slunk
to
his
his
valet
was
not
there
he
hastily
divested
himself
of
his
habiliments
and
put
on
some
plain
clothing
when
thus
attired
he
crept
down
the
staircase
darted
through
the
basement
passage
and
passed
unobserved
by
the
entrance
into
the
front
of
his
mansion
and
made
his
way
through
the
throng
of
carriages
assembled
there
he
went
on
through
the
park
up
towards
hampstead
passed
over
its
dreary
heath
the
earth
and
shrubs
looking
black
beneath
the
gloomy
sky
he
paused
when
he
reached
the
and
turned
his
bloodshot
eyes
towards
the
spot
he
had
left
thus
abruptly
and
secretly
he
shuddered
and
struck
down
the
hill
towards
hendon
passing
with
shivering
frame
and
tottering
steps
along
the
narrow
pathway
between
the
prickly
scrubby

muttered
to
inhale
chloroform
as
it
would
inevitably
prove
fatal
to
me
it
is
well
my
chemist
included
it
in
the
articles
in
my
medicine
chest

will
afford
me
an
easy
release
from
life
and
its
horrors
and
if
i
manage
well
leave
no
clue
to
the
manner
of
my
at
a
lone
spot
by
the
side
of
a
pool
he
sat
him
down
and
bowing
his
head
upon
his
knees
pressed
his
hands
upon
his
scorching
forehead
and
wept
scalding
bitter
bitter
tears

the
abduction

its
punishment

will
i
bear
to
a
lovely
spot
where
our
hands
shall
be
joined
and
our
sorrows
forgot
there
thou
yet
shall
be
my
bride
byron
it
is
unhappily
the
nature
of
jealousy
to
magnify
small
things
into
great
ones
and
to
build
upon
the
flimsiest
supposition
a
series
of
incidents
inflaming
to
the
brain
of
the
jaundiced
thinker
but
which
nevertheless
have
no
foundation
in
fact
unfortunately
the
jealous
too
often
act
upon
these
probabilities
as
if
they
had
really
happened
and
in
the
paroxysms
of
rage
and
agony
created
by
unworthy
visions
reason
takes
to
flight
and
the
worst
extravagances
are
the
result
this
was
the
case
with
colonel
mires
he
had
assumed
interviews
between
flora
and
young
vivian
which
had
never
taken
place
his
prurient
mind
not
improved
by
his
residence
in
india
had
wrought
out
love
passages
which
had
not
occurred
and
he
groaned
gnashed
his
teeth
and
even
wept
with
agony
that
he
passionately
loved
flora
even
unto
frenzy
was
beyond
a
doubt
and
that
it
worked
him
up
to
a
pitch
of
insanity
is
equally
true
as
his
recent
conduct
proved
in
india
in
command
of
a
native
regiment
his
power
was
great
he
was
in
a
small
sphere
a
monarch
in
england
he
felt
curbed
trammelled
shackled
and
if
he
had
not
had
an
indian
servant
in
close
attendance
to
expend
that
love
and
inordinate
desire
for
supreme
command
upon
he
would
have
been
constantly
committing
some
outrageous
outbreak
of
temper
which
of
necessity
would
have
often
precipitated
him
into
trouble
he
chafed
at
the
restraint
the
state
of
society
in
england
placed
upon
him
and
when
it
was
impossible
to
conceal
from
himself
that
he
was
the
veriest
slave
to
beauty
he
was
infuriate
to
find
that
his
wish
no
less
than
his
will
went
for
nothing
in
effecting
a
result
in
which
the
happiness
or
misery
of
his
whole
future
life
was
involved
the
confession
of
love
for
vivian
which
flora
had
made
to
her
father
and
the
expressed
determination
of
old
wilton
to
give
her
hand
to
the
honorable
lester
vane
scattered
any
floating
delusive
hopes
he
might
have
entertained
he
saw
that
she
could
only
become
his
by
some
bold
act
of
villany
perpetrated
regardless
of
all
consequences
attendant
upon
its
frustration
he
formed
a
plan
with
subtlety
and
made
his
arrangements
with
skill
he
went
over
the
whole
distance
between
harleydale
and
southampton
carefully
making
a
chart
of
the
he
provided
relays
of
horses
at
unfrequented
spots
and
at
every
house
where
it
would
be
necessary
to
rest
for
the
night
or
stay
for
refreshment
he
palmed
off
on
the
host
a
story
that
his
task
was
the
distressing
one
of
conveying
a
young
lady
afflicted
with
raving
insanity
to
an
asylum
for
lunatics
every
minute
detail
of
the
plan
was
carefully
considered
before
adoption
and
every
possible
contingency
foreseen
and
provided
against
there
was
one
exception
it
did
not
strike
colonel
mires
that
he
was
distrusted
suspected
of
evil
machinations
and
was
therefore
closely
watched
such
a
probability
was
omitted
from
his
calculations
how
in
fact
was
he
to
conjecture
that
nathan
gomer
having
perused
his
physiognomy
carefully
while
vivian
was
replying
to
the
charges
he
had
made
against
him
had
formed
a
conclusion
most
unfavourable
to
him
that
in
short
the
shrewd
little
man
had
believed
he
read
in
the
workings
of
his
features
a
strong
determination
to
commit
an
evil
deed
by
which
vivian
directly
and
flora
indirectly
would
be
made
to
suffer
yet
such
was
the
fact
and
nathan
gomer
was
not
the
man
to
pause
in
doubt
when
he
suspected
evil
having
several
agents
in
his
pay
he
instructed
one
upon
whom
he
could
rely
and
from
that
moment
colonel
mires
went
nowhere
abroad
without
an
unknown
attendant
of
whose
existence
he
was
unconscious
but
who
dogged
his
footsteps
with
untiring
pertinacity
the
scheme
of
the
abduction
was
therefore
by
the
revelations
of
his
agent
gradually
unfolded
to
nathan
gomer
who
let
the
arrangements
of
the
colonel
proceed
until
the
culminating
point
was
at
hand
when
he
communicated
with
young
vivian
and
placed
in
his
hands
the
power
as
he
calculated
of
appearing
upon
the
scene
at
a
moment
of
vital
importance
to
flora
and
of
appearing
once
more
before
old
wilton
as
the
saviour
of
his
honour
as
he
had
been
of
her
life
hal
vivian
was
visited
by
nathan
gomer
as
he
was
making
preparation
to
leave
england
to
fulfil
a
short
engagement
offered
him
on
high
terms
in
the
united
states
the
acceptance
of
which
had
been
pressed
upon
him
by
the
first
manufacturing
goldsmith
in
england
the
communication
he
received
altered
his
plan
although
it
happened
that
he
reached
harleydale
too
late
to
prevent
flora
being
carried
off
but
yet
in
time
to
save
the
life
of
wilton
thus
it
fell
out
upon
reaching
the
village
of
harleydale
he
had
an
interview
with
agent
who
told
him
that
a
close
carriage
belonging
to
colonel
mires
was
in
a
contiguous
to
harleydale
park
and
the
colonel
himself
was
somewhere
up
in
the
woods
lying
in
wait
it
was
supposed
for
flora
in
order
to
carry
his
project
into
execution
it
was
arranged
that
the
agent
should
watch
the
carriage
and
hal
should
go
up
into
the
woods
and
hunt
up
the
colonel
the
result
of
this
arrangement
has
been
seen
he
saved
old
wilton
from
the
murderous
weapon
of
chewkle
and
the
colonel
got
safely
off
with
flora
for
the
agent
had
to
rush
back
to
the
village
when
he
saw
flora
conveyed
senseless
to
the
carriage
to
mount
a
horse
already
provided
to
follow
the
vehicle
that
he
might
at
the
first
place
where
assistance
was
to
be
obtained
stop
the
further
progress
of
the
outrage
upon
miss
liberty
he
left
a
note
for
vivian
who
obtained
from
it
information
of
the
direction
he
was
to
pursue
and
though
not
much
used
to
riding
his
horsemanship
under
the
impulse
which
was
almost
maddening
would
have
done
honour
to
a
rider
colonel
mires
had
had
the
shrewdness
to
provide
a
pair
of
strong
fleet
horses
for
the
start
he
instructed
his
coachman
to
do
the
first
stage
of
ten
miles
at
a
hand
gallop
the
man
obeyed
even
though
the
roads
were
heavy
the
ruts
deep
and
the
carriage
several
times
was
within
an
ace
of
being
overturned
the
second
stage
with
fresh
horses
was
performed
in
a
similar
manner
though
at
a
less
rate
of
speed
because
the
horses
were
not
so
good
and
being
pushed
all
but
knocked
up
at
their
eighth
mile
the
third
stage
was
commenced
with
another
relay
of
horses
and
proceeded
much
at
the
same
rate
on
a
journey
unchecked
and
with
undiminished
speed
no
delay
except
changing
horses
had
taken
place
from
the
moment
of
departure
as
yet
but
the
colonel
believing
that
when
he
had
placed
miles
between
him
and
harleydale
accomplishing
the
distance
in
four
hours
he
might
with
safety
pause
for
a
short
time
in
order
to
give
his
coachman
rest
and
himself
obtain
some
refreshment
he
determined
to
do
so
and
gave
his
indian
servant
orders
to
that
effect
no
pursuer
as
yet
had
appeared
in
sight
nor
any
sign
that
even
if
flora
had
been
missed
a
clue
elucidating
the
mystery
surrounding
her
abrupt
disappearance
had
been
obtained
indeed
he
expected
none
in
the
first
place
there
had
not
been
time
in
the
second
he
had
so
full
a
conviction
of
the
successful
secrecy
of
his
operations
that
he
calculated
upon
being
the
very
last
person
who
would
be
charged
with
having
anything
to
do
with
abduction
flora
had
been
soon
after
the
carriage
was
set
in
motion
restored
by
the
attentions
of
the
ayah
to
consciousness
and
on
opening
her
eyes
gazed
wildly
round
her
it
was
some
little
time
before
she
could
realise
her
position
at
length
the
face
of
colonel
mires
and
the
motion
of
the
vehicle
in
which
she
was
seated
supported
in
the
arms
of
the
indian
woman
gave
her
some
notion
of
her
true
situation
and
rousing
herself
she
made
an
effort
to
recall
the
past
and
then
said
to
colonel
mires
is
the
meaning
sir
of
this
outrage
how
is
it
that
i
find
myself
alone
with
you
and
this
indian
servant
torn
from
my
home
and
borne
with
frightful
rapidity
in
an
unknown
direction
colonel
mires
turned
his
inflamed
eyes
upon
her
and
in
a
tone
of
passionate
tenderness
replied
your
more
than
mortal
beauty
and
your
in
difference
to
my
almost
more
than
mortal
love
for
you
oh
flora
i
can
not
see
you
can
not
know
you
to
be
my
adoration
for
you
is
without
limit
and
if
i
have
resorted
to
a
bold
step
it
is
only
because
my
passion
for
you
would
pause
at
nothing
to
ensure
my
have
resorted
to
a
mean
and
wicked
artifice
to
place
me
in
your
power
colonel
mires
she
exclaimed
awaiting
his
answer
with
an
intensity
of
eagerness
which
it
was
somewhat
remarkable
he
did
not
notice
stratagems
it
is
said
are
fair
in
he
replied
i
adopted
one
which
has
occasioned
you
pain
i
regret
its
action
though
i
rejoice
at
its
result
for
it
gave
me
you
understand
me
sweet
flora
you
must
be
mine
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
escape
that
issue
but
i
shall
treat
you
with
the
greatest
possible
respect
until
we
are
united
your
dignity
shall
not
be
insulted
nor
your
modesty
offended
by
act
by
word
or
look
every
desire
or
wish
you
may
form
save
that
of
severing
yourself
from
me
shall
be
gratified
i
will
be
your
slave
ministering
to
your
will
in
all
things
except
in
aught
that
would
take
you
from
me
you
will
find
me
scrupulously
adhere
to
this
promise
in
every
respect
at
the
same
time
let
me
inform
you
that
any
attempt
to
release
yourself
will
be
futile
my
arrangements
have
been
so
made
that
all
entreaties
and
appeals
for
assistance
will
be
in
vain
we
are
now
on
our
way
to
southampton
from
thence
by
packet
direct
to
madeira
only
at
appointed
places
shall
we
stay
and
at
each
place
the
persons
there
are
prepared
to
see
with
me
a
young
lady
of
surpassing
beauty
but
a
confirmed
lunatic
insane
upon
the
fancy
that
she
is
being
forcibly
abducted
from
home
i
deem
it
advisable
to
make
you
thus
much
acquainted
with
my
plan
to
spare
you
the
agony
of
useless
displays
at
funchal
i
hope
to
induce
you
to
become
my
wife
at
least
i
will
ensure
that
you
shall
never
be
the
bride
of
he
ceased
flora
made
no
reply
the
note
which
informed
her
of
the
sudden
death
of
vivian
professing
to
be
written
by
harper
was
a
forgery
acknowledged
to
be
such
by
the
colonel
she
cared
little
for
the
rest
she
had
faith
in
being
rescued
or
in
effecting
an
escape
from
the
clutches
of
the
scoundrel
who
had
made
her
prisoner
and
was
bearing
her
away
she
could
not
conceive
how
one
or
the
other
could
be
accomplished
but
she
had
no
doubt
that
she
would
be
set
free
before
she
was
forced
on
board
the
ship
of
which
he
had
spoken
hal
was
not
dead
she
could
bear
all
the
rest
with
comparative
equanimity
as
we
have
said
she
did
not
reply
to
mires
nor
afterwards
speak
a
word
in
answer
to
any
remark
he
made
or
question
he
put
to
her
she
declined
all
refreshment
though
he
pressed
her
earnestly
at
the
end
of
the
third
stage
to
partake
of
it
and
resisted
every
inducement
to
utter
a
word
they
were
well
away
on
the
fourth
stage
still
pursuing
unfrequented
when
the
indian
coachman
suddenly
put
his
head
down
to
the
window
and
called
his
tone
was
so
urgent
and
startling
that
colonel
mires
leaped
from
the
recumbent
position
in
which
he
placed
himself
for
the
last
hour
watching
with
an
unswerving
ardent
gaze
the
beautiful
but
saddened
face
of
flora
he
bent
his
head
towards
his
man
and
with
a
brusque
tone
demanded
what
had
occurred
are
pursued
sahib
replied
the
indian
very
decisively
echoed
the
colonel
rapidly
whom
the
indian
pointed
with
his
whip
they
were
passing
over
a
hilly
tract
of
land
at
a
distance
of
some
four
or
five
miles
the
road
wound
along
a
ridge
which
skirted
a
steep
hill
pursuing
that
road
at
a
brisk
pace
were
a
couple
of
horsemen
mires
gazed
at
them
intently
they
appeared
to
him
to
be
taking
a
course
leading
in
an
opposite
direction
to
that
in
which
his
carriage
was
proceeding
he
said
as
much
the
indian
gave
a
significant
shake
of
the
head
came
same
road
as
dat
sahib
they
are
on
our
track
seen
dis
coming
same
road
as
us
tellee
true
the
colonel
was
however
disposed
to
scout
the
notion
that
the
horsemen
were
in
pursuit
of
him
how
was
it
possible
he
mentally
inquired
that
any
clue
as
yet
could
have
been
obtained
to
the
cause
of
disappearance
and
the
route
he
had
taken
in
bearing
her
off
suddenly
he
forced
an
oath
through
his
teeth
and
he
broke
out
in
a
clammy
perspiration
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
villain
chewkle
might
have
betrayed
him
no
dependence
could
be
placed
on
mercenaries
experience
had
taught
him
that
fact
but
under
any
circumstances
he
thought
it
unadvisable
to
give
away
even
the
shadow
of
a
chance
against
him
he
therefore
called
sharply
to
his
indian
servant
push
the
horses
into
a
smart
gallop
we
can
not
have
far
to
travel
ere
we
reach
the
stage
where
we
have
arranged
to
rest
for
a
few
hours
we
shall
soon
ascertain
the
purpose
of
those
fellows
if
they
are
really
in
pursuit
we
will
prepare
for
the
worst
and
stick
at
nothing
should
the
consequences
prove
fatal
to
those
who
attempt
to
intercept
us
the
fault
will
be
theirs
i
have
devoted
myself
to
the
accomplishment
of
my
object
and
bloodshed
will
not
stay
me
in
effecting
it
lash
the
horses
lash
them
make
them
fly
over
the
remaining
distance
give
the
brutes
the
thong
away
the
indian
obeyed
and
the
horses
under
the
application
of
the
whip
administered
with
an
unsparing
and
unpitying
hand
plunged
madly
forward
snorting
and
chafing
under
the
smarting
cuts
savagely
dealt
upon
them
their
route
now
from
a
level
road
lay
suddenly
down
a
hill
with
severe
curves
in
it
colonel
mires
rose
up
in
his
seat
and
looked
eagerly
after
the
horsemen
and
his
brow
clouded
as
he
perceived
them
abruptly
leave
the
main
road
and
leaping
their
horses
over
a
which
lined
it
strike
across
country
directly
towards
him
he
sat
down
muttering
an
oath
and
with
indescribable
horror
flora
perceived
him
draw
from
beneath
one
of
the
seats
a
case
which
on
his
opening
it
disclosed
a
couple
of
revolvers
each
with
a
long
polished
single
barrel
she
saw
him
examine
them
carefully
to
insure
their
being
ready
for
instant
use
and
she
observed
with
apprehension
and
disgust
that
his
contracted
brows
and
clenched
teeth
indicated
a
most
deadly
determination
she
felt
sick
faint
and
dizzy
with
fear
her
terror
being
proportionably
increased
by
the
frightful
speed
at
which
she
could
see
by
the
passing
objects
and
tell
by
the
awful
rocking
jumping
motion
of
the
carriage
they
were
being
borne
along
the
colonel
scarcely
noticed
the
tremendous
pace
into
which
his
servant
had
lashed
the
horses
he
was
in
deep
conjecture
respecting
his
pursuers
he
thought
it
not
improbable
mark
wilton
might
be
one
he
hated
him
for
he
had
been
treated
by
him
with
distrust
and
scarcely
concealed
dislike
he
felt
that
it
would
cost
him
but
little
repugnance
to
shoot
him
but
then
he
was
brother
and
his
blood
upon
his
hands
was
not
calculated
to
prosper
his
wooing
nevertheless
rather
than
resign
flora
he
was
resolved
not
to
stop
short
even
at
that
crime
he
was
roused
from
his
reverie
by
the
horrified
moans
of
the
ayah
and
the
sudden
outcries
of
his
indian
attendant
he
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
saw
that
the
steeds
had
been
lashed
into
frenzy
and
in
their
progress
down
the
hill
their
own
impetus
added
to
the
enormously
accelerated
velocity
of
the
vehicle
unchecked
by
a
drag
had
urged
them
to
a
speed
which
was
beyond
their
own
control
giving
way
to
fright
they
dashed
blindly
on
unheeding
in
their
fearful
wildness
the
check
which
the
indian
attempted
to
impose
on
them
the
instant
he
found
they
were
beyond
command
but
he
discovered
his
mastery
was
gone
and
he
soon
lost
all
presence
of
mind
and
shrieked
to
his
master
that
the
horses
were
flying
with
them
to
destruction
the
ayah
quickly
added
her
shrieks
to
the
yells
of
the
completely
scared
indian
and
mires
with
no
little
consternation
saw
the
danger
in
which
all
were
placed
but
he
was
powerless
to
aid
to
open
the
door
and
jump
out
would
have
been
to
court
death
to
remain
where
he
was
would
be
to
incur
injuries
it
was
impossible
to
calculate
upon
he
pulled
down
the
window
behind
the
coachman
and
commenced
an
attempt
to
crawl
through
the
opening
to
gain
if
possible
a
seat
on
the
box
in
the
hope
that
uniting
his
strength
with
that
of
the
indian
who
still
clung
to
the
reins
the
horses
might
be
pulled
up
he
had
just
advanced
his
head
and
shoulders
through
the
window
when
the
carriage
was
dashed
with
tremendous
force
against
a
tall
hedge
and
the
indian
was
swept
like
lightning
from
the
box
the
ayah
shrieked
frantically
and
flora
at
the
shock
fainted
away
the
horses
plunged
and
kicked
in
the
madness
of
terror
and
tore
the
carriage
wheels
through
the
impediments
opposed
to
their
progress
they
bounded
forward
in
their
impetuous
career
and
swept
down
the
hill
with
more
tremendous
rapidity
than
ever
within
a
hundred
yards
the
road
took
a
sharp
abrupt
turn
facing
the
horses
stood
the
stone
ruins
of
an
ancient
building
under
no
control
completely
blind
in
their
frantic
terror
they
kept
on
their
distracted
way
swerving
only
by
their
own
infuriate
motions
but
turning
not
as
the
sharp
wind
of
the
road
came
upon
them
with
a
terrific
crash
they
dashed
into
the
ruins
killing
themselves
and
shattering
the
carriage
to
atoms
in
one
fearful
and
fatal
collision
in
the
meantime
the
two
horsemen
who
as
it
may
be
surmised
were
hal
vivian
and
nathan
agent
whom
he
had
overtaken
were
fast
approaching
the
scene
of
the
disastrous
accident
the
fugitives
would
have
been
overtaken
before
they
had
reached
so
far
but
for
the
delay
in
getting
fresh
steeds
as
it
was
hal
was
almost
knocked
up
with
fatigue
save
that
the
intensity
of
his
anxiety
for
safety
prevented
his
feeling
the
physical
exhaustion
he
would
otherwise
have
done
he
would
have
kept
on
until
he
had
dropped
rather
than
risk
the
possibility
of
losing
her
by
even
a
necessary
delay
for
rest
and
refreshment
having
from
the
ridge
spoken
of
when
the
attention
of
colonel
mires
was
first
drawn
to
his
pursuers
perceived
the
flying
vehicle
at
bold
suggestion
he
and
his
companion
leaped
the
hedge
skirting
the
road
and
made
their
way
by
the
direct
line
instead
of
pursuing
the
circuitous
path
the
difficulties
they
had
encountered
were
many
but
nearly
half
the
distance
was
saved
and
they
at
length
after
leaping
gullies
and
hedges
wading
streams
and
forcing
a
way
through
part
of
a
plantation
one
tangle
of
undergrowth
emerged
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
down
which
the
carriage
containing
flora
had
been
whirled
to
annihilation
at
this
spot
there
was
a
but
the
fresh
print
of
the
in
the
soft
sandy
moist
soil
directed
them
to
the
right
route
and
they
spurred
their
steeds
down
the
declivity
but
with
more
caution
than
the
miserable
nanoo
had
done
suddenly
companion
reined
in
his
steed
and
jumped
off
his
horse
he
picked
up
a
whip
and
held
it
up
is
a
sign
we
are
on
the
right
track
he
said
blacky
has
dropped
his
on
to
his
horse
and
away
again
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
further
both
pulled
in
their
steeds
at
one
impulse
a
garment
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
road
the
agent
again
dismounted
and
picked
up
a
loose
then
he
ran
his
eye
along
the
road
god
he
cried
accident
has
happened
look
at
the
swaying
track
of
the
wheels
their
horses
have
bolted
with
them
and
they
have
all
been
upset
come
he
vaulted
into
his
saddle
as
he
spoke
and
on
they
went
again
heart
beating
almost
audibly
in
fear
that
an
accident
could
only
be
fraught
with
some
frightful
and
fatal
injury
to
flora
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
the
body
of
the
indian
was
discovered
lifeless
upon
the
roadway
he
had
been
struck
with
tremendous
violence
by
the
arm
of
a
tree
and
hurled
like
lightning
to
the
ground
it
was
so
evident
that
he
was
dead
that
neither
attempted
to
dismount
but
both
pressed
on
in
silence
the
agony
of
vivian
it
is
impossible
to
depict
large
drops
of
cold
perspiration
stood
upon
his
forehead
his
features
had
become
livid
and
his
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
his
breast
heaved
and
his
breath
went
and
came
in
short
spasms
he
felt
as
if
he
should
suffocate
a
dreadful
presentiment
chilled
his
blood
and
made
his
marrow
almost
freeze
in
his
bones
he
feared
to
encounter
the
sight
he
anticipated
to
be
awaiting
him
and
yet
he
felt
that
his
steed
seemed
only
to
proceed
at
too
slow
a
pace
and
now
they
reached
the
ruins
hal
uttered
a
cry
of
grief
and
consternation
upon
the
ground
lay
the
shattered
fragments
of
the
carriage
amid
the
of
broken
wall
and
dismantled
masses
of
stone
were
both
horses
frightfully
lacerated
and
bleeding
from
the
desperate
wounds
inflicted
by
their
terrific
collision
the
body
of
the
carriage
which
had
been
forced
half
through
a
low
dilapidated
archway
appeared
to
have
been
owing
to
some
large
blocks
of
stone
on
the
ground
beneath
crushed
by
the
hyperthyrion
of
the
ruined
doorway
and
compressed
to
almost
half
its
natural
height
the
splintered
fragments
sticking
out
here
and
there
showing
how
tremendous
had
been
the
collision
how
frightful
the
destruction
both
men
leaped
from
their
saddles
in
an
instant
and
fastening
their
horses
hastily
at
a
short
distance
from
the
spot
for
both
animals
started
and
betrayed
symptoms
of
terror
either
at
the
scent
of
blood
or
the
confusion
before
them
they
hastened
to
the
carriage
the
silence
of
the
dead
reigned
around
not
even
a
groan
from
within
the
jambed
and
crushed
vehicle
gave
token
of
life
still
remaining
in
the
frames
of
those
whom
hal
knew
it
yet
contained
with
almost
superhuman
strength
hal
forced
open
the
twisted
bent
and
door
a
hurried
sickening
glance
showed
him
the
mangled
body
of
colonel
mires
half
in
the
carriage
and
half
buried
in
the
broken
his
head
and
shoulders
hidden
from
view
by
the
splinters
and
ruins
of
that
part
of
the
vehicle
doubled
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
carriage
appeared
the
forms
of
two
senseless
females
with
a
groan
of
acute
agony
he
wound
his
arms
tenderly
about
one
of
them
and
with
great
difficulty
because
of
his
gentleness
he
contrived
to
liberate
her
he
bore
her
away
from
the
spot
to
a
small
patch
of
grass
and
there
gently
laid
her
down
and
bent
over
to
see
if
any
sign
of
life
remained
it
was
flora
whom
he
had
thus
rescued
and
who
without
a
token
of
life
lay
motionless
the
very
reality
it
seemed
of
death
in
as
fair
a
form
as
was
ever
presented
to
mortal
eye
hal
knelt
by
her
in
a
state
of
frenzy
his
eyes
inflamed
his
throat
swollen
he
appeared
the
incarnation
of
despair
so
intense
was
his
emotion
that
he
was
wholly
without
power
to
move
the
agent
bent
over
the
prostrate
form
of
the
senseless
girl
and
regarded
her
face
with
scrutinising
eyes
he
though
agitated
was
of
course
not
so
deeply
affected
as
his
companion
and
he
exclaimed
alive
she
has
only
fainted
rub
her
hands
briskly
come
too
directly
i
believe
she
is
hurt
she
has
been
frightened
into
a
the
man
commenced
actively
chafing
her
hands
as
he
spoke
hal
who
had
seemed
paralysed
now
followed
his
example
the
friction
upon
her
palms
and
the
cool
air
which
played
upon
her
pallid
features
had
the
desired
effect
and
shortly
her
eyelids
began
to
work
tremulously
then
she
uttered
a
sigh
and
opened
her
eyes
with
a
sudden
motion
she
rose
half
up
looked
wildly
round
her
her
dim
sight
took
in
the
face
of
the
agent
she
turned
from
him
with
a
shudder
and
her
eyes
fell
upon
intensely
anxious
face
within
a
foot
of
her
own
a
low
cry
escaped
her
lips
hal
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
doubt
yet
of
strong
hope
is
even
i
dear
flora
he
ejaculated
hoarsely
through
his
parched
lips
she
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
cried
passionately
me
save
me
hal
save
me
are
saved
he
murmured
almost
inaudibly
and
burying
his
face
on
her
shoulder
gave
way
to
a
paroxysm
of
scalding
tears
it
was
but
for
a
moment
that
this
weakness
overcame
him
had
he
not
suffered
the
gush
of
emotion
to
have
its
course
he
had
fallen
back
in
a
fit
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
raising
up
flora
conducted
her
to
his
horse
he
called
to
his
companion
the
agent
and
bade
him
remain
at
the
scene
of
disaster
until
he
sent
up
help
to
him
and
as
there
was
yet
some
three
miles
to
traverse
before
he
could
reach
the
house
a
lone
one
where
it
had
been
colonel
intention
to
stay
for
some
hours
if
not
all
night
he
mounted
his
horse
and
placing
flora
before
him
went
at
an
easy
canter
from
the
terrible
spot
oh
that
short
ride
of
three
miles
never
before
did
he
experience
such
unalloyed
happiness
as
he
enjoyed
during
the
brief
term
occupied
in
proceeding
from
the
place
of
accident
to
the
inn
flora
saved
from
a
horrible
death
was
in
his
arms
his
left
encircled
her
small
waist
and
her
two
soft
hands
met
and
clasped
about
his
neck
her
now
flushed
cheek
rested
against
his
and
her
gentle
eyes
looked
into
his
own
with
an
expression
of
loving
tenderness
and
a
perfect
sense
of
security
she
was
unconscious
as
yet
of
the
fate
of
colonel
mires
or
his
servants
she
knew
that
she
had
been
on
the
eve
of
some
dreadful
accident
she
had
a
shadowy
sense
of
a
violent
crash
but
nothing
more
she
had
no
wish
to
learn
what
had
really
happened
it
was
enough
to
know
that
she
had
been
wrested
from
the
villanous
custody
of
colonel
mires
and
by
hal
that
was
all
she
cared
for
she
sought
for
no
more
information
and
vivian
who
was
pretty
well
acquainted
with
the
details
forbore
in
her
highly
nervous
state
to
shock
her
by
repeating
them
to
her
on
reaching
the
inn
hal
despatched
the
landlord
and
some
men
to
the
spot
where
colonel
mires
had
met
his
fate
and
upon
making
inquiries
learned
that
at
no
great
distance
was
the
main
leading
to
dorset
and
there
was
a
at
which
he
could
obtain
a
carriage
and
to
return
to
harleydale
he
was
anxious
to
quit
the
inn
for
sake
before
the
dead
bodies
were
brought
in
he
submitted
to
her
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
return
to
harleydale
without
delay
and
she
readily
assented
to
anything
which
he
believed
to
be
for
the
best
leaving
his
tired
steed
and
having
procured
a
seat
for
both
in
a
country
light
cart
they
were
driven
over
to
the
roadside
inn
named
and
there
having
partaken
of
some
slight
refreshment
set
out
in
a
on
their
return
to
harleydale
as
yet
hal
had
not
mentioned
to
flora
a
word
respecting
the
condition
of
her
father
it
was
his
intention
when
her
mind
became
more
calm
to
prepare
her
for
the
event
which
had
taken
place
by
mutual
consent
it
seemed
that
they
banished
all
unpleasant
matters
and
reverted
to
that
which
was
alone
of
absorbing
interest
to
both
their
love
for
each
other
even
this
subject
stole
by
degrees
only
into
the
first
place
in
their
conversation
and
then
hal
honestly
and
honourably
placed
before
her
his
true
position
together
with
the
views
of
the
future
which
he
entertained
and
what
probation
he
must
necessarily
pass
before
he
might
dare
to
look
for
the
realisation
of
the
hope
first
in
his
heart
of
hearts
in
doing
this
he
sketched
the
relation
in
which
she
stood
to
him
pointed
out
how
wide
apart
their
present
stations
were
and
his
own
keen
sense
of
the
fact
so
that
should
she
bend
obedient
to
her
anxious
wish
to
wed
her
to
one
of
her
own
rank
he
felt
it
would
be
unmanly
in
him
to
blame
her
that
it
would
indeed
be
ungenerous
to
think
even
harshly
of
her
for
taking
the
step
and
if
notwithstanding
her
present
impressions
she
fancied
that
she
would
eventually
be
happier
in
uniting
herself
with
the
object
of
her
choice
it
would
be
his
duty
loving
her
so
truly
as
he
did
to
stand
from
her
path
that
she
might
ensure
happiness
on
earth
no
matter
what
might
be
his
own
fate
flora
stayed
his
speech
she
leaned
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
placed
her
hand
in
his
love
you
hal
she
said
answer
all
your
suggestions
and
my
pleadings
and
commands
in
those
words
i
will
give
my
hand
to
no
other
if
not
to
you
and
oh
hal
she
cried
with
an
impetuous
burst
of
feeling
will
cast
away
all
the
wealth
which
is
to
be
mine
the
station
and
its
luxuries
to
share
your
fate
whatever
it
may
be
if
you
will
have
me
i
look
with
fright
and
horror
upon
any
other
future
i
can
endure
anything
with
you
submit
with
a
smile
to
the
frowns
of
fate
bear
cheerfully
any
ills
which
may
arise
you
know
hal
poverty
ought
not
to
scare
me
i
can
bear
troubles
and
trials
with
you
i
can
bear
nothing
if
i
am
to
be
torn
from
you
and
given
to
own
darling
flora
cried
hal
pressing
her
tenderly
to
his
heart
a
flush
of
heat
rushed
to
his
forehead
and
his
cheeks
his
heart
beat
rapidly
for
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
but
to
ask
her
now
to
return
no
more
to
her
home
but
to
give
to
him
at
once
her
hand
and
thus
set
the
machinations
or
the
claims
of
all
other
lovers
at
defiance
it
was
a
fearful
moment
of
temptation
he
drew
a
long
breath
you
not
flora
marry
lester
vane
he
said
in
an
undertone
of
deep
earnestness
will
die
first
hal
she
replied
with
equal
fervour
he
pressed
his
hands
to
his
throbbing
temples
he
laid
his
clenched
fist
upon
his
heart
he
thought
of
beauty
and
her
tenderness
then
he
thought
too
of
her
guileless
innocence
a
fearful
struggle
ensued
between
love
honour
and
duty
she
would
fly
with
him
and
give
her
hand
to
him
at
a
word
that
he
knew
he
so
adored
her
and
his
chances
of
obtaining
her
save
by
elopement
were
so
very
very
remote
the
temptation
was
a
sore
one
to
wrestle
with
chapter
the
reward
of
faithfulness
and
truth
work
then
with
steadfast
hope
and
hand

kington

wilton
with
the
impetuosity
natural
to
his
character
had
after
his
last
interview
with
lotte
clinton
determined
on
leaving
her
residence
that
another
hours
should
close
his
account
with
england
and
all
it
contained
the
first
steamer
bound
for
a
distant
port
should
convey
him
no

whither
it
was
destined
a
selfish
inexorable
parent
a
love
he
would
leave
behind
him
for
ever
and
in
some
wild
exciting
service
under
the
flag
of
a
nation
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
he
resolved
to
endeavour
to
forget
the
cause
of
his
present
unhappiness
in
the
heat
of
his
wrath
against
his
parent
especially
he
encountered
charles
clinton
and
from
him
learned
that
his
father
had
been
struck
down
by
the
bullet
of
an
assassin
and
for
all
that
was
at
the
moment
known
lay
at
the
point
of
death
the
natural
impulse
of
a
generous
and
affectionate
heart
effected
an
instant
revulsion
of
feeling
and
the
steamer
was
at
once
abandoned
for
the
train
to
harleydale
before
the
night
closed
in
he
was
with
an
able
surgeon
at
his
bedside
as
he
gazed
upon
the
old
ashy
face
his
closed
eyes
the
furrowed
wrinkles
traces
of
care
and
long
suffering
all
angry
rebellious
animosity
took
wing
he
knelt
down
by
the
couch
and
with
falling
tears
prayed
earnestly
for
him
against
whom
so
few
hours
back
his
heart
had
been
so
fiercely
moved
the
surgeon
after
a
careful
examination
reported
that
the
wound
received
by
old
wilton
though
severe
was
neither
fatal
nor
in
itself
dangerous
but
the
shock
it
had
occasioned
to
the
system
of
an
aged
and
feeble
man
was
essentially
the
latter
in
fact
the
prostration
it
had
produced
rendered
his
condition
highly
critical
the
surgeon
plainly
said
that
extraordinary
care
and
unceasing
tending
and
nursing
could
alone
save
him
and
he
impressed
it
upon
mind
that
failure
in
the
duties
would
be
fatal
to
his
father
it
was
necessary
that
flora
should
be
made
acquainted
with
the
directions
of
the
surgeon
and
mark
surprised
at
not
seeing
her
with
her
father
sent
for
her
believing
that
agony
and
fright
had
compelled
her
to
retire
to
her
chamber
he
was
astounded
to
learn
that
she
was
not
in
the
house
that
she
had
quitted
the
hall
in
the
morning
and
had
not
returned
and
though
messengers
had
been
despatched
in
every
direction
in
search
of
her
she
could
not
only
not
be
found
but
no
tidings
could
be
gained
of
her
this
was
a
new
blow
to
him
he
felt
distracted
and
bewildered
he
could
suggest
to
himself
nothing
to
account
for
her
absence
but
some
frightful
and
fatal
accident
he
dare
not
leave
his
side
to
search
for
her
and
the
people
by
whom
he
was
attended
or
to
whom
he
might
apply
appeared
to
have
done
all
in
their
power
but
in
vain
to
gain
tidings
of
her
while
racking
his
brain
to
devise
a
means
of
instantly
instituting
a
fresh
search
for
her
his
father
roused
himself
from
his
previous
lethargic
condition
and
gazed
feebly
around
him
as
his
dull
eyes
fell
upon
mark
they
brightened
up
a
smile
of
affection
passed
over
his
ghastly
features
and
he
pressed
the
hand
with
which
mark
clasped
his
again
his
eyes
wandered
round
the
bedside
twice
thrice
then
he
turned
to
mark
with
a
disappointed
look
his
lips
moved
and
in
a
faint
tone
he
murmured
what
was
to
be
said
with
an
air
of
embarrassment
mark
responded
is
in
her
room
she
is
not
well
frightened
unable
to
support
this
shocking
the
old
man
shook
his
head
feebly
have
been
harsh
and
selfish
to
her
he
said
have
endeavoured
to
enforce
my
will
against
her
hopes
of
future
happiness
and
she
does
not
forget
it
he
turned
his
face
away
with
an
air
of
pain
and
sorrowful
discontent
of
exciting
his
mind
in
any
shape
whispered
the
surgeon
is
too
exhausted
to
sustain
mark
bent
over
his
father
and
whispered
in
his
ear
not
wrong
flora
dear
sir
he
said
will
be
here
shortly
and
her
absence
shall
be
satisfactorily
explained
to
as
the
surgeon
imposed
implicit
silence
mark
sat
down
to
reflect
upon
what
course
was
to
be
pursued
respecting
unaccountable
disappearance
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
his
friend
harry
vivian
would
be
the
individual
to
apply
to
for
assistance
there
was
no
doubt
on
his
mind
that
he
would
do
his
utmost
to
ascertain
what
had
befallen
her
and
to
restore
her
in
safety
if
such
happy
issue
was
to
attend
the
mystery
of
her
absence
as
soon
as
the
suggestion
presented
itself
he
despatched
a
servant
to
the
station
with
a
telegraphic
message
to
vivian
paying
for
the
return
message
instructing
him
to
come
down
to
harleydale
at
once
even
to
engage
a
special
train
the
cost
of
which
he
mark
would
defray
for
the
matter
on
which
he
desired
to
confer
with
him
admitted
of
no
delay
an
answer
was
received
in
a
brief
period
which
ran
thus
from
home
gone
not
known
where
return
not
known
this
was
a
climax
and
he
reseated
himself
by
the
bedside
his
mind
tortured
by
doubts
respecting
the
fate
of
his
father
and
of
his
sister
and
agonized
by
his
remembrances
of
his
parting
with
lotte
clinton
the
surgeon
had
retired
for
the
night
having
given
his
parting
directions
old
wilton
lay
in
a
motionless
slumber
produced
by
an
opiate
the
old
housekeeper
flitted
about
the
room
like
a
phantom
and
mark
with
folded
arms
and
eyes
fastened
on
vacancy
still
continued
successively
calling
up
dreamy
visions
inspired
by
a
new
hope
communicated
to
his
heart
by
his
fond
smile
and
affectionate
manner
to
him
he
shaped
out
schemes
to
conquer
his
repugnance
to
marriage
with
lotte
clinton
what
if
he
were
to
present
her
with
the
whole
of
the
money
he
had
brought
from
abroad
with
him
a
girl
with
a
dowry
of
upwards
of
six
thousand
pounds
was
hardly
one
even
for
his
father
to
reject
but
would
she
accept
it
if
he
offered
it
to
her
this
sempstress
so
proud
so
so
clear
in
her
perceptions
so
firm
in
her
resolves
so
undeviating
in
her
spirit
of
rectitude
well
he
might
bestow
it
upon
her
anonymously
and
then
contrive
an
accidental
meeting
with
her
he
might
hark
rolling
over
the
gravelled
path
and
stopping
before
the
mark
sprang
to
his
feet
it
must
be
flora
returned
it
was
flora
and
hal
too
he
met
them
in
the
hall
both
entering
in
with
grave
faces
and
soft
step
and
the
temptation
it
had
been
triumphed
over
hal
had
battled
with
it
manfully
but
love
and
passion
and
fears
of
losing
so
dear
a
treasure
had
fastened
upon
honour
and
all
but
strangled
it
in
his
dire
extremity
hal
called
upon
flora
and
unfolded
the
conflict
going
on
within
his
heart
to
her
view
he
asked
her
for
counsel
and
for
argument
to
combat
the
incentives
tugging
at
his
urging
him
to
do
with
her
free
consent
what
colonel
mires
had
sought
to
do
without
it
she
could
only
weep
and
tremble
and
alas
for
she
too
could
not
bear
to
think
that
they
must
part
for
ever
leave
in
his
hands
the
momentous
decision
his
honour
was
however
of
stubborn
material
it
continued
its
exertion
in
spite
of
the
formidable
antagonists
it
had
to
contend
with
and
there
stepped
to
its
aid
at
an
opportune
moment
the
remembrance
of
the
wound
inflicted
on
old
wilton
by
chewkle
hal
at
once
broke
to
flora
the
event
of
the
morning
it
saved
them
both
they
continued
their
journey
to
harleydale
scarce
a
word
passing
between
them
when
at
the
hall
they
met
mark
flora
flung
herself
upon
her
neck
and
sobbed
from
more
causes
than
one
not
alarmed
dear
whispered
mark
surgeon
says
there
is
no
danger
he
only
wants
good
nursing
you
will
do
all
that
i
flora
almost
sank
to
the
earth
i
had
left
him
she
thought
and
only
waving
her
hand
to
hal
tottered
to
her
room
i
had
induced
her
to
fly
with
me
thought
hal
and
instinctively
smote
his
breast
mark
wrung
his
hand
warmly
have
saved
her
he
said
whom
replied
hal
laconically
from
myself
he
might
have
added
mark
started
in
astonishment
him
he
ejaculated
then
he
said
matter
whom
she
is
back
safe
again
you
are
pale
and
fagged
you
must
have
some
rest
i
will
hear
you
recount
what
has
passed
after
you
have
risen
in
the
they
separated
for
hal
was
only
too
glad
to
be
alone
too
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
of
making
his
acknowledgments
of
joy
at
having
conquered
his
great
temptation
and
when
he
flung
himself
exhausted
on
his
bed
mark
returned
to
his
room
to
find
there
flora
upon
her
knees
in
prayer
and
ruthful
though
silent
chapter
how
lotte
fulfilled
her
trust
among
the
faithless
faithful
only
she
among
innumerable
false
unmoved
unshaken
unseduced
unterrified
her
loyalty
she
kept
her
love
her
zeal
nor
number
nor
example
with
her
wrought
to
swerve
from
truth
or
change
her
constant
mind
milton
and
now
lotte
clinton
was
again
alone
in
the
world
with
her
face
confronting
her
situation
prepared
to
sustain
her
cross
with
the
meek
fortitude
she
had
always
hitherto
displayed
she
had
nourished
in
secret
her
hope
that
one
day
she
should
meet
with
some
singleminded
youth
who
would
love
her
for
herself
and
whom
she
should
love
and
heartily
too
for
the
selfsame
qualification
it
was
only
the
natural
promptings
of
a
young
heart
it
would
indeed
have
been
unnatural
for
her
not
to
have
entertained
some
such
notion
she
had
met
the
man
who
had
gained
her
heart
her
first
love
her
idolatry
he
was
not
the
man
she
had
pictured
she
had
never
sketched
out
such
a
figure
such
a
face
as
mark
possessed
she
had
never
indeed
created
a
model
she
had
hoped
only
for
a
manly
loving
heart
and
mark
presented
himself
carrying
off
her
affection
by
a
de
without
any
of
those
considerations
she
had
deemed
essential
to
love
being
consulted
in
the
matter
oh
she
loved
him
truly
dearly
faithfully
and
with
the
most
pure
unselfishness
no
greater
happiness
could
she
conceive
than
being
his
wife
yet
to
her
clear
mind
there
were
duties
superior
to
her
deep
affection
and
she
bent
to
them
she
swerved
not
from
them
even
though
her
heart
broke
in
the
task
the
night
that
mark
went
away
she
prayed
for
his
happiness
with
earnest
sincerity
and
though
she
might
never
never
see
him
more
and
her
future
life
be
thus
made
sad
and
cheerless
she
sent
up
an
entreaty
that
their
separation
might
never
sit
heavy
on
his
heart
a
week
had
passed
away
she
was
pale
and
a
dull
settled
expression
had
fastened
itself
upon
her
once
lively
intelligent
open
face
she
had
not
seen
her
brother
charley
since
departure
and
her
only
solace
had
been
helen
child
she
had
hitherto
loved
it
now
she
doated
upon
it
it
seemed
all
that
she
had
left
to
love
and
to
love
her
for
that
the
child
was
most
fondly
attached
to
her
there
could
be
no
doubt
she
had
had
him
christened
by
the
name
of
hugh
riversdale
grahame
and
she
had
stood
as
godmother
to
him
resolving
to
fulfill
firmly
faithfully
and
justly
that
sacred
responsibility
in
the
absence
of
his
own
mother
of
whom
since
the
night
she
left
her
so
strangely
she
had
nothing
heard
one
morning
she
was
seated
alone
she
had
laid
the
little
hugh
down
in
his
tiny
bed
for
his
sleep
and
she
was
bending
over
her
work
with
her
accustomed
close
application
she
thought
of
mark
it
was
not
possible
to
keep
down
thoughts
of
him
he
never
would
come
back
to
her
there
seemed
little
doubt
of
that
how
indeed
she
hardly
hoped
for
it
hardly
wished
for
it
for
despite
her
adoration
of
him
was
no
less
she
seemed
to
feel
acutely
disparity
of
their
positions
and
that
it
would
have
proved
an
effectual
barrier
to
their
peace
if
united
she
thought
of
his
parting
words
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
would
not
bid
her
adieu
he
felt
their
parting
so
deeply
yes
he
loved
her
she
was
sure
of
that
and
an
involuntary
bless
him
escaped
her
lips
as
her
head
sank
upon
her
bosom
and
the
fast
falling
tears
bedewed
the
work
in
her
trembling
hands
sweet
sweet
chirruped
the
little
canary
little
dick
she
thought
as
the
rapidly
repeated
call
attracted
her
attention
little
darling
sees
that
i
am
sad
and
would
comfort
she
raised
her
eyes
and
lo
a
woman
stood
before
her
one
glance
it
was
helen
grahame
with
an
almost
suffocating
cry
lotte
rose
to
her
feet
helen
clasped
her
hands
and
cowered
before
her
lotte
lotte
she
murmured
had
she
have
spoken
and
explained
for
a
thousand
years
she
could
not
have
so
clearly
convinced
lotte
that
her
mysterious
absence
had
been
involuntary
as
she
did
by
the
utterance
of
those
two
words
see
it
all
i
see
it
all
she
exclaimed
with
jut
quivering
lips
are
not
to
blame
miss
helen
with
a
gasp
of
ecstacy
caught
lotte
in
her
arms
she
embraced
her
passionately
lotte
my
sweet
faithful
enduring
friend
she
sobbed

i
not
owe
to
you

me
how
in
some
way
i
may
try
to
repay
you
for
all
the
suffering
i
have
occasioned
you
for
your
faithfulness
for
your
blessed
charity
for
your
dear

womanly
sympathies
and
for
that
service
inestimable
in
its
value
which
never
never
fainting
under
its
sharp
exactions
you
have
rendered
me
oh
lotte
my
own
darling
lotte
had
you
been
my
sister
a
fond
unselfish
sister
i
might
have
expected
some
such
ministering
but
from
you
on
whom
i
had
no
claim
not
even
that
of
mere
acquaintanceship
how
can
i
sufficiently
appreciate
it
how
strive
to
evince
to
you
the
feeling
it
has
raised
up
in
my
heart
toward
you
heaven

try
to
show
you
how
i
estimate

it
with
me
no
lotte

love

truest
dearest

all
you

in
the
world
when

no
prospect

and
no
wish
on
your
part
that

should
return

share
it
all
with

my
wish
my
husband
lotte
my
husband
my
little
father
her
voice
sank
low
and
she
hid
her
weeping
eyes
on
neck
what
not
a
word
lotte
not
one
little
word
to
say
no
not
one
at
another
time
she
would
have
pressed
some
composure
into
her
service
had
it
been
ever
so
small
now
she
could
not
keep
back
her
deep
emotion
nor
enlist
a
word
to
express
even
one
of
the
many
thoughts
crowding
crashing
through
her
brain
her
whole
frame
appeared
convulsed
she
staggered
as
if
she
would
sink
to
the
seat
but
helen
clung
to
her
sustained
her
laid
her
weeping
face
upon
her
bosom
thou
there
darling
she
murmured
lotte
i
am
so
happy
to
hold
you
again
in
my
arms
no
more
struggles
with
the
world
lotte
no
more
unthreading
of
the
web
of
life
with
a
threaded
needle
dry
your
tears
my
own
darling
and
true
heart
for
if
one
mortal
can
ensure
happiness
i
will
compass
happiness
and
parted
for
ever
from
mark
lotte
could
not
refrain
weeping
and
helen
finding
it
was
so
hushed
her
own
quivering
voice
and
wiped
the
trembling
lids
of
lotte
and
kissed
her
pale
cheek
and
forehead
pressing
her
again
and
again
to
her
heart
lotte
at
length
summoned
her
old
strength
of
purpose
and
putting
down
with
a
firm
hand
the
uprising
thoughts
of
her
still
desolate
and
lonely
condition
in
life
she
strove
to
obey
injunctions
to
light
up
her
sweet
pleasant
eyes
with
a
smile
and
after
one
or
two
efforts
she
cleared
her
aching
throat
so
as
to
speak
all
sincerity
she
said
am
happy
oh
very
happy
to
see
you
again
and
to
hear
such
glad
tidings
but
i
i
am
sure
i
ought
not
to
be
thus
encircled
by
your
kind
arms
you
overrate
what
i
have
done
and
our
stations
helen
placed
her
hands
over
her
mouth
not
pain
my
heart
lotte
do
not
wound
me
if
you
talk
to
me
in
that
strain
i
shall
fear
that
the
old
contemptible
pride
i
once
possessed
had
made
me
act
so
as
to
cause
you
to
believe
that
i
am
hollow
and
deceptive
and
eaten
up
with
a
fatuity
of
which
i
have
long
known
the
worthlessness
you
have
taught
me
that
difference
of
station
is
levelled
by
human
worth
what
do
i
say
oh
lotte
no
station
is
so
high
as
that
held
by
one
in
right
of
truth
and
honour
and
virtue
station
lotte
if
it
were
of
us
two
to
kneel
to
the
one
most
elevated
and
entitled
to
the
exercise
of
a
noble
pride
it
would
be
for
me
to
bend
my
knee
lotte
placed
her
hand
before
mouth
is
my
turn
now
she
said
with
a
playful
smile
sad
though
its
expression
still
was
do
not
speak
to
me
about
myself
she
added
almost
mournfully
indeed
it
makes
me
feel
embarrassed
and
uncomfortable
but
let
us
talk
of
him
in
search
of
whom
in
spite
of
your
tender
and
kind
words
to
me
your
anxious
eyes
are
wandering
little
boy
my
dear
dear
boy
where
is
he
said
helen
with
a
spasmodic
action
of
her
throat
as
she
clutched
shoulder
lotte
smiled
again
one
of
her
old
sweet
smiles
is
so
well
and
so
beautiful
she
whispered
such
a
dear
dear
little
she
took
hand
and
on
tiptoe
they
went
together
into
the
adjoining
room
in
a
small
wicker
daintily
trimmed
with
white
muslin
and
pink
ribbons
which
had
cost
lotte
at
least
a
dozen
dinners
if
not
more
lay
sleeping
child
and
he
lay
there
a
very
picture
he
slept
lightly
and
pleasantly
and
seemed
a
very
cherub
of
happiness
the
devoted
attention
paid
to
him
was
evidenced
in
his
own
appearance
and
in
everything
surrounding
him
once
again
helen
caught
lotte
in
her
arms
and
passionately
kissed
her
and
sobbed
wildly
then
she
released
herself
and
suddenly
hurried
from
the
room
to
intense
surprise
she
was
about
to
follow
her
when
she
saw
her
hastening
back
light
of
foot
bringing
with
her
a
gentleman
lotte
was
at
no
loss
to
guess
who
he
was
helen
led
her
husband
to
the
side
of
the
sleeping
child
she
pointed
to
it
and
in
low
quivering
tones
she
exclaimed
has
she
fulfilled
her
trust
hugh
gazed
on
his
child
and
then
he
turned
to
lotte
she
could
see
his
eyes
were
humid
he
caught
her
hands
and
sank
on
his
knees
with
a
sudden
impulse
before
her
she
started
and
as
he
pressed
his
lips
almost
impetuously
on
her
hands
she
struggled
to
withdraw
them
crying
rise
sir
pray
do
i
entreat
you
to
do
so
you
distress
me
you
pain
me
indeed
you
but
hugh
still
detained
her
me
he
said
speaking
rapidly
and
earnestly
position
is
not
derogatory
to
me
it
is
a
tribute
to
your
worth
this
is
no
occasion
for
cold
form
i
kneel
to
you
in
intense
thankfulness
it
is
the
prompting
the
outpouring
of
a
full
heart
you
saved
my
helen
she
who
is
dearer
to
me
than
life
itself
you
have
saved
and
tenderly
nurtured
our
child
by
these
two
acts
you
have
also
rescued
me
from
destruction
and
eternal
perdition
i
kneel
to
you
that
i
may
give
some
sign
of
the
keen
sense
of
my
indebtedness
to
you
that
you
may
in
the
coming
time
feel
entitled
to
the
position
in
which
it
is
my
intention
to
place
you
justly
entitled
without
one
shrinking
impulse
or
doubting
impression
on
my
knees
i
thank
he
rose
up
my
heart
i
treasure
the
memory
of
your
service
and
by
my
future
acts
i
will
strive
to
show
how
deeply
and
dearly
i
estimate
lotte
faltered
out
some
confused
response
and
ran
out
of
the
room
to
conceal
her
emotion
by
this
time
the
little
fellow
nestled
in
the
cradle
had
opened
his
infantile
eyes
and
turning
them
upon
his
mother
smiled
to
be
sure
she
caught
him
up
enraptured
and
pressing
him
to
her
heart
covered
him
with
a
thousand
kisses
and
then
he
was
called
upon
to
undergo
the
same
process
at
the
hands
and
lips
of
his
father
then
they
adjourned
bearing
their
little
treasure
with
them
to
the
adjoining
apartment
where
they
found
lotte
trying
to
get
up
an
appearance
as
though
she
had
no
notion
of
tears
ah
helen
watched
her
expressive
face
perused
its
lineaments
with
attentive
scrutiny
and
she
saw
there
written
a
sadness
too
deep
and
settled
to
be
ousted
by
any
attempt
to
smile
and
seem
gratified
and
overjoyed
at
happiness
not
but
that
lotte
delighted
at
evident
felicity
yet
the
surrender
of
her
young
pure
heart
to
one
who
was
gone
no
more
to
return
to
her
was
a
grief
which
resisted
all
her
efforts
to
bury
it
deep
in
her
own
bosom
without
leaving
an
outward
sign
to
mark
its
grave
helen
so
well
versed
in
the
language
of
heart
interpreted
by
her
sweet
sad
eyes
and
the
play
of
her
features
that
there
was
hidden
anguish
which
at
whatever
cost
of
pain
she
sought
to
conceal
so
that
it
might
not
disturb
her
happiness
will
probe
to
that
sorrow
thought
helen
if
it
is
to
be
rooted
out
it
shall
have
no
home
in
her
dear
she
however
said
nothing
upon
that
subject
now
she
explained
those
causes
for
her
absence
and
silence
which
which
the
reader
is
acquainted
adding
that
the
her
husband
had
taken
her
had
rapidly
produced
the
desired
effect
for
they
had
scarcely
landed
when
she
was
fully
restored
to
her
intellect
remembered
all
that
had
happened
and
did
not
rest
until
she
was
on
her
homeward
voyage
indeed
until
she
had
discovered
lotte
and
presented
herself
before
her
mutual
revelations
were
made
lotte
furnishing
a
history
of
what
had
happened
to
her
since
helen
had
left
her
omitting
from
the
narration
the
character
of
mark
wilton
when
all
these
recitals
had
ended
helen
made
known
her
intention
of
not
leaving
the
apartments
in
which
they
were
sitting
without
lotte
the
latter
shook
her
head
with
a
sad
smile
on
her
face
as
the
announcement
was
made
to
her
but
helen
with
great
decision
declined
to
accept
any
denial
from
her
am
prepared
for
all
your
objections
she
said
fact
lotte
i
have
invented
some
for
you
and
have
discussed
them
with
hugh
only
to
most
triumphantly
defeat
them
every
then
she
ran
hastily
over
them
suggesting
all
that
lotte
really
did
feel
in
opposition
to
the
scheme
with
much
more
but
only
to
answer
and
refute
all
the
adverse
arguments
and
so
lotte
was
to
be
a
lady
after
all
to
have
a
fortune
and
ride
in
a
carriage
of
her
own
the
wealth
to
which
hugh
had
succeeded
would
enable
him
to
settle
upon
her
an
amount
that
would
do
this
without
in
any
degree
inconveniently
trenching
upon
his
very
large
resources
and
as
there
was
really
no
consistent
argument
she
could
offer
for
its
rejection
she
with
swimming
eyes
of
gratefulness
expressed
her
thanks
and
her
hopes
to
be
proved
worthy
such
generous
liberality
perhaps
there
was
some
latent
incentive
which
might
have
helped
to
overcome
her
indisposition
to
accept
an
obligation
so
great
and
perhaps
a
flush
heightened
the
hue
of
her
features
as
a
passing
thought
suggested
the
poor
sempstress
passing
before
the
eyes
of
old
wilton
in
her
own
carriage
even
though
he
refused
to
receive
her
into
his
family
helen
kissed
her
cheek
affectionately
and
said
delightedly
is
nothing
then
to
step
in
between
our
your
humble
servant
said
a
strange
voice
both
females
uttered
a
startled
cry
and
hugh
jumped
up
and
turned
upon
the
intruder
it
was
nathan
gomer
who
stood
near
the
door
the
same
strange
almost
unearthly
grin
was
upon
his
face
as
usual
and
he
chuckled
as
he
observed
the
utter
surprise
with
which
he
was
regarded
neither
helen
nor
her
husband
knew
him
the
former
gazed
on
him
with
terror
the
latter
with
haughty
indignation
at
what
he
considered
rude
audacity
lotte
knew
him
in
an
instant
though
she
had
seen
him
but
once
when
he
suddenly
appeared
as
the
friend
of
flora
wilton
in
the
old
abode
at
clerkenwell
in
an
instant
she
felt
sure
that
his
visit
was
to
her
and
she
had
a
strange
presentiment
that
whatever
he
directed
her
to
do
she
must
perform
all
remained
silent
for
a
minute
then
nathan
smiled
seem
slightly
astonished
he
said
expect
to
see
me
ha
ha
fond
of
creating
a
sensation
you
know
me
he
said
nodding
to
helen
do
he
exclaimed
to
lotte
i
have
business
with
you
both
firstly
miss
clinton
understand
that
i
have
had
your
character
painted
to
me
in
most
glowing
language
by
a
young
man
nay
never
turn
so
crimson
for
the
young
lady
by
your
side
has
just
described
you
in
highly
favourable
terms
and
it
is
not
the
custom
for
young
ladies
to
fall
into
extravagancies
of
encomium
upon
individuals
of
their
own
sex
so
you
ought
not
to
look
so
very
rosy
when
you
hear
that
a
young
man
extolled
your
virtues
even
more
highly
than
he
did
your
pretty
face
and
form
i
expect
you
however
to
continue
the
colour
on
your
brow
when
i
say
that
having
investigated
the
truth
of
his
allegations
i
have
found
not
one
over
estimated
that
you
are
truly
worthy
of
and
deserving
the
reward
which
your
friend
at
your
side
has
offered
to
your
superior
merits
you
knew
how
distasteful
to
my
ears
are
these
praises
interrupted
lotte
gravely
sir
you
would
not
follow
the
example
of
generous
people
whose
extreme
kindness
of
heart
leads
them
to
speak
and
to
think
far
too
highly
of
me
it
is
as
if
truthfulness
faithfulness
and
singleness
of
purpose
were
not
common
to
us
yes
very
good
returned
nathan
only
thing
is
that
the
possession
of
all
those
qualities
by
one
individual
is
uncommon
a
leetle
say
uncommon
but
i
if
you
wish
it
tell
you
what
i
think
but
i
will
ask
you
if
you
will
be
guilty
of
one
more
act
of
unselfish
service
you
have
just
entered
into
an
arrangement
fraught
with
every
possible
comfort
and
happiness
i
have
come
to
place
myself
between
you
and
the
realization
of
immunity
from
care
privation
and
unwearying
toil
to
be
brief
wilton
senior
has
been
wounded
by
an
assassin
and
lies
helpless
and
delirious
upon
his
bed
at
harleydale
his
daughter
flora
you
know
her
well
of
course
also
has
been
placed
in
a
position
of
danger
which
together
with
the
shock
occasioned
by
the
attack
on
her
father
has
placed
her
on
a
bed
of
sickness
wilton
has
none
but
hired
nurses
therefore
now
mark
wilton
lotte
turned
pale
at
the
name
nathan
saw
it
he
cleared
his
throat
say
that
mark
wilton
bethought
himself
of
you
i
will
not
pretend
to
enter
on
all
the
incentives
which
induced
him
to
request
you
to
take
the
unthankful
and
trying
office
of
nurse
to
his
father
at
least
in
tending
him
more
as
a
he
laid
a
strong
emphasis
on
that
word
as
a
nurse
no
doubt
he
will
satisfactorily
explain
himself
to
you
but
i
may
say
that
knowing
all
the
circumstances
i
feel
that
the
request
is
a
strong
one
its
compliance
hardly
to
be
expected
and
that
some
more
than
common
motive
has
led
to
the
suggestion
however
as
requested
i
put
the
proposition
to
you
it
is
for
you
to
accept
or
decline
before
he
had
finished
ten
thousand
reasons
why
she
should
not
go
had
flashed
through
her
brain
yet
the
one
idea
her
love
for
mark
determined
her
to
comply
with
wish
she
was
one
who
never
let
the
sun
go
down
on
her
wrath
she
had
forgiven
old
harsh
words
although
they
had
so
pained
her
now
she
had
no
hope
that
all
the
attention
care
and
service
she
might
be
called
upon
to
bestow
would
remove
his
objections
to
her
nevertheless
she
should
be
able
to
do
some
good
for
sake
and
if
the
parting
with
him
for
ever
took
place
beneath
the
roof
of
his
father
it
would
not
be
embittered
at
least
by
the
remembrance
that
she
had
granted
the
aid
he
had
asked
of
her
she
wiped
hastily
from
her
eyelids
the
tears
which
memories
awakened
by
nathan
gomer
had
gathered
there
and
said
to
him
simply
will
go
with
you
sir
to
for
a
moment
the
nostrils
of
nathan
were
widely
inflated
and
he
gave
a
very
perceptible
gulp
he
ejaculated
clearing
his
throat
will
be
off
in
two
hours
from
this
so
lassie
make
your
preparations
and
only
one
box
if
you
please
i
say
only
one
then
he
turned
to
helen
and
said
i
know
you
though
you
are
unacquainted
with
me
pardon
me
if
i
tell
you
matters
are
going
on
sadly
in
your
house
the
family
pride
has
had
a
dreadful
fall
your
father
is
absent
your
sister
margaret
has
i
say
your
sister
margaret
has
left
her
home
and
your
mother
is
confined
to
her
bed
in
serious
illness
with
evangeline
your
sister
as
her
sole
attendant
for
the
myrmidons
of
the
law
are
in
the
house
and
the
servants
have
helen
listened
to
him
like
one
in
a
dream
then
she
turned
to
her
husband
and
said
to
him
we
will
proceed
there
this
he
silently
but
readily
acquiesced
and
with
a
few
hasty
loving
words
to
lotte
concerning
the
future
helen
embraced
her
and
departed
taking
with
her
and
her
husband
two
hours
subsequently
lotte
clinton
in
the
careful
charge
of
nathan
gomer
was
on
her
way
to
harleydale
wondering
what
new
trial
fate
had
in
store
for
her
chapter
lotte
clinton
and
old
wilton
there
is
a
kind
of
character
in
thy
life
that
to
the
observer
doth
thy
history
fully
unfold
thyself
and
thy
belongings
art
not
thine
own
so
proper
as
to
waste
thyself
upon
thy
virtues
they
or
thee
heaven
doth
with
us
as
we
with
torches
do
not
light
them
for
themselves
for
if
our
virtues
did
not
go
forth
of
us
all
alike
as
if
we
had
them
not
spirits
are
not
finely
touched
but
to
fine
issues
shakspere
it
is
not
easy
to
conceive
nor
to
clearly
explain
the
true
motives
which
induced
lotte
clinton
to
give
her
assent
to
the
unexpected
proposition
made
to
her
by
nathan
gomer
in
no
view
was
it
pleasing
to
her
or
calculated
to
afford
her
aught
but
embarrassment
pain
ungenerous
insult
what
indeed
was
it
less
than
insult
to
ask
her
to
tend
the
man
in
his
helplessness
who
in
his
strength
and
pride
had
stigmatised
her
as
alas
she
could
not
look
upon
the
present
request
as
a
compliment
to
her
there
was
no
phase
in
which
it
could
take
that
shape
it
held
out
no
prospect
of
effecting
the
realization
of
what
had
once
been
so
recently
too
afondly
though
timidly
cherished
hope
there
was
no
prospect
indeed
but
that
she
would
be
harassed
by
appeals
and
urgings
and
pained
and
sorely
tried
by
the
denials
he
would
force
from
her
lips
what
was
she
to
expect
when
wilton
recovered
his
senses
and
became
conscious
of
her
presence
would
he
not
believe
that
she
had
meanly
and
surreptitiously
contrived
to
gain
admission
to
his
house
during
his
prostration
with
the
object
of
availing
herself
of
the
opportunity
to
fix
more
indelibly
his
passion
for
her
in
his
heart
what
would
naturally
be
his
conduct
and
his
language
to
her
under
such
an
impression
respecting
flora
she
conjectured
little
she
knew
her
to
be
kind
and
gentle
but
the
same
influences
which
had
affected
her
father
when
an
alliance
was
the
subject
of
consideration
might
have
their
effect
upon
her
too
she
wished
mark
had
not
sent
for
her
yet
withal
she
would
not
have
rejected
the
entreaty
for
worlds
no
beset
as
the
task
would
necessarily
be
with
possible
vexations
trials
and
contumely
she
determined
to
go
through
with
it
still
she
thought
mark
should
not
have
asked
this
of
her
to
refuse
was
not
indeed
possible
to
her
no
even
if
it
cost
her
that
fortune
and
ease
which
helen
riversdale
had
promised
her
she
did
not
once
ask
herself
why
if
she
would
not
have
answered
that
question
who
else
should
make
the
attempt
she
did
not
dream
that
mark
wilton
was
wholly
guiltless
of
the
message
nathan
gomer
conveyed
to
her
or
that
in
meeting
with
him
she
should
have
to
undergo
an
ordeal
she
could
not
under
the
circumstances
have
contemplated
the
journey
to
harleydale
was
performed
rapidly
nathan
gomer
rendered
himself
as
amiable
and
as
entertaining
as
he
could
until
lotte
thought
it
was
a
pity
he
was
so
short
so
extremely
yellow
and
ugly
for
really
he
was
a
cheerful
dear
little
old
man
on
reaching
the
hall
nathan
learned
that
mark
was
alone
in
one
of
the
and
forbidding
the
servant
to
announce
him
his
usual
custom
he
took
lotte
by
the
hand
and
pressing
it
as
if
to
reassure
her
he
with
noiseless
step
approached
the
room
to
which
he
had
been
directed
he
found
the
door
ajar
and
he
peeped
in
he
raised
his
finger
to
lotte
to
be
silent
and
opening
the
door
without
a
sound
he
advanced
with
his
trembling
companion
to
the
shoulder
of
mark
wilton
who
was
seated
gazing
abstractedly
out
of
the
window
upon
the
lovely
landscape
which
stretched
far
away
into
the
distance
lotte
did
not
like
the
process
but
really
nathan
had
so
much
instinctive
influence
that
she
took
part
in
the
proceedings
unresistingly
and
without
remark
she
quickly
wished
she
had
not
done
so
mark
who
was
sitting
with
his
arms
folded
suddenly
released
them
pressed
his
hands
forcibly
together
and
ejaculated
lotte
lotte
cruel
girl
you
have
no
faith
in
my
endearing
love
you
have
coldly
sacrificed
my
heart
my
life
to
a
chimera
nathan
instantly
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
he
started
up
and
turned
round
uttering
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
he
staggered
back
several
paces
for
his
rapid
glance
had
fallen
upon
downcast
and
grave
features
practice
master
mark
that
of
audibly
soliloquising
it
is
a
failing
of
mine
exclaimed
nathan
gomer
sharply
the
results
of
my
experience
has
got
me
into
scrapes
which
money
has
hardly
succeeded
in
plucking
me
out
am
not
dreaming
cried
mark
pressing
his
hand
to
his
forehead
then
he
rushed
forward
and
seized
passive
hand
lotte
sweet
lotte
he
cried
what
happy
turn
of
fate
am
i
to
attribute
your
dear
presence
here
with
a
crimsoned
face
she
looked
upon
him
and
said
faintly
you
not
expect
me
as
i
have
wished
for
you
i
could
not
he
said
our
last
interview
expect
the
happiness
of
seeing
you
sir
said
lotte
turning
with
a
face
as
white
as
death
to
nathan
gomer
could
not
have
conceived
the
misery
you
have
occasioned
me
or
you
would
never
have
placed
me
in
so
cruel
a
position
as
have
no
right
to
be
miserable
and
you
shall
not
be
miserable
if
i
have
any
influence
in
the
matter
replied
nathan
gomer
mark
did
not
expect
to
meet
you
here
because
he
was
not
consulted
in
the
lotte
turned
her
reproachful
eyes
upon
him
and
said
told
you
that
it
was
his
earnest
request
that
you
should
as
his
sister
was
very
ill
come
down
here
and
take
her
place
at
the
bedside
of
wilton
interrupted
nathan
speaking
in
rather
a
dogmatical
tone
he
did
request
you
in
his
heart
i
knew
that
and
made
use
of
it
the
fact
is
wilton
the
elder
is
a
very
obstinate
old
gentleman
a
career
of
privation
instead
of
teaching
him
some
useful
lessons
upon
social
relations
has
hardened
his
heart
as
prosperity
does
those
of
other
men
i
have
a
mind
to
teach
him
with
your
aid
miss
clinton
a
lesson
too
what
that
may
be
you
will
know
in
good
time
but
you
who
i
know
never
refused
to
do
good
to
all
within
your
reach
will
not
refuse
this
request
by
a
subterfuge
which
you
will
pardon
i
brought
you
here
by
appealing
to
your
unselfish
nature
i
hope
to
retain
you
here
mark
wilton
has
a
spirit
too
noble
to
take
advantage
of
your
presence
to
alter
the
respective
positions
in
which
you
stand
to
each
other
for
the
present
he
will
see
in
you
only
his
dear
friend
he
and
you
will
i
trust
leave
the
rest
to
me
under
my
guidance
i
hope
to
bring
present
cross
purposes
to
a
happy
unity
will
you
mark
be
so
good
as
to
lead
miss
clinton
to
your
room
she
is
fatigued
with
her
journey
and
then
be
kind
enough
to
return
to
me
for
though
dame
nature
omitted
to
lengthen
my
proportions
she
did
not
curtail
my
appetite
and
before
i
commence
other
operations
i
would
silence
its
mark
took
hand
his
impulse
was
to
press
it
but
he
refrained
he
led
her
from
the
room
and
on
his
way
he
said
presence
here
mi
mi
mi
hang
it
i
may
say
lotte
to
my
dear
friend
and
i
must
so
let
me
tell
you
lotte
your
coming
will
light
up
this
dull
gloomy
old
place
with
sunshine
it
is
indeed
welcome
to
me
and
you
will
find
how
dear
it
will
be
to
let
me
say
also
lotte
i
quite
understand
the
peculiarity
of
the
position
in
which
nathan
gomer
has
placed
you
but
i
am
sure
it
is
for
the
best
he
has
done
it
besides
you
know
he
can
do
just
what
he
pleases
here
let
me
further
beg
you
to
discard
all
fear
of
being
ill
at
ease
for
nothing
shall
be
left
untried
to
make
you
happy
and
contented
even
to
my
scrupulously
fulfilling
the
suggestion
of
nathan
he
released
her
hand
as
he
concluded
tapped
sharply
at
his
and
with
a
beaming
smile
of
happiness
such
as
had
not
for
some
time
illumined
his
face
he
quitted
her
and
hurrying
along
the
corridor
returned
to
nathan
gomer
in
one
statement
nathan
gomer
had
been
truthful
flora
wilton
was
really
very
ill
her
nerves
had
been
shattered
by
the
horrible
event
in
which
she
had
taken
part
and
by
the
sight
of
the
ghastly
face
of
her
father
as
he
lay
motionless
in
his
bed
on
her
return
to
harleydale
after
her
abduction
for
a
day
or
two
she
had
contrived
to
devote
herself
to
watching
and
waiting
upon
him
but
when
fever
and
delirium
the
effects
of
his
wound
exhibited
themselves
her
strength
gave
way
her
nervous
system
was
prostrated
and
the
physician
attending
her
father
insisted
upon
her
not
only
keeping
her
room
but
her
bed
to
prevent
fatal
consequences
following
her
efforts
to
continue
her
and
natural
office
of
nurse
the
chamber
door
was
opened
by
maid
who
without
a
word
admitted
lotte
assuming
her
to
be
a
friend
of
her
young
mistress
and
the
latter
walked
up
to
the
bedside
to
announce
herself
she
could
not
forget
in
doing
so
that
night
when
rescued
from
the
commission
of
a
great
crime
hal
vivian
presented
her
to
flora
she
was
not
likely
to
forget
her
reception
then
still
she
was
not
prepared
for
the
cry
of
delight
that
flora
uttered
when
her
feeble
eyes
rested
on
her
face
still
less
did
she
look
for
the
passionate
action
with
which
flora
flung
her
arms
about
her
neck
and
kissed
her
many
times
she
had
some
difficulty
in
preserving
her
composure
and
exerted
herself
to
calm
down
excitement
and
soothe
her
emotion
when
the
maid
intuitively
comprehending
that
her
absence
would
be
desirable
retired
lotte
sought
to
elicit
an
explanation
of
this
display
of
joy
at
her
appearance
the
more
striking
it
was
to
her
as
she
expected
only
to
be
welcomed
with
a
quiet
courtesy
tempered
by
the
reserve
which
did
not
acknowledge
an
equality
of
position
between
them
to
find
herself
so
pleasantly
in
error
was
agreeable
enough
but
she
needed
nevertheless
a
cause
for
conduct
at
least
improbable
and
which
in
the
circumstances
in
which
she
was
placed
she
could
hardly
help
looking
at
as
a
little
more
extravagant
than
the
occasion
warranted
grateful
so
very
grateful
as
she
was
for
it
she
had
yet
to
understand
actual
position
and
when
she
did
so
her
wonder
at
her
reception
was
considerably
modified
flora
had
not
one
friend
of
her
own
sex
when
old
wilton
came
to
harleydale
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
invite
to
his
new
home
the
gentry
of
the
vicinity
he
preferred
seclusion
flora
thus
had
not
even
a
female
acquaintance
the
events
by
which
she
had
been
rapidly
surrounded
were
all
of
a
character
to
render
communion
with
a
female
friend
all
but
imperative
one
in
whom
she
could
confide
with
whom
she
could
consult
became
in
her
isolation
a
want
necessary
to
her
present
happiness
with
each
succeeding
phase
of
circumstances
her
need
grew
greater
and
never
did
she
feel
more
keenly
than
at
the
moment
when
lotte
arrived
the
desolation
of
having
no
ear
in
which
to
pour
her
sorrows
no
gentle
eye
to
beam
with
sympathy
upon
her
sadness
no
tender
voice
to
guide
her
in
the
path
she
ought
to
take
of
all
the
world
lotte
clinton
was
the
being
she
would
have
selected
to
fill
up
the
void
of
all
faces
in
the
world
to
shine
upon
her
now
in
her
tribulation
lotte
was
the
most
welcome
she
knew
kindly
nature
and
she
knew
her
she
knew
that
she
loved
and
that
a
cloud
had
settled
on
that
love
she
had
faith
in
her
pure
bright
spirit
in
its
independence
in
her
clear
sense
of
rectitude
and
in
that
unwavering
resolve
which
would
maintain
her
in
acting
up
to
its
dictates
here
was
a
mind
to
direct
hers
a
soul
to
sympathise
with
her
and
a
breast
which
she
could
safely
make
the
repository
of
her
secrets
gradually
flora
revealed
the
want
under
which
she
had
so
long
suffered
and
was
not
long
in
putting
lotte
into
possession
of
the
fact
that
she
looked
upon
her
in
the
light
of
a
very
dear
dear
friend
lotte
knew
hal
vivian
ah
how
that
smoothed
the
path
to
many
a
revelation
and
she
listened
with
such
deep
attention
and
sympathy
to
confession
she
had
not
sought
it
that
in
the
fulness
of
her
heart
at
finding
at
last
a
comforter
and
a
counsellor
in
one
of
her
own
sex
and
of
her
own
age
of
her
own
cast
of
thought
and
feeling
flora
kept
back
nothing
and
ere
lotte
that
night
for
the
first
time
stood
in
the
sick
chamber
of
old
wilton
she
was
in
full
possession
of
all
that
flora
had
to
reveal
it
was
not
without
a
trembling
hesitation
a
nervous
sense
that
she
was
in
a
false
position
that
lotte
entered
chamber
but
she
felt
nevertheless
that
she
was
borne
along
by
the
stream
of
circumstances
and
she
could
not
resist
the
force
of
the
current
the
sight
of
the
invalid
however
his
moaning
ravings
and
feeble
motions
at
once
dissipated
all
her
personal
feelings
and
she
applied
herself
to
the
duties
she
had
undertaken
with
a
promptness
and
tact
which
showed
how
much
a
willing
spirit
can
supply
to
compensate
for
a
want
of
knowledge
thoughtfully
suggestive
tenderly
considerate
unwearied
in
application
to
her
task
she
elicited
the
warmest
encomiums
from
the
physician
who
at
the
end
of
the
week
told
her
in
the
presence
of
mark
and
nathan
gomer
that
wilton
if
his
life
was
spared
would
be
as
much
indebted
for
his
recovery
to
her
assiduous
care
and
faithful
performance
of
instructions
as
he
would
be
to
his
own
skill
mark
who
had
preserved
towards
her
a
very
quiet
and
respectful
demeanour
and
never
breathed
a
word
about
his
love
in
her
ear
regarded
her
now
with
grateful
and
affectionate
glances
while
nathan
gomer
with
shining
face
grinned
and
rubbed
his
hands
delightedly
so
for
a
short
time
matters
went
on
flora
who
shared
too
no
mean
portion
of
attention
fast
recovered
strength
and
felt
more
placid
and
calm
than
she
had
been
since
the
change
in
her
circumstances
had
taken
place
harry
vivian
was
not
at
harleydale
he
had
gone
to
the
scene
of
colonel
fatal
accident
to
attend
with
nathan
agent
a
inquest
he
had
previously
attended
a
preliminary
examination
of
chewkle
before
a
magistrate
on
which
occasion
the
extremely
chapfallen
criminal
was
remanded
for
the
recovery
of
wilton
who
it
was
stated
at
the
time
would
soon
be
sufficiently
well
to
give
evidence
but
wilton
at
first
grew
rapidly
worse
instead
of
better
and
therefore
chewkle
was
again
remanded
for
a
somewhat
longer
term
than
before
the
return
of
reason
found
him
terribly
enfeebled
but
the
danger
having
been
surmounted
the
recovery
of
strength
was
but
a
question
of
time
and
now
commenced
the
real
difficulty
lotte
had
to
encounter
wilton
as
soon
as
he
began
to
recognise
anything
noticed
presence
and
on
making
a
remark
respecting
it
was
informed
by
the
physician
that
it
was
a
young
lady
who
had
kindly
undertaken
to
tend
him
with
that
earnest
care
which
could
not
be
obtained
save
in
exceptional
instances
from
a
hired
nurse
and
he
spoke
in
warm
and
praiseful
terms
of
the
service
she
had
rendered
wilton
fancied
he
had
seen
her
face
somewhere
but
could
not
remember
where
it
was
a
passing
thought
and
he
did
not
ask
her
name
assuming
that
it
was
some
friend
of
residing
in
their
neighbourhood
in
truth
he
was
glad
to
think
so
and
satisfied
himself
with
the
supposition
for
he
felt
too
ill
to
pursue
inquiries
he
quickly
felt
the
value
of
presence
and
her
services
there
were
so
many
little
nameless
attentions
such
a
close
regard
for
his
comfort
and
immunity
from
pain
such
a
constant
anticipation
of
his
wishes
and
his
wants
that
at
length
he
could
scarcely
bear
her
from
his
sight
he
began
to
get
strength
to
talk
and
he
conversed
with
her
or
listened
while
she
read
to
him
eliciting
occasionally
her
opinions
upon
the
subject
he
had
selected
and
he
was
pleased
with
the
evidence
she
gave
of
a
sensible
and
practical
mind
as
well
as
of
a
pure
taste
soon
his
conversation
chatty
and
familiar
began
to
revert
to
herself
and
became
embarrassingly
personal
still
he
did
not
identify
her
he
knew
indeed
that
her
name
was
clinton
but
the
name
itself
struck
him
no
more
than
if
it
had
been
brown
or
thompson
at
least
in
connection
with
the
individual
whom
his
son
frantically
as
he
considered
designed
to
marry
in
fact
it
was
not
likely
to
occur
to
him
that
a
young
damsel
against
whose
admission
into
his
family
he
had
so
vehemently
and
determinedly
set
his
face
should
have
absolutely
taken
possession
of
his
sick
chamber
to
act
a
part
and
as
he
had
adopted
as
soon
as
he
began
to
be
sensible
of
her
kind
attention
the
appellation
of
little
nurse
in
addressing
or
speaking
of
her
the
name
of
clinton
quickly
left
his
memory
only
from
her
hand
would
he
take
his
medicine
she
never
made
any
mistake
or
gave
him
more
or
less
than
he
ought
to
have
had
and
if
she
was
not
there
to
administer
it
he
insisted
that
it
was
not
the
proper
time
to
take
it
she
gave
him
his
food
it
was
always
correct
as
to
its
quality
quantity
and
fitness
hers
was
the
first
face
to
greet
his
opening
eyes
in
the
morning
the
last
upon
whom
they
closed
at
night
ay
even
in
the
night
at
times
he
would
wake
and
find
the
same
pleasant
patient
face
hanging
over
him
and
when
he
asked
why
she
had
not
retired
she
was
always
ready
to
answer
him
with
a
plea
that
during
the
previous
day
she
had
observed
him
to
be
not
so
well
and
as
a
restless
night
usually
followed
those
symptoms
of
retrogression
she
was
merely
at
hand
to
administer
to
him
some
soothing
medicine
which
the
physician
had
provided
for
such
contingencies
her
hand
alone
could
smooth
and
arrange
his
pillow
to
his
satisfaction
she
was
never
impatient
under
the
caprices
of
his
temper
or
his
whims
she
moved
always
with
such
alacrity
so
light
of
foot
when
requested
to
do
anything
for
him
she
submitted
so
gently
and
patiently
to
his
querulous
testiness
and
bore
his
peevish
remarks
as
she
had
throughout
executed
the
task
allotted
to
her
without
a
cloud
upon
her
brow
or
a
ruffle
on
her
equanimity
course
cry
the
selfish
shrugging
their
shoulders
conduct
was
eminently
politic
she
had
a
deep
game
to
play
and
had
the
shrewdness
as
well
as
the
ability
to
understand
the
part
assigned
to
her
and
to
perform
it
but
people
are
not
always
correct
in
their
assumptions
and
in
jumping
to
a
conclusion
sometimes
arrive
only
at
the
mire
of
their
own
ungenerous
instincts
being
as
far
from
the
truth
as
they
are
from
the
possession
of
tenderness
of
heart
or
magnanimity
of
soul
the
policy
of
such
conduct
formed
no
element
in
demeanour
or
action
it
was
in
fact
the
result
of
her
organisation
having
undertaken
such
a
duty
to
so
fulfil
it
wilton
now
rapidly
approaching
a
state
of
convalescence
began
to
weary
of
his
chamber
and
to
long
to
inhale
the
fresh
air
without
his
stately
dwelling
he
sketched
out
to
lotte
walks
upon
the
terrace
and
of
the
pleasure
he
should
enjoy
in
again
being
enabled
to
take
them
and
how
much
that
pleasure
would
be
enhanced
by
her
favouring
him
with
the
support
of
her
kind
arm
he
promised
to
enlighten
her
upon
many
subjects
of
science
and
art
of
which
she
knew
nothing
and
he
promised
himself
also
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
her
simple
but
always
pertinent
and
sensible
remarks
flora
too
had
recovered
her
strength
and
her
spirits
communion
with
lotte
had
toned
down
the
perturbation
of
her
mind
and
rendered
her
far
more
contented
and
hopeful
than
she
had
been
for
some
time
past
poor
lotte
her
own
exhibited
no
sign
the
acute
agony
of
her
own
thoughts
was
never
suffered
to
display
any
influence
upon
her
actions
or
manner
in
the
presence
of
others
it
was
only
when
alone
and
offering
up
her
prayers
to
heaven
for
strength
to
sustain
her
in
the
performance
of
her
duty
to
others
no
less
than
to
herself
that
the
convulsions
of
a
poignant
sorrow
bore
down
all
opposition
and
prostrated
her
poor
lotte
if
she
had
entertained
any
misgivings
even
during
most
sanguine
representations
to
her
of
becoming
his
wife
they
resolved
themselves
into
a
certainty
now
she
had
only
to
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
picturesque
antique
hall
with
its
saloons
and
its
galleries
its
rich
appointments
its
paintings
and
its
sculptures
upon
the
with
its
fountains
its
flowers
its
rare
shrubs
its
elegant
exotics
and
trees
and
smoothly
gravelled
serpentine
paths
upon
the
park
with
its
slopes
and
undulations
of
green
sward
upon
the
plantation
and
the
woods
beyond
to
feel
that
it
was
not
for
her
so
humble
in
her
position
to
share
these
grand
and
beautiful
things
it
was
a
sorrowful
conviction
but
she
did
not
quarrel
now
with
opposition
to
her
becoming
wife
it
seemed
indeed
merely
natural
taking
life
as
she
had
found
it
that
he
should
do
so
and
not
unreasonable
and
it
was
to
bear
this
conviction
without
repining
that
she
prayed
earnestly
and
wrestled
with
her
wishes
ardently
flora
was
no
sooner
able
to
quit
her
room
than
she
applied
herself
to
the
task
of
relieving
lotte
of
some
portion
of
her
labours
she
did
this
with
affectionate
willingness
for
she
was
desirous
that
lotte
should
after
such
continuous
confinement
to
a
sick
chamber
be
enabled
to
obtain
rest
and
such
personal
enjoyment
as
the
beauties
and
advantages
of
the
place
afforded
and
by
the
time
wilton
was
prepared
to
make
his
first
visit
down
stairs
flora
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
resume
her
place
at
his
side
and
take
up
the
position
lotte
had
so
generously
and
so
well
filled
there
was
quite
a
little
excitement
when
wilton
came
down
for
the
first
time
since
his
attack
to
his
library
arm
was
used
by
him
for
support
because
lotte
had
not
made
her
appearance
the
old
man
was
disappointed
and
inquired
sharply
why
his
was
not
present
flora
replied
that
she
had
not
quitted
her
room
yet
that
she
was
unusually
late
this
morning
that
she
would
after
having
congratulated
him
upon
his
returning
to
his
old
place
in
the
house
hasten
to
her
chamber
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
her
sooner
the
better
said
wilton
drily
flora
quitted
the
room
and
mark
now
offered
his
father
his
congratulations
upon
his
having
quitted
his
invalid
chamber
and
his
reappearance
in
his
library
you
thank
you
responded
his
father
quickly
and
added
somewhat
peevishly
miss
the
congratulations
of
one
who
has
done
so
much
to
restore
me
to
my
place
here
i
quite
expected
to
have
had
her
help
to
get
here
or
at
least
her
pleasant
face
to
welcome
a
tender
good
girl
sir
said
mark
trying
to
curb
enthusiasm
of
tone
and
manner
an
angel
sir
cried
wilton
vehemently
repeat
it
an
angel
there
now
is
a
young
inestimable
creature
who
would
but
we
recur
to
that
now
another
time
well
well
where
is
little
nurse
he
cried
as
flora
entered
the
library
there
was
a
grave
expression
on
her
face
and
she
held
in
her
hand
a
letter
lotte
had
quitted
harleydale
early
that
morning
certainly
of
the
three
none
appeared
more
completely
thunderstruck
at
the
circumstance
than
wilton
he
cried
us
without
a
word
he
looked
fiercely
at
both
son
and
daughter
is
the
meaning
of
so
extraordinary
an
occurrence
he
continued
must
have
been
in
some
way
insulted
outraged
to
have
departed
in
so
abrupt
a
manner
whoever
has
dared
to
be
guilty
of
aught
which
can
have
compelled
her
to
act
thus
shall
be
visited
by
my
most
wrathful
the
old
man
spoke
with
great
excitement
flora
at
his
manner
said
hurriedly
is
a
letter
father
which
she
has
left
upon
her
addressed
to
it
cried
wilton
imperatively
flora
opened
the
note
and
with
genuine
emotion
read
the
contents
they
ran
thus
dear
miss
wilton
not
think
harshly
of
me
for
quitting
you
and
your
beautiful
home
thus
abruptly
but
indeed
i
could
not
summon
fortitude
enough
to
part
with
you
for
ever
ejaculated
mark
and
his
father
in
a
breath
quivering
flora
repeated
the
word
and
went
on
reading
mission
is
fulfilled
i
was
placed
by
your
bedside
in
the
darkest
hour
of
his
danger
with
no
skill
but
only
a
hopeful
heart
and
willing
spirit
to
help
and
guide
me
it
has
pleased
heaven
to
place
him
on
the
threshold
of
health
and
my
services
with
you
by
his
side
are
no
longer
needed
so
i
retire
again
into
my
own
humble
i
allow
her
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
roared
old
wilton
excitedly
sir
for
mercy
sake
hush
cried
mark
and
in
an
agitated
manner
said
to
flora
go
flora
brushed
her
tears
away
and
proceeded
reading
have
imagined
and
feel
rewarded
by
the
thanks
your
generous
heart
and
kind
nature
would
prompt
you
to
render
me
for
what
i
have
endeavoured
to
accomplish
in
my
office
of
nurse
i
have
imagined
those
of
the
other
members
of
your
family
and
so
am
amply
repaid
you
and
they
owe
me
nothing
on
that
account
yet
if
i
might
claim
a
favour
quite
to
repay
all
obligation
it
would
be
to
ask
of
you
all
to
forget
me
or
if
you
may
not
be
able
to
remove
all
traces
of
her
whose
social
grade
renders
her
of
little
worth
in
the
eyes
of
those
in
your
position
from
lingering
in
your
memory
at
least
act
as
if
i
were
no
more
remembered
do
not
seek
me
do
not
write
to
me
wilton
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
wonder
flora
with
an
unsteady
voice
proceeded
beg
also
to
be
spared
from
giving
explanations
for
what
must
seem
strange
conduct
in
the
eyes
of
your
parent
yourself
perhaps
of
others
but
i
trust
you
will
rest
content
by
the
acknowledgment
that
i
am
weaker
in
spirit
than
i
believed
myself
to
le
that
seeing
hopes
shown
to
be
illusions
and
dreams
dissipated
by
hard
perhaps
cold
facts
i
am
desirous
of
not
having
anything
in
future
presented
to
my
eyes
to
raise
up
recollections
of
my
poor
folly
but
would
pray
to
be
permitted
to
pass
my
future
life
with
resignation
and
in
graceful
obscurity
you
may
know
all
or
you
may
know
nothing
in
either
case
i
earnestly
implore
you
to
grant
my
request
and
so
dear
dear
miss
wilton
unequal
to
the
agony
of
parting
with
you
personally
take
now
from
me
therefore
through
the
medium
of
this
note
my
farewell
and
for
ever
may
the
almighty
bless
you
and
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
coughed
a
voice
loudly
preventing
by
the
interruption
flora
from
adding
the
name
appended
to
the
note
old
wilton
whose
eyes
were
riveted
on
flora
turned
sharply
to
the
spot
whence
the
sound
proceeded
as
did
mark
and
flora
they
beheld
nathan
gomer
standing
before
them
he
blew
his
nose
almost
fiercely
and
we
are
not
sure
that
his
eyelids
were
not
filled
with
water
he
cleared
his
voice
which
betrayed
symptoms
of
huskiness
and
muttering
first
something
about
plaguy
cold
he
addressed
flora
am
sorry
miss
wilton
he
said
interrupt
you
or
to
intrude
unannounced
upon
private
family
matters
but
i
have
some
very
important
business
which
can
not
be
delayed
to
transact
with
your
good
father
whom
i
congratulate
upon
being
down
here
in
his
library
once
more
with
the
permission
of
yourself
and
your
brother
i
will
proceed
to
my
work
at
both
flora
and
mark
were
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
retiring
from
the
library
to
confer
together
upon
remarkable
proceeding
flora
was
utterly
overwhelmed
with
surprise
at
what
had
happened
mark
was
not
he
began
to
understand
character
better
never
did
he
honour
her
more
highly
or
love
her
more
dearly
than
when
he
heard
the
contents
of
that
letter
which
he
not
only
intended
to
read
but
having
obtained
possession
of
to
keep
when
mark
and
flora
had
departed
old
wilton
motioned
to
nathan
gomer
to
be
seated
all
the
time
in
a
state
of
mystification
and
wonder
at
the
behaviour
of
his
pretty
kind
little
nurse
there
was
something
to
unravel
he
was
sure
of
that
and
after
all
who
really
was
she
and
why
had
she
departed
from
his
house
in
a
manner
so
extraordinary
say
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
now
exclaimed
nathan
gomer
loudly
repeating
some
words
he
had
previously
uttered
he
had
been
talking
for
some
little
time
and
wilton
had
not
heard
a
word
the
old
man
started
and
apologised
for
his
inattention
singular
circumstance
has
occurred
beneath
my
roof
he
said
it
has
surprised
mystified
and
upset
me
yes
much
disturbed
me
when
i
hoped
to
have
been
really
more
gratified
and
happy
than
i
have
been
for
a
long
time
when
you
have
finished
your
communication
i
will
take
your
opinion
upon
the
nathan
gomer
peered
under
his
eyebrows
at
him
and
stroked
his
chin
he
noted
with
seeming
pleasure
the
vexed
expression
the
old
features
wore
but
he
made
no
allusion
to
it
nor
even
to
the
incident
respecting
which
he
was
to
be
called
upon
to
give
his
opinion
he
said
in
a
dry
manner
stated
to
you
the
present
position
of
grahame
and
i
have
come
to
consult
with
you
upon
our
future
course
with
respect
to
that
unhappy
man
and
his
family
i
did
not
hear
you
gomer
exclaimed
wilton
quickly
repeat
it
how
stands
now
the
proud
man
who
would
have
destroyed
me
and
mine
indeed
broken
beggared
and
outcast
returned
nathan
with
emphasis
a
grim
smile
sat
on
features
he
muttered
heavy
one
eustace
wilton
said
nathan
with
a
sharpness
in
his
tone
not
usual
with
him
has
been
struck
to
the
heart
in
his
family
as
well
as
in
his
fortune
i
have
small
pity
for
the
man
for
he
paused
not
at
the
most
foul
crimes
to
accomplish
his
selfish
ends
but
i
can
not
look
at
the
stain
which
has
befallen
the
female
members
of
the
family
without
a
feeling
of
pain
and
regret
they
were
at
least
innocent
of
harm
to
you
in
thought
or
children
were
innocent
of
wrong
to
grahame
said
wilton
harshly
he
spared
them
are
not
a
grahame
cried
gomer
in
a
startling
voice
do
not
take
his
infamous
conduct
as
your
standard
of
action
do
you
wilton
shrank
back
and
felt
the
colour
spring
into
his
cheeks
as
he
beheld
the
glittering
eyes
of
the
little
man
fixed
upon
his
features
as
if
to
read
by
their
expression
what
was
passing
in
his
heart
with
an
effort
he
assumed
a
cold
demeanour
and
said
me
what
is
the
exact
position
of
the
family
at
the
present
moment
have
done
so
said
gomer
with
a
manner
as
cold
as
his
own
will
repeat
it
grahame
has
fled
it
is
not
known
whither
although
a
hot
search
has
been
made
for
him
the
sheriff
is
in
possession
of
his
house
in
london
at
my
suit
his
eldest
daughter
fled
from
his
house
and
became
a
mother
before
she
knew
she
was
a
wife
his
second
daughter
has
eloped
with
the
duke
of
allborne
and
is
now
his
kept
mistress
the
proud
mother
the
destroyer
of
her
husband
and
so
far
as
she
could
be
the
cause
of
her
ruin
confined
to
her
bed
with
a
wasting
illness
and
a
crushed
brain
she
is
a
hopeless
idiot
the
son
is
in
prison
arrested
at
the
suit
of
a
tailor
who
has
been
discounting
bills
for
him
which
he
has
dishonoured
that
is
the
condition
of
the
proud
grahames
i
ask
you
are
you
satisfied
are
your
feelings
of
revenge
glutted
by
this
wholesale
wreck
of
the
family
there
was
i
think
another
daughter
said
wilton
in
a
low
hesitating
tone
do
not
mention
nathan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
tartly
mean
the
youngest
evangeline
a
simple
artless
innocent
girl
with
a
foolishly
affectionate
nature
she
is
pretty
and
engaging
and
has
been
giving
clandestine
meetings
to
a
young
clerk
if
he
happens
to
be
a
scoundrel
it
is
not
difficult
to
prophecy
what
will
be
her
fate
again
i
ask
you
are
you
satisfied
old
wilton
rose
up
he
pressed
his
clenched
fist
upon
his
heart
in
a
hoarse
voice
he
exclaimed
am
shocked
i
am
horrified
gomer
i
contemplated
this
situation
with
a
vile
satisfaction
i
am
terrified
at
its
realization
my
vengeance
ugh
it
is
gorged
we
must
interpose
stay
the
further
progress
of
their
misery
we
will
save
this
child
this
evangeline
and
rescue
too
the
rest
from
destitution
and
perdition
oh
pride
accursed
pride
it
has
triumphed
over
the
reason
and
the
conscience
of
both
grahame
and
his
wife
had
they
listened
to
the
gentle
pleadings
of
nature
rather
than
to
the
dictates
of
an
overweening
selfish
unfeeling
arrogant
pride
home
and
at
this
moment
have
been
to
them
a
source
of
the
purest
domestic
felicity
what
is
it
now
i
shudder
to
reflect
upon
it
the
happiness
of
their
children
could
never
have
been
an
element
in
their
worldly
calculations
on
the
contrary
they
have
trampled
on
the
natural
affections
and
have
considered
their
offspring
rather
as
appendages
to
their
state
than
as
children
part
and
parcel
of
themselves
oh
it
is
terrible
it
is
terrible
ho
shouted
nathan
gomer
and
springing
up
he
caught
wilton
by
the
wrist
saying
with
vehement
earnestness
all
things
truth
and
truth
at
all
times
why
pride
does
this
for
pride
makes
determine
to
trample
on
the
natural
affections
you
you
would
break
your
heart
rather
than
she
should
not
give
her
hand
to
a
most
dishonourable
honourable
you
would
at
the
inspiration

the
night
of
the
great
and
last
party
at
mansion
in
the
park
was
in
the
anticipation
of
grahame
to
have
proved
a
crowning
triumph
of
calculation
upon
this
night
she
expected
the
duke
of
allborne
to
propose
to
her
daughter
margaret
he
did
propose
and
his
offer
was
accepted
but
not
in
accordance
with
plan
this
night
of
splendid
triumph
as
it
was
to
have
been
proved
to
her
a
night
of
horror
the
presence
of
lester
vane
threw
her
into
a
state
of
nervous
apprehension
and
agitation
for
fear
that
he
would
disclose
the
conduct
and
disappearance
of
her
daughter
helen
she
observed
however
with
as
much
gratification
as
she
could
feel
in
such
a
condition
of
flurry
and
alarm
that
the
duke
maintained
a
position
close
to
margaret
during
the
early
part
of
the
evening
and
devoted
himself
to
her
she
saw
them
retire
into
the
garden
and
she
believed
her
hopes
would
be
fulfilled
she
had
no
conception
of
what
was
about
to
happen
the
music
played
joyously
the
dancers
whirled
around
in
festive
enjoyment
and
the
absence
of
lester
vane
for
a
time
gave
to
perturbed
mind
great
relief
but
lester
vane
again
returned
and
in
spite
of
her
manouvres
he
contrived
to
elude
the
proximity
to
him
which
she
strove
to
keep
up
she
was
however
once
more
soothed
by
seeing
him
depart
shortly
however
after
he
had
gone
she
noticed
a
decided
movement
in
her
guests
one
by
one
they
disappeared
and
rapidly
too
in
corners
of
the
handsome
saloon
groups
gathered
and
stood
whispering
until
she
approached
them
then
they
separated
and
coolly
bowed
to
her
as
they
passed
but
they
unmistakeably
at
the
same
time
left
the
house
evangeline
approached
her
and
whispered
to
her
has
happened
to
margaret
mamma
and
why
do
some
of
these
haughty
people
speak
in
terms
of
contempt
of
her
a
flash
of
lightning
seemed
to
dart
through
brain
the
blood
rushed
back
to
her
heart
her
eyes
seemed
filled
with
blood
she
gazed
with
hazy
vision
round
the
room
to
do
so
was
a
tremendous
effort
but
though
it
had
slain
her
she
must
have
done
it
margaret
was
not
present
nor
the
duke
of
allborne
they
must
have
been
absent
hours
your
papa
to
me
eva
exclaimed
grahame
in
a
broken
guttural
voice
has
not
been
in
the
room
for
a
long
time
she
replied
quitted
before
margaret
went
into
the
garden
with
the
servants
into
the
garden
and
bid
your
sister
return
instantly
hither
let
her
know
her
absence
has
occasioned
grahame
staggered
to
a
seat
as
she
spoke
and
evangeline
quitted
the
saloon
to
obey
her
the
unhappy
woman
sat
alone
sick
dizzy
agonised
after
all
a
volcano
existed
beneath
the
surface
of
ice
no
one
came
and
sat
down
by
her
her
guests
appeared
to
shun
her
she
heard
one
heartless
woman
exclaim
cold
night
for
a
journey
even
with
love
to
warm
she
heard
a
man
say
dislike
the
spirit
which
made
her
go
off
with
such
and
another
utter
a
taunt
in
reference
to
the
boldness
of
allborne
she
had
a
dim
comprehension
of
what
it
all
meant
but
was
powerless
to
act
she
was
transfixed
by
a
whirl
of
thoughts
horrifying
thoughts
she
lost
consciousness
of
what
was
going
on
about
her
she
seemed
to
be
burdened
by
a
frightful
nightmare
which
while
it
presented
the
most
horrible
visions
to
her
distracted
eyes
refused
her
the
power
to
move
a
limb
she
appeared
frozen
to
her
seat
she
was
at
length
restored
to
the
no
less
horrible
reality
by
evangeline
who
rousing
her
by
her
tearful
embrace
pointed
out
to
her
the
fact
that
every
guest
was
gone
that
the
most
active
search
had
failed
to
discover
margaret
and
that
grahame
was
not
in
the
house
though
no
one
had
seen
him
leave
it
grahame
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
was
borne
to
her
bed
insensible
the
next
day
she
was
a
raving
maniac
and
subsequently
the
most
terrible
delirium
gave
place
to
a
babbling
idiocy
still
nothing
was
heard
of
grahame
nor
margaret
nor
helen
evangeline
alone
had
the
trial
to
endure
she
had
the
aid
of
a
physician
and
that
of
truebody
the
nurse
to
her
mother
that
was
all
her
father
did
not
return
a
week
elapsed
still
he
came
not
nor
came
there
any
communication
from
him
a
few
days
more
and
jukes
made
his
appearance
as
representative
of
the
sheriff
of
middlesex
grahame
had
put
in
no
appearance
to
the
writs
with
which
he
had
been
served
judgment
went
by
default
and
execution
was
obtained
mr
jukes
levied
and
placed
both
nutty
and
sudds
in
possession
evangeline
did
not
understand
what
it
meant
and
in
her
distress
she
thought
of
charles
clinton
she
wrote
to
him
and
made
an
assignation
with
him
for
she
feared
she
knew
not
wherefore
to
ask
him
to
come
to
the
house
the
appointment
was
kept
and
she
told
him
all
she
implored
him
to
advise
her
how
to
act
and
to
explain
to
her
how
it
was
that
strange
dirty
men
could
force
themselves
into
the
house
stay
there
and
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
call
in
policemen
and
have
them
turned
out
he
made
all
clear
to
her
assigned
the
reason
of
the
flight
of
her
father
to
his
fear
of
arrest
for
debt
or
want
of
moral
courage
to
face
the
disgrace
of
his
fall
being
proclaimed
to
the
world
he
explained
to
her
that
in
a
few
days
the
whole
contents
of
the
mansion
would
be
sold
and
that
she
and
her
mother
would
be
turned
homeless
and
penniless
into
the
street
he
counselled
her
to
write
to
the
wealthiest
of
her
near
relatives
lay
bare
all
the
facts
and
ask
them
to
come
forward
to
assist
her
in
her
cruel
and
unhappy
condition
he
undertook
to
manage
to
delay
the
return
of
the
writ
of
execution
until
she
could
get
an
answer
and
with
soothing
words
and
sanguine
prophecies
with
earnest
entreaties
to
keep
a
good
heart
he
accompanied
her
to
her
home
and
parted
with
her
under
a
promise
to
meet
again
as
soon
as
her
application
to
her
scotch
relations
was
answered
in
three
days
she
received
it
there
was
no
delay
in
the
reply
the
and
selfish
who
spontaneously
refuse
to
help
those
in
distress
are
usually
prompt
in
announcing
their
purpose
evangeline
received
a
reply
expressing
great
surprise
and
indignation
at
what
had
happened
and
under
the
circumstances
at
the
application
if
grahame
had
not
thought
fit
to
provide
for
his
children
in
his
prosperity
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
his
relations
would
do
so
in
their
distress
the
writer
lamented
the
events
but
hoped
it
would
terminate
less
unfavourably
than
she
had
expected
she
wept
bitterly
when
she
read
the
note
it
almost
broke
her
heart
she
was
frightened
to
distraction
at
the
prospect
before
her
what
could
she
do
not
alone
for
herself
but
for
her
most
miserable
parent
she
met
charley
again
she
could
not
speak
to
him
but
sank
upon
his
breast
and
wept
she
seemed
to
him
as
a
bird
nestling
in
his
bosom
surely
he
thought
there
is
no
worldly
distinction
between
us
now
and
he
would
upon
the
impulse
have
pressed
her
to
his
heart
no
she
was
still
as
much
his
superior
by
birth
and
therefore
by
station
as
she
had
ever
been
her
affliction
instead
of
levelling
her
he
perceived
ought
to
elevate
her
in
his
respect
now
least
of
all
was
a
time
for
him
to
break
through
the
barrier
which
conventional
usages
placed
between
them
and
he
bowed
to
the
dictates
of
his
honour
no
less
than
his
conscience
and
his
manner
to
her
became
more
deferential
and
respectful
than
ever
he
listened
when
she
could
speak
to
her
sorrowful
communication
silently
and
he
read
the
letter
she
handed
to
him
with
a
bitter
smile
of
contempt
then
he
said
to
her
at
least
have
better
news
for
you
i
have
communicated
with
the
plaintiff
in
the
suit
against
your
father
i
have
stated
to
him
the
very
very
painful
position
in
which
you
are
placed
and
i
urged
upon
him
to
delay
for
a
short
time
the
last
proceedings
in
this
unhappy
affair
in
a
kind
and
feeling
letter
i
have
his
instructions
to
keep
everything
as
it
is
until
further
notice
i
am
not
to
permit
a
single
article
in
the
household
to
be
touched
i
am
to
remove
one
of
the
men
and
the
one
remaining
is
to
be
placed
where
he
will
not
be
seen
and
i
am
further
directed
personally
to
see
that
the
terrible
condition
of
grahame
is
not
injured
by
anything
that
may
hereafter
evangeline
pressed
his
hand
warmly
intelligence
is
welcome
indeed
she
said
with
emotion
feared
that
we
should
be
cast
upon
the
wide
world
to
perish
with
no
pitying
soul
to
hold
forth
a
hand
to
save
one
i
hope
one
said
charley
gently
she
asked
in
simple
surprise
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
he
replied
in
a
low
tone
which
gradually
grew
earnest
could
not
have
seen
you
placed
in
so
distressful
a
position
without
proffering
my
humble
aid
i
would
have
done
my
best
to
have
secured
you
from
the
worst
pangs
of
friendless
privation
my
dear
dear
sister
lotte
would
have
welcomed
you
and
shared
her
home
with
you
it
would
have
been
a
long
remove
from
the
splendour
of
your
own
but
in
the
sincerity
of
heart
and
the
earnestness
of
desire
to
make
you
happy
to
have
been
found
within
its
walls
it
would
at
least
have
equalled
evangeline
again
pressed
his
hand
but
her
heart
was
too
full
to
speak
shall
see
you
at
your
own
abode
morning
miss
grahame
he
said
be
assured
so
far
as
lies
in
my
power
every
effort
to
remove
all
trace
of
the
presence
of
the
individuals
whose
office
is
so
offensive
shall
be
made
so
that
however
unhappy
the
circumstances
may
be
which
still
surround
you
that
annoyance
shall
be
withdrawn
from
can
never
forget
your
kindness
clinton
murmured
evangeline
can
not
hope
to
repay
it
but
by
offering
up
my
prayers
for
your
welfare
and
your
as
the
last
word
escaped
her
lips
evangeline
was
struck
by
the
thought
that
the
task
of
administering
to
that
happiness
would
be
delightful
to
the
happy
happy
woman
to
whom
it
would
be
entrusted
she
sighed
oh
that
it
might
be
her
lot
but
no
the
frowns
of
fortune
were
upon
their
house
and
she
had
but
to
look
forward
to
a
life
of
secret
sorrow
passed
in
tending
her
mother
through
all
the
miserable
phases
of
her
terrible
affliction
which
the
most
eminent
physicians
had
pronounced
incurable
she
sighed
again
and
cast
her
sweet
eyes
upon
charley
ah
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
misunderstand
the
soft
dreamy
expression
of
that
gaze
but
it
was
equally
impossible
for
him
to
forget
or
abuse
the
confiding
trustfulness
she
had
reposed
in
him
therefore
he
preserved
towards
her
still
the
same
respectful
gentle
deference
he
had
shown
hitherto
there
might
perhaps
he
thought
come
a
time
when
he
could
speak
to
her
without
impropriety
the
true
language
of
his
heart
could
address
her
in
the
fervent
terms
which
his
deep
devotion
for
her
would
be
sure
to
suggest
but
until
that
time
she
was
to
him
a
young
and
gentle
lady
in
affliction
who
in
full
confidence
in
his
honour
had
applied
to
him
for
counsel
and
direction
and
he
revered
his
honour
too
religiously
to
evade
its
stern
dictates
at
the
promptings
of
a
passionate
love
even
though
there
was
the
temptation
of
a
sweet
yielding
loving
nature
which
saw
not
the
wide
gap
in
their
social
grade
with
the
same
eyes
as
he
did
to
aid
those
promptings
no
he
curbed
his
strong
inclinings
and
contented
himself
a
melancholy
content
it
was
with
the
reflection
that
if
events
favoured
his
wishes
he
should
propose
to
her
and
wed
her
in
honour
fairly
anticipating
the
felicity
which
would
possibly
attend
such
an
union
if
however
fate
decided
against
him
he
would
devote
himself
only
still
closer
to
the
abstruse
study
of
the
law
strive
to
make
a
happy
lady
of
lotte
and
die
a
bachelor
for
marry
another
than
evangeline
he
resolved
never
to
do
conducting
evangeline
like
a
chevalier
attending
a
dame
to
her
castle
home
he
left
her
within
sight
of
it
so
that
he
might
know
she
regained
it
unmolested
then
he
turned
slowly
away
to
go
home
and
dream
all
kinds
of
lovely
things
about
her
every
day
after
this
he
visited
the
abode
of
evangeline
to
carry
out
the
instructions
of
nathan
gomer
during
one
of
these
visits
while
seated
talking
to
evangeline
who
was
looking
tenderly
into
his
clear
dark
eyes
and
listening
in
deep
attention
to
the
words
which
fell
from
his
lips
not
that
they
were
of
themselves
of
much
interest
but
there
was
a
tone
in
the
voice
which
uttered
them
that
had
a
music
in
her
ear
far
surpassing
that
ever
given
by
instrument
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
the
rustling
of
silk
was
heard
both
looked
up
and
evangeline
with
a
cry
of
passionate
joy
leaped
from
her
seat
and
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
a
lady
who
stood
upon
the
threshold
dearest
helen
she
cried
with
intense
emotion
helen
such
affliction
such
trouble
has
befallen
she
hid
her
face
sobbing
upon
her
shoulder
charley
glided
at
once
out
of
the
room
and
the
two
sisters
after
the
first
burst
of
emotion
was
over
sat
down
and
then
evangeline
related
interrupted
only
with
hysteric
sobs
all
that
had
happened
dwelling
upon
the
mysterious
absence
of
her
father
of
whom
not
a
single
trace
had
been
discovered
though
every
effort
had
been
made
and
upon
the
pitiable
condition
to
which
their
mother
had
been
reduced
helen
in
the
midst
of
their
talk
rose
up
and
said
with
a
strong
inspiration
of
her
breath
i
will
see
my
mother
now
lead
me
to
evangeline
took
her
hand
and
together
they
entered
the
darkened
chamber
where
the
wreck
of
the
proud
woman
lay
in
hopeless
imbecility
helen
grew
pale
as
ashes
as
she
entered
the
room
her
heart
throbbed
painfully
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
old
truebody
and
as
the
good
old
creature
started
and
wrung
her
hands
she
felt
her
breath
come
and
go
in
short
hysteric
gasps
with
a
strong
effort
she
drew
the
curtain
aside
and
beheld
the
white
pinched
and
drawn
features
of
her
mother
screwed
up
into
a
smile
such
a
smile
anything
more
terribly
vacant
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
her
eyes
divested
of
all
expression
roamed
to
and
fro
without
any
apparent
object
she
gibbered
and
babbled
and
clutched
at
the
bedclothes
with
her
fingers
sometimes
she
nodded
her
head
and
then
a
short
screeching
laugh
would
be
heard
helen
with
a
burst
of
anguish
fell
upon
her
knees
and
said
in
accents

but

in
the
name
of
holy
charity
speak
to
me
grahame
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
turned
her
head
but
she
only
laughed
vacantly
and
nodded
and
screeched
again
helen
wept
frantically
she
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
wildly
she
bent
over
her
and
caressed
her
in
the
throes
of
the
deepest
emotion
but
without
eliciting
one
single
token
of
recognition
truebody
at
length
came
forward
and
took
helen
by
the
arm
and
waist
pray
you
to
retire
my
dear
young
lady
she
said
speaking
with
firmness
are
unintentionally
only
doing
ill
your
unhappy
mother
is
beyond
all
power
of
recognition
there
is
only
one
hope
of
a
restoration
of
her
senses
and
that
will
be
immediately
preceding
the
moment
when
heaven
pleases
to
call
her
hence
now
you
are
disturbing
and
making
her
feverish
because
she
can
not
understand
your
actions
or
comprehend
your
grief
you
are
injuring
your
own
health
when
its
preservation
is
needful
and
you
are
afflicting
your
dear
young
sister
beyond
her
power
to
endure
it
pray
pray
exert
your
i
do
assure
you
mi
madam
that
your
best
fortitude
and
courage
are
needed
with
one
agonised
look
at
the
expressionless
face
of
her
mother
helen
turned
to
depart
she
caught
evangeline
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
cheeks
with
fervent
earnestness
and
then
with
her
arm
folded
around
her
waist
she
quitted
the
chamber
not
a
word
or
look
at
truebody
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
say
a
word
to
her
now
she
had
not
forgotten
her
she
had
prepared
a
suitable
reward
for
her
but
at
this
moment
the
sight
of
her
face
raised
too
many
unhappy
recollections
for
her
to
be
able
even
to
speak
to
her
once
more
alone
in
the
sitting
room
helen
inquired
of
evangeline
where
her
sister
margaret
was
and
upon
what
plea
she
had
quitted
the
scene
of
affliction
evangeline
simply
recounted
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
mysterious
elopement
with
the
duke
of
allborne
and
expressed
her
wonder
that
margaret
should
not
have
stopped
at
home
and
been
married
in
the
proper
and
usual
fashion
helen
with
burning
cheeks
and
suffocating
emotion
rose
up
and
paced
the
room
placing
her
hands
upon
her
beating
temples
suddenly
she
turned
round
and
said
was
malcolm
that
he
did
not
follow
them
told
me
that
the
honorable
vane
advised
him
not
to
do
so
he
said
that
it
was
a
mere
romantic
flight
to
gretna
green
and
that
it
would
all
come
right
at
atrocious
villain
muttered
helen
and
then
said
sharply
where
is
malcolm
now
why
should
he
my
poor
evangeline
have
deserted
you
in
this
dreadful
crisis
is
in
prison
returned
evangeline
with
a
shudder
i
i
mean
it
was
explained
to
me
that
he
had
incurred
debts
and
did
not
pay
them
and
therefore
the
creditor
by
help
of
the
law
put
him
into
prison
until
he
can
make
some
helen
clasped
her
hands
is
an
abject
fall
for
pride
indeed
she
exclaimed
with
bitterness
as
her
eye
fell
upon
sweet
artless
face
in
gratitude
that
at
least
she
had
escaped
the
heavy
visitations
which
had
fallen
on
the
other
members
of
her
family
she
observed
that
her
skin
so
rarely
delicate
and
white
in
its
accustomed
aspect
was
suffused
with
crimson
and
that
she
seemed
strangely
confused
was
explained
to
me
suddenly
recurred
to
helen
as
a
sentence
evangeline
had
uttered
with
some
embarrassment
then
it
flashed
through
her
mind
that
she
had
found
her
with
a
young
and
handsome
man
whose
face
she
did
not
at
the
moment
recognise
like
as
he
was
in
his
general
contour
to
lotte
clinton
a
pang
went
to
her
heart
what
was
not
even
her
simple
innocent
sister
to
be
saved
she
sat
her
down
and
questioned
eva
closely
she
elicited
from
her
a
confession
of
all
the
clandestine
meetings
she
had
granted
to
charles
clinton
with
the
purpose
of
learning
tidings
of
her
sister
or
of
obtaining
guidance
and
counsel
under
the
great
affliction
with
which
the
whole
household
was
overwhelmed
helen
wiped
the
clammy
moisture
from
her
brow
and
moistened
her
parched
lips
she
fixed
her
gaze
upon
still
crimsoned
features
and
her
downcast
eyes
and
then
placing
her
cold
hand
upon
her
and
clutching
it
firmly
she
said
you
love
this
man
a
thousand
thousand
thoughts
rushed
through
mind
love
him
in
truth
she
did
with
her
whole
heart
her
whole
soul
her
cheeks
burned
more
fiercely
than
ever
she
threw
herself
upon
her
neck
and
hid
her
face
but
did
not
utter
a
word
helen
felt
as
if
she
should
swoon
away
but
she
conquered
by
a
powerful
effort
her
sudden
sickening
faintness
and
releasing
her
arms
from
about
her
neck
she
bade
her
be
seated
and
herself
set
the
example
she
again
took
hand
in
her
own
and
pressed
it
darling
she
said
with
fervent
impressiveness
ask
you
i
implore
you
to
confide
in
me
to
be
truthful
and
unreserved
i
will
not
judge
you
harshly
be
this
the
proof
i
have
erred
sinfully
shamefully
erred
and
my
grievous
error
has
brought
with
it
no
light
punishment
listen
like
you
i
was
by
accident
thrown
into
the
society
of
one
who
was
personally
and
strikingly
handsome
and
whose
tone
of
thought
it
seemed
to
me
closely
resembled
my
own
in
all
things
as
we
were
then
situated
to
have
been
constantly
in
each
society
in
the
presence
of
friends
would
have
excited
remark
we
were
both
young
and
sensitive
and
were
desirous
of
evading
the
jests
of
those
by
whom
we
were
surrounded
especially
as
observations
respecting
our
liking
for
each
other
were
floating
about
among
those
who
were
eager
to
make
most
thoughtless
use
of
them
as
however
we
had
a
fondness
for
each
society
we
eluded
what
we
feared
by
contriving
clandestine
meetings
alas
alas
eva
the
dreadful
consequences
of
those
secret
meetings
the
promptings
of
passion
and
love
for
each
other
cast
in
one
fatal
moment
the
rules
of
purity
and
innocence
aside
and
i
became
the
victim
of
my
selfwill
a
victim
of
that
departure
from
truth
and
clear
integrity
which
commits
no
action
the
light
of
day
may
not
shine
upon
clandestine
meetings
forced
upon
me
a
dreadful
secret
clandestine
meetings
made
me
fly
my
home
clandestine
meetings
plunged
me
into
trial
and
affliction
horrors
of
which
you
can
have
no
conception
oh
my
dear
dear
eva
by
the
mercy
of
heaven
i
have
been
relieved
from
the
worse
consequences
of
my
sin
and
from
the
madness
of
an
ignoble
pride
let
me
implore
you
upon
my
knees
no
more
to
consent
to
a
secret
interview
with
anyone
in
form
again
what
it
may
be
necessary
for
him
to
say
or
you
to
hear
should
be
said
after
he
in
the
face
of
all
who
are
deeply
interested
in
your
welfare
has
frankly
acknowledged
his
affection
for
you
and
honourably
asked
permission
to
address
you
that
he
may
win
and
wear
you
before
the
whole
world
then
indeed
he
is
worthy
of
your
love
then
indeed
may
you
in
secret
listen
to
the
ardent
whispers
of
his
passion
but
oh
eva
dear
not
till
then
not
till
eva
still
embarrassed
and
confused
only
wept
and
in
so
doing
yet
more
affrighted
helen
she
stole
her
arm
about
her
waist
and
said
to
her
in
a
low
soft
voice
love
this
person
eva
whoever
he
may
be
that
i
see
now
tell
me
darling
how
and
when
he
first
declared
his
love
for
you
and
induced
you
to
give
him
your
heart
eva
looked
up
a
little
surprised
never
declared
any
love
for
me
helen
dear
she
replied
faintly
does
not
love
me
it
is
not
likely
he
love
you
asked
helen
with
surprise
no
she
answered
never
breathed
one
word
about
love
to
how
has
he
treated
you
inquired
helen
with
an
astonished
look
and
respectfully
oh
so
very
respectfully
so
painfully
respectfully
helen
replied
evangeline
with
more
animation
all
innocence
i
am
sure
i
arranged
with
him
to
meet
me
i
i
think
he
asked
me
to
do
so
i
am
sure
i
do
not
recollect
that
he
did
no
i
was
so
very
very
anxious
to
learn
tidings
of
you
that
in
fear
of
papa
i
think
i
said
i
would
come
where
i
could
hear
what
he
had
to
communicate
unheard
by
any
one
but
myself
he
always
met
me
and
treated
me
as
one
oh
so
far
superior
to
himself
and
now
that
we
have
all
been
thrown
into
such
deep
distress
he
is
yet
more
deferential
and
respectful
than
ever
not
distant
helen
but
as
if
he
thought
me
a
princess
now
if
i
had
been
a
lady
before
nay
he
would
not
have
deserted
me
and
mamma
though
we
had
have
been
thrust
forth
by
the
cruel
officers
into
the
street
for
he
said
he
would
have
provided
a
home
for
home
echoed
helen
hoarsely
she
believed
the
realization
of
her
fears
was
coming
now
with
his
sister
lotte
you
know
her
well
helen
she
is
very
amiable
i
believe
but
you
who
lived
with
her
for
some
time
can
best
helen
looked
upon
eva
perfectly
astounded
this
young
name
is
she
asked
pausing
at
the
last
word
replied
eva
softly
helen
drew
a
long
breath
rose
and
paced
the
room
again
after
a
few
turns
she
took
her
sister
in
her
arms
and
said
is
worthy
of
your
love
eva
for
i
doubt
not
that
you
have
won
his
helen
think
it
is
clear
and
in
such
a
case
he
has
acted
nobly
i
owe
a
debt
to
his
dear
sister
which
though
it
is
my
intention
to
endeavour
to
acknowledge
to
the
best
of
my
ability
is
yet
one
that
can
never
be
repaid
and
for
her
loved
and
loving
brother
charley
well
eva
when
this
cloud
which
has
settled
upon
our
house
has
passed
away
the
storm
is
in
its
intensity
now
we
shall
see
there
was
a
gentle
knock
at
the
door
as
she
concluded
and
on
the
permission
to
enter
being
given
the
subject
of
their
conversation
entered
his
face
was
pale
as
though
he
had
suffered
a
great
shock
his
mien
was
sad
even
solemn
both
eva
and
helen
noticed
it
instantly
together
they
exclaimed
name
what
has
happened
am
the
bearer
of
most
distressing
news
to
you
young
ladies
he
replied
in
a
grave
subdued
tone
costs
me
great
pain
to
fulfil
the
office
but
i
have
undertaken
it
that
the
announcement
may
have
nothing
added
to
its
poignancy
by
abrupt
the
two
sisters
clung
to
each
other
and
looked
upon
him
affrighted
me
prepare
you
he
said
receive
painful
intelligence
respecting
your
broke
from
lips
with
a
groan
charley
bowed
his
head
and
the
sisters
burst
into
tears
though
their
lamentations
bore
no
outward
violence
of
gesture
is
not
all
said
charley
sadly
his
mysterious
disappearance
an
experienced
detective
was
engaged
to
endeavour
to
find
him
and
after
most
arduous
labour
succeeded
in
tracing
him
to
the
vicinity
of
hendon
where
his
body
had
been
discovered
lifeless
upon
the
earth
nothing
was
found
upon
him
to
tell
who
he
was
and
after
a
inquest
was
held
bills
describing
the
body
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
had
been
found
were
put
forth
one
accidentally
caught
the
eye
of
the
detective
and
he
prosecuted
inquiries
in
that
neighbourhood
he
found
that
interment
had
taken
place
under
the
direction
of
the
parish
authorities
and
nothing
therefore
was
left
to
identify
the
unknown
but
his
clothes
and
a
handkerchief
man
has
recognised
them
and
thus
has
placed
beyond
doubt
his
sad
his
dreadful
both
sisters
were
in
a
convulsion
of
grief
and
charley
felt
most
distressed
for
he
knew
not
how
to
offer
them
consolation
but
as
he
knew
of
the
forged
deed
and
of
the
worst
crime
the
incitement
of
chewkle
to
commit
the
murder
of
old
wilton
he
could
only
say
to
them
it
be
some
consolation
to
you
ladies
to
know
that
unhappy
and
dreadful
as
this
event
proves
it
is
better
under
all
circumstances
that
it
has
so
so
grahame
had
after
all
died
a
death
and
had
received
a
funeral
such
was
the
end
of
an
imperious
pride
unsustained
by
the
principles
of
religion
and
morality
yet
more
grief
for
the
afflicted
girls
truebody
made
her
appearance
abruptly
in
the
room
she
tottered
rather
than
walked
to
the
two
sisters
yet
weeping
in
each
arms
she
pressed
her
hands
lightly
upon
their
shoulders
and
said
in
weeping
tones
dear
young
ladies
the
terrible
intelligence
you
have
just
heard
comes
not
alone
evils
seldom
do
the
sad
news
i
hear
can
but
add
to
a
grief
violent
enough
without
it
of
that
i
am
aware
but
it
does
not
come
without
a
consolation
if
it
has
pleased
heaven
to
remove
suddenly
your
afflicted
mother
from
this
world
it
has
released
her
also
from
suffering
and
a
calamity
which
must
have
been
a
grief
to
all
who
were
near
and
dear
to
her
poor
dear
afflicted
young
ladies
your
mother
is
no

sank
fainting
on
a
chair
charley
had
already
caught
evangeline
in
his
arms
as
she
suddenly
became
bereft
of
all
consciousness
chapter

the
causes

for

accomplishment

the
reading
a
homily
to
wilton
upon
the
cruelty
of
forcing
the
hand
to
be
given
without
the
heart
formed
no
portion
of
it
he
was
content
with
having
produced
a
striking
effect
and
he
suddenly
as
abruptly
as
he
had
spoken
rose
up
and
quitted
the
room
he
did
not
however
remain
away
long
but
returned
to
the
library
accompanied
by
solicitor
and
old
josh
maybee
during
the
interval
of
his
absence
wilton
shocked
by
the
disclosures
made
by
him
respecting
the
fate
of
the
grahame
family
had
certainly
had
some
grave
reflections
pass
through
his
mind
upon
the
mutability
of
human
affairs
as
well
as
upon
the
vanity
of
human
pride
but
these
sentiments
were
quickly
put
to
flight
by
an
inspection
of
law
papers
placed
before
him
by
his
solicitor
and
by
some
revelations
made
by
old
maybee
who
also
produced
those
documents
which
were
needful
to
identify
wilton
as
the
actual
legal
claimant
to
the
eglinton
estates
he
put
in
as
well
his
own
proofs
of
a
title
to
a
portion
of
the
property
in
question
which
wilton
directed
his
solicitor
to
examine
with
scrupulous
closeness
deeds
plans
statements
of
accounts
registers
were
spread
over
the
library
table
and
an
abstract
was
handed
to
wilton
which
he
devoured
with
avidity
for
it
gave
him
a
more
clear
and
definite
notion
of
the
value
and
extent
of
the
property
to
which
he
was
about
to
succeed
than
he
had
before
been
able
to
obtain
the
vastness
of
the
possessions
and
the
largeness
of
the
revenues
were
made
clear
in
this
paper
and
the
contemplation
of
it
fascinated
him
he
closed
his
eyes
and
lo
a
fair
vision
of
a
highly
cultivated
district
was
spread
out
before
him
the
woods
and
vales
the
sloping
hills
the
park
the
plantations
the
pastures
and
the
villages
and
a
numerous
tenantry
bowing
to
him
as
sole
owner
of
this
lordly
domain
successively
presented
themselves
to
him
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
the
reflections
inspired
by
nathan
observations
were
no
more
remembered
once
more
he
was
inflated
with
vain
glory
elated
by
his
accession
of
wealth
unmindful
of
past
services
received
oppressed
with
a
torrent
of
schemes
of
future
grandeur
and
more
than
ever
unprepared
to
accept
high
moral
principles
and
genuine
personal
worth
in
lieu
of
birth
and
rank
in
whatever
prospective
matrimonial
contract
might
be
formed
with
any
member
of
his
family
the
perusal
of
that
document
was
too
much
for
his
strength
of
mind
evidences
of
its
effects
upon
him
were
to
be
seen
on
his
flushed
cheek
in
the
excited
restless
expression
of
his
eye
and
the
dignified
tone
he
gradually
assumed
to
his
of
then
too
josh
maybee
received
by
him
in
a
frank
familiar
manner
suddenly
perceived
that
he
was
being
patronised
with
the
loftiest
air
imaginable
a
style
and
manner
which
wilton
continued
when
addressing
him
with
such
unvaried
uniformity
that
the
poor
old
fellow
began
to
imagine
and
ultimately
to
believe
that
through
a
long
course
of
years
he
must
have
been
under
the
deepest
obligations
to
him
barred
windows
prison
walls
and
an
age
of
griping
penury
nevertheless
that
he
was
now
only
too
much
honoured
in
being
permitted
to
be
the
actual
instrument
of
establishing
the
wilton
claim
he
certainly
felt
mystified
but
the
imperial
manner
of
wilton
towards
him
assured
him
that
it
must
be
all
right
then
too
he
was
so
graciously
condescending
to
nathan
gomer
waved
his
hand
to
him
and
smiled
as
a
sovereign
receiving
homage
while
seated
upon
his
throne
this
last
ebullition
rather
disconcerted
nathan
he
grinned
not
pleasantly
more
as
a
hyena
preparing
to
spring
upon
a
victim
ho
screeched
the
little
man
as
he
retired
to
a
window
and
looked
out
ho
he
condescends
to
me
me
who
have
done
so
little
for
him
ho
ho
so
good
of
him
ho
ho
so
beneficent
of
him
how
prostrated
with
thankfulness
i
ought
to
be
i
not
a
bit
of
it
not
a
morsel
i
must
be
a
fiend
of
ingratitude
his
heart
once
as
soft
as
pudding
is
becoming
steel
steep
it
in
vinegar
and
see
whether
that
will
dissolve
he
turned
back
to
where
wilton
was
seated
erect
listening
to
expositions
made
by
his
solicitor
and
regarding
with
an
attentive
scrutiny
some
of
the
documents
before
him
especially
those
which
had
reference
to
the
features
had
assumed
an
expression
such
as
they
seldom
wore
one
hard
disagreeable
and
unfriendly
he
addressed
the
solicitor
suggesting
that
in
weak
condition
it
would
be
prudent
to
defer
until
the
following
day
further
proceedings
such
signatures
as
were
immediately
required
he
had
obtained
altogether
he
said
looking
hard
at
wilton
thought
a
very
satisfactory
progress
had
been
wilton
loftily
assented
and
as
loftily
begged
nathan
gomer
to
do
the
honours
of
the
table
for
him
to
his
man
of
business
and
good
creature
maybee
as
he
did
not
then
feel
that
he
possessed
the
strength
necessary
for
such
proper
courtesy
such
very
proper
courtesy
nathan
displayed
his
teeth
and
accepted
the
post
of
honour
he
conducted
the
pair
to
the
where
he
introduced
them
to
mark
wilton
and
flora
he
whispered
a
few
words
into
ear
and
then
returned
to
the
library
old
josh
maybee
gazed
after
him
as
he
disappeared
and
said
to
mark
awfully
singular
elderly
little
gentleman
pray
do
you
know
who
he
really
is
added
the
solicitor
musingly
singularly
peculiar
personage
indeed
i
never
could
make
out
who
he
was
or
is
or
will
turn
out
to
little
fellow
enough
responded
mark
you
pose
me
when
you
ask
me
who
he
is
i
often
ask
myself
that
appears
to
be
very
and
to
have
a
generous
spirit
said
flora
should
like
to
know
who
he
really
is
he
comes
and
departs
so
mysteriously
he
seems
to
be
acquainted
with
everything
that
has
happened
or
is
about
to
take
place
papa
says
he
is
very
wealthy
nor
mously
wealthy
chimed
in
the
solicitor
speaking
emphatically
possesses
great
influence
over
individuals
continued
flora
seemingly
over
circumstances
i
have
great
faith
in
anything
he
may
predict
and
and
i
really
should
like
to
know
who
he
the
object
of
their
speculations
was
at
this
moment
alone
with
wilton
on
entering
the
library
he
strode
rather
than
walked
up
to
where
wilton
was
seated
still
poring
over
the
abstract
he
threw
himself
into
a
seat
with
a
sudden
violence
which
made
wilton
start
then
to
elevate
his
eyebrows
then
to
frown
this
person
this
gomer
was
assuming
a
familiarity
which
he
now
thought
it
would
be
proper
to
check
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
affected
a
distant
manner
have
something
to
communicate
to
me
gomer
i
apprehend
by
your
speedy
return
he
observed
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
paper
he
held
in
his
hand
have
wilton
he
said
curtly
very
good
time
too
i
think
to
say
it
now
that
you
are
all
but
installed
owner
of
your
large
wilton
coldly
inclined
his
head
he
exclaimed
nathan
made
a
grimace
he
coughed
gap
is
wide
which
separates
the
bench
from
eglinton
park
cheek
flushed
at
the
suggestion
he
coughed
too
a
gomer
he
said
are
contrasts
which
only
vulgar
minds
draw
wonder
is
the
offspring
of
ignorance
um
a
repeat
i
pray
such
pride
is
the
parent
of
evil
chuckled
gomer
i
used
to
write
that
in
a
however
i
have
not
come
here
to
make
reflections
or
to
bring
disagreeable
reminiscences
before
you
i
came
to
inform
you
that
the
day
after
you
will
have
to
appear
against
our
cunning
friend
chewkle
who
very
nearly
rendered
the
possession
of
the
eglinton
estates
a
matter
of
no
importance
to
atrocious
assassin
exclaimed
wilton
wonder
how
i
escaped
the
bullet
upon
such
favourable
you
not
know
asked
gomer
eyeing
him
keenly
a
well
by
the
providence
of
heaven
his
aim
was
bad
and
my
gamekeepers
were
at
hand
said
wilton
reflectively
it
was
a
fortunate
circumstance
that
they
were
near
or
the
wretch
would
have
slain
me
i
have
a
faint
remembrance
of
his
kneeling
upon
my
chest
of
him
whose
hand
clutched
the
scoundrel
by
the
throat
and
dragged
him
off
at
the
moment
his
hand
was
raised
to
terminate
your
existence
a
no
i
do
not
recollect
that
my
senses
left
me
but
i
shall
reward
that
individual
liberally
in
short
i
will
place
that
matter
in
your
hands
gomer
to
give
to
him
whatever
you
may
think
will
satisfy
him
um
a
with
my
you
serious
wilton
asked
gomer
almost
jeeringly
gomer
pray
inform
me
what
there
is
in
my
manner
or
tone
which
implies
that
i
have
descended
to
jest
on
this
subject
exclaimed
wilton
with
hauteur
nathan
gomer
laughed
and
rubbed
his
hands
asked
the
question
because
i
suspect
that
you
would
not
endorse
my
award
he
replied
do
not
comprehend
you
gomer
responded
wilton
still
in
the
same
distant
tone
i
appoint
you
to
manage
an
affair
for
me
giving
you
a
to
act
in
the
matter
i
consider
it
a
reflection
upon
my
honour
to
assume
that
i
should
be
dissatisfied
with
your
wilton
exclaimed
gomer
striking
the
table
a
sharp
angry
blow
individual
who
saved
your
life
at
the
most
critical
instant
of
its
jeopardy
would
spurn
a
money
wilton
opened
his
eyes
suspect
that
although
it
was
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
he
saved
yours
he
attaches
but
little
credit
to
his
deed
continued
gomer
he
would
have
acted
precisely
in
the
same
way
to
save
the
meanest
wretch
in
a
well
if
he
attaches
no
importance
to
the
act
said
wilton
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
the
air
of
one
who
considered
his
dignity
reflected
on
of
course
i
suggested
gomer
with
emphatic
shrillness
his
gallant
rescue
was
everything
in
the
world
to
you
children
harleydale
eglinton
all
all
therefore
though
he
may
view
his
conduct
with
disinterested
eyes
you
can
not
and
you
should
reward
him
a
i
must
suggest
that
there
is
a
wide
distinction
between
the
meanest
wretch
in
existence
and
a
a
the
owner
of
you
mean
interrupted
gomer
bluntly
is
exactly
why
you
should
reward
him
as
becomes
your
empower
you
to
do
so
said
wilton
with
a
most
dignified
gesture
said
gomer
are
also
indebted
to
him
not
only
for
the
life
but
the
preservation
of
your
wilton
started
and
fixed
upon
him
an
incredulous
stare
condition
after
you
received
your
wound
prevented
your
being
told
what
really
occasioned
the
illness
of
your
daughter
flora
said
gomer
impressively
me
briefly
explain
the
details
you
shall
be
made
acquainted
with
hereafter
your
late
guest
colonel
mires
who
began
life
by
plunging
from
gambling
into
forgery
and
whom
you
saved
from
destruction
by
timely
repairing
the
consequences
of
his
crime
who
in
turn
obtained
harleydale
for
you
conceived
a
passion
for
your
daughter
flora
had
some
such
suspicion
ejaculated
wilton
looking
aghast
as
if
he
feared
what
was
about
to
follow
sir
finding
that
the
field
was
occupied
continued
gomer
he
should
never
gain
your
consent
to
marry
her
nor
her
consent
to
have
him
acted
independently
of
both
and
carried
her
her
off
in
accordance
with
a
most
skilfully
devised
plot
he
bore
her
off
on
the
morning
on
which
that
knave
chewkle
fired
at
you
the
same
active
spirit
that
interfered
so
opportunely
in
your
favour
discovered
the
abduction
and
pursued
the
ravisher
he
succeeded
in
overtaking
in
rescuing
and
restoring
your
daughter
safely
to
her
home
there
was
a
pause
for
a
minute
then
nathan
gomer
said
drily
a
fellow
this
to
receive
a
money
wilton
made
two
or
three
efforts
to
speak
at
length
by
a
desperate
exertion
he
said
name
of
this
person
a
um
is
henry
vivian
replied
nathan
gomer
in
a
clear
sonorous
voice
wilton
sank
back
in
his
chair
was
it
possible
to
be
afflicted
with
more
vexatious
or
annoying
intelligence
than
this
had
it
been
anyone
else
his
liberality
would
have
known
no
bounds
but
to
be
indebted
to
this
who
aspired
to
an
alliance
with
his
house
for
the
lives
of
himself
and
daughter
was
intolerable
what
to
say
what
to
do
he
could
not
conceive
his
brain
was
in
a
whirl
he
remained
silent
nathan
gomer
fixed
his
bright
dancing
eyes
upon
him
award
wilton
to
vivian
for
his
earnest
services
to
you
and
your
daughter
would
have
been
to
bestow
the
hand
of
the
damsel
upon
him
in
accordance
with
the
maxim
that
the
deserve
the
but
i
presume
as
i
said
before
that
you
would
not
endorse
my
award
though
i
more
than
half
suspect
the
young
lady
would
herself
do
so
with
a
ready
wilton
quitted
his
chair
and
paced
his
room
a
movement
he
usually
resorted
to
when
his
mind
was
agitated
suddenly
he
paused
and
stood
before
gomer
and
said
in
an
excited
manner
were
correct
gomer
in
supposing
that
i
should
not
endorse
any
such
award
perfectly
correct
such
a
notion
is
preposterous
wild
romantic
a
a
foolery
i
a
i
am
a
on
a
ship
with
my
daughter
we
both
fall
into
the
sea
a
a
a
brave
sailor
jumps
in
and
saves
us
both
am
i
am
i
to
give
my
hand
to
that
sailor
i
admire
him
i
honour
his
bravery
and
would
reward
it
a
but
with
my
hand
a
never
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
astoundingly
why
a
gomer
you
do
not
look
much
like
a
susceptible
romantic
personage
you
can
hardly
feel
it
your
business
make
two
young
hearts
beat
in
happy
unison
interrupted
gomer
sharply
i
do
why
not
why
should
i
not
eh
permit
me
to
ask
why
i
should
not
i
help
my
looks
a
diamond
you
know
has
an
ugly
crust
but
because
i
am
a
dwarf
and
look
as
if
i
performed
ablutions
in
turmeric
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
i
should
have
a
lump
of
granite
for
a
gomer
you
are
a
rich
and
a
a
man
of
the
world
a
responded
wilton
am
both
answered
gomer
emphatically
am
a
man
of
the
world
and
i
see
that
like
boys
after
butterflies
the
majority
of
my
kind
pursue
objects
as
gaudy
and
as
useless
when
caught
i
see
the
hollowness
of
most
human
purposes
the
eagerness
with
which
they
are
pursued
and
the
wretched
vexed
vanities
they
prove
to
be
when
possessed
i
am
rich
wilton
but
i
apprehend
the
true
purpose
of
riches
to
be
something
different
to
aggrandisement
the
world
is
full
of
woe
the
mission
of
wealth
is
to
alleviate
it
also
to
assist
and
to
elevate
human
worth
and
to
plant
happiness
where
it
has
not
been
wont
to
bloom
such
have
been
the
objects
of
my
and
such
i
trust
they
will
continue
to
be
i
do
not
however
pretend
to
attempt
to
control
your
actions
or
guide
you
in
the
performance
of
your
duties
that
must
be
your
own
task
i
simply
reiterate
what
my
award
to
vivian
would
have
been
and
now
i
expect
you
will
take
upon
yourself
the
office
of
acknowledging
the
debt
of
gratitude
you
owe
to
him
rather
a
heavy
obligation
to
my
thinking
and
the
consideration
of
the
meet
reward
you
will
bestow
upon
wilton
after
a
little
reflection
said
appears
to
me
in
looking
back
on
the
past
gomer
that
a
that
you
have
exercised
a
considerable
i
might
say
a
very
considerable
influence
over
my
actions
and
have
directed
generally
the
course
of
my
inclinations
a
a
and
my
intentions
even
now
a
though
disclaiming
such
purpose
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
occupied
i
a
should
say
actively
occupied
in
forcing
me
to
swallow
a
potion
most
repugnant
to
a
to
to
my
nature
seeking
to
impel
me
by
honeyed
words
concerning
the
good
which
a
a
must
result
from
my
acquiescence
a
stay
interrupt
me
now
i
would
fain
acknowledge
that
you
have
hitherto
shown
the
greatest
interest
in
my
personal
affairs
that
i
say
i
think
is
undoubtedly
clear
it
is
also
plain
and
undeniable
that
your
a
um
your
interference
hitherto
has
been
attended
with
the
best
possible
result
that
i
admit
it
might
in
the
present
instance
i
say
it
might
i
am
by
no
means
supposed
to
think
it
would
but
it
might
operate
beneficially
if
it
succeeded
in
making
me
believe
that
it
would
be
at
least
proper
to
bestow
the
hand
of
my
daughter
upon
vivian
but
before
i
consent
to
the
case
and
listen
to
a
repetition
of
your
arguments
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
who
you
are
and
explain
to
me
why
you
a
comparative
stranger
merely
the
landlord
of
a
house
i
once
inhabited
should
have
mixed
yourself
up
with
my
affairs
and
now
take
upon
yourself
to
direct
me
in
the
disposal
of
my
children
in
nathan
gomer
rubbed
his
hands
briskly
over
his
chin
and
mouth
and
champed
with
his
teeth
as
though
his
tongue
and
lips
were
parched
presently
he
spoke
his
voice
grated
harshly
at
first
ha
very
true
he
said
with
a
grim
chuckle
never
reflected
upon
that
very
grave
consideration
title
to
interfere
in
your
affairs
it
did
not
occur
to
me
i
grant
you
i
have
been
impertinent
officious
i
ought
to
have
left
you
to
no
he
checked
himself
with
a
sudden
dignity
must
not
permit
myself
to
be
betrayed
into
a
weakness
wilton
you
have
smitten
me
on
one
cheek
before
i
permit
you
to
smite
the
other
i
will
inform
you
who
i
am
not
at
this
moment
but
at
the
proper
time
it
will
come
to
your
ears
with
sufficient
speed
when
it
does
come
a
gomer
stay
cried
wilton
hurriedly
but
gomer
was
gone
the
old
man
would
have
followed
him
but
a
servant
entered
the
library
followed
by
the
honorable
lester
vane
vane
was
dressed
with
studied
elegance
his
garb
was
in
the
highest
style
of
fashion
and
fitted
him
to
perfection
having
quite
recovered
his
health
of
which
recently
he
had
purposely
taken
the
greatest
possible
care
he
looked
as
he
walked
with
an
elevated
gait
affected
and
acquired
by
practice
a
very
handsome
and
polished
specimen
of
the
aristocracy
wilton
was
immediately
struck
by
his
appearance
and
manner
the
words
rang
in
his
ears
too
as
the
servant
announced
him
he
had
before
noticed
the
superiority
of
mien
and
attire
displayed
by
vane
but
under
existing
circumstances
they
now
made
a
stronger
impression
than
ever
upon
him
here
evidently
was
the
proper
to
his
own
and
his
condition
in
life
nathan
gomer
might
preach
as
much
as
he
pleased
about
two
young
hearts
beating
in
happy
unison
but
was
it
possible
that
such
would
be
the
result
of
an
unequal
match
it
was
far
more
likely
that
flora
wedded
to
a
young
elegant
fellow
like
lester
and
moving
after
her
marriage
with
him
in
a
high
circle
would
be
much
gayer
and
happier
than
if
mated
with
one
who
had
been
accustomed
only
to
the
atmosphere
of
a
workshop
and
to
mix
with
very
moderate
people
wilton
felt
decided
upon
the
point
and
accordingly
greeted
lester
vane
with
evident
pleasure
which
that
astute
personage
responded
to
with
consummate
artifice
by
his
observations
and
his
inquiries
he
led
wilton
to
the
conclusion
that
he
possessed
a
noble
spirit
and
unaffected
kindness
of
heart
he
even
offered
to
give
back
to
wilton
the
promise
he
had
received
from
him
of
hand
and
assured
him
with
earnestness
that
however
deeply
painful
and
even
it
might
be
to
him
to
forego
the
honour
of
miss
alliance
he
would
rather
sacrifice
his
eternal
happiness
than
be
the
occasion
of
one
grief
to
her
he
had
come
down
he
said
with
the
object
of
either
being
able
to
disabuse
mind
of
its
false
idea
in
respect
to
vivian
and
to
win
her
love
or
to
resign
her
hand
and
retire
from
the
field
altogether
an
alternative
which
old
wilton
rather
vehemently
the
measured
manner
in
which
vane
expressed
himself
and
the
earnestness
which
led
old
wilton
to
be
explicit
in
his
views
and
wishes
occasioned
some
time
to
be
consumed
before
the
latter
could
fulfil
his
intention
floating
through
his
mind
all
the
while
he
was
talking
with
his
new
guest
not
to
suffer
gomer
abruptly
to
depart
and
in
anger
too
so
as
soon
as
he
could
conveniently
take
the
opportunity
he
rang
his
bell
and
bade
his
servant
acquaint
gomer
that
he
should
be
glad
of
a
few
words
with
him
gone
sir
and
taken
old
gentleman
with
him
replied
the
man
other
old
gentleman
repeated
wilton
with
surprise
sir
one
of
they
two
that
came
with
him
sir
replied
the
man
asked
wilton
startled
know
which
replied
the
man
with
a
stupid
expression
of
countenance
mark
he
do
sir
because
gomer
spoke
to
him
before
he
left
the
hall
mark
to
me
exclaimed
wilton
sharply
the
man
disappeared
and
in
a
few
minutes
mark
wilton
made
his
appearance
he
greeted
lester
vane
with
stern
and
haughty
coldness
conduct
his
father
viewed
with
irritation
though
he
made
no
remark
then
in
reference
to
it
but
confined
himself
to
the
matter
upon
which
he
had
sent
for
him
hear
mark
he
said
gomer
has
left
the
hall
for
the
railway
station
is
it
so
sir
answered
mark
with
surprise
are
aware
of
that
fact
he
informed
me
that
he
had
parted
with
with
me
sir
he
expressed
himself
i
thought
rather
emphatically
but
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
very
great
hurry
and
took
that
singular
companion
of
his
maybee
with
echoed
wilton
in
a
tone
of
alarm
he
looked
hastily
over
the
papers
still
on
the
table
but
all
the
documents
which
maybee
had
produced
needful
to
support
claim
to
the
large
estates
in
chancery
were
yet
there
what
then
could
gomer
mean
by
withdrawing
him
solicitor
is
still
here
he
exclaimed
addressing
mark
left
him
in
conversation
with
my
sister
sir
replied
mark
will
dine
with
us
in
fact
he
does
not
return
to
london
until
the
morning
said
his
father
vane
will
also
be
our
guest
for
a
for
a
for
the
present
you
will
conduct
him
to
your
sister
and
charlock
my
excellent
man
of
business
quite
a
gentleman
i
assure
you
the
bowed
wealthy
man
and
of
high
standing
in
his
profession
added
wilton
vane
bowed
again
have
a
high
esteem
for
men
of
the
legal
profession
he
said
are
agreeable
company
they
are
acute
men
intelligent
full
of
anecdote
and
from
the
very
character
of
their
position
and
acquirements
wilton
rubbed
his
hands
he
was
pleased
with
the
reply
am
desirous
of
a
little
quiet
just
now
he
observed
shall
therefore
have
an
hour
or
so
to
myself
in
my
sanctum
here
alone
but
i
will
join
you
at
dinner
it
was
not
my
intention
to
have
done
so
but
i
feel
equal
now
to
the
pleasure
i
shall
enjoy
mark
i
place
vane
under
your
charge
i
am
sure
you
will
pay
him
every
mark
made
a
cold
inclination
of
the
head
and
left
the
library
followed
by
vane
who
perceived
his
coolness
but
he
had
too
great
a
game
at
stake
to
appear
to
do
so
or
to
appear
to
be
affected
by
it
he
himself
assumed
a
proud
air
and
took
his
way
after
mark
wilton
who
walked
with
a
quick
step
at
an
easy
leisurely
pace
mark
again
wondered
where
he
had
seen
vane
and
under
what
circumstances
he
felt
morally
convinced
that
they
had
met
before
and
that
the
impressions
left
behind
were
not
favourable
to
lester
in
vain
he
endeavoured
to
solve
the
difficulty
his
memory
would
not
serve
him
in
this
again
lester
vane
and
flora
were
face
to
face
but
under
different
conditions
she
received
him
although
her
heart
beat
for
she
knew
he
was
her
favoured
suitor
for
her
hand
with
a
quiet
firm
manner
as
though
his
arrival
was
an
incident
of
ordinary
character
and
she
listened
to
his
hyperboles
as
if
they
were
but
she
replied
by
a
silent
inclination
of
the
head
and
resumed
her
conversation
with
charlock
with
an
unembarrassed
ease
which
affected
vane
more
keenly
than
any
studied
slight
would
have
done
he
could
have
supplied
a
motive
for
that
and
have
surmounted
or
have
attempted
to
have
surmounted
it
hopefully
for
it
would
have
shown
to
him
that
he
was
not
an
object
of
indifference
but
to
be
received
as
flora
had
met
him
was
to
satisfy
him
that
she
was
in
no
doubt
as
to
the
disposal
of
her
preference
or
that
it
would
be
adhered
to
he
felt
by
her
manner
that
he
was
accepted
by
her
as
a
guest
of
her
whose
coming
and
going
could
have
no
influence
or
effect
upon
her
he
mentally
determined
to
change
this
state
of
things
at
any
risk
uncouth
booby
of
a
brother
cuts
me
he
mused
care
nothing
for
that
but
she
shall
not
do
so
with
impunity
i
will
have
her
no
risk
shall
daunt
me
no
obstacle
deter
me
for
it
is
not
alone
her
wealth
i
need
but
i
have
conceived
a
passion
for
such
were
his
thoughts
as
he
gazed
upon
her
while
she
was
speaking
to
her
solicitor
she
was
so
beautiful
so
very
very
beautiful
that
the
more
his
eyes
perused
her
fair
lineaments
the
more
deep
became
his
determination
not
to
be
shaken
off
but
she
never
turned
her
eyes
towards
him
and
when
by
her
quietly
dropping
her
share
in
the
conversation
it
rested
between
him
and
charlock
she
silently
glided
from
the
room
had
it
not
been
for
the
presence
of
charlock
mark
would
have
followed
her
example
as
it
was
he
spoke
but
seldom
to
vane
who
treated
him
with
corresponding
carelessness
it
was
a
relief
to
mark
when
they
separated
to
dress
for
dinner
and
on
reassembling
flora
did
not
appear
she
complained
of
not
being
well
and
they
had
to
proceed
without
her
mark
confined
his
observations
to
charlock
and
wilton
irritated
angry
and
feverish
was
compelled
to
keep
vane
in
countenance
as
well
as
he
could
the
task
was
too
much
for
him
and
he
found
himself
compelled
from
weakness
to
retire
to
his
chamber
the
moment
the
cloth
was
cleared
the
solicitor
was
an
abstemious
and
an
early
man
and
as
he
was
compelled
to
quit
harleydale
for
london
at
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
he
rose
from
the
table
almost
as
soon
as
the
wine
was
circulated
after
a
short
interview
with
wilton
and
obtaining
possession
of
all
the
valuable
legal
papers
he
retired
to
rest
mark
and
vane
were
thus
left
alone
a
silence
of
at
least
ten
minutes
elapsed
neither
spoke
several
times
vane
had
cast
furtive
glances
at
mark
and
felt
convinced
he
was
thinking
about
him
presently
he
placed
his
hand
upon
the
decanter
before
him
and
said
little
wine
with
you
would
be
very
agreeable
mark
bowed
slightly
and
sipped
his
wine
again
a
silence
ensued
and
soon
thoughts
were
far
away
quiet
pale
sad
face
rose
up
before
him
and
her
thoughtful
eyes
seemed
to
be
turned
appealingly
upon
him
for
help
and
aid
suddenly
a
flush
of
heat
passed
across
his
features
his
eye
kindled
brightly
and
his
brow
lowered
he
turned
to
lester
vane
and
in
a
sharp
tone
said
have
met
vane
looked
at
him
somewhat
surprised
at
the
suddenness
of
his
remark
and
at
its
tone
with
equal
quickness
it
occurred
to
him
that
mark
recollected
only
at
this
moment
the
scene
in
hyde
park
he
was
prepared
for
what
was
coming
and
replied
quietly
on
my
last
visit
sir
we
encountered
each
other
in
this
house
look
at
my
face
well
sir
listen
to
the
tone
of
my
voice
and
then
tell
me
if
your
memory
does
not
furnish
you
with
the
circumstances
under
which
we
on
a
former
occasion
confronted
each
vane
returned
calmly
his
angry
gaze
and
with
a
most
collected
manner
replied
for
your
earnestness
wilton
i
should
imagine
you
were
jesting
upon
my
honour
i
am
unconscious
of
having
had
the
satisfaction
of
meeting
you
previous
to
our
introduction
met
sir
in
hyde
park
one
evening
commenced
mark
rather
impetuously
vane
stayed
him
pardon
wilton
he
said
what
month
mark
replied
promptly
vane
shook
his
head
coolly
and
returned
was
not
in
london
i
was
in
oxford
cried
mark
as
if
he
could
not
believe
his
ears

repeated
vane
slowly
enunciating
his
words
give
you
my
word
such
is
the
fact
and
if
the
occasion
to
which
you
may
refer
be
of
importance
to
you
i
will
in
order
to
set
you
right
on
the
matter
produce
within
a
few
days
proofs
that
i
am
simply
stating
what
as
a
gentleman
i
have
a
claim
my
bare
word
should
guarantee
the
mark
swallowed
a
glass
of
wine
he
could
say
no
more
at
present
he
felt
convinced
that
vane
was
the
man
he
had
seen
in
companionship
with
those
who
had
insulted
lotte
and
he
determined
to
pursue
the
subject
until
he
had
either
proved
him
a
liar
and
a
debauchee
or
confess
that
in
this
instance
at
least
he
was
mis
taken
he
took
the
first
opportunity
of
excusing
himself
and
left
vane
alone
alone
to
reflect
on
his
position
to
examine
carefully
the
opposition
he
should
have
to
contend
with
from
what
quarter
it
would
proceed
what
would
be
its
power
and
how
it
was
to
be
crushed
must
learn
more
before
i
can
proceed
upon
my
course
he
muttered
thing
is
clear
this
wilful
beauty
has
given
herself
heart
and
soul
to
that
fellow
vivian
and
i
have
no
other
rival
to
fear
it
will
not
be
so
difficult
to
dispose
of
him
if
i
have
time
i
must
have
time
yet
my
necessities
push
me
on
to
a
i
will
wait
and
see
what
brings
forth
a
day
may
do
much
one
thing
i
swear
if
i
fail
she
shall
never
have
him
never
his
face
assumed
a
demoniacal
aspect
it
was
but
a
moment
only
that
it
was
so
ruffled
he
heard
an
approaching
footstep
and
his
features
became
placid
and
serene
as
though
there
raged
not
beneath
emotions
of
carking
anxieties
of
dread
solicitude
and
almost
despairing
apprehension

bickekstaff
brought
with
it
to
lester
vane
a
long
with
wilton
neither
flora
nor
mark
were
visible
to
him
and
charlock
had
gone
to
london
during
this
interview
he
learned
to
his
dismay
the
whole
of
colonel
proceedings
as
mark
had
that
morning
at
his
request
detailed
to
his
father
all
that
had
occurred
in
reference
to
the
abduction
of
flora
he
learned
the
particulars
of
murderous
attempt
and
that
in
both
cases
harry
vivian
had
been
the
hero
who
had
saved
father
and
daughter
it
was
information
of
a
startling
and
a
grave
kind
to
him
he
was
quite
enough
master
of
character
to
comprehend
how
securely
such
acts
would
establish
vivian
in
heart
and
of
human
nature
to
know
that
if
pride
could
be
removed
he
would
in
all
other
respects
delight
in
vivian
as
a
for
although
angry
and
irritated
with
him
for
what
he
considered
the
presumption
of
aspiring
to
his
hand
yet
wilton
never
failed
to
speak
of
him
in
all
respects
as
in
a
high
degree
worthy
his
regard
and
esteem
lester
vane
therefore
saw
that
vivian
was
his
great
obstruction
and
that
he
must
be
cleared
from
his
path
before
he
could
himself
make
the
least
advance
he
determined
upon
reflection
to
speak
in
high
terms
of
him
to
wilton
especially
to
mark
or
flora
if
he
had
the
chance
and
to
congratulate
hal
himself
if
he
happened
to
meet
with
him
though
it
cost
him
an
apology
for
his
former
insolence
he
resolved
and
wisely
to
be
governed
in
all
he
did
by
the
form
circumstances
might
take
and
without
attempting
to
control
them
to
guide
them
into
the
direction
he
wished
them
to
pursue
above
all
with
grating
teeth
he
resolved
to
be
effectually
rid
of
his
rival
not
by
the
vulgar
means
of
knife
or
poison
there
were
other
ways
of
destroying
him
than
that
he
hoped
to
slay
his
moral
character
and
that
he
decided
should
be
his
first
move
when
the
right
moment
came
to
set
it
in
motion
old
wilton
had
to
attend
at
the
town
hall
of
a
neighbouring
borough
to
appear
against
chewkle
and
to
give
his
evidence
before
the
magistrates
respecting
the
murderous
attack
he
had
made
upon
him
he
was
aware
that
he
should
have
to
meet
there
henry
vivian
to
expatiate
upon
his
timely
interposition
in
his
favour
to
laud
him
for
his
pursuit
of
colonel
mires
and
the
rescue
of
his
daughter
he
felt
as
he
meditated
on
this
that
he
ought
to
be
grateful
to
him
and
to
display
it
but
then
the
exhibition
of
a
generous
warmth
on
his
part
might
raise
hopes
he
was
most
anxious
to
repress
so
he
was
bewildered
as
to
the
part
he
ought
to
play
then
too
he
was
feverish
and
petulant
he
missed
gentle
attentions
ah
in
truth
he
sorely
missed
her
from
the
moment
she
had
quitted
him
nothing
seemed
to
have
gone
right
he
missed
her
offices
always
performed
so
exactly
as
he
wished
them
to
be
he
missed
her
soft
voice
which
had
such
power
to
soothe
and
allay
his
peevish
fretfulness
and
he
missed
her
gentle
smile
which
had
never
failed
to
gladden
his
heart
and
dispose
it
to
a
generous
sympathy
with
the
world
and
all
whom
it
contained
never
since
her
absence
had
he
missed
her
so
much
as
on
the
morning
he
had
to
face
the
fatigue
of
giving
his
evidence
on
the
examination
of
chewkle
he
was
so
sure
he
should
have
been
prepared
to
undergo
the
exertion
by
her
admirable
arrangements
and
he
was
so
convinced
that
she
would
by
her
presence
have
sustained
him
throughout
his
meeting
with
vivian
but
he
had
to
do
it
all
without
her
for
very
obvious
reasons
he
declined
offer
to
accompany
him
he
felt
assured
there
was
no
advantage
to
be
derived
from
giving
her
the
opportunity
of
seeing
young
vivian
if
she
did
not
speak
to
him
she
had
in
fact
seen
him
too
often
as
it
was
so
accompanied
by
his
son
mark
and
lester
vane
he
went
to
the
town
hall
but
ere
he
departed
from
his
library
he
formed
a
design
respecting
lotte
one
he
purposed
keeping
to
himself
until
he
could
put
it
into
execution
he
made
a
firm
resolve
to
be
no
more
placed
in
the
predicament
in
which
he
felt
himself
to
be
that
morning
and
so
he
reached
the
town
hall
which
was
thronged
with
curious
spectators
the
attempt
on
life
had
been
noised
all
over
the
county
and
the
gentry
and
farmers
for
miles
round
came
to
hear
the
examination
they
came
to
see
too
wilton
his
history
was
well
known
as
well
as
his
understood
successful
claim
to
the
eglinton
estates
great
curiosity
was
evinced
to
see
the
rich
landed
proprietor
who
had
lived
for
years
little
better
than
a
beggar
in
london
three
was
a
somewhat
anxious
desire
on
the
part
of
the
fair
sex
too
to
have
a
peep
at
the
young
gentleman
who
had
saved
life
report
had
declared
him
to
be
the
very
handsomest
of
fine
young
fellows
that
miss
wilton
had
fallen
passionately
in
love
with
him
and
was
to
be
married
to
him
in
a
month
that
she
had
selected
her
and
was
looking
up
her
bridesmaids
there
was
a
very
general
morbid
curiosity
also
to
gaze
on
chewkle
chewkle
whose
race
was
run
chewkle
who
had
possessed
such
faith
in
having
the
luck
which
was
he
possessed
it
no
more
it
had
deserted
him
now
he
knew
it
and
looked
into
the
future
with
a
vacant
stare
and
blank
despair
when
first
made
prisoner
and
incarcerated
he
forwarded
a
letter
to
grahame
in
which
he
briefly
stated
that
events
had
proved
untoward
and
called
upon
him
to
hasten
to
release
him
by
some
means
from
his
dilemma
no
answer
was
returned
to
his
epistle
he
wrote
again
intimating
that
unless
his
employer
made
his
appearance
revelations
would
be
made
still
no
answer
chewkle
was
devoured
with
sickening
anxiety
and
dropped
a
line
to
his
passionately
attached
friend
jukes
asking
him
to
call
upon
grahame
and
wake
him
up
he
gave
him
a
few
hints
to
use
which
would
be
likely
to
terrify
the
proud
man
as
coming
from
a
stranger
and
he
signed
himself
but
jukes
was
a
rat
who
skulked
from
a
sinking
ship
so
he
burned
the
letter
and
swore
to
himself
that
he
had
never
received
it
chewkle
grew
desperate
at
being
thus
deserted
and
he
gave
grahame
as
he
said
more
chance
in
another
and
last
epistle
he
spoke
out
very
plainly
he
alluded
to
incitement
to
murder
of
the
forgery
they
had
together
committed
and
he
ended
by
informing
grahame
that
if
he
did
not
proceed
instanter
to
the
thing
that
was
right
he
should
make
a
clean
breast
of
all
if
i
am
lagged
for
life
he
said
shall
go
with
me
even
if
we
should
be
in
the
same
gang
and
chained
together
up
to
our
buzzums
in
water
until
one
of
us
turns
up
his
this
more
expressive
than
elegant
epistle
met
with
no
better
fate
than
the
others
grahame
was
then
where
no
missive
or
threat
of
chewkle
could
reach
him
chewkle
hoped
against
hope
until
the
last
moment
then
he
determined
to
give
up
name
and
request
of
the
authorities
that
that
gentleman
might
be
taken
into
custody
he
did
so
on
the
morning
of
the
examination
and
was
then
informed
that
grahame
was
dead
and
also
that
the
contents
of
his
notes
had
been
carefully
perused
before
they
had
quitted
the
chewkle
listened
to
this
announcement
with
a
spasm
of
agony
his
future
was
before
him
penal
servitude
for
life
without
a
hope
of
escape
so
when
he
appeared
at
the
dock
with
haggard
face
bloodshot
eyes
shaggy
brows
and
stubbly
beard
people
in
court
shrunk
back
and
believed
him
quite
capable
of
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged
the
examination
extended
to
no
great
length
wilton
who
acted
the
patrician
with
consummate
art
gave
his
evidence
in
a
somewhat
stately
and
rambling
manner
but
vivian
whose
looks
realised
all
the
expectations
of
the
fair
owners
of
the
many
bright
eyes
turned
upon
him
recounted
his
share
in
the
transaction
with
a
clear
conciseness
and
a
modesty
which
elicited
encomium
from
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
and
a
compliment
from
the
magistrates
other
evidence
was
produced
and
chewkle
who
under
the
advice
of
his
solicitor
said
nothing
and
nothing
exculpatory
had
he
to
say
was
fully
committed
for
trial
at
the
next
assizes
which
however
were
not
due
for
some
two
or
three
months
to
come
chewkle
was
therefore
consigned
to
gaol
to
await
that
period
and
wilton
attended
by
his
son
and
lester
vane
returned
back
to
harleydale
hall
they
did
not
encounter
vivian
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
though
mark
had
looked
for
him
and
lester
vane
too
until
he
was
called
upon
to
give
his
evidence
then
he
suddenly
rose
up
in
the
vicinity
of
the
as
if
by
magic
performed
the
duty
required
of
him
and
retired
to
be
no
more
visible
to
the
eyes
which
searched
for
him
that
day
all
the
way
from
harleydale
to
the
town
hall
wilton
had
been
mentally
occupied
by
him
he
considered
himself
slighted
he
so
wealthy
holding
now
such
a
position
he
should
be
at
least
for
his
county
before
long
and
for
this
vivian
this
boy
not
to
appear
before
him
and
express
wilton
could
not
define
what
sentiments
hal
ought
to
have
delivered
himself
of
he
rested
with
feelings
irritated
and
annoyed
at
his
absence
he
let
his
feelings
at
last
betray
themselves
mark
looked
at
him
with
surprise
sir
he
said
curtly
you
expect
vivian
to
hunt
you
out
to
present
himself
to
you
hat
in
hand
and
thank
you
for
the
honour
of
having
been
permitted
to
save
your
life
and
flora
from
worse
than
mark
you
presume
rejoined
his
father
fiercely
mark
made
no
reply
and
the
rest
of
the
journey
home
was
made
in
silence
flora
sure
that
she
should
hear
all
that
had
transpired
from
mark
kept
her
room
on
the
plea
of
indisposition
a
just
one
for
she
too
was
feverish
excited
and
certainly
indisposed
to
meet
lester
vane
and
to
bevexed
by
his
incessant
stare
and
his
unpleasing
attention
old
wilton
on
reaching
harleydale
again
missed
the
face
of
his
little
his
house
seemed
a
desert
without
her
his
room
seemed
gloomy
without
the
sunshine
of
her
eyes
or
the
music
of
her
voice
he
said
nothing
but
he
speculated
upon
her
condition
is
a
young
lady
in
reduced
circumstances
he
thought
will
make
this
a
home
for
her
flora
will
be
married
and
away
from
me
mark
among
the
splendid
beauties
of
an
elevated
circle
will
soon
forget
the
artful
sempstress
who
inveigled
herself
into
his
affections
he
does
not
speak
of
her
now
a
good
sign
he
will
marry
and
have
an
establishment
of
his
own
then
then
i
will
place
my
little
pet
to
preside
over
my
household
i
shall
have
all
my
wishes
consulted
and
all
my
requirements
attended
to
i
will
make
an
excuse
to
go
to
london
flora
knows
her
address
and
i
will
go
to
her
and
make
short
work
of
it
i
am
weary
of
this
he
however
wanted
not
an
excuse
to
go
to
london
he
was
electrified
by
receiving
a
letter
from
his
solicitor
who
informed
him
that
he
had
been
served
with
a
notice
from
a
new
claimant
to
the
estates
of
the
late
eglinton
and
who
was
at
once
about
to
prosecute
his
claim
he
advanced
his
title
as
a
lineal
descendant
from
an
elder
branch
of
the
family
and
upon
referring
to
the
genealogical
tree
the
solicitor
said
he
feared
his
claim
was
only
too
well
founded
he
however
begged
wilton
to
come
to
london
at
once
and
confer
with
him
upon
the
course
to
be
adopted
in
this
singular
and
unexpected
turn
of
affairs
wilton
read
and
this
letter
a
dozen
times
what
was
the
cup
of
grandeur
to
be
dashed
from
his
mouth
while
yet
sparkling
and
bubbling
on
his
lips
new
claimant
of
an
elder
branch
of
the
family
the
very
notion
made
him
perspire
for
he
had
at
once
a
dim
remembrance
that
nathan
gomer
had
mentioned
that
fact
but
had
suggested
that
the
descent
was
broken
or
had
disappeared
he
could
not
now
recollect
beyond
that
his
singular
little
friend
had
assured
him
there
was
no
occasion
to
fear
any
interposition
from
that
quarter
yet
here
it
was
upon
an
impulse
he
swallowed
humble
pie
and
wrote
off
to
nathan
gomer
asking
him
to
come
down
at
once
to
harleydale
for
he
much
needed
the
services
of
his
and
proved
friend
once
more
his
letter
was
returned
to
him
unopened
what
did
this
mean
who
after
all
could
nathan
gomer
be
another
letter
arrived
from
his
solicitor
more
urgent
than
before
calling
for
his
immediate
presence
in
london
and
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
comply
with
its
appeal
he
conferred
with
mark
adopting
a
different
manner
and
language
towards
him
to
that
which
he
had
lately
used
and
his
son
announced
his
intention
to
accompany
him
to
london
as
flora
could
not
well
be
left
behind
it
was
decided
that
she
should
go
with
them
too
wilton
was
perforce
obliged
to
inform
lester
vane
of
the
change
in
their
arrangements
but
he
was
warmly
requested
to
make
the
house
in
park
his
own
as
it
were
while
they
remained
in
town
the
change
did
not
suit
vane
he
had
several
private
reasons
which
rendered
a
return
to
london
especially
inconvenient
but
he
could
only
submit
to
the
alteration
and
offer
to
journey
with
them
to
the
great
metropolis
which
offer
wilton
accepted
readily
was
one
which
was
not
a
little
distasteful
to
flora
once
again
their
dwelling
adjoining
was
tenanted
by
them
and
with
no
small
pleasure
by
two
of
the
family
by
flora
because
coming
to
london
was
to
be
where
hal
dwelt
to
breathe
the
same
atmosphere
with
him
to
be
within
reach
any
moment
of
his
presence
to
be
within
sound
of
his
voice
within
the
beams
from
his
eyes
to
feel
that
she
was
under
the
shadow
of
his
protection
and
that
his
glance
hovered
over
her
path
wheresoever
she
went
to
preserve
her
from
danger
and
guard
her
from
insult
to
mark
the
change
was
delicious
for
he
was
near
to
lotte
near
to
where
he
might
could
would
should
must
see
her
again
to
reason
with
her
combat
her
prejudices
and
make
a
lady
of
her
whether
she
would
or
no
do
her
principles
a
violence
that
he
might
for
so
long
as
he
should
live
prove
to
her
how
dearly
and
devotedly
he
loved
her
interviews
with
his
legal
adviser
successively
taking
place
day
after
day
were
the
reverse
of
satisfactory
to
him
he
felt
the
estates
he
had
so
much
coveted
and
the
near
possession
of
which
had
so
lifted
him
out
of
himself
slipping
rapidly
out
of
his
fingers
the
new
claimant
who
seemed
to
be
animated
with
a
vindictive
feeling
against
wilton
bore
the
name
of
eglinton
he
pushed
on
his
claim
with
all
the
speed
of
which
the
law
would
admit
and
without
omitting
an
opportunity
or
advantage
it
gave
him
so
clear
at
last
did
his
case
appear
that
own
solicitor
suggested
an
arrangement
between
the
parties
by
which
the
enormous
expense
of
going
into
court
might
be
avoided
at
first
eglinton
refused
any
meeting
and
insisted
upon
prosecuting
his
full
right
to
the
whole
of
the
property
but
he
deferred
the
meeting
for
a
fortnight
proceedings
being
by
mutual
agreement
suspended
during
that
period
in
the
meanwhile
lester
vane
was
a
constant
guest
at
residence
he
came
early
in
the
morning
and
seldom
left
until
he
could
with
decency
no
longer
stay
as
vane
was
the
guest
of
his
father
mark
could
not
interfere
but
he
gave
that
guest
very
little
of
his
society
notwithstanding
the
latter
exerted
himself
with
all
his
cunning
to
establish
himself
on
a
better
footing
with
him
nor
did
his
conduct
to
flora
his
quiet
hints
in
favour
of
vivian
his
deference
to
her
wish
and
his
careful
abstinence
from
even
a
show
of
to
her
advance
him
in
her
good
opinion
while
strange
enough
old
wilton
began
to
tire
of
him
he
was
so
enwrapt
in
the
disputed
claims
to
the
property
he
had
so
fully
believed
to
be
his
that
it
became
irksome
to
him
to
have
to
keep
up
a
conversation
with
vane
on
subjects
which
possessed
no
kind
of
interest
for
him
one
sunny
morning
as
vane
was
seated
with
mr
wilton
in
his
library
the
servant
of
the
latter
brought
in
two
cards
upon
a
silver
salver
and
handed
them
to
him
he
looked
at
them
and
with
a
sudden
flush
mounting
to
his
cheeks
said
them
two
gentlemen
immediately
afterwards
entered
the
room
and
lester
vane
rose
to
bow
to
them
as
he
heard
wilton
say
riversdale
vivian
the
honorable
lester
lester
almost
fell
back
in
his
seat
not
that
he
cared
to
meet
hal
but
he
had
an
instinctive
dread
of
encountering
hugh
riversdale
the
latter
had
bidden
him
beware
of
their
third
encounter
it
had
now
come
to
pass
what
would
be
its
result
he
clenched
his
hands
firmly
and
set
his
teeth
together
but
sought
to
make
his
face
wear
a
cold
passionless
expression
wilton
motioned
to
his
visitors
to
be
seated
the
eyes
of
both
fell
glittering
upon
lester
vane
but
they
made
no
remark
they
took
their
seats
and
wilton
asked
to
what
he
had
the
honour
of
attributing
the
visit
of
riversdale
he
added
with
a
somewhat
gracious
manner
rather
anticipated
the
pleasure
of
seeing
vivian
before
this
i
should
have
called
upon
or
written
to
him
but
i
had
not
his
new
vivian
bowed
but
made
no
reply
wilton
said
riversdale
are
well
acquainted
as
a
matter
of
course
with
the
unhappy
circumstances
connected
with
family
i
need
not
therefore
allude
to
them
i
have
sought
you
sir
with
a
twofold
purpose
firstly
to
inform
you
that
as
the
husband
of
the
late
eldest
daughter
i
have
taken
upon
myself
the
task
of
arranging
her
affairs
i
am
aware
that
all
his
property
is
deeply
mortgaged
and
that
he
was
largely
indebted
to
a
gentleman
named
gomer
who
still
holds
in
possession
the
next
house
and
all
it
contains
gomer
is
i
believe
the
mortgagee
and
i
wish
to
ask
a
favour
of
at
this
instant
lester
vane
rose
to
leave
the
room
as
though
the
business
being
evidently
private
it
became
him
not
to
remain
and
listen
hugh
riversdale
rose
up
too
and
with
a
stern
look
and
voice
said
seated
sir
you
are
one
of
the
objects
of
my
visit
here
and
i
can
not
permit
you
to
depart
until
i
have
stated
lester
vane
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
reseated
himself
with
an
air
of
that
he
was
far
from
feeling
what
was
coming
hugh
riversdale
continued
speaking
to
wilton
am
given
to
understand
sir
that
you
possess
considerable
influence
with
gomer
he
said
i
am
here
to
ask
you
to
bury
whatever
feeling
of
animosity
you
may
have
entertained
for
the
deceased
grahame
and
to
prevail
upon
gomer
to
meet
me
with
a
view
of
so
arranging
his
claim
that
something
may
be
rescued
out
of
the
wreck
for
his
son
and
for
his
youngest
daughter
evangeline
in
granting
me
this
favour
you
will
be
exhibiting
that
nobleness
of
spirit
and
disposition
which
distinguishes
a
christian
gentleman
and
which
i
on
good
authority
believe
finds
a
home
in
your
wilton
gave
a
gulp
the
want
of
nobleness
of
spirit
had
lost
him
the
friendship
and
countenance
of
gomer
clearing
his
throat
he
said
sympathise
most
deeply
with
the
misfortunes
of
family
unhappily
between
us
both
a
deadly
feud
existed
and
grahame
fell
in
the
struggle
if
i
can
in
any
way
repair
or
alleviate
the
evil
which
has
fallen
like
a
destroying
thunderbolt
upon
his
house
command
me
but
i
grieve
to
say
i
now
possess
no
influence
over
gomer
if
i
ever
did
in
truth
i
a
there
is
a
difference
between
us
just
now
and
we
do
not
meet
i
am
sorry
therefore
i
can
not
help
you
in
the
quarter
you
wish
in
any
other
i
shall
only
be
too
hugh
riversdale
thanked
him
warmly
and
said
may
yet
require
your
services
and
i
shall
avail
myself
of
them
without
favour
added
wilton
making
a
suitable
acknowledgment
hugh
then
fixed
upon
lester
vane
a
fierce
glance
of
hatred
and
addressing
wilton
while
he
pointed
to
the
former
said
now
sir
come
to
the
second
purpose
of
my
visit
it
identifies
itself
with
that
person
seated
by
your
wilton
turned
with
surprise
and
looked
first
at
vane
and
then
at
riversdale
the
face
of
lester
vane
was
blanched
otherwise
it
exhibited
no
emotion
whatever
a
slight
smile
of
defiance
only
curled
his
upper
lip
is
a
suitor
for
your
hand
and
under
your
promise
of
its
bestowal
upon
him
commenced
hugh
wilton
with
elevated
eyebrows
assented
he
is
the
son
of
a
lord
granted
but
it
is
fit
you
should
know
that
his
father
has
for
years
lived
am
aware
of
that
exclaimed
wilton
sharply
you
also
aware
that
it
is
because
he
can
not
show
his
face
to
his
creditors
here
in
england
are
you
aware
that
your
intended
is
worse
than
a
beggar
that
he
is
far
beyond
his
depth
in
debt
that
he
has
already
raised
money
upon
your
expected
dowry
lester
face
grew
whiter
and
his
lips
trembled
hugh
keeping
his
bright
eye
fastened
upon
him
went
on
you
conscious
wilton
that
the
honorable
lester
vane
is
a
blackleg
a
sharper
with
cards
and
false
dice
a
debauchee
a
scoundrel
who
while
he
was
professing
the
warmest
attachment
to
miss
wilton
strove
by
the
most
infamous
proposals
to
ruin
the
daughter
of
the
man
at
whose
house
he
had
been
received
with
cordial
hospitality
that
he
is
a
wretch
so
contemptible
that
words
fail
to
express
his
true
character
are
you
aware
sir
that
such
is
the
man
you
have
honoured
with
a
place
beneath
your
roof
and
to
whom
you
are
eager
to
entrust
the
future
happiness
of
your
child
wilton
placed
his
hands
to
his
forehead
bewildered
he
turned
to
lester
and
in
a
choking
gasping
voice
he
said
what
have
you
to
answer
to
these
tremendous
charges
they
are
from
first
to
last
false
answered
vane
striving
by
a
mighty
effort
to
retain
a
cool
abominably
maliciously
false
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
wilton
some
time
long
before
i
saw
your
sweet
daughter
the
lady
now
the
wife
of
that
fellow
betrayed
a
preference
for
me
which
is
the
secret
dare
to
breathe
one
word
respecting
that
lady
through
your
foul
lips
and
notwithstanding
presence
i
will
fling
you
through
yon
window
down
to
the
place
vaunting
braggadocio
returned
vane
with
a
tremendous
effort
to
appear
cool
wilton
i
shall
commence
an
action
of
libel
against
this
infernal
slanderer
that
will
be
my
best
answer
to
his
there
should
be
some
proofs
adduced
to
support
such
terrible
charges
observed
wilton
to
hugh
riversdale
who
was
labouring
under
the
most
painful
excitement
am
prepared
to
substantiate
many
of
them
by
the
very
clearest
evidence
exclaimed
hal
producing
a
small
packet
of
papers
disinterested
witness
truly
exclaimed
vane
forcing
a
laugh
concocted
scheme
as
you
may
perceive
wilton
surely
you
are
not
prepared
to
condemn
me
upon
such
an
infamous
machination
as
this
the
door
at
this
moment
opened
and
nathan
gomer
entered
followed
by
a
sturdy
looking
man
he
pointed
to
lester
vane
is
your
man
officer
he
exclaimed
lester
vane
uttered
an
exclamation
of
fright
he
darted
from
his
chair
and
made
for
the
open
window
the
height
was
something
but
he
paused
not
to
think
of
it
and
leaped
out
to
the
ground
below
you
shall
not
thus
escape
my
rightful
vengeance
shouted
hugh
riversdale
and
dashed
after
him
the
officer
however
sprang
upon
him
and
seizing
him
by
the
collar
detained
him
sir
he
cried
is
a
man
below
to
prevent
his
escape
besides
he
must
have
broken
his
limbs
if
he
has
not
his
gomer
stood
watching
excitedly
the
movements
of
vane
and
hugh
at
the
elbow
of
wilton
the
latter
with
a
sudden
faintness
clutched
at
arm
me
or
i
shall
swoon
he
exclaimed
said
gomer
brusquely
he
pushed
hal
towards
him
adding
is
the
proper
wilton
almost
insensible
sank
on
to
the
breast
of
harry
vivian
chapter
events
cast
their
shadows
if
this
austere
unsociable
life
change
not
your
offer
made
in
heat
of
blood
if
frosts
and
fasts
hard
lodging
and
thin
weeds
nip
not
the
gaudy
blossoms
of
your
love
but
that
it
bears
this
trial
and
last
love
then
at
the
expiration
of
the
year
come
challenge
me
shakspere
the
deadly
faintness
which
had
overcome
old
wilton
when
he
fell
into
the
arms
of
harry
vivian
increased
until
it
deprived
him
of
all
consciousness
of
what
was
passing
around
him
alarmed
by
an
unusual
disturbance
in
the
house
both
mark
and
flora
hastened
to
the
library
in
time
to
witness
a
scene
to
them
incomprehensible
riversdale
was
struggling
in
the
arms
of
an
officer
nathan
gomer
was
as
usual
unexpectedly
present
giving
instructions
to
a
servant
lester
vane
had
disappeared
and
oh
strangest
sight
of
all
their
father
was
leaning
on
the
breast
of
hal
vivian
yet
an
instant
and
the
whole
scene
was
changed
as
at
the
stroke
of
a
wand
riversdale
officer
nathan
gomer
and
the
servant
had
disappeared
from
the
room
at
one
moment
and
hal
vivian
was
alone
left
to
explain
both
hurriedly
inquired
of
him
what
had
happened
but
he
tenderly
placed
old
wilton
in
his
library
chair
and
begged
for
some
restoratives
on
the
instant
for
it
was
painfully
apparent
that
the
old
man
was
in
a
swoon
flora
hastened
to
obtain
them
while
mark
in
compliance
with
suggestions
rapidly
made
by
hal
descended
to
the
garden
upon
return
she
assisted
by
vivian
applied
some
ammoniacal
salts
to
her
nostrils
and
bathed
his
temples
with
and
water
in
a
short
time
the
application
proved
successful
wilton
recovered
sufficiently
to
gaze
vacantly
around
him
and
utter
a
few
incoherent
remarks
flora
twined
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
with
fond
words
and
soothing
tenderness
succeeded
in
calming
down
the
violent
perturbation
which
succeeded
the
recovery
from
his
swoon
then
he
gazed
almost
wildly
round
him
in
search
of
the
actors
in
the
scene
which
had
perfectly
electrified
and
overwhelmed
him
they
were
gone
the
old
man
gave
an
involuntary
groan
accompanied
by
a
sudden
shudder
then
he
asked
is
nathan
gomer
has
just
quitted
the
library
to
seek
an
interview
with
him
replied
flora
will
return
with
him
i
have
no
no
said
wilton
soliloquizing
will
come
back
no
more
no
more
from
afar
he
will
contemplate
the
destruction
of
hopes
he
assisted
to
raise
only
the
more
completely
to
hurl
them
to
the
sir
exclaimed
flora
softly
have
been
startled
and
shocked
by
what
has
happened
gomer
though
strange
in
his
manner
is
at
heart
generous
and
noble
you
wrong
him
if
you
imagine
he
entertains
any
hostile
feelings
towards
can
you
tell
inquired
her
father
sharply
know
not
who
he
is
you
can
not
more
than
myself
even
conjecture
what
influences
have
animated
him
in
appearing
as
my
friend
and
acting
as
as
he
really
could
not
get
his
lips
to
shape
the
word
still
as
your
friend
i
hope
and
believe
observed
vivian
as
the
old
man
paused
wilton
turned
quickly
and
gazed
upon
him
with
an
air
of
surprise
he
had
not
yet
collected
his
scattered
memories
are
you
here
sir
he
asked
with
knitted
brow
papa
ejaculated
flora
with
an
appealing
aspect
for
she
was
grieved
at
the
harshness
of
his
tone
of
voice
and
the
sternness
of
his
manner
she
remembered
how
much
both
were
indebted
to
vivian
said
her
father
brusquely
you
so
soon
forgotten
the
object
of
the
visit
of
riversdale
and
myself
interrogated
vivian
gently
old
wilton
placed
his
hands
on
his
brow
and
reflected
i
remember
now
he
exclaimed
sarcastically
came
hither
to
oust
a
he
looked
around
the
library
i
presume
you
have
succeeded
to
your
to
yours
i
hope
sir
responded
hal
calmly
mine
oh
of
course
to
mine
to
be
sure
to
mine
and
my
you
forgot
her
did
you
not
vivian
he
asked
with
a
sneer
sir
replied
hal
emphatically
wilton
was
my
first
consideration
in
performing
the
duty
i
to
be
sure
i
had
forgotten
that
said
the
old
man
in
the
same
jibing
tone
ought
to
remember
that
you
were
not
wholly
disinterested
in
the
part
you
have
exclaimed
vivian
with
dignity
would
only
do
me
justice
if
you
were
to
charge
me
with
being
deeply
interested
in
what
i
have
performed
but
at
the
same
time
i
hope
you
will
acquit
me
of
being
selfishly
so
i
hold
the
happiness
of
miss
wilton
and
the
honour
of
yourself
and
house
at
too
high
a
value
to
permit
it
to
be
shattered
and
degraded
by
so
debased
and
so
unworthy
a
scoundrel
as
the
person
who
guarded
by
officers
has
so
recently
been
conveyed
hence
but
do
not
misunderstand
me
sir
i
build
up
no
claim
to
your
consideration
in
what
i
have
done
i
ask
for
no
acknowledgment
or
elevation
to
your
favour
in
saving
yourself
and
daughter
from
the
machinations
of
an
infamous
schemer
your
i
will
accept
only
when
it
is
the
offspring
of
your
free
inclination
i
have
not
sought
nor
would
i
ever
seek
to
purchase
it
at
any
other
price
i
love
miss
wilton
sir
i
candidly
admit
devotedly
love
her
and
shall
do
so
while
i
have
life
but
i
never
have
i
never
desired
and
never
would
attempt
to
crawl
by
stealth
or
by
any
secret
or
unworthy
agency
into
an
alliance
with
her
i
hold
her
in
too
high
respect
and
possess
sir
a
too
consciousness
of
what
is
due
to
my
own
honour
to
be
guilty
of
acts
which
bring
their
own
punishment
with
them
your
unprincipled
friend
colonel
mires
did
not
scruple
while
charging
me
with
a
basely
underhand
attempt
to
win
your
affections
to
arrange
and
carry
almost
to
fulfilment
a
devilish
scheme
which
if
successful
would
while
it
utterly
destroyed
the
happiness
of
your
child
have
ruined
the
plans
you
had
formed
and
looked
forward
to
complete
then
he
whom
you
had
selected
for
the
distinguished
honour
and
inestimable
happiness
of
receiving
your
hand
is
a
worthless
depraved
and
penniless
swindler
sir
at
least
the
very
strictest
and
closest
scrutiny
into
my
nature
and
habits
will
absolve
me
from
being
capable
of
the
baseness
of
the
one
or
guilty
of
the
depravity
of
the
other
it
has
been
my
great
good
fortune
to
rescue
you
in
both
instances
on
the
one
hand
from
the
agony
of
a
shameful
bereavement
on
the
other
from
an
awakening
to
a
knowledge
of
the
infamy
brought
upon
your
name
and
the
misery
entailed
upon
your
daughter
by
an
alliance
which
henceforward
the
thought
of
having
ever
desired
to
contract
will
make
your
cheek
burn
with
vexed
mortification
in
having
performed
this
office
i
hope
to
be
understood
as
not
having
been
influenced
by
one
selfish
thought
but
animated
only
by
a
desire
to
guard
and
protect
miss
wilton
from
dangers
she
could
scarcely
avert
from
herself
and
your
name
from
the
obloquy
which
would
have
fallen
upon
it
in
achieving
this
i
have
been
most
importantly
aided
by
nathan
gomer
and
to
him
your
acknowledgments
are
due
for
the
share
he
has
taken
in
obtaining
success
for
myself
as
i
have
said
i
ignore
them
and
when
i
come
forward
as
i
hope
at
no
distant
day
to
do
and
ask
of
you
your
consent
to
sanction
my
union
with
your
daughter
i
trust
sir
you
will
then
do
me
the
justice
to
admit
that
while
in
respect
to
income
i
am
not
unjustified
in
preferring
a
claim
that
i
have
not
resorted
at
any
time
or
under
any
influences
to
surreptitiously
obtain
that
which
you
are
free
to
give
or
to
you
admit
that
exclaimed
wilton
who
had
listened
attentively
to
all
that
fell
from
his
lips
and
caught
at
the
last
expression
can
conscientiously
acquit
myself
of
having
at
any
time
attempted
to
subvert
that
right
returned
vivian
old
wilton
drew
along
breath
and
then
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
in
which
attitude
he
sat
for
a
few
minutes
evidently
plunged
in
a
profound
reverie
both
flora
and
hal
watched
him
attentively
and
anxiously
at
length
he
raised
his
head
and
addressing
hal
he
said
can
not
conceal
from
myself
that
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
my
life
i
am
equally
conscious
that
i
must
look
upon
you
as
the
saviour
of
my
life
and
honour
they
are
heavy
debts
and
very
difficult
to
me
acknowledgments
i
beg
of
you
interrupted
hal
a
little
impetuously
have
told
you
sir
already
that
i
neither
desire
nor
claim
them
and
i
most
earnestly
assure
you
that
the
only
reward
i
looked
for
i
have
reaped
my
grateful
satisfaction
at
having
been
i
feel
that
i
owe
to
you
something
continued
wilton
in
one
way
i
can
do
a
little
towards
confessing
my
obligation
to
you
and
that
is
by
being
candid
with
you
the
world
is
full
of
disappointments
the
sun
resting
on
a
valley
field
makes
it
appear
a
rich
expanse
of
golden
grain
but
when
we
reach
it
we
find
it
a
poor
piece
of
grass
land
thin
weedy
and
worthless
of
such
are
some
of
our
glowing
expectations
they
burn
brightly
in
the
eye
of
hope
but
like
a
brilliant
flame
consuming
a
flimsy
material
realise
nothing
but
ashes
i
have
had
great
hopes
high
dreams
and
proud
anticipations
they
have
become
nothing
but
dust
now
vivian
in
the
position
in
which
i
have
been
and
am
living
it
is
but
natural
in
suing
for
my
hand
you
should
expect
with
her
at
least
a
moderate
fortune
she
would
have
had
a
liberal
dowry
but
that
expectations
i
have
entertained
will
to
an
almost
inevitable
certainty
not
be
realised
she
will
therefore
have
nothing
from
me
upon
her
marriage
not
a
shilling
while
she
remains
with
me
of
course
she
will
share
the
comforts
of
the
luxurious
style
in
which
we
now
live
but
if
she
quits
for
a
humbler
position
she
must
accept
its
trials
and
its
troubles
for
no
aid
must
she
or
her
husband
expect
from
me
one
moment
vivian
he
exclaimed
as
hal
was
about
eagerly
to
offer
some
observation
moment
more
i
am
informed
your
son
has
returned
from
abroad
and
has
taken
possession
of
everything
no
will
having
been
found
to
the
utter
destruction
of
all
the
expectations
you
entertained
of
succeeding
to
his
business
and
property
is
this
true
is
quite
true
replied
hal
firmly
have
then
to
depend
alone
upon
your
own
exertions
for
the
future
continued
wilton
so
responded
hal
far
then
does
the
disinterested
character
of
your
love
for
my
daughter
extend
inquired
wilton
fixing
a
steadfast
look
upon
him
far
sir
that
as
she
in
all
her
sweet
and
pure
integrity
is
the
only
prize
i
covet
i
shall
be
infinitely
prouder
and
happier
in
taking
her
to
my
heart
as
my
own
beloved
wife
dowerless
than
did
she
have
the
settlement
of
a
how
gratefully
and
fondly
eyes
beamed
on
animated
face
as
he
with
enthusiastic
emphasis
uttered
those
words
i
can
well
believe
said
wilton
dryly
romance
of
youth
is
capable
of
all
that
but
vivian
can
you
transplant
her
to
such
a
home
as
this
or
harleydale
can
you
provide
her
with
a
town
house
and
a
carriage
with
a
country
mansion
with
its
garden
spacious
parks
surrounded
by
upland
and
dell
by
sloping
vales
meandering
streams
by
all
the
charming
accessories
and
beauties
of
english
landscape
are
you
i
say
prepared
to
do
this
flora
stole
to
her
side
and
placing
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
gently
said
with
a
face
of
rosy
hue
dearest
to
me
all
those
beauties
would
be
as
nothing
if
not
shared
by
one
i
by
by
those
i
to
whom
i
am
attached
her
face
brilliant
with
blushes
sank
upon
his
shoulder
wilton
waved
his
hand
proposition
was
to
vivian
and
not
to
you
he
exclaimed
me
can
not
sir
now
do
this
replied
hal
firmly
how
sir
can
you
call
your
love
for
my
daughter
other
than
selfish
cried
wilton
with
apparent
triumph
of
your
exaggerated
liking
for
her
you
would
remove
her
from
a
sphere
in
which
she
enjoys
all
the
luxuries
of
comparative
wealth
into
one
in
which
they
are
all
denied
to
her
you
would
transplant
her
from
competence
and
ease
to
surround
her
with
wants
privations
and
care
this
is
disinterested
love
indeed
to
sacrifice
the
everyday
peace
and
comfort
of
the
woman
for
whom
you
profess
attachment
in
order
that
you
may
call
her
your
own
go
to
sir
true
love
seeks
to
secure
the
entire
happiness
of
the
object
of
affection
it
sacrifices
its
own
wishes
and
aspirations
rather
than
a
cloud
should
hang
upon
the
loved
brow
a
tear
dim
her
eye
or
the
smile
fade
from
her
cheek
it
elevates
sir
never
seeks
to
reduce
her
chances
of
happiness
and
rather
frets
itself
out
in
silence
and
secrecy
than
it
would
by
the
gratification
of
its
inclinations
jeopardise
her
future
peace
and
admit
sir
replied
hal
force
of
your
argument
but
i
deny
the
truth
of
its
intended
conclusion
i
yield
to
no
being
in
the
world
in
the
disinterestedness
of
my
passion
for
miss
wilton
i
would
sacrifice
my
love
and
myself
a
thousand
times
rather
than
occasion
her
one
care
or
privation
it
is
not
sir
because
i
can
not
at
first
place
her
in
the
sphere
she
now
so
fairly
and
brightly
adorns
that
i
must
necessarily
conduct
her
to
a
hovel
in
a
something
is
due
to
my
own
sense
of
her
worth
and
my
own
pride
in
preparing
for
her
if
i
were
to
be
so
blessed
as
to
call
her
mine
a
home
as
fitting
to
her
beauty
and
goodness
as
to
the
station
she
quitted
to
pass
her
life
with
me
i
should
indeed
be
wanting
in
true
love
if
i
did
not
endeavour
to
make
the
change
as
slight
as
indomitable
perseverance
and
unflagging
industry
could
accomplish
i
agree
sir
that
true
love
seeks
to
elevate
the
being
it
worships
but
requited
love
will
make
a
palace
of
a
prison
and
gild
the
roof
of
a
humble
cottage
as
though
it
were
the
fretted
ceiling
of
a
palace
love
sees
through
eyes
and
with
urgings
and
it
seldom
finds
room
for
discontent
if
the
heart
it
prizes
remains
true
faithful
and
devoted
to
it
the
great
secret
of
a
loving
happiness
sir
consists
not
in
the
halls
she
treads
the
terraced
she
may
pace
the
high
sphere
in
which
she
may
have
been
born
and
lived
the
accessories
of
wealth
its
gaieties
or
its
pleasures
it
is
the
discovery
that
the
idol
she
was
first
induced
to
worship
is
not
molten
brass
but
the
pure
gold
for
which
she
first
accepted
it
that
her
trusting
faith
has
not
been
abused
that
the
ardent
manner
of
him
who
won
her
heart
has
not
waned
that
the
beaming
look
of
fond
affection
remains
unchanged
that
the
soft
word
has
not
grown
harsh
and
that
the
solicitude
for
her
happiness
remains
as
intact
as
when
it
first
moved
her
gentle
heart
to
respond
to
its
generous
tenderness
that
loving
trusting
heart
that
you
would
chain
to
its
own
sphere
would
pine
itself
into
the
grave
if
upon
such
a
plea
it
were
confined
to
its
halls
its
gardens
parks
and
extended
landscape
but
believe
me
it
would
not
grieve
if
its
lot
though
cast
in
a
lower
sphere
rested
on
a
manly
faithful
truthful
nature
which
never
swerved
from
the
deep
and
passionate
affection
it
once
professed
however
sir
at
best
we
are
but
theorizing
i
am
content
to
abide
the
issue
i
will
not
i
pledge
my
honour
my
dearest
possession
ask
your
permission
to
woo
miss
wilton
until
i
am
fairly
in
a
social
position
which
will
give
me
some
title
to
do
so
further
sir
if
it
be
your
wish
great
as
may
be
the
pain
and
privation
to
me
i
will
not
attempt
to
visit
or
to
see
or
to
speak
with
her
in
any
manner
which
may
infringe
upon
the
relation
in
which
we
now
stand
to
each
other
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
acquaintances
i
will
not
if
unprepared
to
urge
my
own
claim
interfere
with
any
offer
which
may
be
made
for
the
honour
of
miss
hand
if
that
offer
is
in
accordance
with
your
wishes
and
not
opposed
to
her
future
happiness
more
i
scarcely
expect
you
will
wish
me
to
say
less
sir
i
feel
would
be
inconsistent
with
my
own
sense
of
what
is
just
and
wilton
extended
his
hand
to
hal
saying
have
spoken
frankly
and
and
a
i
may
as
well
say
it
as
think
it
nobly
vivian
i
am
well
satisfied
and
fully
appreciate
those
sentiments
which
you
have
just
uttered
and
which
i
shall
test
i
honestly
tell
you
the
result
is
for
the
future
take
at
present
your
farewell
of
flora
when
we
next
meet
it
will
be
as
friends
heaven
shall
decide
whether
it
will
be
by
a
nearer
and
dearer
hal
shook
the
extended
hand
warmly
will
not
abuse
any
confidence
you
may
be
pleased
to
place
in
me
sir
he
replied
i
too
honestly
tell
you
that
it
will
be
the
object
of
my
most
incessant
perseverance
and
ardent
ambition
to
change
the
title
of
friend
into
one
nearer
and
hal
walked
up
to
flora
she
was
not
contented
with
giving
him
one
hand
but
she
placed
both
in
his
and
she
looked
up
in
his
face
with
trusting
confidence
and
a
sweet
loving
expression
in
her
eyes
a
beaming
aspect
of
hopefulness
shone
in
her
very
lovely
features
which
communicated
its
cheerful
sanguine
anticipations
to
hal
shall
go
hard
dear
flora
but
i
win
the
wealth
which
shall
make
you
mine
he
ejaculated
in
fervent
tones
gilds
the
humble
roof
dear
hal
she
murmured
anywhere
in
the
wide
world
with
your
unfading
faithful
undying
ever
ever
faithful
love
he
responded
my
undying
ever
ever
faithful
love
she
echoed
as
she
pressed
his
hand
making
him
thrill
with
happiness
and
so
they
parted
the
ice
about
heart
in
respect
to
their
union
had
begun
to
crack
he
gazed
upon
them
very
intently
while
they
were
conversing
together
and
he
thought
them
certainly
a
very
handsome
young
couple
and
if
personal
attributes
alone
were
needful
a
more
fitting
match
could
hardly
be
conceived
soon
after
hal
had
quitted
the
house
mark
wilton
returned
to
the
library
to
furnish
his
father
with
a
brief
narrative
of
what
had
taken
place
without
the
house
as
well
as
in
it
relative
to
the
honorable
lester
vane
the
miserable
affrighted
leap
had
been
attended
with
desperate
results
fractured
legs
and
arms
attested
the
fearful
violence
with
which
he
came
to
the
ground
and
he
was
conveyed
as
soon
as
he
was
picked
up
senseless
to
the
nearest
hospital
still
in
custody
of
an
officer
he
was
the
mortgagor
of
an
estate
to
nathan
gomer
which
had
been
already
twice
mortgaged
to
more
than
its
value
the
he
handed
over
were
fresh
ones
he
had
had
copied
from
the
original
draft
and
were
therefore
fraudulent
the
sight
of
nathan
gomer
with
an
officer
at
his
elbow
revealed
to
him
the
discovery
that
had
been
made
and
in
his
intense
alarm
he
leaped
out
of
the
window
in
the
hope
of
escape
but
only
to
succeed
in
making
himself
a
maimed
cripple
for
life
no
one
would
desire
to
a
butterfly
on
a
wheel
and
by
this
event
hugh
riversdale
considered
his
wife
helen
avenged
mark
introduced
nathan
gomer
to
hugh
and
they
together
left
house
for
the
residence
of
the
deceased
grahame
wilton
listened
to
the
account
of
lester
iniquity
and
to
his
terrible
accident
with
a
chastened
called
flora
to
him
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
have
wronged
you
my
darling
he
said
with
emotion
have
been
bitterly
punished
well
well
we
will
see
if
we
can
not
reward
you
with
a
young
handsome
fellow
you
would
like
better
well
well
we
shall
see
how
he
behaves
dear
father
murmured
flora
her
eyes
glistening
with
happiness
at
his
words
old
wilton
gazed
fondly
on
her
face
upturned
to
his
a
gleam
of
pride
shot
forth
from
his
eyes
as
he
perused
her
exquisite
features
my
word
he
said
with
a
chuckle
young
fellow
vivian
is
a
cunning
dog
with
excellent
taste
he
might
journey
many
a
weary
mile
ere
he
found
a
prettier
face
than
yours
except
he
added
reflectively
he
were
to
encounter
my
little
pet
nurse
on
his
way
hem
she
had
a
pretty
face
that
kind
young
friend
of
yours
eh
dear
dear
face
responded
flora
warmly
she
turned
to
mark
with
an
expressive
twinkle
in
her
eyes
and
said
think
so
too
you
mark
ejaculated
his
father
with
a
kind
of
depreciatory
grunt
but
a
poor
enough
at
least
cried
mark
rather
hotly
think
the
face
of
your
little
pet
nurse
as
you
call
her
the
brightest
sweetest
pleasantest
the
most
loveable
under
he
looked
fiercely
and
defiantly
both
at
his
sister
and
father
as
though
to
challenge
them
to
disprove
him
if
they
could
flora
smiled
roguishly
at
him
and
wilton
with
evident
satisfaction
for
he
little
dreamed
that
the
subject
of
his
encomium
was
that
very
he
had
so
sternly
objected
to
receive
into
his
family
mark
he
exclaimed
with
a
chuckle
have
more
discrimination
and
taste
than
i
gave
you
credit
for
in
this
matter
you
judge
justly
and
with
a
very
clear
perception
of
the
truth
i
say
that
when
she
comes
before
you
her
face
greets
you
like
a
burst
of
sunshine
it
is
radiant
with
a
galaxy
of
glories
for
it
is
cheerful
amiable
placid
gentle
good
generous
patient
unselfish
everything
in
fact
that
is
estimable
and
can
make
the
female
face
echoed
mark
emphatically
repeated
flora
reflectively
every
one
of
those
beautiful
qualities
i
have
named
beam
in
her
fascinatingly
expressive
face
exclaimed
wilton
in
her
clear
earnest
eyes
said
mark
in
her
eyes
echoed
his
father
in
her
smile
suggested
flora
in
her
smile
repeated
wilton
slightly
elevating
his
voice
chuckled
mark
aha
he
was
on
the
eve
of
making
a
great
disclosure
but
he
restrained
himself
he
however
rubbed
his
hands
briskly
with
intense
gratification
while
wilton
felt
his
resolution
to
carry
out
his
cherished
and
secretly
formed
design
considerably
strengthened
by
the
very
apparent
good
feeling
entertained
by
his
children
towards
the
object
of
his
hidden
purpose
the
pleasure
diffused
by
that
conversation
somewhat
further
extended
seemed
to
compensate
for
the
pain
the
previous
incidents
of
the
morning
had
occasioned
truly
the
little
episode
was
very
agreeable
not
the
less
so
perhaps
because
the
actual
relation
in
which
the
subject
of
it
stood
to
father
and
son
did
not
transpire
a
few
days
subsequently
wilton
was
startled
by
a
note
from
charlock
it
had
reference
to
the
proposed
meeting
between
wilton
and
his
solicitor
and
the
new
claimant
and
his
solicitor
it
stated
that
eglinton
having
ascertained
beyond
a
doubt
the
indisputable
character
of
his
claim
failed
to
see
upon
reflection
any
advantage
in
the
suggested
arrangements
he
therefore
announced
his
intention
of
withdrawing
from
it
and
of
leaving
the
legal
proceedings
to
take
their
legitimate
course
charlock
appended
to
this
communication
from
the
opposite
party
his
own
private
opinion
that
after
a
very
keen
and
subtle
examination
of
the
new
claims
by
a
consultation
of
eminent
counsel
there
was
no
prospect
of
successfully
resisting
them
and
in
the
strict
and
conscientious
performance
of
his
duty
he
advised
to
save
the
enormous
cost
of
going
to
trial
that
wilton
should
abandon
those
he
had
for
years
so
pertinaciously
urged
wilton
perused
this
letter
with
much
dissatisfaction
and
without
at
all
being
convinced
by
its
reasoning
no
man
who
for
years
has
nursed
a
claim
to
property
real
or
fancied
is
ready
to
yield
it
up
on
representations
such
as
charlock
made
to
wilton
if
there
is
one
thing
in
transactions
he
clings
to
with
more
unyielding
tenacity
than
another
it
is
a
claim
at
law
to
property
to
prosecute
his
claim
he
will
suffer
himself
to
be
denuded
of
all
he
possesses
he
will
part
with
everything
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
try
solicitor
after
solicitor
abandon
trade
profession
comparative
independence
exhaust
his
means
yield
up
everything
in
fact
but
his
claim
and
when
after
successive
defeats
all
possibility
of
continuing
the
struggle
longer
is
taken
from
him
he
has
still
faith
in
his
right
still
an
unshaken
belief
that
he
has
not
had
justice
dealt
out
to
him
that
judge
jury
and
lawyers
have
been
feeed
and
have
entered
into
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
him
of
what
is
lawfully
his
old
wilton
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
it
is
true
he
had
a
misgiving
about
this
claim
of
which
he
had
first
heard
from
nathan
gomer
but
that
individual
had
told
him
it
was
one
which
was
never
likely
to
be
preferred
and
he
had
therefore
troubled
himself
no
more
about
it
nathan
gomer
had
spoken
in
very
light
terms
about
it
and
no
doubt
justly
he
began
to
surmise
that
charlock
was
falling
into
his
dotage
when
he
recommended
a
client
to
resign
claims
acknowledged
to
be
most
powerful
to
property
so
large
and
valuable
he
quickly
found
many
reasons
why
he
should
contend
for
the
prize
and
whether
founded
on
sound
conclusions
or
not
he
adopted
them
who
was
this
eglinton
who
had
so
suddenly
appeared
where
had
he
sprung
from
where
hidden
himself
how
could
he
identify
himself
ha
that
was
a
point
of
very
great
importance
had
not
he
wilton
for
years
been
kept
from
the
enjoyment
of
his
property
because
of
the
difficulty
of
proving
that
he
actually
was
the
person
he
represented
himself
to
be
in
such
manner
did
he
argue
the
question
with
himself
and
ultimately
determine
at
any
sacrifice
to
proceed
in
his
suit
even
if
he
had
to
change
his
of
to
accomplish
his
resolve
first
however
he
resolved
upon
a
reconciliation
with
nathan
gomer
he
had
at
best
but
a
hazy
notion
of
the
actual
cause
of
difference
existing
between
them
he
however
felt
that
he
had
himself
been
to
blame
and
from
him
the
ought
to
come
he
determined
that
it
should
but
how
communicate
with
nathan
he
had
already
had
one
letter
written
to
him
returned
unopened
he
was
not
anxious
to
repeat
the
experiment
he
luckily
remembered
that
flora
stood
very
high
in
favour
that
he
had
always
evinced
a
nervous
anxiety
for
her
happiness
and
therefore
it
was
extremely
probable
that
if
she
were
to
address
to
him
a
few
lines
requesting
him
to
come
again
to
visit
the
family
on
the
same
footing
as
of
old
and
convey
a
hint
that
her
father
regretted
any
unconsidered
behaviour
of
his
own
which
had
tended
to
produce
a
rupture
in
the
amiable
relations
in
which
they
had
always
stood
to
each
other
he
would
comply
with
her
solicitation
after
carefully
considering
the
point
over
he
sought
his
daughter
flora
and
conveyed
to
her
his
desire
that
she
should
write
a
note
to
nathan
gomer
inviting
him
to
return
to
his
old
position
in
their
family
wilton
left
to
flora
the
entire
wording
of
the
epistle
he
merely
wished
her
to
express
his
own
desire
to
meet
nathan
again
and
his
regret
that
any
misunderstanding
should
have
occasioned
their
separation
flora
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
result
attending
this
communication
if
she
had
been
it
is
very
probable
that
she
would
have
infused
into
it
all
the
ardour
and
fervour
of
which
her
nature
was
capable
as
it
was
she
had
a
deep
respect
for
the
little
man
and
great
faith
in
his
promise
to
procure
for
her
future
life
as
much
happiness
as
he
might
have
it
in
his
power
to
control
thus
she
composed
her
note
to
nathan
gomer
with
sufficient
eloquence
and
warmth
to
assure
him
that
she
was
solicitous
to
see
him
again
and
he
was
shrewd
enough
to
comprehend
also
anxiety
by
the
medium
he
had
employed
to
convey
his
wishes
in
his
dreary
dull
old
chamber
he
sat
alone
and
pondered
over
note
the
long
night
through
and
the
following
day
she
received
a
short
but
kind
reply
to
tell
her
that
he
yielded
to
her
solicitation
and
he
would
join
them
at
dinner
that
day
he
came
to
his
appointment
his
manner
and
appearance
exhibited
no
apparent
difference
to
what
they
ordinarily
wore
yet
flora
fancied
she
could
detect
an
expression
of
satisfaction
if
not
pleasure
in
his
eyes
an
evidence
that
he
was
no
less
gratified
at
the
reunion
than
all
present
were
when
the
cloth
was
cleared
and
the
servants
had
quitted
the
room
wilton
cleared
his
throat
and
said
a
gomer
a
i
take
an
early
moment
to
say
a
that
with
no
desire
to
intrude
upon
your
time
which
i
a
i
know
to
be
very
valuable
i
a
should
be
most
glad
of
a
little
of
your
counsel
and
experience
on
a
matter
which
very
intimately
and
deeply
a
concerns
my
future
shall
be
very
happy
wilton
to
afford
you
any
advice
or
assistance
replied
nathan
gomer
gravely
before
i
attempt
to
do
so
there
are
two
points
i
think
ought
to
be
settled
first
who
i
really
am
and
by
what
right
i
have
taken
upon
myself
to
interfere
in
your
family
affairs
flora
and
mark
looked
hard
at
each
other
if
ever
here
was
a
question
possessing
a
vivid
interest
to
them
both
this
was
one
secondly
continued
nathan
gomer
i
consider
my
advice
if
worth
asking
for
to
be
worth
following
i
therefore
distinctly
decline
to
give
it
unless
you
having
faith
in
the
deep
concern
i
entertain
for
your
welfare
and
interests
pass
to
me
your
word
of
honour
as
a
gentleman
that
you
will
accept
it
and
carry
it
the
first
was
a
subject
of
eager
curiosity
to
wilton
and
he
was
only
too
glad
that
nathan
had
himself
mooted
it
but
the
second
was
a
poser
suppose
he
should
advise
as
charlock
had
done
a
rapid
retrospective
reflection
however
caused
wilton
to
believe
that
he
might
rely
upon
the
sincerity
of
nathan
counsel
for
he
had
proved
its
truth
and
its
profound
sagacity
so
he
assented
with
a
graceful
manifestation
which
nathan
accepted
at
pretty
much
its
proper
value
then
he
exclaimed
reveal
to
you
who
i
am
and
why
i
therefore
have
taken
upon
myself
to
advance
your
interests
and
ensure
the
happiness
of
yourself
and
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
placed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
wilton
mark
and
flora
regarded
him
with
breathless
attention
for
a
minute
or
so
a
profound
silence
reigned
broken
only
by
the
heavy
inspirations
of
nathan
gomer
chapter
the
flower
of
the
flock
and
from
the
prayer
of
want
and
plaint
of
woe
oh
never
never
turn
away
thine
ear
forlorn
is
this
bleak
wilderness
below
oh
what
were
man
should
heaven
refuse
to
hear
to
others
do
the
law
is
not
severe
what
to
thyself
thou
wishest
to
be
done
armstrong
nathan
gomer
withdrew
his
hands
from
before
his
eyes
a
sharp
spasm
which
had
almost
convulsed
his
frame
had
passed
away
and
he
commenced
his
revelation
he
addressed
himself
to
wilton
rather
than
to
his
other
auditors
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
his
story
possessed
for
the
old
man
a
most
absorbing
interest
was
separated
from
my
family
at
a
very
early
age
he
commenced
taken
under
the
roof
and
tender
care
of
a
sister
of
my
mother
my
father
was
a
wild
dissipated
spendthrift
in
perpetual
pecuniary
difficulties
my
mother
a
gentle
timid
tender
creature
passed
a
life
of
incessant
fright
care
and
distressing
misery
after
her
union
with
him
she
had
been
married
to
him
some
five
years
before
i
was
born
and
at
that
period
she
had
reached
the
very
climax
of
wretchedness
with
the
miserable
man
to
whom
she
was
tied
a
series
of
wild
excesses
drove
him
into
an
infuriated
insanity
during
a
fearful
paroxysm
of
which
life
was
snatched
from
him
in
my
horror
at
this
event
i
was
prematurely
born
my
mother
never
recovered
the
shock
within
two
years
of
my
decease
she
was
placed
in
the
same
grave
and
i
was
taken
charge
of
by
her
sister
boyhood
was
passed
in
comparative
seclusion
for
i
was
from
my
earliest
recollection
possessed
of
personal
defects
and
idle
thoughtless
boys
when
i
appeared
amongst
them
found
a
delight
in
wounding
my
susceptibility
by
jeering
at
me
mocking
my
stunted
growth
and
my
sallow
visage
i
was
on
that
account
kept
as
much
within
doors
as
possible
and
was
educated
at
home
i
had
kind
instructors
and
an
extensive
library
to
consult
and
naturally
acquired
a
passion
for
reading
especially
as
legendary
lore
was
rather
an
extensive
element
in
the
collection
i
was
perhaps
the
more
urged
to
devote
myself
to
books
because
by
comparison
i
became
quite
aware
of
my
physical
deficiencies
and
because
with
a
kind
motive
terrible
example
was
always
held
up
before
me
so
i
became
dull
and
thoughtful
and
shunned
society
as
much
as
it
was
possible
for
me
to
do
and
i
began
to
feel
like
cain
strangers
met
me
with
a
smile
of
derision
or
their
lips
were
curled
with
scorn
i
was
bantered
by
my
own
kind
and
was
the
scoff
of
the
other
sex
no
wonder
that
i
hated
the
human
race
for
it
appeared
to
hate
me
even
the
servants
of
the
house
in
which
i
lived
made
me
the
butt
at
which
to
level
the
shafts
of
their
vulgar
ridicule
how
much
of
this
i
really
deserved
i
do
not
now
pretend
to
measure
but
i
hurled
back
the
contumely
i
received
with
fierce
intemperate
defiance
i
spurned
and
spat
and
sneered
too
even
though
beneath
that
scornful
rage
my
heart
was
breaking
had
nearly
arrived
at
estate
a
dwarf
still
in
stature
harbouring
against
the
world
the
most
rancorous
animosity
when
i
became
sensible
that
there
was
one
gentle
spirit
who
was
out
of
the
pale
of
my
hate
years
before
a
quiet
mild
girl
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
my
and
she
was
often
invited
when
in
an
irritated
turbulent
mood
i
wandered
about
threatening
mischief
to
others
as
to
myself
at
first
i
repelled
her
but
somehow
she
discovered
the
way
to
soften
my
violence
and
to
lead
my
thoughts
into
a
gentler
train
as
we
grew
up
together
her
influence
over
me
increased
until
her
lightest
wish
became
the
law
i
implicitly
obeyed
her
face
and
form
were
of
faultless
beauty
and
her
mind
was
not
less
perfect
in
purity
and
excellence
her
coming
seemed
to
me
as
the
opening
of
the
gates
of
paradise
in
which
i
wandered
with
her
her
going
as
though
i
had
been
thrust
back
into
darkness
and
gloom
in
my
most
morose
fits
her
smiling
eyes
and
soft
words
wooed
me
into
placidity
and
to
kinder
thoughts
of
others
her
gentle
touch
unloosed
my
clenched
hands
unlocked
my
teeth
and
her
appealing
look
toned
down
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
against
those
who
were
as
it
seemed
to
me
lashing
me
into
fury
by
chance
i
learned
that
she
had
been
wooed
and
won
by
a
youth
of
fairer
proportions
than
myself
that
tender
words
of
affection
had
been
poured
into
a
not
unwilling
ear
and
that
she
had
promised
to
give
her
hand
with
her
heart
in
it
to
him
whose
form
and
features
had
pleased
her
eye
and
whose
honied
language
had
beguiled
her
of
her
love
know
not
how
to
describe
the
overwhelming
agony
of
my
heart
at
the
discovery
i
brooded
over
it
nursed
the
most
terrible
schemes
of
vengeance
on
him
who
was
thus
about
to
rob
me
of
the
only
being
who
had
sympathised
with
me
had
reasoned
with
me
and
had
brought
me
back
from
almost
brute
barbarism
into
the
realms
of
a
common
humanity
who
had
extirpated
many
of
my
worst
failings
and
replaced
them
by
implanting
virtues
resembling
her
own
i
took
the
first
opportunity
of
challenging
her
with
the
tale
i
had
heard
and
she
at
once
with
blushing
face
acknowledged
its
truth
then
then
in
frantic
terms
i
confessed
the
idolatry
with
which
i
worshipped
her
then
by
an
involuntary
exclamation
she
revealed
to
me
that
she
had
done
all
for
me
in
commiserating
pity
and
nought
in
love
oh
the
intense
torture
of
that
admission
interview
was
long
and
agonising
to
me
and
scarcely
less
painful
to
her
let
me
not
further
recur
to
it
even
at
this
moment
i
nathan
gomer
abruptly
rose
and
paced
the
room
hiding
his
averted
face
in
his
handkerchief
recovering
himself
by
a
strong
effort
he
returned
to
his
seat
and
continued
abruptly
fled
home
and
the
neighbourhood
i
never
returned
thither
i
came
to
london
where
i
changed
my
name
a
large
legacy
greeted
my
arrival
i
hastened
to
secure
it
and
to
commence
to
increase
it
by
every
art
the
usurer
can
employ
i
hated
my
race
i
knew
no
more
certain
way
of
feeding
on
their
blood
than
by
lending
money
at
usurious
interest
oh
but
i
have
like
a
miserable
wretch
that
i
was
gloated
over
the
fearful
agonies
of
a
breaking
heart
and
in
my
dreary
solitary
chamber
i
have
yelled
with
triumphant
delight
over
the
mad
despair
of
those
i
have
helped
to
destruction
so
years
went
on
gold
showered
on
me
from
all
sides
my
aunt
left
her
sole
wealth
to
me
i
converted
her
lands
into
coin
and
lent
it
out
the
proud
bent
like
fawning
spaniels
at
my
feet
the
humble
knelt
to
me
the
rich
smiled
and
bowed
to
me
the
high
and
the
sought
ugh
i
might
have
surfeited
myself
with
the
society
yellow
ungainly
dwarf
though
i
happened
to
be
night
alone
in
my
dismal
room
gloating
over
the
feat
of
having
that
day
planted
my
foot
on
a
proud
neck
there
suddenly
came
upon
me
the
memory
of
the
past
i
was
a
boy
again
she
whom
i
had
so
loved
in
my
youth
flora
thorneley
stood
before
me
there
in
her
white
girlish
garb
bright
shining
like
a
seraph
her
soft
sad
eyes
bent
upon
me
with
a
pitying
expression
and
her
low
musical
voice
ringing
in
my
ears
hast
broken
thy
promise
she
said
hast
planted
sorrow
where
thou
mightest
have
sown
joy
thou
hast
plunged
into
hopeless
misery
those
whom
thou
mightest
have
lifted
into
happiness
alas
alas
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
alone
and
wilton
with
his
hands
compressed
had
risen
up
as
gomer
uttered
the
name
and
he
repeated
thorneley
she
whom
you
wedded
exclaimed
nathan
with
excitement
she
my
first
love
and
my
last
be
seated
my
story
is
drawing
to
a
wilton
obeyed
but
looked
upon
him
with
a
gaze
in
which
wonder
mystification
and
stupefaction
were
blended
a
suggestion
had
presented
itself
to
him
which
electrified
him
nathan
gomer
went
on
regarded
now
by
flora
and
mark
with
intense
earnestness
went
down
the
following
day
to
harleydale
he
said
there
learned
the
terrible
circumstances
which
had
driven
you
wilton
to
leave
there
i
returned
to
london
and
sought
you
out
but
too
late
to
be
of
the
service
i
intended
i
became
your
landlord
but
not
until
she
whom
i
sought
had
sunk
into
her
grave
when
this
dreadful
blow
smote
me
i
registered
a
vow
that
i
would
strive
to
ensure
the
happiness
of
her
children
i
have
striven
to
fulfil
that
vow
and
i
shall
not
cease
in
my
efforts
until
it
is
accomplished
or
my
powers
to
act
are
stayed
by
the
hand
of
the
then
said
wilton
anxiously
not
nathan
gomer
but
eliott
eglinton
claimant
and
to
those
estates
which
have
been
so
long
in
chancery
which
had
you
been
just
might
have
been
yours
but
now
must
be
mine
you
now
know
wilton
who
i
am
and
why
i
have
spared
neither
time
nor
money
to
restore
you
to
affluence
you
who
beggared
me
of
all
i
valued
in
the
world
you
who
so
well
remembered
my
services
and
so
liberally
rewarded
wilton
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
sank
back
in
his
chair
with
a
groan
flora
stole
to
the
side
of
the
dwarf
and
knelt
to
him
she
pointed
to
her
father
and
then
to
heaven
him
for
sake
she
said
in
trembling
accents
he
pressed
her
hands
and
raised
her
from
her
suppliant
posture
her
dear
sake
he
murmured
is
there
was
a
silence
then
nathan
gomer
said
there
is
something
to
clear
up
wilton
be
a
man
and
attend
to
me
for
the
welfare
of
your
children
is
now
at
stake
i
have
committed
myself
to
the
of
securing
their
earthly
happiness
if
within
the
compass
of
my
power
and
therefore
i
shall
now
proceed
to
renew
the
conversation
which
so
abruptly
parted
us
i
suggested
that
you
should
reward
young
vivian
with
the
hand
of
your
daughter
flora
upon
what
i
consider
to
be
sound
reasons
first
they
love
each
other
that
i
expect
from
past
experience
you
will
admit
is
a
strong
element
in
producing
happiness
in
wedded
life
secondly
vivian
possesses
many
admirable
qualifications
he
is
honourable
generous
and
capable
of
the
most
enduring
attachment
he
is
brave
persevering
industrious
he
is
well
educated
and
in
the
event
of
reverses
can
support
his
family
by
his
remarkable
skill
he
has
been
as
far
as
resources
go
so
fortunate
as
to
discover
the
will
of
harper
which
proved
that
very
respectable
and
good
man
to
have
been
infinitely
richer
than
he
had
the
credit
of
being
the
provisions
of
the
will
leave
a
handsome
stipend
to
the
widow
a
small
income
to
the
son
who
by
the
way
is
on
his
the
results
of
excessive
drinking
and
the
whole
of
the
residue
of
his
wealth
to
henry
vivian
now
wilton
does
your
pride
still
step
in
between
your
daughter
and
her
future
happiness
wilton
held
out
his
hand
to
gomer
have
conquered
me
he
said
vivian
is
prepared
to
come
forward
to
claim
my
hand
i
will
no
longer
withhold
my
am
happy
to
hear
it
exclaimed
nathan
shaking
his
hand
adding
considering
her
narrow
escape
from
frightful
misery
at
the
hands
of
an
atrocious
scoundrel
who
is
likely
henceforth
to
suffer
for
his
misdeeds
i
hardly
expected
you
would
withhold
it
as
for
vivian
we
will
soon
ascertain
his
views
on
the
he
rose
and
rang
the
bell
a
servant
appeared
vivian
arrived
he
inquired
has
this
moment
come
returned
the
servant
him
in
said
nathan
in
another
moment
hal
made
his
appearance
flora
turned
crimson
and
then
pale
and
then
sank
into
a
seat
mark
jumped
up
and
shook
him
heartily
by
the
hand
vivian
exclaimed
nathan
with
a
chuckle
and
a
grin
have
paved
the
way
for
you
and
if
you
still
feel
inclined
to
accept
the
hand
of
miss
flora
wilton
sir
interrupted
hal
almost
sharply
sir
grinned
nathan
for
the
hand
of
miss
wilton
sir
if
you
prefer
that
arrangement
of
expression
and
propose
at
hal
quickly
did
this
in
language
fervid
and
eloquent
and
if
language
could
be
a
test
of
sincerity
there
was
little
reason
for
flora
to
doubt
the
truth
of
his
love
wilton
in
reply
gave
with
nervous
excitement
of
manner
his
consent
leaving
the
ratification
of
his
promise
to
his
daughter
will
refuse
decline
raise
an
obstacle
exclaimed
nathan
vigorously
it
is
only
to
keep
up
the
unities
of
the
we
have
all
been
playing
no
no
no
cried
flora
hurriedly
and
loudly
at
a
burst
of
laughter
from
mark
and
nathan
she
buried
her
blushing
face
in
her
hands
hal
was
suffered
to
remove
them
and
to
press
them
to
his
lips
accept
him
cried
gomer
chuckling
flora
that
is
the
proper
form
of
expression
is
it
not
i
am
so
happy
so
very
very
happy
she
murmured
looking
fondly
at
hal
then
she
suddenly
ran
up
to
her
father
and
kissed
him
as
if
with
passionate
gratitude
presently
she
stole
round
to
where
nathan
gomer
sat
and
bending
over
him
timidly
pressed
her
lips
to
his
forehead
an
expression
of
intense
emotion
passed
over
that
strange
features
his
eyes
filled
with
glittering
tears
and
his
lips
moved
rapidly
a
stillness
he
rose
up
and
took
hand
he
placed
it
in
and
with
a
voice
whose
tones
became
rich
from
depth
of
feeling
he
said
her
vivian
you
are
the
choice
of
her
young
heart
as
she
is
of
yours
your
future
happiness
is
in
the
keeping
of
both
be
you
faithful
to
the
trust
now
reposed
in
you
be
you
true
to
the
love
you
now
bear
her
you
have
won
her
now
wear
her
as
the
richest
jewel
heaven
and
fortune
can
bestow
upon
you
be
gentle
to
her
and
tender
with
her
for
she
is
a
flower
that
will
droop
and
perish
under
a
cold
aspect
and
be
sure
that
for
all
the
loving
tenderness
you
may
plant
around
her
coming
life
you
will
reap
an
abundant
harvest
of
pure
enduring
devoted
that
i
were
worthy
of
this
treasure
so
great
so
sacred
now
entrusted
to
my
keeping
ejaculated
hal
in
a
quivering
ardent
voice
as
he
drew
flora
to
his
breast
only
faith
in
me
i
would
die
rather
than
be
the
occasion
of
one
sad
thought
to
responded
nathan
gomer
me
young
vivian
though
i
help
to
hand
over
this
treasure
to
you
i
do
not
resign
my
guardianship
oh
but
i
shall
be
a
very
dragon
of
watchfulness
a
merry
laugh
followed
this
sally
then
everybody
seemed
to
know
what
was
coming
next
face
grew
serious
and
its
muscles
set
he
had
made
one
sacrifice
somehow
he
continued
to
think
so
he
felt
really
that
he
ought
to
be
excused
from
making
another
certainly
they
were
not
small
ones
however
nathan
gomer
set
boldly
to
work
and
introduced
the
subject
by
addressing
mark
sir
having
been
a
witness
to
your
happiness
in
catching
a
husband
have
you
no
yearnings
to
take
unto
yourself
a
wife
have
for
some
time
had
the
most
ardent
desire
sir
responded
mark
quickly
have
selected
a
young
lady
but
my
father
objects
to
my
what
ground
wilton
inquired
nathan
rather
magisterially
wilton
declined
discussing
the
topic
wished
it
to
be
deferred
to
a
future
period
but
nathan
would
on
no
account
accede
to
it
came
here
to
perfect
my
reconciliation
and
to
leave
if
possible
a
happy
man
and
i
am
not
in
a
temper
to
be
easily
rebuffed
he
said
your
reasons
wilton
knew
but
little
of
the
girl
he
said
but
that
she
was
not
of
a
station
or
by
birth
fitted
to
be
the
wife
of
his
son
gomer
scouted
the
notion
and
shame
from
no
condition
rise
he
exclaimed
says
the
poet
surely
no
man
better
than
you
should
know
it
wilton
and
by
the
bye
if
you
and
i
were
to
trace
our
ancestors
back
we
should
no
doubt
find
one
a
and
the
other
a
delver
of
potatoes
come
wilton
supposing
her
origin
which
i
assume
you
are
in
no
condition
to
prove
is
what
you
assert
it
to
be
mean
and
low
what
have
you
to
assert
further
against
her
she
is
pretty
amiable
generous
and
sympathetic
to
a
fault
she
is
pure
in
mind
in
soul
and
act
she
has
struggled
through
the
stern
meshes
of
adversity
with
a
brave
heart
she
has
never
sacrificed
her
sense
of
self
respect
under
the
most
seductive
temptation
and
she
never
drew
back
from
an
additional
burden
to
her
daily
trials
if
she
could
in
so
doing
rescue
from
misery
a
what
wilton
though
she
has
toiled
and
nobly
toiled
with
her
needle
have
you
not
slaved
with
your
burnisher
come
wilton
pride
is
but
a
hollow
phantom
a
bad
companion
and
a
worse
friend
it
never
purchased
human
happiness
yet
human
worth
is
far
more
valuable
than
all
the
wealth
of
the
indies
amassed
in
one
heap
this
girl
has
a
large
share
of
that
worth
and
would
make
your
son
a
happy
man
if
not
a
rich
one
what
say
you
sir
that
no
praise
can
exaggerate
her
merits
replied
hal
with
enthusiasm
my
beloved
flora
for
my
wife
and
lotte
clinton
for
my
sister
there
would
be
no
man
more
justly
proud
than
i
in
all
should
think
not
replied
gomer
wilton
coughed
me
time
he
said
me
time
i
will
see
her
i
know
nothing
of
her
he
wants
more
evidence
cried
gomer
ringing
the
bell
with
smartness
shall
have
a
servant
entered
and
ushered
in
a
lady
riversdale
cried
nathan
gomer
loudly
all
knew
that
daughter
helen
stood
before
them
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
that
nathan
had
made
careful
arrangements
before
he
came
that
day
with
a
view
to
accomplish
certain
desired
results
hugh
riversdale
was
received
with
quiet
but
respectful
attention
the
unhappy
circumstances
connected
with
her
family
were
known
to
all
were
commiserated
and
had
created
sincere
sympathy
in
the
breasts
of
all
present
nathan
gomer
did
not
permit
their
thoughts
to
dwell
upon
what
had
passed
but
at
once
in
a
courteous
manner
addressed
her
very
kindly
volunteered
to
testify
to
the
worth
of
miss
lotte
clinton
he
said
and
wherever
i
might
request
you
to
do
so
i
could
have
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
interposed
helen
emphatically
nathan
said
to
her
instantly
wish
you
would
give
wilton
your
impressions
concerning
if
ever
helen
grahame
spoke
fervently
earnestly
passionately
she
did
so
now
oh
she
found
words
inexpressive
to
record
the
obligations
she
was
under
to
lotte
or
her
daily
increasing
sense
of
their
value
which
had
no
measure
of
requital
her
ardour
of
expression
her
tears
her
emotion
in
making
her
acknowledgments
of
uniform
unselfish
acts
of
kindness
overwhelmed
wilton
he
could
not
reply
to
her
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
then
flora
knelt
at
his
feet
and
she
said
watched
in
your
sickness
and
prostration
over
you
with
tender
patience
and
amiable
sweetness
she
soothed
your
anxiety
and
your
pain
by
her
attention
when
you
were
awake
her
mild
kind
eyes
rarely
left
you
when
you
slept
you
yourself
have
said
that
her
face
greeted
you
like
a
burst
of
sunshine
that
it
was
radiant
with
a
galaxy
of
glories
for
it
was
cheerful
amiable
placid
gentle
good
wilton
sprang
up
and
said
in
a
hoarse
husky
voice
mark
mark
my
boy
miss
clinton
your
your
choice
is
is
own
little
pet
nurse
replied
mark
with
evident
excitement
wilton
sank
down
in
his
seat
again
see
it
all
he
said
understand
her
better
now
mark
my
son
the
last
shred
of
false
pride
has
been
wrested
from
me
i
see
the
precipice
on
which
i
have
been
standing
and
i
draw
back
in
thankfulness
if
any
persuasions
of
mine
can
induce
miss
clinton
now
to
accept
you
i
will
use
them
until
they
become
entreaties
she
shall
be
yours
and
happy
you
will
be
with
her
unless
you
yourself
destroy
the
felicity
her
gentleness
will
weave
around
so
far
all
was
well
and
now
mark
explained
to
him
how
he
had
sought
to
induce
her
to
become
his
wife
and
how
she
refused
him
because
she
would
not
create
dissension
in
his
family
even
though
a
life
of
sorrow
was
entailed
on
her
by
her
own
refusal
and
helen
explained
how
she
had
declined
her
offer
of
an
independence
for
a
reason
which
she
would
not
explain
but
which
really
was
that
if
wilton
found
that
her
means
were
far
better
than
he
had
anticipated
he
might
consent
to
receive
her
into
his
family
she
felt
that
thus
solicitations
would
be
renewed
and
as
she
was
too
to
enter
his
family
by
such
a
she
believed
it
would
occasion
her
less
pain
to
remain
unsought
in
her
old
condition
than
to
have
again
to
refuse
entreaties
to
become
his
besides
she
loved
him
so
dearly
that
she
was
afraid
of
her
own
strength
to
continue
to
say
nay
when
wilton
heard
all
these
things
about
her
he
felt
at
once
overjoyed
and
grieved
glad
that
his
son
had
made
such
a
choice
pained
that
he
had
so
harshly
interfered
to
prevent
the
union
but
he
determined
as
far
as
possible
to
repair
his
conduct
and
he
expressed
his
intention
of
doing
so
without
delay
and
that
very
evening
he
decided
on
the
course
he
should
pursue
on
the
morning
following
that
eventful
evening
lotte
was
seated
alone
as
usual
at
work
and
as
usual
thinking
about
mark
and
harleydale
and
many
other
matters
connected
with
him
and
his
family
she
knew
the
family
were
in
town
and
she
was
in
the
act
of
wishing
that
she
could
get
an
opportunity
of
gazing
on
mark
dear
dear
mark
unseen
when
she
was
startled
by
a
gentle
tap
at
her
she
ran
lightly
to
it
and
opened
it
and
found
herself
face
to
face
with
wilton
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
blushed
like
a
rose
then
turned
as
pale
as
marble
she
however
asked
wilton
into
the
room
and
placed
a
chair
for
him
he
said
as
he
seated
himself
little
runaway
i
have
found
you
at
last
have
i
pray
what
have
you
to
say
in
extenuation
of
deserting
a
poor
crippled
invalid
without
one
word
at
parting
tell
me
had
i
so
wearied
tired
exhausted
you
that
you
ran
away
worn
out
determined
to
be
no
more
troubled
with
such
a
plaguy
old
fellow
as
i
sir
indeed
i
do
assure
you
no
returned
lotte
embarrassed
would
not
for
worlds
undertake
the
same
office
again
eh
said
wilton
eyeing
her
askance
i
would
sir
cheerfully
she
replied
trembling
like
an
aspen
again
she
hesitated
she
was
unconscious
that
he
now
knew
who
his
nurse
was
and
she
did
not
like
disguising
the
truth
but
how
to
reveal
it
she
saw
no
way
indeed
repeated
wilton
listen
to
me
i
have
proved
your
value
you
made
yourself
essential
to
my
comfort
and
i
am
quite
lost
without
you
i
therefore
come
now
to
offer
you
a
home
with
my
family
you
to
be
as
you
have
been
my
pet
confidential
lotte
listened
to
him
with
undisguised
fright
no
no
sir
no
no
she
replied
hurriedly
can
not
possibly
he
echoed
not
pardon
my
not
answering
that
question
do
not
ask
me
sir
she
exclaimed
appealingly
mean
not
my
refusal
offensively
but
in
truth
sir
it
can
not
in
that
capacity
perhaps
he
said
rising
up
and
speaking
with
grave
earnestness
will
you
not
come
back
as
as
as
my
daughter
exclaimed
lotte
clutching
at
the
table
in
her
deep
emotion
the
wife
of
my
son
mark
wilton
he
replied
with
energy
my
beloved
esteemed
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
pressed
her
to
his
breast
know
all
now
i
honour
you
my
child
he
said
warmly
details
of
your
past
history
have
been
made
known
to
me
and
i
blush
when
i
think
how
nobly
you
an
unassisted
helpless
girl
have
sustained
your
integrity
your
virtuous
truthfulness
your
against
all
temptations
and
assaults
against
which
i
more
fortified
to
withstand
them
have
fallen
back
i
should
my
child
now
be
proud
of
you
as
a
friend
i
shall
be
prouder
still
of
you
as
a
daughter
ever
ever
glad
of
your
sweet
presence
in
my
household
recording
few
happier
days
in
my
past
history
than
that
which
sees
you
wedded
to
my
poor
lotte
all
her
trials
and
her
griefs
were
nothing
to
this
they
needed
courage
to
meet
and
firmness
to
bear
them
this
announcement
by
wilton
was
the
very
bursting
of
a
white
cloud
of
happiness
and
she
could
only
sob
passionately
on
his
shoulder
without
uttering
one
word
in
reply
as
soon
as
the
old
man
who
was
much
affected
could
recover
his
voice
he
summoned
an
individual
who
was
waiting
without
with
most
feverish
impatience
mark
entered
and
pronounced
her
name
and
she
lifted
her
weeping
face
from
his
shoulder
and
with
a
faint
effort
at
a
smile
tendered
him
her
hand
that
instalment
was
insufficient
for
his
requirements
he
relieved
his
father
of
his
charge
took
her
in
his
own
arms
and
folded
them
about
her
and
he
whispered
softly
in
her
ear
you
refuse
to
be
mine
now
dearest
dearest
lotte
mark
she
murmured
heart
is
so
full
i
can
not
speak
to
you
not
one
little
word
lotte
he
urged
see
here
is
flora
will
you
not
greet
her
as
your
sister
and
in
truth
there
was
flora
who
in
her
turn
took
possession
of
lotte
and
nathan
gomer
who
had
no
intention
of
being
out
of
the
way
where
happiness
was
going
on
and
now
the
question
was
put
formally
to
lotte
that
she
might
no
more
have
misgivings
about
the
nature
of
her
reception
in
family
whether
she
would
mark
for
her
husband
lotte
murmured
something
about
consulting
her
brother
charley
such
a
notion
was
at
once
promptly
and
generally
ignored
and
so
she
said
clearly
and
earnestly
that
to
wed
mark
would
be
the
happiest
event
which
could
happen
to
her
in
her
whole
life
of
course
she
was
borne
off
in
triumph
to
mansion
in
the
park
where
to
her
satisfaction
she
found
assembled
to
meet
her
helen
riversdale
and
her
husband
and
eva
grahame
and
her
brother
charley
after
the
first
greetings
were
over
nathan
gomer
commenced
an
oration
in
which
he
gave
a
rough
sketch
of
the
wealth
he
possessed
he
then
stated
that
he
had
exchanged
with
wilton
the
eglinton
estates
for
harleydale
hall
and
manor
and
which
he
now
presented
to
lotte
as
a
dower
that
she
might
still
preserve
her
noble
spirit
unchanged
for
she
would
not
come
to
her
husband
empty
handed
to
flora
he
presented
the
estate
on
which
her
mother
had
been
born
and
in
her
youth
lived
to
hugh
riversdale
he
presented
the
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
late
estates
and
the
remainder
he
handed
to
charles
clinton
as
a
gift
to
him
and
to
his
eva
for
that
union
had
been
all
arranged
through
the
instrumentality
of
helen
who
had
suffered
too
much
misery
herself
to
attempt
to
entail
it
upon
her
young
and
loving
sister
steps
were
taken
to
release
malcolm
grahame
and
as
it
was
clear
he
was
not
fit
for
anything
it
was
determined
to
provide
him
with
an
appointment
in
a
government
office
little
more
now
remains
to
be
told
colonel
mires
having
met
the
fate
he
richly
deserved
chewkle
was
visited
with
poetical
justice
unromantic
and
enough
to
him
before
his
trial
he
sent
for
nathan
gomer
and
the
little
man
anxious
to
get
possession
of
the
forged
deed
visited
him
at
the
interview
that
ensued
chewkle
gave
him
the
key
of
his
effects
and
stated
how
he
wished
them
bestowed
he
expressed
contrition
for
his
guilt
and
promised
if
he
had
the
chance
he
would
reform
at
his
trial
he
was
found
guilty
and
owing
to
recommendation
to
mercy
for
that
he
had
been
tempted
by
a
bribe
to
undertake
the
crime
he
was
let
off
with
twenty
penal
servitude
the
forged
deed
was
obtained
destroyed
and
effects
distributed
as
he
wished
with
certain
additions
to
his
poor
relatives
who
were
thus
benefited
by
his
roguery
in
a
way
they
could
never
have
expected
the
fate
of
margaret
grahame
would
have
been
a
sad
one
but
for
the
timely
interposition
of
hugh
riversdale
as
soon
as
nathan
and
his
own
arrangements
were
completed
he
sought
out
the
duke
of
allborne
but
it
was
not
until
after
incessant
efforts
assisted
by
skilful
aid
that
he
was
able
to
meet
and
confront
him
then
his
proceedings
with
him
were
summary
he
gave
to
the
duke
the
alternative
of
making
margaret
his
duchess
or
of
meeting
him
in
mortal
combat
as
the
duke
saw
that
hugh
was
resolved
and
vindictive
and
as
it
seemed
more
than
probable
he
might
fall
in
the
encounter
he
accepted
the
alternative
and
quietly
made
margaret
his
wife
taking
her
at
once
abroad
to
spend
the
honeymoon
where
he
introduced
her
into
society
preparatory
to
bringing
her
to
london
to
occupy
the
station
in
which
he
had
now
placed
her
lester
vane
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
the
effects
of
his
leap
took
the
benefit
of
the
insolvent
act
and
became
a
confirmed
blackleg
in
due
course
the
three
weddings
were
celebrated
and
there
exists
no
evidence
to
prove
other
than
that
the
six
individuals
united
by
the
nearest
and
dearest
tie
were
by
that
ceremony
made
the
very
happiest
beings
in
the
world
and
that
they
continued
to
be
so
for
the
term
of
their
natural
lives
eustace
wilton
after
all
became
lord
of
eglinton
and
beneath
his
roof
dwelt
in
honour
and
peace
nathan
gomer
he
would
be
addressed
by
no
other
name
together
they
argued
discussed
and
contended
and
were
as
happy
as
any
two
old
gentlemen
in
the
wide
world
could
wish
to
be
as
the
main
incidents
in
this
tale
are
founded
upon
facts
it
will
hardly
be
considered
unnecessary
to
draw
attention
to
the
moral
it
is
intended
to
convey
a
path
of
rectitude
is
laid
down
in
social
life
for
all
alike
rich
or
poor
to
pursue
it
is
beset
with
snares
and
pitfalls
with
inducements
seductions
and
temptations
to
turn
aside
almost
at
every
step
to
adhere
however
to
the
fixed
principle
of
acting
rightly
in
every
situation
in
life
demands
no
common
powers
a
peculiar
strength
of
mind
a
clearness
of
perception
to
distinguish
the
real
from
the
unreal
correct
which
is
something
more
than
common
sense
and
even
a
course
of
instruction
are
deemed
little
less
than
essential
to
achieve
the
difficult
task
of
pursuing
that
path
unswervingly
is
one
thing
to
be
tempted
escalus
another
thing
to
when
those
who
have
been
born
in
the
lap
of
luxury
have
been
nurtured
with
tenderness
instructed
with
care
reared
in
plenty
surrounded
by
blessings
caressed
with
holy
affection
elevated
above
the
incitements
of
want
and
gifted
with
that
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
which
is
imparted
by
the
cultivation
of
the
mind
and
the
aid
of
religion
yield
to
temptation
and
fall
away
before
seductive
arts
what
shall
be
said
of
her
who
unaided
by
any
of
these
advantages
passes
through
her
path
of
fire
uncharred
what
is
she
among
her
human
sisters
who
endowed
alone
with
that
fatal
gift
to
the
poor
girl
fair
looks
struggles
with
penury
and
starvation
toils
from
dawn
far
far
into
the
long
night
with
dim
and
weary
eyelids
and
aching
fingers
endures
the
severest
straits
of
destitution
arising
from
most
scantily
remunerated
labour
yet
faces
her
danger
nobly
resists
those
fascinating
temptations
which
are
so
terrible
in
their
power
to
the
beautiful
but
penniless
of
her
sex
wrestles
bravely
with
her
narrowed
means
and
rising
superior
to
all
those
allurements
which
are
aided
by
the
urgings
of
grim
want
preserves
her
purity
and
her
unsullied
and
her
independence
unabased
what
is
she
among
women
who
being
driven
by
society
itself
in
its
hunger
on
the
one
hand
after
wealth
and
on
the
other
after
cheapness
into
the
very
corner
of
desperation
comes
from
her
crushing
ordeal
unbruised
and
undefiled
is
she
not
a
of
the
flock
oh
reader
look
about
you
there
are
many
lotte
clintons
in
the
throes
of
mortal
agony
nearer
to
you
than
you
suspect
if
they
are
fainting
under
their
burden
can
you
not
afford
them
a
little
aid
to
surmount
their
miserable
destitution
and
lift
them
out
of
their
despair
remember
the
dreadful
alternative
the
end
