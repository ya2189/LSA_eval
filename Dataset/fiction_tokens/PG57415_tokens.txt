who
did
it
never
as
long
as
ella
winter
lives
will
she
forget
the
picture
that
imprinted
itself
on
her
brain
as
instantaneously
as
though
it
had
been
photographed
there
at
the
moment
when
startled
by
aaron
cry
she
stepped
out
of
the
window
of
the
on
the
borders
of
the
lawn
at
the
foot
of
a
large
the
leaves
of
which
glistened
brightly
in
the
morning
sun
knelt
aaron
his
rugged
features
working
convulsively
his
trembling
arms
twined
round
the
unconscious
form
of
him
who
lay
there
in
all
the
moveless
majesty
of
death
one
glance
at
the
white
set
face
and
ella
knew
that
the
wanderer
whose
absence
had
caused
so
much
speculation
had
come
back
at
last
but
that
whatever
secrets
he
might
have
in
his
keeping
would
remain
secrets
still
and
would
never
be
whispered
in
mortal
ear
the
pulses
of
her
life
stood
still
as
she
gazed
in
her
shock
of
bewilderment
the
old
man
voice
broke
the
spell
he
saw
her
standing
there
oh
my
dear
young
mistress
it
is
my
boy
my
boy
come
back
to
me
dead
there
has
been
murder
done
here
a
shudder
ran
through
ella
murder
was
it
true
or
was
old
aaron
demented
she
rushed
indoors
to
the
ringing
its
bells
as
they
had
never
been
rung
before
and
then
she
sank
into
a
chair
never
had
ella
winter
been
so
near
fainting
the
servants
came
running
in
and
she
strove
to
collect
her
thoughts
some
one
ran
to
the
huge
bell
that
rang
in
the
and
sounded
a
peal
upon
it
it
brought
forth
the
coachman
barnet
john
tilney
came
up
with
one
of
his
men
barnet
satisfied
himself
that
hubert
stone
was
really
dead
also
that
he
had
in
all
probability
been
murdered
he
then
sped
back
to
his
and
saddled
a
horse
to
ride
forth
in
search
of
a
doctor
fetch
the
nearest
doctor
you
can
find
had
been
miss
gasping
order
to
him
and
he
hastened
to
obey
it
by
barnet
orders
the
groom
rode
forth
on
another
horse
to
summon
the
from
his
office
at
nullington
the
frightened
maids
had
gathered
round
miss
winter
when
dorothy
stone
appeared
in
the
doorway
tying
her
with
trembling
fingers
the
bells
and
the
commotion
had
startled
her
but
she
did
not
know
what
had
happened
at
sight
of
the
patient
furrowed
face
and
the
dim
blue
eyes
just
now
full
of
anxious
wonder
a
great
pity
took
the
heart
of
miss
winter
and
the
tears
filled
her
own
eyes
as
she
went
up
to
the
old
woman
and
led
her
away
no
need
for
her
to
know
the
terrible
news
just
yet
toynbee
next
appeared
upon
the
scene
she
had
waited
to
dress
her
first
act
was
to
order
the
servants
away
to
their
duties
her
second
to
speak
with
john
tilney
it
was
by
her
directions
that
he
and
his
two
men
for
the
other
man
had
come
up
now
carried
the
young
fellow
into
a
room
on
the
then
with
much
tact
and
gentleness
toynbee
succeeded
in
persuading
aaron
who
seemed
with
grief
and
horror
to
allow
himself
to
be
got
into
his
own
apartments
by
tilney
nothing
more
could
be
done
till
the
arrival
of
the
doctor
and
the
police
spreckley
and
wade
reached
heron
dyke
together
driving
over
in
a
gig
from
the
rose
and
crown
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
look
at
the
dead
that
hubert
stone
had
been
murdered
a
very
slight
examination
sufficed
to
prove
he
had
been
stabbed
through
the
heart
with
a
stiletto
or
some
other
sharp
instrument
the
disordered
state
of
his
attire
as
well
as
the
condition
of
the
gravel
walk
showed
that
he
had
not
met
his
fate
without
a
struggle
some
desperate
encounter
must
have
taken
place
but
what
had
brought
him
there
why
had
he
come
back
to
heron
dyke
in
the
or
perhaps
it
might
have
been
at
the
first
glimmer
of
dawn
these
were
the
questions
that
ran
around
miss
thoughts
which
she
kept
to
herself
ran
in
somewhat
a
different
groove
might
he
not
have
come
back
by
train
the
previous
day
she
asked
herself
and
have
intended
to
call
on
her
in
the
evening
and
been
afraid
or
ashamed
to
do
so
and
so
have
lingered
about
the
grounds
until
it
was
too
late
too
late
also
perhaps
to
gain
admittance
to
his
old
rooms
at
the
lodge
and
so
he
had
probably
paced
about
during
the
night
hours
and
had
disturbed
the
thief
or
thieves
in
the
act
of
rifling
the
bureau
miss
winter
mind
lost
itself
in
troubled
conjectures
examination
showed
that
a
hole
had
been
cut
with
a
diamond
in
the
window
of
the
room
where
the
jewels
lay
the
window
opened
and
the
shutters
forced
from
their
hinges
the
bureau
must
then
have
been
opened
by
means
of
a
chisel
or
other
blunt
instrument
and
the
jewels
stolen
from
their
receptacle
most
probably
it
was
at
the
moment
the
burglar
was
leaving
the
room
with
his
booty
that
he
was
encountered
by
hubert
stone
perhaps
seized
by
him
how
the
probably
unequal
struggle
had
ended
was
but
too
terribly
manifest
apparently
nothing
in
hubert
pockets
had
been
touched
his
watch
chain
and
leather
purse
were
all
there
but
no
letters
or
papers
of
any
kind
from
which
a
clue
might
be
obtained
as
to
his
recent
movements
or
to
the
place
from
whence
he
had
come
his
watch
has
stopped
at
twenty
minutes
past
two
observed
spreckley
who
was
making
this
examination
with
mr
inspector
wade
and
that
may
have
been
the
time
of
the
fatal
occurrence
poor
fellow
what
in
here
i
wonder
the
doctor
was
opening
the
gold
locket
attached
to
the
as
he
made
the
last
remark
and
it
was
as
well
perhaps
all
things
considered
that
the
inspector
did
not
hear
it
that
he
had
turned
momentarily
away
for
inside
the
locket
was
a
portrait
of
miss
winter
spreckley
eyes
opened
in
more
ways
than
one
presuming
rascal
he
involuntarily
cried
apostrophising
the
unconscious
dead
my
poor
young
man
you
must
have
been
more
silly
than
i
gave
you
credit
for
i
take
possession
of
this
any
way
no
good
to
let
the
world
see
it
he
decided
as
he
dexterously
removed
the
likeness
and
slipped
it
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
what
that
asked
the
inspector
coming
back
only
this
said
spreckley
exhibiting
the
empty
locket
that
the
person
or
persons
who
committed
the
robbery
had
also
committed
the
murder
appeared
perfectly
conclusive
to
inspector
wade
and
so
he
informed
miss
winter
with
whom
he
requested
an
interview
of
course
she
had
herself
drawn
the
same
conclusion
he
then
asked
miss
winter
whether
she
had
the
slightest
suspicion
with
regard
to
the
honesty
of
any
of
her
servants
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
thieves
must
have
had
some
acquaintance
with
the
house
and
knew
the
exact
spot
where
to
look
for
the
jewels
and
they
had
apparently
made
no
attempt
to
obtain
any
other
booty
miss
winter
replied
in
most
decisive
terms
that
she
had
not
the
slightest
reason
to
suspect
the
honesty
of
any
person
about
her
but
indeed
she
added
it
is
impossible
that
any
of
the
servants
can
be
guilty
they
were
not
even
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
jewels
much
less
of
the
place
where
they
were
deposited
those
were
facts
known
to
no
one
save
myself
and
mrs
toynbee
the
who
had
a
pencil
in
his
hand
passed
it
once
or
twice
thoughtfully
across
his
lips
pardon
me
the
remark
miss
winter
he
said
looking
up
but
may
i
ask
how
it
came
to
pass
that
you
found
no
safer
receptacle
for
this
valuable
amount
of
property
than
an
old
bureau
in
a
on
the
and
which
has
a
window
opening
to
the
ground
any
tyro
of
a
burglar
could
force
an
entrance
in
ten
minutes
but
she
objected
how
was
any
burglar
to
know
that
such
property
was
there
it
seems
madam
that
one
at
all
events
did
know
it
it
pardon
me
seems
like
throwing
temptation
in
a
thief
way
i
again
repeat
that
their
being
deposited
there
and
also
that
such
jewels
were
in
existence
was
an
entire
secret
between
myself
and
toynbee
she
replied
had
it
not
been
so
i
should
have
removed
them
to
a
safer
place
if
you
will
listen
a
moment
wade
i
will
tell
you
how
it
all
came
about
and
how
the
jewels
were
found
he
listened
as
she
related
the
facts
how
she
had
caused
this
old
carved
bureau
to
be
brought
downstairs
to
her
that
she
might
search
it
for
certain
papers
relating
to
the
estate
which
she
fancied
might
be
in
existence
she
failed
to
find
the
papers
but
to
her
intense
surprise
she
found
in
a
secret
drawer
this
large
quantity
of
jewels
toynbee
was
present
and
she
had
warned
her
that
nothing
must
be
said
to
the
servants
toynbee
fully
agreed
with
her
after
examining
the
jewels
they
were
replaced
in
their
until
she
could
see
daventry
and
talk
the
affair
over
with
him
it
is
impossible
concluded
miss
winter
looking
at
the
inspector
that
the
facts
can
have
become
known
wade
somewhat
mystified
made
no
reply
for
a
moment
or
two
but
you
can
not
fail
to
see
madam
he
urged
that
the
fact
of
your
having
found
the
jewels
must
have
leaked
out
somehow
as
well
as
a
knowledge
of
the
place
where
they
were
placed
this
burglary
was
no
mere
affair
it
was
evidently
premeditated
carefully
planned
beforehand
it
certainly
does
seem
like
it
admitted
ella
but
i
assure
you
i
can
not
understand
it
toynbee
i
think
i
had
better
see
mrs
toynbee
toynbee
was
called
in
and
came
full
of
nervous
trepidation
she
had
been
sitting
upon
pins
and
needles
as
old
dorothy
stone
would
have
expressed
it
ever
since
wade
had
been
shut
in
with
miss
winter
the
inspector
noted
her
aspect
and
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
he
did
not
say
to
her
madam
have
you
mentioned
the
fact
to
any
one
that
such
jewels
were
found
he
said
to
whom
did
you
mention
it
her
colour
went
and
came
her
heart
was
beating
her
trembling
fingers
could
not
hold
the
needle
for
she
had
some
in
her
hands
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
been
very
thoughtless
and
foolish
she
began
with
a
quaver
of
the
voice
of
course
i
quite
understood
that
no
mention
of
the
jewels
was
to
be
made
in
presence
of
any
of
the
domestics
but
it
never
struck
me
that
the
prohibition
was
intended
to
be
a
general
one
you
may
remember
my
dear
miss
winter
that
i
went
to
the
lilacs
in
your
place
on
thursday
afternoon
to
the
and
and
somehow
we
ladies
were
all
talking
together
one
topic
led
to
another
and
toynbee
broke
down
from
sheer
nervousness
and
you
told
of
the
finding
of
the
jewels
and
where
they
were
deposited
spoke
up
the
inspector
it
was
led
up
to
she
said
excusing
her
self
in
the
best
way
she
could
and
hardly
able
to
keep
from
tears
the
ladies
had
been
saying
to
me
that
i
must
find
a
country
life
very
much
lacking
in
excitement
after
the
metropolis
to
which
i
replied
that
we
were
not
always
destitute
of
excitement
even
in
the
country
and
i
i
then
did
speak
of
the
jewels
but
who
was
to
imagine
she
added
plucking
up
a
little
spirit
that
even
the
smallest
danger
could
exist
in
mentioning
it
among
ladies
they
are
all
as
trustworthy
as
we
are
do
i
gather
madam
that
only
ladies
were
present
said
the
inspector
no
gentlemen
it
was
a
meeting
for
ladies
only
replied
toynbee
one
gentleman
came
in
towards
the
last
philip
cleeve
he
came
to
fetch
his
mother
i
remember
he
made
a
remark
to
the
effect
that
the
bureau
was
not
a
very
safe
place
to
leave
the
jewels
in
a
very
sensible
remark
to
make
under
the
circumstances
returned
the
inspector
drily
madam
can
you
give
me
the
names
of
the
ladies
who
were
present
oh
yes
replied
toynbee
we
were
not
many
eight
or
ten
or
so
and
she
succeeded
in
remembering
all
the
names
they
were
all
gentlewomen
all
trustworthy
as
the
inspector
had
reason
to
know
and
believe
one
of
them
must
have
mentioned
it
abroad
in
the
hearing
of
some
dangerous
ears
he
said
to
himself
madam
he
added
aloud
to
miss
winter
i
will
not
detain
you
further
at
present
but
it
may
be
necessary
to
see
you
again
whenever
you
will
wade
she
sighed
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
altogether
and
very
mysterious
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
had
nothing
but
painful
mysteries
for
some
time
now
at
heron
dyke
the
glanced
rather
keenly
at
miss
winter
in
answer
to
this
and
took
his
leave
as
he
closed
the
door
toynbee
suppressed
tears
burst
forth
i
am
heartbroken
my
dear
she
sobbed
and
in
truth
she
did
seem
bitterly
repentant
perfectly
heartbroken
to
think
that
any
thoughtless
remarks
of
mine
should
have
conduced
in
any
way
to
this
terrible
catastrophe
i
never
thought
that
anything
i
might
say
in
a
moment
of
confidence
i
should
not
have
thought
there
was
much
danger
in
it
myself
interrupted
miss
winter
kindly
do
not
distress
yourself
they
must
have
talked
of
it
again
you
see
and
so
it
must
have
got
about
and
come
to
the
knowledge
of
improper
people
oh
dear
wailed
toynbee
yes
that
is
how
it
must
have
been
i
wish
i
had
known
nothing
about
the
jewels
leaving
her
to
her
repentant
sorrow
ella
went
to
see
after
poor
stone
dorothy
she
knew
the
worst
now
was
in
her
own
leaning
back
in
an
before
a
good
fire
attired
in
her
sunday
gown
and
cap
a
soft
black
twill
trimmed
handsomely
with
crape
a
cap
of
white
net
and
black
gauze
ribbon
for
they
were
yet
in
deep
mourning
for
the
squire
perhaps
some
vague
idea
of
its
being
a
sort
of
holiday
for
the
old
woman
would
do
no
work
that
day
had
induced
her
to
put
these
best
things
on
at
dorothy
age
the
outward
signs
of
great
emotions
last
but
for
a
little
while
tears
may
come
but
they
do
not
flow
so
plentifully
as
in
youth
the
springs
are
deeper
down
and
more
difficult
to
reach
and
when
found
are
sometimes
almost
dry
as
age
creeps
on
and
one
or
other
of
our
loved
ones
drops
silently
from
our
side
it
seems
but
such
a
little
time
till
we
hope
to
see
them
again
the
period
of
separation
is
so
short
as
they
are
we
ourselves
shall
so
soon
be
that
we
can
not
mourn
their
loss
with
that
intensity
which
we
should
have
felt
in
youth
when
the
plains
before
us
stretched
to
a
limitless
horizon
and
our
heartstrings
were
responsive
to
the
slightest
touch
the
young
mistress
sat
down
beside
dorothy
and
took
one
of
the
old
woman
withered
hands
between
her
own
that
soft
warm
caressing
touch
unsealed
again
the
fountains
of
the
aged
heart
with
her
other
hand
she
lifted
a
corner
of
her
apron
to
her
eyes
for
a
minute
or
two
neither
of
them
spoke
what
a
handsome
brave
lad
he
was
miss
ella
cried
dorothy
at
length
fit
to
be
a
lord
son
any
day
and
with
as
bold
and
masterful
a
spirit
as
any
gentleman
need
wish
to
have
and
now
to
think
of
him
lying
there
white
and
cold
and
dumb
he
that
had
a
laugh
and
a
ready
word
for
everybody
alack
alack
if
i
could
but
be
lying
there
instead
of
him
my
poor
dorothy
i
do
indeed
feel
for
you
i
knew
when
i
saw
the
headless
horses
and
the
black
coach
that
night
in
the
park
that
there
would
be
a
death
among
us
before
long
she
continued
but
i
little
thought
my
own
bright
boy
would
be
the
one
to
go
ah
we
never
know
we
never
know
though
he
was
ill
that
night
with
his
throat
and
that
might
have
whispered
to
me
that
the
apparition
was
for
him
dorothy
do
not
dwell
upon
such
things
miss
ella
trust
an
old
woman
who
has
had
a
vast
experience
of
life
such
signs
and
tokens
are
not
sent
for
nothing
though
some
folks
may
laugh
at
you
for
heeding
them
they
are
warnings
from
another
world
added
the
old
woman
solemnly
and
some
day
it
may
be
made
plain
to
us
why
they
are
sent
an
inquest
was
held
some
evidence
was
taken
and
then
it
was
adjourned
for
a
week
that
the
police
might
have
time
to
make
further
investigations
they
could
not
as
yet
learn
that
one
suspicious
person
had
known
of
the
jewels
of
all
miss
winter
friends
the
one
to
make
himself
most
busy
was
the
vicar
of
nullington
an
idle
man
in
general
kettle
could
be
aroused
in
a
case
like
this
all
his
sympathies
were
with
miss
winter
and
his
curiosity
was
on
the
alert
after
all
he
observed
to
that
young
lady
one
day
when
he
was
sitting
with
her
to
discuss
details
after
all
the
most
mysterious
part
of
the
affair
is
not
the
sudden
appearance
of
hubert
stone
on
the
scene
i
daresay
he
could
readily
account
for
that
poor
fellow
if
he
were
living
perhaps
he
got
in
by
the
on
the
sunday
night
which
you
know
passes
at
nearly
one
in
the
morning
and
did
not
care
to
knock
people
up
no
the
mystery
lies
in
how
the
information
as
to
the
of
the
jewels
reached
the
cognisance
of
the
rogue
who
stole
them
and
really
as
wade
justly
observed
it
would
seem
next
to
a
certainty
that
the
thief
must
be
someone
who
had
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
premises
of
heron
dyke
you
must
see
that
my
dear
for
yourself
i
fear
i
do
sighed
ella
so
far
as
people
recollection
serves
toynbee
mentioned
simply
that
the
bureau
had
been
removed
to
your
miss
now
how
should
a
common
thief
know
which
was
miss
winter
it
is
only
since
the
squire
died
and
your
return
that
you
have
made
it
such
true
assented
ella
and
altogether
taking
one
thing
with
another
i
feel
inclined
to
think
it
might
have
been
no
common
thief
who
took
them
ella
lifted
her
eyes
quickly
have
you
any
suspicions
of
any
one
in
particular
no
my
dear
no
he
answered
slowly
and
she
thought
dubiously
we
can
but
wait
perhaps
wade
may
ferret
out
more
particulars
but
on
the
same
evening
when
the
vicar
was
at
home
safe
within
the
four
walls
of
his
study
he
dropped
a
word
or
two
that
nearly
scared
his
daughter
out
of
her
senses
somehow
he
had
caught
up
a
doubt
in
his
own
mind
of
philip
cleeve
oh
papa
exclaimed
maria
in
an
accent
of
indignant
horror
i
do
say
it
was
he
maria
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
do
that
or
to
breathe
a
syllable
of
this
doubt
to
any
one
but
you
still
i
can
not
shut
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
things
with
regard
to
philip
do
look
somewhat
suspicious
and
downes
has
long
thought
the
same
papa
papa
she
repeated
see
here
child
in
all
the
mysterious
robberies
that
have
taken
place
and
puzzled
us
for
the
past
eighteen
months
philip
has
been
present
beginning
with
carlyon
jewels
he
was
at
her
house
the
evening
they
were
stolen
he
was
with
downes
when
he
lost
his
he
was
with
me
when
my
purse
disappeared
and
egad
if
you
come
to
that
added
the
vicar
speaking
rather
unguardedly
in
his
heat
of
recollection
he
was
with
lennox
and
freddy
bootle
in
london
the
night
they
lost
things
the
one
his
watch
the
other
his
money
this
is
dreadful
gasped
maria
papa
it
is
not
true
it
can
not
be
i
would
answer
for
philip
with
my
life
very
unwise
of
you
my
dear
i
have
not
finished
when
that
ridiculous
woman
up
yonder
pointing
his
finger
in
the
direction
of
heron
dyke
blurted
out
the
story
of
the
jewels
at
ducie
and
where
they
were
deposited
philip
cleeve
heard
her
he
was
the
only
man
present
i
do
accuse
him
i
say
maria
but
i
can
not
get
these
truths
out
of
my
mind
and
for
answer
maria
burst
into
a
flood
of
distressed
tears
the
funeral
of
hubert
stone
took
place
and
was
attended
by
half
the
population
of
nullington
old
aaron
was
chief
mourner
on
the
coffin
lay
a
wreath
of
exquisite
flowers
placed
there
before
it
left
the
hall
by
the
hands
of
one
by
whom
the
past
had
been
forgiven
a
day
or
two
later
the
jury
met
again
nothing
fresh
had
been
discovered
the
police
found
out
that
hubert
stone
had
come
by
train
from
london
on
the
saturday
he
had
stayed
at
a
small
inn
a
mile
or
two
away
until
the
sunday
evening
and
had
then
gone
out
from
that
hour
he
had
never
been
seen
alive
so
far
as
could
be
traced
the
verdict
returned
was
wilful
murder
against
some
person
or
persons
unknown
rewards
were
offered
for
any
discovery
one
by
miss
winter
another
by
government
spreckley
had
taken
an
opportunity
of
giving
to
miss
winter
the
likeness
he
had
taken
from
hubert
locket
so
foolish
of
the
young
man
he
lightly
remarked
but
i
fancy
he
had
as
great
a
reverence
for
you
his
mistress
as
he
had
for
the
squire
yes
said
ella
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
dear
spreckley
she
earnestly
added
and
she
put
the
bit
of
in
the
fire
there
and
then
ella
had
some
intimate
friends
living
close
to
norwich
the
cursitors
old
colonel
cursitor
he
was
hale
and
hearty
yet
and
the
squire
had
been
companions
in
early
life
some
of
them
came
over
and
insisted
upon
carrying
ella
back
with
them
for
a
week
and
she
was
glad
to
yield
to
get
away
toynbee
took
the
opportunity
to
get
away
also
and
went
to
stay
with
her
sister
in
london
this
need
not
have
been
mentioned
but
for
a
little
matter
that
occurred
during
their
absence
the
servant
girl
betsy
tucker
was
taken
ill
her
symptoms
were
those
of
fever
and
old
aaron
protested
that
she
should
be
got
out
of
the
house
a
pretty
thing
if
the
hall
is
to
be
filled
with
typhus
and
what
not
he
growled
for
hubert
death
did
not
seem
to
have
sweetened
his
temper
a
nice
sort
of
that
would
be
let
her
come
to
me
cried
mrs
keen
briskly
in
whose
hearing
this
was
said
the
landlady
having
gone
to
the
hall
to
see
the
girl
i
am
not
afraid
it
going
to
be
any
thing
infectious
i
do
think
it
is
i
knew
her
mother
you
may
remember
mr
stone
aaron
closed
with
the
offer
at
once
and
the
first
news
that
greeted
the
mistress
of
heron
dyke
returning
from
her
week
visit
to
the
pleasant
city
of
norwich
was
that
betsy
tucker
was
ill
of
fever
and
that
she
had
been
sent
out
of
the
house
by
aaron
to
get
well
or
die
at
the
leaning
gate
miss
winter
showed
herself
to
be
very
angry
at
the
removal
but
the
thing
was
done
chapter
ii
what
priscilla
peyton
had
to
tell
in
a
cheerful
room
at
heron
dyke
with
the
morning
sun
shining
upon
it
there
sat
two
young
women
busily
plying
their
needles
miss
winter
maid
adèle
and
a
dressmaker
one
priscilla
peyton
priscilla
was
a
homely
person
between
thirty
and
forty
who
had
often
been
employed
at
the
hall
they
were
making
a
morning
gown
for
the
hall
mistress
what
am
i
to
do
suddenly
cried
priscilla
it
is
impossible
to
get
on
without
cord
i
thought
you
would
be
sure
to
have
some
up
here
or
i
have
brought
it
with
me
we
generally
do
have
it
plenty
of
it
but
it
was
all
used
up
last
week
miss
peyton
replied
adèle
a
steady
dark
young
woman
who
spoke
english
and
french
equally
well
miss
winter
came
into
the
room
at
this
juncture
and
the
difficulty
was
revealed
to
her
she
said
adèle
had
better
go
to
the
nearest
shop
one
at
this
end
of
nullington
and
buy
some
cord
but
to
this
order
the
dressmaker
looked
as
if
she
would
like
to
demur
what
is
it
priscilla
asked
miss
winter
can
you
not
spare
her
well
the
truth
is
i
shall
be
waiting
for
that
frilling
she
is
hemming
oh
i
will
finish
that
for
you
priscilla
readily
replied
the
young
lady
who
had
a
natural
aptitude
and
liking
for
work
she
took
a
seat
by
the
window
and
adèle
departed
in
search
of
what
was
required
hemming
quickly
at
the
strip
of
cambric
ella
talked
the
while
to
priscilla
peyton
whom
she
had
known
and
esteemed
for
years
it
is
some
time
since
you
were
at
work
here
is
it
not
priscilla
she
remarked
well
it
is
with
so
many
more
maids
in
the
house
stone
gets
done
for
her
what
i
used
to
come
to
do
the
last
time
i
was
here
at
work
was
when
you
were
abroad
miss
ella
and
the
poor
squire
was
lying
did
you
see
him
oh
no
oh
no
nobody
used
to
see
him
then
save
the
doctor
and
that
i
was
here
the
best
part
of
a
week
mending
gowns
for
stone
and
making
her
a
new
one
it
was
only
about
a
fortnight
before
the
squire
died
ella
sighed
priscilla
peyton
bending
over
her
work
spoke
again
i
used
to
think
sitting
in
stone
parlour
how
much
i
should
like
to
see
him
once
again
yes
i
did
i
said
so
one
day
to
eliza
and
she
answered
me
that
i
might
just
as
well
wish
to
see
the
inside
of
the
moon
that
for
months
and
months
nobody
had
been
admitted
to
see
the
squire
but
those
that
had
the
ella
looking
up
from
her
work
stared
at
the
neat
brown
hair
and
the
neat
white
cap
of
the
young
woman
bending
over
hers
as
if
she
were
asking
some
solution
to
the
words
she
repeated
what
were
they
keys
that
would
open
the
green
baize
doors
which
the
squire
had
put
up
to
shut
out
his
rooms
from
the
rest
of
the
house
and
which
were
always
kept
locked
night
and
day
replied
priscilla
and
who
kept
these
there
were
four
of
them
priscilla
said
and
four
people
had
them
one
each
aaron
stone
and
poor
hubert
who
is
just
gone
jago
had
one
and
the
nurse
ella
paused
of
what
nurse
do
you
speak
my
uncle
never
had
a
nurse
indeed
he
had
miss
ella
it
was
a
dexter
sent
for
from
london
by
dr
jago
a
nurse
from
london
this
was
the
first
time
miss
winter
had
heard
of
the
existence
of
such
a
person
at
the
hall
the
revelation
was
not
palatable
to
her
how
long
was
this
dexter
at
the
hall
do
you
know
priscilla
it
was
a
good
while
though
i
ca
say
exactly
i
think
she
was
here
before
christmas
i
am
next
to
sure
of
it
why
yes
i
remember
now
quickly
added
the
young
woman
she
came
in
november
i
was
up
here
one
wet
november
day
and
while
i
was
drying
my
petticoats
at
the
kitchen
fire
phemie
whispered
to
me
that
she
thought
the
master
must
be
worse
for
they
had
got
a
london
nurse
in
the
house
did
this
nurse
remain
with
my
uncle
till
the
last
she
did
she
left
the
day
after
his
death
in
may
miss
winter
said
no
more
she
was
thinking
why
was
the
presence
of
this
nurse
in
the
house
kept
from
her
for
kept
it
assuredly
had
been
why
and
wherefore
had
the
woman
name
never
been
mentioned
to
her
or
the
fact
of
her
having
been
so
long
at
the
hall
her
uncle
had
not
spoken
of
her
in
his
letters
or
hubert
stone
in
his
notes
i
saw
dexter
take
her
departure
resumed
priscilla
as
a
bit
of
gossip
a
lovely
may
morning
it
was
and
i
had
gone
to
the
station
to
see
my
little
nephew
off
by
the
london
train
dexter
drove
up
in
a
fly
with
a
trunk
and
a
little
black
bag
that
she
carried
in
her
hand
and
i
saw
her
get
into
the
train
it
was
but
the
day
after
the
squire
died
the
bells
were
tolling
for
him
and
of
course
but
two
or
three
days
before
miss
winter
return
and
yet
no
one
inmate
of
the
hall
had
informed
her
that
this
nurse
had
been
there
it
was
altogether
very
strange
did
you
say
priscilla
that
people
at
the
last
were
not
admitted
to
see
my
uncle
save
those
who
had
the
not
for
months
and
months
eliza
told
me
she
did
not
believe
a
soul
had
been
allowed
to
go
in
to
see
him
since
the
past
november
no
matter
who
came
the
reverend
kettle
or
any
other
of
the
old
friends
they
were
never
let
go
in
i
wonder
why
involuntarily
exclaimed
miss
winter
that
i
could
say
nobody
could
i
expect
save
jago
it
must
have
been
frightfully
lonely
for
him
poor
sick
gentleman
he
was
never
seen
at
all
or
his
footsteps
heard
or
the
sound
of
his
voice
eliza
said
to
the
girl
it
seemed
just
as
though
he
were
shut
up
in
a
living
tomb
miss
winter
asked
no
more
questions
that
something
and
of
set
purpose
had
been
hidden
from
her
some
drama
enacted
within
those
walls
of
which
it
was
intended
that
she
should
know
nothing
she
fully
believed
and
there
came
rushing
into
her
mind
hubert
words
that
if
the
truth
were
known
she
was
no
more
the
owner
of
heron
dyke
than
he
was
again
and
again
she
asked
herself
what
the
truth
was
and
how
it
could
be
brought
to
light
ella
carried
her
trouble
to
kettle
her
uncle
friend
of
many
years
she
sat
with
him
in
his
study
maria
being
present
she
revealed
to
him
her
doubts
she
hinted
at
hubert
strange
assertion
on
the
wreck
she
repeated
what
priscilla
peyton
had
said
and
then
she
appealed
to
him
to
advise
her
what
she
ought
to
do
next
the
vicar
was
not
remarkable
for
penetration
or
sagacity
but
he
was
a
kindly
man
where
his
own
ease
and
comfort
were
not
in
question
and
if
his
words
were
sometimes
weak
and
ineffective
he
could
when
required
put
on
a
very
wise
and
solemn
air
which
in
itself
was
a
comfort
to
those
who
sought
his
advice
but
he
really
did
not
see
what
advice
he
could
give
now
i
was
myself
he
said
more
surprised
and
hurt
than
i
can
tell
you
that
for
some
months
before
my
old
friend
death
i
was
denied
all
access
to
him
i
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
calling
at
the
hall
at
least
once
a
fortnight
ay
and
oftener
for
the
last
twenty
years
when
i
found
myself
rebuffed
one
time
after
another
i
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
the
squire
own
personal
wish
that
i
should
not
see
him
although
they
assured
me
it
was
so
old
aaron
would
usher
me
into
a
room
with
as
much
politeness
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
showing
to
anybody
and
would
take
in
my
message
back
he
would
come
or
else
jago
or
that
nurse
or
perhaps
hubert
stone
but
no
matter
who
came
each
had
the
same
tale
to
tell
the
squire
had
had
a
worse
night
than
usual
or
he
was
asleep
or
he
was
too
weak
to
see
anyone
whatever
the
excuse
might
be
i
was
never
allowed
to
see
him
it
was
the
source
of
very
considerable
pain
to
me
at
the
time
and
i
expressed
myself
rather
strongly
about
it
in
my
letters
to
maria
there
have
been
something
in
all
this
do
you
think
so
sir
returned
ella
something
to
conceal
it
seems
like
it
my
dear
it
used
to
seem
like
it
to
me
but
i
do
not
see
what
it
could
be
and
i
am
sure
i
can
not
imagine
anything
that
could
tend
to
peril
your
inheritance
nor
i
said
ella
i
wish
i
could
i
mean
i
wish
i
could
see
any
solution
by
which
these
doubts
could
be
set
at
rest
the
will
was
quite
in
order
daventry
tells
me
so
having
been
drawn
up
by
daventry
you
may
be
sure
of
that
my
dear
interrupted
the
vicar
the
only
one
thing
he
says
that
could
possibly
render
it
invalid
is
my
uncle
having
died
before
his
birthday
continued
ella
and
we
know
he
did
not
die
before
it
he
lived
nearly
a
month
after
it
i
suppose
he
did
live
spoke
ella
with
much
hesitation
did
live
echoed
the
vicar
in
surprise
why
of
course
he
did
people
saw
him
and
spoke
with
him
do
you
know
that
the
other
denison
lawyer
and
his
clerk
came
to
the
hall
two
or
three
days
subsequently
to
the
squire
birthday
and
had
an
interview
with
him
saw
him
conversed
with
him
how
could
they
have
done
that
had
he
not
been
living
the
squire
went
into
one
of
his
passions
it
was
said
dashed
his
cup
and
all
into
the
fire
and
abused
the
lawyer
to
his
face
ella
could
not
help
a
smile
yes
she
said
i
was
told
of
that
then
what
else
is
there
to
fear
for
anyone
to
come
to
you
and
say
that
if
certain
facts
were
known
to
the
world
you
would
not
be
mistress
of
heron
dyke
seems
to
me
sheer
nonsense
if
not
malice
were
i
in
your
place
my
dear
miss
winter
i
should
certainly
trouble
myself
no
further
in
the
matter
ella
shook
her
head
all
these
arguments
seem
so
cogent
so
true
and
yet
i
can
not
feel
satisfied
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
what
more
to
do
do
nothing
said
the
vicar
decisively
i
think
you
attach
an
exaggerated
importance
to
the
words
some
designing
rascal
it
must
have
been
who
spoke
them
wanting
to
swindle
money
out
of
you
give
him
into
custody
should
he
apply
again
remembering
how
impossible
it
was
that
he
could
apply
again
a
sad
shade
passed
over
ella
countenance
the
vicar
saw
it
and
of
course
mistook
it
he
knitted
his
brow
take
my
advice
my
dear
miss
winter
and
rest
satisfied
he
said
do
not
try
to
create
a
mystery
where
none
exists
save
in
your
own
imagination
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
the
vicar
reasoning
and
advice
had
been
much
like
daventry
ella
wished
she
could
feel
as
secure
as
they
felt
she
and
maria
went
out
together
they
were
going
to
the
leaning
gate
as
it
was
now
decided
that
the
fever
of
betsy
tucker
was
not
an
infectious
one
and
as
the
girl
was
said
to
be
getting
weaker
miss
winter
considered
it
was
her
duty
to
go
to
see
her
maria
had
been
more
than
once
what
do
you
think
maria
of
the
advice
your
father
gave
me
to
let
this
doubt
as
to
my
inheritance
rest
and
be
satisfied
questioned
ella
as
they
walked
along
oh
that
i
could
see
my
way
to
a
little
more
light
light
does
not
always
come
when
we
ask
for
it
or
when
we
fancy
that
we
need
it
most
answered
maria
and
yet
it
generally
comes
at
the
time
that
is
best
for
us
you
must
hope
that
it
will
do
so
in
the
present
case
that
is
if
you
still
feel
there
is
something
hidden
that
you
ought
to
know
that
is
just
the
feeling
which
i
can
not
get
rid
of
were
you
in
my
place
maria
what
would
you
do
i
hardly
know
answered
maria
slowly
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
bound
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
in
your
efforts
to
discover
the
truth
and
this
none
the
less
perhaps
indeed
rather
the
more
that
the
truth
when
revealed
may
prove
disastrous
to
you
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
i
can
only
wait
for
more
light
said
ella
with
a
sigh
the
difficulty
is
how
to
get
the
light
where
to
look
for
it
i
perceive
that
said
maria
you
can
but
wait
and
watch
here
we
are
and
there
poor
mrs
keen
betsy
tucker
was
in
bed
the
victim
of
a
distressing
kind
of
low
fever
spreckley
hoped
to
bring
her
through
it
but
he
was
not
sanguine
after
turning
and
tossing
for
hours
incessantly
mrs
keen
informed
them
she
had
now
sunk
into
a
troubled
sleep
they
stood
by
the
bed
in
silence
looking
at
the
sick
girl
cheeks
she
is
at
times
whispered
the
landlady
fancying
herself
back
at
the
hall
she
starts
up
in
bed
turning
to
miss
winter
crying
out
there
are
the
footsteps
in
the
corridor
again
and
now
she
go
on
are
trying
the
door
see
see
the
handle
moves
and
with
that
she
sinks
back
on
the
pillow
and
buries
her
head
under
the
clothes
for
my
part
concluded
mrs
keen
i
can
not
help
thinking
it
was
that
fright
which
has
brought
on
the
fever
to
what
do
you
allude
asked
miss
winter
has
she
been
frightened
why
yes
but
i
thought
you
knew
of
it
or
i
not
have
spoken
it
was
talked
of
a
good
deal
at
the
hall
she
was
badly
frightened
in
what
way
it
was
the
night
of
the
storm
a
few
weeks
ago
replied
the
landlady
vexed
to
have
alluded
to
this
before
miss
winter
as
it
seemed
she
did
not
know
of
it
betsy
could
not
get
to
sleep
for
the
noise
and
between
the
gusts
of
wind
when
all
was
momentarily
still
she
heard
footsteps
walking
about
the
corridor
outside
her
bedroom
door
after
a
time
she
struck
a
light
and
then
so
she
says
she
distinctly
saw
the
handle
of
her
room
door
turn
this
way
and
that
as
though
somebody
was
trying
to
get
in
but
she
had
locked
it
on
going
to
bed
she
came
down
here
to
tell
me
of
it
the
next
day
and
i
tried
to
persuade
her
that
it
was
nothing
more
than
her
own
idle
fancies
that
had
frightened
her
till
at
last
she
got
quite
out
of
temper
with
me
it
must
have
taken
great
hold
of
her
mind
i
afraid
by
the
way
she
talks
of
it
in
her
wanderings
now
i
never
heard
anything
of
this
remarked
miss
winter
but
i
can
not
understand
why
betsy
need
have
been
so
much
frightened
she
might
have
guessed
that
the
footsteps
were
but
those
of
one
or
other
of
the
maids
unable
to
sleep
for
the
storm
and
what
more
natural
than
that
they
should
turn
the
handle
of
her
door
intending
to
keep
betsy
company
yes
assented
mrs
keen
looking
down
if
i
were
to
allow
myself
to
be
frightened
by
all
the
unaccountable
noises
i
hear
in
the
night
at
the
hall
especially
when
the
wind
is
high
i
should
never
care
to
sleep
there
again
continued
miss
winter
i
have
no
doubt
that
all
old
houses
are
alike
in
that
respect
especially
when
many
of
the
rooms
are
empty
where
is
susan
interposed
maria
breaking
the
pause
of
silence
she
is
gone
out
to
do
some
errands
miss
maria
susan
is
a
famous
help
to
me
in
nursing
betsy
susan
was
always
very
gentle
and
patient
remarked
ella
and
always
will
be
i
hope
responded
mrs
keen
she
is
a
girl
that
has
very
little
to
say
for
herself
as
you
know
young
ladies
on
most
points
she
seems
as
sensible
as
other
people
are
but
now
and
then
her
mind
seems
to
go
vacant
just
as
if
it
could
quite
grasp
what
you
are
telling
her
and
her
memory
is
not
always
to
be
trusted
but
she
a
dear
good
girl
in
helping
me
in
the
house
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
her
does
her
sister
disappearance
seem
to
prey
upon
her
mind
as
much
as
it
used
to
do
and
miss
winter
unconsciously
lowered
her
voice
as
she
put
the
question
i
do
believe
it
is
ever
out
of
her
thoughts
answered
the
landlady
i
know
quite
well
what
susan
is
thinking
about
when
she
sits
perfectly
still
as
she
will
sometimes
do
for
together
staring
straight
before
her
but
without
seeing
anything
katherine
name
is
never
mentioned
in
her
presence
now
i
think
it
best
continued
mrs
keen
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
though
heaven
knows
my
poor
lost
darling
is
rarely
out
of
my
thoughts
you
will
of
course
see
that
betsy
tucker
wants
for
nothing
mrs
keen
said
miss
winter
as
the
landlady
attended
the
young
ladies
to
the
door
i
was
very
much
vexed
as
i
have
already
told
you
that
she
should
have
been
sent
away
from
the
hall
she
should
not
have
been
had
i
been
at
home
everything
requisite
for
her
shall
be
sent
to
her
from
my
house
and
one
of
the
maids
shall
come
this
evening
to
watch
by
her
for
the
night
we
must
not
have
you
laid
up
oh
please
do
think
of
me
i
am
strong
and
used
to
work
all
my
anxiety
is
lest
we
should
not
bring
her
through
spreckley
assures
me
that
he
has
still
good
hopes
of
her
and
he
is
you
know
skilful
and
attentive
ella
glanced
at
the
little
garden
as
they
left
the
door
that
which
had
looked
so
bright
and
pleasant
in
the
summer
had
now
little
to
show
in
the
faint
november
sunshine
but
bare
branches
empty
beds
and
footpaths
strewed
with
withered
leaves
i
think
mrs
keen
must
be
mistaken
in
fancying
betsy
tucker
illness
has
arisen
from
the
fright
she
got
the
night
of
the
storm
observed
miss
winter
after
they
had
walked
some
little
time
in
silence
it
is
incredible
that
the
mere
hearing
of
footsteps
in
the
corridor
and
seeing
her
door
tried
should
have
terrified
her
to
any
extent
her
own
sense
ought
to
have
told
her
that
what
she
heard
was
merely
the
footsteps
of
some
of
the
other
maids
who
could
not
rest
on
account
of
the
storm
the
girl
was
very
much
frightened
at
the
time
i
believe
said
miss
kettle
though
there
can
be
little
doubt
the
impression
would
have
worn
off
but
for
something
which
she
unfortunately
heard
a
day
or
two
later
two
of
the
others
were
conversing
about
it
not
knowing
that
she
was
within
hearing
they
said
to
one
another
that
it
must
have
been
the
ghost
walking
at
night
the
ghost
of
katherine
keen
miss
winter
brow
knit
angrily
who
were
those
servants
eliza
and
phemie
they
had
carefully
kept
it
from
the
girl
and
her
hearing
it
was
quite
an
accident
betsy
it
appears
believes
in
ghosts
and
she
confessed
to
mrs
keen
she
had
never
had
one
proper
night
rest
since
from
fright
i
suppose
mrs
keen
told
you
this
maria
yes
the
first
time
i
went
to
see
betsy
miss
winter
sighed
i
do
not
see
what
help
there
is
for
it
the
whole
affair
remains
as
unaccountable
as
ever
it
was
unaccountable
indeed
replied
maria
gravely
at
times
when
speaking
of
it
or
hearing
it
spoken
of
i
turn
shivery
as
if
i
believed
in
the
ghost
myself
here
comes
susan
the
young
girl
pleasant
and
was
advancing
with
a
basket
of
marketings
they
stopped
to
speak
to
her
miss
winter
told
her
she
was
going
to
send
one
of
the
maids
down
to
sit
up
with
betsy
and
was
passing
onwards
when
the
anxious
appealing
look
in
the
girl
wan
face
arrested
her
did
you
wish
to
ask
anything
susan
oh
if
i
might
if
i
might
certainly
you
may
what
is
it
i
want
to
find
out
where
they
took
katherine
to
spoke
the
girl
in
an
urgent
whisper
perhaps
you
know
you
are
the
mistress
and
whether
she
is
alive
or
dead
my
poor
susan
i
know
no
more
about
it
than
you
do
i
wish
i
did
susan
clasped
her
hands
i
wonder
how
much
longer
we
shall
have
to
wait
it
may
be
susan
that
we
shall
never
know
it
may
be
intended
that
we
shall
not
know
susan
shook
her
head
i
think
it
will
all
be
known
perhaps
i
shall
be
the
one
to
find
it
out
i
often
wake
up
in
the
night
and
hear
katherine
calling
to
me
only
i
ca
tell
where
the
voice
comes
from
i
hear
it
oftenest
in
the
larch
plantation
at
the
back
of
the
hall
when
the
moon
is
at
the
full
but
when
i
try
to
follow
her
voice
i
get
bewildered
with
the
strange
fancies
that
seem
to
be
dancing
and
whirling
in
my
head
and
sometimes
i
hear
a
laugh
close
behind
me
and
then
i
hurry
off
home
and
go
to
bed
and
repeat
hymns
one
after
another
till
i
get
to
sleep
there
run
home
now
susan
your
mother
is
waiting
for
you
interposed
miss
kettle
with
authority
for
it
was
always
best
to
cut
off
promptly
these
dreamy
visions
of
susan
ever
obedient
susan
hastened
towards
the
leaning
gate
the
spiritual
expression
dying
out
of
her
eyes
the
others
walked
on
maria
with
her
gaze
on
the
ground
look
opposite
maria
there
is
some
one
you
know
maria
looked
across
the
road
and
saw
philip
cleeve
who
appeared
to
be
just
as
much
absorbed
as
they
were
his
head
bent
in
deep
thought
he
looked
like
philip
grown
twenty
years
older
philip
without
his
elastic
tread
his
quick
walk
his
cheerful
smile
and
greeting
for
everyone
whom
he
knew
not
until
he
had
nearly
passed
did
he
perceive
miss
winter
and
maria
happening
to
raise
his
eyes
he
started
hesitated
flushed
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
lifted
his
hat
and
hurried
on
maria
too
flushed
painfully
and
a
grieved
look
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
gravely
acknowledged
philip
salutation
and
walked
on
by
miss
winter
side
you
and
philip
have
not
quarrelled
i
hope
maria
quarrelled
no
answered
maria
with
a
sigh
but
he
does
not
come
to
the
vicarage
now
papa
has
forbidden
it
he
looks
changed
somehow
so
i
think
he
spends
i
believe
too
much
time
in
the
and
report
talks
of
high
play
at
the
lilacs
with
lord
camberley
and
others
all
these
things
distress
me
greatly
naturally
if
you
feel
a
special
interest
in
him
remarked
ella
again
maria
colour
deepened
just
before
i
went
to
leamington
he
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
did
you
refuse
him
for
the
time
being
and
you
have
not
yet
made
up
your
mind
to
accept
him
no
how
can
i
i
could
never
make
up
my
mind
unless
papa
will
went
with
it
perhaps
philip
is
vexed
disheartened
and
so
flies
to
these
foolish
courses
i
do
know
sighed
maria
it
would
show
great
weakness
of
mind
would
it
not
people
in
love
are
said
to
be
not
always
accountable
for
their
actions
poor
philip
but
you
love
him
still
i
never
quite
knew
till
lately
what
he
is
to
me
answered
maria
in
a
low
voice
i
have
tried
not
to
care
for
him
but
you
find
that
you
too
are
a
little
i
suppose
so
but
he
never
passed
me
in
the
street
before
without
speaking
chapter
iii
malachite
and
gold
of
all
days
in
the
week
saturday
was
the
one
most
longed
for
by
ella
winter
the
reason
was
that
it
always
or
nearly
always
for
now
and
then
there
was
a
breakdown
or
a
delay
somewhere
brought
her
a
letter
from
edward
conroy
these
letters
were
her
greatest
comfort
in
her
perplexities
and
troubles
she
read
them
and
them
till
she
knew
all
their
sweetest
passages
by
heart
how
she
longed
for
his
return
that
she
might
tell
him
everything
for
in
truth
she
sometimes
felt
that
the
burden
laid
upon
her
was
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
without
help
were
he
but
here
to
share
it
with
her
absence
had
enabled
her
to
read
her
heart
in
all
its
entirety
had
endeared
his
image
to
her
more
day
by
day
conroy
was
not
expected
in
england
until
spring
but
towards
the
end
of
november
there
came
a
letter
the
contents
of
which
filled
his
mistress
with
unexpected
delight
conroy
mission
in
spain
was
nearly
at
an
end
and
he
might
be
expected
home
in
three
or
four
weeks
in
time
it
might
be
to
eat
his
christmas
dinner
he
did
not
tell
her
that
latterly
her
letters
had
filled
him
with
so
much
uneasiness
that
he
had
requested
his
employers
to
relieve
him
of
his
duties
abroad
or
that
he
had
wisely
made
up
his
mind
to
ascertain
for
himself
and
as
quickly
as
possible
the
exact
state
of
affairs
at
heron
dyke
little
by
little
the
popular
excitement
in
connection
with
the
murder
and
robbery
at
heron
dyke
began
to
subside
especially
as
all
the
efforts
of
the
police
resulted
in
no
fresh
discoveries
people
had
talked
and
wondered
till
there
was
nothing
left
to
talk
and
wonder
about
fresh
topics
and
other
interests
began
to
claim
their
attention
the
newspapers
had
ceased
to
comment
on
the
case
and
there
seemed
every
probability
of
its
adding
one
more
to
the
long
list
of
undiscovered
crimes
one
day
toynbee
who
had
been
shopping
in
the
town
brought
home
a
piece
of
news
some
one
had
told
her
that
jago
was
about
to
leave
nullington
the
reason
for
his
departure
being
that
he
had
bought
a
more
lucrative
practice
elsewhere
this
set
ella
thinking
would
it
not
be
well
she
asked
herself
to
see
this
man
before
he
went
away
and
try
whether
she
could
not
elicit
from
him
something
of
that
which
she
wanted
to
know
he
had
attended
her
uncle
to
the
last
he
must
be
acquainted
with
all
that
took
place
inside
heron
dyke
during
the
time
she
was
away
if
any
fraud
had
been
at
work
it
could
hardly
have
been
kept
a
secret
from
him
she
disliked
jago
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
ought
not
to
let
him
go
away
without
seeking
an
interview
with
him
next
morning
she
finally
made
up
her
mind
so
the
was
ordered
round
and
she
was
driven
into
nullington
calling
at
the
vicarage
on
her
way
she
took
miss
kettle
into
her
confidence
am
i
doing
right
maria
think
you
yes
i
think
you
are
then
you
must
accompany
me
you
have
no
objection
not
the
least
in
the
world
jago
was
at
home
and
the
young
ladies
leaving
the
carriage
with
the
groom
were
shown
into
his
turning
round
from
a
case
he
was
packing
the
doctor
changed
colour
as
if
from
annoyance
when
he
saw
his
visitors
the
transitory
expression
passed
however
he
greeted
them
civilly
apologising
for
the
disorder
of
the
place
and
invited
them
to
sit
i
hear
that
you
are
about
to
quit
nullington
jago
began
miss
winter
as
she
took
the
chair
he
placed
true
madam
he
replied
i
have
purchased
a
more
lucrative
practice
in
london
what
can
i
have
the
honour
of
doing
for
you
i
have
called
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
jago
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
answer
them
the
doctor
bowed
i
was
abroad
as
you
are
aware
at
the
time
my
uncle
died
she
began
but
you
saw
him
i
believe
in
your
medical
capacity
up
to
the
day
of
his
death
yes
he
replied
i
saw
denison
daily
and
i
was
with
him
when
he
died
the
end
when
it
did
come
was
very
sudden
both
sudden
and
unexpected
returned
the
doctor
i
was
utterly
taken
by
surprise
i
knew
of
course
that
denison
disorder
could
have
but
one
termination
but
i
had
no
thought
that
the
end
was
so
near
the
heart
suddenly
failed
in
its
action
and
and
all
was
over
only
a
few
hours
before
when
i
was
with
him
i
had
detected
no
cause
for
fear
you
are
aware
that
previously
to
last
christmas
in
october
i
think
it
was
spreckley
who
had
attended
my
uncle
for
twenty
years
and
who
ought
to
have
known
his
constitution
if
it
were
possible
for
anyone
to
know
it
gave
it
as
his
decided
opinion
that
denison
could
not
live
far
into
the
new
year
if
so
long
as
that
denison
himself
informed
me
of
that
opinion
and
yet
your
skill
prolonged
his
life
until
nearly
the
end
of
may
jago
bowed
again
but
said
nothing
then
you
although
a
much
younger
practitioner
than
spreckley
must
have
pursued
a
very
much
more
efficient
mode
of
treatment
with
your
patient
than
that
adopted
by
him
jago
shrugged
his
shoulders
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
and
smiled
faintly
i
have
not
the
slightest
wish
in
the
world
to
disparage
spreckley
he
said
but
it
may
be
that
he
is
a
little
in
his
ideas
it
may
be
that
he
has
hardly
grown
with
the
times
medicine
has
made
great
strides
during
the
last
twenty
years
and
a
country
practitioner
unless
he
be
a
great
reader
and
a
man
of
inquiring
mind
would
find
many
things
taught
and
many
theories
demonstrated
in
the
schools
of
london
and
paris
which
were
hardly
as
much
as
mooted
when
he
was
a
young
man
all
this
seemed
only
fair
and
reasonable
in
any
case
miss
winter
was
not
prepared
to
refute
it
she
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
before
she
spoke
again
it
may
or
it
may
not
have
come
to
your
notice
jago
she
said
eyeing
him
steadily
as
she
spoke
that
there
are
certain
reports
flying
about
the
neighbourhood
reports
unpleasant
to
all
concerned
but
which
you
could
no
doubt
put
an
end
to
if
you
chose
to
do
so
reports
about
what
miss
winter
he
asked
quickly
ella
paused
it
seemed
somewhat
difficult
to
frame
words
for
what
she
wanted
to
say
i
hardly
know
how
to
put
it
she
said
with
a
frank
smile
people
have
in
some
way
picked
up
a
notion
that
there
was
some
deceit
or
fraud
at
work
in
connection
with
my
uncle
death
oh
have
they
was
all
the
answer
the
doctor
made
speaking
carelessly
it
is
said
that
for
some
months
before
denison
died
he
was
immured
away
from
everyone
except
three
or
four
people
that
he
was
kept
under
lock
and
key
that
all
his
old
friends
were
denied
access
to
him
also
that
at
the
very
time
my
letters
from
home
informed
me
he
was
growing
stronger
day
by
day
and
week
by
week
a
strange
woman
some
london
nurse
was
in
the
house
in
regular
attendance
on
him
people
naturally
ask
why
there
should
have
been
all
this
mystery
unless
there
was
something
to
hide
they
even
go
so
far
as
to
hint
that
the
master
of
heron
dyke
did
not
live
to
see
his
seventieth
birthday
jago
despite
his
evident
efforts
could
not
avoid
changing
countenance
as
miss
winter
spoke
his
face
turned
sallow
his
eyes
fell
suddenly
he
rose
and
opened
the
door
is
that
you
james
he
called
out
but
no
one
answered
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
resuming
his
seat
and
quite
calm
now
i
thought
i
heard
my
servant
knock
about
this
business
miss
winter
if
one
were
to
take
heed
of
all
the
idle
tales
set
afloat
by
ignorant
and
foolish
people
one
would
have
little
else
to
do
the
late
denison
was
an
eccentric
man
in
many
ways
as
you
yourself
must
be
well
aware
he
was
a
man
of
strong
individuality
and
of
crotchety
temper
a
man
who
did
very
few
things
in
quite
the
same
way
as
ordinary
people
do
them
there
were
besides
certain
peculiar
features
in
connection
with
the
disposition
of
his
property
which
were
well
known
in
the
neighbourhood
and
which
acted
as
a
magnet
to
the
curiosity
of
the
world
these
points
being
granted
we
have
at
once
a
foundation
for
the
most
ridiculous
fancies
and
the
most
exaggerated
gossip
but
if
we
quietly
set
ourselves
to
sift
these
rumours
what
do
we
find
ella
did
not
speak
if
you
will
allow
me
miss
winter
i
will
take
the
case
as
stated
in
your
own
words
you
say
that
for
some
months
before
denison
died
he
was
immured
away
from
everyone
except
three
or
four
people
and
kept
as
it
were
under
lock
and
key
granted
but
it
was
done
entirely
at
his
own
request
you
perhaps
remember
something
of
that
queer
crotchet
he
had
in
his
head
that
the
precincts
of
the
hall
and
even
the
hall
itself
were
haunted
by
spies
set
on
to
watch
him
by
certain
people
his
relatives
i
believe
but
of
that
i
know
little
this
notion
seemed
to
take
fuller
hold
of
him
as
his
birthday
drew
nearer
he
insisted
on
having
his
rooms
shut
in
from
the
rest
of
the
house
he
decreed
that
only
a
very
few
individuals
those
whom
he
could
implicitly
trust
should
have
access
to
him
none
of
the
ordinary
servants
were
to
go
near
him
for
aught
he
knew
he
would
declare
they
might
be
spies
it
was
an
hallucination
i
combated
as
far
as
i
was
able
but
contradiction
especially
on
this
point
only
irritated
him
more
than
once
it
brought
on
one
of
his
fits
of
passion
and
so
undid
or
partially
undid
the
good
i
was
striving
to
do
him
in
other
ways
this
was
quite
feasible
probably
true
and
miss
winter
bowed
her
head
in
acquiescence
the
doctor
resumed
as
regards
denison
old
friends
being
denied
access
to
him
i
must
take
on
myself
a
certain
measure
of
blame
for
what
may
seem
a
somewhat
arbitrary
proceeding
from
the
first
i
gave
denison
to
understand
that
if
he
adopted
my
mode
of
treatment
perfect
quiet
and
seclusion
were
essential
to
its
success
and
he
agreed
with
me
without
the
slightest
demur
but
i
did
not
at
first
deny
him
the
sight
of
friends
it
was
only
after
the
visits
of
some
of
them
when
i
saw
how
much
it
excited
him
that
i
was
obliged
to
do
so
i
begged
him
to
allow
his
rooms
to
be
closed
to
all
visitors
had
he
admitted
one
he
must
have
admitted
others
i
showed
him
how
essential
it
was
that
he
should
be
kept
strictly
perfectly
quiet
and
he
agreed
he
would
agree
to
anything
he
said
if
i
could
only
succeed
in
keeping
him
alive
over
his
seventieth
birthday
and
i
certainly
did
succeed
in
doing
that
did
he
require
the
services
of
a
nurse
undoubtedly
and
was
it
necessary
that
she
should
be
a
stranger
in
my
opinion
he
ought
to
have
been
supplied
with
a
properly
trained
nurse
long
before
i
sent
for
one
an
old
woman
had
in
haphazard
from
the
neighbourhood
would
have
been
useless
no
one
except
we
medical
men
and
those
invalids
who
have
tried
them
know
how
invaluable
is
a
really
qualified
nurse
in
a
i
believe
that
said
ella
hastily
but
why
was
it
that
the
fact
of
this
nurse
having
been
at
heron
dyke
was
never
mentioned
to
me
neither
in
the
letters
i
received
from
home
nor
when
i
returned
to
it
close
upon
the
departure
of
the
nurse
was
she
as
much
as
named
to
me
jago
shook
his
head
i
can
not
enlighten
you
there
he
answered
did
not
keep
the
fact
from
you
i
neither
wrote
you
letters
nor
saw
you
on
your
return
there
could
be
no
reason
whatever
so
far
as
i
know
why
you
should
not
have
been
privy
to
it
what
reason
could
there
be
possibly
it
may
have
been
one
of
old
aaron
crotchets
for
he
had
as
many
as
his
master
that
you
should
not
be
told
possibly
it
had
been
but
miss
winter
still
felt
in
a
fog
plausible
though
all
this
was
can
you
assure
me
jago
that
the
seeing
one
or
two
of
his
oldest
friends
would
have
been
absolutely
detrimental
to
my
uncle
say
for
instance
the
vicar
papa
thought
it
very
strange
he
thinks
it
so
still
that
he
was
always
denied
admittance
interposed
maria
speaking
for
the
first
time
and
the
doctor
turned
sharply
to
her
with
a
slight
frown
as
though
he
had
forgotten
her
presence
i
can
not
say
it
would
have
been
fatally
detrimental
but
it
might
have
been
he
observed
in
answer
to
miss
winter
he
himself
knew
the
danger
of
excitement
and
he
was
as
anxious
as
i
was
to
guard
against
the
possibility
of
it
with
regard
to
the
other
report
you
have
mentioned
miss
winter
that
denison
did
not
live
over
his
seventieth
birthday
it
is
upon
my
word
too
ridiculous
a
one
to
refute
denison
was
seen
by
many
people
later
and
talked
with
talked
with
face
to
face
webb
the
lawyer
saw
him
and
spoke
with
him
about
his
will
those
other
lawyers
men
from
london
had
an
interview
with
him
he
was
seen
by
no
end
of
people
musicians
and
others
on
his
birthday
night
in
the
face
of
these
facts
how
is
it
possible
pardon
me
the
remark
miss
winter
for
you
to
give
ear
for
a
moment
to
so
absurd
a
rumour
she
sat
in
thought
not
answering
where
was
the
deception
where
the
fraud
he
resumed
indeed
where
was
the
necessity
for
employing
any
the
great
object
of
life
was
attained
he
had
outlived
his
seventieth
birthday
and
the
property
was
his
own
to
will
away
fraud
it
is
an
assertion
that
brings
with
it
its
own
contradiction
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
nothing
more
evidently
to
be
learned
from
jago
and
with
civil
adieux
on
both
sides
the
ladies
took
their
departure
the
doctor
attending
them
to
the
and
handing
them
into
it
at
that
moment
spreckley
passed
on
horseback
he
stared
profoundly
as
much
as
to
say
what
on
earth
do
you
do
at
that
man
house
and
he
almost
forgot
to
salute
them
miss
winter
sat
in
deep
thought
as
they
drove
away
that
jago
had
displayed
nervousness
not
to
say
agitation
when
spoken
to
she
had
not
failed
to
observe
it
had
served
to
deepen
her
conviction
that
something
was
hidden
which
it
was
intended
that
she
of
all
people
in
the
world
should
never
know
and
although
his
assertions
afterwards
had
seemed
perfectly
reasonable
and
convincing
she
could
not
get
rid
of
an
uneasy
suspicion
that
the
doctor
metaphorically
speaking
had
been
throwing
dust
in
her
eyes
any
way
she
was
as
far
off
as
ever
if
not
farther
from
arriving
at
the
truth
what
do
you
think
of
dr
jago
she
abruptly
asked
maria
i
do
like
him
at
all
ella
his
words
are
plausible
enough
indeed
too
plausible
but
he
seems
thoroughly
insincere
he
is
a
man
whom
i
should
always
mistrust
have
you
questioned
your
servants
only
old
aaron
and
i
can
get
nothing
from
him
his
reasoning
is
in
substance
the
same
as
jago
maria
i
feel
that
some
trickery
was
at
work
i
should
ask
the
maids
phemie
and
eliza
whether
they
noticed
anything
strange
they
must
have
been
about
the
house
much
during
all
the
time
i
think
i
will
it
has
crossed
my
mind
to
do
so
but
i
feared
they
would
only
make
my
questions
into
a
source
of
gossip
miss
kettle
paused
tell
me
exactly
what
it
is
that
you
suspect
i
do
not
know
what
to
suspect
except
that
i
have
a
strong
idea
of
some
unfair
play
having
been
enacted
there
lies
my
difficulty
but
that
it
seems
so
impossible
and
so
dreadful
an
idea
besides
i
might
say
that
my
uncle
did
live
to
see
his
birthday
maria
shivered
slightly
oh
ella
it
is
the
bent
my
fears
are
taking
whispered
miss
winter
and
in
that
case
you
know
i
am
not
the
owner
of
heron
dyke
no
no
ella
i
can
not
believe
that
said
maria
your
fears
are
making
you
fanciful
that
same
evening
miss
winter
had
the
two
maids
phemie
and
eliza
before
her
and
questioned
them
of
matters
respecting
the
last
illness
what
they
had
to
tell
was
little
more
than
she
had
heard
from
priscilla
peyton
for
several
weeks
or
months
previously
to
the
april
no
one
in
the
house
except
the
four
people
who
were
admitted
behind
the
green
baize
doors
ever
saw
or
heard
anything
of
the
squire
had
you
reason
to
think
he
was
ill
asked
miss
winter
we
could
tell
nothing
replied
phemie
he
might
have
been
dead
and
buried
for
weeks
and
weeks
for
all
we
saw
or
heard
of
him
eliza
and
i
used
to
say
how
strange
it
was
often
we
listened
often
and
often
but
never
got
to
hear
him
never
so
much
as
heard
him
cough
before
that
dexter
came
in
november
i
sometimes
took
his
sago
or
his
to
him
but
never
afterwards
how
was
it
that
you
never
mentioned
to
me
that
dexter
had
been
here
was
it
accident
no
it
was
aaron
and
miss
winter
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
turn
of
the
sentence
the
day
before
you
were
expected
home
he
ordered
all
in
the
house
not
to
talk
of
dexter
he
thought
it
might
trouble
you
to
hear
that
the
squire
was
so
ill
as
to
need
a
nurse
from
london
i
suppose
you
never
penetrated
beyond
the
green
baize
doors
after
they
were
put
up
phemie
glanced
at
her
eliza
did
once
you
had
better
tell
of
it
eliza
tell
me
all
eliza
do
not
be
afraid
said
miss
winter
kindly
for
the
girl
looked
confused
if
you
please
i
was
in
the
passage
one
day
and
saw
both
the
doors
on
the
jar
began
eliza
i
thought
it
no
harm
to
go
in
a
few
steps
but
i
went
cautiously
thinking
stone
must
be
there
however
i
saw
nobody
and
then
i
thought
dexter
must
have
left
them
open
by
mistake
before
she
went
out
she
had
gone
into
nullington
in
a
hurry
saying
she
must
see
dr
jago
well
go
on
eliza
i
ventured
in
a
little
farther
and
a
little
farther
continued
eliza
speaking
freely
now
everything
was
silent
i
said
to
myself
that
perhaps
the
squire
was
asleep
and
then
i
thought
that
i
should
like
to
see
him
once
again
the
first
room
i
came
to
was
dexter
it
had
been
made
into
a
chamber
for
her
i
turned
the
handle
softly
pushed
open
the
door
and
peeped
in
there
was
her
bed
in
one
corner
and
by
the
was
her
little
round
table
and
an
from
this
room
i
went
to
the
next
which
was
the
door
opened
without
making
any
noise
i
peeped
in
there
was
no
one
there
the
squire
chair
stood
by
the
hearth
but
it
was
empty
and
there
was
no
fire
in
the
grate
it
had
the
look
of
a
room
that
had
not
been
occupied
for
ever
so
long
and
somehow
i
turned
away
with
a
chill
at
my
heart
the
next
room
was
the
bedroom
i
do
think
i
should
have
ventured
to
open
the
door
of
this
but
i
found
it
open
already
it
was
standing
ajar
i
listened
for
the
sound
of
denison
breathing
supposing
that
he
was
asleep
but
i
could
hear
nothing
then
i
pushed
the
door
a
little
further
open
and
looked
in
if
you
believe
me
he
was
not
there
no
one
was
there
he
must
have
been
somewhere
in
the
room
eliza
he
was
not
indeed
the
room
was
empty
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
i
walked
across
it
to
the
window
and
back
again
the
room
was
all
tidy
like
one
that
is
not
in
use
not
as
much
as
a
book
was
about
or
a
chair
out
of
place
the
bed
was
made
and
the
curtains
folded
upon
it
this
news
sounded
wonderful
ella
could
not
speak
i
felt
quite
frightened
i
said
to
myself
what
has
become
of
the
master
and
i
ca
fathom
the
mystery
of
where
he
could
be
to
this
day
there
was
a
room
beyond
my
uncle
a
dark
unused
room
spoke
miss
winter
did
you
enter
that
no
i
tried
the
door
of
it
but
it
was
locked
and
the
key
gone
but
the
squire
would
not
be
in
there
in
a
i
said
to
phemie
afterwards
eliza
stopped
suddenly
and
coloured
her
mistress
bade
her
continue
well
when
i
was
telling
phemie
of
this
strange
thing
i
said
to
her
that
the
thought
had
come
over
me
when
i
saw
the
empty
bed
and
no
trace
of
him
in
the
room
that
it
looked
just
as
if
the
master
had
been
spirited
away
like
katherine
keen
to
this
miss
winter
said
nothing
was
it
discovered
that
you
had
been
in
she
asked
no
never
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
talked
of
it
except
to
phemie
i
pulled
the
baize
doors
to
after
me
when
i
came
out
and
they
shut
with
a
snap
back
came
dexter
she
asked
at
once
in
the
kitchen
for
the
squire
and
took
it
away
with
her
but
what
i
can
not
imagine
is
where
the
squire
was
all
the
time
miss
winter
could
not
imagine
either
and
lost
herself
in
unfathomable
conjecture
after
a
few
more
questions
she
dismissed
the
maids
charging
them
not
to
speak
of
this
the
girl
betsy
tucker
grew
worse
rather
than
better
and
notwithstanding
all
that
skill
and
good
nursing
could
do
for
her
spreckley
began
to
despair
of
her
recovery
miss
winter
was
startled
one
afternoon
when
adèle
came
to
her
and
said
mrs
keen
was
asking
to
be
admitted
show
her
in
adèle
said
miss
winter
in
a
low
tone
she
was
afraid
the
girl
was
dead
no
and
i
do
think
she
is
any
worse
replied
the
landlady
in
answer
to
the
dread
question
if
anything
she
perhaps
a
little
better
she
do
wander
quite
so
much
and
that
i
take
to
be
a
good
sign
what
i
have
made
bold
to
interrupt
you
about
miss
ella
is
another
thing
sit
down
while
you
tell
it
me
said
ella
thank
you
this
morning
betsy
who
was
quite
herself
though
very
weak
asked
me
to
put
the
small
trunk
which
came
with
her
from
the
hall
upon
the
bed
so
that
she
might
find
something
began
mrs
keen
taking
the
chair
indicated
it
was
a
pocket
she
wanted
and
we
were
some
time
finding
it
what
with
her
hands
being
feeble
and
me
not
knowing
what
it
was
like
white
or
coloured
out
of
the
pocket
when
we
had
found
it
she
drew
this
tiny
packet
and
asked
me
would
i
take
it
myself
up
to
the
hall
and
give
it
safely
to
miss
winter
the
little
packet
was
neatly
folded
in
tied
round
with
narrow
pink
ribbon
ella
rather
wonderingly
opened
it
amidst
some
folds
of
cotton
wool
lay
a
gentleman
it
was
of
malachite
and
gold
of
curious
and
very
uncommon
workmanship
miss
winter
had
never
to
her
knowledge
seen
it
before
what
is
it
she
asked
why
do
you
bring
it
to
me
mrs
keen
the
landlady
explained
betsy
mind
is
in
trouble
about
it
miss
ella
she
began
in
great
trouble
it
seems
that
the
morning
poor
hubert
stone
was
found
betsy
after
all
was
quiet
and
the
police
and
other
people
had
gone
was
outside
there
she
saw
something
shining
on
the
gravel
and
picked
it
up
it
was
this
trinket
she
thought
it
very
lovely
she
tells
me
and
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
she
picked
it
up
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
thinking
it
would
be
a
pretty
present
for
her
sweetheart
who
is
no
other
than
david
beal
the
joiner
son
and
i
suspect
though
she
has
not
said
as
much
that
it
was
just
to
be
near
him
she
took
a
situation
over
here
very
possibly
assented
miss
winter
but
she
ought
not
to
have
concealed
or
kept
this
it
is
that
which
is
tormenting
her
now
she
could
rest
till
i
had
brought
it
to
you
and
told
you
all
the
girl
says
and
i
can
but
believe
her
that
in
the
night
when
she
was
in
bed
she
saw
the
wrong
she
had
done
and
repented
of
it
but
was
afraid
then
of
confessing
all
kinds
of
foolish
fancies
visit
us
in
the
night
as
you
know
miss
ella
and
she
says
an
idea
came
into
her
mind
that
if
she
confessed
what
she
had
done
and
produced
the
trinket
she
might
perhaps
be
accused
of
having
been
mixed
up
with
the
robbery
so
she
wrapped
and
tied
it
up
and
has
kept
it
hidden
in
her
pocket
till
now
all
her
cry
since
she
came
into
her
right
mind
is
miss
winter
will
but
forgive
me
yes
yes
tell
her
i
forgive
her
mrs
keen
it
seems
to
me
that
when
we
do
wrong
our
own
conscience
brings
to
us
our
worst
punishment
and
i
am
truly
glad
that
the
girl
is
getting
better
i
will
call
and
see
her
have
you
disclosed
this
to
anyone
or
shown
the
link
indeed
no
not
even
to
susan
it
was
not
my
place
to
do
so
keep
it
quite
secret
still
said
ella
for
aught
we
can
tell
this
link
may
afford
some
clue
to
elucidate
what
is
as
yet
so
dark
the
landlady
took
her
leave
and
ella
locked
the
trinket
safely
up
for
the
present
on
the
following
morning
toynbee
received
a
letter
calling
her
away
from
heron
dyke
her
sister
in
london
had
met
with
an
accident
and
begged
her
to
come
up
for
a
few
days
if
she
could
be
spared
go
by
all
means
said
ella
in
answer
to
toynbee
tearful
looks
as
she
put
the
letter
into
her
hand
take
the
train
lonely
well
perhaps
i
should
feel
a
little
lonely
under
recent
circumstances
if
left
to
myself
but
i
will
get
maria
kettle
to
stay
with
me
it
will
do
her
good
she
is
anything
but
well
maria
was
suffering
from
the
effects
of
a
severe
cold
caught
one
bitter
night
when
returning
home
from
visiting
a
sick
pensioner
ella
drove
to
the
vicarage
and
brought
her
away
maria
would
have
said
no
but
her
father
said
yes
the
next
day
she
seemed
not
at
all
better
but
very
poorly
and
feverish
whilst
ella
was
dressing
for
dinner
maria
came
to
her
room
asking
to
be
excused
from
dining
she
felt
hardly
well
enough
to
go
down
especially
as
they
should
not
be
alone
only
daventry
would
be
there
ella
had
met
him
that
morning
and
invited
him
to
come
she
was
uneasy
about
many
things
and
wanted
to
talk
to
him
you
shall
lie
down
here
maria
said
she
pushing
her
sofa
close
to
the
fire
and
have
some
tea
sent
up
adèle
shall
get
it
for
you
maria
lay
down
on
the
sofa
wrapping
a
shawl
about
her
head
and
drank
the
tea
after
that
she
fell
asleep
ella
was
glad
to
hear
it
as
it
left
her
evening
free
for
daventry
the
old
lawyer
took
his
departure
at
nine
for
a
few
minutes
ella
sat
over
the
fire
musing
on
the
advice
he
had
given
her
to
be
still
for
the
present
not
to
take
action
on
any
point
from
this
reverie
she
was
aroused
by
the
sharp
and
sudden
opening
of
the
door
maria
kettle
stood
there
staggering
in
rather
than
walking
her
face
white
her
eyes
full
of
terror
oh
ella
she
gasped
ella
sprang
to
her
feet
her
pulses
quivering
you
are
worse
maria
she
cried
sit
down
here
no
it
is
not
that
not
that
moaned
maria
sinking
back
in
the
large
but
recently
vacated
by
daventry
i
have
seen
katherine
keen
katherine
keen
breathed
ella
her
lips
suddenly
becoming
dry
impossible
i
should
have
said
the
same
myself
ten
minutes
ago
returned
the
sick
girl
as
she
strove
for
composure
but
when
i
tell
you
ella
that
i
have
seen
her
and
that
i
am
in
possession
of
my
senses
i
think
you
must
believe
me
ella
winter
shivered
as
though
a
cold
wind
were
passing
over
her
kneeling
down
she
put
her
arm
round
maria
waist
tell
me
about
it
she
whispered
i
got
warm
after
i
had
the
tea
and
soon
fell
fast
asleep
said
maria
in
a
voice
hushed
and
trembling
i
knew
nothing
more
until
i
awoke
suddenly
and
completely
with
the
strange
feeling
which
most
people
have
experienced
at
one
time
or
another
that
some
one
was
bending
over
me
my
eyes
opened
widely
as
though
of
their
own
accord
and
there
bending
down
and
gazing
earnestly
into
my
face
was
the
face
of
katherine
keen
maria
i
recognised
it
in
a
moment
the
room
was
bright
with
firelight
and
i
could
not
be
mistaken
there
was
the
fair
hair
with
the
soft
appealing
eyes
and
the
sad
and
serious
look
in
them
that
i
remember
so
well
did
you
speak
for
a
moment
or
two
we
gazed
at
each
other
then
i
think
my
lips
formed
her
name
but
whether
any
sound
came
from
them
i
can
not
tell
the
next
thing
i
knew
was
that
she
was
no
longer
there
i
started
up
and
saw
a
figure
vanish
through
the
open
doorway
and
the
door
close
noiselessly
behind
it
for
an
instant
i
thought
i
should
have
died
repeated
ella
mechanically
remembering
that
this
apparition
had
been
always
so
described
she
was
in
black
from
head
to
foot
something
black
covered
her
head
which
she
held
with
the
fingers
of
one
hand
under
the
chin
with
her
disappearance
i
sprang
to
the
door
opened
it
and
rushed
into
the
corridor
after
her
you
had
courage
maria
i
had
no
courage
i
was
too
terrified
to
remain
alone
and
was
hastening
to
you
she
was
not
to
be
seen
she
had
disappeared
a
lamp
was
burning
at
the
farther
end
of
the
passage
but
the
passage
was
quite
empty
quite
still
not
a
sound
in
it
save
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
oh
ella
i
have
heard
the
mysteries
of
heron
dyke
spoken
of
but
i
never
thought
to
witness
anything
myself
yes
heron
dyke
has
no
doubt
its
unhappy
mysteries
has
had
them
for
some
time
now
sighed
ella
catching
up
her
breath
with
a
sob
and
i
know
not
how
to
solve
them
chapter
iv
charles
plackett
is
puzzled
mind
ella
you
have
promised
to
come
to
me
in
london
during
the
autumn
and
to
stay
for
a
fortnight
at
least
had
been
last
words
to
her
niece
when
she
was
leaving
heron
dyke
and
in
making
the
promise
ella
winter
had
fully
intended
to
fulfil
it
but
the
autumn
was
drawing
to
a
close
christmas
would
be
here
before
long
and
the
visit
had
not
been
paid
circumstances
had
prevented
it
but
in
those
circumstances
there
seemed
to
be
a
lull
now
and
carlyon
took
advantage
of
it
she
wrote
a
pressing
letter
to
ella
the
cold
weather
was
setting
in
she
said
her
cough
was
becoming
troublesome
and
she
had
nearly
made
up
her
mind
to
go
to
hyères
but
nothing
would
induce
her
to
go
anywhere
until
she
had
seen
her
niece
again
by
return
of
post
carlyon
received
an
answer
ella
would
pay
the
visit
at
once
on
the
following
day
she
and
maria
kettle
whom
she
begged
leave
to
bring
with
her
would
quit
the
hall
for
bayswater
change
as
miss
winter
knew
would
be
good
for
maria
it
might
not
be
amiss
for
herself
truth
to
tell
miss
winter
had
been
more
disturbed
by
her
friend
positive
assertion
of
having
seen
katherine
keen
than
she
cared
to
acknowledge
even
to
her
own
mind
maria
kettle
had
a
fund
of
practical
good
sense
she
was
not
at
all
romantically
inclined
and
ella
could
not
her
account
strange
though
it
might
be
as
she
probably
would
have
done
that
of
an
uneducated
or
superstitious
person
maria
account
did
not
stand
alone
it
was
impossible
for
miss
winter
not
to
recall
how
strongly
it
was
corroborated
she
herself
had
never
forgotten
her
visit
to
katherine
room
when
she
found
the
face
of
the
so
mysteriously
covered
up
there
had
followed
the
positive
assertions
of
the
two
maids
ann
and
martha
that
they
had
seen
katherine
and
both
of
them
had
known
her
well
looking
down
at
them
over
the
balusters
of
the
gallery
after
that
came
fright
although
in
her
case
no
face
had
been
seen
but
only
the
presence
of
a
mysterious
something
which
had
brushed
past
her
in
the
dusk
and
vanished
neither
could
betsy
tucker
revelation
that
she
had
heard
footsteps
in
the
corridor
outside
her
bedroom
on
the
night
of
the
storm
and
had
seen
the
handle
of
her
door
turned
and
the
fright
to
the
girl
in
consequence
be
entirely
ignored
for
after
it
came
to
miss
winter
ears
she
had
made
inquiries
of
her
servants
and
could
not
learn
that
any
one
of
them
had
been
in
the
corridor
that
night
they
had
all
been
too
much
terrified
by
the
storm
they
declared
to
quit
their
beds
ella
did
not
would
not
think
much
of
this
incident
the
old
house
was
full
of
strange
noises
especially
in
stormy
weather
and
she
herself
by
giving
way
to
her
fancies
could
readily
have
got
into
the
way
of
believing
that
she
heard
footfalls
and
whispers
and
rustlings
for
which
she
could
not
account
almost
every
night
of
her
life
but
the
strange
assertion
made
by
maria
kettle
was
a
very
different
matter
ella
could
not
help
attaching
more
weight
to
it
than
to
all
that
had
gone
before
and
the
extraordinary
belief
of
poor
susan
keen
that
her
sister
was
alive
and
in
the
house
occurred
unpleasantly
to
her
mind
could
it
be
could
it
by
any
possibility
be
true
that
katherine
keen
was
still
alive
that
she
was
hiding
somewhere
in
the
old
hall
and
came
out
into
the
dark
corridors
on
occasion
to
frighten
people
was
it
in
very
truth
she
herself
and
not
her
spirit
that
had
been
seen
at
different
times
ella
heart
ached
as
it
had
never
ached
before
no
not
even
when
the
girl
disappeared
and
could
nowhere
be
found
though
from
that
day
life
had
never
been
quite
the
same
to
her
the
dreadful
uncertainty
as
to
what
had
become
of
katherine
had
added
tenfold
to
the
pain
of
losing
her
and
now
after
the
lapse
of
so
long
a
time
it
seemed
as
if
the
uncertainty
would
never
be
cleared
up
but
what
if
she
had
been
alive
all
this
time
alive
and
close
by
what
if
she
had
never
quitted
the
roof
of
the
hall
ella
winter
good
sense
urged
her
to
reject
such
a
theory
as
utterly
untenable
certain
difficulties
presenting
themselves
palpably
before
her
but
it
urged
her
equally
to
reject
that
other
theory
of
supernatural
visitations
between
the
two
she
knew
not
what
to
think
that
katherine
had
really
been
seen
the
evidence
seemed
conclusive
but
had
she
been
seen
in
the
flesh
or
in
the
spirit
when
a
problem
is
put
before
you
which
you
find
it
impossible
to
solve
however
anxious
to
do
so
it
is
sometimes
wise
to
lay
it
by
for
a
while
and
turn
the
attention
to
other
things
trusting
to
the
unforeseen
to
do
for
you
what
you
can
not
do
for
yourself
thus
did
ella
winter
in
the
present
case
she
was
puzzled
and
distressed
and
was
growing
a
little
bit
nervous
besides
appetite
failed
the
long
dark
nights
oppressed
her
sleep
gave
place
to
wakeful
restlessness
and
she
began
to
be
afraid
of
sleeping
alone
therefore
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
she
answered
carlyon
invitation
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
not
sorry
to
lose
sight
of
the
chimneys
of
heron
dyke
as
the
carriage
whirled
her
and
maria
kettle
away
to
the
station
carlyon
had
a
surprise
in
store
for
her
niece
as
ella
discovered
on
the
second
evening
after
her
arrival
in
london
knowing
her
fondness
for
company
but
being
herself
in
no
humour
to
enjoy
it
ella
had
pleaded
for
no
large
parties
during
her
stay
that
they
should
dine
quietly
and
spend
rational
evenings
to
this
carlyon
had
readily
agreed
stipulating
however
that
the
rule
should
be
relaxed
in
favour
of
two
or
three
people
who
might
be
called
friends
of
the
family
in
short
my
dear
carlyon
had
said
when
talking
of
it
the
day
of
ella
arrival
i
promise
not
to
introduce
you
to
a
single
stranger
except
one
except
one
repeated
ella
yes
except
one
a
very
nice
old
gentleman
who
is
between
sixty
and
seventy
years
old
you
wo
surely
object
to
ella
laughed
she
thought
she
must
not
hold
out
against
any
gentleman
of
that
age
but
rather
welcome
his
acquaintance
but
miss
winter
was
very
considerably
taken
aback
when
on
the
following
evening
her
aunt
led
her
up
to
a
little
lean
old
man
who
wore
the
attire
of
a
bygone
age
a
brown
wig
a
long
coat
and
curiously
cambric
linen
and
introduced
him
gilbert
denison
of
nunham
priors
for
a
moment
or
two
ella
could
find
no
word
to
say
she
had
unconsciously
pictured
denison
as
a
very
truculent
sort
of
individual
as
what
her
uncle
would
have
been
with
all
the
more
disagreeable
points
of
his
character
intensified
as
a
man
who
employed
spies
and
who
would
shrink
from
nothing
in
his
endeavours
to
do
his
kinsman
harm
yet
here
before
her
she
saw
a
very
old
gentleman
indeed
with
a
comical
yet
honest
and
kindly
face
and
dark
vivacious
eyes
that
seemed
brimming
over
with
amusement
at
her
evident
discomfiture
denison
took
her
hand
with
an
air
of
gallantry
and
touched
it
with
his
lips
enter
the
first
robber
he
said
with
one
of
his
whimsical
smiles
i
hope
my
ferocious
appearance
does
not
frighten
you
young
lady
you
will
get
used
to
me
better
my
dear
why
do
you
look
so
surprised
i
can
not
tell
you
how
pleased
i
am
to
meet
you
he
made
room
for
her
on
the
sofa
by
his
side
say
now
i
am
not
the
sort
of
looking
person
you
expected
to
find
ella
smiled
charmingly
somehow
she
had
taken
a
great
and
sudden
fancy
to
him
i
had
always
thought
of
you
as
being
so
different
she
said
as
an
ogre
no
doubt
he
rejoined
with
a
comical
nod
i
know
poor
gilbert
he
had
his
curious
fancies
and
one
of
them
was
to
abuse
me
i
as
sure
of
that
as
if
i
heard
him
my
dear
i
can
not
tell
you
how
pleased
i
am
to
meet
you
confess
now
that
you
had
expected
to
see
some
dangerous
kind
of
fellow
in
me
one
that
bites
eh
no
indeed
returned
ella
i
am
surprised
because
i
had
no
expectation
of
seeing
you
and
you
find
me
a
worse
hobgoblin
than
you
imagined
i
do
not
find
you
one
at
all
she
said
taking
the
place
beside
him
well
well
a
certain
personage
is
said
not
to
be
so
black
as
he
is
painted
let
us
hope
that
it
will
prove
so
in
the
present
case
ah
what
a
pity
it
is
that
frank
not
here
he
added
abruptly
your
son
mr
denison
asked
ella
her
serious
eyes
bent
full
upon
him
yes
my
son
my
my
the
plague
of
my
life
answered
denison
in
his
short
sharp
sentences
and
abrupt
turns
ella
was
put
strongly
in
mind
of
her
uncle
i
should
have
been
greatly
pleased
to
meet
him
she
said
is
he
away
from
home
away
from
home
exploded
the
old
gentleman
he
nearly
always
away
from
home
i
never
know
to
a
thousand
miles
where
to
lay
my
finger
on
him
he
might
be
a
gipsy
for
restlessness
he
is
always
gadding
about
from
dan
to
beersheba
an
incorrigible
young
fellow
a
rolling
stone
that
will
never
rest
anywhere
i
wish
to
goodness
he
would
get
married
to
some
woman
who
knew
how
to
tame
him
and
make
him
settle
down
at
home
ella
felt
amused
her
face
showed
it
denison
shook
his
head
and
frowned
now
why
could
frank
have
married
you
for
instance
he
suddenly
asked
after
a
brief
pause
this
amused
her
more
dear
denison
i
fear
it
would
be
altogether
beyond
my
powers
to
tame
so
inveterate
a
roamer
she
quietly
said
not
at
all
not
at
all
you
are
just
the
sort
of
woman
to
do
it
it
seemed
rather
doubtful
to
ella
whether
this
ought
to
be
taken
as
a
compliment
it
would
have
been
so
satisfactory
you
know
to
have
had
all
the
property
in
a
nutshell
yours
and
mine
added
the
old
gentleman
not
that
frank
need
covet
money
i
shall
be
able
to
leave
him
some
but
heron
dyke
ought
to
have
been
his
after
me
he
is
nearer
to
it
than
you
are
my
dear
you
have
too
much
good
sense
as
i
can
see
to
take
offence
at
an
old
man
crotchets
and
i
am
speaking
to
you
as
friend
speaks
to
friend
i
hope
you
will
always
so
speak
to
me
warmly
interrupted
ella
so
i
wish
frank
could
have
known
you
and
taken
a
fancy
to
you
my
dear
but
i
fear
it
is
too
late
in
the
day
to
hope
for
anything
so
desirable
frank
never
was
particularly
wise
and
i
have
a
sort
of
suspicion
that
what
he
would
call
his
affections
are
engaged
elsewhere
have
thought
it
for
some
little
time
then
i
sure
there
can
be
no
chance
for
me
cried
ella
merrily
well
well
anything
better
than
his
bringing
over
a
black
woman
for
a
wife
and
that
what
i
used
to
be
afraid
of
at
one
time
continued
denison
nodding
his
head
and
his
brown
wig
i
hope
frank
will
find
his
way
back
home
in
spring
he
resumed
after
a
pause
if
you
are
in
town
about
that
time
carlyon
and
i
must
contrive
to
bring
the
pair
of
you
together
there
may
be
a
chance
yet
i
do
suppose
the
young
dog
has
forgotten
how
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
the
ladies
and
he
is
considered
not
at
all
very
much
like
what
i
was
when
younger
this
tried
ella
gravity
a
little
as
i
think
i
said
before
i
shall
be
pleased
to
make
your
son
acquaintance
she
said
demurely
but
whether
frank
comes
home
or
not
my
dear
i
must
have
you
down
at
nunham
in
spring
you
will
find
many
things
there
that
you
have
never
seen
before
and
will
have
little
opportunity
of
seeing
elsewhere
you
are
intelligent
as
well
as
sensible
and
i
feel
sure
that
you
will
be
interested
next
to
picking
up
a
bargain
in
the
nothing
delighted
denison
more
than
to
secure
an
appreciative
listener
while
he
descanted
on
the
rarity
and
value
of
some
of
his
favourite
curiosities
and
this
he
found
in
ella
ella
on
her
part
was
very
glad
to
have
met
him
he
was
a
man
to
esteem
and
like
despite
his
eccentricities
and
she
felt
thankful
to
know
that
the
breach
in
the
family
which
had
existed
so
many
years
was
healed
at
last
her
face
flushed
as
she
recollected
that
if
the
fear
tormenting
her
latterly
had
grounds
heron
dyke
was
not
hers
but
denison
she
did
not
see
him
again
during
her
stay
in
london
for
he
went
away
to
nunham
priors
ella
was
by
no
means
certain
had
he
remained
that
she
should
not
have
imparted
to
him
all
her
doubts
and
fears
he
and
she
were
alike
honest
wishing
always
to
act
rightly
her
own
stay
in
london
only
extended
to
a
week
she
did
not
like
to
spare
more
time
from
home
at
present
the
week
passed
pleasantly
and
quickly
and
both
she
and
maria
kettle
returned
to
the
hall
in
better
health
and
spirits
than
they
were
in
when
they
quitted
it
gossip
in
remote
hamlets
and
small
country
towns
more
especially
if
the
subject
of
it
be
some
personage
grows
and
spreads
with
a
rapidity
unknown
to
the
rankest
tropical
weed
and
nullington
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
it
had
now
become
matter
of
common
talk
in
the
town
that
there
was
something
mysterious
and
unexplained
with
regard
to
squire
denison
death
how
or
whence
such
an
idea
originated
or
what
the
mysterious
something
might
be
people
did
not
care
to
ask
and
if
they
did
there
was
nobody
to
answer
facts
that
are
only
half
known
or
that
are
wildly
guessed
at
have
always
more
fascination
for
ordinary
minds
than
uncompromising
truths
that
stand
boldly
out
in
the
light
of
day
and
which
anyone
can
examine
for
themselves
the
nullingtonians
seized
on
the
rumour
with
avidity
and
one
may
be
sure
that
it
suffered
nothing
from
loss
or
diminution
in
its
transit
from
mouth
to
mouth
it
was
not
long
in
reaching
the
ears
of
nixon
the
agent
whom
plackett
had
formerly
employed
to
report
to
him
respecting
the
state
of
denison
health
and
the
general
progress
of
matters
at
the
hall
nixon
had
been
away
from
nullington
for
a
time
possibly
prosecuting
inquiries
elsewhere
and
these
rumours
greeted
him
on
his
return
putting
aside
any
pecuniary
benefit
he
might
gain
nixon
was
naturally
a
man
of
prying
and
inquisitive
disposition
nothing
pleased
him
better
than
worming
out
the
secrets
of
other
people
he
went
about
the
town
asking
guarded
questions
of
this
person
and
the
other
trying
to
put
the
various
fragments
of
gossip
together
and
trace
them
to
their
altogether
he
contrived
to
make
out
something
like
a
coherent
whole
upon
which
he
favoured
the
london
firm
plackett
plackett
and
rex
with
a
long
and
confidential
letter
the
letter
brought
down
charles
plackett
nixon
meeting
him
by
appointment
at
the
railway
station
the
two
had
some
private
conversation
together
what
we
can
not
understand
in
your
report
is
this
one
item
observed
charles
plackett
that
miss
winter
herself
suspects
some
fraud
has
been
at
work
and
is
as
anxious
to
have
matters
investigated
as
we
could
be
i
assure
you
sir
i
believe
it
to
be
so
affirmed
nixon
my
information
on
this
point
came
from
a
sure
source
well
i
intend
to
go
to
see
her
said
charles
plackett
nixon
opened
his
eyes
to
go
to
see
her
sir
what
at
heron
dyke
yes
why
not
it
is
the
only
step
i
can
take
and
whether
it
brings
forth
fruit
or
not
i
shall
at
any
rate
see
how
the
land
lies
with
regard
to
herself
if
she
is
as
you
think
anxious
for
the
investigation
she
is
a
good
and
honourable
young
lady
that
all
i
can
say
charles
plackett
took
a
fly
and
drove
over
to
heron
dyke
he
sent
in
his
card
to
miss
winter
and
was
at
once
admitted
ella
was
alone
maria
kettle
had
returned
to
the
vicarage
and
toynbee
was
not
yet
back
from
london
ella
knew
that
the
placketts
were
solicitors
and
she
supposed
this
gentleman
had
come
to
bring
her
some
message
from
him
that
idea
however
was
at
once
dispelled
i
am
come
here
this
morning
miss
winter
upon
rather
a
curious
errand
began
plackett
in
his
cheerful
chirruping
way
but
before
going
any
farther
it
may
be
as
well
to
say
that
i
am
come
without
the
knowledge
of
my
esteemed
client
denison
of
nunham
priors
in
fact
i
am
adopting
a
most
unusual
course
with
a
lawyer
i
am
venturing
to
intrude
upon
you
entirely
on
my
own
account
miss
winter
bowed
i
shall
be
pleased
to
hear
anything
that
you
may
have
to
communicate
she
said
frankly
plackett
paused
i
am
somewhat
in
what
way
to
begin
he
confessed
with
a
smile
a
difficulty
i
should
imagine
that
does
not
often
arise
with
gentlemen
of
your
profession
observed
ella
courteously
the
little
lawyer
laughed
i
believe
you
are
not
far
wrong
there
miss
winter
perhaps
my
best
plan
will
be
to
plunge
at
once
medias
i
may
say
then
that
some
disquieting
rumours
have
reached
our
ears
and
when
i
say
in
this
instance
i
mean
my
own
having
reference
to
certain
events
which
took
place
in
this
house
during
your
absence
abroad
the
events
i
allude
to
are
the
illness
and
death
of
the
late
denison
what
we
have
heard
would
almost
lead
us
to
imagine
that
deception
of
some
kind
if
not
fraud
itself
was
at
work
in
the
case
and
and
he
paused
ella
waited
frankly
speaking
miss
winter
i
have
heard
a
report
that
these
rumours
have
reached
yourself
and
i
am
here
to
ask
you
but
pray
do
not
answer
the
question
unless
you
feel
fully
at
liberty
to
do
so
whether
that
is
a
fact
yes
it
is
she
freely
answered
i
have
heard
the
rumours
ah
just
so
thank
you
very
much
for
your
frankness
i
presume
however
that
you
attach
very
little
importance
to
them
on
the
contrary
i
attach
very
considerable
importance
to
them
i
do
not
say
they
are
true
far
from
it
on
the
other
hand
i
do
not
know
but
they
may
be
the
doubt
renders
me
very
uneasy
really
now
i
sure
there
are
not
many
young
ladies
like
you
for
truth
and
candour
but
pardon
my
presumption
may
i
ask
whether
you
have
been
able
to
trace
the
rumours
to
any
foundation
perhaps
you
have
not
tried
to
do
so
i
have
tried
replied
ella
i
have
used
every
effort
to
track
them
back
to
their
source
though
it
is
not
much
of
course
that
it
lies
in
my
power
to
do
and
the
result
if
i
may
dare
to
ask
it
there
is
no
result
none
i
can
not
discover
whether
they
are
worthy
of
belief
or
whether
they
are
fabrications
that
certain
unnecessary
precautions
were
observed
during
my
late
uncle
illness
green
baize
doors
put
up
to
shield
him
from
the
household
friends
never
admitted
to
him
a
mysterious
kind
of
professional
nurse
had
down
from
london
to
attend
him
is
true
but
those
about
him
jago
and
old
aaron
stone
explain
all
this
away
with
perfect
plausibility
charles
plackett
mused
no
of
course
not
there
was
not
much
you
could
do
he
remarked
apparently
speaking
to
himself
an
individual
whom
i
will
not
name
warned
me
that
heron
dyke
was
not
legally
mine
resumed
miss
winter
i
was
startled
as
you
may
suppose
but
i
could
elicit
nothing
further
nothing
but
what
i
tell
you
that
i
held
heron
dyke
by
fraud
dear
me
i
did
not
know
whether
to
believe
it
or
not
i
do
not
know
now
i
carried
the
tale
to
daventry
and
i
spoke
also
to
my
uncle
old
friend
the
vicar
of
nullington
neither
of
them
attached
the
smallest
credibility
to
the
charge
they
almost
ridiculed
it
daventry
says
that
nothing
whatever
could
deprive
me
of
heron
dyke
save
my
not
having
lived
to
see
his
seventieth
birthday
and
several
persons
saw
him
and
conversed
with
him
subsequently
to
that
date
i
did
for
one
remarked
charles
plackett
well
i
do
see
that
there
much
to
be
done
you
say
you
will
not
give
up
the
name
of
the
individual
who
no
she
interrupted
and
if
i
did
give
it
the
end
would
not
be
answered
he
he
is
no
longer
here
he
could
not
be
questioned
it
is
one
of
the
most
puzzling
questions
i
ever
had
to
do
with
madam
heron
dyke
is
a
fine
property
you
would
not
like
to
give
it
up
i
would
give
it
up
if
i
were
sure
it
were
denison
i
wish
i
was
sure
one
way
or
the
other
if
it
is
not
mine
it
must
be
his
and
he
would
have
every
right
to
it
does
he
know
of
this
doubt
not
a
word
i
met
him
a
short
while
ago
when
i
was
in
london
he
came
to
my
aunt
carlyon
i
took
a
great
fancy
to
him
charles
plackett
smiled
and
he
took
a
fancy
to
a
certain
young
lady
if
i
may
say
as
much
he
called
at
our
office
the
next
day
before
returning
to
nunham
priors
what
do
you
think
he
said
miss
winter
that
he
did
not
so
much
regret
the
loss
of
heron
dyke
now
when
he
saw
what
charming
hands
held
it
ella
rather
shrank
from
the
compliment
i
and
my
interests
are
as
nothing
plackett
in
comparison
with
arriving
at
the
truth
if
fraud
and
deception
have
been
at
work
it
is
to
the
advantage
of
everyone
that
they
should
be
exposed
and
frustrated
plackett
gazed
on
her
glowing
face
admiringly
if
everyone
thought
and
acted
like
you
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
i
am
afraid
that
the
occupation
of
us
poor
lawyers
would
soon
become
a
thing
of
the
past
that
would
be
a
catastrophe
indeed
responded
ella
with
a
laugh
a
little
more
conversation
ensued
one
word
leading
to
another
ella
confided
to
him
what
the
servant
eliza
had
told
her
that
she
had
penetrated
beyond
the
green
baize
doors
on
one
lucky
occasion
when
they
were
left
unguarded
and
had
found
the
squire
rooms
empty
denison
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
in
them
nay
more
the
rooms
and
the
bed
appeared
to
be
unoccupied
plackett
though
evidently
much
surprised
could
still
make
nothing
of
it
he
sat
fingering
his
grey
hair
a
habit
of
his
when
in
thought
ella
finished
by
inquiring
what
more
she
could
do
i
really
fail
to
see
at
present
that
there
is
anything
more
you
can
do
he
answered
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
not
one
person
in
a
thousand
would
do
as
much
as
you
have
already
done
are
you
sure
it
was
my
uncle
you
saw
she
inquired
speaking
on
the
moment
impulse
when
you
were
here
two
days
after
his
birthday
charles
plackett
paused
revolving
the
question
i
thought
i
was
sure
he
said
although
i
had
only
seen
denison
twice
before
and
that
some
years
previously
he
certainly
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
same
individual
naturally
much
wasted
and
changed
by
illness
one
thing
i
perfectly
remembered
the
beautiful
ring
he
wore
yes
i
think
it
could
have
been
no
other
than
denison
and
no
other
temper
than
his
you
heard
probably
of
the
passion
he
went
into
and
threw
away
his
and
broke
the
cup
truly
i
can
not
imagine
anyone
doing
that
save
my
uncle
i
must
say
that
i
have
not
been
so
thoroughly
puzzled
by
any
case
for
a
long
while
remarked
the
lawyer
as
he
rose
to
depart
and
puzzled
plackett
was
destined
to
remain
at
least
for
some
time
yet
to
come
if
miss
winter
had
looked
to
benefit
by
his
advice
she
was
disappointed
he
had
no
advice
of
any
consequence
to
offer
he
could
only
thank
her
again
for
her
frankness
and
say
that
he
would
consult
with
his
client
denison
and
with
her
permission
write
to
her
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
then
declining
refreshments
he
left
the
hall
much
more
disquieted
in
his
mind
than
when
he
had
arrived
at
it
but
within
an
hour
of
the
lawyer
departure
miss
winter
had
something
else
to
think
about
than
his
promise
to
write
to
her
there
came
a
telegram
from
edward
conroy
he
had
reached
london
and
hoped
to
be
at
heron
dyke
on
the
morrow
chapter
a
fruitless
errand
matters
with
philip
cleeve
were
not
progressing
quite
to
his
satisfaction
upon
going
down
to
breakfast
one
morning
he
was
surprised
to
find
his
mother
down
before
him
a
notable
thing
for
lady
cleeve
was
seldom
able
to
rise
early
philip
kissed
her
fondly
this
is
a
rare
treat
mother
he
said
it
seems
like
old
times
come
back
again
she
pressed
his
hand
and
smiled
tenderly
in
his
bright
handsome
face
i
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
before
you
go
out
philip
i
sat
up
for
you
last
night
but
you
came
home
late
ah
yes
to
be
sure
replied
philip
hurriedly
very
conscious
that
he
was
too
often
late
i
went
round
to
george
winstone
lodgings
and
the
time
slipped
away
so
long
as
you
were
enjoying
yourself
dear
it
was
quite
right
answered
lady
cleeve
in
her
eyes
philip
could
do
no
wrong
and
what
is
it
mother
that
you
have
to
say
to
me
he
asked
carelessly
taking
up
a
piece
of
toast
and
playing
with
the
he
was
growing
vaguely
uneasy
already
i
met
tiplady
yesterday
began
lady
cleeve
and
philip
put
down
the
knife
without
using
it
his
heart
sank
within
him
i
had
to
call
in
at
wharton
about
my
broken
spectacles
and
there
i
found
tiplady
having
a
new
key
fitted
to
his
watch
we
came
away
together
and
i
took
the
opportunity
of
reminding
him
of
his
promise
given
so
long
ago
to
take
you
into
partnership
he
had
by
no
means
forgotten
it
he
said
and
was
willing
that
the
question
should
be
brought
to
a
practical
issue
as
soon
as
i
pleased
of
course
you
will
not
take
a
full
share
at
present
he
intimated
that
only
a
small
one
but
it
will
be
a
very
great
thing
for
you
philip
and
you
can
afford
to
wait
philip
made
no
comment
upon
this
lady
cleeve
continued
i
thanked
him
for
his
generosity
it
generous
of
him
she
added
to
admit
you
with
only
a
poor
thousand
pounds
he
does
not
want
money
interrupted
philip
resentfully
tiplady
is
as
rich
as
can
be
and
he
has
nobody
to
come
after
him
he
is
none
the
less
generous
many
men
in
his
position
would
not
take
in
a
partner
under
several
thousands
of
pounds
returned
lady
cleeve
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
was
this
dear
that
he
will
probably
speak
to
you
there
need
not
be
any
further
delay
daventry
will
draw
up
the
deed
of
partnership
and
nothing
will
then
remain
but
for
you
to
pay
over
the
money
philip
rose
abruptly
and
pushed
back
his
chair
then
he
turned
and
gazed
through
the
window
to
hide
his
emotion
you
have
not
done
breakfast
dear
cried
lady
cleeve
in
dismay
you
have
eaten
scarcely
anything
i
have
done
very
well
indeed
thank
you
mother
he
answered
from
the
window
i
have
one
of
my
headaches
this
morning
poor
boy
the
news
is
a
delightful
surprise
to
him
thought
lady
cleeve
philip
is
just
as
sensitive
as
he
used
to
be
philip
got
away
from
his
mother
and
the
house
as
quickly
as
possible
walking
along
the
road
like
a
man
in
a
dream
the
thousand
pounds
or
the
greater
portion
of
what
was
left
of
it
had
gone
out
of
his
hands
to
captain
lennox
or
rather
to
that
blessed
company
that
the
captain
was
just
now
so
eager
over
early
though
it
was
philip
must
see
him
and
he
bent
his
steps
towards
the
lilacs
as
he
went
along
the
thought
struck
him
that
he
had
not
seen
lennox
about
very
lately
the
last
time
philip
called
he
was
told
by
the
that
the
captain
had
gone
out
for
the
day
and
ducie
was
ill
with
a
cold
it
was
a
who
answered
philip
nervous
ring
at
the
house
this
morning
her
master
was
in
london
she
said
in
london
exclaimed
philip
when
did
he
go
rather
more
than
a
week
ago
i
think
sir
was
the
girl
answer
i
want
to
see
captain
lennox
particularly
rejoined
philip
i
dare
say
he
will
be
back
soon
now
sir
i
not
heard
that
he
means
to
make
a
long
stay
this
time
philip
pondered
can
i
see
ducie
ask
her
to
pardon
the
early
hour
and
see
me
for
a
minute
if
she
will
be
so
kind
ducie
ca
see
you
now
sir
dissented
the
maid
she
is
not
yet
up
her
cold
keeps
very
bad
and
she
hardly
comes
down
at
all
can
you
take
a
message
to
her
oh
yes
sir
i
can
do
that
her
breakfast
is
just
gone
up
give
my
kind
regards
to
ducie
and
ask
her
if
she
will
tell
me
when
the
captain
will
be
at
home
the
maid
ran
upstairs
and
soon
came
down
with
the
return
message
ducie
very
kind
regards
to
cleeve
and
she
had
not
the
least
notion
when
not
for
a
few
days
she
thought
as
his
last
letter
received
yesterday
said
nothing
about
it
philip
turned
away
from
the
lilacs
as
wise
as
he
had
gone
hardly
heeding
which
way
he
took
save
that
it
was
from
the
office
instead
of
to
it
knowing
what
he
knew
he
asked
himself
how
it
was
possible
for
him
to
face
tiplady
inquiries
out
of
the
twelve
hundred
pounds
given
him
by
his
mother
so
short
a
time
ago
to
be
held
by
him
as
a
sacred
trust
only
a
balance
of
pounds
remained
in
the
bank
it
is
true
that
if
captain
lennox
prognostications
respecting
the
splendid
future
of
the
hermandad
silver
mining
company
should
prove
to
be
correct
philip
cleeve
would
more
than
recoup
himself
in
the
whole
sum
which
he
was
now
deficient
when
lennox
first
bought
the
shares
for
him
he
had
assured
philip
that
no
further
calls
would
be
made
but
despite
this
assurance
two
heavy
calls
had
since
had
to
be
met
for
expenses
calls
which
had
gone
far
towards
exhausting
remaining
resources
captain
lennox
had
made
no
secret
of
his
own
disappointment
and
annoyance
but
he
was
as
sanguine
as
ever
of
ultimate
success
and
he
had
put
it
so
strongly
to
philip
whether
it
would
not
be
wiser
to
double
his
venture
rather
than
forfeit
the
sum
already
invested
that
the
latter
had
agreed
to
meet
the
calls
although
not
without
a
sadly
misgiving
heart
as
matters
however
had
now
turned
out
he
must
find
lennox
at
once
and
show
him
the
necessity
for
the
shares
being
disposed
of
without
delay
in
that
philip
anticipated
no
difficulty
as
the
shares
were
so
much
sought
after
or
else
he
must
get
captain
lennox
to
go
with
him
to
lady
cleeve
and
tiplady
and
explain
to
them
how
well
the
money
was
invested
and
persuade
them
that
in
view
of
the
splendid
profits
sure
to
accrue
before
long
it
would
be
folly
to
sell
out
just
now
evidently
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
find
captain
lennox
a
little
comforted
in
mind
by
the
fact
of
having
arrived
at
some
sort
of
a
decision
he
made
his
way
with
hesitating
steps
to
the
office
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
find
that
tiplady
had
started
by
an
early
train
for
norwich
and
would
not
be
back
till
night
this
gave
philip
for
which
he
was
thankful
getting
his
dinner
away
he
spent
the
evening
with
some
friends
and
was
careful
not
to
reach
home
until
sure
his
mother
would
be
in
bed
that
night
on
his
sleepless
pillow
he
decided
on
his
plans
early
in
the
morning
before
lady
cleeve
could
be
downstairs
philip
snatched
a
hasty
breakfast
and
went
out
he
left
a
note
for
his
mother
in
which
he
told
her
that
he
had
to
go
suddenly
to
london
on
business
and
she
was
not
to
be
surprised
or
alarmed
if
he
did
not
return
till
the
evening
of
the
following
day
then
he
despatched
a
nearly
identical
note
to
tiplady
which
philip
thought
a
clever
hit
lady
cleeve
would
take
it
that
he
was
away
on
business
connected
with
the
office
while
tiplady
would
be
sure
to
imagine
that
it
was
on
some
affairs
of
his
mother
he
was
despatched
to
london
making
his
way
to
the
philip
caught
a
passing
train
and
was
whirled
away
to
the
metropolis
when
in
london
captain
lennox
generally
stayed
at
his
favourite
hotel
the
piazza
in
covent
garden
this
philip
knew
and
he
drove
there
direct
from
the
station
the
urbane
individual
who
was
fetched
to
answer
his
inquiries
and
who
had
more
the
look
of
a
church
dignitary
than
of
a
head
waiter
told
philip
that
although
captain
lennox
was
as
he
surmised
frequently
at
the
hotel
he
had
not
been
there
lately
for
the
past
six
weeks
or
so
they
had
not
seen
him
neither
were
they
in
a
position
to
afford
any
information
as
to
his
whereabouts
all
that
philip
could
do
was
to
dissemble
his
disappointment
and
go
this
seemed
to
philip
a
worse
check
than
the
one
at
the
lilacs
the
previous
morning
halting
in
the
street
he
bethought
himself
what
he
could
do
where
look
for
lennox
only
one
place
presented
itself
to
his
mind
and
that
was
the
office
of
the
hermandad
company
it
was
situate
in
the
city
new
broad
street
if
he
did
not
see
the
captain
there
he
should
at
least
hear
where
he
was
to
be
found
but
philip
thought
he
most
likely
should
see
him
half
an
hour
drive
in
a
hansom
cab
took
him
to
broad
street
and
to
the
proper
number
at
which
the
cabman
readily
drew
up
but
philip
could
not
so
easily
find
the
office
he
was
in
search
of
on
a
large
board
outside
the
doorway
were
painted
up
the
names
of
some
thirty
or
forty
different
firms
or
companies
each
of
them
occupying
offices
in
the
same
building
philip
at
length
discovered
the
name
he
wanted
the
last
but
two
on
the
list
and
was
directed
to
mount
to
the
third
floor
on
the
third
floor
and
a
very
dingy
floor
it
was
for
the
building
was
an
old
one
he
found
the
hermandad
office
philip
imagination
had
led
him
to
fancy
the
offices
of
so
important
a
company
as
rather
grand
and
imposing
this
did
not
look
like
it
the
door
was
shut
and
he
could
not
open
it
he
knocked
again
and
again
but
without
response
while
wondering
at
all
this
and
standing
to
think
what
he
could
do
next
an
opposite
door
was
opened
and
a
youth
came
out
nobody
at
home
here
apparently
remarked
philip
pointing
to
the
door
what
the
best
time
to
find
them
in
do
know
answered
the
youth
twisting
his
mouth
into
a
grin
nobody
been
here
for
a
fortnight
but
a
boy
to
fetch
letters
nobody
been
here
for
a
fortnight
exclaimed
philip
nobody
else
not
likely
company
hey
oh
jemima
philip
could
have
wrung
the
boy
neck
are
you
one
of
the
green
continued
he
lots
of
come
no
use
though
not
a
bit
only
have
to
go
away
again
fishy
awful
next
akin
to
smashing
up
with
these
strange
remarks
the
boy
shot
off
sliding
down
the
banisters
leaving
philip
feeling
sick
at
heart
the
hermandad
mine
had
evidently
failed
and
its
company
come
to
grief
a
suspicion
stole
over
philip
that
captain
lennox
might
be
more
hardly
hit
than
the
world
suspected
and
was
keeping
out
of
the
way
what
to
do
he
knew
not
was
there
anything
that
he
could
do
next
except
go
back
home
and
reveal
everything
to
his
mother
he
had
tasted
nothing
all
day
save
his
morsel
of
breakfast
and
although
he
had
no
appetite
he
felt
so
faint
that
he
knew
he
must
take
refreshment
of
some
kind
if
he
did
not
wish
his
strength
to
break
down
turning
into
the
nearest
restaurant
he
called
for
a
glass
of
wine
and
tried
to
study
the
carte
but
the
names
of
the
different
dishes
conveyed
no
definite
ideas
to
his
mind
bring
me
anything
you
have
ready
he
said
wearily
to
the
waiter
a
basin
of
soup
will
do
and
then
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
shut
his
eyes
the
waiter
had
just
put
some
soup
before
him
and
was
about
to
take
off
the
cover
when
philip
started
to
his
feet
with
an
exclamation
by
heavens
i
never
thought
of
that
staring
around
he
sat
down
in
a
little
confusion
for
the
moment
he
had
forgotten
where
he
was
the
waiter
looked
askance
at
him
to
discover
whether
he
was
mad
but
the
fact
was
that
philip
had
had
what
seemed
to
him
nothing
less
than
a
flash
of
inspiration
he
had
suddenly
remembered
that
there
was
such
a
person
as
freddy
bootle
in
existence
why
not
go
to
him
in
his
trouble
freddy
was
rich
and
as
kindhearted
as
he
was
rich
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
allow
a
friend
to
sink
for
want
of
a
helping
hand
in
any
case
philip
felt
sure
of
his
sympathy
and
advice
eating
his
soup
with
some
degree
of
relish
he
paid
and
drove
off
in
a
hansom
to
bootle
rooms
in
bond
street
philip
felt
desperate
especially
at
the
thought
of
having
to
reveal
his
folly
to
his
mother
and
her
consequent
distress
that
seemed
worse
than
the
loss
of
the
money
itself
never
had
his
conduct
his
almost
criminal
weakness
presented
itself
to
him
in
so
odious
a
light
as
now
had
the
money
been
absolutely
his
own
had
it
been
bequeathed
to
him
by
will
or
come
to
him
by
any
mode
other
than
that
by
which
it
had
come
he
could
have
borne
to
lose
it
with
comparative
equanimity
but
when
he
called
to
mind
the
fact
that
the
sum
which
it
had
taken
him
so
short
a
time
to
dissipate
was
the
accumulation
of
long
years
of
patient
pinching
and
hoarding
on
the
part
of
his
mother
that
it
represented
many
a
luxury
many
a
harmless
pleasure
ruthlessly
sacrificed
and
that
all
this
had
been
done
to
ensure
the
advancement
in
life
of
his
worthless
self
he
was
almost
ready
to
think
that
the
sooner
the
world
were
rid
of
him
the
better
for
everyone
concerned
how
could
he
ever
bear
to
face
again
that
mother
and
her
thoughtful
love
how
witness
her
pained
face
when
he
should
declare
his
folly
she
be
told
if
only
freddy
bootle
would
give
him
a
help
in
this
strait
what
a
different
man
he
would
be
in
time
to
come
it
was
a
break
in
the
bitterness
of
his
thoughts
when
the
cab
drew
up
at
bootle
lodgings
philip
was
not
kept
long
in
suspense
an
elderly
man
answered
his
knock
and
ring
the
elderly
man
was
sorry
to
say
that
bootle
was
in
rome
at
present
and
was
not
expected
back
till
after
christmas
was
there
ever
so
unlucky
a
wretch
as
i
murmured
philip
to
himself
as
he
turned
more
sick
at
heart
than
ever
from
the
door
his
one
and
only
hope
had
failed
him
the
short
winter
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
the
lamps
were
being
lighted
as
he
turned
into
piccadilly
he
wandered
about
aimlessly
for
some
time
into
this
street
and
that
stopping
now
and
again
to
stare
into
a
or
at
the
unending
procession
of
vehicles
in
the
busier
streets
and
then
wandering
on
again
without
seeming
to
see
anything
all
at
once
he
was
startled
into
the
most
vivid
life
coming
towards
him
but
yet
a
little
distance
away
and
with
several
of
the
hurrying
crowd
between
them
he
saw
captain
lennox
the
light
from
a
shone
full
on
his
pale
features
and
there
could
be
no
mistake
philip
sprang
forward
eagerly
and
the
sudden
movement
seemed
to
have
the
effect
of
attracting
the
glance
towards
him
for
one
brief
moment
there
came
or
philip
thought
there
did
a
gleam
of
recognition
into
those
eyes
the
next
they
and
their
owner
were
alike
hidden
by
the
intervening
crowd
philip
cleeve
shouldered
his
way
along
more
roughly
than
he
had
ever
done
before
in
a
few
seconds
he
was
standing
on
the
exact
spot
where
he
had
seen
lennox
but
that
individual
was
no
longer
visible
he
had
vanished
as
completely
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
him
up
philip
stared
about
him
like
a
man
suddenly
moonstruck
unheedful
of
the
jostling
and
elbowing
of
the
passersby
up
the
street
and
down
the
street
he
gazed
but
no
captain
lennox
was
to
be
seen
what
have
become
of
him
surely
he
need
not
hide
himself
from
me
thought
philip
we
are
both
in
the
same
boat
looking
about
for
the
captain
in
a
sort
of
amazed
doubt
philip
saw
that
he
stood
close
before
the
open
door
of
a
large
drapery
emporium
was
it
possible
that
lennox
had
taken
refuge
inside
no
sooner
did
the
thought
flash
across
philip
mind
than
he
marched
boldly
into
the
shop
there
were
several
people
there
customers
and
assistants
but
no
signs
of
the
man
he
was
seeking
a
civil
assistant
came
up
to
ask
what
they
could
serve
him
with
and
philip
frankly
avowed
the
cause
of
his
entering
a
friend
a
gentleman
had
suddenly
disappeared
before
he
could
reach
him
he
could
only
think
he
had
entered
the
shop
very
possibly
the
young
man
replied
and
as
he
was
not
to
be
seen
in
it
now
he
might
have
passed
through
it
and
left
by
the
opposite
door
then
philip
saw
that
the
shop
was
what
might
be
called
a
double
one
that
is
to
stay
that
it
had
a
door
and
window
opening
into
another
street
had
lennox
walked
in
at
one
door
and
out
at
the
other
without
stopping
to
purchase
anything
it
was
the
conclusion
philip
came
to
he
recognised
the
uselessness
of
further
pursuit
of
lennox
it
was
clear
that
the
captain
had
purposely
evaded
meeting
him
the
reason
for
such
evasion
was
not
far
to
seek
philip
purchased
a
pair
of
gloves
and
then
pursued
his
aimless
way
weary
and
downcast
where
should
he
go
and
what
should
he
do
he
knew
not
and
he
did
not
greatly
care
he
was
there
alone
in
the
huge
wilderness
of
london
without
one
living
creature
that
knew
him
or
that
cared
for
him
it
was
not
too
late
to
take
the
last
train
home
but
he
had
a
fixed
repugnance
against
doing
so
why
hasten
to
meet
his
reproachful
eyes
and
tiplady
incisive
questionings
and
yet
if
he
stayed
the
night
in
london
he
must
face
those
ordeals
on
the
morrow
what
could
the
morrow
bring
him
more
than
had
brought
still
he
wandered
aimlessly
on
through
one
mile
of
street
after
another
his
thoughts
brimming
over
with
bitterness
at
the
recollection
of
all
his
mad
folly
what
now
to
him
but
mad
folly
seemed
those
nights
at
the
lilacs
when
flushed
with
wine
he
had
staked
his
mother
savings
on
the
turn
of
a
card
and
had
seen
the
gold
hoarded
by
her
for
his
sake
swept
almost
contemptuously
into
the
pockets
of
such
men
as
camberley
and
lennox
who
the
moment
his
back
was
turned
probably
sneered
at
him
as
a
jay
parading
in
peacock
plumes
what
now
to
him
but
folly
seemed
the
spells
which
he
had
allowed
to
be
woven
round
him
by
the
witcheries
of
margaret
ducie
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
had
never
really
cared
for
her
however
much
at
the
time
he
might
fancy
that
he
had
not
even
when
her
hold
over
him
had
seemed
the
strongest
and
now
when
he
looked
back
she
assumed
in
his
thoughts
the
semblance
of
one
of
those
specious
phantoms
lovely
to
look
upon
but
who
seem
sent
only
to
lure
fools
to
destruction
poor
philip
from
the
burning
thoughts
within
him
rose
next
another
phantom
nothing
specious
about
but
pure
and
as
a
lily
steeped
in
dew
the
image
of
maria
kettle
had
he
indeed
lost
her
he
knew
now
how
much
she
was
to
him
that
he
had
never
loved
but
her
yes
she
was
surely
lost
to
him
for
ever
he
would
have
no
home
to
take
her
to
and
no
prospect
of
winning
a
position
for
himself
a
life
of
commonplace
drudgery
of
separation
from
the
only
woman
he
had
ever
loved
or
could
love
was
all
that
now
lay
before
him
still
onward
ever
onward
went
he
in
his
pain
oh
my
darling
you
might
have
saved
me
if
you
would
he
cried
you
might
you
might
still
onward
ever
onward
from
tower
and
steeple
the
hours
were
clanged
out
one
after
another
but
he
heeded
them
not
it
was
close
upon
midnight
when
he
found
himself
standing
on
one
of
the
great
bridges
that
span
the
thames
far
away
into
the
blackness
on
either
side
of
him
the
great
city
spread
itself
out
seeming
to
his
imagination
at
that
hour
like
some
huge
monster
that
was
slowly
settling
itself
down
to
sleep
silently
below
him
ran
the
sullen
river
stealthily
carrying
its
dread
secrets
down
to
the
sea
here
and
there
a
few
feeble
lamps
mocked
the
darkness
philip
cleeve
stood
and
gazed
over
the
parapet
into
the
stream
below
how
many
unhappy
men
might
not
have
flung
off
bitter
burden
at
that
very
spot
how
easy
the
process
a
leap
a
plunge
a
minute
brief
struggle
and
then
the
deep
deep
sleep
that
knows
no
waking
could
it
be
really
wrong
to
throw
away
that
which
was
no
longer
of
any
value
that
which
had
become
a
burden
and
for
which
he
no
longer
cared
the
question
kept
coming
back
to
him
with
a
sort
of
dreadful
fascination
he
could
hear
the
faint
lapping
of
the
tide
against
the
piers
and
the
longer
he
gazed
down
at
the
water
the
more
it
seemed
to
whisper
to
him
of
peace
and
rest
and
a
quiet
ending
to
all
his
troubles
why
not
quit
a
world
in
which
there
no
longer
seemed
a
place
for
him
why
not
suddenly
there
arose
a
sound
behind
him
as
of
the
quick
patter
of
feet
before
philip
had
time
to
interfere
before
he
well
knew
what
had
happened
a
female
figure
scantily
clad
and
with
hair
flying
to
the
winds
had
sprung
on
one
of
the
stone
seats
and
thence
on
to
the
parapet
for
one
brief
instant
she
stood
thus
dimly
outlined
against
the
starlit
sky
then
with
hands
clasped
above
her
head
and
a
low
wild
cry
she
sprang
headlong
to
her
death
a
little
crowd
gathered
as
if
by
magic
where
there
had
seemed
to
be
scarcely
anyone
a
minute
before
faint
at
heart
dizzy
with
the
sudden
horror
of
the
thing
philip
cleeve
fell
back
from
the
rest
what
were
his
little
troubles
compared
with
those
which
must
have
driven
that
poor
desperate
creature
to
destruction
the
black
sullen
river
had
suddenly
become
hateful
to
him
and
he
made
haste
to
leave
it
far
behind

into

the

hall
now
was
not
slow
to
perceive
the
state
of
affairs
she
wrote
to
her
friend
and
patroness
lady
dimsdale
that
she
was
afraid
she
should
have
to
look
out
for
another
home
before
long
for
unless
she
was
much
mistaken
miss
winter
was
about
to
marry
the
gentleman
she
was
good
enough
to
say
was
a
very
pleasant
person
named
conroy
but
it
seemed
to
her
a
great
pity
that
miss
winter
had
not
chosen
someone
more
nearly
her
equal
in
the
social
scale
the
weather
was
mild
and
open
for
the
time
of
year
and
conroy
and
ella
were
much
out
of
doors
during
these
rambles
the
conversation
often
turned
upon
past
affairs
and
many
a
consultation
took
place
as
to
what
could
be
done
to
bring
to
light
all
that
still
remained
doubtful
and
obscure
there
was
so
much
of
it
taken
as
a
whole
so
many
points
that
presented
their
own
difficulties
the
doubt
as
to
whether
ella
was
the
legal
inheritor
of
heron
dyke
the
disappearance
of
katherine
keen
and
the
superstition
that
arose
out
of
it
the
murder
of
the
hubert
stone
and
the
robbery
of
the
jewels
all
these
were
matters
of
grave
perplexity
upon
which
no
light
had
yet
been
thrown
edward
conroy
was
puzzled
by
it
all
just
as
charles
plackett
had
been
he
seemed
never
to
tire
of
questioning
ella
on
this
point
and
on
that
and
made
notes
sometimes
of
her
answers
but
he
was
none
the
nearer
seeing
his
way
to
any
elucidation
have
you
fully
calculated
what
the
result
to
yourself
will
be
if
it
is
discovered
that
fraud
has
been
at
work
he
said
to
her
one
day
when
they
had
been
speaking
of
what
had
happened
at
heron
dyke
during
her
absence
fully
replied
ella
home
money
and
lands
all
will
go
from
you
i
know
it
but
would
you
have
had
me
act
otherwise
than
as
i
have
acted
would
you
have
had
me
keep
the
doubt
to
myself
not
for
worlds
i
think
i
think
edward
you
are
as
anxious
to
discover
the
truth
as
i
am
quite
as
anxious
although
it
be
against
your
own
interest
after
all
it
may
be
that
you
will
have
a
penniless
wife
compared
with
the
rich
one
you
expected
so
much
the
better
she
will
owe
all
the
more
to
me
and
the
world
can
not
then
say
that
i
have
married
her
for
her
fortune
as
if
you
cared
for
anything
the
world
might
choose
to
say
and
to
this
remark
conroy
slightly
laughed
in
answer
he
had
not
been
more
than
a
day
or
two
at
heron
dyke
when
miss
winter
put
into
his
hands
the
malachite
and
gold
which
betsy
tucker
had
sent
her
by
mrs
keen
betsy
was
recovering
slowly
from
her
illness
all
danger
was
over
i
should
like
to
see
the
young
woman
and
question
her
observed
he
turning
the
link
about
in
his
hand
as
he
examined
it
critically
there
will
be
no
difficulty
said
ella
betsy
has
been
out
for
one
airing
and
she
can
come
here
why
do
you
look
at
the
trinket
so
attentively
have
you
ever
seen
it
before
never
but
it
is
one
of
rather
remarkable
workmanship
a
fly
brought
betsy
tucker
to
the
hall
there
in
the
presence
of
conroy
she
was
requested
to
point
out
the
place
as
nearly
as
she
could
recollect
it
where
she
had
picked
up
the
link
it
was
within
a
few
yards
of
the
spot
where
hubert
stone
was
found
the
girl
had
nothing
more
to
tell
and
sobbed
out
her
contrition
for
her
fault
miss
winter
was
everything
that
was
kind
but
conroy
speaking
sternly
warned
her
not
to
disclose
a
word
to
anyone
about
the
affair
or
there
was
no
telling
what
the
consequences
to
herself
might
be
the
girl
with
many
tears
promised
faithfully
to
keep
the
secret
and
seemed
only
too
glad
to
be
let
off
so
easily
the
had
not
belonged
so
far
as
could
be
ascertained
to
hubert
whether
it
had
or
had
not
been
the
property
of
his
assailant
was
another
matter
if
so
it
must
have
been
wrenched
from
his
sleeve
during
the
scuffle
and
as
edward
conroy
shrewdly
remarked
it
proved
that
the
assailant
was
a
gentleman
no
man
in
an
inferior
station
would
be
likely
to
wear
such
a
link
i
shall
run
up
to
town
said
edward
conroy
to
ella
when
the
interview
was
over
and
they
were
alone
to
town
for
anything
in
particular
merely
to
put
this
malachite
and
gold
trinket
into
certain
hands
he
added
if
this
link
can
be
traced
out
to
its
owner
it
may
lead
to
some
discoveries
conroy
accordingly
went
to
london
this
it
will
be
noted
was
within
two
or
three
days
of
his
first
arrival
at
heron
dyke
he
returned
from
london
the
following
day
having
put
matters
together
with
the
as
he
informed
miss
winter
into
efficient
hands
taking
up
his
abode
as
before
at
nullington
he
passed
a
considerable
portion
of
his
time
at
heron
dyke
months
before
this
conroy
had
heard
tell
of
the
strange
disappearance
of
katherine
keen
but
only
now
was
he
made
aware
that
the
hall
was
supposed
to
be
haunted
by
her
presence
he
listened
to
the
story
of
how
the
two
maids
whom
aaron
stone
had
afterwards
discharged
in
consequence
had
positively
asserted
that
they
saw
her
looking
down
upon
them
from
the
gallery
he
heard
the
story
of
fright
and
of
maria
kettle
strange
experience
not
long
ago
the
evidence
taken
collectively
was
too
strong
to
be
altogether
ignored
despite
his
inclination
so
to
treat
it
i
wish
the
ghost
would
favour
me
with
a
visit
he
heartily
exclaimed
i
would
do
my
best
to
put
its
unsubstantiality
to
the
proof
i
know
not
which
would
be
the
worse
to
find
that
katherine
is
in
the
hall
in
the
flesh
that
she
is
not
dead
as
her
poor
sister
believes
or
that
the
house
is
haunted
by
her
spirit
breathed
miss
winter
in
answer
have
you
any
objection
to
my
exploring
this
north
wing
he
inquired
after
a
pause
of
thought
not
the
least
i
should
be
thankful
for
you
to
do
so
conroy
lost
no
time
that
same
afternoon
he
ascended
to
the
north
wing
and
did
not
come
down
until
he
had
visited
every
nook
and
corner
of
it
room
after
room
passage
after
passage
closet
after
closet
he
examined
and
satisfied
himself
that
no
person
or
thing
was
hidden
in
them
taking
the
precaution
to
lock
the
doors
he
brought
the
keys
away
with
him
troubled
spirits
never
walk
by
daylight
i
believe
remarked
toynbee
to
him
she
had
never
relished
the
superstitious
tales
we
must
look
for
them
by
dark
conroy
if
at
all
that
is
just
what
i
mean
to
do
replied
conroy
and
accordingly
he
took
to
rambling
about
the
north
wing
in
the
dusk
of
evening
in
the
hope
that
one
time
or
another
he
should
encounter
the
supposed
ghost
he
would
sit
for
half
an
hour
at
a
time
silent
and
immovable
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
gallery
with
no
company
but
the
mice
busy
at
work
behind
the
wainscot
i
may
have
to
wait
for
weeks
he
said
to
ella
but
if
there
be
any
ghost
at
all
i
shall
be
sure
to
see
it
one
evening
when
dusk
was
creeping
on
a
certain
meath
arrived
at
the
hall
a
telegram
to
conroy
having
given
previous
notice
that
he
might
be
expected
and
he
was
at
once
admitted
the
stranger
was
the
chief
of
a
in
london
it
was
to
him
that
conroy
had
confided
the
he
was
a
tall
lanky
man
of
sixty
with
dyed
hair
and
a
slow
deferential
smile
he
always
dressed
in
black
as
being
the
most
becoming
wear
for
a
gentleman
and
that
he
invariably
looked
the
latter
meath
was
fully
persuaded
whereas
he
had
in
fact
more
of
the
air
of
a
prosperous
undertaker
than
of
anything
else
in
his
peculiar
profession
he
was
known
to
be
a
shrewd
and
practised
man
he
was
shown
into
one
of
the
smaller
no
sooner
had
edward
conroy
entered
it
and
sat
down
than
meath
arose
and
satisfied
himself
that
the
door
was
really
shut
and
that
no
one
was
hidden
behind
the
curtains
excuse
these
little
precautions
sir
he
said
with
his
deferential
smile
but
i
have
more
than
once
had
occasion
to
prove
the
value
of
them
oh
no
doubt
your
telegram
stated
that
you
had
some
news
for
me
meath
added
conroy
i
have
some
news
for
you
sir
news
which
may
prove
of
importance
before
proceeding
any
further
in
the
matter
i
thought
it
would
be
as
well
to
let
you
know
the
result
already
arrived
at
and
take
your
instructions
with
regard
to
future
proceedings
hitching
his
chair
nearer
the
table
meath
drew
forth
a
little
box
from
one
of
his
pockets
here
is
the
he
said
as
he
opened
the
box
you
have
doubtless
observed
sir
that
it
is
of
rather
a
curious
and
uncommon
pattern
yes
if
you
remember
i
said
so
when
i
saw
you
in
town
on
examining
this
under
a
powerful
glass
continued
meath
i
presently
detected
what
i
felt
nearly
sure
could
be
nothing
less
than
the
private
mark
of
the
firm
that
had
manufactured
it
i
took
the
link
to
the
foreman
of
a
large
firm
of
jewellers
with
whom
i
had
had
some
transactions
previously
and
he
at
once
confirmed
my
view
could
be
no
doubt
it
was
the
manufacturer
mark
he
said
the
question
was
who
were
the
manufacturers
he
did
not
know
he
did
not
know
sir
but
he
thought
he
might
be
able
to
find
out
if
i
would
leave
the
link
with
him
for
a
couple
of
days
which
i
agreed
to
and
did
he
asked
conroy
the
officer
solemnly
nodded
at
the
end
of
the
couple
of
days
he
sent
for
me
sir
and
told
me
he
had
discovered
the
private
mark
to
be
that
of
wooler
and
wooler
of
piccadilly
an
eminent
firm
as
perhaps
you
know
mr
conroy
i
have
heard
the
name
to
wooler
i
accordingly
went
disclosed
as
much
of
the
affair
to
them
as
was
necessary
and
stated
what
i
wanted
to
know
they
were
most
obliging
and
at
once
promised
to
consult
their
books
yesterday
they
sent
for
me
they
had
found
from
their
books
that
the
i
now
hold
in
my
hand
was
one
of
a
pair
which
together
with
various
other
articles
of
which
they
were
good
enough
to
furnish
me
with
a
list
and
description
had
been
supplied
by
them
about
four
years
ago
to
a
certain
major
piper
then
living
at
cheltenham
may
i
ask
you
sir
whether
you
happen
to
be
acquainted
with
any
such
gentleman
or
whether
he
is
known
in
this
neighbourhood
concluded
the
speaker
after
making
a
brief
pause
i
am
not
and
i
can
not
tell
you
whether
he
is
known
in
the
neighbourhood
i
am
nearly
a
stranger
to
it
myself
but
i
can
inquire
of
the
ladies
here
added
conroy
rising
to
quit
the
room
he
returned
saying
that
miss
winter
did
not
know
anyone
of
the
name
toynbee
did
she
had
met
a
major
piper
once
or
twice
in
society
but
not
lately
and
she
believed
him
to
be
a
highly
respectable
man
i
have
the
major
address
at
cheltenham
in
my
said
meath
or
rather
what
was
his
address
four
years
ago
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
may
have
gone
away
from
the
town
or
have
died
in
the
interim
very
possible
indeed
answered
conroy
it
rests
with
you
to
decide
whether
you
think
it
worth
while
to
proceed
any
farther
in
the
case
if
this
major
piper
be
still
at
cheltenham
there
will
not
be
any
difficulty
in
finding
him
if
he
is
not
there
may
be
especially
should
it
turn
out
that
he
is
what
we
call
a
shady
individual
difficulty
and
also
expense
having
gone
so
far
i
certainly
think
we
ought
to
go
farther
answered
conroy
are
you
not
of
that
opinion
yourself
i
am
sir
but
as
i
say
it
is
for
you
to
decide
we
have
got
hold
of
a
clue
of
some
sort
whether
it
will
lead
us
up
to
what
we
want
to
know
time
and
perseverance
only
can
prove
i
certainly
think
major
piper
ought
to
be
found
as
to
expense
i
gave
you
for
that
when
i
was
in
london
then
i
will
proceed
in
the
matter
without
delay
said
meath
rising
and
i
hope
sir
i
shall
shortly
have
something
further
to
report
to
you
you
will
take
something
before
you
go
away
said
conroy
ringing
the
bell
putting
down
the
hat
he
had
taken
up
meath
acknowledged
that
he
would
be
glad
of
something
a
tray
of
refreshments
was
brought
in
and
presently
he
had
departed
as
silently
as
he
had
come
a
few
days
elapsed
during
a
portion
of
which
edward
conroy
was
away
upon
his
own
affairs
close
upon
his
return
meath
again
made
his
way
to
heron
dyke
calling
as
before
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
miss
winter
had
grown
anxious
as
to
the
result
of
the
inquiries
and
she
told
edward
conroy
that
she
should
like
to
be
present
during
the
interview
if
there
were
no
objection
there
was
no
objection
conroy
said
and
took
her
into
the
room
with
him
they
all
sat
down
together
i
have
been
more
successful
than
i
ventured
to
anticipate
began
meath
in
his
slow
way
which
edward
conroy
somewhat
impatiently
interrupted
then
you
have
found
major
piper
i
have
found
major
piper
sir
i
had
very
little
difficulty
in
finding
him
he
is
not
at
cheltenham
now
he
is
at
bath
though
cheltenham
is
his
general
place
of
residence
major
piper
is
a
retired
indian
officer
well
known
and
respected
and
the
account
of
the
interview
may
possibly
read
less
complicated
if
related
as
it
took
place
instead
of
as
repeated
by
meath
he
saw
major
piper
at
his
lodgings
at
bath
a
little
man
who
had
one
of
his
gouty
feet
swathed
in
flannel
meath
disclosed
his
business
and
put
the
malachite
and
gold
into
his
hands
the
major
recognised
it
at
once
and
smiled
with
pleasure
ah
said
he
i
do
forget
this
it
formed
one
out
of
a
dozen
or
so
small
articles
of
value
which
disappeared
from
my
at
cheltenham
under
mysterious
circumstances
it
was
about
yes
about
four
years
ago
i
had
bought
the
jewellery
in
london
intending
it
as
a
present
to
my
nephew
on
his
birthday
however
the
very
evening
before
it
was
to
have
been
sent
off
the
things
disappeared
from
my
had
you
any
suspicions
as
to
who
could
have
taken
them
inquired
meath
no
i
was
utterly
nonplussed
and
am
so
still
when
i
think
of
it
answered
the
major
i
had
some
friends
that
night
at
my
rooms
just
enough
to
make
up
a
couple
of
rubbers
all
gentlemen
of
position
who
were
more
or
less
known
to
me
early
in
the
evening
when
telling
them
what
i
had
bought
for
my
nephew
my
man
tompkins
brought
in
the
at
my
desire
and
passed
round
the
jewellery
for
the
different
guests
to
look
at
after
that
tompkins
took
it
away
and
put
it
back
where
he
had
found
it
in
one
of
the
deep
drawers
in
my
but
without
locking
it
up
not
indeed
seeing
any
necessity
for
doing
so
he
i
presume
sir
your
man
was
trustworthy
interrupted
the
listener
perfectly
so
tompkins
had
been
with
me
for
years
in
india
and
is
with
me
still
the
loss
troubled
him
i
think
more
than
it
troubled
me
not
of
course
that
i
cared
to
lose
the
things
did
any
of
the
gentlemen
enter
your
during
the
evening
dear
me
yes
it
adjoined
the
and
some
of
them
were
in
and
out
candles
were
alight
in
it
well
the
next
day
when
the
small
case
of
jewellery
came
to
be
looked
for
it
was
nowhere
to
be
found
nor
so
far
as
i
am
aware
has
anything
been
heard
of
it
from
that
day
to
this
sir
said
meath
was
it
possible
that
any
person
could
have
had
access
to
your
in
the
course
of
the
evening
while
you
and
your
visitors
were
busy
at
the
no
that
could
not
be
answered
major
piper
to
get
access
to
the
they
must
have
passed
through
the
room
where
we
sat
or
else
through
a
little
anteroom
on
the
other
side
of
the
and
tompkins
sat
in
the
the
whole
evening
long
did
you
put
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
the
police
inquired
meath
i
had
it
inquired
into
privately
by
the
police
replied
the
major
but
i
would
not
allow
it
to
be
made
public
on
the
one
hand
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
suspect
my
servant
while
on
the
other
i
did
not
choose
to
have
it
thought
that
i
suspected
any
of
my
guests
it
was
a
most
disagreeable
affair
and
worried
me
a
good
deal
at
the
time
i
was
always
hoping
that
something
might
turn
up
but
i
suppose
it
has
grown
too
late
in
the
day
to
expect
it
now
i
do
know
that
said
meath
this
may
prove
the
connecting
link
between
your
robbery
and
the
still
darker
crime
recently
enacted
at
heron
dyke
that
is
it
may
lead
to
the
discovery
of
both
perpetrators
who
may
prove
to
have
been
one
and
the
same
man
will
you
sir
oblige
me
with
the
names
of
the
gentlemen
so
far
as
your
memory
serves
who
made
up
your
on
the
night
of
the
loss
there
can
be
no
objection
to
my
doing
that
said
the
major
and
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
it
may
prove
of
use
to
you
i
can
tell
you
every
name
for
the
night
and
its
doings
lie
with
unfaded
impression
on
my
memory
meath
took
down
the
names
from
his
dictation
as
well
as
the
date
when
the
robbery
occurred
they
all
appeared
to
be
men
of
standing
most
of
them
of
undeniable
connections
two
of
them
backhouse
and
my
old
comrade
sir
marcus
gunn
are
dead
remarked
the
major
of
the
others
two
are
living
in
cheltenham
one
lives
abroad
attaché
to
an
embassy
and
one
or
two
have
passed
out
of
my
knowledge
they
may
be
living
anywhere
the
world
is
wide
will
you
point
out
those
one
or
two
to
me
asked
meath
and
major
piper
did
so
such
was
the
substance
of
the
narrative
meath
had
now
to
relate
at
heron
dyke
i
have
brought
the
list
of
names
with
me
he
added
to
conroy
when
he
finished
perhaps
sir
you
and
this
lady
will
be
good
enough
to
look
at
it
and
to
tell
me
whether
any
one
of
the
gentlemen
is
known
in
this
neighbourhood
edward
conroy
took
the
paper
handed
to
him
and
ran
his
eyes
over
the
list
but
without
the
least
expectation
of
finding
on
it
any
name
that
he
should
recognise
meath
watched
him
with
a
kind
of
suppressed
eagerness
tamberlin
read
out
conroy
in
a
muttered
tone
backhouse
sir
gunton
cleeve
and
before
speaking
the
next
name
he
came
to
a
dead
standstill
meath
the
suppressed
eagerness
still
in
his
eyes
smiled
grimly
to
himself
when
he
saw
conroy
start
of
surprise
for
a
moment
conroy
stared
at
the
name
which
he
had
not
yet
spoken
in
speechless
amazement
then
recovering
himself
he
passed
the
paper
to
miss
winter
without
a
word
simply
pointing
with
his
forefinger
to
the
name
oh
impossible
exclaimed
ella
her
tone
full
of
fright
her
face
turning
white
as
death
madam
interposed
meath
detecting
her
emotion
it
does
not
follow
that
because
a
gentleman
may
have
been
wearing
these
now
he
was
the
one
to
steal
them
from
major
piper
the
thief
may
have
sold
them
and
he
bought
them
legitimately
but
see
you
not
sir
cried
ella
grasping
the
case
mentally
that
if
this
gentleman
made
one
of
the
major
guests
that
evening
and
it
was
he
who
lost
the
link
in
the
struggle
here
with
hubert
stone
she
paused
unable
to
continue
meath
slowly
nodded
his
head
yes
madam
i
see
the
difficulties
if
this
gentleman
is
indeed
known
here
known
here
why
he
lives
here
interrupted
ella
oh
edward
it
can
not
can
not
be
my
dear
you
go
to
toynbee
whispered
her
lover
say
nothing
to
her
leave
me
to
deal
with
this
but
edward
surely
you
will
not
accuse
him
she
cried
aloud
of
course
i
will
not
it
may
be
that
this
dreadful
suspicion
can
be
cleared
away
meath
looking
at
that
able
man
must
make
it
his
business
to
ascertain
first
of
all
if
he
can
whether
grounds
for
accusing
him
exist
and
opening
the
door
for
her
to
pass
out
conroy
resumed
his
seat
at
the
table
again
meath
left
the
hall
as
quietly
as
he
had
entered
it
edward
conroy
joined
the
ladies
and
found
that
not
a
word
had
been
spoken
to
toynbee
he
stayed
to
dine
with
them
the
winter
afternoon
had
deepened
to
a
still
close
evening
when
conroy
once
more
took
his
way
to
the
north
wing
for
his
watchings
there
had
not
ceased
before
quitting
the
hall
for
the
night
the
incident
of
the
afternoon
had
disturbed
him
greatly
while
miss
winter
felt
thoroughly
upset
his
thoughts
were
bent
upon
it
as
he
passed
silently
through
the
passages
of
katherine
keen
this
night
he
never
once
thought
perambulating
the
still
and
deserted
corridors
his
mind
utterly
preoccupied
he
came
last
of
all
to
the
gallery
he
knew
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
wing
by
this
time
and
could
find
his
way
about
it
in
the
dark
almost
as
readily
as
by
daylight
in
one
corner
of
the
gallery
was
an
old
oak
chair
and
on
this
he
now
sat
down
almost
without
being
aware
of
what
he
did
meath
news
was
working
in
his
brain
bringing
him
disquiet
and
perplexity
he
might
have
sat
for
five
minutes
or
for
twenty
he
could
not
tell
which
afterwards
when
the
deathlike
silence
that
brooded
over
the
place
was
suddenly
broken
all
at
once
a
low
sweet
wailing
voice
spoke
through
the
darkness
a
woman
voice
with
tears
in
it
oh
why
do
you
come
to
me
how
much
longer
must
i
wait
only
those
few
words
and
then
utter
silence
again
conroy
started
to
his
feet
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
he
had
been
so
immersed
in
his
sombre
meditations
he
was
so
utterly
taken
unawares
that
he
was
altogether
at
a
loss
to
know
from
which
direction
the
voice
had
come
whether
from
the
right
hand
or
the
left
whether
from
above
or
below
he
stood
without
moving
for
what
seemed
to
him
a
number
of
minutes
hoping
to
hear
the
voice
again
or
the
sound
of
footsteps
or
some
other
token
of
a
living
presence
but
in
vain
he
listened
he
heard
a
door
clash
faintly
in
another
wing
of
the
house
but
nothing
more
he
was
alone
with
the
silence
and
the
darkness
when
convinced
that
his
remaining
there
longer
would
be
useless
he
went
slowly
down
the
dark
shallow
stairs
which
led
below
it
would
never
do
to
tell
ella
in
what
manner
he
had
been
disturbed
she
had
enough
of
other
troubles
to
occupy
her
thoughts
at
present
none
the
less
was
edward
conroy
determined
to
fathom
the
mystery
of
the
north
wing
if
it
were
possible
for
man
to
do
so
chapter
vii
a
stranger
at
the
rose
and
crown
carlyon
sat
in
the
of
her
pleasant
house
at
bayswater
planning
out
in
her
own
mind
the
route
she
should
take
on
her
journey
to
hyères
for
which
place
she
intended
to
depart
ere
many
days
had
elapsed
when
the
morning
letters
were
brought
in
one
of
them
was
from
her
niece
ella
winter
carlyon
opened
it
and
sat
transfixed
at
the
news
it
contained
nothing
less
than
an
avowal
from
that
young
lady
that
she
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
edward
conroy
the
shock
and
surprise
sent
carlyon
into
norfolk
she
gave
orders
to
her
maid
higson
to
prepare
for
their
instant
departure
and
it
is
just
as
well
that
i
should
go
on
another
score
she
told
herself
as
she
stepped
into
her
carriage
to
be
driven
to
the
station
to
ascertain
whether
my
niece
has
relinquished
that
most
absurd
idea
of
hers
that
she
is
not
her
uncle
gilbert
legal
inheritor
what
a
ridiculous
world
we
live
in
so
at
a
late
hour
that
same
evening
carlyon
with
her
maid
arrived
at
heron
dyke
without
any
notice
your
letter
ella
took
my
breath
away
she
began
hardly
allowing
herself
a
moment
for
greetings
has
this
engagement
which
you
tell
me
of
really
gone
so
far
that
it
can
not
be
broken
off
but
who
wants
it
to
be
broken
off
aunt
gertrude
returned
ella
what
consider
my
dear
a
newspaper
reporter
for
conroy
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
that
a
very
nice
gentlemanly
young
man
i
admit
and
one
who
has
made
himself
a
name
in
a
certain
way
but
scarcely
a
match
for
the
heiress
of
heron
dyke
i
am
not
going
to
marry
for
ambition
aunt
but
for
for
love
i
conclude
you
would
say
love
may
be
all
very
well
in
its
way
but
why
not
have
combined
the
two
your
husband
ought
to
be
at
least
your
equal
in
position
with
your
fortune
and
good
looks
you
might
have
aspired
to
marry
into
the
peerage
at
the
very
least
you
ought
to
have
a
husband
with
a
seat
in
parliament
i
am
very
much
disappointed
concluded
carlyon
sitting
down
on
the
nearest
chair
i
am
sorry
for
that
aunt
and
so
will
conroy
be
my
dear
surely
you
will
not
be
so
foolish
as
to
tell
him
cried
carlyon
hastily
what
i
say
to
you
is
strictly
between
ourselves
i
like
conroy
very
well
i
like
him
so
well
that
i
should
not
care
to
hurt
his
feelings
although
he
has
ambitiously
cast
his
eyes
on
you
i
am
afraid
aunt
he
could
not
help
liking
me
he
said
so
i
dare
say
well
perhaps
that
may
be
true
if
he
were
but
or
a
landed
proprietor
say
or
even
a
rising
man
in
the
law
courts
or
in
short
almost
anything
but
a
newspaper
reporter
there
is
no
one
i
would
sooner
see
you
marry
but
as
he
is
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
him
as
he
is
aunt
gertrude
and
you
must
please
remember
added
ella
with
a
quaint
little
smile
that
it
was
at
your
house
i
first
met
him
do
you
remember
with
what
you
introduced
him
to
me
he
was
quite
the
lion
of
the
evening
you
made
him
so
still
of
course
as
you
say
he
was
only
a
newspaper
reporter
carlyon
fidgeted
in
her
chair
one
may
be
gratified
to
receive
a
person
as
a
visitor
she
said
but
it
does
not
follow
that
one
cares
to
make
him
a
member
of
family
as
to
that
evening
i
have
hated
to
think
of
it
ever
since
for
it
was
when
my
jewels
were
stolen
and
now
i
shall
hate
it
still
more
but
to
return
to
the
point
you
the
mistress
of
heron
dyke
am
i
the
true
mistress
of
heron
dyke
or
rather
shall
i
continue
to
be
interrupted
ella
i
will
not
hear
a
word
of
that
nonsense
flashed
carlyon
my
dear
i
speak
of
you
as
you
are
and
i
say
that
it
is
positively
not
seemly
for
a
young
lady
in
your
position
to
wed
a
poor
newspaper
reporter
ella
put
her
arms
round
her
aunt
neck
and
kissed
her
maxims
do
not
come
with
a
good
grace
from
your
lips
aunt
gertrude
she
whispered
i
have
heard
you
say
many
a
time
that
your
marriage
was
one
of
pure
affection
but
i
have
never
heard
you
say
that
you
regretted
it
you
must
let
me
be
happy
in
my
own
unambitious
way
carlyon
sighed
how
differently
the
young
and
the
old
look
at
things
and
how
impossible
it
is
to
reconcile
the
views
not
that
she
regretted
her
own
choice
and
she
supposed
she
should
have
to
put
up
with
this
one
ella
was
her
own
mistress
under
no
control
is
it
quite
irrevocable
my
love
i
think
so
auntie
dear
you
can
ask
mr
conroy
irrevocable
carlyon
found
it
to
be
after
a
short
while
given
to
private
lamentation
she
resolved
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
she
did
so
with
a
good
grace
one
very
powerful
advocate
in
her
mind
was
edward
conroy
himself
she
could
not
help
liking
him
admiring
him
she
mentally
acknowledged
that
were
she
a
young
woman
with
a
virgin
heart
it
would
have
been
lost
to
conroy
after
frankly
telling
him
that
she
did
not
approve
of
the
match
on
account
of
his
want
of
position
but
that
she
could
not
and
should
not
take
any
steps
to
hinder
it
she
became
pleasant
with
him
as
before
conroy
received
the
rebuke
with
becoming
humility
but
he
did
not
offer
to
relinquish
miss
winter
now
that
she
was
at
heron
dyke
carlyon
determined
to
remain
with
conroy
at
the
hall
every
day
she
considered
it
her
duty
to
be
at
hand
to
afford
proper
countenance
and
support
to
ella
toynbee
was
all
very
well
but
she
was
not
a
relative
and
duty
was
duty
with
carlyon
her
cough
must
take
its
chance
this
winter
it
was
possible
that
the
bracing
air
of
the
east
coast
might
prove
as
beneficial
to
her
in
the
as
the
but
relaxing
breezes
of
southern
france
and
so
she
settled
down
in
the
old
house
to
stay
there
as
long
as
might
be
expedient
when
charles
plackett
was
at
heron
dyke
he
had
promised
to
write
to
miss
winter
as
soon
as
he
had
communicated
with
his
client
of
nunham
priors
instead
of
charles
plackett
writing
denison
himself
wrote
and
the
following
is
what
he
said
nunham
priors
my
dear
young
kinswoman
you
have
often
been
in
my
thoughts
since
i
saw
you
in
london
now
some
weeks
ago
and
i
look
forward
with
great
pleasure
to
your
promised
visit
to
me
at
nunham
priors
next
spring
when
in
town
last
week
i
saw
my
lawyer
charles
plackett
who
gave
me
a
long
account
of
his
visit
to
you
at
heron
dyke
that
visit
was
undertaken
by
him
solely
on
his
own
responsibility
and
without
first
consulting
me
as
he
ought
to
have
done
i
have
the
utmost
confidence
in
plackett
good
sense
and
business
qualifications
but
whether
i
should
have
sanctioned
his
visiting
you
for
such
a
purpose
is
a
question
i
will
not
now
enter
upon
what
has
been
done
can
not
be
undone
and
all
i
can
now
do
my
dear
is
to
thank
you
and
express
to
you
the
admiration
i
feel
for
the
frank
and
candid
spirit
in
which
you
met
his
inquiries
as
i
told
plackett
many
people
under
such
circumstances
would
have
shown
him
the
door
i
myself
should
probably
have
done
so
were
i
in
your
place
my
dear
young
lady
i
should
stir
no
further
in
the
matter
respecting
which
plackett
called
upon
you
you
have
done
everything
that
honour
demands
and
more
than
could
be
expected
of
you
under
the
circumstances
moreover
it
appears
to
me
that
though
i
admit
one
can
not
help
entertaining
doubts
any
further
investigation
would
probably
bring
forth
no
results
whatever
let
the
affair
rest
that
is
my
advice
to
you
i
have
no
particular
ambition
to
be
the
master
of
heron
dyke
especially
now
that
i
have
learnt
to
know
and
love
aye
love
my
dear
her
who
is
its
mistress
i
have
fortune
enough
and
to
spare
both
for
myself
and
that
scapegrace
boy
who
will
succeed
me
why
crave
for
more
a
very
little
while
and
i
must
leave
it
however
much
or
however
little
it
may
be
do
forget
that
i
shall
expect
you
at
nunham
priors
in
spring
and
so
for
the
present
no
more
from
your
affectionate
kinsman
gilbert
denison
i
am
expecting
frank
home
in
a
week
or
two
i
shall
try
to
chain
him
by
the
leg
until
you
come
i
am
anxious
that
you
and
he
should
be
well
acquainted
with
one
another
oh
indeed
exclaimed
conroy
as
he
read
this
letter
with
an
amused
smile
for
miss
winter
handed
it
to
him
when
he
came
to
the
hall
on
the
morning
she
received
it
it
is
evident
denison
has
made
up
his
mind
that
you
should
fall
in
love
with
this
mythical
son
of
his
she
nodded
after
all
ella
would
not
that
seem
to
be
a
most
sensible
arrangement
it
would
unite
the
two
branches
of
the
family
and
concentrate
the
property
of
both
what
a
pity
you
have
given
away
your
heart
to
the
wrong
man
i
begin
to
think
so
too
gravely
answered
ella
it
may
not
be
too
late
to
reclaim
the
poor
thing
and
give
it
as
you
suggest
it
is
never
well
to
be
rash
had
you
not
better
await
the
return
of
this
wandering
relative
perhaps
he
might
not
value
the
offering
but
if
he
should
value
it
he
may
not
value
it
as
as
its
present
possessor
does
i
dare
say
he
would
sir
in
that
case
should
you
wish
to
reclaim
it
you
shall
have
it
back
ella
glanced
up
do
you
mean
what
you
say
is
it
a
bargain
undoubtedly
and
conroy
appeared
to
speak
without
reservation
is
he
tiring
of
me
thought
ella
shall
you
take
denison
advice
and
let
the
matter
of
the
succession
drop
resumed
conroy
after
a
pause
certainly
not
you
would
not
wish
me
to
would
you
no
i
think
if
any
fraud
was
enacted
it
should
be
traced
out
and
exposed
i
have
always
said
so
but
do
you
know
i
have
chiefly
wished
it
why
have
you
for
your
own
peace
dear
i
see
you
will
have
none
until
the
matter
shall
be
set
at
rest
that
is
true
that
is
true
she
impressively
answered
but
oh
edward
what
can
we
do
what
can
we
do
more
than
we
have
already
done
nothing
that
i
see
at
present
it
does
not
much
matter
one
way
or
the
other
do
you
mean
that
my
title
to
the
estate
or
does
not
matter
not
much
i
say
i
do
not
understand
you
this
morning
edward
conroy
smiled
you
will
understand
me
better
sometime
that
i
am
sure
i
never
shall
if
i
am
to
marry
that
young
denison
yes
you
will
despite
young
denison
returned
conroy
the
same
provoking
smile
still
upon
his
lips
it
was
known
that
ducie
had
been
suffering
from
a
severe
cold
suddenly
without
bidding
to
anyone
she
started
for
london
with
the
object
as
was
understood
of
obtaining
better
medical
advice
nullington
hoped
she
would
obtain
that
and
be
restored
to
health
for
she
was
rather
a
favourite
ducie
did
not
return
and
the
next
piece
of
news
heard
was
that
her
miniature
phaeton
together
with
its
pair
of
ponies
had
been
bought
by
lord
camberley
and
presented
to
his
aunt
the
hon
featherstone
from
this
gossips
argued
ducie
return
to
nullington
seemed
a
somewhat
problematical
event
captain
lennox
who
appeared
to
have
taken
up
his
abode
in
london
paying
the
lilacs
a
flying
visit
now
and
then
in
by
the
and
away
again
in
the
morning
was
questioned
upon
the
point
he
said
ducie
continued
very
unwell
indeed
he
was
not
sure
but
she
would
have
to
go
abroad
if
so
he
might
perhaps
accompany
her
it
might
have
been
from
this
item
of
problematical
news
that
a
report
got
about
that
the
captain
was
also
about
to
leave
nullington
he
himself
neither
denied
it
nor
affirmed
it
it
would
depend
he
said
on
his
sister
health
one
evening
when
the
captain
had
come
down
for
a
rather
longer
stay
than
usual
now
he
went
into
the
at
the
rose
and
crown
lennox
was
a
man
who
could
not
exist
without
society
or
spend
an
evening
at
home
with
no
company
but
his
own
after
the
captain
had
played
a
few
games
with
young
sandys
of
denne
park
and
was
about
to
quit
the
hotel
the
landlord
butterby
drew
him
aside
can
i
speak
with
you
a
moment
sir
well
cried
the
captain
shortly
pardon
me
captain
for
asking
but
would
you
mind
telling
me
whether
there
any
truth
in
the
report
that
you
are
about
to
leave
the
lilacs
what
if
there
should
be
eh
asked
the
captain
with
a
quick
suspicious
glance
at
his
questioner
why
simply
this
sir
replied
the
landlord
that
i
think
i
know
of
somebody
who
might
perhaps
take
it
off
your
hands
furniture
and
all
oh
indeed
who
that
asked
the
captain
a
norris
sir
who
is
stopping
in
the
hotel
he
says
what
his
business
here
nothing
in
particular
sir
halted
here
quite
promiscuous
yesterday
been
going
about
a
bit
to
see
places
he
not
a
gentleman
by
any
means
added
the
landlord
i
hope
i
know
a
gentleman
when
i
see
one
captain
but
he
seems
to
have
plenty
of
money
retired
from
business
i
should
put
it
says
he
should
like
to
settle
down
in
this
part
of
the
country
for
it
takes
his
fancy
and
is
on
the
for
what
he
calls
a
little
shanty
that
would
suit
himself
and
his
two
grown
up
daughters
so
i
thought
captain
that
if
i
understand
interrupted
lennox
in
his
quick
way
he
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
biting
his
lip
his
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
he
looks
awfully
ill
was
the
landlord
unspoken
thought
as
he
stood
watching
him
but
i
suppose
he
goes
the
pace
when
he
in
london
it
sure
to
tell
on
a
man
in
the
it
might
be
worth
my
while
to
see
this
norris
in
the
morning
said
lennox
breaking
out
of
his
reverie
to
tell
you
the
truth
butterby
i
some
notion
of
leaving
nullington
so
we
heard
but
i
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so
sir
nothing
however
is
settled
at
present
you
see
my
sister
finds
this
part
of
the
country
a
little
too
bleak
for
her
and
i
myself
have
been
out
of
sorts
for
some
time
we
have
some
idea
of
travelling
for
a
year
or
two
i
shall
see
how
she
is
when
i
next
run
up
to
town
we
may
perhaps
come
back
here
after
all
we
shall
miss
you
sir
if
you
do
spoke
butterby
captain
lennox
looked
undecided
as
if
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
a
minute
or
two
passed
before
he
spoke
you
might
take
an
opportunity
butterby
of
sounding
this
guest
of
yours
as
to
what
kind
of
place
it
is
that
he
really
wants
the
lilacs
might
be
too
small
for
him
or
two
expensive
it
might
not
suit
him
in
many
ways
in
that
case
my
seeing
him
on
the
matter
would
be
useless
i
will
look
round
in
the
morning
about
ten
and
then
you
can
tell
me
the
result
with
that
captain
lennox
adjusted
the
camellia
in
his
buttonhole
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
linked
his
arm
in
the
arm
of
young
sandys
and
went
his
way
captain
lennox
was
punctual
the
clock
was
striking
ten
the
next
morning
as
he
walked
into
the
bar
of
the
rose
and
crown
the
landlord
met
him
with
a
smiling
face
norris
would
like
to
see
you
sir
he
began
i
had
a
little
talk
with
him
last
night
and
from
what
i
can
make
out
if
you
can
come
to
terms
yours
will
be
just
the
place
to
suit
him
he
a
little
bit
odd
in
some
of
his
ways
but
a
pleasant
party
enough
when
you
come
to
converse
with
him
you
can
show
me
to
his
room
norris
was
a
tall
ungainly
man
dressed
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
a
country
squire
of
sporting
proclivities
with
cutaway
coat
gaiters
and
high
collar
but
his
clothes
sat
awkwardly
upon
him
and
he
seemed
ill
at
ease
in
them
he
rose
up
from
the
as
lennox
entered
the
room
and
waved
him
to
a
chair
proud
to
see
you
sir
he
said
shall
be
at
your
service
in
two
minutes
am
late
this
morning
do
hurry
yourself
said
captain
lennox
politely
but
norris
rang
the
bell
and
had
the
tray
taken
away
he
then
drew
his
chair
a
little
nearer
the
fire
so
that
he
might
face
his
guest
and
spread
his
big
bony
hands
out
to
the
cheerful
blaze
i
told
sir
that
you
have
a
little
shanty
you
are
about
to
vacate
he
said
and
as
i
in
want
of
something
of
the
kind
we
may
perhaps
strike
a
bargain
possibly
so
norris
but
it
might
be
waste
of
time
to
go
into
any
details
before
you
have
seen
the
place
i
may
tell
you
that
there
are
three
years
of
the
lease
still
to
run
and
that
i
should
like
the
furniture
to
be
taken
at
a
valuation
all
right
captain
if
the
place
suits
me
we
sha
quarrel
about
terms
i
dessay
when
shall
i
pay
you
a
visit
the
sooner
the
better
i
am
due
in
london
how
would
two
suit
you
you
would
then
have
time
to
look
over
the
cottage
before
dusk
and
you
might
favour
me
with
your
company
at
dinner
afterwards
if
not
otherwise
engaged
it
may
take
some
little
time
to
talk
over
preliminaries
all
right
captain
i
your
man
at
two
sharp
i
be
with
you
norris
was
as
good
as
his
word
a
fly
deposited
him
at
the
lilacs
at
the
time
appointed
where
he
found
captain
lennox
waiting
the
captain
went
with
him
over
the
premises
norris
made
a
very
minute
inspection
of
the
place
peering
into
every
nook
and
corner
and
examining
every
cupboard
and
pantry
in
the
house
about
the
condition
of
the
furniture
he
did
not
seem
to
trouble
himself
it
good
enough
for
me
and
my
lasses
he
said
with
a
wave
of
one
of
his
large
hands
when
lennox
observed
that
he
was
afraid
the
carpet
was
rather
well
worn
last
of
all
the
garden
and
grounds
were
thoroughly
perambulated
i
like
everything
i
seen
said
norris
as
they
went
back
indoors
but
before
giving
a
final
answer
i
must
hear
what
my
two
lasses
have
to
say
it
to
be
their
home
as
well
as
mine
you
know
captain
just
now
they
are
in
the
west
of
ireland
but
they
be
back
in
a
week
from
in
a
week
eh
perhaps
you
do
care
to
wait
so
long
as
that
for
my
answer
the
captain
replied
that
a
week
more
or
a
week
less
was
a
matter
of
very
slight
importance
to
him
so
it
was
left
at
that
when
dinner
was
announced
lennox
sat
down
with
his
guest
and
was
studiously
polite
though
he
did
not
seem
to
be
in
much
humour
for
talking
norris
however
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
did
not
let
the
conversation
flag
while
doing
ample
justice
to
the
good
things
before
him
he
allowed
no
hint
to
drop
as
to
what
his
profession
in
life
had
been
or
was
now
but
from
certain
things
he
said
lennox
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
man
who
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
world
and
had
been
acquainted
with
several
phases
of
life
of
a
more
or
less
curious
kind
dinner
over
young
sandys
and
three
or
four
other
men
dropped
in
there
was
an
adjournment
to
the
and
after
a
time
some
one
suggested
cards
do
you
play
mr
norris
asked
lennox
with
an
air
of
languid
interest
when
i
was
a
lad
at
home
we
used
to
play
loo
and
speculation
for
nuts
at
christmas
time
and
since
then
i
sometimes
played
a
rubber
of
whist
but
nothing
more
answered
norris
with
his
broad
smile
still
i
no
and
if
one
of
you
will
only
give
me
a
lesson
or
two
i
do
my
best
sandys
kindly
undertook
the
part
of
mentor
and
found
his
pupil
a
most
apt
one
in
about
ten
minutes
he
said
rather
drily
and
now
i
think
norris
you
will
be
quite
able
to
take
care
of
yourself
at
which
norris
nodded
his
head
during
the
early
part
of
the
evening
the
luck
seemed
decidedly
against
norris
but
there
came
a
change
and
his
lost
sovereigns
began
to
find
their
way
back
to
his
pocket
it
appeared
to
be
a
peculiarity
of
this
norris
that
whenever
he
sustained
a
more
severe
loss
than
ordinary
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
gave
vent
to
a
hearty
guffaw
whereas
when
the
cards
happened
to
be
in
his
favour
and
the
pool
fell
to
him
he
looked
as
glum
as
a
judge
young
sandys
stared
at
him
through
his
as
though
he
were
some
strange
animal
who
had
found
his
way
there
by
mistake
while
captain
cold
keen
glances
began
to
be
directed
more
and
more
frequently
towards
his
guest
it
was
dawning
on
the
captain
mind
that
norris
was
perhaps
not
so
much
of
a
novice
as
he
had
tried
to
make
himself
out
to
be
at
the
close
of
the
evening
he
rose
from
the
table
a
winner
to
a
small
amount
norris
was
the
first
to
leave
he
bowed
his
awkward
bow
to
the
company
generally
and
shook
hands
with
the
captain
everything
shall
be
settled
in
a
week
from
now
he
whispered
with
a
meaning
look
rely
upon
that
queer
fish
that
said
young
sandys
as
the
door
closed
on
norris
lanky
figure
not
quite
the
greenhorn
he
would
have
had
us
believe
remarked
gray
another
of
the
guests
where
the
deuce
did
you
pick
him
up
lennox
i
glad
he
gone
said
lennox
with
an
air
of
weariness
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
the
fellow
is
after
this
place
if
i
should
make
up
my
mind
to
leave
it
i
say
old
fellow
how
jolly
bad
you
look
said
downes
dyson
as
he
proceeded
to
shuffle
the
cards
yes
i
altogether
out
of
sorts
these
horrible
english
winters
are
enough
to
kill
anyone
captain
lennox
was
indeed
glad
that
norris
had
gone
and
he
would
have
been
well
pleased
were
he
never
going
to
see
him
again
he
had
contracted
a
great
dislike
for
him
for
which
he
could
give
no
reasonable
account
to
himself
a
sort
of
dread
which
had
grown
deeper
and
deeper
as
the
evening
had
advanced
and
he
could
not
shake
it
off
his
dreams
that
night
were
troubled
ones
through
the
whole
of
them
the
tall
gaunt
figure
of
norris
loomed
ominously
even
in
his
sleep
he
felt
that
he
hated
him
next
morning
the
captain
rose
unrefreshed
and
started
by
an
early
train
for
london
he
was
thinking
that
he
needed
a
different
air
from
the
english
air
just
as
greatly
as
his
sister
did
it
was
at
the
rose
and
crown
that
conroy
stayed
when
at
nullington
he
and
norris
had
once
or
twice
met
on
the
stairs
and
passed
each
other
as
strangers
on
the
evening
however
when
conroy
was
just
about
to
go
to
rest
a
tap
came
to
the
door
of
his
and
norris
appeared
at
it
i
thought
i
just
see
whether
you
had
retired
yet
sir
having
a
word
to
say
to
you
ah
is
it
you
mr
meath
said
conroy
come
in
you
have
some
news
for
me
i
presume
sit
down
what
is
it
the
news
i
have
at
present
sir
is
this
that
i
have
made
some
very
curious
discoveries
indeed
respecting
the
antecedents
of
the
gentleman
who
goes
by
the
name
of
captain
lennox
by
the
name
is
it
not
his
real
name
well
sir
he
has
gone
by
a
lot
of
names
in
his
time
but
which
of
them
his
real
one
is
best
known
to
himself
from
the
of
his
coat
meath
drew
a
small
and
opened
it
ten
years
ago
he
began
lennox
was
passing
under
the
name
of
blaydon
at
that
time
he
was
tuner
to
a
large
pianoforte
firm
in
london
this
situation
he
lost
because
a
number
of
valuable
articles
were
missed
from
different
houses
to
which
he
was
sent
we
next
hear
of
him
under
the
name
of
perke
as
at
a
fashionable
hotel
in
mayfair
here
also
some
robberies
were
perpetrated
but
whether
by
him
or
not
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
assert
in
any
case
he
lost
his
situation
before
long
after
this
he
appears
to
have
gone
abroad
for
two
or
three
years
and
was
seen
in
paris
brussels
homburg
and
other
places
in
some
way
or
other
probably
by
successful
gambling
he
seems
to
have
feathered
his
nest
pretty
considerably
we
next
find
him
at
cheltenham
at
cheltenham
involuntarily
exclaimed
conroy
at
cheltenham
sir
he
had
become
captain
lennox
then
and
was
a
very
big
card
being
captain
lennox
and
a
great
swell
he
is
of
course
above
peculations
unless
some
very
tempting
chance
offers
itself
as
in
the
case
of
major
piper
by
his
skill
at
cards
and
billiards
he
contrives
to
make
a
very
comfortable
income
he
entices
young
men
of
fortune
to
his
rooms
and
there
fleeces
them
do
you
follow
me
sir
quite
so
it
would
appear
that
he
at
length
becomes
fearful
that
cheltenham
is
growing
too
warm
for
him
and
he
wisely
beats
a
retreat
from
it
before
any
suspicion
touches
him
accompanied
by
his
sister
ducie
he
comes
to
norfolk
and
takes
the
lilacs
on
a
five
or
six
years
lease
it
would
seem
a
curious
place
to
come
to
remarked
meath
looking
off
his
for
a
moment
but
no
doubt
lennox
knew
what
he
was
about
and
i
have
very
little
doubt
that
the
scheme
has
paid
him
handsomely
he
must
have
known
that
there
were
many
young
men
of
family
in
this
part
of
the
country
some
of
them
with
more
money
than
brains
and
captain
lennox
having
more
brains
than
money
was
exactly
the
man
to
adjust
the
difference
it
is
a
pity
sir
a
great
pity
added
meath
with
a
solemn
shake
of
the
head
that
so
clever
a
rascal
did
not
stop
short
at
plucking
pigeons
and
leave
the
darker
paths
of
villany
untrodden
he
might
have
gone
on
living
as
a
gentleman
and
among
gentlemen
for
years
to
come
edward
conroy
had
been
thinking
there
were
some
discrepancies
in
this
history
you
speak
of
lennox
as
a
tuner
of
pianos
and
an
hotel
clerk
meath
but
he
is
undoubtedly
a
gentleman
both
as
regards
education
and
manners
i
think
he
must
have
been
born
one
little
doubt
of
that
sir
is
but
another
edition
of
the
old
story
i
take
it
parents
expensive
perhaps
good
launch
in
life
perhaps
not
good
through
lack
of
funds
then
temptation
weakness
ruin
repudiated
by
friends
or
perhaps
friends
dead
then
another
start
under
a
fresh
name
and
from
a
lower
rung
of
the
ladder
ah
my
dear
sir
such
cases
are
unfortunately
but
too
common
this
is
a
queer
world
yet
men
must
live
in
it
conroy
silently
assented
how
far
do
you
suppose
ducie
has
been
implicated
in
these
unpleasant
matters
the
private
detective
shook
his
head
sir
i
ca
answer
that
we
have
made
no
discovery
against
her
as
yet
neither
do
we
care
to
push
any
she
is
much
attached
to
her
brother
and
she
has
clung
to
him
in
her
sisterly
affection
it
can
hardly
be
that
she
has
lived
without
suspicion
any
way
as
to
his
making
money
by
fleecing
the
world
at
cards
whether
she
has
known
of
worse
things
i
ca
say
if
so
one
could
not
expect
her
to
denounce
him
but
she
must
have
walked
upon
thorns
i
suppose
she
is
really
a
widow
and
her
name
ducie
yes
sir
that
all
straightforward
enough
her
husband
was
an
officer
in
the
army
he
died
young
and
left
her
with
a
fair
income
which
is
hers
still
people
like
her
and
she
has
some
good
acquaintances
so
has
the
captain
for
that
matter
what
do
you
purpose
doing
next
asked
conroy
well
sir
my
next
move
though
i
do
say
when
it
will
take
place
either
this
day
or
that
day
will
be
to
apply
for
a
and
go
quietly
over
the
lilacs
into
every
nook
and
corner
of
it
with
any
particular
object
in
view
yes
sir
a
very
particular
one
i
hope
to
find
there
a
malachite
and
gold
to
match
the
one
that
was
found
upon
the
gravel
at
heron
dyke
conroy
almost
smiled
this
appeared
to
him
to
be
so
improbable
a
hope
you
can
not
expect
to
find
it
knowing
as
he
must
have
known
that
he
had
lost
the
one
in
the
struggle
with
hubert
stone
lennox
first
care
would
be
to
effectually
hide
its
fellow
let
me
tell
you
conroy
that
the
chances
are
he
these
criminals
are
always
making
some
fatal
mistake
and
that
a
very
common
one
the
not
doing
away
effectually
as
you
are
pleased
to
term
it
sir
and
it
an
apt
word
with
the
proofs
that
might
destroy
them
chapter
viii
together
at
last
sundry
matters
had
been
taking
place
concerning
philip
cleeve
which
might
well
have
been
told
previously
it
was
on
a
wednesday
morning
as
may
be
remembered
that
philip
started
for
london
on
business
as
lady
cleeve
was
led
to
suppose
connected
with
tiplady
office
on
thursday
evening
lady
cleeve
waited
up
to
welcome
her
son
return
but
philip
did
not
come
he
must
be
staying
in
town
to
spend
the
evening
with
bootle
she
said
to
herself
i
shall
have
a
letter
in
the
morning
the
morning
brought
neither
letter
nor
messages
from
the
truant
and
lady
cleeve
sent
her
breakfast
away
nearly
untasted
after
all
she
thought
seeing
that
he
will
return
he
probably
hardly
thought
it
worth
while
to
write
but
when
friday
evening
passed
away
and
still
philip
came
not
and
when
saturday
morning
post
brought
her
no
letter
then
lady
cleeve
became
seriously
alarmed
business
might
of
course
be
detaining
him
she
knew
that
but
why
did
he
not
write
and
philip
as
she
believed
was
so
i
will
send
to
tiplady
and
risk
it
she
thought
she
would
have
sent
to
inquire
before
only
philip
had
so
intense
a
dislike
to
being
what
he
called
looked
after
once
when
he
had
stayed
away
at
norwich
a
day
or
two
beyond
the
time
of
coming
home
she
had
gone
herself
to
the
office
to
ask
about
him
and
philip
was
annoyed
about
it
bridget
she
said
calling
to
the
maid
who
had
waited
upon
her
for
many
years
and
who
was
as
well
known
in
nullington
as
lady
cleeve
herself
you
had
better
go
and
inquire
at
the
office
when
they
expect
philip
home
you
can
say
if
you
like
that
i
am
a
little
uneasy
at
not
hearing
from
him
away
went
bridget
in
her
warm
scotch
plaid
shawl
and
black
bonnet
tiplady
was
standing
at
the
looking
up
and
down
the
street
bridget
delivered
to
him
her
message
lady
cleeve
sent
you
to
me
to
inquire
about
the
movements
of
philip
cried
the
architect
after
listening
i
was
just
going
to
send
to
ask
lady
cleeve
the
same
question
this
famous
architect
renowned
in
more
counties
than
one
was
a
kindly
unpretending
man
small
and
slight
and
chary
of
speech
in
general
he
took
off
his
hat
to
push
back
the
few
scanty
grey
hairs
left
on
his
head
as
he
looked
at
the
servant
my
lady
thought
sir
that
you
must
know
what
was
keeping
philip
so
long
in
london
i
know
nothing
about
it
bridget
i
do
know
why
he
went
his
absence
is
causing
us
some
inconvenience
bridget
who
was
much
in
her
mistress
confidence
could
not
make
this
out
he
went
upon
business
for
you
sir
did
he
not
not
at
all
best
here
got
a
note
from
him
on
wednesday
morning
saying
he
had
to
run
up
to
town
on
a
little
business
but
should
be
back
the
following
day
we
have
heard
nothing
of
him
since
make
my
compliments
to
your
lady
and
tell
her
this
lady
cleeve
became
actively
alarmed
now
all
sorts
of
dire
forebodings
filled
the
mother
heart
london
was
a
place
beset
with
dangers
in
many
ways
she
had
heard
and
fully
believed
that
hardly
a
day
passed
but
somebody
or
other
was
lost
in
it
and
that
they
were
never
heard
of
again
sending
out
to
order
a
fly
she
was
set
down
at
the
office
tiplady
was
in
his
private
room
then
and
handed
her
to
a
seat
i
would
be
only
too
glad
to
tell
you
what
is
detaining
him
if
i
knew
said
the
little
man
kindly
in
answer
to
her
somewhat
impassioned
appeal
we
supposed
he
had
gone
up
upon
some
matter
for
yourself
lost
lost
no
no
dear
lady
cleeve
do
imagine
anything
so
improbable
as
that
philip
is
quite
old
enough
to
take
care
of
himself
but
what
can
he
have
gone
to
london
for
and
why
should
he
have
made
a
mystery
of
it
well
to
say
the
truth
that
what
i
can
not
quite
understand
best
said
a
word
to
me
this
morning
he
got
it
from
young
plympton
i
fancy
that
philip
had
been
embarking
money
in
some
speculation
and
do
you
know
anything
about
it
nothing
said
lady
cleeve
whose
face
was
growing
more
anxious
with
every
moment
i
call
best
in
said
the
architect
but
upon
going
into
an
adjoining
room
he
found
that
best
had
stepped
out
so
he
brought
in
richard
plympton
this
young
man
who
had
been
placed
in
the
architect
office
as
an
improver
was
brother
to
kettle
curate
and
was
a
great
friend
of
philip
young
plympton
after
shaking
hands
with
lady
cleeve
told
what
he
knew
thinking
it
right
under
present
circumstances
to
do
so
that
philip
had
bought
some
shares
in
a
rich
company
the
hermandad
and
that
he
had
gone
up
to
town
to
see
if
he
could
not
sell
out
again
oh
said
tiplady
embarked
money
in
that
has
he
i
heard
that
same
mine
spoken
of
yesterday
quite
incidentally
it
is
a
very
rich
mine
is
it
not
sir
cried
young
plympton
with
enthusiasm
very
drily
responded
the
architect
captain
lennox
got
him
the
shares
sir
he
is
one
of
the
directors
and
has
gone
in
for
it
himself
largely
sorry
for
him
cried
tiplady
the
mine
has
come
to
grief
no
exclaimed
the
young
man
opening
his
eyes
widely
you
mean
that
sir
then
a
thought
striking
him
it
must
be
that
which
has
been
keeping
lennox
so
much
in
town
lately
ay
no
doubt
that
will
do
plympton
i
wonder
whether
philip
has
risked
much
upon
this
worthless
thing
added
the
architect
to
lady
cleeve
as
his
clerk
withdrew
it
is
sad
news
for
me
she
sighed
wiping
her
pale
face
we
can
soon
ascertain
by
inquiring
at
the
bank
how
much
money
he
has
drawn
out
of
course
anything
is
better
than
that
he
should
be
lost
of
course
smiled
tiplady
still
i
do
myself
see
why
this
matter
should
be
keeping
philip
in
london
it
has
been
known
to
the
public
some
days
now
shall
i
make
the
inquiry
at
the
bank
for
you
lady
cleeve
if
you
will
take
the
trouble
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
i
may
want
your
authority
before
they
answer
me
i
not
quite
sure
though
they
know
me
for
philip
good
friend
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
get
into
the
fly
now
with
lady
cleeve
the
driver
was
directed
to
stop
at
the
bank
tiplady
went
in
and
came
out
with
a
serious
face
will
they
not
answer
you
cried
lady
cleeve
oh
yes
they
made
no
difficulty
about
that
well
how
much
has
he
drawn
out
nearly
every
pound
he
had
there
so
poor
lady
cleeve
had
to
go
home
with
her
anxiety
augmented
instead
of
lessened
suppose
philip
in
his
dismay
at
the
loss
of
all
his
money
should
should
have
done
something
rash
saturday
wore
itself
away
the
look
on
the
mother
face
was
pitiful
to
see
she
sat
at
the
window
which
faced
the
looking
for
one
that
did
not
appear
and
when
dusk
had
closed
in
she
still
sat
on
in
the
same
spot
listening
in
the
dark
with
straining
eyes
for
the
footfall
that
was
so
long
in
coming
sunday
morning
came
and
with
it
the
postman
for
there
was
an
early
postal
delivery
on
that
day
at
nullington
but
there
was
no
letter
from
philip
spreckley
was
in
the
act
of
brushing
his
hat
preparatory
to
setting
out
for
church
when
in
rushed
bridget
her
lady
had
suddenly
been
taken
with
one
of
her
old
attacks
and
the
doctor
must
hasten
to
her
spreckley
had
another
patient
on
his
hands
at
that
time
the
reverend
francis
kettle
he
was
laid
up
with
gout
when
spreckley
called
there
after
church
he
mentioned
lady
cleeve
illness
to
maria
she
had
been
getting
on
so
well
lately
he
lamented
anxiety
of
mind
has
brought
on
this
attack
nothing
else
anxiety
of
mind
repeated
maria
yes
all
about
that
son
of
hers
he
went
to
london
on
wednesday
last
and
has
never
been
heard
of
since
she
is
in
a
fine
quandary
i
can
tell
you
fancying
some
dreadful
harm
has
come
to
him
but
why
should
harm
come
to
him
asked
maria
her
heart
beating
wildly
why
indeed
he
does
harm
enough
to
himself
without
its
coming
to
him
gratuitously
been
and
spent
all
his
money
made
ducks
and
drakes
of
it
oh
gasped
maria
how
returned
the
doctor
well
looking
at
maria
countenance
been
embarking
a
lot
of
it
in
some
precious
mining
scheme
and
the
mine
has
burst
up
maria
went
to
lady
cleeve
that
afternoon
she
found
her
very
maria
hid
her
own
fears
and
forebodings
and
spoke
cheerfully
and
hopefully
although
every
now
and
then
a
blinding
rush
of
tears
would
come
into
her
eyes
when
she
thought
that
perhaps
in
very
truth
she
should
never
see
philip
more
on
this
side
the
grave
more
than
ever
before
she
seemed
to
realise
how
dear
he
was
to
her
heart
how
many
days
of
this
terrible
anxiety
went
on
neither
of
them
cared
to
number
the
vicar
was
getting
better
now
though
still
confined
to
a
sofa
in
his
room
and
maria
spent
much
of
her
time
at
homedale
one
morning
there
arrived
a
telegram
addressed
to
lady
cleeve
the
poor
mother
face
turned
paler
still
and
her
hands
trembled
so
much
that
she
could
not
open
it
she
signed
to
maria
to
take
the
paper
no
maxwell
terrace
wandsworth
london
phillip
cleeve
i
have
met
with
a
slight
accident
which
will
detain
me
in
london
for
a
few
days
yet
it
is
nothing
serious
so
do
not
be
alarmed
another
message
thank
heaven
my
boy
still
lives
said
lady
cleeve
tears
of
thankfulness
stood
in
maria
eyes
for
she
also
had
been
fearing
the
worst
and
yet
it
is
strange
why
he
has
not
written
mused
lady
cleeve
stretching
out
her
hand
for
the
paper
he
says
message
why
send
a
telegram
when
if
he
were
to
post
a
letter
this
evening
it
would
reach
me
in
the
morning
he
must
be
worse
than
he
wishes
me
to
know
of
he
must
be
so
ill
that
he
can
not
write
he
may
be
dying
and
i
can
not
go
to
him
i
will
go
to
him
dear
lady
cleeve
said
maria
with
a
lovely
flush
on
her
cheeks
you
my
dear
yes
i
can
go
papa
is
almost
well
now
but
my
dear
child
will
it
do
for
to
go
you
i
am
his
promised
wife
and
who
has
more
right
to
be
by
his
side
at
such
a
time
as
this
than
i
have
she
flung
herself
into
lady
cleeve
arms
and
the
two
wept
together
maria
lost
no
time
before
the
astonished
vicar
could
say
yes
or
no
before
he
quite
understood
what
the
matter
was
she
was
on
her
way
to
the
a
cab
stopped
that
same
evening
at
the
door
of
no
maxwell
terrace
miss
kettle
alighted
knocked
and
inquired
for
cleeve
before
the
servant
had
time
to
reply
a
gentleman
came
out
of
a
come
inside
come
inside
he
said
as
he
peered
at
maria
through
his
spectacles
yes
cleeve
is
under
this
roof
he
is
my
guest
you
know
and
you
i
presume
are
some
relation
of
his
he
added
as
he
led
the
way
into
the
parlour
perhaps
his
sister
no
not
his
sister
faltered
maria
the
difficulties
of
her
position
suddenly
presenting
themselves
to
her
i
am
not
related
to
him
not
related
to
him
repeated
the
old
gentleman
gazing
at
her
but
there
was
something
so
benevolent
in
the
ruddy
face
so
kindly
in
the
honest
eyes
that
maria
took
heart
and
courage
i
am
his
promised
wife
sir
she
said
simply
there
was
nobody
but
me
to
come
his
promised
wife
now
bless
my
heart
but
that
very
nice
do
you
know
i
never
had
a
promised
wife
i
often
wish
that
i
had
my
marjoram
my
dear
josiah
marjoram
late
of
bucklersbury
city
now
retired
with
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
do
it
hard
work
though
sometimes
but
about
philip
about
cleeve
sir
said
maria
earnestly
is
he
very
ill
i
was
to
send
a
telegram
to
his
mother
if
i
got
here
in
time
how
was
he
hurt
sit
down
my
dear
and
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
it
was
as
gallant
a
thing
as
ever
i
saw
i
was
standing
at
my
window
one
afternoon
whistling
to
myself
and
thinking
about
nothing
in
particular
when
all
at
once
a
hansom
cab
came
dashing
round
the
corner
at
a
most
furious
rate
a
little
child
was
running
across
the
road
it
stumbled
and
fell
upon
which
a
young
man
who
happened
to
be
passing
and
whom
i
had
not
noticed
before
dashed
into
the
road
and
seized
the
child
in
his
arms
but
he
was
too
late
the
cab
was
over
him
the
child
escaped
with
a
few
bruises
but
the
young
man
was
well
let
us
put
it
rather
badly
hurt
him
to
the
hospital
called
out
the
people
running
up
only
hospital
he
shall
go
to
is
my
house
i
said
to
them
and
into
it
he
was
carried
we
found
a
name
on
some
cards
in
his
cleeve
but
no
address
so
that
i
was
unable
to
communicate
with
his
friends
and
he
was
too
much
injured
to
give
you
the
address
exclaimed
maria
just
so
he
was
not
sufficiently
sensible
but
he
is
getting
better
now
oh
very
much
better
added
the
old
gentleman
briskly
as
a
proof
of
it
it
was
he
who
dictated
the
telegram
to
lady
cleeve
this
morning
my
doctor
and
the
one
from
london
both
say
that
with
care
we
shall
soon
have
him
on
his
legs
again
now
i
should
like
to
see
him
sir
if
you
please
said
maria
faintly
so
you
shall
my
dear
so
you
shall
when
i
have
spoken
to
the
nurse
meanwhile
my
housekeeper
wale
a
good
motherly
old
soul
shall
show
you
to
your
room
to
take
your
bonnet
off
we
prepared
it
for
his
mother
thinking
she
might
come
the
old
housekeeper
came
in
curtseying
she
supposed
maria
to
be
lady
cleeve
daughter
maria
took
off
her
travelling
things
and
was
then
ready
to
see
philip
marjoram
opened
the
for
her
she
caught
sight
of
a
white
face
on
the
pillow
and
two
preternaturally
large
eyes
that
stared
at
her
as
if
she
were
a
visitor
from
the
dead
she
bent
her
face
to
his
oh
my
dear
one
she
murmured
thank
heaven
i
have
found
you
at
last
and
maria
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
leave
him
again
the
doctors
said
that
very
much
would
depend
on
good
nursing
maria
felt
that
no
one
could
nurse
him
as
she
could
at
least
she
would
help
to
do
it
the
old
gentleman
approved
of
this
so
much
that
he
clapped
his
hands
in
applause
he
told
maria
he
wished
she
could
be
converted
by
some
good
fairy
into
his
real
daughter
and
never
go
away
from
his
house
on
the
morning
after
philip
first
wretched
night
in
london
when
he
was
somewhat
restored
to
common
sense
he
resolved
to
return
to
nullington
and
confess
all
his
weakness
and
folly
to
his
mother
and
to
tiplady
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
the
thought
struck
him
that
he
ought
once
more
to
go
to
the
hermandad
office
in
the
city
and
to
ascertain
if
possible
whether
the
prospect
was
absolutely
hopeless
the
place
was
still
shut
up
and
philip
could
hear
nothing
in
coming
away
he
met
a
gentleman
whom
he
had
seen
at
the
lilacs
an
acquaintance
of
captain
lennox
and
ducie
this
gentleman
had
also
put
some
money
into
the
mine
and
had
come
down
to
the
city
on
the
same
errand
as
philip
lennox
no
i
ca
tell
you
where
he
is
i
not
seen
him
here
lately
he
said
in
answer
to
philip
question
lennox
is
as
hard
hit
as
we
are
i
expect
worse
in
fact
he
may
be
staying
with
those
friends
he
has
at
wandsworth
he
is
there
sometimes
can
you
give
me
their
address
why
yes
i
can
i
spent
an
evening
or
two
there
with
lennox
in
the
summer
philip
took
the
address
and
went
to
wandsworth
he
found
the
people
but
could
not
hear
anything
of
captain
lennox
they
supposed
him
to
be
at
nullington
it
was
after
leaving
their
house
that
philip
met
with
the
accident
it
is
probable
that
his
previous
night
vigil
and
the
troubled
state
his
mind
was
in
rendered
him
less
quick
and
agile
than
he
might
otherwise
have
been
when
philip
had
gained
sufficient
strength
he
poured
into
maria
kettle
ear
all
the
story
of
his
folly
and
ruin
the
latter
culminating
with
these
dreadful
mines
he
was
yet
so
weak
and
ill
that
when
he
had
done
he
cried
like
a
child
maria
pressed
his
hand
to
her
soft
warm
cheek
and
soothed
and
comforted
him
i
think
sometimes
maria
that
if
you
had
not
cast
me
off
as
you
did
all
this
would
not
have
happened
he
continued
and
yet
how
weak
and
foolish
i
have
been
all
through
no
one
knows
better
than
myself
i
will
never
leave
you
again
she
murmured
with
scarlet
cheeks
and
they
sealed
the
promise
with
a
kiss
i
shall
always
say
maria
your
father
was
harder
to
me
than
he
need
have
been
yes
but
the
truth
is
philip
he
has
had
more
on
his
mind
than
he
would
speak
of
she
returned
it
was
about
about
what
queried
philip
as
she
stopped
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
mention
it
i
shall
never
rest
now
till
you
have
told
me
papa
took
up
a
notion
that
you
were
somehow
concerned
in
those
robberies
which
took
place
his
own
purse
you
know
and
the
and
the
jewels
philip
large
eyes
grew
larger
as
he
stared
at
maria
not
that
i
stole
them
you
ca
mean
that
i
fear
that
he
was
afraid
you
did
downes
was
also
philip
lay
without
speaking
lost
in
astonishment
presently
he
burst
into
the
strongest
laugh
his
feeble
state
allowed
what
a
joke
maria
they
could
not
believe
such
a
thing
of
me
i
am
philip
cleeve
the
words
imparted
their
own
assurance
though
maria
had
never
needed
to
be
assured
did
think
this
oh
philip
do
you
know
me
better
than
that
my
dear
yes
forgive
the
question
you
say
you
will
never
leave
me
again
maria
i
bless
you
for
that
if
we
could
but
be
married
here
and
now
so
that
no
adverse
fate
might
ever
more
part
us
here
and
now
maria
vivid
blush
was
the
only
answer
but
how
could
we
live
now
that
our
future
is
marred
continued
philip
as
tiplady
partner
i
could
have
ensured
you
a
good
home
but
the
money
which
was
to
have
secured
that
position
the
twelve
hundred
pounds
is
gone
for
ever
i
have
two
thousand
pounds
that
i
think
you
have
not
heard
of
philip
she
said
in
a
low
tone
as
she
hid
her
face
mrs
page
left
it
to
me
we
will
pay
over
some
of
it
to
tiplady
in
place
of
that
which
is
lost
maria
yes
she
answered
i
have
been
intending
it
ever
since
i
knew
you
were
getting
better
do
not
fret
after
the
money
philip
captain
lennox
is
worse
off
hang
captain
lennox
interjected
philip
but
for
him
i
should
never
have
got
into
trouble
of
any
kind
he
had
embarked
it
is
said
a
great
deal
in
this
mine
added
maria
people
fancy
that
it
is
his
loss
in
it
which
makes
him
think
of
giving
up
the
lilacs
romantic
though
old
marjoram
showed
himself
to
be
it
yet
may
have
surprised
him
to
be
told
that
the
two
young
people
enjoying
his
hospitality
had
determined
to
get
married
as
soon
as
possible
while
philip
still
lay
ill
and
helpless
if
he
the
kind
old
gentleman
would
only
help
them
to
accomplish
it
oh
ho
said
he
love
young
dream
and
all
that
eh
your
parents
have
destined
you
for
one
another
from
childhood
you
tell
me
that
quite
true
said
philip
from
his
pillow
philip
will
need
careful
tending
for
some
time
to
come
as
you
know
sir
spoke
maria
with
soft
red
cheeks
and
downcast
eyes
and
no
one
can
tend
him
as
a
wife
can
if
you
sir
would
be
at
the
trouble
of
procuring
a
special
license
for
us
and
and
philip
and
i
thought
if
you
would
not
mind
our
being
married
here
quietly
some
morning
tears
twinkled
on
the
old
gentleman
eyelashes
he
drew
maria
to
him
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
and
she
cried
a
little
on
his
shoulder
as
she
might
have
done
on
that
of
her
father
marjoram
wished
that
heaven
had
given
him
such
a
child
thus
it
fell
out
that
a
few
days
later
a
quiet
wedding
took
place
in
the
of
no
maxwell
terrace
philip
was
lifted
out
of
bed
that
day
for
the
first
time
since
his
accident
and
lay
on
a
couch
while
the
ceremony
was
performed
he
looked
desperately
white
and
ill
poor
fellow
but
the
light
of
perfect
content
shone
in
his
eyes
and
the
old
sweet
smile
that
used
to
mark
the
philip
cleeve
of
old
days
came
and
went
continually
on
his
lips
marjoram
gave
away
the
bride
and
his
sister
a
charming
maiden
lady
of
fifty
came
all
the
way
from
hertford
to
countenance
the
ceremony
and
the
old
state
of
things
then
went
on
again
poor
helpless
philip
lay
in
bed
and
maria
waited
on
him
but
he
seemed
to
get
rapidly
better
now
and
when
sufficiently
well
to
leave
the
good
old
man
hospitable
roof
he
and
maria
went
to
a
quiet
seaside
place
lying
on
their
way
to
norfolk
that
philip
might
inhale
the
refreshing
for
a
few
days
before
returning
home
at
present
he
and
his
wife
would
stay
with
lady
cleeve
she
lady
cleeve
was
thankful
in
her
heart
for
all
that
had
happened
now
that
it
had
led
to
all
this
happiness
the
vicar
making
up
his
mind
at
first
to
be
very
stern
and
high
and
mighty
broke
down
at
the
first
interview
for
one
thing
his
mind
was
at
rest
as
to
fancied
participation
in
the
robberies
too
much
proof
had
been
found
at
the
lilacs
by
detective
meath
to
admit
of
suspicion
against
anyone
but
captain
lennox
downes
had
turned
up
first
it
was
supposed
the
captain
had
been
afraid
to
get
rid
of
it
for
a
time
most
of
the
jewels
lost
at
heron
dyke
had
been
found
there
and
the
fellow
of
malachite
and
gold
that
we
must
have
a
amongst
us
here
i
knew
cried
downes
but
i
never
suspected
lennox
i
was
more
inclined
to
suspect
master
philip
with
a
nod
at
philip
who
was
lying
on
a
sofa
although
you
are
your
father
son
and
your
good
mother
you
are
laughing
are
you
well
you
can
afford
to
laugh
things
having
turned
out
so
you
have
found
it
no
laughing
matter
had
you
been
the
black
sheep
i
dare
say
not
doctor
answered
philip
but
it
is
an
awful
thought
that
he
lennox
whose
hand
has
been
meeting
ours
in
friendship
should
have
been
the
murderer
of
hubert
stone
chapter
ix
in
the
dusk
of
evening
never
had
the
good
people
of
nullington
had
more
food
for
gossip
wonder
and
surmise
never
had
they
been
so
startled
out
of
the
ordinary
quietude
of
their
lives
as
during
the
christmastide
to
which
events
have
now
brought
us
the
marriage
under
somewhat
romantic
circumstances
of
philip
cleeve
and
the
coming
home
of
himself
and
his
bride
would
in
ordinary
times
have
served
as
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
for
a
month
to
come
but
this
comparatively
tame
episode
was
completely
overshadowed
by
the
startling
revelations
in
connection
with
captain
lennox
both
captain
lennox
and
his
sister
had
vanished
as
completely
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
them
up
they
had
been
traced
to
london
but
there
the
trail
was
lost
and
it
had
not
hitherto
been
found
again
lennox
had
never
come
back
to
complete
the
arrangements
respecting
the
letting
of
the
cottage
to
norris
something
must
have
aroused
his
suspicions
and
some
one
probably
one
of
his
own
servants
must
have
sent
him
timely
information
respecting
the
execution
of
the
in
any
case
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
after
that
day
meath
was
at
fault
the
general
police
were
at
fault
and
meanwhile
the
cottage
remained
in
charge
of
the
police
local
constabulary
christmas
at
heron
dyke
could
not
well
have
been
spent
more
quietly
conroy
was
away
for
a
few
days
about
this
time
carlyon
and
ella
went
into
the
town
occasionally
to
see
maria
and
philip
and
that
was
about
their
only
dissipation
it
must
have
been
captain
lennox
who
took
the
out
of
my
that
night
at
bayswater
remarked
carlyon
one
day
and
to
think
i
could
not
get
rid
of
an
uneasy
suspicion
that
it
might
have
been
poor
philip
cleeve
who
had
taken
it
ella
looked
up
in
surprise
philip
cleeve
she
exclaimed
well
yes
i
am
ashamed
to
say
so
ella
but
what
could
possibly
have
led
you
to
such
a
suspicion
as
that
aunt
gertrude
captain
lennox
led
me
otherwise
i
should
no
more
have
thought
of
philip
in
the
matter
than
i
should
have
thought
of
you
ella
felt
bewildered
surely
captain
lennox
did
not
dare
to
accuse
philip
oh
dear
no
one
day
a
few
weeks
after
the
loss
when
captain
lennox
was
in
town
and
calling
upon
me
he
inquired
whether
the
jewels
had
been
found
in
talking
of
the
affair
he
dropped
a
word
it
was
little
more
than
one
which
somehow
turned
my
thoughts
to
philip
the
captain
caught
it
up
again
as
if
he
had
let
it
drop
inadvertently
and
i
did
not
pursue
it
since
then
when
i
have
heard
at
times
how
fast
philip
was
supposed
to
be
spending
money
at
cards
billiards
and
such
like
that
inadvertent
word
has
returned
to
my
mind
doubtfully
and
most
disagreeably
do
you
suppose
captain
lennox
wished
you
to
think
he
accused
philip
no
replied
carlyon
i
think
he
wanted
to
instil
a
slight
doubt
of
his
possible
guilt
into
my
mind
so
as
to
more
completely
throw
any
possible
suspicion
off
himself
that
is
how
i
fancy
it
must
have
been
aunt
gertrude
said
ella
musingly
i
wonder
whether
it
was
captain
lennox
who
stole
freddy
bootle
watch
and
chain
that
same
night
and
then
made
out
that
his
own
purse
was
likewise
stolen
little
need
to
wonder
nothing
was
ever
much
more
sure
than
that
said
carlyon
the
man
must
have
lived
by
these
peculations
and
to
think
what
a
gentleman
he
was
through
it
all
conroy
came
back
and
whatever
minor
elements
of
disquietude
might
make
themselves
felt
now
and
again
there
was
a
certain
sweet
fulness
of
content
about
ella
life
just
now
that
nothing
could
seriously
affect
she
had
won
the
sweetest
guerdon
a
woman
can
win
and
all
things
else
whether
pleasing
or
displeasing
seemed
dwarfed
in
comparison
with
that
one
supreme
fact
the
more
she
saw
of
conroy
the
more
she
seemed
to
find
in
him
to
love
and
appreciate
day
by
day
the
choice
she
had
made
approved
itself
more
fully
to
her
heart
even
carlyon
now
that
she
was
domesticated
daily
with
conroy
no
longer
wondered
at
what
she
called
ella
infatuation
it
had
been
arranged
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
early
in
spring
ella
wished
to
delay
the
event
until
the
doubt
as
to
the
date
of
her
uncle
death
and
her
own
rightful
inheritance
of
the
property
should
be
cleared
up
but
conroy
urged
that
that
was
no
good
cause
for
delay
suppose
she
said
to
him
one
day
that
after
we
are
married
it
should
be
discovered
that
i
am
not
the
true
heiress
and
heron
dyke
goes
from
me
what
then
he
answered
we
should
still
have
enough
for
comfort
you
possess
some
income
that
is
indisputably
your
own
and
i
dare
say
i
could
match
it
in
one
way
or
another
by
your
newspaper
work
by
that
or
other
things
i
have
given
up
the
newspapers
for
the
present
am
not
sure
that
i
shall
take
to
them
again
be
at
rest
my
dear
and
trust
to
me
we
shall
be
able
to
keep
up
a
modest
home
and
a
cow
and
a
what
more
can
we
want
you
are
laughing
at
me
edward
no
indeed
i
only
wish
you
not
to
be
troubled
about
this
property
it
may
be
yours
or
it
may
not
be
i
fancy
you
think
it
is
not
mine
i
fancy
that
if
everybody
possessed
their
legal
rights
it
would
turn
out
to
be
at
this
moment
denison
but
we
have
yet
no
proof
of
that
and
it
may
be
that
i
am
mistaken
the
shortest
way
would
be
to
give
it
up
to
him
at
once
my
dear
denison
would
not
take
it
he
is
one
of
the
last
men
in
the
world
to
do
so
do
you
know
mr
denison
i
have
seen
him
i
know
that
he
is
a
straightforward
honourable
man
ella
she
wished
the
doubt
could
be
solved
conroy
wished
the
same
though
perhaps
in
a
less
ardent
way
it
did
not
him
as
it
did
her
he
was
more
patient
more
reconciled
to
let
time
work
out
its
own
ends
he
held
a
secret
conviction
that
aaron
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
plot
if
there
had
been
a
plot
but
conroy
kept
that
impression
to
himself
harsh
crabbed
and
unsympathetic
as
was
aaron
stone
both
by
nature
and
training
the
shock
of
his
grandson
sudden
death
following
so
soon
after
that
of
the
squire
had
not
failed
to
leave
its
traces
behind
in
a
few
short
months
aaron
seemed
to
have
grown
a
dozen
years
older
his
hair
was
thinner
and
whiter
he
had
become
more
feeble
in
his
gait
and
he
claimed
the
assistance
of
a
stick
in
walking
more
frequently
than
before
he
maundered
in
an
undertone
to
himself
as
he
walked
about
the
hall
with
his
keys
his
chief
duty
now
was
to
shut
up
the
old
house
at
night
and
to
open
it
in
the
morning
he
did
little
else
and
he
would
often
speak
out
aloud
as
in
answer
to
some
question
when
nobody
had
asked
him
one
he
would
have
liked
to
follow
his
mistress
about
much
as
a
faithful
old
mastiff
might
have
done
gazing
from
the
doors
when
she
was
in
the
grounds
moving
restlessly
about
her
chair
at
dinner
to
conroy
he
had
taken
umbrage
and
would
mutter
to
himself
that
a
strange
man
had
no
business
at
heron
dyke
the
best
of
were
but
spies
what
do
he
do
up
in
that
north
wing
so
much
soliloquised
the
old
man
in
the
homely
speech
he
was
pleased
to
indulge
in
when
off
duty
i
see
him
evening
after
evening
softly
up
and
down
again
what
do
he
do
it
for
what
he
looking
after
do
the
young
mistress
know
of
it
i
wonder
who
can
answer
that
he
war
in
that
theft
o
the
jewels
yah
spies
of
all
the
inmates
of
the
hall
the
one
least
tolerant
of
his
crotchets
and
his
failings
was
carlyon
on
occasion
she
spoke
of
them
to
ella
it
is
partly
your
fault
child
you
give
in
to
him
so
i
do
think
i
do
aunt
in
what
way
do
i
in
many
ways
look
at
that
senseless
fancy
he
has
taken
up
of
having
no
in
the
house
but
himself
and
you
fall
in
with
it
we
have
enough
maids
for
the
work
aunt
gertrude
i
am
aware
of
that
i
suppose
we
have
not
much
less
than
here
including
your
maid
and
mine
that
is
not
the
question
in
your
position
mistress
of
this
grand
old
place
it
behoves
you
to
keep
as
other
people
do
but
because
aaron
sets
his
face
against
it
you
it
is
not
that
aunt
interrupted
ella
what
i
thought
right
to
do
i
should
do
in
spite
of
aaron
believe
that
it
is
the
uncertainty
in
which
things
are
that
causes
me
to
live
quietly
once
i
hear
if
i
ever
do
that
i
am
the
rightful
owner
of
heron
dyke
you
will
find
me
make
all
changes
that
are
suitable
carlyon
said
no
more
then
she
heartily
wished
her
sojourn
at
heron
dyke
was
at
an
end
that
she
might
return
to
her
own
more
comfortable
home
for
in
her
opinion
the
atmosphere
of
the
hall
was
not
comfortable
of
that
dark
north
wing
she
had
a
wholesome
dread
as
well
as
of
the
lost
girl
spirit
which
was
supposed
to
haunt
it
to
her
niece
she
did
not
speak
of
this
but
she
and
toynbee
who
was
very
poorly
at
this
time
and
kept
much
to
her
own
chamber
talked
confidentially
together
and
agreed
that
matters
altogether
were
more
doubtful
than
they
ought
to
be
this
is
a
queer
thing
miss
ella
that
folks
down
at
nullington
are
whispering
to
one
another
exclaimed
aaron
overtaking
his
mistress
one
afternoon
in
the
new
conservatory
what
is
it
that
they
are
whispering
she
turned
to
ask
about
that
captain
lennox
if
was
him
that
robbed
the
hall
then
he
must
have
been
the
villain
who
destroyed
my
poor
boy
ah
but
it
a
terrible
world
i
fear
some
of
us
find
it
so
aaron
to
think
of
it
captain
lennox
but
i
never
liked
him
i
never
liked
that
sharp
foxy
face
of
his
ella
mentally
wondered
whom
the
old
man
had
liked
i
mistrusted
him
miss
ella
from
the
first
time
i
saw
him
when
a
man
talks
to
you
so
soft
and
as
the
captain
did
and
at
the
same
time
fixes
you
with
such
a
pair
of
cruel
eyes
it
is
best
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
i
set
such
a
man
down
as
dangerous
miss
winter
had
herself
always
felt
a
secret
distrust
of
lennox
without
knowing
the
reason
why
perhaps
as
aaron
had
said
it
was
the
contrast
between
his
smooth
dulcet
tones
and
the
expression
in
his
cold
glances
any
way
she
had
never
taken
cordially
to
captain
lennox
your
wife
seems
but
poorly
aaron
resumed
miss
winter
purposely
quitting
the
other
subject
she
a
bigger
ninny
than
ever
retorted
aaron
in
an
explosive
tone
i
beg
pardon
but
the
old
woman
be
enough
to
wear
patience
out
dorothy
stone
seemed
to
live
in
a
chronic
state
of
fear
what
was
it
that
she
was
afraid
of
her
husband
would
angrily
ask
her
and
the
most
he
could
make
of
her
trembling
answers
was
that
she
was
afraid
of
the
ghosts
heron
dyke
had
become
a
fearsome
place
she
would
say
any
night
she
might
meet
katherine
keen
in
the
passages
or
maybe
the
dead
squire
aaron
quite
beside
himself
with
wrath
at
all
this
threatened
to
shake
her
but
the
threat
made
no
visible
impression
miss
winter
would
reason
with
her
now
and
again
but
the
old
woman
life
had
become
a
trouble
to
herself
what
little
pleasure
a
sadly
negative
one
she
ever
found
in
it
was
when
she
recalled
all
her
grandson
perfections
and
her
past
love
for
him
to
this
she
found
sympathising
listeners
in
the
maids
where
was
there
another
like
him
she
would
say
from
the
before
the
fire
in
her
own
a
huge
black
bow
on
her
muslin
cap
so
bold
and
handsome
and
he
was
fit
to
match
with
any
gentleman
in
the
land
and
so
he
was
would
make
answer
to
her
phemie
or
eliza
when
was
that
vision
of
the
hearse
and
headless
horses
ever
known
to
show
its
warning
for
the
likes
of
you
and
me
she
would
continue
but
it
appeared
for
for
it
was
generally
believed
that
not
often
was
that
dire
portent
visible
to
mortal
eye
except
when
the
scion
of
some
great
family
was
about
to
be
summoned
hence
thus
as
dorothy
looked
upon
it
the
vision
must
be
regarded
as
a
species
of
honour
it
was
for
macbeth
alone
that
the
witches
worked
their
spells
and
brewed
their
potions
their
business
lay
not
with
the
rabble
rout
that
called
him
captain
but
there
came
an
hour
when
pondering
upon
these
matters
it
occurred
to
edward
conroy
a
shrewd
reasoner
that
more
might
be
in
this
nervous
terror
of
dorothy
than
she
allowed
to
meet
the
eye
was
it
that
she
was
afraid
of
he
asked
himself
the
question
sitting
by
the
blazing
fire
in
her
own
parlour
or
in
the
kitchen
bright
with
sunlight
people
around
her
within
beck
and
call
it
could
not
be
that
she
feared
to
see
a
ghost
there
that
poor
katherine
keen
in
the
spirit
would
walk
in
to
confront
her
yet
that
dorothy
would
and
did
sit
there
often
in
the
in
unmistakable
terror
could
not
be
disputed
how
much
does
dorothy
know
about
the
circumstances
of
your
death
conroy
took
an
opportunity
of
inquiring
of
ella
indeed
i
can
not
tell
replied
ella
i
have
not
liked
to
question
her
i
dare
say
she
knows
no
more
than
we
know
um
that
as
it
may
be
she
was
during
all
the
time
oh
yes
she
was
here
rather
a
queer
notion
that
of
hers
which
i
hear
she
has
taken
up
continued
conroy
after
a
long
pause
that
she
may
meet
the
ghost
if
she
goes
near
his
old
rooms
at
night
dorothy
was
always
so
silly
in
that
way
you
have
some
motive
edward
in
saying
this
yes
i
have
been
watching
dorothy
waylaying
her
when
she
steals
out
to
that
little
patch
of
herbs
which
she
calls
her
own
garden
and
turning
in
at
other
times
to
her
ostensibly
to
hold
with
her
a
bit
of
chat
and
she
gives
me
the
impression
of
a
woman
who
has
something
on
her
mind
something
that
will
not
allow
her
to
rest
she
has
her
superstitious
fancies
i
do
mean
her
fancies
it
is
a
more
tangible
fear
unless
i
am
mistaken
a
few
days
ago
i
found
her
crying
and
trembling
said
miss
winter
she
told
me
she
had
dozed
off
in
her
chair
over
her
work
and
had
had
a
dream
which
frightened
her
did
she
tell
you
what
the
dream
was
about
no
except
that
she
thought
she
saw
my
uncle
in
it
ah
it
strikes
me
he
is
on
her
mind
too
much
i
wish
ella
you
would
put
a
few
questions
to
her
about
the
squire
and
let
me
be
present
not
questions
to
alarm
her
i
suppose
my
dear
if
she
knows
of
nothing
wrong
in
connection
with
that
time
how
could
they
alarm
her
true
i
will
ask
her
morning
she
shall
come
in
to
take
my
orders
instead
of
my
going
to
her
the
next
morning
dorothy
full
of
her
cares
for
dinner
for
she
was
still
the
housekeeper
and
bustling
enough
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
was
summoned
to
miss
winter
presence
conroy
had
come
to
the
hall
betimes
that
day
and
sat
at
the
back
of
the
room
reading
a
newspaper
ella
quietly
gave
her
orders
and
dorothy
received
them
intelligently
as
usual
in
her
own
department
as
housekeeper
the
woman
was
capable
yet
is
that
all
miss
ella
she
asked
all
for
the
present
i
think
of
having
a
few
friends
to
dinner
soon
philip
cleeve
and
his
wife
and
the
vicar
and
lady
cleeve
if
she
is
able
to
come
just
or
so
besides
ourselves
but
i
will
talk
to
you
of
that
yes
assented
dorothy
about
to
move
away
wait
a
moment
said
her
mistress
i
wish
to
ask
you
a
question
or
two
dorothy
about
that
dexter
the
woman
who
nursed
my
uncle
as
i
hear
during
his
last
illness
i
wish
to
see
dexter
can
you
tell
me
where
to
find
her
dorothy
hands
began
to
tremble
as
though
she
had
been
suddenly
smitten
with
ague
she
threw
a
look
at
her
mistress
so
frightened
and
imploring
that
the
latter
almost
regretted
she
had
spoken
and
then
she
glanced
beyond
her
at
conroy
but
he
seemed
to
see
nothing
but
his
newspaper
do
you
know
where
i
could
find
mrs
dexter
repeated
miss
winter
i
do
know
anything
about
dexter
dorothy
whispered
forth
in
a
twittering
voice
nor
do
i
ever
wish
to
know
you
did
not
like
her
then
dorothy
i
did
not
like
her
miss
winter
rose
sit
down
dorothy
she
said
kindly
you
need
not
be
put
out
there
sit
in
that
chair
and
now
tell
me
why
you
did
not
like
mrs
dexter
the
trembling
woman
wiped
her
lips
i
ca
tell
why
i
did
and
that
all
i
know
when
she
first
come
here
with
jago
i
was
finely
put
out
hurt
if
one
may
put
it
so
my
nursing
had
been
good
enough
for
my
master
up
to
then
and
i
thought
it
might
have
been
good
enough
still
i
told
the
doctor
my
mind
dorothy
continued
miss
winter
after
a
pause
of
thought
i
have
never
questioned
you
about
my
uncle
death
the
subject
was
a
painful
one
and
i
was
more
deeply
grieved
than
i
can
express
that
i
was
not
allowed
to
be
here
at
the
time
did
you
see
him
up
to
the
day
of
his
death
no
gasped
dorothy
when
did
you
see
him
last
how
long
before
he
died
again
that
same
imploring
look
but
no
answer
you
must
tell
me
dorothy
not
for
weeks
and
weeks
spoke
the
woman
then
but
with
evident
reluctance
that
was
strange
was
it
not
considering
that
you
were
always
so
great
a
favourite
with
uncle
gilbert
dorothy
lifted
the
corner
of
her
clean
white
linen
apron
and
wiped
her
face
with
trembling
fingers
she
seemed
to
gather
a
little
courage
when
he
had
that
dexter
he
did
want
me
i
take
it
she
was
the
nurse
and
she
did
let
anybody
go
near
the
master
she
kept
him
shut
up
behind
the
green
baize
doors
and
would
not
let
him
be
seen
by
anyone
that
is
what
you
mean
that
was
just
it
assented
dorothy

eagerly
but
they
let
you
see
him
after
he
was
dead
you
who
had
been
his
faithful
servant
for
so
many
years
surely
they
let
you
look
for
the
last
time
on
that
dear
face
so
soon
to
be
hidden
for
ever
not
even
then
did
they
let
me
see
him
she
cried
no
not
even
then
it
was
cruel
cruel
cruel
indeed
i
did
not
think
aaron
could
have
been
so
unkind
to
you
he
had
one
of
the
keys
of
the
green
doors
and
could
have
let
you
through
at
any
time
dorothy
sighed
and
let
fall
her
apron
all
this
was
beginning
to
frighten
her
miss
winter
advanced
and
stood
in
front
of
her
there
was
nothing
going
on
behind
those
green
baize
doors
was
there
dorothy
she
asked
in
expressive
tones
her
eyes
gazing
straight
into
the
woman
nothing
that
they
wanted
to
keep
from
you
and
from
everyone
dorothy
flung
up
her
arms
with
a
sudden
gesture
of
dismay
oh
mistress
ask
me
no
more
for
heaven
sake
she
cried
i
know
nothing
i
have
nothing
to
tell
repeated
miss
winter
no
nothing
and
the
poor
shaking
woman
looked
so
distressed
as
she
crept
to
the
door
that
miss
winter
let
her
escape
ella
cried
her
lover
quietly
rising
from
behind
his
newspaper
it
is
from
that
woman
we
must
get
the
clue
she
knows
more
than
she
dares
to
tell
i
am
right
it
is
this
trouble
that
is
preying
upon
her
mind
certainly
her
manner
is
suggestive
assented
ella
but
look
at
her
distress
how
shall
we
get
anything
more
from
her
that
is
just
the
point
we
have
to
consider
said
conroy
of
one
thing
i
am
persuaded
that
she
would
never
tell
me
what
is
not
true
under
ordinary
circumstances
no
i
believe
that
but
she
may
be
forced
into
it
by
aaron
and
the
rest
of
the
conspirators
oh
edward
conspirators
poor
old
aaron
well
my
dear
time
will
show
if
that
old
man
has
not
a
weighty
secret
on
his
back
tell
me
that
my
name
is
not
conroy
for
a
few
days
after
this
things
went
on
at
the
hall
in
their
usual
state
of
quiet
monotony
perhaps
we
might
say
could
the
minds
of
some
of
its
inmates
have
been
read
old
dorothy
went
about
her
duties
in
a
dazed
manner
but
nothing
more
was
said
to
her
gradually
finding
herself
let
alone
the
scare
which
seemed
to
have
taken
up
its
abode
permanently
on
her
face
began
to
leave
it
the
young
mistress
must
see
that
i
can
tell
nothing
she
told
herself
and
she
wo
frighten
me
again
by
asking
me
to
why
should
innocent
folks
suffer
for
the
guilty
if
that
dexter
woman
and
that
horrid
jago
had
but
never
come
anigh
this
miserable
house
late
one
afternoon
when
the
sun
had
set
and
the
dusk
of
the
january
evening
was
drawing
on
there
was
heard
a
soft
knock
at
the
outer
door
which
opened
from
the
kitchen
corridor
into
the
shrubbery
at
the
back
of
the
hall
dorothy
was
in
her
own
room
adjoining
the
kitchen
the
door
between
them
standing
partly
open
she
had
put
down
the
grey
stocking
of
her
husband
which
she
had
been
mending
and
sat
in
the
firelight
doing
nothing
save
idly
watching
phemie
who
was
preparing
her
tea
in
the
kitchen
and
wondering
whether
aaron
would
be
very
late
for
aaron
and
the
coachman
had
driven
off
to
nullington
in
the
to
despatch
some
matter
of
business
for
miss
winter
was
that
a
knock
at
the
phemie
asked
dorothy
raising
her
voice
well
i
thought
i
heard
something
replied
phemie
the
only
servant
at
the
moment
in
the
kitchen
i
see
directly
it
only
jem
before
phemie
could
finish
buttering
the
muffin
she
had
been
toasting
the
gentle
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
a
second
time
phemie
ran
along
the
short
passage
and
opened
it
expecting
to
see
only
the
boy
she
started
back
in
some
alarm
at
sight
of
the
strange
figure
confronting
her
standing
between
the
two
lights
one
ruddy
and
homelike
that
streamed
out
of
the
kitchen
doorway
the
other
pallid
and
ghastly
that
was
dying
slowly
in
the
western
sky
phemie
saw
a
tall
and
woman
and
with
bright
black
eyes
a
scarlet
kerchief
was
bound
round
the
tangle
of
her
black
hair
a
faded
scarlet
shawl
was
draped
round
her
figure
and
knotted
behind
thick
hoops
of
gold
were
in
her
ears
rings
glittered
on
her
yellow
fingers
a
gipsy
without
any
doubt
as
phemie
after
the
first
moment
of
surprise
at
once
felt
assured
she
had
seen
women
attired
somewhat
like
her
in
the
country
lanes
round
about
in
her
astonishment
she
did
not
speak
but
the
stranger
did
do
be
afeard
honey
i
am
only
an
honest
gipsy
woman
who
has
lost
her
way
i
want
to
get
to
nullington
being
uncertain
o
the
road
i
thought
i
make
bold
to
turn
aside
here
and
ask
it
the
road
as
straight
as
you
can
go
answered
phemie
ah
but
it
you
that
have
a
pair
of
wicked
bright
brown
eyes
my
lass
whispered
the
gipsy
it
you
that
will
make
some
fine
young
man
heart
ache
cross
the
poor
gipsy
hand
with
a
bit
o
silver
and
she
tell
you
your
fortune
true
and
fair
phemie
would
have
liked
her
fortune
told
very
well
indeed
but
she
glanced
back
in
the
direction
of
stone
parlour
beyond
the
kitchen
i
dare
do
it
she
whispered
and
tried
to
shut
the
door
by
this
time
two
or
three
of
the
other
girls
had
come
up
and
were
gathering
round
there
ensued
some
laughing
and
giggling
i
want
to
tell
your
fortunes
said
the
gipsy
touching
one
and
another
in
a
persuasive
friendly
manner
i
heard
there
was
some
pretty
young
women
at
this
place
and
i
came
to
it
o
purpose
take
me
into
your
bright
kitchen
there
the
old
missis
she
do
be
in
the
way
whispered
the
buxom
who
was
from
sussex
sure
and
the
missus
would
want
to
deprive
you
of
hearing
o
the
future
and
the
sort
o
looks
o
the
man
that
waiting
for
ye
my
lass
returned
the
gipsy
walking
boldly
of
her
own
accord
into
the
kitchen
the
giggling
servants
followed
her
and
one
of
them
dexterously
drew
to
the
door
of
stone
parlour
phemie
hurried
in
with
the
which
she
arranged
on
the
round
table
and
in
going
out
shut
the
door
bright
sixpences
were
brought
forth
hands
were
crossed
with
the
silver
and
the
credulous
girls
listened
to
their
fortunes
presently
dorothy
stone
sipping
her
tea
and
eating
her
muffin
in
quietness
became
aware
of
some
unusual
sounds
as
of
murmurings
in
the
kitchen
interspersed
with
smothered
bursts
of
laughter
what
can
it
be
thought
dorothy
they
be
always
up
to
some
nonsense
when
aaron
away
opening
the
door
she
looked
out
upon
the
scene
the
wild
formidable
gipsy
woman
seated
in
her
scarlet
trappings
and
of
the
girls
standing
round
her
dorothy
very
much
startled
at
the
moment
shrieked
out
and
the
girls
looked
round
what
be
you
all
at
there
she
called
out
in
a
tremor
who
is
that
sally
this
kitchen
is
not
your
place
what
do
you
do
in
it
the
sussex
girl
who
may
have
been
addressed
because
she
was
the
tallest
and
biggest
turned
her
laughing
face
to
her
mistress
and
went
into
the
parlour
dorothy
not
feeling
herself
very
competent
to
cope
with
this
was
sitting
down
again
oh
missus
do
ye
not
be
angry
now
said
the
girl
in
her
way
we
be
only
having
our
fortins
told
she
be
gone
directly
she
do
be
and
say
as
my
man
be
a
soldier
and
i
have
to
ride
on
the
dorothy
took
heart
and
courage
what
would
miss
winter
say
if
she
knew
that
she
had
allowed
this
i
order
you
to
be
gone
she
said
her
quavering
voice
marring
the
implied
authority
in
no
small
degree
go
out
of
the
house
at
once
how
dared
you
to
come
into
it
who
is
that
cried
the
gipsy
hush
it
be
stone
the
housekeeper
whispered
phemie
you
had
better
go
the
gipsy
woman
rose
showing
her
large
white
teeth
and
strode
to
the
door
of
the
inner
room
let
the
poor
gipsy
tell
your
fortune
good
mistress
she
said
with
smiling
lips
and
a
curtsey
for
once
dorothy
was
roused
to
anger
go
away
you
bold
woman
she
cried
shrilly
do
attempt
to
tell
your
lies
to
me
you
have
told
enough
to
those
silly
girls
the
gipsy
face
darkened
she
strode
a
pace
or
two
into
the
room
i
have
been
telling
lies
have
i
well
then
let
me
tell
the
truth
to
you
and
bending
her
tall
form
she
whispered
a
few
words
rapidly
in
the
old
woman
ear
dorothy
face
turned
ashy
white
as
she
heard
them
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
with
a
low
cry
is
that
the
truth
or
is
it
not
asked
the
gipsy
but
dorothy
could
not
answer
she
could
only
stare
tremblingly
and
helplessly
at
the
the
gipsy
turned
to
the
wondering
maids
shut
that
door
and
leave
us
together
she
said
in
an
imperious
tone
this
good
mistress
here
and
i
have
something
to
say
to
each
other
the
door
was
closed
immediately
and
the
two
women
were
left
alone
the
servants
waited
long
enough
to
grow
uncomfortable
what
could
that
strange
gipsy
woman
be
doing
with
the
old
missis
we
had
better
go
in
and
see
that
all
right
at
length
spoke
phemie
who
had
perhaps
a
shade
more
thought
than
the
rest
she
may
have
frighted
her
into
a
fit
at
that
moment
the
parlour
door
was
opened
and
the
gipsy
came
out
shutting
the
door
behind
her
she
strode
through
the
kitchen
without
a
word
to
the
frightened
group
standing
there
let
herself
out
of
the
house
and
departed
by
the
shrubbery
as
she
had
come
the
servants
gazed
into
each
other
faces
in
silence
then
as
with
one
accord
they
opened
the
parlour
door
and
peeped
in
dorothy
stone
had
her
head
bent
on
the
table
beside
the
and
was
sobbing
tears
dreadful
to
hear
of
fright
distress
and
pain
chapter
x
the
truth
at
last
it
was
a
lovely
january
morning
sunny
but
cold
as
the
ladies
sat
around
the
at
heron
dyke
miss
winter
scarcely
spoke
a
word
during
the
meal
and
scarcely
touched
a
mouthful
she
seemed
buried
in
thought
what
is
the
matter
with
you
ella
asked
carlyon
noticing
this
surely
you
are
not
going
to
be
ill
i
was
never
better
in
all
my
life
aunt
gertrude
than
i
am
this
morning
answered
ella
with
her
sweet
serious
smile
only
i
do
not
seem
to
be
in
the
humour
for
talking
nor
for
eating
either
apparently
said
carlyon
with
a
shake
of
her
i
do
like
the
symptoms
and
if
you
have
not
recovered
your
appetite
at
luncheon
i
shall
think
it
time
to
send
for
dr
spreckley
at
which
ella
laughed
ella
put
on
her
hat
and
shawl
and
went
out
strolling
across
the
garden
towards
the
way
in
which
she
might
expect
the
approach
of
her
lover
he
was
already
in
sight
drawing
her
hand
within
his
arm
when
they
met
he
and
she
paced
about
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
talking
eagerly
it
was
the
day
subsequent
to
the
visit
to
the
kitchen
when
she
had
told
the
fortunes
of
the
maids
and
perhaps
of
dorothy
stone
and
this
conversation
ran
on
that
event
the
reader
will
very
probably
have
divined
that
the
visit
had
been
a
ruse
a
thing
planned
by
conroy
to
get
some
information
out
of
dorothy
going
indoors
ella
and
conroy
proceeded
to
the
old
which
had
not
been
used
since
his
death
a
fire
ordered
in
it
this
morning
burnt
brightly
on
the
hearth
ella
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
there
was
her
uncle
big
leathern
chair
with
the
screen
behind
it
as
in
the
days
that
were
gone
there
was
the
little
table
with
the
twisted
legs
that
used
to
stand
at
his
elbow
it
needed
but
a
slight
stretch
of
imagination
to
fancy
that
presently
the
squire
heavy
footstep
would
be
heard
that
he
would
come
in
with
his
curt
and
begin
at
once
to
poke
the
fire
which
was
a
thing
that
he
believed
no
one
could
do
as
well
as
himself
ella
eyes
filled
with
tears
courage
my
dear
whispered
conroy
think
of
the
present
just
now
not
of
the
past
she
brushed
away
her
tears
and
nodded
as
she
rang
the
bell
it
was
answered
by
one
of
the
maids
phemie
who
was
desired
to
inform
aaron
stone
that
his
mistress
waited
for
him
in
the
squire
old
room
aaron
received
the
message
with
an
incredulous
stare
you
must
be
dreaming
he
said
wrathfully
the
missus
in
that
cold
room
and
wanting
to
see
me
in
it
be
off
with
your
tales
is
it
cold
retorted
phemie
there
a
wood
fire
blazing
in
it
up
to
the
top
of
the
chimney
and
the
mistress
is
there
sir
with
conroy
and
she
is
waiting
for
you
aaron
obeyed
slowly
fuming
a
little
he
did
not
like
being
sent
for
by
miss
winter
and
talked
to
before
conroy
with
all
his
heart
he
wished
conroy
well
away
from
heron
dyke
he
was
the
only
man
whom
aaron
feared
his
look
of
cold
dark
grave
scrutiny
always
disconcerted
the
old
man
what
he
and
dorothy
should
do
when
conroy
married
the
mistress
and
became
master
of
heron
dyke
which
would
undoubtedly
be
the
case
before
long
was
a
thought
that
had
troubled
him
a
good
deal
of
late
aaron
paused
when
he
opened
the
door
and
shivered
as
he
looked
in
what
could
he
be
wanted
for
in
that
room
of
all
others
had
anything
been
found
out
come
in
aaron
said
miss
winter
shut
the
door
and
sit
down
she
was
leaning
back
in
one
of
the
smaller
chairs
conroy
stood
against
the
mantelpiece
the
old
man
took
a
chair
near
the
door
with
a
sinking
heart
some
considerable
time
ago
aaron
began
his
mistress
in
a
grave
but
not
unkindly
voice
i
put
certain
questions
to
you
bearing
reference
to
my
uncle
illness
and
death
i
had
been
led
to
suppose
that
some
mystery
attached
to
that
time
and
that
whatever
it
was
it
had
been
kept
and
was
intended
to
be
kept
from
me
you
denied
it
you
told
me
i
was
mistaken
no
no
miss
ella
i
kept
nothing
back
from
you
i
did
indeed
answered
the
old
man
in
a
trembling
beseeching
voice
his
agitation
pitiable
to
see
but
i
now
know
that
you
did
aaron
i
know
that
while
my
uncle
was
said
to
have
died
in
the
middle
of
may
he
really
died
weeks
and
weeks
before
that
date
will
you
tell
me
why
you
induced
me
to
believe
that
it
was
my
uncle
whom
john
tilney
and
the
choristers
from
nullington
saw
on
the
evening
of
his
birthday
and
whom
plackett
the
lawyer
from
london
saw
a
day
or
two
later
and
whom
daventry
partner
saw
when
you
knew
quite
well
that
it
was
you
yourself
dressed
up
so
as
to
personate
your
master
whom
each
and
all
of
them
beheld
aaron
teeth
began
to
chatter
the
truth
is
known
to
me
at
last
continued
ella
do
not
make
any
further
attempts
to
deceive
me
they
will
be
useless
quite
useless
struck
in
conroy
a
sternness
in
his
tone
that
miss
winter
had
lacked
we
know
all
what
little
tinge
of
colour
had
been
in
aaron
rugged
face
fled
from
it
he
looked
like
a
man
suddenly
stricken
with
some
mortal
sickness
he
turned
his
affrighted
eyes
from
his
mistress
to
conroy
and
from
conroy
to
her
again
better
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
said
conroy
quietly
i
will
at
length
spoke
aaron
in
a
husky
whisper
probably
seeing
that
no
other
course
remained
to
him
the
squire
did
die
afore
may
long
afore
his
birthday
too
the
of
april
it
was
a
dreadful
fraud
gasped
ella
ay
was
a
fraud
assented
aaron
it
was
not
me
though
that
set
it
agate
i
only
helped
to
carry
it
out
who
did
set
it
agate
asked
conroy
hubert
my
grandson
hubert
him
and
the
squire
between
them
the
squire
cried
ella
reproachfully
aaron
it
true
he
could
rest
for
fear
of
dying
before
his
birthday
old
spreckley
let
him
know
that
he
not
live
to
see
it
except
by
a
miracle
and
it
killed
him
hubert
thought
of
something
he
had
been
reading
just
then
in
one
of
his
french
books
of
a
gentleman
in
france
who
died
and
was
kept
alive
for
months
afterwards
leastways
was
said
to
be
kept
alive
to
deceive
the
world
he
told
the
squire
of
this
and
the
squire
caught
at
it
eagerly
and
they
spoke
to
jago
and
he
helped
to
carry
it
out
and
you
helped
too
said
conroy
i
did
it
for
the
best
for
the
best
sighed
aaron
the
tears
starting
to
his
eyes
as
he
slightly
lifted
his
wrinkled
hands
moreover
the
squire
ordered
me
and
when
did
i
ever
disobey
him
was
in
this
very
room
miss
ella
looking
across
at
her
that
he
first
spoke
to
me
i
had
come
in
to
get
him
ready
for
bed
and
he
told
me
about
it
at
the
first
blush
i
felt
frightened
to
death
i
said
to
him
it
ca
be
done
can
be
done
and
shall
be
done
how
dare
you
dissent
he
answered
me
angrily
and
i
did
dare
to
say
more
what
could
ella
answer
was
all
for
you
miss
ella
all
for
you
shivered
the
faithful
old
servant
for
faithful
he
was
despite
this
how
could
you
have
inherited
heron
dyke
had
the
master
not
lived
over
his
birthday
have
gone
right
away
to
the
other
people
a
nice
thing
for
that
other
denison
to
have
come
in
to
the
old
place
swindlers
and
spies
all
the
lot
of
if
be
silent
sternly
struck
in
conroy
how
dare
you
presume
so
to
speak
of
your
master
kinsman
aaron
looked
up
with
a
gasp
denison
of
nunham
priors
is
every
whit
as
honourable
as
the
late
denison
of
heron
dyke
take
care
how
you
speak
of
him
in
future
and
remember
that
he
is
denison
of
heron
dyke
now
and
would
have
been
so
ever
since
last
april
but
for
your
plotting
never
had
conroy
been
so
moved
so
stern
ella
though
assenting
in
her
heart
to
every
word
looked
at
him
in
surprise
aaron
felt
checked
and
mortified
he
thought
this
was
pretty
assumption
for
a
man
who
was
but
a
newspaper
reporter
and
would
have
liked
to
say
so
mistress
he
stammered
in
a
husky
voice
how
did
you
come
to
know
about
the
squire
that
i
must
decline
to
tell
you
spoke
miss
winter
it
is
enough
that
i
do
know
it
had
you
but
told
me
the
truth
when
i
first
questioned
you
what
annoyance
it
would
have
saved
both
myself
and
you
but
the
aged
retainer
could
only
reiterate
i
did
it
for
the
best
conroy
spoke
i
want
you
to
tell
me
aaron
the
real
date
of
the
squire
death
aaron
threw
a
quick
sour
suspicious
look
at
his
interlocutor
am
i
to
answer
that
question
miss
ella
he
asked
in
an
aggrieved
tone
certainly
well
then
if
you
must
know
sir
he
died
on
the
of
february
was
the
answer
grudgingly
given
the
of
february
what
did
you
do
then
why
what
should
we
do
but
put
the
body
into
a
coffin
that
had
been
ordered
from
london
two
months
before
by
the
squire
own
directions
hubert
ordered
it
and
it
was
sent
down
in
a
and
the
servants
were
told
that
it
was
a
new
sort
of
for
the
master
oh
and
this
coffin
nailed
down
i
suppose
was
kept
in
the
room
in
the
off
the
nobody
had
ever
thought
o
going
in
there
we
kept
the
room
locked
mostly
after
that
just
one
moment
interposed
ella
was
the
account
you
gave
me
of
my
uncle
death
what
happened
the
evening
it
took
place
a
true
one
every
word
answered
the
old
man
save
that
it
was
in
february
o
may
whose
idea
was
it
that
you
should
personate
your
master
after
his
death
resumed
conroy
aaron
did
not
answer
at
once
his
eyes
had
taken
a
dull
expression
as
though
he
were
lost
in
the
past
such
a
lot
o
things
had
to
be
done
that
was
at
first
thought
of
he
presently
said
nobody
can
foresee
what
ins
and
outs
a
matter
will
take
when
it
be
first
planned
hubert
saw
that
it
might
not
be
enough
to
say
the
squire
lived
over
his
birthday
people
might
clamour
to
see
him
and
convince
theirselves
of
it
and
jago
he
saw
it
also
yes
go
on
they
thought
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
that
i
must
be
dressed
up
to
personate
him
i
fought
against
it
i
did
indeed
miss
ella
lifting
his
eyes
to
his
mistress
but
was
o
no
manner
o
use
my
holding
out
for
as
they
pointed
out
to
me
all
might
have
been
discovered
unless
i
gave
in
so
they
dressed
you
up
cried
conroy
hubert
did
it
the
whole
scheme
was
carried
out
by
hubert
oh
but
he
was
a
clever
lad
an
amazing
clever
lad
jago
was
deep
and
cunning
but
he
had
not
the
talent
of
hubert
who
but
he
got
me
a
wig
to
imitate
the
squire
long
white
hair
and
a
velvet
i
had
to
put
them
and
the
on
every
day
and
be
drilled
for
an
hour
till
i
used
sometimes
to
half
fancy
that
i
had
been
transmogrified
into
the
squire
himself
it
took
in
daventry
partner
and
them
lawyer
rascals
from
london
finely
and
the
band
from
nullington
and
john
tilney
and
his
wife
i
had
on
the
ring
that
the
squire
had
worn
for
thirty
years
jago
was
in
the
secret
from
the
first
of
course
he
was
sir
he
was
just
the
man
for
a
job
of
that
sort
and
it
could
have
been
done
without
a
doctor
conroy
had
been
jotting
down
a
few
notes
in
his
i
think
that
is
all
for
the
present
he
said
to
aaron
if
any
other
questions
should
occur
to
me
i
can
ask
them
later
aaron
rose
stiffly
from
his
chair
to
his
ears
there
seemed
an
assumption
of
authority
of
power
in
conroy
excessively
distasteful
to
him
but
the
cloud
vanished
from
his
countenance
and
his
rugged
features
softened
as
his
eyes
rested
on
his
mistress
no
anger
no
haughty
condemnation
sat
on
that
fair
young
face
only
a
sort
of
sweet
patient
sadness
miss
ella
you
know
everything
now
he
whispered
moving
a
step
or
two
nearer
to
her
but
what
of
that
the
world
none
the
wiser
and
never
need
be
the
secret
as
safe
now
as
ever
it
was
yes
aaron
i
know
everything
answered
ella
a
little
wearily
i
know
that
i
am
no
longer
the
mistress
of
heron
dyke
i
know
that
the
dear
old
home
no
longer
belongs
to
me
but
to
another
but
i
also
know
that
he
will
be
a
worthy
inheritor
aaron
gasped
as
if
demented
but
miss
ella
you
have
only
to
hold
your
tongue
and
nobody
will
ever
be
a
bit
the
wiser
the
squire
bound
us
all
not
to
tell
you
but
now
that
you
found
it
out
for
yourself
there
no
harm
done
you
surely
would
not
tell
no
no
not
that
not
that
i
have
no
alternative
aaron
i
would
do
that
which
is
right
this
home
is
not
mine
it
must
be
given
up
to
him
to
whom
it
rightly
belongs
oh
miss
ella
my
master
would
turn
in
his
grave
if
he
could
hear
your
words
give
up
the
old
place
no
no
and
not
a
soul
who
knows
the
secret
but
ourselves
and
jago
and
the
nurse
and
their
mouths
are
sealed
if
my
uncle
out
of
that
larger
knowledge
which
i
doubt
not
is
now
his
were
permitted
to
counsel
me
do
you
not
think
he
would
urge
me
to
do
that
which
is
just
and
honourable
said
ella
condescending
to
reason
with
him
in
pity
for
his
evident
wretchedness
your
master
sees
now
with
other
eyes
than
those
he
saw
with
when
on
earth
he
would
not
ask
me
to
keep
what
is
not
and
never
has
been
mine
that
which
he
would
have
me
do
could
he
speak
to
me
is
the
thing
i
must
do
and
no
other
aaron
listened
but
he
was
not
convinced
to
think
of
the
estate
going
to
them
that
the
master
hated
so
sneaks
and
spies
not
another
word
severely
spoke
miss
winter
you
forget
yourself
aaron
the
old
man
bowed
his
head
and
let
his
arms
fall
by
his
side
with
a
gesture
of
despair
turning
he
hobbled
slowly
from
the
room
poor
faithful
old
soul
cried
ella
as
she
gazed
after
him
wrongly
though
he
has
acted
it
was
done
in
loyalty
to
my
uncle
and
me
and
so
edward
she
added
bravely
smiling
through
her
tears
you
see
that
you
will
not
have
a
bride
so
much
the
better
sweet
one
answered
conroy
stealing
his
arm
round
her
you
will
then
owe
something
to
me
instead
of
my
owing
so
much
to
you
nobody
can
now
call
me
a
they
have
not
called
you
one
have
they
not
ask
that
old
man
now
gone
out
what
he
thinks
of
me
in
his
private
thoughts
ask
your
aunt
gertrude
ask
toynbee
ask
the
world
i
am
sure
you
have
never
been
i
do
think
i
have
but
ella
it
will
be
a
sore
parting
this
of
yours
from
heron
dyke
i
try
not
to
think
of
it
yet
when
the
day
shall
come
i
shall
try
to
bear
it
as
i
best
may
who
knows
but
that
old
gentleman
at
nunham
priors
will
give
it
up
to
you
to
live
in
suggested
conroy
has
he
not
said
something
of
the
kind
to
you
and
do
you
think
i
would
impose
upon
his
generosity
by
staying
no
no
this
is
the
place
of
his
ancestors
and
it
must
be
his
his
entirely
and
his
son
after
him
you
forget
he
has
a
son
edward
one
master
frank
i
believe
a
graceless
young
fellow
by
all
accounts
that
may
be
but
he
is
still
a
denison
and
the
heir
after
his
father
besides
you
have
indeed
been
speaking
without
thought
edward
how
could
poor
people
such
as
we
shall
be
speaking
comparatively
live
at
a
grand
old
place
like
this
it
requires
a
grand
income
to
keep
it
up
dear
me
so
it
does
you
had
better
give
me
up
perhaps
edward
now
things
have
turned
out
for
the
worse
she
suggested
her
voice
slightly
trembling
i
shall
only
be
a
clog
upon
your
ambition
and
keep
you
down
do
you
think
so
he
rejoined
gravely
you
will
be
afraid
to
venture
on
marriage
with
a
man
so
poor
as
i
well
there
little
doubt
you
might
marry
a
rich
one
many
a
man
high
in
the
world
favour
might
be
glad
to
woo
and
win
you
young
ladies
with
only
a
tithe
of
your
good
looks
make
rich
marriages
every
season
why
should
not
you
you
have
always
be
enused
to
the
luxuries
and
refinements
of
life
it
would
be
a
misery
to
me
not
to
be
able
to
afford
you
them
still
had
we
not
better
part
ella
was
looking
at
him
with
a
startled
expression
in
her
eyes
as
if
she
were
half
afraid
he
might
be
in
earnest
and
was
taking
her
at
her
word
edward
conroy
pleasant
laugh
rang
out
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
tenderly
why
what
a
great
goose
you
are
he
said
as
if
you
did
not
know
that
our
love
was
altogether
independent
of
either
poverty
or
riches
and
that
neither
one
nor
the
other
of
them
could
affect
it
in
any
way
you
are
mine
and
i
am
yours
and
no
caprices
of
worldly
fortune
can
come
between
us
and
now
let
us
fling
our
cares
to
the
wind
for
a
little
while
and
forget
everything
except
that
we
do
love
each
other
and
that
the
sun
is
shining
and
that
rover
and
caprice
are
waiting
to
be
saddled
put
on
your
and
let
us
go
for
a
long
gallop
in
the
sweet
january
sunshine
if
we
are
not
to
have
many
more
rides
together
it
were
wise
to
enjoy
them
while
we
may
when
aaron
stone
quitted
the
presence
of
his
mistress
he
was
like
a
man
utterly
dazed
and
confounded
it
was
not
merely
the
shock
of
finding
that
the
elaborate
house
of
cards
which
he
and
others
had
helped
to
build
had
tumbled
to
pieces
so
suddenly
about
his
ears
that
dismayed
him
it
was
the
fact
of
miss
winter
having
succeeded
in
unravelling
a
plot
which
had
been
so
patiently
planned
and
so
carefully
guarded
from
discovery
that
nonplussed
the
old
retainer
so
far
as
he
was
aware
the
secret
of
the
squire
death
could
be
known
to
three
people
alone
to
himself
to
jago
and
to
dexter
hubert
was
no
longer
living
both
jago
and
dexter
had
been
well
paid
for
their
share
in
the
affair
and
neither
of
them
would
be
likely
to
speak
of
what
would
render
themselves
liable
to
a
criminal
prosecution
from
what
unknown
source
then
could
miss
winter
have
obtained
her
information
aaron
could
not
answer
and
the
oftener
he
asked
himself
the
question
the
more
puzzled
and
bewildered
he
became
as
to
that
bumptious
conroy
one
might
think
the
whole
place
belonged
to
him
to
see
him
and
hear
his
tones
there
witchcraft
in
it
altogether
that
what
there
is
concluded
the
dazed
old
man
and
witchcraft
there
was
in
it
but
of
a
kind
different
from
that
imagined
by
aaron
stone
convinced
that
dorothy
stone
knew
more
than
she
dared
tell
that
the
clue
to
the
secret
might
be
got
from
her
by
stratagem
though
perhaps
never
by
a
straightforward
examination
edward
conroy
set
his
wits
to
work
she
was
so
full
of
superstitious
fancies
and
beliefs
it
seemed
to
him
something
might
be
effected
by
playing
upon
them
at
first
miss
winter
objected
but
she
grew
to
see
that
if
the
means
used
were
not
perfectly
legitimate
the
end
to
be
obtained
certainly
was
in
fact
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
way
and
they
could
not
go
on
living
in
their
present
state
of
uncertainty
during
a
recent
visit
of
conroy
to
london
he
had
witnessed
a
representation
of
the
play
of
guy
mannering
and
had
been
much
struck
by
the
powerful
way
in
which
the
character
of
meg
merrilies
was
portrayed
the
actress
who
played
the
part
was
known
to
the
public
under
the
name
of
miss
murcott
she
was
a
lady
of
irreproachable
character
and
conroy
had
been
introduced
to
her
after
the
play
was
over
by
one
of
his
newspaper
friends
in
furtherance
of
the
object
he
had
now
in
view
he
went
up
to
london
again
sought
an
interview
with
the
actress
and
enlisted
her
sympathy
the
result
was
that
miss
murcott
went
down
to
nullington
and
took
up
her
abode
for
a
night
at
mrs
keen
who
had
been
prepared
to
receive
her
by
conroy
in
the
disguise
of
a
gipsy
and
under
pretence
of
telling
the
maids
of
heron
dyke
their
fortunes
she
obtained
access
to
dorothy
stone
aaron
absence
having
been
secured
by
his
mistress
using
the
information
confidentially
given
her
by
conroy
she
whispered
words
into
dorothy
ear
that
so
startled
her
as
to
render
her
pliable
as
a
lamb
give
me
your
hand
said
the
sham
gipsy
and
the
dazed
and
trembling
woman
held
it
out
without
a
dissenting
word
holding
the
withered
palm
in
her
own
the
gipsy
proceeded
to
scan
it
closely
tracing
the
different
lines
with
her
forefinger
this
indicates
a
coffin
she
said
and
dorothy
groaned
and
this
why
what
this
it
seems
to
point
to
a
hale
old
man
with
long
white
hair
who
wears
something
dark
on
his
head
and
is
put
into
the
coffin
before
oh
do
do
shrieked
dorothy
trying
in
vain
to
withdraw
her
hand
from
the
gipsy
firm
grasp
what
have
we
here
continued
the
a
darkened
room
where
people
walk
with
hushed
footsteps
green
doors
that
open
and
shut
without
noise
a
little
man
with
a
black
moustache
and
evil
eyes
and
this
dark
line
must
be
a
secret
a
secret
with
a
crime
in
it
that
might
drive
you
forth
from
your
grave
at
midnight
had
you
committed
it
i
did
commit
it
moaned
dorothy
they
never
let
me
know
of
it
no
but
you
found
it
out
you
hold
the
secret
this
line
shows
me
that
you
must
disclose
it
tell
it
at
once
before
it
be
too
late
too
late
what
shall
i
do
sobbed
dorothy
what
shall
i
do
what
i
bid
you
said
the
woman
sternly
tell
me
all
you
know
or
there
will
be
no
peace
for
you
living
or
dead
it
needed
no
more
to
induce
dorothy
to
do
as
she
was
bidden
with
many
sighs
and
groans
and
hesitations
her
story
came
out
little
by
little
it
appeared
that
in
those
past
days
the
curiosity
was
aroused
and
to
a
certain
extent
her
anger
also
at
being
kept
in
ignorance
of
what
was
going
on
behind
the
green
baize
doors
and
at
not
being
allowed
to
penetrate
beyond
them
herself
they
treat
me
as
if
i
was
a
common
she
would
say
with
bitterness
the
position
also
that
dexter
took
up
in
the
household
by
no
means
tended
to
soothe
these
ruffled
feelings
helped
to
nurse
the
master
for
the
last
twenty
years
when
he
has
been
ill
and
now
i
got
to
make
room
for
a
strange
woman
she
said
to
aaron
and
all
the
answer
dorothy
got
from
him
was
an
order
to
concern
herself
with
her
own
business
there
something
going
on
behind
those
doors
that
they
are
afeard
to
be
let
known
concluded
the
shrewd
old
woman
in
her
mind
dorothy
determined
to
go
beyond
the
doors
if
she
could
get
a
chance
of
it
and
tell
her
wrongs
to
the
squire
himself
and
she
watched
for
an
opportunity
it
came
at
last
one
afternoon
when
aaron
had
gone
to
nullington
he
came
home
all
the
worse
for
the
pints
of
strong
ale
he
had
taken
not
often
did
he
transgress
in
this
way
and
with
the
view
of
hiding
it
from
the
household
he
went
straight
to
bed
saying
the
sun
had
given
him
a
headache
and
fell
asleep
dorothy
filched
the
key
of
the
green
baize
doors
from
his
pocket
dexter
who
rarely
left
the
house
had
gone
this
afternoon
to
the
to
send
off
some
private
telegram
that
she
would
not
trust
to
anybody
else
and
hubert
stone
was
out
riding
in
a
perfect
flutter
of
excitement
dorothy
took
the
key
to
the
green
baize
doors
she
ventured
to
open
them
both
and
went
on
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
she
waited
for
the
answering
come
in
it
did
not
reach
her
ears
she
thought
he
might
be
dozing
and
opened
the
door
all
in
a
twitter
of
eagerness
to
ask
and
hear
from
her
master
why
she
was
excluded
the
room
was
empty
he
is
in
bed
thought
dorothy
and
went
to
the
chamber
that
also
was
empty
she
stood
bewildered
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
it
perhaps
the
squire
had
stepped
into
the
for
something
she
opened
its
door
gently
and
gave
one
glance
around
that
one
brief
look
was
quite
enough
a
low
scream
broke
from
her
lips
then
hardly
knowing
what
she
was
about
she
closed
the
door
and
fled
back
by
the
way
she
had
come
what
she
saw
in
the
third
room
was
a
closed
coffin
the
very
coffin
which
she
saw
carried
out
of
the
hall
some
two
months
later
on
the
day
of
denison
funeral
the
squire
must
be
dead
she
saw
that
but
why
were
they
concealing
it
watching
and
prying
about
after
this
dorothy
without
seeming
to
see
anything
saw
enough
to
convince
her
that
after
the
death
was
really
announced
to
the
world
it
was
no
other
than
her
own
husband
who
personated
the
dead
squire
she
stole
into
the
garden
the
night
the
musicians
were
playing
and
distinguished
aaron
features
in
his
master
clothes
the
day
charles
plackett
was
expected
from
london
dorothy
watched
and
saw
her
husband
turn
back
privately
and
go
stealing
into
the
squire
rooms
instead
of
proceeding
on
his
pretended
walk
to
nullington
all
this
was
confessed
to
the
gipsy
woman
who
in
her
turn
related
it
to
miss
winter
and
conroy
chapter
xi
converging
threads
events
now
began
to
follow
quickly
on
the
steps
of
each
other
philip
cleeve
had
not
yet
engaged
in
any
active
business
after
his
return
home
he
had
had
a
slight
relapse
and
spreckley
said
business
must
wait
old
marjoram
hearing
of
this
in
london
for
maria
often
wrote
to
him
sent
a
peremptory
mandate
for
philip
to
go
back
to
his
house
to
be
nursed
but
philip
was
getting
better
now
matters
were
arranged
with
tiplady
and
that
gentleman
had
already
ordered
a
new
brass
plate
for
his
tiplady
and
cleeve
architects
and
surveyors
the
necessary
money
had
been
paid
by
maria
and
the
vicar
did
not
withhold
his
sanction
philip
would
take
a
fair
income
for
a
year
or
two
then
become
full
partner
and
succeed
to
the
whole
whenever
it
should
please
tiplady
to
retire
it
was
a
very
fair
prospect
and
the
reverend
kettle
saw
no
cause
to
grumble
at
it
one
little
clause
known
only
to
daventry
who
drew
it
up
to
tiplady
and
to
philip
was
inserted
in
the
deed
of
partnership
it
was
to
the
effect
that
philip
could
not
come
upon
the
firm
for
any
money
whatever
beyond
his
salary
if
he
contracted
debts
tiplady
was
secured
from
the
fear
of
having
to
pay
them
it
is
only
a
matter
of
precaution
cleeve
inserted
as
much
for
your
own
sake
as
for
mine
tiplady
said
to
him
in
private
i
have
not
much
fear
that
you
will
be
playing
cards
for
high
stakes
again
or
betting
at
billiards
or
added
the
architect
with
a
grim
smile
investing
your
spare
cash
in
silver
mines
never
again
never
again
whispered
philip
tears
of
emotion
filling
his
eyes
as
he
clasped
the
hand
of
his
good
friend
the
paying
of
the
money
had
been
a
surprise
to
tiplady
knowing
as
he
did
philip
penniless
state
without
saying
a
word
to
her
husband
maria
had
gone
to
tiplady
and
had
made
over
to
him
the
twelve
hundred
pounds
which
long
before
he
had
agreed
with
lady
cleeve
should
be
the
amount
of
premium
to
be
paid
him
in
consideration
of
taking
philip
into
partnership
how
gratifying
to
philip
it
was
to
know
that
his
mother
was
never
to
hear
the
truth
of
his
folly
that
she
was
to
be
left
in
the
belief
that
the
money
she
had
made
him
a
loving
present
of
on
his
birthday
had
all
gone
in
the
silver
mine
in
her
fond
eyes
philip
always
remained
the
most
peerless
of
sons
what
a
weight
was
lifted
off
the
young
man
heart
by
this
generous
act
of
his
wife
from
that
day
forward
his
health
improved
rapidly
he
grew
again
like
the
merry
philip
cleeve
of
old
times
his
laugh
a
pleasure
to
hear
but
the
lesson
taught
him
was
not
one
to
be
readily
forgotten
and
there
would
be
one
sweet
presence
ever
by
his
side
to
see
that
his
footsteps
did
not
falter
and
to
cheer
him
onward
whenever
the
road
before
him
seemed
hard
and
difficult
to
travel
philip
cleeve
had
learnt
his
life
lesson
in
truth
he
had
been
more
lucky
than
he
deserved
and
he
was
to
be
more
so
yet
apart
from
his
past
follies
the
one
item
of
remembrance
that
made
him
wince
was
the
thought
that
his
wife
should
have
sacrificed
a
great
portion
of
her
little
fortune
to
patch
up
his
even
this
bitterness
was
to
be
taken
from
him
just
at
this
time
his
brother
sir
gunton
cleeve
was
despatched
to
england
on
some
mission
by
the
embassy
to
which
he
was
attached
and
he
snatched
an
opportunity
to
run
down
to
homedale
for
hours
to
him
philip
made
a
clean
breast
of
the
past
confessing
everything
the
the
the
personal
extravagance
in
the
shape
of
petty
ornaments
and
the
like
and
the
voracious
silver
mine
that
had
quite
finished
him
why
what
a
silly
young
fellow
you
must
have
been
exclaimed
the
baronet
i
know
it
gunton
to
my
cost
i
shall
know
it
all
my
days
sir
gunton
had
sown
a
few
wild
oats
during
his
youth
though
he
had
long
ago
steadied
down
and
he
was
not
inclined
to
be
too
severe
what
i
do
like
philip
is
this
that
your
wife
should
have
had
to
pay
the
premium
to
tiplady
it
looks
mean
for
us
what
does
the
mother
say
and
the
vicar
the
vicar
has
said
nothing
to
me
i
do
think
he
intends
to
blow
me
up
he
has
been
very
good
i
must
confess
all
he
said
to
maria
was
that
the
money
was
her
own
and
he
could
not
interfere
as
to
the
mother
gunton
she
knows
nothing
of
my
wicked
folly
she
thinks
the
twelve
hundred
pounds
was
all
swallowed
up
by
the
mine
maria
went
to
tiplady
and
paid
over
the
money
without
saying
a
word
to
anybody
well
look
here
philip
i
ca
stand
this
a
cleeve
was
never
mean
yet
at
least
in
our
day
i
am
not
rich
as
you
know
but
i
can
manage
this
much
i
will
pay
the
premium
to
tiplady
that
is
i
will
refund
the
money
to
maria
and
you
had
better
let
it
be
settled
upon
her
but
i
do
it
in
the
belief
that
you
will
never
play
at
folly
again
understand
that
young
fellow
the
tears
had
rushed
to
philip
eyes
oh
gunton
you
may
trust
me
how
generous
you
are
when
philip
had
done
thanking
him
they
began
to
talk
of
captain
lennox
and
the
suspicions
attaching
to
him
where
is
he
now
asked
sir
gunton
nobody
knows
he
ca
be
found
by
the
police
or
by
anybody
else
by
the
way
you
knew
him
three
or
four
years
ago
gunton
knew
him
retorted
sir
gunton
knew
lennox
any
way
you
have
seen
him
you
met
him
at
cheltenham
at
major
piper
young
conroy
a
fellow
up
at
heron
dyke
told
me
that
much
the
major
had
a
and
you
and
lennox
were
both
at
it
he
said
and
the
next
day
the
major
jewels
were
missing
if
you
recollect
you
spent
a
few
days
at
cheltenham
about
that
time
yes
i
did
and
i
recollect
the
evening
lennox
lennox
ay
i
do
remember
him
now
a
fair
slender
man
of
very
gentlemanly
manners
wore
a
white
rose
in
his
that
he
one
can
hardly
believe
him
to
be
an
accomplished
swindler
if
he
played
these
pranks
often
helping
himself
to
jewels
and
purses
and
the
like
he
must
have
been
uncommonly
lucky
to
go
on
so
long
without
detection
observed
sir
gunton
the
very
remark
conroy
made
to
me
pray
who
is
conroy
the
luckiest
man
living
replied
philip
with
enthusiasm
that
saying
a
good
deal
cried
the
baronet
lifting
his
eyebrows
well
upon
my
word
i
think
he
is
gunton
returned
philip
he
is
nothing
but
a
man
connected
with
newspapers
draws
cartoons
for
them
or
something
of
that
he
and
miss
winter
met
somewhere
and
fell
in
love
with
one
another
and
she
means
to
marry
him
and
make
him
the
master
of
heron
dyke
oh
indeed
what
next
i
think
that
pretty
well
you
ca
say
but
he
is
lucky
is
the
man
a
sneak
just
the
opposite
a
masterful
kind
of
man
who
can
hold
his
own
with
his
betters
and
apparently
not
recognise
them
to
be
so
to
see
him
and
hear
him
you
might
think
he
had
been
born
the
master
of
heron
dyke
at
least
any
way
that
what
ella
winter
intends
him
to
become
she
has
the
denison
blood
in
her
veins
i
suppose
and
we
know
the
old
distich
carelessly
remarked
sir
gunton
a
denzon
choose
to
do
need
surprise
nor
me
nor
you
the
small
at
heron
dyke
of
which
miss
winter
spoke
to
her
housekeeper
was
held
without
much
delay
philip
getting
strong
then
was
able
to
attend
it
with
his
mother
and
maria
lady
maria
skeffington
who
had
been
taking
a
good
deal
of
notice
of
maria
since
her
marriage
the
vicar
and
spreckley
completed
the
party
dinner
was
over
and
they
were
all
back
in
the
large
when
the
evening
post
was
brought
in
it
was
some
hours
late
the
postman
said
there
had
been
a
on
the
line
three
or
four
newspapers
came
in
and
one
letter
which
was
addressed
to
miss
winter
it
bore
the
american
and
ella
curiosity
arose
not
so
much
because
she
knew
no
one
in
america
as
that
she
thought
the
handwriting
was
margaret
ducie
oh
i
must
open
it
she
exclaimed
taking
it
into
the
next
room
the
intervening
doors
were
open
and
they
watched
her
read
the
letter
she
came
back
with
it
in
her
hand
looking
a
little
pale
it
is
from
ducie
she
said
in
a
low
tone
to
her
guests
it
is
dated
from
rhode
island
america
i
think
you
ought
to
hear
it
perhaps
turning
to
conroy
you
will
read
it
aloud
conroy
took
the
letter
from
her
hand
glanced
over
it
and
began
ducie
late
of
the
lilacs
near
nullington
takes
the
liberty
of
addressing
a
few
lines
to
miss
winter
of
heron
dyke
she
does
it
with
great
reluctance
as
miss
winter
will
readily
understand
but
the
charge
is
laid
upon
her
and
she
can
not
evade
it
the
time
being
now
come
when
certain
facts
connected
with
the
past
must
be
made
known
ducie
brother
known
to
miss
winter
and
to
others
as
captain
lennox
died
two
days
ago
enclosed
is
a
declaration
which
he
dictated
word
for
word
before
his
death
with
a
request
that
it
might
be
forwarded
to
the
proper
quarter
immediately
after
that
event
should
have
taken
place
ducie
can
make
no
attempt
to
palliate
anything
that
happened
in
the
past
as
it
was
so
it
must
remain
if
all
were
known
which
it
never
can
be
here
on
earth
it
would
sometimes
be
found
that
the
greatest
sinners
were
first
driven
into
sin
by
no
wish
or
will
of
their
own
many
who
were
destined
to
fill
an
honourable
career
have
been
forced
by
circumstances
which
they
could
not
control
on
a
contrary
path
the
dead
are
sacred
and
she
who
is
obliged
to
write
these
painful
lines
can
never
forget
that
she
has
lost
a
brother
who
whatever
his
faults
might
be
was
dearer
to
her
heart
than
anyone
now
left
to
her
such
was
ducie
note
the
enclosed
paper
was
also
in
her
handwriting
conroy
went
on
to
read
it
ferdinand
lennox
or
the
man
commonly
known
by
that
name
being
about
to
quit
this
petty
planet
and
set
out
on
my
travels
to
that
unknown
country
from
which
there
is
no
return
am
desirous
while
there
is
still
sufficient
strength
and
clearness
of
mind
left
me
to
state
the
facts
with
regard
to
a
certain
event
as
they
really
occurred
which
facts
will
probably
be
found
to
be
somewhat
different
from
what
the
world
believes
them
to
be
i
allude
to
the
death
of
hubert
stone
fates
had
been
unpropitious
for
some
time
circumstances
were
against
me
i
had
lost
heavily
on
the
turf
and
in
other
speculations
and
was
nearly
at
my
wit
end
for
lack
of
ready
money
it
was
at
this
time
that
my
sister
quite
innocently
told
me
of
the
strange
discovery
of
a
quantity
of
old
family
jewels
at
heron
dyke
in
justice
to
her
my
good
and
faithful
sister
i
may
here
remark
that
since
she
came
to
live
with
me
i
have
been
more
cautious
and
have
striven
to
keep
my
little
peccadilloes
from
her
knowledge
she
may
have
thought
sometimes
that
my
luck
at
the
was
something
out
of
the
common
way
but
of
the
darker
passages
of
my
life
she
knew
absolutely
nothing
did
not
take
me
long
to
decide
that
i
must
make
those
jewels
mine
if
it
were
by
any
means
possible
to
do
so
my
circumstances
just
then
were
desperate
and
a
de
had
become
absolutely
necessary
burglary
was
altogether
out
of
my
line
but
in
this
case
the
enterprise
seemed
to
me
so
peculiarly
an
easy
one
that
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
forego
it
i
knew
the
position
of
the
room
in
which
the
jewels
were
lying
i
knew
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
opening
a
window
and
forcing
a
shutter
after
the
family
should
be
safe
in
bed
there
were
no
dogs
to
fear
and
the
servants
slept
in
another
wing
of
the
house
nothing
could
possibly
be
more
easy
i
felt
that
i
could
never
forgive
myself
if
i
allowed
such
an
opportunity
to
escape
me
to
a
certain
point
everything
happened
in
accordance
with
my
expectations
the
hall
was
in
darkness
there
was
no
sign
of
life
anywhere
i
found
the
window
i
was
in
search
of
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
stood
inside
the
room
i
opened
a
slide
of
my
dark
lantern
and
took
a
survey
there
stood
the
bureau
in
the
corner
where
i
had
expected
to
find
it
i
had
brought
a
small
chisel
and
one
or
two
other
implements
with
me
and
a
very
little
time
sufficed
to
force
open
the
receptacle
in
which
the
jewels
were
stored
what
a
fine
glow
filled
my
heart
as
i
feasted
my
sight
for
a
few
moments
on
their
flashing
beauty
and
recognised
the
fact
that
they
were
all
my
own
for
some
time
to
come
my
finances
were
assured
was
wearing
an
old
with
many
pockets
so
that
i
had
no
difficulty
in
stowing
away
my
booty
i
was
putting
away
the
last
handful
when
a
noise
behind
me
made
me
start
and
look
round
there
was
just
enough
starlight
to
enable
me
to
discern
the
figure
of
a
man
standing
at
the
open
window
and
gazing
into
the
room
flashing
a
ray
from
my
lantern
across
his
face
i
at
once
recognised
the
man
as
hubert
stone
a
moment
later
he
had
vaulted
over
the
low
into
the
room
you
villain
he
cried
it
will
be
worse
for
you
i
did
not
answer
but
moved
noiselessly
in
the
darkness
over
the
soft
carpet
to
another
corner
of
the
room
he
was
evidently
nonplussed
and
after
standing
still
for
a
moment
or
two
i
could
just
make
out
his
figure
as
he
advanced
slowly
but
in
a
direction
opposite
to
the
spot
where
i
was
standing
now
was
my
opportunity
i
made
a
rush
for
the
window
reached
it
and
was
leaping
from
it
when
as
would
have
it
my
foot
caught
against
the
framework
and
i
fell
face
downward
on
to
the
gravelled
pathway
hurt
and
bleeding
i
regained
my
feet
but
only
to
find
myself
enclosed
by
the
stalwart
arms
of
young
stone
he
said
again
again
i
made
no
answer
hoping
he
had
not
recognised
me
and
a
desperate
struggle
began
between
us
but
he
was
the
younger
and
the
stronger
and
presently
we
were
rolling
over
each
other
on
the
ground
it
must
have
been
then
that
i
lost
the
which
loss
has
led
to
all
the
mischief
as
regards
myself
although
i
could
by
no
means
get
away
from
stone
he
was
unable
altogether
to
overpower
me
suddenly
while
holding
me
down
with
his
right
hand
with
his
left
he
drew
from
some
inner
pocket
a
closed
knife
which
with
the
help
of
his
teeth
he
presently
contrived
to
open
you
will
not
surrender
he
said
will
mark
you
so
that
you
can
be
traced
wherever
you
go
what
he
was
about
to
do
i
know
not
but
i
suddenly
struck
up
my
arm
and
the
knife
flew
out
of
his
hand
his
object
was
now
to
regain
possession
of
it
while
mine
was
to
keep
him
from
doing
so
we
were
still
struggling
on
the
ground
when
i
know
not
how
it
was
but
suddenly
my
fingers
felt
the
knife
as
it
lay
among
the
gravel
i
gripped
it
instinctively
and
drew
it
towards
me
and
stone
perceived
that
i
had
got
it
he
bent
suddenly
forward
to
regain
possession
of
it
but
as
he
did
so
the
point
slipped
and
penetrated
deep
into
his
chest
a
short
sharp
cry
broke
from
his
lips
he
sprang
to
his
feet
at
a
single
bound
threw
up
his
hands
staggered
a
pace
or
two
groaned
and
fell
on
his
face
no
doubt
dead
for
all
let
me
assert
most
solemnly
and
at
a
time
when
to
tell
a
lie
in
the
matter
could
be
of
no
possible
benefit
to
me
that
i
am
utterly
guiltless
of
intentionally
causing
hubert
stone
death
his
fate
was
the
result
of
an
accident
brought
on
by
his
own
rashness
had
he
left
the
knife
in
his
pocket
he
would
have
been
alive
at
the
present
moment
although
how
the
struggle
would
have
terminated
in
that
case
and
what
might
have
happened
to
me
is
another
matter
having
confessed
to
so
much
it
maybe
some
relief
to
the
minds
of
certain
people
if
i
reveal
one
or
two
other
secrets
which
in
comparison
are
trifles
be
it
known
then
that
it
was
i
ferdinand
lennox
who
appropriated
carlyon
and
booties
watch
and
chain
and
the
old
doctor
gold
box
together
with
one
or
two
minor
articles
that
i
happened
to
find
close
to
my
hands
hands
that
had
acquired
remarkable
dexterity
in
the
art
of
conveyancing
and
really
if
unthinking
people
will
place
such
flagrant
temptations
in
the
way
of
poor
erring
humanity
they
are
decidedly
to
blame
for
it
serves
to
entice
otherwise
innocent
people
into
had
no
thoughtless
person
ever
put
temptations
before
me
even
my
dark
plumage
might
have
been
far
whiter
than
it
is
now
now
that
my
task
is
over
it
has
cost
me
some
pain
if
only
from
the
sight
of
my
poor
sister
tears
that
drop
on
her
writing
as
she
sits
by
the
bed

subscribe

name
for
the
last
time

cried
the
vicar
if
we
were
all
to
be
abandoned
for
the
sins
committed
by
our
friends
and
relatives
the
world
would
be
harder
than
it
is
to
have
had
such
a
brother
so
sweet
a
woman
as
that
margaret

seemed
to
be
poor

may

pretty
well

it
must
have
been

to

you
were
indebted
for
the
loss
of

he
added
to

ay
said
the
vicar
i
remember
quite
well
that
he
stood
talking
to
me
for
some
little
time
just
before
the
party
broke
up
the
fellow
was
so
pleasant
that
no
one
on
earth
would
have
taken
him
for
a
pickpocket
dear
me
what
curious
experiences
we
pick
up
in
life
the
discovery
made
of
the
treacherous
plot
enacted
at
heron
dyke
was
not
to
be
proclaimed
to
the
world
it
reflected
discredit
on
the
old
squire
as
much
as
on
his
subordinates
and
miss
winter
was
anxious
to
spare
his
memory
but
to
one
or
two
people
it
must
necessarily
be
disclosed
ella
intending
to
bespeak
their
secrecy
daventry
was
the
first
to
hear
it
ella
accompanied
by
her
aunt
proceeded
to
london
daventry
travelling
by
the
same
train
conroy
had
left
nullington
the
day
before
upon
business
of
his
own
the
object
of
ella
visit
was
to
see
charles
plackett
and
inform
him
that
she
was
now
prepared
to
yield
up
the
property
to
his
client
at
nunham
priors
but
she
meant
to
ask
the
favour
of
denison
of
being
allowed
to
remain
at
heron
dyke
herself
for
a
short
period
longer
until
in
fact
she
quitted
it
with
conroy
for
good
which
she
felt
sure
the
kind
old
man
would
accord
ella
had
told
her
aunt
something
but
not
all
she
gave
her
to
understand
that
in
consequence
of
some
flaw
in
the
heron
dyke
had
become
the
property
of
the
other
branch
of
the
family
there
is
no
need
to
dwell
on
carlyon
perturbation
of
spirit
when
she
found
that
her
niece
was
determined
to
give
up
everything
of
her
own
free
will
of
her
own
free
will
that
is
how
carlyon
looked
at
it
when
first
the
news
was
broken
to
her
she
cried
and
implored
ella
not
to
be
so
romantically
foolish
so
ridiculously
quixotic
if
there
is
any
flaw
in
the
it
is
their
place
to
find
it
out
and
not
yours
to
show
it
them
she
reiterated
but
ella
assured
her
that
she
could
not
help
herself
other
choice
was
left
that
in
fact
the
estate
had
been
denison
ever
since
her
uncle
death
it
a
little
appeased
carlyon
she
kissed
ella
and
remarked
that
what
must
be
must
be
and
in
the
gratification
of
once
more
getting
to
her
own
home
carlyon
recovered
her
spirits
ella
was
her
guest
that
night
and
the
following
morning
proceeded
to
keep
the
appointment
already
made
with
charles
plackett
daventry
meeting
her
there
in
a
very
few
words
miss
winter
stated
her
business
recalling
to
mind
their
interview
at
heron
dyke
and
what
passed
thereat
she
went
on
to
state
that
since
that
time
certain
fresh
circumstances
had
come
to
her
knowledge
in
consequence
of
which
she
had
decided
to
give
up
the
property
to
denison
what
the
circumstances
in
question
were
she
declined
to
say
at
least
at
present
and
begged
that
she
might
not
be
pressed
to
explain
all
she
wished
was
that
denison
would
quietly
accept
that
which
she
had
of
her
own
free
will
come
to
offer
him
without
inquiring
too
curiously
into
the
past
in
short
charles
plackett
understood
that
she
wished
to
have
no
thought
of
persecuting
this
person
or
indicting
that
one
there
must
be
a
complete
condonation
of
what
might
have
happened
in
the
time
gone
by
during
this
daventry
sat
by
and
said
nothing
he
was
but
there
to
give
as
it
were
legality
to
this
avowed
resolution
of
miss
winter
in
fact
to
show
the
other
side
that
it
was
not
made
lightly
or
in
jest
i
perceive
nodded
charles
plackett
gazing
at
his
brother
lawyer
you
have
obtained
information
that
you
consider
to
be
conclusive
as
to
my
client
rightful
claims
but
the
particulars
of
which
you
do
not
wish
to
be
inquired
into
that
is
so
replied
miss
winter
is
my
esteemed
friend
here
if
i
may
put
the
question
to
him
cognisant
of
these
particulars
yes
i
am
spoke
up
daventry
and
i
am
prepared
to
testify
if
necessary
that
denison
need
entertain
no
scruple
whatever
as
to
assuming
possession
of
the
estate
miss
winter
resigns
it
to
him
from
charles
plackett
looked
at
her
earnestly
it
will
be
a
great
sacrifice
on
your
part
my
dear
young
lady
yes
it
will
i
do
not
deny
that
acknowledged
ella
involuntary
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
but
i
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
none
all
i
would
ask
of
denison
is
that
he
will
allow
me
to
remain
in
the
house
for
a
short
while
longer
a
very
few
weeks
at
the
most
charles
plackett
smiled
amiably
that
small
request
will
be
granted
as
a
matter
of
course
my
dear
miss
winter
remember
some
words
spoken
by
my
client
in
this
very
room
not
long
ago
either
though
it
were
proved
that
heron
dyke
did
belong
to
him
he
said
he
would
like
that
charming
young
lady
to
retain
it
ella
smiled
faintly
and
shook
her
head
that
can
not
be
she
answered
but
i
do
not
feel
the
less
indebted
to
denison
for
the
kindness
that
prompted
the
thought
chapter
xii
more
surprises
than
one
miss
winter
remained
in
london
with
her
aunt
three
or
four
days
she
had
some
purchases
to
make
preparatory
to
her
nuptials
and
consultations
to
hold
with
her
dressmaker
neither
did
carlyon
care
to
quit
her
house
again
without
giving
a
few
days
to
it
on
the
morning
preceding
that
on
which
they
were
to
travel
down
to
heron
dyke
they
were
surprised
not
knowing
he
was
in
london
to
see
conroy
he
had
been
somewhere
in
the
country
and
my
visit
was
a
failure
he
said
to
ella
the
friend
whom
i
went
to
see
was
absent
from
home
i
waited
a
day
or
two
but
as
he
did
not
return
i
came
up
have
you
been
he
carelessly
asked
she
repeated
no
seeing
that
heron
dyke
is
to
be
given
up
it
will
be
necessary
to
fix
upon
some
nest
or
other
will
it
not
he
continued
ella
eyelashes
grew
wet
in
a
moment
and
she
turned
away
her
head
a
little
while
and
the
old
home
that
she
had
known
and
loved
all
her
life
would
be
hers
no
longer
how
bitter
the
parting
would
be
no
one
but
herself
could
tell
and
there
will
be
the
furniture
to
select
continued
conroy
in
the
same
light
tone
chairs
and
tables
and
carpets
and
and
a
thousand
other
things
that
we
ca
do
without
but
all
that
i
shall
leave
to
you
i
hope
you
wo
do
anything
of
the
kind
said
ella
in
some
alarm
i
should
be
the
greatest
ignoramus
in
the
world
at
selecting
furniture
and
i
should
not
be
one
whit
better
lamented
conroy
carlyon
we
shall
have
to
fall
back
upon
you
you
must
purchase
for
us
time
enough
for
that
returned
carlyon
rather
crossly
any
reminder
of
the
giving
up
of
heron
dyke
put
her
out
at
once
you
intend
to
travel
you
both
tell
me
for
two
or
three
months
after
your
marriage
you
can
come
to
me
when
you
return
and
look
out
for
a
house
then
so
be
it
said
conroy
carlyon
and
ella
returned
to
heron
dyke
together
conroy
travelling
to
nullington
with
them
just
to
make
sure
that
they
got
down
in
safety
he
observed
laughingly
on
the
next
day
or
the
next
day
but
one
he
should
have
to
go
back
again
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
ella
entered
her
home
not
much
longer
would
she
be
able
to
call
it
her
own
indeed
the
feeling
of
its
being
hers
had
already
left
her
in
her
heart
she
began
to
say
farewell
to
all
the
sweet
familiar
places
that
seemed
now
almost
as
if
they
were
a
part
of
herself
no
whisper
had
yet
gone
abroad
of
any
impending
changes
at
the
hall
neither
had
the
servants
been
spoken
to
it
was
best
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
until
the
last
moment
drew
nearer
so
long
as
she
remained
at
the
hall
miss
winter
did
not
care
to
become
an
object
of
commiseration
or
listen
to
the
condolences
of
the
neighbourhood
after
she
was
gone
people
might
talk
as
they
pleased
her
thoughts
had
other
things
to
dwell
upon
beside
the
sweet
sorrows
of
farewell
before
her
stretched
a
strange
new
unknown
life
a
sea
whose
depths
and
whose
shallows
she
had
not
yet
fathomed
and
sometimes
the
prospect
half
affrighted
her
but
when
she
thought
of
conroy
and
how
her
heart
was
safely
anchored
in
his
love
a
trusting
courage
came
back
to
her
he
was
the
pilot
of
her
whatever
storms
might
come
whatever
winds
might
blow
so
long
as
he
was
at
the
helm
she
would
not
be
afraid
on
the
morning
but
one
after
miss
winter
return
to
heron
dyke
aaron
stone
was
crossing
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
hall
when
he
saw
an
elderly
gentleman
within
its
gates
pacing
to
and
fro
and
turning
himself
about
he
seemed
to
be
examining
the
house
from
different
points
of
view
in
a
manner
that
aaron
deemed
to
be
the
height
of
impudence
aaron
had
hated
strangers
all
his
life
and
he
made
no
ado
about
walking
up
to
this
one
and
demanding
by
whose
authority
he
was
in
the
private
grounds
of
heron
dyke
the
old
gentleman
turned
to
face
him
ah
you
are
aaron
stone
i
expect
i
have
heard
of
you
before
said
the
stranger
as
he
peered
at
aaron
through
his
eyeglass
well
i
am
denison
of
nunham
priors
here
is
my
card
take
it
to
miss
winter
and
ask
her
whether
she
can
oblige
me
with
an
interview
aaron
gave
a
great
start
at
mention
of
the
name
and
shrank
back
a
step
or
two
this
little
inoffensive
elderly
gentleman
the
man
he
had
all
his
life
been
taught
to
hate
and
whom
he
had
always
pictured
to
himself
as
more
of
a
demon
than
a
man
he
could
hardly
believe
the
evidence
of
his
eyes
and
stood
staring
at
a
respectful
distance
take
the
card
man
alive
what
are
you
afraid
of
cried
out
denison
and
there
was
so
much
in
the
impatient
commanding
tone
ay
and
in
the
words
themselves
that
put
aaron
in
mind
of
the
other
denison
his
late
master
now
dead
and
gone
that
he
took
the
card
at
once
and
hobbled
off
with
it
denison
watched
him
with
an
amused
smile
ella
was
in
her
alone
when
the
old
servitor
came
in
with
a
face
white
as
milk
oh
miss
ella
he
has
come
at
last
but
do
you
see
him
do
you
speak
to
him
the
old
squire
will
turn
in
his
coffin
if
you
do
who
is
here
exclaimed
ella
who
is
it
that
i
am
not
to
see
he
is
outside
on
the
lawn
there
taking
his
views
of
the
house
but
if
he
once
gets
inside
there
no
knowing
what
may
happen
keep
him
out
miss
ella
keep
him
out
but
by
this
time
ella
had
the
card
between
her
fingers
flinging
down
her
sewing
she
ran
out
to
the
lawn
with
a
glowing
face
of
welcome
aaron
mouth
fell
to
him
the
end
of
the
world
seemed
at
hand
i
am
so
glad
you
are
come
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
cried
ella
with
outstretched
hands
denison
drew
the
blushing
girl
toward
him
and
kissed
her
tenderly
you
do
know
how
pleased
i
am
to
see
you
again
he
said
what
would
i
not
give
if
i
had
a
daughter
like
you
how
did
you
get
here
where
did
you
come
from
i
came
down
from
london
last
night
my
dear
and
was
driven
to
a
country
inn
a
mile
or
two
away
i
like
your
country
inns
they
are
pretty
sure
to
be
comfortable
and
i
walked
here
this
morning
i
am
good
for
a
few
miles
walk
yet
you
will
come
in
said
ella
as
she
linked
her
arm
in
his
it
is
your
own
house
now
you
know
that
is
a
fact
with
which
i
shall
not
be
able
to
familiarise
myself
for
some
time
to
come
replied
denison
i
have
not
set
foot
inside
heron
dyke
since
i
was
a
lad
of
nineteen
dear
dear
what
changes
in
the
world
and
in
me
too
since
that
time
they
sat
down
in
ella
pleasant
little
room
overlooking
the
and
the
park
and
is
this
strange
news
that
charles
plackett
has
told
me
really
true
asked
denison
quite
true
dear
denison
said
ella
hiding
her
quivering
lip
i
was
told
not
to
ask
any
questions
and
i
wo
although
i
may
have
some
opinions
of
my
own
in
the
matter
which
may
or
may
not
be
near
the
truth
however
we
will
let
that
pass
i
have
been
anxious
to
see
you
ever
since
i
heard
the
news
from
plackett
wishful
too
to
see
the
old
once
again
for
i
am
as
much
a
denison
as
my
cousin
was
but
there
were
two
or
three
interesting
sales
coming
off
in
london
and
i
waited
for
and
you
are
glad
to
see
me
are
you
i
am
indeed
can
you
doubt
it
well
no
i
ca
for
your
tone
and
your
face
tell
it
me
as
well
as
your
words
and
now
my
dear
what
i
am
come
to
say
is
this
heron
dyke
must
continue
to
be
your
home
in
time
to
come
as
it
has
been
in
time
gone
by
however
much
i
may
esteem
the
old
place
i
should
not
care
to
live
here
i
am
too
old
to
change
my
as
regards
the
revenues
we
can
come
to
some
arrangement
about
them
after
a
time
you
have
behaved
so
nobly
in
this
matter
that
i
will
see
you
do
not
suffer
and
you
may
safely
leave
your
interests
in
my
hands
all
i
wish
is
that
things
should
go
on
here
as
they
have
gone
on
hitherto
you
shall
continue
to
be
mistress
of
heron
dyke
ella
shook
her
head
it
can
not
be
dear
denison
she
answered
through
her
tears
and
why
can
it
not
be
i
should
like
to
know
if
i
say
that
it
shall
be
the
peremptory
tone
was
her
uncle
over
again
but
with
a
quaint
geniality
in
it
which
his
had
lacked
ella
did
not
answer
at
first
her
face
was
rosy
red
i
am
going
to
be
married
she
said
in
a
low
tone
so
it
is
not
fit
that
i
should
continue
to
be
the
mistress
here
my
husband
would
be
the
master
and
i
fear
he
would
not
care
that
his
wife
should
be
dependent
on
anyone
bounty
not
even
on
yours
dear
mr
denison
a
pained
look
came
into
denison
face
well
well
i
might
have
had
the
sense
to
know
that
some
young
fellow
would
not
fail
to
secure
such
a
treasure
i
was
foolish
enough
to
dream
that
you
and
my
boy
might
perhaps
in
time
meet
and
learn
to
like
each
other
and
then
but
all
that
is
at
an
end
now
well
well
ella
was
gazing
sadly
out
of
the
window
there
was
silence
for
a
little
while
i
hope
the
husband
you
have
chosen
will
take
you
to
as
good
a
home
as
this
my
dear
is
he
rich
no
he
has
four
hundred
certain
and
four
hundred
interrupted
denison
in
a
tone
of
contempt
why
i
allow
my
scapegrace
son
as
much
as
that
tut
tut
you
marry
a
man
who
has
but
four
hundred
and
i
have
as
much
or
nearly
as
much
continued
ella
dear
denison
we
shall
do
very
well
very
well
after
heron
dyke
denison
gave
an
emphatic
sniff
my
dear
i
have
taken
a
great
liking
to
you
as
much
as
if
you
were
my
daughter
and
i
do
care
to
hear
of
this
i
do
approve
of
it
four
hundred
is
your
son
come
home
from
abroad
inquired
ella
to
change
the
conversation
after
a
pause
of
silence
oh
yes
he
has
come
home
the
graceless
dog
came
down
to
eat
his
christmas
dinner
with
me
at
nunham
priors
stayed
but
a
day
or
two
though
is
he
so
very
graceless
that
as
may
be
he
thinks
himself
a
model
of
a
son
for
duty
reminded
me
once
when
i
was
blowing
him
up
that
he
had
never
given
me
a
moment
care
in
his
life
oh
master
frank
one
that
wo
be
sat
upon
even
by
me
and
has
he
never
given
you
any
care
care
yes
plenty
of
it
does
he
not
go
roving
off
by
the
year
together
pretty
near
leaving
me
to
my
china
and
my
things
is
that
dutiful
i
do
say
frank
has
vexed
me
in
other
ways
he
has
good
parts
and
principles
he
does
not
play
up
old
gooseberry
as
some
young
men
do
ah
my
dear
if
he
and
you
could
but
have
made
it
out
together
you
would
not
have
scrupled
to
stay
at
heron
dyke
then
no
not
with
him
smiled
ella
it
would
have
been
his
own
so
to
say
we
must
not
think
of
that
no
use
to
think
of
it
my
young
gentleman
gave
me
to
understand
in
an
obscure
hint
or
two
that
he
had
been
setting
up
a
sweetheart
on
his
own
account
hoped
to
marry
her
sometime
when
i
asked
who
it
was
he
drew
in
and
said
no
more
save
that
i
should
know
all
in
good
time
then
he
would
not
have
had
me
laughed
ella
was
it
at
christmas
he
told
you
this
no
the
next
time
it
was
another
flying
visit
that
he
chose
to
pay
me
since
then
do
you
see
if
you
ca
make
up
to
that
young
kinswoman
of
ours
at
heron
dyke
i
said
to
him
and
he
had
the
impertinence
to
laugh
in
my
face
well
young
sir
said
i
this
much
that
if
you
take
up
with
any
black
foreign
woman
let
her
be
a
princess
if
you
like
i
not
countenance
your
marriage
it
was
not
a
black
princess
he
assured
me
so
i
make
no
doubt
it
is
some
silly
native
doll
ella
laughed
heartily
at
the
old
gentleman
genuine
tone
of
grievance
the
next
moment
she
blushed
crimson
at
the
sound
of
a
step
and
conroy
entered
the
room
he
stood
transfixed
with
surprise
the
in
his
hand
as
he
gazed
at
the
stranger
denison
rose
and
gazed
back
again
sir
exclaimed
conroy
what
brings
you
here
i
think
i
may
ask
what
brings
here
retorted
the
old
gentleman
while
ella
looked
on
in
wonder
have
you
no
welcome
for
me
conroy
advanced
and
put
his
hands
into
denison
his
face
lighting
up
with
smiles
ella
turned
to
her
lover
do
you
know
this
gentleman
edward
well
he
ought
to
he
is
my
own
son
interposed
denison
before
the
other
could
speak
a
graceless
young
fellow
always
giving
me
surprises
ella
winter
stood
bewildered
she
thought
a
farce
was
being
played
for
her
benefit
this
is
the
the
gentleman
i
told
you
of
sir
she
said
to
denison
his
name
is
conroy
indeed
my
dear
it
is
not
his
name
is
denison
dear
father
it
is
conroy
you
forget
said
the
young
man
with
a
laugh
ella
turning
to
her
my
name
is
francis
edward
conroy
denison
as
the
church
register
of
my
baptism
will
testify
just
you
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
master
frank
it
seems
that
you
do
know
your
young
kinswoman
here
yes
father
and
it
is
to
her
that
i
am
engaged
she
has
promised
to
be
my
wife
bless
my
heart
was
all
that
denison
could
ejaculate
conroy
well
yes
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
was
the
name
you
went
by
when
you
chose
to
go
gallivanting
about
the
world
as
a
newspaper
my
dear
you
are
looking
bewildered
and
no
wonder
i
am
bewildered
returned
ella
conroy
turned
to
address
her
my
father
brought
me
up
to
no
profession
he
began
he
thought
that
as
he
was
a
rich
man
there
was
no
necessity
for
me
to
learn
to
work
with
all
deference
to
him
i
chose
to
think
otherwise
idleness
was
distasteful
to
me
like
ulysses
i
could
not
bear
rest
unburnished
not
to
shine
in
use
i
wanted
to
taste
the
sweet
pride
of
earning
my
bread
by
the
labour
of
my
own
hands
i
dropped
my
family
name
and
went
out
into
the
world
with
what
result
you
know
you
made
no
such
mighty
splash
after
all
grunted
denison
i
contrived
to
be
of
some
use
sir
which
was
the
end
i
had
in
view
and
i
have
seen
the
world
and
gained
experience
i
shall
be
none
the
worse
for
it
in
the
father
and
not
much
the
better
i
dare
say
retorted
denison
my
dear
can
it
be
true
that
you
have
promised
to
marry
this
scapegrace
yes
smiled
ella
with
a
blush
very
good
we
hold
a
jubilee
but
how
was
it
pray
frank
that
you
kept
the
secret
from
me
is
that
your
idea
of
duty
father
i
will
explain
to
you
and
to
you
also
at
the
same
time
he
added
to
ella
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
this
young
lady
it
was
at
carlyon
i
fell
in
love
with
her
i
resolved
that
she
should
be
my
wife
good
providence
permitting
had
i
been
what
i
then
appeared
only
to
be
a
correspondent
for
the
newspapers
i
might
have
hesitated
to
cherish
any
such
hope
knowing
myself
to
be
the
probable
heir
of
heron
dyke
certainly
of
nunham
priors
i
felt
the
hope
was
justifiable
in
a
short
while
i
followed
her
down
here
and
got
admittance
to
the
hall
and
to
denison
under
the
plea
of
wishing
to
take
sketches
of
points
on
the
estate
my
incipient
love
for
miss
winter
grew
into
an
ardent
passion
and
i
felt
assured
as
to
the
future
moreover
i
saw
or
thought
i
saw
that
heron
dyke
would
never
come
to
her
but
to
you
there
was
that
in
the
squire
aspect
which
convinced
me
he
would
not
live
to
see
his
birthday
but
now
i
must
ask
you
father
to
acknowledge
what
your
course
would
have
been
had
i
told
you
this
should
you
not
have
hastened
to
open
negotiations
for
the
alliance
with
your
cousin
the
squire
dare
say
i
might
i
am
sure
of
it
and
that
would
have
ruined
all
the
squire
would
have
laid
his
positive
embargo
on
the
marriage
for
i
was
one
of
the
hated
denisons
and
he
would
have
extorted
a
promise
from
miss
winter
never
to
see
more
of
me
during
his
life
or
after
it
so
i
maintained
my
incognito
to
her
and
said
nothing
to
you
i
might
have
spoken
after
the
squire
death
that
true
enough
but
i
wanted
her
to
care
for
myself
alone
not
for
my
prospective
fortune
i
very
nearly
told
you
at
christmas
father
but
i
thought
i
would
wait
just
a
little
longer
last
week
i
went
down
to
nunham
priors
for
the
purpose
but
found
you
absent
i
intended
to
start
for
nunham
priors
again
expecting
you
would
by
that
time
be
at
home
he
should
take
out
a
licence
for
special
pleading
he
should
interjected
denison
to
ella
to
hear
the
neat
way
he
twists
and
turns
things
where
you
got
your
gift
o
the
gab
from
frank
do
know
not
from
me
frank
smiled
it
is
true
pleading
father
and
you
need
no
longer
be
under
the
fear
that
i
shall
bring
home
a
black
wife
there
some
sense
in
the
creature
yet
muttered
the
old
gentleman
with
a
flourish
of
his
ah
my
dear
what
can
i
say
to
him
in
what
terms
can
i
scold
him
when
he
proffers
you
to
me
as
his
excuse
i
can
only
forgive
him
yes
were
it
a
thousand
times
over
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
very
tenderly
you
shall
be
as
my
daughter
as
my

child
to

in
every
way

kinder
to

than
my
deserts

sure

to

longer

her
tears

with
wo
you
pleaded
the
grateful
girl
aunt
gertrude
is
here
you
know
wo
say
but
i
will
my
dear
i
should
like
to
see
a
bit
more
of
the
old
family
place
carlyon
surprise
when
she
came
into
the
room
and
saw
the
group
and
her
amazement
when
she
learnt
that
edward
conroy
the
despised
was
frank
denison
the
heir
may
well
be
left
to
the
imagination
aaron
stone
at
first
refused
to
believe
it
it
was
but
a
trick
o
them
other
denisons
he
muttered
and
it
did
not
soften
his
towards
conroy
other
troubles
were
not
done
with
yet
that
evening
after
dinner
and
never
had
a
happier
party
met
under
the
old
roof
than
was
then
assembled
when
the
ladies
went
into
the
ella
was
called
out
of
it
by
her
maid
adèle
to
be
told
that
the
household
was
in
a
commotion
two
of
the
maids
who
had
been
despatched
on
some
errand
to
miss
winter
in
the
north
wing
had
come
rushing
down
again
in
a
terrible
fright
asserting
that
the
ghost
of
katherine
keen
had
appeared
to
them
as
a
consequence
the
whole
of
the
servants
were
thoroughly
scared
ella
whispered
the
news
into
frank
denison
ear
that
night
before
he
left
for
his
quarters
at
the
rose
and
crown
but
it
would
take
her
some
time
yet
ere
she
could
remember
to
address
him
by
that
name
frank
made
light
of
it
to
ella
but
he
resolved
to
resume
his
patient
watchings
which
had
been
interrupted
of
late
and
his
patience
was
not
put
to
much
further
trial
the
following
evening
frank
as
we
must
now
call
him
instead
of
following
his
father
to
the
quietly
made
his
way
to
the
north
wing
he
saw
nothing
the
next
night
he
saw
nothing
heard
nothing
on
the
third
night
as
he
was
on
the
same
seat
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
gallery
that
he
was
sitting
on
once
before
when
he
heard
those
mysterious
words
spoken
the
origin
of
which
he
had
not
yet
been
able
to
fathom
he
was
startled
by
hearing
a
low
sigh
or
by
fancying
he
heard
it
no
great
distance
away
he
scarcely
dared
to
breathe
the
night
was
bright
with
stars
and
a
young
moon
and
frank
eyes
accustomed
to
the
fixed
themselves
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
seemed
to
have
come
next
moment
he
saw
a
dim
figure
emerge
from
the
blackness
of
the
corridor
beyond
and
advance
slowly
into
the
starlit
gallery
as
it
came
nearer
stepping
without
a
sound
he
could
see
that
it
was
robed
in
black
from
head
to
foot
he
could
see
its
white
face
and
one
white
hand
that
clasped
the
robe
closely
round
its
throat
frank
denison
was
no
coward
but
the
figure
gliding
noiselessly
towards
him
looked
so
eerie
and
unsubstantial
by
that
dim
light
that
if
his
heart
sank
a
little
it
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
if
he
strong
and
fearless
man
that
he
was
felt
thus
what
must
be
the
effect
of
such
an
apparition
on
the
nerves
of
timid
and
ignorant
girls
nearer
came
the
figure
and
nearer
it
would
have
passed
him
without
noticing
that
he
was
there
but
frank
nerved
himself
sprang
suddenly
forward
and
flinging
out
his
arms
seized
the
figure
firmly
round
the
waist
it
felt
tangible
enough
a
form
of
flesh
and
blood
without
doubt
he
had
half
expected
that
his
arms
would
grasp
nothing
but
thin
air
simultaneously
with
this
the
silence
of
the
north
wing
was
shattered
by
a
piercing
scream
and
the
figure
fell
into
frank
arms
that
scream
did
not
fail
to
make
itself
heard
below
two
minutes
later
scared
faces
with
as
many
lights
were
crowding
into
the
gallery
one
of
the
first
on
the
spot
was
miss
winter
she
stooped
and
gently
turned
the
face
that
was
resting
on
frank
arm
to
the
light
why
this
is
poor
susan
she
exclaimed
susan
keen
susan
keen
repeated
the
wondering
maids
pressing
round
carlyon
was
up
now
it
ca
be
susan
keen
what
should
susan
keen
do
here
she
cried
full
of
incredulity
it
is
susan
no
mistake
about
that
said
frank
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
try
and
restore
her
to
consciousness
the
girl
was
carried
to
miss
winter
and
placed
on
the
sofa
near
the
fire
the
same
sofa
that
maria
kettle
had
lain
on
when
she
got
her
fright
susan
soon
revived
and
they
gave
her
some
warm
wine
shutting
everybody
out
except
carlyon
ella
soothed
and
comforted
the
girl
with
pleasant
words
gradually
the
eyes
lost
their
frightened
look
and
the
poor
fluttering
heart
began
to
beat
more
equably
then
she
was
gently
questioned
and
little
by
little
without
much
pressing
susan
story
was
told
by
her
own
lips
possessed
by
the
belief
that
her
sister
either
alive
or
dead
was
hidden
somewhere
inside
the
hall
poor
susan
as
we
already
know
whenever
she
could
escape
her
mother
vigilance
took
to
wandering
about
the
grounds
in
the
dusk
of
evening
gazing
up
at
the
windows
of
the
old
house
more
especially
at
her
sister
bedroom
window
often
fancying
that
she
heard
katherine
voice
calling
her
and
trying
everywhere
to
find
some
traces
of
the
missing
girl
after
a
time
the
thought
seemed
to
have
entered
her
head
that
if
she
could
only
get
inside
the
hall
and
search
there
it
would
be
better
still
it
would
appear
that
on
two
occasions
during
katherine
service
there
when
susan
had
gone
up
to
the
hall
hoping
to
see
her
sister
aaron
stone
had
locked
up
for
the
night
susan
had
then
thrown
some
pieces
of
gravel
at
her
sister
window
in
order
to
attract
attention
upon
which
katherine
had
come
out
to
her
kissed
her
and
bidden
her
to
return
home
susan
curious
to
know
by
what
means
her
sister
had
been
able
to
leave
the
house
after
it
was
made
safe
for
the
night
had
persuaded
katherine
to
tell
her
among
other
rooms
on
the
at
the
back
of
the
hall
or
rather
at
its
side
and
the
side
not
frequented
was
one
that
was
called
the
in
which
logs
were
kept
to
dry
for
winter
burning
the
unglazed
window
of
this
room
was
protected
by
horizontal
iron
bars
and
one
day
by
a
mere
accident
katherine
saw
that
the
lowest
bar
was
loose
in
its
socket
it
could
be
displaced
and
replaced
at
will
and
there
was
not
the
smallest
difficulty
in
stepping
through
the
low
aperture
to
the
ground
outside
katherine
had
thought
it
no
harm
to
make
use
of
this
discovered
means
of
egress
on
the
one
or
two
occasions
she
had
seen
her
poor
simple
sister
waiting
rather
than
let
the
girl
remain
there
as
she
might
have
done
for
half
the
nights
when
the
loss
came
poor
susan
never
spoke
of
this
lest
it
might
bring
blame
on
katherine
memory
but
she
did
not
forget
it
and
when
impelled
by
uncontrollable
longing
to
discover
a
clue
to
her
sister
fate
and
to
venture
inside
the
house
she
sought
for
the
window
she
readily
found
it
she
had
but
to
displace
the
bar
step
in
and
be
within
the
hall
near
the
door
of
the
was
a
narrow
back
staircase
hardly
ever
used
which
led
up
to
the
north
wing
and
so
to
the
bedroom
which
katherine
had
occupied
susan
keen
might
be
but
she
was
cunning
in
this
search
as
she
had
found
a
way
of
getting
into
the
hall
so
she
found
a
way
of
getting
out
of
her
mother
house
after
she
was
supposed
to
be
safe
in
bed
she
would
creep
downstairs
open
one
of
the
lower
windows
go
out
of
it
and
return
in
the
same
way
mrs
keen
being
none
the
wiser
she
made
for
herself
a
pair
of
list
shoes
which
she
slipped
on
over
her
ordinary
walking
shoes
whenever
she
ventured
which
was
but
rarely
inside
the
hall
between
the
two
sisters
there
was
a
strong
family
likeness
both
had
the
same
long
pale
serious
face
the
same
large
grey
eyes
and
hair
of
the
same
tint
a
dark
brown
with
a
gleam
of
gold
in
it
in
the
dusk
of
evening
or
by
the
dim
light
of
a
candle
in
a
big
room
it
was
quite
possible
that
one
sister
should
be
mistaken
for
the
other
even
by
those
to
whom
both
of
them
were
well
known
susan
it
was
whom
the
two
maids
ann
and
martha
had
seen
looking
down
upon
them
from
the
gallery
she
it
was
who
had
frightened
carlyon
and
deceived
maria
kettle
it
was
her
voice
that
conroy
had
heard
calling
for
her
sister
as
she
wandered
through
the
dark
passages
of
the
north
wing
it
was
she
who
had
tried
betsy
door
the
night
of
the
storm
and
it
was
no
other
than
she
who
had
rearranged
the
furniture
in
katherine
abandoned
chamber
about
which
there
had
been
so
much
speculation
the
supposed
ghost
haunting
the
north
wing
had
not
been
a
ghost
after
all
instead
of
being
katherine
dead
it
was
susan
living
but
she
will
not
come
to
me
though
i
seek
for
her
everywhere
wailed
poor
susan
as
she
came
to
the
end
of
her
narrative
and
looked
piteously
into
the
compassionate
face
of
miss
winter
oh
where
can
she
be
living
or
dead
she
be
inside
these
walls
i
hear
her
voice
calling
to
me
but
i
can
never
find
her
where
can
she
be
where
can
she
be
it
was
a
question
that
miss
winter
could
not
answer
chapter
xiii
the
last
mystery
solved
it
not
a
bit
of
use
your
making
any
objection
my
dear
i
set
my
mind
on
it
and
i
mean
to
do
it
why
should
you
wait
till
i
dead
i
may
live
for
a
dozen
years
to
come
and
the
income
will
be
of
far
more
use
to
you
now
when
you
are
setting
up
housekeeping
than
it
would
be
later
the
speaker
was
lady
maria
skeffington
and
the
person
to
whom
she
was
laying
down
the
law
in
this
peremptory
fashion
was
her
maria
kettle
or
rather
cleeve
maria
and
philip
had
moved
into
a
pretty
little
house
near
homedale
they
were
furnishing
it
and
beginning
life
on
their
own
account
maria
had
a
large
apron
on
and
her
turned
up
at
the
wrists
she
was
making
herself
as
busy
as
a
bee
this
morning
with
her
two
when
interrupted
by
her
godmother
lady
maria
sat
down
on
the
sofa
causing
maria
to
sit
by
her
side
and
began
to
talk
after
a
little
gossip
touching
the
sayings
and
doings
of
the
neighbourhood
she
went
on
to
tell
maria
that
she
had
always
intended
to
bequeath
to
her
two
thousand
pounds
at
her
death
but
that
as
maria
was
now
married
and
help
would
be
useful
to
her
and
her
husband
she
had
decided
to
make
over
that
sum
to
her
without
delay
it
was
well
and
safely
invested
and
would
bring
in
one
hundred
pounds
yearly
secured
to
maria
herself
overpowered
by
the
unexpected
kindness
maria
remonstrated
it
was
too
much
she
said
and
why
should
lady
maria
deprive
herself
of
this
much
yearly
income
before
her
death
not
another
word
child
if
you
love
me
do
i
tell
you
i
have
already
decided
after
that
argument
is
useless
a
mere
waste
of
breath
maria
knew
of
old
that
when
once
her
godmother
had
made
up
her
mind
to
any
particular
course
nothing
could
move
her
from
it
in
such
a
case
submission
was
the
only
policy
she
turned
and
kissed
her
you
are
far
kinder
to
me
than
i
deserve
dear
lady
maria
philip
will
scarcely
know
how
to
thank
you
sufficiently
philip
is
not
so
as
you
rejoined
her
ladyship
drily
he
knows
the
value
of
money
he
would
never
think
of
refusing
such
a
gift
maria
said
nothing
but
she
smiled
to
herself
to
hear
philip
spoken
of
as
one
who
knew
so
well
the
value
of
money
though
indeed
his
late
experiences
had
perhaps
taught
it
him
and
now
my
dear
i
want
you
to
put
on
your
bonnet
and
accompany
me
to
the
hall
continued
lady
maria
my
barouche
is
at
the
door
and
i
am
going
to
call
there
the
drive
will
do
you
good
this
bright
brisk
morning
the
young
wife
would
rather
have
been
left
to
the
arrangement
of
her
household
gods
but
she
could
not
refuse
her
godmother
especially
at
the
moment
when
she
had
been
so
generous
to
her
so
she
made
herself
ready
and
they
were
soon
bowling
along
the
road
to
heron
dyke
lady
maria
was
still
full
of
the
marvellous
revelation
that
edward
conroy
was
edward
denison
though
some
two
or
three
weeks
had
elapsed
since
the
fact
became
known
abroad
i
was
talking
to
downes
about
it
yesterday
my
dear
he
agreed
with
me
that
it
was
like
one
of
those
romances
one
gets
out
of
the
library
what
a
good
thing
it
is
that
the
young
man
is
so
charming
and
indeed
i
think
we
might
all
have
seen
something
in
him
above
an
ordinary
newspaper
reporter
it
is
a
romance
agreed
maria
and
a
very
delightful
one
have
you
seen
mr
denison
i
saw
him
when
i
was
at
the
hall
the
other
day
a
charmingly
quaint
old
man
who
put
me
so
much
in
mind
of
the
late
squire
and
my
dear
added
lady
maria
lowering
her
voice
lest
the
servants
on
the
box
in
front
of
her
should
hear
what
do
you
think
downes
told
me
that
the
ghost
which
has
been
supposed
to
be
haunting
the
north
wing
has
turned
out
to
be
crazy
susan
keen
it
is
so
answered
maria
the
poor
girl
has
been
in
the
habit
of
creeping
into
the
hall
at
night
to
look
for
her
sister
the
doctor
tells
me
the
appearances
that
were
set
down
to
the
dead
girl
the
mysterious
noises
and
all
the
rest
of
it
have
been
traced
to
her
susan
confessed
it
voluntarily
remarked
maria
it
is
a
sad
thing
though
of
course
it
is
well
that
it
should
have
been
discovered
well
maria
what
i
should
do
with
the
girl
is
this
put
her
into
an
asylum
downes
agreed
with
me
that
many
a
one
has
been
confined
for
less
cause
though
he
thinks
there
will
be
no
further
trouble
of
this
sort
with
her
in
future
never
again
in
future
said
maria
shaking
her
head
her
mother
will
take
right
good
care
of
her
she
has
had
a
little
bed
put
up
for
her
beside
her
own
and
does
not
trust
her
out
of
her
sight
here
we
are
cried
lady
maria
as
the
coachman
drove
into
heron
dyke
what
a
commotion
the
place
seems
in
what
can
be
going
on
i
wonder
denison
found
himself
so
comfortable
under
the
old
family
that
he
let
nunham
priors
take
care
of
itself
for
a
while
and
stayed
on
before
a
week
had
gone
over
his
head
he
was
projecting
no
end
of
improvements
this
must
be
done
and
the
other
must
be
done
some
for
embellishment
some
for
use
and
all
of
course
for
the
convenience
and
benefit
of
his
son
and
who
would
inhabit
the
place
energetic
as
ever
was
the
old
squire
when
once
he
took
a
thing
into
his
head
denison
was
not
content
with
projecting
he
set
about
doing
calling
tiplady
to
his
counsels
and
after
him
a
clever
builder
of
reputation
the
alterations
were
begun
forthwith
heron
dyke
was
of
course
his
own
and
he
could
do
what
he
would
the
new
conservatory
recently
built
by
miss
winter
was
all
very
well
but
not
large
enough
it
was
to
be
considerably
lengthened
and
widened
i
do
like
walking
down
a
greenhouse
my
dear
where
the
space
allowed
for
the
paths
is
so
narrow
one
must
brush
the
plants
on
either
side
he
remarked
to
ella
the
kitchens
and
some
other
portions
of
the
domestic
offices
must
be
rendered
more
commodious
in
accordance
with
modern
requirements
a
new
road
was
to
be
driven
through
the
shrubbery
and
the
old
narrow
inconvenient
road
rarely
used
on
the
side
of
the
house
blocked
up
and
planted
over
on
the
morning
that
was
to
witness
the
call
at
the
hall
of
lady
maria
skeffington
and
philip
wife
the
workmen
were
busy
with
this
work
when
frank
denison
came
hastily
into
the
room
where
his
father
sat
talking
to
ella
carlyon
and
toynbee
frank
countenance
wore
a
startled
expression
and
he
looked
grave
and
pale
ella
thoughts
flew
to
the
men
she
feared
some
accident
had
happened
what
is
it
she
cried
rising
from
her
seat
are
any
of
the
men
hurt
no
no
the
men
are
all
right
he
answered
then
after
a
pause
he
held
something
out
to
ella
do
you
chance
to
know
this
he
asked
can
you
tell
to
whom
it
belonged
it
was
a
small
gold
locket
dented
in
on
one
side
and
much
discoloured
as
if
it
had
lain
for
some
time
in
a
damp
place
ella
recognised
it
with
staring
eyes
and
began
to
tremble
with
a
fear
she
did
not
wait
to
define
this
was
katherine
keen
it
was
my
present
to
her
on
her
birthday
and
she
had
it
on
the
night
she
was
lost
oh
edward
where
did
you
find
it
i
fear
he
replied
that
we
have
found
found
her
katherine
carlyon
put
ella
back
with
her
hand
sit
down
my
love
she
said
frank
turning
to
him
do
you
say
you
have
found
katherine
keen
i
believe
so
it
can
be
no
other
dead
oh
yes
poor
girl
but
where
in
that
old
well
just
beyond
the
the
men
have
been
uncovering
the
well
this
morning
and
and
they
have
found
some
one
lying
in
it
she
had
this
locket
round
her
neck
ella
sat
down
white
and
silent
and
hid
her
face
amid
the
denison
caught
up
his
stick
and
hurried
out
the
news
had
already
got
wind
people
were
running
to
the
spot
and
it
was
just
then
that
lady
maria
carriage
drove
in
they
had
indeed
found
poor
katherine
keen
we
must
trace
back
to
the
time
of
katherine
disappearance
this
old
well
situated
not
far
from
the
door
of
the
had
supplied
the
hall
with
water
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
but
at
length
for
some
unknown
cause
the
spring
had
begun
to
fail
the
water
in
the
well
gradually
becoming
lower
until
what
was
left
lay
so
deep
down
that
it
was
not
worth
the
labour
of
drawing
up
after
that
the
old
well
was
left
to
itself
for
several
years
the
woodwork
above
it
decaying
and
rotting
slowly
in
summer
sun
and
winter
rain
it
lay
as
has
been
said
on
the
unfrequented
side
of
the
house
i
have
this
altered
said
the
squire
one
day
as
he
chanced
to
pass
that
way
and
stood
to
look
at
it
and
he
at
once
gave
orders
that
the
woodwork
should
be
removed
and
the
well
filled
up
his
wishes
were
not
long
in
being
carried
out
the
old
woodwork
disappeared
a
quantity
of
earth
and
rubbish
was
collected
to
be
shot
into
the
well
and
a
large
big
enough
to
cover
the
whole
of
the
orifice
was
brought
to
the
spot
the
work
was
in
progress
one
february
afternoon
when
the
snow
began
to
come
down
thick
and
fast
which
caused
the
men
to
cease
working
until
the
morning
only
a
portion
of
the
rubbish
being
then
shot
in
except
the
actual
fact
of
the
catastrophe
itself
what
else
happened
on
that
fatal
night
could
only
be
matter
of
conjecture
the
inference
was
that
katherine
on
reaching
her
bedroom
and
beginning
to
undress
lifted
up
a
corner
of
the
blind
and
peering
out
saw
her
sister
standing
below
gazing
up
at
the
window
a
dark
figure
outlined
against
a
snowy
background
the
snow
by
this
time
had
ceased
to
fall
and
a
bright
moon
was
struggling
through
the
broken
clouds
katherine
must
then
have
hurried
downstairs
with
the
intention
of
seeing
her
sister
and
sending
her
back
home
although
the
house
was
being
locked
up
she
would
get
out
easily
and
unseen
by
the
window
replacing
the
loose
bar
as
a
matter
of
precaution
this
done
she
no
doubt
ran
round
by
this
unfrequented
way
where
the
well
was
and
fell
headlong
into
it
the
two
screams
heard
one
loud
the
other
fainter
escaping
her
in
the
act
of
falling
whether
she
cried
out
afterwards
and
there
was
no
one
to
hear
or
whether
she
fell
senseless
or
whether
she
was
killed
at
once
must
remain
matter
of
supposition
after
that
so
far
as
was
known
all
was
silence
early
next
morning
came
the
workmen
more
snow
had
fallen
in
the
night
erasing
all
footprints
of
the
previous
evening
covering
the
bottom
of
the
well
with
a
white
surface
the
men
made
sharp
haste
to
finish
their
task
knowing
and
suspecting
nothing
and
fate
had
remained
undiscovered
until
now
aaron
habitual
crustiness
had
something
to
do
with
the
nondiscovery
chancing
to
meet
the
men
as
they
quitted
the
work
before
time
that
evening
he
sourly
demanded
whether
the
work
was
accomplished
and
the
well
filled
up
afraid
of
him
not
caring
to
incur
his
stinging
reprimands
both
the
men
answered
that
it
was
quite
finished
therefore
aaron
never
gave
a
thought
to
the
well
in
regard
to
katherine
disappearance
and
as
for
the
squire
himself
and
the
rest
of
the
household
they
did
not
so
much
as
know
that
the
work
was
just
then
about
while
the
fact
of
its
being
impossible
or
assumed
to
be
that
katherine
could
by
any
manner
of
means
have
got
out
of
the
house
served
yet
more
to
divert
thoughts
from
the
truth
and
the
two
workmen
deceived
by
the
white
surface
inside
on
which
they
had
both
looked
down
in
the
morning
never
then
or
later
supposed
the
well
could
have
anything
to
do
with
the
girl
disappearance
thus
the
last
and
longest
mystery
was
solved
such
had
been
poor
katherine
unhappy
fate
susan
would
never
more
wander
in
the
park
after
nightfall
or
within
the
hall
to
look
for
her
she
would
never
hear
her
sister
voice
calling
to
her
again
never
fancy
that
the
moonlight
playing
upon
the
window
of
katherine
room
was
her
apparition
standing
there
the
wedding
was
a
very
quiet
one
without
show
or
parade
ella
winter
became
the
wife
of
that
erratic
gentleman
francis
edward
conroy
denison
the
indisputable
heir
of
heron
dyke
old
denison
insisted
upon
giving
the
bride
away
and
a
hamper
of
his
choicest
china
arrived
from
nunham
priors
to
deck
the
lady
maria
nephew
the
young
earl
of
skeffington
had
asked
leave
to
be
the
best
man
aaron
stood
behind
his
mistress
chair
at
breakfast
to
deny
him
this
privilege
would
have
broken
his
heart
but
it
was
the
last
service
he
would
render
at
the
hall
he
and
his
wife
were
about
to
retire
to
a
pretty
little
cottage
near
the
leaning
gate
denison
at
wish
had
given
it
to
them
for
life
and
she
had
furnished
it
frank
and
his
bride
now
denison
as
her
uncle
had
always
wished
her
name
to
be
started
on
their
way
to
the
continent
during
their
absence
which
might
extend
to
two
or
three
months
the
alterations
at
heron
dyke
would
be
completed
and
their
establishment
put
upon
a
proper
footing
what
more
is
there
to
tell
all
are
left
happy
the
years
go
round
and
as
yet
no
sorrow
falls
the
young
squire
as
frank
denison
is
now
called
is
in
parliament
so
that
he
and
his
wife
are
much
in
london
during
the
earlier
portion
of
the
year
denison
travels
often
from
nunham
priors
to
stay
at
heron
dyke
where
his
pleasantest
days
are
passed
when
ella
baby
came
he
was
a
little
grumpy
in
his
comical
way
at
its
being
a
girl
instead
of
the
boy
he
had
expected
though
he
acknowledges
that
it
is
not
impossible
the
boy
may
put
in
an
appearance
later
much
unity
friendship
and
intimacy
exist
between
ella
and
her
husband
and
the
cleeves
philip
is
so
steady
as
to
justify
his
mother
fond
opinion
of
him
his
talents
for
business
and
his
application
to
it
surprise
even
tiplady
while
his
laugh
is
as
genial
and
his
manners
are
sunny
and
pleasant
as
ever
little
freddy
bootle
often
runs
down
to
see
them
and
is
ever
a
welcome
guest
at
the
hall
carlyon
comes
sometimes
and
the
baby
bears
her
name
gertrude
even
old
aaron
is
tolerably
happy
for
he
can
grumble
to
his
content
he
could
not
cease
from
doing
that
partly
at
dorothy
though
she
does
not
mind
it
partly
at
his
friends
in
general
he
is
a
great
man
of
an
evening
in
the
sanded
parlour
of
the
leaning
gate
or
the
fisherman
arms
a
special
chair
is
placed
for
him
and
he
between
the
intervals
of
growling
at
the
world
tells
anecdotes
of
forty
years
ago
to
the
deferential
company
smoking
around
mrs
keen
active
as
of
yore
is
assisted
in
her
duties
by
susan
time
has
laid
its
healing
hand
upon
their
sorrows
poor
susan
will
never
be
quite
bright
and
that
look
is
sometimes
to
be
seen
on
her
face
still
but
no
or
more
gentle
girl
is
to
be
met
anywhere
and
now
that
the
mystery
of
her
sister
fate
no
longer
weighs
upon
her
brain
there
is
a
sort
of
peacefulness
and
soft
serenity
about
her
which
are
very
attractive
her
greatest
treat
is
to
go
up
to
the
hall
and
see
the
baby
little
gertrude
and
the
nurses
avow
that
that
youthful
tyrant
is
never
so
much
on
her
good
behaviour
as
when
allowed
to
rest
for
a
few
minutes
in
susan
loving
arms
but
as
soon
as
ever
daylight
begins
to
die
in
the
woods
round
heron
dyke
when
the
long
corridors
of
the
old
house
grow
dim
and
the
wide
staircases
become
the
homes
of
shadow
and
mystery
then
does
susan
resolutely
set
her
face
homeward
she
who
used
to
haunt
the
hall
after
nightfall
when
trying
to
find
the
katherine
will
not
go
near
it

in
broadest
