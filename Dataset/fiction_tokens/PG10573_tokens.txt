fine
feathers
jobson
awoke
with
a
sundayish
feeling
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
bank
holiday
he
had
been
aware
in
a
dim
fashion
of
the
rising
of
jobson
some
time
before
and
in
a
condition
had
taken
over
a
large
slice
of
unoccupied
territory
he
stretched
himself
and
yawned
and
then
by
an
effort
of
will
threw
off
the
clothes
and
springing
out
of
bed
reached
for
his
trousers
he
was
an
orderly
man
and
had
hung
them
every
night
for
over
twenty
years
on
the
brass
knob
on
his
side
of
the
bed
he
had
hung
them
there
the
night
before
and
now
they
had
absconded
with
a
pair
of
red
braces
just
entering
their
teens
instead
on
a
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
a
collection
of
garments
that
made
him
shudder
with
trembling
fingers
he
turned
over
a
black
tailcoat
a
white
waistcoat
and
a
pair
of
light
check
trousers
a
white
shirt
a
collar
and
tie
kept
them
company
and
greatest
outrage
of
all
a
tall
silk
hat
stood
on
its
own
beside
the
chair
jobson
fingering
his
bristly
chin
stood
regarding
the
collection
with
a
wan
smile
that
their
little
game
is
it
he
muttered
to
make
a
toff
of
me
where
my
clothes
got
to
i
wonder
a
hasty
search
satisfied
him
that
they
were
not
in
the
room
and
pausing
only
to
drape
himself
in
the
counterpane
he
made
his
way
into
the
next
he
passed
on
to
the
others
and
then
with
a
growing
sense
of
alarm
stole
softly
downstairs
and
making
his
way
to
the
shop
continued
the
search
with
the
shutters
up
the
place
was
almost
in
darkness
and
in
spite
of
his
utmost
care
apples
and
potatoes
rolled
on
to
the
floor
and
travelled
across
it
in
a
succession
of
bumps
then
a
sudden
turn
brought
the
scales
clattering
down
gracious
alf
said
a
voice
are
you
of
jobson
turned
and
eyed
his
wife
who
was
standing
at
the
door
looking
for
my
clothes
mother
he
replied
briefly
said
jobson
with
an
obvious
attempt
at
unconcerned
speech
why
they
on
the
mean
clothes
fit
for
a
christian
to
wear
fit
for
a
greengrocer
to
wear
said
jobson
raising
his
voice
was
a
little
surprise
for
you

his
wife

bert

gladys
and
dorothy

jobson
feebly
but

doing
without

his
wife
for
gladys
i
sure

knows
what
she

jobson
i

with

she
is
alf
alf
i
surprised
at
you
jobson
coughed
the
collar
mother
he
said
at
last
ai
wore
a
collar
for
over
twenty
years
not
since
we
was
walking
out
together
and
then
i
did
like
shame
for
you
said
his
wife
sure
there
no
other
respectable
tradesman
goes
about
with
a
handkerchief
knotted
round
his
their
skins
ai
as
tender
as
what
mine
is
urged
jobson
besides
fancy
me
in
a
why
i
shall
be
the
of
the
said
his
wife
only
the
lower
classes
what
would
laugh
and
nobody
minds
what
they
jobson
sighed
i
shall
to
go
back
to
bed
again
then
he
said
ruefully
long
mother
hope
you
have
a
pleasant
time
at
the
he
took
a
reef
in
the
counterpane
and
with
a
fair
amount
of
dignity
considering
his
appearance
stalked
upstairs
again
and
stood
gloomily
considering
affairs
in
his
bedroom
ever
since
gladys
and
dorothy
had
been
big
enough
to
be
objects
of
interest
to
the
young
men
of
the
neighbourhood
the
clothes
nuisance
had
been
rampant
he
peeped
through
the
at
the
bright
sunshine
outside
and
then
looked
back
at
the
tumbled
bed
a
murmur
of
voices
downstairs
apprised
him
that
the
conspirators
were
awaiting
the
result
he
dressed
at
last
and
stood
like
a
lamb
a
redfaced
lamb
while
jobson
fastened
his
collar
for
him
wanted
to
get
a
taller
one
she
remarked
i
said
this
would
do
to
begin
it
to
come
over
my
mouth
i
said
the
unfortunate
jobson
it
your
own
way
do
mind
about
me
what
with
the
trousers
and
the
collar
i
could
pick
up
a
sovereign
if
i
saw
one
in
front
of
you
see
one
i
pick
it
up
for
you
said
his
wife
taking
up
the
hat
and
moving
towards
the
door
along
jobson
with
his
arms
standing
out
stiffly
from
his
sides
and
his
head
painfully
erect
followed
her
downstairs
and
a
sudden
hush
as
he
entered
the
kitchen
testified
to
the
effect
produced
by
his
appearance
it
was
followed
by
a
hum
of
admiration
that
sent
the
blood
flying
to
his
head
he
could
have
done
it
before
i
do
know
said
the
dutiful
gladys
there
ai
a
man
in
the
street
looks
a
quarter
as
him
like
a
glove
said
dorothy
walking
round
him
the
right
length
said
bert
scrutinizing
the
coat
he
stands
as
straight
as
a
soldier
said
gladys
clasping
her
hands
gleefully
said
jobson
briefly
i
it
took
off
while
i
eat
my
bloater
mother
be
silly
alf
said
his
wife
pour
your
father
out
a
nice
strong
pot
cup
o
tea
and
do
forget
that
the
train
starts
at
ha
past

all
right
when
it
sees
me
observed
jobson
squinting
down
at
his
trousers
mother
and
children
delighted
with
the
success
of
their
scheme
laughed
applause
and
jobson
somewhat
gratified
at
the
success
of
his
retort
sat
down
and
attacked
his
breakfast
a
short
clay
pipe
smoked
as
a
digestive
was
impounded
by
the
watchful
jobson
the
moment
he
had
finished
it
smoke
it
along
the
street
if
i
did
she
declared
why
not
demanded
her
husband
in
a
said
jobson
shaking
her
head
at
him
a
said
dorothy
would
spoil
the
other
said
gladys
wish
something
would
spoil
the
hat
said
jobson
wistfully
no
good
i
must
smoke
jobson
smiled
and
going
to
the
cupboard
produced
with
a
smile
of
triumph
an
envelope
containing
seven
cigars
jobson
whistled
and
taking
one
up
examined
it
carefully
do
they
call
mother
he
inquired
and
try
again
smokes
jobson
smiled
vaguely
and
the
girls
are
going
upstairs
to
get
ready
now
she
said
your
eye
on
him
bert
father
and
son
grinned
at
each
other
and
to
pass
the
time
took
a
cigar
apiece
they
had
just
finished
them
when
a
swish
and
rustle
of
skirts
sounded
from
the
stairs
and
jobson
and
the
girls
beautifully
attired
entered
the
room
and
stood
buttoning
their
gloves
a
strong
smell
of
scent
fought
with
the
aroma
of
the
cigars
get
round
me
like
so
as
to
hide
me
a
bit
entreated
jobson
as
they
quitted
the
house
do
mind
so
much
when
we
get
out
of
our
jobson
laughed
his
fears
to
scorn
cross
the
road
then
said
jobson
urgently
bill
foley
standing
at
his
his
wife
sniffed
him
stand
she
said
haughtily
foley
failed
to
avail
himself
of
the
permission
he
regarded
jobson
with
dilated
eyeballs
and
as
the
party
approached
sank
slowly
into
a
sitting
position
on
his
doorstep
and
as
the
door
opened
behind
him
rolled
slowly
over
onto
his
back
and
presented
an
enormous
pair
of
hobnailed
soles
to
the
gaze
of
an
interested
world
told
you
it
would
be
said
the
blushing
jobson
know
what
bill
like
as
well
as
i
his
wife
tossed
her
head
and
they
all
quickened
their
pace
the
voice
of
the
ingenious
foley
calling
piteously
for
his
mother
pursued
them
to
the
end
of
the
road
knew
what
it
be
said
jobson
wiping
his
hot
face
will
never
let
me
the
end
of
said
his
wife
bridling
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
got
to
ask
bill
foley
you
to
dress
he
soon
get
tired
of
it
and
besides
it
just
as
well
to
let
him
see
who
you
are
there
not
many
tradesmen
as
would
lower
themselves
by
mixing
with
a
jobson
scratched
his
ear
but
wisely
refrained
from
speech
once
clear
of
his
own
district
mental
agitation
subsided
but
bodily
discomfort
increased
at
every
step
the
hat
and
the
collar
bothered
him
most
but
every
article
of
attire
contributed
its
share
his
uneasiness
was
so
manifest
that
jobson
after
a
little
womanly
sympathy
suggested
that
besides
sundays
it
might
be
as
well
to
wear
them
occasionally
of
an
evening
in
order
to
get
used
to
them
i
got
to
wear
them
every
sunday
demanded
the
unfortunate
blankly
i
thought
they
was
only
for
bank
jobson
told
him
not
to
be
silly
i
did
said
her
husband
earnestly
no
idea
suffering
i
got
a
headache
i
arf
choked
and
there
a
feeling
about
my
waist
as
though
i
being
cuddled
by
somebody
i
do
jobson
said
it
would
soon
wear
off
and
seated
in
the
train
that
bore
them
to
the
crystal
palace
put
the
hat
on
the
rack
her
attempt
to
leave
it
in
the
train
was
easily
frustrated
and
his
explanation
that
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
received
in
silence
it
was
evident
that
he
would
require
watching
and
under
the
clear
gaze
of
his
children
he
seldom
had
a
button
undone
for
more
than
three
minutes
at
a
time
the
day
was
hot
and
he
perspired
profusely
his
collar
lost
its
starch
a
thing
to
be
grateful
for
and
for
the
greater
part
of
the
day
he
wore
his
tie
under
the
left
ear
by
the
time
they
had
arrived
home
again
he
was
in
a
state
of
open
mutiny
again
he
said
loudly
as
he
tore
the
collar
off
and
hung
his
coat
on
a
chair
there
was
a
chorus
of
lamentation
but
he
remained
firm
dorothy
began
to
sniff
ominously
and
gladys
spoke
longingly
of
the
fathers
possessed
by
other
girls
it
was
not
until
jobson
sat
eyeing
her
supper
instead
of
eating
it
that
he
began
to
temporize
he
gave
way
bit
by
bit
garment
by
garment
when
he
gave
way
at
last
on
the
great
hat
question
his
wife
took
up
her
knife
and
fork
his
workaday
clothes
appeared
in
his
bedroom
next
morning
but
the
others
still
remained
in
the
clutches
of
aunt
emma
the
suit
provided
was
of
considerable
antiquity
and
at
closing
time
jobson
after
some
hesitation
donned
his
new
clothes
and
with
a
sheepish
glance
at
his
wife
went
out
jobson
nodded
delight
at
her
daughters
coming
round
she
whispered
liked
that
calling
him
yesterday
i
noticed
it
he
put
on
everything
but
the
topper
do
say
nothing
about
it
take
it
as
a
matter
of
it
became
evident
as
the
days
wore
on
that
she
was
right
bit
by
bit
she
obtained
the
other
clothes
with
some
difficulty
from
aunt
emma
but
her
husband
still
wore
his
best
on
sundays
and
sometimes
of
an
evening
and
twice
on
going
into
the
bedroom
suddenly
she
had
caught
him
surveying
himself
at
different
angles
in
the
glass
and
moreover
he
had
spoken
with
some
heat
for
such
a
man
on
the
shortcomings
of
dorothy
laundry
work
better
put
your
collars
out
said
his
wife
the
shirts
said
jobson
looks
worse
than
a
bad

quite
dressy
said
his
wife
with
a
laugh
jobson
eyed
her
seriously
mother

replied
i

as

yesterday
i
bought
a
book

the
delighted
jobson
jobson
was
glad
to
find
that
her
opinion
on
his
purchase
was
shared
by
the
rest
of
the
family
encouraged
by
their
approval
he
told
them
of
the
benefit
he
was
deriving
from
it
and
at
that
day
after
a
little
hesitation
ventured
to
affirm
that
it
was
a
book
that
might
do
them
all
good
hear
said
gladys
one
thing
said
jobson
slowly
did
know
before

saucer
the
book
says
it

thing
that

mouth

bert
jobson
drained

saucer
thoughtfully
your
teeth

poured
the

after
eyeing
it
thoughtfully
for
some
time
agitated
the
surface
with
his
right
foot
he
dipped
and
dried
that
much
enduring
member
some
ten
times
and
after
regarding
the
damp
condition
of
the

great
satisfaction

your
fingers

and
eyed
her
mother
appealingly
one
hundred
and
something
i
think
it
is
said
her
father
with
his
mouth
full
at
the
dinner
table
it
near
the
end
of
the
book
i
i
never
do
no
worse
than
that
i
sha
come
to
no
harm
said
his
daughter
jobson
shook
his
head
at
her
and
after
eating
his
breakfast
with
great
care
wiped
his
mouth
on
his
handkerchief
and
went
into
the
shop
suppose
it
all
right
said
jobson
looking
after
him
he
taking
it
very
serious
washed
his
hands
five
times
yesterday
morning
said
dorothy
who
had
just
come
in
from
the
shop
to
her
breakfast
kept
customers
waiting
while
he
did
it
the
business
i
ca
get
over
said
her
mother
sure
it
more
trouble
to
empty
them
than
what
it
is
to
fill
them
there
quite
enough
work
in
the
as
it
much
said
bert
with
unwonted
consideration
wish
he
leave
me
alone
said
gladys
food
do
do
me
no
good
when
he
watching
every
mouthful
i
of
murmurings
such
as
these
jobson
heard
nothing
and
in
view
of
the
great
improvement
in
his
dress
and
manners
a
strong
resolution
was
passed
to
avoid
the
faintest
appearance
of
discontent
even
when
satisfied
with
his
own
appearance
he
set
to
work
to
improve
that
of
jobson
that
admirable
woman
made
no
complaint
hitherto
the
brightness
of
her
attire
and
the
size
of
her
hats
had
been
held
to
atone
for
her
lack
of
figure
and
the
roomy
comfort
of
her
boots
but
jobson
infected
with
new
ideas
refused
to
listen
to
such
sophistry
he
went
shopping
with
dorothy
and
the
sunday
after
when
jobson
went
for
an
airing
with
him
she
walked
in
boots
with
heels
two
inches
high
and
toes
that
ended
in
a
point
a
waist
that
had
disappeared
some
years
before
was
recaptured
and
placed
in
durance
vile
and
a
hat
which
called
for
a
new
style
of
completed
the
effect
look
splendid
ma
said
gladys
as
she
watched
their
departure
do
feel
splendid
sighed
jobson
to
her
husband
boots
feel
usual
size
said
jobson
looking
across
the
road
the
clothes
seem
just
a
bit
tight
continued
his
wife
jobson
regarded
her
critically
they
might
have
been
let
out
a
quarter
of
an
inch
he
said
thoughtfully
the
best
fit
you
for
a
long
time
mother
i
only
the
gals
such
good
his
wife
smiled
faintly
but
with
little
breath
for
conversation
walked
on
for
some
time
in
silence
a
growing
redness
of
face
testified
to
her
distress
i
feel
awful
she
said
at
last
pressing
her
hand
to
her
side
soon
get
used
to
it
said
jobson
gently
at
me
i
felt
like
you
do
at
first
and
now
i
would
go
back
to
old
clothes
and
comfort
for
anything
you
get
to
love
them
boots
i
could
only
take
off
i
should
love
better
said
his
wife
panting
i
ca
breathe
properly
i
ca
look
ripping
mother
said
her
husband
simply
his
wife
essayed
another
smile
but
failed
she
set
her
lips
together
and
plodded
on
jobson
chatting
cheerily
and
taking
no
notice
of
the
fact
that
she
kept
lurching
against
him
two
miles
from
home
she
stopped
and
eyed
him
fixedly
i
do
get
these
boots
off
alf
i
shall
be
a
cripple
for
the
rest
of
my
days
she
murmured
ankle
gone
over
three
you

take
off
here
said
jobson
hastily
it
would
must
a
cab
or
something
said
his
wife
hysterically
i
do
get
off
soon
i
shall
she
leaned
against
the
iron
palings
of
a
house
for
support
while
jobson
standing
on
the
kerb
looked
up
and
down
the
road
for
a
cab
a
appeared
just
in
time
to
prevent
the
scandal
of
jobson
removing
her
boots
in
the
street
goodness
she
gasped
as
she
climbed
in
mind
about
untying
alf
cut
the
laces
and
get
off
they
drove
home
with
the
boots
standing
side
by
side
on
the
seat
in
front
of
them
jobson
got
out
first
and
knocked
at
the
door
and
as
soon
as
it
opened
jobson
pattered
across
the
intervening
space
with
the
boots
dangling
from
her
hand
she
had
nearly
reached
the
door
when
foley
who
had
a
diabolical
habit
of
always
being
on
hand
when
he
was
least
wanted
appeared
suddenly
from
the
offside
of
the
cab
paddlin
he
inquired
jobson
safe
in
her
doorway
drew
herself
up
and
holding
the
boots
behind
her
surveyed
him
with
a
stare
of
disdain
paddlin
he
inquired
see
you
going
down
the
road
in
said
the
unabashed
foley
i
says
to
myself
i
says

pinch
but
she
going
too
far
if
she
thinks
that
she
can
squeedge
those
little
tootsywootsies
of
into
them
boo
the
door
slammed
violently
and
left
him
exchanging
grins
with
jobson
the
he
inquired
jobson
winked
you
a
level
i
ai
wearing
it
next
sunday
he
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
foley
edged
away
good
enough
he
said
shaking
his
head

a
good
many
bets
with

first
and
last
alf
but
i
ca
remember
as
i
ever
won

yet
so
friends
in
need
joseph
gibbs
finished
his
in
the
private
bar
of
the
red
lion
with
the
slowness
of
a
man
unable
to
see
where
the
next
was
coming
from
and
placing
the
mug
on
the
counter
filled
his
pipe
from
a
small
paper
of
tobacco
and
shook
his
head
slowly
at
his
companions
i
since
ten
this
morning
he
said
in
a
hard
voice
up
said
george
brown
ca
go
on
for
ever
said
bob
kidd
encouragingly
i
ask
for
is
work
said
gibbs
impressively
slavery
mind
yer
but
rather
difficult
to
distinguish
said
brown
for
some
people
added
kidd
on
said
gibbs
gloomily
on
stand
a
man
a
pint
and
then
go
and
hurt
feelings
twice
yesterday
i
wondered
to
myself
what
it
would
feel
like
to
make
a
hole
in
the
o
chaps
do
do
it
said
brown
musingly
leave
their
wives
and
families
to
starve
said
gibbs
icily
often
the
wife
is
better
off
said
his
friend
one
mouth
less
for
her
to
feed
besides
she
gets
something
when
pore
old
bill
went
they
a
friendly
lead
at
the
head
and
got
his
missis
pretty
nearly
seventeen
i
believe
we
get
more
than
that
for
your
old
woman
said
kidd
no
kids
and
she
could
keep
easy
not
that
i
want
to
encourage
you
to
make
away
with
gibbs
scowled
and
tilting
his
mug
peered
gloomily
into
the
interior
wo
make
no
in
the
water
said
brown
wagging
his
head
it
was
beer
now
gibbs
turned
and
drawing
himself
up
to
five
feet
three
surveyed
the
speaker
with
an
offensive
stare
do
see
why
he
need
make
a
in
anything
said
kidd
slowly
do
just
as
well
if
we
said
he
then
we
could
pass
the
hat
round
and
share
it
into
three
halves
and
each
one
said
brown
nodding
is
it
to
be
done
some
more
beer
and
think
it
over
said
kidd
pale
with
excitement
pints
he
and
brown
took
up
their
pints
and
nodded
at
each
other
gibbs
toying
idly
with
the
handle
of
his
eyed
them
carefully
i
not
promising
anything
he
said
slowly
i
of
myself
by
drinking
this
leave
it
to
me
joe
said
kidd
gibbs
left
it
to
him
after
a
discussion
in
which
pints
played
a
persuasive
part
with
the
result
that
brown
sitting
in
the
same
bar
the
next
evening
with
two
or
three
friends
was
rudely
disturbed
by
the
cyclonic
entrance
of
kidd
who
dripping
with
water
sank
on
a
bench
and
breathed
heavily
up
what
the
matter
demanded
several
voices
joe
poor
joe
gibbs
said
kidd
was
on
smith
wharf
shifting
that
lighter
to
the
next
berth
and
o
course
joe
must
come
aboard
to
help
he
was
shoving
her
off
with
foot
when
he
broke
off
and
shuddered
and
accepting
a
mug
of
beer
pending
the
arrival
of
some
brandy
that
a
sympathizer
had
ordered
drank
it
slowly
all
in
a
flash
he
said
looking
round
the
time
i
run
round
to
his
end
he
was
just
going
down
for
the
third
time
i
hung
over
the
side
and
grabbed
at
and
his
collar
and
tie
came
off
in
my
hand
nearly
went
in
i
he
held
out
the
collar
and
tie
and
approving
notice
was
taken
of
the
fact
that
he
was
soaking
wet
from
the
top
of
his
head
to
the
middle
button
of
his
waistcoat
chap
said
the
landlord
leaning
over
the
bar
was
in
only
an
hour
ago
standing
in
this
very
he
his
last
drop
o
beer
said
a
carman
in
a
chastened
voice
more
than
anybody
can
say
said
the
landlord
sharply
never
heard
anything
against
the
man
he
led
a
good
life
so
far
as
i
know
and
can
we
tell
that
he
wo
beer
he
made
kidd
a
present
of
another
small
glass
of
brandy
did
leave
any
family
did
he
he
inquired
as
he
passed
it
over
a
wife
said
kidd
who

tell
that
pore
soul
i
know
she
fair
doated
on
she
to
live
i
do
know
i

said
brown
in
a
deep
voice

to
be
done
for
said
the
carman
as
he
went
out
thing
is
to
tell
the
police
said
the
landlord
ought
to
know
then
one
of
them

her
it
what
they
paid
so
awfully
sudden
i
do
know

said
kidd
do
believe
she

a
in
the
pore
joe
a
lot
o
pals
i
wonder
whether
we
get
up
something
for
round
and
tell
the
police
first
said
the
landlord
pursing
up
his
lips
thoughtfully
can
talk
about
that
later
kidd
thanked
him
warmly
and
withdrew
accompanied
by
brown
twenty
minutes
later
they
left
the
station
considerably
relieved
at
the
way
in
which
the
police
had
received
the
tidings
and
hurrying
across
london
bridge
made
their
way
towards
a
small
figure
supporting
its
back
against
a
post
in
the
borough
market
said
gibbs
snappishly
as
he
turned
at
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
be
all
right
joe
said
kidd
sowed
the
the
wot
demanded
the
other
kidd
explained
said
gibbs
while
your
precious
seed
is
up
wot
am
i
to
do
wot
about
my
comfortable
wot
about
my
bed
and
grub
his
two
friends
looked
at
each
other
uneasily
in
the
excitement
of
the
arrangements
they
had
for
gotten
these
things
and
a
long
and
sometimes
painful
experience
of
gibbs
showed
them
only
too
plainly
where
they
were
drifting
to
get
a
bed
this
side
o
the
river
somewhere
said
brown
slowly
or
something
and
a
smart
active
man
wot
keeps
his
eyes
open
can
always
pick
up
a
little
gibbs
laughed
mind
said
kidd
furiously
in
reply
to
the
laugh
we
lend
you
is
to
be
paid
back
out
of
your
half
when
you
get
it
and
more
you
do
get
a
till
you
come
into
a
barber
shop
and
them
whiskers
off
we
do
want
no
gibbs
with
his
back
against
the
post
fought
for
his
whiskers
for
nearly
half
an
hour
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
was
led
into
a
barber
and
in
a
state
of
sullen
indignation
proffered
his
request
for
a
shave
he
gazed
at
the
creature
that
confronted
him
in
the
glass
after
the
operation
in
consternation
and
kidd
and
brown
politeness
easily
gave
way
before
their
astonishment
i
may
as
well
have
a
while
i
here
said
gibbs
after
a
lengthy
survey
a
shampoo
sir
said
the
assistant
as
you
like
said
gibbs
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
the
frenzied
expostulations
of
his
financial
backers
is
it
illustration
gibbs
with
his
back
against
the
post
fought
for
nearly
half
an
hour
he
sat
in
amazed
discomfort
during
the
operation
and
emerging
with
his
friends
remarked
that
he
felt
half
a
stone
lighter
the
information
was
received
in
stony
silence
and
having
spent
some
time
in
the
selection
they
found
a
quiet
and
in
a
retired
corner
formed
themselves
into
a
committee
of
ways
and
means
do
for
you
to
go
on
with
said
kidd
after
he
and
brown
had
each
made
a
contribution
mind
it
coming
off
of
your
gibbs
nodded
any
evening
you
want
to
see
me
you
find
me
in
here
he
remarked
ripping
now
you
better
go
and
see
my
old
the
two
friends
departed
and
to
their
great
relief
found
a
little
knot
of
people
outside
the
abode
of
gibbs
it
was
clear
that
the
news
had
been
already
broken
and
pushing
their
way
upstairs
they
found
the
widow
with
a
damp
handkerchief
in
her
hand
surrounded
by
attentive
friends
in
feeble
accents
she
thanked
kidd
for
his
noble
attempts
at
rescue
ai
dry
yet
said
brown
done
wot
i
could
said
kidd
simply
joe
nobody
could
ha
had
a
better
pal
nobody
ready
to
lend
a
helping
to
them
as
was
in
trouble
he
was
said
brown
looking
round
said
a
voice
we
lend
a
helping
said
kidd
energetically
ca
do
no
good
pore
chap
but
we
can
try
and
do
something
for
as
is
left
he
moved
slowly
to
the
door
accompanied
by
brown
and
catching
the
eye
of
one
or
two
of
the
men
beckoned
them
to
follow
under
his
able
guidance
a
small
but
gradually
increasing
crowd
made
its
way
to
the
for
the
next
three
or
four
days
the
friends
worked
unceasingly
cards
stating
that
a
friendly
lead
would
be
held
at
the
lion
for
the
benefit
of
the
widow
of
the
late
joseph
gibbs
were
distributed
broadcast
and
anecdotes
portraying
a
singularly
rare
and
beautiful
character
obtained
an
even
wider
circulation
too
late
wapping
realized
the
benevolent
disposition
and
the
kindly
but
unobtrusive
nature
that
had
departed
from
it
for
ever
gibbs
from
his
retreat
across
the
water
fully
shared
his
enthusiasm
but
an
insane
desire
engendered
by
vanity
to
be
present
at
the
function
was
a
source
of
considerable
trouble
and
annoyance
to
them
when
he
offered
to
black
his
face
and
take
part
in
the
entertainment
as
a
nigger
minstrel
kidd
had
to
be
led
outside
and
kept
there
until
such
time
as
he
could
converse
in
english
pure
and
undefiled
above
that
wot
it
is
said
brown
as
they
wended
their
way
home
having
too
much
money
out
of
us
to
spend
but
it
wo
be
for
long
having
a
lord
life
of
it
while
we
slaving
ourselves
to
death
grumbled
kidd
never
looking
so
fat
and
well
by
rights
he
ought
to
the
same
share
as
wot
we
going
to
he
ai
doing
none
of
the
his
lasted
until
the
night
of
the
which
largely
owing
to
the
presence
of
a
sporting
fishmonger
who
had
done
well
at
the
races
that
day
and
some
of
his
friends
realized
a
sum
far
beyond
the
expectations
of
the
promoters
the
fishmonger
led
off
by
placing
a
note
in
the
plate
and
the
packed
audience
breathed
so
hard
that
the
responsibility
began
to
weigh
upon
his
spirits
in
all
a
financial
tribute
of
pounds
three
and
fourpence
was
paid
to
the
memory
of
the
late
gibbs
twelve
quid
apiece
said
the
delighted
kidd
as
he
bade
his
good
night
too
good
to
be
the
next
day
passed
all
too
slowly
but
work
was
over
at
last
and
kidd
led
the
way
over
london
bridge
a
yard
or
two
ahead
of
the
more
phlegmatic
brown
gibbs
was
in
his
old
corner
at
the
arms
and
instead
of
going
into
ecstasies
over
the
sum
realized
hinted
darkly
that
it
would
have
been
larger
if
he
had
been
allowed
to
have
had
a
hand
in
it
pay
me
for
my
trouble
he
said
shaking
his
head
very
dull
over
all
alone
by
myself
by
the
time
you
two
have
your
share
besides
taking
wot
i
owe
you
there
be
anything
talk
to
you
another
time

he
walked
along
by
the
side
of
them
and
after
some
demur
consented
as
a
further
disguise
to
put
on
a
pair
of
spectacles

went
off
at
a
brisk
pace
with
brown

pace
moderated
to
one
of
almost
funeral
solemnity
as
they
approached
the
residence
of
gibbs
to
their
relief

he
bustled
cheerfully
out
of
the
room
and
downstairs
and
gibbs
motioning
brown
to
silence
stood
by
the
door
with
parted
lips
waiting
three
or
four
minutes
elapsed
they
come
said
brown
as
footsteps
sounded
on
the
stairs
no
screaming
mind
gibbs
drew
back
and
to
the
gratification
of
all
concerned
did
not
utter
a
sound
as
kidd
followed
by
her
husband
entered
the
room
she
stood
looking
expectantly
towards
the
doorway
is
he
she
gasped
said
kidd
in
a
startled
voice
here
do

susan
said
gibbs
in
a
low
voice
i
might
known
it
was
a
joke
cried
gibbs
in
a
faint
voice
as
she
tottered
to
a
chair
cruel
of
you
to
tell
me
my
pore
joe
was
alive
oh
could
you
lumme
said
the
incensed
kidd
pushing
gibbs
forward
he
is
same
as
you
saw
last
except
for
whiskers
make
that
sobbing
noise
people
be
coming
oh
oh
take
away
cried
gibbs
and
play
your
tricks
with
somebody
else
broken
it
your
husband
said
brown
away
wailed
gibbs
kidd
grinding
his
teeth
tried
to
think
you
got
any
marks
on
your
body
joe
he
inquired
ai
got
a
mark
on
me
said
gibbs
with
a
satisfied
air
a
blemish
my
skin
is
as
whi
enough
about
your
skin
interrupted
kidd
rudely
you
ai
all
of
you
gone
before
i
count
ten
said
gibbs
in
a
suppressed
voice
scream
dare
you
come
into
a
respectable
woman
place
and
talk
about
your
skins
are
you
going
one
two
three
four
five
her
voice
rose
with
each
numeral
and
gibbs
himself
led
the
way
downstairs
and
followed
by
his
friends
slipped
nimbly
round
the
corner
a
wonder
she
did
rouse
the
whole
he
said
wiping
his
brow
on
his
sleeve
where
should
we
ha
been
then
i
thought
at
the
time
it
was
a
mistake
you
making
me
my
whiskers
off
but
i
let
you
know
best
she
never
seen
me
without
i
a
remarkable
strong
growth
when
i
was
quite
a
boy
while
other
boys
was
vociferated
kidd
said
gibbs
defiantly
enough
of
being
away
from
my
comfortable
little
and
my
wife
and
i
going
to
let
start
growing
agin
this
very
night
she
never
reckernize
me
without
that
right
bob
said
brown
with
conviction
d
mean
to
tell
me
we
got
to
wait
till
blasted
whiskers
grow
cried
kidd
almost
dancing
with
fury
go
on
keeping
in
idleness
till
they
do
get
it
all
back
out
o
my
share
said
gibbs
with
dignity
you
can
please
yourself
if
you
like
to
call
it
quits
now
i
brown
took
his
seething
friend
aside
and
conferred
with
him
in
low
but
earnest
tones
gibbs
with
an
indifferent
air
stood
by
whistling
softly
long
will
they
take
to
grow
inquired
kidd
turning
to
him
with
a
growl
gibbs
shrugged
his
shoulders
say
he
replied
i
should
think
two
or
three
weeks
would
be
enough
for
to
reckernize
me
by
if
she
do
we
must
wait
another
week
or
so
that
there
wo
be
much
o
your
share
left
mind
that
said
kidd
glowering
at
him
ca
help
it
said
gibbs
need
keep
reminding
me
of
they
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
in
silence
and
for
the
next
fortnight
gibbs
friends
paid
nightly
visits
to
note
the
change
in
his
appearance
and
grumble
at
its
slowness
try
and
pull
it
off
night
said
kidd
at
the
end
of
that
period
fair
sick
o
lending
you
gibbs
shook
his
head
and
spoke
sagely
about
not
spoiling
the
ship
for
a
o
tar
but
kidd
was
obdurate
enough
for
to
reckernize
you
by
he
said
sternly
we
do
want
other
people
to
meet
us
at
the
monument
at
eight
night
and
we
get
it
your
orders
said
gibbs
in
a
nasty
voice
your
well
over
your
eyes
commanded
kidd
sternly
them
spectacles
on
wot
i
lent
you
and
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
if
you
tied
your
face
up
in
a
piece
o
red
know
wot
i
going
to
do
without
you
telling
me
said
gibbs
nodding
bet
you
pots
round
that
you
do
either
of
you
reckernize
me
tomorrow
the
bet
was
taken
at
once
and
from
eight
until
ten
minutes
to
nine
the
following
night
kidd
and
brown
did
their
best
to
win
it
then
did
kidd
turning
to
brown
in
perplexity
inquire
with
many
redundant
words
what
it
all
meant
illustration
exclaimed
both
gentlemen
must
gone
on
by
said
brown
better
go
and
in
a
state
of
some
disorder
they
hurried
back
to
wapping
and
mounting
the
stairs
to
gibbs
room
found
the
door
fast
to
their
fervent
and
repeated
knocking
there
was
no
answer
you
wo
make
her
said
a
woman
thrusting
an
untidy
head
over
the
balusters
on
the
next
landing
exclaimed
both
gentlemen
said
the
woman
went
off
this
kidd
leaned
up
against
the
wall
for
support
brown
stood
and
voiceless
was
a
surprise
to
me
said
the
woman
she
told
me
this
morning
she
been
getting
ready
on
the
quiet
for
the
last
fortnight
good
spirits
she
was
in
too
laughing
like
repeated
kidd
in
a
terrible
voice
the
woman
nodded
when
i
spoke
about
it
and
reminded
that
she
only
just
lost
pore
husband
i
thought
she
would
ha
burst
she
said
severely
sat
down
on
that
stair
and
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
dowwn
face
like
brown
turned
a
bewildered
face
upon
his
partner
he
said
slowly
she
got
to
laugh
at
replied
kidd
good
intentions
that
wot
it
is
said
the
trying
to
sneer
he
had
left
his
broom
for
a
hurried
at
the
left
it
leaning
in
a
negligent
attitude
against
the
now
lashed
to
the
top
of
the
crane
at
the
jetty
end
it
pointed
its
soiled
bristles
towards
the
evening
sky
and
defied
capture
i
know
who
it
is
and
why
done
it
he
continued
and
last
i
do
suppose
i
was
talking
to
the
gal
for
more
than
ten
minutes
and
of
that
was
about
the
weather
do
suppose
anybody
suffered
more
from
jealousy
than
wot
i
other
people
jealousy
i
mean
ever
since
i
was
married
the
missis
has
been
setting
traps
for
me
and
asking
people
to
keep
an
eye
on
me
i
blacked
one
of
the
eyes
once
like
a
fool
and
the
chap
it
belonged
to
made
up
a
tale
about
me
that
i
ai
lived
down
yet
ago
when
i
was
out
with
the
missis
one
evening
i
saved
a
life
for
her
she
slipped
as
she
was
getting
off
a
bus
and
i
caught
just
in
time
fine
strapping
gal
she
was
and
afore
i
could
get
my
balance
we
danced
round
and
round
acrost
the
road
with
our
arms
round
each
other
necks
and
my
missis
watching
us
from
the
pavement
when
we
were
safe
she
said
the
gal
slipped
at
all
and
as
soon
as
the
gal
got
breath
i
blest
if
she
did
say
so
too
ca
argufy
with
jealous
people
and
you
ca
shame
when
i
told
my
missis
once
that
i
should
never
dream
of
being
jealous
of
her
instead
of
up
and
thanking
me
for
it
she
spoilt
the
best
we
ever
had
when
the
but
two
and
me
rheumatics
at
the
same
time
she
went
and
asked
the
doctor
whether
it
was
catching
worse
trouble
o
that
kind
i
ever
got
into
was
all
through
trying
to
do
somebody
else
a
kindness
i
went
out
o
my
way
to
do
it
i
wasted
the
whole
evening
for
the
sake
of
other
people
and
got
into
such
trouble
over
it
that
even
now
it
gives
me
the
cold
shivers
to
think
of
tarbell
was
the
man
i
tried
to
do
a
good
turn
to
a
man
what
used
to
be
master
of
a
ketch
called
the
and
annie
trading
between
and
shoremouth
jack
he
used
to
be
called
and
if
ever
a
man
deserved
the
name
he
did
a
of
about
fifty
and
as
silly
as
a
boy
of
fifteen
he
been
talking
of
getting
married
agin
for
over
ten
years
and
thinking
it
was
only
talk
i
did
give
any
good
advice
then
he
told
me
one
night
that
was
keeping
company
with
a
woman
named
lamb
who
lived
at
a
place
near
shoremouth
when
i
asked
what
she
looked
like
he
said
that
she
had
a
good
and
knowing
wot
that
meant
i
was
at
all
surprised
when
he
told
me
some
time
arter
that
had
been
a
silly
fool
if
she
got
a
good
i
ses
she
let
you
go
sense
he
ses
ai
good
enough
for
that
why
she
worships
the
ground
i
tread
on
she
thinks
there
is
nobody
like
me
in
the
whole
wide
world
she
think
so
arter
you
married
i
ses
trying
to
cheer
him
up
not
going
to
get
married
he
ses
not
to
but
to
get
out
of
it
without
breaking
her
and
being
had
up
for
breach
o
promise
i
ca
think
and
if
the
other
one
got
to
of
it
i
should
lose
her
too
one
i
ses
other
one
tarbell
shook
his
and
smiled
like
a
silly
gal
fell
in
love
with
me
on
top
of
a
bus
in
the
mile
end
road
he
ses
at
fust
sight
it
was
she
a
widder
lady
with
a
nice
little
at
bow
and
plenty
to
live
having
been
a
builder
i
know
what
to
do
you
see
if
i
married
both
of
it
sure
to
be
found
out
sooner
or
later
be
found
out
as
it
is
i
ses
you
ai
careful
surprised
at
you
he
ses
getting
up
and
walking
backwards
and
forwards
as
plimmer
is
always
talking
about
coming
down
to
see
the
ship
one
thing
is
the
crew
wo
give
me
away
they
been
with
me
too
long
for
that
you
could
give
me
a
little
advice
bill
did
i
talked
to
that
man
for
an
hour
and
and
when
i
finished
he
said
he
did
want
that
kind
of
advice
at
all
wot
wanted
was
for
me
to
tell
to
get
rid
of
miss
lamb
and
marry
plimmer
without
anybody
being
offended
or
having
their
feelings
hurt
plimmer
came
down
to
the
ship
the
very
next
evening
woman
she
was
and
wot
with
watch
and
chain
and
rings
and
brooches
and
i
should
think
she
must
five
or
six
pounds
worth
of
on
she
gave
me
a
very
pleasant
smile
and
i
gave
one
back
and
we
stood
chatting
there
like
old
friends
till
at
last
she
tore
away
and
went
on
board
the
ship
came
off
by
and
by
hanging
on
tarbell
arm
the
was
dressed
up
in
sunday
clothes
with
one
of
the
cleanest
collars
on
i
ever
seen
in
my
life
and
smoking
a
cigar
that
smelt
like
an
escape
of
gas
he
came
back
alone
at
eleven
that
night
and
told
me
that
if
it
was
for
the
other
one
down
shoremouth
way
he
should
be
the
man
on
earth
plimmer
only
got
one
fault
he
ses
shaking
his
that
jealousy
if
she
got
to
know
of
laura
lamb
it
would
be
all
it
makes
me
go
cold
all
over
when
i
think
of
it
the
only
thing
is
to
get
married
as
quick
as
i
can
then
she
ca
help
would
prevent
the
other
one
making
a
fuss
though
i
ses
he
ses
very
thoughtfully
would
i
shall
to
do
something
there
but
wot
i
do
know
climbed
on
board
like
a
man
with
a
load
on
his
mind
and
arter
a
look
at
the
sky
went
below
and
forgot
both
troubles
in
sleep
plimmer
came
down
to
the
wharf
every
time
the
ship
was
up
arter
that
sometimes
she
spend
the
evening
aboard
and
sometimes
they
go
off
and
spend
it
somewhere
else
she
a
fancy
for
the
cabin
i
think
and
the
told
me
that
she
said
when
they
were
married
she
was
going
to
sail
with
sometimes
it
ai
for
six
months
yet
he
ses
a
lot
o
things
might
to
the
other
one
in
that
time
with
luck
was
just
about
a
month
arter
that
that
came
to
me
one
evening
trembling
all
over
i
just
come
on

afore

there
staring
arter

feeling
the
money
and
afore
i
could
make
up
my
mind
plimmer
came
up
thought
i

she
stood
there
chatting
and
smiling
and
seemed
to
forget
all
about
the
and
every
moment
i
was
afraid
that
the
other
one
might
come
up
at
last
she
went
off
looking
behind
to
the
ship
and
then
i
went
outside
and
put
my
back
up
agin
the
gate
and
waited
hardly
been
there
ten
minutes
afore
the
other
one
came
along
i
saw
stop
and
speak
to
a
policeman
and
then
she
came
straight
over
to
me
want
to
see
tarbell
she
ses
tarbell
i
ses
very
slow
tarbell
gone
off
for
the
evening
off
she
ses
staring
he
ca
are
you
sure
i
ses
then
i
a
bright
idea
there
a
letter
come
for
i
ses
dear
she
ses
i
thought
it
would
be
in
plenty
of
time
well
i
must
go
on
the
ship
and
wait
for
i
suppose
i
only
let
go
i
should
ha
saved
myself
a
lot
o
trouble
and
the
man
wot
deserved
it
would
ha
got
it
instead
o
that
i
told
about
the
and
arter
carrying
on
like
a
silly
gal
o
seventeen
and
saying
she
could
think
of
it
she
gave
way
and
said
she
go
with
me
to
find
i
was
all
right
so
far
as
clothes
went
as
it
happened
plimmer
said
once
that
i
got
more
and
more
dressy
every
time
she
saw
me
and
my
missis
said
the
same
thing
only
in
a
different
way
i
just
took
a
peep
through
the
wicket
and
saw
that
joe
taken
up
my
dooty
and
then
we
set
off
said
i
was
quite
sure
which
one
he
gone
to
but
we
try
the
pagoda
fust
and
we
went
there
on
a
bus
from
aldgate
it
was
the
fust
evening
out
i
for
years
and
i
should
enjoyed
it
if
it
been
for
miss
lamb
wotever
tarbell
could
ha
seen
in
i
ca
think
was
quiet
and
stupid
and
when
the
came
round
for
the
fares
she
got
any
change
and
when
we
got
to
the
hall
she
did
such
eggsterrordinary
things
trying
to
find
pocket
that
i
tried
to
look
as
if
she
did
belong
to
me
when
she
left
off
she
smiled
and
said
she
was
farther
off
than
ever
and
arter
three
or
four
wot
was
standing
there
begged
to
have
another
try
i
to
pay
for
the
two
was
pretty
full
when
we
got
in
but
she
did
take
no
notice
of
that
her
idea
was
that
she
could
walk
about
all
over
the
place
looking
for
tarbell
and
it
took
three
men
in
buttons
and
a
policeman
to
persuade
different
we
were
pushed
into
a
couple
seats
at
last
and
then
she
started
finding
fault
with
me
is
tarbell
she
ses
do
you
find
him
go
and
look
for
in
the
bar
presently
i
ses
sure
to
be
there
arter
a
turn
or
two
managed
to
keep
quiet
for
an
hour
with
the
of
the
people
wot
sat
near
us
and
then
i
to
go
i
a
glass
o
beer
to
pass
the
time
away
and
while
i
was
drinking
it
who
should
come
up
but
the
cook
and
one
of
the
hands
from
the
and
saw
you
ses
the
cook
winking
we
bob
ses
bob
shaking
his
silly
it
was
no
surprise
to
me
i
my
eye
on
for
a
long
time
past
thought

the
cook

is

to
the
best
wife
in
london
i
know
where
she
lives

bottle
o
bass
he
ses
turning
to
me
mine
ses
the
cook
paid
for
two
bottles
for
and
arter
that
they
said
that
a
whisky
and
soda
apiece
just
to
show
as
there
was
no
very
good
ses
bob
sipping
his
it
wants
a
sixpenny
cigar
to
go
with
it
it
been
the
dream
o
my
life
to
smoke
a
sixpenny
cigar
it
mine
ses
the
cook
i
do
suppose
i
ever
shall
both
coughed
arter
that
and
like
a
goodnatured
fool
i
stood
a
sixpenny
cigar
apiece
and
i
just
turned
to
go
back
to
my
seat
when
up
come
two
more
hands
from
the
lizzie
and
annie
watchman
ses
one
of
i
thought
you
was
care
of
the
wharf
got
something
better
than
the
wharf
to
take
care
of
ses
bob
grinning
know
we
see
ses
the
other
chap
been
watching
for
the
last
better
than
a
play
it
was
stopped
their
mouths
with
a
glass
o
bitter
each
and
went
back
to
my
seat
while
they
was
drinking
it
i
told
miss
lamb
in
whispers
that
was
there
but
i
another
look
for
him
by
and
by
if
she
whispered
back
it
would
ha
been
all
right
but
she
would
and
arter
a
most
unpleasant
scene
she
walked
out
with
her
in
the
air
follered
by
me
with
two
men
in
buttons
and
a
policeman
course
nothing
would
do
but
she
must
go
back
to
the
wharf
and
wait
for
tarbell
and
all
the
way
there
i
was
wondering
wot
would
if
she
went
on
board
and
found
there
with
plimmer
however
when
we
got
there
i
persuaded
to
go
into
the
office
while
i
went
aboard
to
see
if
i
could
find
out
where
he
was
and
three
minutes
arterwards
he
was
standing
with
me
behind
the
galley
trembling
all
over
and
patting
me
on
the
back
in
the
office
a
little
longer
he
ses
in
a
whisper
other
going
soon
keep
there
as
long
as
you
can
suppose
she
sees
you
and
plimmer
passing
the
window
i
ses
be
all
right
i
going
to
take
to
the
stairs
in
the
boat
he
ses
more
romantic
gave
me
a
little
punch
in
the
ribs
playfullike
and
arter
telling
me
i
was
worth
my
weight
in
went
back
to
the
cabin
agin
told
miss
lamb
that
the
cabin
was
locked
up
but
that
tarbell
was
expected
back
in
about
time
then
i
found
an
old
newspaper
and
a
comfortable
chair
and
sat
down
to
wait
i
could
go
on
the
wharf
for
fear
she
want
to
come
with
me
and
i
sat
there
as
patient
as
i
could
till
a
little
clicking
noise
made
us
both
start
up
and
look
at
each
other
that
she
ses
listening
sounded
i
ses
sounded
like
somebody
locking
the
door
went
to
the
door
to
try
it
just
as
somebody
dashed
past
the
window
with
their
down

was
locked
fast
and
arter
i
had
a
try
at
it
and
miss
lamb

a
try
at
it

stood
and
looked
at
each
other
in

a
joke
on

door
at
once
if
you

at
the
windows
but
the
iron
bars
wot
was
strong
enough
to
keep
the
vans
outside
was
strong
enough
to
keep
in
and
then
she
gave
way
to
such
a
fit
o
temper
that
i
could
do
nothing
with
tarbell

chase
mellowed
by
a
long
draught
placed
his
mug
on
the
counter
and
eyeing
him
kindly
said
been
in
my
lodgings
thirteen
know
said
teak
i
got
a
partikler
reason
for
wanting
you
our
lodger
dunn
left
last
week
and
i
only
thought
of
you
yesterday
i
mentioned
you
to
my
missis
and
she
was
quite
pleased
you
see
she
knows
i
known
you
for
over
twenty
years
and
she
wants
to
make
sure
of
only
honest
people
in
the
she
has
got
a
reason
for
he
closed
one
eye
and
nodded
with
great
significance
at
his
friend
said
chase
waiting
a
rich
woman
said
teak
pulling
the
other
ear
down
to
his
mouth
you
done
tickling
me
with
your
whiskers
said
chase
withdrawing
his
head
and
rubbing
his
ear
vigorously
shall
be
teak
apologized
rich
woman
he
repeated
been
stinting
me
for
years
and
saving
the
money
my
money
money
that
i
earned
with
the
sweat
of
my
brow
she
got
over
three
pounds
much
demanded
chase
pounds
and
more
repeated
the
other
if
she
had
the
sense
to
put
it
in
a
bank
it
would
ha
been
over
four
by
this
time
instead
o
that
she
keeps
it
hid
in
the
inquired
the
greatly
interested
chase
teak
shook
his
head
just
what
i
want
to
find
out
he
answered
do
know
i
know
it
and
she
must
know
either
that
did
you
find
out
about
it
then
inquired
his
friend
wife
sister
husband
bert
adams
told
me
his
wife
told
in
strict
confidence
and
i
might
gone
to
my
grave
without
knowing
about
it
only
she
smacked
his
face
for
the
other
it
in
the
house
you
ought
to
be
able
to
find
it
easy
enough
said
chase
it
all
very
well
to
talk
retorted
teak
missis
never
leaves
the
unless
i
with
her
except
when
i
at
work
and
if
she
thought
i
knew
of
it
she
take
and
put
it
in
some
bank
or
somewhere
unbeknown
to
me
and
i
should
be
farther
off
it
than
you
got
no
idea
said
chase
the
leastest
bit
said
the
other
never
thought
for
a
moment
she
was
saving
money
she
always
asking
me
for
more
for
one
thing
but
then
women
alway
do
and
look
bad
it
is
for
her
saving
money
like
that
on
the
sly
she
might
grow
into
a
miser
pore
thing
for
own
sake
i
ought
to
get
hold
of
it
if
it
only
to
save
her
from
chase
face
reflected
the
gravity
of
his
own
the
only
man
i
can
trust
continued
teak
i
thought
if
you
came
as
lodger
you
might
be
able
to
find
out
where
it
is
hid
and
get
hold
of
it
for
steal
it
d
mean
demanded
the
gaping
chase
suppose
she
got
me
locked
up
for
it
i
should
look
pretty
should
i
you
find
out
where
it
is
hid
said
the
other
all
you
need
do
i
find
someway
of
getting
hold
of
it
if
you
ca
find
it
how
should
i
be
able
to
inquired
chase
you
opportunities
said
the
other
take
her
out
some
time
when
you
supposed
to
be
out
late
you
come
let
yourself
in
with
your
key
and
spot
the
i
get
the
cash
and
give
you
all
to
your
little
self
it
only
occurred
to
me
after
bert
told
me
about
it
that
i
ai
been
in
the
house
alone
for
he
ordered
some
more
beer
and
drawing
chase
to
a
bench
sat
down
to
a
long
and
steady
argument
it
shook
his
faith
in
human
nature
to
find
that
his
friend
estimated
the
affair
as
a
job
but
he
was
in
no
position
to
bargain
they
came
out
smoking
twopenny
cigars
whose
strength
was
remarkable
for
their
age
and
before
they
parted
chase
was
pledged
to
the
hilt
to
do
all
that
he
could
to
save
teak
from
the
vice
of
avarice
it
was
a
more
difficult
undertaking
than
he
had
supposed
the
house
small
and
compact
seemed
to
offer
few
opportunities
for
the
concealment
of
large
sums
of
money
and
after
a
fortnight
residence
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
treasure
must
have
been
hidden
in
the
garden
the
unalloyed
pleasure
however
with
which
teak
regarded
the
efforts
of
her
husband
to
put
under
cultivation
land
that
had
lain
fallow
for
twenty
years
convinced
both
men
that
they
were
on
a
wrong
scent
teak
who
did
the
digging
was
the
first
to
realize
it
but
his
friend
pointing
out
the
suspicions
that
might
be
engendered
by
a
sudden
cessation
of
labour
induced
him
to
persevere
try
and
look
as
if
you
liked
it
he
said
severely
from
the
window
even
the
back
view
of
you
looks
fair
sick
of
it
declared
teak
might
ha
known
she
would
have
buried
it
in
the
garden
she
must
been
saving
for
pretty
near
thirty
years
week
by
week
and
she
could
keep
coming
out
here
to
hide
it
chase
pondered
her
know
casual
like
that
i
be
till
late
on
saturday
he
said
slowly
you
come
in
the
afternoon
and
take
her
out
as
soon
as
you
gone
i
pop
in
and
have
a
thorough
good
hunt
round
is
she
fond
of
animals
so
said
the
other
staring
to
the
zoo
said
chase
impressively
o
nuts
with
you
for
the
monkeys
and
some
stale
buns
for
for
for
animals
as
likes
give
a
ride
on
the
elephant
and
a
ride
on
the
else
inquired
teak
disagreeably
more
ways
you
can
think
of
for
me
to
spend
my
money
do
as
i
tell
you
said
his
friend
got
an
idea
now
where
it
is
if
i
able
to
show
you
where
to
put
your
finger
on
three
pounds
when
you
come
it
be
the
cheapest
outing
you
have
ever
wo
it
teak
made
no
reply
but
after
spending
the
evening
in
deliberation
issued
the
invitation
at
the
his
wife
eyes
sparkled
at
first
then
the
light
slowly
faded
from
them
and
her
face
fell
ca
go
she
said
at
last
got
nothing
to
go
said
her
husband
starting
uneasily
a
fact
said
teak
should
like
to
go
too
it
years
since
i
was
at
the
zoo
i
might
make
my
jacket
do
it
my
hat
thinking
chase
meeting
teak
eye
winked
an
obvious
suggestion
thanking
you
all
the
same
continued
teak
with
amiable
cheerfulness
stay
at
much
are
they
growled
her
husband
scowling
at
chase
prices
replied
his
wife
i
know
said
teak
in
a
grating
voice
go
in
to
buy
a
hat
at
one
and
you
get
talked
over
and
flattered
by
a
man
like
a
barber
block
and
you
come
out
with
a
penny
one
the
only
real
difference
in
hats
is
the
price
but
women
can
never
see
teak
smiled
faintly
and
again
expressed
her
willingness
to
stay
at
home
they
could
spend
the
afternoon
working
in
the
garden
she
said
her
husband
with
another
indignant
glance
at
the
right
eye
of
chase
which
was
still
enacting
the
part
of
a
said
that
she
could
have
a
hat
but
asked
her
to
remember
when
buying
it
that
nothing
suited
her
so
well
as
a
plain
one
the
remainder
of
the
week
passed
away
slowly
and
teak
despite
his
utmost
efforts
was
unable
to
glean
any
information
from
chase
as
to
that
gentleman
ideas
concerning
the
at
every
suggestion
chase
smile
only
got
broader
and
more
indulgent
leave
it
to
me
he
said
leave
it
to
me
and
when
you
come
home
from
a
happy
outing
i
to
be
able
to
cross
your
little
hand
with
three
golden
why
not
tell
me
urged
teak
i
want
to
surprise
you
was
the
reply
mind
whatever
you
do
do
let
your
wife
run
away
with
the
idea
that
i
been
mixed
up
in
it
at
all
now
if
you
worry
me
any
more
i
shall
ask
you
to
make
it
thirty
pounds
for
me
instead
of
the
two
friends
parted
at
the
corner
of
the
road
on
saturday
afternoon
and
teak
conscious
of
his
friend
impatience
sought
to
hurry
his
wife
by
occasionally
calling
the
wrong
time
up
the
stairs
she
came
down
at
last
smiling
in
a
plain
hat
with
three
roses
two
bows
and
a
feather
had
the
feather
for
years
she
remarked
is
the
fourth
hat
it
has
been
on
but
then
i
taken
care
of
teak
grunted
and
opening
the
door
ushered
her
into
the
street
a
sense
of
adventure
and
the
hope
of
a
profitable
afternoon
made
his
spirits
rise
he
paid
a
compliment
to
the
hat
and
then
to
the
surprise
of
both
followed
it
up
with
another
a
very
little
one
to
his
wife
they
took
a
tram
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
for
the
sake
of
the
air
mounted
to
the
top
teak
leaned
back
in
her
seat
with
placid
enjoyment
and
for
the
first
ten
minutes
amused
herself
with
the
life
in
the
streets
then
she
turned
suddenly
to
her
husband
and
declared
that
she
had
felt
a
spot
of
rain
he
said
shortly
something
cold
touched
him
lightly
on
the
eyelid
a
tiny
pattering
sounded
from
the
seats
and
then
swish
down
came
the
rain
with
an
angry
exclamation
he
sprang
up
and
followed
his
wife
below
our
luck
she
said
mournfully
thing
we
can
do
is
to
stay
in
the
car
and
go
back
with
said
her
husband
in
a
startled
voice
be
over
in
a
events
proved
the
contrary
by
the
time
the
car
reached
the
terminus
it
was
coming
down
heavily
teak
settled
herself
squarely
in
her
seat
and
patches
of
blue
sky
visible
only
to
the
eye
of
faith
and
her
husband
failed
to
move
her
even
his
reckless
reference
to
a
cab
failed
no
good
she
said
tartly
ca
go
about
the
grounds
in
a
cab
and
i
not
going
to
slop
about
in
the
wet
to
please
anybody
we
must
go
another
time
it
hard
luck
but
there
worse
things
in
teak
wondering
as
to
the
operations
of
chase
agreed
dumbly
he
stopped
the
car
at
the
corner
of
their
road
and
holding
his
head
down
against
the
rain
sprinted
towards
home
teak
anxious
for
her
hat
passed
him
on
earth
the
matter
she
inquired
fumbling
in
her
pocket
for
the
key
as
her
husband
executed
a
clumsy
but
noisy
breakdown
on
the
front
step
replied
teak
got
he
resumed
his
lumberings
and
the
door
being
opened
gave
vent
to
his
relief
at
being
home
again
in
the
dry
in
a
voice
that
made
the
windows
rattle
then
with
anxious
eyes
he
watched
his
wife
pass
upstairs
what
excuse
old
alf
make
for
being
in
he
thought
he
stood
with
one
foot
on
the
bottom
stair
listening
acutely
he
heard
a
door
open
above
and
then
a
wild
shriek
rang
through
the
house
instinctively
he
dashed
upstairs
and
following
his
wife
into
their
bedroom
stood
by
her
side
gaping
stupidly
at
a
pair
of
legs
standing
on
the
hearthstone
as
he
watched
they
came
backwards
into
the
room
the
upper
part
of
a
body
materialized
from
the
chimney
and
turning
round
revealed
the
face
of
alfred
chase
another
wild
shriek
from
teak
greeted
its
appearance
exclaimed
teak
groping
for
the
right
thing
to
say
what
what
are
you
doing
alf
chase
blew
the
soot
from
his
lips
i
i
come
unexpected
he
stammered
what
are
you
doing
panted
teak
in
a
rising
voice
i
was
passing
your
door
said
chase
your
door
to
go
to
my
room
to
to
a
bit
of
a
rinse
when
said
teak
chase
gave
teak
a
glance
the
pathos
of
which
even
the
soot
could
not
conceal
i
i
heard
a
pore
little
bird
struggling
in
your
chimbley
he
continued
with
a
sigh
of
relief
fond
of
animals
i
took
the
liberty
of
comin
into
your
room
and
saving
its
teak
drew
a
breath
which
he
endeavoured
in
vain
to
render
noiseless
got
its
pore
little
foot
caught
in
the
brickwork
continued
the
veracious
chase
tenderly
released
it
and
it
flowed
i
mean
flew
up
the
with
the
shamefaced
air
of
a
man
detected
in
the
performance
of
a
noble
action
he
passed
out
of
the
room
husband
and
wife
eyed
each
other
alf
that
alf
all
over
said
teak
with
enthusiasm
been
like
it
from
a
child
he
the
sort
of
man
that
dive
off
waterloo
bridge
to
save
the
life
of
a
drownding
made
an
awful
mess
said
his
wife
frowning
take
me
the
rest
of
the
day
to
clean
up
there
soot
everywhere
the
rug
is
quite
she
took
off
her
hat
and
jacket
and
prepared
for
the
fray
down
below
teak
and
chase
comparing
notes
sought
with
much
warmth
to
put
the
blame
on
the
right
shoulders
it
ai
there
said
chase
finally
made
sure
of
that
that
something
towards
it
i
sha
to
look
there
again
thank
teak
sniffed
any
more
ideas
he
queried
have
said
the
other
sternly
plenty
of
places
to
search
yet
i
only
just
begun
get
her
out
as
much
as
you
can
and
i
my
hands
on
it
afore
you
can
say
suggested
teak
sourly
more
of
your
nasty
snacks
and
i
chuck
it
up
altogether
said
chase
heatedly
i
was
hard
up
i
drop
it
he
went
up
to
his
room
in
dudgeon
and
for
the
next
few
days
teak
saw
but
little
of
him
to
lure
teak
out
was
almost
as
difficult
as
to
persuade
a
snail
to
leave
its
shell
but
he
succeeded
on
two
or
three
occasions
and
each
time
she
added
something
to
her
wardrobe
the
assistant
had
been
in
residence
just
a
month
when
teak
returning
home
one
afternoon
stood
in
the
small
passage
listening
to
a
suppressed
wailing
noise
proceeding
from
upstairs
it
was
so
creepy
that
up
he
hesitated
and
in
a
stern
but
trembling
voice
demanded
to
know
what
his
wife
meant
by
it
a
louder
wail
than
before
was
the
only
reply
and
summoning
up
his
courage
he
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
peeped
in
his
gaze
fell
on
teak
who
was
sitting
on
the
rocking
to
and
fro
in
front
of
a
dismantled
what
the
matter
he
said
hastily
teak
raised
her
voice
to
a
pitch
that
set
his
teeth
on
edge
money
she
wailed
all
gone
all
gone
repeated
teak
hardly
able
to
contain
himself
money
all
my
savings
moaned
his
wife
said
the
delighted
teak
savings
i
have
been
putting
by
for
our
old
age
said
his
wife
hundred
and
pounds
all
gone
in
a
fit
of
sudden
generosity
teak
decided
then
and
there
that
chase
should
have
the
odd
pounds
dreaming
he
said
sternly
wish
i
was
said
his
wife
wiping
her
eyes
hundred
and
pounds
in
empty
every
gone
teak
eye
fell
on
the
stove
he
stepped
for
ward
and
examined
it
the
back
was
out
and
teak
calling
his
attention
to
a
tunnel
at
the
side
implored
him
to
put
his
arm
in
and
satisfy
himself
that
it
was
empty
where
could
you
get
all
that
money
from
he
demanded
after
a
prolonged
groping
sa
saved
it
sobbed
his
wife
our
old

age
repeated
teak
in
lofty
tones
suppose
i
had
died
first
or
suppose
you
had
died

this
is
what
comes
of
deceitfulness
and
keeping
things
from
your
husband
now
somebody
has
stole

her
head
and
sobbed
again

just
been
out
for
for
an
hour
she

back
i
fou
fou
found
the
washhouse
window
smashed
and
sobs
choked
her
utterance
teak
lost
in
admiration
of
cleverness
stood
regarding
her
in
silence

extraordinary
vehemence

stalked
solemnly
out
of
the
room
and
downstairs
and
safe
in
the
parlour
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
in
a
wild
but
silent
hornpipe
he
cannoned
against
the
table
at
last
and
subsiding
into
an
crammed
his
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
and
gave
way
to
suppressed
mirth
in
his
excitement

forgot
all
about
tea
and
the
bereaved
teak
made
no
attempt
to
come
downstairs
to
prepare
it
with
his
eye
on
the
clock
he
waited
with
what
patience
he
might
for
the
arrival
of
chase
the
usual
hour
for
his
return
came
and
went
another
hour
passed
and
another
a
horrible
idea
that
chase
had
been
robbed
gave
way
to
one
more
horrible
still
he
paced
the
room
in
dismay
until
at
nine
his
wife
came
down
and
in
a
languid
fashion
began
to
set
the
very
late
said
teak
thickly
he
said
his
wife
dully
late
said
teak
ca
think
ah
there
he
is
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
clenched
hands
together
by
the
time
chase
came
into
the
room
he
was
able
to
greet
him
with
a
stealthy
wink
chase
with
a
humorous
twist
of
his
mouth
winked
back
a
upset
said
teak
in
warning
tones
said
the
other
as
teak
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
and
sank
into
a
chair
about
in
bated
accents
interrupted
at
times
by
broken
murmurs
from
his
wife
teak
informed
him
of
the
robbery
chase
leaning
against
the
doorpost
listened
with
open
mouth
and
distended
eyeballs
occasional
interjections
of
pity
and
surprise
attested
his
interest
the
tale
finished
the
gentlemen
exchanged
a
significant
wink
and
sighed
in
unison
now
said
teak
an
hour
later
after
his
wife
had
retired
is
it
that
the
question
said
chase
roguishly
wonder
where
it
can
be
i
hope
it
in
a
safe
place
said
teak
anxiously

it
said
chase

you
getting
at
i
ai
put
it
anywhere
you
know
play
the
giddy
goat
said
the
other
testily
you
hid
it
is
it
safe
chase
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
shaking
his
head
at
him
smiled
approvingly
a
little
wonder
that
what
you
are
gussie
he
remarked
wonder
your
pore
wife
is
took
in
so
teak
sprang
up
in
a
fury
play
the
fool
he
said
hoarsely
the
money

want
it
now
where
you
put
it
on
said
chase
with
a
chuckle
on
do
mind
me
you
ought
to
be
on
the
stage
gussie
that
where
you
ought
to
not
joking
said
teak
in
a
trembling
voice

you

joke
with
me
if
you
think
you
are
going
off
with
my
money

if
you
do
tell
me
in
two
minutes
where
it
is
i

charge
for

chase
he
took
a
deep
breath
really
he
said
would
thought
it
of
you
gussie
i
would
thought
have
played
it
so
low
down
i
surprised
at

then

the
other
to

me
out
o
my
twenty
pounds

i
do

this
room
till
i
get
speechless
with
fury
teak
struck
at
him
the
next
moment
the
was
overturned
with
a
crash
and
chase
with
his
friend
in
his
powerful
grasp
was
doing
his
best
as
he
expressed
it
to
shake
the
life
out
of
him
a
faint
scream
sounded
from
above
steps
pattered
on
the
stairs
and
teak
with
a
red
shawl
round
her
shoulders
burst
into
the
room
chase
released
teak
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
then
thinking
better
of
it
dashed
into
the
passage
took
his
hat
from
the
peg
and
slamming
the
front
door
with
extraordinary
violence
departed
he
sent
round
for
his
clothes
next
day
but
he
did
not
see
teak
until
a
month
afterwards
his
fists
clenched
and
his
mouth
hardened
but
teak
with
a
pathetic
smile
held
out
his
hand
and
chase
after
a
moment
hesitation
took
it
teak
still
holding
his
friend
hand
piloted
him
to
a
neighbouring
hostelry
was
my
mistake
alf
he
said
shaking
his
head
it
was
my
fault
it
a
mistake
anybody
might
ha
you
found
out
who
took
it
inquired
chase
regarding
him
suspiciously
teak
gulped
and
nodded
met
bert
adams
yesterday
he
said
slowly
took
three
pints
afore
he
told
me
but
i
got
it
out
of
at
last
my
missis
took
it
chase
put
his
mug
down
with
a
bang
he
gasped
day
after
she
found
you
with
your
head
up
the
chimbley
added
teak
mournfully
shoved
it
away
in
some
bank
now
and
i
shall
never
see
a
of
it
if
you
was
a
married
man
alf
understand
it
better
you
would
be
surprised
at
illustration
i
was
kindness
to
animals
is
all
very
the
only
i
got
left
said
the
oldest
inhabitant
taking
a
long
slow
draught
of
beer
and
a
pipe
baccy
neither
of
wants
chewing
and
that
a
great
thing
when
you
ai
got
anything
worth
speaking
about
left
to
chew
he
put
his
mug
on
the
table
and
ignoring
the
stillness
of
the
summer
air
sheltered
the
flame
of
a
match
between
his
cupped
hands
and
conveyed
it
with
infinite
care
to
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
a
dull
but
crafty
old
eye
squinting
down
the
stem
assured
itself
that
the
tobacco
was
well
alight
before
the
match
was
thrown
away
i
was
kindness
to
animals
is
all
very
well
he
said
to
the
wayfarer
who
sat
opposite
him
in
the
shade
of
the
elms
kindness
to
your
is
more
the
pint
wot
you
give
me
is
gone
but
i
just
as
thankful
to
you
as
if
it
he
half
closed
his
eyes
and
gazing
on
to
the
fields
beyond
fell
into
a
reverie
so
deep
that
he
failed
to
observe
the
landlord
come
for
his
mug
and
return
with
it
filled
a
little
start
attested
his
surprise
and
to
his
great
annoyance
upset
a
couple
of
tablespoonfuls
of
the
precious
liquid
people
waste
all
their
kindness
on
dumb
animals
he
remarked
after
the
landlord
had
withdrawn
from
his
offended
vision
i
was
never
a
believer
in
it
i
mind
some
time
ago
when
a
from
lunnon
wot
more
money
than
sense
offered
a
prize
for
kindness
to
animals
i
was
the
only
one
that
did
try
for
to
win
it
bunnett
name
was
and
come
down
and
took
farmer
hall
for
the
summer
over
sixty
was
and
old
enough
to
know
better
he
used
to
put
saucers
of
milk
all
round
the
for
cats
to
drink
and
by
the
time
pore
farmer
hall
got
back
every
cat
for
three
miles
round
got
in
the
habit
of
coming
round
to
the
and
asking
for
milk
as
if
it
was
their
right
farmer
hall
poisoned
a
saucer
o
milk
at
last
and
then
to
pay
five
shillings
for
a
thin
black
cat
with
a
mangy
tail
and
one
eye
that
bob
pretty
said
belonged
to
children
farmer

to
jail
afore

pay
at
fust
but
arter
five
men
spoke
the
truth
and
said
they
see
bob

the
day
afore

and
it
was
the
fust
bit
o
money
made
out
o
bunnett
coming
to
the
place
all
come
through
bunnett
love
for
animals
i
never
see
a
man
so
fond
of
animals
as
was
and
if
he
had
way
claybury
would
been
overrun
by
by
this
time
the
day
arter
got
to
the
farm
he
could
eat
breakfuss
because
of
a
pig
that
was
being
killed
in
the
yard
and
it
was
no
good
pointing
out
to
that
the
pig
was
making
a
fuss
about
it
because
it
was
its
nature
so
to
do
he
lived
on
wegetables
and
such
like
and
the
way
carried
on
one
day
over
a
biled

up
and
offered
to
give
a
prize
of
a
gold

that
used
to
belong
to

to
the
one

did
seem
to
hear
he
was
on
the
ground
with
on

side
looking
at
the
toad
and
by
and
by
he
pulled
out
and
put
the
toad
in
it
as
if
it
was
made
of
and
walked
away

with
it

way
pore
thing

times

no
idea

fine
people
they
are
in
this

did
me
good
to

it
and
i
spoke
to
mr
chambers
about
drowning
kittens
and
he
told
me
had
slept
a
wink
ever
since
and
he
offered
to
take
your
old
cat
to
make
up
for
it
if
you
was
tired
of
keeping
it
was
very
on
henery
walker
i
must
say
that
other
people
was
getting
the
credit
of
bringing
up
kittens
and
more
than
that
they
used
to
ask
bunnett
into
their
places
to
see
the
little
dears
was
on
to
animals
caused
more
unpleasantness
in
claybury
than
anything
ever
done
afore
there
was
hardly
a
man
as
speak
civil
to
each
other
and
the
wimmen
was
as
bad
cats
and
dogs
and
began
to
act
as
if
the
place
belonged
to
and
seven
people
stopped
bunnett
one
day
to
tell
that
joe
parsons
been
putting
down
and
killed
five
little
baby
rats
and
their
mother
was
some
time
afore
anybody
knew
that
bob
pretty
got
eye
on
that
gold
watch
and
when
they
did
they
could
believe
it
they
give
bob
credit
for
too
much
sense
to
waste
time
over
wot
they
knew
could
get
but
arter
they
heard
one
or
two
things
they
got
alarmed
and
pretty
near
the
whole
village
went
up
to
see
bunnett
and
tell
about
bob
true
character
bunnett
could
believe
at
fast
but
arter
they
told
of
bob
poaching
and
the
artful
ways
and
tricks
he
of
getting
money
as
did
belong
to
began
to
think
different
he
spoke
to
parson
about
and
arter
that
said
he
never
wanted
for
to
see
bob
pretty
face
again
was
a
fine
about
it
up
at
this
cauliflower
that
night
and
the
quietest
man

whole
lot
was
bob

he
sat
still
all
the
time
drinking
beer
and
smiling
at

giving
good
advice
to
get
that
gold
watch
no
good
to
me

which
they
began
for
to
a

and

round

to

bob
pretty
with
the
next
three
or
four
weeks
bob
pretty
seemed
to
keep
very
quiet
and
we
all
began
to
think
as
he
made
a
mistake
for
once
everybody
else
was
trying
their
for
the
watch
and
all
bob
done
was
to
make
a
laugh
of
and
to
say
he
believed
it
was
made
of
brass
arter
all
then
one
arternoon
just
a
few
days
afore
time
was
up
at
the
farm

out
for
a
walk

and
i
thought
a
little
fresh

bunnett
just
looked
at
him
and
then
passed
by
without
a
word
wanted
to
ask
your
advice
about

turning
round
and
follering

up

the

as

the
landlord
put
in
outside
for
it
it
did
do
bob
pretty
the
good
it
ought
to
ha
the
bequest
robert
clarkson
sat
by
his
fire
smoking
thoughtfully
his
lifelong
neighbour
and
successful
rival
in
love
had
passed
away
a
few
days
before
and
clarkson
fresh
from
the
obsequies
sat
musing
on
the
fragility
of
man
and
the
inconvenience
that
sometimes
attended
his
departure
his
meditations
were
disturbed
by
a
low
knocking
on
the
front
door
which
opened
on
to
the
street
in
response
to
his
invitation
it
opened
slowly
and
a
small
man
of
doleful
aspect
entered
softly
and
closed
it
behind
him
bob
he
said
in
stricken
accents
thought
i
just
step
round
to
see
how
you
was
bearing
up
fancy
pore
old
phipps
why
as
soon
it
had
been
me
clarkson
nodded
and
gone
continued
smithson
taking
a
seat
well
so
you
have
her
at
was
his
wish
said
clarkson
in
a
dull
voice
very
generous
of
him
too
said
smithson
is
saying
so
certainly
he
could
take
her
away
with
him
how
long
is
it
since
you
was
both
of
you
courting
her
years
come
june
replied
the
other
what
waiting
does
and
patience
commented
smithson
you
been
like
some
chaps
and
gone
abroad
where
would
you
have
been
now
where
would
have
been
the
reward
of
your
faithful
heart
clarkson
whose
pipe
had
gone
out
took
a
coal
from
the
fire
and
lit
it
again
ca
understand
him
dying
at
his
age
he
said
darkly
ought
to
have
lived
to
ninety
if
he
been
taken
care
he
gone
pore
chap
said
his
friend
a
blessing
it
must
ha
been
to
him
in
his
last
moments
to
think
that
he
had
made
provision
for
his
exclaimed
clarkson
he
left
her
nothing
but
the
furniture
and
fifty
pounds
insurance
money
nothing
in
the
smithson
fidgeted
mean
you
he
said
staring
said
the
other
yes
yes
of
he
does
want
you
to
eat
your
heart
out
in
waiting
said
smithson
mind
about
me
he
said
to
her
go
and
make
bob
happy
wonderful
pretty
girl
she
used
to
be
did
she
clarkson
assented
i
no
doubt
she
looks
the
same
to
you
as
ever
she
did
pursued
the
sentimental
smithson
the
extraordinary
part
of
clarkson
turned
and
eyed
him
removed
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
after
hesitating
a
moment
replaced
it
with
a
jerk
says
she
rather
be
faithful
to
his
memory
continued
the
persevering
smithson
his
wishes
are
her
law
she
said
so
to
my
missis
only
she
ought
to
be
considered
said
clarkson
shaking
his
head
think
that
somebody
ought
to
put
it
to
her
she
has
got
her
feelings
poor
thing
and
if
she
would
rather
not
marry
again
she
ought
to
be
compelled
what
my
missis
did
say
to
her
said
the
other
she
did
pay
much
attention
she
said
it
was
henry
wish
and
she
did
care
what
happened
to
her
now
he
gone
besides
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
what
else
is
she
to
do
do
you
worry
bob
you
wo
lose
her
clarkson
staring
at
the
fire
mused
darkly
for
thirty
years
he
had
played
the
congenial
part
of
the
disappointed
admirer
but
faithful
friend
he
had
intended
to
play
it
for
at
least
fifty
or
sixty
he
wished
that
he
had
had
the
strength
of
mind
to
refuse
the
bequest
when
the
late
phipps
first
mentioned
it
or
taken
a
firmer
line
over
the
congratulations
of
his
friends
as
it
was
little
molton
quite
understood
that
after
thirty
years
waiting
the
faithful
heart
was
to
be
rewarded
at
last
public
opinion
seemed
to
be
that
the
late
phipps
had
behaved
with
extraordinary
generosity
rather
late
in
life
for
me
to
begin
said
clarkson
at
last
late
than
never
said
the
cheerful
smithson
something
seems
to
tell
me
that
i
ai
long
for
this
world
continued
clarkson
eyeing
him
with
some
disfavour
and
nonsense
said
smithson
lose
all
them
ideas
as
soon
as
you
married
you
have
somebody
to
look
after
you
and
help
you
spend
your
clarkson
emitted
a
dismal
groan
and
clapping
his
hand
over
his
mouth
strove
to
make
it
pass
muster
as
a
yawn
it
was
evident
that
the
malicious
smithson
was
deriving
considerable
pleasure
from
his
discomfiture
the
pleasure
natural
to
the
father
of
seven
over
the
troubles
of
a
comfortable
bachelor
clarkson
anxious
to
share
his
troubles
with
somebody
came
to
a
sudden
and
malicious
determination
to
share
them
with
smithson
do
want
anybody
to
help
me
spend
my
money
he
said
slowly
and
last
i
saved
a
tidy
bit
i
got
this
house
those
three
cottages
in
turner
lane
and
pretty
near
six
hundred
pounds
in
the
smithson
eyes
glistened
had
thought
it
had
occurred
to
me
said
clarkson
trying
to
keep
as
near
the
truth
as
possible
leave
my
property
to
a
friend
o
mine
a
man
with
a
large
family
however
it
no
use
talking
about
that
now
it
too
who
was
it
inquired
his
friend
trying
to
keep
his
voice
steady
clarkson
shook
his
head
no
good
talking
about
that
now
george
he
said
eyeing
him
with
sly
enjoyment
shall
have
to
leave
everything
to
my
wife
now
after
all
perhaps
it
does
more
harm
than
good
to
leave
money
to
said
smithson
sharply
was
it
george
said
clarkson
softly
said
the
other
with
a
gasp
he
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
seizing
the
other
hand
shook
it
fervently
ought
to
have
told
you
george
said
clarkson
with
great
satisfaction
only
make
you
miserable
it
just
one
o
the
might
ha
smithson
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
his
hands
twisted
behind
him
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
in
thought
rather
cool
of
phipps
he
said
after
a
long
silence
cool
i
think
to
go
out
of
the
world
and
just
leave
his
wife
to
you
to
look
after
some
men
would
stand
it
you
too
bob
that
what
the
matter
with
clarkson
sighed
get
took
advantage
of
added
his
friend
all
very
well
to
talk
said
clarkson
what
can
i
do
i
ought
to
have
spoke
up
at
the
time
it
too
late
i
was
you
said
his
friend
very
earnestly
did
want
to
marry
her
i
should
tell
her
so
say
what
you
like
it
ai
fair
to
her
you
know
it
ai
fair
to
the
pore
woman
she
never
forgive
you
if
she
found
it
taking
it
for
granted
said
the
other
everybody
look
after
their
own
business
said
smithson
tartly
look
here
bob
suppose
i
get
you
out
of
this
business
how
am
i
to
be
sure
you
leave
your
property
to
me
not
that
i
want
it
suppose
you
altered
your
will
you
get
me
out
of
it
every
penny
i
leave
will
go
to
you
said
clarkson
fervently
have
got
any
relations
and
it
do
matter
in
the
slightest
to
me
who
has
it
after
i
true
as
you
stand
there
demanded
the
other
eyeing
him
fixedly
true
as
i
stand
here
said
clarkson
smiting
his
chest
and
shook
hands
again
long
after
his
visitor
had
gone
he
sat
gazing
in
a
brooding
fashion
at
the
fire
as
a
single
man
his
wants
were
few
and
he
could
live
on
his
savings
as
the
husband
of
phipps
he
would
be
compelled
to
resume
the
work
he
thought
he
had
dropped
for
good
three
years
before
moreover
phipps
possessed
a
strength
of
character
that
had
many
times
caused
him
to
congratulate
himself
upon
her
choice
of
a
husband
slowly
but
surely
his
fetters
were
made
secure
two
days
later
the
widow
departed
to
spend
six
weeks
with
a
sister
but
any
joy
that
he
might
have
felt
over
the
circumstance
was
marred
by
the
fact
that
he
had
to
carry
her
bags
down
to
the
railway
station
and
see
her
off
the
key
of
her
house
was
left
with
him
with
strict
injunctions
to
go
in
and
water
her
geraniums
every
day
while
two
canaries
and
a
bullfinch
had
to
be
removed
to
his
own
house
in
order
that
they
might
have
constant
attention
and
company
doing
it
on
purpose
said
smithson
fiercely
binding
you
hand
and
clarkson
assented
gloomily
trusting
to
you
george
he
remarked
it
be
to
forget
to
water
the
geraniums
and
let
the
birds
die
because
they
missed
her
so
much
suggested
smithson
after
prolonged
thought
clarkson
shivered
would
be
a
hint
said
his
friend
clarkson
took
some
letters
from
the
mantelpiece
and
held
them
up
writes
about
them
every
day
he
said
briefly
i
have
to
answer
she
do
refer
to
your
getting
married
i
suppose
said
his
friend
anxiously
clarkson
said
but
her
sister
does
he
added
had
two
letters
from
smithson
got
up
and
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
women
all
over
he
said
bitterly
never
ask
for
things
straight
out
but
they
always
get
in
roundabout
ways
she
ca
do
it
herself
so
she
gets
her
sister
to
do
clarkson
groaned
her
sister
is
hinting
that
she
ca
leave
the
house
where
she
spent
so
many
happy
years
he
said
says
what
a
pleasant
surprise
it
would
be
for
phipps
if
she
was
to
come
home
and
find
it
done
means
you
got
to
live
there
when
you
married
said
his
friend
solemnly
clarkson
glanced
round
his
comfortable
room
and
groaned
again
asked
me
to
get
an
estimate
from
digson
he
said
dully
knows
as
well
as
i
do
her
sister
has
got
any
money
i
wrote
to
say
that
it
had
better
be
left
till
she
comes
home
as
i
might
not
know
what
was
smithson
nodded
approval
phipps
wrote
herself
and
thanked
me
for
being
so
considerate
continued
his
friend
grimly
says
that
when
she
comes
back
we
must
go
over
the
house
together
and
see
what
wants
smithson
got
up
and
walked
round
the
room
again
never
promised
to
marry
her
he
said
stopping
suddenly
said
the
other
all
been
arranged
for
me
i
never
said
a
word
i
could
tell
phipps
i
would
have
her
with
them
all
standing
round
and
him
thinking
he
was
doing
me
the
greatest
favour
in
the
she
ca
name
the
day
unless
you
ask
her
said
the
other
you
got
to
do
is
to
keep
quiet
and
not
commit
yourself
be
as
cool
as
you
can
and
just
before
she
comes
home
you
go
off
to
london
on
business
and
stay
there
as
long
as
clarkson
carried
out
his
instructions
to
the
letter
and
phipps
returning
home
at
the
end
of
her
visit
learned
that
he
had
left
for
london
three
days
before
leaving
the
geraniums
and
birds
to
the
care
of
smithson
from
the
hands
of
that
unjust
steward
she
received
two
empty
together
with
a
detailed
account
of
the
manner
in
which
the
occupants
had
effected
their
escape
and
a
bullfinch
that
seemed
to
be
suffering
from
torpid
liver
the
condition
of
the
geraniums
was
ascribed
to
worms
in
the
pots
frost
and
premature
decay
go
like
it
sometimes
said
smithson
when
they
do
nothing
will
save
phipps
thanked
him
very
kind
of
you
to
take
so
much
trouble
she
said
quietly
people
would
have
lost
the
cages
too
while
they
were
about
did
my
best
said
smithson
in
a
surly
voice
know
you
did
said
phipps
thoughtfully
i
am
sure
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
if
there
is
anything
of
yours
i
can
look
after
at
any
time
i
shall
be
only
too
pleased
when
did
you
say
clarkson
was
coming
back
do
know
said
smithson
promptly
might
be
away
a
month
and
then
again
he
might
be
away
six
it
all
depends
you
know
what
business
very
thoughtful
of
him
said
phipps
repeated
smithson
has
gone
away
for
a
time
out
of
consideration
for
me
said
the
widow
things
are
it
is
a
little
bit
awkward
for
us
to
meet
much
at
do
think
he
gone
away
for
that
at
all
said
the
other
bluntly
phipps
shook
her
head
you
do
know
him
as
well
as
i
do
she
said
fondly
has
gone
away
on
my
account
i
feel
smithson
screwed
his
lips
together
and
remained
silent
he
feels
that
it
is
right
and
proper
for
him
to
come
back
pursued
phipps
turning
her
eyes
upwards
will
come
he
has
left
his
comfortable
home
just
for
my
sake
and
i
shall
not
forget
smithson
short
dry
cough
meant
to
convey
incredulity
shall
not
do
anything
to
this
house
till
he
comes
back
said
phipps
expect
he
would
like
to
have
a
voice
in
it
he
always
used
to
admire
it
and
say
how
comfortable
it
was
well
well
we
never
know
what
is
before
smithson
repeated
the
substance
of
the
interview
to
clarkson
by
letter
and
in
the
lengthy
correspondence
that
followed
kept
him
posted
as
to
the
movements
of
phipps
by
dint
of
warnings
and
entreaties
he
kept
the
in
london
for
three
months
by
that
time
little
molton
was
beginning
to
talk
beginning
to
see
how
the
land
lays
said
smithson
on
the
evening
of
his
friend
return
if
you
keep
quiet
and
do
as
i
tell
you
she
begin
to
see
it
too
as
i
said
before
she
ca
name
the
day
till
you
ask
clarkson
agreed
and
the
following
morning
when
he
called
upon
phipps
at
her
request
his
manner
was
so
distant
that
she
attributed
it
to
following
business
worries
and
the
atmosphere
of
london
in
the
front
parlour
digson
a
small
builder
and
contractor
was
busy
whitewashing
thought
we
might
as
well
get
on
with
that
said
phipps
is
only
one
way
of
doing
whitewashing
and
the
room
has
got
to
be
done
digson
will
bring
up
some
papers
and
if
you
come
round
you
can
help
me
clarkson
hesitated
not
choose
yourself
he
said
at
last
what
i
told
her
said
digson
stroking
his
black
beard
please
you
will
be
sure
to
please
him
i
says
and
if
it
it
ought
clarkson
started
you
could
help
her
choose
he
said
sharply
digson
came
down
from
his
perch
what
i
said
he
replied
phipps
will
let
me
advise
her
i
make
this
house
so
she
know
it
before
i
done
with
digson
has
been
very
kind
said
phipps
reproachfully
at
all
said
the
builder
softly
i
can
do
to
make
you
happy
or
comfortable
will
be
a
pleasure
to
clarkson
started
again
and
an
odd
idea
sent
his
blood
dancing
digson
was
a
widower
phipps
was
a
widow
could
anything
be
more
suitable
or
desirable
let
him
choose
he
said
all
he
ought
to
be
a
good
phipps
after
a
faint
protest
gave
way
and
digson
smiling
broadly
mounted
his
perch
again
clarkson
first
idea
was
to
consult
smithson
then
he
resolved
to
wait
upon
events
the
idea
was
fantastic
to
begin
with
but
if
things
did
take
such
a
satisfactory
turn
he
could
not
help
reflecting
that
it
would
not
be
due
to
any
efforts
on
the
part
of
smithson
and
he
would
no
longer
be
under
any
testamentary
obligations
to
that
enterprising
gentleman
by
the
end
of
a
week
he
was
jubilant
a
child
could
have
told
digson
intentions
and
phipps
was
anything
but
a
child
clarkson
admitted
cheerfully
that
digson
was
a
younger
and
man
than
himself
a
more
suitable
match
in
every
way
and
so
far
as
he
could
judge
phipps
seemed
to
think
so
at
any
rate
she
had
ceased
to
make
the
faintest
allusion
to
any
tie
between
them
he
left
her
one
day
painting
a
door
while
the
attentive
digson
guided
the
brush
and
walked
homewards
smiling
said
a
voice
behind
him
bignell
said
clarkson
when
is
it
to
be
inquired
his
friend
walking
beside
him
clarkson
frowned
is
what
to
be
he
demanded
disagreeably
bignell
lowered
his
voice
lose
her
if
you
ai
careful
he
said
my
words
ca
you
see
digson
little
game
clarkson
shrugged
his
shoulders
after
her
money
said
the
other
with
a
cautious
glance
around
said
the
other
with
an
astonished
laugh
she
has
got
illustration
be
riding
in
her
carriage
and
pair
in
six
all
right
said
bignell
know
best
of
course
i
was
just
giving
you
the
tip
but
if
you
know
better
why
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
she
be
riding
in
her
carriage
and
pair
in
six
months
anyhow
the
richest
woman
in
little
clarkson
stopped
short
and
eyed
him
in
perplexity
got
a
bit
sprung
one
night
and
told
me
said
bignell
do
know
it
herself
yet
uncle
on
her
mother
side
in
america
she
might
know
at
any
but
how
did
digson
know
inquired
the
astonished
clarkson
would
tell
me
was
the
reply
it
good
enough
for
him
what
do
you
think
he
after
her
and
mind
do
let
on
to
a
soul
that
i
told
he
walked
on
leaving
clarkson
standing
in
a
dazed
condition
in
the
centre
of
the
recovering
himself
by
an
effort
he
walked
slowly
away
and
after
prowling
about
for
some
time
in
an
aimless
fashion
made
his
way
back
to
phipps
house
he
emerged
an
hour
later
an
engaged
man
with
the
date
of
the
wedding
fixed
with
jaunty
steps
he
walked
round
and
put
up
the
banns
and
then
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
completed
a
successful
stroke
of
business
walked
homewards
little
molton
is
a
small
town
and
news
travels
fast
but
it
did
not
travel
faster
than
smithson
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
it
he
burst
into
clarkson
room
like
the
proverbial
hurricane
and
gasping
for
breath
leaned
against
the
table
and
pointed
at
him
an
incriminating
finger
you
been
running
said
clarkson
uneasily
what
what
do
you
mean
by
it
gasped
smithson
all
my
trouble
after
our
altered
my
mind
said
clarkson
with
dignity
said
the
other
in
time
said
clarkson
speaking
rapidly
day
and
i
believe
i
should
ha
been
too
late
it
took
me
pretty
near
an
hour
to
talk
her
over
said
i
been
neglecting
her
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
said
that
she
was
beginning
to
think
i
did
want
her
as
hard
a
job
as
ever
i
had
in
my
you
did
want
her
said
the
amazed
smithson
told
me
misunderstood
me
said
clarkson
coughing
jump
at
smithson
sat
staring
at
him
heard
he
said
at
last
with
an
effort
heard
that
digson
was
paying
her
clarkson
spoke
without
thought
he
was
only
after
her
money
he
said
severely
heavens
what
the
matter
smithson
who
had
sprung
to
his
feet
made
no
reply
but
stood
for
some
time
incapable
of
speech
is
the
matter
repeated
clarkson
you
well
smithson
swayed
a
little
and
sank
slowly
back
into
his
chair
again
too
hot
said
his
astonished
host
smithson
staring
straight
before
him
nodded
i
was
saying
resumed
clarkson
in
the
low
tones
of
confidence
was
after
her
money
of
course
her
money
do
make
any
difference
to
me
although
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
do
something
for
friends
like
you
it
from
an
uncle
in
america
on
her
mother
smithson
made
a
strange
moaning
noise
and
snatching
his
hat
from
the
table
clapped
it
on
his
head
and
made
for
the
door
clarkson
flung
his
arms
around
him
and
dragged
him
back
by
main
force
are
you
carrying
on
like
that
for
he
demanded
do
you
mean
by
it
returned
smithson
with
intense
bitterness
thought
digson
was
the
biggest
fool
in
the
place
and
i
find
i
made
a
mistake
so
have
you
he
opened
the
door
and
dashed
out
clarkson
with
a
strange
sinking
at
his
heart
watched
him
up
the
road
the
guardian
angel
illustration
lodger
was
standing
at
the
foot
o
ginger
bed
going
through

in
wapping
and
for
the
fust

plenty
o

and
nothing

they
was
like

then
in
a
little
down
poplar
way
one
night
they
fell
out
over
a
little
joke
ginger
played
on
sam
was
the
fust
drink
that
evening
and
sam
just
ordered
a
pot
beer
and
three
glasses
when
ginger
winked
at
the
landlord
and
offered
to
bet
sam
a
level
that
would
drink
off
that
pot
o
beer
without
taking
breath
the
landlord
held
the
money
and
old
sam
with
a
smile
on
face
just
taken
up
the
mug
when
he
noticed
the
odd
way
in
which
they
was
all
watching
him
twice
he
took
the
mug
up
and
put
it
down
agin
without
starting
and
asked
wot
the
little
game
was
but
they
laughed
he
took
it
up
the
third
time
and
started
and
he
just
got
about
through
when
ginger
turns
to
the
landlord
and
ses

as

and
arter
getting
rid
of
the
beer
in

there
the
mug
away
from

making
such
faces
that
they
was

told

till
ginger
and
peter
came
out
and
then
drawing
up
in
a
proud
way
he
told
their

and
wot
he
thought
about

back
to
breathe

same
air
as
you
ginger

think
i
want
to
be
suffocated
held
his
up
very
and
arter
looking
at
them
as
if
they
was
dirt
he
turned
round
and
walked
off
with
his
nose
in
the
air
to
spend
the
evening
by
temper
kept
him
up
for
a
time
but
arter
a
while
he
to
own
up
to
that
it
was
very
dull
and
the
later
it
got
the
more
he
thought
of
nice
warm
bed
the
more
thought
of
it
the
nicer
and
warmer
it
seemed
and
arter
a
struggle
between
his
pride
and
a

he
got
good
temper
back
agin
and
went
off
smiling

dark
when
got
there
and
arter
standing
listening
a
moment
to
ginger
and
peter
snoring
he
took
off
coat
and
sat
down
on
bed
to
take
boots
off
he
only
sat
down
for
a
flash
and
then
he
bent
down
and
hit
his
an
awful
smack
against
another
wot
just
started
up
to
see
wot
it
was
sitting

corner
to
be
out
of

cold
and
temper
and
the
hardness
of
the
floor
it
was
a
long
time
afore

get
to

he
dropped
off
at
last
and
it
seemed
to
that
he
only
just
closed
eyes
when
it
was
daylight
he
opened
one
eye
and
was
just
going
to
open

both
up
sharp
and
peep
through
eyelashes
the
lodger
was
standing
at
the
foot
o

going
through
pockets
and
then
arter
waiting
a
moment
and
a
look
round
he
went
through
peter

lay
still
mouse
while
the
lodger
out
o
the
room
with
boots
in
his
and
then
springing
up
follered
him
downstairs
caught
up
just
as
he
undone
the
front
door
and
catching
hold
of

the
back
o
the
neck
shook
till

tired
then
he
let

under

sharp
about

the

and
the

street
he
stopped
on
the
landing
to
put
the
money
in
a
belt
he
was
wearing
under
clothes
and
then
went
back
on
to
corner
and
went
to
sleep
with
one
eye
open
and
the
smile
that
had
been
on
his
face
for
years
shut
both
eyes
when

ginger
wake
up
and

when

started
to
put
their
clothes

steady
young
man

her
could

steadier
than

i
am
sighed
sharp
culpepper
nodded
worst
of
it
is
girls

like
steady
young
men
he
said
rumpling
his
thin
grey
hair
the
silly
part
of
you
was
always
steady
and
culpepper
married
you
said
the
young
man
culpepper
nodded
again
thought
i
was
and
that
came
to
the
same
thing
he
said
composedly
it
ai
for
me
to
say
but
she
had
an
idea
that
i
was
very
in
them
days
i
had
chestnutty
hair
she
burnt
a
piece
of
it
only
the
other
day
she
kept
for
thirty
illustration
a
very
faint
squeeze
in
return
decided
him
it
what
for
inquired
sharp
said
the
other
lowering
his
voice
i
want
one
thing
nowadays
she
generally
wants
another
and
the
things
she
wants
ai
the
things
i
sharp
shook
his
head
and
sighed
again
ai
talkative
enough
for
florrie
you
know
said
culpepper
regarding
him
can
talk
all
right
as
a
rule
retorted
sharp
ought
to
hear
me
at
the
debating
society
but
you
ca
talk
to
a
girl
who
does
talk
far
too
humble
continued
the
other
should
cheek
her
a
bit
now
and
then
let
see
you
got
some
spirit
chaff
no
good
said
the
young
man
restlessly
tried
it
only
the
other
day
i
called
her
saucy
little
kipper
and
the
way
she
went
on
anybody
would
have
thought
i
insulted
her
ca
see
a
joke
i
where
is
she
now
was
the
reply
because
i
here
said
sharp
it
had
been
jack
butler
she
have
been
down
fast
could
be
him
said
culpepper
i
wo
have
in
the
house
i
told
him
so
i
told
her
so
and
i
told
aunt
so
and
if

marries
without
my
leave
afore
she
thirty
she
loses
the
seven
hundred
pounds
father
left
her
you
got
plenty
of
time
ten
sharp
sitting
with
his
hands
between
his
knees
gazed
despondently
at
the
floor
a
lot
o
girls
would
jump
at
me
he
remarked
only
got
to
hold
up
my
little
finger
and
they
because
they
got
sense
said
culpepper
got
the
sense
to
prefer
steadiness
and
humdrumness
to
good
looks
and
dash
a
young
fellow
like
you
earning
a
week
can
do
without
good
looks
and
if
i
told
florrie
so
once
i
have
told
her
fifty
are
a
matter
of
taste
said
sharp
morosely
of
them
girls
i
was
speaking
about
just
now
yes
said
culpepper
hastily
look
here
you
go
on
a
different
tack
take
a
glass
of
ale
like
a
man
or
a
couple
o
glasses
smoke
a
cigarette
or
a
pipe
be
like
other
young
men
cut
a
dash
and
do
be
a
after
you
married
you
can
be
as
miserable
as
you
sharp
after
a
somewhat
lengthy
interval
thanked
him
my
birthday
next
wednesday
continued
culpepper
regarding
him
benevolently
round
about
seven
and
i
ask
you
to
stay
to
supper
that
give
you
a
chance
anybody
allowed
to
step
a
bit
over
the
mark
on
birthdays
and
you
might
take
a
glass
or
two
and
make
a
speech
and
be
so
happy
and
bright
that
they
know
you
if
you
want
an
excuse
for
calling
you
could
bring
me
a
box
of
cigars
for
my
come
in
to
wish
you
happy
returns
of
the
day
said
the
thrifty
sharp
do
forget
to
get
above
yourself
said
culpepper
regarding
him
sternly
a
gentlemanly
way
of
course
have
as
many
glasses
as
you
like
there
no
stint
about
it
ever
comes
off
said
sharp
rising
i
get
her
through
you
you
sha
have
reason
to
repent
it
i
look
after
culpepper
whose
feelings
were
a
trifle
ruffled
said
that
he
would
after
it
he
had
a
faint
idea
that
even
from
his
own
point
of
view
he
might
have
made
a
better
selection
for
his
niece
hand
sharp
smoked
his
first
cigarette
the
following
morning
and
encouraged
by
the
entire
absence
of
any
purchased
a
pipe
which
was
taken
up
by
a
policeman
the
same
evening
for
obstructing
the
public
footpath
in
company
with
a
metal
three
parts
full
in
the
matter
of
ale
he
found
less
difficulty
certainly
the
taste
was
unpleasant
but
treated
as
medicine
and
gulped
down
quickly
it
was
endurable
after
a
day
or
two
he
even
began
to
be
critical
and
on
monday
evening
went
so
far
as
to
complain
of
its
flatness
to
the
landlord
of
the
much
he
said
as
he
finished
his
glass
and
made
for
the
door
much
come
said
the
landlord
thickly
want
to
speak
to
the
expert
shook
his
head
and
passing
out
into
the
street
changed
colour
as
he
saw
miss
garland
approaching
in
a
blundering
fashion
he
clutched
at
his
hat
and
stammered
out
a
miss
garland
returned
the
greeting
and
instead
of
passing
on
stopped
and
with
a
friendly
smile
held
out
her
hand
sharp
shook
it
convulsively
are
just
the
man
i
want
to
see
she
exclaimed
and
i
have
been
talking
about
you
all
the
sharp
said
i
do
want
uncle
to
see
us
pursued
miss
garland
in
the
low
tones
of
confidence
way
shall
we
go
sharp
brain
reeled
all
ways
were
alike
to
him
in
such
company
he
walked
beside
her
like
a
man
in
a
dream
want
to
give
him
a
lesson
said
the
girl
presently
lesson
that
he
will
said
the
young
man
explained
the
girl
a
shocking
thing
a
wicked
thing
to
try
and
upset
a
steady
young
man
like
you
aunt
is
quite
put
out
about
it
and
i
feel
the
same
as
she
gasped
the
astonished
sharp
did
you
heard
him
said
miss
garland
was
just
going
into
the
room
when
she
caught
a
word
or
two
and
she
stayed
outside
and
listened
you
do
know
what
a
lot
she
thinks
of
sharp
eyes
opened
wider
than
ever
thought
she
did
like
me
he
said
slowly
gracious
said
miss
garland
could
have
put
such
an
idea
as
that
into
your
head
of
course
aunt
is
always
going
to
let
uncle
see
that
she
agrees
with
him
still
as
if
anybody
could
help
she
murmured
to
herself
said
the
young
man
in
a
trembling
voice
miss
garland
walked
along
with
averted
face
sharp
his
pulses
bounding
trod
on
air
beside
her
thought
he
said
at
last
thought
that
jack
butler
was
a
favourite
of
hers
butler
said
the
girl
in
tones
of
scornful
surprise
idea
how
blind
men
are
you
all
alike
i
think
you
ca
see
two
inches
in
front
of
you
she
as
pleased
as
possible
that
you
are
coming
on
wednesday
and
so
am
sharp
caught
his
breath
he
murmured
go
down
here
said
miss
garland
quickly
by
the
river
and
i
tell
you
what
we
want
you
to
she
placed
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
and
sharp
with
a
tremulous
smile
obeyed
the
smile
faded
gradually
as
he
listened
and
an
expression
of
anxious
astonishment
took
its
place
he
shook
his
head
as
she
proceeded
and
twice
ventured
a
faint
suggestion
that
she
was
only
speaking
in
jest
convinced
at
last
against
his
will
he
walked
on
in
silent
consternation
he
said
at
last
as
miss
garland
paused
for
breath
uncle
would
never
forgive
me
he
never
let
me
come
near
the
house
will
see
to
that
said
the
girl
confidently
of
course
if
you
do
wish
to
please
me
she
turned
away
and
sharp
plucking
up
spirit
ventured
to
take
her
hand
and
squeeze
it
a
faint
a
very
faint
squeeze
in
return
decided
him
will
come
all
right
afterwards
said
miss
garland
with
the
hold
it
will
give
aunt
over
hope
so
said
the
young
man
not
i
shall
be
far
farther
off
than
miss
garland
blushed
and
turning
her
head
gazed
steadily
at
the
river
me
she
said
at
last
and
sharp
said
that
so
long
as
he
pleased
her
nothing
else
mattered
and
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
paced
slowly
along
the
towpath
by
her
side
you
must
mind
what
auntie
and
i
say
to
you
said
the
girl
continuing
her
instructions
must
keep
up
appearances
you
know
and
if
we
seem
to
be
angry
you
must
remember
we
are
only
sharp
with
a
tender
smile
said
that
he
understood
perfectly
now
i
had
better
go
said
florrie
returning
the
smile
might
see
us
together
or
somebody
else
might
see
us
and
tell
him
she
shook
hands
and
went
off
stopping
three
times
to
turn
and
wave
her
hand
in
a
state
of
bewildered
delight
sharp
continued
his
stroll
rehearsing
as
he
went
the
somewhat
complicated
and
voluminous
instructions
she
had
given
him
by
wednesday
evening
he
was
and
in
a
state
of
mind
divided
between
nervousness
and
exaltation
set
out
for
culpepper
he
found
that
gentleman
dressed
in
his
best
sitting
in
an
with
his
hands
folded
over
a
fancy
waistcoat
of
startling
design
and
placing
a
small
box
of
small
cigars
on
his
knees
wished
him
the
usual
the
entrance
of
the
ladies
who
seemed
as
though
they
had
just
come
off
the
ice
interrupted
culpepper
thanks
spoiled
that
what
i
am
he
remarked
playfully
this
waistcoat
my
old
aunt
elizabeth
sent
it
this
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
glanced
down
in
warm
approval
missis
gave
me
a
pipe
and
florrie
gave
me
half
a
pound
of
tobacco
and
i
bought
a
bottle
of
port
wine
myself
for
all
of
he
pointed
to
a
bottle
that
stood
on
the
and
the
ladies
retiring
to
the
kitchen
to
bring
in
the
supper
rose
and
placed
chairs
a
piece
of
roast
beef
was
placed
before
him
and
motioning
sharp
to
a
seat
opposite
florrie
he
began
to
carve
a
nice
comfortable
party
he
said
genially
as
he
finished
yourself
to
the
ale
sharp
ignoring
the
surprise
on
the
faces
of
the
ladies
complied
and
passed
the
bottle
to
culpepper
they
drank
to
each
other
and
again
a
flicker
of
surprise
appeared
on
the
faces
of
culpepper
and
her
niece
culpepper
noticing
it
shook
his
head
waggishly
at
sharp
drinks
it
as
if
he
likes
it
he
remarked
do
asserted
sharp
and
raising
his
glass
emptied
it
and
resumed
the
attack
on
his
plate
culpepper
unscrewed
the
top
of
another
bottle
and
the
reckless
sharp
after
helping
himself
made
a
short
and
feeling
speech
in
which
he
wished
culpepper
long
life
and
happiness
you
ai
happy
with
culpepper
he
concluded
gallantly
ought
to
culpepper
nodded
and
went
on
eating
in
silence
until
the
keen
edge
of
his
appetite
having
been
taken
off
he
put
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
waxed
sentimental
married
over
thirty
years
he
said
slowly
with
a
glance
at
his
wife
never
regretted
has
inquired
sharp
me
returned
the
surprised
culpepper
sharp
who
had
just
raised
his
glass
put
it
down
again
and
smiled
it
was
a
faint
smile
but
it
seemed
to
affect
his
host
unfavourably
are
you
smiling
at
he
demanded
said
sharp
exchanging
a
covert
glance
with
florrie
you
told
me
the
other
culpepper
looked
bewildered
give
you
a
penny
for
them
thoughts
he
said
with
an
air
of
jocosity
sharp
shook
his
head
could
buy
he
said
with
owlish
solemnity
especially
after
the
good
supper
you
giving
said
culpepper
uneasily
as
his
wife
sat
somewhat
erect
it
my
birthday
and
i
do
grudge
nothing
to
nobody
but
go
easy
with
the
beer

culpepper
sharp
stared
at
him
i
said

he
inquired
culpepper
shook
his
head
and
taking
up
a
fork
and
spoon
began
to
serve
a
that
miss
garland
had
just
placed
on
the
table
was
it
you
said
i
was
to
be
sure
and
not

inquired
sharp
dreamily

the
harassed
culpepper
laying
down
the
fork
and
spoon
and
regarding
him
ferociously
mean
there
was
anything

did
say

i
sorry
persisted
sharp
ca
say
fairer
than
that

all
right
said
culpepper
trying
but
in
vain
to
exchange
a
waggish
glance
with
his
wife
did
say
it
inquired
sharp
said
culpepper
still
smiling
in
a
wooden
fashion
mean
the
other
thing
said
sharp
in
a
thrilling
whisper
here
exclaimed
the
overwrought
culpepper
not
eat
your
pudding
and
leave
off
talking
nonsense
nobody
listening
to
for
yourself
said
his
wife
tartly
like
to
hear
sharp
talk
what
was
it
he
told
you
not
to
tell
me
sharp
eyed
her
mistily
i
ca
tell
you
he
said
slowly
not
asked
culpepper
coaxingly
it
it
would
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
said
the
industrious
sharp
said
culpepper
sharply
said
it
would
said
sharp
indicating
his
host
with
his
spoon
he
ought
to
know
who
that
kicking
me
under
the
table
culpepper
shivering
with
wrath
and
dread
struggled
for
speech
better
get
home
bert
he
said
at
last
not
yourself
there
nobody
kicking
you
under
the
table
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
you
been
dreaming
things
i
never
said
anything
of
the
gone
said
sharp
shaking
his
head
at
him
gone
do
you
remember
roared
culpepper
sharp
sat
blinking
at
him
but
his
misgivings
vanished
before
the
glances
of
admiring
devotion
which
miss
garland
was
sending
in
his
direction
he
construed
them
rightly
not
only
as
a
reward
but
as
an
incentive
to
further
efforts
in
the
midst
of
an
impressive
silence
culpepper
collected
the
plates
and
producing
a
dish
of
fruit
from
the
sideboard
placed
it
upon
the
table
yourself
sharp
she
said
pushing
the
bottle
of
port
towards
him
sharp
complied
having
first
after
several
refusals
put
a
little
into
the
ladies
glasses
and
a
lot
on
the
tablecloth
near
culpepper
then
after
a
satisfying
sip
or
two
he
rose
with
a
bland
smile
and
announced
his
intention
of
making
a
speech
you
made
one
said
his
host
in
tones
of
fierce
expostulation
that
was
las
night
said
sharp
is
your
we
do
want
any
more
said
culpepper
sharp
hesitated
only
his

he
continued
turning
to
his

culpepper
very
anxious
he

said
his
wife
sharply
i

culpepper
he
talking
sharp
still
on
his
legs
took
another
sip
of
port
and
avoiding
the
eye
of
culpepper
which
was
showing
signs
of
incipient
inflammation
looked
for
encouragement
to
miss
garland
a
man
we
all

up
to
and
respect
he
continued
he
does
go
off
to
london
every
now
and
then
on
business
that
his
lookout
my
idea
is
he
always
ought
to
take
culpepper
with
him
have
pleasure
of
her
company
and

time
he
be
money
in
pocket
by
it
and
why
should
she
go

sometimes
why
she
get
off

said
the
purple
culpepper
rising
and
hammering
the
table
with
his
fist
off
home
and
if
you
so
much
as
show
your
face
inside
this
again
there

sitting
down
suddenly
go
home
till
we
soon
see
about
that
said
culpepper
taking
him
by
the
shoulders
on
sharp
subsided
lumpishly
into
his
chair
and
culpepper
despite
his
utmost
efforts
failed
to
move
him
the
two
ladies
exchanged
a
glance
and
then
with
their
heads
in
the
air
sailed
out
of
the
room
the
younger
pausing
at
the
door
to
bestow
a
mirthful
glance
upon
sharp
ere
she
disappeared
out
said
culpepper
panting
trying
to
tickle
me
inquired

doing
nothing
but
make
mischief
ever
since
you

such
things

your
silly
head
i
do
know
i
shall
never
hear
the
end
of
as
long
as
i
head
repeated
sharp
with
an
alarming
change
of
manner
it
culpepper
repeated
it
with
gusto
good
said
sharp
he
seized
him
suddenly
and
pushing
him
backwards
into
his
easychair
stood
over
him
with
such
hideous
contortions
of
visage
that
culpepper
was
horrified
you
sit
there
and
keep
quite
still
he
said
with
smouldering
ferocity
did
you
put
eh
where
no
bert
said
culpepper
clutching
at
his
sleeve
i
was
only
joking
you
you
ai
quite
yourself
demanded
the
other
rolling
his
eyes
and
clenching
his
fists
i
mean
you
improved
said
culpepper
hurriedly
you
sharp
countenance
cleared
a
little
make
a
night
of
it
he
said
move
whatever
you
illustration
he
felt
the
large
and
clumsy
hand
of
butler
take
him
by
the
collar
he
closed
the
door
and
putting
the
wine
and
a
couple
of
glasses
on
the
mantelpiece
took
a
chair
by
culpepper
and
prepared
to
spend
the
evening
his
instructions
were
too
specific
to
be
disregarded
and
three
times
he
placed
his
arm
about
the
waist
of
the
frenzied
culpepper
and
took
him
for
a
lumbering
dance
up
and
down
the
room
in
the
intervals
between
dances
he
regaled
him
with
interminable
extracts
from
speeches
made
at
the
debating
society
and
recitations
learned
at
school
suggestions
relating
to
bed
thrown
out
by
culpepper
from
time
to
time
were
repelled
with
scorn
and
twice
in
deference
to
desires
he
had
to
join
in
the
chorus
of
a
song
ten
passed
and
the
hands
of
the
clock
crawled
round
to
eleven
the
hour
struck
and
as
though
in
answer
the
door
opened
and
the
agreeable
face
of
florrie
garland
appeared
behind
her
to
the
intense
surprise
of
both
gentlemen
loomed
the
stalwart
figure
of
jack
butler
thought
he
might
be
useful
uncle
said
miss
garland
coming
into
the
room
would
let
me
come
down
sharp
rose
in
a
dazed
fashion
and
saw
culpepper
grasp
butler
by
the
hand
more
dazed
still
he
felt
the
large
and
clumsy
hand
of
butler
take
him
by
the
collar
and
propel
him
with
some
violence
along
the
small
passage
while
another
hand
which
he
dimly
recognized
as
belonging
to
culpepper
was
inserted
in
the
small
of
his
back
then
the
front
door
opened
and
he
was
thrust
out
into
the
night
the
door
closed
and
a
low
feminine
laugh
sounded
from
a
window
above
illustration
tell
you
i
am
as
innercent
as
a
babe
skilled
assistance
the
who
had
left
his
seat
on
the
jetty
to
answer
the
came
back
with
disgust
written
on
a
countenance
only
too
well
designed
to
express
it
she
been
up
once
in
the
last
week
to
know
whether
the
is
up
she
been
four
or
five
times
he
growled
if
he
a
day
left
leg
is
shorter
than
right
and
he
talks
with
a
stutter
when
she
with
you
think
as
butter
would
melt
in
mouth
but
the
way
she
talked
to
me
just
now
think
i
was
paid
to
wait
on
her
i
asked
at
last
wot
she
thought
i
was
here
for
and
she
said
she
did
know
and
nobody
else
neither
and
afore
she
went
off
she
told
the
potman
from
the
wot
was
listening
that
i
was
known
all
over
wapping
as
the
sleeping
beauty
ai
the
fust
i
words
with
not
by
a
lot
they
all
the
same
they
all
start
in
a
nice
kind
soapy
sort
o
way
and
as
soon
as
they
do
get
wot
they
want
fly
into
a
temper
and
ask
me
who
i
think
i
am
i
told
one
woman
once
not
to
be
silly
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
as
long
as
i
for
all
i
know
she
wearing
a
bit
o
my
in
a
locket
to
this
day
and
very
likely
boasting
that
i
gave
it
to
her
of
her
reminds
me
of
another
woman
there
was
a
pinner
used
to
trade
between
and
hull
on
a
schooner
named
the
snipe
nice
little
craft
she
was
and
was
a
very
nice
feller
many
and
many
the
pint
we
together
turn
and
and
the
time
we
ever
a
cross
word
was
when
somebody
hid
his
clay
pipe
in
my
beer
and
was
foolish
enough
to
think
i
done
it
a
nice
little
cottage
told
me
about
near
hull
and
wife
father
a
man
of
pretty
near
seventy
lived
with
the
old
man
was
and
as
she
was
his
only
daughter
they
looked
to
all
his
money
when
he
gorn
their
only
fear
was
that
might
marry
agin
and
judging
from
wot
used
to
tell
me
about
the
old
man
i
thought
it
more
than
likely
it
was
for
my
missis

ha
been
married
over

one
day

though

or

for
that
old
man
to
get
into
trouble
skipper
told
me
about

ten
minutes
arter
they
was
made
snug
in

crazy
when

a
difficult
job
at
the
best
o
times
and
i
sat
there
on
the
skylight
shivering
and
wondering
whether
the
skipper
or
muffit
would
turn
up
fust
seemed
to
pass
away
and
then
i
see
the
wicket
in
the
gate
open
and
the
skipper
come
through
he
jumped
on

without
a

he
stepped
on
to
the
wharf
and

just
moving
to
the

follering
when

colour
of

and
you

her
breath
fifty
yards
away

i
got
a
bad
memory
so
i
left

a
deep
breath
i
thought

life
and
i
was
going

so
fixing
my
eyes
on

just
stepped
back
a
bit
ready
for
so
long
as
i
kept
my
eye
fixed
on
she
could
do
anything
i
knew
that
unfortunately
i
stepped
back
just
a
inch
too
far
and
next
moment
i
went
over
in
twelve
foot
of
water
all
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
have
to
me

stopped

gently
pushing
the
swing
doors
of
the
public
bar
of
the
an
inch
apart
applied
an
eye
to
the
aperture
in
the
hope
of
discovering
a
moneyed
friend
his
gaze
fell
on
the
only
man
in
the
bar
a
greybeard
of
sixty
whose
face
and
rough
clothing
spoke
of
the
sea
with
a
faint
sigh
he
widened
the
opening
and
passed
through
ben
he
said
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness
a
drop
with
me
said
the
other
heartily

money
about

shook
his
head
and
his
face
fell
clearing
somewhat
as
the
other
handed
him
his
mug
it
all
up
george
he
said
his
friend
complied
a
more
tactful
man
might
have
taken
longer
over
the
job
but
benjamin
davis
who
appeared
to
be
labouring
under
some
strong
excitement
took
no
notice
had
a
shock
george
he
said
regarding

steadily

i
had
enough
of
it
awful
temper

that
wotton
took
up
the
mug
and
after
satisfying
himself
as
to
the
absence
of

put
it
down
again
and
yawned

worry
about

remarked

likely
to

and
if

gave
vent
to
a
contemptuous
laugh
much
he
repeated
her
what

old
shipmate
of

this
morning

davis
raising
his
voice

and
when

afterwards

davis
pondered
for
some
time
in
sulky
silence
it
would
be
as
well
he
said
at
last
i
stand
no
nonsense
you
like
i
come
with

said
wotton
ai
got
nothing
to
do
i
could
tell
i
was
cast
away
with
you
if
you
liked
anything
to
help
a
davis
took
two
inches
of
soiled
clay
pipe
from
his
pocket
and
puffed
thoughtfully
can
come
he
said
at
last
you
only
got
a
copper
or
two
we
could
ride
it
down
clapham
wotton
smiled
feebly
and
after
going
carefully
through
his
pockets
shook
his
head
and
followed
his
friend
outside
wonder
whether
she
be
pleased
he
remarked
as
they
walked
slowly
along
might
be
women
are
funny
creatures
so
faithful
i
knew
one
whose
husband
used
to
knock
about
dreadful
and
after
he
died
she
was
so
true
to
his
memory
she
would
marry
davis
grunted
and
with
a
longing
eye
at
the
omnibuses
passing
over
london
bridge
asked
a
policeman
the
distance
to
clapham
mind
said
wotton
as
his
friend
uttered
an
exclamation
have
money
in
your
pocket
davis
face
brightened
a
watch
and
chain
too
he
said
smoke
your
cigar
of
a
sunday
said
wotton
have
a
and
a
glass
for
a
davis
almost
smiled
and
then
suddenly
remembering
his
wasted
twenty
years
shook
his
head
grimly
over
the
friendship
that
attached
itself
to
and
glasses
of
ale
and
said
that
there
was
plenty
of
it
about
more
friendship
than
glasses
of
ale
and
perhaps
at
clapham
they
inquired
the
way
of
a
small
boy
and
after
following
the
road
indicated
retraced
their
steps
cheered
by
a
faint
but
bloodthirsty
hope
of
meeting
him
again
a
friendly
baker
put
them
on
the
right
track
at
last
both
gentlemen
eyeing
the
road
with
a
mixture
of
concern
and
delight
it
was
a
road
of
trim
villas
each
with
a
front
garden
and
windows
at
the
gate
of
a
house
with
the
word
inscribed
in
huge
gilt
letters
on
the
fanlight
davis
paused
for
a
moment
uneasily
and
then
walking
up
the
path
followed
by
wotton
knocked
at
the
door
he
retired
a
step
in
disorder
before
the
apparition
of
a
maid
in
cap
and
apron
a
sharp
sounded
in
his
ears
and
the
door
closed
again
he
faced
his
friend
gasping
should
give
her
the
sack
first
thing
said
wotton
davis
knocked
again
and
again
the
maid
reappeared
and
after
surveying
them
through
the
glass
opened
the
door
a
little
way
and
parleyed
want
to
see
your
missis
said
davis
fiercely
for
demanded
the
girl
tell
said
davis
inserting
his
foot
just
in
time
tell
that
there
two
gentlemen
here
what
have
brought
news
of
her
husband
and
look
sharp
about
was
cast
away
with
said
wotton
a
desert
island
said
davis
he
pushed
his
way
in
followed
by
his
friend
and
a
head
that
had
been
leaning
over
the
banisters
was
suddenly
withdrawn
for
a
moment
he
stood
irresolute
in
the
tiny
passage
and
then
with
a
husband
boldness
he
entered
the
front
room
and
threw
himself
into
an
wotton
after
a
scared
glance
around
the
room
seated
himself
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
most
uncomfortable
chair
he
could
find
and
coughed
nervously
illustration
tell
that
there
two
gentlemen
here
what
have
brought
news
of
her
not
be
too
sudden
with
her
he
whispered
do
want
her
to
faint
or
anything
of
that
sort
do
let
know
who
you
are
at
first
let
her
find
it
out
for
davis
who
was
also
suffering
from
the
stiff
grandeur
of
his
surroundings
nodded
you
better
start
in
case
she
reckernizes
my
voice
he
said
slowly
it
in
strong
about
me
and
i
was
always
wondering
what
had
to
in
luck
that
wot
you
are
said
his
friend
enviously
only
seen
furniture
like
thiss
in
shop
windows
before
here
she
he
started
and
both
men
tried
to
look
at
their
ease
as
a
stiff
rustling
sounded
from
the
stairs
then
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
old
lady
with
white
hair
swept
into
the
room
and
stood
regarding
them
davis
unprepared
for
the
changes
wrought
by
years
stared
at
her
aghast
the
black
silk
dress
the
gold
and
huge
cameo
brooch
did
not
help
to
reassure
him
afternoon
said
wotton
in
a
thin
voice
the
old
lady
returned
the
greeting
and
crossing
to
a
chair
and
seating
herself
in
a
very

wotton
watching
closely
for
any
symptoms
of
fainting
years
years
much
against
his
left
young
and
handsome
wife

a
sea
and

a
desert

the
old

davis
with
his
hand
and
the
old

after
a
glance
at
that
gentleman
turned
to
wotton
again

on
that
island
for
longer
than
i
like
to
think
of
continued
wotton
who
had
a
wholesome
dread
of
dates
we
was
rescued
at
last
and
ever
since
then
he
has
been
hunting
high
and
low
for
his
very
interesting
murmured
the
old
lady
what
has
it
got
to
do
with
me
wotton
gasped
and
cast
a
helpless
glance
at
his
friend
ai
heard
his
name
yet
he
said
impressively
would
you
say
if
i
said
it
was
ben
davis
should
say
it
was
true
said
the
old
lady
promptly
true
said
wotton
catching
his
breath
painfully
i
may
die
the
desert
island
continued
the
old
lady
calmly
story
that
i
heard
was
that
he
went
off
like
a
cur
and
left
his
young
wife
to
do
the
best
she
could
for
herself
i
suppose
he
heard
since
that
she
has
come
in
for
a
bit
of
repeated
wotton
in
a
voice
that
he
fondly
hoped
expressed
artless
surprise
said
the
old
lady
i
suppose
he
sent
you
two
gentlemen
round
to
see
how
the
land
she
was
looking
full
at
davis
as
she
spoke
and
both
men
began
to
take
a
somewhat
sombre
view
of
the
situation
did
know
him
else
you
would
talk
like
that
said
wotton
do
suppose
you
know
if
you
was
to
see
him
do
suppose
i
should
said
the
other
you
reckernize
his
voice
said
davis
breaking
silence
at
last
wotton
held
his
breath
but
the
old
lady
merely
shook
her
head
thoughtfully
was
a
disagreeable
voice
when
his
wife
used
to
hear
it
she
said
at
last
when
it
was
wotton
glanced
at
his
friend
and
raising
his
eyebrows
slightly
gave
up
his
task
ha
been
faults
on
both
sides
said
davis
gruffly

his
hostess
raising
her
voice
illustration

awkwardly

in
her
turn
and
drew

wotton
meekly
your

the
old

davis
sternly
at

straight
in
the
talk

the
other
sharply

on
a
desert
island

wotton
pathetically
now

resumed
davis
back
to
he
hung
his
cap
on
a
vase
on
the
mantelpiece
that
reeled
under
the
shock
and
dropping
into
his
chair
again
crossed
his
legs
and
eyed
her
sternly
her
gaze
was
riveted
on
his
dilapidated
boots
she
looked
up
and
spoke
mildly
not
my
husband
she
said

a
mistake
i
think
you
had
better
said
davis
with
a
hard
laugh
and
do

best
of
reasons
was
the
reply
how
can
you
prove
that

wotton

said
davis
fixing
her
with
a
glittering
eye

remember
the
serpent

tattooed
on
my
leg
for
a
garter

said
the
old
lady
hastily
send
for
the
used
to
admire
it
said
davis
reproachfully

other
in
a
fierce
voice

for
the
police

davis
springing

his
feet

said
davis
taking
a
long
breath
so
you
been
and
got
married
again
you
that
your
love
for
your
husband
as
was
cast
away
while
trying
to

that
why
you
do
want

the
other
with
great
dignity

davis
passed
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
eyes
in
a
dazed
fashion
and
stared
at
her
is
somebody
passing
himself
off
as
me
he
demanded
if
he
is
i
you
both
up
for
but
davis
turned
and
looked
blankly
at
his
friend
wotton
met
his
gaze
with
dilated
eyes
say
you
recognize
me
as
your
wife
said
the
old
lady
said
davis
hotly
very
curious
said
the
other
but
are
you
sure

davis
thrust
his
face
close
to
hers
and
stared
hard
she
bore
his
scrutiny
without
flinching
positive
certain
said
davis
taking
a
breath
very
curious
said
the
old
lady
then
i
suppose
we
are
a
bit
alike

see
davis
being
away
i
looking
after
her
house
for
a
bit
my
name

to
be
davis
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
and
falling
back
a
step
stared
at
her
all
make
mistakes
urged
wotton
after
a
long
silence
ben
sight
ai
wot
it
used
to
be
he
strained
it
looking
out
for
a
sail
when
we
was
on
that
desert
when
she
be
back
inquired
davis
finding
his
voice
at
last
the
old
lady
affected
to
look
puzzled
i
thought
you
were
certain
that
i
was
your
wife
she
said
smoothly
mistake
said
davis
ruefully
years
is
a
long
time
and
people
change
a
bit
i
have
myself
for
one
thing
i
must
say
i
did
expect

repeated
the
other
quickly
that
i
mean
you
too
stout
said
davis
hurriedly
people
that
like
stoutness
that
is
my
wife
used
to
a
very
good
wotton
nodded
used
to
rave
about
it
on
that
des
will

inquired
davis
interrupting
him
smith
shook
her
head
ca
say
she
replied
moving
towards
the
door
she
off
holidaying
i
never
know
when
she

tell
her

i
certainly
said
davis
with
great
vehemence
come
in
a
week
time
and
see
if
she
might
be
away
for
months
said
the
old
lady
moving
slowly
to
the
passage
and
opening
the
street
door
she
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
stood
watching
them
through
the
glass
as
they
passed
disconsolately
into
the
street
then
she
went
back
into
the
parlour
and
standing
before
the
mantelpiece
looked
long
and
earnestly
into
the
mirror
davis
returned
a
week
later
alone
and
pausing
at
the
gate
glanced
in
dismay
at
a
bill
in
the
window
announcing
that
the
house
was
to
be
sold
he
walked
up
the
path
still
looking
at
it
and
being
admitted
by
the
trim
servant
was
shown
into
the
parlour
and
stood
in
a
dispirited
fashion
before
smith
back
yet
he
inquired
gruffly
the
old
lady
shook
her
head
what
is
that
bill
for
demanded
davis
jerking
his
thumb
towards
it
is
thinking
of
selling
the
house
said
smith
let
her
know
you
had
been
and
that
is
the
result

wo
comeback

see
her

inquired
davis
frowning
smith
shook
her
head
again
it
would
be
no
use

telling
you
she
said
she
has
got
is
her
own
and
the
law
wo
let
you
touch
a
penny
of
it
without
her
consent
you
must
have
treated
her
badly
why
did
you
leave
her
repeated
davis
why
because
she
hit
me
over
the
with
a
smith
tossed
her
head
you
remembering
that
for
years
she
said
forgetting
it
retorted
davis
suppose
she
had
a
hot
temper
said
the
old
lady
temper
said
the
other
he
leaned
forward
and
holding
his
chilled
hands
over
the
fire
stood
for
some
time
deep
in
thought
do
know
what
it
is
he
said
at
last
there
a
something
about
you
that
reminds
me
of
her
it
ai
your
voice
she
had
a
very
nice
voice
when
she
was
in
a
temper
and
it
ai
your
face

smith
sharply

me
of
yet
the
other
day

me
at
once

the
old
lady

davis

i
was
expecting
to
see
her
i
there
was
a
long
silence

smith
at

no
good
for
you
to

here
to
see
her
she

again
i
do
want

davis
in
a
startled
voice
wo

the
old
lady

if

should
happen
to

davis
with
his
hand
on
the
understand

she
known
wot

is
to
be
poor
herself
she
got
a
bad
temper
but
she
have
cut
her
tongue
out
afore
she
thrown
a
poor
devil
rags
in
his
face
ben
said
the
old
woman
in
a
changed
voice
davis
through
the
door
started
as
though
he
had
been
shot
and
facing
about
stood
eyeing
her
in
dumb
bewilderment
i
take
you
back
again
repeated
his
wife
you
going
to
behave
yourself
is
the
same
voice
and
it
is
the
same
face
said
the
old
woman
if
i
only
got
a
broomhandle
handy
davis
made
an
odd
noise
in
his
throat
you
had
been
so
down
on
your
luck
said
his
wife
blinking
her
eyes
rapidly
have
let
you
go

had
looked
miserable
i
could
have
stood

take
you

davis
stood
gaping
at
her
i
take
you
back
again
repeated
his
wife
speaking
very
slowly
you
going
to
behave
yourself

davis
finding
his
voice
at
last

old
man
of
the
sea

you
to

george
wright
as
he
leaned
towards
the
old
sailor
to
be
an
uncle
to

the
mystified
kemp
pausing
with
a
mug
of
beer
midway
to
his
lips
rich

the
young
man
lowering
his
voice
to
prevent
any
keen
ears
in
the
next
bar
from
acquiring
useless
knowledge
uncle
from
new
zealand
who
is
going
to
leave
me

demanded
kemp
with
a
little
excitement
ai
coming
was
the
reply
only
got
to
say
you
got
it
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
got
my
eye
on
a
young
lady
there
another
chap
after

and
if
she
thought

got
a
rich
uncle
it
might
make
all
the
difference
she
knows
i
an
uncle
that
went
to
new
zealand
and
was
never
heard
of
since
that
what
made
me
think
of
kemp
drank
his
beer
in
thoughtful
silence
can
i
be
a
rich
uncle
without
any
brass
he
inquired
at
length

a
little

george

said
candidly

he
ordered
some
more
beer
for
kemp
and
in
a
low
voice
gave
him
as
much
of
the
family
history
as
he
considered
necessary

known
you
for
about
ten
days
he
concluded
i
sooner
trust
you
than
people
i
known
for
took
a
fancy
to
you
the
moment
i
set
eyes
on
you
rejoined
kemp
the
living
image
of
a
young
fellow
that
lent
me
five
pounds
once
and
was
drowned
afore
my
eyes
the
week
after
he
a
bit
of
a
squint
and
i
that
how
he
came
to
fall
he
emptied
his
mug
and
then
accompanied
by
wright
fetched
his
from
the
where
he
was
staying
and
took
it
to
the
young
man
lodgings
fortunately
for
the
latter
pocket
the
chest
contained
a
good
best
suit
and
boots
and
the
only
expenses
incurred
were
for
a
large
soft
felt
hat
and
a
gilded
watch
and
chain
dressed
in
his
best
with
a
bulging

his
he
set
out
with
wright
on
the
following
evening
to
make
his
first
call

who
was
also
in
his
best
clothes
led
the
way
to
a
small
tobacconist
in
a
side
street
off
the
mile
end
road
and
raising
his
hat
with
some
ceremony
shook
hands
with
a
young
woman
who
stood
behind
the
counter
kemp
adopting
an
air
of
scornful
dignity
intended
to
indicate
the
possession
of
great
wealth
waited
is
my
uncle
said
wright
speaking
rapidly
new
zealand
the
one
i
spoke
to
you
about
he
turned
up
last
night
and
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
expected
to
kemp
in
a
good
rolling
voice
said
evening
miss
i
hope
you
are
well
and
subsiding
into
a
chair
asked
for
a
cigar
his
surprise
when
he
found
that
the
best
cigar
they
stocked
only
cost
sixpence
almost
assumed
the
dimensions
of
a
grievance
do
to
go
on
with
he
said
smelling
it
suspiciously
you
got
change
for
a
note
miss
bradshaw
concealing
her
surprise
by
an
effort
said
that
she
would
see
and
was
scanning
the
contents
of
a
drawer
when
kemp
in
some
haste
discovered
a
few
odd
sovereigns
in
his
five
minutes
later
he
was
sitting
in
the
little
room
behind
the
shop
holding
forth
to
an
admiring
audience
far
as
i
know
he
said
in
reply
to
a
question
of
bradshaw
is
the
only
relation
i
got
him
and
me
are
quite
alone
and
i
can
tell
you
i
was
glad
to
find
bradshaw
sighed
a
pity
you
are
so
far
apart
she
said
not
for
long
said
kemp
just
going
back
for
about
a
year
to
wind
up
things
out
there
and
then
i
coming
back
to
leave
my
old
bones
over
here
george

very
kindly
offered
to
let
me

bradshaw
archly
far
as

he
wo
said
the
old
man
that

make
any
difference
to

the
same
to
me

farthing

wright
promptly

to
go
on
with
he
said
kemp
somewhat
affected
shook
hands
with
him
and
leaning
back
in
the
most
comfortable
chair
in
the
room
described
his
life
and
struggles
in
new
zealand
hard
work
teetotalism
and
the
simple
life
combined
appeared
to
be
responsible
for
a
fortune
which
he
affected
to
be
too
old
to
enjoy
misunderstandings
of
a
painful
nature
were
avoided
by
a
timely
admission
that
under
medical
advice

was
now
taking
a
fair
amount
of
stimulant
illustration
much
did
you
say

got
in
the
bank
he
said
as
he
walked
home
with
the
elated
george

mine
and
it
sure
to
come
a
bit
expensive
i
ca

the
bank

said
wright
hastily
thing
is
they
ca
leave
the
shop
to
go
out
much
it
a
very
good
little
business
and
it
ought
to
be
all
right
for
me
and
bella
one
of
these
days
eh
kemp
prompted
by
a
nudge
in
the
ribs
assented
wonderful
how
they
took
it
all
in
about
me
he
said
i
feel
certain
in
my
own
mind
that
i
ought
to
chuck
some
money
of
the
money
you
have
chucked
about
said
wright
do
just
as
well
and
come
a
good
deal
cheaper
and
you
had
better
go
round
alone
evening
it
look
better
just
go
in
for
another
one
of
their
sixpenny
kemp
obeyed
and
the
following
evening
after
sitting
a
little
while
chatting
in
the
shop
was
invited
into
the
parlour
where
mindful
of
wright
instructions
he
held
his
listeners
enthralled
by
tales
of
past
expenditure
a
tip
of
fifty
pounds
to
his
bedroom
steward
coming
over
was
characterized
by
bradshaw
as
extravagant
to
be
going
all
right
said
wright
as
the
old
man
made
his
report
be
careful
do
go
overdoing
kemp
nodded
can
turn
round
my
little
finger
he
said
have
bella
all
to
yourself
wright
flushed
did
you
manage
that
he
inquired
the
first
time
she
has
ever
been
out
with
me

said
kemp
going
to
stay
at
home
and
mind
the
shop
it
the
mother
what

out
going
to
spend
the
evening
with
me
wright
frowned
did
you
do
that
for
he
demanded
hotly
did
do
it
said
kemp
equably
done
it
the
old
lady
says
that
just
for
once
in
her
life
she
wants
to
see
how
it
feels
to
spend
money
like
like
water
repeated
the
horrified
wright
like
i
her
i
do
matter
to
me
said
kemp
can
have
a
headache
or
a
chill
or
something
of
that
sort
if
you
like
i
do
want
to
go
no
pleasure
to
will
it
cost
demanded
wright
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
the
rich
uncle
made
a
calculation
wants
to
go
to
a
place
called
the
empire
he
said
slowly
have
something
for
supper
and
be
cabs
and
things
i
dessay
it
would
cost
a
couple
o
pounds
and
it
might
be
more
but
i
just
as
soon
ave
a
chill
wright
groaned
and
after
talking
of
bradshaw
as
though
she
were
already
his
produced
the
money
his
instructions
as
to
economy
lasted
almost
up
to
the
moment
when
he
stood
with
bella
outside
the
shop
on
the
following
evening
and
watched
the
couple
go
off
wonderful
how
well
they
get
on
together
said
bella
as
they
the
shop
and
passed
into
the
parlour
never
seen
mother
take
to
anybody
so
quick
as
she
has
to
hope
you
like
him
too
said
wright
a
dear
said
bella
having
all
that
money
i
wonder
what
it
feels
like
suppose
i
shall
know
some
day
said
the
young
man
slowly
it
wo
be
much
good
to
me
unless
said
bella
after
a
pause
it
gives
me
what
i
want
replied
the
other
sooner
be
a
poor
man
and
married
to
the
girl
i
love
than
a
miss
bradshaw
stole
an
uneasy
glance
at
his
somewhat
sallow
features
and
became
thoughtful
no
good
having
diamonds
and
and
that
sort
of
thing
unless
you
have
somebody
to
share
them
with
pursued
wright
miss
bradshaw
eyes
sparkled
and
at
that
moment
the
tinkled
and
a
lively
whistle
sounded
she
rose
and
went
into
the
shop
and
wright
settled
back
in
his
chair
and
scowled
darkly
as
he
saw
the
intruder
evening
said
the
latter
want
a
sixpenny
smoke
for
twopence
please
how
are
we
this
evening
sitting
up
and
taking
nourishment
miss
bradshaw
told
him
to
behave
himself
do
said
the
young
man
why
i
can
never
get
anybody
to
play
with
i
had
such
an
awful
dream
about
you
last
night
that
i
could
rest
till
i
saw
you
awful
it
was
it
inquired
miss
bradshaw
you
were
married
said
hills
smiling
at
her
miss
bradshaw
tossed
her
head
to
pray
she
inquired
said
hills
simply
woke
up
in
a
cold
perspiration
halloa
is
that
georgie
in
there
how
are
you
george
better
all
right
said
wright
with
dignity
as
the
other
hooked
the
door
open
with
his
stick
and
nodded
at
him
why
do
you
look
it
demanded
the
lively
hills
you
got
your
feet
wet
or
what
be
quiet
said
miss
bradshaw
smiling
at
him
said
hills
dropping
into
a
chair
by
the
counter
and
caressing
his
moustache
you
would
speak
to
me
like
that
if
you
knew
what
a
terrible
day
i
have
you
been
doing
asked
the
girl
said
the
other
with
a
huge
sigh
the
millionaire
i
came
round
on
purpose
to
have
a
look
at
and
mother
have
gone
to
the
empire
said
miss
bradshaw
hills
gave
three
long
penetrating
whistles
and
then
placing
his
cigar
with
great
care
on
the
counter
hid
his
face
in
a
huge
handkerchief
miss
bradshaw
glanced
from
him
to
the
frowning
wright
and
then
entering
the
parlour
closed
the
door
with
a
bang
hills
took
the
hint
and
with
a
somewhat
thoughtful
grin
departed
he
came
in
next
evening
for
another
cigar
and
heard
all
that
there
was
to
hear
about
the
empire
bradshaw
would
have
treated
him
but
coldly
but
the
innocent
kemp
charmed
by
his
manner
paid
him
great
attention
just
like
what
i
was
at
his
age
he
said
not
a
patch
on
you
said
hills
edging
his
way
by
slow
degrees
into
the
parlour
do
take
young
ladies
to
the
empire
were
you
telling
me
you
came
over
here
to
get
married
or
did
i
dream
it
at
him
said
the
blushing
kemp
as
bradshaw
shook
her
head
at
the
offender
and
told
him
to
behave
himself
a
man
any
woman
might
be
happy
with
said
hills
never
knows
how
much
there
is
in
his
fancy
sewing
on
buttons
for
a
man
like
that
ai
in
bradshaw
shook
her
head
at
him
again
and
hills
after
apologizing
to
her
for
revealing
her
innermost
thoughts
before
the
most
guileless
of
men
began
to
question
kemp
as
to
the
prospects
of
a
bright
and
energetic
young
man
with
a
distaste
for
work
in
new
zealand
the
audience
listened
with
keen
attention
to
the
replies
the
only
disturbing
factor
being
a
cough
of
wright
which
became
more
and
more
troublesome
as
the
evening
wore
on
by
the
time
uncle
and
nephew
rose
to
depart
the
latter
was
so
hoarse
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
did
you
tell
you
had
got
a
letter
calling
you
home
as
i
told
you
he
vociferated
as
soon
as
they
were
clear
of
the
shop
i
forgot
it
said
the
old
man
it
repeated
the
incensed
wright
did
you
think
i
was
coughing
like
that
for
fun
forgot
it
said
the
old
man
doggedly
if
you
take
my
advice
you
better
let
me
stay
a
little
longer
to
make
sure
of
wright
laughed
disagreeably
dare
say
he
said
i
am
managing
this
affair
not
you
now
you
go
round
afternoon
and
tell
them
you
off
d
hear
d
think
i
made
of
money
and
what
do
you
mean
by
making
such
a
fuss
of
that
fool
charlie
hills
you
know
he
is
after
he
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
home
in
indignant
silence
and
after
giving
minute
instructions
to
kemp
next
morning
at
breakfast
went
off
to
work
in
a
more
cheerful
frame
of
mind
kemp
was
out
when
he
returned
and
after
making
his
toilet
he
followed
him
to
bradshaw
to
his
annoyance
he
found
hills
there
again
and
moreover
it
soon
became
clear
to
him
that
kemp
had
said
nothing
about
his
approaching
departure
coughs
and
scowls
passed
unheeded
and
at
last
in
a
hesitating
voice
he
broached
the
subject
himself
there
was
a
general
chorus
of
lamentation
had
got
the
heart
to
tell
you
said
kemp
do
know
when
i
been
so
you
have
got
to
go
back
immediate
said
bradshaw
said
wright
before
the
old
man
could
reply
you
go
said
bradshaw
kemp
smiled
feebly
suppose
i
ought
to
he
replied
in
a
hesitating
voice
my
tip
and
give
yourself
a
bit
of
a
holiday
before
you
go
back
urged
hills
for
a
few
days
pleaded
bella
please
us
said
bradshaw
george
miss
hold
of
him
and
do
let
him
go
said
hills
he
took
kemp
round
the
waist
and
the
laughing
bella
and
her
mother
each
secured
an
arm
an
appeal
to
wright
to
secure
his
legs
passed
unheeded
do
let
you
go
till
you
promise
said
bradshaw
kemp
smiled
and
shook
his
head
said
bella
well
said
kemp
must
go
back
shouted
the
alarmed
wright
him
speak
for
himself
exclaimed
bella
indignantly
another
week
then
said
kemp
no
good
having
money
if
i
ca
please
week
shouted
wright
almost
beside
himself
with
rage
and
dismay
week
another
week
why
you
told
me
do
listen
to
him
said
bradshaw
it
his
own
business
ai
it
and
he
knows
best
do
he
what
it
got
to
do
with
you
she
patted
kemp
hand
kemp
patted
back
and
with
his
disengaged
hand
helped
himself
to
a
glass
of
beer
the
fourth
and
beamed
in
a
friendly
fashion
upon
the
company
he
said
suddenly
said
wright
in
a
harsh
voice
you
think
to
bring
my
along
with
you
said
wright
sharply
said
the
old
man
with
a
gesture
of
annoyance
lend
me
a
couple
of
pounds
then
or
else
run
back
and
fetch
my
he
added
with
a
sly
grin
wright
face
worked
with
impotent
fury
what
do
you
want
it
for
he
gasped
bradshaw
well
seemed
to
sum
up
the
general
feeling
kemp
shaking
his
head
eyed
him
with
gentle
reproach
and
bradshaw
are
going
to
gave
another
evening
out
he
said
quietly
only
got
a
few
more
days
and
i
must
make
hay
while
the
sun
to
wright
the
room
seemed
to
revolve
slowly
on
its
axis
but
regaining
his
by
a
supreme
effort
he
took
out
his
purse
and
produced
the
amount
bradshaw
after
a
few
feminine
protestations
went
upstairs
to
put
her
bonnet
on
you
can
go
and
fetch
a
george
while
she
of
it
said
kemp
out
a
good
if
you
wright
arose
and
departing
with
a
suddenness
that
was
almost
startling
exploded
harmlessly
in
front
of
the
barber
next
door
but
one
then
with
lagging
steps
he
went
in
search
of
the
shabbiest
cab
and
oldest
horse
he
could
find
my
boy
said
kemp
bluffly
as
he
helped
bradshaw
in
and
stood
with
his
foot
on
the
step
the
way
you
had
better
go
back
and
lock
my
up
i
left
it
on
the
washstand
and
there
best
part
of
a
thousand
pounds
in
it
you
can
take
fifty
for
yourself
to
buy
smokes
there
was
a
murmur
of
admiration
and
wright
with
a
frantic
attempt
to
keep
up
appearances
tried
to
thank
him
but
in
vain
long
after
the
cab
had
rolled
away
he
stood
on
the
pavement
trying
to
think
out
a
position
which
was
rapidly
becoming
unendurable
still
keeping
up
appearances
he
had
to
pretend
to
go
home
to
look
after
the
leaving
the
jubilant
hills
to
improve
the
shining
hour
with
miss
bradshaw
kemp
returning
home
at
midnight
in
a
cab
found
the
young
man
waiting
up
for
him
and
taking
a
seat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
listened
unmoved
to
a
of
himself
which
seemed
interminable
he
was
only
moved
to
speech
when
wright
described
him
as
a
jezebel
who
was
a
disgrace
to
his
sex
and
then
merely
in
the
interests
of
natural
science
you
worry
he
said
as
the
other
paused
from
exhaustion
wo
be
for
long
said
wright
panting
thing
morning
you
have
a
telegram
calling
you
back
a
telegram
that
must
be
minded
d
see
i
do
said
kemp
plainly
not
going
back
never
no
more
never
i
going
to
stop
here
and
court
wright
fought
for
breath
you
ca
he
gasped
going
to
have
a
try
said
the
old
man
sick
of
going
to
sea
and
it
be
a
nice
comfortable
home
for
my
old
age
you
marry
bella
and
i
marry
her
mother
happy
family
wright
trembling
with
rage
sat
down
to
recover
and
regaining
his
composure
after
a
time
pointed
out
almost
calmly
the
various
difficulties
in
the
way
thought
it
all
out
said
kemp
nodding
must
know
not
rich
till
after
we
married
then
i
a
letter
from
new
zealand
saying
i
lost
all
my
money
it
just
as
easy
to
have
that
letter
as
the
one
you
spoke
i
to
find
you
money
to
play
the
rich
uncle
with
till
married
i
suppose
said
wright
in
a
grating
voice
then
lose
bella
when
bradshaw
finds
you
lost
your
money
kemp
scratched
his
ear
your
lookout
he
said
at
last
look
here
said
wright
with
great
determination
you
go
and
tell
them
that
you
been
telegraphed
for
cabled
is
the
proper
word
or
i
tell
them
the
settle
you
then
said
kemp
more
than
the
other
would
retorted
the
young
man
it
come
cheaper
one
thing
i
take
my
oath
of
and
that
is
i
wo
give
you
another
farthing
but
if
you
do
as
i
tell
you
i
give
you
a
quid
for
luck
now
think
it
kemp
thought
it
over
and
after
a
vain
attempt
to
raise
the
promised
reward
to
five
pounds
finally
compounded
for
two
and
went
off
to
bed
after
a
few
stormy
words
on
selfishness
and
ingratitude
he
declined
to
speak
to
his
host
at
breakfast
next
morning
and
accompanied
him
in
the
evening
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
going
to
the
stake
he
listened
in
stony
silence
to
the
young
man
instructions
and
only
spoke
when
the
latter
refused
to
pay
the
two
pounds
in
advance
the
news
communicated
in
halting
accents
by
kemp
was
received
with
flattering
dismay
bradshaw
refused
to
believe
her
ears
and
it
was
only
after
the
information
had
been
repeated
and
confirmed
by
wright
that
she
understood
must
go
said
kemp
spent
over
eleven
pounds
cabling
but
it
all
no
you
coming
back
said
hills
course
i
am
was
the
reply
is
the
only
relation
i
got
and
i
got
to
look
after
him
i
suppose
after
all
blood
is
thicker
than
hear
said
bradshaw
piously
there
you
and
bella
continued
kemp
of
the
best
that
ever
the
ladies
looked
down
charlie
hills
i
do
know
i
do
know
i
took
such
a
fancy
to
anybody
as
i
have
to
if
i
was
a
young
gal
a
single
young
gal
he
the
other
half
he
said
slowly
as
he
paused
the
one
i
should
fancy
he
a
it
mild
interrupted
the
blushing
hills
as
wright
bestowed
a
ferocious
glance
upon
the
speaker
lively
young
fellow
concluded
kemp
said
wright
going
now
i
got
to
catch
the
train
for
southampton
but
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
i
prefer
to
be
alone
you
stay
here
and
cheer
them
up
oh
and
before
i
forget
it
lend
me
a
couple
o
pounds
out
that
fifty
i
gave
you
last
night
i
given
all
my
small
change
he
looked
up
and
met
wright
eye
the
latter
too
affected
to
speak
took
out
the
money
and
passed
it
over
never
know
what
may
happen
to
us
said
the
old
man
solemnly
as
he
rose
and
buttoned
his
coat
an
old
man
and
i
like
to
have
things
i
spent
nearly
the
whole
day
with
my
lawyer
and
if
anything
to
my
old
carcass
it
wo
make
any
difference
i
have
left
half
my
money
to
george
half
of
all
i
have
is
to
be
in
the
midst
of
an
awed
silence
he
went
round
and
shook
hands
other
half
with
his
hand
on
the
door
other
half
and
my
best
gold
watch
and
chain
i
have
left
to
my
dear
young
pal
charlie
hills
georgie
makyth
the
appeared
to
be
out
of
sorts
his
movements
were
even
slower
than
usual
and
when
he
sat
the
seemed
to
be
unable
to
give
satisfaction
his
face
bore
an
expression
of
deep
melancholy
but
a
smouldering
gleam
in
his
eye
betokened
feelings
deeply
moved
i
do
hold
with
he
burst
out
with
sudden
ferocity
did
i
do
say
i
ai
been
to
a
theayter
once
or
twice
in
my
life
but
i
always
come
away
with
the
idea
that
anybody
could
act
if
they
liked
to
try
it
a
kid
game
a
silly
kid
game
dressing
up
and
pretending
to
be
somebody
he
cut
off
a
piece
of
tobacco
and
stowing
it
in
his
left
cheek
sat
chewing
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
wharves
across
the
river
the
offensive
antics
of
a
lighterman
in
who
nearly
fell
overboard
in
his
efforts
to
attract
his
attention
he
ignored
might
ha
known
it
too
he
said
after
a
long
silence
i
only
stopped
to
think
instead
o
being
in
such
a
hurry
to
do
good
to
others
i
should
ha
been
all
right
and
the
pack
o
swabs
on
the
and
wot
calls
themselves
would
had
to
got
something
else
to
laugh
about
they
told
it
in
every
pub
for
a
mile
round
and
last
night
when
i
went
into
the
town
of
margate
to
get
a
drink
three
chaps
climbed
over
the
partition
to
a
look
at
me
all
began
with
young
ted
sawyer
the
mate
o
the
and
he
calls
himself
a
mate
but
if
it
was
for
the
skipper
for
a
be
called
something
else
very
quick
two
or
three
times
we
words
over
one
thing
and
another
and
the
last
time
i
called
something
that
i
can
see
now
was
a
mistake
it
was
one
these
clever
things
that
a
man
do
forget
let
alone
a
monkey
like
was
when
they
was
up
time
afore
last
and
when
they
made
fast
last
week
i
could
see
as
he
forgotten
it
for
one
thing
he
pretended
not
to
see
me
and
arter
i
told
him
wot
i
do
to
him
if
ran
into
me
agin
he
said
thought
i
was
a
sack
o
potatoes
taking
a
airing
on
a
pair
of
legs
wot
somebody
throwed
away
nasty
tongue
got
not
clever
but
nasty
that
i
took
no
notice
of
and
o
course
that
annoyed
more
than
anything
all
i
could
do
i
done
and
was
ringing
the
that
night
from
five
minutes
to
twelve
till
afore
i
heard
it
many
a
gets
a
name
for
going
to
sleep
when
only
getting
a
bit
of
own
back
stood
there
talking
for
over
arter
i
in
leastways
he
did
and
whenever
i
see
as
he
was
getting
tired
i
just
said
and
start
agin
as
fresh
as
ever
he
tumbled
to
it
at
last
and
went
aboard
shaking
little
fist
at
me
and
telling
me
wot
he
do
to
me
if
it
was
for
the
lor
kept
by
the
gate
as
soon
as
i
came
on
dooty
next
evening
just
to
give
a
little
smile
as
went
out
there
is
nothing
more
aggravating
than
a
smile
when
it
is
properly
done
but
there
was
no
signs
o
my
lord
and
arter
practising
it
on
a
carman
by
mistake
i
to
go
inside
for
a
bit
and
wait
till
he
gorn
coast
was
clear
by
the
time
i
went
back
and
i
just
stepped
outside
with
my
back
up
agin
the
to
a
pipe
when
i
see
a
boy
coming
along
with
a
bag
lad
of
about
fifteen
was
nicely
dressed
in
a
serge
suit
and
he
no
sooner
gets
up
to
me
than
puts
down
the
bag
and
looks
up
at
me
with
a
timid
sort
o
little
smile
evening
he
ses
was
the
fust
that
has
made
that
mistake
older
people
than
have
done
it
evening
my
lad
i
ses
he
ses
in
a
trembling
voice
suppose
you
ai
looking
out
for
a
sir
i
ses
i
ai
run
away
from
to
go
to
sea
he
ses
and
i
afraid
of
being
pursued
can
i
come
inside
i
could
say
he
come
bag
and
all
and
afore
i
could
say
anything
else
he
nipped
into
the
office
and
stood
there
with
his
on
his
chest
panting
know
i
can
trust
you
he
ses
can
see
it
by
your
you
run
away
from
for
i
ses
they
been
of
you
me
he
ses
with
a
laugh
much
why
i
expect
my
father
is
running
about
all
over
the
place
offering
rewards
for
me
he
would
lose
me
for
a
thousand
pounds
pricked
up
my
ears
at
that
i
do
deny
it
anybody
would
besides
i
knew
it
would
be
doing
him
a
kindness
to
hand
back
to
father
and
then
i
did
a
bit
o
thinking
to
see
it
was
to
be
done
down
i
ses
putting
three
or
four
ledgers
on
the
floor
behind
one
of
the
desks
down
and
let
talk
it
over

away
for
ever
so
long
but
do
all
i
would
i
persuade

stuffed
full
of
coral
islands
and
smugglers
and
pirates
and
foreign
ports

blue
billers

ses
heaving
blue
billers
is
wot
i
want
tried
to
explain
to
who
would
be
doing
the
heaving
but
would
listen
to
me
he
sat
on
them
ledgers
like
a
little
wooden
image
looking
up
at
me
and
shaking
his
and
when
i
told
of
storms
and
shipwrecks
he
just
smacked
lips
and
his
blue
eyes
shone
with
joy
arter
a
time
i
saw
it
was
no
good
trying
to
persuade
and
i
pretended
to
give
way
think
i
can
get
you
a
ship
with
a
friend
o
mine
i
ses

land
i
send
a
letter
with
no

saying

seem
to

it
at
fust
and
said

arter
i
pointed
out
that

forget
and
that
i
was
responsible

way
and
told
me
that

was
named
watson
and
he
kept
a
big
draper
shop
in
the
commercial
road
talked
a
bit
arter

just
to

suspicions
and
then
i
told

on
the
floor
out
of
sight
of
the
window
while
i
went
to

a
young
ordinary
seaman
wot

said
he
would
sooner

i
believe

but
i
was
feeling
too
upset
to
take
much
notice
miserable
wo
bring
back
to
life
agin
ses
the
skipper
looking
up
at
me
and
shaking
his
better

down
to
my
cabin
and
get

a
drop
o
whisky
there
a
bottle
on
the
table

your
wits
about
you
when
the
police

and
wotever

criminating
for
all
right
ses
the
cook
i
was
the
pore
gal
i
haunt
ses
the
ordinary
seaman
night
of
life
i
stand
afore
dripping
with
water
and
moaning
she
will
ses
the
cook
so
at
any
rate
did
answer
i
was
too
besides
which
i
got
a
of
ghosts
and
the
idea
of
being
on
the
wharf
alone
of
a
night
arter
such
a
thing
was
too
much
for
me
i
went
on
board
the
and
annie
and
down
in
the
cabin
i
found
a
bottle
o
whisky
as
the
skipper
said
i
sat
down
on
the
locker
and
a
glass
and
then
i
sat
worrying
and
wondering
wot
was
to
be
the
end
of
it
all
whisky
warmed
me
up
a
bit
and
i
just
taken
up
the
bottle
to
myself
agin
when
i
a
faint
sort
o
sound
in
the
i
put
the
bottle
down
and
listened
but
everything
seemed
deathly
still
i
took
it
up
agin
and
just
poured
out
a
drop
whisky
when
i
distinctly
a
hissing
noise
and
then
a
little
moan
a
moment
i
sat
turned
to
stone
then
i
put
the
bottle
down
quiet
and
just
got
up
to
go
when
the
door
of
the
opened
and
i
saw
the
drownded
gal
with
little
face
and
hair
all
wet
and
dripping
standing
before
me
sawyer
been
telling
everybody
that
i
came
up
the
like
a
that
lost
its
ma
i
wonder
how
he
come
up
if
he
the
evening
i
had
were
all
on
the
jetty
as
i
got
there
and
tumbled
into
the
arms
and
all
asking
at
once
wot
was
the
matter
when
i
got
my
breath
back
a
bit
and
told
they
laughed
all
except
the
cook
and
said
it
was
only
wot
i
might
expect
then
like
a
man
in
a
dream
i
see
the
gal
come
out
of
the
companion
and
walk
slowly
to
the
side
i
ses
there
she
is
dreaming
ses
the
skipper
nothing
there
all
said
the
same
even
when
the
gal
stepped
on
to
the
side
and
climbed
on
to
the
wharf
she
came
along
towards
me
with
arms
held
close
to
sides
and
making
the
most
faces
at
me
and
it
took
five
all
their
time
to
me
the
wharf
and
everything
seemed
to
me
to
spin
round
and
round
then
she
came
straight
up
to
me
and
patted
me
on
the
cheek
old
gentleman
she
ses
a
shame
it
is
ted
it
too
bad
let
go
o
me
then
and
stamped
up
and
down
the
jetty
laughing
fit
to
kill
themselves
if
they
only
known
wot
a
exhibition
they
was
making
of
themselves
and
i
pitied
them
they
would
ha
done
it
and
by
and
by
ted
wiped
his
eyes
and
put
his
arm
round
the
gal
waist
and
ses
is
my
intended
miss
florrie
price
he
ses
she
a
little
wonder
wot
d
think
of
keep
my
own
opinion
i
ses
ai
got
nothing
to
say
against
gals
but
if
i
only
lay
my
hands
on
that
young
brother
of
went
off
agin
then
worse
than
ever
and
at
last
the
cook
came
and
put
skinny
arm
round
my
neck
and
started
spluttering
in
my
ear
i
shoved
off
hard
because
i
see
it
all
then
and
i
should
ha
seen
it
afore
only
i
did
time
to
think
i
do
bear
no
malice
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
do
wish
any
harder
punishment
than
to
be
married
to
ted
